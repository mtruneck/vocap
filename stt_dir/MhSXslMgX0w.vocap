###7 
###32 KOOS VAN DEN AKKER: My name is Koos Van Den Akker, which is a
###35 Dutch name.
###36 I'm from Holland.
###38 I was in Paris first.
###39 I learned my trade at Christian
###42 Dior, 1960 'til 1965.
###46 Then I went back to Holland and had my own store in the
###49 Hague where I was born.
###51 But you know the Dutch--
###53 Holland was not set up for fashion, it was totally
###55 ridiculous.
###56 I mean, I came with all those Dior fantasies and all those
###60 women that were like cows there.
###63 All they wanted was a skirt with extra pieces in front of
###67 skirts so that the knees wouldn't wear out too fast.
###70 You know, that kind of stuff.
###71 This was 1960.
###73 And so I always wanted to come to this country ever since I
###77 saw "Breakfast at Tiffany's." I've been in this country
###80 since 1968 and made a career here, 40 years, and never
###86 looked back.
###87 
###89 This is my work room and this is the people I work with.
###94 Beatrice is here.
###95 Beatrice has been with me for 28 years.
###100 28, 29, yeah?
###103 BEATRICE: [INAUDIBLE]
###104 29.
###104 KOOS VAN DEN AKKER: Amazing, huh?
###106 This is Javier.
###109 And Javier works with the customers.
###112 So when there is stuff to be done in the store for those
###116 women, Javier is the one that likes to do that.
###119 So he fusses with those women.
###121 JAVIER: Fuss.
###122 KOOS VAN DEN AKKER: And is good with it, too.
###123 
###127 Part of my legacy in this business is making the Bill
###131 Cosby sweater.
###133 The ones that I made for Bill Cosby and the ones that I made
###136 in that period were all one-of-a-kind sweaters.
###139 See, this is a typical Cosby sweater.
###142 So the base is a jersey, so it's stretchy.
###147 And then usually I use woolens and jerseys together and make
###152 this kind of arrangement.
###154 And in those days in the early '80s, it was
###158 very much of patterns.
###161 Now you have to realize, when you look at this now it's
###165 familiar because all the fashion today is like that.
###168 When I did this there was nothing like that around, so
###173 people were just freaked out.
###174 They said what the fuck is that?
###176 MALE SPEAKER: Are these sweaters that
###178 he wore on the show?
###179 KOOS VAN DEN AKKER: Those were the Cosby sweaters, yeah, that
###181 I got back for this occasion.
###184 This is a very thin line between absolutely awful and
###189 something of genius.
###191 I mean, somebody can look at it and say
###193 what the fuck is this?
###194 This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen.
###196 And somebody else says it's inspiration.
###202 All this collaging, all this graphic stuff that I do,
###207 painting with fabrics, was exceptional here but in
###212 Holland it was everywhere.
###214 So I was really the guy.
###216 I was totally original.
###219 When I did it then, people really couldn't figure out was
###222 this home sewing or was this genius?
###224 And they didn't go for genius, believe me.
###227 They went for home sewing.
###228 
###236 I had a friend, a black actress
###240 called Josephine Premice.
###241 And she was a good customer and she was a
###244 friend of Bill Cosby.
###245 And so one day she came to me and she said listen, I have to
###248 have a present for Bill.
###249 Would you make him a sweater or something?
###252 And I said sure.
###253 And so she went to see him and gave him the sweater and he
###257 liked it very much.
###258 So he went on the set with the sweater on.
###263 Well, that episode got so many letters, apparently, asking
###267 where did he get this sweater?
###268 What the hell was that?
###271 That he called and he said listen, this is a big success.
###274 Would you make me more?
###275 And I said absolutely, sure, why not.
###278 And so that was it.
###279 And all of a sudden there they were on TV, and it was a kick
###282 and it was totally fun.
###283 And then I got to know him, of course.
###285 And Bill Cosby was just a delightful man who very much
###290 appreciated my work and the way I worked,
###296 and supported it.
###297 And that's basically the story and I was very
###300 thankful for that.
###301 You know, fabrics is never important to me what it costs.
###305 I can work with $2 a yard fabric, I can work with $50 a
###310 yard fabric.
###311 I prefer the $2 a yard fabric.
###313 Here, this is my table and it's an
###315 enormous mess right now.
###317 So this is a paper pattern of a skirt.
###321 I pick a primary fabric, which will be this one.
###326 And so I will cut a skirt out of that.
###331 And then when I have that flat, then I think well, what
###338 would work with this?
###340 Nothing is by chance--
###342 you compose it.
###346 There is no reason why this is here and not there, of course.
###351 To my eye, this looks good.
###354 And so then you press it down, you pin it down, and then you
###358 make the whole thing.
###360 And that's basically the process of it.
###362 It's painting with fabrics.
###365 It's making pictures one after another and just happen to be
###368 clothes, and that's it.
###370 I never cared about was it washable?
###373 Can you clean it?
###374 I couldn't care less.
###376 Never was a problem with me--
###378 no, didn't care.
###380 I have a new thing now with the ribbons that look like
###384 Arabic writing, and I think it's very beautiful.
###387 And it looks like, again, those countries where we have
###390 trouble with where everything is beautiful, really.
###395 There's nothing more beautiful than that.
###398 Here is a man who is totally comfortable in his
###401 clothes, in his skin.
###402 A practical and how absolutely beautiful.
###406 But everything in this book is things I wish I could put it
###411 together as beautiful.
###413 Look, everything is with great dignity, beautiful,
###418 beautiful--
###420 this to me is fashion, this is my inspiration.
###426 When you talk about collaging, this is collage.
###429 This is totally beauty, this is pure beauty.
###433 That is just the best.
###436 I did a master class in San Francisco at the Academy of
###440 Art College.
###442 And all those kids looked so hot with all the
###445 tattoos and all that.
###446 And so one day I thought well, if I don't do it now I'll
###448 never do it.
###449 I called a friend, and I said listen, I
###451 want a tattoo by tonight.
###453 So we went to the Chinatown and he talked to some old
###456 Chinese gentleman.
###457 
###460 I wanted it to say "new beginnings," so he asked the
###463 old man to write down new beginnings in Chinese and he
###466 wrote it down.
###467 Then with the piece of paper, we went to a tattoo parlor.
###472 And I said I want it to look like a piece of fabric, like a
###475 swatch with polka dots, and I want that on it.
###479 And, of course, needless to say, the next day when I got
###482 to school I was the guy.
###484 I was the man.
###485 I was totally like oh, shit, this is cool.
###490 And of course it was, I mean, 70-year-old man who all of a
###494 sudden has a tattoo?
###495 It's nice.
###497 In San Francisco I had a big classroom that was mine.
###500 So I photographed the walls here as they are.
###504 And the photo department in that school-- it's a very
###507 fancy school--
###508 had it all done exactly the same size as the
###512 walls in the school.
###513 So my area in the school was exactly like this, except
###517 everything was photos.
###518 This was all photos, you couldn't take these glasses,
###520 it was all photo.
###523 And then there where all the other tables where the kids
###526 were working and eight machines where they were
###528 working on.
###529 So I was in my own workroom.
###530 It's still there, because I go back there in July and I go
###534 back to my room.
###536 Fashion and the fashion world, I couldn't care less.
###539 It's so overrated and silly and all that.
###542 It's not my life-- never was.
###544 I like to put fabrics together.
###547 So if I could make pillows for the rest of my
###549 life I probably would.
###551 I love sewing, you know?
###552 I don't consider myself a designer and all
###555 that shit, I'm not.
###557 If I had become famous by doing couches and walls, I
###563 would have never made a dress.
###564 I don't like women.
###565 I don't like working with them.
###566 I don't fuss with women at all, that's why I'm
###569 never in the store.
###571 They need more psychiatrists than they need a designer.
###575 That doesn't help when you need PR.
###579 You say you don't really like women, well hey, then you're
###584 not in the right corner.
###585 
###604 This is a great guy in San Francisco called Bullwinkle
###609 and we exchange clothes for artworks.
###611 This is me in 1981, and then this is me two years ago.
###619 That happened to be a nice photo, but the contrast is
###624 pretty shocking.
###625 This one's nice-- that was in a show in Houston, Texas.
###629 I had done the screen and I was probably about
###633 45-years-old there.
###635 Those were dear friends of mine who died.
###638 They all died.
###639 So many people that are gone, but that's just
###644 part of life, right?
###645 Those were my cats.
###647 And I had two, this one and that one.
###650 And they became very old and they died on the top of
###653 fabrics and all that.
###654 I just called, the doctor came here, gave
###656 them a little thing.
###657 And the nice thing is that he died on a piece of brocade.
###664 He didn't even know, he never even opened his eyes.
###666 He got a shot and that was the end of that.
###669 And they took him away and I made a beautiful
###671 jacket out of it.
###672 And the woman that wore that jacket never knew that some
###674 cat had died right on top of it.
###676 
###687 It's horrible to look at yourself in the mirror and see
###690 this old guy.
###692 Inside I'm nothing older than you.
###694 How old are you?
###695 MALE SPEAKER: I'm 29.
###696 KOOS VAN DEN AKKER: Yeah, nice.
###698 I'm nothing older than that, and then yet, I am.
###701 I used to wear my own clothes when I was younger.
###703 Now it doesn't really matter anymore.
###708 I'm comfortable in just what I wear now.
###713 Yeah, it's a rich life, it's a rich career.
###717 If I drop dead tomorrow, I've really done it all.
###720 I've made a lot of people happy.
###722 I've been with lots of young people.
###725 Showed them the way, very nice and enjoyed it.
###730 Made my own families with people that were with me.
###733 The ladies in the other room, one of them is
###736 28 years with me.
###738 It's family stuff.
###739 It's just family.
###740 And it's rich, totally rich.
###743
