1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:28,47



2
0:0:28,47 --> 0:0:29,88
SAMIR KRIM: That was
a fun cruise.


3
0:0:29,88 --> 0:0:32,1
Like, we would just go from
Bastille, which is on the


4
0:0:32,1 --> 0:0:34,93
other side of town, and we would
just ride, you know?


5
0:0:34,93 --> 0:0:36,26
All along the Seine.


6
0:0:36,26 --> 0:0:39,22
Come skate that spot, then go
skate that spot, then go skate


7
0:0:39,22 --> 0:0:40,49
the museum.


8
0:0:40,49 --> 0:0:42,76
And in the day, you just went
through the whole city.


9
0:0:42,76 --> 0:1:1,38



10
0:1:1,38 --> 0:1:3,49
This is Rue des Saints Peres.


11
0:1:3,49 --> 0:1:6,29
It's a cool spot we used to hang
out, back then when they


12
0:1:6,29 --> 0:1:7,596
didn't put this bar.


13
0:1:7,596 --> 0:1:9,49
It used to be just
manual pads.


14
0:1:9,49 --> 0:1:11,51
You go from the top, and
you just go down.


15
0:1:11,51 --> 0:1:13,15
You don't even have to push.


16
0:1:13,15 --> 0:1:15,7
Just manual, trick, manual,
trick, and then [INAUDIBLE]


17
0:1:15,7 --> 0:1:18,605
at the end.


18
0:1:18,605 --> 0:1:18,87
SAMIR KRIM: No.


19
0:1:18,87 --> 0:1:19,36
See?


20
0:1:19,36 --> 0:1:21,57
There's no one now, because
you've got to have a little


21
0:1:21,57 --> 0:1:23,65
pop to skate the thing.


22
0:1:23,65 --> 0:1:30,76



23
0:1:30,76 --> 0:1:32,66
It's dead now.


24
0:1:32,66 --> 0:1:34,78
It's so bad, because in the
middle of Paris here was a


25
0:1:34,78 --> 0:1:35,52
cool hangout spot.


26
0:1:35,52 --> 0:1:37,6
And you're in the nice
neighborhood.


27
0:1:37,6 --> 0:1:39,97
This is actually the
Medical University.


28
0:1:39,97 --> 0:1:42,29
The girl's still coming out.


29
0:1:42,29 --> 0:1:43,68
It's very funny.


30
0:1:43,68 --> 0:1:47,536
-Do Parisian girls
like skaters?


31
0:1:47,536 --> 0:1:50,43
SAMIR KRIM: I don't know.


32
0:1:50,43 --> 0:1:52,73
They don't like Joseph,
though.


33
0:1:52,73 --> 0:1:55,64
I don't think it's nice to pick
up girls with the line,


34
0:1:55,64 --> 0:1:57,51
hey, I skate.


35
0:1:57,51 --> 0:1:59,26
It's just like a hobby
here, you know?


36
0:1:59,26 --> 0:1:59,5
You skate.


37
0:1:59,5 --> 0:1:59,88
That's a hobby.


38
0:1:59,88 --> 0:2:0,4
That's it.


39
0:2:0,4 --> 0:2:2,87
Maybe like 10 people here in
France live out of skating,


40
0:2:2,87 --> 0:2:6,93
but the rest is just
for fun, you know?


41
0:2:6,93 --> 0:2:8,18
JOSEPH BIAIS: [SPEAKING FRENCH]


42
0:2:8,18 --> 0:2:19,42



43
0:2:19,42 --> 0:2:21,71
SAMIR KRIM: He always picks on
me for not skating around, and


44
0:2:21,71 --> 0:2:23,7
just sticking [INAUDIBLE].


45
0:2:23,7 --> 0:2:26,96
And I'm like, yo, when I was
your age, me and my friends,


46
0:2:26,96 --> 0:2:29,66
we used to just skate all around
the city, cruising,


47
0:2:29,66 --> 0:2:30,91
finding new spots.


48
0:2:30,91 --> 0:2:41,73



49
0:2:41,73 --> 0:2:42,243
I'm older now.


50
0:2:42,243 --> 0:2:44,7
I'm like 10 years older than
him, and if I go out for


51
0:2:44,7 --> 0:2:46,16
skating, it's like,
I got two hours.


52
0:2:46,16 --> 0:2:48,8
So I'm just going to go to a
spot, meet up with the boys,


53
0:2:48,8 --> 0:2:50,47
and just skate, you know?


54
0:2:50,47 --> 0:2:51,63
He's always like, yo,
let's go cruise.


55
0:2:51,63 --> 0:2:53,47
And I'm like, I did that.


56
0:2:53,47 --> 0:2:55,29
We did that.


57
0:2:55,29 --> 0:3:1,12
JOSEPH BIAIS: [SPEAKING FRENCH]


58
0:3:1,12 --> 0:3:3,23
SAMIR KRIM: He's always like,
oh, you used to skate there.


59
0:3:3,23 --> 0:3:4,748
You used to skate there.


60
0:3:4,748 --> 0:3:6,74
Like, yeah.


61
0:3:6,74 --> 0:3:8,732
JOSEPH BIAIS: [SPEAKING FRENCH]


62
0:3:8,732 --> 0:3:15,72



63
0:3:15,72 --> 0:3:17,2
SAMIR KRIM: He always skates
with different people.


64
0:3:17,2 --> 0:3:20,94
Like, anyone is in town, he
will go skate with him.


65
0:3:20,94 --> 0:3:22,415
That's what's cool with him.


66
0:3:22,415 --> 0:3:24,5
In it for the right reasons.


67
0:3:24,5 --> 0:3:26,76



68
0:3:26,76 --> 0:3:28,67
We're in Bastille right now.


69
0:3:28,67 --> 0:3:30,96
Bastille is center
of the city.


70
0:3:30,96 --> 0:3:32,27
It's my center of the city.


71
0:3:32,27 --> 0:3:33,98
That's where I grew up.


72
0:3:33,98 --> 0:3:37,4
I grew up like a block from
here, and it's really like my


73
0:3:37,4 --> 0:3:38,9
neighborhood here.


74
0:3:38,9 --> 0:3:40,15
[SPEAKING FRENCH]


75
0:3:40,15 --> 0:3:51,63



76
0:3:51,63 --> 0:3:53,73
It became actually one real spot
here in Paris, because it


77
0:3:53,73 --> 0:3:56,26
was one of the first ledge
spots we really had


78
0:3:56,26 --> 0:3:57,68
downtown, you know?


79
0:3:57,68 --> 0:4:1,34
-Who was the first person
you saw skate here?


80
0:4:1,34 --> 0:4:3,2
SAMIR KRIM: I think the
first one is these


81
0:4:3,2 --> 0:4:4,55
guys from Mad Circle--


82
0:4:4,55 --> 0:4:8,26
Scott Johnston, Rene Matthyssen,
and I think Rob


83
0:4:8,26 --> 0:4:9,88
[INAUDIBLE] was there too.


84
0:4:9,88 --> 0:4:12,67
I was going out of school, and
every night after school, I


85
0:4:12,67 --> 0:4:14,3
would meet up my friends here.


86
0:4:14,3 --> 0:4:16,82
I think I showed up early, like
around 5:00 or something,


87
0:4:16,82 --> 0:4:19,74
and I'm just here alone with
those guys, and the skating.


88
0:4:19,74 --> 0:4:20,99
It was just crazy.


89
0:4:20,99 --> 0:4:25,22



90
0:4:25,22 --> 0:4:27,62
And then one day, they put those
anti-skate things to


91
0:4:27,62 --> 0:4:29,18
keep us away from here.


92
0:4:29,18 --> 0:4:30,43
JOSEPH BIAIS: [SPEAKING FRENCH]


93
0:4:30,43 --> 0:4:36,88



94
0:4:36,88 --> 0:4:39,19
SAMIR KRIM: [SPEAKING FRENCH]


95
0:4:39,19 --> 0:4:42,24
JOSEPH BIAIS: [SPEAKING FRENCH]


96
0:4:42,24 --> 0:4:42,84
SAMIR KRIM: There's
a lot to skate.


97
0:4:42,84 --> 0:4:46,58
Like, these little gaps, this
ledge, the little manual pad


98
0:4:46,58 --> 0:4:47,57
right there.


99
0:4:47,57 --> 0:4:49,7
It's a generation
thing, you know?


100
0:4:49,7 --> 0:4:51,23
It's like, there's always a new
spot, new group of people,


101
0:4:51,23 --> 0:4:53,58
then it's going to be the
next one, and then--


102
0:4:53,58 --> 0:4:55,28
so we're just at that time.


103
0:4:55,28 --> 0:4:56,3
That timing.


104
0:4:56,3 --> 0:4:57,28
It was us skating here.


105
0:4:57,28 --> 0:5:4,56



106
0:5:4,56 --> 0:5:6,47
There's a lot of memories
when I come here.


107
0:5:6,47 --> 0:5:9,7
I just remember a
lot of things--


108
0:5:9,7 --> 0:5:11,38
the people that skate here
with us, the stories that


109
0:5:11,38 --> 0:5:12,5
happened to us, you know?


110
0:5:12,5 --> 0:5:15,63
One day, one guy just shot
himself right there.


111
0:5:15,63 --> 0:5:18,18
We were trying to go to the
phone, and trying to call the


112
0:5:18,18 --> 0:5:19,61
police and stuff, and
the guy is just--


113
0:5:19,61 --> 0:5:20,77
he missed himself, you know?


114
0:5:20,77 --> 0:5:22,48
He's just on the floor
like that, with a


115
0:5:22,48 --> 0:5:23,73
little bit of blood.


116
0:5:23,73 --> 0:5:35,76



117
0:5:35,76 --> 0:5:39,35
JOSEPH BIAIS: So where I live,
the train station is just in


118
0:5:39,35 --> 0:5:40,93
front of my house.


119
0:5:40,93 --> 0:5:45,53
So I just have to walk for 20
seconds, take the train, and I


120
0:5:45,53 --> 0:5:47,45
am in the center of Paris.


121
0:5:47,45 --> 0:5:49,766
-Did you tell your parents the
first time you were going to


122
0:5:49,766 --> 0:5:50,258
skate here?


123
0:5:50,258 --> 0:5:50,75
JOSEPH BIAIS: No.


124
0:5:50,75 --> 0:5:54,0
I didn't tell them, because they
were afraid about that,


125
0:5:54,0 --> 0:5:57,19
because I was young,
and alone, and very


126
0:5:57,19 --> 0:5:59,75
far from the house.


127
0:5:59,75 --> 0:6:0,67
They don't really like it.


128
0:6:0,67 --> 0:6:5,19
So the first time I went with
a couple of friends, and we


129
0:6:5,19 --> 0:6:6,44
skated the city.


130
0:6:6,44 --> 0:6:11,26



131
0:6:11,26 --> 0:6:13,47
SAMIR KRIM: Yeah, that's what
skating's all about, right?


132
0:6:13,47 --> 0:6:15,23
Pushing the limit.


133
0:6:15,23 --> 0:6:17,43
Everyone's like, don't
go further than this.


134
0:6:17,43 --> 0:6:19,95
I remember the first time we
went to Bercy was such an


135
0:6:19,95 --> 0:6:22,84
expedition for us.


136
0:6:22,84 --> 0:6:24,444
My mom was like,
never go there.


137
0:6:24,444 --> 0:6:27,76



138
0:6:27,76 --> 0:6:30,66
I think a lot of people from
Europe come here to just film


139
0:6:30,66 --> 0:6:33,5
lines because it looks
good in their video.


140
0:6:33,5 --> 0:6:36,556
It's a famous spot, so people
are like, all right, I had a


141
0:6:36,556 --> 0:6:39,2
line at that Bercy spot, or I
jumped on the [INAUDIBLE].


142
0:6:39,2 --> 0:6:42,1
JOSEPH BIAIS: Maybe it's the
most easy spot to find,


143
0:6:42,1 --> 0:6:43,76
because everybody knows
the name is Bercy.


144
0:6:43,76 --> 0:6:44,62
SAMIR KRIM: It's easy
to find too.


145
0:6:44,62 --> 0:6:44,98
The subway's right there.


146
0:6:44,98 --> 0:6:46,16
You go, and then it's it.


147
0:6:46,16 --> 0:6:49,68
You see the skaters, and
they're right there.


148
0:6:49,68 --> 0:6:51,695
Ledges all around.


149
0:6:51,695 --> 0:6:55,52
This gap for the people that
want to jump or die.


150
0:6:55,52 --> 0:6:58,18



151
0:6:58,18 --> 0:7:0,89
We didn't start skating that
until the mid-'90s.


152
0:7:0,89 --> 0:7:5,17
I remember like when we came
here and put the first wax on


153
0:7:5,17 --> 0:7:8,48
this ledge, because before,
skating was just, like, little


154
0:7:8,48 --> 0:7:9,38
ledge, little curb.


155
0:7:9,38 --> 0:7:10,4
Just trying to ollie it.


156
0:7:10,4 --> 0:7:14,48
And you know, by the end of the
'90s, skating was a lot of


157
0:7:14,48 --> 0:7:17,58
ledge, so it became
a paradise for us.


158
0:7:17,58 --> 0:7:21,332
We'd come here every day, stay
here all day, all night.


159
0:7:21,332 --> 0:7:43,472



160
0:7:43,472 --> 0:7:44,948
-Perfect.


161
0:7:44,948 --> 0:7:54,85



162
0:7:54,85 --> 0:7:56,95
We were filming for a video
in '95 or something.


163
0:7:56,95 --> 0:7:58,42
We just came here.


164
0:7:58,42 --> 0:8:2,345
[INAUDIBLE], and just broke my
ankle, and I never skated that


165
0:8:2,345 --> 0:8:3,49
thing again.


166
0:8:3,49 --> 0:8:4,74
JOSEPH BIAIS: [SPEAKING FRENCH]


167
0:8:4,74 --> 0:8:28,4



168
0:8:28,4 --> 0:8:29,5
SAMIR KRIM: Go, go, go.


169
0:8:29,5 --> 0:8:30,3
Jump.


170
0:8:30,3 --> 0:8:33,21



171
0:8:33,21 --> 0:8:35,363
They think like some
guy [INAUDIBLE].


172
0:8:35,363 --> 0:8:37,255
How fuckin' crazy is that?


173
0:8:37,255 --> 0:8:42,47



174
0:8:42,47 --> 0:8:46,94
-Who's the real French
street skater?


175
0:8:46,94 --> 0:8:48,84
SAMIR KRIM: For me,
Stephane was.


176
0:8:48,84 --> 0:8:51,6
Everywhere you go, you see
Stephane Larance skating.


177
0:8:51,6 --> 0:8:52,337
He was so good.


178
0:8:52,337 --> 0:8:53,53
He could do everything.


179
0:8:53,53 --> 0:8:57,92
I'm talking 12 years ago, 15
years ago, he was all the way


180
0:8:57,92 --> 0:8:59,392
on top of everything.


181
0:8:59,392 --> 0:9:3,41
I saw him skate here, skate at
the dome, skate everywhere.


182
0:9:3,41 --> 0:9:4,17
Skate the wave.


183
0:9:4,17 --> 0:9:5,255
He would just skate
everything.


184
0:9:5,255 --> 0:9:7,375
He was very, very good.


185
0:9:7,375 --> 0:9:9,29
JOSEPH BIAIS: Stephane was
the most famous Parisian.


186
0:9:9,29 --> 0:9:9,92
skater.


187
0:9:9,92 --> 0:9:13,2
Because I'm not from Paris, I am
from the suburbs, and when


188
0:9:13,2 --> 0:9:18,45
I was very young, I used to come
in Paris and have a one


189
0:9:18,45 --> 0:9:20,7
hour train journey
to come here.


190
0:9:20,7 --> 0:9:24,32
And so I was coming to the dome
and saying, oh, there's


191
0:9:24,32 --> 0:9:25,57
Stephane Larance.


192
0:9:25,57 --> 0:9:29,11



193
0:9:29,11 --> 0:9:30,35
STEPHANE LARANCE: We're at
the dome, one of the


194
0:9:30,35 --> 0:9:31,63
main spots in Paris.


195
0:9:31,63 --> 0:9:34,9
It's pretty cool, because you
can just come no matter the


196
0:9:34,9 --> 0:9:35,56
weather or the time.


197
0:9:35,56 --> 0:9:39,37
There will always
be skaters here.


198
0:9:39,37 --> 0:9:41,36
It's really crazy because it's
all marble and it's pretty


199
0:9:41,36 --> 0:9:42,84
smooth and open space.


200
0:9:42,84 --> 0:9:44,952
And people just let us skate.


201
0:9:44,952 --> 0:9:48,89



202
0:9:48,89 --> 0:9:51,61
There was always a big
scene in Paris.


203
0:9:51,61 --> 0:9:53,185
And I met one guy that
was a skater that


204
0:9:53,185 --> 0:9:55,53
was skating at Trocadero.


205
0:9:55,53 --> 0:9:58,15
Then we became friends, and he
took me to skate with the guys


206
0:9:58,15 --> 0:9:59,16
at Trocadero.


207
0:9:59,16 --> 0:10:2,95
Then I just came here
every week.


208
0:10:2,95 --> 0:10:4,87
We just came down,
and they were--


209
0:10:4,87 --> 0:10:8,25
actually, there was nothing
here but marble--


210
0:10:8,25 --> 0:10:10,4
like, pieces of marble
everywhere.


211
0:10:10,4 --> 0:10:12,87
And we were just looking at this
platform up there, and we


212
0:10:12,87 --> 0:10:15,943
just thought that they were
building a skate spot for us.


213
0:10:15,943 --> 0:10:20,43
-So when they were finishing
down below, this is where you


214
0:10:20,43 --> 0:10:21,15
guys skated?


215
0:10:21,15 --> 0:10:21,71
STEPHANE LARANCE: Yeah,
this is where we


216
0:10:21,71 --> 0:10:22,1
were skating, yeah.


217
0:10:22,1 --> 0:10:27,45
The ledge and the stair were
just going in circles all day.


218
0:10:27,45 --> 0:10:30,85
Some of the best skate memories
have been here.


219
0:10:30,85 --> 0:10:35,66



220
0:10:35,66 --> 0:10:38,2
-Is there a certain trick that
you saw on this ledge that you


221
0:10:38,2 --> 0:10:40,32
were like, man, I can't believe
someone did that.


222
0:10:40,32 --> 0:10:40,67
STEPHANE LARANCE: Yeah.


223
0:10:40,67 --> 0:10:43,17
Flo.


224
0:10:43,17 --> 0:10:44,42
Gnarly Crook.


225
0:10:44,42 --> 0:10:49,86



226
0:10:49,86 --> 0:10:52,355
Flo just killed this spot.


227
0:10:52,355 --> 0:11:7,89



228
0:11:7,89 --> 0:11:9,916
And this spot used
to be so smooth.


229
0:11:9,916 --> 0:11:11,1
It's so good now.


230
0:11:11,1 --> 0:11:12,87
It's all cracked everywhere.


231
0:11:12,87 --> 0:11:15,95
The spot has had too
much success.


232
0:11:15,95 --> 0:11:18,84
If you come here in the
summertimes, so


233
0:11:18,84 --> 0:11:22,6
many skaters here.


234
0:11:22,6 --> 0:11:24,46
-Has it ever been a problem
skating here?


235
0:11:24,46 --> 0:11:24,64
STEPHANE LARANCE: Yeah.


236
0:11:24,64 --> 0:11:25,73
There's always problems.


237
0:11:25,73 --> 0:11:31,83
But every two years or
something, they just try to


238
0:11:31,83 --> 0:11:35,55
get the skaters out of here, and
it just lasts for like a


239
0:11:35,55 --> 0:11:36,36
month or two.


240
0:11:36,36 --> 0:11:40,64
And then, since everybody just
come and skate here anyway,


241
0:11:40,64 --> 0:11:42,35
they just sort of give up.


242
0:11:42,35 --> 0:11:45,2
And so they just let us skate.


243
0:11:45,2 --> 0:11:47,28
-So this was the
big double set.


244
0:11:47,28 --> 0:11:48,75
STEPHANE LARANCE: Yeah.


245
0:11:48,75 --> 0:11:50,71
Pretty big double set.


246
0:11:50,71 --> 0:11:53,73
We've been skating this spot for
a long time, but not a lot


247
0:11:53,73 --> 0:11:54,75
of tricks have been done.


248
0:11:54,75 --> 0:11:58,25
Only a few manage to skate it,
because it takes a lot of


249
0:11:58,25 --> 0:12:1,42
energy to push, then to fall,
then to go back and to push


250
0:12:1,42 --> 0:12:4,37
and to fall.


251
0:12:4,37 --> 0:12:7,42
It's even bigger when
you try to skate it.


252
0:12:7,42 --> 0:12:9,378
It's really big.


253
0:12:9,378 --> 0:12:27,85



254
0:12:27,85 --> 0:12:29,52
"FRENCH" FRED MORTAGNE:
I spent about 15


255
0:12:29,52 --> 0:12:32,61
million hours here.


256
0:12:32,61 --> 0:12:37,98
'94 to, I don't know, '97, '96,
we've been here all the


257
0:12:37,98 --> 0:12:39,64
time filming.


258
0:12:39,64 --> 0:12:43,67
That's where I pretty much
learned filming.


259
0:12:43,67 --> 0:12:45,7
Yeah, this spot is the
main plaza in Lyon.


260
0:12:45,7 --> 0:12:47,98
When they finally finished
it in '94, it


261
0:12:47,98 --> 0:12:50,63
was like, oh, paradise.


262
0:12:50,63 --> 0:12:52,8
When they finished the plaza,
that was the turning point


263
0:12:52,8 --> 0:12:56,57
where skateboarding went back
to the street in Lyon.


264
0:12:56,57 --> 0:13:0,74
Watching the first 411s, there
was virtually all the


265
0:13:0,74 --> 0:13:2,59
skateboard community in 411.


266
0:13:2,59 --> 0:13:5,58
Each new issue, I was like, I'm
sure there's going to be


267
0:13:5,58 --> 0:13:6,34
some French guys.


268
0:13:6,34 --> 0:13:7,17
And they never came.


269
0:13:7,17 --> 0:13:10,945
And I was like, ahh!


270
0:13:10,945 --> 0:13:12,65
So maybe I have to do it.


271
0:13:12,65 --> 0:13:13,18
I'm filming.


272
0:13:13,18 --> 0:13:16,28
Maybe I'll just send footage,
and maybe they want to use it.


273
0:13:16,28 --> 0:13:17,53
And that's what happened.


274
0:13:17,53 --> 0:13:20,33



275
0:13:20,33 --> 0:13:26,96
411 people like Steve Douglas,
I sent him all the VHS videos


276
0:13:26,96 --> 0:13:29,2
from here, and then he was like,
oh, it's really good.


277
0:13:29,2 --> 0:13:32,335
You should send stuff for
411 And then J.B.,


278
0:13:32,335 --> 0:13:33,49
oh, it's really good.


279
0:13:33,49 --> 0:13:37,51
And the second time I
sent a video, J.B.


280
0:13:37,51 --> 0:13:38,73
Had improved a lot.


281
0:13:38,73 --> 0:13:40,27
He was skating really well.


282
0:13:40,27 --> 0:13:42,97
And then they were like,
oh, that's it.


283
0:13:42,97 --> 0:13:44,36
We want [INAUDIBLE].


284
0:13:44,36 --> 0:13:49,74
So I was like, oh, videos
are important.


285
0:13:49,74 --> 0:13:55,62
So that was the first thing that
pushed me to keep going.


286
0:13:55,62 --> 0:13:58,75
And we were doing it for a
purpose, not just for fun.


287
0:13:58,75 --> 0:14:3,376
But it was helping people,
so that was good.


288
0:14:3,376 --> 0:14:4,626
That was a good thing.


289
0:14:4,626 --> 0:14:12,665



290
0:14:12,665 --> 0:14:16,23
As you can see, it's in really
bad condition right now.


291
0:14:16,23 --> 0:14:18,71
I think they redid
the place twice--


292
0:14:18,71 --> 0:14:21,65
completely renewed the ledges.


293
0:14:21,65 --> 0:14:26,62
But they get fucked up really
quick, and then only the other


294
0:14:26,62 --> 0:14:27,87
ones they're really strong.


295
0:14:27,87 --> 0:14:31,94



296
0:14:31,94 --> 0:14:34,4
-What kind of stuff has been
done on this thing?


297
0:14:34,4 --> 0:14:37,25
I mean, again, it seems like
everything I see here is from


298
0:14:37,25 --> 0:14:38,116
J.B., but--


299
0:14:38,116 --> 0:14:39,6
"FRENCH" FRED MORTAGNE: Oh,
Jeremie was skating this thing


300
0:14:39,6 --> 0:14:41,7
in a different way.


301
0:14:41,7 --> 0:14:44,6
It's the only one that I know
that he will lead from one


302
0:14:44,6 --> 0:14:46,99
side to the other straight.


303
0:14:46,99 --> 0:14:48,25
That's pretty difficult.


304
0:14:48,25 --> 0:14:50,47
Yeah, Jeremie is the one who's
been doing all the best stuff,


305
0:14:50,47 --> 0:14:53,77
because there's the crack
at the bottom.


306
0:14:53,77 --> 0:14:58,94
We used to put cement so it
smoothed, but now people got


307
0:14:58,94 --> 0:15:0,22
used to skating it this way.


308
0:15:0,22 --> 0:15:2,97
So when you're not a local, it's
not easy to skate without


309
0:15:2,97 --> 0:15:4,24
the cement.


310
0:15:4,24 --> 0:15:8,21
But Jeremie is like, oh,
it doesn't matter.


311
0:15:8,21 --> 0:15:11,34
JEREMIE DACLIN: When
we were 17, I got


312
0:15:11,34 --> 0:15:12,81
interviewed by French TV.


313
0:15:12,81 --> 0:15:15,805
They were saying, how do
you see your future?


314
0:15:15,805 --> 0:15:22,0
And I said, I don't see myself
skating when I'm 20 years old,


315
0:15:22,0 --> 0:15:24,51
because it's kind of
lame or whatever.


316
0:15:24,51 --> 0:15:27,479
But I'm 35 and I'm
still skating.


317
0:15:27,479 --> 0:15:46,64



318
0:15:46,64 --> 0:15:50,99
I was riding for Flip when they
moved to America, and I


319
0:15:50,99 --> 0:15:52,52
didn't really want to do it.


320
0:15:52,52 --> 0:15:58,56
So I thought the best solution
was to start a Euro company


321
0:15:58,56 --> 0:16:1,81
that can pay riders so they
can stay in Europe.


322
0:16:1,81 --> 0:16:5,14
Lots of good riders were riding
in Europe, and they


323
0:16:5,14 --> 0:16:7,8
weren't even getting paid.


324
0:16:7,8 --> 0:16:8,95
And if they wanted
to get paid, they


325
0:16:8,95 --> 0:16:10,2
had to move to America.


326
0:16:10,2 --> 0:16:12,62



327
0:16:12,62 --> 0:16:15,57
Nowadays, you can be pro
and live in Europe.


328
0:16:15,57 --> 0:16:19,24
Before, it was impossible.


329
0:16:19,24 --> 0:16:22,27
SEB CURTIS: I was driving back
to Scotland with my folks, and


330
0:16:22,27 --> 0:16:24,48
I bought a couple of magazines
just for the


331
0:16:24,48 --> 0:16:26,89
road back in the car.


332
0:16:26,89 --> 0:16:30,94
And I remember, I think it
probably was about '96, and I


333
0:16:30,94 --> 0:16:32,62
didn't really know anything
about French


334
0:16:32,62 --> 0:16:33,52
skateboarding at that time.


335
0:16:33,52 --> 0:16:36,193
And I was just looking through
this French magazine--


336
0:16:36,193 --> 0:16:39,61
it was like, I thought this guy
was fucking killing it.


337
0:16:39,61 --> 0:16:42,18
And it was Jeremie that was
doing a frontside lipslide


338
0:16:42,18 --> 0:16:43,85
down a handrail or something
like that.


339
0:16:43,85 --> 0:16:48,3
And I think the actual interview
in it was, if I


340
0:16:48,3 --> 0:16:51,19
remember correctly, he was going
on about how he didn't


341
0:16:51,19 --> 0:16:52,52
want to move to the States.


342
0:16:52,52 --> 0:16:54,78
And he was going on about how
many rippers there are in


343
0:16:54,78 --> 0:16:57,58
France, and you can
still do it here.


344
0:16:57,58 --> 0:16:59,7
And he was even saying
it then.


345
0:16:59,7 --> 0:17:1,92
If you ask the older dudes that
kind of stopped skating


346
0:17:1,92 --> 0:17:5,21
now, used to skate back in the
day, all the stories, like,


347
0:17:5,21 --> 0:17:6,2
Jeremie did this.


348
0:17:6,2 --> 0:17:7,77
Jeremie did that.


349
0:17:7,77 --> 0:17:9,1
Way back in the day.


350
0:17:9,1 --> 0:17:11,359
The shit he's done is
pretty ridiculous.


351
0:17:11,359 --> 0:17:13,369
It definitely played a
big part in European


352
0:17:13,369 --> 0:17:14,619
skateboarding.


353
0:17:14,619 --> 0:17:20,649



354
0:17:20,649 --> 0:17:24,6



355
0:17:24,6 --> 0:17:25,78
JEREMIE DACLIN: Foch.


356
0:17:25,78 --> 0:17:32,22
Because it's the train station
stop, and it's where we are.


357
0:17:32,22 --> 0:17:34,52
-How far is it from
the Hotel de Vile?


358
0:17:34,52 --> 0:17:37,506
JEREMIE DACLIN: It's across
the bridge from the river.


359
0:17:37,506 --> 0:17:40,7
-Who's the first person
to skate this spot?


360
0:17:40,7 --> 0:17:42,79
JEREMIE DACLIN: I
think it was me.


361
0:17:42,79 --> 0:17:44,28
First I did ollie [INAUDIBLE]


362
0:17:44,28 --> 0:17:46,85
on it, and then 50/50 on it.


363
0:17:46,85 --> 0:17:49,11
-When's the last time
you skated here?


364
0:17:49,11 --> 0:17:51,87



365
0:17:51,87 --> 0:17:53,54
JEREMIE DACLIN: I mean,
really skated?


366
0:17:53,54 --> 0:17:54,82
A long time ago.


367
0:17:54,82 --> 0:17:58,19
But I come here every day to
skate the mini ramp, because


368
0:17:58,19 --> 0:17:59,26
there's also a mini ramp.


369
0:17:59,26 --> 0:18:1,87
And every time there's some
skaters who are coming to Lyon


370
0:18:1,87 --> 0:18:4,324
they want to see it.


371
0:18:4,324 --> 0:18:7,6



372
0:18:7,6 --> 0:18:10,73
JEREMIE DACLIN: I really want
to see a lipslide on it, but


373
0:18:10,73 --> 0:18:14,4
you need to be goofy
foot to do it.


374
0:18:14,4 --> 0:18:16,0
And yeah.


375
0:18:16,0 --> 0:18:19,29



376
0:18:19,29 --> 0:18:23,14
JEREMIE DACLIN: There's one, but
you'll see it in the next


377
0:18:23,14 --> 0:18:24,823
Cliche video.


378
0:18:24,823 --> 0:18:44,1



379
0:18:44,1 --> 0:18:46,38
HUGO LIARD: We are here
at the mini ramp.


380
0:18:46,38 --> 0:18:47,48
It's our mini ramp.


381
0:18:47,48 --> 0:18:48,73
We built it.


382
0:18:48,73 --> 0:18:51,195



383
0:18:51,195 --> 0:18:53,93
Really famous, because actually,
it was the first


384
0:18:53,93 --> 0:18:58,25
place of the film "Lumiere."
They start the cinema--


385
0:18:58,25 --> 0:18:59,19
the movie.


386
0:18:59,19 --> 0:19:0,13
It was here.


387
0:19:0,13 --> 0:19:4,65
They filmed the door
in front of there.


388
0:19:4,65 --> 0:19:8,88
People come and squat, they
start to build some places,


389
0:19:8,88 --> 0:19:12,24
and start to do some
art stuff.


390
0:19:12,24 --> 0:19:16,28
And then we come, and we start
to do some skate stuff.


391
0:19:16,28 --> 0:19:20,5



392
0:19:20,5 --> 0:19:21,365
I am living here.


393
0:19:21,365 --> 0:19:23,39
I built my house here.


394
0:19:23,39 --> 0:19:27,31
We tried to build something
different.


395
0:19:27,31 --> 0:19:30,42
Until the wall fall, we're
gonna stay here.


396
0:19:30,42 --> 0:19:31,21
JULIEN "JU JU" BACHELIER:
Welcome to


397
0:19:31,21 --> 0:19:33,2
Hugo's place and Vincent.


398
0:19:33,2 --> 0:19:45,82



399
0:19:45,82 --> 0:19:46,57
HUGO LIARD: So yeah.


400
0:19:46,57 --> 0:19:48,35
This guy here, Vincent,
this guy.


401
0:19:48,35 --> 0:19:53,46



402
0:19:53,46 --> 0:19:55,935
Everywhere here, they're
playing music.


403
0:19:55,935 --> 0:20:0,97
They built the house six years
ago, and then after, one year


404
0:20:0,97 --> 0:20:2,51
ago, I came here, and
said yeah, it's


405
0:20:2,51 --> 0:20:3,897
possible to build it.


406
0:20:3,897 --> 0:20:7,72
So I built it.


407
0:20:7,72 --> 0:20:8,2
It's perfect.


408
0:20:8,2 --> 0:20:11,245
And I have internet,
and a kitchen.


409
0:20:11,245 --> 0:20:12,73
Perfect.

0:20:14,71 --> 0:20:23,62



412
0:20:23,62 --> 0:20:25,15
HUGO LIARD: You can go inside.


413
0:20:25,15 --> 0:20:26,67
-What's inside?


414
0:20:26,67 --> 0:20:28,18
HUGO LIARD: It's my house.


415
0:20:28,18 --> 0:20:29,23
I built all this.


416
0:20:29,23 --> 0:20:33,34
There was nothing, and then my
friend was living here, he


417
0:20:33,34 --> 0:20:35,67
tells me one night,
yeah, maybe it's


418
0:20:35,67 --> 0:20:37,99
possible to build something.


419
0:20:37,99 --> 0:20:39,6
It's possible to make it.


420
0:20:39,6 --> 0:20:40,65
I was like, yeah.


421
0:20:40,65 --> 0:20:43,55
Check the wood, check this
carpet, you know?


422
0:20:43,55 --> 0:20:45,56
There's enough to
do something.


423
0:20:45,56 --> 0:20:49,88
Every night, six months, I built
everything, and now I'm


424
0:20:49,88 --> 0:20:52,75
living here.


425
0:20:52,75 --> 0:20:57,567
It's all the stuff I have, and
the stuff I bring here.


426
0:20:57,567 --> 0:21:0,52
So I was like, start to
put everything here.


427
0:21:0,52 --> 0:21:1,55
[INAUDIBLE].


428
0:21:1,55 --> 0:21:2,93

I have with me.

HUGO LIARD: No, that's the
first American board


431
0:21:7,81 --> 0:21:10,622
I saw in the shop.


432
0:21:10,622 --> 0:21:11,74
-[SPEAKING FRENCH]


433
0:21:11,74 --> 0:21:13,44
HUGO LIARD: In a sport shop--


434
0:21:13,44 --> 0:21:15,39
I'm like, this is an American
skateboard.


435
0:21:15,39 --> 0:21:23,99



436
0:21:23,99 --> 0:21:26,98
At the beginning, we just made
some t-shirts with a marker,


437
0:21:26,98 --> 0:21:30,19
like erase the logo, and
on it, like, fuck, it's


438
0:21:30,19 --> 0:21:31,58
our logo, you know?


439
0:21:31,58 --> 0:21:35,34
Like, fuck, we put the logo on
the other logo, and that's it.


440
0:21:35,34 --> 0:21:37,28
Wow, it's a crew.


441
0:21:37,28 --> 0:21:40,31
A lot of skateboarders do
it-- oh, it's my crew.


442
0:21:40,31 --> 0:21:44,14
So we started a crew, and
just made 50 t-shirts,


443
0:21:44,14 --> 0:21:46,8
and then 100 boards.


444
0:21:46,8 --> 0:21:48,97
And next year, it was like,
wow, we sell it?


445
0:21:48,97 --> 0:21:51,58
OK, maybe we do 200 this year.


446
0:21:51,58 --> 0:21:52,96
We will see.


447
0:21:52,96 --> 0:21:55,34
JULIAN DYKMANS: Yeah, the
company wasn't even existing.


448
0:21:55,34 --> 0:21:56,14
It wasn't official.


449
0:21:56,14 --> 0:21:58,22
We just put some money.


450
0:21:58,22 --> 0:22:1,81
It wasn't an official company,
so it's all black market.


451
0:22:1,81 --> 0:22:4,74
HUGO LIARD: For three years.


452
0:22:4,74 --> 0:22:5,92
JULIAN DYKMANS: We just
wanted to do our own


453
0:22:5,92 --> 0:22:8,14
thing, and we had all--


454
0:22:8,14 --> 0:22:12,56
I was riding for Consolidated,
and he was riding for, was it


455
0:22:12,56 --> 0:22:13,51
[INAUDIBLE]


456
0:22:13,51 --> 0:22:14,93
at that point?


457
0:22:14,93 --> 0:22:17,85
Kind of the European guys
on the American brands.


458
0:22:17,85 --> 0:22:21,93
You would go, show up, and
skate, and nobody was around,


459
0:22:21,93 --> 0:22:24,22
and everybody had their
own problems.


460
0:22:24,22 --> 0:22:26,25
You don't even know why you're
going there and stuff.


461
0:22:26,25 --> 0:22:28,79
And you're from Europe, and then
you're just like, well,


462
0:22:28,79 --> 0:22:32,4
actually, we can do our little
own thing, and it's more fun,


463
0:22:32,4 --> 0:22:33,12
because it's your thing.


464
0:22:33,12 --> 0:22:35,67
HUGO LIARD: That's a good
contrast with Cliche.


465
0:22:35,67 --> 0:22:37,745
For me I used to come here and
skate a lot with the Cliche


466
0:22:37,745 --> 0:22:40,14
guy, because they were the only
ones who really moved


467
0:22:40,14 --> 0:22:41,43
their ass for skate--


468
0:22:41,43 --> 0:22:44,77
like move, travel, in
a van, cut some


469
0:22:44,77 --> 0:22:48,25
fence, and skate something.


470
0:22:48,25 --> 0:22:52,82
But the style was different,
so kids were like, I don't


471
0:22:52,82 --> 0:22:54,34
know-- rock and roll,
all of this.


472
0:22:54,34 --> 0:22:57,8
Some kids were happy to see
something different.


473
0:22:57,8 --> 0:23:2,6
And from the beginning,
it was just, fuck it.


474
0:23:2,6 --> 0:23:3,61
Fuck everything.


475
0:23:3,61 --> 0:23:4,85
Fuck all the company.


476
0:23:4,85 --> 0:23:7,16
Fuck the consuming stuff.


477
0:23:7,16 --> 0:23:9,11
And at the end, we're in
the business world.


478
0:23:9,11 --> 0:23:15,47
And we try to keep the spirit we
had at the beginning, too.


479
0:23:15,47 --> 0:23:19,99



480
0:23:19,99 --> 0:23:23,1
JULIAN DYKMANS: No,
it's not hard.


481
0:23:23,1 --> 0:23:25,61
It somehow comes naturally,
I guess.


482
0:23:25,61 --> 0:23:28,73
You always crash test those guys
on the tour, and it fits


483
0:23:28,73 --> 0:23:31,2
perfectly or it doesn't
at all, actually.


484
0:23:31,2 --> 0:23:31,72
JULIEN "JU JU" BACHELIER:
Much more than


485
0:23:31,72 --> 0:23:33,49
money, it's like a family.


486
0:23:33,49 --> 0:23:36,16
All people get involved
in [INAUDIBLE]


487
0:23:36,16 --> 0:23:39,6
is like, just friendship.


488
0:23:39,6 --> 0:23:41,73
And the thing is, we go on the
road with a backpack with the


489
0:23:41,73 --> 0:23:45,59
boards, and we just enjoy,
and try to skate, try


490
0:23:45,59 --> 0:23:47,74
to have a good time.


491
0:23:47,74 --> 0:23:49,653

treasure you can have

0:23:49,653 --> 0:23:50,34

SAM PARTAIX: I skate for Antiz
since maybe four years right


497
0:24:0,3 --> 0:24:4,5
now, and that's really,
really good.


498
0:24:4,5 --> 0:24:9,97
Because for me, when I was a kid
I was dreaming when I saw


499
0:24:9,97 --> 0:24:14,72
Hugo and Ju Ju on the magazine,
I was all, crazy


500
0:24:14,72 --> 0:24:15,41
skateboarder.


501
0:24:15,41 --> 0:24:19,77
A photographer called me and he
just said, you have to come


502
0:24:19,77 --> 0:24:22,6
with me, skate a bit in Lyon.


503
0:24:22,6 --> 0:24:27,37
And I met this guy, and it was
really, really fun and good.


504
0:24:27,37 --> 0:24:30,6
And they told me, yeah, if you
want, skate for Antiz.


505
0:24:30,6 --> 0:24:32,14
Then I was ahh, so good.


506
0:24:32,14 --> 0:24:36,6



507
0:24:36,6 --> 0:24:38,48
So [INAUDIBLE] you can
not go inside.


508
0:24:38,48 --> 0:24:40,2
It's private.


509
0:24:40,2 --> 0:24:41,42
-What's going on in there?


510
0:24:41,42 --> 0:24:41,755
SAM PARTAIX: Huh?


511
0:24:41,755 --> 0:24:43,59
-What's going on inside?


512
0:24:43,59 --> 0:24:48,92
SAM PARTAIX: Skating, cheating,
enjoying life.

ALEXIS JAUZION: I was in
Marseille, south east France


521
0:26:43,66 --> 0:26:46,7
the first big bowl
we got in France.


522
0:26:46,7 --> 0:26:48,9
It's famous pretty much because
of the bowl riders


523
0:26:48,9 --> 0:26:51,77
contest that Quicksilver
organized a few


524
0:26:51,77 --> 0:26:53,6
years ago for us.


525
0:26:53,6 --> 0:26:56,1
It's a real historical place,
compared to what has been


526
0:26:56,1 --> 0:26:57,75
done, which legends
of skateboarding


527
0:26:57,75 --> 0:26:59,54
have skated that spot.


528
0:26:59,54 --> 0:27:4,16
US pros used to come more in
Europe, because there was


529
0:27:4,16 --> 0:27:7,78
still a lot of World Cups
taking place in Europe.


530
0:27:7,78 --> 0:27:10,43
So they came along to promote
their brands and stuff.


531
0:27:10,43 --> 0:27:14,44
And most of the time, when they
were in France, they were


532
0:27:14,44 --> 0:27:18,29
always managing to get two or
three or four free days for


533
0:27:18,29 --> 0:27:19,16
just checking Marseilles.


534
0:27:19,16 --> 0:27:23,3
So there's a list
of crazy names--


535
0:27:23,3 --> 0:27:25,38
like, really good names
of skateboarding


536
0:27:25,38 --> 0:27:26,42
that have skated here.


537
0:27:26,42 --> 0:27:29,11
The incredible transfer of John
Cardiel with a broken


538
0:27:29,11 --> 0:27:30,26
board, backside 360.


539
0:27:30,26 --> 0:27:32,91
Still the craziest trick
that has ever been


540
0:27:32,91 --> 0:27:34,1
done in this spot.


541
0:27:34,1 --> 0:27:37,48
Omar Hassan is the only one for
the moment I've seen doing


542
0:27:37,48 --> 0:27:39,19
McTwist in the big bowl.


543
0:27:39,19 --> 0:27:42,93
But after that, years after
years, the local skaters that


544
0:27:42,93 --> 0:27:46,4
were also entering the bowl
riders, they knew how to take


545
0:27:46,4 --> 0:27:49,2
the lines, and which kind
of transfer they can do.


546
0:27:49,2 --> 0:27:50,64
It's kind of perfect.


547
0:27:50,64 --> 0:27:55,63
What people designed
almost 20 years ago


548
0:27:55,63 --> 0:27:57,275
is still real skateable.


549
0:27:57,275 --> 0:28:2,85



550
0:28:2,85 --> 0:28:5,56
MAT BEGUE: When they did all the
metro stuff in Marseille


551
0:28:5,56 --> 0:28:9,23
in 1991, all the ground they
took out from the town, they


552
0:28:9,23 --> 0:28:11,19
used it to make all these
beaches you see here.


553
0:28:11,19 --> 0:28:14,45
Before, the sea was against
the street.


554
0:28:14,45 --> 0:28:16,98
So they decided to build
a Californian


555
0:28:16,98 --> 0:28:19,29
way of life, seashore.


556
0:28:19,29 --> 0:28:22,1
And we had the luck to have Jean
Pierre Collinet, who is


557
0:28:22,1 --> 0:28:23,1
the architect of the bowl.


558
0:28:23,1 --> 0:28:25,75
And he was a passionate
skateboarder, and 100%


559
0:28:25,75 --> 0:28:29,16
skateboarder, and he
helped having this.


560
0:28:29,16 --> 0:28:31,58
There has always been skating
in Marseilles, but the bowl


561
0:28:31,58 --> 0:28:32,83
really connected people.
