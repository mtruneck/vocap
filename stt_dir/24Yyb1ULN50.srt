CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: That was seriously
one of the best I-reports segments I`ve ever


5
0:0:36,429 --> 0:0:41,37
seen, so big thanks to the Coronado Quartet
for an awesome introduction on this Friday.


6
0:0:41,37 --> 0:0:46,109
I`m Carl Azuz, we`ve got a lot to talk about
today: current events, cultural events, even


7
0:0:46,109 --> 0:0:51,139
a couture event. We are starting with a political
crisis.


8
0:0:51,139 --> 0:0:55,239
A leader who says he`s doing what`s best for
his country. Some of his people accusing him


9
0:0:55,239 --> 0:1:0,329
of having too much power. The streets filled
with protests and violence. It`s happening


10
0:1:0,329 --> 0:1:5,61
in the country that`s seen this before, in
fact, less than two years ago - Egypt. This


11
0:1:5,61 --> 0:1:11,2
was the scene in Cairo on Tuesday. People
who support President Mohamed Morsi and people


12
0:1:11,2 --> 0:1:15,869
who are against him fighting right outside
the presidential palace. At least six people


13
0:1:15,869 --> 0:1:22,13
were killed, more than 670 were wounded. In
a speech yesterday, President Morsi spoke


14
0:1:22,13 --> 0:1:27,18
out against the violence and said that people
responsible will be punished. Military tanks


15
0:1:27,18 --> 0:1:32,96
in the streets of Cairo are just one sign
the tension is not going away.


16
0:1:32,96 --> 0:1:37,2
Next up, we are moving to Asia and focusing
on North Korea. The country says that sometime


17
0:1:37,2 --> 0:1:43,9
between December 10th and 22nd, it`s planning
to launch a rocket. But the North Korean government


18
0:1:43,9 --> 0:1:48,619
claims that the rocket is for science and
research purposes. The thing is, if this launch


19
0:1:48,619 --> 0:1:53,32
happens, it would involve the same technology
that would be used to launch a ballistic missile.


20
0:1:53,32 --> 0:1:58,6
It would also violate a pair of resolutions
from the U.N. Security Council. The U.S. has


21
0:1:58,6 --> 0:2:2,749
spoken out against this launch plan, it`s
also keeping an eye on it. Experts say this


22
0:2:2,749 --> 0:2:7,9
satellite image shows increased activity at
the North Korean launch pad.


23
0:2:7,9 --> 0:2:12,41
Let`s bring it back to the U.S and head to
Washington D.C. President Obama and U.S. House


24
0:2:12,41 --> 0:2:17,22
Speaker John Boehner talked on the phone Wednesday.
If you`ve been watching our show, you probably


25
0:2:17,22 --> 0:2:21,97
know what they were talking about -- the fiscal
cliff. Negotiations about this cliff and any


26
0:2:21,97 --> 0:2:27,83
deal to avoid it involve two main things:
taxes and government spending. Today, Jessica


27
0:2:27,83 --> 0:2:31,83
Yellin looks at one of those and compares
the plans from the two sides in the debate.


28

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


29
0:2:32,19 --> 0:2:36,37
JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: In the
New Year, taxes go up on everyone, unless


30
0:2:36,37 --> 0:2:42,29
Washington takes action. But the government
needs more money. President Obama wants to


31
0:2:42,29 --> 0:2:48,23
get some of it from the top two percent of
wage earners. He wants to raise their tax


32
0:2:48,23 --> 0:2:55,87
rate and limit how much they can deduct. The
White House says this will bring in $1.6 trillion


33
0:2:55,87 --> 0:3:1,51
over ten years. Republicans say they`ll agree
to bring in more money, but not by raising


34
0:3:1,51 --> 0:3:8,13
tax rates, in fact they want to lower tax
rates for everyone. Instead, they raise money


35
0:3:8,13 --> 0:3:15,1
only by limiting deductions and closing loopholes.
Speaker Boehner says, this will raise $800


36
0:3:15,1 --> 0:3:17,2
billion over ten years.

classes at Richard Ira Jones Middle School
in Plainfield, Illinois.


41
0:3:28,98 --> 0:3:34,98
What city is the headquarters of the U.S.
Navy`s Pacific Fleet? Here we go, is it San


42
0:3:34,98 --> 0:3:42,3
Diego, California, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, San
Francisco, California or Norfolk, Virginia?


43
0:3:42,3 --> 0:3:46,81
You`ve got three seconds, go!


44
0:3:46,81 --> 0:3:55,48
Pearl Harbor has been the U.S. Pacific`s Fleet
headquarters since February 1941. That`s your


45
0:3:55,48 --> 0:3:58,71
answer and that`s your "Shoutout."

AZUZ: Today, the Pacific Fleet includes 180
ships, nearly 2,000 aircraft and 140,000 sailors


48
0:4:8,23 --> 0:4:13,62
and civilians. It wasn`t quite that big in
1941, but the potential military might of


49
0:4:13,62 --> 0:4:18,38
the U.S. Pacific Fleet led to what happened
71 years ago today.

AZUZ: President Franklin Roosevelt talking
about the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl


54
0:4:34,85 --> 0:4:42,6
Harbor, more than 2400 Americans were killed,
more than 1100 others wounded, more than 300


55
0:4:42,6 --> 0:4:48,84
air crafts destroyed or damaged, 21 ships
were sunk or damaged. The attack struck a


56
0:4:48,84 --> 0:4:54,86
serious blow to the Pacific fleet, which was
Japan`s goal. It also led the U.S to officially


57
0:4:54,86 --> 0:4:57,48
enter World War II the very next day.


58
0:4:57,48 --> 0:5:2,43
Aimee Copeland, you may remember hearing that
name. In May, the 24- year old contracted


59
0:5:2,43 --> 0:5:8,1
a deadly flesh-eating disease. Doctors gave
her a one percent chance of survival. Seven


60
0:5:8,1 --> 0:5:12,47
months later Amy is out of the hospital, living
at home and planning to go back to school


61
0:5:12,47 --> 0:5:17,97
and finish up her master`s degree. The disease
has taken its tall: doctors had to amputate


62
0:5:17,97 --> 0:5:23,43
both of Amy`s hands, her feet and one of her
legs. She has prosthetic limbs and uses an


63
0:5:23,43 --> 0:5:27,49
automated wheelchair now. She talked with
CNN this week about some of the struggles


64
0:5:27,49 --> 0:5:28,93
she`s faces through all of this.

AIMEE COPELAND, FLESH-EATING DISEASE SURVIVOR:
I have really hard moments, definitely. When


67
0:5:33,4 --> 0:5:38,71
things aren`t, you know, going right or if
a lot of times I`m by myself, I can`t do something,


68
0:5:38,71 --> 0:5:43,9
I can`t get to something. And I think it`s
really necessary to fully experience those


69
0:5:43,9 --> 0:5:51,28
moments of grief, of just absolute exhaustion,
and, you know, to experience them, allow to


70
0:5:51,28 --> 0:5:57,33
accept them, allow them to pass, and over
the horizon there`s always more sunshine and


71
0:5:57,33 --> 0:6:2,36
more love, so you know, even in those dark,
dark nights of the soul, you know, we wake


72
0:6:2,36 --> 0:6:8,22
up and it`s spring. So, I definitely am learning
as much as possible from those moments and,


73
0:6:8,22 --> 0:6:11,52
you know, trying to heal, slowly but surely.


74
0:6:11,52 --> 0:6:12,81

AZUZ: Absolutely amazing story, and absolutely
amazing person. All right, we want you to


76
0:6:16,81 --> 0:6:21,3
think back for this next story today. What
was the coolest thing you ever brought to


77
0:6:21,3 --> 0:6:26,22
school for show and tell? It doesn`t matter.
A seventh grader in Minnesota has you beat.


78
0:6:26,22 --> 0:6:30,69
She showed up with Minnesota Viking starting
quarterback Christian Ponder as part of a


79
0:6:30,69 --> 0:6:35,33
contest she won. Ponder certainly seem to
have a good time, and he had some advice for


80
0:6:35,33 --> 0:6:35,77
the students.

CHRISTIAN PONDER, VIKINGS QUARTERBACK: That
was like the coolest introduction I`ve ever


83
0:6:39,49 --> 0:6:43,27
had in my life going through that longest
line of people ever. Looking back on this,


84
0:6:43,27 --> 0:6:48,44
you know, seventh grade, how so important
that I thought I fit in, but who cares? What


85
0:6:48,44 --> 0:6:51,699
is someone else thinking about you is not
going to determine how your life goes.

88
0:6:53,41 --> 0:6:58,8
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s time for a "Shoutout"
extra credit. The Maccabees are involved in


89
0:6:58,8 --> 0:7:5,2
the history of what world religion? You know
what to do, is it Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism


90
0:7:5,2 --> 0:7:15,9
or Daoism. Rewind that clock to three seconds
and go!


91
0:7:15,9 --> 0:7:20,639
In Judaism, the Maccabees are central to the
story of Hanukkah. That`s your answer and


92
0:7:20,639 --> 0:7:23,11
that`s your "Shoutout" extra credit.


93
0:7:23,11 --> 0:7:24,699
(END VIDEO CLIP)


94
0:7:24,699 --> 0:7:31,78
AZUZ: Well, here is how that story goes: around
165 B.C. The Maccabees led a revolution against


95
0:7:31,78 --> 0:7:37,4
Syrians who were oppressing the Jewish people.
Now after their victory, the Maccabees rededicated


96
0:7:37,4 --> 0:7:40,74
the main temple in Jerusalem, and there`s
a light in the temple that`s supposed to be


97
0:7:40,74 --> 0:7:45,65
lit all the time. Now, according to the story,
there was only enough oil for one night, but


98
0:7:45,65 --> 0:7:51,4
the oil lasted for eight days. That`s why
Hanukkah lasts for eight days, and why the


99
0:7:51,4 --> 0:7:55,32
Hanukkah menorah includes eight candles plus
one that lights them. This was a National


100
0:7:55,32 --> 0:7:59,57
Menorah lighting from a couple of years ago.
This year, Hanukkah starts on Saturday night


101
0:7:59,57 --> 0:8:3,88
and it runs until sunset on the following
Sunday. The word Hanukkah means dedication,


102
0:8:3,88 --> 0:8:8,55
and the holiday is sometimes known as the
Feast of Dedication, the Festival of Lights,


103
0:8:8,55 --> 0:8:12,87
or the Feast of the Maccabees.


104
0:8:12,87 --> 0:8:18,57
We all know someone with a bad holiday sweater.
Some have reindeer on them, some have other


105
0:8:18,57 --> 0:8:23,919
things, like this gem I got as a Christmas
gift last year and wore just long enough to


106
0:8:23,919 --> 0:8:29,43
get the photograph taken. I`m sorry, Bab (ph)
it`s ugly. It didn`t come from 18-year old


107
0:8:29,43 --> 0:8:34,279
Jack McCarthy, but a lot of people have done
their sartorially unsavory sweater shopping


108
0:8:34,279 --> 0:8:38,999
with him. He`s kneaded up a stockpile from
trips to flea markets, thrift stores and yard


109
0:8:38,999 --> 0:8:43,709
sales. If there`s anything pretty about this,
it`s the pretty big money they`ve made Jack.


110
0:8:43,709 --> 0:8:47,519
And that may be why he doesn`t think they
are ugly in the traditional sense.


111

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


112
0:8:48,649 --> 0:8:53,559
JACK MCCARTHY: The more colorful, the more
- the more action, the more eyepopping things,


113
0:8:53,559 --> 0:8:55,29
that`s our definition of ugly.


114
0:8:55,29 --> 0:8:55,92
(END VIDEO CLIP)


115
0:8:55,92 --> 0:8:59,85
AZUZ: Well, at least now we all know what
to ask Santa for. And when you think of doing


116
0:8:59,85 --> 0:9:4,85
that, visiting Santa, you might picture a
line of crying kids at a shopping mall. Well,


117
0:9:4,85 --> 0:9:8,809
they were lining up here all right, but not
to sit on Santa`s lap, at least not without


118
0:9:8,809 --> 0:9:14,3
a wet suit. Forget a clatter on the roof -- this
scuba center stunt is making a splash under


119
0:9:14,3 --> 0:9:19,379
the waves in Texas. He needs a waterproof
list to check twice, and a tank full of oxygen


120
0:9:19,379 --> 0:9:23,869
to keep those cheeks rosy. After all, nobody
wants a blue Christmas. And while some sea


121
0:9:23,869 --> 0:11:23,869
Scrooges might say, scoo-bah humbug, I have
to admit, I laughed 
when I saw him, in spite of myself.
