1
0:0:1,67 --> 0:0:2,168
Jesse Green: On this
episode of American Chainsaw.


2
0:0:2,168 --> 0:0:3,502
Where do you
suppose Fred is?


3
0:0:3,502 --> 0:0:4,47
Jay Green: What
the (bleep).


4
0:0:4,47 --> 0:0:5,504
That's not my job.


5
0:0:5,504 --> 0:0:8,441
Jesse Green: No dude
that's the tent.


6
0:0:8,441 --> 0:0:11,444
Brett set me up
for disaster.


7
0:0:11,444 --> 0:0:12,411
I'm hit.


8
0:0:12,411 --> 0:0:13,813
That doesn't make
it any easier.


9
0:0:13,813 --> 0:0:14,947
Man: I think I'm
going to be calling


10
0:0:14,947 --> 0:0:16,82
the cops right now.


11
0:0:16,82 --> 0:0:17,16
Jesse Green: Why?


12
0:0:17,16 --> 0:0:21,62
Man: And have
you shut down.


13
0:0:21,62 --> 0:0:23,923
Jesse Green: I am the
machine Jesse Green.


14
0:0:23,923 --> 0:0:26,392
A couple of years ago, I
walked away from my job as


15
0:0:26,392 --> 0:0:28,961
a truck driver to chase
my dream of owning my own


16
0:0:28,961 --> 0:0:30,996
business as a master
chainsaw sculptor.


17
0:0:30,996 --> 0:0:32,731
I took a huge
risk in doing it,


18
0:0:32,731 --> 0:0:34,9
but the rewards of being
my own boss and doing


19
0:0:34,9 --> 0:0:37,97
exactly what I want
are so worth it to me.


20
0:0:37,97 --> 0:0:40,172
My employees,
including my own dad,


21
0:0:40,172 --> 0:0:41,507
drive me crazy.


22
0:0:41,507 --> 0:0:43,742
Get back.


23
0:0:43,742 --> 0:0:45,544
But I can't
do this alone.


24
0:0:45,544 --> 0:0:47,213
I'm living my dream
and I wouldn't have it


25
0:0:47,213 --> 0:1:1,994
any other way.


26
0:1:1,994 --> 0:1:2,928
Beth Green: Looks good.


27
0:1:2,928 --> 0:1:3,829
Jesse Green: Thank you.


28
0:1:3,829 --> 0:1:4,83
Beth Green: It looks
good enough that


29
0:1:4,83 --> 0:1:5,764
maybe we can
take a break.


30
0:1:5,764 --> 0:1:6,732
Jesse Green:
What do you got?


31
0:1:6,732 --> 0:1:7,8
Beth Green: I got a
call from a couple


32
0:1:7,8 --> 0:1:9,268
on Holliston, they got
a big huge stump and


33
0:1:9,268 --> 0:1:10,636
they want you
to check it out.


34
0:1:10,636 --> 0:1:12,204
Jesse Green: I still got
to finish up the goat.


35
0:1:12,204 --> 0:1:13,706
Beth Green: Let Missy
and Keith handle that.


36
0:1:13,706 --> 0:1:15,541
I just need you to
learn how to delegate.


37
0:1:15,541 --> 0:1:17,42
In order to
make this business more


38
0:1:17,42 --> 0:1:19,545
profitable I have to
keep Jesse on a schedule


39
0:1:19,545 --> 0:1:21,747
and he really needs
to focus on carving.


40
0:1:21,747 --> 0:1:23,883
All the details and things
can be done by Brett and


41
0:1:23,883 --> 0:1:25,751
Keith and Missy and
we could turn these


42
0:1:25,751 --> 0:1:27,52
over so much quicker.


43
0:1:27,52 --> 0:1:28,587
Big stump, big money.


44
0:1:28,587 --> 0:1:29,522
Can you get over
there today?


45
0:1:29,522 --> 0:1:30,256
Jesse Green: Yah.


46
0:1:30,256 --> 0:1:30,956
Beth Green: Yah?


47
0:1:30,956 --> 0:1:31,724
Jesse Green: Yah.


48
0:1:31,724 --> 0:1:32,791
Beth Green: Alright good.


49
0:1:32,791 --> 0:1:34,393
Jesse Green: I prefer to
do one project at a time.


50
0:1:34,393 --> 0:1:35,661
But we're a growing
business and


51
0:1:35,661 --> 0:1:37,93
so I say I can't afford
to turn down work.


52
0:1:37,93 --> 0:1:39,198
Jay Green: Back, back.


53
0:1:39,198 --> 0:1:40,833
Jesse Green: So we're
going to load up the van


54
0:1:40,833 --> 0:1:42,67
and go meet a
potential new client.


55
0:1:42,67 --> 0:1:43,235
Jay Green: I'm
not moving this.


56
0:1:43,235 --> 0:1:44,503
It's shut.


57
0:1:44,503 --> 0:1:46,305
Jesse Green: I'm not
paying attention to you.


58
0:1:46,305 --> 0:1:47,439
I have a marker.


59
0:1:47,439 --> 0:1:48,874
Jay Green: I thought you
said you were watching me.


60
0:1:48,874 --> 0:1:50,142
Jesse Green: I'm watching
you so you get the (bleep)


61
0:1:50,142 --> 0:1:51,31
out of the way and
be safe about it.


62
0:1:51,31 --> 0:1:52,545
Jay Green: I'm
out of the way.


63
0:1:52,545 --> 0:1:53,646
Jesse Green: You're
like right on top


64
0:1:53,646 --> 0:1:54,68
of the trailer.


65
0:1:54,68 --> 0:1:55,548
I'm going to hit the
trailer with the car.


66
0:1:55,548 --> 0:1:56,415
Jay Green: What
do you want me?


67
0:1:56,415 --> 0:1:57,616
Where do you
want me to go?


68
0:1:57,616 --> 0:1:58,951
Jesse Green: I want you to
stand away so it's safe.


69
0:1:58,951 --> 0:2:0,586
How come I have
to be safe and


70
0:2:0,586 --> 0:2:1,954
every time I tell you
to stand away from the


71
0:2:1,954 --> 0:2:3,55
trailer while I'm
hooking it up,


72
0:2:3,55 --> 0:2:4,23
you're on top
of the trailer?


73
0:2:4,23 --> 0:2:5,24
Jay Green: You love me.


74
0:2:5,24 --> 0:2:6,58
You ain't
going to hit me.


75
0:2:6,58 --> 0:2:7,326
Jesse Green: Maybe I'm
tempted to hit you?


76
0:2:7,326 --> 0:2:8,427
Jay Green: No you're not.


77
0:2:8,427 --> 0:2:9,361
Jesse Green: Like I've
never done this before.


78
0:2:9,361 --> 0:2:10,196
Jay Green: Hurry up.


79
0:2:10,196 --> 0:2:11,463
Jesse Green:
I'll admit it;


80
0:2:11,463 --> 0:2:12,898
I'm still learning
how to manage people.


81
0:2:12,898 --> 0:2:14,233
But when it comes to
managing my family


82
0:2:14,233 --> 0:2:15,768
I don't have a clue.


83
0:2:15,768 --> 0:2:17,937
My dad doesn't
listen to me.


84
0:2:17,937 --> 0:2:19,71
He always thinks
he knows better.


85
0:2:19,71 --> 0:2:20,172
Jay Green: Stop.


86
0:2:20,172 --> 0:2:21,707
You didn't stop when
I told you to stop.


87
0:2:21,707 --> 0:2:22,908
Jesse Green: It's perfect.


88
0:2:22,908 --> 0:2:24,944
Do you know what I was
doing for a living before


89
0:2:24,944 --> 0:2:26,879
we started doing
sculpting full time?


90
0:2:26,879 --> 0:2:28,614
I was a tractor
trailer driver dad.


91
0:2:28,614 --> 0:2:29,715
Jay Green: Yes I know.


92
0:2:29,715 --> 0:2:30,916
Jesse Green: So do
you know what I did


93
0:2:30,916 --> 0:2:31,984
on a daily basis?


94
0:2:31,984 --> 0:2:32,985
Jay Green: What did you
do on a daily basis?


95
0:2:32,985 --> 0:2:34,286
Jesse Green: I
hooked up trailers.


96
0:2:34,286 --> 0:2:35,654
Jay Green: Jesse has
never asked for help.


97
0:2:35,654 --> 0:2:37,189
He thinks he
knows everything,


98
0:2:37,189 --> 0:2:39,291
but in order for the
business to grow,


99
0:2:39,291 --> 0:2:41,894
Jesse has to learn
to trust the people


100
0:2:41,894 --> 0:2:42,928
who work for him.


101
0:2:42,928 --> 0:2:43,996
Jesse Green: You want
to check the lights?


102
0:2:43,996 --> 0:2:45,97
Jay Green: You going
to turn them on?


103
0:2:45,97 --> 0:2:46,365
Jesse Green: I
turned them on.


104
0:2:46,365 --> 0:2:47,433
Jay Green:
Did you really?


105
0:2:47,433 --> 0:2:48,834
Jesse Green: They're on
the flashers are on.


106
0:2:48,834 --> 0:2:49,768
Jay Green: Did
you plug them in?


107
0:2:49,768 --> 0:2:50,903
Jesse Green: No.


108
0:2:50,903 --> 0:2:52,404
Jay Green: Well
plug them in.


109
0:2:52,404 --> 0:2:54,807
I told you he should
always listen to me.


110
0:2:54,807 --> 0:2:55,741
You want the shovel?


111
0:2:55,741 --> 0:2:56,942
Jesse Green: Yes please.


112
0:2:56,942 --> 0:2:57,81
Yah give me those.


113
0:2:57,81 --> 0:2:58,644
No, no.


114
0:2:58,644 --> 0:2:59,745
Wait, wait, wait.


115
0:2:59,745 --> 0:3:1,614
Do you think that that's
going to travel safely?


116
0:3:1,614 --> 0:3:2,615
Brett: Probably not.


117
0:3:2,615 --> 0:3:3,682
No.


118
0:3:3,682 --> 0:3:5,17
Jesse Green: There's more
work than I can do by


119
0:3:5,17 --> 0:3:6,352
myself, so Brett's
supposed to help me.


120
0:3:6,352 --> 0:3:8,187
Please pull big blue out
of the (bleep) oil please.


121
0:3:8,187 --> 0:3:9,221
Brett: What?


122
0:3:9,221 --> 0:3:10,322
Jesse Green: The problem
is Brett is (bleep)


123
0:3:10,322 --> 0:3:11,257
helping me.


124
0:3:11,257 --> 0:3:12,558
No dude,
that's the tent.


125
0:3:12,558 --> 0:3:13,559
Brett: Okay.


126
0:3:13,559 --> 0:3:14,693
Jesse Green: That's
the nice white tent.


127
0:3:14,693 --> 0:3:16,28
If there was two of
me, or three of me,


128
0:3:16,28 --> 0:3:17,396
I could load
everything myself.


129
0:3:17,396 --> 0:3:18,631
It would be
done perfect.


130
0:3:18,631 --> 0:3:19,898
But I have to rely
on other people.


131
0:3:19,898 --> 0:3:21,767
Uh, can you
hand me cones.


132
0:3:21,767 --> 0:3:22,701
Keith:<i> (grunts).</i>


133
0:3:22,701 --> 0:3:24,3
Jesse Green: Wow dude,
look at you man.


134
0:3:24,3 --> 0:3:25,4
See Brett.


135
0:3:25,4 --> 0:3:27,239
Do you see how a
real man works?


136
0:3:27,239 --> 0:3:28,34
Keith: Yah, that's it.


137
0:3:28,34 --> 0:3:29,475
Brett: (<i> laughing).</i>


138
0:3:29,475 --> 0:3:31,76
Jesse is the
most OCD, anal,


139
0:3:31,76 --> 0:3:33,279
micromanager
I've ever seen,


140
0:3:33,279 --> 0:3:35,8
but sometimes when you're
starting out you need to


141
0:3:35,8 --> 0:3:37,683
be micromanaged to get
where he can trust you.


142
0:3:37,683 --> 0:3:39,752
So I'm the whipping
post here at the shop.


143
0:3:39,752 --> 0:3:41,12
It's ridiculous though.


144
0:3:41,12 --> 0:3:42,54
Jesse Green: Alright.


145
0:3:42,54 --> 0:3:43,55
Let's go.


146
0:3:43,55 --> 0:3:44,356
You come with me,
you meet us there.


147
0:3:44,356 --> 0:3:45,257
Brett: Okay.


148
0:3:45,257 --> 0:3:46,191
Jesse Green: You
working on the what?


149
0:3:46,191 --> 0:3:47,393
The Navy goat?


150
0:3:47,393 --> 0:3:52,64
Keith:<i>
 (makes goat noise).</i>


151
0:3:52,64 --> 0:3:53,299
Jay Green: So why
don't you just schedule


152
0:3:53,299 --> 0:3:54,6
these things early
in the morning?


153
0:3:54,6 --> 0:3:56,302
Jesse Green: I, that's
a question for my wife.


154
0:3:56,302 --> 0:3:58,37
Jay Green: They just call
up and she said Jesse go.


155
0:3:58,37 --> 0:4:0,839
Jesse Green: Yah, I
probably could've said no.


156
0:4:0,839 --> 0:4:2,241
I mean I'm in charge.


157
0:4:2,241 --> 0:4:3,609
Jay Green: Ah,
she's your wife.


158
0:4:3,609 --> 0:4:5,77
Who's in charge?


159
0:4:5,77 --> 0:4:6,845
How are the other
sculptures doing?


160
0:4:6,845 --> 0:4:8,514
Jesse Green: Good, I
feel like I don't have


161
0:4:8,514 --> 0:4:10,49
nearly enough time
to work on anything.


162
0:4:10,49 --> 0:4:11,85
It's a tough balance
to run this business.


163
0:4:11,85 --> 0:4:14,53
On the one hand, we
have to stay on pace in


164
0:4:14,53 --> 0:4:15,521
order to keep the
money coming in.


165
0:4:15,521 --> 0:4:17,222
On the other hand,
we have to make sure


166
0:4:17,222 --> 0:4:18,624
the sculptures
are done right.


167
0:4:18,624 --> 0:4:20,592
I really feel
like everything


168
0:4:20,592 --> 0:4:21,66
is on my shoulders.


169
0:4:21,66 --> 0:4:24,263
Jay Green: I'm just,
you know, concerned.


170
0:4:24,263 --> 0:4:31,87
Jesse Green: Thank you.


171
0:4:31,87 --> 0:4:33,939
Paul: We got a big
tree that I cut down,


172
0:4:33,939 --> 0:4:36,575
so I said why don't we
leave like nine feet up


173
0:4:36,575 --> 0:4:37,743
and then we'll
call Jesse and


174
0:4:37,743 --> 0:4:38,711
see what he
can do with it.


175
0:4:38,711 --> 0:4:40,379
So we kicked around
some ideas and


176
0:4:40,379 --> 0:4:42,14
Nancy came up with
something she'd like.


177
0:4:42,14 --> 0:4:44,45
Nancy: We love squirrels,
I love squirrels.


178
0:4:44,45 --> 0:4:45,818
Jesse Green: I heard
squirrel, is that right?


179
0:4:45,818 --> 0:4:47,286
Nancy: Squirrel is right.


180
0:4:47,286 --> 0:4:49,488
Jesse Green: They want me
to carve a squirrel, sure.


181
0:4:49,488 --> 0:4:51,9
Okay, that's different.


182
0:4:51,9 --> 0:4:52,825
I'd carve
anything I guess.


183
0:4:52,825 --> 0:4:53,892
Yah awesome.


184
0:4:53,892 --> 0:4:55,728
A big squirrel, I've
never done that before.


185
0:4:55,728 --> 0:4:56,729
That sounds
pretty awesome.


186
0:4:56,729 --> 0:4:57,896
Paul: Really?


187
0:4:57,896 --> 0:5:0,132
Nancy's been feeding
them for years.


188
0:5:0,132 --> 0:5:1,5
Nancy: They're
very, very friendly;


189
0:5:1,5 --> 0:5:2,701
they eat out of your hand.


190
0:5:2,701 --> 0:5:3,902
Jesse Green: So
you guys are like


191
0:5:3,902 --> 0:5:5,104
squirrel whisperers?


192
0:5:5,104 --> 0:5:6,138
Paul:<i> (laughing).</i>


193
0:5:6,138 --> 0:5:7,606
Nancy: When Paul was
painting the barn,


194
0:5:7,606 --> 0:5:9,108
they even went
up the ladder.


195
0:5:9,108 --> 0:5:10,275
Paul: Looking
for peanuts,


196
0:5:10,275 --> 0:5:11,377
I guess I smelled
like peanuts.


197
0:5:11,377 --> 0:5:13,78
We'd go to church on
Sunday morning in the


198
0:5:13,78 --> 0:5:14,813
summertime, they'd
follow us and


199
0:5:14,813 --> 0:5:15,948
they'd jump up
in the window with


200
0:5:15,948 --> 0:5:16,949
the window open.


201
0:5:16,949 --> 0:5:18,16
Jesse Green: Come on.


202
0:5:18,16 --> 0:5:19,184
Paul: And it used to
drive the priest crazy.


203
0:5:19,184 --> 0:5:20,52
Nancy: Like one
of them went right


204
0:5:20,52 --> 0:5:20,953
down the center aisle.


205
0:5:20,953 --> 0:5:22,54
Jesse Green: I'm sorry;


206
0:5:22,54 --> 0:5:23,21
they followed you
into the church?


207
0:5:23,21 --> 0:5:23,789
Paul: Yah.


208
0:5:23,789 --> 0:5:24,59
Nancy: Yep.


209
0:5:24,59 --> 0:5:25,858
Jay Green: That's
a bit creepy.


210
0:5:25,858 --> 0:5:27,59
And kind of nuts.


211
0:5:27,59 --> 0:5:28,193
<i> (laughing).</i>


212
0:5:28,193 --> 0:5:29,428
Paul: There's
your canvas Jesse.


213
0:5:29,428 --> 0:5:30,362
Jesse Green: Wow.


214
0:5:30,362 --> 0:5:31,463
Paul: Somewhere
hiding behind that


215
0:5:31,463 --> 0:5:32,531
bark is a squirrel.


216
0:5:32,531 --> 0:5:33,766
Jesse Green: Holy.


217
0:5:33,766 --> 0:5:34,8
Paul: Big enough?


218
0:5:34,8 --> 0:5:35,734
Jesse Green: Yah it's
a pretty big stump.


219
0:5:35,734 --> 0:5:36,735
I love it.


220
0:5:36,735 --> 0:5:37,936
I've got an arborist
that I'd like to


221
0:5:37,936 --> 0:5:38,904
come have a look at it.


222
0:5:38,904 --> 0:5:39,972
Paul: Okay sure.


223
0:5:39,972 --> 0:5:40,939
Jesse Green: Just so I
know what I'm up against.


224
0:5:40,939 --> 0:5:42,241
Whenever I have a
project like this,


225
0:5:42,241 --> 0:5:43,609
I call in my buddy
Ken the arborist.


226
0:5:43,609 --> 0:5:45,511
He'll let me know what
makes this thing tick.


227
0:5:45,511 --> 0:5:47,179
Because I want to know
everything about this


228
0:5:47,179 --> 0:5:49,381
stump that I possibly can
before I start carving it.


229
0:5:49,381 --> 0:5:50,749
Ken: This is
a sugar maple.


230
0:5:50,749 --> 0:5:52,584
This is the one they
get the syrup out of.


231
0:5:52,584 --> 0:5:54,86
Maybe I should
look at the top.


232
0:5:54,86 --> 0:5:57,656
Jesse Green: Brett would
you ladder me please?


233
0:5:57,656 --> 0:5:58,924
Brett: Here you go Jesse.


234
0:5:58,924 --> 0:6:0,692
Where do you think we uh,
where do you want it?


235
0:6:0,692 --> 0:6:1,994
Jesse Green: I want
to lean it against


236
0:6:1,994 --> 0:6:3,462
the stump dude,
if preferable.


237
0:6:3,462 --> 0:6:4,496
Thank you.


238
0:6:4,496 --> 0:6:5,898
It actually goes
the other way.


239
0:6:5,898 --> 0:6:7,32
Brett: Oh does it?


240
0:6:7,32 --> 0:6:7,966
Jesse Green: Yes.


241
0:6:7,966 --> 0:6:9,234
Brett: Oh, who
would've thunk?


242
0:6:9,234 --> 0:6:10,436
Jesse Green: Uh, the
guy who put the scans


243
0:6:10,436 --> 0:6:11,637
on the bottom thunk it.


244
0:6:11,637 --> 0:6:12,571
What do you see?


245
0:6:12,571 --> 0:6:13,672
Ken: There's
no rot at all.


246
0:6:13,672 --> 0:6:14,673
Jesse Green: Awesome.


247
0:6:14,673 --> 0:6:15,674
Ken: Looks
pretty strong.


248
0:6:15,674 --> 0:6:16,775
I'll tell you what;


249
0:6:16,775 --> 0:6:18,143
sugar maple is one
of the hardest trees


250
0:6:18,143 --> 0:6:19,244
we have in New England.


251
0:6:19,244 --> 0:6:21,28
Jesse's up against
a mighty hard wood.


252
0:6:21,28 --> 0:6:22,414
Jesse Green: This
is the kind of thing


253
0:6:22,414 --> 0:6:23,715
that makes my
mouth water.


254
0:6:23,715 --> 0:6:25,784
Stump jobs
pay top dollar.


255
0:6:25,784 --> 0:6:28,32
But I only get one shot.


256
0:6:28,32 --> 0:6:30,322
Can't just grow another
tree and try again and if


257
0:6:30,322 --> 0:6:32,9
I screw it up, they're not
going to want to pay and


258
0:6:32,9 --> 0:6:35,494
then I'll have wasted days
of my time and resources.


259
0:6:35,494 --> 0:6:36,728
Paul: Great so you
think you can do it?


260
0:6:36,728 --> 0:6:38,397
Jesse Green: Myself and
my crack team of uh,


261
0:6:38,397 --> 0:6:40,432
chainsaw sculpting
professionals are on it.


262
0:6:40,432 --> 0:6:41,433
Paul: Okay.


263
0:6:41,433 --> 0:6:42,401
Jesse Green: We're
going to squirrel this


264
0:6:42,401 --> 0:6:43,335
thing out for you guys.


265
0:6:43,335 --> 0:6:44,703
Paul: I'm sure you are.


266
0:6:44,703 --> 0:6:46,205
Jesse Green: First,
I'll carve out the


267
0:6:46,205 --> 0:6:47,573
squirrels head,
outstretched arm,


268
0:6:47,573 --> 0:6:48,674
tummy and tail.


269
0:6:48,674 --> 0:6:49,942
Then using the sander,


270
0:6:49,942 --> 0:6:51,31
I'll cut in the
fine details of the


271
0:6:51,31 --> 0:6:52,544
squirrel's face and paws.


272
0:6:52,544 --> 0:6:55,47
To finish up I'll stain
it, and as an added bonus,


273
0:6:55,47 --> 0:7:13,899
I'll attach giant acorns
to the squirrel's hands.


274
0:7:13,899 --> 0:7:15,734
This is really hard wood.


275
0:7:15,734 --> 0:7:17,35
I would say this is
probably one of the


276
0:7:17,35 --> 0:7:18,403
harder stumps that
I've ever had to carve.


277
0:7:18,403 --> 0:7:19,571
It's a big hard tree.


278
0:7:19,571 --> 0:7:22,307
It's had time to really
just turn into a big rock.


279
0:7:22,307 --> 0:7:23,408
It's a hard wood.


280
0:7:23,408 --> 0:7:24,643
I feel like I'm
cutting into the


281
0:7:24,643 --> 0:7:25,644
top of a mountain.


282
0:7:25,644 --> 0:7:26,845
Here's the snow
covered peak.


283
0:7:26,845 --> 0:7:28,48
It's iced and
it's petrified.


284
0:7:28,48 --> 0:7:29,548
And I have to carve it.


285
0:7:29,548 --> 0:7:31,583
It's not even trying
to figure out a shape,


286
0:7:31,583 --> 0:7:33,986
as just trying to simply
get into the thing


287
0:7:33,986 --> 0:7:37,422
so I can try to figure out
where that squirrel is.


288
0:7:37,422 --> 0:7:38,624
Dad?


289
0:7:38,624 --> 0:7:39,691
Can you change that chain?


290
0:7:39,691 --> 0:7:41,226
Jay Green: I'm going
to change the chain.


291
0:7:41,226 --> 0:7:43,228
I can see it by the
way it's cutting.


292
0:7:43,228 --> 0:7:44,596
Jesse Green: Dude this
is the hardest wood


293
0:7:44,596 --> 0:7:46,64
I've ever had to
deal with I think.


294
0:7:46,64 --> 0:7:47,9
Jay Green: This stump is
going to be a (bleep).


295
0:7:47,9 --> 0:7:49,468
I've never seen
anything like this.


296
0:7:49,468 --> 0:7:55,674
We're going to have our
work cut out for us.


297
0:7:55,674 --> 0:7:58,71
Man: This noise
is too much.


298
0:7:58,71 --> 0:8:0,846
I, I can't even
hear myself.


299
0:8:0,846 --> 0:8:3,482
I'd say that's got to
stop and all of this.


300
0:8:3,482 --> 0:8:5,417
And this is Sunday.


301
0:8:5,417 --> 0:8:7,653
You have permission
to do this?


302
0:8:7,653 --> 0:8:8,921
Jesse Green: This
is their tree and


303
0:8:8,921 --> 0:8:9,922
I'm making them
a sculpture.


304
0:8:9,922 --> 0:8:10,989
Man: On Sunday?


305
0:8:10,989 --> 0:8:12,357
I mean you can hear
it for like four or


306
0:8:12,357 --> 0:8:13,725
five blocks away.


307
0:8:13,725 --> 0:8:16,695
Jesse Green: This guy
just marched in here and


308
0:8:16,695 --> 0:8:18,96
tell me I have
to shut down and


309
0:8:18,96 --> 0:8:19,498
he just wants me gone.


310
0:8:19,498 --> 0:8:21,567
I'm way off the street,
I don't understand why.


311
0:8:21,567 --> 0:8:23,201
Man: But, but the,
but the noise.


312
0:8:23,201 --> 0:8:24,503
Jesse Green: I don't
know what to tell you.


313
0:8:24,503 --> 0:8:26,338
I'm only here for, for
another day or so and,


314
0:8:26,338 --> 0:8:27,706
and I, I'm on, I'm on.


315
0:8:27,706 --> 0:8:28,84
Man: Another day or so.


316
0:8:28,84 --> 0:8:30,42
Jesse Green:
Private property.


317
0:8:30,42 --> 0:8:31,343
Man: That saw, you
would think that


318
0:8:31,343 --> 0:8:32,544
you could have a
muffler on it or


319
0:8:32,544 --> 0:8:33,912
something to silence it.


320
0:8:33,912 --> 0:8:35,18
Jesse Green: But,
but you, you can't.


321
0:8:35,18 --> 0:8:35,948
Uh.


322
0:8:35,948 --> 0:8:36,848
Man: Sure you could.


323
0:8:36,848 --> 0:8:37,916
Jesse Green:
No you can't.


324
0:8:37,916 --> 0:8:39,51
Man: I'm going to call
the police department


325
0:8:39,51 --> 0:8:40,285
and have you shut down.


326
0:8:40,285 --> 0:8:41,253
Jesse Green: What?


327
0:8:41,253 --> 0:8:42,154
Why?


328
0:8:42,154 --> 0:8:43,255
Man: How much more
can I say to you?


329
0:8:43,255 --> 0:8:44,156
(Bleep).


330
0:8:44,156 --> 0:8:45,29
Jesse Green: Call
the cops right now.


331
0:8:45,29 --> 0:8:46,191
Man: What are
you filming here?


332
0:8:46,191 --> 0:8:47,259
Jesse Green: Hey,
hey, hey, hey.


333
0:8:47,259 --> 0:8:48,393
Man: You don't have my
permission to (bleep).


334
0:8:48,393 --> 0:8:49,294
Jesse Green: Sir.


335
0:8:49,294 --> 0:8:50,395
Man: I'm going
to call the police


336
0:8:50,395 --> 0:8:51,33
[inaudible] right now.


337
0:8:51,33 --> 0:8:52,397
Jesse Green: Good
call the police,


338
0:8:52,397 --> 0:8:53,565
maybe you can do it
from the street okay,


339
0:8:53,565 --> 0:8:54,866
this is private property.


340
0:8:54,866 --> 0:8:56,134
Man: Hello, yes.


341
0:8:56,134 --> 0:8:58,57
Down here on the corner
of Washington Street


342
0:8:58,57 --> 0:8:59,905
and Church Street.


343
0:8:59,905 --> 0:9:1,406
Would you come
down immediately?


344
0:9:1,406 --> 0:9:3,408
Jesse Green: This guy
wants to call the cops


345
0:9:3,408 --> 0:9:4,643
and have me shut down.


346
0:9:4,643 --> 0:9:5,744
Forget it I'm
going back to work.


347
0:9:5,744 --> 0:9:6,745
I got to finish
this thing.


348
0:9:6,745 --> 0:9:8,714
I'm just going to do
as much as I can do.


349
0:9:8,714 --> 0:9:10,315
Ah.


350
0:9:10,315 --> 0:9:12,317
[siren]


351
0:9:12,317 --> 0:9:14,953
What the hell is this?


352
0:9:14,953 --> 0:9:26,131
Great, the cops are here.


353
0:9:26,131 --> 0:9:28,266
Jesse Green: Great
the cops are here.


354
0:9:28,266 --> 0:9:29,334
Officer: I want to
see what you're


355
0:9:29,334 --> 0:9:30,235
doing out here.


356
0:9:30,235 --> 0:9:31,57
Jesse Green: I'm
making a squirrel.


357
0:9:31,57 --> 0:9:32,771
Forgive me I've had a,


358
0:9:32,771 --> 0:9:34,239
a few obstacles
on this project.


359
0:9:34,239 --> 0:9:35,34
Officer: I had a little
noise complaint,


360
0:9:35,34 --> 0:9:36,508
just checking on
the noise level.


361
0:9:36,508 --> 0:9:38,176
You are well
within your limits.


362
0:9:38,176 --> 0:9:39,244
So.


363
0:9:39,244 --> 0:9:40,312
Jesse Green: When I
saw you it just made me


364
0:9:40,312 --> 0:9:41,58
think that I was up
against the you know,


365
0:9:41,58 --> 0:9:42,581
the ultimate obstacle.


366
0:9:42,581 --> 0:9:43,815
Officer: Not a
problem, alright.


367
0:9:43,815 --> 0:9:45,5
You have a good day.


368
0:9:45,5 --> 0:9:46,351
Jesse Green: I
can't believe he


369
0:9:46,351 --> 0:9:47,452
really called
the cops on me.


370
0:9:47,452 --> 0:9:49,488
I just wasted an hour
dealing with a neighbor


371
0:9:49,488 --> 0:9:50,589
and the cops.


372
0:9:50,589 --> 0:9:56,762
My day is shot.


373
0:9:56,762 --> 0:9:58,3
Beth Green: I want
you to be careful up


374
0:9:58,3 --> 0:9:59,131
on the scaffolding today.


375
0:9:59,131 --> 0:10:0,165
It's slippery up there.


376
0:10:0,165 --> 0:10:1,133
Jesse Green: I will.


377
0:10:1,133 --> 0:10:2,267
Beth Green: I don't
want you to get too


378
0:10:2,267 --> 0:10:3,535
far behind but I
do want you to be safe.


379
0:10:3,535 --> 0:10:5,437
With multiple jobs going
on at the same time it's


380
0:10:5,437 --> 0:10:8,4
really important that
Jesse stays on schedule.


381
0:10:8,4 --> 0:10:9,107
Jesse Green: I'm not
getting behind anymore.


382
0:10:9,107 --> 0:10:10,208
This is ridiculous.


383
0:10:10,208 --> 0:10:10,942
Beth Green: Okay.


384
0:10:10,942 --> 0:10:11,943
Jesse Green: I love you.


385
0:10:11,943 --> 0:10:13,445
Beth Green: Me too.


386
0:10:13,445 --> 0:10:14,68
Missy: Keith,
he's coming.


387
0:10:14,68 --> 0:10:16,314
Keith: Make sure
you have no drips.


388
0:10:16,314 --> 0:10:17,215
Missy: I'm checking.


389
0:10:17,215 --> 0:10:18,25
Jesse Green: I heard
you say make sure


390
0:10:18,25 --> 0:10:19,51
you have no drips.


391
0:10:19,51 --> 0:10:20,118
Missy: There
are no drips.


392
0:10:20,118 --> 0:10:21,286
Jesse Green:
How about that?


393
0:10:21,286 --> 0:10:22,254
About that.


394
0:10:22,254 --> 0:10:23,188
Missy: What this?


395
0:10:23,188 --> 0:10:24,289
Jesse Green:
Just, like this.


396
0:10:24,289 --> 0:10:25,557
Missy: Nothing with
Jesse is ever easy,


397
0:10:25,557 --> 0:10:27,259
he really needs to
just do his part,


398
0:10:27,259 --> 0:10:28,427
let us do ours.


399
0:10:28,427 --> 0:10:29,528
Jesse Green: Wipe it.


400
0:10:29,528 --> 0:10:30,562
Missy: What the hell?


401
0:10:30,562 --> 0:10:31,563
Jesse Green: Wipe it.


402
0:10:31,563 --> 0:10:32,631
Missy: I'm not
in the mood.


403
0:10:32,631 --> 0:10:33,932
I brought, Keith and
I are here to help


404
0:10:33,932 --> 0:10:35,67
him be able to do more.


405
0:10:35,67 --> 0:10:36,368
Jesse Green: I
have this idea.


406
0:10:36,368 --> 0:10:38,3
I'm thinking I'll
make the squirrel


407
0:10:38,3 --> 0:10:39,504
throwing nuts
at the house.


408
0:10:39,504 --> 0:10:40,572
Missy: So you're
going to be


409
0:10:40,572 --> 0:10:41,673
carving out some acorns?


410
0:10:41,673 --> 0:10:43,75
Jesse Green: No I want
you to fabricate acorns.


411
0:10:43,75 --> 0:10:45,11
Like I'm, like
this bigish.


412
0:10:45,11 --> 0:10:45,977
Missy: Okay.


413
0:10:45,977 --> 0:10:46,978
Keith: Two or three?


414
0:10:46,978 --> 0:10:47,913
Jesse Green:
Make it four.


415
0:10:47,913 --> 0:10:49,181
Everybody tells me
I have to delegate.


416
0:10:49,181 --> 0:10:51,817
Well Keith and Missy
here's your big chance.


417
0:10:51,817 --> 0:10:53,719
I'm having these guys
handle the acorns so


418
0:10:53,719 --> 0:10:56,121
I can get back to
carving the squirrel.


419
0:10:56,121 --> 0:11:3,261
Jump in.


420
0:11:3,261 --> 0:11:4,496
Jay Green: So
your mother and


421
0:11:4,496 --> 0:11:6,498
I want to plan
a vacation.


422
0:11:6,498 --> 0:11:7,766
Jesse Green: To?


423
0:11:7,766 --> 0:11:8,767
Jay Green: Greece.


424
0:11:8,767 --> 0:11:11,36
I don't know what your
schedule is, but.


425
0:11:11,36 --> 0:11:12,504
Jesse Green: Me, I'm
not going to Greece.


426
0:11:12,504 --> 0:11:15,107
Jay Green: No,
I want a break.


427
0:11:15,107 --> 0:11:16,641
Jesse Green: Oh.


428
0:11:16,641 --> 0:11:17,843
Jay Green: Oh.


429
0:11:17,843 --> 0:11:19,77
Jesse Green: I
thought my dad was


430
0:11:19,77 --> 0:11:20,245
inviting me on vacation.


431
0:11:20,245 --> 0:11:22,781
It turns out he just
wants to go on vacation.


432
0:11:22,781 --> 0:11:24,216
Jay Green: I need a break.


433
0:11:24,216 --> 0:11:26,284
It's going to be a big
deal with your momma.


434
0:11:26,284 --> 0:11:28,19
Jesse Green: Yah, I can't
give you a break though.


435
0:11:28,19 --> 0:11:29,454
So tell her no.


436
0:11:29,454 --> 0:11:30,689
Jay Green:<i> (laughing).</i>


437
0:11:30,689 --> 0:11:31,757
I'm not going
to tell her no.


438
0:11:31,757 --> 0:11:32,724
You tell her no.


439
0:11:32,724 --> 0:11:33,825
<i> (laughing).</i>


440
0:11:33,825 --> 0:11:35,327
Jesse Green: I'm just
busting my dad's chops.


441
0:11:35,327 --> 0:11:36,528
Of course he can
go on vacation,


442
0:11:36,528 --> 0:11:37,696
just not right now.


443
0:11:37,696 --> 0:11:38,663
We are too busy.


444
0:11:38,663 --> 0:11:40,98
When even one
person is missing,


445
0:11:40,98 --> 0:11:41,8
it throws the whole
operation off.


446
0:11:41,8 --> 0:11:43,368
I say you don't
go, you don't go.


447
0:11:43,368 --> 0:11:44,402
Jay Green: Oh
we're going.


448
0:11:44,402 --> 0:11:49,541
We're the parents.


449
0:11:49,541 --> 0:11:51,309
Jesse Green: Where do
you suppose Brett is?


450
0:11:51,309 --> 0:11:52,444
Jay Green: Brett supposed
to meet you here?


451
0:11:52,444 --> 0:11:53,779
Jesse Green: I don't
know where he is.


452
0:11:53,779 --> 0:11:54,746
But he's not here.


453
0:11:54,746 --> 0:11:56,681
And I, I'm already
losing time so.


454
0:11:56,681 --> 0:11:57,983
Brett's new to the team,


455
0:11:57,983 --> 0:12:0,118
so he's still got
a lot to learn.


456
0:12:0,118 --> 0:12:1,62
You got to be kidding me.


457
0:12:1,62 --> 0:12:3,555
But I only have just
so much patience


458
0:12:3,555 --> 0:12:4,489
for that kid.


459
0:12:4,489 --> 0:12:6,24
I expect a lot
more out of him.


460
0:12:6,24 --> 0:12:7,592
We have to unload
this stuff.


461
0:12:7,592 --> 0:12:8,693
Jay Green: What
the (bleep).


462
0:12:8,693 --> 0:12:10,28
That's not my job.


463
0:12:10,28 --> 0:12:11,29
Where's Brett?


464
0:12:11,29 --> 0:12:12,63
I mean you want
to call him?


465
0:12:12,63 --> 0:12:13,298
Jesse Green: I don't
know where this kid is


466
0:12:13,298 --> 0:12:14,399
and I got to get
this stuff going.


467
0:12:14,399 --> 0:12:16,368
Today is not starting
off too well.


468
0:12:16,368 --> 0:12:18,36
Brett's not here,
I don't know why.


469
0:12:18,36 --> 0:12:19,838
But it's going to take
awhile for my dad and


470
0:12:19,838 --> 0:12:21,573
I now to unload this
stuff from the trailer


471
0:12:21,573 --> 0:12:26,77
so I can keep working
on the squirrel.


472
0:12:26,77 --> 0:12:28,38
That's strike
one on Brett.


473
0:12:28,38 --> 0:12:36,988
Dammit!


474
0:12:36,988 --> 0:12:39,658
Dude, where were you?


475
0:12:39,658 --> 0:12:40,592
Why?


476
0:12:40,592 --> 0:12:42,227
Brett: I thought
it was a day off.


477
0:12:42,227 --> 0:12:43,962
Jesse Green: No dude.


478
0:12:43,962 --> 0:12:45,263
(Bleep) no dude.


479
0:12:45,263 --> 0:12:46,898
Like no, I have,
I told you I,


480
0:12:46,898 --> 0:12:48,633
we're working straight
through on this project.


481
0:12:48,633 --> 0:12:50,802
I really need to get
this done on time,


482
0:12:50,802 --> 0:12:52,27
I know Brett
has potential.


483
0:12:52,27 --> 0:12:53,972
But he is just not showing
it to me right now.


484
0:12:53,972 --> 0:12:56,508
My dad and I had to unload
the trailer by ourselves,


485
0:12:56,508 --> 0:12:58,81
which put us even
further behind.


486
0:12:58,81 --> 0:12:59,945
Thank you very much.


487
0:12:59,945 --> 0:13:1,613
He's creating more
work when I need him to


488
0:13:1,613 --> 0:13:3,381
help me get
back on schedule.


489
0:13:3,381 --> 0:13:5,217
Brett: Alright, I'm sorry,
it won't happen again.


490
0:13:5,217 --> 0:13:7,886
Jesse Green: Help
me, help you help me.


491
0:13:7,886 --> 0:13:8,854
Okay.


492
0:13:8,854 --> 0:13:9,754
Brett: Alright.


493
0:13:9,754 --> 0:13:10,722
Jesse Green: You
understand what I'm


494
0:13:10,722 --> 0:13:11,957
saying?


495
0:13:11,957 --> 0:13:12,958
Brett: Yah.


496
0:13:12,958 --> 0:13:21,566
Jesse Green: Thank you.


497
0:13:21,566 --> 0:13:22,968
It hurts.


498
0:13:22,968 --> 0:13:24,369
It hurts a lot.


499
0:13:24,369 --> 0:13:27,639
This hard wood is
doing a number on me.


500
0:13:27,639 --> 0:13:29,474
It's doing a number
on my saws and


501
0:13:29,474 --> 0:13:30,775
let me tell you
something else.


502
0:13:30,775 --> 0:13:32,444
When the hardwood
hits you in the face,


503
0:13:32,444 --> 0:13:34,112
it really (bleep) hurts.


504
0:13:34,112 --> 0:13:36,181
It just a more abrasive
saw dust, you know,


505
0:13:36,181 --> 0:13:38,49
the chips are bigger,
they're sharper,


506
0:13:38,49 --> 0:13:39,885
they're coming at you
harder and faster.


507
0:13:39,885 --> 0:13:41,519
They're just repelling
right off that


508
0:13:41,519 --> 0:13:46,958
chain back into my
face, you know?


509
0:13:46,958 --> 0:13:56,902
Ah, I'm hit.


510
0:13:56,902 --> 0:13:58,937
(Bleep).


511
0:13:58,937 --> 0:14:0,972
Dad?


512
0:14:0,972 --> 0:14:4,309
Jay Green: He's
bleeding pretty good.


513
0:14:4,309 --> 0:14:8,48
Jesse Green:
Ah, it got me.


514
0:14:8,48 --> 0:14:9,648
Jay Green: Is it bad?


515
0:14:9,648 --> 0:14:10,715
Jesse Green: It hurts.


516
0:14:10,715 --> 0:14:12,83
Jay Green: Is it deep?


517
0:14:12,83 --> 0:14:13,184
Jesse Green: I.


518
0:14:13,184 --> 0:14:14,185
Jay Green: What'd you do?


519
0:14:14,185 --> 0:14:15,587
Jesse Green:
I cut my hand.


520
0:14:15,587 --> 0:14:17,789
Look at it.


521
0:14:17,789 --> 0:14:19,858
I just took a, just
took a nice sharp piece


522
0:14:19,858 --> 0:14:23,94
right off the, you
know, right off me.


523
0:14:23,94 --> 0:14:25,96
That doesn't make
it any easier.


524
0:14:25,96 --> 0:14:27,399
Standard operating
procedure though.


525
0:14:27,399 --> 0:14:28,4
I'm not going to let.


526
0:14:28,4 --> 0:14:29,501
Jay Green:
Are you sure?


527
0:14:29,501 --> 0:14:30,702
Jesse Green: No,
I'm not going to


528
0:14:30,702 --> 0:14:31,703
let this stop me,


529
0:14:31,703 --> 0:14:32,671
I'll tell you that
much right now.


530
0:14:32,671 --> 0:14:33,672
Alright back up.


531
0:14:33,672 --> 0:14:34,706
Jay Green: Alright.


532
0:14:34,706 --> 0:14:37,409
Jesse Green: Back up,
thank you very much.


533
0:14:37,409 --> 0:14:38,61
Jay Green: I
got a Band-Aid.


534
0:14:38,61 --> 0:14:39,678
Jesse Green: Forget it.


535
0:14:39,678 --> 0:14:40,779
I'm fine.


536
0:14:40,779 --> 0:14:48,286
Jay Green: He doesn't
want a Band-Aid.


537
0:14:48,286 --> 0:14:51,22
Sometimes the job is just
so stressful Jesse just


538
0:14:51,22 --> 0:14:53,591
stresses me out and I
got to find a quiet place


539
0:14:53,591 --> 0:14:57,495
to just relax
and meditate.


540
0:14:57,495 --> 0:14:58,763
Jesse Green: Where
the heck is my dad?


541
0:14:58,763 --> 0:15:0,765
Jesse Green: He's off like
meditating somewhere.


542
0:15:0,765 --> 0:15:2,534
Meditate on your own time.


543
0:15:2,534 --> 0:15:4,402
Jay Green: Hey I take
my meditation serious.


544
0:15:4,402 --> 0:15:5,704
Don't mess with
my meditation.


545
0:15:5,704 --> 0:15:7,238
<i> (laughing).</i>


546
0:15:7,238 --> 0:15:9,341
Brett: I don't know what
Jay is doing back there.


547
0:15:9,341 --> 0:15:19,417
But I'm going to join him.


548
0:15:19,417 --> 0:15:21,72
Jay Green: Hey Jesse.


549
0:15:21,72 --> 0:15:23,555
Sue Green: This
is really awesome.


550
0:15:23,555 --> 0:15:24,756
Jesse Green: I
want to be done.


551
0:15:24,756 --> 0:15:25,757
Sue Green: I hear you.


552
0:15:25,757 --> 0:15:26,758
I'm Sue Green;


553
0:15:26,758 --> 0:15:28,927
I'm the mom of the
Machine Jesse Green.


554
0:15:28,927 --> 0:15:31,429
It's a pretty big
nightmare to worry about


555
0:15:31,429 --> 0:15:33,865
your son being around
chainsaws all day.


556
0:15:33,865 --> 0:15:35,333
So when Jesse's
cutting a sculpture


557
0:15:35,333 --> 0:15:36,701
I like to
check up on him.


558
0:15:36,701 --> 0:15:39,437
Bake some cookies or a
little banana bread.


559
0:15:39,437 --> 0:15:40,972
Like I'm coming
to feed him,


560
0:15:40,972 --> 0:15:42,707
that way I have an
excuse to come over and


561
0:15:42,707 --> 0:15:44,142
check out what's going on.


562
0:15:44,142 --> 0:15:45,31
You sure you
don't want coffee?


563
0:15:45,31 --> 0:15:46,378
Jesse Green: I can't
have coffee right now.


564
0:15:46,378 --> 0:15:47,512
Sue Green: I could
just pour it down,


565
0:15:47,512 --> 0:15:48,513
if you open your mouth,


566
0:15:48,513 --> 0:15:49,647
I'll just pour it
right down there.


567
0:15:49,647 --> 0:15:50,782
<i> (laughing).</i>


568
0:15:50,782 --> 0:15:51,75
Jesse Green: I just uh,
I just want to eat this


569
0:15:51,75 --> 0:15:52,717
and go back to work.


570
0:15:52,717 --> 0:15:53,852
Sue Green: What's
on your hand?


571
0:15:53,852 --> 0:15:54,853
What did you do?


572
0:15:54,853 --> 0:15:55,954
Jesse Green: Nothing.


573
0:15:55,954 --> 0:15:57,122
Sue Green: I don't
want to know.


574
0:15:57,122 --> 0:15:58,189
But I do.


575
0:15:58,189 --> 0:15:59,24
You alright?


576
0:15:59,24 --> 0:15:59,958
Jesse Green:
Yah, I'm fine.


577
0:15:59,958 --> 0:16:0,992
Sue Green: But I
worry about you.


578
0:16:0,992 --> 0:16:2,127
Jesse Green: Thank
you very much.


579
0:16:2,127 --> 0:16:3,128
Sue Green: Alright.


580
0:16:3,128 --> 0:16:4,295
I'm the person who
worries about him


581
0:16:4,295 --> 0:16:5,163
the most I think.


582
0:16:5,163 --> 0:16:6,598
Always have, always will.


583
0:16:6,598 --> 0:16:7,899
When he was little,
we bought him a


584
0:16:7,899 --> 0:16:9,67
little Fisher
Price chainsaw.


585
0:16:9,67 --> 0:16:10,702
I was worried about how
dangerous that was.


586
0:16:10,702 --> 0:16:11,703
I'm worse now.


587
0:16:11,703 --> 0:16:13,71
Every time that
thing starts up and


588
0:16:13,71 --> 0:16:14,873
I can hear it,
I am sweating.


589
0:16:14,873 --> 0:16:16,374
It's very nerve
racking for mom.


590
0:16:16,374 --> 0:16:17,575
You're welcome,
where can I hide


591
0:16:17,575 --> 0:16:18,576
this from your father?


592
0:16:18,576 --> 0:16:19,544
Jesse Green: It's
a little late for


593
0:16:19,544 --> 0:16:20,979
that don't you think?


594
0:16:20,979 --> 0:16:25,183
Sue Green:<i> (laughing).</i>


595
0:16:25,183 --> 0:16:27,118
Brett: Jesse was
a little over the top


596
0:16:27,118 --> 0:16:28,386
about me being late.


597
0:16:28,386 --> 0:16:32,123
So I figured I'd
get him back.


598
0:16:32,123 --> 0:16:34,726
Jesse Green: Dude, dude.


599
0:16:34,726 --> 0:16:36,995
Are you serious Brett?


600
0:16:36,995 --> 0:16:38,63
Hey.


601
0:16:38,63 --> 0:16:39,13
Brett: Oh!


602
0:16:39,13 --> 0:16:43,768
My bad man, my bad.


603
0:16:43,768 --> 0:16:44,836
Jesse Green: Uh hey dude.


604
0:16:44,836 --> 0:17:4,756
You, you got something
on you right there.


605
0:17:4,756 --> 0:17:11,429
Done, I am done.


606
0:17:11,429 --> 0:17:12,497
Paul: Mister Machine.


607
0:17:12,497 --> 0:17:14,99
Nancy and I picked out
a stain we really like.


608
0:17:14,99 --> 0:17:15,366
Jesse Green: Yes,
what you got?


609
0:17:15,366 --> 0:17:16,468
Paul: So hopefully
it's good with you.


610
0:17:16,468 --> 0:17:17,569
My understanding
then you're going to


611
0:17:17,569 --> 0:17:18,603
do two coats of
the stain and


612
0:17:18,603 --> 0:17:20,138
then a coat of
uh, urethane?


613
0:17:20,138 --> 0:17:22,34
Jesse Green: No, uh,
one coat of stain,


614
0:17:22,34 --> 0:17:23,541
you don't want
to do two coats,


615
0:17:23,541 --> 0:17:25,61
because we want that
grain to pop out.


616
0:17:25,61 --> 0:17:26,744
Paul: I thought I had
heard that you were


617
0:17:26,744 --> 0:17:27,812
going to do two
coats of stain.


618
0:17:27,812 --> 0:17:28,88
I didn't know.


619
0:17:28,88 --> 0:17:30,715
Jesse Green:
Yah, uh, no.


620
0:17:30,715 --> 0:17:32,15
Paul: I told Jesse
I expected to see


621
0:17:32,15 --> 0:17:33,651
two coats of stain
on there because


622
0:17:33,651 --> 0:17:35,386
that's what Brett
had told me.


623
0:17:35,386 --> 0:17:37,155
And uh now he tells
me there's only one.


624
0:17:37,155 --> 0:17:38,723
And uh, I'm
just wondering if


625
0:17:38,723 --> 0:17:39,958
I'm getting
short changed here.


626
0:17:39,958 --> 0:17:41,693
Jesse Green: Well who,
Brett told you that he,


627
0:17:41,693 --> 0:17:43,61
he probably shouldn't
have guessed at that.


628
0:17:43,61 --> 0:17:44,429
I don't want one
of my guys to put the


629
0:17:44,429 --> 0:17:45,63
wrong idea in your head.


630
0:17:45,63 --> 0:17:46,831
But you're hearing
it straight from the


631
0:17:46,831 --> 0:17:48,666
horse's ass,
mouth, that's me.


632
0:17:48,666 --> 0:17:49,634
Paul: Okay.


633
0:17:49,634 --> 0:17:50,969
Jesse Green: I'm the
horse's ass mouth.


634
0:17:50,969 --> 0:17:52,103
Brett set me up
for disaster.


635
0:17:52,103 --> 0:17:53,505
He tells somebody
that you're going to


636
0:17:53,505 --> 0:17:54,672
put two coats
of stain on;


637
0:17:54,672 --> 0:17:56,307
they expect two
coats of stain.


638
0:17:56,307 --> 0:17:58,109
Can I ask you,
why would you put


639
0:17:58,109 --> 0:17:59,31
me in that position?


640
0:17:59,31 --> 0:18:0,879
Why would you take
a wild guess at


641
0:18:0,879 --> 0:18:2,514
something you don't know?


642
0:18:2,514 --> 0:18:5,383
This is Brett's
second mistake.


643
0:18:5,383 --> 0:18:7,252
I don't know what I'm
going to do with that kid.


644
0:18:7,252 --> 0:18:8,553
I can't run a
business like this.


645
0:18:8,553 --> 0:18:14,58
Brett has one more
chance and that's it.


646
0:18:14,58 --> 0:18:16,194
Brett: No, I didn't, I
shouldn't have guessed.


647
0:18:16,194 --> 0:18:17,395
Jesse Green: No you
shouldn't have guessed.


648
0:18:17,395 --> 0:18:18,796
It needs one
coat of stain,


649
0:18:18,796 --> 0:18:19,931
you don't know that.


650
0:18:19,931 --> 0:18:21,666
You wouldn't have any
(bleep) idea of that.


651
0:18:21,666 --> 0:18:23,401
So why would you
guess at that?


652
0:18:23,401 --> 0:18:25,203
Why would you put
me in that position?


653
0:18:25,203 --> 0:18:26,771
Why would you take
a wild guess at


654
0:18:26,771 --> 0:18:28,206
something you don't know?


655
0:18:28,206 --> 0:18:30,141
Brett: Jesse does
expect more from me and


656
0:18:30,141 --> 0:18:31,876
from now on, I'm
going to deliver.


657
0:18:31,876 --> 0:18:33,178
Jesse Green: Being
23 is only going to


658
0:18:33,178 --> 0:18:34,379
get you just
so far with me.


659
0:18:34,379 --> 0:18:35,547
You know what I mean?


660
0:18:35,547 --> 0:18:36,714
I'm hard on these
guys because I'm


661
0:18:36,714 --> 0:18:38,983
counting on them to
help run my business.


662
0:18:38,983 --> 0:18:40,685
Brett is supposed to
clean up my messes.


663
0:18:40,685 --> 0:18:42,554
Not the other way around.


664
0:18:42,554 --> 0:18:43,888
Oh that's nice.


665
0:18:43,888 --> 0:18:44,956
Jay Green: I don't know,


666
0:18:44,956 --> 0:18:46,191
looks like a
cat right now.


667
0:18:46,191 --> 0:18:47,959
Jesse Green: Now that the
staining is going great,


668
0:18:47,959 --> 0:18:49,427
I'm going to check on
Keith and Missy and see


669
0:18:49,427 --> 0:18:54,365
how they're coming
along with the acorns.


670
0:18:54,365 --> 0:18:55,7
What, what
does, what does,


671
0:18:55,7 --> 0:18:56,668
what does that say?


672
0:18:56,668 --> 0:18:58,436
Keith: My nuts are wet.


673
0:18:58,436 --> 0:19:0,38
Missy: The hardest part
of my job is making


674
0:19:0,38 --> 0:19:2,473
Jesse's dreams
come reality.


675
0:19:2,473 --> 0:19:4,175
He's seeing my work
for the first time.


676
0:19:4,175 --> 0:19:5,21
It looks good;


677
0:19:5,21 --> 0:19:6,511
I just hope he
likes it too.


678
0:19:6,511 --> 0:19:7,579
You think they'll work?


679
0:19:7,579 --> 0:19:8,546
Jesse Green: I love them.


680
0:19:8,546 --> 0:19:9,781
Keith: We tried
to make the nuts


681
0:19:9,781 --> 0:19:10,815
as real as possible.


682
0:19:10,815 --> 0:19:11,783
Jesse Green: Yah.


683
0:19:11,783 --> 0:19:12,884
Missy: I think they
look pretty good.


684
0:19:12,884 --> 0:19:14,18
So I think the client
will like them.


685
0:19:14,18 --> 0:19:15,32
Jesse Green: Keith
and Missy did a


686
0:19:15,32 --> 0:19:16,487
great job on the acorns.


687
0:19:16,487 --> 0:19:20,525
Now I have to mount
them on the squirrel.


688
0:19:20,525 --> 0:19:22,126
Paul and Nancy have
invited a bunch of


689
0:19:22,126 --> 0:19:23,494
friends over for
the unveiling of


690
0:19:23,494 --> 0:19:24,495
the squirrel today.


691
0:19:24,495 --> 0:19:26,397
So while Paul's off
dealing with that I have


692
0:19:26,397 --> 0:19:28,766
to get the acorns attached
before anyone sees them.


693
0:19:28,766 --> 0:19:31,2
Listen the nuts,
it's a surprise.


694
0:19:31,2 --> 0:19:33,304
So we need time
to put them up,


695
0:19:33,304 --> 0:19:35,6
what I need from
you is I need you


696
0:19:35,6 --> 0:19:37,408
to go find Nancy
and occupy her.


697
0:19:37,408 --> 0:19:39,777
Keep her away from the
view of the squirrel.


698
0:19:39,777 --> 0:19:40,845
Brett: I think I
can handle this.


699
0:19:40,845 --> 0:19:42,28
Jesse Green: This is
Brett's last chance.


700
0:19:42,28 --> 0:19:44,382
If he can't take care of
this one simple thing,


701
0:19:44,382 --> 0:19:46,684
I don't know what I'm
going to do with him.


702
0:19:46,684 --> 0:19:47,685
Brett: What
you got there?


703
0:19:47,685 --> 0:19:48,786
Nancy: It's a
squirrel book.


704
0:19:48,786 --> 0:19:49,721
Brett: A squirrel book.


705
0:19:49,721 --> 0:19:50,788
You had fifteen
of them right?


706
0:19:50,788 --> 0:19:51,856
Nancy: Yah.


707
0:19:51,856 --> 0:19:53,224
Brett: Just eating
out your hands.


708
0:19:53,224 --> 0:19:54,325
Nancy: They, they
were trained.


709
0:19:54,325 --> 0:19:55,36
Brett: Where have
they been anyway?


710
0:19:55,36 --> 0:19:56,561
I've been, I've
been curious uh,


711
0:19:56,561 --> 0:19:57,695
I haven't seen any?


712
0:19:57,695 --> 0:19:58,83
Nancy: They don't like the
sound of the chainsaw.


713
0:19:58,83 --> 0:19:59,998
Brett: They don't,
they should put


714
0:19:59,998 --> 0:20:0,999
that in the book.


715
0:20:0,999 --> 0:20:1,866
Nancy: Yah.


716
0:20:1,866 --> 0:20:3,67
Brett:<i> (laughing).</i>


717
0:20:3,67 --> 0:20:4,168
I can't mess this up.


718
0:20:4,168 --> 0:20:6,671
If I do, Jesse's
going to kill me.


719
0:20:6,671 --> 0:20:7,705
Jay Green: That's it.


720
0:20:7,705 --> 0:20:9,173
Jesse Green: Are you
saying that's good angle?


721
0:20:9,173 --> 0:20:10,208
Is that right?


722
0:20:10,208 --> 0:20:11,376
Jay Green: No,
turn the nut.


723
0:20:11,376 --> 0:20:12,477
Jesse Green: I'm
thinking like this.


724
0:20:12,477 --> 0:20:14,112
Jay Green: No
the other way.


725
0:20:14,112 --> 0:20:16,347
Tilt it towards
you just a little.


726
0:20:16,347 --> 0:20:17,882
There you go,
like, like that.


727
0:20:17,882 --> 0:20:19,183
Jesse Green: Is
everybody agreed that


728
0:20:19,183 --> 0:20:20,385
this nut looks right?


729
0:20:20,385 --> 0:20:21,419
Jay Green: Now
it looks right.


730
0:20:21,419 --> 0:20:24,222
Can you move it
down a tiny bit?


731
0:20:24,222 --> 0:20:25,29
Jesse Green: Oh.


732
0:20:25,29 --> 0:20:26,658
Jay Green: How come he
never listens to me?


733
0:20:26,658 --> 0:20:27,592
I'm always right.


734
0:20:27,592 --> 0:20:29,27
I taught him.


735
0:20:29,27 --> 0:20:30,228
Jesse Green: What?


736
0:20:30,228 --> 0:20:31,262
What?


737
0:20:31,262 --> 0:20:32,96
What?


738
0:20:32,96 --> 0:20:33,164
Jay Green: You're too;


739
0:20:33,164 --> 0:20:34,132
you're too much of an
angle to the squirrel.


740
0:20:34,132 --> 0:20:35,33
Jesse Green: What?


741
0:20:35,33 --> 0:20:36,34
Every time I
put the thing,


742
0:20:36,34 --> 0:20:37,68
you have to tell me.


743
0:20:37,68 --> 0:20:39,17
Alright, here we go.


744
0:20:39,17 --> 0:20:40,905
Jay Green: Can you go
down just a hair more?


745
0:20:40,905 --> 0:20:41,773
Jesse Green: What?


746
0:20:41,773 --> 0:20:42,774
Jay Green: Just a hair.


747
0:20:42,774 --> 0:20:44,142
Jesse Green: No it
can't go down anymore.


748
0:20:44,142 --> 0:20:45,677
Why won't my dad
just let me do it?


749
0:20:45,677 --> 0:20:47,45
We have ten minutes
before Paul and


750
0:20:47,45 --> 0:20:48,212
Nancy's friends arrive,


751
0:20:48,212 --> 0:20:49,781
and I don't want them to
see it before it's done.


752
0:20:49,781 --> 0:20:51,616
Jay Green: Just a hair,
just a hair more.


753
0:20:51,616 --> 0:20:52,884
Jesse Green: Thank God
Brett is keeping Nancy


754
0:20:52,884 --> 0:20:55,386
busy because attaching
these acorns is taking so


755
0:20:55,386 --> 0:20:57,155
much longer with
my dad helping out.


756
0:20:57,155 --> 0:20:59,223
Nancy: Those are all my
little squirrel doodads.


757
0:20:59,223 --> 0:21:0,291
Brett: Little rascals.


758
0:21:0,291 --> 0:21:2,6
Huh, you got a lot of
them over here right?


759
0:21:2,6 --> 0:21:3,227
Nancy: I do, yep.


760
0:21:3,227 --> 0:21:4,429
Brett: I don't know
anything about squirrels.


761
0:21:4,429 --> 0:21:5,73
I don't know
what I'm doing.


762
0:21:5,73 --> 0:21:6,964
Missy: Oh yeah.


763
0:21:6,964 --> 0:21:8,66
Jay Green: Good, yah!


764
0:21:8,66 --> 0:21:9,5
Jesse Green: That's
the nuts right there.


765
0:21:9,5 --> 0:21:10,635
That is the nuts.


766
0:21:10,635 --> 0:21:11,602
Keith: Your
dad was right.


767
0:21:11,602 --> 0:21:12,67
Jay Green: That's good.


768
0:21:12,67 --> 0:21:14,238
I gave him an opinion and


769
0:21:14,238 --> 0:21:15,707
it turned out
to be correct.


770
0:21:15,707 --> 0:21:19,11
He won't admit it,
but I was right.


771
0:21:19,11 --> 0:21:20,111
Nancy: Um, and
the one that's up


772
0:21:20,111 --> 0:21:21,45
there in the bookcase.


773
0:21:21,45 --> 0:21:22,8
<i> [phone rings]</i>


774
0:21:22,8 --> 0:21:22,98
Brett: Oh.


775
0:21:22,98 --> 0:21:23,948
Hello.


776
0:21:23,948 --> 0:21:24,882
It is?


777
0:21:24,882 --> 0:21:25,983
Alright I will be
right out then.


778
0:21:25,983 --> 0:21:27,18
Nancy: I can see him?


779
0:21:27,18 --> 0:21:27,985
Brett: Alright, great.


780
0:21:27,985 --> 0:21:28,986
Yah, we're ready to go.


781
0:21:28,986 --> 0:21:30,254
Jesse Green: Looks
like Brett finally did


782
0:21:30,254 --> 0:21:31,155
something right.


783
0:21:31,155 --> 0:21:32,23
'Cause he managed
to keep Nancy busy.


784
0:21:32,23 --> 0:21:32,99
Was he boring you?


785
0:21:32,99 --> 0:21:33,958
Nancy: No he was not.


786
0:21:33,958 --> 0:21:34,859
Jesse Green: Okay.


787
0:21:34,859 --> 0:21:35,86
Nancy: He was, he
was listening to my


788
0:21:35,86 --> 0:21:36,861
ranting and raving.


789
0:21:36,861 --> 0:21:37,929
Jesse Green: Oh very good.


790
0:21:37,929 --> 0:21:39,397
Brett: I'm so glad I
finally made Jesse happy.


791
0:21:39,397 --> 0:21:40,531
This is the best
job I've ever had.


792
0:21:40,531 --> 0:21:42,567
And I don't want to stop
working with these guys.


793
0:21:42,567 --> 0:21:44,102
Jesse Green: Now that Paul
and Nancy's friends are


794
0:21:44,102 --> 0:21:45,803
here everybody's ready
to see the squirrel.


795
0:21:45,803 --> 0:21:47,305
You guys want to
see a sculpture?


796
0:21:47,305 --> 0:21:48,339
Nancy: Yes.


797
0:21:48,339 --> 0:21:50,641
Jesse Green: Alright,
let's do it.


798
0:21:50,641 --> 0:21:52,276
Nancy, we've got a
little surprise for you.


799
0:21:52,276 --> 0:21:54,78
Nancy: I hope it's still
a squirrel under there.


800
0:21:54,78 --> 0:21:55,279
Jesse Green: It might be.


801
0:21:55,279 --> 0:21:56,848
Now I know you guys
wanted a waving squirrel,


802
0:21:56,848 --> 0:21:58,85
but I had this
other idea.


803
0:21:58,85 --> 0:21:59,617
Paul: Alright.


804
0:21:59,617 --> 0:22:0,685
Nancy: Okay.


805
0:22:0,685 --> 0:22:1,786
Jesse Green: That I think
you're going to like.


806
0:22:1,786 --> 0:22:2,687
Is everybody ready?


807
0:22:2,687 --> 0:22:4,122
Crowd: Yah.


808
0:22:4,122 --> 0:22:5,256
Jesse Green: There we go.


809
0:22:5,256 --> 0:22:6,391
Nancy: Oh!


810
0:22:6,391 --> 0:22:12,463
Wow, we loved it.


811
0:22:12,463 --> 0:22:13,431
Paul: It was
unbelievable.


812
0:22:13,431 --> 0:22:15,533
Much more than
we ever expected.


813
0:22:15,533 --> 0:22:19,203
We know squirrels and that
squirrel is unbelievable.


814
0:22:19,203 --> 0:22:20,772
Jesse Green: We had a lot
of work going on this week


815
0:22:20,772 --> 0:22:22,34
and this was a tough job.


816
0:22:22,34 --> 0:22:24,442
I'm still learning
how to run a business.


817
0:22:24,442 --> 0:22:25,977
Every day we get
a little better,


818
0:22:25,977 --> 0:24:25,977
I'm really happy with what
we accomplished this week.
