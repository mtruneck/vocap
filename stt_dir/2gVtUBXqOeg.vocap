###4 THOBEY CAMPION: Hey, this is Thobey.
###6 We're in North Beach, San Francisco, right now to meet
###7 up with legendary artist, Winston Smith.
###9 
###25 WINSTON SMITH: [INAUDIBLE] later.
###26 THOBEY CAMPION: Pleasure to meet you, Thobey.
###26 WINSTON SMITH: Thobey, good to meet you.
###28 Yeah, that's it.
###29 It's like awesome, two worlds.
###30 THOBEY CAMPION: Thank you.
###31 
###37 So this is it?
###38 WINSTON SMITH: Welcome to Grant's Tomb.
###41 We're right under Grant Avenue.
###43 So this is mainly my work that I've had up for a show, and
###46 then I generally pull curtains across so people don't have to
###51 look at my chaotic studio part.
###55 I was born in Oklahoma.
###57 Then when I was a teenager, I had the brilliant idea to go
###64 to art school.
###66 And went to study Renaissance art in Florence.
###71 My mom's a painter and a sculptress--
###73 really talented.
###74 And I didn't, unfortunately, inherit her skills.
###77 I can sketch and draw, if I wanted to, really well-- but
###82 usually too much effort.
###85 So it's easier to cut up other people's
###87 drawings and use those.
###90 And I kind of discovered the medium of collage.
###95 Before there were photocopy machines, I
###97 would make my own drawings.
###98 And then realized if I cut them I could mix them together
###101 and come up with really absurdist compositions that
###105 were startling.
###106 And once I did see a photocopy machine, I
###111 think Xerox or Olivetti.
###113 In Italy we had Olivetti.
###114 And that kind of changed everything.
###116 Because you could rearrange pictures together, photocopy
###120 it, and it would make them all look like one unit.
###122 At that time, and for a long, long time afterward, whenever
###125 I would present this work or composition, especially for
###129 commercial work like illustration for a magazine,
###132 the art directors would say well, it's not a painting, and
###136 it's not a photograph, so what is it?
###140 So I'm trying to create instant surrealism
###145 that you could get.
###146 I could take a bunch of completely normal things and
###150 put them together and they're not right.
###152 The [INAUDIBLE] one time said you take things that are all
###155 wrong, put them together and suddenly make them right.
###158 That's a piece we used for a Dead Kennedy's
###161 record in the middle.
###164 Mowing down the people, it was on the inside of a record.
###167 THOBEY CAMPION: Do you ever have brushes with the law or
###169 calls from authorities about any of your work?
###174 WINSTON SMITH: No I think I'm either so much under the radar
###177 or they probably figure oh, let him keep doing that.
###181 That way he won't cause any real trouble.
###183 He's just an artist.
###185 THOBEY CAMPION: A lot of articles talk about you coming
###189 back to the States after being away for six
###192 years or so was a real--
###193 WINSTON SMITH: Culture shock, yeah.
###194 When I first arrived in America, I had two friends who
###198 lived here, one who lived in Boston--
###200 New York and Boston, he moved to Boston-- and then one
###203 friend who lived out in San Francisco.
###206 The part of Boston I lived in was right
###208 by the Charles River.
###210 
###214 The shock was that there were TV cameras everywhere.
###218 Not just at banks and office buildings, but at donut shops.
###223 And these little cameras would follow you around.
###228 And like son of a bitch, it's like Orwell.
###230 THOBEY CAMPION: So you were in Boston then.
###231 And then how did you get over to San Francisco?
###234 WINSTON SMITH: I hitchhiked across the country.
###236 San Francisco was full of energy.
###241 It's a small city, it's only seven miles across so you can
###244 walk around.
###244 In fact, there was a bus strike for a couple of weeks
###246 and I did have to walk around everywhere to find anything.
###249 Where I would up working was like a rent a roadie joint
###254 working for different bands like the Tubes, Crosby, Stills
###258 and Nash, Santana, Journey.
###261 A bunch of other local bands would come in and perform at
###264 our sound stages.
###266 I did run into lots of interesting
###269 people in that industry.
###270 And it was right just before punk rock had begun to rear
###275 its ugly head.
###275 THOBEY CAMPION: So what year span are we talking right now?
###278 WINSTON SMITH: '76 and '77.
###280 A lot of places wouldn't book punk bands at that time
###283 because of too much trouble.
###285 The insurance wouldn't cover the place if the windows got
###289 broken or someone got hurt.
###291 And that's why punk rock, I think, was born.
###294 Because so many people who didn't want to perform were
###298 kind of pissed off that all there was was these giant
###302 stadium bands.
###303 All there was was just big show business stuff.
###306 And punk rock was about no, just get up on stage in the
###309 corner of someone's room in a basement someplace.
###313 San Francisco was more of an art movement
###316 for the punk scene.
###317 Because there were people who were artists that couldn't
###320 play anything, but they'd perform and
###322 they'd have an act.
###324 Usually it was funny or it was absurd, it was something
###326 interesting.
###327 THOBEY CAMPION: You mentioned in some interviews about that
###332 time and the spirit that infused the music and the art
###336 was kind of resemblant of Dadaism.
###338 WINSTON SMITH: Totally.
###340 Advertising here doesn't take the form so much of TV ads, or
###345 radio, or billboards--
###347 it's posters.
###349 And we had the opportunity because people have to walk
###353 around to put posters or propaganda for a band, or for
###360 anything really, on the walls that you'd have to see if you
###363 were waiting for the bus service or
###364 walking down the block.
###366 Sometimes I'd see these and I'd think
###368 well, I could do that.
###373 I don't think I can do better, but I could do
###375 something like that.
###376 And I didn't know a lot of the people in the current scene
###380 that was coming up.
###380 I didn't know people in bands.
###382 So I just made up my own punk bands and put up posters for
###385 like The Twits--
###387 nonexistent bands.
###388 There was no Kinko's then, you had to go to the Rexall and
###392 put a dime in the thing.
###393 Or we'd go to the public library and there's be a
###395 Olivetti machine or a Xerox machine.
###398 You could do whole 'zines at Rexall.
###403 
###410 One of these was--
###411 the people must believe that they are not manipulated in
###413 order for them to be manipulated effectively.
###417 That turned into a compilation album.
###422 THOBEY CAMPION: The name Dead Kennedys I think inspired how
###425 you first reached out to Jello?
###426 WINSTON SMITH: We're kind of at the same age.
###430 He's a few years younger than me.
###433 So I have a vivid memories of JFK's assassination as an
###437 11-year-old, as a teenager, and what that did to the rest
###443 of society.
###446 THOBEY CAMPION: Your career, there's been points where
###449 people will have reacted to your work negatively, and
###455 sometimes extremely negatively.
###457 And I think that the example that yeah, you pointed across
###461 there, I think that the Pat Robertson 700 Club instance
###465 was an interesting one.
###466 WINSTON SMITH: We used a picture I had done a few years
###469 before for a Dead Kennedy's record, it was an EP.
###472 My piece was a cross of American dollars with a Jesus
###477 on a cross.
###478 It was about greed and religion and corruption and
###484 essentially how money controls things, how
###485 people worship money.
###486 It wasn't really very profound.
###489 So we used it for the record.
###491 And then in Great Britain they banned the record cover and
###495 big posters up in the window, like table-size posters, from
###499 record shops.
###500 Because people complained because
###502 they said it was heresy.
###504 Which meant they took the records out of the shops.
###508 And Biafra thought it was horrible.
###510 This is terrible publicity!
###511 And I was going, no, it's great!
###513 There's no such thing as bad publicity!
###515 You should write the cops a check.
###517 You should send them a thank you note.
###520 THOBEY CAMPION: Have you always had a purpose, either
###523 political or social, with your work?
###525 WINSTON SMITH: No.
###527 THOBEY CAMPION: Thank God.
###528 WINSTON SMITH: Yeah.
###528 Sometimes a lot of things I have I'll put together because
###534 they look funny, or interesting, or kind of
###536 intriguing, or enigmatic that way.
###538 THOBEY CAMPION: Some of your work has a definite intent.
###542 One of the pieces that gets brought up a lot is the baby
###547 being fed by the--
###550 WINSTON SMITH: Oh, the bomb.
###551 THOBEY CAMPION: The bomb.
###551 WINSTON SMITH: Baby and the bomb.
###552 Force-fed war.
###553 That was about when Ronald Reagan was
###556 President in '82 or '83.
###557 And he cut-off the school lunch program for children,
###561 which sometimes was the only meal they had in a day, and
###566 give all the money to the Pentagon.
###567 The best thing about that rocket that the baby is being
###570 fed, the real thing on the tail said 666 DBH or some
###576 other code number.
###577 I just had to blackout the code number and the 666 was
###580 already there.
###581 THOBEY CAMPION: What drives you?
###583 Is it frustration that drives you to continue to be working
###587 like 59 years?
###588 WINSTON SMITH: That actually is a good motivator.
###591 A lot of it is just the desire to put what is subconscious
###596 onto paper.
###598 We have a responsibility as artists to express ourselves.
###603 I think.
###604 Even us, we might change our mind 10 or 20 years later, and
###607 go oh, you know, I could be wrong about that.
###610 Now I see it differently.
###611
