1
0:0:23,699 --> 0:0:27,589
The one-inch punch is actually


2
0:0:27,589 --> 0:0:29,409
a method


3
0:0:29,409 --> 0:0:33,55
of chinese Gung Fu of generating power.


4
0:0:33,55 --> 0:0:35,53
One inch punch is a catchy term made,


5
0:0:35,53 --> 0:0:39,32
made up by Bruce Lee which it is actually correct but
really there's all kinds


6
0:0:39,32 --> 0:0:43,69
of short power I mean you can use a
short power palm strike, you can use you


7
0:0:43,69 --> 0:0:46,28
know half-inch punch, or three-inch punch.


8
0:0:46,28 --> 0:0:50,46
Some people call it a trick, could be a
trick it, could be a...


9
0:0:50,46 --> 0:0:57,36
a motion but it does the damage for what
it is, its pretty powerful.


10
0:0:57,36 --> 0:1:2,39
With your wrist joint is the best way to start usually and just flicking it


11
0:1:2,39 --> 0:1:3,78



12
0:1:3,78 --> 0:1:8,8
Giving yourself a flat target and you use bottom three knuckles here
and you just


13
0:1:8,8 --> 0:1:9,27
pop forward


14
0:1:9,27 --> 0:1:13,78
Take your time, no point in rushing it.  Make sure your elbow is in your center and just


15
0:1:13,78 --> 0:1:18,92
slowly over time.  Just keep working on it you
know like a soft pad or a pad of beans.


16
0:1:18,92 --> 0:1:22,77
Usually having a training partner someone hold something for you 


17
0:1:22,77 --> 0:1:25,21
is a good judgement for how much power you're putting out.


18
0:1:25,21 --> 0:1:26,61
And you just...


19
0:1:26,61 --> 0:1:30,2
keep doing it, keep doing it until you feel like


20
0:1:30,2 --> 0:1:34,22
you've got a decent amount of control.  There's a certain amount of time that


21
0:1:34,22 --> 0:1:38,4
wrist strengthening takes place in your training too,
that's a big part of it


22
0:1:38,4 --> 0:1:40,45
has to do with training the form.


23
0:1:40,45 --> 0:1:44,0



24
0:1:44,0 --> 0:1:49,689
The traditional way mostly goes into the internal aspect


25
0:1:49,689 --> 0:1:53,43
the centering of the chi


26
0:1:53,43 --> 0:1:55,64
Chinese medicine


27
0:1:55,64 --> 0:1:59,43
have this concept of chi circulation in the body


28
0:1:59,43 --> 0:2:3,789
and by developing the internal power, the internal chi


29
0:2:3,789 --> 0:2:7,56
you develop the One Inch Punch.  One is first through the practice of


30
0:2:7,56 --> 0:2:9,929
breathing or chi meditation.


31
0:2:9,929 --> 0:2:14,4
through breathing visualization, developing


32
0:2:14,4 --> 0:2:17,199
power centers in certain parts of the
body.


33
0:2:17,199 --> 0:2:19,309
That's the internal approach


34
0:2:19,309 --> 0:2:23,519
The external approach is more muscular
and body alignment,


35
0:2:23,519 --> 0:2:25,0
power base,


36
0:2:25,0 --> 0:2:27,119
torque generation.


37
0:2:27,119 --> 0:2:37,489



38
0:2:37,489 --> 0:2:40,0
A lot of fights starts with finger pointing and a lot of that stuff


39
0:2:40,0 --> 0:2:43,819
and from that finger pointing, which is the closes to someone's


40
0:2:43,819 --> 0:2:46,459
solar plexus, maybe your face


41
0:2:46,459 --> 0:2:49,15
You can generate that One Inch Punch


42
0:2:49,15 --> 0:2:52,0
that will actually, be your winning card.


43
0:2:52,0 --> 0:2:54,79
So let's say the person


44
0:2:54,79 --> 0:2:59,189
attack and the person kind of intercepts my punch


45
0:2:59,189 --> 0:3:0,719
That's where one inch punch comes in


46
0:3:0,719 --> 0:3:13,459
Without pulling back that's from a combative stand point.


47
0:3:13,459 --> 0:3:16,709
If you hit someone with the one inch punch


48
0:3:16,709 --> 0:3:19,29
maybe on the surface you break their ribs.


49
0:3:19,29 --> 0:3:23,79
Internally, you might shock their internal
system.


50
0:3:23,79 --> 0:3:25,689
You can rupture someone's spleen,


51
0:3:25,689 --> 0:3:27,9
you can damage their liver,


52
0:3:27,9 --> 0:3:29,69
you can bruise someone's heart.


53
0:3:29,69 --> 0:3:32,669
Something wrong with one of your vertebrae and someone strikes you really hard the power is going to


54
0:3:32,669 --> 0:3:36,379
try and find a easy way out and it'll go through that injury point.


55
0:3:36,379 --> 0:3:39,329
In extreme cases guys have been known to strike someone in the front and then


56
0:3:39,329 --> 0:3:40,659
it injures their back.


57
0:3:40,659 --> 0:3:43,569
You're hitting his vulnerable point that is also the key too


58
0:3:43,569 --> 0:3:45,769
but obviously if you hit...


59
0:3:45,769 --> 0:3:49,65
the weakest man in the strongest point you're not going to do nay damage because he's


60
0:3:49,65 --> 0:3:54,589
got muscles protection.


61
0:3:54,589 --> 0:3:57,269



62
0:3:57,269 --> 0:3:59,749



63
0:3:59,749 --> 0:4:5,709



64
0:4:5,709 --> 0:4:7,759
In the Chinese movies


65
0:4:7,759 --> 0:4:15,559
the One Inch Punch has always been showcased very well.


66
0:4:15,559 --> 0:4:21,15
However, Kill Bill Vol. 2 the way that it was portrayed


67
0:4:21,15 --> 0:4:26,7
was okay but it just visually it was not pleasing.


68
0:4:26,7 --> 0:4:30,259
Kill Bill the way that the one inch punch was portrayed was...


69
0:4:30,259 --> 0:4:35,749
was, you know, taking your skin off your knuckles and this is how it is


70
0:4:35,749 --> 0:4:36,28
But


71
0:4:36,28 --> 0:4:39,539
it's not about that, it is about the body mass


72
0:4:39,539 --> 0:4:43,65
that moves it is not the callous on your
knuckles that does the damage.


73
0:4:43,65 --> 0:4:51,52



74
0:4:51,52 --> 0:4:56,459
I would continue to teach the one inch punch as part of my curriculum


75
0:4:56,459 --> 0:4:58,719
if the student get that far.


76
0:4:58,719 --> 0:5:0,499
If you learn how to


77
0:5:0,499 --> 0:5:2,58
apply short...


78
0:5:2,58 --> 0:5:7,27
shortest distances with the most powerful
impact you can generate there's a pleasure


79
0:5:7,27 --> 0:5:9,789
because there's a huge discovery about


80
0:5:9,789 --> 0:5:16,31
about one-inch movement.  If you look at
it in that context its got invaluable lessons.


81
0:5:16,31 --> 0:5:18,819
But if you look at it as a one-trick pony...


82
0:5:18,819 --> 0:5:21,37
that's it, that's the end of that show, you know?


83
0:5:21,37 --> 0:5:23,319
I think there's been a slight dip


84
0:5:23,319 --> 0:5:27,989
in martial arts in general.  If you think 150, 200 years ago


85
0:5:27,989 --> 0:5:30,249
people were training this system


86
0:5:30,249 --> 0:5:31,619
because that's all they had.


87
0:5:31,619 --> 0:5:36,39
That was their livelihood, they trained a lot harder than they do today and people tend to be a little lazier.


88
0:5:36,39 --> 0:5:39,2
Maybe that's why there's not that much
interests in martial arts because the kids


89
0:5:39,2 --> 0:5:43,599
would just play video games all night long
why come and train and sweat


90
0:5:43,599 --> 0:5:45,409
and be painful right?


91
0:5:45,409 --> 0:5:49,77
You got to think, we've been doing basically the same stuff until about 100 years ago


92
0:5:49,77 --> 0:5:55,949
until industrial revolution, that changed
everything, people are sitting in front of computers


93
0:5:55,949 --> 0:5:58,46
And we haven't had time to catch up with
that yet


94
0:5:58,46 --> 0:6:2,83
It's a radical change.  So I think the
importance of getting back in touch with your body


95
0:6:2,83 --> 0:6:6,819
... is very high and continue to
become up more on the priority list for


96
0:6:6,819 --> 0:6:10,789
a lot of people so I expect martial arts
to take actually you know


97
0:6:10,789 --> 0:6:14,77
I think there are taking upswing back up.


98
0:6:14,77 --> 0:6:17,719
Because there are systems out there that are
almost being lost


99
0:6:17,719 --> 0:6:20,439
and people don't want her to go away.


100
0:6:20,439 --> 0:6:22,19
I think they're going to get better.


101
0:6:22,19 --> 0:6:26,44
The consequence of one inch punch that happened in Long Beach, for me at least..it's...


102
0:6:26,44 --> 0:6:27,809
it's amazing and I think...


103
0:6:27,809 --> 0:6:30,749
it keeps opening doors


104
0:6:30,749 --> 0:8:30,749
and I think that would be the future of one inch movement or One Inch Punch.
