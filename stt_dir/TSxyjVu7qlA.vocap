###0 The President: It is good to be back in Michigan.
###2 (applause)
###4 How is everybody doing today?
###6 (applause)
###8 Now, let me just start off by saying we have something
###12 in common -- both our teams lost yesterday.
###17 (laughter)
###19 I mean, I would like to come here and talk a little smack
###24 about the Bears, but we didn't quite get it done.
###29 But it is wonderful to be back.
###32 It is good to see everybody in the great state of Michigan.
###36 (applause)
###43 A few people I want to acknowledge -- first of all,
###44 the Mayor of Detroit here -- Dave Bing is in the house.
###47 (applause)
###51 We've got the Redford Supervisor -- Tracey Schultz Kobylarz.
###54 (applause)
###59 We've got some outstanding members of Congress who are
###61 here -- please give them a big round of applause.
###63 (applause)
###70 I want to thank Martin for hosting us.
###73 I want to thank Jeff and Gibby for giving me a great tour of
###77 the factory.
###78 (applause)
###84 I've got to say I love coming to factories.
###88 Audience Member: I love you!
###89 The President: I love you.
###89 (applause)
###91 So in addition to seeing the best workers in the world --
###95 (applause)
###101 -- you've also got all this cool equipment.
###104 (laughter)
###106 I wanted to try out some of the equipment, but Secret Service
###110 wouldn't let me.
###112 (laughter)
###113 They said, you're going to drop something on your head,
###115 hurt yourself.
###117 (laughter)
###118 They were worried I'd mess something up.
###120 And Jeff and Gibby may not admit it, but I think they were pretty
###124 happy the Secret Service wouldn't let me touch
###126 the equipment.
###127 (laughter)
###130 Now, it's been a little over a month since the election came
###135 to an end.
###136 (applause)
###144 So it's now safe for you to turn your televisions back on.
###147 (laughter)
###149 All those scary political ads are off the air.
###153 You can answer your phone again -- nobody is calling you in the
###155 middle of dinner asking for your support.
###160 But, look, I have to admit there's one part of the campaign
###164 that I miss, and that is it is a great excuse for me to get out
###168 of Washington and come to towns like this and talk to the people
###173 who work so hard every day and are looking out for their
###176 families and are in their communities, and just having a
###181 conversation about what kind of country do we want to be; what
###185 kind of country do we want to leave behind for our kids.
###187 Because ultimately, that's what this is about.
###192 And I believe -- and I've been saying this not just for the
###196 last six months or the last year, but ever since I got into
###200 public office -- I believe America only succeeds and
###204 thrives when we've got a strong and growing middle class.
###207 (applause)
###208 That's what I believe.
###210 (applause)
###215 I believe we're at our best when everybody who works hard has a
###218 chance to get ahead; that they can get a job that pays the
###224 bills; that they've got health care that they can count on;
###228 that they can retire with dignity and respect, maybe take
###231 a vacation once in a while -- nothing fancy, just being able
###236 to pack up the kids and go someplace and enjoy time with
###242 people that you love; make sure that your kids can go to a good
###247 school; make sure they can aspire to whatever
###252 they want to be.
###254 That idea is what built America.
###258 That's the idea that built Michigan.
###261 That's the idea that's at the heart of the economic plan I've
###264 been talking about all year long on the campaign trail.
###268 I want to give more Americans the chance to earn the skills
###271 that businesses are looking for right now, and give our kids the
###275 kind of education they need to succeed in the 21st century.
###278 I want to make sure America leads the world in research
###282 and technology and clean energy.
###284 I want to put people back to work rebuilding our roads and
###288 our bridges and our schools.
###289 (applause)
###293 That's how we grow an economy.
###298 I want us to bring down our deficits, but I want to do it
###302 in a balanced, responsible way.
###306 And I want to reward -- I want a tax code that rewards businesses
###311 and manufacturers like Detroit Diesel right here, creating jobs
###316 right here in Redford, right here in Michigan, right here
###319 in the United States of America.
###321 (applause)
###329 That's where we need to go.
###332 That's the country we need to build.
###336 And when it comes to bringing manufacturing back to America --
###339 that's why I'm here today.
###342 Since 1938, Detroit Diesel has been turning out some of the
###347 best engines in the world.
###348 (applause)
###355 Over all those years, generations of Redford workers
###358 have walked through these doors.
###362 Not just to punch a clock.
###363 Not just to pick up a paycheck.
###365 Not just to build an engine.
###368 But to build a middle-class life for their families; to earn a
###372 shot at the American Dream.
###376 For seven and a half decades, through good times and bad,
###380 through revolutions in technology that sent a lot of
###383 good jobs -- manufacturing jobs -- overseas, men and women like
###388 you, your parents, maybe even your grandparents, have done
###392 your part to build up America's manufacturing strength.
###398 That's something you can all be proud of.
###401 And now you're writing a new proud chapter to that history.
###406 Eight years ago, you started building axles here alongside
###409 the engines.
###410 That meant more work.
###411 That meant more jobs.
###412 (applause)
###417 So you started seeing products -- more products stamped with
###421 those three proud words: Made in America.
###425 Today, Daimler is announcing a new $120 million investment
###433 into this plant, creating 115 good, new union jobs building
###439 transmissions and turbochargers right here in Redford --
###442 (applause)
###453 -- 115 good new jobs right here in this plant,
###458 making things happen.
###459 That is great for the plant.
###460 It's great for this community.
###462 But it's also good for American manufacturing.
###466 Soon, you guys will be building all the key parts that go into
###470 powering a heavy-duty truck, all at the same facility.
###475 Nobody else in America is doing that.
###477 Nobody else in North America is doing that.
###481 And by putting everything together in one place,
###485 under one roof, Daimler engineers can design each
###488 part so it works better with the others.
###491 That means greater fuel efficiency for your trucks.
###495 It means greater savings for your customers.
###499 That's a big deal.
###500 And it's just the latest example of Daimler's leadership
###503 on this issue.
###504 Last year, I was proud to have your support when we announced
###507 the first-ever national fuel-efficiency standards for
###510 commercial trucks, which is going to help save consumers
###513 money and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
###516 That's good news.
###518 (applause)
###524 But here's the other reason why what you guys are doing,
###528 what Daimler is doing, is so important.
###530 For a long time, companies, they weren't always making
###533 those kinds of investments here in the United States.
###536 They weren't always investing in American workers.
###540 They certainly weren't willing to make them in
###542 the U.S. auto industry.
###544 Remember, it was just a few years ago that our auto industry
###546 was on the verge of collapse.
###548 GM, Chrysler were all on the brink of failure.
###551 And if they failed, the suppliers and distributors
###554 that get their business from those companies,
###557 they would have died off, too.
###558 Even Ford could have gone down -- production halted.
###562 Factories shuttered.
###565 Once proud companies chopped up and sold off for scraps.
###569 And all of you -- the men and women who built these companies
###572 with your own hands -- would have been hung out to dry.
###575 And everybody in this community that depends on you --
###579 restaurant owners, storekeepers, bartenders --
###585 (laughter and applause)
###594 -- their livelihoods would have been at stake, too.
###598 So I wasn't about to let that happen.
###600 I placed my bet on American workers.
###601 We bet on American ingenuity.
###603 I'd make that same bet any day of the week.
###606 (applause)
###612 Three and a half years later, that bet is paying off.
###615 This industry has added over a quarter of a million new jobs.
###618 Assembly lines are humming again.
###620 The American auto industry is back.
###623 And companies like Daimler know you're still a smart bet.
###627 They could have made their investment somewhere else,
###629 but they didn't.
###630 And if you ask them whether it was a tough call, they'll tell
###632 you it wasn't even close.
###635 So the word is going out all around the world: If you want to
###637 find the best workers in the world, if you want to find the
###641 best factories in the world, if you want to build the best cars
###644 or trucks or any other product in the world, you should invest
###648 in the United States of America.
###650 This is the place to be.
###651 (applause)
###663 See, you're starting to see the competitive balance is tipping a
###666 little bit.
###668 Over the past few years, it's become more expensive to do
###671 business in countries like China.
###674 Our workers have become even more productive.
###677 Our energy costs are starting to go down here in the United
###681 States.
###682 And we still have the largest market.
###685 So when you factor in everything, it makes sense
###687 to invest here, in America.
###689 And that's one of the reasons why American manufacturing is
###692 growing at the fastest pace since the 1990s.
###695 And thanks in part to that boost in manufacturing, four years
###700 after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, our economy is
###704 growing again.
###706 Our businesses have created more than 5.5 million new jobs over
###710 the past 33 months.
###712 So we're making progress.
###716 (applause)
###718 We're moving in the right direction.
###721 We're going forward.
###723 So what we need to do is simple.
###724 We need to keep going.
###727 We need to keep going forward.
###729 We should do everything we can to keep creating good
###732 middle-class jobs that help folks rebuild security for
###735 their families.
###737 (applause)
###743 And we should do everything we can to encourage companies like
###746 Daimler to keep investing in American workers.
###751 And by the way, what we shouldn't do -- I just got
###754 to say this -- what we shouldn't be doing is trying to take away
###757 your rights to bargain for better wages and
###759 working conditions.
###760 (applause)
###762 We shouldn't be doing that.
###763 (applause)
###782 These so-called "right to work" laws, they don't have to do with
###786 economics; they have everything to do with politics.
###788 (applause)
###791 What they're really talking about is giving you the right
###794 to work for less money.
###795 (applause)
###799 You only have to look to Michigan -- where workers were
###802 instrumental in reviving the auto industry -- to see how
###806 unions have helped build not just a stronger middle class
###809 but a stronger America.
###810 (applause)
###813 So folks from our state's capital, all the way to the
###818 nation's capital, they should be focused on the same thing.
###822 They should be working to make sure companies like this
###824 manufacturer is able to make more great products.
###830 That's what they should be focused on.
###832 (applause)
###835 We don't want a race to the bottom.
###840 We want a race to the top.
###842 (applause)
###849 America is not going to compete based on low-skill, low-wage,
###855 no workers' rights.
###857 That's not our competitive advantage.
###859 There's always going to be some other country that can
###863 treat its workers even worse.
###867 Right?
###868 Audience: Right!
###869 The President: What's going to make us succeed is we got the best
###871 workers -- well trained, reliable, productive,
###876 low turnover, healthy.
###880 That's what makes us strong.
###882 And it also is what allows our workers then to buy the products
###887 that we make because they got enough money in their pockets.
###890 (applause)
###898 So we've got to get past this whole situation where
###903 we manufacture crises because of politics.
###907 That actually leads to less certainty, more conflict,
###911 and we can't all focus on coming together to grow.
###915 Audience Member: That's right!
###917 The President: And the same thing -- we're seeing the same
###919 thing in Washington.
###921 I'm sure you've all heard the talk recently about some big
###924 deadlines we're facing in a few weeks when it comes to decisions
###927 on jobs and investment and taxes.
###931 And that debate is going to have a big impact on all of you.
###936 Some of you may know this: If Congress doesn't act soon,
###939 meaning in the next few weeks, starting on January 1st,
###945 everybody is going to see their income taxes go up.
###947 Audience: No!
###949 The President: It's true.
###951 You all don't like that.
###952 Audience: No!
###954 The President: Typical, middle-class family of four will see an income tax hike
###958 of around $2,200.
###961 How many of you can afford to pay another $2,200 in taxes?
###965 Not you?
###966 Audience: No!
###967 The President: I didn't think so.
###969 You can't afford to lose that money.
###972 That's a hit you can't afford to take.
###974 And, by the way, that's not a good hit for businesses, either
###978 -- because if Congress lets middle-class taxes go up,
###982 economists will tell you that means people will spend nearly
###985 $200 billion less than they otherwise would spend.
###990 Consumer spending is going to go down.
###993 That means you've got less customers.
###995 Businesses get fewer profits.
###998 They hire fewer workers.
###1000 You go in a downward spiral.
###1002 Wrong idea.
###1003 Here is the good news: We can solve this problem.
###1008 All Congress needs to do is pass a law that would prevent a tax
###1012 hike on the first $250,000 of everybody's income -- everybody.
###1018 (applause)
###1023 That means 98 percent of Americans -- and probably 100
###1028 percent of you -- (laughter)
###1031 -- 97 percent of small businesses wouldn't see
###1033 their income taxes go up a single dime.
###1037 Even the wealthiest Americans would still get a tax cut on the
###1040 first $250,000 of their income.
###1043 But when they start making a million, or $10 million,
###1048 or $20 million you can afford to pay a little bit more.
###1052 (applause)
###1054 You're not too strapped.
###1060 So Congress can do that right now.
###1063 Everybody says they agree with it.
###1064 Let's get it done.
###1065 (applause)
###1068 So that's the bare minimum.
###1072 That's the bare minimum we should be doing in order to
###1074 the grow the economy.
###1075 But we can do more.
###1077 We can do more than just extend middle-class tax cuts.
###1080 I've said I will work with Republicans on a plan for
###1086 economic growth, job creation, and reducing our deficits.
###1091 And that has some compromise between
###1093 Democrats and Republicans.
###1094 I understand people have a lot of different views.
###1098 I'm willing to compromise a little bit.
###1101 But if we're serious about reducing our deficit,
###1103 we've also got to be serious about investing in the things
###1105 that help us grow and make the middle class strong,
###1108 like education, and research and development,
###1111 and making sure kids can go to college, and rebuilding our
###1114 roads and our infrastructure.
###1116 (applause)
###1117 We've got to do that.
###1119 So when you put it all together, what you need is a package that
###1124 keeps taxes where they are for middle-class families; we make
###1128 some tough spending cuts on things that we don't need;
###1132 and then we ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a slightly
###1134 higher tax rate.
###1136 And that's a principle I won't compromise on, because I'm not
###1140 going to have a situation where the wealthiest among us,
###1144 including folks like me, get to keep all our tax breaks,
###1148 and then we're asking students to pay higher student loans.
###1153 Or suddenly, a school doesn't have schoolbooks because the
###1159 school district couldn't afford it.
###1162 Or some family that has a disabled kid isn't getting
###1165 the help that they need through Medicaid.
###1168 We're not going to do that.
###1169 We're not going to make that tradeoff.
###1170 That's not going to help us to grow.
###1173 Our economic success has never come from the top down; it comes
###1177 from the middle out.
###1178 It comes from the bottom up.
###1179 (applause)
###1180 It comes from folks like you working hard, and if you're
###1185 working hard and you're successful, then you become
###1187 customers and everybody does well.
###1191 Our success as a country in this new century will be defined by
###1195 how well we educate our kids, how well we train our workers,
###1198 how well we invent, how well we innovate, how well we build
###1202 things like cars and engines -- all the things that helped
###1206 create the greatest middle class the world has ever known.
###1209 That's how you bring new jobs back to Detroit.
###1211 That's how you bring good jobs back to America.
###1214 That's what I'm focused on.
###1216 That's what I will stay relentlessly focused on
###1218 going forward.
###1219 (applause)
###1220 Because when we focus on these things -- when we stay true to
###1224 ourselves and our history, there's nothing we can't do.
###1228 (applause)
###1230 And if you don't believe me, you need to come down to this plant
###1233 and see all these outstanding workers.
###1236 In fact, as I was coming over here, I was hearing about a guy
###1240 named Willie.
###1240 (applause)
###1242 Where's Willie?
###1243 There's Willie right here.
###1247 There's Willie.
###1248 (applause)
###1262 Now, in case you haven't heard of him, they actually call him
###1266 "Pretty Willie."
###1266 (laughter)
###1270 Now, I got to say you got to be pretty tough to have a nickname
###1274 like "Pretty Willie."
###1275 (laughter)
###1278 He's tough.
###1280 On Wednesday, Willie will celebrate 60 years working at
###1285 Detroit Diesel -- 60 years.
###1287 (applause)
###1300 Willie started back on December 12, 1952.
###1305 I was not born yet.
###1306 (laughter)
###1309 Wasn't even close to being born.
###1312 He made $1.40 an hour.
###1316 The only time he spent away from this plant was when he
###1319 was serving our country in the Korean War.
###1321 (applause)
###1331 So three generations of Willie's family have passed through
###1333 Detroit Diesel.
###1335 One of his daughters works here with him right now --
###1338 is that right?
###1338 There she is.
###1339 (applause)
###1343 In all his years, Willie has been late to work only once.
###1350 It was back in 1977.
###1351 (laughter)
###1354 It's been so long he can't remember why he was late --
###1357 (laughter and applause)
###1360 -- but we're willing to give him a pass.
###1363 So Willie believes in hard work.
###1366 You don't keep a job for 60 years if you don't work hard.
###1370 Sooner or later, someone is going to fire you if you don't
###1372 work hard.
###1374 He takes pride in being part of something bigger than himself.
###1379 He's committed to family; he's committed to community; he's
###1383 committed to country.
###1384 That's how Willie lives his life.
###1387 That's how all of you live your lives.
###1390 And that makes me hopeful about the future, because you're out
###1395 there fighting every day for a better future for your family
###1398 and your country.
###1400 And when you do that, that means you're creating value all across
###1407 this economy.
###1408 You're inspiring people.
###1410 You're being a good example for your kids.
###1413 That's what makes America great.
###1414 That's what we have to stay focused on.
###1417 And as long as I've got the privilege of serving as your
###1419 President, I'm going to keep fighting for you.
###1422 I'm going to keep fighting for your kids.
###1424 I'm going to keep fighting for an America where anybody, no
###1428 matter who you are, no matter what you look like, no matter
###1431 where you come from, you can make it if you
###1434 try here in America.
###1435 (applause)
###1436 Thank you very much, everybody.
###1437 God bless you.
###1438 (applause)
