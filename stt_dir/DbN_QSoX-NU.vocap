###4 HARRY CHEADLE: When I said I wanted to be in a band, this
###6 wasn't what I had in mind.
###10 I pictured guitar solos and moshing, not waving around a
###13 buzzing wand.
###14 I'm a big fan of the rock and roll lifestyle, and loud angry
###17 music in general.
###18 But my problem was I didn't know how to play an
###20 instrument.
###22 So like a lot of ultra amateur musicians, I turned to the
###25 avant garde electronica scene and called Wadih, my friend
###27 from art school, and asked if I could join his experimental
###30 band, US TM.
###32 He said yes, and that's how I became a wandist.
###36 My name is Harry, and I've been a loser
###38 for most of my life.
###39 I thought I was done with my awkward phase when Vice hired
###41 me to write about politics, culture, and other important
###44 world affairs, which should make me cool.
###46 But it doesn't.
###48 I'm still just a weird kid who creeps people out.
###50 This is All Around Losing with Harry Cheadle.
###52 
###55 [INAUDIBLE]
###55 invited me to his studio to practice with the other
###57 members of his band, Brian and Genevieve before we performed.
###61 [RINGING]
###62 Hey, it's Harry.
###63 I'm here to be in the band.
###65 [BUZZER]
###73 It smells a lot like marijuana.
###76 I don't know how to get in here.
###79 BRIAN CARROLL: Who is it?
###80 HARRY CHEADLE: Hey, it's Harry.
###82 It's Harry.
###83 
###87 When I got inside, there was an art school style dance
###90 party going on that was really sexy.
###93 I remember this kind of party from back in college.
###96 I dusted off my old dance moves--
###98 namely the dance move where I feel really uncomfortable in
###101 my body and stand around hoping that nobody notices me,
###104 or what I'm doing.
###105 
###109 Finally it was time to play with the band.
###111 So I walked back to the studio.
###112 
###122 Before we began, Genevieve had to smear some junk on me.
###125 It was spiritual.
###126 What is this you're putting on my face?
###129 GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: This is going to to help open up
###130 everything from your yoni up to your [INAUDIBLE]
###136 chakra here.
###138 It looks really good on you.
###140 HARRY CHEADLE: Thank you.
###140 I can't see it.
###142 GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: Today we're going to
###143 teach you the wand.
###145 So just think of that like a masculine creative force.
###149 [INAUDIBLE]
###151 You can also play with stopping.
###154 HARRY CHEADLE: Oh.
###155 It's nice you get a breeze, too.
###158 It's a great way to cool off.
###159 GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: It is nice.
###159 HARRY CHEADLE: And an instrument.
###160 Since they're musicians, Wadih and his crew can be as weird
###164 as they want.
###165 They can dress like David Bowie dancers.
###167 They can glue symbolic stickers onto your face.
###169 They can even spray you with rose water
###171 containing moth poop.
###173 So when they hand you a buzzing child's toy and tell
###175 you to dance with it, you dance with it, no
###177 matter who's watching.
###178 
###185 US TM turned out to be really popular band.
###188 I felt like I was cooler and more important than the people
###190 watching me, which I think is what being in a band
###193 is really all about.
###194 
###198 [INAUDIBLE]
###199 fit in with the band.
###200 I want to have the look.
###201 I was wondering if you could take me shopping.
###203 GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: The whole look that we're working on
###204 right now is retard Renaissance.
###206 HARRY CHEADLE: Maybe we could go to a thrift store and you
###207 could make me into a Renaissance retard?
###209 GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: Yes, I would love to do that.
###211 
###217 HARRY CHEADLE: So you're going to make me look as beautiful
###219 as you guys?
###220 GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: Yeah.
###221 We can help you.
###222 We just want you to find your inner--
###224 HARRY CHEADLE: Retard?
###224 GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: By retard we mean your inner child, your
###228 creative unabashed creativity.
###230 HARRY CHEADLE: I want to look like I get laid.
###232 GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: Let's think chain mail.
###233 Let's think--
###235 HARRY CHEADLE: Like that thing?
###236 
###240 WADIH SADER: Are these worn by man?
###242 GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: I don't know.
###243 
###254 Cool.
###255 HARRY CHEADLE: I feel like I looks like a cafeteria worker
###256 with this cap.
###258 GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: Yeah, it's a little lunch lady.
###261 HARRY CHEADLE: Like a lunch lady for a DD and SM club.
###266 So thanks for all your help guys.
###267 I think I got it sorted out.
###269 GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: I'm excited to
###270 see what you choose.
###271 It's going to be a transformation.
###274 [PURRING]
###280 HARRY CHEADLE: Would I be able to pull off the retard
###281 Renaissance look?
###282 Was I weird enough to be in a band like this?
###285 Probably not.
###285 But I was going to give it a shot later that night at a
###288 poetry reading slash performance art thing that
###291 young people with the beards and the
###293 jewelery like to go to.
###295 
###299 We just drank a pint of whisky in the loading dock.
###301 So that's pretty rock and roll.
###304 I got one more thing to wear, and I'm going to
###306 join them in there.
###307 
###321 Was this all an elaborate practical joke?
###323 Why did I have to put all the stuff in my mouth?
###325 GENEVIEVE BELLEVEAU: And roll your eyes up to the ceiling.
###327 
###346 HARRY CHEADLE: Whisky chain mail or not, I
###348 wasn't feeling confident.
###349 Part of the wand had broken, and I wasn't sure it actually
###351 made noise.
###353 
###355 The audience seemed to be taking this really seriously.
###358 Or maybe they were in on the joke.
###359 So I tried to keep a straight face while waving the wand.
###362 
###374 At this point, when Genevieve started sort of writhing on
###376 the floor in her sparkly see-through outfit, and I ran
###379 the wand over her, it felt like a combination of a little
###382 kid playing doctor, and performance art.
###384 But sexier.
###386 
###388 [APPLAUSE]
###391 HARRY CHEADLE: And then it was over.
###392 It wasn't exactly a Springsteen show.
###394 But no-one was laughing or making fun of us.
###396 So I guess it went pretty well.
###399 I learned a lot from performing.
###400 That you don't actually need to play an
###402 instrument to be in a band.
###404 That should've been obvious.
###404 You just need to wave something in
###406 front of your face.
###407 It doesn't really matter what you're doing as long
###408 as you're on stage.
###409 That's the most important thing, just be on stage.
###411 And also dress weird.
###412 Dress in chain mail.
###413 TATIANA: I thought that was really cool.
###414 It was also really sexy.
###416 HARRY CHEADLE: Oh, yeah?
###418 What part was the sexiest part of it.
###419 TATIANA: Just like the undulating
###421 base and the wah-wah.
###423 HARRY CHEADLE: No one had ever called me sexy
###425 or undulating before.
###426 So that was a big step.
###428 Who needs years of practice or training in an instrument?
###430 It turns out all you need to be successful as a musician is
###433 a sparkly wand.
###435 I felt really empowered afterwards, and part of a
###437 scene, just like Yoko Ono.
###439 I was finally a cool band music playing guy, just like I
###443 always wanted.
###445 
###447 So, I told them, keep your chain mail on.
###450 That's a stupid tagline.
###451 All right, Jesus.
###452
