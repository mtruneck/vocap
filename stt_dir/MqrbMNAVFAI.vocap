###70 (Live - Norton Center, Centre College)
###72 ﻿[Martha Raddatz] Good evening,
###73 and welcome to the  first and only vice presidential debate of 2012,
###78 sponsored by the  Commission on Presidential Debates.
###82 I'm Martha Raddatz of ABC News, and I  am honored to moderate this debate
###86 between 2 men who have dedicated  much of their lives to public service.
###91 Tonight's debate is divided between domestic and foreign policy issues.
###96 And  I'm going to move back and forth between foreign and domestic
###99 since  that is what a vice president or president would have to do.
###102 We will have 9 different segments.
###105 At the beginning of each segment, I will ask both candidates a question,
###109 and they will each have 2 minutes to answer.
###111 Then I will encourage a discussion between the candidates with follow-up questions.
###116 By coin toss, it has been determined that Vice President Biden
###120 will be first to answer the opening question.
###123 We have a wonderful audience here at Centre College tonight.
###126 You will no doubt hear their enthusiasm at the end of the debate and right now
###131 as we welcome Vice President Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan. (Applause.)
###149 Very nice to see you. Very nice to see you.
###151 [Joe Biden]: How are you doing?
###161 [Raddatz] OK, you got your little wave to the families in. That's great.
###164 Good evening, gentlemen. It really is an honor to be here with both of you.
###168 I would like to begin with Libya on a rather somber note.
###172 One month ago tonight, on the anniversary of 9/11,
###176 Ambassador Chris Stevens and 3 other brave Americans were killed
###180 in a terrorist attack in Benghazi.
###183 The State Department has now made clear there were no protesters there.
###187 It was a pre-planned assault by heavily armed men.
###191 Wasn't this a massive intelligence failure, Vice President Biden?
###196 [Joe Biden] What it was, it was a tragedy, Martha.
###198 It — Chris Stevens was one of our best. We lost 3 of our other brave Americans.
###203 And I can make absolutely 2 commitments to you and all of the American people tonight:
###207 One, we will find and bring to justice the men who did this.
###213 And secondly, we will get to the bottom of it,
###215 and whatever — wherever the facts lead us,
###218 wherever they lead us, we will make clear to the American public,
###221 because whatever mistakes were made will not be made again.
###224 When you're looking at a president, Martha,
###226 it seems to me that you should take a look at his most important responsibility.
###230 That's carrying forward the national security of the country.
###234 And the best way to do that is take a look at how he's handled he issues of the day.
###237 On Iraq, the president said he would end the war.
###241 Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake;
###243 we should have left 30 — that he ended it —
###246 Governor Romney said that was a tragic mistake; we should have left 30,000 troops there.
###250 With regard to Afghanistan, he said he will end the war in 2014.
###254 Governor Romney said we should not set a date, number 1,
###257 and number 2, with regard to 2014, it depends.
###261 When it came to Osama bin Laden, the president,
###264 the first day in office — I was sitting with him in the Oval Office.
###268 He called in the CIA and signed an order saying,
###270 my highest priority is to get bin Laden.
###272 Prior to the election, prior to the — him being sworn in,
###277 Governor Romney was asked a question about how he would proceed.
###279 He said, I wouldn't move heaven and earth to get bin Laden.
###282 He didn't understand it was more than about taking a — a murderer off the battlefield;
###287 it was about restoring America's heart and letting terrorists around the world know
###291 if you do harm to America, we will track you to the gates of hell, if need be.
###296 And lastly, the — the president of the United States has —
###300 has led with a steady hand and clear vision.
###304 Governor Romney, the opposite. The last thing we need now is another war.
###311 [Raddatz] Congressman Ryan.
###312 [Paul Ryan]: [Sighs.] We mourn the loss of these 4 Americans who were murdered.
###317 When you take a look at what has happened just in the last few weeks,
###320 they sent the U.N. ambassador out to say
###323 that this was because of a protest and a YouTube video.
###326 It took the president 2 weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack.
###332 He went to the U.N., and in his speech at the U.N.
###335 he said 5 times — he talked about the YouTube video.
###337 Look, if we are hit by terrorists, we're going to call it for what it is, a terrorist attack.
###344 Our ambassador in Paris has a Marine detachment guarding him.
###348 Shouldn't we have a Marine detachment guarding our ambassador in Benghazi,
###353 a place where we knew that there was an al-Qaida cell with arms?
###358 This is becoming more troubling by the day.
###362 They first blamed the YouTube video;
###363 now they're trying to blame the Romney-Ryan ticket for making this an issue.
###368 And with respect to Iraq, we had the same position before the withdrawal,
###373 which was we agreed with the Obama administration:
###376 Let's have a Status of Forces Agreement to make sure that we secure our gains.
###380 The vice president was put in charge of those negotiations by President Obama,
###384 and they failed to get the agreement.
###386 We don't have a Status of Forces Agreement because they failed to get one.
###390 That's what we are talking about.
###392 And when it comes to our veterans,
###394 we owe them a great debt of gratitude for what they've done for us,
###397 including your son Beau.
###400 But we also want to make sure that we don't lose the things we fought so hard to get.
###404 And with respect to Afghanistan and the 2014 deadline,
###407 we agree with a 2014 transition.
###409 But what we also want to do is make sure that we're not projecting weakness abroad,
###413 and that's what's happening here.
###414 This Benghazi issue would be a tragedy in and of itself.
###419 But unfortunately it's indicative of a broader problem,
###422 and that is what we are watching on our TV screens
###425 is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy,
###427 which is making the world more — more chaotic and us less safe.
###432 [Raddatz]: I just want to talk to you about right in the middle of the crisis.
###435 Governor Romney — and you're talking about this again tonight —
###439 talked about the weakness, talked about apologies from the Obama administration.
###444 Was that really appropriate right in the middle of the crisis?
###448 [Ryan] On that same day, the Obama administration had the exact same position.
###452 Let's recall that they disavowed their own statement
###455 that they had put out earlier in the day in Cairo.
###458 So we had the same position, but we will —
###459 it's never to early to speak out for our values.
###463 We should have spoken out right away when the Green Revolution was up and starting,
###467 when the mullahs in Iran were attacking their people.
###470 We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer
###472 when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people.
###476 We should always stand up for peace, for democracy, for individual rights,
###482 and we should not be imposing these devastating defense cuts,
###485 because what that does when we equivocate on our values,
###489 when we show that we're cutting our own defense — [Biden] Am I going to get to say anything here?
###491 [Ryan] — it makes us more weak.
###492 It projects weakness, and when we look weak,
###494 our adversaries are much more willing to test us,
###496 they're more brazen in their attacks, and our allies are less willing to —
###499 [Biden] With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey. In fact —
###502 [Raddatz] And why is that so?
###503 [Biden] Because not a single thing he said is accurate. First of all —
###506 [Raddatz] Be specific.
###507 [Biden] I will be very specific.
###508 Number one, the — this lecture on embassy security —
###512 the congressman here cut embassy security in his budget
###516 by $300 million below what we asked for, number 1.
###521 So much for the embassy security piece.
###523 Number 2, Governor Romney, before he knew the facts,
###527 before he even knew that our ambassador was killed,
###529 he was out making a political statement which was panned by the media around the world.
###535 And this talk about this — this weakness, I —
###539 I don't understand what my friend's talking about here.
###542 We — this is a president who's gone out and done everything he has said he was going to do.
###547 This is the guy who's repaired our alliances so the rest of the world follows us again.
###551 This is the guy who brought the entire world, including Russia and China,
###555 to bring about the most devastating, most devastating
###560 — the most devastating efforts on Iran to make sure that they in fact stop with their —
###567 look, I — I — I just — I mean, these guys bet against America all the time.
###571 [Raddatz] Can we talk about — [Biden] Yeah, sure.
###572 [Raddatz]  let me go back to Libya.
###574 [Biden] What were you first told about the attack?
###578 Why were people talking about protests?
###581 When people in the consulate first saw armed men attacking with guns,
###587 there were no protesters. [Biden] Because...
###589 [Raddatz] Why did that go on for weeks? [Biden] Because that's exactly what we were told —
###592 [Raddatz] By who? [Biden] — by the intelligence community. The intelligence community told us that.
###596 As they learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed their assessment.
###601 That's why there's also an investigation headed by Tom Pickering,
###604 a leading diplomat in the — from the Reagan years,
###607 who is doing an investigation as to whether or not there were any lapses,
###610 what the lapses were, so that they will never happen again. But —
###613 [Raddatz]  And they wanted more security there.
###615 [Biden] Well, we weren't told they wanted more security again.
###618 We did not know they wanted more security again.
###620 And by the way, at the time we were told exactly —
###624 we said exactly what the intelligence community told us that they knew.
###628 That was the assessment.
###630 And as the intelligence community changed their view,
###632 we made it clear they changed their view.
###634 That's why I said, we will get to the bottom of this.
###637 You know, usually when there's a crisis, we pull together.
###639 We pull together as a nation.
###642 But as I said, even before we knew what happened to the ambassador,
###645 the Governor was holding a press conference — was holding a press conference.
###648 That's not presidential leadership.
###650 [Raddatz] Mr. Ryan, I want to ask you about —
###653 the Romney campaign talks a lot about no apologies.
###656 He has a book called No Apologies.
###658 Should the U.S. have apologized for Americans burning Qurans in Afghanistan?
###663 Should the U.S. apologize for U.S. Marines urinating on Taliban corpses?
###669 [Ryan] Oh, gosh, yes. Urinating on Taliban corpses? What we should not apologize for —
###674 [Raddatz] Burning Qurans immediately.
###675 [Ryan] What — what we should not be apologizing for are standing up for our values.
###679 What we should not be doing is saying to the Egyptian people,
###682 while Mubarak is cracking down on them,
###685 that he's a good guy and then the next week say he ought to go.
###688 What we should not be doing is rejecting claims for
###691 — calls for more security in our barracks, in our Marine —
###695 we need Marines in Benghazi
###698 when the commander on the ground says we need more forces for security.
###701 There were requests for extra security. Those requests were not honored.
###704 Look, this was the anniversary of 9/11.
###708 It was Libya, a country we knew we had al-Qaida cells there.
###713 As we know, al-Qaida and its affiliates are on the rise in Northern Africa.
###716 And we did not give our ambassador in Benghazi a Marine detachment?
###722 Of course there is an investigation so we can make sure that this never happens again.
###725 But when it comes to speaking up for our values, we should not apologize for those.
###730 Here is the problem.
###731 Look at all the various issues out there and that's unraveling before our eyes.
###735 The vice president talks about sanctions on Iran.
###737 They got — we've had 4 —
###739 [Raddatz]  Let's move to Iran.
###740 I'd actually like to move to Iran because there is really no bigger national security —
###744 [Ryan] Absolutely.
###745 [Raddatz] — this country is facing.
###746 Both President Obama and Governor Romney have said
###749 they will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, even if that means military action.
###755 Last week former Defense Secretary Bob Gates said
###758 a strike on Iran's facilities would not work and,
###761 quote, could prove catastrophic, haunting us for generations.
###766 Can the 2 of you be absolutely clear and specific to the American people
###771 how effective would a military strike be? Congressman Ryan.
###776 [Ryan] We cannot allow Iran to gain a nuclear weapons capability.
###780 Now, let's take a look at where we've gone — come from.
###784 When Barack Obama was elected,
###786 they had enough fissile material, nuclear material, to make 1 bomb.
###790 Now they have enough for 5.
###791 They're racing toward a nuclear weapon.
###793 They're 4 years closer toward a nuclear weapons capability.
###796 We've had 4 different sanctions at the U.N. on Iran,
###798 3 from the Bush administration, 1 here.
###801 And the only reason we got it is because Russia watered it down
###803 and prevented the — the sanctions from hitting the central bank.
###807 Mitt Romney proposed these sanctions in 2007.
###810 In Congress, I've been fighting for these sanctions since 2009.
###813 The administration was blocking us every step of the way.
###815 Only because we had strong bipartisan support for these tough sanctions
###819 were we able to overrule their objections and put them in spite of the administration.
###823 Imagine what would have happened if we had these sanctions in place earlier.
###827 You think Iran's not brazen? Look at what they're doing.
###830 They're stepping up their terrorist attacks.
###832 They tried a terrorist attack in the United States last year
###835 when they tried to blow up the Saudi ambassador at a restaurant in Washington, D.C.
###839 And talk about credibility.
###841 When this administration says that all options are on the table,
###844 they send out senior administration officials that send all these mixed signals.
###848 And so in order solve this peacefully, which is everybody's goal,
###853 you have to have the ayatollahs change their minds.
###856 Look at where they are. They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon.
###860 It's because this administration has no credibility on this issue.
###863 It's because this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions,
###867 tried to stop us from putting the tough sanctions in place.
###869 Now we have them in place because of Congress.
###871 They say the military option's on the table but it's not being viewed as credible,
###875 and the key is to do this peacefully, is to make sure that we have credibility.
###880 Under a Romney administration, we will have credibility on this issue.
###884 [Raddatz]  Vice President Biden.
###885 [Biden] It's incredible. (Chuckles.)
###886 Look, imagine had we let the Republican Congress work out the sanctions.
###892 You think there's any possibility the entire world would have joined us,
###897 Russia and China, all of our allies?
###900 These are the most crippling sanctions in the history of sanctions, period, period.
###906 When Governor Romney's asked about it, he said, we got to keep these sanctions.
###910 When you say, well, you're talking about doing more,
###912 what are you — are you — you're going to go to war? Is that you want to do now?
###914 [Ryan]  We want to prevent war!
###915 [Biden]  We have — and I — the interesting thing is, how they're going to prevent war.
###918 How are they going to prevent war if they say that there's nothing more that we
###922 — that they say we should do than what we've already done, number 1?
###926 And number 2, with regard to the ability of the United States to take action militarily,
###931 it is — it is not in my purview to talk about classified information.
###936 But we feel quite confident we could deal a serious blow to the Iranians.
###941 But number 2, the Iranians are — the Israelis and the United States —
###946 our military and intelligence communities are absolutely the same exact place
###950 in terms of how close — how close the Iranians are to getting a nuclear weapon.
###957 They are a good way away.
###959 There is no difference between our view and theirs.
###962 When my friend talks about fissile material,
###965 they have to take this highly enriched uranium, get it from 20% up.
###970 Then they have to be able to have something to put it in.
###973 There is no weapon that the Iranians have at this point.
###977 Both the Israelis and we know we'll know if they start the process of building a weapon.
###982 So all this bluster I keep hearing, all this loose talk — what are they talking about?
###989 Are you talking about to be more credible?
###991 But what — what more can the president do?
###993 Stand before the United Nations, tell the whole world,
###995 directly communicate to the ayatollah:
###997 We will not let them acquire a nuclear weapon, period,
###1003 unless he's talking about going to war.
###1004 [Ryan]  Martha, let's just —
###1006 [Raddatz] Congressman Ryan.
###1007 [Ryan]  — let's look at this from the view of the ayatollahs. What do they see?
###1011 They see this administration trying to water down sanctions in Congress for over 2 years.
###1016 They're moving faster toward a nuclear weapon;
###1019 they're spinning the centrifuges faster.
###1021 They see us saying, when we come into the administration,
###1024 when they're sworn in, we need more space with our ally Israel.
###1028 They see President Obama in New York City the same day Bibi Netanyahu is,
###1033 and he's — instead of meeting with him goes on a — on a daily talk show.
###1036 They see — when we say that these options are on the table,
###1041 the Secretary of defense walked them back.
###1044 They are not changing their mind.
###1046 That's what we have to do, is change their mind
###1049 so they stop pursuing nuclear weapons, and they're going faster.
###1051 [Raddatz] How will you do it so quickly?
###1052 Look, you both saw Benjamin Netanyahu hold up that picture of a bomb
###1057 with the red line and talking about the red line being in spring.
###1062 So can you solve this — if the Romney-Ryan ticket is elected,
###1068 can you solve this in 2 months before spring and avoid nuclear — nuclear --
###1074 [Ryan] We — we can debate a timeline.
###1075 [Raddatz] (Inaudible.)
###1076 [Ryan] We can debate the timeline,
###1076 whether there's — it's that short a time or longer.
###1078 I — I agree that it's probably longer.
###1080 Number 2, it's all about credibility.
###1083 [Raddatz] You don't agree with that bomb and what the Israelis —
###1084 [Biden] No, look — (inaudible) —
###1085 [Ryan] (Inaudible) — look, we — we both agree —
###1086 [Raddatz] Vice President Biden.
###1087 [Ryan I don't want to go into classified stuff,
###1088 but we both agree that to do this peacefully,
###1092 you've got to get them to change their minds.
###1094 They're not changing their minds, and look at what this administration does —
###1096 [Raddatz] But what do you do — (inaudible) —
###1098 [Biden] Let me tell you what the ayatollah sees.
###1099 [Ryan] You have to have credibility.
###1099 [Biden] The ayatollah sees his economy being crippled.
###1101 The ayatollah sees that there are 50% fewer exports of oil.
###1107 He sees the currency going into the tank.
###1110 He sees the economy going into free fall,
###1113 and he sees the world for the first time totally united
###1116 in opposition to him getting a nuclear weapon.
###1119 Now, with regard to Bibi, he's been my friend for 39 years.
###1122 The president has met with Bibi a dozen times.
###1125 He's spoken to Bibi Netanyahu as much as he's spoken to anybody.
###1128 The idea that we're not — I was in a — just before he went to the U.N.,
###1132 I was in a conference call with the — with the president,
###1135 with him talking to Bibi, for well over an hour
###1138 in — in — in — in — in stark relief and detail about what was going on.
###1143 This is a bunch of stuff. Look, here's the deal —
###1145 [Raddatz] What does that mean, "a bunch of stuff"?
###1147 [Biden] Well, it means it's simply inaccurate.
###1148 [Ryan] It's Irish. (Chuckles.)
###1149 [Biden] It is. (Laughter.) The Irish call it malarkey.
###1153 [Raddatz] Thanks for the translation. OK.
###1154 [Biden] No, the Irish call it malarkey. (Laughter.)
###1155 But last thing: the secretary of defense has made it absolutely clear.
###1160 He didn't walk anything back.
###1160 We will not allow the Iranians to get a nuclear weapon.
###1166 What Bibi held up there was when they get to the point
###1169 where they can enrich uranium enough to put into a weapon,
###1173 they don't have a weapon to put it into.
###1176 Let's all calm down a little bit here.
###1179 Iran is more isolated today than when we took office.
###1182 It was on the ascendancy when we took office. It is totally isolated.
###1187 [Raddatz] Congressman Ryan —
###1188 [Biden] I don't know what world you guys are in.
###1189 [Raddatz] Congressman Ryan —
###1190 [Ryan] Thank — thank heavens we have these sanctions in place.
###1191 It's in spite of their opposition.
###1193 [Biden] (Chuckles.) Oh, God.
###1194 [Ryan] They have given 20 waivers to this sanction.
###1196 And all I have to point to are the results.
###1199 They're 4 years closer toward a nuclear weapon.
###1202 I think that case speaks for itself.
###1203 [Raddatz] Can you tell the American people what's worse than —
###1205 [Biden] By the way, they're — no,
###1206 no, they are not 4 years closer to a nuclear weapon.
###1207 [Raddatz] — another war in the Middle East or —
###1208 [Biden] They're — they're closer to being able to get enough fissile material
###1212 to put in a weapon if they had a weapon. But —
###1215 [Raddatz] You're acting a little bit like they don't want one, though.
###1217 [Biden] Oh, I didn't say — no, I'm not saying that's - facts matter, Martha.
###1220 You're a foreign policy expert. Facts matter.
###1223 All this loose talk about them
###1225 — all they have to do is get to — enrich uranium in a certain amount
###1229 and they have a weapon — not true. Not true.
###1232 They are more — and if we ever have to take action, unlike where we took office,
###1238 we will have the world behind us, and that matters. That matters.
###1243 [Raddatz] What about Bob Gates' statement? Let me read that again:
###1247 "... could prove catastrophic, haunting us for generations."
###1251 [Biden] He is right. It could prove catastrophic
###1254 if we do — we do it with — (inaudible) —
###1255 [Raddatz] Congressman Ryan?
###1255 [Ryan] And what it does is it — and it undermines our credibility
###1258 by backing up the point when we make it that all options are on the table.
###1262 That's the point.
###1263 The ayatollahs see these kinds of statements,
###1266 and they think, I'm going to get a nuclear weapon.
###1269 When — when we see the kind of equivocation that took place
###1273 because this administration wanted a precondition policy —
###1277 so when the Green Revolution started up, they were silent for 9 days.
###1281 When they see us putting des... desperate -  when they see us putting daylight
###1285 between ourselves and our allies in Israel, that gives them encouragement.
###1290 When they see Russia watering down any further sanctions
###1294 — and the only reason we got a U.N. sanction is because Russia watered it down
###1297 and prevented these sanctions from being sanctions in the first place.
###1299 So when they see this kind of activity, they are encouraged to continue,
###1304 and that's the problem.
###1305 [Biden] Martha, let me tell you what Russia's — (inaudible) —
###1306 [Raddatz] What — let me ask you what's worse:
###1307 war in the Middle East, another war in the Middle East, or a nuclear-armed Iran?
###1312 [Ryan] I'll tell you what's worse - I'll tell you what's worse.
###1312 [Raddatz] Quickly.
###1313 [Ryan] A nuclear-armed Iran,
###1315 which triggers a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.
###1317 This is the world's largest sponsor of — of terrorism.
###1320 They've dedicated themselves —
###1321 [Biden] That's the only thing my —
###1322 [Ryan] — to wiping an entire country off the map.
###1323 They call us the Great Satan.
###1325 And if they get nuclear weapons,
###1327 other people in the neighborhood will pursue their nuclear weapons as well.
###1330 [Raddatz] Vice President Biden.
###1331 [Ryan] We can't live with that.
###1332 [Biden] War should always be the absolute last resort.
###1337 That's why these crippling sanctions,
###1340 which Bibi Netanyahu says we should continue
###1342 — which, if I'm not mistaken, Governor Romney says we — we should continue.
###1347 If I — I may be mistaken; he changes his mind so often, I could be wrong.
###1351 But the fact of the matter is, he says they're working.
###1355 And the fact is that they are being crippled by them.
###1359 And we've made it clear, big nations can't bluff.
###1362 This president doesn't bluff.
###1364 [Raddatz] Gentlemen, I want to bring the conversation
###1366 to a different kind of national security issue, the state of our economy.
###1370 The number 1 issue here at home is jobs.
###1374 The percentage of unemployed just fell below 8%
###1378 for the first time in 43 months.
###1381 The Obama administration had projected that it would fall below 6% now,
###1386 after the addition of close to a trillion dollars in stimulus money.
###1390 So will both of you level with the American people?
###1393 Can you get unemployment to under 6%, and how long will it take?
###1398 [Biden] I don't know how long it will takw
###1399 [Raddatz] Vice President Biden.
###1400 [Biden] We can and we will get it under 6%.
###1402 Let's look at the — let's take a look at the facts.
###1404 Let's look at where we were when we came to office.
###1407 The economy was in free fall.
###1409 We had — the Great Recession hit.
###1412 9 million people lost their job, 1.7 — $1.6 trillion in wealth lost in equity in your homes, in retirement accounts from the middle class.
###1423 We knew we had to act for the middle class.
###1425 We immediately went out and rescued General Motors.
###1428 We went ahead and made sure that we cut taxes for the middle class.
###1431 And in addition to that, when that — and when that occurred,
###1434 what did Romney do? Romney said, no, let Detroit go bankrupt.
###1438 We moved in and helped people refinance their homes.
###1441 Governor Romney said, no, let foreclosures hit the bottom.
###1444 But it shouldn't be surprising for a guy who says
###1446 47% of the American people
###1448 are unwilling to take responsibility for their own lives.
###1451 My friend recently, in a speech in Washington,
###1453 said 30% of the American people are takers.
###1456 These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors.
###1461 They pay more effective tax than Governor Romney pays in his federal income tax.
###1465 They are elderly people who in fact are living off of Social Security.
###1468 They are veterans and people fighting in Afghanistan right now who are,
###1472 quote, not paying any taxes.
###1474 I've had it up to here with this notion that 47%
###1478 — it's about time they take some responsibility here.
###1481 And instead of signing pledges to Grover Norquist
###1483 not to ask the wealthiest among us to contribute to bring back the middle class,
###1488 they should be signing a pledge saying to the middle class,
###1491 we're going to level the playing field.
###1493 We're going to give you a fair shot again.
###1495 We are going to not repeat the mistakes we made in the past
###1499 by having a different set of rules for Wall Street and Main Street,
###1503 making sure that we continue to hemorrhage these tax cuts for the superwealthy.
###1507 They're pushing the continuation of a tax cut
###1510 that will give an additional $500 billion in tax cuts to 120,000 families.
###1517 And they're holding hostage the middle-class tax cut because they say,
###1522 we won't pass — we won't continue the middle-class tax cut
###1525 unless you give the tax cut for the superwealthy.
###1528 It's about time they take some responsibility.
###1531 [Raddatz] Mr. Ryan.
###1531 [Ryan] Joe and I are from similar towns.
###1534 He's from Scranton, Pennsylvania.
###1536 I'm from Janesville, Wisconsin.
###1537 You know what the unemployment rate in Scranton is today?
###1540 [Biden] I sure do.
###1541 [Ryan] It's 10%,
###1542 [Biden] Yeah.
###1542 [Ryan]: You know what it was the day you guys came in?
###1544 [Biden] [Inaudible]
###1544 [Ryan] 8.5%
###1545 [Biden] Yeah.
###1546 [Ryan] That's how it's going all around America.
###1547 Look —
###1548 [Biden] You don't read the statistics. That's not "how it's going."
###1550 It's going down.
###1551 [Raddatz] (Inaudible) — 2-minute answer, please.
###1552 [Ryan] Look — (chuckles) — did they come in and inherit a tough situation? Absolutely.
###1558 [Biden] (Chuckles.)
###1559 [Ryan] But we're going in the wrong direction!
###1561 Look at where we are. The economy is barely limping along.
###1565 It's growing at 1.3%.
###1566 That's slower than it grew last year,
###1568 and last year was slower than the year before.
###1570 Job growth in September was slower than it was in August,
###1574 and August was slower than it was in July.
###1576 We're heading in the wrong direction.
###1578 23 million Americans are struggling for work today.
###1582 15% of Americans are living in poverty today.
###1586 This is not what a real recovery looks like.
###1589 We need real reforms for a real recovery,
###1591 and that's exactly what Mitt Romney and I are proposing.
###1594 It's 5-Point plan.
###1596 Get America energy-independent in North America by the end of the decade.
###1599 Help people who are hurting get the skills they need to get the jobs they want.
###1603 Get this deficit and debt under control to prevent a debt crisis.
###1606 Make trade work for America so we can make more things in America
###1609 and sell them overseas and champion small businesses.
###1612 Don't raise taxes on small businesses, because they're our job creators.
###1615 He talks about Detroit. Mitt Romney's a car guy.
###1619 They keep misquoting him, but let me tell you about the Mitt Romney I know.
###1623 This is a guy who
###1625 — I was talking to a family in Northborough, Massachusetts the other day,
###1629 Cheryl and Mark Nixon (sp).
###1631 Their kids were hit in a car crash, 4 of them
###1634 — 2 of them, Rob (sp) and Reid (sp), were paralyzed.
###1637 The Romneys didn't know them. They went to the same church.
###1639 They never met before.
###1640 Mitt asked if he could come over on Christmas.
###1643 He brought his boys, his wife and gifts.
###1647 Later on he said, I know you're struggling, Mark (sp).
###1650 Don't worry about their college; I'll pay for it.
###1652 When Mark (sp) told me this story
###1654 — because you know what, Mitt Romney doesn't tell these stories.
###1656 The Nixons told this story.
###1657 When he told me this story, he said it wasn't the help — the cash help;
###1661 it's that he gave his time, and he has consistently.
###1664 This is a man who gave 30% of his income to charity,
###1668 more than the 2 of us combined.
###1669 Mitt Romney's a good man.
###1671 He cares about 100% of Americans in this country.
###1675 And with respect to that quote,
###1676 I think the vice president very well knows
###1679 that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way. (Laughter.)
###1685 [Biden] But I always say what I mean.
###1687 [Raddatz] You —
###1689 [Biden] And so does Romney.
###1690 [Ryan] We want everybody to succeed.
###1691 We want to get people out of poverty, in the middle class,
###1694 on to lives of self-sufficiency.
###1695 We believe in opportunity and upward mobility.
###1698 That's what we're going to push for in a Romney administration.
###1700 [Raddatz] Vice President?
###1701 [Biden] Look —
###1701 [Raddatz] I have a feeling you have a few things to say here. (Laughter.)
###1703 [Biden] (Chuckles.) The idea, if you heard that
###1706 — that little soliloquy on 47%, and you think he just made a mistake,
###1711 then I think you're — I — I — I — I — I got a bridge to sell you.
###1716 Look, I don't doubt his personal generosity, and I understand what it's like.
###1722 When I was a little younger than the congressman,
###1725 my wife was in an accident, killed my daughter and my wife,
###1731 and my 2 sons survived.
###1733 I have sat in the homes of many people who've gone through what I get through
###1737 because the one thing you can give people solace
###1739 is to know they know you've been through it, that they can make it.
###1744 So I don't doubt his personal commitment to individuals.
###1748 But you know what? I know he had no commitment to the automobile industry.
###1753 He just let — he said, let it go bankrupt, period, let it drop out.
###1758 All this talk — we saved a million jobs.
###1760 200 thousand people are working today.
###1763 And I have never met 2 guys who are more down on America across the board.
###1766 We're told everything is going bad.
###1768 We have 5.2 million new jobs, private sector jobs.
###1772 We need more, but 5.2 million — if they'd get out of the way,
###1776 if they get out of the way and let us pass the tax cut for the middle class,
###1780 make it permanent,
###1781 if they get out of the way and pass the — pass the jobs bill,
###1784 if they get out of the way and let us allow 14 million people
###1786 who are struggling to stay in their homes because their mortgages are upside-down,
###1790 but they never missed a mortgage payment — just get out of the way.
###1793 Stop talking about how you care about people.
###1796 Show me something. Show me a policy.
###1799 Show me a policy where you take responsibility.
###1803 And by the way, they talk about this Great Recession
###1805 as if it fell out of the sky, like, oh my goodness, where did it come from?
###1809 It came from this man voting to put 2 wars in a credit card,
###1814 to at the same time put a prescription drug benefit on the credit card,
###1817 a trillion- dollar tax cut for a — very wealthy.
###1821 I was there. I voted against him. I said, no, we can't afford that.
###1824 And now all of a sudden these guys are so seized with a concern about the debt
###1830 that they created —
###1831 [Raddatz] Congressman Ryan.
###1833 [Ryan] Let's not forget that they came in with one-party control.
###1838 When Barack Obama was elected, his party controlled everything.
###1840 They had the ability to do everything of their choosing,
###1843 and look at where we are right now.
###1845 They passed a stimulus, the idea that we could borrow $831 billion,
###1850 spend it on all these special interest groups
###1852 and that it would work out just fine,
###1853 that unemployment would never get to 8%.
###1856 It went up above 8% for 43 months.
###1858 They said that right now, if we just pass this stimulus,
###1860 the economy would grow at 4%. It's growing at 1.3 (%).
###1864 [Raddatz]: When could you get it below 6%?
###1866 [Ryan] That's what our entire premise of our pro-growth plan
###1869 for a stronger middle class is all about:
###1871 getting the economy growing at 4%,
###1873 creating 12 million jobs over the next 4 years.
###1875 Look at just the $90 billion in stimulus,
###1878 and — and the vice president was in charge of overseeing this,
###1880 $90 billion in green pork to campaign contributors and special interest groups.
###1885 There are just at the Department of Energy over 100 criminal investigations
###1890 that have been launched into just how —
###1892 [Biden] Martha —
###1892 [Ryan] — stimulus — (inaudible) — are being spent —
###1893 [Raddatz] Go ahead.
###1893 Go ahead, Vice —
###1894 [Biden] Martha, look. His colleague runs an investigative committee —
###1897 [Ryan] Crony capitalism — (inaudible).
###1898 [Biden] — spent months and months and months going into this —
###1899 [Ryan] This is the — this is the inspector general.
###1902 [Biden] — months and months.
###1903 They found no evidence of cronyism. And I love my friend here.
###1907 I — I'm not allowed to show letters, but go on our website:
###1910 He sent me 2 letters saying, by the way,
###1913 can you send me some stimulus money for companies here in the state of Wisconsin?
###1919 We sent millions of dollars. You know why he said he needed —
###1921 [Raddatz] You did ask for stimulus money, correct?
###1923 [Biden] Sure he did. By the way — (inaudible) —
###1923 [Ryan] On 2 occasions, we — we — we advocated for constituents who were applying for grants.
###1928 [Biden] (Chuckles.)
###1929 [Ryan] That's what we do. We do that for all constituents who are — (inaudible) — for grants.
###1931 [Biden] I love that. I love that.
###1932 This is such a bad program, and he writes me a letter saying
###1936 — writes the Department of Energy a letter saying,
###1937 the reason we need this stimulus — it will create growth and jobs.
###1941 He — his words.
###1943 And now he's sitting here looking at me — and by the way, that program
###1947 — again, investigated — what the Congress said was, it was a model:
###1952 less than 4/10 of 1% waste or fraud in the program.
###1957 And all this talk about cronyism — they investigated and investigated;
###1961 did not find one single piece of evidence.
###1963 I wish he would just tell — be a little more candid.
###1966 [Ryan] Was it a good idea to spend taxpayer dollars on electric cars in Finland or on windmills in China?
###1973 [Biden] Look —
###1974 [Ryan] Was it a good idea to borrow all this money from countries like China —
###1977 [Biden] (Chuckles.)
###1978 [Ryan] — and spend it on all these various different interest groups?
###1980 [Biden] Let me tell you it was a good idea. It was a good idea
###1982 — Moody's and others said that this was exactly what we needed
###1985 that stopped us from going off the cliff.
###1987 It set the conditions to be able to grow again.
###1989 We have — in fact, 4% of those green jobs didn't go under
###1993 — or went — went — went under — didn't work.
###1995 It's a better batting average than investment bankers have.
###1998 They have about a 40% — (inaudible) — loss.
###2000 [Ryan] Where are the 5 million green jobs that were being promised —
###2002 [Raddatz] I want to move on here to Medicare and entitlements.
###2005 I think we've gone over this quite enough. And both —
###2008 [Biden] And by the way, any letter you send me I'll entertain.
###2010 [Ryan] I appreciate that, Joe. (Laughter.)
###2013 [Raddatz] Let's talk about Medicare and entitlements.
###2015 Both Medicare and Social Security are going broke
###2018 and taking a larger share of the budget in the process.
###2021 Will benefits for Americans under these programs
###2024 have to change for the programs to survive, Mr. Ryan?
###2029 [Ryan] Absolutely. Medicare and Social Security are going bankrupt.
###2031 These are indisputable facts.
###2032 Look, when I look at these programs, we've all had tragedies in our lives.
###2037 I think about what they've done for my own family.
###2040 My mom and I had my grandmother move in with us who was facing Alzheimer's.
###2044 Medicare was there for her, just like it's there for my mom right now
###2047 who's a Florida senior.
###2048 After my dad died, my mom and I got Social Security survivors benefits.
###2052 Helped me pay for college.
###2053 It helped her go back to college in her 50s,
###2055 where she started a small business because of the new skills she got.
###2059 She paid all of her taxes on the promise
###2062 that these programs would be there for her.
###2064 We will honor this promise.
###2066 And the best way to do it is reform it for my generation.
###2069 You see, if you reform these programs for my generation, people 54 and below,
###2074 you can guarantee they don't change for people in or near retirement,
###2077 which is precisely what Mitt Romney and I are proposing.
###2080 Look at what — look what "Obamacare" does.
###2082 "Obamacare" takes $716 billion from Medicare to spend on "Obamacare."
###2088 Even their own chief actuary at Medicare backs this up.
###2092 He says you can't spend the same dollar twice.
###2094 You can't claim that this money goes to Medicare and "Obamacare."
###2098 And then they put this new "Obamacare" board
###2100 in charge of cutting Medicare each and every year
###2102 in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors.
###2106 This board, by the way, it's 15 people.
###2108 The president's supposed to appoint them next year.
###2110 And not one of them even has to have medical training.
###2113 And Social Security, if we don't shore up Social Security,
###2115 when we run out of the IOUs, when the program goes bankrupt,
###2119 a 25% across-the-board benefit cut kicks in on current seniors
###2123 in the middle of their retirement.
###2124 We're going to stop that from happening.
###2126 They haven't put a credible solution on the table.
###2129 He'll tell you about vouchers.
###2132 He'll say all these things to try and scare people.
###2134 Here's what we're saying:
###2136 Give younger people, when they become Medicare-eligible,
###2139 guaranteed coverage options that you can't be denied,
###2143 including traditional Medicare.
###2145 Choose your plan, and then Medicare subsidizes your premiums,
###2147 not as much for the wealthy people,
###2150 more coverage for middle-income people
###2151 and total out-of-pocket coverage for the poor and the sick.
###2154 Choice and competition
###2155 — we would rather have 50 million future seniors determine
###2158 how their Medicare is delivered to them
###2160 instead of 15 bureaucrats deciding what —
###2162 if, where, when they get it.
###2164 [Raddatz] Vice President Biden, 2 minutes.
###2166 [Biden] You know, I heard that death panel argument from Sarah Palin.
###2168 It seems that every vice presidential debate,
###2169 I hear this kind of stuff about panels. But let's talk about Medicare.
###2174 What we did is we saved $716 billion and put it back
###2179 — applied it to Medicare.
###2181 We cut the cost of Medicare.
###2183 We stopped overpaying insurance companies
###2185 when doctors and hospitals — the AMA supported what we did.
###2189 AARP endorsed what we did. And it extends the life of Medicare to 2024.
###2196 They want to wipe this all out.
###2198 It also gave more benefits.
###2199 Any senior out there, ask yourself: Do you have more benefits today?
###2204 You do. If you're near the doughnut hole,
###2205 you have $600 more to help your prescription drug costs.
###2209 You get wellness visits without copays.
###2211 They wipe all of this out, and Medicare goes —
###2214 becomes insolvent in 2016, number 1.
###2217 Number 2, guaranteed benefit — it's a voucher.
###2220 When they first proposed
###2222 — when the congressman had his first voucher program,
###2224 the CBO said it would cost $6,400 a year, Martha,
###2231 more for every senior 55 and below when they got there.
###2235 He knew that, yet he got it — all the guys in Congress,
###2239 and women in the Republican party to vote for it.
###2241 Governor Romney, knowing that, said, I — I — I would sign it were I there.
###2247 Who you believe, the AMA? Me? A guy who's fought his whole life for this?
###2252 Or somebody who had actually put in motion a plan that knowingly cut
###2256 — added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?
###2262 Now they got a new plan. Trust me, it's not going to cost you any more.
###2266 Folks, follow your instincts on this one.
###2269 And with regard to Social Security, we will not — we will not privatize it.
###2273 If we had listened to Romney,
###2275 to Governor Romney and the congressman during the Bush years,
###2279 imagine where all those seniors would be now
###2282 if their money had been in the market.
###2283 Their ideas are old, and their ideas are bad,
###2287 and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare.
###2290 [Ryan] Here's the problem.
###2291 They got caught with their hands in the cookie jar
###2294 turning Medicare into a piggy bank for "Obamacare".
###2297 Their own actuary from the administration came to Congress
###2301 and said 1 out of 6 hospitals and nursing homes
###2304 are going to go out of business as a result of this.
###2306 [Biden] That's not what they said.
###2307 [Ryan] 7.4 million seniors are projected
###2309 to lose the current Medicare Advantage coverage they have.
###2312 That's a $3,200 benefit cut.
###2314 [Biden] That didn't happen.
###2315 [Ryan] What we're saying —
###2315 [Biden] More people signed up.
###2316 [Ryan] These are from your own actuaries.
###2317 [Biden] More — more — more people signed up for Medicare Advantage
###2320 after the change.
###2321 [Ryan] What — what they're —
###2322 [Biden] No — nobody is getting shut down.
###2323 [Ryan] Mr. Vice President, I know —
###2324 [Biden] No — no — (inaudible) —
###2325 [Ryan] Mr. Vice President, I know you're under a lot of duress
###2327 [Biden laughs]
###2328 [Ryan] to make up for lost ground [Biden laughs]
###2329 but I think people would be better served
###2331 if we don't keep interrupting each other.
###2332 [Biden] Well, don't take all the 4 minutes, then.
###2334 [Ryan] Now let me just — let me say this.
###2335 We are not — we are saying, don't change benefits for people 55 and above.
###2338 They already organized their retirement around these promises.
###2341 [Biden] They already are —
###2342 [Ryan] But you want to — (inaudible) — these programs for those of us —
###2343 [Raddatz] Let me ask you this:
###2344 what is your specific plan for seniors who really can't afford
###2348 to make up the difference
###2349 in the value of what you call a premium support plan
###2353 and others call a voucher?
###2354 [Ryan] 100% coverage for them.
###2355 [Raddatz] And what —
###2356 [Ryan] That's what we're saying.
###2357 [Raddatz] — what would cost —
###2358 [Ryan] So we're saying income-adjust —
###2359 [Raddatz] How do you make that up?
###2359 [Ryan] — these premium support payments
###2360 by taking down the subsidies for wealthy people.
###2363 Look, this is a plan — by the way,
###2366 that $6,400 number, it was misleading then.
###2368 It's totally inaccurate now. This is a plan that's bipartisan.
###2372 It's a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat senator from Oregon.
###2375 [Biden] There's not one Democrat who endorsed his —
###2377 [Ryan] It's a plan —
###2378 [Biden] — not one Democrat who signed his plan.
###2380 [Ryan] Our partner is a Democrat from Oregon.
###2381 [Biden] And he said he does no longer support (you for that ?).
###2384 [Ryan] We — we put it — we put it together
###2385 with the former Clinton budget director.
###2386 [Biden] Who disavows it. (Chuckles.)
###2387 [Ryan] This idea — this idea came from the Clinton commission to save Medicare,
###2392 chaired by Senator John Breaux. Here's the point, Martha.
###2394 [Biden] Which was rejected.
###2395 [Ryan] If we don't — if we don't fix this problem pretty soon,
###2398 then current seniors get cut! Here's the problem. 10,000 people
###2405 and they will for 20 years.
###2406 That's not a political thing. That's a math thing.
###2407 [Biden] Martha, if we just did one thing, if we just —
###2409 if they allow Medicare to bargain for the cost of drugs like Medicaid can,
###2415 that would save $156 billion right off the bat.
###2419 [Ryan] And it would deny seniors choices.
###2421 [Biden] All — all — all —
###2422 [Ryan] It — it has restricted (formula ?) —
###2423 [Biden] Seniors are not denied.
###2424 [Ryan] Absolutely.
###2425 [Biden] Sorry, they are not denied.
###2426 Look, folks, and all you seniors out there,
###2429 are you being denied choices?
###2431 Have you lost Medicare Advantage or, if you have signed up —
###2433 [Ryan] Because it's working well right now.
###2434 [Biden] Because we changed the law!
###2435 [Raddatz] Vice President Biden, let me ask you,
###2436 if it could help solve the problem,
###2438 why not very slowly raise the Medicare eligibility age by 2 years,
###2443 as Congressman Ryan suggests?
###2445 [Biden] Look, I was there when we did that with Social Security, in 1983.
###2450 I was 1 of 8 people sitting in the room
###2452 that included Tip O'Neill negotiating with President Reagan.
###2456 We all got together, and everybody said,
###2457 as long as everybody's in the deal, everybody's in the deal,
###2461 and everybody is making some sacrifice, we can find a way.
###2464 We made the system solvent to 2033.
###2468 We will not, though, be part of any voucher plan eliminating
###2474 — the voucher says, Mom, when you're — when you're 65, go out there,
###2478 shop for the best insurance you can get; you're out of Medicare.
###2481 You can buy back in, if you want, with this voucher,
###2484 which will not keep pace — will not keep pace with health care costs,
###2487 because if it did keep pace with health care costs,
###2490 there would be no savings.
###2491 That's why they go the voucher — they —
###2494 we will be no part of a voucher program or the privatization of Social Security.
###2501 [Ryan] A voucher is you go to your mailbox,
###2502 get a check and buy something. Nobody's proposing that.
###2505 Barack Obama, 4 years ago, running for president, said
###2509 if you don't have any fresh ideas, use stale tactics to scare voters.
###2514 If you don't have a good record to run on,
###2517 paint your opponent as someone people should run from.
###2519 Make a big election about small ideas.
###2521 [Raddatz] You were one of the few lawmakers to stand with President Bush
###2524 when he was seeking to partially privatize Social Security.
###2527 [Ryan] For younger people.
###2528 What we said then and what I've always agreed is
###2531 let younger Americans have a voluntary choice
###2534 of making their money work faster for them within the Social Security system.
###2537 [Biden] You saw how well that worked.
###2538 [Ryan] That's not what Mitt Romney's proposing.
###2539 What we're saying is no changes for anybody 55 and above.
###2543 [Biden] What Mitt Romney is proposing —
###2544 [Ryan] And then the kinds of the changes we're talking about
###2546 for younger people like myself is
###2548 don't increase the benefits for wealthy people as fast as everybody else —
###2551 [Biden] Martha —
###2552 [Ryan] — slowly raise the retirement age over time.
###2554 [Ryan] It wouldn't get to the age of 70 until the year 2103,
###2556 [Biden] Martha -
###2557 [Ryan] according to the actuaries.
###2559 Now, here's the issue.
###2560 [Raddatz] Quickly, Vice President.
###2561 [Biden] Quickly, the bottom line here is that all the studies show that
###2564 if we went with Social Security proposal made by Mitt Romney,
###2568 if you're 40 — in your 40s now, you will pay $2,600 a year —
###2572 you get $2,600 a year less in Social Security.
###2575 If you're in your 20s now, you get $4,700 a year less.
###2578 The idea of changing
###2580 — and change being, in this case, to cut the benefits for people
###2584 without taking other action you could do to make it work —
###2587 is absolutely the wrong way.
###2589 These — look, these guys haven't been big on Medicare from the beginning.
###2593 Their party's not been big on Medicare from the beginning.
###2596 And they've always been about Social Security as little as you can do.
###2599 Look, folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this?
###2604 A man who introduced a bill that would raise it $6,400 a year,
###2609 knowing it and passing it, and Romney saying he'd sign it?
###2613 Or me and the president?
###2614 [Ryan] That statistic was completely misleading.
###2616 But more importantly —
###2617 [Biden] That's — there are the facts, right?
###2618 [Ryan] — this is — this is what politicians do
###2620 when they don't have a record to run on:
###2621 try to scare people from voting for you.
###2624 If you don't get ahead of this problem, it's going to — (inaudible) —
###2628 [Biden] Medicare beneficiaries have more benefits now — (inaudible) —
###2630 [Ryan] We are not going to run away — we are not going to run away —
###2630 [Raddatz] OK. We're going to —
###2631 we're going to move on to a very simple question to you both.
###2633 [Ryan] Medicare and Social Security did so much for my own family.
###2635 We are not going to jeopardize this program,
###2638 but we have to save it for the next generation so it doesn't go bankrupt.
###2641 [Biden] You are jeopardizing the program.
###2642 You're changing the program from a guaranteed benefit to a premium support.
###2645 Whatever you call it, the bottom line is
###2647 people are going to have to pay more money out of their pocket.
###2649 [Biden] And the families -
###2650 [Ryan] The wealthy would. [Biden] -  I know and the families I come from
###2652 — they don't have the money to pay more out of — (inaudible).
###2654 [Raddatz] Gentlemen, gentlemen —
###2655 [Ryan] That's why we're saying more for lower-income people
###2656 and less for higher-income people.
###2658 [Raddatz] I would like to move on to a very simple question for both of you.
###2660 And something tells me —
###2662 [Biden chuckles.]
###2663 [Raddatz] — I won't get a very simple answer. But let me ask you this.
###2666 [Biden] I gave you a simple answer: He's raising the cost of Medicare.
###2669 [Raddatz] OK, on to taxes.
###2670 If your ticket is elected, who will pay more in taxes?
###2674 Who will pay less?
###2675 And we're starting with Vice President Biden for 2 minutes.
###2678 [Biden] The middle class will pay less,
###2679 and people making a million dollars or more
###2681 will begin to contribute slightly more.
###2683 Let me give you 1 concrete example:
###2685 the continuation of the Bush tax cuts.
###2688 We're arguing that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy
###2690 should be allowed to expire.
###2692 Of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, 800 million
###2696 — billion dollars of that goes to people
###2697 making a minimum of a million dollars.
###2699 We see no justification in these economic times for those
###2703 — and they're patriotic Americans.
###2705 They're — they're not asking for this continued tax cut;
###2708 they're not suggesting it;
###2710 but my friends are insisting on it.
###2711 A hundred and twenty thousand families, by continuing that tax cut,
###2716 will get an additional $500 billion in tax relief in the next 10 years,
###2721 and their income is an average of $8 million.
###2724 We want to extend permanently the middle-class tax cut for
###2728 — permanently from the Bush middle-class tax cut.
###2731 These guys won't allow us to.
###2733 You know what we're saying? We say let's have a vote.
###2735 Let's have a vote on the middle-class tax cut,
###2738 and let's have a vote on the upper tax cut.
###2740 Let's go ahead and vote on it. They're saying no.
###2742 They're holding hostage the middle-class tax cut to the super wealthy.
###2747 And on top of that,
###2748 they got another tax cut coming that's $5 trillion
###2751 that all of the studies point out will, in fact,
###2754 give another $250 million dollar —
###2758 yeah, $250,000 a year to those 120,000 families
###2761 and raise taxes for people who are middle-income
###2765 with a child by $2,000 a year.
###2769 This is unconscionable.
###2770 There is no need for this.
###2772 The middle class got knocked on their heels.
###2774 The Great Recession crushed them.
###2777 They need some help now.
###2779 The last people who need help are 120,000 families
###2782 for another — another $500 billion tax cut over the next 10 years.
###2789 [Raddatz] Congressman.
###2792 [Ryan] Our entire premise of these tax reform plans
###2795 is to grow the economy and create jobs.
###2797 It's a plan that's estimated to create 7 million jobs.
###2799 Now, we think that government taking 28%
###2804 of a family and business' income is enough.
###2807 President Obama thinks that the government ought to be able
###2810 to take as much as 44.8% of a small business' income.
###2814 Look, if you taxed every person in successful small business
###2819 making over $250,000 at 100%,
###2822 it'd only run the government for 98 days.
###2825 If everybody who paid income taxes last year,
###2827 including successful small businesses,
###2829 doubled their income taxes this year,
###2831 we'd still have a $300 billion deficit.
###2833 You see, there aren't enough rich people and small businesses to tax
###2838 to pay for all their spending.
###2840 And so the next time you hear them say, don't worry about it,
###2844 we'll get a few wealthy people to pay their fair share,
###2846 watch out, middle class. The tax bill is coming to you.
###2851 That's why we're saying we need fundamental tax reform.
###2854 Let's take a look at it this way:
###2855 8-out-of-10 businesses, they file their taxes as individuals,
###2859 not as corporations.
###2860 And where I come from, overseas,
###2862 which is Lake Superior [chuckles]
###2863 the Canadians — they drop their tax rates to 15%.
###2867 The average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world
###2870 is 25%,
###2871 and the president wants the top effective tax rate
###2875 on successful small businesses to go above 40%.
###2878 2/3 of our jobs come from small businesses.
###2881 This one tax would actually tax about 53% of small-business income.
###2887 It's expected that'd cost us 710,000 jobs.
###2890 And you know what?
###2891 It doesn't even pay for 10% of their proposed deficit spending increases.
###2896 What we are saying is: lower tax rates across the board and close loopholes,
###2901 primarily to the higher-income people.
###2902 We have 3 bottom lines:
###2904 Don't raise the deficit,
###2906 don't raise taxes on the middle class
###2908 and don't lower the share of income that is borne by the high-income earners.
###2912 He — he'll keep saying this $5 trillion plan, I suppose —
###2915 [Biden chuckles]
###2915 [Ryan] — it's been discredited by six other studies,
###2918 and even their own deputy campaign manager acknowledged
###2921 that it wasn't correct.
###2922 [Raddatz] Well, let's talk about this 20%.
###2924 [Biden] Well — (chuckles) —
###2925 [Raddatz] You have refused yet again to offer specifics
###2928 on how you pay for that 20% across-the-board tax cut.
###2933 Do you actually have the specifics, or are you still working on it,
###2938 and that's why you won't tell voters?
###2940 [Ryan] Different than this administration,
###2941 we actually want to have big bipartisan agreements.
###2944 You see, I understand the —
###2945 [Raddatz] Do you have the specifics?
###2946 Do you have the math?
###2947 Do you know exactly what you're doing?
###2948 [Biden] That'll be — that'd be a first for the Republican Congress.
###2949 [Ryan] Look — look at what Mitt —
###2950 look at what Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did.
###2953 They worked together out of a framework to lower tax rates
###2956 and broaden the base, and they worked together to fix that.
###2959 What we're saying is here's our framework:
###2962 Lower tax rates 20% —
###2963 we raise about $1.2 trillion through income taxes.
###2967 We forgo about 1.1 trillion (dollars) in loopholes and deductions.
###2971 And so what we're saying is deny those loopholes and deductions
###2974 to higher- income taxpayers so that more of their income is taxed,
###2978 which has a broader base of taxation —
###2980 [Biden] Can I translate?
###2981 [Ryan] — so we can lower tax rates across the board.
###2983 Now, here's why I'm saying this.
###2985 What we're saying is here's a framework —
###2986 [Biden] I hope I'm going to get time to respond to this.
###2987 [Ryan] We want to work with Congress —
###2988 [Raddatz] I — you'll get time.
###2989 [Ryan] We want to work with Congress on how best to achieve this.
###2991 That means successful — look —
###2993 [Raddatz] No specifics, yeah.
###2994 [Ryan] Mitt — what we're saying is
###2996 lower tax rates 20%, start with the wealthy,
###2999 work with Congress to do it —
###3000 [Raddatz] And you guarantee this math will add up.
###3001 [Ryan] Absolutely. Six studies have guaranteed
###3004 — six studies have verified that this math adds up,
###3006 but here's the other point —
###3006 [Raddatz] Vice President Biden —
###3007 [Biden] Look —
###3007 [Ryan] (Inaudible) — one point — (inaudible) —
###3008 [Raddatz] Vice President Biden.
###3009 [Biden] Let me translate. Let me have a chance to translate.
###3010 [Ryan] I'll come back in a second then, right?
###3011 [Biden] First of all, I was there when Ronald Reagan tax breaks
###3014 — I mean, he gave specifics of what he was going to cut -
###3016 No, number 1, in terms of tax expenditures.
###3019 Number 2, 97% of the small businesses of America pay less
###3024 — make less than $250,000.
###3026 Let me tell you who some of those other small businesses are:
###3029 hedge funds that make 6, 800 million dollars a year.
###3033 That — that's what they count as small business
###3035 because they're passthrough.
###3036 Let's look at how sincere they are.
###3038 Ronald — I mean, excuse me, Governor Romney, on "60 Minutes,"
###3042 I guess it's about 10 days ago,
###3043 was asked, Governor, you pay 14% on $20 million.
###3047 Someone making $50,000 pays more than that.
###3050 Do you think that's fair?
###3051 He said, oh, yes, that's fair; that's fair.
###3054 This is — and they're going to talk —
###3056 I mean, you think these guys are going to go out there
###3057 and cut those loopholes?
###3059 The loophole — the biggest loophole they take advantage of
###3061 is the carried interest loophole and —
###3063 and capital gains loophole.
###3064 They exempt that.
###3066 Now, there's not enough — the reason why the AEI study,
###3069 the American Enterprise Institute study,
###3071 the Tax Policy Center study,
###3073 the reason they all say it's going to
###3075 — taxes will go up on the middle class,
###3077 the only way you can find $5 trillion in loopholes
###3082 is cut the mortgage deduction for middle-class people,
###3085 cut the health care deduction for middle-class people,
###3087 take away their ability to get a tax break to send their kids to college.
###3091 That's why they — (inaudible) —
###3092 [Raddatz] Is he wrong about that?
###3093 [Ryan] He is wrong about that. There are — you can —
###3095 [Biden] How's that?
###3096 [Ryan] You can cut tax rates by 20% and still preserve
###3098 these important preferences for middle-class taxpayers —
###3101 [Biden] Not mathematically possible.
###3102 [Ryan] It is mathematically possible. It's been done before.
###3106 It's precisely what we're proposing.
###3107 [Biden] (Chuckles.) It has never been done before.
###3108 [Ryan] It's been done a couple of times, actually.
###3110 [Biden] It has never been done before.
###3111 [Ryan] Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates, increased growth. Ronald Reagan -
###3113 [Biden] Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy.
###3114 [Ryan] Ronald Reagan
###3116 [Ryan laughs and chuckles
###3117 Republicans and Democrats — [Biden] This is amazing.
###3119 [Ryan] Republicans and Democrats have worked together on this.
###3122 [Biden] That's right.
###3122 [Ryan] I understand aren't used to doing bipartisan deals.
###3124 [Biden] But we told each other what we were going to do.
###3125 When we did with Reagan, he said —
###3126 [Ryan] Republicans and Democrats —
###3127 [Biden] — here — here are the things we're going to cut.
###3128 This is what he said. [Ryan] We can agree on a framework;
###3129 let's work together to fill in the details. That's exactly —
###3131 [Biden] Fill in the details.
###3131 [Ryan] That's how you get things done. You work with Congress —
###3133 [Biden] (Seriously?).
###3134 [Ryan] Look, let me say it this way. Mitt Romney was governor —
###3135 [Biden] That's coming from the Republican Congress working bipartisanly?
###3139 [Ryan] Mitt — Mitt Romney —
###3140 [Biden] 7% rating? Come on.
###3142 [Ryan] Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts,
###3144 where 87% of the legislators he served with were Democrats.
###3147 He didn't demonize them. He didn't demagogue them.
###3150 He met with those party leaders every week.
###3152 [Biden chuckles]
###3152 [Ryan] He reached across the aisle. He didn't compromise principles.
###3155 [Biden] And you saw what happened (?).
###3156 [Ryan] He found common ground, and he balanced the budget.
###3157 [Biden] You saw it (?) — if he did such a great job —
###3159 if he did such a great job in Massachusetts —
###3160 [Raddatz] Vice President, what —
###3160 [Ryan] He balanced the budget 4 times.
###3162 He balanced the budget 4 times without raising taxes.
###3162 [Biden] — why isn't he even contesting Massachusetts?
###3164 [Ryan] (Inaudible.)
###3164 [Raddatz] Vice President, what would you suggest —
###3167 what would you suggest beyond raising taxes on the wealthy
###3169 that would substantially reduce the long-term deficit?
###3172 [Biden] Not — just let the taxes expire
###3173 like they're supposed to on those millionaires.
###3176 We don't — we can't afford $800 billion
###3180 going to people making a minimum a million dollars.
###3183 They do not need it, Martha. Those 120,000 families make $8 million a year.
###3190 Middle-class people need the help.
###3192 Why does my friend cut out the tuition tax credit for them?
###3195 Why does he go out after the child — (inaudible)?
###3197 [Raddatz] Can you declare anything off-limits —
###3198 [Biden] Why do they do that?
###3199 [Raddatz] Can you declare anything off limits?
###3201 Home mortgages deductions —
###3202 [Ryan] Yeah. We're saying close loopholes on high-interest people—
###3203 [Raddatz] Home mortgage deductions —
###3204 [Ryan] — for higher-income people. Here —
###3206 [Biden] Can you guarantee that no one —
###3207 [Ryan] This taxes —
###3208 [Biden] — making less than $100,000 will have a mortgage —
###3211 [Ryan] This —
###3211 [Biden] — their mortgage deduction impacted? Guarantee?
###3213 [Ryan] This taxes a million small businesses.
###3214 He keeps trying to make you think
###3216 that it's just some movie star or hedge fund guy or an actor—
###3219 [Biden] 97% of the small businesses
###3221 make less than $250,000 a year —
###3224 [Ryan] Joe —
###3225 [Biden] — would not be affected.
###3226 [Ryan] — you know, it hits a million —
###3228 this taxes a million people, a million small businesses —
###3230 [Biden] Doesn't tax 97% of the American businesses
###3233 — small businesses —
###3234 [Ryan] It — it taxes a million small businesses,
###3235 who are our great job creators.
###3236 [Biden] I wish I'd get it —
###3237 the greatest job creators are the hedge fund guys.
###3238 [Ryan] (Let's end ?) —
###3238 [Raddatz] And you're going
###3239 — and you're going to increase the defense budget.
###3239 [Ryan] Think about it this way.
###3240 [Raddatz] And you're going to increase the defense budget.
###3242 [Ryan] No, we're just not going to cut the defense budget
###3244 like they're — they're proposing —
###3244 [Biden] They're going to increase it $2 billion — $2 trillion.
###3246 [Ryan] That's not accurate. We're talking about preventing —
###3248 [Raddatz] More than that. No — so no massive defense increase?
###3251 [Ryan] No, we're saying is, don't —
###3251 OK, you want to get into defense now?
###3252 [Raddatz] Let — yes, I do. I do —
###3254 [Ryan] All right. So —
###3255 [Raddatz] — because that's another math question.
###3255 [Ryan] Right. OK.
###3256 [Raddatz] How do you do that?
###3257 [Ryan] So they proposed a $478 (sic) billion cut to defense
###3261 to begin with.
###3262 Now we have another $500 billion cut to defense
###3265 that's lurking on the horizon.
###3267 They insisted upon that cut being involved in the debt negotiations —
###3271 [Raddatz] Let —
###3272 [Ryan] — and now we have a $1 trillion cut —
###3273 [Raddatz] Let's put the automatic defense cuts aside. OK?
###3275 [Ryan] Right. OK.
###3275 [Raddatz] Let's put those aside. No one wants that.
###3277 [Biden] I'd like to go back to that.
###3278 [Ryan] OK.
###3278 [Raddatz] But I want to know how you do the math
###3279 and have this increase in defense spending?
###3281 [Biden] 2 trillion dollars.
###3283 [Ryan] You don't cut defense by a trillion dollars.
###3285 That's what we're talking about. The additional trillion —
###3286 [Raddatz] And what national security issues justify an increase?
###3289 [Biden] Who's cutting it by a trillion?
###3290 [Ryan] We're going to cut 80,000 soldiers, 20,000 Marines,
###3294 120 cargo planes.
###3298 We're going to push the Joint Strike Fighter out.
###3299 [Raddatz] Drawing down in one war —
###3300 [Ryan] We're cutting missile defense.
###3301 [Raddatz] — and one war — (inaudible ) —
###3302 [Ryan] If these cuts go through, our Navy will be the small it is
###3305 — it — the smallest it has been since before World War I.
###3308 This invites weakness.
###3311 Look, do we believe in peace through strength?
###3312 You bet we do.
###3313 And that means you don't impose these devastating cuts on our military.
###3317 So we're saying don't cut the military by a trillion dollars,
###3321 not increase it by a trillion, don't cut it by a trillion dollars.
###3324 [Raddatz] Quickly, Vice President Biden, on this, and I want to move on.
###3326 [Biden] Look, we don't cut it.
###3328 And I might add this so-called
###3329 — I know we don't want to use the fancy word "sequester," this automatic cut —
###3333 that was part of a debt deal that they asked for.
###3335 And let me tell you what my friend said at a press conference
###3338 announcing his support of the deal.
###3340 He said — and I'm — we've been looking for this moment for a long time. (Inaudible) —
###3345 [Ryan] Can I tell you what that meant?
###3347 [Biden] Why —
###3347 [Ryan] We've been looking for bipartisanship for a long time.
###3349 [Biden] And so the bipartisanship is what he voted for:
###3351 the automatic cuts in defense if they didn't act.
###3354 And beyond that, they asked for another —
###3356 look, the military says, we need a smaller, leaner Army.
###3361 We need more special forces.
###3362 We need — we don't need more M1 tanks. What we need is more UAVs.
###3366 [Raddatz] Some of the military — I know that's — (inaudible) —
###3367 [Biden] Not some of the military;
###3369 that was the decision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
###3373 recommended to us and agreed to by the president.
###3376 That's a fact.
###3377 [Raddatz] Who answers to the civilian leaders.
###3378 [Biden] They made the recommendation first.
###3380 [Raddatz] OK. Let's move on to Afghanistan.
###3382 [Ryan] Can I get into that for a second?
###3383 [Raddatz] I'd like to move on to Afghanistan, please.
###3385 [Ryan] OK.
###3386 [Raddatz] And that's one of the biggest expenditures this country has made,
###3389 in dollars and, more importantly, in lives.
###3392 We just passed the sad milestone of losing 2,000 U.S. troops there in this war.
###3397 More than 50 of them were killed this year
###3400 by the very Afghan forces we are trying to help.
###3403 Now, we've reached the recruiting goal for Afghan forces.
###3407 We've degraded al-Qaida.
###3409 So tell me, why not leave now?
###3412 What more can we really accomplish?
###3414 Is it worth more American lives?
###3417 [Ryan] We don't want to lose the gains we've gotten.
###3419 We want to make sure that the Taliban does not come back in
###3423 and give al- Qaida a safe haven.
###3425 We agree with the administration on their 2014 transition.
###3429 Look, when I think about Afghanistan,
###3431 I think about the incredible job that our troops have done.
###3435 You've been there more than the 2 of us combined.
###3437 First time I was there in 2002,
###3439 it was amazing to me what they were facing.
###3441 When I went to the Arghandab Valley in Kandahar before the surge,
###3446 I sat down with a young private in the 82nd
###3448 from the Menominee Indian Reservation
###3449 who would tell me what he did every day, and I was in awe.
###3453 And to see what they had in front of them
###3455 — and then to go back there in December,
###3456 to go throughout Helmand with the Marines
###3458 to see what they had accomplished
###3459 — it's nothing short of amazing.
###3461 What we don't want to do is lose the gains we've gotten.
###3465 Now, we've disagreed from time to time on a few issues.
###3469 We would have more likely taken into account
###3471 the recommendations from our commanders, General Petraeus, Admiral Mullen,
###3475 on troop levels throughout this year's fighting season.
###3479 We've been skeptical about negotiations with the Taliban,
###3481 especially while they're shooting at us.
###3483 But we want to see the 2014 transition be successful.
###3487 And that means we want to make sure our commanders have what they need
###3492 to make sure that it is successful
###3494 so that this does not once again become a launching pad for terrorists.
###3498 [Raddatz] Vice President Biden.
###3499 [Biden] Martha, let's keep our eye on the ball.
###3501 The reason I've been in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq 20 times
###3505 — I've been up in the Kunar valley —
###3507 I've been throughout that whole country, mostly in a helicopter
###3510 and sometimes in a vehicle.
###3513 The fact is we went there for one reason:
###3516 to get those people who killed Americans, al-Qaida.
###3520 We've decimated al-Qaida central.
###3522 We have eliminated Osama bin Laden. That was our purpose.
###3527 And in fact, in the meantime, what we said we would do,
###3530 we would help train the Afghan military.
###3534 It's their responsibility to take over their own security.
###3539 That's why, with 49 of our allies in Afghanistan,
###3544 we've agreed on a gradual drawdown so we're out of there by the year twenty -
###3550 — in the year 2014.
###3552 My friend and the governor say it's based on conditions,
###3555 which means it depends.
###3557 It does not depend for us.
###3560 It is the responsibility of the Afghans to take care of their own security.
###3565 We have trained over 315,000, mostly without incident.
###3570 There have been more than 2 dozen cases of green on blue
###3574 where Americans have been killed.
###3575 If we do — if the — if the measures the military has taken do not take hold,
###3580 we will not go on joint patrols, we will not train in the field.
###3584 We'll only train in the — in the Army bases that exist there.
###3590 But we are leaving.
###3592 We are leaving in 2014, period.
###3596 And in the process, we're going to be saving over the next 10 years
###3600 another $800 billion.
###3602 We've been in this war for over a decade.
###3605 The primary objective is almost completed.
###3609 Now all we're doing is putting the Kabul government in a position
###3613 to be able to maintain their own security.
###3616 It's their responsibility, not America's.
###3620 [Raddatz] What conditions could justify staying, Congressman Ryan?
###3624 [Ryan] We don't want to stay.
###3625 We want — look, one of my best friends in Janesville, a reservist,
###3630 is at a forward operating base in Eastern Afghanistan right now.
###3633 Our wives are best friends, our daughters are best friends.
###3636 I want — I want him and all of our troops to come home
###3640 as soon and safely as possible.
###3642 We want to make sure that 2014 is successful.
###3645 That's why we want to make sure that we give our commanders
###3648 what they say they need to make it successful.
###3650 We don't want to extend beyond 2014. That's the point we're making.
###3653 You know, if it was just this, I feel like we would
###3658 — we would be able to call this a success, but it's not.
###3662 What we are witnessing as we turn on our television screens these days,
###3666 is the absolute unraveling of the Obama foreign policy.
###3670 Problems are growing at home, but jobs
###3673 — problems are growing abroad –
###3674 but jobs aren't growing here at home.
###3677 [Raddatz] Let me go back to this.
###3677 He says we're absolutely leaving in 2014.
###3682 You're saying that's not an absolute,
###3685 but you won't talk about what conditions would justify —
###3686 [Ryan] Do you know why we say that?
###3687 Do you know why we say that?
###3688 [Biden] I'd like to know why.
###3689 [Ryan] Because we don't want to broadcast to our enemies,
###3691 put a date on your calendar,
###3693 wait us out and then come back.
###3695 We want to make sure —
###3696 [Raddatz] But you agree with the timeline?
###3697 [Ryan] We do — we do agree with the timeline in the transition,
###3700 but what we — what any administration will do in 2013
###3704 is assess the situation to see how best to complete this timeline.
###3709 What we do not want to do —
###3709 [Biden] We will leave in 2014.
###3711 [Ryan] What we do not want to do is give our allies reason
###3715 to trust us less and our enemies more —
###3719 we don't want to embolden our enemies
###3721 to hold and wait out for us and then take over the —
###3723 [Biden] Martha, that's a bizarre statement.
###3725 [Ryan] That's why we want to make sure
###3726 — no, that's why we want to make sure that this — that —
###3727 [Biden] That's a bizarre statement, since 49 of our allies — hear me,
###3729 49 of our allies signed onto this position, 49.
###3735 [Ryan] And we're reading that they want to pull out early.
###3737 [Biden] 49. 49 of our allies said out in 2014.
###3741 It's the responsibility of the Afghans.
###3744 We have other responsibilities —
###3745 [Ryan] Which is — which is — which is what we agree with.
###3745 [Raddatz] Do you — do you think that this timeline — but we have — we have soldiers and Marines —
###3749 [Biden] (Theirs are sufficient. ?)
###3750 [Raddatz] We have Afghan forces murdering our forces over there.
###3754 The Taliban is, do you think, taking advantage of this timeline?
###3758 [Biden] Well, look, the Taliban — what we've found out —
###3763 and we — you — you saw it in Iraq, Martha.
###3765 Unless you set a timeline,
###3767 Baghdad in the case of Iraq and — and Kabul in the case of Afghanistan
###3774 will not step up.
###3775 They're happy to let us continue to do the job —
###3777 international security forces to do the job.
###3780 The only way they step up is say, fellas, we're leaving;
###3784 we've trained you; step up. Step up.
###3788 [Raddatz] But let me — let me go back —
###3789 [Biden] That's the only way it works.
###3790 [Raddatz] Let me go back to the surge troops that we put in there.
###3794 And you brought this up, Congressman Ryan.
###3796 I have talked to a lot of troops.
###3798 I've talked to senior officers who were concerned
###3801 that the surge troops were pulled out during the fighting season,
###3806 and some of them saw that as a political — as a political move.
###3810 So can you tell me, Vice President Biden,
###3812 what was the military reason for bringing those surge troops home
###3816 before the fighting season ended?
###3816 [Biden] The military reason was bringing
###3818 — by the way, when the president announced the surge —
###3820 you'll remember, Martha —
###3821 he said, the surge will be out by the end of the summer.
###3826 The military said, the surge will be out.
###3829 Nothing political about this.
###3831 Before the surge occurred
###3833 — so you be a little straight with me here, too —
###3835 before the surge occurred, we said,
###3838 they'll be out by the end of the summer.
###3841 That's what the military said. The reason for that is —
###3843 [Raddatz] Military follows orders.
###3845 They — I mean, there — trust me, there are people —
###3847 [Biden] Sure —
###3848 [Raddatz] — who were concerned about pulling out on the fighting season.
###3849 [Biden] But — there are people that were concerned,
###3851 but not the Joint Chiefs.
###3852 That was their recommendation in the Oval Office
###3856 to the president of the United States of America.
###3858 I sat there.
###3860 I'm sure you'll find someone who disagrees with the Pentagon.
###3862 I'm positive you'll find that within the military. But that's not the case here.
###3867 And secondly, the reason why the military said that
###3870 is you cannot wait and have a cliff.
###3874 It takes, you know, months and months and months to draw down forces.
###3879 (Inaudible) — cannot wait —
###3880 [Ryan] Let me bring some
###3881 — let me try and illustrate the issue here, because I think this —
###3884 it can get a little confusing.
###3885 We've all met with General Allen and General Scaparotti in Afghanistan
###3889 to talk about fighting seasons.
###3891 Here's the way it works.
###3892 The mountain passes fill in with snow.
###3894 The Taliban and the terrorists and the Haqqani and the Quetta shura
###3898 come over from Pakistan to fight our men and women.
###3902 When it fills in with snow, they can't do it.
###3903 That's what we call fighting seasons.
###3905 In the warm months fighting gets really high;
###3907 in the winter it goes down.
###3909 And so when Admiral Mullen and General Petraeus came to Congress and said,
###3915 if you pull these people out before the fighting season is end,
###3919 it puts people more at risk — that's the problem.
###3922 Yes, we drew 22,000 troops down last month.
###3925 But the remaining troops that are there,
###3927 who still have the same mission to prosecute, counterinsurgency,
###3931 are doing it with fewer people.
###3934 That makes them less safe.
###3935 [Biden] (Inaudible.)
###3935 [Ryan] We're sending fewer people out in all these hot spots
###3940 to do the same job that they were supposed to do a month ago —
###3942 [Biden] Because we turned it over —
###3943 [Ryan] — but we took 22,000 people out for them to do it.
###3945 [Biden] — we turned it over to the Afghan troops we trained.
###3948 No one got pulled out that didn't get filled in by trained Afghan personnel.
###3955 And he's — he's — he's conflating 2 issues.
###3959 The fighting season that Petraeus was talking about
###3962 and former — and Admiral Mullen was the fighting season this spring.
###3967 That's what he was talking about. We did not — we did not pull them out.
###3971 [Ryan] The calendar works the same every year. (Chuckles.)
###3973 [Biden] It does work the same every year. (Inaudible) — there —
###3975 [Ryan] (Chuckles.) Spring, summer, fall — (chuckles) —
###3978 it's warm or it's not.
###3980 They're still fighting us, they're still coming over the passes,
###3983 they'll — they're still coming in to Zabul or to Kunar,
###3987 to all of these areas,
###3988 but we are sending fewer people to the front to fight them.
###3990 And that is not safe.
###3991 [Biden] That's right, because that's the Afghan responsibility.
###3994 We've trained them.
###3995 [Ryan] Not in the East.
###3996 [Raddatz] Let's move — let's move to another war.
###3998 [Biden] Not in the East? (Inaudible) —
###3999 [Ryan] (Inaudible) — East, RC-East —
###4001 [Biden] RC-East, most dangerous place in the world.
###4002 [Ryan] That's why — that's why we don't want to send fewer people to do the job.
###4004 [Biden] That's — that's why we should send Americans in to do the job
###4006 instead of the — you'd rather Americans be going in and doing the job
###4010 instead of — (inaudible) —
###4010 [Ryan] No. We are already sending Americans to do the job —
###4011 [Biden] No —
###4012 [Ryan] — but fewer of them. That's the whole point.
###4013 [Biden] That — that's right.
###4014 We're sending in more Afghans to do the job, Afghans to do the job.
###4019 [Raddatz] Let's move to another war, the civil war in Syria,
###4022 where there are estimates that — estimates
###4025 that more than 25,000, 30,000 people have now been killed.
###4029 In March of last year, President Obama explained the military action
###4033 taken in Libya by saying it was in the national interest to go in
###4038 and prevent further massacres from occurring there.
###4041 So why doesn't the same logic apply in Syria? Vice President Biden.
###4045 [Biden] It's a different country. It's a different country.
###4048 It is 5 times as large geographically.
###4051 It has 1/5 the population that is Libya,
###4055 1/5 the population, 5 times as large geographically.
###4058 It's in a part of the world where you're not going to see
###4061 whatever would come from that war.
###4064 It'd seep into a regional war.
###4067 You're in a country that is heavily populated
###4070 in the midst of the most dangerous area in the world.
###4073 And in fact, if, in fact, it blows up and the wrong people gain control,
###4078 it's going to have impact on the entire region,
###4081 causing potentially regional wars.
###4083 We are working hand in glove with the Turks,
###4086 with the Jordanians, with the Saudis
###4088 and with all the people in the region
###4091 attempting to identify the people who deserve the help
###4095 so that when Assad goes and he will go,
###4098 there will be a legitimate government that follows on,
###4101 not an al-Qaida-sponsored government that follows on.
###4104 And all this loose talk of my friend, Governor Romney,
###4108 and the congressman about how we're going to do,
###4110 we could do so much more in there,
###4112 what more would they do other than put American boots on the ground?
###4117 The last thing America needs is to get into another ground war
###4121 in the Middle East requiring tens of thousands
###4125 if not well over a hundred thousand American forces.
###4128 That — they are the facts. They are the facts.
###4132 Now, every time the governor is asked about this,
###4135 he doesn't say any — he say —
###4136 he goes up with a whole lot of verbiage,
###4141 but when he gets pressed,
###4142 he says, no, he would not do anything different than we are doing now.
###4146 Are they proposing putting American troops on the ground,
###4149 putting American aircraft in their airspace?
###4151 Is that what they're proposing?
###4152 If they do, they should speak up and say so.
###4155 But that's not what they're saying.
###4158 We are doing it exactly like we need to do to identify those forces
###4165 who, in fact, will provide for a stable government
###4168 and not cause a regional Sunni-Shia war when Bassad (ph)
###4172 — when Bashir Assad falls.
###4174 [Raddatz] Congressman Ryan.
###4175 [Ryan] Nobody is proposing to send troops to Syria — American troops.
###4180 Now let me say it this way.
###4182 How would we do things differently?
###4184 We wouldn't refer Bashar Assad as a reformer
###4188 when he's killing his own civilians with his Russian-provided weapons.
###4192 We wouldn't be outsourcing our foreign policy to the United Nations,
###4196 giving Vladimir Putin veto power over our efforts
###4200 to try and deal with this issue.
###4202 He's vetoed 3 of them.
###4204 Hillary Clinton went to Russia to try and convince him not to do so;
###4208 they thwarted her efforts.
###4209 She said they were on the wrong side of history.
###4211 She was right about that.
###4212 This is just one more example of how the Russia reset's not working.
###4215 And so where are we?
###4217 After international pressure mounted,
###4219 then President Obama said Bashar Assad should go.
###4222 It's been over a year.
###4223 The man has slaughtered tens of thousands of his own people
###4227 and more foreign fighters are spilling into this country.
###4230 So the longer this has gone on, the more people
###4235 — groups like al-Qaida are going in.
###4237 We could have more easily identified the Free Syrian Army,
###4241 the freedom fighters, working with our allies,
###4244 the Turks, the Qataris, the Saudis,
###4246 had we had a better plan in place to begin with, working through our allies.
###4251 But no, we waited for Kofi Annan
###4254 to try and come up with an agreement through the U.N.
###4257 That bought Bashar Assad time.
###4259 We gave Russia veto power over our efforts through the U.N.
###4263 and meanwhile about 30,000 Syrians are dead.
###4267 [Biden] What would my friend do differently?
###4270 If you notice, he never answers the question.
###4272 [Ryan] No, I would — I — we would not be going through the U.N.
###4274 on all of these things —
###4275 [Biden] Let — let — let me — you don't go through the U.N.
###4278 We are in the process now and have been for months
###4282 in making sure that help, humanitarian aid,
###4285 as well as other aid and training,
###4287 is getting to those forces that we believe,
###4291 the Turks believe, the Jordanians believe, the Saudis believe
###4295 are the free forces inside of Syria.
###4298 That is under way.
###4299 Our allies were all on the same page, NATO as well as our Arab allies,
###4306 in terms of trying to get a settlement.
###4309 That was their idea. We're the ones that said, enough.
###4312 With regard to the reset not working,
###4315 the fact of the matter is that Russia has a different interest in Syria
###4318 than we do, and that's not in our interest.
###4321 [Raddatz] What happens if Assad does not fall?
###4324 Congressman Ryan, what happens to the region?
###4327 What happens if he hangs on? What happens if he does?
###4329 [Ryan] Then Iran keeps their greatest ally in the region.
###4334 He's a sponsor of terrorism.
###4335 He'll probably continue slaughtering his people.
###4338 We and the world community will lose our credibility on this.
###4341 Look, he mentioned the reset.
###4343 [Raddatz] So what would Romney-Ryan do about that credibility?
###4345 [Ryan] Well, we agree with the same red line, actually,
###4347 they do on chemical weapons, but not putting American troops in,
###4351 other than to secure those chemical weapons.
###4352 They're right about that.
###4355 But what we should have done earlier is work with those freedom fighters,
###4359 those dissidents in Syria.
###4361 We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer,
###4365 and we should not have
###4366 — we should not have waited to Russia to give us the green light —
###4369 [Biden] We didn't call Assad —
###4370 [Raddatz] What's your criteria for —
###4371 [Ryan] We should not have waited for Russia
###4374 to give us the green light at the U.N. to do something about it.
###4375 [Biden] Russia —
###4375 [Ryan] They're — they're still arming the man.
###4378 Iran is flying flights over Iraq —
###4379 [Biden] And the opposition is being armed —
###4382 [Ryan] — to help — to help — to help Bashar Assad.
###4385 And by the way, if we had the status of forces agreement
###4386 that the vice president said he would bet his vice presidency on in Iraq,
###4389 we probably would have been able to prevent that.
###4392 But he failed to achieve that as well. Again —
###4395 [Raddatz] Let me ask you quickly,
###4396 what's your criteria for intervention?
###4398 [Biden] I don't — yeah.
###4399 [Ryan] In Syria?
###4400 [Raddatz] Worldwide.
###4402 [Ryan] What is in the national interests of the American people.
###4403 [Raddatz] How about humanitarian interests?
###4405 [Ryan] What is in the national security of the American people
###4407 — it's got to be in the strategic national interests of our country.
###4409 [Raddatz] No humanitarian?
###4411 [Ryan] Each situation will — will come up with its own set of circumstances.
###4415 But putting American troops on the ground,
###4417 that's got to be within the national security interests of the American people.
###4422 [Raddatz] I want to — we're almost out of time here.
###4425 [Ryan] That means things like embargoes and sanctions and overflights
###4427 — those are things that don't put American troops on the ground.
###4431 But if you're talking about putting American troops on the ground,
###4433 only in our national security interests.
###4436 [Raddatz] I want to move on,
###4438 and I want to return home for these last few questions.
###4440 This debate is indeed historic.
###4442 We have 2 Catholic candidates, first time on a stage such as this,
###4448 and I would like to ask you both to tell me
###4450 what role your religion has played in your own personal views on abortion.
###4457 Please talk about how you came to that decision.
###4461 Talk about how your religion played a part in that.
###4465 And please, this is such an emotional issue for so many —
###4468 [Ryan] Sure.
###4469 [Raddatz] — people in this country.
###4471 Please talk personally about this if you could. Congressman Ryan.
###4477 [Ryan] I don't see how a person can separate their public life
###4480 from their private life or from their faith.
###4484 Our faith informs us in everything we do.
###4486 My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable,
###4490 about how to make sure that people have a chance in life.
###4494 Now, you want to ask basically why I'm pro-life?
###4498 It's not simply because of my Catholic faith.
###4501 That's a factor, of course, but it's also because of reason and science.
###4507 You know, I think about 10 1/2 years ago,
###4511 my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born
###4516 for our 7-week ultrasound for our firstborn child,
###4520 and we saw that heartbeat.
###4523 Our little baby was in the shape of a bean, and to this day,
###4527 we have nicknamed our firstborn child, Liza, "Bean." (Chuckles.)
###4533 Now, I believe that life begins at conception.
###4536 That's why — those are the reasons why I'm pro-life.
###4540 Now, I understand this is a difficult issue.
###4542 And I respect people who don't agree with me on this.
###4545 But the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortion
###4550 with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.
###4555 What troubles me more is how this administration has handled
###4559 all of these issues.
###4561 Look at what they're doing through "Obamacare"
###4564 with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country.
###4568 They're infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion,
###4573 by infringing on Catholic charities,
###4575 Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals.
###4579 Our church should not have to sue our federal government
###4581 to maintain their religious — religious liberties.
###4582 And with respect to abortion,
###4585 the Democratic Party used to say they want it to be safe, legal and rare.
###4589 Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding,
###4593 taxpayer funding in "Obamacare," taxpayer funding with foreign aid.
###4596 The vice-president himself went to China
###4598 and said that he sympathized or wouldn't second-guess
###4602 their 1-child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations.
###4606 That, to me, is pretty extreme.
###4609 [Raddatz] Vice President Biden.
###4612 [Biden] My religion defines who I am.
###4616 And I've been a practicing Catholic my whole life.
###4622 And it has particularly informed my social doctrine.
###4625 Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of those who
###4629 — who can't take care of themselves, people who need help.
###4635 With regard to
###4637 — with regard to abortion, I accept my church's position on abortion as a
###4643 — what we call de fide doctrine.
###4646 Life begins at conception. That's the church's judgment.
###4648 I accept it in my personal life.
###4651 But I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews
###4656 and — I just refuse to impose that on others,
###4659 unlike my friend here, the congressman.
###4663 I — I do not believe that — that we have a right to tell other people
###4670 that women, they — they can't control their body.
###4673 It's a decision between them and their doctor, in my view.
###4676 And the Supreme Court — I'm not going to interfere with that.
###4679 With regard to the assault on the Catholic Church,
###4683 let me make it absolutely clear.
###4686 No religious institution, Catholic or otherwise,
###4688 including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital,
###4691 Mercy — any hospital — none has to either refer contraception.
###4697 None has to pay for contraception.
###4700 None has to be a vehicle to get contraception
###4704 in any insurance policy they provide.
###4706 That is a fact. That is a fact.
###4709 Now, with regard to the way in which the — we differ,
###4714 my friend says that he —
###4720 well, I guess he accepts Governor Romney's position now,
###4722 because in the past he has argued that there was
###4727 — there's rape and forcible rape.
###4729 He's argued that, in the case of rape or incest,
###4732 it was still — it would be a crime to engage in having an abortion.
###4736 I just fundamentally disagree with my friend.
###4740 [Raddatz] Congressman Ryan.
###4741 [Ryan] All I'm saying is if you believe that life begins at conception,
###4745 that therefore doesn't change the definition of life.
###4748 That's a principle.
###4750 The policy of a Romney administration is to oppose abortion
###4752 with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.
###4757 Now, I've got to take issue with the Catholic Church and religious liberty.
###4762 [Biden] You have, on the issue of Catholic social doctrine, taken issue.
###4766 [Ryan] If they — if they agree with you, then why would they keep —
###4768 why would they keep suing you?
###4770 It's a distinction without a difference.
###4772 [Raddatz] I want to go back to the abortion question here.
###4774 If the Romney-Ryan ticket is elected,
###4776 should those who believe that abortion should remain legal be worried?
###4781 [Ryan] We don't think that unelected judges should make this decision;
###4785 that people, through their elected representatives
###4788 and reaching a consensus in society through the democratic process,
###4791 should make this determination.
###4793 [Biden] The court
###4795 — the next president will get 1 or 2 Supreme Court nominees.
###4798 That's how close Roe v. Wade is.
###4803 Just ask yourself:
###4805 With Robert Bork being the chief adviser on the court for — for Mr. Romney,
###4812 who do you think he's likely to appoint?
###4814 Do you think he's likely to appoint someone like Scalia
###4818 or someone else on the court, far right, that would outlaw Planned
###4822 — excuse me — outlaw abortion?
###4825 I suspect that would happen.
###4827 I guarantee you that will not happen.
###4829 We picked 2 people. We picked people who are open-minded.
###4832 They've been good justices.
###4834 So keep an eye on the Supreme Court —
###4836 [Ryan] Was there a litmus test on them?
###4837 [Biden] There was no litmus test.
###4839 We picked people who had an open mind, did not come with an agenda.
###4843 [Raddatz] I'm going to move on to this closing question
###4845 because we are running out of time.
###4847 It's certainly known — you've said it here tonight —
###4850 that the 2 of you respect our troops enormously.
###4853 Your son has served, and perhaps someday
###4856 your children will serve as well.
###4858 I recently spoke to a highly decorated soldier
###4862 who said that this presidential campaign has left him dismayed.
###4866 He told me, quote,
###4867 "The ads are so negative and they are all tearing down each other,
###4871 rather than building up the country."
###4872 What would you say to that American hero about this campaign?
###4876 And at the end of the day, are you ever embarrassed by the tone?
###4882 Vice President Biden.
###4885 [Biden] I would say to him the same thing I say to my son,
###4889 who did serve year in Iraq:
###4891 that we only have one truly sacred obligation as a government.
###4897 That's to equip those we send into harm's way
###4899 and care for those who come home.
###4902 That's the only sacred obligation we have.
###4904 Everything else falls behind that.
###4907 I would also tell him that the fact that he,
###4913 this decorated soldier you talked about,
###4917 fought for his country — that that should be honored.
###4921 He should not be thrown into a category
###4923 of the 47% who don't pay their taxes while he was out there fighting
###4928 and not having to pay taxes and somehow not taking responsibility.
###4932 I would also tell him that there are things
###4935 that have occurred in this campaign and occur in every campaign
###4938 that I'm sure both of us regret anyone having said,
###4942 particularly in these special new groups that can go out there,
###4947 raise all the money they want, not have to identify themselves
###4950 and say the most scurrilous things about the other candidate.
###4954 It's — it's — it's an abomination.
###4956 But the bottom line here is
###4957 I'd ask that hero you reference to take a look
###4961 at whether or not Governor Romney or President Obama has the conviction
###4968 to help lift up the middle class,
###4971 restore them to where they were before this Great Recession hit
###4974 and they got wiped out
###4975 or whether or not he's going to continue to focus
###4978 on taking care of only the very wealthy,
###4981 not asking them to make — pay any part of the deal
###4984 to bring the — bring back the middle class, the economy of this country.
###4987 I would ask him to take a look at
###4990 whether the president of the United States has acted wisely
###4992 in the use of force
###4995 and whether or not the slipshod comments being made
###4998 by my — my friend or by Governor Romney
###5000 serve — serve our interests very well.
###5004 But there are things that have been said in campaigns
###5008 that I — I find not very appealing.
###5012 [Raddatz] Congressman Ryan.
###5013 [Ryan] First of all, I'd thank him to his service to our country.
###5015 Second of all, I'd say,
###5017 we are not going to impose these devastating cuts on our military
###5019 which compromises their mission and their safety.
###5022 And then I would say,
###5023 you have a president who ran for president 4 years ago
###5027 promising hope and change
###5029 who has now turned his campaign into attack, blame and defame.
###5033 You see, if you don't have a good record to run on,
###5037 then you paint your opponent as someone to run from.
###5041 That was what President Obama said in 2008.
###5044 It's what he's doing right now.
###5046 Look at all the string of broken promises.
###5049 If you like your health care plan you can keep it
###5051 — try telling that to the 20 million people
###5053 who are projected to lose their health insurance
###5055 if "Obamacare" goes through
###5057 or the 7 point million — 7.4 million seniors who are going to lose it.
###5060 Or remember when he said this:
###5062 I guarantee if you make less than $250,000, your taxes won't go up.
###5066 Of the 21 tax increases in "Obamacare," 12 of them hit the middle class.
###5070 Or remember when he said, health insurance premiums will go down,
###5073 and $2,500 per family per year?
###5076 They've gone up 3,000 (dollars),
###5077 and they're expected to go up another 2,400 (dollars).
###5079 Or remember when he said, I promise by the end of my first term,
###5082 I'll cut the deficit in half in 4 years?
###5085 We've had 4 budgets, 4 trillion-dollar deficits.
###5090 A debt crisis is coming.
###5092 We can't keep spending and borrowing like this.
###5095 We can't just keep spending money we don't have.
###5098 Leaders run to problems to fix problems.
###5101 President Obama has not even put a credible plan on the table in any — any of his four years to deal with this debt crisis.
###5108 I passed 2 budgets to deal with this.
###5110 Mitt Romney has put 5 ideas on the table.
###5112 We've got to tackle this debt crisis before it tackles us.
###5115 The president likes to say he has a plan. He gave a speech.
###5119 We asked his budget office, can we see the plan?
###5121 They sent us to this press secretary.
###5123 He gave us a copy of the speech.
###5125 We asked the Congressional Budget Office,
###5126 tell us what President Obama's plan is to prevent a debt crisis.
###5128 They said, it's a speech; we can't estimate speeches.
###5131 You see? That's what we get in this administration: speeches.
###5136 But we're not getting leadership.
###5137 Mitt Romney is uniquely qualified to fix these problems.
###5142 His lifetime of experience, his proven track record of bipartisanship —
###5146 and what do we have from the president?
###5148 He broke his big promise to bring people together
###5150 to solve the country's biggest problems.
###5152 And what I would tell him is we don't have to settle for this.
###5155 [Raddatz] I — I —
###5156 [Ryan] We can do better than this.
###5157 [Biden] I hope I'll get equal time.
###5159 [Raddatz] I — you will get just a few minutes here, a few seconds, really.
###5162 [Biden] The 2 budgets the congressman introduced have eviscerated
###5167 all the things that the middle class cares about.
###5170 It has knocked 19 — it will knock 19 million people off of Medicare.
###5174 It will kick 200,000 children off of early education.
###5178 It will eliminate the tax credit people have
###5180 to be able to send their children to college.
###5183 It cuts education by $450 billion.
###5187 It — it — it does — it does virtually nothing,
###5190 except continue to increase the tax cuts for the very wealthy.
###5195 And, you know, we've had enough of this.
###5197 My — the idea that these — so concerned about these deficits,
###5201 I pointed out, he voted to put 2 wars on a credit card. He did —
###5205 [Raddatz] We're — we're going - We're going to the closing statements in a minute.
###5207 [Ryan] But let me — just a second —
###5208 [Raddatz] I — you're going to have your closing —
###5210 [Ryan] Not raising taxes is not cutting taxes. And by the way, our budget —
###5214 [Biden] We have not raised —
###5215 [Ryan] — we increased spending by 3% a year
###5216 instead of 4.5 % like they proposed.
###5219 [Raddatz] Let me — let me calm down things here just for a minute.
###5223 [Ryan] So not spending more money as much as they say is not a spending cut.
###5225 [Raddatz]  And I want to talk to you very briefly
###5227 before we go to closing statements about your own personal character.
###5228 If you are elected, what could you both give to this country as a man,
###5233 as a human being that no one else could?
###5237 [Ryan] Honesty. No one else could?
###5239 There are plenty of fine people who could lead this country.
###5242 But what you need are people who,
###5244 when they say they're going to do something, they go do it.
###5247 What you need are when people see problems,
###5251 they offer solutions to fix those problems.
###5253 We're not getting that.
###5255 Look, we can grow this economy faster.
###5257 That's what our 5-Point plan for a stronger middle class is all about.
###5259 It's about getting 12 million jobs,
###5261 higher take-home pay;
###5263 getting people out of poverty, into the middle class.
###5265 That means going with proven pro-growth policies that we know work
###5268 to get people back to work, putting ideas on the table,
###5271 working with Democrats — that actually works sometimes —
###5274 and then getting things done.
###5275 [Raddatz] Vice President, could we get to that
###5277 — to that issue of what you could bring as a man, a human being?
###5280 And I really am going to keep you to about 15 seconds here.
###5282 [Biden] Well, he gets 40, I get 15, but that's OK. That's all right.
###5285 [Raddatz] He didn't have 40. He didn't have 40.
###5287 [Biden] Now, let me tell you, I — my — my record stands for itself.
###5290 I never say anything I don't mean.
###5292 Everybody knows whatever I say, I do.
###5295 And my whole life has been devoted to leveling the playing field
###5299 for middle-class people, giving them an even break,
###5302 treating Main Street and Wall Street the same,
###5304 holding the same responsibility.
###5306 Look at my record.
###5308 It's been all about the middle class.
###5310 They're the people who grow this country.
###5312 We think you grow this country from the middle out,
###5314 not from the top down.
###5316 [Raddatz] OK. We now turn to the candidates for their closing statements.
###5319 Thank you, gentlemen.
###5321 And that coin toss, again,
###5322 has Vice President Biden starting with a closing statement.
###5325 [Biden] Well, let — let — let me say at the outset
###5327 that I want to thank you, Martha, for doing this, and Centre College.
###5331 The fact is that we're in a situation
###5335 where we inherited a god-awful circumstance.
###5340 People are in real trouble.
###5342 We acted to move to bring relief to the people who need the most help now.
###5347 And — and in the process, we — in case you haven't noticed, we have strong disagreements.
###5353 But I — you probably detected my frustration with their attitude
###5358 about the — the American people.
###5361 My friend says that 30% of the American people are takers.
###5364 They — Romney points out, 47%of the people
###5367 won't take responsibility.
###5370 He's talking about my mother and father.
###5372 And he's talking about the places I grew up in,
###5374 my neighbors in Scranton and Claymont.
###5375 He's talking about —
###5377 he's talking about the people that have built this country.
###5379 All they're looking for, Martha — all they're looking for is an even shot.
###5383 When they've been given the shot, they've done it.
###5386 They've done it.
###5387 Whenever you level the playing field, they've been able to move.
###5389 And they want a little bit of peace of mind.
###5391 And the president and I are not going to rest
###5394 until that playing field is leveled,
###5397 they in fact have a clear shot and they have peace of mind,
###5400 until they can turn to their kid and say with a degree of confidence,
###5403 honey, it's going to be OK. It's going to be OK.
###5407 That's what this is all about.
###5411 [Raddatz] Congressman Ryan.
###5412 [Ryan] I want to thank you as well, Martha, Danville, Kentucky, Centre College.
###5416 And I want to thank you, Joe.
###5418 It's been an honor to engage in this critical debate.
###5422 We face a very big choice. What kind of country are we going to be?
###5427 What kind of country are we going to give our kids?
###5431 President Obama — he had his chance.
###5434 He made his choices.
###5436 His economic agenda, more spending, more borrowing, higher taxes,
###5440 a government takeover of health care — it's not working.
###5444 It's failed to create the jobs we need.
###5446 23 million Americans are struggling for work today.
###5449 15% of Americans are in poverty.
###5453 This is not what a real recovery looks like.
###5456 You deserve better. Mitt Romney and I want to earn your support.
###5462 We're offering real reforms for a real recovery for every American.
###5467 Mitt Romney, his experience, his ideas, his solutions,
###5472 is uniquely qualified to get this job done.
###5476 At a time when we have a jobs crisis in America,
###5478 wouldn't it be nice to have a job creator in the White House?
###5481 The choice is clear:
###5483 a stagnant economy that promotes more government dependency,
###5488 or a dynamic, growing economy that promotes opportunity and jobs.
###5493 Mitt Romney and I will not duck the tough issues.
###5497 And we will not blame others for the next 4 years. We will take responsibility.
###5502 And we will not try to replace our founding principles;
###5506 we will reapply our founding principles.
###5509 The choice is clear, and the choice rests with you,
###5513 and we ask you for your vote. Thank you.
###5517 [Raddatz] And thank you both again. Thank you very much.
###5519 [Raddatz] This concludes the vice presidential debate.
###5522 Please tune in next Tuesday for the second presidential debate
###5526 at Hofstra University in New York.
###5528 I'm Martha Raddatz of ABC News.
###5530 I do hope all of you go to the polls. Have a good evening. (Applause.)
