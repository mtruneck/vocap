###26 HAMILTON MORRIS: That morning, I wake to find a gaping burn
###30 in my forearm oozing a purulent gleet.
###35 I stir and begin to vomit, begging for an antidote.
###41 I find Jean-Claude sitting next to me.
###44 And he encourages me to remember that the
###48 antidote is my mind.
###50 
###55 Alex knows a bokor who knows a bokor, who knows a bokor in
###61 Artibonite.
###63 So we drive for many hours until the road disintegrates
###67 and the wheels of our Mitsubishi Montero
###70 will turn no more.
###71 
###75 The peristyle is located over five miles
###78 from the nearest road.
###79 And we cross the path in the midday sun without water, each
###83 step bringing me closer to heat stroke,
###86 collapse, and death.
###88 
###91 The ground is still wet from the previous night's rain, and
###94 the air vibrates with bloodthirsty insects.
###99 Alex tells me that this region is notorious for the use and
###103 sale of zombie slaves and that the bokor we have come to
###107 visit might even keep some in his rice fields.
###110 
###112 After hours of walking, I enter the bokor's peristyle
###116 surrounded by goats, mango trees, and a
###119 fence of living cacti.
###120 
###123 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###126 HAMILTON MORRIS: I'm introduced
###127 to the bokor, Crescent.
###129 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###132 HAMILTON MORRIS: Unlike the last bokor, Crescent carries
###134 himself with total confidence, like he has nothing to prove.
###138 He's laid back.
###139 And looks at me in such a way as to suggest not only that he
###143 knows, but that he knows I know he knows.
###148 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###149 
###154 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###155 
###163 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###164 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###166 
###176 HAMILTON MORRIS: Could I see the bottle?
###177 ALEX: Not the powder, the bottle, right?
###179 HAMILTON MORRIS: Yeah.
###180 
###185 I hold the glass bottle with no more than 300 milligrams of
###188 beige powder.
###190 It's impossible to say anything about its potency or
###193 authenticity just from looking at it.
###195 But it's still exhilarating--
###197 my first glimpse of the legendary powder.
###199 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###203 HAMILTON MORRIS: Crescent dares me to try the powder.
###206 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###207 HAMILTON MORRIS: Casually mentioning he is equipped with
###210 a powerful antidote.
###211 
###214 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###216 
###226 HAMILTON MORRIS: Ask him how confident he is that he'll be
###230 able to reverse the effects with a lemon.
###233 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###234 
###243 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###245 ALEX: He said, yeah, he's sure that you
###247 won't have any problem.
###249 HAMILTON MORRIS: OK.
###249 What is your thought on this, Alex?
###252 ALEX: You know, for myself, I was offering to try it.
###254 But if you are, too, you can go for it.
###258 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###259 
###268 HAMILTON MORRIS: When he suggests I use the powder, I'm
###270 torn between scientific skepticism and the desire not
###274 to die an agonizing death deep in the Haitian countryside.
###279 I decide Crescent is offering me the poison as a test.
###282 Should I demonstrate my strength, I will
###283 have gained his trust.
###285 And should I be wrong, Crescent assures me that he
###288 has an effective antidote on hand, one half of a key lime.
###293 
###299 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###301 
###306 HAMILTON MORRIS: Though the lime provides me with little
###307 comfort, even the most well-equipped hospitals in the
###311 world have no antidote for TTX, because thus far, one
###315 does not exist.
###317 Ask him what the dose is.
###319 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###321 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###323 ALEX: Some of the feather.
###326 The feather with take some.
###327 
###332 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###333 
###336 HAMILTON MORRIS: Crescent frowns and leans away for me,
###339 insisting that I do not let any catch wind
###341 and blow onto him.
###343 Some powder is on the end of the feather.
###346 I dip the chicken feather into the glass bottle, allowing a
###350 mote of beige poison to cling to a single barbule.
###354 
###356 I brush the mote of zombie poison onto my arm.
###360 
###367 I don't feel anything at all.
###372 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###373 
###376 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###377 
###383 HAMILTON MORRIS: That's going to be a lot.
###386 Crescent changes his attitude and leans in towards me.
###390 He grabs the bottle and pushes the mouth to my skin, turning
###394 it upside down, revealing a ring of white powder the size
###398 of a quarter.
###401 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###403 
###410 HAMILTON MORRIS: Over the course of six minutes, I allow
###412 the powder to dissolve on the wet, hot skin of my forearm
###415 with two millimeters of skin between the powder and my
###418 thirsty Russian capillaries.
###420 
###422 I am not a hypochondriac, but there is nothing that will
###425 make you more aware of your throbbing, roiling, bubbling
###428 physiology than waiting for one of the world's most potent
###430 neurotoxins to kick in.
###433 Reeling through a mental checklist of symptoms, I am
###435 still not experiencing anything.
###438 ALEX: What do you feel like?
###439 
###441 HAMILTON MORRIS: I don't feel anything at all, other than I
###445 feel some mild terror that I'm going to
###451 die, but nothing distinct.
###455 The powder is ceremonially removed from
###457 my arm with a lime.
###459 The poison is encircled and then circumscribed with two
###462 strokes forming a cross and that's all.
###466 If the powder did contain TTX, the ascorbic acid in the lime
###470 would have only increased its water solubility and helped it
###473 cross into my blood.
###474 But even then, not enough time has passed for the paralysis
###477 to have set in, unless the dose was truly massive, in
###481 which case, I will be dying shortly.
###485 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###486 
###492 HAMILTON MORRIS: As I wait for the TTX to present its
###494 symptoms, I feel it an appropriate time to breach the
###498 subject of zombie slaves.
###501 Well, thank him for allowing me to
###506 experiment with his powder.
###508 Ask him if there are zombies in the building behind us.
###512 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###513 
###520 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###522 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###524 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###525 
###529 HAMILTON MORRIS: After negotiating a price with
###531 Crescent, we agree to donate a generous sum to his peristyle
###536 in honor of the Loa, Jean Zombie.
###538 
###545 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###546 
###579 HAMILTON MORRIS: Entranced, Crescent begins a ritualized
###582 door knocking and key jingling ritual, finally pausing before
###586 a locked door I have looked at all day.
###589 
###628 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###630 -[MOANING AND MUMBLING]
###668 HAMILTON MORRIS: Alex, can you ask him what's beneath the
###670 cloth?
###671 -[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###672 
###680 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###682 
###706 WADE DAVIS: The first thing you have to do when you start
###708 thinking about zombies or vodou is step
###711 outside of the cliches.
###714 And this really forced me to realize that, you know, I
###717 might be on the outside looking at the zombie thing in
###720 a certain perspective.
###722 But when you're on the inside, Narcisse, or a Haitian like
###727 himself, wasn't sitting there thinking, do or
###730 do not zombies exist?
###732 I mean, he knew in the very fiber of his being since
###735 childhood that zombies existed.
###737 He knew exactly how one was created.
###739 He knew exactly why one was created.
###741 And so, that's sort of the template upon which all these
###746 drugs are going to work.
###749 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###751 
###767 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###771 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###772 
###774 HAMILTON MORRIS: To our surprise, the Loa Jean Zombie
###777 refuses to take the local currency.
###780 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###782 
###788 HAMILTON MORRIS: Crescent is irate, but tells us he will
###790 have prepared a new poison the following Saturday.
###795 CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
