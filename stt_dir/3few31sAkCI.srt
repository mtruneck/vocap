1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,41
EDDIE HUANG: Yo, I'm
Eddie Huang, and


2
0:0:1,41 --> 0:0:2,66
I got high on munchies.


3
0:0:2,66 --> 0:0:9,23



4
0:0:9,23 --> 0:0:11,57
I got to make fun of my boy
eating a pear in a men's


5
0:0:11,57 --> 0:0:12,13
locker room.


6
0:0:12,13 --> 0:0:14,1
I got to tell plan B jokes.


7
0:0:14,1 --> 0:0:17,16
I told jokes about panda shit.


8
0:0:17,16 --> 0:0:18,88
You can't really do that
anywhere else.


9
0:0:18,88 --> 0:0:19,66
It's fun.


10
0:0:19,66 --> 0:0:20,89
And we're not knuckleheads.


11
0:0:20,89 --> 0:0:22,38
We're not idiots.


12
0:0:22,38 --> 0:0:25,83
We are telling stories that mean
something, but in our own


13
0:0:25,83 --> 0:0:26,39
vernacular.


14
0:0:26,39 --> 0:0:27,92
And that's what I really love.


15
0:0:27,92 --> 0:0:29,64
So there it is, the
whole shebang.


16
0:0:29,64 --> 0:0:31,71
Vice presents Munchies
with Eddie Huang.


17
0:0:31,71 --> 0:0:35,502



18
0:0:35,502 --> 0:0:38,312
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: This
famous cook?


19
0:0:38,312 --> 0:0:39,135
EDDIE HUANG: What is this?


20
0:0:39,135 --> 0:0:39,94
I don't know this.


21
0:0:39,94 --> 0:0:42,17
Oh, I would definitely
chef here.


22
0:0:42,17 --> 0:0:46,31
I'm going to create a
special health menu.


23
0:0:46,31 --> 0:0:49,84
EDDIE HUANG: Chinese juices,
dragon sweat,


24
0:0:49,84 --> 0:0:52,91
panda shit, the best.


25
0:0:52,91 --> 0:0:58,8



26
0:0:58,8 --> 0:1:0,5
Mmm.


27
0:1:0,5 --> 0:1:3,25



28
0:1:3,25 --> 0:1:4,819
My name is Eddie Huang.


29
0:1:4,819 --> 0:1:7,336
The name of my restaurant
is Baohaus, and we serve


30
0:1:7,336 --> 0:1:9,24
Taiwanese-style street food.


31
0:1:9,24 --> 0:1:14,49



32
0:1:14,49 --> 0:1:19,2
Bao just means bun or
bread in Chinese.


33
0:1:19,2 --> 0:1:20,89
Everybody has variations
on pork bun.


34
0:1:20,89 --> 0:1:23,42
But I was like, yo, let's take
a step back and do the OG


35
0:1:23,42 --> 0:1:26,34
shit, the real, authentic,
Taiwanese way they've been


36
0:1:26,34 --> 0:1:27,51
doing since the '50s.


37
0:1:27,51 --> 0:1:30,47
So I wanted to red cook the pork
and topping with peanuts


38
0:1:30,47 --> 0:1:32,94
and sugar and cilantro, like
how we do in Taiwan, and it


39
0:1:32,94 --> 0:1:34,93
just really took off.


40
0:1:34,93 --> 0:1:38,31
It's not like my mission in
life was to open a bao


41
0:1:38,31 --> 0:1:38,93
restaurant.


42
0:1:38,93 --> 0:1:41,85
This was the item that
made the most sense.


43
0:1:41,85 --> 0:1:43,9
It's portable.


44
0:1:43,9 --> 0:1:45,72
It's the Asian answer
to a taco.


45
0:1:45,72 --> 0:1:47,64
The names for the
baos are cool.


46
0:1:47,64 --> 0:1:50,43
The original's named after
Chairman Mao, because Mao's


47
0:1:50,43 --> 0:1:50,98
from Hunan.


48
0:1:50,98 --> 0:1:54,86
And my technique for the
red-cooked pork belly is from


49
0:1:54,86 --> 0:1:56,14
Hunan the province.


50
0:1:56,14 --> 0:1:58,18
That's where my family's from.


51
0:1:58,18 --> 0:2:0,57
And then we got the
bird house bao.


52
0:2:0,57 --> 0:2:1,27
It's chicken.


53
0:2:1,27 --> 0:2:3,79
The inspiration for that was
Robin Givens because she's the


54
0:2:3,79 --> 0:2:5,1
biggest bird in the world.


55
0:2:5,1 --> 0:2:6,215
I hate that bitch.


56
0:2:6,215 --> 0:2:9,259
Ruined Mike Tyson.


57
0:2:9,259 --> 0:2:12,55
So yeah, we're going to go hang
out with detective Max


58
0:2:12,55 --> 0:2:12,9
Koshkerman.


59
0:2:12,9 --> 0:2:14,87
He always sounds like he's
interrogating people.


60
0:2:14,87 --> 0:2:16,646
MAX KOSHKERMAN: What do you got
for breakfast, a salad?


61
0:2:16,646 --> 0:2:20,52
EDDIE HUANG: The other dude
is Simonez Wolf, Chef Sez.


62
0:2:20,52 --> 0:2:23,1
I know Sez from the
door at Le Band.


63
0:2:23,1 --> 0:2:25,52
He's always clowning
motherfuckers outside, not


64
0:2:25,52 --> 0:2:27,4
letting anybody in.


65
0:2:27,4 --> 0:2:28,95
He's a funny cat.


66
0:2:28,95 --> 0:2:29,25
EMILE HAYNIE: How's it going?


67
0:2:29,25 --> 0:2:31,34
EDDIE HUANG: This motherfucker
is the latest one man.


68
0:2:31,34 --> 0:2:32,32
What's wrong with you?


69
0:2:32,32 --> 0:2:33,55
You all know Emile.


70
0:2:33,55 --> 0:2:34,8
He produced "Runaway".


71
0:2:34,8 --> 0:2:36,76
He produced Lana Del
Rey's new album.


72
0:2:36,76 --> 0:2:40,755
Honestly, we should just eat the
fucking, that new pot pie.


73
0:2:40,755 --> 0:2:42,81
That new KFC pot pie
is the moves.


74
0:2:42,81 --> 0:2:44,64
Really we all just hang out.


75
0:2:44,64 --> 0:2:46,8
And we like to eat.


76
0:2:46,8 --> 0:2:47,96
So we're going to go
eat at Nan Xiang


77
0:2:47,96 --> 0:2:50,92
Shanghai-style breakfast.


78
0:2:50,92 --> 0:2:52,17
After you Mr. Jimenez.


79
0:2:52,17 --> 0:2:58,0



80
0:2:58,0 --> 0:3:2,3
So Flushing's an interesting
neighborhood because a lot of


81
0:3:2,3 --> 0:3:3,42
people feel like the
best Chinese


82
0:3:3,42 --> 0:3:5,46
food comes from Taiwan.


83
0:3:5,46 --> 0:3:8,1
After the revolution,
most Chinese master


84
0:3:8,1 --> 0:3:9,65
chefs fled to Taiwan.


85
0:3:9,65 --> 0:3:12,475
They came to New York, set
up shop in Flushing.


86
0:3:12,475 --> 0:3:13,34
SIMONEZ WOLF: Which way?


87
0:3:13,34 --> 0:3:14,16
You know the way.


88
0:3:14,16 --> 0:3:16,25
EDDIE HUANG: First restaurant
we went to was Nan


89
0:3:16,25 --> 0:3:17,21
Xiang Xiao Long Bao.


90
0:3:17,21 --> 0:3:20,19
They do the best Shanghainese
breakfast I've had in New York


91
0:3:20,19 --> 0:3:22,99
hands down.


92
0:3:22,99 --> 0:3:23,62
Deep bow.


93
0:3:23,62 --> 0:3:24,126
Deep bow.


94
0:3:24,126 --> 0:3:25,2
Deep bow.


95
0:3:25,2 --> 0:3:26,27
That's a dismissive one.


96
0:3:26,27 --> 0:3:32,29



97
0:3:32,29 --> 0:3:37,57
[SPEAKING CHINESE]


98
0:3:37,57 --> 0:3:39,79
EDDIE HUANG: You think Chinese
breakfast, and everybody just


99
0:3:39,79 --> 0:3:40,685
assumes dim sum.


100
0:3:40,685 --> 0:3:43,6
But dim sum is a Cantonese
thing, southern


101
0:3:43,6 --> 0:3:45,7
China on the coast.


102
0:3:45,7 --> 0:3:48,3
A lot of the rest of the eastern
coast of China, people


103
0:3:48,3 --> 0:3:52,5
like to eat soup dumplings,
hot soy milk, cruellers.


104
0:3:52,5 --> 0:3:55,21
These are dishes that you
don't usually see in the


105
0:3:55,21 --> 0:3:56,8
American canon of
Chinese food.


106
0:3:56,8 --> 0:3:59,35
So I like people to see
it because that's


107
0:3:59,35 --> 0:4:0,262
what I grew up with.


108
0:4:0,262 --> 0:4:1,54
MAX KOSHKERMAN: I'll
tell you what man.


109
0:4:1,54 --> 0:4:3,23
Only eat fresh soy milk.


110
0:4:3,23 --> 0:4:4,28
People don't even understand--


111
0:4:4,28 --> 0:4:5,146
EDDIE HUANG: Game over, dude.


112
0:4:5,146 --> 0:4:5,93
Game over.


113
0:4:5,93 --> 0:4:7,18
MAX KOSHKERMAN: --how
incredible it is.


114
0:4:7,18 --> 0:4:9,63
EDDIE HUANG: This is a beef
scallion pancake, one of my


115
0:4:9,63 --> 0:4:10,88
favorite dishes.


116
0:4:10,88 --> 0:4:15,1



117
0:4:15,1 --> 0:4:18,98
This dish, it's beef and tripe
together, spicy oil.


118
0:4:18,98 --> 0:4:22,76
But the folk name for
it is [CHINESE],


119
0:4:22,76 --> 0:4:24,42
husband and wife platter.


120
0:4:24,42 --> 0:4:27,94



121
0:4:27,94 --> 0:4:30,5
Now soup dumpling 101.


122
0:4:30,5 --> 0:4:31,7
I'm going to show this.


123
0:4:31,7 --> 0:4:34,64
You see a lot of goons poking
holes right in the top.


124
0:4:34,64 --> 0:4:35,37
Hooligans.


125
0:4:35,37 --> 0:4:36,9
This is what you do.


126
0:4:36,9 --> 0:4:38,85
Soup dumpling gets a sauna.


127
0:4:38,85 --> 0:4:40,37
You put it in the vinegar.


128
0:4:40,37 --> 0:4:43,8
Let it chill out, maybe 30
seconds to a minute.


129
0:4:43,8 --> 0:4:43,81
It'll cool.


130
0:4:43,81 --> 0:4:44,4
Then you eat it.


131
0:4:44,4 --> 0:4:45,89
This is the only way to do it.


132
0:4:45,89 --> 0:4:46,935
You do it any other way--


133
0:4:46,935 --> 0:4:48,8
MAX KOSHKERMAN: Don't
be a hooligan--


134
0:4:48,8 --> 0:4:49,15
EDDIE HUANG: Don't be
a fucking hooligan.


135
0:4:49,15 --> 0:4:50,245
MAX KOSHKERMAN: --while eating
a soup dumpling.


136
0:4:50,245 --> 0:4:50,82
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.


137
0:4:50,82 --> 0:4:53,17
And you see all these
motherfuckers on Facebook, oh


138
0:4:53,17 --> 0:4:54,84
my favorite food is
soup dumplings.


139
0:4:54,84 --> 0:4:57,1
They're like poking
them like this.


140
0:4:57,1 --> 0:4:59,352
MAX KOSHKERMAN: Respect
the dumpling.


141
0:4:59,352 --> 0:4:59,89
Don't be a hooligan.


142
0:4:59,89 --> 0:5:0,716
SIMONEZ WOLF: Can I do this?


143
0:5:0,716 --> 0:5:1,122
This is good?


144
0:5:1,122 --> 0:5:2,34
MAX KOSHKERMAN: I don't know.


145
0:5:2,34 --> 0:5:7,51
EDDIE HUANG: That looks like
some crazy French shit.


146
0:5:7,51 --> 0:5:9,94
See, I should host a show
teaching people how to do this


147
0:5:9,94 --> 0:5:13,7
called, "So You Think You Want
to be a Chinaman." "So You


148
0:5:13,7 --> 0:5:17,12
Think You Can Chinaman."
Oh thank you.


149
0:5:17,12 --> 0:5:18,37
Thank you grasshopper.

[SPEAKING CHINESE]


152
0:5:24,61 --> 0:5:27,54
EDDIE HUANG: Oh and then after
that, we went to probably the


153
0:5:27,54 --> 0:5:29,93
best Cantonese restaurant in
any of the five boroughs,


154
0:5:29,93 --> 0:5:31,18
Imperial Palace.


155
0:5:31,18 --> 0:5:38,704



156
0:5:38,704 --> 0:5:40,68
MAX KOSHKERMAN: Respect
for that.


157
0:5:40,68 --> 0:5:41,668
I can't reach that.


158
0:5:41,668 --> 0:5:43,16
Oh now hold on.


159
0:5:43,16 --> 0:5:44,14
SIMONEZ WOLF: Oh ninja.


160
0:5:44,14 --> 0:5:47,285
Oh, can't reach you.

EDDIE HUANG: [SPEAKING CHINESE]


162
0:5:54,5 --> 0:5:56,32
EDDIE HUANG: I got the
crab on rice, seafood


163
0:5:56,32 --> 0:5:58,12
on pan-fried noodles.


164
0:5:58,12 --> 0:5:59,57
I got a little fried grouper.


165
0:5:59,57 --> 0:6:0,923
I think we're good.


166
0:6:0,923 --> 0:6:2,51
MAX KOSHKERMAN: Is that
lobster in that?

are you saying?

170
0:6:5,84 --> 0:6:7,93
EDDIE HUANG: So Max was
being extra difficult.


171
0:6:7,93 --> 0:6:10,18
I usually don't go to restaurant
and order all


172
0:6:10,18 --> 0:6:11,91
fucking shellfish dishes.


173
0:6:11,91 --> 0:6:13,1
I asked Max what he wants.


174
0:6:13,1 --> 0:6:14,4
He goes, oh, lobster.


175
0:6:14,4 --> 0:6:16,24
Son, we're getting
dungeness crab.


176
0:6:16,24 --> 0:6:17,77
You still want to get lobster?


177
0:6:17,77 --> 0:6:19,69
He's like, I only want
to eat lobster.


178
0:6:19,69 --> 0:6:20,74
He wants lobster.


179
0:6:20,74 --> 0:6:22,48
He's going to be difficult
until he


180
0:6:22,48 --> 0:6:23,36
gets his fucking lobster.

try that Cantonese style.

not difficult.

only shellfish.


191
0:6:34,85 --> 0:6:36,554
That's some bowl of shit.


192
0:6:36,554 --> 0:6:38,482

over sticky rice there.


196
0:6:45,74 --> 0:6:48,94
They take a live dungeness crab,
butcher it live, take


197
0:6:48,94 --> 0:6:50,4
the top off.


198
0:6:50,4 --> 0:6:51,42
They'll take sticky rice.


199
0:6:51,42 --> 0:6:53,26
Then they'll throw it
in the wok a little.


200
0:6:53,26 --> 0:6:56,47
Then it goes on top of lotus
leaves into a bamboo steamer.

out there in any restaurant in

0:7:12,62 --> 0:7:19,66



212
0:7:19,66 --> 0:7:21,87
This shit is the best.


213
0:7:21,87 --> 0:7:25,74
So this is steamed oyster with
XO sauce, chili oil, dried


214
0:7:25,74 --> 0:7:29,714
scallop, all kinds
of good stuff.


215
0:7:29,714 --> 0:7:32,5
And then the fried rice dish
that we had was a salt fish


216
0:7:32,5 --> 0:7:33,42
fried rice.


217
0:7:33,42 --> 0:7:36,57
The protein that you see in
there is diced chicken bits.


218
0:7:36,57 --> 0:7:40,33
But the flavor for that fried
rice is coming from salt fish.


219
0:7:40,33 --> 0:7:41,866
And I think I just
said fried rice.


220
0:7:41,866 --> 0:7:43,154
[LAUGHS]


221
0:7:43,154 --> 0:7:44,53
EDDIE HUANG: That
Chinglish just


222
0:7:44,53 --> 0:7:46,27
pops its head up sometimes.


223
0:7:46,27 --> 0:7:47,615
So ugly.


224
0:7:47,615 --> 0:7:49,4
SIMONEZ WOLF: Oh look,
look, look.


225
0:7:49,4 --> 0:7:51,68
EDDIE HUANG: Oh here we go.


226
0:7:51,68 --> 0:7:54,31
I want you to take a photo
with your lobster.


227
0:7:54,31 --> 0:7:57,23



228
0:7:57,23 --> 0:8:1,56
Yo, if people knew Sim was
geeking out, taking food


229
0:8:1,56 --> 0:8:3,89
photos like that, I don't think
he could control any


230
0:8:3,89 --> 0:8:6,73
door in the city because
he stunts on everyone.


231
0:8:6,73 --> 0:8:8,11
He the coolest guy you know.


232
0:8:8,11 --> 0:8:11,865
But now he's got his Yelp on,
fucking taking photos of food


233
0:8:11,865 --> 0:8:12,83
for his blog.


234
0:8:12,83 --> 0:8:15,1
So it's a funny dynamic,
all of us.


235
0:8:15,1 --> 0:8:16,61
But we don't give a fuck.


236
0:8:16,61 --> 0:8:18,79
We'll geek out over shit.


237
0:8:18,79 --> 0:8:19,47
We act a fool.


238
0:8:19,47 --> 0:8:23,12
Anywhere we go, you
see we act a fool.


239
0:8:23,12 --> 0:8:25,73
After Imperial Palace,
Emile pussied out.


240
0:8:25,73 --> 0:8:26,9
He didn't want to
go to the Baths.


241
0:8:26,9 --> 0:8:30,454
SIMONEZ WOLF: You coming?


242
0:8:30,454 --> 0:8:32,854
EMILE HAYNIE: No,
definitely not.


243
0:8:32,854 --> 0:8:33,301
No.


244
0:8:33,301 --> 0:8:35,59
EDDIE HUANG: So then we went
to the Russian Baths.


245
0:8:35,59 --> 0:8:37,32
Just sweat it out, because we
felt gross from all that food.


246
0:8:37,32 --> 0:8:40,266



247
0:8:40,266 --> 0:8:41,46
How are you Simonez?


248
0:8:41,46 --> 0:8:44,212
We are here at the Russian
Baths right now.


249
0:8:44,212 --> 0:8:45,67
SIMONEZ WOLF: Whoa
whoa, gangsta.


250
0:8:45,67 --> 0:8:53,1



251
0:8:53,1 --> 0:8:56,43
EDDIE HUANG: Max was in there
with a bunch of dudes with no


252
0:8:56,43 --> 0:8:57,92
drawers on eating a pear.


253
0:8:57,92 --> 0:9:0,58
Definitely let the streets
know, that's Max's shit.


254
0:9:0,58 --> 0:9:2,294
See, he was eating
the fucking pear.


255
0:9:2,294 --> 0:9:4,31
You see him eating
the fucking pear.


256
0:9:4,31 --> 0:9:6,83
No better place to eat a pear
than in a locker room full of


257
0:9:6,83 --> 0:9:8,8
naked dudes.


258
0:9:8,8 --> 0:9:12,6



259
0:9:12,6 --> 0:9:14,9
Yo, I like to just get
blazed and sweat.


260
0:9:14,9 --> 0:9:15,81
It's kind of cool.


261
0:9:15,81 --> 0:9:17,67
It's the perfect thing to do
high because you don't have to


262
0:9:17,67 --> 0:9:19,2
think about anything.


263
0:9:19,2 --> 0:9:21,19
Your mind is just consumed
with sweating.


264
0:9:21,19 --> 0:9:23,17
And you feel like
you worked out.


265
0:9:23,17 --> 0:9:24,698
You feel like you burnt
some calories,


266
0:9:24,698 --> 0:9:25,29
even though you didn't.


267
0:9:25,29 --> 0:9:27,48
So we just fucking
go to the baths.


268
0:9:27,48 --> 0:9:31,101



269
0:9:31,101 --> 0:9:33,466
Look at this shit.


270
0:9:33,466 --> 0:9:38,75
Some intense negotiations going
on here at the baths.


271
0:9:38,75 --> 0:9:41,926
Max, the price is listed man.


272
0:9:41,926 --> 0:9:44,83
The prices are listed.


273
0:9:44,83 --> 0:9:47,51
Max is always fucking
negotiating with people.


274
0:9:47,51 --> 0:9:49,8
He don't ever want to pay
full price for anything.


275
0:9:49,8 --> 0:9:52,1
He'd go to Chipotle and fucking
negotiate if he could.


276
0:9:52,1 --> 0:9:54,646
MAX KOSHKERMAN: This plug, I
want one more round on the


277
0:9:54,646 --> 0:9:55,29
house next time I come here.


278
0:9:55,29 --> 0:9:56,69
EDDIE HUANG: These Persian
people are the cheapest.


279
0:9:56,69 --> 0:10:0,525
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah, but
he know how to deal.


280
0:10:0,525 --> 0:10:2,2
EDDIE HUANG: You should take
another photo here of him.


281
0:10:2,2 --> 0:10:3,185
Put it up.


282
0:10:3,185 --> 0:10:4,435
This man steals.


283
0:10:4,435 --> 0:10:7,9



284
0:10:7,9 --> 0:10:8,42
Stealing memberships.


285
0:10:8,42 --> 0:10:9,875
MAX KOSHKERMAN: I'll
see you later.


286
0:10:9,875 --> 0:10:10,845
EDDIE HUANG: Take care.


287
0:10:10,845 --> 0:10:12,89
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Good luck.


288
0:10:12,89 --> 0:10:15,16
EDDIE HUANG: After we went
to the baths, we


289
0:10:15,16 --> 0:10:16,5
just had the munchies.


290
0:10:16,5 --> 0:10:17,63
And we were like, what
could we make?


291
0:10:17,63 --> 0:10:21,48
We're going to go to Baohaus and
make fried bao ice cream


292
0:10:21,48 --> 0:10:22,36
sandwiches.


293
0:10:22,36 --> 0:10:24,414
It's going to be good.


294
0:10:24,414 --> 0:10:26,854
It's this way.


295
0:10:26,854 --> 0:10:28,81
MALE SPEAKER: We're happy, no.


296
0:10:28,81 --> 0:10:29,37
SIMONEZ WOLF: Neighborhood
watch.


297
0:10:29,37 --> 0:10:31,89
EDDIE HUANG: Damn, you just
stunted on him in front


298
0:10:31,89 --> 0:10:33,16
of his girl, yo.


299
0:10:33,16 --> 0:10:35,385
You stealing shorties tonight?


300
0:10:35,385 --> 0:10:36,635
You stealing shorties?


301
0:10:36,635 --> 0:10:38,74



302
0:10:38,74 --> 0:10:43,426
All right, we're going
to make this.


303
0:10:43,426 --> 0:10:48,36
Drop eight baos in the fryer.


304
0:10:48,36 --> 0:10:49,77
EDDIE HUANG: No, just for fun.


305
0:10:49,77 --> 0:10:50,46
You want one?


306
0:10:50,46 --> 0:10:51,4
We'll make one for you.


307
0:10:51,4 --> 0:10:52,18
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
Can I have one?


308
0:10:52,18 --> 0:10:53,88
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, we'll
make you one.


309
0:10:53,88 --> 0:10:54,55
No problem.


310
0:10:54,55 --> 0:10:56,158
MALE SPEAKER 2: Can
I have one too?


311
0:10:56,158 --> 0:10:58,56
EDDIE HUANG: Had them fried baos
with the red bean paste,


312
0:10:58,56 --> 0:11:2,83
the little shiso leaf, all
the finest greenery.


313
0:11:2,83 --> 0:11:5,88
And then vanilla ice cream or
green tea ice cream, depending


314
0:11:5,88 --> 0:11:7,44
on what your flavor is.


315
0:11:7,44 --> 0:11:8,86
Oh delicious.


316
0:11:8,86 --> 0:11:12,46
Here you go Sim.


317
0:11:12,46 --> 0:11:14,75
You want ice cream sandwiches?


318
0:11:14,75 --> 0:11:17,38
All right, come get it.


319
0:11:17,38 --> 0:11:19,19
Don't be shy.


320
0:11:19,19 --> 0:11:21,86
Y'all scared of ice
cream sandwiches?


321
0:11:21,86 --> 0:11:23,28
MALE SPEAKER 3: I'm a little
confused about this.


322
0:11:23,28 --> 0:11:24,92
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, what are
you confused about?


323
0:11:24,92 --> 0:11:27,72
It's fucking ice cream
and fried baos.


324
0:11:27,72 --> 0:11:29,72
What's there to be
confused about?


325
0:11:29,72 --> 0:11:34,3
We're going to feed the streets
right now, everybody.


326
0:11:34,3 --> 0:11:35,49
SIMONEZ WOLF: It's like a soup
kitchen for ice cream.


327
0:11:35,49 --> 0:11:36,8
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, it's
a soup kitchen.


328
0:11:36,8 --> 0:11:38,74
This is a ice cream
soup kitchen.


329
0:11:38,74 --> 0:11:39,64
Here you go.


330
0:11:39,64 --> 0:11:41,26
Enjoy man.


331
0:11:41,26 --> 0:11:43,185
Yeah man, motherfuckers
love free shit.


332
0:11:43,185 --> 0:11:44,69
They like anything free.


333
0:11:44,69 --> 0:11:46,858
I could've taken a shit
in a bao and they


334
0:11:46,858 --> 0:11:48,15
would've loved it.


335
0:11:48,15 --> 0:11:51,14
See this high munchie shit, it
doesn't need to be pretty.


336
0:11:51,14 --> 0:11:52,45
It just needs to be delicious.


337
0:11:52,45 --> 0:11:55,53



338
0:11:55,53 --> 0:11:56,39
It's a fucking recession.


339
0:11:56,39 --> 0:11:58,12
I'm going to feed people.


340
0:11:58,12 --> 0:12:0,63
I'm going to run on this
platform, ice cream.


341
0:12:0,63 --> 0:12:4,35
If your platform can be like,
no, you cannot use Plan B.


342
0:12:4,35 --> 0:12:5,87
I'll be like, I'm a nice guy.


343
0:12:5,87 --> 0:12:9,11
I want you to eat ice cream
and use Plan B.


344
0:12:9,11 --> 0:14:9,11
