###0 
###0 MALE SPEAKER: One, two, three.
###1 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###9 TRAVIS WAMMACK: It's the South.
###10 It's growing up poor, teaching yourself,
###13 playing from the heart.
###16 I don't think the sound that was
###18 created in here was planned.
###21 DONNIE FRITZ: The key word to me about Muscle
###24 Shoals, it's a groove.
###26 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###40 IAN SVENONIUS: Here we are.
###40 We're in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.
###42 Muscle Shoals is known for a lot of things.
###45 It's known for Reynolds Wrap.
###48 And it's known for being a swamp.
###51 But it's mostly known for American music.
###53 The studios Muscle Shoals Sound and Fame have produced,
###58 you know, Wilson Pickett records, Percy Sledge records,
###60 Rolling Stones, and everything up to Lynard Skynard, the
###65 Osmond's, and the group Alabama.
###67 We wanted to explore what made this region such a fertile
###71 musical region.
###73 We're talking to the people who have worked here, who've
###75 established Muscle Shoals, put it on the map.
###78 And we're going to talk to the young people who are trying to
###81 make their own way.
###82 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###84 IAN SVENONIUS: So much music now is based on the music that
###87 was made here.
###88 What are the central ingredients of that sound?
###91 DOC DAILEY: When I think of the Muscle Shoals sound, like,
###93 from the old recording era, I think more of an R&B feel.
###97 But that's kind of what I think about.
###99 I think it's probably more of a recording legacy.
###103 You know, we had all the great session players here and
###106 studios back in the day--
###107 white guys playing soul music.
###109 
###112 RICK HALL: We all started out as pickers.
###114 We all had our own bands and we all played gigs.
###118 And the odds were against us.
###120 We're recording in a town of 5,000 people where you only
###123 have four good guitar players.
###126 You only have three good song writers.
###129 It's a dry county.
###130 You can't buy booze or even beer here.
###133 And the thing we have going for us in spite of all of
###135 that, we were cutting hit records because we worked
###139 harder, longer, and were more driven, and felt the pressure
###144 to be competitive with the world.
###145 
###149 DONNIE FRITZ: We were just kids and learning.
###152 But it was a young business.
###155 It'd only been like three or four years since Elvis and all
###158 these guys from Memphis started.
###160 SCOTT BOYER: Yeah.
###161 IAN SVENONIUS: First of all, I want to asked how you got
###163 started, how you got the job?
###164 DAVID HOOD: Well, I started hanging around Fame which was
###167 just down the street from the store.
###168 I was working at my father's tire store.
###171 And my first union scale recording session was a hit, a
###175 gold record.
###175 And I had to start learning how to play
###176 the base after that.
###178 RICK HALL: We started out with a little funky
###181 demonstration studio.
###183 We stapled egg cartons on the walls.
###186 And that was in Florence, Alabama, that's where Fame got
###189 its name, of course, Florence, Alabama Music Enterprises.
###192 DAVID HOOD: This is the legendary Rick Hall who
###194 produced Arthur Alexander and the first hits that were from
###198 around here.
###199 He would find a song or an artist and go in and record
###203 that artist with that song.
###205 And then he'd go shop it and try to get it
###207 played on the radio.
###208 RICK HALL: I went on a tour.
###209 We called it the Great Vodka Tour.
###212 And any black station that had a tower, I'd take them a
###215 bottle of vodka, or a bottle of gin, or whatever.
###218 Then we left town and we're driving down the highway.
###221 And we took a swig a vodka.
###222 And said, hey.
###223 They're playing our record.
###224 IAN SVENONIUS: Yeah.
###225 RICK HALL: It also started out with black music.
###226 IAN SVENONIUS: Yeah.
###227 RICK HALL: And I want to make that clear.
###228 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###234 IAN SVENONIUS: Wilson Pickett came in.
###235 This was after he was in the Falcons and was--
###238 DAVID HOOD: Yes.
###239 They recorded "Midnight Hour" at Stax in Memphis.
###243 And it was their first big hit.
###245 And Jim Stewart, who owned Stax, said, well, look, we're
###249 not going to let you guys come back in here and record
###251 anymore stuff.
###252 I want everything to be for Stax that's recorded here.
###255 And so Jerry Wexler started looking for
###257 another place to record.
###258 And that's when he brought Pickett.
###260 What really got Muscle Shoals music happening was Jerry
###264 Wexler bringing Wilson Pickett and then
###266 later on, Aretha Franklin.
###268 
###272 RICK HALL: It's a little strange when you are a white
###274 cracker from the State of Alabama and you become known
###278 as a producer who produced only blacks acts.
###282 So when you get to the Rolling Stones, and Otis Redding, and
###285 on and on, you start to make your mark and
###287 the word gets out.
###288 Wait a minute?
###290 What's going on down in Muscle Shoals, Alabama?
###292 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###296 IAN SVENONIUS: What makes this area so musical or whatever?
###299 Or do you think it's anymore musical than any other places?
###302 DOC DAILEY: Oh, it's definitely more musical than
###304 other places.
###305 IAN SVENONIUS: Is it the water?
###306 DOC DAILEY: That's what they talk about, the singing river.
###308 IAN SVENONIUS: Really?
###309 The river?
###309 That's interesting.
###310 DOC DAILEY: Yes.
###310 That's what they say.
###311 There's supposedly an Indian legend that there's a lady in
###313 the river that sings.
###315 And you can actually hear her.
###317 IAN SVENONIUS: Does she sing well?
###318 DOC DAILEY: I've never heard her.
###319 [LAUGHTER]
###320 RICK HALL: People started migrating here from other
###323 areas of the country, from California, from Los Angeles,
###326 from New Orleans, and everywhere.
###327 DAVID HOOD: I think that they came here because they had
###331 heard a record or something, a hit that was recorded.
###334 And they came because they wanted a hit too.
###336 RICK HALL: So it's not where you're at, it's the
###339 determination you have.
###341 New York didn't want me and Los Angeles didn't want me.
###343 So it was either Muscle Shoals, or nothing.
###347 I just decided to plant myself here and said, look,
###349 I'm going to do it.
###350 I don't care if it was Wilson Pickett, or Clarence Carter,
###353 or Aretha Franklin, or Mack Davis, or Elvis Presley,
###356 whoever it was, if I was producing the record, the
###359 record became my record.
###362 And what you heard on the record was
###364 what I wanted to hear.
###366 TRAVIS WAMMACK: Back then, we were an exclusive for Fame.
###369 And we were punching the clock from 9:00 to
###371 I think 5:00 everyday.
###373 And you had to be busy.
###374 You had to be writing or doing something, you know.
###377 IAN SVENONIUS: The Fame Rhythm Section moved over to Muscle
###379 Shoals, started their own thing.
###381 Did you see that as like a threat to what you were doing
###384 or were you excited that this was becoming, like, growth of
###389 a new music center?
###390 RICK HALL: Well, I was certainly proud of the fact
###393 that I felt like a teacher of a bunch of guys
###396 that were making it.
###399 And I was dumb enough not to know that they were to almost
###403 put me out of business.
###405 DAVID HOOD: The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section were the rhythm
###408 section at Fame before we left and started Muscle Shoals
###412 Sound Studios.
###413 And so when we left, Rick was a little pissed off at us for
###416 leaving him.
###418 But he went right ahead and cut hit records without us.
###422 RICK HALL: They was so good at what they had done, and they
###424 had learned so well that they were kicking my ass.
###429 DAVID HOOD: When Rick started having his success as a
###432 result, me, guys I work with, all of the sudden people
###435 thought that we were experts almost.
###439 And so you think, well, maybe I am.
###441 DONNIE FRITZ: Well, just one thing led to another.
###443 And it just build up to what it became.
###447 But it was those early days of young people learning as we
###453 went along, you know.
###454 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###459 JAMIE BARRIER: The Fame, like, Ben Tanner
###461 used to work in there.
###462 And he let us come in at night.
###464 And we wrote songs and we had killer microphones.
###467 It recorded it perfect.
###469 If I go to my brother's house, this real sassy record player,
###472 you can, like, hear the earth being ripped apart, you know?
###475 It's was just, like, I thought it was awesome.
###478 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###481 JAMIE BARRIER: Florence, Alabama is so--
###483 it's such a corpse.
###484 It's real easy to kick it.
###486 Here it's a wasteland of abandoned massive buildings.
###490 The potential, if you want to do it, is, like, unlimited.
###493 It's just a matter of, well, I'd rather sit
###496 on the couch tonight.
###497 And, like, watch television or getting up and
###500 doing it, you know.
###501 That's like your main battle.
###503 It's hard to make a living off of art anywhere in any town--
###507 anywhere.
###507 I worked at Subway for seven years.
###510 I'm, like, I put this many hours into this job and do it
###513 for myself I can make ends meet.
###518 Yeah, this is the Black Owl Trading Company
###520 in Florence, Alabama.
###521 I mean, we record bands.
###523 We have touring bands.
###524 And we do screen printing in there.
###526 And that's the printing wheel.
###528 And this is our old heat machine.
###531 I listen to reggae records all day long and screen print.
###535 It's pretty cool.
###536 It's been good.
###536 We used to get a lot of harassment from the police.
###538 But we quit having a lot of the high school bands play,
###543 which sucks.
###544 But most of those bands were, like, hardcore or metal.
###548 Like, we weren't into the music.
###551 But we would do it just to, like, just to give them the
###554 place to play.
###556 The way I learned to do music is like the DC discord style.
###562 Putting out your own record, record it yourself for cheap,
###566 put out a zine, load up the van.
###570 I absolutely love that.
###572 You know what I mean?
###573 If that's what making it is, that's what I want.
###576 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###597 DOC DAILEY: And there's a lot of the older guys that'll tell
###599 you a lot of good stories.
###600 That's for sure.
###600 But I think the industry has just changed so much that
###603 right now it's the wild west as far as I can tell.
###606 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###613 JD MCCORKLE: In Florence there's not really, like, a
###616 music venue.
###617 There's bars and they have, like, a PA system set up.
###620 A big hold back is a law called 49/51.
###624 You can't have more revenue coming in from alcohol than
###626 you do food.
###627 It has to be in a 49-51% ratio.
###630 JAMIE BARRIER: I'm like the only guy that, I don't care
###632 about that law.
###633 All you got to do is clear furniture out of the room.
###635 You know what I'm saying?
###637 The lousiest nights I ever have are in bars anyway.
###639 That's just me.
###640 The best times I have are, like, in those weird kind of
###643 shows in the laundry room.
###646 IAN SVENONIUS: So yeah, what's it like being in a group here?
###649 DOC DAILEY: Travel a lot if you want to
###651 really play, you know.
###654 It's not your ideal place.
###655 You know, bands try to tour through here and we can't find
###658 shows for them.
###659 And people are really beating down the door to come
###661 through here now.
###662 But you just can't fill the place on a Monday night or
###665 Tuesday night.
###666 People would rather go and watch someone cover a song by
###670 a guy that might be playing down the street,
###673 you know, the original.
###675 IAN SVENONIUS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
###675 Yeah.
###676 DAVID HOOD: We play on a Wednesday night, which in the
###679 South, that's church night.
###680 I'm wondered sometimes if Elvis Presley couldn't show up
###683 and draw five people or something.
###685 It's just the people.
###687 It's not a really big scene around here like it is in a
###691 larger city.
###692 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###699 DOC DAILEY: Everybody growing up around here, their parents
###701 know some session guys.
###703 And everybody grew up with guitar in
###704 their house and pianos.
###705 It's hard to find someone down here that
###707 doesn't play a guitar.
###708 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###711 IAN SVENONIUS: I think of the Muscle Shoals thing as kind of
###713 this meeting point of all these songs.
###716 DAVID HOOD: I think so, too.
###717 And I think it was the players, and engineers, and
###722 people that created that sound probably more
###724 than anything else.
###725 SCOTT BOYER: The heart and soul that the people around
###727 here play with has always been my favorite thing about music
###731 from the Shoals, you know.
###733 DONNIE FRITZ: How this can happen in a little bitty town
###736 in North Alabama, you know.
###738 SCOTT BOYER: Yeah.
###738 I don't know whether to call it magic or not, but there's
###740 been something going on here that
###743 doesn't go on other places.
###746 RICK HALL: The main thing is, it's all about music.
###749 And it all starts with a song.
###751 And we can't forget that.
###752 
###758 [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
###759 MALE SPEAKER: One, two, three, four.
###761 [MUSIC PLAYING]
