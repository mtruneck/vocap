0:0:4,942 --> 0:0:6,4
GARY A. HAUGEN:
Well, I didn't plan


3
0:0:6,4 --> 0:0:8,43
to come to Google to get
razzed about my hair,


4
0:0:8,43 --> 0:0:10,79
but I guess you just
don't know what to expect.


5
0:0:10,79 --> 0:0:13,3
So thanks for keeping
me on my toes, Justin.


6
0:0:13,3 --> 0:0:15,39
Thank you all for
joining me today.


7
0:0:15,39 --> 0:0:17,88
It's a great privilege
to get to be here.


8
0:0:17,88 --> 0:0:20,18
I would like to share a
little bit about the problems


9
0:0:20,18 --> 0:0:21,87
of violence in the
developing world,


10
0:0:21,87 --> 0:0:24,81
but I like to start with
a story from Oregon,


11
0:0:24,81 --> 0:0:25,84
the State of Oregon.


12
0:0:25,84 --> 0:0:27,34
And maybe some of
you are joining us


13
0:0:27,34 --> 0:0:31,169
from Northern
California might relate.


14
0:0:31,169 --> 0:0:33,21
So there's this young
woman just a few months ago


15
0:0:33,21 --> 0:0:35,76
who's home alone in her house.


16
0:0:35,76 --> 0:0:39,59
She lives in a rural area,
and just a few months before,


17
0:0:39,59 --> 0:0:42,66
actually, she had been
horrifically assaulted


18
0:0:42,66 --> 0:0:44,53
by this guy.


19
0:0:44,53 --> 0:0:48,16
And this guy is now at
her house, actually.


20
0:0:48,16 --> 0:0:49,56
It's a weekend night.


21
0:0:49,56 --> 0:0:51,54
She's alone, it's
dark, and this guy's


22
0:0:51,54 --> 0:0:54,272
actually tearing his
way into her house.


23
0:0:54,272 --> 0:0:55,73
And she does what
anyone else would


24
0:0:55,73 --> 0:0:59,3
do, she picks up to the
phone to call 911, right?


25
0:0:59,3 --> 0:1:1,9
And then what
proceeds to happen is


26
0:1:1,9 --> 0:1:7,55
the 911 operator engages this
very, very tense conversation


27
0:1:7,55 --> 0:1:10,35
where she explains to this
young woman that I'm sorry,


28
0:1:10,35 --> 0:1:13,67
but because of budget
cuts in your area,


29
0:1:13,67 --> 0:1:17,39
you don't have law
enforcement in your area.


30
0:1:17,39 --> 0:1:21,65
That there's no one that
we can send for you.


31
0:1:21,65 --> 0:1:24,13
Law enforcement was
available on the weekdays,


32
0:1:24,13 --> 0:1:26,6
but this was the weekend.


33
0:1:26,6 --> 0:1:28,27
And there's this
incredibly painful


34
0:1:28,27 --> 0:1:32,64
10 minutes of conversation
where this 911 operator realized


35
0:1:32,64 --> 0:1:36,1
there's just nothing that
she can do for this woman.


36
0:1:36,1 --> 0:1:39,44
And horrifically,
of course, the man


37
0:1:39,44 --> 0:1:42,44
did make his way into the house,
horrifically assaults her,


38
0:1:42,44 --> 0:1:43,97
and rapes her.


39
0:1:43,97 --> 0:1:47,12
And this story did sort of
make the news around the world,


40
0:1:47,12 --> 0:1:48,925
and the reason I
share it, though,


41
0:1:48,925 --> 0:1:53,34
is because this is an
example of what billions


42
0:1:53,34 --> 0:1:58,4
of poor people in the world
live in as their daily reality.


43
0:1:58,4 --> 0:1:59,36
Why is that?


44
0:1:59,36 --> 0:2:2,93
Because they don't have law
enforcement in their area.


45
0:2:2,93 --> 0:2:6,79
A recent UN study found that
about four billion people


46
0:2:6,79 --> 0:2:11,16
in the world live outside
the protection of law.


47
0:2:11,16 --> 0:2:13,44
And one of things we're
trying to do in this book,


48
0:2:13,44 --> 0:2:16,63
"The Locust Effect" is first of
all, get the news of this out.


49
0:2:16,63 --> 0:2:18,53
And then have us pause
together to think


50
0:2:18,53 --> 0:2:19,65
about that for a moment.


51
0:2:19,65 --> 0:2:22,36
What if billions, especially
of the poorest people


52
0:2:22,36 --> 0:2:26,64
in the world, don't have access
to basic law enforcement?


53
0:2:26,64 --> 0:2:27,886
What does that look like?


54
0:2:27,886 --> 0:2:29,26
Well, we know a
bit what it feels


55
0:2:29,26 --> 0:2:30,968
like because of this
story of this woman.


56
0:2:30,968 --> 0:2:33,31
But it looks like something
different in Bolivia,


57
0:2:33,31 --> 0:2:37,32
for instance, where according
to statistics, if you sexually


58
0:2:37,32 --> 0:2:40,5
assault a child in
Bolivia, you actually


59
0:2:40,5 --> 0:2:43,15
are at greater risk of
slipping in the shower


60
0:2:43,15 --> 0:2:45,41
and dying than you are of
actually being convicted


61
0:2:45,41 --> 0:2:46,83
for that crime.


62
0:2:46,83 --> 0:2:49,86
And as a result, there just
an epidemic of sexual violence


63
0:2:49,86 --> 0:2:52,3
against women and
girls in Bolivia.


64
0:2:52,3 --> 0:2:56,21
In India, amazingly,
if you enslave someone


65
0:2:56,21 --> 0:2:59,24
you have a greater chance
of being struck by lightning


66
0:2:59,24 --> 0:3:2,87
than ever being actually
convicted for that crime.


67
0:3:2,87 --> 0:3:5,92
So this is what it looks like
in the developing world when


68
0:3:5,92 --> 0:3:9,616
you have this complete
collapse of law enforcement.


69
0:3:9,616 --> 0:3:11,49
And then what "The Locust
Effect" tries to do


70
0:3:11,49 --> 0:3:13,91
is then tell the
story of the violence


71
0:3:13,91 --> 0:3:17,31
that this collapse has unleashed
for the poorest in the world.


72
0:3:17,31 --> 0:3:21,0
And we go to four categories
of violence against the poor.


73
0:3:21,0 --> 0:3:23,19
The first one is what
we call gender violence.


74
0:3:23,19 --> 0:3:25,5
It's just sexual violence
and domestic abuse


75
0:3:25,5 --> 0:3:27,13
against women and girls.


76
0:3:27,13 --> 0:3:29,83
Which according to the
World Health Organization,


77
0:3:29,83 --> 0:3:32,78
it accounts for more death
and disability in the world


78
0:3:32,78 --> 0:3:37,13
than malaria, cancer,
car accidents, and war


79
0:3:37,13 --> 0:3:39,8
all combined.


80
0:3:39,8 --> 0:3:42,16
The greatest threat for
the average poor person


81
0:3:42,16 --> 0:3:44,97
in the developing world,
especially a woman or a girl


82
0:3:44,97 --> 0:3:47,99
is violence close at
home, sexual violence,


83
0:3:47,99 --> 0:3:50,3
or domestic abuse.


84
0:3:50,3 --> 0:3:52,66
I got to know a good
deal about this working


85
0:3:52,66 --> 0:3:55,6
with International
Justice Mission which,


86
0:3:55,6 --> 0:3:58,12
by the way, so grateful
for Google's partnership


87
0:3:58,12 --> 0:4:2,51
in this work trying to protect
the poorest from violence.


88
0:4:2,51 --> 0:4:6,47
And what we do is we have teams
in the developing world who


89
0:4:6,47 --> 0:4:9,48
are local indigenous
nationals, and they


90
0:4:9,48 --> 0:4:11,49
are lawyers, and
criminal investigators,


91
0:4:11,49 --> 0:4:14,62
and social workers and they take
on these cases of violent abuse


92
0:4:14,62 --> 0:4:17,329
and oppression on
behalf of the victims


93
0:4:17,329 --> 0:4:18,94
and seek justice for them.


94
0:4:18,94 --> 0:4:21,2
Make sure the perpetrators
are brought to justice,


95
0:4:21,2 --> 0:4:23,31
and make sure that we
provide long-term care


96
0:4:23,31 --> 0:4:25,62
for the survivors of this abuse.


97
0:4:25,62 --> 0:4:28,3
And so now we've been doing
this for almost 20 years,


98
0:4:28,3 --> 0:4:31,772
we've had 10s of thousands of
cases of this violent abuse.


99
0:4:31,772 --> 0:4:33,48
And it's getting to
know those cases that


100
0:4:33,48 --> 0:4:35,3
allows us to see the reality.


101
0:4:35,3 --> 0:4:40,3
And it came on for me meeting
this woman, Lucilla in Peru.


102
0:4:40,3 --> 0:4:44,6
Lucilla's a common
Andean mom who's


103
0:4:44,6 --> 0:4:45,84
trying to provide for
her little family.


104
0:4:45,84 --> 0:4:47,56
And as I got to know
her, I came to know


105
0:4:47,56 --> 0:4:49,74
the story of living
in her little town,


106
0:4:49,74 --> 0:4:52,12
she experienced the
horrific rape and murder


107
0:4:52,12 --> 0:4:53,96
of her eight-year-old
girl who was just


108
0:4:53,96 --> 0:4:55,13
dumped out on the street.


109
0:4:55,13 --> 0:4:57,706
They didn't even have
the-- I don't know.


110
0:4:57,706 --> 0:4:59,734
They didn't even
bother with the shame


111
0:4:59,734 --> 0:5:1,65
of like throwing her in
the river or anything.


112
0:5:1,65 --> 0:5:3,65
They just left her
out on the street.


113
0:5:3,65 --> 0:5:7,17
And to follow Lucilla
on the journey


114
0:5:7,17 --> 0:5:9,7
to see what it means
to try to get justice


115
0:5:9,7 --> 0:5:13,89
for such a crime when you have
no functioning law enforcement.


116
0:5:13,89 --> 0:5:16,18
One of things I found out
about Lucilla's little town


117
0:5:16,18 --> 0:5:18,31
in the Andean mountains
is that it actually


118
0:5:18,31 --> 0:5:22,16
had a higher rate of sexual
assault against women and girls


119
0:5:22,16 --> 0:5:25,92
than what was coming out of the
worst war zones of the Congo.


120
0:5:25,92 --> 0:5:27,5
And this was also
the idea that there


121
0:5:27,5 --> 0:5:29,77
can be levels of
violence taking place


122
0:5:29,77 --> 0:5:33,63
that maybe in the headlines
we hear about it when it's


123
0:5:33,63 --> 0:5:35,93
in a war, or a
conflict, or a genocide,


124
0:5:35,93 --> 0:5:39,82
but we're talking in this
book about everyday violence.


125
0:5:39,82 --> 0:5:42,83
The second category of everyday
violence that afflicts the poor


126
0:5:42,83 --> 0:5:45,28
is straight up slavery.


127
0:5:45,28 --> 0:5:48,94
The global slavery index
just came out in October,


128
0:5:48,94 --> 0:5:52,44
and it affirmed that there's
about 30 million people


129
0:5:52,44 --> 0:5:54,8
in the world who are
literally held in slavery.


130
0:5:54,8 --> 0:5:57,32
That's more people in slavery
than at any other time


131
0:5:57,32 --> 0:5:58,53
in human history.


132
0:5:58,53 --> 0:6:1,5
About 11 million people
were extracted from Africa


133
0:6:1,5 --> 0:6:4,21
during 400 years of the
transatlantic slave trade.


134
0:6:4,21 --> 0:6:8,54
But today, there's about
30 million held in slavery.


135
0:6:8,54 --> 0:6:12,58
In the book, you get the
sort of up close view of this


136
0:6:12,58 --> 0:6:16,41
from getting to know Mariama
and the story of her family


137
0:6:16,41 --> 0:6:18,9
and a number of
other villagers who


138
0:6:18,9 --> 0:6:20,63
were held as slaves
in a brick factory.


139
0:6:20,63 --> 0:6:24,21
And this is not in some
completely remote lawless


140
0:6:24,21 --> 0:6:25,4
part of India either.


141
0:6:25,4 --> 0:6:30,9
This is really just on the
beltway outside Bangalore,


142
0:6:30,9 --> 0:6:32,4
which is as you know
the high-tech capital


143
0:6:32,4 --> 0:6:33,67
in many ways of India.


144
0:6:33,67 --> 0:6:36,19
But it would just take
us a matter of minutes


145
0:6:36,19 --> 0:6:38,82
before we could be able to
drive with investigators to be


146
0:6:38,82 --> 0:6:41,91
able to find places
of literal slavery.


147
0:6:41,91 --> 0:6:46,77
So that's the second category
of violence is slavery.


148
0:6:46,77 --> 0:6:51,98
Third is the reality of police
abuse in the lives of the poor.


149
0:6:51,98 --> 0:6:54,7
The World Bank did
this global study


150
0:6:54,7 --> 0:6:57,519
which revealed that, it
said, police and courts


151
0:6:57,519 --> 0:6:59,6
in the developing
world actually make


152
0:6:59,6 --> 0:7:3,82
poor people less
secure and poorer.


153
0:7:3,82 --> 0:7:6,37
What you find is that poor
people in the developing world


154
0:7:6,37 --> 0:7:8,89
don't run to the police for
protection and to be safe.


155
0:7:8,89 --> 0:7:12,59
They run from the police
to be protected and safe.


156
0:7:12,59 --> 0:7:15,71
Statistics will also
show that the police are


157
0:7:15,71 --> 0:7:18,55
likely to actually steal more
from a common poor person


158
0:7:18,55 --> 0:7:20,89
than anybody else in
their community just


159
0:7:20,89 --> 0:7:23,98
from the daily grind of
extortion and bribery.


160
0:7:23,98 --> 0:7:26,15
So that's the fourth
category of violence.


161
0:7:26,15 --> 0:7:26,9
I mean, the third.


162
0:7:26,9 --> 0:7:29,87
The fourth is
violent land seizure,


163
0:7:29,87 --> 0:7:32,89
the way that millions of
poor people every year


164
0:7:32,89 --> 0:7:34,38
are threatened with having
their land stolen from them.


165
0:7:34,38 --> 0:7:38,86
In fact, about 5 million a
year find themselves forcibly


166
0:7:38,86 --> 0:7:40,78
thrown off their land.


167
0:7:40,78 --> 0:7:43,43
One of the largest categories
of victims of land theft


168
0:7:43,43 --> 0:7:44,45
are widows.


169
0:7:44,45 --> 0:7:48,6
Widows like, Susan, who is
one our clients in Uganda.


170
0:7:48,6 --> 0:7:50,22
And one of the things
we don't realize


171
0:7:50,22 --> 0:7:52,67
is that widows in
the developing world


172
0:7:52,67 --> 0:7:56,71
support about a half
a billion orphans.


173
0:7:56,71 --> 0:7:59,379
And so if you throw that family
off their little plot of land


174
0:7:59,379 --> 0:8:0,92
where they have
their little shelter,


175
0:8:0,92 --> 0:8:2,42
and their little
garden, and they're


176
0:8:2,42 --> 0:8:4,55
trying to sort of make
their way out of poverty,


177
0:8:4,55 --> 0:8:8,78
you have just decimated
their capacity to go forward.


178
0:8:8,78 --> 0:8:10,58
All of this I
emphasize is what we're


179
0:8:10,58 --> 0:8:13,31
calling everyday violence.


180
0:8:13,31 --> 0:8:15,28
Because many times when we
see or hear about violence,


181
0:8:15,28 --> 0:8:18,4
it's the stuff that
makes the headlines,


182
0:8:18,4 --> 0:8:20,23
the big wars, the genocide.


183
0:8:20,23 --> 0:8:23,49
I know something about
the phenomena of genocide.


184
0:8:23,49 --> 0:8:29,1
I was the Director of the UN's
genocide in Rwanda in 1994.


185
0:8:29,1 --> 0:8:33,0
And my job was to sort through
about 100 different mass graves


186
0:8:33,0 --> 0:8:35,39
and massacre sites to see
what it looks like when


187
0:8:35,39 --> 0:8:39,19
human beings just unleash
violence against one another.


188
0:8:39,19 --> 0:8:40,82
And the things that
you notice when


189
0:8:40,82 --> 0:8:42,57
you're digging
through all of that,


190
0:8:42,57 --> 0:8:44,28
and you trying to
picture what's it


191
0:8:44,28 --> 0:8:46,69
like in the moment of
genocide to be in that place,


192
0:8:46,69 --> 0:8:49,367
you realize that that person
in the moment of terror


193
0:8:49,367 --> 0:8:51,45
is really not crying out
for someone to bring them


194
0:8:51,45 --> 0:8:55,26
food, or a doctor, or a
teacher, or a microloan, right?


195
0:8:55,26 --> 0:8:57,1
They're crying out for
someone to restrain


196
0:8:57,1 --> 0:8:58,76
the hand of the
machete that's coming


197
0:8:58,76 --> 0:9:0,74
towards them and their family.


198
0:9:0,74 --> 0:9:3,68
And this is what
we are identifying


199
0:9:3,68 --> 0:9:5,96
in terms of our
engagement with the poor.


200
0:9:5,96 --> 0:9:8,41
We know a great deal about
providing food, and medicine,


201
0:9:8,41 --> 0:9:10,61
and education, and
other basic needs,


202
0:9:10,61 --> 0:9:13,374
but what about the violence?


203
0:9:13,374 --> 0:9:15,54
And so this is an effort
through "The Locust Effect"


204
0:9:15,54 --> 0:9:18,699
to begin to open our
eyes to this epidemic.


205
0:9:18,699 --> 0:9:20,24
We're calling it
"The Locust Effect."


206
0:9:20,24 --> 0:9:22,41
It comes from these
stories from history


207
0:9:22,41 --> 0:9:23,88
that are very
powerful when you've


208
0:9:23,88 --> 0:9:26,51
got these poor farmers who
were sort of starting to scrape


209
0:9:26,51 --> 0:9:30,24
their way out of poverty, and
all of their work and ambition


210
0:9:30,24 --> 0:9:32,7
is in their crops, right?


211
0:9:32,7 --> 0:9:35,4
And they see them growing
and they offer great promise.


212
0:9:35,4 --> 0:9:37,71
And then one day, the
locust just descend.


213
0:9:37,71 --> 0:9:39,31
And honestly, in
a matter of hours,


214
0:9:39,31 --> 0:9:42,65
they will just wipe
out years of work.


215
0:9:42,65 --> 0:9:45,55
And this is the way violence
operates in the developing


216
0:9:45,55 --> 0:9:49,57
world for the poor who are
trying to get out of poverty.


217
0:9:49,57 --> 0:9:53,43
The violent predators just
come through and take it away.


218
0:9:53,43 --> 0:9:57,13
And so this means there are
tremendous implications for all


219
0:9:57,13 --> 0:9:58,98
of us who care about
global poverty.


220
0:9:58,98 --> 0:10:1,17
Probably all of us in
our lifetime in some way


221
0:10:1,17 --> 0:10:2,85
have been engaged with
that struggle, right?


222
0:10:2,85 --> 0:10:4,52
We've given some money.


223
0:10:4,52 --> 0:10:6,15
We've sought fresh water.


224
0:10:6,15 --> 0:10:7,52
We've sponsored a child.


225
0:10:7,52 --> 0:10:9,31
We've helped with
a school somewhere.


226
0:10:9,31 --> 0:10:11,75
We sponsored a microloan.


227
0:10:11,75 --> 0:10:15,8
And so all of these are
extremely important efforts,


228
0:10:15,8 --> 0:10:18,32
and we've seen a lot
of significant progress


229
0:10:18,32 --> 0:10:21,4
over the last 30 years
in addressing poverty.


230
0:10:21,4 --> 0:10:22,42
But what we're
starting to see now


231
0:10:22,42 --> 0:10:24,21
is we may be reaching
the limit of what


232
0:10:24,21 --> 0:10:27,4
can be done if we
don't begin to address


233
0:10:27,4 --> 0:10:30,42
the locust of violence who
can come in and just sweep


234
0:10:30,42 --> 0:10:32,58
the benefits of all
that effort away.


235
0:10:32,58 --> 0:10:34,98
The thing you'll notice
about the locust as well,


236
0:10:34,98 --> 0:10:37,49
is that not only do the
locust descend and destroy


237
0:10:37,49 --> 0:10:40,83
the fruit of the
farmer, but the farmer


238
0:10:40,83 --> 0:10:43,29
is not going to stop the locust.


239
0:10:43,29 --> 0:10:43,79
Right?


240
0:10:43,79 --> 0:10:47,83
We have to actually start
to do something differently.


241
0:10:47,83 --> 0:10:50,8
And so that's what "The
Locust Effect" is trying to do


242
0:10:50,8 --> 0:10:52,43
is to begin to change the
conversation about poverty


243
0:10:52,43 --> 0:10:54,34
to make sure that
we're mainstreaming


244
0:10:54,34 --> 0:10:56,4
the problem of violence.


245
0:10:56,4 --> 0:10:59,349
Because if that's
off the radar screen,


246
0:10:59,349 --> 0:11:1,14
we're going to miss
out on something that's


247
0:11:1,14 --> 0:11:3,89
undermining all
of our good work.


248
0:11:3,89 --> 0:11:4,88
One of the things that
the book tries to do


249
0:11:4,88 --> 0:11:8,5
is to try to say, well, why
is law enforcement so broken


250
0:11:8,5 --> 0:11:9,36
in the developing world?


251
0:11:9,36 --> 0:11:11,97
Why is there such
a lawless chaos


252
0:11:11,97 --> 0:11:14,25
for the average poor person?


253
0:11:14,25 --> 0:11:16,647
The book brings forth
really three surprises,


254
0:11:16,647 --> 0:11:18,48
and then one thing
that's not so surprising.


255
0:11:18,48 --> 0:11:20,53
The first surprise
is to realize, oh,


256
0:11:20,53 --> 0:11:22,78
all of these law enforcement
systems in the developing


257
0:11:22,78 --> 0:11:26,564
world, they were never
designed to stop crime.


258
0:11:26,564 --> 0:11:28,98
They were never designed to
protect the common poor person


259
0:11:28,98 --> 0:11:29,85
from violence.


260
0:11:29,85 --> 0:11:33,69
They were set up by colonial
powers over the first stage


261
0:11:33,69 --> 0:11:36,31
of the 20th century in order
to protect the government


262
0:11:36,31 --> 0:11:38,17
from the common people.


263
0:11:38,17 --> 0:11:41,29
And they've never been
re-engineered to actually


264
0:11:41,29 --> 0:11:42,31
enforce the law.


265
0:11:42,31 --> 0:11:44,81
And as a result, poor people
in the developing world


266
0:11:44,81 --> 0:11:46,6
now have great laws.


267
0:11:46,6 --> 0:11:48,43
This tremendous human rights
revolution over the last 50


268
0:11:48,43 --> 0:11:52,6
years has embedded great
laws in these countries.


269
0:11:52,6 --> 0:11:53,99
But what they don't
have is law enforcement.


270
0:11:53,99 --> 0:11:56,75
And it turns out that
that really matters.


271
0:11:56,75 --> 0:11:57,7
And mostly because
they've been saddled


272
0:11:57,7 --> 0:11:59,616
with these colonial
systems of law enforcement


273
0:11:59,616 --> 0:12:1,47
that have never
been re-engineered.


274
0:12:1,47 --> 0:12:3,5
The second reason
you find out is


275
0:12:3,5 --> 0:12:6,38
that there's been a massive
privatization of security


276
0:12:6,38 --> 0:12:7,88
in the developing world.


277
0:12:7,88 --> 0:12:10,642
So if you've been traveling in
the developing world at all,


278
0:12:10,642 --> 0:12:13,1
you'll sort of maybe notice,
especially in your first visit


279
0:12:13,1 --> 0:12:14,3
there, like almost
everywhere I go


280
0:12:14,3 --> 0:12:15,675
somebody's got a
gun guarding us.


281
0:12:15,675 --> 0:12:19,37
I mean, he's at the
restaurant, at the hotel,


282
0:12:19,37 --> 0:12:22,34
they're at the whatever sort
of commercial enterprise.


283
0:12:22,34 --> 0:12:26,409
There are just people
providing physical protection


284
0:12:26,409 --> 0:12:26,95
all the time.


285
0:12:26,95 --> 0:12:29,23
I was at the World
Economic Forum at Davos


286
0:12:29,23 --> 0:12:32,99
a few years ago with a
number of corporate leaders


287
0:12:32,99 --> 0:12:35,46
who have massive investments
in the developing


288
0:12:35,46 --> 0:12:39,176
world, huge
facilities, thousands


289
0:12:39,176 --> 0:12:40,3
and thousands of employees.


290
0:12:40,3 --> 0:12:42,75
And I just asked with all this
violence in the developing


291
0:12:42,75 --> 0:12:45,65
world that we're aware of,
like how do you guys protect


292
0:12:45,65 --> 0:12:47,34
your people and your property?


293
0:12:47,34 --> 0:12:48,7
And they all kind of
look at each other,


294
0:12:48,7 --> 0:12:51,5
and they actually almost
answer in unison to say,


295
0:12:51,5 --> 0:12:53,36
we pay for it.


296
0:12:53,36 --> 0:12:55,29
But if you think
about this, it's


297
0:12:55,29 --> 0:12:58,14
one thing if those with
wealth and influence


298
0:12:58,14 --> 0:13:2,4
leave the public school and the
public school kind of gets bad.


299
0:13:2,4 --> 0:13:5,105
Or you leave the public
transportation system,


300
0:13:5,105 --> 0:13:6,674
and the buses
become not so great.


301
0:13:6,674 --> 0:13:8,84
But what happens when the
people of wealth and power


302
0:13:8,84 --> 0:13:11,7
abandon the public
justice system?


303
0:13:11,7 --> 0:13:13,6
When the basic law
enforcement system


304
0:13:13,6 --> 0:13:16,42
is allowed to get worse,
and worse, and worse?


305
0:13:16,42 --> 0:13:18,3
That is the reality in
the developing world.


306
0:13:18,3 --> 0:13:19,82
And part of the
reason it stayed off


307
0:13:19,82 --> 0:13:23,12
the radar screen of
everybody is that the sector


308
0:13:23,12 --> 0:13:27,56
of wealthy folks in the
developing world from whom


309
0:13:27,56 --> 0:13:30,49
the economic growth
is coming from,


310
0:13:30,49 --> 0:13:32,0
have been able to
secure themselves


311
0:13:32,0 --> 0:13:33,61
with private security.


312
0:13:33,61 --> 0:13:36,11
And so now, in the aggregate,
if you look at that country,


313
0:13:36,11 --> 0:13:38,15
it produces a decent
rate of economic growth.


314
0:13:38,15 --> 0:13:42,6
But for people who are living
off, let's say, $2 a day,


315
0:13:42,6 --> 0:13:45,21
that's about more
than 2 billion people,


316
0:13:45,21 --> 0:13:48,0
those folks can afford to
be safe and so they're not.


317
0:13:48,0 --> 0:13:52,0



318
0:13:52,0 --> 0:13:53,62
The third other
surprising reason


319
0:13:53,62 --> 0:13:55,62
behind sort of the
brokenness of law enforcement


320
0:13:55,62 --> 0:13:58,51
is it's just not been the
subject of our investment.


321
0:13:58,51 --> 0:14:1,8
We've poured trillions of
dollars over the last 50 years


322
0:14:1,8 --> 0:14:4,69
into food systems, water
systems, public health systems,


323
0:14:4,69 --> 0:14:7,39
all totally vital, and
actually we haven't necessarily


324
0:14:7,39 --> 0:14:9,66
spent enough on trying
to engage those systems,


325
0:14:9,66 --> 0:14:12,69
because the poor need
all of those things.


326
0:14:12,69 --> 0:14:17,65
But we can't find even 1% of
all that expenditure and effort


327
0:14:17,65 --> 0:14:21,4
over the last 50 years that has
gone to building public justice


328
0:14:21,4 --> 0:14:23,64
systems that will actually
protect the poor from violence.


329
0:14:23,64 --> 0:14:26,19
So the third surprise is to
say, oh, we haven't actually


330
0:14:26,19 --> 0:14:29,42
really tried all that hard
to address this problem yet.


331
0:14:29,42 --> 0:14:32,68
The fourth explanation is
less surprising, perhaps,


332
0:14:32,68 --> 0:14:34,81
and that's just
the idea that there


333
0:14:34,81 --> 0:14:37,69
are people in power in
the developing world who


334
0:14:37,69 --> 0:14:40,32
have figured out how to
succeed in the absence


335
0:14:40,32 --> 0:14:41,86
of public justice, right?


336
0:14:41,86 --> 0:14:44,47
And so they now actually
would feel quite threatened


337
0:14:44,47 --> 0:14:48,18
if justice systems actually
started working in the way


338
0:14:48,18 --> 0:14:49,67
that they should.


339
0:14:49,67 --> 0:14:51,529
So that's the
diagnosis that we're


340
0:14:51,529 --> 0:14:53,32
trying to make here in
"The Locust Effect,"


341
0:14:53,32 --> 0:14:55,89
but then we try to make
a turn towards hope.


342
0:14:55,89 --> 0:14:57,84
And that is to
ask, OK great, this


343
0:14:57,84 --> 0:15:1,97
is totally depressing,
massive violence, grotesque.


344
0:15:1,97 --> 0:15:4,22
There's no way I'm
going to read this book.


345
0:15:4,22 --> 0:15:5,82
I'm depressed already.


346
0:15:5,82 --> 0:15:7,32
My wife is like,
yeah, give me a gin


347
0:15:7,32 --> 0:15:8,694
and tonic the next
time I'm going


348
0:15:8,694 --> 0:15:11,15
to try to read one
of your books, Gary.


349
0:15:11,15 --> 0:15:13,25
So yeah, the bad news is true.


350
0:15:13,25 --> 0:15:15,86
But this is part of where the
good news comes from, right?


351
0:15:15,86 --> 0:15:17,71
Because if you
think about the era


352
0:15:17,71 --> 0:15:19,57
when the AIDS
epidemic was really


353
0:15:19,57 --> 0:15:21,29
beginning to catch
momentum in the world,


354
0:15:21,29 --> 0:15:24,62
it required everybody to
open their eyes to something


355
0:15:24,62 --> 0:15:26,91
that was still a little
beneath the surface,


356
0:15:26,91 --> 0:15:29,36
but if unaddressed was
going to roll over just


357
0:15:29,36 --> 0:15:30,43
about everything else.


358
0:15:30,43 --> 0:15:32,9
And that's where we
are when it comes


359
0:15:32,9 --> 0:15:34,95
to the phenomenon of violence
in the developing world.


360
0:15:34,95 --> 0:15:39,38
So yes, we've got to wake up
to what is the tough reality.


361
0:15:39,38 --> 0:15:41,65
But the hope can be found
in a number of areas.


362
0:15:41,65 --> 0:15:44,6
The first is just in history.


363
0:15:44,6 --> 0:15:48,12
The truth is all of us enjoy
reasonably functioning justice


364
0:15:48,12 --> 0:15:52,8
systems here in New York, or you
can be in the San Francisco Bay


365
0:15:52,8 --> 0:15:55,19
Area, or Chicago, or you're
around the world in Paris


366
0:15:55,19 --> 0:15:57,92
or Tokyo, or various places
around the world that


367
0:15:57,92 --> 0:16:0,71
have the more developed
and affluent economies.


368
0:16:0,71 --> 0:16:3,25
And in each one of
those cities, you


369
0:16:3,25 --> 0:16:7,57
will find a history where 100
years ago, 150 years ago, you


370
0:16:7,57 --> 0:16:9,58
would have had the exact
same levels of just


371
0:16:9,58 --> 0:16:12,96
horrific violence and
horrific police corruption


372
0:16:12,96 --> 0:16:14,2
and brutality.


373
0:16:14,2 --> 0:16:16,22
In the book, we give
actually a series


374
0:16:16,22 --> 0:16:19,62
of descriptions to ask you,
like, guess which city this is?


375
0:16:19,62 --> 0:16:22,16
And you think your reading
from some just nightmare


376
0:16:22,16 --> 0:16:23,97
of a city in the
developing world,


377
0:16:23,97 --> 0:16:26,83
but actually it's one of
the cities that we live in.


378
0:16:26,83 --> 0:16:29,5
And you can see,
oh, every country


379
0:16:29,5 --> 0:16:32,56
begins with a difficult
situation of lawless violence,


380
0:16:32,56 --> 0:16:36,95
and you need to build systems
to protect the common citizenry.


381
0:16:36,95 --> 0:16:39,38
So what is the
process by which you


382
0:16:39,38 --> 0:16:42,91
move to law enforcement
that actually


383
0:16:42,91 --> 0:16:44,46
protects the common person?


384
0:16:44,46 --> 0:16:47,525
And you learn that this is
actually quite a doable thing.


385
0:16:47,525 --> 0:16:49,15
So you learn these
lessons from history


386
0:16:49,15 --> 0:16:52,28
and some clues about what might
happen in the developing world,


387
0:16:52,28 --> 0:16:54,37
but also some very
specific projects


388
0:16:54,37 --> 0:16:58,28
that we have highlighted in
the book where the success is


389
0:16:58,28 --> 0:17:1,67
really very encouraging
that if you focus on helping


390
0:17:1,67 --> 0:17:4,97
law enforcement do its job,
it has a dramatic result.


391
0:17:4,97 --> 0:17:9,359
One of those projects we did
in the second largest city


392
0:17:9,359 --> 0:17:12,65
of the Philippines
called Cebu which


393
0:17:12,65 --> 0:17:16,76
had a horrible problem
of child sex trafficking.


394
0:17:16,76 --> 0:17:20,77
The abduction and taking
of these young minor girls


395
0:17:20,77 --> 0:17:22,74
into the commercial
sex industry,


396
0:17:22,74 --> 0:17:25,609
and it's just a business
of rape for profit.


397
0:17:25,609 --> 0:17:29,83
And this was just taking
place at a horrific level


398
0:17:29,83 --> 0:17:31,47
in the city of Cebu.


399
0:17:31,47 --> 0:17:33,98
And we got some funding
from the Gates Foundation


400
0:17:33,98 --> 0:17:35,2
to try and experiment.


401
0:17:35,2 --> 0:17:37,4
Let's see whether or not it's
possible to do two things.


402
0:17:37,4 --> 0:17:39,48
Number one, let's see if
we can actually stand up


403
0:17:39,48 --> 0:17:42,49
local law enforcement,
which when we first


404
0:17:42,49 --> 0:17:45,5
began the project in the
city, it was actually


405
0:17:45,5 --> 0:17:47,87
on almost on the side of
sex trafficking, right?


406
0:17:47,87 --> 0:17:50,17
They're actually protecting
this and receiving funding


407
0:17:50,17 --> 0:17:52,38
for doing so.


408
0:17:52,38 --> 0:17:54,94
And by the way, the people
who carried out this project


409
0:17:54,94 --> 0:17:57,62
were our local
Filipino staff, right?


410
0:17:57,62 --> 0:18:0,364
Local Filipino lawyers,
Filipino criminal investigators,


411
0:18:0,364 --> 0:18:2,78
and social workers, and they
were trying to do two things.


412
0:18:2,78 --> 0:18:4,87
One, can we stand up that
local law enforcement


413
0:18:4,87 --> 0:18:7,475
through training and
programs of empowerment


414
0:18:7,475 --> 0:18:8,85
that allow them
to actually begin


415
0:18:8,85 --> 0:18:11,31
to send sex traffickers to jail?


416
0:18:11,31 --> 0:18:13,9
And if we do that,
will it actually


417
0:18:13,9 --> 0:18:15,6
then lower the amount
of sex trafficking


418
0:18:15,6 --> 0:18:16,877
of kids in the city?


419
0:18:16,877 --> 0:18:19,21
So we had some outside auditors
come in at the beginning


420
0:18:19,21 --> 0:18:21,41
and measure, well, how
much victimization of kids


421
0:18:21,41 --> 0:18:24,93
is there in the sex trade
before the project even begins.


422
0:18:24,93 --> 0:18:26,68
And then let's measure
it four years later


423
0:18:26,68 --> 0:18:28,66
to see what the impact is.


424
0:18:28,66 --> 0:18:31,83
So four years training
law enforcement,


425
0:18:31,83 --> 0:18:35,55
setting up specialized
units, fast tracking courts,


426
0:18:35,55 --> 0:18:37,74
providing good social
services to the victim,


427
0:18:37,74 --> 0:18:40,95
so they could actually make
their way through the justice


428
0:18:40,95 --> 0:18:42,58
system and receive healing.


429
0:18:42,58 --> 0:18:45,12
So after rescuing
hundreds of those victims


430
0:18:45,12 --> 0:18:48,45
and then sending about hundred
of the traffickers to jail,


431
0:18:48,45 --> 0:18:52,2
what was the outcome
after four years?


432
0:18:52,2 --> 0:18:53,82
The goal of the
project was to try


433
0:18:53,82 --> 0:18:57,91
to achieve a 20% reduction
in the victimization of kids


434
0:18:57,91 --> 0:18:59,28
in the commercial sex trade.


435
0:18:59,28 --> 0:19:2,3
But after four years, the
auditors came back and measured


436
0:19:2,3 --> 0:19:6,68
and they found a 79% reduction
in the victimization of kids


437
0:19:6,68 --> 0:19:8,38
in the commercial sex trade.


438
0:19:8,38 --> 0:19:12,82
And what you find is that
those who brutalize the poor,


439
0:19:12,82 --> 0:19:16,21
and children especially,
are not brave people.


440
0:19:16,21 --> 0:19:18,29
They're doing it
because they can.


441
0:19:18,29 --> 0:19:20,36
And once they start
getting in trouble for it,


442
0:19:20,36 --> 0:19:23,13
they start to leave the
children and the kids alone.


443
0:19:23,13 --> 0:19:25,58
So this is sort of the reality
that we're helping people


444
0:19:25,58 --> 0:19:27,41
to recover through the book.


445
0:19:27,41 --> 0:19:30,0
That, yes, there's a real
serious problem in the world,


446
0:19:30,0 --> 0:19:34,43
but there's really
hopeful possibilities


447
0:19:34,43 --> 0:19:36,56
for making a difference.


448
0:19:36,56 --> 0:19:41,3
I would, of course, say that
the real purpose of this book


449
0:19:41,3 --> 0:19:43,91
is to begin to change the
conversation about poverty,


450
0:19:43,91 --> 0:19:44,65
right?


451
0:19:44,65 --> 0:19:46,114
Because if you
enter a discussion


452
0:19:46,114 --> 0:19:47,53
about global
poverty, if you think


453
0:19:47,53 --> 0:19:49,55
of the phenomenon
of yourself, you


454
0:19:49,55 --> 0:19:51,37
think of, OK, food and hunger.


455
0:19:51,37 --> 0:19:52,12
You think of medical care.


456
0:19:52,12 --> 0:19:53,4
You think of shacks.


457
0:19:53,4 --> 0:19:55,11
You think of bad
sanitation, bad education,


458
0:19:55,11 --> 0:19:57,11
the need for microloans,
all that sort of thing.


459
0:19:57,11 --> 0:19:59,53
But what does not
generally come to our mind


460
0:19:59,53 --> 0:20:2,97
is the violence that the poor
are chronically vulnerable to.


461
0:20:2,97 --> 0:20:4,92
And we just want to
change that conversation


462
0:20:4,92 --> 0:20:6,94
to make sure we're
asking the question, what


463
0:20:6,94 --> 0:20:8,64
about the violence?


464
0:20:8,64 --> 0:20:11,66
So we would like you to be
a part of that for sure.


465
0:20:11,66 --> 0:20:14,77
We'd love for you to buy
the book, first of all.


466
0:20:14,77 --> 0:20:17,24
Educate yourself, share
it with other people.


467
0:20:17,24 --> 0:20:19,71
If you buy the book
this week, we actually


468
0:20:19,71 --> 0:20:22,23
have some donors that
are going to match


469
0:20:22,23 --> 0:20:25,1
that with a $20 contribution
towards the actual work


470
0:20:25,1 --> 0:20:30,24
in the field of trying to defend
those who are victims of abuse.


471
0:20:30,24 --> 0:20:31,52
We'll have a copy here.


472
0:20:31,52 --> 0:20:33,535
And Victor Boutros
who's my co-author,


473
0:20:33,535 --> 0:20:35,1
I always want to recognize him.


474
0:20:35,1 --> 0:20:36,35
Victor Boutros.


475
0:20:36,35 --> 0:20:38,66
We're happy to sign
those, and that


476
0:20:38,66 --> 0:20:41,844
will add $0.4 to the value
of the book or something.


477
0:20:41,844 --> 0:20:44,59



478
0:20:44,59 --> 0:20:48,86
So we would love for you to
buy the book and to share that.


479
0:20:48,86 --> 0:20:50,44
The second thing
we'd like to do is


480
0:20:50,44 --> 0:20:52,89
actually, have you look
at a piece of video


481
0:20:52,89 --> 0:20:57,319
that we've put together to
likewise share on social media.


482
0:20:57,319 --> 0:20:59,11
Because obviously,
we've written this book,


483
0:20:59,11 --> 0:21:0,87
it's got 40 pages of footnotes.


484
0:21:0,87 --> 0:21:3,55
It really takes you into sort
of the deep intellectual case


485
0:21:3,55 --> 0:21:4,666
about what's going on.


486
0:21:4,666 --> 0:21:6,4
But for most of
us, in many ways,


487
0:21:6,4 --> 0:21:10,7
it's important just for us
to get a heart level almost


488
0:21:10,7 --> 0:21:12,93
sense of what this
challenge is looking


489
0:21:12,93 --> 0:21:15,84
like for the common person,
and also what the promise is.


490
0:21:15,84 --> 0:21:17,74
So if you've got two
minutes, let's have


491
0:21:17,74 --> 0:21:20,8
a look at this
video, and then talk


492
0:21:20,8 --> 0:21:22,589
about one more thing
we can do together.


493
0:21:22,589 --> 0:21:25,84
[VIDEO PLAYING]


494
0:21:25,84 --> 0:24:26,53



495
0:24:26,53 --> 0:24:28,7
So that's the second
thing we'd love you to do,


496
0:24:28,7 --> 0:24:30,42
just help get the
conversation going


497
0:24:30,42 --> 0:24:32,75
by sharing that piece of video.


498
0:24:32,75 --> 0:24:37,396
The third thing, is that right
now at the United Nations,


499
0:24:37,396 --> 0:24:39,27
there's a tremendously
important conversation


500
0:24:39,27 --> 0:24:42,91
taking place related to the
Millennium Development Goals.


501
0:24:42,91 --> 0:24:45,94
In the year 2000, the
international community


502
0:24:45,94 --> 0:24:48,506
came together to build sort
of the definitive roadmap


503
0:24:48,506 --> 0:24:51,13
for addressing poverty, and they
set out these eight Millennium


504
0:24:51,13 --> 0:24:52,241
Development Goals.


505
0:24:52,241 --> 0:24:54,49
And they've been pursuing
them over the last 15 years,


506
0:24:54,49 --> 0:24:57,27
and have seen some really
significant progress


507
0:24:57,27 --> 0:24:58,884
on those targeted things.


508
0:24:58,884 --> 0:25:1,5
The big problem that people
are starting to realize,


509
0:25:1,5 --> 0:25:4,44
though, is that they spoke
of the massive solution


510
0:25:4,44 --> 0:25:6,86
to try to deal with
poverty, and they did not


511
0:25:6,86 --> 0:25:9,13
say a word about violence.


512
0:25:9,13 --> 0:25:13,69
And now, imagine you're trying
to move the world forward out


513
0:25:13,69 --> 0:25:15,41
of poverty, but you're
not doing anything


514
0:25:15,41 --> 0:25:17,48
about this violence
that is just ripping


515
0:25:17,48 --> 0:25:20,33
the rug out from underneath
everyone's ability


516
0:25:20,33 --> 0:25:21,28
to move forward.


517
0:25:21,28 --> 0:25:23,35
So we have a petition that
we're putting together


518
0:25:23,35 --> 0:25:26,26
and there's a way to sign
on there that will just


519
0:25:26,26 --> 0:25:29,61
be going to the UN team that
is starting to put together


520
0:25:29,61 --> 0:25:32,43
the Millennium Development Goals
to say, hey, let's just make


521
0:25:32,43 --> 0:25:35,45
sure that this conversation
includes addressing


522
0:25:35,45 --> 0:25:38,74
the violence that is descending
like locusts upon the poor


523
0:25:38,74 --> 0:25:40,26
in developing world.


524
0:25:40,26 --> 0:25:43,93
This is, again, from the
AIDS epidemic perspective,


525
0:25:43,93 --> 0:25:45,87
it wasn't just the
public health experts.


526
0:25:45,87 --> 0:25:50,21
It wasn't just the sort
of global affairs experts


527
0:25:50,21 --> 0:25:52,33
that rang the alarm
about the problem,


528
0:25:52,33 --> 0:25:54,5
and said, no, this is
something we need to address.


529
0:25:54,5 --> 0:25:56,93
It was very, very
common people who


530
0:25:56,93 --> 0:26:0,39
began to think differently
about the problems in the world


531
0:26:0,39 --> 0:26:2,89
and to make sure that we were
addressing this epidemic as


532
0:26:2,89 --> 0:26:3,49
well.


533
0:26:3,49 --> 0:26:5,365
And I think it's an
opportunity for all of us


534
0:26:5,365 --> 0:26:7,26
to raise our voice
on behalf of those


535
0:26:7,26 --> 0:26:9,31
who are victims of
violence as well.


536
0:26:9,31 --> 0:26:10,78
So thank you very much
for the opportunity


537
0:26:10,78 --> 0:26:13,95
to let me drone on here a bit,
but I would love to-- I've


538
0:26:13,95 --> 0:26:15,95
been trying to guess about
what, if any of this,


539
0:26:15,95 --> 0:26:17,2
might be interesting to you.


540
0:26:17,2 --> 0:26:18,91
But it, actually, might
be better to ask you.


541
0:26:18,91 --> 0:26:21,16
So what questions do you have?


542
0:26:21,16 --> 0:26:24,6
How might we engage the
conversation together?


543
0:26:24,6 --> 0:26:27,865
And I understand from Justin,
unlike his prior advertisements


544
0:26:27,865 --> 0:26:29,6
to me, I don't
actually get to be


545
0:26:29,6 --> 0:26:31,81
able to hear from
the folks remotely.


546
0:26:31,81 --> 0:26:34,7
So you guys carry all
the burden of asking


547
0:26:34,7 --> 0:26:35,54
the engaging and good questions.


548
0:26:35,54 --> 0:26:37,912
So here you go.


549
0:26:37,912 --> 0:26:39,12
What are thoughts, questions?


550
0:26:39,12 --> 0:26:39,62
Yes.


551
0:26:39,62 --> 0:26:42,8



552
0:26:42,8 --> 0:26:45,63
AUDIENCE: The question
is two for one.


553
0:26:45,63 --> 0:26:47,96
When you collected help like
[INAUDIBLE] and everything


554
0:26:47,96 --> 0:26:52,72
you mentioned, do we expect--
does that decrease violence


555
0:26:52,72 --> 0:26:55,2
in those countries
that [INAUDIBLE]


556
0:26:55,2 --> 0:26:56,76
and by which factor?


557
0:26:56,76 --> 0:26:58,58
And two.


558
0:26:58,58 --> 0:27:0,6
This experiment that
you did in the city


559
0:27:0,6 --> 0:27:4,365
with the sex trafficking,
how much did it cost and can


560
0:27:4,365 --> 0:27:9,37
you put a price
[INAUDIBLE] on this program


561
0:27:9,37 --> 0:27:12,886
compared to if you had given
meals, and food, and whatever,


562
0:27:12,886 --> 0:27:15,2
what the benefits are.


563
0:27:15,2 --> 0:27:17,61
GARY A. HAUGEN:
Yeah, great question.


564
0:27:17,61 --> 0:27:21,91
Sort of going at the first one,
I mean, the second one first.


565
0:27:21,91 --> 0:27:26,97
The data on the actual
cost of law enforcement


566
0:27:26,97 --> 0:27:28,67
is available to us.


567
0:27:28,67 --> 0:27:30,58
It'll give you an idea
of what it would cost.


568
0:27:30,58 --> 0:27:36,35
The data is not very good about
how much the economic benefit


569
0:27:36,35 --> 0:27:37,95
is from all of that.


570
0:27:37,95 --> 0:27:40,105
And so it's just being
very much developed.


571
0:27:40,105 --> 0:27:42,37
But what you can
see, for instance,


572
0:27:42,37 --> 0:27:44,84
is that where the
studies have been done,


573
0:27:44,84 --> 0:27:50,65
the GDP is reduced
somewhere between 2% and 7%


574
0:27:50,65 --> 0:27:54,29
an entire nation by criminal
violence and violence


575
0:27:54,29 --> 0:27:55,339
in the community.


576
0:27:55,339 --> 0:27:57,88
You will see, in they did some
studies in Latin America where


577
0:27:57,88 --> 0:28:2,43
they showed half of the
accumulated net social capital


578
0:28:2,43 --> 0:28:7,6
was eliminated, half of it
over a 15-year period of time


579
0:28:7,6 --> 0:28:8,29
because of violence.


580
0:28:8,29 --> 0:28:10,8
They're starting
to begin to develop


581
0:28:10,8 --> 0:28:12,53
the numerical costs of violence.


582
0:28:12,53 --> 0:28:16,2
It costs for instance in what
they call Disability Adjusted


583
0:28:16,2 --> 0:28:21,82
Life Years, about 9 million
Disability Adjusted life years


584
0:28:21,82 --> 0:28:25,15
are wasted because of violence
against women and girls.


585
0:28:25,15 --> 0:28:28,6
And so that's massive
amounts of productivity.


586
0:28:28,6 --> 0:28:34,3
What you also know is that the
economies that are actually


587
0:28:34,3 --> 0:28:37,21
producing social mobility
are the ones that


588
0:28:37,21 --> 0:28:40,935
provide protection for
those who are poorest.


589
0:28:40,935 --> 0:28:42,56
Because in the absence
of that, they're


590
0:28:42,56 --> 0:28:45,392
unable to keep even the
benefits of their effort.


591
0:28:45,392 --> 0:28:47,6
Some of this is hard to see,
though, because in, as I


592
0:28:47,6 --> 0:28:50,545
explained a little bit, in
low income and middle income


593
0:28:50,545 --> 0:28:51,92
countries right
now, you actually


594
0:28:51,92 --> 0:28:57,94
see some significant rates of
economic growth, reasonable GDP


595
0:28:57,94 --> 0:28:58,6
advancements.


596
0:28:58,6 --> 0:29:1,93
But what you see when you
look at it, and disaggregate


597
0:29:1,93 --> 0:29:3,91
it is that that
economic growth is


598
0:29:3,91 --> 0:29:6,85
coming from the sector
of the country that


599
0:29:6,85 --> 0:29:9,96
has protected itself
with private security.


600
0:29:9,96 --> 0:29:13,17
And that's a massive
expense, by the way, that


601
0:29:13,17 --> 0:29:15,84
could be poured into a public
security, but at the moment


602
0:29:15,84 --> 0:29:18,78
is just privatizing part of it.


603
0:29:18,78 --> 0:29:22,38
One of things that the book does
is call for much greater study


604
0:29:22,38 --> 0:29:24,14
of how much would this cost?


605
0:29:24,14 --> 0:29:25,86
What would the benefit be?


606
0:29:25,86 --> 0:29:28,7
But there certainly is now
enough data from the World Bank


607
0:29:28,7 --> 0:29:31,99
and from other multilateral
institutions that


608
0:29:31,99 --> 0:29:35,66
suggest that what is lost
to violence is massive.


609
0:29:35,66 --> 0:29:39,15
And that if we don't get out in
front of it, that kind of cost


610
0:29:39,15 --> 0:29:40,86
is just going to grow.


611
0:29:40,86 --> 0:29:42,43
Yeah.


612
0:29:42,43 --> 0:29:43,93
Other questions?


613
0:29:43,93 --> 0:29:46,1
Thank you.


614
0:29:46,1 --> 0:29:48,13
AUDIENCE: So the
first question was


615
0:29:48,13 --> 0:29:51,44
people are looking at is from
an economic modeling standpoint.


616
0:29:51,44 --> 0:29:54,6
Are people looking at it
also from a public health


617
0:29:54,6 --> 0:29:55,78
standpoint?


618
0:29:55,78 --> 0:29:57,602
Because the models
might be different.


619
0:29:57,602 --> 0:30:2,76
And the other question was,
I'm curious about the-- I mean,


620
0:30:2,76 --> 0:30:6,26
solving this at the macro
level seems very hard, right?


621
0:30:6,26 --> 0:30:10,1
Because you have civil societies
that may not have traditions,


622
0:30:10,1 --> 0:30:14,5
and they differ radically.


623
0:30:14,5 --> 0:30:17,36
So I'd like you to talk
a little bit about that.


624
0:30:17,36 --> 0:30:17,867
Perfect.


625
0:30:17,867 --> 0:30:18,95
GARY A. HAUGEN: Thank you.


626
0:30:18,95 --> 0:30:24,31
Yeah, certainly this has, over
just maybe the last 15 years,


627
0:30:24,31 --> 0:30:28,14
been looked at now as an
epidemiological matter


628
0:30:28,14 --> 0:30:29,42
from the public health sector.


629
0:30:29,42 --> 0:30:32,21
In fact, the World Health
Organization, it was about 10,


630
0:30:32,21 --> 0:30:35,19
15 years ago now, did
this massive global study


631
0:30:35,19 --> 0:30:37,5
about violence as
a health problem.


632
0:30:37,5 --> 0:30:41,53
And that's where much
of the data for the book


633
0:30:41,53 --> 0:30:43,84
is now coming from is the
World Health Organization


634
0:30:43,84 --> 0:30:45,85
and public health
experts are dialed


635
0:30:45,85 --> 0:30:51,27
into sort of the implications,
the ripple effects, of violence


636
0:30:51,27 --> 0:30:52,77
in the lives of poor people.


637
0:30:52,77 --> 0:30:55,3
What public health
has no experience in,


638
0:30:55,3 --> 0:30:58,4
however, is how you
stop the violence.


639
0:30:58,4 --> 0:31:0,77
And what is then
unfortunate is that world


640
0:31:0,77 --> 0:31:6,35
of law enforcement that actually
reduces violent behavior is


641
0:31:6,35 --> 0:31:9,189
sort of then off in its
own silo and public health


642
0:31:9,189 --> 0:31:10,23
has been off in its silo.


643
0:31:10,23 --> 0:31:11,67
And what we're
encouraging now is


644
0:31:11,67 --> 0:31:13,94
that those things come together.


645
0:31:13,94 --> 0:31:20,78
There's been some work done
on the economics of violence


646
0:31:20,78 --> 0:31:24,53
and the way that
undermines economic growth.


647
0:31:24,53 --> 0:31:27,31
But most of that's been
done in developed countries.


648
0:31:27,31 --> 0:31:30,56
So obviously, the data's
easier and more available,


649
0:31:30,56 --> 0:31:32,81
and it's a little
too bad the way


650
0:31:32,81 --> 0:31:35,5
our study tends to
run to the places


651
0:31:35,5 --> 0:31:37,74
where the examination of
the problem is easiest.


652
0:31:37,74 --> 0:31:39,49
That makes sense in a
certain kind of way,


653
0:31:39,49 --> 0:31:41,419
but we do need to bring
a lot of those lenses


654
0:31:41,419 --> 0:31:43,46
now into the developing
world to fully appreciate


655
0:31:43,46 --> 0:31:44,99
what's happening.


656
0:31:44,99 --> 0:31:49,634
The other question
is absolutely the one


657
0:31:49,634 --> 0:31:51,3
to be answered, which
is, wow, this just


658
0:31:51,3 --> 0:31:55,39
sounds like this massive generic
problem that actually is very


659
0:31:55,39 --> 0:32:0,49
localized in its manifestations,
and probably in its solutions,


660
0:32:0,49 --> 0:32:3,38
how do we begin to address it?


661
0:32:3,38 --> 0:32:5,45
One of our suggestions
in the book


662
0:32:5,45 --> 0:32:8,31
is precisely that what is
needed are some small scale


663
0:32:8,31 --> 0:32:12,24
experiments in some focused
places in the world.


664
0:32:12,24 --> 0:32:15,11
It's true, for instance, that
penicillin works everywhere


665
0:32:15,11 --> 0:32:15,74
in the world.


666
0:32:15,74 --> 0:32:16,8
And there are
certain ways in which


667
0:32:16,8 --> 0:32:18,174
law enforcement
works everywhere.


668
0:32:18,174 --> 0:32:20,94
As to say, in almost
every context,


669
0:32:20,94 --> 0:32:24,99
if human beings face a
cost for doing a behavior,


670
0:32:24,99 --> 0:32:28,2
they are reduced in their
likelihood of doing it.


671
0:32:28,2 --> 0:32:32,85
That's just true the same way
that penicillin just works.


672
0:32:32,85 --> 0:32:36,21
But what it takes in a
given society and culture


673
0:32:36,21 --> 0:32:38,24
for law enforcement
to be effective


674
0:32:38,24 --> 0:32:41,48
and to be supported
by the community,


675
0:32:41,48 --> 0:32:43,2
that's a different
equation everywhere.


676
0:32:43,2 --> 0:32:44,95
So we're interested
in supporting,


677
0:32:44,95 --> 0:32:47,22
and actually are
pursuing now, we


678
0:32:47,22 --> 0:32:50,19
have seven different
projects around the world,


679
0:32:50,19 --> 0:32:52,109
like the Cebu one,
which says, OK,


680
0:32:52,109 --> 0:32:53,9
not everywhere and in
regard to everything,


681
0:32:53,9 --> 0:32:55,97
but let's start in
a few laboratories


682
0:32:55,97 --> 0:32:57,36
and begin to experiment.


683
0:32:57,36 --> 0:33:0,82
What does it take in order
to do one thing first,


684
0:33:0,82 --> 0:33:3,4
stand up local law enforcement?


685
0:33:3,4 --> 0:33:6,81
Have the police, and the courts,
and the public justice system


686
0:33:6,81 --> 0:33:8,68
actually switch sides.


687
0:33:8,68 --> 0:33:10,495
So that instead of
preying upon the poor,


688
0:33:10,495 --> 0:33:12,44
they're actually
protecting the poor.


689
0:33:12,44 --> 0:33:14,524
And we've actually learned
quite a bit about that.


690
0:33:14,524 --> 0:33:16,19
And there's some
things you see that are


691
0:33:16,19 --> 0:33:17,49
common in most communities.


692
0:33:17,49 --> 0:33:19,75
And there's other things
that are very particular.


693
0:33:19,75 --> 0:33:21,42
And so what there
needs to be is just


694
0:33:21,42 --> 0:33:23,92
a much more robust
experimentation


695
0:33:23,92 --> 0:33:25,38
of this in the world.


696
0:33:25,38 --> 0:33:28,45
Because again, it's not going
to come from a silver bullet


697
0:33:28,45 --> 0:33:29,89
one size fits all.


698
0:33:29,89 --> 0:33:32,81
We did here in America, so
it's going to work over here.


699
0:33:32,81 --> 0:33:36,13
It's going to be a customized,
tailor-made, and community


700
0:33:36,13 --> 0:33:41,27
owned struggle in order to
bring justice for the poor.


701
0:33:41,27 --> 0:33:45,38
But that's when we need to start
to bring resources and effort


702
0:33:45,38 --> 0:33:48,96
to that's commensurate to
the size of the problem.


703
0:33:48,96 --> 0:33:50,36
Thank you.


704
0:33:50,36 --> 0:33:52,865
Other questions?


705
0:33:52,865 --> 0:33:53,49
Please, Justin.


706
0:33:53,49 --> 0:33:56,982



707
0:33:56,982 --> 0:33:58,69
AUDIENCE: So being
that we are at Google,


708
0:33:58,69 --> 0:34:1,9
I'm curious as to what your
thoughts are on the role


709
0:34:1,9 --> 0:34:3,5
that technology
can play in being


710
0:34:3,5 --> 0:34:5,13
a constructive element
of these changes.


711
0:34:5,13 --> 0:34:6,86
GARY A. HAUGEN: Yeah,
well, one of things


712
0:34:6,86 --> 0:34:8,75
I'm hoping technology
will do is just sort


713
0:34:8,75 --> 0:34:12,3
of shrink the world in
terms of awareness, right?


714
0:34:12,3 --> 0:34:15,0
Because one of the things that's
difficult in this era is we


715
0:34:15,0 --> 0:34:17,55
can live on different
planetary systems, right?


716
0:34:17,55 --> 0:34:21,62
I mean, the idea that there are
millions of people in slavery.


717
0:34:21,62 --> 0:34:25,61
The idea that sexual assault
can take place at such a level


718
0:34:25,61 --> 0:34:28,469
that you're more likely
to fall in the shower


719
0:34:28,469 --> 0:34:30,69
than to ever go to jail for it.


720
0:34:30,69 --> 0:34:33,4
Those can feel so far from us.


721
0:34:33,4 --> 0:34:36,579
And one of the things
that this era has done


722
0:34:36,579 --> 0:34:38,12
is shrink that world
so that everyone


723
0:34:38,12 --> 0:34:39,78
can be much more aware of this.


724
0:34:39,78 --> 0:34:43,179
One of things that we're
also starting to bring


725
0:34:43,179 --> 0:34:44,8
is visualization of this.


726
0:34:44,8 --> 0:34:47,719
I mean, our teams now do
undercover investigations


727
0:34:47,719 --> 0:34:50,59
that expose these kinds of
abuses that are taking place.


728
0:34:50,59 --> 0:34:53,52
And that stuff can now
almost be shared real time


729
0:34:53,52 --> 0:34:53,76
around the world.


730
0:34:53,76 --> 0:34:55,239
It's going to be
harder and harder


731
0:34:55,239 --> 0:34:58,52
to get away with this stuff.


732
0:34:58,52 --> 0:35:0,36
But once we have
exposure, then we


733
0:35:0,36 --> 0:35:4,43
need to move actually
towards solutions.


734
0:35:4,43 --> 0:35:7,15
The other thing that technology
has a capacity to do,


735
0:35:7,15 --> 0:35:9,2
amazingly, is bring
accountability


736
0:35:9,2 --> 0:35:10,915
and transparency.


737
0:35:10,915 --> 0:35:13,4
You're starting to see this
in the corruption realm


738
0:35:13,4 --> 0:35:18,18
now where instead
of paying a police


739
0:35:18,18 --> 0:35:21,62
officer for your ticket on
the spot, you go to some kiosk


740
0:35:21,62 --> 0:35:23,37
somewhere electronically
and pay for that.


741
0:35:23,37 --> 0:35:25,661
So it isn't even the opportunity
for the police officer


742
0:35:25,661 --> 0:35:26,9
to take the money.


743
0:35:26,9 --> 0:35:31,277
Or to like be able to
go to register and say,


744
0:35:31,277 --> 0:35:33,61
yeah, there were supposed to
be police in our community,


745
0:35:33,61 --> 0:35:36,2
and if this is day 20 where
we've never seen anybody,


746
0:35:36,2 --> 0:35:41,1
and all that sort of data and
that picture starts to appear.


747
0:35:41,1 --> 0:35:47,39
So we're even exploring the ways
in which satellite imagery is


748
0:35:47,39 --> 0:35:51,36
able to actually see
where the brick kilns are


749
0:35:51,36 --> 0:35:55,53
in South Asia where there's
more likely to be slavery.


750
0:35:55,53 --> 0:35:59,44
And the tracking of
criminality, the new VP


751
0:35:59,44 --> 0:36:4,17
of investigations at IJM is
the former director of NCIS.


752
0:36:4,17 --> 0:36:7,39
And he's very interested in
trying to leverage technology


753
0:36:7,39 --> 0:36:9,91
in this crime fighting
effort around the world.


754
0:36:9,91 --> 0:36:12,66
So I'm not the one,
certainly, to be


755
0:36:12,66 --> 0:36:14,66
able to suggest what all
the possibilities are,


756
0:36:14,66 --> 0:36:17,25
but what I would love to
do is to see those who have


757
0:36:17,25 --> 0:36:19,67
this expertise and these
capacities just sort of join


758
0:36:19,67 --> 0:36:20,795
the struggle and the fight.


759
0:36:20,795 --> 0:36:23,392



760
0:36:23,392 --> 0:36:25,21
Yes sir.


761
0:36:25,21 --> 0:36:28,26
AUDIENCE: Just as an idea,
with the proliferation


762
0:36:28,26 --> 0:36:30,831
of cell phones
throughout the world.


763
0:36:30,831 --> 0:36:32,8
What about the self-reporting?


764
0:36:32,8 --> 0:36:33,27
GARY A. HAUGEN: Absolutely.


765
0:36:33,27 --> 0:36:35,2
Yeah, you do notice
that right now.


766
0:36:35,2 --> 0:36:37,42
There are very few
bad things that


767
0:36:37,42 --> 0:36:42,304
happen these days sort of in any
kind of public way, especially


768
0:36:42,304 --> 0:36:44,22
law enforcement and so
forth that there aren't


769
0:36:44,22 --> 0:36:47,29
five people around
with a cell phone.


770
0:36:47,29 --> 0:36:49,52
Challenge, of course, in
the poorest communities


771
0:36:49,52 --> 0:36:53,12
is the people living off $2 a
day have less access to that.


772
0:36:53,12 --> 0:36:55,47
And to be clear,
you can see why this


773
0:36:55,47 --> 0:36:57,67
is why crime runs to
those places, right?


774
0:36:57,67 --> 0:36:59,91
It runs to be amongst
the poor, because they're


775
0:36:59,91 --> 0:37:2,59
going to be the least empowered.


776
0:37:2,59 --> 0:37:4,5
One of things we
do, of course, is


777
0:37:4,5 --> 0:37:8,11
take that kind of technology
into those communities


778
0:37:8,11 --> 0:37:10,96
and into some of the darkest
places where crime is taking


779
0:37:10,96 --> 0:37:14,31
place, infiltrate it
with video technology,


780
0:37:14,31 --> 0:37:17,41
and now the world can see
and know what's going on.


781
0:37:17,41 --> 0:37:21,69
And that is, you have
to know, that when


782
0:37:21,69 --> 0:37:25,0
you think about violent
perpetrators of horrific crime,


783
0:37:25,0 --> 0:37:28,95
they just seem so intimidating,
and how could you ever


784
0:37:28,95 --> 0:37:30,33
go against them?


785
0:37:30,33 --> 0:37:33,46
One of the things you have to
understand about criminality


786
0:37:33,46 --> 0:37:37,91
and violence is that there's
a reason why they hide it,


787
0:37:37,91 --> 0:37:40,18
because they're afraid.


788
0:37:40,18 --> 0:37:41,64
You fundamentally
hide what you're


789
0:37:41,64 --> 0:37:44,87
doing, because you're afraid
that if somebody saw it,


790
0:37:44,87 --> 0:37:48,29
you would be in trouble, and
you couldn't get away with it.


791
0:37:48,29 --> 0:37:51,9
And as our world has the
technology increasingly


792
0:37:51,9 --> 0:37:56,75
for where the bullies cannot
do this without being seen,


793
0:37:56,75 --> 0:37:58,46
they're going to do it less.


794
0:37:58,46 --> 0:38:0,44
So there's significant promise.


795
0:38:0,44 --> 0:38:1,71
The question now I
think, substantially,


796
0:38:1,71 --> 0:38:3,115
is how to get those
tools increasingly


797
0:38:3,115 --> 0:38:4,698
in the hands of those
who are poorest.


798
0:38:4,698 --> 0:38:7,165



799
0:38:7,165 --> 0:38:9,72
Daniel, did you have a question?


800
0:38:9,72 --> 0:38:12,35
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you we're
talking about experiments.


801
0:38:12,35 --> 0:38:15,28
I know that there have been a
number of things on experiments


802
0:38:15,28 --> 0:38:20,0
in trying to [INAUDIBLE]
poverty like the team of MIT.


803
0:38:20,0 --> 0:38:21,34
Can we work with them?


804
0:38:21,34 --> 0:38:23,382
And can you describe some
of your other projects?


805
0:38:23,382 --> 0:38:24,881
GARY A. HAUGEN:
Yeah, no, we haven't


806
0:38:24,881 --> 0:38:26,86
had the opportunity of
the poverty lab at MIT


807
0:38:26,86 --> 0:38:29,7
that actually did a
really fantastic project


808
0:38:29,7 --> 0:38:33,55
with Indian police
to actually see


809
0:38:33,55 --> 0:38:35,94
what it would take for the
community to actually begin


810
0:38:35,94 --> 0:38:39,44
to have greater confidence
in working with the police.


811
0:38:39,44 --> 0:38:41,58
And it's like all
great resources,


812
0:38:41,58 --> 0:38:44,46
a set of things that are
confirmed by the data


813
0:38:44,46 --> 0:38:47,41
that, oh yeah, we really did
think that that would help.


814
0:38:47,41 --> 0:38:49,36
And then also turns
out, nope, everybody


815
0:38:49,36 --> 0:38:50,4
thought this would help.


816
0:38:50,4 --> 0:38:52,51
Doesn't help at all.


817
0:38:52,51 --> 0:38:54,86
So we would love to
have an opportunity


818
0:38:54,86 --> 0:38:57,5
to engage some of our work
with that kind of very


819
0:38:57,5 --> 0:39:0,422
careful sort of
measurement capacity.


820
0:39:0,422 --> 0:39:2,13
Because that's what's
it's going to take.


821
0:39:2,13 --> 0:39:4,24
It's going to be
sort of taking what


822
0:39:4,24 --> 0:39:7,49
we think we know about improving
these law enforcement systems,


823
0:39:7,49 --> 0:39:10,22
and then testing it, and
measuring, and seeing what


824
0:39:10,22 --> 0:39:13,1
actually does work and let's
put more resources on the things


825
0:39:13,1 --> 0:39:14,3
actually work.


826
0:39:14,3 --> 0:39:15,52
Yeah.


827
0:39:15,52 --> 0:39:17,46
AUDIENCE: So you
talked about violence


828
0:39:17,46 --> 0:39:18,995
as contributing
cause to poverty.


829
0:39:18,995 --> 0:39:19,87
GARY A. HAUGEN: Yeah.


830
0:39:19,87 --> 0:39:23,49
AUDIENCE: What about the
causes of the violence itself?


831
0:39:23,49 --> 0:39:27,27
How much of that is,
perhaps, need driven?


832
0:39:27,27 --> 0:39:27,86
GARY A. HAUGEN: Yes.


833
0:39:27,86 --> 0:39:28,901
AUDIENCE: Is it cultural?


834
0:39:28,901 --> 0:39:30,19
Is it innate?


835
0:39:30,19 --> 0:39:32,2
Does mankind just suck?


836
0:39:32,2 --> 0:39:35,94
A very small
percentage of people


837
0:39:35,94 --> 0:39:39,9
having a very large
impact on the community,


838
0:39:39,9 --> 0:39:42,7
or can you discuss
violence as an effect?


839
0:39:42,7 --> 0:39:45,186
GARY A. HAUGEN: I'd love to.


840
0:39:45,186 --> 0:39:46,56
I will tell you,
any of you who'd


841
0:39:46,56 --> 0:39:49,34
taken a genocide course
in college or something


842
0:39:49,34 --> 0:39:52,22
and look at genocide, I
mean, it's disturbing.


843
0:39:52,22 --> 0:39:55,34
The capacity for the
very common person


844
0:39:55,34 --> 0:39:57,79
to become very, very violent
in regard to their neighbors


845
0:39:57,79 --> 0:39:58,83
is amazing.


846
0:39:58,83 --> 0:40:2,23
And as the investigator
of the Rwanda genocide,


847
0:40:2,23 --> 0:40:6,95
the story is there that once
the restraints were taken off,


848
0:40:6,95 --> 0:40:9,35
and you could do
anything to your neighbor


849
0:40:9,35 --> 0:40:16,43
to take their land, to
sexually assault the neighbor's


850
0:40:16,43 --> 0:40:19,82
daughter, and to
kill your neighbor,


851
0:40:19,82 --> 0:40:24,99
this is unleashed with
quite frightening ferocity.


852
0:40:24,99 --> 0:40:28,56
So there is something
in human beings


853
0:40:28,56 --> 0:40:31,56
that just needs to
be accounted for.


854
0:40:31,56 --> 0:40:36,21
And we've seen in history, too,
that the way that most violence


855
0:40:36,21 --> 0:40:38,52
is restrained is
by law enforcement.


856
0:40:38,52 --> 0:40:40,54
That's why we all
have law enforcement.


857
0:40:40,54 --> 0:40:43,15
None of you are choosing to
live in a neighborhood that


858
0:40:43,15 --> 0:40:45,0
has no law enforcement.


859
0:40:45,0 --> 0:40:47,9
But it would be interesting,
and if I had a whiteboard here,


860
0:40:47,9 --> 0:40:50,83
you could draw a graph of crime.


861
0:40:50,83 --> 0:40:54,23
And on the left axis, you
would put different kinds


862
0:40:54,23 --> 0:40:58,0
of crime and their frequency.


863
0:40:58,0 --> 0:41:1,4
And then what you
do is draw a line


864
0:41:1,4 --> 0:41:4,934
on the horizontal axis of risk.


865
0:41:4,934 --> 0:41:6,35
And what you would
measure is sort


866
0:41:6,35 --> 0:41:10,77
of the elasticity of different
kinds of crime to risk.


867
0:41:10,77 --> 0:41:15,6
And at the top is what we
call crime of opportunity.


868
0:41:15,6 --> 0:41:17,55
You do it because you
can get away with it,


869
0:41:17,55 --> 0:41:19,22
and there's no risk at all.


870
0:41:19,22 --> 0:41:21,53
And so you do it
because you can.


871
0:41:21,53 --> 0:41:24,97
Then there's crime
of desperation.


872
0:41:24,97 --> 0:41:27,99
Maybe I'm poor, and I feel
like I got a break that window


873
0:41:27,99 --> 0:41:31,4
and steal that bread, because
I'm really quite desperate.


874
0:41:31,4 --> 0:41:32,85
Then there's crime of necessity.


875
0:41:32,85 --> 0:41:37,7
You feel like in order to hold
power, or in order to survive,


876
0:41:37,7 --> 0:41:38,85
you must commit this crime.


877
0:41:38,85 --> 0:41:42,37
And sometimes when the state
commits crime, like torture,


878
0:41:42,37 --> 0:41:44,9
they feel like they
have to do this, right?


879
0:41:44,9 --> 0:41:45,772
It's necessity.


880
0:41:45,772 --> 0:41:47,73
And then if you go way
down towards the bottom,


881
0:41:47,73 --> 0:41:49,56
you have social
pathology and deviancy.


882
0:41:49,56 --> 0:41:51,489
A person actually can't
even stop themselves


883
0:41:51,489 --> 0:41:53,28
from committing that
crime, because there's


884
0:41:53,28 --> 0:41:54,93
a sickness involved.


885
0:41:54,93 --> 0:41:59,4
All of those have different
elasticity to risk.


886
0:41:59,4 --> 0:42:5,6
So the pathology, man, somebody
who's really a social deviant,


887
0:42:5,6 --> 0:42:8,8
and you see this with
pedophilia and other-- there you


888
0:42:8,8 --> 0:42:11,24
can actually ratchet
up to risk level.


889
0:42:11,24 --> 0:42:13,55
And it drops maybe a little
bit, but that line actually


890
0:42:13,55 --> 0:42:15,934
stays pretty steady,
because in that they end up


891
0:42:15,934 --> 0:42:18,1
going to jail in many
respects if there's decent law


892
0:42:18,1 --> 0:42:19,1
enforcement.


893
0:42:19,1 --> 0:42:21,35
Then you have
crime of necessity,


894
0:42:21,35 --> 0:42:23,67
and likewise, it
takes a little dip,


895
0:42:23,67 --> 0:42:28,27
but then it stays
pretty steady, too.


896
0:42:28,27 --> 0:42:30,86
Desperation, yeah, it
takes a fall a little bit,


897
0:42:30,86 --> 0:42:34,7
but when desperation
feels like necessity,


898
0:42:34,7 --> 0:42:35,81
it also flattens out.


899
0:42:35,81 --> 0:42:38,15
But crime of
opportunity, amazing.


900
0:42:38,15 --> 0:42:39,99
That stuff goes out
a little bit by risk,


901
0:42:39,99 --> 0:42:43,716
and then it drops off to
zero, because it was crime


902
0:42:43,716 --> 0:42:45,9
because I could
get away with it.


903
0:42:45,9 --> 0:42:47,68
Now I can't get away with it,
I'm just not doing any more.


904
0:42:47,68 --> 0:42:51,6
The vast, vast, vast majority
of violence against the poor


905
0:42:51,6 --> 0:42:53,94
is crime of opportunity.


906
0:42:53,94 --> 0:42:58,187
And so we can with law
enforcement reduce that amount,


907
0:42:58,187 --> 0:43:0,27
and then we'll be wrestling
with the kind of crime


908
0:43:0,27 --> 0:43:4,31
that we're dealing with in our
more developed countries, which


909
0:43:4,31 --> 0:43:7,39
is the hard problems of
social deviancy and people


910
0:43:7,39 --> 0:43:9,97
who are desperate and have
no hope, all kinds of things


911
0:43:9,97 --> 0:43:14,45
involved here, substance abuse
and a whole set of factors


912
0:43:14,45 --> 0:43:16,62
But all this crime
of opportunity, this


913
0:43:16,62 --> 0:43:18,86
is where all the crime is
happening against the poor


914
0:43:18,86 --> 0:43:19,75
because they can.


915
0:43:19,75 --> 0:43:24,12
And that is a very,
very doable proposition.


916
0:43:24,12 --> 0:43:26,24
Long lecture on the
elasticity of crime


917
0:43:26,24 --> 0:43:29,48
than you weren't
expecting today.


918
0:43:29,48 --> 0:43:30,65
I apologize in advance.


919
0:43:30,65 --> 0:43:33,24



920
0:43:33,24 --> 0:43:34,64
Any other questions?


921
0:43:34,64 --> 0:43:35,235
Yes.


922
0:43:35,235 --> 0:43:37,375
AUDIENCE: What about the
real structural situation


923
0:43:37,375 --> 0:43:40,6
of just the police and underpay?


924
0:43:40,6 --> 0:43:43,29
And the fact that in many
countries being a cop


925
0:43:43,29 --> 0:43:44,416
is a license to steal.


926
0:43:44,416 --> 0:43:45,54
GARY A. HAUGEN: Absolutely.


927
0:43:45,54 --> 0:43:46,19
Yeah.


928
0:43:46,19 --> 0:43:48,1
So that has to be addressed.


929
0:43:48,1 --> 0:43:49,17
That's the bad news.


930
0:43:49,17 --> 0:43:51,41
The good news is it's
totally addressable.


931
0:43:51,41 --> 0:43:54,97
In other words, it's not
rocket science in a way.


932
0:43:54,97 --> 0:43:56,655
I worked the first
half of my career,


933
0:43:56,655 --> 0:43:59,3
and Victor currently is that
the US Department of Justice


934
0:43:59,3 --> 0:44:0,5
dealing with police corruption.


935
0:44:0,5 --> 0:44:1,16
So in every society,
you are going


936
0:44:1,16 --> 0:44:2,95
to have police corruption,
but it actually


937
0:44:2,95 --> 0:44:5,76
turns out there's things
that you can do about this.


938
0:44:5,76 --> 0:44:8,12
And one of the case studies
that we look at in the book


939
0:44:8,12 --> 0:44:11,74
is the study of the
country of Georgia,


940
0:44:11,74 --> 0:44:14,12
which is a former
Soviet Republic.


941
0:44:14,12 --> 0:44:16,83
And it was one of the most
corrupt countries in the world.


942
0:44:16,83 --> 0:44:19,68
In fact, in 2003,
Transparency International


943
0:44:19,68 --> 0:44:22,35
ranked it as like 143
out of a 190 countries


944
0:44:22,35 --> 0:44:23,675
in being the most corrupt.


945
0:44:23,675 --> 0:44:25,36
I mean, more corrupt
than any country


946
0:44:25,36 --> 0:44:26,61
that we currently work in.


947
0:44:26,61 --> 0:44:29,13
And we work in some
very corrupt countries.


948
0:44:29,13 --> 0:44:32,86
And yet there was a
political election,


949
0:44:32,86 --> 0:44:36,48
a party was committed
to a platform, really


950
0:44:36,48 --> 0:44:38,25
of anti-corruption
came into power.


951
0:44:38,25 --> 0:44:42,31
And they seriously went after
police corruption first.


952
0:44:42,31 --> 0:44:44,7
Just to give you an idea,
police corruption in Georgia,


953
0:44:44,7 --> 0:44:48,38
you would pay $10,000 to
the police commissioner


954
0:44:48,38 --> 0:44:50,9
in order to get hired as a
police officer for which you


955
0:44:50,9 --> 0:44:53,23
are paid $10.


956
0:44:53,23 --> 0:44:55,444
Why would you pay
$10,000 for a job that


957
0:44:55,444 --> 0:44:56,985
was only going to
pay to $10 a month?


958
0:44:56,985 --> 0:44:59,18
It's because you were
given a license really


959
0:44:59,18 --> 0:45:2,65
to use that authority
then to steal from people.


960
0:45:2,65 --> 0:45:4,65
And what happened as a
result, is the state just


961
0:45:4,65 --> 0:45:6,941
started producing more and
more police officers, right?


962
0:45:6,941 --> 0:45:8,0
Because I get this now.


963
0:45:8,0 --> 0:45:9,66
The more police officers
there are, the more money


964
0:45:9,66 --> 0:45:11,35
I make as the
commissioner of police.


965
0:45:11,35 --> 0:45:15,3



966
0:45:15,3 --> 0:45:19,82
As far as payment, let
me just address that.


967
0:45:19,82 --> 0:45:22,4
So what they did is they
came in very committed


968
0:45:22,4 --> 0:45:23,12
to addressing this.


969
0:45:23,12 --> 0:45:26,45
The thing they did is they
fired 16,000 police officers


970
0:45:26,45 --> 0:45:27,79
in a single day in the capital.


971
0:45:27,79 --> 0:45:29,45
Sent them all
home, and the place


972
0:45:29,45 --> 0:45:31,26
was safer and better for it.


973
0:45:31,26 --> 0:45:33,2
Right?


974
0:45:33,2 --> 0:45:35,17
Just sent them all
home and rebuilt


975
0:45:35,17 --> 0:45:37,559
the police from the ground up.


976
0:45:37,559 --> 0:45:39,1
One of the things
that they had to do


977
0:45:39,1 --> 0:45:42,852
was then pay the
police very well,


978
0:45:42,852 --> 0:45:44,56
because they want to
recruit good people,


979
0:45:44,56 --> 0:45:48,33
and equip them well,
and supply them well.


980
0:45:48,33 --> 0:45:53,1
And as a result a lot of this
committed effort, by 2010


981
0:45:53,1 --> 0:45:56,12
seven years later, the
Georgian police force


982
0:45:56,12 --> 0:45:59,1
was rated as less corrupt
than the US police,


983
0:45:59,1 --> 0:46:1,89
the German police,
or the French police.


984
0:46:1,89 --> 0:46:3,895
The World Bank wrote
up the study of this,


985
0:46:3,895 --> 0:46:6,39
and it's featured in the book.


986
0:46:6,39 --> 0:46:8,61
Because I actually
fortuitously sat next


987
0:46:8,61 --> 0:46:10,182
to the prime
minister of Georgia,


988
0:46:10,182 --> 0:46:11,64
because I was amazed
at this story.


989
0:46:11,64 --> 0:46:13,43
And I got a chance to talk
to him over dinner about it.


990
0:46:13,43 --> 0:46:15,513
And he said people say
that corruption is culture.


991
0:46:15,513 --> 0:46:18,26
He says, corruption is a choice.


992
0:46:18,26 --> 0:46:20,1
And when a society
makes the choice


993
0:46:20,1 --> 0:46:22,29
to begin to root this
out, it's possible.


994
0:46:22,29 --> 0:46:25,32
And the place to start
amazingly is the police,


995
0:46:25,32 --> 0:46:27,16
because it sounds
counterintuitive in a way,


996
0:46:27,16 --> 0:46:29,76
because that's like the
worst, scariest place.


997
0:46:29,76 --> 0:46:32,22
But if you think about
it, corruption is a crime.


998
0:46:32,22 --> 0:46:34,83
It's stealing from other people.


999
0:46:34,83 --> 0:46:38,76
And if you have crime of
corruption in the crime


1000
0:46:38,76 --> 0:46:42,28
fighting force, your capacity
to root it out from other places


1001
0:46:42,28 --> 0:46:43,88
is just about zero.


1002
0:46:43,88 --> 0:46:46,586
So we've kind of laughed
about it and joked about it.


1003
0:46:46,586 --> 0:46:48,71
Oh, the police are corrupt
in the developing world.


1004
0:46:48,71 --> 0:46:50,38
No, no, that's a
serious problem,


1005
0:46:50,38 --> 0:46:52,23
because that has
undermined your capacity


1006
0:46:52,23 --> 0:46:54,63
to deal with any
corruption in your country.


1007
0:46:54,63 --> 0:46:55,84
And so that's the bad news.


1008
0:46:55,84 --> 0:46:58,81
The good news is, because
this is a command structure,


1009
0:46:58,81 --> 0:47:0,67
leadership can
actually change that


1010
0:47:0,67 --> 0:47:3,165
quite quickly if there's
commitment from the top.


1011
0:47:3,165 --> 0:47:5,99



1012
0:47:5,99 --> 0:47:6,83
Any other questions?


1013
0:47:6,83 --> 0:47:9,179
Yes.


1014
0:47:9,179 --> 0:47:10,97
AUDIENCE: You make a
sensible point, right?


1015
0:47:10,97 --> 0:47:12,76
We buy the story and everything.


1016
0:47:12,76 --> 0:47:16,9
Why [INAUDIBLE], they have
the money and everything,


1017
0:47:16,9 --> 0:47:17,549
why nothing has happened?


1018
0:47:17,549 --> 0:47:19,9
GARY A. HAUGEN:
Yeah, Great question,


1019
0:47:19,9 --> 0:47:20,59
which is why isn't
everybody already


1020
0:47:20,59 --> 0:47:21,95
addressing this already?


1021
0:47:21,95 --> 0:47:23,91
That's a hard question, too.


1022
0:47:23,91 --> 0:47:27,67
And actually, I've spent the
last 10 years going around


1023
0:47:27,67 --> 0:47:29,25
to almost every
smart person I can.


1024
0:47:29,25 --> 0:47:31,631
Because as they started
to come to our eyes


1025
0:47:31,631 --> 0:47:34,13
from just the daily work in the
developing world, it's like,


1026
0:47:34,13 --> 0:47:35,566
hey, isn't this
is a big problem,


1027
0:47:35,566 --> 0:47:37,19
and isn't this just
going to get worse,


1028
0:47:37,19 --> 0:47:39,17
and don't we need to
get out in front of it?


1029
0:47:39,17 --> 0:47:41,65
There are some reasons why
it's been very difficult.


1030
0:47:41,65 --> 0:47:44,48
One of the reasons
is that the people


1031
0:47:44,48 --> 0:47:47,2
who are immersed in
the academic and sort


1032
0:47:47,2 --> 0:47:50,58
of technical disciplines
of fighting poverty


1033
0:47:50,58 --> 0:47:53,22
are just very foreign to the
world of law enforcement,


1034
0:47:53,22 --> 0:47:53,72
right?


1035
0:47:53,72 --> 0:47:56,97
So it's the economist, the
agronomist, the clean water


1036
0:47:56,97 --> 0:48:0,46
engineers, the
public health folks.


1037
0:48:0,46 --> 0:48:7,72
What it takes to actually
do a highly effective law


1038
0:48:7,72 --> 0:48:9,92
enforcement is a completely
different discipline.


1039
0:48:9,92 --> 0:48:11,71
So these worlds have
been very far apart,


1040
0:48:11,71 --> 0:48:13,85
and we're trying to
bring them together.


1041
0:48:13,85 --> 0:48:17,43
The second thing is that
it's been dangerous and scary


1042
0:48:17,43 --> 0:48:22,669
for aid organizations to engage
supporting law enforcement


1043
0:48:22,669 --> 0:48:24,96
in the developing world,
because law enforcement is not


1044
0:48:24,96 --> 0:48:26,105
a benign system.


1045
0:48:26,105 --> 0:48:28,2
Right?


1046
0:48:28,2 --> 0:48:30,5
Because it's a coercive system.


1047
0:48:30,5 --> 0:48:32,85
It's the coercive arm of the
state, and if it turns bad,


1048
0:48:32,85 --> 0:48:34,6
it commits abuses.


1049
0:48:34,6 --> 0:48:36,5
Now you helped empower
it, and you're like, oh,


1050
0:48:36,5 --> 0:48:37,3
now we're in trouble for that.


1051
0:48:37,3 --> 0:48:39,72
So we actually made
illegal after human rights


1052
0:48:39,72 --> 0:48:43,9
abuses in the 70s and
80s for aid organizations


1053
0:48:43,9 --> 0:48:45,81
to assist police.


1054
0:48:45,81 --> 0:48:48,809
Now it seemed like a good
idea to like stop the abuses,


1055
0:48:48,809 --> 0:48:50,35
but the answer to
bad law enforcement


1056
0:48:50,35 --> 0:48:52,68
is not going to be
no law enforcement.


1057
0:48:52,68 --> 0:48:54,72
So we need to say,
yeah, there's a bad way


1058
0:48:54,72 --> 0:48:57,14
to assist law enforcement.


1059
0:48:57,14 --> 0:48:59,6
But they're also clearly
now some good ways to do it,


1060
0:48:59,6 --> 0:49:1,57
and that's what
we need to pursue.


1061
0:49:1,57 --> 0:49:3,56
Thanks again for your
patience and interest.


1062
0:49:3,56 --> 0:49:7,15
And please buy the book,
and share the video,


1063
0:49:7,15 --> 0:49:9,38
and help us change the
discussion on the Millennium


1064
0:49:9,38 --> 0:49:10,13
Development Goals.


1065
0:49:10,13 --> 0:49:12,28
Thanks very much.


1066
0:49:12,28 --> 0:51:12,28
