###2 Do you know what l want to do to you tonight?
###7 - You didn't say anything. - l know.
###10 lt was gonna be kinky, and l got embarrassed.
###12 Really kinky? Was l a bad girl?
###16 Very bad. You had to go to the principal's office.
###23 l have an early shift tomorrow.
###26 - l've got to sleep. - Want me to take you home?
###28 No. But if we're gonna pick up a schoolgirl outfit and have sex,
###32 we have to leave this minute.

###40 Boink. Who's your new friend?
###42 Look, it got a letter.
###45 So l put on a few pounds.
###49 But how would you like it if somebody did this to you?
###52 l wouldn't.
###54 - l don't think it's fair. - lt isn't fair.
###56 - Now, eat your doughnut. - Eat your doughnut.
###59 <i>And I was having problems</i> <i>with my lady too,</i>
###62 Get a move on. l got tickets to <i>Bring in 'Da Noise Bring in 'Da Funk,</i>
###67 We're gonna take blood so we can check
###70 your hepatitis viral load. Absolutely no big deal.
###82 <i>No big deal at all,</i>
###84 Could somebody get that?
###100 These tests are gonna come back negative.
###103 Everybody who works in a hospital eventually gets stuck.
###106 Thanks for being so nice to me.
###108 Who wouldn't be nice to you right now?
###111 l understand you might need a refresher course in hospital safety.
###115 This is a syringe. When filled with infected blood,
###118 where is the last place you might want to stick it?
###121 - ln my arm. - Very good, Dr Dorian.
###125 Mr Sarcastic strikes again.
###128 For God's sake, sir, just fire me.
###131 Just get him to sign the damn paper.
###135 What's this?
###136 lf you develop any symptoms that suggest you may have contracted hepatitis B,
###141 this form states the hospital is not responsible.
###144 Thanks. That's comforting.
###147 l'm sure you'll be fine.
###149 Here's your pen.
###152 Keep it.
###161 ls he gonna make it?
###163 - Doesn't look good. - Yay!
###173 lsn't that what you were wearing when you left last night?

###189 Stop it.
###190 What? lt's my ''Elliot got some booty'' dance.
###196 Elliot, it's not like anybody else knows.
###200 - What's up, porn star? - Somebody toasted that marshmallow.
###206 Well?
###209 <i>Somebody got some action</i>
###214 Come on. lt's funny.
###216 l can't find my scrubs top. l must've left it at Sean's.

###222 <i>One of the hospital's</i> <i>annoying money savers,</i>

###230 - How else can l help? - Just go.
###244 Good morning, sir.
###247 And yet another proud day for Dr Reid.
###250 l'd say it can only get better, but we both know that isn't true.
###254 Right, sweetheart?
###256 Yeah.
###260 You know l'm crazy in love with you.
###262 Don't tell me you're obsessing over a joke l made.
###265 - l'm not obsessing. - Good.
###267 Careful. l just might eat you.
###269 l see it all the time: The long hours, the stress eating, no exercise.
###273 There's not a doctor here who's in shape.
###276 Nothing better than a good sweat.
###283 Turk! lt was a joke!
###286 Alrighty.
###288 What do we have here?
###290 What you've got here are four cases of Legionnaires' pneumonia.
###293 So l would start us out on lV aminoglycosides.
###296 Check for urinary legionella antigen.
###299 lt could be viral, considering my gastrointestinal situation.
###302 Here comes the fart joke.
###304 l think l may have strep pneumo.
###307 - All four of us are doctors. - Let me guess. Golf cart accident?
###312 - Playing. - Medical convention.
###315 So, what's with the antecubital venipuncture?
###319 l got hit with of one of my hep B patients' syringes.
###322 l once had a colleague who got bit by a patient with rabies.
###326 - He's OK, right? - No, he died.
###328 A friend from med school contracted leprosy.
###331 They amputated one of his toes. Popped it right off.
###334 But hepatitis. Scary stuff.
###336 - l'll be OK. - Maybe.
###340 l have to go check on a thing...
###349 To interns.
###356 - We cannot have intercourse tonight. - Stop calling it that.
###360 l'm falling so behind on my reading, and l really...
###363 Don't always assume l wanna be fooling around.
###365 Sometimes l'm happy just thinking about fooling around.
###369 Why can't couples just be together?
###372 - Why is it always about sex? - Yes, Sean.
###375 Freud said 90%  of all human behaviour is motivated by sexual impulses.
###380 30%  of my behaviour is motivated by advertising,
###383 and the rest by violence in film.
###385 For me it's 98%  getting my dad to love me, 2%  chocolate.
###391 Now, you have to stop talking to me so l can get some work done.
###401 Say it.
###404 lntercourse.
###409 Way to get your burger on.
###413 Just exactly what in the hell is this?
###416 l need to talk to you.
###418 Dr Cox, l haven't had a chance to tell you this yet. Your name rocks!
###424 Come on!
###426 This conversation stops until cabana boy here goes.
###429 - He's not the boss of me. - Todd.
###431 Cool.
###434 So how do you do it? How do you stay in shape?
###437 Discipline. Some of us work on our appearance.
###440 Could l work out with you some time?
###443 l don't know about that.
###446 l'm not particularly fond of you, although
###449 it might be fun to see you flail about for a couple of days.
###452 You know what? Forget about it.
###455 You see that guy there?
###457 That's you in five years.
###462 You in ten years.
###463 And guess what, He-Man?
###465 You in 20.
###469 l'm in.
###472 <i>I won't let those doctors scare me,</i> <i>I always get right back on the horse,</i>
###479 l'm so sorry you're alone, Mr Winston, but meningococcus is highly contagious.
###483 - l don't have anyone to talk to. - Good news, friend.
###487 The doctor is in.
###489 l asked for a newspaper, and they gave me Judy Blume books from Paediatrics.
###494 l don't know anything about those.
###497 Read <i>Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing,</i>
###499 Completely turned high school around for me.
###503 <i>You see? Nobody keeps</i> <i>John Dorian from moving on,</i>
###506 <i>Nobody,</i>
###510 We've replaced this doctor's blood with hepatitis blood.
###514 Let's see if he notices.
###516 l could be really sick here. Could you be nice for once?
###521 How's that?
###523 l have not been this happy since, well, ever.
###527 Don't you think Sean and l are a great couple?
###530 l don't know Sean, and you've never spoken to me before.
###533 We just click on every level.
###535 - God, and the sex. - My name is Vijay.
###538 Let's see who's on their game and start off with a case of pheochromocytoma.
###543 What is the initial test, Dr Reid?
###545 24-hour urinary metanephrines?
###547 Right-o. And what is your preoperative treatment?
###550 - ACE inhibitors? - Wrong-o.
###552 Why don't you attempt to crawl out of your shame hole,
###556 and tell me the aetiology of hypocalcaemia in sarcoidosis.
###562 Gutter ball!
###564 Yesterday you were running around my hospital half-naked.
###568 - Yeah, baby. - Today you're mucking up my rounds.
###571 ls your ponytail too tight?
###572 Perhaps you have a case of the boogie-woogie flu?
###575 Something is different, because you are slipping.
###581 Next patient.
###585 The key to my exercise programme is this one simple truth: l hate my body.
###590 What?
###592 The second you look in the mirror
###594 and you're happy with what you see, you just lost the battle.
###598 You should give speeches to teenage girls.
###601 - l've been looking all over for you. - Did you bring his leash?
###605 - What are you doing? - Going for a run with Dr Cox.
###608 But we were supposed to go to the park.
###611 l was gonna let you tell me how pretty l am.
###613 - See ya, chubby! - Son of a...
###615 Baby, you're prettier every day.
###620 l'm prettier in the park.
###624 <i>I don't know what it is</i> <i>but I'm noticing something,</i>

###672 Wrap it up for me, Ned.
###673 - lt's Ted. - l know.
###677 l know a guy who can take care of him for us.
###687 One phone call.

###711 - Sure, Bambi. No problem. - Thank you.
###714 <i>John Dorian's a wuss,</i>

###725 Carla, can you check Kernig and Brudzinski signs on Mr Winston?
###728 - And why can't you do it? - l would, but l don't got no mojo.
###732 l have to go lecture some med students
###735 on myocardial infarction.
###737 l saw them waiting for you in the You're Full of Crap Ward.
###742 You know the way.
###747 What are you doing here?
###749 l bought extra scrubs so you never have to work topless again.
###752 Unless you start dancing, which l'm OK with.
###756 - Great. So he's thoughtful too. - Are you mad at me?
###759 The yelling makes it seem like you're mad.
###761 You would know.
###763 You're so thoughtful and handsome, you wouldn't forget your scrubs.
###767 l don't wear scrubs. One time, l locked my keys in my car while it was running.
###772 - On a bridge. - l have to go.
###776 l'll call you later, and you can explain what just happened.
###780 Don't be embarrassed about staring at my ass.
###783 You're only human, and everybody does it anyway.
###788 Lonely?
###791 A little.
###793 - l'm doing this for someone else. - What do you say we pick it up?
###797 Let's pick it up.
###800 <i>When someone calls you out</i>
###802 <i>there's only one thing to do:</i> <i>Deal with your fear,</i>
###805 Dr Cox, could l get you to cover Mr Winston?
###808 He's my meningitis patient. A personality difference.
###811 He says tomato, and l say...
###815 ...''to-mah-to.''
###817 Sure. l'll take him. You grab my three gomers in 408.
###820 - What's wrong with them? - l assume they're sick.
###824 l thought about what you said before, and you're right.
###827 l haven't been that nice.
###829 - And? - That's it.
###831 What, do you want to go to a ballgame and share a big tub of popcorn?
###839 That's the last time l reach out.
###841 Anybody want to go to a... Not you.
###846 - Doctors. - Doctor.
###848 l love that.
###850 Dr Douglas, l got the results back from your fasting lipids.
###853 Your LLD's very elevated, so you may want to start a...
###858 HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor?
###861 - You knew the answer. - Shut up.
###863 - What's your problem? - This doesn't come easy for me.
###867 l study every night, and you know what else l do to remember all this crap?
###871 l tape record myself saying it, and l listen to myself over and over.
###875 Do you have any idea how annoying it is to hear myself go on and on and on
###882 and on?
###884 No.
###885 Come on. l have problems too. l traded my meningitis patient.
###890 Traded him like a baseball card.
###892 Wanna know why? l was afraid of him.
###895 l'm a doctor who's afraid of sick people. Wanna take a picture with me?
###899 <i>It's a weird feeling when</i> <i>you realise you've lost the respect</i>

###919 - A dumb-ass says what? - What?
###922 l said, ''A dumb-ass says what?''
###926 What?
###928 - You're down here again? - 20!
###931 Hey, baby.
###933 - You likes? - l miss you.
###937 Maybe tonight we can, you know, rent a movie and then not watch it.
###942 We just got started down here.
###947 No problem.
###949 Just don't wake me up if you get home too late, OK?
###953 Props for the commitment.
###958 - l'm out. - And there it is.
###962 l knew your ass would quit.
###964 - l got a life. - Cry me a river.
###967 My dance card is full-up too.
###969 How many nights a week are you in here?
###971 - A few. - He's being modest.
###973 He's down here polishing his guns every night.
###976 That doesn't mean l don't have a life.

###981 - You two have fun. - Dr Cox.
###984 - Can l get a spot? - l'm here for you.
###988 Oh, God.
###990 l gotta meet someone.
###992 Big kahuna, little help?
###1000 l just came by to apologise.
###1004 - For what? - l'm not sure.
###1006 But l am really sorry.
###1008 l should be the one apologising. l got so buried in work,
###1012 and then l just took it all out on you.
###1014 l'm big on forgiving people who look like they're about to kiss me.
###1023 And the work never ends.
###1025 l have to be ready for rounds, take care of my patients,
###1028 l have scut work and research papers due.
###1031 And if my internship does not go well this year,
###1034 l'm not getting a good residency next year.
###1037 And without the residency, there goes my fellowship,
###1040 and that doesn't leave a lot of time for us.
###1043 So l think that maybe we should make this more casual.
###1047 But, come on, l know l could never be casual with you.
###1050 We'd just end up here again, right?
###1055 What are you saying?
###1057 l don't know.
###1059 Then why are you saying it?
###1062 My God.
###1064 l think l'm saying that l can't make this work right now.
###1068 l've got an idea. Let's go back to where you said that you should be apologising.
###1072 Then we'll kiss again, cos that was good.
###1075 Sean, you don't understand how hard it was for me just to get to this point.
###1079 lf l don't do my best, l'm going to hate myself for ever.
###1083 What's with being the best?
###1085 What is so bad about being adequate? That's what l do.
###1088 No, you don't.
###1093 l know.
###1097 l have to go back in.
###1105 l'm just gonna stand here and wait with these flowers
###1108 cos in two minutes you'll realise what a big mistake you're making.
###1113 l hope so.
###1124 - l want my meningitis patient back. - No.
###1127 Do you know any women who hate themselves enough to date me?
###1131 - Why'd you let me switch patients? - You asked me to.
###1134 - And because of your puppy-dog eyes. - You knew l was scared.
###1138 Why didn't you tell me to deal with it?
###1140 l don't know what it was about that day.
###1142 Maybe l hadn't had enough sleep, maybe my mind was on other things.
###1146 Maybe l didn't have enough fibre, and failed to do my morning business.
###1151 l don't know what it was, but the bottom line is
###1154 l didn't feel like spelling it out for you.
###1156 You want your little speech, and that's fine, because here it is.
###1160 You're a doctor. You might get sick.
###1162 Get over it.
###1164 Thank you. Now, can l have my patient back?
###1166 No. Because, aside from his weird Judy Blume obsession,
###1172 l like him. You will be delousing Mr Schaffer.
###1176 Guy's like flypaper.
