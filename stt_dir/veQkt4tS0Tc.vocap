###7 BERNARDO: Hi, I'm Bernardo.
###8 I'm the co-producer and editor of a short documentary called
###11 Mexican Pointy Boots.
###13 The story, it's about this fashion trend that started in
###16 Matehuala, which is a town in central Mexico, about four
###19 hours north of Mexico City, where these kids started
###22 wearing these ridiculously long pointy boots to dance to
###25 music called Tribal.
###27 The music and the boots became incredibly popular.
###30 We also took those guys to perform at the Vice Mexico
###33 anniversary party last year, and it was pretty amazing.
