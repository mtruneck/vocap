###7 Gelousie asks
###8 What made you decide to just do blogging and give up teaching if you loved it so much?
###11 Were you skeptical about it at first?
###13 At which point did you decide that you could actually make money from blogging?
###17 For some of you who are new to eatyourkimchi
###19 and you restarted watching our videos
###20 and some of you have been watching us from the beginning
###23 We feel sorry for you
###24 Embarrassing actually...
###25 Our videos suck....really suck
###26 This is really good chance to explain it to people how we are blogging full time now
###31 what we were doing before,
###32 and how the heck we got to this point
###33 YES!
###33 Both of us are certified as high school teachers in Canada
###36 and we came to Korea to be teachers as well
###38 But when we came here first though
###40 we set up a blog to show up our families what life is like in Korea
###42 because after all they had no idea what it was like
###45 and was worried about us
###46 In fact, I'm sure that a lot of you planning coming to Korea
###48 are already experiencing these problems with your friends and families who are like,
###51 "Don't go!! ~~~ No water!! You can't do stuff there!!!"
###55 "What's KPOP?"
###56 So from D-1 we started to blog, just as a hobby, for ourselves and for our families
###60 Then something really weird happened
###63 Very weird...
###63 People started to subscribe our videos
###65 and we both were like
###67 WHY???
###67 WHO...WHY WOULD SOMEONE SUBSCRIBE?
###69 WE ARE SO BORING AND NERDY
###70 WHO IS THAT PERSON??
###72 I DON'T UNDERSTAND...
###73 Coming to think of it, 4 and a half years
###74 WHY ARE YOU WATCHING OUR VIDEOS??
###79 WE ARE SO NERDY AND WEIRD...
###80 DORKY.....I DON'T UNDERSTAND
###82 ME NIETHER
###82 So some of you know that part of our history
###85 but a lot of people don't know is that, during my 2 years of teacher in Korea
###88 I had a really rough time as a teacher
###90 Meemers said it was a rough time also...
###95 So then I thought, since we are getting in more popular
###98 What if I decided to work as full-time for a year while Martina teaches for her 3rd year
###103 which ....
###109 Actually what you meant to say was that I was your sugar mama for you
###112 Buy me this T-shirt!!
###115 Give me some money!!! I'm so hungry!!!
###118 Home in my pjs working on my website while my wife brings home the money
###122 Our website..was not actually making any money after 2years..
###126 It had potential ... but for those few months after I started to do this for full time
###132 REALLY....TOUGH TIMES...
###134 So the big goal for us to be were just able to work together
###137 like if we were both teachers we are in separate schools but we love each other a lot
###140 and we wanna be with each other all the time
###141 so why don't we have a job while we can work with each other all the time
###144 This is really like our rookie groupy year
###147 We only had one salary coming in, which was my salary
###149 We had to pay the half the rent since you weren't a teacher anymore
###151 We were still paying off for our student loans
###153 we would run out money by the end of the month because we had to pay our bills
###155 We would have no food to eat
###157 Yes we were not eating for....last week of the month
###160 EVERYTHING!!!
###161 It was our rookie group year ..so much ramen
###164 SO MUCH RAMEN.....
###166 It was a really hard year for us
###168 By the end of Martina's 3rd year of teaching, that was when we realized
###171 "Yes, she could quit teaching, we both could live off the blog!
###173 Yes it was going to be more difficult because we would be cutting off her salary as a teacher as well
###177 But it's something we can do, we tighten our belts and can get through it!!"
###181 And we wouldn't eat
###182 And a lot of people don't realize is that, it was a really stressful 2 years for us really
###185 cuz it's a risky thing to do,
###187 we are not on a contract, we weren't being paid monthly by someone
###190 It's risky, if our videos flop.. then we are not getting paid or
###194 if people stop liking us and everyone unsubscribes and leaves....
###196 then we'll become lonely and we'll be out on the streets and have a homeless cup and we'll be really sad
###202 So to clarify, we are not actually hired by any company
###205 the Korean government doesn't give us any money,
###207 no music industry is giving us money
###209 we are just working off as Youtube partnership and our own website ads
###213 And also this is just two of us, we don't have a PR team
###217 we don't have a staff of camera men or video editors,
###219 we don't have makeup artists, we don't have stylist , we don't have writers
###222 we are just two of us
###225 "We can make it if we try ~~~
###227 JUST THE TWO OF US~~
###229 YOU AND I
###230 Don't forget about me guise~~
###232 Spudgy works hard also
###233 Just the three of us~~
###235 Meemers...
###236 JUST THE FOUR OF US~~
###238 And when i decided not to return to my school for 4th year.
###240 it was actually really really hard for me
###242 I cried and cried and cried
###243 and for the first 6, 7 months I'll say
###246 "I'm still a teacher....I'm not used to this blogging thing"
###249 She would keep talking about her students
###250 You don't have anymore students....
###252 YOUR STUDENTS ARE ALL DEAD...
###255 I didn't say that they were all dead, I'm not that mean
###258 So the big question that everyone wants to know
###260 "How is it possible to make money from blogging?"
###261 Actually this is quite simple, when you watch our videos in Youtubes
###265 you see like a preroll ad or ad at the bottom or ad on the side,
###268 or if you visit our websites you see the ads on the side as well
###271 we make money for those ads
###272 The more people watch our videos, the more people visit our sites
###275 the more money we make
###276 Except, if you are one of those people who use ad blocks that you don't see any ads
###281 which we make no money whatsoever which means...
###284 Every time you use ad blocks, you visit our site or watch our videos
###288 Spudgy goes hungry
###290 You want Spudgy to be hungry?
###291 Is that what you want?
###292 And especially you China, because we know that sites download our videos and re upload them
###298 so we make no money out of it
###299 China...I've got eye on you....
###301 You are watching these videos for free..
###303 for small exchange, watch an ad at the beginning of the video
###306 Can you say that in more cooperate ways?
###308 No..
###308 Now we really appreciate of the fans support that people buy our T-Shirts
###311 because that T-Shirt money goes to us and you don't had to buy those T-Shirts
###315 like you can keep watching those videos for free
###317 Those direct support of us and sites and we really appreciate that and thank you very much
###321 And if you guys can't afford the shirts we don't wanna put pressure on people
###324 Just thank you for watching our videos in general
###326 Just by watching our video you are giving your support that way as well,
###328 and Spudgy food and Meemersworth pats and kisses
###331 So currently we are trying to get a business visa in Korea that we could set up eatyourkimchi as a business
###336 and we are saving up money to apply for it
###338 because getting business visas is not cheap...
###341 and it takes a long time to apply it and we could not do it outside of Korea
###344 and we've been working on this for awhile
###345 What we are hoping to do is that actually set up a business that we could actually hire editors
###349 that could help us with the workload and we could maybe hire a videographer help us out as well
###352 It's totally awesome guys
###354 We want to get more video segments for you guys
###357 we have so many ideas and things we wanna do,
###358 just don't have enough time and for those of you who edit videos
###361 you know that it is the most time vampire in the world!
###364 Like if we film one video, a WANK, it could take us like 8 hours to film
###369 and then editing, that could be 6 to 10 hours, exporting and uploading it
###374 It could take us a day or an a half for one video
###375 Literally we don't have enough time in the day for one video but we do it
###380 So this is our very long answer to this really complicated question
###384 I hope you have a better understanding what we are doing now
###386 You can check on our blog post on our website for more details about it
###390 we don't wanna just ramble on and on in this video
###391 30 minutes!!
###392 So that's for this week's TL;DR
###394 If you have a question for next TL;DR, leave your question on the comment section below
###397 or you can check out the question that are already asked, and you can thumb them up
###402 and hope we notice that question and choose it
###403 And don't forget to subscribe for more TL;DRs
###405 and not to watch us video with ad block
###407 Cuz it would make us really sad
###408 and Spudgy very sad
###410 and Meemers really sad
###412 HEY AD BLOCK!
