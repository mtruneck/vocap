1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,455



2
0:0:1,455 --> 0:0:3,3
-Hey, what is that?


3
0:0:3,3 --> 0:0:5,97
FABIAN ALOMAR: It's a mirror
that I had in prison.


4
0:0:5,97 --> 0:0:10,38
I had this for the last five
years I was there.


5
0:0:10,38 --> 0:0:14,12
You've got to smuggle
it wherever you go.


6
0:0:14,12 --> 0:0:20,565
I'd be shaving and looking
at myself in the mirror.


7
0:0:20,565 --> 0:0:23,28



8
0:0:23,28 --> 0:0:27,34
Then, I could see who's
coming or who's going.


9
0:0:27,34 --> 0:0:29,49
When they come and search
your cell, they


10
0:0:29,49 --> 0:0:31,6
hit yourself so hard.


11
0:0:31,6 --> 0:0:33,64
And they like to break things
and take things.


12
0:0:33,64 --> 0:0:38,78
So this mirror has made it with
me most of the time--


13
0:0:38,78 --> 0:0:41,97
more than half of
my way in there.


14
0:0:41,97 --> 0:0:44,36
STEVEN CALES: Skating is
Peter Smolik said--


15
0:0:44,36 --> 0:0:45,19
there's no coaches.


16
0:0:45,19 --> 0:0:46,55
You're your own boss.


17
0:0:46,55 --> 0:0:50,33
So there's really no structure
is the right word-- to be


18
0:0:50,33 --> 0:0:52,31
like, hey, you've
got to get up.


19
0:0:52,31 --> 0:0:53,78
You've got to do this.


20
0:0:53,78 --> 0:0:57,59
And we do what we want.


21
0:0:57,59 --> 0:1:0,8
So you've got to live
and learn, you


22
0:1:0,8 --> 0:1:2,5
know what I'm saying?


23
0:1:2,5 --> 0:1:8,28



24
0:1:8,28 --> 0:1:10,55
FABIAN ALOMAR: How we even got
into skating was crazy.


25
0:1:10,55 --> 0:1:12,55
I stole my first board.


26
0:1:12,55 --> 0:1:13,32
I didn't even know
about skating.


27
0:1:13,32 --> 0:1:16,87
I see two oriental kids on the
block when we were on bikes.


28
0:1:16,87 --> 0:1:19,75
And we went and told them that
we could borrow their


29
0:1:19,75 --> 0:1:22,42
skateboards, because they seen
them hopping on the board.


30
0:1:22,42 --> 0:1:23,52
I hit them up, like
how much are they?


31
0:1:23,52 --> 0:1:24,39
How much are these boards?


32
0:1:24,39 --> 0:1:28,46
And they told us this price, and
it was $49.50 at the time.


33
0:1:28,46 --> 0:1:31,11
$49.50 is a lot of money
for my mom and dad.


34
0:1:31,11 --> 0:1:33,4
So where do we go?


35
0:1:33,4 --> 0:1:37,88
We went out towards Beverly
Hills, Eagle Rock, Glendale


36
0:1:37,88 --> 0:1:39,36
looking around.


37
0:1:39,36 --> 0:1:41,93
And I hate to say it, but we
were looking around for little


38
0:1:41,93 --> 0:1:43,193
white boys to rob them.


39
0:1:43,193 --> 0:1:48,13



40
0:1:48,13 --> 0:1:50,2
JOEY SURIEL: I had seen him
skate a few times when he


41
0:1:50,2 --> 0:1:54,24
would come riding around with
our other friend, Juan.


42
0:1:54,24 --> 0:1:56,58
And I knew these guys were
on top of their game.


43
0:1:56,58 --> 0:1:59,3
They were the best I had seen,
so I said, OK, there are the


44
0:1:59,3 --> 0:2:1,33
guys I need to be around.


45
0:2:1,33 --> 0:2:2,53
I wanted to be around
the best.


46
0:2:2,53 --> 0:2:8,68
And I knew that being around
Fabian was going to help me.


47
0:2:8,68 --> 0:2:11,11
FABIAN ALOMAR: Back in the day,
back in '87, '88, we used


48
0:2:11,11 --> 0:2:14,46
to go to this ramp on 23rd
and Vermont near USC.


49
0:2:14,46 --> 0:2:17,64
And to get there, you've got to
pass through at least three


50
0:2:17,64 --> 0:2:18,86
or four different gang
neighborhoods.


51
0:2:18,86 --> 0:2:19,73
-At least, at least.


52
0:2:19,73 --> 0:2:21,5
FABIAN ALOMAR: So to get
there and to come


53
0:2:21,5 --> 0:2:23,62
back home was a mission.


54
0:2:23,62 --> 0:2:26,755
-I lived in a gang
neighborhood.


55
0:2:26,755 --> 0:2:27,3
FABIAN ALOMAR: Rockwood.


56
0:2:27,3 --> 0:2:31,97
-And I guess a rival gang had
come looking to shoot up, and


57
0:2:31,97 --> 0:2:34,355
they actually caught us
right when Fabian


58
0:2:34,355 --> 0:2:35,585
was about to leave.


59
0:2:35,585 --> 0:2:38,4
And I was like, all right,
man, I'll see you later.


60
0:2:38,4 --> 0:2:40,81
FABIAN ALOMAR: It was a burgundy
Regal with a sun


61
0:2:40,81 --> 0:2:41,24
roof.


62
0:2:41,24 --> 0:2:43,45
-And then soon as I look, I was
like, yo, these guys are


63
0:2:43,45 --> 0:2:44,455
cruising by real slow.


64
0:2:44,455 --> 0:2:45,31
FABIAN ALOMAR: It
was like this.


65
0:2:45,31 --> 0:2:48,5
-All of a sudden, bro, all I
remember was some dude coming


66
0:2:48,5 --> 0:2:50,57
out of the roof-- yo,
the first time


67
0:2:50,57 --> 0:2:53,5
I've see a real Uzi.


68
0:2:53,5 --> 0:2:56,64
I remember when you are in here,
it was like you in a


69
0:2:56,64 --> 0:2:57,8
different world.


70
0:2:57,8 --> 0:3:0,16
You forget that you
were in the hood.


71
0:3:0,16 --> 0:3:0,83
You forget.


72
0:3:0,83 --> 0:3:3,47
There'd be I don't even know
how many shootouts


73
0:3:3,47 --> 0:3:5,87
we've see back then.


74
0:3:5,87 --> 0:3:7,81
-You think it's a
nicer area now?


75
0:3:7,81 --> 0:3:8,92
FABIAN ALOMAR: Now,
it's way nicer.


76
0:3:8,92 --> 0:3:12,38
Echo Park all the way up to
here at Silver Lake, as of


77
0:3:12,38 --> 0:3:16,67
2002 or 2003, it
really changed.


78
0:3:16,67 --> 0:3:20,6
You see a lot more artsy people
living in Echo Park


79
0:3:20,6 --> 0:3:21,78
running around now.


80
0:3:21,78 --> 0:3:23,23
Back then--


81
0:3:23,23 --> 0:3:25,26
I grew up, born and
raised there--


82
0:3:25,26 --> 0:3:28,53
and you would never seen that.


83
0:3:28,53 --> 0:3:33,56
Yeah, all right in this area
right here there's Crazies,


84
0:3:33,56 --> 0:3:36,59
Echo Park, Headhunters
and Diamond.


85
0:3:36,59 --> 0:3:37,72
We're on Douglas Street.


86
0:3:37,72 --> 0:3:40,45
If you go two blocks
up and to the left,


87
0:3:40,45 --> 0:3:41,68
that's Diamond's street.


88
0:3:41,68 --> 0:3:43,49
This is Headhunters.


89
0:3:43,49 --> 0:3:44,35
-So why is that?


90
0:3:44,35 --> 0:3:46,3
Why don't--


91
0:3:46,3 --> 0:3:48,54
FABIAN ALOMAR: It's
just who it is.


92
0:3:48,54 --> 0:3:52,7
A group of kids that grew up on
this block didn't get along


93
0:3:52,7 --> 0:3:55,48
with the group of kids that
are on that block.


94
0:3:55,48 --> 0:3:58,7
And that's how it started.


95
0:3:58,7 --> 0:3:59,59
Back in the '80s.


96
0:3:59,59 --> 0:4:3,7
And there's always been 18th
Street lurking around.


97
0:4:3,7 --> 0:4:5,57



98
0:4:5,57 --> 0:4:7,43
Our whole family was
raised right here.


99
0:4:7,43 --> 0:4:8,23
We lived here.


100
0:4:8,23 --> 0:4:11,502
My mom, she was raised
right here, too.


101
0:4:11,502 --> 0:4:12,384
-In this house.


102
0:4:12,384 --> 0:4:14,15
FABIAN ALOMAR: In this
house, yeah.


103
0:4:14,15 --> 0:4:16,7
If you're talking about gang
area, this is Headhunters.


104
0:4:16,7 --> 0:4:18,329
-This is where you
started skating?


105
0:4:18,329 --> 0:4:20,26
FABIAN ALOMAR: No,
I was too small.


106
0:4:20,26 --> 0:4:22,316
Right here was just me
growing up, learning


107
0:4:22,316 --> 0:4:24,26
how to ride a bike.


108
0:4:24,26 --> 0:4:25,78
-Those are bullet holes.


109
0:4:25,78 --> 0:4:26,395
FABIAN ALOMAR: Yeah.


110
0:4:26,395 --> 0:4:27,36
Look, you can see.


111
0:4:27,36 --> 0:4:29,12
Those are bullet holes
right there.


112
0:4:29,12 --> 0:4:31,38
If these streets could talk,
they'd have a better story to


113
0:4:31,38 --> 0:4:32,99
tell you than what I could--


114
0:4:32,99 --> 0:4:35,6
a way better story.


115
0:4:35,6 --> 0:4:38,18
Like I said, a lot of my friends
in skateboarding used


116
0:4:38,18 --> 0:4:46,43
to really trip out on how they
would see my dad or my uncles,


117
0:4:46,43 --> 0:4:49,27
my sisters, everybody
in my family, were


118
0:4:49,27 --> 0:4:51,81
considered gang members.


119
0:4:51,81 --> 0:4:57,18
And you're guilty by
association, regardless.


120
0:4:57,18 --> 0:4:59,18
A lot of the times, they
wouldn't even want to drop me


121
0:4:59,18 --> 0:4:59,85
off at home.


122
0:4:59,85 --> 0:5:1,28
Like I said, they would--


123
0:5:1,28 --> 0:5:4,54
two blocks away and let
me walk the rest.


124
0:5:4,54 --> 0:5:5,82
GINO IANNUCCI: Well, I remember
meeting Fabian.


125
0:5:5,82 --> 0:5:7,74
And the first impression was
that he was a nice guy.


126
0:5:7,74 --> 0:5:9,47
He was really cool.


127
0:5:9,47 --> 0:5:10,74
He was just down to
introduce himself.


128
0:5:10,74 --> 0:5:13,27
And he was just a good guy.


129
0:5:13,27 --> 0:5:14,48
But I knew that he was real.


130
0:5:14,48 --> 0:5:17,955
I knew that if a time came when
he had to throw down or


131
0:5:17,955 --> 0:5:19,73
anything like that, I wouldn't
want to fuck with him.


132
0:5:19,73 --> 0:5:23,74
And I knew that his family was
all up in it and skateboarding


133
0:5:23,74 --> 0:5:25,17
kept him away from that.


134
0:5:25,17 --> 0:5:26,74
-Were you in a gang or
anything like that?


135
0:5:26,74 --> 0:5:29,2
Or just joined what
they were doing?


136
0:5:29,2 --> 0:5:30,57
FABIAN ALOMAR: Yeah, I did.


137
0:5:30,57 --> 0:5:33,39
But I never got too
deep into it.


138
0:5:33,39 --> 0:5:34,96
I knew it was always there,
because I was


139
0:5:34,96 --> 0:5:36,41
born into it, man.


140
0:5:36,41 --> 0:5:40,1
There's no oh, I want to go
hang out with these guys.


141
0:5:40,1 --> 0:5:41,715
I'd go home and I'd
be with them guys,


142
0:5:41,715 --> 0:5:43,56
you know what I mean?


143
0:5:43,56 --> 0:5:45,56
It's a difference when you've
got to go somewhere and be


144
0:5:45,56 --> 0:5:49,59
with your home boys
or your gang.


145
0:5:49,59 --> 0:5:51,26
But when you go home and
you live with it,


146
0:5:51,26 --> 0:5:53,6
it's nothing to you.


147
0:5:53,6 --> 0:5:54,85
It's just how you are.


148
0:5:54,85 --> 0:6:3,97



149
0:6:3,97 --> 0:6:7,26
-Who would you say, out of the
Menace guys was the most


150
0:6:7,26 --> 0:6:8,55
motivated to get tricks?


151
0:6:8,55 --> 0:6:11,88
SOCRATES LEAL: Probably
Joey and Fabian.


152
0:6:11,88 --> 0:6:13,54
Those guys were always
motivated.


153
0:6:13,54 --> 0:6:14,89
Fabian would call me.


154
0:6:14,89 --> 0:6:15,88
You want to go film?


155
0:6:15,88 --> 0:6:16,39
Like, yeah.


156
0:6:16,39 --> 0:6:19,6
-Were there, though, a lot of
other crazy stories, filming


157
0:6:19,6 --> 0:6:20,21
with Fabian?


158
0:6:20,21 --> 0:6:24,4
SOCRATES LEAL: I wouldn't say
just crazy, just maybe not


159
0:6:24,4 --> 0:6:25,75
normal for regular skaters.


160
0:6:25,75 --> 0:6:29,55
But Fabian wasn't like
your regular skater.


161
0:6:29,55 --> 0:6:30,93
He just didn't take bullshit.


162
0:6:30,93 --> 0:6:33,82



163
0:6:33,82 --> 0:6:37,24
JOEY SURIEL: Since we were
kids, Fabian always had a


164
0:6:37,24 --> 0:6:38,42
short fuse.


165
0:6:38,42 --> 0:6:44,3
Not to mention everything was
put on a platter for us, from


166
0:6:44,3 --> 0:6:46,9
women to drugs to fame.


167
0:6:46,9 --> 0:6:51,16
So you add that to the formula,
and it's a recipe for


168
0:6:51,16 --> 0:6:52,41
destruction.


169
0:6:52,41 --> 0:6:55,61



170
0:6:55,61 --> 0:6:58,89
FABIAN ALOMAR: Skateboarding
saved me from getting into


171
0:6:58,89 --> 0:7:1,79
trouble, but at the same time,
I think I had a lot of time


172
0:7:1,79 --> 0:7:3,32
and money in my hands.


173
0:7:3,32 --> 0:7:6,72
From not having nothing to have
a little something, it


174
0:7:6,72 --> 0:7:7,455
felt pretty good.


175
0:7:7,455 --> 0:7:9,77
And sometimes you think
you're invincible.


176
0:7:9,77 --> 0:7:13,7



177
0:7:13,7 --> 0:7:14,5
Oh, man, you know what?


178
0:7:14,5 --> 0:7:16,16
I've got to take you
to this house.


179
0:7:16,16 --> 0:7:16,865
It was a drug house.


180
0:7:16,865 --> 0:7:19,58
Instead of having
a big pitbull, I


181
0:7:19,58 --> 0:7:21,18
was their guard dog.


182
0:7:21,18 --> 0:7:23,49
They know that I used to
skateboard and everything.


183
0:7:23,49 --> 0:7:24,19
They trusted me.


184
0:7:24,19 --> 0:7:26,83
When my money was good,
they loved me.


185
0:7:26,83 --> 0:7:27,61
You know what I mean?


186
0:7:27,61 --> 0:7:30,12
When the money was good, I had
all kinds of money to buy dope


187
0:7:30,12 --> 0:7:33,59
from them and to give them
skateboards when they need it


188
0:7:33,59 --> 0:7:34,95
for their kids or whatever.


189
0:7:34,95 --> 0:7:38,74
And then when my money
ran out, guess what?


190
0:7:38,74 --> 0:7:40,247
They didn't like me no more.


191
0:7:40,247 --> 0:7:48,14



192
0:7:48,14 --> 0:7:49,91
FABIAN ALOMAR: I was selling
and doing, mostly doing.


193
0:7:49,91 --> 0:7:54,35
But one thing I did and I'm
thankful for is I separated


194
0:7:54,35 --> 0:7:58,18
the gang life and my drug use
and my skateboarding--


195
0:7:58,18 --> 0:8:2,27
for a lot of reasons, mainly
because I was embarrassed and


196
0:8:2,27 --> 0:8:3,92
I didn't want to show my face.


197
0:8:3,92 --> 0:8:7,99
And I was looked at as Fabian
Alomar, pro skater.


198
0:8:7,99 --> 0:8:8,92
He's a good skater.


199
0:8:8,92 --> 0:8:10,87
A real ghetto kid,
real coming up.


200
0:8:10,87 --> 0:8:14,5
And I didn't want
to ruin that.


201
0:8:14,5 --> 0:8:16,49
That image I had was good,
because I kept skating and I


202
0:8:16,49 --> 0:8:18,96
produced and I did everything
I was supposed to do.


203
0:8:18,96 --> 0:8:21,81
But I felt this weird
feeling inside.


204
0:8:21,81 --> 0:8:23,15
I couldn't come around.


205
0:8:23,15 --> 0:8:25,11
I didn't want to burn
no bridges.


206
0:8:25,11 --> 0:8:27,38
I couldn't burn my bridges
with skateboarding.


207
0:8:27,38 --> 0:8:28,36
I wanted to keep it separate.


208
0:8:28,36 --> 0:8:29,385
So I stood in the hood.


209
0:8:29,385 --> 0:8:32,46
I stood around in the spots
where no one will come.


210
0:8:32,46 --> 0:8:34,28
JAVIER NUNEZ: He grew up in the
streets, so it was tough


211
0:8:34,28 --> 0:8:40,909
to make a transition to being
a full on skate and shit.


212
0:8:40,909 --> 0:8:43,65
You skate and then you go back
to the hood, and then you're


213
0:8:43,65 --> 0:8:45,36
dealing with all these
obstacles.


214
0:8:45,36 --> 0:8:47,38
It's not like we're going back
to the suburbs and it's all


215
0:8:47,38 --> 0:8:49,3
good and we can skate
every day.


216
0:8:49,3 --> 0:8:50,5
It wasn't like.


217
0:8:50,5 --> 0:8:53,26
And it caught up to them.


218
0:8:53,26 --> 0:8:56,78
Fabian got locked up.


219
0:8:56,78 --> 0:8:58,6
That's when [INAUDIBLE]
was like, you know?


220
0:8:58,6 --> 0:9:2,52
I got to think about making it
a real skate company, not


221
0:9:2,52 --> 0:9:4,51
about an image thing.


222
0:9:4,51 --> 0:9:6,3
FABIAN ALOMAR: There were so
many things going on in my


223
0:9:6,3 --> 0:9:10,38
life at the time that it
was bound to happen.


224
0:9:10,38 --> 0:9:13,32
I showed up to Karim's house to
pick up my check one day.


225
0:9:13,32 --> 0:9:15,59
And he's telling me, you know
this is probably one of your


226
0:9:15,59 --> 0:9:17,7
last checks right here.


227
0:9:17,7 --> 0:9:20,8
This is it.


228
0:9:20,8 --> 0:9:24,72
I've cut you so low that I can't
be-- and now, I don't


229
0:9:24,72 --> 0:9:25,53
see you doing anything.


230
0:9:25,53 --> 0:9:26,53
And I'm telling them--


231
0:9:26,53 --> 0:9:29,84
and it's true-- my ankle
was swollen, but


232
0:9:29,84 --> 0:9:34,87
from skating on dope.


233
0:9:34,87 --> 0:9:41,42
Once I got kicked off, things
took a whole other turn.


234
0:9:41,42 --> 0:9:43,8
See where that bungalow is?


235
0:9:43,8 --> 0:9:43,45
-Yeah.


236
0:9:43,45 --> 0:9:46,64
FABIAN ALOMAR: That fence where
the diamond is, the


237
0:9:46,64 --> 0:9:48,97
baseball diamond?


238
0:9:48,97 --> 0:9:50,11
There's bathrooms right there.


239
0:9:50,11 --> 0:9:50,36
You see?


240
0:9:50,36 --> 0:9:50,77
There they are.


241
0:9:50,77 --> 0:9:51,69
The white bathrooms?


242
0:9:51,69 --> 0:9:54,49
Those were my offices,
my [SPANISH].


243
0:9:54,49 --> 0:9:56,98
Anybody who when in there
got fucked up while


244
0:9:56,98 --> 0:9:58,48
I was smoking crack.


245
0:9:58,48 --> 0:10:1,1
These dudes playing tennis,
these little Filipino dudes


246
0:10:1,1 --> 0:10:3,8
and shit-- they all all go in
there in the morning and


247
0:10:3,8 --> 0:10:5,26
they're like, (ACCENT) hey, it's
7 o'clock in the morning.


248
0:10:5,26 --> 0:10:7,17
Let's go play some tennis.


249
0:10:7,17 --> 0:10:9,71
And they go in there and they
want to play tennis and they


250
0:10:9,71 --> 0:10:12,22
want-- (ACCENT) hey, why is the
bathroom locked and shit?


251
0:10:12,22 --> 0:10:13,5
I could hear them talking.


252
0:10:13,5 --> 0:10:16,0
And they would try to force it
open, because I'd locked it on


253
0:10:16,0 --> 0:10:19,12
purpose because I'm in there
smoking dope looking at nudie


254
0:10:19,12 --> 0:10:20,19
magazines and shit.


255
0:10:20,19 --> 0:10:21,18
And that's what I did.


256
0:10:21,18 --> 0:10:22,95
I'd do me and do me.


257
0:10:22,95 --> 0:10:24,78
So I'm in there fucking
doing my thing.


258
0:10:24,78 --> 0:10:28,32
Wait, that's my church.


259
0:10:28,32 --> 0:10:32,405
So I'm getting loaded in there,
and they're fucking up


260
0:10:32,405 --> 0:10:35,71
my high by trying to get
into my offices.


261
0:10:35,71 --> 0:10:37,846
And I'd be like, man,
what the fuck?


262
0:10:37,846 --> 0:10:40,915
So when they come in, all
they did was get robbed.


263
0:10:40,915 --> 0:10:44,7
I'd fuck them up and then
I'd end up leaving.


264
0:10:44,7 --> 0:10:47,47
I would say a prayer before
I go rob you.


265
0:10:47,47 --> 0:10:49,89
God, please don't let
me get caught.


266
0:10:49,89 --> 0:10:50,99
Don't let me get hurt.


267
0:10:50,99 --> 0:10:52,85
I'm sorry for what
I'm about to do.


268
0:10:52,85 --> 0:10:58,14
I know it's wrong, but I feel
like I have no choice.


269
0:10:58,14 --> 0:11:1,7
And so I would go and rob this
person and jack them.


270
0:11:1,7 --> 0:11:5,325
And I'd let them know, hey,
straight up, I'm on dope.


271
0:11:5,325 --> 0:11:7,71
I'm smoking crack.


272
0:11:7,71 --> 0:11:9,54
You'd better give me all
your money or you're


273
0:11:9,54 --> 0:11:11,96
going to get hurt.


274
0:11:11,96 --> 0:11:14,55
And if you don't give it up,
believe me, I'm going to cut


275
0:11:14,55 --> 0:11:16,9
you or I'm going to shoot you.


276
0:11:16,9 --> 0:11:20,2
So you're bound to give it up
either way, whether you want


277
0:11:20,2 --> 0:11:23,52
to walk away or me drive away
with you laying there.


278
0:11:23,52 --> 0:11:26,29
So most of the time, they
would cooperate.


279
0:11:26,29 --> 0:11:29,7
And I was driving people
right outside my door.


280
0:11:29,7 --> 0:11:32,64
When you're on cocaine, that
stuff really plays a number on


281
0:11:32,64 --> 0:11:33,52
your head, you know
what I mean?


282
0:11:33,52 --> 0:11:35,9
So I would do it
at all times--


283
0:11:35,9 --> 0:11:36,7
in the evening.


284
0:11:36,7 --> 0:11:38,55
If I catch you slipping,
I would get you


285
0:11:38,55 --> 0:11:39,75
and rob you, whatever.


286
0:11:39,75 --> 0:11:42,69
That was my mentality.


287
0:11:42,69 --> 0:11:45,6
Come here, puppy.


288
0:11:45,6 --> 0:11:48,3
Look at these dogs, man.


289
0:11:48,3 --> 0:11:50,39
They've probably been so abused
that they don't trust


290
0:11:50,39 --> 0:11:51,786
nobody, dude.


291
0:11:51,786 --> 0:11:53,23
Look, there he comes.


292
0:11:53,23 --> 0:11:53,725
Get it.


293
0:11:53,725 --> 0:11:54,975
Get it.


294
0:11:54,975 --> 0:11:57,585



295
0:11:57,585 --> 0:11:58,96
I'm not proud of it, man.


296
0:11:58,96 --> 0:12:2,57
I'm not boasting about it.


297
0:12:2,57 --> 0:12:7,59
I'm not trying to put any light
on it in a positive way.


298
0:12:7,59 --> 0:12:9,0
It's a negative thing
I was doing.


299
0:12:9,0 --> 0:12:9,96
It was bad.


300
0:12:9,96 --> 0:12:17,28
But at that point my life,
I didn't care.


301
0:12:17,28 --> 0:12:18,63
I didn't care about nothing.


302
0:12:18,63 --> 0:12:20,61
I didn't even care about myself,
so why would I care


303
0:12:20,61 --> 0:12:21,86
about somebody else?


304
0:12:21,86 --> 0:12:24,64
BILLY VALDES: I think with
Fabian, too, that might have


305
0:12:24,64 --> 0:12:27,62
been a consequence of adjusting
after skateboarding.


306
0:12:27,62 --> 0:12:31,38
The last time I seen Fabian,
I was hungover living in


307
0:12:31,38 --> 0:12:33,79
Hollywood, and he came over
the next morning.


308
0:12:33,79 --> 0:12:35,88
And I hadn't seen him
in a long time.


309
0:12:35,88 --> 0:12:40,23
And he wanted to sell me a
pitbull puppy, because he


310
0:12:40,23 --> 0:12:44,9
knows I'm into dogs,
or some sodas--


311
0:12:44,9 --> 0:12:45,81
cases of sodas.


312
0:12:45,81 --> 0:12:48,97
And he with some dude
in a random band.


313
0:12:48,97 --> 0:12:51,19
So it was a trip for me.


314
0:12:51,19 --> 0:12:53,11
FABIAN ALOMAR: You want to ride
down the alley where I


315
0:12:53,11 --> 0:12:54,98
got arrested for my crime?


316
0:12:54,98 --> 0:12:56,155
This is where I got arrested.


317
0:12:56,155 --> 0:12:57,88
They cornered me in here.


318
0:12:57,88 --> 0:13:1,1
There was five cop cars
here and a helicopter.


319
0:13:1,1 --> 0:13:3,15
And they caught me right in
this alley right here.


320
0:13:3,15 --> 0:13:4,3
They surrounded me.


321
0:13:4,3 --> 0:13:4,98
I was busted right here.


322
0:13:4,98 --> 0:13:5,95
They told me, get out the car.


323
0:13:5,95 --> 0:13:8,9
They were behind me, in front
of me, and I was just trying


324
0:13:8,9 --> 0:13:9,8
to make it to my--


325
0:13:9,8 --> 0:13:12,9
my mom lived two houses away
from the dope spot where we


326
0:13:12,9 --> 0:13:13,43
were just that.


327
0:13:13,43 --> 0:13:15,14
And I was trying to make it to
my mom's, because I knew these


328
0:13:15,14 --> 0:13:17,45
cops were probably going
to beat my ass.


329
0:13:17,45 --> 0:13:18,4
That was it right there.


330
0:13:18,4 --> 0:13:19,11
I got locked up.


331
0:13:19,11 --> 0:13:20,36
I was done.


332
0:13:20,36 --> 0:13:22,46



333
0:13:22,46 --> 0:13:25,36
I went to prison for
eight years.


334
0:13:25,36 --> 0:13:31,3
I got arrested for carjacking,
kidnapping, robbery, with an


335
0:13:31,3 --> 0:13:32,89
11 inch ice pick.


336
0:13:32,89 --> 0:13:43,3
The ice pick had someone's DNA,
and it had crack residue,


337
0:13:43,3 --> 0:13:49,36
because I was using that same
weapon that I used to


338
0:13:49,36 --> 0:13:54,15
whatever, stab, and I was
using it to smoke.


339
0:13:54,15 --> 0:13:59,5
And that's why I had it.


340
0:13:59,5 --> 0:14:3,71
They sent me to Salinas
Valley, level four.


341
0:14:3,71 --> 0:14:6,49
I was in the 270 yard there.


342
0:14:6,49 --> 0:14:9,66
And it's nothing but
solid lifers.


343
0:14:9,66 --> 0:14:10,48
People got life.


344
0:14:10,48 --> 0:14:16,77
People were just straight
killers and drug dealers and


345
0:14:16,77 --> 0:14:18,2
nothing bad at all.


346
0:14:18,2 --> 0:14:20,69



347
0:14:20,69 --> 0:14:22,58
You notice nobody smiles
in prison.


348
0:14:22,58 --> 0:14:26,96
So you don't get those smiles.


349
0:14:26,96 --> 0:14:28,64
-You show up the
first day and--


350
0:14:28,64 --> 0:14:32,98
FABIAN ALOMAR: You show
up, you're new fish.


351
0:14:32,98 --> 0:14:34,42
You're in prison.


352
0:14:34,42 --> 0:14:35,67
You're sketchy on everything.


353
0:14:35,67 --> 0:14:43,7



354
0:14:43,7 --> 0:14:45,2
FABIAN ALOMAR: That's
a good question.


355
0:14:45,2 --> 0:14:48,92
If you were raised here and
brought up here and you've got


356
0:14:48,92 --> 0:14:57,82
that the southern Hispanic ways,
then you're considered


357
0:14:57,82 --> 0:14:58,85
South sider.


358
0:14:58,85 --> 0:15:1,55
You're a homie automatically,
and don't try to get out of it


359
0:15:1,55 --> 0:15:3,42
and don't try to fight it,
because a lot of dudes try to


360
0:15:3,42 --> 0:15:6,19
deny just to get away
and try to hide.


361
0:15:6,19 --> 0:15:11,8
But if you're actually a Puerto
Rican native and come


362
0:15:11,8 --> 0:15:14,98
over here and you don't know
what the hell's going on, then


363
0:15:14,98 --> 0:15:17,58
they'll give you a pass and
you could be an other.


364
0:15:17,58 --> 0:15:18,76
You could be an other.


365
0:15:18,76 --> 0:15:21,25
Other is--


366
0:15:21,25 --> 0:15:27,0
you could be Samoan, Chinese,
you could be whatever.


367
0:15:27,0 --> 0:15:28,69
Others is anything.


368
0:15:28,69 --> 0:15:30,14
It's a mix.


369
0:15:30,14 --> 0:15:34,1
All the southern Mexicans-- we
all stick together, man.


370
0:15:34,1 --> 0:15:36,79
I got sent to this other
person called


371
0:15:36,79 --> 0:15:39,38
California Men's Colony.


372
0:15:39,38 --> 0:15:43,94
It's no good, meaning no good as
far as they hold snitches,


373
0:15:43,94 --> 0:15:46,76
rapists, child molesters.


374
0:15:46,76 --> 0:15:49,85
All of my friends told me,
hey, man, you know where


375
0:15:49,85 --> 0:15:50,625
you're going.


376
0:15:50,625 --> 0:15:52,38
You're going to have to get off
there and do your thing.


377
0:15:52,38 --> 0:15:57,15
You've got 72 hours to
handle your business.


378
0:15:57,15 --> 0:16:3,49
That means I have 72 hours to
crack someone, stab them, beat


379
0:16:3,49 --> 0:16:6,67
them up, or whatever
I'm going to do.


380
0:16:6,67 --> 0:16:8,91
FABIAN ALOMAR: I was mingling
and chopping it up and eating


381
0:16:8,91 --> 0:16:10,79
and hanging out with
a bunch of rapists.


382
0:16:10,79 --> 0:16:12,64
And I didn't do nothing.


383
0:16:12,64 --> 0:16:15,6
Nobody likes their kids
being touched by


384
0:16:15,6 --> 0:16:17,86
another human being--


385
0:16:17,86 --> 0:16:20,18
man or woman.


386
0:16:20,18 --> 0:16:24,53
So all these people deserved
to get cut, and I


387
0:16:24,53 --> 0:16:25,78
cut a couple of them.


388
0:16:25,78 --> 0:16:28,32



389
0:16:28,32 --> 0:16:29,485
FABIAN ALOMAR: Yeah,
a child molester.


390
0:16:29,485 --> 0:16:30,695
I hit him with a razor.


391
0:16:30,695 --> 0:16:33,62
They brought me the paperwork,
and I seen it.


392
0:16:33,62 --> 0:16:36,75
I knew the next day what
I had to do, which


393
0:16:36,75 --> 0:16:38,94
was Christmas Eve.


394
0:16:38,94 --> 0:16:40,61
I got added more time to me.


395
0:16:40,61 --> 0:16:44,52



396
0:16:44,52 --> 0:16:45,85
FABIAN ALOMAR: Yeah, he
survived, unfortunately.


397
0:16:45,85 --> 0:16:48,595



398
0:16:48,595 --> 0:16:49,17
He survived.


399
0:16:49,17 --> 0:16:51,45
-Well, but if he had died, you
would have been still in here.


400
0:16:51,45 --> 0:16:52,8
FABIAN ALOMAR: Oh, I would still
be-- there wouldn't be a


401
0:16:52,8 --> 0:16:55,58
story right now.


402
0:16:55,58 --> 0:16:58,5
There wouldn't be a good happy
ending to this story.


403
0:16:58,5 --> 0:17:1,97



404
0:17:1,97 --> 0:17:2,51
FABIAN ALOMAR: Oh, yeah.


405
0:17:2,51 --> 0:17:3,51
Yeah, I only told a few.


406
0:17:3,51 --> 0:17:4,55
I only told a couple.


407
0:17:4,55 --> 0:17:7,28
I would get pictures sent to
me from the internet--


408
0:17:7,28 --> 0:17:8,71
pictures of me skating
and stuff.


409
0:17:8,71 --> 0:17:10,704
And I told a couple
of my cellies.


410
0:17:10,704 --> 0:17:13,109
And they were like,
wow, that's you?


411
0:17:13,109 --> 0:17:16,8
Inside there, I used to make a
little full on skate park.


412
0:17:16,8 --> 0:17:19,839
I would get sent cards, or I'd
use old cards that my friends


413
0:17:19,839 --> 0:17:22,69
were trashing.


414
0:17:22,69 --> 0:17:24,3
They were going to discard
and get rid of stuff.


415
0:17:24,3 --> 0:17:30,88
So I'd set up and tape and use
Koolaid for glue, and I'd get


416
0:17:30,88 --> 0:17:33,755
pieces of tape that come in
letters, and I'd make a skate


417
0:17:33,755 --> 0:17:37,6
park-- like a ramp to
wall, pyramid ramp.


418
0:17:37,6 --> 0:17:41,57
I put together a little
mini ramp.


419
0:17:41,57 --> 0:17:44,82
The boards were hard to make.


420
0:17:44,82 --> 0:17:46,71
I used to pretend just
with my hands,


421
0:17:46,71 --> 0:17:49,83
just with my two fingers.


422
0:17:49,83 --> 0:17:51,46
It was always when I
go to sleep and lay


423
0:17:51,46 --> 0:17:53,31
down and knock out.


424
0:17:53,31 --> 0:17:55,79
I had so many crazy thoughts
of different things-- like


425
0:17:55,79 --> 0:17:57,59
man, what if I would
have done this?


426
0:17:57,59 --> 0:18:1,23
Where would I be if I just
continued skating and not got


427
0:18:1,23 --> 0:18:6,8
caught up in all this drugs and
all this crazy violence


428
0:18:6,8 --> 0:18:6,75
that I did?


429
0:18:6,75 --> 0:18:9,91
And I should've just stood
hanging out with this person,


430
0:18:9,91 --> 0:18:15,3
or I should have just continued
to skate and not--


431
0:18:15,3 --> 0:18:15,95
why did I-- you know?


432
0:18:15,95 --> 0:18:17,47
All the whys and what ifs.


433
0:18:17,47 --> 0:18:20,49



434
0:18:20,49 --> 0:18:24,28
You've just got to keep
going forward, dog.


435
0:18:24,28 --> 0:18:25,19
All those questions--


436
0:18:25,19 --> 0:18:27,62
if you could drive yourself
mad with that.


437
0:18:27,62 --> 0:18:32,72
The very same night I
got out, I went to


438
0:18:32,72 --> 0:18:35,96
Skatelab in Simi Valley.


439
0:18:35,96 --> 0:18:38,3
FABIAN ALOMAR: I went there just
to go, because when it


440
0:18:38,3 --> 0:18:39,83
first opened, I had
a board up there.


441
0:18:39,83 --> 0:18:42,41
I wanted to see if it was still
there or if they kicked


442
0:18:42,41 --> 0:18:43,55
it out or what.


443
0:18:43,55 --> 0:18:44,61
And it was there.


444
0:18:44,61 --> 0:18:48,56
I called up Jeron Wilson
and we talked.


445
0:18:48,56 --> 0:18:50,65
He was like, damn, good
to hear from you.


446
0:18:50,65 --> 0:18:51,3
I'm here.


447
0:18:51,3 --> 0:18:53,453
I'm here skating with
Guy and Costin.


448
0:18:53,453 --> 0:18:55,406
And I was like, what?


449
0:18:55,406 --> 0:18:57,46
Let me talk to Guy.


450
0:18:57,46 --> 0:18:59,61
Guy was like, dude, I'm going
to go get you and


451
0:18:59,61 --> 0:19:0,53
pick you up, man.


452
0:19:0,53 --> 0:19:2,11
Where you at?


453
0:19:2,11 --> 0:19:3,585
So he came.


454
0:19:3,585 --> 0:19:4,58
He picked me up.


455
0:19:4,58 --> 0:19:6,4
And we hung out.


456
0:19:6,4 --> 0:19:7,3
We used to always hang out.


457
0:19:7,3 --> 0:19:8,83
That's my best friend
right there.


458
0:19:8,83 --> 0:19:10,45
That's my boy.


459
0:19:10,45 --> 0:19:16,5
Once he scooped me up, I
embedded the idea of me


460
0:19:16,5 --> 0:19:16,85
skating again.


461
0:19:16,85 --> 0:19:19,81
And so he started taking
me around with him.


462
0:19:19,81 --> 0:19:21,96
And yeah, if anybody got
me back into it, I


463
0:19:21,96 --> 0:19:23,2
could say Guy did--


464
0:19:23,2 --> 0:19:28,83
back into the scene period And
I'm going to be honest with


465
0:19:28,83 --> 0:19:32,6
you, I didn't think
skateboarding was going to


466
0:19:32,6 --> 0:19:38,19
accept back again or have love
for me because of what I did.


467
0:19:38,19 --> 0:19:41,696
I got this board out SK8MAFIA.


468
0:19:41,696 --> 0:19:44,855
I'm about to put this shit
together tomorrow.


469
0:19:44,855 --> 0:19:47,1
STEVEN CALES: You've got to take
advantage of the things


470
0:19:47,1 --> 0:19:48,86
that skateboarding gives you.


471
0:19:48,86 --> 0:19:52,35
If you're getting paid and it's
paying your bills and you


472
0:19:52,35 --> 0:19:58,21
ain't got to work, then, man,
give skateboarding 115%.


473
0:19:58,21 --> 0:19:59,74
Just stick to skating, you
know what I'm saying?


474
0:19:59,74 --> 0:20:1,28
And stay out of jail.


475
0:20:1,28 --> 0:20:1,96
Stay free.


476
0:20:1,96 --> 0:20:3,95
Stay off of drugs.


477
0:20:3,95 --> 0:20:8,57
I did 32 months that one time,
and then I got out.


478
0:20:8,57 --> 0:20:13,95
20 days later, I
did 24 months.


479
0:20:13,95 --> 0:20:15,95
And then I had done 20 months.


480
0:20:15,95 --> 0:20:18,9
And then I had done a year.


481
0:20:18,9 --> 0:20:21,24
And then I had done six months,
which got broken down,


482
0:20:21,24 --> 0:20:23,75
so I did four months out
of that six months.


483
0:20:23,75 --> 0:20:27,43
Altogether, I say I did
about probably a cool


484
0:20:27,43 --> 0:20:31,58
nine years in jail.


485
0:20:31,58 --> 0:20:32,49
STEVEN CALES: Oh, yeah.


486
0:20:32,49 --> 0:20:33,67
Yeah.


487
0:20:33,67 --> 0:20:38,8
The freedom is so much better,
breathing fresh air.


488
0:20:38,8 --> 0:20:43,74
Fresh air to me is the city
buses, dirt, you know?


489
0:20:43,74 --> 0:20:45,24
Not in the mountains
somewhere.


490
0:20:45,24 --> 0:20:49,41
That's fresh air, but still, out
here, it's so much better.


491
0:20:49,41 --> 0:20:49,73
It's better.


492
0:20:49,73 --> 0:20:50,64
-This is your fresh air.


493
0:20:50,64 --> 0:20:52,57
STEVEN CALES: Yeah,
it's my fresh air.


494
0:20:52,57 --> 0:20:54,87
No matter how much money you
ain't got or how much money


495
0:20:54,87 --> 0:20:57,89
you got, freedom is
the best, man.


496
0:20:57,89 --> 0:20:59,32
Nothing is more better.


497
0:20:59,32 --> 0:21:0,87
It's priceless.


498
0:21:0,87 --> 0:21:2,1
Fabian is doing good, man.


499
0:21:2,1 --> 0:21:3,33
I'm proud of him.


500
0:21:3,33 --> 0:21:5,242
He's doing good.


501
0:21:5,242 --> 0:21:8,22
I'm not going to say he picked
up where he left off, but he's


502
0:21:8,22 --> 0:21:10,875
doing better than when he
left off, even when


503
0:21:10,875 --> 0:21:11,842
he was doing good.


504
0:21:11,842 --> 0:21:12,606
He's doing good.


505
0:21:12,606 --> 0:21:16,19
He's doing really good right
now, and I'm proud of him.


506
0:21:16,19 --> 0:21:19,79
FABIAN ALOMAR: I like
the struggle.


507
0:21:19,79 --> 0:21:23,44
It makes you want
to go for more.


508
0:21:23,44 --> 0:21:24,34
This acting--


509
0:21:24,34 --> 0:21:25,59
it's making me some money.


510
0:21:25,59 --> 0:21:28,61



511
0:21:28,61 --> 0:21:30,2
FABIAN ALOMAR: I'm working
with a few, man,


512
0:21:30,2 --> 0:21:35,392
like Mos Def on Dexter.


513
0:21:35,392 --> 0:21:36,72
-You were on Dexter?


514
0:21:36,72 --> 0:21:39,32
FABIAN ALOMAR: Yeah.


515
0:21:39,32 --> 0:21:45,53
It's not something that I
can say I'm getting rich


516
0:21:45,53 --> 0:21:46,34
right now from it.


517
0:21:46,34 --> 0:21:48,51
But I can see the yellow
brick road.


518
0:21:48,51 --> 0:21:49,5
I'm following it, you
know what I mean?


519
0:21:49,5 --> 0:21:52,95
And as long as I say on
this road, I'll be OK.


520
0:21:52,95 --> 0:21:57,53



521
0:21:57,53 --> 0:22:0,23
FABIAN ALOMAR: You know
what I do miss?


522
0:22:0,23 --> 0:22:3,87
I miss the good people that
I left behind in there.


523
0:22:3,87 --> 0:22:8,47
I left a lot of good people--
good, solid people that should


524
0:22:8,47 --> 0:22:10,34
have had another chance.


525
0:22:10,34 --> 0:22:11,59
They deserve one more chance.


526
0:22:11,59 --> 0:22:14,62



527
0:22:14,62 --> 0:22:17,46
But no, I don't miss
the place at all.


528
0:22:17,46 --> 0:22:18,71
Hell no.


529
0:22:18,71 --> 0:24:18,71
