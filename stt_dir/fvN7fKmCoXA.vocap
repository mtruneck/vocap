###24 RYAN: How are you?
###26 RYAN: [INAUDIBLE]
###28 
###41 MAN: Yeah.
###42 
###71 RYAN: So we first met Nims a few months ago.
###73 And after earning his trust for a little while, he agreed
###75 to let us hang out with him.
###77 But for really obvious reasons, a lot of the names
###79 and places that you see in this piece
###81 are going to be withheld.
###82 
###121 RYAN: So after about a half an hour of twists and turns down
###123 a whole bunch of streets we didn't recognize, we finally
###125 arrived Nims' apartment.
###128 The walls are mostly bare, and besides a bed and dresser and
###130 a big screen TV, it didn't look like anyone actually
###132 lived there.
###134 
###164 RYAN: Per week?
###165 
###201 NIMS: I could just do it myself.
###202 
###250 RYAN: At the age of 17, Nims was arrested with a felony
###252 weight of cocaine.
###254 Just months before his 18th birthday, he faced the
###257 possibility of a 20 year prison sentence.
###259 
###300 RYAN: Where did they send you?
###301 
###315 NIMS: It was three years in jail or
###317 take the SHOCK program.
###318 Do six months of kiss ass, suck dick too [INAUDIBLE].
###321 
###340 They punch you.
###341 They tell you when to eat.
###342 They tell you how to do everything.
###343 Probably worse than a military boot camp.
###346 
###357 I wound up doing four months.
###358 
###374 If you don't stop and think before you do, you're going to
###377 find yourself in trouble every fucking time you do something.

###513 NIMS: 4:50.
###588 You got to sacrifice.
###589 
###597 RYAN: Over the past few years, the volume of calls is Nims
###599 receives each day has grown exponentially.
###602 After months of working 12 to 15 hour shifts, seven days a
###605 week, and with numerous failed attempts, he eventually put
###608 together a reliable crew.
###610 After a quick call, he invited us back to the stash house to
###613 meet one of them.
###614 
###626 RYAN: When we arrived at Nims' stash house, we were surprised
###628 to find Mild.
###630 He was a crew member that we had met on a previous shoot,
###632 but we knew he had just been arrested.
###634 He told us all about how Nims had covered his bail, and even
###637 brought in his own very expensive lawyer to get Mild's
###639 sentence reduced to probation.
###640 
###655 [PHONE RINGING]
###671 RYAN: Even with the recent proposed [INAUDIBLE], general
###673 marijuana arrest, and an aggressive stop and frisk,
###676 program, it was really hard to believe that the volume of
###679 product that Nims was distributing each week could
###681 be produced locally, under the nose of the NYPD.
###683 
###697 NIMS: You've got your [INAUDIBLE] ounces.
###699 Then you've got your dimes.

###816 RYAN: Nims' father was a known contract killer, employed by
###818 one of the notorious five mafia families of New York.
###822 The number of unsolved murders
###823 associated with him is unknown.
###825 But it's more than you can count on one hand.
###826 
###849 RYAN: For Nims' protection, his father's name, and that of
###852 the organization he worked for, has been withheld.
###854 
###867 RYAN: Have you ever felt afraid for retribution for
###869 some of the things that your dad did?
###871 
###897 RYAN: But you would never take it as far as he did?
###901 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###929 RYAN: Things begin to intensify when Nims spotted a
###931 guy that he had fronted $2,400 to make a
###934 small scale drug purchase.
###935 
###970 RYAN: When it became apparent that the situation over the
###972 fronted money was prime to erupt into a full on beef
###974 between the two, Nims paused our conversation to give his
###977 partners a heads up.
###978 
###1033 NIMS: Yeah, fuck them niggas.
###1035 
###1050 I take care of my customers.
###1052 
###1089 She was diagnosed a couple months ago.
###1091 
###1119 50 years of smoking cigarettes finally caught up to her.
###1121 
###1127 It just gets worse and worse day by day.
###1129 
###1132 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1150 RYAN: What's the first thing you're going to
###1152 do when you're done?
###1153 
###1160 So what's better about this current girlfriend you got?
###1165 How is it different than the girls that you've dated since
###1167 you've been working?
###1169 
###1190 NIMS: She's a lot older than me.
###1192 But her mind frame is where my mind frame is.
###1194 
###1204 RYAN: You see a future in her?
