301
0:17:23,339 --> 0:17:27,1
as long as i said about


302
0:17:27,1 --> 0:17:28,79
however


303
0:17:28,79 --> 0:17:36,13
the guests have yet to confirm that
booking


304
0:17:36,13 --> 0:17:37,109
yes


305
0:17:37,109 --> 0:17:39,909
all things


306
0:17:39,909 --> 0:17:43,48
possibly travel travel plans changed


307
0:17:43,48 --> 0:17:45,74
visit london is a paris


308
0:17:45,74 --> 0:17:50,19
physically be the u_s_ or for the arts
maybe they thought they might go skiing


309
0:17:50,19 --> 0:17:52,92
they might go to the skiing resort


310
0:17:52,92 --> 0:17:55,24
you know the schedule itself


311
0:17:55,24 --> 0:17:58,919
peters lives are very very demanding and
very busy


312
0:17:58,919 --> 0:18:2,63
we we have to set them out of our top
tokens they probably have every


313
0:18:2,63 --> 0:18:7,51
intention to stay here on wednesday and
then the date changes team on strange


314
0:18:7,51 --> 0:18:8,98
different plane


315
0:18:8,98 --> 0:18:12,72
different demand for a different city
and they arrive from thursday or a week


316
0:18:12,72 --> 0:18:15,6
later on in the year we deal with it all
the time


317
0:18:15,6 --> 0:18:19,6
sold for one room that's of course
slightly different in comparison to a


318
0:18:19,6 --> 0:18:25,76
hotel


319
0:18:25,76 --> 0:18:30,58
it's taken two days to transform the
third floor into temp requirements


320
0:18:30,58 --> 0:18:40,93
still the booking has not been confirmed


321
0:18:40,93 --> 0:18:43,809
all is well


322
0:18:43,809 --> 0:19:3,39
related to the issue


323
0:19:3,39 --> 0:19:10,2
the royal family finally in my next two
days behind schedule


324
0:19:10,2 --> 0:19:13,9

327
0:19:20,65 --> 0:19:23,36
spoken to are heads in exchange


328
0:19:23,36 --> 0:19:27,45
so it's really not unusual for a ham


329
0:19:27,45 --> 0:19:33,67
form for me not to see certain death one
would think would want


330
0:19:33,67 --> 0:19:37,78
with more than eleven thousand five-star
luxury rooms in london


331
0:19:37,78 --> 0:19:41,66
claridge's faces stiff competition


332
0:19:41,66 --> 0:19:45,78
thomas names he needs to keep attracting
the likes of the guests currently


333
0:19:45,78 --> 0:19:48,52
occupying the third floor


334
0:19:48,52 --> 0:19:50,36
how can people understand


335
0:19:50,36 --> 0:19:51,97
how big a business


336
0:19:51,97 --> 0:19:55,74
para kisi it's the easiest or a relative
he know that all of course companies and


337
0:19:55,74 --> 0:20:0,41
corporations in this world that probably
and turned over more revenue with four


338
0:20:0,41 --> 0:20:3,799
hundred twenty people and then other
such hanover nestle carriages


339
0:20:3,799 --> 0:20:6,45
it's it's it's it's a fifty eight
million pounds


340
0:20:6,45 --> 0:20:8,26
business and and all of a


341
0:20:8,26 --> 0:20:9,23
times


342
0:20:9,23 --> 0:20:12,84
and that is as yet and is there


343
0:20:12,84 --> 0:20:17,15
on mute increase in revenue every year


344
0:20:17,15 --> 0:20:19,38
but yes again you can call the press or
you can


345
0:20:19,38 --> 0:20:22,84
you know i'm probably the one to ask for
more


346
0:20:22,84 --> 0:20:27,58
installed it's what you do to yourself
and uh... it it wouldn't be


347
0:20:27,58 --> 0:20:30,91
it wouldn't be a hefty budget if you
said like you know it was amazing what


348
0:20:30,91 --> 0:20:33,5

349

that's really the individuals say you
know why there's


459
0:26:36,18 --> 0:26:40,76
one man's ludicrous is another man's
normal so that's really individual thing


460
0:26:40,76 --> 0:26:43,32
you know called


461
0:26:43,32 --> 0:26:46,58

478
0:27:36,29 --> 0:27:40,549

most regular guests and i think i mean
for forty years in such a special state


829
0:49:20,39 --> 0:49:21,179
so


830
0:49:21,179 --> 0:49:23,159
they should be recognized and no one


831
0:49:23,159 --> 0:49:24,999

832
0:49:24,999 --> 0:49:26,75

foreign teachers for that or the like


839
0:49:42,839 --> 0:49:47,409
like a wheelchair in the citadel

841
0:49:52,819 --> 0:49:55,43
mexican i


842
0:49:55,43 --> 0:50:0,449
the royal suite he's been minute people
panicked for the malcolm's arrival


843
0:50:0,449 --> 0:50:5,769
detailed desperate filed document his
cabinet to returning guests outlying say


844
0:50:5,769 --> 0:50:10,67
every preference from how the big cement
dot and tight securities to where the


845
0:50:10,67 --> 0:50:13,769
fun each year is placed within the read


846
0:50:13,769 --> 0:50:16,699
possessive abt that picture csr


847
0:50:16,699 --> 0:50:27,269
setup of the seating courthouse smokes
and that's the top of her bedroom


848
0:50:27,269 --> 0:50:30,66
it has not had a different way of he's
making of the bed and then the white


849
0:50:30,66 --> 0:50:32,739
part of the family as well


850
0:50:32,739 --> 0:50:34,87
but they are like that at the show up
people


851
0:50:34,87 --> 0:50:37,869
did a lot of


852
0:50:37,869 --> 0:50:39,979
sheets


853
0:50:39,979 --> 0:50:41,349
yet


854
0:50:41,349 --> 0:50:44,509
back next to their windows for me is to
have


855
0:50:44,509 --> 0:50:46,699
and tell you learned on wall


856
0:50:46,699 --> 0:50:49,47
to see it's and blankets should or not
because


857
0:50:49,47 --> 0:50:53,639
and also some political contest at the
time is like a conduit


858
0:50:53,639 --> 0:50:57,419
but she's just on the top


859
0:50:57,419 --> 0:50:58,429
to just make sure that


860
0:50:58,429 --> 0:51:12,19
those pics


861
0:51:12,19 --> 0:51:16,559
because we don't have a great service


862
0:51:16,559 --> 0:51:18,29
effective listening


863
0:51:18,29 --> 0:51:23,879
twenty objections can really going to go
let's close it was a good


864
0:51:23,879 --> 0:51:26,439
competency


865
0:51:26,439 --> 0:51:27,509
just


866
0:51:27,509 --> 0:51:30,359
help


867
0:51:30,359 --> 0:51:33,419
he loves his sweet cost


868
0:51:33,419 --> 0:51:35,609
uh... to rent


869
0:51:35,609 --> 0:51:41,99
status three days five-and-a-half hours


870
0:51:41,99 --> 0:51:43,3
it is a lot of money but i think


871
0:51:43,3 --> 0:51:46,959
you can call easily spend ten thousand
pounds flying to new york


872
0:51:46,959 --> 0:51:51,199
for five or flight


873
0:51:51,199 --> 0:51:53,109
missile become very also


874
0:51:53,109 --> 0:51:54,83
it's a management tradition


875
0:51:54,83 --> 0:51:59,38
it on her rival leases malcolm has
handed in old set of keys to the doors


876
0:51:59,38 --> 0:52:0,969
encourages


877
0:52:0,969 --> 0:52:4,68
the checks and she knows the who tell
better than any of the staff


878
0:52:4,68 --> 0:52:8,729
and connect as on marine nights manager


879
0:52:8,729 --> 0:52:12,959
they're always in the same place and
they have to be in for a long time


880
0:52:12,959 --> 0:52:16,749
because this has been the general and
just ask for a new we meet aspect but


881
0:52:16,749 --> 0:52:19,989
for i think it will be more than fifty
years


882
0:52:19,989 --> 0:52:24,169
this year freaky thank you


883
0:52:24,169 --> 0:52:29,9
yes ameen missus mack was a fantastic
woman and says she has


884
0:52:29,9 --> 0:52:32,259
the grades i think she has a great
spirit and a great sense of humor so if


885
0:52:32,259 --> 0:52:37,259
you can actually see it twenty i when
she gets the ski says s they disappeared


886
0:52:37,259 --> 0:52:45,679

887
0:52:45,679 --> 0:52:47,639

mr mrs malcolm rhyme


889
0:52:56,619 --> 0:53:1,539
but he and let's just wait here for a
moment


890
0:53:1,539 --> 0:53:6,189
so i think i think we should take the
orchids away because that clashes with


891
0:53:6,189 --> 0:53:10,19
the police look it's it's not the same
so we can


892
0:53:10,19 --> 0:53:12,349
just maybe get some


893
0:53:12,349 --> 0:53:17,329
but what i've done nothing moro from
poland or more traditional flawless is


894
0:53:17,329 --> 0:53:18,409

0:53:42,449 --> 0:53:44,389

900
0:53:44,389 --> 0:53:48,799
excellence is not cross into the city


901
0:53:48,799 --> 0:53:51,109

little


902
0:53:51,109 --> 0:53:52,49

912
0:54:18,829 --> 0:54:21,459
become fresh from the kitchen


913
0:54:21,459 --> 0:54:22,38
one point


914
0:54:22,38 --> 0:54:27,169
