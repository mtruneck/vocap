1
0:0:10,6 --> 0:0:13,1
We are all connected;


2
0:0:13,1 --> 0:0:15,701
To each other, biologically


3
0:0:15,701 --> 0:0:18,601
To the earth, chemically


4
0:0:18,601 --> 0:0:20,801
To the rest of the universe atomically


5
0:0:20,801 --> 0:0:23,501
I think nature's imagination


6
0:0:23,501 --> 0:0:26,1
Is so much greater than man's


7
0:0:26,1 --> 0:0:31,1
She's never going to let us relax


8
0:0:31,1 --> 0:0:33,401
We live in an in-between universe


9
0:0:33,401 --> 0:0:35,801
Where things change all right


10
0:0:35,801 --> 0:0:38,201
But according to patterns, rules,


11
0:0:38,201 --> 0:0:40,901
Or as we call them, laws of nature


12
0:0:40,901 --> 0:0:44,1
I'm this guy standing on a planet


13
0:0:44,1 --> 0:0:47,1
Really I'm just a speck


14
0:0:47,1 --> 0:0:51,701
Compared with a star,
the planet is just another speck


15
0:0:51,701 --> 0:0:54,1
To think about all of this


16
0:0:54,1 --> 0:0:56,501
To think about the vast emptiness of space


17
0:0:56,501 --> 0:0:59,1
There's billions and billions of stars


18
0:0:59,1 --> 0:1:1,701
Billions and billions of specks


19
0:1:1,701 --> 0:1:7,1
The beauty of a living thing is not 
the atoms that go into it


20
0:1:7,1 --> 0:1:12,1
But the way those atoms are put together


21
0:1:12,1 --> 0:1:14,501
The cosmos is also within us


22
0:1:14,501 --> 0:1:17,0
We're made of star stuff


23
0:1:17,0 --> 0:1:22,101
We are a way for the cosmos to know itself


24
0:1:22,101 --> 0:1:24,801
Across the sea of space


25
0:1:24,801 --> 0:1:27,101
The stars are other suns


26
0:1:27,101 --> 0:1:30,201
We have traveled this way before


27
0:1:30,201 --> 0:1:32,801
And there is much to be learned


28
0:1:32,801 --> 0:1:34,701
We are all connected;


29
0:1:34,701 --> 0:1:37,401
To each other, biologically


30
0:1:37,401 --> 0:1:40,201
To the earth, chemically


31
0:1:40,201 --> 0:1:42,301
To the rest of the universe atomically


32
0:1:42,301 --> 0:1:44,801
I find it elevating and exhilarating


33
0:1:44,801 --> 0:1:47,401
To discover that we live in a universe


34
0:1:47,401 --> 0:1:50,201
Which permits the evolution of molecular machines


35
0:1:50,201 --> 0:2:2,7
As intricate and subtle as we


36
0:2:2,7 --> 0:2:6,401
I know that the molecules in my body are traceable


37
0:2:6,401 --> 0:2:8,101
To phenomena in the cosmos


38
0:2:8,101 --> 0:2:11,1
That makes me want to grab people in the street


39
0:2:11,1 --> 0:2:13,0
And say, have you heard this??


40
0:2:13,0 --> 0:2:18,1
The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it


41
0:2:18,1 --> 0:2:23,501
But the way those atoms are put together


42
0:2:23,501 --> 0:2:25,801
The cosmos is also within us


43
0:2:25,801 --> 0:2:28,501
We're made of star stuff


44
0:2:28,501 --> 0:2:44,201
We are a way for the cosmos to know itself


45
0:2:44,201 --> 0:2:46,501
There's this tremendous mess


46
0:2:46,501 --> 0:2:49,301
Of waves all over in space


47
0:2:49,301 --> 0:2:51,801
Which is the light bouncing around the room


48
0:2:51,801 --> 0:2:54,1
And going from one thing to the other


49
0:2:54,1 --> 0:2:59,1
And it's all really there


50
0:2:59,1 --> 0:3:1,801
But you gotta stop and think about it


51
0:3:1,801 --> 0:3:4,301
About the complexity to really get the pleasure


52
0:3:4,301 --> 0:3:10,101
And it's all really there


53
0:3:10,101 --> 0:3:14,501
The inconceivable nature of nature


54
0:3:14,501 --> 0:3:17,1
To think about all of this


55
0:3:17,1 --> 0:3:19,501
To think about the vast emptiness of space


56
0:3:19,501 --> 0:3:22,1
There's billions and billions of stars


57
0:3:22,1 --> 0:3:24,501
Billions and billions of specks


58
0:3:24,501 --> 0:3:29,501
The beauty of a living thing is not
the atoms that go into it


59
0:3:29,501 --> 0:3:35,1
But the way those atoms are put together


60
0:3:35,1 --> 0:3:37,501
The cosmos is also within us


61
0:3:37,501 --> 0:3:40,1
We're made of star stuff


62
0:3:40,1 --> 0:3:45,1
We are a way for the cosmos to know itself


63
0:3:45,1 --> 0:3:47,701
Across the sea of space


64
0:3:47,701 --> 0:3:49,701
The stars are other suns


65
0:3:49,701 --> 0:3:53,1
We have traveled this way before


66
0:3:53,1 --> 0:5:53,1
And there is much to be learned
