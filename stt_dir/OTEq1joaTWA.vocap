###0 A lot of people believe
###3 that the things I talk about
###7 had been talked about in the past.
###10 When I was a member of 'Technocracy'
###13 they said they had blueprints for the future.
###17 I never saw any. I asked to see them.
###21 The only blueprint they had was a rough [outline]
###24 on the continental hydrology, irrigation
###28 but no real detail on it.
###31 How the lift locks work on the canal or anything.
###37 I asked Scott how he felt about circular cities.
###41 He said "No, I believe in linear cities."
###45 And he did not question "Why circular cities?"
###50 He just told me that we're going to use linear cities:
###54 cities in a line.
###56 If you start here and you go through the whole city
###61 you have to go back to where you started from.
###64 In the circular arrangement, if you go around
###67 you come back to where you started. You don't need to go back
###71 and your car is there.
###73 In a circular plan, or distribution center
###78 there are areas marked:
###81 refrigeration, air conditioning, whatever it is; and you park your car
###85 adjacent to that, instead of just parking in a big parking lot.
###89 You have to then walk over to the shoe department
###92 or the eyeglass department.
###95 This way it's marked on the outside of the circle what's in there.
###98 So you park adjacent to that area.
###101 If more people use the food shopping area
###104 there's a larger parking area for that.
###107 But the only way to find out is:
###110 how many people a day go to the food area?
###113 What percentage go to the eyeglass area?
###117 So the parking areas are based on that, not Fresco's decision.
###124 What people have to understand
###127 is how statistics are gathered;
###130 how they're decided upon, and that's by the behavior of people.
###135 If most people go to the childrens' center
###138 that has the largest parking area.
###141 If, later on, the schools become more efficient
###144 they work with less students at a time.
###148 The optimum amount of students depends on their age.
###152 The older people get, the more they understand if they're exposed.
###156 But children... You take a lot of children
###160 and you talk to them like I'm talking to you
###164 and you get feedback from the children.
###167 The kind of feedback you get from the children
###170 determines how many children you can effectively change
###174 within the given time.
###176 If you find out that you should have no more than 15 kids at a time
###182 depending on how sophisticated the subject is
###185 you have to try it and find out how it works.
###188 And then when you write your conclusions
###191 you say "In the system that I use
###195 a certain number of children seem to learn faster.
###198 I haven't tried 17 different systems yet.
###202 There may be other conclusions. We welcome them."
###207 (Roxanne) To me, to summarize this, it's saying
###209 "Why don't you give your technology away today?"
###213 I'm giving you everything I think they need
###217 to make this jump.
###220 Now they ask "Why don't you give your ideas away
###224 and make them available? After all
###227 what you're trying to do is make the world a better place;
###230 so if you choose, just give your ideas away."
###233 If I design a round city
###235 and I gave it away, it'll be a commercial city.
###239 You couldn't move in unless you pay so much a week.
###243 See, like there's so many dentists in that city
###247 so many barbers not a whole bunch of barbers
###251 the amount of barbers needed to take care of that city.
###255 But they will rent it out at a high price
###258 because opening a restaurant in that city is a sure thing
###262 because there's 5,000 people. Do you understand?
###266 So it becomes commercial and damaged.
###269 They say "Well, what about the good that it does?"
###273 Well, let's take a helicopter. It could be used as an ambulance
###277 or for machine-gunning people.
###280 Most helicopters are used for military purposes;
###283 machine-gunning people.
###285 The laser beam can be used to diminish the effects of
###289 optical disorders.
###292 I mean, ophthalmology.
###295 Lasers can be used in surgery.
###299 They can also be connected to weapons.
###302 If the laser beam is on the person, the bullets come out.
###306 We have no evidence to support ideas
###310 that were put out there for free.
###313 And there are people who say "Well, Fresco really doesn't believe in
###317 having his name put out there."
###320 I do when it comes to a book that I wrote.
###323 If people ask me questions, I can answer them.
###326 But if another guy copies my book
###329 word for word and
###333 he gets a credit for that;
###335 and people ask him "What do you do about this or about that?"
###339 They don't have that kind of background. They can't answer questions.
###344 But if you check with history, not Fresco
###347 you'll find that Louis Pasteur
###350 recommended vaccination. It never was a team of scientists.
###356 You find that the Wright brothers
###358 really developed the first powered flying machine.
###362 So you can go and write to the Wright brothers and say
###364 "How do you make your propeller?
###367 How much pitch does it have? " Only they know because they made it.
###372 You have to go to Edison, saying
###375 "How do you know how much of a vacuum to put in a glass lamp?
###379 How do you decide the elements you use?"
###382 You have to have to go to Edison. The gas company can't tell you that.
###386 When I was a kid there were people who went around the streets
###389 lighting the gas lamps that were all along the street.
###393 He was a lighter, with a long pole, and he lit those lamps.
###398 Then, when Edison's system came out
###401 he had to instruct people as to how it worked.
###405 When Tesla invented the Tesla Coil, he had to instruct people.
###411 But if another guy lifted it
###413 and he says "What's the resistance of the wires in that?"
###417 They didn't know, only Tesla knew.
###421 So it seems that in history
###423 Einstein's theory of relativity
###427 Pasteur, Darwin's theory of evolution
###431 as against a religious concept.
###434 Is it perfect? No. But it's a hell of a lot greater.
###439 And Darwin spent many years
###441 trying to put this stuff together.
###444 I'm not against teaching people physics and science. That's fine.
###448 That's the elements for putting things together.
###452 The books that I read by other people
###455 did not have all the answers. Semantics never touched the social system.
###460 Jacques Loeb informed us
###463 a great deal about plant tropism, geotropism
###468 all these things that we knew little about
###471 but Jacques Loeb was associated with it.
###474 So when you have the nuclear program
###477 to develop the atom bomb, there were always people in charge
###483 like Oppenheimer; he was in charge of nuclear research.
###488 Einstein's formula helped in nuclear research.
###493 There were many lead scientists that directed that.
###498 When you went to Germany, you'd find Wernher Von Braun
###502 as head of rocketry.
###504 Why was he head? Because others didn't experiment.
###508 He experimented before it became necessary to build rockets.
###513 He belonged to a young German group
###516 in which they experimented with rockets.
###519 When Hitler got in, Hitler backed him.
###522 But Wernher Von Braun had to educate
###526 all the scientists that knew nothing about rockets.
###530 Where did he get the ideas from? Dirty, hard work, with no financing.
###536 There was an American scientist named Goddard
###539 who spent his own money on rocket development
###542 and he was able to get rockets to go up a mile high
###546 and people thought he was a dreamer.
###549 And he said "If I talked about rockets in the scientific community
###555 I was looked upon as a foolish person
###559 who was not practical. " Do you understand?
###562 Are scientists the prime judge of things?
###566 No, they're not. You have to ask Goddard
###569 "How do you make your fuel combust?"
###572 In other words, when you launch a rocket
###574 with, say, 20 pounds of propellant
###579 you're lifting that 20 pounds of propellant up there.
###583 So the theory of rockets is to burn all the fuel you can
###588 and get the most propulsion, so you're not lifting up the fuel, too.
###593 If you fill to your car with gasoline to get to California
###597 you're not going to get as many miles by filling it as you go.
###601 Otherwise, you're carrying the gasoline with you.
###603 Somebody who found that out, we should know who he is
###607 so we could question him. But
###611 what happens is, it appears, that
###615 some members of The Zeitgeist Movement
###618 and The Venus Project think that Fresco
###622 picked up all these ideas from books. No, he didn't.
###625 He worked his ass off, compiling bits of information
###629 and taking out the inconsistencies.
###632 Now, people come along and they say (like some people do)
###636 they quote all the different things of The Venus Project
###640 and do not quote the source.
###643 So they get the applause, and they get the approval
###647 but they've done nothing to arrive at these ideas
###650 and then they tell me to give out ideas.
###654 Did they give out ideas? Did they make any contributions?
###657 Did they sponsor me in the 40 years of work?
###662 I had to pay for that myself, just like Goddard had to pay for it.
###666 If they finance the books and publishing, sure I'd give them away.
###670 It belongs to the public domain
###673 but we don't live in that kind of a world now.
###676 So laser beams are used on machine guns.
###679 When the beam is on the person, or on the airplane, the bullets come out.
###683 When it's not, they don't come out. Somebody developed that.
###688 And the reason they took a patent out on it is because other people
###690 would take patent on it, if they talked to them about it.
###694 And they would not get paid for their research.
###697 It may take 10 years to develop a laser.
###701 If you develop a laser and give it to people
###704 you don't know what they're going to do with it.
###707 You have no guarantee, and the guy that invents it
###710 doesn't care what they do with it, as long as he gets paid for it.
###713 People don't care if Hitler used helicopters
###716 to bomb cities or as ambulances.
###719 I prefer that they be used for ambulances
###722 or for surveying, aerial surveyors of farm equipment
###725 and diseased plants.
###729 It isn't so much the knowledge that science offers
###732 it's how it's used.
###736 A lot of people get mad at technology
###738 but it's not the technology they're really mad at.
###741 They don't know what they're mad at. What they're mad at
###744 is the abuse and misuse of technology.
###748 So if I put the ideas out there, and people sign an agreement
###753 that those ideas will not be used for weapons
###756 and they'll not be put in the public domain
###759 only amongst those that are building The Venus Project;
###764 otherwise, it will go off in different directions.
###767 So, the invention of the airplane
###771 is a wonderful thing. It could be used to move passengers faster
###775 from one area to another.
###778 But they can also be used to carry bombs.
###781 Their use depends on the leadership of the country.
###785 I don't know the leadership
###787 that would pick up ideas that you just put out there.
###790 Would they be used for the public good?
###793 The doctor that told other doctors to wash their hands
###796 before they did surgery
###799 due to childbirth fever
###801 he was kicked out of the hospital
###804 because other doctors knew that they couldn't see germs
###807 and they thought it was a theory.
###810 The guy that found germs was a millinery man.
###813 He worked with fabric and he noticed germs under a microscope.
###817 It wasn't a scientist who found germs, but the man's name
###822 is out there, in all the books on where the microscope came from.
###827 If you don't know where the microscope came from
###830 you don't know which questions to ask.
###832 The guy that invented the microscope would be asked
###834 "How did you think of it? Where did you get the idea?"
###837 Well, the public doesn't know that. If you get up and say
###841 "There are wonderful instruments, x-ray machines.
###843 We don't need to cut the body open. We can use fiber optics.
###848 Light pipes to see cancer..."
###852 But if you give it to people, they don't use it appropriately.
###856 They use it for profit. If you don't understand that
###860 look at the earnings today of the large corporations
###865 that work for profit. They don't work for the betterment of humanity.
###870 Doctors are supposed to take care of people.
###873 That's part of the oath, as you become a doctor.
###876 But if you can't afford certain things, you don't get it.
###880 I'm talking of socialized medicine
###883 or making medical procedures available to everyone.
###889 The doctor says "How am I going to make a living
###892 if I make it available? " He's trapped in this system!
###895 He has to charge [money] because he has to pay for things.
###899 The doctor has to pay for all the electronic equipment
###902 he uses in his office.
###906 Hospitals have to buy materials
###910 and they have to pay a contractor to put up a building.
###913 They don't put a building where the guy's going to treat people.
###917 So, they put up a building, then they think of all the staff working there
###922 and the people that invested in putting up the building:
###925 there are people that invest, and they put up the money for a return
###930 on their investment. You've got to understand
###933 that that is a predatory system
###936 where everybody makes money on any human disorder.
