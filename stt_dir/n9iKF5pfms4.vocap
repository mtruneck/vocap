###17 REPORTER: Some days are just unforgettable.
###19 The birth of a child.
###20 Your first day at school.
###21 The day you fell in the giant sinkhole.
###23 Well, at least that last part is the reality for one woman
###26 in Plant City.
###27 
###40 CARLA CHAPMAN: It compresses you.
###43 It's hard to-- you can't maneuver out of it.
###46 You're wiggling and you're maneuvering more into it.
###49 
###55 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: So we're here in Central Florida to
###57 investigate the problem of massive sinkholes being caused
###60 by groundwater pumping.
###61 Basically, to get fresh water, they've caused all the porous
###64 limestone underneath central Florida to start to cave in
###67 and crack, causing homes, neighborhoods, cars to start
###70 falling into giant holes.
###72 So we're going to get to the bottom of that story and find
###74 out if there are any possible solutions.
###77 
###90 Ah.
###91 Holy shit it's cold.
###93 
###101 Sinkholes are the result of groundwater pumping, the
###103 process we use to retrieve 80 billion gallons
###106 of water every day.
###107 The process is simple.
###109 Water falls from the sky and sinks down through the ground
###112 to fill aquifers, which are like massive underground
###114 vaults of water.
###115 By drilling into these aquifers, we can pump
###118 freshwater out.
###119 It's cheap and, in theory, a renewable source of drinking
###122 water for this country.
###124 More than half of our water is already produced this way.
###126 Problem is we're using too much of it too fast.
###129 We're draining aquifers faster than they can be replenished,
###132 and it's compromising not only wetlands, lakes, and rivers,
###135 but the structural integrity of Florida's limestone
###138 foundation.
###139 In Florida, where 90 percent of the population relies on
###142 groundwater for drinking, it's no surprise that sinkholes
###145 swallow up new terrain every day.
###147 
###154 So we're right outside of Gainesville.
###156 And this house right here has a huge
###158 fucking hole in its backyard.
###161 Looks like it's about 80 yards across, maybe
###165 30, 40 yards deep.
###167 Just a fucking massive hole in the center of the earth.
###170 We spoke to some of the neighbors.
###172 No one wanted to appear on camera, but they did know the
###175 people who lived here.
###176 And it happened in the middle of the night.
###178 They said it sounded like thunder and then suddenly went
###181 outside to find their backyard had caved in.
###186 EMMA KNIGHT: The Floridan aquifer, this is where we have
###188 all the water that's underneath us.
###190 It's kind of like a bank account, where you have a
###191 certain amount of money and you have bills that need to be
###194 paid every month.
###196 And those could be the springs and the rivers, that could be
###198 the uptake that used for plants or trees.
###201 So you have withdrawals from your account, direct
###203 withdrawals, which would be people watering their lawns,
###206 washing their cars, cooling towers from a power plant.
###209 And then there the deposits.
###210 And deposits are almost exclusively from rainfall.
###214 And it's just the percentage of rainfall that manages to
###216 percolate down to get right back into the system.
###218 Right now, we happen to be in a drought and we happen to
###221 have the highest amount of consumptive use
###223 that we've ever had.
###225 And there isn't enough water.
###228 
###231 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: So we're trying to reach the family who
###232 lived here previously, , but nobody has gone back to us.
###236 It's super terrifying to know that we're in a neighborhood
###240 where there's a bunch of families and literally, at any
###244 point, shit like this can just open up.
###248 [TED CORELESS]
###248 If you've got a home with a 36 foot hole in the front yard,
###253 under the current definition of what constitutes a
###255 sinkhole, that's not covered.
###256 Because it didn't affect the house.
###259 Now forget about the fact it completely destroys the value
###261 of the home.
###262 The idea was introduced and then ultimately adopted in to
###265 law that required all property insurers who sell insurance in
###269 the state of Florida to provide sinkhole coverage.
###272 When the claims got to an unacceptable level for the
###274 insurance industry, because they felt they were losing
###277 money over that, there was a real legislative push to try
###281 and address the issue by discouraging claims.
###285 I mean, you can see the amount of control that they're
###287 exercising over property rights of people by being able
###291 to change the definition of what constitutes a sinkhole.
###295 JILL HEINERTH: In Florida, we're also over permitting.
###298 We're giving permits for withdrawals of water, water
###302 that we simply don't have.
###304 So permits are being offered to very large industrial
###308 operations, mining, or agriculture in some cases.
###313 It's too much.
###314 We don't have that much water to offer.
###316 And because of that, that's why I see the flow declining
###319 in the springs and slowing down over time.
###324 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: So if groundwater pumping empties
###325 our aquifers and costs homeowners billions in
###328 sinkhole damages, why do we still do it?
###331 Because it's cheap.
###333 With population levels skyrocketing, especially in
###335 Florida, the supply authorities in charge of
###338 drinking water for Tampa Bay and Saint Petersburg have to
###341 find a way to keep the taps flowing.
###343 Tampa Bay water has increased groundwater pumping by 400%
###347 since 1960, extracting 4.2 billion gallons of water each
###352 day from the Floridan aquifer just to keep up.
###355 The first to pay for all this pumping, of course, is the
###357 environment.
###359 Florida springs have been up and rivers are soon
###361 predicted to follow.
###364 JILL HEINERTH: I've seen the quantity of water
###366 disappearing.
###367 I've seen the lifeblood of the planet slow down.
###370 There's less flow coming out of these springs.
###373 And I've seen a continued degrading of the quality of
###377 the water and the springs and rivers.
###380 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: As more and more sinkholes opened up,
###382 Tampa Bay Water was hit with a number of lawsuits from
###385 property owners whose wells had been over-pumped.
###387 They decided to try their hand at making ocean water
###390 drinkable, so they proposed the largest desalination plant
###393 in the Western Hemisphere, a notoriously expensive solution
###396 Tampa's citizens weren't exactly stoked about.
###399 Despite the amount of energy required, the Tampa Bay
###402 desalination plant was eventually approved and today
###405 provides around 10% of the region's drinking water.
###408 
###412 CHUCK CARDEN: 15 years ago this region was
###413 suffering some drought.
###415 Looking for water sources other than groundwater, this
###417 was an alternative that we chose.
###420 There was a bunch of projects we call alternative sources
###423 that were looked at.
###424 River waters, building reservoirs, building a
###427 desalinization plant.
###427 We had engineers study it and found out it was
###431 possible with the cost.
###433 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: And this was the most cost effective?
###435 CHUCK CARDEN: It wasn't the most cost effective, but it
###436 was most drought-proof.
###439 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: Can you give us information on how
###440 much money it takes to keep a place like running?
###444 CHUCK CARDEN: I will use the rule of thumb.
###445 The plant is a 25 million gallons a day plant.
###447 To run it, 25 million gallons a day, on a 365 days, it would
###452 be about $20 million in operations.
###455 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: So why, in particular, is
###457 this the most expensive?
###458 CHUCK CARDEN: It's all because of the power and to some
###460 degree the chemicals.
###461 But the power is close to 50% of the operating cost.
###465 Just to keep the lights and the pumps running, there's a
###467 lot of horsepower.
###469 It is more expensive than any other sources, and it's more
###472 complicated than treating groundwater.
###474 But when it gets down to you don't have any water, it's a
###477 very viable solution.
###478 You need to go to the hospital and the only vehicle you have
###481 is an SUV, you'll get in that SUV.
###483 And it's the best way to get in there.
###485 JILL HEINERTH: The bottom line with drinking water is that
###487 when you use groundwater--
###489 Let's just say it costs a penny.
###492 If you start withdrawing water from a surface water body, a
###495 lake, a river, and have to clean that deliver it to the
###498 public, that costs $0.10.
###500 If you have to desalinate the same quantity of water, it
###504 costs a dollar.
###506 EMMA KNIGHT: There's springs that are drying up all over
###508 the state of Florida.
###509 Flow is down at all of the springs.
###512 What do we have to do to keep everything from falling apart?
###518 [MUSIC- STEPHEN FOSTER, "OLD FOLKS AT HOME"
###520 EMERSON ROSENTHAL: The unfortunate reality is that
###521 we're already feeling the pressures of a freshwater
###523 shortage in Florida.
###525 Houses are falling into sinkholes, springs are drying
###528 up, and homeowners will continue getting screwed by
###531 insurance companies, unless someone's
###532 able to find a solution.
###534 The question really is whether or not Florida will be able to
###537 pull itself together before everybody ends up sitting in
###540 the sinkholes in their backyards, drinking
###542 desalinated ocean water out of Dixie cups.
###544 
###561 MALE SPEAKER 1: No one has a right to the water.
###563 MALE SPEAKER 2: It's always been somebody
###564 trying to steal or water.
###566 Don't take my water.
###567 I depend on it for my livelihood.
###570 MALE SPEAKER 3: It's the north versus south.
###572 It's the war of water in California.
###574 It's been going on since the Gold Rush.
###576 And it's continuing to this day.
