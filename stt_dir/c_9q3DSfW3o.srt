0:0:19,2 --> 0:0:21,75
Life is just unreal, just
the way it works.


3
0:0:21,75 --> 0:0:24,435
That's exactly what I'm thinking
about every time I


4
0:0:24,435 --> 0:0:25,685
cut something open.


5
0:0:25,685 --> 0:0:30,78



6
0:0:30,78 --> 0:0:36,8
When I start taking stuff out,
I look at the inner workings.


7
0:0:36,8 --> 0:0:39,2
And I'm just amazed by it.


8
0:0:39,2 --> 0:0:40,565
I think it's so beautiful.


9
0:0:40,565 --> 0:0:44,37



10
0:0:44,37 --> 0:0:46,126
A carrot!


11
0:0:46,126 --> 0:0:47,452
A carrot?


12
0:0:47,452 --> 0:0:48,702
Ugh.

15
0:1:8,17 --> 0:1:11,145
Fashion and taxidermy were two
very separate things that I


16
0:1:11,145 --> 0:1:12,43
was really interested in.


17
0:1:12,43 --> 0:1:15,88



18
0:1:15,88 --> 0:1:18,825
The love of anatomy got me into
fashion, because I saw


19
0:1:18,825 --> 0:1:23,71
clothes as wearable sculptures
that people could wear to


20
0:1:23,71 --> 0:1:26,79
either express themselves or
turn into a different person.


21
0:1:26,79 --> 0:1:32,25



22
0:1:32,25 --> 0:1:34,195
This to me is what fashion is.


23
0:1:34,195 --> 0:1:35,29
It's not really trends.


24
0:1:35,29 --> 0:1:38,3
It's just more about crazy
self-expression and becoming


25
0:1:38,3 --> 0:1:39,33
who you want to be.


26
0:1:39,33 --> 0:1:44,56



27
0:1:44,56 --> 0:1:48,31
I think the first mouse that I
did that came out well, I was


28
0:1:48,31 --> 0:1:49,0
so excited.


29
0:1:49,0 --> 0:1:51,45
I was just, like, shit.


30
0:1:51,45 --> 0:1:53,17
I'm going to do this
so much more now.


31
0:1:53,17 --> 0:1:55,3
I'm going to fucking do it.


32
0:1:55,3 --> 0:1:56,28
I'm going to do it.


33
0:1:56,28 --> 0:1:59,65



34
0:1:59,65 --> 0:2:2,94
Whenever I go hiking, I've
always got a little cooler and


35
0:2:2,94 --> 0:2:6,14
Tupperware and Ziploc
bags and gloves.


36
0:2:6,14 --> 0:2:10,43
And more often than not I'll
find something on a hike.


37
0:2:10,43 --> 0:2:13,505
And then when it's the season
to trap, I'll go trapping.


38
0:2:13,505 --> 0:2:17,9



39
0:2:17,9 --> 0:2:21,765
So a friend called me, and told
me about a lot of pests


40
0:2:21,765 --> 0:2:26,84
that were on his property, and
just gave me the invitation to


41
0:2:26,84 --> 0:2:29,11
come up there and trap.


42
0:2:29,11 --> 0:2:33,31
We set the traps really early in
the morning, before all the


43
0:2:33,31 --> 0:2:34,56
animals wake up.


44
0:2:34,56 --> 0:2:37,174



45
0:2:37,174 --> 0:2:39,89
I always had this connection to
the outdoors and science,


46
0:2:39,89 --> 0:2:44,828
and always seen the two
as one and the same.


47
0:2:44,828 --> 0:2:46,88
We got something.


48
0:2:46,88 --> 0:2:49,29
I think it's actually even
better for women to hunt.


49
0:2:49,29 --> 0:2:50,42
Because I think--


50
0:2:50,42 --> 0:2:52,44
not to be stereotypical
or sexist--


51
0:2:52,44 --> 0:2:54,54
but I think women are
more intuitive.


52
0:2:54,54 --> 0:2:56,56
They're just a little quieter.


53
0:2:56,56 --> 0:2:59,7
So this guy is small, so
he'll fall right out.


54
0:2:59,7 --> 0:3:1,303
We have stuff to prove,
but there's kind


55
0:3:1,303 --> 0:3:2,36
of nothing to prove.


56
0:3:2,36 --> 0:3:2,73
Chippy.


57
0:3:2,73 --> 0:3:4,8
With guys it's like, I got
to prove that I can


58
0:3:4,8 --> 0:3:6,0
shoot this big gun.


59
0:3:6,0 --> 0:3:9,21
And I got to prove I can catch,
like, 45,000 minks this


60
0:3:9,21 --> 0:3:10,54
season, and all this stuff.


61
0:3:10,54 --> 0:3:14,15
Whereas a women would just be
like, I caught a chipmunk and


62
0:3:14,15 --> 0:3:17,35
I'm going to put a cherry in its
hands and make taxidermy


63
0:3:17,35 --> 0:3:18,6
out of it and just be happy.


64
0:3:18,6 --> 0:3:26,91



65
0:3:26,91 --> 0:3:28,89
I grew up in Miami, Florida.


66
0:3:28,89 --> 0:3:31,49
My parents were pretty
conservative.


67
0:3:31,49 --> 0:3:34,94
My mom was a biology teacher,
which had a huge influence on


68
0:3:34,94 --> 0:3:38,2
my love of nature, my
love of anatomy.


69
0:3:38,2 --> 0:3:39,91
My dad was an accountant.


70
0:3:39,91 --> 0:3:42,66
And I think he always wanted
me to be a doctor, or a


71
0:3:42,66 --> 0:3:43,61
lawyer, or something.


72
0:3:43,61 --> 0:3:45,64
And when he found out I wanted
to be artist, he was like,


73
0:3:45,64 --> 0:3:47,9
well you better be really
fucking good.


74
0:3:47,9 --> 0:3:50,955
Or else I'll have said
I told you so.


75
0:3:50,955 --> 0:3:54,7



76
0:3:54,7 --> 0:3:56,81
My family is pretty traditional
Hindu in that


77
0:3:56,81 --> 0:3:58,5
they're nonviolent.


78
0:3:58,5 --> 0:3:59,18
They don't hunt.


79
0:3:59,18 --> 0:4:0,55
They don't kill animals.


80
0:4:0,55 --> 0:4:1,8
And they're vegetarian.


81
0:4:1,8 --> 0:4:6,887



82
0:4:6,887 --> 0:4:9,352
Whoo!


83
0:4:9,352 --> 0:4:10,602
Fuck.


84
0:4:10,602 --> 0:4:17,76



85
0:4:17,76 --> 0:4:20,79
Oh, so we caught a woodchuck.


86
0:4:20,79 --> 0:4:20,459
He's dead.


87
0:4:20,459 --> 0:4:22,24
And he's going to turn
into a piece of art.


88
0:4:22,24 --> 0:4:24,9



89
0:4:24,9 --> 0:4:25,6
So pumped.


90
0:4:25,6 --> 0:4:27,65
Such an adrenaline rush.


91
0:4:27,65 --> 0:4:32,33
We have to go to the general
store and get a bigger cooler.


92
0:4:32,33 --> 0:4:34,49
Yeah, I'm OK with killing
something and eating it.


93
0:4:34,49 --> 0:4:36,77
And I'm actually feeling better
about killing something


94
0:4:36,77 --> 0:4:38,34
and making art out of
it and eating it.


95
0:4:38,34 --> 0:4:41,13
Because it seems so
much more natural.


96
0:4:41,13 --> 0:4:42,38
It seems so much more real.


97
0:4:42,38 --> 0:4:46,68
And it's super satisfying when
you finally do get to get your


98
0:4:46,68 --> 0:4:49,16
hands on something
and take it down.


99
0:4:49,16 --> 0:4:51,67
It's a huge accomplishment.


100
0:4:51,67 --> 0:4:55,28
So end of the trapping day, and
I got one big one, which


101
0:4:55,28 --> 0:4:58,29
is the biggest thing I'll
have mounted, ever.


102
0:4:58,29 --> 0:5:0,98
And one little one, which
is still pretty awesome,


103
0:5:0,98 --> 0:5:2,23
because he's cute.


104
0:5:2,23 --> 0:5:11,59



105
0:5:11,59 --> 0:5:14,535
What I'm going to do right now
is skin him, take his guts


106
0:5:14,535 --> 0:5:16,9
out, and all that.


107
0:5:16,9 --> 0:5:18,4
So what I'm going to do is just
make a cut right down the


108
0:5:18,4 --> 0:5:22,64
back, all the way down here,
and just take it apart.


109
0:5:22,64 --> 0:5:32,41



110
0:5:32,41 --> 0:5:34,44
I did a lot of dissection
in high school.


111
0:5:34,44 --> 0:5:38,39
And I was always the kid who
was so ready to dissect


112
0:5:38,39 --> 0:5:39,93
whatever it was.


113
0:5:39,93 --> 0:5:43,78
And this time was dissecting
a mouse.


114
0:5:43,78 --> 0:5:45,51
I had never dissected
a mouse before.


115
0:5:45,51 --> 0:5:49,62
I was always really curious
about their anatomy and stuff.


116
0:5:49,62 --> 0:5:51,7
Because you hear that
thing about, their


117
0:5:51,7 --> 0:5:52,5
bones are like rubber.


118
0:5:52,5 --> 0:5:53,8
They just squeeze
into whatever.


119
0:5:53,8 --> 0:5:55,69
And I read a bit about
taxidermy.


120
0:5:55,69 --> 0:5:56,65
I got some books.


121
0:5:56,65 --> 0:5:59,54
And then got an X-acto knife
and some Borax, and


122
0:5:59,54 --> 0:6:1,2
just went at it.


123
0:6:1,2 --> 0:6:6,34
I cut this open and was so
amazed by its tiny bones, the


124
0:6:6,34 --> 0:6:8,125
little world inside its body.


125
0:6:8,125 --> 0:6:11,5
It's just fucking fantastic.


126
0:6:11,5 --> 0:6:13,162
He's heavy, oh my god.


127
0:6:13,162 --> 0:6:14,6
Putting him down.


128
0:6:14,6 --> 0:6:17,87
There's that tension and
excitement there.


129
0:6:17,87 --> 0:6:20,846
But then there's also the thing,
the feeling of, I've


130
0:6:20,846 --> 0:6:22,85
got to keep my hands steady
so I don't fuck this up.


131
0:6:22,85 --> 0:6:31,6



132
0:6:31,6 --> 0:6:33,33
It's deeply reflective when
you cut something open.


133
0:6:33,33 --> 0:6:35,54
You see all of its
inner workings.


134
0:6:35,54 --> 0:6:40,28
And every time I'm just amazed
by this anatomy, and seeing


135
0:6:40,28 --> 0:6:42,13
the structure of an animal.


136
0:6:42,13 --> 0:6:43,3
You're dealing with death.


137
0:6:43,3 --> 0:6:44,28
And death is not pretty.


138
0:6:44,28 --> 0:6:46,17
It's not fun.


139
0:6:46,17 --> 0:6:48,44
There's nothing really
light-hearted about it.


140
0:6:48,44 --> 0:6:54,68



141
0:6:54,68 --> 0:6:57,75
What it does is take something
that's ended, for whatever


142
0:6:57,75 --> 0:7:2,2
reason, and give it a second
life, give it a new


143
0:7:2,2 --> 0:7:3,19
way to enjoy it.


144
0:7:3,19 --> 0:7:5,716
I think it's a lot more healthy
if we remember it.


145
0:7:5,716 --> 0:7:8,225
Not to dwell on it, but to
remember and to memorialize,


146
0:7:8,225 --> 0:7:14,87
and to face the reality that is
that things and people and


147
0:7:14,87 --> 0:7:17,2
stuff dies.
