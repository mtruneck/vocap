THOMAS MORTON: Takanakuy is a
giant mass brawl that happens


15
0:0:42,67 --> 0:0:44,38
every year at Christmastime
in the Andes.


16
0:0:44,38 --> 0:0:46,75
And the basic idea of Takanakuy
is people build up


17
0:0:46,75 --> 0:0:48,12
their grievances all year.


18
0:0:48,12 --> 0:0:49,63
And then instead of
them getting in


19
0:0:49,63 --> 0:0:51,26
fights, they save it.


20
0:0:51,26 --> 0:0:53,135
And on Christmas, everybody
gets in a big


21
0:0:53,135 --> 0:0:53,77
fight, and that's it.


22
0:0:53,77 --> 0:0:57,44
It's like Yom Kippur
but bloodier.


23
0:0:57,44 --> 0:0:59,93
Takanakuy is exclusive to
the Andean province of


24
0:0:59,93 --> 0:1:1,3
Chumbivilcas.


25
0:1:1,3 --> 0:1:4,39
The province's capital, Santo
Tomas, is a murderous 10-hour


26
0:1:4,39 --> 0:1:6,84
drive through the mountains
from the nearest city.


27
0:1:6,84 --> 0:1:8,95
We've been driving
for eight hours.


28

The roads aren't, isn't
the autobahn.


29
0:1:12,71 --> 0:1:15,81
Altitude sickness is kind of
combining with your general


30
0:1:15,81 --> 0:1:18,38
car nausea in a fun way.


31
0:1:18,38 --> 0:1:21,5
A bit of car sickness and a sore
ass, however, seemed a


32
0:1:21,5 --> 0:1:23,33
small price to pay
to get to see an


33
0:1:23,33 --> 0:1:24,924

34
0:1:24,924 --> 0:1:29,5



35
0:1:29,5 --> 0:1:31,79
Chumbivilcas is sort of
Peru's North Dakota.


36
0:1:31,79 --> 0:1:34,37
It's pretty, filled with
Indians, and poor as the dirt


37

out of.


38
0:1:36,41 --> 0:1:38,75
Most guys here split town when
they hit 16 to work in the


39
0:1:38,75 --> 0:1:41,14
Andes' illegal gold
mining industry.


40
0:1:41,14 --> 0:1:42,48

42
0:1:44,73 --> 0:1:47,71
The indigenous population here
claims descent from the Chanka


43
0:1:47,71 --> 0:1:50,82

the Spanish when they invaded,


44
0:1:50,82 --> 0:1:52,56
but the Incas before them.


45
0:1:52,56 --> 0:1:54,535
The area is cut off from the
rest of the country.


46
0:1:54,535 --> 0:1:57,29
There's basically no police,
no military presence, no


47
0:1:57,29 --> 0:1:58,585

48
0:1:58,585 --> 0:2:0,9
All of which plays into the
local sense of defiance


49
0:2:0,9 --> 0:2:2,65
against authority.


50
0:2:2,65 --> 0:2:4,94
A lot of Chumbivilcans also
speak the native Quechua


51

which doesn't help so much

called huaylia.

THOMAS MORTON: Truthfully, as
far as makeshift justice


407
0:18:49,2 --> 0:18:52,41
systems go, Takanakuy's got a
lot going for it, especially


408
0:18:52,41 --> 0:18:53,99
compared to our courts.


409
0:18:53,99 --> 0:18:56,995
Their turnover rate for cases
is extraordinarily quick.

The results are immediate and
satisfying for the winners.

And if you've got a problem with
them, you can always go

back in the ring
for an appeal.

The rest of Peru may look down
on Takanakuy as a symptom of


414
0:19:6,75 --> 0:19:9,69
rural backwardness, but while
they're sitting in a lawyer's


415
0:19:9,69 --> 0:19:12,49
office filling out reams of
paperwork, the plaintiffs of


416
0:19:12,49 --> 0:19:14,24
Chumbivilcas already have
their arm around the


417
0:19:14,24 --> 0:19:16,41
defendant's shoulder
and are drowning


418
0:19:16,41 --> 0:19:18,22
their problems in beer--


419
0:19:18,22 --> 0:19:20,49
not a bad way to spend
a Christmas.
