0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:13,8



2
0:0:13,8 --> 0:0:16,818
EDDIE: Didn't nobody see that
I bonged it into the bowl.


3
0:0:16,818 --> 0:0:23,5



4
0:0:23,5 --> 0:0:23,42
EDDIE (NARRATING): What's up?


5
0:0:23,42 --> 0:0:26,6
It's your boy Eddie Huang--
chef, writer, human panda,


6
0:0:26,6 --> 0:0:29,38
Bang Bros connoisseur, and
I'm horny for more.


7
0:0:29,38 --> 0:0:30,6
EDDIE: We tripping, man.


8
0:0:30,6 --> 0:0:31,63
EDDIE (NARRATING): If I had to
explain "Fresh Off the Boat,"


9
0:0:31,63 --> 0:0:34,56
I'd say that it's a cultural
show told through the lens of


10
0:0:34,56 --> 0:0:38,22
food, putting on voices that
have long gone ignored.


11
0:0:38,22 --> 0:0:52,5
Fuck with the human panda, this
is "Fresh Off the Boat."


12
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:54,12
EDDIE (NARRATING): Today we're
headed to the Bay Area to hang


13
0:0:54,12 --> 0:0:56,37
with some barbers and the Rice
Paper Scissors crew.


14
0:0:56,37 --> 0:0:59,4
But first it's off to Oakland to
shoot some rabbits with the


15
0:0:59,4 --> 0:1:1,2
East Bay Rats.


16
0:1:1,2 --> 0:1:2,7
EDDIE: Let's shoot some guns.


17
0:1:2,7 --> 0:1:3,54
Let's kill some rabbits.


18
0:1:3,54 --> 0:1:4,38
Let's do this.


19
0:1:4,38 --> 0:1:4,53
TREVOR: Cool.


20
0:1:4,53 --> 0:1:5,22
Done.


21
0:1:5,22 --> 0:1:6,272
EDDIE: All right?


22
0:1:6,272 --> 0:1:22,76



23
0:1:22,76 --> 0:1:23,76
TREVOR: All right, let's
take a walk.


24
0:1:23,76 --> 0:1:27,22
You guys stay up here
and practice.


25
0:1:27,22 --> 0:1:27,87
EDDIE: So you--


26
0:1:27,87 --> 0:1:29,77
I mean, this is not
just a hobby.


27
0:1:29,77 --> 0:1:31,84
It's kind of a lifestyle
for you.


28
0:1:31,84 --> 0:1:34,54
Instead of going to market, you
by shells, you drive, you


29
0:1:34,54 --> 0:1:35,68
come out here and do it.


30
0:1:35,68 --> 0:1:35,93
TREVOR: Yeah.


31
0:1:35,93 --> 0:1:36,8
EDDIE: All the way.


32
0:1:36,8 --> 0:1:38,83
TREVOR: I eat a lot of
food out of here.


33
0:1:38,83 --> 0:1:41,4
I come up here every
Sunday to hunt.


34
0:1:41,4 --> 0:1:41,99
I started planting
fruit trees.


35
0:1:41,99 --> 0:1:44,43
And eventually I'll just
eat what's off of here.


36
0:1:44,43 --> 0:1:46,63
People that eat meat and aren't
willing to kill an


37
0:1:46,63 --> 0:1:47,89
animal are fucking pussies.


38
0:1:47,89 --> 0:1:49,14
And fuck them.


39
0:1:49,14 --> 0:1:52,1



40
0:1:52,1 --> 0:1:53,35
Bang bang.


41
0:1:53,35 --> 0:1:58,49



42
0:1:58,49 --> 0:2:0,3
EDDIE: Got him.


43
0:2:0,3 --> 0:2:1,5
How do we do this.


44
0:2:1,5 --> 0:2:2,64
How do we get these--?


45
0:2:2,64 --> 0:2:3,65
TREVOR: Hopefully we see
some rabbits down here.


46
0:2:3,65 --> 0:2:4,97
And we'll walk down
here and sneak in,


47
0:2:4,97 --> 0:2:6,232
and see what happens.


48
0:2:6,232 --> 0:2:12,9



49
0:2:12,9 --> 0:2:14,53
EDDIE: Should we stand somewhere
in particular?


50
0:2:14,53 --> 0:2:18,23



51
0:2:18,23 --> 0:2:21,72
Where is he?


52
0:2:21,72 --> 0:2:25,27
[RAPID SUCCESSION OF GUNSHOTS]


53
0:2:25,27 --> 0:2:27,16
Are those all your
friends up there?


54
0:2:27,16 --> 0:2:27,32
TREVOR: Yeah.


55
0:2:27,32 --> 0:2:28,785
EDDIE: They're all in the
bike gang and stuff?


56
0:2:28,785 --> 0:2:29,64
TREVOR: No, not at all.


57
0:2:29,64 --> 0:2:31,28
You'll meet the bike
club after this.


58
0:2:31,28 --> 0:2:33,13
What I was saying before is I've
been teaching all these


59
0:2:33,13 --> 0:2:37,3
hipster kids from the coffee
shops how to hunt and shoot.


60
0:2:37,3 --> 0:2:39,39
Trying to get the next
generation coming.


61
0:2:39,39 --> 0:2:41,19
And just the fact that
everybody's moving from the


62
0:2:41,19 --> 0:2:43,13
country to the city, it's
a whole nother movement.


63
0:2:43,13 --> 0:2:44,38
All these skills
are being lost.


64
0:2:44,38 --> 0:2:50,3



65
0:2:50,3 --> 0:2:53,605
Nobody younger than
us is hunting.


66
0:2:53,605 --> 0:2:54,9
Nobody's applying for
hunting licenses.


67
0:2:54,9 --> 0:2:57,38
And it's just the whole
thing's changing.


68
0:2:57,38 --> 0:2:58,34
People don't do it.


69
0:2:58,34 --> 0:2:58,89
That's the whole thing.


70
0:2:58,89 --> 0:3:1,21
Teach them gun safety now
and then they'll get it.


71
0:3:1,21 --> 0:3:2,96
EDDIE: I'm holding this
properly, right?


72
0:3:2,96 --> 0:3:3,26
TREVOR: You're good--


73
0:3:3,26 --> 0:3:3,69
EDDIE: On the back, yeah?


74
0:3:3,69 --> 0:3:4,88
TREVOR: As long as you don't
point it at me or anybody


75
0:3:4,88 --> 0:3:7,9
else, were happy.


76
0:3:7,9 --> 0:3:8,33
EDDIE: Just so the
viewers know.


77
0:3:8,33 --> 0:3:9,82
TREVOR: Kind of the
bottom line.


78
0:3:9,82 --> 0:3:12,786
EDDIE: Point it up and
away, down and away.


79
0:3:12,786 --> 0:3:13,262
Whoa.


80
0:3:13,262 --> 0:3:14,512
TREVOR: Ooh.


81
0:3:14,512 --> 0:3:16,9



82
0:3:16,9 --> 0:3:18,75
EDDIE: Yo, so do you
have, like, a stunt


83
0:3:18,75 --> 0:3:19,97
rabbit for this show?


84
0:3:19,97 --> 0:3:23,7
You know, one we could
let loose.


85
0:3:23,7 --> 0:3:25,44
TREVOR: I've got some rabbits
that I raise, and I wonder how


86
0:3:25,44 --> 0:3:26,8
they'll taste.


87
0:3:26,8 --> 0:3:26,56
EDDIE: Yeah?


88
0:3:26,56 --> 0:3:28,25
TREVOR: We could pull
it out and kill it.


89
0:3:28,25 --> 0:3:29,54
Billy, you wanna
kill a rabbit?


90
0:3:29,54 --> 0:3:30,8
With your hands?


91
0:3:30,8 --> 0:3:30,88
BILLY: Yeah.


92
0:3:30,88 --> 0:3:31,95
Want to grab one?


93
0:3:31,95 --> 0:3:33,66
TREVOR: You've got
to eat the heart.


94
0:3:33,66 --> 0:3:35,1
BILLY: I will.


95
0:3:35,1 --> 0:3:36,36
EDDIE: Which one are you
going to pull out?


96
0:3:36,36 --> 0:3:37,97
BILLY: This guy right here.


97
0:3:37,97 --> 0:3:38,46
EDDIE: OK, perfect.


98
0:3:38,46 --> 0:3:39,948
BILLY: Whitey.


99
0:3:39,948 --> 0:3:40,94
TREVOR: Whitey.


100
0:3:40,94 --> 0:3:41,1
[LAUGHS]


101
0:3:41,1 --> 0:3:42,41
We're going to kill Whitey.


102
0:3:42,41 --> 0:3:43,74
EDDIE: Kill Whitey.


103
0:3:43,74 --> 0:3:44,99
Kill Whitey!


104
0:3:44,99 --> 0:4:27,554



105
0:4:27,554 --> 0:4:29,55
I'm a man who--


106
0:4:29,55 --> 0:4:31,4
I have no problem
killing shrimp.


107
0:4:31,4 --> 0:4:32,603
I have no problem
killing a crab.


108
0:4:32,603 --> 0:4:34,232
I have no problem
killing a fish.


109
0:4:34,232 --> 0:4:37,15
I'll drop a live lobster in a
pot of boiling water and not


110
0:4:37,15 --> 0:4:38,8
think twice about it.


111
0:4:38,8 --> 0:4:40,86
But I have a moral
inconsistency.


112
0:4:40,86 --> 0:4:45,29
Because watching that rabbit die
under that dude's knee--


113
0:4:45,29 --> 0:4:49,23
And we knew for weeks that we
were going to come watch


114
0:4:49,23 --> 0:4:52,35
Trevor either shoot a wild
rabbit or slaughter a rabbit


115
0:4:52,35 --> 0:4:53,81
that he raised for slaughter.


116
0:4:53,81 --> 0:4:57,84
And still, our crew was not
emotionally prepared and did


117
0:4:57,84 --> 0:5:0,18
not know how they were
going to feel.


118
0:5:0,18 --> 0:5:0,89
Tough, right?


119
0:5:0,89 --> 0:5:1,92
MALE SPEAKER: I still want it.


120
0:5:1,92 --> 0:5:3,41
EDDIE: And now you don't
feel so tough.


121
0:5:3,41 --> 0:5:3,75
MALE SPEAKER: No.


122
0:5:3,75 --> 0:5:6,51
EDDIE: We're so cut off from
the process of slaughter.


123
0:5:6,51 --> 0:5:7,24
We're not reminded.


124
0:5:7,24 --> 0:5:9,73
We don't see the image
every day.


125
0:5:9,73 --> 0:5:13,12
This enables these companies
and these people, and even


126
0:5:13,12 --> 0:5:16,62
places like my restaurant to
sell you more animal protein


127
0:5:16,62 --> 0:5:19,78
than you would actually eat if
you were reminded and were


128
0:5:19,78 --> 0:5:23,5
conscious of what
had to go down.


129
0:5:23,5 --> 0:5:28,29
It'd be hard to sell as much
meat as people in America buy


130
0:5:28,29 --> 0:5:30,585
if there were someone playing a
video out front of a grocery


131
0:5:30,585 --> 0:5:34,21
store, like this is
what happened.


132
0:5:34,21 --> 0:5:35,8
It's not a game.


133
0:5:35,8 --> 0:5:39,9



134
0:5:39,9 --> 0:5:40,5
MALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Don't
worry about the fur.


135
0:5:40,5 --> 0:5:42,145
BILLY: Yeah, he just seemed
like dumbshit the


136
0:5:42,145 --> 0:5:42,85
whole time I was--


137
0:5:42,85 --> 0:5:44,736
MALE SPEAKER: Can I just shoot
shit still, or no?


138
0:5:44,736 --> 0:5:51,32



139
0:5:51,32 --> 0:5:51,83
EDDIE: What's up, Trevor?


140
0:5:51,83 --> 0:5:53,29
TREVOR: Hey, hey, man.


141
0:5:53,29 --> 0:5:55,25
EDDIE: How you guys going
to cook the rabbit?


142
0:5:55,25 --> 0:5:58,28
TREVOR: So she decided to bread
it, buttermilk it, and


143
0:5:58,28 --> 0:5:59,24
deep fry it.


144
0:5:59,24 --> 0:6:1,3
EDDIE: Nice.


145
0:6:1,3 --> 0:6:2,24
Is she from the South?


146
0:6:2,24 --> 0:6:4,0
Because I see this cast
iron skillet.


147
0:6:4,0 --> 0:6:5,17
TREVOR: No, she's
from New Jersey.


148
0:6:5,17 --> 0:6:8,312
But she's been working at a
Southern restaurant, so I


149
0:6:8,312 --> 0:6:10,196
think she's got her
technique down.


150
0:6:10,196 --> 0:6:12,17
Hell yeah.


151
0:6:12,17 --> 0:6:13,8
TREVOR'S GIRLFRIEND: Wild
rabbit is a little


152
0:6:13,8 --> 0:6:15,56
bit gamier, for sure.


153
0:6:15,56 --> 0:6:18,12
This is rabbit that we've been
raising and feeding in a cage,


154
0:6:18,12 --> 0:6:21,54
so there's a ton more meat
and a lot more fat on it.


155
0:6:21,54 --> 0:6:22,48
EDDIE: Try this.


156
0:6:22,48 --> 0:6:23,89
This looks good.


157
0:6:23,89 --> 0:6:25,3
A rabbit tender over here.


158
0:6:25,3 --> 0:6:28,7



159
0:6:28,7 --> 0:6:30,71
It's like a mix of chicken
and gator.


160
0:6:30,71 --> 0:6:31,96
TREVOR: Yeah.


161
0:6:31,96 --> 0:6:33,69



162
0:6:33,69 --> 0:6:35,14
Thank you very much
for the rabbit.


163
0:6:35,14 --> 0:6:36,8
It was delicious.


164
0:6:36,8 --> 0:6:37,81
You got skills with
that skillet.


165
0:6:37,81 --> 0:6:38,65
Thank you for having us.


166
0:6:38,65 --> 0:6:39,7
TREVOR: All right, man.


167
0:6:39,7 --> 0:6:39,35
Good stuff.


168
0:6:39,35 --> 0:6:40,31
Come by any time.


169
0:6:40,31 --> 0:6:41,466
EDDIE: Thank you so much
for that, man.


170
0:6:41,466 --> 0:6:42,716
We'll see you soon.


171
0:6:42,716 --> 0:6:49,16



172
0:6:49,16 --> 0:6:53,62
EDDIE (NARRATING): Every time
I eat meat now, I have to be


173
0:6:53,62 --> 0:6:57,24
conscious of the fact that I am
choosing to enable someone


174
0:6:57,24 --> 0:7:1,55
to kill an animal and create a
market demand for slaughter.


175
0:7:1,55 --> 0:7:4,45
And I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.


176
0:7:4,45 --> 0:7:6,93
You just have to be conscious
with the choice you make.


177
0:7:6,93 --> 0:7:10,59
Every time you eat meat, just
remember that bunny's head


178
0:7:10,59 --> 0:7:13,4
fucking falling off.


179
0:7:13,4 --> 0:7:14,2
You know?


180
0:7:14,2 --> 0:7:17,19
And if you can still eat,
more power to you, man.


181
0:7:17,19 --> 0:7:18,8
Do you.


182
0:7:18,8 --> 0:7:23,53
But I will try as long as I can
to keep that image in my


183
0:7:23,53 --> 0:7:25,79
mind, because I don't want
to be unconscious of


184
0:7:25,79 --> 0:7:28,52
what's going down.


185
0:7:28,52 --> 0:7:30,132
"Fresh Off the Boat"
with Eddie Huang.


186
0:7:30,132 --> 0:7:30,974
We out.


187
0:7:30,974 --> 0:7:31,82
FUBU.


188
0:7:31,82 --> 0:7:33,8
For us, by us food show, kid.


189
0:7:33,8 --> 0:7:35,5
A'ight?


190
0:7:35,5 --> 0:7:37,61



191
0:7:37,61 --> 0:7:39,6
EDDIE (NARRATING): Next up on
"Fresh Off the Boat," we're


192
0:7:39,6 --> 0:7:41,22
headed to San Francisco's
Mission District to grow


193
0:7:41,22 --> 0:7:43,74
cephalopods on the block with
the Rice Paper Scissors crew.


194
0:7:43,74 --> 0:7:46,62



195
0:7:46,62 --> 0:7:47,96
EDDIE: We need this
in Chinese school.


196
0:7:47,96 --> 0:7:48,83
You know, man?


197
0:7:48,83 --> 0:7:51,6
These Chinese kids don't use
their dicks till they're 40.


198
0:7:51,6 --> 0:9:51,6
[LAUGHTER]
