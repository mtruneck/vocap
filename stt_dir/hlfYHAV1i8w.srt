1
0:0:12,23 --> 0:0:18,232
We are at that time when a great transition takes place.


2
0:0:18,232 --> 0:0:23,799
The society, the way we know it now, is changing very rapidly.


3
0:0:23,799 --> 0:0:34,92
We have to go along with the change that is happening as oppose to fear it and resist it.


4
0:0:34,92 --> 0:0:40,46
We have all heard about 2012, it's doomsday, the world will end, mankind will end.


5
0:0:40,46 --> 0:0:42,976
Some people have got this idea that things will stop,


6
0:0:42,976 --> 0:0:48,731
things will end in a catastrophe, but actually none of the philosophy is saying that.


7
0:0:48,731 --> 0:0:53,252
The agenda seems to be trying to put a negative spin on it


8
0:0:53,252 --> 0:0:59,92
to radiate fear out on the planet as oppose to love.


9
0:0:59,92 --> 0:1:1,948
And love is the glue of the universe.


10
0:1:1,948 --> 0:1:8,44
The more one loves and finds unity in this world and harmony,


11
0:1:8,44 --> 0:1:12,791
the more the blessing will be when that time comes.


12
0:1:12,791 --> 0:1:15,488
When you get up in the morning, the sun will be shining,


13
0:1:15,488 --> 0:1:19,853
it will be just like another normal day.


14
0:1:19,853 --> 0:1:26,575
But what might happen, I feel, could be a great change in consciousness.


15
0:1:26,575 --> 0:1:32,369
A prophesied acceleration of both technology and consciousness is occurring right now


16
0:1:32,369 --> 0:1:39,186
which is right on time with what's been decoded from the Mayan information.


17
0:1:39,186 --> 0:1:45,473
All shall benefit, on different levels, even the unawakened will benefit,


18
0:1:45,473 --> 0:1:51,694
because that's how the universe elevates souls.


19
0:1:51,694 --> 0:1:54,207
What is getting ready to happen is a positive thing,


20
0:1:54,207 --> 0:1:58,65
it is a step forward in an evolution, it's an awakening in consciousness.


21
0:1:58,65 --> 0:2:2,209
If we have a good look at our solar system and how it works,


22
0:2:2,209 --> 0:2:8,673
the moon goes around the earth, the earth is rotating and orbiting the sun.


23
0:2:8,673 --> 0:2:13,37
Now, our sun in turn is orbiting Sirius.


24
0:2:13,37 --> 0:2:18,431
In the great orbit of our two suns, we have turned the corner from the dark ages.


25
0:2:18,431 --> 0:2:22,171
Now they are pulling towards each other, bringing us to a higher consciousness.


26
0:2:22,171 --> 0:2:26,251
So, we are really in just a great time in history to be living.


27
0:2:26,251 --> 0:2:27,933
It is just an amazing time.


28
0:2:27,933 --> 0:2:33,602
The great changes that we will see with our own eyes will be stupendous.


29
0:2:33,602 --> 0:2:41,51
The new world of love is coming.


30
0:2:41,51 --> 0:2:44,46
Life on earth is affected by many cycles,


31
0:2:44,46 --> 0:2:47,192
the light of the day


32
0:2:47,192 --> 0:2:49,51
and the dark of the night


33
0:2:49,51 --> 0:2:53,823
and our yearly cycle of the four seasons.


34
0:2:53,823 --> 0:2:59,749
The stars in the sky are linked to life on earth and greatly influence our existence.


35
0:2:59,749 --> 0:3:3,679
That, which is above, is the same as that, which is below.


36
0:3:3,679 --> 0:3:7,192
As above, so below.


37
0:3:7,192 --> 0:3:10,944
But what if there is a greater cycle that takes thousands of years,


38
0:3:10,944 --> 0:3:14,17
which influences human consciousness?


39
0:3:14,17 --> 0:3:18,906
According to many cultures, much like the seasons that are familiar to us,


40
0:3:18,906 --> 0:3:25,327
human kind undergoes a similar cycle in which consciousness expands and contracts.


41
0:3:25,327 --> 0:3:30,8
It results in great ages of enlightenment and dark ages of misery.


42
0:3:30,8 --> 0:3:34,381
Different cultures refer to this cycle by different names,


43
0:3:34,381 --> 0:3:37,965
including the Yuga Cycle or The Ages of Man.


44
0:3:37,965 --> 0:3:39,887
But one thing is certain,


45
0:3:39,887 --> 0:3:46,721
these cycles were known to almost every ancient culture throughout the globe.


46
0:3:46,721 --> 0:3:50,135
The Hindu Yuga Cycle consists of four ages;


47
0:3:50,135 --> 0:3:52,293
the Kali Yuga or the Dark Age,


48
0:3:52,293 --> 0:3:56,411
Dwapara Yuga, Treta Yuga


49
0:3:56,411 --> 0:3:59,371
and the Satya Yuga, the Golden Age.


50
0:3:59,371 --> 0:4:3,48
During the Golden Age, human consciousness is at its peak


51
0:4:3,48 --> 0:4:9,242
where unity is celebrated and life is lived in peace, love and harmony.


52
0:4:9,242 --> 0:4:15,496
In the Silver and Bronze Ages, our consciousness begins its descend to its lowest point,


53
0:4:15,496 --> 0:4:17,746
the Dark or Iron Age,


54
0:4:17,746 --> 0:4:24,665
in which suffering and ignorance is at its peak and humans are divided and at war.


55
0:4:24,665 --> 0:4:28,61
That is our current Age.


56
0:4:28,61 --> 0:4:33,322
Then the cycle makes its way up again to the Golden Age.


57
0:4:33,322 --> 0:4:39,404
These four Ages influence the rise and fall of civilizations across the globe.


58
0:4:39,404 --> 0:4:42,108
It is believed that we are at that time


59
0:4:42,108 --> 0:4:47,35
when the Dark Age is coming to an end and the Bronze Age begins.


60
0:4:47,35 --> 0:4:51,157
And the cross over it taking place during the galactic alignment


61
0:4:51,157 --> 0:4:55,651
on December 21st 2012.


62
0:4:55,651 --> 0:4:58,25
The mainstream media throughout the globe


63
0:4:58,25 --> 0:5:0,654
depicts this date as the end of the world


64
0:5:0,654 --> 0:5:5,495
in which catastrophic events will extinguish all life on Earth.


65
0:5:5,495 --> 0:5:9,485
The end of the world theory is based on the Mayan Long Count Calendar,


66
0:5:9,485 --> 0:5:14,518
which ends exactly on 21st December 2012.


67
0:5:14,518 --> 0:5:17,702
Although many claim that the Mayans have predicted the end of the world,


68
0:5:17,702 --> 0:5:20,751
there is no evidence to suggest so.


69
0:5:20,751 --> 0:5:23,821
The Mayan Calendar simply resets on this date,


70
0:5:23,821 --> 0:5:28,91
as one cycle ends and a new one begins.


71
0:5:28,91 --> 0:5:31,445
Many believe that the marker left by the Mayan's


72
0:5:31,445 --> 0:5:34,91
indicates a great change in consciousness


73
0:5:34,91 --> 0:5:39,744
as we leave the Zodiac Age of Pisces and enter the Age of Aquarius.


74
0:5:39,744 --> 0:5:43,982
The date has become the most anticipated day in history


75
0:5:43,982 --> 0:5:46,937
and while many are anticipating it with love,


76
0:5:46,937 --> 0:5:50,56
others anticipate it with fear.


77
0:5:50,56 --> 0:5:52,882
What were the ancients trying to tell us?


78
0:5:52,882 --> 0:5:54,893
Is it the end of the world?


79
0:5:54,893 --> 0:6:8,292
Or is it a time of great change in human consciousness?


80
0:6:8,292 --> 0:6:13,321
Man know thyself and you will know the universe and all its Gods.


81
0:6:13,321 --> 0:6:19,368
So when one understand that we are the microcosm of the macrocosm,


82
0:6:19,368 --> 0:6:23,95
the stars that go above and around in various different cycles


83
0:6:23,95 --> 0:6:29,335
then we understand the connection between us and the God.


84
0:6:29,335 --> 0:6:36,6
Individual people by themselves, groups, societies,


85
0:6:36,6 --> 0:6:41,682
the mood of the whole planet - can all be altered, can all be changed


86
0:6:41,682 --> 0:6:47,348
and the reason for that is because the planet, group's, societies


87
0:6:47,348 --> 0:6:49,61
aren't what they appear to be.


88
0:6:49,61 --> 0:6:53,334
They are just another level consciousness.


89
0:6:53,334 --> 0:6:55,798
We are all consciousness.


90
0:6:55,798 --> 0:7:2,46
If consciousness changes to a higher vibration, which I feel is happening at 2012,


91
0:7:2,46 --> 0:7:8,421
then the society, the way we know it now, will not be there anymore.


92
0:7:8,421 --> 0:7:12,991
The old has to go, the new has to come.


93
0:7:12,991 --> 0:7:15,936
Religious traditions are looking forward to this time,


94
0:7:15,936 --> 0:7:17,578
because they know that it will bring


95
0:7:17,578 --> 0:7:22,23
much peace and love and joy and wisdom to mankind.


96
0:7:22,23 --> 0:7:24,582
You become aware of what you really are,


97
0:7:24,582 --> 0:7:28,994
you become aware that you are one with God and that you are God.


98
0:7:28,994 --> 0:7:33,74
Individual little elements or atoms of that devine.


99
0:7:33,74 --> 0:7:36,99
And when one realizes the God within us,


100
0:7:36,99 --> 0:7:38,571
he can see the God within everyone.


101
0:7:38,571 --> 0:7:41,571
Just trust in love, everything else comes.


102
0:7:41,571 --> 0:7:47,697
The universe knows what we need and the solar system knows where its going.


103
0:7:47,697 --> 0:7:50,778
The sun is flying through the heaven taking us to new place,


104
0:7:50,778 --> 0:8:4,608
we can rest assure that we are in good hands.


105
0:8:4,608 --> 0:8:8,4
We have all heard about 2012, it's doomsday,


106
0:8:8,4 --> 0:8:10,583
the world will end, mankind will end,


107
0:8:10,583 --> 0:8:14,121
comets come down and who knows what.


108
0:8:14,121 --> 0:8:18,317
Some of the things to do with 2012 that are out there


109
0:8:18,317 --> 0:8:21,613
are quiet contrasting, aren't they?


110
0:8:21,613 --> 0:8:23,244
To say the least.


111
0:8:23,244 --> 0:8:29,301
People are looking forward to terrible things happening,


112
0:8:29,301 --> 0:8:33,66
there is a lot of fear out there.


113
0:8:33,66 --> 0:8:36,499
Some people have got this idea that things will stop,


114
0:8:36,499 --> 0:8:40,1
things will end in a catastrophe,


115
0:8:40,1 --> 0:8:44,9
but actually none of the philosophy is saying that.


116
0:8:44,9 --> 0:8:46,547
They are saying it's the beginning of something new.


117
0:8:46,547 --> 0:8:50,21
The negative things out there


118
0:8:50,21 --> 0:8:52,955
would probably be better of discarded.


119
0:8:52,955 --> 0:8:58,597
I think that the 21st of December will be an ordinary day in real terms,


120
0:8:58,597 --> 0:9:4,814
except we will all go "Phew" if we make it, okay.. now what?


121
0:9:4,814 --> 0:9:7,62
Oops, it's the 22nd.


122
0:9:7,62 --> 0:9:9,945
Is that the first day of something new?


123
0:9:9,945 --> 0:9:14,647
Or is this a gradual process that's actually been happening?


124
0:9:14,647 --> 0:9:19,103
Well, December the 21st date is one that we don't have to


125
0:9:19,103 --> 0:9:21,842
get ourselves tight up in a knot about,


126
0:9:21,842 --> 0:9:28,75
some of the Mayan information is saying it's actually a window of time


127
0:9:28,75 --> 0:9:33,671
and it started maybe 2007 and is extending out to 2015.


128
0:9:33,671 --> 0:9:37,34
And the clock struck one and everything was sorted,


129
0:9:37,34 --> 0:9:39,41
its never ever going to happen.


130
0:9:39,41 --> 0:9:43,441
It's a gradual gradual process, it cannot possible happen,


131
0:9:43,441 --> 0:9:49,226
suddenly I ate this cookie and all of a sudden "Wow, it all happened."


132
0:9:49,226 --> 0:9:50,42
It's just nonsense.


133
0:9:50,42 --> 0:9:52,794
You won't get anyone to touch someone on the head


134
0:9:52,794 --> 0:9:55,885
and everything will be completely clear.


135
0:9:55,885 --> 0:9:57,929
None of these things are going to take place,


136
0:9:57,929 --> 0:10:1,141
it's going to be an ordinary day, that's what I suspect.


137
0:10:1,141 --> 0:10:8,828
On 21 December 2012, when you get up in the morning,


138
0:10:8,828 --> 0:10:14,642
the sun will be shining or it's cloudy... whatever, and nothing has changed.


139
0:10:14,642 --> 0:10:20,722
It is just another day and you will think 'Where was all this doomsday talk,


140
0:10:20,722 --> 0:10:24,71
comets come down, where is it?'


141
0:10:24,71 --> 0:10:26,731
It doesn't affect us in that way.


142
0:10:26,731 --> 0:10:32,562
It will be just like another normal day. You have nothing to fear.


143
0:10:32,562 --> 0:10:35,626
But what might happen, I feel,


144
0:10:35,626 --> 0:10:40,172
could be a great change in consciousness.


145
0:10:40,172 --> 0:10:43,204
What is getting ready to happen is a positive thing,


146
0:10:43,204 --> 0:10:48,8
it is a step forward in an evolution, it's an awakening in consciousness.


147
0:10:48,8 --> 0:10:51,65
This beautiful awakening is quite a positive thing


148
0:10:51,65 --> 0:10:56,894
so it is definitely not something that we should have any fear about.


149
0:10:56,894 --> 0:11:0,45
The society, the way we know now it now,


150
0:11:0,45 --> 0:11:5,341
will not be there anymore or is changing very rapidly.


151
0:11:5,341 --> 0:11:10,105
People don't believe in the old system anymore.


152
0:11:10,105 --> 0:11:13,864
You are not out chasing the so called dream


153
0:11:13,864 --> 0:11:17,178
that you have been brainwashed to believe you should be anymore.


154
0:11:17,178 --> 0:11:21,224
You are actually doing what your inner self dictates to you.


155
0:11:21,224 --> 0:11:25,458
People start to become aware of who they are


156
0:11:25,458 --> 0:11:29,873
and they start to realize that there is more to life


157
0:11:29,873 --> 0:11:34,3
and they really do want more but not in material things,


158
0:11:34,3 --> 0:11:41,987
they want more in terms of peace and love and no more wars


159
0:11:41,987 --> 0:11:48,313
and no more hunger and starving and all these situations.


160
0:11:48,313 --> 0:11:52,696
So, people are starting to realize that there is a community


161
0:11:52,696 --> 0:11:54,607
of humanity out there.


162
0:11:54,607 --> 0:12:0,243
There is a plan to take us into super consciousness.


163
0:12:0,243 --> 0:12:3,978
Every one of us, for a short brief period of time.


164
0:12:3,978 --> 0:12:7,849
A super consciousness is we merge with the divine,


165
0:12:7,849 --> 0:12:9,436
merge with all consciousness,


166
0:12:9,436 --> 0:12:12,386
for a short period of time we know everything,


167
0:12:12,386 --> 0:12:14,104
we come into the oneness.


168
0:12:14,104 --> 0:12:18,227
We are all facets, experiential facets,


169
0:12:18,227 --> 0:12:22,424
Individual little elements or atoms of that divine.


170
0:12:22,424 --> 0:12:27,98
We are experiencing kind of a tsunami right now in consciousness


171
0:12:27,98 --> 0:12:33,88
and it's about ready, in my opinion, to turn into a tidal wave of awareness.


172
0:12:33,88 --> 0:12:38,303
The Mayans are teaching that beautiful things will happen, wonderful things,


173
0:12:38,303 --> 0:12:41,492
great changes in the consciousness of mankind.


174
0:12:41,492 --> 0:12:44,741
Certainly there is a consciousness shift going on.


175
0:12:44,741 --> 0:12:48,964
A prophesied acceleration of both technology and consciousness


176
0:12:48,964 --> 0:12:50,763
is occurring right now,


177
0:12:50,763 --> 0:12:57,856
which is right on time with what's been decoded from the Mayan information.


178
0:12:57,856 --> 0:13:2,31
The Mayans know that the universe is a loving place,


179
0:13:2,31 --> 0:13:5,172
there is chaos and there is love in the universe


180
0:13:5,172 --> 0:13:9,415
and the love is always correcting the chaos.


181
0:13:9,415 --> 0:13:16,679
So, whatever happens in 2012 will be for the advancement of mankind.


182
0:13:16,679 --> 0:13:20,924
All shall benefit, on different levels,


183
0:13:20,924 --> 0:13:23,909
even the unawakened will benefit,


184
0:13:23,909 --> 0:13:29,802
because that's how the universe elevates souls.


185
0:13:29,802 --> 0:13:34,643
We are choosing between spirit consciousness and matter consciousness


186
0:13:34,643 --> 0:13:42,746
and those choices will influence what direction we take after a transformation.


187
0:13:42,746 --> 0:13:52,591
What is happening at this moment is discussed in all the bibles and mythologies of the world.


188
0:13:52,591 --> 0:14:1,313
The ancient ones knew the cycles, the Hindus call this cycle the Yuga cycle of 24,000 years


189
0:14:1,313 --> 0:14:6,516
in which we go through the Gold, Silver, Bronze and Iron Age


190
0:14:6,516 --> 0:14:11,94
just like we go through the yearly Summer, Winter, Summer, Winter


191
0:14:11,94 --> 0:14:14,3
and the daily night and day.


192
0:14:14,3 --> 0:14:22,955
So we do this in the 24,000 year backward precessional cycle


193
0:14:22,955 --> 0:14:29,699
and we are at what the prophecies say is the time of the harvest


194
0:14:29,699 --> 0:14:31,508
the time of the end,


195
0:14:31,508 --> 0:14:36,934
the end of this wave of evolution of mankind


196
0:14:36,934 --> 0:14:41,75
where certain ones ascend, awaken,


197
0:14:41,75 --> 0:14:45,697
remember who they are and reclaim their divinity.


198
0:14:45,697 --> 0:14:51,444
We have to go along with the change that is happening


199
0:14:51,444 --> 0:14:54,8
as oppose to fear it and resist it.


200
0:14:54,8 --> 0:14:58,62
And when we go into fear and loathing, our body shuts down,


201
0:14:58,62 --> 0:15:1,147
our chakras, our consciousness.


202
0:15:1,147 --> 0:15:7,762
It's possible people in that frame of mind could even get left behind.


203
0:15:7,762 --> 0:15:11,49
On the other hand if they open up and accept it and become a part of it


204
0:15:11,49 --> 0:15:14,976
and they become part of an amazing transformation


205
0:15:14,976 --> 0:15:26,861
that is getting ready to occur.


206
0:15:26,861 --> 0:15:33,75
What is really in fact going to happen is the Galactic Alignment.


207
0:15:33,75 --> 0:15:34,343
In two respects,


208
0:15:34,343 --> 0:15:37,876
if you look at the galactic plane, if you imagine that the galaxy


209
0:15:37,876 --> 0:15:40,619
is a very very thin dish in the heavens.


210
0:15:40,619 --> 0:15:47,474
Well our Sun it's in a cycle of 24,000 years, called precession of the equinoxes


211
0:15:47,474 --> 0:15:52,491
and during that cycle it spends 12,000 years above the equator


212
0:15:52,491 --> 0:15:55,27
of the milky way galaxy, the galactic plane,


213
0:15:55,27 --> 0:15:57,406
and 12,000 years below.


214
0:15:57,406 --> 0:16:2,975
So, our Sun is now sitting below the galactic plane and its popping its head through


215
0:16:2,975 --> 0:16:6,502
and its passing that galactic plane right now as we speak


216
0:16:6,502 --> 0:16:11,148
and on the 21 December 2012 it will be more over then under.


217
0:16:11,148 --> 0:16:16,239
The other aspect of this is that the equinoxes have been migrating


218
0:16:16,239 --> 0:16:22,538
around the heavens through the signs of the zodiac for 24,000 years.


219
0:16:22,538 --> 0:16:26,391
The vernal equinox occurs on the 21st of March.


220
0:16:26,391 --> 0:16:30,801
Now, at the moment on the 21st of March is actually Pisces,


221
0:16:30,801 --> 0:16:36,791
because its the sign that appears on the horizon on the 21st of March,


222
0:16:36,791 --> 0:16:39,789
that sign, is the sign that we are in.


223
0:16:39,789 --> 0:16:42,74
Now we have been in that sign,


224
0:16:42,74 --> 0:16:45,646
the Sun has been in it at the equinox for 2,000 years.


225
0:16:45,646 --> 0:16:51,385
Now it is right at the end of Pisces and the new sign coming through is Aquarius


226
0:16:51,385 --> 0:16:54,499
and the Sun will be in Aquarius for 2,000 years.


227
0:16:54,499 --> 0:16:57,216
Each age is about approximately 2,000 years.


228
0:16:57,216 --> 0:17:2,423
Each age represents a kind of a level of consciousness and at each shift,


229
0:17:2,423 --> 0:17:4,233
there is a shift in consciousness.


230
0:17:4,233 --> 0:17:9,873
That's the symbol for Aquarius, so the age of Aquarius is happening right now.


231
0:17:9,873 --> 0:17:17,9
The age of Aquarius represents a period where instead of spiritually speaking,


232
0:17:17,9 --> 0:17:24,872
instead of worshiping the single God or Guru


233
0:17:24,872 --> 0:17:28,734
or martyr on the cross or whatever you want to have.


234
0:17:28,734 --> 0:17:31,352
Instead of focusing your energies in that way,


235
0:17:31,352 --> 0:17:35,65
the age of the Aquarius tends to look for truth in one another,


236
0:17:35,65 --> 0:17:37,698
in each other, in each individual person.


237
0:17:37,698 --> 0:17:40,605
That's a big shift in the consciousness,


238
0:17:40,605 --> 0:17:47,338
it also represents the onset of technology, but hopefully clean technology.


239
0:17:47,338 --> 0:17:50,418
The Piscean age, is an age of division.


240
0:17:50,418 --> 0:17:53,725
The Age of the Piscean has been true to its name,


241
0:17:53,725 --> 0:17:55,898
we have been very divided.


242
0:17:55,898 --> 0:18:0,554
Coloured people, different languages, different cultures,


243
0:18:0,554 --> 0:18:7,117
different concepts and ideas, we are so divided, its horrific.


244
0:18:7,117 --> 0:18:11,744
We can look forward to an age of harmony with Aquarius,


245
0:18:11,744 --> 0:18:19,219
a greater level  of understanding and unity of consciousness.


246
0:18:19,219 --> 0:18:23,791
And Aquarius is an air sign, it's a fixed air.


247
0:18:23,791 --> 0:18:28,511
So it's nature is quiet different to the mutable water of Pisces.


248
0:18:28,511 --> 0:18:31,992
We have been in a mutable cross for 2,000 years.


249
0:18:31,992 --> 0:18:36,758
The equinoxes and they have been in the mutable signs of Pisces,


250
0:18:36,758 --> 0:18:38,593
this is the March equinox.


251
0:18:38,593 --> 0:18:41,18
Virgo the other equinox


252
0:18:41,18 --> 0:18:47,107
and the solstices have been in Gemini, the solstice of June, June the 21st


253
0:18:47,107 --> 0:18:49,81
and Sagittarius, December 21st.


254
0:18:49,81 --> 0:18:53,483
Now what is happening as the equinoxes move around that clock


255
0:18:53,483 --> 0:18:55,877
and they come into the fixed signs.


256
0:18:55,877 --> 0:19:1,516
What is going to happen is this, the vernal equinox will be in Aquarius,


257
0:19:1,516 --> 0:19:7,4
the autumnal equinox will be in Leo, which is fixed fire.


258
0:19:7,4 --> 0:19:10,669
The solstices will go to Taurus, fixed earth


259
0:19:10,669 --> 0:19:15,863
and the Winter solstice will go to Scorpio, fixed water.


260
0:19:15,863 --> 0:19:19,18
Now, these four signs are the fixed signs.


261
0:19:19,18 --> 0:19:23,799
So the holy cross, the divine cross in the skies will be in situated


262
0:19:23,799 --> 0:19:27,899
in their most natural home - the fixed signs.


263
0:19:27,899 --> 0:19:30,826
Well in this age it have been in Pisces, which is mutable,


264
0:19:30,826 --> 0:19:33,991
and before that it was Aries, which is cardinal.


265
0:19:33,991 --> 0:19:38,398
So, now it gets to be fixed and that is the alignment.


266
0:19:38,398 --> 0:19:45,211
That is what is taking places, because those signs there are very very powerful,


267
0:19:45,211 --> 0:19:46,858
the fixed signs.


268
0:19:46,858 --> 0:19:50,367
They are very powerful in transformation of the human consciousness


269
0:19:50,367 --> 0:19:54,368
and in the bible and in the holly books,


270
0:19:54,368 --> 0:19:59,758
they are the lion, the bull, the man and the eagle.


271
0:19:59,758 --> 0:20:4,221
In Revelation the God is described as having the face of the man,


272
0:20:4,221 --> 0:20:8,114
the face of the bull, the face of the eagles and the face of the lion.


273
0:20:8,114 --> 0:20:13,415
Well that is the fixed signs of the Zodiac, they are going home.


274
0:20:13,415 --> 0:20:16,17
The equinoxes and the solstices are going home


275
0:20:16,17 --> 0:20:18,899
and that is what we are looking forward to.


276
0:20:18,899 --> 0:20:22,674
That is what it means, there is big things happening with 2012.


277
0:20:22,674 --> 0:20:26,299
We are getting ready to evolve at a very fast rate.


278
0:20:26,299 --> 0:20:31,27
The reason this happens is because the center of the galaxy


279
0:20:31,27 --> 0:20:34,578
puts out pulses and their waves.


280
0:20:34,578 --> 0:20:38,651
The reason it does that, is the same reason a cell in your body


281
0:20:38,651 --> 0:20:42,821
puts out vibration within that cell


282
0:20:42,821 --> 0:20:46,225
to make sure that the cell as a whole


283
0:20:46,225 --> 0:20:49,916
is operating on the same page.


284
0:20:49,916 --> 0:20:54,693
To make sure those of us on the perimeter of the galaxy


285
0:20:54,693 --> 0:20:58,804
are in tune with the evolution of the whole galaxy.


286
0:20:58,804 --> 0:21:3,613
Now, I feel, that if you look at these massive transformations


287
0:21:3,613 --> 0:21:6,249
in the evolution of life on the planet,


288
0:21:6,249 --> 0:21:8,306
it is always a positive shift.


289
0:21:8,306 --> 0:21:13,823
It wasn't like at one of the intervals, that all of a sudden


290
0:21:13,823 --> 0:21:17,297
life became more retarded


291
0:21:17,297 --> 0:21:23,341
and started de-evolving or going in the opposite direction.


292
0:21:23,341 --> 0:21:26,768
If there is a wave of consciousness


293
0:21:26,768 --> 0:21:30,631
that is sent out from the centre of the galaxy


294
0:21:30,631 --> 0:21:33,799
and we pass through one of these waves,


295
0:21:33,799 --> 0:21:37,862
then the consciousness on the planet as a whole


296
0:21:37,862 --> 0:21:43,312
begins to expand and vibrate at a higher frequency.


297
0:21:43,312 --> 0:21:58,361
Evolve much faster then previously before.


298
0:21:58,361 --> 0:22:3,689
There is what's called Yugas and Yugas means world ages


299
0:22:3,689 --> 0:22:8,592
and it starts of with what's called Satya Yuga, which means Golden,


300
0:22:8,592 --> 0:22:14,344
then it devolves into Treta, which means Silver.


301
0:22:14,344 --> 0:22:18,68
Then we  go to Dwapara and this means Bronze


302
0:22:18,68 --> 0:22:22,326
and currently we are in the Kali Yuga, which means Iron.


303
0:22:22,326 --> 0:22:26,326
These cycles of Ages go around continuously.


304
0:22:26,326 --> 0:22:33,374
The Golden Age last for 1,768 million years.


305
0:22:33,374 --> 0:22:41,682
That humans live for 100,000 years, that gold is something you eat of


306
0:22:41,682 --> 0:22:45,929
and maybe just discard, like a paper plate today.


307
0:22:45,929 --> 0:22:49,973
The point is that they are very highly advanced souls.


308
0:22:49,973 --> 0:22:55,894
The human earth planet, under the Satya Yuga - Golden Age,


309
0:22:55,894 --> 0:23:1,962
is only occupied by Mystics, serious Yogis.


310
0:23:1,962 --> 0:23:7,417
It is described that the demonic's live on another planet.


311
0:23:7,417 --> 0:23:10,145
So we are separated by space.


312
0:23:10,145 --> 0:23:17,54
Than as we move in to the Treta Yuga - Silver Age, it become 1,296 years,


313
0:23:17,54 --> 0:23:20,962
people live for 10,000 year, they eat of Silver.


314
0:23:20,962 --> 0:23:25,456
and now the demons live on another country on the same planet.


315
0:23:25,456 --> 0:23:27,473
the only the only thing separating is ocean.


316
0:23:27,473 --> 0:23:32,579
Then we come into Dwapara Yuga Bronze age, which is 864,000 years,


317
0:23:32,579 --> 0:23:35,151
or half the length of the Golden Age,


318
0:23:35,151 --> 0:23:37,982
people live for a thousand years,


319
0:23:37,982 --> 0:23:42,182
they have good and bad in the same family.


320
0:23:42,182 --> 0:23:48,699
You can see in the old testaments, that is Bronze age culture, Dwapara Yuga,


321
0:23:48,699 --> 0:23:51,918
so they are living for a thousand years - all the old testament folks -


322
0:23:51,918 --> 0:23:56,93
Noah or Adam - all lived for a longer time than we do.


323
0:23:56,93 --> 0:23:59,293
And then we come into Iron age,


324
0:23:59,293 --> 0:24:3,251
in Iron age we going to live 100, good and bad is in each and every


325
0:24:3,251 --> 0:24:8,161
single one of us, it's not separate now. It is in us.


326
0:24:8,161 --> 0:24:15,194
And we have to become conscious of not to 'fan the flame' of the negative actions.


327
0:24:15,194 --> 0:24:20,895
We have to take some very strict codes of behavior, if you're serious,


328
0:24:20,895 --> 0:24:24,651
I mean you can do anything you want on Earth, but if you are serious,


329
0:24:24,651 --> 0:24:28,235
if you want a ticket  out of the material world, based on this,


330
0:24:28,235 --> 0:24:32,31
we might like the Earth planet, but it's a prison.


331
0:24:32,31 --> 0:24:38,788
We can expect in 2012 to enjoy a much more harmonious world


332
0:24:38,788 --> 0:24:42,348
and high consciousness, because where the sun is taking us


333
0:24:42,348 --> 0:24:48,716
in the 24,000 year processional cycle, is - back to the Dwapara Yuga.


334
0:24:48,716 --> 0:24:53,16
Certain Hindu scholars say that we have already entered Dwapara Yuga


335
0:24:53,16 --> 0:24:57,331
in the 1700's, so about 200-300 years ago,


336
0:24:57,331 --> 0:25:1,224
whereas others tend to say that the Dwapara Yuga has not began yet,


337
0:25:1,224 --> 0:25:3,44
we are still at the end of Kali Yuga.


338
0:25:3,44 --> 0:25:8,656
Nonetheless, in all the traditions, we are at that time


339
0:25:8,656 --> 0:25:12,741
when a great transition takes place.


340
0:25:12,741 --> 0:25:18,115
A wonderful transition, and all the religious traditions are looking forward


341
0:25:18,115 --> 0:25:22,994
to this time, because they know that it will bring much peace


342
0:25:22,994 --> 0:25:26,221
and love and joy and wisdom to mankind.


343
0:25:26,221 --> 0:25:31,311
This is a cycle which continues in its nature and behavior,


344
0:25:31,311 --> 0:25:33,616
but does never come back to the same place.


345
0:25:33,616 --> 0:25:38,168
So we are always growing with this, the feathered serpent, our solar system,


346
0:25:38,168 --> 0:25:41,444
we just have to trust that feathered serpent takes us to greener pastures,


347
0:25:41,444 --> 0:25:46,519
in fact the Mayans tells us that it will, because on the 21st December 2012,


348
0:25:46,519 --> 0:25:51,291
where this galactic alignment is going to occur, then we shall start newer influences


349
0:25:51,291 --> 0:25:55,565
and different influences that we have not seen for a long time since our awakening,


350
0:25:55,565 --> 0:25:56,955
cause we are awakening.


351
0:25:56,955 --> 0:25:59,78
And the dead that shall arise that the scriptures are talking about


352
0:25:59,78 --> 0:26:1,563
"The dead shall rise",


353
0:26:1,563 --> 0:26:7,307
that's not dead in terms of in a tomb and then all of the sudden


354
0:26:7,307 --> 0:26:10,918
you pop up out of the tomb as literal as Christianity is trying to teach,


355
0:26:10,918 --> 0:26:18,406
its talking about - we.. that we have been dead in sleep fullness,


356
0:26:18,406 --> 0:26:20,519
we have been sleeping.


357
0:26:20,519 --> 0:26:24,604
Now, as we learn this stuff, and we remember the symbols now


358
0:26:24,604 --> 0:26:26,281
cause we know what these mean,


359
0:26:26,281 --> 0:26:30,833
they've been lying dormant in the winter of unconsciousness for thousands of years,


360
0:26:30,833 --> 0:26:35,986
and the Romans went destroying the temples of Egypt and defacing their monuments


361
0:26:35,986 --> 0:26:38,206
and the hieroglyphs that they didn't understand,


362
0:26:38,206 --> 0:26:44,464
and the Christians they destroyed the Mediterranean's cultural,


363
0:26:44,464 --> 0:26:47,226
spiritual, hermetic heritage.


364
0:26:47,226 --> 0:26:49,352
Alexandrian the Library was burnt,


365
0:26:49,352 --> 0:26:56,402
in Jerusalem the Temple of the Initiates there was destroyed.


366
0:26:56,402 --> 0:27:0,657
Carthage - you know, she snuffed out all the lights so that she could rule


367
0:27:0,657 --> 0:27:3,759
in the fictional world for thousands of years.


368
0:27:3,759 --> 0:27:12,403
Now as we awaken and we reclaim our dominion, this science is essential.


369
0:27:12,403 --> 0:27:15,699
Astrology is the science of "As Above So Below".


370
0:27:15,699 --> 0:27:18,238
And it is the beginning of understanding of who you are.


371
0:27:18,238 --> 0:27:22,564
When you realize that you are this and you look up and you go


372
0:27:22,564 --> 0:27:26,204
"Twinkle twinkle little star how I wonder what you are?",


373
0:27:26,204 --> 0:27:29,672
and you know what the stars are, they are fountains of life.


374
0:27:29,672 --> 0:27:33,113
Firstly, we have Solar System, Sol being the Sun,


375
0:27:33,113 --> 0:27:39,23
the male energetic in our solar system, and all the planets are regarded as feminine,


376
0:27:39,23 --> 0:27:42,737
generally speaking, dancing with the masculine.


377
0:27:42,737 --> 0:27:50,27
We, as human beings with the human eye can only see the seventh planet.


378
0:27:50,27 --> 0:27:54,449
Five planets, actually - Sun and Moon.


379
0:27:54,449 --> 0:27:58,226
The external planets, or the planets in the outer solar system


380
0:27:58,226 --> 0:28:4,987
cannot be seen by the human eyesight without an optical instrument.


381
0:28:4,987 --> 0:28:11,62
Those seven planets are influencing us daily. And, if you want the proof,


382
0:28:11,62 --> 0:28:16,739
go to your newspaper, and you will see in the weather area "Sunrise" - "Sunset",


383
0:28:16,739 --> 0:28:21,83
"Moonrise" - "Moonset", and in a special little box


384
0:28:21,83 --> 0:28:27,128
the rising of Venus, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter... They are there. It's there.


385
0:28:27,128 --> 0:28:31,66
Now, they've been trying to eradicate astrology,


386
0:28:31,66 --> 0:28:34,917
because the grand Christian church doesn't accept it.


387
0:28:34,917 --> 0:28:39,269
But, actually, they are the only group in the world that doesn't.


388
0:28:39,269 --> 0:28:41,881
The Jews are based in astrology,


389
0:28:41,881 --> 0:28:47,839
you can see the remnants of it in the Christian church with the twelve apostles,


390
0:28:47,839 --> 0:28:50,191
they have replaced the houses of the Zodiac.


391
0:28:50,191 --> 0:28:55,161
And if you go into a Hindu temple, when you firstly go in, on a left,


392
0:28:55,161 --> 0:28:58,152
you'll see twelve constellations as deities,


393
0:28:58,152 --> 0:29:0,4
when you go all the way around the temple


394
0:29:0,4 --> 0:29:4,198
to see all the other persons in the temple, then there's the seven planets.


395
0:29:4,198 --> 0:29:9,761
If it's a bright sunny day when you wake up, it's having a good effect.


396
0:29:9,761 --> 0:29:16,43
If the clouds get between you and the sun, it filters that good effect.


397
0:29:16,43 --> 0:29:24,552
Now for plant life, aquatic or tidal behavior, all feminine life on the world planet


398
0:29:24,552 --> 0:29:27,23
is governed by the Moon.


399
0:29:27,23 --> 0:29:31,436
That's why we call it the Menstrual cycle from the word Moonstral cycle,


400
0:29:31,436 --> 0:29:36,143
and the other word we say is a Luna cycle - Luna-tic.


401
0:29:36,143 --> 0:29:39,39
And the law knows, the police know, and every authority knows


402
0:29:39,39 --> 0:29:45,153
that as the moon moves into its full position,


403
0:29:45,153 --> 0:29:48,269
it has an esoteric effect on humanity.


404
0:29:48,269 --> 0:29:52,937
Many, many more stupid acts will be occurring around the full moon.


405
0:29:52,937 --> 0:29:59,2
Do they affect us? Absolutely. The Sun and the Moon are the strongest.


406
0:29:59,2 --> 0:30:6,782
Sirius B goes around Sirius A, and it takes 49.9 years.


407
0:30:6,782 --> 0:30:11,484
It is so heavy, that a teaspoon of it would be hundreds of tons.


408
0:30:11,484 --> 0:30:20,846
It is spinning on its axis 23 times every minute. This is a sun, this is a star guys,


409
0:30:20,846 --> 0:30:23,889
like it's that heavy... imagine how heavy it is!


410
0:30:23,889 --> 0:30:28,973
And it is so powerful magnetically, that it directly affects our Earth.


411
0:30:28,973 --> 0:30:32,974
In 1989, when this little fella here,


412
0:30:32,974 --> 0:30:37,822
this very heavy hard little fella - when he passed between


413
0:30:37,822 --> 0:30:44,88
Sirius A and our Sun with its Earth going around here,


414
0:30:44,88 --> 0:30:49,856
the spin rate slowed down in '89, losing a full second per day


415
0:30:49,856 --> 0:30:53,181
for a period of several weeks before the event,


416
0:30:53,181 --> 0:31:1,44
and then sped up gaining a second per day for several weeks after the event.


417
0:31:1,44 --> 0:31:6,705
Take note of that men, that's a star that is 8 light years away.


418
0:31:6,705 --> 0:31:9,392
It slowed and sped our Earth.


419
0:31:9,392 --> 0:31:14,6
If we have a good look at our solar system and how it works,


420
0:31:14,6 --> 0:31:17,89
for instance the moon goes around the earth,


421
0:31:17,89 --> 0:31:24,832
the earth in turn is rotating and orbiting the sun.


422
0:31:24,832 --> 0:31:29,215
So, it takes 365 days to go around the Sun.


423
0:31:29,215 --> 0:31:33,237
Now our sun in turn is orbiting Sirius.


424
0:31:33,237 --> 0:31:41,196
Sirius being the brightest star in the sky and in the sector of Cancer right near Gemini,


425
0:31:41,196 --> 0:31:47,445
it is in a binary with our star and every 24,000 years we go around each other


426
0:31:47,445 --> 0:31:49,401
in a clockwise motion.


427
0:31:49,401 --> 0:31:52,681
Sirius and our Sun have been going away from each other


428
0:31:52,681 --> 0:31:56,457
for the last couple of thousand years, and now they've turned the corner,


429
0:31:56,457 --> 0:31:58,129
so they are heading towards one another.


430
0:31:58,129 --> 0:32:1,314
As we reach the outer limits of that orbit,


431
0:32:1,314 --> 0:32:5,2
that elliptical orbit with our Sun and Sirius,


432
0:32:5,2 --> 0:32:9,741
this is where the Iron age is, the Golden age is when they are close to each other


433
0:32:9,741 --> 0:32:15,15
and as they separate they go through Silver and the Bronze to the Iron age.


434
0:32:15,15 --> 0:32:18,514
Well, that affects the consciousness of mankind.


435
0:32:18,514 --> 0:32:23,17
Because we have 100% consciousness when the stars are close to each other,


436
0:32:23,17 --> 0:32:27,225
the consciousness falls to 75%, 50% and 25%.


437
0:32:27,225 --> 0:32:30,787
We have not enjoyed full consciousness for a long time.


438
0:32:30,787 --> 0:32:34,421
And many of the gifts and abilities and powers that we once had.


439
0:32:34,421 --> 0:32:41,312
As we have turned the corner in the great orbit of our two suns - Sirius and our Sun,


440
0:32:41,312 --> 0:32:45,398
as we have turned the corner and they are hurtling towards each other now,


441
0:32:45,398 --> 0:32:48,17
we have turned corner from the dark ages.


442
0:32:48,17 --> 0:32:49,873
We have come out of the dark period,


443
0:32:49,873 --> 0:32:56,338
because the suns have been pulled apart and their influence is weakened


444
0:32:56,338 --> 0:33:0,632
and therefore our consciousness has dropped, and we are in the dark ages.


445
0:33:0,632 --> 0:33:4,587
Now they're pulling towards each other, bringing us to a higher consciousness.


446
0:33:4,587 --> 0:33:7,481
And that's nature.


447
0:33:7,481 --> 0:33:15,227
Nature brings us, ascends, helps us and carries us through ascension process,


448
0:33:15,227 --> 0:33:16,675
so it's all loving.


449
0:33:16,675 --> 0:33:22,489
Even though there is chaos, and there's fear and anguish


450
0:33:22,489 --> 0:33:26,62
and chaotic events occurring around us in our world,


451
0:33:26,62 --> 0:33:31,15
even though that is happening, that's really just the remnants of the dark ages.


452
0:33:31,15 --> 0:33:33,4
So we've turned the corner!


453
0:33:33,4 --> 0:33:39,306
The two suns are hurtling towards each other at great speeds now,


454
0:33:39,306 --> 0:33:42,843
and that's the beautiful part of where we are.


455
0:33:42,843 --> 0:33:44,32
We've turned the corner.


456
0:33:44,32 --> 0:33:50,155
So we are really in just a great time in history to be living, it's just amazing time.


457
0:33:50,155 --> 0:33:55,494
The great changes that we will see with our own eyes will just be stupendous.


458
0:33:55,494 --> 0:33:59,205
We are actually just simply locked into a series of cycles.


459
0:33:59,205 --> 0:34:3,766
And it's the duty of every human being, when there're ready...


460
0:34:3,766 --> 0:34:10,824
to discovery their own awareness, to take control of themselves.


461
0:34:10,824 --> 0:34:13,6
In the book of Daniel of the bible it says that in this time,


462
0:34:13,6 --> 0:34:17,599
many will come to an accurate knowledge of the truth


463
0:34:17,599 --> 0:34:22,688
and they will whiten their robes, and they will turn to the truth.


464
0:34:22,688 --> 0:34:26,401
But it also mentions that many will just go off into the darkness


465
0:34:26,401 --> 0:34:30,7
and continue on the path of darkness.


466
0:34:30,7 --> 0:34:32,622
It's true we are in the dark age right now,


467
0:34:32,622 --> 0:34:35,4
but we are getting ready to come out of it.


468
0:34:35,4 --> 0:34:39,26
And those who identify with the darkness,


469
0:34:39,26 --> 0:34:42,804
those who feel at home and comfortable with it,


470
0:34:42,804 --> 0:34:46,978
yeah they want to keep it that way, they don't want things to change.


471
0:34:46,978 --> 0:34:54,444
They are afraid of light coming in, they are afraid of people waking up.


472
0:34:54,444 --> 0:35:1,44
If everyone starts to find out, what 2012 is really about,


473
0:35:1,44 --> 0:35:4,848
then that's going to accelerate the process even more,


474
0:35:4,848 --> 0:35:7,859
they are going to start catching onto the true of what's happening,


475
0:35:7,859 --> 0:35:24,15
so to suppress the information is part of the 2012 agenda.


476
0:35:24,15 --> 0:35:27,838
The media portrays 2012 as doomsday.


477
0:35:27,838 --> 0:35:30,331
The world will end, mankind will end,


478
0:35:30,331 --> 0:35:33,597
comets will come down, and who knows what.


479
0:35:33,597 --> 0:35:38,642
The agenda seems to be trying to put a negative spin on it.


480
0:35:38,642 --> 0:35:42,784
Britney spears: "Keep on dancing until the world ends,


481
0:35:42,784 --> 0:36:28,673
if you feel it, let it happen, keep on dancing till the world ends"


482
0:36:28,673 --> 0:36:28,673
Song: "Looks like we made it..."


483
0:36:28,673 --> 0:36:30,781
Voice: "Get it on for the end of the world.


484
0:36:30,781 --> 0:36:33,962
New Lynx 2012: The Final Edition."


485
0:36:33,962 --> 0:36:36,958
"A growing number of Americans getting ready for doomsday.


486
0:36:36,958 --> 0:36:39,219
You think that's crazy? Right after the break,


487
0:36:39,219 --> 0:36:41,304
spend a couple of minutes listening to our next guest,


488
0:36:41,304 --> 0:36:43,308
and see what you think then."


489
0:36:43,308 --> 0:36:46,672
"Well, you may have your car, lawn mower


490
0:36:46,672 --> 0:36:48,607
and your family junk stuffed in your garage,


491
0:36:48,607 --> 0:36:52,903
but for one Arizona man it is the staging area for doomsday.


492
0:36:52,903 --> 0:36:54,557
And he is not the only one.


493
0:36:54,557 --> 0:36:58,493
The supplies and tools he needs to survive the Apocalypse,


494
0:36:58,493 --> 0:37:0,15
whichever way it may come."


495
0:37:0,15 --> 0:37:4,59
"People preparing for, basically, the end of days,


496
0:37:4,59 --> 0:37:7,436
and extreme doomsday bunkers.


497
0:37:7,436 --> 0:37:10,331
Jack Jobe is joining us now with more about that."


498
0:37:10,331 --> 0:37:13,36
"Well, there is a phenomena right now among people,


499
0:37:13,36 --> 0:37:15,585
especially because of year 2012,


500
0:37:15,585 --> 0:37:21,13
to take more advantage of being prepared for doomsday-like disasters"


501
0:37:21,13 --> 0:37:25,67
"Thousands are now on high alert, stock-piling food


502
0:37:25,67 --> 0:37:28,31
and building underground bunkers - even in Australia.


503
0:37:28,31 --> 0:37:32,218
And companies are cashing in - they're selling survival items,


504
0:37:32,218 --> 0:37:34,976
like gas masks, nuclear protection suits,


505
0:37:34,976 --> 0:37:38,348
and even food and water tablets"


506
0:37:38,348 --> 0:37:44,3
The obvious question comes - why would anyone want


507
0:37:44,3 --> 0:37:47,329
to take something that isn't necessarily negative


508
0:37:47,329 --> 0:37:51,435
and, even worse, something that is actually a positive thing,


509
0:37:51,435 --> 0:37:54,21
and turn it into a negative thing?


510
0:37:54,21 --> 0:38:2,494
Using it as a means to radiate fear out on the planet, as opposed to love?


511
0:38:2,494 --> 0:38:7,876
The people who got the hooks into this information - disinformation,


512
0:38:7,876 --> 0:38:12,326
misinformation - have really hoodwinked humanity's progress.


513
0:38:12,326 --> 0:38:18,148
So, in the movie for instance, 2012, there's fear and loathing,


514
0:38:18,148 --> 0:38:22,211
and this is so far away from what the potential is.


515
0:38:22,211 --> 0:38:26,606
Cause if you can radiate fear that can keep that frequency,


516
0:38:26,606 --> 0:38:30,965
which is expanding and growing higher, contracted,


517
0:38:30,965 --> 0:38:35,181
that to me suits the 2012 agenda.


518
0:38:35,181 --> 0:38:40,455
Well with regard to 2012, the media is not the place


519
0:38:40,455 --> 0:38:43,969
source for information, it will be misinformation,


520
0:38:43,969 --> 0:38:49,153
and it will be negative... and it is. It's very negative.


521
0:38:49,153 --> 0:38:53,868
And, of course, they are driven by fear, and they love fear,


522
0:38:53,868 --> 0:38:58,944
and the people who control those stations and those networks,


523
0:38:58,944 --> 0:39:4,72
they are happy to generate fear.


524
0:39:4,72 --> 0:39:9,8
"Clips warning viewers about December 21st 2012,


525
0:39:9,8 --> 0:39:11,89
that's the date that many doomsday prophets are claiming


526
0:39:11,89 --> 0:39:14,607
the world as we know it will end.


527
0:39:14,607 --> 0:39:18,805
My next guest Jim Durdan works with survival group

529
0:39:21,161 --> 0:39:25,816
Jim, how will it happen will it be an object from outer space,


530
0:39:25,816 --> 0:39:29,201
will we destroy ourselves in a nuclear holocaust?


531
0:39:29,201 --> 0:39:31,311
How will it happen in 2012?"


532
0:39:31,311 --> 0:39:35,9
"Well, based on Mayan calendar and the Dresden Codex,


533
0:39:35,9 --> 0:39:40,128
the Egyptians and Mayans had the end times of 2012


534
0:39:40,128 --> 0:39:43,624
as an apocalyptic event."


535
0:39:43,624 --> 0:39:48,396
"Their calendar predicts that 21st of December is when the world will end.


536
0:39:48,396 --> 0:39:51,891
And while that won't stop the most of us from making plans for Christmas,


537
0:39:51,891 --> 0:39:55,241
there are tens of thousands of believers who are preparing for the worst."


538
0:39:55,241 --> 0:40:0,546
"According to one ancient prophecy, the end of the world is only weeks away,


539
0:40:0,546 --> 0:40:2,714
so - are you ready?


540
0:40:2,714 --> 0:40:6,564
It's the ancient calendar that ends on December 21 this year,


541
0:40:6,564 --> 0:40:8,738
in other words - doomsday."


542
0:40:8,738 --> 0:40:11,591
It's not the Mayans telling us this business,


543
0:40:11,591 --> 0:40:16,328
it's westerners interpreting what they think the Mayans were saying.


544
0:40:16,328 --> 0:40:21,452
They see a stela, they see a piece of carving and then they start to interpret.


545
0:40:21,452 --> 0:40:24,956
What a joke. What an absolute joke.


546
0:40:24,956 --> 0:40:30,1
There's been a lot of co-opted, incorrect information out there.


547
0:40:30,1 --> 0:40:31,169
And it's deliberate.


548
0:40:31,169 --> 0:40:35,907
Major media destroy information.


549
0:40:35,907 --> 0:40:43,757
If we had a mainstream media that even vaguely associated itself


550
0:40:43,757 --> 0:40:45,997
with the true meaning of the word Journalism,


551
0:40:45,997 --> 0:40:48,402
none of this would have been possible.


552
0:40:48,402 --> 0:40:53,732
But, the same people that control the politicians, own the media.


553
0:40:53,732 --> 0:40:57,414
And so, the media is not there, just like governments,


554
0:40:57,414 --> 0:41:1,242
to serve the interests and inform the people.


555
0:41:1,242 --> 0:41:4,836
is there to tell the people what those who own the media,


556
0:41:4,836 --> 0:41:6,64
want them to believe.


557
0:41:6,64 --> 0:41:9,878
They see this consciousness happening and they are fighting it


558
0:41:9,878 --> 0:41:11,882
with everything they've got.


559
0:41:11,882 --> 0:41:15,567
And so they are trying to turn it into a negative thing


560
0:41:15,567 --> 0:41:19,185
as opposed to a positive thing which is really what's occurring.


561
0:41:19,185 --> 0:41:21,174
If you take the Mayan perspective,


562
0:41:21,174 --> 0:41:24,756
the Mayans have got a totally different perspective to what we think,


563
0:41:24,756 --> 0:41:28,161
to what we have been taught, but they believe that good things are coming.


564
0:41:28,161 --> 0:41:30,641
"The Mayans themselves never said that world would come to an end.


565
0:41:30,641 --> 0:41:33,7
The only guy who did, the first guy was Jose Arguelles,


566
0:41:33,7 --> 0:41:36,981
who later renamed himself Valum Votan the ancient Mayan God,


567
0:41:36,981 --> 0:41:38,788
cause he turned into a reincarnation of it,


568
0:41:38,788 --> 0:41:42,352
and he in 1988 wrote a book called The Maya Factor,


569
0:41:42,352 --> 0:41:44,595
but the Mayans themselves have said the complete opposite,


570
0:41:44,595 --> 0:41:48,308
they had left behind carvings in stone, saying that there would be


571
0:41:48,308 --> 0:41:49,887
good things happening in the future,


572
0:41:49,887 --> 0:41:52,462
like such and such day after 21st of December."


573
0:41:52,462 --> 0:41:57,91
And the fear for mankind is basically the fear of death,


574
0:41:57,91 --> 0:41:58,633
which we shouldn't have,


575
0:41:58,633 --> 0:42:5,33
because if we continued to teach our original nature religion


576
0:42:5,33 --> 0:42:8,283
and we didn't stop in the advent of Christianity,


577
0:42:8,283 --> 0:42:13,618
we would still know, we would know that death of our body


578
0:42:13,618 --> 0:42:19,399
is just a non-event, because the soul is immortal,


579
0:42:19,399 --> 0:42:23,645
but because we have lost this wisdom and true religion


580
0:42:23,645 --> 0:42:28,252
about the soul and its immortal nature, with fictional religions,


581
0:42:28,252 --> 0:42:29,902
we have fear of death.


582
0:42:29,902 --> 0:42:32,36
There was never fear of death.


583
0:42:32,36 --> 0:42:39,195
The fear sets up a victim - perpetrator - and rescuer cycle,


584
0:42:39,195 --> 0:42:46,559
and we get trapped in that victim mentality or perpetrator or rescuer,


585
0:42:46,559 --> 0:42:48,373
a rescuer is just another victim.


586
0:42:48,373 --> 0:42:51,56
And there's nothing more debilitating, more controlling


587
0:42:51,56 --> 0:42:53,556
and limiting than the "Victim Mentality."


588
0:42:53,556 --> 0:42:57,211
We are encouraged by this manipulation throughout our life


589
0:42:57,211 --> 0:43:0,119
to see ourselves as victims to blame someone else


590
0:43:0,119 --> 0:43:5,12
"Oh, I'm the victim, I'm in this situation because of A, B, C, D...," and on it goes.


591
0:43:5,12 --> 0:43:7,662
And when we are in that state, we are going to stay in that state,


592
0:43:7,662 --> 0:43:11,445
cause when you think you are a victim, the victim vibe goes out,


593
0:43:11,445 --> 0:43:13,89
the victim circumstance goes in.


594
0:43:13,89 --> 0:43:16,648
When you say "Hey, I'm not a victim, I'm in control of my life,


595
0:43:16,648 --> 0:43:19,131
I've created these circumstances I don't like,


596
0:43:19,131 --> 0:43:21,209
therefore I can create circumstances I do."


597
0:43:21,209 --> 0:43:25,95
At that point victim mentality is gone, victim circumstances stop being attracted,


598
0:43:25,95 --> 0:43:29,701
and suddenly people come into your life who were just the people you need


599
0:43:29,701 --> 0:43:31,87
to get you out of the circumstances you don't like,


600
0:43:31,87 --> 0:43:35,239
and if you don't realize what's happening, and most of us don't at the time,


601
0:43:35,239 --> 0:43:39,968
we say "Oh my, mate, I was so lucky - this fella came into my life


602
0:43:39,968 --> 0:43:43,57
at just the right time, this person... I couldn't believe it, amazing luck!"


603
0:43:43,57 --> 0:43:48,2
No. You pulled them in, because your state of being had changed,


604
0:43:48,2 --> 0:43:52,13
and you synced with what you needed to get out of that situation.


605
0:43:52,13 --> 0:43:56,155
We are so in control of our destiny, it's unbelievable,


606
0:43:56,155 --> 0:43:58,479
and yet, billions are persuaded they are not,


607
0:43:58,479 --> 0:44:1,115
and therefore they create a very different reality.


608
0:44:1,115 --> 0:44:6,37
So, if we are in fear, we can attract a reflection of fear.


609
0:44:6,37 --> 0:44:11,96
The fear is a lack of being all powerful,


610
0:44:11,96 --> 0:44:16,35
and so being anything less than an infinite love puts us into a state of fear.


611
0:44:16,35 --> 0:44:21,176
One of first things we subject to is fear.


612
0:44:21,176 --> 0:44:25,349
"You can just fall over and hurt yourself." "I could bleed."


613
0:44:25,349 --> 0:44:30,755
"You don't want to put your hands in that pot, it's too hot."


614
0:44:30,755 --> 0:44:35,301
"There's sharks in the water." All those things - fear.


615
0:44:35,301 --> 0:44:41,812
And this is the greatest stick that anyone can give to controlling a human being.


616
0:44:41,812 --> 0:44:47,446
It's called slavery. Any other name you can call, but nonetheless,


617
0:44:47,446 --> 0:44:53,382
if a person does not have freedom, they have to become some sort of slave.


618
0:44:53,382 --> 0:44:57,248
What we don't want to become is slaves to the media.


619
0:44:57,248 --> 0:45:0,64
There is a machine that's pumping out every day.


620
0:45:0,64 --> 0:45:4,57
They say two things about the paper you can rely on, the newspaper:


621
0:45:4,57 --> 0:45:7,511
The price of the newspaper and the date.


622
0:45:7,511 --> 0:45:12,79
Those two things you can rely on, and then they say "You better check the date!"


623
0:45:12,79 --> 0:45:16,23
This is the way we become, our consciousness is controlled - we wake up


624
0:45:16,23 --> 0:45:17,682
in the morning the alarm goes,


625
0:45:17,682 --> 0:45:21,1
we have X amount of time before we have to be at work.


626
0:45:21,1 --> 0:45:22,943
We know if we leave a few minutes earlier


627
0:45:22,943 --> 0:45:25,15
we will probably have an easier traveling time.


628
0:45:25,15 --> 0:45:27,725
This is all fear. All of it is fear.


629
0:45:27,725 --> 0:45:30,489
I don't want to lose my job. If I lose my job, if I lose my house,


630
0:45:30,489 --> 0:45:33,531
my wife will leave me, my children... It's all fear.


631
0:45:33,531 --> 0:45:37,106
We all live in a world, which, take a step back, deep breath,


632
0:45:37,106 --> 0:45:41,174
look at it again, is utterly, bloody insane.


633
0:45:41,174 --> 0:45:44,532
And we are asked to believe, and so many people do,


634
0:45:44,532 --> 0:45:51,397
that we are somehow at the cutting edge of human evolution.


635
0:45:51,397 --> 0:45:57,169
We are nowhere near the edge of what is possible,


636
0:45:57,169 --> 0:45:59,523
and what is there to be known.


637
0:45:59,523 --> 0:46:3,974
But the norms are very powerful.


638
0:46:3,974 --> 0:46:10,119
Especially, when from cradle to grave, we are constantly manipulated


639
0:46:10,119 --> 0:46:14,404
and confused with contradictory information,


640
0:46:14,404 --> 0:46:16,53
and we are pressured to believe it,


641
0:46:16,53 --> 0:46:20,89
otherwise we get ridiculed or condemned for being different.


642
0:46:20,89 --> 0:46:25,87
"Just look at us. Everything is backwards, everything is upside down.


643
0:46:25,87 --> 0:46:31,607
Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge,


644
0:46:31,607 --> 0:46:35,557
governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information


645
0:46:35,557 --> 0:46:38,832
and religions destroy spirituality." - Michael Ellner.


646
0:46:38,832 --> 0:46:40,894
That is where we are!


647
0:46:40,894 --> 0:46:46,698
If you are tricked into fearing by the media


648
0:46:46,698 --> 0:46:50,503
and people talking of weapons of mass destruction,


649
0:46:50,503 --> 0:46:52,106
and all this over and over again,


650
0:46:52,106 --> 0:46:54,843
If you are tricked into going into the fear camp,


651
0:46:54,843 --> 0:46:59,43
then what is actually happening, you are relating to the universe


652
0:46:59,43 --> 0:47:3,452
through your ego, which is easily controlled and easily deceived.


653
0:47:3,452 --> 0:47:9,586
By keeping us involved with fear, it will be very difficult for us to,


654
0:47:9,586 --> 0:47:14,682
let's say, ascend - that's the popular word for that.


655
0:47:14,682 --> 0:47:19,406
The people who control our society, don't want us to go into bliss,


656
0:47:19,406 --> 0:47:24,357
because if our chakras and our Kundalini and other things were all awake,


657
0:47:24,357 --> 0:47:33,77
and we become more divine-conscious, as a super-conscious in awareness,


658
0:47:33,77 --> 0:47:35,684
they have no control of you.


659
0:47:35,684 --> 0:47:40,77
If there is nothing to fear except fear itself, and you drop that fear,


660
0:47:40,77 --> 0:47:41,876
then you have to be in bliss.


661
0:47:41,876 --> 0:47:47,322
If you choose love, the ego subsides,


662
0:47:47,322 --> 0:47:52,728
you wake up and start seeing the reality of what's really going on around you.


663
0:47:52,728 --> 0:47:59,878
The ego only has a very small vision of what actually is taking place and occurring,


664
0:47:59,878 --> 0:48:3,702
and an individual and an ego is very easily controlled,


665
0:48:3,702 --> 0:48:8,863
but a person who is awakening, a person who becomes enlightened,


666
0:48:8,863 --> 0:48:11,44
can't be controlled at all,


667
0:48:11,44 --> 0:48:15,614
in fact there is an old saying that an enlightened being plays with the universe


668
0:48:15,614 --> 0:48:18,705
the way that a child plays with a ball.


669
0:48:18,705 --> 0:48:21,479
Because they see the reality of everything,


670
0:48:21,479 --> 0:48:23,774
they can't be tricked, they can't be fooled.


671
0:48:23,774 --> 0:48:26,78
It's like a spell has been cast on the human mind,


672
0:48:26,78 --> 0:48:29,837
to disconnect us from the full magnitude of who we are,


673
0:48:29,837 --> 0:48:34,46
and the great news is the people who are in control of breaking that spell, is us -


674
0:48:34,46 --> 0:48:38,747
not some external force, us. It's just a choice.


675
0:48:38,747 --> 0:48:44,474
We are now at a time, a wonderful time, when balance is returning.


676
0:48:44,474 --> 0:48:52,545
You just have to have faith - to trust in love - to choose love and to trust in love.


677
0:48:52,545 --> 0:48:57,716
And that that will end up taking you into a much better place.


678
0:48:57,716 --> 0:49:4,231
If you continue to operate out of fear, and continue to operate through the ego,


679
0:49:4,231 --> 0:49:9,377
then you'll continue to be controlled and you'll continue to be scared,


680
0:49:9,377 --> 0:49:11,491
have the shit scared out of you,


681
0:49:11,491 --> 0:49:16,866
and you'll continue to not have a clue about what's going on in the world


682
0:49:16,866 --> 0:49:19,972
and around you, or even inside you for that matter.


683
0:49:19,972 --> 0:49:24,59
The more responsible we become for our actions,


684
0:49:24,59 --> 0:49:26,453
the more harmonious the world will be.


685
0:49:26,453 --> 0:49:32,612
As people begin to awaken and take on responsibility,


686
0:49:32,612 --> 0:49:36,0
we can expect to see a much more harmonious world.


687
0:49:36,0 --> 0:49:39,94
The main thing you have to fear is fear itself.


688
0:49:39,94 --> 0:49:47,287
If you get sucked into fear, it's going to put you out of harmony


689
0:49:47,287 --> 0:49:52,568
with actually what's happening, as opposed to part of what's happening.


690
0:49:52,568 --> 0:49:55,982
If you want to be a part of what's happening,


691
0:49:55,982 --> 0:50:1,113
then you will not obsess with fear.


692
0:50:1,113 --> 0:50:5,407
Governments destroy freedom. This is the great one.


693
0:50:5,407 --> 0:50:9,778
If, you know, people are new to this, this is the first big step:


694
0:50:9,778 --> 0:50:14,404
Governments are not there to serve the people - governments are there


695
0:50:14,404 --> 0:50:18,506
to serve those that control the governments and enslave the people -


696
0:50:18,506 --> 0:50:19,863
that's what they're there for!


697
0:50:19,863 --> 0:50:21,545
Once we realize that,


698
0:50:21,545 --> 0:50:31,596
then a lot of dots start to connect.


699
0:50:31,596 --> 0:50:36,592
"The very word "secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society;


700
0:50:36,592 --> 0:50:43,464
and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies,


701
0:50:43,464 --> 0:50:47,82
to secret oaths and to secret proceedings."


702
0:50:47,82 --> 0:50:50,622
"Its preparations are concealed, not published.


703
0:50:50,622 --> 0:50:54,53
Its mistakes are buried, not headlined.


704
0:50:54,53 --> 0:50:57,445
Its dissenters are silenced, not praised.


705
0:50:57,445 --> 0:51:1,1
No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed,


706
0:51:1,1 --> 0:51:3,327
no secret is revealed."


707
0:51:3,327 --> 0:51:9,79
"For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy


708
0:51:9,79 --> 0:51:15,117
that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence-


709
0:51:15,117 --> 0:51:21,839
on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections,


710
0:51:21,839 --> 0:51:25,618
on intimidation instead of free choice."


711
0:51:25,618 --> 0:51:31,326
"It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources


712
0:51:31,326 --> 0:51:37,744
into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military,


713
0:51:37,744 --> 0:51:48,162
diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations."


714
0:51:48,162 --> 0:51:52,865
It's supposed to be a hidden elite, which own and run the corporations,


715
0:51:52,865 --> 0:51:55,437
they own the banks, they own the media,


716
0:51:55,437 --> 0:51:59,714
so they have got total and absolute control of everything - just about.


717
0:51:59,714 --> 0:52:4,96
They control all the major important institutions of the world.


718
0:52:4,96 --> 0:52:11,471
They subvert organizations, they infiltrate organizations,


719
0:52:11,471 --> 0:52:16,197
they are very very active, they send spies all around the world.


720
0:52:16,197 --> 0:52:21,73
They hack our telephones and listen to our conversations-


721
0:52:21,73 --> 0:52:24,407
we are being spied on by these families.


722
0:52:24,407 --> 0:52:28,13
I'm talking about the real owners now, the real owners-


723
0:52:28,13 --> 0:52:30,802
the big wealthy business interest that control things


724
0:52:30,802 --> 0:52:32,586
and make all the important decisions.


725
0:52:32,586 --> 0:52:36,264
Forget the politicians - the politicians are put there to give you the idea


726
0:52:36,264 --> 0:52:39,395
that you have freedom of choice. You don't.


727
0:52:39,395 --> 0:52:44,912
You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything.


728
0:52:44,912 --> 0:52:48,923
They own all the important land, they own and control the corporations,


729
0:52:48,923 --> 0:52:51,162
they have long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress,


730
0:52:51,162 --> 0:52:54,27
the state houses, city halls, they have the judges in their back pocket,


731
0:52:54,27 --> 0:52:57,767
and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all the news


732
0:52:57,767 --> 0:53:1,123
and information you get to hear, they got you by the balls!


733
0:53:1,123 --> 0:53:8,159
They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying to get what they want.


734
0:53:8,159 --> 0:53:11,438
Well, we know what they want - they want more for themselves


735
0:53:11,438 --> 0:53:12,764
and less for everybody else.


736
0:53:12,764 --> 0:53:16,536
They are not in the spotlight, so to speak,


737
0:53:16,536 --> 0:53:21,502
they are not the world leaders that we see, but they are something behind that.


738
0:53:21,502 --> 0:53:26,639
Leaders come and go, don't they? They are always transient.


739
0:53:26,639 --> 0:53:30,158
But these people do not come and go, they're always there,


740
0:53:30,158 --> 0:53:36,163
and they run the cogs and machine at the highest level - over the ages.


741
0:53:36,163 --> 0:53:39,995
They go back a long, long, long way.


742
0:53:39,995 --> 0:53:45,92
And so they maintain their bloodlines and keep a lot of power and wealth,


743
0:53:45,92 --> 0:53:48,794
and as they inter-marry, they amass more wealth


744
0:53:48,794 --> 0:53:52,591
and more power - against other families.


745
0:53:52,591 --> 0:53:58,355
They own this fucking place, it's a big club, and you ain't in it!


746
0:53:58,355 --> 0:54:1,993
You and I are not in the big club.


747
0:54:1,993 --> 0:54:4,594
By the way it's the same big club that used to beat you over the head


748
0:54:4,594 --> 0:54:6,925
with all day long when they tell you what to believe,


749
0:54:6,925 --> 0:54:9,582
all day long beating you over the head in their media telling you what to believe,


750
0:54:9,582 --> 0:54:11,209
what to think and what to buy.


751
0:54:11,209 --> 0:54:16,268
The table is tilted folks, the game is rigged, and nobody seems to notice,


752
0:54:16,268 --> 0:54:18,442
nobody seems to care.


753
0:54:18,442 --> 0:54:20,123
Good, honest, hardworking people,


754
0:54:20,123 --> 0:54:22,964
white colour, blue colour - doesn't matter what colour shirt you have on.


755
0:54:22,964 --> 0:54:26,759
Good, honest, hardworking people continue, these are people of modest beings,


756
0:54:26,759 --> 0:54:31,407
continue to elect these rich cock suckers who don't give a fuck about them,


757
0:54:31,407 --> 0:54:34,36
they don't give a fuck about you, they don't give a fuck about you,


758
0:54:34,36 --> 0:54:39,305
they don't care about you, at all, at all, at all...


759
0:54:39,305 --> 0:54:42,76
These elite families call themselves, the Illuminati.


760
0:54:42,76 --> 0:54:48,105
Their symbols are always, you'll have an eye or a pyramid or something like that.


761
0:54:48,105 --> 0:54:50,508
that these are bad symbols, these are beautiful symbols


762
0:54:50,508 --> 0:54:54,35
but by using these beautiful symbols they have given them a bad name.


763
0:54:54,35 --> 0:54:59,524
So people associate the pentagram and the hexagram with satanic symbols,


764
0:54:59,524 --> 0:55:1,873
well they are not they are just nature symbols.


765
0:55:1,873 --> 0:55:6,117
We know you are ruthless, we know you are evil.


766
0:55:6,117 --> 0:55:9,626
To David Rockefeller, to the Rothschild representative here,


767
0:55:9,626 --> 0:55:12,776
to the queen of the Netherlands, to all of you.


768
0:55:12,776 --> 0:55:17,591
We tell you, you are not our queens, you are not our kings, you are not our Gods,


769
0:55:17,591 --> 0:55:19,212
we do not belong to you.


770
0:55:19,212 --> 0:55:23,827
We are not your slaves. We stand as free humans have stood since the beginning


771
0:55:23,827 --> 0:55:28,853
of time against the strong man, against the thugs, against the bullies.


772
0:55:28,853 --> 0:55:31,435
We will defeat your world government.


773
0:55:31,435 --> 0:55:35,686
The Illuminati are after world control. They want a New World Order.


774
0:55:35,686 --> 0:55:41,341
A New World Order, a world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle,


775
0:55:41,341 --> 0:55:44,431
governs the conduct of nations.


776
0:55:44,431 --> 0:55:47,784
When we are successful and we will be,


777
0:55:47,784 --> 0:55:50,855
we have a real chance at this New World Order.


778
0:55:50,855 --> 0:55:56,377
An order in which a credible united nations can use its peace-keeping role


779
0:55:56,377 --> 0:56:0,14
to fulfill the promise and vision of the UN's founders.


780
0:56:0,14 --> 0:56:2,1
I had planned another closing message,


781
0:56:2,1 --> 0:56:5,166
but I feel compelled to say what I am about to say.


782
0:56:5,166 --> 0:56:9,923
Now I risk sounding like a conspiracy theorist.


783
0:56:9,923 --> 0:56:15,669
But it's no longer a theory, what I am about to say is fact.


784
0:56:15,669 --> 0:56:20,273
The secret organizations of the world power elite are no longer secret.


785
0:56:20,273 --> 0:56:25,102
They have planned and are now leading us into a one world communist government.


786
0:56:25,102 --> 0:56:31,601
This is terrorism of the most worst kind, brought on you by our own government.


787
0:56:31,601 --> 0:56:34,511
And it's not going to be a nice New World Order.


788
0:56:34,511 --> 0:56:39,6
It's going to be a fascist dictatorship.


789
0:56:39,6 --> 0:56:44,333
It's going to be hell on earth. Martial law, concentration camps,


790
0:56:44,333 --> 0:56:46,179
but they just want their workers.


791
0:56:46,179 --> 0:56:50,896
They want a very very wealthy rich class and workers.


792
0:56:50,896 --> 0:56:56,667
No smart people, no bottom class, just slaves and them.


793
0:56:56,667 --> 0:56:58,617
But I will tell you what they don't want.


794
0:56:58,617 --> 0:57:2,319
They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.


795
0:57:2,319 --> 0:57:6,132
They don't want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking.


796
0:57:6,132 --> 0:57:7,351
They are not interested in that.


797
0:57:7,351 --> 0:57:10,564
That does not help them. That's against their interest.


798
0:57:10,564 --> 0:57:20,228
If a cow were to someday wake up out in the pasture and realize its fate.


799
0:57:20,228 --> 0:57:23,63
That it's going to end up in a McDonalds hamburger one day.


800
0:57:23,63 --> 0:57:28,168
If it had that understanding, do you think it continued to stay out there and eat grass?


801
0:57:28,168 --> 0:57:31,633
or do whatever the farmer wanted it to do. Hell no!


802
0:57:31,633 --> 0:57:36,182
But as long as that farmer can keep that cow in cow consciousness,


803
0:57:36,182 --> 0:57:38,11
that's not going to happen.


804
0:57:38,11 --> 0:57:41,915
They want to retain the status quo, the way things are,


805
0:57:41,915 --> 0:57:45,601
because they already have the control and so they want to maintain that.


806
0:57:45,601 --> 0:57:50,473
We hear about a whole lot of conspiracies and perhaps a lot of them are true.


807
0:57:50,473 --> 0:57:57,973
Like the idea of fluoride in your water, it affects the pineal gland.


808
0:57:57,973 --> 0:58:4,733
Perhaps that was a deliberate strategy in order to stop people rising their consciousness.


809
0:58:4,733 --> 0:58:8,761
I can give you a long list but you know the food we eat,


810
0:58:8,761 --> 0:58:16,29
the way we are educated, what we are told to believe, all of this plays a part.


811
0:58:16,29 --> 0:58:20,7
They keep us dumbed down. They keep us unaware.


812
0:58:20,7 --> 0:58:24,745
The world has been turned into a ‘maze of confusion’.


813
0:58:24,745 --> 0:58:31,294
And it’s done to keep us from the simple truths.


814
0:58:31,294 --> 0:58:40,645
Because complexity is there to stop us finding those simple truths.


815
0:58:40,645 --> 0:58:47,87
But when you connect the dots, between apparently unconnected people,


816
0:58:47,87 --> 0:58:57,89
situations, organizations, world events, you start to see how they fit together.


817
0:58:57,89 --> 0:59:1,432
Suddenly, this bewildering, confusing world


818
0:59:1,432 --> 0:59:8,22
starts to take on a much clearer dimension.


819
0:59:8,22 --> 0:59:12,315
Because, only by connecting the dots, over, as you will see today,


820
0:59:12,315 --> 0:59:19,193
a vast range of subjects and situations and people,


821
0:59:19,193 --> 0:59:23,433
can you start to see why the world is upside down.


822
0:59:23,433 --> 0:59:29,163
Why it is as it is, and crucially, behind that complexity,


823
0:59:29,163 --> 0:59:36,3
those smoke screens of complexity, is an amazing revelation


824
0:59:36,3 --> 0:59:40,423
of who we are and the nature of life.


825
0:59:40,423 --> 0:59:47,815
When we start to realize, that far from being Ethel Jones, or Billy Smith,


826
0:59:47,815 --> 0:59:52,541
we are ‘all that is, has been, and ever will be’.


827
0:59:52,541 --> 0:59:57,733
That is the difference between who we are,


828
0:59:57,733 --> 1:0:1,163
and who we are manipulated to believe we are.


829
1:0:1,163 --> 1:0:5,271
And obviously we are suffering from the effects of the dark ages,


830
1:0:5,271 --> 1:0:11,5
loss of consciousness and as we awaken in these days, which we are


831
1:0:11,5 --> 1:0:15,737
because the spiraling sun is taking us to greener pastures.


832
1:0:15,737 --> 1:0:24,32
I don't think the mainstream media wants everyone to realize


833
1:0:24,32 --> 1:0:29,7
that there is a mass awakening taking place.


834
1:0:29,7 --> 1:0:33,934
But yet everywhere I go and everything I see points to it.


835
1:0:33,934 --> 1:0:38,38
Everywhere I go there is this enormous amount of enthusiasm


836
1:0:38,38 --> 1:0:44,884
and interest in yoga, meditation, not just eastern things but philosophy.


837
1:0:44,884 --> 1:0:48,129
Workshops and things that are about self-awareness.


838
1:0:48,129 --> 1:0:53,327
People are opening their eyes and seeing what's been done to them.


839
1:0:53,327 --> 1:0:57,204
They are finally seeing that they have been sodomized for such a long time


840
1:0:57,204 --> 1:0:58,528
and they are not free.


841
1:0:58,528 --> 1:1:3,937
Just because we have got the freedom to choose what color milkshake


842
1:1:3,937 --> 1:1:8,47
we are going to have, what flavor, does not mean we are free.


843
1:1:8,47 --> 1:1:11,803
That's an illusion, you are not free, it's a police state.


844
1:1:11,803 --> 1:1:18,461
Now, people are waking up to that because they realize that it's just a service.


845
1:1:18,461 --> 1:1:21,956
The banks have a service and that service is war.


846
1:1:21,956 --> 1:1:26,311
The scientist and big pharma have a service and that is to drug you.


847
1:1:26,311 --> 1:1:29,594
Because drugs cost a lot of money and they want money.


848
1:1:29,594 --> 1:1:32,23
The governments are there to deceive you


849
1:1:32,23 --> 1:1:36,718
and to take money from you, via taxes.


850
1:1:36,718 --> 1:1:39,986
The world is turned upside down and people are confused


851
1:1:39,986 --> 1:1:43,643
and the reason this is happening is because of these Illuminati families.


852
1:1:43,643 --> 1:1:46,243
They have done this to us, its deception.


853
1:1:46,243 --> 1:1:50,593
Society has allowed itself to be dumbed down.


854
1:1:50,593 --> 1:1:56,886
I mean we are just as much to blame as they are for allowing it to happen.


855
1:1:56,886 --> 1:2:0,556
But unfortunately there is an awakening happening now


856
1:2:0,556 --> 1:2:2,475
and people are starting to wake up.


857
1:2:2,475 --> 1:2:5,539
People are becoming more conscious of the fact


858
1:2:5,539 --> 1:2:12,83
that we need to change our habits and improve and take responsibility.


859
1:2:12,83 --> 1:2:19,773
That force which is contracting awareness and consciousness,


860
1:2:19,773 --> 1:2:24,157
I think it's starting to get a little bit nervous and a little bit afraid.


861
1:2:24,157 --> 1:2:30,996
Its worried and because it seems like it's up scaling things.


862
1:2:30,996 --> 1:2:37,374
As this consciousness revolution is starting to occur,


863
1:2:37,374 --> 1:2:43,366
its upping the anti on its side of the scale too.


864
1:2:43,366 --> 1:2:48,187
It sees this awakening happening and its very threatened by it


865
1:2:48,187 --> 1:2:50,751
and it does not want it to happen.


866
1:2:50,751 --> 1:2:53,873
So greater and greater measures are taken.


867
1:2:53,873 --> 1:2:58,168
The elites and the power families realize that they are


868
1:2:58,168 --> 1:3:1,127
losing their grip on the system.


869
1:3:1,127 --> 1:3:3,132
The system is collapsing.


870
1:3:3,132 --> 1:3:8,647
So they naturally like every organism are trying to prolong their existence,


871
1:3:8,647 --> 1:3:14,67
therefore they try to keep fear out there and fear out there


872
1:3:14,67 --> 1:3:16,147
but a lot of people are just not buying into it


873
1:3:16,147 --> 1:3:21,895
and the reason being is because our sun is bringing us into the higher essences,


874
1:3:21,895 --> 1:3:26,221
the higher consciousness and therefore we refuse to go back,


875
1:3:26,221 --> 1:3:28,73
we can't, we can just climb up now.


876
1:3:28,73 --> 1:3:34,397
What was a kind of a willing complacent dumbing down,


877
1:3:34,397 --> 1:3:40,789
is now getting ready to turn into a big conflict between the forces in control


878
1:3:40,789 --> 1:3:43,478
who want to keep everybody as they were,


879
1:3:43,478 --> 1:3:48,75
and this consciousness revolution which can't possibly exist


880
1:3:48,75 --> 1:3:51,803
on that level now when their eyes are open.


881
1:3:51,803 --> 1:3:55,311
We don't need their services - war, drugs,


882
1:3:55,311 --> 1:3:59,96
terrorism comes from these people, it doesn't come from "terrorists"


883
1:3:59,96 --> 1:4:0,289
they are the terrorists.


884
1:4:0,289 --> 1:4:3,434
The Illuminati families are the terrorists.


885
1:4:3,434 --> 1:4:7,574
So, all these things and their services - let's just say NO.


886
1:4:7,574 --> 1:4:10,324
But, if you reject that, if you say no to that,


887
1:4:10,324 --> 1:4:16,127
and you say no I choose something better, I choose something higher,


888
1:4:16,127 --> 1:4:22,783
and you start refining yourself, you start living in love, instead of living in fear.


889
1:4:22,783 --> 1:4:26,748
And if enough people catch on and start doing that,


890
1:4:26,748 --> 1:4:31,698
then we'll turn the world into a garden of Eden again


891
1:4:31,698 --> 1:4:34,34
We will defeat your world government.


892
1:4:34,34 --> 1:4:40,38
I stand before the creator of the Universe, and I ask the creator of the Universe


893
1:4:40,38 --> 1:4:44,907
as our founding fathers did in 1776, to lead, guide and direct us


894
1:4:44,907 --> 1:4:49,23
and to give us the power, and the foresight, and the understanding


895
1:4:49,23 --> 1:4:52,181
and the will to stand against your entire agenda,


896
1:4:52,181 --> 1:4:57,4
including, your final plan of world population reduction of 80%.


897
1:4:57,4 --> 1:5:2,593
Why do you put mercury in the vaccines, stannic sodium fluoride in the water? Why?


898
1:5:2,593 --> 1:5:5,347
Why do you put cancer viruses in the vaccines,


899
1:5:5,347 --> 1:5:9,594
why have you used depleted uranium now in four separate nations,


900
1:5:9,594 --> 1:5:13,484
you're arrogant, you have the sickness the elites have had throughout the history.


901
1:5:13,484 --> 1:5:19,31
Darker forces really fear a man who is in touch with his own truth


902
1:5:19,31 --> 1:5:21,878
and is dictated by that,


903
1:5:21,878 --> 1:5:24,748
because they can't control you anymore.


904
1:5:24,748 --> 1:5:31,63
Well, they could very well lose their power base by us becoming awakened,


905
1:5:31,63 --> 1:5:37,754
and so, in order to keep us under control, they promote an agenda of fear.


906
1:5:37,754 --> 1:5:42,93
They are reacting to it because in fact they are afraid.


907
1:5:42,93 --> 1:5:46,723
The Illuminati are afraid of losing all their power,


908
1:5:46,723 --> 1:5:53,395
when 2012 arrives, they know that the energy grid, the evil, negative energy grid


909
1:5:53,395 --> 1:5:56,952
which sustains them, won't be there to support them.


910
1:5:56,952 --> 1:6:1,623
They are standing in the front of a tidal wave saying "I'm not gonna get wet."


911
1:6:1,623 --> 1:6:2,948
They're gonna get wet.


912
1:6:2,948 --> 1:6:7,203
And they're gonna get affected by this consciousness shift too - whether they like it or not.


913
1:6:7,203 --> 1:6:11,102
Our concern is not to worry about the Illuminati at this stage,


914
1:6:11,102 --> 1:6:18,569
our concern is to imbue our lives with bliss and love, because their time is up.


915
1:6:18,569 --> 1:6:20,868
It's over and that's obvious.


916
1:6:20,868 --> 1:6:24,247
It's obvious to the awakened masses now.


917
1:6:24,247 --> 1:6:29,462
They're running for the hills, desperately trying to cling on to their empire,


918
1:6:29,462 --> 1:6:33,501
but we can conquer these, like David conquered Goliath,


919
1:6:33,501 --> 1:6:36,818
by standing up - making a stand, responsibly.


920
1:6:36,818 --> 1:6:40,204
You will and you are failing now.


921
1:6:40,204 --> 1:6:45,872
Your New World Order will fall. Humanity will defeat you.


922
1:6:45,872 --> 1:6:48,105
John F. Kennedy: "Confident that with your help


923
1:6:48,105 --> 1:7:1,523
man will be what he was born to be: free and independent."


924
1:7:1,523 --> 1:7:8,263
There is only one of us experiencing a fractal holographic experience of itself.


925
1:7:8,263 --> 1:7:10,282
Each one of those individuations,


926
1:7:10,282 --> 1:7:16,242
no matter how infinitesimal has got the entire whole within itself.


927
1:7:16,242 --> 1:7:21,79
There is this illusion that were are something else,


928
1:7:21,79 --> 1:7:26,114
but in truth all we are is consciousness observing the manifestations


929
1:7:26,114 --> 1:7:29,412
of consciousness - dance before our eyes.


930
1:7:29,412 --> 1:7:34,794
We are all the same person, watching ourselves from different viewpoints,


931
1:7:34,794 --> 1:7:38,281
from different attitudes, from different environments.


932
1:7:38,281 --> 1:7:41,973
Everything in creation is the same energy, and energy is consciousness.


933
1:7:41,973 --> 1:7:43,75
Energy = Consciousness.


934
1:7:43,75 --> 1:7:46,14
So we are looking at creation being one gigantic consciousness,


935
1:7:46,14 --> 1:7:49,178
one gigantic mind, of which we are all part,


936
1:7:49,178 --> 1:7:52,824
so we're like droplets of water in an ocean of consciousness.


937
1:7:52,824 --> 1:7:56,515
We're individual to a certain extent, but all together we make up the whole.


938
1:7:56,515 --> 1:8:2,77
There's nothing to do in this world of bamboo, but everyone needs a hobby.


939
1:8:2,77 --> 1:8:6,757
You're just here to experience, you're having a good time, right?


940
1:8:6,757 --> 1:8:11,244
But the illusion that we put ourselves into,


941
1:8:11,244 --> 1:8:14,546
can be so powerful, that we can get lost in it.


942
1:8:14,546 --> 1:8:20,835
Every human being is God himself, but he does not understand his true self


943
1:8:20,835 --> 1:8:24,405
and he's constantly engulfed by the influence of his mind,


944
1:8:24,405 --> 1:8:27,373
his intellect, which we call as the great delusion.


945
1:8:27,373 --> 1:8:30,562
He's constantly driven by this great delusion.


946
1:8:30,562 --> 1:8:34,291
The world is like a ride in the amusement park, and when you choose to go on,


947
1:8:34,291 --> 1:8:36,76
you think it's real, because that's how powerful our minds are,


948
1:8:36,76 --> 1:8:39,212
and the ride goes up and down, and round, and round.


949
1:8:39,212 --> 1:8:42,551
It has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly coloured, and it's very loud,


950
1:8:42,551 --> 1:8:44,776
and it's fun for a while.


951
1:8:44,776 --> 1:8:47,261
Some people have been on the ride for a long time


952
1:8:47,261 --> 1:8:50,793
and they begin to question - is this real or is it just a ride?


953
1:8:50,793 --> 1:8:53,64
And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and they say


954
1:8:53,64 --> 1:8:58,897
"Hey, don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride,


955
1:8:58,897 --> 1:9:2,716
and we... kill those people."


956
1:9:2,716 --> 1:9:8,484
"Shut him up! We have a lot invested in this ride, Shut him up!!"


957
1:9:8,484 --> 1:9:12,4
Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account


958
1:9:12,4 --> 1:9:15,823
and my family - this has to be real."


959
1:9:15,823 --> 1:9:17,937
It's just a ride.


960
1:9:17,937 --> 1:9:23,724
The one energy wishes to experience itself.


961
1:9:23,724 --> 1:9:31,62
But, when it's in the oneness, it cannot experience itself,


962
1:9:31,62 --> 1:9:33,121
it only knows it as a concept.


963
1:9:33,121 --> 1:9:37,775
And so, it does the next best thing - it forgets what it is.


964
1:9:37,775 --> 1:9:41,199
By deliberately forgetting what and who you are,


965
1:9:41,199 --> 1:9:46,29
you can have the experience of remembering.


966
1:9:46,29 --> 1:9:56,308
We are consciousness. Disembodied, no-form awareness, having an experience.


967
1:9:56,308 --> 1:9:59,374
Like a central American shaman said,


968
1:9:59,374 --> 1:10:6,116
"We are perceivers, we are awareness; we are not objects; we have no solidity.


969
1:10:6,116 --> 1:10:8,983
We, or rather our reason, forget this


970
1:10:8,983 --> 1:10:12,581
and thus we entrap the totality of ourselves in a vicious circle


971
1:10:12,581 --> 1:10:15,118
from which we rarely emerge in our lifetime."


972
1:10:15,118 --> 1:10:19,68
And that vicious circle is what the control system wants to keep us in,


973
1:10:19,68 --> 1:10:21,343
cause then we are controllable!


974
1:10:21,343 --> 1:10:27,321
When we say I'm doing some kind of spiritual practice or following spirituality,


975
1:10:27,321 --> 1:10:30,269
what it means is I'm actually finding out who I am.


976
1:10:30,269 --> 1:10:33,967
What am I? Who am I? Where did I come from?


977
1:10:33,967 --> 1:10:38,963
What am I doing here on this Earth? And where will I go?


978
1:10:38,963 --> 1:10:44,496
You're actually demystifying these concepts yourself, by realizing who you are.


979
1:10:44,496 --> 1:10:49,669
Eventually you will get to the point where you will probably experience


980
1:10:49,669 --> 1:10:55,271
the truth of who you really are as opposed to the illusion that you believe you are.


981
1:10:55,271 --> 1:11:0,74
You believe you are this physical body, you believe you are your thoughts or whatever.


982
1:11:0,74 --> 1:11:5,15
The truth of it is, you're the source of all those things - you're the source of your thoughts,


983
1:11:5,15 --> 1:11:9,529
you're the source of your body, you're the source of all your emotions.


984
1:11:9,529 --> 1:11:13,113
You're the place from which all that comes,


985
1:11:13,113 --> 1:11:19,661
but we've been tricked into believing, for whatever reason, that we are these things.


986
1:11:19,661 --> 1:11:25,327
But we're not these things, we're actually the creator of those things.


987
1:11:25,327 --> 1:11:30,772
We are nothing short of divine. We are undifferentiated consciousness.


988
1:11:30,772 --> 1:11:36,574
As we remember who we are, and acquiring more powers,


989
1:11:36,574 --> 1:11:44,633
we are learning that we are co-creators in this experience and what is about to happen.


990
1:11:44,633 --> 1:11:49,751
Enlightenment really means - you become aware what you really are,


991
1:11:49,751 --> 1:11:54,256
you become aware that you are one with God, and that you are God.


992
1:11:54,256 --> 1:11:58,601
Well, like a drop is to an ocean - you put a drop of water into the ocean


993
1:11:58,601 --> 1:12:1,451
and it becomes the ocean - well, that's what we are.


994
1:12:1,451 --> 1:12:9,502
are units of divinity. We are deific atoms - units of God.


995
1:12:9,502 --> 1:12:13,309
And that's what the scriptures say - we are the sons of God.


996
1:12:13,309 --> 1:12:16,298
In that sense - so it's beautiful!


997
1:12:16,298 --> 1:12:23,832
Far from being worthless, we are unique and vital droplets in this ocean


998
1:12:23,832 --> 1:12:26,82
of consciousness that we call God or creation,


999
1:12:26,82 --> 1:12:30,475
this God, as we call it - it's not some guy with a beard sitting in a throne saying


1000
1:12:30,475 --> 1:12:32,415
"You've sinned and you shall be punished",


1001
1:12:32,415 --> 1:12:36,646
or something out there - it's actually within us, it's around us,


1002
1:12:36,646 --> 1:12:38,82
it is everything, it is the consciousness,


1003
1:12:38,82 --> 1:12:43,103
that is expressing itself in all the variety of forms that we see.


1004
1:12:43,103 --> 1:12:47,21
Obviously, we are at a different level of consciousness to a wall,


1005
1:12:47,21 --> 1:12:53,117
but the wall is still God, at a different level of consciousness it's still the same whole.


1006
1:12:53,117 --> 1:12:57,316
Doesn't matter which race culture everyone is confined to,


1007
1:12:57,316 --> 1:13:1,452
but the same God which resides in me - resides in everyone.


1008
1:13:1,452 --> 1:13:6,797
And when one realizes the God within us, he can see the God within everyone.


1009
1:13:6,797 --> 1:13:9,775
You never see positive drug stories on the news, do you?


1010
1:13:9,775 --> 1:13:12,161
Isn't that weird, since most of the experiences I've had on drugs,


1011
1:13:12,161 --> 1:13:15,683
were real fucking positive.


1012
1:13:15,683 --> 1:13:18,208
Who are these morons they're finding  that's what I want to know.


1013
1:13:18,208 --> 1:13:21,843
How about a positive LSD-story, wouldn't that be news-worthy, just once,


1014
1:13:21,843 --> 1:13:26,691
to base your decision on information, rather than scare-tactics and superstitions,


1015
1:13:26,691 --> 1:13:33,401
and lies? Just once. I think it would be news-worthy.


1016
1:13:33,401 --> 1:13:37,849
Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed


1017
1:13:37,849 --> 1:13:41,805
to a slow vibration, that we're all one consciousness


1018
1:13:41,805 --> 1:13:44,854
experiencing it self-subjectively.


1019
1:13:44,854 --> 1:13:47,968
There's no such thing as death, life is only a dream,


1020
1:13:47,968 --> 1:13:52,66
and we are the imagination of ourselves.


1021
1:13:52,66 --> 1:13:54,48
Here's Tom with the weather.


1022
1:13:54,48 --> 1:13:59,525
The body is the way our awareness experiences this reality.


1023
1:13:59,525 --> 1:14:5,567
If I want to interact with this reality, which is a frequency range,


1024
1:14:5,567 --> 1:14:10,468
I have to have an outer shell, we all do, that vibrates within this frequency range,


1025
1:14:10,468 --> 1:14:15,43
cause our consciousness is vibrating much too quickly - it's like radio 1


1026
1:14:15,43 --> 1:14:17,573
trying to make a connection with radio 2,


1027
1:14:17,573 --> 1:14:19,687
on different wave lengths, it's never gonna happen.


1028
1:14:19,687 --> 1:14:23,379
So we take on this outer projection we call our body,


1029
1:14:23,379 --> 1:14:28,468
and therefore I can pick this up and interact with this reality.


1030
1:14:28,468 --> 1:14:32,974
What the control system wants us to do, is to believe that projection,


1031
1:14:32,974 --> 1:14:36,209
that vehicle to experience this reality is who we are,


1032
1:14:36,209 --> 1:14:39,28
cause then we go from "I am all that is, has been and ever will be,


1033
1:14:39,28 --> 1:14:43,621
I'm Charley Smith, I'm Ethel Jones, I've got no power."


1034
1:14:43,621 --> 1:14:45,113
It's the whole bottom line of it!


1035
1:14:45,113 --> 1:14:50,387
The United States has two satellites, they're called GOES.


1036
1:14:50,387 --> 1:14:54,988
The role of these satellites is to measure the magnetic fields of the earth


1037
1:14:54,988 --> 1:14:57,354
and send back readings every 30 minutes,


1038
1:14:57,354 --> 1:15:0,866
and those readings normally fall within a certain range of data


1039
1:15:0,866 --> 1:15:3,479
that scientists are used to seeing.


1040
1:15:3,479 --> 1:15:8,95
Well, it was in September of 2001, that scientists began


1041
1:15:8,95 --> 1:15:11,489
to see some readings that were off the map, just off the scale


1042
1:15:11,489 --> 1:15:13,599
compared to what they had seen in the past.


1043
1:15:13,599 --> 1:15:16,447
Then they said, what is happening, what is it that could be influencing


1044
1:15:16,447 --> 1:15:20,1
the magnetic fields of the entire planet


1045
1:15:20,1 --> 1:15:22,62
to such a degree that we're seeing those big spikes.


1046
1:15:22,62 --> 1:15:48,37
That our satellites are seeing, that we never seen these before.


1047
1:15:48,37 --> 1:15:54,728
They overlaid the data from the satellites onto a calendar of months and days,


1048
1:15:54,728 --> 1:15:59,304
and long behold what they found, is that the spike was occurring precisely


1049
1:15:59,304 --> 1:16:5,278
during the time of September 11th 2001, and even more precisely


1050
1:16:5,278 --> 1:16:10,158
that the first spike occurred 15 minutes after the first plane


1051
1:16:10,158 --> 1:16:12,693
hit the first tower in the World Trade Center.


1052
1:16:12,693 --> 1:16:18,94
Now, the reason this is so important to a scientist is because for 300 years


1053
1:16:18,94 --> 1:16:21,757
our science have been based on two false assumptions.


1054
1:16:21,757 --> 1:16:25,924
The first false assumption is that "Everything is separate from everything else,


1055
1:16:25,924 --> 1:16:29,106
that what happens in one place has no effect on what happens anywhere else,


1056
1:16:29,106 --> 1:16:31,965
and if it looks like it does, it's only a coincidence."


1057
1:16:31,965 --> 1:16:36,768
The second false assumption: "Our inner experiences - of thought, feeling, emotion


1058
1:16:36,768 --> 1:16:39,944
and belief have no effect on the world beyond our bodies."


1059
1:16:39,944 --> 1:16:45,324
Based on those two false assumptions, that had been accepted for 300 years by scientists,


1060
1:16:45,324 --> 1:16:49,849
I can see why there would be a disconnect when they're looking at


1061
1:16:49,849 --> 1:16:55,934
magnetic fields of the Earth, spiking precisely the moment the human emotion


1062
1:16:55,934 --> 1:16:58,46
of the planet is focused on a disaster.


1063
1:16:58,46 --> 1:17:3,1
We live here in Australia, and recently there were two cyclones


1064
1:17:3,1 --> 1:17:6,414
in the same year in northern Queensland.


1065
1:17:6,414 --> 1:17:10,937
What I noticed when we went and looked on the weather station, on the weather channel,


1066
1:17:10,937 --> 1:17:15,384
is the men and women who are telling the public about that thing,


1067
1:17:15,384 --> 1:17:19,949
they're saying it could generate into a much bigger storm.


1068
1:17:19,949 --> 1:17:22,767
And, so, what's called Focused Human Attention,


1069
1:17:22,767 --> 1:17:29,515
is that they drew everyone's mind into the idea that this is going to


1070
1:17:29,515 --> 1:17:33,268
generate into a much bigger storm.


1071
1:17:33,268 --> 1:17:34,731
And that's what they kept saying.


1072
1:17:34,731 --> 1:17:41,598
Until, Focused Human Attention on the storm made it grow bigger.


1073
1:17:41,598 --> 1:17:45,932
Now, if we thinking that's not true, then we have to take a look at this gentlemen


1074
1:17:45,932 --> 1:17:53,26
who's getting some vessel of water, and he says "Love" and puts a little label "Love",


1075
1:17:53,26 --> 1:17:56,152
and the molecular structure all goes into harmony.


1076
1:17:56,152 --> 1:18:0,215
And then he gets the same water, puts in a different vessel, puts "Hate",


1077
1:18:0,215 --> 1:18:3,141
and everything goes into chaos and stress.


1078
1:18:3,141 --> 1:18:6,976
In actual fact in a scientific basis now, if a person,


1079
1:18:6,976 --> 1:18:9,71
a scientist is carrying out an experiment,


1080
1:18:9,71 --> 1:18:13,246
he has to leave the building, the area - everything.


1081
1:18:13,246 --> 1:18:18,63
Because his consciousness is going to affect the outcome of the experiment.


1082
1:18:18,63 --> 1:18:22,271
So they now have to carry it out when he is not around,


1083
1:18:22,271 --> 1:18:26,187
to get a true result scientifically.


1084
1:18:26,187 --> 1:18:31,393
Thoughts are very powerful. If it is a positive thought,


1085
1:18:31,393 --> 1:18:38,194
it will travel to the positive collective, if you send out a negative thought,


1086
1:18:38,194 --> 1:18:42,434
it will travel to the negative collective around the world,


1087
1:18:42,434 --> 1:18:45,576
and it will have a negative effect on the planet.


1088
1:18:45,576 --> 1:18:50,594
Almost universally ancient texts and traditions have reminded us


1089
1:18:50,594 --> 1:18:55,154
that we are connected - they've said that we are one, that we are part of our world,


1090
1:18:55,154 --> 1:18:58,563
that we are part of one another, that we're part of the Earth and the changes in the Earth.


1091
1:18:58,563 --> 1:19:4,342
And, what I found is, over the last 22 years as I've travelled nearly


1092
1:19:4,342 --> 1:19:6,346
every continent of the Earth, and spoken to people from


1093
1:19:6,346 --> 1:19:11,492
so many different traditions and cultures, is that people really want to believe that,


1094
1:19:11,492 --> 1:19:14,705
they want to believe and they like to believe that we're truly connected,


1095
1:19:14,705 --> 1:19:17,3
but they need a reason for that belief.


1096
1:19:17,3 --> 1:19:23,487
Science is now giving us that reason - for our logical mind, to make the connection,


1097
1:19:23,487 --> 1:19:27,33
to see how we are related and how we influence the world,


1098
1:19:27,33 --> 1:19:31,151
and how by honoring that connection through our hearts,


1099
1:19:31,151 --> 1:19:35,607
we literally have the power to influence the very fields of this planet


1100
1:19:35,607 --> 1:19:39,263
to sustain life in the world, sustain the health,


1101
1:19:39,263 --> 1:19:41,442
the healing and the well being of our bodies,


1102
1:19:41,442 --> 1:19:43,689
and it's all about the magnetic fields of the Earth.


1103
1:19:43,689 --> 1:19:48,173
In Washington DC, people from all over the world came there to meditate,


1104
1:19:48,173 --> 1:19:53,467
and the crime rate dropped dramatically during that time,


1105
1:19:53,467 --> 1:20:0,173
proportionally to the amount of people who were meditating - in exact proportion.


1106
1:20:0,173 --> 1:20:9,87
I work very hard here in this center, to keep the vibrational rate of this room


1107
1:20:9,87 --> 1:20:12,107
at a very high frequency.


1108
1:20:12,107 --> 1:20:19,871
Now, it's to the point where people who don't even have an interest in meditation,


1109
1:20:19,871 --> 1:20:23,91
come here into this room, there was one person who spent a night


1110
1:20:23,91 --> 1:20:29,319
not that long ago, had no interest in meditation and that sort of thing whatsoever,


1111
1:20:29,319 --> 1:20:34,32
and a Kundalini awakened in the morning.


1112
1:20:34,32 --> 1:20:36,992
He had no understanding of that at all,


1113
1:20:36,992 --> 1:20:39,273
he had never even heard the word before.


1114
1:20:39,273 --> 1:20:46,592
And so, just by being in an environment which is kept pure, that happened.


1115
1:20:46,592 --> 1:20:53,606
Now, take that on a larger scale - if we were as a society - to do that


1116
1:20:53,606 --> 1:20:57,858
to the whole planet, then your wildest imagination


1117
1:20:57,858 --> 1:21:2,441
couldn't conceive of what is possible in such a scenario.


1118
1:21:2,441 --> 1:21:6,13
A person who sits there and meditates quietly,


1119
1:21:6,13 --> 1:21:11,341
in very, very strong gravity - they set up a gravity field,


1120
1:21:11,341 --> 1:21:14,818
that they're not moving no matter if the building falls down.


1121
1:21:14,818 --> 1:21:18,554
They can counter-act the negative effect of many.


1122
1:21:18,554 --> 1:21:27,526
A person who is in a negative space, walks into a room with ordinary people,


1123
1:21:27,526 --> 1:21:32,587
immediately, the level of energy will come down


1124
1:21:32,587 --> 1:21:38,128
and people won't know exactly what it is or why it is that happened, but it happens,


1125
1:21:38,128 --> 1:21:43,676
same thing happens the other way around too - you get a bunch of people bitching


1126
1:21:43,676 --> 1:21:49,36
and complaining in a group


1127
1:21:49,36 --> 1:21:54,544
and one person who's just in an amazing space of consciousness comes in


1128
1:21:54,544 --> 1:21:56,614
and the next thing you know the whole group is laughing,


1129
1:21:56,614 --> 1:21:59,277
enjoying themselves, having a good time.


1130
1:21:59,277 --> 1:22:5,382
Consciousness changes, generally speaking, because of realization,


1131
1:22:5,382 --> 1:22:9,766
however, when we're talking about collective consciousness, that is changed by media.


1132
1:22:9,766 --> 1:22:13,426
From channel to channel, on the news, and on dramas,


1133
1:22:13,426 --> 1:22:16,65
and on every other program,


1134
1:22:16,65 --> 1:22:21,475
and all it is - is brainwashing and demonization.


1135
1:22:21,475 --> 1:22:25,74
Generally a human being is bombarded with unwanted thoughts


1136
1:22:25,74 --> 1:22:30,63
constantly during the day, which depletes his mental energies.


1137
1:22:30,63 --> 1:22:35,712
When one is depleted with mental energy, it causes what you call


1138
1:22:35,712 --> 1:22:41,321
a drain of one's own mental resources and drain of just our physical energy as such.


1139
1:22:41,321 --> 1:22:45,491
Due to which our ability to comprehend and think reduces,


1140
1:22:45,491 --> 1:22:48,233
our efficiency as a human being reduces as well.


1141
1:22:48,233 --> 1:22:52,994
But, when you do something spiritual and associated with spirituality,


1142
1:22:52,994 --> 1:22:56,389
you're constantly gaining positive energy,


1143
1:22:56,389 --> 1:23:0,742
so the ability for personality defects manifests less.


1144
1:23:0,742 --> 1:23:6,151
The worst weapon in the world is the Television.


1145
1:23:6,151 --> 1:23:11,176
And the reason is - it's not the cameras fault, it's done in the editing process.


1146
1:23:11,176 --> 1:23:14,514
It's done in the voice-over, in the treatment.


1147
1:23:14,514 --> 1:23:18,122
The camera doesn't tell a lie, it only ever tells the truth.


1148
1:23:18,122 --> 1:23:21,762
Where the problem with the collective consciousness is - unless it's focused,


1149
1:23:21,762 --> 1:23:25,17
Focused Human Attention in the right mood


1150
1:23:25,17 --> 1:23:30,934
you may as well be on the battlefield, saying I'm French.


1151
1:23:30,934 --> 1:23:33,165
And the other goes on - I'm British.


1152
1:23:33,165 --> 1:23:38,937
Hold on, we better all pray to our God, and then we better kill each other.


1153
1:23:38,937 --> 1:23:41,208
See? This is called collective consciousness.


1154
1:23:41,208 --> 1:23:45,667
The individual consciousness is gone. He fled the battlefield, he didn't want to know.


1155
1:23:45,667 --> 1:23:52,385
Individual people by themselves, groups, societies,


1156
1:23:52,385 --> 1:23:56,845
the mood of the whole planet - can all be altered,


1157
1:23:56,845 --> 1:24:3,404
can all be changed and the reason for that is - because the planet, group's, societies


1158
1:24:3,404 --> 1:24:5,42
aren't what they appear to be.


1159
1:24:5,42 --> 1:24:11,754
They are just another level consciousness. We are all consciousness.


1160
1:24:11,754 --> 1:24:17,95
If consciousness changes to a higher vibration, which, I feel, is happening in 2012,


1161
1:24:17,95 --> 1:24:24,356
then the society, the way we know it now, will not be there anymore.


1162
1:24:24,356 --> 1:24:28,791
The old has to go. The new has to come.


1163
1:24:28,791 --> 1:24:35,501
I don't feel that one thing is going to evolve independently of another.


1164
1:24:35,501 --> 1:24:44,904
I feel that in this field of consciousness we live in, things operate in an uniform way


1165
1:24:44,904 --> 1:24:49,628
and we are now passing through a period,


1166
1:24:49,628 --> 1:24:55,71
in which an acceleration of consciousness is taking place.


1167
1:24:55,71 --> 1:25:2,743
Everybody is benefiting from these finer conscious levels that we are arriving at,


1168
1:25:2,743 --> 1:25:6,91
simply by means of where the Sun is taking us.


1169
1:25:6,91 --> 1:25:10,8
The earth itself is a conscious living entity,


1170
1:25:10,8 --> 1:25:16,762
and if the beings living on it choose to raise their frequency,


1171
1:25:16,762 --> 1:25:21,552
they choose to live in love as opposed to fear.


1172
1:25:21,552 --> 1:25:29,733
The plants will grow greener, the oxygen in the air will replenish,


1173
1:25:29,733 --> 1:25:36,837
the pollution will start to disappear - it'll turn literally into a utopia - heaven on Earth.


1174
1:25:36,837 --> 1:25:41,847
It's up to our focused attention to create that reality,


1175
1:25:41,847 --> 1:25:47,703
but we have to become aware of who's meddling in our minds.


1176
1:25:47,703 --> 1:25:51,118
Our mind is our biggest problem when it's not under our control.


1177
1:25:51,118 --> 1:25:52,688
Under OUR control.


1178
1:25:52,688 --> 1:25:59,465
Somehow we have this wrong idea that we have to do that by going out there and building it.


1179
1:25:59,465 --> 1:26:3,703
You don't go out there to build it, you go in here to build it.


1180
1:26:3,703 --> 1:26:9,921
You find it in here first, and just allow it to radiate out around you.


1181
1:26:9,921 --> 1:26:14,152
And everything else then naturally happens by itself.


1182
1:26:14,152 --> 1:26:20,607
As people begin to awaken and take on responsibility,


1183
1:26:20,607 --> 1:26:23,313
we can expect to see a much more harmonious world.


1184
1:26:23,313 --> 1:26:27,865
It's just a ride. And we can change it anytime we want.


1185
1:26:27,865 --> 1:26:31,771
It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money,


1186
1:26:31,771 --> 1:26:44,227
a choice right now, between FEAR and LOVE.


1187
1:26:44,227 --> 1:26:47,888
What society would probably like for us to believe is love is like


1188
1:26:47,888 --> 1:26:50,69
what we see on the Hollywood films.


1189
1:26:50,69 --> 1:26:53,19
Love is actually a state of being.


1190
1:26:53,19 --> 1:26:56,975
It's not actually something that you do to somebody else.


1191
1:26:56,975 --> 1:27:2,883
If someone loves you and you don't feel love for them, you don't feel anything.


1192
1:27:2,883 --> 1:27:10,205
You only feel love when you are radiating love, when you are giving love.


1193
1:27:10,205 --> 1:27:14,15
If you love yourself, you feel better in yourself.


1194
1:27:14,15 --> 1:27:19,636
If you hate yourself, you loathe yourself. And why do you wanna do that?


1195
1:27:19,636 --> 1:27:24,693
Why do you wanna be miserable? Why do you wanna feel bad? Is that good for you?


1196
1:27:24,693 --> 1:27:29,204
The worry is just another prayer for what you don't want.


1197
1:27:29,204 --> 1:27:34,804
If you want to create what you DO want, focus on the, let's say grandest vision


1198
1:27:34,804 --> 1:27:37,551
of the highest version you could possibly imagine.


1199
1:27:37,551 --> 1:27:42,326
If you're gonna do anything, make sure you are doing it out of joy and not fear.


1200
1:27:42,326 --> 1:27:45,473
If you feel negative, you have no energy,


1201
1:27:45,473 --> 1:27:50,187
if you feel positive, you have much more energy, and you can do a lot of things,


1202
1:27:50,187 --> 1:27:52,296
you can help many people and yourself.


1203
1:27:52,296 --> 1:27:56,981
To choose to love over fear is choosing a state of awareness,


1204
1:27:56,981 --> 1:28:4,79
a state of consciousness to exist in, to be in as your reality.


1205
1:28:4,79 --> 1:28:10,124
And even when the dark forces come along and try to draw you out of it,


1206
1:28:10,124 --> 1:28:15,286
you still love them. Of course, they really hate it when you do that.


1207
1:28:15,286 --> 1:28:25,36
And all it is, like everything else, is a choice - a choice between fear and love.


1208
1:28:25,36 --> 1:28:27,643
That's all it is!


1209
1:28:27,643 --> 1:28:35,814
We can choose to be frightened. We can choose to hate. Just a choice.


1210
1:28:35,814 --> 1:28:41,688
Or we can choose not to fear and we can choose to love.


1211
1:28:41,688 --> 1:28:45,741
Not love on the basis "I love you if I fancy you darling",


1212
1:28:45,741 --> 1:28:49,436
but I love you because you exist.


1213
1:28:49,436 --> 1:28:53,191
I love you whatever. I love you without condition.


1214
1:28:53,191 --> 1:28:57,651
As the loving component grows,


1215
1:28:57,651 --> 1:29:0,905
that becomes more and more contagious, if you like,


1216
1:29:0,905 --> 1:29:5,575
and the world tends to become a more loving place, as a result.


1217
1:29:5,575 --> 1:29:10,303
The critical mass of the love paradigm grows.


1218
1:29:10,303 --> 1:29:17,32
And if you want to change the world, it has to start with self.


1219
1:29:17,32 --> 1:29:20,755
Fear, anger, hatred, condemnation,


1220
1:29:20,755 --> 1:29:25,789
dictating what other people should be - that's the world we got.


1221
1:29:25,789 --> 1:29:27,854
That's the prison.


1222
1:29:27,854 --> 1:29:29,741
But Paradise is waiting.


1223
1:29:29,741 --> 1:29:35,91
It's a thought, an attitude away, that's all it is, it's a choice away. Love.


1224
1:29:35,91 --> 1:29:38,916
We love each other, and love the world,


1225
1:29:38,916 --> 1:29:41,132
our lives are fundamentally changed,


1226
1:29:41,132 --> 1:29:43,312
and the world is fundamentally changed.


1227
1:29:43,312 --> 1:29:46,481
And we are the generations, strange as it may seem


1228
1:29:46,481 --> 1:29:49,346
when you survey the world today - we are the generations,


1229
1:29:49,346 --> 1:29:52,774
I passionately believe, who are gonna love the world


1230
1:29:52,774 --> 1:29:57,931
into the paradise it really should be, and was always designed to be.


1231
1:29:57,931 --> 1:30:1,14
Human beings actually are supposed to be eternal,


1232
1:30:1,14 --> 1:30:5,955
full of knowledge and full of ecstasy and I'm not talking about the pill,


1233
1:30:5,955 --> 1:30:10,512
I'm talking about spiritual bliss, which is the highest frequency,


1234
1:30:10,512 --> 1:30:15,42
a living entity in a human body can experience.


1235
1:30:15,42 --> 1:30:21,499
Bliss is our birthright. We were made to enjoy love and happiness.


1236
1:30:21,499 --> 1:30:27,112
That bliss is always there, there's so much potential for bliss. Right?


1237
1:30:27,112 --> 1:30:29,444
It's like a light switch - you go to turn it on,


1238
1:30:29,444 --> 1:30:31,642
and you know that the moment you turn it on,


1239
1:30:31,642 --> 1:30:33,736
the light comes on and the room fills.


1240
1:30:33,736 --> 1:30:39,527
That's what the bliss is like, it's just there waiting for you to just turn it on,


1241
1:30:39,527 --> 1:30:42,93
and you can tap into it - as much as you want.


1242
1:30:42,93 --> 1:30:46,681
So people are not reminded of that. They are being pulled away by distractions:


1243
1:30:46,681 --> 1:30:52,92
"Go to work." "Go to school." "Do this, do that." "Get a career."


1244
1:30:52,92 --> 1:30:57,381
And - guess what? The bliss just gets left behind, all the time.


1245
1:30:57,381 --> 1:30:59,215
They just leave it behind.


1246
1:30:59,215 --> 1:31:1,628
Why not enjoy it? It's there.


1247
1:31:1,628 --> 1:31:6,557
God is total Love, and there is nothing else.


1248
1:31:6,557 --> 1:31:9,656
And Love is the glue of the Universe.


1249
1:31:9,656 --> 1:31:16,249
Now is the time to embrace the Love, and to leave the fear behind.


1250
1:31:16,249 --> 1:31:22,899
It's quite as simple as that. Because fear means you have a fear of losing something.


1251
1:31:22,899 --> 1:31:26,869
What could that be? All those possessions out there?


1252
1:31:26,869 --> 1:31:30,244
All those material illusions or your body?


1253
1:31:30,244 --> 1:31:35,609
Well, the body is going to die anyway. It's only a matter of time.


1254
1:31:35,609 --> 1:31:40,19
But the one that embraces the love,


1255
1:31:40,19 --> 1:31:45,847
is the one that knows that he can never lose.


1256
1:31:45,847 --> 1:31:50,364
And when you find that love and you know that you can never lose,


1257
1:31:50,364 --> 1:31:56,13
come what may - it may be physical destruction,


1258
1:31:56,13 --> 1:32:2,339
and it may be just general chaos and fear,


1259
1:32:2,339 --> 1:32:9,32
and anguish attacking us from all corners, but if you remain in love,


1260
1:32:9,32 --> 1:32:12,859
you receive all the blessings, so there should be nothing at all to fear


1261
1:32:12,859 --> 1:32:15,871
about 2012 and what is coming.


1262
1:32:15,871 --> 1:32:19,171
The eyes of fear wants you to put bigger locks on your door,


1263
1:32:19,171 --> 1:32:24,99
buy guns, close yourself off the eyes of love, instead see all of us as one.


1264
1:32:24,99 --> 1:32:28,668
Here's what we can do to change the world right now to a better ride.


1265
1:32:28,668 --> 1:32:31,248
Take all that money we spend on weapons and defense each year,


1266
1:32:31,248 --> 1:32:34,783
instead spend it feeding, clothing, educating the poor of the world,


1267
1:32:34,783 --> 1:32:37,634
which it would many times over, not one human being excluded,


1268
1:32:37,634 --> 1:32:41,386
and we can explore space together,


1269
1:32:41,386 --> 1:32:44,253
both inner and outer.


1270
1:32:44,253 --> 1:32:45,553
Forever.


1271
1:32:45,553 --> 1:32:49,75
We are not governed by any calendar, no event or any such thing.


1272
1:32:49,75 --> 1:32:55,73
Every decision you make, takes you in a different direction.


1273
1:32:55,73 --> 1:33:0,7
When you make good decisions, all the time, take a moment to breathe,


1274
1:33:0,7 --> 1:33:4,678
come into the now, make a conscious decision.


1275
1:33:4,678 --> 1:33:6,28
Everything has changed.


1276
1:33:6,28 --> 1:33:11,778
The most important things I'd like to say to people is - to know who you are,


1277
1:33:11,778 --> 1:33:17,471
reclaim your sovereignty, and learn the science of "As above, so below" -


1278
1:33:17,471 --> 1:33:19,414
the macrocosm and the microcosm,


1279
1:33:19,414 --> 1:33:26,494
because we are the microcosm of the Universe, of the whole Universe.


1280
1:33:26,494 --> 1:33:32,889
Our body is Universe, full of atoms, trillions of atoms, which are stars.


1281
1:33:32,889 --> 1:33:37,177
I think we're a part of a greater wisdom that we'll ever understand,


1282
1:33:37,177 --> 1:33:39,756
a higher order, call it what you want.


1283
1:33:39,756 --> 1:33:43,512
You know what I call it? The Big Electron!


1284
1:33:43,512 --> 1:33:44,876
The Big Electron!


1285
1:33:44,876 --> 1:33:51,197
"Woooww... Woooww... Woooww"


1286
1:33:51,197 --> 1:33:55,294
It doesn't punish, it doesn't reward, it doesn't judge at all.


1287
1:33:55,294 --> 1:33:59,426
It just is, and so are we. For a little while.


1288
1:33:59,426 --> 1:34:5,27
So, once we know this and we realize what we really are, and who we really are,


1289
1:34:5,27 --> 1:34:14,474
then we stand up and ignore, virtually ignore this system of fear


1290
1:34:14,474 --> 1:34:22,969
and embrace the love, and nothing, there's nothing that can stop us,


1291
1:34:22,969 --> 1:34:25,644
there's nothing that can hurt us,


1292
1:34:25,644 --> 1:34:29,27
there's nothing that can cause us to fear anymore.


1293
1:34:29,27 --> 1:34:35,313
Whatever we do in our life, please make sure that we sprinkle some spirituality onto it.


1294
1:34:35,313 --> 1:34:38,103
When we sprinkle something spiritual onto it,


1295
1:34:38,103 --> 1:34:42,21
we also get the benefit of inner peace, inner calmness,


1296
1:34:42,21 --> 1:34:46,973
otherwise we get so lost in this world, that we do not know what we want,


1297
1:34:46,973 --> 1:34:48,851
and that's a very bad state to be in.


1298
1:34:48,851 --> 1:34:51,89
So do take up some spiritual practice every day,


1299
1:34:51,89 --> 1:34:58,89
so that it helps you to nurture your mind, nurture your intellect, calms your mind.


1300
1:34:58,89 --> 1:35:0,74
Be a sane person in this insane world!


1301
1:35:0,74 --> 1:35:4,444
Be the happy person, so that you can help other people be happy.


1302
1:35:4,444 --> 1:35:7,322
Otherwise you're a part of the problem yourself,


1303
1:35:7,322 --> 1:35:9,4
and that's a worst place to be in.


1304
1:35:9,4 --> 1:35:12,643
We left a great place of unconditioned consciousness,


1305
1:35:12,643 --> 1:35:17,669
and the purpose of life is to go through this cycle of necessity,


1306
1:35:17,669 --> 1:35:21,352
glean all the wisdom that we can from it and return to the cause


1307
1:35:21,352 --> 1:35:24,987
much more than we were before. Much, much more.


1308
1:35:24,987 --> 1:35:29,725
For those people who have been a victim of the propaganda,


1309
1:35:29,725 --> 1:35:34,623
the 2012 agenda to promote fear,


1310
1:35:34,623 --> 1:35:40,855
what I would say the best thing to do is - not to get fooled by that,


1311
1:35:40,855 --> 1:35:43,29
and your worst enemy is the fear itself.


1312
1:35:43,29 --> 1:35:46,322
And to just trust in love.


1313
1:35:46,322 --> 1:35:51,832
You are what you think. What you think, you will become.


1314
1:35:51,832 --> 1:35:56,372
When the Buddha says that we are what we think,


1315
1:35:56,372 --> 1:36:1,668
then I think we would be advised to hold the most positive and grand view


1316
1:36:1,668 --> 1:36:5,613
we can possibly have, cause what you think about is what you're going to create.


1317
1:36:5,613 --> 1:36:10,713
So every day make it a blissful spiritual day, and share that,


1318
1:36:10,713 --> 1:36:16,522
share compassion, share love. Drop the fear.


1319
1:36:16,522 --> 1:36:20,29
There's nothing to fear, except fear itself.


1320
1:36:20,29 --> 1:36:25,172
It's really true, what my guru and other teachers have said,


1321
1:36:25,172 --> 1:36:28,609
that if you want to change the world, you've got to start with yourself.


1322
1:36:28,609 --> 1:36:33,198
Changing the world is not something in the future anymore,


1323
1:36:33,198 --> 1:36:35,45
"Oh it will be better for the kids."


1324
1:36:35,45 --> 1:36:37,668
It's here now, and we are going  to see it happen.


1325
1:36:37,668 --> 1:36:44,54
The more one loves and finds unity in this world, and harmony,


1326
1:36:44,54 --> 1:36:48,35
the more the blessings will be when that time comes.


1327
1:36:48,35 --> 1:36:50,93
And the time is coming, it's a coming,


1328
1:36:50,93 --> 1:36:55,244
the beautiful rewards for all those who are poised to receive them.


1329
1:36:55,244 --> 1:36:56,694
They are coming.


1330
1:36:56,694 --> 1:37:2,977
The new world of love is coming.


1331
1:37:2,977 --> 1:37:7,871
As the date approaches, more and more people are becoming aware of its significance.


1332
1:37:7,871 --> 1:37:11,43
Is it really a window of great changes in consciousness?


1333
1:37:11,43 --> 1:37:14,591
Is that what the ancients were trying to tell us?


1334
1:37:14,591 --> 1:37:19,255
When we take a look around the world, we have seen decades of dictatorships collapse,


1335
1:37:19,255 --> 1:37:26,933
as humanity united and march the streets in Tunisia, Yemen and Egypt.


1336
1:37:26,933 --> 1:37:29,741
Injustices have been exposed by WikiLeaks,


1337
1:37:29,741 --> 1:37:33,254
such as the "Afghan War Logs" which uncovered corruption,


1338
1:37:33,254 --> 1:37:42,595
murder of civilians, and a multitude of US military cover-ups.


1339
1:37:42,595 --> 1:37:46,715
A global network of truth and awareness is uniting mankind


1340
1:37:46,715 --> 1:37:51,736
via technology and the Internet - the one last channel left un-filtered.


1341
1:37:51,736 --> 1:37:54,904
As knowledge is spreading, people are awakening,


1342
1:37:54,904 --> 1:37:58,998
and we are beginning to see a clearer picture of the world that we live in.


1343
1:37:58,998 --> 1:38:3,125
Consciousness is shifting right before our eyes.


1344
1:38:3,125 --> 1:38:9,272
The people in power may try to negatively influence the outcome of the coming shift.


1345
1:38:9,272 --> 1:38:13,695
By creating a world war or collapsing the global financial system.


1346
1:38:13,695 --> 1:38:18,784
They may generate enough fear to open the gates to their New World Order.


1347
1:38:18,784 --> 1:38:22,453
If that day comes - we need to remember their true agenda,


1348
1:38:22,453 --> 1:38:26,713
unite as one and rise in love and compassion.


1349
1:38:26,713 --> 1:38:35,577
Crowd: "Troops out now! Troops out now! Troops out now....!"


1350
1:38:35,577 --> 1:38:53,32
Crowd : "The people united will never be defeated!", "The people united will never be defeated!"...


1351
1:38:53,32 --> 1:38:55,41
What is the pathway forward?


1352
1:38:55,41 --> 1:38:58,609
Perhaps we are here right now to define what comes next?


1353
1:38:58,609 --> 1:39:2,55
Is it not up to us to act together and build a better future?


1354
1:39:2,55 --> 1:39:8,94
A world without suffering?


1355
1:39:8,94 --> 1:39:14,49
We have learned that the galactic shift is empowering us to create great change,


1356
1:39:14,49 --> 1:39:19,677
and the elites are trying to influence that change with fear.


1357
1:39:19,677 --> 1:39:25,475
We have learned that we are fractals of one consciousness experiencing itself


1358
1:39:25,475 --> 1:39:29,406
and with the power of the collective we can change our experience


1359
1:39:29,406 --> 1:39:33,919
anytime we choose to do so.


1360
1:39:33,919 --> 1:39:38,1
When we focus all our devotion and envision a new beginning,


1361
1:39:38,1 --> 1:39:41,178
we will create a world of peace,


1362
1:39:41,178 --> 1:39:42,827
love,


1363
1:39:42,827 --> 1:39:45,982
and harmony.


1364
1:39:45,982 --> 1:39:51,686
The time is Right Now. Heaven or Hell on earth is up to us.


1365
1:39:51,686 --> 1:39:55,807
And it's only a choice between fear and love.


1366
1:39:55,807 --> 1:39:59,92
How this will play out - only time will tell,


1367
1:39:59,92 --> 1:40:3,421
as we approach December 21st 2012,


1368
1:40:3,421 --> 1:40:11,28
and beyond.


1369
1:40:11,28 --> 1:40:13,168
In the seventeenth chapter of St. Luke, it’s written


1370
1:40:13,168 --> 1:40:17,855
the kingdom of God is within man”, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men!


1371
1:40:17,855 --> 1:40:22,81
In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines,


1372
1:40:22,81 --> 1:40:23,764
the power to create happiness!


1373
1:40:23,764 --> 1:40:27,316
You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful,


1374
1:40:27,316 --> 1:40:29,85
to make this life a wonderful adventure.


1375
1:40:29,85 --> 1:40:33,11
Now let us fight to fulfill that promise!


1376
1:40:33,11 --> 1:40:37,394
Let us fight to free the world! To do away with national barriers!


1377
1:40:37,394 --> 1:40:41,151
To do away with greed, with hate and intolerance!


1378
1:40:41,151 --> 1:40:43,373
Let us fight for a world of reason,


1379
1:40:43,373 --> 1:40:47,763
a world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness.


1380
1:40:47,763 --> 1:42:36,66
LET US ALL UNITE!!!


1381
1:42:36,66 --> 1:42:41,439
It's an endless ocean of bliss.


1382
1:42:41,439 --> 1:42:46,915
Part of one vast ocean of intelligent living energy.


1383
1:42:46,915 --> 1:42:58,712
It's an energy, it's a force, it's the force of God.


1384
1:42:58,712 --> 1:43:4,511
The idea is to be in touch with this energy, to understand it.


1385
1:43:4,511 --> 1:43:11,713
It's urging us toward higher growth and toward higher evolution.


1386
1:43:11,713 --> 1:43:15,866
Like an electric shock, the Kundalini went right up my spine.


1387
1:43:15,866 --> 1:43:19,188
I felt connected to every single living thing, and in fact,


1388
1:43:19,188 --> 1:43:23,337
I felt connected to everything in the entire universe and cosmos,


1389
1:43:23,337 --> 1:43:24,32
I felt one with it.


1390
1:43:24,32 --> 1:43:28,819
Tremendous amounts of love and peace, complete acceptance,


1391
1:43:28,819 --> 1:43:31,491
complete love, complete everything.


1392
1:43:31,491 --> 1:43:36,94
Absolute truth, absolute consciousness, and absolute bliss.


1393
1:43:36,94 --> 1:43:39,498
That's our nature. Our nature is bliss.


1394
1:43:39,498 --> 1:43:44,273
When you experience that, you will never be the same ever again.


1395
1:43:44,273 --> 1:43:47,155
Don't ever let anybody tell you what God is.


1396
1:43:47,155 --> 1:43:52,227
Find out for yourself.


1397
1:43:52,227 --> 1:43:54,64
V/O: There is a secret buried inside of everyone.
