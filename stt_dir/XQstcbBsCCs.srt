1
0:0:3,386 --> 0:0:4,354
- Calm down.


2
0:0:4,354 --> 0:0:5,422
You'll figure it out.


3
0:0:5,422 --> 0:0:6,656
- Well, what if I don't?


4
0:0:6,656 --> 0:0:8,325
This is a big opportunity for me.


5
0:0:8,325 --> 0:0:10,293
I am producing a photo shoot.


6
0:0:10,293 --> 0:0:12,495
- So you're telling me that none
of these kids will work.


7
0:0:12,495 --> 0:0:14,431
- No, he wants a fresh face
to move his product,


8
0:0:14,431 --> 0:0:16,566
And these kids are too recognizable.


9
0:0:16,566 --> 0:0:17,701
I just...


10
0:0:17,701 --> 0:0:19,736
Oh-ho-ho.


11
0:0:19,736 --> 0:0:22,5
I love this kid.


12
0:0:22,5 --> 0:0:24,7
This is the one
in that chocolate commercial.


13
0:0:24,7 --> 0:0:25,575
- The one who slaps the lady.


14
0:0:25,575 --> 0:0:27,43
- And grabs the chocolate and says...


15
0:0:27,43 --> 0:0:30,413
You eat that, you eat this next.


16
0:0:30,413 --> 0:0:31,314
- He's so cute.


17
0:0:31,314 --> 0:0:32,749
- Hey, mom. Hey, Gigi.


18
0:0:32,749 --> 0:0:37,921
- Hi, sweetie.


19
0:0:37,921 --> 0:0:39,856
- Smile.


20
0:0:39,856 --> 0:0:41,558
Tilt your head.


21
0:0:41,558 --> 0:0:43,693
The other way.


22
0:0:43,693 --> 0:0:46,596
- Okay, you're not thinking
what I think you're thinking.


23
0:0:46,596 --> 0:0:47,864
- That's what I'm thinking.


24
0:0:47,864 --> 0:0:49,499
- Okay, it's not gonna work.


25
0:0:49,499 --> 0:0:51,835
Kevin, go upstairs and take a shower.


26
0:0:51,835 --> 0:0:55,472
You smell like hot dog water.


27
0:0:55,472 --> 0:0:57,7
- Give me one good reason why not.


28
0:0:57,7 --> 0:0:59,909
- Because Kevin
is not child model material.


29
0:0:59,909 --> 0:1:2,512
He's not gonna change
into all those outfits.


30
0:1:2,512 --> 0:1:4,848
He hates changing
his own clothes as it is.


31
0:1:4,848 --> 0:1:6,516
- I can be very persuasive.


32
0:1:6,516 --> 0:1:9,52
- Maybe to a grown man
but not to a 12-year-old.


33
0:1:9,52 --> 0:1:10,654
You ain't got nothing he wants,


34
0:1:10,654 --> 0:1:12,489
Unless there's a ps3 in your purse.


35
0:1:12,489 --> 0:1:14,157
- Hmm.
- Hey, Gigi.


36
0:1:14,157 --> 0:1:15,358
- Hey.


37
0:1:15,358 --> 0:1:16,359
- Baby.
- Hmm?


38
0:1:16,359 --> 0:1:17,594
- I got to talk to you
about something.


39
0:1:17,594 --> 0:1:18,628
- Okay, what's that?


40
0:1:18,628 --> 0:1:20,163
- So remember how I was telling you


41
0:1:20,163 --> 0:1:21,831
About this guy at work, Devon?


42
0:1:21,831 --> 0:1:22,932
- Oh, the sales guy.


43
0:1:22,932 --> 0:1:24,534
- Well, we got to talking,


44
0:1:24,534 --> 0:1:27,537
And it turns out he sells all
the ads that run on the station,


45
0:1:27,537 --> 0:1:29,5
And he wanted to talk to me,


46
0:1:29,5 --> 0:1:31,274
Because he thought I should know
that all the sponsors


47
0:1:31,274 --> 0:1:32,709
Really like what I'm doing on-air.


48
0:1:32,709 --> 0:1:34,577
- Oh, that's good.
- Yeah, that's good, right?


49
0:1:34,577 --> 0:1:35,845
And then he was like,


50
0:1:35,845 --> 0:1:37,747
"yo, we probably should
get together sometime."


51
0:1:37,747 --> 0:1:39,749
And then I was thinking,
he talks to all the people


52
0:1:39,749 --> 0:1:41,484
That need to know that people like me.


53
0:1:41,484 --> 0:1:43,86
And then I was like, "cool."


54
0:1:43,86 --> 0:1:44,654
- Nick, is this story going somewhere?


55
0:1:44,654 --> 0:1:48,24
- Look, I invited Devon
and his wife over for dinner.


56
0:1:48,24 --> 0:1:49,325
- Oh, okay, great,


57
0:1:49,325 --> 0:1:51,628
But we probably should have
gone out for drinks first,


58
0:1:51,628 --> 0:1:54,264
Get to know them before
we have them in our house.


59
0:1:54,264 --> 0:1:55,432
- Ohh, you're right.


60
0:1:55,432 --> 0:1:56,599
I'm sorry.


61
0:1:56,599 --> 0:1:58,201
- That's okay. So when is the dinner?


62
0:1:58,201 --> 0:1:59,736
- Tonight.
- What?


63
0:1:59,736 --> 0:2:9,579
- At 7:00.
- Nick.

65
0:2:12,816 --> 0:2:13,783
- Whoo!


66
0:2:13,783 --> 0:2:15,785
Ahh! Good.


67
0:2:15,785 --> 0:2:17,32
So like I said, Kevin,


68
0:2:17,32 --> 0:2:20,857
All you have to do is
change your clothes and smile.


69
0:2:20,857 --> 0:2:23,927
- Yeah, while some weird dude
takes pictures of me.


70
0:2:23,927 --> 0:2:26,362
- Okay, Kevin, honey, you got to think


71
0:2:26,362 --> 0:2:29,265
About what this could do
for you, right?


72
0:2:29,265 --> 0:2:31,34
I mean, your face will be


73
0:2:31,34 --> 0:2:34,871
In every single frame
this company sells.


74
0:2:34,871 --> 0:2:37,107
I mean, boo, you will be famous.


75
0:2:37,107 --> 0:2:39,209
- Yeah, until I'm grown and broke,


76
0:2:39,209 --> 0:2:40,91
Because my accountant
stole all my money,


77
0:2:40,91 --> 0:2:43,413
And then I'll have to work
as a security guard at the mall


78
0:2:43,413 --> 0:2:45,815
And marry some woman
who doesn't really love me


79
0:2:45,815 --> 0:2:47,383
And pushes me down a flight of stairs


80
0:2:47,383 --> 0:2:49,886
And then waits 30 minutes
to call the paramedics.


81
0:2:49,886 --> 0:2:50,987
Ring a bell?


82
0:2:50,987 --> 0:2:53,356
- We don't know if that's true.


83
0:2:53,356 --> 0:2:55,925
Okay, how much?


84
0:2:55,925 --> 0:2:56,96
- 200.


85
0:2:56,96 --> 0:2:58,528
- 150.


86
0:2:58,528 --> 0:2:59,963
- 200.


87
0:2:59,963 --> 0:3:1,498
- 175.


88
0:3:1,498 --> 0:3:2,632
- 205.


89
0:3:2,632 --> 0:3:4,801
- Okay, you obviously don't know
how this works.


90
0:3:4,801 --> 0:3:6,469
- Or do I?


91
0:3:6,469 --> 0:3:12,275
- Fine. Deal.


92
0:3:12,275 --> 0:3:13,643
- Suzanne.
- Hmm?


93
0:3:13,643 --> 0:3:16,312
- This chicken is off the hook.


94
0:3:16,312 --> 0:3:17,68
No, seriously.


95
0:3:17,68 --> 0:3:20,35
Here's the chicken,
and here's the hook.


96
0:3:20,35 --> 0:3:22,619
It's off, you know?


97
0:3:22,619 --> 0:3:23,853
This chicken is so good


98
0:3:23,853 --> 0:3:25,455
That if I were lost
on a deserted island


99
0:3:25,455 --> 0:3:27,724
And a rescue boat
with destiny's child,


100
0:3:27,724 --> 0:3:29,259
The Kardashian's, Charlie's angels,


101
0:3:29,259 --> 0:3:31,27
And the pussycat dolls pulled up


102
0:3:31,27 --> 0:3:34,464
And they said they had a spot
for me but not this chicken,


103
0:3:34,464 --> 0:3:36,499
I would let that boat keep on going,


104
0:3:36,499 --> 0:3:41,805
And I would stay on that island
with this chicken.


105
0:3:41,805 --> 0:3:43,673
- Now, if you want
an amazing roasted chicken,


106
0:3:43,673 --> 0:3:45,809
You have to try Harrison's.


107
0:3:45,809 --> 0:3:47,343
You might find it a little too pricey,


108
0:3:47,343 --> 0:3:48,812
But it is to die for.


109
0:3:48,812 --> 0:3:51,147
- I guess we'll have to try
Harrison's, honey.


110
0:3:51,147 --> 0:3:52,315
- I guess so.


111
0:3:52,315 --> 0:3:53,75
It's to die for.


112
0:3:53,75 --> 0:3:55,151
- So, Suzanne, you must be impressed.


113
0:3:55,151 --> 0:3:57,253
Devon's been talking
to some very important people


114
0:3:57,253 --> 0:3:58,488
About your husband.


115
0:3:58,488 --> 0:4:0,99
- And no matter what I say,
they refuse to fire him.


116
0:4:0,99 --> 0:4:2,959
Just kidding.


117
0:4:2,959 --> 0:4:6,62
Your husband is gonna be the man
over there one day.


118
0:4:6,62 --> 0:4:7,63
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.


119
0:4:7,63 --> 0:4:9,232
You know, one day, I will be the man,


120
0:4:9,232 --> 0:4:11,434
But right now, you are the man.


121
0:4:11,434 --> 0:4:14,671
- That's a compliment
coming from you, the man.


122
0:4:14,671 --> 0:4:16,206
- Okay, I accept.


123
0:4:16,206 --> 0:4:18,141
I am the man.


124
0:4:18,141 --> 0:4:19,142
- No, you're not.


125
0:4:19,142 --> 0:4:21,144
I'm the man.


126
0:4:21,144 --> 0:4:25,982
Just kidding.


127
0:4:25,982 --> 0:4:28,685
- Katie, remember, if Rico asks you,


128
0:4:28,685 --> 0:4:31,87
I don't like him,
unless you find out from bo


129
0:4:31,87 --> 0:4:32,722
That Corey doesn't like me first.


130
0:4:32,722 --> 0:4:35,692
Then if Rico says he likes me,


131
0:4:35,692 --> 0:4:38,561
Yeah, you can then say that
I might or might not like him.


132
0:4:38,561 --> 0:4:39,963
Okay, see you at school tomorrow.


133
0:4:39,963 --> 0:4:41,64
Bye.


134
0:4:41,64 --> 0:4:42,532
- Lindsey, come here.


135
0:4:42,532 --> 0:4:43,867
I want you to meet some friends.


136
0:4:43,867 --> 0:4:45,468
This is Devon and mara Sawyer.


137
0:4:45,468 --> 0:4:46,903
- Hi, I'm Lindsey. Nice to meet you.


138
0:4:46,903 --> 0:4:48,371
- Hey, Lindsey.
- Hello.


139
0:4:48,371 --> 0:4:50,306
- Cool. Mom, I'm just gonna do
some homework upstairs.


140
0:4:50,306 --> 0:4:51,975
- Okay.
- It's nice meeting you guys.


141
0:4:51,975 --> 0:4:53,61
- All right, bye, baby.
- Bye.


142
0:4:53,61 --> 0:4:56,613
- Nick, Suzanne,
what a lovely young lady,


143
0:4:56,613 --> 0:4:57,947
So well-mannered,


144
0:4:57,947 --> 0:5:0,35
Seems like she has
a good head on her shoulders.


145
0:5:0,35 --> 0:5:2,85
- Thank you. That means a lot.


146
0:5:2,85 --> 0:5:3,753
- You know,
Lindsey's a very popular name


147
0:5:3,753 --> 0:5:4,988
For boys in Scotland.


148
0:5:4,988 --> 0:5:8,391
- It's also quite popular
for girls in rehab.


149
0:5:8,391 --> 0:5:10,593
- Really?


150
0:5:10,593 --> 0:5:13,263
So when's the last time
you were there?


151
0:5:13,263 --> 0:5:14,964
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.


152
0:5:14,964 --> 0:5:17,667
I will not have you insult my wife


153
0:5:17,667 --> 0:5:20,97
And ask her when she
was last in rehab.


154
0:5:20,97 --> 0:5:24,307
It was Tuesday.


155
0:5:24,307 --> 0:5:27,844
- Oh, man, you are nuts. You are nuts.


156
0:5:27,844 --> 0:5:29,178
- So where are the kids in school?


157
0:5:29,178 --> 0:5:32,282
- Lindsey goes to
Meredith Frasier high,


158
0:5:32,282 --> 0:5:35,18
And our son Kevin
is at curt flannel middle.


159
0:5:35,18 --> 0:5:36,386
- Oh, no, no, no, no.


160
0:5:36,386 --> 0:5:38,254
Devon, you just have to get them
into weakly.


161
0:5:38,254 --> 0:5:39,355
- Weakly?


162
0:5:39,355 --> 0:5:41,57
- Weakly prep, 7 through 12.


163
0:5:41,57 --> 0:5:43,526
- You know, the station owner,
Mr. Waters,


164
0:5:43,526 --> 0:5:44,627
His kids go there,


165
0:5:44,627 --> 0:5:46,729
And so do both
of the evening anchors'.


166
0:5:46,729 --> 0:5:48,431
- Isn't it hard to get in?


167
0:5:48,431 --> 0:5:50,99
- Not for a family like you.


168
0:5:50,99 --> 0:5:51,668
I'll put a good word in
with the board.


169
0:5:51,668 --> 0:5:54,804
- Suzanne, all I can tell you is...


170
0:5:54,804 --> 0:5:58,174
- Ah, I know, it's to die for.


171
0:5:58,174 --> 0:5:59,442
- Like these Greens.


172
0:5:59,442 --> 0:6:0,91
If I was trapped on a desert island


173
0:6:0,91 --> 0:6:2,245
With these Greens


174
0:6:2,245 --> 0:6:4,881
And a rescue boat
with the girls gone wild,


175
0:6:4,881 --> 0:6:7,283
The laker girls, and the girl
with the dragon tattoo came up


176
0:6:7,283 --> 0:6:8,985
And they said, "we have room for you


177
0:6:8,985 --> 0:6:10,753
But not the Greens," I...


178
0:6:10,753 --> 0:6:12,55
- I already know.


179
0:6:12,55 --> 0:6:15,425
I know you would stay
on the island with the Greens.


180
0:6:15,425 --> 0:6:17,593
- What the hell are you talking about?


181
0:6:17,593 --> 0:6:18,895
No, I'd get on the boat.


182
0:6:18,895 --> 0:6:21,497
What are the odds
of a third boat coming by?


183
0:6:21,497 --> 0:6:30,365
These Greens are good,
but I'm not stupid.


184
0:6:30,365 --> 0:6:33,301
- So you didn't hear any of that?


185
0:6:33,301 --> 0:6:34,736
- Hear any of what?


186
0:6:34,736 --> 0:6:36,137
- The woman spent the whole night


187
0:6:36,137 --> 0:6:37,572
Trying to one-up me.


188
0:6:37,572 --> 0:6:40,208
<i>you just have to get
your hair done at royale's</i>.


189
0:6:40,208 --> 0:6:42,811
<i>you just have to get
your coffee from Louise's.</i>


190
0:6:42,811 --> 0:6:46,14
<i>when you die, you just have to
be buried at Justin's cemetery.</i>


191
0:6:46,14 --> 0:6:47,415
<i>It's to die for.</i>


192
0:6:47,415 --> 0:6:49,5
- I get it. You don't like her.


193
0:6:49,5 --> 0:6:51,386
But I am still looking
into this school.


194
0:6:51,386 --> 0:6:53,922
This could be a real good
opportunity for the kids.


195
0:6:53,922 --> 0:6:56,725
- Nick, the kids
aren't switching schools.


196
0:6:56,725 --> 0:6:58,426
They're doing fine where they are.


197
0:6:58,426 --> 0:7:0,695
- Are you saying that because
you don't like the school


198
0:7:0,695 --> 0:7:2,597
Or because you don't like the people?


199
0:7:2,597 --> 0:7:4,265
- What's the difference?


200
0:7:4,265 --> 0:7:6,835
Those are the people at the school.


201
0:7:6,835 --> 0:7:8,436
- I'm sure there was
somebody you hated


202
0:7:8,436 --> 0:7:10,839
At the Beyonce concert,
but we still went to that.


203
0:7:10,839 --> 0:7:14,42
- Nick, the woman didn't say
anything about the school.


204
0:7:14,42 --> 0:7:16,311
All she talked about
was who went there.


205
0:7:16,311 --> 0:7:18,46
- Okay, fine.


206
0:7:18,46 --> 0:7:21,149
You don't want do it;
I won't push you.


207
0:7:21,149 --> 0:7:25,92
It's just your children's education.


208
0:7:25,92 --> 0:7:29,457
- Fine. We will look into it.


209
0:7:29,457 --> 0:7:30,792
But I don't like you right now.


210
0:7:30,792 --> 0:7:38,32
- And yet you're still here.


211
0:7:38,32 --> 0:7:40,335
- How many more of these things
do I have to wear?


212
0:7:40,335 --> 0:7:42,103
- These things are called outfits,


213
0:7:42,103 --> 0:7:43,505
And you have 11 more to go.


214
0:7:43,505 --> 0:7:45,106
- Hey.
- Hi.


215
0:7:45,106 --> 0:7:47,809
- How's it going
on the child model front?


216
0:7:47,809 --> 0:7:49,744
- How's it look like it's going?
I mean, look at me.


217
0:7:49,744 --> 0:7:51,646
I look like Chris Brown,
the early years.


218
0:7:51,646 --> 0:7:54,482
- Let's go.


219
0:7:54,482 --> 0:7:55,617
- All right.


220
0:7:55,617 --> 0:7:57,952
Baby, this school
looks pretty good, right?


221
0:7:57,952 --> 0:7:59,854
- Okay, I will admit it.


222
0:7:59,854 --> 0:8:3,925
I was very skeptical at first,
but it is a really nice school,


223
0:8:3,925 --> 0:8:7,162
And they get 100%
of their graduates into college.


224
0:8:7,162 --> 0:8:8,396
- Mm-hmm.


225
0:8:8,396 --> 0:8:9,864
- In my school, they couldn't get 100%


226
0:8:9,864 --> 0:8:10,932
Of the class to graduate.


227
0:8:10,932 --> 0:8:12,801
Some of those fools are still there.


228
0:8:12,801 --> 0:8:14,402
- Well, it looks like our chances


229
0:8:14,402 --> 0:8:16,771
Of getting into this school
are actually pretty good.


230
0:8:16,771 --> 0:8:18,306
- What makes you say that?


231
0:8:18,306 --> 0:8:20,442
- Baby, Devon's on the board.


232
0:8:20,442 --> 0:8:23,344
- Why wouldn't he mention that
in the first place?


233
0:8:23,344 --> 0:8:26,47
- Maybe he was waiting for us
to make the first move.


234
0:8:26,47 --> 0:8:27,148
- Hmm.


235
0:8:27,148 --> 0:8:29,117
- Look, all we need to do
is fill this out,


236
0:8:29,117 --> 0:8:31,586
Get the kids' transcripts,
recommendations,


237
0:8:31,586 --> 0:8:34,189
Physicals, pictures,
and get it into Devon.


238
0:8:34,189 --> 0:8:35,39
Anything else I'm forgetting?


239
0:8:35,39 --> 0:8:38,593
- How about telling the kids?


240
0:8:38,593 --> 0:8:42,897
- Nah.


241
0:8:42,897 --> 0:8:44,599
- What's wrong with the school I'm in?


242
0:8:44,599 --> 0:8:45,867
- Nothing.


243
0:8:45,867 --> 0:8:47,802
It's just that we have to think
about your future.


244
0:8:47,802 --> 0:8:49,7
- I think about my future.


245
0:8:49,7 --> 0:8:51,105
I was gonna finish
High School, college,


246
0:8:51,105 --> 0:8:52,707
Get married, have some kids,


247
0:8:52,707 --> 0:8:55,9
But now I'm gonna end up
a part-time stripper,


248
0:8:55,9 --> 0:8:56,945
Pregnant, on drugs,
with a tattoo on my back


249
0:8:56,945 --> 0:8:58,12
And a piercing in my lip


250
0:8:58,12 --> 0:8:59,814
All because I rebelled against you


251
0:8:59,814 --> 0:9:2,684
When you made me change schools.


252
0:9:2,684 --> 0:9:4,285
- Give it a chance.


253
0:9:4,285 --> 0:9:5,753
You haven't even been there.


254
0:9:5,753 --> 0:9:7,322
- I think it's awesome.


255
0:9:7,322 --> 0:9:8,923
Every class has smart boards.


256
0:9:8,923 --> 0:9:10,658
Every kid gets their own laptop.


257
0:9:10,658 --> 0:9:12,794
Plus they have to wear a uniform.


258
0:9:12,794 --> 0:9:13,895
You know what that means?


259
0:9:13,895 --> 0:9:15,63
That means I can literally wear


260
0:9:15,63 --> 0:9:16,764
The same thing to school every day.


261
0:9:16,764 --> 0:9:18,266
- You still have to wash it.


262
0:9:18,266 --> 0:9:20,201
- Yeah, maybe eventually.


263
0:9:20,201 --> 0:9:21,836
- All the girls there are snobby,


264
0:9:21,836 --> 0:9:23,705
And all the guys there are corny.


265
0:9:23,705 --> 0:9:25,54
- You're not going there for the boys.


266
0:9:25,54 --> 0:9:27,8
You're going there for the grades.


267
0:9:27,8 --> 0:9:30,445
- Do you have any idea how girls work?


268
0:9:30,445 --> 0:9:33,515
Honey, everything
you're saying is true,


269
0:9:33,515 --> 0:9:36,117
But next year,
you're gonna be a junior,


270
0:9:36,117 --> 0:9:37,952
And that's the one
that counts the most


271
0:9:37,952 --> 0:9:39,487
when it comes to college admission's


272
0:9:39,487 --> 0:9:41,456
- Oh, my God.


273
0:9:41,456 --> 0:9:43,191
Their P.E. Class is skiing.


274
0:9:43,191 --> 0:9:46,194
They even have a class where
you don't have to go to class.


275
0:9:46,194 --> 0:9:50,732
- Whatever.
It's not like I have a choice.


276
0:9:50,732 --> 0:9:52,233
- They have fencing?


277
0:9:52,233 --> 0:9:53,835
This school is awesome.


278
0:9:53,835 --> 0:10:0,475
Do you think I can get my own sword?


279
0:10:0,475 --> 0:10:2,11
- Mr. And Mrs. Kingston-persons,


280
0:10:2,11 --> 0:10:4,212
Thank you so much for joining myself


281
0:10:4,212 --> 0:10:6,648
And the rest of the board
this afternoon.


282
0:10:6,648 --> 0:10:7,815
As the head of the board,


283
0:10:7,815 --> 0:10:9,751
I'll be conducting the interview.


284
0:10:9,751 --> 0:10:12,53
If anyone has anything to add,
please chime in.


285
0:10:12,53 --> 0:10:14,88
- I'd like to chime in.


286
0:10:14,88 --> 0:10:17,58
I would just like to say
that this school is so nice


287
0:10:17,58 --> 0:10:19,761
That if my kids were stranded
alone on a desert island


288
0:10:19,761 --> 0:10:22,931
And all they had was an x-box,
another x-box,


289
0:10:22,931 --> 0:10:25,567
A flat-screen tv,
a box of cell phones,


290
0:10:25,567 --> 0:10:26,935
Drake, and no curfew


291
0:10:26,935 --> 0:10:29,537
And this school showed up
on a ship to pick them up,


292
0:10:29,537 --> 0:10:32,874
They would go with this school.


293
0:10:32,874 --> 0:10:34,475
They would...


294
0:10:34,475 --> 0:10:37,512
They would go to this school,
because it's nice.


295
0:10:37,512 --> 0:10:42,417
What are y'all writing?


296
0:10:42,417 --> 0:10:44,586
- Suzanne, let's start with you.


297
0:10:44,586 --> 0:10:47,789
- Uh, first of all,
I'd just like to say,


298
0:10:47,789 --> 0:10:52,66
Before we get started,
he was just kidding.


299
0:10:52,66 --> 0:10:56,297
- Now, it says here you read
our school newspaper.


300
0:10:56,297 --> 0:10:58,299
How did that come about?


301
0:10:58,299 --> 0:11:0,34
- Well, before we get to that,


302
0:11:0,34 --> 0:11:3,371
It says here that you have
an annual school trip.


303
0:11:3,371 --> 0:11:6,24
Do you guys go to yellowstone
by any chance, and if so...


304
0:11:6,24 --> 0:11:8,142
Because there's a very real chance


305
0:11:8,142 --> 0:11:9,911
That we might encounter a bear...


306
0:11:9,911 --> 0:11:12,547
Can I bring my sword?


307
0:11:12,547 --> 0:11:15,83
- So why do you
want to come to weakly?


308
0:11:15,83 --> 0:11:16,25
- Can I be honest?


309
0:11:16,25 --> 0:11:17,885
- Please do.
- I don't.


310
0:11:17,885 --> 0:11:19,821
My parents are forcing me
to come here.


311
0:11:19,821 --> 0:11:20,855
No offense.


312
0:11:20,855 --> 0:11:22,423
I already have friends at my school,


313
0:11:22,423 --> 0:11:24,492
And there's this guy
that I really like.


314
0:11:24,492 --> 0:11:26,961
His name is Corey,
and I wouldn't see him,


315
0:11:26,961 --> 0:11:28,363
Because I would be across town.


316
0:11:28,363 --> 0:11:30,798
And I already had to move once
when my mom and dad broke up,


317
0:11:30,798 --> 0:11:32,934
But I don't want
to have to start all over again.


318
0:11:32,934 --> 0:11:34,602
And I don't know
about this uniform thing.


319
0:11:34,602 --> 0:11:37,338
I just bought
three new pairs of jeans,


320
0:11:37,338 --> 0:11:38,973
And they are really cute.


321
0:11:38,973 --> 0:11:40,408
- So when I say a word,


322
0:11:40,408 --> 0:11:42,677
Tell me the first word
that pops into your mind.


323
0:11:42,677 --> 0:11:43,678
- Got it.


324
0:11:43,678 --> 0:11:44,679
- President.


325
0:11:44,679 --> 0:11:46,581
- Obeezy.
- What?


326
0:11:46,581 --> 0:11:47,582
- Obeezy.


327
0:11:47,582 --> 0:11:49,784
You know, like, Kanye West is yeezy,


328
0:11:49,784 --> 0:11:51,919
And Lil' Wayne is wheezy,


329
0:11:51,919 --> 0:11:53,521
I always thought that if Barack Obama


330
0:11:53,521 --> 0:11:54,622
Was a hip-hop artist,


331
0:11:54,622 --> 0:11:56,524
People would call him bareezy obeezy.


332
0:11:56,524 --> 0:11:58,192
- Right.


333
0:11:58,192 --> 0:12:0,895
- Left.


334
0:12:0,895 --> 0:12:2,23
- Please tell me you're ing.


335
0:12:2,23 --> 0:12:3,364
- I wish I could.


336
0:12:3,364 --> 0:12:5,833
- So she's supposed to be your friend,


337
0:12:5,833 --> 0:12:7,235
But she calls you on a three-way


338
0:12:7,235 --> 0:12:9,303
With a guy that you like on the phone?


339
0:12:9,303 --> 0:12:10,438
- Lame, right?


340
0:12:10,438 --> 0:12:11,673
- Totally.
- I know.


341
0:12:11,673 --> 0:12:13,307
- Yeah, but there's gonna be
girls like that


342
0:12:13,307 --> 0:12:15,176
Everywhere you go,
so why not come to weakly?


343
0:12:15,176 --> 0:12:16,377
- I don't know.


344
0:12:16,377 --> 0:12:18,446
I'm still not sure about
this whole uniform thing.


345
0:12:18,446 --> 0:12:19,781
- We have free-dress Fridays.


346
0:12:19,781 --> 0:12:21,182
- Hmm.


347
0:12:21,182 --> 0:12:23,84
- Mrs. Kingston-persons,


348
0:12:23,84 --> 0:12:24,585
What would you say your mission is


349
0:12:24,585 --> 0:12:26,487
In regards to coming to weakly?


350
0:12:26,487 --> 0:12:32,56
- My mission would be to give
my children a great education.


351
0:12:32,56 --> 0:12:38,66
I hear the ones here are to die for.


352
0:12:38,66 --> 0:12:42,136
- Mm-hmm.


353
0:12:42,136 --> 0:12:46,107
Mr. Kingston-persons,
what's more important to you,


354
0:12:46,107 --> 0:12:49,777
The academic aspect of school
or the social aspect?


355
0:12:49,777 --> 0:12:51,646
- Both.


356
0:12:51,646 --> 0:12:53,448
There's nothing worse
than a brilliant guy


357
0:12:53,448 --> 0:12:54,649
With no friends.


358
0:12:54,649 --> 0:12:56,784
Can you say evil genius?


359
0:12:56,784 --> 0:12:58,586
- Can you say Facebook?


360
0:12:58,586 --> 0:12:59,62
- What?


361
0:12:59,62 --> 0:13:1,923
- The inventor of Facebook,
Mark Zuckerberg,


362
0:13:1,923 --> 0:13:3,858
The world's youngest billionaire,


363
0:13:3,858 --> 0:13:6,894
Was a brilliant college student
with no friends.


364
0:13:6,894 --> 0:13:8,83
- So was Osama bin Laden.


365
0:13:8,83 --> 0:13:11,99
- Osama bin Laden, yeah, that's funny.


366
0:13:11,99 --> 0:13:13,668
So you're equating weakly
with terrorism.


367
0:13:13,668 --> 0:13:17,438
- No, no, I'm just saying
it can go either way.


368
0:13:17,438 --> 0:13:20,41
I mean, like,
Stephen and Alec Baldwin,


369
0:13:20,41 --> 0:13:22,443
You know, same background,
two different dudes.


370
0:13:22,443 --> 0:13:24,278
- You know,
the baldwins went to weakly.


371
0:13:24,278 --> 0:13:26,314
- Really?


372
0:13:26,314 --> 0:13:37,825
- No.


373
0:13:37,825 --> 0:13:39,293
- Oh, hey, Gigi.


374
0:13:39,293 --> 0:13:40,561
- Hey, hey.


375
0:13:40,561 --> 0:13:43,3
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
where have you been?


376
0:13:43,3 --> 0:13:46,601
- Gigi, he had his school
interview today, remember?


377
0:13:46,601 --> 0:13:47,835
- You know what?


378
0:13:47,835 --> 0:13:49,771
His future might be important to you,


379
0:13:49,771 --> 0:13:52,73
But his present, it's important to me.


380
0:13:52,73 --> 0:13:53,608
Let's go. We have a photo shoot.


381
0:13:53,608 --> 0:13:55,61
- How can you be a stage mom?


382
0:13:55,61 --> 0:13:57,311
You're not even a mother.


383
0:13:57,311 --> 0:13:58,546
- Yes, she is.
- Hey.


384
0:13:58,546 --> 0:14:0,181
- Nick, stop it.
- Let's go.


385
0:14:0,181 --> 0:14:1,716
- Mom, how are you just gonna let...


386
0:14:1,716 --> 0:14:3,651
- Boy, I'm paying you. Upstairs.


387
0:14:3,651 --> 0:14:9,39
Ring a bell?


388
0:14:9,39 --> 0:14:11,592
- Baby, it's here.
- What?


389
0:14:11,592 --> 0:14:12,593
- The letter from weakly.


390
0:14:12,593 --> 0:14:13,928
- Oh.


391
0:14:13,928 --> 0:14:15,129
- Ohhh, yeah.


392
0:14:15,129 --> 0:14:16,564
Here we go.


393
0:14:16,564 --> 0:14:18,699
<i>Congratulations.</i>


394
0:14:18,699 --> 0:14:20,201
<i>we have carefully considered</i>


395
0:14:20,201 --> 0:14:22,203
<i>your applications for admission
to weakly prep</i>


396
0:14:22,203 --> 0:14:23,871
<i>and are proud to inform you</i>


397
0:14:23,871 --> 0:14:26,641
<i>that you will be placed
on our waiting list</i>


398
0:14:26,641 --> 0:14:30,77
<i>for possible admission next semester.</i>


399
0:14:30,77 --> 0:14:31,879
- Next semester?


400
0:14:31,879 --> 0:14:46,692
- <i>Thank you for your interest
in weakly prep</i>.


401
0:14:46,692 --> 0:14:48,995
- Maybe it's a mix-up.


402
0:14:48,995 --> 0:14:51,297
- Are you kidding me? Seriously?


403
0:14:51,297 --> 0:14:54,1
Nick, they don't want us,
which is fine e by me,


404
0:14:54,1 --> 0:14:56,168
Because I didn't want to do this
in the first place.


405
0:14:56,168 --> 0:14:57,637
- Look, you know what?


406
0:14:57,637 --> 0:14:58,838
They didn't get rejected.


407
0:14:58,838 --> 0:15:0,172
I mean, they're on a wait list.


408
0:15:0,172 --> 0:15:3,75
- Wait for what, till they
graduate from another school?


409
0:15:3,75 --> 0:15:5,912
Now, you can keep drinking
the kool-aid if you want to,


410
0:15:5,912 --> 0:15:8,18
But I will not keep putting
my kids through this.


411
0:15:8,18 --> 0:15:10,49
- Aww, you watch.


412
0:15:10,49 --> 0:15:11,317
It'll be real good.


413
0:15:11,317 --> 0:15:13,419
You gonna help me with the bags?


414
0:15:13,419 --> 0:15:23,696
- Sure. I'll put it on my wait list.


415
0:15:23,696 --> 0:15:24,864
- Kevin, let's go.


416
0:15:24,864 --> 0:15:26,666
We have a photo shoot in 30 minutes.


417
0:15:26,666 --> 0:15:27,733
- Not so fast.


418
0:15:27,733 --> 0:15:29,168
I've been doing a little research,


419
0:15:29,168 --> 0:15:31,27
And I think there's a couple
things we need to discuss.


420
0:15:31,27 --> 0:15:33,5
- Okay, well,
we can discuss that in the car.


421
0:15:33,5 --> 0:15:34,407
Let's go.


422
0:15:34,407 --> 0:15:36,575
- Did you know that the entire
amount of money you paid me


423
0:15:36,575 --> 0:15:39,211
Is less than what most
male models make in an hour?


424
0:15:39,211 --> 0:15:40,413
- They're grown.


425
0:15:40,413 --> 0:15:41,914
You're not union.


426
0:15:41,914 --> 0:15:44,583
- Union scale is still about
fives times what I'm being paid.


427
0:15:44,583 --> 0:15:45,718
- You agreed to the price.


428
0:15:45,718 --> 0:15:47,253
- You took advantage of me.


429
0:15:47,253 --> 0:15:48,421
- No, I didn't.


430
0:15:48,421 --> 0:15:50,122
I didn't know anything
about those rules.


431
0:15:50,122 --> 0:15:51,457
- You do now.


432
0:15:51,457 --> 0:15:54,327
- So what are you saying?


433
0:15:54,327 --> 0:15:55,528
- All I'm saying is,


434
0:15:55,528 --> 0:15:57,596
Since we're only halfway
through the project


435
0:15:57,596 --> 0:15:58,764
And you need the other half done


436
0:15:58,764 --> 0:16:0,399
Before you can deliver
to your clients,


437
0:16:0,399 --> 0:16:3,302
I have what is called
a bargaining chip.


438
0:16:3,302 --> 0:16:7,173
- And what exactly do you intend
to use this bargaining chip for?


439
0:16:7,173 --> 0:16:10,91
- For two new video games
in addition to the cash.


440
0:16:10,91 --> 0:16:12,778
- How much are they?


441
0:16:12,778 --> 0:16:14,613
- More than $50, less than a lawsuit.


442
0:16:14,613 --> 0:16:16,182
- You cannot sue me.


443
0:16:16,182 --> 0:16:18,651
- Not me, your clients.


444
0:16:18,651 --> 0:16:23,122
- Fine. Deal, Kevin.


445
0:16:23,122 --> 0:16:25,224
And does your mother know
how evil you are?


446
0:16:25,224 --> 0:16:27,927
- No, and if you know
what's best for you,


447
0:16:27,927 --> 0:16:35,1
You'll keep it that way.


448
0:16:35,1 --> 0:16:36,769
- We are so happy to have you with us.


449
0:16:36,769 --> 0:16:38,7
We are beside ourselves.


450
0:16:38,7 --> 0:16:41,841
Here we are, and here we are
beside ourselves.


451
0:16:41,841 --> 0:16:43,909
<i>Domo arigato.</i>
- Thank you.


452
0:16:43,909 --> 0:16:45,277
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.


453
0:16:45,277 --> 0:16:46,612
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.


454
0:16:46,612 --> 0:16:47,747
<i>Domo, domo.</i>


455
0:16:47,747 --> 0:16:49,181
- Devon, can I talk to you
for a moment?


456
0:16:49,181 --> 0:16:50,583
- I'll be with you in just a moment,


457
0:16:50,583 --> 0:16:51,55
Mr. Kingston-persons.


458
0:16:51,55 --> 0:16:52,818
Thank you so much. Baby?


459
0:16:52,818 --> 0:16:54,286
- Do you guys like Chinese?


460
0:16:54,286 --> 0:16:58,57
Because I know a place
that is to die for.


461
0:16:58,57 --> 0:17:4,463
- Thank you.


462
0:17:4,463 --> 0:17:7,199
N.K.P., what it do? What it do?


463
0:17:7,199 --> 0:17:9,235
- Oh, now it's N.K.P.?


464
0:17:9,235 --> 0:17:11,37
Last time, it was D.O.A.


465
0:17:11,37 --> 0:17:12,772
- D...


466
0:17:12,772 --> 0:17:16,275
Ahh, lol, omg.


467
0:17:16,275 --> 0:17:17,71
Oh, come on.


468
0:17:17,71 --> 0:17:19,245
I hope this little dog and pony show


469
0:17:19,245 --> 0:17:20,279
Didn't get to you.


470
0:17:20,279 --> 0:17:21,58
You know how it is.


471
0:17:21,58 --> 0:17:23,182
- No, I don't.


472
0:17:23,182 --> 0:17:27,119
Why don't you tell me how it is,
D. E.V...O.N.?


473
0:17:27,119 --> 0:17:29,655
- Look, man, I want you in here
as much as anybody,


474
0:17:29,655 --> 0:17:31,23
But this board is tough,


475
0:17:31,23 --> 0:17:33,225
So I had to play the bad cop
so they didn't think


476
0:17:33,225 --> 0:17:35,494
I was trying to get somebody
in here who didn't belong.


477
0:17:35,494 --> 0:17:37,563
- Yeah? Well, it worked.


478
0:17:37,563 --> 0:17:39,565
- Congratulations. You in.


479
0:17:39,565 --> 0:17:40,633
- We didn't get in.


480
0:17:40,633 --> 0:17:41,767
We're on the wait list.


481
0:17:41,767 --> 0:17:44,336
- Oh.


482
0:17:44,336 --> 0:17:46,672
I may have laid it on
a little too thick.


483
0:17:46,672 --> 0:17:47,74
You ever done that,


484
0:17:47,74 --> 0:17:49,742
Just lean into it a little too hard?


485
0:17:49,742 --> 0:17:51,61
- No.


486
0:17:51,61 --> 0:17:52,945
- Okay, you know what?


487
0:17:52,945 --> 0:17:54,413
I'll talk to a few people.


488
0:17:54,413 --> 0:17:55,648
- You're the head of the board.


489
0:17:55,648 --> 0:17:57,249
Who are you gonna talk to? You?


490
0:17:57,249 --> 0:17:58,384
- Nick, I know you're upset.


491
0:17:58,384 --> 0:17:59,752
- Yeah, I'm upset.


492
0:17:59,752 --> 0:18:1,821
Man, you got me down here.


493
0:18:1,821 --> 0:18:4,29
Look, my kids are fine where they are.


494
0:18:4,29 --> 0:18:5,958
They don't need weakly, and obviously,


495
0:18:5,958 --> 0:18:6,992
Weakly doesn't need them.


496
0:18:6,992 --> 0:18:8,861
- Nick, I'm gonna t.


497
0:18:8,861 --> 0:18:10,729
You might like it. You might not.


498
0:18:10,729 --> 0:18:12,98
- Really?


499
0:18:12,98 --> 0:18:14,2
- If there was a problem,
it wasn't with the children.


500
0:18:14,2 --> 0:18:16,368
I talked to the counselors.
They loved them.


501
0:18:16,368 --> 0:18:19,405
- Then who was the problem with?


502
0:18:19,405 --> 0:18:20,806
Me?


503
0:18:20,806 --> 0:18:22,308
Oh, there's something wrong with me?


504
0:18:22,308 --> 0:18:23,609
- Nick Diesel, let me be honest.


505
0:18:23,609 --> 0:18:25,277
You have a bad attitude.


506
0:18:25,277 --> 0:18:26,745
- I have a bad attitude


507
0:18:26,745 --> 0:18:28,681
Because you and your wife
brought me and Suzanne


508
0:18:28,681 --> 0:18:29,748
in front of the board


509
0:18:29,748 --> 0:18:31,25
And acted like
you weren't in our house


510
0:18:31,25 --> 0:18:33,686
Eating collard Greens
and chicken a week earlier.


511
0:18:33,686 --> 0:18:35,754
Look, if you had introduced us
to the board


512
0:18:35,754 --> 0:18:37,456
Like you wanted us in, we'd be in.


513
0:18:37,456 --> 0:18:38,791
- Nick, wait, wait.


514
0:18:38,791 --> 0:18:39,892
Please, reconsider.


515
0:18:39,892 --> 0:18:42,161
Look, I admit it.


516
0:18:42,161 --> 0:18:44,396
I overdid it.


517
0:18:44,396 --> 0:18:47,967
I'll talk to the board.


518
0:18:47,967 --> 0:18:50,136
- You got a lot of faces, man.


519
0:18:50,136 --> 0:18:53,105
Pick one, and stick with it.


520
0:18:53,105 --> 0:18:55,341
- You're kidding, right?


521
0:18:55,341 --> 0:18:56,675
Oh, you're kidding.


522
0:18:56,675 --> 0:18:58,344
You're... Nick.


523
0:18:58,344 --> 0:18:59,945
N.K.P.


524
0:18:59,945 --> 0:19:4,984
Ni... okay, walk out,
and he's gonna come back in.


525
0:19:4,984 --> 0:19:14,867
Okay.


526
0:19:14,867 --> 0:19:16,902
- How'd the smack down go?


527
0:19:16,902 --> 0:19:19,972
- That fool tapped out.


528
0:19:19,972 --> 0:19:21,473
- You want a sandwich?


529
0:19:21,473 --> 0:19:22,841
- Yeah, I'll take one.


530
0:19:22,841 --> 0:19:24,343
- Well, you just have to have


531
0:19:24,343 --> 0:19:25,978
the Turkey, lettuce, and tomatoes


532
0:19:25,978 --> 0:19:27,78
with the spicy mustard.


533
0:19:27,78 --> 0:19:30,582
It's to die for.


534
0:19:30,582 --> 0:19:33,252
You know, I thought Devon was cool.


535
0:19:33,252 --> 0:19:34,787
- Honey, he's a salesman.


536
0:19:34,787 --> 0:19:35,954
He just sold you.


537
0:19:35,954 --> 0:19:38,357
- Man, you make it sound so dirty.


538
0:19:38,357 --> 0:19:40,659
- Nick, don't feel bad.


539
0:19:40,659 --> 0:19:43,362
You have this tendency
to see the best in people.


540
0:19:43,362 --> 0:19:44,897
It's what you do.


541
0:19:44,897 --> 0:19:46,899
I feel like you saw the best in me,


542
0:19:46,899 --> 0:19:48,967
even when I didn't see it in myself.


543
0:19:48,967 --> 0:19:51,603
So occasionally,
if you have to be hoodwinked,


544
0:19:51,603 --> 0:19:53,739
Bamboozled, run amok,
played, suckered,


545
0:19:53,739 --> 0:19:54,84
Punked, hustled...


546
0:19:54,84 --> 0:19:55,974
- Are you through?


547
0:19:55,974 --> 0:19:56,975
- No, I got a couple more:


548
0:19:56,975 --> 0:19:58,711
Carried, dissed, mugged, had,


549
0:19:58,711 --> 0:20:0,179
Or just plain turned out...


550
0:20:0,179 --> 0:20:1,48
- Turned out?


551
0:20:1,48 --> 0:20:3,682
It's a school application,
not a prison assault.


552
0:20:3,682 --> 0:20:5,484
- Well, next time,


553
0:20:5,484 --> 0:20:8,354
If you just listen to me
in the first place,


554
0:20:8,354 --> 0:20:10,356
You wouldn't be in this position.


555
0:20:10,356 --> 0:20:11,49
- I hate it when you're right.


556
0:20:11,49 --> 0:20:12,524
- Mm.


557
0:20:12,524 --> 0:20:13,759
- And I don't like you right now.


558
0:20:13,759 --> 0:20:17,463
- Mm, and yet you're still here.


559
0:20:17,463 --> 0:20:18,964
- I don't want to talk about it.


560
0:20:18,964 --> 0:20:22,401
- Oh, Kevin,
the pictures came out cute.


561
0:20:22,401 --> 0:20:24,303
- I don't want to talk about it, Gigi.


562
0:20:24,303 --> 0:20:26,38
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.


563
0:20:26,38 --> 0:20:27,906
Kevin made me look great
in front of the client,


564
0:20:27,906 --> 0:20:29,875
But now he doesn't want anyone
to see the pictures.


565
0:20:29,875 --> 0:20:32,244
- Hey, man, come on, Kev,
show us the pictures.


566
0:20:32,244 --> 0:20:34,88
- People are gonna see them
anyway when the frames come out.


567
0:20:34,88 --> 0:20:38,183
- Fine, but no video game
is worth this.


568
0:20:38,183 --> 0:20:41,19
- Here we go.


569
0:20:41,19 --> 0:20:44,123
- Ohh, baby.


570
0:20:44,123 --> 0:20:45,924
- Ohh, look at your head.


571
0:20:45,924 --> 0:20:47,826
- He's so cute.


572
0:20:47,826 --> 0:20:50,195
- Look at that head.


573
0:20:50,195 --> 0:20:53,17
That head is...
