###32 DITULLIO: HI EVERYONE AND
###33 WELCOME TO RIT SPORTSZONE. I'M
###34 JOHN DITULLIO. HILL: AND I'M
###35 SHELBY HILL. TODAY SPORTSZONE
###36 REACHES A MAJOR MILESTONE AS WE
###38 KICK OFF OUR TENTH SEASON RIGHT
###40 HERE IN THE BRICK CITY.
###41 DITULLIO: YOU KNOW, SHELBY, OVER
###42 THE LAST TWO YEARS THE RIT MENS'
###43 HOCKEY TEAM EXPERIENCED A FEW
###45 MAJOR MILESTONES OF ITS OWN. TWO
###46 YEARS AGO THE TIGERS CLINCHED
###48 THEIR FIRST TRIP TO THE NCAA
###49 TOURNAMENT NAD REACHED THEIR
###51 FIRST FROZEN FOUR IN SCHOOL
###53 HISTORY. HILL: AS EMILY CLARK
###54 REPORTS, LAST SEASON A FORMER
###56 TIGER CONTINUED RIT'S STRING OF
###58 FIRSTS WHEN HE REACHED THE
###61 HIGHEST LEVEL IN HOCKEY. CLARK:
###67 LAST SEASON FORMER RIT HOCKEY
###69 PLAYER CHRIS TANEV WAS PRESENTED
###71 AN OPPORTUNITY MOST PLAYERS ONLY
###74 DREAM OF. AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL
###75 FOLLOWING HIS FRESHMAN YEAR,
###77 TANEV BRIEFLY TOOK THE ICE WITH
###80 THE AHL'S MANITOBA MOOSE, BEFORE
###82 RECEIVING A CALL UP TO THE NHL'S
###84 VANCOUVER CANUCKS. TANEV: IT WAS
###86 A LOT OF FUN. I WAS VERY EXCITED
###88 AND I HAD A BALL UP THERE. IT
###90 WAS A DREAM COME TRUE. CLARK:
###91 WHAT WAS IT LIKE PLAYING IN YOUR
###92 FIRST PRO GAME AND WHAT WAS
###93 RUNNING THROUGH YOUR MIND?
###95 TANEV: JUST TRYING NOT TO MAKE A
###96 MISTAKE OUT THERE AND JUST
###97 TRYING TO HAVE FUN AND ENJOY THE
###100 MOMENT. CLARK: BUT THE MOMENT
###102 AND THE GAME WERE CLEARLY
###103 DIFFERENT FROM HIS DAYS AT RIT.
###106 TANEV: THE GAMES ARE MORE
###107 CONTROLLED; THE GUYS ARE BIGGER.
###109 YOU HAVE TO PLAY YOUR POSITION
###113 BASICALLY TO A T AND NOT DEVIATE
###115 FROM THE GAME PLAN AND IT'S JUST
###117 A LITTLE BIT OF A STEP UP.
###122 CLARK: SO HOW DO YOU STAY SO
###123 FOCUSED AND SO CALM WITH ALL THE
###125 PRESSURE AND ATTENTION? TANEV:
###126 IT'S JUST HOW I PLAY AND DO
###128 NOTHING SPECIAL. IT'S HOW MY
###130 PERSONALITY IS AND I JUST TRY TO
###133 ENJOY THE GAME AND IT'S JUST
###135 HOCKEY WHEN YOU GET ON THE ICE.
###137 CLARK: TANEV PLAYED IN 29
###140 REGULAR SEASON GAMES. HE EVEN
###141 TOOK THE ICE IN THE PLAYOFFS AND
###143 CAME WITHIN ONE WIN OF HOCKEY'S
###145 TOP PRIZE, THE STANLEY CUP. SO
###147 HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO GET TO
###149 THAT POINT IN THE STANLEY CUP
###150 FINALS? TANEV: IT'S VERY
###152 DIFFICULT. THERE ARE 32 TEAMS
###154 AND YOU PLAY 82 GAMES IN THE
###156 REGULAR SEASON AND THEN YOU'VE
###158 GOT TO WIN ANOTHER 16 TO WIN THE
###161 STANLEY CUP SO IT'S A LONG GRIND
###163 AND IT'S TOUGH ON YOUR BODY, BUT
###166 THAT'S WHY YOU'RE PLAYING, TO
###168 WIN THE STANLEY CUP AND WE CAME
###170 REAL CLOSE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE
###174 DIDN'T WIN. YOU OBVIOUSLY WANT
###180 TO WIN ONE OF THOSE LAST TWO
###183 GAMES AND WIN THE STANLEY CUP,
###185 BUT YOU TAKE IT AS A LEARNING
###186 EXPERIENCE AND AFTER A FEW DAYS
###188 PASS BY, IT'S SOMETHING YOU'LL
###190 ALWAYS REMEMBER BUT HOPEFULLY
###191 YOU'LL LEARN FROM IT AND GET
###192 THERE IN THE FUTURE AGAIN.
###194 CLARK: AS ONE OF THE YOUNGEST
###195 PLAYERS IN THE LEAGUE, TANEV IS
###196 HOPEFUL THIS IS JUST THE START
###198 OF WHAT HAS ALMOST FELT SURREAL.
###201 SO WHEN YOU TOOK YOUR FIRST STEP
###202 ON THE RIT CAMPUS, DID YOU EVER
###204 DREAM THAT EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE
###207 HAPPENED AS IT HAS HOCKEY WISE
###209 IN THE PAST YEAR FOR YOU? TANEV:
###211 NO, I DEFINITELY DIDN'T THINK IT
###213 WOULD HAPPEN. IT'S BEEN PRETTY
###214 CRAZY. IT'S BEEN A WILD RIDE AND
###218 HOPEFULLY I'LL IMPROVE MY GAME
###219 AND GET BETTER ON THE ICE.
###220 CLARK: THE CANUCKS MANAGEMENT
###222 TALK SO HIGHLY OF YOU; DO YOU
###223 EXPECT TO BE STARTING WITH THEM
###224 NEXT SEASON OR BACK IN THE AHL?
###227 TANEV: I'M JUST GOING TO BE
###228 WORKING HARD ALL SUMMER, GET TO
###229 TRAINING CAMP AND DO MY BEST OUT
###230 THERE. I'M GOING TO TRY AND MAKE
###232 THE BIG CLUB AND HOPEFULLY I DO,
###234 BUT IF I DON'T, THAT'S FINE. I
###237 DEFINITELY NEED TO GET STRONGER,
###239 DEFINITELY NEED TO IMPROVE MY
###240 SHOT AND THERE'S DEFINITELY
###243 PARTS OF MY GAME THAT I NEED TO
###246 IMPROVE A LOT TO BE THERE THE
###247 WHOLE YEAR OR BE THERE EVEN FOR
###249 A LITTLE BIT. HILL: IN ADDITION
###252 TO CHRIS TANEV, FOUR OTHER
###254 FORMER TIGERS WERE INVITED TO
###257 NHL TRAINING CAMPS THIS FALL.
###258 DITULLIO: STEVE (INAUDIBLE)
###259 JOINED TANEV IN CAMP WITH THE
###260 CANUCKS. TYLER BRENNER SKATED
###261 WITH THE TORONTO MAPLELEAFS,
###263 BOBBY RAYMOND WAS WITH OTTAWA,
###264 WHILE GOALTENDER JARED DEMICHAEL
###266 ATTENDED CAMP WITH THE DEFENDING
###268 STANLEY CUP CHAMPION BOSTON
###272 BRUINS. STILL TO COME ON
###274 SPORTSZONE: THREE RIT STUDENTS
###276 GO ON A JOURNEY OF A LIFETIME
###278 AND THE TIGERS EARN THE TOP SPOT
###280 BEFORE THE PUCK EVEN DROPS ON
###282 THE NEW SEASON. NEW SPEAKER:
###300 HOCKEY. DITULLIO: THE LAST FIVE
###302 SEASONS RIT AND AIR FORCE HAVE
###304 OWNED THE ATLANTIC HOCKEY
###305 ASSOCIATION SO IT SHOULD BE NO
###307 SURPRISE THAT THE DEFENDING
###308 REGULAR SEASON CHAMPION TIGERS
###310 AND TOURNAMENT CHAMPION FALCONS
###311 ARE ONCE AGAIN PICKED TO FINISH
###313 ATOP THE AHA STANDINGS. OUR VERY
###315 OWN SHELBY HILL CAUGHT UP WITH
###316 THE TIGERS AND PREVIEWS THE
###328 UPCOMING SEASON. HILL: LAST
###330 YEAR, HOW UPSETTING WAS IT TO
###331 WATCH AIR FORCE CONTINUE AND SEE
###333 YOUR SEASON KIND OF END
###334 ABRUPTLY? WILSON: THAT WAS
###336 REALLY DISAPPOINTING. SOME
###337 PEOPLE WERE ASKING IF IT STUNG,
###339 THE DEFEAT, BUT IT WAS JUST
###341 DISAPPOINTING WHENEVER YOUR LAST
###343 GAME ENDS WITH A LOSS, BUT
###346 HAVING SAID THAT, I WAS REALLY
###347 HAPPY WITH THE WAY WE PLAYED IN
###349 THAT PARTICULAR GAME. WE OUTSHOT
###350 THEM PRETTY BAD AND LOST ONE
###352 NOTHING. WE JUST COULDN'T SCORE
###354 A GOAL AND HAD A BIT OF A
###356 HANGOVER FROM THAT LOSS FOR A
###357 LITTLE BIT. NEW SPEAKER: THE
###358 FEELING AT THE END OF THE GAME
###359 LAST YEAR, LOSING ONE NOTHING IN
###361 FRONT OF OUR HOME CROWD AT BLUEN
###363 CROSS, IT'S JUST NOT A GREAT
###367 FEELING AT ALL AND IT'S HARD TO
###368 DESCRIBE. HILL: AND SO ARE YOU
###369 GOING TO USE THAT LOSS AS
###370 MOTIVATION FOR THIS YEAR? NEW
###371 SPEAKER: DEFINITELY. THEY'RE ONE
###373 OF THE TEAMS THAT WE LOOK TO
###374 BEAT EVERY YEAR AND THEY'RE ONE
###376 OF THE STRONGER TEAMS IN OUR
###377 DIVISION SO I MEAN, IT'S
###378 DEFINITELY GOING TO BE
###380 MOTIVATION AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN
###381 GET THE WIN BACK AND MAKE IT
###382 BACK TO THE TOURNAMENT. HILL:
###383 YOU LOST SOME PRETTY GREAT
###384 SENIORS LAST YEAR. HOW'S THE
###385 TEAM MAKING UP FOR THEM? NEW
###386 SPEAKER: JUST BRINGING IN A GOOD
###387 RECRUITING CLASS WITH THE
###388 FRESHMEN CLASS. FROM WHAT I'VE
###390 SEEN SO FAR, THEY CAN PLAY AT
###392 THE SAME LEVEL THAT OUR SENIORS
###393 HAVE PLAYED. WE'VE JUST GOT TO
###395 WAIT AND SEE WHO'S GOING TO STOP
###396 UP THIS YEAR AND WHO'S GOING TO
###398 SORT OF FILL THOSE ROLES OF LIKE
###400 FAVOT AND BRENNER AND THOSE TYPE
###402 OF PLAYERS. NEW SPEAKER: WE LOST
###403 OUR TOP TWO GOAL SCORERS AND
###405 POINT GETTERS, WE LOST OUR GREAT
###406 ROLE PLAYERS WITH SEAN MURPHY
###408 AND MIKE JANDA AND YANNI. JUST
###410 FIVE GREAT GUYS, ALWAYS IN THE
###412 LOCKER ROOM, THE LOUDEST AND
###414 MOST POSITIVE, SO IT'S GOING TO
###415 BE TOUGH TO REPLACE THEM, BUT I
###417 THINK MY SENIOR CLASS WILL DO A
###418 PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT. HILL: SO
###420 CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE
###421 FRESHMEN? WILSON: WELL, IT'S
###423 GOING TO BE INTERESTING HOW THEY
###424 ADAPT. WE'VE GOT STARTING IN
###426 GOAL JORDAN RUBY, THAT COMES IN
###429 VERY HIGHLY THOUGHT OF. WE
###430 CERTAINLY THINK A LOT OF HIM AND
###431 I THINK HE'S GOING TO CHALLENGE
###434 TWO GOALIES IN SHANE AND JOSH
###435 THAT HAVE REALLY DONE VERY WELL
###437 FOR US. ON DEFENSE, WE BROUGHT
###439 IN ONE DEFENSEMAN TO JOIN THE
###441 SEVEN THAT WE RETURNED, SO IT'S
###443 GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT TASK FOR
###445 STU BROWNELL WHO'S IN THAT
###446 POSITION, BUT SOMEONE THAT WE
###448 BELIEVE IN AND IS GOING TO HELP
###449 US THIS YEAR AND IF NOT THIS
###451 YEAR, IN OUR FUTURE YEARS. NEW
###453 SPEAKER: DEFINITELY HAVE A LOT
###454 OF CONFIDENCE IN THEM, JUST FROM
###455 THE FEW SCRIMMAGES THAT WE'VE
###457 HAD AND THE CAPTAIN'S PRACTICES.
###458 THEY LOOK PRETTY GOOD. EACH OF
###459 THEM BRING SOMETHING DIFFERENT
###461 TO THE TABLE. I HAVE A GOOD
###462 FEELING THAT THEY'LL STEP RIGHT
###464 IN AND FILL SOME HOLES FOR US
###468 AND START THEIR LEARNING CURVE
###469 AND THEIR GROWTH FROM DAY ONE.
###472 NEW SPEAKER: THE FRESHMEN ARE
###474 VERY GOOD THIS YEAR; I'M VERY
###475 EXCITED. THIS YEAR'S PROBABLY
###477 THE MOST EXCITED I'VE BEEN OUT
###479 OF THE TWO PREVIOUS YEARS ABOUT
###481 OUR FRESHMEN COMING IN. THEY'RE
###482 VERY SKILLED AND ALL OF THEM CAN
###484 STEP IN AND PLAY RIGHT AWAY.
###485 HILL: AND AS A SENIOR YOU'VE
###486 SEEN THIS TEAM GROW. WHAT DO YOU
###487 THINK ARE SOME OF YOUR STRENGTHS
###489 AND WEAKNESSES? NEW SPEAKER: I
###490 THINK ONE OF OUR BIGGEST
###491 STRENGTHS IS OUR TEAM DEFENSE. I
###492 THINK WE PLAY PRETTY GOOD IN THE
###494 DEFENSIVE ZONE AND OUR
###495 GOALTENDING'S BEEN PHENOMENAL
###497 EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE AND I
###498 CAN SEE IT CONTINUE TO GROW WITH
###499 RUBY AND WATSON TAKING OVER WHEN
###502 SHANE LEAVES. OUR OFFENSE HAS
###504 ALWAYS BEEN PRETTY TOP NOTCH,
###506 BUT I THINK SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE
###507 OUR TEAM DEFENSE HAS PROGRESSED
###509 PRETTY WELL. NEW SPEAKER: I
###510 THINK SOME OF OUR STRENGTHS
###511 WOULD DEFINITELY BE OUR SPEED,
###512 AGAIN, THAT'S ALWAYS ONE OF OUR
###514 STRENGTHS EVERY YEAR IS OUR
###516 SPEED, AND OUR PLAYMAKING AND
###518 OUR WORK ETHIC ARE HUGE
###519 STRENGTHS. AND THEN SOME OF OUR
###521 WEAKNESSES PROBABLY ARE GOING TO
###524 BE GOAL SCORING AND STUFF LIKE
###525 THAT, LOSING BRENNER, LIKE I
###526 SAID, WHERE HE SCORED A LOT OF
###528 GOALS FOR US LAST YEAR AND OVER
###530 HIS CAREER, SO WE'RE GOING TO
###532 HAVE TO SEE WHO'S GOING TO FILL
###533 THOSE VOIDS AND SCORE SOME
###534 GOALS. HILL: SO WHAT ARE YOUR
###535 EXPECTATIONS FOR THE TEAM THIS
###537 SEASON? WILSON: OUR GOAL IS TO
###538 GO TO THE NCAA'S. YOU KNOW, WE
###541 SAY THAT RESPECTFULLY TO ALL OF
###543 OUR OPPONENTS IN THAT WE KNOW
###544 WE'RE GOING TO GET STIFF
###546 COMPETITION AND IT'S A VERY
###548 TOUGH THING TO ACCOMPLISH. NEW
###549 SPEAKER: DEFINITELY SAME AS LAST
###552 YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE: GET
###553 BACK INTO THE NCAA TOURNAMENT.
###554 IT'S ALWAYS BEEN OUR GOAL SINCE
###555 I'VE BEEN HERE AND I THINK IF WE
###559 JUST KEEP THAT IN OUR MINDS,
###561 WE'LL ACHIEVE IT. I KNOW WE CAME
###562 UP SHORT LAST YEAR AND THEN TWO
###563 YEARS AGO WHEN WE WENT TO THE
###564 FROZEN FOUR WAS JUST A MAGICAL
###565 THING, BUT WE DEFINITELY NEED
###568 TO, AND WILL, GET BACK TO THE
###573 NCAA TOURNAMENT. DITULLIO: NOW
###576 DON'T FORGET THAT RIT SPORTSZONE
###578 IS ONCE AGAIN YOUR HOME FOR
###580 HOCKEY THIS SEASON. HEAD TO
###582 RITSZ.COM AND CLICK ON HOCKEY

###609 BASEBALL COACH. DURING HIS
###611 TENURE, GROW HAS WON MORE GAMES
###613 THAN ANY OF HIS PREDECESSORS AND
###614 WHILE SELLING RIT AND THE
###616 BASEBALL PROGRAM TO POTENTIAL
###617 RECRUITS HAS NEVER BEEN A
###619 PROBLEM BEFORE, IT'S AN EVEN
###621 EASIER SELL NOW. SPORTSZONE'S
###623 JEFF BLOSSETT EXPLAINS.
###632 BLOSSETT: ROB GROW'S MESSAGE TO
###633 RECRUITS THESE DAYS IS PLAIN AND
###635 SIMPLE: GROW: YOU WANT TO LIVE
###636 THE DREAM? COME HERE AND WE'LL
###638 GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO LEARN FROM
###640 GUYS THAT KNOW HOW TO GET THERE.
###641 BLOSSETT: GREG KEAGLE AND R.D.
###642 LONG BRING A WEALTH OF
###645 EXPERIENCE TO RIT. GROW: IF YOU
###647 WANT TO BE A PITCHER, GREG WILL
###648 MAKE YOU THE BEST POSSIBLE
###649 PITCHER. IF YOU'RE A POSITION
###650 PLAYER, R.D.'S GOING TO GET YOU
###651 BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER,
###652 BIGGER AND STRONGER, FASTER,
###653 BETTER BASEBALL PLAYER, SO WE'VE
###655 GOT GUYS THAT CAN GIVE YOU A
###657 PATH TO PLAY BEYOND COLLEGE NOW,
###658 SO WHEN WE'RE RECRUITING NOW, WE
###660 TALK TO KIDS ABOUT THE ACADEMIC
###661 OPPORTUNITIES, THE CO OP, HOW
###664 GREAT RIT IS ACADEMICALLY, BUT
###665 WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO TALK
###666 ABOUT THAT. NOW WE'RE ABLE TO
###668 ADD ON ON THAT LEVEL OF, IF YOU
###669 WANT TO PLAY AFTER COLLEGE,
###670 WE'VE GOT GUYS HERE THAT CAN
###670 HELP YOU GET THERE TOO.
###671 BLOSSETT: KEAGLE PITCHED
###673 PROFESSIONALLY FOR ELEVEN YEARS,
###674 INCLUDING THREE SEASONS IN THE
###675 MAJORS WITH THE DETROIT TIGERS.
###682 KEAGLE: NOTHING THAT I TALK
###683 ABOUT I INVENTED. IT'S ALL
###685 THINGS I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO
###686 LISTEN TO OTHER COACHES THAT HAD
###687 BEEN AROUND THE GAME A LONG
###689 TIME. IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO
###691 REALIZE THAT IF YOU CAN SLOW
###692 THIS GAME DOWN, YOU'RE GOING TO
###693 BE A LOT MORE PRODUCTIVE AND A
###695 LOT MORE SUCCESSFUL, AND I THINK
###696 THAT FOR YOUNG PLAYERS, THAT'S
###697 THE HARDEST THING. I THINK THAT
###699 THE EXPERIENCES THAT WE WERE
###701 ABLE TO HAVE ALLOWS US TO
###702 HOPEFULLY INFLUENCE THE YOUNGER
###704 PLAYERS AND THE COLLEGE LEVEL
###704 ATHLETE TO EXPLAIN TO THEM,
###705 "LOOK, WE'VE STRUCK OUT; WE'VE
###708 GIVEN UP HOME RUNS. WE'VE MADE
###709 MISTAKES." AND I THINK TO BE
###710 ABLE TO EXPLAIN THAT TO THEM
###712 THAT YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY,
###715 AGAIN, I'M THROWING QUITE A FEW
###716 CLICHÉS AROUND, BUT IT'S NOT
###717 WHETHER YOU GET KNOCKED DOWN,
###718 BUT WHETHER YOU GET UP.
###720 BLOSSETT: COACH LONG WORKS WITH
###721 RIT'S POSITION PLAYERS. HE
###722 PLAYED SIX SEASONS IN THE
###724 YANKEES MINOR LEAGUE SYSTEM,
###726 WHERE HE DEVELOPED A TIRELESS
###727 WORK ETHIC, THANKS TO FUTURE
###728 HALL OF FAMER DEREK JETER. LONG:
###731 DEREK JETER BY FAR, BY FAR, IT'S
###737 SO BY FAR, INFLUENCED ME IN SUCH
###739 A WAY IT'S UNBELIEVABLE AS FAR
###740 AS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. I
###743 STARTED GOING THROUGH A WORKOUT
###746 PROGRAM EVERY DAY WITH HIM,
###747 WHICH WAS A WEIGHT TRAINING
###749 PROGRAM. FIRST WE'D GO ON THE
###751 FIELD AT 9, WE'D DO ALL OF OUR
###753 STUFF UNTIL 12, WE'D GO INTO THE
###755 WEIGHT ROOM AT 1 AND LIFT UNTIL
###757 3 O'CLOCK. I HAD NEVER DONE
###759 ANYTHING LIKE THAT RELIGIOUSLY.
###763 THIS BOY, REGARDLESS OF HOW LATE
###765 WE WERE UP, WOULD BE AT THAT
###768 FIELD READY TO GO AT 9 O'CLOCK.
###770 MY TIME WITH JETER THOUGH, KEPT
###773 ME IN THE LEAGUE FOR SIX YEARS
###774 INSTEAD OF BEING CUT AFTER TWO.
###775 BLOSSETT: KEAGLE AND LONG NOT
###776 ONLY SHARE SIMILAR EXPERIENCES,
###778 BUT NOW SHARE SIMILAR
###779 PHILOSOPHIES, AS RIT ASSISTANT
###781 COACHES. KEAGLE: WE COACH VERY
###783 SIMILAR HERE AT SCHOOL: I'M NOT
###786 A BABYSITTER. WE ARE HERE AS
###788 SUPPORT AND I CAN'T WANT IT
###790 WORSE THAN MY PLAYERS WANT IT,
###791 AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE'S
###793 TALKING ABOUT WITH DEREK. NOBODY
###794 WAS THERE TO TELL DEREK! HERE'S
###796 A GUY ON REHAB AND AT THAT
###798 POINT, LET'S FACE IT: BASEBALL,
###800 ONE THING YOU KNOW IS WHEN
###801 YOU'RE HURT, YOU GET FORGOTTEN
###803 VERY EASILY. SO IT'S UP TO YOU
###805 TO PULL YOURSELF UP BY THE
###806 BOOTSTRAPS AND GO OUT AND DO
###808 YOUR WORK. WE USE THIS ALL THE
###809 TIME, THIS ANALOGY: IT'S NOT AN
###811 ACCIDENT. YOU PUT YOURSELF IN A
###813 POSITION TO HAVE SUCCESS,
###815 SUCCESS WILL COME. DON'T EXPECT
###817 IT TO JUST COME BECAUSE YOU'RE
###819 TALENTED, FIRST ROUND PICK, THIS
###821 THAT OR THE NEXT THING, BECAUSE
###822 THERE'S BEEN SOMEBODY ALONG THE
###823 WAY WHO CAME ALONG WHO WAS JUST
###825 AS TALENTED, JUST AS RICH, JUST
###827 AS CONNECTED AS YOU WERE. GROW:
###828 THEY'RE ON THE SAME PAGE BECAUSE
###830 THEY HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCES.
###831 THEY WENT THROUGH PRO BASEBALL,
###832 SO NOW IT'S JUST PUTTING THAT
###834 INTO A COLLEGE SYSTEM AND MAKING
###836 SURE THAT THESE GUYS, ON A DAILY
###838 BASIS, GET THAT WORK DONE AND
###840 REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES.
###842 SO THEY BOTH CONTRIBUTE AN AWFUL
###844 LOT. I COULDN'T IMAGINE ON A
###846 DAILY BASIS IF THEY WEREN'T HERE
###848 HOW MUCH DIFFERENT IT WOULD BE.
###850 OUR PLAYERS ARE FORTUNATE THAT
###852 THEY HAVE SPECIAL GUYS INVOLVED
###854 IN THE PROGRAM. NEW SPEAKER:
###866 STAY ON THE ROAD. TROMBLEY TIRE
###871 AND AUTO. DITULLIO: OVER THE
###874 SUMMER, THREE RIT STUDENTS
###875 EXPERIENCED THE JOURNEY OF A
###877 LIFETIME, AS KRISTIN KLOCK
###878 DISCOVERED, IT WAS A RIDE WITH A
###879 PURPOSE FOR THESE PI KAPPA PHI
###890 BROTHERS THAT SPANNED NEARLY
###891 4,000 MILES OVER 67 DAYS. KLOCK:
###892 THE ONLY DISABILITY IN LIFE IS A
###894 BAD ATTITUDE. THIS WAS THE DAILY
###895 MANTRA FOR TJ RODGERS, VICTOR
###898 SANTIAGO AND ALEX DUNNER AS THEY
###899 TRAVELED CROSS COUNTRY ON A
###903 JOURNEY OF HOPE. NEW SPEAKER:
###905 THIS ALL STARTED BACK IN 1978
###906 WITH BRUCE RODGERS. HE WAS A
###908 MEMBER OF OUR FRATERNITY, PI
###909 KAPPA PHI, HE WAS DOING A CROSS
###910 COUNTRY BIKE TRIP AND DECIDED
###913 THAT HE WOULD DO IT IN THE NAME
###915 OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.
###916 EVER SINCE THEN, IT'S BECOME SO
###917 MUCH BIGGER AND IT'S GROWN
###919 EXPONENTIALLY EVERY YEAR. THIS
###922 PAST YEAR WE HAD RIGHT AROUND
###924 130 PEOPLE AND IT'S BRANCHED OUT
###925 FROM HIS ONE ORIGINAL ROUTE TO
###927 THREE SEPARATE ROUTES. KLOCK:
###929 WHAT ARE THE THREE SEPARATE
###930 ROUTES? NEW SPEAKER: THE THREE
###931 SEPARATE ROUTES ARE THE NORTH,
###932 THE SOUTH AND THE TRANSAMERICA.
###934 THE TRANSAMERICA ROUTE STARTS IN
###936 SEATTLE AND GOES TO WASHINGTON,
###937 D.C. AND THE NORTH AND SOUTH
###940 START IN SAN FRANCISCO AND GO TO
###941 WASHINGTON, D. C. AS WELL. PI
###943 KAPPA PHI IS ACTUALLY THE ONLY
###945 FRATERNITY TO OWN AND OPERATE
###947 ITS OWN PHILANTHROPY, SO PUSH
###948 AMERICA WAS STARTED BY PI KAPPA
###950 PHI AND YOU KNOW, WE JUST SEEK
###954 TO RAISE FUNDS AND AWARENESS FOR
###955 PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THE
###956 MISSION STATEMENT OF PUSH
###958 AMERICA IS TO BUILD LEADERS OF
###960 TOMORROW BY ASSISTING PEOPLE
###962 WITH DISABILITIES TODAY. KLOCK:
###963 THE THREE TIGERS WERE ALL CREW
###965 MEMBERS WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR
###968 THE SAFETY OF THE CYCLISTS. WHAT
###969 GOES INTO MAKING SURE THEY GET
###971 FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO WASHINGTON
###972 SAFELY? NEW SPEAKER: THERE'S A
###974 LOT OF LOGISTICS AND A LOT OF
###976 PLANNING THAT GOES BEHIND IT. US
###979 CREW GUYS, WE GET DIRECTIONS FOR
###982 EVERY SINGLE DAY OF THE TRIP SO
###984 OUR BINDERS ARE ABOUT LIKE THIS
###987 THICK. AND AGAIN, THE NIGHT
###988 BEFORE WE SCOUT, MAKE SURE THAT
###990 THE ROADS ARE FINE, AND IF WE
###992 NEED TO DO A DETOUR WE'LL HAVE
###994 TO RIDE IT OUT AND WE'LL HAVE TO
###996 FIND A DETOUR ON OUR OWN. KLOCK:
###998 AS THE LONG AND TIRING JOURNEY
###1000 CAME TO A CLOSE, THE TIGERS
###1001 BEGAN TO REALIZE JUST HOW LIFE
###1003 CHANGING THEIR EXPERIENCE WAS.
###1006 WHAT WAS IT LIKE ARRIVING IN
###1007 D.C. AND FINALLY FINISHING THE
###1010 67 DAY JOURNEY? NEW SPEAKER:
###1011 HEARING ABOUT IT FROM THE
###1013 BROTHERS WHO HAD DONE IT BEFORE
###1014 AND ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING IT,
###1015 IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT. THAT DAY
###1019 COMES AND YOU HAVE ALL THREE
###1022 ROUTES GETTING TOGETHER, ALL THE
###1023 CYCLISTS ARE IN THE ROAD, AND
###1026 JUST DRIVING THROUGH THE CITY,
###1027 PEOPLE ARE JUST LIKE HONKING AND
###1029 YELLING, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE
###1030 DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BUT
###1031 THEY SEE THAT THE COPS ARE
###1033 LEADING US, SO IT'S GOT TO BE
###1034 IMPORTANT, AND ONCE YOU GET
###1036 CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE CAPITOL
###1038 BUILDING, PEOPLE JUST MULTIPLY.
###1040 THERE ARE PEOPLE HOLDING SIGNS
###1042 SAYING, WE LOVE YOU! OR, WE
###1045 MISSED YOU! GLAD YOU'RE BACK!
###1047 AND THERE'S PEOPLE JUST
###1048 CHEERING. THEY WERE THERE
###1049 BECAUSE YOU ALL WENT THROUGH THE
###1051 TRIP TOGETHER AND AS SOON AS WE
###1055 GOT OUT OF THAT AND STARTED
###1056 WALKING THROUGH THE CROWD OF
###1058 PEOPLE, AND JUST HAVING MOMS AND
###1059 DADS COME UP TO ME AND SAYING,
###1062 THANK YOU FOR GETTING MY SON
###1065 HOME; THANK YOU FOR HELPING HIM
###1066 GET HERE SAFELY. IT'S JUST LIKE
###1069 WOW! IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS
###1075 THAT IT JUST HITS YOU HARD, AND
###1083 YOU NEVER FORGET IT. HILL: ZETA
###1084 TAU ALPA AND PHI KAPPA PSI
###1085 ORGANIZED THE 16TH ANNUAL MUD
###1086 TUG. 155 TEAMS PARTICIPATED IN
###1089 THE EVENT, HELPING TO RAISE OVER
###1092 $10,000 FOR THE HILLSIDE FAMILY
###1098 OF AGENCIES. SO HOW ARE YOU
###1100 PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN MUD TUG?
###1101 NEW SPEAKER: I'M THE CO CHAIR
###1103 FOR ZETA TAU ALPHA, WHO IS ONE
###1104 OF THE CO HOSTS OF MUD TUG, THE
###1106 OTHER ONE BEING PHI KAPPA PSI.
###1108 NEW SPEAKER: WE ORGANIZED THE
###1109 WHOLE ENTIRE EVENT, GOT
###1110 EVERYBODY INVOLVED, ALL THE
###1112 SPONSORS AND EVERYTHING, SO
###1113 WE'RE PRETTY MUCH RUNNING THE
###1114 ENTIRE THING WITH OUR FRATERNITY
###1115 AND SORORITY. NEW SPEAKER: AND
###1118 HOW MUCH PLANNING GOES INTO THIS
###1120 EVENT? NEW SPEAKER: WE STARTED
###1121 PLANNING LAST SPRING, SO SPRING,
###1122 SUMMER AND THEN UP UNTIL NOW. I
###1124 HEAR FRESHMEN WHEN THEY COME IN
###1125 FOR THEIR FIRST DAY FOR
###1127 ORIENTATION SAYING, "I CAN'T
###1128 WAIT TO GO TO MUD TUG!" I HEAR
###1129 PEOPLE WALKING ON THE QUARTER
###1131 MILE SAYING, "I CAN'T WAIT FOR
###1132 MUD TUG!" IT'S GREAT. EVERYONE
###1133 LOOKS FORWARD TO IT. NEW
###1134 SPEAKER: AND WHAT EXACTLY IS MUD
###1135 TUG? NEW SPEAKER: IT'S A TEN ON
###1136 TEN TUG OF WAR COMPETITION OVER
###1137 A HUGE MUD PIT NEAR THE PLAY PIT
