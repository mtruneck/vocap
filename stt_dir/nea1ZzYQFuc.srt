UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now, here is Carl to present
us with CNN STUDENT NEWS.

0:0:13,169 --> 0:0:14,139
(END VIDEO CLIP)

0:0:14,139 --> 0:0:18,24
CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Nice. We appreciate
the intro and the pun from Mrs. Lauther`s


5
0:0:18,24 --> 0:0:23,3
(ph) class. I am Carl Azuz, presenting your
commercial free news on this Monday, January


6
0:0:23,3 --> 0:0:38,0
7th.


7
0:0:38,0 --> 0:0:42,519
First up today, some help is on the way for
victims of what came to be known as super


8
0:0:42,519 --> 0:0:47,769
storm Sandy. The critics say that help is
not enough. On Friday, one day after getting


9
0:0:47,769 --> 0:0:53,909
to work, the 113th U.S. Congress passed a
bill worth $9 billion. The money from the


10
0:0:53,909 --> 0:0:59,629
federal government will be put in an insurance
program that will help cover costs for this,


11
0:0:59,629 --> 0:1:5,909
this incredible damage we keep seeing from
the October storm that was 1,000 miles wide.


12
0:1:5,909 --> 0:1:11,9
The money won`t do much to help businesses,
though. More than 200,000 had some kind of


13
0:1:11,9 --> 0:1:16,46
damage, or were otherwise impacted by Sandy.
And that`s why some of them and many lawmakers


14
0:1:16,46 --> 0:1:21,439
are calling for more government aid. Congress
is scheduled to take up another bill worth


15
0:1:21,439 --> 0:1:27,38
$51 billion in business relief, but not until
January 15.


16
0:1:27,38 --> 0:1:32,299
Another issue Congress is looking at - guns.
The goal is to find a way to prevent more


17
0:1:32,299 --> 0:1:37,929
tragic shootings in the U.S. But there are
a lot of ideas about how to do that, so many


18
0:1:37,929 --> 0:1:43,38
that in the U.S. House of Representatives
alone, almost 12 bills were introduced last


19
0:1:43,38 --> 0:1:49,289
week that had something to do with gun violence.
So is the answer more restrictions on guns


20
0:1:49,289 --> 0:1:54,63
or the people who can buy them, or more guns
in more places? Congress, surprise, surprise,


21
0:1:54,63 --> 0:1:59,53
will have to find some middle ground on this
to get something through both Houses and signed


22
0:1:59,53 --> 0:2:0,409
by the president.


23
0:2:0,409 --> 0:2:1,1
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


24
0:2:1,1 --> 0:2:5,84
ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: As students
in Sandy Hook elementary returned to class,


25
0:2:5,84 --> 0:2:11,78
former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, nearly
killed in a mass shooting two years ago, visited


26
0:2:11,78 --> 0:2:17,42
Newtown, Connecticut. And on Capitol Hill,
lawmakers arrived to begin a new session of


27
0:2:17,42 --> 0:2:21,13
Congress, with members in both chambers taking
aim at guns.


28
0:2:21,13 --> 0:2:24,63
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, D-CALIFORNIA: This
is a fight that the American people are going


29
0:2:24,63 --> 0:2:27,6
to have to stand up and stiffen their spine.


30
0:2:27,6 --> 0:2:31,94
JONES: California Democratic Senator Dianne
Feinstein plans to introduce a bill to ban


31
0:2:31,94 --> 0:2:37,47
more 100 assault weapons, 8 years after the
old ban she championed expired.


32
0:2:37,47 --> 0:2:42,48
Another Senate bill would ban high-capacity
magazines, and among nearly a dozen gun bills


33
0:2:42,48 --> 0:2:47,78
introduced on day one in the House are efforts
to ban online sales of ammunition, and to


34
0:2:47,78 --> 0:2:53,43
require background checks for all firearm
sales, including at gun shows. Two bills from


35
0:2:53,43 --> 0:2:58,76
freshmen Republican congressmen would allow
more guns around schools, echoing the position


36
0:2:58,76 --> 0:3:0,5
of the National Rifle Association.


37
0:3:0,5 --> 0:3:7,88
WAYNE LAPIERRE, CEO, NRA: The only thing that
stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with


38
0:3:7,88 --> 0:3:8,2
a gun.


39
0:3:8,2 --> 0:3:12,71
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are better than 32
more gun murders every day.


40
0:3:12,71 --> 0:3:17,45
JONES: Pro gun control groups plan to keep
pressing for action, but what are the prospects


41
0:3:17,45 --> 0:3:18,8
for their success?


42
0:3:18,8 --> 0:3:22,19
JOHN GRAMLICH, CQ ROLL CALL: If you`re talking
about stuff around the edges, like maybe banning


43
0:3:22,19 --> 0:3:27,9
high-capacity ammunition magazines, that might
be possible. The NRA is the big issue, but


44
0:3:27,9 --> 0:3:32,66
I wouldn`t say it`s necessarily on the Republican
side only, it`s on the Democratic side also.


45
0:3:32,66 --> 0:3:37,98
You have fully half of your new Senate has
an either A+, A, or an A- rating from the


46
0:3:37,98 --> 0:3:40,48
NRA. So if you want anything to happen on
gun control, you`re going to have to have


47
0:3:40,48 --> 0:3:45,79
at least half the Senate upsetting the NRA,
and so that`s a very difficult proposition.


48
0:3:45,79 --> 0:3:52,8
FEINSTEIN: There is no more uphill fight than
this. The question is do we fight or do we


49
0:3:52,8 --> 0:3:53,75
knuckle under?


50
0:3:53,75 --> 0:3:58,92
JONES: President Obama says he wants action
on gun legislation this year. He`s asked Vice


51
0:3:58,92 --> 0:4:3,43
President Biden to lead a task force to come
up with recommendations on gun policy. They


52
0:4:3,43 --> 0:4:5,99
are expected this month.


53
0:4:5,99 --> 0:4:8,49
Athena Jones, CNN, Washington.


54
0:4:8,49 --> 0:4:9,91
(END VIDEOTAPE)


55
0:4:9,91 --> 0:4:17,32
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can ID me.
I`m a U.S. Government agency. I`m part of


56
0:4:17,32 --> 0:4:22,39
the Department of Health and Human Services.
I`m responsible for protecting the health


57
0:4:22,39 --> 0:4:28,62
of people and animals, and I oversee everything
from medicines to food to cosmetics.


58
0:4:28,62 --> 0:4:36,289
I`m the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.


59
0:4:36,289 --> 0:4:43,6
AZUZ: Chances are you`ve gotten food poisoning
at some point. The Centers for Disease Control


60
0:4:43,6 --> 0:4:48,449
and Prevention estimates that each year, one
of every six Americans gets sick from something


61
0:4:48,449 --> 0:4:53,8
they eat. Part of the Food and Drug Administration`s
job is to try to cut down on that as much


62
0:4:53,8 --> 0:4:58,61
as possible, so it proposed two new rules
Friday that it says could prevent more than


63
0:4:58,61 --> 0:5:4,69
a million foodborne illnesses each year. One
would be new safety standards for farmers


64
0:5:4,69 --> 0:5:7,8
and the fruits and vegetable they grow. For
example, they`d have to make sure their water


65
0:5:7,8 --> 0:5:11,8
is clean and that animals are kept out of
their fields.


66
0:5:11,8 --> 0:5:16,21
The other rule would require companies to
have a plan in place to make sure their foods


67
0:5:16,21 --> 0:5:21,36
don`t make people sick, and for dealing with
outbreaks if they do happen. There is a downside


68
0:5:21,36 --> 0:5:27,56
here, costs for farmers and businesses could
go up, and that could mean higher food prices.


69
0:5:27,56 --> 0:5:34,509
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s Shoutout goes
to Mr. Lund`s classes at Wallace Junior Senior


70
0:5:34,509 --> 0:5:37,31
High School in Wallace, Idaho.


71
0:5:37,31 --> 0:5:42,24
Which of these countries has the lowest literacy
rate among women? If you think you know it,


72
0:5:42,24 --> 0:5:52,77
then shout it out. Is it Pakistan, Kenya,
Jamaica or Saudi Arabia? You`ve got 3 seconds,


73
0:5:52,77 --> 0:5:53,949
go.


74
0:5:53,949 --> 0:6:1,919
In Pakistan, an estimated 40 percent of women
know how to read and write, by far the lowest


75
0:6:1,919 --> 0:6:8,569
percentage of those countries. That`s your
answer and that`s your shoutout.


76
0:6:8,569 --> 0:6:13,919
AZUZ: Malala Yousafzai is a 15-year-old who
wants to change that. You heard us talk about


77
0:6:13,919 --> 0:6:20,15
her last year when she was attacked for promoting
girls education rights in Pakistan. On Friday,


78
0:6:20,15 --> 0:6:25,39
Malala went home, a temporary home in the
United Kingdom, where she`s been in the hospital.


79
0:6:25,39 --> 0:6:29,43
She has her family there with her, and doctors
say she`s doing better, though after wounds


80
0:6:29,43 --> 0:6:33,999
to her head and neck, she has a long road
ahead, and more surgery scheduled within the


81
0:6:33,999 --> 0:6:39,129
next month. Malala`s work and survival have
already gotten international attention centered


82
0:6:39,129 --> 0:6:43,61
on women`s education rights in Pakistan. The
country`s government says it will protect


83
0:6:43,61 --> 0:6:46,919
her if she decides to go back.


84
0:6:46,919 --> 0:6:51,84
Until a few years ago, you wouldn`t have found
a woman serving aboard a U.S. Navy submarine.


85
0:6:51,84 --> 0:6:56,749
It just wasn`t allowed. The rule changed in
2009 and some of the first women who were


86
0:6:56,749 --> 0:7:1,599
chosen to do it said it wasn`t tougher because
they were women; it was tougher because of


87
0:7:1,599 --> 0:7:5,449
the training. We`re going to dive a little
deeper on what it`s like to serve the country


88
0:7:5,449 --> 0:7:5,87
underwater.


89
0:7:5,87 --> 0:7:6,699
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


90
0:7:6,699 --> 0:7:14,189
CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It`s a
new frontier for female sailors. Submerged


91
0:7:14,189 --> 0:7:17,12
for months, no sun, no space, no sleep.


92
0:7:17,12 --> 0:7:20,379
LT. JG MARQUETTE LEVEQUE, U.S. NAVY: (inaudible)
dive.


93
0:7:20,379 --> 0:7:24,639
LAWRENCE: Lieutenant Junior Grade Marquette
Leveque is one of the first women to qualify


94
0:7:24,639 --> 0:7:25,889
for submarine duty.


95
0:7:25,889 --> 0:7:27,529
(on camera): Was it everything you expected?


96
0:7:27,529 --> 0:7:30,219
LEVEQUE: I got a lot less sleep than I imagined
I would.


97
0:7:30,219 --> 0:7:34,68
LAWRENCE (voice over): We met Leveque a few
years ago when she went by her maiden name,


98
0:7:34,68 --> 0:7:35,8
Reid.


99
0:7:35,8 --> 0:7:37,43
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Marquette Jay Reid (ph)


100
0:7:37,43 --> 0:7:42,139
LAWRENCE: She was a cadet at the naval academy
when the Pentagon opened sub duty to women.


101
0:7:42,139 --> 0:7:47,65
LEVEQUE: At the time, I was flying. I was
a pilot. Selected to be a pilot after graduation.


102
0:7:47,65 --> 0:7:53,509
LAWRENCE: Leveque decided her future was under
the water, not soaring above it. And she wasn`t


103
0:7:53,509 --> 0:7:54,719
afraid of breaking a barrier.


104
0:7:54,719 --> 0:7:58,599
LEVEQUE: I see us being just like our male
counterparts, and I think that we`ll be accepted


105
0:7:58,599 --> 0:7:59,89
the same way.


106
0:7:59,89 --> 0:8:0,479
LAWRENCE: Leveque earned her dolphin.


107
0:8:0,479 --> 0:8:2,469
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations, great
job.


108
0:8:2,469 --> 0:8:6,93
LAWRENCE: A gold chest device that means she`s
mastered submarine operations.


109
0:8:6,93 --> 0:8:8,689
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sign the book.


110
0:8:8,689 --> 0:8:8,909
LEVEQUE: Yes, sir.


111
0:8:8,909 --> 0:8:10,409
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s been a long time coming,
right?


112
0:8:10,409 --> 0:8:10,969
LEVEQUE: Yes.


113
0:8:10,969 --> 0:8:15,9
LAWRENCE: It took a year of nuclear training,
three more months at submarine officer school.


114
0:8:15,9 --> 0:8:17,96
LEVEQUE: Dive (inaudible) two five zero feet.


115
0:8:17,96 --> 0:8:20,59
LAWRENCE: And then her first sea tour.


116
0:8:20,59 --> 0:8:25,96
LEVEQUE: It`s a huge honor to finally really
feel like I`m a part of the submarine community.


117
0:8:25,96 --> 0:8:31,5
LAWRENCE: In fact, Leveque is one of only
three women to qualify as unrestricted line


118
0:8:31,5 --> 0:8:36,919
officers. That`s big, because it means down
the road she would be eligible to one day


119
0:8:36,919 --> 0:8:43,259
assume command of a nuclear powered sub. And
it`s pretty clear that whenever war is waged


120
0:8:43,259 --> 0:8:47,5
under water, women are going to be a part
of that fight.


121
0:8:47,5 --> 0:8:49,61
Chris Lawrence, CNN, the Pentagon.

123
0:8:50,589 --> 0:8:54,82
AZUZ: You folks in band might like this. Before
we go, if your washing machine is rocking,


124
0:8:54,82 --> 0:9:3,3
it`s usually a sign that the clothes in it
are unbalanced. This one just rocks.


125
0:9:3,3 --> 0:9:7,529
(MUSIC)


126
0:9:7,529 --> 0:9:15,49
AZUZ: What do you say about this? He`s 10
years old, has a great sense of rhythm, and


127
0:9:15,49 --> 0:9:21,72
totally rocked YouTube by making his washing
machine his drum kit. No hum-drum performance


128
0:9:21,72 --> 0:9:25,37
there. I played drums in middle and high school.
He would have totally taken me to the cleaners.


129
0:9:25,37 --> 0:9:29,61
It`s not that I washed out, it would just
be hard to keep up rhythm. CNN STUDENT NEWS


130
0:9:29,61 --> 0:11:29,61
will tap back into the news cycle tomorrow.
Hope to see you then.
