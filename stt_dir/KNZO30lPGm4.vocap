###19 ROCCO CASTORO: In Florida, I can sell you a gun on the
###21 street, and it's completely legal.
###23 How are you going to keep track of all these guns that
###25 people are just selling and trading between themselves?
###27 [GUN SHOT]
###30 ROCCO CASTORO: Welcome to Sarasota, Florida, home to
###33 Siesta Key, the number one beach in the
###35 United States of America.
###36 It's also home to more guns than you can possibly imagine.
###39 And we're going to go shoot them, talk about their laws,
###43 and get ready to blow the shit out of everything.
###46 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###62 ROCCO CASTORO: Every year, there are over 30,000 gun
###64 deaths in the United States, a country with 5% of the world's
###69 population and 50% of its guns.
###71 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###82 ROCCO CASTORO: The almost unfathomable national tragedy
###85 that happened on December 14 was the latest and most
###87 horrific example in a string of mass shootings that have
###90 occurred in the United States over the past 30 years.
###93 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###99 ROCCO CASTORO: And this time, there will almost certainly be
###101 a massive legislative shift on the national level.
###104 How wide-sweeping it will be remains to be seen.
###107 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###116 ROCCO CASTORO: I was born and raised in Florida.
###118 And based on my years of experience trolling around
###120 with some of its most interesting, valiant and
###122 despicable residents, I can assure you that many wholly
###125 sensible and productive Floridians of
###127 all stripes own guns.
###129 And yeah, a lot of scumbags have them too.
###133 One of the good guys is Philadelphia native, Eddie
###135 Cacciola, a 32-year-old former Marine.
###138 Eddie moved to Florida five years ago.
###139 Before that, he served as a combat engineer during the
###142 first wave of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
###144 EDDIE CACCIOLA: It was pretty scary.
###147 They were shooting Scud missiles over our heads, just
###150 lobbing them in our direction.
###152 They were blowing up before.
###153 They probably blew up more of themselves than us.
###156 
###159 ROCCO CASTORO: Following President Obama's 2008 defeat
###162 of Republican nominee, John McCain, many firearms dealers
###165 in Florida and throughout the nation reported a massive
###167 uptick in background checks for concealed carry permits, a
###170 clear indicator that gun sales were spiking nationally.
###174 The stockpiling also resulted in an ammo shortage.
###176 By February, 2009, the Orlando Sentinel reported that 9mm,
###180 .45 caliber, .38 caliber, and .22 caliber bullets were
###183 becoming scarce.
###184 They also reported that local Walmarts in Apopka and
###187 Kissimmee had confirmed that these types of ammo were on
###190 back order.
###191 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###193 ROCCO CASTORO: We're outside Survive Anything.
###196 Inside, you will find everything you need to survive
###199 earthquakes, which, as far as I know, have never happened in
###202 Florida, zombies, which again, as far as I know, have never
###205 happened in reality, and an assortment of other
###208 apocalyptic scenarios that you need to prepare for.
###211 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###216 EDDIE CACCIOLA: People were more
###217 concerned about the elections.
###218 People were very concerned about what Obama's going to
###220 do, what Romney was going to do, what they
###222 had done in the past.
###223 ROCCO CASTORO: A 2009 Gallup poll reported that as many as
###226 41% of Americans believe that Obama would, quote, "attempt
###230 to ban the sale of guns in the United States while he's
###233 president," as in all guns.

###246 [END VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###246 EDDIE CACCIOLA: The day after, I went out just to see the
###248 availability of stuff.
###250 There was people in and out of there with bags of anything
###252 they could grab.
###253 And then I stopped at a local gun shop, The Bullet Hole.
###256 And about every fifth person that walked in there was
###259 talking about how they're coming to
###260 take all of our guns.
###261 MICHAEL CREA: I just think it's a big election scare.
###263 And it happens every four years.
###265 And people get worried about what could happen.
###267 ROCCO CASTORO: Takes a lot.
###268 MICHAEL CREA: No problem.
###268 ROCCO CASTORO: Have a good day.
###269 MICHAEL CREA: You too.
###270 
###275 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###284 ROCCO CASTORO: OK, I think we should
###285 probably get out of here.
###286 [VOICE ON WALKIE TALKIE]
###289 ROCCO CASTORO: Apparently, Walmart gets freaked out when
###291 you try to buy over 2,000 rounds of ammo at one time.
###295 So we went with the next best and more expensive option,
###298 visiting one Sarasota's many gun stores.
###301 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###316 JOHN BUCHAN: It started between a partnership.
###318 We actually put a patent on a 100-round drum magazine to fit
###320 a Glock pistol.
###321 And we were marketing gun shows.
###323 These used to only fit dual-feed AR-15s, AK-47s.
###328 We converted it so it will fit a Glock, changed some inside
###331 parts, different housing.
###332 The first part you're going to see, it's in a chassis system
###334 called a RONI.
###335 ROCCO CASTORO: Well, that's impressive.
###338 JOHN BUCHAN: You'll see a second fire sequence.
###341 And that's just in the Glock pistol alone.
###343 Naturally, those are not available to civilians.
###344 ROCCO CASTORO: I would imagine.
###345 JOHN BUCHAN: I don't sell them.
###347 Can't sell them and won't do anything with them.
###349 ROCCO CASTORO: But you have the patent.
###350 JOHN BUCHAN: On the drum.
###351 ROCCO CASTORO: On the drum.
###352 JOHN BUCHAN: On the drum.
###353 ROCCO CASTORO: Have people been buying more ammo or more
###355 guns than normal?
###357 JOHN BUCHAN: Oh, there's an increase in sales in both.
###358 ROCCO CASTORO: Yeah.
###358 Yep.
###359 And why do you think that is?
###360 JOHN BUCHAN: Personal protection, fear of, maybe, I
###363 don't know, government regulation, banning weapons,
###365 banning certain types of weapons, banning
###366 ammunition, taxing it.
###368 People are stockpiling it.
###369 People are buying it.
###370 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###374 ROCCO CASTORO: Why would someone buy that weapon?
###376 JOHN BUCHAN: Long distance shooting, competition.
###378 It's just fun to shoot.
###379 ROCCO CASTORO: How far will that go?
###380 JOHN BUCHAN: At a mile and a half, a .50 round has got more
###383 punch than a .44 Mag does six inches from your chest.
###386 ROCCO CASTORO: At a mile and a half.
###387 JOHN BUCHAN: In a mile and a half.
###388 ROCCO CASTORO: Well, thanks so much, John.
###390 JOHN BUCHAN: Yeah.
###390 No problem.
###392 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###395 ROCCO CASTORO: So two Walmarts, one gun store later,
###400 we got all of our needs for today.
###402 Walmart was pretty accommodating.
###403 But every time you go, it's a kind of a crap shoot, right?
###406 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Yeah.
###407 Sometimes they'll have everything you need.
###409 And that's when you've got to buy it up.
###410 Other times, you've got to buy something you don't want.
###414 ROCCO CASTORO: I'm going to go through a little bit of what
###415 we got here, Federal [INAUDIBLE]
###417 for a 9mm Luger.
###418 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Then we got a couple of boxes of .45
###423 Federal, some .410 shotgun shells.
###427 A big box of .45 auto, 250-round count.
###430 ROCCO CASTORO: Rifle slugs for the shotguns, Magtech, Cowboy
###434 Action Loads.
###434 EDDIE CACCIOLA: And 1,000 rounds of .223.
###437 This for the AR?
###438 ROCCO CASTORO: How many people are we shooting with?
###441 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Four and then some.
###443 ROCCO CASTORO: Beautiful fall Florida day, hot as shit.
###447 
###450 The Federal Assault Weapons Ban was passed under the
###452 Clinton administration in September, 1994.
###455 Sunset provisions set the ban to expire in 2004, and it did.
###459 [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###459 -From my cold, dead hands.
###462 [CHEERS]
###466 [END VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###467 ROCCO CASTORO: Since then, lawmakers like Senator Dianne
###470 Feinstein of California and Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy
###473 of New York have attempted to institute revised
###475 versions of the ban.
###478 Did you do anything for Veterans Day?
###482 EDDIE CACCIOLA: No.
###482 I tried not to do too much.
###484 ROCCO CASTORO: Tried to relax?
###485 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Yeah.
###486 I figure it's my day.
###486 I don't have to do shit.
###488 ROCCO CASTORO: Yep.
###489 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###490 ROCCO CASTORO: So with several thousand rounds of ammunition
###492 loaded into Eddie's truck, we headed to a local range on the
###495 outskirts of Sarasota.
###499 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Yeah.
###500 It's convenient.
###501 I like shooting outdoor.
###503 I don't really feel comfortable in indoor ranges.
###505 ROCCO CASTORO:
###508 EDDIE CACCIOLA: It's that, and there's a lot of new people.
###511 And there's just a lot of safety that goes into it that
###514 people just have no clue.
###517 You don't want to be in close quarters with somebody that
###519 doesn't know what they're doing.
###521 ROCCO CASTORO:
###523 EDDIE CACCIOLA: No.
###525 Deer doesn't taste that good.
###526 And it's kind of boring hunting something that's not
###529 going to shoot back at you.
###531 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###557 EDDIE CACCIOLA:
###559 
###566 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###570 EDDIE CACCIOLA:
###571 
###575 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###579 ROCCO CASTORO: Big Nick, one of the guys we shot with, he
###581 had a pretty nice AR-15.
###582 He bought it at a garage sale.
###584 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###587 ROCCO CASTORO: That's pretty standard
###588 practice here in Florida.
###590 No real paperwork was exchanged, as far as I know.
###592 And he got the gun for cash, brought it home.
###597 It was about half price.
###598 
###600 And we just shot it here all day today.
###602 That's how easy it is to get a gun in Florida.
###604 
###607 What types of weapons are illegal in Florida?
###610 JOHN BUCHAN: We have certain categories that you have to
###612 have certain permits for.
###613 I've got a suppressor on a gun on a wall.
###615 You have to fill out a form.
###616 It goes to ATF.
###617 It's a $200 tax stamp.
###618 They do a background check.
###619 They send you the stamp.
###620 You're allowed to own it.
###622 ROCCO CASTORO: OK.
###622 And what are some of the other classifications?
###624 Like a Class 3 license, what would that mean?
###625 JOHN BUCHAN: Well, fully automatic machine guns, fully
###627 automatic weapons is a whole different license.
###629 Transferring those weapons, there's regulations for all of
###632 that stuff.
###632 And those regulations are pretty stringent.
###634 And they are enforced.
###635 MICHAEL CREA: Everybody in Florida owns an assault rifle.
###637 If you try and send the National Guard in, we
###639 outnumber them.
###640 ROCCO CASTORO: [LAUGHS]
###640 MICHAEL CREA: And the National Guard is not going to come to
###642 our house and take our guns away.
###644 JOHN BUCHAN: I've always wondered why it is so
###645 difficult to get a group of people in Washington to sit
###647 down, maybe hook up with some people from the NRA, and set
###652 up districts and set gun laws that are made by gun owners
###656 and people in the firearms industry.
###658 Those laws would work.

###670 [END VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###671 ROCCO CASTORO: In 2004, the Department of Justice released
###674 an assessment of the decade-long ban that said, if
###676 the ban were to be reinstated at a future date, its effects
###679 on gun violence are likely to be small at best, and perhaps
###682 too small for reliable measurement.
###684 The report also stated that assault weapons were rarely
###687 used in gun crimes even before the ban.
###689 A dissenting study carried out by the Brady Center for Gun
###691 Control alleged that data provided by the ATF showed
###694 that the number of violent crimes in which assault
###696 weapons were used dropped from 4.82% to 1.61% during the ban.
###702 An ATF spokesperson later said that his organization could,
###705 in no way, vouch for the validity of that claim.
###708 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###714 ROCCO CASTORO: John is one of Florida's approximately 7,000
###717 Federal Firearms License holders.
###720 The process for obtaining an FFL and what types of weapons
###722 can be bought and sold by those who are issued them is
###725 largely defined by 1938's Federal Firearms Act and the
###728 gun Control Act of 1968.
###733 The ATF issues and oversees licensing criteria for
###735 dealers, pawnbrokers, and other people who have
###738 legitimate business with guns.
###740 But the agency's oversight largely stops at the
###742 licensee's counter.
###743 JOHN BUCHAN: Well, first things first.
###744 When you open a store up, ATF gives you the first right to
###747 decline a sale to any individual for any reason.
###749 And we practice that here.
###751 We've turned gun sales down because of something that we
###753 just sensed.
###754 The person that acts skittish when he's filling out the
###756 questions and asking you a lot of technical things on it and
###758 checks yes to one of the blocks, not happening here.
###761 And somebody that comes in to try to buy a weapon and you
###763 know the gun's not for them, because the boyfriend's
###764 standing right there.
###766 And he's picked out the gun and he wants this.
###768 But she wants to fill the form out.
###769 Totally illegal.
###770 Not happening here.
###771 The kid that walked in here had his hat turned around
###773 backwards, had all the jewelry on and decided to grab one of
###776 the shotguns and wheel it around on his hip and act
###779 like, say hello to my little friend and I've got to have
###781 one of these, not happening here.
###783 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###785 ROCCO CASTORO: After me and the boys exhausted most of our
###787 ammunition, we packed up the weapons and drove to Sarasota
###789 Trap Skeet & Clays, about a half mile down the road.
###792 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###807 'BIG' NICK COLELLA:
###808 
###814 ROCCO CASTORO: Shortly after arriving at the range, we were
###817 joined by Eddie's 12-year-old son, Shawn.
###819 EDDIE CACCIOLA:
###821 ROCCO CASTORO: He came to spend some quality shooting
###823 time with his dad, an American pastime older than playing
###826 catch in the front yard.
###827 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###845 ROCCO CASTORO: So with this shooting, it's better to keep
###848 both eyes open?
###849 Some people?
###849 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Yeah.
###850 Some people say that, on the skeet and trap, it's better to
###853 keep both eyes open.
###856 You couldn't shoot an AR with both eyes open.
###857 ROCCO CASTORO: Yeah.
###858 Yeah.
###858 Of course.
###859 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###867 EDDIE CACCIOLA:
###868 
###876 He's known about guns and the safety rules, probably, five
###880 years prior to him ever picking one up
###882 and shooting one.
###884 If the guns are there and he's there, the sooner I teach him
###887 about the safety, the better off I'd be.
###890 ROCCO CASTORO: Shawn, as it turned out, was
###892 a crack clay shooter.
###893 SHAWN CACCIOLA: Pull!
###894 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###900 EDDIE CACCIOLA:
###902 ROCCO CASTORO: I shuddered at the thought of how accurate
###905 Shawn might be behind an AR-15, imagining a future with
###909 remote control drone soldiers piloted by preteen
###912 sharpshooters.
###912 [VOICE OF JOHN WAYNE]
###913 He's a good shot.

###919 ROCCO CASTORO: Pull.
###920 
###922 Smell the gunpowder.
###924 
###928 Nice.
###930 In between stations, I finally got a chance to speak with
###932 Steve, the fifth member of our party and a former Army medic.
###936 Where were you deployed?
###937 STEVE NORTON: Baghdad.
###938 ROCCO CASTORO: Did you treat a lot of gunshot injuries?
###940 STEVE NORTON:
###941 
###947 ROCCO CASTORO: Since you came back from your deployment, did
###950 it change your appreciation for weapons at all?
###952 STEVE NORTON: No, not at all.
###953 I've always loved weapons.
###955 My dad was special forces.
###959 He taught me at a young age about shooting.
###961 And before I could own my own, he gave me a couple of books I
###964 had to read.
###966 ROCCO CASTORO: Are there any aspects of the law that you
###967 think are a bit overreaching or under-reaching?
###972 STEVE NORTON: Probably not too bad.
###973 ROCCO CASTORO: Yeah?
###974 STEVE NORTON: As long as you do the proper paperwork
###976 in the right way.
###977 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###982 ROCCO CASTORO: On January 16, Obama announced 23 executive
###986 orders he could enact without Congressional approval, in an
###989 effort to curb gun violence and reinforce existing
###991 firearms laws.
###993 These actions include signing a Presidential memorandum that
###995 requires Federal agencies to make relevant firearms
###998 purchasing data available to the Federal Background Check
###1000 System, launching a national safe and responsible gun
###1003 ownership campaign, providing schools with resource officers
###1006 and counselors, and instituting more severe
###1008 penalties for gun trafficking.
###1011 [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###1012 -As soon as I'm finished speaking here, I will sit at
###1015 that desk and I will sign a directive giving law
###1017 enforcement, schools, mental health professionals, and the

###1038 ROCCO CASTORO: High Noon, like many other gun shops in the
###1040 state, offers Concealed Weapon Permit Certification classes.
###1044 They are overseen by Tom Dusseau, a local police
###1046 officer, former Marine, and private military contractor.
###1049 TOM DUSSEAU: Well, essentially, the state of
###1050 Florida requires that you take an NRA approved course.
###1053 But what a lot of the instructors are lacking is
###1056 the, say, for lack of a better term, the real life experience
###1060 when it comes to being involved in a
###1061 confrontational situation.
###1063 You look at the weapons and how other people perceive
###1067 them, and that's what it is, it's perception, when you have
###1070 a list of people, politicians, whatever the case may be,
###1075 picking weapons to put on an assault weapons banned list,
###1079 just because they look evil.
###1081 EDDIE CACCIOLA: You can make anything look badass.
###1083 Some have a wooden stock.
###1084 Some have a composite stock.
###1086 Obviously, the composite stock looks like somebody's coming
###1090 to hurt you.
###1090 And the other one reminds me of my grandfather's rifle.
###1094 TOM DUSSEAU: Does that make it a war-type or assault weapon?
###1097 Not really.
###1098 It's a design.
###1099 After the first election when Obama was elected, I was
###1101 teaching Concealed Weapons classes in
###1103 the state of Florida.
###1104 A big class prior to the election
###1106 was eight to 10 people.
###1108 After the election, every time I'd walk in there, there was
###1112 25 to 30 people.
###1114 The people are running in panic.
###1115 They know the restrictions are coming.
###1117 They come out and they buy a large number of firearms.
###1119 And then they just put them in a safe.
###1120 They don't carry them.
###1121 They don't use them.
###1122 They just buy them.

###1162 ROCCO CASTORO: On a Saturday following the shooting of 28
###1165 people at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut,
###1167 Virginia State Police processed 4,166 background
###1171 checks for concealed and assault-type weapons, a 42%
###1174 increase from the same Saturday in 2011.
###1177 On the same day, Colorado, a state still reeling from a
###1180 string of recent shootings, also processed 4,200
###1184 background checks, the highest number since the
###1186 program began in 1999.
###1188 The fallout resulting from the shooting at Sandy Hook
###1190 Elementary has led to a 19% rise in background checks
###1194 nationwide.
###1195 According to the FBI, approximately 2.78 million
###1198 background checks were recorded in the month of
###1200 December 2012 alone.
###1202 That's a 39% rise from the previous month.
###1207 In recent years, there has been much renewed attention
###1209 paid to some of the more nebulous aspects of many
###1211 states' gun laws.
###1212 Particular attention has been paid to what is called the
###1214 "stand your ground" law, the guiding principle behind
###1217 "stand your ground" being that any person in public, if they
###1219 feel as if their life has been threatened, has the right to
###1222 shoot that threat dead on the spot
###1224 without any duty to retreat.
###1226 "Stand your ground" became a household phrase following an
###1228 incident in Florida in which the threat in question was an
###1231 unarmed, black 17-year-old with nothing in his pockets
###1234 but a bag of Skittles.
###1235 That boy's name was Trayvon Martin.
###1238 There are currently 24 states with "stand your
###1240 ground" laws in effect.
###1242 New research indicates that states with "stand your
###1244 ground" laws have a 7% to 9% higher homicide rate, compared
###1247 to states without such laws.
###1249 Another aspect of firearms laws currently under scrutiny
###1252 in Washington is the ability to purchase certain types of
###1255 weapons at gun shows, pop-up shops, or through private
###1258 sales between citizens.
###1259 [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###1259 --when as many as 40% of all gun purchases are conducted
###1263 without a background check.

###1266 MICHAEL CREA: In Florida, I can sell you
###1268 a gun on the street.
###1269 And it's completely legal.
###1269 JOHN BUCHAN: You run into a lot of that at gun shows,
###1271 outside in the parking lot, the side deal.
###1273 But yes, it is legal to do that.
###1275 MICHAEL CREA: You know, I could have bought a gun from a
###1276 guy who had it for 40 years, sold it to
###1279 10 different people.
###1280 They're not going to trace that back.
###1281 How are you going to keep track of all these guns that
###1282 people are just selling and trading between themselves?
###1284 EDDIE CACCIOLA: One came right here.
###1287 And the other one I met in a gas station parking lot.
###1290 ROCCO CASTORO: Did they just hand it to
###1291 you out in the open?
###1293 EDDIE CACCIOLA: We put it in the back of my pickup truck
###1295 and tactfully looked it over and made sure
###1298 it was what it was.
###1299 And he had a gun and I had cash, so we made a trade.
###1305 So I'm here looking on Florida Gun Trader, see if there's any
###1309 local deals to be had.

###1329 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1331 ROCCO CASTORO: So earlier today, you found this Sig
###1333 Sauer P238 Blackwood with night sites
###1336 on Florida Gun Trader.
###1338 And the guy got in touch with you.
###1339 And we're about to go meet him in a parking lot.
###1342 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Yeah.
###1343 ROCCO CASTORO: And I don't know.
###1344 How shady of a deal, on a scale of 1 to 10,
###1347 would you rate this?
###1348 EDDIE CACCIOLA: 9 and 1/2.
###1349 ROCCO CASTORO: 9 and 1/2?
###1350 [LAUGHS]
###1350 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Yeah.
###1351 Buying a gun at 10 o'clock at night, a little suspect.
###1356 ROCCO CASTORO: Yeah.
###1357 You can't go to restaurants after 10:00.
###1359 Buying a gun, kind of interesting.
###1362 What did the guy say to you on the phone?
###1363 EDDIE CACCIOLA: He wants $550 at the minimum, and as long as
###1368 I'm a Florida resident.
###1369 ROCCO CASTORO: And that just means you've got
###1370 to show him an ID?
###1371 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Yeah.
###1372 ROCCO CASTORO: And he wants cash?
###1373 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Yeah.
###1374 ROCCO CASTORO: OK.
###1375 I'm going to ask you to ask him for a receipt, maybe hint
###1380 at that you may have some priors, but you don't know.
###1384 Are you OK with that?
###1385 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Yeah.
###1385 ROCCO CASTORO: Are you going to be carrying?
###1386 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Probably.
###1387 ROCCO CASTORO: [LAUGHS]
###1388 So let's go do this.
###1390 This is kind of weird.
###1391 [LAUGHS]
###1392 EDDIE CACCIOLA: All right.
###1393 
###1397 ROCCO CASTORO: Within 30 minutes, we were posted up in
###1400 a Lowe's parking lot, waiting for our
###1401 sketchy deal to go down.
###1404 
###1411 EDDIE CACCIOLA:
###1413 EDDIE CACCIOLA:
###1416 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1424 ROCCO CASTORO: How'd it go down?
###1425 You met him, shook hands.
###1428 EDDIE CACCIOLA: We just shot the shit for a minute.
###1429 ROCCO CASTORO: Yeah?
###1430 EDDIE CACCIOLA: And then got down to business, showed me
###1432 what he had.
###1433 ROCCO CASTORO: Did it feel like you were
###1433 making a drug deal?
###1434 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Kind of, actually.
###1435 ROCCO CASTORO: Yeah?
###1436 Yeah?
###1436 [LAUGHS]
###1438 Why don't you show us what you got?
###1439 EDDIE CACCIOLA: A little Sig P238, a little compact carry
###1446 piece, perfect for, maybe, the pocket.
###1451 ROCCO CASTORO: Put it in your belt or something like that.
###1455 It's a nice weight.
###1456 
###1461 EDDIE CACCIOLA: He didn't ask me for anything.
###1463 ROCCO CASTORO: Not even an ID?
###1464 EDDIE CACCIOLA: No.
###1464 ROCCO CASTORO: Didn't even ask for an ID?
###1466 EDDIE CACCIOLA: No.
###1466 ROCCO CASTORO: What kind of guy did he seem like?
###1468 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Ah, a little questionable.
###1470 ROCCO CASTORO: A little quacky?
###1471 Did he think that was weird?
###1473 Did he hesitate at all?
###1474 EDDIE CACCIOLA: He was a little hesitant.
###1475 ROCCO CASTORO: But then he was like, fuck it, I got the cash?
###1477 EDDIE CACCIOLA: Yeah.
###1478 He was like, ah, OK.
###1480 Once he signed his name and I signed my name, he said this
###1484 is a legal binding contract.
###1487 ROCCO CASTORO: Is it notarized?
###1489 [LAUGHS]
###1494 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1498 ROCCO CASTORO: Just like abortion, gay marriage, and
###1500 other hot-button legal issues, it is nearly impossible to
###1503 convince someone that his or her opinion
###1504 about guns is wrong.
###1506 Even if somehow, in some bizarro dimension where
###1509 martial law has been declared, the same people will keep
###1512 stockpiling more and more, until they
###1514 are no longer available.
###1516 Outside of stricter regulations on background
###1518 checks and keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally
###1520 disturbed, there is no easy answer to the firearms debate
###1523 that will make everyone happy.
