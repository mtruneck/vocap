0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:15,744



2
0:0:15,744 --> 0:0:19,57
MIKE RUBENDALL: Keep
these bugs away.


3
0:0:19,57 --> 0:0:23,49
Show them how it pumps.


4
0:0:23,49 --> 0:0:27,22
It's funny, because when I got
into tattooing, it was at a


5
0:0:27,22 --> 0:0:28,49
strange stage in my life.


6
0:0:28,49 --> 0:0:34,42
Because I was 17,
and growing up I


7
0:0:34,42 --> 0:0:36,6
guess made good decisions.


8
0:0:36,6 --> 0:0:39,39
I did well in school and was
heavily into sports, and I


9
0:0:39,39 --> 0:0:41,22
chose a different path,
which was tattooing.


10
0:0:41,22 --> 0:0:44,5
And everybody looked at me like,
you've done so well up


11
0:0:44,5 --> 0:0:45,7
until this point.


12
0:0:45,7 --> 0:0:47,49
And now you're going to hang
out with all these fuck-ups


13
0:0:47,49 --> 0:0:50,65
and devil worshipping, drug
dealing, motorcycle riding


14
0:0:50,65 --> 0:0:54,252
type of guys-- so what are
you doing with your life?


15
0:0:54,252 --> 0:0:57,4
So at the time, nobody thought
it was a really good idea.


16
0:0:57,4 --> 0:1:0,955
Now I'm 33 years old, and they
look at me like maybe it


17
0:1:0,955 --> 0:1:2,205
wasn't such a bad idea.


18
0:1:2,205 --> 0:1:18,198



19
0:1:18,198 --> 0:1:25,0
FRANK ROMANO: There's a group
of people leading the pack.


20
0:1:25,0 --> 0:1:26,21
FRANK ROMANO: Oh, absolutely.


21
0:1:26,21 --> 0:1:29,8
I mean, recently, talking to
one of the guys at the shop


22
0:1:29,8 --> 0:1:31,412
about this, he said,
do you think Mike's


23
0:1:31,412 --> 0:1:33,15
in the top 10 guys?


24
0:1:33,15 --> 0:1:35,29
And I said, yeah.


25
0:1:35,29 --> 0:1:39,6
Name nine guys that are
better than him.


26
0:1:39,6 --> 0:1:42,87
And I'm not looking to hurt
anybody's feelings, but I


27
0:1:42,87 --> 0:1:44,51
think it's closer
to the top five.


28
0:1:44,51 --> 0:1:47,886
And we agreed, yeah, maybe
it's not even the top 10.


29
0:1:47,886 --> 0:1:49,41
Maybe it's the top five.


30
0:1:49,41 --> 0:1:50,36
MIKE RUBENDALL: You
want a pillow?


31
0:1:50,36 --> 0:1:51,34
MALE SPEAKER: Nah.


32
0:1:51,34 --> 0:1:52,95
MIKE RUBENDALL: You got to wait
'til noon 'til the shop


33
0:1:52,95 --> 0:1:53,78
help gets in here though.


34
0:1:53,78 --> 0:1:56,382
MALE SPEAKER: Nah,
that's fine.


35
0:1:56,382 --> 0:1:58,54
MIKE RUBENDALL: I've always
described my tattooing as


36
0:1:58,54 --> 0:2:0,65
Asian influenced.


37
0:2:0,65 --> 0:2:6,6
I think I have a contemporary
approach on traditional


38
0:2:6,6 --> 0:2:9,419
Japanese tattoo style.


39
0:2:9,419 --> 0:2:13,3
Overall look, I want my tattoos
to be timeless.


40
0:2:13,3 --> 0:2:16,475
I want it to be beautiful
as the day I


41
0:2:16,475 --> 0:2:18,7
did it 20 years later.


42
0:2:18,7 --> 0:2:21,21
I don't want somebody to look
at my tattoos and know what


43
0:2:21,21 --> 0:2:22,9
year or whatever I did it in.


44
0:2:22,9 --> 0:2:25,51
MATT BRECKERICH: It's exciting
to look at-- detailed and


45
0:2:25,51 --> 0:2:27,27
simple at the same time.


46
0:2:27,27 --> 0:2:30,202
Exciting, action packed.


47
0:2:30,202 --> 0:2:31,85
That's what I said
the other day.


48
0:2:31,85 --> 0:2:34,88



49
0:2:34,88 --> 0:2:37,43
JUSTIN WEATHERHOLTZ: He has
that extra little bit of


50
0:2:37,43 --> 0:2:40,44
edginess to it that always
kind of grabbed me.


51
0:2:40,44 --> 0:2:43,94
Even the way he does his
compositions and stuff, an


52
0:2:43,94 --> 0:2:45,8
overall look I guess.


53
0:2:45,8 --> 0:2:49,22
CHRIS O'DONNELL: He still does
all kinds of subject matter.


54
0:2:49,22 --> 0:2:53,36
It was pretty much centered
around doing a good quality


55
0:2:53,36 --> 0:2:55,71
job for the person that
comes in the door.


56
0:2:55,71 --> 0:2:58,31
He's not like, I'm going to try
this crazy thing, and if


57
0:2:58,31 --> 0:2:59,58
it doesn't work, it doesn't.


58
0:2:59,58 --> 0:3:2,4
He's like, no, this person wants
this, and this is what


59
0:3:2,4 --> 0:3:2,68
they're going to get.


60
0:3:2,68 --> 0:3:6,17
I'm going to add a lot to that,
but it's going to be in


61
0:3:6,17 --> 0:3:8,8
the nuances, in the progression


62
0:3:8,8 --> 0:3:11,45
of my drawing ability.


63
0:3:11,45 --> 0:3:14,3
And people respond to that.


64
0:3:14,3 --> 0:3:18,18
The whole process is
his personality.


65
0:3:18,18 --> 0:3:22,3
It's very structured
and very right.


66
0:3:22,3 --> 0:3:24,115
He'll show up when he's
supposed to show up.


67
0:3:24,115 --> 0:3:25,78
He'll work really hard.


68
0:3:25,78 --> 0:3:27,69
He'll do the research, he'll
have the drawing, he'll have


69
0:3:27,69 --> 0:3:31,78
it all thought out, takes
it very seriously, and


70
0:3:31,78 --> 0:3:34,271
he'll do a great job.


71
0:3:34,271 --> 0:3:36,46
MIKE RUBENDALL: I'll even chase
my clients, like, can


72
0:3:36,46 --> 0:3:37,82
you come in for a
consultation?


73
0:3:37,82 --> 0:3:39,24
Can we talk about what
you're getting?


74
0:3:39,24 --> 0:3:40,23
I want to be prepared.


75
0:3:40,23 --> 0:3:42,32
I don't want you to show up and
me draw it on the spot.


76
0:3:42,32 --> 0:3:45,13
I don't work well like that.


77
0:3:45,13 --> 0:3:48,2
It's possible I could do a
tattoo like that, but I don't


78
0:3:48,2 --> 0:3:51,4
feel like they're
getting my best.


79
0:3:51,4 --> 0:3:54,41
When the time comes to do the
tattoo, then I try to knock it


80
0:3:54,41 --> 0:3:56,86
out of park.


81
0:3:56,86 --> 0:4:1,11
Even little stuff, they'll come
in, and I said, any of


82
0:4:1,11 --> 0:4:3,31
the guys in the shop are more
than capable of doing this.


83
0:4:3,31 --> 0:4:7,945
You don't need to wait for me,
they'll do an outstanding job.


84
0:4:7,945 --> 0:4:10,87
And they're like, no, we've been
watching you a long time,


85
0:4:10,87 --> 0:4:14,56
and we just want a
piece from you.


86
0:4:14,56 --> 0:4:17,38
I was born and raised in
Massapequa, New York.


87
0:4:17,38 --> 0:4:20,85
It's a small town
on Long Island.


88
0:4:20,85 --> 0:4:22,99
I think I had an average
upbringing.


89
0:4:22,99 --> 0:4:26,25
I came from a middle-class
family.


90
0:4:26,25 --> 0:4:29,2
I think I stayed in Massapequa
because I felt very


91
0:4:29,2 --> 0:4:30,14
comfortable there.


92
0:4:30,14 --> 0:4:33,22
I had this mentality that if you
build it, they will come.


93
0:4:33,22 --> 0:4:37,9
So I felt like why not be in a
place that I grew up in, that


94
0:4:37,9 --> 0:4:40,29
I feel most comfortable in, and
I know the most people?


95
0:4:40,29 --> 0:4:44,69
I felt like I could open up in
my mother's basement and


96
0:4:44,69 --> 0:4:47,2
people would still come and get
tattooed by me-- luckily,


97
0:4:47,2 --> 0:4:48,45
I was fortunate for that.


98
0:4:48,45 --> 0:5:0,936



99
0:5:0,936 --> 0:5:3,6
JOE PAPPALARDO JR.: I think
there was a lot of hesitation


100
0:5:3,6 --> 0:5:5,82
about putting a tattoo shop in
that area because it's so


101
0:5:5,82 --> 0:5:6,31
residential.


102
0:5:6,31 --> 0:5:8,27
I think he had to meet with a
lot of people and show them


103
0:5:8,27 --> 0:5:8,91
his credentials.


104
0:5:8,91 --> 0:5:12,32
And show them he wasn't going
to have people pulling up on


105
0:5:12,32 --> 0:5:13,6
their bikes at all hours
of the night


106
0:5:13,6 --> 0:5:15,13
and doing drugs outside--


107
0:5:15,13 --> 0:5:16,5
that he has a respectable
clientele.


108
0:5:16,5 --> 0:5:18,99
I mean, he's tattooed
celebrities.


109
0:5:18,99 --> 0:5:22,15
His rates are weaning
away people of


110
0:5:22,15 --> 0:5:23,455
that element, I think.


111
0:5:23,455 --> 0:5:27,63



112
0:5:27,63 --> 0:5:31,5
MATT BRECKERICH: Kings Avenue
in Massapequa, it's known as


113
0:5:31,5 --> 0:5:32,74
kind of the classy
tattoo shop.


114
0:5:32,74 --> 0:5:35,85
You know, the shop that we're
hardworking, we have our shit


115
0:5:35,85 --> 0:5:38,98
together, and I would like to
think we're known as the best


116
0:5:38,98 --> 0:5:40,23
of the best around here.


117
0:5:40,23 --> 0:5:43,678



118
0:5:43,678 --> 0:5:48,6
GREZ: Working in Long Island,
it was a shock of how things


119
0:5:48,6 --> 0:5:49,93
were done compared to Boston.


120
0:5:49,93 --> 0:5:52,6
In Long Island, they want
to get tattooed, and


121
0:5:52,6 --> 0:5:53,13
they want it done.


122
0:5:53,13 --> 0:5:56,39
They come in and OK, I'll make
15 appointments to get my


123
0:5:56,39 --> 0:5:58,81
sleeve, I'll do it
every two weeks.


124
0:5:58,81 --> 0:6:0,51
It's a dream.


125
0:6:0,51 --> 0:6:2,72
MALE SPEAKER: The clientele here
is actually pretty open


126
0:6:2,72 --> 0:6:4,2
to bigger work.


127
0:6:4,2 --> 0:6:7,0
You've got big, huge pieces on a
lot of people running around


128
0:6:7,0 --> 0:6:10,346
here, it's pretty crazy.


129
0:6:10,346 --> 0:6:12,92
MIKE RUBENDALL: I remembered I
tattooed a few guys that were


130
0:6:12,92 --> 0:6:15,29
starting big projects
like a sleeve, and


131
0:6:15,29 --> 0:6:16,43
they lost their jobs.


132
0:6:16,43 --> 0:6:20,22
So I would start the
conversation by so, what do


133
0:6:20,22 --> 0:6:20,84
you do for a living?


134
0:6:20,84 --> 0:6:23,58
And the guy would be like,
I just lost my job.


135
0:6:23,58 --> 0:6:25,29
And I'm like, you sure you
want to get into this?


136
0:6:25,29 --> 0:6:29,4
It's a big commitment, a
lot of time and money.


137
0:6:29,4 --> 0:6:31,745
And they're like no,
I need to do this.


138
0:6:31,745 --> 0:6:34,27
They fucking want this,
no matter what.


139
0:6:34,27 --> 0:6:36,53
MATT BRECKERICH: My theory on
that is that a lot of these


140
0:6:36,53 --> 0:6:39,8
people around here, family guys,
they don't go out to the


141
0:6:39,8 --> 0:6:41,6
bar, they got kids.


142
0:6:41,6 --> 0:6:44,99
So it's almost like that's their
way of doing something


143
0:6:44,99 --> 0:6:47,38
cool that makes them feel
alive, I guess.


144
0:6:47,38 --> 0:6:49,63
GREZ: One guy came in once,
and he wanted Mike to do a


145
0:6:49,63 --> 0:6:50,42
sleeve on him.


146
0:6:50,42 --> 0:6:52,88
And he's like, oh, I don't
know, I want some fucking


147
0:6:52,88 --> 0:6:54,87
demon or something.


148
0:6:54,87 --> 0:6:58,4
So he brings in a Lord of the
Rings picture of-- you know


149
0:6:58,4 --> 0:7:1,5
that guy that whips Gandalf,
the guy made of fire and he


150
0:7:1,5 --> 0:7:4,59
pulls him down into the
pit or whatever?


151
0:7:4,59 --> 0:7:8,54
He brings that in and Mike does
a Fudo sleeve on the guy.


152
0:7:8,54 --> 0:7:11,45
The guy, he sees the fire
and he's like fuck yeah.


153
0:7:11,45 --> 0:7:13,24
He was just kind of like joking
around a little bit,


154
0:7:13,24 --> 0:7:16,23
and I looked down at him and I
go, you don't even know what


155
0:7:16,23 --> 0:7:17,915
that is on your arm, do you?


156
0:7:17,915 --> 0:7:19,806
And he goes, psh, yeah I do.


157
0:7:19,806 --> 0:7:21,385
I go, OK, what is that?


158
0:7:21,385 --> 0:7:23,83
He goes, it's fondue.


159
0:7:23,83 --> 0:7:27,39
And Mike and I lost it.


160
0:7:27,39 --> 0:7:32,53
They see your tattoos for what
they in a quality sense.


161
0:7:32,53 --> 0:7:35,54
But a lot of times it's your
job to incorporate more


162
0:7:35,54 --> 0:7:39,4
interesting aspects into the
tattoo that tell a story for


163
0:7:39,4 --> 0:7:40,4
other people that
are viewing it.


164
0:7:40,4 --> 0:7:44,36



165
0:7:44,36 --> 0:7:46,26
JOE PAPPALARDO JR.: People he
knows and that he does a lot


166
0:7:46,26 --> 0:7:47,89
of work on, he pushes it.


167
0:7:47,89 --> 0:7:49,47
Because I think--


168
0:7:49,47 --> 0:7:51,2
I'll use myself as an example.


169
0:7:51,2 --> 0:7:52,606
For my back, I told
him I wanted


170
0:7:52,606 --> 0:7:54,5
a hani with a spiderweb.


171
0:7:54,5 --> 0:7:56,74
I mean, my hani doesn't look
like a typical hani I think he


172
0:7:56,74 --> 0:7:59,23
just went for it.


173
0:7:59,23 --> 0:8:1,47
In my mind, he'd the artist,
he's doing what he's doing.


174
0:8:1,47 --> 0:8:4,1
I think he has the most fun when
people kind of approach


175
0:8:4,1 --> 0:8:4,25
it that way.


176
0:8:4,25 --> 0:8:6,5
I'm sure a lot of these tattoo
artists do, they don't want to


177
0:8:6,5 --> 0:8:9,5
be told what to do,
they're artists.


178
0:8:9,5 --> 0:8:10,75
They want to push it,
they want to go.


179
0:8:10,75 --> 0:8:15,48



180
0:8:15,48 --> 0:8:17,19
I don't know if he has
a favorite piece.


181
0:8:17,19 --> 0:8:19,65
I know whenever I see him, I'm
always kind of blown away.


182
0:8:19,65 --> 0:8:21,3
Like, the other day he was
doing a Phoenix that


183
0:8:21,3 --> 0:8:21,71
I thought was cool.


184
0:8:21,71 --> 0:8:25,96
Like it was just deep
purples and stuff.


185
0:8:25,96 --> 0:8:28,345
I always like-- he does great
stuff with heads.


186
0:8:28,345 --> 0:8:30,45
Someone he was doing a leg
sleeve on, it was like seven


187
0:8:30,45 --> 0:8:31,14
severed heads.


188
0:8:31,14 --> 0:8:33,59
It was just gory and raw,
and I think he was just


189
0:8:33,59 --> 0:8:36,669
having fun with it.


190
0:8:36,669 --> 0:8:39,1
I grew up with Mike, I know
Mike, I know he's an awesome


191
0:8:39,1 --> 0:8:39,409
tattoo artist.


192
0:8:39,409 --> 0:8:42,5
To see it in a different
setting, really kind of go,


193
0:8:42,5 --> 0:8:44,46
holy cow, this guy's a name.


194
0:8:44,46 --> 0:8:45,913
And I'm great friends
with him.


195
0:8:45,913 --> 0:8:49,23
He's like almost a celebrity
in this little circle.


196
0:8:49,23 --> 0:8:52,57
GREZ: One thing I've observed
about Mike is that he always


197
0:8:52,57 --> 0:8:54,23
continues to have


198
0:8:54,23 --> 0:8:55,48
relationships with these people.


199
0:8:55,48 --> 0:8:57,92
Because he's got
the mayor feel.


200
0:8:57,92 --> 0:9:2,24
He knows everyone's name,
shaking everyone's hands.


201
0:9:2,24 --> 0:9:4,96
I was working one day at the
shop, the door opens and I


202
0:9:4,96 --> 0:9:6,69
hear, Mikey!


203
0:9:6,69 --> 0:9:10,24
And I look up, I'm like, that's
Steve Guttenberg.


204
0:9:10,24 --> 0:9:14,2
I remember him from Police
Academy, and he's walking


205
0:9:14,2 --> 0:9:14,9
around looking for Mike.


206
0:9:14,9 --> 0:9:17,88
MIKE RUBENDALL: Him and his dad
came into the shop to get


207
0:9:17,88 --> 0:9:23,7
matching tattoos, and his
mother found out--


208
0:9:23,7 --> 0:9:24,61
oh, look at this.


209
0:9:24,61 --> 0:9:25,78
There they are!


210
0:9:25,78 --> 0:9:28,89
Holy shit.


211
0:9:28,89 --> 0:9:29,8
Speak of the devil.


212
0:9:29,8 --> 0:9:30,67
JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: Hey!


213
0:9:30,67 --> 0:9:31,58
MIKE RUBENDALL: Look at this.


214
0:9:31,58 --> 0:9:33,7
JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: Are
you filming for your


215
0:9:33,7 --> 0:9:33,67
documentary right now?


216
0:9:33,67 --> 0:9:34,53
MIKE RUBENDALL: Yeah,
right now, baby.


217
0:9:34,53 --> 0:9:35,35
JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: All right,
you want to go to the


218
0:9:35,35 --> 0:9:35,52
pizza shop?


219
0:9:35,52 --> 0:9:36,4
MIKE RUBENDALL: Sure.


220
0:9:36,4 --> 0:9:36,81
STEVE GUTTENBERG: Mikey boy.


221
0:9:36,81 --> 0:9:37,38
MIKE RUBENDALL: How
you doing, buddy?


222
0:9:37,38 --> 0:9:38,15
JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: Steve,
you got five minutes?


223
0:9:38,15 --> 0:9:38,69
MIKE RUBENDALL: You
got a minute?


224
0:9:38,69 --> 0:9:39,96
JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: They're
doing a tattoo documentary.


225
0:9:39,96 --> 0:9:40,87
STEVE GUTTENBERG:
Tattoo on you?


226
0:9:40,87 --> 0:9:42,47
MIKE RUBENDALL: Say a couple
of kind words?


227
0:9:42,47 --> 0:9:44,88
JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: Yeah,
you're the guy, Massapequa.


228
0:9:44,88 --> 0:9:46,43
STEVE GUTTENBERG: I got to lie.


229
0:9:46,43 --> 0:9:46,436
Oh, no.


230
0:9:46,436 --> 0:9:47,75
MIKE RUBENDALL: You
got to lie?


231
0:9:47,75 --> 0:9:49,15
STEVE GUTTENBERG: Mikey,
you look great man.


232
0:9:49,15 --> 0:9:49,5
You look terriffic.


233
0:9:49,5 --> 0:9:50,3
MIKE RUBENDALL: You, too, man.


234
0:9:50,3 --> 0:9:50,54
How's everything?


235
0:9:50,54 --> 0:9:51,8
STEVE GUTTENBERG: It's good.


236
0:9:51,8 --> 0:9:53,16
I'll see you at the shop.


237
0:9:53,16 --> 0:9:53,72
MIKE RUBENDALL: OK, cool.


238
0:9:53,72 --> 0:9:54,64
JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: This
is the first place


239
0:9:54,64 --> 0:9:55,97
that Michael worked.


240
0:9:55,97 --> 0:9:57,905
Came in a young man, what,
15 years old, Mike?


241
0:9:57,905 --> 0:9:58,71
MIKE RUBENDALL: Yeah.


242
0:9:58,71 --> 0:10:0,29
JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: 15
years old, [INAUDIBLE]


243
0:10:0,29 --> 0:10:1,26
Mike Rubendall.


244
0:10:1,26 --> 0:10:2,23
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, Mike.


245
0:10:2,23 --> 0:10:3,19
MIKE RUBENDALL: What's
up, Frank?


246
0:10:3,19 --> 0:10:3,68
How are you man?


247
0:10:3,68 --> 0:10:5,374
Good to see you.


248
0:10:5,374 --> 0:10:8,675
JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: Larry's our
manager here, he told me


249
0:10:8,675 --> 0:10:10,104
not to hire Michael Rubendall.


250
0:10:10,104 --> 0:10:11,32
I don't know why.


251
0:10:11,32 --> 0:10:12,424
Why is that, Larry?


252
0:10:12,424 --> 0:10:13,816
LARRY: I don't know.


253
0:10:13,816 --> 0:10:15,77
GREZ: It's like he hasn't
burned any bridges.


254
0:10:15,77 --> 0:10:18,25
All the people he grew up with,
they all still live in


255
0:10:18,25 --> 0:10:18,9
Long Island.


256
0:10:18,9 --> 0:10:21,255
He remembers everyone, he
takes care of everybody.


257
0:10:21,255 --> 0:10:23,203
MIKE RUBENDALL: Yo, Ed!


258
0:10:23,203 --> 0:10:24,185
ED: Mike!


259
0:10:24,185 --> 0:10:25,23
MIKE RUBENDALL: My man.


260
0:10:25,23 --> 0:10:26,17
ED: Welcome to New York.


261
0:10:26,17 --> 0:10:26,71
MIKE RUBENDALL: You're back?


262
0:10:26,71 --> 0:10:28,595
GREZ: You know, some of the
characters that he hangs out


263
0:10:28,595 --> 0:10:29,99
with are so entertaining.


264
0:10:29,99 --> 0:10:32,7
MIKE RUBENDALL: This
guy's a legend.


265
0:10:32,7 --> 0:10:33,765
Say something to the camera.


266
0:10:33,765 --> 0:10:37,576
ED: Next time I get a tattoo,
it's going to be a pizza pie


267
0:10:37,576 --> 0:10:41,878
right on my arm, Mikey
Rubendall style.


268
0:10:41,878 --> 0:10:45,59
GREZ: It's incredible how much
he brings from the world to


269
0:10:45,59 --> 0:10:46,84
Massapequa.


270
0:10:46,84 --> 0:10:48,7



271
0:10:48,7 --> 0:10:51,2
It's special, because we
have the train there


272
0:10:51,2 --> 0:10:52,7
and all these people--


273
0:10:52,7 --> 0:10:53,27
the taxi cab drivers.


274
0:10:53,27 --> 0:10:55,85
Every time our clients would
come in, it's like oh my God,


275
0:10:55,85 --> 0:10:58,29
this taxi cab driver is chewing
my ear off about how


276
0:10:58,29 --> 0:11:1,5
he brought three people from
Europe last week and two


277
0:11:1,5 --> 0:11:2,83
people from California.


278
0:11:2,83 --> 0:11:4,49
None of them can believe
that so many people


279
0:11:4,49 --> 0:11:5,68
travel just for a tattoo.


280
0:11:5,68 --> 0:11:7,86
MALE SPEAKER: You said that
you've taken some people to


281
0:11:7,86 --> 0:11:8,71
the tattoo parlor before?


282
0:11:8,71 --> 0:11:12,45
JUAN SUAREZ: I take a
lot of people there.


283
0:11:12,45 --> 0:11:14,53
When they come in, I
usually ask them


284
0:11:14,53 --> 0:11:16,34
where do you come from?


285
0:11:16,34 --> 0:11:20,9
Oh, from the city, one guy
Pennsylvania, another guy from


286
0:11:20,9 --> 0:11:23,38
some different places.


287
0:11:23,38 --> 0:11:24,79
Yeah, we do, we do--


288
0:11:24,79 --> 0:11:29,91
we drop them off, pick them up,
I know the place by heart.


289
0:11:29,91 --> 0:11:32,57
MIKE RUBENDALL: It's flattering
because people come


290
0:11:32,57 --> 0:11:33,36
all over the world.


291
0:11:33,36 --> 0:11:37,45
And people live down the block
from the shop, and they're


292
0:11:37,45 --> 0:11:39,72
just happy to get tattooed.


293
0:11:39,72 --> 0:11:43,72
Some of them don't even know how
successful the shop is, or


294
0:11:43,72 --> 0:11:46,665
that the job is world renowned,
or that people come


295
0:11:46,665 --> 0:11:47,72
in from all over the world.


296
0:11:47,72 --> 0:11:50,87
They're just like, oh, he's
local, he does a good job,


297
0:11:50,87 --> 0:11:51,735
he's a nice guy.


298
0:11:51,735 --> 0:11:54,193
That's all we need,
the simple life.


299
0:11:54,193 --> 0:13:54,193
