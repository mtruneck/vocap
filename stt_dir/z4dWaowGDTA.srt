2
0:0:10,39 --> 0:0:13,19
KRISHNA: Hey guys, we're in
Sweden to learn about a quirky


3
0:0:13,19 --> 0:0:15,98
geopolitical phenomenon
called micronations.


4
0:0:15,98 --> 0:0:18,86
They're sort of small
self-declared countries that


5
0:0:18,86 --> 0:0:21,42
aren't actually recognized by
any other official government.


6
0:0:21,42 --> 0:0:24,1
Sweden has several of them, and
we're going to see two,


7
0:0:24,1 --> 0:0:26,38
along with my co-pilot, Chris.


8
0:0:26,38 --> 0:0:26,74
CHRIS: Hi, Krishna.


9
0:0:26,74 --> 0:0:27,22
How are you doing?


10
0:0:27,22 --> 0:0:27,84
KRISHNA: Good, Chris.


11
0:0:27,84 --> 0:0:28,68
What time is it?


12
0:0:28,68 --> 0:0:29,77
CHRIS: It's three in
the afternoon.


13
0:0:29,77 --> 0:0:30,76
KRISHNA: It's 3:00 PM.


14
0:0:30,76 --> 0:0:32,52
And as you can see,
the sun has set.


15
0:0:32,52 --> 0:0:35,34
Because it's Sweden in
the winter time.


16
0:0:35,34 --> 0:0:37,89
So we're going to have to wake
up bright and early, like 9


17
0:0:37,89 --> 0:0:40,16
o'clock, when the sun comes
up, to get our start.


18
0:0:40,16 --> 0:0:46,47



19
0:0:46,47 --> 0:0:48,63
So Chris, tell me a little
bit more about yourself.


20
0:0:48,63 --> 0:0:51,53
CHRIS: Basically, after years
of disillusionment in my


21
0:0:51,53 --> 0:0:54,59
chosen profession as a
geotechnical engineer, just


22
0:0:54,59 --> 0:0:57,41
hating on it, I jumped in
a boat and disappeared.


23
0:0:57,41 --> 0:0:58,85
KRISHNA: Whoa.


24
0:0:58,85 --> 0:1:2,6
CHRIS: I went to Canada, hung
out, snowboarded for a while.


25
0:1:2,6 --> 0:1:4,17
And so where are
we off to, man?


26
0:1:4,17 --> 0:1:7,28
KRISHNA: We're going to the
kingdom of Ladonia.


27
0:1:7,28 --> 0:1:9,88
It's a micronation in
the south of Sweden.


28
0:1:9,88 --> 0:1:10,43
CHRIS: Yeah.


29
0:1:10,43 --> 0:1:13,49
KRISHNA: And it was started by
this artists, Lars Vilks.


30
0:1:13,49 --> 0:1:17,1
And he was a pretty
controversial, provocative


31
0:1:17,1 --> 0:1:21,1
artist, who made
these two giant


32
0:1:21,1 --> 0:1:23,25
sculptures on a nature reserve.


33
0:1:23,25 --> 0:1:24,54
Which you're not
allowed to do.


34
0:1:24,54 --> 0:1:26,26
And so people were very
upset about it.


35
0:1:26,26 --> 0:1:27,79
The government tried
to take it down.


36
0:1:27,79 --> 0:1:32,13
So in an effort to keep that
sculpture up, he formed this


37
0:1:32,13 --> 0:1:33,8
micronation called Ladonia.


38
0:1:33,8 --> 0:1:36,97
CHRIS: So this guy might
be crazy or--


39
0:1:36,97 --> 0:1:38,56
KRISHNA: It's really
hard to tell.


40
0:1:38,56 --> 0:1:45,0
Crazy enough, at least, to start
a nation called Ladonia.


41
0:1:45,0 --> 0:1:46,27
Hey, Lars.


42

0:1:51,74 --> 0:1:52,62
Just follow me.


47
0:1:52,62 --> 0:1:54,97
CHRIS: So as I've noticed, we're
being followed by two


48
0:1:54,97 --> 0:1:56,19
guys with earpieces in.


49
0:1:56,19 --> 0:1:58,47
What's going on there?


50
0:1:58,47 --> 0:2:1,51
LARS: That's been going
on for almost a year.


51
0:2:1,51 --> 0:2:2,9
They are body guards.


52
0:2:2,9 --> 0:2:5,9
And from the secret police.


53
0:2:5,9 --> 0:2:9,389
One exhibition I had a drawing
of the prophet Muhammad.


54
0:2:9,389 --> 0:2:12,93
And this one actually
was discussed and


55
0:2:12,93 --> 0:2:14,31
published in a newspaper.


56
0:2:14,31 --> 0:2:18,6
And Al Qaeda finally put
a price on my head,


57
0:2:18,6 --> 0:2:20,5
$150,000 on my head.


58

63
0:2:34,15 --> 0:2:36,27

and we have Ladonia

in Sweden,

an actual border?

find out where one country


76

of Ladonia.

when I was doing some


116
0:4:19,91 --> 0:4:21,29
art projects here.


117
0:4:21,29 --> 0:4:22,78
And I found a lot of
driftwood here.

So I started to build
with that.

reserve, is that right?

0:4:26,7 --> 0:4:27,93
So you've built--

even though it was prohibited
to build


122
0:4:29,43 --> 0:4:31,41
here, you built something.

KRISHNA: So are you sort
of at war with Sweden?

0:4:33,66 --> 0:4:34,76
Do you feel like--


126
0:4:34,76 --> 0:4:37,32
LARS: This was this other court
case that was removing


127
0:4:37,32 --> 0:4:38,42
the pieces.


128
0:4:38,42 --> 0:4:40,14
The first was the
criminal act.


129
0:4:40,14 --> 0:4:42,51
But then we have the court,
where they're


130
0:4:42,51 --> 0:4:44,5
moving away the pieces.


131
0:4:44,5 --> 0:4:47,5
And I got away with that because
I sold the piece.


132
0:4:47,5 --> 0:4:49,82
So if they want to remove it,
they have to go through him.


133
0:4:49,82 --> 0:4:51,22
Swedish law doesn't work here.


134
0:4:51,22 --> 0:4:51,9
It's illegal.

0:4:51,9 --> 0:4:53,57
They can't to move it away.


136
0:4:53,57 --> 0:4:57,56
So that was the basic
idea for Ladonia.

Here we have something which is
not controlled by Sweden.

that this is Ladonia?

as a country?

it is a joke.

it's a joke.

I'm putting on.

are two sides of it.

There's a serious conservation
aspect, but also playful, or

0:6:57,13 --> 0:6:58,34
maybe a joking aspect.

uniforms, a lot of medallions.

of state, you're expected

to be a very strong man.

the two sides of Jamtland.

Jamtland's less serious side.

237
0:8:40,47 --> 0:8:40,84
Correct?


238
0:8:40,84 --> 0:8:41,74
PETER: Yes, that's correct.


239
0:8:41,74 --> 0:8:42,83
KRISHNA: So what do
most people in

Jamtland do for a living?

0:8:44,55 --> 0:8:47,24
PETER: I think they
live on tourists.

KRISHNA: I see.

0:8:55,66 --> 0:8:58,1
PETER: Hunting is very important
for Jamtland.


247
0:8:58,1 --> 0:9:2,34
A lot of people in Jamtland
hunt, almost moose.

0:9:2,34 --> 0:9:2,69

and being in the

252
0:9:7,55 --> 0:9:9,82

moose in the forest, and

0:9:13,5 --> 0:9:16,111

are the only dogs that will

actually not be scared
of a bear, and will
