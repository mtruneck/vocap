1
0:0:4,53 --> 0:0:9,6
The first thing I want to do is plot my
holes for the net pots onto the system.


2
0:0:9,6 --> 0:0:14,1
This system in particular is going to have
six holes so I am going to go ahead


3
0:0:14,1 --> 0:0:34,56
and cut those out right now
with my 3 inch hole saw.


4
0:0:34,56 --> 0:0:39,35
All right, so we now have all of our holes cut.
All right, so the next thing I am going


5
0:0:39,35 --> 0:0:44,51
to do is I want to lay out my pattern
that I am going to be using.


6
0:0:44,51 --> 0:0:48,53
So I will just grab all my fittings.


7
0:0:48,53 --> 0:1:4,25
I got some t-joints and some 90째 and I
just want to layout where I want to have


8
0:1:4,25 --> 0:1:12,93
everything sort of set.
So the 90째 are going to be on the edges,


9
0:1:12,93 --> 0:1:15,22
all right.


10
0:1:15,22 --> 0:1:25,96
The two joints --


11
0:1:25,96 --> 0:1:30,21
All right, so what I have laid out here is sort of my pattern.


12
0:1:30,21 --> 0:1:39,44
Now the 90째 is going to create sort of
the rectangle around the edge with like


13
0:1:39,44 --> 0:1:45,34
the t-joints in the middle are going
to connect up to create a center piece


14
0:1:45,34 --> 0:1:51,13
and then this middle t-joint is actually going
to point downwards and that is going to


15
0:1:51,13 --> 0:1:54,8
connect to the reservoir pup in the bottom


16
0:1:54,8 --> 0:1:59,48
and then I am going to use these two joints
on the either side to create the lays.


17
0:1:59,48 --> 0:2:6,16
So the next thing I want to do is cut the
pipe for length so for this I am going to


18
0:2:6,16 --> 0:2:11,39
use this pipe cutting tool that you can
pick up at any home depot or whatever.


19
0:2:11,39 --> 0:2:16,63
It cost about 10 bucks and I am going to
use the length of the pipe so what I want


20
0:2:16,63 --> 0:2:22,19
to do is measure out the length of the
pipe that I am going to need for each of


21
0:2:22,19 --> 0:2:27,14
the fittings.


22
0:2:27,14 --> 0:2:31,9
Okay, so I am just about finished cutting
up all my pieces, but what I want to do


23
0:2:31,9 --> 0:2:36,44
before I move along is I want to dry
fit everything and make sure it fits.


24
0:2:36,44 --> 0:3:7,9
So all you have to do is just place
all the pieces together.


25
0:3:7,9 --> 0:3:14,48
I am going to go ahead and
markup our final piece.


26
0:3:14,48 --> 0:3:19,9
Get ready to mark your final piece.


27
0:3:19,9 --> 0:3:23,94
What you want to make sure you do when you
are doing your marking is you want to have


28
0:3:23,94 --> 0:3:31,14
about a half a centimeter inside to about
half a centimeter on the inside here as


29
0:3:31,14 --> 0:3:40,14
well so let's go ahead and mark that there.


30
0:3:40,14 --> 0:3:51,27
Right, so I am going to show you how the
clamp works, but just basically pull the


31
0:3:51,27 --> 0:4:3,18
clamp apart to reveal the blade and then
find your mark and then you want to place


32
0:4:3,18 --> 0:4:12,22
the blade right on to the mark by
just compressing it and once it has got a grip


33
0:4:12,22 --> 0:4:16,9
then all you got to do is just how
to use it like scissors, right.


34
0:4:16,9 --> 0:4:25,77
So you can get this last piece in.


35
0:4:25,77 --> 0:4:29,7
That is going to take a little bit of
wiggle always on the last pieces which


36
0:4:29,7 --> 0:4:33,22
is a little harder.


37
0:4:33,22 --> 0:4:37,5
So you get to see.
We have our last bit of thing.


38
0:4:37,5 --> 0:4:41,7
Now you can see one of the things that I
have done is that I have made it slightly


39
0:4:41,7 --> 0:4:49,0
smaller than the actual lid of the container.
The reason for this is most buckets


40
0:4:49,0 --> 0:4:55,42
actually get smaller on the inside so you
want to make sure that it is going to go


41
0:4:55,42 --> 0:5:0,82
in and out easily, yet that it is still
going to provide coverage to all of your


42
0:5:0,82 --> 0:5:2,66
net pots.


43
0:5:2,66 --> 0:5:10,27
Now what I bought is these micro-spray heads.
They give the 360째 spray and what we are


44
0:5:10,27 --> 0:5:16,3
going to do right now is mark out along
the pipe where we want to drill the holes


45
0:5:16,3 --> 0:5:17,92
for the spray heads.


46
0:5:17,92 --> 0:5:22,72
So if we look at where our holes are for
the net pots, we want to make sure that we


47
0:5:22,72 --> 0:5:28,9
have equal coverage kind of everywhere so
having one that right on top of the net


48
0:5:28,9 --> 0:5:34,59
pot might not necessarily be good because
as the roots grow down, they are going to


49
0:5:34,59 --> 0:5:40,94
grow down and cover these so you want to
make sure that they are sort offset, all right.


50
0:5:40,94 --> 0:5:45,9
The other thing that you can do as well


51
0:5:45,9 --> 0:5:51,21
is you can have different angles
to have different coverage.


52
0:5:51,21 --> 0:5:56,3
So what I am going to do in this case is
I am going to put my marks with a Sharpie


53
0:5:56,3 --> 0:6:1,11
wherever we think we want to have a spray that.


54
0:6:1,11 --> 0:6:8,3
So I want one that coverage in between
these two holes so I put a mark there.


55
0:6:8,3 --> 0:6:15,71
I want to have coverage in between these
two holes so put a mark there.


56
0:6:15,71 --> 0:6:24,39
Here we are going to have coverage
in between these two holes.


57
0:6:24,39 --> 0:6:32,21
Then, we are also going to have coverage
in between these two holes on this side


58
0:6:32,21 --> 0:6:35,71
and between these two holes in this side.


59
0:6:35,71 --> 0:6:42,18
We are going to make sure we have coverage
here, okay and going along here


60
0:6:42,18 --> 0:6:46,64
we are going to have coverage here,


61
0:6:46,64 --> 0:6:53,51
coverage here and then we want to make
sure that we do have some coverage on the


62
0:6:53,51 --> 0:7:5,11
edges so we are going to put one
here, here, here and there.


63
0:7:5,11 --> 0:7:8,37
And that should give us a fairly even
coverage, what we are looking to do


64
0:7:8,37 --> 0:7:12,29
is just blanket for plants completely.


65
0:7:12,29 --> 0:7:17,77
You could add a few extras if you want
but like I said basically what we are


66
0:7:17,77 --> 0:7:23,11
looking to do is make sure that they are
not directly underneath the root system


67
0:7:23,11 --> 0:7:27,81
otherwise the roots are just going to clog
up and make these unusable anyways.


68
0:7:27,81 --> 0:7:32,68
So you want to try to keep them away from
the root system, but still with very good coverage.


69
0:7:32,68 --> 0:7:39,21
In fact, I do think that we even have
better coverage if I did add an additional


70
0:7:39,21 --> 0:7:48,41
one here and additional one here as well


71
0:7:48,41 --> 0:7:53,23
and this would provide a 360
to sort of all 4 pots.


72
0:7:53,23 --> 0:7:57,77
So we are going to get a lot of coverage
with this so let's go ahead and drill out


73
0:7:57,77 --> 0:8:3,22
these wholes.


74
0:8:3,22 --> 0:8:12,21
All right, now I know that the threading
on these micro hoses are 532's so I am


75
0:8:12,21 --> 0:8:16,43
gong to use my drill bit that matches that
and what I am going to do is drill out


76
0:8:16,43 --> 0:8:19,98
each one of these holes, but I want to be
a little bit slow at it and make sure I


77
0:8:19,98 --> 0:8:22,68
only go through the first layer.


78
0:8:22,68 --> 0:8:27,77
I leave the system put together just to
kind of provide me some support and you


79
0:8:27,77 --> 0:8:33,78
want to make sure that you get somewhat
bit on you don't want to be too cockeyed right.


80
0:8:33,78 --> 0:8:52,81
So you just go through


81
0:8:52,81 --> 0:8:57,7
and that is the last hole.


82
0:8:57,7 --> 0:9:0,41
The next thing I want to do is I have a tap.


83
0:9:0,41 --> 0:9:6,18
This is going to put the threading on that
is the same thread as what is on this


84
0:9:6,18 --> 0:9:8,9
bit here, okay.


85
0:9:8,9 --> 0:9:18,36
So and that is going to create a 10/32
tap hole, and what I like to do for this


86
0:9:18,36 --> 0:9:25,94
is I like to turn my drill to its lowest setting.


87
0:9:25,94 --> 0:9:30,45
You can see how it is quite a bit slower


88
0:9:30,45 --> 0:9:47,81
and we are going to be gently tap the whole
and then reverse out and now you can


89
0:9:47,81 --> 0:9:56,38
see we have a nice thread.


90
0:9:56,38 --> 0:9:59,41
Just like that so I will go ahead
and finish the rest of them.


91
0:9:59,41 --> 0:10:4,54
All right so now that I have all my holes
tapped what I want to do is address the legs.


92
0:10:4,54 --> 0:10:9,4
So what we want to make sure is that when
this sits inside the bucket that the spray


93
0:10:9,4 --> 0:10:13,43
heads are going to evenly spray just slightly
below the bottoms of each of the


94
0:10:13,43 --> 0:10:16,85
net pots.


95
0:10:16,85 --> 0:10:22,66
So in order to do this I will just take
a net pot and kind of place it just slightly


96
0:10:22,66 --> 0:10:28,51
below the edge of our container.


97
0:10:28,51 --> 0:10:33,21
This matches the top of the bucket


98
0:10:33,21 --> 0:10:43,58
and then I am going to measure up from the
bottom and I can see from this that the


99
0:10:43,58 --> 0:10:56,23
net pot bottom here is just
at 9 inches from the top.


100
0:10:56,23 --> 0:11:8,68
So I want to keep this again slightly
below that 9 inch mark.


101
0:11:8,68 --> 0:11:19,93
To accomplish that I also want to take
into account how much pipe will be back


102
0:11:19,93 --> 0:11:24,85
into this position.


103
0:11:24,85 --> 0:11:34,45
So that is about a centimeter and
a half-ish, right so if we had that for a 9


104
0:11:34,45 --> 0:11:38,76
inch mark so it is about 8-1/2 inches.


105
0:11:38,76 --> 0:11:52,5
So basically if I place 8-1/2 inches inside
the bucket we are going to end up


106
0:11:52,5 --> 0:11:57,35
just at that, just slightly
below that 9 inch mark.


107
0:11:57,35 --> 0:12:4,16
So now what we want to do is cut
some 8-1/2 inch long pieces.


108
0:12:4,16 --> 0:12:14,77
So what I will do is I will measure out
8-1/2 inches, place my mark and start cutting.


109
0:12:14,77 --> 0:12:23,16
We are going to need four for this.


110
0:12:23,16 --> 0:12:25,77
And we got our four legs.


111
0:12:25,77 --> 0:12:29,51
All right so we got our four legs and what
I want to do at this point is try to fit


112
0:12:29,51 --> 0:12:34,99
those legs.
So I will fit flip the unit over and we


113
0:12:34,99 --> 0:12:40,4
are just going to turn each of our t-joints
and we go ahead and place our


114
0:12:40,4 --> 0:12:56,3
legs just like that.


115
0:12:56,3 --> 0:13:0,13
Now the one thing you want to keep in mind
is this entire system is going to have


116
0:13:0,13 --> 0:13:4,82
water pressure running throughout.
So unless we cap off the legs, then we


117
0:13:4,82 --> 0:13:8,66
will actually have water shooting out of
it and just become like a rocket take of


118
0:13:8,66 --> 0:13:19,29
so just get your simple end caps and we
will go ahead and cap off the legs.


119
0:13:19,29 --> 0:13:28,6
All right, now that the legs are all capped
off we can take the unit and fit it


120
0:13:28,6 --> 0:13:34,92
in to our pail to make sure everything fits good.


121
0:13:34,92 --> 0:13:39,8
You can see how we got a nice strong
sturdy support so we can go ahead and get


122
0:13:39,8 --> 0:13:45,97
ready to actually start cementing these.
Basically, what you want to do is just


123
0:13:45,97 --> 0:14:6,15
coat the edge with the solvent and then
twist it into your fitting and then any


124
0:14:6,15 --> 0:14:12,47
grips you can just clean up.


125
0:14:12,47 --> 0:14:17,59
I usually suggest that you start with your
easiest fittings first and then just move


126
0:14:17,59 --> 0:14:20,12
on to the hardest fittings next.


127
0:14:20,12 --> 0:14:27,84
So the thing I want to do now is fit
this intake valve onto the bottom there.


128
0:14:27,84 --> 0:14:41,94
You could do that much in the same way.


129
0:14:41,94 --> 0:14:56,88
Just get a little of our cement and place
it on like so and just press until firm.


130
0:14:56,88 --> 0:15:3,42
And now we will be able to attach
the hose to the bottom here.


131
0:15:3,42 --> 0:15:9,35
At this point, you want to just
let everything dry up.


132
0:15:9,35 --> 0:15:17,92
It doesn't take long to set but I usually
like to give it a good 24 hours to dry.


133
0:15:17,92 --> 0:15:22,77
And now you can see that we have all the
spray that is put into place, so all we


134
0:15:22,77 --> 0:15:27,27
have to do right now is just go ahead and
let this dry and then we can work on the


135
0:15:27,27 --> 0:15:29,7
rest of it probably tomorrow.


136
0:15:29,7 --> 0:15:38,64
One thing that you can do in the meantime
though is you will notice that I have


137
0:15:38,64 --> 0:15:44,88
started right now to sort of color
this in with sharpie and black.


138
0:15:44,88 --> 0:15:48,55
I think it is a really good idea
just how to keep the light out.


139
0:15:48,55 --> 0:15:53,8
If you have the ability to go outside and
just spray paint the lid black I would


140
0:15:53,8 --> 0:16:2,4
definitely suggest it, but if you get a
big enough Sharpie you can see that it


141
0:16:2,4 --> 0:16:10,49
is not going to take you all that long to get
this painted black on the lid so for me I


142
0:16:10,49 --> 0:16:16,4
am just going to go ahead and use a Sharpie
to get the top black and you can


143
0:16:16,4 --> 0:16:19,87
go ahead and do whatever you want.


144
0:16:19,87 --> 0:16:25,4
All right we are back on day two
and everything is nicely dry as you can see I


145
0:16:25,4 --> 0:16:31,98
have all my emitters plugged in and now
we are ready to deal with the actual feed


146
0:16:31,98 --> 0:16:33,8
system for the pump.


147
0:16:33,8 --> 0:16:40,14
So in order to do that much like my last
project I did we are going to want to make


148
0:16:40,14 --> 0:16:50,44
it notch in the bucket for our cable


149
0:16:50,44 --> 0:16:56,35
and now we can have the cable just right
inside blush with the top of the bucket.


150
0:16:56,35 --> 0:17:0,72
So that takes care of our cable.


151
0:17:0,72 --> 0:17:6,72
So I bought one of these half inch adapters
and they just screw it right into


152
0:17:6,72 --> 0:17:14,12
the top just like so and then I also have
this half inch flexible tubing so what


153
0:17:14,12 --> 0:17:24,17
happens is you just press fit right on to
the system there and then we will just go


154
0:17:24,17 --> 0:17:30,65
ahead and cut it to the length that we need
to press fit it on to that side there


155
0:17:30,65 --> 0:18:3,22
so put it in the system and go
ahead and mark it right here.


156
0:18:3,22 --> 0:18:21,0
Get a cutting tool and as you can see we
just press fit it and to the system like so.


157
0:18:21,0 --> 0:18:25,77
So now we have a good seal for the pump.


158
0:18:25,77 --> 0:18:34,29
All right, so let's place it into our system
and that looks about good there


159
0:18:34,29 --> 0:18:38,72
and basically what we want to do now is
find our water levels so this will be the


160
0:18:38,72 --> 0:18:46,2
amount of nutrient that we need and the
idea here is we don't need the nutrient to


161
0:18:46,2 --> 0:18:54,5
come up very far, what we do have to be
aware of is if you look at the side of the


162
0:18:54,5 --> 0:18:59,77
pump here you can see that there is an
intake and this is where the water


163
0:18:59,77 --> 0:19:3,52
is going to come in through and
go up to the top of the pump.


164
0:19:3,52 --> 0:19:7,74
We want to make sure that the water doesn't
drop below this level otherwise


165
0:19:7,74 --> 0:19:11,81
you have potential of burning
out your motor on the pump.


166
0:19:11,81 --> 0:19:15,93
So when we set our water levels for the
bucket we are going to want to make sure


167
0:19:15,93 --> 0:19:20,94
that we haven't probably to about this
level here, so just twice the amount of


168
0:19:20,94 --> 0:19:26,5
water that is needed to cover this.
That way when the spray had spray up we


169
0:19:26,5 --> 0:19:29,39
will be able to drop the levels
to a certain point.


170
0:19:29,39 --> 0:19:33,7
All right so as you can see
I have my fill line here.


171
0:19:33,7 --> 0:19:36,22
This is a 25 meters.


172
0:19:36,22 --> 0:19:41,89
If I was using this as deep water culture
I would have to fill it up to 44 liters to


173
0:19:41,89 --> 0:19:48,62
be able to get the same results so ultimately
quite a bit of savings there.


174
0:19:48,62 --> 0:19:53,0
So now that we have our system pretty
much ready to go one thing I do want to


175
0:19:53,0 --> 0:19:59,92
know is the fact that we do have a contained
system meaning that reservoir


176
0:19:59,92 --> 0:20:3,68
and the spray emitters are all in the same bucket.


177
0:20:3,68 --> 0:20:8,82
That means that as the roots get longer
and start growing down the task of


178
0:20:8,82 --> 0:20:11,98
spraying theirs, they are going to start
sitting in this water and it is going to


179
0:20:11,98 --> 0:20:14,2
act like a deep water culture system.


180
0:20:14,2 --> 0:20:18,67
So in order to prevent the roots from getting
rots in that area, we are going to


181
0:20:18,67 --> 0:20:22,87
still go with the same technique that we
used in my previous model of the deepwater


182
0:20:22,87 --> 0:20:28,28
culture and that is using one of these air
stones inside there to make sure that we


183
0:20:28,28 --> 0:20:29,79
keep enough oxygen.


184
0:20:29,79 --> 0:20:34,19
So I am just going to be using one of these
12 inch air stones and that will go


185
0:20:34,19 --> 0:20:40,29
right down inside of the system and what I
have done is just simply drill the whole


186
0:20:40,29 --> 0:20:49,82
at the top so that we can feed the air
tube inside, all right and basically the


187
0:20:49,82 --> 0:20:54,77
other thing I have done is made sure that
all my cables are sort of in the same


188
0:20:54,77 --> 0:20:59,36
corner so if I want to push that off to
the side then I know that everything


189
0:20:59,36 --> 0:21:1,75
is kind of coming out of the same spot.


190
0:21:1,75 --> 0:21:6,6
But that being said let's go ahead
and see this baby work.


191
0:21:6,6 --> 0:21:14,1
Now for the moment of truth...


192
0:21:14,1 --> 0:23:14,1
you got it spray everywhere without the lid on
as you can see we have a working system.
