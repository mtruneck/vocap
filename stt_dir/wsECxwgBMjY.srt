Did you get the link
I sent you?


2
0:0:7,387 --> 0:0:9,803
You've got to see this.
It's hilarious.


3
0:0:9,803 --> 0:0:10,999
Yeah, it's still loading.


4
0:0:10,999 --> 0:0:12,727
Okay, go ahead, Troy,
and make a muscle.


5
0:0:12,727 --> 0:0:17,42
All right,
check out these guns.


6
0:0:17,42 --> 0:0:19,631
Those aren't muscles.


7
0:0:19,631 --> 0:0:23,73
These are muscles.


8
0:0:23,73 --> 0:0:25,102
Kevin.
Kevin.


9
0:0:25,102 --> 0:0:26,437
Time for breakfast.


10
0:0:26,437 --> 0:0:28,674
Hey, dad.


11
0:0:28,674 --> 0:0:30,343
What are you doing, boy?


12
0:0:30,343 --> 0:0:32,413
I'm showing Troy
my muscles.


13
0:0:32,413 --> 0:0:35,18
Those aren't muscles.


14
0:0:35,18 --> 0:0:36,52
These are muscles.


15
0:0:36,52 --> 0:0:37,589
Wow.


16
0:0:37,589 --> 0:0:40,327
Wow.
My whole screen went black.


17
0:0:40,327 --> 0:0:43,633
It's like a bicep eclipse.


18
0:0:43,633 --> 0:0:45,1
Kevin's got to go
eat breakfast.


19
0:0:45,1 --> 0:0:46,503
He'll see you later, Troy.


20
0:0:46,503 --> 0:0:48,806
Bye, Mr. Kingston-Persons.


21
0:0:48,806 --> 0:0:53,279
Catch you later.


22
0:0:53,279 --> 0:0:55,181
Kevin.


23
0:0:55,181 --> 0:0:57,585
Kevin, do you have my lotion
in here again?


24
0:0:57,585 --> 0:0:59,622
I can't believe
it's so round.


25
0:0:59,622 --> 0:1:0,523
It's, like, out there.


26
0:1:0,523 --> 0:1:3,59
I mean, it's gross.
Look.


27
0:1:3,59 --> 0:1:6,62

It's an old lady dancing
to <i>Baby Got Back.</i>

I love dancing
to that song,


62
0:2:20,608 --> 0:2:26,649

looking like a ghetto Lady Gaga.

I didn't know you could dance
like that, mom.


80
0:3:13,568 --> 0:3:16,337
Well, you weren't supposed
to find out on the Internet.


81
0:3:16,337 --> 0:3:17,438
It's no big deal.


82
0:3:17,438 --> 0:3:19,305
Cats are put online
all the time.


83

Doesn't seem to bother them,

0:3:31,115 --> 0:3:33,151
I am not a cat.


90
0:3:33,151 --> 0:3:35,787
I'm a wife and a working woman
and a mother,


91
0:3:35,787 --> 0:3:37,355
and I'm not hilarious.


92
0:3:37,355 --> 0:3:39,824
How did this video
even get on there?


93
0:3:39,824 --> 0:3:42,293
Did you record your mother
without her knowing it?


94
0:3:42,293 --> 0:3:43,661
Ew, no.


95
0:3:43,661 --> 0:3:45,43
Did you leave your webcam
running?


96
0:3:45,43 --> 0:3:47,265
I don't know.


97
0:3:47,265 --> 0:3:48,666
Maybe.


98
0:3:48,666 --> 0:3:50,468
Probably.


99
0:3:50,468 --> 0:3:53,137
I guess, yeah.


100
0:3:53,137 --> 0:3:55,873
Man, I told you, you got
to be careful about that.


101
0:3:55,873 --> 0:3:57,206
You leave your webcam running,


102
0:3:57,206 --> 0:3:59,608
people can capture video on
what they see from your computer


103
0:3:59,608 --> 0:4:1,175
whether you're there or not.


104
0:4:1,175 --> 0:4:3,643
I can't believe
this happened.


105
0:4:3,643 --> 0:4:5,645
I'm on the Internet
in my drawers


106
0:4:5,645 --> 0:4:8,379
doing the big butt dance.


107
0:4:8,379 --> 0:4:10,248

What is wrong
with you, man?


117
0:4:39,107 --> 0:4:42,76

why I'm here.

I thought you invited me over
here to eat dinner, not make it.


124
0:4:53,185 --> 0:4:55,387
If I'd have told you Suzanne
and I were having a problem,


125

129
0:5:0,291 --> 0:5:2,393
I mean,
other than the obvious.


130
0:5:2,393 --> 0:5:4,595
It's a long story.


131
0:5:4,595 --> 0:5:6,697
Well, it better be over

134
0:5:10,2 --> 0:5:11,167
Hot.


135
0:5:11,167 --> 0:5:14,17
Ma.
What?


136
0:5:14,17 --> 0:5:20,875
How do you think
you got here?


137
0:5:20,875 --> 0:5:23,277
I just feel so violated.


138
0:5:23,277 --> 0:5:25,879
You know, it's like I was
spied on in my own house.


139
0:5:25,879 --> 0:5:28,481
What else can record me
without my knowing it?


140
0:5:28,481 --> 0:5:30,949
Well, technically, anything
that can receive a signal


141
0:5:30,949 --> 0:5:32,35
can transmit a signal.


142
0:5:32,35 --> 0:5:36,487
So the tv, telephone,
radio, headphones.


143
0:5:36,487 --> 0:5:38,21
Ugh, you're not helping.


144
0:5:38,21 --> 0:5:40,56
I'm just trying
to answer your question.


145
0:5:40,56 --> 0:5:41,791
Okay, Nick,
you're an I.T. guy.


146
0:5:41,791 --> 0:5:43,191
This is your world.


147
0:5:43,191 --> 0:5:45,626
Isn't there some way to get
the video off the Internet?


148
0:5:45,626 --> 0:5:48,197
Well, unfortunately,
once something's up on the Web,


149
0:5:48,197 --> 0:5:49,6
it's there for good.


150
0:5:49,6 --> 0:5:51,334
But don't worry about it.


151
0:5:51,334 --> 0:5:54,337
This will go away.
You're not Kim Kardashian.


152
0:5:54,337 --> 0:5:56,72
This week, it's you.


153
0:5:56,72 --> 0:5:59,241
Next week, it'll be
a cat in a fishbowl.


154
0:5:59,241 --> 0:6:1,509

155
0:6:1,509 --> 0:6:3,712

156
0:6:3,712 --> 0:6:6,18
Look, you can't even tell
it's you.


157
0:6:6,18 --> 0:6:7,548

158
0:6:7,548 --> 0:6:8,649

No, you don't understand.


165
0:6:23,411 --> 0:6:25,646
I didn't put it
on the Internet.


166
0:6:25,646 --> 0:6:27,581
Hello?
Hello?


167
0:6:27,581 --> 0:6:28,882
Who's that?


168
0:6:28,882 --> 0:6:30,784
I just had
another client cancel


169
0:6:30,784 --> 0:6:34,888
because they saw the video.


170
0:6:34,888 --> 0:6:37,49
Mom, what are you doing
with my computer?


171
0:6:37,49 --> 0:6:39,659
It's my computer
until you learn


172
0:6:39,659 --> 0:6:41,327
what that thing
is capable of.


173
0:6:41,327 --> 0:6:42,628
I know
what it's capable of.


174
0:6:42,628 --> 0:6:44,53
That's why I don't want you
to take it.


175
0:6:44,53 --> 0:6:46,599
How am I supposed to communicate
with my friends?


176
0:6:46,599 --> 0:6:48,665
Talk to them.
How?


177
0:6:48,665 --> 0:6:50,64
Face-to-face.


178
0:6:50,64 --> 0:6:51,998

179
0:6:51,998 --> 0:6:53,199
You know, Suzanne,


180
0:6:53,199 --> 0:6:54,801
I don't think the video's
that big a deal.


181
0:6:54,801 --> 0:6:56,235
I mean, it's not like
it's a sex tape.


182
0:6:56,235 --> 0:6:57,836
Though it'd be better for you
if it were,


183
0:6:57,836 --> 0:6:59,905
because I guarantee nobody
would want to see that.


184
0:6:59,905 --> 0:7:1,506
Aren't you supposed
to be eating?


185
0:7:1,506 --> 0:7:4,375
I would if I had
some real food.


186
0:7:4,375 --> 0:7:5,81
You don't like
peppered salmon?


187
0:7:5,81 --> 0:7:7,144
It's mom's specialty.


188
0:7:7,144 --> 0:7:8,812
Specialty, huh?


189
0:7:8,812 --> 0:7:11,815
Lindsey, you need to learn
how to cook some real food,


190
0:7:11,815 --> 0:7:14,418
because you are not gonna
get a man cooking like this.


191
0:7:14,418 --> 0:7:16,62
I got a man
cooking like this.


192
0:7:16,62 --> 0:7:18,721
Baby, believe me,
it was not your cooking.


193
0:7:18,721 --> 0:7:21,991
Maybe it was your dancing.


194
0:7:21,991 --> 0:7:24,626
I want a man to like me
for my mind and my personality,


195
0:7:24,626 --> 0:7:26,328
not how I look
or how I cook.


196
0:7:26,328 --> 0:7:29,497
I had one of those once.
It gets old fast, trust me.


197
0:7:29,497 --> 0:7:31,665
Maybe that's not
what got old.


198
0:7:31,665 --> 0:7:33,4
You guys gonna eat
or you gonna fight?


199
0:7:33,4 --> 0:7:35,569
All I'm saying is,
I need to teach Lindsey


200
0:7:35,569 --> 0:7:37,503
how to cook
some real soul food.


201
0:7:37,503 --> 0:7:38,87
What's soul food?


202
0:7:38,87 --> 0:7:42,72
The number two cause of death
in black men over 40.


203
0:7:42,72 --> 0:7:43,307
What's the number one cause?


204
0:7:43,307 --> 0:7:51,547
Stress.
Now, eat, please.


205
0:7:51,547 --> 0:7:56,953
Butter, butter,
lard,


206
0:7:56,953 --> 0:7:58,321
chicken.


207
0:7:58,321 --> 0:8:1,824
What is wrong with this thing?
It looks disgusting.


208
0:8:1,824 --> 0:8:4,392
What the heck is all this stuff
wrapped around it?


209
0:8:4,392 --> 0:8:6,895
That's called the skin.


210
0:8:6,895 --> 0:8:8,563
Ew!


211
0:8:8,563 --> 0:8:11,32
No, you mean, "mmm."


212
0:8:11,32 --> 0:8:14,236
You see, the skin is what gives
the chicken the flavor.


213
0:8:14,236 --> 0:8:16,671
Is this an organic
free-range chicken?


214
0:8:16,671 --> 0:8:19,707
No, it's a flavorful
hard-knock-life chicken.


215
0:8:19,707 --> 0:8:23,31
If that chicken was a rapper,
it'd be Tupac.


216
0:8:23,31 --> 0:8:25,779
Ooh.
What do we need vodka for?


217
0:8:25,779 --> 0:8:34,19
I'll give you a hint:
It's not for the chicken.


218
0:8:34,19 --> 0:8:35,721
Mom!


219
0:8:35,721 --> 0:8:43,262
Mom!


220
0:8:43,262 --> 0:8:44,696
Kevin.


221
0:8:44,696 --> 0:8:47,365
Why do you have your computer
when I took it away from you?


222
0:8:47,365 --> 0:8:48,899
I thought my punishment
was over.


223
0:8:48,899 --> 0:8:49,999
Nuh-uh.


224
0:8:49,999 --> 0:8:51,734
I was just gonna watch
a video.


225
0:8:51,734 --> 0:8:53,102
Were you gonna watch
the video,


226
0:8:53,102 --> 0:8:55,671
or was the video
going to watch you?


227
0:8:55,671 --> 0:8:57,572
Go put that computer
up in my bedroom,


228
0:8:57,572 --> 0:8:59,441
and I don't want to see it
back in your hands


229
0:8:59,441 --> 0:9:1,75
until I put it there.


230
0:9:1,75 --> 0:9:8,948
Yes, ma'am.


231
0:9:8,948 --> 0:9:10,683
Hi, Mrs. Kingston-Persons.


232
0:9:10,683 --> 0:9:12,151
Hi, Troy.
Hi, Jackie.


233
0:9:12,151 --> 0:9:13,919
Come on in.


234
0:9:13,919 --> 0:9:15,688
Suzanne, can I talk to you
for a moment?


235
0:9:15,688 --> 0:9:17,356
Sure.


236
0:9:17,356 --> 0:9:21,592
Suzanne, you need to be more
responsible with your child.


237
0:9:21,592 --> 0:9:22,993
What are you talking about?


238
0:9:22,993 --> 0:9:25,295
Well, Troy was recording
his Web chat


239
0:9:25,295 --> 0:9:26,53
with Kevin the other day,


240
0:9:26,53 --> 0:9:28,532
and the next thing he knows,
you're in the room


241
0:9:28,532 --> 0:9:31,968
dancing around
like Tila Tequila.


242
0:9:31,968 --> 0:9:33,536
I was shocked.


243
0:9:33,536 --> 0:9:36,205
Wait a minute.
Troy did this?


244
0:9:36,205 --> 0:9:38,573
And you're upset with me
because he recorded me


245
0:9:38,573 --> 0:9:40,375
in the privacy
of my own home?


246
0:9:40,375 --> 0:9:41,977
He wouldn't have had
anything to record


247
0:9:41,977 --> 0:9:44,12
if you were
a little more responsible.


248
0:9:44,12 --> 0:9:46,715
I used to think
the Internet was safe,


249
0:9:46,715 --> 0:9:48,116
but now...


250
0:9:48,116 --> 0:9:50,485
If you're so responsible,
Jackie,


251
0:9:50,485 --> 0:9:52,62
than why is your son
posting videos of people


252
0:9:52,62 --> 0:9:54,55
all over the Internet?


253
0:9:54,55 --> 0:9:56,57
For your information,


254
0:9:56,57 --> 0:9:58,26
he's not posting videos
of people.


255
0:9:58,26 --> 0:9:59,995
He posted a video of you


256
0:9:59,995 --> 0:10:2,262
because the rest of the people
weren't dancing around


257
0:10:2,262 --> 0:10:4,995
in their underwear.


258
0:10:4,995 --> 0:10:9,498
I feel like my innocence
has been taken from me.


259
0:10:9,498 --> 0:10:12,0
Are you at least going
to make him say he's sorry?


260
0:10:12,0 --> 0:10:15,135
Do you have any idea
how many people might see this?


261
0:10:15,135 --> 0:10:17,27
1/2 million,
but that was just yesterday.


262
0:10:17,27 --> 0:10:24,309
By tomorrow, you'll probably
pass <i>printer cat.</i>


263
0:10:24,309 --> 0:10:26,144
What is so funny?


264
0:10:26,144 --> 0:10:29,28
I was just thinking
about printer cat.


265
0:10:29,28 --> 0:10:30,314
Fump! Fump!


266
0:10:30,314 --> 0:10:33,182
Fump!


267
0:10:33,182 --> 0:10:35,45
Okay, if it makes you feel
any better,


268
0:10:35,45 --> 0:10:37,952
Troy, just say you're sorry.


269
0:10:37,952 --> 0:10:41,588
Sorry, Mrs. Kingston-Persons.


270
0:10:41,588 --> 0:10:44,557
I hope you're satisfied.


271
0:10:44,557 --> 0:10:54,766
You need to be more responsible
with your child.


272
0:10:54,766 --> 0:10:58,169
Ooh, if that lady pointed her
finger at me one more time...


273
0:10:58,169 --> 0:11:2,773
Goodness gracious.


274
0:11:2,773 --> 0:11:5,643
I'm telling you, man,
Suzanne's video is huge.


275
0:11:5,643 --> 0:11:7,444
She's, like,
the featured video of the day


276
0:11:7,444 --> 0:11:9,245
on 15 different websites.


277
0:11:9,245 --> 0:11:11,947
You're wife might be
the next Star Wars Kid.


278
0:11:11,947 --> 0:11:14,249
My wife is not gonna be
the next Star Wars Kid.


279
0:11:14,249 --> 0:11:15,216
Turn it off.


280
0:11:15,216 --> 0:11:16,751
Turn what off?
Nothing.


281
0:11:16,751 --> 0:11:19,32
Just some stupid cat videos.


282
0:11:19,32 --> 0:11:22,189
Oh, well, you guys must be
the only ones watching that,


283
0:11:22,189 --> 0:11:24,925
because everyone else
seems to be watching me.


284
0:11:24,925 --> 0:11:28,6
Did you know that video of me
has over 1/2 million hits?


285
0:11:28,6 --> 0:11:29,829
That was yesterday.


286
0:11:29,829 --> 0:11:32,131
Today it's more like
3 1/2 million.


287
0:11:32,131 --> 0:11:33,598
What?
Oh, yeah.


288
0:11:33,598 --> 0:11:35,967
You better hope that none of
those kids watching this video


289
0:11:35,967 --> 0:11:38,102
is good with Photoshop.


290
0:11:38,102 --> 0:11:39,136
Ow.


291
0:11:39,136 --> 0:11:40,737
Nick, you're my man,


292
0:11:40,737 --> 0:11:42,872
and you said
that this was gonna go away.


293
0:11:42,872 --> 0:11:44,741
So I don't know
how you're gonna do it,


294
0:11:44,741 --> 0:11:46,876
but you have got to get
that video off the Web.


295
0:11:46,876 --> 0:11:48,11
What am I supposed to do?


296
0:11:48,11 --> 0:11:50,445
I can't just shut down
the Internet.


297
0:11:50,445 --> 0:11:56,151
Have you tried?


298
0:11:56,151 --> 0:11:57,686
Listen, man,
you do what you need to do,


299
0:11:57,686 --> 0:11:59,2
but if you shut down
the Internet,


300
0:11:59,2 --> 0:12:1,389
you and me
are gonna have a problem.


301
0:12:1,389 --> 0:12:9,725
Ah!


302
0:12:9,725 --> 0:12:11,116
Suzanne,
why aren't you dressed?


303
0:12:11,116 --> 0:12:12,55
We got to get going.


304
0:12:12,55 --> 0:12:14,819
I can't think of work
at a time like this.


305
0:12:14,819 --> 0:12:16,755
Because it's time
to go to work.


306
0:12:16,755 --> 0:12:18,89
Well, I'm not going to work.
I'm too embarrassed.


307
0:12:18,89 --> 0:12:20,91
Oh, gosh.


308
0:12:20,91 --> 0:12:21,859
Are you still worried
about the stupid video?


309
0:12:21,859 --> 0:12:24,28
Gigi, that stupid video
has over 5 million hits,


310
0:12:24,28 --> 0:12:26,363
and obviously somebody at work
recognized me,


311
0:12:26,363 --> 0:12:28,399
because my inbox
is filled of videos


312
0:12:28,399 --> 0:12:30,367
of me dancing
to <i>Baby Got Back.</i>


313
0:12:30,367 --> 0:12:33,202
I even got an email
from Sir Mix-a-Lot.


314
0:12:33,202 --> 0:12:34,87
Well, it could be worse.


315
0:12:34,87 --> 0:12:36,5
How?


316
0:12:36,5 --> 0:12:38,39
You could be dancing
to <i>Everybody Dance Now,</i>


317
0:12:38,39 --> 0:12:41,876
and lord knows you don't want
an email from Freedom Williams.


318
0:12:41,876 --> 0:12:44,211
Why do I keep falling
for that?


319
0:12:44,211 --> 0:12:45,512
Well, you know what?


320
0:12:45,512 --> 0:12:47,514
You don't have anything
to be embarrassed about.


321
0:12:47,514 --> 0:12:48,715
Look at all these cool comments.


322
0:12:48,715 --> 0:12:50,182
People think it's great,


323
0:12:50,182 --> 0:12:52,385
think it's fun.


324
0:12:52,385 --> 0:12:54,686
Ha!
You're making 'em laugh.


325
0:12:54,686 --> 0:12:55,886
Gigi, it's not funny.


326
0:12:55,886 --> 0:12:58,155
How would you feel
if this were a video of you?


327
0:12:58,155 --> 0:13:1,124
If this were a video of me,
I wouldn't be dancing,


328
0:13:1,124 --> 0:13:11,634
and there would be a whole
different set of comments.


329
0:13:11,634 --> 0:13:14,2
Okay.
I have Suzanne's video up.


330
0:13:14,2 --> 0:13:18,773
Okay, click play
and tell me what happens.


331
0:13:18,773 --> 0:13:20,74
Oh, wait a second.


332
0:13:20,74 --> 0:13:23,31
I got, like,
a billion pop-ups here.


333
0:13:23,31 --> 0:13:24,412
Well, as a matter of fact,


334
0:13:24,412 --> 0:13:26,13
I would like to meet singles
in my area.


335
0:13:26,13 --> 0:13:28,782
Thank you for asking.


336
0:13:28,782 --> 0:13:31,484
Okay, now the screen
just froze.


337
0:13:31,484 --> 0:13:33,85
Good.
It works.


338
0:13:33,85 --> 0:13:34,72
You wanted this to happen?


339
0:13:34,72 --> 0:13:36,154
I can't shut down
the Internet,


340
0:13:36,154 --> 0:13:38,23
but I can shut down
the people.


341
0:13:38,23 --> 0:13:39,858
If they try
to watch this video,


342
0:13:39,858 --> 0:13:41,626
it'll be the last thing
they watch.


343
0:13:41,626 --> 0:13:44,195
So you're willing to crash
20 million computers


344
0:13:44,195 --> 0:13:45,562
to save one marriage?


345
0:13:45,562 --> 0:13:53,27
Yes.
Yes, I am.


346
0:13:53,27 --> 0:13:55,473
Okay, now put
a little salt in it.


347
0:13:55,473 --> 0:13:57,908
Okay.


348
0:13:57,908 --> 0:14:1,511
Oh, baby, they haven't
taught you anything, have they?


349
0:14:1,511 --> 0:14:3,13
Excuse me.


350
0:14:3,13 --> 0:14:6,82
This is how you put
a little salt in it.


351
0:14:6,82 --> 0:14:8,684
Stir it up.
Okay.


352
0:14:8,684 --> 0:14:11,319
Mmm, that smells good.


353
0:14:11,319 --> 0:14:12,587
What are we having?


354
0:14:12,587 --> 0:14:15,22
Well, Lindsey is making
southern fried chicken,


355
0:14:15,22 --> 0:14:17,424
macaroni and cheese,
and collard greens.


356
0:14:17,424 --> 0:14:21,495
And Marilyn's teaching me
how to make pot liquor.


357
0:14:21,495 --> 0:14:24,53
Pot liquor.


358
0:14:24,53 --> 0:14:26,432
I hope she's also teaching you
how to make a cure


359
0:14:26,432 --> 0:14:28,33
for type 2 diabetes.


360
0:14:28,33 --> 0:14:29,568
Ha!


361
0:14:29,568 --> 0:14:31,636
Type 2 diabetes.


362
0:14:31,636 --> 0:14:33,838
I worry about that kid.


363
0:14:33,838 --> 0:14:35,939
For your information,
I also taught Lindsey


364
0:14:35,939 --> 0:14:37,674
how to make
my sweet potato pound cake.


365
0:14:37,674 --> 0:14:39,108
Of course,
you won't want any,


366
0:14:39,108 --> 0:14:41,243
because you're afraid
you might get type 2 diabetes.


367
0:14:41,243 --> 0:14:43,144
Pfft!


368
0:14:43,144 --> 0:14:47,681
Type 2.


369
0:14:47,681 --> 0:14:49,85
Type 2.
You're funny.


370
0:14:49,85 --> 0:14:51,51
Don't look at me.


371
0:14:51,51 --> 0:14:52,886
I don't know
what's wrong with him.


372
0:14:52,886 --> 0:14:54,621
You made
sweet potato pound cake?


373
0:14:54,621 --> 0:14:56,256
Yup,
with buttercream frosting.


374
0:14:56,256 --> 0:14:58,491
Oh, my goodness.


375
0:14:58,491 --> 0:14:59,559
See?


376
0:14:59,559 --> 0:15:1,761
I told you men can't resist
soul food.


377
0:15:1,761 --> 0:15:2,962
You were right.


378
0:15:2,962 --> 0:15:5,66
This pound cake gonna make
my blood pressure go up.


379
0:15:5,66 --> 0:15:6,0
Well, have one of these.


380
0:15:6,0 --> 0:15:7,468
It'll send it
right back down.


381
0:15:7,468 --> 0:15:10,304
Ha!


382
0:15:10,304 --> 0:15:19,581
Blood pressure!


383
0:15:19,581 --> 0:15:20,582
Great.


384
0:15:20,582 --> 0:15:22,283
Now my computer is frozen.


385
0:15:22,283 --> 0:15:24,418
Well, try hitting
the escape button.


386
0:15:24,418 --> 0:15:25,819
I tried that.
It didn't work.


387
0:15:25,819 --> 0:15:26,919
It's still frozen.


388
0:15:26,919 --> 0:15:28,586
Why do they even have
an escape button


389
0:15:28,586 --> 0:15:30,454
if it doesn't
help you escape?


390
0:15:30,454 --> 0:15:32,189
It feels more like a trap.


391
0:15:32,189 --> 0:15:33,257
Well, press the command key


392
0:15:33,257 --> 0:15:34,824
and start hitting
all the other keys.


393
0:15:34,824 --> 0:15:36,91
What does that do?


394
0:15:36,91 --> 0:15:38,858
I don't know,
but we're about to find out.


395
0:15:38,858 --> 0:15:40,892
Suzanne.


396
0:15:40,892 --> 0:15:43,16
I've solved your problem.


397
0:15:43,16 --> 0:15:44,561
Thank you, honey,


398
0:15:44,561 --> 0:15:46,463
but now I have
a new problem.


399
0:15:46,463 --> 0:15:49,833
I clicked on my video,
and my computer is frozen.


400
0:15:49,833 --> 0:15:52,603
That's not the problem.


401
0:15:52,603 --> 0:15:53,937
That's the solution.


402
0:15:53,937 --> 0:15:56,673
Just restart your computer,
and everything will be fine.


403
0:15:56,673 --> 0:15:58,474
I don't understand.


404
0:15:58,474 --> 0:16:1,51
I'm your man.


405
0:16:1,51 --> 0:16:3,245
You're responsible
for this.


406
0:16:3,245 --> 0:16:4,98
Yes, I am.


407
0:16:4,98 --> 0:16:7,182
I figured I couldn't stop
the video from circulating,


408
0:16:7,182 --> 0:16:8,983
so I attached a virus


409
0:16:8,983 --> 0:16:11,285
to the keywords
associated to the video.


410
0:16:11,285 --> 0:16:15,154
Now people will stay away
from your video like the plague.


411
0:16:15,154 --> 0:16:16,989
I have my own virus.


412
0:16:16,989 --> 0:16:18,423
Yes, you do.


413
0:16:18,423 --> 0:16:22,693
Oh, my God.
That is so romantic.


414
0:16:22,693 --> 0:16:24,261
I want a virus.


415
0:16:24,261 --> 0:16:27,43
Give it time.


416
0:16:27,43 --> 0:16:28,864
Nick.


417
0:16:28,864 --> 0:16:35,47
Come on.
She'll get one.


418
0:16:35,47 --> 0:16:39,205
Dad gave you a virus.
That's awesome.


419
0:16:39,205 --> 0:16:40,84
Yes, it is awesome,


420
0:16:40,84 --> 0:16:43,309
but what wasn't awesome was you
leaving your webcam running


421
0:16:43,309 --> 0:16:45,144
so Troy could record me.


422
0:16:45,144 --> 0:16:46,978
I know.


423
0:16:46,978 --> 0:16:48,713
I'm sorry.


424
0:16:48,713 --> 0:16:50,848
It's okay.
Apology accepted.


425
0:16:50,848 --> 0:16:52,516
Here's your computer back.


426
0:16:52,516 --> 0:16:54,451
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.


427
0:16:54,451 --> 0:16:59,822
Mom, have you seen
the lotion?


428
0:16:59,822 --> 0:17:1,524
Produce some ashy elbows,


429
0:17:1,524 --> 0:17:11,866
and then maybe you can have
the lotion back.


430
0:17:11,866 --> 0:17:14,568
Sweetheart,
this is delicious.


431
0:17:14,568 --> 0:17:16,137
You did a fantastic job.


432
0:17:16,137 --> 0:17:17,405
Thank you.


433
0:17:17,405 --> 0:17:19,407
I'm gonna have use
my bullworker for five hours


434
0:17:19,407 --> 0:17:21,442
to burn off
all these calories.


435
0:17:21,442 --> 0:17:22,409
Pass the gravy.


436
0:17:22,409 --> 0:17:25,545
I love gravy.
I love gravy too.


437
0:17:25,545 --> 0:17:27,179
Gravy goes with everything:


438
0:17:27,179 --> 0:17:29,147
Chicken, biscuits,
mashed potatoes.


439
0:17:29,147 --> 0:17:31,683
Gravy even tastes good
with gravy.


440
0:17:31,683 --> 0:17:34,352
This gravy's so good,
you don't need the food.


441
0:17:34,352 --> 0:17:36,587
I gained three pounds
just smelling it.


442
0:17:36,587 --> 0:17:38,456
I'm gonna have to dance
like you in that video


443
0:17:38,456 --> 0:17:40,557
to burn it off.


444
0:17:40,557 --> 0:17:42,792
You know,
now that I think about it,


445
0:17:42,792 --> 0:17:44,93
the video was kind of funny.


446
0:17:44,93 --> 0:17:45,862
Plus, it all worked out
in my favor.


447
0:17:45,862 --> 0:17:48,797
It was so popular, I actually
gained clients from it.


448
0:17:48,797 --> 0:17:49,765
Wow.


449
0:17:49,765 --> 0:17:51,166
See, that's great.


450
0:17:51,166 --> 0:17:54,101
Everything worked out
for the best.


451
0:17:54,101 --> 0:17:56,636
Ooh, I haven't ate like this
in years.


452
0:17:56,636 --> 0:17:58,271
You used to eat like this?


453
0:17:58,271 --> 0:18:0,272
Sure, every day
when I played football.


454
0:18:0,272 --> 0:18:1,607
You didn't get to be
300 pounds


455
0:18:1,607 --> 0:18:6,11
by eating flavorless, skinless,
stress-free chicken.


456
0:18:6,11 --> 0:18:8,13
You know, as much as I hate
to admit it,


457
0:18:8,13 --> 0:18:13,751
this is just like
a Sunday dinner.


458
0:18:13,751 --> 0:18:14,718
Mmm. Mmm.


459
0:18:14,718 --> 0:18:16,719
Wow.
That's really good.


460
0:18:16,719 --> 0:18:25,771
Mm-hmm.
Oh, my goodness.

reports are spreading
of a crippling new computer bug


469
0:18:42,85 --> 0:18:45,618
experts have dubbed
"the dancing housewife virus."


470
0:18:45,618 --> 0:18:48,454
Apparently, when you click
on this viral video


471
0:18:48,454 --> 0:18:49,688
of a woman dancing


472
0:18:49,688 --> 0:18:52,457
to Sir Mix-a-Lot's hit
<i>Baby Got Back,</i>


473
0:18:52,457 --> 0:18:54,192
it freezes your computer,


474
0:18:54,192 --> 0:18:56,427
sends you
countless pop-up ads,


475
0:18:56,427 --> 0:18:58,861
and, in some extreme cases,


476
0:18:58,861 --> 0:19:23,181
wipes out
your entire hard drive.


477
0:19:23,181 --> 0:19:29,986
Ew.


478
0:19:29,986 --> 0:19:32,221
What time is it?


479
0:19:32,221 --> 0:19:34,923
It's Thursday.


480
0:19:34,923 --> 0:19:36,658
Oh, I forgot to warn
you guys.


481
0:19:36,658 --> 0:19:38,926
It's one of the side effects
of eating soul food.


482
0:19:38,926 --> 0:19:40,86
It's been known
to put you to sleep.


483
0:19:40,86 --> 0:19:44,761
For a day and a half?


484
0:19:44,761 --> 0:19:46,728
Ooh, my ears keep ringing.


485
0:19:46,728 --> 0:19:49,229
That's not your ears.
That's the doorbell.


486
0:19:49,229 --> 0:19:50,563
Oh.


487
0:19:50,563 --> 0:19:52,33
Coming.


488
0:19:52,33 --> 0:19:54,731
Ooh.
Ooh.


489
0:19:54,731 --> 0:19:58,932
Coming.


490
0:19:58,932 --> 0:20:6,38
Ow, my leg.


491
0:20:6,38 --> 0:20:7,573
Hi, Mrs. Kingston-Persons.


492
0:20:7,573 --> 0:20:9,274
Hi, Mr. Kingston-Persons.


493
0:20:9,274 --> 0:20:11,609
Hi, Troy.


494
0:20:11,609 --> 0:20:13,944
You guys have cake?


495
0:20:13,944 --> 0:20:16,347
In the kitchen.


496
0:20:16,347 --> 0:20:18,148
What can we do for you,
Jackie?


497
0:20:18,148 --> 0:20:20,519
The dancing housewife virus
crashed my computer.


498
0:20:20,519 --> 0:20:21,621
I need you to fix it.


499
0:20:21,621 --> 0:20:23,19
What does that have to do
with me?


500
0:20:23,19 --> 0:20:25,759
Well, if your wife hadn't been
prancing around on the Internet,


501
0:20:25,759 --> 0:20:28,795
none of this
would have happened.


502
0:20:28,795 --> 0:20:30,564
If you knew
there was a virus, Jackie,


503
0:20:30,564 --> 0:20:34,367
why would you click
on the video?


504
0:20:34,367 --> 0:20:44,529
I was trying to figure out
how you did it.


505
0:20:44,529 --> 0:20:47,932
Is she still doing it, Nick?


506
0:20:47,932 --> 0:20:49,862
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.


507
0:20:49,862 --> 0:20:51,772
Maybe you could show me.


508
0:20:51,772 --> 0:20:53,437
Want some cake?


509
0:20:53,437 --> 0:20:57,535
We got some, uh,
sweet potato pound cake.


510
0:20:57,535 --> 0:20:59,835
Let me fix it.
Let me fix it.
