###16 PAT DUFFY: Yeah, man, a long-ass time ago I guess Gonz
###21 was doing an interview at Thrasher.
###22 And he was like--
###23 they were like, who do you think's good?
###24 And he's like well, I don't know.
###26 He's like, too bad Duffy doesn't skate anymore, 'cause
###29 he used to be good.
###30 
###32 This was a long time ago, too, when I was
###34 totally still skating.
###37 And then he goes, you know what he should do?
###39 He should get on a board like this.
###40 I'm gonna leave it here.
###41 And then I just happened to be at Thrasher, and Jake's like,
###44 hey, Mark left this for you.
###47 Take it.
###49 I was like, really?
###49 That's really strange.
###52 I was so psyched though.
###53 I went and shot an ad on it and stuff for playback.
###56 MALE SPEAKER 1: Who owns the footage of you trying the--
###59 where you hurt your knee?
###60 PAT DUFFY: I have that right here.
###62 I have one right here on my iPod.
###64 It was already used on that fucking stupid MTV show.
###67 
###81 [GROAN]
###83 It sucks.
###85 Ouch, that hurt.
###87 I worked out today man.
###89 It's coming back.
###91 It's getting real strong man.
###93 I'm so psyched.
###94 I'm so embarrassed that I did that show.
###97 There was like roller bladers on my episode and shit.
###99 Like, I told them I've done this for a
###102 career for 15 years.
###103 Don't lump me in with some kid from Bakersfield who is a
###106 backyard wrestler for fun.
###110 Forget it, dude.
###112 PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, welcome back to the show.
###114 This episode is about Pat Duffy.
###116 I just remember when "Questionable" came out.
###118 I had never heard of him.
###119 Nobody had ever heard of him, and his part was one of the
###123 best skate parts in years.
###125 Pat was probably the first hand rail pro.
###129 He was doing things that people
###130 didn't think were possible.
###131 Plan B was created as kind of a super team to have the best
###135 people from every genre of skateboarding.
###139 I think Mike Ternasky set this template, this Plan B formula,
###144 that I see a lot of companies now like Zero and Baker.
###147 You can see it all took Plan B's lead.
###150 SAL BARBIER: The first time I heard about Pat Duffy was,
###154 man, that was a long time ago.
###157 Ternasky, Mike Ternasky, was talking about this new guy
###162 that he had found that lived in Marin County.
###166 He was coming out, and he was filming, and he was doing a
###169 lot of really impressive things.
###171 So we knew that he was going to be a
###174 professional right away.
###176 PAT DUFFY: I had flown down just to see if I would fit in
###179 on the team, you know?
###180 Whatever.
###181 
###185 Yeah.
###186 Well, Carroll I knew already because I had-- you remember
###189 in "Hokus Pokus" the Hensley balance beam that they used to
###192 skate at School W?
###193 I had one of those, a portable one.
###195 So people used to come skate that thing from everywhere.
###198 Carroll brothers would come skate, Danny Sargent, Henry,
###202 and then I had a ramp in my yard too.
###205 So I'd known those dudes, you know?
###209 But it was intimidating to go hang out with Danny Way.
###213 I was like 17 years old.
###215 My point of view coming from watching him and Colin in
###220 videos growing up.
###223 And then NT just going, hey you're
###224 staying at Danny's house.
###225 Go with him.
###226 And I'm just like all right, OK, whatever.
###231 -I can't do it.
###232 I can't do it.
###233 
###235 Ow, fuck!
###237 
###240 Fuck, I'm bleeding.
###242 There's blood.
###243 Let me give you the theory of Pat, Taylor.
###245 You see Pat, Pat is actually a terminator.
###247 
###252 PAT DUFFY: We filmed for like three weeks every day.
###254 They were just staying at my house when I went
###255 to school and shit.
###257 MALE SPEAKER 1: Where was that school yard with the big rail?
###259 PAT DUFFY: That was at San Pasqual in San Diego.
###262 MALE SPEAKER 1: You did it twice?
###263 PAT DUFFY: Yeah, twice.
###264 MALE SPEAKER 1: Why'd you do it twice?
###266 PAT DUFFY: Think we were thinking different angle.
###267 And I was like, sure.
###268 You know, one from the top one from the bottom.
###270 We didn't have two cameras.
###272 It was just Mike filming.
###274 MALE SPEAKER 1: But I remember at the time when that came out
###275 too, thinking that you couldn't grind a round bar.
###278 What made you think you could grind a round bar?
###281 PAT DUFFY: Because, I don't know, I had that balance beam
###282 growing up.
###283 I just got comfortable grinding
###286 metal rails, you know?
###288 I don't know.
###288 I just liked doing that at the time.
###291 Just kind of scaring myself.
###293 I literally lost my mind back smithing that
###297 kinked rail at SF State.
###299 Because I knew I could do it and I just wasn't doing it.
###302 MALE SPEAKER 1: Did you know that the Plan B video would be
###306 as big of a deal as it was?
###307 PAT DUFFY: I mean, I don't really.
###308 I mean, of course you knew it was because you knew it was
###311 going to be something crazy.
###313 Because we would see the footage going down and there
###315 was nothing.
###316 You know, Ternasky made it a point that we knew what
###320 everyone else was doing.
###321 So that we could feed off of it, you know?
###322 He'd always call every day and be like, yep Rick did this.
###327 Carroll, got this.
###328 And you'd just get so psyched.
###331 He's one of my favorite skaters of all time.
###334 I would rather watch fucking Carroll do a back T on a ledge
###338 than some dude jump down a 30 stair trying to kick flip it.
###344 His whole style is like so sick.
###347 JAKE ROSENBERG: I mean, when I started working for Plan B,
###348 Pat's part was already done.
###350 That was kind of how it was set up, you know?
###353 Which I think Mike strategically did to get
###355 everyone fired up for the video.
###357 To have this amazing part and then have everyone doing their
###360 own part after that.
###361 And you know, imagine being Mike Carroll and coming down
###364 to this new company, Plan B, and see Pat Duffy's part.
###367 And having Mike put your arm around and say, you're my top
###370 street pro.
###371 Come on!
###372 How could you be super stoked?
###374 It's like, fuck.
###376 MIKE CARROLL: I mean when we first got Plan B started, it
###379 was like this whole awesome thing.
###382 And then it seemed like there's a little bit of--
###385 not tension, but--
###388 I don't know.
###389 Just people had different ideas.
###393 You know?
###394 Like all of a sudden, it's like I have to learn a trick.
###397 Not like ah, it'd be cool to learn a trick.
###400 JAKE ROSENBERG: So Mike and I were doing this voice-over for
###405 this project.
###406 He's like, dude do you have that old first version of
###409 "Questionable" with Gonz in it?
###411 I was like, what are you talking about?
###412 He's like remember?
###413 He was at the Pal contest, and we had the trick of him.
###416 And he called Mike Ternasky and told him to take it out?
###419 And I was like, what?
###420 Gonz did that?
###422 And then I vividly remembered Mike being really bummed.
###427 You know?
###428 Because I think that just the way that Mike approached
###431 skateboarding, a lot of
###433 skateboarders didn't like that.
###435 But I know, that in his heart, he loved skateboarding.
###439 So I think it's kind of heartbreaking when you think
###441 you're doing something for the better good of something and
###445 someone else doesn't.
###446 
###449 Mike did amazing things while he was alive.
###453 I'm not just saying that because he's dead.
###456 MALE SPEAKER 2 (OFFSCREEN): Get down, boy.
###457 PAT DUFFY (OFFSCREEN) Thanks, bro.
###458 -You know I could have did better man.
###459 -I believe you.
###460 -That was tough.
###460 Man, I like that.
###461 What kind of wheels you got?
###462 -Little one--
###463 MALE SPEAKER 3 (OFFSCREEN): What do you got
###463 to say about that?
###464 -The only thing I got to say is look here.
###468 The guy's a natural.
###469 He's a natural.
###470 And you know something?
###471 When you want to make a million dollars, hey, you come
###472 and look for me.
###474 You look for the baby, because the baby knows a natural.
###477 Hey, come on, hold it up there.
###480 Show them who's number one.
###481 Show them who's number one.
###483 -That was great man.
###484 That was great.
###485 That was great.
###486 I especially liked the flip of the board.
###490 That was cool.
###491 I can't jump that high.
###493 My vertical leap is only about an inch, if that high.
###496 MALE SPEAKER 3 (OFFSCREEN) Take it easy.
###497 MALE SPEAKER 4 (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, right on, man.
###497 Have a good trip now.
###499 PAT DUFFY: What's that?
###499 MALE SPEAKER 1: It seemed like those two, "Virtual Reality"
###502 came out almost-- to me it seemed like immediately.
###504 I guess it was a year later?
###505 PAT DUFFY: It was a year later, yeah.
###507 MALE SPEAKER 1: That's pretty fast now.
###508 PAT DUFFY: For now a days, people sit on them for a
###510 couple years now.
###512 It was different.
###513 It was just a different vibe back then though, because no
###516 one really made any money.
###517 It was like you were still kind of--
###519 you were still just like skating all the time.
###523 There was a while white rail lip slide that went down flat.
###527 That took a couple times because I kept sticking on it
###529 and I had to set up a slick bottom.
###531 Jake Rosenberg filmed that one.
###533 JAKE ROSENBERG: I mean, Pat's fucking first video part's one
###535 of the greatest video parts in the history of skateboarding.
###537 And it's like, who the fuck is this kid?
###539 I've never seen it before.
###541 And he didn't exactly have a sophomore jinx.
###543 I mean, I think his "Virtual Reality" part is equally as
###545 impressive.
###546 MALE SPEAKER 1: When a lot of those guys left to do their
###549 own, did you take that personally?
###551 PAT DUFFY: No, I didn't take it personally at all.
###553 I figured they had their reasons.
###557 JAKE ROSENBERG: You know what, that's what Mike
###558 Carroll told me.
###559 And this, I think we have to explore at another time.
###562 But he was like, we knew we were leaving the company long
###567 before we did.
###569 And that's why we had the Friends section.
###571 It's because we knew there was never going to
###573 be a "Blind" video.
###574 PAT DUFFY: But I did get a call from Rick saying, this is
###576 what we're doing.
###576 And we want you to know that this is what we're doing.
###581 And then you can make a decision on your own what
###585 you're going to do.
###586 Which I thought was pretty cool of them just to let me
###589 know what was happening that day.
###592 Like the day they showed up with all the "Girl"
###594 shirts on, you know.
###596 MIKE CARROLL: The way we did it was crazy but--
###597 MALE SPEAKER 1: Just all at once take half the team.
###600 MIKE CARROLL: Yeah, and not tell anyone and didn't give
###603 any notice or anything.
###604 But if you know how powerful World or Rocco or any of those
###608 dudes were back then?
###610 If we tried to let them know, we would never have even
###614 existed because they would have never let it happen.
###619 PAT DUFFY: Just because that happened didn't really faze me
###621 on turning my back on MT.
###623 Just because he kind of took me in as one of those kids.
###630 JAKE ROSENBERG: He looked at all those guys like his kids.
###632 Again, regardless of how he did business and regardless of
###636 how people saw him in a certain capacity.
###640 He cared tremendously for everyone who skated for him.
###644 And I think he took pride in giving them an opportunity, or
###647 promoting them, to be great skaters.
###650 So Mike died May 17th, 1994.
###654 I went down to San Diego for the funeral.
###656 I remember seeing Danny outside the funeral home where
###658 they were having the viewing for Mike.
###660 Which was like the worst idea to go there.
###663 But Danny was just crying.
###666 And like, Danny was crying because he was devastated.
###669 PAT DUFFY: I don't know, he was just kind of like a second
###671 dad for me.
###673 I just appreciated everything he taught me.
###676 MALE SPEAKER 1: And so then when Plan B ended did you know
###678 where you were going to go after that?
###681 PAT DUFFY: No.
###684 MALE SPEAKER 1: These are all think boards?
###685 PAT DUFFY: Yeah, I was going through them the other day and
###688 I was like, damn, man I must have been raging when I lived
###691 in San Francisco.
###693 They're all booze graphics.
###696 All of them.
###697 It's crazy.
###698 Gabe Morford and I grew up together, you know.
###702 I was hanging out with Gabe, and he was going out with this
###705 full deluxe staff.
###707 So he was going out with everybody.
###709 I don't know.
###710 I was back in San Francisco, you know?
###714 And I was just hanging out with skateboarders again.
###716 
###719 JAKE ROSENBERG: You know, 14 years later or whatever, I
###721 look back on that time now.
###723 And I'm like, holy shit.
###723 I was involved, in my opinion, in like some of the greatest
###727 videos in the history of skating.
###728 When skateboarding was dead, Plan B reinvigorated it.
###733 Whether it caused people to revolt against it or it caused
###736 people to do more technical better tricks, Plan B was at
###741 the epicenter of what changed skateboarding.
###742
