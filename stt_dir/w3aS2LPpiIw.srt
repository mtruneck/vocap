show up in Mexico not knowing


18

anything about it, so we stopped
off in North Austin,

this, that, and the other.

to hear them talk


158
0:8:47,31 --> 0:8:49,71
about Caro Quintero, who in
the '80s was one of the


159
0:8:49,71 --> 0:8:52,68
biggest drug dealers in Mexico,
if not the world.


160
0:8:52,68 --> 0:8:55,43
In fact, he was so big that
when they caught him, he


161
0:8:55,43 --> 0:8:58,85
offered to pay off the sum total
of Mexicans' foreign


162
0:8:58,85 --> 0:9:0,635
debt if they let him go.


163
0:9:0,635 --> 0:9:3,76
They didn't let him go, and
he's still in jail.


164
0:9:3,76 --> 0:9:5,66
Caro Quintero's a perfect
example of the dichotomy that


165
0:9:5,66 --> 0:9:6,74
is narco cinema.


166
0:9:6,74 --> 0:9:8,75
Because on one side, they're
making movies about him and


167
0:9:8,75 --> 0:9:9,71
celebrating him.


168
0:9:9,71 --> 0:9:12,33
On the other hand, he's a
criminal who actually killed


169
0:9:12,33 --> 0:9:15,6
DEA agents and police
and everybody else.


170
0:9:15,6 --> 0:9:18,54
And today, that's really
evident, because the drug wars


171
0:9:18,54 --> 0:9:19,48
that are going on
there, the narco


172
0:9:19,48 --> 0:9:20,91
wars, are out of control.


173
0:9:20,91 --> 0:9:23,49
I mean, when we were down there
in Mexico, every day on


174
0:9:23,49 --> 0:9:26,11

tortures and beheadings and


175
0:9:26,11 --> 0:9:27,93
killings and corruption.


176
0:9:27,93 --> 0:9:31,14
So not only are the cartels now
warring with each other,


177
0:9:31,14 --> 0:9:33,9
there's a new government in that
is trying to fight the


178
0:9:33,9 --> 0:9:34,415
corruption within its
own government.


179
0:9:34,415 --> 0:9:36,42
This started sort of
more violence.


180
0:9:36,42 --> 0:9:38,47
The cartels were fighting the
government, the government


181
0:9:38,47 --> 0:9:39,86
were fighting the cartels,
the cartels were


182
0:9:39,86 --> 0:9:41,2
fighting each other.


183

0:9:43,14 --> 0:9:45,7
worse and worse and worse.

year for violent crime in

of mirrored what was going
on in American cinema.

0:10:29,66 --> 0:10:32,24
And along with the wrestling
science fiction movies, there


201
0:10:32,24 --> 0:10:35,245
were the sexy comedies, which
were kind of ribald romps


202

through the dancing whorehouses
of Mexico.


203

And then in the '80s, there
was a split between new


204
0:10:40,32 --> 0:10:41,56
Mexican cinema--


205
0:10:41,56 --> 0:10:45,1
"Like Water for Chocolate," for
example, and videohome or


206
0:10:45,1 --> 0:10:48,28

increasingly about action,

In fact, narco cinema's probably
watched by more

status-quo filmmaking that

everybody knows, like "Y Tu

its two-year-long shoots


394
0:21:3,45 --> 0:21:5,92
and its $100-million budgets
and its special


395
0:21:5,92 --> 0:21:7,42
effects and its CGI.


396
0:21:7,42 --> 0:21:9,68
You can go out and shoot a film
in two weeks, and it kind


397
0:21:9,68 --> 0:21:10,767
of looks great.

[GUNSHOT]


399
0:21:11,96 --> 0:21:14,27
SHANE SMITH: So they took us to
a garbage dump in 40-degree


400
0:21:14,27 --> 0:21:16,53
heat, in one of the poorest
neighborhoods of Tijuana,


401
0:21:16,53 --> 0:21:18,22
where I waited all
day to get shot.


402
0:21:18,22 --> 0:21:20,34
And just as my scene was coming
up, the director comes


403
0:21:20,34 --> 0:21:22,1
and says, Shane, Shane, we have
to go, we have to go.


404
0:21:22,1 --> 0:21:23,83
We have to get to
the whorehouse.


405
0:21:23,83 --> 0:21:25,64
So they take us to the cathouse,
but they haven't


406
0:21:25,64 --> 0:21:27,4
hired any actresses to
play the whores.


407
0:21:27,4 --> 0:21:28,6
No problem.


408
0:21:28,6 --> 0:21:29,57
They just go inside,
say, hey, come out.


409
0:21:29,57 --> 0:21:30,37
You want to be in a movie?


410
0:21:30,37 --> 0:21:33,44
Give them $100 or whatever,
we start shooting.

SHANE SMITH: Hi.


413
0:21:37,36 --> 0:21:39,97
Shane.


414
0:21:39,97 --> 0:21:43,42
SHANE SMITH: [SPEAKING SPANISH]


415
0:21:43,42 --> 0:21:44,89
SHANE SMITH: Actually, being in
the film was quite funny,


416
0:21:44,89 --> 0:21:46,105
because they move so fast.


417
0:21:46,105 --> 0:21:47,69
It's just like, you're
an American cowboy.


418
0:21:47,69 --> 0:21:48,39
You're pissed off.


419
0:21:48,39 --> 0:21:49,8
You come out of here.


420
0:21:49,8 --> 0:21:50,88
Do it on three, go.


421
0:21:50,88 --> 0:21:52,45
And you kind of feel
like Brando.


422
0:21:52,45 --> 0:21:53,84
You're like, well, what's
my emotion?


423
0:21:53,84 --> 0:21:54,68
What's my range?


424
0:21:54,68 --> 0:21:56,4
What's my motivation?


425
0:21:56,4 --> 0:21:58,26
But actually, you don't know
what the hell you're doing,


426
0:21:58,26 --> 0:22:0,17
and you're just trying to hit
your mark on time while the


427
0:22:0,17 --> 0:22:1,935
guns hit your face.

SHANE SMITH: Hey!


431
0:22:10,6 --> 0:22:11,362
What the fuck is going--

-[SPEAKING SPANISH]


433
0:22:12,82 --> 0:22:17,68
SHANE SMITH: Whoa, whoa, no
problemo, no problemo, man.


434
0:22:17,68 --> 0:22:19,41
By the time the guns get out of
your face and you're out of


435
0:22:19,41 --> 0:22:22,83
the scene, you're like, whew,
glad we got through that.


436
0:22:22,83 --> 0:22:26,13
Didn't show my acting skills
very much, but it was a hell


437
0:22:26,13 --> 0:22:27,8
of a lot of fun.


438
0:22:27,8 --> 0:22:27,77
ENRIQUE MURILLO: Thank you.


439
0:22:27,77 --> 0:22:28,15
SHANE SMITH: Thanks, buddy.


440
0:22:28,15 --> 0:22:28,9
ENRIQUE MURILLO: Thank
you, my friend.


441
0:22:28,9 --> 0:22:29,26
It's a pleasure.


442
0:22:29,26 --> 0:22:30,1
My pleasure.


443
0:22:30,1 --> 0:22:31,14
SHANE SMITH: It's my pleasure.


444
0:22:31,14 --> 0:22:32,36
Thank you very much.


445
0:22:32,36 --> 0:22:33,25
ENRIQUE MURILLO:
OK, thank you.


446
0:22:33,25 --> 0:22:36,946
SHANE SMITH: So that's our
narco cinema wrapped.


447
0:22:36,946 --> 0:22:39,74
We gotta go back to
the States now.


448
0:22:39,74 --> 0:22:42,79
So we had a lot of fun making
the narco cinema film.


449
0:22:42,79 --> 0:22:45,94
But on the flight back, we read
that 40 people had been


450
0:22:45,94 --> 0:22:48,2
killed in Tijuana that
week alone, and it


451
0:22:48,2 --> 0:22:49,31
kind of sobered us.


452
0:22:49,31 --> 0:22:52,4
And we thought, well, as long
as there's a huge demand for


453
0:22:52,4 --> 0:22:56,31
drugs in America, there's going
to be blood, drugs, and


454
0:22:56,31 --> 0:22:59,33
these kind of movies flowing
out of Mexico.
