BASIM USMANI: While we were
filming in Karachi, our shoot


6
0:0:23,0 --> 0:0:25,24
took one dark turn
after another.


7
0:0:25,24 --> 0:0:28,36
Things just got heavier
and heavier.


8
0:0:28,36 --> 0:0:30,68
But we met one person in the
midst of all this chaos that


9
0:0:30,68 --> 0:0:32,509
gave us hope.


10
0:0:32,509 --> 0:0:34,48
His name is Abdul Sattar Edhi.


11
0:0:34,48 --> 0:0:37,145
And he is to Karachi what Mother
Teresa was to the poor


12
0:0:37,145 --> 0:0:38,64
of Calcutta.


13
0:0:38,64 --> 0:0:41,22
As the founder of the Edhi
Foundation, the largest


14
0:0:41,22 --> 0:0:44,58
welfare organization in
Pakistan, he's opened over 300


15
0:0:44,58 --> 0:0:47,23
centers across the country,
run by more than 3,500


16
0:0:47,23 --> 0:0:50,45
workers, plus thousands of
volunteers, providing medical


17
0:0:50,45 --> 0:0:54,2
aid, family planning, and
emergency assistance.


18
0:0:54,2 --> 0:0:56,85
The Edhi Foundation has also
made donations towards


19
0:0:56,85 --> 0:0:59,69
disaster relief around the
world, including to victims of


20
0:0:59,69 --> 0:1:2,1
Hurricane Katrina in the US.


21
0:1:2,1 --> 0:1:4,81
They rely entirely on donations,
and avoid political


22
0:1:4,81 --> 0:1:7,79
or religious affiliation.


23
0:1:7,79 --> 0:1:11,82
We got a chance to meet with
this living legend in Karachi.


24
0:1:11,82 --> 0:1:13,6
Edhi is one of the
most important


25
0:1:13,6 --> 0:1:14,75
public figures in Pakistan.


26
0:1:14,75 --> 0:1:16,65
But recently there were reports
that he was being


27
0:1:16,65 --> 0:1:18,52
targeted by the Taliban.


28
0:1:18,52 --> 0:1:21,93
So now, against his own wishes,
he has round the clock


29
0:1:21,93 --> 0:1:23,306
police security.
