Why ? I don't understand.
Is it something I've done ?


2
0:0:5,72 --> 0:0:8,88
Look, it's just not gonna work, OK ?


3
0:0:8,88 --> 0:0:11,68
Five years, you know ? Five years !


4
0:0:11,68 --> 0:0:13,8
I... I was drunk.


5
0:0:13,8 --> 0:0:18,24
Oh, we had fun ! You know ?
We had good times.


6
0:0:18,24 --> 0:0:21,72
To be honest, I don't...
remember much about it.


7
0:0:21,72 --> 0:0:24,4
I don't und... Just... Eugh !


8
0:0:24,4 --> 0:0:25,84
Give me a reason ! You know ?


9
0:0:25,84 --> 0:0:28,76
You think I'm unemotional, don't you ?
I can be emotional.


10
0:0:28,76 --> 0:0:32,28
 Jesus, I cried like a child
at the end of Terminator 2, 


11
0:0:32,28 --> 0:0:35,8
With the thumb and the molten...
You know ?


12
0:0:35,8 --> 0:0:36,6
Is there someone else ?


13
0:0:36,6 --> 0:0:38,44
- Sort of.
- Don't... What !


14
0:0:38,44 --> 0:0:39,8
My boyfriend.


15
0:0:39,8 --> 0:0:44,28
- That bastard ! I bloody knew it !
- I'm sorry, I really am.


16
0:0:44,28 --> 0:0:46,56
It was just a bit of fun, you know ?


17
0:0:46,56 --> 0:0:51,0
It just doesn't feel right. OK ?


18
0:0:51,0 --> 0:0:52,88
- Fine.
- All right ?


19
0:0:52,88 --> 0:0:55,8
Fine.


20
0:0:55,8 --> 0:1:0,16
Look, there's a bit of change.


21
0:1:0,16 --> 0:1:2,8
Sarah, please ! Don't do this !


22
0:1:2,8 --> 0:1:5,48
You can leave your stuff here
until you find somewhere else.


23
0:1:5,48 --> 0:1:20,64
- I love you !

0:1:34,8 --> 0:1:37,6
Excuse me. Excuse me !
Mind if I sit here ?


26
0:1:37,6 --> 0:1:44,8
- Er, no, no.
- OK. Thanks.


27
0:1:44,8 --> 0:1:47,44
What you looking for ?


28
0:1:47,44 --> 0:1:49,48
What have you got ?


29
0:1:49,48 --> 0:1:51,36
Hm ?


30
0:1:51,36 --> 0:1:54,96
What have you got ?


31
0:1:54,96 --> 0:1:58,0
- No, I mean what are you looking for ?


32
0:1:58,0 --> 0:2:1,0
Sorry,
I thought you were a drug dealer.


33
0:2:1,0 --> 0:2:3,28
- Oh, thanks.
- That's all right.


34
0:2:3,28 --> 0:2:6,12
- No, I'm flat hunting.
- Oh, right.


35
0:2:6,12 --> 0:2:8,0
Yeah. Oh !


36
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:12,72
I was staying with these mates,
well, people I'd met in a squat,


37
0:2:12,72 --> 0:2:17,56
 I didn't meet them in a squat, I moved
into a squat with them, which was fine... 


38
0:2:17,56 --> 0:2:19,36
Are you interested ? Anyway,


39
0:2:19,36 --> 0:2:23,2
there was this guy,
and I didn't really know, well...


40
0:2:23,2 --> 0:2:26,76
I suppose... no.
Really what happened was...


41
0:2:26,76 --> 0:2:31,16
- No, rather than confront, I thought...
- Skip to the end.


42
0:2:31,16 --> 0:2:33,12
So, I'm moving out.


43
0:2:33,12 --> 0:2:34,96
I see.


44
0:2:34,96 --> 0:2:43,24
I hate flat-hunting. Yeah.
I do not envy you at all.


45
0:2:43,24 --> 0:2:53,0
- Could I borrow that after you ?
- Yeah.


46
0:2:53,0 --> 0:2:57,4
- Do you mind if I sit here ?
- Oh, no.


47
0:2:57,4 --> 0:3:2,84
- Any luck ?
- No. It's early days yet, so...

 Getting to know all about you 


51

 Getting to like you 


52
0:3:15,76 --> 0:3:18,8
 Getting to hope you'll like me 


53
0:3:18,8 --> 0:3:20,84

- Hi.


54
0:3:20,84 --> 0:3:22,96

- Oh, same as always.


55

0:3:52,68 --> 0:3:55,68
Now... whoa, there, Pickle.


59
0:3:55,68 --> 0:3:58,72
Every morning I wake up and it's the same.


60
0:3:58,72 --> 0:4:3,56
I buy the paper
and I circle them all and I phone them,


61
0:4:3,56 --> 0:4:9,52
only to discover they've been taken by
a bunch of fucking psychic house-hunters !


62
0:4:9,52 --> 0:4:15,48
- You've only looked at a few.
- They've all been cold, infested rat holes.


63

I'm in the same boat,
you don't see me cry...


64

Why ? ! Why ? ! Why ? !


68
0:4:45,88 --> 0:4:49,56
- You could always pretend.
- What do you mean ?


69
0:4:49,56 --> 0:4:55,68
Well, have you got
any homeless male friends ?


70
0:4:55,68 --> 0:5:1,56
Well,
I do have one homeless male friend.


71
0:5:1,56 --> 0:5:6,28
Who ?


72
0:5:6,28 --> 0:5:11,76
OK. You were born in Highgate to John
and Gillian Bisley on 17th September, 1974.


73
0:5:11,76 --> 0:5:12,8
Right.


74
0:5:12,8 --> 0:5:18,84
Your little sister Katie once used all your
Batman comics to decorate a cardboard car.


75
0:5:18,84 --> 0:5:21,92
Unable to salvage the comics,
you drove the car into a pond,


76
0:5:21,92 --> 0:5:24,68
hit your head on the fountain,
which is where you got your scar.


77
0:5:24,68 --> 0:5:28,52
You've got a best friend called Mike
who's a weapons expert.


78
0:5:28,52 --> 0:5:29,88
- Yes !


79
0:5:29,88 --> 0:5:31,32
Er... yeah.


80
0:5:31,32 --> 0:5:34,84
You have a potentially fatal allergy
to brazil nuts.


81
0:5:34,84 --> 0:5:37,84
I have no memory of Christmas 1979.


82
0:5:37,84 --> 0:5:40,24
I've got no memory of Christmas 1994 either.


83
0:5:40,24 --> 0:5:43,44
- Oh, why not ?
- I don't know.


84
0:5:43,44 --> 0:5:47,4
You're an aspiring graphic artist
and you hope one day to work for... ?


85
0:5:47,4 --> 0:5:48,92
- Dark Star Comics.
- Dark Star Comics.


86
0:5:48,92 --> 0:5:53,56
Work to date includes a sleeve design
for your sister's boyfriend's brother's band.


87
0:5:53,56 --> 0:6:0,2
You supplement the 50 quid you got from that
by working in a comic shop, Fantasy Bazaar.


88
0:6:0,2 --> 0:6:2,52
I'm the assistant manager.


89
0:6:2,52 --> 0:6:4,72
- How many people work for you ?
- It's just me and Bilbo.


90
0:6:4,72 --> 0:6:7,36
- Who's Bilbo ?
- The manager.


91
0:6:7,36 --> 0:6:9,88
- You're not a sci-fi nerd ?
- No !


92
0:6:9,88 --> 0:6:13,72
You spend evenings on the Internet
discussing symbolism in the X-Files ?


93
0:6:13,72 --> 0:6:15,8
Modern science fiction can be interesting.


94
0:6:15,8 --> 0:6:22,92
The speculations of contemporary authors
have probably never been closer to the truth.


95
0:6:22,92 --> 0:6:26,8
Right. Your preferred mode of transport
is skateboarding.


96
0:6:26,8 --> 0:6:30,24
You like music and regularly masturbate
over pictures of Gillian Anderson.


97
0:6:30,24 --> 0:6:32,6
- Who told you that ?
- It was a joke !


98
0:6:32,6 --> 0:6:35,52
FHM voted her sexiest woman in the world.


99
0:6:35,52 --> 0:6:37,68
- What about you ?
- I wasn't placed.


100
0:6:37,68 --> 0:6:41,24
You recently split up with your girlfriend
who got off with your friend Duane.


101
0:6:41,24 --> 0:6:43,8
He is not my friend !


102
0:6:43,8 --> 0:6:47,44
Well, we don't need to talk about that.
We can if you want, it obviously hit you hard.


103
0:6:47,44 --> 0:6:49,6
No !


104
0:6:49,6 --> 0:6:52,96
You prefer a tight-legged cotton pant
as opposed to the boxer.


105
0:6:52,96 --> 0:6:57,6
- Is all this necessary ?
- What if we're asked personal questions ?


106
0:6:57,6 --> 0:7:0,32
We're supposed to be a couple. Do me.


107
0:7:0,32 --> 0:7:5,44
OK. You were born in Richmond in 1975
to Ben and Emily Steiner.


108
0:7:5,44 --> 0:7:9,12
You have a brother and a sister,
older and younger respectively.


109
0:7:9,12 --> 0:7:11,84
- You graduated from Kingston Poly...
- University.


110
0:7:11,84 --> 0:7:15,8
Whatever, in 1996 with a degree
in humanities for which you got a third.


111
0:7:15,8 --> 0:7:17,84
Which is fine, what I expected.


112
0:7:17,84 --> 0:7:20,16
Michelle from EastEnders got a third.


113
0:7:20,16 --> 0:7:24,12
Anyway it's not the grade that matters,
it's being there that counts.


114
0:7:24,12 --> 0:7:28,52
- Your boyfriend Richard is studying in Hell.
- Hull.


115
0:7:28,52 --> 0:7:33,48
We won't mention him. You want to be a
journalist but you haven't quite tried that yet.


116
0:7:33,48 --> 0:7:37,56
Your best friend's called Twist
and she works in fashion.


117
0:7:37,56 --> 0:7:39,4
Er... yeah.


118
0:7:39,4 --> 0:7:42,72
You've got no skin-care routine to speak of.


119
0:7:42,72 --> 0:7:45,36
You're scared of mice and spiders


120
0:7:45,36 --> 0:7:50,2
but fear they will crossbreed
to form an all-powerful race of mice-spiders


121
0:7:50,2 --> 0:7:53,72
who will immobilise humans
in giant webs in order to steal cheese.


122
0:7:53,72 --> 0:7:56,8
- I never said that.
- It'd be good, though.


123
0:7:56,8 --> 0:7:58,24
That's it.


124
0:7:58,24 --> 0:8:4,4
- By the way, my name's Daisy.
- I'm Tim, hi.


125
0:8:4,4 --> 0:8:6,6
Hey ! What's that for ?


126
0:8:6,6 --> 0:8:10,48
We could do that thing like in that film with
Andie MacDowell and Gйrard Depardieu -


127
0:8:10,48 --> 0:8:14,4
where they get married
so he can get an American work permit.


128
0:8:14,4 --> 0:8:15,68
A green card ?


129
0:8:15,68 --> 0:8:30,32
- Yeah. What's it called ?
- I don't know.


130
0:8:30,32 --> 0:8:35,12
That should do it.


131
0:8:35,12 --> 0:8:46,76
Five eight three - this is it.
Five eight three, five eight three.


132
0:8:46,76 --> 0:8:53,48
- Five eight three, five eight three...
- Five eight three, five eight three...


133
0:8:53,48 --> 0:8:58,92
- I forgot what you had for your fifth birthday.
- Er, miniature drum kit.


134
0:8:58,92 --> 0:9:1,36
- Hey ! Hey !


135
0:9:1,36 --> 0:9:6,12
- I don't want to seem too pushy.
- All right.


136
0:9:6,12 --> 0:9:8,8
- Come on !


137
0:9:8,8 --> 0:9:10,84
Hello. I'm Marsha.


138
0:9:10,84 --> 0:9:20,92
- Hi. Er, we're a...
- A couple.


139
0:9:20,92 --> 0:9:23,36
Oh, yeah, it's really nice.


140
0:9:23,36 --> 0:9:27,28
Yeah, it's a great flat.


141
0:9:27,28 --> 0:9:30,52
Tim got a miniature drum kit
for his fifth birthday.


142
0:9:30,52 --> 0:9:34,0
- You what ?
- What's through there ?


143
0:9:34,0 --> 0:9:39,4
This is the guest bedroom,
which you can use for storage or utilities,


144
0:9:39,4 --> 0:9:45,44
or if the pair of you
want to bring another life into the world.


145
0:9:45,44 --> 0:9:48,48
- Yes, perfect for a child.
- Very, er...


146
0:9:48,48 --> 0:9:52,12
- Homy.
- Homy, yeah, homy. It's very homy.


147
0:9:52,12 --> 0:9:57,92
What's this ?


148
0:9:57,92 --> 0:10:1,2
We've finished cleaning the cupboard,
Mrs Klein.


149
0:10:1,2 --> 0:10:5,96
- Ah. Did it take you long ?
- Yes, it took forever.


150
0:10:5,96 --> 0:10:11,4
And ever. And ever.


151
0:10:11,4 --> 0:10:21,4
It's bob-a-job week.


152
0:10:21,4 --> 0:10:24,4
So, what do you both do for a living ?


153
0:10:24,4 --> 0:10:26,8
- Journalist.
- Graphic artist.


154
0:10:26,8 --> 0:10:28,72
Ooh, lovely. You working ?


155
0:10:28,72 --> 0:10:31,96
- What ?
- Working, earning money, cash ?


156
0:10:31,96 --> 0:10:34,52
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Yes, we are.


157
0:10:34,52 --> 0:10:36,92
- We're very...
- Busy.


158
0:10:36,92 --> 0:10:41,64
For all your comic needs... Fantasy Bazaar.


159
0:10:41,64 --> 0:10:45,36
- Oh, yeah, we're very, very busy.
- Yeah. Phew !


160
0:10:45,36 --> 0:10:49,16
- We're so busy ! We don't stop.
- I don't sleep. Ever.


161
0:10:49,16 --> 0:10:51,48
That's an exaggeration but we are very busy.


162
0:10:51,48 --> 0:10:54,28
We don't know what to do with it.


163
0:10:54,28 --> 0:10:56,72
So, how long you been together ?


164
0:10:56,72 --> 0:11:4,16
Five years, eight months, three days.


165
0:11:4,16 --> 0:11:8,12
Well...


166
0:11:8,12 --> 0:11:12,84
you can move in when you're ready.


167
0:11:12,84 --> 0:11:16,32
- Really ?
- Yep.


168
0:11:16,32 --> 0:11:19,12
Don't you wanna... see our photos ?


169
0:11:19,12 --> 0:11:21,64
Yeah...


170
0:11:21,64 --> 0:11:25,6
Come 'ere, you !


171
0:11:25,6 --> 0:11:29,16
Right. That's it, guys, I'm off.


172
0:11:29,16 --> 0:11:34,4
I'm outta here !


173
0:11:34,4 --> 0:11:37,4
I'll probably give you a call
about bills and stuff.


174
0:11:37,4 --> 0:11:41,44
Ooh ! We haven't got a phone, so...


175
0:11:41,44 --> 0:11:44,84
Well, that's it, I'm off, I'm going. Bye.


176
0:11:44,84 --> 0:11:47,48
Bye ! Bye ! Bye !


177
0:11:47,48 --> 0:12:0,84
Bye ! Bye ! Bye !


178
0:12:0,84 --> 0:12:9,32
Sir !


179
0:12:9,32 --> 0:12:11,36
It's yours.


180
0:12:11,36 --> 0:12:13,96
Thanks.


181
0:12:13,96 --> 0:12:16,0
Right.


182
0:12:16,0 --> 0:12:20,16
Do you have a phone number
in case I need to contact you about bills ?


183
0:12:20,16 --> 0:12:22,8
l-I'm not sure, Daisy's sorting that out.


184
0:12:22,8 --> 0:12:24,88
- Daisy ?
- Yeah.


185
0:12:24,88 --> 0:12:28,36
- Who's Daisy ?
- The girl I'm moving in with.


186
0:12:28,36 --> 0:12:31,4
What do you mean ? When did you meet her ?


187
0:12:31,4 --> 0:12:36,24
- About two weeks ago.
- And you're about to move in with her ?


188
0:12:36,24 --> 0:12:38,96
Yeah. You've got no right to be upset.


189
0:12:38,96 --> 0:12:43,44
You're the one that ended this,
you're the one seeing someone else.


190
0:12:43,44 --> 0:12:48,8
I've got to get on with my life.
I'm sorry if that upsets you, it's the way it is.


191
0:12:48,8 --> 0:12:52,6
You can't dangle the bogus carrot
of possible reconciliation in front of me


192
0:12:52,6 --> 0:12:56,12
whilst riding some other donkey. You know ?


193
0:12:56,12 --> 0:13:2,36
I'm moving on, Sarah.
If you don't like that, that's too bad.


194
0:13:2,36 --> 0:13:4,68
- Do you love her ?
- What ?


195
0:13:4,68 --> 0:13:9,72
Do you love her ?


196
0:13:9,72 --> 0:13:17,28
No, of course I don't love her, I love you !
Nobody could ever love you as much as I do.


197
0:13:17,28 --> 0:13:41,0
OK.


198
0:13:41,0 --> 0:13:46,4
Hey ! Crazy-Iooking naked
girl with no nipples, what are you doin' here ? !


199
0:13:46,4 --> 0:13:50,12
Cover yourself up, love.
Come on, cover yourself up.


200
0:13:50,12 --> 0:13:59,4
Tim ?


201
0:13:59,4 --> 0:14:26,44
Tim ?


202
0:14:26,44 --> 0:14:29,4
Argh ! Oh !


203
0:14:29,4 --> 0:14:32,28
- What are you doing ?
- Hi, Tim... Oh !


204
0:14:32,28 --> 0:14:34,48
I was just cleaning and, erm...


205
0:14:34,48 --> 0:14:40,24
Did you see the... Cos I changed the table...
Anyway... You don't like it, do you ?


206
0:14:40,24 --> 0:14:43,44
I heard a noise and I thought it was you
cos I was talking to myself...


207
0:14:43,44 --> 0:14:47,72
BT called and we've been connected.
So, do you want a tea ?


208
0:14:47,72 --> 0:14:52,44
You know, I like this room, it's lovely.
I like the... I like what you've done.


209
0:14:52,44 --> 0:14:53,76
Do you want a cup of tea ?


210
0:14:53,76 --> 0:14:58,4
- What noise ?
- I heard a noise, I thought I'd have a look.


211
0:14:58,4 --> 0:15:3,4
- Yeah, so... Did I tell you about BT ?
- Yeah, we've been connected.


212
0:15:3,4 --> 0:15:6,4
- Just investigating.
- Playing Scooby Doo ?


213
0:15:6,4 --> 0:15:10,4
Yeah. I was always Daphne when I was little.
Who were you ?


214
0:15:10,4 --> 0:15:12,8
Freddy, obviously.


215
0:15:12,8 --> 0:15:28,4
Freddy. Yeah. Now look at us.


216
0:15:28,4 --> 0:15:31,24
This guy's called the Bear, he's like a mutant.


217
0:15:31,24 --> 0:15:36,76
He's essentially a nice guy but he's driven
to violence by the society he inhabits.


218
0:15:36,76 --> 0:15:40,12
- Right. Who's that, then ?
- That's Doktor Mandrake.


219
0:15:40,12 --> 0:15:43,12
- Doctor Mandrake.
- Dok-tor Mandrake, it's got a K in it.


220
0:15:43,12 --> 0:15:47,64
He's a mad scientist. He invented this steroid
called oxypheromalkahyde.


221
0:15:47,64 --> 0:15:51,8
He tested it on this orphan kid
but it didn't work, did it ?


222
0:15:51,8 --> 0:15:55,4
So he chucked out his research,
chucked the kid out onto the street,


223
0:15:55,4 --> 0:15:57,8
but when the kid reached puberty,


224
0:15:57,8 --> 0:16:2,28
the dormant oxypheromalkahyde interrupted
DNA coding and he mutated into the Bear.


225
0:16:2,28 --> 0:16:5,96
Doktor Mandrake has dedicated his life
to capturing the Bear


226
0:16:5,96 --> 0:16:9,8
to rediscover
the effects of oxypheromalkahyde.


227
0:16:9,8 --> 0:16:17,96
So, why didn't the doctor
just make the oxypoxydrin again ?


228
0:16:17,96 --> 0:16:23,24
Well... because he'd invented it by accident,
didn't he ?


229
0:16:23,24 --> 0:16:27,64
These mutants are mistakes he's made
as he's tried to recreate the serum.


230
0:16:27,64 --> 0:16:32,24
- Like, see, that guy's got a really big head.
- Oh.


231
0:16:32,24 --> 0:16:35,64
- So, do you like my comic ?
- Yeah. Yeah.


232
0:16:35,64 --> 0:16:38,88
That reminds me,
I was talking to Marsha about the rubbish.


233
0:16:38,88 --> 0:16:45,8
There's a door that opens onto the back yard,
so we have to take it to the basement.


234
0:16:45,8 --> 0:16:48,4
I'll take those bin bags out, then, shall I ?


235
0:16:48,4 --> 0:17:2,4
- Do you want another cup of tea ?
- No, thanks. Twelve's my limit.


236
0:17:2,4 --> 0:17:8,4
Hello ?


237
0:17:8,4 --> 0:17:19,4
Hello ?


238
0:17:19,4 --> 0:17:24,8
Hello.


239
0:17:24,8 --> 0:17:29,32
- Daisy, this is Brian.
- Oh, hi ! Do you rent downstairs ?


240
0:17:29,32 --> 0:17:32,68
- Do you mean am I gay ?
- What ?


241
0:17:32,68 --> 0:17:34,72
Do you mean am I gay ?


242
0:17:34,72 --> 0:17:38,56
No, no, I meant
are you renting the downstairs flat ?


243
0:17:38,56 --> 0:17:42,48
Oh, right. Yep, sort of.


244
0:17:42,48 --> 0:17:44,52
- Are you gay ?
- What ?


245
0:17:44,52 --> 0:17:49,6
- Are you gay ?
- No.


246
0:17:49,6 --> 0:17:52,4
All right.


247
0:17:52,4 --> 0:17:54,84
Would you like a glass of wine or something ?


248
0:17:54,84 --> 0:17:58,6
Yeah, I can't stay long.


249
0:17:58,6 --> 0:18:5,4
And he invited me back to stay with his family
in Istanbul and I didn't like to say no.


250
0:18:5,4 --> 0:18:8,28
But his sisters kept me in the house all day.


251
0:18:8,28 --> 0:18:11,6
They made me eat green eggs
and watch Turkish television.


252
0:18:11,6 --> 0:18:16,2
So I had to escape through the window
in the small toilet.


253
0:18:16,2 --> 0:18:23,8
Hopefully, I'll get some publishers interested.


254
0:18:23,8 --> 0:18:26,4
- What do you do, Brian ?
- An artist.


255
0:18:26,4 --> 0:18:28,24
I'm an artist.


256
0:18:28,24 --> 0:18:31,8
- Oh ! What kind of thing do you do ?
- Anger.


257
0:18:31,8 --> 0:18:35,56
Aarrgghh !


258
0:18:35,56 --> 0:18:38,96
Pain.


259
0:18:38,96 --> 0:18:43,88
Fear.


260
0:18:43,88 --> 0:18:52,44
Aggression.


261
0:18:52,44 --> 0:18:56,88
- Watercolours or... ?
- It's a bit more complex than that.


262
0:18:56,88 --> 0:19:0,84
- Tim does cartoons.
- It's a little bit more complex than that.


263
0:19:0,84 --> 0:19:8,8
Processing concept into substance and
trying to create a string of independent forms.


264
0:19:8,8 --> 0:19:10,12
Like sausages ?


265
0:19:10,12 --> 0:19:14,6
I see contemporary art as a dirty plate
heaped with worthless junk food


266
0:19:14,6 --> 0:19:17,84
and I want something more nourishing.


267
0:19:17,84 --> 0:19:25,32
Like sausages ?


268
0:19:25,32 --> 0:19:27,36
What's that ?


269
0:19:27,36 --> 0:19:31,8
That's... Amber, Marsha's daughter.


270
0:19:31,8 --> 0:19:34,24
Marsha.


271
0:19:34,24 --> 0:19:43,32
Don't ask her
if she wants to talk about it.


272
0:19:43,32 --> 0:19:47,44
It was the fucking dog.


273
0:19:47,44 --> 0:19:52,64
It was like the dog
was some kind of replacement.


274
0:19:52,64 --> 0:19:57,0
He used to let her sleep in the bed,
actually in the bed.


275
0:19:57,0 --> 0:20:0,2
Sometimes I used to wonder.


276
0:20:0,2 --> 0:20:4,2
Anyway, eventually I had to say
"It is the dog or me."


277
0:20:4,2 --> 0:20:10,4
And he chose the dog.


278
0:20:10,4 --> 0:20:11,48
Bitch.


279
0:20:11,48 --> 0:20:14,36
Ahh ! Sarah !


280
0:20:14,36 --> 0:20:16,8
- Sarah ?
- Sarah ! I'm here.


281
0:20:16,8 --> 0:20:20,6
I'm here, it's OK. His pet name for me.


282
0:20:20,6 --> 0:20:23,8
Hm. Where does that come from ?


283
0:20:23,8 --> 0:20:25,48
My ex-girlfriend.


284
0:20:25,48 --> 0:20:27,4
Hello ?


285
0:20:27,4 --> 0:20:29,68
- It's me, Richard.
- Oh, hello.


286
0:20:29,68 --> 0:20:33,16
I got your phone number from your mum.
How's it going ?


287
0:20:33,16 --> 0:20:37,4
Oh, it's fine, you know, good, thanks.


288
0:20:37,4 --> 0:20:41,0
- What's the flat like ?
- Erm, very nice.


289
0:20:41,0 --> 0:20:46,84
Cool. Listen, I've been thinking, wondering
about that Tim guy you've moved in with.


290
0:20:46,84 --> 0:20:48,28
Yes !


291
0:20:48,28 --> 0:20:53,88
Look, I can't really talk now.
There's some people here. OK ?


292
0:20:53,88 --> 0:20:55,72
Oh, OK.


293
0:20:55,72 --> 0:21:0,16
- I love you, Daisy Duke !
- I love you, too, Boss Hogg.


294
0:21:0,16 --> 0:21:4,4
- I can't hear you !
- I love you, too, Boss Hogg.


295
0:21:4,4 --> 0:21:12,64
- Bye.
- 'Bye.'


296
0:21:12,64 --> 0:21:17,8
That was, er... Boss Hogg.


297
0:21:17,8 --> 0:21:24,8
- How long have you been together ?
- Five years, eight months, three days.


298
0:21:24,8 --> 0:21:27,16
That's what you said two days ago.


299
0:21:27,16 --> 0:21:31,64
 Shit ! 


300
0:21:31,64 --> 0:21:35,56
 It's at times like this I wish I was telepathic,
Don't you, Tim ? 


301
0:21:35,56 --> 0:21:40,12
 Oh, damn ! 


302
0:21:40,12 --> 0:21:44,4
- Daisy and me have two anniversaries.
- OK.


303
0:21:44,4 --> 0:21:46,56
Daisy takes it from when we kissed,


304
0:21:46,56 --> 0:21:50,56
I take it from
the first time we were physically intimate.


305
0:21:50,56 --> 0:21:53,12
Oh, that's sweet !


306
0:21:53,12 --> 0:21:54,92
Whose is it today ?


307
0:21:54,92 --> 0:21:57,2
- It's Daisy's.
- Mine.


308
0:21:57,2 --> 0:22:0,2
So you had sex before you kissed ?


309
0:22:0,2 --> 0:22:2,6
 Shit ! 


310
0:22:2,6 --> 0:22:8,24
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


311
0:22:8,24 --> 0:22:13,16
Happy anniversary.


312
0:22:13,16 --> 0:22:15,2
Well, good night.


313
0:22:15,2 --> 0:22:21,32
Are you gonna keep the table here ? Cos
I always think it works better by the window.


314
0:22:21,32 --> 0:22:25,12
It's up to you though, innit ? It's your flat now.


315
0:22:25,12 --> 0:22:28,8
Yes !


316
0:22:28,8 --> 0:22:41,52
- Night, Brian.
- Night.


317
0:22:41,52 --> 0:22:48,4
- Are you and Mar...
- Sh !


318
0:22:48,4 --> 0:22:55,44
Night. Thanks, see you later.


319
0:22:55,44 --> 0:22:57,48
 That was close, 


320
0:22:57,48 --> 0:23:0,44
You're telling me.


321
0:23:0,44 --> 0:23:5,64
Well... didn't get much unpacking done,
did we ?


322
0:23:5,64 --> 0:23:7,84
No.


323
0:23:7,84 --> 0:23:12,8
- Ooh ! Well...
- Well !


324
0:23:12,8 --> 0:23:17,52
- Well, well, well.
- Well, well, well, well, well.


325
0:23:17,52 --> 0:23:20,92
- Good night.
- Oh, OK. Night.


326
0:23:20,92 --> 0:23:24,8
- Off to beddy-byes.
- Yeah.


327
0:23:24,8 --> 0:23:27,84
Well done to that.


328
0:23:27,84 --> 0:23:29,96
- I'm knackered.
- Me too.


329
0:23:29,96 --> 0:23:39,68
- So, good night.
- Good night.


330
0:23:39,68 --> 0:25:39,68
- OK. Night.
- OK, well... You... Good night.
