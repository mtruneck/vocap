###24 Plus it was so cold and wet and boring in the outfield.
###28 I don't think I've ever seen a ball that slippery.
###32 It was a difficult catch, Mark. I wouldn't worry. And it's just softball.
###37 'This is it. All systems are go.
###39 'The apple is ripe, the cross hairs are centralised. '
###43 Soph, I was... wondering.
###46 Do you... like Indonesian food?
###49 Erm, Thai, I quite like...
###51 'I can't do it. It's too much. I'm not American. I can't... date.
###55 'Restaurant on a barge? I might as well propose.
###58 'The pub. That's the English way. '
###61 Why?
###62 Oh, just... Nothing.
###64 Everyone's going to the pub. You want to...?
###67 The work gang? I don't think so. Mind if I get changed?
###71 Oh, no, no. Not at all.
###74 'Oh, my God. She's taking off her top.
###76 'This is very promising. Or is it...?
###79 'Would she do this if she fancied me?
###81 'Maybe we're... Oh, God, no, no.
###84 'We're only bloody friends! '
###88 And she gave me a peck on the cheek. It's a nightmare!
###92 - Mm-hm. - I've got to close the deal,
###95 ask her out without asking her out.
###97 One step forward, two steps back - that's the key.
###100 - Mm. Yeah. - So how was your day?
###105 Oh, fine. Kind of weird.
###107 Mum rang to say that my Uncle Ray is a bit ill.
###110 - Yeah? Is it serious? - Dunno.
###112 He's in the hospice so I guess he's being looked after.
###116 Hospice? You... Jez, you know what a hospice is, don't you?
###121 Like a hospital but nicer.
###123 A hospice is where people go to... Who... are terminally ill.
###127 Oh. Right.
###129 Yeah, Mum said he was... what you said.
###133 I'm sure he'll be fine. He's not a quitter.
###136 Well, I have to say, probably not, mate.
###139 Probably not.
###140 No, he won't quit. Do you know what I fancy now? Some Good Life.
###145 Where's more Good Life?
###147 - '? Sail away, sail away...? ' - Are you going to give him a call?
###152 Ray? No. No.
###154 He'll have people calling him night and day, probably sick of it.
###158 I thought probably best to give him some peace and quiet.
###162 - '... inside... ' - You should call him.
###166 'My stomach's in my mouth and I think, "This isn't good. "'
###169 Good to see you, Uncle Ray. What you been up to?
###173 Mostly I've been lying in bed taking painkillers.
###177 Right. Cool.
###179 'Jesus, that wasn't very friendly. At least I came. '
###183 So, Ray,
###185 Jez tells me you worked on the force.
###188 That's right, Mark. 30 years.
###190 Blimey.
###192 So must be nice getting a bit of support from your police mates.
###196 The force. You can trust the force, can't you?
###199 - Yeah. - 'What's this?
###201 'This is meant to be my visit. He's hijacking my visit. '
###205 Mostly they just eat me wine gums...
###207 'Come on, say something. Something not about dying. Something inspiring. '
###212 Yeah.
###216 People can be so funny when it comes to illness, can't they?
###219 I mean, it's good that you, you know...
###222 Yeah, that's the one upside of this whole thing.
###226 Rediscovered that little guy with the crown of thorns and the big old heart.
###230 Yeah, that's really...
###233 a great thing to have, a faith.
###235 Yeah.
###237 Oh, yeah.
###238 Yeah.
###240 'That's nice. Ray's such a nice guy.
###243 'What a shame everything he believes is total rubbish. '
###248 OK, well, thanks for calling, Mum.
###251 OK, I will. Bye.
###255 Has it...?
###257 - Ray's dead. - Oh, man, I'm sorry.
###262 Uncle Ray.
###264 Football, ciggies.
###265 He was gonna make me a bow and arrow that could go through a dustbin.
###269 He never did, of course, but... wow.
###273 Shall I... turn over?
###275 Yeah. Maybe some Newsnight or something.
###278 I mean, I wish... maybe the family could come together.
###283 We could campaign against...
###286 or for something.
###288 Maybe a foundation. The Ray Foundation,
###291 - for Christians and coppers. - That's a nice idea.
###295 Something positive's got to come out of all this.
###298 Something.
###304 I guess I just need some comfort.
###308 Why does it have to happen?
###310 Why does death happen?
###312 Shit, I don't even know which day the binmen come.
###315 'This is pretty low. Milking Uncle Ray to get a...
###319 'Hey, I'm feeling bad. Why not get some nooky out of it? '
###322 I just feel so alone, you know?
###324 Sure. It's like after Tony left, I thought, "This is it, everything's over. "
###329 But then I thought, "Hey, no, sort it out. "
###332 - Buy a juicer. - Right. But Toni...
###334 You'd better go.
###336 Classified dates can be uptight about times.
###339 Go. But I really feel that tonight, I need someone to...
###343 Jeremy, this is a hot one.
###345 He's six foot, he loves movies and walks, and we totally clicked on the phone.
###350 'How can she be this heartless to someone who's as upset as I say I am?
###354 'Maybe I am as upset as I say I am, it's just coming out weird. '
###358 Toni, listen, nothing could make me feel better about Ray's death.
###363 Except maybe one thing could.
###366 Look, Jeremy, death happens, people die. Move on.
###370 My dad died when I was three but it didn't screw me up.
###373 'Right. '
###375 I don't waste my life looking for a man to fill a dad-shaped hole.
###382 'It's perfect. Big social occasion but no invites.
###386 'It's not a date but it is.
###388 'What if it all goes right, though?
###391 'What about my massive, freakish balls? Don't get ahead of yourself. '
###395 - Hey, Soph. - Hey, Mark, how's it going?
###397 Well, actually, things have been a bit tough.
###401 - Jeremy's uncle passed away yesterday. - Oh, no.
###404 - Oh, that is difficult. Is he OK? - Yeah, bearing up.
###407 But listen, Sophie, I wanted to ask you,
###410 might you be free on Friday?
###413 - For the funeral? - The funeral?
###415 'Oh, no, shit. It's not perfect, it's cracked. Piss. '
###419 You don't have to. I just thought it might be nice if...
###423 No, I'd be honoured. If you want a friend to go, then...
###426 No, no, not friend. No. As a kind of... date.
###430 I thought afterwards, if you like, we could go somewhere.
###434 - Won't there be a wake? - Somewhere like the wake.
###437 Sure. Great. Erm, er, if that's OK, I'm invited?
###441 That's the beauty. No invites at a funeral.
###444 Right.
###446 "As Jonno let rip with the stolen Kalashnikov
###450 "and Squarehead fired off a round of monkey puzzler,
###454 "I looked at the towel-head I'd slotted... "
###457 'Where did they get this guy? This is a freak show.
###461 'Why am I even here? Why is she here? '
###464 "I didn't stop to think about it long. We all get slotted sometime. "
###472 Thanks, Keith.
###474 Scorpio Patrol, Real Life Behind Enemy Lines.
###478 One of my brother's favourites.
###480 Now, whilst no one would suggest that the faith Ray claimed to find
###484 in those last weeks was only a product...
###487 'I'm glad we stopped going to Liz's for Christmas.
###490 "'Thanks for the Fairtrade nuts, Auntie. "
###493 'She's loving this. What a stitch-up. '
###496 Now, in the humanist ceremony at this point,
###499 we like to encourage anyone who wants to share a thought or memory
###504 or reflection about my brother, to speak up.
###510 'Words... coming. '
###513 'Hey, yeah. OK. The sympathy vote. '
###517 'I'm gonna blow this gaff wide open. '
###520 Er, yeah.
###522 I spent some time with Ray before he... went.
###527 And I just wanted to say that I think we should all remember
###531 that Ray, by the end, he loved Jesus.
###536 Now, I know, Liz, there's no proof for Jesus,
###540 but then there's no proof for lots of things
###544 like... science or... the stock market.
###548 And we believe in them.
###550 Look, what I'm trying to say is that, if I was dying, and I decided that
###555 even though I'd never particularly been into, say...
###560 Enya before
###562 but that now I really, really was into Enya
###566 and that in fact I thought Enya was great
###569 and that Enya died for our sins
###572 and I wanted an Enya-themed funeral
###574 with pictures of Enya and lots and lots of mentions of... Enya,
###579 then I think it would be a bit bloody rich for my sister
###584 to ban all mention of Enya from my funeral.
###588 Yeah?
###594 'Well done, Jez, old mate. You did him proud.
###598 ' Oh, poor Ray.
###600 'He's in there,
###602 'in that cardboard box.
###604 'I can't believe it.
###606 'Shit! This just gets better and better. '
###608 Yeah, I guess it just came from in here.
###611 Or maybe...
###613 - up there? - Ah, yes.
###615 Yeah?
###617 - Here's to God! - To God.
###619 - Can I get you anything? - No, I'm OK.
###622 I'll be fine. I've got to be strong for Jeremy.
###626 He was great, wasn't he? Moments like this make you realise how short life is.
###631 Right. One minute we're alive, the next we're dead.
###636 Sometimes we're so wrapped up in the nonsense of life.
###639 Right, yeah.
###641 I mean, if I want an Xbox, why don't I just get an Xbox?
###645 - Yeah. - 'You're losing her. '
###647 It's a brief candle.
###649 A bloody brief candle.
###652 Yep.
###654 Sophie...
###656 c- can I say how beautiful you look?
###659 - Thank you, Mark. - Can...
###661 Can I kiss you, Sophie?
###666 'Oh, my God. Umm...
###668 'What about my abnormal knackers?
###670 'Ooh, this is nice. How weird are they?
###674 'What I really need is a good, long look at another man's bollocks.
###678 'But that's so fraught with potential problems. '
###683 Oh. That was nice.
###685 - Yeah, that was nice. - 'Thank you, Ray! Thank you, Ray! '
###691 ? Onward Christian soldiers
###695 ? Marching as to war...?
###698 'It must have been taken shortly before he died. '
###701 'God. You think you're in, then the smiting, plagues and pestilence starts.
###707 'Shit, I can't believe it. '
###709 Hey, Jez! I've got news!
###712 - So have I. - Sophie's coming away with me
###714 to a cottage with a bed for the weekend.
###718 Now, listen, mate,
###719 I need to ask you a straight-up, man-to-man question about bollocks.
###724 The hospital called. What Ray died of, Boden-Georgeson syndrome,
###728 - it's hereditary. - What? Y-You're kidding.
###732 I might have it. They want me to go in for tests.
###735 Tests? Jesus, mate. Fuck.
###738 - No, are you OK? - Yeah.
###742 No. To be honest, I'm scared.
###746 - Look, don't be scared. - I am scared.
###750 Don't be scared.
###752 I am scared.
###755 That's fine, that's fine.
###757 It's perfectly natural to be scared.
###761 'Doctor Runciman has seen this a thousand times.
###764 'It's just two guys, one with his hand on the other guy's balls. '
###769 Mark Corrigan?
###772 Dr Runciman's on call. I'm the practice nurse.
###775 Oh. Pleased to meet you.
###778 'No. No, no, no, no, no. '
###780 - So how can I help? - Oh, it was just...
###783 I think I should see the doctor.
###785 Not that I've got anything against your... kind.
###788 If you tell me the problem, maybe I can deal with it.
###792 Basically, it's - not wishing to beat about the bush -
###796 it's a problem with...
###798 with my...
###800 Penis?
###802 Testisticles.
###804 - So if you'd feel happier, I... - OK, trousers down, hop on the couch,
###808 let's have a look at the little fellows.
###811 'Oh, I hope I don't... No leaping to attention, Captain Corrigan.
###815 'Anyone would say she's an attractive woman.
###818 'She should have to wear a mask.
###820 'Reagan or Batman or...
###822 'Actually, she'd look pretty horny as Batman. Jesus, no, don't! '
###826 So have you worked here long?
###830 - Blimey. - Blimey? What's blimey?
###833 - Does that feel painful? - No, no. That feels great.
###837 I mean, not great, just normal.
###839 'Oh, how much can a man take? '
###842 You've got a large hydrocele.
###843 It's a simple procedure. The scalpel just slips in at the back of the scrotum.
###849 'That's cooled things off, a regular bucket of water. '
###852 'Abandon self-cherishing, love only others.
###856 'Yeah, well, Mr Dalai Lama,
###858 'you've got to be a suck-up if you haven't got your own country.
###861 'OK, stay focused.
###863 'Don't have to do them all, just till you find something to hold on to.
###868 'Islam. Not really such a fashionable religion.
###872 'Hinduism? That's got a nice vibe.
###874 'Find out the Hindus and the Hindon'ts.
###877 'Good old Bible. Bit "dribble not the ass's milk on Tuesday. "
###881 'And I know most of it from The Omen. '
###884 OK, Jez, mate. I think that's about it.
###886 Uh-huh. Well, have a good time, mate.
###895 - Is he OK? - I don't know.
###897 He gets the test results on Monday.
###899 - What do you think? - He seems a bit on edge.
###902 The thing is, he's not definitely dying.
###904 - He's not even definitely ill. - You're probably right.
###907 - What about the carving on his arm? - That's just Biro.
###911 Anyway, he seems to be over that now. And the whinnying.
###915 Things are looking positive. He's investigating the key to all spiritualities.
###920 'Try and read a poem, listen to inspiring music,
###923 'look at a wonderful painting... '
###925 'Or I could finish the last of that skunk,
###929 'sit on Big Suze's dildo and wank myself dry.
###932 'I could go to that place Super Hans says is a knocking shop.
###936 'Lf not, bang a tab and get a massage. '
###938 Er, Jez.
###940 Me and Soph, we were just having a chat,
###943 and, well, what we were saying is that what we both really want
###947 is for you to come along on our weekend.
###950 Yeah? Oh, I kind of had plans.
###954 Oh, you can take your religious texts with you.
###957 - 'Maybe he doesn't want to come. ' - No point, it's all bullshit.
###961 'God, he really wants me to come. '
###964 It'll be such a laugh.
###966 'Please say no, please say no. '
###968 Er, well, all right. I guess. If you really want me to.
###972 'I didn't realise he was this terrified of sex. '
###976 'If I can get the first one over without major embarrassment.
###980 'First fuck is damage limitation.
###982 'In, out, as much pleasure as I can give her,
###985 'apologise, and then we can move on.
###989 'Jesus, look at him. What a disaster. '
###992 Jeremy, it's your go, isn't it?
###994 Er, whatever. I just want to rewind this bit.
###997 Do you have to? We're trying to play a game.
###1000 I gave you the choice - Tom and Barbara being nice
###1003 or Gloria and Mitzy being nasty.
###1005 If you don't want your go, I'll attack Irkutsk.
###1009 Fine. Can't you get it into your closed-off little mind that I don't give a flying fuck?
###1015 You will when I take Asia.
###1017 Bleaurgh, bleaurgh, bleaurgh, bleaurgh, bleaurgh.
###1019 Nothing means anything. It's all just shit!
###1023 Games, snacks, fires, man, woman, love.
###1026 We're all gonna end up in the cold, deep ground, and that's all there is. OK?
###1032 Well, fine. I'm off for a shower.
###1035 Good night, Jeremy.
###1037 - See you in the bed... room, Soph. - Yeah, sure.
###1042 'Oh, what I really want's a woman.
###1045 'Oh, God, I'm never gonna have a woman again in my life.
###1049 'I never planted my seed. My loins are like dried buckwheat.
###1053 'It's not fair. '
###1055 So Jeremy, I'm going to turn in.
###1057 Hope you sleep OK.
###1060 Er, thanks.
###1064 Er, Sophie, could I have a quick word?
###1067 - In private. - Sure, I mean, this is private.
###1077 Must be hell trying to cope with all this.
###1079 Well, yeah.
###1082 Bloody hell, what are you doing?
###1084 Oh, go on. This could be the last time I do it.
###1087 Imagine how committed I'd be?
###1089 - I'm here with Mark. - Mark...
###1092 doesn't love you. He doesn't even like you.
###1095 - What? - He...
###1098 He said he's only snogging you for a joke.
###1101 And he draws horrible, vicious cartoons of you
###1104 and wraps them up in sausage meat and calls you a sausage muncher.
###1108 You're drunk, Jeremy. Try and get some sleep.
###1112 Go on. I might be dead in a week.
###1115 Jeremy, look, I'm flattered but I'm here with Mark.
###1118 - What about a threes-up? - Jeremy, Mark's...
###1121 All right, OK, I get the message.
###1124 Sophie?
###1129 Jez must've gone for a walk. Thank God.
###1132 You think he'd be more grateful.
###1134 He'll change his tune when I'm in charge of the morphine.
###1138 It's like that, is it? That's how it's going to be?
###1141 - Well, excuse me! - Jez, I didn't... I didn't mean.
###1147 'Oh, wow. Oh, yeah.
###1149 'Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, she is so...
###1152 'Where am I? Put your tongue out and see.
###1155 'Neck? Yeah, neck. Oh.
###1158 'Whoo-hoo-ho-ho. Ha-ha! You can do that again. Oh, yeah. '
###1162 - Mark? - Yeah?
###1164 Are you going to take your pants off?
###1167 Er, yeah.
###1169 Yeah, I will. But, Sophie, before I do,
###1172 I need to prepare you for something.
###1174 I intend to have an operation
###1177 but until I do, I don't want you to be alarmed by the size of my...
###1181 Mark, stop boasting and get some johnnies.
###1185 Shit, they're in the bathroom.
###1188 - Stay there, don't go away. - I'm not going anywhere.
###1192 'Got to be quick. Don't want to have to get her all worked up again.
###1197 'Did she say johnnies plural?
###1199 'Hope she doesn't think I'm some sort of superman. '
###1204 'Couldn't even be bothered to go to bed. It's pathetic.
###1207 'What's...? Oh, my God. He's...
###1210 'No. Don't be dead, mate.
###1212 'Shit, no. Oh, God, no. In front of...
###1215 'Tenko. That was probably the last straw.
###1218 'Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Don't be dead, mate! Please don't be dead!
###1223 'My cock's gone right down. Fuck. '
###1225 Sophie! Soph! Something awful has happened.
###1234 What?
###1236 He's opened his eyes. Jez, we're right here, Jez.
###1239 - What's going on? - You're in safe hands now, Jez.
###1244 Was he behaving strangely before the overdose?
###1247 No. No more than usual.
###1249 Well, he did... I didn't tell you this. He did make a pass at me.
###1254 A pass? He... The bloody...!
###1257 He's been under a lot of stress recently.
###1260 How many pills did you take, Jeremy?
###1262 It's important you remember how many you took.
###1266 Pills? Just the one.
###1268 He's delirious, the bottle was empty.
###1270 Yeah, it was the last one.
###1272 I had a headache. Has anyone got any Coke? My mouth's all...
###1276 I invite you here and you repay me by trying to...
###1280 have it away with my girlfriend.
###1283 - I don't think girlfriend's quite... - I've been feeling very low.
###1287 Oh, were you? Were you?
###1289 Yeah. I was feeling desperate.
###1291 I mean, that's why... that's why I took the overdose.
###1295 - What? But you... - I couldn't admit it.
###1298 I was ashamed. But I did it.
###1300 The bottle was full, I... I took the whole lot.
###1304 OK, if you two step to one side, I'm gonna do a stomach pump.
###1308 What? Er, no... Actually...
###1311 I admit it, I was joking. I was lying just then, not before.
###1315 I didn't take an overdose. Put away the hardware.
###1318 I was lying just then. Don't pump me! Don't pump me!
###1327 - What the fuck? - Soph, it's only me.
###1329 - I've got something for you. - Don't do that.
###1332 - No one was coming. - That's not the point.
###1335 - It's not? - No. Mark, we need to have a talk.
###1339 - A talk? Oh. - Mark...
###1342 a funeral, it's an emotional time, lots of emotions.
###1346 - Are you finishing with me? - We weren't ever really...
###1350 Right.
###1351 Not that something might not, some day...
###1354 Everything was a bit "whoosh!" and I'd rather it was "dum-de-dum-de-dum".
###1358 OK, well, that's just... I guess...
###1362 you know...
###1364 Did you want to give me something?
###1366 Er, no, it's...
###1371 it's your pants.
###1373 Oh.
###1375 I found them in my suitcase
###1377 and I thought you...
###1380 Anyway, er...
###1382 here you go.
###1386 Er, well, thanks.
###1388 Not a problem.
###1391 OK, well, I'll see you.
###1393 See you... not around but here.
###1396 OK, g... great. See you.
###1417 So I, er... I got the test results.
###1423 It's positive.
###1425 Oh dear.
###1427 - Oh, Jez. - Are you OK?
###1431 It's all broken. It's knackered.
###1435 He dumped me.
###1438 Daddy's gone again.
###1442 Why does it happen?
###1445 There are all these people singing and dancing but never me.
###1449 I'm sorry, I'll shut up.
###1452 My problems are nothing compared to...
###1455 Three months?
###1457 Three to six.
###1459 Jesus, Jeremy. Jesus.
###1462 'I'll say miracle drug cure. Maybe she'll give me another one as congratulations.
###1467 'God, hope she doesn't start crying again.
###1470 'Got to... before she...
###1472 'Come on.
###1474 'I am gonna feel so low
###1477 'as soon as this is over. '
###1480 ? Sail away, sail away, sail away
###1485 ? Sail away, sail away, sail away
###1489 ? Sail away, sail away, sail away
###1493 ? Sail away, sail away, sail away
###1496 ? From the north to the south Ebudae into Khartoum
###1499 ? From the deep sea...?
