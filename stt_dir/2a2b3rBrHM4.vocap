###0 TIM HARRINGTON: Nashville--
###16 Music City.
###17 Our time here's tight so we gotta make it quick.
###20 Our man on the ground is Ben Swank, Nashville musical
###23 kingpin and Jack White's right hand man on Third Man Records.
###26 I just called him and he sent me straight to
###28 Phil Kaufman's house--
###29 AKA, The Mangler.
###30 
###46 He's a national celebrity and probably the most infamous
###49 roadie ever for many reasons, but none moreso than for
###52 stealing Gram Parson's body and burning it.
###56 I've heard he's an amazing character and an unmatched
###58 storyteller, but he'll eat you for breakfast if he doesn't
###61 like the look of you.
###63 So I've got my best pants on.
###64 
###69 Phil Kaufman, I presume?
###70 PHIL KAUFMAN: Hey man thanks for waiting.
###71 TIM HARRINGTON: How's it going?
###72 PHIL KAUFMAN: Good to see you, man.
###73 TIM HARRINGTON: Good to see you-- it's Tim Harrington.
###74 PHIL KAUFMAN: Do you want to go inside?
###75 TIM HARRINGTON: Sure
###78 PHIL KAUFMAN: This is the Casa De Mangler.
###80 All my memorabilia is on the wall--
###82 and in my mind.
###83 Over here, there's the wall of shame with Steve Earle, and
###88 Emmylou, Gram Parsons.
###90 TIM HARRINGTON: I love this picture.
###92 PHIL KAUFMAN: Oh this one here.
###94 That's early rock and roll--
###95 money, cocaine, hashish, and a gun--
###98 [INAUDIBLE] off to work.
###99 TIM HARRINGTON: That's all you need.
###100 PHIL KAUFMAN: Up to the office.
###101 Up to the office, yeah.
###102 I celebrated 3/4 of a century and no progress last year--
###107 76 this year and still at it.
###109 Still riding motorcycles, scuba diving, and chasing
###112 younger women--
###113 you know, 65, 70--
###116 the young girls.
###117 
###122 TIM HARRINGTON: How did you get started?
###124 PHIL KAUFMAN: When I got out of prison--
###125 I was a marijuana felon in the '60s--
###127 so my buddy called me up and said Mick Jagger and Marianne
###131 Faithfull were coming to LA.
###133 And they needed somebody to drive them around-- somebody
###135 new to the area--
###136 the guy bought me a pair of shoes, and it was time to go
###139 to the studio doing mixing of Beggars Banquet.
###142 And I got to the studio and they said, who's there, and I
###145 said Rolling Stones.
###147 They said, they're not here, I said yeah they're here.
###150 I heard the guy in the back says, they're not only here on
###152 the right day, they're on time.
###154 And I said they're going to be on time every day.
###156 So I drove them back to their house--
###159 brand new '68 Cadillac convertible--
###162 and Mick said, how are you getting home?
###163 I said, I'm going to have to walk--
###165 I didn't have any money--
###166 and Mick says, oh shit.
###167 He took $1,500--
###169 all the money he had in his pocket-- handed it to me, gave
###171 me the keys to the car, and said, see you tomorrow.
###174 TIM HARRINGTON: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] a little bit
###175 better than [INAUDIBLE] horror movies.
###177 PHIL KAUFMAN:That was my first day in the music business.
###178 All of a sudden--
###179 I said this is pretty good.
###180 Than Gram Parsons came in about a week later.
###183 Gram asked me if I'd work for the Flying
###186 Burrito Brothers, touring.
###188 And I said, what does a road manager do?
###190 He said, well, it's the same thing you
###192 did with the Stones--
###193 you know how--
###193 you just take it on the road.
###195 I said, oh shit, I can do that.
###196 TIM HARRINGTON: But I'd like to talk about Gram.
###198 PHIL KAUFMAN: Well, I met Gram--
###200 as I said, through the Flying Burrito Brothers--
###202 and we went to a funeral for Clarence White, who was the
###205 guitar player for the Byrds.
###206 And Gram and everybody there were saying, if Clarence had
###210 his choice, if would definitely not have been his
###211 choice of a funeral-- it would have been a
###212 little bit more subtle.
###214 So Gram and I had a few sherbets, and we each said, if
###220 I die first, I want you to take my body out to the desert
###222 and burn it.
###223 I said, me too.
###224 Is it a deal?
###224 And we shook on it.
###226 Course the asshole died several months later.
###229 And I'm sitting around the house playing should've.
###231 I should've been with him, I shouldn't have let him do
###233 this, I should've--
###234 So anyhow, my girlfriend says, get off your ass and to do it.
###237 So I did.
###238 I borrowed a hearse from a friend, went out to LAX and
###242 convinced them that the family wanted the body flown out to
###245 New Orleans.
###246 TIM HARRINGTON: So you just took him out to Joshua Tree?
###247 PHIL KAUFMAN: I took him out to Joshua Tree and opened up
###249 the casket.
###250 We used to play this game-- what have you got something on
###251 your shirt?
###253 That was the last thing he got from me.
###255 And then I put the gas on him and said see you around pal.
###259 I lit a match and threw it in.
###260 It went-- boom.
###262 It was a big flame ball of oxygen as the gasoline
###266 ignited, and I could see his ashes
###267 going up into the desert.
###269 I said, my job's done here.
###270 And then we left.
###273 A couple of days later the police arrested me for grand
###277 theft Parsons.
###278 
###281 TIM HARRINGTON: You produced Manson's record.
###284 PHIL KAUFMAN: Yeah.
###285 TIM HARRINGTON: Is it true you worked on it?
###286 PHIL KAUFMAN: Yeah, Charlie--
###286 Charlie Manson.
###287 I've got the original copies inside.
###290 TIM HARRINGTON: Oh yeah?
###290 PHIL KAUFMAN: Yeah, I'll show you.
###292 I heard him singing in the prison yard--
###293 he sounded like a young Frankie Laine.
###295 So when I got out, I stayed with Charlie and the family
###297 for awhile.
###298 I have had sex with more murderers than
###301 anybody in show business.
###303 But then Charlie got a little crazy and I said, I got to go.
###308 He said, you can't stay here-- you're too smart.
###311 TIM HARRINGTON: He's like, you've got to be the smartest
###313 one around.
###313 PHIL KAUFMAN: You can't be smart
###314 hanging out with Charlie--
###315 Charlie does the thinking.
###317 Here's something-- the original Charles Manson
###321 album-- we only did 300 of them, but it's been bootlegged
###324 for quite a few years now.
###326 He gave me the rights to his music-- and this is just taken
###329 from 1/4 inch tape-- it's not a very good mix, but it's the
###333 original one.
###334 He used to call me occasionally, and the last
###336 time he called me he was rambling on and on.
###339 And I said, Charlie, the difference between you and I
###343 is that you're doing life and I'm living it.
###346 He said, you think that's funny?
###347 I said it's fucking hysterical--
###348 don't call me again.
###350 And I hung up on him and I haven't heard from him since.
###354 I hope I haven't offended him.
###357 Those murderers are so touchy.
###360 TIM HARRINGTON: Was part of your job ever involving
###362 scoring tail for the bands?
###363 Or have they got that covered on this own?
###365 PHIL KAUFMAN: If somebody sees somebody they like--
###366 a girl--
###367 we'll wave at her.
###367 I'll just give her a backstage pass and then bring her back.
###370 Like Sweet Connie--
###372 you ever heard of Sweet Connie?
###373 Connie was a schoolteacher in Little Rock, Arkansas, and she
###379 used to come out--
###380 can I say "blow job?"
###382 TIM HARRINGTON: You can say blow job, you can say, suck
###383 cock-- you can say whatever you want.
###384 PHIL KAUFMAN: She would come back to service the band and
###386 then do their laundry when they come to her town.
###390 And then some of them would fly her out there-- and she'd
###392 do the same thing--
###394 and I've seen the top of her head.
###396 
###400 But she's notorious--
###402 everybody knows Sweet Connie.
###404 TIM HARRINGTON: I want to know Sweet Connie.
###406 PHIL KAUFMAN: She's in a book.
###406 These are pictures in my book.
###407 
###411 My job is to get them to work as gracefully as possible,
###414 plug them in in, and out of their.
###415 Way I don't like the them and us attitude that some
###418 musicians have.
###419 The roadies are them--
###421 and then the musicians are [INAUDIBLE]
###422 We're all together.
###424 These guys aren't plugging it in, you ain't shit.
###426 TIM HARRINGTON: You're a lifer?
###427 PHIL KAUFMAN: I'm a lifer, yeah.
###429 But it's show-business God I love it.
###434 TIM HARRINGTON: Good ol' Mangler.
###435 
###438 I was just getting started in my stories about Zappa, and
###441 Morrison, and Joe Cocker, but I had to go to meet
###444 Nashville guy, Ben.
###446 What is this place?
###447 BEN SWANK: This is our record store, where we sell all of
###450 our Third Man wares.
###452 So the idea is like, the old Sun
###455 Records or Fortune Records--
###456 something like that-- where you record the records in the
###458 back and then sell them in the front.
###459 So we only sell Third Man stuff.
###461 All of our miscellany, t-shirts, 45 [INAUDIBLE]
###465 all kinds of random novelty, and junk.
###468 TIM HARRINGTON: The dude that sells black
###469 lacquer in town is psyched.
###471 BEN SWANK: He's psyched.
###473 We do a lot of shows back too.
###475 A few of Jack's bands played, obviously--
###478 all the bands on the label play here.
###479 TIM HARRINGTON: So this is a live--
###481 BEN SWANK: The live room-- holds about 300 people.
###484 This is where we do photo shoots,
###486 video shoots back here.
###487 Far as we know, it's the only venue where you can record
###490 straight to analog tape.
###491 TIM HARRINGTON: Straight to analog tape.
###491 BEN SWANK: Jack produces and mixes all of the [INAUDIBLE]
###494 albums himself--
###495 so he's really hands on with all of it.
###497 TIM HARRINGTON: That's cool.
###498 For me, I'm really into whale-watching.
###501 You lay down--
###502 naked--
###503 and you look down, and you're trying to give yourself a
###505 boner without touching.
###507 And it kind of like, flops around like a whale.
###511 And you can look down, and be like, whoa, she breached.
###515 BEN SWANK: I've never done that.
###517 TIM HARRINGTON: [INAUDIBLE]
###517 BEN SWANK: See that's weird.
###520 We just met.
###522 I'm sensitive.
###523 TIM HARRINGTON: I understand.
###525 
###527 Oh man, I always get a little too friendly
###529 and mess things up.
###530 Ben doesn't seem too mad though--
###532 he said he's going to take me to Glen Danzig's house.
###535 It's like a house party place, where these dudes put on shows
###537 in their house, and I was like, yes.
###540 
###543 While these guys set up a show, I can work on my new
###546 Nashville-inspired, four-part, electronic opus.
###549 [ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING]
###576 TIM HARRINGTON: Is that a longstanding tradition in
###579 Nashville to have a black-out [INAUDIBLE] --
###581 to have punk spaces?
###582 BEN TODD: Sort of.
###583 It comes and goes.
###585 I usually run the door and run the sound and make sure bands
###589 are going on time.
###591 TIM HARRINGTON: What's happening tonight?
###592 Let's talk about the lineup.
###594 BEN TODD: Having a show with Big Surr, Cy Barkley and the
###597 Way Outsiders, and Natural Child.
###599 TIM HARRINGTON: Natural Child, I really like.
###600 BEN TODD:Local lords.
###602 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###627 TIM HARRINGTON: Which member of Natural Child are you?
###628 WES: I'm Wes.
###629 TIM HARRINGTON: What do you do?
###630 WES: I play bass and sing.
###631 ZACH: I'm Zach.
###631 TIM HARRINGTON: What do you do?
###632 ZACH: I play drums.
###634 TIM HARRINGTON: Piss McMurray.
###635 What do you do?
###637 - I pee turned around at interviews.
###640 TIM HARRINGTON: Watch out-- it's hitting your shoes.
###641 - It's all right--
###642 I've got boots on.
###643 TIM HARRINGTON: You guys are road dogs.
###644 Where are you guys from?
###646 WES: Nashville, Tennessee.
###647 TIM HARRINGTON: Right here?
###648 What do you guys travel in when you're on tour?
###650 - A minivan.
###651 TIM HARRINGTON: Mini V?
###653 - But don't show it because we don't want the police to know.
###656 TIM HARRINGTON: How long are you on the road for when
###658 you're on tour?
###659 Long stints?
###659 Little short runs?
###660 - Never more than two or three weeks.
###663 TIM HARRINGTON: I thought you said you guys were road dogs.
###665 - Well, we are.
###666 That's good.
###667 See, listen--
###667 if you tour too much.
###669 TIM HARRINGTON: Lapdogs.
###669 I thought you guys were like a big ol' Turner & Hooch dog,
###672 but now I'm like, [INAUDIBLE] chihuahuas.
###674 - We're all tired, and you lose your shit.
###676 You get sick--
###677 everybody gets sick at least one on tour--
###679 it's terrible.
###681 TIM HARRINGTON: You roll into the club--
###682 what's the vibe?
###683 What vibe do you want, when you're like, this
###684 is going to be good?
###686 - Everybody handing us weed.
###689 Smoking [INAUDIBLE] the bar.
###692 TIM HARRINGTON: Let's hear it for the Natural Seed.
###694 
###709 Let's wrap it up.
###710 What have I learned in Nashville?
###711 One, I want Mangler to be my dad.
###714 Two, I want to live in Third Man Records.
###716 Three, I want to hang out at Glen Danzig's house every
###718 night for the rest of my life.
###721 [YELLING]
###731 TIM HARRINGTON: So there's only three
###732 cities left to hit--
###734 and one of them is on the other side of the country.
###736 Time to see if my road dog tendencies
###738 are still in tiz-act.
###739
