1
0:0:0,12 --> 0:0:4,61
does have one of course is known for
going out for the banks and uh... now


2
0:0:4,61 --> 0:0:7,259
that you senator from massachusetts


3
0:0:7,259 --> 0:0:11,58
not just one of the banks that you do
your job going after the regulators


4
0:0:11,58 --> 0:0:15,59
so that's a real problem because the
regulators have done nothing


5
0:0:15,59 --> 0:0:16,48
to go after the big banks


6
0:0:16,48 --> 0:0:20,789
beshi question the regulators before
news is great moment we should ask them


7
0:0:20,789 --> 0:0:24,829
he when's the last time you brought to
the top banking service to trial


8
0:0:24,829 --> 0:0:26,789
we should all the regulators lined up


9
0:0:26,789 --> 0:0:31,369
and not one of them could answer because
it was so far back know what we're


10
0:0:31,369 --> 0:0:33,22
member of the last time they brought


11
0:0:33,22 --> 0:0:37,719
and big bang executive to trial right so
this time around to pass them


12
0:0:37,719 --> 0:0:38,499
but we've just


13
0:0:38,499 --> 0:0:39,65
video


14
0:0:39,65 --> 0:0:42,24
where you protected the bankers again


15
0:0:42,24 --> 0:0:43,31
and but you know


16
0:0:43,31 --> 0:0:46,75
all that what they were doing in for
closing outhouses was wrong


17
0:0:46,75 --> 0:0:48,649
ish in a bid for closing on those houses


18
0:0:48,649 --> 0:0:53,99
and your job is to protect consumers so
she's got a question amman that town and


19
0:0:53,99 --> 0:0:54,83
it's going to be a loss


20
0:0:54,83 --> 0:0:57,13
regarding the basic data and


21
0:0:57,13 --> 0:1:0,38
processes of the independent foreclosure
review


22
0:1:0,38 --> 0:1:4,96
we may fourteen specific request to you
in january


23
0:1:4,96 --> 0:1:9,74
and despite multiple letters back and
forth and multiple meetings


24
0:1:9,74 --> 0:1:13,55
you have provided only one full response


25
0:1:13,55 --> 0:1:23,71
three partial or a minimal responses and
no response to nine of our requests


26
0:1:23,71 --> 0:1:25,82
cashiers they haven't asked for


27
0:1:25,82 --> 0:1:29,25
that you know you're supposed to be
accountable palace you're supposed to


28
0:1:29,25 --> 0:1:32,34
call the government you're holding the
bank's account of what we're past the


29
0:1:32,34 --> 0:1:36,119
are you doing your job we have nothing
from you as she cited daniels the


30
0:1:36,119 --> 0:1:39,24
powerful loss of the control of the
currency in which a dash in or the


31
0:1:39,24 --> 0:1:42,21
federal reserve board of governors and
these are supposed to be really good


32
0:1:42,21 --> 0:1:44,66
banks now let's watch what happens


33
0:1:44,66 --> 0:1:46,329
you know have evidence


34
0:1:46,329 --> 0:1:48,36
in your files


35
0:1:48,36 --> 0:1:53,59
all of the illegal activity i'd take it
for some of these banks


36
0:1:53,59 --> 0:1:56,77
it's affair really wants to bring a
lawsuit


37
0:1:56,77 --> 0:2:1,27
you're both lawyers would it be helpful
if you're going against one of these


38
0:2:1,27 --> 0:2:5,3
people banks would it be helpful for
these families


39
0:2:5,3 --> 0:2:8,669
to have the information about their case


40
0:2:8,669 --> 0:2:10,889
that's in your finals


41
0:2:10,889 --> 0:2:12,369
possession


42
0:2:12,369 --> 0:2:13,809
it would uh...


43
0:2:13,809 --> 0:2:17,829
you would be helpful obviously there
have been for mation related to be


44
0:2:17,829 --> 0:2:20,189
entering that should work


45
0:2:20,189 --> 0:2:20,959
so


46
0:2:20,959 --> 0:2:23,859
do you plan to give the families


47
0:2:23,859 --> 0:2:25,879
this information


48
0:2:25,879 --> 0:2:28,459
i think that's a decision that we're
still considering we haven't made a


49
0:2:28,459 --> 0:2:30,149
final decision yet


50
0:2:30,149 --> 0:2:33,759
so you have made a decision to protect
the banks but not a decision to tell the


51
0:2:33,759 --> 0:2:37,779
families who were illegally foreclosed
against


52
0:2:37,779 --> 0:2:40,719
we have made a decision about when
information we will provide the


53
0:2:40,719 --> 0:2:43,849
individuals


54
0:2:43,849 --> 0:2:44,8
mistress to pune


55
0:2:44,8 --> 0:2:46,609
receptionist


56
0:2:46,609 --> 0:2:49,4
the embarrassment that he had in that


57
0:2:49,4 --> 0:2:50,48
like split-second


58
0:2:50,48 --> 0:2:54,719
at the end at the end yet latrines gonna
crimea like uh...


59
0:2:54,719 --> 0:2:57,789
that was officer was under which


60
0:2:57,789 --> 0:3:1,279
shane that's what was that's exactly
right


61
0:3:1,279 --> 0:3:3,119
and he had the same insecure


62
0:3:3,119 --> 0:3:6,159
you're right now we have protected the
banks


63
0:3:6,159 --> 0:3:9,879
we have not given the information that
they needed to


64
0:3:9,879 --> 0:3:11,559
to protect the consumers


65
0:3:11,559 --> 0:3:15,759
who were the victims yes you're right
that's exactly what we've done


66
0:3:15,759 --> 0:3:19,469
the exact opposite of what we were
trying to appeal it's great to see it


67
0:3:19,469 --> 0:3:22,589
was before doing this you know we talked
about this uh... leaving before the show


68
0:3:22,589 --> 0:3:25,459
because back in february she went out
the regulators as you


69
0:3:25,459 --> 0:3:28,689
as you mentioned the plot all the court
that the other course grade


70
0:3:28,689 --> 0:3:35,49
also is there was a e described as a top
executive atop for banking executive


71
0:3:35,49 --> 0:3:36,499
emailed


72
0:3:36,499 --> 0:3:37,869
to pull it off


73
0:3:37,869 --> 0:3:41,709
uh... well and said well senator warner
never write cast pointed questions of


74
0:3:41,709 --> 0:3:43,9
today's the senate banking committee
hearing


75
0:3:43,9 --> 0:3:47,139
proclaim that nobody believes that bank
books


76
0:3:47,139 --> 0:3:49,759
are honest is just plain wrong


77
0:3:49,759 --> 0:3:53,199
perhaps someone on a reminder senator
that the campaign is over


78
0:3:53,199 --> 0:3:55,11
and she should act accordingly


79
0:3:55,11 --> 0:3:57,489
if she wants to be taken to


80
0:3:57,489 --> 0:4:0,979
venue of civil right for bring that
quote back


81
0:4:0,979 --> 0:4:5,469
right there and not shows the
expectation in washington


82
0:4:5,469 --> 0:4:9,709
you run progressive during the campaign
ofcourse we understand your trick people


83
0:4:9,709 --> 0:4:11,369
into getting their votes


84
0:4:11,369 --> 0:4:15,409
almost elections over if you want to be
taken seriously


85
0:4:15,409 --> 0:4:19,719
you come back into the fold and you do
with the corporations the banks wanted


86
0:4:19,719 --> 0:4:22,309
yet because what is being taken
seriously


87
0:4:22,309 --> 0:4:24,52
has to be taken seriously meanest


88
0:4:24,52 --> 0:4:26,339
you want us to support


89
0:4:26,339 --> 0:4:30,429
you are still close some of our money to
you you want us to you want to be in the


90
0:4:30,429 --> 0:4:31,979
crowd that were or


91
0:4:31,979 --> 0:4:34,37
and or worst or we have a target


92
0:4:34,37 --> 0:4:36,709
natalie attorneys try to get you out


93
0:4:36,709 --> 0:4:41,99
three days a civilization she definitely
being taken seriously by


94
0:4:41,99 --> 0:4:41,93
that's right


95
0:4:41,93 --> 0:4:44,16
yet that's that's why people lover right


96
0:4:44,16 --> 0:4:47,43
and and what he's also saying
anticipating plus a part of washington


97
0:4:47,43 --> 0:4:48,61
is


98
0:4:48,61 --> 0:4:50,419
that you're in that committee


99
0:4:50,419 --> 0:4:52,439
would you like to be the head of
activity


100
0:4:52,439 --> 0:4:55,869
now understand that you go along being
unserious like this you have no chance


101
0:4:55,869 --> 0:4:57,25
of being evacuated


102
0:4:57,25 --> 0:4:58,3
now the house is it


103
0:4:58,3 --> 0:5:2,729
the greatest example this was the house
ways and means committee at that


104
0:5:2,729 --> 0:5:5,309
one point the democrat intro to the
steps down


105
0:5:5,309 --> 0:5:8,719
uh... was charlie rangel exceed the
september's revelations an excellent


106
0:5:8,719 --> 0:5:12,759
seniority was pete stark possibly the
most progressive member of the house


107
0:5:12,759 --> 0:5:14,409
carefully right


108
0:5:14,409 --> 0:5:16,74
and that was you know the couple years
ago


109
0:5:16,74 --> 0:5:19,24
and i said others know where they're
going to make peace smart the head of


110
0:5:19,24 --> 0:5:22,63
the most powerful committee in the house
be stars a relevent


111
0:5:22,63 --> 0:5:23,83
he lasted


112
0:5:23,83 --> 0:5:25,229
one day


113
0:5:25,229 --> 0:5:27,309
literally one day


114
0:5:27,309 --> 0:5:29,9
and he was made to step down


115
0:5:29,9 --> 0:5:32,59
give uh... it's a i'm not right for this
role


116
0:5:32,59 --> 0:5:37,27
and it'd this place was put someone
friendly the corporate interests so


117
0:5:37,27 --> 0:5:40,39
that's what they mean by you want to be
taken seriously are you wanna be like he


118
0:5:40,39 --> 0:5:42,51
starts on a serious very soon


119
0:5:42,51 --> 0:5:46,139
but what is the level last even if it is
absolutely his job


120
0:5:46,139 --> 0:5:50,629
under seniority rules under every rule
lonely less one day


121
0:5:50,629 --> 0:5:53,94
and now for most senators on friday that
the committee on


122
0:5:53,94 --> 0:5:57,81
cut back the powerful and by the way
also more donations cuz


123
0:5:57,81 --> 0:5:59,889
well doesn't have a committee is more
donations


124
0:5:59,889 --> 0:6:3,23
more likely to get reelected as a but
they don't know what it dealing with


125
0:6:3,23 --> 0:6:6,25
here are the rules of the bargains that
damages ahead of activity


126
0:6:6,25 --> 0:6:7,62
if she's got a sellout


127
0:6:7,62 --> 0:6:10,81
to be the head of the committee what
obama was elected in the senate two


128
0:6:10,81 --> 0:6:13,719
thousand four eight two thousand two
thousand lives are in


129
0:6:13,719 --> 0:6:15,74
als with warren was


130
0:6:15,74 --> 0:6:19,749
uh... was elections just elected board


131
0:6:19,749 --> 0:6:23,289
so twenty two thousand four two thousand
eight obama rent two thousand eight moon


132
0:6:23,289 --> 0:6:27,269
an experienced senator fourier sir and
point sixty


133
0:6:27,269 --> 0:6:28,619
chiller for your sister


134
0:6:28,619 --> 0:6:32,33
well i'll tell you what every progress
in the country would be


135
0:6:32,33 --> 0:6:36,44
just beside themselves in in excitement
if that happens right


136
0:6:36,44 --> 0:6:39,68
and hillary clinton wouldn't talk about
the liquid


137
0:6:39,68 --> 0:6:43,89
made wing blurry gasoline clinton


138
0:6:43,89 --> 0:6:45,499
happened five years ago six years ago


139
0:6:45,499 --> 0:6:47,16
because she was to establish


140
0:6:47,16 --> 0:6:50,8
so that when she got less establishment
since then


141
0:6:50,8 --> 0:6:52,849
so well this is a possibility that we
were wrong


142
0:6:52,849 --> 0:6:57,4
no no no no we don't act look i think
him we were never on retroactive


143
0:6:57,4 --> 0:7:1,85
resentful about about that offers a
resume or or the other although it won't


144
0:7:1,85 --> 0:7:5,64
be there but we will win by the wrong
about who was more staff yeah jack


145
0:7:5,64 --> 0:7:7,24
genessee last right


146
0:7:7,24 --> 0:7:10,1
but that's it while lighthouses damning
with faint


147
0:7:10,1 --> 0:7:14,49
free praised what one more from was with
one of your christian identity massive


148
0:7:14,49 --> 0:7:17,5
has restricted the street freely skit


149
0:7:17,5 --> 0:7:18,979
pennies on the dollar


150
0:7:18,979 --> 0:7:20,729
in the settlement


151
0:7:20,729 --> 0:7:25,31
for having been the victims illegal
activities or mistakes in the banks


152
0:7:25,31 --> 0:7:27,66
activities


153
0:7:27,66 --> 0:7:32,819
do you like the banks and inhuman el
nino individual cases where the banks


154
0:7:32,819 --> 0:7:36,94
violated the law and you're not going to
tell the homeland's or at least it's not


155
0:7:36,94 --> 0:7:39,34
clear yet whether not you're going to do
that


156
0:7:39,34 --> 0:7:41,719
we have in their decision will bring
some homeowners


157
0:7:41,719 --> 0:7:43,55
people want to know


158
0:7:43,55 --> 0:7:49,79
that they're regulators are watching l
for the american public not the banks


159
0:7:49,79 --> 0:7:53,36
and the only way that we can evaluate
whether or not you're doing your job


160
0:7:53,36 --> 0:7:57,65
is if you make some of this information
publicly available


161
0:7:57,65 --> 0:8:0,149
so far you're not doing that


162
0:8:0,149 --> 0:8:4,49
and without transparency we can't have
any confidence


163
0:8:4,49 --> 0:8:6,839
either in new york oversight


164
0:8:6,839 --> 0:8:11,119
or at the markets are functioning
properly handle


165
0:8:11,119 --> 0:8:16,1
water looked like a pilot lecture i said
what are we talking about why not


166
0:8:16,1 --> 0:8:19,8
it's interesting the use of the
conference because she is the opposite


167
0:8:19,8 --> 0:8:21,65
of all bombing how she's handled the
first time


168
0:8:21,65 --> 0:8:25,299
present no model went with the hillary
clinton uh...


169
0:8:25,299 --> 0:8:26,48
it keep your head down


170
0:8:26,48 --> 0:8:31,16
don't ever do anything don't challenge a
bush say things that i was like out can


171
0:8:31,16 --> 0:8:34,95
you believe that bush is so bad let's
get changed but don't introduce any


172
0:8:34,95 --> 0:8:39,74
legislation don't you know don't speak
out in committee hearings shot up bright


173
0:8:39,74 --> 0:8:42,579
and it didn't work for you know right or
wrong to work for


174
0:8:42,579 --> 0:8:43,46
he say


175
0:8:43,46 --> 0:8:47,23
issues now wild sheep i mean it's a
pretty good i mean she's so let me know


176
0:8:47,23 --> 0:8:52,52
if you don't know threat over the world
right itself but on it


177
0:8:52,52 --> 0:8:55,79
in terms of what she serious or not
place she says because


178
0:8:55,79 --> 0:8:58,41
she does not go wade into territory


179
0:8:58,41 --> 0:8:59,6
but she's not


180
0:8:59,6 --> 0:9:4,8
totally well person so she's not going
into other committees like guns blazing


181
0:9:4,8 --> 0:9:7,769
its acrobat botswana for back pain


182
0:9:7,769 --> 0:9:9,39
scene no was this


183
0:9:9,39 --> 0:9:12,959
and nobody knows a better than her and
she if she knows it she's missing of


184
0:9:12,959 --> 0:9:14,65
course and stick my head up


185
0:9:14,65 --> 0:9:17,52
that's why i got elected the whole point
was to represent people


186
0:9:17,52 --> 0:9:19,199
and about let him get away with it


187
0:9:19,199 --> 0:9:23,889
so she's gone with that strategy and and
i think that it's obviously having serai


188
0:9:23,889 --> 0:9:24,839
strategy


189
0:9:24,839 --> 0:9:26,54
and obviously as you point out


190
0:9:26,54 --> 0:9:29,45
four years is not too short a period of
time


191
0:9:29,45 --> 0:11:29,45
so up it out
