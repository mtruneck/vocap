###16 STEFAN RUIZ: For me, what I've always been interested in is
###19 this contrast between rich and poor, between--
###23 just the craziness of the world.
###24 How different people live different ways.
###27 People are the same.
###28 People are different.
###30 But just to try to photograph, in a similar way, all these
###34 different things, and let them speak for themselves.
###37 
###50 I would say people think of me as a portrait photographer--
###53 Well, no.
###54 It's weird.
###54 Because some people think of me as a portrait photographer.
###57 Other people think of me as a landscape travel photographer.
###62 So I kind of like that, because they
###64 don't always cross.
###65 I think in the States, especially, I'm considered
###69 this third world photographer, who photographs down and outs
###73 or something.
###74 I don't really know.
###75 I do tons of celebrity portraits for the Sunday
###79 newspaper magazines in the UK.
###81 I photographed James Brown for them.
###84 I photographed P Diddy.
###86 Liza Minnelli.
###87 I don't know.
###87 All kinds of people.
###89 I'm still pretty shy, but I was really shy.
###92 And for me to meet people, or do anything, the good thing
###96 with photography, and working for magazines, or just
###99 travelling and going on these things was I was thrown into
###102 these situations where I just had to deal.
###106 And I like that.
###106 And I like the fact that I get sent places, and from one week
###110 to the next, I'm not really sure who I'm going to meet,
###112 where I'm going to go.
###113 And I'll do advertising.
###116 I'll do my own stuff.
###117 I'll do portraits of celebrities, or poor people,
###121 or I'll do some kind of documentary thing.
###123 And for me, it's always interesting.
###126 
###132 I'm definitely a hoarder, a collector.
###135 It runs in the family.
###136 My mom is a crazy hoarder.
###140 It's so hard for me to throw anything away.
###142 But at the same time, I travel all the time, and I've gotten
###145 quite good at going places and buying things that you can't
###149 really find in other places, or it's
###151 harder to, or whatever.
###153 I buy photographs.
###155 I buy things that I think are weird I buy anything
###159 portrait-based.
###160 Cups.
###160 I don't know.
###161 I bought five jockey coffee mugs the other day, because
###165 they're portraits of jockeys.
###167 It's just retarded.
###169 I like this one, because he's kind of like Burt Reynolds.
###171 I don't know why I collect portraits.
###174 I think that portraits just kind of work, aesthetically.
###177 Some of this is from Mexico, South Africa.
###180 I've got my Pablo Escobars.
###182 We've got Robin Hood, and him as a businessman or a Senator,
###185 and then him casual.
###187 They're made by a guy in [INAUDIBLE].
###190 This is from Mexico.
###190 These are some of my favorite types of photographs.
###193 These are these carved old photographs.
###195 I've got a bunch of them.
###196 They're really fragile.
###198 A lot of them are really old.
###200 These are photos I bought in Egypt.
###202 So these are Egypt in the '70s.
###205 Yeah, they're hand-colored from the '70s.
###208 They got a little wild there in the end.
###210 But I'm into studio photography.
###215 I got this in Colombia.
###217 I think it's a photographer's advertisement for his skills.
###223 I like this one.
###224 We have the butt.
###226 We have the beer being poured.
###228 I like that one.
###231 Or that.
###233 What else?
###235 I collect records as well.
###237 This is Gal Costa.
###239 I also like this one, though.
###241 This is one of my favorites of the moment right now.
###244 The salsa is my law, really.
###249 This is Patrick, trusted assistant for years now.
###254 I'm from San Francisco.
###256 I went to university in Santa Cruz.
###258 I studied drawing and painting, and I got into
###261 photography kind of by accident.
###263 I worked for a professor of mine in Northeast Ivory Coast.
###271 That first trip, I didn't consider myself a
###274 photographer.
###275 I liked taking pictures, but I just wanted to travel.
###277 I think that's how I got into photography.
###280 The first photos I took were actually there.
###282 I went back to California.
###284 I had no money.
###285 I got a job in a bar.
###287 And while I was working in the restaurant, I was also
###291 teaching drawing and painting at San Quentin, at the prison.
###297 And then I really wanted to take pictures of them, so I
###300 started taking all these photos.
###302 And then I put this whole little notebook together.
###306 And I would carry this box.
###308 This was before laptops, everything.
###310 Maybe I'd changed boxes at one point, but this
###313 is basically it.
###316 I used to bring this to Europe with me all the time.
###320 And then I would show this, and this is how I'd get jobs.
###326 So these are a couple of guys from my class.
###330 5150s, clinically insane.
###334 So these are all from the early '90s, I'd say.
###339 In London, you'd always have meetings in the pub.
###341 And as I'd get more and more drunk, eventually I would
###345 start showing my photos to people.
###346 And one of the guys, he started doing "Caterpillar."
###351 And he basically hired me to do photos like my photos from
###356 the prison for caterpillar.
###358 That's when I first started really making some money, and
###361 start figuring, maybe I could make a living at photography.
###365 The guy I worked with on "Caterpillar," he started
###368 working at "Camper." And then he hired me for the first
###372 campaign he did there.
###374 And I did six campaigns with "Camper." He wanted something
###377 a little bit quirky, and he gave us a lot of freedom.
###382 Tons of freedom.
###382 It seemed like we could do anything we wanted.
###385 And then, when I was probably on the fifth or sixth campaign
###388 for "Camper," I was asked to be creative director at
###393 "Colors."
###394 "Colors" was this magazine that took things, and each
###397 issue had a theme.
###398 Whether it was war, or whatever.
###400 And instead of doing a type of documentary photography that
###404 was probably seen a lot at that time, we were trying to
###407 do a more polished image of this thing.
###410 Not artificial, but just, maybe, well-lit,
###414 well-composed, hopefully respect.
###417 Quite interesting to look at.
###419 I'd take the same equipment I would take to photograph some
###422 celebrity, I would take on my ad jobs.
###425 And I would set it up pretty much the same way.
###428 But you're photographing a refugee, or
###430 maybe a doctor or something.
###432 Not necessarily a stolen moment.
###434 Something that is about participation.
###438 Where the sitter has to participate in
###440 the photo as well.
###441 You're not just taking something from them.
###443 Kind of like this negotiation or something.
###445 
###449 You have to work with the person.
###450 
###453 Some of these are my own projects,
###455 and then other stuff.
###457 The telenovelas series is something that is definitely
###460 important to me.
###462 The telenovela project started with "Colors." The idea of
###466 doing a whole issue on soap operas in Mexico City came up.
###471 I thought they were interesting, because so many
###473 people watched them, because it's kind of like there's
###476 these unattainable dreams for the people watching them.
###480 But there's all these social and political things that are
###483 behind it and in it.
###485 You're dealing with things like with money, with race,
###488 with these Cinderella stories.
###492 Part of it was also because half my family's from Mexico.
###495 And my family came across the border illegally.
###499 They were poor, trying to better themselves, whatever.
###502 Trying to get this dream.
###505 It all kind of made sense to me in that way.
###508 I've been shooting in Mexico a lot of over the years, and
###511 tomorrow I'm going back to shoot, but
###513 to start a new project.
###515 I'm going to Mexico tomorrow, so I'm packing now.
###518 I'll probably throw my clothes in with the tripod and stuff.
###521 I travel with this, the lights.
###523 Some light stands here.
###525 This is the camera I use.
###526 It's a great camera.
###528 These are film holders.
###530 This film here goes in there.
###534 And that's kind of it.
###536 And all my spare Mexican pesos.
###539 
###584 OK.
###585 So we just got here in Monterrey.
###588 I've been to a lot of places in Mexico, but not here.
###592 We came to Monterrey, Mexico to do a shoot on the fashion
###596 and hairstyle of these kids who listen to a lot of
###599 vallenato and cumbia from Columbia.
###603 They call themselves Colombians, but they're not
###604 Colombians.
###605 They're from Mexico, and particularly,
###608 they're from Monterrey.
###609 I don't know.
###610 They've been called "Cholombians."
###617 With that like documentary-style portrait,
###621 you're really dependent on the people showing up.
###623 And a lot of times, they don't show up.
###625 Because they don't know you, and they don't really--
###627 I think you've got to bring yourself to them.
###630 So first, we went to the market, where they buy music,
###633 and they can buy videos, shirts, hats, trinkets,
###637 Colombian things, Colombian pictures.
###640 They buy this, and it's kind of a gathering point.
###642 They sell a lot of bootleg films, and there seems to be a
###648 little brothel behind where we are shooting.
###651 
###656 I didn't want to shoot them, necessarily, with all the
###659 grime and stuff, like, say, in the market.
###662 I wanted to keep the image clean.
###664 Because they're interesting enough on their own, and I
###666 think the background would just distract.
###669 I wasn't trying to make some kind of social statement about
###672 where they live, or about anything like that.
###674 It's more about them and their style.
###677 
###682 I still shoot mostly with the 4x5.
###684 Almost only.
###685 My camera is made in Germany.
###688 It's a Linhof.
###690 I'm like this dinosaur.
###690 I get hired on ad jobs to use my 4x5, and then the art
###695 directors are like, wow, I haven't seen one of
###696 those in a long time.
###698 They're really slow, though.
###699 Sometimes I hate my camera.
###700 But it's great at the same time.
###703 I guess the thing was, I was never really a 35 millimeter
###707 kind of war photographer style, like run around, shoot.
###712 Snap, snap, snap.
###714 Different angles and stuff.
###716 Since I did do painting, and since I was used to setting up
###719 compositions, I felt more comfortable with that.
###722 Still trying to figure out my framing here.
###725 I've never really been into the idea of trying to convince
###728 someone to do a photo by giving them money.
###730 I think it creates kind of a weird dynamic.
###732 So my way around that, a lot of times, has been to just
###736 shoot Polaroids, and give them Polaroids.
###738 
###744 So I'm giving him the one he likes the most.
###747 And keep a few for myself, so I can work out what I'm doing.
###750 I can critique how this shoot's going.
###753 
###758 I will also show them what I'm doing.
###760 I think it builds a sense of trust, if they look at the
###763 Polaroid and they see what I'm doing.
###765 They show it to their friends.
###767 Their friends get interested, their friends want pictures.
###771 We just got our first shot, about five or six guys.
###775 Tonight we're going to a party, and if all goes well,
###779 we'll be working pretty fast, and we'll
###781 get quite a bit done.
###782 
###787 Obviously, people are hearing a lot about Mexico these days
###790 for violence and drugs.
###792 I've been coming here fairly often, and I've never really
###795 had bad experiences so far.
###797 But you can tell that there's some tension here.
###800 We knew of some concerts, and we were going to try to shoot
###803 in these clubs, but when we asked for permission, the
###806 owner said no, because a lot of gangsters or narcos hang
###811 out in these places.
###811 They said it's quite dangerous for us.
###813 That at least we'd get beat up, if not worse.
###816 And they also said that the kids probably stay away from
###819 there more now.
###820 So we went out to the suburbs.
###823 We went to a club called Lone Star.
###825 And basically, that had tons of these kids there.
###829 They are quite young.
###830 They seem to be all mostly teenagers.
###833 And basically, they dance around in circles.
###836 It all seems pretty mellow, actually.
###840 PATRICK: The way Stefan shoots is we always do kind of a
###843 portable photo studio.
###845 We try to find a wall, usually.
###847 But this one has too much texture to it.
###850 So we want to keep it simple.
###852 STEFAN RUIZ: I've shot a lot of times outside clubs, or all
###857 over the place.
###857 I'm quite used to doing this.
###859 I like doing it.
###860 
###867 I'll often let the person pose themselves.
###869 I'll compose it the way I like, but I often want them to
###873 present themselves.
###874 Whether it is a refugee, or someone who's insane, or some
###879 politician.
###880 
###882 When I was, I think, 16, my parents got divorced.
###886 And my dad was a lawyer.
###888 My mom was an art teacher.
###890 She wanted to go to Italy, because her family was from
###892 Italy, and she wanted to go there.
###894 And we went and lived in Florence.
###898 At that point, I totally didn't like Renaissance
###901 painting or anything.
###903 I finally got into a school, like a high school.
###905 An art high school.
###907 And so I had to copy all these famous paintings.
###909 I had to copy famous sculptures.
###911 And by the end of year, I actually started getting quite
###914 into Renaissance art.
###915 I especially like the older portraits and stuff.
###918 And I like Flemish painting a lot, too.
###921 I would say that's a huge influence in my portraiture.
###923 
###934 So we got quite a few people that night.
###936 Maybe 20?
###937 I don't know.
###938 We stayed there until about 3:00 in the morning.
###943 Yesterday, we photographed downtown.
###947 There's a 7-Eleven that's below a radio station.
###951 All of the Cholombianos, they hang out there.
###953 
###967 We went there.
###968 We just picked some of the guys, asked them.
###970 And if they're into it, then we set up a little studio
###974 around the block.
###975 And yeah.
###976 I think we got a lot of good things.
###978 
###980 At the end of the day, I think that work should work on a lot
###984 of different levels.
###984 It should be interesting to look at.
###986 It should be technically well-done.
###988 The subject itself, hopefully it's got a political thing.
###992 Maybe the photo makes you think about something.
###994 Maybe it's not just eye candy.
###996 It's not just a one idea thing.
###1001 All right.
###1002 I think we're done.
###1004 I think I'm going to be really happy with this shoot.
###1006 I think these guys are pretty genius.
###1008 And just by taking time to document their style, I think
###1017 I'll be really happy with it.
###1018
