###0 that there are many redundant forms of communication
###3 and once communication is set up
###6 the survivors discovered the cold
###9 although resistance movement
###17 over your life
###19 but
###27 melbourne red-baiting hungry tattered that steve crude from the surviving
###33 remnants of a devastated make sure it for
###36 because the boulders bernhard is running
###39 what are your network heard about the bull run
###42 you know i've heard landed at all began
###46 victory was very much in doubt
###49 again we are back
###51 there will be doable david
###54 but i have happily competent we will have been
###59 survival
###60 is only a first step
###65 humanity must band together
###69 and fight
###72 there are
###85 deleon harvesters script
###94 but for perth survivors
###96 the terrifying harvest
###99 becomes an opportunity
###103 well the biggest problems with fighting
###105 would be getting inside the technology
###109 revolving
###110 orleans resting
###112 they've got the shield
###114 figure out a way to get insider shield
###117 in your life to have a lot more effective damage
###121 but there's a simple
###123 using the aliens own technology
###128 the alien scripture
###131 becomes attract
###156 the
###161 caa
###164 there
###171 how
###175 how hot
###178 the human resistance has scored a victory
###182 it's a small one but it brings hope
###186 three hours
###189 these military tactics are important strategic part of the plan to fight
###194 indian innovation
###197 we're back again with your time
###199 grilling gate warfare before we have faith
###203 risque computer gets t_v_ and high tech
###207 so survivors must fight them with www tech
###213 the plan to resist the aliens is based on history
###217 wars from the american revolution to the iraq campaign
###221 tactics and small-scale explosives
###224 held leveled the playing field for a technologically inferior fighting force
###231 lots of little blows into as much damage is
###233 as one big word generally speaking
###237 lots and lots of little bloated much more psychological damage
###244 military strategists have a name for this approach
###249 a symmetric warfare
###251 i'm in a bit of a question of course war default
###254 does this become more and more than technology
###258 for those of the come a long drawn-out the insurrection area campaign
###262 we can cut by him
###264 the same way in the same organization that he's used to fighting
###267 he's probably got it features
###270 so even if i could orville disconnected his soft spots his commander control no
###274 to this was just too close
###276 you've got a attack when it's not expected
###281 today one of the greatest experts in a symmetric warfare
###286 is also one of the largest defense departments in the world
###290 the pentagon
###293 paperwork
###295 the hard way
###299 our military has had
###301 at this point by nine year
###304 hard core class
###306 on how to be insurgents
###308 they've been fighting for nine years
###312 in iraq
###313 and afghanistan
###316 america's overwhelming firepower can sometimes to feed it with a simple
###321 roadside bombs
###324 to low-tech mein type of weapon
###326 but it causes concern among state technological poor status can't find
###329 officially casual user occurring
###332 furor when it's going to happen where it's going to happen
###335 so it has a wearing down effect on me up early portions
###343 the insurgents also change their tactics regularly any new idea is always good
###350 as the first time we use it
###352 they got a barrage explosive devices when they first argues nose and mouth
###355 the iraqi a war
###357 they used the doorbell buzzers
###360 cellphone ringers and we would figure out how they were doing that they would
###363 switch to something else
###366 they would use radio communications than they would switch to something else
###371 the strategies are effective
###374 into thousand eight
###376 seventy percent of american deaths were from improvised explosive devices
###382 one method the pentagon users to create contra strategies to such a deadly
###387 attacks
###388 decision team
###391 a war game
###395 america's military finance its tactics based on computer simulations and
###400 teachers wargames
###402 these are often highly classified projects using some of the most powerful
###406 computers in the world
###410 these computers sooner
###411 resource helped establish america strategies protocol around the world
###418 when travis steelers computer simulation is running for interviewing an invasion
###422 boarding scenario
###424 the warranty short
###426 bikini and swim
###429 everytime
###430 sometimes within an hour
###433 but when the time frame of the war game is extended from deeds to here's
###439 the results change
###442 in the long run
###444 is all about it you can kill them faster
###446 then they can replace their troops
###449 then you can chip away at that spellman whittle that down
###454 i mean you can overwhelm
###459 these wargames form the basis of the plan for a indian resistance
###472 it's a simple rule of guru warfare
###477 small attacks on a constant pieces keeps the war going on
###486 six months of observation has also uncovered a critical characteristic of
###490 the invaders
###494 their numbers aren't increasing
###501 forces had mentioned true far from
###503 to rely on reinforcements
###506 that means every lost unit
###508 be replaced
###510 and that's a pretty ron
###513 the computer simulation now favors
###520 the winner of a war is what is the largest population in and could be
###524 aliens
###525 here are two years ago we used to be a more aliens here too but the mother
###529 we might end up
###531 in a numbers game
###533 thrust
###536 students can take lessons on survival from the most populous creatures on
###540 earth
###543 pants
###545 and societies
###547 and those of other social insects are decentralize there's no central leader
###551 or police worth the rules get sent out and uh... this is a real smart way of
###556 organizing society's it's very hard to fight
###560 not hard for full systems like annette calling so you can kill all the and she
###564 want in your kitchen
###566 and it's probably not going to matter to the caller ip all
###572 banding together helps keep the individual lives
###575 and keeping the groups small in separate
###578 helps make the human species less vulnerable to extinction than it is
###582 obvious that yes
###584 the goal is not too and i believe
###587 powerful invader it's to make him want to leave
###591 or really have to is figure out a way to hold out much longer
###596 hopefully
###597 bills that have been too busy part of this day
###599 billowed up their bags please
###602 the strategy always to bring the battle to the enemy
###607 no weapon is off limits
###610 including what may be good
###611 deadliest of what's left in the arsenal
###617 the human body
###631 time may be running short for grad school armies
###636 and the entire planet
###645 the alien newcomers are what biologists call
###649 invasive species
###653 than invasive species as one that moves into an area that's never previously
###658 occupied
###660 and disrupts the local ecology
###664 as successful invasive species is
###666 could it moving around
###668 and disrupting the landscape usually through aggressive behavior
###672 which can be there for fighting or just domination of space
###677 once
###678 the suspension system
###685 case in point
###687 fire ants in the american south
###691 these stealing resume in the past first came to america on a single cargo ship
###696 in nineteen thirty
###698 they began to spread
###700 conquering every other camps species in their path
###703 these amps actually kill off
###706 every other empathic and scattered reload mandible salon
###711 invasive and sweep over the landscape producer away and there's no evidence
###714 that they back off
###718 today
###719 fire ants are found from maryland to california
###723 history does change forever once abrasive species comes up
###731 now
###732 the bands of human guerrillas hope to drive off the invasive aliens
###737 before they transform the environment of our planet to their poll meets
###744 one way to fight an invasive species
###747 is to create more of the local species
###751 the war against the in the invasion will mean
###757 if we're gonna create a long-term resistance were up to change our talked
###761 about what's except born culture and society
###765 if there's a female bits of birthing a change in these big break with his meany
###770 children as you possibly can
###772 so there might be fertility drugs in houston
###776 a breeding program will require multiple makes
###782 more children
###783 will require multiple pregnancies
###786 anyone not pregnant
###788 becomes a warrior
###790 mail or female
###794 human being that's at the age of say fourteen or older would need to be
###798 carrying a weapon
###799 we have to create a
###801 total resistance
###803 every human being that's a lot
###806 but the economy may be hard to find
###810 birth survivors have noted that
###812 decide robots aircraft
###815 unsaid ever appeared outside their craft
###818 perhaps they
###820 through technology
###822 has a very good reason that i am
###824 wouldn't want to get outside of his character wanted lana leah
###827 discussion realized pledged g wellesley rises novel war the world's
###832 muscle the folks that are pledging an atmospheric bolbo combat scarier and
###837 diseases of wallop in the classic u
###843 aliens are destroyed by the
###844 cheerio thought could science-fiction hold the key for proof survivors
###850 could bacterium or of violence to support her attackers
###855 viruses
###856 in a particular have death
###858 the balkan engage with organic greens that he bobbing its head
###864 maybe we could table about lodging web in contract those they do it
###870 their dreams and for developed to fight against that provide
###876 bacteria and disney's current rampant among survivors deprived of antibiotics
###881 and other matters
###883 now
###884 some of the sick and dying turning their illness into a weapon
###890 biological soon decide bombers
###894 self-sacrifice isn't just a human trait
###898 it's a natural survival mechanism when a species
