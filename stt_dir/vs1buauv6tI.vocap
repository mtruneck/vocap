###26 PETER HEWITT: It's been a while since I've been here,
###28 but I seem to remember it's a nice little ride.
###31 There's all kinds of stuff out there.
###33 I've seen porpoise, there's orcas swimming around.
###36 I just saw a bald eagle right over there.
###38 AARON MEZA: Really?

###78 PATRICK O'DELL: What's up?
###79 We're on the ferry heading to Orcas Island.
###81 There's a really good park there.
###83 And everyone's going to skate.
###84 This the second demo of the trip.
###87 It's been like a week and a half so far,
###88 but only two demos.
###89 There's three demos total.
###90 I don't know if it'll be crowded because
###92 it's hard to get to.
###93 But it's going to be big.
###94 Because everyone's really amped to skate it.
###96 There's camping.
###97 We're going to camp for a couple days on the island.
###99 We got to do like a long hike to get there.
###101 And I don't know, I'm pretty excited.
###106 MALE SPEAKER: Oh!
###107 That's so beautiful, dude.
###108 
###113 Come on, little birdies.
###115 Come on, pelican.
###117 Oh, you got it, you got it, you got it!
###118 
###121 One of them's going to come in hard on you dude.
###123 
###159 MALE SPEAKER: Whoa!
###162 ROBBIE RUSSO: It's a good day for flying a kite.
###164 
###176 RICK HOWARD: Wow.
###177 Robbie!
###178 
###181 He's going to get it, this guy.
###184 AARON MEZA: Is that your wizard stick?
###185 
###188 MALE SPEAKER: Man, yours is weak.
###190 MIKE CARROLL: I just started, barely.
###191 
###195 AARON MEZA: Is there always a cup at the bottom?
###197 MIKE CARROLL: Well, I had another cup, and I was going
###199 to try to put them together.
###200 Couple people said it's not fair or it's against
###203 regulation.
###204 
###210 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, whoa, whoa.
###212 
###221 Epicly faded.
###223 Epicly O'Douled.
###225 
###230 AARON MEZA: Brian.
###232 Did you just puke?
###235 Are you all right, Brian?
###237 That looked all red.
###237 BRIAN ANDERSON: I'll be all right.
###239 It was red, huh?
###240 AARON MEZA: Yeah, it looked like blood.
###242 Like I was freaked out.
###244 BRIAN ANDERSON: Yeah, let's look at it.
###248 Does that look like blood?
###250 AARON MEZA: What did you eat?
###252 BRIAN ANDERSON: I don't know, dude.
###254 
###259 MALE SPEAKER: You did puke up blood?
###261 BRIAN ANDERSON: I don't know.
###262 MALE SPEAKER: Did you have anything, like Powerades to
###264 drink or anything?
###265 BRIAN ANDERSON: I probably did, yeah.
###266 MALE SPEAKER: Put the light on it again?
###267 TONY MIORANA: Yeah.
###269 Beer, blood.
###271 AARON MEZA: Looked really red coming out of there.
###273 TONY MIORANA: OK.
###274 MALE SPEAKER: It's not thick enough to be blood, though.
###278 Beer blood?
###278 MALE SPEAKER: That's what she said.
###279 AARON MEZA: Hey TMo, tell me about your wizard stick
###282 TONY MIORANA: OK.
###284 The wizard stick's probably-- this is my first
###285 one I've ever done.
###286 But this tells exactly where you are in the night.
###289 You can walk with anyone, they can see how many heights they
###293 got, or how many cans they got down.
###294 And if they're a real wizard.
###295 If they're not a wizard, you're like, yeah, you only
###298 got four cans?
###299 Not worthy of even hanging out with.
###301 Why would I even talk to you right now, waste my time.
###303 I'm a real wizard.
###304 AARON MEZA: So how many beers until it's
###306 official wizard status?
###307 TONY MIORANA: Your height.
###308 You can just cross it out in front of your tent and say,
###311 don't cross this path.
###312 There's a drunk wizard in here.
###313 Why would you mess with a drunk wizard?
###315 
###324 MALE SPEAKER: Regulation.
###325 AARON MEZA: Regulation what?
###327 MALE SPEAKER: Regulation tape size to the can.
###328 MALE SPEAKER: Can't waste the tape.
###329 MALE SPEAKER: That shit's expensive.
###331 Just duct tape, baby.
###333 MIKE CARROLL: Can't waste the tape.
###334 AARON MEZA: Preston, are you a wizard yet?
###336 PRESTON: Nope.
###338 I'm an inch below.
###341 AARON MEZA: Even though you got all those side beers?
###343 PRESTON: Yeah.
###344 Doesn't count.
###345 AARON MEZA: Had you known that, would you
###347 still have done it?
###347 PRESTON: No, I'm just going to keep it below my height all
###349 night so I don't ever become a wizard.
###352 AARON MEZA: Rick, where's your wizard staff?
###354 RICK HOWARD: I'm uh, night off staff.
###358 AARON MEZA: You're going to win the demo then, tomorrow.
###360 RICK HOWARD: I don't think so.
###361 I've got half a leg.
###362 One and a half legs, so.
###364 I'm doing the heel up today.
###367 MIKE CARROLL: Who's not a wizard yet and
###369 wants to be a wizard?
###370 Let's do the shocker game.
###371 Ready?
###373 Set?
###375 Oh.
###377 MALE SPEAKER: (LAUGHING) That's you.
###379 MALE SPEAKER: It was that fast?
###381 MIKE CARROLL: It's not even that fucking strong, though.
###384 That's what sucks.
###385 AARON MEZA: Robbie, put that thing next to you.
###388 ROBBIE RUSSO: Fucking massive.
###391 MALE SPEAKER: I'm Robbie Wizard.
###393 MALE SPEAKER: Use your fucking brain, OK?
###395 You use your brain.
###397 MALE SPEAKER: Wow.
###397 If we shoot off a flash right here--
###398 MALE SPEAKER: You got more of a brain than both
###400 of us, so use it.
###401 MALE SPEAKER: Wow, that really killed like, the rest of the
###405 camp, right?
###405 MALE SPEAKER: You got your photo, man.
###407 That's a pretty good one.
###410 MALE SPEAKER: Turn the light out.
###412 Turn that fucking light out now.
###413 Ugh.
###414 
###419 MALE SPEAKER: I'm so mad.
###420 You didn't drink as much as me.
###422 That's what happens when you're a weak bitch.
###425 And you can't drink as much as me.
###427 
###430 MIKE CARROLL: Sleeper play fight.
###433 MALE SPEAKER: You just lost your whole staff.
###435 You just lost your whole staff.
###438 Your staff sucks.
###440 Your staff sucks!
###441 
###444 All right.
###444 T, would you chill the fuck out?
###448 You're going to get fucking mopped up!
###451 MALE SPEAKER: Shh, shh.
###452 MALE SPEAKER: Chill.
###453 Chill.
###454 Ugh.
###455 I hate when you do the feet thing.
###456 Stop with the feet thing.
###458 Stop with the feet thing.
###460 Stop with the feet thing.
###462 
###465 We're friends!
###466 
###468 Get away!
###469 We're hugging!
###470 
###474 We're hugging.
###476 You better get me near him right now.
###478 MALE SPEAKER: This is aggressive hugging.
###480 MALE SPEAKER: Get me near him.
###482 Why are they holding us back from one another?
###485 We're friends!
###486 MALE SPEAKER: Turn the fucking light off. dude.
###487
