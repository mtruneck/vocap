1
0:0:58,12 --> 0:1:5,659
>>> Jeff Morad is not going to be the executive
officer, he's not severing his relationship


2
0:1:5,659 --> 0:1:13,619
with the team but he's going to continue to
negotiate a lucrative contract with fox sports


3
0:1:13,619 --> 0:1:19,72
a television deal that the Padres have been
working on but he will not be in charge of


4
0:1:19,72 --> 0:1:26,39
the day to day operations, an executive from
inside the office will take that role.


5
0:1:26,39 --> 0:1:31,3
>> DWANE: What does that say about the future
of his role with the Padres?


6
0:1:31,3 --> 0:1:46,179
>> It raises questions.
Morad has been trying to buy 
the team, and he withdrew an application to


7
0:1:46,179 --> 0:1:51,539
complete the sale that was supposed to go
before baseball owners this month.


8
0:1:51,539 --> 0:1:57,789
They weren't sure whether there was uncertainty
over the financial details or he didn't have


9
0:1:57,789 --> 0:2:4,8
the 22 votes of support that he needed.
There are unanswereded questions out there


10
0:2:4,8 --> 0:2:7,229
and Jeff has not been talking publically about
it.


11
0:2:7,229 --> 0:2:19,69
>> DWANE: KPBS Reporter Erik Anderson.
>> AMITA: Staff Sergeant Gary Stein said he


12
0:2:19,69 --> 0:2:24,87
wouldn't follow orders from President Obama,
and changed the post to say he wouldn't follow


13
0:2:24,87 --> 0:2:32,31
illegal orders.
He created a Facebook page called "armed forces


14
0:2:32,31 --> 0:2:38,16
Tea party" earlier this included a "no Obama"
graphic.


15
0:2:38,16 --> 0:2:44,8
The service says' Sergeant can express personal
views about the politics but not as a member


16
0:2:44,8 --> 0:2:52,53
of the armed forces.
On Facebook he says "now that I have been


17
0:2:52,53 --> 0:2:58,73
given a desk job with no computer access I
will have more time to study the Constitution"


18
0:2:58,73 --> 0:3:6,459
he faces a discharge for "other than honorable
conditions" and could be ordered to apay backbone


19
0:3:6,459 --> 0:3:11,569
in yous money and education fees.
>> DWANE: People on shelter island may have


20
0:3:11,569 --> 0:3:19,209
been startled this morning by a Navy drill.
They staged an attack on the USS Princeton


21
0:3:19,209 --> 0:3:38,69
as part of an institutional test.
>> AMITA: If the San Onofri plant stays off,


22
0:3:38,69 --> 0:3:42,739
San Diego could suffer, it supplies 20% of
San Diego's energy and without it officials


23
0:3:42,739 --> 0:3:48,269
say we would face reliability issues when
demand goes up in hot weather.


24
0:3:48,269 --> 0:3:51,909
>> DWANE: A community clean up and repsych
cling eventÊ recycling event will be held


25
0:3:51,909 --> 0:4:2,519
this week.
It's spring cleaning time and if you've been


26
0:4:2,519 --> 0:4:7,73
storing up items such as tires, household
batteries, light bulbs, electronics and furniture


27
0:4:7,73 --> 0:4:15,709
now is the time to get rid of it for free.
City councilman Todd Gloria says this saves


28
0:4:15,709 --> 0:4:22,58
the city money.
>>> The city has to pick up things people


29
0:4:22,58 --> 0:4:27,56
dump so if we can divert those elsewhere,
and take care of things proactively, that's


30
0:4:27,56 --> 0:4:35,65
a big plus for the city.
>> DWANE: It's to keep things like this out


31
0:4:35,65 --> 0:4:40,15
of landfill.
>>> Waste tires are a blight on the community,


32
0:4:40,15 --> 0:4:44,31
they can create mosquito breeding habitats
and other issues.


33
0:4:44,31 --> 0:4:57,2
>> DWANE: The last event was held at qualcom,
Lisa Poston with environmental services says


34
0:4:57,2 --> 0:5:2,4
they will have trucks on hand and recycle
as much as possible.


35
0:5:2,4 --> 0:5:9,97
>>> The trash goes in the landfill but we
try to separate out as much as we can, electronics,


36
0:5:9,97 --> 0:5:17,919
TVs, goes to a recycling center.
>> DWANE: It's from 8 to 1 in the afternoon


37
0:5:17,919 --> 0:5:23,84
Saturday, this is only for San Diego city
residents so no businesses or commercial waste


38
0:5:23,84 --> 0:5:27,71
will be accepted.
A battle is brewing over a proposed power


39
0:5:27,71 --> 0:5:34,28
plant in Santee.
Amita is talk bug that at the round table.


40
0:5:34,28 --> 0:5:41,91
>> AMITA: This evening state officials are
holding a public workshop on a proposed power


41
0:5:41,91 --> 0:5:49,289
plant in San Diego.
Not everyone is in favor of the so called


42
0:5:49,289 --> 0:6:0,99
"Quail brush generation" project.
Robin Kedward joins me, Robin, even though


43
0:6:0,99 --> 0:6:6,159
Santee is in the title of your project, this
is a project located in San Diego.


44
0:6:6,159 --> 0:6:11,81
Why are you opposed to this proposal?
>> First of all, thanks so much for letting


45
0:6:11,81 --> 0:6:15,349
us come here and put the stuff out in the
public.


46
0:6:15,349 --> 0:6:20,599
We're opposed because it doesn't seem like
it's being done right.


47
0:6:20,599 --> 0:6:25,53
You know, the zoning of this plant and the
zoning of the land where this plant has to


48
0:6:25,53 --> 0:6:32,83
go are completely at odds.
When they began to set up San Diego 50 years


49
0:6:32,83 --> 0:6:38,43
ago they set out areas for various things
to be built and San Diego ended up being a


50
0:6:38,43 --> 0:6:45,44
beautiful city of villages connected by freeways.
So the zoning is the fabric of the ground


51
0:6:45,44 --> 0:6:49,62
that makes San Diego.
Now the big request is to change the zoning


52
0:6:49,62 --> 0:6:57,379
in this place from residential which is one
house per every 20 acres down to an industrial


53
0:6:57,379 --> 0:7:2,159
one in order to put that plant in and that
doesn't make sense.


54
0:7:2,159 --> 0:7:4,99
>> AMITA: And what are some of your other
concerns?


55
0:7:4,99 --> 0:7:11,27
>> DWANE: We do have concerns about the pollution
side and the noise side of it.


56
0:7:11,27 --> 0:7:16,53
Santee is a bedroom community, most of the
people that live in Santee work around or


57
0:7:16,53 --> 0:7:21,86
work over in San Diego.
Santee itself is a place where people come


58
0:7:21,86 --> 0:7:23,599
at night.
NowÊ


59
0:7:23,599 --> 0:7:31,409
>> AMITA: So we've got a graphic here.
This shows noise associated with this project.


60
0:7:31,409 --> 0:7:37,379
Explain what we're seeing now.
>>> You're looking at a picture that shows


61
0:7:37,379 --> 0:7:43,83
the amount of noise that will be produced
by this plant measured in a thing called decibels,


62
0:7:43,83 --> 0:7:49,129
and 80 decibellike a motorcycle running outside
of your house 24 hours a day.


63
0:7:49,129 --> 0:7:57,99
If you look at the map, and it says "80 DB"
that's what it would be like.


64
0:7:57,99 --> 0:8:2,759
>> AMITA: Unmitigated?
>> That's what it would be like unmitigated.


65
0:8:2,759 --> 0:8:12,61
These generators make a "deep" sound, similar
in frequency to that used by whales to communicate


66
0:8:12,61 --> 0:8:18,199
and they communicate over hundreds of miles
using low frequencies, so whether the map


67
0:8:18,199 --> 0:8:23,5
shows it or not everybody in mission trails
regional park will be affected by this sound


68
0:8:23,5 --> 0:8:28,389
from the power plant.
>> AMITA: How close is the project to schools


69
0:8:28,389 --> 0:8:31,52
and homes?
>> I measured it on Google earth and it's


70
0:8:31,52 --> 0:8:38,969
660 yards from the power plant down to the
high school, that seems to be close and I


71
0:8:38,969 --> 0:8:44,62
can't find any precedent where that may have
been done before.


72
0:8:44,62 --> 0:8:50,63
It's only 400 yards down to the place where
the children play Little League baseball and


73
0:8:50,63 --> 0:8:56,81
it's only 200 yards down to the edge of mission
trails regional park which is the jewel in


74
0:8:56,81 --> 0:9:3,2
the crown of the park system here in San Diego.
>> AMITA: How has the California energy commission


75
0:9:3,2 --> 0:9:10,22
and cogentrics the company behind this proposal
responded so far?


76
0:9:10,22 --> 0:9:15,6
>> Not very well, they just seemed to be turning
out the same speeches and platitudes that


77
0:9:15,6 --> 0:9:22,9
we have seen from them time and, again.
What we need is assurances that this plant


78
0:9:22,9 --> 0:9:28,6
will be done right.
We're not cowling it what people call a "NIMBE"


79
0:9:28,6 --> 0:9:34,13
we recognize there is a need for the power
plant but let's do it in the proper place


80
0:9:34,13 --> 0:9:38,73
at the proper time with the proper way of
doing things.


81
0:9:38,73 --> 0:9:46,1
>> AMITA: We requested representatives from
co Gentrics come on the show and they could


82
0:9:46,1 --> 0:9:52,1
not but they did appear on our radio show
earlier today, here is what they said.


83
0:9:52,1 --> 0:9:59,47
"The quail brush project is designed for rapid
capability when renewable energy resources


84
0:9:59,47 --> 0:10:5,87
are not available it's primary purpose is
to provide electricity quick and when needed


85
0:10:5,87 --> 0:10:11,68
providing support to the transmission system
and maintaining the overall liability.


86
0:10:11,68 --> 0:10:16,45
It's still in the early stages of the environmental
review process.


87
0:10:16,45 --> 0:10:21,94
We are committed to working with the community
and responding to any issues that may arise."


88
0:10:21,94 --> 0:10:27,55
What about this argument, Robin, that, look,
it's only going to be used during peak demand


89
0:10:27,55 --> 0:10:34,18
and to supplement energy sources.
>>> That seems to be the basis of their argument,


90
0:10:34,18 --> 0:10:40,22
but I can't see at all where a temporary power
station is going to be there for 30 years


91
0:10:40,22 --> 0:10:48,3
is going to be called "temporary" and secondly,
I can't see where the boardroom controlling


92
0:10:48,3 --> 0:10:52,44
the investment that some of these people made
in this thing they're going to spend $180


93
0:10:52,44 --> 0:10:58,74
million to build this, they are going to want
to want a full return on their money, they're


94
0:10:58,74 --> 0:11:6,24
not going to say goodbye to 48 million in
profits.


95
0:11:6,24 --> 0:11:15,7
>> AMITA: At what stage is this process?
>> Right now we're in the talking stage, the


96
0:11:15,7 --> 0:11:18,76
land is still there, green, blowing in the
wind and looking very beautiful.


97
0:11:18,76 --> 0:11:24,48
It needs to remain that way.
>> AMITA: Robin Kedward, thank you.


98
0:11:24,48 --> 0:11:31,329
>>> Thank you.
>> DWANE: We will show you advances in aviation


99
0:11:31,329 --> 0:11:34,41
and how it could affect the future of San
Diego's Lingburgh field.


100
0:11:34,41 --> 0:11:39,74
If you haven't done your taxes, we have advise
from the IRS.


101
0:11:39,74 --> 0:12:15,779
This 


102
0:12:15,779 --> 0:12:34,1
is 


103
0:12:34,1 --> 0:12:54,93
KPBS 


104
0:12:54,93 --> 0:13:16,17
Evening Edition.
>> DWANE: It's tax season and it looks like


105
0:13:16,17 --> 0:13:21,99
you have more breathing room before the deadline,
Amita is getting tax tips from her guest at


106
0:13:21,99 --> 0:13:30,22
the evening edition round table.
>> AMITA: Figuring out your taxes can be "taxing"


107
0:13:30,22 --> 0:13:36,9
but this year the tax deadline is AprilÊ17
so taxpayers have an extra two days to sort


108
0:13:36,9 --> 0:13:40,44
through what they owe or what they are owed
by uncle Sam.


109
0:13:40,44 --> 0:13:48,67
IRS spokesperson, Raphael Tulino joins me.
The economy is still sputtering, what if you


110
0:13:48,67 --> 0:13:53,949
find out you owe the IRS money but you don't
have a lump sum available.


111
0:13:53,949 --> 0:13:58,92
Will the IRS accept a payment plan?
>> Yes as a matter of fact we began a posture


112
0:13:58,92 --> 0:14:5,949
this year, we realizes taxpayers are struggling,
they have a balance due and they can't pay


113
0:14:5,949 --> 0:14:10,37
it.
File the return, okay, then do pay something


114
0:14:10,37 --> 0:14:15,779
and let the IRS know that you can't full pay
what you owe and then we can enter into an


115
0:14:15,779 --> 0:14:24,16
installment agreement plan.
The installment agreement plan is for most


116
0:14:24,16 --> 0:14:30,24
a chance to pay per month, based on what you
have as a tax obligation to make it easier


117
0:14:30,24 --> 0:14:34,209
for you and the agency.
That said, real quick, recently we increased


118
0:14:34,209 --> 0:14:39,18
the threshold for the online plan which you
can qualify for, if it's under $25,000 in


119
0:14:39,18 --> 0:14:44,1
debt, we doubled it to under $50,000, in debt
and that's part of our fresh start program


120
0:14:44,1 --> 0:14:52,639
which we began to help taxpayers in that situation.
>> AMITA: Are there special fees or extra


121
0:14:52,639 --> 0:14:57,6
documentation that you have to provide?
>> There is a fee forÊ depending on the plan,


122
0:14:57,6 --> 0:15:3,819
the stallment agreement you get involved in
but bottom line is do pay something, be proactive


123
0:15:3,819 --> 0:15:7,73
and let us know that you can't full pay, let's
work together.


124
0:15:7,73 --> 0:15:12,36
We want to help and not hinder those folks
that have balances due.


125
0:15:12,36 --> 0:15:18,91
>> AMITA: What about people that are unemployed,
is the IRS cutting them slack?


126
0:15:18,91 --> 0:15:23,18
>> Same thing with the doubling of the installment
agreement was a benefit for those on unemployment,


127
0:15:23,18 --> 0:15:30,569
if you are unemployed there is a chance we
will wave a little bit for six months of your


128
0:15:30,569 --> 0:15:35,35
taxes the penalties which could be less that
you might owe and that was in the fresh start


129
0:15:35,35 --> 0:15:39,9
program.
The bottom line is unemployment is taxable,


130
0:15:39,9 --> 0:15:44,269
generally so you want to keep that in mind.
Folks get unemployment and they don't realize


131
0:15:44,269 --> 0:15:49,279
they have to pay taxes on it but do let us
know.


132
0:15:49,279 --> 0:15:53,209
>> AMITA: You've got the military, San Diego
is home to a lot of military personnel.


133
0:15:53,209 --> 0:15:55,949
Are there any special rules that apply to
them?


134
0:15:55,949 --> 0:16:2,35
And college graduates who are paying off loans.
Any special rules apply to them?


135
0:16:2,35 --> 0:16:10,259
>> Student loan interest is deductible, you
can deduct that on your tax return as a student


136
0:16:10,259 --> 0:16:15,17
and going over to the military there are dozens
and dozens of laws that exist for military


137
0:16:15,17 --> 0:16:27,6
personnel, and the IRS if you key word search
IRS publication three which is the armed forces


138
0:16:27,6 --> 0:16:33,89
tax guide it is full of all the special laws
that exist just for military personnel and


139
0:16:33,89 --> 0:16:37,73
he their families.
>> AMITA: Are there any really good free IRS


140
0:16:37,73 --> 0:16:43,759
online programs helping people do their taxes?
>> You can get free at free file program which


141
0:16:43,759 --> 0:16:49,5
is generally free tax preparation for a federal
income tax return, the key there is $57,000


142
0:16:49,5 --> 0:16:55,839
or less of income, so link into our site,
choose the software provider that we are in


143
0:16:55,839 --> 0:17:6,319
partner with, and file for free, the key is
$57,000 or less, and sites which are up and


144
0:17:6,319 --> 0:17:11,85
running throughout the county through AprilÊ17th,
generally simple returns, $50,000 or less,


145
0:17:11,85 --> 0:17:26,75
and you can find these at 211 or the www.IRS.gov.
>> AMITA: Tax season seems to bring out scam


146
0:17:26,75 --> 0:17:29,8
artists.
Tell us about these.


147
0:17:29,8 --> 0:17:38,44
>>> Okay, the most pervasive and the most
common is phishing.


148
0:17:38,44 --> 0:17:43,67
We don't initiate taxpayers through your email
inbox.


149
0:17:43,67 --> 0:17:53,7
With tax season come scammer and they're look
to go use the IRS as a lure through PHISHing.


150
0:17:53,7 --> 0:18:2,94
We see promoters promoting to you as a senior
citizen who has no filing requirement or little


151
0:18:2,94 --> 0:18:7,909
income to file this return a physical return
for a tax credit that exists but based on


152
0:18:7,909 --> 0:18:15,33
your situation you're going to get it, they're
trying to peddle a bogus refund to you.


153
0:18:15,33 --> 0:18:20,85
If it seems to good to be true, chances are
it probably is.


154
0:18:20,85 --> 0:18:24,96
>> AMITA: Where can people get information
on this?


155
0:18:24,96 --> 0:18:27,91
>> www.IRS.gov.
A wealth of tax information.


156
0:18:27,91 --> 0:18:32,18
>> AMITA: Thanks for speaking to us.
>>> Thank you.


157
0:18:32,18 --> 0:18:40,6
>> San Diego's Lingburgh field will offer
a nonstop flight to Tokyo, possible because


158
0:18:40,6 --> 0:18:55,24
of a new Boeing 747 has the ability to make
it all the way across the ocean.


159
0:18:55,24 --> 0:19:3,58
>>> Boeing calls the 787 the "dreamliner"
and it paid a visit to San Diego last week.


160
0:19:3,58 --> 0:19:11,52
The Boeing spokesperson says it it uses 20
percent less fuel than other airplanes of


161
0:19:11,52 --> 0:19:19,389
equal size due to a bonding technique that
doesn't require rivets through the fuselage.


162
0:19:19,389 --> 0:19:29,32
>>> It saves you in fatigue life, corrosion,
and arrow dynamic efficiency because those


163
0:19:29,32 --> 0:19:32,11
rivets will protrude out of the skin of the
airplane.


164
0:19:32,11 --> 0:19:39,26
>>> The fuel efficiency creates new opportunities
for San Diegans to fly to Asia either nonstop


165
0:19:39,26 --> 0:19:43,21
or with only one connection instead of two.
That's great.


166
0:19:43,21 --> 0:19:48,82
But the need for the dreamliner draws attention
to the limitations of Lind burg and it's short


167
0:19:48,82 --> 0:19:54,51
runway.
>>> The problem with Lingburgh field is not


168
0:19:54,51 --> 0:20:3,47
just the runway, the problem is it sits in
the bottom of a bowl or cup and no matter


169
0:20:3,47 --> 0:20:10,8
if you're taking off east or west you have
the terrain that begins to rise.


170
0:20:10,8 --> 0:20:14,34
>>> And clearing that terrain off a short
runway means you can't carry much fuel because


171
0:20:14,34 --> 0:20:21,52
that weighs down the plane so there is then
a limit to how far you can fly.


172
0:20:21,52 --> 0:20:26,65
The other well known problem with Lingburgh
field is it has only one runway severely limiting


173
0:20:26,65 --> 0:20:29,6
the number of planes that can take off and
land.


174
0:20:29,6 --> 0:20:36,49
Joe Kramer was president of the San Diego
runway authority when it asked residents if


175
0:20:36,49 --> 0:20:46,9
it should move the airport to the Miramar
base.


176
0:20:46,9 --> 0:20:56,33
>>> If the citizens would have approved that,
it would allow the city to begin an expansion


177
0:20:56,33 --> 0:21:3,24
of Miramar that would bring in 10,000 feet
long, four runways to take San Diego into


178
0:21:3,24 --> 0:21:10,279
the next century.
>>> Some of the assumption about the growth


179
0:21:10,279 --> 0:21:18,37
of air travel we made six years ago have changededed.
Not long ago it seemed like air travel was


180
0:21:18,37 --> 0:21:22,51
becoming just another middle class entitlement.
Everybody flu.


181
0:21:22,51 --> 0:21:26,96
If you had a week off you might as well go
visit your brother Bob in Fort Lauderdale.


182
0:21:26,96 --> 0:21:31,71
But about four years ago something happened,
a recession.


183
0:21:31,71 --> 0:21:39,22
Since 2008 the pass zero count at Lingburgh
has dropped by well over a million people.


184
0:21:39,22 --> 0:21:43,85
Seems like a strong contradiction to the claims
made in '06 that Lingburgh would "maximum


185
0:21:43,85 --> 0:21:51,8
out" in 20 years and if the recession weren't
enough more recently something else happened


186
0:21:51,8 --> 0:21:56,409
that you probably noticed at the gas pump,
fuel prices went up dramatically.


187
0:21:56,409 --> 0:22:0,789
Steve van Beak is an airport consultant based
in Washington, D.C.


188
0:22:0,789 --> 0:22:6,6
He says fuel is an airline's greatest expense.
He ads that the prices combined with slow


189
0:22:6,6 --> 0:22:11,98
economy may be bad news for airlines, in a
way it's good news for Lingburgh field.


190
0:22:11,98 --> 0:22:20,909
>>> So planes are fuller and that extends
the life of an airport like Lingburgh probably


191
0:22:20,909 --> 0:22:24,83
10, 15 maybe more years.
>>> Among the pass engineers who useÊ passengers


192
0:22:24,83 --> 0:22:32,74
who use Lingburgh, views are mixed.
>>> I fly to hundreds of airports in the country


193
0:22:32,74 --> 0:22:39,36
and Lingburgh is one of my favorites, small
airport, in and out, easy.


194
0:22:39,36 --> 0:22:43,659
>>> But visit the commuter terminal and you
will hear from passengers who are frustrated


195
0:22:43,659 --> 0:22:49,83
with the lack of direct flights, carston Smithed
is ready to jump on a flight to L.A. but no


196
0:22:49,83 --> 0:23:2,23
direct flight to Germany.
>>> For me it would be a great idea if we


197
0:23:2,23 --> 0:23:8,289
had the ability to promote this a little bit.
I know my colleagues who have business connections


198
0:23:8,289 --> 0:23:11,549
with Germany and Europe would really like
that.


199
0:23:11,549 --> 0:23:18,7
>>> But for now he has to transfer at LAX.
>>> I take the puddle jump everer and my flightÊ


200
0:23:18,7 --> 0:23:28,47
puddle jumper and my flight leaves at 3.
>>> The ability to fly to Frankfurt or Paris


201
0:23:28,47 --> 0:23:35,96
doesn't rely on airplane technology, van Beak
says it depends on the airlines having enough


202
0:23:35,96 --> 0:23:44,29
business, he refers to the Tokyo flight.
>>> The key will be supporting the new 787


203
0:23:44,29 --> 0:23:48,549
flight so business travellers need to fly
nonstop and buy in the premium section of


204
0:23:48,549 --> 0:23:54,9
the cabin and make it profitable.
>>> Today flights like the dreamliner are


205
0:23:54,9 --> 0:24:1,669
improving the international service at Lingburgh.
The runway, well, we're stuck with with it,


206
0:24:1,669 --> 0:24:6,97
even if the marines left Miramar next week
there is no telling that San Diegans would


207
0:24:6,97 --> 0:24:11,69
want that to become a home to a four runway
airport.


208
0:24:11,69 --> 0:24:18,49
>> DWANE: That's KPBS Reporter Tom fudge.
Experts say high speed rail could take the


209
0:24:18,49 --> 0:24:45,85
place of northern California routes.
This is KPBS Evening Edition.


210
0:24:45,85 --> 0:25:47,6
>> AMITA: We will back to the public square
on KPBS Evening Edition.


211
0:25:47,6 --> 0:25:52,64
We have reaction to the case of a camp peddle
ton marine who says he's being discharged


212
0:25:52,64 --> 0:25:59,11
for criticizing President Obama online.
Earlier this month Gary Stein challenged the


213
0:25:59,11 --> 0:26:6,34
president's birth certificate and called the
president a liar.


214
0:26:6,34 --> 0:26:17,289
These came on the Tea party's Facebook page
and Stein says he was relieved of duty.


215
0:26:17,289 --> 0:26:25,69
He says he will fight an ouster.
Manufacture you felt strong that for those


216
0:26:25,69 --> 0:26:30,84
who believe the Sergeant should blindly follow
orders would have made good natzi's "I was


217
0:26:30,84 --> 0:26:35,9
only following orders" defense.
Obama would not know the Constitution if it


218
0:26:35,9 --> 0:26:41,23
ran over him.
I believe our job is to President Clinton


219
0:26:41,23 --> 0:26:45,779
the Constitution Obama is trying to destroy
both.


220
0:26:45,779 --> 0:26:51,94
President Obama was a constitutional law professor.
Michael had this to say.


221
0:26:51,94 --> 0:26:57,59
The marine Sergeant I'm sure repeated the
same oath that I had when I enlisted.


222
0:26:57,59 --> 0:27:3,929
That solemn oath states that one will defend
the U.S. from enemies foreign and domestic.


223
0:27:3,929 --> 0:27:11,299
One will reflect honor on himself and to one's
country and always respect and follow the


224
0:27:11,299 --> 0:27:16,7
orders of your superiors from the commander
in chief on dawn.


225
0:27:16,7 --> 0:27:20,899
He gave up his right to bad mouth the president
as soon as he signed his enlistment papers


226
0:27:20,899 --> 0:27:26,74
and raised his right hand.

0:27:38,279 --> 0:27:44,96
down, Jeff Morad will remain and develop fox
sports San Diego.


230
0:27:44,96 --> 0:27:50,429
And state power officials say they have plans
if the San Onofri power plant is not back


231
0:27:50,429 --> 0:27:57,59
on line by summer.
