2
0:0:12,87 --> 0:0:14,73
-What do you think, Dave?


3
0:0:14,73 --> 0:0:18,8
DAVE HATCHETT: I think it's
time to go off, off the


4
0:0:18,8 --> 0:0:20,52
Richter scale, that is.


5
0:0:20,52 --> 0:0:23,99
If you flash a line 15, 20 years
ago, and it's a big,


6
0:0:23,99 --> 0:0:26,21
gnarly line in Alaska or
wherever, and you flash it


7
0:0:26,21 --> 0:0:28,57
clean, what's the difference
between then and


8
0:0:28,57 --> 0:0:29,93
20 years from now?


9
0:0:29,93 --> 0:0:32,64
You could put it in a segment
today, and a lot of the riders


10
0:0:32,64 --> 0:0:34,55
would love to have that
in their part if they


11
0:0:34,55 --> 0:0:36,44
rode it that well.


12
0:0:36,44 --> 0:0:38,68
MIKE HATCHETT: I can go back
to "TB5" and watch a movie.


13
0:0:38,68 --> 0:0:40,54
And I'm not trying to sound
arrogant or whatever on the


14
0:0:40,54 --> 0:0:42,38
filmmaking point of it,
but I can put in


15
0:0:42,38 --> 0:0:44,97
"TB5" Alaska footage.


16
0:0:44,97 --> 0:0:47,98
And I can put in Alaska footage
from this year, and I


17
0:0:47,98 --> 0:0:50,42
can be like, I don't
see a difference.


18
0:0:50,42 --> 0:0:52,78
In fact, I think the stuff from
'95 is almost better.


19
0:0:52,78 --> 0:1:8,85
[MUSIC PLAYING]


20
0:1:8,85 --> 0:1:10,185
DAVE DOWNING: Yeah,
"TB5," Johan part


21
0:1:10,185 --> 0:1:12,0
was the one for sure.


22
0:1:12,0 --> 0:1:12,79
It still is.


23
0:1:12,79 --> 0:1:16,61
You look back at that part, and
if he filmed that right


24
0:1:16,61 --> 0:1:18,45
now, it'd still be a
groundbreaking part


25
0:1:18,45 --> 0:1:19,63
right now, I think.


26
0:1:19,63 --> 0:1:23,19
And that's pretty cool to
witness that firsthand, see it


27
0:1:23,19 --> 0:1:24,5
with my own eyes.


28
0:1:24,5 --> 0:1:29,7
JEREMY JONES: He's like
a wild animal.


29
0:1:29,7 --> 0:1:32,97
He'd get to the top and just
be like, cameramen, media,


30
0:1:32,97 --> 0:1:33,985
this is Johan.


31
0:1:33,985 --> 0:1:36,89
I'm dropping in 10 seconds.


32
0:1:36,89 --> 0:1:39,65
And cameramen are
just scrambling.


33
0:1:39,65 --> 0:1:40,79
No back and forth.


34
0:1:40,79 --> 0:1:42,65
That would be the only
communication


35
0:1:42,65 --> 0:1:43,35
you'd hear from Johan.


36
0:1:43,35 --> 0:1:46,92
And then he'd go do something
that no one's ever done before


37
0:1:46,92 --> 0:1:47,68
on a snowboard.


38
0:1:47,68 --> 0:1:51,3
And half of his best riding
probably wasn't on film,


39
0:1:51,3 --> 0:1:53,85
because he didn't feel like
waiting for cameramen.


40
0:1:53,85 --> 0:2:10,782
[MUSIC PLAYING]


41
0:2:10,782 --> 0:2:13,65
EIKI HELGASON: Yeah, this was
the first Standard movies from


42
0:2:13,65 --> 0:2:15,61
one to six just a
few weeks ago.


43
0:2:15,61 --> 0:2:18,65
And man, the riders there were
just standing it for the


44
0:2:18,65 --> 0:2:22,6
sketchiest jumps and bigger then
than they're doing today.


45
0:2:22,6 --> 0:2:23,26
It's so sick.


46
0:2:23,26 --> 0:2:24,85
I got so pumped just
seeing back flips


47
0:2:24,85 --> 0:2:26,31
off the biggest cliffs.


48
0:2:26,31 --> 0:2:28,28
And front flips.


49
0:2:28,28 --> 0:2:29,365
They're standing it.


50
0:2:29,365 --> 0:2:30,6
I like that.


51
0:2:30,6 --> 0:2:36,72
JEREMY JONES: Noah's descent
in "TB5" on Super Spines is


52
0:2:36,72 --> 0:2:39,11
hands down--


53
0:2:39,11 --> 0:2:41,746
changed what that dream run
was in big mountain


54
0:2:41,746 --> 0:2:43,37
riding in one line.


55
0:2:43,37 --> 0:3:0,43
[MUSIC PLAYING]


56
0:3:0,43 --> 0:3:2,7
DAVE HATCHETT: Definitely my
most famous first descent is


57
0:3:2,7 --> 0:3:3,78
the Mendenhall Towers.


58
0:3:3,78 --> 0:3:5,12
And that was in Juno.


59
0:3:5,12 --> 0:3:8,79
We had a heli, and we were like,
we want to go there, we


60
0:3:8,79 --> 0:3:9,63
want to go there.


61
0:3:9,63 --> 0:3:11,33
And we just started pointing
at the mountains, which are


62
0:3:11,33 --> 0:3:13,99
all basically now the runs that
are right off the road.


63
0:3:13,99 --> 0:3:15,285
But at that point,
they were all--


64
0:3:15,285 --> 0:3:17,23
a good portion of them
were first descents.


65
0:3:17,23 --> 0:3:27,24
[MUSIC PLAYING]


66
0:3:27,24 --> 0:3:29,885
JEREMY JONES: I would say both
of those descents, the Super


67
0:3:29,885 --> 0:3:33,5
Spines descent and the
Mendenhall Towers descent--


68
0:3:33,5 --> 0:3:36,49
before those guys did that, no
one thought that you could


69
0:3:36,49 --> 0:3:38,84
ever ski or snowboard down
something like that.


70
0:3:38,84 --> 0:3:42,66
It just shattered the ceiling
and was like, we were all


71
0:3:42,66 --> 0:3:46,76
looking over this way, they go
and do this, and we're like,


72
0:3:46,76 --> 0:3:48,94
OK, that's what we should
be looking at.


73
0:3:48,94 --> 0:3:50,93
JIM RIPPEY: And as I would talk
to people who would watch


74
0:3:50,93 --> 0:3:52,59
the videos--


75
0:3:52,59 --> 0:3:56,26
it's usually those one or two
shots where you almost kill


76
0:3:56,26 --> 0:4:1,7
yourself and you're just
totally, totally going for it


77
0:4:1,7 --> 0:4:1,8
that they remember.


78
0:4:1,8 --> 0:4:3,88
LONNIE KAUK: Yeah, "TB4"
was the one.


79
0:4:3,88 --> 0:4:5,84
Like, you see Rippey
doing that big old


80
0:4:5,84 --> 0:4:7,31
back flip off of there.


81
0:4:7,31 --> 0:4:9,66
And it was just like
next level.


82
0:4:9,66 --> 0:4:11,62
You're like, I want
to be that dude


83
0:4:11,62 --> 0:4:12,9
snowboarding in the video.


84
0:4:12,9 --> 0:4:14,49
JIM RIPPEY: We got out
of the helicopter.


85
0:4:14,49 --> 0:4:18,97
Terje saw something he wanted to
do, some turns down below.


86
0:4:18,97 --> 0:4:21,149
And I didn't really
see anything.


87
0:4:21,149 --> 0:4:23,38
So I kind of walked over to
the ridge, and I saw this


88
0:4:23,38 --> 0:4:24,37
perfect cliff.


89
0:4:24,37 --> 0:4:27,99
I've always loved jumping off
cliffs, because what you get


90
0:4:27,99 --> 0:4:30,59
when you jump off a cliff is,
you get that acceleration


91
0:4:30,59 --> 0:4:34,9
experience where you're going
from going really slow and


92
0:4:34,9 --> 0:4:35,91
just feel that drop rate.


93
0:4:35,91 --> 0:4:41,724
[MUSIC PLAYING]


94
0:4:41,724 --> 0:4:43,75
TERJE HAAKONSEN: If I remember,
we did a run right


95
0:4:43,75 --> 0:4:46,65
next to it, like first time I
went on a big mountain that


96
0:4:46,65 --> 0:4:49,685
was that long and that
steep for that long.


97
0:4:49,685 --> 0:4:52,33
And what I remember is just
doing airs on the way down on


98
0:4:52,33 --> 0:4:53,42
small, little bumps.


99
0:4:53,42 --> 0:4:55,77
And you would just fly for so
long, because it was so steep.


100
0:4:55,77 --> 0:5:5,23
[MUSIC PLAYING]


101
0:5:5,23 --> 0:5:8,39
JIM RIPPEY: I remember him being
like, this is sketchy,


102
0:5:8,39 --> 0:5:9,11
this is sketchy.


103
0:5:9,11 --> 0:5:9,975
Like, of course it's sketchy.


104
0:5:9,975 --> 0:5:13,39
We're flying around in a
helicopter looking over these


105
0:5:13,39 --> 0:5:14,265
crazy peaks.


106
0:5:14,265 --> 0:5:17,28
TERJE HAAKONSEN: The whole
intensity level when you go


107
0:5:17,28 --> 0:5:21,5
first is obviously a little
higher because what's going to


108
0:5:21,5 --> 0:5:22,8
happen and stuff.


109
0:5:22,8 --> 0:5:25,33
We tore airs up there,
too, and Jim.


110
0:5:25,33 --> 0:5:28,5
I'm like, yeah, sure,
you could go first.


111
0:5:28,5 --> 0:5:31,7
And then Mike on the radio,
Terje, you're going first, and


112
0:5:31,7 --> 0:5:34,88
you're going now.


113
0:5:34,88 --> 0:5:35,53
I'm like, OK.


114
0:5:35,53 --> 0:5:48,66
[MUSIC PLAYING]


115
0:5:48,66 --> 0:5:49,56
DAVE HATCHETT: This
looks so easy.


116
0:5:49,56 --> 0:5:50,51
You're like, I could do that.


117
0:5:50,51 --> 0:5:54,8
But you don't really realize,
or maybe you do, what could


118
0:5:54,8 --> 0:5:55,65
happen if something
went wrong.


119
0:5:55,65 --> 0:5:57,96
And that's when you watch the
bail segments, and you watch


120
0:5:57,96 --> 0:6:1,37
Tom tumble through rocks, or
some of Jeremy's close calls.


121
0:6:1,37 --> 0:6:5,12
And you really, really realize
what could happen if you hook


122
0:6:5,12 --> 0:6:6,88
an edge in the chute
or a rock line.


123
0:6:6,88 --> 0:6:10,13
And all it takes is one tumble
onto a rock, and you're toast.


124
0:6:10,13 --> 0:6:17,32
[MUSIC PLAYING]


125
0:6:17,32 --> 0:6:20,13
LONNIE KAUK: They'll show a
video, and people will just be


126
0:6:20,13 --> 0:6:22,79
like, oh, dude, I would've done
that, or I would've went


127
0:6:22,79 --> 0:6:24,16
there, I would've done that.


128
0:6:24,16 --> 0:6:26,3
You're like, dude, you got no
idea what it looks like when


129
0:6:26,3 --> 0:6:26,95
you're riding down that.


130
0:6:26,95 --> 0:6:29,5
Like, dude, you're either scared
as shit, or you just


131
0:6:29,5 --> 0:6:30,44
forget where you're at.


132
0:6:30,44 --> 0:6:31,72
And it freaks you out.


133
0:6:31,72 --> 0:6:32,59
And then everybody's
like, oh, dude,


134
0:6:32,59 --> 0:6:34,9
you're just riding along.


135
0:6:34,9 --> 0:6:35,25
It doesn't mean anything.


136
0:6:35,25 --> 0:6:38,495
It's like, dude, you have no
idea what it takes to freaking


137
0:6:38,495 --> 0:6:39,97
do that stuff.


138
0:6:39,97 --> 0:6:40,53
It's gnarly.


139
0:6:40,53 --> 0:6:49,76
[MUSIC PLAYING]


140
0:6:49,76 --> 0:6:53,24
JEREMY JONES: The thing with
riding these serious lines is


141
0:6:53,24 --> 0:6:55,1
crew is everything.


142
0:6:55,1 --> 0:6:59,5
And Mike and Dave are some of
the best, most experienced


143
0:6:59,5 --> 0:7:0,7
guys in the mountains
in the world.


144
0:7:0,7 --> 0:7:5,47
So when I'm on a line and need
to get advice, I can call up


145
0:7:5,47 --> 0:7:9,13
the cameramen and they're giving
me world-class, on


146
0:7:9,13 --> 0:7:11,415
point feedback.


147
0:7:11,415 --> 0:7:14,62
MIKE HATCHETT: Even me, I'll
let my guard down, just not


148
0:7:14,62 --> 0:7:17,72
thinking, hey, is that guy in
the right spot to respond to a


149
0:7:17,72 --> 0:7:19,78
rescue or whatever?


150
0:7:19,78 --> 0:7:23,4
You see people, and there's just
three dudes on the slope


151
0:7:23,4 --> 0:7:24,93
at the same time, and that
guy's in the way of the


152
0:7:24,93 --> 0:7:26,41
[? abbey, ?] and there's some
guy standing on the cornice,


153
0:7:26,41 --> 0:7:29,97
and that guy's snowmobiling
here, and just no one--


154
0:7:29,97 --> 0:7:33,14
they're just like, dude, what
if something happens?


155
0:7:33,14 --> 0:7:34,16
Is anyone ready?


156
0:7:34,16 --> 0:7:35,4
Is anyone even paying
attention here?


157
0:7:35,4 --> 0:7:38,26
JIM RIPPEY: They take the
back country seriously.


158
0:7:38,26 --> 0:7:40,8
They assess the snow
conditions.


159
0:7:40,8 --> 0:7:43,73
And Mike is always taking that
very serious, way more serious


160
0:7:43,73 --> 0:7:44,31
than I did.


161
0:7:44,31 --> 0:7:47,3
There was a lot of times where
Mike and I would almost butt


162
0:7:47,3 --> 0:7:48,99
heads, because I'm like,
let me do this.


163
0:7:48,99 --> 0:7:50,74
And he'd be like, no,
it's not safe.


164
0:7:50,74 --> 0:7:54,85
JEREMY JONES: watch a kid be
lining up a gap or something.


165
0:7:54,85 --> 0:7:58,3
And I've seen them time and
again be like, you know what,


166
0:7:58,3 --> 0:8:0,63
I haven't seen enough out of you
that tells me that you're


167
0:8:0,63 --> 0:8:1,64
going to make that gap.


168
0:8:1,64 --> 0:8:5,3
You came up short on this jump,
you overshot this jump,


169
0:8:5,3 --> 0:8:6,8
and there's a five
foot sweet spot.


170
0:8:6,8 --> 0:8:8,85
And if you don't get it, you're
going to hurt yourself.


171
0:8:8,85 --> 0:8:9,785
I'm not shooting it.


172
0:8:9,785 --> 0:8:12,35
DAVE HATCHETT: I've definitely
seen and witnessed a lot of


173
0:8:12,35 --> 0:8:14,77
really close calls with me
filming other riders with


174
0:8:14,77 --> 0:8:18,18
trees that have been way
too close for comfort.


175
0:8:18,18 --> 0:8:22,28
TOM BURT: We were trying this
follow-cam shot through this


176
0:8:22,28 --> 0:8:23,97
little slot rock.


177
0:8:23,97 --> 0:8:28,7
But it had a little wave in it,
it's a wind wave, but it


178
0:8:28,7 --> 0:8:29,75
was almost like a kicker.


179
0:8:29,75 --> 0:8:31,75
DAVE HATCHETT: We saw a little
wind drift at the bottom, and


180
0:8:31,75 --> 0:8:33,39
we threw snowballs at it.


181
0:8:33,39 --> 0:8:34,47
And it seemed soft.


182
0:8:34,47 --> 0:8:37,88
The snowballs disappeared,
and we all agreed it


183
0:8:37,88 --> 0:8:39,24
looked like it was OK.


184
0:8:39,24 --> 0:8:41,429
There was a tree kind of in the
fall line to the right.


185
0:8:41,429 --> 0:8:43,96
But we all thought, oh, we'll
just hit that little snow


186
0:8:43,96 --> 0:8:45,39
drift, and we'll just
ride right over it.


187
0:8:45,39 --> 0:8:46,99
TOM BURT: And so
I went through.


188
0:8:46,99 --> 0:8:48,91
And I don't want to
hit that lip.


189
0:8:48,91 --> 0:8:51,64
I got bucked, but when
he hit it, he was


190
0:8:51,64 --> 0:8:53,14
trying to save the camera.


191
0:8:53,14 --> 0:8:55,45
And he got whipped around
and lost his edge.


192
0:8:55,45 --> 0:8:57,51
And then he slid down the
hill and slammed this


193
0:8:57,51 --> 0:8:58,695
tree that was there.


194
0:8:58,695 --> 0:9:1,42
DAVE HATCHETT: He must have
missed the tree by two to six


195
0:9:1,42 --> 0:9:2,73
inches, maybe.


196
0:9:2,73 --> 0:9:6,94
I just grazed the tree with the
tail of my snowboard, kind


197
0:9:6,94 --> 0:9:9,68
of sliding butt-first
down the hill.


198
0:9:9,68 --> 0:9:11,65
Luckily, that's how I
hit it, tail first.


199
0:9:11,65 --> 0:9:14,16
And it was actually enough
force to break my femur.


200
0:9:14,16 --> 0:9:15,79
And it broke my femur
and my hip.


201
0:9:15,79 --> 0:9:17,78
So of course, I was completely
out that year.


202
0:9:17,78 --> 0:9:20,58
And it was definitely a
pretty big blow to me.


203
0:9:20,58 --> 0:9:23,3
Physically, it was an insane
injury to come back from.


204
0:9:23,3 --> 0:9:27,52
And after that, I wanted to come
back, and I wanted to do


205
0:9:27,52 --> 0:9:29,21
everything I was doing before.


206
0:9:29,21 --> 0:9:31,9
But by the time I came back
from the injury, it was


207
0:9:31,9 --> 0:9:35,65
another year and then another
year after that to even be


208
0:9:35,65 --> 0:9:37,15
100% again.


209
0:9:37,15 --> 0:9:39,68
And at that point, I was a
couple years older, and I just


210
0:9:39,68 --> 0:9:40,71
kind of realized some things.


211
0:9:40,71 --> 0:9:43,78
And I kind of lost the
desire after that.


212
0:9:43,78 --> 0:9:46,37
I would say that, in a sense,
breaking my femur put an end


213
0:9:46,37 --> 0:9:47,71
to my snowboard career.


214
0:9:47,71 --> 0:9:51,51
So definitely, trees don't
move when you hit them.


215
0:9:51,51 --> 0:11:51,51
