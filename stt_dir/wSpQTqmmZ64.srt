1
0:0:5,287 --> 0:0:8,647
<i>Oh my God I can't</i>
<i>believe I'm about to do this,</i>


2
0:0:8,647 --> 0:0:10,887
What's wrong?


3
0:0:10,887 --> 0:0:13,487
- l lost my mop.
- Really?


4
0:0:13,487 --> 0:0:17,207
No. But that's the only thing
that could make me unhappy, right?


5
0:0:17,207 --> 0:0:20,47
You people think of me
as nothing but The Janitor.


6
0:0:20,47 --> 0:0:24,687
- That's not true.
- What's my name?


7
0:0:24,687 --> 0:0:28,7
l know that the nurses
call you Sir Plunge-a-lot.


8
0:0:28,7 --> 0:0:30,87
- l know.
- Come on.


9
0:0:30,87 --> 0:0:34,87
- l'm sure you don't know my name so...
- John Michael Dorian.


10
0:0:34,87 --> 0:0:38,247
- How did you know my middle name?
- Because l care.


11
0:0:38,247 --> 0:0:42,7
<i>Today seems like a good day to</i>
<i>hide out in one of my patient's rooms,</i>


12
0:0:42,7 --> 0:0:44,327
You, my friend,
are an incompetent fool!


13
0:0:44,327 --> 0:0:46,727
<i>Unless of course</i>
<i>my patient is missing,</i>


14
0:0:46,727 --> 0:0:48,487
Where's my brother?


15
0:0:48,487 --> 0:0:53,767
Say, ''l don't know,'' l'll show you what
l learned in my crotch-punching class.


16
0:0:53,767 --> 0:0:57,647
l think it's great that
you're going back to school.


17
0:0:57,647 --> 0:1:1,647
Why would he wander off?
Oh, maybe he went to a real hospital.


18
0:1:1,647 --> 0:1:3,807
He found out
he had leukaemia yesterday.


19
0:1:3,807 --> 0:1:8,247
That's life-changing news. You
can't be surprised if he's depressed.


20
0:1:8,247 --> 0:1:9,607
Hey, doc!


21
0:1:9,607 --> 0:1:12,527
This guy's got something
on his shoulder. Take a look.


22
0:1:12,527 --> 0:1:15,367
Ben, put the small children down.


23
0:1:15,367 --> 0:1:17,127
ls anybody missing one of these?


24
0:1:17,127 --> 0:1:19,127
OK!


25
0:1:19,127 --> 0:1:21,487
You heard the doctor.
Sit this one out.


26
0:1:21,487 --> 0:1:23,447
- Please...
- My hands are free to...


27
0:1:23,447 --> 0:1:26,287
No, no, Ben! Seriously, Ben!
Ben! No, come on, Ben!


28
0:1:26,287 --> 0:1:29,247
Stop, Ben. Put me down. Ben!


29
0:1:29,247 --> 0:1:34,967
Faster!


30
0:1:34,967 --> 0:1:37,447
Eagle!


31
0:1:37,447 --> 0:1:43,247
You had enough?


32
0:1:43,247 --> 0:1:45,487
- Sad.
- You want a turn?


33
0:1:45,487 --> 0:1:49,487
- Come on.
- Don't you dare! Don't you dare! No!


34
0:1:49,487 --> 0:1:53,47
- No! Ben, put me down! No!
- Get a shot of the mean lady.


35
0:1:53,47 --> 0:1:55,727
Hey, shorty.
You short person,


36
0:1:55,727 --> 0:2:13,927
you take that picture, you'll be glad
you're in a hospital. Help!


37
0:2:13,927 --> 0:2:16,447
You've got
a Christmas card right there.


38
0:2:16,447 --> 0:2:20,127
You're funny. l don't understand why
you refuse to put on a gown.


39
0:2:20,127 --> 0:2:22,767
Because l don't
like people to see my bum.


40
0:2:22,767 --> 0:2:25,567
- So wear underwear.
- You know how l feel about underwear.


41
0:2:25,567 --> 0:2:28,7
Every girl who came to our
house in the mid-'80s


42
0:2:28,7 --> 0:2:30,647
- knows how you feel.
- Sweatpants years.


43
0:2:30,647 --> 0:2:34,607
l don't like that much freedom down
there. Makes me tingle in my giblets.


44
0:2:34,607 --> 0:2:37,7
lf you don't
start taking this seriously...


45
0:2:37,7 --> 0:2:40,927
<i>I'm a good intern but when</i>
<i>you're dealing with disease and family</i>


46
0:2:40,927 --> 0:2:44,847
<i>an intern just doesn't cut it,</i>
<i>What you need,,,</i>


47
0:2:44,847 --> 0:2:45,927
<i>,,,is a hero,</i>


48
0:2:45,927 --> 0:2:48,927
Shut up. Shut up.
And definitely shut up.


49
0:2:48,927 --> 0:2:50,367
But, l didn't say any...


50
0:2:50,367 --> 0:2:53,687
l know, but l enjoy saying it to you.
OK, here's the deal.


51
0:2:53,687 --> 0:2:56,607
lf we're gonna beat this thing,
and we damn sure are,


52
0:2:56,607 --> 0:2:58,527
we'll do it one way
and one way only:


53
0:2:58,527 --> 0:3:2,367
- We're gonna be a team, team, team.
- l hear you, Dr Cox.


54
0:3:2,367 --> 0:3:5,327
l am so not speaking to you,
Rhonda, thank you.


55
0:3:5,327 --> 0:3:7,287
l'm sorry, l'm very excited. Go!


56
0:3:7,287 --> 0:3:9,887
What do you say, children?
Are we a team?


57
0:3:9,887 --> 0:3:12,327
l'm in.


58
0:3:12,327 --> 0:3:14,367
Go Team Cancer.


59
0:3:14,367 --> 0:3:16,247
<i>Wow he did it,</i>


60
0:3:16,247 --> 0:3:22,567
l've got to go take care
of some other patients.


61
0:3:22,567 --> 0:3:26,7
l don't believe it. l didn't
get tomorrow's Whipple procedure.


62
0:3:26,7 --> 0:3:27,847
- l know.
- This is ridiculous.


63
0:3:27,847 --> 0:3:28,927
Calm down.


64
0:3:28,927 --> 0:3:33,687
What's a brother got to do to get a
Whipple? What's a brother got to do?


65
0:3:33,687 --> 0:3:36,927
Listen. You've got to stop
turning your medical training


66
0:3:36,927 --> 0:3:41,47
into some ego-driven contest.
No one else is doing that.


67
0:3:41,47 --> 0:3:43,487
Oh, l got the Whipple.


68
0:3:43,487 --> 0:3:45,407
Suck it, Turk.


69
0:3:45,407 --> 0:3:47,927
- l will end her.
- No, no.


70
0:3:47,927 --> 0:3:49,727
- Dude, let her go.
- Let go of me.


71
0:3:49,727 --> 0:3:52,127
lt'll be so hot.


72
0:3:52,127 --> 0:3:57,727
Can you tell me the treatment regimen
for organophosphate toxicity, Dr Reid?


73
0:3:57,727 --> 0:3:59,887
l would give
intramuscular epinephrine,


74
0:3:59,887 --> 0:4:3,127
then lV calcium gluconate,
and emergency haemodialysis.


75
0:4:3,127 --> 0:4:6,567
lf l wanted you
to give me three wrong answers in a row


76
0:4:6,567 --> 0:4:9,887
l would have just asked
for ''the usual.''


77
0:4:9,887 --> 0:4:11,767
Dr Murphy, care to jump in?


78
0:4:11,767 --> 0:4:14,207
l think it's...


79
0:4:14,207 --> 0:4:16,847
- Do you have a speech impediment?
- Excuse me?


80
0:4:16,847 --> 0:4:19,847
You insist on starting
every answer with ''um.''


81
0:4:19,847 --> 0:4:22,247
So you've either got a speech impediment


82
0:4:22,247 --> 0:4:26,807
or you're a stammering know-nothing
who doesn't belong in medicine.


83
0:4:26,807 --> 0:4:28,487
Well spoken.


84
0:4:28,487 --> 0:4:30,767
Now, get out!
All of you! Get out!


85
0:4:30,767 --> 0:4:34,47
Get out! Out! Out! Out!


86
0:4:34,47 --> 0:4:37,127
Jumpin' Jupiter,
l do enjoy the tough love.


87
0:4:37,127 --> 0:4:40,287
They probably like it too,
whether they admit it or not.


88
0:4:40,287 --> 0:4:42,247
Well...


89
0:4:42,247 --> 0:4:47,167
''Oh, the old guy's so tough on me,
but l love him.'' Right?


90
0:4:47,167 --> 0:4:50,7
Right? They hate you, Bob.


91
0:4:50,7 --> 0:4:53,367
They hate you from your hooves
to the top of your pitchfork.


92
0:4:53,367 --> 0:4:57,807
They hate you,
dear God, they hate you good.


93
0:4:57,807 --> 0:4:59,327
What're you laughing at?


94
0:4:59,327 --> 0:5:3,247
That ''hooves'' and ''pitchfork'' part.


95
0:5:3,247 --> 0:5:7,927
- Why?
- No reason.


96
0:5:7,927 --> 0:5:12,287
Now, do you think you can make
Ben behave like a patient or not?


97
0:5:12,287 --> 0:5:15,407
No problem.


98
0:5:15,407 --> 0:5:18,647
- l got him to put his gown on.
- He sure did.


99
0:5:18,647 --> 0:5:21,847
And now my butt itches on
account of this scratchy chair.


100
0:5:21,847 --> 0:5:23,207
What're we watching?


101
0:5:23,207 --> 0:5:27,567
<i>Wings,</i> And shut up,
l like the cab driver. He slays me.


102
0:5:27,567 --> 0:5:30,167
Antonio. Played by
the actor Tony Shalhoub,


103
0:5:30,167 --> 0:5:33,207
also particularly fantastic
in a film called <i>Big Night,</i>


104
0:5:33,207 --> 0:5:36,767
Congratulations. Your DiMaggio-like
streak for saying nothing


105
0:5:36,767 --> 0:5:41,287
even remotely interesting
is still alive and well.


106
0:5:41,287 --> 0:5:43,407
<i>I didn't care about the abuse,</i>


107
0:5:43,407 --> 0:5:47,207
<i>The most amazing thing was to</i>
<i>watch how Dr Cox dealt with his friend,</i>


108
0:5:47,207 --> 0:5:49,207
<i>How he made him feel safe,</i>


109
0:5:49,207 --> 0:5:52,567
- Do l have to get a special doctor?
- An oncologist.


110
0:5:52,567 --> 0:5:55,927
Do we have to talk about this? You
must have something else on your mind.


111
0:5:55,927 --> 0:6:0,327
Nope. Just pretty much
that leukaemia thing.


112
0:6:0,327 --> 0:6:4,487
Ben, leukaemia is a petty, ugly illness


113
0:6:4,487 --> 0:6:6,887
and we'll not dignify it
by speaking of it


114
0:6:6,887 --> 0:6:10,47
unless absolutely necessary.
ls that clear to you?


115
0:6:10,47 --> 0:6:14,407
Gotcha.


116
0:6:14,407 --> 0:6:17,127
You are such a stud.


117
0:6:17,127 --> 0:6:20,127
That was interesting.


118
0:6:20,127 --> 0:6:22,127
So, Doctor Wen.


119
0:6:22,127 --> 0:6:25,407
You asked Bonnie to assist you
with this Whipple procedure?


120
0:6:25,407 --> 0:6:33,487
- Yes, l did.
- Thanks again, sir.


121
0:6:33,487 --> 0:6:35,607
l guess we should just let it go.


122
0:6:35,607 --> 0:6:42,567
l mean, neither one of us wants to
do anything to make it worse, right?


123
0:6:42,567 --> 0:6:47,847
You guys ever notice
how you're both Asian?


124
0:6:47,847 --> 0:6:50,727
Your mother's maiden name is Turner.


125
0:6:50,727 --> 0:6:55,687
So you used your key to get
into my personnel file. Big deal.


126
0:6:55,687 --> 0:6:58,567
Your first kiss was with Sarah Briggs


127
0:6:58,567 --> 0:7:1,327
at the embarrassing age of 1 6.


128
0:7:1,327 --> 0:7:2,967
She wore a green turtleneck.


129
0:7:2,967 --> 0:7:7,447
You wonder sometimes if she still
thinks about you. l'm guessing no.


130
0:7:7,447 --> 0:7:20,567
- How could you possibly know that?
- l'm your father.


131
0:7:20,567 --> 0:7:22,7
Good morning, Dr Dorian.


132
0:7:22,7 --> 0:7:26,727
You probably don't notice it yourself,
but this hospital is a freak show.


133
0:7:26,727 --> 0:7:28,247
This is my band.


134
0:7:28,247 --> 0:7:32,287
We're all working from different
departments in the hospital.


135
0:7:32,287 --> 0:7:34,247
- <i>Legal</i>
- <i>Accounting</i>


136
0:7:34,247 --> 0:7:36,967
- <i>Shipping and Receiving</i>
- <i>Online Property Management</i>


137
0:7:36,967 --> 0:7:39,327
<i>Including Pest Control</i>
<i>Night Time Security</i>


138
0:7:39,327 --> 0:7:43,927
<i>And Non-Arboreal</i>
<i>Gardening Services</i>


139
0:7:43,927 --> 0:7:45,647
That's... That's just great.


140
0:7:45,647 --> 0:8:7,127
We mostly do a cappella versions
of cartoon theme songs.


141
0:8:7,127 --> 0:8:10,87
Dr Reid, l hope
l wasn't too harsh on you


142
0:8:10,87 --> 0:8:12,687
- at rounds this morning.
- Oh, it's OK, sir.


143
0:8:12,687 --> 0:8:14,967
l don't hate myself much
more than usual.


144
0:8:14,967 --> 0:8:19,807
Well, turnabout's fair play, and all
that, so here's an evaluation form.


145
0:8:19,807 --> 0:8:23,327
l figured l'd try to get a read
on how all you interns think l'm doing.


146
0:8:23,327 --> 0:8:25,287
Don't sign your name.


147
0:8:25,287 --> 0:8:28,887
lt's completely anonymous,
and Dr Reid, l'm no she-doc.


148
0:8:28,887 --> 0:8:33,927
l can take it.


149
0:8:33,927 --> 0:8:36,607
- You're going to crush him, right?
- Oh, yes.


150
0:8:36,607 --> 0:8:39,127
- How do you spell ''inadequate''?
- Give me that.


151
0:8:39,127 --> 0:8:41,247
l'll fill it out for you.


152
0:8:41,247 --> 0:8:44,167
So, Mr Sullivan,
your blast percentage


153
0:8:44,167 --> 0:8:47,367
is quite a bit higher than we
all expected. Around 80 percent.


154
0:8:47,367 --> 0:8:51,727
That's bad, right? You want the number
to be low, huh? Like in golf?


155
0:8:51,727 --> 0:8:55,567
Yes, exactly.
Like in golf. Do you play?


156
0:8:55,567 --> 0:8:58,287
Oh, who the hell cares
if he plays golf?


157
0:8:58,287 --> 0:8:59,647
l was bonding.


158
0:8:59,647 --> 0:9:1,367
You're doing a good job too.


159
0:9:1,367 --> 0:9:2,807
Oh, thanks.


160
0:9:2,807 --> 0:9:4,287
Who is this clown?


161
0:9:4,287 --> 0:9:6,967
Paul here is the best
oncologist in the room,


162
0:9:6,967 --> 0:9:9,607
so why don't we all
just clam up and listen.


163
0:9:9,607 --> 0:9:13,287
- We need to start chemo.
- When?


164
0:9:13,287 --> 0:9:16,167
This afternoon.


165
0:9:16,167 --> 0:9:18,727
l'm afraid this afternoon
doesn't work for me.


166
0:9:18,727 --> 0:9:21,7
lronically, l have
a golf game to get to.


167
0:9:21,7 --> 0:9:24,7
Benji, don't sweat it.
Come on, give me a break.


168
0:9:24,7 --> 0:9:25,367
You gonna be there?


169
0:9:25,367 --> 0:9:28,247
l've got a thousand patients
to look after, so no,


170
0:9:28,247 --> 0:9:30,927
l'll probably miss this
first one, but l will leave


171
0:9:30,927 --> 0:9:35,287
my lovely and talented
assistant, Kimmy, OK?


172
0:9:35,287 --> 0:9:37,847
Yeah, sure, you know, OK.


173
0:9:37,847 --> 0:9:40,847
- Oh, am l Kimmy?
- No, l'm Kimmy.


174
0:9:40,847 --> 0:9:47,767
Oh! Good.


175
0:9:47,767 --> 0:9:50,47
Carla torched Dr Kelso for me.


176
0:9:50,47 --> 0:9:55,327
No matter what l wrote, l always
brought it back to sexual inadequacy.


177
0:9:55,327 --> 0:9:57,567
- So good.
- Hello, ladies.


178
0:9:57,567 --> 0:9:59,327
- Hey, Doug.
- Hey, Doug.


179
0:9:59,327 --> 0:10:1,527
What did you write
on Kelso's evaluation?


180
0:10:1,527 --> 0:10:4,47
- What evaluation?
- You didn't get yours yet?


181
0:10:4,47 --> 0:10:9,567
Nobody got one.


182
0:10:9,567 --> 0:10:12,327
<i>Around here bad behaviour</i>
<i>comes back to haunt you,</i>


183
0:10:12,327 --> 0:10:14,487
Dr Wen, l want
to take this opportunity


184
0:10:14,487 --> 0:10:19,87
to once again apologise to you
and the entire Asian community.


185
0:10:19,87 --> 0:10:21,967
l'll pass it on
at the next big meeting.


186
0:10:21,967 --> 0:10:23,327
You know, Christopher,


187
0:10:23,327 --> 0:10:27,687
surgeons don't have to be
shallow, rank-obsessed clichés.


188
0:10:27,687 --> 0:10:30,87
So who's the best surgical intern?


189
0:10:30,87 --> 0:10:35,47
ls it Bonnie? ls it me?
Come on, l just, l gotta know.


190
0:10:35,47 --> 0:10:40,87
The periampullary carcinoma patient
had a failed stenting of the bile duct.


191
0:10:40,87 --> 0:10:43,807
l wanna prep him for a pylorus
sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy.


192
0:10:43,807 --> 0:10:45,407
Thanks.


193
0:10:45,407 --> 0:10:53,407
Wassup, T-Man!
Show the Todd some love.


194
0:10:53,407 --> 0:10:55,687
Ben seemed
pretty down after you left,


195
0:10:55,687 --> 0:10:58,7
so l could cover
and you could hang out.


196
0:10:58,7 --> 0:11:0,87
You're a lamb,
but you don't have to.


197
0:11:0,87 --> 0:11:2,447
- l don't mind. lt's...
- Newbie, stop.


198
0:11:2,447 --> 0:11:8,687
<i>It's funny how people</i>
<i>handle bad news in different ways,</i>


199
0:11:8,687 --> 0:11:14,87
<i>Some people have</i>
<i>a visceral reaction,</i>


200
0:11:14,87 --> 0:11:17,87
Time to get my soapy-soap on.


201
0:11:17,87 --> 0:11:18,847
<i>Some people go into denial,</i>


202
0:11:18,847 --> 0:11:20,447
No way.


203
0:11:20,447 --> 0:11:22,287
<i>And others,,,</i>


204
0:11:22,287 --> 0:11:25,807
What chance do you give a guy
with Ben's blast percentage? Huh?


205
0:11:25,807 --> 0:11:28,87
Twenty percent?
Thirty...maybe?


206
0:11:28,87 --> 0:11:31,767
You see, l can't handle that.
l cannot.


207
0:11:31,767 --> 0:11:35,967
So, no thank you there, Johnny.


208
0:11:35,967 --> 0:11:43,127
<i>Others just walk away,</i>


209
0:11:43,127 --> 0:11:44,967
<i>Chemotherapy looks harmless</i>


210
0:11:44,967 --> 0:11:47,647
<i>but it's poison pumped</i>
<i>directly into your veins,</i>


211
0:11:47,647 --> 0:11:50,167
Every time l got
sick when l was a little kid,


212
0:11:50,167 --> 0:11:53,247
- Mom would get me a Tonka truck.
- Yeah, so?


213
0:11:53,247 --> 0:11:58,487
So where's my Tonka truck?


214
0:11:58,487 --> 0:12:1,687
- Score.
- The earth-mover. Can l see?


215
0:12:1,687 --> 0:12:5,767
Ah, see it with your eyes, man,
not with your hands. See?


216
0:12:5,767 --> 0:12:8,247
l can't believe Perry
bailed on you. Typical.


217
0:12:8,247 --> 0:12:12,207
He's always out the door
if things get too real.


218
0:12:12,207 --> 0:12:14,7
<i>This is the true story,</i>


219
0:12:14,7 --> 0:12:16,47
True story!


220
0:12:16,47 --> 0:12:19,247
<i>Of four people</i>
<i>forced to hang out in a hospital,</i>


221
0:12:19,247 --> 0:12:22,247
<i>To find out what happens</i>
<i>when people stop being polite,,,</i>


222
0:12:22,247 --> 0:12:27,887
<i>And start being real,</i>


223
0:12:27,887 --> 0:12:39,967
- He didn't bail.
- lf he did, he's a total wuss.


224
0:12:39,967 --> 0:12:42,847
You said you were giving
evaluations to all the interns.


225
0:12:42,847 --> 0:12:44,727
Well, not all at once, sweetheart.


226
0:12:44,727 --> 0:12:47,967
With your way there'd be no
accountability. No back and forth.


227
0:12:47,967 --> 0:12:51,327
You wouldn't have to
explain to me why, let's see...


228
0:12:51,327 --> 0:12:53,247
...''l'm most likely frustrated


229
0:12:53,247 --> 0:12:56,727
because l haven't gotten any
since the Bay of Pigs.''


230
0:12:56,727 --> 0:12:59,687
Oh, sir, l'm so sorry.


231
0:12:59,687 --> 0:13:1,567
Are we cool?


232
0:13:1,567 --> 0:13:4,527
What could have
possessed you to write such filth?


233
0:13:4,527 --> 0:13:6,527
l need to tell you something...


234
0:13:6,527 --> 0:13:11,167
No, that's OK, Carla,
l'm gonna take care of that patient.


235
0:13:11,167 --> 0:13:14,607
Dr Kelso, l did it because l didn't
think that you'd know it was me


236
0:13:14,607 --> 0:13:16,807
and l thought that it would be funny.


237
0:13:16,807 --> 0:13:18,807
Let's take a walk.


238
0:13:18,807 --> 0:13:27,887
l'd like to tell you a few things
that l think are funny.


239
0:13:27,887 --> 0:13:31,287
Oh, come on, how could
this guy be the best?


240
0:13:31,287 --> 0:13:33,887
You want to know
the difference between you?


241
0:13:33,887 --> 0:13:37,247
When you're working l can
always see your wheels turning.


242
0:13:37,247 --> 0:13:40,7
You're thinking about what to do next,
what could go wrong.


243
0:13:40,7 --> 0:13:41,327
You're not in the moment.


244
0:13:41,327 --> 0:13:46,407
And as much as it pains me
to say this, the Todd is.


245
0:13:46,407 --> 0:13:49,607
<i>Please, Just because I'm thorough</i>


246
0:13:49,607 --> 0:13:51,807
<i>and want to keep two</i>
<i>Kelly clamps on</i>


247
0:13:51,807 --> 0:13:54,567
<i>in case the appendiceal artery</i>
<i>is inadvertently incised</i>


248
0:13:54,567 --> 0:13:59,887
<i>so I can gain immediate haemostatic</i>
<i>control doesn't mean I think too much,</i>


249
0:13:59,887 --> 0:14:1,887
<i>Shiny scalpel</i>


250
0:14:1,887 --> 0:14:7,167
<i>Dum de de dum de de dum</i>
<i>De de dum gonna slice him up</i>


251
0:14:7,167 --> 0:14:9,727
- You're afraid of escalators.
- That's not uncommon.


252
0:14:9,727 --> 0:14:11,807
You like feel of cashmere
on your skin.


253
0:14:11,807 --> 0:14:14,887
- How are you doing this?
- That's right, you run away!


254
0:14:14,887 --> 0:14:17,487
Run away from the truth!


255
0:14:17,487 --> 0:14:20,367
Look, Dr Cox, l've been
doing a lot of thinking,


256
0:14:20,367 --> 0:14:24,967
and l think the only reason you're
not down at that hospital right now


257
0:14:24,967 --> 0:14:27,47
is that you're afraid.


258
0:14:27,47 --> 0:14:31,127
l think you're right. l do.


259
0:14:31,127 --> 0:14:35,327
That's partly because you've
really gotten to know me this year,


260
0:14:35,327 --> 0:14:39,167
but mostly it's because, well...


261
0:14:39,167 --> 0:14:41,527
...l told you that
l was afraid earlier.


262
0:14:41,527 --> 0:14:44,367
Don't tell me you've come here
to reiterate things


263
0:14:44,367 --> 0:14:47,567
l've already said, because
l know the things that l've said.


264
0:14:47,567 --> 0:14:51,527
ln fact, l'm the one who said them.


265
0:14:51,527 --> 0:14:54,447
You've got to get back
in the game, Coxie.


266
0:14:54,447 --> 0:14:57,567
''Coxie'' was a mistake.
Pretend l didn't say Coxie.


267
0:14:57,567 --> 0:14:59,7
Get out.


268
0:14:59,7 --> 0:15:2,687
Look, l... lt boggles my mind
that you would just bail on a patient.


269
0:15:2,687 --> 0:15:5,47
A patient is a stranger in a bed


270
0:15:5,47 --> 0:15:7,767
that you can distance yourself
from when you need to.


271
0:15:7,767 --> 0:15:11,567
Ben is my friend.


272
0:15:11,567 --> 0:15:14,607
l'm gonna try to visit him
over the next couple of weeks,


273
0:15:14,607 --> 0:15:19,47
but if l can't,
then that'll be very sad for me,


274
0:15:19,47 --> 0:15:23,687
but really,
it'll just mean that l'm human.


275
0:15:23,687 --> 0:15:26,847
Oh, and newbie,


276
0:15:26,847 --> 0:15:30,887
please don't think that you've
come here because Ben needs me.


277
0:15:30,887 --> 0:15:32,767
You're here because
you're scared


278
0:15:32,767 --> 0:15:36,7
that you might have to rely
on yourself for the first time.


279
0:15:36,7 --> 0:15:37,687
And that...


280
0:15:37,687 --> 0:15:48,127
That is just the
saddest thing of all.


281
0:15:48,127 --> 0:15:52,487
<i>I think one of the most universal</i>
<i>human experiences is feeling alone,</i>


282
0:15:52,487 --> 0:15:55,247
<i>You'd never know</i>
<i>but there's tons of people</i>


283
0:15:55,247 --> 0:15:58,287
<i>feeling the exact same way,</i>


284
0:15:58,287 --> 0:16:1,887
<i>Maybe because you're</i>
<i>feeling completely abandoned,</i>


285
0:16:1,887 --> 0:16:6,607
<i>Maybe you realised that you aren't</i>
<i>as self-sufficient as you thought,</i>


286
0:16:6,607 --> 0:16:9,927
<i>Maybe you know you should've</i>
<i>handled something differently,</i>


287
0:16:9,927 --> 0:16:12,687
<i>Or maybe you aren't</i>
<i>as good as you thought you were,</i>


288
0:16:12,687 --> 0:16:15,487
<i>Either way when you hit</i>
<i>that low point you have a choice,</i>


289
0:16:15,487 --> 0:16:21,167
<i>You can either wallow</i>
<i>in self-pity or you can suck it up,</i>


290
0:16:21,167 --> 0:16:25,127
<i>It's your call,</i>


291
0:16:25,127 --> 0:16:28,567
You know what, Dr Wen? l don't care
if l'm not the best right now,


292
0:16:28,567 --> 0:16:31,7
because l'm all about the upside,
and one day,


293
0:16:31,7 --> 0:16:34,87
l'm going to own this place.
That's right. All of this here,


294
0:16:34,87 --> 0:16:35,647
all of this right here


295
0:16:35,647 --> 0:16:42,887
is gonna be
the Chris Turk Wing.


296
0:16:42,887 --> 0:16:49,327
Dr Kelso, l wrote that evaluation.
lt was me. Elliot didn't write a word.


297
0:16:49,327 --> 0:16:52,447
But l would've written every word
if l'd had the courage...


298
0:16:52,447 --> 0:16:55,607
...and the other-side-of-the-tracks
upbringing Carla did.


299
0:16:55,607 --> 0:17:2,767
- You want to know what l think of you?
- You tell him.


300
0:17:2,767 --> 0:17:4,247
You're mean.


301
0:17:4,247 --> 0:17:9,87
<i>As for me I decided</i>
<i>that if Dr Cox couldn't do it</i>


302
0:17:9,87 --> 0:17:41,767
<i>well then I would have</i>
<i>to be the one there for Ben,</i>


303
0:17:41,767 --> 0:17:44,687
- Oh, thank God.
- Goodbye, newbie.


304
0:17:44,687 --> 0:17:49,527
So, you know, what's up?


305
0:17:49,527 --> 0:17:52,607
You know, this and that.
Hey, l met someone.


306
0:17:52,607 --> 0:17:54,327
- Really?
- Yeah.


307
0:17:54,327 --> 0:17:57,767
But she took a stool sample
so l think she works here.


308
0:17:57,767 --> 0:18:1,687
Redhead? Tall?


309
0:18:1,687 --> 0:18:5,247
- Not on the staff, no.
- No?


310
0:18:5,247 --> 0:18:7,167
What a strange young lady.


311
0:18:7,167 --> 0:18:8,967
Are we just gonna sit around here


312
0:18:8,967 --> 0:18:12,247
and make jokes the rest of the day?
ls that the drill?


313
0:18:12,247 --> 0:18:17,487
Listen, if it makes you uncomfortable,
then you can just bolt again.


314
0:18:17,487 --> 0:18:20,567
l think it's only fair you hear
my end of the story there.


315
0:18:20,567 --> 0:18:29,367
All right, fine.


316
0:18:29,367 --> 0:18:32,47
Aw, man, l love you,


317
0:18:32,47 --> 0:18:35,127
but you're a complete wuss.


318
0:18:35,127 --> 0:18:38,247
l guess l got a little scared.


319
0:18:38,247 --> 0:18:40,727
Well, let me know
if there's anything l can do


320
0:18:40,727 --> 0:18:43,7
to help you through this rough patch.


321
0:18:43,7 --> 0:18:46,47
Give me a break. l'm not
good at this stuff. You know that.


322
0:18:46,47 --> 0:18:49,87
- lt's OK.
- l don't like the big conversations.


323
0:18:49,87 --> 0:18:56,447
lt's cool.


324
0:18:56,447 --> 0:18:58,847
l've been thinking
about death a lot lately.


325
0:18:58,847 --> 0:19:1,887
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.


326
0:19:1,887 --> 0:19:4,927
You think it's like New York,
you know...


327
0:19:4,927 --> 0:19:9,7
<i>To most people it might</i>
<i>have seemed like nothing had changed,</i>


328
0:19:9,7 --> 0:19:16,87
Well, Dr Murphy?


329
0:19:16,87 --> 0:19:19,87
- <i>But it had a little,</i>
- Go on.


330
0:19:19,87 --> 0:19:23,367
Could it be lupus?


331
0:19:23,367 --> 0:19:37,847
Good job, sport.


332
0:19:37,847 --> 0:19:42,527
<i>As for Ben he actually responded</i>
<i>to the chemo and went into remission,</i>


333
0:19:42,527 --> 0:19:45,407
<i>Hopefully he won't be back</i>
<i>but who knows?</i>


334
0:19:45,407 --> 0:19:48,247
<i>Still that's not</i>
<i>what this story's about,</i>


335
0:19:48,247 --> 0:19:51,127
<i>It's about the day I realised</i>
<i>that admitting we're not heroic</i>


336
0:19:51,127 --> 0:20:6,967
<i>is when we're</i>
<i>the most heroic of all,</i>


337
0:20:6,967 --> 0:20:9,647
<i>I guess he'll always,,,</i>


338
0:20:9,647 --> 0:20:31,927
<i>,,,be a hero to me,</i>


339
0:20:31,927 --> 0:20:34,927
''Always be a hero to me.''


340
0:20:34,927 --> 0:20:36,767
What a girl!


341
0:20:36,767 --> 0:20:39,887
What else we got?


342
0:20:39,887 --> 0:20:42,247
Theatre camp.


343
0:20:42,247 --> 0:22:42,247
Bingo.
