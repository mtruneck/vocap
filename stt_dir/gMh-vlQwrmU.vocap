###7 SHANE SMITH: Last time we talked to you, Mr. Ben
###8 Anderson, you had just come back from doing a documentary
###13 on Afghanistan, following the British troops there.
###17 And it was a bit of a cock-up.
###20 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.
###21 SHANE SMITH: And now you just got back from Dubai.
###23 BEN ANDERSON: Yep.
###24 SHANE SMITH: Now most people know about Dubai because
###26 they're trying to be the hub of the Middle East.
###29 And you went and found out some stuff about?
###32 BEN ANDERSON: The guys actually building the big,
###34 shiny skyscrapers and the world's biggest mall and the
###36 world's biggest aquarium and all that stuff.
###38 The guys who are being paid almost nothing to build it.
###41 SHANE SMITH: So they're being built by slaves.
###45 BEN ANDERSON: That's not an exaggeration.
###46 Yeah.
###47 SHANE SMITH: Really.
###48 BEN ANDERSON: Once they find themselves out there, and they
###49 realize how much they're getting paid or how much
###51 they're not getting paid, they're indebted by the time
###53 they arrive there.
###54 So it is bonded labor.
###55 
###68 We focused on the Bangladeshi workers.
###70 The local agents approach them in their villages.
###72 Say, you've heard about Dubai, you've heard
###74 how amazing it is.
###74 I can get you a job out there where you get paid
###76 300 pounds a month.
###78 Which to them is an amazing salary.
###80 Pay me 2,000 pounds, 200,000 taka, local money, I'll get
###84 you out there.
###84 It'll take you six months, a year, to pay
###86 off the 2,000 pounds.
###87 Then you'll start sending loads of money home.
###89 And before you know it, you'll be buying your family a shop
###92 or a farm or whatever it is.
###94 As soon as they land, their passports are taken away.
###97 They also then find out they're getting paid between
###99 120 and 160 pounds a month.
###102 And this is for six days a week, 12 hours a day, and
###106 living eight men to a room and in what we saw were absolutely
###109 squalid conditions.
###111 The dream of escaping the dreary British winters and
###114 joining the celebs in the sun is one many Brits share.
###117 So I pretended to be one of them and signed up for a First
###120 Group tour that they promised would show me a side of Dubai
###123 which simply can't be revealed from a web site
###125 or newspaper article.
###128 The First Group sales team are adamant the workers building
###130 their project were treated well.
###132 
###152 SHANE SMITH: This is what I found interesting about this
###153 is, this is a common perception, even when I was
###157 there in Dubai, is that, oh, it's good for them.
###160 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.
###160 Looks bad to us, but--
###161 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, it looks bad to us but, yeah,
###163 it's good for them.
###165 BEN ANDERSON: We can't get onsite to
###166 interview the workers.
###167 We're going to wait until they knock off, follow them back to
###169 their labor camp and see what conditions are like on this,
###173 which is one of the most high-profile projects in the
###175 whole of Dubai.
###177 
###179 This is pretty much how we worked for over a period of
###182 three months out there.
###183 Sneak in or speak to them before they went into the
###186 labor camp.
###186 Because there's a camp boss at every single gate, stopping
###189 people going in.
###190 SHANE SMITH: You're not allowed to talk to them?
###191 BEN ANDERSON: No, no, no, no.
###192 So we would try and grab them before they went in and say--
###195 SHANE SMITH: What would happen if you got caught?
###198 BEN ANDERSON: Well, journalists in the past have
###199 been imprisoned and been slapped with massive, massive
###203 fines out there.
###205 First impressions are, if you didn't know it was a place
###208 where workers lived, you'd think it was a place where
###211 machinery was stored.
###212 No street lights, can even smels the sewage.
###217 Just sheets of corrugated iron protecting rows of huts.
###222 It looks like a shanty town.
###224 
###234 So how many?
###234 There's two, four, six eight, eight people in this room?
###238 WORKER 1: Nine.
###239 BEN ANDERSON: Nine people.
###240 But before we could interview the workers, the
###241 camp boss turned up.
###243 
###259 There was fear among the unit workers about speaking to us.
###262 They felt they could be sacked and sent home if they were
###264 discovered speaking out.
###267 That shot is basically my vision of Dubai now.
###271 All the glittering skyscrapers on the horizon, and you're in
###273 this sort of black hole a few miles away.
###276 Which is where these guys live.
###277 
###295 SHANE SMITH: So what are we going to see now?
###295 BEN ANDERSON: We met an Indian agent who's been sending
###298 workers to Dubai for years, making a lot of money.
###301 And they complained to her a lot, and she just put it down
###303 to them whinging.
###304 But these guys were particularly persistent, so
###306 she thought she'd investigate.
###308 When she finally found these guys-- it took her two months
###310 to find these guys-- it made her so angry that she's now
###313 the first-- as far as I know--
###314 first agent to speak out about this, and speak out with us.
###318 As we drove into it, she said, that building over
###320 there, that's it.
###321 You wouldn't even keep cattle in that building.
###325 The story of the migrant workers is the
###326 dark side of Dubai.
###328 The side which the annual 1.1 million British visitors to
###332 this country never see.
###333 
###337 ALMASS PARDIWALA: We'll see the living conditions are
###339 really, really appalling.
###340 Almost inhuman conditions they're been living out here.
###343 
###346 This is their very, very, very basic toilet facilities
###352 available to them.
###353 BEN ANDERSON: That's the toilet.
###354 Two toilets and one shower unit for 45 people.
###357 ALMASS PARDIWALA: 45 people.
###360 Right now, I seriously wish the world would wake up and
###364 look beyond the glitter to the actual darkness
###366 which is there behind.
###367 I seriously don't think there is a lot of moral
###371 consciousness amongst the employers over here.
###375 And I would not say just one of the companies.
###379 Most of the companies have absolutely no regard for the
###382 human life or the human element of this job.
###384 That doesn't [INAUDIBLE].
###386 Absolutely no regard.
###387 No.
###389 BEN ANDERSON: You see they're building a fire there.
###391 There is a hob in the building, but there's no gas.
###394 They company doesn't supply them with gas.
###396 So they just build themselves a fire out in the back yard.
###398 And that's how they cook for all 45 men.
###400 SHANE SMITH: So they don't have water, they don't have
###403 cooking facilities?
###405 BEN ANDERSON: No.
###405 No.
###406 They're completely independent.
###407 Whatever they get, they scrape together themselves.
###409 We spoke to guys who said, all month, they eat
###411 bread, rice, potatoes.
###413 That's all they eat.
###414 I said, what about meat or fish?
###415 Don't you eat ever meat or fish?
###416 They said, two or three times a month they
###418 can eat meat or fish.
###419 And we went into one kitchen, and we saw the guys cooking
###422 their luxury portion of fish for the month.
###425 And it was like four guppies.
###427 I mean, four fish like this big.
###429 That was all it was.
###431 They're easy prey for recruitment agents in their
###433 home countries, who charge them huge fees just for the
###436 privilege of working in Dubai.
###439 On average, they pay around 2,000 pounds, a sum of money
###442 so high that they have to take out loans or sell
###445 family land to pay it.
###448 There are an estimated three million of these workers in
###451 the United Arab Emirates.
###453 So if they're paying 2,000 pounds each, that's some
###455 serious money.
###456 SHANE SMITH: What's that for?
###458 BEN ANDERSON: It's called a visa fee.
###459 And it's supposed to cover the visa and the flight.
###461 Which, of course, is much less than 2,000 pounds.
###463 But that's what it's called, the visa fee.
###466 It's actually the fee for the agent to arrange the privilege
###470 of being able to go and work in this paradise.
###472 SHANE SMITH: And is there actually a visa fee that they
###475 have to pay the government?
###476 BEN ANDERSON: It's illegal for the company or its
###478 representatives to charge the workers for
###480 the visa or the transport.
###482 NICK MCGEEHAN: There would be a contract
###483 signed in the host state.
###485 And he would then be flown to Dubai.
###487 On arrival in Dubai, that contract would
###489 effectively be ripped up.
###490 He would be paid sometimes half of what the intended
###494 salary was.
###495 And his passport would also be confiscated.
###498 BEN ANDERSON: This Scottish guy is very interesting.
###500 Almass, the Indian agent, was so outraged by what she found
###502 when she found these workers, that she wrote to everybody
###505 she could think of.
###506 I mean, obviously everyone in the Dubai government, but
###508 Amnesty International, Human Rights-- everybody.
###510 Nobody replied.
###511 He's the only person that replied.
###513 He used to work for an oil company in Abu Dhabi and was
###515 so outraged by what he saw being done to the workers,
###518 that he's now set up an NGO called Mafiwasta.
###521 And he was the only one that replied to Almass.
###523 SHANE SMITH: Wow.
###524 So nobody cares.
###525 BEN ANDERSON: No.
###526 SHANE SMITH: So they're the forgotten slaves of Dubai.
###527 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah, yeah.
###528 Well, they're largely not known in the first place.
###531 These men were shunted from camp to camp, before ending up
###534 here, either jobless or forced to serve out their contracts.
###539 The families they left behind do not receive
###541 any money from them.
###542 There is no get-out clause.
###544 Even if their passports were returned to them, they
###546 couldn't afford to go home.
###549 They're trapped.
###551 ALMASS PARDIWALA: Basically, yes, you can say they are in
###552 kind of a bondage to the company for the span of the
###556 contract that they are here.
###557 BEN ANDERSON: Isn't holding passports
###559 supposed to be illegal?
###559 ALMASS PARDIWALA: Illegal?
###560 Yes.
###560 There are a lot of things which are supposed to be
###562 illegal, but they still happen here.
###563 And it's very regular.
###565 BEN ANDERSON: That happens very often.
###566 There are some laws in place.
###568 For example, there was a law introduced recently where, if
###571 the temperature goes above 50 degrees, I think it is, the
###574 workers are supposed to down tools and rest
###576 until it gets cooler.
###578 As a result, the temperature never went above 50 degrees.
###581 SHANE SMITH: How can it not go above--
###581 BEN ANDERSON: Well, officially it never
###582 went above 50 degrees.
###583 I mean, it did go above 50 degrees.
###585 But according to official records, it never went above
###587 50 degrees.
###587 So the workers never stopped working.
###590 WORKER 1: [SPEAKIING BENGALI]
###593 TRANSLATOR: There is nothing for me.
###594 I've borrowed from other people to buy food.
###596 It's been five months, and he has not paid me at all.
###598 
###602 I have begged for good or remained hungry.
###605 Somehow or other, I'm surviving.
###608 My wife and children tell me to send some
###609 money or come back.
###611 Where will I go?
###612 [CRYING]
###614 
###628 BEN ANDERSON: It took an hour for the workers to travel back
###630 to their camp.
###631 They wanted to speak out but didn't dare reveal their
###634 identities.
###636 Like every other worker we spoke to in Dubai, they were
###639 in debt and claimed they were not being paid the money they
###641 were promised by their recruiting agents.
###644 So I grabbed a hard hat and snuck into the camp with a
###646 secret camera.
###648 SHANE SMITH: Did you have to shoot a lot on hidden camera?
###650 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.
###650 I mean, a lot of the interviews, all of the footage
###652 inside the camps were on a hidden camera.
###654 SHANE SMITH: Because if you get caught,
###655 you can get in trouble.
###656 BEN ANDERSON: And allegedly, the government have got paid
###658 informants all over the place.
###660 In hotels, taxis, everywhere.
###661 So yeah, you've got to be really careful out there.
###664 So basically the big sort of main thoroughfare that
###667 separates the accommodation from the toilets is just all
###673 deep, thick mud and, they say, urine and
###676 shit from the toilets.
###678 Actually, the areas around the toilets are the wettest,
###681 muddiest, and smelliest areas, so [INAUDIBLE]
###685 telling the truth.
###687 There were so many rivers of sewage blocking so many of the
###690 walkways that workers had actually set up a network of
###693 stepping stones to get back to their accommodation.
###696 SHANE SMITH: So it must have reeked.
###698 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.
###699 Horrible.
###699 They said to me, this is all raw sewage.
###702 And I didn't know whether they were telling the truth or not.
###704 As soon as you get close to it, it hits you.
###707 SHANE SMITH: So their toilets are just going
###708 out onto the streets?
###709 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.
###712 The areas between the toilet blocks were the most
###714 disgusting.
###715 There was no doubt that this is where the problem was
###717 coming from.
###718 
###723 I wonder if the water works?
###727 They can't flush it away after they've used the toilet.
###730 I tried to check every single tap.
###732 A lot of them, there was no tap to turn.
###734 A lot of them, you turn it and no water comes out.
###736 So yeah, they can't flush it away, and it just sits there.
###738 I got to, I admit, the fourth or fifth toilet, and I just
###742 started retching because I couldn't take it anymore.
###744 [SOUND OF RETCHING]
###749 SHANE SMITH: And you're not a squeamish guy.
###751 You've been to Afghanistan, you've been to the Congo,
###753 you've been to all the bad places on Earth.
###755 BEN ANDERSON: I worked as an undertaker with dead bodies.
###756 SHANE SMITH: You worked as an undertaker.
###758 So this has got to be pretty bad.
###760 BEN ANDERSON: And the workers I spoke to that night said,
###762 this is good, compared to how it has been.
###766 In a statement, the company blamed the workers, saying
###769 their "standards of cleanliness and hygiene are
###772 not up to your or our standards.
###775 It is very difficult to change the habits that they
###777 unfortunately bring with them from their countries of
###779 origin."
###782 Panorama has obtained documents which reveal it's
###784 more likely to be Arabtec's own cleaning regime which is
###787 the problem.
###788 A day before I'd filmed in the camp toilets in January, the
###792 Dubai authorities warned Arabtec about insufficient
###794 cleaning of toilets.
###796 SHANE SMITH: So the government knows about it.
###798 What are they doing about it?
###800 BEN ANDERSON: We were quite impressed that the government
###801 had been there and said the situation was critical.
###803 But they fined them 2,000 pounds.
###805 SHANE SMITH: And they hadn't done anything?
###806 BEN ANDERSON: No.
###806 It was still awful a month later.
###808 And we've put these allegations to the company,
###810 and they basically say it's the workers fault.
###812 Trade unions and collective bargaining
###814 are illegal in Dubai.
###816 With the companies themselves now suffering because of the
###818 international financial crisis, the consequences of
###821 complaining are worse than ever before.
###823 WORKER 1: [SPEAKING BENGALI]
###826 TRANSLATOR: They're telling, now that you have come, you
###829 stay and work.
###830 If we find any mistakes in your work, then finish.
###833 Back to Bangladesh.
###834 We will no longer keep you.
###836 If you work well, if the company prospers in the
###839 future, we will see what can be arranged for you.
###843 BEN ANDERSON: Do you think there's a chance things could
###844 improve for you here?
###845 WORKER 1: [SPEAKING BENGALI]
###846 TRANSLATOR: We have no hope for the future.
###848 We are helpless.
###850 SHANE SMITH: So you've got three million workers that are
###853 brought over.
###854 Their passports are taken away.
###856 They're not getting paid the money that they should.
###859 In fact, they don't have enough money really, to eat.
###861 They have squalid conditions, raw sewage.
###865 You just came back from there.
###866 How do you feel coming back from the City of Lights?
###871 BEN ANDERSON: The reality of Dubai is the complete opposite
###873 to what you see on television and in magazines.
###875 In fact, I asked the Indian agent, I said, what do you
###877 think of now when you see all these glossy pictures and
###880 videos from Dubai?
###881 She said, now I just see skeletons.
###882
