2
0:0:2,34 --> 0:0:5,7
KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: If we
wanted to fly into space, we


3
0:0:5,7 --> 0:0:7,45
could either try to
become astronauts.


4
0:0:7,45 --> 0:0:8,97
Like, ha ha, good luck.


5
0:0:8,97 --> 0:0:11,18
It is probably not
going to happen.


6
0:0:11,18 --> 0:0:14,95
You could also wait until maybe
Virgin Galactic finishes


7
0:0:14,95 --> 0:0:16,27
their project.


8
0:0:16,27 --> 0:0:17,65
That's going to take
a long time.


9
0:0:17,65 --> 0:0:20,17
But wouldn't it be much more fun
if you just created your


10
0:0:20,17 --> 0:0:23,8
own spacecraft yourself, your
own space rocket, fly into


11
0:0:23,8 --> 0:0:24,582
space doing that?


12
0:0:24,582 --> 0:0:25,832
-Go.


13
0:0:25,832 --> 0:0:48,62



14
0:0:48,62 --> 0:0:51,68
KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: Working
metal doesn't sound very sexy,


15
0:0:51,68 --> 0:0:56,28
but it's actually one of the
best skills that I've obtained


16
0:0:56,28 --> 0:0:58,78
through life, except sketching
and drawing.


17
0:0:58,78 --> 0:1:2,61
I mean, creating anything
in metal is just--


18
0:1:2,61 --> 0:1:4,862
there's no limits to what
you can actually do


19
0:1:4,862 --> 0:1:7,15
if you have an idea.


20
0:1:7,15 --> 0:1:11,79
And of course, wood is nice, but
you're not going to go far


21
0:1:11,79 --> 0:1:15,6
in a space rocket
made of wood.


22
0:1:15,6 --> 0:1:16,71
Yeah, my name is Kristian
von Bengtson.


23
0:1:16,71 --> 0:1:22,25
I'm a co-founder of Copenhagen
Suborbitals, a non-profit and


24
0:1:22,25 --> 0:1:26,12
open-source DIY space program.


25
0:1:26,12 --> 0:1:30,7
We're not doing open-source
space flights at the moment.


26
0:1:30,7 --> 0:1:31,29
We're not aiming for
it right now.


27
0:1:31,29 --> 0:1:32,77
We're doing suborbital
space flight.


28
0:1:32,77 --> 0:1:36,24
That's a parabolic flight where
you go up and down, a


29
0:1:36,24 --> 0:1:37,49
short trip.


30
0:1:37,49 --> 0:1:41,27



31
0:1:41,27 --> 0:1:46,33
Copenhagen Suborbitals was
founded in 2008 by myself and


32
0:1:46,33 --> 0:1:48,2
my partner, Peter Madsen.


33
0:1:48,2 --> 0:1:52,23
I was back in Denmark after
I've been working at NASA


34
0:1:52,23 --> 0:1:53,56
Johnson Space Center.


35
0:1:53,56 --> 0:1:58,53
And at that time, I read in
an article that Peter was


36
0:1:58,53 --> 0:2:3,46
launching his first and last
submarine nautilus.


37
0:2:3,46 --> 0:2:8,47
And in that article, I read that
Peter had a prior history


38
0:2:8,47 --> 0:2:12,68
doing rocket engines, and he
wanted to work again with


39
0:2:12,68 --> 0:2:14,5
rocket engines.


40
0:2:14,5 --> 0:2:20,1
So I thought to myself,
let me talk to Peter.


41
0:2:20,1 --> 0:2:23,13
And I contacted him, and we
met in his submarine.


42
0:2:23,13 --> 0:2:25,33
And basically, within
a few hours, we


43
0:2:25,33 --> 0:2:28,4
decided to join forces.


44
0:2:28,4 --> 0:2:30,25
He would be creating the
launch vehicles.


45
0:2:30,25 --> 0:2:33,2
I would be creating the
space capsules.


46
0:2:33,2 --> 0:2:35,1
And from that moment,
actually, Copenhagen


47
0:2:35,1 --> 0:2:36,41
Suborbitals was founded.


48
0:2:36,41 --> 0:2:43,7



49
0:2:43,7 --> 0:2:45,32
PETER MADSEN: My name
is Peter Madsen.


50
0:2:45,32 --> 0:2:47,62
I'm with Copenhagen
Suborbitals.


51
0:2:47,62 --> 0:2:51,37
My part of it is the rocket
engines that propel the


52
0:2:51,37 --> 0:2:52,47
spacecraft.


53
0:2:52,47 --> 0:2:56,14
And it's also the construction
of launch pads and all the


54
0:2:56,14 --> 0:2:59,79
systems, essentially, that
takes the spacecraft from


55
0:2:59,79 --> 0:3:1,54
planet Earth and into Space.


56
0:3:1,54 --> 0:3:10,19



57
0:3:10,19 --> 0:3:12,48
Well, I'm not obsessed.


58
0:3:12,48 --> 0:3:13,79
Not at all.


59
0:3:13,79 --> 0:3:17,22
It's all the other people who
are obsessed with footballs


60
0:3:17,22 --> 0:3:18,31
and that sort of thing.


61
0:3:18,31 --> 0:3:21,17
I'm just doing what I've
always been doing.


62
0:3:21,17 --> 0:3:22,42
I'm playing.


63

64
0:3:30,3 --> 0:3:31,55
-[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


65
0:3:31,55 --> 0:3:34,94



66
0:3:34,94 --> 0:3:39,17
PETER MADSEN: This is the
TM65 rocket engine.


67
0:3:39,17 --> 0:3:43,95
It uses two components
for its propellants.


68
0:3:43,95 --> 0:3:47,26
The one is liquid oxygen.


69
0:3:47,26 --> 0:3:50,14
And the other is alcohol,
the same type of


70
0:3:50,14 --> 0:3:51,73
alcohol that we drink.


71
0:3:51,73 --> 0:3:54,38
But this is just slightly
more concentrated.


72
0:3:54,38 --> 0:3:57,43
So it's a schnapps
locks engine.


73
0:3:57,43 --> 0:4:3,57



74
0:4:3,57 --> 0:4:8,0
This engine really works the
same way as the engines that


75
0:4:8,0 --> 0:4:11,3
originally propelled the Saturn
V Rocket to the moon.


76
0:4:11,3 --> 0:4:14,25
It's the same type
of technology.


77
0:4:14,25 --> 0:4:17,54
The difference from the Space
Shuttle main engines to this


78
0:4:17,54 --> 0:4:23,36
one is that while a shuttle
engine consists of literally


79
0:4:23,36 --> 0:4:26,36
tens of thousands of components,
this one is a


80
0:4:26,36 --> 0:4:28,9
couple of hundred components.


81
0:4:28,9 --> 0:4:31,11
All the parts that this engine
is consisting of--


82
0:4:31,11 --> 0:4:34,6
primarily the valves, the
actuator, the nuts and bolts,


83
0:4:34,6 --> 0:4:36,37
the tubes and pipes
and everything--


84
0:4:36,37 --> 0:4:39,75
are all the products of modern
industry, and they're all off


85
0:4:39,75 --> 0:4:41,14
the shelf things.


86
0:4:41,14 --> 0:4:43,69
If it wasn't used in this rocket
engine, very likely


87
0:4:43,69 --> 0:4:47,9
this component would have found
its way into an ordinary


88
0:4:47,9 --> 0:4:51,85
house for heating purposes
or the water


89
0:4:51,85 --> 0:4:53,52
mains used in a kitchen.


90
0:4:53,52 --> 0:4:56,88
It's the sort of things that are
completely normal that we


91
0:4:56,88 --> 0:5:0,8
put together and turn into
a rocket engine.


92
0:5:0,8 --> 0:5:2,97
KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: Using
off the shelf products that


93
0:5:2,97 --> 0:5:4,98
you can buy in vast numbers
are actually


94
0:5:4,98 --> 0:5:6,37
very reliable systems.


95
0:5:6,37 --> 0:5:10,48
Instead of trying to invent our
own valve, for instance,


96
0:5:10,48 --> 0:5:12,54
why not buy one that's
been produced


97
0:5:12,54 --> 0:5:16,44
maybe a million times?


98
0:5:16,44 --> 0:5:20,12
When you're working a DIY
project, the natural premise


99
0:5:20,12 --> 0:5:22,14
is that you don't have much.


100
0:5:22,14 --> 0:5:24,17
You don't have much
money, funding.


101
0:5:24,17 --> 0:5:28,8
You don't have, maybe, all the
technology like the pro guys,


102
0:5:28,8 --> 0:5:28,98
or the materials.


103
0:5:28,98 --> 0:5:31,53
And then you have to come
up with solutions.


104
0:5:31,53 --> 0:5:36,81
And that sparks a lot of new
technology, new ideas.


105
0:5:36,81 --> 0:5:43,77
And sometimes it also takes the
solution that you would


106
0:5:43,77 --> 0:5:46,7
normally do--


107
0:5:46,7 --> 0:5:49,28
very expensive, very complex
in the professional world--


108
0:5:49,28 --> 0:5:52,51
and bring it down to a level
and show people that it's


109
0:5:52,51 --> 0:5:54,9
actually possible
to do the same--


110
0:5:54,9 --> 0:5:59,43
come up with same solution
for less money.


111
0:5:59,43 --> 0:6:3,83
The first rocket we tried to
launch, it contained a hair


112
0:6:3,83 --> 0:6:9,63
dryer to keep one of the
valves heated up so it


113
0:6:9,63 --> 0:6:11,255
wouldn't freeze up.


114
0:6:11,255 --> 0:6:12,9
It was actually a
great solution.


115
0:6:12,9 --> 0:6:24,19



116
0:6:24,19 --> 0:6:26,265
PETER MADSEN: We have left the
workshop now, and we have


117
0:6:26,265 --> 0:6:29,46
walked about 100 meters to one
of the two test stands.


118
0:6:29,46 --> 0:6:33,24
And what we have is
a steel gantry.


119
0:6:33,24 --> 0:6:38,28
And up there, a room for the the
four 16 millimeter bolts


120
0:6:38,28 --> 0:6:39,46
that keep the engine in place.


121
0:6:39,46 --> 0:6:42,552
And we have a crane that we
use to hoist it up there.


122
0:6:42,552 --> 0:6:45,65
And on top of this steel
structure, we have the


123
0:6:45,65 --> 0:6:49,89
propellant tanks of, totally,
700 kilos of propellant that


124
0:6:49,89 --> 0:7:7,69
the engine consumes in
about 15 seconds.


125
0:7:7,69 --> 0:7:11,65
[APPLAUSE]


126
0:7:11,65 --> 0:7:14,19
KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: Launching
rockets is actually


127
0:7:14,19 --> 0:7:15,63
like anything else
we're doing here.


128
0:7:15,63 --> 0:7:17,24
It's tests of different
systems.


129
0:7:17,24 --> 0:7:22,12



130
0:7:22,12 --> 0:7:25,6
We have to prove to ourselves
that we are capable of


131
0:7:25,6 --> 0:7:26,68
handling different
technologies.


132
0:7:26,68 --> 0:7:30,15

134
0:7:33,56 --> 0:7:37,1
KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: There's
always certain things we are


135
0:7:37,1 --> 0:7:39,0
testing on.


136
0:7:39,0 --> 0:7:42,26
So it's all a part of the big
puzzle ending up for a big


137
0:7:42,26 --> 0:7:45,16
rocket with a capsule on top.


138
0:7:45,16 --> 0:7:47,15
And of course, we're going
to do more launches.


139
0:7:47,15 --> 0:7:56,1



140
0:7:56,1 --> 0:7:57,92
PETER MADSEN: We are aiming
for a manned mission.


141
0:7:57,92 --> 0:8:0,94
But of course, we are only
flying the big rockets with a


142
0:8:0,94 --> 0:8:2,89
crash test dummy inside.


143
0:8:2,89 --> 0:8:5,52
We're not going to be flying
any persons, any live human


144
0:8:5,52 --> 0:8:10,59
being, until we believe
that it's fairly safe.


145
0:8:10,59 --> 0:8:12,19
KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: This
is is our space capsule,


146
0:8:12,19 --> 0:8:13,53
Beautiful Betty.


147
0:8:13,53 --> 0:8:17,15
And it's the first prototype of
this kind of capsule-type


148
0:8:17,15 --> 0:8:18,7
space vehicle for one person.


149
0:8:18,7 --> 0:8:20,6
Most of this--


150
0:8:20,6 --> 0:8:20,78
the capsule--


151
0:8:20,78 --> 0:8:21,75
I welded myself.


152
0:8:21,75 --> 0:8:23,9
But I did the sign--


153
0:8:23,9 --> 0:8:25,78
and some of the interior
welding--


154
0:8:25,78 --> 0:8:27,57
I did with a guy called Klaus.


155
0:8:27,57 --> 0:8:31,22
He's my partner in doing
these capsules here.


156
0:8:31,22 --> 0:8:33,65
And we're also together
developing the new capsule.


157
0:8:33,65 --> 0:8:36,2
It was tested about
two months ago.


158
0:8:36,2 --> 0:8:38,419
It got pretty roughed up.


159
0:8:38,419 --> 0:8:39,38
But it's still here.


160
0:8:39,38 --> 0:8:41,23
And we can still do
a lot of tests.


161
0:8:41,23 --> 0:8:43,74
And it's a foundation of all the
new capsules we're going


162
0:8:43,74 --> 0:8:44,99
to do in the future.


163
0:8:44,99 --> 0:8:47,98



164
0:8:47,98 --> 0:8:50,31
Well, Randy, the crash
test dummy,


165
0:8:50,31 --> 0:8:52,45
was inside this capsule.


166
0:8:52,45 --> 0:8:54,78
And, well, he lost a leg.


167
0:8:54,78 --> 0:8:58,49
It's possible, actually, that
he would have survived, only


168
0:8:58,49 --> 0:9:1,49
because of the direction
that it hit water.


169
0:9:1,49 --> 0:9:5,583
But he might be in a wheelchair
forever if it was a


170
0:9:5,583 --> 0:9:8,35
live person.


171
0:9:8,35 --> 0:9:10,29
Randy has been a good
friend of ours.


172
0:9:10,29 --> 0:9:12,75
He's been flying for
the last two years.


173
0:9:12,75 --> 0:9:15,15
So every time we have a capsule
or a spaceship, he's


174
0:9:15,15 --> 0:9:16,97
going to be in the
seat, and he's


175
0:9:16,97 --> 0:9:18,65
going to take the beating.


176
0:9:18,65 --> 0:9:22,31
That's why you have a
crash test dummy.


177
0:9:22,31 --> 0:9:26,7
Keeping one person alive, even
only for a 15 minute ride, is


178
0:9:26,7 --> 0:9:27,47
a big challenge.


179
0:9:27,47 --> 0:9:32,66
You need to create a reliable
piece of confined room,


180
0:9:32,66 --> 0:9:37,46
confined space for one person,
where you have a small seat,


181
0:9:37,46 --> 0:9:41,5
where you're comfortable but
also work with all the


182
0:9:41,5 --> 0:9:44,34
acceleration from launching
the rocket but also when


183
0:9:44,34 --> 0:9:46,33
landing on sea.


184
0:9:46,33 --> 0:9:48,24
This is where you're going to
be, and this is where you're


185
0:9:48,24 --> 0:9:51,54
actually going to experience
this incredible ride, where


186
0:9:51,54 --> 0:9:53,1
you're going to feel
the rocket lifting


187
0:9:53,1 --> 0:9:54,83
you away from Earth.


188
0:9:54,83 --> 0:9:57,49
And it's going to be so fast.


189
0:9:57,49 --> 0:9:59,13
And eventually, you're
going to see Earth


190
0:9:59,13 --> 0:10:0,625
turning around out here.


191
0:10:0,625 --> 0:10:5,81
And it's just an amazing
feeling, actually, just to


192
0:10:5,81 --> 0:10:8,92
have those thoughts.


193
0:10:8,92 --> 0:10:12,71
When the US, they launched the
first astronaut, Alan Shepard,


194
0:10:12,71 --> 0:10:15,9
the whole countdown actually
stopped because the engineers


195
0:10:15,9 --> 0:10:17,97
suddenly became scared.


196
0:10:17,97 --> 0:10:21,6
They realized they had
a person inside.


197
0:10:21,6 --> 0:10:25,24
And they weren't really prepared
mentally for that.


198
0:10:25,24 --> 0:10:27,84
So the countdown stopped
until Alan Shepard--


199
0:10:27,84 --> 0:10:30,966
he told them "light
the candle"--


200
0:10:30,966 --> 0:10:32,382
his famous words.


201
0:10:32,382 --> 0:10:35,214



202
0:10:35,214 --> 0:10:36,63
-Lift off.


203
0:10:36,63 --> 0:10:37,102
ALAN SHEPARD: All
right, there.


204
0:10:37,102 --> 0:10:39,932
Lift off, and the clock
has started.

0:10:39,932 --> 0:10:41,93
KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: An
organization like this--


206
0:10:41,93 --> 0:10:45,59
I don't know what's going to
happen when everybody had a


207
0:10:45,59 --> 0:10:49,3
part in it, and they suddenly
understand that this--


208
0:10:49,3 --> 0:10:51,19
what they did--


209
0:10:51,19 --> 0:10:56,33
if it doesn't work, it will
have a fatal outcome.


210
0:10:56,33 --> 0:10:58,21
Or maybe it's not going
to be a problem.


211
0:10:58,21 --> 0:11:1,4
Maybe everybody's just going
to find it exhilarating.


212
0:11:1,4 --> 0:11:9,6



213
0:11:9,6 --> 0:11:11,78
PETER MADSEN: It doesn't take
much courage to climb on board


214
0:11:11,78 --> 0:11:17,8
a rocket and have the hatch
sealed and somebody light it,


215
0:11:17,8 --> 0:11:20,17
because it either works
or it doesn't work.


216
0:11:20,17 --> 0:11:22,25
And if it doesn't work, the
period of time you'd have to


217
0:11:22,25 --> 0:11:24,69
realize that is usually
very short.


218
0:11:24,69 --> 0:11:27,3
But it takes a lot
of courage--


219
0:11:27,3 --> 0:11:29,75
it takes an unimaginable
amount of courage--


220
0:11:29,75 --> 0:11:35,4
to be the ground crew, to be the
commanders on the ground,


221
0:11:35,4 --> 0:11:37,32
to make the decision, let's
launch this thing


222
0:11:37,32 --> 0:11:38,53
and see if it works.


223
0:11:38,53 --> 0:11:41,47
And Kristian is one of the few
people that I've ever met who


224
0:11:41,47 --> 0:11:45,355
is courageous enough
to do such a thing.


225
0:11:45,355 --> 0:11:54,301
-T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7,
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.


226
0:11:54,301 --> 0:11:59,88



227
0:11:59,88 --> 0:12:1,92
KRISTIAN VON BENGTSON: Human
space flight has always had


228
0:12:1,92 --> 0:12:4,63
this holy grail kind of
sphere around it.


229
0:12:4,63 --> 0:12:10,13



230
0:12:10,13 --> 0:12:12,4
It's supposed to be expensive.


231
0:12:12,4 --> 0:12:14,8
It's supposed to be
very complex.


232
0:12:14,8 --> 0:12:18,12
So you just completely just
forget the notion or the idea


233
0:12:18,12 --> 0:12:21,22
let's try and build our
own space rocket.


234
0:12:21,22 --> 0:12:22,91
People just don't want
to touch it.


235
0:12:22,91 --> 0:12:27,27
But I hope we can inspire people
that space rocket, you


236
0:12:27,27 --> 0:12:28,54
can actually build
it yourself.


237
0:12:28,54 --> 0:12:38,32



238
0:12:38,32 --> 0:12:41,8
If there should be some kind
of legacy from what we are


239
0:12:41,8 --> 0:12:45,53
doing here on this DIY project,
that should be


240
0:12:45,53 --> 0:12:48,99
showing the world that human
space flight can actually be


241
0:12:48,99 --> 0:12:52,37
done on a completely different
scale, on a completely


242
0:12:52,37 --> 0:12:55,86
different level, with very
simple technology.


243
0:12:55,86 --> 0:12:57,28
You're welcome to come
and join us.


244
0:12:57,28 --> 0:13:0,8
You're also welcome to come here
with a measuring tape and


245
0:13:0,8 --> 0:13:2,4
your camera.


246
0:13:2,4 --> 0:13:5,48
Take all the pictures or
download all of the images and


247
0:13:5,48 --> 0:13:8,32
sketches from our blog and just,
you know, copy the work


248
0:13:8,32 --> 0:13:10,53
or go from there from
what we're doing.


249
0:13:10,53 --> 0:13:13,79
Basically, everybody can do this
if they want to do it.
