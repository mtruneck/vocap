###9 SHANE SMITH: We're going right now to meet
###11 an imam, or a cleric--
###13 so a religious guy, the guys who run this country.
###18 And he's apparently kind of a hip imam.
###19 He runs a coffee shop now.
###21 He's one of the guys who rebuilt Iranian cinema after
###24 the revolution.
###25 And so we're going to go hear his stories about that and
###29 about being one of the first religious
###31 leaders involved in film.
###33 
###36 Salaam, Ali.
###38 [SPEAKING FARSI]
###39 
###90 -Where are you from?
###92 -Iran.
###93 -Iran, yeah.
###95 -I'm sorry.
###97 SHANE SMITH: In fact, "The Snowman" is a film that was
###99 banned because it featured cross-dressing.
###101 It's a story about a guy that wants to move to America.
###103 So he dresses like a woman so he can marry an American man
###106 and get a visa.
###107 It's kind of like "Tootsie" meets "Monty Python."
###110 And it was banned and shut down.
###111 And no one could see it until the Ayatollah Khomeini saw it,
###115 laughed, and said hey, this is a great movie.
###116 I thought it was funny, it's fine.
###118 So they released it and it became the number one box
###120 office success in Iranian history.
###122 And this is the cleric that produced it.
###125 Thank you very much.
###126 Merci.
###126 MOHHAMAD-ALI ZAM: Thank you.
###126 SHANE SMITH: I guess Iranian film industry must be doing
###129 really well.
###129 Because when we were there, there were about 10 film sets
###132 shooting simultaneously.
###134 In fact, when we left the tea house, there was a film
###137 shooting in the park right across the way.
###139 They're about to crash that bike into that pond.
###142 [SPEAKING FARSI]
###143 
###157 SHANE SMITH: Good work.
###159 So finally, after going to about 20 film sets, meeting
###162 all the producers and all the directors and all the actors,
###165 it was time for the big event of the year.
###167 It was time for the awards ceremony at the Film Festival.
###171 Now, I've been asked the night before to go accept the award
###174 for Guy Maddin who was going to win Best Experimental
###177 Documentary Film for his movie, "My Winnipeg."
###180 Now, I'm Canadian.
###181 Guy's Canadian.
###182 We'd interviewed him for BBS.
###184 So I said sure, I'll go up and say on behalf of Guy Maddin,
###187 thank you very much.
###188 And they said no, no, no.
###189 And I said OK, I'll say Guy says thanks.
###191 And they said, just accept the award.
###193 So I twig on to the fact that they want to seem
###195 cosmopolitan.
###196 So I take the bait and say great, I'll do it.
###198 So we're learning Farsi to accept the award.
###201 And we're going to be filmed by three national television
###204 stations, too.
###206 So we're going to be fraudulent celebrities.
###209 
###212 So the ceremony finally starts.
###214 There's all kinds of filmmakers there.
###215 There's government officials.
###217 There's the Mayor of Tehran.
###218 And they're giving out the awards, until finally Best
###221 Documentary Film comes up.
###222 [SPEAKING FARSI]
###223 
###235 Thank you so much, Mr. Maddin, for your
###237 participation in this festival.
###239 And congratulations.
###239 [SPEAKING FARSI]
###241 
###254 SHANE SMITH: Thank you for the festival and
###256 the people of Tehran.
###257 [SPEAKING FARSI]
###258 
###268 So there's a standing ovation.
###269 People are freaking out.
###271 The Mayor of Tehran comes up and hugs me.
###274 Newspapers and TV are going "Western director loves Iran."
###277 I was sitting there laughing my head off.
###279 It wasn't my award.
###281 Sorry, Guy.
###282 Great film though.
###283 That was our last night in Tehran.
###284 
###288 Pretty much all the stereotypes that we had seen
###290 in Western media before going to Iran were dispelled when we
###294 went there.
###294 We met empowered women.
###295 We met progressive clerics.
###297 We met beautiful actresses.
###298 We met fantastic filmmakers.
###300 And these fantastic filmmakers have been showing another side
###303 of Iran, a side of Iran that we're now
###305 seeing with the dissent.
###308 So what we've seen for the past 20 years in Iranian
###310 cinema, what we saw when we were in Tehran, and what the
###313 world saw during their last elections shows that what the
###316 Iranian people think and what the actual government does are
###320 completely different.
###322 And that hopefully we might be at the cusp of a new Iranian
###326 revolution.
###327
