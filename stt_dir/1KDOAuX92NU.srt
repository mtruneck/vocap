UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, I`m Calen Windorf

3
0:0:10,6 --> 0:0:20,26
CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: That Calen, he`s a
real card.


4
0:0:20,26 --> 0:0:24,6
All right, first up today -- an issue that`s
getting a lot of attention in Washington -- immigration


5
0:0:24,6 --> 0:0:29,359
reform. President Obama talked about it yesterday.
He says it`s a top priority for this second


6
0:0:29,359 --> 0:0:34,55
term, and he thinks the time is right to overhaul
the current immigration system. Undocumented


7
0:0:34,55 --> 0:0:37,89
immigrants, like these next two students would
probably want to see that.

0:0:38,42 --> 0:0:41,79
ROLANDO ZENTENO, ARMSTRONG UNIVERSITY FRESHMAN:
I identify myself with the American culture,


10
0:0:41,79 --> 0:0:43,71
but sometimes the American society is like
no, you are not part of us.


11
0:0:43,71 --> 0:0:46,45
JESUS ARROYO, ARMSTRONG UNIVERSITY SENIOR:
It`s amazing to see that, you know, they are


12
0:0:46,45 --> 0:0:49,44
willing to help us now, because all my life,
you know, I`ve been here, not knowing what`s


13
0:0:49,44 --> 0:0:52,19
going to be my future, not knowing where I`m
going to go.


14
0:0:52,19 --> 0:0:53,129
(END VIDEO CLIP)


15
0:0:53,129 --> 0:0:57,62
AZUZ: You may remember that a group of U.S.
Senators announced an immigration reform plan


16
0:0:57,62 --> 0:1:2,16
earlier this week. It would include a path
for undocumented immigrants, people who were


17
0:1:2,16 --> 0:1:7,49
in the country illegally, to become citizens.
President Obama agrees with that idea, but


18
0:1:7,49 --> 0:1:8,679
some folks think it`s a bad one.


19
0:1:8,679 --> 0:1:9,139
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


20
0:1:9,139 --> 0:1:12,959
REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN, (R ), TENNESSEE: Why
don`t we talk about a pathway to legality?


21
0:1:12,959 --> 0:1:19,99
Why don`t we talk about a pathway to green
card? Why don`t we talk about some other things


22
0:1:19,99 --> 0:1:25,659
rather then going straight to pathway to citizenship.
You know, is this fair to those that have


23
0:1:25,659 --> 0:1:30,899
been in the queue for a long, long time, going
through the legal process, trying to get into


24
0:1:30,899 --> 0:1:31,7
this country?


25
0:1:31,7 --> 0:1:32,279
(END VIDEO CLIP)


26
0:1:32,279 --> 0:1:36,29
AZUZ: So, a lot of talk about immigration
reform. What are your thoughts on this issue?


27
0:1:36,29 --> 0:1:40,369
Head to our blog at cnnstudentnews.com, or,
if you are on Facebook, you can talk to us


28
0:1:40,369 --> 0:1:44,469
there at Facebook.com/ cnnstudentnews.


29
0:1:44,469 --> 0:1:49,189
Interesting weather fact -- the U.S. has more
tornadoes than any other country on the planet,


30
0:1:49,189 --> 0:1:54,209
about a 1000 of them are reported every year.
Most of those show up during spring and early


31
0:1:54,209 --> 0:1:58,989
summer, but some states were dealing with
tornado watches this week. We talked with


32
0:1:58,989 --> 0:2:3,88
chief CNN meteorologist Chad Myers, and the
first question we asked is, why don`t we see


33
0:2:3,88 --> 0:2:5,489
more tornadoes in the winter?


34
0:2:5,489 --> 0:2:5,999
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


35
0:2:5,999 --> 0:2:9,239
CHAD MYERS, CHIEF METEOROLOGIST: We do see
tornadoes in the winter. It`s a little bit


36
0:2:9,239 --> 0:2:13,89
odd, but we don`t think about them, we get
them in the overnight, late night hours, in


37
0:2:13,89 --> 0:2:18,78
the southern part of the United States, follow
the jet stream. In the winter, the jet is


38
0:2:18,78 --> 0:2:23,59
over Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Florida.
That`s where the severe weather is. Then it


39
0:2:23,59 --> 0:2:28,719
moves north, in March, April and May, that`s
tornado alley -- Oklahoma, Texas, all the


40
0:2:28,719 --> 0:2:32,25
way up to Illinois, Indiana, Ohio. And then
by the summer, it`s all the way to Edmonton.


41
0:2:32,25 --> 0:2:36,319
It`s in the Canada, because that`s where the
jet stream is, the jet stream is the energy,


42
0:2:36,319 --> 0:2:41,79
that`s where the severe weather always is.


43
0:2:41,79 --> 0:2:44,76
First thing you need to know is that when
these storms that happen in the dark, those


44
0:2:44,76 --> 0:2:49,6
are the most dangerous. You`re sleeping, you`re
probably not watching TV, you don`t have radio


45
0:2:49,6 --> 0:2:52,7
on, all of the sudden those are the storms
that can really hurt you. They are not going


46
0:2:52,7 --> 0:2:57,439
to be big, maybe, you know, F1s or 2, small
tornadoes. But if it hits your house, it`s


47
0:2:57,439 --> 0:3:1,76
a big deal, isn`t it? That thing where you
can do to protect yourself is that there`s


48
0:3:1,76 --> 0:3:7,45
an iPhone, iPad iTouch app, you keep that,
it will go off, it will alarm you when a tornado


49
0:3:7,45 --> 0:3:10,629
was happening, or just going to know where
the radio. That`s the old standby.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s first "Shoutout"
goes out to Mrs. Hill`s English and language


53
0:3:16,189 --> 0:3:20,98
arts students at Elkton Middle School in Elkton,
Maryland.


54
0:3:20,98 --> 0:3:27,319
Which of these countries share the border
with Syria? Here we go, is it Iran, Lebanon,


55
0:3:27,319 --> 0:3:38,18
Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan? You`ve got three
seconds, go!


56
0:3:38,18 --> 0:3:43,409
Lebanon is the only one of these countries
that border Syria. That`s your answer and


57
0:3:43,409 --> 0:3:45,79
that`s your "Shoutout."


58
0:3:45,79 --> 0:3:46,749
(END VIDEO CLIP)


59
0:3:46,749 --> 0:3:52,349
AZUZ: In the nearly two years since Syria`s
civil war started, more than 150,000 people


60
0:3:52,349 --> 0:3:56,48
have crossed that border, going to Lebanon
to escape the fighting that has killed more


61
0:3:56,48 --> 0:3:57,779
than 60,000 people.


62
0:3:57,779 --> 0:4:2,579
When you`re seeing news about Syria, you hear
about the government forces, about the rebels.


63
0:4:2,579 --> 0:4:7,9
What about people your age? Teens who went
from living their lives to living in the middle


64
0:4:7,9 --> 0:4:12,389
of a war? Kayana (ph) is 14. She lives in
Lebanon now. She wrote something for a school


65
0:4:12,389 --> 0:4:17,509
project about how the war has changed her
life. This is her story and her words.


66
0:4:17,509 --> 0:4:18,69
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


67
0:4:18,69 --> 0:4:22,36
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My name is Kayana (ph),
and I`m 14 years old, and I`m from Aleppo,


68
0:4:22,36 --> 0:4:27,12
Syria. I used to think everything was perfect,
like the fairy tales, and now like I don`t


69
0:4:27,12 --> 0:4:30,49
know any more. I don`t know how anything is,
I don`t know how anything is going to turn


70
0:4:30,49 --> 0:4:31,38
out to be.


71
0:4:31,38 --> 0:4:37,449
I miss the most how we would be like so care
free, you know. We would love all the time,


72
0:4:37,449 --> 0:4:42,9
and like we were also happy, every one like
the old and the young, everyone was like really


73
0:4:42,9 --> 0:4:47,199
happy. Like my school, my friends -- everything.
I always dream that we are in school right


74
0:4:47,199 --> 0:4:52,3
now, and for me, that`s actually nightmare,
because I want it so bad, but not like I know


75
0:4:52,3 --> 0:4:54,87
it might not happen again.


76
0:4:54,87 --> 0:4:59,419
The bombing that happened close to my house
was in the morning, and my sister was at basketball


77
0:4:59,419 --> 0:5:4,449
practice at school, and they could see like
a lot of smoke and like bits of bodies were


78
0:5:4,449 --> 0:5:9,53
flying everywhere. And so when I woke up,
my mom was really scared because my sister


79
0:5:9,53 --> 0:5:14,34
was there. But then she told me that everything
was OK. And when I tried looking at the TV,


80
0:5:14,34 --> 0:5:18,919
she switched the channels. But I was able
to see like everything -- like the dead bodies


81
0:5:18,919 --> 0:5:19,68
and everyone.


82
0:5:19,68 --> 0:5:24,4
Where I`ve been through changed me a lot,
because it changed me in two ways. For example,


83
0:5:24,4 --> 0:5:28,979
when I used to complain about really silly
things, I realize that there is like a much


84
0:5:28,979 --> 0:5:33,419
bigger world down there where people die and
like people are killed. It also changed me


85
0:5:33,419 --> 0:5:37,919
in another way, because I always -- like I`m
always angry right now at everyone, and like


86
0:5:37,919 --> 0:5:41,31
I`m not like happy the way I used to be.


87
0:5:41,31 --> 0:5:47,18
What makes me angry is how people are so selfish,
and they are killing each other, like without


88
0:5:47,18 --> 0:5:52,75
considering how people are dying, and like
-- the -- like the situation they`re putting


89
0:5:52,75 --> 0:5:57,15
their parents into (and their family. Now,
everyone is crying everyday, and there is


90
0:5:57,15 --> 0:6:1,93
no electricity, there is no food. How people
are like struggling just to survive now.


91
0:6:1,93 --> 0:6:7,759
I don`t blame anyone specific, but I blame
everyone that`s just holding a gun right now.


92
0:6:7,759 --> 0:6:11,86
Like for whatever reason they think they are
doing it.


93
0:6:11,86 --> 0:6:16,59
The day my family decided to come to Lebanon,
it was really hard for me. In the beginning,


94
0:6:16,59 --> 0:6:17,84
it was all a blur -


95
0:6:17,84 --> 0:6:22,56
I always try to hope and I look at other people
how they have no food, no home, and I thank


96
0:6:22,56 --> 0:6:24,31
God for what I have.


97
0:6:24,31 --> 0:6:29,99
My mom goes back and forth to help the refugees
and she like donates a lot of food and our


98
0:6:29,99 --> 0:6:34,83
old toys, and our old clothes. And like the
reason I want to go back, basically, is because


99
0:6:34,83 --> 0:6:38,699
I want to make a difference. I want to help
these people and go with my mom and like -- try


100
0:6:38,699 --> 0:6:41,449
to like at least make someone happy in there.


101
0:6:41,449 --> 0:6:47,789
Yeah, I`m scared for like, for more to happen,
for more people to die. And I`m scared that


102
0:6:47,789 --> 0:6:52,789
the hope I have right now to go back, like
at the end will all be erased, and then like


103
0:6:52,789 --> 0:6:55,199
I won`t really have anything left to look
forward to.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s time for a "Shoutout
Extra Credit." Who was the winning coach in


107
0:7:1,629 --> 0:7:8,5
the first Super Bowl? You know what to do.
Was it John Madden, Knute Rockne, Mike Ditka


108
0:7:8,5 --> 0:7:15,6
or Vince Lombardi? Put another three seconds
on the clock and go!


109
0:7:15,6 --> 0:7:22,55
Lombardi`s Green Bay Packers won the first
two Super Bowls, and the Super Bowl trophy


110
0:7:22,55 --> 0:7:28,37
was later renamed the Lombardi trophy. That`s
your answer and that`s your "Shoutout Extra


111
0:7:28,37 --> 0:7:28,75
Credit."

113
0:7:31,49 --> 0:7:35,919
AZUZ: Anthony is rooting for the Baltimore
Ravens in the upcoming Super Bowl, because


114
0:7:35,919 --> 0:7:41,68
he wants Ray Lewis, a linebacker on the team,
to have a Super Bowl win in his last season.


115
0:7:41,68 --> 0:7:46,439
Riggy is pulling for the San Francisco 49ers,
saying with Kaepernick and Gore running against


116
0:7:46,439 --> 0:7:52,5
them, the Ravens will have too much to handle.
But like Nick said, no matter what, "Harbaugh


117
0:7:52,5 --> 0:7:57,65
is going to win." Jim and John Harbaugh are
the coaches of the two teams. They are brothers,


118
0:7:57,65 --> 0:8:4,389
and they`ll be battling each other in Super
Bowl XLVII, which are Roman numerals for 47.


119
0:8:4,389 --> 0:8:9,169
A lot of folks know about that, not a lot
of folks know this: their parents will be


120
0:8:9,169 --> 0:8:13,439
at the game. Who they root for? They don`t
know. They are just worried it`s going to


121
0:8:13,439 --> 0:8:15,819
be heart-wrenching for whoever loses.


122
0:8:15,819 --> 0:8:22,259
Retiring Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis has played
for 17 years. His first sack, against Indianapolis


123
0:8:22,259 --> 0:8:28,24
Colts quarterback Jim Harbaugh, who is now
coaching the 49ers. In previous games between


124
0:8:28,24 --> 0:8:34,21
these two teams, the Ravens have won three,
the 49ers, one. Both teams have perfect Super


125
0:8:34,21 --> 0:8:39,78
Bowl records. The 49ers have won five of five,
the Ravens one of one. So it`s somebody`s


126
0:8:39,78 --> 0:8:45,29
perfect Super Bowl record is going to be broken,
unless Jackie Harbaugh, the two coaches` mother,


127
0:8:45,29 --> 0:8:49,83
gets her wish, that it will end in a tie.


128
0:8:49,83 --> 0:8:56,6
Well, Andrew Gray had a problem. Whenever
he left his parrot alone, the bird would go


129
0:8:56,6 --> 0:9:2,86
nuts. The solution -- the bird buggy. Since
Pepper piped up anytime Andrew left the room,


130
0:9:2,86 --> 0:9:7,2
he figured he needed to give the parrot a
way to follow him around. So he built this,


131
0:9:7,2 --> 0:9:11,66
posted it on Youtube, and now Pepper can use
his beak to drive himself around instead of


132
0:9:11,66 --> 0:9:17,0
driving Andrew crazy. Best of all, Andrew
can walk out of a room now, and he doesn`t


133
0:9:17,0 --> 0:9:20,6
have to worry about ruffling any feathers.
It`s a good thing he thought of that solution,


134
0:9:20,6 --> 0:9:24,6
otherwise the noisy bird might have been given
his squawking papers. And since the story


135
0:9:24,6 --> 0:9:28,56
has gone viral, you can probably expect some
parrot-ies. Really, there is no talon what


136
0:9:28,56 --> 0:9:32,59
people might come up with, assuming they have
the drive. It`s time for us to fly, CNN STUDENT


137
0:9:32,59 --> 0:11:32,59
NEWS, we`ll be beak tomorrow, we`ll see you
then.
