###56 RAY LATYPOV: My brother, Nurulla.
###58 
###112 JIM DIMASCIO: I came aboard serving as our Chief Operating
###114 Officer in charge of marketing, and Ray serves as
###117 our CEO, and Nurulla serves as our Chief Technology Officer.
###122 Ray and Nurulla, they invented Virtusphere for the immersive
###126 and virtual reality experience.
###128 The Virtusphere is a new, innovative technology that
###131 really is a locomotion simulator.
###133 And just to define locomotion, it doesn't have anything to do
###136 with trains, but the movement of people.
###138 The ability of being able to get inside and walk or run in
###141 a north, east, south, or west direction.
###143 It's a 10-foot sphere in its diameter, and sits on a round
###147 base of 11 sections of steel.
###150 So it's affectionately nicknamed the
###152 hamster ball for humans.
###153 Virtusphere could really bring a brand new experience.
###156 And again, not to keep going back, but also to get some
###160 exercise, so that you're not just sitting at your PC in a
###164 chair for extended periods of time, whether it be one hour
###167 or four hours.
###169 But once you're inside Virtusphere, you're really
###171 going to get an interactive experience with exercise.
###174 And that's a win-win in today's modern economy.
###176 
###181 It's actually been a very effective start, as we are a
###185 true start-up in the new
###186 locomotion simulation business.
###188 We're very excited to have you here today, and we're very
###191 much looking forward to showing you our technology.
###194 And now we're approaching the office of Virtusphere, And
###198 very excited to get everybody's impression of our
###201 Virtusphere technology.
###203 This is Virtusphere.
###205 This is how it works.
###206 A person can get inside, and can start walking.
###210 
###214 And change directions, which is much different than a
###217 conventional treadmill.
###218 You can go in any direction, and with a little practice,
###228 you can jog.
###230 And that's the physics of Virtusphere, and that's just
###232 the beginning.
###233 A person can get exercise, as you can even tell.
###236 After a person gets out of Virtusphere, you know you've
###239 gotten a little bit of a work out.
###241 
###244 But that's just the physics of Virtusphere, and how you can
###246 walk or right.
###247 Now what we're going to show you is the technology part,
###249 and this is the real fun part.
###251 Hey, Ray.
###252 Hey, Nurulla.
###254 
###261 JIM DIMASCIO: Sounds good.
###262 
###296 RAY LATYPOV: Here's our-- to go inside.
###298 
###303 Should we close that?
###305 
###309 
###360 JIM DIMASCIO: Today, most people play the game via their
###363 couch, their PC monitor, their desk chair.
###365 But with Virtusphere, you truly get immersed into your
###368 virtual reality experience.
