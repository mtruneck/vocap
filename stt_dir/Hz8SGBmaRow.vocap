###10 Un-shitting-believable.
###40 I'm Dr Khan's replacement. Dr Gill.
###45 You can call me Kester.
###49 - Is it Rachel? - Rae.
###54 I told Dr Khan to ask you to start keeping a diary.
###57 But you can't read it because Dr Khan...
###60 I don't want to read it.
###62 It's private. It's for you.
###70 Are you always this quiet?
###76 You know, there's a theory
###79 that you can discern the majority of a person's characteristics
###82 in the first five seconds of meeting them.
###85 What do your instincts say about me?
###87 My instincts say that a bird took a dump on your head.
###93 So...
###95 You survived the first week still in one piece, I see.
###100 What have we been up to?
###101 Look, with Dr Khan, we would just talk...
###104 I'm not Dr Khan.
###109 So...
###111 what have we been up to this week?
###118 Not much.
###122 Big lie. This week has, in fact, been pretty momentous.
###128 Wednesday, 10th July, 1996.
###134 Freedom.
###137 Dear Diary, I'm 16, I weigh 16.5 stone
###141 and I live in Lincolnshire.
###143 My interests include music, vegging out and finding a fit boy...
###149 Oh, scratch that, any boy, to quench my ever-growing horn.
###154 Unfortunately, I already have a lover that makes me look pregnant.
###159 Food.
###160 But, well, there is a difference between snacking and bingeing.
###164 And I don't binge any more.
###168 And if anyone ever finds this diary
###170 and reads it and comes to the conclusion that I'm crazy...
###179 they'd be spot on.
###180 <font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font> <font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>
###219 Go away. I'm not speaking to you.
###221 Why not?
###222 You're abandoning me. You're leaving me here with all the mentals.
###227 I'll be back for my sessions all the time.
###229 You won't be back.
###231 You'll be off going to loads of parties,
###233 boy parties.
###235 Tix, we both know that there are zero cool people in Lincolnshire.
###242 Tissue, please, Skinny.
###257 Did you get a new toothbrush?
###261 I'm gonna miss you.
###264 'Poor, lovely, messed-up Tixy.'
###268 Here.
###276 Go.
###289 Hi, Rae.
###291 Hi.
###293 'Dr Nick Kassar,
###295 'expert moistener of lady gardens.
###298 'I wanna eat his face!'
###303 It's, erm... It's good for the skin.
###305 Yeah, I know, yeah. I drink two litres a day.
###307 Problem is, it makes you go to the loo every half hour.
###315 I'm getting picked up in 20 minutes.
###316 What a shame.
###318 Why is that?
###319 Because I never got a chance to do a sex on you.
###324 Rae.
###325 Yeah.
###326 Don't get up to any mischief.
###331 Well, don't go changing!
###334 You keep drinking that water!
###336 'Oh, God. Why do I always say such twattish things?'
###342 Four months locked away.
###345 Four months convincing people
###346 my finger is no longer on the self-destruct button.
###351 Finally, I was leaving.
###356 Finally, I was free.
###380 I'm not ready.
###381 Where are you? Outside.
###384 I'm freaking out.
###386 I'm having a freak-out.
###388 Just count to ten.
###389 I'm not strong enough to make it on my own.
###391 You're not on your own. You've got your mum and all your friends.
###394 My mum's a nightmare, and I haven't got any friends.
###397 You're my friend.
###400 The pips are going.
###402 What if something really bad happens?
###404 What if I have a proper freak-out, what then?
###406 Just count to ten.
###407 Yeah, but...
###421 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
###446 I'm sorry I was late. It's only been ten minutes.
###449 40 minutes.
###450 Give over with your 40 minutes.
###451 You talk more random than duck shite sometimes.
###459 D'you want one?
###460 When have I ever smoked?
###461 You might have started.
###470 Might have some Blue Ribands in the glove box.
###482 No, no. I can't, love. No, I'm on the alphabet diet.
###485 The what?
###487 Each week, you only eat food beginning with a certain letter.
###489 Makes you rotate all your food types. This week it's W.
###494 So, you've nearly done the entire alphabet?
###496 No. I started on S, cos I bought a load of Scotch eggs on the cheap.
###499 I've lost six pounds, though.
###502 That's, what, just over a month,
###504 month and a bit.
###506 Have Blue Ribands got wafer in it?
###508 Wafer begins with a W.
###556 Oh, no.
###560 Rae?
###561 Who's that?
###563 Chloe.
###564 Rae! Oh, my God!
###565 Chloe? Blood and stomach pills, she's blossomed.
###568 Look at the chest.
###577 Please don't embarrass me.
###579 Oh, get over yourself.
###581 And don't be long. We're in a rush.
###584 Oh, my God! Come here!
###586 Why didn't you tell me you were back? How was France?
###589 France?
###592 Yeah, it was great. It was really nice.
###596 I can't believe you've been gone three months.
###597 Four months.
###600 - Yeah, well... - Rae!
###602 I'm glad you're back, anyway...
###604 Thanks.
###609 I should go.
###611 Oh, no, no, no. Listen, listen...
###613 Come to the pub tonight with the gang.
###616 I've started hanging round with the sixth formers from Wellesley Park.
###619 The guys are fit as, right?
###623 - And they're all single. - Chop!
###625 So, please come, sweets.
###627 Please!
###634 'Yes, please...'
###639 Yeah?
###640 I mean, um, yeah...
###642 I'm a bit busy, but it would be cool to hang out with you.
###648 In France, all I did was hang. Definitely.
###650 I'd probably get withdrawal symptoms if I stopped hanging.
###653 Yeah.
###655 Rae!
###666 Well, I'll see you later, then.
###669 Bye.
###672 France?!
###674 Well, I had to say something. You told me not to tell anyone.
###677 France?!
###678 Why didn't you just say I had glandular fever or summat?
###688 'Welcome to the house of pain.
###691 'Barely enough room for one person,
###693 'let alone me and her.
###695 'I'm not even in and I wanna get out.'
###700 Come on, Rachel. I've got something to show you.
###706 What?
###720 Rae, this is Karim.
###723 My lover.
###724 Isn't he something?
###730 Ohhh! Say hello! Say hello, say hello.
###734 Pleased to meet you.
###736 Why were you in the boot?
###738 Oh... Well, he can't speak much English.
###741 He speaks Arabic and French.
###743 That's what they speak in Tunisia.
###746 Er... Help...
###748 Right, who'd like a sticky waffle?
###752 Why was he in the chuffing boot?
###755 Look... Right, look. He hasn't done anything wrong,
###759 but there are people looking for him.
###761 What people? Immigration.
###762 He's not allowed to be here. Not just yet. Not just for now.
###766 He, er...
###767 He ran away from this holding place, and...
###770 we fell in love.
###773 Now, no-one can know about this.
###775 Not just for now. Is that OK, Rachel?
###779 Oh, Karim!
###780 Put me down, you bloody beast!
###782 Oh!
###786 There is a difference between snacking and bingeing.
###789 And I don't binge any more.
###808 Ever feel like you're returning to the scene of a crime?
###846 Oh, Damon. I love you, but I've gotta get out of this house
###850 and meet some real boys.
###858 Right, look.
###860 Before you meet everyone, just try and be cool, yeah?
###863 I could try and get you in with them, but they're a pretty exclusive bunch,
###867 so... just don't be upset if it doesn't happen.
###870 OK? Yeah.
###872 You ready? Yeah.
###873 Come on.
###874 Izzy.
###876 'Being in a pub is weird
###878 'when eight hours earlier you were in a mental ward.
###881 'I felt like a criminal, like a renegade,
###885 'like it was so obvious I wasn't meant to be there.'
###889 Sorry, lover!
###890 'I felt alive.'
###892 Everyone, this is Rae.
###894 You all right?
###895 Hiya! All right?
###896 Do you want a drink? Cos Chop can get served.
###898 Er, no, it's all right. I don't drink.
###899 Really?
###901 Yeah.
###902 Where's Archie?
###904 Somewhere. He said he was coming, so...
###913 What are you doing, you benny? You trying to get us kicked out?
###917 Here y'are. Make yourself useful and take a picture
###920 of the biggest pythons in sports entertainment.
###923 What, these ones? Them ones or them ones?
###927 Here y'are. Let me have a go.
###929 Archie, get up here!
###930 Archie, get up here!
###937 Cheers.
###938 Go on, Arch!
###940 Go on! Go on!
###942 Now, this is a little hit that came out a few months back.
###946 ♪ Well, I tried to tell you so
###949 ♪ But I guess you didn't know
###951 ♪ As the sad story goes
###953 ♪ Baby, now I've got to flow
###957 ♪ Cos I knew it from the start
###959 ♪ Baby, when you broke my heart
###961 ♪ That I had to come again and show you that I'm real
###967 ♪ You lied to me
###969 ♪ All those times I said that I loved you
###972 ♪ You lied to me
###974 ♪ And I tried, yes, I tried
###977 ♪ Return of the Mack... ♪
###979 'Two words.
###980 'Gushington Central.
###987 'So, this is what I've worked out so far about the gang.
###989 'There's Chloe,
###991 'who's, like, my oldest friend.
###993 'We kind of grew apart over the last year.
###996 'I guess I kind of had my own stuff going on.
###999 'Like wondering why my best friend was growing apart from me.
###1003 'Like wondering why I was having a secret mental breakdown.
###1008 'But whatever. It's complicated, ' I guess.
###1012 There's no topping on this.
###1013 There's no topping on this. You've opened the box upside down, you div.
###1018 'Then there's Izzy.
###1019 'She's so cute. I've only known her for two hours, but I can't imagine
###1024 'she'd have a negative thought about...anything.'
###1027 You two are so like a married couple sometimes.
###1030 Uh, gross! It'd be like marrying me sister.
###1032 Yeah! So gross!
###1034 'There's three boys.
###1037 'Chop. Rating - slice.
###1041 'He doesn't even go to school.
###1043 'Chloe says he works down at some garage, fixing cars or summat.'
###1046 I don't care what you say, Jennifer Aniston is fitter than Pammy.
###1051 There's only one woman that's fitter than both.
###1053 Bollocks. Who?
###1055 Your mum!
###1059 No...
###1060 'And Finn's a bit of a grumpy sod.
###1063 'He's such an epic slice,
###1065 'but he massively knows it.'
###1068 Argh!
###1073 'And finally...
###1076 '..Archie. Ultimate slice.
###1080 'Half geek, half rock god.
###1082 'So hot, he'd make a priest kick a hole in a stained-glass window.
###1085 'I wanna do 14,000 romances on him.'
###1131 'I couldn't believe it.
###1134 'There were cool people in Lincolnshire.
###1137 'This was it.
###1139 'This was my chance.'
###1145 Oh, everyone. What?
###1147 Announcement, right? Party at mine on Saturday
###1150 to celebrate Izzy's birthday.
###1154 'And all I had to do was just...'
###1159 Here y'are, Chloe's mate!
###1160 Take a picture!
###1166 It's Rae.
###1168 May, take a picture of us, will you?
###1178 Chop, your guns nearly don't fit in that picture!
###1205 I've decided.
###1207 There are three ways Archie is gonna go out with me.
###1211 One - if he's secretly got a thing for big women,
###1214 like Lenny Henry has for Dawn French.
###1217 Two - apocalyptic catastrophe
###1219 takes out all of the women on the Earth,
###1222 and therefore my humps become a precious commodity.
###1225 Three - I feed him biscuits until he's fat too.
###1235 If this goes in the bin, Archie will definitely sleep with me.
###1270 I had to see you.
###1272 What are you doing here?
###1276 Let's not talk.
###1292 Mmm. Kiss my neck, Archie.
###1295 Please, for me.
###1296 What?
###1297 Please, I beg you.
###1298 Why are you talking like that?
###1301 Please.
###1303 Oh, Karim! Oh! Oh! Karim! Karim! Oh!
###1307 Oh! Oh! Karim! Karim!
###1310 Oh, my God!
###1312 I...can't... believe it!
###1327 What?
###1328 Do you have any idea what time it is?
###1332 It's quarter to five.
###1333 It's quarter to five.
###1335 And I'm awake!
###1338 What do you want? A chufty badge and a round of applause?
###1341 I want to go to sleep knowing that I'm not gonna be woken up
###1345 by the sound of you getting your bones jumped.
###1349 I beg your pardon?!
###1350 Just stop having sex at top volume, yeah?
###1353 I didn't know we were being loud.
###1355 There's people in Peterborough that think the world's coming to an end.
###1358 Oh, come on, Rachel. You talk more random than duck shite sometimes.
###1362 Will you just stop saying that?
###1363 It's just stupid.
###1366 You watch your tone with me, young lady.
###1370 You remember who you're talking to.
###1372 D'you know what?
###1374 'And then I said it.
###1376 'The worst thing I've ever said to my mum.
###1379 'And, as I'm feeling mega guilty anyway,
###1381 'we might as well do the top three.'
###1385 Mum, why's your bum bigger than all the other mums' bums?
###1390 Rachel... Earl!
###1393 Come on.
###1397 I wanted a Kylie one.
###1398 Well, maybe I couldn't afford a Kylie one.
###1401 Maybe if you hadn't made Dad leave, we'd be able to get nice things.
###1405 Rachel... Earl!
###1409 All right!
###1414 It's no wonder I went mental, is it?
###1416 When I've got the biggest screw-up
###1419 in the history of screw-ups for a parent.
###1424 Go on. Say it.
###1428 "Rachel Earl!"
###1446 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
###1456 Thursday, the 11th of July, 1996.
###1461 No-one's called.
###1465 I loved Thursdays in the hospital.
###1467 In the mornings,
###1469 me and Tix would catch up on the charts
###1471 and have toast.
###1472 And in the afternoon, we'd have group and then go out to the lake
###1475 with Danny Two Hats and play Ten Questions.
###1479 But now, there's a new gang, I suppose.
###1483 But why haven't they called?
###1487 Have I fucked it up already?
###1509 Rae?
###1513 What are you doing here?
###1514 I was just passing.
###1515 I thought I'd nip in.
###1517 I would have rang to say we were all coming down, but...
###1521 it was kind of a spontaneous thing.
###1523 You know how it is.
###1526 Archie, put summat decent on the jukebox, will you?
###1530 'Music. My turf.
###1533 'Go big or go home.'
###1536 I'll do it.
###1536 No, I want Archie to do it.
###1538 He knows his music.
###1539 I know my music.
###1541 Look, May... Rae.
###1542 As in Raymond? As in Rachel.
###1544 Whatever. Rae, it's my 20p, and I want Archie to do it, all right?
###1548 If you don't like what I put on, I'll give you your 20p back.
###1561 It was time to drop the big guns.
###1565 And I hereby present my case for gang membership.
###1568 Spin on that, Finn.
###1576 Tune!
###1579 Nice one!
###1580 Yeah, it's not bad... for mainstream.
###1583 I don't think we've been introduced properly. I'm Archie.
###1588 Hi, Archie.
###1589 'I'd shag him until there was nothing left.
###1592 'Just a pair of glasses and a damp patch.'
###1597 Rae, you're still coming to my party on Saturday, right?
###1600 Am I invited?
###1601 Of course you are! Silly moo!
###1605 Tell everyone!
###1607 All right.
###1609 Right, listen. As you all know,
###1611 I am proper excited about moving into my new house,
###1615 so I am delighted to say that my party on Saturday night
###1619 will be my first ever...
###1621 pool party.
###1622 Whoo!
###1624 Pool party? Get in there!
###1630 Are you kidding me?!
###1632 Who wants a snakebite? Yeah, I do.
###1636 Go on, you can do it!
###1638 You can do it!
###1641 Yes!
###1646 'I am...'
###1652 Friday, the 12th of July.
###1655 My first hangover.
###1658 I felt like an orang-utan had been sick on my brain.
###1663 The big question is, one piece, bikini or monokini?
###1668 Well, where's the makes-you-not-look like-a-massive-bloater-kini?
###1675 What?
###1676 Nothing.
###1677 Well, come on, try them on.
###1683 'There was a time when I refused
###1686 'to wear anything other than a swimsuit.'
###1690 Will you help me get a pasty, please?
###1695 You shouldn't eat too many of these, you'll get fat.
###1698 I don't care if I get fat. They taste nice.
###1700 But if you get fat, you won't be able to wear a swimsuit
###1704 and boys won't like you.
###1705 I don't like boys.
###1707 And even if I did like boys
###1708 and I was fat and I wore a swimsuit, they'd like me anyway.
###1711 Why would they like you?
###1713 Because I'm brilliant.
###1715 Rae!
###1720 'There's no fucking way anyone's gonna see me in this.'
###1723 Phhhhh...
###1734 What are you doing?
###1736 Burning one?
###1737 But you don't smoke.
###1738 Well, I started yesterday.
###1740 You know, it keeps you thin.
###1746 We're evacuating the store. Yep.
###1748 We really need to get out of the store.
###1750 If you need to cover yourself up with this.
###1751 What? Excuse me, please. Thank you.
###1754 Let's just go, thank you.
###1761 Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, Rae.
###1764 Just ignore them, Rae.
###1773 Oi, Jabba! D'you want this burger? I've lost my appetite.
###1776 Rae? Jabba, Jabba, Jabba!
###1778 Oh, my God, no! What's going on?
###1780 Jabba, Jabba, Jabba! What's going on?
###1782 Just ignore them, Rae.
###1809 One.
###1812 Two.
###1814 Three.
###1816 Four. Five.
###1820 Six.
###1822 Seven.
###1826 Eight.
###1829 Nine.
###1905 I'm back.
###1907 I lasted, what?
###1909 Two days?
###1912 Something happened.
###1915 It was so embarrassing.
###1920 My skin feels itchy with it.
###1925 I hate to think that people would have gone home and...
###1928 talked about it...
###1931 like it was a joke...
###1934 over their Yorkshire puddings or summat.
###1942 It's too much out there.
###1947 I don't even know how to explain it.
###1952 It smashes up all of your senses.
###1959 I'm not strong enough to deal with it all on my own.
###1975 Tissue, please, Fatty.
###1996 What are you doing here?
###2000 I've, um...
###2002 I've got some good news.
###2003 What?
###2005 Decided to come back.
###2008 I just don't think I'm ready.
###2022 What are you doing?
###2024 Stop it! Stop it!
###2029 Just stop it!
###2033 Everyone in here is holding on to their lives by their fingertips, Rae.
###2036 And you get given a chance to start again
###2040 and you don't want it!
###2044 I don't like it out there.
###2046 No! You don't like it anywhere, because you don't like yourself.
###2052 You'd better start doing.
###2055 Because I've been trying to be more like you for months.
###2059 And if there's no hope for you then what hope is there for me?
###2064 What if something bad happened, something really bad?
###2068 I tried counting to ten, and it didn't work.
###2071 Then you put on your Rae armour and you charge at it.
###2079 Promise me you won't come back.
###2084 But I really miss you.
###2104 So, the pool party.
###2110 Turn up to a pool party with a bag of booze nicked from your mum,
###2112 and no-one'll care if you swim or not.
###2116 But how to escape?
###2125 Ah!
###2134 Jesus, Rae!
###2136 You've bloody ruined my flowerbeds.
###2140 All right, all right.
###2146 You smell like a brewery.
###2148 Next time you wanna borrow some booze, just ask.
###2151 We haven't got the right guttering for sneaking in and out of windows.
###2156 Take off your top off. Let's have a look at your back.
###2159 No! No way!
###2160 Come on. It's not like I haven't seen it all before.
###2162 When you were little, you used to run around naked all the time.
###2165 Yeah, well, I'm not a kid any more.
###2169 Karim.
###2174 Right, let's have a look at your back.
###2179 Ow!
###2180 Right, right. It's just a bruise.
###2182 OK.
###2191 You sure you're all right about going to the pub and things?
###2195 I do worry about you, you know.
###2197 I'm fine.
###2199 Are you still going to this pool thing today, then?
###2205 It doesn't matter what people think about you.
###2208 Yeah, you're not the one who has to stand in a swimming costume
###2211 next to Chloe with her gravity-defying boobs.
###2214 I'm gonna look like a condom filled with Bolognese sauce.
###2221 You remember when you were little, and we went to Butlin's,
###2224 and you said I had a big arse in front of Sally Crowther's parents?
###2229 No.
###2232 Why, did it upset you?
###2234 You get used to it.
###2237 Besides, I was sleeping
###2239 with Sally Crowther's dad at the time, so made no odds, really.
###2246 Got it. Yep.
###2252 I'm sorry about what I said the other day.
###2254 In the kitchen.
###2260 Wait.
###2262 Got it. Mum...
###2263 It's all right. Look, look, look.
###2264 Oh!
###2272 Rae?
###2277 Hey, Rae. Hey.
###2279 There's something different about you today.
###2282 Where's your inflatable crocodile?
###2285 Actually, I thought you were fantastic.
###2288 There's not many people that could have styled that out like you did.
###2291 Come on. Let's stay here and chat. I don't fancy a swim.
###2298 Why not?
###2299 I don't really wanna talk about it.
###2301 Tell me. No.
###2302 You'll laugh.
###2304 Maybe.
###2305 Um...
###2308 Well, er...
###2311 I've got spots on my back.
###2312 Like, back acne.
###2316 Bacne? Yeah.
###2318 Show me.
###2319 No way.
###2320 Show me.
###2322 Show me.
###2325 No laughing. All right.
###2330 'Oh, my God.
###2332 'Even his spots were really sexy!'
###2335 Well?
###2336 Well, there's hardly anything there. No-one's gonna see anything.
###2341 Look, let's make a deal. I'll go in if you go in.
###2346 All right.
###2352 Aarghhh...!
###2395 Stop it!
###2406 Is there something wrong?
###2408 No. Why?
###2409 So, why aren't you getting involved?
###2411 I'm DJ-ing. Dur.
###2413 Well, we don't need a DJ. Just stick on NOW 33.
###2417 Are you kidding me? It's got Father And Son by Boyzone on it.
###2420 Yeah, well, we'll just get out and skip it.
###2422 You're not gonna make friends if you sit on the sidelines all the time.
###2428 Are people talking about that?
###2431 They might be.
###2433 Look, you don't want people thinking you're weird, do you?
###2437 You don't want people thinking you're not normal.
###2440 Just come in.
###2445 You are boring.
###2464 Get on my back!
###2465 No! Get on my back.
###2466 I wanna see how long you can hold your breath.
###2484 Oh, God.
###2500 So, that's it. You went to a party...
###2503 and the party was OK.
###2509 Rae, these sessions are meant to be a time when you can open up,
###2514 discuss with someone, confidentially, how you're really feeling.
###2518 I told you. It was all right.
###2524 Tell me how you're feeling right now,
###2526 but be honest.
###2530 OK. I'll tell you how l feel, yeah?
###2534 Two weeks ago, my wife kicked me out.
###2536 I've been stopping on my brother's couch ever since.
###2539 This morning, I wake up, and there's no milk.
###2542 I bought that fucking milk, and he used it to drown his Sugar Puffs in.
###2545 So, with no cup of coffee, I come to work, I get shat on by a pigeon,
###2549 I meet my new patient, and she's about as open as a nun's foo.
###2557 So...how do you feel?
###2563 Pffff...
###2566 I feel like I hate being here.
###2571 I feel like I hate this room.
###2573 What do you hate most about it?
###2577 Well, the pictures.
###2578 They're shit.
###2596 Won't you get into trouble for that?
###2600 No. If anyone asks, I'll tell them that you did it.
###2601 I'll say you're lying.
###2603 Who will they believe? I'm not the one with a history of mental illness.
###2606 Oh, wow!
###2607 What about the ink blot?
###2609 Oh, that reminds me of a sanitary towel.
###2613 Then out it goes.
###2618 Oh!
###2621 What about Buster Keaton here?
###2624 No. I quite like that one.
###2629 Yeah. Me too.
###2639 What did your instincts say about me...
###2643 after five seconds?
###2648 I can't remember.
###2650 I don't believe you.
###2655 My instincts said...
###2659 that you see yourself as a fragile thing.
###2664 Like a little broken bird
###2666 sloshing around in a bottle.
###2669 But if you trust me, if we trust each other...
###2673 that you'll be all right.
###2677 Because, basically, I think you're a pretty tough cookie.
###2701 - Chop? - Yes, my dear.
###2704 Come and use those big swans you've been building
###2707 to prise my fat butt out of this slide.
###2709 Not a problem, Rae.
###2722 Barman! A lemon Hooch if you'd be so kind.
###2725 And turn that shit off.
###2735 Who's going to the chippy, cos I'm yamming?
###2738 Oh, maybe we should play a game for it.
###2740 All right. Yeah. I've got a good one.
###2742 What?
###2743 Maybe...
###2745 last one into the pool should go.
###2752 Whoo!
###2753 Weh-hey!
###2755 Whoo!
###2758 'The doctors looked at my legs and said didn't it hurt?
###2762 '"Didn't it hurt so much when you were doing it
###2765 '"that it burnt to breathe?"
###2767 'At least they remind me that I survived.
###2771 'But only just.
###2777 'I can't believe I've actually got a group of friends.
###2781 'I can't believe I'm finally out.'
###2785 'I can't believe they actually think I'm getting better.'
