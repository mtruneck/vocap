###0 what's not known uh... or not this customer is
###4 the massive
###7 contamination and and environmental disaster that happened in iraq
###11 and as a result
###13 uh... its
###14 it's cause massive deformities
###16 in children warning iraq right now so
###20 so deputy speaker livid about that ally depleted uranium essentially is what it
###25 is is depleted uranium season weaponry are primarily uh... because it
###29 candy penetrate armor
###31 and it was used
###32 a lot by the u_s_ troops said the u_n_ you can't take trips you some of it as
###36 well but um... though u_s_ troops
###38 he's quite a bit of a time in a more tell the u_n_
###42 and that anywhere where they use these area so that they can be decontaminated
###45 dot right now the uh... that the incidents of birth defects and
###49 deformities
###50 and communities doubt word targeted by u_s_ troops is is really astounding i
###56 i'm not sure what the exact number was i think we have some graphics on that we
###59 do uh... so
###61 the birth defects influenza uh... itself is working times higher
###65 uh... then in her rocha nine nagasaki after the party fun stuff
###70 and we have graphics of of the pictures of that
###73 kids patties extremely yes really ready to
###77 yet because we missed please look away is is that
###81 it's it's really interesting
###83 now this is not even counting the
###85 the many many babies who were citizens will have to have
###89 and that i had the doctors there say they have never seen this kind of the
###92 former before coming to this trial has hafter habits of guest intestines and
###97 organs after the body
###98 and multiple words
###103 so it's really cute depressing to see that that set that's what's going on
###106 also just said to to make a point of this that the united nations
###110 last december in the general assembly
###112 attempted to pass a resolution setting in which it is the precautionary
###116 principle when it comes to the use of depleted uranium
###119 but the u_s_
###120 the u_k_ france and israel voted against that resolution to take depleted uranium
###125 out of the next an again so hundred fifty five of the country said that we
###129 should stop using it and uh... partially united states is in favor of continuing
###134 and even though it has such an environmental destruction to the very
###136 difficult to clean up and the environment
###138 and it has is very clear connections to these these parents need to know if this
###143 is not just the iraqis were suffering it's our own soldiers to because um...
###147 there are a lot of soldiers who are also suffering from depleted uranium
###150 contaminations
###152 what happened to them if they're getting these massive headaches with their
###155 stability they can't move
###157 there are so urinating line
###158 round there at their date diagnosis cancer
###162 anticancer res influences
###164 through the roof uh...
###166 back in the nineties and used to be a after the after that rocked work in
###169 ninety one
###170 uh... there's cancer in her between forty and then with the pit eight
###173 hundred uh... people per one hundred thousand iraqis
###177 now that rate is above sixteen hundred uh... iraqis
###182 one hundred thousand so this is why i think a lot of young voters uh...
###185 sympathize with the libertarian party and why out you know you know ron paul
###189 didn't stand a chance
###191 the fact that he doesn't want to do these rediculous invasions and he
###195 doesn't want to
###196 by into the military industrial complex is very appealing to people such as
###200 myself
###201 now of course i hear libertarians lose me when it comes to certain other
###205 policies like fiscal policy but we need a party that will reject the notion
###211 that we need to invade other countries to spread democracy and of course that's
###215 always a facade that's not what we're really doing we're going to and i know
###218 what you think your honor the country i want to see what we're doing there
###221 we could see these pictures
###222 everyone's as these pictures i mean
###224 the mediation should show inspectors
###226 we did see pictures of a bar coffins of our soldiers coming back
###230 we can we're not sure that that's that's the failure of the mainstream press and
###235 it you know it's the duty of new media to get involved and to expose it which
###239 is why we're doing this story now however graphic it is
###242 uh... and and and the reason why the mainstream media doesn't cover these
###245 stories is because of something that we talk about on a regular basis on the
###249 shelf uh... you know they arb bought off by corporations uh... you don't think
###254 about how i'd be media covered uh... the iraq war leading up to the yatra i mean
###260 it was rediculous if u said anything against invading iraq you would have
###265 been shot and in the mainstream press with people were fired the dixie chicks
###271 albert just completely criticizing the mainstream media michael moore was
###274 completely criticizing the mainstream media phil donahue losses showing he was
###277 required to bring onto two adults two conservatives for
###281 his one being a liberal and
###283 other other correspondents field yes was bent i mean and
###288 they kept their other contractors from golden were awesome parker
###291 yeah antiwar rhetoric so that they just kept in a closet secures money diskeeper
###296 marge schott
###297 and to do that for a few years
###298 and that was by the so-called liberal and this n_b_c_ people
###302 because they're owned by g_e_ which is one of the main
###305 uh... defense contractors act so that we can see how money influences influences
###309 are media the media is bought
###310 uh... an apologist for bought
###312 that's why we stumbled into this war that we've never should have
###316 i what i want to read and i don't think there was stumbling you know i think we
###319 were actually closing hours remain and herded like cattle basically into this
###323 it was choreographed it was
###325 bought and paid for as you say you know the in the media via the entire military
###330 industrial complex everybody that had something to gain from this and even
###334 people who didn't
###335 got roped into pushing us into the warranty as if we have learned nothing
###339 nothing from that
