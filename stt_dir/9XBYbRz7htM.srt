<i> Narrator: This is

Bryan Smith: I've
hunted wild boar.


41
0:1:30,457 --> 0:1:31,791
I've wrestled
alligators.


42
0:1:31,791 --> 0:1:33,993
And I've lived in the
jungles of Costa Rica.


43
0:1:33,993 --> 0:1:37,597
And once I've had to shoot
a man in self-defense.


44
0:1:37,597 --> 0:1:40,433
<i> Narrator: Bryan Smith has
 lived an eventful life.</i>


45
0:1:40,433 --> 0:1:42,535
<i> He grew up in
 Central Florida,</i>


46
0:1:42,535 --> 0:1:44,437
<i> living off the land.</i>


47
0:1:44,437 --> 0:1:45,738
Bryan Smith: My
father growing up in


48
0:1:45,738 --> 0:1:48,274
South Alabama grew
up very poor working


49
0:1:48,274 --> 0:1:49,909
as a sharecropper.


50
0:1:49,909 --> 0:1:51,377
And so when he moved
down here to Florida,


51
0:1:51,377 --> 0:1:53,813
we still didn't have a
lot of luxury items and


52
0:1:53,813 --> 0:1:56,82
so part of our
bonding with our


53
0:1:56,82 --> 0:1:58,184
father was going
hunting all the time.


54
0:1:58,184 --> 0:2:0,42
But that's how we
kept our freezer full.


55
0:2:0,42 --> 0:2:3,289
<i> Narrator: Bryan didn't
 realize it at the time,</i>


56
0:2:3,289 --> 0:2:6,292
<i> but his childhood was
 a prepper handbook.</i>


57
0:2:6,292 --> 0:2:8,661
<i> When he grew up and got a
 good look at the world,</i>


58
0:2:8,661 --> 0:2:11,97
<i> he was grateful for his
 wilderness training</i>


59
0:2:11,97 --> 0:2:15,468
<i> because he thinks he's
 going to need it.</i>


60
0:2:15,468 --> 0:2:16,836
Bryan Smith: I'm
preparing for a total


61
0:2:16,836 --> 0:2:24,344
collapse of the U.S.
monetary system.


62
0:2:24,344 --> 0:2:26,579
Ron Hubbard:
(Bleep), Bryan.


63
0:2:26,579 --> 0:2:28,47
Bryan Smith: When
the Chinese start


64
0:2:28,47 --> 0:2:29,549
selling the U.S. dollar,


65
0:2:29,549 --> 0:2:31,618
you're going to see a
collapse of the U.S. dollar.


66
0:2:31,618 --> 0:2:33,419
And when they start
shutting down the banks


67
0:2:33,419 --> 0:2:36,189
that's when you're
going to feel the hurt.


68
0:2:36,189 --> 0:2:38,625
The urban areas are
gonna be a nightmare.


69
0:2:38,625 --> 0:2:41,27
Population densities
are so packed tight.


70
0:2:41,27 --> 0:2:43,163
Grocery stores are few
and far between and the


71
0:2:43,163 --> 0:2:44,964
produce isn't growing
anywhere near where the


72
0:2:44,964 --> 0:2:46,699
people consume it.


73
0:2:46,699 --> 0:2:48,101
Once people start
panicking and


74
0:2:48,101 --> 0:2:49,469
they realize they
can't get food


75
0:2:49,469 --> 0:2:51,137
you're looking
at total chaos.


76
0:2:51,137 --> 0:2:53,239
You're looking
at roving gangs.


77
0:2:53,239 --> 0:2:59,913
You're looking at the
worst-case scenario.


78
0:2:59,913 --> 0:3:2,15
One of the reasons I'm so
passionate about prepping


79
0:3:2,15 --> 0:3:6,519
is because I was raised
to not rely on anybody.


80
0:3:6,519 --> 0:3:8,121
You don't count
on the government,


81
0:3:8,121 --> 0:3:9,689
you don't count
on your neighbors,


82
0:3:9,689 --> 0:3:12,91
you count on
yourself first.


83
0:3:12,91 --> 0:3:13,826
<i> Narrator: The state of
 Florida has the fourth</i>


84
0:3:13,826 --> 0:3:17,263

86

<i> With such a high
 population,</i>


87

<i> Bryan fears an economic
 collapse will destroy the</i>

<i> quickly making
 food scarce and</i>


90

<i> he has a family
 of 12 to feed.</i>


91
0:3:33,479 --> 0:3:35,415
Bryan Smith: We've
stockpiled thousands of


92
0:3:35,415 --> 0:3:37,417
cans of freeze-dried food,


93
0:3:37,417 --> 0:3:40,954
along with close to a
ton of rice and beans.


94
0:3:40,954 --> 0:3:42,522
<i> Narrator: Bryan believes
 he has enough food</i>


95
0:3:42,522 --> 0:3:45,258
<i> to last his
 family one year.</i>


96
0:3:45,258 --> 0:3:46,826
<i> He currently stores
 most of it at his</i>


97
0:3:46,826 --> 0:3:51,331
<i> lamination factory, but
 his plan is to move it.</i>


98
0:3:51,331 --> 0:3:53,466
<i> He's spent a
 quarter-million dollars on</i>


99
0:3:53,466 --> 0:3:56,302
<i> 47 acres of land that
 will serve as his secret</i>

0:3:56,302 --> 0:3:59,372
<i> bug out location
 elsewhere in Florida.</i>


101
0:3:59,372 --> 0:4:2,141
<i> But these 47 acres
 aren't for growing more</i>


102
0:4:2,141 --> 0:4:4,41
<i> food for his family of 12.</i>


103
0:4:4,41 --> 0:4:6,279
<i> If the economy
 is destroyed,</i>


104
0:4:6,279 --> 0:4:9,549
<i> Bryan's plan is to
 grow his own money and</i>


105
0:4:9,549 --> 0:4:12,719
<i> create a veritable
 doomsday county store.</i>


106
0:4:12,719 --> 0:4:13,953
Bryan: Prepping
isn't just about


107
0:4:13,953 --> 0:4:15,521
surviving the collapse.


108
0:4:15,521 --> 0:4:17,79
It's about rebuilding
afterwards and


109
0:4:17,79 --> 0:4:19,425
we needed to have a
piece of property of


110
0:4:19,425 --> 0:4:21,16
our own where we
could grow resources


111
0:4:21,16 --> 0:4:22,996
that we can either
barter or trade.


112
0:4:22,996 --> 0:4:26,466
Our barter crop would be
tobacco or sugar cane.


113
0:4:26,466 --> 0:4:28,301
By having these products
for barter we can trade


114
0:4:28,301 --> 0:4:29,902
these for other
livestock and


115
0:4:29,902 --> 0:4:33,39
other farm grown goods.


116
0:4:33,39 --> 0:4:34,44
<i> Narrator: Today, tobacco</i>


117
0:4:34,44 --> 0:4:38,11
<i> is a $500 billion
 a year industry.</i>


118
0:4:38,11 --> 0:4:40,413
<i> But for Bryan's doomsday
 trading post business to</i>


119
0:4:40,413 --> 0:4:43,75
<i> show a profit the world
 will have to end.</i>


120
0:4:43,75 --> 0:4:45,451
Bryan Smith: Throughout
history when things


121
0:4:45,451 --> 0:4:47,587
collapse, you'll find that
the items that tend to


122
0:4:47,587 --> 0:4:50,456
bring the most money are
the ones that are kind of


123
0:4:50,456 --> 0:4:56,429
like the bad items, be it
coffee, alcohol, tobacco.


124
0:4:56,429 --> 0:4:57,864
The great thing
about sugarcane,


125
0:4:57,864 --> 0:4:59,32
it's going to
have a couple of


126
0:4:59,32 --> 0:5:0,133
uses in the future.


127
0:5:0,133 --> 0:5:2,135
One is the old
famous one: rum,


128
0:5:2,135 --> 0:5:4,537
which could be a great
barter item down the road.


129
0:5:4,537 --> 0:5:7,373
The other is we could
refine that down to 180


130
0:5:7,373 --> 0:5:9,575
proof and actually run
a generator that we've


131
0:5:9,575 --> 0:5:12,845
converted to work
on alcohol alone.


132
0:5:12,845 --> 0:5:15,81
<i> Narrator: Today,

<i> a childhood hunting buddy,
 the ropes of turning</i>

<i> sugarcane into alcohol, so
 that Matt can one day join</i>


135
0:5:20,52 --> 0:5:23,69
<i> Bryan's post-apocalyptic
 business venture.</i>


136
0:5:23,69 --> 0:5:25,825
Bryan Smith: What's gonna
happen is the alcohol will


137
0:5:25,825 --> 0:5:29,95
vaporize and it's gonna
flow up through this tube


138
0:5:29,95 --> 0:5:31,798
here and then come back
down and condense.


139
0:5:31,798 --> 0:5:33,599
And once it condenses
it'll go into this cooling


140
0:5:33,599 --> 0:5:36,969
tower to cool and as it
goes through then it'll


141
0:5:36,969 --> 0:5:39,672
start dripping out
alcohol on this side.


142
0:5:39,672 --> 0:5:41,207
Matt: Up in my part of
the country in Kentucky


143
0:5:41,207 --> 0:5:42,308
that's called a still.


144
0:5:42,308 --> 0:5:43,409
Bryan Smith: Yeah,
that's basically


145
0:5:43,409 --> 0:5:44,811
what they're doing.


146
0:5:44,811 --> 0:5:46,846
This is something
that if we perfect it,


147
0:5:46,846 --> 0:5:48,247
bring it up to scale;


148
0:5:48,247 --> 0:5:52,352
you could produce
20, 30 gallons a day.


149
0:5:52,352 --> 0:5:54,2
<i> Narrator: In addition
 to bartering it,</i>


150
0:5:54,2 --> 0:5:56,255
<i> Bryan's distilled
 alcohol will also</i>


151
0:5:56,255 --> 0:5:57,657
<i> power his generator.</i>


152
0:5:57,657 --> 0:5:59,292
Matt: All right, let's
fire this thing up.


153
0:5:59,292 --> 0:6:5,965
Let's see if it runs.


154
0:6:5,965 --> 0:6:7,967
<i> Narrator: Bryan plans
 to use his generator to</i>


155
0:6:7,967 --> 0:6:10,837
<i> collect perhaps his
 most vital prep.</i>


156
0:6:10,837 --> 0:6:12,205
Bryan Smith: One of the
most important things


157
0:6:12,205 --> 0:6:15,241
in a survival situation is
water or access to water.


158
0:6:15,241 --> 0:6:17,276
<i> Narrator: Finding water
 can be a tantalizing</i>


159
0:6:17,276 --> 0:6:19,712
<i> challenge for
 Florida-based preppers,</i>


160
0:6:19,712 --> 0:6:22,181
<i> because it's so
 close to the surface.</i>


161
0:6:22,181 --> 0:6:25,84
<i> The state sits on top of
 the Floridian aquifer,</i>


162
0:6:25,84 --> 0:6:28,521
<i> nearly 100,000 square
 miles of water running</i>


163
0:6:28,521 --> 0:6:30,79
<i> under the entire state.</i>


164
0:6:30,79 --> 0:6:33,359
<i> If the grid goes down,
 Bryan's alcohol-powered</i>


165
0:6:33,359 --> 0:6:37,563
<i> generator will pump that
 water to the surface.</i>


166
0:6:37,563 --> 0:6:39,198
Matt: We got fresh
well water coming out


167
0:6:39,198 --> 0:6:42,468
of the ground, because
of distilled alcohol.


168
0:6:42,468 --> 0:6:43,369
Bryan Smith: Yep.


169
0:6:43,369 --> 0:6:45,4
Now if you run
that for an hour,


170
0:6:45,4 --> 0:6:47,507
at 40 gallons a
minute, you're at


171
0:6:47,507 --> 0:6:49,442
2,400 gallons
in an hour.


172
0:6:49,442 --> 0:6:53,579
So you could run that just
once a week for an hour.


173
0:6:53,579 --> 0:6:55,248
<i> Narrator: If
 doomsday comes,</i>


174
0:6:55,248 --> 0:6:57,784
<i> Bryan's entire plan for
 pumping water could fall</i>


175
0:6:57,784 --> 0:7:0,753
<i> apart if he can't
 grow his sugarcane.</i>


176
0:7:0,753 --> 0:7:3,89
<i> But the tractor he
 plans to use to sow his</i>


177
0:7:3,89 --> 0:7:6,392
<i> 47 acres of land

<i> not distilled alcohol.</i>

<i> Bryan's worried an
 economic collapse</i>


180
0:7:10,63 --> 0:7:12,765
<i> could bring severe

<i> so he's on the hunt for
 alternative fuel sources.</i>


182
0:7:15,535 --> 0:7:17,603
<i> And he thinks he's

<i> electrical transformers.</i>


184
0:7:19,672 --> 0:7:21,441
Bryan Smith:
All right Matt,


185
0:7:21,441 --> 0:7:24,277
I always wanted
to test this out.


186
0:7:24,277 --> 0:7:26,512
Transformers are supposed
to have an oil in it,


187
0:7:26,512 --> 0:7:28,514
mineral oil that we
can run in a tractor.


188
0:7:28,514 --> 0:7:30,516
And of course the power'd
be off when we did this.


189
0:7:30,516 --> 0:7:31,551
Matt: Right.


190
0:7:31,551 --> 0:7:32,685
Bryan Smith: So my goal
is to go ahead and


191
0:7:32,685 --> 0:7:34,587
see if we can just
shoot it with a gun.


192
0:7:34,587 --> 0:7:35,521
Let it drain out.


193
0:7:35,521 --> 0:7:36,923
We'd just put a
bucket and catch it.


194
0:7:36,923 --> 0:7:38,357
What do you think?


195
0:7:38,357 --> 0:7:40,126
Matt: Well, that's
one way of doing it.


196
0:7:40,126 --> 0:7:41,494
You could probably
chainsaw it down too,


197
0:7:41,494 --> 0:7:42,995
but that could get
a little destructive


198
0:7:42,995 --> 0:7:44,163
and messy.


199
0:7:44,163 --> 0:7:46,199
<i> Narrator: Mineral oil

200
0:7:46,199 --> 0:7:47,867

201
0:7:47,867 --> 0:7:50,703
<i> The oil is flammable,

202
0:7:50,703 --> 0:7:53,139

203
0:7:53,139 --> 0:7:55,441

204
0:7:55,441 --> 0:7:59,278
<i> forever, Bryan's willing
 to run the risk.</i>


205
0:7:59,278 --> 0:8:1,47
Bryan Smith: I've never
shot a transformer before,


206
0:8:1,47 --> 0:8:7,42
so let's see what happens.


207
0:8:7,42 --> 0:8:10,69
Matt: Ah, messy
stream, man.


208
0:8:10,69 --> 0:8:13,25
'Cause it's not
flowing clean, is it?


209
0:8:13,25 --> 0:8:15,161
Bryan Smith: Really
could shoot it again.


210
0:8:15,161 --> 0:8:16,662
I think I'd do
a lot better.


211
0:8:16,662 --> 0:8:17,697
Matt: You wanna try it?


212
0:8:17,697 --> 0:8:18,798
Bryan Smith: Yep, let's
see if I can shoot


213
0:8:18,798 --> 0:8:19,632
it one more time.


214
0:8:19,632 --> 0:8:22,168
Matt: Nail it this time.


215
0:8:22,168 --> 0:8:23,636
There you go.


216
0:8:23,636 --> 0:8:27,707
Bryan Smith: Hang on.


217
0:8:27,707 --> 0:8:32,612
Matt: Wow, oil shower.


218
0:8:32,612 --> 0:8:33,412
Bryan Smith:
Come on, Matt;


219
0:8:33,412 --> 0:8:37,884
give me a hand with this.


220
0:8:37,884 --> 0:8:40,119
Well, we'd have to
perfect this later.


221
0:8:40,119 --> 0:8:43,155
I think we uh, put a
funnel on a stick.


222
0:8:43,155 --> 0:8:44,56
Matt: Yeah.


223
0:8:44,56 --> 0:8:46,292
Bryan Smith: Hooked
to a garden hose.


224
0:8:46,292 --> 0:8:49,228
Matt: Need a higher
caliber weapon next time.


225
0:8:49,228 --> 0:8:50,196
Bryan Smith: Yup.


226
0:8:50,196 --> 0:8:53,99
Matt: Grab that bucket.


227
0:8:53,99 --> 0:8:56,969
All right,
lift your end.


228
0:8:56,969 --> 0:8:59,338
Bingo.


229
0:8:59,338 --> 0:9:1,908
Messy but it works.


230
0:9:1,908 --> 0:9:3,276
I think we got
about 10 gallons


231
0:9:3,276 --> 0:9:4,277
all together, Bryan.


232
0:9:4,277 --> 0:9:5,444
We got two buckets.


233
0:9:5,444 --> 0:9:6,712
Bryan Smith: That's
not bad, dude.


234
0:9:6,712 --> 0:9:8,147
Matt: We wasted probably
another 5 gallons


235
0:9:8,147 --> 0:9:9,215
in the beginning, but.


236
0:9:9,215 --> 0:9:11,284
Bryan Smith: That'll run
a tractor all day long.


237

Bryan Smith: All right,

0:9:28,534 --> 0:9:30,403

it's half the battle.


264
0:10:28,995 --> 0:10:32,198
The other half of it is
coming back from that.


265

273

0:10:58,724 --> 0:11:0,126
manufacturing
our own ammo,


275
0:11:0,126 --> 0:11:3,529
or reloading our own ammo
after it has been used.


276
0:11:3,529 --> 0:11:4,93
Currently we have a
couple hundred thousand


277
0:11:4,93 --> 0:11:6,332
rounds of ammunition and


278
0:11:6,332 --> 0:11:7,667
we have the
capabilities of easily


279
0:11:7,667 --> 0:11:10,77

Bryan Smith: Let me walk
you through the process,

0:11:22,314 --> 0:11:24,917
I'll show you the 380.


286
0:11:24,917 --> 0:11:27,82
Ok, you've got your
automatic primer feed,


287
0:11:27,82 --> 0:11:30,156
your powder and
your shell casings.


288
0:11:30,156 --> 0:11:33,225
And basically,
just raise it up,


289
0:11:33,225 --> 0:11:36,162
put a projectile on,
pull it back down,


290
0:11:36,162 --> 0:11:38,23
it does all the
steps progressively,


291
0:11:38,23 --> 0:11:41,0
they call it.


292
0:11:41,0 --> 0:11:42,234
Matt: How many
can you spit out


293
0:11:42,234 --> 0:11:43,502
an hour like that?


294
0:11:43,502 --> 0:11:44,837
Bryan Smith: This
can be comfortably


295
0:11:44,837 --> 0:11:46,439
about 650 an hour.


296
0:11:46,439 --> 0:11:47,807
Now what you do is as
you're running along


297
0:11:47,807 --> 0:11:50,109
you'll take 'em out and
you've got a caliber gauge


298
0:11:50,109 --> 0:11:53,779
here that is made the
same size as the barrel


299
0:11:53,779 --> 0:11:55,648
on the pistol or the rifle
you're gonna be using.


300
0:11:55,648 --> 0:11:58,451
You slide that in,
it goes down flush,


301
0:11:58,451 --> 0:11:59,185
it's perfect.


302
0:11:59,185 --> 0:12:0,352
It'll run
through the gun.


303
0:12:0,352 --> 0:12:1,353
Matt: Quality check.


304
0:12:1,353 --> 0:12:2,354
Bryan Smith: All
right, you want to


305
0:12:2,354 --> 0:12:3,355
try this real easy?


306
0:12:3,355 --> 0:12:4,523
Matt: So you're saying
I can do about 6,000


307
0:12:4,523 --> 0:12:5,691
of these a day if I
wanna spend an afternoon,


308
0:12:5,691 --> 0:12:6,792
right?


309
0:12:6,792 --> 0:12:7,793
Bryan Smith: Yeah.


310
0:12:7,793 --> 0:12:9,562
Matt: We got an
ammunitions factory here.


311
0:12:9,562 --> 0:12:11,764
Bryan Smith: It adds
up quick you know.


312
0:12:11,764 --> 0:12:13,332
<i> Narrator: Bryan
 has set himself up to</i>


313
0:12:13,332 --> 0:12:16,335
<i> manufacture 9 different
 types of ammunition,</i>


314
0:12:16,335 --> 0:12:18,437
<i> so that all his
 various firearms will</i>


315
0:12:18,437 --> 0:12:20,84
<i> remain fully loaded.</i>


316
0:12:20,84 --> 0:12:22,508
Bryan Smith: One of the
preps that we've done


317
0:12:22,508 --> 0:12:24,41
is over time acquired
a lot of firearms.


318
0:12:24,41 --> 0:12:25,778
If something does
happen we're able to


319
0:12:25,778 --> 0:12:29,315
arm ourselves very well.


320
0:12:29,315 --> 0:12:31,383
We become more of a
force to be reckoned with


321
0:12:31,383 --> 0:12:33,119
so we can keep
away gangs.


322
0:12:33,119 --> 0:12:35,187
Gangs are going to look
for softer targets.


323
0:12:35,187 --> 0:12:36,856
Some of the other
weapons we have are


324
0:12:36,856 --> 0:12:38,758
what they call
any-other weapons.


325
0:12:38,758 --> 0:12:40,793
Like say, one of
them is a walking cane


326
0:12:40,793 --> 0:12:44,63
that shoots a .38
caliber pistol round.


327
0:12:44,63 --> 0:12:46,565
The other is a pen that
shoots a 25 automatic


328
0:12:46,565 --> 0:12:51,27
pistol round and the other
one is a firearm that is


329
0:12:51,27 --> 0:12:53,372
hidden in your sleeve
and just pops out like


330
0:12:53,372 --> 0:12:57,777
a little James
Bond weapon.


331
0:12:57,777 --> 0:12:59,745
If you walk around with
a firearm that looks


332
0:12:59,745 --> 0:13:1,714
aggressive and mean,
it often can get


333
0:13:1,714 --> 0:13:3,182
you into trouble.


334
0:13:3,182 --> 0:13:5,451
These things can be
concealed on you and


335
0:13:5,451 --> 0:13:7,453
you can look like somebody
who's struggling just to


336
0:13:7,453 --> 0:13:14,16
survive and you don't look
like you're aggressive.


337

the automobile.


375
0:14:37,843 --> 0:14:40,679
I've made 'em affordable
enough that you don't have


376
0:14:40,679 --> 0:14:44,183
to be a multimillionaire
to have a shelter.


377
0:14:44,183 --> 0:14:46,185
<i> Narrator: Ron has had
 another Los Angeles based</i>


378
0:14:46,185 --> 0:14:50,55
<i> business selling iron
 doors for 25 years.</i>


379
0:14:50,55 --> 0:14:52,791
<i> He used that experience
 to design one of the key</i>


380
0:14:52,791 --> 0:14:57,229
<i> features of his bunkers,
 an airtight blast door.</i>


381
0:14:57,229 --> 0:14:59,164
Ron Hubbard: See
this bulkhead.


382
0:14:59,164 --> 0:15:1,5
This is our
patented design.


383
0:15:1,5 --> 0:15:2,801
The doors are laser cut;


384
0:15:2,801 --> 0:15:4,87
they close with
laser precision.


385
0:15:4,87 --> 0:15:6,705
I can't even get my
fingernail in there.


386
0:15:6,705 --> 0:15:9,508
You see that, you can't
even see the daylight.


387
0:15:9,508 --> 0:15:10,876
So when this door closes,


388
0:15:10,876 --> 0:15:12,578
it will become an
airtight door.


389
0:15:12,578 --> 0:15:16,682
Someone finds your
hatch on the surface and


390
0:15:16,682 --> 0:15:19,652
they try to drop a smoke
grenade, hand grenade,


391
0:15:19,652 --> 0:15:22,154
gases, anything, you've
got an airlock between the


392
0:15:22,154 --> 0:15:24,957
shelter and the hatch so
the fumes won't get in,


393
0:15:24,957 --> 0:15:26,492
which will give you
time to go through your


394
0:15:26,492 --> 0:15:28,994
escape tunnel come
up underground and


395
0:15:28,994 --> 0:15:31,297
shoot 'em in the
back if you need to.


396
0:15:31,297 --> 0:15:33,666
The people buying
shelters they


397
0:15:33,666 --> 0:15:36,68
may be lawyers, doctors.


398
0:15:36,68 --> 0:15:38,47
But the one that
surprises me the most


399
0:15:38,47 --> 0:15:41,54
is the amount of current
military officers


400
0:15:41,54 --> 0:15:44,61
wanting shelters
for their families.


401
0:15:44,61 --> 0:15:46,378
<i> Narrator: When bunkers
 made from shipping</i>


402
0:15:46,378 --> 0:15:48,347
<i> containers are buried,
 all the weight of the</i>


403
0:15:48,347 --> 0:15:51,784
<i> ground above pushes
 down on the flat roof.</i>


404
0:15:51,784 --> 0:15:54,386
<i> But cylindrical bunkers
 distribute that weight</i>


405
0:15:54,386 --> 0:15:56,488
<i> all along their outer edge.</i>


406
0:15:56,488 --> 0:15:59,725
<i> This allows Ron to bury
 some of his bunkers as</i>


407
0:15:59,725 --> 0:16:2,561
<i> deep as four stories
 underground.</i>


408
0:16:2,561 --> 0:16:4,196
Ron Hubbard: My most
popular type is the


409
0:16:4,196 --> 0:16:6,98
galvanized
corrugated pipe.


410
0:16:6,98 --> 0:16:8,133
What makes these shelters
strong is that they're


411
0:16:8,133 --> 0:16:10,669
round they're galvanized
so they're gonna last


412
0:16:10,669 --> 0:16:14,73
for 200 years, and you
can bury them deeper.


413
0:16:14,73 --> 0:16:16,675
The shelter we're doing
for Bryan is basically


414
0:16:16,675 --> 0:16:18,677
gonna have all the
features of home,


415
0:16:18,677 --> 0:16:20,145
the only difference
is he's gonna be


416
0:16:20,145 --> 0:16:22,348
20 feet underground.


417
0:16:22,348 --> 0:16:25,551
He'll have running water,
he'll have electricity,


418
0:16:25,551 --> 0:16:28,53
he'll be completely off
the grid so he's not


419
0:16:28,53 --> 0:16:31,156
dependent upon
anybody else.


420
0:16:31,156 --> 0:16:33,292

 decades of friendship and</i>

<i> Bryan is still
 Ron's client and</i>


423
0:16:37,629 --> 0:16:40,899
<i> one who expects perfection
 from his bunker.</i>


424
0:16:40,899 --> 0:16:42,701
Ron Hubbard: This guy's
the ultimate prepper.


425
0:16:42,701 --> 0:16:45,604
He's going to be very
critical of anything I,


426
0:16:45,604 --> 0:16:49,942
I do or uh do wrong, okay,
so I'm gonna make sure


427
0:16:49,942 --> 0:16:52,611
that his shelter is the
best that I can do.


428
0:16:52,611 --> 0:16:55,848
All right, when I
say kill it, kill it.


429
0:16:55,848 --> 0:16:58,117
Just do what I say!


430
0:16:58,117 --> 0:16:59,184
I am the boss;


431
0:16:59,184 --> 0:17:0,686
what I say goes.


432
0:17:0,686 --> 0:17:3,789
Even though these are
bomb shelters, uh to me,


433
0:17:3,789 --> 0:17:6,25
they're homes and
I want them built to


434
0:17:6,25 --> 0:17:7,426
new home standards.


435
0:17:7,426 --> 0:17:12,131
I want Bryan to be blown
away, not literally.


436
0:17:12,131 --> 0:17:13,799
Let's get everything
right the first time.


437
0:17:13,799 --> 0:17:15,434
I can't, I don't have
time to back up and


438
0:17:15,434 --> 0:17:17,436
get anything
done over again.


439

Dave: Always on
a time crunch.


440
0:17:18,47 --> 0:17:20,506

0:18:7,152 --> 0:18:8,2

0:18:8,2 --> 0:18:8,821
What is this?


463
0:18:8,821 --> 0:18:10,155
Is this 3/8ths inch steel?


464
0:18:10,155 --> 0:18:11,356
Ron Hubbard: Yeah, yeah.


465
0:18:11,356 --> 0:18:12,524
That should stop
pretty much every


466
0:18:12,524 --> 0:18:13,959
bullet out there.


467
0:18:13,959 --> 0:18:15,828
Bryan Smith: How about a
gun port or something?


468
0:18:15,828 --> 0:18:18,23

gonna give up your,


469
0:18:18,23 --> 0:18:20,866
your airlock
capability if you have


470
0:18:20,866 --> 0:18:22,601
a way that they
could pierce it,


471
0:18:22,601 --> 0:18:24,736
so I don't, I
thought about it and


472
0:18:24,736 --> 0:18:26,872
I don't want to
put one in there.


473
0:18:26,872 --> 0:18:28,373
Bryan Smith: Ron's one of
the smartest people I've


474
0:18:28,373 --> 0:18:30,742
ever seen but whenever
you're speaking to him he


475
0:18:30,742 --> 0:18:32,311
always seems like he's
already figuring out what


476
0:18:32,311 --> 0:18:34,446
he's going to say next
without listening.


477
0:18:34,446 --> 0:18:35,447
Trust me.

will think of, I've
already thought of and


480
0:18:38,217 --> 0:18:40,919
I've shot down or I've
built it into the shelter.

<i> He wants the bunker buried
 close to a water source,</i>

<i> which could
 compromise its safety.</i>


497
0:19:14,353 --> 0:19:17,456
Ron Hubbard: The best time
to go pick the spot for


498
0:19:17,456 --> 0:19:20,392
your shelter is when
you're having an inch of


499
0:19:20,392 --> 0:19:23,362
rain and you can see the
areas that's getting


500
0:19:23,362 --> 0:19:25,13
pounded and the area
that's high and


501
0:19:25,13 --> 0:19:26,365
dry even with the rain.


502
0:19:26,365 --> 0:19:27,566

I own the property.


503
0:19:27,566 --> 0:19:29,101

the water zone.

Ron Hubbard: You don't
know every spot where.

Bryan Smith: I've lived
here forever, okay?


506
0:19:33,906 --> 0:19:35,541

So he doesn't have to
worry about the guy


555
0:21:20,679 --> 0:21:22,981
showing up at his shelter
in case of a crisis.


556
0:21:22,981 --> 0:21:26,785
So we use as few local
resources as possible.


557
0:21:26,785 --> 0:21:29,154
The shelters are
buried 20 feet deep.


558
0:21:29,154 --> 0:21:30,889
That basically means
that you're gonna end up


559
0:21:30,889 --> 0:21:34,159
with 10 foot of dirt
on top of your roof.


560
0:21:34,159 --> 0:21:37,195
Which is more than
enough protection


561
0:21:37,195 --> 0:21:38,797
from gamma radiation.


562
0:21:38,797 --> 0:21:42,134
It is also deep enough
that you have enough dirt


563
0:21:42,134 --> 0:21:43,835
and sod above you
that you're going to


564
0:21:43,835 --> 0:21:54,546
keep a constant
temperature down there.


565
0:21:54,546 --> 0:21:55,881
We got it.


566
0:21:55,881 --> 0:21:58,417
Whoa.


567
0:21:58,417 --> 0:21:58,984
We got it.


568
0:21:58,984 --> 0:22:1,987
Hold it.


569
0:22:1,987 --> 0:22:4,456
We put this rock down
here so the radius


570
0:22:4,456 --> 0:22:6,491
doesn't squash when
all the downward force


571
0:22:6,491 --> 0:22:8,96
and all the dirt
is filled in on top.


572
0:22:8,96 --> 0:22:11,63
So it needs that support.


573
0:22:11,63 --> 0:22:15,634
I knew I should have
been a stockbroker.


574
0:22:15,634 --> 0:22:18,3
Do you want me to choke
the chain a little more?


575
0:22:18,3 --> 0:22:19,838
Dave: This is gonna
be the escape tunnel,


576
0:22:19,838 --> 0:22:21,54
which is probably
gonna go straight up


577
0:22:21,54 --> 0:22:23,308
or off to the side.


578
0:22:23,308 --> 0:22:26,645
Ron Hubbard: Go down.


579
0:22:26,645 --> 0:22:40,325
Okay, hold on.


580

0:23:19,865 --> 0:23:22,868
It's always a fun thing
to see your shelter


595
0:23:22,868 --> 0:23:25,67

596
0:23:25,67 --> 0:23:28,173

597
0:23:28,173 --> 0:23:29,908
Is this cool?


598
0:23:29,908 --> 0:23:30,976
Bryan Smith: Yeah.


599
0:23:30,976 --> 0:23:32,778
Ron Hubbard: I put you in
a bathtub with a shower.


600
0:23:32,778 --> 0:23:35,46
I put a flushing toilet.


601
0:23:35,46 --> 0:23:39,985
You're gonna
like this Bryan.


602
0:23:39,985 --> 0:23:40,952
A dinner table.


603
0:23:40,952 --> 0:23:42,721
Sit down.


604
0:23:42,721 --> 0:23:43,455
Bryan Smith:
I like this.


605
0:23:43,455 --> 0:23:44,423
You know why?


606
0:23:44,423 --> 0:23:46,91
Most people don't
realize a major part


607
0:23:46,91 --> 0:23:47,793
of our survival
is just eating.


608
0:23:47,793 --> 0:23:49,494
And when you're in a
stressed situation like


609
0:23:49,494 --> 0:23:51,663
this, it gives you some
sense of normalcy when you


610
0:23:51,663 --> 0:23:53,799
can sit back down with
your family, eat a meal.


611
0:23:53,799 --> 0:23:54,9
I like that.


612
0:23:54,9 --> 0:23:56,201

storage under it?


613

Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Smith:
Good deal.


616
0:23:59,671 --> 0:24:1,84
Ron Hubbard: There's
no space left unused.


617
0:24:1,84 --> 0:24:4,676
Anywhere I can put
storage I got storage.

55 gallon drums.


627
0:24:21,56 --> 0:24:22,527

628
0:24:22,527 --> 0:24:24,196

all your appliances.

Your macerator pump.


631
0:24:26,331 --> 0:24:27,432
Your hand pump.


632
0:24:27,432 --> 0:24:29,935
Bryan, this is probably
the most important thing


633
0:24:29,935 --> 0:24:31,236
in the whole shelter.


634
0:24:31,236 --> 0:24:34,72
This is your NBC air
filtration system.


635
0:24:34,72 --> 0:24:35,14
Bryan Smith: Right.


636
0:24:35,14 --> 0:24:36,308
Ron Hubbard: This is
what's gonna filter out


637
0:24:36,308 --> 0:24:37,943
anything that's in the air
that's gonna kill you.


638
0:24:37,943 --> 0:24:39,277
It's gonna come through
this pipe here,


639
0:24:39,277 --> 0:24:40,779
it's gonna filter
through this and


640
0:24:40,779 --> 0:24:42,481
it's gonna make
it breathable air.

Bryan Smith: Well, I think
that's a little ridiculous.


748
0:28:32,444 --> 0:28:34,245
My family's lived
here for 9 generations,


749
0:28:34,245 --> 0:28:36,548
150 years, and
over 100 of that was


750
0:28:36,548 --> 0:28:39,651
without electricity
or giant water stores.


751
0:28:39,651 --> 0:28:41,286
I think we're
very prepared.


752
0:28:41,286 --> 0:28:46,391
I think your experts
are a little off.


753
0:28:46,391 --> 0:28:48,626
Since filming, we've
continued to add to


754
0:28:48,626 --> 0:28:50,595
our store of
food supplies.


755
0:28:50,595 --> 0:28:52,23
We bought some of
the most advanced

there, lightweight.


757
0:28:54,532 --> 0:28:55,633
Pretty nice stuff.


758
0:28:55,633 --> 0:28:57,469
By far one of the most
interesting thing is,


759
0:28:57,469 --> 0:28:59,3
since going through the
process of buying a


760
0:28:59,3 --> 0:29:1,39
shelter and watching
it being made and


761
0:29:1,39 --> 0:29:2,741

I've started

shelter business to

0:31:5,496 --> 0:31:6,631
even when I came back.


821
0:31:6,631 --> 0:31:8,199
There were down

everywhere.

0:31:9,567 --> 0:31:11,202
Standing water.

If that wind had
taken a turn,

I would have no more

were to come up.

0:32:3,354 --> 0:32:6,9

A lot of these houses are
prefab, vinyl siding.


848

There isn't much
protection.


849
0:32:9,894 --> 0:32:14,98

gather supplies
that I need.


863

that we've converted.


865
0:32:47,432 --> 0:32:49,6

back the vans up and

load it up.

Some months I might
have a little bit more.


886
0:33:25,103 --> 0:33:26,804

0:34:27,265 --> 0:34:29,534
personally would have
needed in this situation,


924
0:34:29,534 --> 0:34:31,602
whereas she feels
like every situation


925
0:34:31,602 --> 0:34:33,104
she's got covered.


926

<i> Narrator: To be able to
 bug-out with as much as</i>


927
0:34:35,39 --> 0:34:37,708
<i> possible, Christine has
 learned organizational</i>


928
0:34:37,708 --> 0:34:40,912
<i> tricks to consolidate
 her food preps,</i>


929
0:34:40,912 --> 0:34:42,547
<i> like storing
 an entire meal of</i>


930
0:34:42,547 --> 0:34:45,349
<i> freeze-dried
 foods in one jar.</i>


931
0:34:45,349 --> 0:34:47,151
Christine: We're gonna
make a meal in a jar.


932
0:34:47,151 --> 0:34:49,42
What this is gonna do is
take our food storage down


933
0:34:49,42 --> 0:34:51,22
to a smaller capacity
and we're gonna have a


934
0:34:51,22 --> 0:34:52,39
complete meal ready to go.


935
0:34:52,39 --> 0:34:53,691
From these
ingredients here


936
0:34:53,691 --> 0:34:55,59
we can put together
a quick soup.


937
0:34:55,59 --> 0:34:56,427
Daughter: So this
is like a dinner?


938
0:34:56,427 --> 0:34:57,495
Christine: This
is a dinner.


939
0:34:57,495 --> 0:34:58,696
That fits in a jar.


940
0:34:58,696 --> 0:35:0,364
I want you
to go ahead and


941
0:35:0,364 --> 0:35:1,899
just get about
half a scoop there.


942
0:35:1,899 --> 0:35:3,201
We're gonna start
with a meat base.


943
0:35:3,201 --> 0:35:4,902
What I have
here is chicken.


944
0:35:4,902 --> 0:35:6,671
What's something else
that's great to go along


945
0:35:6,671 --> 0:35:7,905
with protein when
you're thinking of a


946
0:35:7,905 --> 0:35:9,774
survival situation?


947
0:35:9,774 --> 0:35:10,975
Carbohydrates.


948
0:35:10,975 --> 0:35:12,577
And we want our
jars to be colorful.


949
0:35:12,577 --> 0:35:15,746
We have some carrots,
corn, a little celery.


950
0:35:15,746 --> 0:35:17,148
You have your
antioxidants,


951
0:35:17,148 --> 0:35:19,65
you have your vitamins,
you have your minerals;


952
0:35:19,65 --> 0:35:21,519
this is a healthy meal.


953
0:35:21,519 --> 0:35:24,155
I would also suggest,
drop a chicken bouillon


954
0:35:24,155 --> 0:35:25,79
cube in here and that's
gonna give you all


955
0:35:25,79 --> 0:35:27,625
your chicken seasoning
and everything.


956
0:35:27,625 --> 0:35:29,861
You're gonna
simply add about


957
0:35:29,861 --> 0:35:32,63
one cup of water to
this whole thing.


958
0:35:32,63 --> 0:35:33,231
Let it sit.


959
0:35:33,231 --> 0:35:34,732
And then you can
actually heat this up


960
0:35:34,732 --> 0:35:36,0
straight in the jar.


961
0:35:36,0 --> 0:35:37,969
This here is going
to be good for about


962
0:35:37,969 --> 0:35:39,737
six months to a year.


963
0:35:39,737 --> 0:35:42,54
Chrissy: Wow.


964

<i> Narrator: Christine

one of the key elements


1000
0:37:5,89 --> 0:37:7,892
for any prepper
is to be organized.


1001
0:37:7,892 --> 0:37:9,427

sure there's a

0:37:10,661 --> 0:37:12,53
You walk in and it's
nice, neat and orderly.


1004
0:37:12,53 --> 0:37:13,764
We know exactly
what we need and


1005
0:37:13,764 --> 0:37:14,699
where to get it from.


1006
0:37:14,699 --> 0:37:15,9
I need your help.

1014

is left in the driveway.

yourself wondering
what you've forgotten.

0:37:36,87 --> 0:37:38,823
<i> Narrator: She's giving her

1019
0:37:41,292 --> 0:37:42,426

guys, I'm gonna want


1020

you to start over here.


1021
0:37:43,461 --> 0:37:45,162

that water over there.

We're working on the
sanitation over here.


1023
0:37:47,832 --> 0:37:49,4
You have the
maps, the candles,


1024
0:37:49,4 --> 0:37:51,836
the can opener, the
knives, the matches,


1025
0:37:51,836 --> 0:37:54,71
the lighters,
the batteries?


1026
0:37:54,71 --> 0:37:56,73
I believe under pressure
women are more detail


1027
0:37:56,73 --> 0:37:58,376
oriented and men
on the other hand,


1028
0:37:58,376 --> 0:37:59,977
they're your brawn,
they're your strength.


1029
0:37:59,977 --> 0:38:1,712
So we can use that
to our advantage.


1030
0:38:1,712 --> 0:38:3,514
If we're organized and
then we can put them


1031
0:38:3,514 --> 0:38:4,649
to work to get
the job done.


1032
0:38:4,649 --> 0:38:5,65

the strong silent type


1035
0:38:8,152 --> 0:38:10,421
whereas I have no
problem barking orders.


1036
0:38:10,421 --> 0:38:12,59
We need some
paper products.


1037
0:38:12,59 --> 0:38:14,692
Toilet paper, tissue.


1038
0:38:14,692 --> 0:38:16,994
Don't forget over here,
I need all the milk.


1039
0:38:16,994 --> 0:38:18,929
Okay, we need to speed
this up a little bit.


1040
0:38:18,929 --> 0:38:21,132
Come on.


1041
0:38:21,132 --> 0:38:23,34
I see one important
thing that's been left.


1042
0:38:23,34 --> 0:38:24,302
Somebody please.


1043
0:38:24,302 --> 0:38:28,72
No, what's up
there that I want?


1044
0:38:28,72 --> 0:38:30,341
Grab the potty.


1045
0:38:30,341 --> 0:38:32,43

drill, you know?


1050

Don't cross me!


1051
0:38:38,349 --> 0:38:40,384
Who said they
grabbed the cooler?


1052
0:38:40,384 --> 0:38:41,485
Michael: We already
have the other cooler.


1053
0:38:41,485 --> 0:38:43,2

not taking this one?


1054
0:38:43,2 --> 0:38:43,954

guess we can.

I won't be
caught off guard.


1058

I'm obsessed with being in
control of the situation


1059

and having an answer
for it and having the

resources in which
to draw upon to take


1061

0:40:37,735 --> 0:40:40,137
<i> It is now an hour and
 a half since Christine</i>


1106
0:40:40,137 --> 0:40:42,106
<i> began the
 evacuation drill</i>


1107
0:40:42,106 --> 0:40:44,41
<i> and five and a
 half hours until</i>


1108
0:40:44,41 --> 0:40:49,79
<i> the hypothetical
 mega-tsunami strikes.</i>


1109
0:40:49,79 --> 0:40:51,816
Chuck Connolly: Christine,
if I were you I would go


1110
0:40:51,816 --> 0:40:53,717
ahead and get those two
girls and the dog in one


1111
0:40:53,717 --> 0:40:57,721
raft and go ahead
and get on the water.


1112
0:40:57,721 --> 0:40:59,99
You have to practice
a lot before you


1113
0:40:59,99 --> 0:41:1,892
pursue any of
these things.


1114
0:41:1,892 --> 0:41:3,828
If you've never
blown up your rafts,


1115
0:41:3,828 --> 0:41:5,129
if you've never
put them together,


1116
0:41:5,129 --> 0:41:6,831
if you've never
paddled them, uh,


1117
0:41:6,831 --> 0:41:8,265
I think your
likelihood of survival


1118
0:41:8,265 --> 0:41:22,12
goes down a lot.


1119
0:41:22,12 --> 0:41:26,784
Daughter: Mom!


1120
0:41:26,784 --> 0:41:28,486
Michael: Very
good, Mom.


1121
0:41:28,486 --> 0:41:29,854
August!


1122
0:41:29,854 --> 0:41:31,956
Come on pup!


1123
0:41:31,956 --> 0:41:33,57
Let's go.


1124
0:41:33,57 --> 0:41:36,66
Let's go, let's
go, let's go!


1125
0:41:36,66 --> 0:41:37,461
I know you're tired.


1126
0:41:37,461 --> 0:41:39,63
Let's go!


1127
0:41:39,63 --> 0:41:41,165
<i> Narrator: By the time
 they're on the water with</i>


1128
0:41:41,165 --> 0:41:43,367
<i> all their preps,
 two hours have</i>


1129
0:41:43,367 --> 0:41:45,736
<i> passed since the
 drill began.</i>


1130
0:41:45,736 --> 0:41:46,704
Chuck Connolly: So now
we gotta figure out


1131
0:41:46,704 --> 0:41:48,372
if we can paddle
these things, right?


1132
0:41:48,372 --> 0:41:50,374
<i> Narrator: And according
 to Chuck's GPS,</i>


1133
0:41:50,374 --> 0:41:52,576
<i> Christine and her
 family aren't paddling</i>


1134
0:41:52,576 --> 0:41:56,213
<i> faster than 1.2
 miles per hour.</i>


1135
0:41:56,213 --> 0:41:59,617
<i> At this rate, the deadly
 tsunami Christine fears</i>


1136
0:41:59,617 --> 0:42:2,353
<i> would hit Virginia before
 she and her family could</i>


1137
0:42:2,353 --> 0:42:6,257
<i> paddle to their safe
 house on high ground.</i>


1138
0:42:6,257 --> 0:42:8,25
Chuck Connolly: Okay,
let's call time here


1139
0:42:8,25 --> 0:42:9,56
with the flood coming.


1140
0:42:9,56 --> 0:42:11,95
You got everything loaded.


1141
0:42:11,95 --> 0:42:13,597
But you guys are now being
swept down this waterway.


1142
0:42:13,597 --> 0:42:15,766
So what could we
have left behind?


1143
0:42:15,766 --> 0:42:16,767
Family: The dog.


1144
0:42:16,767 --> 0:42:17,768
Chuck Connolly: The dog.


1145
0:42:17,768 --> 0:42:18,903
The dog probably
would have chased,


1146
0:42:18,903 --> 0:42:20,471
eventually, would have
come into the water.


1147
0:42:20,471 --> 0:42:21,672
You had probably a
fairly good chance of


1148
0:42:21,672 --> 0:42:22,873
hooking up with
him later.


1149
0:42:22,873 --> 0:42:24,909
Don't get me wrong,
I love my dogs but


1150
0:42:24,909 --> 0:42:26,21
when it comes
to doomsday,


1151
0:42:26,21 --> 0:42:28,879
they're gonna have to
fend for themselves.


1152
0:42:28,879 --> 0:42:30,281
<i> Narrator: Having
 watched them struggle</i>


1153
0:42:30,281 --> 0:42:32,917
<i> to load all their preps,
 Chuck thinks Christine</i>


1154
0:42:32,917 --> 0:42:36,353
<i> and her family need to
 reevaluate their plan.</i>


1155
0:42:36,353 --> 0:42:37,655
Chuck Connolly: Okay,
so I saw lots of things


1156
0:42:37,655 --> 0:42:38,822
but I guess
what's important


1157
0:42:38,822 --> 0:42:40,157
is what did you
get out of this?


1158
0:42:40,157 --> 0:42:41,492
Any changes
need to be made?


1159
0:42:41,492 --> 0:42:42,326
Christine: Absolutely.


1160
0:42:42,326 --> 0:42:43,527
Randy: Oh sure,
less load.


1161
0:42:43,527 --> 0:42:44,929
Chuck Connolly: When I
look at these boats,


1162
0:42:44,929 --> 0:42:45,93
if one of them
had flipped,


1163
0:42:45,93 --> 0:42:46,997
how much of the
stuff would have


1164
0:42:46,997 --> 0:42:47,932
stayed attached?


1165
0:42:47,932 --> 0:42:48,799
Michael: Nothing.


1166
0:42:48,799 --> 0:42:49,733
Nothing at all.


1167
0:42:49,733 --> 0:42:50,768
Chuck Connolly: Okay.


1168
0:42:50,768 --> 0:42:51,835
Christine: Aww, that's
what you're talkin'.


1169
0:42:51,835 --> 0:42:52,836
Randy: But under
the gun, you know.


1170
0:42:52,836 --> 0:42:54,905
Chuck Connolly: Their
priorities aren't


1171
0:42:54,905 --> 0:42:56,73
really where
they need to be.


1172
0:42:56,73 --> 0:42:58,475
I kept hearing the
word essentials and


1173
0:42:58,475 --> 0:43:0,344
I was seeing things
I didn't think were


1174
0:43:0,344 --> 0:43:2,146
quite essentials
here and there.


1175
0:43:2,146 --> 0:43:3,514
I guess the most
glaring one that jumped


1176
0:43:3,514 --> 0:43:6,183
out was the
paper towels.


1177
0:43:6,183 --> 0:43:7,318
Christine:
Toilet paper!


1178
0:43:7,318 --> 0:43:8,686
Randy: Yeah, but
we've got three girls.


1179
0:43:8,686 --> 0:43:9,82
Michael: Hey man,
we got three girls,


1180
0:43:9,82 --> 0:43:10,888
come on man.


1181
0:43:10,888 --> 0:43:12,389
Chuck Connolly: The giant
package of toilet paper.


1182
0:43:12,389 --> 0:43:13,857
That was pretty worthless.


1183
0:43:13,857 --> 0:43:16,493
It took up a lot of room
and it wasn't packaged,


1184
0:43:16,493 --> 0:43:17,528
it wasn't sealed.


1185
0:43:17,528 --> 0:43:19,63
It was just ready
to get wet and


1186
0:43:19,63 --> 0:43:22,32
be a bunch of garbage.


1187
0:43:22,32 --> 0:43:23,67
Christine: I
gotta tell you,


1188
0:43:23,67 --> 0:43:25,169
my own performance,
I'm not too impressed.


1189
0:43:25,169 --> 0:43:26,17
We were slow.


1190
0:43:26,17 --> 0:43:28,172
I'm, I'm not confident
in our speed at all.


1191
0:43:28,172 --> 0:43:29,34
It's something
that definitely


1192
0:43:29,34 --> 0:43:30,307
has to be worked on.


1193
0:43:30,307 --> 0:43:32,42
This just really makes
me rethink Plan B.


1194
0:43:32,42 --> 0:43:33,43
I think we're
gonna have to make


1195
0:43:33,43 --> 0:43:38,182
some adjustments in it.


1196
0:43:38,182 --> 0:43:39,95
<i> Narrator: Christine,
 you have a substantial</i>


1197
0:43:39,95 --> 0:43:42,119
<i> amount of food
 and water stored.</i>


1198
0:43:42,119 --> 0:43:44,822
<i> However, in the event
 that you have to bug out,</i>


1199
0:43:44,822 --> 0:43:47,91
<i> you'll need to bring it
 all with you or risk</i>


1200
0:43:47,91 --> 0:43:48,392
<i> leaving yourself
 vulnerable to</i>


1201
0:43:48,392 --> 0:43:50,227
<i> thirst and dehydration.</i>


1202
0:43:50,227 --> 0:43:52,229
<i> Rather than attempt to
 travel with everything</i>


1203
0:43:52,229 --> 0:43:54,632
<i> you might need, you
 should invest more time</i>


1204
0:43:54,632 --> 0:43:57,401
<i> establishing preps at
 your bug out location.</i>


1205
0:43:57,401 --> 0:43:58,769
Christine: I agree
with the assessment.


1206
0:43:58,769 --> 0:44:0,37
I see where some
improvements need


1207
0:44:0,37 --> 0:44:1,605
to be made and
that's where we're


1208
0:44:1,605 --> 0:44:3,307
gonna begin tomorrow.


1209
0:44:3,307 --> 0:44:4,608

better get busy.

0:44:51,388 --> 0:44:54,992
There's work to do.
