###13 ALEX OLSON: I read some stupid thing in some skateboarder
###16 magazine that was like back in the day you didn't have to--
###20 you'd never sponsor me tapes.
###23 You'd go and skate somewhere, and people, if they thought
###24 you were good you'd get sponsored, and I
###27 thought that was rad.
###29 I thought that was the way to go.
###30 I probably shouldn't have done that.
###33 But I guess it worked out.
###35 [LAUGHTER]
###36 ALEX OLSON: Sorry, I was just thinking
###37 of something retarded.
###37 OK, what?
###39 PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, welcome back to the
###40 Epicly Later'd Show.
###42 This episode is about Alex Olson, who I've known for a
###44 really long time.
###45 And I've seen him change from being this little kid, to
###50 being this really awesome grown-up skater.
###56 He's like the kind of pros they used to have in the '80s,
###59 where it was just pure skill and not much hype about how
###64 they dressed or anything.
###65 He looks like he was just made to skate.
###69 Alex right now is filming for the Lakai
###70 video, which is probably--
###72 it's definitely one of the most
###73 anticipated videos in years.
###76 And Alex is going to have his first part in that.
###78 He's never had a real part in a real skate video.
###80 And so that's a lot of pressure.
###81 And right now he's filming to be in this video with Koston
###85 and Guy Mariano, which is a huge thing to live up to.
###88 Do you feel a lot of pressure for the Lakai video?
###92 ALEX OLSON: It's coming on slowly.
###94 It's coming on.
###96 It's stressful.
###98 There's so much riding on the video.
###100 It's kind of making me nervous.
###102 I've stressed out so much already.
###105 -When's it due?
###106 ALEX OLSON: I've shed tears, all right?
###108 I have.
###110 You know what?
###111 Honestly, there's too much riding on this video.
###114 And people have such high expectations for it, that
###116 people are expecting so much that they're
###120 going to be let down.
###121 TY EVANS: I don't think he likes filming.
###123 I don't think anyone likes filming for that matter, but I
###126 was like this spot's sick, right?
###127 And he was like fucking sucks.
###130 All right rad.
###131 Maybe that's his way of saying he likes it.
###133 He's always pissed at something, mad at something,
###135 something sucks.
###137 Sports sucks.
###139 The spot sucks.
###141 MARC JOHNSON: I think he just sort of does his own thing in
###144 his own time.
###144 And when one thing about Alex, I don't think he's impressed
###147 by very much.
###148 Kind of puts you off when you do a really rad trick
###150 and he's just like.
###152 
###155 Naw, I'm just kidding.
###157 AARON MEZA: For sure, Alex got on Girl, and he was probably
###159 the least enthusiastic about it out of anybody in the
###163 history of the company.
###165 Right.
###166 Completely unimpressed with the phone call, like hey
###168 you're getting on Girl.
###169 Now they called to shoot an ad.
###170 We wanted to do a certain ad, and he didn't want to do it.
###174 And because of that--
###175 -Fucking lame.
###176 AARON MEZA: Because of that he was like, can I just ride for
###177 chocolate instead?
###179 This is Carroll junior.
###181 This is Mike Carroll's revenge.
###184 He has to deal with somebody now that he was
###187 like at that age.
###189 MIKE CARROLL: I'm curious if I was that bad, but I can see to
###194 a certain sense that he's doing the same shit that I've
###197 done to annoy people.
###201 I don't think he'll ever wear a Girl shirt.
###203 He'll make sure he'll wear a fucking Jason Jesse shirt, or
###209 something else.
###210 -You should put on a Girl skateboard shirt.
###213 ALEX OLSON: No, I'll put a Quicksilver shirt on.
###214 How about that?
###215 Yeah, I should but whatever I don't.
###218 
###228 -He was the last probably, the first person in a long time to
###230 get on Girl.
###232 Just as dude hanging out that was a friend, that just
###236 eventually got on the team.
###238 It was old style like this dude's sick, he's our friend.
###241 Like, let's hook him up.
###242 Even though everybody already knew who he
###243 was already in skating.
###245 ALEX OLSON: Well Supreme opened up, when I was in LA,
###248 and they had a bowl to skate in there.
###252 So all these pros would come in there, and I go skate the
###255 bowl with them, and I met like all the Girl guys from that.
###260 MIKE CARROLL: We were just skating with him a lot.
###261 When we first started skating with him, we didn't think that
###264 he was actually trying to be a sponsor guy.
###265 He was just skating around being just a kid, going around
###270 skating with people.
###271 I think there's a lot of the same skater.
###273 And I feel like he's a different type of skater.
###276 It just seemed like a natural thing that he should be on.
###279 
###282 -Glory days.
###284 1994.
###285 This is Mike Carroll's skater of the year trophy.
###287 
###292 Parking block.
###293 Never figured that out. until about three months ago.
###297 -Hey Alex, you can't listen right now.
###298 ALEX OLSON: OK.
###299 -Leave.
###301 I think for him it might be weird, because he looks the
###304 best just in real life.
###306 Like someone like Dennis Busenitz, or Julian.
###308 In real life they look good on video, but if you're lucky
###313 enough to see Julian skate in real life, it's way different.
###319 -Dude is ripping like a seasoned pro.
###323 He's a young dude but really old, like up here.
###326 I'm glad that in this day and age there are
###329 still people like Alex.
###330 skating.
###332 He just defies all categories.
###335 You've got this kind of group, and this kind of group, and
###337 this kind of--
###338 Alex is way over here.
###342 -In a lot of ways, he's kind of like an old soul.
###344 Like, especially about skating, with Steve his dad,
###347 being a pro skater from the '70s.
###349 He had some serious early--
###352 he probably got steered a good direction really fast.
###356 There's something in the blood I guess.
###357 
###376 -Standard issue.
###378 Welcome to California.
###378 That's what they said.
###380 Welcome to California.
###383 You're not really causing damage.
###385 It's a piece of metal, and you're on your board on the
###389 metal, too.
###390 It's like the best was, yeah, we didn't
###393 know you could skate.
###393 No, man, I know that you know that you're not allowed to.
###396 No, dude.
###397 It's my first time here.
###398 There's no signs anywhere.
###399 Well there was a sign here, but still, you play dumb.
###403 How many times has that happened?
###405 Thousands.
###406 Million Fuck.
###410 Billions.
###412 It's the same song and dance no matter where you are.
###416 
###419 
###430 STEVE OLSON: Come in.
###431 -We went over to Alex's to interview his dad Steve Olson,
###434 who is a pro skater from the '70s.
###437 I believe Steve did mostly slalom and downhill.
###440 But he skates pools, vert, straight.
###443 And he still skates now.
###445 
###452 STEVE OLSON: That's a picture of Alex when he was seven.
###456 You should do a show on him.
###458 -I want to.
###460 STEVE OLSON: Oh yeah, right.
###463 -You guys both said that.
###464 STEVE OLSON: [LAUGHTER]
###465 Imagine that.
###467 Why would we do one together?
###468 
###470 STEVE OLSON: Him and I together?
###472 Are you kidding me?
###475 -So Alex finally said that we can interview
###480 him and his dad together.
###481 We spent most of the day sitting around waiting for
###484 Steve to show up.
###485 Then finally he showed up.
###488 And I sat them down together, and got an interview.
###491 STEVE OLSON: Alex started skating basically around this
###495 little square at my mom and dad's house.
###499 -How old was he?
###501 STEVE OLSON: Three.
###502 ALEX OLSON: You're an idiot.
###503 I was not three, or four, or five.
###505 STEVE OLSON: How old were you?
###506 Two?
###506 ALEX OLSON: Seven or eight.
###508 STEVE OLSON: Bullshit.
###510 Oh my God.
###511 This is the worst thing I've ever done in my life.
###515 What's this for anyway?
###517 -Don't worry about it.
###518 -A skate show.
###519 STEVE OLSON: Skate show?
###520 Like skate TV?
###522 -Have you seen it?
###523 STEVE OLSON: No.
###524 -Would you say Alex is more responsible than you?
###527 STEVE OLSON: Totally.
###529 Oh, you act like you're 20.
###530 No, I'm 45.
###532 I act 45.
###534 ALEX OLSON: You definitely don't act like you're 45.
###536 STEVE OLSON: Where are the rules and regulations how old
###539 you have to act?
###540 ALEX OLSON: There are no rules or regulations.
###541 It's just people that are your age act differently than--
###546 STEVE OLSON: How I act.
###547 ALEX OLSON: Yes.
###548 Exactly.
###549 STEVE OLSON: So that means what?
###554 Who give me the most shit in my life?
###555 My son.
###558 -He's like your new mom?
###560 STEVE OLSON: No.
###561 
###563 I can't get milk out of his [INAUDIBLE].
###566 
###570 And those cans that you brought back?
###573 Suck.
###573 ALEX OLSON: Well guess what?
###575 Fuck you.
###575 STEVE OLSON: Yes.
###577 
###579 ALEX OLSON: I live with my dad now.
###581 And now his girlfriend moved in.
###584 With her dog.
###585 And you saw how big the place was.
###588 It's fucked.
###589 I hate it.
###590 -What?
###591 ALEX OLSON: I don't know It's just bad.
###593 Well there's like that weird couch, bed thing that--
###598 -Over by the motorcycle?
###598 ALEX OLSON: So he'll just switch off.
###601 I don't know.
###603 I need to get my own place.
###606 I need to find a rich girlfriend and
###607 just stay at her place.
###608 -What is that like going and having a
###610 drink with your father?
###611 ALEX OLSON: It's embarrassing because you try to
###613 pawn me off to girls.
###614 
###617 STEVE OLSON: What are you talking about?
###619 ALEX OLSON: I just told you.
###623 STEVE OLSON: I try to pawn you off onto chicks?
###625 ALEX OLSON: Yeah.
###627 STEVE OLSON: This is my son.
###628 You guys should hook up.
###629 ALEX OLSON: Yup.
###631 -Did you home school Alex?
###633 STEVE OLSON: No, I un-schooled Alex.
###637 Don't ever touch my finger again.
###639 -I thought you home schooled.
###641 STEVE OLSON: I pulled him out of school to un-school him,
###643 and take him out of the trap.
###645 -And how did--
###646 STEVE OLSON: the trap.
###647 -Did you teach him how to read?
###650 STEVE OLSON: No, I taught him how to make himself
###652 learn how to read.
###655 -Alex, how did that work being home schooled?
###660 STEVE OLSON: No, no, no.
###660 It's called un-schooled.
###663 ALEX OLSON: Shut up for once.
###664 STEVE OLSON: Dude, what are you talking about?
###665 That's what it was called.
###666 ALEX OLSON: It was called un-school?
###667 STEVE OLSON: Do you want me to show you the fucking thing?
###668 ALEX OLSON: Yeah, I would love to see it.
###669 STEVE OLSON: It was called un-schooling.
###670 There's all sorts of different programs for it.
###672 ALEX OLSON: Let's see it big mouth.
###673 STEVE OLSON: We'll have to go online.
###674 ALEX OLSON: All right.
###675 STEVE OLSON: Too bad the internet's down right now.
###677 ALEX OLSON: Exactly.
###678 That's bullshit.
###678 There's no such thing.
###680 STEVE OLSON: Are you crazed?
###682 ALEX OLSON: What?
###683 -He said it runs in the family.
###685 STEVE OLSON: I never focused my skateboard
###687 in my entire life.
###688 ALEX OLSON: That doesn't mean you don't have a bad temper.
###690 STEVE OLSON: I don't have a bad temper.
###691 ALEX OLSON: Yes you do.
###692 STEVE OLSON: Oh my god.
###693 How do I have a bad temper?
###695 ALEX OLSON: I've seen it.
###695 Don't try to cover that up.
###696 You have a bad temper.
###699 STEVE OLSON: Well when I'm pushed to the edge.
###701 ALEX OLSON: You have a bad temper.
###702 We all have bad tempers.
###703 STEVE OLSON: Don't push me to [INAUDIBLE].
###706 [LAUGHTER]
###709 What is the next question?
###713 -I just like watching you guys riff.
###715 Big happy family together.
###718 STEVE OLSON: You want to see him snap?
###720 Or not?
###722 Do you want to see your guy, the subject matter, snap?
###729 That's not nice.
###732 -I'm not making him snap.
###733 STEVE OLSON: I would never make him snap.
###735 I could just say one thing and he'll snap.
###737 ALEX OLSON: What is that?
###738 STEVE OLSON: I'm God.
###740 [LAUGHTER]
###742 ALEX OLSON: Come on.
###743 
###747 STEVE OLSON: I can't help it.
###749 I really dig my son.
###751 Whatever he says, you never take away how much I dig him.
###755 Understand that?
###756 All you other fucking parents out there should
###757 maybe take this lead.
###759 Fucking roll with it.
###761 You're an idiot, dad.
###763
