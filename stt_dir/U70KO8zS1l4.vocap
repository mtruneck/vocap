###8 PATRICK O'DELL: Oh, what's this photo?
###9 JAMES KELCH: Oh, damn.
###10 That's 1987.
###13 Backside smith stall.
###16 Could be '88, it's probably '88.
###18 But anyway, it's a backside smith stall in the big block
###21 at Embarcadero.
###21 PATRICK O'DELL: With sweatpants?
###22 JAMES KELCH: Yeah, sweatpants and a generic indie shirt my
###25 mom got at the flea market, And that one is 1986 with the
###31 SMA shirt, olleying a bum that's sleeping on the way.
###34 PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, what's up?
###35 Welcome back to the Epicly Later'd show.
###37 This episode is about James Kelch.
###41 When I first moved to San Francisco and I wanted to be a
###43 skate photographer, he was probably the first pro that I
###46 got to shoot pictures with.
###48 James Kelch in the early '90s was known as the Mayor of EMB.
###52 People always have stories about people being jerks down
###55 at EMB, but James being really cool.
###58 But he did definitely run some scams.
###60 We asked James some questions, and then I'll run it by Maza
###65 or Mike Carroll and they'll say that what he's
###67 saying's not true.
###68 But then there were some things he told me that I
###70 didn't think were true, and then they were true.
###74 I don't know, I think he's just a really good storyteller
###76 and he likes to embellish a little bit maybe.
###79 People talk about James like he's a super amazing skater.
###82 So in the course of making this episode, Maza sent us
###85 lost Kelch tapes that I think are really awesome and really
###88 show why he was pro.
###92 And here it is, James Kelch episode.
###94 
###96 How long did you live in Ohio for?
###99 JAMES KELCH: Before I went to San Francisco?
###101 Hardly at all.
###102 I was born here and we were in a military family, we moved
###104 around a lot.
###105 So hardly at all, ever.
###107 Just come to visit and stuff like that.
###109 I moved to San Francisco from Shreveport, Louisiana.
###112 PATRICK O'DELL: You went to high school in San Francisco?
###114 JAMES KELCH: Yeah, I went to middle school and high school.
###116 Trail Hill Middle School, Galileo High School.
###119 PATRICK O'DELL: Galileo, the one in--
###121 JAMES KELCH: OJ went to school.
###122 It's on Van Ness down by the wharf.
###126 It's a pretty gnarly, rugged school, man.
###128 Sure changed the way I look at stuff.
###129 PATRICK O'DELL: Then how'd you start skating?
###131 JAMES KELCH: I lived on [INAUDIBLE]
###133 Island and I was just cruising around on my bike one day and
###135 I seen this kid skating down in one of the little squares.
###139 I don't know what they're called, cul-de-sacs or
###140 something like that?
###142 Just some kid back there skating.
###143 He did a little bonus off a bumper of a car, all these
###145 people were around all fired up.
###147 And I was like wow, that's dope.
###148 PATRICK O'DELL: Do when'd you first go to EMB?
###149 JAMES KELCH: I went to EMB the first time around in the
###152 middle of '85 or so.
###154 I took the bus into the city, got off just to skate around,
###157 first time skating in the city.
###158 And I asked some random kid with a skateboard, where do
###160 people skate?
###160 And he's like, well, there's this plaza down the street.
###162 I see skaters there every once in a while.
###163 I just skated down there and never left.
###166 PATRICK O'DELL: So it wasn't a spot that people skated
###168 regularly then?
###169 JAMES KELCH: Not at all.
###171 I'd go there all the time, there'd be no one
###172 ever, all day long.
###174 Me and someone I might have come with.
###176 And then randomly though, you'd see maybe Tommy or
###178 someone would skate through, do a few tricks and leave.
###180 But mostly you would see Ken McGuire doing hand plants.
###183 
###185 I used to get heckled for sitting down
###187 there all the time.
###188 I used to tell them I wasn't a real skater.
###190 Until I'd blow their spots and show them that if you learn to
###193 skate one place, you can skate anywhere, you dummies.
###196 SAM SMYTH: Back then if I'm 11-years-old, this is '87.
###201 If you skated in '87 and you bumped into a kid in San
###204 Francisco, told him you skated, he'd ask you how high
###207 could you ollie.
###207 If you could ollie the highest, then you was the best
###209 skater out there.
###210 And Kelch, for sure, could ollie the highest in
###213 Embarcadero.
###214 
###229 AARON MEZA: At the time I'd been going to Embarcadero for
###232 a long time just randomly.
###234 Because I lived just outside SF.
###237 And he's somebody I seen there throughout the years.
###240 One day I was just filming my friend and he was like hey, do
###244 you want to film some stuff?
###245 And we filmed a couple lines of lines
###246 and a couple of tricks.
###247 So I would just go film with him and that dude Jake Vogel.
###251 He was trying to get on one-on-one with Jake.
###252 We'd come this one line, like he seriously skated the whole
###255 place, it was super sick.
###256 
###279 He had been sponsored, but I think Dogtown might have went
###281 out of business.
###282 Maybe a week later, it was funny, he was like there's
###286 this company, all these dudes are going to quit H-Street,
###288 Mike Churnowski's leaving.
###290 It's going to be called--
###291 I don't know if he knew the name.
###292 I guess he knew the name.
###293 It was going to be called Plan B.
###294 He named off all the dudes, he was like it's going to be
###297 Carroll, Hensley, Sheffy, Rick Howard, Danny Way.
###301 He's like they maybe want me to be the
###302 AN like Jason Carney.
###304 I remember that was another AN.
###306 He might have said Eric Coston, too, but he definitely
###308 said Jason Carney.
###310 Was going to be the AN with him.
###312 So that's what we were filming for, his Plan B sponsor video.
###315 But then I think later I got to know Mike and he was more
###317 like yeah, I think it was just me being like yeah, you should
###321 try to get on.
###322 And at that time, I was like James was so good, it made
###325 sense to me.
###326 I was like that's sick, dude, that'd be so rad.
###328 PATRICK O'DELL: Did the footage you filmed with James,
###330 the early footage, end up anywhere?
###331 AARON MEZA: No, none of it.
###332 
###337 -You know, he was a little bit older, he could fight, he can
###340 hook up with chicks.
###342 So he was like a cool dude to all those dudes, so they all
###345 looked up to him.
###346 As many people like maybe he was mean to, which I don't
###349 think was that many, he probably would be the one dude
###351 who would say hi to a random guy out of town, you know?
###355 SAM SMYTH: People came to him because they knew he was going
###358 to be the bodyguard, the big brother, just the whole
###364 Embarcadero regulator.
###367 I can remember something going down.
###370 My buddy was trying to sell some weed, got
###374 punched in the face.
###375 And I ran to get James like I was getting the fucking
###379 cavalry, you know?
###380 
###393 PATRICK O'DELL: Tell me about stealing boards.
###395 I've heard rumors of that.
###396 JAMES KELCH: If you came through and it was one of them
###398 hectic winters and no one had a new board.
###400 And you had all brand new shit, and you just got out of
###402 your mom's Lexus or whatnot.
###403 Yeah, you're probably going to get your board stolen.
###405 It's the same as if you wear a big ass huge gold chain and go
###407 hang out in Oakland real quick.
###408 I mean nothing's different.
###410 Everyone thinks oh, just because they were skaters.
###411 We were still just city kids.
###413 But it wasn't an everyday crazy out of hand, you go
###416 there, you get your board stolen.
###418 It gets exaggerated way out of hand.
###419 SAM SMYTH: I mean, he's always been that personality, man.
###423 Cool as the Fonz, young Burt Reynolds face.
###428 He always had that charisma, ever since he was young.
###433 I guess when you got it, you got it.
###435 -This is James' car.
###436 
###441 Here goes the front panel.
###442 
###445 Let me see what I can do with this wheel here.
###448 Hey, let's see if we can start it!
###449 Look out, everybody, it might blow up!
###450 
###453 -What's the scene with this car?
###454 Why's it all fucked up, dude?
###456 -Because fucking dumb ass Billy took it and ruined it,
###458 and him and Jeff and Dune.
###460 
###464 JAMES KELCH: Come on, P. Out of the way,
###468 Gotto, we got company.
###470 
###473 [INAUDIBLE]
###473 blah, blah, blah, I swear I seen it just lying right here.
###477 Yeah, film the whole shit.
###479 This is the real life, no Ferraris, no
###483 motorcycles, no nothing.
###487 PATRICK O'DELL: So when this video came out, what year was
###490 this video made?
###491 JAMES KELCH: The video came out in '93.
###493 PATRICK O'DELL: When the real video was made you were
###495 already pro?
###496 JAMES KELCH: Yeah.
###497 PATRICK O'DELL: How did you first get on Real?
###499 JAMES KELCH: I had knew Jim Thebo and he was giving me
###500 wheels every once in awhile.
###502 And then one day I seen him and Givanti and a bunch of
###509 heads skating brown model benches.
###511 I just started skating the benches like a maniac, man,
###513 just trying to show off.
###514 And then Thebo called me that night and was like look, I
###516 can't do pressure flips.
###517 And it was a joke, of course.
###518 And I was like, yeah, me neither, really.
###519 And he was like well, we need a new pro.
###520 You want to skate for us?
###521 And I was like, yes, of course.
###522 PATRICK O'DELL: So he just saw you skate one time?
###523 JAMES KELCH: Oh, no.
###524 He had seen me skate a million times, but I hadn't seen him
###527 in a while.
###528 I was AN for other companies before I got on Real.
###531 Like Dogtown, H-Street, 101 for a little bit, rode for
###535 Plan B for a little while.
###537 I watched this video the other day.
###538 It's pretty gnarly that we even put a
###540 video out like that.
###541 Yeah, that's that girl, Molly.
###542 
###545 Every time I [INAUDIBLE], she always something to say.
###547 That bitch, blah, blah, blah.
###550 PATRICK O'DELL: They're doing the wave?
###552 JAMES KELCH: Yeah, they were doing the wave.
###555 I'm a gymnast.
###556 Ollie [INAUDIBLE] flip, the only time I ever did it
###558 outside of a skate park, I had no wheels.
###560 I was just rolling on bearings right there.
###564 I was actually really proud of that [INAUDIBLE].
###567 It always used to feel real good.
###569 I was actually pleased I even worked a part out.
###571 I wasn't even barely skating when we filmed all this shit.
###573 When they came to me and were like oh, the video's done, I
###575 was like but hold on, I didn't even film.
###576 PATRICK O'DELL: You weren't skating a
###577 lot because of drugs?
###578 JAMES KELCH: Actually, no.
###580 It was mostly injuries at first.
###581 And then the drugs came with me just sitting around doing
###584 nothing because of my ankles.
###585 Because I had childhood arthritis growing up,
###587 rheumatoid arthritis.
###588 And so I got all these crushed-up, clicking bones and
###591 all this bullshit, and I just would go around it.
###593 And then it started getting worse and worse until
###595 eventually I was just, I'm not even going to
###596 try to skate anymore.
###598 But then I was still pro, and doing drugs, trying to skate
###601 here and there.
###602 Dude, I would be just standing there all drugged out and Jim
###604 would just be like do something.
###605 I'd be like just tell me what to do, man.
###607 They he would just bring up a random trick he
###609 saw me do one time.
###610 I'd be like all right.
###610 PATRICK O'DELL: Who filmed it, Maza?
###611 JAMES KELCH: Most of the real video was filmed by, I would
###614 go with Thebo.
###616 Because he knew if it wasn't him, that I
###617 wouldn't even come out.
###618 Like, all those other dudes would show up to get me and I
###620 wouldn't even go outside.
###620 I'd be like, well, fuck off.
###621 But then Jim would come and I'd have to get up.
###624 I'd be like all right, Jim, let's go.
###625 He'd put me the shower and said come on.
###629 It's very, very weird when I watch it.
###631 A lot of those tricks, toes are
###633 dragging, no one's rolling.
###635 You might as well just stop and pick your
###636 board up and walk away.
###638 Except for Solomon's part.
###639 All I know is I was chilling on Oak Street one day at the
###641 party palace.
###642 And there's a knock at the door like 7:00 in the morning.
###643 I open it, it's like Gonzo.
###645 He's like dude, I just saw your part, I love it.
###647 It's one of my favorites.
###648 You want to go skate?
###650 I was like oh, I didn't go to sleep all night and I kind of
###652 just shut the door in his face.
###653 PATRICK O'DELL: On Gonz?
###654 JAMES KELCH: Yeah, I just went back in the house.
###656 I was too embarrassed to hang out with him.
###657 I was up all night doing drugs.
###659 I didn't want to hangout with Gonzo, he's like my idol.
###663 As you could tell, the house is a tad bit cluttered so it
###665 took me a while to find it.
###668 My girl put this shit together.
###669 I don't know if that plastic's going to be
###671 reflecting on you or not.
###672 This one, this is how skateboarding actually works.
###675 Whether they, not now maybe, but I know these guys always
###678 cared about me and everything, but listen to this story.
###680 It's a light brown coat, and you see all the
###682 dark spots on it?
###682 That's all blood, and spray matter, and people bleeding
###686 and shit like that.
###686 Well, I got into a big bar fight with these bikers and I
###688 just beat their faces in.
###689 They beat me up, too, as you can tell.
###691 So the next day I go down to the Deluxe to get maybe
###693 cleaned up, some money, see if my eye's all right, it's all
###695 swollen, and get some clothes or whatnot.
###697 But instead as soon as I walked in, no one cared about
###699 any of that.
###699 They were like dude, just go take pictures.
###702 I couldn't walk, nothing, I couldn't get no new clothes.
###705 They were like, you got to get photos of this shit.
###706 They just drug me out to these abandoned projects behind Real
###709 and took this photo.
###709 PATRICK O'DELL: How much longer did you write for Real
###712 after this?
###712 JAMES KELCH: After the video came out?
###714 So if the video came out '93, '94 I moved to [INAUDIBLE] and
###719 lived with Kelly Bird and Diedrich.
###720 And then we were going to go on tour, so I came to Ohio to
###724 hang out for a little bit.
###725 Went on the tour, left early, they wrecked the van.
###728 So I'm figuring right before '95 started they called me and
###731 asked me if I was skating and all that shit.
###733 And I didn't like the tone of whoever's voice
###735 I was talking to.
###735 So I told them no, I don't skate no more, I quit.
###737 PATRICK O'DELL: You were talking to Tommy?
###738 JAMES KELCH: It was Tommy, yeah.
###739 He wasn't being a dick or nothing, but I could tell he
###741 wasn't happy with me.
###742 PATRICK O'DELL: Here's a photo I took, it was really bad.
###744 Sorry.
###744 JAMES KELCH: It is the photo you took.
###746 I remember that day.
###749 Those are some tight pants on my butt, man.
###752 Gross.
###752 You should have told me.
###754 PATRICK O'DELL: No, I'm not retiring?
###756 JAMES KELCH: Yeah, this is an ad I got like a month after I
###758 told Real I was retiring.
###760 PATRICK O'DELL: Who is God?
###762 JAMES KELCH: Yeah, I got in "Big Brother" one time.
###764 It was the "Who is God" thing.
###765 They asked me a question, what do I think about God, and took
###768 a picture of me doing a smith grind.
###769 PATRICK O'DELL: What's you say?
###770 JAMES KELCH: I said, here, want me to read it?
###772 I don't even remember.
###774 "I believe in religion because I believe there's a greater
###776 force than ours.
###777 I think when people die their souls leave to some spiritual
###779 place, whether that's good or bad.
###780 I'm not religious, because the way people go about their
###782 religions is weird.
###783 I don't tend to judge others' religions,
###785 because I don't care.
###787 The world's really a better place
###788 when people are religious.
###789 It keeps a lot of people nice.
###790 It changes psychos into somewhat normal peoples.
###792 I think most of the Earth is evil, because this is Satan's
###794 land to do with as he pleases.
###796 Most good things must be somewhere else.
###798 The only way religion has affected my life is when it's
###800 helped change some of my friends into better people."
###802 And that's that.
###805 I'm going to give a Solomon secret out real quick.
###807 You know for like a year and a half, almost two years, he
###810 used to skate the other way?
###812 And then he pushed mongo.
###812 PATRICK O'DELL: What do you mean?
###813 JAMES KELCH: He skated goofy-footed
###816 and he pushed mongo.
###818 And people told him like yo, you're whack.
###820 Unless I'm just making it all up.
###822 You never know, my brain's confused.
###823 But I remember all the stories.
###824 Yeah, dude skated goofy-footed and pushed mongo, and they
###826 told him yo, you're a bum.
###828
