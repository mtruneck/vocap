1
0:0:0,967 --> 0:0:3,636
Travis Taylor: Now on
Rocket City Rednecks.


2
0:0:3,636 --> 0:0:6,605
We cook up the
weapons of the future.


3
0:0:6,605 --> 0:0:8,274
Whoa, crap!


4
0:0:8,274 --> 0:0:10,509
Turn it off, turn it off!


5
0:0:10,509 --> 0:0:13,45
But, can we create
a homemade death ray


6
0:0:13,45 --> 0:0:17,316
that kills the enemy,
without killing us?


7
0:0:17,316 --> 0:0:18,617
Michael: Cut it off,
cut it off!


8
0:0:18,617 --> 0:0:19,485
Travis Taylor:
Turn the power off.


9
0:0:19,485 --> 0:0:20,686
I'm Travis Taylor.


10
0:0:20,686 --> 0:0:22,354
I'm a rocket scientist
in the space and defense


11
0:0:22,354 --> 0:0:23,956
industry here
in my hometown of


12
0:0:23,956 --> 0:0:25,658
Huntsville, Alabama,


13
0:0:25,658 --> 0:0:27,426
where my Daddy helped
build the rockets


14
0:0:27,426 --> 0:0:28,961
that sent us to the moon.


15
0:0:28,961 --> 0:0:29,929
Daddy: Hey, have
y'all been drinking


16
0:0:29,929 --> 0:0:31,63
rocket fuel again?


17
0:0:31,63 --> 0:0:32,898
Travis Taylor:
Sometimes big science


18
0:0:32,898 --> 0:0:34,366
moves to slow for me.


19
0:0:34,366 --> 0:0:35,634
So come the weekend,


20
0:0:35,634 --> 0:0:37,703
I round up my
best friend Rog.


21
0:0:37,703 --> 0:0:38,771
Rog: Hey!


22
0:0:38,771 --> 0:0:40,873
Travis Taylor: My nephew
Michael and my buddy Pete


23
0:0:40,873 --> 0:0:42,508
to tackle important
problems with a


24
0:0:42,508 --> 0:0:45,444
little down-home ingenuity.


25
0:0:45,444 --> 0:0:49,582
Rog: Damn it, boy.


26
0:0:49,582 --> 0:0:50,916
Travis Taylor: Right on.


27
0:0:50,916 --> 0:0:53,919
Hey is there any more
beers in the cooler?


28
0:0:53,919 --> 0:0:55,87
Rog: Anybody ready?


29
0:0:55,87 --> 0:0:56,889
Travis Taylor:
Ready Rog, pull!


30
0:0:56,889 --> 0:1:0,626
<i> [shotgun fire]</i>


31
0:1:0,626 --> 0:1:1,694
Pull!


32
0:1:1,694 --> 0:1:3,662
Mankind has been using
gun-powder weapons for


33
0:1:3,662 --> 0:1:5,498
almost a thousand years.


34
0:1:5,498 --> 0:1:6,899
Michael: We tore
that up, didn't we?


35
0:1:6,899 --> 0:1:8,667
Daddy: I've got to
find some more shells.


36
0:1:8,667 --> 0:1:9,768
Travis Taylor:
The problem is,


37
0:1:9,768 --> 0:1:10,836
once you run out
of gunpowder and


38
0:1:10,836 --> 0:1:13,572
bullets all you have left
is a fancy looking club.


39
0:1:13,572 --> 0:1:16,475
All right, pull!


40
0:1:16,475 --> 0:1:18,277
I want to come up with a
weapon that doesn't use


41
0:1:18,277 --> 0:1:22,281
gunpowder or bullets,
a weapon of the future.


42
0:1:22,281 --> 0:1:25,918
<i> [shotgun fire]</i>


43
0:1:25,918 --> 0:1:27,887
Rog: Good shot, Charlie!


44
0:1:27,887 --> 0:1:30,489
Daddy:<i> [laughing].</i>


45
0:1:30,489 --> 0:1:32,57
Travis Taylor: Since
armies of the future might


46
0:1:32,57 --> 0:1:34,76
be totally reliant on
electronics and robotics,


47
0:1:34,76 --> 0:1:36,495
I want a weapon that
can help us fight off


48
0:1:36,495 --> 0:1:38,531
the rise of the machines.


49
0:1:38,531 --> 0:1:40,699
And I think the key to
doing that is to zap them


50
0:1:40,699 --> 0:1:45,504
with a big jolt of energy,
a real life death ray.


51
0:1:45,504 --> 0:1:48,674
In fact, the US military
just announced it's


52
0:1:48,674 --> 0:1:50,876
trying to build an
electric lightning gun


53
0:1:50,876 --> 0:1:54,747
to take out enemy vehicles.


54
0:1:54,747 --> 0:1:56,415
Let's go put them back
in the room, Daddy.


55
0:1:56,415 --> 0:1:57,716
Daddy: Yeah, just
put them back.


56
0:1:57,716 --> 0:1:59,185
Travis Taylor: For our
weapon of the future,


57
0:1:59,185 --> 0:2:0,553
I want to start with
something everybody


58
0:2:0,553 --> 0:2:2,454
has in their
own kitchen and


59
0:2:2,454 --> 0:2:4,957
some people have
in their garage.


60
0:2:4,957 --> 0:2:8,16
Daddy's got one over here
for heating up fish bait.


61
0:2:8,16 --> 0:2:10,196
We could probably
make an invisible


62
0:2:10,196 --> 0:2:12,398
beam gun right here.


63
0:2:12,398 --> 0:2:13,566
If we took that
screen off,


64
0:2:13,566 --> 0:2:15,734
the micro waves would
come out the door.


65
0:2:15,734 --> 0:2:17,536
Daddy: Let me see
if I got this right,


66
0:2:17,536 --> 0:2:21,54
he wants to weaponize
my microwave oven?


67
0:2:21,54 --> 0:2:23,75
If you all ain't
using my microwave


68
0:2:23,75 --> 0:2:24,176
that's for fishing.


69
0:2:24,176 --> 0:2:25,411
I have to thaw
out my fish bait;


70
0:2:25,411 --> 0:2:26,579
you see the freezer
right there.


71
0:2:26,579 --> 0:2:28,514
Travis Taylor: Ya'll
got a new one in a box.


72
0:2:28,514 --> 0:2:30,416
Daddy: Right now we're
renovating the kitchen


73
0:2:30,416 --> 0:2:33,185
and we just had a new
microwave delivered.


74
0:2:33,185 --> 0:2:35,287
If my wife finds
out that's missing,


75
0:2:35,287 --> 0:2:37,356
she is gonna flip.


76
0:2:37,356 --> 0:2:38,691
Travis Taylor: Momma's
microwave has gotta


77
0:2:38,691 --> 0:2:40,726
be twice as
powerful as Daddy's.


78
0:2:40,726 --> 0:2:43,229
It's gonna be perfect for
our making our death ray.


79
0:2:43,229 --> 0:2:44,997
Daddy: Listen, I'm
not having any part of


80
0:2:44,997 --> 0:2:46,932
going into that kitchen
and getting microwaves


81
0:2:46,932 --> 0:2:48,467
and stuff like that.


82
0:2:48,467 --> 0:2:49,969
Rog: I don't know what
Charlie's all-nervous


83
0:2:49,969 --> 0:2:52,438
about, we're just
gonna borrow it,


84
0:2:52,438 --> 0:2:56,75
we'll put it right back,
she'll never know.


85
0:2:56,75 --> 0:2:57,643
Charlie you blame
it on Travis,


86
0:2:57,643 --> 0:2:58,944
he sent me in
here to get this.


87
0:2:58,944 --> 0:2:59,845
Travis Taylor: Yeah.


88
0:2:59,845 --> 0:3:1,146
Daddy: Mmm-hmm,
blame it on Travis,


89
0:3:1,146 --> 0:3:2,314
you go in there and get
that new microwave and


90
0:3:2,314 --> 0:3:7,62
you gonna wish you hadn't.


91
0:3:7,62 --> 0:3:16,795
Rog: Dag gone it,
childproof bologna.


92
0:3:16,795 --> 0:3:18,364
Look it here.


93
0:3:18,364 --> 0:3:21,634
One Horno de Microondas.


94
0:3:21,634 --> 0:3:22,635
Travis Taylor: All right.


95
0:3:22,635 --> 0:3:23,736
Rog: Did I say that right?


96
0:3:23,736 --> 0:3:24,903
Travis Taylor: I don't
even know what that means.


97
0:3:24,903 --> 0:3:25,871
Rog: Microwave oven.


98
0:3:25,871 --> 0:3:26,805
Travis Taylor: Open
that up, Michael.


99
0:3:26,805 --> 0:3:27,773
Was Mom in there?


100
0:3:27,773 --> 0:3:29,74
Rog: No, she was gone.


101
0:3:29,74 --> 0:3:30,542
Michael: This
is brand new.


102
0:3:30,542 --> 0:3:31,577
Travis Taylor: It's
gonna look good


103
0:3:31,577 --> 0:3:33,712
in the kitchen, Daddy.


104
0:3:33,712 --> 0:3:35,514
Michael: That's
a nice microwave.


105
0:3:35,514 --> 0:3:36,348
Travis Taylor: Hey
look right here.


106
0:3:36,348 --> 0:3:37,283
Y'all watch this.


107
0:3:37,283 --> 0:3:38,951
We all know what
microwaves do to food.


108
0:3:38,951 --> 0:3:40,219
So we want to see what
they do to something


109
0:3:40,219 --> 0:3:42,388
electrical like
a light bulb.


110
0:3:42,388 --> 0:3:43,689
Michael: Of course,
it wouldn't be fun


111
0:3:43,689 --> 0:3:44,923
just to put a
light bulb inside,


112
0:3:44,923 --> 0:3:46,58
so Uncle Travis
had to toss some


113
0:3:46,58 --> 0:3:48,427
other stuff in there.


114
0:3:48,427 --> 0:3:50,29
Daddy: Everybody
tells you not to put


115
0:3:50,29 --> 0:3:51,93
metal in a microwave.


116
0:3:51,93 --> 0:3:54,266
Of course Travis
has got to try it.


117
0:3:54,266 --> 0:3:56,435
So right now he's got a
pile of metal shavings in


118
0:3:56,435 --> 0:3:59,305
there and put a charge of
my gunpowder in with it.


119
0:3:59,305 --> 0:4:3,8
Travis Taylor: Daddy
you're gonna miss it.


120
0:4:3,8 --> 0:4:5,144
Rog: Look at that light.


121
0:4:5,144 --> 0:4:6,512
Travis Taylor: That's
the metal shavings,


122
0:4:6,512 --> 0:4:7,68
it's absorbing the energy,


123
0:4:7,68 --> 0:4:8,947
acting like an antennae


124
0:4:8,947 --> 0:4:10,649
and it's killing
our light.


125
0:4:10,649 --> 0:4:12,685
Go ahead and stop it.


126
0:4:12,685 --> 0:4:14,52
So, the microwave
lit up the light bulb


127
0:4:14,52 --> 0:4:16,422
and eventually
burned it out.


128
0:4:16,422 --> 0:4:18,824
Our next step in building
a microwave weapon is to


129
0:4:18,824 --> 0:4:20,592
modify the microwave
so we'll shoot a beam


130
0:4:20,592 --> 0:4:22,294
out of the oven and then,


131
0:4:22,294 --> 0:4:25,964
light up the bulb
from a distance.


132
0:4:25,964 --> 0:4:27,466
There's a reason why
your microwave oven


133
0:4:27,466 --> 0:4:29,668
can cook your food
without cooking you.


134
0:4:29,668 --> 0:4:31,337
Have you ever noticed
that screen you see


135
0:4:31,337 --> 0:4:32,871
when you look
through the glass,


136
0:4:32,871 --> 0:4:35,407
that's what's known
as a Faraday cage.


137
0:4:35,407 --> 0:4:37,409
It's a metal mesh that
conducts electromagnetic


138
0:4:37,409 --> 0:4:40,512
energy and keeps the
radiation inside the oven,


139
0:4:40,512 --> 0:4:43,15
but if we want to turn our
microwave into a weapon,


140
0:4:43,15 --> 0:4:45,117
that radiation is
gonna need to get out.


141
0:4:45,117 --> 0:4:46,385
Cut it.


142
0:4:46,385 --> 0:4:47,986
Cut me a 5-inch
square hole out in


143
0:4:47,986 --> 0:4:50,656
the middle of it somewhere.


144
0:4:50,656 --> 0:4:52,725
So I had Rog cut a
hole into that screen


145
0:4:52,725 --> 0:4:56,61
on the front door.


146
0:4:56,61 --> 0:4:57,863
The biggest obstacle to
building a future weapon


147
0:4:57,863 --> 0:5:0,466
in our garage is that
we might get killed.


148
0:5:0,466 --> 0:5:2,167
Pete: It's got a
little bit left there.


149
0:5:2,167 --> 0:5:4,36
Travis Taylor: Micro waves
are invisible radiation


150
0:5:4,36 --> 0:5:6,572
that can cook a chicken,
so it can cook you.


151
0:5:6,572 --> 0:5:8,6
So you got to be
careful with it,


152
0:5:8,6 --> 0:5:9,842
so don't try this at home.


153
0:5:9,842 --> 0:5:11,76
This is good enough;


154
0:5:11,76 --> 0:5:12,611
let's angle out right
through yonder.


155
0:5:12,611 --> 0:5:14,179
With the Faraday cage
removed the micro waves


156
0:5:14,179 --> 0:5:15,481
are gonna bounce all
around the inside of the


157
0:5:15,481 --> 0:5:19,818
oven and then go
out the front.


158
0:5:19,818 --> 0:5:21,687
Right now we're gonna do
a test to see how much


159
0:5:21,687 --> 0:5:24,356
energy we can get from
our microwave beam.


160
0:5:24,356 --> 0:5:25,758
We're gonna see
if it'll light up a


161
0:5:25,758 --> 0:5:27,926
light bulb
from a distance.


162
0:5:27,926 --> 0:5:29,995
Michael: Microwave
radiation can kill ya,


163
0:5:29,995 --> 0:5:32,998
and if it doesn't kill ya,
it can make you sterile


164
0:5:32,998 --> 0:5:34,666
and I haven't had kids yet
like the rest of these


165
0:5:34,666 --> 0:5:37,703
guys, so I'm gonna
stay out of the way.


166
0:5:37,703 --> 0:5:39,505
Travis Taylor:
Nobody stand any,


167
0:5:39,505 --> 0:5:41,94
you know stay a cone
backwards like this.


168
0:5:41,94 --> 0:5:43,8
Rog: Yeah.


169
0:5:43,8 --> 0:5:44,51
Travis Taylor: All right
are we, we're ready?


170
0:5:44,51 --> 0:5:45,411
Turn me on, Daddy.


171
0:5:45,411 --> 0:5:46,612
Daddy: All right,
power's on.


172
0:5:46,612 --> 0:5:55,87
Travis Taylor: All right
and here we go, starting.


173
0:5:55,87 --> 0:5:57,556
I don't believe it's
getting enough out of it


174
0:5:57,556 --> 0:5:59,425
to turn the light on.


175
0:5:59,425 --> 0:6:3,328
It's too much lost inside
that cavity inside there.


176
0:6:3,328 --> 0:6:4,53
This ain't even warm;


177
0:6:4,53 --> 0:6:6,432
it means it's not
getting a whole bunch.


178
0:6:6,432 --> 0:6:9,735
Go ahead and turn
it off Daddy.


179
0:6:9,735 --> 0:6:11,87
Daddy: What was
that, that blew up?


180
0:6:11,87 --> 0:6:14,873
Travis Taylor:
The door broke.


181
0:6:14,873 --> 0:6:17,81
Pete: The glass
got too hot.


182
0:6:17,81 --> 0:6:19,11
Travis Taylor: Clearly
we're not gonna be


183
0:6:19,11 --> 0:6:20,179
able to put that thing
back together and


184
0:6:20,179 --> 0:6:24,283
give it to mom.


185
0:6:24,283 --> 0:6:25,584
If it's not lighting
this light bulb,


186
0:6:25,584 --> 0:6:28,86
it's not a whole lot of
energy getting out here.


187
0:6:28,86 --> 0:6:29,922
We need to tear
into this thing.


188
0:6:29,922 --> 0:6:30,956
Daddy: Well you
might as well,


189
0:6:30,956 --> 0:6:32,758
'cause now that
you have broken it,


190
0:6:32,758 --> 0:6:34,293
I don't think it's
a good idea to let


191
0:6:34,293 --> 0:6:36,195
your mother see it at all.


192
0:6:36,195 --> 0:6:37,296
Travis Taylor: Well
it just came out of


193
0:6:37,296 --> 0:6:38,764
the box this way,
didn't it Rog?


194
0:6:38,764 --> 0:6:40,866
Rog: Yeah, as far
as I can tell.


195
0:6:40,866 --> 0:6:42,134
Michael: Bad
shipping, wasn't it?


196
0:6:42,134 --> 0:6:43,1
Travis Taylor: Bad.


197
0:6:43,1 --> 0:6:44,69
<i> [laughing].</i>


198
0:6:44,69 --> 0:6:45,437
Travis Taylor: Man you
can't trust that anymore.


199
0:6:45,437 --> 0:6:46,638
Daddy: I'm telling you.


200
0:6:46,638 --> 0:6:48,34
Travis Taylor: Let's roll
it on back in the shop.


201
0:6:48,34 --> 0:6:49,775
We need a new plan.


202
0:6:49,775 --> 0:6:52,511
A microwave uses this
thing called a magnetron


203
0:6:52,511 --> 0:6:54,88
to produce micro waves.


204
0:6:54,88 --> 0:6:56,715
We're gonna take the
magnetron out of the


205
0:6:56,715 --> 0:6:59,885
microwave, put it in an
aluminum box and attach a


206
0:6:59,885 --> 0:7:1,587
feed horn to the front.


207
0:7:1,587 --> 0:7:3,689
That should focus the
micro waves and give us


208
0:7:3,689 --> 0:7:9,228
enough power to
fry the enemy.


209
0:7:9,228 --> 0:7:11,196
While Rog and Michael are
cutting the copper for the


210
0:7:11,196 --> 0:7:13,732
feed horn, Pete and I are
tearing the microwave


211
0:7:13,732 --> 0:7:15,534
apart to get the
magnetron out.


212
0:7:15,534 --> 0:7:17,436
There's our magnetron.


213
0:7:17,436 --> 0:7:19,137
It's got all the circuitry
to turn it on and off


214
0:7:19,137 --> 0:7:20,606
and leave it on for a
certain amounts of time and


215
0:7:20,606 --> 0:7:22,7
even adjust the power level,


216
0:7:22,7 --> 0:7:23,342
so we're gonna save all the


217
0:7:23,342 --> 0:7:24,843
circuitry and
keep it working.


218
0:7:24,843 --> 0:7:26,411
If this light
right here is on,


219
0:7:26,411 --> 0:7:28,38
it means the
microwave is running.


220
0:7:28,38 --> 0:7:31,55
Michael: Hey,
ya'll done yet?


221
0:7:31,55 --> 0:7:33,919
Do I need a washer or can
just stick it over there?


222
0:7:33,919 --> 0:7:35,387
Pete: No, Charlie's
got a washer.


223
0:7:35,387 --> 0:7:36,922
Travis Taylor: Once we got
all the stuff out of that


224
0:7:36,922 --> 0:7:38,924
microwave that we needed,
we attached the magnetron


225
0:7:38,924 --> 0:7:40,959
to the feed horn, hooked
up all the circuitry


226
0:7:40,959 --> 0:7:44,963
and put it all in
an aluminum box.


227
0:7:44,963 --> 0:7:45,931
All right let's see,


228
0:7:45,931 --> 0:7:47,165
probably about right
here but let's turn.


229
0:7:47,165 --> 0:7:48,634
Michael: Don't
point it at my junk.


230
0:7:48,634 --> 0:7:49,902
Travis Taylor: Let's turn
it like right about,


231
0:7:49,902 --> 0:7:50,869
like that, oh about there.


232
0:7:50,869 --> 0:7:52,237
All right, let's
test this thing.


233
0:7:52,237 --> 0:7:53,839
We're gonna need to keep
a real close eye on the


234
0:7:53,839 --> 0:7:55,841
micro waves coming
out of that feed horn.


235
0:7:55,841 --> 0:7:57,543
Pete, you gonna hold
the antenna over here?


236
0:7:57,543 --> 0:7:58,377
Pete: Yeah.


237
0:7:58,377 --> 0:7:59,411
Travis Taylor: Michael,


238
0:7:59,411 --> 0:8:0,412
you oughta hold
the signal meter.


239
0:8:0,412 --> 0:8:1,58
Michael: Yeah,
I'll hold this.


240
0:8:1,58 --> 0:8:2,848
Travis Taylor: That
meter is gonna tell us


241
0:8:2,848 --> 0:8:4,95
just how powerful
our new weapon is.


242
0:8:4,95 --> 0:8:6,251
Michael: All
right, we ready?


243
0:8:6,251 --> 0:8:7,719
Pete: Safety
glasses, Michael.


244
0:8:7,719 --> 0:8:8,72
Michael: Yeah,
safety glasses.


245
0:8:8,72 --> 0:8:10,22
Travis Taylor: All right,
we're ready to go.


246
0:8:10,22 --> 0:8:11,29
We're just gonna do a
quick test here to make


247
0:8:11,29 --> 0:8:12,858
sure everything is wired
up right and working.


248
0:8:12,858 --> 0:8:13,792
Hold on;


249
0:8:13,792 --> 0:8:16,662
let me turn the
microwave up.


250
0:8:16,662 --> 0:8:19,932
All right Daddy,
put that in there.


251
0:8:19,932 --> 0:8:20,799
Michael: Here we go.


252
0:8:20,799 --> 0:8:21,567
Daddy: You need
me to turn it on?


253
0:8:21,567 --> 0:8:23,368
Travis Taylor:
Turn it on.


254
0:8:23,368 --> 0:8:25,37
Ow whoa.


255
0:8:25,37 --> 0:8:26,405
Turn it off.


256
0:8:26,405 --> 0:8:27,94
Turn the power, power,
power, turn it off.


257
0:8:27,94 --> 0:8:29,74
Michael: Kill it, kill it.


258
0:8:29,74 --> 0:8:31,43
Travis Taylor: Aw crap!


259
0:8:31,43 --> 0:8:31,977
Daddy: Oh, man.


260
0:8:31,977 --> 0:8:34,112
Travis Taylor: Holy crap.


261
0:8:34,112 --> 0:8:35,48
Pete: What in the world?


262
0:8:35,48 --> 0:8:36,582
Michael: Phew smell it.


263
0:8:36,582 --> 0:8:38,25
Travis Taylor: Man, we
lost all that smoke.


264
0:8:38,25 --> 0:8:39,685
We let the
smoke out of the


265
0:8:39,685 --> 0:8:42,588
high voltage
circuit for sure.


266
0:8:42,588 --> 0:8:43,722
Holy crap.


267
0:8:43,722 --> 0:8:45,223
Pete: Man, I had
a spike right before


268
0:8:45,223 --> 0:8:46,358
that thing blew.


269
0:8:46,358 --> 0:8:47,192
Dang.


270
0:8:47,192 --> 0:8:48,293
Travis Taylor: Did you?


271
0:8:48,293 --> 0:8:49,394
Pete: Yeah it just.


272
0:8:49,394 --> 0:8:50,629
Travis Taylor: Something
happened and we got too


273
0:8:50,629 --> 0:8:52,23
much power in the
magnetron or something


274
0:8:52,23 --> 0:8:54,132
and it just flooded
out with micro waves


275
0:8:54,132 --> 0:8:55,434
and burnt out everything.


276
0:8:55,434 --> 0:8:56,702
Michael: Gollee.


277
0:8:56,702 --> 0:8:57,936
Rog: Yeah nice.


278
0:8:57,936 --> 0:8:58,837
Travis Taylor: Dang it.


279
0:8:58,837 --> 0:9:1,73
Rog: That thing is shot.


280
0:9:1,73 --> 0:9:2,608
Daddy: I'm probably
radiated over here and


281
0:9:2,608 --> 0:9:3,976
don't even know it.


282
0:9:3,976 --> 0:9:5,31
Travis Taylor: I guess
some of the microwaves


283
0:9:5,31 --> 0:9:7,579
must've back fed
through the feed horn


284
0:9:7,579 --> 0:9:9,214
and fried the circuitry.


285
0:9:9,214 --> 0:9:11,149
Man, it was
microwave suicide.


286
0:9:11,149 --> 0:9:13,18
Michael: That thing
stinks close that lid.


287
0:9:13,18 --> 0:9:15,921
Travis Taylor:
Here comes mom.


288
0:9:15,921 --> 0:9:17,122
Michael: We're busted.


289
0:9:17,122 --> 0:9:18,523
Travis Taylor: Thought she
was gonna be gone all day.


290
0:9:18,523 --> 0:9:20,58
Daddy: Yeah, what a time
for her to show up.


291
0:9:20,58 --> 0:9:21,226
Travis Taylor: Uh-oh.


292
0:9:21,226 --> 0:9:22,461
Looks like we just
might go the way of the


293
0:9:22,461 --> 0:9:24,63
microwave if Momma finds
out what we were up to.


294
0:9:24,63 --> 0:9:26,498
Momma: Hey guys,
whatcha ya'll doin'?


295
0:9:26,498 --> 0:9:27,699
Travis Taylor:
Uh, just working.


296
0:9:27,699 --> 0:9:28,7
Rog: Nothing much.


297
0:9:28,7 --> 0:9:29,935
Michael: We're just
hanging out, Grandma.


298
0:9:29,935 --> 0:9:31,3
Travis Taylor: Yeah,
it ain't working


299
0:9:31,3 --> 0:9:32,4
too well today;


300
0:9:32,4 --> 0:9:33,138
we still got a
lot of work to do.


301
0:9:33,138 --> 0:9:34,439
Momma: Y'all
just keep at it.


302
0:9:34,439 --> 0:9:35,507
Michael: Well
that was easy.


303
0:9:35,507 --> 0:9:37,175
Travis Taylor: Yeah, that
was all right for now.


304
0:9:37,175 --> 0:9:38,41
Well maybe we will
make it out of


305
0:9:38,41 --> 0:9:40,579
here alive after all.


306
0:9:40,579 --> 0:9:46,785
Momma: Charles Herbert
where is my microwave?


307
0:9:46,785 --> 0:9:48,186
Travis Taylor: So we're
about ready to go.


308
0:9:48,186 --> 0:9:50,689
We're making a weapon
of the future that could


309
0:9:50,689 --> 0:9:55,694
fry enemy electronics
or an entire robot army.


310
0:9:55,694 --> 0:9:57,529
Turn it on.


311
0:9:57,529 --> 0:9:58,563
Ow whoa.


312
0:9:58,563 --> 0:10:0,565
Turn the power, power,
power, turn it off.


313
0:10:0,565 --> 0:10:2,3
Aw crap!


314
0:10:2,3 --> 0:10:3,535
We probably shouldn't
have started with


315
0:10:3,535 --> 0:10:8,73
my mom's new microwave.


316
0:10:8,73 --> 0:10:11,877
Momma: Charles Herbert,
where is my microwave?


317
0:10:11,877 --> 0:10:13,478
Rog: Oh, Charles Herbert.


318
0:10:13,478 --> 0:10:14,613
Daddy: What?


319
0:10:14,613 --> 0:10:17,149
Rog: Charlie
got in trouble.


320
0:10:17,149 --> 0:10:18,517
Travis Taylor: I'll let
Daddy handle that one.


321
0:10:18,517 --> 0:10:19,751
Michael: Yeah I'm gonna
hang out right here.


322
0:10:19,751 --> 0:10:20,952
Rog: I am going
right over here.


323
0:10:20,952 --> 0:10:22,54
Daddy: We borrowed it,


324
0:10:22,54 --> 0:10:24,589
to do a little experiment
with it out here.


325
0:10:24,589 --> 0:10:26,925
And we had a
little accident.


326
0:10:26,925 --> 0:10:28,193
Michael: Hey I'm
going with him,


327
0:10:28,193 --> 0:10:29,895
at least hide
out, out back.


328
0:10:29,895 --> 0:10:30,896
Daddy: We blew it up.


329
0:10:30,896 --> 0:10:32,564
That's the just
all there is to it.


330
0:10:32,564 --> 0:10:33,799
Momma: Just
tell them to go,


331
0:10:33,799 --> 0:10:35,167
I am done with this.


332
0:10:35,167 --> 0:10:36,101
Just tell them to go,


333
0:10:36,101 --> 0:10:37,35
I am tired of it.


334
0:10:37,35 --> 0:10:38,437
Go!


335
0:10:38,437 --> 0:10:39,871
Michael: What she saying?


336
0:10:39,871 --> 0:10:41,707
I think we'd
gettin' thrown out?


337
0:10:41,707 --> 0:10:42,774
Rog: No.


338
0:10:42,774 --> 0:10:44,209
Travis Taylor: No, we
ain't getting thrown out.


339
0:10:44,209 --> 0:10:45,243
Go in there
and ask her for


340
0:10:45,243 --> 0:10:46,611
an egg sandwich, Michael.


341
0:10:46,611 --> 0:10:49,614
Daddy: I don't believe I
would right now, Michael.


342
0:10:49,614 --> 0:10:51,65
I don't blame her
for being mad.


343
0:10:51,65 --> 0:10:53,185
Right now the best
thing we can do


344
0:10:53,185 --> 0:10:55,42
is make ourselves scarce.


345
0:10:55,42 --> 0:10:58,557
She doesn't want to see
anymore of us today.


346
0:10:58,557 --> 0:11:0,25
Travis Taylor: Making a
future weapon out of a


347
0:11:0,25 --> 0:11:3,295
microwave has turned out
to be a complete bust.


348
0:11:3,295 --> 0:11:6,398
I'm not sure what
we're gonna do.


349
0:11:6,398 --> 0:11:7,566
Then it hit me.


350
0:11:7,566 --> 0:11:9,367
I remember the US
military is working on a


351
0:11:9,367 --> 0:11:12,504
lightning gun to destroy
enemy vehicles and


352
0:11:12,504 --> 0:11:14,673
I think we can do
just that using stuff


353
0:11:14,673 --> 0:11:18,577
we can find right
here in Alabama.


354
0:11:18,577 --> 0:11:24,316
And I know just
the guy to call,


355
0:11:24,316 --> 0:11:25,617
our buddy Cameron
that Rog and


356
0:11:25,617 --> 0:11:29,988
I went to
high school with.


357
0:11:29,988 --> 0:11:32,424
Listen to that.


358
0:11:32,424 --> 0:11:33,959
Rog: What are
they playing?


359
0:11:33,959 --> 0:11:35,327
Travis Taylor:
What in the world?


360
0:11:35,327 --> 0:11:36,928
Daddy: What is that?


361
0:11:36,928 --> 0:11:41,99
Travis Taylor:
Hey, Cameron, hey.


362
0:11:41,99 --> 0:11:43,735
The first thing I see are
these two Frankenstein


363
0:11:43,735 --> 0:11:46,371
like Tesla Coils shooting
electricity everywhere


364
0:11:46,371 --> 0:11:48,44
and playing the
Camp Town Ladies.


365
0:11:48,44 --> 0:11:49,708
Rog: The Camp Town Ladies.


366
0:11:49,708 --> 0:11:50,942
Travis Taylor:
Camp town ladies,


367
0:11:50,942 --> 0:11:52,444
well talk about
these mad scientists


368
0:11:52,444 --> 0:11:53,779
up in here, man.


369
0:11:53,779 --> 0:11:54,813
Daddy: What in the world?


370
0:11:54,813 --> 0:11:56,148
Travis Taylor: That is
awesome right there.


371
0:11:56,148 --> 0:11:58,116
Cameron: I'm very happy
to show them around,


372
0:11:58,116 --> 0:11:59,417
it's been my
life's work and


373
0:11:59,417 --> 0:12:1,586
I am always happy
to talk about it.


374
0:12:1,586 --> 0:12:3,522
Travis Taylor: What you
got going on right there?


375
0:12:3,522 --> 0:12:5,924
Cameron: This is a
vacuum tube Tesla coil.


376
0:12:5,924 --> 0:12:7,459
Travis Taylor: Vacuum
tube Tesla coil.


377
0:12:7,459 --> 0:12:8,727
So instead of a
spark you've got.


378
0:12:8,727 --> 0:12:10,729
Tesla coils are named
after their inventor


379
0:12:10,729 --> 0:12:12,3
Nikola Tesla;


380
0:12:12,3 --> 0:12:14,166
he was doing all kinds
of crazy things with


381
0:12:14,166 --> 0:12:17,402
electricity more
than a 100 years ago.


382
0:12:17,402 --> 0:12:19,137
Turn that thing on man.


383
0:12:19,137 --> 0:12:20,539
Daddy: Is it safe
to stand here?


384
0:12:20,539 --> 0:12:21,573
Cameron: Yes, it is.


385
0:12:21,573 --> 0:12:22,707
Travis Taylor: Only
if you don't touch it.


386
0:12:22,707 --> 0:12:24,609
Daddy: 30,000 volts
will get my attention.


387
0:12:24,609 --> 0:12:25,944
Travis Taylor:
There it is.


388
0:12:25,944 --> 0:12:27,712
Oh that will wake you up.


389
0:12:27,712 --> 0:12:29,648
Haha, oh baby.


390
0:12:29,648 --> 0:12:32,45
The way a Tesla coil works
is electricity first moves


391
0:12:32,45 --> 0:12:35,187
through a transformer
which amps up the voltage.


392
0:12:35,187 --> 0:12:36,755
From there, it
passes through


393
0:12:36,755 --> 0:12:38,356
two coils of copper.


394
0:12:38,356 --> 0:12:41,293
They're called the primary
and secondary winders.


395
0:12:41,293 --> 0:12:43,762
That boosts the
voltage even higher,


396
0:12:43,762 --> 0:12:46,198
then that high voltage
electricity collects


397
0:12:46,198 --> 0:12:48,967
along the surface of the
big donut at the top.


398
0:12:48,967 --> 0:12:50,869
And finally, it
discharges into those


399
0:12:50,869 --> 0:12:54,739
giant crazy arcs
of lightning.


400
0:12:54,739 --> 0:12:56,174
That's cool.


401
0:12:56,174 --> 0:12:58,476
Tesla was an amazing
mad scientist guy;


402
0:12:58,476 --> 0:13:0,579
I mean he
invented AC power,


403
0:13:0,579 --> 0:13:3,348
which is what's in
every house in America.


404
0:13:3,348 --> 0:13:6,518
But the bad thing about
it is, he died dirt poor,


405
0:13:6,518 --> 0:13:8,119
but there was a
box of his notes


406
0:13:8,119 --> 0:13:9,588
that were classified
immediately;


407
0:13:9,588 --> 0:13:11,423
we still don't know
what was in that.


408
0:13:11,423 --> 0:13:13,558
You know, if anybody
invented a death ray it


409
0:13:13,558 --> 0:13:15,56
would have been Tesla.


410
0:13:15,56 --> 0:13:17,796
What do you think
about that Daddy?


411
0:13:17,796 --> 0:13:18,864
Daddy: That was crazy.


412
0:13:18,864 --> 0:13:20,98
Travis Taylor: That
I was holding a 100,000


413
0:13:20,98 --> 0:13:21,766
volts right there
with this screwdriver,


414
0:13:21,766 --> 0:13:23,34
ain't that awesome?


415
0:13:23,34 --> 0:13:24,502
When I saw these two
Tesla coils by each other


416
0:13:24,502 --> 0:13:26,238
and they're throwing
sparks a few feet away,


417
0:13:26,238 --> 0:13:30,41
there's our beam
weapon right there.


418
0:13:30,41 --> 0:13:31,943
The challenge is that
lightning likes to take a


419
0:13:31,943 --> 0:13:35,447
random path through
the air to the ground.


420
0:13:35,447 --> 0:13:36,948
To weaponize it,
you need to give it


421
0:13:36,948 --> 0:13:39,251
a path to follow.


422
0:13:39,251 --> 0:13:41,953
The military is trying to
do this with a laser beam.


423
0:13:41,953 --> 0:13:46,958
I think we can do it with
a stream of argon gas.


424
0:13:46,958 --> 0:13:48,76
Cameron gave us
these pieces we needed


425
0:13:48,76 --> 0:13:50,996
to put together
a giant Tesla coil.


426
0:13:50,996 --> 0:13:54,432
This is gonna be exciting,
but really dangerous.


427
0:13:54,432 --> 0:13:56,368
At some point here
I need to be starting


428
0:13:56,368 --> 0:13:57,736
on us a Faraday cage.


429
0:13:57,736 --> 0:13:59,371
If we're gonna build a
big Tesla coil that is


430
0:13:59,371 --> 0:14:3,341
throwing arcs and stuff we
need a safe place to hide.


431
0:14:3,341 --> 0:14:4,743
Kinda like the
Faraday cage on a


432
0:14:4,743 --> 0:14:7,178
microwave keeps the
dangerous radiation in,


433
0:14:7,178 --> 0:14:9,8
we need something that's
gonna keep the high


434
0:14:9,8 --> 0:14:11,249
voltage from the
Tesla coil out and


435
0:14:11,249 --> 0:14:13,318
it's got to big enough
for us to fit into.


436
0:14:13,318 --> 0:14:15,387
Luckily, I've got an
old dog kennel over


437
0:14:15,387 --> 0:14:17,756
at the house that I think
is gonna be just perfect.


438
0:14:17,756 --> 0:14:19,324
Daddy: Not only
metaphorically,


439
0:14:19,324 --> 0:14:21,793
we're literally gonna
be in the doghouse?


440
0:14:21,793 --> 0:14:22,694
Travis Taylor: Yes.


441
0:14:22,694 --> 0:14:23,962
Daddy:<i> [laughing].</i>


442
0:14:23,962 --> 0:14:27,832
I love it!


443
0:14:27,832 --> 0:14:28,867
Michael: We need
to do this at


444
0:14:28,867 --> 0:14:30,502
the same time Pete.


445
0:14:30,502 --> 0:14:35,44
Pete: Yeah.


446
0:14:35,44 --> 0:14:37,475
Travis Taylor: We need to
get that inside there,


447
0:14:37,475 --> 0:14:39,444
that's the high
voltage power supply.


448
0:14:39,444 --> 0:14:41,913
There you go, that
makes too much sense.


449
0:14:41,913 --> 0:14:43,348
Now we're gonna go right
over there in the middle


450
0:14:43,348 --> 0:14:45,116
of the open area.


451
0:14:45,116 --> 0:14:47,419
We rolled out our
primary winding,


452
0:14:47,419 --> 0:14:50,622
and then set the
secondary on top of that.


453
0:14:50,622 --> 0:14:52,39
Rog, throw another
hand up in there.


454
0:14:52,39 --> 0:14:54,159
Let me get that wire
coming down towards you.


455
0:14:54,159 --> 0:14:55,894
All right, the wire
is in the hole.


456
0:14:55,894 --> 0:14:57,162
Michael: Where you
gonna grab it to?


457
0:14:57,162 --> 0:14:58,83
Daddy: I don't know.


458
0:14:58,83 --> 0:15:0,632
Travis Taylor:
We in like Flynn.


459
0:15:0,632 --> 0:15:3,802
And finally, the giant
donut goes on top.


460
0:15:3,802 --> 0:15:6,871
Man, this thing is
gonna be so wicked.


461
0:15:6,871 --> 0:15:9,174
Daddy: I'm looking at this
thing and this is crazy.


462
0:15:9,174 --> 0:15:12,344
It's 3 or 4 times bigger
than the one we saw before


463
0:15:12,344 --> 0:15:15,58
and I'm thinking, this is
mad scientist stuff and I


464
0:15:15,58 --> 0:15:17,315
don't know if I like it.


465
0:15:17,315 --> 0:15:18,717
Travis Taylor: I betcha
it'll throw arcs out to


466
0:15:18,717 --> 0:15:20,585
here, at least, at least.


467
0:15:20,585 --> 0:15:22,387
Rog: I wanted us to have
a target that was flesh


468
0:15:22,387 --> 0:15:25,59
and blood, so we're
gonna test our death ray


469
0:15:25,59 --> 0:15:26,992
on a frozen turkey.


470
0:15:26,992 --> 0:15:28,226
Travis Taylor: Look
at this right here.


471
0:15:28,226 --> 0:15:29,294
Michael: What
did you find?


472
0:15:29,294 --> 0:15:30,962
Travis Taylor: To create
our stream of argon gas


473
0:15:30,962 --> 0:15:33,31
that will direct all that
electricity towards the


474
0:15:33,31 --> 0:15:35,166
turkey, we're gonna turn
one of Michael's old


475
0:15:35,166 --> 0:15:39,404
pressure washers into
a Tesla coil gun.


476
0:15:39,404 --> 0:15:41,606
To make our gun we're
gonna take the voltage


477
0:15:41,606 --> 0:15:43,608
from the top of the Tesla
coil and run it into the


478
0:15:43,608 --> 0:15:46,378
pressure washer barrel,
then it meets up with the


479
0:15:46,378 --> 0:15:49,28
argon gas from the tank
which flows to the gun


480
0:15:49,28 --> 0:15:51,683
through a non
conductive rubber hose.


481
0:15:51,683 --> 0:15:54,285
The electricity will
ionize the gas and then


482
0:15:54,285 --> 0:15:56,588
shoot out of the gun
and hit the target.


483
0:15:56,588 --> 0:15:59,657
There we go, right there.


484
0:15:59,657 --> 0:16:1,559
Michael: I gotta operate
the gas from outside the


485
0:16:1,559 --> 0:16:3,695
Faraday cage, so I'm
moving clear to the other


486
0:16:3,695 --> 0:16:6,998
end of the garage so those
arcs can't reach me.


487
0:16:6,998 --> 0:16:8,6
I'm gonna operate
it from right here.


488
0:16:8,6 --> 0:16:10,135
Travis Taylor: Oh yeah
that will be good.


489
0:16:10,135 --> 0:16:12,404
Hey, Michael run the gas.


490
0:16:12,404 --> 0:16:13,405
Michael: All right.


491
0:16:13,405 --> 0:16:14,406
Travis Taylor:
Here we go,


492
0:16:14,406 --> 0:16:15,607
coming up
with the voltage.


493
0:16:15,607 --> 0:16:17,42
Daddy: Pete,
watch your head.


494
0:16:17,42 --> 0:16:19,344
Travis Taylor:
I'm seeing sparks.


495
0:16:19,344 --> 0:16:26,918
Yeah, I saw something.


496
0:16:26,918 --> 0:16:28,386
Fire, fire!


497
0:16:28,386 --> 0:16:30,55
<i> [loud screeching sound]</i>


498
0:16:30,55 --> 0:16:36,461
Michael: Cut it
off, cut it off.


499
0:16:36,461 --> 0:16:38,53
Daddy: We're performing
real science experiments,


500
0:16:38,53 --> 0:16:40,331
with dangerous
chemicals and tools.


501
0:16:40,331 --> 0:16:41,633
We're professionals and


502
0:16:41,633 --> 0:16:43,601
we take every
safety precaution.


503
0:16:43,601 --> 0:16:46,404
Don't try these
experiments at home.


504
0:16:46,404 --> 0:16:48,273
Travis Taylor: We're
using a million volts of


505
0:16:48,273 --> 0:16:51,576
electricity from a giant
Tesla coil to make a


506
0:16:51,576 --> 0:16:55,213
weapon of the future, a
lightning bolt death ray.


507
0:16:55,213 --> 0:16:56,915
Fire, fire!


508
0:16:56,915 --> 0:16:58,516
<i> [loud screeching noise]</i>


509
0:16:58,516 --> 0:17:0,318
Michael: Cut it off,
cut it off!


510
0:17:0,318 --> 0:17:3,521
Something is conducting.


511
0:17:3,521 --> 0:17:4,789
Travis Taylor: But
it's not working out


512
0:17:4,789 --> 0:17:6,324
like we planned.


513
0:17:6,324 --> 0:17:7,492
Michael: It ran
straight down here.


514
0:17:7,492 --> 0:17:8,793
Travis Taylor: It ran
right down that wire,


515
0:17:8,793 --> 0:17:9,761
look at that.


516
0:17:9,761 --> 0:17:11,229
Michael: And it's
a rubber hose.


517
0:17:11,229 --> 0:17:12,864
Travis Taylor: It turns
out that the electricity


518
0:17:12,864 --> 0:17:14,566
actually travelled
backwards along the


519
0:17:14,566 --> 0:17:16,534
hose to the
gas canister and


520
0:17:16,534 --> 0:17:18,403
gave Michael a
bit of a jolt.


521
0:17:18,403 --> 0:17:19,637
You all right, Michael?


522
0:17:19,637 --> 0:17:20,605
Michael: Yeah.


523
0:17:20,605 --> 0:17:21,639
Travis Taylor: Did
it kill your phone?


524
0:17:21,639 --> 0:17:22,74
Michael: I don't
know, I need to look.


525
0:17:22,74 --> 0:17:24,409
Daddy: I don't know if it
killed his phone or not,


526
0:17:24,409 --> 0:17:25,91
but it went and
made my hearing aids


527
0:17:25,91 --> 0:17:28,146
go totally crazy.


528
0:17:28,146 --> 0:17:29,247
Travis Taylor: Oh
I believe that.


529
0:17:29,247 --> 0:17:30,415
Daddy: They started
making some kind of


530
0:17:30,415 --> 0:17:32,784
surreal scream, about
bust my brains out.


531
0:17:32,784 --> 0:17:34,419
I don't think anybody
on our crew has worked


532
0:17:34,419 --> 0:17:35,787
with this kind of voltage;


533
0:17:35,787 --> 0:17:38,223
it's something we don't
know a lot about and


534
0:17:38,223 --> 0:17:41,426
that's when you
usually get hurt.


535
0:17:41,426 --> 0:17:42,76
Travis Taylor: The
mistake we made was


536
0:17:42,76 --> 0:17:45,196
putting our gas hose
too close to the floor.


537
0:17:45,196 --> 0:17:47,98
Since lightning likes to
take the shortest path to


538
0:17:47,98 --> 0:17:50,1
ground, the electricity
followed the gas hose


539
0:17:50,1 --> 0:17:52,437
instead of channeling out
the barrel of the gun.


540
0:17:52,437 --> 0:17:53,838
Daddy: You look at that
and tell me how an


541
0:17:53,838 --> 0:17:55,84
electrical current
followed that.


542
0:17:55,84 --> 0:17:57,942
Michael: 'Cause
a million volts,


543
0:17:57,942 --> 0:17:59,31
a million volts
will follow a lot


544
0:17:59,31 --> 0:18:0,645
more than you think.


545
0:18:0,645 --> 0:18:2,113
The thing probably weighs.


546
0:18:2,113 --> 0:18:3,781
Travis Taylor: So what
we've gotta do now,


547
0:18:3,781 --> 0:18:5,83
is raise the gas
canister and


548
0:18:5,83 --> 0:18:6,751
the hose up off the ground.


549
0:18:6,751 --> 0:18:8,186
We need to get a
ladder up in here.


550
0:18:8,186 --> 0:18:10,288
And get it higher
than the gun barrel.


551
0:18:10,288 --> 0:18:12,49
Move forward a
little bit more, ho,


552
0:18:12,49 --> 0:18:13,525
ho that looks good.


553
0:18:13,525 --> 0:18:14,893
Go get your
bucket steer and


554
0:18:14,893 --> 0:18:18,396
let's put the tank up there.


555
0:18:18,396 --> 0:18:20,832
Rog: Look at old Yerp!


556
0:18:20,832 --> 0:18:22,734
Travis Taylor:
Yeah, I gotcha Pete.


557
0:18:22,734 --> 0:18:24,102
Hey, how did I end
up on the short end


558
0:18:24,102 --> 0:18:25,603
of this deal?


559
0:18:25,603 --> 0:18:27,438
Rog where are you?


560
0:18:27,438 --> 0:18:28,907
Rog: Oh we're gonna ride?


561
0:18:28,907 --> 0:18:30,708
Travis Taylor: Yeah.


562
0:18:30,708 --> 0:18:33,11
♪ Rog: I wanna ride,
I wanna ride, ♪


563
0:18:33,11 --> 0:18:36,281
♪ I wanna ride. ♪


564
0:18:36,281 --> 0:18:37,782
Travis Taylor:
Yo, right there.


565
0:18:37,782 --> 0:18:39,484
All right, Rog,
just see if we can,


566
0:18:39,484 --> 0:18:42,53
just slide it.


567
0:18:42,53 --> 0:18:43,821
Michael: That's good.


568
0:18:43,821 --> 0:18:45,123
Travis Taylor: The
tank is sitting on a


569
0:18:45,123 --> 0:18:47,225
Lazy Susan so now we
can move it around to


570
0:18:47,225 --> 0:18:49,294
point the lightning gun.


571
0:18:49,294 --> 0:18:51,362
We can control it with
some fishing line that


572
0:18:51,362 --> 0:18:54,532
goes all the way back
to the Faraday cage.


573
0:18:54,532 --> 0:18:56,901
Give us plenty
of room Pete.


574
0:18:56,901 --> 0:19:0,4
All right that's
probably good.


575
0:19:0,4 --> 0:19:2,64
Pete, you done tying
that string yet?


576
0:19:2,64 --> 0:19:4,275
We're switching
from a rubber hose to


577
0:19:4,275 --> 0:19:6,611
copper tubing so it'll
conduct the electricity


578
0:19:6,611 --> 0:19:10,114
and channel it out the
barrel like we want it to.


579
0:19:10,114 --> 0:19:12,217
All we got to do now
is connect the wire


580
0:19:12,217 --> 0:19:15,153
to this tank over
to the Tesla coil.


581
0:19:15,153 --> 0:19:16,387
Rog is steering.


582
0:19:16,387 --> 0:19:17,555
Pete: Oh you are.


583
0:19:17,555 --> 0:19:18,523
Travis Taylor:
That's all right.


584
0:19:18,523 --> 0:19:19,591
Pete: I was wondering
why this thing


585
0:19:19,591 --> 0:19:20,491
is getting away from me.


586
0:19:20,491 --> 0:19:21,893
Travis Taylor: It
works great, Rog.


587
0:19:21,893 --> 0:19:23,228
I think we got
ourselves a gun now.


588
0:19:23,228 --> 0:19:25,33
So, let's go get us some
targets and set up out


589
0:19:25,33 --> 0:19:28,666
here and let's
test this thing.


590
0:19:28,666 --> 0:19:30,435
A weapon of the
future is gonna have


591
0:19:30,435 --> 0:19:32,737
to destroy an army
of the future.


592
0:19:32,737 --> 0:19:35,106
So it's gonna have to
fry their electronics.


593
0:19:35,106 --> 0:19:36,207
What are you doing?


594
0:19:36,207 --> 0:19:37,976
It will destroy
that computer.


595
0:19:37,976 --> 0:19:39,844
Michael: Good, I'm
tired of this thing.


596
0:19:39,844 --> 0:19:41,312
Travis Taylor: Michael
has agreed to donate an


597
0:19:41,312 --> 0:19:43,414
old laptop of his, so
that we can begin the


598
0:19:43,414 --> 0:19:45,683
fight against the
rise of the machines.


599
0:19:45,683 --> 0:19:47,518
Well let's see if we
can blow it up then.


600
0:19:47,518 --> 0:19:51,22
Get up there and
turn that gas on.


601
0:19:51,22 --> 0:19:52,49
Get out of there now.


602
0:19:52,49 --> 0:19:55,46
Come on over here,
watch the strings.


603
0:19:55,46 --> 0:19:57,829
Close the door.


604
0:19:57,829 --> 0:20:12,43
All right coming up.


605
0:20:12,43 --> 0:20:13,244
Whoa!


606
0:20:13,244 --> 0:20:15,647
<i> [laughing].</i>


607
0:20:15,647 --> 0:20:17,415
Daddy: When that arc
hit the computer,


608
0:20:17,415 --> 0:20:25,79
it just exploded.


609
0:20:25,79 --> 0:20:27,892
Pete: Shut the gas off.


610
0:20:27,892 --> 0:20:30,928
Travis Taylor:
I love that.


611
0:20:30,928 --> 0:20:34,399
<i> [laughing]</i>


612
0:20:34,399 --> 0:20:35,9
Rog: What made it
smoke like that?


613
0:20:35,9 --> 0:20:37,402
Travis Taylor: Oh
man, look at that.


614
0:20:37,402 --> 0:20:38,97
Look at the keys, man.


615
0:20:38,97 --> 0:20:40,371
Look at that right there.


616
0:20:40,371 --> 0:20:41,773
Son that joker is hot.


617
0:20:41,773 --> 0:20:42,874
Look at that.


618
0:20:42,874 --> 0:20:44,876
That is too cool man.


619
0:20:44,876 --> 0:20:47,11
I want to blow
something else up.


620
0:20:47,11 --> 0:20:49,147
We've seen what our
Tesla coil gun can do


621
0:20:49,147 --> 0:20:51,249
against an old laptop.


622
0:20:51,249 --> 0:20:52,65
That sure ain't
gonna work is it?


623
0:20:52,65 --> 0:20:53,718
Michael: No.


624
0:20:53,718 --> 0:20:54,919
Travis Taylor: Now,
it's gonna have to take


625
0:20:54,919 --> 0:20:56,387
on an army of the future.


626
0:20:56,387 --> 0:20:58,823
Look here, we got
us an army here man.


627
0:20:58,823 --> 0:21:0,758
Set them out there
somewhere Rog.


628
0:21:0,758 --> 0:21:2,226
See if we can get 'em.


629
0:21:2,226 --> 0:21:3,961
All right Pete, ya'll
get in the cage,


630
0:21:3,961 --> 0:21:8,232
Michael, get the gas going.


631
0:21:8,232 --> 0:21:17,275
Get in here,
sending it up.


632
0:21:17,275 --> 0:21:27,318
Go Pete, go Pete.


633
0:21:27,318 --> 0:21:32,23
Holy crap.


634
0:21:32,23 --> 0:21:39,564
Lookie here, his
back is on fire.


635
0:21:39,564 --> 0:21:41,833
<i> [explosion]</i>


636
0:21:41,833 --> 0:21:43,668
Whoa.


637
0:21:43,668 --> 0:21:45,803
<i> [laughing]</i>


638
0:21:45,803 --> 0:21:47,138
Michael: Let's
go check it out.


639
0:21:47,138 --> 0:21:49,44
Travis Taylor: Now
that's cool right there.


640
0:21:49,44 --> 0:21:51,509
I'd say that gun
works awesome.


641
0:21:51,509 --> 0:21:52,877
Daddy: That it does.


642
0:21:52,877 --> 0:21:54,145
Travis Taylor: Hey,
that's a future weapon


643
0:21:54,145 --> 0:21:56,18
for future menacing
robots, right there.


644
0:21:56,18 --> 0:21:57,281
Pete: That's right.


645
0:21:57,281 --> 0:21:58,75
Travis Taylor: Man,
that is just too cool.


646
0:21:58,75 --> 0:21:59,851
Michael: Look at
that, you blew the


647
0:21:59,851 --> 0:22:0,918
whole top of that one off.


648
0:22:0,918 --> 0:22:2,82
Travis Taylor: Blew
his head right off.


649
0:22:2,82 --> 0:22:5,523
Michael: Oh shoot,
it's going, get back.


650
0:22:5,523 --> 0:22:7,91
Rog: Go york, get it york.


651
0:22:7,91 --> 0:22:11,295
Travis Taylor:
Hit it, Michael.


652
0:22:11,295 --> 0:22:14,665
Now, this weapon may not
be deployable right now,


653
0:22:14,665 --> 0:22:16,434
but imagine firing
something like this from


654
0:22:16,434 --> 0:22:19,3
space or the air at a
high tech facility and


655
0:22:19,3 --> 0:22:23,4
destroying all
their electronics.


656
0:22:23,4 --> 0:22:25,877
With 100-year-old Tesla
technology we made a


657
0:22:25,877 --> 0:22:28,212
weapon of the
future today.


658
0:22:28,212 --> 0:22:29,68
Michael: What's up,
let's blow them up.


659
0:22:29,68 --> 0:22:31,449
Travis Taylor: An
invading army of


660
0:22:31,449 --> 0:22:39,991
robots wouldn't
stand a chance.


661
0:22:39,991 --> 0:24:39,991
Momma: Where
are my robots?
