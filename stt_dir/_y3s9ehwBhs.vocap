###16 SHANE SMITH: So we go see [INAUDIBLE].
###18 Thank you, North Korea, you blew our minds.
###21 But time is ticking, we got into North Korea and all I'm
###24 going to have is footage of monuments and libraries.
###27 We're bummed.
###28 I have the shits.
###31 I don't know what the fuck I'm eating half the time.
###35 We're very tired.
###36 We're going to go out getting drunk with our guides tonight.
###38 Hopefully they'll let us shoot more.
###40 
###43 I look like a used car salesman from
###45 Boca Raton or something.
###47 
###50 What does anyone do at Pyongyang at night?
###52 There's nothing.
###53 There's zero to do.
###54 But in our hotel there's a karaoke place.
###57 And the only people who go to karaoke are foreigners,
###59 generals, and high-ranking party officials.
###62 MALE SPEAKER: Check, check, check.
###63 1, 2.
###63 [INAUDIBLE]
###64 1, 2, 1, 2.
###65 
###73 SHANE SMITH: So we get drunk.
###74 We meet these generals, we're partying with them, and we're
###77 like how do you get anything done here?
###80 How do we go see these film studios?
###82 And they were very cautious.
###83 They said look, I'm not going to stick my neck out and tell
###85 you anything.
###86 But here's a word of advice--
###88 dress like us, pay your respects to Kim Il-sung at the
###91 statue, and see what happens.
###93 
###99 So we're like, OK, let's go get some clothes.
###102 Problem is, you can't.
###103 You can't go to a store, you can't even handle the money.
###107 So we had to find a tailor and say hey, can
###109 you make us a suit?
###110 And by the way, we need it in five hours.
###113 What we want to do is we want to get North Korean-like
###117 clothes and a badge, and go and pay
###120 respects to Kim Il-sung.
###122 MR. KIM: You say that [INAUDIBLE]
###125 Kim Il-sung.
###126 You don't say--
###127 SHANE SMITH: Kim Jong-Il.
###129 MR. KIM: The Chairman Kim Jong-Il, or
###132 Great Leader Kim Jong-Il.
###134 We only say it like that.
###136 So please say it like that, Great Leader Kim Jong-Il,
###141 General Kim Jong-Il, and Chairman Kim Jong-Il.
###143 SHANE SMITH: And what about Kim Il-sung?
###145 Great leader?
###146 MR. KIM: President Kim Il-sung.
###146 SHANE SMITH: President Kim Il-sung.
###147 OK.
###148 Can we go to where he lies in state, the Kim Il-sung Palace?
###153 Great Leader Kim Il-sung Palace?
###154 MR. KIM: Great Leader Kim Jong-Il, General Kim Jong-Il,
###159 Chairman Kim Jong-Il.
###159 SHANE SMITH: President Kim Il-sung.
###161 MR. KIM: Yeah.
###162 SHANE SMITH: OK.
###163 Now, does Kim Jong-Il have a son?
###166 MALE SPEAKER: Chairman.
###167 MR. KIM: General Kim Jong-Il.
###167 SHANE SMITH: Oh, General Kim Jong-Il.
###169 Does he have a son?
###170 MR. KIM: I don't know.
###171 We only respect our General Kim Jong-Il.
###173 SHANE SMITH: I'm going to respect them both.
###174 I'm going to leave flowers.
###176 MR. KIM: That's a good idea, that's perfect.
###178 We are friends now.
###179 SHANE SMITH: We're friends.
###179 MR. KIM: If you respect to--
###181 SHANE SMITH: We'll be best friends.
###181 MR. KIM: With your hearts.
###183 Respect our General Kim Jong-Il and President Kim
###185 Il-sung with your hearts, we'll be best friends.
###188 SHANE SMITH: Good.
###188 MR. KIM: [INAUDIBLE]
###189 SHANE SMITH: I'm excited.
###190 I can't wait.
###191 
###198 I want like this, but lighter.
###201 Yeah, yeah, perfect.
###203 We're going to look like that when we're done.
###205 
###215 We're about to go pay our respects to the Great Leader
###217 Kim Il-sung, Eternal President.
###220 Let's go [? do it. ?]
###221 
###229 After that, everything changed.
###232 Smiles all around.
###233 What do you want to do?
###234 Where you want to go?
###236 And finally, they let us go see the
###238 North Korean film studios.
###240 
###247 
###285 SHANE SMITH: Thank you.
###286 
###293 So we're at the film studios in Pyongyang in North Korea.
###296 This is the Great Leader Kim Il-sung
###298 behind us with the cameras.
###300 Let's go and check out how they make
###302 films in North Korea.
###306 MR. PAK:
###307 
###323 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###325 
###329 SHANE SMITH: General Kim Jong-Il made a film of the
###331 Great Leader Kim Il-sung?
###333 He made a film?
###333 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###334 
###337 SHANE SMITH: OK.
###338 Shall we go inside?
###339 
###356 So we're in the film studio now.
###358 We're being introduced by a very amazing picture of
###362 General Kim Jong-Il.
###364 He's directing a mega-picture of the war.
###368 [WHISPERING]
###369 It's totally insane.
###370 I shouldn't say it's totally insane.
###373 It's totally insane.
###374
