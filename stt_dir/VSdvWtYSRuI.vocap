###0 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###10 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: We're in Jamaica, an island known for
###12 its idyllic beaches and stunning natural beauty.
###14 But we're here to find out about something that frankly,
###17 most Jamaicans are uncomfortable talking about.
###20 It's called Obeah, and it's an Afro-Caribbean religion that
###22 has its roots in magic and sorcery.
###25 My co-pilot for this trip is Natalia from Colombia.
###27 NATALIA SANCHEZ: So happy to be here.
###28 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Good to see you.
###30 Natalia, tell me about yourself.
###31 NATALIA SANCHEZ: Well, I'm originally
###33 from Bogota, Colombia.
###35 I've been living in Amsterdam for the past couple years.
###38 I work as a media researcher.
###41 I've been looking into communication and
###44 representation of physical suffering in different media.
###47 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So pain.
###48 NATALIA SANCHEZ: Pain and suffering, yeah.
###50 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Oh, boy.
###50 NATALIA SANCHEZ: So why are we looking into Obeah?
###53 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: OK, so Obeah is an occult folk religion.
###56 And so it's kind of like voodoo and
###58 Santeria, but it's different.
###59 There's something distinct and Jamaican about it.
###61 There's good aspects of it and then there's kind of evil
###64 aspects of it.
###65 People seem to take it really seriously.
###67 I've read about an Obeah man who was stoned to death by a
###70 mob because he was allegedly casting
###73 curses upon the villagers.
###75 NATALIA SANCHEZ: That's awful.
###76 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah.
###76 Well, so people take it really seriously.
###78 So we want to find out, why do people feel threatened by it?
###81 What about it is good?
###83 What about it is evil?
###84 And how does it interface with modern Jamaican culture?
###88 The first place we're going to go is an occult
###90 shop, an Obeah shop.
###91 So it has sort of like the materials and the things that
###94 you need for an Obeah man to do rituals and stuff.
###97 NATALIA SANCHEZ: Sounds exciting.
###98 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, well, honestly, I'm a
###99 little scared, you know?
###100 Like who knows what kind of curses we'll get.
###103 Hopefully good ones.
###104 
###146 NATALIA SANCHEZ: Look at this, guys.
###148 The vagina candle.
###149 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: The vagina candle.
###150 We found it.
###151 You like the vagina candle?
###154 What about those oils over there?
###155 ONEIL MILES: They have various oils for
###157 various different reasons.
###159 They have fast luck when people think they are not
###162 lucky, and buy the fast luck if they want to have holy man
###166 oil if a woman want her man to come back.
###169 You have oils for almost every reason.
###172 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: What do you do with the oil?
###172 You just put it on your body or do you--
###174 is there a ceremony?
###175 Like what is the process?
###177 ONEIL MILES: That's when you go to the Obeah man.
###178 He'll give the instructions.
###180 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So you go to the Obeah man.
###181 ONEIL MILES: Tell him your problem, and with him giving
###184 you the solution, he'll give you like a prescription, like
###186 with the drug--
###187 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Oh, so you're like a drugstore.
###187 You're kind of like a pharmacy.
###189 ONEIL MILES: Right.
###189 So we supply the material that's on the prescription.
###194 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: I see.
###194 I see there's sprays up there.
###195 ONEIL MILES: There are sprays, perfumes, holders, oils,
###199 incense, bath, candles, and they go as far as you have
###204 amulets, lucky pendants, things for moving pendants.
###209 OK.
###209 This is the Go Away Evil.
###211 For protection.
###212 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: What's the most popular thing people buy?
###214 ONEIL MILES: You have the fastest-selling one.
###215 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: This is a fastest-selling one.
###216 ONEIL MILES: Right, Go Away Evil.
###217 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: It says Go Away Evil.
###218 NATALIA SANCHEZ: I can't imagine that'd
###219 be the popular one.
###219 ONEIL MILES: And everybody wants money, so money's
###220 another fast-selling one.
###221 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So you truly believe that these things--
###224 ONEIL MILES: I believe.
###225 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: You believe.
###225 ONEIL MILES: If I believe?
###226 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
###227 ONEIL MILES: Well, I mean, To sell all these products, I
###229 have to believe in them, but I've never actually tried it.
###233 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: You've never tried it?
###234 ONEIL MILES: No, I'll spray it, but as I said, it go with
###236 instructions.
###237 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Well, so can you tell us where we can find
###239 a really good Obeah man so we can try for ourselves?
###242 ONEIL MILES: Well, when you leave here, you could go down
###244 by Walderston to meet Joseph.
###247 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Joseph.
###247 NATALIA SANCHEZ: OK.
###248 Let's go meet Joseph.
###249 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: All right.
###250 Let's do it.
###251 Thanks a lot.
###251 NATALIA SANCHEZ: Thank you.
###252 ONEIL MILES: You're welcome.
###253 
###257 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: All right, Natalia.
###258 It looks like we've driven up a few hours into the interior
###261 of the island.
###262 NATALIA SANCHEZ: Let's go find Joseph.
###263 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Maybe I'll ask this guy over here.
###265 Excuse me, do you know where Joseph is?
###267 MAN ON STREET: Joseph?
###268 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah.
###268 You know Joseph?
###269 The Obeah man?
###270 MAN ON STREET: Turn right over here then--
###272 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Right around the gate up there?
###273 Thanks, buddy.
###273 MAN ON STREET: [INAUDIBLE].
###275 NATALIA SANCHEZ: Thank you.
###276 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Thank you to you, too.
###278 MAN ON STREET: Turn right for Joseph.
###279 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: OK.
###281 All right.
###282 NATALIA SANCHEZ: So it seems we're kind of close.
###283 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah.
###283 NATALIA SANCHEZ: OK.
###284 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: We're close.
###285 We just got to go the jerk center, and that's where
###287 Joseph the Obeah man will be.
###289 Hey, are you Joseph?
###291 JOSEPH WALDER: Yes, I'm Joseph.
###292 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Hey, how you doing?
###293 NATALIA SANCHEZ: Hi.
###293 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So could you take us to your place?
###295 JOSEPH WALDER: Yes, I can [INAUDIBLE].
###296 You're welcome.
###296 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Down here?
###297 JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.
###297 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: OK, let's go.
###298 Joseph the Obeah man was a handful.
###301 It was really difficult to sort of discern one single
###303 straight line of his sort of philosophy and practice and
###306 thinking, because he just did everything.
###308 I have a really basic question.
###309 Just what is Obeah?
###311 JOSEPH WALDER: Obeah is a thing that-- it originated
###314 long time ago.
###315 And God gave man the privilege to help themselves when they
###321 are in problems.
###321 [INAUDIBLE]
###323 choose different, different race and creed.
###327 Like the Hebrew, no one can go into the Ark of the Kabbalah
###331 and speak certain word and it come to manifested.
###334 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So Obeah, where did it come from?
###336 JOSEPH WALDER: Obeah come from Africa.
###338 Obeah come from Africa.
###340 NATALIA SANCHEZ: What kind of people come
###341 here looking for you?
###343 JOSEPH WALDER: People from all walks of life.
###345 Doctors come here.
###346 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Really?
###347 JOSEPH WALDER: Police come here.
###348 Soldiers come here.
###350 NATALIA SANCHEZ: Are you scared to practice?
###352 I know that some Obeah man has been--
###355 JOSEPH WALDER: Killed.
###355 NATALIA SANCHEZ: Have been killed, yes.
###356 How do you feel about-- what do you think about that?
###358 JOSEPH WALDER: Because they are con artists and they take
###359 people money and they don't complete the job.
###361 So they don't know what-- many of them out
###363 there are con artists.
###365 If you want to get genuine science or help, you come to
###367 Jo-Jo, you will get it.
###369 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So you don't think it's because they're
###369 scared of the black magic?
###371 NATALIA SANCHEZ: And because they get, like--
###373 they're--
###373 they steal from people?
###375 JOSEPH WALDER: Yes, and some of them kill people.
###376 Some people come-- for instance, a man carried
###378 $500,000 and put it down there and said Jo-Jo, me want to
###381 kill somebody.
###382 You know what I do to him?
###383 Said take your backside and go out of place.
###385 But now I meet this nice beautiful lady
###388 and I wanted her.
###390 Those Obeah man do something to manipulate it
###393 for she to love you.
###394 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: OK.
###395 JOSEPH WALDER: But I don't do that.
###396 I don't force anybody to love.
###398 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So you don't do, like, vagina candle stuff,
###399 or penis candle?
###401 JOSEPH WALDER: No, no, no, no.
###402 I don't have to do-- this is the vagina candle stuff and
###405 the penis stuff.
###405 I use herb to do that.
###406 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: OK.
###407 JOSEPH WALDER: I use herb.
###408 And I have this herb even-- many people might not know I
###411 have thing that greater than the doctor.
###413 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: You do?
###414 JOSEPH WALDER: Yes, I have thing right in here that is
###416 greater than what the doctor would use.
###417 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Have you every seen a demon?
###419 JOSEPH WALDER: Of course.
###420 I have seen many demons.
###422 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: What do they look like?
###423 JOSEPH WALDER: They are ugly-looking creatures.
###425 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So wait, OK, so you're saying, you see
###427 things that other people can't see.
###428 JOSEPH WALDER: I see things what other people cannot see.
###430 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: But then how did the oils and
###432 your various remedies--
###432 JOSEPH WALDER: Yes, that I use--
###433 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: How do those two things go together?
###435 JOSEPH WALDER: Well, I combinate it
###437 and I bless it up.
###438 Because you have to have books with things to help people.
###441 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So you gotta show us some, some ways to
###443 ward off evil.
###444 You have to show us ways to get--
###445 JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.
###445 To ward off evil.
###446 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: I want to see you in action, because if
###447 you're a superhero against evil--
###449 JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.
###449 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Let's see what you do.
###451 JOSEPH WALDER: Krishna, Natalia.
###452 Krishna, Natalia.
###455 It's a goat eating a carrot.
###456 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: That's nice.
###458 
###460 I see--
###461 I really--
###462 JOSEPH WALDER: Something standing there.
###463 That is a spirit.
###466 NATALIA SANCHEZ: (QUIETLY) I'm scared.
###467 JOSEPH WALDER: This one is Eye of Isis.
###469 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Eye of Isis, like from Egyptian stuff.
###471 JOSEPH WALDER: Yeah.
###471 Some.
###472 But I have to go back into Egypt to get all my--
###476 I stay right here.
###477 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: You stay here, but you go to Egypt.
###479 JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.
###479 I go there.
###480 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: That sounds like a--
###481 JOSEPH WALDER: To get information from books.
###482 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: From Egyptian--
###484 the Library of Alexandria.
###486 JOSEPH WALDER: I--I, I read this book,
###487 The Book of the Dead.
###488 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Uh-huh.
###489 JOSEPH WALDER: Yeah, because--
###490 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, the Egyptian Book of the Dead.
###492 JOSEPH WALDER: The Egyptian Book of the Dead.
###493 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: I really want to see something--
###494 yeah, I see something standing there.
###495 JOSEPH WALDER: Right, that is like a female
###497 carrot and a white hat.
###499 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: A white hat?
###500 JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.
###500 But there is a demon behind that spirit.
###502 Look there.
###503 Look.
###505 See the person standing here?
###508 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Uh-huh.
###508 JOSEPH WALDER: Look right here.
###510 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: And there's the demon.
###512 JOSEPH WALDER: That's the demon.
###513 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So what does that mean?
###513 JOSEPH WALDER: You guys gonna meet someone.
###516 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: OK.
###517 JOSEPH WALDER: Many things that I see in the crystal is
###519 things to come.
###522 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Would you come and anoint the car?
###525 JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.
###526 I'm going to anoint the car.
###527 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Awesome.
###527 JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.
###528 I'm going to anoint it.
###529 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: I'll open up the hood for you.
###531 NATALIA SANCHEZ: So we're going to have a safe trip.
###533 JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.
###533 I'm going to make you have a safe trip.
###535 That's it.
###537 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: At the end of the day, I think he thinks
###539 he's really helping people, and like the people in his
###541 close circle seem to think that he does
###544 good things for people.
###545 The very sort of scatter-shot nature of his whole deal
###548 seemed like he was just try to pull one over on us.
###552 Trying to find people to actually talk to us on camera
###554 about Obeah has been next to impossible.
###556 People will be like, yeah, go down there, take your second
###559 left at the bridge, there's woman there who practices.
###562 But as soon as you're asking them to speak on the record,
###565 they shy up.
###565 And I think that's because it's something you don't want
###568 to fuck with.
###568 We got a tip that there was an Obeah woman who practiced
###571 pretty near where we were.
###573 You know, we took a couple laps, went down into the
###575 interior, tried to find her.
###577 And she came down the stairs from her house, and she was
###580 wearing like this white head wrap.
###583 We asked her, like, are you the Obeah woman?
###586 And she was totally offended by that label.
###589 
###596 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: And it was like, oh, oh, man.
###597 Joseph, maybe your shit is true.
###600 He had a vision, I guess, in the crystal ball--
###602 a woman with a white hat on.
###603 But behind that woman was a big, black demon.
###608 So I guess that's sort of like the shadowy shit that's behind
###614 the sort of magic and the healing.
###615 It's the demon behind.
###617 
###620 That woman was unhappy to be called an Obeah woman.
###624 I guess the stigma is, like, that strong.
###625 NATALIA SANCHEZ: It is really strong.
###626 You have really hard-core real-life consequences.
###631 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: It sort of like lurks just like a shadow
###633 over the whole practice.
###634 It's unspoken, but it exists.
###637 NATALIA SANCHEZ: Definitely.
###638 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: I tell you what, Natalia, it's been such
###640 a distinct pleasure having you join us
###642 for this last adventure.
###644 So I really wanted to thank you.
###646 Thanks for being such a good sport.
###647 NATALIA SANCHEZ: It was amazing.
###648 I got to see a side of Jamaica I would have never seen
###651 otherwise, so thank you.
###653
