###3 Hello FoodTubers, it's me Jemma and I'm here at Crumbs and Doilies HQ to show you how to
###8 make sunshine out of cake. We're gonna make a Lemon Meringue cake which
###12 is a lot like lemon meringue pie but way better! Pie's so last everything.
###19 We're gonna make that with lots of lovely lemons and sponge and we're gonna cover it
###23 in marshmallowy meringue icing and blowtorch it, so there's some danger involved.
###27 Right, so I've got 375g of caster sugar and I'm just gonna pop that in my mixer and add
###34 375g of butter. Which is really super soft. I'm gonna start that on a low speed then speed
###42 it up to a medium-high speed until it's really super white and fluffy. It's gonna take maybe
###47 like five minutes or so.
###53 It's gone really super pale and really super fluffy
###57 and I could just eat that right now to be honest because that's delish!
###61 You're gonna need 6 eggs. I'm using large, free range, organic eggs. With the mixer on
###66 a low speed, one at a time crack them into your mixer and give them a little mix before
###71 you add the next one.
###79 I'm just gonna stop it and give it a quick
###80 scrape just to make sure I've got all the bits and bobs out of the bottom.
###84 So give it one last whiz up. Whiz, whiz, whiz, whiz, whiz.
###90 Alright, I'm gonna put the lemon zest in now. Pop that out.
###94 And I've given these a wash. I used unwaxed lemons. The zest of the lemon sort of gives
###99 it a tang without the pang.
###103 I think I've got all my zest of my lemons
###106 now so I'm gonna whack my paddle back in.
###111 I've got 375g of self raising flour, which
###114 I've sifted and on a really low speed mix it just really gently.
###120 Here we go. Give its bum a little pat so that all the
###125 flours off the sides. I've got two tablespoons of milk and two and
###130 a half tablespoons of lemon juice. On a really low speed, pour it in at the same time.
###137 Get in there with your spatula and just make sure you scrape down the sides and all down
###142 the bottom so that any nuggets get mixed in as well.
###148 And I think we're ready to go. I've got three 8 inch sandwich tins which
###154 I've greased with butter and then dusted with flour. And then as evenly as possible, dish
###159 this lovely batter out into them. I'm just gonna use a palette knife just to
###167 smooth that all out so that you bake a nice, even cake.
###171 Right, so we've got the three layers for our cake ready to go in the oven and I've preheated
###175 my oven to 170°C and I'm gonna pop them in there for 25-30 minutes then we'll just check
###181 them after 25.
###189 While that's cooking I'm gonna make some Marshmallowy
###192 Meringue Icing. I've got a Bain-marie, which is a saucepan with a bowl over the top. The
###199 saucepan has about an inch of water in. You don't want to have too much because you don't
###202 want it to hit the bottom of the bowl when you put it on.
###205 So in my bowl I have a 175g of caster sugar and then I'm gonna add a 1/4 tsp of Cream
###213 of Tartar and a 1/4 tsp of salt. We've got 5 tbsp of Golden Syrup or if you're in the
###219 States you can use Corn Syrup. So that just goes in there as well. We have a tsp of Vanilla
###226 extract, then 2 tbsp of water. Right, that's that. And then we need 2 egg whites. So I'm
###235 just gonna separate them into my bowl. You need to start mixing immediately.
###243 And I'm using an electric whisk because this is gonna take quite some time. Your heat should
###250 be sort of medium to high and the speed of the mixer, make it quite fast as well.
###260 And this is gonna be almost white in the end. You don't wanna watch me doing this for 10
###264 minutes so let's skip ahead.
###268 It's pretty sticky stuff! Mmm it's really
###271 good actually, I'm just gonna.. mmm it is like a marshmallow, mixed with a meringue.
###278 It's exactly that. So that's all ready to go. We'll just pop that
###281 to one side until we're ready to use it. So we've done our topping and now we need
###284 to get our fillings. I have made a delicious lemon buttercream and it's
###288 exactly the same method as my vanilla buttercream video recipe. So just replace the milk and
###295 vanilla for lemon juice and if you want to see that video then click this blob.
###303 The other filling is lemon curd. If you want to learn how to make that then click this
###309 blob. Now! hahaha. If you don't have the time or the inclination
###315 to make your own lemon curd then don't despair, you can get these in most supermarkets. It's
###319 really tangy and lemony. Perfect for all this sweet stuff we're chucking on the cake.
###323 So, speaking of cake, we've got three layers out of the oven. They've cooled down.
###328 And you can tell they're ready because they are just kinda springing back. And I'm gonna
###331 just pop them out of the tins now. And if you wanna slide a palette knife underneath
###338 them just to loosen them up a bit. I'm putting them on grease-proof paper just so I can move
###341 them around really easily. Right, so I'm gonna take the tops off my cake
###345 just to make sure they are really super flat and all the crispy bits have come off and
###348 I'm using a cake leveller for that. You can use a serrated knife if you want but this
###352 is a little bit more accurate.
###359 You can eat this in secret or you can just
###361 throw it away. Or you can eat it in secret! I'm just gonna do that for all of the cakes.
###370 Now we've levelled our cakes off there's one more thing I'm going to do. Now you don't
###374 have to do this if you don't want to but I'm not a massive fan of the edge of the cake,
###379 the cake that's been in touch with the tin. Because it's where the cakes got the hottest
###385 and it's usually the driest part of the cake. So I like to get rid of that.
###388 I've got a 7 inch cake board and I'm gonna basically cut around each cake and then you
###393 can just get rid of that or you can sneak a little bit. Just to make sure it's nice,
###398 and it is nice.
###404 Right so our three layers are ready.
###406 I have a turntable. I did for many years decorate cakes without one so don't be alarmed if you
###413 don't have one. You can do it but it's just a little bit easier with one. I've also got
###417 an 8 inch board here for my 7 inch cake and I'm just gonna whack a little bit of buttercream
###423 on the bottom so that my cake sticks to it. On with our first layer. Just pick it up with
###430 both hands and whack it as in the middle as you possibly can and just squish it down a
###435 little bit just so it's nice and stuck. And first of all we're gonna use this lovely,
###442 delicious, creamy, lemon, zingy buttercream. Make sure it goes all the way to the edges.
###447 As level as possible. Then it's lovely, zingy lemon curd time. You don't wanna mix it in
###455 with the buttercream. You want it to kind of maintain the layer. And with this one you don't
###460 wanna go too close to the edge because you don't want this to be oozing out. Oooh but
###464 that looks nice doesn't it. It's like a giant fried egg, but much tastier.
###469 Right, so on with the next layer. And then do the same thing again for this layer.
###477 Ooooh Yeeeeah!
###481 Now it's time for the final layer and because
###485 I want this to be nice and straight I'm gonna turn this layer upside down because the side
###491 that it's been baked in the tin on is really straight, as you can see.
###497 Right, give it a little spin, make sure it's all straight and lovely. Clean it up at the
###504 sides. Right, so my cakes naked and delicious but
###509 it's gonna be even more delicious in a minute because we're gonna put the final pièce de
###514 résistance on top, which is the Marshmallowy Meringue icing.
###518 Gently, but assertively smooth it on. What you want is to cover your entire cake.
###528 I'm really slathering it on here which is absolutely fine because it's delicious.
###534 So, just generous and gentle, but assertive.
###541 Next it's the danger zone. Get yourself a
###545 blow torch and because we're dealing with fire I'm gonna use a baking tray to pop my
###551 cake on just so I don't melt my turntable.
###555 Ready... woooo.
###559 So what this is going to do is caramelise the sugar in your frosting so it's gonna get
###564 a really nice caramelly flavour and it's also gonna make it look really blimming awesome.
###568 So, very gently, from a little bit of a distance, not pointing the flame at the cameraman,
###577 lick it with the blowtorch.
###585 You can smell the burnt sugar coming off this
###588 cake. It's like caramel, it's so good. Right, so that's the top. Now we need to do the sides,
###595 so... This is where having a turntable comes in
###599 really handy.
###604 Alright, i think we're just about done. So,
###609 turn off your blow torch. We're done with the fire but we are not done
###615 with this cake. We need to eat this cake pronto. It's so good! Look at that!
###620 Wooooo! Ooooh caramelly.
###623 So there it is! My super-duper Lemon Meringue cake with Marshmallowy Meringue icing.

###644 Look at that!
###648 Oooooooh! Look at those lovely layers of the buttercream
###653 and lemon curd. I'm so excited about eating this.
###660 Mmmm tangy and sweet and marshmallowy and light and delicious. It's like sunshine.
###667 It's a slice of sunshine. C'mon guys, give us a hand!
###676 Mmmmmm
