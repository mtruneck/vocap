###19 THOMAS MORTON: Yugoslavia is best known as that big, goofy
###21 country from the '70s that turned into six little
###23 countries in the '90s amid an orgy of rape
###26 and nightmare war.
###28 The breakup of Yugoslavia led to a period of such heinous
###30 interethnic violence, including acts of outright
###32 genocide, it seemed amazing that they had ever been able
###35 to live together in first place.
###39 At the end of World War II, Josip Marshal Tito Broz united
###42 the six Balkan republics into a massive socialist
###44 federation, despite the fact that, historically, they all
###48 wanted to kill each other.
###50 When Tito died, the old ethnic tensions reawoke and the
###53 republic started to break away--
###54 first Slovenia, then Macedonia, then Croatia, then
###59 Bosnia, and eventually Montenegro, leaving Serbia the
###62 last republic to carry the torch for the old Yugoslavia.
###66 Oh yeah, Kosovo broke away too, if you
###68 consider that a country.
###70 It's been 10 years since the end of the wars, and since the
###72 man widely considered their architect, Serbian president
###75 Slobodan Milosevic, was bulldozed out of office.
###78 All the former Yugoslav republics have now applied for
###81 membership in the European Union.
###82 At the same time, the Balkans is still a byword for barbaric
###85 acts of violence, and the entire region occupies a sort
###88 of threshold state between Europe and, well, not-Europe.
###91 So we went to the Balkans to find out once and for all if
###93 Yugoslavians are just like you-and-me-goslavians.

###133 THOMAS MORTON: Hey, it's Thomas.
###134 We're in Yugoslavia-- or former Yugoslavia, I'm sorry.
###137 We're in Serbia right now.
###138 We rented an old Yugo for this trip.
###142 I don't think we realize quite how old it would be.
###146 We're going about 100 K right now-- so maybe 60-- and the
###151 car's rattling.
###152 It's almost like being in a moving massage chair.
###156 It's holding up pretty well except that the fuel gauge is
###158 literally doing this, so we have to guess when
###161 we're out of gas.
###163 And me and the passenger seatbelts are tied together.
###168 I forgot about that.
###169 
###174 So we're going to Yugoland, and that's a kind of a farm
###177 mixed with an amusement park.
###179 But it's supposed to capture the memory of Marshal Tito's
###184 Yugoslavia.
###186 Tell you one thing about Yugoland, they don't
###188 advertise very well.
###190 There were no signs on the highway for it.
###193 And it is in the middle of a very, very, very tiny village.
###198 Yugoland's website advertises it as a full service amusement
###201 park in northern Serbia, based on the former Yugoslavia.
###204 It has different sections for each of the old constituent
###207 republics, except for Kosovo, so we couldn't think of a more
###210 perfect place to get oriented for a road trip through the
###212 scattered remnants of old Yugoslavia.
###214 
###222 So this is Yugoland.
###223 It looks like it's kind of in the backyard
###225 of someone's house.
###227 I think we might have missed most of the action.
###231 This might be the [INAUDIBLE] committee.
###233 Sounds like stuff's still going on in the background.
###236 Yugoland seemed pleasant enough, if
###238 a bit old and rustic.
###242 Not a lot of teenagers so far, nor a lot of ladies.
###248 
###255 Blasko Gabric is Yugoland's founder, a Serbian printmaker
###259 turned Canadian turned eventual Yugoslavian superfan,
###263 and is generally what people of the region refer to as
###265 quite a character.
###266 
###283 THOMAS MORTON: Nine years and counting.
###285 THOMAS MORTON: Pretty good, yeah.
###286 
###307 THOMAS MORTON: Yugoland turned out to be less of an amusement
###309 park than a park park, and really less of that than a
###312 yard with some picnic tables and a lot of tipsy Serbians.
###315 Nevertheless, its amenities include a bandstand, soccer
###318 fields, a reflecting pool in the shape of the Croatian
###321 coastline, and a scale model of Slovenia's Mount Triglav.
###324 
###338 THOMAS MORTON: The most important amenity, however, is
###340 a fervent and unconditional love for Yugoslavia's late
###343 partisan leader, Marshal Tito.
###344 
###363 THOMAS MORTON: Marshal Tito's extremely beloved for a dead
###365 Communist dictator.
###367 Even coming from an American perspective, I always had a
###369 pretty vaunted impression of him.
###371 He was like the dictator who cares--
###373 minimal human rights violations, genuine popular
###376 support, and he was one of the only Communists with the balls
###379 to tell Stalin where to smoke it-- or where to stuff it,
###382 however that saying goes--
###383 and on top of that, he fucked Elizabeth Taylor, probably.
###387 So all in all, not a terrible guy to worship.
###390 The guest of honor at Yugoland was here as Tito's grandson,
###393 though we get the feeling the family charm may have skipped
###395 a couple generations.
###396 
###417 THOMAS MORTON: It's outside.
###418 
###440 THOMAS MORTON: Hey.
###441 
###446 THOMAS MORTON: The crown prince.
###447 
###458 THOMAS MORTON: A real who's who.
###460 US president anywhere here?
###461 BLASKO GABRIC: No.
###462 THOMAS MORTON: Carter?
###462 Or was it Reagan by that point?
###463 BLASKO GABRIC: No.
###465 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, there's Thatcher.
###467 THOMAS MORTON: She's somewhere.
###468 
###472 THOMAS MORTON: A few Elvis had a pretty big funeral.
###477 
###518 THOMAS MORTON: Oh yeah, a bunch.
###519 
###534 THOMAS MORTON: Yugoland's a pretty
###535 harmless exercise in nostalgia.
###537 What's creepy, though, is the part where it's mostly Serbs
###539 getting together in Serbia to celebrate their Yugoslav
###542 history, all while neatly stepping over the decade their
###545 country spent committing war crimes on Bosnia and Croatia
###547 and Kosovo.
###549 You also have to remember that during the '90s, when the wars
###551 were going on and Blasko was just getting into his
###554 Yugoslavian heritage, Serbia was still Yugoslavia--
###557 Milosevic's Yugoslavia.
###561 Go, Yugoslavia.
###562 
###567 While the Yugolanders sort of represent the feelgood version
###570 of the Balkans' past, basically retreading
###572 decades-old national propaganda ad nauseum, another
###576 group of Serbs have been barreling into the future with
###578 a trunk full of smuggled drugs, the
###580 soundtrack pumping Turbofolk.
