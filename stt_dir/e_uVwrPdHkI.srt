1
0:0:0,7 --> 0:0:3,58
but i have a sense something before your
side of public policy polling


2
0:0:3,58 --> 0:0:5,14
ranked number one


3
0:0:5,14 --> 0:0:6,529
in most accurate


4
0:0:6,529 --> 0:0:12,339
in determining or in predicting that
i'll come of the twenty twelve races


5
0:0:12,339 --> 0:0:13,66
is a very much of it


6
0:0:13,66 --> 0:0:18,9
credible polling organization and uh...
and as i said it would simply the most


7
0:0:18,9 --> 0:0:19,99
accurate


8
0:0:19,99 --> 0:0:20,61
in the last election cycle okay


9
0:0:20,61 --> 0:0:24,77
so at first we start with amazing
political facts a global warming is an


10
0:0:24,77 --> 0:0:26,49
approx


11
0:0:26,49 --> 0:0:30,83
illegally thirty seven percent of all
voters say yes


12
0:0:30,83 --> 0:0:34,1
fifty eight percent republicans say yes


13
0:0:34,1 --> 0:0:36,38
forty one percent of independence


14
0:0:36,38 --> 0:0:39,88
that sounds huge majority of republic
boaters


15
0:0:39,88 --> 0:0:40,81
who say that


16
0:0:40,81 --> 0:0:43,64
it's not this global warming is manmade


17
0:0:43,64 --> 0:0:44,919
global warming


18
0:0:44,919 --> 0:0:46,36
temperatures


19
0:0:46,36 --> 0:0:47,45
rising


20
0:0:47,45 --> 0:0:49,19
is a hulks


21
0:0:49,19 --> 0:0:50,8
but the tensions


22
0:0:50,8 --> 0:0:51,31
are rising


23
0:0:51,31 --> 0:0:55,84
the thermometers don't have a well-known
liberal bias


24
0:0:55,84 --> 0:0:57,92
that's a fact


25
0:0:57,92 --> 0:0:58,88
but probably


26
0:0:58,88 --> 0:1:2,97
thirty seven percent of american voters
and fifty eight percent or problems that


27
0:1:2,97 --> 0:1:5,38
buildings made up


28
0:1:5,38 --> 0:1:7,12
weather


29
0:1:7,12 --> 0:1:8,169
the sun mon


30
0:1:8,169 --> 0:1:11,54
carbon dioxide are all well known
liberal bias


31
0:1:11,54 --> 0:1:12,51
on real


32
0:1:12,51 --> 0:1:15,95
alright nasty and a political ignorance
that saddam hussein sa manila nine


33
0:1:15,95 --> 0:1:17,229
eleven others also fact


34
0:1:17,229 --> 0:1:18,57
he did not


35
0:1:18,57 --> 0:1:22,76
if you want you know as bush in cheney
they say he did not knoll person who


36
0:1:22,76 --> 0:1:24,67
knows any information about this


37
0:1:24,67 --> 0:1:27,24
liza saddam hussein was connected nine
eleven


38
0:1:27,24 --> 0:1:29,32
so for some erica's get it one


39
0:1:29,32 --> 0:1:33,42
uh... unfortunate percentage of the time
twenty eight percent of voters say yeah


40
0:1:33,42 --> 0:1:34,63
sam did it


41
0:1:34,63 --> 0:1:37,9
and thirty six percent of romney voters


42
0:1:37,9 --> 0:1:38,55
of course


43
0:1:38,55 --> 0:1:41,61
so we have slightly more inner
republican voters there saying the


44
0:1:41,61 --> 0:1:45,57
saddam hussein did now not not all
cooked a


45
0:1:45,57 --> 0:1:49,159
things a wrong here and in america who
are right on some of those top


46
0:1:49,159 --> 0:1:53,34
and i will conspiracy theories are off
so for example on j_f_k_


47
0:1:53,34 --> 0:1:56,9
fifty one percent of voters believe it
was a larger conspiracy but only twenty


48
0:1:56,9 --> 0:1:59,42
one percent say boswell act alone


49
0:1:59,42 --> 0:2:0,49
now there is


50
0:2:0,49 --> 0:2:3,64
tremendous evidence that oswald did not
act alone


51
0:2:3,64 --> 0:2:5,39
so that fifty one percent


52
0:2:5,39 --> 0:2:6,8
could be right


53
0:2:6,8 --> 0:2:9,649
there are conspiracies


54
0:2:9,649 --> 0:2:13,59
as a crime in we see the people get
together and do things and it's called a


55
0:2:13,59 --> 0:2:14,109
conspiracy


56
0:2:14,109 --> 0:2:17,79
could have happened in some cases that
have all the government of course a kind


57
0:2:17,79 --> 0:2:17,4
of


58
0:2:17,4 --> 0:2:19,539
in fact we've seen it over and over
right


59
0:2:19,539 --> 0:2:21,959
but it question is when how


60
0:2:21,959 --> 0:2:25,54
you can just pull it out as you're about
to see in some of the crazier things


61
0:2:25,54 --> 0:2:30,769
but just physical something stays as it
is not true or nikki betrayal on that


62
0:2:30,769 --> 0:2:32,739
here's our guests are c_f_o_


63
0:2:32,739 --> 0:2:35,999
how do people believe in the new world
order that there's a secret group of


64
0:2:35,999 --> 0:2:36,96
obese


65
0:2:36,96 --> 0:2:40,419
they're secretly will be your decisions
are willing to sell


66
0:2:40,419 --> 0:2:42,759
twenty eight percent of voters overall


67
0:2:42,759 --> 0:2:46,219
thirty eight percent of romney voters


68
0:2:46,219 --> 0:2:48,93
believe that there's a new will order


69
0:2:48,93 --> 0:2:51,279
the rockefellers of several are


70
0:2:51,279 --> 0:2:54,169
actually all the decisions


71
0:2:54,169 --> 0:2:57,4
that's a stunning number of crazy people


72
0:2:57,4 --> 0:2:59,83
look are their powerful and rich people


73
0:2:59,83 --> 0:3:3,519
who are more influential because they
did a lot of money to publishers accor


74
0:3:3,519 --> 0:3:5,489
missile as there are


75
0:3:5,489 --> 0:3:8,2
but they're not synonym builder for


76
0:3:8,2 --> 0:3:13,349
smoke-filled room go up by rubber ball
and at those or out those who turned up


77
0:3:13,349 --> 0:3:17,189
war was that that would in all of it all


78
0:3:17,189 --> 0:3:18,639
of broccoli but


79
0:3:18,639 --> 0:3:20,989
this is sufficient for news that they
did and that


80
0:3:20,989 --> 0:3:23,379
serious crazy way


81
0:3:23,379 --> 0:3:24,959
issued anti-christ


82
0:3:24,959 --> 0:3:27,79
thirteen percent of all to say yes


83
0:3:27,79 --> 0:3:32,389
twenty-three set around me berserk thing
about that that's more than one in five


84
0:3:32,389 --> 0:3:35,759
romney voters who believe that the
president the united states is the


85
0:3:35,759 --> 0:3:37,919
anti-christ


86
0:3:37,919 --> 0:3:39,839
the antichrist


87
0:3:39,839 --> 0:3:44,249
but we're not done with crazier


88
0:3:44,249 --> 0:3:47,289
twenty nine percent of voters believe
that bailey's exist


89
0:3:47,289 --> 0:3:49,49
now i'm dual long list here


90
0:3:49,49 --> 0:3:51,729
that's twenty nine percent for baghdad


91
0:3:51,729 --> 0:3:56,149
okay and by the way it was probably do
exist has on what you mean by aliens as


92
0:3:56,149 --> 0:3:57,739
their water on other planets


93
0:3:57,739 --> 0:4:2,2
they certainly could be marathi big
color shape guys who landed here not


94
0:4:2,2 --> 0:4:4,139
necessarily in fact


95
0:4:4,139 --> 0:4:7,76
haha twenty one percent was do think so
though because they say


96
0:4:7,76 --> 0:4:11,899
there you are folk ration roswell
celeste where one percent of us


97
0:4:11,899 --> 0:4:13,66
unless you find a believe


98
0:4:13,66 --> 0:4:16,979
even if there might be aliens that are
somewhere out in the universe


99
0:4:16,979 --> 0:4:18,769
now let's have a little bit of fun


100
0:4:18,769 --> 0:4:22,5
how bout number of people who believe in
bigfoot fourteen percent


101
0:4:22,5 --> 0:4:26,639
how about of people who believe that the


102
0:4:26,639 --> 0:4:29,429
u_s_ government allowed nine eleven i
happen


103
0:4:29,429 --> 0:4:32,559

is still alive


106
0:4:37,189 --> 0:4:39,9
six percent


107
0:4:39,9 --> 0:4:39,95
and uh...


108
0:4:39,95 --> 0:4:42,55
boaters who think the moon landing was
fake


109
0:4:42,55 --> 0:4:45,529
seven percent


110
0:4:45,529 --> 0:4:48,39
