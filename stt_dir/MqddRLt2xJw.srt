1
0:0:13,84 --> 0:0:22,46
Thank you very much; it's an honor to be here.
Let's pray together. Father I ask that you


2
0:0:22,46 --> 0:0:30,92
would now grant that the eyes of our hearts
would see, and that the taste buds of our


3
0:0:30,92 --> 0:0:44,97
souls would savor the supreme value of Jesus
Christ. And that being so confident and so


4
0:0:44,97 --> 0:0:57,579
satisfied in Him, we would have the courage
to lay down our lives, to take the gospel


5
0:0:57,579 --> 0:1:8,89
to the unreached peoples of the world, no
matter what it costs. And so make Yourself


6
0:1:8,89 --> 0:1:16,69
beautiful in our eyes. A steadfast love of
the Lord is better than life, better than


7
0:1:16,69 --> 0:1:24,729
life. I pray that every life in this room
would feel that, really believe it, drive


8
0:1:24,729 --> 0:1:33,39
it down into the marrow of our bones: that
You are more to be desired than life. I pray


9
0:1:33,39 --> 0:1:38,75
this in Jesus name, Amen.


10
0:1:38,75 --> 0:1:46,319
Standing beside the tomb of Lazarus, Jesus
said to Martha, "I am the resurrection and


11
0:1:46,319 --> 0:1:55,38
the life, he who believes in me though he
die, yet shall he live, and he who believes


12
0:1:55,38 --> 0:2:14,98
in me lives, shall never die." Do you believe
that? You will never die! Never! You won't


13
0:2:14,98 --> 0:2:28,599
die! Jesus said so. He who lives and believes
in me, will never die. Or chapter 6; that


14
0:2:28,599 --> 0:2:35,37
was chapter 11. Chapter 6: I am the bread
of life, whoever comes to me will not hunger,


15
0:2:35,37 --> 0:2:42,269
and whoever believes in me will never thirst.
This is the true bread that comes down from


16
0:2:42,269 --> 0:2:54,959
heaven. Which if one eats he will never die.
Have you eaten? If you have eaten of the bread


17
0:2:54,959 --> 0:3:0,28
of Christ, if you have come to Christ who
died for you, and rose again and lives triumphant


18
0:3:0,28 --> 0:3:9,7
if you have come to eat as the satisfaction
of your souls, you'll never die. He said so.


19
0:3:9,7 --> 0:3:30,95
You will never be dead. Or chapter 8, he who
keeps my word will never taste death. Ever.


20
0:3:30,95 --> 0:3:40,959
This is the root of love and courage that
can finish the great commission at the cost


21
0:3:40,959 --> 0:3:54,79
of our lives. Paul said, one of my favorite
passages in life, Philippians 1, it is my


22
0:3:54,79 --> 0:4:2,639
eager expectation and hope that I might not
at all be ashamed but for now as always Christ


23
0:4:2,639 --> 0:4:10,609
would be magnified in my body whether by life
or by death, for to me to live is Christ and


24
0:4:10,609 --> 0:4:22,22
to die is gain. Gain. Not death. It is not
gain to be dead. When you die you will not


25
0:4:22,22 --> 0:4:36,139
be dead. Whether by life, or by death, for
to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.


26
0:4:36,139 --> 0:4:42,669
To live in the flesh means fruitful labor
for me, which I shall choose, I do not know.


27
0:4:42,669 --> 0:4:51,63
My desire is to depart and to be with Christ.
For that is far better. So you wont be dead


28
0:4:51,63 --> 0:5:0,68
when you die, you will be far better. The
steadfast love of the Lord is better than


29
0:5:0,68 --> 0:5:13,68
life. No Christian dies. Ever. Death has become,
not a room into which you walk, not a dark


30
0:5:13,68 --> 0:5:27,509
field, it has become a door and the door is
paper-thin so micro thin it has no dimension.


31
0:5:27,509 --> 0:5:40,55
You go through it without a millisecond in
it. There will be no moment of death. You


32
0:5:40,55 --> 0:5:53,66
move from life to life with nothing in between.
You do not give your godly one up to see the


33
0:5:53,66 --> 0:6:1,289
pit, nor let your holy one see destruction.
You show me the path of life. In your presence


34
0:6:1,289 --> 0:6:6,96
is fullness of joy at your right hand are
pleasures forevermore. That's what's on the


35
0:6:6,96 --> 0:6:16,479
other side of this thing called dying. Pleasures
forevermore. There's nobody in this room who


36
0:6:16,479 --> 0:6:23,21
could offer me anything better. In fact, there's
no one in this room or in this world who can


37
0:6:23,21 --> 0:6:39,199
even conceive of anything better than fullness
of joy and pleasures at his right hand, forever.


38
0:6:39,199 --> 0:6:44,93
There's nothing fuller than full and there's
nothing longer than forever. So if you come


39
0:6:44,93 --> 0:6:52,19
to me and say I have a better deal for you
than following Jesus, I would say go ahead,


40
0:6:52,19 --> 0:6:58,449
try, and then you would say... and I would
say, no comparison. Because there isn't anything


41
0:6:58,449 --> 0:7:6,8
fuller than full and there isn't anything
longer than forever. And that's what I get


42
0:7:6,8 --> 0:7:12,539
in joy, in his presence the one who loved
me and gave himself for me and rose triumphant


43
0:7:12,539 --> 0:7:17,259
over the grave and reigns as a king in heaven
and will come again to make the world his


44
0:7:17,259 --> 0:7:30,53
own you can't improve upon it. Paul said in
1 Corinthians 3 don't boast in men all things


45
0:7:30,53 --> 0:7:38,159
are yours whether Paul or ____ or _____ the
world or life or death. Or things present


46
0:7:38,159 --> 0:7:43,639
or things to come all things are yours you
are Christ's and Christ is God's. Death is


47
0:7:43,639 --> 0:7:56,659
yours liberty students. Death is yours. It's
your servant. It stands ready like an ugly


48
0:7:56,659 --> 0:8:13,199
handmaiden with a rough hand to lead you into
everlasting pleasures. You will never die.


49
0:8:13,199 --> 0:8:20,909
You will spend now in fellowship with Jesus
and then on the other side intensified fellowship


50
0:8:20,909 --> 0:8:37,909
with Jesus, growing in joy forever and ever.
You cannot, and you will not, die. Here's


51
0:8:37,909 --> 0:8:48,5
the point: believing that, down into the marrow
of your bones, which a lot of you do not,


52
0:8:48,5 --> 0:8:57,89
I can tell, and you know, that you're scared
of little things, let alone, dying.


53
0:8:57,89 --> 0:9:3,32
But if God would be pleased to use your time
at Liberty, and this little piece of it right


54
0:9:3,32 --> 0:9:13,72
now to drive that truth down into the marrow
of your bones, it will become the root from


55
0:9:13,72 --> 0:9:22,85
which grows up a kind of radical love that
will carry you into the face of opposition


56
0:9:22,85 --> 0:9:34,75
at the risk of your life, to bring Christ
to the unreached peoples of the world. Confidence


57
0:9:34,75 --> 0:9:44,23
in fullness of joy and pleasures forevermore,
in the presence of Jesus, on the other side


58
0:9:44,23 --> 0:9:52,77
of this so called dying is the root of love
that is willing to lay down its life for the


59
0:9:52,77 --> 0:10:5,2
sake of the nations. This confidence that
you cannot die but only have increased pleasures


60
0:10:5,2 --> 0:10:23,42
produces martyrs who die in love, not martyrs
who kill in hate. And that's what I'm after.


61
0:10:23,42 --> 0:10:31,65
If you have a bible I invite you to turn to
Hebrews chapter 10. I'm going to spend the


62
0:10:31,65 --> 0:10:42,89
rest of our time in Hebrews. And I'm going
to try to prove from Hebrews the point that


63
0:10:42,89 --> 0:10:58,22
being totally, deeply, fully satisfied in
the reward of pleasures at his right hand,


64
0:10:58,22 --> 0:11:6,52
and fullness of joy forever, being deeply
satisfied in Christ as your supreme treasure


65
0:11:6,52 --> 0:11:15,6
forever is the motive power to lay down your
life in love for the good of the nations.


66
0:11:15,6 --> 0:11:20,6
That's what I'm going to try to prove, and
it's a very controversial statement because


67
0:11:20,6 --> 0:11:27,52
if you're studying philosophy you will know
that there have been historical, wise philosophers


68
0:11:27,52 --> 0:11:38,67
who have said, "That is a defective motivation...you
ought not do what's right for reward, you


69
0:11:38,67 --> 0:11:49,38
should do what's right because its right."
That is an atheist talking. Right for rights


70
0:11:49,38 --> 0:11:58,44
sake is an atheistic statement. Right for
Gods sake is a biblical statement. And when


71
0:11:58,44 --> 0:12:6,1
you analyze to the root what "for Gods sake"
means, it doesn't mean doing him a favor.


72
0:12:6,1 --> 0:12:13,17
It means doing yourself a favor for His glory.
You get the joy, he gets the credit. When


73
0:12:13,17 --> 0:12:20,19
you do right. That's what we're going to try
to prove because it's very controversial.


74
0:12:20,19 --> 0:12:25,92
So there are four or five passages. It's amazing
what you see in Hebrews, and I invite you


75
0:12:25,92 --> 0:12:36,29
to look first at 10:32: "Recall the former
days when after you were enlightened and you


76
0:12:36,29 --> 0:12:42,82
endured a hard struggle with sufferings."
So this is, they were converted, and as baby


77
0:12:42,82 --> 0:12:54,1
Christians they endured a hard struggle, sometimes
being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction,


78
0:12:54,1 --> 0:13:0,43
and sometimes being partners with those so
treated. If you got a picture of that on the


79
0:13:0,43 --> 0:13:9,49
platform this morning, right? We're not in
prison. Sayeed is in prison. Says this, right


80
0:13:9,49 --> 0:13:19,9
here, verse 33, sometimes being partners with
those so treated... what happened when they


81
0:13:19,9 --> 0:13:30,26
partnered, verse 34, you had compassion on
those in prison and you joyfully accepted


82
0:13:30,26 --> 0:13:39,49
the plundering of your property. So what happened
when they identified with the prisoners is


83
0:13:39,49 --> 0:13:46,45
that they got labeled as that kind of person
and people plundered their property, or confiscated


84
0:13:46,45 --> 0:13:52,83
their property. That's what happens when you
do compassion. That's what happens when you


85
0:13:52,83 --> 0:14:0,79
identify with the right. You might lose your
property. Somebody might scribble, 'go home


86
0:14:0,79 --> 0:14:8,1
Christian' on the wall of your dorm room,
or they might steal from you or they might


87
0:14:8,1 --> 0:14:11,78
malign you, or they might kill you.


88
0:14:11,78 --> 0:14:24,99
That's what happens in the cause of the mission.
And did you notice that unbelievable word


89
0:14:24,99 --> 0:14:35,5
in verse 34... joyfully. You had compassion
on those in prison and you joyfully accepted


90
0:14:35,5 --> 0:14:41,51
the plundering of your property. Now this
is what I'm after here; I'm after miracles.


91
0:14:41,51 --> 0:14:48,7
This is a miracle. None of you is like this,
in yourself. This is a miracle, somebody strips


92
0:14:48,7 --> 0:14:54,97
off everything you've got, rips off your car,
rips off your iPhone, rips off everything


93
0:14:54,97 --> 0:15:9,57
you've got and instead of seething with anger,
you rejoice. That's a miracle. That is crazy.


94
0:15:9,57 --> 0:15:21,55
How can that be? And the answer is in verse
34, at the end. Since you knew that you yourselves


95
0:15:21,55 --> 0:15:33,5
had a better possession and an abiding one.
Does that sound familiar? Better and abiding.


96
0:15:33,5 --> 0:15:45,97
Full and forever. In your presence is fullness
of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.


97
0:15:45,97 --> 0:15:57,41
You have a better possession. You have an
abiding forever possession. What is an iPhone?


98
0:15:57,41 --> 0:16:10,68
What's a car? What's a life? You will never
die; you will only have better, and abiding.


99
0:16:10,68 --> 0:16:15,3
That's where the joy came from, that's where
the compassion came from. That's where the


100
0:16:15,3 --> 0:16:21,3
visit to the prison came from. And that's
where it will come from today or it wont be


101
0:16:21,3 --> 0:16:28,32
Christian. These people didn't go to the prison
and joyfully accept the plundering of their


102
0:16:28,32 --> 0:16:32,16
property out of raw duty. It's the right thing
to do, that's what you're supposed to do;


103
0:16:32,16 --> 0:16:39,64
it says so in the book. That's not what the
text says. The text says they joyfully did


104
0:16:39,64 --> 0:16:45,94
it because they knew they had a better possession
and an abiding one. So that's text number


105
0:16:45,94 --> 0:16:55,99
one from Hebrews, here's number two. Chapter
11 verse 24...By faith Moses, when he was


106
0:16:55,99 --> 0:17:6,699
grown up refused to be called pharaohs daughter.
I'm sorry, refused to be called the son. That


107
0:17:6,699 --> 0:17:13,919
was a good thing not to be called Pharaoh's
daughter. That's another sermon, invite me


108
0:17:13,919 --> 0:17:25,11
back, I'll preach that one. Ok, lets try this
again. By faith Moses, when he was grown up


109
0:17:25,11 --> 0:17:34,57
refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's
daughter, choosing rather to be mistreated


110
0:17:34,57 --> 0:17:47,49
with the people of God. This is craziness
again right; this is just utter counterintuitive...choosing


111
0:17:47,49 --> 0:17:54,32
rather to be mistreated with the people of
God, than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures


112
0:17:54,32 --> 0:18:8,169
of sin. Fleeting. The whole world lives for
pleasure, right? The only difference is theirs


113
0:18:8,169 --> 0:18:17,49
is fleeting, ours is forever. That's not the
only difference. Ours is Jesus. So he checks


114
0:18:17,49 --> 0:18:25,99
out and weighs in the balance all that Egypt
could offer him, all that serving with a people


115
0:18:25,99 --> 0:18:32,159
under their approach of Christ could offer
him and he chooses the reproaches of Jesus.


116
0:18:32,159 --> 0:18:45,22
Why? Verse 26, he considered the reproach
of Christ, greater wealth. How are you doing?


117
0:18:45,22 --> 0:18:57,73
Is being made fun of part of your treasure?
If you love. He considered the reproach of


118
0:18:57,73 --> 0:19:12,59
Christ greater wealth than the treasures of
Egypt. How? For he was looking to the reward!


119
0:19:12,59 --> 0:19:19,72
That's where it came from. The thesis of this
message is if this reward, pleasures at your


120
0:19:19,72 --> 0:19:25,6
right hand, joy forevermore, goes down into
the marrow of your bones so that you know


121
0:19:25,6 --> 0:19:32,779
instead of being dead I will be with Christ
forever. Joy forever. That will become the


122
0:19:32,779 --> 0:19:38,98
root of all your love of the people of God
and the nations of the world, so that you


123
0:19:38,98 --> 0:19:47,289
can embrace reproaches for the Christ and
call them my wealth. This is just utterly


124
0:19:47,289 --> 0:19:51,259
different from the world.


125
0:19:51,259 --> 0:19:59,59
That's number two, here's number three. Verse
35, chapter 11, women receive back their dead


126
0:19:59,59 --> 0:20:10,33
by resurrection. Oh yes, I believe in miracles
of that kind too. And then, middle of verse


127
0:20:10,33 --> 0:20:23,61
35, some were tortured, refusing to accept
release, so that they might rise again to


128
0:20:23,61 --> 0:20:32,929
a better life. Oh, where'd that come from?
Where did that courage come from? No, I'm


129
0:20:32,929 --> 0:20:38,779
not going to renounce Him! I'm not going to
renounce Him to get out of jail. I would rather


130
0:20:38,779 --> 0:20:51,159
rise to a better life, a better abiding joy.
If you don't have that, you will cave. Keep


131
0:20:51,159 --> 0:20:57,87
going. Verse 36, others suffered mocking and
flogging and even chains and imprisonment.


132
0:20:57,87 --> 0:21:2,809
They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they
were killed with the sword. They went about


133
0:21:2,809 --> 0:21:10,899
in skins of sheep and goats destitute, afflicted,
mistreated, of whom the world was not worthy.


134
0:21:10,899 --> 0:21:20,7
What does that mean? Of whom the world was
not worthy. They're wearing skins and living


135
0:21:20,7 --> 0:21:32,509
in caves. Of whom the world was not worthy.
That means, they were a gift to the world,


136
0:21:32,509 --> 0:21:41,22
and the world didn't deserve the gift. So
that's what I want you to be. I want you to


137
0:21:41,22 --> 0:21:52,33
be a gift to the world. And the world doesn't
deserve you, it doesn't deserve you. You don't


138
0:21:52,33 --> 0:21:58,85
go to the world, to the Muslim world, the
Hindu world, the Buddhist world or the atheistic


139
0:21:58,85 --> 0:22:3,12
world or the secular world. You don't go to
the world because they deserved to have you


140
0:22:3,12 --> 0:22:18,86
come. You go because Jesus went and because
going there will lead you a full and abiding


141
0:22:18,86 --> 0:22:28,62
reward in the presence of Christ. Chapter
12, verses 1 and 2, this may be the most important


142
0:22:28,62 --> 0:22:37,72
one of all. I have two more. Therefore, chapter
12 of Hebrews, verses 1 and 2, therefore since


143
0:22:37,72 --> 0:22:44,299
we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses
let us also lay aside every weight and sin


144
0:22:44,299 --> 0:22:50,889
which cling so closely and let us run with
endurance the race that is set before us looking


145
0:22:50,889 --> 0:23:3,11
to Jesus. Were looking to Jesus, the founder,
and the perfector of our faith, who, for the


146
0:23:3,11 --> 0:23:14,249
joy that was set before him endured the cross,
despising the shame and is seated at the right


147
0:23:14,249 --> 0:23:18,24
hand throne of God.


148
0:23:18,24 --> 0:23:30,629
Now the reason this may be the most important
is because up until now I can imagine, thought


149
0:23:30,629 --> 0:23:40,669
its hard, somebody saying the motivation that
you're commending, namely looking to the reward


150
0:23:40,669 --> 0:23:56,299
as a sustaining and motivation power for love
is simply low and defective. It's a low motivation.


151
0:23:56,299 --> 0:24:4,929
To move through persecution and through death
into the presence of Jesus and experience


152
0:24:4,929 --> 0:24:15,389
His fullness of joy and pleasures forevermore.
That motivation for enduring this is low.


153
0:24:15,389 --> 0:24:22,61
If you are thinking that, you are on the brink
of blasphemy, because of verse two of Hebrews


154
0:24:22,61 --> 0:24:32,85
12. Because you are about to say, Jesus Christ
the Lord of the universe had a base low and


155
0:24:32,85 --> 0:24:45,789
defective motivation on the cross. And he
didn't. Here's his motivation: for the joy


156
0:24:45,789 --> 0:24:56,2
that was set before him. Therefore God has
given him the name which is above every name


157
0:24:56,2 --> 0:25:0,97
that at the name of Jesus every knee will
bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ


158
0:25:0,97 --> 0:25:7,35
is Lord to the glory of God the father. That
therefore at the beginning of verse 9 in Philippians


159
0:25:7,35 --> 0:25:15,69
2 is based on he was obedient unto death even
death on a cross he knew that. He knew that


160
0:25:15,69 --> 0:25:24,33
was coming. Rising triumphant over death gathering
millions and millions of people from every


161
0:25:24,33 --> 0:25:30,49
tongue and tribe and nation, surrounded by
them praising him forever triumphant over


162
0:25:30,49 --> 0:25:37,679
all these enemies he knew that was coming
and that hope stayed his hand and kept him


163
0:25:37,679 --> 0:25:47,99
on the cross. He despised shame for the joy
that was set before him. He looked at shame


164
0:25:47,99 --> 0:25:58,779
and he said, "I despise you." Make my day
shame. I put no stock in you. You don't govern


165
0:25:58,779 --> 0:26:7,95
me shame. I embrace you, I own you. Strip
me, kill me, bloody me, curse me, you mean


166
0:26:7,95 --> 0:26:23,149
nothing to me. I have a reward coming beyond
Sunday. For the joy that was set before him


167
0:26:23,149 --> 0:26:32,7
he endured the cross despising the shame and
was seated. So if Jesus was motivated to be


168
0:26:32,7 --> 0:26:47,96
and stay on the cross for the joy that was
set before him, you should be too. It is not


169
0:26:47,96 --> 0:27:5,639
a low motivation; it is the highest motivation
to want to be in the presence of God, in the


170
0:27:5,639 --> 0:27:18,419
fullness joy taking as many with you as you
can, is the highest of motivations. One more,


171
0:27:18,419 --> 0:27:32,659
chapter 13 verse 12 to 14, so Jesus also suffered
outside the gate in order to sanctify the


172
0:27:32,659 --> 0:27:43,919
people through his own blood. Therefore, let
us go to him, outside the camp and bare the


173
0:27:43,919 --> 0:27:54,96
reproach that he endured. For here we have
no lasting city, but we seek a city that is


174
0:27:54,96 --> 0:28:0,83
to come.


175
0:28:0,83 --> 0:28:11,9
So Liberty students, Jesus suffered outside
the gate to sanctify you that is to make you


176
0:28:11,9 --> 0:28:22,9
his own, to set you apart as a uniquely precious,
holy possession of his own. It's why he died.


177
0:28:22,9 --> 0:28:30,399
And now he says, join me because to do that
I had to go outside the gate to the cross


178
0:28:30,399 --> 0:28:38,549
and suffer and that's the way my mission will
be completed. You know, among the unreached


179
0:28:38,549 --> 0:28:46,169
peoples that are yet to be engaged and to
be reached, most of them don't want you to


180
0:28:46,169 --> 0:28:57,739
come. And if you don't have this mindset,
that will be enough reason not to go. But


181
0:28:57,739 --> 0:29:3,879
if you have this mindset, he will say well
the Great Commission didn't say go make disciples


182
0:29:3,879 --> 0:29:10,909
of all the nations except the ones that don't
want you to come. All is all. You go to the


183
0:29:10,909 --> 0:29:20,45
peoples, all of them. In there outside the
camp they're in the hard places, they're behind


184
0:29:20,45 --> 0:29:27,11
the hard cultures, they're behind hard languages,
and they're behind hard attitudes towards


185
0:29:27,11 --> 0:29:35,97
the west. Satan of the west. And we are called
to go, so what's left to be done is the hardest


186
0:29:35,97 --> 0:29:41,559
thing. You know, there are some wonderful
mission stories about arriving there and through


187
0:29:41,559 --> 0:29:46,649
it redemptive analogies of the whole tribe
gets converted and you're a hero. That's a


188
0:29:46,649 --> 0:29:57,6
rare story. A wonderful story, true story,
but a rare story. God has a people among all


189
0:29:57,6 --> 0:30:4,239
the peoples of the world and we go to call
them out. Call them out. And it will cost


190
0:30:4,239 --> 0:30:9,32
us our lives; it will cost many of you your
lives. I don't know, I mean you're a very


191
0:30:9,32 --> 0:30:14,36
young school, I don't know whether you have
a list of martyrs yet. But one day there'll


192
0:30:14,36 --> 0:30:24,46
be a wall; there'll be a wall here. And the
pictures will be there. They went. We did


193
0:30:24,46 --> 0:30:31,35
for the soldiers in the First and Second World
War. Most churches, old churches have plaques


194
0:30:31,35 --> 0:30:37,85
and their names are listed and they will be
listed in churches, they'll be listed in schools.


195
0:30:37,85 --> 0:30:43,789
And that's why I'm here; I want to recruit
martyrs who die in love, not martyrs who kill


196
0:30:43,789 --> 0:30:56,489
in hate. And I think that kind of love comes,
I know it comes, from being satisfied in Jesus,


197
0:30:56,489 --> 0:31:4,489
so deeply that you know you can't die. So
look at, finally, verse 14, here's the ground


198
0:31:4,489 --> 0:31:10,6
of going outside the camp and baring reproach
with Jesus. For here we have no lasting city,


199
0:31:10,6 --> 0:31:18,369
but we seek a city that is to come. The reason
we are willing to go outside the camp and


200
0:31:18,369 --> 0:31:24,47
suffer is because this world is not our home.
We seek a city that is to come. Now here's,


201
0:31:24,47 --> 0:31:30,69
I want to end on this because I know the kind
of school I'm talking to here, and I love


202
0:31:30,69 --> 0:31:40,239
what I see. Ninety percent of you, ninety
five percent of you are here growing in knowledge


203
0:31:40,239 --> 0:31:50,149
and skills that will enable you to serve this
city, called the city of man. The city of


204
0:31:50,149 --> 0:32:3,96
the world: this one. We have no lasting city.
That non-lasting city is Lynchburg, its America,


205
0:32:3,96 --> 0:32:14,559
it's the workplace. It won't last. And if
anybody were to take my message about loving


206
0:32:14,559 --> 0:32:21,659
our everlasting reward to mean you just skip
the city and go to that, you've totally missed


207
0:32:21,659 --> 0:32:31,2
the point. My point has been this: all the
students at Liberty aiming to pour your life


208
0:32:31,2 --> 0:32:39,179
into the city of man for her good, for her
everlasting good will serve her better if


209
0:32:39,179 --> 0:32:48,45
you love the other city more. If you love
the city that is to come, the Lord that is


210
0:32:48,45 --> 0:32:56,649
to come more than this city, you will serve
this city better. You'll be able to be so


211
0:32:56,649 --> 0:33:3,609
different from this city, so able to lay down
your life for the good, the everlasting good


212
0:33:3,609 --> 0:33:8,32
of this city that you will go to the hardest
places on the planet and the hardest peoples


213
0:33:8,32 --> 0:33:17,83
on the planet in order to make plain the value
of that other city, and that other King.


214
0:33:17,83 --> 0:33:28,9
Lets pray. Father in heaven, I ask now that
these passages from Hebrews, John 11, and


215
0:33:28,9 --> 0:33:43,149
John 6, and John 8 and 1 Corinthians 3, and
Psalm 16 would be like a double edged sword


216
0:33:43,149 --> 0:33:50,58
that penetrates into the hearts of everyone
in this room for the sake of finishing the


217
0:33:50,58 --> 0:33:56,139
Great Commission in the hardest places, among
the hardest peoples of the world no matter


218
0:33:56,139 --> 0:34:3,989
what it costs, because the steadfast love
of the Lord in better than life. I ask this


219
0:34:3,989 --> 0:36:3,989
in Jesus' name. Amen.
