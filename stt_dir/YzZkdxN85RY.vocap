###7 Five hundred years before Christ a young prince set out on a journey.
###13 He would travel through pain and suffering to reach nirvana
###16 - the everlasting bliss we all dream of.
###20 Symbol of peace
###23 Symbol of compassion, symbol of non-violence.
###30 He was the Buddha.
###33 He grew up in a palace surrounded by luxury.
###37 In his teens his privilege afforded him every indulgence
###43 But he gave all this up - to gain ultimate wisdom.
###51 He would travel the darkest corridors of his mind to come face to face
###55 with the devil inside him.
###59 He founded the first world religion,
###61 followed today by over 400 million people
###65 - a religion where meditation is used to reach
###68 a state of complete peace and happiness.
###72 Our own potential our own effort
###75 to know the ultimate reality.
###80 And the events of his life make up one of
###82 the greatest stories ever told
###84 - and the Buddha the world's most enduring icon.
###100 Two and a half thousand years after his death the Buddha's message lives on.
###106 The Dalai Lama
###108 - the spiritual figurehead of Tibetan Buddhism
###110 - passes on the teachings of the Buddha
###113 - continuing a practice that began the day he died.
###118 Buddhism has been adopted by many different cultures and has many interpretations.
###124 The Buddha's teachings of a higher mental calm
###127 and clarity are seen by some as a religion, others a philosophy, even a psychotherapy.
###133 Some people describe Buddhism is not a religion
###137 but Buddhism is science of mind.
###141 The Buddha's message is as relevant today
###143 as it was two and a half thousand years ago.
###146 What has made Buddhism so popular
###149 is that it is insightful and largely true that
###152 the Buddha discovered immensely important things.
###156 Unlike other religions, Buddhism,
###158 which centers on the mind, has no supreme God.
###161 Instead a great teacher - the Buddha or the Awakened One.
###167 It seems very almost intuitive to an age
###171 in which psychology becomes for many people an alternative to religion
###176 it's the means it's a therapeutic means
###179 to dealing with the problems of life
###181 and so it seems very accessible to many people.
###185 There are many representations of the Buddha
###188 - and Buddhists all have their own picture in their minds of what he was like.
###193 Some kind of vibration of complete peace, non-violence I think that must be there.
###204 Until little more than one hundred years ago
###207 the life of the Buddha remained unknown to the West.
###211 By the time the British colonized India
###213 - the country of the Buddha's birth - Buddhism had all but died out,
###218 destroyed by Hindu kings and Muslim invaders.
###222 The origins and the sites of the Buddha's life became lost to everyone.
###227 It wasn't until British colonial archaeologists
###230 began to explore Northern India that their discoveries
###233 began to root the Buddha's life in historical fact.
###238 In the 1860's,
###240 a series of archaeologists began to try
###243 and identify the sites associated with the life of the Buddha.
###248 By the 1890's many of these sites
###251 had been successfully identified within the Ganges area,
###256 but that time two of the great sites connected with Buddhism were still missing,
###261 the site of Lumbini, where the Buddha had actually been born,
###264 and the site of Kapilavastu which was the childhood home of the Buddha.
###270 The area to the north of the Ganges was less well known,
###273 partly because of the very thick jungle there,
###276 tigers as well as malaria.
###281 It took a breakthrough discovery to unlock
###283 the story of the Buddha's origins.
###288 In a remote village across the border in Nepal a pillar was discovered.
###294 A British expedition was sent out to decipher its inscription.
###299 The script is the early Brami script
###301 and the language is a local vernacular language
###304 of Northern India and indeed the inscription itself depicts
###309 that this is where the Buddha, the enlightened one was born.
###317 This was the first piece of evidence to suggest that the Buddha
###320 was not just a legendary figure - he actually existed.
###325 Ancient Buddhist texts had named the Buddha's birthplace as Lumbini
###329 and now the archaeologists had it located on the map.
###335 Now they tried to find the Buddha's childhood home
###338 - an ancient city named in the texts as - Kapilavastu.
###343 It was apparent that it was located to the west
###346 perhaps 10 or 15 kilometers to the west of Lumbini
###350 and that is where the search began to intensify.
###354 Expeditions uncovered two possible sites
###356 for Kapilavastu - one in India the other in Nepal.
###362 For a hundred years archaeologists have argued over them.
###366 New research by Dr Coningham and his team
###369 suggests the ancient city lay at modern day Tilaurakot - in Nepal.
###375 It's an extremely exciting site because it is so well preserved,
###379 we conducted that a series of geo physical surveys
###383 and we then identified a series of roads laid out and it became a clear
###389 that the entire city in its final phrase had been laid out on a girded pattern.
###397 At its centre lay a palace.
###399 It is here that the Buddha's story begins.
###406 Two and a half thousand years ago
###408 Northern India was divided up into Kingdoms and republics.
###413 The Buddha's father - Sudhodana
###415 - was the elected chieftain of the Shakya tribe.
###419 He ruled his kingdom from his palace near the foothills of the Himalayas.
###425 His queen was called Maya.
###428 Legend tells that on the night
###430 of the full moon she had an extraordinary dream.
###434 It told that a special Being known
###436 as the Buddha was about to be born again on earth.
###441 The legend goes on that Four Guardian deities of the world
###445 carried Queen Maya up to the Himalaya mountains in her bed.
###449 They anointed her with divine perfumes and decked her with heavenly flowers.
###454 A white elephant with six tusks descended from heaven,
###458 carrying a lotus flower in its trunk, and entered her womb.
###462 The Buddha would be born of Maya.
###467 If one looks at this story of the Buddhist conception and compares it
###470 to say the conception story of Jesus, where you have angels appearing.
###476 I suppose a similar basic idea is there. That the forces which are beyond
###484 are signaling that something great is happening.
###487 Its said that the Buddha chose the time and the place that he would be reborn.
###494 The baby boy was named Siddhartha - meaning 'every wish fulfilled'.
###498 But his mother fell ill after giving birth and died a few days later.
###503 Siddharta was brought up by his aunt.
###507 The family summoned Brahmin priests
###509 and then a trusted palace soothsayer to predict the young prince's future
###514 We're told that he noticed
###515 the auspicious signs of a great being upon Siddhartha's body,
###519 including the mark of a wheel upon his feet.
###523 It's said that the Buddha was born
###526 with certain marks on his body the so called 32 marks of a great person.
###531 They are seen as appearing on the body of two kinds of people.
###535 One who will become the Buddha and one who will become a world Emperor.
###539 His father was quite keen on the idea
###542 that his son would become a great political leader.
###544 So this is why it is said that he cosseted his son,
###548 to prevent him seeing things which might send him in a religious direction.
###559 Everyone knew the signs meant Siddharta was exceptional, especially the King.
###565 But as he watched his
###566 inquisitive young son growing up he worried about these predictions
###570 - that one day his son would abandon the palace and become the spiritual leader
###574 rather than stay to become chief of the Shakyas.
###584 As Siddhartha grew older his father was delighted to see the boy's exceptional
###588 ability at the princely sports of fencing, wrestling and archery.
###594 But he also noticed that Siddharta was a deeply thoughtful and curious child.
###599 He appeared to be more interested in trying to understand
###602 the nature of the world around him than in military pursuits.
###607 For the King these were the most important skills
###610 young Siddharta should learn if he was to become a leader of men.
###615 Siddhartha was expected to become
###617 the future King and defender of Kapilavasthu
###620 - one of the very first cities in Northern India.
###625 The Palace where Siddhartha grew up has long since crumbled away.
###630 Its mud and wood construction
###631 have left nothing for archaeologists to examine.
###635 But more durable materials have recently been discovered at Tilaurakot.
###639 We cut a trench 3 meters by 3 meters and eventually
###643 We had a very clear sequence at the site
###645 and then we began to be somewhat surprised by identifying a material known as
###651 painted greyware which is basically a flat bowl with black paint.
###657 This tiny fragment has huge significance.
###660 Dr Coningham believes it was made in the 5th Century BC
###664 - at the time Siddhartha was growing up in the palace.
###668 What we have is a centre of small industry - We are probably dealing with a settlement
###673 that we would even hesitate to call a city today
###676 - centered around a large courtyard belonging to the ruler.
###681 And the majority of the population living in the agrarian hinterland.
###690 It was this hinterland,
###691 lying beyond the city walls that fascinated Siddhartha.
###696 So when at the age of nine
###697 his father allowed him out to celebrate the annual ploughing festival
###701 he eagerly participated.
###705 His first glimpse of reality beyond
###707 the palace walls would open a door for Siddharta to a new vision of the world
###711 and would become the turning point of his life.
###720 The story recalls that he watched a farmer ploughing.
###723 He saw the toil and effort, struggle and repetition of this back-breaking work,
###728 something he'd never seen in the palace.
###736 He managed to slip away from the festivities and be alone.
###740 This first experience of real life had a profound effect upon him.
###745 To everyone else this was a celebration
###748 - but to Siddhartha it symbolized something quite different.
###756 He felt his mind leading him into a contemplative state.
###762 He watched the plough as it cut
###763 and parted the ground and noticed a bird eating a freshly unearthed worm.
###769 He asked himself why living beings have to suffer in this way.
###774 If the farmer had not been ploughing the bird would not have eaten the worm.
###779 He realized that everything was connected and that all actions had consequences.
###785 This simple observation would become
###787 one of the corner stones of his teachings - known as karma.
###792 As Siddharta's mind focused on these profound thoughts he slipped
###796 into a trance or jana - a mental state which would become
###800 his first step on the road to enlightenment.
###803 He was sat under a tree
###805 and he was just focusing on the plough going through the earth.
###809 And its said while doing that he fairly Naturally went into
###813 a meditative state called a first Jana. Which was very very joyful and happy.
###818 And which he later uses as part of his spiritual path.
###822 The connection to Buddhist meditation
###823 is the focusing on something which has a calming centering effect.
###827 Possibly also the idea of compassion
###829 for the worms being killed as the plough went through the earth.
###836 So I suppose one would see this as just part of his rather special nature.
###842 The young prince's behavior deeply unsettled the King.
###846 Brahmanism - the religious tradition of the time
###849 - insisted that sons should follow in the footsteps of their fathers.
###854 One of the things that I think makes this narrative so powerful is,
###858 again we can imagine this scene of his father
###865 trying to protect his son encountering any suffering.
###868 Now the reason for doing this is that there has been a prophesy that/
###872 he'll either become a universal monarch
###874 or he'll become a renunciant who will gain enlightenment.
###879 His father of course wants him to become a king to follow in his footsteps.
###886 As Siddhartha grew up
###888 his father did all he could to tempt him to stay inside the palace.
###892 He tried to create a perfect and seductive world for him to live in.
###907 As was Customary for a prince, Siddhartha was offered beautiful maidens
###911 to entertain him with music and to pleasure him with their physical beauty.
###929 When Siddhartha reached the age of sixteen
###931 the King even found him a beautiful bride - Princess Yasodhara.
###938 Siddharta had to compete for her hand
###940 and the King was delighted how skillfully his son fought off the competition.
###946 The King began to convince himself
###948 that palace life was beginning to suit his son at last.
###953 But this was wishful thinking
###955 and Siddhartha pestered his father to allow him out of the palace.
###960 Unable to refuse his son's wishes any longer,
###963 the King desperately set about
###965 clearing every eyesore from the surrounds of the palace.
###972 Like a Hollywood film set, the sick, the poor and the old were all deleted
###977 from the fantasy presented to the young prince.
###983 Despite his father's efforts,
###985 Siddhartha's first taste of the outside world would reveal stark realities.
###992 With the naivety of a child he set out with Chana,
###995 his charioteer, as his guide.
###1002 The prince would make four journeys and see four signs
###1006 - as predicted by the palace fortune teller.
###1010 Early Buddhist texts place great importance on this point in the story
###1014 as each journey would reveal to Siddhartha
###1017 an aspect of life which had been deliberately hidden from him.
###1023 On his first trip Siddhartha went out into the country,
###1027 away from his father's influence.
###1030 He noticed an old man painfully making his way through a village.
###1035 He asked Chana what was wrong with the man
###1038 and Chana explained the process of ageing to him.
###1044 Siddhartha was alarmed
###1045 when he learnt that ageing is inescapable and happens to us all.
###1054 For Siddhartha,
###1055 reality was beginning to unveil a cruel picture of the world.
###1059 - Where misfortune and suffering appeared to dominate every aspect of life.
###1068 The second sign was soon to follow
###1070 when Siddhartha noticed a sick man, his features twisted with disease.
###1077 He asked Chana if anyone could become sick and again he was shocked
###1081 when he learnt the brutal truth that we all can.
###1088 The protective wall of fantasy around him was beginning to crumble.
###1092 And the further the young Prince ventured the more of life's horrors confronted him.
###1099 Now he saw a corpse, bound in linen,
###1102 being carried to the funeral pyre - and the story records that Siddhartha
###1106 is appalled to discover not only that all men are mortal,
###1110 but also that it was a Brahmin belief that after death we are all reborn
###1114 - to suffer and die time and time again.
###1121 There seemed no end
###1122 and no solution to life's miserable and inevitable cycle.
###1128 The Buddha's life is an allegory because the most important point in it is
###1134 that here is a young man who is brought up with every luxury
###1139 and he realizes that isn't enough because he has a shock.
###1143 He has a shock because for the first time he encounters old age,
###1149 disease and death.
###1153 It's not plausible to think that growing up as an intelligent youth
###1158 he wouldn't have known anything about it. The point is rather to
###1163 convey the tremendous impact that coming face to face with
###1167 these fundamental facts of human existence, has and must have upon us,
###1173 and that it's urgent that we do something about it.
###1180 But it was the fourth sign that would definitively point to Siddharta's future
###1185 - a man wearing a simple robe with a begging bowl before him.
###1191 Why should anyone want to give up the pleasures of the world
###1193 to wander the countryside, begging? Asked the prince.
###1197 Chana explained that the man had renounced such pleasures in order to confront reality
###1203 and seek answers to this painful existence.
###1209 The account of the four signs I see as quite an effective story way
###1215 of putting certain existential realizations we all know we are going to get old
###1220 we all know we are going to get sick we all know we are going to die
###1222 in our heads but its very different to sit down on day
###1226 and realize here no is not just other people who get old sick and die
###1231 its I'm going to get old I'm going to get sick and I'm going to die
###1236 and I think the story accounts are trying to portray
###1240 that moment of existential realization where you see it for the first time
###1245 you are going to die and you know it and you taste it.
###1249 When Siddartha returned to the palace after this fourth journey
###1253 his mind was reeling with his new understanding of the world.
###1261 The fruits and flowers around him would rot and wither away.
###1265 Even the walls of the palace would one day crumble.
###1271 His wife had just given birth to a beautiful child.
###1274 But they would both one day grow old,
###1276 become ill and die. It was inevitable.
###1282 He had learnt the meaning of impermanence and saw it in everything around him.
###1288 Siddharta knew he had to leave his family
###1290 to seek answers to the questions that tormented him,
###1294 even though this meant abandoning his wife and son.
###1298 Against the tradition of his family and the Brahmin religion,
###1301 Siddhartha left home to find his own answers to life's suffering.
###1309 One story recalls
###1311 how a hypnotic mist sent the guards to sleep
###1314 allowing him to escape with Chana, through the Eastern Gate of the palace.
###1332 It is said that beside the river Anoma, he removed his jewellery,
###1336 exchanged his robes for rags and cut off his long hair.
###1341 He asked Chana to carry them back to the palace.
###1348 Siddhartha was alone for the first time.
###1350 He had at last escaped the false world of palace life
###1354 where suffering had been swept out of sight.
###1358 Now he needed to come face to face with reality,
###1361 if he was ever to find a solution to the pain of existence.
###1368 Siddhartha was confronted by suffering on a scale
###1371 he'd never seen before when he arrived in the cities.
###1378 And within those cities people were being thrown together,
###1380 at times there was perhaps an increase in disease and suffering.
###1384 Some people have seen this as a particular trigger
###1387 for the Buddha's emphasis on suffering.
###1390 It accentuated a universal problems that any human being in any society faces.
###1402 Siddhartha realized that
###1403 if he was to find an answer to the suffering surrounding him,
###1407 he would have to challenge
###1408 the Brahmin religion under which everyone lived.
###1412 What the Brahmins had was sacred knowledge this sacred knowledge
###1418 centered on knowing certain texts called the Vedas
###1422 the word Veda itself simply means knowledge and the implication is that
###1426 that was the only knowledge which was really worth having.
###1431 With their sacred knowledge,
###1433 Brahmin priests oversaw every stage of life,
###1436 from birth to death.
###1442 Their blessing was essential
###1443 but their knowledge could only be handed down to their sons.
###1448 The position of Brahmin families remained assured
###1451 - until a new wave of thinkers began to challenge this.
###1455 It was a time when Brahamism,
###1458 early form of Hinduism was being questioned,
###1463 it was a little bit like the time of the ancient philosophers
###1467 such as Plato and Socrates in Ancient Greece.
###1471 People debating arguing with people and
###1474 the Buddha tried to cut a way through that.
###1478 He described the context as a welter of views a jungle of views.
###1485 As Siddhartha explored this jungle he realized that
###1488 the solution to life's suffering needed to be available to everyone,
###1493 rather than an exclusive few - like the Brahmin tradition.
###1497 The Buddha disagreed with the Brahmins and he said one does not become a Brahmin
###1503 by birth one becomes a Brahmin
###1506 by living well one does not become an outcast
###1510 by birth one becomes an outcast by living badly.
###1514 Now that's a wonderful and important thought its like saying in our society
###1521 a true gentleman is not one who is born into a particular family
###1525 but one who behaves properly.
###1530 Siddhartha traveled further on his search into Northern India.
###1535 He was looking for an alternative way of life
###1538 that attempted to overcome the suffering he'd seen around him.
###1545 He was interested in all the new philosophies
###1549 but he wanted to go further - to reach deeper into his mind.
###1554 He now decided to focus on the technique of meditation
###1557 and sought out the leading gurus of the day.
###1561 There been broadly speaking two kinds of meditation in ancient India.
###1566 Which consisted in putting yourself under various kinds of pressure
###1570 by controlling your breathing or sometimes fasting
###1575 or undergoing other forms of discomfort
###1579 and the aim is really to obtain what we call altered states of consciousness.
###1586 So they would think that they had climbed to very high plains in the universe.
###1592 They're not taking this literally,
###1594 its not that they think that they go five thousand feet up in the air,
###1597 so to speak but they think that there are certain planes which become more
###1601 and more abstract such things as the plane of infinity of space
###1607 and that's followed by the plane of infinite consciousness as you got
###1610 and then the plane of infinite nothingness,
###1613 these were the sorts of things
###1614 the Buddha definitely must have learnt from his teachers.
###1618 It is said that Siddhartha,
###1619 so excelled at mediating that he attracted a group of five followers
###1624 and his teachers asked him to stay on and take over their schools.
###1629 But Siddhartha decided that this practice alone was not
###1631 the answer to the problem of suffering and rebirth or reincarnation.
###1637 He set out to explore other techniques - this time focusing on his body.
###1642 So he then goes to try another method which is harsh asceticism.
###1648 This involved things like fasting, not washing,
###1652 meditations where you hold your breath for a very long time
###1656 and its very forceful willful way.
###1666 Ascetics may starve and even mutilate themselves.
###1670 For them the physical body is a barrier to spiritual liberation.
###1677 By shedding their attachment to the body
###1680 they will cleanse the mind and liberate the soul.
###1688 Siddhartha tried to achieve this state of liberation.
###1692 He fasted for so long his life hung by a thread.
###1697 'All my limbs became like the knotted joints of withered creepers,
###1702 my buttocks like a bullocks hoof,
###1704 my protruding backbone like a string of balls,
###1708 my gaunt ribs like the crazy rafters of a tumbledown shed.
###1713 My eyes lay deep in their sockets,
###1716 their pupils sparkling like water in a deep well.
###1719 As an unripe gourd shrivels and shrinks in the hot wind,
###1724 so became my scalp.
###1733 Just as Siddhartha was about to die of starvation a young girl
###1736 saved his life by giving him a bowl of rice and milk.
###1742 He now realized that if he starved himself again
###1745 he would simply die having achieved nothing.
###1751 And the story says that he is living on one grain of rice a day.
###1753 He's practically starved himself to death
###1756 and realizes that disciplining the body through extreme self renunciation,
###1765 aestheticism inflicting pain upon the body that doesn't solve the problem.
###1774 When his five followers saw Siddhartha
###1776 had given up his fast they lost faith in him.
###1780 They no longer believed he had the strength
###1782 to live up to his spiritual convictions and abandoned him.
###1786 He feels he tried what's on offer,
###1789 they haven't worked,
###1791 and its at this stage that he remembers meditation
###1794 that he went into spontaneously in his teens/ and he thinks mm,
###1798 maybe that is a way through to awakening because its not taken up the desires
###1804 of the body but it is very joyful and happy.
###1809 By chance Siddharta came across a musician tuning his sitar.
###1814 When the string was too slack it would not play.
###1817 When it was too tight it snapped.
###1820 Somewhere in the middle lay tuneful harmony.
###1825 Siddhartha realized that
###1827 this simple observation signified something of great importance.
###1832 It was the middle way that would lead him to the state of mind he was looking for
###1836 - to a state of tuneful harmony - enlightenment.
###1841 But how could he achieve it?
###1844 And the way that Buddha eventually uses is what one could call mindfulness
###1849 or awareness of the body,
###1850 which neither ignores it nor tries to forcefully master it,
###1854 but it's a kind of middle way.
###1860 The middle way led Siddhartha through the countryside.
###1863 He had been traveling for six years, He had experienced pain and suffering
###1869 and had stretched the boundaries of his mind.
###1872 But he'd still not found the inner peace and harmony he was searching for.
###1877 The state of absolute wisdom and everlasting bliss known as Enlightenment.
###1887 Siddhartha arrived at Bodh Gaya.
###1890 Here his torment would end.
###1895 He sat down beneath a tree and vowed not to leave until he had reached ENLIGHTENMENT.
###1911 'Flesh may decay, bones may fall apart,
###1915 but I will never leave this place until I find the way to enlightenment. '
###1924 He's no longer giving himself a hard time,
###1927 he's not stressing himself unbearably, he's not undergoing anything painful,
###1933 he thinks, well life is painful without taking the trouble to make it more painful,
###1938 but let me just calmly think things out, think of how life works.
###1946 He starts to focus the mind by attention to the slow movement of the breath coming
###1954 and going out a refined sensation which exists in the body
###1959 just around the nose in a way which starts to lead to the mind quietening,
###1968 stilling, settling, gathering, purifying.
###2023 Siddhartha's mind was now so focused
###2026 that he could successfully enter the darkest reaches of his unconscious.
###2032 It was now that he would face his final and greatest torment.
###2036 The demon Mara - the Lord of Ego and illusion appeared before him.
###2041 He could make any horror real in Siddhartha's mind.
###2046 It's very important to remember that Mara this demon king
###2049 is not like the Christian Satan because he isn't a tempter
###2054 and he isn't any kind of counterpart to God,
###2057 he is purely psychological forces which we have within us,
###2067 Mara unleashed an army of demons to attack Siddhartha.
###2072 They fired flaming arrows at him.
###2080 But mid flight Siddhartha turned them into lotus blossoms
###2084 and they fell harmlessly around him.
###2095 Having failed Mara then tried to seduce Siddhartha
###2099 with his tempting daughters.
###2107 He's assailed by the demon king who is the same time death
###2111 and desire very Freudian that in a way desire is death,
###2116 death is desire and in fact the Demon king offers him his three daughters
###2121 who are both passion or lust and aversion where it is equally bad
###2129 if you shy away from this and say it is disgusting
###2133 you are also a slave to passion
###2136 - and he can be completely calm and indifferent
###2138 and just gaze at them without any feelings of attraction or repulsion.
###2146 The faces of Mara's daughters began to rot before Siddharta's eyes.
###2151 The evil daughters then disappeared into the earth.
###2157 It is in fact you could say the Buddha's very recognition
###2161 that Mara is an aspect of himself
###2165 the total recognition of that is his enlightenment.
###2170 The earth is said to have trembled as he dispelled the devil.
###2174 Siddhartha, now aged 35, passed through four Janas
###2178 to reach enlightenment
###2179 and become the Buddha - or Awakened One.
###2185 He then spent 7 days beneath the tree in a meditative state of absolute bliss.
###2195 This is seen as a state where the mind is incredibly refined and sensitive,
###2200 and an image might be of a lake, which is totally still,
###2204 which would register even an insect on the surface.
###2209 So this is seen as a state where the mind is very,
###2211 very powerful as an instrument of knowledge, very sensitive.
###2215 In this highly attuned state,
###2218 the Buddha saw way to escape
###2219 the inevitable cycle of old age sickness and death.
###2224 He realized that if we remove desire
###2227 we can remove dissatisfaction and suffering from our lives.
###2232 A key cause of the painfulness
###2235 and frustration of life is craving kind of demanding desires.
###2240 So There's a general mismatch
###2243 between how you want things to be and how they actually are.
###2247 The insight the Buddha attained beneath the tree was the birth of Buddhism
###2252 - a religion followed today by 400 million people.
###2258 The Buddha summed up his wisdom in four noble truths
###2261 which are the foundation of all Buddhist beliefs
###2267 The first noble truth recognized that there is suffering in life.
###2272 The second diagnosed the cause of that suffering - desire.
###2277 In the third truth, like a doctor,
###2279 the Buddha revealed that there was a cure for desire.
###2283 And in the fourth noble truth he gave the prescription
###2287 - how to cure the illness and achieve Enlightenment or Nirvana.
###2292 The ultimate aim was to reach a state of mind completely free of craving,
###2297 ignorance, greed, hatred and delusion,
###2300 thereby free of all the causes of future rebirth
###2305 when an enlightened person dies they're seen as going beyond rebirth
###2309 to a state beyond if you like space and time and not coming back
###2313 so that is seen as a state of liberation.
###2319 The Buddha would further teach that morality, meditation and wisdom
###2324 were the stepping stones to enlightenment.
###2330 He would dedicate the rest of his life helping others to follow this path
###2335 - towards freedom from suffering.
###2337 As his followers grew in number he went on to set up a school or Sangha
###2345 Today a temple stands beside a descendant
###2348 of the very tree under which the Buddha became enlightened.
###2355 The monks here have become a living library of the Buddha's teachings.
###2363 Chanting his sacred words beneath the Bodhi tree of Enlightenment
###2367 is seen by Buddhists to give special power to their practice.
###2373 The chief monk is responsible
###2374 for preserving this tradition at the temple.
###2377 The most important thing is the practice of his teachings.
###2382 Practice diligently, be ever mindful.
###2388 So now I say I explain Buddhism in two words,
###2395 practice mindfulness.
###2399 The path to enlightenment begins with the focusing of the mind
###2402 and following a number of commandments.
###2406 Morality, meditation and wisdom.
###2411 So not to kill, not to steal,
###2415 not to have any sexual misconduct,
###2419 not to tell a lie and not to have indulge in intoxicating drinks or intoxicants.
###2431 This was the way of life established by the Buddha in the very first sangha.
###2439 After eight years
###2440 he went back to the palace and the family he'd abandoned.
###2445 We're told his father now forgave
###2446 the Buddha for the deep hurt he had caused.
###2450 King Sudhodhana now realized the importance of his son's quest.
###2455 His stepmother even begged to join his sangha
###2458 and she went on to become history's first nun.
###2461 The Buddha is justified in the eyes of all Buddhists of even leaving his wife
###2466 and child to go on his solitary journey to try and find what the solution
###2473 to life's problems is and how life should be lived
###2476 and for him how life should be lived is the question infinitely more important
###2483 than having any possessions or even the company of loved ones.
###2489 The Buddha was to abandon his family again. He set out to teach, for forty years
###2496 - passing on to his followers the wisdom he had attained beneath the bodi tree.
###2501 But before he left he ordained his son as a monk.
###2508 The Buddha encouraged his followers to live together in a monastery or Sangha
###2512 - to help them focus on the path to enlightenment.
###2517 Some people become a monk purely to meditate,
###2521 purely to practice meditation, purely to practice the life of a recluse.
###2529 Some become a monk to work for the propagation of the religion.
###2536 Monks from all over the world
###2537 come to live in monasteries established around the temple of the Bodi Tree.
###2542 Non-Monks or lay Buddhists, come here too, to learn from them.
###2549 Monks must be celibate and give up every selfish desire.
###2554 And that is the one part of the training to get rid of self tendencies,
###2562 tendencies to always think about yourself
###2564 and put yourself fully in the context of the community of the sanga
###2571 Then when all the sacrifices have been made the hard work begins
###2576 - committing long chants or mantras to memory.
###2580 Mantras such as this have a purpose
###2583 - they are designed to test the monk's memory,
###2585 concentration and commitment to the Buddha's teachings.
###2591 Over the centuries his message has evolved into a number of different traditions,
###2596 with their own interpretations and monastic practices.
###2602 But the Buddha taught that lay people
###2603 can also follow the path to eternal bliss and ultimate wisdom.
###2609 Most westerners are not drawn to Buddhism as a way of leaving society behind
###2612 they're drawn to the practical of meditation as a way of being
###2616 more effective within society and that's a way in which
###2619 the message of Buddhism takes on a very different caste
###2622 because it becomes a form of self improvement a way of dealing
###2627 with the stresses of life a way of clarifying your goals and objectives.
###2634 Many westerners are especially attracted to Buddhist meditation.
###2639 I think all of us sometimes glimpse that magic and mystery of the moment
###2645 what meditation does is to help us touch that more often,
###2649 it helps us to be more calm and controlled in our mind
###2653 and we can create conditions that allow us to come into
###2656 a state of awareness of interdependence, of impermanence, of nirvana.
###2663 Some schools of Buddhism believe the Buddha was superhuman
###2667 a magical figure who consorted with gods and performed miracles.
###2672 Others that he was no more than
###2673 a human being and they believe it is this that adds power to his message.
###2679 There is no doubt that the Buddha wished to be remembered as a human being
###2684 with human frailties not perhaps frailties of the intellect or moral frailties
###2691 but certainly physical frailties
###2693 and the Buddha suffers from back pain towards the end of his life
###2698 he suffers from various physical complaints and weaknesses.
###2703 The Buddha would die at the age of eighty from a common illness - food poisoning.
###2711 It is said that before
###2712 passing away he fell into a deep trance on his journey from this world to Nirvana
###2717 - a state of eternal bliss
###2720 - free at last from rebirth,
###2722 free at last from suffering and death.
###2729 A council was assembled to record for posterity the Buddha's teachings.
###2734 These were learnt by heart and handed down the centuries by generations of monks.
###2741 The Buddha's body was cremated.
###2743 And his remains were preserved.
###2747 They were enshrined two hundred years later
###2750 by India's first Emperor King Ashoka who converted to Buddhism.
###2758 He built vast monuments or stuppas
###2760 and erected pillars to mark the key sites of the Buddha's life.
###2765 Asoka then becomes an absolutely key figure,
###2767 both in terms of the actual spread of Buddhism
###2771 but then as a model
###2773 for future Buddhist leaders throughout Asia they look back to Ashoka as
###2778 the kind of ideal king and supporter of Buddhism.
###2784 So far as we know the Emperor Asoka
###2786 who ruled over two thirds of modern India
###2790 in the middle of the 3rd century BC,
###2793 helped monks to send out missions to countries bordering India,
###2799 missionaries were sent up into Kashmir to Nepal and certainly Sri Lanka.
###2805 They converted the king, the king give his patronize to Buddhism
###2809 and Sri Lanka has therefore been a Buddhist country from that day to this.
###2813 And in country after country we know over many centuries
###2816 that this is the way that Buddhism was successfully implanted.
###2825 Ashoka's pillars outlived Buddhism in India - they withstood Muslim invasions
###2830 and survived to catch the attention of the first colonial archaeologists.
###2835 This gave a very significant impetus to the revival of Buddhism
###2839 - the desire to go back to the places associated with the Buddha.
###2842 Imagining Buddhism for people in the West but these investigations also become
###2847 the basest for a revival within Buddhism in Asia.
###2853 Today the sites associated with the Budha's life attract tourists
###2858 and pilgrims flock to Bodh Gaya to follow in the Buddha's footsteps,
###2862 hoping to find, as he did,
###2864 eternal peace and happiness and a cure for suffering and death.
###2870 It's a great irony that after the Buddha's death the person
###2875 who preached of the uselessness of ritual and also the uselessness
###2879 of personality cult became the object of ritual worship
###2883 and as big a personality cult as has ever existed in history.
###2889 Buddhist temples have been built in Bodh Gaya representing
###2892 the different traditions from around the world.
###2897 Buddhism, in all its forms, has come home, to the Bodi tree,
###2902 to the place where once a prince reached enlightenment and became the Buddha.
###2909 The Buddha attained enlightenment on that fleeting moment of a wink, this moment,
###2919 fleeting moment is the time that takes to realize that moment cannot be explained.
###2931 That special moment gave birth to the first world religion
###2936 - A religion without a God
###2938 where the path to Nirvana lies in the mind of each and every one of us.
