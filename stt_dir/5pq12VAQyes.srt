2
0:3:40,587 --> 0:3:43,423
Judd, you can't.


3
0:3:43,423 --> 0:3:45,391
I got to
get in the house.


4
0:3:45,391 --> 0:3:49,929
Poke your head out in the
clear, and a Falin will get you.


5
0:3:49,929 --> 0:4:13,486
But Melissa,
she's going to have a baby.


6
0:4:13,486 --> 0:4:14,854
Hit you, David?


7
0:4:14,854 --> 0:4:45,18
No Falin can ever
get me, Uncle Judd.


8
0:4:45,18 --> 0:4:50,456
Oh, God, give her the strength to be good,


9
0:4:50,456 --> 0:4:56,195
to be never hateful
and never fight.


10
0:4:56,195 --> 0:4:59,866
And don't let her
carry the burden of fear,


11
0:4:59,866 --> 0:5:5,938
watching her loved ones
and seeing them die.


12
0:5:5,938 --> 0:5:9,242
Always asking
out of her heart,


13
0:5:9,242 --> 0:5:40,973
"Why has it got to be?
Why has it got to be?"


14
0:5:40,973 --> 0:5:47,213
<i>When it's twilight</i>
<i>on the trail</i>


15
0:5:47,213 --> 0:5:50,45
<i>And I jog along</i>


16
0:5:50,45 --> 0:5:53,252
<i>The world is like a dream</i>


17
0:5:53,252 --> 0:5:59,425
<i>And the ripple of the stream</i>
<i>is my song</i>


18
0:5:59,425 --> 0:6:5,164
<i>When it's twilight</i>
<i>on the trail</i>


19
0:6:5,164 --> 0:6:8,568
<i>And I rest once more</i>


20
0:6:8,568 --> 0:6:11,137
<i>My ceiling is the sky</i>


21
0:6:11,137 --> 0:6:17,91
<i>And the grass on which I lie</i>
<i>is my floor</i>


22
0:6:17,91 --> 0:6:23,716
<i>Never ever</i> <i>have a
nickel</i> <i>in my jeans</i>


23
0:6:23,716 --> 0:6:29,188
<i>Never ever</i>
<i>have a debt to pay</i>


24
0:6:29,188 --> 0:6:35,361
<i>Still I understand</i>
<i>what real contentment means</i>


25
0:6:35,361 --> 0:6:41,2
<i>Guess I was born that way</i>


26
0:6:41,2 --> 0:6:47,74
<i>When it's twilight</i>
<i>on the trail</i>


27
0:6:47,74 --> 0:6:51,677
<i>And my voice is still</i>


28
0:6:51,677 --> 0:6:55,181
<i>Please plant</i>
<i>this heart of mine</i>


29
0:6:55,181 --> 0:7:2,321
<i>Underneath</i> <i>the Lonesome
Pine</i> <i>on the hill</i>


30
0:7:2,321 --> 0:7:4,29
And I says to him, I says,
"Look here, Zeke Denker,


31
0:7:4,29 --> 0:7:6,826
"you're driving your hogs
to mighty poor swill."


32
0:7:6,826 --> 0:7:8,594
Bet that buttoned him.
Not Zeke.


33
0:7:8,594 --> 0:7:11,497
He's the laughingest man I
ever met. Nothing bites him.


34
0:7:11,497 --> 0:7:13,266
Laughs when it's clever enough to rain.


35
0:7:13,266 --> 0:7:14,967
Laughs when
the sun shines.


36
0:7:14,967 --> 0:7:18,171
He looks me
right in the eye...


37
0:7:18,171 --> 0:7:19,872
Dave's better.


38
0:7:19,872 --> 0:7:22,308
Is he?
Yep.


39
0:7:22,308 --> 0:7:25,812
Perking up a mite.
Arm's a little green


40
0:7:25,812 --> 0:7:28,14
but I stuck a chaw
of tobaccy on it.


41
0:7:28,14 --> 0:7:30,349
Cold rifle barrel
will do it more good.


42
0:7:30,349 --> 0:7:33,52
What he have to say?
About the Falins I mean.


43
0:7:33,52 --> 0:7:36,722
"Eat your sow belly and get
for home." That's what he said.


44
0:7:36,722 --> 0:7:39,258
Said, "Ain't gonna be no
fighting till I can tote a gun."


45
0:7:39,258 --> 0:7:40,46
And I come six miles.


46
0:7:40,46 --> 0:7:41,627
Six miles.


47
0:7:41,627 --> 0:7:43,996
I can throw a clump
of dogwood that far.


48
0:7:43,996 --> 0:7:48,201
I'm nigh on to 30 miles.
Look. Look.


49
0:7:48,201 --> 0:7:50,303
Gather around now.
Gather around.


50
0:7:50,303 --> 0:7:52,371
I'm really going to
show you something now.


51
0:7:52,371 --> 0:7:55,41
Maybe we's will
get a go at the kid.


52
0:7:55,41 --> 0:7:59,178
Whenever Judd Tolliver gets
an itch to plug the Falins,


53
0:7:59,178 --> 0:8:3,216
he starts playing
with the young ones.


54
0:8:3,216 --> 0:8:5,651
I'm gonna be
the human hub.


55
0:8:5,651 --> 0:8:13,92
Now, Willie, you go down there and
stop me if I get to going too fast.


56
0:8:13,92 --> 0:8:18,3
Lizzie Bee, you better
go down and help Willie.


57
0:8:18,3 --> 0:8:31,21
Look out now, here I come.
Don't forget to stop me.


58
0:8:31,21 --> 0:8:41,988
Well, why didn't
you stop me?


59
0:8:41,988 --> 0:8:52,532
Judd's better than that
wagon show we saw once.


60
0:8:52,532 --> 0:8:57,103
Melissa, you got a bellyache or something?


61
0:8:57,103 --> 0:8:58,938
Just thinking, Lina.


62
0:8:58,938 --> 0:9:0,706
Sakes and sassafras!


63
0:9:0,706 --> 0:9:2,575
Thinking
boils the pot over.


64
0:9:2,575 --> 0:9:7,613
It boils over and over and
over if you ain't thinking.


65
0:9:7,613 --> 0:9:11,35
Killing.
All the time killing.


66
0:9:11,35 --> 0:9:13,986
They are planning it now.
They done it yesterday,


67
0:9:13,986 --> 0:9:16,522
and the week before,
and the year before that.


68
0:9:16,522 --> 0:9:19,525
Ever since I was a little child they done it.


69
0:9:19,525 --> 0:9:21,494
Kill a Falin.
Kill a Falin.


70
0:9:21,494 --> 0:9:23,229
That's all they could say.


71
0:9:23,229 --> 0:9:26,332
Plowing, splitting reins.
Filling the corn crib.


72
0:9:26,332 --> 0:9:30,736
Kill a Falin! And the echo comes
back to us from over the hills.


73
0:9:30,736 --> 0:9:35,241
Kill a Tolliver.
Kill. Kill. Why?


74
0:9:35,241 --> 0:9:42,548
Melissa!


75
0:9:42,548 --> 0:9:45,117
What you biting
your paws about, Auntie?


76
0:9:45,117 --> 0:9:47,954
Worrying, I guess, June
and Buddie ain't back yet.


77
0:9:47,954 --> 0:9:49,455
Where they be?


78
0:9:49,455 --> 0:9:57,597
Over at the yard doctor,
getting a potion for you.


79
0:9:57,597 --> 0:10:3,235
Is that the way
you like it?


80
0:10:3,235 --> 0:10:4,303
Just right.


81
0:10:4,303 --> 0:10:7,239
You should have let me
get a town doctor, Dave.


82
0:10:7,239 --> 0:10:10,543
It don't look right.
It's too swole up.


83
0:10:10,543 --> 0:10:11,911
You're awfully
good to me, Auntie.


84
0:10:11,911 --> 0:10:13,546
You're a good boy, Dave.


85
0:10:13,546 --> 0:10:15,14
Your boy.


86
0:10:15,14 --> 0:10:16,449
My boy.


87
0:10:16,449 --> 0:10:18,618
Sometimes I wished I was,
Auntie. Then I wished I wasn't


88
0:10:18,618 --> 0:10:23,122
'cause if I was, I couldn't
marry June and if I wasn't...


89
0:10:23,122 --> 0:10:25,791
Relations like we ones
got me all thicked up.


90
0:10:25,791 --> 0:10:30,463
Cousins are always thicker than
fleas in the mountains, Dave.


91
0:10:30,463 --> 0:10:35,34
I'm a big, big
black bear.


92
0:10:35,34 --> 0:10:42,808
I'm a mean black bear.


93
0:10:42,808 --> 0:10:54,2
I'm getting closer.
I'll get you.


94
0:10:54,2 --> 0:11:10,903
I'm coming closer.


95
0:11:10,903 --> 0:11:14,206
You laugh at me, foreigner,
and I'll... I'll...


96
0:11:14,206 --> 0:11:27,787
I don't blame you, I'd
do the same thing myself.


97
0:11:27,787 --> 0:11:30,356
That was funny.
Why didn't you laugh?


98
0:11:30,356 --> 0:11:31,657
She's one of
the Tollivers.


99
0:11:31,657 --> 0:11:32,892
That's still funny.


100
0:11:32,892 --> 0:11:34,26
She didn't think so.


101
0:11:34,26 --> 0:11:35,795
That's a woman's privilege.


102
0:11:35,795 --> 0:11:36,996
Now, where were we?


103
0:11:36,996 --> 0:11:38,397
Right in the middle of
that fault, over there.


104
0:11:38,397 --> 0:11:39,565
Yeah.


105
0:11:39,565 --> 0:11:42,635
Two years supply of strip-coal
before we have to drift mine it.


106
0:11:42,635 --> 0:11:43,869
We'll steam-shovel
the top coal


107
0:11:43,869 --> 0:11:46,172
and make it pay for
the railroad up here.


108
0:11:46,172 --> 0:11:47,54
You haven't got it yet.


109
0:11:47,54 --> 0:11:48,674
No.


110
0:11:48,674 --> 0:11:50,209
Well, suppose you let me worry about that.


111
0:11:50,209 --> 0:11:54,58
The right and title to that
privilege is yours, my friend.


112
0:11:54,58 --> 0:11:56,882
You got that privilege
this very minute.


113
0:11:56,882 --> 0:12:3,189
Start using it.


114
0:12:3,189 --> 0:12:4,724
I was just
running in that wood,


115
0:12:4,724 --> 0:12:6,559
and I heard
she was a bear.


116
0:12:6,559 --> 0:12:8,694
And when I looked
around to see if she


117
0:12:8,694 --> 0:12:10,296
was going to eat me,
she was gone.


118
0:12:10,296 --> 0:12:12,732
Maybe she ate herself
and disappeared.


119
0:12:12,732 --> 0:12:15,434
Judd Tolliver,
how you talk.


120
0:12:15,434 --> 0:12:18,404
Child. Child. You mustn't.


121
0:12:18,404 --> 0:12:20,172
Juny's coming back.


122
0:12:20,172 --> 0:12:31,417
Maybe she stopped
down by the river.


123
0:12:31,417 --> 0:12:33,753
Looks like she fetched
the river with her.


124
0:12:33,753 --> 0:12:35,54
June!


125
0:12:35,54 --> 0:12:36,489
Well, I brung it,
didn't I?


126
0:12:36,489 --> 0:12:38,424
June, if you ain't
the lookingest...


127
0:12:38,424 --> 0:12:39,759
I've been running
across that log


128
0:12:39,759 --> 0:12:41,961
ever since I was knee high to a grasshopper.


129
0:12:41,961 --> 0:12:44,29
I can catch a squirrel
on it with one hand,


130
0:12:44,29 --> 0:12:45,564
but when that dog
see that foreigner...


131
0:12:45,564 --> 0:12:47,199
Foreigner?


132
0:12:47,199 --> 0:12:50,136
He stopped right smack-dab in the
middle of the log and I tripped.


133
0:12:50,136 --> 0:12:51,637
What was
the foreigner doing?


134
0:12:51,637 --> 0:12:53,839
Don't know.
Wasn't looking.


135
0:12:53,839 --> 0:12:56,342
Before you know it, there
I go. Plunk, right down.


136
0:12:56,342 --> 0:12:57,643
What did he look like?


137
0:12:57,643 --> 0:12:58,911
Just had a squint.


138
0:12:58,911 --> 0:13:3,482
He's about so tall,
about that wide.


139
0:13:3,482 --> 0:13:5,851
Was all dressed in brown,
even his hat.


140
0:13:5,851 --> 0:13:7,353
And his coat had a belt.


141
0:13:7,353 --> 0:13:9,121
Just a squint?


142
0:13:9,121 --> 0:13:10,589
Dave Tolliver,
if you're thinking


143
0:13:10,589 --> 0:13:12,24
what I'm a thinking, I'm
going to tell you off.


144
0:13:12,24 --> 0:13:14,794
Go down to the creek
and wash your dirty face.


145
0:13:14,794 --> 0:13:16,929
For two carrot seeds,
I'd rub it all over you.


146
0:13:16,929 --> 0:13:19,231
You do it, and I'll spank you where it hurts.


147
0:13:19,231 --> 0:13:24,436
You will, will you?


148
0:13:24,436 --> 0:13:27,606
Did that hurt?


149
0:13:27,606 --> 0:13:29,408
How could it?


150
0:13:29,408 --> 0:13:33,279
Oh!


151
0:13:33,279 --> 0:13:35,915
I've been talking
to your pappy.


152
0:13:35,915 --> 0:13:39,819
We's going to get married.


153
0:13:39,819 --> 0:13:41,53
When?
Hog killing time.


154
0:13:41,53 --> 0:13:42,521
Your pappy has invited all the Tollivers.


155
0:13:42,521 --> 0:13:44,857
The whole kit
and boodle of them.


156
0:13:44,857 --> 0:13:46,692
I ain't marrying
till green up.


157
0:13:46,692 --> 0:13:48,527
Spring's always
the time to do them things.


158
0:13:48,527 --> 0:13:52,832
Then it'll be next green up and the next.


159
0:13:52,832 --> 0:13:55,301
I don't feel nothing.


160
0:13:55,301 --> 0:13:59,171
Like... What do you mean?


161
0:13:59,171 --> 0:14:4,51
I don't know.


162
0:14:4,51 --> 0:14:7,78
Come on. Come on.


163
0:14:7,78 --> 0:14:9,215
Dinner.


164
0:14:9,215 --> 0:14:12,218
Come on.


165
0:14:12,218 --> 0:14:13,953
Better make it just a dipping, June, or them


166
0:14:13,953 --> 0:14:16,322
hungry mouths
will eat that table bare.


167
0:14:16,322 --> 0:14:22,194
Ma. Come here.


168
0:14:22,194 --> 0:14:26,599
Ma. Do I...


169
0:14:26,599 --> 0:14:28,767
Do I like Dave?


170
0:14:28,767 --> 0:14:32,771
Why, honey,
I think you do.


171
0:14:32,771 --> 0:14:37,676
Like you like Pappy?


172
0:14:37,676 --> 0:14:44,283
Well, you remember when
Dave went to Pokey Wells,


173
0:14:44,283 --> 0:14:47,152
you was a-grieving for him
then, weren't you?


174
0:14:47,152 --> 0:14:51,29
And when he's to home, he
don't make no nevermind to you?


175
0:14:51,29 --> 0:14:53,92
But, Ma...
Melissa,


176
0:14:53,92 --> 0:14:54,927
the folks are waiting for their dinner.


177
0:14:54,927 --> 0:14:56,862
Coming.


178
0:14:56,862 --> 0:16:17,843
Well, that's
liking, honey.


179
0:16:17,843 --> 0:16:20,79
This here man wants
to talk to you, Judd.


180
0:16:20,79 --> 0:16:21,413
Does, huh?


181
0:16:21,413 --> 0:16:25,651
My name is Hale,
Jack Hale.


182
0:16:25,651 --> 0:16:27,853
I wonder if I could
see you alone.


183
0:16:27,853 --> 0:16:29,121
Here's all right.


184
0:16:29,121 --> 0:16:32,24
Well, I...


185
0:16:32,24 --> 0:16:38,97
You see, I wanted to
talk to you about coal.


186
0:16:38,97 --> 0:16:40,899
The coal on your property,
I mean.


187
0:16:40,899 --> 0:16:43,2
You know what I mean? The
fault down about a mile.


188
0:16:43,2 --> 0:16:45,904
Well, you've seen the coal.
You know what I mean.


189
0:16:45,904 --> 0:16:51,377
The fault. The Alton people,
I'm with them and they...


190
0:16:51,377 --> 0:16:53,45
You was talking
about coal.


191
0:16:53,45 --> 0:16:54,279
Oh, yes. Coal.


192
0:16:54,279 --> 0:16:55,848
There'll be a railroad
up along the Ticopi


193
0:16:55,848 --> 0:16:57,549
and then down across the ridge to your place.


194
0:16:57,549 --> 0:16:58,784
Who said there would?


195
0:16:58,784 --> 0:17:0,452
I mean, of course,
if it's agreeable with


196
0:17:0,452 --> 0:17:2,755
the contracting parties,
like yourself.


197
0:17:2,755 --> 0:17:4,857
The thing will make you rich.
There's no doubt about that.


198
0:17:4,857 --> 0:17:6,25
And if we can
make a deal...


199
0:17:6,25 --> 0:17:8,66
Who's the others?


200
0:17:8,66 --> 0:17:10,796
The contract with you
is for the coal.


201
0:17:10,796 --> 0:17:12,97
Who is the others?


202
0:17:12,97 --> 0:17:22,307
Well, there's several
other people, but mainly...


203
0:17:22,307 --> 0:17:23,375
How long have you had that?


204
0:17:23,375 --> 0:17:24,877
You ain't
answered me yet.


205
0:17:24,877 --> 0:17:26,745
When did this arm begin to show that color?


206
0:17:26,745 --> 0:17:30,582
Three days ago now,
I think.


207
0:17:30,582 --> 0:17:33,318
Get me some
warm water, quick.


208
0:17:33,318 --> 0:17:34,887
It ain't bad, is it?


209
0:17:34,887 --> 0:17:37,389
Bad?
It's gangrenous infection.


210
0:17:37,389 --> 0:17:39,24
The flesh,
it's rotting, it's dying.


211
0:17:39,24 --> 0:17:40,325
You ain't no doctor.


212
0:17:40,325 --> 0:17:42,461
You wanna live,
don't you?


213
0:17:42,461 --> 0:17:44,43
Why didn't you get this man to a doctor? Did.


214
0:17:44,43 --> 0:17:46,265
There it be. Snake brew.
You fool.


215
0:17:46,265 --> 0:17:49,701
He'll die if something isn't done.


216
0:17:49,701 --> 0:17:52,104
Am I dying, Judd?


217
0:17:52,104 --> 0:17:53,906
Sure.


218
0:17:53,906 --> 0:17:56,508
Better start making
the pine box, I guess.


219
0:17:56,508 --> 0:18:2,514
That's just what you will be
doing if something isn't done.


220
0:18:2,514 --> 0:18:3,882
Now listen to me.


221
0:18:3,882 --> 0:18:5,918
Once an infection like
this sets in, it kills.


222
0:18:5,918 --> 0:18:8,921
The only possible cure is
to cut it out, and then pray.


223
0:18:8,921 --> 0:18:10,756
Now do you understand?


224
0:18:10,756 --> 0:18:13,358
No. No.
They don't understand.


225
0:18:13,358 --> 0:18:16,395
They don't understand nothing
but shooting and killing.


226
0:18:16,395 --> 0:18:18,297
That's all they understand.
Melissa.


227
0:18:18,297 --> 0:18:21,633
I been begging you to get a
doctor, but no, you got to plan.


228
0:18:21,633 --> 0:18:26,505
You got to scheme, you got to
figure out how to kill. All of you.


229
0:18:26,505 --> 0:18:29,942
Your crops could rot
and your cattle starve.


230
0:18:29,942 --> 0:18:32,778
And you wouldn't care as long as
you was back of a squirrel rifle,


231
0:18:32,778 --> 0:18:36,482
and here was a Falin
at the other end of it.


232
0:18:36,482 --> 0:18:40,586
Now it's getting back at you. He's dying.


233
0:18:40,586 --> 0:18:45,357
You heard him say it.
My Davie's dying.


234
0:18:45,357 --> 0:18:54,933
Melissa.


235
0:18:54,933 --> 0:18:57,269
Here.


236
0:18:57,269 --> 0:18:58,37
I'm sorry,
I didn't know...


237
0:18:58,37 --> 0:19:2,441
Here.


238
0:19:2,441 --> 0:19:3,976
Get me a cloth,
a tourniquet.


239
0:19:3,976 --> 0:19:9,448
Something to tighten around his
arm and shut off the circulation.


240
0:19:9,448 --> 0:19:13,118
Get me some small knives,
the sharpest you've got.


241
0:19:13,118 --> 0:19:18,423
Get that fire going. Heat the
knives till they're white-hot.


242
0:19:18,423 --> 0:19:42,681
Keep that down and help me steady his arm.


243
0:19:42,681 --> 0:19:44,516
This is going to hurt.
We have no anesthetic.


244
0:19:44,516 --> 0:19:49,421
Something to put you to sleep, I mean.


245
0:19:49,421 --> 0:19:52,691
Better stouting up the corn
liquor with a little pepper.


246
0:19:52,691 --> 0:20:4,469
Looks like
I'm gonna need it.


247
0:20:4,469 --> 0:20:9,208
<i>Ain't got no money,</i>
<i>nowhere to spend it</i>


248
0:20:9,208 --> 0:20:13,812
<i>Ain't got no wife,</i>
<i>too independent</i>


249
0:20:13,812 --> 0:20:19,284
<i>Ain't got no mule</i>
<i>to ride around</i>


250
0:20:19,284 --> 0:20:24,656
<i>It's just because</i> <i>I'm
the poorest man</i> <i>in town</i>


251
0:20:24,656 --> 0:20:29,94
<i>Poor me</i>
<i>Poor me</i>


252
0:20:29,94 --> 0:20:33,665
<i>I wonder</i> <i>when I'm
gonna</i> <i>end this misery</i>


253
0:20:33,665 --> 0:20:35,667
I made up that
last line myself.


254
0:20:35,667 --> 0:20:37,869
Yeah? That's what
it sounded like.


255
0:20:37,869 --> 0:20:40,472
Thinking maybe you might have
a job for me, so I moseyed up.


256
0:20:40,472 --> 0:20:43,609
Well, mosey down,
and the quicker the better.


257
0:20:43,609 --> 0:20:44,977
What you got your back up for, mister?


258
0:20:44,977 --> 0:20:48,814
Go on, get on.


259
0:20:48,814 --> 0:20:51,316
They're talking
down in town as to how


260
0:20:51,316 --> 0:20:53,85
your boss saved
Dave Tolliver's life.


261
0:20:53,85 --> 0:20:55,52
That so?
Yes, the idiot.


262
0:20:55,52 --> 0:20:57,89
Two minutes
after he'd met him,


263
0:20:57,89 --> 0:20:59,558
he's carving his initials
in the fellow's arm.


264
0:20:59,558 --> 0:21:1,96
And does it get him anything? It does not.


265
0:21:1,96 --> 0:21:3,428
The whole thing's a washout.


266
0:21:3,428 --> 0:21:5,631
No coal, no railroad.


267
0:21:5,631 --> 0:21:13,5
And as for this Judd Tolliver, he's
just an ungrateful chunk of dry rot.


268
0:21:13,5 --> 0:21:14,64
They didn't ask him,
did they?


269
0:21:14,64 --> 0:21:16,942
Ask him what?


270
0:21:16,942 --> 0:21:18,51
To save Dave's life.


271
0:21:18,51 --> 0:21:21,947
Of course they didn't,
you walking phonograph.


272
0:21:21,947 --> 0:21:25,83
But what's that
got to do with it?


273
0:21:25,83 --> 0:21:28,887
We ones
is funny people.


274
0:21:28,887 --> 0:21:35,861
Mmm. Elderberries.


275
0:21:35,861 --> 0:21:48,64
Elderberries?


276
0:21:48,64 --> 0:21:50,475
Okay, partner, here's
where I get off the train.


277
0:21:50,475 --> 0:21:52,177
Ain't I gonna
see you no more?


278
0:21:52,177 --> 0:21:54,846
Well, I don't know.


279
0:21:54,846 --> 0:21:56,682
Not unless your dad
changes his mind.


280
0:21:56,682 --> 0:21:58,583
Now, don't you think
you'd better run along home?


281
0:21:58,583 --> 0:22:1,52
First, could I put my arms around you?


282
0:22:1,52 --> 0:22:4,289
Can you?
I'll say you can.


283
0:22:4,289 --> 0:22:6,525
Say, you won't forget
your lesson, will you?


284
0:22:6,525 --> 0:22:7,693
Uh-uh.


285
0:22:7,693 --> 0:22:9,728
Book learning
is good for people


286
0:22:9,728 --> 0:22:12,64
because it makes them build
what's inside of them.


287
0:22:12,64 --> 0:22:13,665
Swell.


288
0:22:13,665 --> 0:22:17,169
Some day I'm gonna build a
automobile, I'm gonna build a plane...


289
0:22:17,169 --> 0:22:18,637
Whoa! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.


290
0:22:18,637 --> 0:22:20,205
And all those things
you told me about.


291
0:22:20,205 --> 0:22:21,306
Well, if you're
gonna do all that,


292
0:22:21,306 --> 0:22:24,76
you'd better go home
and start studying.


293
0:22:24,76 --> 0:22:25,577
Bye.
Goodbye.


294
0:22:25,577 --> 0:22:31,95
Come on, Tuffy,
grab the coal car.


295
0:22:31,95 --> 0:22:45,364
There you go.


296
0:22:45,364 --> 0:22:48,533
Well?


297
0:22:48,533 --> 0:22:49,801
Pappy wants to see you.


298
0:22:49,801 --> 0:22:52,237
He saw me,
I'm sorry to say.


299
0:22:52,237 --> 0:22:55,34
He changed his mind.


300
0:22:55,34 --> 0:22:57,42
You mean
he'll sign the agreement?


301
0:22:57,42 --> 0:23:4,483
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.


302
0:23:4,483 --> 0:23:6,351
Wait a minute.
This isn't a gag, is it?


303
0:23:6,351 --> 0:23:7,486
A what?


304
0:23:7,486 --> 0:23:9,721
Skip it.
I'll take a chance.


305
0:23:9,721 --> 0:23:20,499
This way. It's shorter.


306
0:23:20,499 --> 0:23:23,668
<i>Love is everywhere</i>


307
0:23:23,668 --> 0:23:29,608
<i>Its music fills the air</i>


308
0:23:29,608 --> 0:23:31,343
You gonna
talk to me now?


309
0:23:31,343 --> 0:23:34,212
Not a chance. Not even if your
father signed 40 contracts.


310
0:23:34,212 --> 0:23:35,614
I'm just as stubborn
as you are, young lady.


311
0:23:35,614 --> 0:23:37,649
And not word you get out of
me until you've apologized.


312
0:23:37,649 --> 0:23:38,817
I didn't do nothing.


313
0:23:38,817 --> 0:23:40,852
You didn't do nothing?
What do you call nothing?


314
0:23:40,852 --> 0:23:43,422
You were going to spit in my
eyes. You stomped on my foot.


315
0:23:43,422 --> 0:23:45,757
And when I tried to teach Buddie
his ABCs, you laughed at me.


316
0:23:45,757 --> 0:23:52,364
And you call that
nothing?


317
0:23:52,364 --> 0:23:54,65
Oh, my!
What a nice pretty.


318
0:23:54,65 --> 0:23:55,233
Where'd you get it?


319
0:23:55,233 --> 0:23:56,468
It's just a...
Can I have it?


320
0:23:56,468 --> 0:23:57,536
Why...


321
0:23:57,536 --> 0:24:1,573
I can?
Well, ain't that sweet?


322
0:24:1,573 --> 0:24:3,241
What do you say
to apologize?


323
0:24:3,241 --> 0:24:6,578
Just say, "Mr. Hale, I regret
exceedingly my unfortunate error."


324
0:24:6,578 --> 0:24:7,712
Them's hard words.


325
0:24:7,712 --> 0:24:15,554
All right.
Say it your own way.


326
0:24:15,554 --> 0:24:17,55
I regret.


327
0:24:17,55 --> 0:24:19,9
You regret what?


328
0:24:19,9 --> 0:24:23,361
I'm apologizing.


329
0:24:23,361 --> 0:24:24,729
All right. What do
you wanna talk about?


330
0:24:24,729 --> 0:24:26,465
Don't make no difference.


331
0:24:26,465 --> 0:24:27,899
All right.
Let's talk about you.


332
0:24:27,899 --> 0:24:30,135
I'd like that.


333
0:24:30,135 --> 0:24:33,371
Well, some day very soon now,
your father will have money,


334
0:24:33,371 --> 0:24:35,173
and you'll be
married to Dave.


335
0:24:35,173 --> 0:24:37,342
And what a lucky girl
you are.


336
0:24:37,342 --> 0:24:38,977
And all this
around here will be...


337
0:24:38,977 --> 0:24:40,579
Well, maybe over there
will be a big house


338
0:24:40,579 --> 0:24:46,351
and with a lawn
way down to here, and...


339
0:24:46,351 --> 0:24:48,253
Did you ever see
a grasshopper real close?


340
0:24:48,253 --> 0:24:50,455
Have him spit in my eye?
Not me.


341
0:24:50,455 --> 0:24:52,891
You see that little yellow spot on its leg?


342
0:24:52,891 --> 0:24:54,659
Well, if you touch it,
you know what will happen?


343
0:24:54,659 --> 0:24:55,961
No. I give up. What?


344
0:24:55,961 --> 0:24:57,529
Its leg will pop off.


345
0:24:57,529 --> 0:25:0,765
You little savage.


346
0:25:0,765 --> 0:25:2,67
Am I?


347
0:25:2,67 --> 0:25:4,503
Yes, you are. And when I
see Dave, I'm gonna tell him.


348
0:25:4,503 --> 0:25:6,605
Let's walk. It's a mite near a mile here.


349
0:25:6,605 --> 0:25:7,706
A mile?


350
0:25:7,706 --> 0:25:9,875
I thought you said
this was a shortcut.


351
0:25:9,875 --> 0:25:19,15
Did I?


352
0:25:19,15 --> 0:25:20,619
"Its successors
and assigns forever,


353
0:25:20,619 --> 0:25:23,388
"all mines, veins,
seams and beds of coal


354
0:25:23,388 --> 0:25:25,59
"and all other minerals
whatsoever already found


355
0:25:25,59 --> 0:25:27,692
"or which may
hereafter be found


356
0:25:27,692 --> 0:25:31,263
"upon or under all that certain
tract, piece or parcel of land


357
0:25:31,263 --> 0:25:32,998
"situate, lying
and being in the..."


358
0:25:32,998 --> 0:25:34,666
Slow down, man.


359
0:25:34,666 --> 0:25:38,3
Them squirrel tracks and chicken
scratches don't mean nothing to me.


360
0:25:38,3 --> 0:25:39,671
You trying to tell me
and Judd your coal


361
0:25:39,671 --> 0:25:41,306
won't be disruptious
to our corn?


362
0:25:41,306 --> 0:25:42,641
Is that what
you're trying to tell us?


363
0:25:42,641 --> 0:25:44,175
That's right.


364
0:25:44,175 --> 0:25:45,977
And we get quite
a toting of money?


365
0:25:45,977 --> 0:25:49,47
$5,000 in 30 days and a percentage
of the company's earnings.


366
0:25:49,47 --> 0:25:50,482
What's that percentage?


367
0:25:50,482 --> 0:25:53,618
It's like pigs, Pappy. You get one
out of six for taking care of them.


368
0:25:53,618 --> 0:25:55,754
Oh! Figures sensible.


369
0:25:55,754 --> 0:26:0,325
Mr. Hale, is this the kind of
steam shovel you told me about?


370
0:26:0,325 --> 0:26:1,726
Yes, but you look
in the back, Buddie,


371
0:26:1,726 --> 0:26:3,528
and you'll find
a great big one.


372
0:26:3,528 --> 0:26:5,13
I'll give...
Dave says it's sensible.


373
0:26:5,13 --> 0:26:6,698
I guess it's sensible.


374
0:26:6,698 --> 0:26:8,633
But there's
one thing eating me.


375
0:26:8,633 --> 0:26:9,801
What's that,
Mr. Tolliver?


376
0:26:9,801 --> 0:26:11,369
Is there no other way
for you to build


377
0:26:11,369 --> 0:26:13,471
your railroad
up to our place,


378
0:26:13,471 --> 0:26:15,6
except across the Falins?


379
0:26:15,6 --> 0:26:17,242
But it won't be the Falins. The
company will own the property.


380
0:26:17,242 --> 0:26:19,11
Yeah, but it were
the Falins.


381
0:26:19,11 --> 0:26:21,646
They walked on it. They
drove the sheep across it.


382
0:26:21,646 --> 0:26:23,381
The spring water
down by the Knuckle,


383
0:26:23,381 --> 0:26:25,383
they put their
poisonous faces in it.


384
0:26:25,383 --> 0:26:27,319
It's got the
Falins' smell on it.


385
0:26:27,319 --> 0:26:30,255
And me ones will make money going on it? No.


386
0:26:30,255 --> 0:26:32,9
No. There ain't
gonna be a Tolliver...


387
0:26:32,9 --> 0:26:35,627
It ain't gonna stop you from
shooting the dirty swine, is it?


388
0:26:35,627 --> 0:26:38,897
The land was here long afore
they come. It's tetched with God.


389
0:26:38,897 --> 0:26:40,298
And he ain't going to
taint it just 'cause


390
0:26:40,298 --> 0:26:42,901
a lot of snakes is
a- crawling in the fallows.


391
0:26:42,901 --> 0:26:45,87
We been poor-hogging long enough.
I got a chance for fancies,


392
0:26:45,87 --> 0:26:47,5
and I'm gonna have them.


393
0:26:47,5 --> 0:26:48,206
That ain't no talk
to your pappy.


394
0:26:48,206 --> 0:26:49,274
I'm talking
to you, too!


395
0:26:49,274 --> 0:26:50,342
I ought to
spank your hide.


396
0:26:50,342 --> 0:26:52,11
You don't need no fotch-on
clothes to be happy.


397
0:26:52,11 --> 0:26:54,913
Just a minute, Dave. I didn't
want to start an argument.


398
0:26:54,913 --> 0:26:56,381
Mr. Tolliver, I don't doubt that you have


399
0:26:56,381 --> 0:26:57,816
every reason
to hate the Falins.


400
0:26:57,816 --> 0:26:59,84
They must have done
you a great wrong...


401
0:26:59,84 --> 0:27:0,952
We don't want no preacher talk from you.


402
0:27:0,952 --> 0:27:3,622
The Tollivers don't like
the Falins and they know why.


403
0:27:3,622 --> 0:27:6,57
And we don't want to be
learned off by no outsiders.


404
0:27:6,57 --> 0:27:7,325
But, Dave,
I'm not trying to...


405
0:27:7,325 --> 0:27:8,526
You saved my life.


406
0:27:8,526 --> 0:27:11,62
You was leaving without a
squeal when we turned you down.


407
0:27:11,62 --> 0:27:13,198
You couldn't have done that
without you was meaning right.


408
0:27:13,198 --> 0:27:20,739
Just don't argue,
that's all.


409
0:27:20,739 --> 0:27:25,377
Where do we sign?


410
0:27:25,377 --> 0:27:46,564
Right here.


411
0:27:46,564 --> 0:27:48,466
The company's
offering you $5,000.


412
0:27:48,466 --> 0:27:50,802
That's a lot of money,
Mr. Falin.


413
0:27:50,802 --> 0:27:52,437
Both sides of our right
of way will still be yours.


414
0:27:52,437 --> 0:27:54,506
It won't interfere
with your farming.


415
0:27:54,506 --> 0:27:55,94
Mr. Thurber here can vouch for our company.


416
0:27:55,94 --> 0:27:57,108
He's kept its books
for years.


417
0:27:57,108 --> 0:27:58,877
Yes. That's right.
Indeed it is.


418
0:27:58,877 --> 0:28:1,312
We don't want no tail-ender
drippings of a Tolliver.


419
0:28:1,312 --> 0:28:2,914
Wade's right. You can't make
butter out of goose grease.


420
0:28:2,914 --> 0:28:5,617
Shut up!


421
0:28:5,617 --> 0:28:7,318
What did
Judd Tolliver say?


422
0:28:7,318 --> 0:28:12,957
Well, he said that...


423
0:28:12,957 --> 0:28:18,29
He said he'd rot before he had
anything to do with a Falin.


424
0:28:18,29 --> 0:28:25,503
That sounds like Judd.


425
0:28:25,503 --> 0:28:28,306
Where do I scratch?


426
0:28:28,306 --> 0:30:3,334
Right here
on the bottom line.


427
0:30:3,334 --> 0:30:5,69
Jack, give us a hand.


428
0:30:5,69 --> 0:30:6,738
You know something
about carpentry.


429
0:30:6,738 --> 0:30:8,206
What's the matter with it?
You're doing all right.


430
0:30:8,206 --> 0:30:9,774
Yeah, I'm not running
any kindergarten.


431
0:30:9,774 --> 0:30:11,276
I got very little use
for children.


432
0:30:11,276 --> 0:30:12,577
In fact
I hate the brats.


433
0:30:12,577 --> 0:30:13,845
Look at me.
Look what I'm doing.


434
0:30:13,845 --> 0:30:16,147
If any of
my friends saw me...


435
0:30:16,147 --> 0:30:17,415
Say, did you send that
check to Judd Tolliver?


436
0:30:17,415 --> 0:30:20,251
Yeah, this morning. Listen.
Would you put a nail in here?


437
0:30:20,251 --> 0:30:45,643
Or... Don't let me
keep you.


438
0:30:45,643 --> 0:30:47,912
Going 'coon hunting, Dave?


439
0:30:47,912 --> 0:30:52,55
Skunk.


440
0:30:52,55 --> 0:30:54,853
Mighty nigh well,
ain't it?


441
0:30:54,853 --> 0:30:56,521
That's why
I'm going hunting.


442
0:30:56,521 --> 0:30:58,456
I don't want you to
fight, Dave.


443
0:30:58,456 --> 0:31:0,124
Leave the Falins be.


444
0:31:0,124 --> 0:31:2,16
There's turning over
to be done.


445
0:31:2,16 --> 0:31:5,63
And I'll be wanting corn
husks for my mattresses.


446
0:31:5,63 --> 0:31:9,1
And we got scrapple to make
and all kinds of things.


447
0:31:9,1 --> 0:31:12,37
You're the only
big boy I've got, Dave.


448
0:31:12,37 --> 0:31:13,671
Families round
about got lots.


449
0:31:13,671 --> 0:31:15,506
Maybe they wouldn't
miss them none.


450
0:31:15,506 --> 0:31:17,842
Maybe they wouldn't.


451
0:31:17,842 --> 0:31:25,283
You're always snorting preachments,
Auntie. You make me sick.


452
0:31:25,283 --> 0:31:28,119
Two pink-eyed doves
sitting in a tree.


453
0:31:28,119 --> 0:31:33,858
One for you
and one for me.


454
0:31:33,858 --> 0:31:35,93
Dave.


455
0:31:35,93 --> 0:31:36,794
My eggs.


456
0:31:36,794 --> 0:31:42,867
Ma! Pa! Dave!
We just got a letter.


457
0:31:42,867 --> 0:31:45,57
We just got a letter.


458
0:31:45,57 --> 0:31:47,438
Pa. A letter.


459
0:31:47,438 --> 0:31:49,14
Juny.


460
0:31:49,14 --> 0:31:50,642
We just got a letter.


461
0:31:50,642 --> 0:31:54,379
A man gave to me
up the road.


462
0:31:54,379 --> 0:31:55,947
Ma, look!


463
0:31:55,947 --> 0:31:58,449
You act like
we never got one before.


464
0:31:58,449 --> 0:32:0,752
We got one when Dave come to live with us


465
0:32:0,752 --> 0:32:4,355
and then we got
another one when...


466
0:32:4,355 --> 0:32:5,523
Who's it for?


467
0:32:5,523 --> 0:32:7,458
Whoever it's writ
to on the front.


468
0:32:7,458 --> 0:32:10,161
Sure enough.


469
0:32:10,161 --> 0:32:11,93
Well, might as well
open it.


470
0:32:11,93 --> 0:32:14,666
What for? We ain't going to be no better off.


471
0:32:14,666 --> 0:32:16,367
Well, you ain't
much help.


472
0:32:16,367 --> 0:32:37,822
Open her up
anyway, Judd.


473
0:32:37,822 --> 0:32:39,824
It's from
the coal company. See?


474
0:32:39,824 --> 0:32:42,76
There's a picture
of a mine on it.


475
0:32:42,76 --> 0:32:45,53
$5,000.


476
0:32:45,53 --> 0:32:49,834
It's just
a piece of paper.


477
0:32:49,834 --> 0:32:51,102
This here's a check.


478
0:32:51,102 --> 0:32:53,104
I seen one once
in Gaptown.


479
0:32:53,104 --> 0:32:55,406
Folks, we're richer
than cream cheese.


480
0:32:55,406 --> 0:32:58,42
And I can get the things
I want, can't I, Pappy?


481
0:32:58,42 --> 0:33:0,611
Now, now, now.
Not so jumpy.


482
0:33:0,611 --> 0:33:2,46
There's one thing
we got to get


483
0:33:2,46 --> 0:33:4,82
more important
than that first,


484
0:33:4,82 --> 0:33:8,653
and that's
a new dress for Melissa.


485
0:33:8,653 --> 0:33:9,988
Oh! Judd.


486
0:33:9,988 --> 0:33:12,9
You sure got it
coming to you, Mammy.


487
0:33:12,9 --> 0:33:13,992
With pearl buttons it'll
have. Won't it, Pappy?


488
0:33:13,992 --> 0:33:16,26
Yeah, pearl buttons.
And the next thing


489
0:33:16,26 --> 0:33:21,532
we got to get is hat
and shoes for Mammy.


490
0:33:21,532 --> 0:33:26,471
It just...
You're making me cry.


491
0:33:26,471 --> 0:33:28,906
Judd Tolliver, you said
you weren't talking to me.


492
0:33:28,906 --> 0:33:32,643
That was when
I was poor. $5,000.


493
0:33:32,643 --> 0:33:34,545
Wait a minute. I got
some choosing to do, too.


494
0:33:34,545 --> 0:33:35,947
Part of that's mine.


495
0:33:35,947 --> 0:33:37,949
Sure. Half.


496
0:33:37,949 --> 0:33:39,617
Half? I get way less than half.


497
0:33:39,617 --> 0:33:44,756
My land's just
a little hog bag.


498
0:33:44,756 --> 0:33:47,392
Which way says
you win or lose?


499
0:33:47,392 --> 0:33:51,529
North.


500
0:33:51,529 --> 0:34:3,307
South. You lose, so you get half.


501
0:34:3,307 --> 0:34:6,778
You know the first thing
I'm gonna buy?


502
0:34:6,778 --> 0:34:8,112
Dave Tolliver,
get some pepper in you.


503
0:34:8,112 --> 0:34:9,38
What?


504
0:34:9,38 --> 0:34:10,581
For more than
a month now,


505
0:34:10,581 --> 0:34:12,517
somebody's been a
- keeping a secret in a closet.


506
0:34:12,517 --> 0:34:15,52
And I'm thinking maybe it's a
picture of something she's a-needing.


507
0:34:15,52 --> 0:34:16,854
So the first thing
I'm gonna do...


508
0:34:16,854 --> 0:34:18,189
Oh, no. Now, Dave.


509
0:34:18,189 --> 0:34:19,524
Yes, now.


510
0:34:19,524 --> 0:34:23,61
Dave, don't.


511
0:34:23,61 --> 0:34:25,496
Dave.
Can't hear. Both ears is bad.


512
0:34:25,496 --> 0:34:27,565
If you go in that closet...


513
0:34:27,565 --> 0:34:36,307
Next time I'll puff you
clean over to Coon Hollow.


514
0:34:36,307 --> 0:34:37,842
If you go in there, I'll
never talk to you again.


515
0:34:37,842 --> 0:34:39,944
Why, it's only fun. There
ain't nothing in there you want.


516
0:34:39,944 --> 0:34:41,746
Nothing that'd be important to you. June.


517
0:34:41,746 --> 0:34:43,114
Never.
I only want to buy...


518
0:34:43,114 --> 0:34:45,316
Never.


519
0:34:45,316 --> 0:34:52,79
Dave.


520
0:34:52,79 --> 0:34:55,426
You're sure pretty.


521
0:34:55,426 --> 0:34:56,994
Am I?


522
0:34:56,994 --> 0:35:0,164
Like a budding sapling without
even room for a robin to sit.


523
0:35:0,164 --> 0:35:3,101
You're just silly.


524
0:35:3,101 --> 0:35:6,27
I been silly ever since the
sap come up out of the trees.


525
0:35:6,27 --> 0:35:8,539
I get silly
just looking at you.


526
0:35:8,539 --> 0:35:10,208
When we get married...


527
0:35:10,208 --> 0:35:11,342
It ain't green up yet.


528
0:35:11,342 --> 0:35:12,877
You're going to have ivory combs in your hair


529
0:35:12,877 --> 0:35:14,512
and you're gonna have
blood-red wine to drink.


530
0:35:14,512 --> 0:35:16,47
Wine?


531
0:35:16,47 --> 0:35:18,549
And down by the sty,
we'll build a big house...


532
0:35:18,549 --> 0:35:22,153
With grass growing
all the way down?


533
0:35:22,153 --> 0:35:24,655
The ivory combs,
they was my idea.


534
0:35:24,655 --> 0:35:26,757
And the big house?


535
0:35:26,757 --> 0:35:28,226
Mr. Hale.
He thought of that.


536
0:35:28,226 --> 0:35:29,66
He's drawn me
a piece of paper.


537
0:35:29,66 --> 0:35:30,995
It's got a bathtub
in it, June.


538
0:35:30,995 --> 0:35:32,296
In the middle
of the house it is.


539
0:35:32,296 --> 0:35:34,866
And it's get water that can
be turned on with the handle.


540
0:35:34,866 --> 0:35:36,467
And there's a room where
you keep babies, and it's...


541
0:35:36,467 --> 0:35:38,703
Get out of here, Dave.


542
0:35:38,703 --> 0:35:42,473
Honey.


543
0:35:42,473 --> 0:35:46,344
Dave, please.


544
0:35:46,344 --> 0:36:15,973
Sure.


545
0:36:15,973 --> 0:36:17,909
<i>Love is everywhere</i>


546
0:36:17,909 --> 0:36:21,212
<i>Its music fills the air</i>


547
0:36:21,212 --> 0:36:28,719
<i>All nature seems to hum</i>
<i>"A melody from the sky!"</i>


548
0:36:28,719 --> 0:36:33,991
<i>Over on the hill,</i>
<i>I see a whippoorwill</i>


549
0:36:33,991 --> 0:36:40,231
<i>I hear its song become</i>
<i>"A melody from the sky!"</i>


550
0:36:40,231 --> 0:36:47,438
<i>And there's a bluebird</i> <i>singing
to</i> <i>his lady love above</i>


551
0:36:47,438 --> 0:36:49,54
<i>A love song</i>


552
0:36:49,54 --> 0:36:54,979
<i>taken from</i> <i>the whispering
breeze</i> <i>in the trees</i>


553
0:36:54,979 --> 0:36:57,381
<i>Love is everywhere</i>


554
0:36:57,381 --> 0:37:0,618
<i>Its music fills the air</i>


555
0:37:0,618 --> 0:37:4,722
<i>All nature seems to hum</i>


556
0:37:4,722 --> 0:37:9,827
<i>"A melody from the sky!"</i>


557
0:37:9,827 --> 0:37:12,396
By Juckies, that's what I
call whistling and singing.


558
0:37:12,396 --> 0:37:15,199
I'm awful glad
to see you, Tater.


559
0:37:15,199 --> 0:37:16,734
Well, you never was before.


560
0:37:16,734 --> 0:37:18,202
You've changed.
You're different.


561
0:37:18,202 --> 0:37:20,671
You're... I'm awful glad to see you.


562
0:37:20,671 --> 0:37:21,806
You said that.


563
0:37:21,806 --> 0:37:24,475
Did I?
Well, I am glad.


564
0:37:24,475 --> 0:37:27,144
Well, here he is, safe
and delivered. So long.


565
0:37:27,144 --> 0:37:28,546
Bye, Tater.


566
0:37:28,546 --> 0:37:31,249
Goodbye, engineer. And don't
forget what Mr. Hale told you.


567
0:37:31,249 --> 0:37:33,684
Watch the steam
in your boiler.


568
0:37:33,684 --> 0:37:36,187
<i>Love is everywhere</i>


569
0:37:36,187 --> 0:37:40,24
<i>Its music fills the air</i>


570
0:37:40,24 --> 0:37:49,5
<i>All nature seems to hum</i>
<i>"A melody from the sky!"</i>


571
0:37:49,5 --> 0:38:3,18
<i>Love is everywhere</i>


572
0:38:3,18 --> 0:38:8,319
David, get away
from there.


573
0:38:8,319 --> 0:38:12,79
Dave, you ain't said nothing
about my steam shovel.


574
0:38:12,79 --> 0:38:15,59
Your... Is that what it is?


575
0:38:15,59 --> 0:38:17,94
Yeah. It works, too.


576
0:38:17,94 --> 0:38:18,796
Uncle Jack,
he showed me...


577
0:38:18,796 --> 0:38:20,398
Uncle Jack?


578
0:38:20,398 --> 0:38:26,7
Uh-huh. Mr. Hale. You know. He
said, "When this thing gets up here,


579
0:38:26,7 --> 0:38:30,574
"you got to pull this thing."
See? See how it works?


580
0:38:30,574 --> 0:38:32,943
Hemlocks. Mr. Hale's sure smart, ain't he?


581
0:38:32,943 --> 0:38:39,483
Bet he is. Sis, she says he's
the smartestest man she ever seen.


582
0:38:39,483 --> 0:38:43,788
She said what?


583
0:38:43,788 --> 0:38:45,923
Sure works, don't it?


584
0:38:45,923 --> 0:38:51,128
I'm wanna be an engineer,
too, when I get big.


585
0:38:51,128 --> 0:38:55,366
When did June say
that about Mr. Hale?


586
0:38:55,366 --> 0:38:59,67
She says it all the time, every day
at most, when she takes me down there.


587
0:38:59,67 --> 0:39:1,806
She takes you
down there every day?


588
0:39:1,806 --> 0:39:4,675
Uh-huh.
I sit with Corsey, I do.


589
0:39:4,675 --> 0:39:6,43
Corsey?


590
0:39:6,43 --> 0:39:7,578
He's an engineer.


591
0:39:7,578 --> 0:39:12,116
He's the best, he is.


592
0:39:12,116 --> 0:39:15,853
What does June do when
you're with Corsey, Buddie?


593
0:39:15,853 --> 0:39:17,855
She goes walking
with Uncle Jack.


594
0:39:17,855 --> 0:39:23,194
They don't
bother me at all.


595
0:39:23,194 --> 0:39:25,629
Now watch me.
Tuffy, go on.


596
0:39:25,629 --> 0:39:28,532
Go get some coal.


597
0:39:28,532 --> 0:39:31,335
Go on,
go get some coal.


598
0:39:31,335 --> 0:39:33,204
Oh! Buddie.


599
0:39:33,204 --> 0:39:36,574
Huh?


600
0:39:36,574 --> 0:40:55,619
Nothing.


601
0:40:55,619 --> 0:40:57,721
Mr. Thurber,
Mr. Thurber.


602
0:40:57,721 --> 0:41:0,291
Hello, Buddie.


603
0:41:0,291 --> 0:41:2,159
I hope he ain't no bother
to you, Mr. Thurber.


604
0:41:2,159 --> 0:41:3,994
Bother! Really
I'm compelled to laugh.


605
0:41:3,994 --> 0:41:5,529
This charming
little fellow.


606
0:41:5,529 --> 0:41:6,797
Ridiculous, Miss Tolliver.


607
0:41:6,797 --> 0:41:8,532
It's only when you've
seen the world like I have,


608
0:41:8,532 --> 0:41:10,901
that you learn to appreciate
the laughter of children.


609
0:41:10,901 --> 0:41:13,404
Their childish pranks
and their naive questions.


610
0:41:13,404 --> 0:41:16,24
I remember once on the boat
coming over from England.


611
0:41:16,24 --> 0:41:19,76
There was dear little curly-headed
fellow, he must have been about...


612
0:41:19,76 --> 0:41:22,646
June, there's
Mr. Corsey.


613
0:41:22,646 --> 0:41:24,982
Corsey.


614
0:41:24,982 --> 0:41:27,117
Howdy, son.
What's holding you up?


615
0:41:27,117 --> 0:41:30,754
Come on.


616
0:41:30,754 --> 0:41:32,623
How are you this morning?
All right.


617
0:41:32,623 --> 0:41:35,159
Atta boy!
Whoops-a-daisy.


618
0:41:35,159 --> 0:41:36,594
Charming child.


619
0:41:36,594 --> 0:41:45,269
Yes.


620
0:41:45,269 --> 0:41:46,57
Mr. Thurber, you better check with Mills


621
0:41:46,57 --> 0:41:47,838
about that last
carload of ties.


622
0:41:47,838 --> 0:41:52,776
They weren't creosoted.
They can't...


623
0:41:52,776 --> 0:41:54,178
Again?


624
0:41:54,178 --> 0:41:58,449
Mmm-hmm.


625
0:41:58,449 --> 0:42:3,87
I'm busy.
Come on, get up.


626
0:42:3,87 --> 0:42:4,255
You can see that,
can't you?


627
0:42:4,255 --> 0:42:5,723
Uh-huh.


628
0:42:5,723 --> 0:42:6,891
Well?


629
0:42:6,891 --> 0:42:8,25
Mmm-hmm.


630
0:42:8,25 --> 0:42:10,361
You call that an answer?
Mmm-hmm.


631
0:42:10,361 --> 0:42:12,29
Listen,
Miss Uh-uh and Uh-huh.


632
0:42:12,29 --> 0:42:13,664
Outside, up the hill
to your family.


633
0:42:13,664 --> 0:42:15,232
You've probably got
plenty of work to do.


634
0:42:15,232 --> 0:42:19,27
And don't say uh-huh.
Uh-uh.


635
0:42:19,27 --> 0:42:20,404
Woman, you're a nut.


636
0:42:20,404 --> 0:42:21,872
Good. I like that.


637
0:42:21,872 --> 0:42:23,4
You like being a nut.


638
0:42:23,4 --> 0:42:24,141
No, being a woman.


639
0:42:24,141 --> 0:42:26,21
Until now, you've been
thinking I'm a girl.


640
0:42:26,21 --> 0:42:28,846
You're not a woman.
You're not even a girl.


641
0:42:28,846 --> 0:42:30,347
I ain't?


642
0:42:30,347 --> 0:42:34,151
No, you're just a child
no bigger than that.


643
0:42:34,151 --> 0:42:35,719
And from here up?


644
0:42:35,719 --> 0:42:37,888
I'm not fooling you. I'm
going to tell you something.


645
0:42:37,888 --> 0:42:40,424
What do you do
with your spare time?


646
0:42:40,424 --> 0:42:45,563
This is very interesting.


647
0:42:45,563 --> 0:42:46,897
Now, stop your clowning.


648
0:42:46,897 --> 0:42:48,532
June, you're making
a big mistake.


649
0:42:48,532 --> 0:42:49,767
Pretty soon
you'll be married to Dave,


650
0:42:49,767 --> 0:42:51,101
and what have
you done about it?


651
0:42:51,101 --> 0:42:53,537
What do you want me to do?


652
0:42:53,537 --> 0:42:55,172
I want you to
go to school.


653
0:42:55,172 --> 0:42:56,974
To what?
School.


654
0:42:56,974 --> 0:43:0,11
Can't you realize what the future
holds for you and your family?


655
0:43:0,11 --> 0:43:1,345
Uh-huh.


656
0:43:1,345 --> 0:43:4,381
All right, what?
A fight with the Falins.


657
0:43:4,381 --> 0:43:6,884
You're impossible.


658
0:43:6,884 --> 0:43:8,185
I ain't impossible.


659
0:43:8,185 --> 0:43:9,42
I'd like to know
what you'd call it.


660
0:43:9,42 --> 0:43:10,588
I can listen.


661
0:43:10,588 --> 0:43:11,689
You can?


662
0:43:11,689 --> 0:43:13,524
All right, listen to this.
Look at Buddie.


663
0:43:13,524 --> 0:43:15,526
He's a swell little kid
and he's smart as a whip.


664
0:43:15,526 --> 0:43:17,261
He'll learn
and he'll learn fast.


665
0:43:17,261 --> 0:43:19,43
And the minute he arrives,
these mountains can't hold him.


666
0:43:19,43 --> 0:43:21,332
He'll change, June, and
you'll he proud of him,


667
0:43:21,332 --> 0:43:24,735
but you'll be unhappy too because
he'll speak a different language.


668
0:43:24,735 --> 0:43:28,205
You're smart and
I can understand you.


669
0:43:28,205 --> 0:43:29,807
Look, June, I'm not trying
to hurt your feelings.


670
0:43:29,807 --> 0:43:31,542
I think
you're a swell girl.


671
0:43:31,542 --> 0:43:32,843
But if you ever
were in the city once,


672
0:43:32,843 --> 0:43:34,812
just once, you'd understand what I mean.


673
0:43:34,812 --> 0:43:36,447
Remember what
you told me yesterday.


674
0:43:36,447 --> 0:43:38,115
None of you
could read that check.


675
0:43:38,115 --> 0:43:39,783
$5,000.
But you just guessed at it


676
0:43:39,783 --> 0:43:41,852
because there was a picture
of a coal mine on it.


677
0:43:41,852 --> 0:43:43,12
And from now on,
Dave and your father


678
0:43:43,12 --> 0:43:44,355
will be getting
lots of letters.


679
0:43:44,355 --> 0:43:46,156
See what I mean?


680
0:43:46,156 --> 0:43:47,458
I ain't going to no town.


681
0:43:47,458 --> 0:43:49,994
You don't have to. You can get
some books and read at home.


682
0:43:49,994 --> 0:43:51,161
Hire a teacher.


683
0:43:51,161 --> 0:43:53,163
You've got money,
and you'll have more.


684
0:43:53,163 --> 0:43:54,698
And once you get into it,
you'll be so blamed happy


685
0:43:54,698 --> 0:43:56,367
you'll want to
give me a big hug.


686
0:43:56,367 --> 0:44:5,376
Would I?


687
0:44:5,376 --> 0:44:9,46
Hello.
Hale speaking, Operator.


688
0:44:9,46 --> 0:44:11,715
Hello, Lewis.
What's on your mind?


689
0:44:11,715 --> 0:44:13,884
You what?


690
0:44:13,884 --> 0:44:16,387
You want me to
come to town?


691
0:44:16,387 --> 0:44:18,22
Listen, I've got
some bulldogs up here


692
0:44:18,22 --> 0:44:19,857
by the name of
Tolliver and Falin.


693
0:44:19,857 --> 0:44:22,159
And if I leave...


694
0:44:22,159 --> 0:44:24,728
Yeah, Lewis, but I...


695
0:44:24,728 --> 0:44:26,73
Oh...


696
0:44:26,73 --> 0:44:28,799
All right. Yeah.


697
0:44:28,799 --> 0:44:31,869
I'll leave in the morning.
Right.


698
0:44:31,869 --> 0:44:34,571
Hey, wait a minute.
What about those ties?


699
0:44:34,571 --> 0:44:40,77
You did, huh?


700
0:44:40,77 --> 0:44:41,812
Okay, I'll see you soon.


701
0:44:41,812 --> 0:44:56,86
Well, June,
it looks like...


702
0:44:56,86 --> 0:44:59,363
The mountains is good enough for
us. They're good enough for you.


703
0:44:59,363 --> 0:45:0,698
You ain't
a- going to town.


704
0:45:0,698 --> 0:45:1,999
But, Judd...


705
0:45:1,999 --> 0:45:4,702
I'm a-talking.
The idea.


706
0:45:4,702 --> 0:45:7,805
You getting close to marrying
time and wanting to go to school.


707
0:45:7,805 --> 0:45:10,741
You gonna make clabber cheese any
better if you can read and write?


708
0:45:10,741 --> 0:45:13,477
Or churn butter or fix a shirt or mend socks?


709
0:45:13,477 --> 0:45:15,646
That's what a wife
is supposed to do.


710
0:45:15,646 --> 0:45:18,382
Don't take no education to show
you where a hen lays her eggs.


711
0:45:18,382 --> 0:45:19,75
I ain't gonna listen
to any more.


712
0:45:19,75 --> 0:45:23,787
June.


713
0:45:23,787 --> 0:45:25,656
Yeah, and you can use it
till the blood comes.


714
0:45:25,656 --> 0:45:27,91
But I won't change my mind.


715
0:45:27,91 --> 0:45:28,292
You and the mountains
ain't going to make


716
0:45:28,292 --> 0:45:30,527
no dried up
cornstalk out of me.


717
0:45:30,527 --> 0:45:32,73
You ain't got the right.


718
0:45:32,73 --> 0:45:35,332
I'm gonna be smart
and I'm gonna think.


719
0:45:35,332 --> 0:45:37,534
Yes, I am. And I'm gonna be a help to Dave


720
0:45:37,534 --> 0:45:39,269
when those checks
start coming in.


721
0:45:39,269 --> 0:45:41,605
You ain't ever been to the city.
You don't know what it means.


722
0:45:41,605 --> 0:45:43,407
You're going to
stay here.


723
0:45:43,407 --> 0:45:44,942
And be a cull,
just like Mammy?


724
0:45:44,942 --> 0:45:47,578
June.


725
0:45:47,578 --> 0:45:49,48
She knows
what I'm driving at.


726
0:45:49,48 --> 0:45:51,315
She ain't never
get to go no place.


727
0:45:51,315 --> 0:45:53,283
Just stayed here
and dried up.


728
0:45:53,283 --> 0:45:55,18
Getting older,
faster than she should.


729
0:45:55,18 --> 0:45:56,32
Weren't you, Mammy?


730
0:45:56,32 --> 0:45:58,822
I was born old.


731
0:45:58,822 --> 0:46:1,91
She could have been
young and beautiful.


732
0:46:1,91 --> 0:46:5,95
She is beautiful.
Listen, June child.


733
0:46:5,95 --> 0:46:7,97
I ain't no mean father.


734
0:46:7,97 --> 0:46:9,967
I mean, I ain't
a never wanting to be.


735
0:46:9,967 --> 0:46:13,837
You looked at me just
like a stranger, just now.


736
0:46:13,837 --> 0:46:17,908
Kind of hurt inside.


737
0:46:17,908 --> 0:46:24,314
Pappy.


738
0:46:24,314 --> 0:46:26,784
Sure be glad to give you a lift, Miss June.


739
0:46:26,784 --> 0:46:29,52
This animal of mine will carry
double and get you to Gaptown


740
0:46:29,52 --> 0:46:31,789
quicker than a hound dog
can smell a pole cat.


741
0:46:31,789 --> 0:46:33,457
That's very nice
of you, Mr. Keever


742
0:46:33,457 --> 0:46:35,959
but I'm a-waiting,
a friend, you know.


743
0:46:35,959 --> 0:46:38,228
Oh!


744
0:46:38,228 --> 0:46:41,331
The smell of winter's stouter
than horse radish.


745
0:46:41,331 --> 0:46:43,734
Hope it don't
kick up a rain.


746
0:46:43,734 --> 0:47:16,9
Goodbye.
Bye.


747
0:47:16,9 --> 0:47:18,68
Where you going?


748
0:47:18,68 --> 0:47:19,937
That a way.


749
0:47:19,937 --> 0:47:21,171
Just a stroll?


750
0:47:21,171 --> 0:47:23,507
Oh, no. Going to town.


751
0:47:23,507 --> 0:47:32,382
Smell of winter's
stouter than horse radish.


752
0:47:32,382 --> 0:47:34,184
Thought you told me
you'd never been to town.


753
0:47:34,184 --> 0:47:36,119
Might, might not.


754
0:47:36,119 --> 0:47:38,355
Hope it don't
kick up a rain.


755
0:47:38,355 --> 0:47:41,692
I give up.
Come on, get in.


756
0:47:41,692 --> 0:47:44,261
No. I wouldn't. It might be putting you out.


757
0:47:44,261 --> 0:47:46,33
It's only a short hop
and a tussle to town.


758
0:47:46,33 --> 0:47:53,403
Get in.


759
0:47:53,403 --> 0:47:55,839
Say, if it's any of my business,
why are you going to town?


760
0:47:55,839 --> 0:47:58,909
Education. Do you have to keep
your foot on the brake all the time?


761
0:47:58,909 --> 0:48:0,611
When did you
get that idea?


762
0:48:0,611 --> 0:48:1,945
I see you keep
jiggling it back and...


763
0:48:1,945 --> 0:48:4,314
You know what I mean.
When?


764
0:48:4,314 --> 0:48:5,782
Talking to people.


765
0:48:5,782 --> 0:48:7,117
Who?


766
0:48:7,117 --> 0:48:8,919
Oh, about.


767
0:48:8,919 --> 0:48:11,889
It was what
I told you, wasn't it?


768
0:48:11,889 --> 0:48:13,49
Did you?


769
0:48:13,49 --> 0:48:14,858
Yes, you was
one of them.


770
0:48:14,858 --> 0:48:16,56
I was all of them.


771
0:48:16,56 --> 0:48:19,897
Now see here, I meant what
I said. I sincerely meant it.


772
0:48:19,897 --> 0:48:21,965
But you're up to
something phony.


773
0:48:21,965 --> 0:48:23,934
People don't just get
an idea and then go.


774
0:48:23,934 --> 0:48:27,204
Did you ever stand under a falling
tree or see a pole cat back up?


775
0:48:27,204 --> 0:48:28,972
That's not funny.


776
0:48:28,972 --> 0:48:30,707
What did your father
say about it, and Dave?


777
0:48:30,707 --> 0:48:33,143
They was mostly agreeing,
especially Dave.


778
0:48:33,143 --> 0:48:34,745
He said when those checks
start traipsing in...


779
0:48:34,745 --> 0:48:36,914
I said that.


780
0:48:36,914 --> 0:48:48,659
All right, I'll walk.


781
0:48:48,659 --> 0:48:50,46
Same thing eating you?


782
0:48:50,46 --> 0:48:51,862
Huh?


783
0:48:51,862 --> 0:48:53,997
Sure makes me
feel bad.


784
0:48:53,997 --> 0:48:55,866
That's what I wanna
talk to you about.


785
0:48:55,866 --> 0:48:57,935
Nice of you. Horse gets out of the barn


786
0:48:57,935 --> 0:48:59,937
and now you want to
lock the door.


787
0:48:59,937 --> 0:49:2,239
Well, he ain't
got her yet.


788
0:49:2,239 --> 0:49:4,441
Who ain't got what...
Wait a minute.


789
0:49:4,441 --> 0:49:6,443
Ain't you and I talking
about the same thing?


790
0:49:6,443 --> 0:49:8,445
You bet we're talking
about the same thing.


791
0:49:8,445 --> 0:49:9,913
I was feeling
when he saved my life


792
0:49:9,913 --> 0:49:12,49
but I just didn't know
what it was then.


793
0:49:12,49 --> 0:49:16,153
Fever I says. Or maybe the lead's
splashing something in my eyes.


794
0:49:16,153 --> 0:49:18,155
But I ought to have known. It
was him being nice to Buddie.


795
0:49:18,155 --> 0:49:19,623
It was him...
Wait a minute, son.


796
0:49:19,623 --> 0:49:21,291
You're making
a gourd trap,


797
0:49:21,291 --> 0:49:24,962
but it's too big to catch meadow
larks and too small to catch ideas.


798
0:49:24,962 --> 0:49:26,697
What are you
talking about?


799
0:49:26,697 --> 0:49:27,864
Let's get June
right here.


800
0:49:27,864 --> 0:49:30,67
We ones is going to settle
this matter for good.


801
0:49:30,67 --> 0:49:32,402
You want her here?
Fine.


802
0:49:32,402 --> 0:49:33,937
You tell her
she could go to town,


803
0:49:33,937 --> 0:49:35,439
now you tell me
you want her here.


804
0:49:35,439 --> 0:49:36,84
Ain't you
a little tetched?


805
0:49:36,84 --> 0:49:38,41
I tell her
she can go where?


806
0:49:38,41 --> 0:49:39,543
Into town
to get educated.


807
0:49:39,543 --> 0:49:41,478
Got to read books,
she said you said.


808
0:49:41,478 --> 0:49:44,181
Don't want no cull for a
wife, she said you said.


809
0:49:44,181 --> 0:49:45,682
She said...
She ain't gone.


810
0:49:45,682 --> 0:49:46,783
You didn't
let her go, did you?


811
0:49:46,783 --> 0:49:48,919
Of course, been gone
maybe two hours now.


812
0:49:48,919 --> 0:49:51,254
Took her down to the ridge
to meet the mailman.


813
0:49:51,254 --> 0:49:53,23
She said...
It was him that done it.


814
0:49:53,23 --> 0:49:54,558
Him that said
he was our friend.


815
0:49:54,558 --> 0:49:56,26
That's why
he gave us the money.


816
0:49:56,26 --> 0:49:58,328
That's why he gave us
the money. You understand?


817
0:49:58,328 --> 0:49:59,396
He took her away.


818
0:49:59,396 --> 0:50:1,498
He's been wanting to take
her, but he was a-feared.


819
0:50:1,498 --> 0:50:2,866
All right.


820
0:50:2,866 --> 0:50:4,768
He thinks now maybe the money
will keep us from telling him


821
0:50:4,768 --> 0:50:7,27
that we ones up here
don't take nobody's woman.


822
0:50:7,27 --> 0:50:9,206
Money ain't
a- stopping us from that.


823
0:50:9,206 --> 0:50:10,307
Money ain't
a- stopping us from...


824
0:50:10,307 --> 0:50:12,809
Where are you going?


825
0:50:12,809 --> 0:50:19,85
I'm going hunting.


826
0:50:19,85 --> 0:50:21,818
You're sure
that was Dave Tolliver?


827
0:50:21,818 --> 0:50:24,888
He was a-headed for the camp
and across our property, too.


828
0:50:24,888 --> 0:50:27,624
If he's down there,
he's on our property.


829
0:50:27,624 --> 0:50:29,593
Might just as well
go down and look into it.


830
0:50:29,593 --> 0:50:31,94
That's my job.


831
0:50:31,94 --> 0:50:33,73
I've been sort of shamed since
I only get him in the arm.


832
0:50:33,73 --> 0:50:35,132
You're right.


833
0:50:35,132 --> 0:50:41,171
Rub out
the mistake, Son.


834
0:50:41,171 --> 0:50:43,14
So help me,
he isn't here.


835
0:50:43,14 --> 0:50:45,609
On my word of honor, he isn't
here. Do you understand me?


836
0:50:45,609 --> 0:50:46,843
Yeah.


837
0:50:46,843 --> 0:50:49,513
He went downtown.
Down to Gaptown, I mean.


838
0:50:49,513 --> 0:50:51,381
She didn't go with him?
No, I told you!


839
0:50:51,381 --> 0:50:53,316
He was alone, and... You sure
they didn't meet some place?


840
0:50:53,316 --> 0:50:54,918
With these, I saw him.


841
0:50:54,918 --> 0:50:58,388
He got into his wagon,
on this side...


842
0:50:58,388 --> 0:50:59,556
You ain't
answering my question.


843
0:50:59,556 --> 0:51:1,491
I can't answer
that 'cause I don't know.


844
0:51:1,491 --> 0:51:2,959
I watched him
there on the road.


845
0:51:2,959 --> 0:52:25,775
There was nobody
with him then, because...


846
0:52:25,775 --> 0:52:27,11
Mr. Thurber,
I'm a-quitting.


847
0:52:27,11 --> 0:52:28,311
No, you're not.


848
0:52:28,311 --> 0:52:29,88
In times like this,
you gotta be a man.


849
0:52:29,88 --> 0:52:31,214
A man must
never been a coward.


850
0:52:31,214 --> 0:52:33,683
I got to get to Gaptown to tell
the people down there what's up.


851
0:52:33,683 --> 0:52:35,619
But it's over.
There's nothing to tell!


852
0:52:35,619 --> 0:52:37,454
There ain't, eh?
You don't know.


853
0:52:37,454 --> 0:52:40,524
Look at here, Dave Tolliver's
gone to Gaptown to get Mr. Hale.


854
0:52:40,524 --> 0:52:42,259
He bust Wade Falin
on the beak.


855
0:52:42,259 --> 0:52:45,61
And when a Tolliver busts a
Falin on the beak, that means war.


856
0:52:45,61 --> 0:52:46,663
And I gotta tell
a- people in Gaptown,


857
0:52:46,663 --> 0:52:49,933
so they can
scuttle for safety.


858
0:52:49,933 --> 0:52:58,508
Good heavens!


859
0:52:58,508 --> 0:53:0,577
Jenkins.


860
0:53:0,577 --> 0:53:2,412
Jenkins.


861
0:53:2,412 --> 0:53:4,548
Biggest fight.
Outside camp.


862
0:53:4,548 --> 0:53:9,419
Wade Falin came down...
Dave Tolliver...


863
0:53:9,419 --> 0:53:18,862
And shoved him
over the cliff...


864
0:53:18,862 --> 0:53:21,431
I knew that thing was
going to break out again.


865
0:53:21,431 --> 0:53:29,94
Just a matter of time
and that's all we needed.


866
0:53:29,94 --> 0:53:31,408
And I was standing
right there.


867
0:53:31,408 --> 0:53:32,742
I heard enough.


868
0:53:32,742 --> 0:53:45,155
And he...


869
0:53:45,155 --> 0:53:46,69
Dave Tolliver
licked Wade Falin.


870
0:53:46,69 --> 0:53:55,365
And now he's coming
to get Mr. Hale.


871
0:53:55,365 --> 0:54:4,7
Whoa!


872
0:54:4,7 --> 0:54:5,742
Is there anything else you need? No.


873
0:54:5,742 --> 0:54:7,277
Well, if you think of
anything, just call the camp


874
0:54:7,277 --> 0:54:9,546
and I'll have one of
the men bring it down.


875
0:54:9,546 --> 0:54:11,915
I'm sorry, but...
Well?


876
0:54:11,915 --> 0:54:14,317
The room, you know, where Miss
Tolliver was going to stay...


877
0:54:14,317 --> 0:54:15,885
Well, that room,
I'm afraid...


878
0:54:15,885 --> 0:54:16,987
Afraid of what?


879
0:54:16,987 --> 0:54:18,321
Well, it ain't
a fitting place.


880
0:54:18,321 --> 0:54:19,589
It kind of leaks,
you know.


881
0:54:19,589 --> 0:54:22,592
Hold it. There's trouble,
ain't there?


882
0:54:22,592 --> 0:54:23,827
Trouble?


883
0:54:23,827 --> 0:54:25,962
I can smell it.
What's wrong?


884
0:54:25,962 --> 0:54:27,397
I don't want
no fighting.


885
0:54:27,397 --> 0:54:28,531
Fighting?


886
0:54:28,531 --> 0:54:30,2
Dave.


887
0:54:30,2 --> 0:54:31,368
Say, what is this?


888
0:54:31,368 --> 0:54:32,502
He's coming to get me.


889
0:54:32,502 --> 0:54:34,304
Who told you?
You've seen him?


890
0:54:34,304 --> 0:54:40,31
All town knows it. And I don't
want no trouble around here.


891
0:54:40,31 --> 0:54:41,745
You gotta go.


892
0:54:41,745 --> 0:54:43,146
I've got to what?


893
0:54:43,146 --> 0:54:47,5
I know... I've seen him the
time he shot down Jim Falin.


894
0:54:47,5 --> 0:54:48,251
You gotta
get out of town.


895
0:54:48,251 --> 0:54:50,153
What have I done to him that
he should want to harm me?


896
0:54:50,153 --> 0:54:51,354
Did I ever
do anything to him?


897
0:54:51,354 --> 0:54:52,522
No, you didn't.


898
0:54:52,522 --> 0:54:56,159
But I wish
I hadn't come down.


899
0:54:56,159 --> 0:54:57,761
Will you go?
Please go.


900
0:54:57,761 --> 0:54:58,862
You lied, didn't you?


901
0:54:58,862 --> 0:55:0,93
Everything you said coming
down out of the mountains?


902
0:55:0,93 --> 0:55:2,632
I knew you were lying then,
and something inside of me


903
0:55:2,632 --> 0:55:5,1
told me I should have
sent you home.


904
0:55:5,1 --> 0:55:7,103
Well, let him come.


905
0:55:7,103 --> 0:55:9,839
I never saw such a ferocious
look in a man's eyes in my life.


906
0:55:9,839 --> 0:55:16,212
I tell you, it's gonna be
the biggest fight of the year.


907
0:55:16,212 --> 0:55:18,715
Dave... Dave come out
of the tent, like a shot.


908
0:55:18,715 --> 0:55:20,317
He lit right on
top of Wade.


909
0:55:20,317 --> 0:55:22,852
And rammed down on him with
a right and left! Right!


910
0:55:22,852 --> 0:55:24,521
Wade got away from Dave.


911
0:55:24,521 --> 0:55:26,356
Dave got him right on the edge
of the cliff, he had him down,


912
0:55:26,356 --> 0:55:27,457
he was beating his head down and he says,


913
0:55:27,457 --> 0:55:29,92
"I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill you!


914
0:55:29,92 --> 0:55:30,493
"You'll take my girl,
will you?"


915
0:55:30,493 --> 0:55:33,63
He reached him up
and he says...


916
0:55:33,63 --> 0:55:35,532
Nice day, ain't it?


917
0:55:35,532 --> 0:55:39,269
Give me a beer.


918
0:55:39,269 --> 0:55:41,838
I gotta see somebody.


919
0:55:41,838 --> 0:55:44,407
Yeah, Dave Tolliver.


920
0:55:44,407 --> 0:55:47,41
And how'd you like to
tell him we was here.


921
0:55:47,41 --> 0:56:5,362
In the backroom.


922
0:56:5,362 --> 0:56:8,231
There's Dave Tolliver
coming in now.


923
0:56:8,231 --> 0:56:9,566
And he ain't going out.


924
0:56:9,566 --> 0:56:10,834
You can get him
right from here.


925
0:56:10,834 --> 0:56:13,503
We don't have to sneak
our shots at the Tolliver.


926
0:56:13,503 --> 0:56:15,171
Stay here, Wade.


927
0:56:15,171 --> 0:56:18,241
Hell.


928
0:56:18,241 --> 0:56:27,317
You sing about Stack O'Lee
and keep right on singing.


929
0:56:27,317 --> 0:56:30,72
<i>When the rain</i>
<i>was falling fast</i>


930
0:56:30,72 --> 0:56:33,69
<i>One dark and stormy night</i>


931
0:56:33,69 --> 0:56:40,163
<i>Stack O'Lee and Billy Lyons</i>
<i>Had an awful fight</i>


932
0:56:40,163 --> 0:56:49,773
<i>Bad, bad,</i>
<i>bad old Stack O'Lee</i>


933
0:56:49,773 --> 0:56:52,41
You ain't going to do nothing,
Dave. It's all my fault.


934
0:56:52,41 --> 0:56:53,977
Talk will keep.


935
0:56:53,977 --> 0:56:55,445
Now, let's get
this thing straight.


936
0:56:55,445 --> 0:56:57,113
You're down here
looking for trouble.


937
0:56:57,113 --> 0:56:59,616
I haven't done anything, but I
can see you won't believe that.


938
0:56:59,616 --> 0:57:6,523
All right.


939
0:57:6,523 --> 0:57:22,338
This is worth walking for.


940
0:57:22,338 --> 0:57:25,175
How are you doing, Buck?
Drop them gun.


941
0:57:25,175 --> 0:57:27,43
We're going about
our own business.


942
0:57:27,43 --> 0:57:30,246
Of course, you are.
Put them down.


943
0:57:30,246 --> 0:57:32,48
Certainly.


944
0:57:32,48 --> 0:57:34,35
Anything to oblige.


945
0:57:34,35 --> 0:57:36,719
Funny you ain't trying
to stop the fight.


946
0:57:36,719 --> 0:57:39,656
Fist fight
won't do no harm.


947
0:57:39,656 --> 0:57:41,825
Gun toting don't go.


948
0:57:41,825 --> 0:57:44,794
No hard feeling.


949
0:57:44,794 --> 0:57:46,963
No.


950
0:57:46,963 --> 0:58:13,189
No.


951
0:58:13,189 --> 0:58:25,602
You're doing a good job, Mr.
Hale. Maybe we can help you.


952
0:58:25,602 --> 0:58:27,804
So that's the way
it is, huh?


953
0:58:27,804 --> 0:58:28,872
Any way
you wanna look at it.


954
0:58:28,872 --> 0:58:40,617
You shouldn't
mess in old troubles.


955
0:58:40,617 --> 0:58:43,887
<i>Dogs did howl</i>


956
0:58:43,887 --> 0:58:46,723
<i>Dogs did bark</i>


957
0:58:46,723 --> 0:58:49,792
<i>When Stack O'Lee</i>
<i>the murderer</i>


958
0:58:49,792 --> 0:58:53,229
<i>went creeping</i>
<i>through the dark</i>


959
0:58:53,229 --> 0:59:22,825
<i>Bad, bad,</i>
<i>bad old Stack O'Lee</i>


960
0:59:22,825 --> 0:59:24,527
Get out of here
and take her with you!


961
0:59:24,527 --> 0:59:27,931
I can run from no Falin.


962
0:59:27,931 --> 0:59:32,368
I guess, here in the mountains
a woman doesn't mean very much.


963
0:59:32,368 --> 0:59:39,342
You came here to get her, didn't you?


964
0:59:39,342 --> 0:59:42,845
<i>Bam, bam, bam, bam</i>


965
0:59:42,845 --> 0:59:45,982
<i>Went Stack's. 44</i>


966
0:59:45,982 --> 0:59:48,718
<i>Next time I saw Billy Lyons</i>


967
0:59:48,718 --> 0:59:52,55
<i>He's stretched out</i>
<i>on the floor</i>


968
0:59:52,55 --> 0:59:58,394
<i>Bad, bad,</i>
<i>bad old Stack O'Lee</i>


969
0:59:58,394 --> 1:0:0,73
<i>Stop your drinking whiskey</i>


970
1:0:0,73 --> 1:0:3,333
<i>With your...</i>


971
1:0:3,333 --> 1:0:11,908
<i>Look what happened</i>
<i>to poor old Stack O'Lee</i>


972
1:0:11,908 --> 1:0:13,743
Okay, I'm licked.


973
1:0:13,743 --> 1:0:15,11
So what?


974
1:0:15,11 --> 1:0:17,413
You got lots to learn,
Mr. Hale, lots.


975
1:0:17,413 --> 1:0:18,715
I scratched
a bargain with you


976
1:0:18,715 --> 1:0:20,617
on a piece of paper,
and I kept it.


977
1:0:20,617 --> 1:0:23,252
But now, you're sticking your
nose in my personal affairs,


978
1:0:23,252 --> 1:0:25,455
so from now on
bargains don't count.


979
1:0:25,455 --> 1:0:42,71
And you won't be
long finding that out.


980
1:0:42,71 --> 1:0:48,344
Jack! Jack!


981
1:0:48,344 --> 1:0:50,546
Dave Tolliver!
He's coming to get you!


982
1:0:50,546 --> 1:0:53,449
There's going to
be a big fight.


983
1:0:53,449 --> 1:1:14,637
Is there?


984
1:1:14,637 --> 1:1:16,839
What are you doing here?


985
1:1:16,839 --> 1:1:18,207
I'm here 'cause
I ain't going back.


986
1:1:18,207 --> 1:1:19,509
I thought I told Dave
to take you...


987
1:1:19,509 --> 1:1:21,477
The sheriff said,
"I'm taking you


988
1:1:21,477 --> 1:1:23,78
"to the outskirts of town,
Dave Tolliver.


989
1:1:23,78 --> 1:1:25,481
"I'm leaving the rest
to your own judgment."


990
1:1:25,481 --> 1:1:26,716
Now see here, I'm not going to allow you...


991
1:1:26,716 --> 1:1:27,917
I ain't listening.


992
1:1:27,917 --> 1:1:30,687
You told me to get an education,
I'm getting an education.


993
1:1:30,687 --> 1:1:33,723
I'm staying here. If I can't stay
here, I'll stay where I can stay.


994
1:1:33,723 --> 1:1:35,758
You can't stop me,
nobody's gonna stop me!


995
1:1:35,758 --> 1:1:38,594
I'll show the whole kit and boodle
of you how much I can get learned.


996
1:1:38,594 --> 1:1:40,363
I'll be smarter than you!
That's what I'll be!


997
1:1:40,363 --> 1:1:42,265
Now listen, you little stick of dynamite.


998
1:1:42,265 --> 1:1:43,633
You're getting
out of here now.


999
1:1:43,633 --> 1:1:45,68
You're going back
up in the mountains.


1000
1:1:45,68 --> 1:1:46,703
I've heard enough of you
and I've seen enough of you.


1001
1:1:46,703 --> 1:1:50,873
For the present, at least.
Now, come on, get out.


1002
1:1:50,873 --> 1:1:54,43
You...


1003
1:1:54,43 --> 1:1:57,48
All right, I'll go


1004
1:1:57,48 --> 1:1:59,582
if you want me to go.


1005
1:1:59,582 --> 1:2:1,718
Sure.


1006
1:2:1,718 --> 1:2:5,688
I don't want people
not to want me.


1007
1:2:5,688 --> 1:2:7,724
Wait a minute.


1008
1:2:7,724 --> 1:2:9,726
How did you do that?


1009
1:2:9,726 --> 1:2:14,43
Oh, that.


1010
1:2:14,43 --> 1:2:18,468
You did it
when you pushed me down.


1011
1:2:18,468 --> 1:2:20,77
I'm sorry.


1012
1:2:20,77 --> 1:2:22,38
It might have been
a rusty nail or something.


1013
1:2:22,38 --> 1:2:30,646
We'd better fix it up.
Come over here.


1014
1:2:30,646 --> 1:2:32,949
So that's it, is it?


1015
1:2:32,949 --> 1:2:35,585
And I thought you were just
interested in the coal business.


1016
1:2:35,585 --> 1:2:36,753
She's hurt her hand.


1017
1:2:36,753 --> 1:2:40,123
You've killed your future,
around here, anyway.


1018
1:2:40,123 --> 1:2:42,558
You're not satisfied with
one enemy, you make two.


1019
1:2:42,558 --> 1:2:44,6
You realize
what you've done?


1020
1:2:44,6 --> 1:2:47,13
Now the Falins hate you, the
Tollivers will never forgive you.


1021
1:2:47,13 --> 1:2:49,31
The Tollivers, why?
That's why.


1022
1:2:49,31 --> 1:2:52,168
That girl's gonna go back
to the mountains, now.


1023
1:2:52,168 --> 1:2:54,737
She didn't come here to start
any trouble, it just happened.


1024
1:2:54,737 --> 1:2:57,573
She's got a mind of her own, and
if she wants to stay here she can.


1025
1:2:57,573 --> 1:2:58,975
In this town?
Lmpossible.


1026
1:2:58,975 --> 1:3:0,343
I'll take her
to Brighton.


1027
1:3:0,343 --> 1:3:2,245
Or Plenny or Sand Creek. It
doesn't matter where you take her


1028
1:3:2,245 --> 1:3:3,679
around here, you're about to meet Tollivers.


1029
1:3:3,679 --> 1:3:5,548
All right, I'll take her
to Louisville to my sister.


1030
1:3:5,548 --> 1:3:7,283
What do you think of that?
Nothing.


1031
1:3:7,283 --> 1:3:8,951
Except that
I'm flabbergasted.


1032
1:3:8,951 --> 1:3:10,386
Nonplussed.


1033
1:3:10,386 --> 1:3:11,654
And if you
don't mind me saying so,


1034
1:3:11,654 --> 1:3:15,825
I think you're just
a little bit nuts.


1035
1:3:15,825 --> 1:3:18,928
Thank you.


1036
1:3:18,928 --> 1:3:54,997
Both of you.


1037
1:3:54,997 --> 1:3:58,234
Mr. Hale! Oh, Mr. Hale!
You forgot the hat.


1038
1:3:58,234 --> 1:4:9,345
Thanks, Leo.


1039
1:4:9,345 --> 1:4:10,58
Well, here you are.


1040
1:4:10,58 --> 1:4:11,781
Do I...


1041
1:4:11,781 --> 1:4:14,183
Are you sure your sister will recognize me?


1042
1:4:14,183 --> 1:4:15,985
I don't see
how she can miss.


1043
1:4:15,985 --> 1:4:17,52
Do I look all right?


1044
1:4:17,52 --> 1:4:20,122
My dear young lady,
reticent as I am by nature,


1045
1:4:20,122 --> 1:4:21,691
it behooves me at this moment to tell you


1046
1:4:21,691 --> 1:4:23,626
that you're wearing the
finest the city affords.


1047
1:4:23,626 --> 1:4:25,862
All aboard!


1048
1:4:25,862 --> 1:4:32,368
Well, you better get on.


1049
1:4:32,368 --> 1:5:5,368
Ain't... Ain't you
gonna kiss me goodbye?


1050
1:5:5,368 --> 1:5:7,136
Well, that's over with.
Is it?


1051
1:5:7,136 --> 1:5:9,505
Yeah. What do
you mean, "Is it"?


1052
1:5:9,505 --> 1:5:11,7
No, I mean, I'm glad it's over with.


1053
1:5:11,7 --> 1:5:12,475
Are you?


1054
1:5:12,475 --> 1:5:14,143
She's nuts.
Is she?


1055
1:5:14,143 --> 1:5:15,778
Sure she is.
Any fool can see that.


1056
1:5:15,778 --> 1:5:17,88
Well, perhaps, that's
why I'm a little stupid.


1057
1:5:17,88 --> 1:5:19,248
Yeah, maybe that's...


1058
1:5:19,248 --> 1:5:20,917
Say, what is this
"isn't" and "is she"?


1059
1:5:20,917 --> 1:5:22,218
My dear fellow,
if you'll allow me,


1060
1:5:22,218 --> 1:5:24,654
let us take "isn't"
and "is she."


1061
1:5:24,654 --> 1:5:27,556
"Is" is that we both know,
I hope, is a verb.


1062
1:5:27,556 --> 1:5:30,326
"It" is a neuter gender,
and she is the feminine.


1063
1:5:30,326 --> 1:5:33,763
Thus, we have the neuter and
the feminine, but no masculine.


1064
1:5:33,763 --> 1:5:36,632
"What? No masculine,"
you say, then I say...


1065
1:5:36,632 --> 1:5:38,34
"I'm nuts,"
that's what you say.


1066
1:5:38,34 --> 1:5:39,702
Yeah, that's right,
you're nuts!


1067
1:5:39,702 --> 1:5:41,537
She's in love
with you, Jack.


1068
1:5:41,537 --> 1:5:43,506
In love? Who?
June.


1069
1:5:43,506 --> 1:5:44,74
Are you crazy?


1070
1:5:44,74 --> 1:5:45,841
No, no, that's already
been settled.


1071
1:5:45,841 --> 1:5:47,76
You're the one
who's crazy.


1072
1:5:47,76 --> 1:5:50,279
Why, she's been goo-gooing,
gee-geeing all over you


1073
1:5:50,279 --> 1:5:51,714
ever since
we started the camp.


1074
1:5:51,714 --> 1:5:53,549
Don't talk nonsense.


1075
1:5:53,549 --> 1:5:56,485
In love. Why, she only came
down to camp to bring Buddie.


1076
1:5:56,485 --> 1:5:58,12
In love with me.
You're an idiot.


1077
1:5:58,12 --> 1:5:59,855
I hope so.


1078
1:5:59,855 --> 1:6:8,931
I sincerely hope so.


1079
1:6:8,931 --> 1:7:9,558
The camp, Thurber.
It's on fire!


1080
1:7:9,558 --> 1:7:11,46
A bunch of fellows came over
the hill carrying torches.


1081
1:7:11,46 --> 1:7:12,795
The fellow leading
him was a-shooting.


1082
1:7:12,795 --> 1:7:14,63
The Falins.


1083
1:7:14,63 --> 1:7:16,32
Well... Never mind, we'll
talk about that later.


1084
1:7:16,32 --> 1:7:17,466
I'll get the stock
out of the corral.


1085
1:7:17,466 --> 1:8:20,996
You get the instruments
and maps out of there.


1086
1:8:20,996 --> 1:8:24,3
So that's how
you want it, is it?


1087
1:8:24,3 --> 1:8:27,603
All right, you skulking
coyotes, I'll play your game.


1088
1:8:27,603 --> 1:8:30,639
They're not gonna let me...


1089
1:8:30,639 --> 1:8:35,511
I'll put this road through if I have to
use your dirty rotten bodies for ties.


1090
1:8:35,511 --> 1:9:6,108
I'll do it if I have to hire every
man in Gaptown to finish the job.


1091
1:9:6,108 --> 1:9:7,409
If you
could have seen it


1092
1:9:7,409 --> 1:9:9,478
I know you would have split your sides a
- laughing.


1093
1:9:9,478 --> 1:9:13,315
I was sitting there mending, and I
hear the dripping and the sizzling,


1094
1:9:13,315 --> 1:9:15,885
and I says to myself,
I says, "I bet a rooster


1095
1:9:15,885 --> 1:9:17,887
"it's the soft soap
a- boiling over."


1096
1:9:17,887 --> 1:9:18,988
And sure enough...


1097
1:9:18,988 --> 1:9:21,757
Better try some of these
dandelion greens, son.


1098
1:9:21,757 --> 1:9:24,66
Zeke Denker fetched
them over this morning.


1099
1:9:24,66 --> 1:9:25,761
I ain't hungry.


1100
1:9:25,761 --> 1:9:27,363
But, David, you gotta eat something


1101
1:9:27,363 --> 1:9:29,698
after all the plowing
you've done.


1102
1:9:29,698 --> 1:9:31,634
Pappy.


1103
1:9:31,634 --> 1:9:35,37
A is the first letter
in the alphabet.


1104
1:9:35,37 --> 1:9:43,746
Because it means
"And" "Apple" and "Ax."


1105
1:9:43,746 --> 1:9:45,681
What's this one, Pappy?


1106
1:9:45,681 --> 1:9:49,752
You mean this one?


1107
1:9:49,752 --> 1:9:52,922
Offhand I'd say
it's alike an ox yoke.


1108
1:9:52,922 --> 1:9:55,391
Didn't Mr. Hale tell you?


1109
1:9:55,391 --> 1:9:57,293
He told me
but I forgot.


1110
1:9:57,293 --> 1:10:0,95
It ain't like
no Tolliver to forget.


1111
1:10:0,95 --> 1:10:4,33
Now, if I would
have been told...


1112
1:10:4,33 --> 1:10:7,703
You know what that is?


1113
1:10:7,703 --> 1:10:9,371
Yeah.


1114
1:10:9,371 --> 1:10:16,178
Civilization!


1115
1:10:16,178 --> 1:10:17,546
David, you oughtn't
to have done that!


1116
1:10:17,546 --> 1:10:18,881
I'm through pretending.


1117
1:10:18,881 --> 1:10:20,649
Like you've been doing
all of last month.


1118
1:10:20,649 --> 1:10:21,85
Saying things
you didn't mean.


1119
1:10:21,85 --> 1:10:23,18
I'm getting sick
of the whole thing.


1120
1:10:23,18 --> 1:10:26,121
Now, son, look, you gotta keep your shirt on.


1121
1:10:26,121 --> 1:10:29,825
If it's June you're worrying
about, she'll be back pretty short.


1122
1:10:29,825 --> 1:10:30,96
No, she ain't.


1123
1:10:30,96 --> 1:10:33,262
She ain't never coming back.
Not the June I know.


1124
1:10:33,262 --> 1:10:35,231
Ain't nothing gonna
be the way it was.


1125
1:10:35,231 --> 1:10:38,133
Look at Buddie,
even he's different.


1126
1:10:38,133 --> 1:10:39,935
So are you.
Me?


1127
1:10:39,935 --> 1:10:41,27
Yes, you are.


1128
1:10:41,27 --> 1:10:43,872
Them new fangled machines
down in Ticopi that's doing it.


1129
1:10:43,872 --> 1:10:45,341
Every day you traipse down there with Buddie


1130
1:10:45,341 --> 1:10:46,775
and you come back
being different.


1131
1:10:46,775 --> 1:10:48,477
Half the time
you're feeling glad.


1132
1:10:48,477 --> 1:10:50,879
Like last week, they
tore up one of our fields.


1133
1:10:50,879 --> 1:10:53,582
Them machines don't care who's
been plowing there for 50 years.


1134
1:10:53,582 --> 1:10:55,618
The Tollivers don't mean nothing to them.


1135
1:10:55,618 --> 1:10:57,453
I ain't nobody
with a high temper.


1136
1:10:57,453 --> 1:10:59,255
But you're talking
unreasonable.


1137
1:10:59,255 --> 1:11:0,756
We're getting rich,
ain't we?


1138
1:11:0,756 --> 1:11:3,125
Look at them five checks
over there in that bowl.


1139
1:11:3,125 --> 1:11:4,36
Half of them is yours.


1140
1:11:4,36 --> 1:11:7,296
And how did we get them?
Just doing nothing.


1141
1:11:7,296 --> 1:11:10,499
And if that's what you call
civilization, then I'm for it.


1142
1:11:10,499 --> 1:11:12,868
Judd!
He needs a-talking to.


1143
1:11:12,868 --> 1:11:15,4
It ain't right for no young
man to brood about nothing.


1144
1:11:15,4 --> 1:11:16,939
This you call
nothing, huh?


1145
1:11:16,939 --> 1:11:18,54
Listen, there's got to
be a change, you see?


1146
1:11:18,54 --> 1:11:19,875
Not for me,
there ain't.


1147
1:11:19,875 --> 1:11:21,76
There ain't no more
chance of me changing


1148
1:11:21,76 --> 1:11:23,412
than there is of that old Lonesome
Pine changed into a hickory.


1149
1:11:23,412 --> 1:11:25,581
I belong to the earth.
The plowed up soil.


1150
1:11:25,581 --> 1:11:27,516
I was raised and
I'm gonna die in it.


1151
1:11:27,516 --> 1:11:29,51
You got what you like?
You can have it.


1152
1:11:29,51 --> 1:11:34,69
Me, I'm going back. Back
where my pappy raised me.


1153
1:11:34,69 --> 1:11:36,625
David, you can't
do that.


1154
1:11:36,625 --> 1:11:39,595
You're our boy.
I mean, you're like our boy.


1155
1:11:39,595 --> 1:11:45,868
I ain't a-wanting
you to go.


1156
1:11:45,868 --> 1:11:49,238
Two pink-eyed doves
sitting in a tree,


1157
1:11:49,238 --> 1:11:51,74
one for you, one for me.


1158
1:11:51,74 --> 1:12:19,735
For June.


1159
1:12:19,735 --> 1:12:26,275
<i>For when</i>
<i>it's twilight on the trail</i>


1160
1:12:26,275 --> 1:12:30,346
<i>And I jog along</i>


1161
1:12:30,346 --> 1:12:34,95
<i>The world is like a dream</i>


1162
1:12:34,95 --> 1:12:39,655
<i>And the ripple</i>
<i>of the stream</i>


1163
1:12:39,655 --> 1:12:43,559
<i>Is my song</i>


1164
1:12:43,559 --> 1:13:5,981
<i>For when it's twilight</i>
<i>on the trail</i>


1165
1:13:5,981 --> 1:13:8,417
Hello?


1166
1:13:8,417 --> 1:13:12,221
Well, well, well,
Miss Tolliver.


1167
1:13:12,221 --> 1:13:13,389
What, again?


1168
1:13:13,389 --> 1:13:14,49
Obviously.


1169
1:13:14,49 --> 1:13:16,658
Do I tell her
you're out to tea?


1170
1:13:16,658 --> 1:13:21,964
No, I'll talk to her.


1171
1:13:21,964 --> 1:13:24,767
You'd better go out and check
with Marks about those uprights.


1172
1:13:24,767 --> 1:13:27,469
Naturally.


1173
1:13:27,469 --> 1:13:28,771
Hello, June.


1174
1:13:28,771 --> 1:13:31,273
Are you mad at somebody
or something?


1175
1:13:31,273 --> 1:13:34,61
Well, you talk like it.


1176
1:13:34,61 --> 1:13:37,112
Oh, yeah.


1177
1:13:37,112 --> 1:13:39,415
Busy? You don't know
what busy means.


1178
1:13:39,415 --> 1:13:40,749
I ain't...


1179
1:13:40,749 --> 1:13:44,52
I mean, I haven't
had a minute to myself.


1180
1:13:44,52 --> 1:13:46,755
This morning I learnt
all about the Revolution.


1181
1:13:46,755 --> 1:13:49,358
It was just like a feud.


1182
1:13:49,358 --> 1:13:52,294
In 1775...


1183
1:13:52,294 --> 1:13:54,563
Wait a minute, June.
Come in.


1184
1:13:54,563 --> 1:13:56,432
Mr. Hale, we've got that slue banked.


1185
1:13:56,432 --> 1:13:57,766
That's fine, Taylor.


1186
1:13:57,766 --> 1:14:0,2
Wait a minute, get the steam
shovel out on the bridge


1187
1:14:0,2 --> 1:14:1,603
so we can start to
fill in the morning.


1188
1:14:1,603 --> 1:14:3,105
Yes, sir.


1189
1:14:3,105 --> 1:14:5,541
Yeah, June?


1190
1:14:5,541 --> 1:14:7,142
Yeah.


1191
1:14:7,142 --> 1:14:10,779
But that wasn't Patrick Henry,
that was Lord Cornwallis.


1192
1:14:10,779 --> 1:14:12,8
Cornwallis.


1193
1:14:12,8 --> 1:14:13,649
All right. Cornwallis.


1194
1:14:13,649 --> 1:14:17,453
What difference
does it make?


1195
1:14:17,453 --> 1:14:20,589
How are you?


1196
1:14:20,589 --> 1:14:23,926
How's Pappy and Mammy
and Buddie?


1197
1:14:23,926 --> 1:14:25,6
They are?


1198
1:14:25,6 --> 1:14:33,702
Yeah.


1199
1:14:33,702 --> 1:14:37,739
Say, June, you know you've
got the prettiest eyes.


1200
1:14:37,739 --> 1:14:40,108
Yeah.


1201
1:14:40,108 --> 1:14:44,847
And the cutest nose.


1202
1:14:44,847 --> 1:14:56,558
Say, have you
got a dimple?


1203
1:14:56,558 --> 1:14:58,26
You get a fix, Son?


1204
1:14:58,26 --> 1:15:0,162
She's all sort onto the
bridge and ready to go.


1205
1:15:0,162 --> 1:15:1,864
We'll pop her off
in the morning.


1206
1:15:1,864 --> 1:15:28,59
Kind of like to have
Mr. Hale see it.


1207
1:15:28,59 --> 1:15:30,158
Hey, Pappy.


1208
1:15:30,158 --> 1:15:34,696
Now we're here
for Mr. Corsey?


1209
1:15:34,696 --> 1:15:36,698
Yeah, but you stay right here till your pappy


1210
1:15:36,698 --> 1:15:38,634
gets through talking
to Mr. Hale.


1211
1:15:38,634 --> 1:15:57,719
Thanks, Pappy.


1212
1:15:57,719 --> 1:16:0,88
Can I come in,
Mr. Hale?


1213
1:16:0,88 --> 1:16:4,326
Sure, come on in.


1214
1:16:4,326 --> 1:16:7,329
I got serious things to
talk to you about, Mr. Hale.


1215
1:16:7,329 --> 1:16:17,539
Sit down.


1216
1:16:17,539 --> 1:16:19,441
And now, it's Dave
that's going away.


1217
1:16:19,441 --> 1:16:20,943
It's gotten me worried.


1218
1:16:20,943 --> 1:16:22,678
About Melissa, I mean.


1219
1:16:22,678 --> 1:16:24,88
She don't sing
no more, Mr. Hale.


1220
1:16:24,88 --> 1:16:27,716
Sun up always seen her singing, you know?


1221
1:16:27,716 --> 1:16:30,285
I'm sorry about Melissa,
but there's nothing I can do.


1222
1:16:30,285 --> 1:16:31,853
I got troubles of my own.


1223
1:16:31,853 --> 1:16:33,822
You gotta come, Mr. Hale.


1224
1:16:33,822 --> 1:16:36,325
Melissa,
she'll listen to you.


1225
1:16:36,325 --> 1:16:38,594
Somehow, I don't talk
the right language to her.


1226
1:16:38,594 --> 1:16:40,996
No wonder you can't speak a
language which Melissa understands.


1227
1:16:40,996 --> 1:16:43,165
I've never heard her favor
your feud to the Falins.


1228
1:16:43,165 --> 1:16:45,4
Have you done anything to
stop it? No, you haven't.


1229
1:16:45,4 --> 1:16:46,635
You came down here
to blame me


1230
1:16:46,635 --> 1:16:48,403
for June's going away
and for Dave's leaving.


1231
1:16:48,403 --> 1:16:50,205
You'd like to
thrust the responsibility


1232
1:16:50,205 --> 1:16:51,94
for Melissa's suffering
on my shoulders.


1233
1:16:51,94 --> 1:17:5,454
Well, you don't do it. I've got enough
of you and your whole stupid outfit.


1234
1:17:5,454 --> 1:17:7,22
I'm sorry, Judd, I...


1235
1:17:7,22 --> 1:17:9,791
I didn't really mean
what I said.


1236
1:17:9,791 --> 1:17:11,66
Sure glad.


1237
1:17:11,66 --> 1:17:16,898
I liked you the first day
you walked into my house.


1238
1:17:16,898 --> 1:17:20,302
Wait a minute.


1239
1:17:20,302 --> 1:17:22,237
Hello?


1240
1:17:22,237 --> 1:17:24,439
Yes, Hale speaking.


1241
1:17:24,439 --> 1:17:27,275
Louisville?
Just a minute.


1242
1:17:27,275 --> 1:17:30,212
You wanna
speak to June?


1243
1:17:30,212 --> 1:17:31,313
Can I?


1244
1:17:31,313 --> 1:17:33,181
Come here.


1245
1:17:33,181 --> 1:17:39,521
<i>Hold that up to your ear.</i>


1246
1:17:39,521 --> 1:17:41,757
Now, talk right in here.


1247
1:17:41,757 --> 1:17:43,125
What for?


1248
1:17:43,125 --> 1:17:45,193
Well, you wanna speak
to June, don't you?


1249
1:17:45,193 --> 1:17:46,862
But you said
she was in Louisville.


1250
1:17:46,862 --> 1:17:52,801
Well, that's where
she is.


1251
1:17:52,801 --> 1:17:55,404
<i>Hello, Pappy.</i>


1252
1:17:55,404 --> 1:17:58,306
June.


1253
1:17:58,306 --> 1:17:59,841
Where are you hiding?


1254
1:17:59,841 --> 1:18:4,946
I'm not hiding, Pappy.
I'm in Louisville.


1255
1:18:4,946 --> 1:18:6,415
She says
she's in Louisville.


1256
1:18:6,415 --> 1:18:9,518
Well, that's what
I told you.


1257
1:18:9,518 --> 1:18:11,119
Is this thing hollow
all the way through?


1258
1:18:11,119 --> 1:18:12,621
Yeah, all the way through.


1259
1:18:12,621 --> 1:18:19,461
Well...


1260
1:18:19,461 --> 1:18:48,356
Hello, little brush rabbit.


1261
1:18:48,356 --> 1:18:53,261
You didn't, huh?


1262
1:18:53,261 --> 1:19:17,552
You know what your ma said
this morning?


1263
1:19:17,552 --> 1:19:23,358
Operator?


1264
1:19:23,358 --> 1:19:30,398
Buddie!
Buddie is in there.


1265
1:19:30,398 --> 1:19:32,601
Buddie.


1266
1:19:32,601 --> 1:19:34,369
Pappy.


1267
1:19:34,369 --> 1:19:36,37
Jack.


1268
1:19:36,37 --> 1:19:42,844
Pappy!


1269
1:19:42,844 --> 1:19:47,349
Buddie! Buddie!


1270
1:19:47,349 --> 1:19:55,457
Buddie!


1271
1:19:55,457 --> 1:19:59,928
<i></i>


1272
1:19:59,928 --> 1:20:2,43
Buddie. Buddie.


1273
1:20:2,43 --> 1:20:5,567
<i>Get me Dr. Owen, quick.</i>


1274
1:20:5,567 --> 1:20:12,908
Get me some hot water.


1275
1:20:12,908 --> 1:20:16,978
Buddie.


1276
1:20:16,978 --> 1:20:20,682
Son. It's your pappy, Son.


1277
1:20:20,682 --> 1:20:23,451
Oh, God,
don't let him die.


1278
1:20:23,451 --> 1:20:28,69
Don't take him away
from my poor Melissa.


1279
1:20:28,69 --> 1:20:32,527
Buddie.


1280
1:20:32,527 --> 1:21:20,609
<i>Buddie.</i>


1281
1:21:20,609 --> 1:21:22,811
You may be the civil law
around here, but get this,


1282
1:21:22,811 --> 1:21:25,146
interference with the public
carriers, the railroad, I mean,


1283
1:21:25,146 --> 1:21:26,681
that's a federal offense.


1284
1:21:26,681 --> 1:21:28,183
It might have been
an accident.


1285
1:21:28,183 --> 1:21:30,185
But it wasn't!


1286
1:21:30,185 --> 1:21:31,553
It was cold wanton murder!


1287
1:21:31,553 --> 1:21:34,522
They killed little Buddie!
They murdered him! A baby!


1288
1:21:34,522 --> 1:21:36,358
And I'm gonna put them
where they rot.


1289
1:21:36,358 --> 1:21:38,627
Not for a murder, your
heels are too smart for that.


1290
1:21:38,627 --> 1:21:41,263
And there's not a man in this town
with courage enough to convict him.


1291
1:21:41,263 --> 1:21:43,531
But you're gonna make out
a warrant on my charges!


1292
1:21:43,531 --> 1:21:44,933
You're gonna do what I say.


1293
1:21:44,933 --> 1:21:46,935
And you're gonna do
everything I say.


1294
1:21:46,935 --> 1:21:51,206
Mr. Hale, I've lived in this
country for more than 50 years.


1295
1:21:51,206 --> 1:21:54,409
I was born here,
and I know these people.


1296
1:21:54,409 --> 1:21:57,812
I can bring the Falins
to court. Maybe hang them.


1297
1:21:57,812 --> 1:22:1,16
But that don't stop feuds.
It makes them.


1298
1:22:1,16 --> 1:22:4,219
There'd be killings like
we've never seen before.


1299
1:22:4,219 --> 1:22:7,122
Mountain people don't
seem to like law, Mr. Hale.


1300
1:22:7,122 --> 1:22:10,959
Down here, peace has got to come from within.


1301
1:22:10,959 --> 1:22:13,461
It all seems kind of brutal and
primitive while it's a-boiling,


1302
1:22:13,461 --> 1:22:17,599
but, well, I was born here and I know.


1303
1:22:17,599 --> 1:22:20,435
I'm talking honest,
Mr. Hale.


1304
1:22:20,435 --> 1:22:22,137
You know, I...


1305
1:22:22,137 --> 1:22:25,307
I cried when they told me
Buddie was killed.


1306
1:22:25,307 --> 1:22:27,8
Why, I used to ride miles
out of my way


1307
1:22:27,8 --> 1:22:29,21
to fetch him
some stick candy.


1308
1:22:29,21 --> 1:22:31,813
But I like Jim Falin, too.


1309
1:22:31,813 --> 1:22:34,82
That was before
you come here.


1310
1:22:34,82 --> 1:22:37,452
He's older than Buddie
but just a kid.


1311
1:22:37,452 --> 1:22:39,621
Eyes always a-laughing.


1312
1:22:39,621 --> 1:22:42,624
He was
Buck's favorite son.


1313
1:22:42,624 --> 1:22:44,859
Dave Tolliver shot him.


1314
1:22:44,859 --> 1:22:47,28
Had reasons, I guess.


1315
1:22:47,28 --> 1:22:48,697
Or I could have
cramped him in jail.


1316
1:22:48,697 --> 1:22:50,498
Yes, I could.


1317
1:22:50,498 --> 1:22:54,636
But did you ever get up close to
Melissa and look into her eyes?


1318
1:22:54,636 --> 1:22:55,837
Well, you do that
sometime.


1319
1:22:55,837 --> 1:22:57,806
Then you tell me
what kind of a law


1320
1:22:57,806 --> 1:23:1,9
you can think of
that will correct it.


1321
1:23:1,9 --> 1:23:11,987
Tell me...
June!


1322
1:23:11,987 --> 1:23:15,623
He couldn't just die,
could he?


1323
1:23:15,623 --> 1:23:18,126
He had to be killed.


1324
1:23:18,126 --> 1:23:20,28
Killed by the Falin.


1325
1:23:20,28 --> 1:23:22,263
They did that.


1326
1:23:22,263 --> 1:23:24,165
He was my only brother.


1327
1:23:24,165 --> 1:23:26,968
And they killed him.


1328
1:23:26,968 --> 1:23:30,538
He ran down the hill with
me before I went away.


1329
1:23:30,538 --> 1:23:33,942
He stood up there
at the Lonesome Pine.


1330
1:23:33,942 --> 1:23:37,479
I never got to
see him again.


1331
1:23:37,479 --> 1:23:41,75
I'm never going to
see him again.


1332
1:23:41,75 --> 1:23:43,351
What are you doing here?


1333
1:23:43,351 --> 1:23:46,521
Why aren't you up there
with Dave and Daddy?


1334
1:23:46,521 --> 1:23:48,423
You loved Buddie,
didn't you?


1335
1:23:48,423 --> 1:23:51,659
You said you loved him.


1336
1:23:51,659 --> 1:23:53,528
He was gonna be an engineer.


1337
1:23:53,528 --> 1:23:57,432
Like you and Corsey.


1338
1:23:57,432 --> 1:24:1,569
When I tucked him in
at night, he said,


1339
1:24:1,569 --> 1:24:7,842
"A is for apple, and I'll bet
you I'll be as big as Mr. Hale."


1340
1:24:7,842 --> 1:24:9,144
What are you doing here?


1341
1:24:9,144 --> 1:24:11,112
June.


1342
1:24:11,112 --> 1:24:13,14
You're down here
with the law!


1343
1:24:13,14 --> 1:24:14,949
The law's gonna help you!


1344
1:24:14,949 --> 1:24:17,519
The laws gonna show you
how it don't hurt.


1345
1:24:17,519 --> 1:24:19,587
When somebody you love...


1346
1:24:19,587 --> 1:24:20,722
When somebody you love...


1347
1:24:20,722 --> 1:24:21,79
Oh, June, darling,
don't cry.


1348
1:24:21,79 --> 1:24:24,559
You mustn't cry.
Listen to me, dear.


1349
1:24:24,559 --> 1:24:28,763
I love you, and...


1350
1:24:28,763 --> 1:24:31,132
You love me?


1351
1:24:31,132 --> 1:24:33,868
You said
you loved Buddie.


1352
1:24:33,868 --> 1:24:35,937
Why aren't you
with Buddie?


1353
1:24:35,937 --> 1:24:38,339
Why aren't you
where they need you?


1354
1:24:38,339 --> 1:24:40,308
You're here
with the law.


1355
1:24:40,308 --> 1:24:41,509
You don't love me!


1356
1:24:41,509 --> 1:24:43,578
Well, I do
with all of my heart.


1357
1:24:43,578 --> 1:24:48,516
You never said you love me before
and I was hungry to hear it.


1358
1:24:48,516 --> 1:24:50,452
You said
you love Buddie.


1359
1:24:50,452 --> 1:24:52,72
But you ain't
doing nothing about it!


1360
1:24:52,72 --> 1:24:55,423
You ain't fighting!
You ain't killing!


1361
1:24:55,423 --> 1:25:1,396
That's what's coming to them! The Falins!


1362
1:25:1,396 --> 1:25:3,398
This is what you wanted me to be, ain't it?


1363
1:25:3,398 --> 1:25:6,167
Pretty, nice words,
hollow words!


1364
1:25:6,167 --> 1:25:7,735
I don't want it!


1365
1:25:7,735 --> 1:25:10,138
I don't want you!
I don't want anything!


1366
1:25:10,138 --> 1:25:39,801
I don't want anything
but the Falins!


1367
1:25:39,801 --> 1:25:43,671
Our Father who art in
Heaven, hallowed be thy name.


1368
1:25:43,671 --> 1:25:46,975
Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth


1369
1:25:46,975 --> 1:25:48,743
as it is in Heaven.


1370
1:25:48,743 --> 1:25:52,48
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses


1371
1:25:52,48 --> 1:25:56,251
as we forgive those who trespass against us.


1372
1:25:56,251 --> 1:26:1,256
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.


1373
1:26:1,256 --> 1:26:6,261
For thine is the power and
the glory forever and ever.


1374
1:26:6,261 --> 1:26:18,473
Amen.


1375
1:26:18,473 --> 1:26:26,648
<i>When it's twilight</i>
<i>on the trail</i>


1376
1:26:26,648 --> 1:26:32,72
<i>And I rest once more</i>


1377
1:26:32,72 --> 1:26:37,458
<i>My ceiling is the sky</i>


1378
1:26:37,458 --> 1:26:40,495
<i>And the grass</i>


1379
1:26:40,495 --> 1:26:43,531
<i>On which I lie</i>


1380
1:26:43,531 --> 1:26:49,404
<i>Is my floor</i>


1381
1:26:49,404 --> 1:26:58,613
<i>When it's twilight</i>
<i>on the trail</i>


1382
1:26:58,613 --> 1:27:5,82
<i>And my voice is still</i>


1383
1:27:5,82 --> 1:27:9,39
<i>Please plant</i>
<i>this heart of mine</i>


1384
1:27:9,39 --> 1:27:16,598
<i>Underneath the Lonesome Pine</i>


1385
1:27:16,598 --> 1:27:28,76
<i>On the hill</i>


1386
1:27:28,76 --> 1:27:33,248
Oh, God, our Heavenly Father, we
bow before thee in meekest humbleness


1387
1:27:33,248 --> 1:27:38,786
leaving in thy divine wisdom and
accepting with equal humbleness


1388
1:27:38,786 --> 1:27:41,956
the complexities
of this life.


1389
1:27:41,956 --> 1:27:47,128
We are returning to the earth
that which thou has produced.


1390
1:27:47,128 --> 1:28:37,612
A part of thy soul,
of life eternal.


1391
1:28:37,612 --> 1:28:40,882
There's just about
eight of them, Judd.


1392
1:28:40,882 --> 1:28:42,383
Dominickers!


1393
1:28:42,383 --> 1:28:45,219
Looks like things is just
born to the Tollivers.


1394
1:28:45,219 --> 1:28:47,422
Don't it, Melissa?


1395
1:28:47,422 --> 1:28:50,258
Sure seems.


1396
1:28:50,258 --> 1:28:51,693
What are we
going to do?


1397
1:28:51,693 --> 1:28:53,194
What are we
standing here for?


1398
1:28:53,194 --> 1:28:54,662
June, honey.


1399
1:28:54,662 --> 1:28:56,998
I'm not just gonna
stand around any longer.


1400
1:28:56,998 --> 1:29:7,75
Be sensible.


1401
1:29:7,75 --> 1:29:8,943
Before green-up
time, Dave.


1402
1:29:8,943 --> 1:29:15,45
That's what you want,
isn't it?


1403
1:29:15,45 --> 1:29:16,684
You mean it?


1404
1:29:16,684 --> 1:29:20,88
It's gotta be somebody
who acts like a Tolliver.


1405
1:29:20,88 --> 1:29:33,968
Is that what
it's going to be?


1406
1:29:33,968 --> 1:29:35,903
Dave, I don't
want you to go.


1407
1:29:35,903 --> 1:29:38,706
I ain't hating the Falins.
I ain't hating nobody.


1408
1:29:38,706 --> 1:29:40,441
I ain't grieving
for Buddie.


1409
1:29:40,441 --> 1:29:42,477
June's my sorrow now.


1410
1:29:42,477 --> 1:29:44,912
I don't want to
go on hating.


1411
1:29:44,912 --> 1:29:48,182
Don't go, David.


1412
1:29:48,182 --> 1:29:50,952
Dave...
Wait a minute.


1413
1:29:50,952 --> 1:29:52,887
Dave, you're not going to
let him... Dave, listen.


1414
1:29:52,887 --> 1:29:56,157
You can't do this thing. You've
got green-up time to think about.


1415
1:29:56,157 --> 1:29:58,92
You'll be
getting married, then.


1416
1:29:58,92 --> 1:30:0,495
Now you're going out and
run the risk of being killed.


1417
1:30:0,495 --> 1:30:2,163
Hasn't there been enough
unhappiness in this house?


1418
1:30:2,163 --> 1:30:3,264
You ain't a Tolliver.


1419
1:30:3,264 --> 1:30:4,332
You're an outsider.


1420
1:30:4,332 --> 1:30:5,9
Yes. Well, none of you could have


1421
1:30:5,9 --> 1:30:7,902
loved little Buddie
any better than I did.


1422
1:30:7,902 --> 1:30:10,872
And he was killed because I taught
him to love the things I did.


1423
1:30:10,872 --> 1:30:12,507
It was my fault.


1424
1:30:12,507 --> 1:30:15,376
And this matter of getting
even is gonna be my business.


1425
1:30:15,376 --> 1:30:17,612
It's gonna be my business until
I've cleaned out every Falin


1426
1:30:17,612 --> 1:30:23,918
that had anything
to do with it.


1427
1:30:23,918 --> 1:30:39,367
Jack! Jack!


1428
1:30:39,367 --> 1:30:41,202
Dave.


1429
1:30:41,202 --> 1:30:42,77
I didn't want him to go.


1430
1:30:42,77 --> 1:30:45,173
I wouldn't have
let you go, either.


1431
1:30:45,173 --> 1:30:48,91
I would have
stopped you.


1432
1:30:48,91 --> 1:30:53,781
I only said those things
'cause I was hurt inside.


1433
1:30:53,781 --> 1:30:55,616
I could've stopped you.


1434
1:30:55,616 --> 1:30:57,418
But he's different.


1435
1:30:57,418 --> 1:31:0,655
He's not like a brother.


1436
1:31:0,655 --> 1:31:3,524
He'll never come back.


1437
1:31:3,524 --> 1:31:7,862
He'll never
wanna come back.


1438
1:31:7,862 --> 1:31:10,331
Dave.


1439
1:31:10,331 --> 1:31:11,933
Stop him.


1440
1:31:11,933 --> 1:31:15,837
Tell him what I can't.


1441
1:31:15,837 --> 1:31:39,126
Please, Dave.


1442
1:31:39,126 --> 1:31:40,495
You ain't going
to no Falins.


1443
1:31:40,495 --> 1:31:42,763
No? Well,
you try and stop me.


1444
1:31:42,763 --> 1:32:19,267
You're looking for trouble, Mr.
Hale, the mountains is full of it.


1445
1:32:19,267 --> 1:32:21,369
We're all brave men.


1446
1:32:21,369 --> 1:32:24,5
Falins are brave men.


1447
1:32:24,5 --> 1:32:25,206
You killed
the children.


1448
1:32:25,206 --> 1:32:27,8
I didn't know.


1449
1:32:27,8 --> 1:32:29,43
It's done now.


1450
1:32:29,43 --> 1:32:31,946
Sometime,
I'll wanna go downtown.


1451
1:32:31,946 --> 1:32:34,649
People, they'll look at me.


1452
1:32:34,649 --> 1:32:39,62
Maybe when I ain't around,
they'll call me Herod.


1453
1:32:39,62 --> 1:32:42,123
Herod Falin.


1454
1:32:42,123 --> 1:32:44,592
They might call me that.


1455
1:32:44,592 --> 1:32:46,761
He was a fellow
that done that once.


1456
1:32:46,761 --> 1:32:48,129
He killed babies.


1457
1:32:48,129 --> 1:32:49,997
The kid was a Tolliver,
wasn't he?


1458
1:32:49,997 --> 1:32:51,866
You're kind of forgetting
about Jim, ain't you?


1459
1:32:51,866 --> 1:32:53,601
I ain't
forgetting nothing.


1460
1:32:53,601 --> 1:32:56,704
Jim told me, in my arms, he
was hiding behind the bushes


1461
1:32:56,704 --> 1:32:58,573
trying to pick off
Dave Tolliver,


1462
1:32:58,573 --> 1:33:1,275
and Dave couldn't see
who he was shooting at.


1463
1:33:1,275 --> 1:33:4,912
Buddie Tolliver
couldn't say that.


1464
1:33:4,912 --> 1:33:7,248
I don't like him and
I ain't gonna like him.


1465
1:33:7,248 --> 1:33:13,854
I get my hands
on that Dave Tolliver...


1466
1:33:13,854 --> 1:33:15,156
Who's that?


1467
1:33:15,156 --> 1:33:24,398
Dave Tolliver.


1468
1:33:24,398 --> 1:33:26,33
What are you here for?


1469
1:33:26,33 --> 1:33:27,535
I wanna talk to you.


1470
1:33:27,535 --> 1:33:41,315
And I ain't carry no gun.


1471
1:33:41,315 --> 1:33:51,726
Come on in.


1472
1:33:51,726 --> 1:33:56,3
If I tell you... If I tell you
we're licked, will you stop fighting?


1473
1:33:56,3 --> 1:33:57,598
Who's licked?


1474
1:33:57,598 --> 1:34:0,701
Who do you mean?
Me.


1475
1:34:0,701 --> 1:34:3,7
You ain't licked.


1476
1:34:3,7 --> 1:34:6,173
You couldn't be licked.


1477
1:34:6,173 --> 1:34:8,209
Why did you come here?


1478
1:34:8,209 --> 1:34:10,544
Why?
Yeah.


1479
1:34:10,544 --> 1:34:12,847
Why shouldn't
I come to you?


1480
1:34:12,847 --> 1:34:15,16
I ought to have dragged myself
through all the brambles,


1481
1:34:15,16 --> 1:34:16,484
all the way from here
up to your house,


1482
1:34:16,484 --> 1:34:21,789
and say, "I'm sorry."


1483
1:34:21,789 --> 1:34:25,593
But I just ain't
got the sand.


1484
1:34:25,593 --> 1:34:27,595
You ain't my father.


1485
1:34:27,595 --> 1:34:29,497
You're a sniveling pup!


1486
1:34:29,497 --> 1:34:33,668
I've been like that.


1487
1:34:33,668 --> 1:34:36,837
Maybe that's what's
the trouble.


1488
1:34:36,837 --> 1:34:43,144
You wanna shake hands?


1489
1:34:43,144 --> 1:34:52,853
Now, tell me,
why did you do it?


1490
1:34:52,853 --> 1:35:28,589
It was Aunt Melissa's
birthday...


1491
1:35:28,589 --> 1:35:40,634
For a minute
I thought you meant it.


1492
1:35:40,634 --> 1:36:20,574
I did. I did!


1493
1:36:20,574 --> 1:36:24,979
Dave, what happened?


1494
1:36:24,979 --> 1:36:29,283
I fell on my gun.


1495
1:36:29,283 --> 1:36:31,352
Buck Falin was passing.


1496
1:36:31,352 --> 1:36:48,669
He was good enough
to fetch me home.


1497
1:36:48,669 --> 1:36:53,307
Dave.


1498
1:36:53,307 --> 1:36:56,777
If you don't mind,
can I...


1499
1:36:56,777 --> 1:36:59,98
Can I stay till...


1500
1:36:59,98 --> 1:37:9,49
Sure.


1501
1:37:9,49 --> 1:37:12,59
It's of no use, Jack.


1502
1:37:12,59 --> 1:37:15,863
You can't
cut this enough.


1503
1:37:15,863 --> 1:37:18,65
Dave.


1504
1:37:18,65 --> 1:37:19,7
Dave?


1505
1:37:19,7 --> 1:37:21,468
It'll soon be green-up.


1506
1:37:21,468 --> 1:37:23,671
And you'll have the biggest
wedding in the whole country.


1507
1:37:23,671 --> 1:37:31,979
Won't he, June?


1508
1:37:31,979 --> 1:37:46,727
In the spring, David.


1509
1:37:46,727 --> 1:37:51,98
One for you,


1510
1:37:51,98 --> 1:37:54,702
one for me.


1511
1:37:54,702 --> 1:38:12,19
Biggest wedding in...


1512
1:38:12,19 --> 1:38:18,926
<i>When it's twilight</i>
<i>on the trail</i>


1513
1:38:18,926 --> 1:38:23,364
<i>And my voice is still</i>


1514
1:38:23,364 --> 1:38:27,368
<i>Please plant</i>
<i>this heart of mine</i>


1515
1:38:27,368 --> 1:38:31,872
<i>Underneath that Lonesome Pine</i>


1516
1:38:31,872 --> 1:38:36,364
<i>On the hill</i>
