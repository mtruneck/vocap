3
0:0:21,29 --> 0:0:21,775
Hey, what's up?


4
0:0:21,775 --> 0:0:24,88
My name is A-Trak and I'm going
to tell you the story of


5
0:0:24,88 --> 0:0:27,98
one of the wildest
nights I've had.


6
0:0:27,98 --> 0:0:30,67
Going back to the early years
of my DJing, because I had a


7
0:0:30,67 --> 0:0:33,18
bit of a crew, we all
got booked in


8
0:0:33,18 --> 0:0:35,1
Houston Halloween weekend.


9
0:0:35,1 --> 0:0:37,14
I went there with my
friend, DJ Craze.


10
0:0:37,14 --> 0:0:40,266
We walked off the plane and
this girl picked us up--


11
0:0:40,266 --> 0:0:41,8
she was hot.


12
0:0:41,8 --> 0:0:43,36
She takes us to the hotel,
and as I mentioned,


13
0:0:43,36 --> 0:0:44,32
it's Halloween weekend.


14
0:0:44,32 --> 0:0:46,27
So she's like, can I change in
one of you guys' bathrooms?


15
0:0:46,27 --> 0:0:47,57
We're like, oh yeah, sure.


16
0:0:47,57 --> 0:0:50,65
So she goes into the bathroom
and comes out in full-leather


17
0:0:50,65 --> 0:0:51,99
cat woman suit--


18
0:0:51,99 --> 0:0:53,37
I'm like, whoa.


19
0:0:53,37 --> 0:0:54,42
I'm getting a call
from my agent.


20
0:0:54,42 --> 0:0:56,65
He's like, your promoter's
missing.


21
0:0:56,65 --> 0:0:58,38
We start hanging out in the
lobby because we're just


22
0:0:58,38 --> 0:1:0,42
waiting for a call to
know where to go.


23
0:1:0,42 --> 0:1:2,93
And in the lobby there was some
sort of formal party,


24
0:1:2,93 --> 0:1:6,9
people were wearing suits and
stuff and there was a piano.


25
0:1:6,9 --> 0:1:8,19
And lo and behold, [INAUDIBLE]


26
0:1:8,19 --> 0:1:10,57
in Humpty-Hump attire
walks up and starts


27
0:1:10,57 --> 0:1:11,44
playing on the piano.


28
0:1:11,44 --> 0:1:14,66
And these girls are getting
completely drunk right next to


29
0:1:14,66 --> 0:1:16,89
them, so very strange
juxtaposition.


30
0:1:16,89 --> 0:1:19,26
So my agent's like, all
right, I think I know


31
0:1:19,26 --> 0:1:20,42
what the venue is.


32
0:1:20,42 --> 0:1:23,23
I don't care if you guys play or
not, but I need you to pick


33
0:1:23,23 --> 0:1:23,655
up the money.


34
0:1:23,655 --> 0:1:25,52
So we break up into two cars.


35
0:1:25,52 --> 0:1:27,58
Me and Craze are in the
car with the one


36
0:1:27,58 --> 0:1:28,18
chick in the catsuit.


37
0:1:28,18 --> 0:1:31,71
So you see someone with fur
boots and someone in neon


38
0:1:31,71 --> 0:1:34,28
attire and a visor hat and
you're like, they know.


39
0:1:34,28 --> 0:1:36,25
So we're rolling down the window
being like yo, guys,


40
0:1:36,25 --> 0:1:36,75
where's the party?


41
0:1:36,75 --> 0:1:37,61
And they're like, what?


42
0:1:37,61 --> 0:1:39,9
They don't get that
we're the DJs.


43
0:1:39,9 --> 0:1:41,22
Like they're trying to not
tell us or something.


44
0:1:41,22 --> 0:1:42,91
We went to one spot, there's
nothing there.


45
0:1:42,91 --> 0:1:46,15
We go to another spot and we
walk into the place, there's a


46
0:1:46,15 --> 0:1:48,96
rave going on, there's
a party going on.


47
0:1:48,96 --> 0:1:52,68
I did my DJ set and as soon as
I walked offstage, chaos


48
0:1:52,68 --> 0:1:54,72
ensures and the word
gets around the


49
0:1:54,72 --> 0:1:55,51
Fire Marshall's here.


50
0:1:55,51 --> 0:1:58,6
People are running in every
direction and the party's


51
0:1:58,6 --> 0:1:58,45
getting shut down.


52
0:1:58,45 --> 0:2:1,4
And we're looking for the
promoter, and everyone we ask


53
0:2:1,4 --> 0:2:3,42
is sort of like ha, everyone's
looking for him.


54
0:2:3,42 --> 0:2:6,97
His buddy comes and finds me,
and he's like, yeah, Scott,


55
0:2:6,97 --> 0:2:8,61
had to uh-- go take
care of something.


56
0:2:8,61 --> 0:2:11,1
I see the promoter dude actually
jump out the window.


57
0:2:11,1 --> 0:2:14,94
Not as a suicide, just to run
away-- we're like ah, ah.


58
0:2:14,94 --> 0:2:17,47
My friend, DJ Craze, comes
in and finds me.


59
0:2:17,47 --> 0:2:19,77
Like glorious smile, super
excited, he's like "I got it."


60
0:2:19,77 --> 0:2:22,57
He managed to hide the little
tin container of


61
0:2:22,57 --> 0:2:23,67
cash from the cops.


62
0:2:23,67 --> 0:2:26,6
And the homegirl in the catsuit
was like you guys want


63
0:2:26,6 --> 0:2:26,9
to go to another party?


64
0:2:26,9 --> 0:2:29,0
And I'm just like, you guys
got to get me to my hotel.


65
0:2:29,0 --> 0:2:32,71
Now the hotel at least had
a hot tub in the room.


66
0:2:32,71 --> 0:2:33,65
And I'm going to kick back.


67
0:2:33,65 --> 0:2:35,66
Fuck everything, I'm getting
in the hot tub.


68
0:2:35,66 --> 0:2:38,18
And someone's knocking on
my door, and I'm sort


69
0:2:38,18 --> 0:2:39,27
of like who is it?


70
0:2:39,27 --> 0:2:42,11
I just throw on a robe
and open the door and


71
0:2:42,11 --> 0:2:43,2
be like what's up?


72
0:2:43,2 --> 0:2:45,77
And the homegirl in the catsuit
was like dressed in


73
0:2:45,77 --> 0:2:47,342
borderline S&M gear.


74
0:2:47,342 --> 0:2:49,2
I was like, oh man.


75
0:2:49,2 --> 0:2:50,85
I think she had a whip
or something.


76
0:2:50,85 --> 0:2:52,75
And that was one of the weirdest
nights I've ever had


77
0:2:52,75 --> 0:2:54,45
on the road.


78
0:2:54,45 --> 0:4:54,45
