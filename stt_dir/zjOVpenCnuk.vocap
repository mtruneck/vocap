###73 This past week the preliminary analysis of the Gorilla DNA sequence was published
###79 in Nature magazine, with loads of headlines making bold assertions about
###83 how identical Gorillas, Chimps and humans are.  Well of course we're similar,
###89 but so what? Even if we were genetically identical, I have yet to see apes building
###94 spaceships and flying to the moon, or producing works of art or music, or
###98 performing stand up comedy.  Obviously the differences run far beyond the
###103 genetic.  But - when one actually examines the genetic data itself, you quickly find
###109 out that humans and apes aren't quite as similar as they're made out to be, and the
###114 "similarities" actually contradict evolutionary theory.  Chimpanzees are
###120 supposed to be our closest relative, and therefore most identical to us genetically.
###125 A 2005 Nature article pinpointed the genetic differences between humans and
###130 chimpanzees at about 4% different. Yet this most recent study said the chimp was
###135 only 1.37% different, and Gorilla was only 1.75 percent different than humans, and
###141 the orangutan is 3.4% different than humans.
###145 Now hold on a minute here, these are numbers that were published in a peer
###149 reviewed journal!  So is the chimp 4% different or 1.37% different?  But wait - it
###156 gets weirder - according the Ensemble website where you can download, analyze
###161 and compare all of these genomes yourself, we find that the chimpanzee
###164 genome is 3.35 BILLion letters long while the human genome is a mere 3.1 billion
###172 letters long - wait - that's an 8% difference in the number of letters alone. So to turn
###180 around and say that chimps and humans, which are at least 8% different, are in fact
###185 only 1.37% different shows that either a) they're not telling you everything or b)
###193 these scientists flunked high school math!
###197 Now I happen to know it's because of what they are NOT telling you. Well if they
###202 want to play THAT game, hey I can play that game too!  Let's use THEIR numbers
###207 (which aren't actually numbers at all, but rather propaganda portrayed as data)
###213 You'll note that if we take into account the differences in base pair numbers, or
###218 number of letters in the DNA, in the genomes of the different critters, and
###222 then we add that percentage difference together with the acknowledged
###225 differences from the latest Nature article, you quickly see that we are more
###230 genetically similar to Gorillas and Organgutans than we are to chimps!
###236 Now these numbers are complete fiction - they do not portray reality whatsoever,
###242 but neither do the figures presented in the Nature article.  My numbers are JUST
###247 as valid as the alleged values of similarity given in the nature article.  Why? Because
###252 of they are not telling you. You see, when they make these comparisons, the
###258 scientists are ignoring HUGE portions of the DNA, and homing in on selected
###264 genes that both the apes and humans have, and comparing just those genes!
###271 Ignoring the fact that these similar genes are often in radically different locations in
###276 the different organisms, we would of course expect they genes to be similar -
###279 they had a common designer!  You'll notice that once a car manufacturer
###284 builds a transmission, they'll use that transmission in different vehicles - that's
###289 good engineering, that's smart engineering.  The bracket mounts and
###292 such may be different in different vehicles, but the transmissions are
###296 essentially the same. That's evidence of a common designer, not evolution.
###301 So just what are the scientists IGNORING to arrive at this 98.63% identical claim for
###308 chimpanzees? Well they're ignoring ORFAN genes - genes which are exclusive
###314 to that organism, and not found in any others. In other words, if we were to
###318 compare the HUNDREDS of orfan genes between the apes and humans, we would
###322 find a ZERO percent match between chimps and humans!
###327 But wait - It gets better!  With last year's publication of the Orangutan genome in
###332 Nature magazine, the researchers noted that, depending on which genes you
###336 compared, the Orangutan was more closely related to humans than
###340 Chimpanzees were!
###343 This week's report on the Gorilla genome showed that the Gorillas were as much as
###347 30% dissimilar to humans, and in fact if we went on the falacious assumptions the
###352 researchers are using, the gorilla was more identical to humans and
###356 chimpanzees, than the humans and chimpanzees were to each other.  In other
###361 words, one could interpret the genetic data to mean that the gorilla was the
###365 intermediate organism between chimpanzees and humans!
###369 At the end of the day, none of this genetic information supports the idea of descent
###373 from a common ancestor - because there is nothing common about the information,
###378 and in fact can be interpreted in a miriad of evolutionary scenarios, the majority of
###384 which disagree with the alleged fossil evidence for human evolution!  However, it
###390 all fits in quite nicely with the fact that each organism was specially and uniquely
###395 created, with the Creator using some common design among the organisms.
###399 In fact, as Ebersberger et al. explained in their   2007 "Mapping Human Genetic
###404 Ancestry" paper in Molecular Biology and Evolution:
###438 Translation: The genetic evidence does not support common descent, but
###443 resembles a patchwork of genes among the organisms...... which could best be
###448 explained by a common designer, and I would suggest that common designer was
###453 the one the Apostle John spoke of in John 1:3 "All things were made by Him
###458 and without Him was not anything made that was made."  John was speaking of
###462 Jesus Christ, who created a human form to live in and sacrifice for your sins and
###466 mine, and rising from the dead so you could have confidence that He really was
###471 the way to eternal life.
###475 You'll notice a consistent reporting in these weekly shows - it seems every week
###479 another fossil is unearthed which shows exactly what we would expect to see,
###483 were the book of Genesis true: Stasis in the fossil record.  This week, we have a
###488 report in Public Library of Science one on a wonderful find of fossil sea cows -
###493 manatees.  Fossils taken from Florida, India and Mexico all reveal that from 28
###499 million years ago through to 3 million years ago, we see the evolutionary
###502 sequence of manatees evolving over millions of years....into manatees.
###510 Brian Thomas from Institute for Creation Research also pointed out a recent
###514 Chinese Science Bulletin describing fossil salamanders so well preserved that even
###519 their stomach contents were visible.
###521 Allegedly 150 million years old, the Chinese researchers remarked how these
###525 fossil salamanders look just like the giant Chinese salamander.  So 150 million years
###532 has caused the salamander to evolve into...the salamander.
###537 This is what we typically see in the fossil record - very little change, stasis.  In stark
###541 contrast to what would expect to find if evolution were true, and matching exactly
###546 what is described ten times in the first chapter of Genesis where God created
###549 everything to reproduce faithfully after its kind. This is powerful evidence for
###555 creation, and to say it's common in the fossil record is an understatement.
###559 [scary, dramatic music]
###565 Wahoo! Mail for me?
###567 [Scary, dramatic music]
###572 Wow - not only was there a lot of discussion on last week's show, there
###576 was a lot of good comments and questions brought - and I'm afraid, I won't
###580 be able to recite them all. GodHasNoMother did a fine job trying to
###584 explain prophecy and the gospel to those who would not hear.  I salute you!
###637 Good point - let us also remember the jawless fish fossils found in China in
###641 1999, allegedly dated 530 million years old, which is some 25 million years older
###647 than the Burgess shales, so that's another example of vertebrate fossils
###651 before our alleged ancient ancestor.
###673 That's why *I* am broadcasting from a different, top secret hideout every week.
###680 1whitemoon wrote in with an interesting question which stirred a lot of response:
###709 True, and while I don't really have a problem with people classifying
###713 organisms in this way, the classification in no way demonstrates evolution. For
###718 example - where on earth would you put the duckbilled platypus?  In fact this
###722 classification system was actually invented by a creationist, Linaeus, who
###726 referred to the organism groups as "species" because he believed they were
###730 SPECIAlly created.  I get a lot of people complaining about the term "kinds"
###735 asking for a definition of "kind," which is fair enough - but the problem is that for
###739 both definitions of species and kinds, you will have exceptions to the definition.  The
###745 bottom line here I wish to make though, is that classifying organisms does not affirm
###750 evolutionary ascent.
###753 MrAlienAssassin responded to 1whitemoon with:
###787 This canard was actually answered decades ago.  The alleged "leg bones" are
###794 different between the males and females, because these bones serve a purpose in
###798 the reproductive systems of the cetaceans.  They are muscle anchors and
###802 claspers.  There are no vestigial hind limbs on cetaceans, they serve a very real
###808 purpose.
###830 Mazle (however you say that), seeing as how you cannot create a giraffe from
###834 scratch, then you are in absolutely no position to be criticizing the design of
###839 said giraffe.  You need to watch my CrEvo rant #67, poor design. It is horribly
###846 ignorant and arrogant to make such criticisms. The laryngial nerve argument
###851 was answered a long time ago by Dr. Jerry Bergman here:
###881 Okay - I have no idea what you're talking about - it's true that chickens have
###885 recessive genes for teeth- in fact, going by the fossil record, many birds had teeth
###888 that have been lost over time. That's reverse evolution.  As for "human teeth?"  I
###895 don't know who told you that, but I'd be asking for a reference.  Same with the tail -
###899 I don't know what to tell you because this person did not provide you with a
###902 reference.  So I'd call them on that and ask for a reference first.
###932 Thanks for writing in, and indeed, I recognize that if the science can meet an
###936 unbiased test, it will get published. As I previously mentioned, many creationists
###940 have published in peer reviewed journals. I've also been a part of the process, both
###944 as the one getting reviewed, and a reviewer. However, in this particular case,
###949 with Springer-Verlag, the executive vice president of corporate communications at
###954 Springer gave the reasons why the book was run through additional peer review:
###959 Springer was unaware of the role of the book editors had in the intelligent design
###964 movement, and said Springer does not "endorse intelligent design as a legitimate
###968 area of scientific research."  Notice he mentioned absolutely nothing of the
###973 content of the book. There was no problem - the book had already gone
###978 through vetting by two Springer reviewers.  It was only after Sanford's
###982 personal beliefs were brought up that the book was yanked.  This is open, flagrant
###987 bigotry.
###989 Several people asked why I didn't present proof OF creation.
###1043 Ah, but do not mistake confidence for smugness. I am confident, not smug.
###1049 There are numerous things wrong with your premise: First of all, as I'm sure
###1053 you're already aware, science cannot "prove" something, it can only "disprove"
###1058 something.  So all too often evidence FOR creation is also evidence AGAINST
###1063 evolution - the two happen at the same time.  Secondly, if you'd paid close
###1067 attention, you'll notice that I HAVE provided evidence FOR creation.  One bit
###1073 of evidence I've beat to death is stasis in the fossil record. Evolution requires
###1077 change over time - a gaining of novel features and functions in an organism
###1081 over time, and a fossil order.  I've showed over and over again with literally dozens
###1085 of examples, including the tetrapod footprints, how the alleged fossil
###1088 sequence is in the wrong order, and the organisms we find in the fossil record
###1093 show extinction and stasis - neither of which help evolution, and both of which
###1098 fit perfectly within the creation model.  Ten times in the first chapter of Genesis alone
###1103 it says God created life to reproduce after its KIND, therefore good evidence for
###1108 creation would be lifeforms showing little to no change between the fossil record
###1113 and modern times, which is exactly what we see.  We also see profound evidence
###1118 for a worldwide flood, which does two things: It refutes the idea of deep time,
###1123 because deep time is only used to explain away the evidence left behind by Noah's
###1126 flood, and it simultaneously affirms the Genesis account which talks about a
###1130 world wide flood.
###1132 And by the way - the footprints in the Tapeats sandstone are a dead-ringer
###1136 match to the footprints in the Coconino sandstone. Compare them for yourself.
###1154 Thanks for writing in NotJames, and yes, you are certainly welcome to disagree
###1179 Thank you to everyone who wrote in, and thank you for watching. I hope you'll join
