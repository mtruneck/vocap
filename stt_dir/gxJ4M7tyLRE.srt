0:0:0,229 --> 0:0:2,27
Why is the sky dark at night?


2
0:0:2,27 --> 0:0:6,33
You might think the answer is obvious - the
sun isn't up! But the only reason the sky


3
0:0:6,33 --> 0:0:10,869
looks blue during the day is that sunlight
scatters off of the atmosphere - if we didn’t


4
0:0:10,869 --> 0:0:15,239
have an atmosphere (like on the moon), the
sky would always be dark, even when the sun


5
0:0:15,239 --> 0:0:19,369
is shining. So let’s rephrase the question
- why is space dark?


6
0:0:19,369 --> 0:0:23,74
I mean, space is full of stars - countless
stars which are all about as bright as the


7
0:0:23,74 --> 0:0:27,949
sun, and in an infinite eternal universe,
no matter what direction you picked, if you


8
0:0:27,949 --> 0:0:32,86
looked far enough in that direction, you would
see a star or galaxy. So the whole sky should


9
0:0:32,86 --> 0:0:35,809
be as bright as the sun, night and day!


10
0:0:35,809 --> 0:0:39,37
And since it's not, does the darkness of the
night sky mean that there's some distance


11
0:0:39,37 --> 0:0:45,7
away from us when stars and galaxies just…
stop? A boundary between something and nothing?


12
0:0:45,7 --> 0:0:46,93
An "edge" to the universe?


13
0:0:46,93 --> 0:0:53,519
Not exactly - all of our evidence seems to
indicate that space has no edge. But the universe


14
0:0:53,519 --> 0:0:59,859
itself does - not a spatial edge, but a temporal
one: as far as we know, the universe had


15
0:0:59,859 --> 0:1:4,47
a beginning. Or at least, a time about 13.7
billion years ago when the universe was so


16
0:1:4,47 --> 0:1:9,61
small and crumpled-up with itself that our
standard notion of space and time breaks down.


17
0:1:9,61 --> 0:1:13,48
And since only a finite amount of time has
passed since this so-called beginning, that


18
0:1:13,48 --> 0:1:17,25
means that some of the stars necessary to
fill up the "brightness in every direction"


19
0:1:17,25 --> 0:1:21,29
are so far away that light from them plain
hasn't had time to reach us yet… it's as


20
0:1:21,29 --> 0:1:24,88
if the universe were a big thunderstorm and
we're still waiting to hear the thunder from


21
0:1:24,88 --> 0:1:26,64
the really distant stars.


22
0:1:26,64 --> 0:1:31,0
But wait, it’s better than that - since
light takes time to travel across the universe,


23
0:1:31,0 --> 0:1:34,47
when we point our telescopes at something
really far away, we're actually seeing that


24
0:1:34,47 --> 0:1:39,75
part of universe as it was when the light
was emitted. So when we look at 13.5 billion-year-old


25
0:1:39,75 --> 0:1:43,39
light, it's not that we don't see stars just
because light from them hasn't gotten to us


26
0:1:43,39 --> 0:1:47,53
yet - we don't see any stars because we’re
getting a peek at the universe before any


27
0:1:47,53 --> 0:1:52,29
stars had formed! A star-less universe! Now
that sounds to me like a pretty good reason


28
0:1:52,29 --> 0:1:54,45
why we look up and see a dark night sky.


29
0:1:54,45 --> 0:1:59,39
But… it’s not. I mean, it is true that
we can find points in the sky where there


30
0:1:59,39 --> 0:2:4,9
aren’t any stars by looking past the earliest
stars and thus farther back in time. But even


31
0:2:4,9 --> 0:2:9,929
when we point our telescopes past the earliest
stars, we still see light. Not starlight,


32
0:2:9,929 --> 0:2:14,489
but the light left over from the big bang.
And we detect this “cosmic background radiation”


33
0:2:14,489 --> 0:2:19,31
coming more or less evenly from all directions,
forming a background beyond the stars. So,


34
0:2:19,31 --> 0:2:23,79
I guess the night sky ISN’T actually dark
to begin with.


35
0:2:23,79 --> 0:2:28,99
Right... so if our telescopes tell us that
the night sky isn’t dark, then why does


36
0:2:28,99 --> 0:2:29,9
it look dark?


37
0:2:29,9 --> 0:2:33,409
Here’s a clue to the real answer: when the
Hubble telescope photographed the distant


38
0:2:33,409 --> 0:2:37,999
stars of the astoundingly beautiful Hubble
extreme deep field, it took the picture using


39
0:2:37,999 --> 0:2:43,409
an infrared camera. Why? Well, distant stars
and galaxies are moving away from us because


40
0:2:43,409 --> 0:2:47,78
the universe is expanding. So the same way
a record slowing down lowers the pitch of


41
0:2:47,78 --> 0:2:52,739
my voice, the doppler effect causes stars
moving away from us to become redder, and


42
0:2:52,739 --> 0:2:56,7
the farther away they are, the faster they
move away from us and the redder they become,


43
0:2:56,7 --> 0:3:1,73
until they become… infrared. And then we
can't see them any more. At least not with


44
0:3:1,73 --> 0:3:6,159
our human eyes - and that’s why the night
sky appears dark!


45
0:3:6,159 --> 0:3:11,499
In summary: If we lived in an infinite, unchanging
universe, the entire sky would be as bright


46
0:3:11,499 --> 0:3:15,4
as the sun. But the sky is dark at night,
both because the universe had a beginning


47
0:3:15,4 --> 0:3:19,23
so there aren't stars in every direction and
more importantly because the light from super


48
0:3:19,23 --> 0:3:23,84
distant stars (and the even-more-distant cosmic
background radiation) gets red-shifted away


49
0:3:23,84 --> 0:3:27,939
from the visible spectrum by the expansion
of the universe, so we just plain can't see


50
0:3:27,939 --> 0:3:28,51
it.


51
0:3:28,51 --> 0:5:28,51
Finally! We’ve shed some light on why the
night sky is dark. And why it isn’t.
