Hi lovely people of Food Tube. Look around
I am in Malta!


2
0:0:13,35 --> 0:0:21,92
I can't wait to start cooking today. I'm going
to cook a classic Italian lamb stew. You going


3
0:0:21,92 --> 0:0:25,3
to enjoy it.
You know what is look like? If you have ever


4
0:0:25,3 --> 0:0:30,83
been home for twenty years and then out of
the blue you go back home and your mamma,


5
0:0:30,83 --> 0:0:36,1
your friend, your pappa makes this dish. It
look like if you never left home.


6
0:0:36,1 --> 0:0:43,19
First shoulder of lamb, put them in a bowl.
Salt, not too much, a bit of pepper in. Mix


7
0:0:43,19 --> 0:0:47,44
it all together.
Extra virgin olive oil.


8
0:0:47,44 --> 0:0:55,299
Anchovies, yes! That is give them a little
bit extra salt, make sure you melt those anchovies.


9
0:0:55,299 --> 0:1:6,369
Now, lamb goes in. oh yes! Seal it.
It means, you make sure that the meat is all,


10
0:1:6,369 --> 0:1:13,45
almost roasted, almost until all around. It
keeps the lovely flavour inside. Look at the


11
0:1:13,45 --> 0:1:17,91
lovely colour.
You can see all the anchovies dissolved.


12
0:1:17,91 --> 0:1:26,1
Now I'm starting with a carrot. I cleaned
this one I did not remove the skin. Cut it,


13
0:1:26,1 --> 0:1:34,96
don't do it too small. Look at the colour!
Mmm. Oh. Straight in.


14
0:1:34,96 --> 0:1:45,14
Give them a little stir now.
Now two onions should be enough to one kilo


15
0:1:45,14 --> 0:1:56,59
of meat which will feed well four people.
I just chop them roughly. Yes.


16
0:1:56,59 --> 0:2:5,87
Here in Malta this is the celery they have
so I use the leaves for later.


17
0:2:5,87 --> 0:2:17,999
And then slowly you chop it. Look all in.
Such a simple dish to make. Give them a stir.


18
0:2:17,999 --> 0:2:23,95
This is what we call a modore.
A modore is a, is a, a kind of a, a sense


19
0:2:23,95 --> 0:2:29,489
of a flavour.
Keep stirring it, do not turn off the hear


20
0:2:29,489 --> 0:2:36,329
because you wont to get a lot of water out.
Let the juice seal everything nicely.


21
0:2:36,329 --> 0:2:41,739
Now I put a couple of clove of garlic.
Look what I do with the clove of garlic, I


22
0:2:41,739 --> 0:2:49,379
press it remove it the skin, goes straight
in.


23
0:2:49,379 --> 0:2:56,95
Next is the chilli. Do you know if the chilli
is very strong, you break it, you smell it.


24
0:2:56,95 --> 0:3:6,1
Oh this is strong, I will use, for four people
half a chilli. Straight in. I keep stirring


25
0:3:6,1 --> 0:3:9,98
it.
Nearly, nearly there.


26
0:3:9,98 --> 0:3:17,9
Now thyme, let your feeling go walking in.
It's like to fall in love, you want to caress


27
0:3:17,9 --> 0:3:25,549
your love. And this is what it does.
Look at that inside here! Yeah!


28
0:3:25,549 --> 0:3:37,189
Wine. You put inside about a glass of wine.
Keep stirring it. And let almost all of this


29
0:3:37,189 --> 0:3:48,319
wine evaporate. You need to balance with a
bit of vinegar. White wine vinegar.


30
0:3:48,319 --> 0:3:55,299
Wow! Everything dance inside there. It is
a celebration. the smell which is overtaking


31
0:3:55,299 --> 0:3:58,569
you!
I'm going to keep the smell the flavour all


32
0:3:58,569 --> 0:4:4,93
inside, so I need a lid. I improvised one.
Aluminium foil, you can do exactly the same


33
0:4:4,93 --> 0:4:12,68
cover. Turn it down and let's wait in for
20minute and I will show you what's happen.


34
0:4:12,68 --> 0:4:21,84
Oh, my my!
Taste it wise. Yes! Yup, this is the way I


35
0:4:21,84 --> 0:4:35,85
want it. Now potato, three potato. You cut
it, easy, put it inside. Yes.


36
0:4:35,85 --> 0:4:45,47
Now, I need the extra little bit of salt.
It's for the potato only and it will be pepper


37
0:4:45,47 --> 0:4:52,8
because pepper is a spice. Cherry tomatoes.
It's like a little plum tomato. They're so


38
0:4:52,8 --> 0:4:57,69
sweet, so good. It's incredible.
Straight in. Give them a quite stir.


39
0:4:57,69 --> 0:5:6,83
Now at this stage, you need to add to it about
250ml of stock. Mix everything together. You


40
0:5:6,83 --> 0:5:15,2
turn the gas down. Cover it again and cook
it for about 35 minute to 40minutes.


41
0:5:15,2 --> 0:5:28,42
Look how tender, I can squeeze everything
out. Mmmmm. So good! I can taste the flavour


42
0:5:28,42 --> 0:5:35,33
of everythings. Now I have here some frozen
peas. If this was fresh I would have put in


43
0:5:35,33 --> 0:5:41,25
about 20 minutes ago. Fantastic. Look at that
the colour already.


44
0:5:41,25 --> 0:5:48,48
Give them a quick stir. While this one is
cooking. Maltese bread, yes!


45
0:5:48,48 --> 0:6:1,25
Ah, yup this is ready. Ahh. Let's turn this
one off.


46
0:6:1,25 --> 0:6:9,67
Celery leaves, chop them up very fine. Lovely.
A little bit of extra virgin olive oil.


47
0:6:9,67 --> 0:6:18,81
And this is my classic Italian lamb stew,
which I've done with a shoulder but you can


48
0:6:18,81 --> 0:6:31,72
do with a leg. My god, it's so good!
It is incredible because I'm eating the stew,


49
0:6:31,72 --> 0:6:39,36
bring memories back. With the family, with
the friends. What a celebration. My god, it's


50
0:6:39,36 --> 0:6:45,1
so good! So good! I'm sorry, I am sorry this
time.

0:6:45,1 --> 0:6:56,36
