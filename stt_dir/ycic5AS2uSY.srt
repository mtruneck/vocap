1
0:0:27,267 --> 0:0:31,307
'Don't screw this up.
No screw-ups. Got to impress! '


2
0:0:31,307 --> 0:0:37,147
So Mr Corrigan, we've examined your
loan application and I have one question.


3
0:0:37,147 --> 0:0:40,67
Are you a pathetic, worthless punk?


4
0:0:40,67 --> 0:0:41,747
Er, well, no.


5
0:0:41,747 --> 0:0:46,587
Right. Because I'm going to turn you
down as if you were a hippy parasite.


6
0:0:46,587 --> 0:0:49,627
'Oh, yes. Yeah, I like it. '


7
0:0:49,627 --> 0:0:52,67
Then I'll make you feel like
a turkey fucker.


8
0:0:52,67 --> 0:0:56,867
Why? Because I'm the big man
and you're a shit heel, right?


9
0:0:56,867 --> 0:1:0,147
'Brilliant. That is just so spot on. '


10
0:1:0,147 --> 0:1:5,387
Or... I could treat Mr Corrigan
like a valued and respected customer


11
0:1:5,387 --> 0:1:7,427
and we'd both end up winners.


12
0:1:7,427 --> 0:1:11,467
- Isn't that right, Mr Corrigan?
- Right. Absolutely!


13
0:1:11,467 --> 0:1:16,467
- Dead right.
- 'Alan Johnson, I'm in love.


14
0:1:16,467 --> 0:1:18,627
'I'm in love with you, Johnson. '


15
0:1:18,627 --> 0:1:21,307
'There are two basic energies
in the world.


16
0:1:21,307 --> 0:1:23,507
'Stress and relaxation. '


17
0:1:23,507 --> 0:1:26,627
Super Hans...


18
0:1:26,627 --> 0:1:28,667
- What are we doing?
- We...


19
0:1:28,667 --> 0:1:33,307
are looking through
the other end of the telescope.


20
0:1:33,307 --> 0:1:35,427
I don't feel very well.


21
0:1:35,427 --> 0:1:38,667
- Did something bad happen?
- Everything's OK.


22
0:1:38,667 --> 0:1:42,547
There's two basic energies in the world -
stress and relaxation.


23
0:1:42,547 --> 0:1:46,587
- Did I break through?
- You passed out after the love beans.


24
0:1:46,587 --> 0:1:50,147
I thought the table was being ironic.


25
0:1:50,147 --> 0:1:53,627
But what was the bad thing?


26
0:1:53,627 --> 0:1:55,667
'Floss is boss. Floss is boss. '


27
0:1:55,667 --> 0:1:59,187
- Floss is boss!
- 'No, not that.


28
0:1:59,187 --> 0:2:0,947
'Something worse. '


29
0:2:0,947 --> 0:2:4,947
- What happened?
- That will probably become clear later.


30
0:2:4,947 --> 0:2:7,267
Like the French Revolution.


31
0:2:7,267 --> 0:2:10,267
- I think we need to tidy up.
- Absolutely not.


32
0:2:10,267 --> 0:2:16,347
That is the one thing I stand against.
A thousand times, no.


33
0:2:16,347 --> 0:2:18,787
Hi! Come in, come in.


34
0:2:18,787 --> 0:2:20,667
- Hi, guys.
- Hiya, Soph.


35
0:2:20,667 --> 0:2:23,27
- How's it going?
- Oh, good, thanks.


36
0:2:23,27 --> 0:2:25,227
'Ask her to go to the bar. Ask her! '


37
0:2:25,227 --> 0:2:28,787
We're just watching a bit of Morse.
Care to join us?


38
0:2:28,787 --> 0:2:31,987
I don't think right now. Er, Mark...


39
0:2:31,987 --> 0:2:34,707
- I just wanted to say about the lift.
- 8:15 sharp?


40
0:2:34,707 --> 0:2:37,667
Yeah. I forgot about Debbie's wheelchair.


41
0:2:37,667 --> 0:2:40,547
- Yeah?
- I think it'll take quite a bit of room.


42
0:2:40,547 --> 0:2:44,827
- Right, well, that...
- Dave's helping her so I said to him...


43
0:2:44,827 --> 0:2:46,987
I mean, I could... help.


44
0:2:46,987 --> 0:2:51,707
Yeah... Yeah, sure.
It's just Dave's been, you know...


45
0:2:51,707 --> 0:2:54,507
Oh, yeah. Totally. Absolutely.


46
0:2:54,507 --> 0:2:57,467
'Dave's the saint.
Nothing must unseat Dave. '


47
0:2:57,467 --> 0:3:2,27
I'm really sorry. I'm sure you'll be able
to get another lift or a train.


48
0:3:2,27 --> 0:3:4,467
- Honestly, it's fine.
- Sorry.


49
0:3:4,467 --> 0:3:6,867
Thanks. Well, see ya.


50
0:3:6,867 --> 0:3:8,107
Bye.


51
0:3:8,107 --> 0:3:15,227
- Night.
- OK, night.


52
0:3:15,227 --> 0:3:17,347
'Yes, I know what you're thinking.


53
0:3:17,347 --> 0:3:20,947
'I'm shit, you're great.
I'm the worm, you're the king.


54
0:3:20,947 --> 0:3:27,107
'Eat your nuts and go fuck yourself. '


55
0:3:27,107 --> 0:3:32,347
'Oh, I feel like loam, a piece
of loam. Jesus, what am I talking about?


56
0:3:32,347 --> 0:3:37,27
'I wish Mark was here. No more drugs.
I don't need drugs.


57
0:3:37,27 --> 0:3:40,347
'I mean, what great music
was ever made on drugs?


58
0:3:40,347 --> 0:3:45,587
'Bowie, obviously. The Floyd, the
Prodge, Aphex - the list is endless really.

0:3:45,587 --> 0:3:50,587
'But they could have done it twice as fast
with half the mess if they just...


60
0:3:50,587 --> 0:3:59,67
'Ah, was that the bad thing?


61
0:3:59,67 --> 0:4:1,187
'Not that. Something wronger.


62
0:4:1,187 --> 0:4:4,907
'Mark'll be so pleased when he sees this.
He's just so...

0:4:4,907 --> 0:4:7,662
'Maybe I could open
my bank statements.


64
0:4:7,662 --> 0:4:10,307
'Maybe you can be boring and cool. '

'I only asked about the bus.
I'm not a freak.

you is liable for the cashews. " Sophie...

'This is the worst thing to happen
to anyone ever. Oh, my fucking life.

0:4:34,867 --> 0:4:38,427
- 'It's Alan Johnson. '
- Mark! It is Mark, isn't it?


73
0:4:38,427 --> 0:4:41,347
- Yes, it is. It's Mark.
- So?


74
0:4:41,347 --> 0:4:44,107
- Do you want a lift or what?
- I would love a lift.


75
0:4:44,107 --> 0:4:48,107
'Shit! This is the best thing
to happen to anyone ever. '

80
0:5:4,587 --> 0:5:7,147
- Jez?
- Hey, you're back! This is great.


81
0:5:7,147 --> 0:5:8,987
- You're really back.
- Er, yes.


82
0:5:8,987 --> 0:5:13,467
The El Dude Brothers are back in town.
Aaaggh! Aaaggh!


83
0:5:13,467 --> 0:5:15,507
Uhhhh. Uhhhh.


84
0:5:15,507 --> 0:5:20,587
Come on in. Sit down. Tell me all about
your trip. I want to hear everything -


85
0:5:20,587 --> 0:5:22,987
all the gory details.


86
0:5:22,987 --> 0:5:26,147
Did you bring back any little tiny soaps?


87
0:5:26,147 --> 0:5:29,467
- Jez, are you all right?
- Course I am. Now you're back.


88
0:5:29,467 --> 0:5:34,387
Right. That's very nice and everything,
Jez, but I should open some wine.


89
0:5:34,387 --> 0:5:38,227
- Rather a good friend is coming over.
- Wine?


90
0:5:38,227 --> 0:5:39,987
Friend?


91
0:5:39,987 --> 0:5:43,347
But you haven't got a friend.
Who's your friend?


92
0:5:43,347 --> 0:5:45,627
Phoney Tony, I call him.


93
0:5:45,627 --> 0:5:48,467
This government is all spin,
it's smoke and mirrors.


94
0:5:48,467 --> 0:5:51,67
I totally agree. I couldn't agree more.


95
0:5:51,67 --> 0:5:54,707
- The way he licks Bush's arse.
- Pathetic!


96
0:5:54,707 --> 0:5:58,467
They're spending more on schools
but where's the evidence?


97
0:5:58,467 --> 0:6:3,267
What schools? Where? Where the heck
are they? Can you see them?


98
0:6:3,267 --> 0:6:8,187
'This is good. Yeah, three guys
sitting around, shooting the shit.


99
0:6:8,187 --> 0:6:13,187
'Politics doesn't have to be boring.
A lot of Moby's stuff is political, I think. '


100
0:6:13,187 --> 0:6:16,627
Yeah, it's all lies, isn't it?


101
0:6:16,627 --> 0:6:21,787
Don't tell me that Blair wears a suit
when he's at home watching Big Brother.


102
0:6:21,787 --> 0:6:25,907
- 'God. Not in front of Johnson. '
- How do you mean exactly?


103
0:6:25,907 --> 0:6:27,947
They should be more honest.


104
0:6:27,947 --> 0:6:30,427
At least, Tony Adams from the IRA,


105
0:6:30,427 --> 0:6:34,67
he's like, "Yeah, I shoot people.
I like shooting people. "


106
0:6:34,67 --> 0:6:35,947
If they were more honest,


107
0:6:35,947 --> 0:6:40,227
maybe people wouldn't switch
straight over when the news comes on.


108
0:6:40,227 --> 0:6:42,307
You turn over when the news comes on?


109
0:6:42,307 --> 0:6:45,667
No, no. No, sometimes...


110
0:6:45,667 --> 0:6:48,307
maybe for a treat, but generally, it's
great.


111
0:6:48,307 --> 0:6:52,507
Who do you support?
I mean, Mark likes Israel, I'm Palestine.


112
0:6:52,507 --> 0:6:55,787
Makes it more interesting
when you pick a...


113
0:6:55,787 --> 0:6:57,547
No?


114
0:6:57,547 --> 0:7:1,27
So I'll show you
what I've done so far on the book.


115
0:7:1,27 --> 0:7:4,547
- The book?
- Business Secrets Of The Pharaohs.


116
0:7:4,547 --> 0:7:7,867
It's only chapter one,
but it gives a flavour...


117
0:7:7,867 --> 0:7:10,187
'Oh, my God. The bad thing.


118
0:7:10,187 --> 0:7:13,307
'That's the bad thing! '


119
0:7:13,307 --> 0:7:16,107
Make a tsunami!


120
0:7:16,107 --> 0:7:18,867
Can I have a look?


121
0:7:18,867 --> 0:7:20,627
It doesn't seem to...


122
0:7:20,627 --> 0:7:22,587
Oh! Oh, dear.


123
0:7:22,587 --> 0:7:25,267
Look what you've... Oh, is it all right?


124
0:7:25,267 --> 0:7:29,187
- Well, no, but it wasn't working when...
- Oh, yes, it was.


125
0:7:29,187 --> 0:7:34,747
It was working fine and then you spilt
your drink on it. That's what happened.


126
0:7:34,747 --> 0:7:37,507
That's what I saw.


127
0:7:37,507 --> 0:7:41,147
'Me and Johnson.
We only met a fortnight ago.


128
0:7:41,147 --> 0:7:45,907
'Everything's happening so fast. '
That sounds... That sounds just...


129
0:7:45,907 --> 0:7:51,27
- amazing.
- Excellent. Second.


130
0:7:51,27 --> 0:7:54,867
Yeah, but the relocation thing,
moving out on Jeremy,


131
0:7:54,867 --> 0:7:57,987
- it feels a bit weird, Dad.
- 'Shit! '


132
0:7:57,987 --> 0:8:0,707
- Sorry?
- It feels weird, daddio.


133
0:8:0,707 --> 0:8:3,227
- 'Good save. '
- Why, daddio? Third.


134
0:8:3,227 --> 0:8:9,67
Well, nowadays, email and so forth,
do I really need to move to Cardiff?


135
0:8:9,67 --> 0:8:13,27
Let me tell you a story.
It's about two mountain climbers.


136
0:8:13,27 --> 0:8:19,667
One's climbing. The other one is injured,
weak, clinging to the first guy's leg.


137
0:8:19,667 --> 0:8:22,867
- Uh-huh. Interesting.
- The first guy has a choice.


138
0:8:22,867 --> 0:8:26,347
Let his pal cling on
and they're both yak food or...


139
0:8:26,347 --> 0:8:29,107
shake him off and make it to the top -


140
0:8:29,107 --> 0:8:31,907
solo.


141
0:8:31,907 --> 0:8:35,627
'I've got to tell him.
How am I going to tell him?


142
0:8:35,627 --> 0:8:38,387
'Oh, this is horrible. He might crumble.


143
0:8:38,387 --> 0:8:41,27
'He's weak. Remember the Johnson. '


144
0:8:41,27 --> 0:8:43,227
- Hey, Jez!
- Hey.


145
0:8:43,227 --> 0:8:47,267
So, what do you make of this place?
You choose what you want.


146
0:8:47,267 --> 0:8:52,587
'This could be good. Just like
the old days. Don't slag off Johnson yet. '


147
0:8:52,587 --> 0:8:56,707
Johnson told me about it. According to
Johnson, wasabi sauce is...


148
0:8:56,707 --> 0:8:58,907
Oh, Johnson says, Johnson says!


149
0:8:58,907 --> 0:9:2,507
If you love Johnson that much,
why don't you marry him?


150
0:9:2,507 --> 0:9:5,107
Where did this come from
all of a sudden?


151
0:9:5,107 --> 0:9:9,267
Why don't you actually screw him,
since you clearly want to so much?


152
0:9:9,267 --> 0:9:11,227
Jeremy!


153
0:9:11,227 --> 0:9:15,787
I've got nothing against being gay
but I'm not and neither is Johnson.


154
0:9:15,787 --> 0:9:18,627
He's black,
which I expect you've noticed.


155
0:9:18,627 --> 0:9:21,787
So just because he's black,
I have to like him.


156
0:9:21,787 --> 0:9:26,707
Do I? That's political correctness
gone mad. Look, Mark, I'm sorry...


157
0:9:26,707 --> 0:9:32,187
'Jesus, I'm just the sort of person
who'd be gay and repressive to himself. '


158
0:9:32,187 --> 0:9:35,427
The thing is, well...


159
0:9:35,427 --> 0:9:40,827
There's no easy way to put this
but... Johnson's invited me in with him.


160
0:9:40,827 --> 0:9:43,747
He wants me to get into bed,
team up with him.


161
0:9:43,747 --> 0:9:47,827
- It would mean relocating to Cardiff.
- You're kidding?


162
0:9:47,827 --> 0:9:51,827
Look, I really feel
I need to go for this, Jez.


163
0:9:51,827 --> 0:9:54,347
Look, it's not as if it's the end... for us.


164
0:9:54,347 --> 0:9:58,787
We're still the El Dude Brothers.
We always will be. It's just...


165
0:9:58,787 --> 0:10:0,987
I'm leaving.


166
0:10:0,987 --> 0:10:3,907
I can't spend my life with you
at base camp.


167
0:10:3,907 --> 0:10:5,947
OK, OK...


168
0:10:5,947 --> 0:10:9,347
That's fine. I'm fine with that.


169
0:10:9,347 --> 0:10:11,707
Good.


170
0:10:11,707 --> 0:10:17,387
'If I keep smiling,
maybe he won't leave. '


171
0:10:17,387 --> 0:10:19,307
This is a pretty cool place, isn't it?


172
0:10:19,307 --> 0:10:22,347
Chopsticks.


173
0:10:22,347 --> 0:10:26,347
Hmm, these are a bit long for me
actually.


174
0:10:26,347 --> 0:10:29,507
'He's cracked.
I hope he doesn't do anything drastic. '


175
0:10:29,507 --> 0:10:33,627
That's better.
So tell me all about the wasabi sauce.


176
0:10:33,627 --> 0:10:35,707
'If he hangs himself,


177
0:10:35,707 --> 0:10:41,347
'I could put an orange in his mouth
and say it was a fatal wanking accident. '


178
0:10:41,347 --> 0:10:44,507
I'm so glad
you came here for a follow-up, man.


179
0:10:44,507 --> 0:10:49,227
You totally blew apart Barbara's
whole stone-age business paradigm.


180
0:10:49,227 --> 0:10:51,267
Like taking candy from a baby.


181
0:10:51,267 --> 0:10:54,427
'Maybe I do fancy him.
He's handsome.


182
0:10:54,427 --> 0:11:0,467
'Not in a gay way. It's just obvious.
He's a good-looking guy - a guy's guy.


183
0:11:0,467 --> 0:11:2,587
- 'But would I...? '
- Hey, Mark.


184
0:11:2,587 --> 0:11:4,187
Sophie!


185
0:11:4,187 --> 0:11:7,307
Sophie, Sophie, Sophie!
You know Alan, of course.


186
0:11:7,307 --> 0:11:10,627
Yeah, quite a seminar.
Barbara went home crying.


187
0:11:10,627 --> 0:11:13,587
I'm just a doctor.
I didn't make the needles sharp.


188
0:11:13,587 --> 0:11:16,147
It's not a wig, Alan.
That's actually her hair.


189
0:11:16,147 --> 0:11:19,667
You've got to admit,
she was asking a lot of questions.


190
0:11:19,667 --> 0:11:23,787
- Thought you big kahunas should know.
- Yeah, whatever.


191
0:11:23,787 --> 0:11:26,227
See you.


192
0:11:26,227 --> 0:11:28,707
Jesus, some people!


193
0:11:28,707 --> 0:11:33,27
You point them to a lift
and they're like, "No, I'll take the stairs. "


194
0:11:33,27 --> 0:11:37,227
'I do want to be with him
but could I think about kissing?


195
0:11:37,227 --> 0:11:39,187
'Well, I'm thinking about it.


196
0:11:39,187 --> 0:11:42,307
'No, I'm just thinking
about thinking about it. '


197
0:11:42,307 --> 0:11:44,747
Yeah, she's very...


198
0:11:44,747 --> 0:11:49,787
Yeah... I could have a little thing
going there with Sophie actually.


199
0:11:49,787 --> 0:11:52,907
- Well, my advice is keep it little.
- Yeah?


200
0:11:52,907 --> 0:11:57,667
Women? Does a balance sheet ever cry
and say it needs time to think?


201
0:11:57,667 --> 0:12:1,947
Business doesn't say it loves you
then runs off with a buddy.


202
0:12:1,947 --> 0:12:5,507
Take a look at her, mate.
Take a good, hard look at her.


203
0:12:5,507 --> 0:12:8,107
What do you see?
What do you see in her,


204
0:12:8,107 --> 0:12:11,907
compared to, say,
a supermodel like Giselle?


205
0:12:11,907 --> 0:12:13,947
She's...


206
0:12:13,947 --> 0:12:16,307
I think she's... very pretty.


207
0:12:16,307 --> 0:12:19,347
Come on, look at her arse.


208
0:12:19,347 --> 0:12:24,147
Is that the best arse you're ever
going to get? Do you stick on that arse?


209
0:12:24,147 --> 0:12:27,147
She's got a fat arse.


210
0:12:27,147 --> 0:12:29,347
- Say it.
- Well, she's...


211
0:12:29,347 --> 0:12:31,547
Maybe it is a bit...


212
0:12:31,547 --> 0:12:33,587
nice, but in a sense...


213
0:12:33,587 --> 0:12:36,507
If we're gonna do this,
it's just you and me.


214
0:12:36,507 --> 0:12:39,587
No stress-buster mini-breaks, no women.


215
0:12:39,587 --> 0:12:43,507
Just us, a pile of Chinese food
and some fuck-off spreadsheets.


216
0:12:43,507 --> 0:12:50,187
'Oh, yes, take me, Johnson.
I'm yours! '


217
0:12:50,187 --> 0:12:52,707
Yeah, Jeremy and Super Hans.


218
0:12:52,707 --> 0:12:55,707
This is perfect
because I'm being evicted soon.


219
0:12:55,707 --> 0:12:59,347
We are gonna have parties in this place
that go beyond fun


220
0:12:59,347 --> 0:13:2,27
and actually get really, really nasty.


221
0:13:2,27 --> 0:13:4,107
When's the Iron Duke moving out?


222
0:13:4,107 --> 0:13:7,947
Erm, I dunno. Maybe a few weeks.


223
0:13:7,947 --> 0:13:12,587
- Nothing's really decided yet.
- As a fuck-off present, let's spike him.


224
0:13:12,587 --> 0:13:15,667
Yeah... or maybe get him
a nice watch or...


225
0:13:15,667 --> 0:13:18,187
He'll be like,
"Can't make the meeting, boss.


226
0:13:18,187 --> 0:13:22,667
"I've gotta fax my soul off to God
for an upgrade. "


227
0:13:22,667 --> 0:13:26,107
'It could be all right.
Mark can make us a cleaning rota.


228
0:13:26,107 --> 0:13:31,187
'We'll just stick religiously to the rota. '


229
0:13:31,187 --> 0:13:34,747
'There's probably much less
to worry about with gay sex.


230
0:13:34,747 --> 0:13:37,27
'You know where you are with a cock.


231
0:13:37,27 --> 0:13:40,307
'Still, even if I am gay, Johnson isn't.


232
0:13:40,307 --> 0:13:43,867
'It'll be hard enough
turning me gay, let alone... '


233
0:13:43,867 --> 0:13:46,387
- Hiya, Mark.
- 'OK, listen to the Johnson. '


234
0:13:46,387 --> 0:13:48,667
- Huh.
- 'Yes, take that. '


235
0:13:48,667 --> 0:13:50,507
- How are you?
- Oh, you know...


236
0:13:50,507 --> 0:13:52,747
'Stay strong, brother. '


237
0:13:52,747 --> 0:13:57,307
I've been meaning to say, about
the other day, back from the hotel...


238
0:13:57,307 --> 0:14:1,27
- Didn't phase me, sweetheart.
- 'That's a bit too much. '


239
0:14:1,27 --> 0:14:4,267
Yeah. Because, in the end,
Dave had to go early.


240
0:14:4,267 --> 0:14:7,947
Then I knocked on your door
and Jess said you'd gone.


241
0:14:7,947 --> 0:14:11,587
So that's what happened,
in case you were wondering.


242
0:14:11,587 --> 0:14:16,627
- Whatever.
- 'That's all very possible. '


243
0:14:16,627 --> 0:14:20,147
- Are you OK? You weren't pissed off?
- 'Don't weaken. '


244
0:14:20,147 --> 0:14:22,467
- No, no. Why?
- You seem a bit...


245
0:14:22,467 --> 0:14:26,827
I dunno. I hope everything's still,
with us, yeah, all right.


246
0:14:26,827 --> 0:14:33,187
'This is ridiculous. She's beautiful.
I'm not gay. Forget Johnson. Go for it! '


247
0:14:33,187 --> 0:14:34,667
Oh, Mark!


248
0:14:34,667 --> 0:14:36,707
- Are you all right?
- Fine.


249
0:14:36,707 --> 0:14:38,467
No, it's fine...


250
0:14:38,467 --> 0:14:40,627
Just... nothing. A bump.


251
0:14:40,627 --> 0:14:45,427
'It's staring you in the face, Mark.
There's only one other sex to try. '


252
0:14:45,427 --> 0:14:48,307
'Good old, unfriendly Mr Patel.


253
0:14:48,307 --> 0:14:53,227
'Never says a word, whether
you're buying cornflakes, fabric softener


254
0:14:53,227 --> 0:14:56,827
'or gay porn.


255
0:14:56,827 --> 0:14:59,587
'So here we go. Watch without prejudice.


256
0:14:59,587 --> 0:15:4,747
'I'm just testing the water.
I'm a sexual scientist.


257
0:15:4,747 --> 0:15:7,427
'So, OK, I'm keeping in trim.


258
0:15:7,427 --> 0:15:9,707
'This is fine. Typical evening in.


259
0:15:9,707 --> 0:15:14,307
'Johnson's doing the spreadsheet.
There's nothing to be afraid of.


260
0:15:14,307 --> 0:15:16,827
'The Romans liked it
and they got a lot done.


261
0:15:16,827 --> 0:15:19,147
'How's it going, Johnson? Ha-ha!


262
0:15:19,147 --> 0:15:21,187
'So quick?!


263
0:15:21,187 --> 0:15:23,547
'Yeah, some good kissing.


264
0:15:23,547 --> 0:15:27,347
'Maybe I'm bi-curious.
What if that actually was Johnson?


265
0:15:27,347 --> 0:15:29,387
'Would that make me hotter?


266
0:15:29,387 --> 0:15:34,67
'What if he had Sophie's face
or Sophie's body with Johnson's face?


267
0:15:34,67 --> 0:15:37,547
'Mum, Dad, I'm bi-curious.
Yeah, right, the bum.


268
0:15:37,547 --> 0:15:41,467
'Nothing wrong with a bum...


269
0:15:41,467 --> 0:15:51,227
'Ah, that's a little too rich for me.
I just don't know! '


270
0:15:51,227 --> 0:15:56,787
Do you think he really wondered, Sting,
if the Russians loved their children too?


271
0:15:56,787 --> 0:15:59,627
No, it's a rhetorical question.


272
0:15:59,627 --> 0:16:3,147
Like Can You Feel The Force?
Or Do They Know It's Christmas?


273
0:16:3,147 --> 0:16:6,947
I'm not so sure.
He really seems to be sincerely hoping


274
0:16:6,947 --> 0:16:12,507
that the Russians love their children too,
which I think is a little bit patronising.


275
0:16:12,507 --> 0:16:18,867
I really need to pick up my laptop from
the IT guy before Johnson gets here.


276
0:16:18,867 --> 0:16:21,27
I could... drive you.


277
0:16:21,27 --> 0:16:23,787
- What?
- Well, he gave you the keys.


278
0:16:23,787 --> 0:16:26,227
No, he forgot the keys after the pub.


279
0:16:26,227 --> 0:16:30,587
Then he called to put me in charge
of the keys until he reclaims the keys.


280
0:16:30,587 --> 0:16:36,947
It's probably an initiative test. Will you...
walk like some kind of stupid duck


281
0:16:36,947 --> 0:16:38,827
or will you drive like...


282
0:16:38,827 --> 0:16:40,587
Clarkson?


283
0:16:40,587 --> 0:16:42,747
What if something happened?


284
0:16:42,747 --> 0:16:47,547
Oh, right, suddenly I'm going to drive off
the non-existent quayside.


285
0:16:47,547 --> 0:16:50,947
I'm insured on my mum's insurance
to drive any car.


286
0:16:50,947 --> 0:16:55,387
It's freezing out there.
Johnson won't mind, if he's a real mate.


287
0:16:55,387 --> 0:16:58,987
- You're insured on any car?
- Yes!


288
0:16:58,987 --> 0:17:3,67
'Probably. '


289
0:17:3,67 --> 0:17:8,27
'Who's the Johnson now, huh?
Who's the Johnson now, Johnson? '


290
0:17:8,27 --> 0:17:10,347
Shall we... open her up a bit?


291
0:17:10,347 --> 0:17:13,747
No, absolutely not!
We're almost at the office now.


292
0:17:13,747 --> 0:17:17,627
If it feels good, do it.
Isn't that Johnson's philosophy?


293
0:17:17,627 --> 0:17:19,507
No.


294
0:17:19,507 --> 0:17:21,627
They love it really.


295
0:17:21,627 --> 0:17:26,307
God, Jeremy, no! That was Mica from...
I hope they didn't recognise me.


296
0:17:26,307 --> 0:17:32,627
What do you two do in the car then?
Sit and talk about the VAT on cigarillos?


297
0:17:32,627 --> 0:17:36,347
Of course not!
Sometimes he lets me do the gears.


298
0:17:36,347 --> 0:17:40,947
Hey, I've got an idea...


299
0:17:40,947 --> 0:17:43,307
This doesn't feel right.


300
0:17:43,307 --> 0:17:45,707
- This is so right.
- But I can't drive.


301
0:17:45,707 --> 0:17:52,107
Yes, you can. All you have to do
is believe. Driving is bullshit.


302
0:17:52,107 --> 0:17:53,347
Oh


303
0:17:53,347 --> 0:17:54,587
my


304
0:17:54,587 --> 0:17:55,707
God.


305
0:17:55,707 --> 0:17:58,587
Just very slowly
take your foot off the clutch


306
0:17:58,587 --> 0:18:1,107
and just tickle the accelerator, OK?


307
0:18:1,107 --> 0:18:3,147
OK.


308
0:18:3,147 --> 0:18:4,907
OK...


309
0:18:4,907 --> 0:18:6,827
OK.


310
0:18:6,827 --> 0:18:9,347
Look at me go! I'm driving!


311
0:18:9,347 --> 0:18:11,107
Look at me driving, Jez!


312
0:18:11,107 --> 0:18:14,667
- You're driving. Very slowly in first gear.
- Yeah.


313
0:18:14,667 --> 0:18:20,667
Yeah, come on. I'm driving. I'm Johnson.
Driving is bullshit! I'm Johnson!


314
0:18:20,667 --> 0:18:22,787
That's right. It's easy.


315
0:18:22,787 --> 0:18:26,187
Now, just give it a bit more juice
and hang a right.


316
0:18:26,187 --> 0:18:28,347
Right is bollocks. I'm going rogue.


317
0:18:28,347 --> 0:18:30,867
- Hey, isn't that Sophie?
- Jesus.


318
0:18:30,867 --> 0:18:34,267
Yeah, h-how do I...
How do I do stopping?


319
0:18:34,267 --> 0:18:41,27
The pedal. No, the middle one!


320
0:18:41,27 --> 0:18:45,187
- Blimey, Mark, when did you...?
- What? This old banger?


321
0:18:45,187 --> 0:18:47,987
It's not, is it? It's a brand-new Beamer.


322
0:18:47,987 --> 0:18:52,307
And you'd probably like a spin,
but we're just tooling around town.


323
0:18:52,307 --> 0:18:54,67
It's a guy thing.


324
0:18:54,67 --> 0:18:56,827
- Right.
- You sure you're all right to...?


325
0:18:56,827 --> 0:18:58,307
It's cool, Jez.


326
0:18:58,307 --> 0:19:3,747
See you around, Soph.


327
0:19:3,747 --> 0:19:8,267
Oh, Jesus...


328
0:19:8,267 --> 0:19:10,27
Wow.


329
0:19:10,27 --> 0:19:14,347
Alan Johnson's Beamer.


330
0:19:14,347 --> 0:19:16,947
Alan... Johnson's...


331
0:19:16,947 --> 0:19:18,867
Beamer.


332
0:19:18,867 --> 0:19:20,907
Do you think he's going to mind?


333
0:19:20,907 --> 0:19:23,27
I think it's possible he might mind.


334
0:19:23,27 --> 0:19:32,707
If Mark can't drive, why did he...?


335
0:19:32,707 --> 0:19:35,867
- You've got to help me out here.
- Sure, mate. Sure.


336
0:19:35,867 --> 0:19:39,227
I'll tell Super Hans
that you'll be staying now.


337
0:19:39,227 --> 0:19:41,547
Look, Jez, you've got to take the rap.


338
0:19:41,547 --> 0:19:44,27
I mean, you don't have to, but...


339
0:19:44,27 --> 0:19:45,867
I have a future


340
0:19:45,867 --> 0:19:48,387
whereas you... not don't,


341
0:19:48,387 --> 0:19:52,187
- just, it's different...
- 'He's grasping at straws.


342
0:19:52,187 --> 0:19:54,587
'It's all over for him and Johnson.


343
0:19:54,587 --> 0:19:58,947
'Might as well get some brownie points
by acting "the big friend".'


344
0:19:58,947 --> 0:20:2,507
Sure, mate.
If you really, really want me to... mate,


345
0:20:2,507 --> 0:20:4,547
I'll do it. I'II...


346
0:20:4,547 --> 0:20:6,547
face the firing squad.


347
0:20:6,547 --> 0:20:9,747
- True mates.
- True mates.


348
0:20:9,747 --> 0:20:14,707
- Ehhh...
- Uhhh...


349
0:20:14,707 --> 0:20:16,987
Johnson is here! Johnson is here!


350
0:20:16,987 --> 0:20:20,427
You're such a good guy.


351
0:20:20,427 --> 0:20:23,547
'We'll be in Cardiff
within the fortnight.


352
0:20:23,547 --> 0:20:25,507
'Relax, Mark.


353
0:20:25,507 --> 0:20:30,267
- 'Business before pleasure. '
- Mark, I'm a little concerned.


354
0:20:30,267 --> 0:20:39,267
- My 5 Series isn't where I left it.
- Alan, come in.


355
0:20:39,267 --> 0:20:41,627
Something terrible has happened.


356
0:20:41,627 --> 0:20:46,987
- What's happened to my car?
- Yes, there's a bit of a problem there...


357
0:20:46,987 --> 0:20:51,267
You see, I borrowed the keys,
drove it around for a bit of a laugh


358
0:20:51,267 --> 0:20:56,187
- and then I crashed it.
- He says "borrowed", but I had no...


359
0:20:56,187 --> 0:20:59,667
- Blimey.
- Yes, "blimey".


360
0:20:59,667 --> 0:21:2,827
Hey-ho.
So, you got the Newport projections?


361
0:21:2,827 --> 0:21:4,947
What? Hold on. Aren't you...?


362
0:21:4,947 --> 0:21:7,827
The car. You trusted...
You gave the keys to...


363
0:21:7,827 --> 0:21:11,307
What? I'm insured out of my arse, mate.
I'm covered.


364
0:21:11,307 --> 0:21:13,667
So, sushi or cappuccino? I'm easy.


365
0:21:13,667 --> 0:21:15,787
'Shit, he doesn't care.


366
0:21:15,787 --> 0:21:20,467
'Mark's in the clear. It's going to be
me and Super Hans - forever. '


367
0:21:20,467 --> 0:21:22,347
No, don't go, because...


368
0:21:22,347 --> 0:21:26,947
Sorry, Mark. I just can't take
any more lies. He smashed up your car.


369
0:21:26,947 --> 0:21:30,467
He did it because he hates you, really.


370
0:21:30,467 --> 0:21:33,147
You really are a bitter loser, aren't you,


371
0:21:33,147 --> 0:21:36,907
Mr No Logo,
Mr Work A Day For World Peace?


372
0:21:36,907 --> 0:21:39,587
- Mark, shall we split?
- But you two...


373
0:21:39,587 --> 0:21:42,667
This is never gonna work!
You don't know him.


374
0:21:42,667 --> 0:21:45,107
You don't know how he likes his toast.


375
0:21:45,107 --> 0:21:49,187
In a business class seat
of a Virgin Atlantic flight to New York.


376
0:21:49,187 --> 0:21:54,107
Wrong! He likes one brown with Marmite
and one white with lime marmalade.


377
0:21:54,107 --> 0:21:57,947
- I'm so outta here.
- No, don't go. You can't because...


378
0:21:57,947 --> 0:22:1,747
The truth is he doesn't love you
for your business plan.


379
0:22:1,747 --> 0:22:5,707
He loves you for your...


380
0:22:5,707 --> 0:22:8,747
- He loves you for you.
- Jeremy, for God's sake!


381
0:22:8,747 --> 0:22:13,547
Mark's gay, Johnson. I can handle that.
I'm fine with that. Are you?


382
0:22:13,547 --> 0:22:15,587
Look... I'm a businessman.


383
0:22:15,587 --> 0:22:19,347
That's what I am. That's what I do.


384
0:22:19,347 --> 0:22:21,587
I don't want... this.


385
0:22:21,587 --> 0:22:24,107
I didn't come here for this.
Mark, you don't...


386
0:22:24,107 --> 0:22:26,507
- love me do you?
- Love you?!


387
0:22:26,507 --> 0:22:28,547
Of course not!


388
0:22:28,547 --> 0:22:31,27
No...


389
0:22:31,27 --> 0:22:34,827
Yes... yes, maybe a bit.
I do possibly somewhat.


390
0:22:34,827 --> 0:22:38,667
But... Alan, it's not how it seems.


391
0:22:38,667 --> 0:22:41,347
I'm 850/0 sure I'm straight.


392
0:22:41,347 --> 0:22:47,347
It's just... I do have feelings for you
and, in principle, I'm not against...


393
0:22:47,347 --> 0:22:49,107
more...


394
0:22:49,107 --> 0:22:52,747
I don't think I'll know
until it's right in front of me,


395
0:22:52,747 --> 0:22:55,987
whether I'll be able
to go through with it, OK?


396
0:22:55,987 --> 0:22:58,627
You love me, not the business?


397
0:22:58,627 --> 0:23:5,147
I just don't know any more!


398
0:23:5,147 --> 0:23:7,27
I think it's best if you go now.


399
0:23:7,27 --> 0:23:9,987
Yeah.


400
0:23:9,987 --> 0:23:13,587
'My name's Andrew. I'm 25 years old.
I'm a chef. '


401
0:23:13,587 --> 0:23:16,547
'Not this. I don't want this.
Not now.


402
0:23:16,547 --> 0:23:20,187
'I'm not gay.
Possibly bi, but basically uncurious. '


403
0:23:20,187 --> 0:23:26,107
'I love beauty, hate arrogance
and I love sucking cock. '


404
0:23:26,107 --> 0:23:28,627
The bad thing...


405
0:23:28,627 --> 0:23:38,507
That... was the bad thing.


406
0:23:38,507 --> 0:23:42,787
Right, my turn now.


407
0:23:42,787 --> 0:23:44,627
? Don't know why


408
0:23:44,627 --> 0:23:48,507
? You're so blue


409
0:23:48,507 --> 0:23:52,147
? The sun's gonna shine
on everything you do


410
0:23:52,147 --> 0:23:55,147
? And the sky


411
0:23:55,147 --> 0:23:59,147
? Is so blue


412
0:23:59,147 --> 0:25:59,147
? The sun's gonna shine
on everything you do?
