0:0:11,0 --> 0:0:12,51
RYAN DUFFY: So we're here in
Bolivar Square in the middle


3
0:0:12,51 --> 0:0:13,405
of central Caracas.


4
0:0:13,405 --> 0:0:16,17
As you might be able to tell
from the cathedral behind me,


5
0:0:16,17 --> 0:0:18,55
Venezuela is, like most Latin
American countries,


6
0:0:18,55 --> 0:0:19,98
predominantly Catholic.


7
0:0:19,98 --> 0:0:22,125
Now the interesting bit here is
there's a good bit of kind


8
0:0:22,125 --> 0:0:24,83
of Santeria and spiritism
in the mix as well.


9
0:0:24,83 --> 0:0:27,22
And we've recently found a
particular group of Saints


10
0:0:27,22 --> 0:0:28,21
that fascinates us.


11
0:0:28,21 --> 0:0:31,6
They're called the Santos
Malandros, translated roughly


12
0:0:31,6 --> 0:0:33,36
as the Holy Thugs.


13
0:0:33,36 --> 0:0:36,72
Now, it's either kind of perfect
or really troubling


14
0:0:36,72 --> 0:0:39,21
that in Caracas, widely regarded
as the world's most


15
0:0:39,21 --> 0:0:42,36
violent city, the Venezuelan
people are worshipping at the


16
0:0:42,36 --> 0:0:45,834
feet of tiny statues of now
dead armed criminals.


17
0:0:45,834 --> 0:0:57,21



18
0:0:57,21 --> 0:1:0,44
Over 14,000 people were killed
in Venezuela last year.


19
0:1:0,44 --> 0:1:2,7
And Caracas has the highest
murder rate per


20
0:1:2,7 --> 0:1:4,28
capita in the world.


21
0:1:4,28 --> 0:1:7,28
Hugo Chavez's Bolivarian
Revolution may have reduced


22
0:1:7,28 --> 0:1:10,39
poverty in this oil-rich
country, but he's yet to bring


23
0:1:10,39 --> 0:1:13,54
any sense of safety or security
to the streets.


24
0:1:13,54 --> 0:1:15,9
It's in the middle of all this
violence that the cult of the


25
0:1:15,9 --> 0:1:18,9
Holy Thugs was born.


26
0:1:18,9 --> 0:1:21,53
The Holy Thugs are part of a
very unique mix of Catholicism


27
0:1:21,53 --> 0:1:22,53
and spiritism.


28
0:1:22,53 --> 0:1:25,495
So we first visited with
sociologist Tulio Hernandez to


29
0:1:25,495 --> 0:1:28,15
try and get our heads
around it.

31
0:1:30,3 --> 0:2:0,53



32
0:2:0,53 --> 0:2:2,63
RYAN DUFFY: He explained that
the main goddess of Venezuela


33
0:2:2,63 --> 0:2:6,68
spiritism is Maria Lionza, who
is represented, of course, as


34
0:2:6,68 --> 0:2:10,12
a naked lady riding what looks
to be an anteater.


35
0:2:10,12 --> 0:2:15,86
Maria Lionza, essentially the
queen of all spirits.


36
0:2:15,86 --> 0:2:18,2
Below her there's a whole bunch
of other saints grouped


37
0:2:18,2 --> 0:2:19,1
into courts.


38
0:2:19,1 --> 0:2:22,62
There's the court of doctors,
of Indians, of Africans, of


39
0:2:22,62 --> 0:2:24,85
Vikings, and even of
revolutionaries.

41
0:2:26,1 --> 0:2:45,54

RYAN DUFFY: Every court
has a leader.


43
0:2:46,84 --> 0:2:49,25
And the leader of the Court de
Malandro or the Court of the


44
0:2:49,25 --> 0:2:52,16
Thugs is Ismael Sanchez.


45
0:2:52,16 --> 0:2:54,91
So it's mid-afternoon and we
just got to the cemetery here


46
0:2:54,91 --> 0:2:55,85
in Caracas.


47
0:2:55,85 --> 0:3:0,13
And right over here is where
Ishmael Sanchez is buried,


48
0:3:0,13 --> 0:3:3,47
along with the other members
of the Holy Thugs.


49
0:3:3,47 --> 0:3:5,54
And this is where everyone
comes to kind


50
0:3:5,54 --> 0:3:6,79
of pay their respects.

we met Omar, the unofficial


57

caretaker of Ismael's shrine,
and his buddies, Johann and


58
0:4:13,1 --> 0:4:15,15
Vamonde, who both seem
to be spiritism


59
0:4:15,15 --> 0:4:17,0

a lot about Ismael.


69
0:5:7,12 --> 0:5:11,9
There's, you know, another few
saints in similar fashion who


70
0:5:11,9 --> 0:5:13,33
are part of this group.


71
0:5:13,33 --> 0:5:14,91
Can you tell us about
some of the others?

we saw a funeral


90
0:7:41,59 --> 0:7:42,62
procession drive by.


91
0:7:42,62 --> 0:7:45,19
And we were told that it was a
kid murdered in the nearby


92
0:7:45,19 --> 0:7:46,79
slums that weekend.


93
0:7:46,79 --> 0:7:49,27
Soon after, we heard a few
rounds of automatic weapon


94
0:7:49,27 --> 0:7:51,492
fire and decided it
was time to leave.

98
0:8:6,52 --> 0:8:9,5
RYAN DUFFY: So leaving the
cemetery just now, we drove by


99
0:8:9,5 --> 0:8:11,41
this shop and noticed they have
a bunch of the Holy Thugs


100
0:8:11,41 --> 0:8:12,75
displayed in front.


101
0:8:12,75 --> 0:8:15,2
So we're going to pop in, and go
check them out, and see if


102
0:8:15,2 --> 0:8:16,59
we can meet the folks
who run the place.


103
0:8:16,59 --> 0:8:23,37



104
0:8:23,37 --> 0:8:25,97
We met the shop owner, a
spiritist named Clara, who


105
0:8:25,97 --> 0:8:28,78
said she could only talk to us
with Ismael's permission.


106
0:8:28,78 --> 0:8:31,662
So she went back to
her alter to ask.


107
0:8:31,662 --> 0:8:33,586
It's a boy Ismael.


108
0:8:33,586 --> 0:8:38,44
It's the leader the pack and the
rest of the pack as well.


109
0:8:38,44 --> 0:8:40,87
This is Antonio.


110
0:8:40,87 --> 0:8:42,97
He's got a pretty
serious scar.


111
0:8:42,97 --> 0:8:46,3
It's kind of right in
there above his eye.


112
0:8:46,3 --> 0:8:49,25
That's a knife fight that
Antonio got in.


113
0:8:49,25 --> 0:8:52,44
Fresh out of the Thunderbird.


114
0:8:52,44 --> 0:8:57,42
It's the one Holy Thug who
came from Jersey, Johnny.


115
0:8:57,42 --> 0:9:2,57
Domicito, that's
a serious dude.


116
0:9:2,57 --> 0:9:3,94
He also has the Nike hat.


117
0:9:3,94 --> 0:9:7,14



118
0:9:7,14 --> 0:9:10,61
He's perhaps a little more
devious than the rest.


119
0:9:10,61 --> 0:9:15,25
He's somewhat concealing
his weapon.


120
0:9:15,25 --> 0:9:18,27
Clara eventually invited us
back, where she actually


121
0:9:18,27 --> 0:9:21,9
offered to channel Ismael
himself for us.

Venezuelans, living in poverty

and amidst all of this violence,
believing in the


137
0:11:6,59 --> 0:11:9,45

is a bit more of a

more familiar and flawed
