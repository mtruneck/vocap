1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:10,48
[MUSIC PLAYING]


2
0:0:10,48 --> 0:0:12,3
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: We're in
Jamaica, an island known for


3
0:0:12,3 --> 0:0:14,87
its idyllic beaches and stunning
natural beauty.


4
0:0:14,87 --> 0:0:17,77
But we're here to find out about
something that frankly,


5
0:0:17,77 --> 0:0:20,39
most Jamaicans are uncomfortable
talking about.


6
0:0:20,39 --> 0:0:22,77
It's called Obeah, and it's an
Afro-Caribbean religion that


7
0:0:22,77 --> 0:0:25,1
has its roots in magic
and sorcery.


8
0:0:25,1 --> 0:0:27,65
My co-pilot for this trip is
Natalia from Colombia.


9
0:0:27,65 --> 0:0:28,75
NATALIA SANCHEZ: So
happy to be here.


10
0:0:28,75 --> 0:0:30,16
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU:
Good to see you.


11
0:0:30,16 --> 0:0:31,91
Natalia, tell me
about yourself.


12
0:0:31,91 --> 0:0:33,33
NATALIA SANCHEZ: Well,
I'm originally


13
0:0:33,33 --> 0:0:35,25
from Bogota, Colombia.


14
0:0:35,25 --> 0:0:38,33
I've been living in Amsterdam
for the past couple years.


15
0:0:38,33 --> 0:0:41,51
I work as a media researcher.


16
0:0:41,51 --> 0:0:44,69
I've been looking into
communication and


17
0:0:44,69 --> 0:0:47,42
representation of physical
suffering in different media.


18
0:0:47,42 --> 0:0:48,132
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So pain.


19
0:0:48,132 --> 0:0:50,13
NATALIA SANCHEZ: Pain
and suffering, yeah.


20
0:0:50,13 --> 0:0:50,77
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Oh, boy.


21
0:0:50,77 --> 0:0:53,2
NATALIA SANCHEZ: So why are
we looking into Obeah?


22
0:0:53,2 --> 0:0:56,55
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: OK, so Obeah
is an occult folk religion.


23
0:0:56,55 --> 0:0:58,52
And so it's kind of
like voodoo and


24
0:0:58,52 --> 0:0:59,96
Santeria, but it's different.


25
0:0:59,96 --> 0:1:1,74
There's something distinct
and Jamaican about it.


26
0:1:1,74 --> 0:1:4,92
There's good aspects of it and
then there's kind of evil


27
0:1:4,92 --> 0:1:5,98
aspects of it.


28
0:1:5,98 --> 0:1:7,45
People seem to take it
really seriously.


29
0:1:7,45 --> 0:1:10,9
I've read about an Obeah man who
was stoned to death by a


30
0:1:10,9 --> 0:1:13,92
mob because he was
allegedly casting


31
0:1:13,92 --> 0:1:15,39
curses upon the villagers.


32
0:1:15,39 --> 0:1:16,54
NATALIA SANCHEZ: That's awful.


33
0:1:16,54 --> 0:1:16,8
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah.


34
0:1:16,8 --> 0:1:18,46
Well, so people take it
really seriously.


35
0:1:18,46 --> 0:1:21,1
So we want to find out, why do
people feel threatened by it?


36
0:1:21,1 --> 0:1:23,11
What about it is good?


37
0:1:23,11 --> 0:1:24,24
What about it is evil?


38
0:1:24,24 --> 0:1:28,77
And how does it interface with
modern Jamaican culture?


39
0:1:28,77 --> 0:1:30,41
The first place we're going
to go is an occult


40
0:1:30,41 --> 0:1:31,71
shop, an Obeah shop.


41
0:1:31,71 --> 0:1:34,52
So it has sort of like the
materials and the things that


42
0:1:34,52 --> 0:1:37,33
you need for an Obeah man
to do rituals and stuff.


43
0:1:37,33 --> 0:1:38,3
NATALIA SANCHEZ: Sounds
exciting.


44
0:1:38,3 --> 0:1:39,26
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah,
well, honestly, I'm a


45
0:1:39,26 --> 0:1:40,22
little scared, you know?


46
0:1:40,22 --> 0:1:43,15
Like who knows what kind
of curses we'll get.


47
0:1:43,15 --> 0:1:44,4
Hopefully good ones.


48
0:1:44,4 --> 0:2:26,98



49
0:2:26,98 --> 0:2:28,1
NATALIA SANCHEZ: Look
at this, guys.


50
0:2:28,1 --> 0:2:29,17
The vagina candle.


51
0:2:29,17 --> 0:2:30,49
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: The
vagina candle.


52
0:2:30,49 --> 0:2:31,432
We found it.


53
0:2:31,432 --> 0:2:34,49
You like the vagina candle?


54
0:2:34,49 --> 0:2:35,825
What about those oils
over there?


55
0:2:35,825 --> 0:2:37,72
ONEIL MILES: They have
various oils for


56
0:2:37,72 --> 0:2:39,47
various different reasons.


57
0:2:39,47 --> 0:2:42,73
They have fast luck when people
think they are not


58
0:2:42,73 --> 0:2:46,11
lucky, and buy the fast luck if
they want to have holy man


59
0:2:46,11 --> 0:2:49,2
oil if a woman want her
man to come back.


60
0:2:49,2 --> 0:2:52,3
You have oils for almost
every reason.


61
0:2:52,3 --> 0:2:52,97
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: What do
you do with the oil?


62
0:2:52,97 --> 0:2:54,11
You just put it on your
body or do you--


63
0:2:54,11 --> 0:2:55,53
is there a ceremony?


64
0:2:55,53 --> 0:2:57,59
Like what is the process?


65
0:2:57,59 --> 0:2:58,7
ONEIL MILES: That's when you
go to the Obeah man.


66
0:2:58,7 --> 0:3:0,16
He'll give the instructions.


67
0:3:0,16 --> 0:3:1,73
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So you
go to the Obeah man.


68
0:3:1,73 --> 0:3:4,0
ONEIL MILES: Tell him your
problem, and with him giving


69
0:3:4,0 --> 0:3:6,35
you the solution, he'll give you
like a prescription, like


70
0:3:6,35 --> 0:3:7,4
with the drug--


71
0:3:7,4 --> 0:3:7,73
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Oh, so you're
like a drugstore.


72
0:3:7,73 --> 0:3:9,21
You're kind of like
a pharmacy.


73
0:3:9,21 --> 0:3:9,66
ONEIL MILES: Right.


74
0:3:9,66 --> 0:3:14,24
So we supply the material that's
on the prescription.


75
0:3:14,24 --> 0:3:14,45
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: I see.


76
0:3:14,45 --> 0:3:15,63
I see there's sprays up there.


77
0:3:15,63 --> 0:3:19,44
ONEIL MILES: There are sprays,
perfumes, holders, oils,


78
0:3:19,44 --> 0:3:24,4
incense, bath, candles, and
they go as far as you have


79
0:3:24,4 --> 0:3:29,216
amulets, lucky pendants, things
for moving pendants.


80
0:3:29,216 --> 0:3:29,59
OK.


81
0:3:29,59 --> 0:3:31,2
This is the Go Away Evil.


82
0:3:31,2 --> 0:3:32,91
For protection.


83
0:3:32,91 --> 0:3:34,56
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: What's the
most popular thing people buy?


84
0:3:34,56 --> 0:3:35,46
ONEIL MILES: You have the
fastest-selling one.


85
0:3:35,46 --> 0:3:36,672
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: This is
a fastest-selling one.


86
0:3:36,672 --> 0:3:37,516
ONEIL MILES: Right,
Go Away Evil.


87
0:3:37,516 --> 0:3:38,36
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: It
says Go Away Evil.


88
0:3:38,36 --> 0:3:39,44
NATALIA SANCHEZ: I can't
imagine that'd


89
0:3:39,44 --> 0:3:39,53
be the popular one.


90
0:3:39,53 --> 0:3:40,5
ONEIL MILES: And everybody
wants money, so money's


91
0:3:40,5 --> 0:3:41,79
another fast-selling one.


92
0:3:41,79 --> 0:3:44,39
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So you truly
believe that these things--


93
0:3:44,39 --> 0:3:45,5
ONEIL MILES: I believe.


94
0:3:45,5 --> 0:3:45,74
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: You believe.


95
0:3:45,74 --> 0:3:46,51
ONEIL MILES: If I believe?


96
0:3:46,51 --> 0:3:47,61
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, that's
what I'm asking.


97
0:3:47,61 --> 0:3:49,26
ONEIL MILES: Well, I mean, To
sell all these products, I


98
0:3:49,26 --> 0:3:53,9
have to believe in them, but
I've never actually tried it.


99
0:3:53,9 --> 0:3:54,23
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: You've
never tried it?


100
0:3:54,23 --> 0:3:56,24
ONEIL MILES: No, I'll spray it,
but as I said, it go with


101
0:3:56,24 --> 0:3:57,9
instructions.


102
0:3:57,9 --> 0:3:59,22
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Well, so can
you tell us where we can find


103
0:3:59,22 --> 0:4:2,49
a really good Obeah man so
we can try for ourselves?


104
0:4:2,49 --> 0:4:4,36
ONEIL MILES: Well, when you
leave here, you could go down


105
0:4:4,36 --> 0:4:7,54
by Walderston to meet Joseph.


106
0:4:7,54 --> 0:4:7,69
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Joseph.


107
0:4:7,69 --> 0:4:8,15
NATALIA SANCHEZ: OK.


108
0:4:8,15 --> 0:4:9,99
Let's go meet Joseph.


109
0:4:9,99 --> 0:4:10,45
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: All right.


110
0:4:10,45 --> 0:4:11,54
Let's do it.


111
0:4:11,54 --> 0:4:11,85
Thanks a lot.


112
0:4:11,85 --> 0:4:12,21
NATALIA SANCHEZ: Thank you.


113
0:4:12,21 --> 0:4:13,46
ONEIL MILES: You're welcome.


114
0:4:13,46 --> 0:4:17,82



115
0:4:17,82 --> 0:4:18,4
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: All
right, Natalia.


116
0:4:18,4 --> 0:4:21,86
It looks like we've driven up a
few hours into the interior


117
0:4:21,86 --> 0:4:22,89
of the island.


118
0:4:22,89 --> 0:4:23,88
NATALIA SANCHEZ: Let's
go find Joseph.


119
0:4:23,88 --> 0:4:25,282
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Maybe I'll
ask this guy over here.


120
0:4:25,282 --> 0:4:27,114
Excuse me, do you know
where Joseph is?


121
0:4:27,114 --> 0:4:28,62
MAN ON STREET: Joseph?


122
0:4:28,62 --> 0:4:28,536
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah.


123
0:4:28,536 --> 0:4:29,1
You know Joseph?


124
0:4:29,1 --> 0:4:30,432
The Obeah man?


125
0:4:30,432 --> 0:4:32,21
MAN ON STREET: Turn right
over here then--


126
0:4:32,21 --> 0:4:33,63
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Right around
the gate up there?


127
0:4:33,63 --> 0:4:33,89
Thanks, buddy.


128
0:4:33,89 --> 0:4:35,834
MAN ON STREET: [INAUDIBLE].


129
0:4:35,834 --> 0:4:36,806
NATALIA SANCHEZ: Thank you.


130
0:4:36,806 --> 0:4:38,264
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Thank
you to you, too.


131
0:4:38,264 --> 0:4:39,73
MAN ON STREET: Turn
right for Joseph.


132
0:4:39,73 --> 0:4:41,678
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: OK.


133
0:4:41,678 --> 0:4:42,8
All right.


134
0:4:42,8 --> 0:4:43,525
NATALIA SANCHEZ: So it seems
we're kind of close.


135
0:4:43,525 --> 0:4:43,98
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah.


136
0:4:43,98 --> 0:4:44,435
NATALIA SANCHEZ: OK.


137
0:4:44,435 --> 0:4:45,345
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: We're close.


138
0:4:45,345 --> 0:4:47,97
We just got to go the jerk
center, and that's where


139
0:4:47,97 --> 0:4:49,77
Joseph the Obeah man will be.


140
0:4:49,77 --> 0:4:51,9
Hey, are you Joseph?


141
0:4:51,9 --> 0:4:52,35
JOSEPH WALDER: Yes,
I'm Joseph.


142
0:4:52,35 --> 0:4:53,24
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Hey,
how you doing?


143
0:4:53,24 --> 0:4:53,5
NATALIA SANCHEZ: Hi.


144
0:4:53,5 --> 0:4:55,16
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So could you
take us to your place?


145
0:4:55,16 --> 0:4:56,3
JOSEPH WALDER: Yes,
I can [INAUDIBLE].


146
0:4:56,3 --> 0:4:56,8
You're welcome.


147
0:4:56,8 --> 0:4:57,225
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Down here?


148
0:4:57,225 --> 0:4:57,65
JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.


149
0:4:57,65 --> 0:4:58,5
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU:
OK, let's go.


150
0:4:58,5 --> 0:5:1,17
Joseph the Obeah man
was a handful.


151
0:5:1,17 --> 0:5:3,69
It was really difficult to sort
of discern one single


152
0:5:3,69 --> 0:5:6,59
straight line of his sort of
philosophy and practice and


153
0:5:6,59 --> 0:5:8,35
thinking, because he just
did everything.


154
0:5:8,35 --> 0:5:9,49
I have a really basic
question.


155
0:5:9,49 --> 0:5:11,86
Just what is Obeah?


156
0:5:11,86 --> 0:5:14,3
JOSEPH WALDER: Obeah is a thing
that-- it originated


157
0:5:14,3 --> 0:5:15,75
long time ago.


158
0:5:15,75 --> 0:5:21,27
And God gave man the privilege
to help themselves when they


159
0:5:21,27 --> 0:5:21,855
are in problems.


160
0:5:21,855 --> 0:5:23,19
[INAUDIBLE]


161
0:5:23,19 --> 0:5:27,18
choose different, different
race and creed.


162
0:5:27,18 --> 0:5:31,9
Like the Hebrew, no one can go
into the Ark of the Kabbalah


163
0:5:31,9 --> 0:5:34,8
and speak certain word and
it come to manifested.


164
0:5:34,8 --> 0:5:36,7
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So Obeah,
where did it come from?


165
0:5:36,7 --> 0:5:38,965
JOSEPH WALDER: Obeah
come from Africa.


166
0:5:38,965 --> 0:5:40,51
Obeah come from Africa.


167
0:5:40,51 --> 0:5:41,71
NATALIA SANCHEZ: What
kind of people come


168
0:5:41,71 --> 0:5:43,11
here looking for you?


169
0:5:43,11 --> 0:5:45,32
JOSEPH WALDER: People from
all walks of life.


170
0:5:45,32 --> 0:5:46,55
Doctors come here.


171
0:5:46,55 --> 0:5:47,11
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Really?


172
0:5:47,11 --> 0:5:48,53
JOSEPH WALDER: Police
come here.


173
0:5:48,53 --> 0:5:50,0
Soldiers come here.


174
0:5:50,0 --> 0:5:52,33
NATALIA SANCHEZ: Are you
scared to practice?


175
0:5:52,33 --> 0:5:55,9
I know that some Obeah
man has been--


176
0:5:55,9 --> 0:5:55,385
JOSEPH WALDER: Killed.


177
0:5:55,385 --> 0:5:56,49
NATALIA SANCHEZ: Have
been killed, yes.


178
0:5:56,49 --> 0:5:58,21
How do you feel about-- what
do you think about that?


179
0:5:58,21 --> 0:5:59,66
JOSEPH WALDER: Because they are
con artists and they take


180
0:5:59,66 --> 0:6:1,92
people money and they don't
complete the job.


181
0:6:1,92 --> 0:6:3,69
So they don't know what--
many of them out


182
0:6:3,69 --> 0:6:5,29
there are con artists.


183
0:6:5,29 --> 0:6:7,9
If you want to get genuine
science or help, you come to


184
0:6:7,9 --> 0:6:9,12
Jo-Jo, you will get it.


185
0:6:9,12 --> 0:6:9,83
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So you don't
think it's because they're


186
0:6:9,83 --> 0:6:11,46
scared of the black magic?


187
0:6:11,46 --> 0:6:13,13
NATALIA SANCHEZ: And because
they get, like--


188
0:6:13,13 --> 0:6:13,57
they're--


189
0:6:13,57 --> 0:6:15,6
they steal from people?


190
0:6:15,6 --> 0:6:16,41
JOSEPH WALDER: Yes, and some
of them kill people.


191
0:6:16,41 --> 0:6:18,92
Some people come-- for instance,
a man carried


192
0:6:18,92 --> 0:6:21,21
$500,000 and put it down there
and said Jo-Jo, me want to


193
0:6:21,21 --> 0:6:22,13
kill somebody.


194
0:6:22,13 --> 0:6:23,23
You know what I do to him?


195
0:6:23,23 --> 0:6:25,82
Said take your backside
and go out of place.


196
0:6:25,82 --> 0:6:28,6
But now I meet this nice
beautiful lady


197
0:6:28,6 --> 0:6:30,88
and I wanted her.


198
0:6:30,88 --> 0:6:33,27
Those Obeah man do something
to manipulate it


199
0:6:33,27 --> 0:6:34,976
for she to love you.


200
0:6:34,976 --> 0:6:35,442
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: OK.


201
0:6:35,442 --> 0:6:36,65
JOSEPH WALDER: But
I don't do that.


202
0:6:36,65 --> 0:6:38,8
I don't force anybody to love.


203
0:6:38,8 --> 0:6:39,89
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So you don't
do, like, vagina candle stuff,


204
0:6:39,89 --> 0:6:41,18
or penis candle?


205
0:6:41,18 --> 0:6:42,38
JOSEPH WALDER: No, no, no, no.


206
0:6:42,38 --> 0:6:45,116
I don't have to do-- this is
the vagina candle stuff and


207
0:6:45,116 --> 0:6:45,952
the penis stuff.


208
0:6:45,952 --> 0:6:46,99
I use herb to do that.


209
0:6:46,99 --> 0:6:47,67
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: OK.


210
0:6:47,67 --> 0:6:48,36
JOSEPH WALDER: I use herb.


211
0:6:48,36 --> 0:6:51,387
And I have this herb even-- many
people might not know I


212
0:6:51,387 --> 0:6:53,62
have thing that greater
than the doctor.


213
0:6:53,62 --> 0:6:54,2
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: You do?


214
0:6:54,2 --> 0:6:56,5
JOSEPH WALDER: Yes, I have thing
right in here that is


215
0:6:56,5 --> 0:6:57,63
greater than what the
doctor would use.


216
0:6:57,63 --> 0:6:59,302
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Have you
every seen a demon?


217
0:6:59,302 --> 0:7:0,266
JOSEPH WALDER: Of course.


218
0:7:0,266 --> 0:7:2,14
I have seen many demons.


219
0:7:2,14 --> 0:7:3,43
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: What
do they look like?


220
0:7:3,43 --> 0:7:5,56
JOSEPH WALDER: They are
ugly-looking creatures.


221
0:7:5,56 --> 0:7:7,22
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So wait, OK,
so you're saying, you see


222
0:7:7,22 --> 0:7:8,54
things that other people
can't see.


223
0:7:8,54 --> 0:7:10,14
JOSEPH WALDER: I see things what
other people cannot see.


224
0:7:10,14 --> 0:7:12,5
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: But then
how did the oils and


225
0:7:12,5 --> 0:7:12,97
your various remedies--


226
0:7:12,97 --> 0:7:13,94
JOSEPH WALDER: Yes,
that I use--


227
0:7:13,94 --> 0:7:15,68
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: How do those
two things go together?


228
0:7:15,68 --> 0:7:17,4
JOSEPH WALDER: Well,
I combinate it


229
0:7:17,4 --> 0:7:18,245
and I bless it up.


230
0:7:18,245 --> 0:7:21,53
Because you have to have books
with things to help people.


231
0:7:21,53 --> 0:7:23,53
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So you gotta
show us some, some ways to


232
0:7:23,53 --> 0:7:24,27
ward off evil.


233
0:7:24,27 --> 0:7:25,515
You have to show us
ways to get--


234
0:7:25,515 --> 0:7:25,713
JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.


235
0:7:25,713 --> 0:7:26,11
To ward off evil.


236
0:7:26,11 --> 0:7:27,69
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: I want to see
you in action, because if


237
0:7:27,69 --> 0:7:29,38
you're a superhero
against evil--


238
0:7:29,38 --> 0:7:29,87
JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.


239
0:7:29,87 --> 0:7:31,17
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Let's
see what you do.


240
0:7:31,17 --> 0:7:32,23
JOSEPH WALDER: Krishna,
Natalia.


241
0:7:32,23 --> 0:7:35,33
Krishna, Natalia.


242
0:7:35,33 --> 0:7:36,966
It's a goat eating a carrot.


243
0:7:36,966 --> 0:7:38,216
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: That's nice.


244
0:7:38,216 --> 0:7:40,482



245
0:7:40,482 --> 0:7:41,83
I see--


246
0:7:41,83 --> 0:7:42,34
I really--


247
0:7:42,34 --> 0:7:43,804
JOSEPH WALDER: Something
standing there.


248
0:7:43,804 --> 0:7:46,76
That is a spirit.


249
0:7:46,76 --> 0:7:47,16
NATALIA SANCHEZ: (QUIETLY)
I'm scared.


250
0:7:47,16 --> 0:7:49,45
JOSEPH WALDER: This one
is Eye of Isis.


251
0:7:49,45 --> 0:7:51,75
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Eye of Isis,
like from Egyptian stuff.


252
0:7:51,75 --> 0:7:51,93
JOSEPH WALDER: Yeah.


253
0:7:51,93 --> 0:7:52,62
Some.


254
0:7:52,62 --> 0:7:56,2
But I have to go back into
Egypt to get all my--


255
0:7:56,2 --> 0:7:57,41
I stay right here.


256
0:7:57,41 --> 0:7:59,15
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: You stay here,
but you go to Egypt.


257
0:7:59,15 --> 0:7:59,59
JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.


258
0:7:59,59 --> 0:8:0,382
I go there.


259
0:8:0,382 --> 0:8:1,11
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: That
sounds like a--


260
0:8:1,11 --> 0:8:2,85
JOSEPH WALDER: To get
information from books.


261
0:8:2,85 --> 0:8:4,135
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU:
From Egyptian--


262
0:8:4,135 --> 0:8:6,3
the Library of Alexandria.


263
0:8:6,3 --> 0:8:7,734
JOSEPH WALDER: I--I,
I read this book,


264
0:8:7,734 --> 0:8:8,63
The Book of the Dead.


265
0:8:8,63 --> 0:8:9,63
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Uh-huh.


266
0:8:9,63 --> 0:8:10,63
JOSEPH WALDER: Yeah, because--


267
0:8:10,63 --> 0:8:12,33
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, the
Egyptian Book of the Dead.


268
0:8:12,33 --> 0:8:13,3
JOSEPH WALDER: The Egyptian
Book of the Dead.


269
0:8:13,3 --> 0:8:14,56
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: I really
want to see something--


270
0:8:14,56 --> 0:8:15,62
yeah, I see something
standing there.


271
0:8:15,62 --> 0:8:17,73
JOSEPH WALDER: Right, that
is like a female


272
0:8:17,73 --> 0:8:19,22
carrot and a white hat.


273
0:8:19,22 --> 0:8:20,2
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: A white hat?


274
0:8:20,2 --> 0:8:20,5
JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.


275
0:8:20,5 --> 0:8:22,564
But there is a demon
behind that spirit.


276
0:8:22,564 --> 0:8:23,887
Look there.


277
0:8:23,887 --> 0:8:25,81
Look.


278
0:8:25,81 --> 0:8:28,78
See the person standing here?


279
0:8:28,78 --> 0:8:28,906
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Uh-huh.


280
0:8:28,906 --> 0:8:30,69
JOSEPH WALDER: Look
right here.


281
0:8:30,69 --> 0:8:32,0
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: And
there's the demon.


282
0:8:32,0 --> 0:8:33,24
JOSEPH WALDER: That's
the demon.


283
0:8:33,24 --> 0:8:33,97
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So what
does that mean?


284
0:8:33,97 --> 0:8:36,909
JOSEPH WALDER: You guys
gonna meet someone.


285
0:8:36,909 --> 0:8:37,97
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: OK.


286
0:8:37,97 --> 0:8:39,86
JOSEPH WALDER: Many things that
I see in the crystal is


287
0:8:39,86 --> 0:8:42,722
things to come.


288
0:8:42,722 --> 0:8:45,61
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Would you
come and anoint the car?


289
0:8:45,61 --> 0:8:46,7
JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.


290
0:8:46,7 --> 0:8:47,12
I'm going to anoint the car.


291
0:8:47,12 --> 0:8:47,55
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Awesome.


292
0:8:47,55 --> 0:8:48,9
JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.


293
0:8:48,9 --> 0:8:49,17
I'm going to anoint it.


294
0:8:49,17 --> 0:8:51,43
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: I'll open
up the hood for you.


295
0:8:51,43 --> 0:8:53,4
NATALIA SANCHEZ: So we're going
to have a safe trip.


296
0:8:53,4 --> 0:8:53,62
JOSEPH WALDER: Yes.


297
0:8:53,62 --> 0:8:55,882
I'm going to make you
have a safe trip.


298
0:8:55,882 --> 0:8:57,67
That's it.


299
0:8:57,67 --> 0:8:59,59
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: At the end of
the day, I think he thinks


300
0:8:59,59 --> 0:9:1,92
he's really helping people,
and like the people in his


301
0:9:1,92 --> 0:9:4,1
close circle seem to
think that he does


302
0:9:4,1 --> 0:9:5,28
good things for people.


303
0:9:5,28 --> 0:9:8,21
The very sort of scatter-shot
nature of his whole deal


304
0:9:8,21 --> 0:9:12,35
seemed like he was just try
to pull one over on us.


305
0:9:12,35 --> 0:9:14,81
Trying to find people to
actually talk to us on camera


306
0:9:14,81 --> 0:9:16,56
about Obeah has been
next to impossible.


307
0:9:16,56 --> 0:9:19,5
People will be like, yeah, go
down there, take your second


308
0:9:19,5 --> 0:9:22,8
left at the bridge, there's
woman there who practices.


309
0:9:22,8 --> 0:9:25,6
But as soon as you're asking
them to speak on the record,


310
0:9:25,6 --> 0:9:25,86
they shy up.


311
0:9:25,86 --> 0:9:28,16
And I think that's because it's
something you don't want


312
0:9:28,16 --> 0:9:28,67
to fuck with.


313
0:9:28,67 --> 0:9:31,86
We got a tip that there was an
Obeah woman who practiced


314
0:9:31,86 --> 0:9:33,34
pretty near where we were.


315
0:9:33,34 --> 0:9:35,616
You know, we took a couple
laps, went down into the


316
0:9:35,616 --> 0:9:37,56
interior, tried to find her.


317
0:9:37,56 --> 0:9:40,91
And she came down the stairs
from her house, and she was


318
0:9:40,91 --> 0:9:43,67
wearing like this
white head wrap.


319
0:9:43,67 --> 0:9:46,32
We asked her, like, are
you the Obeah woman?


320
0:9:46,32 --> 0:9:49,585
And she was totally offended
by that label.


321
0:9:49,585 --> 0:9:56,2



322
0:9:56,2 --> 0:9:57,825
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: And it
was like, oh, oh, man.


323
0:9:57,825 --> 0:10:0,11
Joseph, maybe your
shit is true.


324
0:10:0,11 --> 0:10:2,5
He had a vision, I guess,
in the crystal ball--


325
0:10:2,5 --> 0:10:3,85
a woman with a white hat on.


326
0:10:3,85 --> 0:10:8,19
But behind that woman was
a big, black demon.


327
0:10:8,19 --> 0:10:14,4
So I guess that's sort of like
the shadowy shit that's behind


328
0:10:14,4 --> 0:10:15,995
the sort of magic
and the healing.


329
0:10:15,995 --> 0:10:17,285
It's the demon behind.


330
0:10:17,285 --> 0:10:20,35



331
0:10:20,35 --> 0:10:24,11
That woman was unhappy to be
called an Obeah woman.


332
0:10:24,11 --> 0:10:25,98
I guess the stigma is,
like, that strong.


333
0:10:25,98 --> 0:10:26,94
NATALIA SANCHEZ: It
is really strong.


334
0:10:26,94 --> 0:10:31,5
You have really hard-core
real-life consequences.


335
0:10:31,5 --> 0:10:33,56
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: It sort of
like lurks just like a shadow


336
0:10:33,56 --> 0:10:34,65
over the whole practice.


337
0:10:34,65 --> 0:10:37,74
It's unspoken, but it exists.


338
0:10:37,74 --> 0:10:38,18
NATALIA SANCHEZ: Definitely.


339
0:10:38,18 --> 0:10:40,21
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: I tell you
what, Natalia, it's been such


340
0:10:40,21 --> 0:10:42,61
a distinct pleasure
having you join us


341
0:10:42,61 --> 0:10:44,2
for this last adventure.


342
0:10:44,2 --> 0:10:46,65
So I really wanted
to thank you.


343
0:10:46,65 --> 0:10:47,23
Thanks for being such
a good sport.


344
0:10:47,23 --> 0:10:48,65
NATALIA SANCHEZ:
It was amazing.


345
0:10:48,65 --> 0:10:51,76
I got to see a side of Jamaica
I would have never seen


346
0:10:51,76 --> 0:10:53,48
otherwise, so thank you.


347
0:10:53,48 --> 0:12:53,48
