0:0:0,95 --> 0:0:2,4
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN):
Hi, I'm Baby Balls.


3
0:0:2,4 --> 0:0:4,23
My bosses think I'm a nerd, so
they like to send me to live


4
0:0:4,23 --> 0:0:5,47
with different people
to figure out


5
0:0:5,47 --> 0:0:7,93
what they're all about.


6
0:0:7,93 --> 0:0:9,17
Anyway this is that.


7
0:0:9,17 --> 0:0:10,818
It's called Balls Deep.


8
0:0:10,818 --> 0:0:12,794
ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN): How's
everybody doing?

0:0:12,794 --> 0:0:15,264
[CROWD CHEERS]


10
0:0:15,264 --> 0:0:16,746
ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN): Everybody
get to your seats.


11
0:0:16,746 --> 0:0:20,21
It's time now for [INAUDIBLE]
fight night nine.


12
0:0:20,21 --> 0:0:22,222
THOMAS MARTIN: Hi, I'm Thomas
Martin, with VBS, and we're


13
0:0:22,222 --> 0:0:25,68
going go meet up with Matt
Ruskin who is a mixed martial


14
0:0:25,68 --> 0:0:28,62
arts fighter who's training
for a big cage


15
0:0:28,62 --> 0:0:30,91
match down in Georgia.


16
0:0:30,91 --> 0:0:32,84
We're going to follow him
through his routine and see if


17
0:0:32,84 --> 0:0:35,3
I can keep up, try not to get
my ass kicked and then go


18
0:0:35,3 --> 0:0:37,54
enjoy a fight.


19
0:0:37,54 --> 0:0:40,96
Mixed martial arts, or MMA, is
the official name of what's


20
0:0:40,96 --> 0:0:42,71
usually called Ultimate
Fighting.


21
0:0:42,71 --> 0:0:44,85
There's a small set of rules
to keep anyone from getting


22
0:0:44,85 --> 0:0:47,8
killed, like you can't gouge his
eyes out or attack their


23
0:0:47,8 --> 0:0:51,441
groin, but otherwise it's just
two guys in shorts whaling on


24
0:0:51,441 --> 0:0:53,98
each other until one is knocked
out or gives up.


25
0:0:53,98 --> 0:0:56,54
It's basically the closest
sports come to an actual


26
0:0:56,54 --> 0:0:58,12
street brawl.


27
0:0:58,12 --> 0:0:59,41
MMA has grown into one
of the most popular


28
0:0:59,41 --> 0:1:0,94
new sports in America.


29
0:1:0,94 --> 0:1:2,77
Matt is a relative newcomer
to the sport.


30
0:1:2,77 --> 0:1:4,569
He's got a few matches under
his belt but is still


31
0:1:4,569 --> 0:1:6,53
struggling to make a
name for himself.


32
0:1:6,53 --> 0:1:9,95
We're here in midtown Manhattan
at the Gracie


33
0:1:9,95 --> 0:1:12,74
Academy and we're going to
go meet up with Matt.


34
0:1:12,74 --> 0:1:13,985
Do we need to take
off our shoes?


35
0:1:13,985 --> 0:1:14,7
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Yeah.


36
0:1:14,7 --> 0:1:16,58
THOMAS MARTIN: I kind of wish I
didn't wear my fucking like


37
0:1:16,58 --> 0:1:18,87
candy land fucking socks.


38
0:1:18,87 --> 0:1:20,69
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You're
going to train too.


39
0:1:20,69 --> 0:1:21,612
ROB: You're what?


40
0:1:21,612 --> 0:1:23,6
THOMAS MARTIN: I'm
going to train--


41
0:1:23,6 --> 0:1:25,8
ROB: Those are the prettiest
socks on a man I've ever seen.


42
0:1:25,8 --> 0:1:27,691
I don't think I want to train
with you with those cute


43
0:1:27,691 --> 0:1:28,22
little socks.


44
0:1:28,22 --> 0:1:29,12
[LAUGHTER]


45
0:1:29,12 --> 0:1:31,23
ROB: I might just want to
snuggle up on the mat with you


46
0:1:31,23 --> 0:1:32,91
and hold you real tight.


47
0:1:32,91 --> 0:1:34,71
Cute little thing, you.


48
0:1:34,71 --> 0:1:35,66
MALE SPEAKER: Come on, let's
go get changed up.


49
0:1:35,66 --> 0:1:39,6
Grab your stuff.


50
0:1:39,6 --> 0:1:41,45
THOMAS MARTIN: In the pro
leagues like the UFC and IFL,


51
0:1:41,45 --> 0:1:43,59
the winnings can get up to
hundreds of thousands of


52
0:1:43,59 --> 0:1:46,65
dollars, but where Matt is at
right now, all his time and


53
0:1:46,65 --> 0:1:48,64
money go into his training.


54
0:1:48,64 --> 0:1:50,57
If he wins this fight
he stands to


55
0:1:50,57 --> 0:1:52,57
pocket a whopping $300.


56
0:1:52,57 --> 0:1:54,37
MATT RUSKIN: I weigh in
four weeks from today.


57
0:1:54,37 --> 0:1:56,97
Fight night is four weeks from
tommorow, and I have until


58
0:1:56,97 --> 0:2:0,27
right before I step in
that cage to be 171.


59
0:2:0,27 --> 0:2:1,44
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): The
weight class system is like


60
0:2:1,44 --> 0:2:3,14
institutionalized cheating.


61
0:2:3,14 --> 0:2:5,11
It's supposed to prevent
unfair matches but what


62
0:2:5,11 --> 0:2:8,9
happens is the bigger dudes just
starve themselves down to


63
0:2:8,9 --> 0:2:10,259
the lowest class they can, then
put all the weight back


64
0:2:10,259 --> 0:2:11,47
on the day of the fight.


65
0:2:11,47 --> 0:2:15,15
MATT RUSKIN: Right now we're
at right below 187.


66
0:2:15,15 --> 0:2:19,185
So we got about 16
pounds to go.


67
0:2:19,185 --> 0:2:21,33
THOMAS MARTIN: How often do you
do the Jiu-jitsu versus


68
0:2:21,33 --> 0:2:22,29
everything else?


69
0:2:22,29 --> 0:2:24,13
MATT RUSKIN: Try to even
everything out about two, two


70
0:2:24,13 --> 0:2:25,725
three days a week for
boxing, two to


71
0:2:25,725 --> 0:2:27,18
three days a week Jiu-jitsu.


72
0:2:27,18 --> 0:2:29,23
MMA is, is mixture of games.


73
0:2:29,23 --> 0:2:32,21
If you're a submission grappler
then obviously your,


74
0:2:32,21 --> 0:2:33,652
your goal is to get
the fight to the


75
0:2:33,652 --> 0:2:35,14
floor as quick as possible.


76
0:2:35,14 --> 0:2:37,903
Or if you're more of a striker
you know, you want to, to keep


77
0:2:37,903 --> 0:2:39,33
the fight standing up.


78
0:2:39,33 --> 0:2:41,59
I'm more a ground and pound.


79
0:2:41,59 --> 0:2:43,997
My submissions aren't that great
but if I get you on the


80
0:2:43,997 --> 0:2:46,2
ground hold a position and
just start blasting--


81
0:2:46,2 --> 0:2:47,504
THOMAS MARTIN: That's
a good technique.


82
0:2:47,504 --> 0:2:47,986
MATT RUSKIN: Yeah.


83
0:2:47,986 --> 0:2:49,673
THOMAS MARTIN: It's like a,
like a traditional school


84
0:2:49,673 --> 0:2:50,396
fighting technique.


85
0:2:50,396 --> 0:2:52,806
MATT RUSKIN: Uh-huh.


86
0:2:52,806 --> 0:2:55,5
CARL: The position that Julio
is in on the bottom


87
0:2:55,5 --> 0:2:56,23
is called the guard.


88
0:2:56,23 --> 0:2:58,74
He's still in kind of
neutral position.


89
0:2:58,74 --> 0:3:1,78
The man on the top is trying
to get past his legs so he


90
0:3:1,78 --> 0:3:3,42
gets more of a dominant
position.


91
0:3:3,42 --> 0:3:6,255
If you feel pain or if you feel
like you're going to pass


92
0:3:6,255 --> 0:3:7,38
out from a choke--


93
0:3:7,38 --> 0:3:7,83
[TAPS THE MAT]


94
0:3:7,83 --> 0:3:8,73
just do that.


95
0:3:8,73 --> 0:3:9,75
That means--


96
0:3:9,75 --> 0:3:11,476
It's kind of like
saying uncle.


97
0:3:11,476 --> 0:3:12,715
We'll just go from here.


98
0:3:12,715 --> 0:3:15,809
We'll just roll and try to make
each other say uncle.


99
0:3:15,809 --> 0:3:18,647
THOMAS MARTIN: I have no
idea what I'm doing.


100
0:3:18,647 --> 0:3:22,44
[GRUNTS IN PAIN]


101
0:3:22,44 --> 0:3:25,87
CARL: If you pain just tap.


102
0:3:25,87 --> 0:3:27,58
THOMAS MARTIN: Despite looking
like two dudes humping on a


103
0:3:27,58 --> 0:3:29,835
mat, Jiu-Jitsu is really
mentally involved.


104
0:3:29,835 --> 0:3:33,22
You have to remain fully aware
of what each of you limbs and


105
0:3:33,22 --> 0:3:36,17
each of your opponent's limbs
are doing at all times while


106
0:3:36,17 --> 0:3:38,517
planning what they're all going
to be doing five moves


107
0:3:38,517 --> 0:3:40,36
down the road.


108
0:3:40,36 --> 0:3:41,34
Ow!

0:3:41,34 --> 0:3:41,72
[INAUDIBLE]


110
0:3:41,72 --> 0:3:42,49
CARL: You alright?


111
0:3:42,49 --> 0:3:43,26
THOMAS MARTIN: Yeah.


112
0:3:43,26 --> 0:3:45,935
It's not about having like holds
or anything like, in


113
0:3:45,935 --> 0:3:47,63
like wrestling whatever,
it's like--


114
0:3:47,63 --> 0:3:47,965
CARL: Oh, there are about--


115
0:3:47,965 --> 0:3:49,318
THOMAS MARTIN: It's like pain.


116
0:3:49,318 --> 0:3:50,845
CARL: Litterally, the
idea is that it


117
0:3:50,845 --> 0:3:52,37
will destroy the joint.


118
0:3:52,37 --> 0:3:53,51
THOMAS MARTIN: Uh-huh.


119
0:3:53,51 --> 0:3:56,0
CARL: Right here is pressure
on the joint.


120
0:3:56,0 --> 0:4:0,1
If you don't give up I'm going
to probably pop the capsule on


121
0:4:0,1 --> 0:4:1,471
your elbow.


122
0:4:1,471 --> 0:4:3,13
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN):
Do all MMA fights end


123
0:4:3,13 --> 0:4:4,236
with a knock out?


124
0:4:4,236 --> 0:4:7,6
MATT RUSKIN: Knock out,
submission, verbal submission,


125
0:4:7,6 --> 0:4:8,446
versus a tap out--


126
0:4:8,446 --> 0:4:8,91
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN):
Yeah, OK.


127
0:4:8,91 --> 0:4:10,64
MATT RUSKIN: The referee
can stop it.


128
0:4:10,64 --> 0:4:13,352
In case somebody is getting too
much punishment they can


129
0:4:13,352 --> 0:4:15,72
directly step in and
end the fight.


130
0:4:15,72 --> 0:4:17,836
If you get a cut over the eye
and blood is pouring into your


131
0:4:17,836 --> 0:4:20,902
face, you can't see, they're
going to, they're


132
0:4:20,902 --> 0:4:21,835
going to stop it.


133
0:4:21,835 --> 0:4:23,45
The other way to win
is by decision.


134
0:4:23,45 --> 0:4:25,855
Let's say it goes three rounds
and it goes to the judges and


135
0:4:25,855 --> 0:4:29,89
they score, score a decision.


136
0:4:29,89 --> 0:4:30,52
MALE SPEAKER: He's doing fine.


137
0:4:30,52 --> 0:4:33,295
I mean he could be ready
in four weeks I think.


138
0:4:33,295 --> 0:4:33,78
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.


139
0:4:33,78 --> 0:4:34,27
THOMAS MARTIN: Thanks
again man.


140
0:4:34,27 --> 0:4:34,71

THOMAS MARTIN: No,
it's not working.


151
0:4:46,76 --> 0:4:48,28
ROB: Man, I've got shoes
bigger than you.


152
0:4:48,28 --> 0:4:51,1
You better get the
fuck off me man.


153
0:4:51,1 --> 0:4:54,24
MATT RUSKIN: Right now we are
on Saint Mark's Boulevard in


154
0:4:54,24 --> 0:4:58,22
Staten Island and we're heading
back to my house.


155
0:4:58,22 --> 0:5:1,24
I'm going to drop my stuff off
and then start running.


156
0:5:1,24 --> 0:5:4,83



157
0:5:4,83 --> 0:5:5,65
It's like a locker room.


158
0:5:5,65 --> 0:5:7,542
It serves the purpose.


159
0:5:7,542 --> 0:5:9,35
THOMAS MARTIN: Got a
nice little mantle.


160
0:5:9,35 --> 0:5:13,24
MATT RUSKIN: Vitamins, laundry,
vitamins, Jack


161
0:5:13,24 --> 0:5:14,81
Daniels, supplements.


162
0:5:14,81 --> 0:5:16,83
THOMAS MARTIN: Gamma O?


163
0:5:16,83 --> 0:5:19,33
MATT RUSKIN: It's a testosterone
booster.


164
0:5:19,33 --> 0:5:21,65
It heals your body a lot quicker
so we can keep the


165
0:5:21,65 --> 0:5:23,87
intensity of the workouts up.


166
0:5:23,87 --> 0:5:25,936
Without that stuff, or without
any kind of supplements you


167
0:5:25,936 --> 0:5:28,86
have to take obviously, like,
days off to recover from a


168
0:5:28,86 --> 0:5:31,82
really, really, intense
workout.


169
0:5:31,82 --> 0:5:34,63
This is the best invention
ever for somebody that is


170
0:5:34,63 --> 0:5:35,95
trying to diet and cut weight.


171
0:5:35,95 --> 0:5:37,2
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN):
Eating is the biggest part of


172
0:5:37,2 --> 0:5:37,83
the training.


173
0:5:37,83 --> 0:5:38,67
MATT RUSKIN: This is
what it makes.


174
0:5:38,67 --> 0:5:39,76
THOMAS MARTIN: Aw sweet.


175
0:5:39,76 --> 0:5:40,91
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN):
You're basically on the South


176
0:5:40,91 --> 0:5:44,6
Beach diet for a month while
spending all your energy


177
0:5:44,6 --> 0:5:45,55
working out every day.


178
0:5:45,55 --> 0:5:47,91
It makes you constantly pissed
off, which is good for the


179
0:5:47,91 --> 0:5:50,15
fight, but not so awesome for
hanging out with buds or


180
0:5:50,15 --> 0:5:51,45
trying to keep a girlfriend.


181
0:5:51,45 --> 0:5:53,126
MATT RUSKIN: When I'm not
cutting weight I mean I'll,


182
0:5:53,126 --> 0:5:55,14
I'll eat a lot more
obvious than this.


183
0:5:55,14 --> 0:5:57,9
THOMAS MARTIN: Well what do
you normally do on like a


184
0:5:57,9 --> 0:5:57,58
night like this?


185
0:5:57,58 --> 0:5:58,715
Just come back and--


186
0:5:58,715 --> 0:6:1,102
MATT RUSKIN: A night like
this I'll come back.


187
0:6:1,102 --> 0:6:6,6
I usually cook Tuesdays and
Thursdays, I do some sprints.


188
0:6:6,6 --> 0:6:9,6
Usually every night before I go
to bed is usually on phone.


189
0:6:9,6 --> 0:6:11,9
Talk to my girlfriend
for a few hours.


190
0:6:11,9 --> 0:6:13,38
And I just tell her about the
day and everything, and


191
0:6:13,38 --> 0:6:14,96
that's about it.


192
0:6:14,96 --> 0:6:18,53
Wake up do it all
again tommorow.


193
0:6:18,53 --> 0:6:19,78
Yeah, he's going to come
around with me.


194
0:6:19,78 --> 0:6:22,39



195
0:6:22,39 --> 0:6:26,166
Alright, I'm about to give
him a goo energy gell.

0:6:33,41 --> 0:6:33,78
THOMAS MARTIN: Here we go.


202
0:6:33,78 --> 0:6:34,15
Cheers!


203
0:6:34,15 --> 0:6:37,424
Oh, just take it all down?


204
0:6:37,424 --> 0:6:39,268
It's like frosting.


205
0:6:39,268 --> 0:6:42,8
Let's get ramp up and go
fucking sprinting.


206
0:6:42,8 --> 0:6:45,62
I don't have to go do this in a
rubber, rubber suit like the


207
0:6:45,62 --> 0:6:46,29
one you're wearing.


208
0:6:46,29 --> 0:6:49,27
MATT RUSKIN: No, this is just
good to get used to running in


209
0:6:49,27 --> 0:6:51,51
this getting, getting
a good sweat going.


210
0:6:51,51 --> 0:6:52,355
Ready?


211
0:6:52,355 --> 0:6:52,61
THOMAS MARTIN: Yep.


212
0:6:52,61 --> 0:6:53,86
Alright, we're just going?


213
0:6:53,86 --> 0:6:56,41



214
0:6:56,41 --> 0:6:58,17
Do you do running
punches ever?


215
0:6:58,17 --> 0:6:59,86
Or is that a no?


216
0:6:59,86 --> 0:7:1,375
That's just for showboaters?


217
0:7:1,375 --> 0:7:3,175
MATT RUSKIN: What we're going
for now is recovery time.


218
0:7:3,175 --> 0:7:6,58
What we're looking for is the
time it takes to go from


219
0:7:6,58 --> 0:7:8,26
sprinting a hundred yards
to jogging when you're


220
0:7:8,26 --> 0:7:10,3
[PANTS HEAVILY]


221
0:7:10,3 --> 0:7:10,81
to [BREATHES CALMLY]


222
0:7:10,81 --> 0:7:11,8
THOMAS MARTIN: Back to--


223
0:7:11,8 --> 0:7:12,9
MATT RUSKIN: Back to normal
breathing patterns, that's


224
0:7:12,9 --> 0:7:14,34
your recovery time.


225
0:7:14,34 --> 0:7:15,795
Once that time drops like--


226
0:7:15,795 --> 0:7:19,42
You can recover in like maybe 10
seconds five seconds, then


227
0:7:19,42 --> 0:7:20,344
you're in shape.


228
0:7:20,344 --> 0:7:21,332
THOMAS MARTIN: Alright.


229
0:7:21,332 --> 0:7:24,296
Fuck!


230
0:7:24,296 --> 0:7:25,778
He's long gone.


231
0:7:25,778 --> 0:7:34,18



232
0:7:34,18 --> 0:7:36,43
So it's going to go up, this
is just the first week?


233
0:7:36,43 --> 0:7:39,941
Yeah, by uh next week we're
going to do two, and if you


234
0:7:39,941 --> 0:7:43,102
can do four five minute
rounds of sprints


235
0:7:43,102 --> 0:7:43,955
you're in good shape.


236
0:7:43,955 --> 0:7:45,248
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN):
You can fight a man?


237
0:7:45,248 --> 0:7:45,712
MATT RUSKIN: Yeah.


238
0:7:45,712 --> 0:7:46,962
MATT RUSKIN: Alright.


239
0:7:46,962 --> 0:7:49,43



240
0:7:49,43 --> 0:7:53,12
Today w'ere down in Dumbo down
by the Brooklyn Bridge at


241
0:7:53,12 --> 0:7:55,95
Gleason's gym we're going to
go to, uh, Matt Ruskin's


242
0:7:55,95 --> 0:7:57,31
boxing training.


243
0:7:57,31 --> 0:7:59,57
It's been a few days since
I did the, the


244
0:7:59,57 --> 0:8:0,75
sprints with math.


245
0:8:0,75 --> 0:8:3,73
I've been trying to just keep up
some sort of health regimen


246
0:8:3,73 --> 0:8:7,87
versus my usual lying on
the couch at tonight.


247
0:8:7,87 --> 0:8:11,42
This is kind of an old, old
school traditional boxing gym.


248
0:8:11,42 --> 0:8:15,18
Matt described it to me as a
prison yard up there, so I was


249
0:8:15,18 --> 0:8:18,61
careful not to wear like
rainbow colored socks.


250
0:8:18,61 --> 0:8:20,29
Hey Matt how are you?


251
0:8:20,29 --> 0:8:20,975
MATT RUSKIN: Thomas
this is Mike.


252
0:8:20,975 --> 0:8:22,394
MIKE SMITH: How are
you doing Mike?


253
0:8:22,394 --> 0:8:23,34
THOMAS MARTIN: Alright.


254
0:8:23,34 --> 0:8:24,77
MIKE SMITH: You see the bell?


255
0:8:24,77 --> 0:8:25,52
THOMAS MARTIN: No.


256
0:8:25,52 --> 0:8:26,215
MIKE SMITH: You see
the bell up there.


257
0:8:26,215 --> 0:8:26,48
THOMAS MARTIN: Yeah.


258
0:8:26,48 --> 0:8:27,53
MIKE SMITH: It's like
the red light, green


259
0:8:27,53 --> 0:8:29,34
light, the yellow light.


260
0:8:29,34 --> 0:8:31,53
Red light means rest, green
light means go.


261
0:8:31,53 --> 0:8:35,12
[BUZZER SOUNDS]


262
0:8:35,12 --> 0:8:36,48
THOMAS MARTIN: Ah fuck.


263
0:8:36,48 --> 0:8:37,57
MATT RUSKIN: Don't jump
way up in the air.


264
0:8:37,57 --> 0:8:39,584
Just allow enough room
to for the rope to


265
0:8:39,584 --> 0:8:40,834
move under your feet.


266
0:8:40,834 --> 0:8:43,874



267
0:8:43,874 --> 0:8:46,349
THOMAS MARTIN: There we go.


268
0:8:46,349 --> 0:8:47,834
MATT RUSKIN: See you're
not too bad.


269
0:8:47,834 --> 0:8:48,329
THOMAS MARTIN: Oh!


270
0:8:48,329 --> 0:8:50,21
MIKE SMITH: Stop anybody in
the gym, I've got an open


271
0:8:50,21 --> 0:8:51,794
challenge to anybody
in the gym.


272
0:8:51,794 --> 0:8:52,784
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I'll
fight him right now!


273
0:8:52,784 --> 0:8:54,269
MIKE SMITH: This guy right
here [INAUDIBLE]


274
0:8:54,269 --> 0:8:56,75
anybody, open challenge.


275
0:8:56,75 --> 0:8:59,455
We've been training Matt for a
while for the stand up, for


276
0:8:59,455 --> 0:9:2,1
the stand up portion, there's
a boxing portion.


277
0:9:2,1 --> 0:9:2,45
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN):
Uh-huh.


278
0:9:2,45 --> 0:9:4,26
MIKE SMITH: You know, try to
tighten up his hands, because


279
0:9:4,26 --> 0:9:6,86
MMA you have to know a little
bit of everything.


280
0:9:6,86 --> 0:9:9,9
Now I got a little Jiu-Jitsu,
good wrestler, decent boxer.


281
0:9:9,9 --> 0:9:14,5
That's what makes this sport so
interesting and uh, hard,


282
0:9:14,5 --> 0:9:15,3
because you got to know a little
bit of everything.


283
0:9:15,3 --> 0:9:18,73



284
0:9:18,73 --> 0:9:19,67
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): Mike
is going to be the guy in


285
0:9:19,67 --> 0:9:22,1
Matt's corner for this match.


286
0:9:22,1 --> 0:9:23,93
He'll be the one mopping up his
sweat and blood between


287
0:9:23,93 --> 0:9:28,77
rounds and whispering strategies
into his ear like


288
0:9:28,77 --> 0:9:30,795
fuck him up good and hit
him in the face.


289
0:9:30,795 --> 0:9:37,14



290
0:9:37,14 --> 0:9:38,94
Boxing is a really good
time I liked it a


291
0:9:38,94 --> 0:9:39,68
lot more than jujitsu.


292
0:9:39,68 --> 0:9:42,67
It felt like real fighting
rather than some sort of weird


293
0:9:42,67 --> 0:9:44,27
body chess.


294
0:9:44,27 --> 0:9:47,48
I suppose that makes me more of
a striker than a floor man.


295
0:9:47,48 --> 0:9:50,3
All the accounting grunting and
sweating totally cranks up


296
0:9:50,3 --> 0:9:52,48
your testosterone I was started
getting pumped up to


297
0:9:52,48 --> 0:9:54,59
kick some ass, which I guess
is how Matt must


298
0:9:54,59 --> 0:9:56,43
feel all the time.


299
0:9:56,43 --> 0:9:58,992
MATT RUSKIN: The weight, the
weight is slowly coming off.


300
0:9:58,992 --> 0:10:0,956
THOMAS MARTIN: So what are
you what are you at?


301
0:10:0,956 --> 0:10:2,92
MATT RUSKIN: Right
now, about 184.


302
0:10:2,92 --> 0:10:3,411
THOMAS MARTIN: Is that good?


303
0:10:3,411 --> 0:10:4,393
Are you on track?


304
0:10:4,393 --> 0:10:5,375
MATT RUSKIN: We're on track.


305
0:10:5,375 --> 0:10:6,625
I'm exhausted.


306
0:10:6,625 --> 0:10:13,722



307
0:10:13,722 --> 0:10:15,14
THOMAS MARTIN: What have
you got qued up?


308
0:10:15,14 --> 0:10:15,56
This is you?


309
0:10:15,56 --> 0:10:17,4
MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN): This
is the video from, from the


310
0:10:17,4 --> 0:10:17,732
last fight.


311
0:10:17,732 --> 0:10:20,65
I mean, you're walking into a
cage and they're going to lock


312
0:10:20,65 --> 0:10:23,71
the door and it's going to be
you and some other guy trying


313
0:10:23,71 --> 0:10:27,44
to kill each other for the next
potentially 12 minutes.


314
0:10:27,44 --> 0:10:29,9
It didn't really know what
to expect of this kid.


315
0:10:29,9 --> 0:10:32,192
He came out pretty aggressive,
I was like fuck it, take him


316
0:10:32,192 --> 0:10:34,0
down where I feel comfortable.


317
0:10:34,0 --> 0:10:35,85
He was clamped on their
pretty good.


318
0:10:35,85 --> 0:10:38,13
And this is where I raise up.


319
0:10:38,13 --> 0:10:38,612
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN):
[INAUDIBLE]


320
0:10:38,612 --> 0:10:39,94
MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN):
Boom, Boom!


321
0:10:39,94 --> 0:10:40,54
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN):
Ooooh!


322
0:10:40,54 --> 0:10:42,5
MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN):
Three clean shots


323
0:10:42,5 --> 0:10:42,41
landed to the face.


324
0:10:42,41 --> 0:10:44,88
I think one of those knocked
his tooth lose.


325
0:10:44,88 --> 0:10:47,717
Gave him some him some
more hard shots.


326
0:10:47,717 --> 0:10:50,62
[LAUGHS]


327
0:10:50,62 --> 0:10:51,94
MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN):
Yeah I guess that--


328
0:10:51,94 --> 0:10:56,6
There you get the
tap and over.


329
0:10:56,6 --> 0:10:57,71
That was a good win.


330
0:10:57,71 --> 0:11:0,3
Best feeling in the world.


331
0:11:0,3 --> 0:11:1,64
MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN):
MMA emerged in the US


332
0:11:1,64 --> 0:11:2,87
in the early '90s.


333
0:11:2,87 --> 0:11:5,49
Originally the idea was to pair
up different schools of


334
0:11:5,49 --> 0:11:7,1
fighting to see which
was the best.


335
0:11:7,1 --> 0:11:10,56
Like, who would win between
a boxer and a karate guy.


336
0:11:10,56 --> 0:11:13,37
Over time, as folks figured out
what moves did and didn't


337
0:11:13,37 --> 0:11:16,17
work, a uniform fighting
style developed.


338
0:11:16,17 --> 0:11:18,8
Since the early days MMA has
been plagued by controversy


339
0:11:18,8 --> 0:11:20,82
over its supposed brutality.


340
0:11:20,82 --> 0:11:22,48
MATT RUSKIN: Fighting has
been around forever.


341
0:11:22,48 --> 0:11:24,15
People like to watch a fight.


342
0:11:24,15 --> 0:11:27,25
It appeals to to our
human instincts.


343
0:11:27,25 --> 0:11:28,945
A fight could break out in a
basketball game, a fight could


344
0:11:28,945 --> 0:11:30,43
break out in hockey.


345
0:11:30,43 --> 0:11:34,42
Any sport you know when you've
got guys competing there's a


346
0:11:34,42 --> 0:11:36,33
potential for a fight.


347
0:11:36,33 --> 0:11:38,24
We just cut through
the games and just


348
0:11:38,24 --> 0:11:39,665
get down to the fight.


349
0:11:39,665 --> 0:11:41,9
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Get the hooks in!


350
0:11:41,9 --> 0:11:46,8



351
0:11:46,8 --> 0:11:48,32
MATT RUSKIN: Dana White, the
president, of the UFC brought


352
0:11:48,32 --> 0:11:49,53
up a great point.


353
0:11:49,53 --> 0:11:52,1
What's more brutal
than the NFL?


354
0:11:52,1 --> 0:11:55,48
300 pound guys colliding into
each other, you know breaking


355
0:11:55,48 --> 0:11:56,73
bones all the time.


356
0:11:56,73 --> 0:12:0,596



357
0:12:0,596 --> 0:12:2,32
You know the whole point of
boxing is you're trying to


358
0:12:2,32 --> 0:12:3,74
knock somebody out.


359
0:12:3,74 --> 0:12:4,94
The whole point of mixed martial
arts is you are trying


360
0:12:4,94 --> 0:12:7,68
to beat them in a fight,
however your style is.


361
0:12:7,68 --> 0:12:10,26
You can get knocked out in
boxing get up, get knocked out


362
0:12:10,26 --> 0:12:12,78
again, get up, get knocked
out again.


363
0:12:12,78 --> 0:12:15,7
Mixed martial arts you get
clipped-- in my second fight I


364
0:12:15,7 --> 0:12:16,77
got clipped.


365
0:12:16,77 --> 0:12:17,59
I was dazed.


366
0:12:17,59 --> 0:12:20,76
I mean I don't think I was out
for more than a few seconds,


367
0:12:20,76 --> 0:12:23,38
but they stopped it so I
wouldn't take any more


368
0:12:23,38 --> 0:12:24,81
unneccesary punishment.


369
0:12:24,81 --> 0:12:28,73
But there's always someone out
there better than you.


370
0:12:28,73 --> 0:12:30,533
Some Iraq pictures.


371
0:12:30,533 --> 0:12:33,746
Fuckin' weapons cache
we found one day.


372
0:12:33,746 --> 0:12:37,42
RPGs, RPKs, AKs,
all that shit.


373
0:12:37,42 --> 0:12:39,32
My first boxing match ever.


374
0:12:39,32 --> 0:12:41,19
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN):
That guy's bicep is like


375
0:12:41,19 --> 0:12:42,81
bigger than like both my legs.


376
0:12:42,81 --> 0:12:45,68
MATT RUSKIN: Yeah, he was
a big mother fucker.


377
0:12:45,68 --> 0:12:46,972
Bing.


378
0:12:46,972 --> 0:12:48,295
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN):
You get in your ow licks?


379
0:12:48,295 --> 0:12:49,62
MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
I got in my own licks.


380
0:12:49,62 --> 0:12:52,11
We, we fought to a, to a draw.


381
0:12:52,11 --> 0:12:53,85
THOMAS MARTIN: I can
only imagine this


382
0:12:53,85 --> 0:12:54,53
in the fucking desert.


383
0:12:54,53 --> 0:12:55,31
MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN):
[LAUGHS]


384
0:12:55,31 --> 0:12:57,47
Fucking microwave is what is.


385
0:12:57,47 --> 0:12:58,92
THOMAS MARTIN: Yeah?


386
0:12:58,92 --> 0:13:0,25
MATT RUSKIN: You get a mix of
everybody in this sport.


387
0:13:0,25 --> 0:13:3,48
When you sit down with a bunch
of guys after one of these


388
0:13:3,48 --> 0:13:7,36
events and you really get their
stories these are all


389
0:13:7,36 --> 0:13:8,42
working guys.


390
0:13:8,42 --> 0:13:10,0
One guy may be a plumber.


391
0:13:10,0 --> 0:13:13,86
One guy, hey, I'm a cop, I work
as a personal trainer.


392
0:13:13,86 --> 0:13:17,8
You look at, at boxing years
ago, like high level


393
0:13:17,8 --> 0:13:19,97
pro-boxers used to have
a second job.


394
0:13:19,97 --> 0:13:22,16
I train people during the day.


395
0:13:22,16 --> 0:13:23,87
I'm either training for a fight
or training people.


396
0:13:23,87 --> 0:13:27,4
I really don't have
any spare time.


397
0:13:27,4 --> 0:13:29,9
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): The
one thing I kept hearing was


398
0:13:29,9 --> 0:13:32,49
how pure MMA is versus
other sports.


399
0:13:32,49 --> 0:13:34,71
All the guys seem really
sincere, like they're in it


400
0:13:34,71 --> 0:13:36,33
for the love of fighting
instead of just


401
0:13:36,33 --> 0:13:37,98
trying to make a living.


402
0:13:37,98 --> 0:13:39,92
I'm sure as it gets bigger and
more money comes in it'll


403
0:13:39,92 --> 0:13:42,31
start attracting the douchebags,
but right now it


404
0:13:42,31 --> 0:13:45,51
feels like it's sort of
in its golden age.


405
0:13:45,51 --> 0:13:48,222
So we're on our way to go to a
thing called conditioning.


406
0:13:48,222 --> 0:13:51,25
He told me it's going to make
him puke, so I'm just assuming


407
0:13:51,25 --> 0:13:54,25
that it's going to make me
really fucking puke.


408
0:13:54,25 --> 0:13:56,46
He's stopped off right now to
check in and try to buy some


409
0:13:56,46 --> 0:13:58,45
sports drink he likes.


410
0:13:58,45 --> 0:13:59,68
MATT RUSKIN: I got some good
stuff for recovery,


411
0:13:59,68 --> 0:14:0,64
rest and all that.


412
0:14:0,64 --> 0:14:1,89
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN):
Body enhancing chemicals.


413
0:14:1,89 --> 0:14:5,499



414
0:14:5,499 --> 0:14:7,613
MATT RUSKIN: You can tell I'm
really not feeling this today.


415
0:14:7,613 --> 0:14:10,77



416
0:14:10,77 --> 0:14:12,97
THOMAS MARTIN: I'm exhausted.


417
0:14:12,97 --> 0:14:14,467
MATT RUSKIN: You really haven't
seen tired before


418
0:14:14,467 --> 0:14:15,31
you've seen this.


419
0:14:15,31 --> 0:14:17,67
ALAN SPINDELL: We're going to do
the fight matrix, where we


420
0:14:17,67 --> 0:14:21,42
do the 15 pound dumbbells, the
crosses, the straight punches


421
0:14:21,42 --> 0:14:22,88
and then the down punches.


422
0:14:22,88 --> 0:14:24,195
Baby uppecuts, wider


423
0:14:24,195 --> 0:14:25,76
uppercuts, and turning uppercuts.


424
0:14:25,76 --> 0:14:28,21
THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): I'm
already completely lost.


425
0:14:28,21 --> 0:14:29,55
Then we'll go to explosives.


426
0:14:29,55 --> 0:14:32,812
ALAN SPINDELL: One,
Two, [INAUDIBLE]


427
0:14:32,812 --> 0:14:34,41
One, two--


428
0:14:34,41 --> 0:14:37,44
Then Kettle Bells- Come up,
snap your hips up--


429
0:14:37,44 --> 0:14:39,79
All these moves are
Jiu-Jitsu based--


430
0:14:39,79 --> 0:14:44,45
hammer throws, stradled,
right hand dominatnt.


431
0:14:44,45 --> 0:14:46,18
Boom, control.


432
0:14:46,18 --> 0:14:47,99
THOMAS MARTIN: Can he add
a few more elements?


433
0:14:47,99 --> 0:14:50,37
This is a ten pound
weighted vest.


434
0:14:50,37 --> 0:14:51,3
THOMAS MARTIN: Oh great.


435
0:14:51,3 --> 0:14:54,77
Matt does this course twice a
week at a local high school.


436
0:14:54,77 --> 0:14:56,58
It's basically a Looney
Tunes workout.


437
0:14:56,58 --> 0:14:58,93
ALAN SPINDELL: Russian
Twist, over unders.


438
0:14:58,93 --> 0:15:1,14
MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN): He kind
of reminded me of like Al


439
0:15:1,14 --> 0:15:4,81
Brooks's really enthusiastic
sports cousin.


440
0:15:4,81 --> 0:15:6,125
ALAN SPINDELL: Blast,
blast them.


441
0:15:6,125 --> 0:15:7,4
Boom, boom, boom.


442
0:15:7,4 --> 0:15:9,631
THOMAS MARTIN: OK, I totally
zoned out when he was about


443
0:15:9,631 --> 0:15:15,51
half way through those 30 or
40 different steps, so I'll


444
0:15:15,51 --> 0:15:16,902
just follow what Matt does.


445
0:15:16,902 --> 0:15:19,3
ALAN SPINDELL: Grab your balls
and let's get going.


446
0:15:19,3 --> 0:15:29,1



447
0:15:29,1 --> 0:15:32,503
MARIO: Uh Matt [INAUDIBLE]


448
0:15:32,503 --> 0:15:34,998
usually [INAUDIBLE]


449
0:15:34,998 --> 0:15:35,497
die.


450
0:15:35,497 --> 0:15:36,495
TENAISHA: Yeah.


451
0:15:36,495 --> 0:15:38,491
MARIO: And he was right next
to me all the way.


452
0:15:38,491 --> 0:16:9,928



453
0:16:9,928 --> 0:16:11,591
TENAISHA: He promised
to take it easy but


454
0:16:11,591 --> 0:16:12,922
he look like he's--


455
0:16:12,922 --> 0:16:13,92
MARIO: Going to throw up.


456
0:16:13,92 --> 0:16:15,17
TENAISHA: Yeah.


457
0:16:15,17 --> 0:16:21,904



458
0:16:21,904 --> 0:16:32,383
THOMAS MARTIN:
[GRUNTING WITH EXERTION]


459
0:16:32,383 --> 0:16:33,63
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You're
right there, you're two


460
0:16:33,63 --> 0:16:35,377
steps away, let's go.


461
0:16:35,377 --> 0:16:36,375
Alright good.


462
0:16:36,375 --> 0:16:37,373
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Round two!


463
0:16:37,373 --> 0:16:38,371
Ready for another one?


464
0:16:38,371 --> 0:16:41,49
THOMAS MARTIN: That's, that's
that's the warm up.


465
0:16:41,49 --> 0:16:43,86
The real workout consists of
running up and down eight


466
0:16:43,86 --> 0:16:46,17
flights of stairs while carrying
a 10 pound weight


467
0:16:46,17 --> 0:16:48,71
then jumping on a treadmill at
full speed and sprinting for


468
0:16:48,71 --> 0:16:51,73
20 seconds, then doing a whole
suite of weightlifting and


469
0:16:51,73 --> 0:16:54,85
these weird rope pull-ups, and
then you do the whole thing


470
0:16:54,85 --> 0:16:55,92
two more times.


471
0:16:55,92 --> 0:16:59,906
It's easily the most exercise
I've ever done in my life.


472
0:16:59,906 --> 0:17:3,86
I feel like I'm in an alternate
state right now.


473
0:17:3,86 --> 0:17:5,72
I feel like I'm peaking
on shrooms.


474
0:17:5,72 --> 0:17:8,954
My body feels totally
alien to me.


475
0:17:8,954 --> 0:17:12,96



476
0:17:12,96 --> 0:17:15,122
Oh good Matt's barfing.


477
0:17:15,122 --> 0:17:20,47
I feel bad that I didn't
but I feel bad enough.


478
0:17:20,47 --> 0:17:23,6
I'll see you uh, next week
have a good weekend--


479
0:17:23,6 --> 0:17:24,48
MATT RUSKIN: Take care man.


480
0:17:24,48 --> 0:17:25,79
THOMAS MARTIN: Rest.


481
0:17:25,79 --> 0:17:26,655
MATT RUSKIN: Ah, later.


482
0:17:26,655 --> 0:17:28,4
THOMAS MARTIN: I kind
of cut corners.


483
0:17:28,4 --> 0:17:30,95
Um it was slighty painful
but everybody, everybody


484
0:17:30,95 --> 0:17:32,61
was nice about it.


485
0:17:32,61 --> 0:17:35,61
I can feel, I can feel in my
muscles at the moment that


486
0:17:35,61 --> 0:17:37,91
within four or five hours
I'm going to be


487
0:17:37,91 --> 0:17:40,34
sorer than I ever have.


488
0:17:40,34 --> 0:17:42,78
And uh, right now I'm just going
to go get some, some


489
0:17:42,78 --> 0:17:46,5
fucking cytomax and see
if I can chill before


490
0:17:46,5 --> 0:17:47,3
the pain sets in.


491
0:17:47,3 --> 0:19:47,3
