1
0:0:0,919 --> 0:0:5,92
>> JOANNE: Coming up next on KPBS Evening
Edition, just how small is a small radioactive


2
0:0:5,92 --> 0:0:9,249
leak?
More on the San Onofre power shutdown.


3
0:0:9,249 --> 0:0:14,16
>> PEGGY: And San Diego is running out of
parking spaces.


4
0:0:14,16 --> 0:0:20,3
>> JOANNE: And the new owners of the "UT"
San Diego make a major announcement today.


5
0:0:20,3 --> 0:0:25,29
Give you a hint!
>> PEGGY: Lights, camera, action!


6
0:0:25,29 --> 0:0:43,879
KPBS Evening Edition starts now.
>> JOANNE: Hello thanks for joining us, I'm


7
0:0:43,879 --> 0:0:46,559
Joanne Faryon.
>> PEGGY: And I'm Peggy Pico in for Dwane


8
0:0:46,559 --> 0:0:49,829
brown.
>> JOANNE: The "UT" announced it will expand


9
0:0:49,829 --> 0:1:3,399
it's news service, it's called "UT TV" at
a rotary club today, and it will eventually


10
0:1:3,399 --> 0:1:9,46
expand to an all news cable channel.
KPBS confirmed this with Doug Manchester.


11
0:1:9,46 --> 0:1:20,81
>> PEGGY: The Pala Indian tribe has expelled
154 of its members.


12
0:1:20,81 --> 0:1:34,299
Adrian Florido tells us what that means.
What's the impact of this decision?


13
0:1:34,299 --> 0:1:39,259
>> It represents about 15% of the tribe's
population and among other things it means


14
0:1:39,259 --> 0:1:46,27
those people will no longer be receiving payments
of $150,000 a year, money from the profits


15
0:1:46,27 --> 0:1:50,95
of the casino that the tribe operates east
of association side.


16
0:1:50,95 --> 0:1:54,619
>> PEGGY: And the obvious question is why
were they kicked out?


17
0:1:54,619 --> 0:1:59,369
>> They're not saying.
A smokesman for the tribe said this they were


18
0:1:59,369 --> 0:2:3,829
exercising their right to determine who its
members are.


19
0:2:3,829 --> 0:2:10,399
Back in JuneÊthey did expel another 8 people
saying that those people did not have the


20
0:2:10,399 --> 0:2:14,349
sufficient sort of blood line to be members
of the tribe.


21
0:2:14,349 --> 0:2:20,79
To be a member of the tribe you have to have
1 16th Pala Indian blood and they have a formula


22
0:2:20,79 --> 0:2:26,66
to calculate that.
>> PEGGY: How common is this?


23
0:2:26,66 --> 0:2:31,9
>> It's getting more common especially in
California in the last ten years since tribes


24
0:2:31,9 --> 0:2:38,25
started operating casinos and, again rating
profits which have to be split up among the


25
0:2:38,25 --> 0:2:41,9
members.
They're not saying that's what's happening


26
0:2:41,9 --> 0:2:45,239
here but it is a trend that's happening across
the state and across the country.


27
0:2:45,239 --> 0:2:51,56
>> PEGGY: And I understand the tribe's spokesman
said they can appeal the decision.


28
0:2:51,56 --> 0:2:55,26
Thank you.
>> JOANNE: An Solana beach woman was arrested


29
0:2:55,26 --> 0:3:7,59
today 
for embezzling.
Jennifer Davie worked as a bookkeeper for


30
0:3:7,59 --> 0:3:17,92
nearly seven years.
>> PEGGY: Mayor sanders said he will wait


31
0:3:17,92 --> 0:3:26,19
on a plan to finance a $520 million convention
center expansion, Katie Orr joins me from


32
0:3:26,19 --> 0:3:30,99
the news center with details.
Katie, you spoke to Todd Gloria today, what


33
0:3:30,99 --> 0:3:33,599
did he say?
>> He agreed with the mayor, Peggy, he said


34
0:3:33,599 --> 0:3:38,299
it was always the plan to have the Court validate
this funding mechanism and that's because


35
0:3:38,299 --> 0:3:43,11
it's a fairly new way to go about funding
things and the question is since this involves


36
0:3:43,11 --> 0:3:49,579
raising the hotel tax do San Diego city voters
need to vote to approve it versus the hotel


37
0:3:49,579 --> 0:3:54,769
and motel voting.
>> PEGGY: And if the funding mechanism is


38
0:3:54,769 --> 0:3:58,32
deemed illegal how will this expansion get
funded?


39
0:3:58,32 --> 0:4:4,769
>> That's up in the air, it'sed 520 million,
so it's likely that they would have to go


40
0:4:4,769 --> 0:4:10,189
to city voters and ask them to approve that
tax, but as we know, San Diego city voters


41
0:4:10,189 --> 0:4:15,659
are always hesitant to approve new taxes so
it's certainly something supporters are hoping


42
0:4:15,659 --> 0:4:19,82
they won't have to do.
>> PEGGY: Thank you very much, Katie Orr our


43
0:4:19,82 --> 0:4:23,67
Metro reporter.
>> JOANNE: California lawmakers are taking


44
0:4:23,67 --> 0:4:28,47
steps to avoid cash flow problems this spring
by letting the state borrow from existing


45
0:4:28,47 --> 0:4:31,98
government funds.
This is meant to ensure that the state has


46
0:4:31,98 --> 0:4:36,39
enough money until the majority of tax revenueses
start arriving in April.


47
0:4:36,39 --> 0:4:41,4
Controller says he doesn't expect to have
to issue IOUs.


48
0:4:41,4 --> 0:4:49,97
>> PEGGY: San Diego's chapter of the American
red cross has now a high tech disaster command


49
0:4:49,97 --> 0:4:56,45
center, and I got a tour today, here is a
look inside.


50
0:4:56,45 --> 0:5:5,32
Images of San Diego's worst disaster display
continuously at the American red cross center


51
0:5:5,32 --> 0:5:9,95
in Kearney Mesa.
Volunteers share critical information with


52
0:5:9,95 --> 0:5:15,67
other disaster centers throughout the state
and county in realtime.


53
0:5:15,67 --> 0:5:21,6
That helps victims and responders alike.
>>> By putting in the technology in this room


54
0:5:21,6 --> 0:5:27,5
we are able now to go ahead and cut down our
response time from 8 hours to 1 hour.


55
0:5:27,5 --> 0:5:33,65
>> PEGGY: Giant monsters display the nearest
shelters, evacuation routes, fires and daily


56
0:5:33,65 --> 0:5:41,59
crises situations pop up as they happen.
>>> We keep track of things, be it a prescribed


57
0:5:41,59 --> 0:5:49,36
burn, so we know what's happening.
>> PEGGY: Here the dots represent regional


58
0:5:49,36 --> 0:5:56,35
mini earthquakes that happened today, while
this map works as a visual conference call


59
0:5:56,35 --> 0:6:2,23
linking this center with other emergency responders.
>>> We can see what's going on and get different


60
0:6:2,23 --> 0:6:7,6
views of it.
>> PEGGY: The American red cross calls its


61
0:6:7,6 --> 0:6:13,33
chapter disaster center CDOC.
It was funded by nonrestricted donations.


62
0:6:13,33 --> 0:6:22,97
Tonight we look at the leak at the San Onofre's
nuclear plant at the round table.


63
0:6:22,97 --> 0:6:31,75
>> JOANNE: Officials are trying to figure
out what went wrong Tuesday when a steam generator


64
0:6:31,75 --> 0:6:40,72
began leaking gallons of radioactive water,
joining me now is Murray Jennex, with expertise


65
0:6:40,72 --> 0:6:48,12
in nuclear containment testing and he works
for San Onofre for several years.


66
0:6:48,12 --> 0:6:50,41
>>> I'm also with the college of business,
butÊ


67
0:6:50,41 --> 0:6:54,61
>> JOANNE: Several credentials!
Let's start with a brief explanation on what


68
0:6:54,61 --> 0:7:0,1
it means when there is a leak like this.
>>> In this case when they say there is a


69
0:7:0,1 --> 0:7:6,38
leak to protect the public we have barriers
against a release of radiation and products


70
0:7:6,38 --> 0:7:15,58
that might have radiation in them.
We have a coolant and it can carry the heat


71
0:7:15,58 --> 0:7:20,83
away, we pass that through a steam generator
and we use clean water on the other side to


72
0:7:20,83 --> 0:7:27,59
power the turbine, that's where this leak
is, the primary coolant water coming off the


73
0:7:27,59 --> 0:7:33,94
react tore and the water going into the turbine.
>> JOANNE: I want to read from the NRC report


74
0:7:33,94 --> 0:7:45,71
and it says at 3:05 unit 3 entered abnormal
coolant leak, leak exceeding 5 gallons per


75
0:7:45,71 --> 0:7:55,82
day, and they realized it was 82 gallons per
day, and later it goes into a stage of a leakage


76
0:7:55,82 --> 0:8:0,37
exceeding 30 gallons per when our.
Is that a lot?


77
0:8:0,37 --> 0:8:5,89
>> It sounds like a lot but it actual isn't.
They use over 16,000 gallons of water a day


78
0:8:5,89 --> 0:8:12,2
just to run the plant so we're talk bug a
very small amount of water and the volumes


79
0:8:12,2 --> 0:8:16,32
that we're looking at are huge so it's not
something that's easily detected.


80
0:8:16,32 --> 0:8:25,5
The way it was detected is primarily by a
radiation monitor, otherwise they probably


81
0:8:25,5 --> 0:8:30,28
wouldn't have noticed for quite a while.
>> JOANNE: The consequence of a leak like


82
0:8:30,28 --> 0:8:33,829
this, aren't we worried about what escapes
into our atmosphere?


83
0:8:33,829 --> 0:8:38,969
>> We are, and in this case, the leak is inside
the containment building so there is your


84
0:8:38,969 --> 0:8:45,4
first barrier and they noticed that the gas
that came out was in the auxiliary building,


85
0:8:45,4 --> 0:8:52,19
also keep in mind this is primary coolant,
it's not spent fuel, it's gas.


86
0:8:52,19 --> 0:8:58,66
This gas doesn't stay radioactive for very
long, it has a short lifetime within an hour


87
0:8:58,66 --> 0:9:3,199
it's gone so that's why they can't tell us
how much leaked because it's difficult to


88
0:9:3,199 --> 0:9:9,42
measure something that disappears that fast.
>> JOANNE: This is a new steam generator,


89
0:9:9,42 --> 0:9:14,79
this was installed recently, does it surprise
you that something so new is leaking?


90
0:9:14,79 --> 0:9:17,689
>> Absolutely as an engineer I would have
liked to have seen it go a few years before


91
0:9:17,689 --> 0:9:23,98
a tube leak occurred.
They occur on a regular basis, we can't predict


92
0:9:23,98 --> 0:9:30,16
when they will occur but we have had several
over the last severe years so it's an incident,


93
0:9:30,16 --> 0:9:36,42
not an accident.
The fact that it happened so early makes people


94
0:9:36,42 --> 0:9:39,29
wonder perhaps if there is a manufacturing
problem or not.


95
0:9:39,29 --> 0:9:43,55
I think that's why they're being careful about
what they say is the cause, they want to analyze


96
0:9:43,55 --> 0:9:48,73
it and see if it's because there is a weird
flow condition, that could cause excessive


97
0:9:48,73 --> 0:9:54,739
vibration on areas of the tubes, and I suspect
that's what the case is here.


98
0:9:54,739 --> 0:9:59,209
>> JOANNE: What is your biggest concern when
you look at an incident like this?


99
0:9:59,209 --> 0:10:2,749
As somebody who has worked there, you're an
expert, what would be the biggest question


100
0:10:2,749 --> 0:10:6,889
that you would have?
>> My biggest question is why did it occur


101
0:10:6,889 --> 0:10:13,29
within a year of this new generator being
online and to me that says that perhaps we


102
0:10:13,29 --> 0:10:17,68
they'd to make sure that we're taking care
of the generator in the right way, we have


103
0:10:17,68 --> 0:10:23,569
the right chemistry, we're not exceeding temperature
limits or flow limits, making sure that everything


104
0:10:23,569 --> 0:10:29,91
is being done according to procedure and making
sure we know how it's behaving inside.


105
0:10:29,91 --> 0:10:34,11
They're going to do inspections, some inspections
that measure the thickness of the wall and


106
0:10:34,11 --> 0:10:37,479
cease if there is problem, it will see if
there is an area of concern.


107
0:10:37,479 --> 0:10:42,519
>> JOANNE: We know they aren't generating
power because of this and we know unit 2 it


108
0:10:42,519 --> 0:10:48,79
says is in shutdown in a refueling outage,
are they generating any power and if they


109
0:10:48,79 --> 0:10:52,509
are not, are they losing money?
>> They are not generating power at San Onofre


110
0:10:52,509 --> 0:10:59,3
and yes, southern Cal Edison is losing money
unless they're able to make up the power from


111
0:10:59,3 --> 0:11:3,66
their own sources, otherwise they have to
buy it off the market and we get power from


112
0:11:3,66 --> 0:11:12,399
the northwest, hydro plants up there and,
again rate tors of power, Arizona and so forth.


113
0:11:12,399 --> 0:11:17,9
Right now, this time of year power is relatively
cheap compared to in the summer when it's


114
0:11:17,9 --> 0:11:19,279
hot.
>> JOANNE: If you had to put a dollar amount


115
0:11:19,279 --> 0:11:24,61
on what they're losing what would you guess?
>> $600,000 to a million a day


116
0:11:24,61 --> 0:11:32,1
>> JOANNE: Dr.ÊMurray Jennex thank you for
being here.


117
0:11:32,1 --> 0:11:35,649
>>> You're welcome.
>> PEGGY: Finding a place to park is a frustration


118
0:11:35,649 --> 0:11:40,879
for San Diego drivers, now the San Diego city
council will take on the challenge of of finding


119
0:11:40,879 --> 0:11:45,959
a place for our cars.
And how do you talk to children about serious


120
0:11:45,959 --> 0:12:7,139
illness, we'll have insights for hard conversations.
>> PEGGY: The San Diego city council will


121
0:12:7,139 --> 0:12:12,4
consider a proposal to reduce the number of
parking spaces required for each new unit


122
0:12:12,4 --> 0:12:18,139
of affordable housing.
It's a move to cut costs and prevent parking


123
0:12:18,139 --> 0:13:52,6
lots from taking over the city, morning edition's
reporter Tom Fudge checks out this story.


124
0:13:52,6 --> 0:13:56,36
>>> It's something most of us do ever single
day.


125
0:13:56,36 --> 0:14:1,74
We jump in a car, drive someplace and then
we need to find a parking space.


126
0:14:1,74 --> 0:14:6,199
>>> You got to get here an hourly early.
>>> I went around the campus trying to find


127
0:14:6,199 --> 0:14:10,839
a spot took a half an hour.
>>> I park illegally until I can find a parking


128
0:14:10,839 --> 0:14:13,759
space.
>>> It's hard to find a civic concern more


129
0:14:13,759 --> 0:14:23,22
universal than finding a place to park your
car.


130
0:14:23,22 --> 0:14:30,829
Dallen Hoffman says to find a parking space
is difficult.


131
0:14:30,829 --> 0:14:36,99
>>> The grocery store, the shopping mall,
and so on.


132
0:14:36,99 --> 0:14:42,829
In 2010 there were 3.1 million people living
in San Diego county who owned an estimated


133
0:14:42,829 --> 0:14:49,47
2.1 million cars, now imagine a million more
people living in San Diego county by 2030


134
0:14:49,47 --> 0:14:59,439
as is predicted, that's 685,000 more cars,
hoffman says that will require 37 square miles


135
0:14:59,439 --> 0:15:8,11
of additional parking space.
>>> We can either pave over all of San Diego


136
0:15:8,11 --> 0:15:15,139
bay, all of Mission Bay, all of the city of
La Mesa and then build a 2 story parking deck


137
0:15:15,139 --> 0:15:20,19
over all of Balboa Park or
>> Or we couldÊ let's not go there, in fact,


138
0:15:20,19 --> 0:15:24,69
we don't have to go anywhere to imagine what
parking demands do to a city.


139
0:15:24,69 --> 0:15:29,839
There is no better example of how it affects
the landscape than the parking lot Qualcomm,


140
0:15:29,839 --> 0:15:44,479
there are 19,000 parking spaces here and they're
rarely used.


141
0:15:44,479 --> 0:15:49,269
>>> There are problems with parking policy
and we start with the example of this downtown


142
0:15:49,269 --> 0:15:57,35
parking garage which enjoys a public subsidy.
>>> It actually costs less to park here for


143
0:15:57,35 --> 0:16:0,899
a month than it costs to buy a monthly transit
pass.


144
0:16:0,899 --> 0:16:9,959
>>> They are point is is transit use is is
discouraged.


145
0:16:9,959 --> 0:16:14,8
Transit is not practical for all destinations,
but lowe says people should at least pay the


146
0:16:14,8 --> 0:16:18,869
real cost of parking.
>>> This isn't about forcing people into transit,


147
0:16:18,869 --> 0:16:26,1
this is about creating choices for people
and making transit an attractive choice by


148
0:16:26,1 --> 0:16:30,689
reflecting the true cost of park and go driving
is where we need to go.


149
0:16:30,689 --> 0:16:35,939
>>> Another approach is to do something with
all that spare pavement we have in San Diego.


150
0:16:35,939 --> 0:16:47,48
San Diego has a lot of very wide residential
streets, hoffman says that's wide enough to


151
0:16:47,48 --> 0:16:53,209
create head in park and go increase the number
of spaces by 35%.


152
0:16:53,209 --> 0:16:59,47
>>> So by going on to head in parking these
extremely wide streets that are typical in


153
0:16:59,47 --> 0:17:5,589
a lot of San Diego we're able to pick up dozens
or hundreds of parking spaces all for the


154
0:17:5,589 --> 0:17:10,89
price of some paint.
>>> Most lots are empty at least 50% of the


155
0:17:10,89 --> 0:17:15,18
time making better use of that space can for
one thing make our cities more attractive


156
0:17:15,18 --> 0:17:21,15
and vital.
Here in north park this lot is converted to


157
0:17:21,15 --> 0:17:25,77
a farmers market once a week.
Gary Smith is a member of the downtown parking


158
0:17:25,77 --> 0:17:29,49
management group.
He says we should use those periodically empty


159
0:17:29,49 --> 0:17:34,11
lots to park more cars that belong to people
who keep different schedules.


160
0:17:34,11 --> 0:17:40,46
Here he speaks of downtown residential buildings.
>>> I could build another three or four high


161
0:17:40,46 --> 0:17:47,4
rise buildings around this commercial building
and satisfy the parking requirements for those


162
0:17:47,4 --> 0:17:53,87
in the basement of that commercial building
because they only use those for the daylight


163
0:17:53,87 --> 0:17:58,53
hours.
>>> About 50 years ago a writer named Lewis


164
0:17:58,53 --> 0:18:4,15
mumford wrote "the right to have access to
every building in the city by private motor


165
0:18:4,15 --> 0:18:11,37
car in an age when everyone possesses such
a vehicle is the right to destroy the city"


166
0:18:11,37 --> 0:18:19,42
mumFord might think San Diego has gone down
that path, where people navigate an ocean


167
0:18:19,42 --> 0:18:25,87
of asphalt but Smith says we don't have to
keep paving the city we can make better use


168
0:18:25,87 --> 0:18:34,18
of what we've got.
>>> We did a study in 2006, which was only


169
0:18:34,18 --> 0:18:40,8
a few years ago there were ten parking spaces
in the city of San Diego for every car that


170
0:18:40,8 --> 0:18:45,53
was registered in the city of San Diego.
Okay?


171
0:18:45,53 --> 0:18:49,2
It's not a shortage of parking it's a matter
of having the parking where people want to


172
0:18:49,2 --> 0:18:55,75
go and having the parking work correctly.
>> PEGGY: That was Tom Fudge reporting.


173
0:18:55,75 --> 0:18:59,93
The move to reduce the number of parking spaces
required for new affordable housing units


174
0:18:59,93 --> 0:19:3,72
in San Diego will go before the city planning
commission in April.


175
0:19:3,72 --> 0:19:10,24
Then it will head to the city council.
It's a hard topic for families to tackle,


176
0:19:10,24 --> 0:19:15,28
but Joanne's next guest at the round table
says it's something families should be talking


177
0:19:15,28 --> 0:19:21,95
about.
>> JOANNE: Parents alwaysment to protect their


178
0:19:21,95 --> 0:19:26,48
kids, not just from real danger but also from
sadness and insecurities.


179
0:19:26,48 --> 0:19:32,8
The reaction of many people if they get seriously
ill is to keep their illness from their kids.


180
0:19:32,8 --> 0:19:37,41
It's often not the best idea.
A book that has helped thousands maneuver


181
0:19:37,41 --> 0:19:43,8
through the illness and the death of a parent
has been revised and updated, it's the result


182
0:19:43,8 --> 0:19:48,9
of a collaboration between a child life specialist
and a reporter, joining me is that reporter,


183
0:19:48,9 --> 0:19:54,61
Ron Vaughn who teaches journalism at the University
of San Diego.


184
0:19:54,61 --> 0:19:59,71
Thank you for being here.
Tell me how you got involved in this?


185
0:19:59,71 --> 0:20:9,49
>> I was working for NBC news today as a science
specialist and I got a flyer from the Cleveland


186
0:20:9,49 --> 0:20:18,12
clinic saying they had a program to help children
of gravely ill or fatally ill parents and


187
0:20:18,12 --> 0:20:25,22
it struck me, I had seen a dozen good programs
for the parents of sick children, I had never


188
0:20:25,22 --> 0:20:28,93
seen anything for helping the children of
sick parents.


189
0:20:28,93 --> 0:20:36,15
I went out and met Kathleen McQue who deviced
the program and I was stunned by what she


190
0:20:36,15 --> 0:20:41,4
was accomplishing with these children.
I would sit down with a 10 year old girl,


191
0:20:41,4 --> 0:20:47,54
12 year old boy whose mother or father had
died and these kids were okay.


192
0:20:47,54 --> 0:20:52,57
They could sit and talk about it, they could
talk about their lives, talk about their friends,


193
0:20:52,57 --> 0:20:57,26
they were okay.
And it was because of what Kathleen did, her


194
0:20:57,26 --> 0:21:2,92
techniques, and what they could handle.
What she learned is with a little help from


195
0:21:2,92 --> 0:21:8,55
grown ups, the kids can handle it.
>> JOANNE: Let's talk about the techniques,


196
0:21:8,55 --> 0:21:16,5
this is what you outline in the book.
What's first thing that most of us would do


197
0:21:16,5 --> 0:21:20,3
wrong?
>> Protect the children from the truth.


198
0:21:20,3 --> 0:21:27,76
If youÊ at this point when there is a crisis
in your family, something bad is happening


199
0:21:27,76 --> 0:21:33,7
and if you try to pretend to your children
that it's not happening, you can create a


200
0:21:33,7 --> 0:21:40,61
distrust that will last a lifetime.
You must never tell the child anything but


201
0:21:40,61 --> 0:21:44,83
the truth.
Now, you don't always tell the entire truth


202
0:21:44,83 --> 0:21:50,87
right now, and we go into that in this book,
for instance, in genetic diseases, it's a


203
0:21:50,87 --> 0:21:57,38
disease that might not occur for 15 years,
you don't want to tell the child everything


204
0:21:57,38 --> 0:22:4,36
but you never tell the child "nothing is wrong"
you never tell them "mom's on a vacation"


205
0:22:4,36 --> 0:22:11,57
you never tell them "dad is on a secret mission."
If the mom or dad is in the hospital, dying,


206
0:22:11,57 --> 0:22:18,39
the child must prepare and must trust you,
the adult who is telling the story.


207
0:22:18,39 --> 0:22:23,16
>> JOANNE: Ron, when we were talking just
a few moments ago about a movie nominated


208
0:22:23,16 --> 0:22:28,58
for an Oscar and you were saying that the
events in this movie parallel a lot of the


209
0:22:28,58 --> 0:22:33,82
advice you give in this book.
>>> I was amazed, as I sat and watched that


210
0:22:33,82 --> 0:22:39,35
movie, the movie starts with a terrible boating
accident and the young mother of two young


211
0:22:39,35 --> 0:22:47,33
girls, 12 and 17 is in a coma.
The father, played by George Clooney is the


212
0:22:47,33 --> 0:22:52,86
way you and I might be.
This disaster has happened, he has no idea


213
0:22:52,86 --> 0:22:58,75
how to cope with it but as he goes through
the movie he does almost everything right


214
0:22:58,75 --> 0:23:6,84
with his girls and I sat there thinking yes,
yes, because he keeps them in the loop, they


215
0:23:6,84 --> 0:23:12,7
know what he knows, when the doctors are still
holding out hope for the mother he says mom


216
0:23:12,7 --> 0:23:19,96
may come out of it, but when the doctors say,
no, this is terminal, he says, "mom will not


217
0:23:19,96 --> 0:23:25,73
come out of this coma."
When the younger girl gets beyond anything


218
0:23:25,73 --> 0:23:30,97
he can handle he brings in professional help.
He gets therapists in.


219
0:23:30,97 --> 0:23:37,3
But the most powerful thing in the movie and
it's choking me up, when they finally take


220
0:23:37,3 --> 0:23:43,42
the mother off of life support, he lets both
girls say goodbye.


221
0:23:43,42 --> 0:23:50,19
And thatÊ a child who is prevented from saying
goodbye, that can scar them emotionally for


222
0:23:50,19 --> 0:23:53,45
life.
So I am sitting there, ready to give Clooney


223
0:23:53,45 --> 0:23:56,51
the Oscar just for the way he is handling
these two girls.


224
0:23:56,51 --> 0:24:2,58
>> JOANNE: Ron, where can we find your book?
>> Barnes & Noble, Amazon.com and I'll be


225
0:24:2,58 --> 0:24:15,44
doing a book 
signing next month.
>> JOANNE: Ron Bonn thank you for being here.


226
0:24:15,44 --> 0:24:23,86
>>> Thank you.
This book can help families in this situation,


227
0:24:23,86 --> 0:24:26,45
but they've got to know it exists.
Thank you.


228
0:24:26,45 --> 0:24:30,11
>> JOANNE: Thank you.
>> PEGGY: Coming up next in the public square,


229
0:24:30,11 --> 0:24:34,86
Joanne wants to know what you think about
the big announcement today from "UT San Diego."


230
0:24:34,86 --> 0:25:57,94

As we told you earlier, the "UT San Diego"


232

me an email.
Now let's go back to the news desk where Peggy


237
0:26:29,9 --> 0:26:34,43
has a recap.
>> PEGGY: Mayor sanders says he will wait


238
0:26:34,43 --> 0:26:39,81
for the courts to decide whether a new hotel
tax is legal before moving forward on a plan


239
0:26:39,81 --> 0:26:49,93
to finances the convention center expansion.
The Pala band of indians has expelled 154


240
0:26:49,93 --> 0:26:56,2
people from its tribe.
The members stand to loose $150,000 in annual


241
0:26:56,2 --> 0:27:1,51
payments from the tribe's casinos.
And state lawmakers are taking steps to avoid


242
0:27:1,51 --> 0:27:6,85
a cash flow problem this spring by letting
the state barrow from existing government


243
0:27:6,85 --> 0:27:9,45
funds.
Today's action is meant to her ensure that


244
0:27:9,45 --> 0:27:14,56
the state has enough money until tax revenues
start arriving in April.


245
