###2 CHARLET DUBOC: On top of having to organize a fashion
###4 week, Billy Bad Ass had just become a father for the second
###7 time and was spending the morning taking
###10 his newborn son home.
###12 So to kill time, we decided to explore one of our favorite
###15 Atlanta urban legends.
###17 We went to meet the guy responsible for the face
###20 tattoo which catapulted Gucci Mane to viral fame.
###23 
###26 So Shane, what happened that day?
###29 SHANE WILLOUGHBY: He had quite a few tattoos on his face.
###31 And he felt that some of the ones around his eyes made him
###35 look like he had a black eye.
###37 And he wanted a tattoo that took away from those.
###41 I was like, I couldn't really suggest
###43 anything for your face.
###46 He was like, well, what about this?
###47 And he unzipped his hoodie, and he had the largest piece
###51 of jewelry I've ever seen.
###52 This large ice cream cone medallion that was just
###54 covered in diamonds.
###56 And I was like, OK.
###57 I think I could put something together.
###59 Here's the stencil right here.
###61 CHARLET DUBOC: [GASP]
###62 Oh my god.
###63 SHANE WILLOUGHBY: One day I'll get around to framing it.
###65 CHARLET DUBOC: Let me imagine.
###66 
###69 No way!
###70 SHANE WILLOUGHBY: He said, I want it to be rock and roll.
###73 And so that's where the lightning bolts came from.
###77 CHARLET DUBOC: And with the Brrr.
###78 SHANE WILLOUGHBY: That was kind of funny.
###79 I see a lot of people stating how I misspelled that.
###83 And it's kind of funny.
###85 CHARLET DUBOC: It's not a word.
###86 SHANE WILLOUGHBY: Yeah.
###86 It's a sound.
###88 CHARLET DUBOC: What happened at work the next day?
###90 SHANE WILLOUGHBY: The phone ringing off the hook.
###93 Hip hop radio stations calling.
###95 After misquotes got out, I no longer really wanted
###99 to talk about it.
###100 CHARLET DUBOC: What about the actual tattooing process?
###102 Was he a hard man or was he a bit of a pussy?
###105 SHANE WILLOUGHBY: It's almost like he was asleep.
###107 CHARLET DUBOC: Really.
###107 SHANE WILLOUGHBY: Yeah, he didn't move, didn't make a
###108 sound, unless we were talking.
###111 CHARLET DUBOC: Have you found that there have been more
###113 rappers getting tattoos?
###115 Is it a lot more popular?
###115 SHANE WILLOUGHBY: Oh, yes.
###117 It's gone from rappers having the little forearm tattoos to
###122 being fully covered.
###125 Tattooing in Atlanta, no matter where you tattoo-- if
###128 you tattoo in Atlanta, you're an urban tattooer.
###130 CHARLET DUBOC: What's been your weirdest tattoo request
###133 in your career?
###136 SHANE WILLOUGHBY: A penis on a lady in her 50s, lower back.
###140 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###141 CHARLET DUBOC: And with that charming image in mind, we
###144 said goodbye to Shane and went to meet Billy.
###146 
###149 We've come out to the suburbs of Atlanta.
###151 This is where Billy lives.
###152 He's invited us to his house, which is really nice
###156 considering the circumstances.
###157 He's got a 48-hour-old baby in there.
###160 He's invited us to come and see where he works from.
###163 And then I think the plan is that we're going to the local
###166 car dealership to maybe buy a Range Rover.
###169 
###171 BILLY BAD ASS: Hello.
###173 Hey.
###173 What's happening?
###175 CHARLET DUBOC: I don't want to wake the baby.
###177 BILLY BAD ASS: Come on in.
###178 Come on.
###180 My war room-- this is my war room.
###182 My treadmill.
###183 CHARLET DUBOC: Your war room?
###184 BILLY BAD ASS: Yeah.
###185 I put my information of my events--
###187 what city I'm going to.
###190 Information I need, like locations.
###194 They gave me an award.
###196 I'm a pioneer in urban fashion, and they felt like
###199 they needed to give me something for my outstanding
###201 achievement.
###203 CHARLET DUBOC: You're a fashion pioneer?
###204 BILLY BAD ASS: Yes.
###206 CHARLET DUBOC: Despite the disorganized appearance of the
###208 war room, Billy was keen to share some of his theories on
###212 achieving success.
###214 What was the book you were telling me about yesterday?
###216 "Who Moved the Cheese?"
###217 BILLY BAD ASS: "Who Moved the Cheese?" This
###218 was about two rats.
###219 They call them Hem and Haw and Skip and Scurry.
###223 They had a maze-- it was a maze.
###225 Hem and Haw went in first and went around.
###228 And they didn't see any cheese, so they came back out.
###231 Well, Skip and Scurry went in and kept going.
###234 And they looked, and they didn't see nothing.
###235 They kept going all the way.
###236 And then they found cheese.
###238 So Hem and Haw was like, they in there.
###239 They must have found some cheese.
###240 So they went and found the cheese where
###243 Skip and Scurry was.
###244 And after a while, the cheese ran out.
###246 There was no more cheese.
###248 So what Skip and Scurry did--
###250 they went further in and looked for more cheese.
###253 And it took them a little while.
###255 They kept going.
###256 They found more cheese.
###257 But the moral of the story was that the cheese might run out.
###261 So what do you do?
###262 Are you going to sit around and wait for more cheese in
###264 the same area, or are you going to find another solution
###267 to solving a problem?
###269 HAW: What will happen if the cheese isn't here tomorrow?
###271 I've made plans based on this cheese!
###275 CHARLET DUBOC: It was clear that Billy had every intention
###277 of chasing the cheese.
###279 Maybe that was part of the reason behind taking his Urban
###282 Fashion Week on the road--
###283 to find some exotic foreign cheese.
###286 Some Stilton, perhaps.
###290 However, in my experience, putting on a fashion week
###292 takes some work.
###294 And I'd yet to see examples of the clothes, designers, and
###297 crew that are usually a requirement for such an event.
###301 Billy assured me that this was all in hand.
###303 But first there were more pressing issues
###306 to take care of.
###307 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###313 CHARLET DUBOC: So where are we going?
###314 BILLY BAD ASS: We're going to a dealership.
###316 I've been looking at some cars I want to get.
###318 CHARLET DUBOC: And what car do you want?
###320 BILLY BAD ASS: I want a Range Rover.
###323 CHARLET DUBOC: Cool.
###324 BILLY BAD ASS: Isn't that an English car?
###326 CHARLET DUBOC: Yeah.
###326 People who drive Range Rovers really are like wealthy white
###331 women with kids.
###332 BILLY BAD ASS: [LAUGHS]
###335 CHARLET DUBOC: It's funny, right?
###336 BILLY BAD ASS: That's hilarious.
###338 
###343 Yeah, the guy that we need to meet is not there right now.
###346 So we're going to come back.
###348 I don't know if you remember Holyfield, the boxer?
###351 Well, he's being sued.
###354 The car that I'm getting ready to buy was his car.
###359 He's a celebrity.
###361 I'd like to have the car.
###363 It just reminds me of how he was at his prime.
###367 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###369 CHARLET DUBOC: Listening to Billy talk of his aspirations
###371 to buy the repossessed car of a broke boxer didn't seem to
###375 fit with the cheese-chasing philosophy.
###379 So little time and London creeping ever closer.
###383 However, Billy was unfazed, and wanted to take us to one
###386 of Atlanta's high end urban fashion boutiques, as he said
###390 it would give us an idea of what we could expect to see on
###392 the catwalk at London Urban Fashion Week.
###395 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###396 BILLY BAD ASS: How you doing?
###396 -What's up?
###397 BILLY BAD ASS: All right.
###398 I've just told them about your store.
###400 You do a lot of celebrities in the market, so I just want to
###403 make sure I give you some love.
###405 -No problem.
###406 Definitely.
###406 Welcome to Moda404.
###407 BILLY BAD ASS: What are the price points on those up
###409 there?
###410 -$695 for these.
###411 BILLY BAD ASS: Those are like boss glasses right there.
###413 When you wear those, you know you a boss.
###417 What are the price point on these?
###418 -This pair is actually $595, I believe.
###421 BILLY BAD ASS: What's the price point on something like
###422 that?
###422 -This one here is $425.
###425 BILLY BAD ASS: I just met this gentleman named Quincy.
###428 He's got a lot of core urban luxury, and I do
###431 Urban Fashion Week.
###432 This was a great fit.
###435 -Urban luxury, to me, is basically--
###437 the hip hop community, once they make it to a certain
###438 level, then they feel like they have to
###441 dress a certain way.
###442 But you do have those guys that just don't break code.
###445 They still going to wear T-shirts.
###447 They going to jump out of Maserati wearing T-shirts.
###449 They're going to wear Levi's.
###452 But they still going to have $400,000 worth of jewelry on.
###455 It's urban luxury--
###456 what we consider luxury in the hood.
###458 BILLY BAD ASS: Well, listen.
###459 How many shirts you going to give me?
###463 -When people use the term "urban," to be quite honest
###464 with you, I take offense to it.
###466 It's such a stereotype as far as fashion, because fashion to
###469 me is worldwide.
###470 CHARLET DUBOC: Is there anything that's become
###471 fashionable in the Atlanta hip hop community that
###475 you think, oh god.
###477 You don't really like.
###478 -When guys wear their suits with the tag on the sleeve.
###483 And then the butt implants on the ladies' side.
###486 Atlanta is really notorious for their strip club.
###489 And also--
###490 yeah.
###491 It's definitely a show when you go out.
###495 CHARLET DUBOC: Atlanta strip clubs are heavily referenced
###497 in countless hip hop songs, to the extent that stripping has
###501 become a covetable career choice for
###503 young women of Atlanta.
###504 Something to aspire to rather than a last resort, which is
###508 so often the case elsewhere in the world.
###510 -[RAPPING - FUTURE, "MAGIC"]
###519 CHARLET DUBOC: We headed to the Vatican of strip clubs--
###522 Magic City--
###523 to talk to some of the girls about pussy
###525 popping on the handstand.
###526 Oh, and fashion.
###528 
###532 PASSION: My name is Passion.
###534 I just graduated from Alabama State University.
###537 This magnitude of this place helped me fund
###541 my way through school.
###543 This one individual can make thousands of dollars just by
###547 taking off her clothes and nothing else.
###549 She doesn't have to be smart.
###551 All she has to do is bend over and shake her ass for money.
###554 That's freaking crazy.
###556 
###559 CHARLET DUBOC: Stripping is cool in Atlanta.
###561 How did that happen?
###562 PASSION: Big Meech, from Detroit, well, he came in the
###564 clubs and he started this make it rain era.
###568 Rain falling from the ceiling.
###569 And it just looked like it's just trickling down.
###572 CHARLET DUBOC: You mean money?
###573 PASSION: Money, yes!
###573 Money just coming down.
###576 And he made stripping cool.
###578 
###581 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###583 CHARLET DUBOC: Hip hop and strip clubs
###585 feed off each other.
###587 -It's the inspiration both ways.
###590 We inspirate them, I believe, as far as what they rap about.
###594 Strippers poles, money, and all that.
###596 And then we feed off of-- because they come in here and
###598 play their song.
###599 They throw the money.
###599 They actually do what their song is talking about.
###601 So we enjoy each other.
###603 So it's back and forth.
###605 Motivation.
###607 -We still get rappers that talk about Magic City, of
###610 course, in all of their songs.
###613 CHARLET DUBOC: Is the whole style and expression of
###615 stripping filtering down into Atlanta fashion?
###618 PASSION: This club is the most flashiest club you're ever
###621 going to see.
###621 The first time I saw these feathers and these glitter,
###624 glitzy bras and things were inside here.
###627 And now I see women outside of here wearing it, too.
###630 So, yeah.
###630 They are trying to imitate us.
###634 Maybe because they're trying to keep their
###636 men a little longer.
###637
