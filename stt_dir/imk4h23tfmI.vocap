###11 in his name is doctor joseph master apollo and he is a creationist
###16 he believes that uh... scientists have absolutely no proof of that aleutian and
###20 that no scientists can't disprove the literal interpretation of genesis so
###25 he's creating this so-called mini trial
###28 where he will i'd choose all listen potential judges
###32 and the scientists that would adn
###34 debate him
###35 wud agree on one of the judges on the list
###38 and then they would go ahead and debate
###39 and if the scientist wins he gets ten thousand dollars
###45 how okie
