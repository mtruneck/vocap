capital of the world.


5
0:0:17,152 --> 0:0:20,5



6
0:0:20,5 --> 0:0:22,1
Turbofolk is traditional
Yugoslavian folk music played


7
0:0:22,1 --> 0:0:24,27
over some of the most violently
aggressive techno


8
0:0:24,27 --> 0:0:27,81

11
0:0:33,34 --> 0:0:35,83
isn't uncommon for a turbofolk
star to be arrested with a

13
0:0:38,47 --> 0:0:49,71



14
0:0:49,71 --> 0:0:52,7
Turbofolk started in the
roadhouse bars dotting


15
0:0:52,7 --> 0:0:54,69
Serbia's highways before
migrating to the city and


16
0:0:54,69 --> 0:0:58,97

21
0:1:8,92 --> 0:1:56,76



22
0:1:56,76 --> 0:1:58,97
Under Tito, folk music was
deemed too kitschy and


23
0:1:58,97 --> 0:2:1,1
embarrassing for
state support.


24
0:2:1,1 --> 0:2:2,41
So folk singers had
to get their money


25
0:2:2,41 --> 0:2:3,91
from another source--


26
0:2:3,91 --> 0:2:5,931

27
0:2:5,931 --> 0:2:9,1
As Yugoslavia fell apart in the
'90s, gangsters bought up


28
0:2:9,1 --> 0:2:11,58
state assets and even led their
own armies in the wars


29
0:2:11,58 --> 0:2:13,34
with the breakaway republics.


30
0:2:13,34 --> 0:2:16,22
They channeled their plunder
into the music they loved, and


31
0:2:16,22 --> 0:2:18,83
overnight, folk turned from
funny country songs about


32
0:2:18,83 --> 0:2:21,89

Raznatovic,


38
0:2:35,93 --> 0:2:38,42
better known as Ceca.


39
0:2:38,42 --> 0:2:40,57
Ceca's songs became the
soundtrack to the wars in


40
0:2:40,57 --> 0:2:43,55

herself even traveled to the


41

the Serbian soldiers.


42
0:2:46,46 --> 0:2:48,61
On one of these trips, she fell

43

44
0:2:50,83 --> 0:2:52,58
Following the war, the two
were married in a garish


45
0:2:52,58 --> 0:2:56,32
ceremony Serbian newspapers
described as a fairy tale.


46
0:2:56,32 --> 0:2:59,3
The marriage was broadcast on
state TV, sealing Ceca as the


47

and making the marriage of

49

Arkan was killed in 2000, and
three years later, Ceca was
