0:0:22,32 --> 0:0:23,91

0:0:26,85 --> 0:0:27,206

0:0:27,206 --> 0:0:28,53
GREG: That's really

9
0:0:28,53 --> 0:0:29,89
Right, see that Red Lightning?


10
0:0:29,89 --> 0:0:31,353

GREG: This is Grado, Davey.

GRADO: It's Grado.

GREG: Hey, get to that cunt

26
0:0:49,52 --> 0:0:50,23
GRADO: Aye, I will do.


27
0:0:50,23 --> 0:0:51,2
I will do.


28
0:0:51,2 --> 0:0:53,46
This is the Salt Cot where I'm
going to be getting my Grado


29
0:0:53,46 --> 0:0:54,27
hat off my mate.


30
0:0:54,27 --> 0:0:57,38
There's a space to park.


31
0:0:57,38 --> 0:0:57,88
You alright?


32
0:0:57,88 --> 0:0:59,38
MALE SPEAKER: Who's
that in here?


33
0:0:59,38 --> 0:1:0,3
GRADO: I'm a professional
wrestler.


34
0:1:0,3 --> 0:1:1,22
You never heard of me, Grado?


35
0:1:1,22 --> 0:1:3,68
MALE SPEAKER: Come on over,
I want to talk to you.


36
0:1:3,68 --> 0:1:4,916
I hope it's not on
Crimewatch UK.


37
0:1:4,916 --> 0:1:7,38
GRADO: Are you opening
back up the Metro?


38
0:1:7,38 --> 0:1:8,11
MALE SPEAKER: Aye.


39
0:1:8,11 --> 0:1:10,59
GRADO: This is the most popular
nightclub in Ayrshire.


40
0:1:10,59 --> 0:1:11,63
But it's been shut down.


41
0:1:11,63 --> 0:1:13,62
But this guy's gone and opened
it back up, haven't you?


42
0:1:13,62 --> 0:1:15,16
MALE SPEAKER: Cost
me 90 grand.


43
0:1:15,16 --> 0:1:15,7
GRADO: Is that how much it's
going to cost you?


44
0:1:15,7 --> 0:1:17,5
MALE SPEAKER: Aye.


45
0:1:17,5 --> 0:1:19,12
There's a lot of work
to be done inside.


46
0:1:19,12 --> 0:1:21,172
GRADO: Here, you want to put
on a wrestling show when it


47
0:1:21,172 --> 0:1:21,63
opens back up?


48
0:1:21,63 --> 0:1:23,56
MALE SPEAKER: Well, I
can't promise you.


49
0:1:23,56 --> 0:1:25,24
GRADO: I'll come back down
tomorrow morning.


50
0:1:25,24 --> 0:1:25,57
You should be here
tomorrow morning?


51
0:1:25,57 --> 0:1:26,8
MALE SPEAKER: I'm here

52
0:1:26,8 --> 0:1:27,4
GRADO: Ideal mate.


53
0:1:27,4 --> 0:1:28,63
MALE SPEAKER: I've been
here 10 years.


54
0:1:28,63 --> 0:1:29,4
GRADO: 10 years?


55
0:1:29,4 --> 0:1:30,2
MALE SPEAKER: Aye.


56
0:1:30,2 --> 0:1:31,626
GRADO: Right, I'm away

0:1:31,626 --> 0:1:32,68

0:1:32,68 --> 0:1:33,817
GRADO: Am I nervous?


59
0:1:33,817 --> 0:1:37,9
I'm like that.


60
0:1:37,9 --> 0:1:37,7
Check this out.


61
0:1:37,7 --> 0:1:39,29
MALE SPEAKER: That's for
him for later, yeah.


62
0:1:39,29 --> 0:1:40,91
Here, you want to just
take that now?


63
0:1:40,91 --> 0:1:42,15
GRADO: You think I'll
need these?


64
0:1:42,15 --> 0:1:42,5
MALE SPEAKER: Aye.


65
0:1:42,5 --> 0:1:44,45
GRADO: Go shout,
we want Grado.


66
0:1:44,45 --> 0:1:45,641
MALE SPEAKER: No!


67
0:1:45,641 --> 0:1:48,69
GRADO: We want Grado!


68
0:1:48,69 --> 0:1:49,3
Send it.


69
0:1:49,3 --> 0:1:50,74
Let's do this.


70
0:1:50,74 --> 0:1:51,205
I'll see you tonight.


71
0:1:51,205 --> 0:1:51,92
What time are you going
to be there at?


72
0:1:51,92 --> 0:1:53,3
MALE SPEAKER: Hey,
I'm going up at


73
0:1:53,3 --> 0:1:54,11
about four-ish or something.


74
0:1:54,11 --> 0:1:55,905
GRADO: Don't work
too hard, mate.


75
0:1:55,905 --> 0:1:57,36
MALE SPEAKER: See you later.


76
0:1:57,36 --> 0:1:58,61
GRADO: See your later.


77
0:1:58,61 --> 0:2:3,18



78
0:2:3,18 --> 0:2:5,69
My girlfriend thinks that
I think that I'm famous.


79
0:2:5,69 --> 0:2:7,46
She's always like, just because
you've put up a couple


80
0:2:7,46 --> 0:2:9,65
of YouTube videos doesn't mean
you say you're the man.


81
0:2:9,65 --> 0:2:10,3
You think you're famous.


82
0:2:10,3 --> 0:2:11,75
'Cause I'll say to her listen,
honey, I'm a Z-lister.


83
0:2:11,75 --> 0:2:13,41
I'm a Z-list celebrity,
by the way.


84
0:2:13,41 --> 0:2:14,9
You know what I mean?


85
0:2:14,9 --> 0:2:17,5
She's like all right,
give us a break.


86
0:2:17,5 --> 0:2:18,14
My girlfriend doesn't
even tell her


87
0:2:18,14 --> 0:2:20,1
family that I do wrestling.


88
0:2:20,1 --> 0:2:21,27
She was that affronted.


89
0:2:21,27 --> 0:2:23,2
She was embarrassed,
mortified.


90
0:2:23,2 --> 0:2:26,23
She just doesn't like the idea
of me in a leotard, jumping


91
0:2:26,23 --> 0:2:27,57
about and kidding and fighting,


92
0:2:27,57 --> 0:2:28,46
which is fair enough.


93
0:2:28,46 --> 0:2:29,71
She hates wrestling.


94
0:2:29,71 --> 0:2:35,71



95
0:2:35,71 --> 0:2:38,305
See, going to Glasgow is like
going into London for me, do


96
0:2:38,305 --> 0:2:38,48
you what I mean?


97
0:2:38,48 --> 0:2:39,275
This is like--


98
0:2:39,275 --> 0:2:40,78
I mean, look at Glasgow
now, man.


99
0:2:40,78 --> 0:2:43,82
It's like still a buzz for
me to go into Glasgow.


100
0:2:43,82 --> 0:2:46,8
A lot of folk will think it's
so stupid man, it's Glasgow.


101
0:2:46,8 --> 0:2:49,9
But because I live next to the
sea and live in a wee kind of


102
0:2:49,9 --> 0:2:52,21
seaside town, you come into
Glasgow, man, it's still a bit


103
0:2:52,21 --> 0:2:54,338
of a buzz, do you know
what I mean?


104
0:2:54,338 --> 0:2:55,588
It's a bit of a buzz.


105
0:2:55,588 --> 0:3:2,958



106
0:3:2,958 --> 0:3:4,47
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well,
it's Mark Dallas'


107
0:3:4,47 --> 0:3:5,803
birthday, good friends.


108
0:3:5,803 --> 0:3:8,422
FEMALE SPEAKER: So everyone's
going to get really fucked up.


109
0:3:8,422 --> 0:3:12,706



110
0:3:12,706 --> 0:3:15,74
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm the manager
of Mikey Whiplash.


111
0:3:15,74 --> 0:3:17,79
FEMALE SPEAKER: She's also a
valet, so she comes on and


112
0:3:17,79 --> 0:3:18,69
gets dirty.


113
0:3:18,69 --> 0:3:20,48
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
just her fan.


114
0:3:20,48 --> 0:3:22,46
I'm the fluffer.


115
0:3:22,46 --> 0:3:25,93
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
fluffing.


116
0:3:25,93 --> 0:3:29,5
Here is real, the blood is real,
the pain is real, the


117
0:3:29,5 --> 0:3:31,865
sexy bits are real, it's
making it for real.


118
0:3:31,865 --> 0:3:33,691
FEMALE SPEAKER: Buckfast,
cider and blood.


119
0:3:33,691 --> 0:3:34,178
FEMALE SPEAKER: And balls.


120
0:3:34,178 --> 0:3:35,152
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, well.


121
0:3:35,152 --> 0:3:36,613
FEMALE SPEAKER: All
about the balls.


122
0:3:36,613 --> 0:3:37,1
FEMALE SPEAKER: And boobs.


123
0:3:37,1 --> 0:3:37,587
Boobs.


124
0:3:37,587 --> 0:3:39,535
FEMALE SPEAKER: Balls
and boobs.


125
0:3:39,535 --> 0:3:42,944
FEMALE SPEAKER: I like this.


126
0:3:42,944 --> 0:3:45,38
FEMALE SPEAKER: ICW attracts
the most crazy and the most


127
0:3:45,38 --> 0:3:48,74
daring and individual
of talents.


128
0:3:48,74 --> 0:3:51,355
And we all get together and get
sexy and kick the fuck out


129
0:3:51,355 --> 0:3:51,61
of each other.


130
0:3:51,61 --> 0:3:53,1
FEMALE SPEAKER: Why you rubbing
my back when you could


131
0:3:53,1 --> 0:3:54,26
be rubbing my tits?


132
0:3:54,26 --> 0:3:56,11



133
0:3:56,11 --> 0:3:57,56
DAVEY BOY: My name
is Davey Boy.


134
0:3:57,56 --> 0:3:58,76
WEE MAN: My name's Wee Man.


135
0:3:58,76 --> 0:3:59,8
STEVIE BOY: Stevie Boy.


136
0:3:59,8 --> 0:4:2,73
DAVEY BOY: And together
we are The Bucky Boys.


137
0:4:2,73 --> 0:4:5,81
The gimmick is, we're a couple
of hard NEDs, a couple of


138
0:4:5,81 --> 0:4:7,32
cheeky bastards from Glasgow.


139
0:4:7,32 --> 0:4:10,3
A NED is a Non-Educated
Delinquent.


140
0:4:10,3 --> 0:4:11,77
Say, somebody that doesn't
really pay


141
0:4:11,77 --> 0:4:13,39
attention in school.


142
0:4:13,39 --> 0:4:15,79
He more or less gets stoned,
fights a lot at


143
0:4:15,79 --> 0:4:17,63
weekends, gets jailed.


144
0:4:17,63 --> 0:4:20,13
Just basically breaches the
peace, causes trouble.


145
0:4:20,13 --> 0:4:22,15
STEVIE BOY: We've got
the Wee Man and all.


146
0:4:22,15 --> 0:4:23,842
DAVEY BOY: This is the guy that
started to do it, do you


147
0:4:23,842 --> 0:4:24,2
know what I mean?


148
0:4:24,2 --> 0:4:26,1
Like, singing his wee songs.


149
0:4:26,1 --> 0:4:28,18
I loved them, they
were amazing.


150
0:4:28,18 --> 0:4:30,39
I used to sit there on MSN
like, oh, fucking look


151
0:4:30,39 --> 0:4:31,27
at this cunt, man.


152
0:4:31,27 --> 0:4:32,52
This video's amazing.


153
0:4:32,52 --> 0:4:39,31



154
0:4:39,31 --> 0:4:40,18
DAVEY BOY: Oh, it
was brilliant.


155
0:4:40,18 --> 0:4:42,39
Honest to God, one of the
best guys to manage.


156
0:4:42,39 --> 0:4:46,9
WEE MAN: The Buckfast
is a fortified wine.


157
0:4:46,9 --> 0:4:49,27
I think because it's so highly
caffeinated, that's why the


158
0:4:49,27 --> 0:4:50,1
folk drink it.


159
0:4:50,1 --> 0:4:50,96
STEVIE BOY: It's the "wreck
the house" juice.


160
0:4:50,96 --> 0:4:53,83
WEE MAN: So not only does it get
you steaming, but it gets


161
0:4:53,83 --> 0:4:54,35
you hyper as well.


162
0:4:54,35 --> 0:4:56,5
DAVEY BOY: It's a very
well-known drink in Glasgow.


163
0:4:56,5 --> 0:4:58,78
A lot of your junkies,
your alkies, your


164
0:4:58,78 --> 0:5:0,27
NEDs, they drink it.


165
0:5:0,27 --> 0:5:3,9
So Dallas decided because that
was our gimmick with the NEDs,


166
0:5:3,9 --> 0:5:6,1
he says you'll be called
The Bucky Boys.


167
0:5:6,1 --> 0:5:8,57
And we come out with a box of
Bucky, we drink it, we get mad


168
0:5:8,57 --> 0:5:10,13
with it while we wrestle,
and that is the


169
0:5:10,13 --> 0:5:12,88
best part about it.


170
0:5:12,88 --> 0:5:14,85
WEE MAN: Well, I read somewhere
that even though


171
0:5:14,85 --> 0:5:17,91
it's brewed by Benedictine monks
in Buckfast Abbey in


172
0:5:17,91 --> 0:5:22,936
Devon, England, about 80% or
85% gets sent to Scotland.


173
0:5:22,936 --> 0:5:26,6
They should be praying
to us, not God.


174
0:5:26,6 --> 0:5:27,6
You do get groupies.


175
0:5:27,6 --> 0:5:30,8
DAVEY BOY: "Ring rats," is the
Glasgow version for it.


176
0:5:30,8 --> 0:5:33,8
Quasiomos, Sloths,
you name it.


177
0:5:33,8 --> 0:5:34,11
WEE MAN: They're not so much
belles of the ball as those


178
0:5:34,11 --> 0:5:34,98
that ring the bells.


179
0:5:34,98 --> 0:5:38,9
DAVEY BOY: Ring rats
sometimes get done.


180
0:5:38,9 --> 0:5:42,67



181
0:5:42,67 --> 0:5:44,55
It's like Sauchiehall
Street, down there.


182
0:5:44,55 --> 0:5:47,556
Right, this place is packing
with clunge.


183
0:5:47,556 --> 0:5:49,5
It's amazing.


184
0:5:49,5 --> 0:5:50,5
We're the Bucky Boys,
that's why we're all


185
0:5:50,5 --> 0:5:51,38
dressed like NEDs.


186
0:5:51,38 --> 0:5:52,306
And we're playing there
tomorrow night.


187
0:5:52,306 --> 0:5:52,682
FEMALE SPEAKER: Really?


188
0:5:52,682 --> 0:5:53,6
DAVEY BOY: Aye.


189
0:5:53,6 --> 0:5:55,8
We're going to go for a drink
if you want to come with.


190
0:5:55,8 --> 0:5:56,205
FEMALE SPEAKER: Uh huh.


191
0:5:56,205 --> 0:5:57,15
FEMALE SPEAKER: Where
are you going?


192
0:5:57,15 --> 0:5:59,5
DAVEY BOY: Anywhere we can
get in with trackies.


193
0:5:59,5 --> 0:6:1,44
STEVIE BOY: This is how
you pull in Glasgow.


194
0:6:1,44 --> 0:6:3,75
Tell lassies to go out and see
your poster and then you slip


195
0:6:3,75 --> 0:6:5,72
a pill in their drink,
and fuck on.


196
0:6:5,72 --> 0:6:8,51
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, have
you got that on camera?


197
0:6:8,51 --> 0:6:11,252
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


198
0:6:11,252 --> 0:6:13,31
DAVEY BOY: Yeah, they'll
fucking believe us now.


199
0:6:13,31 --> 0:6:14,165
There you go, look at that.


200
0:6:14,165 --> 0:6:15,54
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's you!


201
0:6:15,54 --> 0:6:16,44
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's you?


202
0:6:16,44 --> 0:6:18,24
That's actually pretty
good though.


203
0:6:18,24 --> 0:6:19,142
DAVEY BOY: Have you
got Facebook?


204
0:6:19,142 --> 0:6:20,106
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


205
0:6:20,106 --> 0:6:21,7
Hey, what's your name though?


206
0:6:21,7 --> 0:6:21,552
I'll add you right now.


207
0:6:21,552 --> 0:6:22,772
FEMALE SPEAKER: Will you
take our names down


208
0:6:22,772 --> 0:6:23,74
and we'll add you?


209
0:6:23,74 --> 0:6:25,204
Thank you!


210
0:6:25,204 --> 0:6:27,65
Bye!


211
0:6:27,65 --> 0:6:27,995
STEVIE BOY: Oh yes.


212
0:6:27,995 --> 0:6:29,33
DAVEY BOY: My boys
grow up so fast.


213
0:6:29,33 --> 0:6:31,97
I'm going to fucking
shag one of them.


214
0:6:31,97 --> 0:6:33,65
Oof!


215
0:6:33,65 --> 0:6:36,8
Yeah, wrestling's
fake alright.


216
0:6:36,8 --> 0:6:41,25
We represent coming out, having
a laugh, smashing


217
0:6:41,25 --> 0:6:43,79
people's heads in,
getting drunk.


218
0:6:43,79 --> 0:6:45,28
I think a lot of people
are like that.


219
0:6:45,28 --> 0:6:47,9
So I think that's why when we
come out, everybody loves us.


220
0:6:47,9 --> 0:6:49,65
STEVIE BOY: I don't care who
you are, what you say, what


221
0:6:49,65 --> 0:6:51,44
your background is, everybody
was a NED at one point.


222
0:6:51,44 --> 0:6:55,1
You hung out at the park, you
smoked dope, you drink.


223
0:6:55,1 --> 0:6:56,85
You had a good time with your
pals, you had a laugh.


224
0:6:56,85 --> 0:6:58,72
I think it just kind
of brings back


225
0:6:58,72 --> 0:6:59,89
those memories to everybody.


226
0:6:59,89 --> 0:7:2,51
Before you went into your
working life and you were


227
0:7:2,51 --> 0:7:4,205
working the 9-5, just
doing the same


228
0:7:4,205 --> 0:7:5,32
mundane piss every day.


229
0:7:5,32 --> 0:7:7,2
All my family were NEDs,
my brothers and


230
0:7:7,2 --> 0:7:8,19
that were all NEDs.


231
0:7:8,19 --> 0:7:10,21
A training center opened
up literally two


232
0:7:10,21 --> 0:7:10,94
minutes from my door.


233
0:7:10,94 --> 0:7:13,14
And it just kind of gave
me something to


234
0:7:13,14 --> 0:7:14,15
channel myself into.


235
0:7:14,15 --> 0:7:17,46
When all my pals were at house
parties, getting steaming and


236
0:7:17,46 --> 0:7:19,815
pumping bods and all that,
I was traveling up


237
0:7:19,815 --> 0:7:20,75
and down the country.


238
0:7:20,75 --> 0:7:22,78
You hear your name getting
called, then all of a sudden


239
0:7:22,78 --> 0:7:23,73
the roof just comes
off the place.


240
0:7:23,73 --> 0:7:26,6
And you walk out there and you
know that every single person


241
0:7:26,6 --> 0:7:28,24
in there's paid a tenner to come
and see you do what you


242
0:7:28,24 --> 0:7:28,66
love doing.


243
0:7:28,66 --> 0:7:30,1
I don't know, it's weird.


244
0:7:30,1 --> 0:7:32,0
It's like you walk out in front
of that crowd and I'm


245
0:7:32,0 --> 0:7:33,85
not just that boy that
came from Paisley,


246
0:7:33,85 --> 0:7:34,85
I'm not just a nobody.


247
0:7:34,85 --> 0:7:37,9
I'm literally a superstar,
if you will.


248
0:7:37,9 --> 0:7:39,96
I'm actually living my dream
for that 10-15 minutes.


249
0:7:39,96 --> 0:7:43,89
But wrestling definitely gets
a bad name for all the drink


250
0:7:43,89 --> 0:7:44,67
and drugs and all that.


251
0:7:44,67 --> 0:7:48,335
But from my personal point of
view, it literally saved me


252
0:7:48,335 --> 0:7:50,29
from what would have been.


253
0:7:50,29 --> 0:9:50,29
