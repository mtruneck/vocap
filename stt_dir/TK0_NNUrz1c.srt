[MUSIC PLAYING]


2
0:0:10,18 --> 0:0:15,32



3
0:0:15,32 --> 0:0:17,44
AUREL SCHMIDT: My name's
Aurel Schmidt.


4
0:0:17,44 --> 0:0:21,26
I'm from Kamloops, BC, British
Columbia, Canada.


5
0:0:21,26 --> 0:0:22,98
INTERVIEWER: How long have you
lived in New York now?


6
0:0:22,98 --> 0:0:27,24



7
0:0:27,24 --> 0:0:28,65
AUREL SCHMIDT: Three
years in April.


8
0:0:28,65 --> 0:0:30,32
INTERVIEWER: How do you think
that this city has


9
0:0:30,32 --> 0:0:32,25
affected your work?


10
0:0:32,25 --> 0:0:33,92
AUREL SCHMIDT: So the work
changed with the city,


11
0:0:33,92 --> 0:0:34,5
definitely.


12
0:0:34,5 --> 0:0:39,27
Like, all of the garbage rat,
decay stuff started coming in


13
0:0:39,27 --> 0:0:40,85
when I moved here.


14
0:0:40,85 --> 0:0:41,875
Everyone's fighting for space.


15
0:0:41,875 --> 0:0:43,69
There's like--


16
0:0:43,69 --> 0:0:45,56
there's no room for emptiness.


17
0:0:45,56 --> 0:0:49,832
There's always noise or
background noise, you know?


18
0:0:49,832 --> 0:0:53,9
So I think the pieces started
getting filled with the


19
0:0:53,9 --> 0:0:54,41
clutter of a city in a way.


20
0:0:54,41 --> 0:0:55,84
I moved here.


21
0:0:55,84 --> 0:0:59,14
I was extremely lonely
and paranoid.


22
0:0:59,14 --> 0:1:1,89
And doing, like, a lot of drugs
for some reason as well


23
0:1:1,89 --> 0:1:3,64
as those things, so it was
like this really intense,


24
0:1:3,64 --> 0:1:8,18
like, paranoid, lonely state,
which I think then I put a lot


25
0:1:8,18 --> 0:1:9,77
of it into the work.


26
0:1:9,77 --> 0:1:13,44
Because it was a way to deal
with those paranoias and


27
0:1:13,44 --> 0:1:16,4
feelings and the things you see
out of the corner of your


28
0:1:16,4 --> 0:1:17,6
eye, you know?


29
0:1:17,6 --> 0:1:18,49
When you're paranoid, you're
like, oh my god,


30
0:1:18,49 --> 0:1:19,89
is that a dead body?


31
0:1:19,89 --> 0:1:20,77
Oh, it's a pile of garbage.


32
0:1:20,77 --> 0:1:22,77
Like, don't worry, calm down.


33
0:1:22,77 --> 0:1:23,465
Everything's OK.


34
0:1:23,465 --> 0:1:25,53
The world's not out
to kill you.


35
0:1:25,53 --> 0:1:28,12
INTERVIEWER: I mean, it's
very beautiful.


36
0:1:28,12 --> 0:1:32,73
But it's definitely shocking
when you get up close and see


37
0:1:32,73 --> 0:1:38,29
all the different bodies
and decay.


38
0:1:38,29 --> 0:1:42,21
AUREL SCHMIDT: The rats, the
maggots, the cigarette butts,


39
0:1:42,21 --> 0:1:44,49
the flies are all the same
symbol, basically.


40
0:1:44,49 --> 0:1:47,54
And it's like old Dutch
[INAUDIBLE] painting would use


41
0:1:47,54 --> 0:1:50,48
the same thing or a
Vanitas painting.


42
0:1:50,48 --> 0:1:52,63
But it's also just a metaphor
for the real world.


43
0:1:52,63 --> 0:1:54,54
It's just that everything
beautiful dies.


44
0:1:54,54 --> 0:1:55,47
There is decay.


45
0:1:55,47 --> 0:1:56,15
There's renewal.


46
0:1:56,15 --> 0:2:0,89
But there are symbols of death
and decay, which is also in a


47
0:2:0,89 --> 0:2:3,28
way a symbol of inner--


48
0:2:3,28 --> 0:2:7,8
like for me, I have a lot of
anxiety and bad thoughts.


49
0:2:7,8 --> 0:2:11,45
And I think that it's also
a symbol of that.


50
0:2:11,45 --> 0:2:16,21
Like the underlying says
things are good.


51
0:2:16,21 --> 0:2:17,66
But no, things are bad.


52
0:2:17,66 --> 0:2:20,3
There's this badness
to everything, or


53
0:2:20,3 --> 0:2:22,91
like a sense of--


54
0:2:22,91 --> 0:2:24,115
yeah, like a doom and a badness


55
0:2:24,115 --> 0:2:27,4
to all things sometimes.


56
0:2:27,4 --> 0:2:29,77
And those are just symbols that
symbolize that without


57
0:2:29,77 --> 0:2:33,79
having to draw Iraqis getting
their heads blown off.


58
0:2:33,79 --> 0:2:37,59
I mean, that's like a way to
kind of just for me to think


59
0:2:37,59 --> 0:2:42,25
about those ideas, and they
become just symbols for me.


60
0:2:42,25 --> 0:2:47,52
They're the tools to
make a drawing now.


61
0:2:47,52 --> 0:2:49,61
I think only 12 drawings
in it.


62
0:2:49,61 --> 0:2:51,13
But they're full page.


63
0:2:51,13 --> 0:2:56,7
The drawings came first, and
Tim Barber at Tiny Vices


64
0:2:56,7 --> 0:2:57,7
wanted to do a book.


65
0:2:57,7 --> 0:2:59,13
And I think the burnout
project's kind of over now.


66
0:2:59,13 --> 0:3:3,36
They're like, I think that I'm
done with the burnouts.


67
0:3:3,36 --> 0:3:3,86
INTERVIEWER: OK.


68
0:3:3,86 --> 0:3:5,7
AUREL SCHMIDT: I think.


69
0:3:5,7 --> 0:3:7,94
INTERVIEWER: Because you're
self-taught, do you ever come


70
0:3:7,94 --> 0:3:11,56
up with problems that you
encounter, where you think of


71
0:3:11,56 --> 0:3:14,4
an idea and you just have to
figure out how to make it, or


72
0:3:14,4 --> 0:3:15,73
you're not sure how you
want to make it?


73
0:3:15,73 --> 0:3:18,73
Or how do you get over
those barriers?


74
0:3:18,73 --> 0:3:20,88
AUREL SCHMIDT: I feel like it's
a huge barrier, and I


75
0:3:20,88 --> 0:3:24,59
feel like I'm dealing
with it every day.


76
0:3:24,59 --> 0:3:26,94
If I looked at what I would
want to be as an artist, I


77
0:3:26,94 --> 0:3:28,1
don't want to be a drawer.


78
0:3:28,1 --> 0:3:29,35
I don't want to be a drawer.


79
0:3:29,35 --> 0:3:30,74
I want to be an artist.


80
0:3:30,74 --> 0:3:35,51
I want to be someone who has
ideas and figures out, yeah,


81
0:3:35,51 --> 0:3:38,56
how to make the idea
of the show.


82
0:3:38,56 --> 0:3:40,74
Yeah, I want to make a bunch
of things right now.


83
0:3:40,74 --> 0:3:44,36
I have no idea how to do it,
how to even experiment.


84
0:3:44,36 --> 0:3:48,67
I have no idea what
medium to use.


85
0:3:48,67 --> 0:3:51,52
And how I'm learning is just
going to other people's art


86
0:3:51,52 --> 0:3:54,73
shows, going up to Chelsea and
be like, wow, this culture is


87
0:3:54,73 --> 0:3:58,0
made of bronze and wax, or
blah, blah, blah, blah.


88
0:3:58,0 --> 0:4:3,14
OK, That's materials, like I can
use those materials maybe.


89
0:4:3,14 --> 0:4:6,45
I think most good work I've
ever made comes from not


90
0:4:6,45 --> 0:4:9,63
knowing what I'm doing, figuring
it out, and then the


91
0:4:9,63 --> 0:4:11,31
kind of surprises that
come from that


92
0:4:11,31 --> 0:4:12,79
becoming the real work.


93
0:4:12,79 --> 0:4:15,75
I think the new things I'm going
to start making, like


94
0:4:15,75 --> 0:4:18,125
with sculptures, say, is
going to be crazy.


95
0:4:18,125 --> 0:4:22,1
It's probably going to be crying
and freaking out, and


96
0:4:22,1 --> 0:4:25,73
being really happy, and throwing
tons of stuff away,


97
0:4:25,73 --> 0:4:27,98
and figuring it out,
but that's fine.


98
0:4:27,98 --> 0:4:29,94
INTERVIEWER: What do you
think about people


99
0:4:29,94 --> 0:4:31,57
collecting the work?


100
0:4:31,57 --> 0:4:34,7
Your work was bought by some
really big collectors, by


101
0:4:34,7 --> 0:4:37,37
Sachi and other people
when you first


102
0:4:37,37 --> 0:4:38,97
started showing, right?


103
0:4:38,97 --> 0:4:43,48
Do you feel like that has
influenced your work at all?


104
0:4:43,48 --> 0:4:46,0
AUREL SCHMIDT: I think
that it's probably--


105
0:4:46,0 --> 0:4:49,24
I think actually it's a
really amazing thing.


106
0:4:49,24 --> 0:4:53,55
Those big collectors, they put
it into a collection where it


107
0:4:53,55 --> 0:4:55,77
will go into other
exhibitions.


108
0:4:55,77 --> 0:4:57,35
It's for galleries.


109
0:4:57,35 --> 0:4:58,975
Those kind of collectors, they
don't put it above their


110
0:4:58,975 --> 0:5:1,37
couch, which I think
is really important


111
0:5:1,37 --> 0:5:2,96
for me to think freely.


112
0:5:2,96 --> 0:5:6,95
It frees me to make work
as gross as I want, as


113
0:5:6,95 --> 0:5:8,39
self-revealing as I want.


114
0:5:8,39 --> 0:5:10,75
I'm not like, oh, people
like buying colors.


115
0:5:10,75 --> 0:5:11,97
I should add more colors.


116
0:5:11,97 --> 0:5:14,33
Or how am I going
to pay the rent?


117
0:5:14,33 --> 0:5:17,5
I know people love those animal
drawings, you know?


118
0:5:17,5 --> 0:5:19,36
It's like I can now do
whatever I want.


119
0:5:19,36 --> 0:5:21,65
And if they do or don't like
it, doesn't matter.


120
0:5:21,65 --> 0:5:24,33
INTERVIEWER: I would think that
it would kind of make you


121
0:5:24,33 --> 0:5:29,11
feel more secure about making
the decision to be an artist.


122
0:5:29,11 --> 0:5:30,61
AUREL SCHMIDT: I feel like it
was less of a decision and


123
0:5:30,61 --> 0:5:32,618
more of just something
that happened.


124
0:5:32,618 --> 0:5:35,45
And the fact that right away
those collectors did buy the


125
0:5:35,45 --> 0:5:40,27
work, it was like, wow, this
stuff I make anyway is just


126
0:5:40,27 --> 0:5:42,32
sold to someone good.


127
0:5:42,32 --> 0:5:43,1
And wow.


128
0:5:43,1 --> 0:5:45,55
So it's almost like that, those
things define the fact


129
0:5:45,55 --> 0:5:47,95
that I'm an artist as a
career, whatever, now.


130
0:5:47,95 --> 0:5:48,26
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.


131
0:5:48,26 --> 0:5:52,8
AUREL SCHMIDT: Before I would
have just been making art, but


132
0:5:52,8 --> 0:5:54,49
not necessarily like this is my
career choice or something.


133
0:5:54,49 --> 0:7:54,49
