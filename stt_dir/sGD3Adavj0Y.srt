2
0:0:0,35 --> 0:0:2,18
STEVE: What do you get when you
mix Mentos, Diet Coke, a


3
0:0:2,18 --> 0:0:5,98
skateboard, 150 teachers in
Oklahoma City, in an area


4
0:0:5,98 --> 0:0:9,4
that's riddled by tornadoes?


5
0:0:9,4 --> 0:0:10,5
I don't know, but we
did it anyway.


6
0:0:10,5 --> 0:0:13,4



7
0:0:13,4 --> 0:0:16,305
I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all
about making science fun.


8
0:0:16,305 --> 0:0:19,33
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


9
0:0:19,33 --> 0:0:22,35
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


10
0:0:22,35 --> 0:0:23,37
experiences.


11
0:0:23,37 --> 0:0:26,0
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


12
0:0:26,0 --> 0:0:28,77
affect the way people
think about science.


13
0:0:28,77 --> 0:0:31,3
And to do that I live
by one motto.


14
0:0:31,3 --> 0:0:34,45
Make it big, do it right,
give it class.


15
0:0:34,45 --> 0:0:39,16



16
0:0:39,16 --> 0:0:41,81
Well, if you've never seen the
Mentos and Diet Coke reaction,


17
0:0:41,81 --> 0:0:43,72
where have you been living
all this time?


18
0:0:43,72 --> 0:0:44,65
It's OK.


19
0:0:44,65 --> 0:0:46,62
I'll give you a 20-second
crash course.


20
0:0:46,62 --> 0:0:47,11
Go.


21
0:0:47,11 --> 0:0:50,7
Soda by its very nature is
packed with carbon dioxide and


22
0:0:50,7 --> 0:0:52,18
it wants to come out when
you open up the cap.


23
0:0:52,18 --> 0:0:54,78
In fact, anything you drop
inside will help that


24
0:0:54,78 --> 0:0:55,94
carbonation come out.


25
0:0:55,94 --> 0:0:59,1
Mentos have tiny little pits
or craters on the outside.


26
0:0:59,1 --> 0:1:0,69
They're called nucleation
points.


27
0:1:0,69 --> 0:1:2,23
It's the perfect place
for carbon


28
0:1:2,23 --> 0:1:3,75
dioxide bubbles to gather.


29
0:1:3,75 --> 0:1:6,12
Because they're so heavy, when
you turn it over and drop it


30
0:1:6,12 --> 0:1:8,7
down inside, they fall to the
bottom, the carbon dioxide is


31
0:1:8,7 --> 0:1:11,272
released, and you get
the perfect geyser.


32
0:1:11,272 --> 0:1:12,522
Watch.


33
0:1:12,522 --> 0:1:15,43



34
0:1:15,43 --> 0:1:16,48
See?


35
0:1:16,48 --> 0:1:17,72
It's perfect.


36
0:1:17,72 --> 0:1:20,27
We have to thank Lee Marek, a
chemistry teacher-- not only a


37
0:1:20,27 --> 0:1:21,86
chemistry teacher, a great
chemistry teacher-- from


38
0:1:21,86 --> 0:1:25,175
Naperville, Illinois, who shared
at a conference that if


39
0:1:25,175 --> 0:1:28,5
you happen to use Mentos, it was
a nice substitute for the


40
0:1:28,5 --> 0:1:29,38
Life Savers.


41
0:1:29,38 --> 0:1:30,4
So that's it.


42
0:1:30,4 --> 0:1:32,9
That's how the Mentos started.


43
0:1:32,9 --> 0:1:33,92
I can tell you that nobody
really cared for


44
0:1:33,92 --> 0:1:35,53
a long, long time.


45
0:1:35,53 --> 0:1:39,97
It wasn't until September
of 2005, the lovely Kim


46
0:1:39,97 --> 0:1:43,39
Christensen, was in the backyard
at KUSA 9 News, when


47
0:1:43,39 --> 0:1:46,805
she happened to get a little
soaked because she didn't move


48
0:1:46,805 --> 0:1:47,5
out of the way.


49
0:1:47,5 --> 0:1:48,865
Watch this.


50
0:1:48,865 --> 0:1:50,23
Three, two, one, pull.


51
0:1:50,23 --> 0:1:53,67



52
0:1:53,67 --> 0:1:56,135
Tell me that that's
not awesome?


53
0:1:56,135 --> 0:1:56,549
KIM CHRISTENSEN: I did get it.


54
0:1:56,549 --> 0:1:56,87
That's awesome.


55
0:1:56,87 --> 0:1:57,65
STEVE: So sorry.


56
0:1:57,65 --> 0:1:58,442
KIM CHRISTENSEN: That's OK.


57
0:1:58,442 --> 0:1:59,34
STEVE: Look at you, you are--


58
0:1:59,34 --> 0:2:0,54
KIM CHRISTENSEN: It tastes
kind of good.


59
0:2:0,54 --> 0:2:1,14
STEVE: Wasn't that fun?


60
0:2:1,14 --> 0:2:2,1
KIM CHRISTENSEN: Yeah,
it was fun.


61
0:2:2,1 --> 0:2:5,59
STEVE: That is the best
I have ever seen.


62
0:2:5,59 --> 0:2:7,48
Although this little test
tube, called a baby soda


63
0:2:7,48 --> 0:2:11,19
bottle, was a great dropping
device for it, this created a


64
0:2:11,19 --> 0:2:13,3
problem and that was
not everybody


65
0:2:13,3 --> 0:2:14,46
could drop them equally.


66
0:2:14,46 --> 0:2:17,11
And when a producer from
Discovery Channel called, that


67
0:2:17,11 --> 0:2:20,41
happened to work on a little
show called MythBusters, they


68
0:2:20,41 --> 0:2:23,5
said we'd seen your thing with
Kim Christensen, and saw that


69
0:2:23,5 --> 0:2:26,3
it went up 18 feet, how do
you make it go higher?


70
0:2:26,3 --> 0:2:28,31
Well, there are a whole bunch
of different ways to look at


71
0:2:28,31 --> 0:2:31,5
it, but that prompted me to
start thinking about a dropper


72
0:2:31,5 --> 0:2:33,9
device that would allow
everybody to drop equally.


73
0:2:33,9 --> 0:2:36,56
This was a device my
wife had purchased.


74
0:2:36,56 --> 0:2:39,63
It was almost like PVC, but it
made this hamper for the dirty


75
0:2:39,63 --> 0:2:43,15
clothes, and as I looked at that
pipe, I thought that's


76
0:2:43,15 --> 0:2:45,9
probably about the size of the
opening of a two-liter bottle.


77
0:2:45,9 --> 0:2:47,54
Well, lo and behold, it was.


78
0:2:47,54 --> 0:2:50,11
It fit perfectly.


79
0:2:50,11 --> 0:2:52,13
Now if there was just a way
to be able to attach it.


80
0:2:52,13 --> 0:2:54,85
So this is where the two-liter
cap came in-- a regular


81
0:2:54,85 --> 0:2:57,82
two-liter cap-- and this went
down inside like this.


82
0:2:57,82 --> 0:3:1,58
And so now we had a way to be
able to secure this in place,


83
0:3:1,58 --> 0:3:5,4
which was perfect, so this could
go on here like this.


84
0:3:5,4 --> 0:3:8,22
And this was the first dropper
device for the


85
0:3:8,22 --> 0:3:11,5
Mentos geyser reaction.


86
0:3:11,5 --> 0:3:13,45
More pressure, that's
what I wanted.


87
0:3:13,45 --> 0:3:14,72
I wanted it to go higher.


88
0:3:14,72 --> 0:3:17,2
It should go 35 or 40
feet in the air.


89
0:3:17,2 --> 0:3:19,43
It just needed to build up
more pressure, and that's


90
0:3:19,43 --> 0:3:21,8
where this little device
saved the day.


91
0:3:21,8 --> 0:3:23,48
It's basically the same idea.


92
0:3:23,48 --> 0:3:25,53
It's just that there's no holes
on the side because


93
0:3:25,53 --> 0:3:28,6
there's a new little dropping
mechanism, and you only have


94
0:3:28,6 --> 0:3:32,23
to use three or four Mentos to
get almost 35 feet in height


95
0:3:32,23 --> 0:3:34,0
as the geyser blasts off.


96
0:3:34,0 --> 0:3:36,45
This screws onto the
top, and now your


97
0:3:36,45 --> 0:3:37,82
geyser is ready to go.


98
0:3:37,82 --> 0:3:40,8
But it's even better,
because watch this.


99
0:3:40,8 --> 0:3:42,96
I can actually take the Mentos
after the reaction has taken


100
0:3:42,96 --> 0:3:46,37
place and now collect them back
in the geyser tube, seal


101
0:3:46,37 --> 0:3:47,89
it up, twist it off.


102
0:3:47,89 --> 0:3:49,59
Even though they're wet,
the nucleation


103
0:3:49,59 --> 0:3:51,15
points are still perfect.


104
0:3:51,15 --> 0:3:53,98
This twists onto a new bottle,
and I get another reaction


105
0:3:53,98 --> 0:3:56,25
using the same Mentos.


106
0:3:56,25 --> 0:3:59,5
The next issue isn't a design
issue, it's really an


107
0:3:59,5 --> 0:4:2,19
experimental issue, and that is
thousands upon thousands of


108
0:4:2,19 --> 0:4:5,3
you have done this reaction, how
high does the geyser go?


109
0:4:5,3 --> 0:4:6,92
That seems to be the
bragging point.


110
0:4:6,92 --> 0:4:10,2
Well, little did I know that
I could solve that problem


111
0:4:10,2 --> 0:4:12,7
simply by taking this
whole thing and


112
0:4:12,7 --> 0:4:14,13
turning it 90 degrees.


113
0:4:14,13 --> 0:4:15,54
In comes the skateboard.


114
0:4:15,54 --> 0:4:18,1
Because all I have to do now
is to take the bottle and


115
0:4:18,1 --> 0:4:19,93
attach it to the keyboard.


116
0:4:19,93 --> 0:4:22,57
That's where we need
duct tape.


117
0:4:22,57 --> 0:4:24,25
See, I have my kids.


118
0:4:24,25 --> 0:4:26,9
I just put them on the
skateboard and make them hold


119
0:4:26,9 --> 0:4:28,49
the Diet Coke.


120
0:4:28,49 --> 0:4:30,66
Drop the Mentos in and the Diet
Coke and the kids and the


121
0:4:30,66 --> 0:4:34,6
Mentos, but then my wife said,
that's not a good idea.


122
0:4:34,6 --> 0:4:42,45
That's where this solution
was perfect.


123
0:4:42,45 --> 0:4:43,41
All right, we've got a flat
surface, we've got a


124
0:4:43,41 --> 0:4:44,48
skateboard, Mentos.


125
0:4:44,48 --> 0:4:45,62
This is how it works.


126
0:4:45,62 --> 0:4:48,54
Ready, you pull like this
and you drop it.


127
0:4:48,54 --> 0:4:50,5
And it goes.


128
0:4:50,5 --> 0:4:51,3
It goes really far.


129
0:4:51,3 --> 0:4:55,25



130
0:4:55,25 --> 0:4:58,89
Usually, right up into
some lady's driveway.


131
0:4:58,89 --> 0:5:2,13
Higginsworth, can you
go get that, please.


132
0:5:2,13 --> 0:5:4,36
Keep that light on me, please.


133
0:5:4,36 --> 0:5:7,8
Thank you.


134
0:5:7,8 --> 0:5:10,52
Well, while this is fun, it's
not the easiest way to do it,


135
0:5:10,52 --> 0:5:12,48
and it's not the least expensive
way to do it, that's


136
0:5:12,48 --> 0:5:14,56
why we had to come up
with a new solution.


137
0:5:14,56 --> 0:5:15,47
It's this.


138
0:5:15,47 --> 0:5:17,44
So we teamed up with our friends
at Science Museum,


139
0:5:17,44 --> 0:5:20,92
Oklahoma, and turned 150
teachers loose, all with


140
0:5:20,92 --> 0:5:23,49
geyser cars, to create an
unforgettable learning


141
0:5:23,49 --> 0:5:24,68
experience.


142
0:5:24,68 --> 0:5:26,6
Take a look at this.
