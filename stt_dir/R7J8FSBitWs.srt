1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:9,69



2
0:0:9,69 --> 0:0:11,3
SHANE SMITH: We'd finally found
our North Koreans deep


3
0:0:11,3 --> 0:0:13,81
in the bush and were busy
talking to them when things


4
0:0:13,81 --> 0:0:15,37
started to get a bit hairy.


5
0:0:15,37 --> 0:0:19,995



6
0:0:19,995 --> 0:0:21,94
Now these guys are
coming back here.


7
0:0:21,94 --> 0:0:23,912
The dude with the crowbar
is coming back.


8
0:0:23,912 --> 0:0:26,71



9
0:0:26,71 --> 0:0:28,474
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING KOREAN]


10
0:0:28,474 --> 0:0:31,68
KIM YUN ZUN: [SPEAKING KOREAN]


11
0:0:31,68 --> 0:0:33,19
IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


12
0:0:33,19 --> 0:0:35,22
SHANE SMITH: He says, what
is that, your off switch?


13
0:0:35,22 --> 0:0:36,47
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


14
0:0:36,47 --> 0:0:39,26



15
0:0:39,26 --> 0:0:42,19
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He says I use
it for fixing tractors.


16
0:0:42,19 --> 0:0:43,48
SHANE SMITH: I like the
Fish more and more.


17
0:0:43,48 --> 0:0:45,6
He took the crowbar from him and
said, what is that, your


18
0:0:45,6 --> 0:0:47,391
off switch?


19
0:0:47,391 --> 0:0:49,37
And two North Koreans
came back.


20
0:0:49,37 --> 0:0:52,15
Now they're giving
Mr. Kim shit.


21
0:0:52,15 --> 0:0:54,19
And they're quite angry.


22
0:0:54,19 --> 0:0:58,5
So we're probably going to
have to get out of here.


23
0:0:58,5 --> 0:0:59,3
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING KOREAN]


24
0:0:59,3 --> 0:1:4,92



25
0:1:4,92 --> 0:1:7,3
SHANE SMITH: And so, oh shit,
here comes another truck.


26
0:1:7,3 --> 0:1:8,19
Now we're surrounded.


27
0:1:8,19 --> 0:1:9,26
They're got a truck up there.


28
0:1:9,26 --> 0:1:12,5
They've got a truck
behind here.


29
0:1:12,5 --> 0:1:12,85
What'd he say?


30
0:1:12,85 --> 0:1:14,505
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He said he
came to tell us that he


31
0:1:14,505 --> 0:1:17,7
doesn't want us filming anymore,
and he's come to


32
0:1:17,7 --> 0:1:18,55
block the road.


33
0:1:18,55 --> 0:1:19,8
SHANE SMITH: Really?


34
0:1:19,8 --> 0:1:27,22



35
0:1:27,22 --> 0:1:28,1
All right.


36
0:1:28,1 --> 0:1:29,8
Well, let's go find
another crew.


37
0:1:29,8 --> 0:1:31,29
Let's go.


38
0:1:31,29 --> 0:1:32,675
The Fish is the boss.


39
0:1:32,675 --> 0:1:35,9



40
0:1:35,9 --> 0:1:38,3
As the Fish took us further
into the forest on these


41
0:1:38,3 --> 0:1:40,57
rutted dirt tracks, the
atmosphere in the truck got a


42
0:1:40,57 --> 0:1:43,43
little bit goofy because of
the lunacy that was being


43
0:1:43,43 --> 0:1:46,58
played out in the oddest game
of low-grade cat and mouse


44
0:1:46,58 --> 0:1:47,49
I've ever seen.


45
0:1:47,49 --> 0:1:50,95
Ask about how we get home.


46
0:1:50,95 --> 0:1:54,4
We're in a high-speed car chase
at five miles an hour


47
0:1:54,4 --> 0:1:57,566
through the wilds of Siberia.


48
0:1:57,566 --> 0:1:59,99
They're stopping, we go to
try to pass them, and


49
0:1:59,99 --> 0:2:0,95
then they speed up.


50
0:2:0,95 --> 0:2:3,32
We sort of go on a side road,
and then they head


51
0:2:3,32 --> 0:2:4,52
us off at the pass.


52
0:2:4,52 --> 0:2:7,87
It's a game of chicken out
in the middle of nowhere.


53
0:2:7,87 --> 0:2:9,12
IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


54
0:2:9,12 --> 0:2:15,742



55
0:2:15,742 --> 0:2:16,734
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He was
just telling us.


56
0:2:16,734 --> 0:2:17,726
KIM YUN ZUN: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


57
0:2:17,726 --> 0:2:18,718
IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


58
0:2:18,718 --> 0:2:20,45
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He says he's
on their blacklist.


59
0:2:20,45 --> 0:2:22,85
SHANE SMITH: The Fish seemed
tired of this game and


60
0:2:22,85 --> 0:2:25,76
suggested we pull over for some
lunch, which consisted of


61
0:2:25,76 --> 0:2:29,24
paprika chips, bread, vodka,
and a shotgun.


62
0:2:29,24 --> 0:2:31,915



63
0:2:31,915 --> 0:2:32,86
IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN], cowboy.


64
0:2:32,86 --> 0:2:33,435
SHANE SMITH: Cowboy.


65
0:2:33,435 --> 0:2:34,685
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Cowboy.


66
0:2:34,685 --> 0:2:42,227



67
0:2:42,227 --> 0:2:44,47
SHANE SMITH: The North Koreans
are going-- what the fuck kind


68
0:2:44,47 --> 0:2:46,53
of journalists are these?


69
0:2:46,53 --> 0:2:47,82
Well, we found our
North Koreans.


70
0:2:47,82 --> 0:2:52,2
Now let's get wasted and shoot
off guns with the mafia.


71
0:2:52,2 --> 0:2:54,86
I hit it, but I didn't
break it.


72
0:2:54,86 --> 0:2:56,66
[APPLAUSE]


73
0:2:56,66 --> 0:2:57,71
SHANE SMITH: It turned
out there was method


74
0:2:57,71 --> 0:2:58,94
in the Fish's madness.


75
0:2:58,94 --> 0:3:1,41
Because our lunchtime shooting
party seemed to have cowed the


76
0:3:1,41 --> 0:3:4,2
North Koreans just enough to get
us out of the wilderness,


77
0:3:4,2 --> 0:3:7,3
which was very good because
the all-menacing Siberian


78
0:3:7,3 --> 0:3:10,57
darkness was fast approaching.


79
0:3:10,57 --> 0:3:13,22
When we finally got to town,
they, of course,


80
0:3:13,22 --> 0:3:14,19
were waiting for us.


81
0:3:14,19 --> 0:3:16,74
And the North Korean security
dude just showed up.


82
0:3:16,74 --> 0:3:18,2
And he won't leave us alone.


83
0:3:18,2 --> 0:3:19,15
And he's just standing
there trying


84
0:3:19,15 --> 0:3:20,71
to look at our passports.


85
0:3:20,71 --> 0:3:23,25
And trying to see all
of our stuff.


86
0:3:23,25 --> 0:3:24,36
He's trying to be scary.


87
0:3:24,36 --> 0:3:25,704
SIMON OSTROVSKY:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


88
0:3:25,704 --> 0:3:28,69
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


89
0:3:28,69 --> 0:3:30,5
SHANE SMITH: And when we got
on the train and said our


90
0:3:30,5 --> 0:3:32,71
teary goodbyes to the Fish, we
realized that half the one-car


91
0:3:32,71 --> 0:3:36,39
train was our crew, and the
other half were North Koreans.


92
0:3:36,39 --> 0:3:37,54
[SPEAKING KOREAN]


93
0:3:37,54 --> 0:3:39,12
SIMON OSTROVSKY: That was
the captain of the camp.


94
0:3:39,12 --> 0:3:39,93
SHANE SMITH: Great.


95
0:3:39,93 --> 0:3:42,74
So we locked ourselves into our
compartment and spent the


96
0:3:42,74 --> 0:3:45,13
night backing up our hard drives
and hiding all of our


97
0:3:45,13 --> 0:3:48,39
footage, which turned out be
wise because we were met back


98
0:3:48,39 --> 0:3:51,83
in Tynda by the FSB, the local
militia, the North Koreans,


99
0:3:51,83 --> 0:3:54,3
and some plainclothes detectives
who promptly


100
0:3:54,3 --> 0:3:54,98
detained us.


101
0:3:54,98 --> 0:3:56,51
So they asked us a
lot of questions.


102
0:3:56,51 --> 0:3:58,91
And they kept asking us
about the pipeline.


103
0:3:58,91 --> 0:4:0,185
Are you here to shoot
the pipeline?


104
0:4:0,185 --> 0:4:1,34
Are you here to shoot
the pipeline?


105
0:4:1,34 --> 0:4:2,5
We were like, we don't know
anything about a pipeline.


106
0:4:2,5 --> 0:4:4,44
We're here to shoot
North Koreans.


107
0:4:4,44 --> 0:4:7,1
They knew about the Russian cop
who had taken us to the


108
0:4:7,1 --> 0:4:7,7
North Korean camp.


109
0:4:7,7 --> 0:4:9,62
They knew about the chief
of police in the north.


110
0:4:9,62 --> 0:4:13,55
Simon refused to be intimidated,
and he said, if


111
0:4:13,55 --> 0:4:15,43
you want to ask any questions,
ask me here.


112
0:4:15,43 --> 0:4:16,339
I'm not going with you.


113
0:4:16,339 --> 0:4:17,69
I'm not going away with you.


114
0:4:17,69 --> 0:4:18,85
They finally let us go.


115
0:4:18,85 --> 0:4:20,6
We freaked out a little
bit, grabbed our


116
0:4:20,6 --> 0:4:22,89
stuff, and took off.


117
0:4:22,89 --> 0:4:24,32
We quickly hired a car
and made a break


118
0:4:24,32 --> 0:4:25,48
for the Chinese border.


119
0:4:25,48 --> 0:4:28,11
When we finally got to the
border, we realized that part


120
0:4:28,11 --> 0:4:30,8
of the reason for all this panic
and fear on the North


121
0:4:30,8 --> 0:4:33,26
Korean and Russian side was that
Kim Jong-Il, who almost


122
0:4:33,26 --> 0:4:35,91
never leaves North Korea, had
secretly come to the same


123
0:4:35,91 --> 0:4:39,4
place we were, the Amur region
of Russia, coincidentally at


124
0:4:39,4 --> 0:4:42,2
the exact same time we were
there to hold talks with


125
0:4:42,2 --> 0:4:45,21
President Medvedev about more
trade and labor agreements


126
0:4:45,21 --> 0:4:47,66
between the two countries.


127
0:4:47,66 --> 0:4:50,77
So this means that, while we
were there, the Great Leader


128
0:4:50,77 --> 0:4:53,78
was selling even more of his
people off, so he could make


129
0:4:53,78 --> 0:4:57,68
even more money, so you could
make more weapons, so he could


130
0:4:57,68 --> 0:5:1,11
extort more food and aid and
supplies from America and


131
0:5:1,11 --> 0:5:4,2
Japan, who he's technically
still at war with.


132
0:5:4,2 --> 0:5:10,34



133
0:5:10,34 --> 0:5:14,13
And this, better than almost
anything I could think of,


134
0:5:14,13 --> 0:5:17,8
sums up the lunacy of
the modern world.


135
0:5:17,8 --> 0:5:18,52
Thank you and goodnight.


136
0:5:18,52 --> 0:5:32,54

0:5:32,54 --> 0:5:33,79
