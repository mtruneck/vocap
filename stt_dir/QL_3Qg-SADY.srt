SHANE SMITH: Nearly every
industry in the world has a


6
0:0:16,2 --> 0:0:17,0
trade show.


7
0:0:17,0 --> 0:0:20,7
You have car shows, electronics
shows, even comics


8
0:0:20,7 --> 0:0:21,61
have their own trade shows.


9
0:0:21,61 --> 0:0:24,63
But here in Jordan for the last
14 years, in huge tents


10
0:0:24,63 --> 0:0:26,46
in the middle of the desert,
they have a massive


11
0:0:26,46 --> 0:0:29,14
trade show for war.


12
0:0:29,14 --> 0:0:31,45
It's called the Special
Operations Forces Exhibition,


13
0:0:31,45 --> 0:0:34,333
or SOFEX for short, and it's
hosted by Jordan's King


14
0:0:34,333 --> 0:0:37,95
Abdullah II, one of America's
only allies


15
0:0:37,95 --> 0:0:39,4
in the Middle East.


16
0:0:39,4 --> 0:0:42,15
I wanted to know exactly what
was for sale and just who was


17
0:0:42,15 --> 0:0:44,34
selling it at the world's
largest special-forces


18
0:0:44,34 --> 0:0:46,21
supermarket.


19
0:0:46,21 --> 0:0:49,5
But I'm a magazine guy, not a
gun guy, so I brought along an


20
0:0:49,5 --> 0:0:52,16
ex-Marine and an Iraq War vet,
Matt Ruskin, to help me sort


21
0:0:52,16 --> 0:0:54,86
through all this stuff.


22
0:0:54,86 --> 0:0:56,66
SHANE SMITH: It gets
interesting, because when you


23
0:0:56,66 --> 0:1:0,21
walk through security and you
come to this, it's sort of


24
0:1:0,21 --> 0:1:2,595
like a trade show out in the
middle of the desert.


25
0:1:2,595 --> 0:1:5,14
And the first thing you see are
like any other trade show,


26
0:1:5,14 --> 0:1:5,84

27
0:1:5,84 --> 0:1:9,58

Javelin missile.

between $350 billion to $500
billion a year, one of the


42

in the world.

0:3:14,73 --> 0:3:16,725
So here come some of the
special ops forces.


71
0:3:16,725 --> 0:3:22,51



72
0:3:22,51 --> 0:3:25,55
Jordan has a profound, almost
pathological, fixation with


73
0:3:25,55 --> 0:3:26,61
special ops.


74
0:3:26,61 --> 0:3:27,34
Why?


75
0:3:27,34 --> 0:3:30,38
Well, one, because it borders
with Syria, Israel, Saudi


76
0:3:30,38 --> 0:3:31,72
Arabia, and Iraq.


77
0:3:31,72 --> 0:3:35,29
And two, because "special ops"
is code for taking down


78
0:3:35,29 --> 0:3:38,3
terrorists, insurgents, or
anyone else that the


79
0:3:38,3 --> 0:3:42,4
government deems to
be undesirable.


80
0:3:42,4 --> 0:3:45,18
And since 9/11, if you join
the fight against global


81
0:3:45,18 --> 0:3:48,63
terrorism, it also means that
Uncle Sam will cut you a nice


82
0:3:48,63 --> 0:3:51,35
big check for weapons,
especially if they're


83
0:3:51,35 --> 0:3:52,6

84
0:3:52,6 --> 0:4:2,125

show of force.


86
0:4:4,45 --> 0:4:6,236
They took over the building.


87
0:4:6,236 --> 0:4:7,17
They dropped the people in.


88
0:4:7,17 --> 0:4:8,85
There was a hostage crisis.


89
0:4:8,85 --> 0:4:11,18
They did it all, they
killed everybody.


90
0:4:11,18 --> 0:4:13,4
And now SOFEX is
going to begin.


91
0:4:13,4 --> 0:4:16,19
And if you didn't know that
the military industrial


92

you'd be wrong.

for each operator.

And the more you can expose
them to in a controlled


145
0:6:30,26 --> 0:6:32,9

better operator he's going to

told that in the building,


208
0:9:11,69 --> 0:9:16,89
they've initiated some kind of
an odor, as well as probably


209
0:9:16,89 --> 0:9:17,95
some smoke and so on.


210
0:9:17,95 --> 0:9:18,55
[HISSING SOUND]


211
0:9:18,55 --> 0:9:19,45
I smell something.


212
0:9:19,45 --> 0:9:22,112
I don't know what it is.


213
0:9:22,112 --> 0:9:24,41
[EXPLOSION]


214
0:9:24,41 --> 0:9:27,6
This is like the worst thing I
could possibly think of right


215
0:9:27,6 --> 0:9:30,47
now, being hung over, and
they're going to make it smell


216
0:9:30,47 --> 0:9:32,2
like rotting flesh.


217
0:9:32,2 --> 0:9:35,44
MALE SPEAKER 5: Burnt hair,
oily machinery, dead body.


218
0:9:35,44 --> 0:9:36,85

219
0:9:36,85 --> 0:9:42,73



220
0:9:42,73 --> 0:9:45,63
SHANE SMITH: Is there ever a
worry that baddies would come


221
0:9:45,63 --> 0:9:47,25
and use the area as training?


222
0:9:47,25 --> 0:9:51,64
Because you know, you have
Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria,


223
0:9:51,64 --> 0:9:54,832
all those neighbors, and
you just wonder who


224
0:9:54,832 --> 0:9:56,38
gets to come train.


225
0:9:56,38 --> 0:9:57,59
CHARLES REDLINGER: Well,
Jordan's in a tough


226
0:9:57,59 --> 0:9:57,71
neighborhood.


227
0:9:57,71 --> 0:10:0,33
There's no doubt about it.


228
0:10:0,33 --> 0:10:2,46
SHANE SMITH: Jordan is in
a tough neighborhood.


229
0:10:2,46 --> 0:10:5,21
In fact, both Egypt and Syria
are currently trying to put


230
0:10:5,21 --> 0:10:8,8
down popular rebellions, and
Iraq is basically in a full-on


231
0:10:8,8 --> 0:10:11,43
special-ops civil war.


232
0:10:11,43 --> 0:10:14,42
And where are they getting
all these weapons?


233
0:10:14,42 --> 0:10:16,7
SOFEX.


234
0:10:16,7 --> 0:10:20,11
How hard is it to come and buy
arms on the open market?


235
0:10:20,11 --> 0:10:37,9



236
0:10:37,9 --> 0:10:38,94
SHANE SMITH: And we noticed
that they sell kits.


237
0:10:38,94 --> 0:10:42,51
For example, you can buy a
regular helicopter, but you


238
0:10:42,51 --> 0:10:46,71
can buy a kit to upgrade it to
add in a missile system or


239
0:10:46,71 --> 0:10:48,19
Gatling gun system
quite easily.


240
0:10:48,19 --> 0:10:49,44
RAPHAEL DE SUPERCAZE:
Yes, of course.


241
0:10:49,44 --> 0:11:4,7



242
0:11:4,7 --> 0:11:8,9
SHANE SMITH: So I can buy a
helicopter from one country,


243
0:11:8,9 --> 0:11:10,97
and I can buy a weapons system
from another country, and then


244
0:11:10,97 --> 0:11:12,3
have an attack helicopter?


245
0:11:12,3 --> 0:11:13,55
RAPHAEL DE SUPERCAZE: Yes.


246
0:11:13,55 --> 0:11:18,37



247
0:11:18,37 --> 0:11:19,79
SHANE SMITH: So North Korea's
bought some of these?


248
0:11:19,79 --> 0:11:21,8
RAPHAEL DE SUPERCAZE: Yes.


249
0:11:21,8 --> 0:11:28,43



250
0:11:28,43 --> 0:11:29,38
SHANE SMITH: Can I
have a key chain?


251
0:11:29,38 --> 0:11:30,12
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah, sure.


252
0:11:30,12 --> 0:11:30,986
SHANE SMITH: Thank you.


253
0:11:30,986 --> 0:11:33,28
Where are you guys from?


254
0:11:33,28 --> 0:11:35,77
SHANE SMITH: Kazakhstan.


255
0:11:35,77 --> 0:11:38,4
Czech Republic.


256
0:11:38,4 --> 0:11:39,22
Is that made in Azerbaijan?

0:11:39,22 --> 0:11:39,96
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Yes.


258
0:11:39,96 --> 0:11:40,8
SHANE SMITH: Yeah?


259
0:11:40,8 --> 0:11:43,48
So Azerbaijan makes the
biggest, longest

SHANE SMITH: Germany.


264
0:11:48,6 --> 0:11:49,29
Turkey is here.


265
0:11:49,29 --> 0:11:50,53
China is here.


266
0:11:50,53 --> 0:11:51,76
Jordan is here.


267
0:11:51,76 --> 0:11:54,4
The Russians are here, all
selling weapons systems to


268
0:11:54,4 --> 0:11:58,47
whoever wants to buy them.


269
0:11:58,47 --> 0:11:59,33
You want jets?


270
0:11:59,33 --> 0:12:2,21
You want rockets, helicopter
grenade,


271
0:12:2,21 --> 0:12:3,71
RoboCop killer systems?


272
0:12:3,71 --> 0:12:3,823
[ROBOT VOICE]


273
0:12:3,823 --> 0:12:5,888
You have 20 seconds to comply.


274
0:12:5,888 --> 0:12:8,21
You got it.


275
0:12:8,21 --> 0:12:9,92
That's an automatic
grenade launcher.


276
0:12:9,92 --> 0:12:11,15
MATT RUSKIN: That's my favorite
weapon in the entire


277
0:12:11,15 --> 0:12:13,31
Marine Corps arsenal there.


278
0:12:13,31 --> 0:12:13,966
SHANE SMITH: No one's
stopping him.


279
0:12:13,966 --> 0:12:15,61
No one's saying, hey, you
shouldn't be actually playing


280
0:12:15,61 --> 0:12:18,66
with the grenade launcher.


281
0:12:18,66 --> 0:12:21,7
Now fucking around with these
dudes and their guns was fun.


282
0:12:21,7 --> 0:12:23,68
But after a while you start to
freak out, because you realize


283
0:12:23,68 --> 0:12:26,6
that they're selling weapons the
same way that you'd sell


284
0:12:26,6 --> 0:12:27,47
next year's car model.


285
0:12:27,47 --> 0:12:28,69
MALE SPEAKER 7: The world's
most demanding


286
0:12:28,69 --> 0:12:31,51
shooters demand SIG.


287
0:12:31,51 --> 0:12:33,75
This is the world's most
revolutionary pistol.


288
0:12:33,75 --> 0:12:36,84
We have the resources and
the energy to solve


289
0:12:36,84 --> 0:12:38,93
any small-arms problem.


290
0:12:38,93 --> 0:12:42,1
SHANE SMITH: Javelin would be
one of the most innovative


291
0:12:42,1 --> 0:12:43,35
weapons systems.


292
0:12:43,35 --> 0:12:51,72



293
0:12:51,72 --> 0:12:53,73
SHANE SMITH: And when he says
successful, what he really


294
0:12:53,73 --> 0:12:57,9
means is that it's great
at destroying stuff.


295
0:12:57,9 --> 0:13:0,9
And we weren't the only ones to
notice, like the Marine we


296
0:13:0,9 --> 0:13:3,705
ran into who had just finished
his second tour in Iraq.


297
0:13:3,705 --> 0:13:22,15



298
0:13:22,15 --> 0:13:23,93
SHANE SMITH: And the biggest
sellers by far are the


299
0:13:23,93 --> 0:13:25,11
American companies.


300
0:13:25,11 --> 0:13:29,1
In fact, 16 of the 20 largest
arms manufacturers are based


301
0:13:29,1 --> 0:13:30,63
in the United States.


302
0:13:30,63 --> 0:13:33,3
And being the biggest store in
the mall means selling a lot


303
0:13:33,3 --> 0:13:35,68
of weapons to a lot of people.


304
0:13:35,68 --> 0:13:38,42
What's crazy about this is that
America gives a lot of


305
0:13:38,42 --> 0:13:41,66
these countries foreign aid so
that they can come here and


306
0:13:41,66 --> 0:13:44,75
buy weapons systems from
their companies.


307
0:13:44,75 --> 0:13:47,48
It's kind of like a parent
giving their kids the credit


308
0:13:47,48 --> 0:13:50,44
card and saying, go to the mall
that I own and just buy


309
0:13:50,44 --> 0:13:51,99
whatever you want.


310
0:13:51,99 --> 0:13:55,36
So the last time you were in the
Middle East, you were in


311
0:13:55,36 --> 0:13:57,21
Iraq as a Marine.


312
0:13:57,21 --> 0:14:1,14
Does it spin you out to see like
Northrop Grumman, General


313
0:14:1,14 --> 0:14:5,12
Dynamics, all these American
companies making tons of money


314
0:14:5,12 --> 0:14:7,9
off of war?


315
0:14:7,9 --> 0:14:9,89
MATT RUSKIN: What's the trip is
you see Norinco right here


316
0:14:9,89 --> 0:14:12,16
next to an American
arms display.


317
0:14:12,16 --> 0:14:15,4
And they used to launch 9-foot
Norinco rockets on us.


318
0:14:15,4 --> 0:14:15,59
SHANE SMITH: Really?


319
0:14:15,59 --> 0:14:16,89
MATT RUSKIN: Yeah.


320
0:14:16,89 --> 0:14:20,31
SHANE SMITH: The insurgents
would buy Norinco rockets and


321
0:14:20,31 --> 0:14:21,28
then use them against you.


322
0:14:21,28 --> 0:14:25,93
And they're right next to the
American military companies.


323
0:14:25,93 --> 0:14:27,21
Interesting.


324
0:14:27,21 --> 0:14:29,29
So we went over to the Norinco
booth to see if they could


325
0:14:29,29 --> 0:14:32,39
explain how their weapons ended
up in the hands of Iraqi


326
0:14:32,39 --> 0:14:33,513

While we couldn't get an answer
from the Chinese,


355
0:15:5,34 --> 0:15:7,97
sitting right there on display
in the next booth over were


356
0:15:7,97 --> 0:15:11,19
shells that were exactly the
same as the ones Iraqi


357
0:15:11,19 --> 0:15:14,6
insurgents used to make roadside
bombs, or IEDs.


358
0:15:14,6 --> 0:15:17,28
MATT RUSKIN: All right, they
take the tips off of these,


359
0:15:17,28 --> 0:15:19,75
and you can see it's pretty
hollow in there.


360
0:15:19,75 --> 0:15:22,33
And they'll pack this whole
thing full of C4, and it


361
0:15:22,33 --> 0:15:24,54
creates some hellacious
shrapnel.

just buy it like you would a

I guess it does give
you a little bit of

see, it's designed to hit

on as many of the skill sets
that these guys possess, and


390
0:16:26,45 --> 0:16:28,99

those, stamina,

No.

countries that some of these
guys come from, you can't help


405
0:16:49,65 --> 0:16:52,59
but wonder the circumstances in
which these urban assault

0:16:52,59 --> 0:16:55,74
skills are going to
be put to use.


407
0:16:55,74 --> 0:16:57,94
And if the recent uprisings
in the Arab world are any


408
0:16:57,94 --> 0:17:1,824
indication, the answer
is simple, at home.

you guys doing?

Now how you boys doing?

win, then I'll put my

0:17:11,19 --> 0:17:12,77
I'm happy.

0:17:12,77 --> 0:17:15,5
And what do you think about
competitions like this?


421
0:17:15,5 --> 0:17:16,74
MALE SPEAKER 14: Friendly
competition's always a great


422
0:17:16,74 --> 0:17:18,63
thing, because it lets you know
what you need to work on.


423
0:17:18,63 --> 0:17:20,19
And you should get up, get
to meet new people.


424
0:17:20,19 --> 0:17:22,43
Because connections around the
world right now is a big deal.


425
0:17:22,43 --> 0:17:24,349
So getting to know guys you
might see down the road in

427
0:17:26,79 --> 0:17:27,45
definitely goes a long way.

[GUNSHOTS]


429
0:17:29,97 --> 0:17:32,55
SHANE SMITH: And recognizing
faces is important.


430
0:17:32,55 --> 0:17:35,45
In fact, facial recognition
technology is just the latest


431
0:17:35,45 --> 0:17:38,55
feature being built into many
unarmed aerial vehicles, which


432
0:17:38,55 --> 0:17:40,472
are also known as drones.


433
0:17:40,472 --> 0:17:43,16
You know, when you were a kid,
you used to have those little


434
0:17:43,16 --> 0:17:44,19
model airplanes.


435
0:17:44,19 --> 0:17:46,74
And there'd be like, somebody's
dad would be a real


436
0:17:46,74 --> 0:17:48,27
nerd and have the
model airplane.


437
0:17:48,27 --> 0:17:52,27
Now, it's all
model-airplane-style drones


438
0:17:52,27 --> 0:17:54,14
that can take pictures
or drop bombs.


439
0:17:54,14 --> 0:17:57,94



440
0:17:57,94 --> 0:18:0,14
The sad thing is that countries
who actually buy


441
0:18:0,14 --> 0:18:4,1
this stuff rarely end up using
it against foreign militaries.


442
0:18:4,1 --> 0:18:5,76
More often than not,
they're turning it


443
0:18:5,76 --> 0:18:7,22
against their own citizens.


444
0:18:7,22 --> 0:18:9,45
And thanks to the number of
governments who are afraid of


445
0:18:9,45 --> 0:18:14,11
their own people, business
is booming.


446
0:18:14,11 --> 0:18:16,4
ADAM THOMAS: We've just made
an assessment of the global


447
0:18:16,4 --> 0:18:17,855
security market spending.


448
0:18:17,855 --> 0:18:20,335
And our assessment this year
is we think spending on


449
0:18:20,335 --> 0:18:23,0
security's between
$180-190 billion.


450
0:18:23,0 --> 0:18:25,605
We now see that doubling
to $400 billion in


451
0:18:25,605 --> 0:18:26,93
the next four years.


452
0:18:26,93 --> 0:18:28,96
SHANE SMITH: $400 billion
just on--


453
0:18:28,96 --> 0:18:30,1
ADAM THOMAS: That's everything,
from border


454
0:18:30,1 --> 0:18:33,94
security, homeland security,
anti-immigration, anti-drug,


455
0:18:33,94 --> 0:18:35,77
protection of oil fields,
and everything else.


456
0:18:35,77 --> 0:18:37,15
SHANE SMITH: So even
in a recession--


457
0:18:37,15 --> 0:18:37,98
ADAM THOMAS: Yep.


458
0:18:37,98 --> 0:18:41,57
So you can see two to three
times more on security


459
0:18:41,57 --> 0:18:42,77
spending than there's
going to be on


460
0:18:42,77 --> 0:18:44,27
defense tactical spending.


461
0:18:44,27 --> 0:18:45,545
Hence, the importance
of SOFEX.

0:18:45,545 --> 0:18:50,35



463
0:18:50,35 --> 0:18:52,9
SHANE SMITH: So we
just left SOFEX.


464
0:18:52,9 --> 0:18:54,21
We're pretty spun out.


465
0:18:54,21 --> 0:18:57,67
A lot of generals, a lot of
weapons systems, missiles,


466
0:18:57,67 --> 0:19:2,3
tanks, planes, helicopters,
and it's kind of a bummer.


467
0:19:2,3 --> 0:19:4,69
And as we left SOFEX, the
magnitude of what we


468
0:19:4,69 --> 0:19:6,4
just saw hit us.


469
0:19:6,4 --> 0:19:9,6
If the arms markets are doubling
every year in sales,


470
0:19:9,6 --> 0:19:12,33
it means that the armies are
actually using and expending


471
0:19:12,33 --> 0:19:15,876
their weapons, which means,
quite simply, that they're


472
0:19:15,876 --> 0:19:16,324
killing people.
