###1 NATISHA LANCE, CNN ANCHOR: So you may have heard that the day after Thanksgiving is sometimes
###4 called Black Friday. But do you know why? Well, you are about to find out. I`m Natisha
###8 Lance in for Carl, and this is CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###25 War planes and rockets crossing paths in the sky. Right now that`s part of daily life for
###31 people living in parts of Israel and Gaza. The signs of the fight maybe in the air, but
###35 the impact is on the ground. This is an office building in Gaza that`s been used by some
###40 media organizations. It was hit by an Israeli air strike on Monday. Israel said Palestinian
###45 militants were hiding in there. Israel`s targets include government buildings, police stations
###50 and the homes of Hamas officials. That`s the terrorist group that took control of the government
###55 of Gaza in 2007. Israel has launched strikes against more than 1300 sites since the fighting
###61 started.
###62 The rockets are flying in both directions. In Gaza, militants from Hamas are launching
###66 them into Israel. More than 1000 rockets have been fired from Gaza since the start of the
###71 conflict. On Monday, one of those hit a school in southern Israel. It`s been closed since
###76 the fighting began.
###77 Now, CNN reporters are in Gaza and Israel covering this conflict, and at times doing
###82 their job can put them near the fighting. Now, you are about to see how they react in
###86 those situations. First, Anderson Cooper in Gaza, then Frederick Pleitgen in Israel.
###89 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###90 ANDERSON COOPER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: One family, also two media centers built ....
###95 (explosion)
###96 Wow.
###97 Well, that was a rather large explosion. That occurred -- if you just look out here - I
###104 can`t actually see where the impact (no sound) that was, it`s actually set off a number of
###109 fire alarms. But that was probably the largest explosion that we`ve heard just in the past
###114 -- really, in the past hour. There have been a number of explosions in the last hour or
###119 two. But that one - that one was pretty loud.
###122 FREDERIK PLELTGEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: OK, we have an alarm going off right now. I`m
###126 going to have to seek cover. We are going to go over here. Let`s take the camera off
###129 the tripod, though.
###130 All right. Seems like something impacted in the distance, not sure how far away. OK, the
###142 alarm stopped.
###142 So, it seems the impact was quite away in the distance, I would say, a couple of miles,
###146 probably, in the distance. There, over in the sky, you probably won`t be able to see
###149 it here, there is an interceptor missile taking off right now, that is the Iron Dome interceptor,
###154 right? If you just saw the flash in the sky, that was a rocket coming out of Gaza that
###158 was just intercepted right now.
###159 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###160 LANCE: Now, you heard Fred Pleitgen mention the Iron Dome. It`s Israeli Defense System
###164 that shoots down rockets coming in from Gaza, so far it`s intercepted about 30 percent of
###169 those rockets. Frederik has more on this technology and how it works.
###173 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###174 PLELTGEN: This video shows an Iron Dome missile intercepting a rocket fired from Gaza at Tel
###178 Aviv on Sunday.
###183 The defense system had just been installed in Israel`s largest city a few hours earlier.
###189 Several days into the conflict, it`s already clear: the Iron Dome is having a big impact
###194 picking off hundreds of rockets.
###196 I got a tour of the Israel aircraft industry`s plant that assembles the air defense system.
###200 DR. ISRAEL OZNOWICH: Deployment is the matter of minutes.
###203 PLELTGEN: Dr. Israel Oznowich is one of those in charge. One key element is an advanced
###209 radar.
###209 OZNOWICH: The radar such as locates, tracks and intercepts and guides the intercepting
###216 missiles within several seconds, few seconds within the launching time.
###221 PLELTGEN: It`s extremely hard to shoot down short distance rockets like the ones coming
###225 out of Gaza, in part because they are not in the air for older radar systems to lock
###230 onto them.

###232 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###233 AUNG SAN SUU KYI, DEMOCRACY ADVOCATE: I would like to say how happy I am to receive President
###237 Obama in my country and in my house. The friendship between our two countries is of long standing.
###243 The United States has been staunch in its support of the democracy movement in Burma,
###248 and we are confident that this support will continue through the difficult years that
###253 lie ahead.
###254 I say difficult, because the most difficult time in any transition is when we think that
###260 success is in site.
###261 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###265 LANCE: There was some history happening right there, in that video. President Obama was
###269 visiting the home of Aung San Suu Kyi, that home is in Myanmar and Barack Obama is the
###274 first American president to go there. It was the middle stop on his trip to Asia. He went
###279 there after visiting in Thailand and before going to a conference in Cambodia. Myanmar,
###284 which used to be knows as Burma, was the big focus of this trip. For decades, it was closed
###289 off from the rest of the world, denied political freedoms and people who pushed for democracy
###293 like Suu Kyi were punished. The country has started making some reforms and during the
###298 president`s visit he said, also some changes could lead to incredible opportunities for
###303 Myanmar and its people.
###305 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###306 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s time for the "Shoutout." In the economic world, what color is associated
###312 with profits? If you think you know it, then shout it out. Is it green? Blue? Red? Or Black?
###319 You`ve got three seconds, go!
###324 When a company is making a profit, it`s said to be in the black. That`s your answer and
###333 that`s your "Shoutout."
###335 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###337 LANCE: That`s why this Friday is called Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving officially
###342 takes off the holiday shopping season. It`s one of the busiest shopping days of the entire
###346 year, and it`s when stores make enough sales to hopefully put themselves in the black.
###351 Some stores aren`t waiting for Black Friday to start Black Friday. Wal-Mart, Sears, Target
###356 and Toys R Us are some of the stores that are open on Thanksgiving evening. That might
###360 sound good to shoppers, but not to some of the employees who work there. They`ve started
###365 petitions against the early openings, so that workers can spend Thanksgiving with their
###369 own families. Some Wal-Mart employees are planning to protest by walking off the job
###373 on Black Friday.
###375 And before they sit down for Thanksgiving, or head out shopping on Black Friday, a lot
###380 of people have to get where they are going for the holiday. According to AAA, more than
###384 43 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles for Thanksgiving. Most of
###389 those will be going by car, but more than 3 million will be traveling by plane. So,
###393 if you are heading to the airport, don`t expect to see too many empty seats on your flights.
###398 So, let`s talk about college for a minute. There is still some time before applications
###403 are due at most schools, but how do you pick which college to apply to?
###406 There is a lot to consider, there is location, what programs are offered, how much it costs,
###411 and how are you going to pay for it.
###412 Those last two are what Christine Romans looks at in this report.
###416 (BEIGN VIDEOTAPE)
###416 CHRISTIANE ROMANS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: At this college fare high school junior Veronica Woodley
###420 is exploring her options.
###422 VERONICA WOODLEY, HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR: Finding schools that had premed and I can major in
###428 biology to become a dermatologist. And to also minor in Spanish.
###430 ROMANS: Picking the right college is a high stakes decision with a high price tag. Average
###434 tuition for a year at a public college is more than $22000 for in-state students. A
###440 private college, more than $43,000. Community colleges cost $15,000 a year. Not all kids
###447 borrow for college, but those who do, graduate with $27,000 in debt on average. With a price
###453 tag like that college choice is a careful investment that depends on the student`s talents
###458 and finances.
###459 Most important, you have to graduate from school in four years, no more five years,
###464 and you have to pick the right school. If you haven`t saved any money, you can`t pick
###468 the super expensive school and graduate five years later.
###472 For students like Veronica and her mom Kathy, it`s an exciting time. And a lesson in high
###477 finance. They are crunching the numbers and considering all the options.
###481 WOODLEY: I mean on scholarships, financial aid, and then - I work, but my mom - -I think
###487 like my mom will do most of they paying, but I mean I will help her out, of course.
###494 Christine Romans, CNN, New York.
###496 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###497 LANCE: Thanksgiving is only two days away, and we ask you to tell us what you are thankful
###500 for. And you definitely didn`t hesitate with sharing with us.
###504 Betsaida said she is thankful for the holidays, family and friends, as well as Thanksgiving
###509 day, because it reminds us of what we are most thankful for.
###512 Ms. Risley`s reading class told us they are thankful for good health, a safe home and
###517 family members, plus they are grateful to the soldiers who keep us safe and for living
###520 in the USA.
###522 Victoria is thankful for this country as well, and how it`s prospering even during the tough
###527 time. Sarah is thankful her great grandmother is still alive and will be turning 90 year
###532 old. Happy birthday, Grandma.
###534 Ronnie is being raised to be a young man, thanks to his mom, and he`s also thankful
###539 for his great education and good grades.
###541 While we all could probably agree with Peri on this one, who is thankful for everything
###545 that makes us smile. And so many of you wrote that you are thankful for your family, your
###549 friends and even for CNN STUDENT NEWS. But we are definitely grateful for all of you,
###554 too. And we are also thankful for the people who sent an I-report on this topic, so if
###558 you go to the spotlight section on our home page, you`ll find a link to watch those. But
###562 before we go, we are going to check out this cardboard village. They young people who you
###567 see putting it together, right there, they are planning to camp out there overnight.
###572 This was in Colorado, and yes, it`s going to be cold, but that was the point: they were
###576 trying to raise awareness about homelessness by facing some of the challenges that the
###580 homeless regularly deal with. It`s a good cause and a good story to wrap up our week.
###585 CNN STUDENT NEWS returns on Monday, and we hope you all have a very happy Thanksgiving.
###589 Until then, I`m Natisha Lance.
