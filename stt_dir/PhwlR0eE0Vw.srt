1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:10,12



2
0:0:10,12 --> 0:0:12,36
BRYAN IGUCHI: I guess I could
say an average person could


3
0:0:12,36 --> 0:0:13,8
definitely become a
good snowboarder.


4
0:0:13,8 --> 0:0:18,27
You know good enough to have a
great time in the mountains.


5
0:0:18,27 --> 0:0:20,72
It's worth it, it's fun.


6
0:0:20,72 --> 0:0:24,98
SPEAKER: It could take up to
a month to become a pro.


7
0:0:24,98 --> 0:0:26,65
BRYAN IGUCHI: Oh at least.


8
0:0:26,65 --> 0:0:29,44
BRYAN FOX: He's legendary
everywhere, but down there he


9
0:0:29,44 --> 0:0:32,895
was you know, that type of thing
where like the Guch is


10
0:0:32,895 --> 0:0:34,63
like from here.


11
0:0:34,63 --> 0:0:37,3
There's not a lot of people
who are from Southern


12
0:0:37,3 --> 0:0:43,1
California and really made any
sort of impact on snowboarding


13
0:0:43,1 --> 0:0:44,76
in general.


14
0:0:44,76 --> 0:0:48,86
I'd say Guch is like the most
influential Southern


15
0:0:48,86 --> 0:0:52,53
California snowboarder.


16
0:0:52,53 --> 0:0:55,9
That'd be my personal opinion.


17
0:0:55,9 --> 0:0:58,31
PAT BRIDGES: Guch was a
sponsored skateboarder, I


18
0:0:58,31 --> 0:1:1,48
think he skated for
EPIC skateboards,


19
0:1:1,48 --> 0:1:2,39
something like that.


20
0:1:2,39 --> 0:1:5,92
So even before he got into
snowboarding you knew he was a


21
0:1:5,92 --> 0:1:6,75
skater which was cool.


22
0:1:6,75 --> 0:1:10,8
BRYAN IGUCHI: I was 13 years
old and I got sponsored by


23
0:1:10,8 --> 0:1:12,575
EPIC Skateboards out of
northern California.


24
0:1:12,575 --> 0:1:17,28
But I actually got my first
skate shot in "TransWorld,"


25
0:1:17,28 --> 0:1:19,8
Spike Jones shot it.


26
0:1:19,8 --> 0:1:24,69
And I was doing a feeble grind
on like a flat bar in '89, I


27
0:1:24,69 --> 0:1:26,29
think it was.


28
0:1:26,29 --> 0:1:28,99
So the skateboarding
thing was always--


29
0:1:28,99 --> 0:1:32,96



30
0:1:32,96 --> 0:1:35,42
I was trying to go pro doing
it but then I started


31
0:1:35,42 --> 0:1:36,96
snowboarding at the same time.


32
0:1:36,96 --> 0:1:39,91
And just kind of shifted from
skateboarding to snowboarding.


33
0:1:39,91 --> 0:1:42,59
KEVIN JONES: When I started
snowboarding, I really thought


34
0:1:42,59 --> 0:1:43,58
it was gay.


35
0:1:43,58 --> 0:1:47,24
I mean, in gay in the true
sense of the word.


36
0:1:47,24 --> 0:1:49,63
I was like wow there is other
people out there like me, they


37
0:1:49,63 --> 0:1:52,51
skateboard and they snowboard,
wow this is cool, maybe it's


38
0:1:52,51 --> 0:1:54,29
not as gay as I thought
it was.


39
0:1:54,29 --> 0:1:57,94
And then you saw like these
trend setters, you saw all


40
0:1:57,94 --> 0:2:0,47
these guys that are--


41
0:2:0,47 --> 0:2:3,54
Guch especially, just this
little short guy with these


42
0:2:3,54 --> 0:2:7,82
huge jeans, and then the irony
was after a day of shredding


43
0:2:7,82 --> 0:2:10,4
they would get wet, and when
the sun would go down, and


44
0:2:10,4 --> 0:2:11,98
you'd be riding in them , and
they would turn into these big


45
0:2:11,98 --> 0:2:16,37
bells, these frozen bells, and
your leg would just be like in


46
0:2:16,37 --> 0:2:17,99
this thing.


47
0:2:17,99 --> 0:2:18,99
It was like--


48
0:2:18,99 --> 0:2:25,1
it was the worse like coldest
trend in snowboarding to date.


49
0:2:25,1 --> 0:2:26,59
But that era was just funny.


50
0:2:26,59 --> 0:2:27,47
But it was like--


51
0:2:27,47 --> 0:2:30,88
it was the whole attitude
of the snowboarders and


52
0:2:30,88 --> 0:2:33,35
skateboarders back then,
it was like rebellious.


53
0:2:33,35 --> 0:2:35,67
And everybody made fun of you
because you wore big jeans,


54
0:2:35,67 --> 0:2:37,35
but you were like yeah
that's right.


55
0:2:37,35 --> 0:2:40,3
You don't understand man, you
don't understand what I'm


56
0:2:40,3 --> 0:2:42,67
doing with these jeans.


57
0:2:42,67 --> 0:2:44,57
TERJE HAAKONSEN: I met
Guch, just kind of


58
0:2:44,57 --> 0:2:47,14
signed up with Burton.


59
0:2:47,14 --> 0:2:51,14
He was riding in big baggy
jeans, he had a small bong in


60
0:2:51,14 --> 0:2:56,66
his pocket, he had super long
hair, he was from SoCal, he


61
0:2:56,66 --> 0:3:0,51
loves his chips and
salsa, and he


62
0:3:0,51 --> 0:3:2,99
introduced me to a few things.


63
0:3:2,99 --> 0:3:5,8
KEVIN JONES: Guch kind of has
this lure to him, this like


64
0:3:5,8 --> 0:3:12,45
ninja, Japanese, like mystical
Guch, and there's this shot of


65
0:3:12,45 --> 0:3:15,66
him with like-- it's all
back-lit and there's just a


66
0:3:15,66 --> 0:3:17,73
huge pony coming off,
you know the soul--


67
0:3:17,73 --> 0:3:19,87
you know I'm hardcore, I listen
to punk rock music, I


68
0:3:19,87 --> 0:3:25,8
skateboard, but I'm
also very soulful.


69
0:3:25,8 --> 0:3:27,45
He's just looking off into the
distance like, you don't even


70
0:3:27,45 --> 0:3:30,37
know what I'm looking at right
now, what I'm looking at is


71
0:3:30,37 --> 0:3:35,1
totally heavy, and
you have no idea.


72
0:3:35,1 --> 0:3:37,97
It was freaking awesome.


73
0:3:37,97 --> 0:3:39,9
BRYAN IGUCHI: I guess--


74
0:3:39,9 --> 0:3:40,74
once I got out of junior--


75
0:3:40,74 --> 0:3:42,36
Well I did that, it's mostly
junior college, and once I got


76
0:3:42,36 --> 0:3:44,62
out and moved up to Big Bear,
and that was kind of the


77
0:3:44,62 --> 0:3:46,92
beginning of snowboard parks.


78
0:3:46,92 --> 0:3:50,54
That was the first time that a
mountain had given like full


79
0:3:50,54 --> 0:3:52,36
permission to just build jumps,


80
0:3:52,36 --> 0:3:54,51
and build these features.


81
0:3:54,51 --> 0:3:56,72
And no one really knew how--


82
0:3:56,72 --> 0:3:58,94
we didn't really know at the
time how big to build them or


83
0:3:58,94 --> 0:4:2,48
what really kind of features,
so we started experimenting.


84
0:4:2,48 --> 0:4:5,31
The technical aspect of it
was just accelerating.


85
0:4:5,31 --> 0:4:8,66
It was like we've built this
like skate park, where it was


86
0:4:8,66 --> 0:4:12,12
like kind of bowled corners and
banks long runs, and then


87
0:4:12,12 --> 0:4:14,56
gaps, and then we put up
rails, and everything.


88
0:4:14,56 --> 0:4:16,959
The riders around were just-- it
seemed like every day there


89
0:4:16,959 --> 0:4:20,91
was some new trick going on or
there was just really intense


90
0:4:20,91 --> 0:4:23,49
amount of progression happening
in that park.


91
0:4:23,49 --> 0:4:24,92
DAVE DOWNING: Bear Mountain
was like the only real


92
0:4:24,92 --> 0:4:25,6
snowboard park.


93
0:4:25,6 --> 0:4:28,44
Like they're building jumps
and Mike Parillo was like


94
0:4:28,44 --> 0:4:31,79
digging this half pipe with
a chainsaw, it was


95
0:4:31,79 --> 0:4:34,1
pretty raw back then.


96
0:4:34,1 --> 0:4:37,32
And Bryan was just definitely
the innovator of the whole


97
0:4:37,32 --> 0:4:38,2
group there.


98
0:4:38,2 --> 0:4:42,2
He started doing those like
shifty backside 180s off these


99
0:4:42,2 --> 0:4:46,12
hips and stuff and I remember
just everybody trying to do


100
0:4:46,12 --> 0:4:48,38
shifty backside 180s like
Bryan Iguchi did.


101
0:4:48,38 --> 0:4:51,92
There's this one rainbow rail
that is pretty famous, it was


102
0:4:51,92 --> 0:4:54,825
like a piece of a chair lift
tower that was just laying in


103
0:4:54,825 --> 0:4:57,53
some scrap pile and Parillo like
drug it out and stuck it


104
0:4:57,53 --> 0:4:58,12
in the snow.


105
0:4:58,12 --> 0:5:1,0
That was like one of the first
like metal rails in a


106
0:5:1,0 --> 0:5:5,88
snowboard park, Bryan used to
just kill all that stuff.


107
0:5:5,88 --> 0:5:8,66
BRYAN IGUCHI: The word got out
then people from all over the


108
0:5:8,66 --> 0:5:9,62
place were coming down.


109
0:5:9,62 --> 0:5:12,425
There was people from the
Northwest and East coast, and


110
0:5:12,425 --> 0:5:14,11
then people from Europe,
and we kind of--


111
0:5:14,11 --> 0:5:18,55
the snowboard park just caught
on and pretty much changed the


112
0:5:18,55 --> 0:5:20,44
way people were snowboarding.


113
0:5:20,44 --> 0:5:25,25
It really blew up and it
created the X Games.


114
0:5:25,25 --> 0:5:27,93
It just kind of created this
environment where snowboarding


115
0:5:27,93 --> 0:5:32,39
could really progress on a
level where there is--


116
0:5:32,39 --> 0:5:37,1
there was a lot of spectators,
and events, and things.


117
0:5:37,1 --> 0:5:40,95
It seemed like a lot of things
were happening at that time.


118
0:5:40,95 --> 0:5:41,52
TERJE HAAKONSEN: He would
always do something


119
0:5:41,52 --> 0:5:42,77
amazing on the board.


120
0:5:42,77 --> 0:5:45,1



121
0:5:45,1 --> 0:5:48,41
He was like the guy who could
do a lot out of little.


122
0:5:48,41 --> 0:5:52,85
Guch was really into spinning
and all the little jib things,


123
0:5:52,85 --> 0:5:56,0
he was a really good
skateboarder, still is.


124
0:5:56,0 --> 0:5:58,55
So there was a lot of
jibonks and lot of


125
0:5:58,55 --> 0:6:2,6
tail and nose maneuvers.


126
0:6:2,6 --> 0:6:3,9
BILLY ANDERSON: I guess like one
of his influential things


127
0:6:3,9 --> 0:6:6,7
too were just like all the
nose butter stuff.


128
0:6:6,7 --> 0:6:9,64
Like that was one of his deals
just like spinning around from


129
0:6:9,64 --> 0:6:12,84
his tip to his tail, and
ollieing, and bouncing around


130
0:6:12,84 --> 0:6:16,9
with one foot, that was
all stuff that no


131
0:6:16,9 --> 0:6:18,92
one had really done.


132
0:6:18,92 --> 0:6:20,85
BRYAN IGUCHI: It was probably
two months after I moved to


133
0:6:20,85 --> 0:6:27,17
Big Bear, there was a big pipe
contest at Snow Summit, and I


134
0:6:27,17 --> 0:6:29,73
was living in my Jeep and
whatever, and I really wanted


135
0:6:29,73 --> 0:6:30,71
to do this contest.


136
0:6:30,71 --> 0:6:32,9
I got started--


137
0:6:32,9 --> 0:6:35,93
ride the bunch and felt like
maybe I could do--


138
0:6:35,93 --> 0:6:38,99
maybe I could go pro
or whatever, that's


139
0:6:38,99 --> 0:6:40,63
what I wanted to do.


140
0:6:40,63 --> 0:6:44,45
It was the first pro contest I
entered and halfway down my


141
0:6:44,45 --> 0:6:46,63
first run my binding
broke, and I didn't


142
0:6:46,63 --> 0:6:48,11
qualify for the event.


143
0:6:48,11 --> 0:6:51,62
And I was so bummed,
wasted that money.


144
0:6:51,62 --> 0:6:55,12
I don't even know what I was
thinking, I was just pissed.


145
0:6:55,12 --> 0:6:58,23
Next day, I went out and I was
just riding the pipe at Bear


146
0:6:58,23 --> 0:7:0,77
Mountain, just doing my
thing, just sessioning


147
0:7:0,77 --> 0:7:1,73
with a couple friends.


148
0:7:1,73 --> 0:7:4,3
It was a nice day and
the pipe was good.


149
0:7:4,3 --> 0:7:7,51
So I was having a good session,
and went to take a


150
0:7:7,51 --> 0:7:10,605
break to grab some water, and
Tim Pogue was the team manager


151
0:7:10,605 --> 0:7:13,32
of Burton snowboards and he
was there with some of the


152
0:7:13,32 --> 0:7:19,6
team and had seen me ride during
the contest, or in the


153
0:7:19,6 --> 0:7:21,595
practice for the contest in that
morning, and approached


154
0:7:21,595 --> 0:7:25,56
me and gave me his business
card, and said, give me a call


155
0:7:25,56 --> 0:7:28,14
in two weeks, I'll be in
the office and I'd


156
0:7:28,14 --> 0:7:29,7
love to help you out.


157
0:7:29,7 --> 0:7:31,26
BILLY ANDERSON: It's kind of
crazy because when I think


158
0:7:31,26 --> 0:7:34,26
about it I don't think of him
as really a progressive pipe


159
0:7:34,26 --> 0:7:35,8
rider for the time.


160
0:7:35,8 --> 0:7:37,81
But then when you start talking
about it, he was one


161
0:7:37,81 --> 0:7:41,845
of the ones that was really
pushing it at those times.


162
0:7:41,845 --> 0:7:45,15
The early-- and I think it's
in A Lively Ride, he does a


163
0:7:45,15 --> 0:7:50,4
cab nine in the pipe, and a
bunch of switch stuff, and a


164
0:7:50,4 --> 0:7:51,44
ton of spinning.


165
0:7:51,44 --> 0:7:53,55
I think he was one of the first
ones to really kind of


166
0:7:53,55 --> 0:7:56,58
take that up and I think, Hard
The Hungry and The Homeless, I


167
0:7:56,58 --> 0:7:58,69
think he was doing some 900s.


168
0:7:58,69 --> 0:8:1,2
PAT BRIDGES: But he was also--


169
0:8:1,2 --> 0:8:3,965
in A Lively Ride, he was doing
Alley-Oop McTwists and tail


170
0:8:3,965 --> 0:8:5,48
grabs on this quarter pipe that
couldn't have been more


171
0:8:5,48 --> 0:8:7,86
than six feet wide
and 10 feet tall.


172
0:8:7,86 --> 0:8:11,18
It was really, really
impressive to see.


173
0:8:11,18 --> 0:8:13,69
I mean here's a guy who was
buttering, he was trying to


174
0:8:13,69 --> 0:8:17,33
hook 1080s, 9s, off
of everything.


175
0:8:17,33 --> 0:8:20,22
And he was ruling on McTwists
and stuff like


176
0:8:20,22 --> 0:8:22,84
that, it was sick.


177
0:8:22,84 --> 0:8:25,45
DAVE DOWNING: That's when he
was filming The Hard, The


178
0:8:25,45 --> 0:8:26,45
Hungry, and The Homeless.


179
0:8:26,45 --> 0:8:29,71
And then after that, Burton
brought Bryan


180
0:8:29,71 --> 0:8:31,1
in and helped him--


181
0:8:31,1 --> 0:8:34,6
Bryan helped Burton develop
the twin, which was that


182
0:8:34,6 --> 0:8:38,26
question mark Ouija twin
that was pretty famous.


183
0:8:38,26 --> 0:8:40,27
BRYAN IGUCHI: I think it was
early enough in snowboarding


184
0:8:40,27 --> 0:8:41,65
there was a big change
happening.


185
0:8:41,65 --> 0:8:43,75
It was kind of one of those
things you go, well here go


186
0:8:43,75 --> 0:8:46,16
travel with Mack dog
and go film, and


187
0:8:46,16 --> 0:8:47,34
then go to these contests.


188
0:8:47,34 --> 0:8:49,263
So we filmed between the
contests and kind


189
0:8:49,263 --> 0:8:50,2
of just road tripped.


190
0:8:50,2 --> 0:8:51,69
I just jumped in the car
with him, we drove


191
0:8:51,69 --> 0:8:53,32
from event to event.


192
0:8:53,32 --> 0:8:56,13
But it was more of the filming,
we would go out and


193
0:8:56,13 --> 0:8:58,2
film, hook up with locals
at different


194
0:8:58,2 --> 0:9:0,0
places and go film stuff.


195
0:9:0,0 --> 0:9:2,81
And the project turned out to
be The Hard, The Hungry, and


196
0:9:2,81 --> 0:9:4,5
The Homeless, that was
the first snowboard


197
0:9:4,5 --> 0:9:6,95
film I'd worked on.


198
0:9:6,95 --> 0:9:9,69
That was where my career kind
of shifted to is more the


199
0:9:9,69 --> 0:9:12,26
filming stuff, it was
just kind of--


200
0:9:12,26 --> 0:9:16,23
that was gaining in popularity
more than the events.


201
0:9:16,23 --> 0:9:20,79
The events were kind of you know
I would say pretty well


202
0:9:20,79 --> 0:9:23,97
dominated by Terje
and everyone.


203
0:9:23,97 --> 0:9:26,385
And it was just more of a--


204
0:9:26,385 --> 0:9:30,39
I don't know, it just seemed
like it was a better


205
0:9:30,39 --> 0:9:31,59
opportunity for me.


206
0:9:31,59 --> 0:9:32,56
DAVE DOWNING: Guchi
seemed like he


207
0:9:32,56 --> 0:9:33,65
just came out of nowhere.


208
0:9:33,65 --> 0:9:37,92
And it's interesting because
all the other riders, they


209
0:9:37,92 --> 0:9:40,73
still had to do contests and
stuff, with the exception of


210
0:9:40,73 --> 0:9:42,54
like Damian, and those guys.


211
0:9:42,54 --> 0:9:44,85
But he was the first pure
freestyler who actually just


212
0:9:44,85 --> 0:9:49,85
seemed like first he did movies,
then he did contests.


213
0:9:49,85 --> 0:9:51,13
BRYAN IGUCHI: I've never
had the best


214
0:9:51,13 --> 0:9:54,39
luck with the contests.


215
0:9:54,39 --> 0:10:0,12
I ended up feeling frustrated
a lot at contests.


216
0:10:0,12 --> 0:10:1,74
It's just one of those
things, I don't think


217
0:10:1,74 --> 0:10:4,36
competition's easy.


218
0:10:4,36 --> 0:10:9,62
I remember Dave Seoane came up
to me at the ASR show in San


219
0:10:9,62 --> 0:10:15,4
Diego and he said he had
this concept for


220
0:10:15,4 --> 0:10:15,8
this snowboard movie.


221
0:10:15,8 --> 0:10:19,18
We're going to all jump in these
Cadillacs, and drive


222
0:10:19,18 --> 0:10:20,98
around, and road trip around
the states, and make a


223
0:10:20,98 --> 0:10:23,306
snowboard movie.


224
0:10:23,306 --> 0:10:25,415
I'm like that sounds awesome,
who's going to go?


225
0:10:25,415 --> 0:10:28,8
He's like well I got Terje, and
Ranquet, and John Cardiel,


226
0:10:28,8 --> 0:10:29,9
I was like done,
let's do this.


227
0:10:29,9 --> 0:10:33,58
We'd go shred all these spots
but then we'd go skate as


228
0:10:33,58 --> 0:10:35,3
much, if not more.


229
0:10:35,3 --> 0:10:40,49
It was like on that trip, I
remember skating Burnside with


230
0:10:40,49 --> 0:10:43,94
him, and some mini ramps
in Colorado.


231
0:10:43,94 --> 0:10:46,65
And just everywhere we went
there was like-- we would hook


232
0:10:46,65 --> 0:10:48,47
up with the skaters or we
would hook up with the


233
0:10:48,47 --> 0:10:51,11
snowboarders, or whatever.


234
0:10:51,11 --> 0:10:52,93
It was a really cool time.


235
0:10:52,93 --> 0:10:55,61
DAVE DOWNING: He basically
took off with Dave Seoane


236
0:10:55,61 --> 0:11:1,19
during the Roadkill filming
sessions, he was gone for a


237
0:11:1,19 --> 0:11:2,85
couple months.


238
0:11:2,85 --> 0:11:4,75
I didn't even know what was
going on until that movie came


239
0:11:4,75 --> 0:11:8,42
out and then I was like, whoa
Bryan was doing that, it's


240
0:11:8,42 --> 0:11:9,545
pretty sick.


241
0:11:9,545 --> 0:11:11,785
PAT BRIDGES: And then you saw
him in the Vulcan movies.


242
0:11:11,785 --> 0:11:15,18
A Lively Ride, was the first
Vulcan film I saw him in, and


243
0:11:15,18 --> 0:11:19,21
then obviously he had a lot
of clips in The Garden.


244
0:11:19,21 --> 0:11:21,77
BRYAN IGUCHI: Throughout the
process of making it, we just


245
0:11:21,77 --> 0:11:24,42
kind of went out, OK we're doing
Vulcan snow project, and


246
0:11:24,42 --> 0:11:27,26
Wooly the owner, he'd be out
in the field with us in the


247
0:11:27,26 --> 0:11:32,91
back country hiking filming the
super 8 and Troy Eckert.


248
0:11:32,91 --> 0:11:36,97
It kind of all came together at
Sonora Pass in California


249
0:11:36,97 --> 0:11:38,54
and that's where we came up
with the name, The Garden.


250
0:11:38,54 --> 0:11:41,72
We would go up there, we'd camp,
and hike these jumps,


251
0:11:41,72 --> 0:11:44,57
and we'd have these amazing
sessions where it would be


252
0:11:44,57 --> 0:11:48,81
exhausting long days, hiking
around, and just having a


253
0:11:48,81 --> 0:11:52,25
blast, and sitting around the
campfire at night telling


254
0:11:52,25 --> 0:11:55,14
stories, laughing,
and partying just


255
0:11:55,14 --> 0:11:56,48
having a good time.


256
0:11:56,48 --> 0:12:0,285
That's when we were like this is
the butterfly garden, this


257
0:12:0,285 --> 0:12:2,54
is The Garden.


258
0:12:2,54 --> 0:12:6,85
This is the movie, this movie's
about this, this is


259
0:12:6,85 --> 0:12:8,6
what snowboarding is about.


260
0:12:8,6 --> 0:12:10,24
It's hanging out with your
friends, and going out and


261
0:12:10,24 --> 0:12:13,87
finding these places
that are special.


262
0:12:13,87 --> 0:12:16,6
It was a really kind of a
liberating experience for all


263
0:12:16,6 --> 0:12:19,79
of us to be able to get out from
the ski resorts, from the


264
0:12:19,79 --> 0:12:23,15
crowds, and from the
crazy park scene


265
0:12:23,15 --> 0:12:24,445
that was blowing up.


266
0:12:24,445 --> 0:12:27,87
I mean, making The Garden was
probably still to this day the


267
0:12:27,87 --> 0:12:29,4
highlight of my snowboarding
career.


268
0:12:29,4 --> 0:12:33,55
It kind of got me inspired to
continue to search, and


269
0:12:33,55 --> 0:12:35,85
explore, and recreate that
kind of feeling.


270
0:12:35,85 --> 0:12:40,3
And been trying to keep that
dream alive by riding.


271
0:12:40,3 --> 0:14:40,3
