ROYCE AKERS: Hey, this
is Royce Akers.


3
0:0:3,54 --> 0:0:5,88
A few months back, we heard
about a crazy race in Mongolia


4
0:0:5,88 --> 0:0:8,47
where nomadic cowboys raced
giant long-horned yaks across


5
0:0:8,47 --> 0:0:9,41
the steppe.


6
0:0:9,41 --> 0:0:10,68
This sounded pretty wild.


7
0:0:10,68 --> 0:0:12,95
And we don't have any yaks in
Australia, so we thought that


8
0:0:12,95 --> 0:0:14,84
was enough of a reason
to go check it out.


9
0:0:14,84 --> 0:0:17,52
We got on a plane in Melbourne
and flew 14 hours to a tiny


10
0:0:17,52 --> 0:0:19,58
airport near the
Russian border.


11
0:0:19,58 --> 0:0:21,46
We then drove half a day across
dirt tracks where the


12
0:0:21,46 --> 0:0:24,76
vast emptiness made us feel
totally insignificant.


13
0:0:24,76 --> 0:0:27,45
Finally, we found a bunch of
Mongolian herders in a field


14
0:0:27,45 --> 0:0:30,28
surrounded by 500 of the finest
yaks in the country.


15
0:0:30,28 --> 0:0:36,1



16
0:0:36,1 --> 0:0:39,66
OK, we are in Khovsgol Province,
which is about 1,200


17
0:0:39,66 --> 0:0:43,31
kilometers from the capital,
Ulan Bator.


18
0:0:43,31 --> 0:0:47,55
And we're at the second annual
Yak Festival, which is a big


19
0:0:47,55 --> 0:0:49,19
deal if you're into yaks.


20
0:0:49,19 --> 0:0:52,99
-My yak six old.


21
0:0:52,99 --> 0:0:53,24
ROYCE AKERS: Six years?


22
0:0:53,24 --> 0:0:54,2
-Yeah, six.


23
0:0:54,2 --> 0:0:55,36
ROYCE AKERS: How old are you?


24
0:0:55,36 --> 0:0:55,837
-I?


25
0:0:55,837 --> 0:0:56,314
ROYCE AKERS: Yeah.


26
0:0:56,314 --> 0:0:57,764
-I 22 years old.


27
0:0:57,764 --> 0:0:58,258
ROYCE AKERS: 22.


28
0:0:58,258 --> 0:0:59,508
Sweet.


29
0:0:59,508 --> 0:1:1,72



30
0:1:1,72 --> 0:1:4,129
The yak is pretty much
Mongolia's national animal.


31
0:1:4,129 --> 0:1:6,42
This goes back centuries to when
Genghis Khan laid waste


32
0:1:6,42 --> 0:1:9,22
to most of Europe and Asia in
a giant yak-drawn tent,


33
0:1:9,22 --> 0:1:11,93
leaving a bloody trail of
hoof prints in his wake.


34
0:1:11,93 --> 0:1:14,39
Yak Festival aims to celebrate
that macho heritage with a


35
0:1:14,39 --> 0:1:16,59
range of yak-related
activities.


36
0:1:16,59 --> 0:1:18,5
We were told that they would
climax in an epic yak race


37
0:1:18,5 --> 0:1:21,706
across the steppe, which
was the reason we came.


38
0:1:21,706 --> 0:1:23,64
Here we are with the owner
of one of last


39
0:1:23,64 --> 0:1:25,76
year's winning yaks.


40
0:1:25,76 --> 0:1:27,31
He's going to tell us about some
of the medals that he's


41
0:1:27,31 --> 0:1:30,66
won through yak racing
and yak pulling.

43

44
0:1:47,1 --> 0:1:48,86
ROYCE AKERS: As you can see,
yak sports are reserved for


45
0:1:48,86 --> 0:1:51,6
macho guys like this one.


46
0:1:51,6 --> 0:1:52,29
Horse racing is a little
different.


47
0:1:52,29 --> 0:1:55,5
Hey, can you tell
us where we are?


48
0:1:55,5 --> 0:1:58,8
TOOGII UNBANYAMBA: We
are in Tuv province.


49
0:1:58,8 --> 0:1:58,82
ROYCE AKERS: It's
kind of amazing.


50
0:1:58,82 --> 0:2:2,48
There are no trees at all.


51
0:2:2,48 --> 0:2:6,25
And everywhere you look is
just mountains and grass.


52
0:2:6,25 --> 0:2:8,699
So tell us about this
horse race.


53
0:2:8,699 --> 0:2:10,47
UUGII UNBANYAMBA: The five
years old horses


54
0:2:10,47 --> 0:2:11,98
are going to race.


55
0:2:11,98 --> 0:2:15,85
And the interesting thing
about the five years old


56
0:2:15,85 --> 0:2:19,41
horses is that this
the age when the


57
0:2:19,41 --> 0:2:21,41
horses are the fastest.


58
0:2:21,41 --> 0:2:24,19
ROYCE AKERS: So who's going
to be riding the horses?


59
0:2:24,19 --> 0:2:28,66
UUGII UNBANYAMBA: Like kids
from five to 12 years old.


60
0:2:28,66 --> 0:2:29,6
ROYCE AKERS: How many horses
are going to be


61
0:2:29,6 --> 0:2:30,96
taking off at once?


62
0:2:30,96 --> 0:2:33,43
UUGII UNBANYAMBA: Today I heard
there going to be more


63
0:2:33,43 --> 0:2:53,9
than 300 horses.


64
0:2:53,9 --> 0:2:55,58
ROYCE AKERS: So this is the
finish of the race.


65
0:2:55,58 --> 0:2:59,14
We were at the start, and we
were filming some of the stuff


66
0:2:59,14 --> 0:3:1,2
going on, and all of a sudden
it was on, and it was just a


67
0:3:1,2 --> 0:3:2,44
cloud of dust.


68
0:3:2,44 --> 0:3:5,6
And so we jumped in the car and
drove the 25 kilometers as


69
0:3:5,6 --> 0:3:6,54
fast as we could.


70
0:3:6,54 --> 0:3:9,92
But we ran into some traffic and
whatever, so this is all


71
0:3:9,92 --> 0:3:11,82
that's left of the race--


72
0:3:11,82 --> 0:3:14,97
this straggler over here.


73
0:3:14,97 --> 0:3:18,43
But they don't actually call
the loser "the loser." They


74
0:3:18,43 --> 0:3:19,775
have some other name for it.


75
0:3:19,775 --> 0:3:22,14
It would kind of suck if you
were the last of 200 horses,


76
0:3:22,14 --> 0:3:27,58
but they somehow make it
all right for the kids.


77
0:3:27,58 --> 0:3:32,33
OK, we're in Khovsgol Province
with Toogii's family.


78
0:3:32,33 --> 0:3:34,2
And we're going to check out
some of the products we can


79
0:3:34,2 --> 0:3:36,9
make with yak milk.


80
0:3:36,9 --> 0:3:40,79
Could you tell us what
we have in this one?

ROYCE AKERS: The curd tastes
like dry, chewy, yogurt.


84
0:3:55,512 --> 0:3:59,9
And the cheese kind of like
Parmesan, but not as salty.

it's just like cream.

95
0:4:39,3 --> 0:4:41,8
Between events, the crowd was
treated to a few bouts of


96
0:4:41,8 --> 0:4:44,8
Mongolian wrestling.


97
0:4:44,8 --> 0:4:46,84
It turns out Mongolians are
exceptionally good at not


98
0:4:46,84 --> 0:4:49,56
being pushed over, which makes
some matches about as exciting


99
0:4:49,56 --> 0:4:51,58
as televised golf.


100
0:4:51,58 --> 0:4:53,65
It was during one of these
extended bouts that we noticed


101
0:4:53,65 --> 0:4:55,4
a crowd rushing down the hill.


102
0:4:55,4 --> 0:4:57,66
We turned around just in time
to see the last 100 metes of


103
0:4:57,66 --> 0:4:59,1
the yak race.


104
0:4:59,1 --> 0:5:1,57
It was pretty unruly and a lot
less epic than it sounded on


105
0:5:1,57 --> 0:5:2,6
the brochure.


106
0:5:2,6 --> 0:5:4,13
The riders found it
tough keeping the


107
0:5:4,13 --> 0:5:5,3
yaks running straight.


108
0:5:5,3 --> 0:5:6,58
And to be honest, they probably


109
0:5:6,58 --> 0:5:8,24
could have jogged faster.


110
0:5:8,24 --> 0:5:11,6
Still, a race is a race, and
the winners were celebrated

their grass and dream of
