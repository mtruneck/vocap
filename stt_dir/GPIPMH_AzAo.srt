SPIKE JONZE: (SINGING)
a salaam aleikum.


3
0:0:4,24 --> 0:0:7,67
A salaam aleikum.


4
0:0:7,67 --> 0:0:11,1
A salaam aleikum, come on!


5
0:0:11,1 --> 0:0:13,6
A salaam aleikum.


6
0:0:13,6 --> 0:0:13,55
Louder!


7
0:0:13,55 --> 0:0:16,49
A salaam aleikum.


8
0:0:16,49 --> 0:0:19,92
A salaam aleikum.


9
0:0:19,92 --> 0:0:23,35
SHANE SMITH: A salaam aleikum.


10
0:0:23,35 --> 0:0:25,81
SHANE SMITH: A salaam aleikum.


11
0:0:25,81 --> 0:0:26,888
[INAUDIBLE]


12
0:0:26,888 --> 0:0:28,88
MALE SPEAKER: Bye.


13
0:0:28,88 --> 0:0:29,66
SPIKE JONZE: They
were starting to


14
0:0:29,66 --> 0:0:30,91
open the door to leave.


15
0:0:30,91 --> 0:0:43,4



16
0:0:43,4 --> 0:0:47,92
We are in the Socotra, which is
an island a two hour flight


17
0:0:47,92 --> 0:0:50,45
of the coast of Yemen
in the Indian Ocean.


18
0:0:50,45 --> 0:0:50,92
And--


19
0:0:50,92 --> 0:0:52,285
SHANE SMITH: It's
hot as balls.


20
0:0:52,285 --> 0:0:53,44
SPIKE JONZE: It's hot as--


21
0:0:53,44 --> 0:0:54,35
it's hot.


22
0:0:54,35 --> 0:0:57,14
Yeah, this is a pre-historic
land because it broke off from


23
0:0:57,14 --> 0:1:0,57
the continent of Africa at least
two million years ago,


24
0:1:0,57 --> 0:1:4,83
and so all the has evolved
on its own trajectory.


25
0:1:4,83 --> 0:1:7,39
And so you have incredibly
exotic trees--


26
0:1:7,39 --> 0:1:9,21
SHANE SMITH: We're going to see
the blood tree right now.


27
0:1:9,21 --> 0:1:12,86
SPIKE JONZE: A tree that
bleeds dragon's blood.


28
0:1:12,86 --> 0:1:17,66
We came to Yemen to do a story
on, basically, the truth or


29
0:1:17,66 --> 0:1:20,565
untruth of al-Qaeda in Yemen.


30
0:1:20,565 --> 0:1:22,51
But Shane was like, if we're
going to Yemen, we have to go


31
0:1:22,51 --> 0:1:23,42
to the Socotra.


32
0:1:23,42 --> 0:1:25,47
I don't care, I'll
buy a helicopter.


33
0:1:25,47 --> 0:1:29,86
And so, based on Shane's
demands, we took two days to


34
0:1:29,86 --> 0:1:33,51
go to this pre-historic land
of the lost island.


35
0:1:33,51 --> 0:1:33,78
and--


36
0:1:33,78 --> 0:1:35,94
SHANE SMITH: But since it's
two hours drive in the hot


37
0:1:35,94 --> 0:1:38,7
heat, we decided to do
a Spike [INAUDIBLE]


38
0:1:38,7 --> 0:1:39,498
spend Saturday with.


39
0:1:39,498 --> 0:1:46,638



40
0:1:46,638 --> 0:1:50,22
So how does this dagger
look, shitty or good?


41
0:1:50,22 --> 0:1:52,7
SPIKE JONZE: We're doing the
official, full blown,


42
0:1:52,7 --> 0:1:55,38
deconstructed, "Rolling Stone,"


43
0:1:55,38 --> 0:1:58,211
"Playboy," Shane Smith interview.


44
0:1:58,211 --> 0:2:1,71
We're going to get to know every
inch of your cranium and


45
0:2:1,71 --> 0:2:4,34
body by the end of
this interview.


46
0:2:4,34 --> 0:2:6,192
SHANE SMITH: Are we going
to touch moles?


47
0:2:6,192 --> 0:2:7,442
SPIKE JONZE: Probably.


48
0:2:7,442 --> 0:2:11,74



49
0:2:11,74 --> 0:2:17,19
Your one of the driving forces
behind this whole Vice thing.


50
0:2:17,19 --> 0:2:19,25
SHANE SMITH: Yeah.


51
0:2:19,25 --> 0:2:21,76
SPIKE JONZE: Yeah, why
did you start Vice?


52
0:2:21,76 --> 0:2:23,26
SHANE SMITH: Because I
couldn't get a job.


53
0:2:23,26 --> 0:2:24,7
SPIKE JONZE: Where
were you living?


54
0:2:24,7 --> 0:2:28,16
SHANE SMITH: I was living in
Budapest being a criminal.


55
0:2:28,16 --> 0:2:29,71
And I came back for my
brother's wedding.


56
0:2:29,71 --> 0:2:31,64
SPIKE JONZE: What kind
of criminal?


57
0:2:31,64 --> 0:2:32,98
SHANE SMITH: You know,
buying and selling


58
0:2:32,98 --> 0:2:34,84
money illegally, arbitrage.


59
0:2:34,84 --> 0:2:36,8
SPIKE JONZE: What's that mean?


60
0:2:36,8 --> 0:2:37,835
SHANE SMITH: Buying and selling
money illegally.


61
0:2:37,835 --> 0:2:39,5
SPIKE JONZE: [LAUGH]


62
0:2:39,5 --> 0:2:41,73
SHANE SMITH: And I came back for
my brother's wedding and I


63
0:2:41,73 --> 0:2:45,39
met Saroosh Alvi, who was
just out of rehab.


64
0:2:45,39 --> 0:2:47,6
And I was on acid.


65
0:2:47,6 --> 0:2:49,77
And I was like, oh, you're
from Pakistan.


66
0:2:49,77 --> 0:2:52,49
I'll show you how to throw a
googly, which is the type of


67
0:2:52,49 --> 0:2:53,47
Cricket throw.


68
0:2:53,47 --> 0:2:55,45
SPIKE JONZE: Yeah, how
old were you guys?


69
0:2:55,45 --> 0:2:56,55
SHANE SMITH: 24.


70
0:2:56,55 --> 0:2:57,7
I was 24.


71
0:2:57,7 --> 0:2:59,4
Saroosh was 25.


72
0:2:59,4 --> 0:3:0,85
And then we became
best buddies.


73
0:3:0,85 --> 0:3:3,46
And then we were working at
a place called "Voice of


74
0:3:3,46 --> 0:3:6,8
Montreal." It was a make work
project for Haitian


75
0:3:6,8 --> 0:3:9,47
immigrants and us.


76
0:3:9,47 --> 0:3:12,13
And then, after a while, they
owed us money, and they


77
0:3:12,13 --> 0:3:13,4
couldn't pay us,
so we took it.


78
0:3:13,4 --> 0:3:15,43
And we dropped the O, and we
called it "Vice." And then


79
0:3:15,43 --> 0:3:16,45
that was it.


80
0:3:16,45 --> 0:3:18,77
SPIKE JONZE: So you stole the
magazines from a nonprofit


81
0:3:18,77 --> 0:3:20,76
organization that was trying
to help Haitians.


82
0:3:20,76 --> 0:3:21,58
SHANE SMITH: Correct.


83
0:3:21,58 --> 0:3:24,36
SPIKE JONZE: Dude, that's
kind of not that nice.


84
0:3:24,36 --> 0:3:27,55
SHANE SMITH: Yeah, and we
were on welfare, too.


85
0:3:27,55 --> 0:3:29,27
The government paid for us.


86
0:3:29,27 --> 0:3:29,92
SPIKE JONZE: Wow.


87
0:3:29,92 --> 0:3:30,52
SHANE SMITH: Yes.


88
0:3:30,52 --> 0:3:31,24
SPIKE JONZE: Then what?


89
0:3:31,24 --> 0:3:35,85
SHANE SMITH: So in 1998, when
we came down to the States.


90
0:3:35,85 --> 0:3:37,85
Well so, we were interviewed
by a newspaper.


91
0:3:37,85 --> 0:3:39,69
We made up this story
that Larry Flint was


92
0:3:39,69 --> 0:3:41,14
going to buy us.


93
0:3:41,14 --> 0:3:43,33
And there was something that
someone else, named Conrad,


94
0:3:43,33 --> 0:3:45,9
and then this guy named Richard
Szalwinski, who was


95
0:3:45,9 --> 0:3:48,92
like the richest guy in
Montreal, Richard Szalwinski


96
0:3:48,92 --> 0:3:51,73
read it in the newspaper, and he
called us and he said, who


97
0:3:51,73 --> 0:3:53,25
are you fucking guys?


98
0:3:53,25 --> 0:3:55,85
So we went to lunch at his
restaurant and someone came in


99
0:3:55,85 --> 0:3:58,28
saying, Shane's hung
over or something.


100
0:3:58,28 --> 0:3:59,56
And he goes, oh you drink?


101
0:3:59,56 --> 0:4:0,39
I said, oh, I can drink.


102
0:4:0,39 --> 0:4:2,34
He goes, OK, drink that
bottle of whiskey.


103
0:4:2,34 --> 0:4:5,23
And I drank half the bottle of
Jack Daniels and then had to


104
0:4:5,23 --> 0:4:7,83
sit there at lunch and
negotiate with him.


105
0:4:7,83 --> 0:4:10,56
And so he's like, we talked to
him for the lunch, and he


106
0:4:10,56 --> 0:4:11,0
goes, it's a Friday.


107
0:4:11,0 --> 0:4:13,26
And he goes, OK, I want to
see you guys Monday.


108
0:4:13,26 --> 0:4:15,63
I want to be your partner.


109
0:4:15,63 --> 0:4:17,62
So we went away on
the weekend.


110
0:4:17,62 --> 0:4:18,97
And we know how to
value a company,


111
0:4:18,97 --> 0:4:19,98
we didn't know anything.


112
0:4:19,98 --> 0:4:21,51
And we have the paper
somewhere.


113
0:4:21,51 --> 0:4:23,14
It's called the Price of Vice.


114
0:4:23,14 --> 0:4:25,412
And it's got doodles
all over it.


115
0:4:25,412 --> 0:4:29,76
And it was basically, we're
so stupid, it was like, so


116
0:4:29,76 --> 0:4:30,96
there's three of us, right?


117
0:4:30,96 --> 0:4:33,38
The fourth partner
to come in at an


118
0:4:33,38 --> 0:4:36,4
equal share is $1 million.


119
0:4:36,4 --> 0:4:38,405
So that valued it at $4 million,
and we would get the


120
0:4:38,405 --> 0:4:38,95
$1 million.


121
0:4:38,95 --> 0:4:40,53
Because it was worth nothing.


122
0:4:40,53 --> 0:4:42,26
It was worth, I mean,
whatever.


123
0:4:42,26 --> 0:4:43,64
So he looked at it.


124
0:4:43,64 --> 0:4:44,74
He said that's a lot of money.


125
0:4:44,74 --> 0:4:45,86
He signed it, I don't
know why.


126
0:4:45,86 --> 0:4:46,87
He signed it.


127
0:4:46,87 --> 0:4:48,54
And we just got whisked
off, and all his


128
0:4:48,54 --> 0:4:50,3
minion gave us money.


129
0:4:50,3 --> 0:4:52,62
And they give us $50,000 each,
just to hold us over until we


130
0:4:52,62 --> 0:4:53,75
got all the rest of the money.


131
0:4:53,75 --> 0:4:54,58
And we didn't know what to do.


132
0:4:54,58 --> 0:4:57,143
I remember running in circles
outside screaming at the top


133
0:4:57,143 --> 0:4:59,7
of my lungs.


134
0:4:59,7 --> 0:5:0,92
Because none of us had
ever had any money.


135
0:5:0,92 --> 0:5:4,62
So then he brought us down to
New York for the e-commerce


136
0:5:4,62 --> 0:5:7,3
dot-com revolution thing
in the '90s.


137
0:5:7,3 --> 0:5:11,18
And so we came down, and we were
sort of fascinated with


138
0:5:11,18 --> 0:5:16,72
cocaine, and supermodels, and
street wear, and just shit.


139
0:5:16,72 --> 0:5:19,95
We were like we're so rich,
we're so rich, it's crazy,


140
0:5:19,95 --> 0:5:20,88
dot-com, hooray.


141
0:5:20,88 --> 0:5:23,13
And then obviously, boom.


142
0:5:23,13 --> 0:5:24,68
He had about 25 companies.


143
0:5:24,68 --> 0:5:25,86
And they all went bankrupt.


144
0:5:25,86 --> 0:5:28,1
And we were the only company
that didn't go bankrupt.


145
0:5:28,1 --> 0:5:30,6
SPIKE JONZE: And how did you get
it back from [INAUDIBLE]?


146
0:5:30,6 --> 0:5:31,65
SHANE SMITH: We bought
it back.


147
0:5:31,65 --> 0:5:33,42
That's a long story, but
we bought it back.


148
0:5:33,42 --> 0:5:35,8
We bought it back for pennies
on the dollar.


149
0:5:35,8 --> 0:5:36,85
And it wasn't worth anything.


150
0:5:36,85 --> 0:5:39,46
And then we moved to Brooklyn.


151
0:5:39,46 --> 0:5:41,28
And we just started
from scratch, like


152
0:5:41,28 --> 0:5:43,0
started from nothing.


153
0:5:43,0 --> 0:5:47,13
And so we only really became
Vice when we got back to being


154
0:5:47,13 --> 0:5:51,31
poor, and punk, and started
expanding in our own way, and


155
0:5:51,31 --> 0:5:53,98
having our own voice, and owning
our own company, and


156
0:5:53,98 --> 0:5:55,47
doing it our way.


157
0:5:55,47 --> 0:5:57,43
SPIKE JONZE: Describe the
different periods.


158
0:5:57,43 --> 0:5:59,9
And what the magazine
wrote about.


159
0:5:59,9 --> 0:6:3,23
And what the tone was in the
Montreal years, in the early


160
0:6:3,23 --> 0:6:3,84
Brooklyn years.


161
0:6:3,84 --> 0:6:7,18
SHANE SMITH: In the beginning
we were all about making up


162
0:6:7,18 --> 0:6:8,23
shocking stories.


163
0:6:8,23 --> 0:6:9,3
We made them up.


164
0:6:9,3 --> 0:6:11,33
So that was the beginning, was
sort of like "National


165
0:6:11,33 --> 0:6:15,37
Inquirer" type shocking stuff
combined with, like, hip-hop


166
0:6:15,37 --> 0:6:17,5
and punk rock.


167
0:6:17,5 --> 0:6:22,49
And then when we came down to
the states it was more of,


168
0:6:22,49 --> 0:6:24,61
like, we were drunk at our
Christmas party, and we were


169
0:6:24,61 --> 0:6:26,45
like, look at little
Eric Lavoie, who


170
0:6:26,45 --> 0:6:28,1
was my intern for--


171
0:6:28,1 --> 0:6:29,19
he's only had one job.


172
0:6:29,19 --> 0:6:31,52
He started working for
us when he was 17.


173
0:6:31,52 --> 0:6:33,84
And we were like, look
at that little guy.


174
0:6:33,84 --> 0:6:35,2
Let's do a whole issue on him.


175
0:6:35,2 --> 0:6:38,15
So like every article, every
fashion shoot, every record


176
0:6:38,15 --> 0:6:39,96
review was all him.


177
0:6:39,96 --> 0:6:41,61
And we just loved it.


178
0:6:41,61 --> 0:6:42,9
We thought that was
funny as hell.


179
0:6:42,9 --> 0:6:45,18
And half the people would say,
that's really funny.


180
0:6:45,18 --> 0:6:47,665
And half the people would say,
fuck you, "Vice," I hate you.


181
0:6:47,665 --> 0:6:49,48
You're full of shit.


182
0:6:49,48 --> 0:6:51,77
And we always said, actually,
from the beginning, either


183
0:6:51,77 --> 0:6:54,3
have people love you
or hate you.


184
0:6:54,3 --> 0:6:55,63
But just don't be in between.


185
0:6:55,63 --> 0:6:58,1
And it's the same thing with all
our good issues, like the


186
0:6:58,1 --> 0:7:0,85
Iraq issue, where we gave the
whole issue over to Iraqis


187
0:7:0,85 --> 0:7:1,9
during the war.


188
0:7:1,9 --> 0:7:3,2
Or the special issue.


189
0:7:3,2 --> 0:7:4,93
SPIKE JONZE: What's
the special issue?


190
0:7:4,93 --> 0:7:6,77
SHANE SMITH: We gave the
whole issue to a group


191
0:7:6,77 --> 0:7:8,64
called How's Your News?


192
0:7:8,64 --> 0:7:10,155
Which is a group
that does news.


193
0:7:10,155 --> 0:7:12,16
They're mentally challenged.


194
0:7:12,16 --> 0:7:13,23
I was really proud of that.


195
0:7:13,23 --> 0:7:15,38
And then when we went out into
the world more, we were like,


196
0:7:15,38 --> 0:7:18,73
oh, there's a lot of bad
things happening.


197
0:7:18,73 --> 0:7:22,34
We have a media platform, and
what are we talking about?


198
0:7:22,34 --> 0:7:24,6
A pair of Nikes that you
can only get in Tokyo


199
0:7:24,6 --> 0:7:25,96
between 2:00 and 6:00.


200
0:7:25,96 --> 0:7:28,26
So we got a little
more serious.


201
0:7:28,26 --> 0:7:31,11
It became more international,
for sure.


202
0:7:31,11 --> 0:7:32,78
Like, when we had two employees
and were in


203
0:7:32,78 --> 0:7:35,98
Montreal, it's different
than having 750


204
0:7:35,98 --> 0:7:37,665
employees in 40 countries.


205
0:7:37,665 --> 0:7:39,365
It's just a different entity.


206
0:7:39,365 --> 0:7:41,65
SPIKE JONZE: What were some of
the pieces that you guys did


207
0:7:41,65 --> 0:7:44,51
that were like turning,
defining points.


208
0:7:44,51 --> 0:7:47,14
SHANE SMITH: A lot of pieces
that made VBS famous were


209
0:7:47,14 --> 0:7:48,64
actually mag pieces.


210
0:7:48,64 --> 0:7:51,6
So like, Gun Markets in
Pakistan, Butt Naked in the


211
0:7:51,6 --> 0:7:55,35
Tupac Army, we shot Heavy
Metal in Baghdad.


212
0:7:55,35 --> 0:7:57,47
I think we do things
in a different way.


213
0:7:57,47 --> 0:7:59,8
We call it immersionism.


214
0:7:59,8 --> 0:8:0,29
So we come here, and
we just travel


215
0:8:0,29 --> 0:8:1,53
around, and we see shit.


216
0:8:1,53 --> 0:8:2,21
And we say, this
is what we saw.


217
0:8:2,21 --> 0:8:4,68
Maybe it's not 100%, obviously,
because you can't


218
0:8:4,68 --> 0:8:6,2
do it all in a couple
weeks or whatever.


219
0:8:6,2 --> 0:8:9,105
And I always used to say, like,
if you're looking at


220
0:8:9,105 --> 0:8:14,16
"Vice" for being news and the
truth, then you're in trouble.


221
0:8:14,16 --> 0:8:17,26
Because we didn't come up as,
like, I'm Jesus on my cross.


222
0:8:17,26 --> 0:8:21,16
We came up as, yeah, it's
totally cool, fucking shoes.


223
0:8:21,16 --> 0:8:22,99
Vice guide to fucking
eating pussy.


224
0:8:22,99 --> 0:8:26,3
Vice guide to fucking
you in the ass.


225
0:8:26,3 --> 0:8:29,5
I don't know if you've heard of
a thing called "Jackass."


226
0:8:29,5 --> 0:8:32,33
We were like that.


227
0:8:32,33 --> 0:8:34,419
We're not the best because
we're the best.


228
0:8:34,419 --> 0:8:36,25
We're the best because we're
the tallest of the midgets.


229
0:8:36,25 --> 0:8:39,39
But we want to get back
to being the best just


230
0:8:39,39 --> 0:8:40,9
for being the best.


231
0:8:40,9 --> 0:8:44,22
And that's why we're putting
Viceland, VBS, and "Vice"


232
0:8:44,22 --> 0:8:47,19
altogether as one beautiful
big boy.


233
0:8:47,19 --> 0:8:48,2
SPIKE JONZE: Online.


234
0:8:48,2 --> 0:8:49,87
SHANE SMITH: Online and in
the man, and everything.


235
0:8:49,87 --> 0:8:53,88
We're just going to-- because
we built "Vice" and then we


236
0:8:53,88 --> 0:8:55,99
built Viceland.


237
0:8:55,99 --> 0:8:57,79
And then we built VBS.


238
0:8:57,79 --> 0:9:0,0
And they all are a little bit
separate, but they all have


239
0:9:0,0 --> 0:9:2,67
the same voice, the same
attitude, the same people


240
0:9:2,67 --> 0:9:2,76
working on them.


241
0:9:2,76 --> 0:9:4,28
So we're like, why don't we just
put them all together.


242
0:9:4,28 --> 0:11:4,28
