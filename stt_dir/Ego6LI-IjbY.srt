1
0:0:22,909 --> 0:0:26,189
For most of my life, I've given little thought to the soil.


2
0:0:26,189 --> 0:0:29,639
To me it was the flat surface that I
walked on.


3
0:0:29,639 --> 0:0:33,21
I've been thinking a lot more about it
these days and what I learned has


4
0:0:33,21 --> 0:0:36,33
surprised me.


5
0:0:36,33 --> 0:0:39,39
I learned that soil is like the earth's skin


6
0:0:39,39 --> 0:0:40,539
that lies between the 


7
0:0:40,539 --> 0:0:42,85
sky and it's rock core.


8
0:0:42,85 --> 0:0:45,88
It's where plants keep tenuous grip with their
roots,


9
0:0:45,88 --> 0:0:49,76
as they harvest the sun's energy with their leaves.


10
0:0:49,76 --> 0:0:53,33
I begin to realize that soil is alive.


11
0:0:53,33 --> 0:0:57,48
That a handful of good soil contains
more living things than all the human


12
0:0:57,48 --> 0:1:0,8
beings that were ever born.


13
0:1:0,8 --> 0:1:2,67
It dawned on me that without soil


14
0:1:2,67 --> 0:1:6,64
life as we know it would not exist.


15
0:1:6,64 --> 0:1:8,27
If soil is alive


16
0:1:8,27 --> 0:1:11,4
I wondered if soil could die.


17
0:1:11,4 --> 0:1:15,14
I visited with Pam Thomas and spoke
to her about this.


18
0:1:15,14 --> 0:1:18,24
A recent historical example is the
Dust Bowl.


19
0:1:18,24 --> 0:1:21,66
In the early part of the 1900's 
homesteaders plowed


20
0:1:21,66 --> 0:1:26,38
millions of acres of prairie lands in order
to plant crops, mostly wheat, because


21
0:1:26,38 --> 0:1:28,979
wheat was bringing very high prices
during the 


22
0:1:28,979 --> 0:1:30,9
World War one wheat boom.


23
0:1:30,9 --> 0:1:34,9
Well because of this intensive
cultivation


24
0:1:34,9 --> 0:1:39,149
uh... the delicate balance - the ecosystem-
was essentially destroyed - you know you


25
0:1:39,149 --> 0:1:42,11
had the plants, the animals and the
micro-organisms


26
0:1:42,11 --> 0:1:46,18
to the point of where the soil no
longer was able to function.


27
0:1:46,18 --> 0:1:49,2
So as the wet years of the twenties
gave away to the


28
0:1:49,2 --> 0:1:50,14
drought of the


29
0:1:50,14 --> 0:1:51,52
thirties,


30
0:1:51,52 --> 0:1:52,539
the soil, which


31
0:1:52,539 --> 0:1:56,17
no longer had the natural anchors to
keep the soil in place, became very


32
0:1:56,17 --> 0:1:59,26
susceptible to wind erosion.


33
0:1:59,26 --> 0:2:1,58
In fact in the nineteen thirties


34
0:2:1,58 --> 0:2:6,159
dust storms would start the great plains and
would move cross-country to places like


35
0:2:6,159 --> 0:2:9,929
Boston and DC....


36
0:2:9,929 --> 0:2:12,719
Meanwhile in the southern US piedmont,


37
0:2:12,719 --> 0:2:15,7
plowing and monoculture crops destroyed
soil,


38
0:2:15,7 --> 0:2:18,259
causing massive gully erosion.


39
0:2:18,259 --> 0:2:22,429
Some of these gullies are still visible today.


40
0:2:22,429 --> 0:2:24,569
No wonder FDR said that


41
0:2:24,569 --> 0:2:29,19
"the nation that destroys its soil,
destroys itself."


42
0:2:29,19 --> 0:2:32,159
These were dramatic examples of soil
destruction,


43
0:2:32,159 --> 0:2:36,959
and I got to thinking how we were doing
today.


44
0:2:36,959 --> 0:2:41,319
We're still losing soil today. It's not as obvious
to us today as it was in the Dust


45
0:2:41,319 --> 0:2:42,46
Bowl thirties


46
0:2:42,46 --> 0:2:44,689
but it's an ongoing crisis because....


47
0:2:44,689 --> 0:2:48,579
the bottom line is, we are
feeding more and more people on fewer and


48
0:2:48,579 --> 0:2:50,109
fewer acres.


49
0:2:50,109 --> 0:2:55,219
We're literally losing ground.


50
0:2:55,219 --> 0:2:58,779
The nationalist Aldo Leopold warned us
that one of the dangers of


51
0:2:58,779 --> 0:3:0,419
living away from the land


52
0:3:0,419 --> 0:3:8,199
is that we are inclined to think
that our breakfast comes from the grocery store
...or a carton.


53
0:3:8,199 --> 0:3:10,949
This got me to wondering how much soil
we had to feed


54
0:3:10,949 --> 0:3:12,959
our planet.


55
0:3:12,959 --> 0:3:17,969
My soil scientist friend Jackie helped me
understand this. Imagine for a moment


56
0:3:17,969 --> 0:3:29,559
that the earth is this apple... seventy-five
percent of the earth is covered by water...


57
0:3:29,559 --> 0:3:33,729
Now half of the dry land on our planet is 
too hot or too cold


58
0:3:33,729 --> 0:3:39,469
to produce food for humans.


59
0:3:39,469 --> 0:3:44,319
Of this amount, about half is too
rocky, steep or too shallow to produce


60
0:3:44,319 --> 0:3:50,399
food.


61
0:3:50,399 --> 0:3:53,779
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to
figure that there's not much left


62
0:3:53,779 --> 0:3:56,539
over.


63
0:3:56,539 --> 0:3:59,679
And then what we have left is under
pressure from things like urban sprawl


64
0:3:59,679 --> 0:4:3,309
and erosion.


65
0:4:3,309 --> 0:4:4,39
It takes five


66
0:4:4,39 --> 0:4:7,49
hundred years to form an inch of soil, 


67
0:4:7,49 --> 0:4:9,699
something that can be destroyed in a few
minutes,


68
0:4:9,699 --> 0:4:14,43
and that worries me.


69
0:4:14,43 --> 0:4:18,609
Leonardo DaVinci said that we know more
about the movement of celestial bodies


70
0:4:18,609 --> 0:4:22,349
than about the soil underfoot...


71
0:4:22,349 --> 0:4:24,199
I'm guilty as charged


72
0:4:24,199 --> 0:4:29,12
but i'm not going to leave it that way.


73
0:4:29,12 --> 0:4:33,22
Join me in the rest of the series to find
out what soil really is and what it


74
0:4:33,22 --> 0:4:34,69
means to us...


75
0:4:34,69 --> 0:4:38,48
perhaps if we learned more about soil we'd
be better eqiupped to take care of the


76
0:4:38,48 --> 0:4:52,75
planet.


77
0:4:52,75 --> 0:4:55,449
If life is we know it depends on the
soil,


78
0:4:55,449 --> 0:4:59,81
it stands to reason that what happens
below the soil's surface has a profound


79
0:4:59,81 --> 0:5:3,84
influenced on what happens above the
surface.


80
0:5:3,84 --> 0:5:7,86
My knowledge of soils needed to run
deeper.


81
0:5:7,86 --> 0:5:11,84
The people that could help me do this
were the soil scientists - 


82
0:5:11,84 --> 0:5:16,7
their work is to look beneath the
surface into this life-giving, yet unseen


83
0:5:16,7 --> 0:5:17,599
world.


84
0:5:17,599 --> 0:5:21,299
Each day in the field is an adventure of
discovery for them -


85
0:5:21,299 --> 0:5:26,669
they have their own vocabulary and they
love the feel of dirt in their hands.


86
0:5:26,669 --> 0:5:30,669
this was the soils dream team,
and they would be my teachers for the


87
0:5:30,669 --> 0:5:32,939
next few weeks.


88
0:5:32,939 --> 0:5:38,419
Dennis is a veteran who has mapped over a
million acres of soils in his lifetime.


89
0:5:38,419 --> 0:5:42,789
Lance and Emory are also seasoned soil 
explorers who have discovered a new soil


90
0:5:42,789 --> 0:5:46,28
series that bears their respective
names.


91
0:5:46,28 --> 0:5:50,459
This was going to be fun.


92
0:5:50,459 --> 0:5:54,379
the first thing they showed me was how
the soil was formed.


93
0:5:54,379 --> 0:5:58,62
This happens when weather and living plants
and animals breakdown loose rock,


94
0:5:58,62 --> 0:6:0,77
called parent material.


95
0:6:0,77 --> 0:6:5,34
Parent material is typically weathered
bedrock that over time becomes the main


96
0:6:5,34 --> 0:6:7,639
mineral component of the soil.


97
0:6:7,639 --> 0:6:10,709
It looks like rock when you dig it out,
but as you can see


98
0:6:10,709 --> 0:6:12,74
it's very fragile


99
0:6:12,74 --> 0:6:18,199
massive structure, breaks easily.


100
0:6:18,199 --> 0:6:25,9
Dennis took me to a road cut to show me
that overtime, soil is formed in layers 
called horizons.


101
0:6:25,9 --> 0:6:27,729
These horizons tell us about
their history


102
0:6:27,729 --> 0:6:31,93
and they can also give us clues about
their future.


103
0:6:31,93 --> 0:6:35,58
This is the A Horizon or the 
surface layer.


104
0:6:35,58 --> 0:6:38,8
Look at all those roots in there.


105
0:6:38,8 --> 0:6:40,439
That's wonderful.


106
0:6:40,439 --> 0:6:44,209
Dark colors caused by the organic matter
in there.


107
0:6:44,209 --> 0:6:47,81
In here we have what's called the E 
Horizon, capital E.


108
0:6:47,81 --> 0:6:50,55
Fairly light in color,


109
0:6:50,55 --> 0:6:52,559
more sandy in texture


110
0:6:52,559 --> 0:6:54,409
and down below it,


111
0:6:54,409 --> 0:6:56,729
is our B Horizon


112
0:6:56,729 --> 0:7:1,169
that contains much more clay and 
you can see


113
0:7:1,169 --> 0:7:7,589
it's much more red down here, too.


114
0:7:7,589 --> 0:7:11,289
Each soil horizon has unique properties


115
0:7:11,289 --> 0:7:13,61
like depth, color or clay content.


116
0:7:13,61 --> 0:7:17,39
When these horizons are layered on top
of each other over time,


117
0:7:17,39 --> 0:7:18,0
they form soil


118
0:7:18,0 --> 0:7:21,61
profiles which can be identified by name.


119
0:7:21,61 --> 0:7:25,64
they are often named for the place they
were first identified, like Norfolk


120
0:7:25,64 --> 0:7:30,529
or Durham.


121
0:7:30,529 --> 0:7:34,919
When it comes to looking below the
soil's surface, nothing is as effective as a 


122
0:7:34,919 --> 0:7:37,75
good old-fashioned soil auger.


123
0:7:37,75 --> 0:7:40,55
You'll never find these guys in the
field without one-


124
0:7:40,55 --> 0:7:43,58
I guarantee it.


125
0:7:43,58 --> 0:7:47,86
Now I began to see how soil profiles
can tell their story,


126
0:7:47,86 --> 0:7:49,18
layer by layer.


127
0:7:49,18 --> 0:7:52,139
this is a soil profile


128
0:7:52,139 --> 0:7:55,11
put into a long tray so we can look at it
a little


129
0:7:55,11 --> 0:7:57,659
easier that pulling it out with the auger.


130
0:7:57,659 --> 0:8:0,33
In this hand here


131
0:8:0,33 --> 0:8:2,559
you'll see this is the A Horizon


132
0:8:2,559 --> 0:8:6,159
and you'll see it is much darker cause it
contains


133
0:8:6,159 --> 0:8:8,529
organic matter in here.


134
0:8:8,529 --> 0:8:14,6
This is the A Horizon or the surface layer.
This is eight or ten inches below the surface


135
0:8:14,6 --> 0:8:16,86
and see how red this is?


136
0:8:16,86 --> 0:8:18,969
All soils contain iron and we


137
0:8:18,969 --> 0:8:21,93
know if we put a piece of iron


138
0:8:21,93 --> 0:8:24,999
outside for two weeks it turns rusty.


139
0:8:24,999 --> 0:8:27,309
This is rusty soil.


140
0:8:27,309 --> 0:8:30,229
Rusty soil, how about that?


141
0:8:30,229 --> 0:8:33,3
So each color has a different meaning-


142
0:8:33,3 --> 0:8:36,66
bright reds  and yellows mean that
a soil is well-drained


143
0:8:36,66 --> 0:8:37,769
there's more oxygen


144
0:8:37,769 --> 0:8:42,29
in the soil to oxidize or rust the
iron in the soils.


145
0:8:42,29 --> 0:8:46,97
Grey colors on the other hand, mean the soil 
is waterlogged for most of the year


146
0:8:46,97 --> 0:8:50,47
because there is less oxygen to get at 
the iron.


147
0:8:50,47 --> 0:8:53,46
A dark brown color means more organic
matter


148
0:8:53,46 --> 0:8:57,4
which is mostly in the A Horizon or topsoil.


149
0:8:57,4 --> 0:9:3,7
we can use the Munsell Color book to classify
the exact color of the soil. 


150
0:9:3,7 --> 0:9:4,13
We take the  


151
0:9:4,13 --> 0:9:5,61
soil ped


152
0:9:5,61 --> 0:9:7,86
and put it behind the book


153
0:9:7,86 --> 0:9:13,5
and find the colorship that it most
resembles.


154
0:9:13,5 --> 0:9:16,57
I'm going to say that it's that
color there


155
0:9:16,57 --> 0:9:20,56
2.5 YR 4 8 


156
0:9:20,56 --> 0:9:23,73
2.5 YR 4 8 by the
way


157
0:9:23,73 --> 0:9:27,85
is a more precise way of saying "red".


158
0:9:27,85 --> 0:9:31,78
Dennis also pointed out to me that
soil depth is another way


159
0:9:31,78 --> 0:9:33,59
to identify soils.


160
0:9:33,59 --> 0:9:36,64
This is the "Cecil series"
because the clay content


161
0:9:36,64 --> 0:9:39,5
extends below a thirty inch depth.


162
0:9:39,5 --> 0:9:43,3
If this clay content decreased above a
a thirty inch depth


163
0:9:43,3 --> 0:9:45,56
it's called the "Pacolet series".


164
0:9:45,56 --> 0:9:49,27
They're kissing cousins.


165
0:9:49,27 --> 0:9:51,7
Whoa! kissing cousins?


166
0:9:51,7 --> 0:9:56,9
It turns out that if two soils have 
similar color and clay content,


167
0:9:56,9 --> 0:9:57,45
but different depths,


168
0:9:57,45 --> 0:10:0,7
they'd be named differently.


169
0:10:0,7 --> 0:10:6,29
At this point I knew enough to see how
you could identify a specific soil series.


170
0:10:6,29 --> 0:10:11,19
I was now ready for Lance and Emory
to show me their newly discovered soil -


171
0:10:11,19 --> 0:10:14,54
it's named the Brewback series.


172
0:10:14,54 --> 0:10:16,39
Right there, about 22 inches


173
0:10:16,39 --> 0:10:19,5
we just starting to barely nip on the
CR material.  


174
0:10:19,5 --> 0:10:25,44
You can hear the grind and feel 
it in the auger.


175
0:10:25,44 --> 0:10:27,32
Right here we have the A Horizon.


176
0:10:27,32 --> 0:10:31,49
It's about six inches thick and it's a fine,
sandy loam.


177
0:10:31,49 --> 0:10:36,35
Then we get into the B Horizon, which is 
a heavy clay.


178
0:10:36,35 --> 0:10:37,27
And here, about


179
0:10:37,27 --> 0:10:40,6
twelve or fifteen inches, 
we have the uh... 


180
0:10:40,6 --> 0:10:41,91
the grey colors


181
0:10:41,91 --> 0:10:48,62
coming in, and for a Brewback soil we 
have to have the grey colors within 


182
0:10:48,62 --> 0:10:51,8
the top ten inches of the B Horzion.


183
0:10:51,8 --> 0:10:55,51
As we move on down the profile about
twenty inches, we get the sandy, clay loam,


184
0:10:55,51 --> 0:11:3,27
which is the B-C horizon, which is a transition 
between the B Horizon and the parent material.


185
0:11:3,27 --> 0:11:6,48
By this time, I had seen a few soil series,


186
0:11:6,48 --> 0:11:10,17
each with its on color, depth, and
clay content -


187
0:11:10,17 --> 0:11:15,8
each with its own personality if you will.
It turns out that soil scientists have


188
0:11:15,8 --> 0:11:20,26
identified and mapped over nineteen
thousand different soil series in the


189
0:11:20,26 --> 0:11:21,46
country.


190
0:11:21,46 --> 0:11:23,83
That sounds like a huge effort -


191
0:11:23,83 --> 0:11:26,319
I had to find out who was doing the work


192
0:11:26,319 --> 0:11:37,16
and why it is so important.


193
0:11:37,16 --> 0:11:41,25
I found out that the massive effort of
identifying and mapping soils 


194
0:11:41,25 --> 0:11:43,3
is known as the soil survey.


195
0:11:43,3 --> 0:11:47,51
The body of information resulting from
this ongoing effort, also known as 


196
0:11:47,51 --> 0:11:48,72
the soil survey,


197
0:11:48,72 --> 0:11:55,23
is available in hard copy and online
at the web soil survey.


198
0:11:55,23 --> 0:11:59,68
It's an inventory of soil maps, soil
properties, suitabilities and


199
0:11:59,68 --> 0:12:1,34
limitations.


200
0:12:1,34 --> 0:12:5,0
I was reminded that what happens beneath
the surface of the soil ultimately


201
0:12:5,0 --> 0:12:7,74
affects everything above its surface.


202
0:12:7,74 --> 0:12:9,3
Everything.


203
0:12:9,3 --> 0:12:11,3
That's what makes the soil surveys


204
0:12:11,3 --> 0:12:15,29
so important to any land management
decision, from farming to disaster


205
0:12:15,29 --> 0:12:18,41
recovery planning.


206
0:12:18,41 --> 0:12:20,689
I drove out to Lee County to find
out


207
0:12:20,689 --> 0:12:23,1
who the people were behind all this work,


208
0:12:23,1 --> 0:12:26,82
and how soils were mapped.


209
0:12:26,82 --> 0:12:30,64
Charlie is a soil scientist who is
responsible for the upkeep of about


210
0:12:30,64 --> 0:12:34,57
eleven million acres of soil survey.


211
0:12:34,57 --> 0:12:35,8
Most of this...all of


212
0:12:35,8 --> 0:12:38,91
South Carolina has been mapped,


213
0:12:38,91 --> 0:12:40,85
so what we're doing is updating all


214
0:12:40,85 --> 0:12:45,21
the older soil surveys.


215
0:12:45,21 --> 0:12:48,5
He offered to take us through the
process of making a soils map in the


216
0:12:48,5 --> 0:12:49,46
field,


217
0:12:49,46 --> 0:12:53,6
and I asked him to sketch out the day
for us.


218
0:12:53,6 --> 0:12:56,48
One of the things we do,


219
0:12:56,48 --> 0:13:3,48
when we go through the process of 
making the soil map


220
0:13:3,48 --> 0:13:4,42
is to stand and just look at the area


221
0:13:4,42 --> 0:13:6,18
and take in the whole landscape itself.
and you can see out in this part of the world,


222
0:13:6,18 --> 0:13:11,29
that some areas of it are 
concave, some of it are more convex.


223
0:13:11,29 --> 0:13:12,589
So essentially what we do


224
0:13:12,589 --> 0:13:15,82
is to stand out here and note where these
areas are,


225
0:13:15,82 --> 0:13:17,26
dig the holes,


226
0:13:17,26 --> 0:13:19,4
identify the soils,


227
0:13:19,4 --> 0:13:22,86
and label them on the map
using alpha-numeric symbols.


228
0:13:22,86 --> 0:13:24,9
The finished product looks
like this.


229
0:13:24,9 --> 0:13:28,29
This is the same area that
we're standing in, and


230
0:13:28,29 --> 0:13:36,8
we can see that these soil lines
delineate the different tones on the map. 


231
0:13:36,8 --> 0:13:40,5
The first hole we dug was on a 
slight rise...


232
0:13:40,5 --> 0:13:44,57
we then moved over to a slightly lower area
only three hundred feet away and dug
another hole.


233
0:13:44,57 --> 0:13:46,63
Charlie showed me the


234
0:13:46,63 --> 0:13:50,38
difference between the two soils that 
was so close to one


235
0:13:50,38 --> 0:13:51,22
another, and how


236
0:13:51,22 --> 0:13:55,53
land form influenced them.


237
0:13:55,53 --> 0:13:57,14
This soil in the front,


238
0:13:57,14 --> 0:13:58,689
is the "Rains Series".


239
0:13:58,689 --> 0:14:2,51
This soil in the back is the
"Nolfork Series" that we looked at earlier.


240
0:14:2,51 --> 0:14:9,22
One of the first things we notice is that 
the surface of the "Rains" is darker


241
0:14:9,22 --> 0:14:12,4
and that is reflected by the tones on 
the map.


242
0:14:12,4 --> 0:14:14,59
The other obvious thing is that the subsoil
is much grayer. 


243
0:14:14,59 --> 0:14:18,7
Where the "Norfolk" series is dominately brown, 
the "Rains" is dominantly gray. 


244
0:14:18,7 --> 0:14:18,97
The grayer


245
0:14:18,97 --> 0:14:24,129
colors immediately below the surface
means that this soil formed and still at times


246
0:14:24,129 --> 0:14:26,3
will have a water table


247
0:14:26,3 --> 0:14:30,129
at or near the soils surface.


248
0:14:30,129 --> 0:14:31,44
And although these soils are only 300
feet apart, the 


249
0:14:31,44 --> 0:14:41,12
water table is a limiting factor on
land management here in the Coastal Plains.


250
0:14:41,12 --> 0:14:44,9
Part of the process of making a map


251
0:14:44,9 --> 0:14:46,37
is to ask the questions


252
0:14:46,37 --> 0:14:48,93
and then to go get the answers.


253
0:14:48,93 --> 0:14:51,21
And once we've identifed some
soils in the area,


254
0:14:51,21 --> 0:14:55,23
we begin to understand


255
0:14:55,23 --> 0:14:56,9
that the same soils 


256
0:14:56,9 --> 0:14:59,88
more than likely will be occurring in that
area.


257
0:14:59,88 --> 0:15:3,67
It looked like Charlie asked and 
answered a lot of questions -


258
0:15:3,67 --> 0:15:10,54
I don't know how many miles he walked,
but he mapped 300 acres that day.


259
0:15:10,54 --> 0:15:12,79
Many of my conservationist friends


260
0:15:12,79 --> 0:15:19,7
tell me that a bad day in the field is
better than a good day in the office.


261
0:15:19,7 --> 0:15:23,56
I began to reflect on my new-found
appreciation for the work that Charlie and


262
0:15:23,56 --> 0:15:26,67
his colleagues do in the soil survey.


263
0:15:26,67 --> 0:15:29,74
My knowledge of the big picture was
taking shape,


264
0:15:29,74 --> 0:15:38,71
but I wanted to see the area we had mapped
in the Web Soil Survey for myself.


265
0:15:38,71 --> 0:15:42,88
Back at the office, I went to the Web
Soil survey and found the place we had


266
0:15:42,88 --> 0:15:49,72
mapped in Lee county.  I drew my area of 
interest boundary and went to the soils 
map tab.


267
0:15:49,72 --> 0:15:53,159
All the familiar soils - Goldsboro,
Noboco,


268
0:15:53,159 --> 0:15:55,55
Norfolk and Rains appeared.


269
0:15:55,55 --> 0:15:59,59
I was in the right place.


270
0:15:59,59 --> 0:16:4,36
Charlie had told me that depth to the
water table was the limiting factor here,


271
0:16:4,36 --> 0:16:9,89
so I went to the soils data explorer
to look at the soils properties.


272
0:16:9,89 --> 0:16:16,56
Sure enough, the Goldsboro and Rains soil
had shallow water tables as we had seen 
in the field.


273
0:16:16,56 --> 0:16:21,4
I then had a look at the soils suitabilities
and limitations for land use


274
0:16:21,4 --> 0:16:23,86
to see where the best place to, say,


275
0:16:23,86 --> 0:16:26,1
build a house would be.


276
0:16:26,1 --> 0:16:28,47
It turns out that if I were to do that,


277
0:16:28,47 --> 0:16:32,75
it is better on a Norfolk soil and
maybe on a Goldsboro - 


278
0:16:32,75 --> 0:16:36,64
all of the other soils were going to be
too wet.


279
0:16:36,64 --> 0:16:39,89
I used the shopping cart feature,
which was free by the way,


280
0:16:39,89 --> 0:16:42,75
to get a custom soil survey report....


281
0:16:42,75 --> 0:16:49,76
a little memento of my day in Lee county.


282
0:16:49,76 --> 0:16:51,46
What I had learned so far 


283
0:16:51,46 --> 0:16:55,17
showed me the broad brush strokes of
soils in the landscape


284
0:16:55,17 --> 0:17:0,48
and how they affect so many of our above-
ground land management decisions.


285
0:17:0,48 --> 0:17:14,569
I now wanted to see the soil from a
different perspective.


286
0:17:14,569 --> 0:17:17,65
To get really upclose and personal
with soils, 


287
0:17:17,65 --> 0:17:22,25
I visited with my good friend Richard
in his garden.


288
0:17:22,25 --> 0:17:25,25
We moved into our house about 1984,


289
0:17:25,25 --> 0:17:30,6
and we have always had the hopes of having a garden.
We've tried a whole different


290
0:17:30,6 --> 0:17:33,6
groups that things, We've always had
tomatoes and squash, diffferent


291
0:17:33,6 --> 0:17:35,72
kinds of squash, zuchinni, yellow squash,


292
0:17:35,72 --> 0:17:37,25
and uh...


293
0:17:37,25 --> 0:17:41,0
melons, cucumbers. That's been the basis.


294
0:17:41,0 --> 0:17:45,6
Now we've gone from about half an inch of topsoil,
to about eight and half, nine inches.


295
0:17:45,6 --> 0:17:46,4
So


296
0:17:46,4 --> 0:17:48,57
it'll be good for the next people 
who will be moving in.


297
0:17:48,57 --> 0:17:52,22
uh... they'll be able to use the soil well,


298
0:17:52,22 --> 0:17:54,85
..and now we're trying to do a no-till


299
0:17:54,85 --> 0:17:59,22
garden. So that's a new step in our direction.


300
0:17:59,22 --> 0:18:2,0
To take a close look at Richard's soil,


301
0:18:2,0 --> 0:18:5,25
we took a sample and put it under a microscope.


302
0:18:5,25 --> 0:18:9,12
The first thing we noticed was that the
soil was made up of both 


303
0:18:9,12 --> 0:18:12,11
mineral and organic particles.


304
0:18:12,11 --> 0:18:16,48
The next thing we noticed was how much
mineral particles size varied.


305
0:18:16,48 --> 0:18:17,42
It turns out


306
0:18:17,42 --> 0:18:20,73
that mineral particles can be classified
by size,


307
0:18:20,73 --> 0:18:25,11
sands being the largest and clays the
smallest.


308
0:18:25,11 --> 0:18:29,72
Sand is gritty to the touch, while
clay has a sticky feel to it.


309
0:18:29,72 --> 0:18:32,73
Pure silt, not very common in the
southeast,


310
0:18:32,73 --> 0:18:37,279
feels like talcum powder between the fingers.


311
0:18:37,279 --> 0:18:42,1
The mix of these sand, silt and clay
particles in a soil is known as


312
0:18:42,1 --> 0:18:43,54
soil texture.


313
0:18:43,54 --> 0:18:45,69
Clayey soils are fertile


314
0:18:45,69 --> 0:18:48,22
but they don't always drain well.


315
0:18:48,22 --> 0:18:49,97
Sandy soils on the other hand


316
0:18:49,97 --> 0:18:53,86
drained very well but are generally not
fertile.


317
0:18:53,86 --> 0:18:57,84
The soil in Richard's garden contains
about 40% sand,


318
0:18:57,84 --> 0:18:59,379
40% silt


319
0:18:59,379 --> 0:19:2,3
and only 20% clay.


320
0:19:2,3 --> 0:19:3,97
This would make it a loam - 


321
0:19:3,97 --> 0:19:11,42
the soil texture that combines both
good drainage and fertility.


322
0:19:11,42 --> 0:19:14,6
If you hold Richard's soil in your
hand,


323
0:19:14,6 --> 0:19:18,24
you can see that it clumps together nicely
into soil aggregates.


324
0:19:18,24 --> 0:19:24,9
Soil scientists call this aggregation
property soil structure -


325
0:19:24,9 --> 0:19:28,83
keep in mind that structure is a
different soil property to texture.


326
0:19:28,83 --> 0:19:31,48
Soil aggregates, or soil peds, can


327
0:19:31,48 --> 0:19:33,44
be classified by size,


328
0:19:33,44 --> 0:19:35,86
shape and strength.


329
0:19:35,86 --> 0:19:40,31
Good soil structure is important in soils
because water, air,


330
0:19:40,31 --> 0:19:48,19
nutrients and roots will find it easier to
move between soil aggregates than
through them.


331
0:19:48,19 --> 0:19:51,12
One of the surprising discoveries I
recently made


332
0:19:51,12 --> 0:19:57,18
was that in an undisturbed soil, about
half of the soil's volume is
made up of spaces.


333
0:19:57,18 --> 0:20:0,49
These spaces are vital to the health of
the soil


334
0:20:0,49 --> 0:20:3,32
because they contain air or water-


335
0:20:3,32 --> 0:20:8,41
it's in these spaces where soil
chemistry and biology are at work.


336
0:20:8,41 --> 0:20:10,46
Soil scientists tell me


337
0:20:10,46 --> 0:20:12,82
that these are called pore spaces.


338
0:20:12,82 --> 0:20:18,11
If they are between sand, silt and clay
particles, we call them micropores.


339
0:20:18,11 --> 0:20:23,32
The much larger spaces we found between
soil aggregates are called macropores.


340
0:20:23,32 --> 0:20:25,96
Macropores are especially important


341
0:20:25,96 --> 0:20:29,12
because they become the superhighways
for air,


342
0:20:29,12 --> 0:20:32,799
water and nutrients to reach plant
roots.


343
0:20:32,799 --> 0:20:36,45
Richard put his rototiller away
a few years ago.


344
0:20:36,45 --> 0:20:38,1
Less disturbance by rototilling


345
0:20:38,1 --> 0:20:43,3
has benefited his soil by preserving
those pore spaces.


346
0:20:43,3 --> 0:20:45,429
More spaces for air, water


347
0:20:45,429 --> 0:20:47,38
and roots in the soil


348
0:20:47,38 --> 0:20:55,14
means more vegetables on the table for
Richard and his family.


349
0:20:55,14 --> 0:20:59,7
I had always thought of pH as a 
property of water and not soil.


350
0:20:59,7 --> 0:21:3,649
Lemon juice has a pH of about three -
that's acidic,


351
0:21:3,649 --> 0:21:6,42
and baking soda has a pH of about nine -


352
0:21:6,42 --> 0:21:8,16
that's basic.


353
0:21:8,16 --> 0:21:10,13
Pure water, which is neutral, 


354
0:21:10,13 --> 0:21:12,75
has a pH of seven.


355
0:21:12,75 --> 0:21:17,14
Now that I realized that more than a
quarter of the volume of soil is water,


356
0:21:17,14 --> 0:21:18,73
this make sense.


357
0:21:18,73 --> 0:21:21,26
The water chemistry in those pore
spaces is


358
0:21:21,26 --> 0:21:26,54
critical to how plants absorb nutrients
from the soil.


359
0:21:26,54 --> 0:21:30,299
Richard usually gets his soil tested at the
local extension,


360
0:21:30,299 --> 0:21:32,61
but pH test kits like this


361
0:21:32,61 --> 0:21:35,84
are available online or at local stores.


362
0:21:35,84 --> 0:21:38,2
...between six and seven...


363
0:21:38,2 --> 0:21:41,87
His soil is slightly acidic but, it's in
the range from most of his plants


364
0:21:41,87 --> 0:21:43,63
thrive.


365
0:21:43,63 --> 0:21:47,7
If the pH is too low his plants will not
be able to take up


366
0:21:47,7 --> 0:21:50,52
nutrients like nitrogen and potassium.


367
0:21:50,52 --> 0:21:52,46
If the pH gets too high


368
0:21:52,46 --> 0:21:55,5
his plants would have problems absorbing
iron,


369
0:21:55,5 --> 0:21:57,2
manganese and zinc.


370
0:21:57,2 --> 0:22:3,83
So keeping that pH in the 6-7 range 
is really critical.


371
0:22:3,83 --> 0:22:5,61
As we finished up our visit,


372
0:22:5,61 --> 0:22:9,15
Richard shared some of his land
philosophy with me.


373
0:22:9,15 --> 0:22:14,16
I believe in stewardship. If..if you're given
something can you make it..improve it or


374
0:22:14,16 --> 0:22:16,11
can it be better for the next person?


375
0:22:16,11 --> 0:22:18,7
So we've done everything we can to


376
0:22:18,7 --> 0:22:24,1
help it be someplace that people 
will enjoy later.


377
0:22:24,1 --> 0:22:26,44
That got me to thinking.


378
0:22:26,44 --> 0:22:28,409
Richard's soil is a Cecil -


379
0:22:28,409 --> 0:22:30,0
that won't change.


380
0:22:30,0 --> 0:22:33,83
But it was clear that there were some
properties in the top six to nine inches


381
0:22:33,83 --> 0:22:38,309
of Cecil soil that he had improved
through good management.


382
0:22:38,309 --> 0:22:43,51
It means that a Cecil soil could be
healthy or unhealthy, depending on how


383
0:22:43,51 --> 0:22:45,74
it's managed.


384
0:22:45,74 --> 0:22:48,58
A healthy or unhealthy soil?


385
0:22:48,58 --> 0:23:7,64
This was a fascinating concept that I had
to explore further.


386
0:23:7,64 --> 0:23:11,82
I spoke to Pam and told her about my
experience and asked her if management made


387
0:23:11,82 --> 0:23:14,0
a difference to the soils.


388
0:23:14,0 --> 0:23:17,88
She replied with a story from the
famous soil scientist and father of


389
0:23:17,88 --> 0:23:24,64
soil conservation Hugh Hammond Bennett.


390
0:23:24,64 --> 0:23:29,35
In the early part of his career, in the 1900s,
he and a colleague were wandering around,


391
0:23:29,35 --> 0:23:32,36
when they noticed two pieces of land
side by side.


392
0:23:32,36 --> 0:23:37,19
These two pieces of land looked vastly
different, in terms of soil quality.


393
0:23:37,19 --> 0:23:40,69
It was obvious that these two areas, at
one time, had been identical. They had the


394
0:23:40,69 --> 0:23:44,2
same geology, the same slope,
and the same climate.


395
0:23:44,2 --> 0:23:47,37
However, in one area the soil was soft.


396
0:23:47,37 --> 0:23:50,96
It was loamy and moist enough that
they could dig it with their hands,
even in 


397
0:23:50,96 --> 0:23:52,399
dry weather.


398
0:23:52,399 --> 0:23:53,6
The other area,


399
0:23:53,6 --> 0:23:56,36
in contrast, was very hard and dry.


400
0:23:56,36 --> 0:24:0,63
It was almost like a brick. They could not
dig it at all.


401
0:24:0,63 --> 0:24:4,61
The difference between these two was that 
the soft one, the mellow one, was under


402
0:24:4,61 --> 0:24:6,17
a dense forest,


403
0:24:6,17 --> 0:24:10,7
while the other one had been
continuously cultivated for decades.


404
0:24:10,7 --> 0:24:14,929
Mr. Bennett, or Big Hugh, called this
his epiphany.


405
0:24:14,929 --> 0:24:20,2
Big Hugh's epiphany was about how management
can change soil function.


406
0:24:20,2 --> 0:24:21,899
Put in the simplest terms,


407
0:24:21,899 --> 0:24:26,6
soil function is its ability to moderate
water flow and storage,


408
0:24:26,6 --> 0:24:28,1
to store and recycle nutrients


409
0:24:28,1 --> 0:24:31,96
and to sustain life.


410
0:24:31,96 --> 0:24:36,25
In the spirit of Big Hugh's epiphany, I
did a simple test to see how well


411
0:24:36,25 --> 0:24:39,16
soil structure holds together in water,


412
0:24:39,16 --> 0:24:41,71
it's called teh slake test.


413
0:24:41,71 --> 0:24:43,529
I took two soils - 


414
0:24:43,529 --> 0:24:46,49
both from the same soils series,


415
0:24:46,49 --> 0:24:48,94
one was continuously cultivated


416
0:24:48,94 --> 0:24:53,19
and the other had been under no-till
and cover crops for years.


417
0:24:53,19 --> 0:24:54,6
The no-till soil measured out


418
0:24:54,6 --> 0:24:58,71
at 3% of carbon-rich soil organic matter,


419
0:24:58,71 --> 0:25:1,11
the paler, tilled soil at less than


420
0:25:1,11 --> 0:25:5,74
half a percent.


421
0:25:5,74 --> 0:25:9,22
It didn't take me long to figure which soil
was healthy.


422
0:25:9,22 --> 0:25:16,83
It's no wonder so many of our Piedmont
reservoirs are the color they are.


423
0:25:16,83 --> 0:25:20,42
The difference in the way the two soils
behaved is about glue


424
0:25:20,42 --> 0:25:24,4
and string. Soil-life... roots,


425
0:25:24,4 --> 0:25:27,13
earthworms, fungi and bacteria,


426
0:25:27,13 --> 0:25:32,97
secrete biotic glues. Roots and fungi
also form biotic string,


427
0:25:32,97 --> 0:25:36,58
which works with the glues to form a
sticky network that holds soil


428
0:25:36,58 --> 0:25:38,82
particles together.


429
0:25:38,82 --> 0:25:43,52
The glue and string is what keeps the
pore spaces between the particles open,


430
0:25:43,52 --> 0:25:48,57
to provide a place for water storage
and flow, and to provide a habitat for all of


431
0:25:48,57 --> 0:25:52,25
the soil organisms.


432
0:25:52,25 --> 0:25:55,91
This allows water be stored and
to move through the soil when it's


433
0:25:55,91 --> 0:25:59,72
needed.


434
0:25:59,72 --> 0:26:3,58
The easiest way of damaging the
glue and string is by disturbing


435
0:26:3,58 --> 0:26:6,53
the soil.


436
0:26:6,53 --> 0:26:8,61
Soil disturbance chops up the 


437
0:26:8,61 --> 0:26:9,82
biotic string


438
0:26:9,82 --> 0:26:14,28
and allows piranha-like bacteria to gobble
up the carbon-rich


439
0:26:14,28 --> 0:26:15,54
string and the glues,


440
0:26:15,54 --> 0:26:21,93
turning them into carbon dioxide and
releasing them into the atmosphere.


441
0:26:21,93 --> 0:26:26,91
When i removed the soil organic matter
the pore spaces collapsed and I was left


442
0:26:26,91 --> 0:26:29,68
with empty dirt.


443
0:26:29,68 --> 0:26:34,39
Any kind of soil disturbance will do 
this, the more intense, the more of the soil


444
0:26:34,39 --> 0:26:37,77
will be damaged.


445
0:26:37,77 --> 0:26:40,75
If Big Hugh were still around he'd
have a


446
0:26:40,75 --> 0:26:45,29
fascinating conversation with today's
soil ecologists.


447
0:26:45,29 --> 0:26:50,4
They'd tell him that the glue and string
are part of soil organic matter, which


448
0:26:50,4 --> 0:26:55,9
consists of decomposable organic
material, humus and living things.


449
0:26:55,9 --> 0:27:1,45
The decomposable organic material is like
the pantry for many soil organisms.


450
0:27:1,45 --> 0:27:7,0
Humus, dark and sponge-like, is a very
stable organic substance that remains


451
0:27:7,0 --> 0:27:10,74
after many soil organisms have used
and transformed


452
0:27:10,74 --> 0:27:14,0
the original decomposable material.


453
0:27:14,0 --> 0:27:15,419
One of the functions of humus


454
0:27:15,419 --> 0:27:20,649
is to be a sponge that holds water
for drier weather.


455
0:27:20,649 --> 0:27:26,47
About 5% of the soil organic
matter's mass is made up of living things,


456
0:27:26,47 --> 0:27:29,999
microscopic soil bugs or soil microbes,


457
0:27:29,999 --> 0:27:33,83
and animals that we can see without a
microscope.


458
0:27:33,83 --> 0:27:38,679
The weight of the microbes alone under
one acre of this soil's surface


459
0:27:38,679 --> 0:27:42,1
is more than this cow-calf pair.


460
0:27:42,1 --> 0:27:47,23
That's a lot of microbes.


461
0:27:47,23 --> 0:27:51,1
It's the soil biology that
regulates about 90% of the


462
0:27:51,1 --> 0:27:52,429
soil's function


463
0:27:52,429 --> 0:27:57,279
of moderating the flow and storage of
water, nutrients and energy


464
0:27:57,279 --> 0:27:58,74
....in your backyard,


465
0:27:58,74 --> 0:28:0,33
in the farm field,


466
0:28:0,33 --> 0:28:6,279
on our planet.


467
0:28:6,279 --> 0:28:9,6
I still worry about urban sprawl and erosion,


468
0:28:9,6 --> 0:28:14,13
and the amount of fuel and 
fertilizer we use to make food.


469
0:28:14,13 --> 0:28:15,97
But there's good news.


470
0:28:15,97 --> 0:28:19,26
Soils are resilient and forgiving!


471
0:28:19,26 --> 0:28:21,48
From the Carolinas to the Dakotas,


472
0:28:21,48 --> 0:28:24,41
farmers and gardeners are restoring
soil health


473
0:28:24,41 --> 0:28:27,52
by working with nature, not against it...


474
0:28:27,52 --> 0:28:28,95
they've stopped tilling.


475
0:28:28,95 --> 0:28:30,49
Completely.


476
0:28:30,49 --> 0:28:33,6
They've started growing multi-species
cover crops


477
0:28:33,6 --> 0:28:35,96
that feed and cover the soil...


478
0:28:35,96 --> 0:28:37,5
it's growing them more


479
0:28:37,5 --> 0:28:41,649
and costing them far less.


480
0:28:41,649 --> 0:28:45,2
In the cities, they're planting trees 
and rain gardens,


481
0:28:45,2 --> 0:28:49,15
restoring old buildings instead of
breaking new ground.


482
0:28:49,15 --> 0:28:52,1
School kids are learning more about
soils....


483
0:28:52,1 --> 0:28:54,58
that's huge.


484
0:28:54,58 --> 0:28:58,31
In these last few months, I have come such
a long way,and yet


485
0:28:58,31 --> 0:29:2,28
where i stand now, I see how much more
I have to learn.


486
0:29:2,28 --> 0:29:6,44
Sometimes I feel all of this can be
overwhelming, but when i think of


487
0:29:6,44 --> 0:29:8,74
Big Hugh and what he went through,


488
0:29:8,74 --> 0:29:11,289
I think he'd tell me that there's
hope.


489
0:29:11,289 --> 0:31:11,289
I bet he'd like us to call it "humic hope".
