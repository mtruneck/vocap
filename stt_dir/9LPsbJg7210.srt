1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:9,28



2
0:0:9,28 --> 0:0:10,895
MALE SPEAKER 1: What?


3
0:0:10,895 --> 0:0:12,5
Gnarly trick.


4
0:0:12,5 --> 0:0:14,87
JIM GRECO: Me and him were at
the diner one day, and we


5
0:0:14,87 --> 0:0:18,38
chased down and attacked some
guy that started some shit


6
0:0:18,38 --> 0:0:19,75
with us in front of the diner.


7
0:0:19,75 --> 0:0:21,8
MALE SPEAKER 2: Put the
fucking board up.


8
0:0:21,8 --> 0:0:22,14
JIM GRECO: Whoa, back
the fuck off.


9
0:0:22,14 --> 0:0:22,85
MALE SPEAKER 2: Put the
fucking board up.


10
0:0:22,85 --> 0:0:23,85
JIM GRECO: Walk away.


11
0:0:23,85 --> 0:0:24,53
Walk away.


12
0:0:24,53 --> 0:0:25,3
Go!


13
0:0:25,3 --> 0:0:25,53
Now!


14
0:0:25,53 --> 0:0:26,3
See ya.


15
0:0:26,3 --> 0:0:26,53
MALE SPEAKER 2: Fucking queer.


16
0:0:26,53 --> 0:0:27,3
JIM GRECO: Bye-bye.


17
0:0:27,3 --> 0:0:28,6
And I was like, come
on, you can help me


18
0:0:28,6 --> 0:0:29,18
chase this guy down.


19
0:0:29,18 --> 0:0:31,98
And I went and smashed his
truck up with my board.


20
0:0:31,98 --> 0:0:35,26
And I got him thrown right
in the middle of it.


21
0:0:35,26 --> 0:0:37,3
That was my introduction
to him, but--


22
0:0:37,3 --> 0:0:38,521
MALE SPEAKER 3: He helped
you beat this guy up?


23
0:0:38,521 --> 0:0:39,99
JIM GRECO: We didn't
beat the guy up.


24
0:0:39,99 --> 0:0:43,22
We just kind of chased him
down and scared him.


25
0:0:43,22 --> 0:0:48,76
But yeah, Lizard's sick, man.


26
0:0:48,76 --> 0:0:49,4
MALE SPEAKER 3: What's up?


27
0:0:49,4 --> 0:0:51,71
Welcome back to "Epicly
Later'd." This episode is


28
0:0:51,71 --> 0:0:53,95
about Lizard King, who's
a friend of mine.


29
0:0:53,95 --> 0:0:57,11
He is a quite ridiculous
person.


30
0:0:57,11 --> 0:0:58,8
He kind of is, like, friends
with everybody.


31
0:0:58,8 --> 0:1:0,48
You'll see in this episode.


32
0:1:0,48 --> 0:1:3,42
Not only is he an awesome street
skater that will just


33
0:1:3,42 --> 0:1:6,71
do anything or jump off of
anything, he'll just do the


34
0:1:6,71 --> 0:1:9,4
mega ramp, which not
many streets


35
0:1:9,4 --> 0:1:10,65
skaters have done that.


36
0:1:10,65 --> 0:1:13,7
So we're going to go over his
house, meet up with him, see


37
0:1:13,7 --> 0:1:16,81
what he gets into on
an average weekday.


38
0:1:16,81 --> 0:1:17,71
So this is it.


39
0:1:17,71 --> 0:1:20,25
The Lizard King episode.


40
0:1:20,25 --> 0:1:21,68
LIZARD KING: You guys should
teach your dogs how to use


41
0:1:21,68 --> 0:1:23,86
toilets like normal people.


42
0:1:23,86 --> 0:1:25,36
MALE SPEAKER 3: You're from
Utah, originally?


43
0:1:25,36 --> 0:1:28,35
LIZARD KING: Mm-hm, Salt
Lake City, fool.


44
0:1:28,35 --> 0:1:29,83
Salt Lake's tight.


45
0:1:29,83 --> 0:1:32,66
Buttery ass spots everywhere,
tons of skate parks, cheap


46
0:1:32,66 --> 0:1:36,45
drinks, mountains, babes.


47
0:1:36,45 --> 0:1:38,52
Dude, there's lots of hot
Mormon chicks there.


48
0:1:38,52 --> 0:1:40,83
MALE SPEAKER 3: And your
family's Mormon?


49
0:1:40,83 --> 0:1:41,58
LIZARD KING: Nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah, nah.


50
0:1:41,58 --> 0:1:43,8
MALE SPEAKER 3: That's
just a rumor I heard?


51
0:1:43,8 --> 0:1:43,91
LIZARD KING: Yeah, yeah, yeah.


52
0:1:43,91 --> 0:1:45,49
My mom's Catholic.


53
0:1:45,49 --> 0:1:48,17
My dad's a workaholic.


54
0:1:48,17 --> 0:1:50,67
MALE SPEAKER 3: Were they
supportive of you skating?


55
0:1:50,67 --> 0:1:53,62
LIZARD KING: Yeah, my mom
was super down for it.


56
0:1:53,62 --> 0:1:55,78
My dad, it took him a little
while to get into it.


57
0:1:55,78 --> 0:1:56,87
I think he was more hyped.


58
0:1:56,87 --> 0:1:58,9
Like I used to be really good
at riding bikes and shit.


59
0:1:58,9 --> 0:2:0,49
And he fuckin'--


60
0:2:0,49 --> 0:2:3,6
he was a pro motor cross
racer, so he's like--


61
0:2:3,6 --> 0:2:5,44
could relate with the bicycle
thing, you know?


62
0:2:5,44 --> 0:2:7,215
I'd asked for a new skateboard,
and he'd


63
0:2:7,215 --> 0:2:8,835
be, like, get a job.


64
0:2:8,835 --> 0:2:11,524
I'd ask for a fucking new part
for my bike, and he'd take me


65
0:2:11,524 --> 0:2:13,2
to the bike shop instantly
and go pay for it.


66
0:2:13,2 --> 0:2:14,56
[LAUGHS]


67
0:2:14,56 --> 0:2:17,392
MALE SPEAKER 3: Did your mom
trip out when you had tattoos?


68
0:2:17,392 --> 0:2:18,23
LIZARD KING: [LAUGH]


69
0:2:18,23 --> 0:2:21,9
Oh, yeah.


70
0:2:21,9 --> 0:2:24,39
Her and my dad were pretty
fucking pissed.


71
0:2:24,39 --> 0:2:26,62
My dad fucking hates tattoos
more than anything.


72
0:2:26,62 --> 0:2:29,2
I came home for Christmas.


73
0:2:29,2 --> 0:2:32,53
This was like, maybe a year or
two ago with fuckin' Salt Lake


74
0:2:32,53 --> 0:2:36,19
tattooed on my hands and the
Death Wish logo on my neck.


75
0:2:36,19 --> 0:2:37,99
And I rolled in, like, wearing
gloves and a hoodie.


76
0:2:37,99 --> 0:2:38,98
[LAUGHS]


77
0:2:38,98 --> 0:2:41,18
I was like, I can't
pull this off.


78
0:2:41,18 --> 0:2:42,21
And showed it to him.


79
0:2:42,21 --> 0:2:44,32
He was fucking pissed.


80
0:2:44,32 --> 0:2:46,33
Ruined Christmas.


81
0:2:46,33 --> 0:2:49,8
Fool, like, when he's pissed
off, this jaw muscle, he has


82
0:2:49,8 --> 0:2:51,99
this muscle right here, and it
just starts flexing, dude.


83
0:2:51,99 --> 0:2:55,2
Seriously, for like five
hours straight,


84
0:2:55,2 --> 0:2:56,27
that thing was like--


85
0:2:56,27 --> 0:2:58,67



86
0:2:58,67 --> 0:2:59,92
he wasn't hyped.


87
0:2:59,92 --> 0:3:9,18



88
0:3:9,18 --> 0:3:10,44
JUSTIN ROY: Lizard.


89
0:3:10,44 --> 0:3:13,85
I think he showed up at my house
in Fullerton when we


90
0:3:13,85 --> 0:3:16,74
used to have the old Hellrose.


91
0:3:16,74 --> 0:3:19,67
Yeah, he just kind of showed
up one day with a couple of


92
0:3:19,67 --> 0:3:21,52
other kids and never left.


93
0:3:21,52 --> 0:3:22,74
MALE SPEAKER 3: What
was Hellrose?


94
0:3:22,74 --> 0:3:24,88
JUSTIN ROY: Hellrose was just
a bunch of homeys in a place


95
0:3:24,88 --> 0:3:26,43
where we lived.


96
0:3:26,43 --> 0:3:29,37
Kind of a lifestyle, I guess you
could call it at the time.


97
0:3:29,37 --> 0:3:32,88
So we'd always just meet up in
the mornings, hang out, skate


98
0:3:32,88 --> 0:3:36,26
together, party together,
that kind of deal.


99
0:3:36,26 --> 0:3:37,893
MALE SPEAKER 3: What was his
skating like at first when you


100
0:3:37,893 --> 0:3:38,66
first met him?


101
0:3:38,66 --> 0:3:40,51
JUSTIN ROY: Total mad man.


102
0:3:40,51 --> 0:3:43,28
Mad man on a board, everywhere
we go, screaming at


103
0:3:43,28 --> 0:3:44,57
the top of his lungs.


104
0:3:44,57 --> 0:3:48,94
Just total madness is the
best way to describe it.


105
0:3:48,94 --> 0:3:53,9
ANDREW REYNOLDS: I knew some of
those guys, like Justin Roy


106
0:3:53,9 --> 0:3:54,57
and Sammy Baca.


107
0:3:54,57 --> 0:3:55,79
I didn't know all of them.


108
0:3:55,79 --> 0:3:57,66
But I just knew that
they were around.


109
0:3:57,66 --> 0:3:59,7
And they all looked really
dirty, bummy,


110
0:3:59,7 --> 0:4:0,81
and stuff, you know?


111
0:4:0,81 --> 0:4:3,1
But he was part of
that whole thing.


112
0:4:3,1 --> 0:4:6,42
And I saw him skate at one
night Active demo.


113
0:4:6,42 --> 0:4:7,66
But he was like--


114
0:4:7,66 --> 0:4:11,7
I mean, not saying he wasn't
good, but he just wasn't,


115
0:4:11,7 --> 0:4:14,28
like, the same Lizard
that he is now.


116
0:4:14,28 --> 0:4:17,79
It was like he was just kind of
going fast and really out


117
0:4:17,79 --> 0:4:20,205
of it, like ripping trim.


118
0:4:20,205 --> 0:4:21,92
MALE SPEAKER 3: Was he sponsored
at that point?


119
0:4:21,92 --> 0:4:23,86
JUSTIN ROY: Pig came along,
which was right around the


120
0:4:23,86 --> 0:4:25,37
time Hellrose was ending.


121
0:4:25,37 --> 0:4:29,4
And then everybody kind of
went to Pig from there.


122
0:4:29,4 --> 0:4:31,21
I just called the Beagle, Josh
Beagle, or whatever, and


123
0:4:31,21 --> 0:4:33,8
fucking hit him up and
asked him if I could


124
0:4:33,8 --> 0:4:35,42
skate for Pig Wood.


125
0:4:35,42 --> 0:4:37,9
The think dude, Tony Patel
or whatever, hit me up.


126
0:4:37,9 --> 0:4:40,595
He was like, dude, I'll cut you
a check right now if you


127
0:4:40,595 --> 0:4:41,79
want to skate for us.


128
0:4:41,79 --> 0:4:45,8
I mean, it sucks to be like,
yeah, I'm quitting for money.


129
0:4:45,8 --> 0:4:45,99
But I mean, whatever.


130
0:4:45,99 --> 0:4:48,33
I was fucking poor as shit,
living out here on people's


131
0:4:48,33 --> 0:4:49,25
couches, you know what I mean?


132
0:4:49,25 --> 0:4:52,47
It's like, I wasn't even getting
any product enough to


133
0:4:52,47 --> 0:4:54,22
be going and slinging
boards and shit.


134
0:4:54,22 --> 0:4:56,54
It's like, I skated
every board I had.


135
0:4:56,54 --> 0:5:0,15
And then, they started
Death Wish or


136
0:5:0,15 --> 0:5:1,9
whatever and then poof.


137
0:5:1,9 --> 0:5:2,34
ERIK ELLINGTON: Lizard actually
got a Death Wish


138
0:5:2,34 --> 0:5:5,72
tattoo before the company
was even started.


139
0:5:5,72 --> 0:5:8,7
We weren't even sure we
were going to do it.


140
0:5:8,7 --> 0:5:10,97
And I drew it on, like,
going down his ribs.


141
0:5:10,97 --> 0:5:14,65
We were on a Baker film trip
or something like that.


142
0:5:14,65 --> 0:5:16,22
And I was, like, yeah,
we want to start this


143
0:5:16,22 --> 0:5:18,75
company, Death Wish.


144
0:5:18,75 --> 0:5:20,78
I was like, you're on
when it starts.


145
0:5:20,78 --> 0:5:23,52
And we just clicked
from day one.


146
0:5:23,52 --> 0:5:24,79
And then I went skating
with him.


147
0:5:24,79 --> 0:5:27,66
And I was, like, obviously his
skating speaks for itself.


148
0:5:27,66 --> 0:5:29,6
And I didn't know he
was that good.


149
0:5:29,6 --> 0:5:29,74
I was just, like--


150
0:5:29,74 --> 0:5:31,42
I'd seen a couple of
those sequences.


151
0:5:31,42 --> 0:5:32,56
I was, like, oh shit--


152
0:5:32,56 --> 0:5:33,85
Cap from a board down a 12.


153
0:5:33,85 --> 0:5:35,59
But then when you go skate
with him, it's like, he's


154
0:5:35,59 --> 0:5:36,78
insane the way he works.


155
0:5:36,78 --> 0:5:39,42
He just adapts really
well to every single


156
0:5:39,42 --> 0:5:40,545
thing he tries to skate.


157
0:5:40,545 --> 0:5:42,72
It's rad to watch.


158
0:5:42,72 --> 0:5:48,26
JIM GRECO: When he does like a
nose blunt, like, he sawed a


159
0:5:48,26 --> 0:5:54,68
bar off and did a nose blunt
indie grab into a fucking bar


160
0:5:54,68 --> 0:5:56,83
bank type thing in Arizona.


161
0:5:56,83 --> 0:5:58,4
Eric was telling me
how sick he was.


162
0:5:58,4 --> 0:6:2,5
ANDREW REYNOLDS: And I met his
mom and like just his whole


163
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:4,29
family out in Salt Lake City.


164
0:6:4,29 --> 0:6:7,15
And his brother was telling me
when he wasn't around, like,


165
0:6:7,15 --> 0:6:12,25
yeah, everything he does
he's good at, always.


166
0:6:12,25 --> 0:6:14,9
Like he can do hand rails
and stuff on a bike.


167
0:6:14,9 --> 0:6:19,4
And he climbs rocks,
and he did the mega


168
0:6:19,4 --> 0:6:20,9
jump, skates vert.


169
0:6:20,9 --> 0:6:21,44
It's insane.


170
0:6:21,44 --> 0:6:25,29
He's like an adrenaline
junkie or something.


171
0:6:25,29 --> 0:6:27,95
LIZARD KING: I was like 15 at
the skate park, and this dude


172
0:6:27,95 --> 0:6:32,87
that was like my idol, I
worshipped him, he just walked


173
0:6:32,87 --> 0:6:35,48
up to me one day and said,
what's up, Lizard?


174
0:6:35,48 --> 0:6:38,9
And ever since then, it was
just, like, it was on.


175
0:6:38,9 --> 0:6:39,54
It's been stuck.


176
0:6:39,54 --> 0:6:40,555
He's the pumpkin king.


177
0:6:40,555 --> 0:6:42,476
His dad's the pumpkin master.


178
0:6:42,476 --> 0:6:44,23
And his daughter's the
pumpkin princess.


179
0:6:44,23 --> 0:8:44,23
