###10 From the fires of a sun's birth... twin planets emerged.
###18 Venus... and Earth.
###24 Two roads diverged in our young solar system. Nature draped one world in the greens and
###37 blues of life.
###37 While enveloping the other in acid clouds... high heat... and volcanic flows.
###47 Why did Venus take such a disastrous turn?
###54 For as long as we have gazed upon the stars, they have offered few signs... that somewhere
###64 out there... are worlds as rich and diverse as our own.
###70 Recently, though, astronomers have found ways to see into the bright lights of nearby stars.
###75 They've been discovering planets at a rapid clip... using observatories like NASA's Kepler
###83 space telescope...
###85 A French observatory known as Corot ...
###89 ...And an array of ground-based instruments. The count is approaching 500... and rising.
###95 These alien worlds run the gamut... from great gas giants many times the size of our Jupiter...
###104 to rocky, charred remnants that burned when their parent star exploded.
###111 Some have wild elliptical orbits... swinging far out into space... then diving into scorching
###117 stellar winds.
###121 Still others orbit so close to their parent stars that their surfaces are likely bathed
###126 in molten rock.
###129 Amid these hostile realms, a few bear tantalizing hints of water or ice... ingredients needed
###136 to nurture life as we know it.
###139 The race to find other Earths has raised anew the ancient question... whether, out in the
###144 folds of our galaxy, planets like our own are abundant... and life commonplace?
###151 Or whether Earth is a rare Garden of Eden in a barren universe?
###158 With so little direct evidence of these other worlds to go on, we have only the stories
###162 of planets within our own solar system to gauge the chances of finding another Earth.
###169 Consider, for example, a world that has long had the look and feel of a life-bearing planet.
###176 Except for the moon, there's no brighter light in our night skies than the planet Venus...
###182 known as both the morning and the evening star.
###184 The ancient Romans named it for their goddess of beauty and love.
###192 In time, the master painters transformed this classical symbol into an erotic figure.
###201 It was a scientist, Galileo Galilei, who demystified planet Venus... charting its phases as it
###208 moved around the sun, drawing it into the ranks of the other planets.
###212 With a similar size and weight, Venus became known as Earth's sister planet. But how Earth-like
###221 is it?
###223 The Russian scientist Mikkhail Lomonosov caught a tantalizing hint in 1761. As Venus passed
###230 in front of the Sun, he witnessed a hair thin luminescence on its edge.
###236 Venus, he found, has an atmosphere.
###244 Later observations revealed a thick layer of clouds. Astronomers imagined they were
###251 made of water vapor, like those on Earth. Did they obscure stormy, wet conditions below?
###257 And did anyone, or anything, live there? The answer came aboard an unlikely messenger....
###265 an asteroid that crashed into Earth.
###273 That is... according to the classic sci-fi adventure, The First Spaceship on Venus. A
###283 mysterious computer disk is found among the rubble.
###288 With
###294 anticipation rising on Earth, an international crew sets off to find out who sent it... and
###300 why.
###301 Approaching Venus, the astronauts translate the contents of the disk. The news is not
###318 good.
###319 In a desperate attempt to prevent an interplanetary war... and save their home planet... the crew
###331 embarks on a dangerous mission.
###335 They descend to the planet's dark surface to confront the adversaries.
###339 What they find is a treacherous, toxic world.
###360 No wonder the Venusians want to switch planets.
###369 It turns out that the aliens had already been destroyed... by their own machines.
###378 The new rulers of Venus are not in the mood for visitors.
###382 They repel the Earthlings with anti-gravity technology.
###393 Unfortunately, two astronauts are left behind to perish.
###406 So what if the aliens found a way to come to Earth?
###412 Think Zontar, the thing from Venus.
###417 It was now time to get serious about exploring our sister planet.
###427 BREAK
###431 NASA sent Mariner 2 to Venus in 1962... in the first-ever close planetary encounter.
###439 Its instruments showed that Venus is nothing at all like Earth. Rather, it's extremely
###444 hot, with an atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide.
###448 The data showed that Venus rotates very slowly... only once every 243 Earth days... and it goes
###456 in the opposite direction.
###458 American and Soviet scientists found out just how strange Venus is when they sent a series
###464 of landers down to take direct readings.
###467 Surface temperatures are almost 900 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead, with
###473 the air pressure 90 times higher than at sea level on Earth.
###477 The air is so thick that it's not a gas, but a "supercritical fluid." Liquid CO2.
###486 On our planet, the only naturally occurring source is in the high-temperature, high-pressure
###487 environments of undersea volcanoes. It comes in handy for extracting caffeine from coffee
###490 beans... or dry cleaning our clothes.
###492 You just wouldn't want to have to breathe it.
###498 The
###505 Soviet Venera landers sent back pictures showing that Venus is a vast garden of rock, with
###511 no water in sight.
###515 In fact, if you were to smooth out the surface of Venus, all the water in the atmosphere
###520 would be just 3 centimeters deep.
###523 Compare that to Earth... where the oceans would form a layer 3 kilometers deep.
###531 If you could land on Venus, you'd be treated to tranquil vistas and sunset skies, painted
###536 in orange hues.
###538 The winds are light, only a few miles per hour... but the air is so thick that a breeze
###544 would knock you over.
###546 Look up and you'd see fast-moving clouds... streaking around the planet at 300 kilometers
###555 per hour. These clouds form a dense high-altitude layer, from 45 to 66 kilometers above the
###564 surface.
###564 The clouds are so dense and reflective that Venus absorbs much less solar energy than
###570 Earth, even though it's 30% closer to the Sun.
###573 These clouds curve around into a pair of immense planetary hurricanes as the air spirals down
###581 into the cooler polar regions.
###583 They are made up mostly of sulfuric acid droplets... possibly a bi-product of sulfur dioxide emitted
###590 by volcanoes.
###592 Along the equator, they rise in powerful storms, unleashing bolts of lightning.
###598 Just like earth, these storms produce rain... only it's acid rain that evaporates before
###604 it hits the ground.
###605 At higher elevations, a fine mist forms... not of water but of the rare metal tellurium...
###613 and iron pyrites... known as fool's gold.
###616 It can form a metallic frost... like snowflakes in hell.
###624 Still, the mountains of Venus offer no relief from the heat. They are part of what makes
###629 Venus so extreme.
###634 Scientists have identified around 1700 major volcanic centers on Venus ranging from lava
###640 domes... and strange features called arachnoids or coronae... to giant volcanic summits.
###649 The planet is peppered with volcanoes, perhaps in the millions, distributed randomly on its
###654 surface. Venus is run through with huge cuts thousands of kilometers long that may well
###661 be lava channels.
###664 Our sister planet is a volcanic paradise, in a solar system shaped by volcanism.
###673 The largest mountain on Earth, Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano, measures 32,000 feet from sea
###680 floor to summit.
###682 Rising almost three times higher is the mother of all volcanoes: Olympus Mons on Mars.
###692 Jupiter's moon Io... is bleeding lava. It's produced deep underground by the friction
###700 of rock on rock, caused by the gravitational pull of its mother planet.
###702 Then there's Neptune's moon Triton... with crystals of nitrogen ice shooting some 10
###709 kilometers above the surface.
###713 Saturn's moon Titan... with frozen liquid methane and ammonia oozing into lakes and
###718 swamps.
###720 On our planet, volcanoes commonly form at the margins of continents and oceans, where
###726 steep mountainsides fall off into deep undersea trenches. Here, the vast slabs of rock that
###732 underlie the oceans push beneath those that bear the continents.
###738 Deep underground, friction between these plates can melt vast amounts of rock.
###744 Magma mixes with water... and the rising pressure forces it up... in explosive eruptions.
###751 On Earth, volcanoes can blast into the upper atmosphere, in a hail of ash, rock, dust,
###757 and lava.
###761 On Venus, the scene is very different. In the high-density atmosphere, volcanoes are
###769 more likely to ooze and splatter... sending rivers of lava flowing down onto the lowlands.
###776 They resemble volcanoes that form at hot spots like the Hawaiian islands. There, plumes of
###783 magma rise up from deep within the earth, releasing the pressure in a stream of eruptions.
###788 To see a typical large volcano on Venus, go to Sappas Mons... at 400 kilometers across
###798 and 1.5 kilometers high.
###802 The mountain was likely built through eruptions at its summit. But as magma reached up from
###807 below, it began to drain out through subsurface tubes or cracks that formed a web of channels
###813 leading onto the surrounding terrain.
###817 Is Venus, like Earth, still volcanically active?
###823 Finding the answer is a major goal of the Venus Express mission, launched in 2005 by
###829 the European Space Agency. Armed with a new generation of high-tech sensors, it peered
###835 through the clouds.
###837 Recording the infrared light given off by several large mountains, it found that the
###842 summits are brighter than the surrounding basins. That's probably because they had not
###847 been subject to as much weathering in this corrosive environment.
###852 This means that they would have erupted sometime within the last few hundred thousand years.
###858 If these volcanoes are active now, it's because they are part of a deeper process that shapes
###864 our planet as well.
###868 On Earth, the release of heat from radioactive decay deep in its mantle is what drives the
###874 motion of oceanic and continental plates.
###877 This process is dependent on erosion and other processes associated with water.
###885 With no water on Venus, the planet's internal heat builds to extreme levels, then escapes
###891 in outbreaks of volcanism that may be global in scope.
###894 That may explain why fewer than a thousand impact craters have been found on Venus. Anything
###901 older than about 500 million years has literally been paved over.
###907 So why did Venus diverge so radically from Earth when it was born in same solar system
###912 and under similar circumstances?
###914 BREAK
###916 There is growing evidence, still circumstantial, that Venus may in fact have had a wetter,
###921 more Earth-like past.
###923 One of the most startling findings of the early Venus missions was the presence of deuterium,
###929 a form of hydrogen, in Venus' upper atmosphere. It forms when ultraviolet sunlight breaks
###936 apart water molecules.
###938 Additional evidence recently came to light. Venus Express trained its infrared sensors
###946 on the planet's night side... to look at how the terrain emits the energy captured in the
###952 heat of the day.
###955 This picture is a composite of over a thousand individual images of Venus' southern hemisphere.
###962 Higher elevation areas, shown in blue, emit less heat than the surrounding basins.
###968 That supports a hypothesis that these areas are made not of lava, but of granite.
###976 On Earth, granite forms in volcanoes when magma mixes with water. If there's granite
###983 on Venus, then there may well have been water.
###989 If Earth and Venus emerged together as twin blue marbles... then at some point, the two
###994 worlds parted company.
###996 Earth developed ways to moderate its climate, in part by removing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse
###1003 gas, from its atmosphere.
###1009 Plants, for one, absorb CO2 and release oxygen in photosynthesis. One square kilometer of
###1017 tropical jungle, for example, can take in several hundred tons of co2 in just a year.
###1025 That's nothing compared to the oceans. In a year's time, according to one recent study,
###1030 just one square kilometer of ocean can absorb 41 million tons of CO2.
###1036 Earth takes in its own share of CO2. When rainfall interacts with rocks, a chemical
###1045 reaction known as "weathering" converts atmospheric CO2 to carbonate compounds. Runoff from the
###1052 land washes it into rivers and the seas... where they settle into ocean sediments.
###1058 To understand how much this can influence the climate, look back into Earth's history.
###1064 The formation of the Himalayan Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau around 50 million years
###1069 ago exposed massive amounts of rock... and led to an increase in rainfall.
###1074 Over time, so much CO2 was removed from the atmosphere through weathering that it sent
###1083 Earth into a period of global cooling that has lasted to this day.
###1091 With little water and no oceans, Venus has no good way to remove CO2 from its atmosphere.
###1097 Instead, with volcanic eruptions adding more and more CO2 to the atmosphere, it has trapped
###1103 more and more of the sun's heat in a runaway greenhouse effect.
###1109 Venus is so hot that liquid water simply cannot survive on the surface.
###1114 Nor, it now seems, can it last in the upper atmosphere.
###1120 As our solar system moves around the galaxy, it is lashed by a fierce wind of charged particles.
###1127 The sun blocks this galactic wind with a powerful solar wind.
###1132 It reaches its peak in the wake of great looping eruptions on the surface of the Sun, called
###1137 coronal mass ejections.
###1139 Fortunately, Earth has its own line of defense.
###1144 Plumes of hot magma rise and fall in Earth's core as it spins, generating a magnetic field
###1149 that extends far out into space.
###1151 It acts as a shield, deflecting the solar wind and causing it to flow past.
###1158 It's this protective bubble that Venus lacks.
###1163 Venus Express found that these solar winds are steadily stripping off lighter molecules
###1167 of hydrogen and oxygen. They escape the planet on the night side... then ride solar breezes
###1174 on out into space.
###1175 All this may be due to Venus' size... 80% that of Earth. This prevents the formation
###1183 of a solid iron core... and with it the rising and falling plumes that generate a strong
###1188 magnetic field.
###1190 There may be another reason too... according to a theory about the planet's early years.
###1197 A young planet Venus encountered one or more planet-sized objects... in violent collisions.
###1202 The force of these impacts slowed its rotation to a crawl... and reversed it... reducing
###1212 the chances that a magnetic field could take hold.
###1217 This does not mean that Venus was Earth-like. Another theory holds that the planet's primordial
###1222 oceans were actually held as vapor in its atmosphere... and replenished by icy comets
###1228 in the early years of the solar system.
###1233 So what can we glean from the evolution of planet Venus?
###1237 For one thing, as we continue to scan the cosmic horizons for worlds that may resemble
###1243 our own, the story of Venus will stand as a stark reminder.
###1248 It takes more than just the right size, composition, and distance from the parent star... for a
###1255 planet to become truly Earth-like.
###1259 No matter how promising a planet may be, there are myriad forces out there that can radically
###1266 alter its course.
###1268 For here was a world... Venus... poised perhaps on the brink of a glorious future.
###1276 But bad luck passed its way. Now, we can only imagine... what might have become of Earth's
###1285 sister planet?
