1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:16,9
TIM HARRINGTON: Nashville--


2
0:0:16,9 --> 0:0:17,97
Music City.


3
0:0:17,97 --> 0:0:20,26
Our time here's tight so
we gotta make it quick.


4
0:0:20,26 --> 0:0:23,8
Our man on the ground is Ben
Swank, Nashville musical


5
0:0:23,8 --> 0:0:26,3
kingpin and Jack White's right
hand man on Third Man Records.


6
0:0:26,3 --> 0:0:28,18
I just called him and he
sent me straight to


7
0:0:28,18 --> 0:0:29,2
Phil Kaufman's house--


8
0:0:29,2 --> 0:0:30,45
AKA, The Mangler.


9
0:0:30,45 --> 0:0:46,72



10
0:0:46,72 --> 0:0:49,37
He's a national celebrity and
probably the most infamous


11
0:0:49,37 --> 0:0:52,53
roadie ever for many reasons,
but none moreso than for


12
0:0:52,53 --> 0:0:56,31
stealing Gram Parson's
body and burning it.


13
0:0:56,31 --> 0:0:58,59
I've heard he's an amazing
character and an unmatched


14
0:0:58,59 --> 0:1:1,282
storyteller, but he'll eat you
for breakfast if he doesn't


15
0:1:1,282 --> 0:1:3,14
like the look of you.


16
0:1:3,14 --> 0:1:4,39
So I've got my best pants on.


17
0:1:4,39 --> 0:1:9,102



18
0:1:9,102 --> 0:1:10,66
Phil Kaufman, I presume?


19
0:1:10,66 --> 0:1:11,994
PHIL KAUFMAN: Hey man
thanks for waiting.


20
0:1:11,994 --> 0:1:12,958
TIM HARRINGTON: How's
it going?


21
0:1:12,958 --> 0:1:13,93
PHIL KAUFMAN: Good
to see you, man.


22
0:1:13,93 --> 0:1:14,95
TIM HARRINGTON: Good to see
you-- it's Tim Harrington.


23
0:1:14,95 --> 0:1:15,29
PHIL KAUFMAN: Do you
want to go inside?


24
0:1:15,29 --> 0:1:18,14
TIM HARRINGTON: Sure


25
0:1:18,14 --> 0:1:20,16
PHIL KAUFMAN: This is
the Casa De Mangler.


26
0:1:20,16 --> 0:1:22,98
All my memorabilia
is on the wall--


27
0:1:22,98 --> 0:1:23,79
and in my mind.


28
0:1:23,79 --> 0:1:28,54
Over here, there's the wall of
shame with Steve Earle, and


29
0:1:28,54 --> 0:1:30,815
Emmylou, Gram Parsons.


30
0:1:30,815 --> 0:1:32,34
TIM HARRINGTON: I love
this picture.


31
0:1:32,34 --> 0:1:34,12
PHIL KAUFMAN: Oh
this one here.


32
0:1:34,12 --> 0:1:35,34
That's early rock and roll--


33
0:1:35,34 --> 0:1:38,22
money, cocaine, hashish,
and a gun--


34
0:1:38,22 --> 0:1:39,76
[INAUDIBLE] off to work.


35
0:1:39,76 --> 0:1:40,21
TIM HARRINGTON: That's
all you need.


36
0:1:40,21 --> 0:1:41,355
PHIL KAUFMAN: Up
to the office.


37
0:1:41,355 --> 0:1:42,705
Up to the office, yeah.


38
0:1:42,705 --> 0:1:47,3
I celebrated 3/4 of a century
and no progress last year--


39
0:1:47,3 --> 0:1:49,94
76 this year and still at it.


40
0:1:49,94 --> 0:1:52,29
Still riding motorcycles, scuba
diving, and chasing


41
0:1:52,29 --> 0:1:53,21
younger women--


42
0:1:53,21 --> 0:1:56,7
you know, 65, 70--


43
0:1:56,7 --> 0:1:57,32
the young girls.


44
0:1:57,32 --> 0:2:2,21



45
0:2:2,21 --> 0:2:4,47
TIM HARRINGTON: How did
you get started?


46
0:2:4,47 --> 0:2:5,51
PHIL KAUFMAN: When I
got out of prison--


47
0:2:5,51 --> 0:2:7,61
I was a marijuana felon
in the '60s--


48
0:2:7,61 --> 0:2:11,15
so my buddy called me up and
said Mick Jagger and Marianne


49
0:2:11,15 --> 0:2:13,46
Faithfull were coming to LA.


50
0:2:13,46 --> 0:2:15,5
And they needed somebody to
drive them around-- somebody


51
0:2:15,5 --> 0:2:16,87
new to the area--


52
0:2:16,87 --> 0:2:19,42
the guy bought me a pair of
shoes, and it was time to go


53
0:2:19,42 --> 0:2:22,82
to the studio doing mixing
of Beggars Banquet.


54
0:2:22,82 --> 0:2:25,99
And I got to the studio and they
said, who's there, and I


55
0:2:25,99 --> 0:2:27,986
said Rolling Stones.


56
0:2:27,986 --> 0:2:30,28
They said, they're not here,
I said yeah they're here.


57
0:2:30,28 --> 0:2:32,58
I heard the guy in the back
says, they're not only here on


58
0:2:32,58 --> 0:2:34,56
the right day, they're
on time.


59
0:2:34,56 --> 0:2:36,33
And I said they're going to
be on time every day.


60
0:2:36,33 --> 0:2:39,61
So I drove them back
to their house--


61
0:2:39,61 --> 0:2:42,3
brand new '68 Cadillac
convertible--


62
0:2:42,3 --> 0:2:43,4
and Mick said, how are
you getting home?


63
0:2:43,4 --> 0:2:45,156
I said, I'm going to
have to walk--


64
0:2:45,156 --> 0:2:46,6
I didn't have any money--


65
0:2:46,6 --> 0:2:47,88
and Mick says, oh shit.


66
0:2:47,88 --> 0:2:49,3
He took $1,500--


67
0:2:49,3 --> 0:2:51,39
all the money he had in his
pocket-- handed it to me, gave


68
0:2:51,39 --> 0:2:54,19
me the keys to the car, and
said, see you tomorrow.


69
0:2:54,19 --> 0:2:55,765
TIM HARRINGTON: Yeah,
[INAUDIBLE] a little bit


70
0:2:55,765 --> 0:2:57,13
better than [INAUDIBLE]
horror movies.


71
0:2:57,13 --> 0:2:58,59
PHIL KAUFMAN:That was my first
day in the music business.


72
0:2:58,59 --> 0:2:59,34
All of a sudden--


73
0:2:59,34 --> 0:3:0,662
I said this is pretty good.


74
0:3:0,662 --> 0:3:3,73
Than Gram Parsons came in
about a week later.


75
0:3:3,73 --> 0:3:6,76
Gram asked me if I'd
work for the Flying


76
0:3:6,76 --> 0:3:8,5
Burrito Brothers, touring.


77
0:3:8,5 --> 0:3:10,78
And I said, what does
a road manager do?


78
0:3:10,78 --> 0:3:12,63
He said, well, it's
the same thing you


79
0:3:12,63 --> 0:3:13,4
did with the Stones--


80
0:3:13,4 --> 0:3:13,88
you know how--


81
0:3:13,88 --> 0:3:15,38
you just take it on the road.


82
0:3:15,38 --> 0:3:16,96
I said, oh shit,
I can do that.


83
0:3:16,96 --> 0:3:18,3
TIM HARRINGTON: But I'd like
to talk about Gram.


84
0:3:18,3 --> 0:3:20,33
PHIL KAUFMAN: Well,
I met Gram--


85
0:3:20,33 --> 0:3:22,68
as I said, through the Flying
Burrito Brothers--


86
0:3:22,68 --> 0:3:25,64
and we went to a funeral for
Clarence White, who was the


87
0:3:25,64 --> 0:3:26,91
guitar player for the Byrds.


88
0:3:26,91 --> 0:3:30,52
And Gram and everybody there
were saying, if Clarence had


89
0:3:30,52 --> 0:3:31,94
his choice, if would definitely
not have been his


90
0:3:31,94 --> 0:3:32,95
choice of a funeral--
it would have been a


91
0:3:32,95 --> 0:3:34,34
little bit more subtle.


92
0:3:34,34 --> 0:3:40,12
So Gram and I had a few
sherbets, and we each said, if


93
0:3:40,12 --> 0:3:42,8
I die first, I want you to take
my body out to the desert


94
0:3:42,8 --> 0:3:43,51
and burn it.


95
0:3:43,51 --> 0:3:44,34
I said, me too.


96
0:3:44,34 --> 0:3:44,97
Is it a deal?


97
0:3:44,97 --> 0:3:46,43
And we shook on it.


98
0:3:46,43 --> 0:3:49,12
Course the asshole died
several months later.


99
0:3:49,12 --> 0:3:51,46
And I'm sitting around the
house playing should've.


100
0:3:51,46 --> 0:3:53,811
I should've been with him, I
shouldn't have let him do


101
0:3:53,811 --> 0:3:54,56
this, I should've--


102
0:3:54,56 --> 0:3:57,61
So anyhow, my girlfriend says,
get off your ass and to do it.


103
0:3:57,61 --> 0:3:58,67
So I did.


104
0:3:58,67 --> 0:4:2,28
I borrowed a hearse from a
friend, went out to LAX and


105
0:4:2,28 --> 0:4:5,26
convinced them that the family
wanted the body flown out to


106
0:4:5,26 --> 0:4:6,9
New Orleans.


107
0:4:6,9 --> 0:4:7,63
TIM HARRINGTON: So you just took
him out to Joshua Tree?


108
0:4:7,63 --> 0:4:9,3
PHIL KAUFMAN: I took him out to
Joshua Tree and opened up


109
0:4:9,3 --> 0:4:10,46
the casket.


110
0:4:10,46 --> 0:4:11,75
We used to play this game-- what
have you got something on


111
0:4:11,75 --> 0:4:13,8
your shirt?


112
0:4:13,8 --> 0:4:15,57
That was the last thing
he got from me.


113
0:4:15,57 --> 0:4:19,25
And then I put the gas on him
and said see you around pal.


114
0:4:19,25 --> 0:4:20,899
I lit a match and threw it in.


115
0:4:20,899 --> 0:4:22,47
It went-- boom.


116
0:4:22,47 --> 0:4:26,13
It was a big flame ball of
oxygen as the gasoline


117
0:4:26,13 --> 0:4:27,97
ignited, and I could
see his ashes


118
0:4:27,97 --> 0:4:29,325
going up into the desert.


119
0:4:29,325 --> 0:4:30,92
I said, my job's done here.


120
0:4:30,92 --> 0:4:33,32
And then we left.


121
0:4:33,32 --> 0:4:37,41
A couple of days later the
police arrested me for grand


122
0:4:37,41 --> 0:4:38,66
theft Parsons.


123
0:4:38,66 --> 0:4:41,53



124
0:4:41,53 --> 0:4:44,97
TIM HARRINGTON: You produced
Manson's record.


125
0:4:44,97 --> 0:4:45,39
PHIL KAUFMAN: Yeah.


126
0:4:45,39 --> 0:4:46,8
TIM HARRINGTON: Is it true
you worked on it?


127
0:4:46,8 --> 0:4:46,75
PHIL KAUFMAN: Yeah, Charlie--


128
0:4:46,75 --> 0:4:47,18
Charlie Manson.


129
0:4:47,18 --> 0:4:50,445
I've got the original
copies inside.


130
0:4:50,445 --> 0:4:50,77
TIM HARRINGTON: Oh yeah?


131
0:4:50,77 --> 0:4:52,1
PHIL KAUFMAN: Yeah,
I'll show you.


132
0:4:52,1 --> 0:4:53,29
I heard him singing in
the prison yard--


133
0:4:53,29 --> 0:4:55,68
he sounded like a young
Frankie Laine.


134
0:4:55,68 --> 0:4:57,75
So when I got out, I stayed with
Charlie and the family


135
0:4:57,75 --> 0:4:58,74
for awhile.


136
0:4:58,74 --> 0:5:1,59
I have had sex with more
murderers than


137
0:5:1,59 --> 0:5:3,87
anybody in show business.


138
0:5:3,87 --> 0:5:8,14
But then Charlie got a little
crazy and I said, I got to go.


139
0:5:8,14 --> 0:5:11,748
He said, you can't stay here--
you're too smart.


140
0:5:11,748 --> 0:5:13,18
TIM HARRINGTON: He's like,
you've got to be the smartest


141
0:5:13,18 --> 0:5:13,31
one around.


142
0:5:13,31 --> 0:5:14,29
PHIL KAUFMAN: You
can't be smart


143
0:5:14,29 --> 0:5:15,38
hanging out with Charlie--


144
0:5:15,38 --> 0:5:17,28
Charlie does the thinking.


145
0:5:17,28 --> 0:5:21,3
Here's something-- the original
Charles Manson


146
0:5:21,3 --> 0:5:24,91
album-- we only did 300 of them,
but it's been bootlegged


147
0:5:24,91 --> 0:5:26,8
for quite a few years now.


148
0:5:26,8 --> 0:5:29,73
He gave me the rights to his
music-- and this is just taken


149
0:5:29,73 --> 0:5:33,0
from 1/4 inch tape-- it's not a
very good mix, but it's the


150
0:5:33,0 --> 0:5:34,89
original one.


151
0:5:34,89 --> 0:5:36,76
He used to call me occasionally,
and the last


152
0:5:36,76 --> 0:5:39,55
time he called me he was
rambling on and on.


153
0:5:39,55 --> 0:5:43,5
And I said, Charlie, the
difference between you and I


154
0:5:43,5 --> 0:5:46,8
is that you're doing life
and I'm living it.


155
0:5:46,8 --> 0:5:47,15
He said, you think
that's funny?


156
0:5:47,15 --> 0:5:48,87
I said it's fucking
hysterical--


157
0:5:48,87 --> 0:5:50,58
don't call me again.


158
0:5:50,58 --> 0:5:54,131
And I hung up on him and I
haven't heard from him since.


159
0:5:54,131 --> 0:5:57,54
I hope I haven't offended him.


160
0:5:57,54 --> 0:6:0,27
Those murderers are so touchy.


161
0:6:0,27 --> 0:6:2,11
TIM HARRINGTON: Was part of
your job ever involving


162
0:6:2,11 --> 0:6:3,44
scoring tail for the bands?


163
0:6:3,44 --> 0:6:5,29
Or have they got that
covered on this own?


164
0:6:5,29 --> 0:6:6,78
PHIL KAUFMAN: If somebody sees
somebody they like--


165
0:6:6,78 --> 0:6:7,43
a girl--


166
0:6:7,43 --> 0:6:7,89
we'll wave at her.


167
0:6:7,89 --> 0:6:10,95
I'll just give her a backstage
pass and then bring her back.


168
0:6:10,95 --> 0:6:12,11
Like Sweet Connie--


169
0:6:12,11 --> 0:6:13,2
you ever heard of
Sweet Connie?


170
0:6:13,2 --> 0:6:19,6
Connie was a schoolteacher in
Little Rock, Arkansas, and she


171
0:6:19,6 --> 0:6:20,98
used to come out--


172
0:6:20,98 --> 0:6:22,39
can I say "blow job?"


173
0:6:22,39 --> 0:6:23,915
TIM HARRINGTON: You can say blow
job, you can say, suck


174
0:6:23,915 --> 0:6:24,94
cock-- you can say whatever
you want.


175
0:6:24,94 --> 0:6:26,93
PHIL KAUFMAN: She would come
back to service the band and


176
0:6:26,93 --> 0:6:30,49
then do their laundry when
they come to her town.


177
0:6:30,49 --> 0:6:32,76
And then some of them would fly
her out there-- and she'd


178
0:6:32,76 --> 0:6:34,26
do the same thing--


179
0:6:34,26 --> 0:6:36,6
and I've seen the
top of her head.


180
0:6:36,6 --> 0:6:40,51



181
0:6:40,51 --> 0:6:42,595
But she's notorious--


182
0:6:42,595 --> 0:6:44,562
everybody knows Sweet Connie.


183
0:6:44,562 --> 0:6:46,8
TIM HARRINGTON: I want
to know Sweet Connie.


184
0:6:46,8 --> 0:6:46,645
PHIL KAUFMAN: She's in a book.


185
0:6:46,645 --> 0:6:47,895
These are pictures in my book.


186
0:6:47,895 --> 0:6:51,19



187
0:6:51,19 --> 0:6:54,17
My job is to get them to work
as gracefully as possible,


188
0:6:54,17 --> 0:6:55,28
plug them in in, and
out of their.


189
0:6:55,28 --> 0:6:58,24
Way I don't like the them and
us attitude that some


190
0:6:58,24 --> 0:6:59,2
musicians have.


191
0:6:59,2 --> 0:7:1,1
The roadies are them--


192
0:7:1,1 --> 0:7:2,7
and then the musicians
are [INAUDIBLE]


193
0:7:2,7 --> 0:7:4,7
We're all together.


194
0:7:4,7 --> 0:7:6,26
These guys aren't plugging
it in, you ain't shit.


195
0:7:6,26 --> 0:7:7,25
TIM HARRINGTON: You're
a lifer?


196
0:7:7,25 --> 0:7:9,25
PHIL KAUFMAN: I'm
a lifer, yeah.


197
0:7:9,25 --> 0:7:14,58
But it's show-business
God I love it.


198
0:7:14,58 --> 0:7:15,83
TIM HARRINGTON: Good
ol' Mangler.


199
0:7:15,83 --> 0:7:18,9



200
0:7:18,9 --> 0:7:21,21
I was just getting started in
my stories about Zappa, and


201
0:7:21,21 --> 0:7:24,492
Morrison, and Joe Cocker,
but I had to go to meet


202
0:7:24,492 --> 0:7:26,76
Nashville guy, Ben.


203
0:7:26,76 --> 0:7:27,69
What is this place?


204
0:7:27,69 --> 0:7:30,44
BEN SWANK: This is our record
store, where we sell all of


205
0:7:30,44 --> 0:7:32,34
our Third Man wares.


206
0:7:32,34 --> 0:7:35,4
So the idea is like,
the old Sun


207
0:7:35,4 --> 0:7:36,11
Records or Fortune Records--


208
0:7:36,11 --> 0:7:38,0
something like that-- where you
record the records in the


209
0:7:38,0 --> 0:7:39,84
back and then sell them
in the front.


210
0:7:39,84 --> 0:7:41,38
So we only sell Third
Man stuff.


211
0:7:41,38 --> 0:7:45,482
All of our miscellany, t-shirts,
45 [INAUDIBLE]


212
0:7:45,482 --> 0:7:48,77
all kinds of random
novelty, and junk.


213
0:7:48,77 --> 0:7:49,78
TIM HARRINGTON: The dude
that sells black


214
0:7:49,78 --> 0:7:51,86
lacquer in town is psyched.


215
0:7:51,86 --> 0:7:53,73
BEN SWANK: He's psyched.


216
0:7:53,73 --> 0:7:55,67
We do a lot of shows back too.


217
0:7:55,67 --> 0:7:58,21
A few of Jack's bands
played, obviously--


218
0:7:58,21 --> 0:7:59,99
all the bands on the
label play here.


219
0:7:59,99 --> 0:8:1,815
TIM HARRINGTON: So
this is a live--


220
0:8:1,815 --> 0:8:4,69
BEN SWANK: The live room--
holds about 300 people.


221
0:8:4,69 --> 0:8:6,19
This is where we do
photo shoots,


222
0:8:6,19 --> 0:8:7,75
video shoots back here.


223
0:8:7,75 --> 0:8:10,5
Far as we know, it's the only
venue where you can record


224
0:8:10,5 --> 0:8:11,21
straight to analog tape.


225
0:8:11,21 --> 0:8:11,96
TIM HARRINGTON: Straight
to analog tape.


226
0:8:11,96 --> 0:8:14,31
BEN SWANK: Jack produces and
mixes all of the [INAUDIBLE]


227
0:8:14,31 --> 0:8:15,31
albums himself--


228
0:8:15,31 --> 0:8:17,37
so he's really hands
on with all of it.


229
0:8:17,37 --> 0:8:18,5
TIM HARRINGTON: That's cool.


230
0:8:18,5 --> 0:8:21,8
For me, I'm really into
whale-watching.


231
0:8:21,8 --> 0:8:22,1
You lay down--


232
0:8:22,1 --> 0:8:23,48
naked--


233
0:8:23,48 --> 0:8:25,55
and you look down, and you're
trying to give yourself a


234
0:8:25,55 --> 0:8:27,42
boner without touching.


235
0:8:27,42 --> 0:8:31,55
And it kind of like, flops
around like a whale.


236
0:8:31,55 --> 0:8:35,162
And you can look down, and be
like, whoa, she breached.


237
0:8:35,162 --> 0:8:37,7
BEN SWANK: I've never
done that.


238
0:8:37,7 --> 0:8:37,72
TIM HARRINGTON: [INAUDIBLE]


239
0:8:37,72 --> 0:8:40,274
BEN SWANK: See that's weird.


240
0:8:40,274 --> 0:8:42,409
We just met.


241
0:8:42,409 --> 0:8:43,774
I'm sensitive.


242
0:8:43,774 --> 0:8:45,24
TIM HARRINGTON: I understand.


243
0:8:45,24 --> 0:8:47,682



244
0:8:47,682 --> 0:8:49,35
Oh man, I always get a
little too friendly


245
0:8:49,35 --> 0:8:50,76
and mess things up.


246
0:8:50,76 --> 0:8:52,685
Ben doesn't seem too
mad though--


247
0:8:52,685 --> 0:8:55,43
he said he's going to take me
to Glen Danzig's house.


248
0:8:55,43 --> 0:8:57,99
It's like a house party place,
where these dudes put on shows


249
0:8:57,99 --> 0:9:0,415
in their house, and
I was like, yes.


250
0:9:0,415 --> 0:9:3,96



251
0:9:3,96 --> 0:9:6,275
While these guys set up a show,
I can work on my new


252
0:9:6,275 --> 0:9:9,682
Nashville-inspired, four-part,
electronic opus.

0:9:9,682 --> 0:9:36,47
[ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING]


254
0:9:36,47 --> 0:9:39,461
TIM HARRINGTON: Is that a
longstanding tradition in


255
0:9:39,461 --> 0:9:41,9
Nashville to have a black-out
[INAUDIBLE] --


256
0:9:41,9 --> 0:9:42,652
to have punk spaces?


257
0:9:42,652 --> 0:9:43,36
BEN TODD: Sort of.


258
0:9:43,36 --> 0:9:45,86
It comes and goes.


259
0:9:45,86 --> 0:9:49,97
I usually run the door and run
the sound and make sure bands


260
0:9:49,97 --> 0:9:51,44
are going on time.


261
0:9:51,44 --> 0:9:52,87
TIM HARRINGTON: What's
happening tonight?


262
0:9:52,87 --> 0:9:54,38
Let's talk about the lineup.


263
0:9:54,38 --> 0:9:57,8
BEN TODD: Having a show with Big
Surr, Cy Barkley and the


264
0:9:57,8 --> 0:9:59,924
Way Outsiders, and
Natural Child.


265
0:9:59,924 --> 0:10:0,78
TIM HARRINGTON: Natural
Child, I really like.


266

BEN TODD:Local lords.

268

of Natural Child are you?

WES: I'm Wes.

- I pee turned around
at interviews.

it's hitting your shoes.

0:10:41,53 --> 0:10:42,39
- It's all right--

I've got boots on.

0:10:43,3 --> 0:10:44,82
TIM HARRINGTON: You guys
are road dogs.


282

Where are you guys from?


283
0:10:46,81 --> 0:10:47,24
WES: Nashville, Tennessee.

0:10:47,24 --> 0:10:48,8
TIM HARRINGTON: Right here?


285
0:10:48,8 --> 0:10:50,12
What do you guys travel in

286
0:10:50,12 --> 0:10:51,85
- A minivan.

TIM HARRINGTON: Mini V?

0:10:53,54 --> 0:10:56,775
- But don't show it because we
don't want the police to know.

you on the road for when


290
0:10:58,373 --> 0:10:59,9
you're on tour?


291
0:10:59,9 --> 0:10:59,25
Long stints?


292
0:10:59,25 --> 0:11:0,72
Little short runs?


293
0:11:0,72 --> 0:11:3,7
- Never more than two
or three weeks.

said you guys were road dogs.

0:11:5,58 --> 0:11:6,53

One, I want Mangler

Two, I want to live in
