1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:5,83



2
0:0:5,83 --> 0:0:9,3
HAMILTON MORRIS: Dearest
Krystle, I cannot express the


3
0:0:9,3 --> 0:0:12,3
excitement within me when I
think that shortly we will


4
0:0:12,3 --> 0:0:13,72
meet face to face.


5
0:0:13,72 --> 0:0:16,92



6
0:0:16,92 --> 0:0:20,49
Over the years, I've read your
books and watched your videos,


7
0:0:20,49 --> 0:0:23,16
perused court documents,
police records, and


8
0:0:23,16 --> 0:0:26,78
affidavits, yet I still feel
confused about what happened


9
0:0:26,78 --> 0:0:33,46
between you, Todd, and the LSD
laboratory so many years ago.


10
0:0:33,46 --> 0:0:36,6
I hope that when we are
together, I will finally


11
0:0:36,6 --> 0:0:39,71
understand what transpired,
and the truth will shine


12
0:0:39,71 --> 0:0:42,69
brightly as a crystal
in the Kansas sky.


13
0:0:42,69 --> 0:0:45,69



14
0:0:45,69 --> 0:0:48,145
Much love, Hamilton.


15
0:0:48,145 --> 0:0:57,48



16
0:0:57,48 --> 0:1:0,61
Krystle Cole is one of the most
unlikely figures in the


17
0:1:0,61 --> 0:1:2,32
psychedelic community.


18
0:1:2,32 --> 0:1:5,88
A Goth stripper from Kansas
whose introduction to the


19
0:1:5,88 --> 0:1:9,57
psychedelic underground came in
February of 2000, when she


20
0:1:9,57 --> 0:1:13,43
fell deeply in love with a
mysterious man named Todd, who


21
0:1:13,43 --> 0:1:17,29
was the heir to a spring
manufacturing fortune.


22
0:1:17,29 --> 0:1:20,52
She quit her job as a dancer
and moved in with Todd at a


23
0:1:20,52 --> 0:1:23,49
decommissioned nuclear missile
silo that served as his


24
0:1:23,49 --> 0:1:26,23
private pleasure of
lysergic delights.


25
0:1:26,23 --> 0:1:29,2



26
0:1:29,2 --> 0:1:31,98
Exactly what happened in that
laboratory at the dawn of the


27
0:1:31,98 --> 0:1:35,8
new millennium is still a
subject of heated debate.


28
0:1:35,8 --> 0:1:38,43
But it is known that Todd formed
a partnership with


29
0:1:38,43 --> 0:1:41,2
Leonard Pickard, an accomplished
clandestine


30
0:1:41,2 --> 0:1:42,81
psychedelic chemist.


31
0:1:42,81 --> 0:1:45,66
And together they began to
assemble what would have been


32
0:1:45,66 --> 0:1:48,46
the world's largest LSD lab.


33
0:1:48,46 --> 0:1:51,48
But before the lab could be put
into full operation, it


34
0:1:51,48 --> 0:1:55,78
was destroyed by the DEA.


35
0:1:55,78 --> 0:1:58,94
After verifying that my
intentions were pure, Krystle


36
0:1:58,94 --> 0:2:1,94
agreed to meet with me to
discuss her involvement in the


37
0:2:1,94 --> 0:2:5,83
lab and take me on a guided tour
of the subterranean LSD


38
0:2:5,83 --> 0:2:9,45
palace that she once
called home.


39
0:2:9,45 --> 0:2:19,82



40
0:2:19,82 --> 0:2:23,98
Last night we flew into Kansas
City, and right now we're on


41
0:2:23,98 --> 0:2:27,18
our way to meet Krystle Cole.


42
0:2:27,18 --> 0:2:29,78
Outside of what she's written in
her book, Lysergic, and her


43
0:2:29,78 --> 0:2:31,6
numerous YouTube videos,
there's very


44
0:2:31,6 --> 0:2:32,905
little known about her.


45
0:2:32,905 --> 0:2:34,99
I have a lot of questions.


46
0:2:34,99 --> 0:2:36,969
I've wanted to meet her
for a long time.


47
0:2:36,969 --> 0:2:42,47



48
0:2:42,47 --> 0:2:43,72
Here we are.


49
0:2:43,72 --> 0:2:46,44



50
0:2:46,44 --> 0:2:47,44
Hey, what's going on?


51
0:2:47,44 --> 0:2:49,28
It's Hamilton.


52
0:2:49,28 --> 0:2:51,26
Nice to meet you.


53
0:2:51,26 --> 0:2:53,59
KRYSTLE COLE: I was raised in a
small Kansas town, which is


54
0:2:53,59 --> 0:2:56,77
comparable to being sucked into
a spiritual black hole.


55
0:2:56,77 --> 0:3:0,4
I was surrounded by flat, bleak
cornfields farmed by


56
0:3:0,4 --> 0:3:2,11
similarly flat, bleak people.


57
0:3:2,11 --> 0:3:5,285
At a young age, my classmates
labeled me as a nerd, causing


58
0:3:5,285 --> 0:3:6,99
me to never quite fit in.


59
0:3:6,99 --> 0:3:9,64
The first thing that comes to
mind upon reflection is, thank


60
0:3:9,64 --> 0:3:11,35
god for being an outcast.


61
0:3:11,35 --> 0:3:13,18
My peers were the perfect
example of white


62
0:3:13,18 --> 0:3:14,81
trash at its worst.


63
0:3:14,81 --> 0:3:16,92
The majority of them had already
given birth to a


64
0:3:16,92 --> 0:3:18,43
couple children and dropped
out of high


65
0:3:18,43 --> 0:3:20,4
school because of it.


66
0:3:20,4 --> 0:3:22,79
No aspirations existed in their
minds beyond the next


67
0:3:22,79 --> 0:3:25,26
round of incestuous
sex, six-pack of


68
0:3:25,26 --> 0:3:27,36
beer, and line of meth.


69
0:3:27,36 --> 0:3:29,24
HAMILTON MORRIS: Krystle is
one of very few people


70
0:3:29,24 --> 0:3:32,82
surrounding the bust who is not
currently incarcerated.


71
0:3:32,82 --> 0:3:35,59
And in the wake of extraordinary
heartbreak,


72
0:3:35,59 --> 0:3:39,59
trials, and prison sentences,
she used her life experience


73
0:3:39,59 --> 0:3:43,13
to inspire a variety of
informational YouTube videos


74
0:3:43,13 --> 0:3:46,85
that have garnered much
attention across the internet.


75
0:3:46,85 --> 0:3:49,59
KRYSTLE COLE: So this is the
green screen that I use to


76
0:3:49,59 --> 0:3:51,91
shoot all the NeuroSoup
videos.


77
0:3:51,91 --> 0:3:54,36
So I came up with the name
NeuroSoup because it's


78
0:3:54,36 --> 0:3:58,29
basically the combination of
neurology and then the soup,


79
0:3:58,29 --> 0:4:0,71
we all have this soup of
different neurotransmitters in


80
0:4:0,71 --> 0:4:1,39
our brains.


81
0:4:1,39 --> 0:4:4,5
And so drugs affect these
neurotransmitters, and so


82
0:4:4,5 --> 0:4:7,23
that's kind of how I came up
with the name NeuroSoup.


83
0:4:7,23 --> 0:4:8,5
HAMILTON MORRIS: Mm.


84
0:4:8,5 --> 0:4:11,67
You were saying that your most
popular YouTube video is the


85
0:4:11,67 --> 0:4:14,7
Shamanic Colonic
anal DMT video.


86
0:4:14,7 --> 0:4:14,42
-Hi.


87
0:4:14,42 --> 0:4:18,14
Some people have gotten onto the
NeuroSoup forum and asked


88
0:4:18,14 --> 0:4:20,82
me about the time that
I took DMT anally.


89
0:4:20,82 --> 0:4:23,27
And so today I want to describe
that for you guys.


90
0:4:23,27 --> 0:4:25,0
There are some benefits to it.


91
0:4:25,0 --> 0:4:28,47
I've only done it anally once,
because I guess the negative


92
0:4:28,47 --> 0:4:30,8
side effect to it, while I'm
talking about all the


93
0:4:30,8 --> 0:4:33,967
positives, is that it burned
really bad, and it just kind


94
0:4:33,967 --> 0:4:36,3
of put me in this weird
head space.


95
0:4:36,3 --> 0:4:38,44
KRYSTLE COLE: That was my most
popular one until YouTube


96
0:4:38,44 --> 0:4:41,4
forced me to remove it because
of its new community content


97
0:4:41,4 --> 0:4:42,55
guidelines.


98
0:4:42,55 --> 0:4:45,332
There's some other paintings
and more


99
0:4:45,332 --> 0:4:47,145
paintings and more fractals.


100
0:4:47,145 --> 0:4:49,81
I kind of have them on
the walls everywhere.


101
0:4:49,81 --> 0:4:53,18
And of course, Grateful
Dead bears.


102
0:4:53,18 --> 0:4:56,8
That one is the one that I put
on my first edition of


103
0:4:56,8 --> 0:4:57,69
Lysergic book cover.


104
0:4:57,69 --> 0:4:58,4
It's my favorite one.


105
0:4:58,4 --> 0:5:0,94
And the language around the side
of it are things that I


106
0:5:0,94 --> 0:5:2,65
kind of saw when I was
tripping, these


107
0:5:2,65 --> 0:5:4,5
alienesque-type languages.


108
0:5:4,5 --> 0:5:6,492
I don't know what you
would call it.


109
0:5:6,492 --> 0:5:8,83
HAMILTON MORRIS: Can you talk
about just the things you talk


110
0:5:8,83 --> 0:5:11,59
about the beginning of Lysergic,
how you initially


111
0:5:11,59 --> 0:5:13,47
got involved in all of this?


112
0:5:13,47 --> 0:5:15,86
KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah, well, I
met Todd at a strip club.


113
0:5:15,86 --> 0:5:19,1
I worked there for about
three months.


114
0:5:19,1 --> 0:5:20,94
And he came in--


115
0:5:20,94 --> 0:5:22,52
well, actually, one of
his employees came


116
0:5:22,52 --> 0:5:23,72
in and saw me first.


117
0:5:23,72 --> 0:5:25,9
And then they went back, and
they said, oh, there's this


118
0:5:25,9 --> 0:5:27,25
girl down there you should
see, kind of thing.


119
0:5:27,25 --> 0:5:28,71
So then he came and met me.


120
0:5:28,71 --> 0:5:32,43
And shortly thereafter, I was
driving one of his Porsches


121
0:5:32,43 --> 0:5:35,42
and living at his
missile site.


122
0:5:35,42 --> 0:5:37,42
HAMILTON MORRIS: I asked Krystle
to take me on a tour


123
0:5:37,42 --> 0:5:40,53
of the silo, which is now
owned by a vintage tank


124
0:5:40,53 --> 0:5:42,24
enthusiast.


125
0:5:42,24 --> 0:5:45,37
It will be the first time
Krystle has entered the silo


126
0:5:45,37 --> 0:5:48,22
since her romance with Todd.


127
0:5:48,22 --> 0:5:50,967
When Todd was seducing
you, what kinds of


128
0:5:50,967 --> 0:5:52,21
things would he say?


129
0:5:52,21 --> 0:5:53,506
KRYSTLE COLE: Oh, boy.


130
0:5:53,506 --> 0:5:55,28
I don't know.


131
0:5:55,28 --> 0:5:59,1
Um, at first he was
very gentlemanly.


132
0:5:59,1 --> 0:6:0,49
It wasn't like he was drugging
me and taking


133
0:6:0,49 --> 0:6:1,51
advantage or anything.


134
0:6:1,51 --> 0:6:4,86
At first he was being the utmost
gentleman, to try to


135
0:6:4,86 --> 0:6:7,15
win my trust over.


136
0:6:7,15 --> 0:6:9,215
HAMILTON MORRIS: On the way,
we passed the place Krystle


137
0:6:9,215 --> 0:6:11,46
and Todd first met--


138
0:6:11,46 --> 0:6:15,96
Club Orleans, one of Topeka's
premier exotic dance


139
0:6:15,96 --> 0:6:17,3
establishments.


140
0:6:17,3 --> 0:6:18,8
KRYSTLE COLE: This was the club
that I met Todd, although


141
0:6:18,8 --> 0:6:20,43
it was a different
name back then.


142
0:6:20,43 --> 0:6:22,72
They've kind of remodeled
since then.


143
0:6:22,72 --> 0:6:24,69
I did kind of an interesting
act.


144
0:6:24,69 --> 0:6:26,17
I did a bondage act.


145
0:6:26,17 --> 0:6:27,44
And so I--


146
0:6:27,44 --> 0:6:30,55
really stood out for the Kansas
crowd that's in there.


147
0:6:30,55 --> 0:6:33,12
I would play death metal music,
and I had this, like,


148
0:6:33,12 --> 0:6:35,61
chain that I would hold around
my neck with a dog collar.


149
0:6:35,61 --> 0:6:37,44
I'd wrap it around the pole
and stuff, and I'd


150
0:6:37,44 --> 0:6:38,69
whip myself on stage.


151
0:6:38,69 --> 0:6:41,26



152
0:6:41,26 --> 0:6:42,57
I was really into
Goth back then.


153
0:6:42,57 --> 0:6:45,83
Because I really hated Kansas,
and I was just rebelling


154
0:6:45,83 --> 0:6:48,17
against everything that this
whole place was about.


155
0:6:48,17 --> 0:6:49,46
And so he comes in there.


156
0:6:49,46 --> 0:6:52,965
He was sort of like
the mad scientist.


157
0:6:52,965 --> 0:6:55,92
If you can imagine, like, a guy
walking around with this


158
0:6:55,92 --> 0:6:58,67
big metal briefcase,
you know, bald--


159
0:6:58,67 --> 0:7:0,88
and his hair, like, what hair
is left sticking up


160
0:7:0,88 --> 0:7:2,33
everywhere.


161
0:7:2,33 --> 0:7:5,37
His clothes rattered,
tattered everywhere.


162
0:7:5,37 --> 0:7:8,46
He would come in there and just
sit with me and pay me


163
0:7:8,46 --> 0:7:12,2
like lots and lots of money just
to hang out in the VIP


164
0:7:12,2 --> 0:7:12,52
room with him.


165
0:7:12,52 --> 0:7:14,1
And he would sit there
for the whole day.


166
0:7:14,1 --> 0:7:15,82
And we did that for
a couple of times.


167
0:7:15,82 --> 0:7:18,41
And then he's like, well, why
don't you just come out to


168
0:7:18,41 --> 0:7:19,18
where I live, and stuff?


169
0:7:19,18 --> 0:7:20,35
And I was like, well, OK.


170
0:7:20,35 --> 0:7:22,17
I'll go out to your
place with you.


171
0:7:22,17 --> 0:7:24,16
They have a policy where you're
not supposed to leave


172
0:7:24,16 --> 0:7:24,55
with customers.


173
0:7:24,55 --> 0:7:25,6
You're not supposed
to do that.


174
0:7:25,6 --> 0:7:28,27
And I never would have done
that, but Todd was so


175
0:7:28,27 --> 0:7:30,152
persuasive.


176
0:7:30,152 --> 0:7:33,1
And so, I kind of gave in.


177
0:7:33,1 --> 0:7:34,22
I probably shouldn't have.


178
0:7:34,22 --> 0:7:36,1
If I wouldn't have met him, I
wouldn't have had all this


179
0:7:36,1 --> 0:7:37,4
horrible stuff happen.


180
0:7:37,4 --> 0:7:39,82
But I also wouldn't have had
all the cool stuff happen.


181
0:7:39,82 --> 0:7:42,29
He drove Porsches and
had lots of money.


182
0:7:42,29 --> 0:7:45,3
And, you know, he bought me
Armani clothes and gave me


183
0:7:45,3 --> 0:7:46,13
money, and I didn't
have to work at


184
0:7:46,13 --> 0:7:47,1
the strip club anymore.


185
0:7:47,1 --> 0:7:49,11
So I was like, hey,
let's party.


186
0:7:49,11 --> 0:7:50,36
I didn't care.


187
0:7:50,36 --> 0:7:52,68



188
0:7:52,68 --> 0:7:56,46
I'm kind of excited to see what
it looks like in there.


189
0:7:56,46 --> 0:7:59,54
I think it's going to bring
back a lot of memories.


190
0:7:59,54 --> 0:8:1,76
HAMILTON MORRIS: As we drew
near the legendary missile


191
0:8:1,76 --> 0:8:5,52
silo, I tried to imagine Krystle
arriving here with


192
0:8:5,52 --> 0:8:8,53
Todd for the very first time.


193
0:8:8,53 --> 0:8:10,54
KRYSTLE COLE: You used to have
to call in using this system


194
0:8:10,54 --> 0:8:13,73
right there, or you'd
have an access code.


195
0:8:13,73 --> 0:8:16,68
HAMILTON MORRIS: Upon entering
this silo, Krystle left the


196
0:8:16,68 --> 0:8:20,86
spiritual black hole of Kansas
behind forever and was


197
0:8:20,86 --> 0:8:23,97
introduced to Todd and Leonard's
underground ring of


198
0:8:23,97 --> 0:8:29,85
chemists, dealers, and drug
enforcement agents.


199
0:8:29,85 --> 0:8:31,56
KRYSTLE COLE: These tunnels
are really fun when you're


200
0:8:31,56 --> 0:8:34,679
tripping, because they'll start
swirling on you and


201
0:8:34,679 --> 0:8:36,25
you'll be, like, hanging
on, like, ahh!


202
0:8:36,25 --> 0:8:40,429



203
0:8:40,429 --> 0:8:42,78
HAMILTON MORRIS: And what was
your experience with drugs


204
0:8:42,78 --> 0:8:46,2
before having met Gordon
"Todd" Skinner?


205
0:8:46,2 --> 0:8:47,49
KRYSTLE COLE: Virtually none.


206
0:8:47,49 --> 0:8:52,16
Of course, I did the normal
drinking alcohol, smoking pot.


207
0:8:52,16 --> 0:8:55,13
I tried meth twice and
I did coke once.


208
0:8:55,13 --> 0:8:56,21
But other than that--


209
0:8:56,21 --> 0:8:57,86
I'd never even heard of MDMA.


210
0:8:57,86 --> 0:8:59,56
I didn't even know
what it was.


211
0:8:59,56 --> 0:9:1,3
All I know is, he's like, it'll
make you feel good.


212
0:9:1,3 --> 0:9:2,7
Just try it.


213
0:9:2,7 --> 0:9:2,69
You like it.


214
0:9:2,69 --> 0:9:2,96
Don't worry.


215
0:9:2,96 --> 0:9:4,11
You'll like it.


216
0:9:4,11 --> 0:9:6,62
And boy, did I.


217
0:9:6,62 --> 0:9:10,9
Back then, I was on so many
different substances.


218
0:9:10,9 --> 0:9:13,7
It was like living in an
entheogenic monastery, because


219
0:9:13,7 --> 0:9:13,97
I didn't have to work.


220
0:9:13,97 --> 0:9:15,92
I didn't have to worry
about paying bills.


221
0:9:15,92 --> 0:9:20,2
I didn't have to do anything
other than use psychedelics


222
0:9:20,2 --> 0:9:22,65
and pray to the god
that we all share.


223
0:9:22,65 --> 0:9:25,26



224
0:9:25,26 --> 0:9:28,27
The whole situation was centered
around tripping, so


225
0:9:28,27 --> 0:9:29,88
we just wanted to
be comfortable.


226
0:9:29,88 --> 0:9:32,71
This here is the missile bay.


227
0:9:32,71 --> 0:9:35,61
About where the tanks are is
where we had a platform set up


228
0:9:35,61 --> 0:9:38,37
with a stereo, and we would have
a couple of king-sized


229
0:9:38,37 --> 0:9:41,19
beds in here and a bunch of
different couches, like


230
0:9:41,19 --> 0:9:42,79
leather couches and things.


231
0:9:42,79 --> 0:9:45,83
That way we could hang out and
have plenty of places to sit


232
0:9:45,83 --> 0:9:48,64
down and lay down or whatever.


233
0:9:48,64 --> 0:9:51,41
HAMILTON MORRIS: Todd spent
money with wild abandon,


234
0:9:51,41 --> 0:9:55,56
decorating the silo with stone
statues, Persian carpets,


235
0:9:55,56 --> 0:9:59,31
cedar saunas, a marble bathroom
with a tub large


236
0:9:59,31 --> 0:10:1,85
enough to accommodate a
half-dozen people, and a


237
0:10:1,85 --> 0:10:6,5
$120,000 stereo system, which
he used to play both Sarah


238
0:10:6,5 --> 0:10:10,84
McLachlan and Deep Forest at
extremely high volumes.


239
0:10:10,84 --> 0:10:25,26
[MUSIC PLAYING]


240
0:10:25,26 --> 0:10:27,0
KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah, we would
all get in here and shower.


241
0:10:27,0 --> 0:10:28,9
There was lots of nudity.


242
0:10:28,9 --> 0:10:31,6
You can imagine, you
know, lots of cute


243
0:10:31,6 --> 0:10:33,932
girls running around.


244
0:10:33,932 --> 0:10:36,205
And the parties were-- could
get really wild.


245
0:10:36,205 --> 0:10:39,6



246
0:10:39,6 --> 0:10:42,45
One of the things they really
liked to do was have IVs set


247
0:10:42,45 --> 0:10:45,93
up and have some DMT or some
5-MeO in the IV bottle.


248
0:10:45,93 --> 0:10:48,52
They would sit there, and then
they would like, crank it up


249
0:10:48,52 --> 0:10:49,47
so they'd start tripping more.


250
0:10:49,47 --> 0:10:51,41
And then they'd roll it down
a little bit to kind of--


251
0:10:51,41 --> 0:10:54,1
and so you could, like-- he
would like surf in the DMT


252
0:10:54,1 --> 0:10:56,18
high, you know?


253
0:10:56,18 --> 0:10:59,1
I would do a lot,
but not that.


254
0:10:59,1 --> 0:11:1,32
Todd seemed like the most
spiritual person


255
0:11:1,32 --> 0:11:3,1
you would ever meet.


256
0:11:3,1 --> 0:11:4,8
And when we would trip
together, it was


257
0:11:4,8 --> 0:11:6,68
like, I don't know.


258
0:11:6,68 --> 0:11:9,26
Tripping with him is different
than tripping with anyone I've


259
0:11:9,26 --> 0:11:10,57
ever tripped with, you know?


260
0:11:10,57 --> 0:11:12,85
And we experienced things like
telepathy together, and you


261
0:11:12,85 --> 0:11:16,28
know, we experienced
God, if you want to


262
0:11:16,28 --> 0:11:18,33
label it that, together.


263
0:11:18,33 --> 0:11:21,9
HAMILTON MORRIS: Krystle was
exposed to a cornucopia of


264
0:11:21,9 --> 0:11:24,45
psychedelic substances, ranging
from the more common


265
0:11:24,45 --> 0:11:30,1
chemicals like LSD, DMT, and
MDMA to such rarities as


266
0:11:30,1 --> 0:11:36,49
ALD-52, ergot wine, a variety
of fluorinated AMT analogs,


267
0:11:36,49 --> 0:11:38,57
and a mysterious substance
made by


268
0:11:38,57 --> 0:11:43,8
Leonard called diazedine.


269
0:11:43,8 --> 0:11:47,6
Unbeknownst to Krystle, Todd
and Leonard began to argue,


270
0:11:47,6 --> 0:11:51,14
and Todd was slowly overcome by
fear of both Leonard and an


271
0:11:51,14 --> 0:11:55,0
impending bust by the DEA.


272
0:11:55,0 --> 0:11:57,165
KRYSTLE COLE: Todd was so
secretive about everything.


273
0:11:57,165 --> 0:12:0,78
A couple weeks before the bust
happened, he gave me some MDMA


274
0:12:0,78 --> 0:12:2,58
and said, go in the bedroom and
trip and leave me alone.


275
0:12:2,58 --> 0:12:3,46
Don't come out here.


276
0:12:3,46 --> 0:12:5,915
So I was like, pretty high,
and I came out there, and


277
0:12:5,915 --> 0:12:6,593
like, what are you doing?


278
0:12:6,593 --> 0:12:7,75
I'm bored.


279
0:12:7,75 --> 0:12:9,1
And so then I got to
see all the stuff.


280
0:12:9,1 --> 0:12:12,15
He had pictures of Leonard and
all this stuff about Leonard,


281
0:12:12,15 --> 0:12:13,79
like this huge file on him.


282
0:12:13,79 --> 0:12:15,66
Looking back on it, I should've
known something was


283
0:12:15,66 --> 0:12:17,58
getting ready to come down when
he had all that stuff


284
0:12:17,58 --> 0:12:18,86
out, because then I could
have said, Leonard,


285
0:12:18,86 --> 0:12:20,17
you gotta watch out.


286
0:12:20,17 --> 0:12:21,99
KSNT REPORTER: Wamego residents
say they were


287
0:12:21,99 --> 0:12:25,68
shocked when DEA agents arrived
into town on November


288
0:12:25,68 --> 0:12:28,45
6, looking for drug fugitives.


289
0:12:28,45 --> 0:12:31,68
HAMILTON MORRIS: In October
2000, Todd formally contacted


290
0:12:31,68 --> 0:12:35,1
the DEA and declared that he
would like to turn in the


291
0:12:35,1 --> 0:12:39,4
world's largest LSD
manufacturing conspiracy.


292
0:12:39,4 --> 0:12:42,12
Todd received total immunity for
his involvement with the


293
0:12:42,12 --> 0:12:45,45
laboratory and walked away a
free man, while Leonard was


294
0:12:45,45 --> 0:12:48,94
chased by the DEA, outrunning
them on foot and hiding in a


295
0:12:48,94 --> 0:12:52,9
barn with his body covered
with cold leaves to evade


296
0:12:52,9 --> 0:12:54,46
thermal cameras.


297
0:12:54,46 --> 0:12:57,75
The following day, Leonard was
turned in by a farmer and


298
0:12:57,75 --> 0:13:0,74
eventually given two concurrent
life sentences


299
0:13:0,74 --> 0:13:4,42
without parole.


300
0:13:4,42 --> 0:13:6,31
MALE SPEAKER: Wamego Police
Department were brought in to


301
0:13:6,31 --> 0:13:10,1
assist in the manhunt, which
ended up being an 18-hour hunt


302
0:13:10,1 --> 0:13:10,95
for the individual.


303
0:13:10,95 --> 0:13:14,33
KSNT REPORTER: DEA agents
believe the LSD lab is one of


304
0:13:14,33 --> 0:13:16,42
the largest in the world.


305
0:13:16,42 --> 0:13:18,62
HAMILTON MORRIS: After the
bust, Krystle and Todd


306
0:13:18,62 --> 0:13:21,8
traveled across the country for
three years with a small


307
0:13:21,8 --> 0:13:24,35
group of ravers and drug
enthusiasts, selling


308
0:13:24,35 --> 0:13:27,91
phosphorescent capsules of
MDMA and living like


309
0:13:27,91 --> 0:13:29,94
psychedelic royalty in Seattle,


310
0:13:29,94 --> 0:13:32,59
Mendocino, Tucson, and Tulsa.


311
0:13:32,59 --> 0:13:34,55
KRYSTLE COLE: Here's our
California house.


312
0:13:34,55 --> 0:13:36,54
We had our own private
beach down there.


313
0:13:36,54 --> 0:13:39,3
We would try to get the best
we could everywhere.


314
0:13:39,3 --> 0:13:40,6
HAMILTON MORRIS: There were
peacocks on the property?


315
0:13:40,6 --> 0:13:41,54
KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah.


316
0:13:41,54 --> 0:13:41,86
Yeah.


317
0:13:41,86 --> 0:13:43,43
There were peacocks
on the property.


318
0:13:43,43 --> 0:13:44,87
You would think having
peacocks would be


319
0:13:44,87 --> 0:13:47,11
cool, but it wasn't.


320
0:13:47,11 --> 0:13:48,88
Outside of our houses was
all these Amanitas.


321
0:13:48,88 --> 0:13:50,7
And so we would go pick
Amanitas and stuff.


322
0:13:50,7 --> 0:13:52,91
You can see us, we're
identifying them and


323
0:13:52,91 --> 0:13:53,86
researching them.


324
0:13:53,86 --> 0:13:56,82
Some of these don't have Todd in
them, because he didn't let


325
0:13:56,82 --> 0:13:57,35
us take a lot of pictures.


326
0:13:57,35 --> 0:14:0,2
There towards the end, I think
all the stress of the court


327
0:14:0,2 --> 0:14:2,92
case, and everything, you know,
the years of running,


328
0:14:2,92 --> 0:14:4,8
and the years of all the
problems, you know, just


329
0:14:4,8 --> 0:14:6,46
really were piling in on him.


330
0:14:6,46 --> 0:14:8,7
And I think that he was
just kind of going


331
0:14:8,7 --> 0:14:10,74
a little bit crazy.


332
0:14:10,74 --> 0:14:13,72
Todd was very much escalating
things.


333
0:14:13,72 --> 0:14:17,25
He started abusing me,
like literally


334
0:14:17,25 --> 0:14:18,5
physically abusing me.


335
0:14:18,5 --> 0:14:20,57
I was willing to look over some
of the bad stuff that I


336
0:14:20,57 --> 0:14:24,35
started to see the first couple
years, because, oh, I


337
0:14:24,35 --> 0:14:26,63
know underneath all this,
it's just the stress.


338
0:14:26,63 --> 0:14:27,44
It's just temporary.


339
0:14:27,44 --> 0:14:30,18
Underneath all that, he's this
beautiful, spiritual person.


340
0:14:30,18 --> 0:14:32,14
And he's doing all this
for good reasons.


341
0:14:32,14 --> 0:14:35,54
And now looking back on
it, no, he was just


342
0:14:35,54 --> 0:14:36,69
manipulating me.


343
0:14:36,69 --> 0:14:37,61
I was--


344
0:14:37,61 --> 0:14:40,1
I was just a stupid girl.


345
0:14:40,1 --> 0:14:41,67
You know?


346
0:14:41,67 --> 0:14:43,91
He always had a couple of
other girlfriends, and I


347
0:14:43,91 --> 0:14:45,18
always had boyfriends.


348
0:14:45,18 --> 0:14:47,95
And we were each other's
primary, you know, I mean, but


349
0:14:47,95 --> 0:14:49,68
like we always had other
people around.


350
0:14:49,68 --> 0:14:53,66
And so the boyfriend at the
time, Brad, he was the first


351
0:14:53,66 --> 0:14:57,27
guy over the years that I dated
that wanted-- that said,


352
0:14:57,27 --> 0:14:58,6
look, this situation's
no good.


353
0:14:58,6 --> 0:14:59,85
You need to get away
from this.


354
0:14:59,85 --> 0:15:2,322
And so, so I'm like, OK, well,
the only way for us to get out


355
0:15:2,322 --> 0:15:6,62
of this is for us to go to the
DEA and basically do what Todd


356
0:15:6,62 --> 0:15:8,95
did to Leonard to Todd.


357
0:15:8,95 --> 0:15:12,6
And so we go to the DEA
together, and we basically


358
0:15:12,6 --> 0:15:15,725
spill everything about Todd's
local operation that he's got


359
0:15:15,725 --> 0:15:16,44
going there.


360
0:15:16,44 --> 0:15:19,55
They were already familiar with
the Pickard case and all


361
0:15:19,55 --> 0:15:20,12
that stuff.


362
0:15:20,12 --> 0:15:22,83
And so they knew who I was, that
I was Todd's girlfriend


363
0:15:22,83 --> 0:15:23,25
and all that.


364
0:15:23,25 --> 0:15:24,3
They had a case.


365
0:15:24,3 --> 0:15:24,94
They had me.


366
0:15:24,94 --> 0:15:26,3
They had the boyfriend.


367
0:15:26,3 --> 0:15:27,89
And I told them where
one of his labs was.


368
0:15:27,89 --> 0:15:30,9
So they had more than enough
of a case, and more than


369
0:15:30,9 --> 0:15:31,1
enough of a reason
to go after him.


370
0:15:31,1 --> 0:15:32,24
You know what they said to me?


371
0:15:32,24 --> 0:15:33,57
They're like, well, we'll
give you a call.


372
0:15:33,57 --> 0:15:34,6
And I'm like, OK.


373
0:15:34,6 --> 0:15:35,56
And so they had my
phone number.


374
0:15:35,56 --> 0:15:36,18
So I go home.


375
0:15:36,18 --> 0:15:39,13
And then conveniently, two days
later, Todd called me up.


376
0:15:39,13 --> 0:15:40,72
Well, I know you went
into the DEA.


377
0:15:40,72 --> 0:15:41,99
HAMILTON MORRIS: So you
went into the DEA.


378
0:15:41,99 --> 0:15:43,87
You told them that
he was dangerous.


379
0:15:43,87 --> 0:15:46,16
They took down all
the information.


380
0:15:46,16 --> 0:15:48,76
Didn't do anything at
all to stop him.


381
0:15:48,76 --> 0:15:51,7
But told him that you had
reported him and just


382
0:15:51,7 --> 0:15:53,2
infuriated him?


383
0:15:53,2 --> 0:15:53,62
KRYSTLE COLE: Yes.


384
0:15:53,62 --> 0:15:57,4
And that is why he kidnapped me
and Brad and did the things


385
0:15:57,4 --> 0:15:58,84
that he did to us.


386
0:15:58,84 --> 0:16:2,57
HAMILTON MORRIS: On the 4th of
July, 2003, believing he was


387
0:16:2,57 --> 0:16:6,9
immune to legal prosecution,
Todd lured Krystle and Brad to


388
0:16:6,9 --> 0:16:9,39
the Tulsa Doubletree Inn.


389
0:16:9,39 --> 0:16:12,67
Shortly after meeting, Todd
offered Brad a communion wafer


390
0:16:12,67 --> 0:16:15,7
laced with an unknown
psilocin analog.


391
0:16:15,7 --> 0:16:17,99
KRYSTLE COLE: The next thing I
know, he's duct-taped up, and


392
0:16:17,99 --> 0:16:19,58
they were injecting
him with stuff.


393
0:16:19,58 --> 0:16:22,74
And they were telling me, you
know, if you don't obey


394
0:16:22,74 --> 0:16:24,94
everything we say, we're going
to give him something that's


395
0:16:24,94 --> 0:16:25,71
going to kill him.


396
0:16:25,71 --> 0:16:27,6
And we have to get information
out of him.


397
0:16:27,6 --> 0:16:29,4
We have to know what he said.


398
0:16:29,4 --> 0:16:32,18
HAMILTON MORRIS: As the drug
took effect, Todd taped Brad


399
0:16:32,18 --> 0:16:35,28
up and spent one week subjecting
him to psychedelic


400
0:16:35,28 --> 0:16:37,65
tortures of unfathomable
depravity.


401
0:16:37,65 --> 0:16:41,8



402
0:16:41,8 --> 0:16:44,89
KRYSTLE COLE: I know that he
was giving him stuff like


403
0:16:44,89 --> 0:16:48,11
barbiturates and things
like Valium and stuff.


404
0:16:48,11 --> 0:16:48,69
HAMILTON MORRIS: But
he was using


405
0:16:48,69 --> 0:16:50,43
psychedelics as a truth serum?


406
0:16:50,43 --> 0:16:50,68
KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah.


407
0:16:50,68 --> 0:16:53,28
And he was using psychedelics
as well.


408
0:16:53,28 --> 0:16:55,27
He was giving him IV DMT.


409
0:16:55,27 --> 0:16:57,525
Any drug he had, he pretty much
was giving it to him.


410
0:16:57,525 --> 0:17:0,16
You know, and after that, after
it was over, I had to


411
0:17:0,16 --> 0:17:1,3
stay with Todd for
a whole month.


412
0:17:1,3 --> 0:17:3,445
And I mean, he drugged me, he
raped me, he sodomized me, he


413
0:17:3,445 --> 0:17:4,97
did horrible things to me.


414
0:17:4,97 --> 0:17:7,46
It's hard for me to talk about,
because I have PTSD now


415
0:17:7,46 --> 0:17:9,3
because of what he did.


416
0:17:9,3 --> 0:17:11,13
But I mean, it's horrendous.


417
0:17:11,13 --> 0:17:13,77
I mean, to think that somebody
would use psychedelics for the


418
0:17:13,77 --> 0:17:16,2
kinds of things he
used them for.


419
0:17:16,2 --> 0:17:18,26
HAMILTON MORRIS: Todd fled to
Burning Man, where he was


420
0:17:18,26 --> 0:17:21,71
arrested for MDMA distribution
and ultimately tried for


421
0:17:21,71 --> 0:17:25,26
kidnapping and assault with
a dangerous weapon.


422
0:17:25,26 --> 0:17:29,555
For these acts, Todd was
sentenced to life in prison.


423
0:17:29,555 --> 0:17:35,953



424
0:17:35,953 --> 0:17:37,99
KRYSTLE COLE: Todd was so tall
that he had to really watch


425
0:17:37,99 --> 0:17:40,885
out for those things, or he
would hit his head on them.


426
0:17:40,885 --> 0:17:43,61



427
0:17:43,61 --> 0:17:44,1
KRYSTLE COLE: Yeah.


428
0:17:44,1 --> 0:17:47,314
He has life, so you don't have
to worry about him coming back


429
0:17:47,314 --> 0:17:49,45
and haunting the place here.


430
0:17:49,45 --> 0:17:51,58
Once you trip a lot, you can
make any trip a pleasant


431
0:17:51,58 --> 0:17:53,4
experience.


432
0:17:53,4 --> 0:17:55,67
Unless the person's literally
standing above you and


433
0:17:55,67 --> 0:17:58,84
injecting you and strangling
and threatening you and


434
0:17:58,84 --> 0:18:0,65
yelling at you and stuff.


435
0:18:0,65 --> 0:18:4,87
You can't-- there's no way
to make that good.


436
0:18:4,87 --> 0:18:7,42
The last few years have been a
difficult road for me to walk


437
0:18:7,42 --> 0:18:10,33
down, yet they have made me
a much better person.


438
0:18:10,33 --> 0:18:13,45
I got so far out of touch with
a normal person's reality.


439
0:18:13,45 --> 0:18:16,55
For years, I never worked a job,
watched television, or


440
0:18:16,55 --> 0:18:18,4
even went a week without
being around someone


441
0:18:18,4 --> 0:18:19,92
who was on an entheogen.


442
0:18:19,92 --> 0:18:22,47
I basically had to start
life all over.


443
0:18:22,47 --> 0:18:24,85
I began watching the news to
get up to speed on current


444
0:18:24,85 --> 0:18:28,45
events, got an apartment of my
own, and started a business to


445
0:18:28,45 --> 0:18:29,35
support myself.


446
0:18:29,35 --> 0:18:32,84
I feel like even after four
years, I'm still working on


447
0:18:32,84 --> 0:18:35,1
reintegrating into society.


448
0:18:35,1 --> 0:18:37,9
In the spirit of actually doing
something with what I've


449
0:18:37,9 --> 0:18:40,21
learned through entheogens, I
founded a nonprofit website


450
0:18:40,21 --> 0:18:41,79
called NeuroSoup.com.


451
0:18:41,79 --> 0:18:44,48
My hope is that it will be a
place for people to learn,


452
0:18:44,48 --> 0:18:47,28
share their beliefs about
spirituality, entheogens, and


453
0:18:47,28 --> 0:18:48,12
themselves.


454
0:18:48,12 --> 0:18:49,37
Namaste.


455
0:18:49,37 --> 0:18:52,28



456
0:18:52,28 --> 0:18:53,29
HAMILTON MORRIS: After
everything that has


457
0:18:53,29 --> 0:18:56,24
transpired, Krystle still
considers Todd


458
0:18:56,24 --> 0:18:59,1
the love of her life.


459
0:18:59,1 --> 0:19:3,24
We are all brothers in the
family of humanity, and life


460
0:19:3,24 --> 0:19:8,42
is a cosmic giggle on the
breath of the universe.


461
0:19:8,42 --> 0:19:9,67
Namaste.


462
0:19:9,67 --> 0:21:9,67
