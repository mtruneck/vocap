###0 jess's apartments missing something rather curious about the banks recently
###4 of the head of their criminal division is labor or any drizzly
###8 told frontline and a documentary
###11 but in any given case i think
###13 uh... on in prosecutors around the country being responsible
###17 should speak to regulators she speak experts 'cause if i bring a case against
###21 institution a
###22 the result of bring that case to something
###25 there's some huge economic effectively creates a ripple effect so the subway
###29 counterparties and other financial institutions or other companies that had
###32 nothing to do with this are affected badly
###35 so factor we need to know and understand
###40 so in other words they are too big a jail
###43 uh... if i an expert comes it tim burger and tells me i hate look this will cause
###48 a ripple effect and it will hurt the global economy
###51 if you do the job
###53 and you're s
###54 bankers who are
###56 criminal fraud or criminal money laundry
###59 it as a test be seated
###62 uh... that could hurt the economy so back down do not do your job
###66 waitressing so
###67 hair colour with in for the senate judiciary committee yesterday may ask
###71 you about that the same eric holder who earlier was saying i can drop a drone on
###75 you for your regular citizen padhai trials truck stinkin trials i don't need
###80 i'm right
###81 and is executed
###82 but what does the bankers this is what he said is that
###85 i'm concerned that
###87 the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become
###92 difficult for us to uh... to prosecute them when we are hit with
###99 indications that give you prosecute if you do bring a criminal charge uh... it
###103 will have a negative impact when the national economy press given the world
###107 economy
###109 and i think that is a function of the fact that some of these institutions
###113 have become
###114 too large
###116 and mainstream
###117 in actual senate testimony isis
###120 well you have tended to large but what can we do so it'll hurt the global
###123 economy so we're not going to do our job
###126 get out of jail free card here you go use exactly like
###129 not only do we not prosecute for pass crimes weren't telling you right here in
###133 public
###134 we're not gonna prosecutor enterprise
###137 how bad i toss
###139 now do they feel same way about regular citizens was interesting 'cause
###143 their goal was also asked about their sports where they pursue the case
###146 against them
###148 he'd even violate the law
###150 they claim you buy a lady determine service contract in a private contract
###154 he had that he downloaded documents too fast
###157 you know he didn't even make them public
###159 spoke booked his name crime was downloading documents too fast
###164 they threatened in japan
###166 thirty five years in jail
###168 do you think that was appropriate to turn into older
###171 uh... doesn't try to use
###173 odd that the government would uh...
###176 indict someone for crimes
###179 that put carry penalties of up to thirty five years in prison
###182 and million dollar fines and then offer my three or four months
###186 prison sentence
###187 well i think that's a good good use of prosecutorial discretion to look at the
###191 the conduct
###192 regardless of what the statutory maximum sworn to fashion a sentence that was
###196 consistent with but what the nature of the the conduct was i think that what
###200 those prosecutors did in offering three four zero two six was consistent with
###205 with that conduct three don't consider this a case of prosecutorial re-try
###209 misconduct
###210 no i don't look at what necessarily was charged as much as what was offered in
###214 terms of um...
###215 how the case might have been resolved
###218 isn't that amazing
###221 no it was good prosecutorial discretion
###224 to charge a guy who didn't actually break the law
###227 with a possible thirty five-year sentence
###230 and at the same time on the same day he just said
###233 on wall prosecute
###235 any bankers
###237 remember hsbc did money-laundering for the mexican drug cartels needed money
###244 laundering for al-qaeda
###247 you got a lot of rock as well as your time bakery or free to go that is
###251 brilliant prosecutorial discretion but if you are every citizen
###255 a new download documents all too fast and we call you how active s
###259 all we need put you in jail for thirty five years
###262 ways as well we probably would have put him in for laughs well are you not
###265 merciful you see that right there is a perfect microcosm of what's wrong with
###270 our justice system because we don't have one
###274 is to polina consistent
###276 no justice for us
###279 and the bankers get what ever they want
###282 anarchic turned gel our top law enforcement officer goes out and tells
###287 the senators of this country i will not prosecute the buyers
