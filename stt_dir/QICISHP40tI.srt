1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:17,7



2
0:0:17,7 --> 0:0:22,21
I am always interested in
other people, and in how


3
0:0:22,21 --> 0:0:24,96
people think about
other people.


4
0:0:24,96 --> 0:0:27,71
So what I try to do in
photography is to play with


5
0:0:27,71 --> 0:0:28,89
these prejudices.


6
0:0:28,89 --> 0:0:32,83
I don't want to say to people,
you are wrong or your idea


7
0:0:32,83 --> 0:0:34,8
about other people is wrong.


8
0:0:34,8 --> 0:0:35,99
I also don't want to
say, you're right.


9
0:0:35,99 --> 0:0:38,3
But I just want people
to think about it.


10
0:0:38,3 --> 0:0:46,16



11
0:0:46,16 --> 0:0:48,22
My name is Rob Hornstra.


12
0:0:48,22 --> 0:0:51,52
I'm a photographer, but
I consider myself as a


13
0:0:51,52 --> 0:0:54,68
storyteller, a documentary
maker, slow journalism.


14
0:0:54,68 --> 0:0:57,61
It's not so much about
photography, but I use this


15
0:0:57,61 --> 0:1:1,33
medium to tell stories.


16
0:1:1,33 --> 0:1:5,0
I graduated in 2004, from the
Art Academy, and I'm working


17
0:1:5,0 --> 0:1:9,0
now, for seven years,
independent, on mostly long


18
0:1:9,0 --> 0:1:10,62
term projects.


19
0:1:10,62 --> 0:1:13,79
I'm from Holland, so here
we are in Utrecht.


20
0:1:13,79 --> 0:1:18,86
And from here, I'm going out to
other countries sometimes,


21
0:1:18,86 --> 0:1:22,95
Russia, Iceland, I hope
some more in the


22
0:1:22,95 --> 0:1:25,15
future, but not too many.


23
0:1:25,15 --> 0:1:28,21
I just don't feel that I'm the
type of person who will travel


24
0:1:28,21 --> 0:1:32,48
anywhere for one month just to
see a country, to meet the


25
0:1:32,48 --> 0:1:36,2
people over there, and get
a few shots or something.


26
0:1:36,2 --> 0:1:42,38
I want to go deeper and it has
its disadvantages because now


27
0:1:42,38 --> 0:1:46,6
many people call me the
Russia photographer.


28
0:1:46,6 --> 0:1:49,45
I'm convinced that I'm not
a Russia photographer.


29
0:1:49,45 --> 0:1:51,52
But I'm just focusing
for, maybe 10 or


30
0:1:51,52 --> 0:1:52,94
15 years, on Russia.


31
0:1:52,94 --> 0:1:56,34
So at the end of my life, people
will see that I also


32
0:1:56,34 --> 0:1:57,66
did other things.


33
0:1:57,66 --> 0:2:1,33
At least, I hope that I have
time left for that.


34
0:2:1,33 --> 0:2:2,81
This is, maybe, nice
to see because it's


35
0:2:2,81 --> 0:2:4,38
like the older series.


36
0:2:4,38 --> 0:2:6,83
This is my graduation project.


37
0:2:6,83 --> 0:2:10,38
I graduated in 2004
with a book,


38
0:2:10,38 --> 0:2:12,53
"Communism and Cowgirls".


39
0:2:12,53 --> 0:2:16,7
For one month, I went to
Russia and I focuses,


40
0:2:16,7 --> 0:2:20,44
particularly , on the younger
m the first generation who


41
0:2:20,44 --> 0:2:23,13
grew up after the fall
of Communism.


42
0:2:23,13 --> 0:2:27,4
The West became extremely
popular, like, Coca-Cola and


43
0:2:27,4 --> 0:2:29,83
Ramstein was extremely
popular.


44
0:2:29,83 --> 0:2:34,53
I didn't only photograph them,
but I also made photos of the


45
0:2:34,53 --> 0:2:36,11
places they're living in.


46
0:2:36,11 --> 0:2:39,73
But also, for example, of
their grandparents.


47
0:2:39,73 --> 0:2:43,79
This contrast was especially
fascinating to me.


48
0:2:43,79 --> 0:2:47,35
When I finished the art academy,
I was quite sure


49
0:2:47,35 --> 0:2:49,75
that, with the work I
made in Russia, I


50
0:2:49,75 --> 0:2:51,43
wanted to make a book.


51
0:2:51,43 --> 0:2:53,47
And of course, I couldn't
find a publisher.


52
0:2:53,47 --> 0:2:56,9
And then I started to
investigate how much it would


53
0:2:56,9 --> 0:2:59,89
cost to print this book, an
offset print, a real book.


54
0:2:59,89 --> 0:3:4,3
And it was seven and a half
thousand euro for 250 copies.


55
0:3:4,3 --> 0:3:6,43
And I was completely shocked.


56
0:3:6,43 --> 0:3:9,94
But on the other hand, I was
working as a bartender, and I


57
0:3:9,94 --> 0:3:12,56
explained this to
my colleagues.


58
0:3:12,56 --> 0:3:16,34
And then this colleague
immediately said, I want to


59
0:3:16,34 --> 0:3:21,25
buy a copy in advance, so here
you have 30 euro and maybe you


60
0:3:21,25 --> 0:3:22,7
could sell some more
copies in advance.


61
0:3:22,7 --> 0:3:24,85
And maybe it's possible.


62
0:3:24,85 --> 0:3:26,63
And it worked.


63
0:3:26,63 --> 0:3:29,5
The book sold out within
three, four months.


64
0:3:29,5 --> 0:3:30,69
So that's good.


65
0:3:30,69 --> 0:3:33,99
Got the money back and I
printed my first book.


66
0:3:33,99 --> 0:3:38,38
And as a result of this, at a
certain point, I was asked for


67
0:3:38,38 --> 0:3:40,5
a commission in Iceland.


68
0:3:40,5 --> 0:3:43,47
And I did a project over
there, also interested,


69
0:3:43,47 --> 0:3:46,33
especially, by the young
generation doing nothing in


70
0:3:46,33 --> 0:3:47,77
these villages.


71
0:3:47,77 --> 0:3:52,85
Then this Iceland book, I
started a new pre-sale, and it


72
0:3:52,85 --> 0:3:55,52
sold out within three days,
instead of three


73
0:3:55,52 --> 0:3:57,23
weeks or four weeks.


74
0:3:57,23 --> 0:3:59,32
So I did it again in 2008.


75
0:3:59,32 --> 0:4:4,56
My third book "101 Billionaires"
and what


76
0:4:4,56 --> 0:4:6,1
happened was that it
sold out within a


77
0:4:6,1 --> 0:4:8,92
few hours, this pre-sale.


78
0:4:8,92 --> 0:4:12,54
At that moment, Russia had 101
billionaires, and what I


79
0:4:12,54 --> 0:4:16,43
showed actually was the 99% of
the rest of the country.


80
0:4:16,43 --> 0:4:21,99



81
0:4:21,99 --> 0:4:27,44
Well, every morning I have to
do shift some books, the


82
0:4:27,44 --> 0:4:29,99
orders which come in.


83
0:4:29,99 --> 0:4:34,4
And it's not that difficult.


84
0:4:34,4 --> 0:4:35,91
That's it, actually.


85
0:4:35,91 --> 0:4:38,83
This is for today, so we'll
bring it to the post office.


86
0:4:38,83 --> 0:4:43,98



87
0:4:43,98 --> 0:4:46,37
The difficulty is, of course,
when you are self-published,


88
0:4:46,37 --> 0:4:49,17
is that you have to organize
everything by yourself.


89
0:4:49,17 --> 0:4:51,49
So you start with finding
a designer.


90
0:4:51,49 --> 0:4:54,66
You have to work with writers,
with a translator.


91
0:4:54,66 --> 0:4:57,57
You have to find a budget, you
have to find money, organize


92
0:4:57,57 --> 0:4:59,49
the payments, of course.


93
0:4:59,49 --> 0:5:3,27
And when you finish it, the
book is finally there.


94
0:5:3,27 --> 0:5:5,62
Then you also have to
ship all the books.


95
0:5:5,62 --> 0:5:8,49
So it's a lot of work.


96
0:5:8,49 --> 0:5:12,8
On the other hand, I believe
that if you publish the books


97
0:5:12,8 --> 0:5:15,69
yourself, you are completely
free in whatever you want to


98
0:5:15,69 --> 0:5:16,92
do with the book.


99
0:5:16,92 --> 0:5:20,2
The only thing I care about is
that I want to tell my story.


100
0:5:20,2 --> 0:5:23,11
I'll have to sell this book,
but it's really secondary.


101
0:5:23,11 --> 0:5:25,45
I want to make this book and I
believe that, if I tell the


102
0:5:25,45 --> 0:5:27,83
story in a perfect way, that
people will be interested.


103
0:5:27,83 --> 0:5:29,417
That's actually my only
idea behind it.


104
0:5:29,417 --> 0:5:35,76



105
0:5:35,76 --> 0:5:39,51
In 2008, right at the moment
that I published "101


106
0:5:39,51 --> 0:5:41,913
Billionaires", I was approached
by a writer, Arnold


107
0:5:41,913 --> 0:5:43,42
van Bruggen.


108
0:5:43,42 --> 0:5:45,7
I was already working with
him, also for "101


109
0:5:45,7 --> 0:5:46,72
Billionaires".


110
0:5:46,72 --> 0:5:51,7
And he told me about Olympic
Winter Games in Sochi.


111
0:5:51,7 --> 0:5:53,77
It was announced in 2007.


112
0:5:53,77 --> 0:5:57,58
And Arnold tried to convince me
to do a long term project


113
0:5:57,58 --> 0:6:0,45
about the region around Sochi.


114
0:6:0,45 --> 0:6:5,31
The goal of this project is to
document it for five years and


115
0:6:5,31 --> 0:6:9,24
to make an atlas of the region
in words and images.


116
0:6:9,24 --> 0:6:13,25
Sochi is over here, quite
far to the west and to


117
0:6:13,25 --> 0:6:15,7
the south, of course.


118
0:6:15,7 --> 0:6:17,49
And actually, what you see over
here is the whole Soviet


119
0:6:17,49 --> 0:6:23,56
Union, but partly, the lighter
brown is Russia.


120
0:6:23,56 --> 0:6:29,5
And Sochi is near the Black Sea,
so it's a holiday resort.


121
0:6:29,5 --> 0:6:32,31
And from Sochi, you go
straight up into the


122
0:6:32,31 --> 0:6:36,13
mountains, the Caucasus
Mountains, into the more or


123
0:6:36,13 --> 0:6:39,7
less troubled republics,
Chechnya, Dagestan,


124
0:6:39,7 --> 0:6:40,71
Ingushetia.


125
0:6:40,71 --> 0:6:45,33
It borders Georgia, borders
Abkhazia, also a conflict zone


126
0:6:45,33 --> 0:6:46,97
where a lot of things
go on right now.


127
0:6:46,97 --> 0:6:52,79



128
0:6:52,79 --> 0:6:57,6
So I just arrived last night
in Sochi, from Utrecht,


129
0:6:57,6 --> 0:6:59,33
Amsterdam, Moscow, Sochi.


130
0:6:59,33 --> 0:7:4,37
We're now on the 15th floor of
the Hotel Zhemchuzhina, which


131
0:7:4,37 --> 0:7:5,76
means the pearl.


132
0:7:5,76 --> 0:7:8,6
It's a hotel built in the
end the '90s, end


133
0:7:8,6 --> 0:7:9,5
of the Soviet times.


134
0:7:9,5 --> 0:7:11,81
And I think, actually, that the
view you have over here


135
0:7:11,81 --> 0:7:14,66
from Zhemchuzhina, is
one of the most


136
0:7:14,66 --> 0:7:17,296
brilliant views in Sochi.


137
0:7:17,296 --> 0:7:19,92
I took already many photos.


138
0:7:19,92 --> 0:7:23,56
What we, for example, want to
do is to show what kind of


139
0:7:23,56 --> 0:7:24,87
place Sochi is.


140
0:7:24,87 --> 0:7:29,65
And Sochi is really a tourist
resort, but maybe things are


141
0:7:29,65 --> 0:7:31,71
little bit different
than you expect.


142
0:7:31,71 --> 0:7:35,84
And this is also kind of an
aim or goal for me, within


143
0:7:35,84 --> 0:7:39,74
photography, to tell stories
which make people think and


144
0:7:39,74 --> 0:7:43,83
maybe they start to reconsider
their prejudice.


145
0:7:43,83 --> 0:7:48,5
What we tried to do is to
document this region to give a


146
0:7:48,5 --> 0:7:51,63
good view also because you can
be sure that, around these


147
0:7:51,63 --> 0:7:55,86
Olympic Games, there will be a
big facade from Russia to show


148
0:7:55,86 --> 0:8:0,56
how great and fantastic
everything is.


149
0:8:0,56 --> 0:8:2,66
We are, right now, at
the area where they


150
0:8:2,66 --> 0:8:4,86
built the Olympic stadiums.


151
0:8:4,86 --> 0:8:7,99
What we see over here is really
a journalistic picture,


152
0:8:7,99 --> 0:8:12,67
I think, because it's the new
stadiums and the old houses,


153
0:8:12,67 --> 0:8:15,8
all in one shot.


154
0:8:15,8 --> 0:8:17,45
I don't like this kind of
picture, by the way.


155
0:8:17,45 --> 0:8:20,81



156
0:8:20,81 --> 0:8:22,66
That's really what the
journalists like.


157
0:8:22,66 --> 0:8:24,33
It explains, actually,
the situation.


158
0:8:24,33 --> 0:8:26,97
But I do not really like
it for my work.


159
0:8:26,97 --> 0:8:28,7
It tells you too much.


160
0:8:28,7 --> 0:8:30,77
It's like exactly what it is.


161
0:8:30,77 --> 0:8:32,559
It doesn't leave anything
to your imagination.


162
0:8:32,559 --> 0:8:35,159



163
0:8:35,159 --> 0:8:39,89
Slow of journalism is a little
bit strange description of


164
0:8:39,89 --> 0:8:40,76
what we are doing.


165
0:8:40,76 --> 0:8:43,429
Actually, this term was
invented, I think, by someone


166
0:8:43,429 --> 0:8:44,53
in the Netherlands.


167
0:8:44,53 --> 0:8:48,53
And I believe slow journalism
is similar to documentary.


168
0:8:48,53 --> 0:8:52,51
And I believe, actually, that
the big difference is that


169
0:8:52,51 --> 0:8:57,1
journalism is focusing on what
is happening, and slow


170
0:8:57,1 --> 0:9:0,8
journalism is more why these
things are happening.


171
0:9:0,8 --> 0:9:33,126



172
0:9:33,126 --> 0:9:34,99
Now what's this?


173
0:9:34,99 --> 0:9:36,24
This food is really amazing.


174
0:9:36,24 --> 0:9:39,25



175
0:9:39,25 --> 0:9:41,445
What you see over here is what
will be the main stadium.


176
0:9:41,445 --> 0:9:53,52



177
0:9:53,52 --> 0:9:57,43
On the first of April, this
year, 2011, we started the


178
0:9:57,43 --> 0:9:59,95
third year of the
Sochi project.


179
0:9:59,95 --> 0:10:3,93
So at a certain point, I
came up with the idea--


180
0:10:3,93 --> 0:10:6,62
We were sitting in a restaurant
and there was a


181
0:10:6,62 --> 0:10:10,36
singer starting his show
again, which in the


182
0:10:10,36 --> 0:10:12,67
restaurant, in Sochi, always
means that you cannot talk


183
0:10:12,67 --> 0:10:14,34
with each other any more.


184
0:10:14,34 --> 0:10:17,25



185
0:10:17,25 --> 0:10:21,47
And this is actually a really
typical Russian cultural


186
0:10:21,47 --> 0:10:24,36
thing, but even more
typical for Sochi.


187
0:10:24,36 --> 0:10:29,8
So what I will do, in the
upcoming days in Sochi, is


188
0:10:29,8 --> 0:10:33,5
investigate if it can be a
good subject for a new


189
0:10:33,5 --> 0:10:34,75
publication.


190
0:10:34,75 --> 0:10:37,3



191
0:10:37,3 --> 0:10:40,975
Last night we went to a cafe
restaurant, [INAUDIBLE] which


192
0:10:40,975 --> 0:10:42,62
means South.


193
0:10:42,62 --> 0:10:45,7
And it looked like a very
interesting place, beautiful


194
0:10:45,7 --> 0:10:50,21
background, some interesting
details like a [INAUDIBLE]


195
0:10:50,21 --> 0:10:55,12
standing on the right, and there
was a nice toilet sign


196
0:10:55,12 --> 0:10:56,77
near the stage.


197
0:10:56,77 --> 0:10:59,87
So there must be a good
picture in it.


198
0:10:59,87 --> 0:11:2,38
I was happy with it.


199
0:11:2,38 --> 0:11:4,45
So when we started
this project we


200
0:11:4,45 --> 0:11:6,4
decided we need money.


201
0:11:6,4 --> 0:11:10,14
And we cannot rely on magazines
and newspapers, just


202
0:11:10,14 --> 0:11:13,66
the story everybody's telling.


203
0:11:13,66 --> 0:11:15,98
So we wanted to do something
different.


204
0:11:15,98 --> 0:11:18,66
And we looked to the U.S., and
what we saw over there was


205
0:11:18,66 --> 0:11:24,4
kickstarter.com and spot.us,
both crowd funding sites.


206
0:11:24,4 --> 0:11:28,44
And they were very interesting
to us because we didn't notice


207
0:11:28,44 --> 0:11:31,4
in the Netherlands and we were
almost sure that we didn't see


208
0:11:31,4 --> 0:11:32,97
it in Europe yet.


209
0:11:32,97 --> 0:11:38,7
So we tried to copy this model
from the U.S. Many people were


210
0:11:38,7 --> 0:11:42,42
interested in it and started
donating, not enough to do


211
0:11:42,42 --> 0:11:46,91
what we want to do, but it's a
really big amount of money.


212
0:11:46,91 --> 0:11:49,985
And we hope we can make
it for five years.


213
0:11:49,985 --> 0:11:55,2



214
0:11:55,2 --> 0:12:0,95
In 2009, we started by making
our first trip and we came to


215
0:12:0,95 --> 0:12:5,79
the idea to make a publication
about sanatoriums in Sochi.


216
0:12:5,79 --> 0:12:8,3
Sanatoriums are extremely
important and


217
0:12:8,3 --> 0:12:9,92
Russians like it a lot.


218
0:12:9,92 --> 0:12:14,34
We decided to stay there for
almost two weeks and to do


219
0:12:14,34 --> 0:12:16,46
exactly what Russians also do.


220
0:12:16,46 --> 0:12:19,42
You have to go in the mineral
bath, massage, and you get


221
0:12:19,42 --> 0:12:22,82
like an electric loaded clay
treatment and those kind of


222
0:12:22,82 --> 0:12:26,56
things, very interesting
to see for us.


223
0:12:26,56 --> 0:12:29,1
And then we heard that, because
of the Olympic games,


224
0:12:29,1 --> 0:12:33,1
they want to change them into
four or five star hotels.


225
0:12:33,1 --> 0:12:35,29
And that's the reason why we
decided to make the first


226
0:12:35,29 --> 0:12:39,35
publication about sanatoriums
because that's the only way we


227
0:12:39,35 --> 0:12:41,72
can preserve this history.


228
0:12:41,72 --> 0:12:50,36
There are only a few boxes left
with the last really big


229
0:12:50,36 --> 0:12:54,76
book, Empty Land
or [INAUDIBLE].


230
0:12:54,76 --> 0:12:58,33
We were already working, at that
time, for four years in


231
0:12:58,33 --> 0:13:2,28
the neighboring country of
Abkhazia which is really


232
0:13:2,28 --> 0:13:5,59
neighboring the Olympic
stadiums within five


233
0:13:5,59 --> 0:13:7,64
kilometers, so it's
walking distance.


234
0:13:7,64 --> 0:13:10,15
So the second year, we made
a book completely about


235
0:13:10,15 --> 0:13:14,49
Abkhazia, and it's a very
complicated story over there.


236
0:13:14,49 --> 0:13:16,88
Actually, this country is
isolated because it's not


237
0:13:16,88 --> 0:13:20,58
recognized by any country
in the world until 2008.


238
0:13:20,58 --> 0:13:23,2
Russia decided to recognize
Abkhazia as


239
0:13:23,2 --> 0:13:25,21
an independent country.


240
0:13:25,21 --> 0:13:28,15
it's an extremely complicated
story, so in the end, it also


241
0:13:28,15 --> 0:13:30,37
became an extremely book.


242
0:13:30,37 --> 0:13:32,31
It's a big historical,
political


243
0:13:32,31 --> 0:13:34,77
document about this region.


244
0:13:34,77 --> 0:13:42,26



245
0:13:42,26 --> 0:13:45,17
We are in a hurry tonight,
because I actually want to do


246
0:13:45,17 --> 0:13:46,56
five restaurants.


247
0:13:46,56 --> 0:13:49,19
That's quite a lot, but
they are very close.


248
0:13:49,19 --> 0:13:53,63
We're now in the center of Sochi
and hope to do five.


249
0:13:53,63 --> 0:13:55,83
So we have to hurry.


250
0:13:55,83 --> 0:13:59,63
What we realized immediately is
that we cannot make such a


251
0:13:59,63 --> 0:14:4,765
big document as we did in
Abkhazia, within a few months.


252
0:14:4,765 --> 0:14:7,15
We worked on this
for four years.


253
0:14:7,15 --> 0:14:12,11
So our idea came to do a
more simple subject.


254
0:14:12,11 --> 0:14:15,8
We cannot do such a big book,
but we can do these Sochi


255
0:14:15,8 --> 0:14:19,56
singers, the lounge singers.


256
0:14:19,56 --> 0:14:26,8
That will be, probably, our
new publication in 2011.


257
0:14:26,8 --> 0:14:28,86
I'm making a series about
musicians in restaurants.


258
0:14:28,86 --> 0:14:32,16
And the most beautiful is, if I
have a big interior, well, I


259
0:14:32,16 --> 0:14:35,69
will have it over here, and if
you sing like you do, what you


260
0:14:35,69 --> 0:14:39,1
also normally do, so don't pay
too much attention to me.


261
0:14:39,1 --> 0:14:42,62
Sometimes look at the camera,
and then, finally, it will be


262
0:14:42,62 --> 0:14:43,87
a brilliant picture.


263
0:14:43,87 --> 0:14:49,4



264
0:14:49,4 --> 0:14:55,18
And in 2013, we will probably
make our end book a really big


265
0:14:55,18 --> 0:14:57,65
book and what he call
the atlas about


266
0:14:57,65 --> 0:14:59,22
the region of Sochi.


267
0:14:59,22 --> 0:15:4,16
This will be combined with a
really big exhibition in, we


268
0:15:4,16 --> 0:15:7,325
hope, many places in Europe,
around the Olympic Games.


269
0:15:7,325 --> 0:15:17,89



270
0:15:17,89 --> 0:15:20,19
Well, I think I will be here
earlier before the Olympics.


271
0:15:20,19 --> 0:15:23,71



272
0:15:23,71 --> 0:15:28,2
But actually what we do, we also
try to present projects


273
0:15:28,2 --> 0:15:30,61
in different ways.


274
0:15:30,61 --> 0:15:33,44
We don't have to think about
these newspapers and


275
0:15:33,44 --> 0:15:34,65
magazines any more.


276
0:15:34,65 --> 0:15:37,78
We don't have to think about all
traditional ways to tell a


277
0:15:37,78 --> 0:15:40,88
story, especially, because
I'm self published.


278
0:15:40,88 --> 0:15:42,54
And there are many
self publishers.


279
0:15:42,54 --> 0:15:46,13
You don't have to think in a
way that documentary makers


280
0:15:46,13 --> 0:15:48,7
did it 20 years ago.


281
0:15:48,7 --> 0:15:51,17
We can do, actually, anything,
because nobody tells us,


282
0:15:51,17 --> 0:15:53,52
nobody tells us what
to do, actually,


283
0:15:53,52 --> 0:15:55,45
so we can do anything.


284
0:15:55,45 --> 0:15:56,7
And that's really good
about these times.


285
0:15:56,7 --> 0:17:56,7
