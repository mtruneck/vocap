###0 DAN: The fact that we're all friends, and we've sort of
###3 formulated a way to coexist so nicely.
###7 So that's what makes the clubhouse.
###8 It's fun.
###9 We've sort of got our little schedule thing going.
###12 We all know when everybody's starting to get hungry.
###15 We give each other the eye a little bit.
###17 Craig.
###18 Get out the menu book.
###20 We want four veal cutlet heros.
###24 We're going to see what one of these seafood
###25 salads is all about.
###28 STEVE: Craig is our shop assistant at Smith Street.
###31 Craig's sort of a little different from the rest of us.
###33 Craig's very dark, and he's very quiet and sort of morose
###37 and listens to really fucked up dark music.
###39 Craig does everything.
###41 We make Craig do everything.
###43 We can abuse him, and he will not flinch.
###47 DAN: Plus we all need to eat immediately.
###50 All these other guys will tell him, that light bulb's out.
###52 This needs to be dusted.
###53 I'm like, yo, I need that bagel order.
###56 He has no interest in food.
###58 He says that if there was a pill that could sustain his
###61 life, he would just swallow that pill and never eat.
###65 Doesn't like food.
###66 It's the strangest-- it's disturbing.
###70 CRAIG: Can I get three veal cutlet heros?
###73 And can I have sides of mayo for all those?
###75 Yeah, I don't really like eating.
###77 I don't really find any enjoyment in eating.
###82 I'm not a foodie by any means.
###84 DAN: A real dinner usually ensues.
###87 We still do the massage table family style.
###91 We do what we call Tuscan dining, and Craig waits on us.
###97 
###101 Hey Craig, are there any IPAs or anything
###106 there in the fridge?
###108 Craig, come look at your worst nightmare over here.
###112 One time, when Craig was a little boy, and he was
###114 swimming in the ocean, one of the fish brushed
###117 up against his leg.
###118 And he's never eaten a piece of seafood since.
###120 See, if that was me, it would be my mission to eat all the
###123 eels in the world after that.
###125 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###126 
###130 ELLI: We definitely enjoy busting each other's chops.
###133 Dan and Craig have a lot of squabbles at the shop.
###136 I think he likes to blame Craig for a lot of stuff.
###140 And I think that's when you know he's flustered, is when
###142 he starts yelling at Craig.
###144 DAN: Because he gets snippy.
###145 He does like the whole, get it yourself, thing.
###147 Even though he'll always get it.
###149 He'll just say get it yourself.
###150 And some days I think it's the funniest thing ever.
###153 And some days I'm like, you know
###154 what, Craig, fuck yourself.
###155 Get it right now.
###157 STEVE: It makes him the perfect floor guy.
###158 Because you can just give him so much shit, and he just lets
###160 it roll right off his back.
###161 And it'll be very hard to replace Craig.
###163 Craig is a great shop assistant.
###166 I think as shop assistants go, I feel like a lot of shops
###169 make their assistants do nothing.
###171 And I'm like, what the fuck are you getting paid for?
###173 DAN: Most floor guys are bumbling.
###175 If someone comes up to the counter, and is like, how much
###177 for this tattoo?
###178 And they're like, [STAMMERING].
###180 They don't even know what to say.
###181 They're like, uh.
###182 They get all nervous and shit.
###183 Whereas Craig's like cool, calm.
###185 He's like the minimum is $100.
###188 He just handles it every time.
###190 I met Craig for the first time at a Pratt party.
###195 He was visiting from Buffalo.
###198 Craig has a decent amount of my tattooing.
###200 When he first started visiting me in New Jersey, he'd always
###203 bring me these biblical engravings, like Saint Peter
###211 being crucified upside down.
###213 There's this old wood cut, kind of thing, of old scribe
###217 drawing in a book.
###219 And the book said something about hate humanity, something
###224 or another, real misanthropic stuff.
###226 So when he first started getting tattooed by me, he
###229 just wanted these real metal style biblical engravings.
###235 So he's got a lot of that stuff on his forearms.
###238 And then he started to realize that you can make a tattoo
###242 look like a tattoo, but it can still be brutal.
###246 That's when I started doing some of the
###248 bigger stuff on him.
###249 We did the back piece.
###250 The back piece is a depiction of Snakeland, which are these
###255 abandoned grain silos in Buffalo.
###257 It's kind of a metal icon.
###259 And there's a lot of satanic stuff.
###262 And luckily Craig lived right down the street.
###265 He grew up in there.
###265 He crucified a deer in the place.
###269 The deer was dead.
###270 But he crucified a deer, among some other things.
###274 So Craig needed to have that on his back, as sort of an
###279 homage to his childhood, and to Satan.
###284 Craig's not a killer.
###285 He's not a murderer.
###287 He's just a fucking weirdo.
###289 Yeah, he's just bad.
###290
