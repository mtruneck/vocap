###26 TOM SACHS: My name is Tom Sachs.
###28 I'm 45 years old.
###29 This is my Space Program.
###32 Scientists will be analyzing Mars soil samples, determining
###36 whether it's safe to inseminate the Mars surface.
###38 
###51 VAN NEISTAT: The same energy and the same skill that NASA,
###56 the other NASA, used to get their people to the moon, we
###60 are using here.
###62 And we're using all the money we can get our hands on.
###64 We're using all the hours we can get out of ourselves, all
###68 of our brain power, all of the research, to
###71 accomplish this mission.
###72 And in that respect, we are going to Mars.
###76 LT SAM RATANARAT: There's a real buzz in the studio.
###78 And everyone's always working on something different.
###80 And if people are helping each other, and there's always
###82 people coming in for studio visits.
###84 And it's just kind of--
###85 it's really alive, and it's really great.
###87 It's the best job I've ever had.
###89 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###97 TOM SACHS: The space program ended in October with the
###99 closure of the shuttle program.
###100 It's clear that companies like SpaceX, Elon Musk's private
###106 thing, or Richard Branson or the Google guys, everyone's
###110 got their own space program now.
###112 And that's where the money's at.
###115 And I think that my space program has as much teeth as
###120 theirs do because mine wins hearts and minds.
###122 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###137 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Three, two, one, main engine
###140 start, zero, and lift off of the Atlas V with Curiosity,
###147 seeking clues to the planetary puzzle about life on Mars.
###151 TOM SACHS: The Mars Science Laboratory, MSL, Curiosity's
###156 landing on Mars on August 4 is the greatest scientific
###160 machine we've ever created.
###161 It's a fantastic rover that has a mass spectroscopy
###167 machine, laser emulation, great cameras.
###169 And a rover, it runs on like a nuclear-power battery.
###172 It's the most miraculous thing.
###173 But you might not even know about it.
###176 And your viewers might not know about it because it
###178 doesn't have any people on it.
###180 And, as sexual, reproducing beings, it's important that we
###186 go to other planets to encourage people.
###189 I mean, when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon, you
###192 imagined yourself in his shoes.
###193 When that robot does laser emulation, it's really hard
###196 for you to even imagine what that idea is.
###198 
###201 I think we have to go to Mars.
###203 It's an important place to go from a scientific perspective.
###208 If you want to look at the big question--
###211 where did we come from?
###213 Mars has evidence of that there used to be water there.
###217 If you took one semester of sedimentology in college, you
###221 will believe that water was there, if you just study the
###223 facts, the pictures, and understand how
###226 water erodes rock.
###228 And why is that important?
###230 Well, wherever there was water, there was life.
###235 GORDON MILLSAPS: This is the only--
###236 not even NASA has like a completely freestanding LEM
###241 module like this, aside from the ones that are on the moon.
###243 
###246 What we've got in here is everything that the two
###248 astronauts will need for the full mission, and then some.
###252 Everything from--
###253 I mean, we might put a little more emphasis on vibe than the
###256 normal space program because we have the DJ mixer over here
###260 with the CD player and an iPod dock.
###262 We have the tequila, vodka, and whiskey bar, including
###268 blunt pumps running through our own homemade dispensers.
###272 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Seven, six, five,
###276 four, three, two, one.
###280 Lift off.
###281 
###287 VAN NEISTAT: That's like the master.
###290 And then you have all of the different cameras that are
###292 spaced out.
###293 So this is a chronological order of the things that are
###296 going to happen.
###298 Right?
###299 So this is where you suit up, in the quarantine, this is
###302 where the astronauts will suit up.
###305 And then, eventually, we get to the launch
###308 pad is right there.
###309 That's the rockets, et cetera, et cetera.
###311 And what this is basically a time line of the mission.
###317 GORDON MILLSAPS: What I've learned
###318 about the space program--
###320 partly through our own work, but also through our
###322 partnership with the folks at Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
###325 with whom we've had a bit of a back and forth think tank over
###328 the past two years-- where they fly over to us, drink
###330 tequila, and talk about art.
###331 We fly over to them, drink vodka, and talk about science.
###336 It's really that it's just some dudes
###338 in a glorified garage.
###340 When they come over to our studio, and we talk about the
###342 steering on the rover, where we took a golf
###345 cart, cut it in half.
###347 And the winch, mounted it to the steering so that you could
###350 have push-button steering in your right hand.
###354 We all sat around and just kind of fucked around with
###356 ideas with our buddies from JPL.
###359 And then we were like, man, how did you put those airbags
###362 on the Pathfinder mission to Mars?
###363 And he was like, I don't know.
###364 We just tried some stuff, just like we're doing now.
###366 And once it stopped popping, we thought it might work.
###368 So we kind of realized there's a greater affinity between the
###372 work that we have and their work than we'd
###374 ever thought before.
###375 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###385 GORDON MILLSAPS: This isn't just plywood and some artists,
###388 like, trying to tell you that we're definitely going to Mars
###392 on the Park Avenue Armory.
###393 Like, we're actually dealing with our friends at NASA and
###396 Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
###397 We're actually figuring out real systems and talking about
###400 existing systems.
###401 And it's our hope that some of that little stoke, little bit
###404 of excitement-- if one five-year-old comes out of
###407 here with an idea that sticks with him for a few years, long
###409 enough to get him to go and study things a little bit
###411 deeper, every little bit of it's worth it.
###414 TOM SACHS: I think what I've learned from NASA is stay out
###418 of headquarters.
###419 Don't ask permission from government.
###421 Do it yourself because they will only mire you in
###424 bureaucracy.
###425 They will crush your spirit.
###430 Don't get a motorcycle license.
###432 That's what I learned.
###434 Ride safe, but don't get involved in the system.
