###6 PATRICK O'DELL: What videos do you have that you're in?
###8 I can see one of them?
###10 JERRY HSU: I can't believe you're making me watch this.
###13 Wait, this is a trick that I worked on for weeks, like
###17 weeks nonstop trying to learn it.
###19 PATRICK O'DELL: Dude, you have the hugest pants.
###22 JERRY HSU: I know, it's funny because I wanted them bigger.
###25 Because that was what skaters did, and I just wanted to look
###29 like skaters.
###31 Like skaters looked so retarded when I started
###34 skating, and I wanted to look like that.
###37 
###41 PATRICK O'DELL: What is this so torturous for you?
###43 JERRY HSU: I don't know.
###45 PATRICK O'DELL: I mean, is it from watching yourself state?
###49 JERRY HSU: I don't think I'd like it.
###51 PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, welcome back to the
###52 "Epicly Later'd" show.
###53 This episode is about Jerry Hsu.
###56 I went on a little trip to San Jose, met up with Jerry.
###59 He just took me around in his car, we went to some of the
###62 spots where he learned how to skate.
###64 Jerry, since the first time he started skating it seems, was
###67 a total child prodigy.
###70 At 13, it seems like he was as good as most pro skaters.
###73 He also entrusted me with a VHS tape of all his home skate
###78 videos from when he was 13.
###80 Anyway, this is the Jerry Hsu episode and I
###83 hope you enjoy it.
###84 JERRY HSU: So basically now we've entered the hotbed, the
###88 one mile radius of the house I grew up in.
###92 So this is basically where I did all of my skating.
###97 It's right there.
###99 Oh, dude, they knobbed it.
###101 
###104 PATRICK O'DELL: Your first handrail?
###106 JERRY HSU: Yeah.
###107 
###109 Probably slid like here to here, did a no slide.
###114 PATRICK O'DELL: That was your first handrail trick?
###116 JERRY HSU: Yeah.
###119 PATRICK O'DELL: Because of you they put a knob on it.
###120 JERRY HSU: Yeah, I hadn't really been
###122 skating that long--
###124 just like three or four years.
###125 MARC JOHNSON: Did he show you the footage of him skating in
###127 his garage?
###128 JERRY HSU: Filmed it himself?
###129 MARC JOHNSON: Yeah, like just doing [INAUDIBLE]
###132 around his garage.
###132 Like him just going back and forth, doing really hard
###136 tricks for back then and stuff.
###138 PATRICK O'DELL: Did you just set the camera up?
###139 JERRY HSU: Yeah, I'm just setting the camera up and
###141 filming myself because I wanted to know what everything
###144 looked like.
###145 I just wanted to know what skating looked like.
###148 I wanted everything in my life to revolve around skating.
###153 So this is where my parents live.
###155 
###159 And this is where I started skating--
###163 and there's my parking block.
###166 My mom figured out that skaters liked the skate
###169 parking blocks.
###170 One day after work she went to a construction site or
###174 something and bought one and brought it
###176 home for me to skate.
###179 Hello?
###181 Hey, dad.
###181 CHING HSU: Hi.
###182 JERRY HSU: Dad, he's filming me for a little internet show.
###185 CHING HSU: OK, cool.
###186 JERRY HSU: Yeah, is mom around, too?
###189 CHING HSU: Yeah.
###189 JERRY HSU: Hi, mom.
###191 SU HSU: Oh, he's going to interview me?
###193 JERRY HSU: Yeah, is that OK?
###194 SU HSU: Oh, OK.
###196 PATRICK O'DELL: When he was young did you ever worry he
###197 was going to get hurt or anything like that?
###199 SU HSU: Sure.
###201 Which mother doesn't?
###203 PATRICK O'DELL: Did you want him to go to college?
###206 SU HSU: Sure.
###207 That's probably every parent's first choice.
###211 Well, I'm happy for him as I said.
###213 This is his job, not mine, and it's his life, not mine.
###218 MARC JOHNSON: It's traditional Chinese, like comes from a
###221 traditional Chinese family.
###223 And it's just the cultures are different and he just chose a
###227 different road and I don't think he'd have been happy
###230 being a computer programmer or something like that.
###233 I think he knew what he wanted to do, despite
###236 what anybody said.
###238 He just kept doing it.
###240 
###244 JERRY HSU: Are you waiting for me to speak Chinese?
###246 PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.
###247 
###252 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###257 JERRY HSU: I got caught shoplifting here
###259 when I was like 13.
###262 And they called the cops and the cops took me home.
###265 And my grandpa was there and he didn't speak English.
###268 And the cops dropped me off, and my grandpa
###274 was freaking out.
###275 And he thought I got arrested, which I kind of did.
###277 But I totally lied to him in Chinese and told him that I
###281 got lost and the cops just brought me home.
###285 PATRICK O'DELL: What did you steal?
###288 JERRY HSU: This is pretty funny, but I tried to steal my
###290 own photos.
###292 PATRICK O'DELL: What were they photos of?
###294 JERRY HSU: Probably just me and my friend skating.
###296 
###299 This is like my first line spot.
###302 We would come here after school and hang out with this
###304 guy who worked here.
###307 And he was like an older guy who claimed to be a pro skater
###313 in the '80s, but we totally believed him because we were
###316 just like 12.
###317 So it was so impressive to us that we believed anything he
###321 said, but really he was kind of just like a liar.
###324 MATT EVERSOLE: [INAUDIBLE]
###325 me and his brother went to play basketball down the
###328 street from his house.
###330 And there was these two kids skating and they came over and
###333 said hello, and it was Jerry and his friend Will.
###336 He was just like some dorky little kid.
###338 He was wearing these Dickies and they were blown out ass.
###341 And he was just going for it--
###343 hucking his body off of the deck, 360 flip, and just
###346 eating shit.
###347 And we were all like oh my God, this kid wants it.
###349 But it was pretty incredible.
###351 JERRY HSU: These are like some stairs I ollied once.
###354 These are actually stairs that we skated like
###356 every single day.
###357 And we'd try to do every single trick that we possibly
###360 knew how to do down them.
###361 And we would just like throw ourselves down
###363 these little stairs.
###364 One of the myths that we heard when we were little kids is a
###368 skater ollied from the stairs to the street, which is
###375 basically impossible--
###376 I don't like anyone could do it.
###380 But we would try and ollie, like long jump, we would try
###385 and ollie as far as we could to try and eventually get to
###388 the street.
###391 I made it to here.
###393 MATT EVERSOLE: Darkslides, he did darkslides back then.
###395 PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah, I couldn't believe
###396 that, I was like what?
###397 MATT EVERSOLE: A kid in middle school doing darkslides.
###399 PATRICK O'DELL: And landing them.
###400 I could see him getting into them.
###402 MATT EVERSOLE: Oh yeah, I just watched him
###404 just grow into himself.
###407 Like he found a uniqueness like
###410 unmistakable Jerry, you know?
###412 FEMALE SPEAKER: Quiet down everyone.
###414 We have a new student today in class, his name is Jerry Hsu.
###417 OK, Jerry, why don't you tell the class a
###418 little bit about yourself?
###420 JERRY HSU: My name's Jerry Hsu, and I'm 14-years-old and
###424 I live in San Jose.
###427 Sorry, it's just like I'm watching this and
###429 it's kind of crazy.
###430 It's like every video part that I make, I want it to be
###434 the best I could possibly do.
###437 Of course it never really ends up being like that, but
###439 definitely every time I start a new project, I just want it
###444 to be really good.
###445 I think it's just wanting to be good at something, and to
###448 get better at it.
###449 And then when you don't want to do that, then
###450 you stop doing it.
###452 Oh, this kid?
###453 He tried to pickpocket me in Moscow and I caught him.
###456 And then he swung around and did a karate kick,
###460 but he missed me.
###462 He was like a gypsy kid.
###465 His whole family were gypsies and they're all trying to rob
###467 us by creating diversions.
###468 Like his sisters were all doing cartwheels in front of
###471 us, and then all the brothers were behind us trying to
###473 pickpocket us.
###474 And their dad was walking alongside of us, supervising
###478 the robbery.
###480 
###483 This is a photo of my friend Louie.
###486 We're just riding mopeds in Cambodia.
###491 That's the only country I've ever been to that doesn't have
###494 a McDonald's in it.
###495 But it's crazy, it's one of those countries with like
###499 naked babies walking around, and people with no arms, and
###504 people with machine guns just walking around--
###507 it's pretty fucked up.
###507 But yeah, we went to a gun range.
###509 And for $20 you could shoot AKs and throw grenades.
###513 And for a little more money, you can bring a cow there and
###520 throw a grenade at it and just watch it blow up.
###524 This was in Moscow, and this guy was just wasted and
###529 couldn't stand up.
###530 And then we were all watching him and then he just tipped
###535 over like a tree falling over.
###537 And he fell, like his head right on the curb, there's
###540 blood was everywhere.
###541 And everyone walking around was just ignoring him, like it
###545 wasn't even happening.
###546 This is kind of like a gem.
###550 This is me, I used to play Rambo when I was a kid.
###555 I seriously have no filing system, it's so disorganized
###561 and kind of embarrassing.
###565 This is my drawer of sketchy photos.
###567 PATRICK O'DELL: That's hidden?
###568 JERRY HSU: But you probably can't film it.
###570 
###573 PATRICK O'DELL: I see that you spend a
###575 lot of money on framing.
###577 JERRY HSU: Yeah, I take really good care of them, too.
###580 I like to collect masks.
###582 I got it in Japan, and the name of it was Hollywood Girl.
###589 MATT EVERSOLE: The way that Jerry lives his life is like
###591 he lives it on his own terms.
###592 He wears what he wants to wear, he sleeps
###594 when he wants to sleep.
###595 He does whatever he wants to do.
###598 And when you're in a business situation, they either don't
###602 like that because they can't do that, or they don't like
###605 that because it's not marketable or whatever.
###607 He's kind of like an old soul, like he's way ahead
###610 of people up here.
###612 He's the guy that's younger than you and
###614 you look up to him.
###616 JERRY HSU: This is kind of like the rec room.
###619 
###622 PATRICK O'DELL: Dirt floors?
###624 JERRY HSU: Yeah, this is probably the
###625 coolest room in my house.
###627 PATRICK O'DELL: Are you going to build a well?
###629 JERRY HSU: Yeah.
###629 I started, but it's underneath that piece of plywood.
###632 And it's not done yet, so I don't really
###634 want to ruin the surprise.
###636 PATRICK O'DELL: Are there any chicks down there?
###639 JERRY HSU: Not yet, but hopefully soon.
###643 
###645 Whoa, look at this one.
###647 PATRICK O'DELL: Oh shit, that's
###648 worth money right there.
###650 JERRY HSU: It's like one of the best skate
###653 videos probably ever.
###655 PATRICK O'DELL: What do you consider the job of being a
###658 pro skater?
###658 Like, what are the things that you're supposed to do?
###662 JERRY HSU: Well, I guess the main thing you have to do is
###665 be good at skateboarding.
###667 It's funny, because there's nothing involved and there's a
###670 lot involved.
###671 You can be really, really good, but no
###673 one will give a shit.
###674 There are amazing skaters who are really
###676 unsuccessful as pro skaters.
###679 It's crazy, there's a lot of discrimination in skating.
###683 But also it kind of makes sense, because they want the
###686 people that endorse their shit to be interesting and they
###689 want people to like them and stuff.
###692 I don't know, ask me another question.
###695 PATRICK O'DELL: Oh, this photo is pretty controversial.
###698 JERRY HSU: Yeah?
###699 PATRICK O'DELL: What was the deal with that?
###701 JERRY HSU: That's my friend Tim's cat.
###703 I just, I don't know.
###705 Nothing's happening there, I'm like really close to the cat,
###709 but I'm not touching it.
###710 That photo ended up on a porno website, too.
###715 It was like a porno website, one of those sites like has
###720 just shocking photos of things that your friends email you.
###724 Some guy just sent me a link to that.
###725 And it was on some sketchy website with chicks with dicks
###729 and guys' dicks tied in knots and things like that.
###733
