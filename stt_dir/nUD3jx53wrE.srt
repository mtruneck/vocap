StoryTime with Brett Ratner,
and adventures in BabyMan.

RYAN DUFFY: Hey, I'm Ryan Duffy,
and welcome to another


6
0:0:11,11 --> 0:0:12,52
episode of Vice Today.


7
0:0:12,52 --> 0:0:14,75
On today's installment, we hear
from Brett Ratner in a


8
0:0:14,75 --> 0:0:17,15
segment called StoryTime, where
he tells us about the


9
0:0:17,15 --> 0:0:18,77
best party he's ever thrown.


10
0:0:18,77 --> 0:0:21,45
Then we put Justin, a weird,
little, child man who we like


11
0:0:21,45 --> 0:0:24,73
a lot, in some really new and
uncomfortable situations.


12
0:0:24,73 --> 0:0:26,97
But first up, we have another
episode of What's Up With


13
0:0:26,97 --> 0:0:29,51
Drake, where you learn about
your favorite rapper from a


14
0:0:29,51 --> 0:0:30,4
nerd with a monotone


15
0:0:30,4 --> 0:0:34,63
[MUSIC PLAYING]


16
0:0:34,63 --> 0:0:35,96
HANSON O'HAVER: Hey,
I'm Hanson O'Haver.


17
0:0:35,96 --> 0:0:41,8
So Drake premiered two videos
this week, one for "HYFR" and


18
0:0:41,8 --> 0:0:43,79
one for "Take Care." I think
that we should talk about


19
0:0:43,79 --> 0:0:45,75
"Take Care" first, just
because it's the least


20
0:0:45,75 --> 0:0:47,89
interesting of the two.


21
0:0:47,89 --> 0:0:51,52
The video was directed by the
guy who directed the video


22
0:0:51,52 --> 0:0:53,76
where Lana Del Rey dies
in a car crash.


23
0:0:53,76 --> 0:0:57,67
But for this one, in lieu of
a shirtless, kind of like


24
0:0:57,67 --> 0:1:1,2
face-tatted alt-bro,
there's Rihanna.


25
0:1:1,2 --> 0:1:3,68
Both videos feature
wild animals.


26
0:1:3,68 --> 0:1:6,34
I think in Drake's, there's like
some sort of eagle, and


27
0:1:6,34 --> 0:1:9,56
then what looks like
a water buffalo.


28
0:1:9,56 --> 0:1:13,29
So the video is mostly Rihanna
and Drake hugging with kind of


29
0:1:13,29 --> 0:1:15,11
like an English look
on their face.


30
0:1:15,11 --> 0:1:17,9
There's also some slow-mo
nature shots.


31
0:1:17,9 --> 0:1:20,71
But for the most part, it's
all just in a gray room.


32
0:1:20,71 --> 0:1:23,53
The director described the video
as humble, but I think


33
0:1:23,53 --> 0:1:25,26
really it's just generic.


34
0:1:25,26 --> 0:1:29,18
It's sort of like when you go to
a art gallery, between the


35
0:1:29,18 --> 0:1:32,4
really great pieces, like the
masterworks, there's just kind


36
0:1:32,4 --> 0:1:34,7
of filler stuff so that
there's enough


37
0:1:34,7 --> 0:1:35,66
to make an art show.


38
0:1:35,66 --> 0:1:39,98
Like it's really, instead of
being a meaningful rap video,


39
0:1:39,98 --> 0:1:43,17
it's like a simulacrum of
a meaningful rap video.


40
0:1:43,17 --> 0:1:47,81
So the "HYFR" video, it starts
with footage from Drake's


41
0:1:47,81 --> 0:1:51,365
actual Bar Mitzvah with a
13-year-old Drake dancing, and


42
0:1:51,365 --> 0:1:52,1
it's [BLEEP]


43
0:1:52,1 --> 0:1:53,92
adorable.


44
0:1:53,92 --> 0:1:57,23
And then the rest of the video
claims to be real footage of


45
0:1:57,23 --> 0:1:59,6
Drake's re-Bar Mitzvah.


46
0:1:59,6 --> 0:2:2,23
It basically shows Drake and
like his crew and some really


47
0:2:2,23 --> 0:2:4,26
pretty girls and like
some dorky, old,


48
0:2:4,26 --> 0:2:6,43
white men wilding out.


49
0:2:6,43 --> 0:2:9,4
At one point, Drake gets like
hoisted on a chair.


50
0:2:9,4 --> 0:2:10,99
A cake gets smashed.


51
0:2:10,99 --> 0:2:14,48
Also Lil' Wayne has a panda mask
and a skateboard, kind of


52
0:2:14,48 --> 0:2:19,0
solidifying his ascension to
cautionary tale status.


53
0:2:19,0 --> 0:2:21,97
The video is funny, it's
exciting, it's


54
0:2:21,97 --> 0:2:23,4
easily made into GIFs.


55
0:2:23,4 --> 0:2:26,89
It's really everything that a
rap video should be in 2012.


56
0:2:26,89 --> 0:2:29,68
I don't think the video is going
to do much to help solve


57
0:2:29,68 --> 0:2:31,54
the Israel-Palestine conflict.


58
0:2:31,54 --> 0:2:34,35
Like I don't think that Bibi
Netanyahu and the members of


59
0:2:34,35 --> 0:2:38,462
Fatah are going to watch it,
but it could only help.


60
0:2:38,462 --> 0:2:44,74
[MUSIC PLAYING]


61
0:2:44,74 --> 0:2:46,33
RYAN DUFFY: Every once in a
while, I wonder when I watch


62
0:2:46,33 --> 0:2:48,98
those if through the magic of
the internet, Drake somehow


63
0:2:48,98 --> 0:2:53,79
sees them and watches it, and
just goes, what the [BLEEP]?


64
0:2:53,79 --> 0:2:55,4
Our next segment is
called StoryTime.


65
0:2:55,4 --> 0:2:56,89
And we're going to be making
a bunch of them.


66
0:2:56,89 --> 0:2:59,36
Basically, we just visit with
people and ask about the best


67
0:2:59,36 --> 0:3:1,16
story they can possibly
tell us.


68
0:3:1,16 --> 0:3:3,93
In the first episode, Brett
Ratner tells us how he played


69
0:3:3,93 --> 0:3:5,7
matchmaker for Charlie Sheen.


70
0:3:5,7 --> 0:3:13,43
[MUSIC PLAYING]


71
0:3:13,43 --> 0:3:16,42
BRETT RATNER: I think the best
party I've ever been to is a


72
0:3:16,42 --> 0:3:19,97
party that I had that was--


73
0:3:19,97 --> 0:3:21,68
happened just by chance.


74
0:3:21,68 --> 0:3:24,11
And it was probably the luckiest
day in my life.


75
0:3:24,11 --> 0:3:27,26
I get a call from the head
of Victoria's Secret.


76
0:3:27,26 --> 0:3:30,0
And he says, we've never had a
party in Los Angeles, and we'd


77
0:3:30,0 --> 0:3:33,14
like you to host a party
for Victoria's


78
0:3:33,14 --> 0:3:34,65
Secret at your home.


79
0:3:34,65 --> 0:3:36,32
And I said, well, what
do you mean by that?


80
0:3:36,32 --> 0:3:40,12
And he goes, we will bring 25
supermodels to your home,


81
0:3:40,12 --> 0:3:41,0
Victoria Secret models.


82
0:3:41,0 --> 0:3:41,84
I said, are you joking?


83
0:3:41,84 --> 0:3:42,79
He said, no, we're serious.


84
0:3:42,79 --> 0:3:44,51
I go, who can I invite?


85
0:3:44,51 --> 0:3:45,27
He goes, whoever you want.


86
0:3:45,27 --> 0:3:46,79
I said, well I'm not inviting
many people.


87
0:3:46,79 --> 0:3:49,62
And I, literally, I think
invited 10 guys.


88
0:3:49,62 --> 0:4:1,7
[MUSIC PLAYING]


89
0:4:1,7 --> 0:4:3,25
BRETT RATNER: I have a disco
in my house that was


90
0:4:3,25 --> 0:4:4,77
built in the '70s.


91
0:4:4,77 --> 0:4:9,895
25 supermodels and 10
guys in my house.


92
0:4:9,895 --> 0:4:18,73
[MUSIC PLAYING]


93
0:4:18,73 --> 0:4:22,56
BRETT RATNER: Three of the 10
guys ended up marrying three


94
0:4:22,56 --> 0:4:23,55
of the girls.


95
0:4:23,55 --> 0:4:26,88
Adriana Lima married a
basketball player.


96
0:4:26,88 --> 0:4:29,35
Charlie Sheen happened to marry
the one girl that wasn't


97
0:4:29,35 --> 0:4:29,82
a Victoria Secret model.


98
0:4:29,82 --> 0:4:31,64
Happened to come with
my ex-girlfriend.


99
0:4:31,64 --> 0:4:34,73
And the third girl, Orlando
Bloom married.


100
0:4:34,73 --> 0:4:37,66
Three people at one party, and
there was only 10 guys there


101
0:4:37,66 --> 0:4:38,83
and 25 girls.


102
0:4:38,83 --> 0:4:39,94
That has never happened.


103
0:4:39,94 --> 0:4:42,42
It was the best party
I've ever been to.

105
0:4:46,11 --> 0:4:48,45
RYAN DUFFY: Finally, we have
Adventures in BabyMan.


106
0:4:48,45 --> 0:4:49,93
Justin's an editor
who works for us.


107
0:4:49,93 --> 0:4:51,87
We found him swaddled
in blankets on


108
0:4:51,87 --> 0:4:53,32
our front stoop crying.


109
0:4:53,32 --> 0:4:55,73
He's basically an overgrown
fetus, but we like him a lot.


110
0:4:55,73 --> 0:4:57,19
So we want to teach him
about the world.


111
0:4:57,19 --> 0:4:59,81
In this first episode, he learns
about yoga from our


112
0:4:59,81 --> 0:5:2,37
friend Clara in a romantic
setting at the waterfront.


113
0:5:2,37 --> 0:5:8,84

114
0:5:8,84 --> 0:5:9,42
CLARA: Hi, I'm Clara.


115
0:5:9,42 --> 0:5:12,44
And today I'm going to teach
BabyMan bird of paradise.


116
0:5:12,44 --> 0:5:13,23
BABYMAN: Hi.


117
0:5:13,23 --> 0:5:14,78
I'm BabyMan.

wants to see you get it


121

together today.
