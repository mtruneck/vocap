###2 shuttle going to uh...
###5 who are going to have on to do some post-debate analysis
###9 and uh... had no idea is until uh... we heard uh... this clip
###14 from uh... mit romney this clip number one
###17 and i said well gosh cant wait
###19 kelly find some some women that are also qualified
###22 and uh... and sweet we took a concerted effort to go out and find a women
###26 who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our
###29 cabinet
###30 i went to a number of women's groups and said can you help us find folks i
###33 brought us or a binders full of the of women i was proud of the fact that after
###38 i staffed by cabinet and my senior staff
###41 at the university orca in albany did a survey of all fifty states
###46 and concluded that mine had more women and seniors leadership positions than
###49 any of the state america
###51 now one of the reasons i was able to get somebody good women to be part of that
###54 team was because of our recruiting f yes it was their recording efforts and so i
###58 said to uh...
###60 matt binder who is our uh... one of our producers
###64 ringleader binder
###66 and uh... so we're gonna have digby on today but it turns out
###71 that this story
###73 allowed uh... mit romney
###76 not exactly true
###78 i'm just so shocked i don't even know on even though the say
###82 my
###83 uh...
###84 it turns out that you know mit romney didn't turn to is
###88 his pals once he got an opposite break binder love women
###93 so that i may hire more women no in fact
###98 according to david bernstein riding in the uh... phoenix
###102 what actually happened was that in two thousand two prior to the election not
###105 even know yet whether would-be republican or democratic administration
###109 a bipartisan group of women in massachusetts
###111 formed a mask at to address the problem a few women and senior leadership
###115 positions in state government
###118 they created the binder
###120 and handed it
###122 to the incoming governor at the time
###125 sorrow maybe a slight distinction small fed by mit romney
###130 of course according to burstein
###132 uh... he did appoint fourteen women out of his first thirty three senior level
###136 appointments but they were all in agencies you didn't care about
###142 and it also raises the question
###144 how is it that guy who had been working in business for twenty five years in
###148 senior management
###149 balancing budgets
###150 doing all the negro league
###153 saving the olympics
###155 never came across one woman he thought was qualified to serve in his
###159 administration
###161 they've got
###163 abundant
###166 also throughout his administration if there was a decline a a progressive
###171 decline throughout his administration a woman working under yasir ended up being
###174 less women uh... than than than at the beginning but
###178 let's not get the picking
###181 sometimes the binders are not uh... you they just the binders don't show up
