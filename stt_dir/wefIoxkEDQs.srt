anti-creationists don't want you to see or


9
0:0:47,36 --> 0:0:50,56
hear, and we  show the glory of God in the
Creation.

13
0:1:3,61 --> 0:1:8,51
Live science carried an interview with Dr.
Jack Horner, famous paleontologist who


14
0:1:8,51 --> 0:1:13,83
was a consultant and inspiration for the
characters in "Jurassic park".  Jack has


15
0:1:13,83 --> 0:1:19,53
decided he wants to pull a Jurassic park
and make a modern day dinosaur.  But not


16
0:1:19,53 --> 0:1:24,72
in the way the movie showed - nope.  He
wants to de-evolve a chicken back into a


17
0:1:24,72 --> 0:1:28,91
dinosaur - cause after all, as we all know,
chickens are living dinosaurs.


18

20
0:1:39,49 --> 0:1:40,98
Bragawk!


21
0:1:40,98 --> 0:1:42,4
<swoosh>


22
0:1:42,4 --> 0:1:45,94
I have great respect for Dr. Horner, but
his comments and the live science article


23
0:1:45,94 --> 0:1:50,41
were filled with incredible amounts of
unfounded evolutionary propaganda and


24
0:1:50,41 --> 0:1:54,6
assumptions.  The first and foremost
assumption being that birds evolved from


25
0:1:54,6 --> 0:1:58,42
dinosaurs!
As I mentioned in passing last week, this


26
0:1:58,42 --> 0:2:3,74
is a typical evolutionary claim - complete
with your average evolutionary thinker


27
0:2:3,74 --> 0:2:10,21
citing feathered dinosaurs as proof that
dinosaurs evolved into birds. Until you


28
0:2:10,21 --> 0:2:14,92
point out that based on the evolutionarily
assigned ages of the fossils, the


29
0:2:14,92 --> 0:2:19,79
evolutionary timeline is reversed.
According to the evolutionary timeline,


30
0:2:19,79 --> 0:2:24,52
the feathered dinosaurs were evolving
into un-feathered dinosaurs.  And let us


31
0:2:24,52 --> 0:2:28,91
not forget the Nature article from a few
months back which ruffled a whole pile of


32
0:2:28,91 --> 0:2:35,44
feathers after reporting a cretaceous
fossil duck!


33
0:2:35,44 --> 0:2:39,36
Ya, ya, I know - Jurassic and Cretaceous
aren't the same time periods, but the


34
0:2:39,36 --> 0:2:43,44
word "Cretaceous" doesn't lend itself to
humour.


35
0:2:43,44 --> 0:2:48,7
 and we find completely modern bird
fossils like protoavis in rocks that are


36
0:2:48,7 --> 0:2:52,36
allegedly older than the dinosaurs birds
were supposed to have been evolved


37
0:2:52,36 --> 0:2:54,65
from!
For these and many more reasons,


38
0:2:54,65 --> 0:3:0,61
prominent evolutionists like Alan Feduccia
and Stors Olson do not believe birds


39
0:3:0,61 --> 0:3:4,39
evolved from dinosaurs.
And this is ignoring other problems for


40
0:3:4,39 --> 0:3:9,54
the dino to bird hypothesis such as the
fossil footprints from Nova Scotia -


41
0:3:9,54 --> 0:3:17,47
allegedly 350 million years old  - which
sure look like fossil Ostrich tracks.


42
0:3:17,47 --> 0:3:21,7
In spite of the fact that you cannot be
your Grandfather's father, among other


43
0:3:21,7 --> 0:3:26,56
problems, Horner embraces the
dino-to-bird ancestry, and bases his


44
0:3:26,56 --> 0:3:30,84
proposition on this assumption.
As Stephanie Pappas wrote in the


45
0:3:30,84 --> 0:3:58,2
LiveScience article, 


46
0:3:58,2 --> 0:4:3,48
In other words, if chickens evolved from
the dinosaurs, then the "plans" for the


47
0:4:3,48 --> 0:4:8,44
dinosaurs would still be left over in the
chicken's DNA, and he's just gotta figure


48
0:4:8,44 --> 0:4:11,92
out how to throw the right switches to get
the chicken to make dinosaur parts


49
0:4:11,92 --> 0:4:13,9
instead of chicken parts.


50
0:4:13,9 --> 0:4:18,55
Just what would that take?  Well, first
you'd have turn off the switches that


51
0:4:18,55 --> 0:4:23,6
control the genes that make the chicken's
bird-like hip, then you need to turn on the


52
0:4:23,6 --> 0:4:28,2
gene that makes a lizard's hip.  And
doesn't it seem odd to you that the


53
0:4:28,2 --> 0:4:31,99
evolutionists would claim that birds
evolved from the dinosaurs which have


54
0:4:31,99 --> 0:4:37,5
lizard hips, rather than the dinosaurs
which have hips like a bird?  Like the


55
0:4:37,5 --> 0:4:41,87
hadrosaurs - they lay eggs like a bird,
have bird-like hips, have a bill like a


56
0:4:41,87 --> 0:4:46,36
duck's bill, yet the evolutionists claim the
birds evolved from the group of dinosaurs


57
0:4:46,36 --> 0:4:50,68
which involves T-rex (which has lizard
hips), and the long necked, sauropod


58
0:4:50,68 --> 0:4:54,55
dinosaurs which are lot more like an
elephant than anything!


59
0:4:54,55 --> 0:4:59,98
Then Jack's gotta locate and turn off the
genes that produce feathers and turn on


60
0:4:59,98 --> 0:5:4,29
the genes that make scales. He's also
gotta find the genes that turn off the wing


61
0:5:4,29 --> 0:5:10,26
formation and turn on the arm formation,
find the genes that make the fourth digit


62
0:5:10,26 --> 0:5:15,74
on the wing turn off and turn on the first
digit gene, etc...


63
0:5:15,74 --> 0:5:19,48
All I can say is "Good luck with that, let
me know how it goes."


64
0:5:19,48 --> 0:5:25,74
But Horner calls upon the erroneous,
long-discredited "science" of vestigial


65
0:5:25,74 --> 0:5:31,18
organs or parts, and embryonic
recapitulation.  Haeckel's drawings were


66
0:5:31,18 --> 0:5:37,0
shown to be fraudulent 150 years ago, yet
his drawings and false claims are simply


67
0:5:37,0 --> 0:5:42,54
dressed up in a different, nicer looking
business suit and put in our textbooks.


68
0:5:42,54 --> 0:5:46,74
Horner quotes a classic example of this
idea, specifically talking about the human


69
0:5:46,74 --> 0:5:55,47
"tail", saying:


70
0:5:55,47 --> 0:6:3,65
Hogwash!  It is nothing but a tall tale to
call that a tail! It is not a tail, but a somite


71
0:6:3,65 --> 0:6:10,4
- developing organs, tissues, etc...
Describing it as a "tail" is nothing less


72
0:6:10,4 --> 0:6:13,46
than evolutionary propaganda - in fact, it
is misleading.


73
0:6:13,46 --> 0:6:18,21
David Coppedge over at Creation
Evolution Headlines had this to say about


74
0:6:18,21 --> 0:6:46,9
the Horner and the live science article:


75
0:6:46,9 --> 0:6:50,8
I might also add that Horner is not just
referring to Creationists as being


76
0:6:50,8 --> 0:6:56,86
"misinformed", but other evolutionists
such as Alan Feduccia and Larry Martin.


77
0:6:56,86 --> 0:7:1,56
Horner is also ignoring oodles of evidence
I have only mentioned in passing here, in


78
0:7:1,56 --> 0:7:4,94
order to embrace the dino-to-bird
hypothesis.


79
0:7:4,94 --> 0:7:10,82
Of course,  as Coppedge pointed out: If
you're going to de-evolve a chicken, why


80
0:7:10,82 --> 0:7:15,76
stop at the dinosaur?  If Horner's
ludicrous assumptions were correct, then


81
0:7:15,76 --> 0:7:23,19
you could de-evolve a chicken into an
amphibian, a fish, a worm, a protoplasm,


82
0:7:23,19 --> 0:7:24,76
etc...


83
0:7:24,76 --> 0:7:30,82
Stephanie Pappas also authored snother
live science article, "New Year brings New


84
0:7:30,82 --> 0:7:33,56
attacks on evolution in schools."


85
0:7:33,56 --> 0:7:37,9
That's right, more whining over the
introduction of legislative bills that either


86
0:7:37,9 --> 0:7:43,73
allow teaching of creation or critique of
evolution in the public schools.  Eugenie


87
0:7:43,73 --> 0:7:48,33
Scott, Executive director of the National
Center for Science Eradication was


88
0:7:48,33 --> 0:8:29,6
quoted by live science regarding Indiana's
proposed bill to include creation science, 


89
0:8:29,6 --> 0:8:34,82
Let's get one thing straight here:
Evolutionism IS controversial.  The only


90
0:8:34,82 --> 0:8:39,4
reason evolutionism has survived in the
schools is because it must hide behind


91
0:8:39,4 --> 0:8:44,9
lawyers, judges, and school policies.
When was the last time you heard of a


92
0:8:44,9 --> 0:8:49,93
physicist seeking court protection for his
theory to be taught in schools without


93
0:8:49,93 --> 0:8:57,22
scrutiny?  You haven't heard of it because
it's moronic.  Either the theory stands or


94
0:8:57,22 --> 0:9:3,72
falls under scrutiny. But yet, this is
precisely what evolution has required:


95
0:9:3,72 --> 0:9:9,24
Court protection from scrutiny. Why?
Because evolution disintegrates under


96
0:9:9,24 --> 0:9:12,3
even minor scrutiny.


97
0:9:12,3 --> 0:9:15,65
Oh - and by the way, yes the supreme
court said it was unconstituntional to


98
0:9:15,65 --> 0:9:19,69
force schools to teach creationary
theories, however they also ruled it was


99
0:9:19,69 --> 0:9:24,37
not unconstitutional to permit such
teaching.


100
0:9:24,37 --> 0:9:28,93
[Scary, dramatic music]


101
0:9:28,93 --> 0:9:35,23
Wahoo! Mail for me?


102
0:9:35,23 --> 0:9:39,96
[Scary, dramatic music]


103
0:9:39,96 --> 0:9:43,95
The last episode of Genesis week was
launched into the #3 position of most


104
0:9:43,95 --> 0:9:47,93
discussed videos in science and
technology within two days of posting it.


105
0:9:47,93 --> 0:9:53,28
Over 600 hate-filled, rabid comments were
left which were quite revealing.  Feel the


106
0:9:53,28 --> 0:10:1,21
LOVE!  First of all, why were the skeptics
so emotional? This is science - if I'm


107
0:10:1,21 --> 0:10:6,49
wrong about something, then correct me.
Instead, what I got was a barrage of very


108
0:10:6,49 --> 0:10:10,37
personal and venomous attack.
It seemed the only thing the skeptics


109
0:10:10,37 --> 0:10:17,2
agreed upon was that I was a flagrant liar
for Jesus.  Besides being an incredibly


110
0:10:17,2 --> 0:10:21,36
presumptuous accusation, they couldn't
seem to agree on what it was exactly that


111
0:10:21,36 --> 0:10:27,43
I was lying about!  Well, that just speaks
volumes of the anti-creationist claims and


112
0:10:27,43 --> 0:10:30,42
false accusations.
It was quite entertaining to watch the


113
0:10:30,42 --> 0:10:34,9
skeptics contradict themselves, and each
other!  Go read the comments for


114
0:10:34,9 --> 0:10:39,23
yourself!  Then to add to that, mutliple
people got downright angry at me for


115
0:10:39,23 --> 0:10:44,63
saying that birds evolved from dinosaurs.
Uhhhh, hellloooo, it was an evolutionist


116
0:10:44,63 --> 0:10:48,94
who said that, not me - I was merely
responding to the evolutionist.


117
0:10:48,94 --> 0:10:53,37
This is a lesson I learned many years ago
when we held the skeptic's night at


118
0:10:53,37 --> 0:10:57,89
Carleton University in Ottawa, the first
event of the week-long National Capital


119
0:10:57,89 --> 0:11:2,5
Creation Conference.  It was standing
room only in the lecture hall, and for the


120
0:11:2,5 --> 0:11:5,75
next week, I heard from lots of people
who had been to the skeptic's night -


121
0:11:5,75 --> 0:11:10,46
including people who were not
creationists nor Bible believers - but they


122
0:11:10,46 --> 0:11:14,51
all said the same thing.  The one thing
from the skeptic's night that convinced


123
0:11:14,51 --> 0:11:19,19
them the most that maybe - just maybe,
the creationary thinkers were actually


124
0:11:19,19 --> 0:11:25,34
right, was the extreme emotional,
irrational, and illogical behaviour and


125
0:11:25,34 --> 0:11:30,36
comments of the atheists and
anti-creationists.  NObody does a better


126
0:11:30,36 --> 0:11:36,22
job of making the anti-creationists look
bad than the anti-creationists do. And this


127
0:11:36,22 --> 0:11:39,77
is precisely why I leave the comments
open on my videos, so the whooole world


128
0:11:39,77 --> 0:11:43,34
can see exactly what they are saying.


129
0:11:43,34 --> 0:11:47,72
This is typical of the quality of
argumentation from the anti-creationist


130
0:11:47,72 --> 0:11:51,17
camp.  It's not difficult to point out the
glaring errors in their claims, and if you


131
0:11:51,17 --> 0:11:55,7
pay attention, they themselves usually
point out their own glaring errors for you


132
0:11:55,7 --> 0:11:58,9
- even contradicting themselves and each
other.


133
0:11:58,9 --> 0:12:4,75
I'm not out to poke fun of people or just
"prove them wrong" - but rather I want to


134
0:12:4,75 --> 0:12:9,51
search out and find the TRUTH - which I
have personally found to be Jesus Christ,


135
0:12:9,51 --> 0:12:14,57
our Creator.  So why then such emotional
and personal reaction? I'm only talking


136
0:12:14,57 --> 0:12:21,99
about scientific matters.  It's because
these scientific matters point to a Creator,


137
0:12:21,99 --> 0:12:29,21
which these anti-creationists wish to
reject and hate.  So the hatred and


138
0:12:29,21 --> 0:12:34,63
irrationality of rejecting their creator spills
over on to me - and I'm okay with that.


139
0:12:34,63 --> 0:12:38,2
There's so much more I wanted to talk
about this week, but I'm out of time. Join
