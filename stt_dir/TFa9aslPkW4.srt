2
0:0:32,567 --> 0:0:35,487
Bernard, another solicitor's letter.


3
0:0:35,487 --> 0:0:43,487
Put it with the others.


4
0:0:43,487 --> 0:1:12,247
- Maybe you should read it.
- (Sighs)


5
0:1:12,247 --> 0:1:14,287
What is this?


6
0:1:14,287 --> 0:1:18,807
Well, the woman upstairs
wants her £170-a-month ground rent.


7
0:1:18,807 --> 0:1:20,847
She doesn't need any more money.


8
0:1:20,847 --> 0:1:24,87
She's already got
all the blue hair and toffee


9
0:1:24,87 --> 0:1:26,167
and pop socks a person could want.


10
0:1:26,167 --> 0:1:30,127
- There's nothing you can do.
- Go and tell her to stop.


11
0:1:30,127 --> 0:1:33,607
Or we'll cut the brakes
on her StairMaster.


12
0:1:33,607 --> 0:1:37,927
No time. I'm setting up the shop
for the Festival of Travel Writing.


13
0:1:37,927 --> 0:1:41,767
- What festival?
- The one you said Manny could have.


14
0:1:41,767 --> 0:1:44,207
I don't remember agreeing to that.


15
0:1:44,207 --> 0:1:48,527
Remember that night last week
when you slept in a revolving door?


16
0:1:48,527 --> 0:1:51,567
- No.
- Remember you ran out of tobacco


17
0:1:51,567 --> 0:1:54,207
so you smoked your own pubic hair?


18
0:1:54,207 --> 0:1:56,247
Not especially, no.


19
0:1:56,247 --> 0:1:59,207
It was in-between those two things.


20
0:1:59,207 --> 0:2:3,47
- I've had an idea for your event.
- Great.


21
0:2:3,47 --> 0:2:8,647
Everyone can vote for what they think
is the most stylish city in Europe.


22
0:2:8,647 --> 0:2:12,807
- (Laughs)
- At the end of the week, you...


23
0:2:12,807 --> 0:2:15,487
- Oh. (Chuckles)
- What?


24
0:2:15,487 --> 0:2:18,167
Oh, Europe. You are funny, Fran.


25
0:2:18,167 --> 0:2:22,807
I hardly think your little jaunts
to Europe count as travel.


26
0:2:22,807 --> 0:2:24,847
Well, pardon me!


27
0:2:24,847 --> 0:2:27,287
This isn't a festival for tourists.


28
0:2:27,287 --> 0:2:29,967
An explorer is coming to give a talk.


29
0:2:29,967 --> 0:2:34,807
The... the legendary,
famously charming Jason Hamilton.


30
0:2:34,807 --> 0:2:39,967
Let's have a look, then. Every one
of these blurbs says he's charming.


31
0:2:39,967 --> 0:2:43,647
"I was swept away on a wave of charm.


32
0:2:43,647 --> 0:2:48,87
"I was immolated in a firewall
of charm and charisma.


33
0:2:48,87 --> 0:2:52,567
"I almost exploded from the
concentration of charm on the page."


34
0:2:52,567 --> 0:2:54,727
I bet you I can open this anywhere


35
0:2:54,727 --> 0:3:0,127
and find this fop
posing on a Jeep, looking smug.


36
0:3:0,127 --> 0:3:4,7
Ha! Ha! Ha!


37
0:3:4,7 --> 0:3:6,47
Let's see.


38
0:3:6,47 --> 0:3:8,607
Oh, God, look at him!


39
0:3:8,607 --> 0:3:10,887
Look at that love-me smile.


40
0:3:10,887 --> 0:3:14,287
I know his sort,
a full-time approval junkie.


41
0:3:14,287 --> 0:3:17,407
He's brilliant. He's a giant in his field.


42
0:3:17,407 --> 0:3:22,167
Manny, can I be the first
to say, "Oo-oo-oooh"?


43
0:3:22,167 --> 0:3:26,847
You gonna scratch his name
on your pencil box?


44
0:3:26,847 --> 0:3:29,47
Manny, run me through this again.


45
0:3:29,47 --> 0:3:33,447
Right. Basically, there's
the leaseholders and freeholders.


46
0:3:33,447 --> 0:3:35,727
There's two types of leaseholder.


47
0:3:35,727 --> 0:3:39,887
There's common-law leaseholder
and private leaseholders, which are...


48
0:3:39,887 --> 0:3:45,287
Stop! Stop saying those words!
Give me that. I'm going upstairs.


49
0:3:45,287 --> 0:3:57,367
I'll deal with this,
like I deal with everything. Everything!


50
0:3:57,367 --> 0:4:3,847
Hanley! Hanley, come out,
you bloodsucker! Hanley!


51
0:4:3,847 --> 0:4:7,687
Miss Hanley is dead.
She died in the night.


52
0:4:7,687 --> 0:4:9,807
I don't care. I mean, how awful!


53
0:4:9,807 --> 0:4:12,87
You're the new owner.
Explain this bollocks.


54
0:4:12,87 --> 0:4:16,447
I'm a solicitor.
Miss Hanley left this flat to Mr Benson.


55
0:4:16,447 --> 0:4:18,687
What did you want to query, Mr...?


56
0:4:18,687 --> 0:4:21,207
Black. I'll talk directly with him.


57
0:4:21,207 --> 0:4:25,327
I don't want any legal fidgy-widginess
upsetting natural justice.


58
0:4:25,327 --> 0:4:29,207
Benson. Benson. Benson?


59
0:4:29,207 --> 0:4:31,47
Where is he?


60
0:4:31,47 --> 0:4:32,687
Mr Benson is in the bread bin.


61
0:4:32,687 --> 0:4:35,327
I said no legal fidgy-widginess.


62
0:4:35,327 --> 0:4:38,767
I want to see the owner,
I want to see them now.


63
0:4:38,767 --> 0:4:43,887
- And I want...
- (Meows)


64
0:4:43,887 --> 0:4:45,927
He likes to sleep there.


65
0:4:45,927 --> 0:4:49,847
- What d'you want to say to him?
- I'm not paying this.


66
0:4:49,847 --> 0:4:53,927
- If you don't, you'll go to prison.
- I'm not talking to you.


67
0:4:53,927 --> 0:4:57,47
Fine. Well, if that's all,
I've got a meeting.


68
0:4:57,47 --> 0:5:0,7
Who with? Canary in Canary Wharf?


69
0:5:0,7 --> 0:5:4,607
A fox with stocks? You can't leave
an animal in here. He'll go insane.


70
0:5:4,607 --> 0:5:6,967
It's Miss Hanley's will, so it's law.


71
0:5:6,967 --> 0:5:11,727
Yeah? Well, you don't intimidate me,
Miss... Purcell Harding LaTouche


72
0:5:11,727 --> 0:5:15,207
MSc, LLB, MA, DPhil, MBE,


73
0:5:15,207 --> 0:5:24,927
- Rowing blue, grade two...
- (Door slams)


74
0:5:24,927 --> 0:5:30,687
Right. Er... hair loose. Loose.
Free as the wind.


75
0:5:30,687 --> 0:5:34,327
Ponytail. Ponytail? Frizzled. Ooh!


76
0:5:34,327 --> 0:5:37,127
- Oh.
- Expecting someone?


77
0:5:37,127 --> 0:5:41,87
- Might be.
- It's that Jason thingy, isn't it?


78
0:5:41,87 --> 0:5:46,407
Well, he said he might drop round
to see where he was doing his talk.


79
0:5:46,407 --> 0:5:55,767
- Let's have a sample.
- Don't touch the display!


80
0:5:55,767 --> 0:5:59,647
Manny, isn't it?


81
0:5:59,647 --> 0:6:1,687
The shop that time forgot.


82
0:6:1,687 --> 0:6:5,527
I thought I'd been to
all the uncharted areas of the globe.


83
0:6:5,527 --> 0:6:9,247
This is great! It's got bags of character.


84
0:6:9,247 --> 0:6:12,767
(Simpering laugh)


85
0:6:12,767 --> 0:6:15,567
H... (Clears throat) Hello, Jason.


86
0:6:15,567 --> 0:6:20,447
It's lovely to meet you. Really.
I'm a great admirer of your work


87
0:6:20,447 --> 0:6:23,847
and your life and...
Watch out, a crocodile!


88
0:6:23,847 --> 0:6:27,407
(Laughs hysterically)
Behind you! Look!


89
0:6:27,407 --> 0:6:31,447
It's not really.
It's an inflatable one l-I put up there.


90
0:6:31,447 --> 0:6:35,247
Just a... just a little one. (Chuckles)


91
0:6:35,247 --> 0:6:42,727
(High-pitched giggle)


92
0:6:42,727 --> 0:6:47,47
So... so, where are you going
on your next adventure?


93
0:6:47,47 --> 0:6:52,327
I thought maybe Borneo. The real
Borneo, not the jungle nonsense.


94
0:6:52,327 --> 0:6:54,807
The ice caves under the jungle.


95
0:6:54,807 --> 0:6:58,407
Right. I'll tell you
where you should go - Venezuela.


96
0:6:58,407 --> 0:7:2,527
- Dear old Venny. You been there?
- Yes, I have, actually.


97
0:7:2,527 --> 0:7:6,287
I went kayaking
in the swamps of the barracas.


98
0:7:6,287 --> 0:7:8,327
- North or south?
- North.


99
0:7:8,327 --> 0:7:10,887
North, the tourist swamps. Yeah.


100
0:7:10,887 --> 0:7:14,807
I went to the south.
The south are the real swamps.


101
0:7:14,807 --> 0:7:17,327
The northern ones are pretty swampy.


102
0:7:17,327 --> 0:7:21,127
They're nothing.


103
0:7:21,127 --> 0:7:26,247
So, Jason, this talk - how d'you
wanna do it? I've got a few ideas.


104
0:7:26,247 --> 0:7:28,287
Hi. How's it going?


105
0:7:28,287 --> 0:7:32,367
- It's too soon to tell if I like it or not.
- I know what you mean.


106
0:7:32,367 --> 0:7:41,167
I won't find out if I keep
being interrupted, will I?


107
0:7:41,167 --> 0:7:43,487
Someone like you would love Mugumbi.


108
0:7:43,487 --> 0:7:46,367
How can you know? I might hate it.


109
0:7:46,367 --> 0:7:50,807
I don't think so. They all worship
a goddess remarkably like you.


110
0:7:50,807 --> 0:7:55,47
A sort of panther-woman.
Same pale skin, thick jet hair,


111
0:7:55,47 --> 0:7:57,927
slumberous eyes. For a minute, I...


112
0:7:57,927 --> 0:8:0,567
I thought I was back at the temple.


113
0:8:0,567 --> 0:8:13,567
(Giggles hysterically)


114
0:8:13,567 --> 0:8:17,207
Bernard, I wonder if you might
have a word with Fran.


115
0:8:17,207 --> 0:8:21,847
Tell her I'm looking after Jason
and he doesn't appreciate her flirting.


116
0:8:21,847 --> 0:8:25,447
- Shh!
- (Meowing)


117
0:8:25,447 --> 0:8:30,367
You hear that? He's up there, mewing
in the nerve centre of his empire.


118
0:8:30,367 --> 0:8:32,807
A hike in rent here, tax dodge there.


119
0:8:32,807 --> 0:8:36,247
He sticks his leg in the air,
laughs his cat-laugh


120
0:8:36,247 --> 0:8:39,807
and then he dives back
to grooming his balls.


121
0:8:39,807 --> 0:8:43,527
- You can't hear that, surely.
- I've heard enough.


122
0:8:43,527 --> 0:8:47,967
It's all very well for you,
flouncing about after Captain Pants.


123
0:8:47,967 --> 0:8:51,927
You don't know what I go through
with this cat. I hate all cats!


124
0:8:51,927 --> 0:8:56,207
You're probably more of a dog person.
Let's get a dog for the shop.


125
0:8:56,207 --> 0:9:0,7
I think not. The one we have
doesn't do much for me.


126
0:9:0,7 --> 0:9:12,967
We don't have a dog. Ooh! Ooh!


127
0:9:12,967 --> 0:9:17,167
What's he like, then,
this overgrown schoolboy?


128
0:9:17,167 --> 0:9:20,647
Thinks Britain
still owns the world, obviously.


129
0:9:20,647 --> 0:9:25,127
- Don't talk about Jason in that way.
- He's magnificent.


130
0:9:25,127 --> 0:9:28,7
I see he got to you pretty quick.


131
0:9:28,7 --> 0:9:29,447
Hey.


132
0:9:29,447 --> 0:9:32,47
- Jason!
- Hi, Jase.


133
0:9:32,47 --> 0:9:35,807
Thought I'd pop into
my favourite book emporium.


134
0:9:35,807 --> 0:9:39,807
Doctor Black, I presume?


135
0:9:39,807 --> 0:9:42,607
You don't look like much of an explorer.


136
0:9:42,607 --> 0:9:46,327
You look like you've been
exploring luxury hotels.


137
0:9:46,327 --> 0:9:48,447
Why not write about that?


138
0:9:48,447 --> 0:9:55,167
The Cote d'Azur - One Man's Struggle
With 100%/% Egyptian Cotton Sheets.


139
0:9:55,167 --> 0:9:59,207
You've got a fine shop here
and you say what you feel.


140
0:9:59,207 --> 0:10:6,967
I'd like to shake you by the hand.


141
0:10:6,967 --> 0:10:11,127
(Simpering laugh)


142
0:10:11,127 --> 0:10:17,967
That's my chair, d'you want to sit in that?


143
0:10:17,967 --> 0:10:20,607
You didn't even make him any tea!


144
0:10:20,607 --> 0:10:23,407
- Would you like some tea?
- Wonderful.


145
0:10:23,407 --> 0:10:26,167
- I was gonna make tea.
- So was I!


146
0:10:26,167 --> 0:10:39,367
It'll be ready in a minute.


147
0:10:39,367 --> 0:10:43,127
Nice cups.


148
0:10:43,127 --> 0:10:47,767
Hm-hm. Biscuits.


149
0:10:47,767 --> 0:10:49,807
The nice biscuits.


150
0:10:49,807 --> 0:10:57,727
My biscuit. Jason can have my biscuit.


151
0:10:57,727 --> 0:11:3,567
Hah.


152
0:11:3,567 --> 0:11:23,687
(Chuckles)


153
0:11:23,687 --> 0:11:26,887
(Giggles) Oh.


154
0:11:26,887 --> 0:11:30,367
The biscuit!
Jason's special biscuit!


155
0:11:30,367 --> 0:11:33,687
Right! You thing!


156
0:11:33,687 --> 0:11:36,687
That's it! Say goodbye, Mr Benson.


157
0:11:36,687 --> 0:11:48,207
You have just pulled
the tinkly bell of death!


158
0:11:48,207 --> 0:11:51,847
- You had dust on your knees.
- Thank you, Fran.


159
0:11:51,847 --> 0:11:54,327
- All set for the talk?
- I am.


160
0:11:54,327 --> 0:11:58,7
- Good. Everything all right?
- Absolutely fine.


161
0:11:58,7 --> 0:12:3,47
There is one little thing.
Only a very small thing.


162
0:12:3,47 --> 0:12:8,47
- You are standing rather close.
- Oh. Sorry.


163
0:12:8,47 --> 0:12:10,687
- Is this all right?
- That's fine.


164
0:12:10,687 --> 0:12:13,527
Excuse me, are you Jason Hamilton?


165
0:12:13,527 --> 0:12:15,767
Get away from him! Get away.


166
0:12:15,767 --> 0:12:22,727
He doesn't want people crowding him.
Just get out. You're barred.


167
0:12:22,727 --> 0:12:26,367
So sorry, Jason. Oh!


168
0:12:26,367 --> 0:12:30,407
- So sorry, Jason.
- Wanted to have a chat to you two.


169
0:12:30,407 --> 0:12:33,887
This trip to Borneo for the next book...


170
0:12:33,887 --> 0:12:37,927
It's so much more rewarding
if you have a companion.


171
0:12:37,927 --> 0:12:42,927
A fellow voyager.
Manny, you've travelled a lot.


172
0:12:42,927 --> 0:12:47,7
Don't you think Fran would be
the perfect companion for the trip?


173
0:12:47,7 --> 0:12:49,167
Fran, I don't need a yes or no now.


174
0:12:49,167 --> 0:12:51,767
Yes!


175
0:12:51,767 --> 0:12:57,967
No. You don't want this... this...
No offence, Fran. Mopsy!


176
0:12:57,967 --> 0:13:2,7
You need someone with
a few miles under their belt. A man.


177
0:13:2,7 --> 0:13:5,287
Or a woman. But a man!
A seasoned traveller.


178
0:13:5,287 --> 0:13:9,967
The sort of man who's got a penknife
and an emergency backup penknife.


179
0:13:9,967 --> 0:13:13,287
Maybe you underestimate
your friend, Manny.


180
0:13:13,287 --> 0:13:17,807
Now, Fran. Would you say
that you had jungle experience -


181
0:13:17,807 --> 0:13:21,727
bearing in mind
it could be handy on this trip.


182
0:13:21,727 --> 0:13:24,447
- Does Corfu count?
- You've been to Corfu?


183
0:13:24,447 --> 0:13:25,687
No.


184
0:13:25,687 --> 0:13:30,87
- Anything else?
- I'm a trained field doctor.


185
0:13:30,87 --> 0:13:34,367
I can fix a Jeep in a hurricane.
And I speak 32 African languages.


186
0:13:34,367 --> 0:13:39,607
- Borneo is, of course, in Asia.
- Yes. Yes. 32 Asian languages.


187
0:13:39,607 --> 0:13:47,327
That's settled then.
Manny, you're doing it again.


188
0:13:47,327 --> 0:13:51,607
So, let me guess. Mice.
No. Wait. You've got cockroaches.


189
0:13:51,607 --> 0:13:55,847
Yeah, we do. But don't touch them,
it would upset the bat.


190
0:13:55,847 --> 0:14:0,847
Listen... I want you
to deal with this... thing.


191
0:14:0,847 --> 0:14:5,367
It's a really horrible thing.
I can't even properly describe it.


192
0:14:5,367 --> 0:14:8,847
- Essentially, it's a cat.
- Take it to the cattery.


193
0:14:8,847 --> 0:14:13,687
No. Look, I want you, you know, to...


194
0:14:13,687 --> 0:14:19,407
(Whistles) I want you to take care
of business with this cat, OK?


195
0:14:19,407 --> 0:14:23,207
- Can I make it any clearer?
- You could, actually.


196
0:14:23,207 --> 0:14:26,687
OK, he dies tonight. How about that?


197
0:14:26,687 --> 0:14:28,967
No. I could never harm a cat.


198
0:14:28,967 --> 0:14:32,207
Come on, you're a pest guy.
You kill things.


199
0:14:32,207 --> 0:14:37,127
Only vermin. I love animals.
I'm saving up to go to vet school.


200
0:14:37,127 --> 0:14:39,567
Yeah, but you know, this is like...


201
0:14:39,567 --> 0:14:44,47
It's one cat, it's nothing.
Badda-bing, badda-meow!


202
0:14:44,47 --> 0:14:48,887
You disgust me. An innocent
little creature like that. Goodbye.


203
0:14:48,887 --> 0:14:51,487
A grand.


204
0:14:51,487 --> 0:14:55,567
Thousand pounds. In cash.
You'd be out of this stuff.


205
0:14:55,567 --> 0:15:0,607
Tomorrow you'll be giving
an aardvark a skin graft.


206
0:15:0,607 --> 0:15:5,287
You wouldn't even like this cat.
He's a bully. He sprays everywhere.


207
0:15:5,287 --> 0:15:8,607
He's up there now,
out of his mind on nip.


208
0:15:8,607 --> 0:15:11,407
Nobody needs to know.


209
0:15:11,407 --> 0:15:14,447
OK. Bring a bag and bleach


210
0:15:14,447 --> 0:15:22,567
and three tins of Royal Meow.


211
0:15:22,567 --> 0:15:26,407
- Fran.
- Mm?


212
0:15:26,407 --> 0:15:30,927
I'd like to have a word with you.
Just as a friend, you understand.


213
0:15:30,927 --> 0:15:33,447
I think that Jason might want you


214
0:15:33,447 --> 0:15:38,47
as something more than
just a travelling companion.


215
0:15:38,47 --> 0:15:40,887
If you... follow me.


216
0:15:40,887 --> 0:15:44,127
If you... get my meaning.


217
0:15:44,127 --> 0:15:50,287
If you... catch my drift. Hm?


218
0:15:50,287 --> 0:15:52,687
You mean we might be in a situation


219
0:15:52,687 --> 0:15:56,727
where because of cramped conditions
we'd have to... Oh, goodness.


220
0:15:56,727 --> 0:16:1,7
Yes... bunk up.


221
0:16:1,7 --> 0:16:4,447
Together. You know
what that means, don't you?


222
0:16:4,447 --> 0:16:7,127
I don't need to bring any sleeping gear.


223
0:16:7,127 --> 0:16:11,527
It'll be too hot to hock around
two shag-bags. Thanks, Manny.


224
0:16:11,527 --> 0:16:14,447
Oh! You're just doing it for kicks.


225
0:16:14,447 --> 0:16:17,727
It's my one chance to trek with my hero.


226
0:16:17,727 --> 0:16:21,967
Oh, Manny. It really does
mean a lot to you, doesn't it?


227
0:16:21,967 --> 0:16:25,967
It was the whole point
of me being born.


228
0:16:25,967 --> 0:16:29,447
I know.


229
0:16:29,447 --> 0:16:35,447
But he picked me.


230
0:16:35,447 --> 0:16:37,487
(Chatting)


231
0:16:37,487 --> 0:16:41,647
- Another canapé, Jason?
- Thanks. Can we, er, make a start?


232
0:16:41,647 --> 0:16:44,7
Oh, right. Yes. Right.


233
0:16:44,7 --> 0:16:48,7
OK.


234
0:16:48,7 --> 0:16:50,967
So... OK.


235
0:16:50,967 --> 0:16:57,527
Erm, "Welcome...


236
0:16:57,527 --> 0:16:59,687
"to Black Books."


237
0:16:59,687 --> 0:17:5,87
(Chuckles) "And now,
who do we have for you today?


238
0:17:5,87 --> 0:17:10,607
"Someone who is
to travel and adventure...


239
0:17:10,607 --> 0:17:16,367
"but while he was waiting he got me!"


240
0:17:16,367 --> 0:17:20,7
Sorry, sorry,
I've got a bit of a mix-up there.


241
0:17:20,7 --> 0:17:22,567
Wait. Sorry. Er...


242
0:17:22,567 --> 0:17:26,367
Yes, then there was gonna be
a joke and an anecdote.


243
0:17:26,367 --> 0:17:31,607
And another joke. Erm... quite
a good one, about rice. (Laughs)


244
0:17:31,607 --> 0:17:33,647
OK. Right. Erm...


245
0:17:33,647 --> 0:17:40,287
"So, without further ado,
please welcome Jason...


246
0:17:40,287 --> 0:17:42,327
"Hamilton..."


247
0:17:42,327 --> 0:17:46,807
Thank you. Thanks.
It's a pleasure to be back in London.


248
0:17:46,807 --> 0:17:50,767
I've just come back from
an expedition to the Orinoco Basin,


249
0:17:50,767 --> 0:17:54,327
the only place you'll find
the Bearded Howler Monkey.


250
0:17:54,327 --> 0:17:57,367
Or so I thought. Until I met Manny.


251
0:17:57,367 --> 0:18:2,87
(Laughs hysterically)


252
0:18:2,87 --> 0:18:18,527
(Pretends to laugh)


253
0:18:18,527 --> 0:18:29,727
- He's not here, I'm going home.
- Wait. Come back. Sit down.


254
0:18:29,727 --> 0:18:32,767
He won't come.
Cats have got a sixth sense.


255
0:18:32,767 --> 0:18:34,807
Shut up!


256
0:18:34,807 --> 0:18:41,847
Here. He's a cat.
He doesn't have any sense.


257
0:18:41,847 --> 0:18:44,447
This won't work. They'll find out.


258
0:18:44,447 --> 0:18:48,487
Relax. Just pop him when he comes in.
I'll take care of the body.


259
0:18:48,487 --> 0:18:50,567
- How?
- I don't know.


260
0:18:50,567 --> 0:18:57,487
Put a knife in his back and leave him
slumped over the desk in the library.


261
0:18:57,487 --> 0:18:59,767
(Laughter)


262
0:18:59,767 --> 0:19:2,207
Thanks. So, what about the next trip?


263
0:19:2,207 --> 0:19:7,87
Well, I'm going to...
Fran, if you please.


264
0:19:7,87 --> 0:19:11,807
Borneo. One of the last
truly great wildernesses on earth.


265
0:19:11,807 --> 0:19:15,87
- We'll be attempting to... Yeah?
- Erm, yah.


266
0:19:15,87 --> 0:19:18,687
Your books read like imperialistic tracts.


267
0:19:18,687 --> 0:19:23,367
Do you really think you can anatomise
a whole culture in a few pages?


268
0:19:23,367 --> 0:19:25,527
- What's your name?
- Bridget.


269
0:19:25,527 --> 0:19:29,767
I write from a western perspective
cos that's my cultural background.


270
0:19:29,767 --> 0:19:34,207
- That's enough questions.
- Stick around. We'll talk it over after.


271
0:19:34,207 --> 0:19:40,527
I'd love to! (Giggles)


272
0:19:40,527 --> 0:19:44,247
I'd like to show you
the effects of mud erosion


273
0:19:44,247 --> 0:19:52,47
on a primitive office block. Fran.


274
0:19:52,47 --> 0:19:56,87
It never goes away, the guilt.


275
0:19:56,87 --> 0:19:59,447
Mice in wedding dresses
appear in your dreams.


276
0:19:59,447 --> 0:20:3,687
Whole families of roaches
stand there in silent accusation.


277
0:20:3,687 --> 0:20:21,47
- Would you shut up? He'll hear us.
- (Meowing)


278
0:20:21,47 --> 0:20:23,647
Now. Come on.


279
0:20:23,647 --> 0:20:25,687
I can't!


280
0:20:25,687 --> 0:20:30,527
Come on, he wants you to shoot him!


281
0:20:30,527 --> 0:20:38,927
What am I? What have I become?


282
0:20:38,927 --> 0:20:43,567
Aaagghh!


283
0:20:43,567 --> 0:20:46,527
(Crashing)


284
0:20:46,527 --> 0:20:50,807
(Tuts)


285
0:20:50,807 --> 0:20:53,927
Here, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty.


286
0:20:53,927 --> 0:20:57,847
- And this is where...
- (Gunshot, meowing)


287
0:20:57,847 --> 0:21:1,847
- Manny, can we stop the noise?
- I'll sort it out.


288
0:21:1,847 --> 0:21:4,887
- Leave it to me, Jason.
- I'm dealing with it.


289
0:21:4,887 --> 0:21:11,727
Oh! Wait. Wait!
Me first, me first!


290
0:21:11,727 --> 0:21:13,327
Bernard!


291
0:21:13,327 --> 0:21:16,647
- Ahh!
- (Meowing)


292
0:21:16,647 --> 0:21:19,87
Stop this! Jason is very annoyed.


293
0:21:19,87 --> 0:21:22,807
Bugger Jason. Actually, how is he?


294
0:21:22,807 --> 0:21:27,167
You come downstairs
and apologise. Right now!


295
0:21:27,167 --> 0:21:30,87
OK.


296
0:21:30,87 --> 0:21:39,927
He's not really mad at me, is he?


297
0:21:39,927 --> 0:21:45,327
(Sighs) Look what you've done.
Didn't even get to phone him a taxi.


298
0:21:45,327 --> 0:21:54,967
He must have left a note for me.
We're leaving tomorrow.


299
0:21:54,967 --> 0:21:59,527
Nobody move.


300
0:21:59,527 --> 0:22:2,967
Bernard, I think
we should talk about this.


301
0:22:2,967 --> 0:22:6,567
- OK. Sure. We'll talk about it.
- Good.


302
0:22:6,567 --> 0:22:9,687
Right after I kill the cat.


303
0:22:9,687 --> 0:22:16,87
(Gunshot)


304
0:22:16,87 --> 0:22:20,527
So you admit you deliberately
stepped in front of the bullet?


305
0:22:20,527 --> 0:22:21,607
Yes.


306
0:22:21,607 --> 0:22:25,487
And wantonly sprayed blood
from your head all over the shop?


307
0:22:25,487 --> 0:22:26,727
Yes.


308
0:22:26,727 --> 0:22:31,967
Before wasting time writhing around
on an "emergency" operating table?


309
0:22:31,967 --> 0:22:34,247
- Yes.
- Sign here.


310
0:22:34,247 --> 0:22:36,287
No wages for seven years.


311
0:22:36,287 --> 0:22:41,447
That cat could be where he belongs -
in hell, being chased by giant mice.


312
0:22:41,447 --> 0:22:46,487
I can't believe Jason went off
with that harpy. Have you read this?


313
0:22:46,487 --> 0:22:49,527
"Sorry, Fran,
you didn't have enough experience.


314
0:22:49,527 --> 0:22:56,327
"Never mind. I'm sure Bridget
will turn out to be very handy indeed."


315
0:22:56,327 --> 0:23:0,247
I can't believe we fell for him, Manny.
Charm. Pffthh!


316
0:23:0,247 --> 0:23:2,567
I saw through him straightaway.


317
0:23:2,567 --> 0:23:5,767
I just played along with him
to confuse him.


318
0:23:5,767 --> 0:23:9,407
- Enough. Who's making the tea?
- Make it yourself.


319
0:23:9,407 --> 0:23:12,647
Yeah. I'm never doing
anything for anyone again.


320
0:23:12,647 --> 0:23:16,47
I'm not thinking about Jason.
Or what he's doing.


321
0:23:16,47 --> 0:23:20,327
I've spent my whole time
not thinking about him since he left.


322
0:23:20,327 --> 0:23:25,167
- I wish I could have a cup of tea.
- Oh, for God's... Oh.


323
0:23:25,167 --> 0:23:28,567
Make it yourse...


324
0:23:28,567 --> 0:23:31,647
- I'll get the tea.
- No, I will, Jason.


325
0:23:31,647 --> 0:23:39,0
(Both giggle)


326
0:23:39,0 --> 0:25:39,0
