1
0:0:0,54 --> 0:0:4,51
cost of water for your garden in the
value derived


2
0:0:4,51 --> 0:0:8,709
the costs and benefits of planting on
your property


3
0:0:8,709 --> 0:0:11,639
would use while five dollars and water


4
0:0:11,639 --> 0:0:15,499
for twenty thousand dollars in fruits
and vegetables


5
0:0:15,499 --> 0:0:18,63
that's what we're going to talk about in
this video


6
0:0:18,63 --> 0:0:24,119
do you realize that you can pay for the
land in most cases of profits from just


7
0:0:24,119 --> 0:0:27,38
one-year of growing things


8
0:0:27,38 --> 0:0:30,81
this is an even one acre of ground that
you need


9
0:0:30,81 --> 0:0:35,6
two thousand plans will give you a value
of twenty thousand dollars at a cost of


10
0:0:35,6 --> 0:0:39,81
about five dollars if you set up adrift
system


11
0:0:39,81 --> 0:0:42,37
like the redneck one that i built


12
0:0:42,37 --> 0:0:44,66
it works fine


13
0:0:44,66 --> 0:0:46,72
living in the desert of arizona


14
0:0:46,72 --> 0:0:49,41
i noticed a few things about plants


15
0:0:49,41 --> 0:0:51,84
they died because they lack water


16
0:0:51,84 --> 0:0:55,41
in california used to water my tomato
plants once a day and that was good


17
0:0:55,41 --> 0:0:56,32
enough


18
0:0:56,32 --> 0:1:0,84
we had the ocean nearby there was plenty
of moisture in the air and plants would


19
0:1:0,84 --> 0:1:4,17
stay somewhat more distant almanacs
water in


20
0:1:4,17 --> 0:1:5,399
but in arizona


21
0:1:5,399 --> 0:1:6,77
years much hotter


22
0:1:6,77 --> 0:1:9,18
and much drier


23
0:1:9,18 --> 0:1:12,52
some people like it because they can
drink light beer all day and it


24
0:1:12,52 --> 0:1:14,399
otherwise that it's a desert


25
0:1:14,399 --> 0:1:17,83
and they have to have some kind of
refreshment


26
0:1:17,83 --> 0:1:20,3
don't make friends with these people


27
0:1:20,3 --> 0:1:23,78
when you go over to their house they are
for you light beer


28
0:1:23,78 --> 0:1:25,27
i say to them


29
0:1:25,27 --> 0:1:27,11
i don't want like beer


30
0:1:27,11 --> 0:1:29,11
don't you have any real bear


31
0:1:29,11 --> 0:1:31,5
they say what's wrong with light beer


32
0:1:31,5 --> 0:1:36,93
i say it's just that friends don't let
friends drink a white beer


33
0:1:36,93 --> 0:1:38,71
it's a sacrilege


34
0:1:38,71 --> 0:1:39,68
lucy


35
0:1:39,68 --> 0:1:41,16
lol


36
0:1:41,16 --> 0:1:45,18
people who drink light beer don't like
the taste of beer they just like to pay


37
0:1:45,18 --> 0:1:46,549
a lot


38
0:1:46,549 --> 0:1:51,2
so if you come to arizona watch out for
those light beer drinkers


39
0:1:51,2 --> 0:1:54,58
they'll corrupt you were in no time
because it's dry and you have to have a


40
0:1:54,58 --> 0:1:59,54
beer and of all they got as light beer
you get stuck drinking that stuff


41
0:1:59,54 --> 0:2:2,3
i'd rather drink florida it'd water


42
0:2:2,3 --> 0:2:5,82
do you think the politicians drink
florida aidid water ad that they have


43
0:2:5,82 --> 0:2:9,75
pure water flow in there that the
taxpayer's expense it probably cost ten


44
0:2:9,75 --> 0:2:13,279
thousand dollars a glass and they use it
on their plants


45
0:2:13,279 --> 0:2:18,33
if i know politicians they haven't flush
their toilets with non flor dated water


46
0:2:18,33 --> 0:2:22,35
they couldn't care less of water cost
two thousand dollars a glass as long as


47
0:2:22,35 --> 0:2:23,979
you and i pay for it


48
0:2:23,979 --> 0:2:26,49
why do we need representatives


49
0:2:26,49 --> 0:2:28,419
we can't represent ourselves


50
0:2:28,419 --> 0:2:30,79
why can't we


51
0:2:30,79 --> 0:2:33,759
i never could figure that out and with
four even your drinking water you


52
0:2:33,759 --> 0:2:36,399
probably haven't even thought about it
have you


53
0:2:36,399 --> 0:2:38,869
probably asking portable work


54
0:2:38,869 --> 0:2:40,659
nevermind


55
0:2:40,659 --> 0:2:42,519
or ham and finally got


56
0:2:42,519 --> 0:2:43,739
come back to work


57
0:2:43,739 --> 0:2:45,349
maybe or us


58
0:2:45,349 --> 0:2:50,109
so i live in the body is owner which in
spanish means dry zone


59
0:2:50,109 --> 0:2:52,659
unite kitten


60
0:2:52,659 --> 0:2:56,99
the here will suck all the moisture out
of your skin


61
0:2:56,99 --> 0:2:59,15
when hillary comes here should doesn't
even have wrinkles


62
0:2:59,15 --> 0:3:3,239
her skin tightens up interface looks
like a snare drum


63
0:3:3,239 --> 0:3:5,109
with the skin all pulled tight


64
0:3:5,109 --> 0:3:9,829
you can do a drum roll on her face


65
0:3:9,829 --> 0:3:11,409
know it's true


66
0:3:11,409 --> 0:3:14,259
plans on the ground are trying to
survive


67
0:3:14,259 --> 0:3:16,249
and with hot air and dry earth


68
0:3:16,249 --> 0:3:20,129
they don't have a chance unless you
bring water to them


69
0:3:20,129 --> 0:3:24,959
after you've played servant to your
plans bringing them water every hour


70
0:3:24,959 --> 0:3:28,869
you'll want to set up an automatic
system for supplying water to your


71
0:3:28,869 --> 0:3:30,429
plants


72
0:3:30,429 --> 0:3:34,41
sales will of course we'll tell you that
you have to buy products to do this


73
0:3:34,41 --> 0:3:37,74
those with money the burden will tell
you there's no other way because they


74
0:3:37,74 --> 0:3:39,739
have a lot of money and you don't


75
0:3:39,739 --> 0:3:41,989
so if you can do it almost for free


76
0:3:41,989 --> 0:3:44,919
what's their advantage in being rich


77
0:3:44,919 --> 0:3:45,81
it's gone


78
0:3:45,81 --> 0:3:47,739
so don't listen to the rich


79
0:3:47,739 --> 0:3:49,529
rednecks are smarter


80
0:3:49,529 --> 0:3:51,83
i think you can do it almost for free


81
0:3:51,83 --> 0:3:56,13
you don't need timers regulators
pressure gauges or expensive on off


82
0:3:56,13 --> 0:3:57,789
valves


83
0:3:57,789 --> 0:4:1,409
you just need a drip system to deliver
water to your plants


84
0:4:1,409 --> 0:4:5,41
i have developed a redneck system that
works and i want to share it with you


85
0:4:5,41 --> 0:4:7,259
i don't mind in one day


86
0:4:7,259 --> 0:4:10,909
so you can do it much faster because
i'll read he did it and if you take


87
0:4:10,909 --> 0:4:11,87
notes


88
0:4:11,87 --> 0:4:14,639
make a list and carry out the same steps


89
0:4:14,639 --> 0:4:17,9
you're going to do it in half the time


90
0:4:17,9 --> 0:4:19,579
when i say one day i don't mean eight
hours


91
0:4:19,579 --> 0:4:24,32
i have less than power in the entire
thing i was already using trip bottles


92
0:4:24,32 --> 0:4:27,83
because i've been experimenting for some
time now


93
0:4:27,83 --> 0:4:31,86
and i found that plants receiving a drop
of water every ten seconds


94
0:4:31,86 --> 0:4:34,29
do just fine


95
0:4:34,29 --> 0:4:38,99
high also found that empty ketchup and
soda bottles work balanced for


96
0:4:38,99 --> 0:4:40,28
delivering the trip


97
0:4:40,28 --> 0:4:46,27
milk containers are destroyed by the sun
in very little time don't use them


98
0:4:46,27 --> 0:4:49,949
you simply catch up and soda bottles
they last a long time


99
0:4:49,949 --> 0:4:52,369
don't use full soda bottles


100
0:4:52,369 --> 0:4:55,36
because once that plan has tasted soft
drinks


101
0:4:55,36 --> 0:4:58,37
it won't be satisfied with plain water
anymore


102
0:4:58,37 --> 0:5:0,909
plans are like kids they get spoiled


103
0:5:0,909 --> 0:5:3,63
if you never allow a plan to know the
good life


104
0:5:3,63 --> 0:5:6,3
they don't expect the good life


105
0:5:6,3 --> 0:5:10,49
for example i'd bought rabbit pellets
for the wild rabbits and that was fine


106
0:5:10,49 --> 0:5:13,11
they ate them and appreciated what i
gave them


107
0:5:13,11 --> 0:5:14,139
then one day


108
0:5:14,139 --> 0:5:16,549
i gave those bunny rabbit subliminal


109
0:5:16,549 --> 0:5:19,819
and they haven't acted the same towards
me ever since


110
0:5:19,819 --> 0:5:21,28
they've gotten sort of


111
0:5:21,28 --> 0:5:22,33
uppity


112
0:5:22,33 --> 0:5:26,379
if i give them a nice plate of pellets
look at me like


113
0:5:26,379 --> 0:5:28,189
pipes she did skate


114
0:5:28,189 --> 0:5:32,56
he keeps the bananas for himself and all
we get our these dried pellets


115
0:5:32,56 --> 0:5:34,43
this is slavery


116
0:5:34,43 --> 0:5:36,5
he's a communist


117
0:5:36,5 --> 0:5:38,9
we're not good enough for bananas


118
0:5:38,9 --> 0:5:40,8
we have to eat this crap


119
0:5:40,8 --> 0:5:45,39
so now i have to buy the members every
week to keep it by rabbits happy


120
0:5:45,39 --> 0:5:48,379
if you introduced but those two bodies
two things will happen


121
0:5:48,379 --> 0:5:49,18
one


122
0:5:49,18 --> 0:5:51,24
you know of a friend for life


123
0:5:51,24 --> 0:5:54,139
to you'll have a big banana bill


124
0:5:54,139 --> 0:5:58,9
i'm joking of course the rabbits law of
the rabbit pellets


125
0:5:58,9 --> 0:6:1,9
and they also appreciate bananas and
sweet potatoes and homemade bread when


126
0:6:1,9 --> 0:6:3,319
they get it


127
0:6:3,319 --> 0:6:4,58
the homemade bread


128
0:6:4,58 --> 0:6:6,18
causes fights though


129
0:6:6,18 --> 0:6:8,4
here are two rabbits in mid-air


130
0:6:8,4 --> 0:6:9,659
this is a fight


131
0:6:9,659 --> 0:6:13,509
the female saying boys born stopped the
senseless warfare


132
0:6:13,509 --> 0:6:17,279
you guys should get along and share the
bread you're acting like a couple of


133
0:6:17,279 --> 0:6:18,439
nazis


134
0:6:18,439 --> 0:6:21,999
most of the time they get along but
homemade bread sometimes makes rabbits


135
0:6:21,999 --> 0:6:22,7
fight


136
0:6:22,7 --> 0:6:24,3
it also makes them fly


137
0:6:24,3 --> 0:6:25,569
look at the picture


138
0:6:25,569 --> 0:6:29,449
you know that rabbits throw dirt in each
others eyes in a fight


139
0:6:29,449 --> 0:6:32,65
they pick up a handful of dirt may throw
it with their finance


140
0:6:32,65 --> 0:6:35,11
i call them and they're actually pause


141
0:6:35,11 --> 0:6:36,94
maybe they've learned that from their
poll


142
0:6:36,94 --> 0:6:40,559
anyway sometimes i have twelve bunny
rabbits over for dinner


143
0:6:40,559 --> 0:6:42,5
mailed leave happy


144
0:6:42,5 --> 0:6:45,749
i'm going to have to get a fence because
i find coyote droppings


145
0:6:45,749 --> 0:6:49,43
and they're full of rabbit hair so i
know that hitting my friends


146
0:6:49,43 --> 0:6:53,37
that's just the way it is not a perfect
world so make sure you're sort of


147
0:6:53,37 --> 0:6:57,729
bottles are empty and don't get anything
started with plants you'll regret it


148
0:6:57,729 --> 0:6:59,889
i'm giving you good advice take it


149
0:6:59,889 --> 0:7:4,58
plans they're quite happy with plain
water after drop seven internal of five


150
0:7:4,58 --> 0:7:6,13
to ten seconds


151
0:7:6,13 --> 0:7:10,719
you've got happy plants even with its a
hundred and twenty degrees outside


152
0:7:10,719 --> 0:7:15,89
the automatic watering system if you
could draw your water from an existing


153
0:7:15,89 --> 0:7:16,479
tank by gravity


154
0:7:16,479 --> 0:7:18,87
and have a automatically replenish


155
0:7:18,87 --> 0:7:20,7
with a tank refill valve


156
0:7:20,7 --> 0:7:23,95
like you have a new toilet tank
reservoir than you would have a system


157
0:7:23,95 --> 0:7:25,479
that does not depend


158
0:7:25,479 --> 0:7:26,93
upon electricity


159
0:7:26,93 --> 0:7:28,25
or water pressure


160
0:7:28,25 --> 0:7:31,719
valves timers regulars and all that
expense of stuff


161
0:7:31,719 --> 0:7:33,969
save your money and buy beer with it


162
0:7:33,969 --> 0:7:35,26
that's a good investment


163
0:7:35,26 --> 0:7:39,8
tap into your toilet tank reservoir for
automatic watering


164
0:7:39,8 --> 0:7:42,25
you going to need to remove the lib


165
0:7:42,25 --> 0:7:44,349
if you have one


166
0:7:44,349 --> 0:7:47,8
benefits cracked that's even better


167
0:7:47,8 --> 0:7:48,96
just move the pieces apart


168
0:7:48,96 --> 0:7:51,25
and put your straw down into the water


169
0:7:51,25 --> 0:7:52,95
drill a hole in the wall


170
0:7:52,95 --> 0:7:56,999
and then you'll have a steady supply of
water to the outside world


171
0:7:56,999 --> 0:7:59,9
of course you have to run that line up
the wall in out


172
0:7:59,9 --> 0:8:2,229
in a few pain at the same color as the
wall


173
0:8:2,229 --> 0:8:4,389
it's less noticeable


174
0:8:4,389 --> 0:8:7,39
iran nine over the shower and help the
top


175
0:8:7,39 --> 0:8:12,4
don't worry about how high you have to
go because water will flow up still as


176
0:8:12,4 --> 0:8:18,69
long as the siphon hose is lower than
the tank on the other side of the wall


177
0:8:18,69 --> 0:8:21,359
if their style up there just use a
hamburger break some of it


178
0:8:21,359 --> 0:8:23,129
you don't need tile up there anyway


179
0:8:23,129 --> 0:8:24,669
who's going to look up there


180
0:8:24,669 --> 0:8:27,42
when people use your bathroom they don't
look up there


181
0:8:27,42 --> 0:8:30,61
when the doors locked they look at your
medicine cabinet to see what kind of


182
0:8:30,61 --> 0:8:34,46
prescriptions you're taking their snoop
here than your own government for crying


183
0:8:34,46 --> 0:8:36,35
out loud


184
0:8:36,35 --> 0:8:39,47
the hole in the wall is no bigger than a
bullet hole


185
0:8:39,47 --> 0:8:43,11
redneck or just fired on through the
wall he'd be done with the job


186
0:8:43,11 --> 0:8:45,56
he'll be having a beer before you can
say


187
0:8:45,56 --> 0:8:50,4
to fire a gun to walk there are people
living next door


188
0:8:50,4 --> 0:8:54,65
if you use the gun methadone use hollow
point because the holes too big on the


189
0:8:54,65 --> 0:8:55,93
other side


190
0:8:55,93 --> 0:9:0,24
if you have a mean life you might
already have bullet holes in your wall


191
0:9:0,24 --> 0:9:2,19
you don't have to do any drilling


192
0:9:2,19 --> 0:9:3,38
women are like that


193
0:9:3,38 --> 0:9:7,72
they catch you with another woman pol
your waterline hole is there


194
0:9:7,72 --> 0:9:9,4
and you had fun too


195
0:9:9,4 --> 0:9:10,5
uh...


196
0:9:10,5 --> 0:9:12,629
too many holes that was not good


197
0:9:12,629 --> 0:9:15,44
so try to get caught next time


198
0:9:15,44 --> 0:9:19,4
if the nazis already took your gun use a
drill


199
0:9:19,4 --> 0:9:22,88
if you don't have a drill george bush
recommend c_-four


200
0:9:22,88 --> 0:9:25,2
that's what he used on nine eleven


201
0:9:25,2 --> 0:9:27,23
but you can only get it if you're in
government


202
0:9:27,23 --> 0:9:29,87
because that stuff is highly regulated


203
0:9:29,87 --> 0:9:33,42
you need special permission to blow up
the world trade center in buildings like


204
0:9:33,42 --> 0:9:34,87
that


205
0:9:34,87 --> 0:9:37,27
so you're on a quarter-inch waterline


206
0:9:37,27 --> 0:9:40,85
from the toilet tank to the outside
world of green plants


207
0:9:40,85 --> 0:9:45,66
and it becomes a siphon hose capable of
delivering water to dozens of soda


208
0:9:45,66 --> 0:9:46,489
bottles


209
0:9:46,489 --> 0:9:48,46
which are all at the same height


210
0:9:48,46 --> 0:9:50,58
level is the name of the game


211
0:9:50,58 --> 0:9:54,2
i presume that you wanna grow flowers
fruits vegetables whatever


212
0:9:54,2 --> 0:9:55,529
and you have some kind of


213
0:9:55,529 --> 0:9:58,0
table or bench that's the right height


214
0:9:58,0 --> 0:9:59,25
if you have a bench


215
0:9:59,25 --> 0:10:2,28
and you want to put plants on it that's
ok if its level


216
0:10:2,28 --> 0:10:4,15
you can also build one


217
0:10:4,15 --> 0:10:7,26
you can stack up palates to reach the
right height


218
0:10:7,26 --> 0:10:11,249
men you know at the bend as much when
you tend to your above-ground garden


219
0:10:11,249 --> 0:10:13,93
it's okay if water leaks on thu fri
pallets


220
0:10:13,93 --> 0:10:19,5
craigslist always has dozens of pallets
for free i think the sizes forty inches


221
0:10:19,5 --> 0:10:21,5
by forty eight inches


222
0:10:21,5 --> 0:10:23,61
that's perfect for putting plans on them


223
0:10:23,61 --> 0:10:28,64
their isley accessible for maintenance
and picking ripe fruits and vegetables


224
0:10:28,64 --> 0:10:31,989
the level waterline is forty two inches
on mine


225
0:10:31,989 --> 0:10:34,62
and if the pallets are structured like
an h


226
0:10:34,62 --> 0:10:36,99
with the forty eight-inch side up


227
0:10:36,99 --> 0:10:41,42
and you have a garden area that's forty
eight inches high water will flow as


228
0:10:41,42 --> 0:10:45,59
long as the water level is forty two
inches or less


229
0:10:45,59 --> 0:10:50,36
put your shade plants on the shady side
and partial son plans where they get son


230
0:10:50,36 --> 0:10:51,55
part of the time


231
0:10:51,55 --> 0:10:54,56
in your full sun plants and full song


232
0:10:54,56 --> 0:10:58,19
i like several things about pallets one
they're free


233
0:10:58,19 --> 0:11:1,56
to they're plentiful and three their
versatile


234
0:11:1,56 --> 0:11:4,33
find them on craigslist under


235
0:11:4,33 --> 0:11:9,21
but four sale the categories for sale
and then free and know that sounds


236
0:11:9,21 --> 0:11:13,4
contradictory not for sale for free
they're just free


237
0:11:13,4 --> 0:11:15,8
that's where you find the category


238
0:11:15,8 --> 0:11:20,26
some places offer so many pallets you
can't carry them all in one trip


239
0:11:20,26 --> 0:11:22,52
some of the pallets are brand new


240
0:11:22,52 --> 0:11:24,74
who would still has a yellow color to it


241
0:11:24,74 --> 0:11:27,5
summerall been broken but it doesn't
matter


242
0:11:27,5 --> 0:11:28,61
you paint them


243
0:11:28,61 --> 0:11:32,52
put them together in the form of an h_
then put your plans are on a picture of


244
0:11:32,52 --> 0:11:33,8
water bottles on top


245
0:11:33,8 --> 0:11:37,27
some places have pallets available
everyday


246
0:11:37,27 --> 0:11:40,6
sometimes two or three available
everyday


247
0:11:40,6 --> 0:11:43,77
you could even take them apart in use
each piece of wood to build something


248
0:11:43,77 --> 0:11:46,28
special like uh... high bench


249
0:11:46,28 --> 0:11:50,39
mountain water drops to fall but not too
far because they will splash


250
0:11:50,39 --> 0:11:53,24
detailed scenes down there could splash
a seed


251
0:11:53,24 --> 0:11:55,68
out of its place and it won't route


252
0:11:55,68 --> 0:11:59,27
most loot and those pallets are made out
of hardwood


253
0:11:59,27 --> 0:12:2,9
hardwood means deciduous trees


254
0:12:2,9 --> 0:12:7,87
hardwood verses punted which is not a
deciduous tree it's an evergreen


255
0:12:7,87 --> 0:12:11,35
these palace don't look good in tiller
full of flowers are edible fruits and


256
0:12:11,35 --> 0:12:14,1
vegetables than everybody wants one


257
0:12:14,1 --> 0:12:18,42
no nothing i like about palaces they can
take your garden three-dimensional in no


258
0:12:18,42 --> 0:12:19,15
time


259
0:12:19,15 --> 0:12:21,27
you can roads powers of lettuce


260
0:12:21,27 --> 0:12:23,58
in a six-inch p_v_c_ pipe


261
0:12:23,58 --> 0:12:25,47
look at this let us power


262
0:12:25,47 --> 0:12:29,429
if you have a two-story house and a
bathroom on the second floor


263
0:12:29,429 --> 0:12:33,479
you can pull your water from the second
floor because it's pressurised to get up


264
0:12:33,479 --> 0:12:34,13
there


265
0:12:34,13 --> 0:12:36,58
then it flows down by gravity


266
0:12:36,58 --> 0:12:41,48
you could have lettuce towers taller
than a basketball hoop


267
0:12:41,48 --> 0:12:44,539
you know what the square foot gardeners
say about let us


268
0:12:44,539 --> 0:12:45,879
it gives you back


269
0:12:45,879 --> 0:12:49,18
sixteen dollars and twenty cents for
each


270
0:12:49,18 --> 0:12:50,24
square foot


271
0:12:50,24 --> 0:12:51,41
you plant


272
0:12:51,41 --> 0:12:54,429
it is one of the highest income plants


273
0:12:54,429 --> 0:12:57,74
there's no reason to pay a dollar twenty
nine for a head of lettuce


274
0:12:57,74 --> 0:12:59,93
when the save costs less than a penny


275
0:12:59,93 --> 0:13:2,999
does everyone on your block need less


276
0:13:2,999 --> 0:13:5,44
the chinese put lettuce and soups


277
0:13:5,44 --> 0:13:10,23
and it tastes great so try to get a
letter style or to increase the dollars


278
0:13:10,23 --> 0:13:13,25
per square foot that you're able to get
from your land


279
0:13:13,25 --> 0:13:14,93
the sky is the limit


280
0:13:14,93 --> 0:13:18,15
when you're getting sixteen dollars per
square foot you want to go as high as


281
0:13:18,15 --> 0:13:21,57
possible try to get thirty two dollars
per square foot for


282
0:13:21,57 --> 0:13:23,58
forty eight dollars per square foot


283
0:13:23,58 --> 0:13:27,649
because if you can get three times as
much less of a square foot


284
0:13:27,649 --> 0:13:32,57
one eight kirk and grow almost five
hundred thousand plants per acre


285
0:13:32,57 --> 0:13:37,65
instead of the normal one hundred and
fifty seven thousand plants per acre


286
0:13:37,65 --> 0:13:41,29
if let us sells for a dollar in the
store how much of a hundred and fifty


287
0:13:41,29 --> 0:13:43,65
seven thousand plans were


288
0:13:43,65 --> 0:13:46,389
a hundred and fifty seven thousand
dollars


289
0:13:46,389 --> 0:13:49,38
but let us is selling for more than a
dollar right now


290
0:13:49,38 --> 0:13:53,88
to make your ground could produce two
hundred thousand dollars worth of let us


291
0:13:53,88 --> 0:13:57,19
i'm not saying you're gonna wholesale it
at that price 'cause you're not you'd


292
0:13:57,19 --> 0:13:59,13
have to retail at


293
0:13:59,13 --> 0:14:1,11
we'll talk about that later


294
0:14:1,11 --> 0:14:3,68
prices have gone up on let us


295
0:14:3,68 --> 0:14:7,65
but issues to be fifty cents then it
went to a dollar and i said dollar for a


296
0:14:7,65 --> 0:14:9,41
love letter as a liberal my own


297
0:14:9,41 --> 0:14:11,19
now it's a dollar thirty


298
0:14:11,19 --> 0:14:14,269
and i think it'll be two dollars and
thirty cents and no time prices have


299
0:14:14,269 --> 0:14:18,89
gone up and they're going to go up much
higher because we are going to have


300
0:14:18,89 --> 0:14:22,899
hyperinflation now thanks to ben
bernanke e an entire game over there at


301
0:14:22,899 --> 0:14:25,51
the mafia i mean the uh... federal
reserve


302
0:14:25,51 --> 0:14:29,89
growing lettuce in towers and try to get
more than sixteen dollars per square


303
0:14:29,89 --> 0:14:29,76
foot


304
0:14:29,76 --> 0:14:31,32
it'll help with inflation


305
0:14:31,32 --> 0:14:34,129
and if there are elderly people on your
block


306
0:14:34,129 --> 0:14:38,55
and they're barely making ends meet give
them a gift of the head of lettuce


307
0:14:38,55 --> 0:14:41,25
it only cost you a penny to produce it


308
0:14:41,25 --> 0:14:44,86
unless you're able to sell at all but
uh... i don't think you can sell it all


309
0:14:44,86 --> 0:14:48,33
you might be able to grow more than you
can sell


310
0:14:48,33 --> 0:14:50,389
so spread a little goodwill


311
0:14:50,389 --> 0:14:51,829
and help the old people


312
0:14:51,829 --> 0:14:54,159
or anyone who's hungry for that matter


313
0:14:54,159 --> 0:14:58,24
nice to be able to give someone a dollar
that only cost you a penny


314
0:14:58,24 --> 0:15:2,21
when you give the older people head of
lettuce they might tell their family in


315
0:15:2,21 --> 0:15:5,18
the family might come over and buy from
you


316
0:15:5,18 --> 0:15:9,94
most of the cost of produce in the
stores transportation cost


317
0:15:9,94 --> 0:15:11,79
about ninety percent


318
0:15:11,79 --> 0:15:16,2
of the cost of anything in that proves
department is probably transportation


319
0:15:16,2 --> 0:15:19,31
cost if your customers come to you


320
0:15:19,31 --> 0:15:22,75
you get to pocket that ninety percent
you can sell below


321
0:15:22,75 --> 0:15:27,14
the store prices and still make more
profits in the store does


322
0:15:27,14 --> 0:15:28,55
without any overhead


323
0:15:28,55 --> 0:15:30,28
you're already living in your house


324
0:15:30,28 --> 0:15:31,529
give a big yard


325
0:15:31,529 --> 0:15:34,459
turnout yard into productive capacity


326
0:15:34,459 --> 0:15:37,749
him a little business built up when you
sell your house the business goes well


327
0:15:37,749 --> 0:15:41,6
the uh... who wouldn't buy a property
that makes a thousand dollars a month if


328
0:15:41,6 --> 0:15:44,1
the payments are only six hundred
dollars a month


329
0:15:44,1 --> 0:15:47,61
anybody would buy that house so you're
creating value here when you start


330
0:15:47,61 --> 0:15:49,9
planting seeds


331
0:15:49,9 --> 0:15:51,3
i'm gonna tell you where to buy seeds
later


332
0:15:51,3 --> 0:15:54,15
so if you're charging retail prices and
you have


333
0:15:54,15 --> 0:15:55,79
no delivery cost


334
0:15:55,79 --> 0:15:57,589
your customers come to you


335
0:15:57,589 --> 0:15:59,93
you really have a nice business


336
0:15:59,93 --> 0:16:3,1
it's almost under percent profit


337
0:16:3,1 --> 0:16:7,33
because the water costs are small the
seed costs of small in the sunshine is


338
0:16:7,33 --> 0:16:7,97
free


339
0:16:7,97 --> 0:16:12,73
your nefarious government has not figure
out how to charge you for sunshine


340
0:16:12,73 --> 0:16:13,879
but they will


341
0:16:13,879 --> 0:16:15,37
just a long time


342
0:16:15,37 --> 0:16:20,259
might develop a business of selling
ancillary products as well online now


343
0:16:20,259 --> 0:16:25,56
idea is a product called those violist's
when i washed let us and spinach in the


344
0:16:25,56 --> 0:16:26,49
silas


345
0:16:26,49 --> 0:16:29,67
it keeps in the refrigerator for a long
time 'cause it's not


346
0:16:29,67 --> 0:16:31,9
soaking in water


347
0:16:31,9 --> 0:16:35,62
socal edison water in the refrigerator
and it will turned brown than you


348
0:16:35,62 --> 0:16:39,86
you put it in as i listened spending
that throws all the water out and it


349
0:16:39,86 --> 0:16:44,5
falls to the bottom and let us is kept
above that would little basket plastic


350
0:16:44,5 --> 0:16:45,359
basket


351
0:16:45,359 --> 0:16:48,29
use google type in let us


352
0:16:48,29 --> 0:16:53,45
silas spinner silences e y l i s s


353
0:16:53,45 --> 0:16:58,62
with the wind ally at coldly medicine so
i was bender


354
0:16:58,62 --> 0:17:1,37
for about twenty dollars makes a nice
gift


355
0:17:1,37 --> 0:17:6,29
you know you can almost afford to give a
customer of twenty dollars islas


356
0:17:6,29 --> 0:17:10,389
for being a customer for ninety days
because you get ninety eight dollars


357
0:17:10,389 --> 0:17:12,22
let's say you're charging a dollar


358
0:17:12,22 --> 0:17:14,48
you get ninety dollars


359
0:17:14,48 --> 0:17:18,4
and they get twenty dollars plus alba
let us


360
0:17:18,4 --> 0:17:19,809
so it works for everybody


361
0:17:19,809 --> 0:17:21,12
you could subband


362
0:17:21,12 --> 0:17:26,15
system more you punchy carter something
that they have ninety purchases in


363
0:17:26,15 --> 0:17:30,399
ninety days you give them at twenty
dollars i loves for free


364
0:17:30,399 --> 0:17:33,629
with some of their customers will buy
everyday if they have kids they'll go


365
0:17:33,629 --> 0:17:35,77
through a head of lettuce everyday


366
0:17:35,77 --> 0:17:39,17
and if you're closer than the grocery
store they'll buy from you instead of


367
0:17:39,17 --> 0:17:41,87
the grocery store 'cause that's handy


368
0:17:41,87 --> 0:17:45,5
when the right now they tell go next
door and get the head of lettuce from


369
0:17:45,5 --> 0:17:47,169
that guy that grows them


370
0:17:47,169 --> 0:17:53,23
uh... with the toll powers i cut up let
us cucumbers and reddish and red onion


371
0:17:53,23 --> 0:17:54,33
who'll


372
0:17:54,33 --> 0:17:56,669
i put that on the silas and spend it


373
0:17:56,669 --> 0:18:0,22
and the seller is already made before
it's time to eat


374
0:18:0,22 --> 0:18:4,83
you lift that little in silence there's
your whole salad you see is the pinchers


375
0:18:4,83 --> 0:18:8,83
you pull out some put it on your plate
add your dressing yourselves ready


376
0:18:8,83 --> 0:18:10,97
before you can say what's to eat


377
0:18:10,97 --> 0:18:13,91
i like blue cheese dressing and feta
cheese with


378
0:18:13,91 --> 0:18:16,59
vinegar and all of loyal


379
0:18:16,59 --> 0:18:18,11
is that your stomach growling


380
0:18:18,11 --> 0:18:20,549
you're making me hungry


381
0:18:20,549 --> 0:18:24,6
okay so you have a hundred and fifty
seven thousand dollars from her a cure


382
0:18:24,6 --> 0:18:25,61
of ground


383
0:18:25,61 --> 0:18:28,26
that's if you plant on the ground


384
0:18:28,26 --> 0:18:30,25
but now you have the towers


385
0:18:30,25 --> 0:18:33,91
and you using the third dimension


386
0:18:33,91 --> 0:18:35,5
using left and right


387
0:18:35,5 --> 0:18:36,97
forward and backward


388
0:18:36,97 --> 0:18:39,24
and now using op


389
0:18:39,24 --> 0:18:40,47
multiplies


390
0:18:40,47 --> 0:18:42,49
the value of your land


391
0:18:42,49 --> 0:18:44,36
multiplies the use


392
0:18:44,36 --> 0:18:46,91
using that third dimension


393
0:18:46,91 --> 0:18:52,5
instead of one layer you've got two
three four who know six or seven layers


394
0:18:52,5 --> 0:18:54,97
offer one acre of ground


395
0:18:54,97 --> 0:18:59,25
look at these guys with their towers of
let us they're not fooling around


396
0:18:59,25 --> 0:19:3,19
they know the value of what they're
planting if you live in an apartment


397
0:19:3,19 --> 0:19:8,94
you can put the tower all your balcony
and go up several stories


398
0:19:8,94 --> 0:19:12,86
just make sure the towers out of the
reach of the guy who lives above you


399
0:19:12,86 --> 0:19:16,86
because the sixteen dollars per square
foot will be his not yours


400
0:19:16,86 --> 0:19:21,4
when you wanted to let us at the top of
the tower it trickles down like the


401
0:19:21,4 --> 0:19:22,37
economy


402
0:19:22,37 --> 0:19:23,7
you guys getting wet


403
0:19:23,7 --> 0:19:24,87
on the bottom layer


404
0:19:24,87 --> 0:19:26,39
in this economy


405
0:19:26,39 --> 0:19:29,94
sometimes i think those guys the topper
peeing on us down here


406
0:19:29,94 --> 0:19:32,409
anyway the water will fall from one
plant


407
0:19:32,409 --> 0:19:34,74
will trickle down to the next in the
next


408
0:19:34,74 --> 0:19:36,6
not on the water will be wasted


409
0:19:36,6 --> 0:19:40,1
those who plan on the ground will find
that the water that reaches the ground


410
0:19:40,1 --> 0:19:45,64
is good for growing parsley cilantro
basil oregano radishes or beats


411
0:19:45,64 --> 0:19:49,52
if you're able to increase the number of
heads of let us from one hundred and


412
0:19:49,52 --> 0:19:52,95
fifty seven thousand per acre to five
hundred thousand


413
0:19:52,95 --> 0:19:53,65
how much


414
0:19:53,65 --> 0:19:57,27
is five hundred thousand heads of
lettuce worth a dollar reach


415
0:19:57,27 --> 0:20:1,38
you could buy a jaguar and maybe pick up
chicks again you old fart


416
0:20:1,38 --> 0:20:5,37
let you go brush your teeth and look for
a girlfriend some people think it's cute


417
0:20:5,37 --> 0:20:7,419
to grow strawberries in the tower


418
0:20:7,419 --> 0:20:10,2
i found this image at wordpress dot com


419
0:20:10,2 --> 0:20:12,49
i'll give you the link in the
description


420
0:20:12,49 --> 0:20:16,409
because you tube doesn't allow you to
click on the link and go to war web page


421
0:20:16,409 --> 0:20:17,97
only videos


422
0:20:17,97 --> 0:20:23,299
so anyway growing strawberries in the
towers a nice idea and the birds love it


423
0:20:23,299 --> 0:20:27,419
they can't wait to you start offering
strawberries on the menu


424
0:20:27,419 --> 0:20:31,32
a bird can see a strawberry from three
miles away and they can smell it from


425
0:20:31,32 --> 0:20:33,7
forty miles


426
0:20:33,7 --> 0:20:36,1
good luck on your strawberry crop


427
0:20:36,1 --> 0:20:39,93
the strawberries the grow high on the
power will be eaten by birds and the


428
0:20:39,93 --> 0:20:43,259
laura ones will been bombed by the same
birds


429
0:20:43,259 --> 0:20:44,82
they have no manners


430
0:20:44,82 --> 0:20:48,14
they don't waste time looking for a
bathroom either


431
0:20:48,14 --> 0:20:51,51
anyplace below them is okay to dump
their ordinance


432
0:20:51,51 --> 0:20:54,11
you could be dressed in a suit birds
don't care


433
0:20:54,11 --> 0:20:56,45
i think they look for guys in suits


434
0:20:56,45 --> 0:20:58,2
me


435
0:20:58,2 --> 0:21:0,259
for birds dive bombing


436
0:21:0,259 --> 0:21:2,49
is covered from head to toe


437
0:21:2,49 --> 0:21:4,36
in excellent fertilizer


438
0:21:4,36 --> 0:21:6,73
a gift from heaven


439
0:21:6,73 --> 0:21:9,889
sometimes the guy in the senate is the
puppet president


440
0:21:9,889 --> 0:21:12,12
he gets what he deserves


441
0:21:12,12 --> 0:21:15,669
remember when bush was targeted back in
two thousand samad


442
0:21:15,669 --> 0:21:19,99
the c_i_a_ sentence perils during a mind
control test


443
0:21:19,99 --> 0:21:21,25
don't tell anyone


444
0:21:21,25 --> 0:21:25,22
it's still a secret but ronald arms felt
had a good laugh and sort of dickhead


445
0:21:25,22 --> 0:21:26,1
cheney


446
0:21:26,1 --> 0:21:29,49
these clowns who run the country give
bozo a bad name


447
0:21:29,49 --> 0:21:32,11
who my voting for romney or obama


448
0:21:32,11 --> 0:21:33,96
how about none of the above


449
0:21:33,96 --> 0:21:38,68
they need to read the constitution and
follow it to get my vote


450
0:21:38,68 --> 0:21:42,72
some of you have nice homes still you
haven't lost your jobs yet


451
0:21:42,72 --> 0:21:45,6
if you have an outdoor fire place like
this one


452
0:21:45,6 --> 0:21:47,899
those benches can be put to use


453
0:21:47,899 --> 0:21:52,289
they're designed for parties there's
plenty of room if you're giving a party


454
0:21:52,289 --> 0:21:55,6
but what do you do with those benches
the other ninety-nine point nine percent


455
0:21:55,6 --> 0:21:57,1
of the time


456
0:21:57,1 --> 0:21:58,779
you have to make use of them


457
0:21:58,779 --> 0:22:2,1
and also cut down your food bill by
growing your own


458
0:22:2,1 --> 0:22:5,789
there might come a day so when you
cannot get food in the food store


459
0:22:5,789 --> 0:22:10,419
growing your own will give you access to
food is not available to anyone else


460
0:22:10,419 --> 0:22:11,71
list they have a gun


461
0:22:11,71 --> 0:22:14,279
if the bench in your yard has the right
height


462
0:22:14,279 --> 0:22:18,34
water will flow right to it then no
changes are necessary but if the bench


463
0:22:18,34 --> 0:22:19,89
is too high


464
0:22:19,89 --> 0:22:22,299
just take a hammer and break off the
seat


465
0:22:22,299 --> 0:22:24,0
and see if that's any better


466
0:22:24,0 --> 0:22:27,69
when your wife sees it you know a bullet
holes in your fireplace to


467
0:22:27,69 --> 0:22:30,36
then you can run water lines through
that as well


468
0:22:30,36 --> 0:22:34,309
it might be nice to put out fires with
water instead of letting them burn out


469
0:22:34,309 --> 0:22:37,1
it solves the fire hazard problem


470
0:22:37,1 --> 0:22:38,59
some people have a railing


471
0:22:38,59 --> 0:22:41,3
and if you put your plans on both sides
of it


472
0:22:41,3 --> 0:22:43,11
you balance the load


473
0:22:43,11 --> 0:22:46,5
and the only thing you have to worry
about is the way


474
0:22:46,5 --> 0:22:49,95
you can use plant stands ventures made
of materials that will be affected by


475
0:22:49,95 --> 0:22:51,5
the constant water


476
0:22:51,5 --> 0:22:53,37
even a wrought iron bench


477
0:22:53,37 --> 0:22:56,88
if the hyde works out okay but if you
sent an advantage


478
0:22:56,88 --> 0:23:0,56
you might get your clothes weapon on the
water dripping nearby


479
0:23:0,56 --> 0:23:5,34
i'd prefer to put plants in the black
putting platt holders yelled about two


480
0:23:5,34 --> 0:23:9,61
gallons of potting soil if you buy them
there about a dollar reach


481
0:23:9,61 --> 0:23:14,19
but if you know landscaper who has
access to hundreds of them every month


482
0:23:14,19 --> 0:23:15,37
they can be free


483
0:23:15,37 --> 0:23:16,759
just suck up to him


484
0:23:16,759 --> 0:23:21,639
pelham al beautiful his landscaping is
and then ask for all has extra parts not


485
0:23:21,639 --> 0:23:23,69
on the same sentence of course


486
0:23:23,69 --> 0:23:27,32
space them out so he doesn't know he's
being conned


487
0:23:27,32 --> 0:23:28,87
let's review of the system


488
0:23:28,87 --> 0:23:33,409
reusing the automatically fill valve of
the toilet tank reservoir to refill the


489
0:23:33,409 --> 0:23:34,11
water


490
0:23:34,11 --> 0:23:35,39
as we use it


491
0:23:35,39 --> 0:23:37,19
outside on our plants


492
0:23:37,19 --> 0:23:39,88
the water levels forty two inches high


493
0:23:39,88 --> 0:23:44,1
and anytime you're below that water will
flow to u if you're above that water


494
0:23:44,1 --> 0:23:45,97
will flow in the opposite direction


495
0:23:45,97 --> 0:23:48,1
horrible stopped flowing


496
0:23:48,1 --> 0:23:51,12
and this full of water works anywhere on
your property


497
0:23:51,12 --> 0:23:55,149
even if you have forty acres you know
the holes that long where you can string


498
0:23:55,149 --> 0:23:59,809
together a bunch of moses you can
deliver water anywhere on your property


499
0:23:59,809 --> 0:24:1,529
with this method


500
0:24:1,529 --> 0:24:3,51
well you know it's a garden hose


501
0:24:3,51 --> 0:24:7,94
done installing elaborate system until
you make your first million for now just


502
0:24:7,94 --> 0:24:10,46
do it in the redneck style


503
0:24:10,46 --> 0:24:13,49
when you have half a million cash in a
new jaguar


504
0:24:13,49 --> 0:24:17,479
we can move out of your nineteen seventy
three mobile home with the leaky roof


505
0:24:17,479 --> 0:24:18,77
into a nice home


506
0:24:18,77 --> 0:24:22,61
you can put in underground water lines
in the new home


507
0:24:22,61 --> 0:24:24,89
we don't need electricity for the system


508
0:24:24,89 --> 0:24:26,44
water flows by gravity


509
0:24:26,44 --> 0:24:30,18
we don't need water pressure in the
siphon line water flows automatically


510
0:24:30,18 --> 0:24:32,53
from your toilet tank reservoir


511
0:24:32,53 --> 0:24:37,71
to anyplace that's lower anywhere on
your property it's like having a lake


512
0:24:37,71 --> 0:24:39,57
oren above-ground well


513
0:24:39,57 --> 0:24:42,26
that you created with a toilet tank
reservoir


514
0:24:42,26 --> 0:24:44,759
your waters always above ground


515
0:24:44,759 --> 0:24:49,7
and at the same level as your reservoir
and you spend nothing other than for the


516
0:24:49,7 --> 0:24:50,83
hose to deliver at their


517
0:24:50,83 --> 0:24:51,87
when you put your


518
0:24:51,87 --> 0:24:56,32
quarter-inch tubes in the hose and feed
your water bottles in the drip on the


519
0:24:56,32 --> 0:24:57,72
plant all day


520
0:24:57,72 --> 0:25:0,34
lift up the bottle that stops dripping


521
0:25:0,34 --> 0:25:2,549
laurette that starr stripping again


522
0:25:2,549 --> 0:25:4,38
pretty neat system


523
0:25:4,38 --> 0:25:8,1
if they are not shows in the back of
your toilet tank they might allow you to


524
0:25:8,1 --> 0:25:11,62
run a water line without disturbing the
balance of delivered


525
0:25:11,62 --> 0:25:12,89
on the reservoir


526
0:25:12,89 --> 0:25:14,89
or causing it to fall and break


527
0:25:14,89 --> 0:25:19,559
this diagram the outside reservoir
provides water to the soda bottles the


528
0:25:19,559 --> 0:25:21,81
soda bottles on the right


529
0:25:21,81 --> 0:25:25,82
all three tanks will be at the same
level the soda bottle the outside


530
0:25:25,82 --> 0:25:30,45
reservoir and the reservoir inside the
house the toilet tank reservoir as the


531
0:25:30,45 --> 0:25:32,88
water drips onto the plant


532
0:25:32,88 --> 0:25:35,29
the soda bottle loses water


533
0:25:35,29 --> 0:25:37,149
and his immediately replenished


534
0:25:37,149 --> 0:25:39,51
by the outside reservoir tank


535
0:25:39,51 --> 0:25:41,33
in it could be just a hose


536
0:25:41,33 --> 0:25:45,74
it's nice to have a tank because the
siphon hose will always replenish that


537
0:25:45,74 --> 0:25:47,539
tank when you draw from that


538
0:25:47,539 --> 0:25:51,679
tangle it's a it's a ten gallon tank you
draw from that that can recharge


539
0:25:51,679 --> 0:25:53,71
overnight if it needs to


540
0:25:53,71 --> 0:25:56,759
because you do have a limit to the
amount of water you can take


541
0:25:56,759 --> 0:25:59,169
through that quarter inch pipe in the
toilet tank


542
0:25:59,169 --> 0:26:2,89
i'm not sure you can do two thousand
plants might only be able to do the


543
0:26:2,89 --> 0:26:8,19
hundred plants or even fifty i'm not
sure haven't tested that i've got seven


544
0:26:8,19 --> 0:26:12,21
or eight plans when i get way too much
water already but i'm not planning to


545
0:26:12,21 --> 0:26:13,3
stick with


546
0:26:13,3 --> 0:26:17,17
six or eight plans when i have one in
the quarter ickes here i want to have at


547
0:26:17,17 --> 0:26:22,19
least two thousand plants all kinds i
can put five hundred


548
0:26:22,19 --> 0:26:24,0
h shaped palate


549
0:26:24,0 --> 0:26:24,97
structures


550
0:26:24,97 --> 0:26:30,13
uh... each one consists of three pallets
in the shape of an h for for balance


551
0:26:30,13 --> 0:26:31,409
instability


552
0:26:31,409 --> 0:26:34,7
they're tied together with uh... screws
i can put


553
0:26:34,7 --> 0:26:38,549
five hundred of those on one an accord
ickes of ground


554
0:26:38,549 --> 0:26:40,269
but if you want walking space


555
0:26:40,269 --> 0:26:41,83
then you can put that many


556
0:26:41,83 --> 0:26:45,9
but each one has eight plants so how
many do you need


557
0:26:45,9 --> 0:26:46,44
you don't need five hundred


558
0:26:46,44 --> 0:26:49,89
you'll need half that that gives a room
to walk around


559
0:26:49,89 --> 0:26:52,99
it also allows the bunny rabbit stew get
around in uh...


560
0:26:52,99 --> 0:26:57,389
uh... wild rabbits here so they like to
come in to eat and i want kodi's eating


561
0:26:57,389 --> 0:27:1,59
them because in the chance to run away
even it makes a little safer for them


562
0:27:1,59 --> 0:27:6,71
now since i have too much water flowing
i'd put a screw into the quarter inch


563
0:27:6,71 --> 0:27:7,409
pipe


564
0:27:7,409 --> 0:27:9,55
is they want in a half-inch


565
0:27:9,55 --> 0:27:10,49
screw


566
0:27:10,49 --> 0:27:15,5
that was already rusty my put it in that
tube in it is not a tight fit water


567
0:27:15,5 --> 0:27:18,549
still flows but if it was a lot slower


568
0:27:18,549 --> 0:27:21,179
so i have much fewer drips


569
0:27:21,179 --> 0:27:22,779
and it's just right for now


570
0:27:22,779 --> 0:27:23,649
later


571
0:27:23,649 --> 0:27:26,21
if i have two thousand plants


572
0:27:26,21 --> 0:27:29,269
i might want to stop watering the plans
that night


573
0:27:29,269 --> 0:27:30,389
when in school


574
0:27:30,389 --> 0:27:35,639
and allow my reservoir outside to fill
up a steady flow all day compensates for


575
0:27:35,639 --> 0:27:39,49
the sunshine in the heat who provides
the plant with enough water


576
0:27:39,49 --> 0:27:40,8
at night


577
0:27:40,8 --> 0:27:43,92
you really have too much water if you
give them the same amount of water at


578
0:27:43,92 --> 0:27:44,499
night


579
0:27:44,499 --> 0:27:47,49
so it's best to switch to replenishing


580
0:27:47,49 --> 0:27:49,36
your reservoir outside


581
0:27:49,36 --> 0:27:50,25
at night


582
0:27:50,25 --> 0:27:52,18
here's a different perspective


583
0:27:52,18 --> 0:27:55,1
of the drawing to illustrate the concept


584
0:27:55,1 --> 0:27:56,58
is a clear


585
0:27:56,58 --> 0:28:1,53
you're creating a large lake of sorts
with each soda bottle maintaining that


586
0:28:1,53 --> 0:28:2,6
same level


587
0:28:2,6 --> 0:28:4,68
as the inside reservoir


588
0:28:4,68 --> 0:28:8,37
and then that soda bottle is used to
drip water on the plants


589
0:28:8,37 --> 0:28:14,59
as long as all the soda bottles have a
siphon hose free of air water will rise


590
0:28:14,59 --> 0:28:18,7
over-the-top and provide water from
bottle to bottle to bottle per bottle


591
0:28:18,7 --> 0:28:21,149
you get water anywhere on your property


592
0:28:21,149 --> 0:28:25,929
there's a law that these sort of bottles
must maintain the same level of water


593
0:28:25,929 --> 0:28:28,65
and if they don't they go to jail
without bail


594
0:28:28,65 --> 0:28:30,409
if one of the bottles of the leak


595
0:28:30,409 --> 0:28:34,679
it's replenished that's the law i didn't
make of the law just using it to my own


596
0:28:34,679 --> 0:28:36,5
advantage


597
0:28:36,5 --> 0:28:38,409
i'd like to grow things and i live in
the desert


598
0:28:38,409 --> 0:28:42,96
so i need a solution and i don't believe
in buying thousands of dollars worth


599
0:28:42,96 --> 0:28:45,49
of timers and valves


600
0:28:45,49 --> 0:28:50,49
this would water delivered to my plants
this is the redneck solution that works


601
0:28:50,49 --> 0:28:53,409
it works in a very simple principle


602
0:28:53,409 --> 0:28:55,44
that water will seek its own level


603
0:28:55,44 --> 0:28:56,789
in all places


604
0:28:56,789 --> 0:29:0,679
if alba water bottles are connected with
the siphon hose


605
0:29:0,679 --> 0:29:4,58
remember that the water will flow from
your toilet tank to any spot on your


606
0:29:4,58 --> 0:29:6,23
property with a hose


607
0:29:6,23 --> 0:29:8,39
and it will seek the same height


608
0:29:8,39 --> 0:29:10,789
because of gravity and the weight of
water


609
0:29:10,789 --> 0:29:14,519
if water and wanting gets higher the
weight of the water will push the water


610
0:29:14,519 --> 0:29:19,19
through the hose until it all equalizers
like a leak


611
0:29:19,19 --> 0:29:21,77
it's an above-ground well


612
0:29:21,77 --> 0:29:25,94
drops of water falling on plans creates
a need for replenishing water


613
0:29:25,94 --> 0:29:30,75
and water will flow to raise the level
to where it was


614
0:29:30,75 --> 0:29:34,58
if you have a garden hose that runs two
hundred miles from your house


615
0:29:34,58 --> 0:29:39,59
and both films are up above the ground
sixty the water level will be the same


616
0:29:39,59 --> 0:29:42,769
at two hundred miles as it is in your
toilet tank


617
0:29:42,769 --> 0:29:47,929
if you put a quarter-inch siphon hose
into that garden hose you can siphon


618
0:29:47,929 --> 0:29:52,929
that water audra put on plans animal
automatically be replenished


619
0:29:52,929 --> 0:29:57,4
water will transfer from your toilet
tank to that garden hose and then the


620
0:29:57,4 --> 0:29:58,51
water flow will stop


621
0:29:58,51 --> 0:29:59,44
until you start


622
0:29:59,44 --> 0:30:0,24
dripping


623
0:30:0,24 --> 0:30:1,59
on plans


624
0:30:1,59 --> 0:30:6,0
depleting the water in your hose and
then it will be automatically


625
0:30:6,0 --> 0:30:7,12
replenished


626
0:30:7,12 --> 0:30:9,5
by the toilet tank


627
0:30:9,5 --> 0:30:13,2
now you probably already knew that but
how many people ever use that knowledge


628
0:30:13,2 --> 0:30:15,789
to water the plants very few


629
0:30:15,789 --> 0:30:18,869
and the reason is because they have
florian and their drinking water


630
0:30:18,869 --> 0:30:21,7
and their dumber than a darned doughnut


631
0:30:21,7 --> 0:30:25,8
if you saw if in water out of your
garden hose to water your plants even


632
0:30:25,8 --> 0:30:29,88
two hundred miles away what happened to
the level of the water and that holds


633
0:30:29,88 --> 0:30:31,179
it drops


634
0:30:31,179 --> 0:30:35,55
in the water you removed is replaced by
the toyota take reservoir


635
0:30:35,55 --> 0:30:38,72
thousands of players getting a drop of
water now on them


636
0:30:38,72 --> 0:30:42,23
as long as you're taking the water from
the garden hose it's going to be


637
0:30:42,23 --> 0:30:43,369
replenished


638
0:30:43,369 --> 0:30:47,679
but you will reach a point at which they
one quarter-inch siphon hose can't keep


639
0:30:47,679 --> 0:30:49,82
up with your water use


640
0:30:49,82 --> 0:30:52,21
and then you're going to have to limit
the system


641
0:30:52,21 --> 0:30:56,659
but it's okay to use the system for a
small garden of twenty or thirty plants


642
0:30:56,659 --> 0:30:58,379
i've got five trees


643
0:30:58,379 --> 0:30:59,7
to palm trees


644
0:30:59,7 --> 0:31:0,74
nectarines


645
0:31:0,74 --> 0:31:3,36
a mandarin orange and a lemon tree


646
0:31:3,36 --> 0:31:4,779
plus about six


647
0:31:4,779 --> 0:31:9,66
plants and thousands of seeds have been
planted i'm waiting for them the sprout


648
0:31:9,66 --> 0:31:12,159
i think i can supply all of those


649
0:31:12,159 --> 0:31:13,46
with plenty of water


650
0:31:13,46 --> 0:31:17,159
using a ketchup bottle the whole is just
perfect


651
0:31:17,159 --> 0:31:21,33
you put your quarter inch hose in that
whole it fits perfectly


652
0:31:21,33 --> 0:31:24,95
i was going to poke a hole in the
ketchup bottle but it's terrific


653
0:31:24,95 --> 0:31:27,289
it's extremely thick


654
0:31:27,289 --> 0:31:30,21
are used in the land i broke the needle
three times


655
0:31:30,21 --> 0:31:31,22
so i quit


656
0:31:31,22 --> 0:31:33,3
round needles


657
0:31:33,3 --> 0:31:36,309
now i just loose on the capital are
flows over the top


658
0:31:36,309 --> 0:31:40,13
just keeping ketchup bottle lower than
the old water level


659
0:31:40,13 --> 0:31:44,2
when you go to the store to buy holds
bring the ketchup bottle with you


660
0:31:44,2 --> 0:31:48,969
contests that see if it fits in that
whole in my case it's tighter than o_j_


661
0:31:48,969 --> 0:31:50,84
simpson's gloves


662
0:31:50,84 --> 0:31:53,19
and since johnnie cochran is dead


663
0:31:53,19 --> 0:31:54,8
there's no need to fake the fifth


664
0:31:54,8 --> 0:31:56,46
so the jury will acquit


665
0:31:56,46 --> 0:31:59,58
johnnie cochran denied justice to you
and me


666
0:31:59,58 --> 0:32:2,26
made a buck and allowed the killer to go
free


667
0:32:2,26 --> 0:32:5,32
for those murders justice certainly did
fail


668
0:32:5,32 --> 0:32:9,49
that o_j_ committed another crime and
today he's in jail


669
0:32:9,49 --> 0:32:12,63
the moral of the story is one to which i
can attest


670
0:32:12,63 --> 0:32:15,5
he who runs last rhymes best


671
0:32:15,5 --> 0:32:17,0
johnnie cochran


672
0:32:17,0 --> 0:32:18,69
all right p


673
0:32:18,69 --> 0:32:20,98
but besides the tight fit


674
0:32:20,98 --> 0:32:25,529
and the whole of the catcher bob is
another advantage to catch a bottles


675
0:32:25,529 --> 0:32:28,929
when you want to stop the flow of water
users raised to catch a bottle


676
0:32:28,929 --> 0:32:31,44
the water stops flowing into it


677
0:32:31,44 --> 0:32:35,37
so you got your forty two inch level
line for all water


678
0:32:35,37 --> 0:32:38,2
toilet tank in the entire property


679
0:32:38,2 --> 0:32:41,8
after property drops a foot and you have
to add a foot


680
0:32:41,8 --> 0:32:43,4
to that water level line because


681
0:32:43,4 --> 0:32:47,45
that toilet tank doesn't know you have
property that drops a foot


682
0:32:47,45 --> 0:32:51,12
that's going to maintain that water
level at the same height


683
0:32:51,12 --> 0:32:52,739
altitude above


684
0:32:52,739 --> 0:32:54,2
the center of the earth


685
0:32:54,2 --> 0:32:58,46
so you might wind up with a gusher if
your property drops forty feet


686
0:32:58,46 --> 0:33:2,8
might have water spewing out there with
a column of water forty feet high and


687
0:33:2,8 --> 0:33:3,9
it's a pretty good pressure


688
0:33:3,9 --> 0:33:6,35
so the system isn't gonna work like that


689
0:33:6,35 --> 0:33:10,13
now if you raise the ketchup bottle at
night to turn off the water when you


690
0:33:10,13 --> 0:33:13,299
lower in the morning to start the flow
again


691
0:33:13,299 --> 0:33:15,15
it's redneck but it works


692
0:33:15,15 --> 0:33:17,85
and you didn't spend any money and you
had some fun


693
0:33:17,85 --> 0:33:20,11
that's how you got the bullet holes
remember


694
0:33:20,11 --> 0:33:23,219
count the seconds between jobs and if
it's too much


695
0:33:23,219 --> 0:33:27,99
running for awhile didn't give it a rest
you can punch a hole in the sort of all


696
0:33:27,99 --> 0:33:27,799
too


697
0:33:27,799 --> 0:33:31,8
but the whole is too large put something
in the hole to cover it


698
0:33:31,8 --> 0:33:34,32
some people might want to use a penny to
slow down the flow


699
0:33:34,32 --> 0:33:38,87
sometimes watersports also fasted
squirts over into the next plant and you


700
0:33:38,87 --> 0:33:42,13
don't get any water in the plant below
them the bottle


701
0:33:42,13 --> 0:33:45,97
so the penny can help you there too but
if you use a penny it's going to cost


702
0:33:45,97 --> 0:33:50,299
you a penny and someone might see the
pain still it by collected six dollars


703
0:33:50,299 --> 0:33:52,919
that we want i'm man that guy was mad


704
0:33:52,919 --> 0:33:57,87
as water bill went up to a thousand
dollars and all has plants died


705
0:33:57,87 --> 0:33:59,37
was my fault


706
0:33:59,37 --> 0:34:2,159
who put the pennies there in the first
place


707
0:34:2,159 --> 0:34:3,899
entrapment


708
0:34:3,899 --> 0:34:6,71
now that guy uses foreign koreans


709
0:34:6,71 --> 0:34:9,209
and only foreigners steelers pennies


710
0:34:9,209 --> 0:34:11,389
so the problem was almost solved


711
0:34:11,389 --> 0:34:15,389
now all we have to do is get rid of the
foreigners and the problem is solved


712
0:34:15,389 --> 0:34:18,6
problem with that is america's all
foreigners


713
0:34:18,6 --> 0:34:20,299
except in need of atlantans


714
0:34:20,299 --> 0:34:23,829
who were kicked out by the native
americans because the native americans


715
0:34:23,829 --> 0:34:26,929
had advanced weaponry bows and arrows


716
0:34:26,929 --> 0:34:27,929
icalendar


717
0:34:27,929 --> 0:34:29,8
and the number zero


718
0:34:29,8 --> 0:34:33,99
they had a superior culture 'cause they
could come past nine within zero


719
0:34:33,99 --> 0:34:37,619
so they took over in the atlanta games
had to find another place to live than


720
0:34:37,619 --> 0:34:41,99
their island sunk and that was the end
of them


721
0:34:41,99 --> 0:34:43,109
let's talk about the value of the crop


722
0:34:43,109 --> 0:34:46,6
when you go to the store to buy produce


723
0:34:46,6 --> 0:34:49,679
u_p_ retail prices which includes what
the farmer gets


724
0:34:49,679 --> 0:34:51,529
with the truck drivers get


725
0:34:51,529 --> 0:34:55,869
there's insurance involved in gasoline
and diesel you have to pay those who


726
0:34:55,869 --> 0:34:58,6
sell insurance nova


727
0:34:58,6 --> 0:35:2,9
store with employees in renton air
conditioning electricity in maintenance


728
0:35:2,9 --> 0:35:6,68
and more insurance and taxes and on and
on and on a whole lot of middle man


729
0:35:6,68 --> 0:35:8,52
if you're on a fixed income


730
0:35:8,52 --> 0:35:12,81
you want to buy the seats in the water
and that's that no middleman you can


731
0:35:12,81 --> 0:35:14,32
afford middlemen


732
0:35:14,32 --> 0:35:16,6
retail prices are too high


733
0:35:16,6 --> 0:35:20,25
because of all the middleman there's
nothing you can do about it except grow


734
0:35:20,25 --> 0:35:21,199
your own


735
0:35:21,199 --> 0:35:23,4
pay them or grow your own


736
0:35:23,4 --> 0:35:25,699
cozier only two choices


737
0:35:25,699 --> 0:35:32,16
here's an ad look at this they want four
dollars for half a pound bag of swiss


738
0:35:32,16 --> 0:35:32,9
hillard


739
0:35:32,9 --> 0:35:34,119
salad mix


740
0:35:34,119 --> 0:35:36,71
four dollars for a half a pound


741
0:35:36,71 --> 0:35:37,99
can you afford it


742
0:35:37,99 --> 0:35:40,579
dollars a pound for greens


743
0:35:40,579 --> 0:35:42,6
state maybe


744
0:35:42,6 --> 0:35:44,57
you can buy a new york street for that
kind of money


745
0:35:44,57 --> 0:35:47,639
can you get a fully mignon for eight
dollars a pound


746
0:35:47,639 --> 0:35:52,899
i'll grow my own swiss chard then i can
afford fully manual how about you


747
0:35:52,899 --> 0:35:57,679
greens you can grow out of your toilet
tank reservoir and i just proved it if


748
0:35:57,679 --> 0:36:1,91
you're going to be the man with all the
produce everyone is going to like you


749
0:36:1,91 --> 0:36:5,15
they're gonna suck up to you lyn you
sucked up to that landscaper


750
0:36:5,15 --> 0:36:6,8
they're going to be flattering euro


751
0:36:6,8 --> 0:36:8,84
you're gonna know you're getting conned


752
0:36:8,84 --> 0:36:13,82
so watch out for the people who try to
kanya if you give away free produce to


753
0:36:13,82 --> 0:36:18,65
anybody friend neighbor co-worker at
cetera you'll never be able to sell them


754
0:36:18,65 --> 0:36:19,569
anything


755
0:36:19,569 --> 0:36:22,699
were turned them into a pain customer


756
0:36:22,699 --> 0:36:27,159
now i mention giving away things to
people that are very poor and i still


757
0:36:27,159 --> 0:36:28,25
believe in that


758
0:36:28,25 --> 0:36:31,45
we don't want anybody to starve to death
if we can't help it


759
0:36:31,45 --> 0:36:35,95
for something that you can give them
tomato that didn't shape right or has a


760
0:36:35,95 --> 0:36:40,47
spot on it birds heated they can cut
that part often use the rest


761
0:36:40,47 --> 0:36:43,68
sister ways for you except for the
c_d_c_'s are worth more than the


762
0:36:43,68 --> 0:36:48,589
terminal built by the way so when you
have regular customers you don't want to


763
0:36:48,589 --> 0:36:53,22
give them away things free directly
because they'll never pay for something


764
0:36:53,22 --> 0:36:57,499
they got free they expect at the same
way they got last time free


765
0:36:57,499 --> 0:37:1,49
a handout and many of them will get
friendlier than a column and when they


766
0:37:1,49 --> 0:37:3,94
see that you have something of value
that they want


767
0:37:3,94 --> 0:37:5,469
besides the pennies


768
0:37:5,469 --> 0:37:8,15
so i wanted to know establish that the
product


769
0:37:8,15 --> 0:37:12,26
has a price tag you give them a coupon
for a discount


770
0:37:12,26 --> 0:37:14,919
or a coupon for a small sample


771
0:37:14,919 --> 0:37:16,8
not a normal portion


772
0:37:16,8 --> 0:37:19,849
given three dollars off on a five dollar
purchase


773
0:37:19,849 --> 0:37:24,169
you'll still have a profit because
produce is that profitable the scenes


774
0:37:24,169 --> 0:37:26,299
cost less than a penny and each


775
0:37:26,299 --> 0:37:28,44
head of lettuce is worth more than a
dollar


776
0:37:28,44 --> 0:37:34,159
but you're not in business to provide
charity in all cases just occasionally


777
0:37:34,159 --> 0:37:36,49
you put in ad on craigslist


778
0:37:36,49 --> 0:37:38,75
pick your own farm people really like
that


779
0:37:38,75 --> 0:37:41,89
you might go to a few in your own
neighborhood


780
0:37:41,89 --> 0:37:43,399
your own city


781
0:37:43,399 --> 0:37:45,49
just to see what they're like


782
0:37:45,49 --> 0:37:46,459
see what they charge


783
0:37:46,459 --> 0:37:48,44
see how many customers they have


784
0:37:48,44 --> 0:37:52,29
see what they're growing and selling
because if they don't have let us and


785
0:37:52,29 --> 0:37:53,319
you grow let us


786
0:37:53,319 --> 0:37:55,369
you have a monopoly on let us


787
0:37:55,369 --> 0:37:58,529
but if everyone's growing and selling
let us they're selling it for fifty


788
0:37:58,529 --> 0:38:1,2
cents you might steer away from lattice


789
0:38:1,2 --> 0:38:5,2
asking if they have any radishes or
aruba but u wanna know what your


790
0:38:5,2 --> 0:38:8,21
competition is doing what people are
already buying


791
0:38:8,21 --> 0:38:12,61
but developing regular customers is good
because the scenes costs you almost


792
0:38:12,61 --> 0:38:16,389
nothing in the water costs almost
nothing


793
0:38:16,389 --> 0:38:18,94
the fertilizer costs almost nothing


794
0:38:18,94 --> 0:38:23,17
compared to the value of the produce
when it's ready for market you're


795
0:38:23,17 --> 0:38:28,47
putting your time into growing these
things you're setting up these pallets


796
0:38:28,47 --> 0:38:32,33
it costs money to go get them at cost
money to put them together takes time to


797
0:38:32,33 --> 0:38:35,9
put them together you've got to be
compensated for that we can't just be


798
0:38:35,9 --> 0:38:39,68
giving away free produced everybody who
comes along and people wrote to me and


799
0:38:39,68 --> 0:38:44,49
said it aya planted a hundred season
they all grew tomatoes and i give away


800
0:38:44,49 --> 0:38:48,9
forty plants cuz my yard with only
accommodate sixty plans


801
0:38:48,9 --> 0:38:52,2
somebody who gave away forty plants is
going to be popular


802
0:38:52,2 --> 0:38:56,44
but next year at the same people expect
the free gift again i think the guy only


803
0:38:56,44 --> 0:39:1,19
plan sixty plans next time because he
doesn't need it maybe he'll be able to


804
0:39:1,19 --> 0:39:4,79
sell the produce that comes from sixty
tomato plants


805
0:39:4,79 --> 0:39:9,359
each tomato plants going to give him
about ten pounds of tomatoes that means


806
0:39:9,359 --> 0:39:10,369
he's going to have


807
0:39:10,369 --> 0:39:14,89
six hundred pounds of tomatoes and i
don't think you can use that many unless


808
0:39:14,89 --> 0:39:16,909
he's scanning them


809
0:39:16,909 --> 0:39:20,799
but that's a lot of pizzas in a lot of
spaghetti and a lot of lasagna and


810
0:39:20,799 --> 0:39:21,92
ravioli


811
0:39:21,92 --> 0:39:27,679
must have jo lee and all those other all
these


812
0:39:27,679 --> 0:39:30,65
but you will quickly figure out that
this


813
0:39:30,65 --> 0:39:31,93
israel money


814
0:39:31,93 --> 0:39:37,849
and that fiat currency has used only to
pay bills you swap your produce for that


815
0:39:37,849 --> 0:39:40,44
stuff and use it to pay off a credit
card


816
0:39:40,44 --> 0:39:45,9
or use it to buy gasoline you
immediately convert that fiat currency


817
0:39:45,9 --> 0:39:47,329
into gasoline for your gas tank


818
0:39:47,329 --> 0:39:49,71
then your gas tank is always full


819
0:39:49,71 --> 0:39:54,69
of gas and if you have extra money it
wouldn't hurt to have a gasoline tank on


820
0:39:54,69 --> 0:39:58,829
your property and filled out full of
gasoline case electricity goes off cuz i


821
0:39:58,829 --> 0:40:1,359
expect that the electricity will go off


822
0:40:1,359 --> 0:40:1,98
in about


823
0:40:1,98 --> 0:40:6,67
half of the country soon that fiat
currency could become worthless


824
0:40:6,67 --> 0:40:11,34
overnight because everyone stops
accepting it and they want realmoney


825
0:40:11,34 --> 0:40:12,47
lakes older


826
0:40:12,47 --> 0:40:13,52
you can sell


827
0:40:13,52 --> 0:40:18,95
tomatoes for ten cents a pound if they
use silver coins an old i'm slop that


828
0:40:18,95 --> 0:40:23,23
for a pound of tomatoes that's a good
deal you pile up the silver you swap


829
0:40:23,23 --> 0:40:28,539
your tomatoes or peppers or let us for
silver coins that's a great deal


830
0:40:28,539 --> 0:40:32,739
misty eyed currency really has no value
but as long as other people are stupid


831
0:40:32,739 --> 0:40:34,27
enough to accept it


832
0:40:34,27 --> 0:40:38,88
then we got a game going everybody's
accepting a fiat currency all it is is a


833
0:40:38,88 --> 0:40:40,5
place marker


834
0:40:40,5 --> 0:40:45,609
it has no value it's not redeemable for
anything unless other people go along


835
0:40:45,609 --> 0:40:46,809
with the game


836
0:40:46,809 --> 0:40:49,349
but at some point the game is going to
be over


837
0:40:49,349 --> 0:40:53,519
the banks are going to close nephew i
currency will be worthless


838
0:40:53,519 --> 0:40:56,68
and we're reaching that with
hyperinflation anyway you'll need a


839
0:40:56,68 --> 0:41:0,839
wheelbarrow just to buy a loaf of bread
would be a trillion dollars for a low


840
0:41:0,839 --> 0:41:1,66
for brad


841
0:41:1,66 --> 0:41:4,3
that's what happens at the end of
currency


842
0:41:4,3 --> 0:41:7,16
this currency is overdue for collapse


843
0:41:7,16 --> 0:41:10,989
most fiat currencies last something like
twenty eight years


844
0:41:10,989 --> 0:41:14,489
when nixon ended in nineteen seventy
eight i think


845
0:41:14,489 --> 0:41:18,99
he took us off the gold standard in
nineteen seventy three eight and we are


846
0:41:18,99 --> 0:41:22,19
overdue there were some things put in
place they forced the whole world to


847
0:41:22,19 --> 0:41:27,13
deal in dollars prolong the life of this
currency to this currency has reached


848
0:41:27,13 --> 0:41:28,879
the end of its life


849
0:41:28,879 --> 0:41:33,589
don't stack up a lot of dollars in the
bank especially


850
0:41:33,589 --> 0:41:38,289
be better to own scenes or something
that won't go bad seasonal get all the


851
0:41:38,289 --> 0:41:42,249
reward sprout anymore motion freeze them
i'm not even sure you can freeze all


852
0:41:42,249 --> 0:41:45,859
sees maybe some along are killed by
freezing i don't know


853
0:41:45,859 --> 0:41:50,939
some countries are already refusing
dollars especially those printed at a


854
0:41:50,939 --> 0:41:53,18
certain date after a certain date


855
0:41:53,18 --> 0:41:56,99
because they know what ben bernanke in
the mafia i mean the federal reserve are


856
0:41:56,99 --> 0:41:57,619
doing


857
0:41:57,619 --> 0:42:0,869
they know they're counterfeiting u_s_
currency and their euphemistically


858
0:42:0,869 --> 0:42:4,58
calling it cute he won and q_e_ two


859
0:42:4,58 --> 0:42:10,39
quantitative easing is a euphemism for
counterfeiting the currency


860
0:42:10,39 --> 0:42:15,7
it's a crime against anyone who held
those worthless u_s_ notes or save money


861
0:42:15,7 --> 0:42:21,59
over the years or bought life insurance
or bought church three bills and burned


862
0:42:21,59 --> 0:42:24,7
and canada's crux got away with it he
should be imprisoned


863
0:42:24,7 --> 0:42:29,49
along with those who own the federal
reserve a group of nazi bankers who are


864
0:42:29,49 --> 0:42:33,89
intent on robbing us blind and they're
doing so at the rate of forty eight


865
0:42:33,89 --> 0:42:36,96
million dollars an hour twenty four
hours a day right through the holidays


866
0:42:36,96 --> 0:42:41,759
and weekends seven days a week they rob
us of forty eight million dollars an


867
0:42:41,759 --> 0:42:42,329
hour


868
0:42:42,329 --> 0:42:46,259
that's what we pay the interest on the
national debt than most of the national


869
0:42:46,259 --> 0:42:51,47
debt came from interest charged on money
they didn't let me just printed it


870
0:42:51,47 --> 0:42:53,589
sore robbery of the u_n_ me


871
0:42:53,589 --> 0:42:57,409
your job is to spread the true tell
others live video of your own just


872
0:42:57,409 --> 0:43:1,429
record your voice and tell us what you
think that's what we all have to do this


873
0:43:1,429 --> 0:43:4,859
long because were permitted to do so we
need to do so


874
0:43:4,859 --> 0:43:8,709
nazis are not going to allow us that
freedom much longer to see you better


875
0:43:8,709 --> 0:43:10,39
get busy now


876
0:43:10,39 --> 0:43:12,72
this is a war against the slave masters


877
0:43:12,72 --> 0:43:17,299
and we need to be free okay so people
come into your place of business to buy


878
0:43:17,299 --> 0:43:18,16
from you


879
0:43:18,16 --> 0:43:21,94
you collect their name address phone
number email address and when you have


880
0:43:21,94 --> 0:43:26,959
something they like you notify them you
ask them ask if you have any radishes no


881
0:43:26,959 --> 0:43:30,469
should i call you when i have some yes
would you do that i'll send you an email


882
0:43:30,469 --> 0:43:31,41
of the automatic


883
0:43:31,41 --> 0:43:37,229
so soon as you have rashes or let us
look tomatoes are peppers or squash or


884
0:43:37,229 --> 0:43:40,25
whatever we send an email and so i have
what you want


885
0:43:40,25 --> 0:43:42,71
coming at it you could even take a nice
picture


886
0:43:42,71 --> 0:43:45,719
chill in the quality of your produce


887
0:43:45,719 --> 0:43:48,5
if you're worried about people picking
your own


888
0:43:48,5 --> 0:43:51,36
you can have it already picked in bags
and they get there you have fired attend


889
0:43:51,36 --> 0:43:55,67
available all the time they're not going
to die if you pick them in a store for a


890
0:43:55,67 --> 0:43:59,599
few hours if you don't sell them pick
last the next day


891
0:43:59,599 --> 0:44:3,519
okay so we talked about advertising
under farm and garden on craig's list to


892
0:44:3,519 --> 0:44:6,839
develop your customers we talked about
sending out notices


893
0:44:6,839 --> 0:44:10,829
now want to talk about the growing
season in arizona i created this list


894
0:44:10,829 --> 0:44:12,48
and you have to do it for your state


895
0:44:12,48 --> 0:44:16,17
look at all of the things you want to
grow look at the planting time in the


896
0:44:16,17 --> 0:44:17,47
harvest time


897
0:44:17,47 --> 0:44:22,14
then create a calendar for planting and
another calendar for harvesting i do it


898
0:44:22,14 --> 0:44:25,78
on a spreadsheet let us was reading in
twenty eight days and it's worth a


899
0:44:25,78 --> 0:44:26,49
dollar


900
0:44:26,49 --> 0:44:31,67
so you can turn up any into a dollar in
a month lettuce seeds can do that for


901
0:44:31,67 --> 0:44:35,329
you it's magic turn a penny into a
dollar and a month


902
0:44:35,329 --> 0:44:37,93
actually it's less than a penny i'd pay


903
0:44:37,93 --> 0:44:43,23
about thirteen cents for a hundred seeds
i get seven hundred and ninety one


904
0:44:43,23 --> 0:44:45,599
scenes for a dollar


905
0:44:45,599 --> 0:44:50,29
it's almost eight seats for a penny if
only half of them germany i get


906
0:44:50,29 --> 0:44:53,249
four plants for a penny


907
0:44:53,249 --> 0:44:56,59
we have four dollars back for one penny


908
0:44:56,59 --> 0:44:56,99
invested


909
0:44:56,99 --> 0:44:57,94
in the seed


910
0:44:57,94 --> 0:44:59,489
and i've got water costs


911
0:44:59,489 --> 0:45:1,88
i got a gasoline cost in my time


912
0:45:1,88 --> 0:45:3,369
but what does the growth rate


913
0:45:3,369 --> 0:45:4,84
he only got a penny


914
0:45:4,84 --> 0:45:8,47
if you have a cost of a penny and you
get an a dollar back in a month


915
0:45:8,47 --> 0:45:11,98
that seven hundred and seventy two
percent growth of your money in one


916
0:45:11,98 --> 0:45:15,3
month that's nine thousand percent
growth


917
0:45:15,3 --> 0:45:19,98
in a year now let us matures in twenty
eight days so how many times can you


918
0:45:19,98 --> 0:45:24,81
multiply your money in the year it's a
three followed by sixty one zero zero


919
0:45:24,81 --> 0:45:26,1
zero for that


920
0:45:26,1 --> 0:45:28,83
a billion billion billion billion
billion billion


921
0:45:28,83 --> 0:45:31,6
what arcade in october


922
0:45:31,6 --> 0:45:32,89
november


923
0:45:32,89 --> 0:45:34,509
december and january


924
0:45:34,509 --> 0:45:39,29
these other crops i can grow of all the
crops i want to grow and arizona in


925
0:45:39,29 --> 0:45:39,9
october


926
0:45:39,9 --> 0:45:41,9
i'm limited to lettuce


927
0:45:41,9 --> 0:45:42,77
turnouts


928
0:45:42,77 --> 0:45:43,88
radishes


929
0:45:43,88 --> 0:45:45,24
swiss chard


930
0:45:45,24 --> 0:45:47,119
celery and peas


931
0:45:47,119 --> 0:45:48,5
bolt onions


932
0:45:48,5 --> 0:45:50,879
brussel sprouts and carrots


933
0:45:50,879 --> 0:45:53,519
spinach parsley and beats


934
0:45:53,519 --> 0:45:54,5
kohlrabi


935
0:45:54,5 --> 0:45:55,32
broccoli


936
0:45:55,32 --> 0:45:56,65
and collar flower


937
0:45:56,65 --> 0:45:58,57
cabbage rue the day is


938
0:45:58,57 --> 0:46:1,38
and uh... par snaps bunching onions


939
0:46:1,38 --> 0:46:3,199
and salon show


940
0:46:3,199 --> 0:46:5,459
and i'm very disappointed about that


941
0:46:5,459 --> 0:46:10,479
in november celery drops out and
potatoes current season


942
0:46:10,479 --> 0:46:12,959
something you should know about potatoes


943
0:46:12,959 --> 0:46:15,97
potatoes indeed and acidic soil


944
0:46:15,97 --> 0:46:18,559
this means low ph


945
0:46:18,559 --> 0:46:21,759
arizona's soil is high ph


946
0:46:21,759 --> 0:46:24,919
and so i'm not planting any potatoes
here


947
0:46:24,919 --> 0:46:28,629
the plants can't absorb nutrients from
the soil


948
0:46:28,629 --> 0:46:29,98
and the fertilizer


949
0:46:29,98 --> 0:46:32,499
so i stay away from potatoes


950
0:46:32,499 --> 0:46:36,709
i bought potatoes today for twenty cents
a pound at safeway


951
0:46:36,709 --> 0:46:42,359
they had a five pound bag for a dollar
so i bought fifteen pounds of potatoes


952
0:46:42,359 --> 0:46:45,68
because the bunnies overhaul potatoes


953
0:46:45,68 --> 0:46:50,339
don't see it too loud because when i
cook french fries they come around and


954
0:46:50,339 --> 0:46:53,19
wait for potato skins


955
0:46:53,19 --> 0:46:56,42
sometimes i cut up for ralph potato and
give it to them


956
0:46:56,42 --> 0:47:0,419
i don't want to spoil them like i did
with the bananas


957
0:47:0,419 --> 0:47:3,569
because d treat me very badly


958
0:47:3,569 --> 0:47:7,289
you remember the swiss chard for eight
dollars a pound


959
0:47:7,289 --> 0:47:9,299
i like the way it looks too


960
0:47:9,299 --> 0:47:10,44
fast growth


961
0:47:10,44 --> 0:47:12,779
high-value crops only


962
0:47:12,779 --> 0:47:15,9
that's the way you get the silver


963
0:47:15,9 --> 0:47:16,989
to float to you


964
0:47:16,989 --> 0:47:19,249
you see those prices


965
0:47:19,249 --> 0:47:23,809
that's how much the square foot
gardeners and getting from these crops


966
0:47:23,809 --> 0:47:28,4
and it's a good idea to plant the
highest value crops so you can swap them


967
0:47:28,4 --> 0:47:30,2
for the most silver


968
0:47:30,2 --> 0:47:34,9
if you're growing crops for your own you
should plan and what you eat


969
0:47:34,9 --> 0:47:38,619
if you're providing food for others you
assess what they need or want


970
0:47:38,619 --> 0:47:41,119
and by implant those crops


971
0:47:41,119 --> 0:47:45,729
if you're doing this for money the new
supplier only the most lucrative crops


972
0:47:45,729 --> 0:47:46,799
michael s


973
0:47:46,799 --> 0:47:50,349
and you try to get customers to buy
these items


974
0:47:50,349 --> 0:47:52,799
people won't drive to you for lettuce


975
0:47:52,799 --> 0:47:55,97
but they might drive to you for peppers
and tomatoes


976
0:47:55,97 --> 0:48:1,859
and when they get their bill by lettuce
cucumbers and radishes for their salads


977
0:48:1,859 --> 0:48:5,96
because it's more economical to buy five
things in one stop


978
0:48:5,96 --> 0:48:8,749
and just peppers or tomatoes


979
0:48:8,749 --> 0:48:13,489
gasoline is expensive and we have to put
that into the equation


980
0:48:13,489 --> 0:48:17,799
i'd live eleven miles from a grocery
store and my neighbors and i have to


981
0:48:17,799 --> 0:48:21,139
spend four dollars to go there and back


982
0:48:21,139 --> 0:48:25,609
if they walk over and buy from me they
save four dollars


983
0:48:25,609 --> 0:48:30,869
they can spend that four dollars on
peppers tomatoes parsley so intro


984
0:48:30,869 --> 0:48:33,37
radishes let us and cucumbers


985
0:48:33,37 --> 0:48:35,449
and if they have silver coins


986
0:48:35,449 --> 0:48:37,909
i'll make them a special deal like


987
0:48:37,909 --> 0:48:40,13
three pounds of tomatoes for one


988
0:48:40,13 --> 0:48:44,739
pre-nineteen sixty five ninety percent
silver dyin


989
0:48:44,739 --> 0:48:49,429
it's attractive because you can
advertise three pounds for ten sounds


990
0:48:49,429 --> 0:48:54,16
and that silver dyin can be replaced the
next time a neighbor is near the coin


991
0:48:54,16 --> 0:48:55,109
dealer


992
0:48:55,109 --> 0:48:58,44
in december squash and cucumbers on the
menu


993
0:48:58,44 --> 0:49:1,209
and they are welcome addition to


994
0:49:1,209 --> 0:49:4,239
look how many varieties of squash in
there


995
0:49:4,239 --> 0:49:7,39
here is a middle eastern squash


996
0:49:7,39 --> 0:49:8,939
here's more squash


997
0:49:8,939 --> 0:49:11,509
these are orange cucumbers


998
0:49:11,509 --> 0:49:13,439
have you ever had them


999
0:49:13,439 --> 0:49:16,239
mean either but i want to try all of
them


1000
0:49:16,239 --> 0:49:20,959
look at this list december's almost the
coldest month of the year in north


1001
0:49:20,959 --> 0:49:24,279
america and just look at this list


1002
0:49:24,279 --> 0:49:28,849
list of things i can grow in arizona's
greatest in the colder months


1003
0:49:28,849 --> 0:49:30,729
look at january


1004
0:49:30,729 --> 0:49:34,249
tomatoes join the list and cabbage is
gone


1005
0:49:34,249 --> 0:49:39,699
cauliflower is gone brussel sprouts and
broccoli are also gone


1006
0:49:39,699 --> 0:49:41,979
when these crops come off the list


1007
0:49:41,979 --> 0:49:44,959
what you have this all you're going to
get


1008
0:49:44,959 --> 0:49:48,689
if you don't sell them it's not the end
of the world you know


1009
0:49:48,689 --> 0:49:53,19
you can store these they're very
delicious later so if you don't break in


1010
0:49:53,19 --> 0:49:56,349
the silver you cook and freeze what's
left


1011
0:49:56,349 --> 0:50:1,19
you can smile for months after the
season is over on color flower brussel


1012
0:50:1,19 --> 0:50:3,209
sprouts broccoli


1013
0:50:3,209 --> 0:50:6,989
those are good for at least six months
in the freezer to grow as much as you


1014
0:50:6,989 --> 0:50:9,819
can and have some frozen for later


1015
0:50:9,819 --> 0:50:12,979
here is february and march april and may


1016
0:50:12,979 --> 0:50:17,219
you can see in the list shortly no as
the weather gets warmer


1017
0:50:17,219 --> 0:50:18,989
pairs june


1018
0:50:18,989 --> 0:50:23,59
look at the drop off of crops like
admiral arizona


1019
0:50:23,59 --> 0:50:26,589
plants don't like a hundred and twenty
degree summers


1020
0:50:26,589 --> 0:50:28,989
and neither do i_ especially


1021
0:50:28,989 --> 0:50:32,449
my jacuzzi gets so hot from just
sunlight


1022
0:50:32,449 --> 0:50:34,829
that i have to get out to cool off


1023
0:50:34,829 --> 0:50:38,229
and i never feel the slightest that call


1024
0:50:38,229 --> 0:50:39,91
now use only the sun


1025
0:50:39,91 --> 0:50:43,369
and a garden hose and heat to the water


1026
0:50:43,369 --> 0:50:47,79
it's over a hundred and ten degrees
every day for at least two months and


1027
0:50:47,79 --> 0:50:51,809
summer and water in the garden hose gets
to about a hundred and eighty degrees on


1028
0:50:51,809 --> 0:50:55,79
the ground so i circulate that heat into
the jacuzzi with a pump


1029
0:50:55,79 --> 0:51:0,709
the cost nothing to operate it because
it's a swamp cooler poem


1030
0:51:0,709 --> 0:51:5,839
as i recall the water in the middle of
summer it was ninety five degrees and


1031
0:51:5,839 --> 0:51:11,109
the air was a hundred and six degrees
one-day than it was definitely too hot


1032
0:51:11,109 --> 0:51:13,259
to stay in the jacuzzi


1033
0:51:13,259 --> 0:51:18,639
on the coldest winter day can be twenty
degrees overnight and by four p m


1034
0:51:18,639 --> 0:51:20,879
it seventy five degrees


1035
0:51:20,879 --> 0:51:26,899
that's the climate here between two
someone in phoenix i'm in zone nine any


1036
0:51:26,899 --> 0:51:29,799
do you know about the hardiness zones


1037
0:51:29,799 --> 0:51:34,92
i'll give you a link at the and and you
can download the map and plan your crops


1038
0:51:34,92 --> 0:51:40,519
first locate your city on this map and
select all the crops you'd like to grow


1039
0:51:40,519 --> 0:51:47,59
bananas don't grow where they're slow so
that's a no go joel ho ho ho


1040
0:51:47,59 --> 0:51:52,119
use como images search engine and find
fruits and vegetables


1041
0:51:52,119 --> 0:51:53,9
make a list of what you like


1042
0:51:53,9 --> 0:51:57,64
doing research to find out when it's
planted where you live


1043
0:51:57,64 --> 0:52:1,9
be sure to consult the wife so you don't
have any more bulletholes try to make it


1044
0:52:1,9 --> 0:52:5,18
sound like it was all her idea to do the
planting


1045
0:52:5,18 --> 0:52:6,779
that keeps women happy


1046
0:52:6,779 --> 0:52:8,4
if you can work a spreadsheet


1047
0:52:8,4 --> 0:52:10,469
put them in columns by month


1048
0:52:10,469 --> 0:52:15,839
lookup each crop and read about when it
is planted in your hardiness zone


1049
0:52:15,839 --> 0:52:18,65
i put my fruits and vegetables in order


1050
0:52:18,65 --> 0:52:20,95
according to help valuable they are


1051
0:52:20,95 --> 0:52:23,299
because i want to swap my time


1052
0:52:23,299 --> 0:52:28,839
for the most valuable crops and then
they can get the most silver


1053
0:52:28,839 --> 0:52:33,189
because the farmer down the road who's
been growing asparagus for ten years


1054
0:52:33,189 --> 0:52:37,259
i'll gladly give him a dollar's worth of
let us which matures in just twenty


1055
0:52:37,259 --> 0:52:38,42
eight days


1056
0:52:38,42 --> 0:52:42,76
in exchange for a dollar's worth of
asparagus which takes two years to get


1057
0:52:42,76 --> 0:52:44,309
the first crop


1058
0:52:44,309 --> 0:52:48,819
platter fruit review could wait three
years for your first fruit


1059
0:52:48,819 --> 0:52:54,399
i planted three fir trees and all legal
lemon tree is bearing fruit at this time


1060
0:52:54,399 --> 0:52:59,329
and they're not yellow yet they've been
green foreign at least six months


1061
0:52:59,329 --> 0:53:3,59
both the neck during and the mandarin
orange flowered


1062
0:53:3,59 --> 0:53:4,47
started about


1063
0:53:4,47 --> 0:53:8,49
we lost that for some reason maybe it's
afraid of the dark


1064
0:53:8,49 --> 0:53:11,7
gets very dark in the desert i will go
out there


1065
0:53:11,7 --> 0:53:14,409
i'm afraid a bunny rabbit levy


1066
0:53:14,409 --> 0:53:17,169
well if it isn't that sheepskin


1067
0:53:17,169 --> 0:53:22,19
how have you know that i just got back
from the store buddy


1068
0:53:22,19 --> 0:53:24,209
and what did you get from a friend


1069
0:53:24,209 --> 0:53:26,28
don't give me any of your bunny rabbit


1070
0:53:26,28 --> 0:53:27,529
buttering up


1071
0:53:27,529 --> 0:53:32,589
i bought a couple of bunches of bananas
and one bunch is already yellow


1072
0:53:32,589 --> 0:53:33,569
yellow


1073
0:53:33,569 --> 0:53:35,579
what a lovely color


1074
0:53:35,579 --> 0:53:38,19
your eyes are yellow empty


1075
0:53:38,19 --> 0:53:39,289
know their blue


1076
0:53:39,289 --> 0:53:41,739
what do you take me for a reptile


1077
0:53:41,739 --> 0:53:46,979
on don't say that word a friend of mine
was eaten by a snake it was dreadful


1078
0:53:46,979 --> 0:53:50,539
well i'm sorry to hear about your friend
and paying the bills you know


1079
0:53:50,539 --> 0:53:51,5
what are you doing


1080
0:53:51,5 --> 0:53:53,559
human bananas


1081
0:53:53,559 --> 0:53:56,629
right now i'm doing a video for you to


1082
0:53:56,629 --> 0:53:59,739
what's new to i'd never heard of that
before


1083
0:53:59,739 --> 0:54:1,27
and we talked later


1084
0:54:1,27 --> 0:54:6,809
i'll tell you about your two then


1085
0:54:6,809 --> 0:54:11,909
he's friendlier than a con man when he
knows i've got a minimums


1086
0:54:11,909 --> 0:54:12,839
conduits


1087
0:54:12,839 --> 0:54:13,63
knows i've got


1088
0:54:13,63 --> 0:54:15,809
cannons


1089
0:54:15,809 --> 0:54:17,979
feeling a bit


1090
0:54:17,979 --> 0:54:20,879
we'll talk later i'm busy now


1091
0:54:20,879 --> 0:54:23,539
a friend in need is a friend indeed


1092
0:54:23,539 --> 0:54:26,92
he's probably telling on his friends
that i'm hoarding the bananas


1093
0:54:26,92 --> 0:54:30,6
watch at five tomorrow morning there
will be nine bunny rabbits lurking in


1094
0:54:30,6 --> 0:54:31,579
the dark


1095
0:54:31,579 --> 0:54:35,709
waiting for me to come out with rabbit
pellets bananas and oatmeal


1096
0:54:35,709 --> 0:54:40,369
each month i take out my spreadsheet and
look at what i can plant this month


1097
0:54:40,369 --> 0:54:43,42
i don't like looking six months in
advance because


1098
0:54:43,42 --> 0:54:45,329
those amounts are not here yet


1099
0:54:45,329 --> 0:54:49,399
i like looking at this month to know
what i can plant now and next month so i


1100
0:54:49,399 --> 0:54:51,16
can get my scenes together


1101
0:54:51,16 --> 0:54:52,869
and think about planting


1102
0:54:52,869 --> 0:54:57,169
if you order seats they come in just a
few days from the japanese selected


1103
0:54:57,169 --> 0:54:58,499
seeds


1104
0:54:58,499 --> 0:55:1,959
if you're going to become the slight
mind you need to know how cold it gets


1105
0:55:1,959 --> 0:55:3,589
where you live


1106
0:55:3,589 --> 0:55:7,349
you people in the cold war regions of
the country think that you can't plant


1107
0:55:7,349 --> 0:55:9,919
all year and this is not true


1108
0:55:9,919 --> 0:55:12,449
plants can germinate indoors


1109
0:55:12,449 --> 0:55:16,569
being the only two things one easter and
heat that's all


1110
0:55:16,569 --> 0:55:19,699
you keep your house at least fifty
degrees


1111
0:55:19,699 --> 0:55:23,329
you can have tomato plants that are four
inches high and ready for transplant


1112
0:55:23,329 --> 0:55:26,369
when other people are putting the for
seeds down


1113
0:55:26,369 --> 0:55:29,83
so don't let three months of snowy
winter stop you from having a


1114
0:55:29,83 --> 0:55:32,129
twelve-month growing season


1115
0:55:32,129 --> 0:55:36,929
rely on the hardiness zone to determine
which will be successful crops


1116
0:55:36,929 --> 0:55:41,189
and don't attempt anything that's likely
to fail unless she started indoors and


1117
0:55:41,189 --> 0:55:43,889
give it a good chance for survival


1118
0:55:43,889 --> 0:55:48,439
many people are writing about this stuff
online you can find thousands of


1119
0:55:48,439 --> 0:55:50,729
interesting articles every month


1120
0:55:50,729 --> 0:55:53,939
if you know how to use a search engine


1121
0:55:53,939 --> 0:55:57,539
call this one consideration in many
areas but in the desert we have another


1122
0:55:57,539 --> 0:55:59,859
factor dryness


1123
0:55:59,859 --> 0:56:4,319
it's so dry here that you could do a
drum roll in tories face when she comes


1124
0:56:4,319 --> 0:56:5,359
here


1125
0:56:5,359 --> 0:56:10,529
so the amount of rainfall you get is
directly related to how many things grow


1126
0:56:10,529 --> 0:56:14,589
if a lot of things grow where you live
then a lot of things die and when they


1127
0:56:14,589 --> 0:56:20,66
die they contribute organic material to
make topsoil organic material just means


1128
0:56:20,66 --> 0:56:22,78
the minerals unique birth


1129
0:56:22,78 --> 0:56:27,45
combined with water and sunshine and
carbon dioxide from the air that's


1130
0:56:27,45 --> 0:56:29,669
carbon dioxide


1131
0:56:29,669 --> 0:56:30,599
carbon


1132
0:56:30,599 --> 0:56:31,799
dioxide


1133
0:56:31,799 --> 0:56:36,559
that carbon makes organic materials so
that plants


1134
0:56:36,559 --> 0:56:38,629
take the minerals from the soil


1135
0:56:38,629 --> 0:56:40,929
and sunshine for energy


1136
0:56:40,929 --> 0:56:47,579
they convert that into food or sugars by
using carbon dioxide from the air


1137
0:56:47,579 --> 0:56:51,359
carbon dioxide is a nutrient for plants


1138
0:56:51,359 --> 0:56:54,19
it's not poison it shouldn't be taxed


1139
0:56:54,19 --> 0:56:55,65
in order to reduce it


1140
0:56:55,65 --> 0:56:57,21
it should be respected


1141
0:56:57,21 --> 0:57:2,409
as a plant nutrient so don't take al
gore's word for anything


1142
0:57:2,409 --> 0:57:7,79
now we have two presidential candidates
who both won a charges attacks for the


1143
0:57:7,79 --> 0:57:9,489
carbon dioxide in the air


1144
0:57:9,489 --> 0:57:13,929
that's going to drive up the prices of
everything across the board and who gets


1145
0:57:13,929 --> 0:57:15,869
the smiley this tax


1146
0:57:15,869 --> 0:57:17,1
the alone without e


1147
0:57:17,1 --> 0:57:20,96
we should all be opposed to it and you
should all be making videos to express


1148
0:57:20,96 --> 0:57:22,999
your opposition


1149
0:57:22,999 --> 0:57:23,789
anyway


1150
0:57:23,789 --> 0:57:27,379
the organic material makes topsoil


1151
0:57:27,379 --> 0:57:32,449
and you might have ten million years of
topsoil are you love


1152
0:57:32,449 --> 0:57:36,219
you might want to use it to your
advantage to make some extra money from


1153
0:57:36,219 --> 0:57:40,149
a small amount of water and free
sunshine


1154
0:57:40,149 --> 0:57:43,309
this will help them to meet for no and
later


1155
0:57:43,309 --> 0:57:46,64
you'll have food when other people have
only guns


1156
0:57:46,64 --> 0:57:50,69
if you have food and they have guns
who's going to win


1157
0:57:50,69 --> 0:57:52,579
they are


1158
0:57:52,579 --> 0:57:55,749
because guns trumbull food


1159
0:57:55,749 --> 0:57:58,349
but if they don't know you have fluid


1160
0:57:58,349 --> 0:58:0,909
then you'll be able to eat


1161
0:58:0,909 --> 0:58:5,179
and when they see off that you are the
old shoot u_n_ eat you


1162
0:58:5,179 --> 0:58:8,52
so anyway the guy with the gun lines up
with all the food in the end


1163
0:58:8,52 --> 0:58:10,919
that's why people are buying guns


1164
0:58:10,919 --> 0:58:15,549
government is not going to protect you
from people who have guns


1165
0:58:15,549 --> 0:58:18,79
there are going to be a food riots


1166
0:58:18,79 --> 0:58:22,109
government's not going to protect you
the government poisons your water with


1167
0:58:22,109 --> 0:58:23,9
fluorine


1168
0:58:23,9 --> 0:58:27,2
new year's your tax dollars to build
fema camps for you'll an underground


1169
0:58:27,2 --> 0:58:29,49
cities for them


1170
0:58:29,49 --> 0:58:31,479
so what's your take on government


1171
0:58:31,479 --> 0:58:33,959
paid off the rose colored glasses


1172
0:58:33,959 --> 0:58:37,349
and see the nazis at work for a change


1173
0:58:37,349 --> 0:58:41,479
i wouldn't mind seeing all the nazis
turned into topsoil and the sooner the


1174
0:58:41,479 --> 0:58:42,859
better


1175
0:58:42,859 --> 0:58:45,939
in arizona we don't have topsoil


1176
0:58:45,939 --> 0:58:47,739
we never heard of it


1177
0:58:47,739 --> 0:58:51,569
we live on top of the dried out all
shouldn't bottom


1178
0:58:51,569 --> 0:58:53,289
and it's salty


1179
0:58:53,289 --> 0:58:55,99
because all the rain that falls
evaporates


1180
0:58:55,99 --> 0:59:0,64
and only the salts that were in the
water are left behind the high altitudes


1181
0:59:0,64 --> 0:59:3,509
in new mexico get rain and snow


1182
0:59:3,509 --> 0:59:4,61
and arizona


1183
0:59:4,61 --> 0:59:7,609
gets the water as a result


1184
0:59:7,609 --> 0:59:9,17
most of that water


1185
0:59:9,17 --> 0:59:10,599
is used for farming


1186
0:59:10,599 --> 0:59:15,959
and evaporates leaving behind salts
which make it hard to grow things


1187
0:59:15,959 --> 0:59:19,65
the pure water that evaporates becomes
clouds


1188
0:59:19,65 --> 0:59:21,41
and they pass over your house


1189
0:59:21,41 --> 0:59:23,24
and since it's colder there


1190
0:59:23,24 --> 0:59:25,789
rainfalls and you get our water


1191
0:59:25,789 --> 0:59:28,319
this is why we hate you and what you dad


1192
0:59:28,319 --> 0:59:29,519
just joking


1193
0:59:29,519 --> 0:59:34,799
if you catch that rain it's pure water
in the nazis don't want you drinking


1194
0:59:34,799 --> 0:59:35,819
that water


1195
0:59:35,819 --> 0:59:40,449
because there's no lorena if you drink
it you'll be smart


1196
0:59:40,449 --> 0:59:44,499
you'll know what's really going on with
the p_s_a_ the n_s_a_ the c_i_a_ and all


1197
0:59:44,499 --> 0:59:49,849
the other is and government alphabet
gangs of organized criminals


1198
0:59:49,849 --> 0:59:54,1
you'll be out buying guns along with
record numbers of other americans


1199
0:59:54,1 --> 0:59:58,309
who have a clue and they're getting
ready to wipe out the nazis and bring


1200
0:59:58,309 --> 1:0:0,339
the constitution back


1201
1:0:0,339 --> 1:0:4,299
i don't like violence but if it's on tv
i might watch it because i'm used to


1202
1:0:4,299 --> 1:0:6,499
violence on t_v_


1203
1:0:6,499 --> 1:0:10,64
some people say that all bobble already
shredded the constitution and there's no


1204
1:0:10,64 --> 1:0:12,229
bring it back


1205
1:0:12,229 --> 1:0:14,91
i thought he was using it as a doormat


1206
1:0:14,91 --> 1:0:16,2
at the white house


1207
1:0:16,2 --> 1:0:19,819
and all we have to do is clean off the
mud but i could be wrong


1208
1:0:19,819 --> 1:0:25,259
he signed an executive order for every
power imaginable and he has effectively


1209
1:0:25,259 --> 1:0:29,869
made himself king or bomb a and i don't
like this one bit


1210
1:0:29,869 --> 1:0:34,819
if a lynch mob goes to washington to
string up that illegal alien that will


1211
1:0:34,819 --> 1:0:39,169
be sad but i'm not going to stop them
because they have guns and i could get


1212
1:0:39,169 --> 1:0:40,849
myself killed


1213
1:0:40,849 --> 1:0:45,609
storing the rainwater is now a crime but
killing americans who have been charged


1214
1:0:45,609 --> 1:0:48,119
with any crime isn't


1215
1:0:48,119 --> 1:0:50,109
that's the law


1216
1:0:50,109 --> 1:0:53,559
does that apply to the juror living in
the white house


1217
1:0:53,559 --> 1:0:57,369
iski fair game to buy this executive
order


1218
1:0:57,369 --> 1:1:0,25
well the king will have to protect
themselves because


1219
1:1:0,25 --> 1:1:3,639
are not interested in fighting on his
side


1220
1:1:3,639 --> 1:1:7,389
i think the average american should stay
out of this fight not the dictator


1221
1:1:7,389 --> 1:1:9,659
defenders on dictatorship


1222
1:1:9,659 --> 1:1:14,89
the people don't like dictators and if
anyone moves into the white house


1223
1:1:14,89 --> 1:1:18,499
using false documents and under
fraudulent circumstances he will have to


1224
1:1:18,499 --> 1:1:21,589
protect himself against rebellion


1225
1:1:21,589 --> 1:1:26,18
i'm personally offended by nine hundred
of the most recent


1226
1:1:26,18 --> 1:1:29,71
executive orders that king will buy
among has signed


1227
1:1:29,71 --> 1:1:34,339
anna fathers are aware and take offense
i'm not surprised


1228
1:1:34,339 --> 1:1:37,73
the people should see the corruption and
see the dictatorship


1229
1:1:37,73 --> 1:1:42,13
they conspiracies and the reason why
nazis must put fluoride and your


1230
1:1:42,13 --> 1:1:43,22
drinking water


1231
1:1:43,22 --> 1:1:46,839
if you want to opt out and drink
rainwater i don't blame you


1232
1:1:46,839 --> 1:1:50,569
if you drink rainwater you'll begin to
see clearly


1233
1:1:50,569 --> 1:1:52,769
and the nazis came out of that


1234
1:1:52,769 --> 1:1:56,839
bill arrested and charged with the crime
of drinking water that doesn't have


1235
1:1:56,839 --> 1:2:1,69
fluoride compounds and that that's rat
poison and they want you drinking that


1236
1:2:1,69 --> 1:2:3,34
so how do you get around it


1237
1:2:3,34 --> 1:2:7,77
there's a lot of moisture and watermelon
cantaloupe squash tomatoes cucumbers and


1238
1:2:7,77 --> 1:2:13,89
so on so you can sleep water through
these crops without going to jail


1239
1:2:13,89 --> 1:2:17,379
monsanto wants you to buy their seeds
and so they bought up all the seed


1240
1:2:17,379 --> 1:2:23,239
companies to make sure you don't need
unless they charge you monopoly prices


1241
1:2:23,239 --> 1:2:25,709
this is a form of slavery


1242
1:2:25,709 --> 1:2:30,39
but that's not all monsanto does to you
me and everyone else


1243
1:2:30,39 --> 1:2:32,839
they modified the seeds so they can have


1244
1:2:32,839 --> 1:2:37,9
full control over the nutrition and
other factors that are genetically


1245
1:2:37,9 --> 1:2:38,479
dependent


1246
1:2:38,479 --> 1:2:40,449
they're called g edible


1247
1:2:40,449 --> 1:2:43,739
genetically modified organisms


1248
1:2:43,739 --> 1:2:46,13
if you don't want g_m_ oilseeds


1249
1:2:46,13 --> 1:2:47,679
too bad


1250
1:2:47,679 --> 1:2:51,88
there is a conspiracy to diminish the
nutritional value of your


1251
1:2:51,88 --> 1:2:54,76
food so that you are malnourished


1252
1:2:54,76 --> 1:2:58,17
and if you look into codecs element
terry ellis


1253
1:2:58,17 --> 1:3:3,89
you'll be horrified by the crimes they
are committing against humanity and this


1254
1:3:3,89 --> 1:3:6,259
is what your government has on their
agenda


1255
1:3:6,259 --> 1:3:7,779
you need to know about it


1256
1:3:7,779 --> 1:3:11,459
and plant your garden so you can survive


1257
1:3:11,459 --> 1:3:12,999
i'm not joking


1258
1:3:12,999 --> 1:3:19,429
do your research and make videos tell
others about kodak's element arias


1259
1:3:19,429 --> 1:3:23,949
i'll give you an excellent link at the
end of this video you must watch this


1260
1:3:23,949 --> 1:3:28,129
lecture by doctor reema label


1261
1:3:28,129 --> 1:3:32,869
these nazis have full control of
congress and they passed legislation


1262
1:3:32,869 --> 1:3:35,549
that favors monsanto


1263
1:3:35,549 --> 1:3:40,59
this is one more reason for you need to
plant your own vegetables and fruits


1264
1:3:40,59 --> 1:3:42,309
using seats that on part


1265
1:3:42,309 --> 1:3:44,49
of the monsanto monopoly


1266
1:3:44,49 --> 1:3:49,5
this is one more reason where we need to
get rid of congress because they are not


1267
1:3:49,5 --> 1:3:51,719
your representatives


1268
1:3:51,719 --> 1:3:55,319
you pay them they're supposed to vote
according to your wishes


1269
1:3:55,319 --> 1:3:56,779
but they don't


1270
1:3:56,779 --> 1:3:58,319
they're corrupt


1271
1:3:58,319 --> 1:4:0,459
and we need to get rid of them


1272
1:4:0,459 --> 1:4:4,299
we no longer needed representatives in
this country


1273
1:4:4,299 --> 1:4:7,419
they will flee sue for all you have


1274
1:4:7,419 --> 1:4:11,699
they will keep you poor as a control
mechanism


1275
1:4:11,699 --> 1:4:15,19
and i'm advocating that each state
secede


1276
1:4:15,19 --> 1:4:17,839
from the federal nazi urine


1277
1:4:17,839 --> 1:4:23,89
and you drop out of their fiat currency
system as much as you can


1278
1:4:23,89 --> 1:4:28,909
cell tomatoes at a much lower price just
to get the ninety percent silver coins


1279
1:4:28,909 --> 1:4:33,969
the nazis don't counts over as a
currency so you don't have to either


1280
1:4:33,969 --> 1:4:37,89
they have made silver in non currency


1281
1:4:37,89 --> 1:4:40,39
so when you receive it it's not income


1282
1:4:40,39 --> 1:4:42,629
disrupt your tomatoes for the silver


1283
1:4:42,629 --> 1:4:47,799
do you know any laws on the books that
requires you to file a tax return


1284
1:4:47,799 --> 1:4:51,129
many people have tried to find it and
they can't


1285
1:4:51,129 --> 1:4:54,259
lawyers have tried to find it and they
can't


1286
1:4:54,259 --> 1:4:56,959
but nobody wants to talk about this


1287
1:4:56,959 --> 1:5:0,889
because they're afraid of retaliation by
the nazis


1288
1:5:0,889 --> 1:5:5,45
who have the average american convinced
that they have to file a tax return


1289
1:5:5,45 --> 1:5:9,219
this is by all definitions a mafia


1290
1:5:9,219 --> 1:5:10,44
it's a racket


1291
1:5:10,44 --> 1:5:13,609
and nobody is opposing this mob


1292
1:5:13,609 --> 1:5:16,299
so you have a duty to spread the truth


1293
1:5:16,299 --> 1:5:20,689
eric holder is not going to prosecute
the i_r_s_


1294
1:5:20,689 --> 1:5:25,489
he's going to run guns to mexico make a
little side money


1295
1:5:25,489 --> 1:5:28,429
the whole god damn system is corrupt


1296
1:5:28,429 --> 1:5:31,619
thoroughly corrupt through and through


1297
1:5:31,619 --> 1:5:34,669
the mafia is in control


1298
1:5:34,669 --> 1:5:38,509
they have rackets just like any other
mob


1299
1:5:38,509 --> 1:5:43,489
and if you make videos all you have to
do is ask the question where is the law


1300
1:5:43,489 --> 1:5:49,949
which states that americans working in
america have to file a tax return


1301
1:5:49,949 --> 1:5:54,749
why is money automatically taken of
americans' paychecks


1302
1:5:54,749 --> 1:5:56,109
why


1303
1:5:56,109 --> 1:6:1,209
all the judges or corrupt because they
they rule in favor of the i_r_s_


1304
1:6:1,209 --> 1:6:4,399
there are many videos about this on you
too


1305
1:6:4,399 --> 1:6:6,439
and if you have not watch them


1306
1:6:6,439 --> 1:6:10,219
what are you waiting for an invitation


1307
1:6:10,219 --> 1:6:15,289
i cordially invite you to watch it to a
videos on the ira s and the laws


1308
1:6:15,289 --> 1:6:18,539
regarding filing a tax return


1309
1:6:18,539 --> 1:6:22,669
when you get through in your learn the
truth your going to be very very angry


1310
1:6:22,669 --> 1:6:25,53
because you paid money that you might
feel


1311
1:6:25,53 --> 1:6:28,799
was not justified by anymore on the
books


1312
1:6:28,799 --> 1:6:31,199
congress' cowardly


1313
1:6:31,199 --> 1:6:34,719
they know about this and they have done
nothing about it


1314
1:6:34,719 --> 1:6:37,76
deter busy lining their pockets with
cash


1315
1:6:37,76 --> 1:6:39,459
from deals


1316
1:6:39,459 --> 1:6:44,339
they use their political influence to
make deals for their own behalf


1317
1:6:44,339 --> 1:6:49,449
they were staying power so they can
continue to rape the country


1318
1:6:49,449 --> 1:6:52,279
that's why i think we don't need these
bastards


1319
1:6:52,279 --> 1:6:57,99
and we need to get rid of the entire
washington band of conspiratorial spin


1320
1:6:57,99 --> 1:7:0,759
if he'd stayed so scenes it's done


1321
1:7:0,759 --> 1:7:3,46
the federal government is effectively
fired


1322
1:7:3,46 --> 1:7:8,809
and all the laws they pass to control
uart instantly revoked


1323
1:7:8,809 --> 1:7:12,769
if you believe unless tell others with
the youtube video


1324
1:7:12,769 --> 1:7:20,3
learn how to push record on d audacity
free software from snap files dot com


1325
1:7:20,3 --> 1:7:23,47
trade tomatoes for silver and get some
real money


1326
1:7:23,47 --> 1:7:26,9
instead of the studio currency


1327
1:7:26,9 --> 1:7:30,66
you're sayin' might say tomatoes ten
cents a pound if you use ninety percent


1328
1:7:30,66 --> 1:7:35,339
silver coins dollar upon if you use the
fiat currency


1329
1:7:35,339 --> 1:7:39,419
if according to its minted before in
nineteen sixty five


1330
1:7:39,419 --> 1:7:42,63
it's ninety percent silver the supplies
to


1331
1:7:42,63 --> 1:7:43,55
dimes


1332
1:7:43,55 --> 1:7:44,57
quarters


1333
1:7:44,57 --> 1:7:47,39
and half dollars only


1334
1:7:47,39 --> 1:7:51,899
loops i just looked it up so restraining
today at thirty two dollars and eleven


1335
1:7:51,899 --> 1:7:53,74
cents per troy balance


1336
1:7:53,74 --> 1:7:57,449
which means that those ninety percent
dimes


1337
1:7:57,449 --> 1:8:0,569
are valued at two dollars and thirty
seven speech


1338
1:8:0,569 --> 1:8:3,9
as of october twenty first two thousand
twelve


1339
1:8:3,9 --> 1:8:9,23
and so it would not be wise to charge
that much for tornadoes or peppers


1340
1:8:9,23 --> 1:8:11,289
because you won't get any silver


1341
1:8:11,289 --> 1:8:13,2
and that's the objective here


1342
1:8:13,2 --> 1:8:17,169
lower the price of tomatoes so thats
overflows to you


1343
1:8:17,169 --> 1:8:20,579
if you give customers three pounds of
tomatoes


1344
1:8:20,579 --> 1:8:22,659
for a dime silver done at that


1345
1:8:22,659 --> 1:8:25,329
fiat craft when it comes out to almost


1346
1:8:25,329 --> 1:8:27,83
seventy seven cents per pound


1347
1:8:27,83 --> 1:8:32,53
and this is enough incentive to make
people stop off at the silver dealer and


1348
1:8:32,53 --> 1:8:35,23
bison chunks over diamonds


1349
1:8:35,23 --> 1:8:38,579
if a thousand people buy one bag each


1350
1:8:38,579 --> 1:8:41,35
the nazis won't bother tracking them


1351
1:8:41,35 --> 1:8:45,96
but if you go to the silver dealer and
buy a thousand bags of junk silver


1352
1:8:45,96 --> 1:8:49,829
announces will be on you like a fly on
watermelon


1353
1:8:49,829 --> 1:8:53,279
they'll come to your house and take it
at gunpoint


1354
1:8:53,279 --> 1:8:57,23
the nazis are already doing this to
people on the highways have you heard


1355
1:8:57,23 --> 1:9:1,469
somebody sent me a link for you tube
clip of the news


1356
1:9:1,469 --> 1:9:4,91
there was a man in tennessee driving a
semi trailer truck


1357
1:9:4,91 --> 1:9:8,51
and he had two hundred thousand dollars
in cash on the truck and they took it


1358
1:9:8,51 --> 1:9:13,1
from him they didn't charge him with any
crime he wasn't committing any crime


1359
1:9:13,1 --> 1:9:17,56
they just took his two hundred thousand
cash from memphis is private property


1360
1:9:17,56 --> 1:9:21,64
it's an illegal search-and-seizure it's
unconstitutional they took


1361
1:9:21,64 --> 1:9:24,7
two hundred thousand dollars from this
man


1362
1:9:24,7 --> 1:9:26,739
and i ask you what's next


1363
1:9:26,739 --> 1:9:29,409
they're going to come to your house and
take your silver


1364
1:9:29,409 --> 1:9:33,0
we're going to take your gold they're
going to rape your daughters


1365
1:9:33,0 --> 1:9:37,67
because we are moving into an area of
total lawlessness


1366
1:9:37,67 --> 1:9:38,819
the mafia


1367
1:9:38,819 --> 1:9:40,939
runs the country


1368
1:9:40,939 --> 1:9:45,849
pulling people all over in doing illegal
and unconstitutional searches


1369
1:9:45,849 --> 1:9:48,759
finding one e and keeping it


1370
1:9:48,759 --> 1:9:53,779
why would they do this when the c_i_a_
is the mafia that's dealing in drugs in


1371
1:9:53,779 --> 1:9:55,489
the first place


1372
1:9:55,489 --> 1:10:0,0
folks we have to do something because
this can only get worse


1373
1:10:0,0 --> 1:10:3,84
record your opinion and make videos for
you to


1374
1:10:3,84 --> 1:10:8,149
we need to spread the truth about what
they are doing to us


1375
1:10:8,149 --> 1:10:10,77
robbing the people blind


1376
1:10:10,77 --> 1:10:15,5
printing money and driving up the costs
of everything through inflation as a


1377
1:10:15,5 --> 1:10:18,42
result of printing the money


1378
1:10:18,42 --> 1:10:21,48
old people on fixed incomes can't make
it


1379
1:10:21,48 --> 1:10:26,96
and that's intentional that is not a
accent they want to kill older people


1380
1:10:26,96 --> 1:10:30,41
they put a pig virus in the vaccines
that


1381
1:10:30,41 --> 1:10:34,68
are given to children old people and
uh... diseases that are developed are


1382
1:10:34,68 --> 1:10:36,27
wasting away


1383
1:10:36,27 --> 1:10:39,4
i did a video about this and if you
haven't seen it


1384
1:10:39,4 --> 1:10:43,43
uh... put the link at the end of this
video so you can watch that video your


1385
1:10:43,43 --> 1:10:48,909
government cannot be trusted for
anything especially vaccines


1386
1:10:48,909 --> 1:10:52,619
now in order to help these old people
who are starving to death you can give


1387
1:10:52,619 --> 1:10:54,219
them my head of lettuce


1388
1:10:54,219 --> 1:10:57,469
a dollar head of lettuce that only cost
you a penny


1389
1:10:57,469 --> 1:10:59,3
for the seed


1390
1:10:59,3 --> 1:11:2,12
and you've gotten a lot of bang for your
block


1391
1:11:2,12 --> 1:11:5,84
you probably can't sell everything you
grow


1392
1:11:5,84 --> 1:11:8,73
but first of all grow enough to feed
your own family


1393
1:11:8,73 --> 1:11:11,55
and then if you have anything left over
extra


1394
1:11:11,55 --> 1:11:12,579
you can swap it


1395
1:11:12,579 --> 1:11:16,84
for silver dimes and before you little
pet of let us go bad


1396
1:11:16,84 --> 1:11:21,419
walk it down to a neighbor that lives of
block or two away


1397
1:11:21,419 --> 1:11:23,149
and give it to them


1398
1:11:23,149 --> 1:11:25,58
it's better than throwing it away


1399
1:11:25,58 --> 1:11:30,179
want to tell you about a pick your own
fruits and vegetables farm near me


1400
1:11:30,179 --> 1:11:32,26
it's in queen creek


1401
1:11:32,26 --> 1:11:33,789
this cold snap


1402
1:11:33,789 --> 1:11:35,1
farms


1403
1:11:35,1 --> 1:11:39,27
they've been in business since nineteen
fourteen


1404
1:11:39,27 --> 1:11:42,289
let's see what war worry them down


1405
1:11:42,289 --> 1:11:47,26
world war one my grandfather was
poisoned with mustard gas


1406
1:11:47,26 --> 1:11:50,73
they've been in business almost a
hundred years


1407
1:11:50,73 --> 1:11:54,89
they let you pick your own they charge
you a dollar fifty apollo and


1408
1:11:54,89 --> 1:11:57,26
remembered the swiss chard


1409
1:11:57,26 --> 1:11:59,429
at eight dollars a pound


1410
1:11:59,429 --> 1:12:2,8
well how does a dollar fifty opponents
alone


1411
1:12:2,8 --> 1:12:7,729
let's see what they have available in
october they have swiss sharan


1412
1:12:7,729 --> 1:12:8,48
ko


1413
1:12:8,48 --> 1:12:13,64
red potatoes white potato sweet against
yellow squash and zucchini as nationals


1414
1:12:13,64 --> 1:12:15,869
and they have some apples


1415
1:12:15,869 --> 1:12:20,639
well i can beat all of these prices at
walmart i don't pay a dollar fifty for a


1416
1:12:20,639 --> 1:12:26,849
pound of potatoes onions or zucchini i
can do better on all three i'd just paid


1417
1:12:26,849 --> 1:12:30,99
twenty cents a pound it's safe for you
remember


1418
1:12:30,99 --> 1:12:34,269
normally i'd buy potatoes for about
thirty five cents a pound nala dollar


1419
1:12:34,269 --> 1:12:36,5
fifty a problem


1420
1:12:36,5 --> 1:12:40,53
i guess people like pick your own so
much that they'll pay through the nose


1421
1:12:40,53 --> 1:12:44,76
remember that when you pledge your crops
and try to get silver


1422
1:12:44,76 --> 1:12:47,469
fruits and vegetables are currency
system


1423
1:12:47,469 --> 1:12:49,26
and you need to get on board


1424
1:12:49,26 --> 1:12:53,21
so offer your customers away to get your
products cheaper


1425
1:12:53,21 --> 1:12:58,469
by buying up the junk silver as it's
called in the numismatic field and allow


1426
1:12:58,469 --> 1:13:1,289
your customers to come in to your place
of business


1427
1:13:1,289 --> 1:13:6,889
this walks over for salon troll or let
us or melons or eggplant


1428
1:13:6,889 --> 1:13:9,59
instead of putting your junk silver in
the bank


1429
1:13:9,59 --> 1:13:11,18
where anybody can seize it


1430
1:13:11,18 --> 1:13:12,699
put it under a pallet


1431
1:13:12,699 --> 1:13:13,869
and leave it there


1432
1:13:13,869 --> 1:13:18,6
until that's the only accepted currency
that anyone who will take


1433
1:13:18,6 --> 1:13:20,96
because the day is coming sooner or
later


1434
1:13:20,96 --> 1:13:25,44
when people will not accept u_s_
currency any longer


1435
1:13:25,44 --> 1:13:29,11
and all that currency will become
worthless overnight


1436
1:13:29,11 --> 1:13:32,989
those people who have billions and
billions of dollars in u_s_ currency


1437
1:13:32,989 --> 1:13:34,34
will lose it


1438
1:13:34,34 --> 1:13:37,899
everyone's expecting the u_s_ currency
to collapse


1439
1:13:37,899 --> 1:13:40,66
so i spent fifty one dollars on cns


1440
1:13:40,66 --> 1:13:44,199
and i think that fifty one dollars will
grow


1441
1:13:44,199 --> 1:13:49,36
i received ninety four thousand five
hundred seeds and i want to show you


1442
1:13:49,36 --> 1:13:50,59
that list now


1443
1:13:50,59 --> 1:13:55,28
and i want to tell you where to go to do
likewise if you care to


1444
1:13:55,28 --> 1:13:58,36
my order with johnny's seeds


1445
1:13:58,36 --> 1:14:0,8
remember the swiss chard


1446
1:14:0,8 --> 1:14:4,969
for me in the short season begins in
september and i can grow


1447
1:14:4,969 --> 1:14:9,139
shar in october november december
january february


1448
1:14:9,139 --> 1:14:11,309
and it ends in march


1449
1:14:11,309 --> 1:14:13,249
september to march


1450
1:14:13,249 --> 1:14:15,739
but six months is good enough for me


1451
1:14:15,739 --> 1:14:17,619
i bought a thousand cv's


1452
1:14:17,619 --> 1:14:20,1
for four dollars and thirty cents


1453
1:14:20,1 --> 1:14:23,929
so a hundred seats cost me just forty
three cents


1454
1:14:23,929 --> 1:14:26,449
will have recovered the six pounds


1455
1:14:26,449 --> 1:14:28,659
about four plants and i'm good


1456
1:14:28,659 --> 1:14:31,7
and i have a thousand chance is right


1457
1:14:31,7 --> 1:14:33,78
the bunny as well in a lot of that
idon't mind


1458
1:14:33,78 --> 1:14:37,51
vine is really really four plants so i
can break even


1459
1:14:37,51 --> 1:14:42,73
i'll buy them off with bananas and i'll
get the spotted ones at deep discount


1460
1:14:42,73 --> 1:14:46,519
the bunnies will never know cuz i'll
kill them before they see them


1461
1:14:46,519 --> 1:14:51,579
if they fill up on bananas delete my
swiss chard alone


1462
1:14:51,579 --> 1:14:54,939
it takes fifty five days to mature


1463
1:14:54,939 --> 1:14:59,169
but you can sneak baby sharin if you
just can't wait


1464
1:14:59,169 --> 1:15:1,639
in just twenty eight days


1465
1:15:1,639 --> 1:15:6,19
i never grew swiss chard benefits like
lettuce a grows back a few times before


1466
1:15:6,19 --> 1:15:8,199
going to see


1467
1:15:8,199 --> 1:15:12,11
catch the scenes and you can plant them
or sell them to recover your four


1468
1:15:12,11 --> 1:15:16,639
dollars and thirty cents for all you
chip skates who can't stand spending


1469
1:15:16,639 --> 1:15:18,28
money


1470
1:15:18,28 --> 1:15:23,25
billions in the bank let somebody else
who for thirty cents you cry like a baby


1471
1:15:23,25 --> 1:15:25,39
alright she wrote


1472
1:15:25,39 --> 1:15:27,949
you can get all your money back concedes


1473
1:15:27,949 --> 1:15:32,649
just get your neighbors interested and
sell them seats for ten cents each


1474
1:15:32,649 --> 1:15:36,61
if they buy a hundred sees dropped the
price to a nickel each


1475
1:15:36,61 --> 1:15:39,6
you'll be driving a jaguar in no time


1476
1:15:39,6 --> 1:15:42,5
and if you brush your teeth may be a
girl were ride with you


1477
1:15:42,5 --> 1:15:44,8
i bought calypso salon tro


1478
1:15:44,8 --> 1:15:48,649
for four dollars and fifty five cents


1479
1:15:48,649 --> 1:15:51,0
thirty five hundred seeds


1480
1:15:51,0 --> 1:15:54,329
i love so much oil and i want that stuff
around me


1481
1:15:54,329 --> 1:15:56,79
all the time


1482
1:15:56,79 --> 1:16:0,55
i can grow this urban arizona from
september to april


1483
1:16:0,55 --> 1:16:5,769
so i have eight months salon trolex
sunny cold weather like lettuce


1484
1:16:5,769 --> 1:16:9,3
but does not like soaking wet soil


1485
1:16:9,3 --> 1:16:13,169
can you imagine city cherry or salsa
without salon tro


1486
1:16:13,169 --> 1:16:15,6
go to jail if you try


1487
1:16:15,6 --> 1:16:19,85
and sleeps my god soups without so i'm
sure you should be shot


1488
1:16:19,85 --> 1:16:23,78
cilantro ads such a nice flavor to soups


1489
1:16:23,78 --> 1:16:24,99
if you haven't tried it


1490
1:16:24,99 --> 1:16:28,229
try it and stop being a stick in the mud


1491
1:16:28,229 --> 1:16:33,889
a hundred plans for thirteen cents
material germany enrichment purity


1492
1:16:33,889 --> 1:16:38,719
the charging me about fifty cents for a
bunch of solo intro in the store


1493
1:16:38,719 --> 1:16:40,31
and so the potential


1494
1:16:40,31 --> 1:16:42,349
is fifty dollars back


1495
1:16:42,349 --> 1:16:45,27
for each thirteen sounds invested


1496
1:16:45,27 --> 1:16:46,38
and immature


1497
1:16:46,38 --> 1:16:48,419
in fifty five days


1498
1:16:48,419 --> 1:16:52,94
leave it alone and it will go to see it
at one hundred twenty days


1499
1:16:52,94 --> 1:16:56,689
then you have thousands of new seats for
the next season


1500
1:16:56,689 --> 1:17:0,53
you don't have to buying a new seats you
couldn't even sell them to recover your


1501
1:17:0,53 --> 1:17:2,3
five dollars


1502
1:17:2,3 --> 1:17:7,32
i bought five thousand cucumber seeds
for ten dollars and seventy cents


1503
1:17:7,32 --> 1:17:10,31
each plant will give you a few cucumbers


1504
1:17:10,31 --> 1:17:13,239
so maybe you get ten thousand cucumbers


1505
1:17:13,239 --> 1:17:15,83
at a value of fifty cents each


1506
1:17:15,83 --> 1:17:17,559
how much is that word


1507
1:17:17,559 --> 1:17:19,5
five thousand dollars back


1508
1:17:19,5 --> 1:17:21,98
from five thousand sees


1509
1:17:21,98 --> 1:17:25,4
that's like getting a dollar for each
seed


1510
1:17:25,4 --> 1:17:30,0
how many seats do you have to have
germinate and produce cucumbers in order


1511
1:17:30,0 --> 1:17:34,409
to get back you were original cost


1512
1:17:34,409 --> 1:17:37,929
have five thousand seats twenty is easy


1513
1:17:37,929 --> 1:17:40,9
so make the investment


1514
1:17:40,9 --> 1:17:42,639
if you leave eleven dollars in the bank


1515
1:17:42,639 --> 1:17:46,849
what with the bank give u five thousand
dollars i doubt it


1516
1:17:46,849 --> 1:17:51,159
put your money where it will grow and
get out of that fiat currency


1517
1:17:51,159 --> 1:17:55,57
the fiat currency is a trial don't fall
into the abyss


1518
1:17:55,57 --> 1:17:58,309
he's mature in fifty eight days


1519
1:17:58,309 --> 1:17:59,28
i can plant


1520
1:17:59,28 --> 1:18:3,3
cucumbers in december january february
and march


1521
1:18:3,3 --> 1:18:5,44
cucumbers like cool weather


1522
1:18:5,44 --> 1:18:7,69
cool as a cucumber


1523
1:18:7,69 --> 1:18:11,6
check out which months you can grow
cucumber


1524
1:18:11,6 --> 1:18:16,909
your season probably ends just as my
cucumber season is beginning


1525
1:18:16,909 --> 1:18:20,919
i bought the parsley known as giant of
italy


1526
1:18:20,919 --> 1:18:25,319
there are sixteen thousand five hundred
seeds in announced for four dollars and


1527
1:18:25,319 --> 1:18:28,5
twenty five cents lower bottom loans


1528
1:18:28,5 --> 1:18:32,51
for some reason this is showing on the
fourteen thousand seeds


1529
1:18:32,51 --> 1:18:36,98
okay i checked and sixteen thousand five
hundred is correct


1530
1:18:36,98 --> 1:18:41,11
so i received a hundred seats for about
two and a half cents


1531
1:18:41,11 --> 1:18:42,5
parsley


1532
1:18:42,5 --> 1:18:45,749
it says zero point zero two five eight


1533
1:18:45,749 --> 1:18:49,239
if the neighbors come over when i see my
lush garden


1534
1:18:49,239 --> 1:18:52,69
i'll give them seeds and tell them to
get busy


1535
1:18:52,69 --> 1:18:56,17
i'll start each neighbor with tendencies
because they probably won't have the


1536
1:18:56,17 --> 1:18:59,499
patience to plant and maintain a garden


1537
1:18:59,499 --> 1:19:2,989
so when they come over allow some of
their governor of the chicken little


1538
1:19:2,989 --> 1:19:3,91
story


1539
1:19:3,91 --> 1:19:8,239
chicken little want some help preparing
some the bread or something i forgot


1540
1:19:8,239 --> 1:19:11,51
whose told to me when i was one year old
something


1541
1:19:11,51 --> 1:19:13,929
back then i didn't take notes


1542
1:19:13,929 --> 1:19:18,399
nobody wanted to help chicken little but
when the soup was made or the bread was


1543
1:19:18,399 --> 1:19:20,92
made everybody wanted to eat


1544
1:19:20,92 --> 1:19:25,87
so chicken little gave them a lecture
you don't help me you don't get any food


1545
1:19:25,87 --> 1:19:29,36
neighbors come over they don't want to
plant anything along the water anything


1546
1:19:29,36 --> 1:19:31,949
they don't want to buy fertilizer


1547
1:19:31,949 --> 1:19:35,719
they don't want to get out in the hot
sun work that garden


1548
1:19:35,719 --> 1:19:40,389
they just want to come over and have you
hand them a basket full of free food


1549
1:19:40,389 --> 1:19:43,159
smith told the chicken little story


1550
1:19:43,159 --> 1:19:43,859
this


1551
1:19:43,859 --> 1:19:48,169
parsley plant has an amazing eight
cycles


1552
1:19:48,169 --> 1:19:52,13
so you're constantly cutting off parsley
in a grows back


1553
1:19:52,13 --> 1:19:53,75
and winner of flowers


1554
1:19:53,75 --> 1:19:55,12
stop cutting it


1555
1:19:55,12 --> 1:19:56,699
that will go to see


1556
1:19:56,699 --> 1:19:59,909
that will give you a thousandth of seeds
per plant


1557
1:19:59,909 --> 1:20:3,909
you can try to get ten cents proceeded
from your chicken shit mayo chicken


1558
1:20:3,909 --> 1:20:5,53
little neighbors


1559
1:20:5,53 --> 1:20:10,36
i can only grow parsley in october
november december and january


1560
1:20:10,36 --> 1:20:15,17
i think the plant will be dead by summer
i'd bought these on sale ten thousand


1561
1:20:15,17 --> 1:20:16,51
spinach suits


1562
1:20:16,51 --> 1:20:21,199
for five dollars so a hundred seats cost
me a nickel


1563
1:20:21,199 --> 1:20:25,2
how much of the spinach plant worth
fifty cents


1564
1:20:25,2 --> 1:20:28,28
i had a potential for a hundred plants


1565
1:20:28,28 --> 1:20:30,2
worth fifty dollars


1566
1:20:30,2 --> 1:20:32,26
and only cost me a nickel


1567
1:20:32,26 --> 1:20:35,52
spinach matures in thirty six days


1568
1:20:35,52 --> 1:20:38,389
fifty dollars and spinach for a nickel


1569
1:20:38,389 --> 1:20:40,269
that's your potential


1570
1:20:40,269 --> 1:20:43,39
now does that work with inflation zaz


1571
1:20:43,39 --> 1:20:44,61
plant a garden


1572
1:20:44,61 --> 1:20:49,26
set up an automatic watering system so
you don't have to labor


1573
1:20:49,26 --> 1:20:54,199
here's your only chance to turned five
dollars into five thousand dollars and


1574
1:20:54,199 --> 1:20:56,619
just thirty six days


1575
1:20:56,619 --> 1:20:58,3
if i had a church


1576
1:20:58,3 --> 1:21:1,659
i have each member of the congregation
plant seeds


1577
1:21:1,659 --> 1:21:5,729
and sell them to finance the pastors
drinking addiction i mean church


1578
1:21:5,729 --> 1:21:9,669
endeavors brainwashing and propaganda
campaign


1579
1:21:9,669 --> 1:21:14,29
these guys senators cycles out knocking
on doors reading scripture


1580
1:21:14,29 --> 1:21:20,61
well all the pastor has to do is make
use of their land to grow savior spinach


1581
1:21:20,61 --> 1:21:23,26
and he's on his way to the kingdom of
heaven


1582
1:21:23,26 --> 1:21:25,719
but these guys are not very smart


1583
1:21:25,719 --> 1:21:29,619
i'm the only one who's really smart and
i know the power of numbers and i know


1584
1:21:29,619 --> 1:21:32,2
how to turn five dollars into


1585
1:21:32,2 --> 1:21:36,99
five thousand dollars in just thirty six
days


1586
1:21:36,99 --> 1:21:40,389
but even if you turn five dollars into
five thousand dollars worth of spinach


1587
1:21:40,389 --> 1:21:42,699
you still haven't sold it


1588
1:21:42,699 --> 1:21:45,1
you still have to have somebody saw it


1589
1:21:45,1 --> 1:21:49,48
the church members would attend a swap
meet and sell their


1590
1:21:49,48 --> 1:21:52,46
and where do you get free labor at the
church


1591
1:21:52,46 --> 1:21:56,32
that's where you'll find the most
gullible suckers that any con man ever


1592
1:21:56,32 --> 1:21:57,939
dreamed of


1593
1:21:57,939 --> 1:22:3,26
the pastor could afford gambling and
prostitution at the same time


1594
1:22:3,26 --> 1:22:7,23
instead he sees knocking on doors as the
only way


1595
1:22:7,23 --> 1:22:9,32
to increases in income


1596
1:22:9,32 --> 1:22:12,469
and so he screams as money out of the
working families


1597
1:22:12,469 --> 1:22:14,629
to finance his sins


1598
1:22:14,629 --> 1:22:18,619
spanish can be cooked and frozen eating
it


1599
1:22:18,619 --> 1:22:20,6
so you don't waste any


1600
1:22:20,6 --> 1:22:22,499
i bought wildfire let us


1601
1:22:22,499 --> 1:22:24,609
a quarter of an ounce


1602
1:22:24,609 --> 1:22:26,62
twenty eight days to maturity


1603
1:22:26,62 --> 1:22:30,99
i got six thousand two hundred and fifty
seeds


1604
1:22:30,99 --> 1:22:32,76
for seven dollars and ninety cents


1605
1:22:32,76 --> 1:22:37,389
so a hundred sears cost me twelve point
six sense


1606
1:22:37,389 --> 1:22:39,949
rounded off state thirteen cents


1607
1:22:39,949 --> 1:22:43,84
is a hundred head of lettuce were
thirteen cents


1608
1:22:43,84 --> 1:22:46,7
that your wholesale price


1609
1:22:46,7 --> 1:22:47,909
but if you cut that let us


1610
1:22:47,909 --> 1:22:49,71
that'll grow back


1611
1:22:49,71 --> 1:22:51,53
and that's what i like about it


1612
1:22:51,53 --> 1:22:52,38
so you can make


1613
1:22:52,38 --> 1:22:55,51
much more than a hundred dollars


1614
1:22:55,51 --> 1:22:57,749
from thirteen cents


1615
1:22:57,749 --> 1:23:1,969
and let us goes to see very much like
cilantro they've both grown about twenty


1616
1:23:1,969 --> 1:23:6,84
four inches tall and then the flowers at
the top turn into seeds


1617
1:23:6,84 --> 1:23:10,42
and you got a shake them into a bag to
collect them


1618
1:23:10,42 --> 1:23:11,33
you don't want to take


1619
1:23:11,33 --> 1:23:12,76
the green ones


1620
1:23:12,76 --> 1:23:15,969
you you take them when they're black and
they're ready to fall off


1621
1:23:15,969 --> 1:23:18,3
the wind will blow them around they'll
be


1622
1:23:18,3 --> 1:23:19,92
parsley everywhere


1623
1:23:19,92 --> 1:23:22,73
the last item in my fifty one dollar
order


1624
1:23:22,73 --> 1:23:24,86
which by the way include shipping


1625
1:23:24,86 --> 1:23:26,719
is a leg room


1626
1:23:26,719 --> 1:23:29,879
allegro mx is the bean family


1627
1:23:29,879 --> 1:23:34,61
here's a picture of many kinds of beans
that only grooms


1628
1:23:34,61 --> 1:23:39,3
well i bought this one llego which is
not being but it's totally ghoom


1629
1:23:39,3 --> 1:23:43,39
and legal means that fixes its on
nitrogen in the soil


1630
1:23:43,39 --> 1:23:47,35
the area's seventy eight percent
nitrogen but it's a triple bonded


1631
1:23:47,35 --> 1:23:48,61
nitrogen


1632
1:23:48,61 --> 1:23:53,309
it's very hard to break but there's a
little bacteria that grows in the bottom


1633
1:23:53,309 --> 1:23:54,679
of legal means


1634
1:23:54,679 --> 1:23:59,34
and that knows how to grab that nitrogen
out of the air and turn it into


1635
1:23:59,34 --> 1:24:0,55
fertilizer


1636
1:24:0,55 --> 1:24:1,999
ammonia or um...


1637
1:24:1,999 --> 1:24:5,739
you re a is actually would turns into
your ria


1638
1:24:5,739 --> 1:24:6,809
very similar


1639
1:24:6,809 --> 1:24:8,84
to the molecule for ammonia


1640
1:24:8,84 --> 1:24:13,249
an h three is ammonium urea i've forgot
form uh... but


1641
1:24:13,249 --> 1:24:19,1
very simple molecule and these little
bacteria grab the direction of the air


1642
1:24:19,1 --> 1:24:23,4
they fixed nitrogen in the soil so you
want to have legal who's around


1643
1:24:23,4 --> 1:24:27,56
plant billions just to get the nitrogen
into the soil


1644
1:24:27,56 --> 1:24:31,98
you need to take the nitrogen out of the
year and put it in the soil because


1645
1:24:31,98 --> 1:24:36,26
nitrogen helps the leaves grow on all
the plants


1646
1:24:36,26 --> 1:24:39,829
phosphorous is good for fruits and
flowers


1647
1:24:39,829 --> 1:24:41,54
phosphorus fruits


1648
1:24:41,54 --> 1:24:42,66
flowers


1649
1:24:42,66 --> 1:24:45,209
and the route plans need potassium


1650
1:24:45,209 --> 1:24:48,32
carrots potatoes turnips radishes


1651
1:24:48,32 --> 1:24:52,53
prudhoe bay is kohlrabi yall need
potassium in the soil


1652
1:24:52,53 --> 1:24:54,539
so when you buy fertilizer


1653
1:24:54,539 --> 1:24:58,739
if you've got your nitrogen covered the
first time there can be as hero


1654
1:24:58,739 --> 1:25:0,239
there's three numbers


1655
1:25:0,239 --> 1:25:4,599
yugos zero sixteen sixteen something
like that the road twenty four twenty


1656
1:25:4,599 --> 1:25:5,559
four


1657
1:25:5,559 --> 1:25:6,969
negative plenty of the


1658
1:25:6,969 --> 1:25:10,79
fruits and flowering mineral classrooms


1659
1:25:10,79 --> 1:25:13,169
new routes in order to grow strong roots
in need


1660
1:25:13,169 --> 1:25:14,429
potassium


1661
1:25:14,429 --> 1:25:19,239
i bought this lay grommets a clover
bought it for the rabbits about fifty


1662
1:25:19,239 --> 1:25:19,94
two


1663
1:25:19,94 --> 1:25:23,99
thousand seeds for less than four
dollars


1664
1:25:23,99 --> 1:25:27,36
and i'm hoping that the bunny rabbits
will love the taste of those and leave


1665
1:25:27,36 --> 1:25:29,62
my swiss sharp alone


1666
1:25:29,62 --> 1:25:31,539
fifty two thousand seeds


1667
1:25:31,539 --> 1:25:35,9
and i don't know how many months a lot
of the year that league room grows i


1668
1:25:35,9 --> 1:25:41,19
hope it grows continuously than the
bunnies can come and eat fresh greens


1669
1:25:41,19 --> 1:25:42,36
healthy greens


1670
1:25:42,36 --> 1:25:44,489
and leave my swiss chard alone


1671
1:25:44,489 --> 1:25:46,59
i have plenty of water


1672
1:25:46,59 --> 1:25:47,3
plenty of land


1673
1:25:47,3 --> 1:25:49,4
complaining of seeds


1674
1:25:49,4 --> 1:25:51,629
have plenty of sunshine in plenty of
heat


1675
1:25:51,629 --> 1:25:53,309
so i'm okay


1676
1:25:53,309 --> 1:25:57,3
i have a watering system that will
deliver water so i can go away


1677
1:25:57,3 --> 1:25:59,4
know that my plans are doing fine


1678
1:25:59,4 --> 1:26:0,32
october


1679
1:26:0,32 --> 1:26:3,989
has twenty two items that i can plant
here in arizona


1680
1:26:3,989 --> 1:26:8,85
but i only bought a few of those items
to test that when watering system


1681

the burden is so heavy now that there's
no chance for social security to survive


1696
1:26:57,46 --> 1:27:1,639
and the government spends so much money
that even if they eliminated all


1697
1:27:1,639 --> 1:27:2,69
spending


1698
1:27:2,69 --> 1:27:6,87
and tax the people one hundred percent
of their incomes they still would not

1:27:6,87 --> 1:27:11,3
have enough money to pay even the
entitlements


1700
1:27:11,3 --> 1:27:14,82

system that is a miserable failure


1707
1:27:34,34 --> 1:27:38,519
and the garden must be for paying
customers only


1708
1:27:38,519 --> 1:27:42,349
the matter of survival in a high
inflationary world


1709
1:27:42,349 --> 1:27:44,38
where prices keep going up


1710
1:27:44,38 --> 1:27:48,429
the federal reserve is to blame for it


1711
1:27:48,429 --> 1:27:50,889
twenty six trillion dollars


1712
1:27:50,889 --> 1:27:54,139
into the money system by just printing
it


1713
1:27:54,139 --> 1:27:58,139
without considering the consequences of
old people


1714
1:27:58,139 --> 1:28:4,4

have a garden just to survive if this is

1:28:11,989 --> 1:28:14,129
