0:0:2,502 --> 0:0:8,541
What if mythology never ended ... 


2
0:0:8,541 --> 0:0:16,549
What if Jesus Christ never existed "... 


3
0:0:16,549 --> 0:0:56,523
What if?

7
0:1:34,561 --> 0:1:38,998
Whether there ever was a Jewish messianic pretender named Joshua or Jesus 


8
0:1:38,998 --> 0:1:45,638
who was crucified at the instigation of his fellow countrymen in the procuratorship of Pontius Pilot, 


9
0:1:45,638 --> 0:1:48,675
we shall probably never know.


10
0:1:48,675 --> 0:1:59,85
It hardly matters. 


11
0:1:59,85 --> 0:2:4,924
The inner council of the Church were aware of secret writings which were not to be promulgated 


12
0:2:4,924 --> 0:2:6,326
even among the faithful. 


13
0:2:6,326 --> 0:2:8,795
A video companion to the book “Astro-theology and Shamanism"

0:2:8,795 --> 0:2:10,93
by Jan Irvin and Andrew Rutajit 


15
0:2:10,93 --> 0:2:15,101
When the second century Church father Clement of Alexandria said, 


16
0:2:15,101 --> 0:2:22,275
not everything that is true needs necessarily to be divulged to all men. 


17

24
0:2:49,569 --> 0:3:6,52
-subtitles: 


25
0:3:6,52 --> 0:3:6,586
voice of Jan Irvin 


26
0:3:6,586 --> 0:3:11,991
It’s no secret that Christmas parties and New Year’s parties promote inebriation with the celebration; 


27
0:3:11,991 --> 0:3:17,397
or at the very least, a toast. 


28
0:3:17,397 --> 0:3:20,333
Inebriation is part of most traditional celebrations 


29
0:3:20,333 --> 0:3:28,474
and it may not surprise you to learn that the combination of inebriation and celebration dates back to our tribal ancestors. 


30
0:3:28,474 --> 0:3:38,985
What may surprise you however, is the fact that modern day religion also has direct ties to ritualistic inebriation. 


31
0:3:38,985 --> 0:3:47,86
These rituals and celebrations throughout antiquity were often annual events 


32
0:3:47,86 --> 0:3:52,665
and these annual events were marked by particular celestial alignments. 


33
0:3:52,665 --> 0:3:54,5
voice of Andrew Rutajit 


34
0:3:54,5 --> 0:3:59,472
Plants and humans have shared this planet together for millions of years. 


35
0:3:59,472 --> 0:4:8,114
Plants have been our never-ending source of food, clothing, & shelter;


36
0:4:8,114 --> 0:4:11,684
and each day as we see the sun rise, 


37
0:4:11,684 --> 0:4:18,391
we know that the sun sustains our life and it sustains the lives of our plant allies. 


38
0:4:18,391 --> 0:4:22,729
However…this magnificent story of the yearly cycle of the sun,


39
0:4:22,729 --> 0:4:29,502
…and the cycles of the moon and stars and the plants have become hidden


40
0:4:29,502 --> 0:4:37,543
These stories have been suppressed for so long that they have become mythology.


41
0:4:37,543 --> 0:4:41,547
And there is another extremely important human/plant relationship 


42
0:4:41,547 --> 0:4:48,955
that has been overlooked for so long, it has become taboo. 


43
0:4:48,955 --> 0:4:52,492
We have laid claim to the term Inebriology which, up until now 


44
0:4:52,492 --> 0:4:57,397
has been a fictitious field of study and a term used by drunken college students. 


45
0:4:57,397 --> 0:5:0,867
But we couldn’t think of a better word 


46
0:5:0,867 --> 0:5:6,973
to describe a study pertaining to the symbolism and the history of ritualistic and celebratory inebriation. 


47
0:5:6,973 --> 0:5:15,348
This involves an in depth study of shamanism and the sacred plants themselves.


48
0:5:15,348 --> 0:5:18,785
Plants, mushrooms and various plant combinations 


49
0:5:18,785 --> 0:5:23,189
have traditionally been used by the shaman or the medicine man for many millennia 


50
0:5:23,189 --> 0:5:30,496
for healing, for extremely deep levels of meditation


51
0:5:30,496 --> 0:5:37,537
and in their ceremonies, and rituals and Rites of Passage as well. 


52
0:5:37,537 --> 0:5:42,942
All of it hidden in language, artwork, myth and tradition. 


53
0:5:42,942 --> 0:5:46,312
And a focus on this artwork, myth and tradition, 


54
0:5:46,312 --> 0:5:49,949
will guide us on our journey thru the ancient mysteries, 


55
0:5:49,949 --> 0:5:56,923
combining the understanding of plant knowledge with celestial knowledge.


56
0:5:56,923 --> 0:6:7,867
"Astrotheology & Shamanism, in Christianity and Other Religions" 


57
0:6:7,867 --> 0:6:12,138
The older, medieval cathedrals were often called Mystery Schools, 


58
0:6:12,138 --> 0:6:17,844
and Mystery Schools were primarily used for religious, mystical, and even scientific study. 


59
0:6:17,844 --> 0:6:24,283
However, there were no congregations…they were not open to the public.


60
0:6:24,283 --> 0:6:28,421
Mystery Schools were structured similar to the way freemasons structure their teachings. 


61
0:6:28,421 --> 0:6:33,526
One enters as an initiate, much like a fraternity, and was often sworn to secrecy.  


62
0:6:33,526 --> 0:6:37,33
In fact, we still have fraternities (and sororities) 


63
0:6:37,33 --> 0:6:39,432
that stem from these ancient mystery schools. 


64
0:6:39,432 --> 0:6:44,437
Modern education’s 12 grades and mortar boards stem from this ancient knowledge. 


65
0:6:44,437 --> 0:6:46,873
In my recent books, in particular 


66
0:6:46,873 --> 0:6:49,208
“The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross”, 


67
0:6:49,208 --> 0:6:52,111
“The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth”, 


68
0:6:52,111 --> 0:6:55,448
and the forthcoming “Physician Heal Thyself”, 


69
0:6:55,448 --> 0:7:3,656
I tried to demonstrate something of the multilayered structure of the Gospel narratives and teachings. 


70
0:7:3,656 --> 0:7:11,197
Their decipherment is difficult, and was intended to be so. 


71
0:7:11,197 --> 0:7:17,67
Just as the Essen secrets were not for the eyes of the uninitiated. 


72
0:7:17,67 --> 0:7:20,873
Even their written works were wrapped up and hidden in caves 


73
0:7:20,873 --> 0:7:28,8
or in a final emergency simply wrenched apart and thrown into a secret underground chamber. 


74
0:7:28,8 --> 0:7:33,92
There most vital mysteries were never committed to writing as Josephus makes clear, 


75
0:7:33,92 --> 0:7:46,833
but passed only by word of mouth under awful oaths of silence.


76
0:7:46,833 --> 0:7:51,537
These Mystery Schools would instruct their members by way of elaborate dramas,


77
0:7:51,537 --> 0:7:57,21
using a play or a metaphor as a method of initiation and education.


78
0:7:57,21 --> 0:8:1,681
So, let’s begin with one of the oldest teachings to ever emerge from the Mystery Schools…


79
0:8:1,681 --> 0:8:3,983
On earth as it is in heaven. 


80
0:8:3,983 --> 0:8:6,385
Another of making this statement is to say 


81
0:8:6,385 --> 0:8:8,54
As above, so below –


82
0:8:8,54 --> 0:8:15,27
it’s an acknowledgment of the polar opposites, light and dark, good and evil, this is yin and yang…


83
0:8:15,27 --> 0:8:17,763
the macrocosm and microcosm.


84
0:8:17,763 --> 0:8:20,9
Philosophy, Alchemy, and many other ancient teachings 


85
0:8:20,9 --> 0:8:26,239
speak of this macrocosm and microcosm - that which is above is also below. 


86
0:8:26,239 --> 0:8:31,43
This relationship of polar opposites is one of the most essential 


87
0:8:31,43 --> 0:8:36,182
-and the most overlooked elements in understanding ancient philosophy and religion. 


88
0:8:36,182 --> 0:8:44,69
The greater and the lesser, the positive and the negative, heaven and hell…..the macrocosm and the microcosm…


89
0:8:44,69 --> 0:8:48,127
These polar opposites are in perfect balance with one another… 


90
0:8:48,127 --> 0:8:53,332
you can think of the Macrocosm Microcosm relationship like octaves on a piano… 


91
0:8:53,332 --> 0:8:59,705
they may vibrate at different frequencies, but they still work in harmony together. 


92
0:8:59,705 --> 0:9:7,78
This is a representation of the Yggdrasil tree, which portrays this concept “that which is above is also below.” 


93
0:9:7,78 --> 0:9:15,121
The tree has branches and leaves aboveground, and it has branching roots borrowing into underground – the chthonic realm. 


94
0:9:15,121 --> 0:9:17,256
As in the heavens, so on earth. 


95
0:9:17,256 --> 0:9:24,597
This dualistic philosophy has been applied all throughout antiquity in religion, alchemy and mysticism.


96
0:9:24,597 --> 0:9:28,868
The constellations in the sky make up the Greatest Story Ever Told 


97
0:9:28,868 --> 0:9:32,905
and among these constellations are the anthropomorphized gods of mythology… 


98
0:9:32,905 --> 0:9:41,38
Gemini, Hercules, Andromeda, Cepheus, and the rest.


99
0:9:41,38 --> 0:9:47,453
Also in the sky are the animals such as Aquila, Hydra, Taurus, Pisces, and so on… 


100
0:9:47,453 --> 0:9:51,39
these aren’t exactly “Anthropomorphisms”, but rather “Zoomorphisms”… 


101
0:9:51,39 --> 0:9:56,429
and were also revered as gods. 


102
0:9:56,429 --> 0:10:4,904
In fact, this is were we get the word “Zodiac” from as Zo comes from the word “Zoo” - Zodiac.


103
0:10:4,904 --> 0:10:9,542
The Bible tells us that although we are mortals, we are gods as well. 


104
0:10:9,542 --> 0:10:17,149
Consequently, this application of the zodiac signs to our bodies occurs in symbolism.


105
0:10:17,149 --> 0:10:18,517
On earth as it is in heaven… 


106
0:10:18,517 --> 0:10:23,155
the temple of god is in the heavens and it dwells within us as well. 


107
0:10:23,155 --> 0:10:29,795
Nevertheless, we create these anthropomorphisms…these gods built out of combinations of nature…


108
0:10:29,795 --> 0:10:36,168
celestial gods, plant gods, fertility gods, or compound gods containing many different elements …


109
0:10:36,168 --> 0:10:42,141
and they were often worshiped and written about as though they were living deities.


110
0:10:42,141 --> 0:10:49,548
Even if there was a sectarian Jewish teacher living in Palestine during the first part of the first century 


111
0:10:49,548 --> 0:10:58,124
called Joshua or Jesus he had nothing at all to do with the crucified Christos of Paul’s theology 


112
0:10:58,124 --> 0:11:7,33
and thus had no part to play in the formation of that distinctive amalgam of faiths that eventually swept the world. 


113
0:11:7,33 --> 0:11:13,639
As far as the gospel narratives of Jesus are concerned we can free ourselves for ever from the need 


114
0:11:13,639 --> 0:11:22,682
to lay bear a reality on which to base a more historically convincing portrait of a first century teacher 


115
0:11:22,682 --> 0:11:27,987
who in three short years was supposed to have founded a new religion 


116
0:11:27,987 --> 0:11:43,602
or so transformed an existing messianic faith that it could become almost immediately acceptable to a Gentile world.


117
0:11:43,602 --> 0:11:48,507
We’re dealing with myth, not history. 


118
0:11:48,507 --> 0:12:4,356
The question we now have to ask is “What was the nature and purpose of that myth.


119
0:12:4,356 --> 0:12:9,895
Sol Invictus is often referred to as Mithra because of their strong correlation.


120
0:12:9,895 --> 0:12:14,233
In fact the Persian and Roman sun god Mithra, in the Mithraic Kronos 


121
0:12:14,233 --> 0:12:16,802
-or Personification of Infinite Time- 


122
0:12:16,802 --> 0:12:26,212
is in the center of the zodiac; he is surrounded by his 12 helpers or the 12 helpers of the sun.


123
0:12:26,212 --> 0:12:33,419
You will often find a goddess, a sun, or some sort of divine entity inside the zodiac when depicted in art. 


124
0:12:33,419 --> 0:12:39,759
There are even old paintings and murals of Christ sitting on a throne surrounded by his 12 helpers, 


125
0:12:39,759 --> 0:12:44,463
sometimes these are depicted as 12 angels and other times the 12 disciples. 


126
0:12:44,463 --> 0:12:55,207
We’ve even found some that are depicted as the 12 signs of the zodiac. 


127
0:12:55,207 --> 0:12:59,845
The important thing to know about the deity is that the deity is merely a character. 


128
0:12:59,845 --> 0:13:6,218
It is the character’s characteristics and the physical posture that are important.


129
0:13:6,218 --> 0:13:12,792
The name of the character can be interchanged and applied to different cultures and Ages, 


130
0:13:12,792 --> 0:13:17,329
but numerous characteristics have remained the same in various deities, 


131
0:13:17,329 --> 0:13:25,7
including Christ, Krishna, Horus, Mithra, Buddha, Quetzalcoatl and many others. 


132
0:13:25,7 --> 0:13:28,34
Many of these characteristics represent this “star of wonder”. 


133
0:13:28,34 --> 0:13:35,314
This only begotten son of the creator…God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God…


134
0:13:35,314 --> 0:13:37,383
begotten not made…


135
0:13:37,383 --> 0:13:40,352
in other words, and as Jordan Maxwell like to point out, 


136
0:13:40,352 --> 0:13:50,196
this ball of light in the sky is not our responsibility it’s God’s responsibility, it’s not our son, it’s God’s sun.


137
0:13:50,196 --> 0:14:0,239
This worshipful sun is the main star of all stars; it’s the only star that is of real importance to us because it gives us our life. 


138
0:14:0,239 --> 0:14:8,814
Likewise, in this macrocosmic personification, the sun and all other stars in the sky are Kings…


139
0:14:8,814 --> 0:14:14,753
Making Jesus, Horus, and all other “sun Gods” the King of kings. 


140
0:14:14,753 --> 0:14:22,261
Mythology never ended, Jesus is the newest myth and most people are smart enough to know this fact, Η μυθολογία 


141
0:14:22,261 --> 0:14:28,334
but so many are just too frightened to face it.


142
0:14:28,334 --> 0:14:32,872
The animals in my house tend to follow the warm sunlight around the house in the morning time.  


143
0:14:32,872 --> 0:14:41,513
These splashes of sun on the floor are in different locations at 7am in the spring, verses 7am in the fall.  


144
0:14:41,513 --> 0:14:45,684
It’s the tilting of the earth’s axis that brings about these seasonal changes. 


145
0:14:45,684 --> 0:14:54,226
And as simple of a concept as this may be, this is the gateway to some of religion’s most guarded mysteries.


146
0:14:54,226 --> 0:15:1,834
If you film, video tape, or even take a time lapse photograph of the north eastern section of the night’s sky on a clear night, 


147
0:15:1,834 --> 0:15:10,109
you will see the apparent rotation of the stars around the North Star as the earth rotates on its axis. 


148
0:15:10,109 --> 0:15:23,756
But notice, as these stars appear to spin in a circle, the stars on the Eastern horizon appear to rise just like the sun does. 


149
0:15:23,756 --> 0:15:27,76
Before there were calendars and long before there were street lights on every corner, 


150
0:15:27,76 --> 0:15:32,765
one could watch the night’s sky and know when to prepare for winter or when to plant the crops. 


151
0:15:32,765 --> 0:15:35,267
However, today, with our bright lights and big cities,


152
0:15:35,267 --> 0:15:40,439
It is growing more and more difficult to see these stars at night due to something called light pollution. 


153
0:15:40,439 --> 0:15:42,808
Our ancestors didn’t have this problem; Οι πρόγονοί μας δεν είχαν αυτό το πρόβημα.


154
0:15:42,808 --> 0:15:51,183
their mystery schools, celebrations and rituals were centered upon these yearly and easily observed, celestial cycles 


155
0:15:51,183 --> 0:15:57,456
and the night’s sky would come to life with its stars.


156
0:15:57,456 --> 0:16:4,897
In order to better understand these yearly celestial cycles, let’s begin in spring. 


157
0:16:4,897 --> 0:16:12,972
At 8:30 a.m. we see that the sun is above the horizon and behind it is the constellation Pisces.


158
0:16:12,972 --> 0:16:23,816
As we fast-forward to autumn, we notice that the sun appears to remain in the same region of the sky at this particular time of day. 


159
0:16:23,816 --> 0:16:33,959
And if we fast forward two months, we see that the sun appears to be in a completely new location at this exact same time of morning. 


160
0:16:33,959 --> 0:16:39,164
When we superimpose the position of the sun at 8:30AM in early autumn,


161
0:16:39,164 --> 0:16:47,373
with the position of the sun on Christmas morning - at the same time of day - the movement is obvious. 


162
0:16:47,373 --> 0:16:52,745
This “falling” occurs under the sign of Scorpio in the autumn.


163
0:16:52,745 --> 0:16:59,218
The scorpion is a back biter; it can betray you by looking you in the eye while it stings you with its tail.


164
0:16:59,218 --> 0:17:5,424
When stung, the bite of a scorpion can resemble two lips, like a kiss.


165
0:17:5,424 --> 0:17:10,62
This is symbolized in scripture with the story of Judas. Judas betrays Jesus with a kiss. 


166
0:17:10,62 --> 0:17:20,873
From this point forward, Jesus is symbolically falling to his death.


167
0:17:20,873 --> 0:17:24,877
And in nature from this point forward, from our earthly perspective, 


168
0:17:24,877 --> 0:17:30,215
the sun appears to be rising on the horizon closer and closer to the south each day… 


169
0:17:30,215 --> 0:17:36,321
it has been falling to its death since its brush with the scorpion. 


170
0:17:36,321 --> 0:17:41,994
Every day, it has been moving further and further to the south. 


171
0:17:41,994 --> 0:17:47,833
The days are getting shorter and shorter, the nights are getting longer and longer, and it’s getting colder and colder.


172
0:17:47,833 --> 0:17:56,542
On the first day of the winter solstice, December 21st, the sun will not only cease its apparent descent into this abyss, 


173
0:17:56,542 --> 0:18:0,746
is also stops this southerly movement. 


174
0:18:0,746 --> 0:18:13,826
For three days, the sun will appear to rise on the horizon in the exact same place. 


175
0:18:13,826 --> 0:18:25,7
No longer does it appear to fall…because “fall” has ended 


176
0:18:25,7 --> 0:18:31,343
After the sun has appeared to be dead for three days, having not moved in its usual fashion, 


177
0:18:31,343 --> 0:18:46,792
it begins to move in the opposite direction – to the north…and the cycle continues.


178
0:18:46,792 --> 0:18:50,62
And depending on the earth’s yearly angle with the sun,


179
0:18:50,62 --> 0:18:55,434
if you lived above the 66.5 to 67 degree latitude line, 


180
0:18:55,434 --> 0:19:1,74
you would notice during the three days of the sun’s symbolic death, that there is no sun in the sky. 


181
0:19:1,74 --> 0:19:8,914
In this part of the world, which just so happens to be the part of the world where our Norse traditions of the Christmas holiday come from, 


182
0:19:8,914 --> 0:19:21,593
the sun will remain below the horizon (in the chthonic realm, sometimes called hell) for three days.


183
0:19:21,593 --> 0:19:24,129
These are all allegories of our Day Star. 


184
0:19:24,129 --> 0:19:29,34
Ironically, the term “Day Star” has been adopted by many Christian Churches around the world. 


185
0:19:29,34 --> 0:19:32,871
Jesus is the day-star, the King of kings. 


186
0:19:32,871 --> 0:19:39,378
Another star that challenged this day star for the light of the morning was called the “Morning Star,” 


187
0:19:39,378 --> 0:19:41,98
known to us today as the planet Venus. 
γνωστό σε μας σήμερα ως ο πλανήτης Αφροδίτη.


188
0:19:41,98 --> 0:19:52,991
Because this morning star challenged the light of our sun, the day star, or “Jesus,” it was known as “Lucifer.”


189
0:19:52,991 --> 0:19:59,464
What is the significance of being born under a star?


190
0:19:59,464 --> 0:20:6,104
Horus was born under a star to the virgin Isis. 


191
0:20:6,104 --> 0:20:10,576
Jesus was also said to have also been born under a star to a virgin mother. 


192
0:20:10,576 --> 0:20:19,51
This is all part of a microcosmic personification of an event occurring in the sky in the early morning hours of December 25.


193
0:20:19,51 --> 0:20:30,963
It is a clever way to represent that which is above, and that which is below, by depicting the actual star and the personified deity. 


194
0:20:30,963 --> 0:20:36,935
Our ancestors created entire cultures and mitolog'as around these ideas, known as Astroteolog'a 


195
0:20:36,935 --> 0:20:41,6
And because the heavens reflect the will of the Great Architect, 


196
0:20:41,6 --> 0:20:48,714
man has been in constant attempt to reproduce on earth what is seen in the heavens.


197
0:20:48,714 --> 0:20:56,822
In the typical Christian version of this story, three wise men follow this star to the birth of the newborn savior.


198
0:20:56,822 --> 0:21:2,194
What is this star; who are these “wise men,” or three kings following it, 


199
0:21:2,194 --> 0:21:7,766
and does this star somehow lead these three kings to the birth of a sun god? 


200
0:21:7,766 --> 0:21:17,743
The answers to these questions are literally written in the stars.


201
0:21:17,743 --> 0:21:26,852
During the Christmas season you can go outside at night and look to the east and there on the horizon you can see the real three kings of the east. 


202
0:21:26,852 --> 0:21:30,789
And they will be following the brightest star in the sky. 


203
0:21:30,789 --> 0:21:35,36
These stars mark the location where the sun will rise on Christmas Day. 


204
0:21:35,36 --> 0:21:43,68
This was even more obvious 2000 years ago when these legends began, but can still easily be seen today.


205
0:21:43,68 --> 0:21:47,39
These stars will not be in this location at other times of the year, 


206
0:21:47,39 --> 0:21:55,847
they sweep down to form this alignment during the solstice, or during the Christmas season.


207
0:21:55,847 --> 0:22:0,319
It is rather precise actually, and you can see it with your own eyes.


208
0:22:0,319 --> 0:22:6,291
If you go outside during the evening in mid December, look to the eastern horizon 


209
0:22:6,291 --> 0:22:11,129
and wait until you see Orion’s belt rise on the horizon, 


210
0:22:11,129 --> 0:22:16,568
you’ll notice it’s been dark for quite sometime while you wait for this to happen.


211
0:22:16,568 --> 0:22:21,54
But if we wait one month and go outside during the evening in mid January, 


212
0:22:21,54 --> 0:22:27,846
the sky will look completely different. 


213
0:22:27,846 --> 0:22:33,819
Now, when you look to the eastern horizon and wait until you see Orion’s belt rising on the horizon,


214
0:22:33,819 --> 0:22:43,161
you will notice that it is too light outside to see any stars and Orion’s belt can not be seen on the horizonθα 


215
0:22:43,161 --> 0:22:51,303
But if we go back to December 24th, Christmas Eve, and you go outside and you wait until you see Orion’s belt appear on the Eastern Horizon


216
0:22:51,303 --> 0:23:1,113
you will notice that these three stars appear to begin their journey across the sky immediately at dusk. 


217
0:23:1,113 --> 0:23:11,289
This constellation rises on the horizon just when the sky is dark enough to expose the stars. 


218
0:23:11,289 --> 0:23:24,436
These stars travel further across the night’s sky on Christmas Eve than they do any other night. 


219
0:23:24,436 --> 0:23:37,482
On this midnight, also on the eastern horizon, you will see Virgo, the Virgin, peeking her head above the horizon.


220
0:23:37,482 --> 0:23:43,789
by 3:30AM on Christmas morning, the virgin is completely above the horizon


221
0:23:43,789 --> 0:23:56,868
She then takes her position; she prepares to symbolically give birth 
Μετά παίρνει την θέση της. Ετοιμάζεται να γεννήσει συμβολικά
222 
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:54,266 
to the sun after stepping on the head of the Serpens, the celestial serpent, with her foot.


222
0:23:56,868 --> 0:24:0,739
The morning sun will rise just below Virgo on this particular morning, 


223
0:24:0,739 --> 0:24:2,941
as though she were giving birth to it. 


224
0:24:2,941 --> 0:24:9,848
The mythological birth of the sun god - Born of a Virgin. 


225
0:24:9,848 --> 0:24:24,129
After the sunrise on Christmas morning, the bird, Aquila will appear to be standing on the sun. 


226
0:24:24,129 --> 0:24:33,38
If we swing around to the west at this very moment, we will see the serpent, Hydra, winding its way around the horizon. 


227
0:24:33,38 --> 0:24:38,143
This brings us back to the symbol of the Yggdrasil tree with the bird above and the serpent below. 


228
0:24:38,143 --> 0:24:46,218
This symbol will be predominant throughout this video.  


229
0:24:46,218 --> 0:24:49,254
The tree is now branching out into the heavens above the earth. 


230
0:24:49,254 --> 0:24:55,36
Symbolically, the Yggdrasil tree is growing to represent the world tree…


231
0:24:55,36 --> 0:24:57,596
The further we zoom out from this philosophy, 


232
0:24:57,596 --> 0:25:2,634
the Yggdrasil tree becomes the Axis mundi otherwise known as the axis of the earth; 


233
0:25:2,634 --> 0:25:6,404
branching out into the stars and churning the milky heavens. 


234
0:25:6,404 --> 0:25:11,42
This is symbolic of the polar opposites of the earth.


235
0:25:11,42 --> 0:25:16,515
Because the earth is tilted on an axis, the stars appear to rotate around the North Star at night. 


236
0:25:16,515 --> 0:25:19,217
Not only does the earth spin upon this axis, 


237
0:25:19,217 --> 0:25:26,424
but due to the gravitational pull of the sun, moon, and other planets, it also wobbles like a top on this axis. 


238
0:25:26,424 --> 0:25:39,404
One complete wobble has been called a ‘Great Year,’ ‘Stellar Year’, a ‘Planetary Year’ and ‘The Precession of the Equinoxes.’ 


239
0:25:39,404 --> 0:25:45,143
One complete Great Year takes roughly 25,800 years; 


240
0:25:45,143 --> 0:25:50,749
…this 25,800-year period is divided into the 12 houses of the zodiac


241
0:25:50,749 --> 0:25:53,184
making 12 Ages. 


242
0:25:53,184 --> 0:25:59,991
Just as a normal year is divided into the 12 houses of the zodiac – to make 12 months.


243
0:25:59,991 --> 0:26:7,699
As a result, we enter a new “Great Month” or new Age every 2,150 years. 


244
0:26:7,699 --> 0:26:11,97
Just as a normal year has twelve months, the great year has 12 Ages 


245
0:26:11,97 --> 0:26:16,441
and they are marked with the exact same signs that we are all familiar with.


246
0:26:16,441 --> 0:26:20,445
But unlike the commonly understood procession of the equinoxes, 


247
0:26:20,445 --> 0:26:26,785
which runs forward through the zodiac in the normal monthly progression, or procession 


248
0:26:26,785 --> 0:26:29,421
during the precession of the equinoxes,


249
0:26:29,421 --> 0:26:33,291
…we go backward through the zodiac as we enter new Ages. 


250
0:26:33,291 --> 0:26:35,827
By working our way backwards through the zodiac,


251
0:26:35,827 --> 0:26:45,904
we may begin to understand how the signs of the zodiac have affected symbolism throughout history.  


252
0:26:45,904 --> 0:26:49,4
Everybody knows that Christianity’s a kind of Judaism,


253
0:26:49,4 --> 0:26:53,645
a very extreme almost ridiculous form of Judaism. 


254
0:26:53,645 --> 0:26:59,5
The messiah given a quite non-Jewish slant and so on and so forth.


255
0:26:59,5 --> 0:27:8,827
To a religious historian, most important thing is to know is where these ideas came from and how they were fused.


256
0:27:8,827 --> 0:27:11,963
All of the zodiac signs are governed by the four elements. 


257
0:27:11,963 --> 0:27:16,167
Earth and water are elements that are considered to be feminine in nature. 


258
0:27:16,167 --> 0:27:18,67
We’ve all heard the earth being called mother. 


259
0:27:18,67 --> 0:27:27,679
Another name for the seas is marine taken from Latin mare, or mari, meaning sea. 


260
0:27:27,679 --> 0:27:32,183
So this feminine – water-bound sign marking the Age of Cancer can be seen as 


261
0:27:32,183 --> 0:27:36,221
a representation of the matrilineal structures of that Age. 


262
0:27:36,221 --> 0:27:41,226
Call it a coincidence but before some six-thousand to seven-thousand years ago, 


263
0:27:41,226 --> 0:27:45,563
we were mostly matrilineal and egalitarian in our social structuring. 


264
0:27:45,563 --> 0:27:56,908
It was an egalitarian society, where men committed to the society as a whole because of the matrilineal structuring. 


265
0:27:56,908 --> 0:27:59,411
The end of the age of Gemini – with the twins –


266
0:27:59,411 --> 0:28:7,652
also happens to mark the time period of the end of matrilineal, egalitarian social structuring where males and females were equals… 


267
0:28:7,652 --> 0:28:10,922
twins, so to speak


268
0:28:10,922 --> 0:28:15,26
The bull then became a symbol of patriarchy about the time of the Age of Taurus, 


269
0:28:15,26 --> 0:28:19,164
symbolized by Lord Krishna with a bull. 


270
0:28:19,164 --> 0:28:22,67
Bulls were also sacred in the patriarchal Egypt.


271
0:28:22,67 --> 0:28:25,67
And in ancient Persia and Rome, in many statues and paintings, 


272
0:28:25,67 --> 0:28:30,575
you will see Mithra stabbing the Bull, taking humankind out of the Age of the bull –


273
0:28:30,575 --> 0:28:37,615
or rather, out of the Age of Taurus.


274
0:28:37,615 --> 0:28:44,422
The stories in the Bible tell us that Moses came down from the mountain with the tablets of the new law on two separate occasions. 


275
0:28:44,422 --> 0:28:47,792
The first time he came down the mountain with the new law, 


276
0:28:47,792 --> 0:28:52,497
…he noticed that his people had fashioned a golden calf and were worshiping it.   


277
0:28:52,497 --> 0:29:0,739
Moses gets angry with this and throws the tablets against the rocks, literally breaking the law. 


278
0:29:0,739 --> 0:29:3,274
Sometimes, you will find artwork of the Ten Commandments 


279
0:29:3,274 --> 0:29:6,644
showing the bull in the background with a sun disk between his horns


280
0:29:6,644 --> 0:29:9,948
similar to Apis of Egypt, or the zodiac sign Taurus the Bull.


281
0:29:9,948 --> 0:29:13,518
When Moses and the Jews are blowing the shofar to the heavens in praise, 


282
0:29:13,518 --> 0:29:15,487
they are using a ram’s horn. 


283
0:29:15,487 --> 0:29:18,89
They are worshiping their lord by the use of a ram. 


284
0:29:18,89 --> 0:29:26,865
Moses is often depicted with horns coming out of his head as a representation of Aries, the ram. 


285
0:29:26,865 --> 0:29:33,171
This head of Moses most resembles that of biblical tradition and biblical tradition reflects the old mystery schools. 


286
0:29:33,171 --> 0:29:41,88
The wrinkled face and heavy eyebrows, the forehead bearing horns in accordance with the tradition of mystery-play actors…


287
0:29:41,88 --> 0:29:46,785
In other words, the story of the sun and stars was kept alive in these mystery schools, 


288
0:29:46,785 --> 0:29:54,893
one of the characters was Moses, and he represented the Ram of Aries by showing him with ram’s horns on his head.


289
0:29:54,893 --> 0:30:6,204
This filtered down into religious traditions by showing Moses, with horns on his head, or his followers blowing the rams horn in worship.


290
0:30:6,204 --> 0:30:8,506
This is not some form of devil worship. 


291
0:30:8,506 --> 0:30:16,815
It is symbolic of the Age of Aries. The previous Age was Taurus, the Bull. 


292
0:30:16,815 --> 0:30:24,355
This is the bull – or rather, the Age which the Moses character was leading his people away from.


293
0:30:24,355 --> 0:30:28,793
This Age of the Ram ended with the slaughter of the Ram when Father Abraham, 


294
0:30:28,793 --> 0:30:35,66
the Father of Christianity, slaughtered a Ram instead of his son. 


295
0:30:35,66 --> 0:30:38,67
Just as Mithra kills the bull to usher in the Age of the Ram, 


296
0:30:38,67 --> 0:30:45,276
Abraham kills the ram of Aries to usher in the next Age – the Age of Pisces .


297
0:30:45,276 --> 0:30:49,981
Jesus takes us out of the Age of Aries and into Pisces. 


298
0:30:49,981 --> 0:30:51,983
And what was his first miracle? 


299
0:30:51,983 --> 0:31:2,66
He turns regular water into wine and feeds the masses with two fish…these represent the two fish of Pisces.


300
0:31:2,66 --> 0:31:5,563
Jesus was the Fisher of Men 


301
0:31:5,563 --> 0:31:14,305
Christians today often put a fish symbol on the back of their car or on their clothes.


302
0:31:14,305 --> 0:31:18,81
The pope’s miter is a fish head. 


303
0:31:18,81 --> 0:31:28,353
…looking exactly like fish heads - representing the Age of Pisces….the Age of Christianity….The Age of the Fish.


304
0:31:28,353 --> 0:31:30,822
Even the clergy reflect this age. 


305
0:31:30,822 --> 0:31:37,795
But the symbol, the symbol of the fish comes from the vesica, the vesica piscus or the vesica Pisces.


306
0:31:37,795 --> 0:31:46,871
The Vesica is a symbol of the spiritual portal which emerges from the harmonious balance of two complementary polarities; 


307
0:31:46,871 --> 0:31:55,813
intuition and intellect, knowledge and practice, yin and yang, heaven and earth, spirit and science.


308
0:31:55,813 --> 0:32:2,82
It’s two complimentary polarities that create this spiritual portal. 


309
0:32:2,82 --> 0:32:9,861
If you consider its shape, it is a spiritual portal. It is the shape of the yoni. 


310
0:32:9,861 --> 0:32:14,165
We must have this spiritual portal in order to exist. 


311
0:32:14,165 --> 0:32:19,137
The only way for us to enter into this dimension is thru this portal 


312
0:32:19,137 --> 0:32:23,908
which emerges from the harmonious balance of two complimentary polarities, 


313
0:32:23,908 --> 0:32:33,851
male and female, as we enter into this dimension thru this spiritual portal.


314
0:32:33,851 --> 0:32:44,228
Our Lady of Guadalupe is often seen standing inside this symbol – of the vesica.


315
0:32:44,228 --> 0:32:50,134
Pagan traditions will have people being drawn thru this symbol,  


316
0:32:50,134 --> 0:32:59,243
physically drawn thru this symbol as they are said to have been born again, born into this cult or into this family. 


317
0:32:59,243 --> 0:33:4,182
So just to bring a close to the talk of ages and coming to the end of an age. 


318
0:33:4,182 --> 0:33:12,523
In Mathew 28:20 Jesus says that “I am with you always, to the very end of the Age”. 


319
0:33:12,523 --> 0:33:24,268
So when the age ends, well, I’m with you always, to the end of the Age. So there is an Age to come.


320
0:33:24,268 --> 0:33:32,91
Luke tells us that there is an age to come… in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life


321
0:33:32,91 --> 0:33:37,615
in the Age and the world which are to come. (Ephesians 1:21) … not only in this age and in this world, but also in the age and the world which are to come. 


322
0:33:37,615 --> 0:33:44,789
The New Testament


323
0:33:44,789 --> 0:33:50,561
So if Jesus is with us to the end of the Age and this Age is about to end,


324
0:33:50,561 --> 0:33:52,563
is this reflected in the Bible? 


325
0:33:52,563 --> 0:34:1,339
And it is, as Jesus is about to be crucified, the end of Jesus in the Bible, 


326
0:34:1,339 --> 0:34:7,712
Jesus is about to be crucified he is going to have his last meal or the Last Supper.


327
0:34:7,712 --> 0:34:13,84
And the day came of the unleavened bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed


328
0:34:13,84 --> 0:34:20,425
and Jesus sent Peter and John saying go make preparations for us to eat the Passover, this is the last supper 


329
0:34:20,425 --> 0:34:27,632
and they replied saying where do you want us to prepare for it? Where are we going to prepare this last meal for you?


330
0:34:27,632 --> 0:34:32,36
Jesus said to them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, 


331
0:34:32,36 --> 0:34:36,207
there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in. 


332
0:34:36,207 --> 0:34:42,18
Symbolically this is stating that you will recognize the new Age by a man bearing a pitcher of water. 


333
0:34:42,18 --> 0:34:47,251
You will follow him into the house. Houses are the houses of the Zodiac.


334
0:34:47,251 --> 0:34:56,828
This house is represented by a man bearing a pitcher of water and that is exactly what the Age of Aquarius is, is the man with a water pitcher. 


335
0:34:56,828 --> 0:35:1,666
You don’t see men in history bearing water you see the women fetching the water,


336
0:35:1,666 --> 0:35:9,14
the woman at the well, women with the water pot on their head so a man carrying a water pot is symbolic. 


337
0:35:9,14 --> 0:35:16,147
It’s symbolic of perhaps a return, a slow return to egalitarianism.


338
0:35:16,147 --> 0:35:22,32
Abraham was going to stab his son but instead he ends up stabbing the ram. 


339
0:35:22,32 --> 0:35:28,159
Just as Mithras was stabbing the bull and Jesus was stabbed on the cross. 


340
0:35:28,159 --> 0:35:33,564
When Jesus was stabbed on the cross, his blood was collected in a cup.


341
0:35:33,564 --> 0:35:41,272
This cup has been a long sought after treasure for many people throughout the Ages. 


342
0:35:41,272 --> 0:35:46,711
We’re going to talk about this cup. We’re going to talk about the body and the blood now. 


343
0:35:46,711 --> 0:35:55,987
This is a good segue into communion where Christians will participate in a ritual, a blood drinking ritual - a mock blood drinking 


344
0:35:55,987 --> 0:36:3,427
and flesh eating ritual. And this is why they do this is because this verse in the bible.


345
0:36:3,427 --> 0:36:6,197
(Matthew 26:26-27) And as they were eating it, Jesus took bread and He blessed it. 


346
0:36:6,197 --> 0:36:12,67
And he broke it and gave it to his disciples, and said, 
348 
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,602 
"Take, eat; this is my body." 


347
0:36:12,67 --> 0:36:16,507
And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, 


348
0:36:16,507 --> 0:36:28,853
"Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."


349
0:36:28,853 --> 0:36:47,38
It is a bit strange that people continue these rituals today without really knowing the origin of just exactly where these things come from.


350
0:36:47,38 --> 0:36:54,178
This can cross the line into offensive territory, but this is forewarned in the Bible because:


351
0:36:54,178 --> 0:37:0,518
John 6:52-56 - the Jews began to argue sharply amongst themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat? 


352
0:37:0,518 --> 0:37:8,459
And Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man 


353
0:37:8,459 --> 0:37:11,596
and drink his blood, you have no life in you. 


354
0:37:11,596 --> 0:37:18,669
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. 


355
0:37:18,669 --> 0:37:22,807
For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. 


356
0:37:22,807 --> 0:37:29,714
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.”


357
0:37:29,714 --> 0:37:37,388
Upon hearing this many of his disciples said “this is a hard teaching who can accept it?


358
0:37:37,388 --> 0:37:43,628
And aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them “Does this offend you?”


359
0:37:43,628 --> 0:37:47,798
The physical body and the blood part that’s the symbolic part. 


360
0:37:47,798 --> 0:37:58,376
But before we can get into this, we need to understand the Dead Sea Scrolls.


361
0:37:58,376 --> 0:38:1,12
The Dead Sea Scrolls are a collection of ancient writings 


362
0:38:1,12 --> 0:38:3,814
containing nearly all of the Old Testament. 


363
0:38:3,814 --> 0:38:10,655
They were discovered in caves near the Dead Sea and Qumran from 1947 into the mid-1950s. 


364
0:38:10,655 --> 0:38:14,725
This caused immense anticipation from Christians everywhere as


365
0:38:14,725 --> 0:38:20,31
the scrolls were thought to be a guarantee for the church to prove Christianity correct.


366
0:38:20,31 --> 0:38:27,305
It appeared as though the only thing left to do was to read and interpret the scrolls and Christians would have all the proof they needed…


367
0:38:27,305 --> 0:38:30,941
…this was because the Dead Sea Scrolls were written in Semitic


368
0:38:30,941 --> 0:38:35,546
in the language of Aramaic between 250 BCE and 136 CE; 


369
0:38:35,546 --> 0:38:39,45
this was the era that the Jesus character was said to be walking the earth.


370
0:38:39,45 --> 0:38:47,224
To find scrolls written in “His language,” during the period of time in which he was said to be living, was a major finding – 


371
0:38:47,224 --> 0:38:52,496
and Christians everywhere were very excited about this.


372
0:38:52,496 --> 0:38:58,769
So, what did the scrolls say? Did they read like newspaper headlines speaking of a Jesus of Nazareth? 


373
0:38:58,769 --> 0:39:1,739
These were questions that had to be answered… 


374
0:39:1,739 --> 0:39:8,245
consequently; the best of the best were called upon by the Church for their translation skills. 


375
0:39:8,245 --> 0:39:17,154
John Marco Allegro was a researcher in philology who had graduated with a first-class honors degree in Oriental Studies from University of Manchester. 


376
0:39:17,154 --> 0:39:20,358
He had earlier begun training for the Methodist ministry, 


377
0:39:20,358 --> 0:39:28,566
but had left to pursue the degree course when he found that studying biblical languages was making him question the foundations of his Christian belief. 


378
0:39:28,566 --> 0:39:36,273
While working towards a doctorate at Oxford, he was invited to join the original Scrolls editing team in 
1953. 


379
0:39:36,273 --> 0:39:40,77
In 1954, he became an assistant lecturer at the University of Manchester. 


380
0:39:40,77 --> 0:39:45,349
Considered an up-and-coming philologist in regards to Middle Eastern and Mediterranean languages, 


381
0:39:45,349 --> 0:39:50,688
Allegro was the only agnostic on the international team of Dead Sea Scrolls translators. 


382
0:39:50,688 --> 0:40:2,266
Most of the other members of this so-called “international” scrolls team were ordained Catholic priests… 


383
0:40:2,266 --> 0:40:8,339
The work of this team, which was organized by Father De Vaux, was originally supposed to be published 


384
0:40:8,339 --> 0:40:12,376
as soon as possible and open to scholarly interpretation. 


385
0:40:12,376 --> 0:40:17,314
John Allegro was the only member to publish all his translations in learned journals 


386
0:40:17,314 --> 0:40:21,185
as soon as he felt they were ready to be laid open to scrutiny.  


387
0:40:21,185 --> 0:40:27,91
The other members of the team tended to hold onto their allocations for so long that some people


388
0:40:27,91 --> 0:40:33,197
–including Allegro from time to time–suspected a cover-up and suppression of the research. 


389
0:40:33,197 --> 0:40:39,837
In fact, Allegro was asked several times to hold back on some of his translations for several years…


390
0:40:39,837 --> 0:40:42,273
or face retribution. 


391
0:40:42,273 --> 0:40:45,543
He sometimes unwillingly complied.


392
0:40:45,543 --> 0:40:46,377
voice of John Marco Allegro 


393
0:40:46,377 --> 0:40:52,316
If not a cover up, an unwillingness to tell all, all at once. 


394
0:40:52,316 --> 0:40:56,62
There always was a feeling that if we go carefully 


395
0:40:56,62 --> 0:41:4,128
we can release the information in a way that need generate no hostility or over questioning. 


396
0:41:4,128 --> 0:41:9,133
But we will do, we will control it. 


397
0:41:9,133 --> 0:41:17,341
By 1968, Allegro completed and published all of his translations of the Cave 4 scroll fragments assigned to him.


398
0:41:17,341 --> 0:41:26,25
In the 15 years since the international team was put together in 1953, Allegro was the only member to finish his assigned duty. 


399
0:41:26,25 --> 0:41:33,57
The remaining scrolls were not published until 1991, when the Huntington Library in San Marino CA


400
0:41:33,57 --> 0:41:38,329
finally released photographs of the scrolls in order to expedite their publication. 


401
0:41:38,329 --> 0:41:47,638
The other members of the original team held onto  most of their translations until after 1997 – which was 29 years…


402
0:41:47,638 --> 0:41:55,212
or more… after Allegro, and 50 years…or more…. since the original discovery of the first scrolls in 1947. 


403
0:41:55,212 --> 0:42:4,755
During this time, scholars who attempted to question the orthodox view (as Allegro found out) had their careers destroyed.


404
0:42:4,755 --> 0:42:7,57
There is much to learn about John Allegro. 


405
0:42:7,57 --> 0:42:12,296
He was the only member who wasn’t a committed Christian and considered himself agnostic. 


406
0:42:12,296 --> 0:42:17,801
An agnostic is someone who doesn’t believe in nor against any religious philosophy, 


407
0:42:17,801 --> 0:42:23,274
and this placed Allegro at an unbiased advantage over the rest of the Dead Sea Scrolls team. 


408
0:42:23,274 --> 0:42:28,679
The other men, unlike Allegro, had a vested interested in maintaining the status quo – 


409
0:42:28,679 --> 0:42:34,451
that Jesus was a real man, and that the Scrolls in no way threatened the foundations of Christianity. 


410
0:42:34,451 --> 0:42:39,523
Because of Allegro’s differing ideas on the scrolls and his public statements about them,


411
0:42:39,523 --> 0:42:45,796
he was made the target of sharp and unjustified criticism by his team mates who attacked him in the press.


412
0:42:45,796 --> 0:42:51,35
And it seemed to me in the reference in that scroll to crucifixion 


413
0:42:51,35 --> 0:42:57,808
that it brought us much closer to the Christian story, the myth of Jesus. 


414
0:42:57,808 --> 0:43:5,249
And then when I published this there was such an outburst, an uproar not least among my colleagues who were afraid – 


415
0:43:5,249 --> 0:43:11,622
fear that it would upset people that Jesus wasn’t the first prophet to be crucified or something…


416
0:43:11,622 --> 0:43:20,164
No, more than that; the links between Jesus and the leader of the Essenes, were much closer, 


417
0:43:20,164 --> 0:43:23,2
could have been much closer than had been realized.


418
0:43:23,2 --> 0:43:27,771
That the uniqueness of the Christian story was at risk. 


419
0:43:27,771 --> 0:43:37,848
They then wrote a letter to the Times and I realized then that I walked into a mind field.


420
0:43:37,848 --> 0:43:41,652
But by 1967, Allegro’s openness to other’s ideas 


421
0:43:41,652 --> 0:43:46,79
had brought him in contact with the works of Professor Ramsbottom of London’s Botanical Museum. 


422
0:43:46,79 --> 0:43:55,766
Ramsbottom is likely the proper founder of the field of ethnomycology. 


423
0:43:55,766 --> 0:43:59,169
Allegro also came across the works of R. Gordon Wasson –


424
0:43:59,169 --> 0:44:4,575
the famous amateur mycologist who is presently credited as the founder of this field of study. 


425
0:44:4,575 --> 0:44:9,446
These people had suggested that the foundations of Hinduism and early Judaism


426
0:44:9,446 --> 0:44:13,851
were based on drug cults that used the Amanita muscaria mushroom. 


427
0:44:13,851 --> 0:44:17,821
Allegro, based on his deep understanding of Biblical lore,


428
0:44:17,821 --> 0:44:21,291
the Dead Sea Scrolls, and ancient history and language 


429
0:44:21,291 --> 0:44:27,331
concluded that the foundations of Christianity could not be any different.


430
0:44:27,331 --> 0:44:37,241
I believe that the innocent collection of tales and sayings which was apparently allowed to pass freely among the beleaguered cells of believers 


431
0:44:37,241 --> 0:44:44,715
in hourly danger of discovery and execution was but a cover story. 


432
0:44:44,715 --> 0:44:50,154
From that highly improbably account of a gentle rabbi –


433
0:44:50,154 --> 0:44:57,995
friend of little children, Roman tax collectors, and ladies with gynecological problems – 


434
0:44:57,995 --> 0:45:9,873
could be distilled, by skilled interpreters well versed in the art of rabbinic exegesis as well as the abracadabra of Gnostic mysticism, 


435
0:45:9,873 --> 0:45:14,144
secret passwords and sayings. 


436
0:45:14,144 --> 0:45:20,84
The formulae for medicaments and hallucinatory drugs… 


437
0:45:20,84 --> 0:45:34,198
the therapia in practice and prescription which had earned them their reputation and name of Asayya – Essenes – physicians. 


438
0:45:34,198 --> 0:45:39,136
By 1970, Allegro published what he considered the pinnacle of his research, 


439
0:45:39,136 --> 0:45:43,307
a book he thought would launch him into history as one of the world’s great thinkers – 


440
0:45:43,307 --> 0:45:45,242
“The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross”. 


441
0:45:45,242 --> 0:45:51,915
In this book, Allegro exposes the foundation of Christianity as not only a derivative of astrotheology, 


442
0:45:51,915 --> 0:45:56,253
but he also exposes that much of the mythology paralleling Christianity 


443
0:45:56,253 --> 0:46:3,127
is firmly rooted in fertility cults and psychedelic drug use - especially that of the Amanita muscaria. 


444
0:46:3,127 --> 0:46:7,397
Throughout the rest of his life, Allegro published several books including 


445
0:46:7,397 --> 0:46:9,333
The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth, 


446
0:46:9,333 --> 0:46:12,35
that furthered his research into this area.


447
0:46:12,35 --> 0:46:20,677
However, the publication of the Sacred Mushroom and the Cross, instead of launching Allegro as a famous thinker, destroyed his career. 


448
0:46:20,677 --> 0:46:25,949
No scholar at the time would publicly debate Allegro on a point-by-point basis. 


449
0:46:25,949 --> 0:46:29,186
They instead resorted to unfounded public attacks.


450
0:46:29,186 --> 0:46:37,961
However, hindsight is 20/20 and we, amongst many other researchers think that Allegro, at least in large part, was correct. 


451
0:46:37,961 --> 0:46:46,87
And some great thinkers are not recognized for their contributions until after their lives have ended…. 


452
0:46:46,87 --> 0:46:53,377
Allegro died on his 65th birthday, February 17, 1988.


453
0:46:53,377 --> 0:46:59,583
In May of 2005, John Allegro’s daughter, Judith Anne Brown, 


454
0:46:59,583 --> 0:47:4,288
published John Marco Allegro – The Maverick of the Dead Sea Scrolls. 


455
0:47:4,288 --> 0:47:21,171
This book debunks most of the unfounded attacks against Allegro through the Allegro archives and his many missives.


456
0:47:21,171 --> 0:47:28,145
The growth cycle of this mushroom is important to understand because our ancient ancestors who made these myths 


457
0:47:28,145 --> 0:47:35,686
would watch this mushroom and see how it grew and those attributes were applied to a deity. 


458
0:47:35,686 --> 0:47:41,191
So the grow cycle is very important to understand. And just to run through this really quickly.


459
0:47:41,191 --> 0:47:49,466
The mushroom begins as a spore. These spores are too small to be seen individually by the naked eye. 


460
0:47:49,466 --> 0:47:55,806
We can see clusters of spores. But the spore is like the seed of the mushroom. 


461
0:47:55,806 --> 0:48:5,782
And the part of the mushroom that we can see is the part of the mushroom used to spread the seed. It is the phallic portion of the mushroom. 


462
0:48:5,782 --> 0:48:20,931
The actual body of the mushroom is the mycelium that is below the ground and attaching itself to the roots of the tree. So the mushroom attaches itself to the roots of the tree. And it can not live without this tree. 


463
0:48:20,931 --> 0:48:27,671
These mushrooms live in a symbiotic, a “mycorrhizal symbiotic” relationship with the tree. 


464
0:48:27,671 --> 0:48:36,546
They help the tree, they feed the tree nutrients and the tree feeds them nutrients. So they kind of live in harmony together.


465
0:48:36,546 --> 0:48:39,917
So these mushrooms are seen as the fruiting body of the tree. 


466
0:48:39,917 --> 0:48:46,857
Just as nature needs a tree to grow apples, nature also needs trees to grow these mushrooms.


467
0:48:46,857 --> 0:48:57,401
And just as an apple is something used by nature to spread a seed, so is the mushroom.


468
0:48:57,401 --> 0:49:4,107
So we see three stages of the mushrooms growth cycle here and the mushroom appears to be going thru an egg stage, 


469
0:49:4,107 --> 0:49:5,575
a lot of mushrooms do this.


470
0:49:5,575 --> 0:49:10,48
The Amanita is one of them that appears to look like an egg in this stage of growth. 


471
0:49:10,48 --> 0:49:15,953
And it’s white, and on the right here you see the red cap of the mushroom peering through.


472
0:49:15,953 --> 0:49:25,495
What it is breaking through is called the universal veil, so the universal veil tears to expose the red cap of the mushroom. 


473
0:49:25,495 --> 0:49:29,399
And it is a universal veil, it covers the entire mushroom, the universal veil covers the entire mushroom. 


474
0:49:29,399 --> 0:49:39,609
So as the veil tears, as the red mushroom cap gets bigger and bigger


475
0:49:39,609 --> 0:49:52,289
the veil peels itself across the top of the mushroom and it leaves these remnants, these veil remnants that leave white spots on the mushroom. 


476
0:49:52,289 --> 0:49:55,92
So now this is the male portion of the mushroom. 


477
0:49:55,92 --> 0:50:4,968
These stages of growth of the mushroom are considered the male phallic as you see the mushroom getting stronger and stronger.


478
0:50:4,968 --> 0:50:9,106
So the mushroom cap is completely outside the veil of the mushroom. 


479
0:50:9,106 --> 0:50:19,116
And the veil of the mushroom is now attached itself to the rim of the cap of the mushroom, and it is concealing the gills of the mushroom 


480
0:50:19,116 --> 0:50:33,897
and as the mushroom cap expands further and further and further this universal veil cannot stretch any further and it begins to tear, and this is seen as the circumcision of the mushroom.


481
0:50:33,897 --> 0:50:40,3
As the mushroom expands further, the universal veil separates itself completely from the underside of the cap, 


482
0:50:40,3 --> 0:50:47,377
falls, and hangs on the stalk or stipe of the mushroom like a skirt.


483
0:50:47,377 --> 0:50:52,449
The Amanita will continue to grow upward, flattening itself into a small table.


484
0:50:52,449 --> 0:50:59,423
One may wish to keep in mind that the Knights of the Round Table were (or are, if these Knights evolved into the Knights Templars) 


485
0:50:59,423 --> 0:51:3,126
the keepers and protectors of the Holy Grail. 


486
0:51:3,126 --> 0:51:11,935
This is important to remember because the next stage in the growth cycle of this mushroom is the cup or grail stage.


487
0:51:11,935 --> 0:51:18,108
The mushroom cap continues to upturn and the cap becomes somewhat of a cup or chalice 


488
0:51:18,108 --> 0:51:25,449
and will often hold the morning dew or rain.


489
0:51:25,449 --> 0:51:29,319
When the morning dew collects in the cup of the upturned mushroom cap, 


490
0:51:29,319 --> 0:51:34,191
some of the psychedelic substances are drawn out of the mushroom and into the water. 


491
0:51:34,191 --> 0:51:38,95
Consequently, the water is colored red, like blood. 


492
0:51:38,95 --> 0:51:44,835
Some of this bright red pigment from the mushroom’s cap “bleeds into” the water. 


493
0:51:44,835 --> 0:51:51,808
This, among other things, will fade the mushroom from a bright red into an orange-like or golden color.


494
0:51:51,808 --> 0:51:58,515
Although the psychedelic effects would not be nearly as intense as a belly-full of mushrooms, 


495
0:51:58,515 --> 0:52:14,464
one could literally take this golden colored chalice-shaped mushroom and drink the blood of “Jesus” from the Holy Grail.


496
0:52:14,464 --> 0:52:19,736
Not only is this mushroom the literal Holy Grail, it is also the mythological phoenix. 


497
0:52:19,736 --> 0:52:24,608
The Phoenix is born from its ashes, but it will never live to leave its nest. 


498
0:52:24,608 --> 0:52:35,919
For as it lifts its wings in attempt to fly, it bursts into flames and it engulfs itself, leaving nothing behind but its own ashes and the cycle continues.


499
0:52:35,919 --> 0:52:42,726
Here are the eggs in the nest…the colorful, red eggs of the phoenix


500
0:52:42,726 --> 0:52:45,829
The Amanita resembles a red bird with wings, 


501
0:52:45,829 --> 0:52:49,966
As the Phoenix lifts its wings in attempt to fly


502
0:52:49,966 --> 0:52:52,602
it bursts into flames and it engulfs itself


503
0:52:52,602 --> 0:52:57,107
as the fungus quickly decomposes, it leaves nothing behind


504
0:52:57,107 --> 0:53:0,71
…but its own ashes…the millions of mushroom spores, 


505
0:53:0,71 --> 0:53:8,485
and the hair-like mycelia attached to the roots of the tree that grow underground. 


506
0:53:8,485 --> 0:53:12,989
and as the cycle continues as mushroom spores serve as the seed of the mushroom, 


507
0:53:12,989 --> 0:53:20,13
seemingly planting itself in the same location over and 
over.


508
0:53:20,13 --> 0:53:24,434
And these stories were created to pass this type of knowledge down. 


509
0:53:24,434 --> 0:53:28,705
Easter is a great example of this. The Easter egg hunt is the mushroom hunt. 


510
0:53:28,705 --> 0:53:32,909
We find the correct mushroom. It’s a way of identifying the mushroom –


511
0:53:32,909 --> 0:53:35,478
find us the correct mushroom and we’ll get you a treat. 


512
0:53:35,478 --> 0:53:42,452
And who better to go hunting these mushrooms - these colorful little egg 


513
0:53:42,452 --> 0:53:44,788
like mushrooms or the big holy grail type mushrooms – 


514
0:53:44,788 --> 0:53:50,26
who better to go find these mushrooms than little kids who can crawl up under these trees.


515
0:53:50,26 --> 0:53:55,65
Rather than some big clumsy adult.


516
0:53:55,65 --> 0:53:58,368
These mushrooms have a symbiotic relationship with these trees. 


517
0:53:58,368 --> 0:54:4,608
Conifer trees, they love conifer trees. Pine trees. They flourish under pine trees.


518
0:54:4,608 --> 0:54:10,13
And this mushroom is the hidden mushroom, hidden eggs,  


519
0:54:10,13 --> 0:54:18,154
you can see here this bright red mushroom, it’s obvious on the screen, but just below it is one that’s hidden.


520
0:54:18,154 --> 0:54:23,26
You have to have a good eye.


521
0:54:23,26 --> 0:54:35,772
Depending on the season and depending on the area, these mushrooms can be gold as well


522
0:54:35,772 --> 0:54:44,447
We see these mushrooms reflected in our Easter cards as well.  


523
0:54:44,447 --> 0:54:58,61
Kind Easter wishes as the gnome is leaning upon the mushroom with his sacred text or his recipe book open. 


524
0:54:58,61 --> 0:55:9,205
So we pass this knowledge down to our children. We initiate the children. 


525
0:55:9,205 --> 0:55:12,275
So like Santa Clause who dresses in red and white, 


526
0:55:12,275 --> 0:55:24,287
the shaman will dress in the colors of their sacred plants. And the Amanita using shaman dress in the red and white colors of the Amanita muscaria 


527
0:55:24,287 --> 0:55:30,894
And here we see the Pope dressing in something that looks quite a bit like the Amanita mushroom 


528
0:55:30,894 --> 0:55:35,165
and the snow adds a little extra effect putting the white dots on the red cap. 


529
0:55:35,165 --> 0:55:55,819
Popes and Cardinals all throughout history have dressed just like this Amanita muscaria mushroom.


530
0:55:55,819 --> 0:56:3,59
This figure identifies the Virgin Mary in the Dormition icon as  Amanita-form.


531
0:56:3,59 --> 0:56:14,637
Notice the red cap, the skirt-like wrap over the shoulders, and the hash marks at the bottom.


532
0:56:14,637 --> 0:56:17,24
As we mentioned earlier, Medieval Cathedrals


533
0:56:17,24 --> 0:56:23,613
that were primarily used for religious study, were often called mystery schools.


534
0:56:23,613 --> 0:56:30,553
And here you can see a sunburst made out of stained glass... 


535
0:56:30,553 --> 0:56:36,493
above the mushroom-shaped doorway, all of it based in sacred geometry.


536
0:56:36,493 --> 0:56:43,133
The Eleusinian mysteries were undoubtedly the most famous of the secret religious rites of ancient Greece. 


537
0:56:43,133 --> 0:56:46,269
And here is Persephone and Demeter and what are they doing?


538
0:56:46,269 --> 0:56:54,244
The most important part of the Eleusinian mysteries was the ingestion of the Kykeon or K-I-keon.


539
0:56:54,244 --> 0:56:57,18
And what could that have been? It was an initiation.


540
0:56:57,18 --> 0:57:2,419
The Road to Eleusis argues strongly that Demeter’s potion, the Kykeon, 


541
0:57:2,419 --> 0:57:7,157
was entheogenic – most likely ergot.


542
0:57:7,157 --> 0:57:11,461
And more recently, Professor Carl Ruck of Boston University argues 


543
0:57:11,461 --> 0:57:14,464
in Sacred Mushrooms: Secrets of Eleusis, 


544
0:57:14,464 --> 0:57:18,768
that Kykeon was a mushroom.


545
0:57:18,768 --> 0:57:21,438
We’d like to discuss Santa Claus again for a moment… 


546
0:57:21,438 --> 0:57:28,978
this mysterious old man, somehow got him self intertwined into the Christian celebrations of the Birth of their deity. 


547
0:57:28,978 --> 0:57:31,414
In the middle ages, Santa was a Shaman, 


548
0:57:31,414 --> 0:57:41,191
and you can easily trace many similarities between the Shamans of the past into our Christmas traditions of today.


549
0:57:41,191 --> 0:57:47,497
A “Shaman” is, in many ways, similar to what we more commonly refer to in America as a “medicine man”. 


550
0:57:47,497 --> 0:57:51,468
In Siberia, the local Shaman was the oracle of the community, 


551
0:57:51,468 --> 0:58:0,977
nothing of importance happened in the community without the okay from the Shaman.


552
0:58:0,977 --> 0:58:3,813
The Shaman would also hold very strong plant knowledge. 


553
0:58:3,813 --> 0:58:7,283
This knowledge included plants for medicine and healing, poisons 


554
0:58:7,283 --> 0:58:19,863
and warfare, and powerful hallucinogenic plants used in their religious ceremonies. 


555
0:58:19,863 --> 0:58:23,166
You can often find chimney sweeps on old holiday post cards, 


556
0:58:23,166 --> 0:58:27,403
holding the Amanita muscaria mushroom. 


557
0:58:27,403 --> 0:58:37,68
This is but a subtle hint to the connection of someone with the Amanita mushroom, and a Chimney.


558
0:58:37,68 --> 0:58:41,918
The ancient Shamans of Siberia would go to the houses, huts, or Yurts 


559
0:58:41,918 --> 0:58:45,221
of the people in the community in celebration of the winter solstice 


560
0:58:45,221 --> 0:58:55,899
and bring to them these pre-dried mushrooms and often guide them thru the experience…it was their yearly tradition. 


561
0:58:55,899 --> 0:59:0,87
If the main door to the Yurt was snowed over -which they often were during the wintertime, 


562
0:59:0,87 --> 0:59:5,141
it is said that the Shaman would enter symbolically through the secondary entrance. 


563
0:59:5,141 --> 0:59:12,48
This just so happens to be the smoke-hole in the roof – or the chimney.


564
0:59:12,48 --> 0:59:15,985
The Shaman; dressing in red and white, and carrying a huge bag


565
0:59:15,985 --> 0:59:20,189
full of Amanita muscaria mushrooms that he had picked and dried during the previous season – 


566
0:59:20,189 --> 0:59:23,826
enough for the entire community - would go door to door … 


567
0:59:23,826 --> 0:59:31,501
bartering and selling his dried mushrooms.


568
0:59:31,501 --> 0:59:34,604
And how would the shaman travel? He used a sleigh, 


569
0:59:34,604 --> 0:59:37,64
and the animals pulling his sleigh were not dogs or horses. 


570
0:59:37,64 --> 0:59:46,249
The Siberian shaman used caribou, also known as reindeer, as they were indigenous to Siberia.  


571
0:59:46,249 --> 0:59:52,655
Amanita muscaria mushrooms go through a chemical process called decarboxilation as they dry.  


572
0:59:52,655 --> 0:59:58,528
We’ll talk more about this chemical process in a minute, but they also go through a physical process when they dry…


573
0:59:58,528 --> 0:59:59,862
they get lighter. 


574
0:59:59,862 --> 1:0:4,367
They retain much of their potency when they are dried, and in fact, chemically speaking they get stronger, 


575
1:0:4,367 --> 1:0:13,42
and this allows the shaman to consume more than if the mushrooms were wet and heavy.


576
1:0:13,42 --> 1:0:15,979
Even to this day, it is a common practice for people to stack their mushrooms in socks 


577
1:0:15,979 --> 1:0:24,721
and hang them over the fireplace overnight to dry them out.


578
1:0:24,721 --> 1:0:30,126
But imagine that you’re out in a pine forest hunting mushrooms for the entire community. 


579
1:0:30,126 --> 1:0:39,936
These mushrooms can grow to be quite large, and the sack that you use to carry the mushrooms in would get quite heavy. 


580
1:0:39,936 --> 1:0:43,94
But knowing that these mushrooms should to be dried before ceremonial ingestion, 


581
1:0:43,94 --> 1:0:47,176
it would be wise to dry them out before carrying them home. 


582
1:0:47,176 --> 1:0:55,685
This would allow you to carry more and it would keep the mushrooms on the bottom of the sack from being crushed by the weight of the others.


583
1:0:55,685 --> 1:1:2,458
One good way to dry mushrooms as you continue to hunt for more is to select a tree in a central location,


584
1:1:2,458 --> 1:1:12,402
and use its boughs as a basket to hold your freshly picked mushrooms, drying them in the sun as you search for more.


585
1:1:12,402 --> 1:1:18,641
This would look a lot like a decorated Christmas tree. 


586
1:1:18,641 --> 1:1:47,77
And as we mentioned, the Red and White mushroom Christmas ornaments are some of the oldest ornaments you can find.


587
1:1:47,77 --> 1:2:0,283
The oldest of all Christmas tree decorations were edible. 


588
1:2:0,283 --> 1:2:7,323
When the Church adopted the Christmas tree, making it okay for Christians to have one and often placing one in the church as well, 


589
1:2:7,323 --> 1:2:11,928
the ornaments on the tree were the Eucharist – the body of Christ. 


590
1:2:11,928 --> 1:2:17,567
The mushrooms are, as John Allegro pointed out, literally the flesh of God, 


591
1:2:17,567 --> 1:2:33,349
and symbolically placing the Eucharist on the Christmas tree is a direct representation of placing the Mushrooms on the Christmas tree.


592
1:2:33,349 --> 1:2:37,687
I’d like to change gears for just a moment and discuss the Fountains of Living Waters, 


593
1:2:37,687 --> 1:2:43,993
also known as the fountain of youth.  


594
1:2:43,993 --> 1:2:49,232
This ties back to the death and the rebirth experience where the shaman will train for death 


595
1:2:49,232 --> 1:2:53,102
with the same determination as a boxer would train for a fight.


596
1:2:53,102 --> 1:2:57,54
After all, one cannot conquer death without training for such an event.


597
1:2:57,54 --> 1:3:1,878
…in the day that thou eatest therof thou shalt surely die.


598
1:3:1,878 --> 1:3:4,914
We mentioned that the mushroom should be dried before consumption. 


599
1:3:4,914 --> 1:3:9,51
But drying the mushroom is only half of this ceremonial process. 


600
1:3:9,51 --> 1:3:13,689
Drying the mushroom will indeed allow one to consume more of the active ingredients, 


601
1:3:13,689 --> 1:3:17,493
but in order to evoke the shamanic death and rebirth experience; 


602
1:3:17,493 --> 1:3:22,398
the shamans also often consume their urine after ingesting the mushroom. 


603
1:3:22,398 --> 1:3:27,837
This is done because the urine is now infused with the psychedelic Ibotenic acid and Muscimol…


604
1:3:27,837 --> 1:3:35,244
and anyone who consumes this laced urine will have a psychedelic experience.


605
1:3:35,244 --> 1:3:40,516
The very thought of drinking your own urine is indeed a turn off, especially in our society today. 


606
1:3:40,516 --> 1:3:47,99
But for the shaman growing up around these things, this was a common practice. 
609 
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,957 
Urine can actually be good for you, 


607
1:3:47,99 --> 1:3:58,501
I’m not going to go into those details here, but the results of an internet search for Urine Therapy might surprise you.


608
1:3:58,501 --> 1:4:3,439
Here is the homunculus or Little Man again, urinating into the water fountain.


609
1:4:3,439 --> 1:4:8,945
Fountains do not use fresh water; consequently, he is recycling his water


610
1:4:8,945 --> 1:4:17,82
and this is a huge key for those who are seeking the Holy Grail.


611
1:4:17,82 --> 1:4:23,926
This is a description of one of the greatest mystical symbols in alchemy: the Ouroboros. 


612
1:4:23,926 --> 1:4:27,697
It is a symbol of the eternal life. 


613
1:4:27,697 --> 1:4:33,436
The Ouroboros is symbolized by a snake biting its own tail, 


614
1:4:33,436 --> 1:4:39,742
and often it is represented as a winged dragon above a serpent, both biting one another’s tail. 


615
1:4:39,742 --> 1:4:45,81
Staying true to the mystical theme with the wings above and the serpent below.


616
1:4:45,81 --> 1:4:48,718
The symbol for the Ouroboros can also be found in Christianity. 


617
1:4:48,718 --> 1:4:55,825
What is interesting in this image is not that the All-Seeing Eye is representing God or that the Holy Spirit is the bird, 


618
1:4:55,825 --> 1:5:4,667
but that Jesus is represented by a snake, the Ouroboros…more on that in just a moment.


619
1:5:4,667 --> 1:5:14,21
The Bible quotes Jesus as saying – “If any man thirsts, let him come unto me, and drink…out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.”


620
1:5:14,21 --> 1:5:16,846
And the Bible tells us that we are supposed to –


621
1:5:16,846 --> 1:5:23,452
“Drink water from our own cistern, running water from our own well.” 


622
1:5:23,452 --> 1:5:29,358
This is all apart of the recipe; all apart of understanding these ancient shamanic techniques 


623
1:5:29,358 --> 1:5:37,233
when they consumed this Amanita mushroom in their rituals.


624
1:5:37,233 --> 1:5:46,275
This leads us directly into the twin fountains and the two waters.


625
1:5:46,275 --> 1:5:50,646
In the book of John, the story of the woman at the well, the woman says to Jesus, 


626
1:5:50,646 --> 1:5:56,619
‘Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?


627
1:5:56,619 --> 1:6:1,824
Jesus said to her: “Whoever drinks this water will be thirsty again. 


628
1:6:1,824 --> 1:6:5,661
Whoever drinks the water that I will give him will never be thirty. 


629
1:6:5,661 --> 1:6:18,274
The water that I give him will become in him a well of life that last forever.”


630
1:6:18,274 --> 1:6:27,583
Two different kinds of water 


631
1:6:27,583 --> 1:6:29,952
Here is the alchemical depiction of Mt-Helicon


632
1:6:29,952 --> 1:6:33,222
-and-twin-fountains atop a mushroom shaped hill 


633
1:6:33,222 --> 1:6:43,399
this displays the Tree of Life next to the phallic shaped fountain with twin spouts.


634
1:6:43,399 --> 1:6:59,415
And on either side of the phallic obelisk at the Vatican are twin fountains. 


635
1:6:59,415 --> 1:7:8,57
Both resemble the Amanita mushroom in both the canopy stage and the Holy Grail stage of growth.


636
1:7:8,57 --> 1:7:17,99
Hidden in plain sight in the Vatican courtyard, the Holy Grail has become all but invisible.


637
1:7:17,99 --> 1:7:22,204
The Twin Fountains throughout Alchemy and Mysticism represent two different types of water.


638
1:7:22,204 --> 1:7:25,808
More precisely, they represent two different types of urine.


639
1:7:25,808 --> 1:7:33,382
This gives a whole new meaning to the terms “Water into Wine” and “Take and Drink”.


640
1:7:33,382 --> 1:7:38,87
Clark Heinrich points out this image of “Titian’s Bacchanal of the Andrians”


641
1:7:38,87 --> 1:7:46,28
here is the Homunculus again, urinating into the river of wine.


642
1:7:46,28 --> 1:7:51,867
This man is scooping it up into a pitcher,


643
1:7:51,867 --> 1:7:58,14
and passing it around as everyone is drinking it.


644
1:7:58,14 --> 1:8:2,711
There is a line from a French songbook in the foreground that reads, 


645
1:8:2,711 --> 1:8:11,921
“He who drinks and does not drink again, does not know what drinking is” 


646
1:8:11,921 --> 1:8:16,559
This symbol is called the Caduceus and it is the serpent-entwined staff


647
1:8:16,559 --> 1:8:21,931
that is used as a symbol for healing and for drugs today.  


648
1:8:21,931 --> 1:8:34,41
After the Exodus from Egypt, Moses placed a serpent on a staff and used it to heal his people.


649
1:8:34,41 --> 1:8:40,49
The serpent-entwined staffs are the symbol of Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine. 


650
1:8:40,49 --> 1:8:51,994
And his association with medicine is his association with the serpent.


651
1:8:51,994 --> 1:9:7,42
Here is the serpent entwined staff with the wings at the top in a caduceus-like totem in Tiananmen Square.


652
1:9:7,42 --> 1:9:12,348
The person holding the Mace in the US Capitol has 'absolute authority' to speak, 


653
1:9:12,348 --> 1:9:18,287
as the Mace is a scepter of authority. Notice its design…


654
1:9:18,287 --> 1:9:19,722
Symbolically speaking, 


655
1:9:19,722 --> 1:9:25,961
the Egyptian winged sun disk is a stylized variation of the Caduceus. 


656
1:9:25,961 --> 1:9:37,406
The wings are there, the serpents are there, and the disk represents the crown of the staff of the Caduceus.


657
1:9:37,406 --> 1:9:40,843
And what do we do to our Christmas tree? 


658
1:9:40,843 --> 1:9:45,347
We place red and white gifts below it representing the entheogens, 


659
1:9:45,347 --> 1:9:50,19
we entwine it with ribbon representing the Kundalini energy rising up the body,


660
1:9:50,19 --> 1:9:57,26
and we place wings at the top - completing the symbol of the caduceus. 


661
1:9:57,26 --> 1:10:11,707
The very tree, under which these mushrooms grow in nature, becomes the symbol for the drugs themselves - the caduceus.


662
1:10:11,707 --> 1:10:17,79
Now we can return to the deity portrayed in this stance and get an entirely new perspective. 


663
1:10:17,79 --> 1:10:22,451
It should be totally clear why this posture or the stance is so important; 


664
1:10:22,451 --> 1:10:28,357
we see Krishna doing it, the goddess doing it, the caduceus, all standing with this posture 


665
1:10:28,357 --> 1:10:31,327
all standing like the Amanita mushroom. 


666
1:10:31,327 --> 1:10:43,38
As the deity is wearing only draping around his waist, and thorns on his head. 


667
1:10:43,38 --> 1:10:47,142
Getting high (or The Most High, as we call God) 


668
1:10:47,142 --> 1:10:50,779
is about climbing the cosmic ladder to godhead


669
1:10:50,779 --> 1:11:12,234
and ladders predominate in alchemy and mysticism.


670
1:11:12,234 --> 1:11:26,48
Jacob rests his head on some sort of a stone and has dreams of a ladder to heaven.


671
1:11:26,48 --> 1:11:31,52
In Christianity…


672
1:11:31,52 --> 1:11:36,792
In Freemasonry…


673
1:11:36,792 --> 1:11:41,263
Even in the tale of Jack and the Beanstalk, Jack climbs a vine to heavens,


674
1:11:41,263 --> 1:11:46,68
or the cosmic spinal ladder to godhead…and what does he find there?


675
1:11:46,68 --> 1:11:51,373
The golden eggs…


676
1:11:51,373 --> 1:11:56,945
The golden eggs of alchemy - 


677
1:11:56,945 --> 1:12:1,35
the Amanita muscaria mushroom.


678
1:12:1,35 --> 1:12:6,455
Real gold is only a materialistic item that will get you nowhere in the afterlife.


679
1:12:6,455 --> 1:12:13,929
But this shamanic out of body experience is preparation for actual death. 


680
1:12:13,929 --> 1:12:24,73
It’s training for that cross over period from this reality into what ever is our next reality.


681
1:12:24,73 --> 1:12:28,711
Here is Mithra standing on top of the cosmic egg, or the primordial mound. 


682
1:12:28,711 --> 1:12:35,5
He has the entwined serpent around his body, making the caduceus and symbolizing drugs. 


683
1:12:35,5 --> 1:12:38,62
Mithra is the drug itself, the mushroom.


684
1:12:38,62 --> 1:12:43,659
The Amanita muscaria is also born from a primordial mound. 


685
1:12:43,659 --> 1:12:48,33
Mithra has tail-feathers like those that the mushroom does (the annulus), 


686
1:12:48,33 --> 1:12:54,37
and he also has wings atop on his shoulders representing the upturned gills of the mushroom.


687
1:12:54,37 --> 1:12:59,241
Continuing with the symbolism of the mushroom, we find the divine hermaphrodite. 


688
1:12:59,241 --> 1:13:2,745
Polar opposites combined into one entity.


689
1:13:2,745 --> 1:13:7,983
Usually male and female, with wings upon its back…


690
1:13:7,983 --> 1:13:18,56
It is this personified dualistic deity that leads us into the Rebis – or the Re-Re…two things.


691
1:13:18,56 --> 1:13:26,535
Often times the Rebis will be seen with a cup in one hand and a serpent or an ouroboros in the other. 


692
1:13:26,535 --> 1:13:31,73
It is standing upon Mercury and Venus with serpents in the cup


693
1:13:31,73 --> 1:13:37,146
representing the poison or the drugs contained in the cup - the medicine.


694
1:13:37,146 --> 1:13:43,585
The Amanita muscaria mushroom is seen as both the male and female sex organs of its personified deity. 


695
1:13:43,585 --> 1:13:52,94
Here you can see the stalk of the mushroom penetrating the cap in an act of divine coitus.


696
1:13:52,94 --> 1:13:55,464
The male and female portions of the mushroom consist of a breast


697
1:13:55,464 --> 1:13:58,4
and yoni for the female, and


698
1:13:58,4 --> 1:14:1,27
a single testicle and penis for the male. 


699
1:14:1,27 --> 1:14:6,542
By splitting the mushroom open in its earlier growth stages, the act of sex is blatant…


700
1:14:6,542 --> 1:14:12,47
all that is missing are the bodies of the god and goddess.


701
1:14:12,47 --> 1:14:14,917
In the Hindu myth, Shiva is a hermaphrodite. 


702
1:14:14,917 --> 1:14:21,657
Like the mushroom, Shiva has a penis, one testicle and a breast.


703
1:14:21,657 --> 1:14:30,899
In the book of Genesis, Eve was created from the rib of Adam. Actually, at this point, Adam is a hermaphrodite…


704
1:14:30,899 --> 1:14:44,78
Genesis 5:2, “Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.”


705
1:14:44,78 --> 1:14:53,589
Adam, being the male, represents the mushroom in its earlier, phallic-like growth stages…


706
1:14:53,589 --> 1:14:58,93
…while Eve, the female, is the womb-like opening of the gills. 


707
1:14:58,93 --> 1:15:5,868
The reverse side, the single breast of the cap, is literally the eave of the mushroom. 


708
1:15:5,868 --> 1:15:14,576
When the Amanita’s cap separates to form the eave (or the canopy), it figuratively pulls a rib out of the stalk or stipe of the mushroom.


709
1:15:14,576 --> 1:15:22,651
The mushroom’s universal veil tears away from the ribs and drops down forming a skirt or apron; the eve of the mushroom appears to be 


710
1:15:22,651 --> 1:15:32,961
‘born’ from the rib or from the side of the male portion of the mushroom.


711
1:15:32,961 --> 1:15:36,798
Because this is the portion of the mushroom that is most often consumed, 


712
1:15:36,798 --> 1:15:40,402
this is also the portion of the mushroom that provides enlightenment. 


713
1:15:40,402 --> 1:15:49,545
The female provides enlightenment and the female comes from the rib of the male.


714
1:15:49,545 --> 1:15:53,882
But there is another story in the bible of enlightenment coming from the side of man. 


715
1:15:53,882 --> 1:15:56,385
Not only is Eve born of the rib of Adam, but 


716
1:15:56,385 --> 1:16:3,625
Jesus, hanging on the cross, is lanced in the rib and out of his side comes the blood that is collected into the Holy Grail; 


717
1:16:3,625 --> 1:16:13,135
so out of the rib comes the enlightenment once again.


718
1:16:13,135 --> 1:16:19,775
The Canterbury Psalter from 1147 CE has twelve segments representing the twelve signs of the zodiac. 


719
1:16:19,775 --> 1:16:25,113
Inside each segment is a representation from the different parts of the creation of the world epic


720
1:16:25,113 --> 1:16:27,249
as described in the book of Genesis. 


721
1:16:27,249 --> 1:16:36,625
In the top right segment, we see Jesus or God as the Lord of magical plants.


722
1:16:36,625 --> 1:16:44,32
The red mushroom on the right is clearly the Amanita muscaria. The  Amanita is said to produce the quickening of the spirit. 


723
1:16:44,32 --> 1:16:54,376
The next one is obviously another mushroom, but it is blue. This indicates Psilocybe mushrooms which are said to open the third eye.


724
1:16:54,376 --> 1:17:2,451
Next may be a depiction of a Syrian Rue pod, shaped as a mushroom, which happens to match this in color as well as a similar structure. 


725
1:17:2,451 --> 1:17:7,723
Syrian rue, or Paganum Harmala, is known increase the effects of the other compounds, 


726
1:17:7,723 --> 1:17:11,126
and also posses other known qualities. 


727
1:17:11,126 --> 1:17:15,263
On the left is a depiction of an Opium Poppy, also shaped as a mushroom. 


728
1:17:15,263 --> 1:17:22,704
And due to the euphoria it induces, it helps one to relax enough to let go in order fully experience the visionary state. 


729
1:17:22,704 --> 1:17:28,377
It helps one withstand the intense experience without the constant urge to “make it stop” – 


730
1:17:28,377 --> 1:17:38,654
which, by the way, is not an option.


731
1:17:38,654 --> 1:17:42,9
Another panel depicts the scene in the Garden of Eden with the serpent. 


732
1:17:42,9 --> 1:17:47,362
Notice that the serpent has entwined the staff which is actually the stem of a mushroom. 


733
1:17:47,362 --> 1:17:59,408
It looks a bit like the Amanita muscaria, although it does appear to depict some type of Psilocybe mushroom or other types of mushrooms as well. 


734
1:17:59,408 --> 1:18:13,488
At the very top of the center “tree,” or serpent-entwined mushroom, may be seen little mushrooms inside the cap.


735
1:18:13,488 --> 1:18:18,36
This is an alchemical depiction by Nicholas Flamel of a woman clothed in the sun. 


736
1:18:18,36 --> 1:18:21,73
She has a crown of stars on her head, and she is pregnant.


737
1:18:21,73 --> 1:18:30,272
She has the wings of eagles on her back and she is standing upon a crescent moon. 


738
1:18:30,272 --> 1:18:35,777
To her right is a leviathan-like serpent with seven heads


739
1:18:35,777 --> 1:18:43,218
and it is sweeping stars out of the sky with its tail.


740
1:18:43,218 --> 1:18:50,358
On the left is an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, she is the Mexican equivalent of the Catholic Virgin. 


741
1:18:50,358 --> 1:18:55,697
Notice that she too is clothed with the sun, the crescent moon is below her. 


742
1:18:55,697 --> 1:19:0,135
Below that is a leviathan-like serpent with seven heads. 


743
1:19:0,135 --> 1:19:9,144
The stars that the leviathan was sweeping out of the sky in the Alchemical image are now hidden in the clothing of the goddess. 


744
1:19:9,144 --> 1:19:19,354
And we have shown where some of this symbolism comes from in the heavens, but let’s take a deeper look at this icon - Our Lady of Guadalupe. 


745
1:19:19,354 --> 1:19:25,193
The story of The Woman and the Dragon is found in the book of Revelation 12, where it reads - 


746
1:19:25,193 --> 1:19:28,93
A great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: 


747
1:19:28,93 --> 1:19:36,505
a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. 


748
1:19:36,505 --> 1:19:40,509
She was pregnant and she cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. 


749
1:19:40,509 --> 1:19:44,12
Then another sign appeared in heaven: 


750
1:19:44,12 --> 1:19:49,684
an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads.


751
1:19:49,684 --> 1:19:55,924
His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. 


752
1:19:55,924 --> 1:20:3,532
The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child the moment it was born. 


753
1:20:3,532 --> 1:20:11,84
She gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.


754
1:20:11,84 --> 1:20:18,847
So this is the Cosmic Christ – the First Man, Adam Kadman.


755
1:20:18,847 --> 1:20:22,851
Who else would get snatched up to god and to his throne, but the Son of God? 


756
1:20:22,851 --> 1:20:31,893
After all, if God gave his only begotten son, he must have had an only begotten son to give. 


757
1:20:31,893 --> 1:20:37,32
And this is the birth of this mythological deity. 


758
1:20:37,32 --> 1:20:43,972
In the Nag Hammadi text - which is older than the bible, and the origin of many of the stories in the Bible itself 


759
1:20:43,972 --> 1:20:50,345
you can find a very interesting story “On the Origin of the World”. 


760
1:20:50,345 --> 1:20:58,587
Sophia sent her daughter Zoe, being called Eve, as an instructor, in order that she might make Adam, 


761
1:20:58,587 --> 1:21:6,461
When Eve saw her male counterpart cast down, she had pity upon him, and said, "Adam! Become alive! Arise upon the earth!"


762
1:21:6,461 --> 1:21:11,633
And then what happened?  Immediately her word became accomplished fact. 


763
1:21:11,633 --> 1:21:22,777
For Adam, having arisen, suddenly opened his eyes. When he saw her, he said, 


764
1:21:22,777 --> 1:21:22,844
"You shall be called 'Mother of the Living'. For it is you who have given me life."  


765
1:21:22,844 --> 1:21:30,352
Then the authorities were informed that their modeled form was alive and had arisen, and they were greatly troubled.


766
1:21:30,352 --> 1:21:34,656
They sent seven archangels to see what had happened. 


767
1:21:34,656 --> 1:21:40,362
They came to Adam. When they saw Eve talking to him, they said to one another, 


768
1:21:40,362 --> 1:21:50,372
"What sort of thing is this luminous woman? For she resembles that likeness which appeared to us in the light.


769
1:21:50,372 --> 1:21:51,873
So what did they do to her? 


770
1:21:51,873 --> 1:22:0,882
Now come, let us lay hold of her and cast our seed into her, so that when she becomes soiled she may not be able to ascend into her light. 


771
1:22:0,882 --> 1:22:5,353
Rather, those that she bears will be under our charge.


772
1:22:5,353 --> 1:22:9,124
But let us not tell Adam, for he is not one of us.


773
1:22:9,124 --> 1:22:12,761
Rather, let us bring a deep sleep over him. 


774
1:22:12,761 --> 1:22:26,641
And let us instruct him in his sleep to the effect that she came from his rib, in order that his wife may obey, and he may be lord over her."


775
1:22:26,641 --> 1:22:34,49
So the gods or Authorities, or land-lords here are forcing a patriarchal setting. 


776
1:22:34,49 --> 1:22:37,752
I call them LandLords, but there are also the “seven of them” 


777
1:22:37,752 --> 1:22:44,96
in the older texts, these seven authorities tell Adam and Eve not to eat from the tree of Knowledge.


778
1:22:44,96 --> 1:22:47,929
In the newer version - the Bible - 


779
1:22:47,929 --> 1:22:53,234
these seven land lords simply become the LORD in all capital letters. 


780
1:22:53,234 --> 1:23:1,776
They are by no means God or the Great Architect of the Universe. 


781
1:23:1,776 --> 1:23:18,226
They represent a governing body, and in this story they represent the governing body of the Garden of Eden.


782
1:23:18,226 --> 1:23:25,333
So this fruit from the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil…did it contain poison? 


783
1:23:25,333 --> 1:23:28,436
Is that what God was warning them about? 


784
1:23:28,436 --> 1:23:38,947
Eat this and you will die resembles something that is poisonous but the serpent assured Eve that she would not die… 


785
1:23:38,947 --> 1:23:46,121
"For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil." 


786
1:23:46,121 --> 1:23:51,326
When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, 


787
1:23:51,326 --> 1:23:56,431
and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. 


788
1:23:56,431 --> 1:23:59,968
She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. 


789
1:23:59,968 --> 1:24:5,54
Then the eyes of both of them were opened...


790
1:24:5,54 --> 1:24:7,175
And the LORD God said, 


791
1:24:7,175 --> 1:24:10,779
"The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. 


792
1:24:10,779 --> 1:24:17,819
He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the Tree of Life and eat, and live forever."


793
1:24:17,819 --> 1:24:23,324
So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden.


794
1:24:23,324 --> 1:24:27,362
God punished them for knowing good from evil, 


795
1:24:27,362 --> 1:24:31,66
but they did not die in the day of eating this forbidden fruit..


796
1:24:31,66 --> 1:24:34,469
As a matter of fact, both of them lived to be hundreds of years old. 


797
1:24:34,469 --> 1:24:46,214
So according to the Bible, what the serpent told Eve was the truth, and God was lying


798
1:24:46,214 --> 1:24:47,916
Why does God lie to them?


799
1:24:47,916 --> 1:24:55,957
Having the knowledge of good and evil seems like a strange thing to condemn someone for. 


800
1:24:55,957 --> 1:25:3,832
People are often incarcerated today because of crimes they committed resulting from their lack of knowledge of good and evil.


801
1:25:3,832 --> 1:25:7,869
Unless these Gods wanted to tell us what was right and wrong, 


802
1:25:7,869 --> 1:25:11,906
rather than have us know the difference.


803
1:25:11,906 --> 1:25:20,648
To Gnostic, Jesus was the wise serpent who gave knowledge unto man. 


804
1:25:20,648 --> 1:25:28,223
This Lucifer-like serpent was the good one who gave us the knowledge that separates us from other animals.


805
1:25:28,223 --> 1:25:33,728
Jesus and Lucifer are likened to the two serpents on the staff of Caduceus.


806
1:25:33,728 --> 1:25:37,98
They’re bound together so tightly they are inseparable.


807
1:25:37,98 --> 1:25:42,303
These two forces are the macrocosm and microcosm forces in this mythology. 


808
1:25:42,303 --> 1:25:52,113
One of them, Lucifer, has been cast down out of the heavens onto the earth; and the other, Jesus, is the risen savior.


809
1:25:52,113 --> 1:25:56,451
Making the forbidden fruit an apple is obviously symbolic. 


810
1:25:56,451 --> 1:26:2,123
The apple was chosen because it is a perfect fit for the actual forbidden fruit. 


811
1:26:2,123 --> 1:26:5,96
Apples are red and they are the fruiting body of a tree. 


812
1:26:5,96 --> 1:26:16,7
The Amanita muscaria is also red and it, too, is the fruiting body of a tree.


813
1:26:16,7 --> 1:26:23,44
When you take a bite out of the apple, you see the same white inside  


814
1:26:23,44 --> 1:26:30,518
that you would see if you find an Amanita muscaria mushroom in the wild with a bite taken out of it by a deer or another animal. 


815
1:26:30,518 --> 1:26:33,321
It is a safe, alchemical representation 


816
1:26:33,321 --> 1:26:48,97
of the actual fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil without giving away any actual knowledge of the fruit itself.


817
1:26:48,97 --> 1:26:53,41
We know that apple trees are not found among the trees of the forest. 


818
1:26:53,41 --> 1:26:59,681
However, this verse is symbolically telling us where the fruit of The Knowledge of Good and Evil may be found. 


819
1:26:59,681 --> 1:27:5,92
Looking in the pine forest for apples would be a good start.


820
1:27:5,92 --> 1:27:11,359
Christians will agree that Christ is the Anointed One, as Christos means –Anointed One. 


821
1:27:11,359 --> 1:27:17,131
But anointed with what?


822
1:27:17,131 --> 1:27:24,639
The Chrism - as in the anointing oil…or Crisco – Chris…Co…. 


823
1:27:24,639 --> 1:27:27,508
the Cris Company, or Oil Company. 


824
1:27:27,508 --> 1:27:32,447
There are also associations to fertility worship that will be left for another time.


825
1:27:32,447 --> 1:27:38,219
When you think of Jesus Christ as the oil, or as the Medicine


826
1:27:38,219 --> 1:27:43,558
or Entheogens themselves, the miracles do make much more sense.


827
1:27:43,558 --> 1:27:49,497
Oil walking on water, and healing the sick with its touch is really only the beginning. 


828
1:27:49,497 --> 1:27:56,104
If Jesus was the Great Teacher, then why is it that we have no need for anyone to teach us 


829
1:27:56,104 --> 1:28:1,976
when all we need is the anointing to teach us of all things?


830
1:28:1,976 --> 1:28:9,717
It seems that this anointing is more important than the teacher.


831
1:28:9,717 --> 1:28:20,28
This holy oil was also used by the Monks who would shave rings around their heads and marinate a skullcap in entheogenically infused oil.


832
1:28:20,28 --> 1:28:33,74
This cap was then placed on the fresh razor burn on their heads 
836 
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:32,473 
and the ring of hair around their head would serve as a sponge preventing the oil from running into the eyes and down the face and neck.


833
1:28:33,74 --> 1:28:41,716
Witches practiced similar ceremonies.


834
1:28:41,716 --> 1:28:48,222
The woman would put green plant material all over her skin, consequently turning her skin green. 


835
1:28:48,222 --> 1:28:57,231
She would also put these oils in the most capillary-rich areas that she could find on her body, which just so happened to be between her legs. 


836
1:28:57,231 --> 1:29:7,875
The green witch with a broom handle between her legs has become the icon for the Halloween holiday.


837
1:29:7,875 --> 1:29:11,312
So we would like to talk about the mark of the beast for just a moment. 


838
1:29:11,312 --> 1:29:18,786
Today this mark has been reduced to a number, 666…or 600 – 60 – and 6


839
1:29:18,786 --> 1:29:25,827
This is how this was written in Ancient Greek, the language the New Testament was originally written in. 


840
1:29:25,827 --> 1:29:32,967
But before we get into this mark of the beast we would like to sidetrack for just a moment and talk about two other symbols.


841
1:29:32,967 --> 1:29:38,39
The Chi Rho is known as the monogram for Jesus Christ. 


842
1:29:38,39 --> 1:29:47,215
It’s made up of an X and a P


843
1:29:47,215 --> 1:29:55,356
The Greek name, Rho Chi is the universal symbol for pharmacy or drugs. It is the recipe for the pharmacy and the drugs 


844
1:29:55,356 --> 1:29:58,626
And again, Greek was the original language of the New Testament. 


845
1:29:58,626 --> 1:30:6,768
And in Greek the P and the R are interchangeable. 


846
1:30:6,768 --> 1:30:23,217
So if we take this X in the monogram of Christ and move it from an overlaid position to an inline position the RX is revealed.


847
1:30:23,217 --> 1:30:31,759
Is it a P, or is it an R? It is an interchangeable symbol for the drugs and for the deity.


848
1:30:31,759 --> 1:30:36,23
The Caduceus is directly related to Mercury. 


849
1:30:36,23 --> 1:30:40,201
The word “merchant” derives from the root of the word, “mer-cury.” 


850
1:30:40,201 --> 1:30:45,44
Mercury was the bearer of the caduceus, and was the one who gave permission to be a merchant 


851
1:30:45,44 --> 1:30:48,75
or to buy, sell, and trade. 


852
1:30:48,75 --> 1:30:53,915
To be a merchant, you had to have the symbol of Mercury, the caduceus. 


853
1:30:53,915 --> 1:31:8,596
To be a merchant, one also had to have the knowledge of the merchandise; this merchandise was commonly herbs, spices, and drugs.


854
1:31:8,596 --> 1:31:14,936
The coins used during this period were used to purchase these goods; on the front of this coin is Cesar Nero.


855
1:31:14,936 --> 1:31:21,576
On the back is the Caduceus and the Cornucopia. 


856
1:31:21,576 --> 1:31:26,614
The Caduceus was the mark that controlled the sale of the drugs back then, and it still is. 


857
1:31:26,614 --> 1:31:36,224
Today, no one can legally buy or sell medicine without this mark.


858
1:31:36,224 --> 1:31:40,528
Today, the dollar sign is a likely representation of the caduceus. 


859
1:31:40,528 --> 1:31:44,265
We still cannot buy or sell anything without this mark. 


860
1:31:44,265 --> 1:31:50,771
And, as a reversal of the single and dual snakes climbing the staff of Asclepius and the caduceus,


861
1:31:50,771 --> 1:31:53,441
the dollar sign is represented with a single serpent, and both single


862
1:31:53,441 --> 1:32:2,583
and dual vertical lines. 


863
1:32:2,583 --> 1:32:17,765
This is the Bank of England – inside the Dividend Office – Notice the caduceus on walls.


864
1:32:17,765 --> 1:32:23,771
The quest for the true manna, will guide you directly to entheogens… 


865
1:32:23,771 --> 1:32:33,247
This is a Psilocybe mushroom. These mushrooms are more common than the Amanita, and are often categorically labeled as “Shrooms” –


866
1:32:33,247 --> 1:32:42,657
their active ingredient is Psilocybin. 


867
1:32:42,657 --> 1:32:47,428
The Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center 


868
1:32:47,428 --> 1:32:53,367
is conducting a study designed to measure the effectiveness of the novel psychoactive medication psilocybin


869
1:32:53,367 --> 1:33:0,174
on the reduction of anxiety, depression, and physical pain. 


870
1:33:0,174 --> 1:33:4,278
All participants in this study have stage IV cancer and anxiety, 


871
1:33:4,278 --> 1:33:10,351
they are between the ages of 18 and 65, and do not have a history of major psychiatric disorders. 


872
1:33:10,351 --> 1:33:18,993
Participants spend two nights at the hospital, undergo an MRI scan of the brain, and receive psilocybin.  


873
1:33:18,993 --> 1:33:24,899
This is a double-blind study, meaning the participants are given a placebo and the active medication, 


874
1:33:24,899 --> 1:33:28,35
but they are not told which drug is administered when. 


875
1:33:28,35 --> 1:33:33,207
Participants are encouraged to bring along personal photos and some of their favorite music. 


876
1:33:33,207 --> 1:33:41,382
If this experience could be put into words, these cancer patients could either simply be told this mystery or undergo counseling…


877
1:33:41,382 --> 1:33:44,986
Only through the ingestion of a true sacrament (entheogens) can these terminally ill cancer patients 


878
1:33:44,986 --> 1:33:51,125
have such a profound experience that they no longer fear death; 


879
1:33:51,125 --> 1:33:56,564
this is a personal paradigm shift for each participant.


880
1:33:56,564 --> 1:34:2,136
Another recent study, performed by John Hopkins University, published in May of 2006 


881
1:34:2,136 --> 1:34:13,714
concluded that Psilocybin appeared to create the same experience as the ancient and mystical experiences found in our religions. 


882
1:34:13,714 --> 1:34:23,324
Harvard’s Good Friday experiment came to the same conclusion decades ago. 


883
1:34:23,324 --> 1:34:33,868
Inside Psilocybe mushrooms 
888 
is O phosphoryl–4-Hydroxy N,N–Dimethyltryptamine. – Dimethyltryptamine DMT, 


884
1:34:33,868 --> 1:34:42,109
keep this in mind because these three letters will come up often throughout the rest of this lecture.


885
1:34:42,109 --> 1:34:44,345
There were two types of Manna in the Bible, 


886
1:34:44,345 --> 1:34:48,616
Manna from heaven, which appeared many times during the voyage out of Egypt; 


887
1:34:48,616 --> 1:34:55,856
and the Hidden Manna, which is only mentioned once in Revelation.


888
1:34:55,856 --> 1:34:57,858
Moses as a Shaman


889
1:34:57,858 --> 1:35:2,563
As the story goes, before his celebrity status, Moses was a shepherd.


890
1:35:2,563 --> 1:35:6,967
He lived off of the land, eating herbs and building campfires.


891
1:35:6,967 --> 1:35:16,477
His life, in many ways, must have resembled the Native American or the Shaman that we have come to know.


892
1:35:16,477 --> 1:35:23,884
On at least two occasions, Moses wondered over to Mt. Sinai. 


893
1:35:23,884 --> 1:35:28,489
It was on this mountain, which was also called Horeb or Median over time, 


894
1:35:28,489 --> 1:35:31,926
that Moses encountered a bush that spoke to him…


895
1:35:31,926 --> 1:35:34,962
a bush that was on fire but did not burn…


896
1:35:34,962 --> 1:35:37,865
a burning bush that did not consume. 


897
1:35:37,865 --> 1:35:46,474
This bush spoke to him with a voice that could be none other than the voice of God.


898
1:35:46,474 --> 1:35:49,11
This truly sounds like a hallucination. 


899
1:35:49,11 --> 1:35:57,618
Inanimate objects speaking, visions of flames, communication with the gods, etc.


900
1:35:57,618 --> 1:36:1,55
The word Manna literally translates to “What is this?”


901
1:36:1,55 --> 1:36:9,396
This Manna was said to have appeared on the ground over night, and it came with the dew in the morning.


902
1:36:9,396 --> 1:36:13,934
Psilocybe mushrooms appear over night and flourish when there is dew on the ground.


903
1:36:13,934 --> 1:36:24,712
And, if it was your first time to eat these mushrooms, your reaction might just be – What is this? 


904
1:36:24,712 --> 1:36:29,316
A variety of Psilocybe containing mushrooms also grow atop the dung of cattle.


905
1:36:29,316 --> 1:36:38,793
The abundance of manure from their cattle would have provided ideal conditions for these mushrooms to grow.


906
1:36:38,793 --> 1:36:44,31
After fleeing Egypt, Moses did not wonder the wilderness for as long as some would think. 


907
1:36:44,31 --> 1:36:49,236
Moses knew where he was going and he took his people directly back 


908
1:36:49,236 --> 1:36:51,539
to Mt. Sinai where he first encountered the burning bush. 


909
1:36:51,539 --> 1:37:0,881
This is when he went back up the mountain and a few days later, he came down with the first set of 10 commandments.


910
1:37:0,881 --> 1:37:4,718
Since Moses had to travel to a certain location to speak to this bush.


911
1:37:4,718 --> 1:37:8,989
It can be suggested that Moses encountered the Hidden Manna on that mountain… 


912
1:37:8,989 --> 1:37:11,959
He found a mushroom that only grows in under trees, 


913
1:37:11,959 --> 1:37:14,728
one that looks like it is burning, but is not. 


914
1:37:14,728 --> 1:37:27,541
Knowing that he would find this hidden manna on this particular mountain, Moses went back there as soon has he could.


915
1:37:27,541 --> 1:37:30,277
Here is a photograph of a Psilocybe mushroom. 


916
1:37:30,277 --> 1:37:33,414
Notice that the stipe of the mushroom is turning blue. 


917
1:37:33,414 --> 1:37:42,723
When you grab a hold of these mushrooms and bruise them, they bruise blue, similar to a magnolia tree’s white flower bruising brown.


918
1:37:42,723 --> 1:37:45,893
Jesus is often represented wearing blue, 


919
1:37:45,893 --> 1:37:50,664
but even more significant symbolism of this mushroom can be found in India. 


920
1:37:50,664 --> 1:37:56,47
Because when you understand that these sacred plants helped sculpt all the major religions, it will make sense to learn that


921
1:37:56,47 --> 1:38:4,745
in Indian mythology, Lord Vishnu is blue in his incarnation as Krishna, 


922
1:38:4,745 --> 1:38:10,951
just like the body of the Psilocybe mushroom is blue. 


923
1:38:10,951 --> 1:38:12,953
Shiva has an extensive following. 


924
1:38:12,953 --> 1:38:17,524
According to Hindu mythology, when the demons and deities churned the Milky Ocean, 


925
1:38:17,524 --> 1:38:21,295
fourteen jewels surfaced, one of which was poison. 


926
1:38:21,295 --> 1:38:24,665
Poisonous fumes threatened to overwhelm the entire world, 


927
1:38:24,665 --> 1:38:28,335
so Shiva drank the poison.


928
1:38:28,335 --> 1:38:31,572
The poison was so intense that Shiva’s throat turned blue, 


929
1:38:31,572 --> 1:38:36,377
which is why Shiva earned the nickname Nilakantha, (the blue-throated).  


930
1:38:36,377 --> 1:38:42,783
Also, note the Third Eye in this image of Shiva.


931
1:38:42,783 --> 1:38:47,521
Here is Rama. Notice that there is no eye contact going on here


932
1:38:47,521 --> 1:38:54,662
Rama’s headdress seems to be the center of attention. 


933
1:38:54,662 --> 1:38:59,333
Krishna is also blue, and he is typically depicted with a cow or cattle. 


934
1:38:59,333 --> 1:39:4,972
Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms grow on cow dung. 


935
1:39:4,972 --> 1:39:13,28
As a result, holy cows produce holy crap, whereupon the holy sacrament grows in nature.


936
1:39:13,28 --> 1:39:15,549
Do these mushrooms stimulate the Kundalini? 


937
1:39:15,549 --> 1:39:18,419
This Kundalini energy will rise through the body.


938
1:39:18,419 --> 1:39:25,492
It will enlighten each of the chakras, including the third eye chakra and the crown chakra. 


939
1:39:25,492 --> 1:39:33,367
Notice once again, the symbol of the Caduceus inside our bodies.


940
1:39:33,367 --> 1:39:39,606
Kundalini literally translates into ‘snake or serpent power.’ 


941
1:39:39,606 --> 1:39:46,68
These serpents are climbing our spinal staff making the symbolic caduceus. 


942
1:39:46,68 --> 1:39:51,85
The third-eye chakra is often symbolized by placing a dot on the forehead. 


943
1:39:51,85 --> 1:39:57,624
Illuminating the third eye chakra will in turn burst open the crown chakra.


944
1:39:57,624 --> 1:40:1,762
The Native American Indian chief wears a feathered headdress to symbolize this. 


945
1:40:1,762 --> 1:40:10,838
The headdress is a representation of his crown chakra being wide open.


946
1:40:10,838 --> 1:40:16,643
This is symbolized often in different traditions. 


947
1:40:16,643 --> 1:40:25,219
Here in Christianity we see this crown chakra open, symbolized by placing a shell behind his head


948
1:40:25,219 --> 1:40:31,959
In the story of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit comes down onto man and rests over the heads of the people in the temple.


949
1:40:31,959 --> 1:40:40,634
The Holy Spirit, represented as a flame, is symbolic of crown chakra illumination. 


950
1:40:40,634 --> 1:40:50,177
DMT is the most psychedelic substance known to man and it is produced naturally in our bodies. 


951
1:40:50,177 --> 1:40:54,448
Dr. Rick Strassman, author of DMT the Spirit Molecule, 


952
1:40:54,448 --> 1:40:57,151
was (at the time his research began) 


953
1:40:57,151 --> 1:41:4,958
the first doctor allowed to perform psychedelic or entheogenic studies in the U.S. for over twenty years.


954
1:41:4,958 --> 1:41:10,931
With intravenous DMT injection, Strassman was able to recreate, unintentionally of course, 


955
1:41:10,931 --> 1:41:14,868
the alien abduction experience, as well as many levels of out of body 


956
1:41:14,868 --> 1:41:22,409
and “religious” experiences in a clinical setting.


957
1:41:22,409 --> 1:41:27,714
These same chemical compounds can be found in the excretions of a Bufo Alvarius Toad. 


958
1:41:27,714 --> 1:41:35,856
These excretions were dried and then smoked and the effects were extremely psychedelic.


959
1:41:35,856 --> 1:41:37,491
And then there is Ayahuasca. 


960
1:41:37,491 --> 1:41:42,29
This is a brew made from the combination of two plants found in the Amazon. 


961
1:41:42,29 --> 1:41:50,737
One contains DMT, but when it is consumed, our body’s break down before this chemical makes it into our bloodstream.


962
1:41:50,737 --> 1:41:59,613
the Shaman then found an MAO Inhibitor allowing the DMT to pass into the bloodstream without being destroyed in the gut.


963
1:41:59,613 --> 1:42:4,852
If you ask the Amazonian Shaman how they learned how to combine these plants to achieve this, 


964
1:42:4,852 --> 1:42:7,554
they would likely answer that the plants taught them. 


965
1:42:7,554 --> 1:42:10,924
More than likely, it was discovered in a salad like mixture.


966
1:42:10,924 --> 1:42:17,397
Joohn 2:27: As for you, the anointing you receive from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things, and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit -  just as it has taught you, remain in him.


967
1:42:17,397 --> 1:42:27,741
Four LSD like compounds exist naturally in the human brain. This is from the Boston Globe.


968
1:42:27,741 --> 1:42:34,815
Occult Anatomy 


969
1:42:34,815 --> 1:42:38,285
In our bodies, we have wings above our spinal staff.


970
1:42:38,285 --> 1:42:44,224
This darkened area, looking like wings, is the ventricle system of the brain. 


971
1:42:44,224 --> 1:42:52,833
The ventricle system in the brain is a series of cavities and chambers that allow cerebrospinal fluid to flow around the brain. 


972
1:42:52,833 --> 1:42:58,405
Cerebrospinal fluid is the fluid that brain floats in to protect itself from injury 


973
1:42:58,405 --> 1:43:4,811
and cerebral spinal fluid does indeed contain DMT.


974
1:43:4,811 --> 1:43:14,421
In Egyptian mythology, the Eye of Horus was pulled or plucked from the head of Horus by his brother, “Set.”


975
1:43:14,421 --> 1:43:18,659
Now we begin to understand from where the symbol of the Eye of Horus came. 


976
1:43:18,659 --> 1:43:25,666
It is literally the third eye system inside the human brain.


977
1:43:25,666 --> 1:43:32,573
The one Eye of Horus represents internal vision. 


978
1:43:32,573 --> 1:43:41,81
This internal vision, or this internal third eye, is opened by these mystifying substances found within the mushrooms


979
1:43:41,81 --> 1:43:46,186
and within these naturally occurring chemicals within our brains. 


980
1:43:46,186 --> 1:43:58,332
This visual/symbolic representation has an actual purpose, and that is why it is portrayed in such a particular way.


981
1:43:58,332 --> 1:44:6,406
A symbol can true on many scales and each has its different levels of meanings to the different groups who employ them.


982
1:44:6,406 --> 1:44:18,885
You could consider a simple triangle and the many degrees of understanding that this particular simple symbol can hold. 


983
1:44:18,885 --> 1:44:29,96
With keys like this, you can unlock the most elaborate alchemical artwork and decipher its meaning.


984
1:44:29,96 --> 1:44:34,334
And through this natural progression it would make sense to create a character or deity 


985
1:44:34,334 --> 1:44:51,518
full of characteristics that represent greater things than the symbol itself.


986
1:44:51,518 --> 1:44:57,891
This is non-verbal knowledge has been passed down via symbolism, artwork, deities; 


987
1:44:57,891 --> 1:45:3,63
it’s been written in the stars 


988
1:45:3,63 --> 1:45:8,335
and hidden in plain sight.


989
1:45:8,335 --> 1:45:19,479
All of it sitting there waiting for us to come along and claim ownership to our inheritance.


990
1:45:19,479 --> 1:45:25,752
If, then, we project the Essenism of Qumran forward in time and place 


991
1:45:25,752 --> 1:45:28,755
from the Dead Sea Scrolls to the New Testament,


992
1:45:28,755 --> 1:45:33,96
we can see a clear line of theological speculation 


993
1:45:33,96 --> 1:45:46,106
which transformed an exclusive Jewish sectarianism into a Hellenistic mystery religion which could attract the allegiance of all men, 


994
1:45:46,106 --> 1:45:49,91
Jew or Gentile, bond or free.


995
1:45:49,91 --> 1:45:55,449
But the kind of Christianity we arrive at 


996
1:45:55,449 --> 1:46:3,323
is that not of a faith committed to the historicity of Jesus and the gospel tradition, 


997
1:46:3,323 --> 1:46:9,896
and the imposition of a single canon and a tyrannical Creed,


998
1:46:9,896 --> 1:46:18,705
but to that gnostic “heresy” whose essential individualism was so abhorred by the so-called Great Church 


999
1:46:18,705 --> 1:46:21,641
and which became the target of a persecution 


1000
1:46:21,641 --> 1:46:28,815
no less ruthless than that of the movement’s first political and religious enemies. 


1001
1:46:28,815 --> 1:46:38,992
And to judge from the Church’s subsequent history as well as the illegitimacy of its claims to primacy… 


1002
1:46:38,992 --> 1:46:45,532
One can not help but feel that the wrong side gan - 
One can’t help feeling that the wrong side won.
