0:0:3,8 --> 0:0:9,59
Word up Food Tubers. Ok it's only a few days
until Pancake Day! So we're gonna do a whole


2
0:0:9,59 --> 0:0:14,34
bunch of pancake recipes across Food Tube.
So everybody's gonna have a little go, and


3
0:0:14,34 --> 0:0:21,279
today I'm gonna do a lovely little brunchy
sort of L.A twist on fluffy pancakes with


4
0:0:21,279 --> 0:0:26,46
gorgeous smoky bacon. In the pancakes there's
gonna be sweetcorn and feta cheese. There's


5
0:0:26,46 --> 0:0:33,489
gonna be avocado, it's gonna be gorgeous.
But I have a new guest, yeah! Alex is here.


6
0:0:33,489 --> 0:0:38,75
French Guy Cooking is in the house. Hello
Food Tubers how are you?


7
0:0:38,75 --> 0:0:43,94
Hi guys and welcome to French Guy Cooking.
This is an amazing fruit. Then blaze it! We


8
0:0:43,94 --> 0:0:48,859
pour this over the steak.
He's come here to cook and he's French. And


9
0:0:48,859 --> 0:0:53,98
he was one of the runner-uppers in the competition
we did to find a new Food Tube star and he


10
0:0:53,98 --> 0:0:56,629
did fantastic and his channel is going down
really well.


11
0:0:56,629 --> 0:1:0,679
I'm an Essex boy now.
You are an Essex boy now. There's a few more


12
0:1:0,679 --> 0:1:3,87
initiations that we have to go through but
you're nearly there, yes.


13
0:1:3,87 --> 0:1:7,83
And if you wanna see some pancakes, you wanna
check out his channel. You gonna do a lovely


14
0:1:7,83 --> 0:1:10,22
Crepe?
Oh yeah, totally. Sweet, sweet one.


15
0:1:10,22 --> 0:1:13,52
Beautiful. So are you ready to see my one?
I'm waiting for it.


16
0:1:13,52 --> 0:1:18,4
It's not classic French. This is a really,
really easy recipe guys. All you need is a


17
0:1:18,4 --> 0:1:24,55
tea mug, a builders mug, whatever you wanna
call it. We're gonna pour this into the mug.


18
0:1:24,55 --> 0:1:28,92
See the thing is Alex, I don't really like
weighing things too much. It's all about cups


19
0:1:28,92 --> 0:1:34,25
and spoons and handfuls. For one cup of self-raising
flour we're gonna do one cup of milk. Do you


20
0:1:34,25 --> 0:1:39,1
mind pouring that in there for me. Yeah totally,
totally. And one egg, Okay? And then a little


21
0:1:39,1 --> 0:1:45,5
pinch of salt. But if you can just whisk that
for me my French brother. Yeah totally. But


22
0:1:45,5 --> 0:1:49,95
we're gonna go savoury. You don't want any
lumps do you? You can try and get rid of the


23
0:1:49,95 --> 0:1:53,3
lumps, yeah.
20g of feta. But I wanna use a sweetcorn.


24
0:1:53,3 --> 0:1:58,86
We're gonna hold it like this and I'm gonna
run my knife all the way down like this. So


25
0:1:58,86 --> 0:2:4,15
I'm just gonna take that off like that. How's
it going Alex? It's good, it's perfect.


26
0:2:4,15 --> 0:2:9,34
Lovely, I would expect nothing less from you.
Mmm. So Alex over here with the batter my


27
0:2:9,34 --> 0:2:15,7
friend. And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
crumble some feta in there. We're gonna go


28
0:2:15,7 --> 0:2:21,0
in with the sweetcorn. I've got a pan here
on a medium heat so I'm just gonna put in


29
0:2:21,0 --> 0:2:25,53
my rashers here. So Alex you've got your own
channel now - French Guy Cooking.


30
0:2:25,53 --> 0:2:27,18
It is.
Come on, tell them all about it.


31
0:2:27,18 --> 0:2:31,99
It really is a simple channel, you know, the
most simple you can get French cooking to.


32
0:2:31,99 --> 0:2:37,78
I mean, hearty dishes, don't want to be Frenchy
only. I want it to be, you know, worldwide;


33
0:2:37,78 --> 0:2:43,0
Asian twists, Italian, Lebanese. But that's
nice, it's inspiring because it means if he


34
0:2:43,0 --> 0:2:48,72
can do it, you can do it.
Ok push this down, let's get it crispy. It's


35
0:2:48,72 --> 0:2:53,65
totally amazing! It's smelling really good.
We wanna just turn those over. Perfectly golden.


36
0:2:53,65 --> 0:2:59,79
The best bit at the moment happening here
is like the caramelisation of the bacon, but


37
0:2:59,79 --> 0:3:5,709
the fat coming out. So I'm gonna use that
fat to cook my pancakes. So the bacon's nearly


38
0:3:5,709 --> 0:3:11,569
there. I'm gonna do a very, very simple piece
of avocado and I'm literally just gonna dress


39
0:3:11,569 --> 0:3:17,65
it in a little salt, a little pepper, just
a little bit of lime zest over the top is


40
0:3:17,65 --> 0:3:22,68
very, very nice and a little lime juice. This
will stop the avocado discolouring but it


41
0:3:22,68 --> 0:3:27,2
will just give it the most wonderful sort
of flavour. And the whole point of this dish


42
0:3:27,2 --> 0:3:32,15
is it's comforting but also it wakes you up.
So just remove the bacon, lovely and crisp.


43
0:3:32,15 --> 0:3:35,69
That goes here. Just gonna turn it down a
little bit.


44
0:3:35,69 --> 0:3:41,99
So I'm gonna give you bacon fat. Give it a
shake my brother. I wanna do nice, just a


45
0:3:41,99 --> 0:3:46,54
couple of little pancakes there, just like
that.


46
0:3:46,54 --> 0:3:51,31
Can you do the same my friend?
Beautiful. I'll try.


47
0:3:51,31 --> 0:3:55,6
It doesn't matter if they're not perfectly
round. As my Nan used to say - it all goes


48
0:3:55,6 --> 0:3:57,819
down the same hole.
What we wanna do is when these little bubbles


49
0:3:57,819 --> 0:4:3,5
come to the top here, right I'm gonna get
in, under and just flip that bad boy over.


50
0:4:3,5 --> 0:4:5,8
Look at that!
So the pancakes they're nearly done. I've


51
0:4:5,8 --> 0:4:11,62
got my bacon, I've got my avocado and of course
I'm gonna take a couple of our lovely pancakes


52
0:4:11,62 --> 0:4:21,419
here. I'm gonna stack them up just like this.
I'm gonna just hit up the bacon, just a couple


53
0:4:21,419 --> 0:4:28,449
of bits of that with some avocado. So a little
bit of the old lime juice on the avocados


54
0:4:28,449 --> 0:4:32,509
and then just a little bit of yoghurt and..
Chilli sauce!


55
0:4:32,509 --> 0:4:37,62
Yes, chilli. And then just a little coriander.
So there you go. That is my Californian style


56
0:4:37,62 --> 0:4:43,18
brunch. This one is for this lovely man right
here. Thank you Jamie. There you go Alex.


57
0:4:43,18 --> 0:4:48,529
There's a fork to eat it with. And Alex is
gonna make a beautiful French style Crepe


58
0:4:48,529 --> 0:4:53,8
with, tell us what's on the topping.
I mean the topping will be a sweet one. we


59
0:4:53,8 --> 0:4:58,789
will have some caramel, some butter and you
know, it's just sweetness. What do you call


60
0:4:58,789 --> 0:5:1,77
it in French?
We call it Caramel beurre sale.


61
0:5:1,77 --> 0:5:6,86

beurre sale then click on his head right now,
