###13 CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON: I'm still endlessly fascinated by
###15 what is that magic dust that, sprinkled on a certain image,
###19 makes it more powerful than another image?
###22 It goes so far beyond composition and lighting all
###27 those things.
###28 But yet, it's kind of all those things mixed together.
###31 And that's the essence of what is interesting about
###35 photography to me.
###37 
###45 Oh man, I love when the city looks like that.
###47 
###52 My name is Christopher Anderson,
###54 full member in Magnum.
###58 There was a certain idea, the notion that this camera could
###62 represent for me, especially growing up in a
###66 small town in Texas.
###68 This little machine represented a way out.
###74 So there was that sense of having an idea of wanting to
###79 do something with this.
###81 But what that really meant of being a professional--
###84 no.
###87 When I got out of university, I was
###89 planning to go into academia.
###92 But a friend of my family got me a job in "The Dallas
###95 Morning News" printing pictures and
###98 developing film there.
###99 I did that as a summer job, and I knew then I wanted to be
###102 a photographer somehow.
###103 And I was never going to go back to academia.
###107 I got really lucky.
###108 Someone gave me a job to take pictures before I even really
###112 understood that there was a job description of
###115 professional photographer.
###117 I had no formal training.
###119 I really didn't know how to work a camera.
###121 I certainly had no journalism training.
###124 I became this professional and learned on the job.
###128 And I spent many years just trying to do my job as good as
###133 I could do it before I ever start really thinking about
###136 putting very basic questions to myself, like what is a
###141 photograph?
###141 And what do I want my photographs to represent?
###145 Those sort of questions came to me much later.
###148 
###151 Here's the Haiti boat story--
###152 
###156 June 18, 2000.
###160 In Haiti, this writer and I--
###162 Michael Finkel--
###164 met this guy in Haiti who told us an amazing story about
###169 trying to get on a boat and sail to the United States.
###174 We got on one of these boats--
###176 44 Haitians plus myself and the writer.
###180 And we set sail.
###183 
###186 And a few days later, we started sinking.
###189 That moment in the boat when we realized
###192 that we were sinking---
###193 up until that point, I hadn't taken many photographs.
###197 And the guy we were with, David, says, Chris, you'd
###203 better start taking pictures now.
###204 We're going to be dead in 45 minutes.
###207 Without thinking too much about it, I begin making
###210 photographs, as we were literally saying goodbye to
###213 each other.
###214 
###217 This is the guy, David.
###218 That was the moment we realized we were sinking.
###223 You can see the water coming in from the
###224 inside of the boat there.
###225 
###228 And later on, after that, I thought about that moment over
###234 and over again, asking myself the question, why make
###239 photographs that I assumed no one would see?
###243 And the only answer that I could come up with was that
###248 the actual act of making pictures, photography in and
###251 of itself, it had as much to do for me about explaining the
###256 world to myself as it did explaining it to someone else.
###261 The very act of photography was part of how
###264 I understood things.
###267 It crystallized the notion, the idea of what it was I
###276 thought about photography and what I
###278 wanted to do with pictures.
###282 It changed everything.
###283 
###294 And from that point, I guess editors thought that I was
###298 looking for danger and was willing to go through some
###303 discomfort.
###306 So I started getting offers to do the obvious thing, which is
###309 go to wars.
###310 And that set about-- the next several years was this kind of
###314 blur from Israel, Palestine to Lebanon to Africa to Iraq,
###322 Afghanistan.
###324 But with a clear idea of what I wanted the
###327 pictures to be about.
###330 I wanted to find a way for someone to feel what it was
###335 that I experienced--
###337 an emotional quality that cut through all the ideas of facts
###343 and journalism, but went straight to something else,
###346 which is an emotional truth.
###348 
###352 I don't know if I made a conscious decision to stop
###354 doing wars or not.
###356 Part of it's I had a child.
###358 One skill set that I had in doing that kind of work was
###361 that I was able to remain relatively calm in those
###365 situations.
###365 And now, I felt like I didn't trust how I would react.
###369 But there's also the other side of me, which is that, for
###373 me, there was never this oh, I used to be that and now I've
###377 become this.
###378 It's just we grow and we change as human beings.
###382 So even from a creative standpoint, I'm taken in
###385 different directions now--
###386 portraits, for instance.
###388 And really looking at why I like some portraits--
###393 why some portraiture is compelling and others are not.
###396 And me, not coming from any formal, technical training of
###400 photography, forcing myself to learn some of those things in
###406 order to pull off what it is that I want to photograph.
###411 Yeah, I kind of like those challenges.
###412 
###415 [INAUDIBLE].
###416 [PRETEND MONSTER GROWL]
###418 [LAUGHING]
###421 What did you have?
###422 What did I have?
###423 Mmhm.
###424 What do you mean, what did I have?
###425 No, a present.
###426 A present?
###427 Mmhm.
###427 If I have a present?
###428 Mmhm.
###430 The son project--
###432 the photographs of my son and my father--
###435 really happened quite organically in the sense that
###438 I had a kid.
###439 It started like any father taking pictures of their kid.
###444 At about the same time, my father became ill.
###448 And so I was thinking about very obvious themes of the
###455 cycles of life and death.
###457 And that's the weird thing about parenthood--
###461 is completely universal and mundane.
###464 And at the same time, it's completely unique and intimate
###468 and special.
###470 And so I began photographing my father and my son, and at
###474 the beginning, just without thinking about it.
###478 And it started to dawn on me that what I was seeing in the
###482 pictures was that quality that I felt like I'd been on a
###489 search for since I first started using a camera.
###494 And that everything that I had photographed up until that
###498 point was as if it were just some sort of preparation to
###504 bring me to that point, to provide me with the tools or
###510 the insight or whatever it was in order
###512 to make those pictures.
###514 And that that was my life's work.
###518 It was very quick, also, because that particular set of
###521 pictures loses its magic the moment that it becomes a
###527 conscious work.
###530 Flash card, camera, lenses, extra battery.
###536 
###545 See, I always want to take a picture right here.
###548 And I can't.
###549 I'd have to park my car.
###550 
###556 The work I'm doing now with "New York Magazine," it's a
###559 big change for me, because I'm staying mostly at home to do
###563 it after years of having worked mostly in strange
###568 places around the world.
###571 Check this out, this old Bronx courthouse that's just bricked
###577 up and empty.
###578 
###581 And also, for me, it is an extension of what
###584 the son work was.
###586 The son photographs are this first time where I look at my
###591 own world, at this city in which I live, and the people
###596 that I live with in this city.
###597 And so in that sense, the work retains this personal edge to
###604 it, this personal connection--
###606 my world of New York and my friendships with other
###609 photographers and artists and writers.
###612 And it's part of this collective experience that
###615 we're having now that I'm privileged enough to get to
###619 photograph in a concentrated way.
###620 
###634 Yeah, I don't know Spanish Harlem as well as
###639 I would like to.
###640 I would like to really explore it more.
###644 Wow, there is a--
###646 I'm going to try to stop here, because there's a great shot.
###648 And these aren't really the projects that we're looking
###650 at, but I see a great shot here.
###652 
###656 I go out, and I think of it as I start turning over rocks and
###660 see what I find underneath.
###662 And sometimes, you find the most interesting
###664 things under a rock.
###666 
###668 And sometimes, you find nothing.
###670 
###677 But a lot of it is just about going out and meeting people
###682 and seeing where that leads to.
###685 Hello.
###685 Hi.
###686 Are you Ms. [INAUDIBLE]?
###687 No.
###687 No?
###688 Is she--
###688 She's not here.
###689 She's not here.
###689 Oh.
###690 I heard she takes care of the gardens.
###692 Is that right?
###693 Yeah.
###694 What's that?
###696 She went to the store.
###696 They said she'd be back in a little bit.
###698 There she is right there.
###699 But that's my garden right there.
###700 Oh, you have a garden here, too?
###702 Yeah.
###702 Oh, great.
###703 We met a couple of women who have tended
###706 gardens outside of projects.
###709 They were a connection into this world.
###712 
###715 You never know what that leads to.
###717 You never know when you get invited in for tea or
###722 whatever, and all of sudden, this other world opens up to
###727 you that you would have never known just by walking by or
###732 just by showing up.
###733 
###740 There's no winners and there's no losers out here.
###743 Everybody wins.
###745 I want ya'll to understand that.
###746 Nobody loses.
###747 Everybody wins in this tournament.
###749 If there's one word that I hope describes my pictures--
###755 the gist of my pictures-- it's intimacy.
###757 And that requires an interaction with people, to
###762 some extent.
###763 I want the pictures to feel more than just this shadow
###768 that passes by and stops a scene.
###774 I want it to feel engaged and connected.
###777 
###783 New York is one of the strange places to photograph, because
###786 first of all, it's terribly photogenic.
###789 There are pictures-- there are cliches everywhere.
###791 But there's this light bouncing around.
###793 There's this, graphically, these big buildings and
###797 canyons of the streets and these characters
###800 all over the place.
###801 And also, it's overwhelming.
###803 It's daunting--
###805 this idea of photographing New York, because it is a genre in
###807 and of itself.
###809 It's a photographic cliche.
###810 
###817 You feel overwhelmed by this idea.
###820 How can I ever attempt to do that?
###825 It's all been done before.
###827 At the same time, it hasn't been done, I feel, from my
###832 point of view right now in this year, this week, today.
###836 
###840 As I'm working, I'm thinking of these images that I make on
###845 the street today, what that picture will mean
###849 10 years from now.
###850 I think sometimes pictures age well in the sense that today,
###855 it's a picture that doesn't look like much or it
###857 doesn't mean much.
###858 But can you imagine this thing 10 years from now, 20 years
###862 from now, 50 years from now?
###864 That's how photography, to me, is interesting.
###866 It's not just that moment.
###868 It's not just today.
###869 It's something that's a longer thing.
###873 So yeah, I'm aware of the assignment today, and I go out
###875 and I do that, do my work, and do it correctly.
###879 But really, as I'm doing an assignment, it's about the
###881 longer view, the bigger picture, and how this thing
###885 becomes a piece of a much larger puzzle.
###888
