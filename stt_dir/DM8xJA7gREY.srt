1
0:0:0,169 --> 0:0:4,76
we have a compromise we have a combines
all watching this celebrating


2
0:0:4,76 --> 0:0:8,579
and i was in a compromise anytime there
is a compromise


3
0:0:8,579 --> 0:0:10,609
all of the pundits and reporter


4
0:0:10,609 --> 0:0:11,639
arisen


5
0:0:11,639 --> 0:0:18,779
uh... republicans and democrats on
capitol hill go crazy at bat we started


6
0:0:18,779 --> 0:0:20,32
so what exactly did they do


7
0:0:20,32 --> 0:0:24,96
well this on background checks so it
looks like something's gonna pass while


8
0:0:24,96 --> 0:0:26,789
ok maybe maybe


9
0:0:26,789 --> 0:0:29,559
son set in stone yet and there are a
soul pose


10
0:0:29,559 --> 0:0:32,87
so uh... what is going to pass well


11
0:0:32,87 --> 0:0:35,97
gottschalk while they didn't have it
that sounds pretty good right


12
0:0:35,97 --> 0:0:37,18
and and


13
0:0:37,18 --> 0:0:39,739
online sales i also


14
0:0:39,739 --> 0:0:43,469
and as we did get a minute that like you
can't have any decision you know that


15
0:0:43,469 --> 0:0:44,53
grant ect


16
0:0:44,53 --> 0:0:45,39
so most


17
0:0:45,39 --> 0:0:47,739
symbol in the world as we said a million
times


18
0:0:47,739 --> 0:0:49,469
ninety one percent of americans


19
0:0:49,469 --> 0:0:53,42
agree there should be background checks
that but don't get too excited


20
0:0:53,42 --> 0:0:55,38
because there is a little paull


21
0:0:55,38 --> 0:0:56,81
loophole is


22
0:0:56,81 --> 0:1:0,9
well regards as know each other and it's
just a private sale


23
0:1:0,9 --> 0:1:2,63
that's totally ok


24
0:1:2,63 --> 0:1:6,28
well that creates a bit of a problem
right adam winkler who is well the


25
0:1:6,28 --> 0:1:9,49
topics in the country about this is a
law professor at u_c_l_a_


26
0:1:9,49 --> 0:1:11,83
he's author of gunfight


27
0:1:11,83 --> 0:1:15,8
the battle wrote the right to bear arms
in america respected by both sides he


28
0:1:15,8 --> 0:1:16,479
says


29
0:1:16,479 --> 0:1:19,689
it doesn't close a private sale will
pull it just reshape said


30
0:1:19,689 --> 0:1:21,65
in fact look at this is a squall


31
0:1:21,65 --> 0:1:24,44
private sale still won't require
background check


32
0:1:24,44 --> 0:1:27,11
so long as they occur outside ago show


33
0:1:27,11 --> 0:1:29,81
or without a publicized advertisement


34
0:1:29,81 --> 0:1:32,95
there's nothing the law that prevents
someone from going to a gun show


35
0:1:32,95 --> 0:1:34,71
finding the gun he likes


36
0:1:34,71 --> 0:1:37,89
than meeting the seller offsite to
complete the cell without a background


37
0:1:37,89 --> 0:1:39,22
check


38
0:1:39,22 --> 0:1:42,14
well that's your id chariot loophole
deguerin


39
0:1:42,14 --> 0:1:43,61
drive a mac truck through


40
0:1:43,61 --> 0:1:46,979
so welcomed the compromise


41
0:1:46,979 --> 0:1:49,31
by the way there are a still opposes it


42
0:1:49,31 --> 0:1:50,999
okay now we had to learn a second


43
0:1:50,999 --> 0:1:54,849
that there is something else looks like
is gonna pass which is hey you know what


44
0:1:54,849 --> 0:1:58,2
we had an attractive os guns they're
going to legal


45
0:1:58,2 --> 0:1:58,869
ed


46
0:1:58,869 --> 0:2:0,48
purposes okay


47
0:2:0,48 --> 0:2:5,249
elise straw men sales with somebody buys
if someone else and gives them


48
0:2:5,249 --> 0:2:8,789
is a camp asa background check or
something along those lines well you may


49
0:2:8,789 --> 0:2:12,519
get a crack crime to buy guns and they
have been vigils legally barred from


50
0:2:12,519 --> 0:2:14,869
possessing does wow that's really tough


51
0:2:14,869 --> 0:2:15,81
too which is that possible


52
0:2:15,81 --> 0:2:19,299
has of course i can really go ok alright
hold on


53
0:2:19,299 --> 0:2:21,55
but it would also make it explicitly
will you go


54
0:2:21,55 --> 0:2:26,659
to traffic tour more guns the person had
reasonable cause to believe a crime


55
0:2:26,659 --> 0:2:29,449
would be committed with any of those
fireworks


56
0:2:29,449 --> 0:2:31,249
as lobbing oppose is they're awesome


57
0:2:31,249 --> 0:2:33,79
did you hear that


58
0:2:33,79 --> 0:2:36,29
if you think somebody's gonna commit a
crime


59
0:2:36,29 --> 0:2:40,599
you can't sell two or more guns to them


60
0:2:40,599 --> 0:2:45,169
anyone i mean come on when you do not so
much dot nancy according to some assault


61
0:2:45,169 --> 0:2:46,219
weapon


62
0:2:46,219 --> 0:2:50,149
buddy you know him twelve cell two or
three of the message will straight


63
0:2:50,149 --> 0:2:54,609
these are the compromises that come out
of washington


64
0:2:54,609 --> 0:2:57,9
bucket el portal to celebrate this


65
0:2:57,9 --> 0:2:58,63
was about to celebrate


66
0:2:58,63 --> 0:3:2,349
excuse me for not celebrated by the way
the celebrity about that


67
0:3:2,349 --> 0:3:4,829
have gotten gotten god


68
0:3:4,829 --> 0:3:10,579
can't happy here and i think that's the
magazine van


69
0:3:10,579 --> 0:3:15,409
that the issue and have travel invented
by both a very short period of time


70
0:3:15,409 --> 0:3:16,75
having times and then then


71
0:3:16,75 --> 0:3:19,689
and tackle while reloading all the time


72
0:3:19,689 --> 0:3:23,99
but they don't have to reload very much
resembles mike tyson is guilty of is


73
0:3:23,99 --> 0:3:24,109
that ban those


74
0:3:24,109 --> 0:3:30,18
not weekend than those not not not not
cellular well consideration


75
0:3:30,18 --> 0:3:33,869
the republicans were filibustering all
this anyway


76
0:3:33,869 --> 0:3:36,3
this walk down piece of crap they work


77
0:3:36,3 --> 0:3:37,89
filibuster


78
0:3:37,89 --> 0:3:38,349
now luckily


79
0:3:38,349 --> 0:3:40,619
they lost


80
0:3:40,619 --> 0:3:44,739
they at sixty eight votes to break the
filibuster why i


81
0:3:44,739 --> 0:3:47,279
for taking


82
0:3:47,279 --> 0:3:48,82
not impressed by any of this


83
0:3:48,82 --> 0:3:51,679
now of course president obama set the
tone early on


84
0:3:51,679 --> 0:3:56,25
when in the state of the speech he gave
this rousing but completely nonsensical


85
0:3:56,25 --> 0:3:58,179
uh... applause line


86
0:3:58,179 --> 0:3:59,409
grabbing get hurt


87
0:3:59,409 --> 0:4:3,169
the


88
0:4:3,169 --> 0:4:7,789
family and


89
0:4:7,789 --> 0:4:11,899
family


90
0:4:11,899 --> 0:4:19,799
family uh... here


91
0:4:19,799 --> 0:4:22,88
uh...


92
0:4:22,88 --> 0:4:26,189
and


93
0:4:26,189 --> 0:4:31,699
now at warner back then that or yes was
for a boat you know so we look


94
0:4:31,699 --> 0:4:35,139
so finally he's getting about but not
all the things he says he won the vote


95
0:4:35,139 --> 0:4:36,6
on so let me is


96
0:4:36,6 --> 0:4:38,379
mike tyson exists at a


97
0:4:38,379 --> 0:4:40,76
night universal background check


98
0:4:40,76 --> 0:4:42,96
this is a non universal background check


99
0:4:42,96 --> 0:4:44,13
there's a background check


100
0:4:44,13 --> 0:4:46,1
if you're an idiot you can't get past it


101
0:4:46,1 --> 0:4:48,35
they play at the end of the parking lot


102
0:4:48,35 --> 0:4:49,54
and by the gun there


103
0:4:49,54 --> 0:4:50,46
okay great


104
0:4:50,46 --> 0:4:54,169
so present obama's gonna be a guest in
something like this is


105
0:4:54,169 --> 0:4:55,259
this is almost here


106
0:4:55,259 --> 0:4:57,319
nothing right this is so water dept


107
0:4:57,319 --> 0:5:0,22
utah balmy elizabeth also party


108
0:5:0,22 --> 0:5:4,729
immediately cisa well this is quote this
is not my bill there are aspects of the


109
0:5:4,729 --> 0:5:7,289
agreement that i might for to be
stronger


110
0:5:7,289 --> 0:5:10,59
they're good people on both sides of
this issue now what i think we have


111
0:5:10,59 --> 0:5:13,18
everything to know that we've gotten do
something


112
0:5:13,18 --> 0:5:15,199
december title dot box


113
0:5:15,199 --> 0:5:16,839
now a lot of work remains


114
0:5:16,839 --> 0:5:20,639
the senate must overcome obstruction by
defeating a threatened filibuster


115
0:5:20,639 --> 0:5:23,6
and allow boat on this another
common-sense reforms


116
0:5:23,6 --> 0:5:28,66
to protect our kids in our communities
anne bill still has a clear the house


117
0:5:28,66 --> 0:5:30,629
understand all things he's doing there


118
0:5:30,629 --> 0:5:34,439
well you know i didn't give you what you
wanted but it's a tiny bit up five


119
0:5:34,439 --> 0:5:35,909
percent change


120
0:5:35,909 --> 0:5:37,68
mentioned complex


121
0:5:37,68 --> 0:5:41,63
historic on reform a layout we had
overcome of that uh... photo so we get


122
0:5:41,63 --> 0:5:45,449
all thanks got we finally have all about
it what different inbuilt them by the


123
0:5:45,449 --> 0:5:46,36
way you see that


124
0:5:46,36 --> 0:5:47,8
then a but don't get me wrong


125
0:5:47,8 --> 0:5:51,0
even though i didn't get ninety nine
point five percent of what i wanted


126
0:5:51,0 --> 0:5:55,41
it's also clear the house don't don't
worry about me arcade neatly say yes


127
0:5:55,41 --> 0:6:0,449
all worry about the republicans want
they want so yes i was


128
0:6:0,449 --> 0:6:4,189
uh... he then goes on to say so what did
he pass the american people stand up and


129
0:6:4,189 --> 0:6:5,519
raise their voices


130
0:6:5,519 --> 0:6:9,31
because these measures to serve a boat
and so the families and communities


131
0:6:9,31 --> 0:6:11,2
they're designed to protect


132
0:6:11,2 --> 0:6:14,96
uh... ok self that's the one side of the
equation he gets very little of what he


133
0:6:14,96 --> 0:6:15,7
wanted


134
0:6:15,7 --> 0:6:19,719
and he's firing off by our war straight
and say and work hard


135
0:6:19,719 --> 0:6:23,259
and on the lively for this watered down


136
0:6:23,259 --> 0:6:24,749
tiny little bit of reform


137
0:6:24,749 --> 0:6:26,449
now we turn to the n_r_a_


138
0:6:26,449 --> 0:6:27,719
what is their position


139
0:6:27,719 --> 0:6:31,46
and they got almost everything they
wanted they'll even mind the provision


140
0:6:31,46 --> 0:6:32,71
that if yours


141
0:6:32,71 --> 0:6:35,3
selling to a guy you know it's gonna
commit a crime


142
0:6:35,3 --> 0:6:40,89
ish in some to guns wow what a we got on
that one ok thanks guys right


143
0:6:40,89 --> 0:6:43,639
but did you want a provision


144
0:6:43,639 --> 0:6:46,199
even though it's got a jury a loophole
you're doing a background check as


145
0:6:46,199 --> 0:6:46,849
somebody


146
0:6:46,849 --> 0:6:49,8
kazan they wanna make illegal gun by a


147
0:6:49,8 --> 0:6:52,809
more position 'cause they're upset
gunmen effect as the one i have


148
0:6:52,809 --> 0:6:54,57
more criminals with guns


149
0:6:54,57 --> 0:6:57,79
cuz then this here's the regular
citizens to the criminals buy more guns


150
0:6:57,79 --> 0:6:58,899
and the regular citizens


151
0:6:58,899 --> 0:7:2,8
is here to buy more guns of course
n_r_a_ once


152
0:7:2,8 --> 0:7:6,949
illegal gun sales right or gun sales to
people who commit crimes with a much


153
0:7:6,949 --> 0:7:10,9
insight and they're not gonna be leagues
n_r_a_'s preventing them from being a


154
0:7:10,9 --> 0:7:13,979
legal so chris cox their head of n_r_a_
inappropriately named


155
0:7:13,979 --> 0:7:18,199
says there are a will oppose any
amendments offered to as six four nine


156
0:7:18,199 --> 0:7:20,97
they restrict fundamental second then
the freedoms including but not limited


157
0:7:20,97 --> 0:7:22,689
to proposals that would ban


158
0:7:22,689 --> 0:7:26,509
probably lawfully owned firearms and
magazines or penalize the private


159
0:7:26,509 --> 0:7:27,939
transfer or firearms


160
0:7:27,939 --> 0:7:30,71
than expansion a background checks


161
0:7:30,71 --> 0:7:31,75
this includes a


162
0:7:31,75 --> 0:7:35,32
misguided compromise proposal drafted by
senator still mansion


163
0:7:35,32 --> 0:7:36,88
pat toomey chat show work


164
0:7:36,88 --> 0:7:40,569
as we have noted previously spending
account shows or also air


165
0:7:40,569 --> 0:7:44,13
will not reduce violent crime or keep
our kids safe in their schools


166
0:7:44,13 --> 0:7:45,69
given the importance of these issues


167
0:7:45,69 --> 0:7:50,33
though some all in tiananmen minsk or
proposals will be considered in n_r_a_'s


168
0:7:50,33 --> 0:7:53,939
future candidate evaluations


169
0:7:53,939 --> 0:7:58,15
in other words no no no no no knocked it


170
0:7:58,15 --> 0:8:0,459
that's all we give you an actor


171
0:8:0,459 --> 0:8:4,929
no background checks whatsoever if you
want corn any way shape or form or a


172
0:8:4,929 --> 0:8:9,549
great jointly will run ads against his
allies guy is not a garden that is india


173
0:8:9,549 --> 0:8:12,529
it terrible like apple tv grease on
ninety-one


174
0:8:12,529 --> 0:8:14,789
presented because that's what they're
threatening to do


175
0:8:14,789 --> 0:8:16,91
uh... seem so scary period


176
0:8:16,91 --> 0:8:18,12
he live in a democracy


177
0:8:18,12 --> 0:8:20,39
but in reality what they're going to do
is


178
0:8:20,39 --> 0:8:24,29
bier spent as lying about your record et
cetera they possess when they use the


179
0:8:24,29 --> 0:8:25,439
money for so


180
0:8:25,439 --> 0:8:27,59
but it gets worse


181
0:8:27,59 --> 0:8:28,629
they also say quote


182
0:8:28,629 --> 0:8:31,389
passionate failed to do so mean need all
the requirements


183
0:8:31,389 --> 0:8:35,229
the n_r_a_ will make an exception to our
center policy of not scoring


184
0:8:35,229 --> 0:8:36,91
procedural votes


185
0:8:36,91 --> 0:8:41,139
as strongly oppose a cloture motion to
moved to file past univ


186
0:8:41,139 --> 0:8:43,16
of at six four nine


187
0:8:43,16 --> 0:8:47,37
now what know were they throw cloture
motion as six for and what it was a


188
0:8:47,37 --> 0:8:50,38
they're saying


189
0:8:50,38 --> 0:8:53,51
you get a final vote on this bill begin
filibuster the meaning the oil spill


190
0:8:53,51 --> 0:8:54,84
must repent


191
0:8:54,84 --> 0:8:57,73
this eight if you don't filibuster


192
0:8:57,73 --> 0:9:1,1
you know one of those extraordinary step
of filibustering this


193
0:9:1,1 --> 0:9:3,34
even though we don't know lingering
filibusters


194
0:9:3,34 --> 0:9:4,82
regrading this one


195
0:9:4,82 --> 0:9:6,73
and a marketing guess your record


196
0:9:6,73 --> 0:9:9,44
and then run ads against


197
0:9:9,44 --> 0:9:11,269
even though they got almost


198
0:9:11,269 --> 0:9:13,26
everything they wanted


199
0:9:13,26 --> 0:9:16,0
president obama me in his nature


200
0:9:16,0 --> 0:9:19,77
total an under cravin weakness susan
