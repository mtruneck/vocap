0:0:0,13 --> 0:0:2,939
daily news is it good article it's uh...


2
0:0:2,939 --> 0:0:6,87
about map like dot world research into
how much


3
0:0:6,87 --> 0:0:9,189
winning s_s_c_ in a congressional seat


4
0:0:9,189 --> 0:0:11,159
costing twenty twelve


5
0:0:11,159 --> 0:0:13,289
way to you lose it


6
0:0:13,289 --> 0:0:14,529
the u_s_ senate


7
0:0:14,529 --> 0:0:17,81
average winning race cost ten million


8
0:0:17,81 --> 0:0:20,99
four hundred seventy six thousand


9
0:0:20,99 --> 0:0:22,409
four hundred and fifty one


10
0:0:22,409 --> 0:0:25,939
so yet and a half million dollars well
you know what a satirist


11
0:0:25,939 --> 0:0:30,76
if you don't have ten million dollars
good luck to you about it


12
0:0:30,76 --> 0:0:33,289
do we really have a marketing careful
armor


13
0:0:33,289 --> 0:0:35,75
you know are metaphor


14
0:0:35,75 --> 0:0:38,77
the t_b_ then become a senator


15
0:0:38,77 --> 0:0:44,91
of course that it is a local farmer kato
global poverty ocap even dentist do it


16
0:0:44,91 --> 0:0:49,23
no the only way you can do is you're
you're incredibly rich


17
0:0:49,23 --> 0:0:50,18
or


18
0:0:50,18 --> 0:0:52,5
you will in the sucked up to people


19
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:54,48
or corporations were incredibly rich


20
0:0:54,48 --> 0:0:55,47
of course


21
0:0:55,47 --> 0:0:58,83
well out of the house i mean that's
probably a portable right


22
0:0:58,83 --> 0:1:2,48
winning race one million six hundred
eighty nine thousand five hundred and


23
0:1:2,48 --> 0:1:3,44
eighty dollars


24
0:1:3,44 --> 0:1:6,37
who's up on average the candidates who
won


25
0:1:6,37 --> 0:1:8,2
raise that much money


26
0:1:8,2 --> 0:1:10,7
now where they got to get that money of
course they're gonna get it for


27
0:1:10,7 --> 0:1:12,2
multinational corporations


28
0:1:12,2 --> 0:1:13,49
who become then


29
0:1:13,49 --> 0:1:15,98
the master of the house


30
0:1:15,98 --> 0:1:16,859
and by the way


31
0:1:16,859 --> 0:1:21,49
every if you work your atw he might be
able to raise a from small donors


32
0:1:21,49 --> 0:1:23,83
but what do you think i a sinner centers
in india


33
0:1:23,83 --> 0:1:25,7
made a hundred calls


34
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:27,71
try to get a hundred dollars at a time


35
0:1:27,71 --> 0:1:31,88
really gonna make one call to a giant
corporation is a


36
0:1:31,88 --> 0:1:33,43
help a brother out


37
0:1:33,43 --> 0:1:35,23
and you'll get it in return


38
0:1:35,23 --> 0:1:37,2
that's exactly what they're gonna do


39
0:1:37,2 --> 0:1:40,95
about already had that system citizen
and have a report on steroids


40
0:1:40,95 --> 0:1:42,75
but back in two thousand eight


41
0:1:42,75 --> 0:1:46,809
leverage joining as senate seat was nine
million to within one thousand


42
0:1:46,809 --> 0:1:50,129
my house was one million ford in seventy
one thousand so yes is doubly getting


43
0:1:50,129 --> 0:1:51,73
worse right


44
0:1:51,73 --> 0:1:55,24
but those are joint numbers to begin
with now to give you a sense again going


45
0:1:55,24 --> 0:1:57,9
back to twenty twelve numbers


46
0:1:57,9 --> 0:2:0,42
how much money they would have to raise


47
0:2:0,42 --> 0:2:3,34
every single day in two years


48
0:2:3,34 --> 0:2:7,36
to get to be able to get reelected if
they were ready congress for example


49
0:2:7,36 --> 0:2:9,809
in the senate they would have to raise


50
0:2:9,809 --> 0:2:13,559
fourteen thousand three hundred and
fifty one dollars


51
0:2:13,559 --> 0:2:16,539
every single day for two years


52
0:2:16,539 --> 0:2:18,229
now the congressional seats


53
0:2:18,229 --> 0:2:21,649
there are only four two years they lasts
only two years


54
0:2:21,649 --> 0:2:25,89
and every day of those two years yet
there is two thousand three hundred and


55
0:2:25,89 --> 0:2:26,23
fifteen dollars


56
0:2:26,23 --> 0:2:27,849
to be able to win


57
0:2:27,849 --> 0:2:32,439
so it's no wonder that they spend
literally a majority of their time fifty


58
0:2:32,439 --> 0:2:34,43
to seventy percent of their time


59
0:2:34,43 --> 0:2:35,819
raising money


60
0:2:35,819 --> 0:2:39,529
not legislating not giving again about
their constituents not meeting with


61
0:2:39,529 --> 0:2:40,559
their constituents


62
0:2:40,559 --> 0:2:42,83
not writing bills not doing research


63
0:2:42,83 --> 0:2:47,329
but raising money because that's the
only thing that gives them elected


64
0:2:47,329 --> 0:2:49,869
this system is literally sick


65
0:2:49,869 --> 0:2:51,87
this corrupted to which cor


66
0:2:51,87 --> 0:2:53,29
it's not a democracy


67
0:2:53,29 --> 0:2:55,489
is by the rates for the rich


68
0:2:55,489 --> 0:2:58,49
and certainly all of the rich


69
0:2:58,49 --> 0:3:1,219
now we got to change the system entirely


70
0:3:1,219 --> 0:3:5,519
obviously you know but i think wolf bags
the way to do that walt bash pack dot


71
0:3:5,519 --> 0:3:6,25
com


72
0:3:6,25 --> 0:3:9,39
and we do is to push for a
constitutional amendment


73
0:3:9,39 --> 0:3:13,28
that takes away corporate person heard
so they can spend unlimited money


74
0:3:13,28 --> 0:3:16,3
buying our politicians to legalized
bribery


75
0:3:16,3 --> 0:3:18,669
that's exactly what this is


76
0:3:18,669 --> 0:3:19,91
and you actually


77
0:3:19,91 --> 0:3:24,84
do funding of elections publicly so
there are the go begging for cash so we


78
0:3:24,84 --> 0:3:27,559
write their checks and they work for ops


79
0:3:27,559 --> 0:3:30,569
not for the big donors


80
0:3:30,569 --> 0:3:33,129
one more thing that's really important


81
0:3:33,129 --> 0:3:35,569
ralph nader uh... was


82
0:3:35,569 --> 0:3:37,469
gore and uh... different


83
0:3:37,469 --> 0:3:39,629
democrats and ask him hey listen


84
0:3:39,629 --> 0:3:42,589
why aren't you guys running tougher
campaigns


85
0:3:42,589 --> 0:3:45,82
the republican party is an historic
popularity


86
0:3:45,82 --> 0:3:48,799
lolz they were before the twenty twelve
election


87
0:3:48,799 --> 0:3:49,849
you gotta run


88
0:3:49,849 --> 0:3:52,73
halfway populist campaigns in you wanted


89
0:3:52,73 --> 0:3:54,69
reich step


90
0:3:54,69 --> 0:3:57,669
why did you do that why did you win the
house now of course a robot mo one they


91
0:3:57,669 --> 0:3:59,399
won the senate


92
0:3:59,399 --> 0:4:2,359
then biggest plan was to win twelve
house-senate


93
0:4:2,359 --> 0:4:4,639
the answer twelve house seats back


94
0:4:4,639 --> 0:4:7,269
what that would know when the house back
for them so they didn't even planning


95
0:4:7,269 --> 0:4:8,619
with the house back


96
0:4:8,619 --> 0:4:10,8
senator asked them


97
0:4:10,8 --> 0:4:13,7
and of course a lot of them he says
given answers like well we had


98
0:4:13,7 --> 0:4:14,889
gerrymandered districts


99
0:4:14,889 --> 0:4:16,4
and uh...


100
0:4:16,4 --> 0:4:20,15
you know there was big money support for
public as that's true decision are


101
0:4:20,15 --> 0:4:21,15
gerrymandered


102
0:4:21,15 --> 0:4:23,129
panorama is you have a ton of money


103
0:4:23,129 --> 0:4:25,229
but one high ranking democrat


104
0:4:25,229 --> 0:4:26,49
even the answer


105
0:4:26,49 --> 0:4:29,76
that is the most roofing and i have ever
seen in politics


106
0:4:29,76 --> 0:4:32,409
he told him quote


107
0:4:32,409 --> 0:4:37,27
because we graze less money


108
0:4:37,27 --> 0:4:40,33
the reason the democrats


109
0:4:40,33 --> 0:4:43,24
run tough campaigns


110
0:4:43,24 --> 0:4:46,849
even more progressive campaigns against
republicans


111
0:4:46,849 --> 0:4:50,21
is because they would then anger their
corporate bosses


112
0:4:50,21 --> 0:4:52,11
indeed results money


113
0:4:52,11 --> 0:4:55,539
so if they were to tell the american
people look at these corrupt republicans


114
0:4:55,539 --> 0:4:57,36
let me know they're taken money from


115
0:4:57,36 --> 0:5:1,669
mother who'd been doing favors from the
they're working for the lobbyist in the


116
0:5:1,669 --> 0:5:3,58
special emphasis at our


117
0:5:3,58 --> 0:5:6,559
than those same one is a special
interests and say how beer you know


118
0:5:6,559 --> 0:5:7,97
we're taking away your money


119
0:5:7,97 --> 0:5:11,439
and then you have no chance of winning


120
0:5:11,439 --> 0:5:13,659
you see that right there


121
0:5:13,659 --> 0:5:20,539
it's not democrats versus republicans as
democrats and republicans verses us


122
0:5:20,539 --> 0:5:22,909
they can really go out for the
republicans


123
0:5:22,909 --> 0:5:24,3
why


124
0:5:24,3 --> 0:5:26,8
because then they'd raise less money


125
0:5:26,8 --> 0:5:29,479
from the donors their all be holding two


126
0:5:29,479 --> 0:5:31,65
wall that packed up from


127
0:5:31,65 --> 0:5:33,509
become a member


128
0:5:33,509 --> 0:5:37,69
contribute volunteer do whatever you
gotta do but we got it is a system


129
0:5:37,69 --> 0:7:37,69
position result was not a democracy
