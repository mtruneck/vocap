1
0:0:2,51 --> 0:0:4,97
PROFESSOR: OKAY, SO I HOPE YOU ALL DID WELL
ON THE EXAM, AND


2
0:0:4,97 --> 0:0:8,62
IT'S GOOD TO BE ABLE TO JUST FOCUS ON ONE
PART OF THE COURSE FROM


3
0:0:8,62 --> 0:0:13,6
NOW ON. I KNOW YOU'VE ALL MET WITH YOUR LAB
AT LEAST ONCE OR


4
0:0:13,6 --> 0:0:17,41
ONCE NOW WITH REGARD TO THE BOTANY PART OF
COURSE AND SEEN SOME


5
0:0:17,41 --> 0:0:20,56
OF THE ORGANISMS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK
ABOUT TODAY AND JUST


6
0:0:20,56 --> 0:0:24,21
MENTIONED BRIEFLY LAST TIME AS WELL AS SOME
WE TALKED ABOUT


7
0:0:24,21 --> 0:0:29,9
EARLIER. AND THIS WEEK YOU'RE GOING TO FOCUS
MORE ON VASCULAR


8
0:0:29,9 --> 0:0:31,77
PLANTS, GET INTO THE VASCULAR PLANTS, WHICH
WE'LL START TO TALK


9
0:0:31,77 --> 0:0:39,64
ABOUT IN TODAY'S LAB OR TODAY'S LECTURE. SO
FIRST OFF I'M GOING


10
0:0:39,64 --> 0:0:43,35
TO REVIEW JUST A BIT ABOUT LAND PLANTS, SOME
OF THE THINGS I HAD


11
0:0:43,35 --> 0:0:46,719
TO SAY AT THE LAST, AT THE END OF LAST LECTURE
SO WE'RE ALL ON


12
0:0:46,719 --> 0:0:50,17
THE SAME PAGE HERE NOW THAT YOU CAN FOCUS
JUST ON THIS PART OF


13
0:0:50,17 --> 0:0:54,19
THE COURSE. AND THEN WE'LL EVENTUALLY GET
INTO INTRODUCING


14
0:0:54,19 --> 0:0:57,639
VASCULAR PLANTS TODAY WHICH ARE THE PLANTS
THAT WE'RE PROBABLY


15
0:0:57,639 --> 0:1:2,459
MOST FAMILIAR WITH. BUT FIRST I JUST WANT
TO BRIEFLY RECAP LIFE


16
0:1:2,459 --> 0:1:5,6
CYCLES BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
TYPES OF LIFE


17
0:1:5,6 --> 0:1:10,72
CYCLES IN THE LAST WEEK AND A HALF OR SO.
AND FROM NOW ON WE'RE


18
0:1:10,72 --> 0:1:14,11
JUST GOING TO BE LOOKING AT LAND PLANTS. SO
IT'S IMPORTANT TO


19
0:1:14,11 --> 0:1:17,0
NOT TO GET THEIR LIFE CYCLE CONFUSED WITH
SOME OF THE ONES WE


20
0:1:17,0 --> 0:1:22,4
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. OKAY, SO FIRST OF ALL,
OF COURSE HUMANS


21
0:1:22,4 --> 0:1:29,77
AND ALSO DIATOMS, AMONGST SOME OTHER ALGAE
WE DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT,


22
0:1:29,77 --> 0:1:33,34
HAVE A LIFE CYCLE WHERE WE JUST HAVE ONE MULTICELLULAR


23
0:1:33,34 --> 0:1:37,52
GENERATION, A DIPLOID GENERATION, YOU KNOW,
YOU AND ME. AND THE


24
0:1:37,52 --> 0:1:42,1
ONLY HAPLOID STAGE THEN IS THE GAMETE. SO
THERE'S NO


25
0:1:42,1 --> 0:1:42,1



26
0:1:42,1 --> 0:1:50,39
MULTICELLULAR HAPLOID GENERATION. THE FUNGI
AND ACTUALLY ALSO


27
0:1:50,39 --> 0:1:55,23
THE CLOSEST RELATIVES OF THE LAND PLANTS HAVE
A ZYGOTIC LIFE


28
0:1:55,23 --> 0:2:0,35
CYCLE WHERE THE ONLY DIPLOID STAGE IS THE
ZYGOTE. AND THE ONLY


29
0:2:0,35 --> 0:2:6,17
MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM IN THAT LIFE CYCLE
HAS HAPLOID NUCLEI.


30
0:2:6,17 --> 0:2:12,159
AND OF COURSE IN THE CASE OF FUNGI, THERE
ARE ALSO SOME FUNGAL


31
0:2:12,159 --> 0:2:15,87
GROUPS, THE MAJORITY OF THE DIVERSITY IN THE
FUNGI THAT HAVE THIS


32
0:2:15,87 --> 0:2:19,3
DIKARYOTIC STAGE. BUT WE WON'T BE SEEING THAT
AGAIN. THAT'S


33
0:2:19,3 --> 0:2:22,87
EXCLUSIVELY FOUND SOME OF THE HIGHER FUNG-,
IN THE HIGHER FUNGI,


34
0:2:22,87 --> 0:2:26,95
LIKE THE ASCOMYCOTA, BASIDIOMYCOTA, THOSE
TWO GROUPS, WHERE WE


35
0:2:26,95 --> 0:2:31,18
HAD TWO HAPLOID NUCLEI IN THE SAME CELLULAR
PARTITION. SO


36
0:2:31,18 --> 0:2:35,519
THAT'S SORT OF AN ANOMALY FOR THE FUNGI. AND
WE WON'T BE SEEING


37
0:2:35,519 --> 0:2:41,219
THAT ANY LONGER. NOW IN ALL THE LAND PLANTS
 -- AND I ALSO


38
0:2:41,219 --> 0:2:46,18
MENTIONED IN THE SEA LETTUCE, THE ULVA, ONE
OF THE GREEN ALGAE,


39
0:2:46,18 --> 0:2:49,639
WHICH HAS INDEPENDENTLY EVOLVED THIS LIFE
CYCLE FROM THE LAND


40
0:2:49,639 --> 0:2:53,79
PLANTS -- WE HAVE MULTICELLULAR GENERATIONS
THAT ARE BOTH DIPLOID


41
0:2:53,79 --> 0:2:58,4
AND HAPLOID. SO WE HAVE THIS ALTERNATION OF
GENERATIONS BETWEEN


42
0:2:58,4 --> 0:3:4,81
DIPLOID AND HAPLOID MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS
OF SAME SPECIES.


43
0:3:4,81 --> 0:3:8,849
AND SO JUST TO RECAP IT HERE IN IT'S, IN THE
ACTUAL CYCLE FORMAT


44
0:3:8,849 --> 0:3:13,87
HERE YOU CAN SEE A MULTICELLULAR HAPLOID ORGANISM
WHICH WE CALL


45
0:3:13,87 --> 0:3:18,93
THE GAMETE PRODUCING PLANT OR THE GAMETOPHYTE.
SO THE HAPLOID


46
0:3:18,93 --> 0:3:22,98
GENERATION PRODUCES THE GAMETES, OKAY, BY
MITOSIS BECAUSE THEY'RE


47
0:3:22,98 --> 0:3:29,29
ALREADY HAPLOID. THE GAMETES THEN FUSE TOGETHER
TO FORM THE


48
0:3:29,29 --> 0:3:34,84
ZYGOTE. AND THEN WE HAVE MITOSES THAT FORM
A MULTICELLULAR


49
0:3:34,84 --> 0:3:38,379
DIPLOID ORGANISM. REMEMBER THE ZYGOTE'S DIPLOID
OBVIOUSLY. WE


50
0:3:38,379 --> 0:3:42,279
HAD A MULTICELLULAR DIPLOID ORGANISM THAT'S
ALWAYS CALLED THE


51
0:3:42,279 --> 0:3:42,279



52
0:3:42,279 --> 0:3:46,139
SPOROPHYTE, WHICH IS THE SPORE-PRODUCING PLANT.
PHYTE JUST MEANS


53
0:3:46,139 --> 0:3:52,299
PLANT. AND THEN WE HAVE MEIOSIS OCCURING TO
PRODUCE SPORES, SO


54
0:3:52,299 --> 0:3:56,359
WE GO FROM DIPLOID TO HAPLOID HERE IN MEIOSIS.
AND THEN MITOSES


55
0:3:56,359 --> 0:3:59,629
TO GIVE US ANOTHER MULTICELLULAR HAPLOID ORGANISM.
SO IT JUST


56
0:3:59,629 --> 0:4:3,349
GOES BACK AND FORTH OR IT GOES AROUND AND
AROUND HERE BETWEEN THE


57
0:4:3,349 --> 0:4:8,48
DIPOLID AND THE HAPLOID ORGANISMS. AND THE
STRUCTURES WHERE THE


58
0:4:8,48 --> 0:4:12,939
GAMETES ARE BORN ON THE GAMETOPHYTE ARE CALLED
GAMETANGIA.


59
0:4:12,939 --> 0:4:16,73
THOSE ARE JUST HOLLOW SAC-LIKE, SAC-SHAPED
STRUCTURES THAT BEAR


60
0:4:16,73 --> 0:4:21,98
GAMETES. AND SIMILARLY IN THE SPOROPHYTE THE
STRUCTURE THAT


61
0:4:21,98 --> 0:4:27,76
BEARS THE SPORES WHERE MEIOSIS OCCURS IS CALLED
THE SPORANGIUM.


62
0:4:27,76 --> 0:4:32,57
SO THOSE ARE REALLY SIMPLE CLEAR STEPS. AND
THEY'RE CONSISTENT


63
0:4:32,57 --> 0:4:36,29
THROUGHOUT THE LAND PLANTS. BUT THERE'S ELABORATION
IN THESE


64
0:4:36,29 --> 0:4:41,47
THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO, YOU NEED TO HAVE
THIS DOWN IN TERMS OF


65
0:4:41,47 --> 0:4:46,17
THE MAIN STEPS IN THIS ALTERNATION BETWEEN
THESE STEPS TO REALLY


66
0:4:46,17 --> 0:4:50,27
UNDERSTAND THESE SUBSEQUENT LIFE CYCLES. SO
PLEASE AS I


67
0:4:50,27 --> 0:4:52,97
MENTIONED EARLIER, TRY TO EMBRACE THIS AND
MEMORIZE IT AS SOON AS


68
0:4:52,97 --> 0:4:59,95
POSSIBLE AND IT'LL HELP YOU A LOT. OKAY SO
NOW WE ALREADY


69
0:4:59,95 --> 0:5:4,59
TALKED ABOUT HOW THE, THE LAND PLANTS ARE
A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP.


70
0:5:4,59 --> 0:5:7,63
SO THE LAND PLANTS APPEAR TO HAVE EVOLVED
FROM, ALL THE MODERN


71
0:5:7,63 --> 0:5:11,6
LAND PLANTS AND SOME LAND PLANTS THAT HAVE
ACTUALLY GONE BACK TO


72
0:5:11,6 --> 0:5:14,19
AQUATIC SITUATIONS OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL,
THOSE ARE A


73
0:5:14,19 --> 0:5:19,69
MONOPHYLETIC GROUP THAT DESCEND FROM PART
OF THE GREEN ALGAE.


74
0:5:19,69 --> 0:5:23,9
SO THE ORGANISMS WE WERE CALLING GREEN ALGAE
EARLIER ARE ACTUALLY


75
0:5:23,9 --> 0:5:29,54
PARAPHYLETIC, THAT IS SOME GREEN ALGAE ARE
MORE CLOSELY RELATED


76
0:5:29,54 --> 0:5:32,81
TO LAND PLANTS THAN THEY ARE TO THE OTHER
GREEN ALGAE. SO THESE


77
0:5:32,81 --> 0:5:32,81



78
0:5:32,81 --> 0:5:37,72
ARE THE BASE OF TREE HERE. THESE ARE THE ANCESTRAL,
THE


79
0:5:37,72 --> 0:5:42,59
ANCESTORS OF THIS GROUP AND THE TIPS HERE,
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT


80
0:5:42,59 --> 0:5:47,53
THE, THE MOST RECENT COMMON ANCESTOR HERE
OF ALL THE GREEN ALGAE


81
0:5:47,53 --> 0:5:53,5
IS ALSO SHARED WITH THE LAND PLANTS. SO THE
TERM GREEN PLANT


82
0:5:53,5 --> 0:5:57,59
HAS COME TO BE USED FOR ALL OF THE GREEN ORGANISMS,
INCLUDING THE


83
0:5:57,59 --> 0:6:1,9
LAND PLANTS SINCE WE KNOW NOW THAT THE GREEN
ALGAE DON'T


84
0:6:1,9 --> 0:6:6,61
CONSTITUTE A NATURAL GROUP WITHOUT INCLUDING
THE LAND PLANTS.


85
0:6:6,61 --> 0:6:9,62
OKAY, AND SO THE CLOSEST RELATIVES OF THE
LAND PLANTS ARE


86
0:6:9,62 --> 0:6:14,38
FRESHWATER GREEN ALGAE, NOT SALTWATER GREEN
ALGAE. SO THE


87
0:6:14,38 --> 0:6:19,25
COLONIZATION OF LAND HAPPENED NOT DIRECTLY
FROM THE OCEAN OR FROM


88
0:6:19,25 --> 0:6:23,42
MARINE SITUATIONS TO LAND BUT WITH AN INTERMEDIARY
STEP INTO


89
0:6:23,42 --> 0:6:27,72
FRESHWATER BEFORE COLONIZATION OF LAND. SO
THAT'S, THAT'S


90
0:6:27,72 --> 0:6:31,86
SOMETHING THAT'S BECOME WELL-RECOGNIZED NOW
WITH A LOT OF RECENT


91
0:6:31,86 --> 0:6:41,76
EVIDENCE, BOTH MORPHOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR.
OKAY. THOUGH THESE


92
0:6:41,76 --> 0:6:45,73
ARE THE SEVEN MAJOR GROUPS OF LAND PLANTS
THAT WE'RE GOING TO


93
0:6:45,73 --> 0:6:48,7
FOCUS ON IN THIS COURSE. THERE ARE OTHERS
BUT THESE ARE THE


94
0:6:48,7 --> 0:6:53,79
SEVEN MAJOR LINEAGES OR CLADES. AND HERE'S
THE MOST RECENT


95
0:6:53,79 --> 0:6:59,11
COMMON ANCESTOR OF ALL OF THE, THE LAND PLANTS
NOW EXTINCT. AND


96
0:6:59,11 --> 0:7:3,23
YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS, BASED ON MOLECULAR
AND FOSSIL DATA, WE


97
0:7:3,23 --> 0:7:9,88
THINK THIS IS BACK IN THE EARLY PALEOZOIC,
SO RIGHT AROUND THE


98
0:7:9,88 --> 0:7:14,8
TIME WE HAVE A LOT OF MULTICELLULAR LIFE EVOLVING.
WE HAVE THE


99
0:7:14,8 --> 0:7:20,15
LAND PLANTS EVOLVING. AND THEN ABOUT 50 MILLION
YEARS LATER WE


100
0:7:20,15 --> 0:7:24,19
GET THE ORIGIN OF THE VASCULAR PLANTS WHICH
ARE THESE FOUR MAJOR


101
0:7:24,19 --> 0:7:27,9
LINEAGES THAT I'LL GET TO IN A MOMENT. BUT
THESE ARE THE ONES


102
0:7:27,9 --> 0:7:30,659
THAT HAVE RIGID CONDUCTING TISSUES, AND THEY'RE
SPOROPHYTES THAT


103
0:7:30,659 --> 0:7:30,66



104
0:7:30,66 --> 0:7:36,24
ALLOWS THEM TO GET TO VERY LARGE SIZES AND
HAVE BRANCHING,


105
0:7:36,24 --> 0:7:39,2
BRANCHING GROWTH FOR THE SPOROPHYTE. SO THE
GROUPS LIKE THE


106
0:7:39,2 --> 0:7:43,39
SEED PLANTS, THE FERNS AND RELATIVES AND THE
LYCOPHYTES THAT I'LL


107
0:7:43,39 --> 0:7:46,59
MENTION WHICH HAVE OFTEN BEEN CALLED FERN
ALLIES, THESE ARE ALL


108
0:7:46,59 --> 0:7:50,42
THE VASCULAR PLANTS THAT HAVE THE MAJOR CONDUCTING
TISSUE. THEY


109
0:7:50,42 --> 0:7:54,37
HAVE ROOTS. THEY HAVE A LOT OF FEATURES THAT,
THICK CUTICLES OR


110
0:7:54,37 --> 0:7:59,2
WAXY COVERING ON THEIR PLANT BODY THAT ALLOWS
THEM TO WITHSTAND


111
0:7:59,2 --> 0:8:2,36
DROUGHT. SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF FEATURES THAT
MAKE THEM WELL


112
0:8:2,36 --> 0:8:6,58
ADAPTED TO LAND. YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE
THESE OTHER THREE


113
0:8:6,58 --> 0:8:11,24
GROUPS HERE, THE MOSSES, THE HORNWORTS, AND
THE LIVERWORTS THAT I


114
0:8:11,24 --> 0:8:15,45
STARTED TO INTRODUCE LAST TIME WHICH ARE NOT
A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP


115
0:8:15,45 --> 0:8:22,92
BY A BASAL GRADE HERE WITHIN THE LAND PLANTS.
SO YOU CAN SEE


116
0:8:22,92 --> 0:8:26,889
HOW THEY BRANCH OFF IN A SEQUENTIAL FASHION
HERE. THEY DON'T,


117
0:8:26,889 --> 0:8:30,24
THE MOST RECENT COMMON ANCESTOR OF ALL THE
BRYOPHYTES IS ALSO


118
0:8:30,24 --> 0:8:34,89
SHARED WITH THE VASCULAR PLANTS. AND THE VASCULAR
PLANTS ARE


119
0:8:34,89 --> 0:8:39,59
MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO SOME BRYOPHYTES THAN
TO OTHERS. AND THE


120
0:8:39,59 --> 0:8:41,3
INTERESTING THING HERE IS THE BRYOPHYTES HAVE
LONG BEEN


121
0:8:41,3 --> 0:8:46,65
CONSIDERED A NATURAL GROUP BUT IN FACT THEY'RE
ACTUALLY A GRADE,


122
0:8:46,65 --> 0:8:50,529
A PARAPHYLETIC GROUP. SO THE FEATURES THAT
THEY SHARE IN COMMON


123
0:8:50,529 --> 0:8:53,8
THAT LEAD TO THEM BEING CALLED A GROUP OF
PLANTS, THE BRYOPHYTES,


124
0:8:53,8 --> 0:8:59,62
GIVEN THAT THEY'RE PARAPHYLETIC, WE'D INFER
THAT THOSE FEATURES


125
0:8:59,62 --> 0:9:2,39
WERE FOUND IN THE COMMON ANCESTOR OF ALL THE
LAND PLANTS,


126
0:9:2,39 --> 0:9:7,71
INCLUDING THE VASCULAR PLANTS, OKAY. SO UNDERSTANDING
OF


127
0:9:7,71 --> 0:9:11,92
BRYOPHYTES REALLY ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND
THE ANCESTOR OF ALL THE


128
0:9:11,92 --> 0:9:16,959
LAND PLANTS, THE MOST RECENT COMMON ANCESTOR.
SO THAT'S A REALLY


129
0:9:16,959 --> 0:9:16,96



130
0:9:16,96 --> 0:9:19,44
IMPORTANT FINDING. AND THIS WAS DISCOVERED
BACK IN THE 1980S,


131
0:9:19,44 --> 0:9:23,48
BASED ON MORPHOLOGY. ACTUALLY BRENT MISHLER
IS ONE OF THE


132
0:9:23,48 --> 0:9:26,45
FACULTY IN IB, MADE THAT DISCOVERY INITIALLY,
AND IT'S BEEN


133
0:9:26,45 --> 0:9:30,48
REINFORCED WITH MOLECULAR DATA. THE PRECISE
BRANCHING ORDER OF


134
0:9:30,48 --> 0:9:35,0
THESE THREE MAJOR GROUPS IS A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR
STILL, BUT IT'S


135
0:9:35,0 --> 0:9:39,6
PRETTY CLEAR THAT THEY ARE PARAPHYLETIC AND
THAT THE LIVERWORTS


136
0:9:39,6 --> 0:9:42,82
SHOWN HERE ARE THE EARLIEST LINEAGE TO BRANCH
OFF AND ARE SISTER


137
0:9:42,82 --> 0:9:48,44
TO ALL THE OTHER LAND PLANTS. SO ARE THERE
ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT


138
0:9:48,44 --> 0:9:56,6
THAT? OKAY. SO ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN WE LOOK
TO THE


139
0:9:56,6 --> 0:9:59,56
BRYOPHYTES THAT YOU SEE RIGHT AWAY IS THEY
HAVE SOME INTERESTING


140
0:9:59,56 --> 0:10:2,98
FEATURES THAT MAKE THEM PRETTY WELL ADAPTED
TO LAND. I MEAN


141
0:10:2,98 --> 0:10:5,44
THEY'RE A VERY SUCCESSFUL GROUP. YOU FIND
THEM ON ALL THE


142
0:10:5,44 --> 0:10:9,92
CONTINENTS. AND THEY OCCUR IN A WIDE VARIETY
OF HABITATS,


143
0:10:9,92 --> 0:10:15,8
TEMPERATE AND TROPICAL. ONE THING YOU SEE
IS THAT THEIR SPORES


144
0:10:15,8 --> 0:10:17,98
ARE RESISTANT TO DESICCATION TO SOME EXTENT,
THAT IS THEY DON'T


145
0:10:17,98 --> 0:10:22,27
DRY OUT READILY. SO THEY CAN DISPERSE SPORES
AND THE SPORES CAN


146
0:10:22,27 --> 0:10:26,83
TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES AND WITHSTAND SOME ENVIRONMENTAL
EXTREMES.


147
0:10:26,83 --> 0:10:29,589
BUT ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS ABOUT THE BRYOPHYTES
AND SOMETHING


148
0:10:29,589 --> 0:10:33,75
THAT'S ONLY BECOME REALLY APPRECIATED IN THE
LAST FEW YEARS,


149
0:10:33,75 --> 0:10:36,8
WELL, IT'S BEEN KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME BUT
IT'S BEEN STUDIED MORE


150
0:10:36,8 --> 0:10:41,31
INTENSIVELY, IS THAT EVEN THEIR MAIN BODY,
THEIR, THE MAIN PLANT


151
0:10:41,31 --> 0:10:45,45
BODY, THE GAMETOPHYTE IN THIS CASE -- WE'LL
GET TO THE LIFE CYCLE


152
0:10:45,45 --> 0:10:52,38
IN A MOMENT -- IS DESICCATION TOLERANT. AND
SO NOT ONLY CAN THE


153
0:10:52,38 --> 0:10:56,89
SPORES WITHSTAND DESICCATION BUT THE ACTUAL
VEGETATIVE BODY OF


154
0:10:56,89 --> 0:11:1,13
THE PLANT CAN DRY OUT ESSENTIALLY COMPLETELY
AND THE BRYOPHYTES


155
0:11:1,13 --> 0:11:1,19



156
0:11:1,19 --> 0:11:5,63
THAT AT LEAST OCCUR IN SEASONALLY DRY ENVIRONMENTS
OR PERENNIALLY


157
0:11:5,63 --> 0:11:9,44
PRETTY DRY ENVIRONMENTS. AND THEY LOOK FOR
ALL PRACTICAL


158
0:11:9,44 --> 0:11:12,44
PURPOSES TO BE LIFELESS WHEN THEY'RE IN THAT
STATE. YOU CAN'T


159
0:11:12,44 --> 0:11:16,42
DETECT ANY METABOLIC ACTIVITY. BUT ALL YOU
HAVE TO DO IS ADD


160
0:11:16,42 --> 0:11:22,23
WATER AND THEY'RE RIGHT BACK, THEY REHYDRATE
VERY, VERY QUICKLY.


161
0:11:22,23 --> 0:11:27,0
AND THEY'RE PHOTOSYNTHESIZING AGAIN IN NO
TIME. SO THIS IS


162
0:11:27,0 --> 0:11:30,38
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN REALLY INTERESTING.
AND A LOT OF CROP


163
0:11:30,38 --> 0:11:33,62
SCIENTISTS, FOR EXAMPLE, REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND
THIS AND SEE


164
0:11:33,62 --> 0:11:37,47
IF THEY CAN GET GENES FROM BRYOPHYTES INTO
CROPS BECAUSE THE


165
0:11:37,47 --> 0:11:41,64
VASCULAR PLANTS, AS SUCCESSFUL AS THEY'VE
BEEN ON LAND, MOSTLY


166
0:11:41,64 --> 0:11:44,64
DON'T HAVE THIS CAPABILITY. THEY HAVE A LOT
OF WAYS OF


167
0:11:44,64 --> 0:11:47,81
PREVENTING THEMSELVES FROM DRYING OUT. YOU
KNOW THEY HAVE GREAT


168
0:11:47,81 --> 0:11:51,86
CONDUCTING TISSUE AND ROOT SYSTEMS, THICK
CUTICLES, THESE WAXY


169
0:11:51,86 --> 0:11:56,17
COVERINGS, BUT ONCE THEY ACTUALLY DO DRY OUT,
MOST OF THEM ARE


170
0:11:56,17 --> 0:11:59,86
TOAST. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO REVIVE. THERE
ARE SOME THAT WILL,


171
0:11:59,86 --> 0:12:3,36
AND I'LL SHOW YOU A COUPLE. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT THE


172
0:12:3,36 --> 0:12:7,14
BRYOPHYTES HAVE DOWN. THEY DON'T HAVE ROOT
SYSTEMS. THEY DON'T


173
0:12:7,14 --> 0:12:10,339
HAVE, YOU KNOW, DESICCATION RESISTANT LEAVES,
BUT THEY SURVIVE


174
0:12:10,339 --> 0:12:16,91
DESICCATION OR DRYING OUT REALLY WELL. OKAY,
SO THE LIFE CYCLE


175
0:12:16,91 --> 0:12:24,39
OF BRYOPHYTES IS INTERESTING. AND REMEMBER
THAT THE CLOSEST


176
0:12:24,39 --> 0:12:28,48
RELATIVES OF THE LAND PLANTS ARE ALGAE THAT
DIDN'T HAVE AN


177
0:12:28,48 --> 0:12:33,79
ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS. THEY JUST HAD
A HAPLOID ORGANISM


178
0:12:33,79 --> 0:12:38,0
AND THE ONLY DIPLOID STAGE WAS THE ZYGOTE.
NOW WHAT YOU SEE IN


179
0:12:38,0 --> 0:12:42,37
THE BRYOPHYTES AND PRESUMABLY THE ANCESTOR
OF ALL THE MODERN LAND


180
0:12:42,37 --> 0:12:47,61
PLANTS IS THAT THE DOMINANT GENERATION IS
THE GAMETOPHYTE, THE


181
0:12:47,61 --> 0:12:47,61



182
0:12:47,61 --> 0:12:51,27
HAPLOID GENERATION, WHICH MAKES A LOT OF SENSE
CONSIDERING THAT


183
0:12:51,27 --> 0:12:55,19
THEIR CLOSEST RELATIVES ONLY HAD A HAPLOID
GENERATION. THESE


184
0:12:55,19 --> 0:12:59,87
HAVE A DOMINANT HAPLOID GENERATION. AND THE
SPOROPHYTE


185
0:12:59,87 --> 0:13:2,98
GENERATION WHICH IS SHOWN HERE IN THIS PINK
PART OF THE LIFE


186
0:13:2,98 --> 0:13:7,66
CYCLE IS A PARASITE ON THE GAMETOPHYTE, ON
THE MATERNAL


187
0:13:7,66 --> 0:13:12,49
GAMETOPHYTE. SO THE SPOROPHYTE IS AN EXTREMELY
SMALL AND


188
0:13:12,49 --> 0:13:17,0
EPHEMERAL TYPICALLY PRETTY SHORT-LIVED ORGANISM
THAT'S PARASITIC


189
0:13:17,0 --> 0:13:19,41
ON THE MORE LONG, TYPICALLY MORE, OFTEN MORE
LONG-LIVED


190
0:13:19,41 --> 0:13:25,77
GAMETOPHYTE. AND IT BASICALLY IS PRETTY MUCH
AN ORGANISM THAT


191
0:13:25,77 --> 0:13:29,23
PRODUCES SPORES BY MEIOSIS AND IT DOESN'T
HAVE A LOT MORE GOING


192
0:13:29,23 --> 0:13:34,64
FOR IT. IT'S, IT'S BEEN INTERJECTED INTO THIS
LIFE CYCLE. I


193
0:13:34,64 --> 0:13:40,22
MEAN WE KNOW THAT THE, THAT A HAPLOID ORGANISM
WITHOUT A DIPLOID


194
0:13:40,22 --> 0:13:43,33
GENERATION WAS ANCESTRAL TO ALL THE LAND PLANTS.
AND WE


195
0:13:43,33 --> 0:13:47,14
BASICALLY HAD THE INTERJECTION OF A SPOROPHYTE
GENERATION HERE


196
0:13:47,14 --> 0:13:52,64
THAT IS PARASITIC ON THE GAMETOPHYTE. OKAY,
SO THE SPOROPHYTE


197
0:13:52,64 --> 0:13:56,76
DOES PRODUCE SPORES. AND THESE SPORES AS I
MENTIONED ARE


198
0:13:56,76 --> 0:13:59,709
SOMEWHAT RESISTANT TO DESICCATION. THEY'RE
COVERED WITH A


199
0:13:59,709 --> 0:14:2,79
SUBSTANCE CALLED SPOROPOLLENIN THAT MAKES
THEM RESISTANT. AND IT


200
0:14:2,79 --> 0:14:7,29
ALSO IS PRESENT IN THE ZYGOTES OF THE CLOSELY
RELATED GREEN


201
0:14:7,29 --> 0:14:11,279
ALGAE, THE CHAROPHYTES. BUT IT'S, THESE ARE
LAND DISPERSED


202
0:14:11,279 --> 0:14:16,81
SPORES. AND THEY GERMINATE. MITOSES OCCUR.
WE GET A


203
0:14:16,81 --> 0:14:22,58
FILAMENOUS GAMETOPHYTE INITIALLY IN THIS MOSSES.
THIS IS A MOSS


204
0:14:22,58 --> 0:14:27,8
LIFE CYCLE HERE. AND EVENTUALLY WE GET THE
MATURE GAMETOPHYTES


205
0:14:27,8 --> 0:14:32,94
FORMING WHICH LOOK LEAFY. AND AT THEIR APEX
WE HAVE GAMETANGIA


206
0:14:32,94 --> 0:14:36,629
PRODUCED. REMEMBER THESE ARE THE SAC-LIKE
STRUCTURES THAT BEAR


207
0:14:36,629 --> 0:14:36,63



208
0:14:36,63 --> 0:14:41,45
THE GAMETES ON GAMETOPHYTES. AND IN A LOT
OF MOSSES LIKE THE ONE


209
0:14:41,45 --> 0:14:45,58
REPRESENTED HERE, WE HAVE UNISEXUAL GAMETOPHYTES.
THERE ARE TWO


210
0:14:45,58 --> 0:14:49,43
DIFFERENT TYPES OF GAMETOPHYTES, ONE THAT
PRODUCES SPERM, ONE


211
0:14:49,43 --> 0:14:53,61
THAT PRODUCES EGGS. BUT SOME OF, SOME OF THE
MOSSES HAVE


212
0:14:53,61 --> 0:14:57,839
BISEXUAL GAMETOPHYTES OR HERMAPHRODITIC GAMETOPHYTES
THAT PRODUCE


213
0:14:57,839 --> 0:15:2,42
BOTH GAMET-, BOTH TYPES OF GAMETANGIA. AND
WE CALL THOSE


214
0:15:2,42 --> 0:15:7,45
ANTHERIDIA. SINGULAR WOULD BE THE ANTHERIDIUM
WHICH PRODUCES


215
0:15:7,45 --> 0:15:11,83
THE SPERM. AND THE ARCHEGONIA OR THE ARCHEGONIUM
IS SINGULAR,


216
0:15:11,83 --> 0:15:17,61
THAT'S THE TYPE OF GAMETANGIA THAT PRODUCES
AN EGG. AND SO ONE


217
0:15:17,61 --> 0:15:22,74
OF THINGS THAT PRETTY MUCH LOCKS THE MOSSES
INTO AT LEAST


218
0:15:22,74 --> 0:15:26,89
SEASONALLY WET ENVIRONMENTS TO SOME EXTENT
IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE


219
0:15:26,89 --> 0:15:31,86
SEXUALLY REPRODUCING IS THAT THEY HAVE FREE-SWIMMING
SPERM. AND


220
0:15:31,86 --> 0:15:36,29
THE SPERM HAS TO LEAVE THE ANTHERIDIUM AND
SWIM TO THE NECK OF


221
0:15:36,29 --> 0:15:41,31
THE ARCHEGONIUM AND SWIM DOWN THE CANAL OF
THE ARCHEGONIUM WHICH


222
0:15:41,31 --> 0:15:45,43
IS THE FLASK-SHAPED GAMETANGIUM WITH AN OPENING
AT THE TIP AND


223
0:15:45,43 --> 0:15:47,899
THEN A LONG NECK. AND THEN AT THE BASE IT'S
SWOLLEN AND THERE'S


224
0:15:47,899 --> 0:15:53,149
AN EGG THERE. THAT'S A TYPICAL SHAPE OF AN
ARCHEGONIUM. AND


225
0:15:53,149 --> 0:15:57,399
THE SPERM HAVE TO SWIM DOWN THERE TO FERTILIZE
THE EGG. BUT NOT


226
0:15:57,399 --> 0:16:2,26
ONLY DOES THE FEMALE GAMETANGIUM PRODUCE A
GAMETE, THE EGG, BUT


227
0:16:2,26 --> 0:16:6,6
IT'S ALSO WHERE FERTILIZATION OCCURS AND WHERE
THE EMBRYO


228
0:16:6,6 --> 0:16:12,399
DEVELOPS. SO IT'S ANALOGOUS IN A LOT OF WAYS
TO FEMALE


229
0:16:12,399 --> 0:16:15,7
REPRODUCTIVE TRACKS IN ANIMALS, BUT IT'S COMPLETELY
INDEPENDENT


230
0:16:15,7 --> 0:16:21,32
EVOLUTION OF THOSE, OF THESE FEATURES. AND
SO WE SEE A


231
0:16:21,32 --> 0:16:25,6
FERTILIZATION OCCURRING HERE. THE ZYGOTE DOWN
AT THE BASE OF


232
0:16:25,6 --> 0:16:31,89
THE ARCHEGONIUM, DIPLOID NOW. AND THEN THIS
UNDERGOES MITOSES


233
0:16:31,89 --> 0:16:31,89



234
0:16:31,89 --> 0:16:35,8
TO FORM AN EMBRYO. NOW AN EMBRYO IN PLANTS
BASICALLY JUST


235
0:16:35,8 --> 0:16:40,72
REFERS TO AN IMMATURE SPOROPHYTE THAT'S AT
THE STAGE WHERE THERE


236
0:16:40,72 --> 0:16:45,2
CAN BE A RESTING STAGE. AND IT'S ELABORATED
TO A GREATER OR


237
0:16:45,2 --> 0:16:49,54
LESSER EXTENT IN DIFFERENT GROUPS OF LAND
PLANTS. BUT THEY ALL


238
0:16:49,54 --> 0:16:52,79
HAVE EMBRYOS. AND SO ALL THE LAND PLANTS,
THAT IS THE


239
0:16:52,79 --> 0:16:57,649
BRYOPHYTES PLUS THE VASCULAR PLANTS ARE OFTEN
CALLED EMBRYOPHYTES


240
0:16:57,649 --> 0:17:1,38
OR EMBRYO-PRODUCING PLANTS. AND THE EMBRYO
BECOMES REALLY


241
0:17:1,38 --> 0:17:4,49
IMPORTANT WHEN WE GET TO THE SEED PLANTS.
TALK ABOUT THEM


242
0:17:4,49 --> 0:17:9,13
SHORTLY. BUT HERE'S THE YOUNG SPOROPHYTE THEN
DEVELOPING. AND


243
0:17:9,13 --> 0:17:12,309
AS I MENTIONED, IT'S PARASITIC ON THE GAMETOPHYTE,
THE MATERNAL


244
0:17:12,309 --> 0:17:17,589
GAMETOPHYTE. SO IT HAS A FOOT HERE, WHAT THEY
CALL A FOOT


245
0:17:17,589 --> 0:17:21,4
THAT'S, IT'S ACTUALLY EMBEDDED IN THE TIP
OF THE GAMETANGIUM OR


246
0:17:21,4 --> 0:17:25,709
IN THE TIP OF THE GAMETOPHYTE HERE. AND IT
ALSO HAS A STALK AND


247
0:17:25,709 --> 0:17:29,99
MOSSES WHICH WE CALL THE SETA. AND AT THE
TIP OF IT IS


248
0:17:29,99 --> 0:17:33,929
BASICALLY JUST THE SPORANGIUM, WHICH IS SOME,
WHICH THE MOSS


249
0:17:33,929 --> 0:17:38,98
SPECIALISTS, THE BRYOLOGISTS CALL A CAPSULE.
AND HERE YOU CAN


250
0:17:38,98 --> 0:17:43,47
SEE THE SPORANGIUM OR THE CAPSULE MAGNIFIED.
AND HERE YOU CAN


251
0:17:43,47 --> 0:17:48,179
SEE THE TIP OF IT MAGNIFIED USING SCANNING
ELECTRON MICROSCOPY TO


252
0:17:48,179 --> 0:17:52,46
SHOW THIS ELABORATE STRUCTURE AT THE TIP CALLED
A PERISTOME.


253
0:17:52,46 --> 0:17:55,38
AND THE MAIN POINT HERE IS THAT THE MOSSES
CAN REGULATE THEIR


254
0:17:55,38 --> 0:18:0,25
SPORE DISPERSAL BY MEANS OF THIS SPECIALIZED
STRUCTURE THAT


255
0:18:0,25 --> 0:18:5,13
RESPONDS TO ATMOSPHERIC HUMIDITY SUCH THAT
SPORES WILL TEND TO BE


256
0:18:5,13 --> 0:18:9,71
RELEASED WHEN IT'S DRY OUT. SO IT'S MORE EASY
TO DISPERSE


257
0:18:9,71 --> 0:18:13,4
SPORES INTO THE ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM AWAY
FROM THE PARENT


258
0:18:13,4 --> 0:18:19,72
GAMETOPHYTE OR AND THE PARENT SPOROPHYTE HERE
IF, IF IT'S DRY, IF


259
0:18:19,72 --> 0:18:19,72



260
0:18:19,72 --> 0:18:23,9
WE HAVE DRY, A DRY CLIMATE. AND UNDER WET
CONDITIONS IT WOULD BE


261
0:18:23,9 --> 0:18:28,25
ENCLOSED. SO THE SPORES HAVE SOME, SOME REGULATION
OF THEIR


262
0:18:28,25 --> 0:18:32,47
SPORE DISPERSAL THAT'S A NICE ADAPTATION TO
LAND. WE DON'T SEE


263
0:18:32,47 --> 0:18:36,41
THIS STRUCTURE IN THE LIVERWORTS OR THE HORNWORTS,
THE OTHER TWO


264
0:18:36,41 --> 0:18:41,309
GROUPS OF BRYOPHYTES. ALSO SOME OF THE MOSSES
HAVE THE ABILITY


265
0:18:41,309 --> 0:18:48,39
TO CONDUCT WATER AND NUTRIENTS IN THEIR TISSUES
BY MEANS OF


266
0:18:48,39 --> 0:18:53,4
SPECIALIZED CONDUCTING CELLS THAT DON'T APPEAR
TO BE HOMOLOGOUS


267
0:18:53,4 --> 0:18:56,51
WITH THOSE IN VASCULAR PLANTS. AND THEY'RE
NOT STRONGLY


268
0:18:56,51 --> 0:19:0,24
REINFORCED STRUCTURALLY SO THEY DON'T ALLOW
MOSSES TO GET VERY


269
0:19:0,24 --> 0:19:3,929
LARGE. THE LARGEST BRYOPHYTES ARE TYPICALLY
ONLY ABOUT


270
0:19:3,929 --> 0:19:9,35
15 CENTIMETERS TALL, SO UNDER A FOOT TALL.
NOT VERY BIG PLANTS.


271
0:19:9,35 --> 0:19:12,429
SOME OF THE MOSSES CAN GET UP TO A COUPLE
OF METERS TALL, BUT


272
0:19:12,429 --> 0:19:18,36
THOSE ARE REAL EXCEPTIONS. OKAY, SO JUST TO,
SO ARE THERE


273
0:19:18,36 --> 0:19:24,74
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LIFE CYCLE OF BRYOPHYTES?
OR SOME OF THESE?


274
0:19:24,74 --> 0:19:25,6
YEAH?


275
0:19:25,6 --> 0:19:27,33
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].


276
0:19:27,33 --> 0:19:32,49
PROFESSOR: YEAH, THEY HAVE A SIMILAR LIFE
CYCLE. IN THE


277
0:19:32,49 --> 0:19:35,76
LIVERWORTS, THERE ARE SOME LEAFY LIVERWORTS
THAT HAVE THIS KIND


278
0:19:35,76 --> 0:19:39,88
OF LEAFY APPEARANCE. THE LIFE CYCLE'S PRETTY
MUCH THE SAME


279
0:19:39,88 --> 0:19:43,22
EXCEPT THAT MOST OF THE LIVERWORTS AND HORNWORTS
DON'T HAVE AN


280
0:19:43,22 --> 0:19:47,83
ELONGATED STALK THAT BEARS THE CAPSULE. SO
THE MOSSES GET THEIR


281
0:19:47,83 --> 0:19:53,7
CAPSULE UP AWAY FROM THE GAMETOPHYTE PRETTY
WELL. AND SOME OF


282
0:19:53,7 --> 0:19:56,91
THE LIVERWORTS DO ACTUALLY HAVE A STALK, BUT
THEY, THEY


283
0:19:56,91 --> 0:19:59,82
BASICALLY, WHEN THE SPORES ARE READY TO DISPERSE,
THE CAPSULE


284
0:19:59,82 --> 0:20:2,8
JUST COMPLETELY OPENS UP AND ALL THE SPORES
ARE RELEASED. THEY


285
0:20:2,8 --> 0:20:2,799



286
0:20:2,799 --> 0:20:6,79
DON'T HAVE THIS REGULATION OF SPORE DISPERSAL.
BUT THE GENERAL


287
0:20:6,79 --> 0:20:10,9
STEPS OF THE CYCLE ARE THE SAME. THE GAMETOPHYTE
IS DOMINANT.


288
0:20:10,9 --> 0:20:14,5
AND THE SPOROPHYTE, IF ANYTHING, IS EVEN LESS
CONSPICIOUS. AND


289
0:20:14,5 --> 0:20:18,6
THE LIVERWORTS DEFINITELY. I'LL SHOW YOU A
HORNWORT SPOROPHYTE


290
0:20:18,6 --> 0:20:23,83
IN A MOMENT. THOUGH HERE ARE THE THREE MAJOR
GROUPS OF


291
0:20:23,83 --> 0:20:29,309
BRYOPHYTES JUST BRIEFLY. THE MOSSES, AGAIN
WORLDWIDE, ABOUT


292
0:20:29,309 --> 0:20:34,5
9,000 SPECIES, REALLY PRETTY DIVERSE. PROBABLY
A LOT MORE


293
0:20:34,5 --> 0:20:40,73
SPECIES THAN ARE RECOGNIZED BECAUSE MOSSES
SEEM TO EVOLVE FAIRLY


294
0:20:40,73 --> 0:20:44,169
QUICKLY. I MEAN, I SHOULD SAY THEIR MORPHOLOGY
EVOLVES REALLY


295
0:20:44,169 --> 0:20:48,0
SLOWLY BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY'RE SPECIATING
OR DIVERSIFYING


296
0:20:48,0 --> 0:20:51,6
MUCH MORE RAPIDLY THAN THEY'RE CHANGING IN
CONSPICUOUS WAYS


297
0:20:51,6 --> 0:20:55,2
MORPHOLOGICALLY AND THAT'S CLEAR FROM MOLECULAR
DATA. SO


298
0:20:55,2 --> 0:20:58,48
THEY'RE PROBABLY A MORE DIVERSE GROUP THAN
WE RECOGNIZE. BUT


299
0:20:58,48 --> 0:21:2,15
THEY HAVE THIS GREEN GAMETOPHYTE. IT DOESN'T
LOOK VERY GREEN IN


300
0:21:2,15 --> 0:21:5,99
THIS SHOT BUT THE, TRUST ME, THESE ARE PHYTOSYNTHETIC,
THIS


301
0:21:5,99 --> 0:21:11,66
DARKER AREA. HERE YOU CAN SEE A SHOOT, A GAMETOPHYTE
HERE


302
0:21:11,66 --> 0:21:16,15
THAT'S GREEN. AND HERE'S THE SPOROPHYTE WITH
THE LONG SETA


303
0:21:16,15 --> 0:21:20,24
EMBEDDED IN THE TIP OF THE GAMETOPHYTE. THE
SPORANGIUM OR


304
0:21:20,24 --> 0:21:23,309
CAPSULE, AND THERE'S THE LITTLE PERISTOME
AT THE TIP THAT


305
0:21:23,309 --> 0:21:30,669
REGULATES SPORE DISPERSAL. OKAY, NOW THE LIVERWORTS
ARE, THERE


306
0:21:30,669 --> 0:21:34,48
ARE ABOUT 6,000 SPECIES RECOGNIZED. IT'S STILL
A PRETTY DIVERSE


307
0:21:34,48 --> 0:21:38,59
GROUP. ALSO FOUND WORLDWIDE. AND THEY HAVE
A VARIETY OF


308
0:21:38,59 --> 0:21:43,2
DIFFERENT FORMS. THE ONES YOU MOST COMMONLY
ENCOUNTER, AND ARE


309
0:21:43,2 --> 0:21:46,2
EASILY RECOGNIZABLE IS LIVERWORTS, HAVE THESE
WHAT ARE CALLED


310
0:21:46,2 --> 0:21:49,62
PHALLOID BODIES WHICH ARE BASICALLY JUST FLATTENED
BODIES THAT


311
0:21:49,62 --> 0:21:49,62



312
0:21:49,62 --> 0:21:57,45
LIE FLAT ON SUBSTRATE LIKE SOIL AND CAN BECOME
LOBED LIKE THIS.


313
0:21:57,45 --> 0:22:1,44
AND THE, AS I MENTIONED, THE SPOROPHYTE IS
PRETTY MUCH EMBEDDED


314
0:22:1,44 --> 0:22:6,28
USUALLY INSIDE THE GAMETOPHYTE, ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES
ON A STALK.


315
0:22:6,28 --> 0:22:9,27
BUT THE STALK IS PRETTY FRAGILE BY COMPARISON
WITH THE ONE THAT


316
0:22:9,27 --> 0:22:16,85
WE DID IN MOSSES IF THERE IS ONE. AND THE
HORNWORTS ARE A


317
0:22:16,85 --> 0:22:18,79
PRETTY LOW DIVERSITY GROUP. THERE ARE JUST
A COUPLE HUNDRED


318
0:22:18,79 --> 0:22:24,12
SPECIES OF THESE. AND THEY ALSO HAVE A PHALLOID
BODY LIKE SOME


319
0:22:24,12 --> 0:22:28,419
OF THE LIVERWORTS THAT'S JUST BASICALLY LYING
FLAT ON SUBSTRATE.


320
0:22:28,419 --> 0:22:34,62
AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THE SPOROPHYTES OF HORNWORTS
WHICH ARE


321
0:22:34,62 --> 0:22:38,35
PHOTOSYNTHETIC. AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE STOMATA
WHICH ARE PORES


322
0:22:38,35 --> 0:22:42,71
THAT REGULATE GAS EXCHANGE WHICH IS INTERESTING.
AND THEY ALSO


323
0:22:42,71 --> 0:22:47,1
HAVE BASICALLY THIS WHOLE ELONGATED HORN-SHAPED
STRUCTURE, WHICH


324
0:22:47,1 --> 0:22:51,44
IS THE BASIS OF THE NAME HORNWORT, IS A CAPSULE.
IT'S JUST AN


325
0:22:51,44 --> 0:22:55,9
ELONGATED SPORANGIUM. IT DOESN'T HAVE A STALK.
IT SPLITS OPEN


326
0:22:55,9 --> 0:22:58,84
AT MATURITY. AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE
HORNWORTS ARE THE


327
0:22:58,84 --> 0:23:4,419
CLOSEST RELATIVES OF THE VASCULAR PLANTS OR
THE MOSSES. THERE'S


328
0:23:4,419 --> 0:23:10,66
SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THAT. BUT ANYWAYS,
THERE'S SOME


329
0:23:10,66 --> 0:23:15,79
CONSIDERABLE DIVERSITY IN THE BRYOPHYTES.
AND THESE THREE


330
0:23:15,79 --> 0:23:19,169
GROUPS ARE DEFINITELY NATURAL GROUPS. AND
WORT, YOU'LL SEE THE


331
0:23:19,169 --> 0:23:23,299
NAME WORT USED A LOT IN BOTANY. IT'S JUST
AN ARCHAIC TERM FOR


332
0:23:23,299 --> 0:23:27,799
AN HERB, BASICALLY A NON-WOODY PLANT. SO THAT'S
WHAT THE BASIS


333
0:23:27,799 --> 0:23:33,61
FOR WORT IS. OKAY, SO THOSE ARE THE THREE
MAJOR GROUPS OF


334
0:23:33,61 --> 0:23:37,53
BRYOPHYTES. AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT THEY
BEGAN TO DIVERSIFY


335
0:23:37,53 --> 0:23:44,12
FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR, OOPS, PRIOR TO THE
ORIGIN OF THE VASCULAR


336
0:23:44,12 --> 0:23:49,35
PLANTS. REMEMBER THEY'RE A PARAPHYLETIC GROUP.
ALL RIGHT, SO


337
0:23:49,35 --> 0:23:50,12



338
0:23:50,12 --> 0:23:53,97
ECONOMICALLY AND ECOLOGICALLY THE MOSSES ARE
REALLY IMPORTANT.


339
0:23:53,97 --> 0:24:0,539
AND ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T PRODUCE FOOD ITEMS
LIKE VASCULAR PLANTS


340
0:24:0,539 --> 0:24:4,96
FOR US, THEY ARE IMPORTANT IN MANY WAYS. SOME
OF THE MOST


341
0:24:4,96 --> 0:24:9,57
CONSPICUOUSLY IMPORTANT MOSSES -- AND MOSSES
ARE WHERE WE FIND A


342
0:24:9,57 --> 0:24:13,76
LOT OF ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT BRYOPHYTES 
-- ARE THE PEAT MOSSES,


343
0:24:13,76 --> 0:24:17,39
MEMBERS OF THE GENUS SPHAGNUM. IT'S A VERY
DISTINCTIVE MOSS


344
0:24:17,39 --> 0:24:21,74
GROUP. AND THESE ARE OFTEN FOUND IN BOGGY
ENVIRONMENTS,


345
0:24:21,74 --> 0:24:29,73
SATURATING ENVIRONMENTS. AND THEY IMPART ACIDITY,
LOW PH, AND


346
0:24:29,73 --> 0:24:32,82
CERTAIN CHEMICAL PROPERTIES TO THESE BOGS
DUE TO THESE PHENOLIC


347
0:24:32,82 --> 0:24:38,33
COMPOUNDS THEY PRODUCE THAT RESULT IN VERY
LOW RATES OF


348
0:24:38,33 --> 0:24:42,78
DECOMPOSITION IN THESE BOG ENVIRONMENTS. AND
SO THE CARBON


349
0:24:42,78 --> 0:24:48,4
THAT'S FIXED BY THE, BY THE, BY THE PEAT MOSS
AND OTHER


350
0:24:48,4 --> 0:24:51,48
PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS IN THESE SITUATIONS,
IN THESE


351
0:24:51,48 --> 0:24:57,77
ENVIRONMENTS WILL TEND NOT TO DECAY RAPIDLY
AND WILL TEND TO BE


352
0:24:57,77 --> 0:25:1,9
DEPOSITED AND REMAIN IN THE SOIL ENVIRONMENT
OR REMAIN, RAIN OUT


353
0:25:1,9 --> 0:25:6,53
OF THE ATMOSPHERE. AND SO BRYOPHYTES ARE REALLY
IMPORTANT FOR


354
0:25:6,53 --> 0:25:11,299
FIXING CARBON AND KEEPING IT OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE.
AND


355
0:25:11,299 --> 0:25:15,1
UNFORTUNATELY NOW, WELL, THE PEAT HAS ACCUMULATED
OVER THE AGES


356
0:25:15,1 --> 0:25:18,57
TO SUCH AN EXTENT, ESPECIALLY IN SOME NORTHERN
CLIMATES WHERE WE


357
0:25:18,57 --> 0:25:20,9
HAVE COOL TEMPERATURES AND ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS
 -- THAT'S


358
0:25:20,9 --> 0:25:26,669
TYPICALLY WHERE WE FIND SPHAGNUM ARE IN COOL
ENVIRONMENTS -- THAT


359
0:25:26,669 --> 0:25:30,38
NOW THIS IS BEING EXTENSIVELY USED AS FUEL.
AND HERE YOU CAN


360
0:25:30,38 --> 0:25:33,26
SEE, THIS IS ONE OF THESE INDUSTRIAL PEAT
HARVESTING OPERATIONS


361
0:25:33,26 --> 0:25:37,0
IN THE U.K. AND SO A LOT OF THIS CARBON IS
BEING RETURNED BACK TO


362
0:25:37,0 --> 0:25:41,25
THE ATMOSPHERE. BUT EVEN MORE DISCONCERTING
IS THAT A LOT OF THE


363
0:25:41,25 --> 0:25:41,429



364
0:25:41,429 --> 0:25:47,36
PEAT THAT'S BEEN DEPOSITED IN SOILS OVER THE
YEARS, A LOT OF


365
0:25:47,36 --> 0:25:51,64
THESE PEAT ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE STILL INTACT
IN NORTHERN


366
0:25:51,64 --> 0:25:56,549
CLIMATES ARE STARTING TO DRY OUT WITH GLOBAL
CLIMATE CHANGE AND


367
0:25:56,549 --> 0:25:59,53
RATES OF RESPIRATION ARE INCREASING AND THIS
CARBON'S BEING


368
0:25:59,53 --> 0:26:4,32
RETURNED TO THE ATMOSPHERE. SO THERE'S A REAL
CONCERN ABOUT,


369
0:26:4,32 --> 0:26:8,51
ABOUT SOME POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS THAT MIGHT
RESULT IN A LOT OF


370
0:26:8,51 --> 0:26:10,91
CARBON RETURNING TO THE ATMOSPHERE FROM THESE
KINDS OF


371
0:26:10,91 --> 0:26:14,679
ENVIRONMENTS. IN ANY CASE PEAT MOSS IS ALSO
USEFUL


372
0:26:14,679 --> 0:26:19,87
ECONOMICALLY. IT'S, HOLDS WATER REALLY WELL.
AND THE ACIDITY


373
0:26:19,87 --> 0:26:23,11
OF IT, AND AS I MENTIONED THESE PHENOLICS,
MAKE IT AN


374
0:26:23,11 --> 0:26:26,87
ANTIMICROBIAL ENVIRONMENT THAT'S GOOD FOR,
SAY, WRAPPING UP PLANT


375
0:26:26,87 --> 0:26:31,12
CUTTINGS OR ROOTS FOR SHIPMENT. IT'S ALSO
GOOD AS A SOIL


376
0:26:31,12 --> 0:26:35,27
CONDITIONER, ET CETERA. SO THERE ARE A LOT
OF USES FOR PEAT


377
0:26:35,27 --> 0:26:38,63
MOSS. THERE ARE SOME MOSSES TOO THAT ARE MEDICINALLY
IMPORTANT.


378
0:26:38,63 --> 0:26:43,62
IT'S A MINORITY, BUT IN SOME ASIAN MEDICINAL
TRADITIONS THERE ARE


379
0:26:43,62 --> 0:26:48,5
SOME USEFUL MOSES THAT ARE BEING ACTIVELY
STUDIED. NOW ANOTHER


380
0:26:48,5 --> 0:26:52,799
REALLY THING IMPORTANT SCIENTIFICALLY ABOUT
THESE PEAT BOG


381
0:26:52,799 --> 0:26:56,21
ENVIRONMENTS AND BOGGY ENVIRONMENTS IN GENERAL
IS THAT THEIR


382
0:26:56,21 --> 0:27:0,5
ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS -- THE LACK OF OXYGEN,
THE COOL ENVIRONMENT,


383
0:27:0,5 --> 0:27:5,34
THE LOW PH -- HAS NOT ONLY LEAD TO THESE BIG
CARBON DEPOSITS BUT


384
0:27:5,34 --> 0:27:10,25
ALSO PRESERVATION OF FOSSILS. AND A LOT OF
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT


385
0:27:10,25 --> 0:27:14,53
THE LAST SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS OF HISTORY
FROM THE FOSSIL


386
0:27:14,53 --> 0:27:19,96
PERSPECTIVE COMES FROM THESE KINDS OF ENVIRONMENTS.
AND NOT


387
0:27:19,96 --> 0:27:23,34
ONLY PLANT REMAINS ARE PRESERVED IN THESE
SITUATIONS BUT ALSO


388
0:27:23,34 --> 0:27:29,11
ANIMAL REMAINS ARE WELL PRESERVED, INCLUDING
HUMAN REMAINS. AND


389
0:27:29,11 --> 0:27:29,25



390
0:27:29,25 --> 0:27:33,78
IN NORTHERN EUROPE, THERE ARE THESE SO-CALLED
"BOG PEOPLE" THAT


391
0:27:33,78 --> 0:27:38,47
HAVE BEEN EXCAVATED, USUALLY INADVERTENTLY
FROM BOG ENVIRONMENTS.


392
0:27:38,47 --> 0:27:40,86
AND SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS LIKE THIS ONE
LOOK LIKE THEY'RE


393
0:27:40,86 --> 0:27:44,49
SLEEPING. THEY SHOW NO DECOMPOSITION. YOU
CAN MAKE OUT THEIR


394
0:27:44,49 --> 0:27:48,15
FACIAL FEATURES PERFECTLY. AND THEY'RE BASICALLY
JUST DEEPLY


395
0:27:48,15 --> 0:27:52,25
STAINED BY THE PHENOLICS. THIS IS A LEVEL
OF PRESERVATION FOR


396
0:27:52,25 --> 0:27:55,38
CORPSES THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD THAT YOU CAN'T
SEE IN ANY OTHER


397
0:27:55,38 --> 0:27:59,409
CONDITIONS, ANY OTHER SITUATIONS. THERE'S
OVER A THOUSAND OF


398
0:27:59,409 --> 0:28:1,53
THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND. AND YOU
CAN SEE THE ROPE


399
0:28:1,53 --> 0:28:7,2
AROUND THIS PERSON'S NECK. THESE PEOPLE ALMOST
INADVERTENTLY, I


400
0:28:7,2 --> 0:28:12,89
MEAN ALMOST ALWAYS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN EXECUTED.
AND THEY MAY


401
0:28:12,89 --> 0:28:16,47
HAVE BEEN RITUAL SACRIFICES. THEY MAY HAVE
BEEN EXECUTED


402
0:28:16,47 --> 0:28:20,58
CRIMINALS. IT'S UNCLEAR BUT IN ANY CASE THERE'S
A LOT THAT CAN


403
0:28:20,58 --> 0:28:24,539
BE LEARNED ABOUT. THESE ACTUALLY DATE BACK
TO THE IRON AGE, SO


404
0:28:24,539 --> 0:28:27,929
THERE'S A LOT OF IMPORTANT HUMAN REMAINS THAT
HAVE BEEN FOUND IN


405
0:28:27,929 --> 0:28:36,57
THESE SITUATIONS FOR ARCHEOLOGISTS. OKAY.
SO ALSO ANOTHER


406
0:28:36,57 --> 0:28:39,53
THING THAT PEAT MOSS USED TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT
FOR, HERE YOU


407
0:28:39,53 --> 0:28:44,9
CAN SEE SPHAGNUM MOSS FOR THE WOUNDED ON THE
FRONT BEING


408
0:28:44,9 --> 0:28:48,39
HARVESTED UP IN CANADA, BRITISH COLUMBIA,
IN PRINCE RUPERT.


409
0:28:48,39 --> 0:28:51,69
PEAT MOSS WAS EXTENSIVELY COLLECTED AND SHIPPED
TO THE FRONT


410
0:28:51,69 --> 0:28:57,99
DURING WORLD WAR I TO USE AS STERILE BANDAGING
FOR SOLDIERS THAT


411
0:28:57,99 --> 0:29:1,9
WERE INVOLVED IN TRENCH WARFARE IN THESE REALLY
UNSANITARY


412
0:29:1,9 --> 0:29:6,429
CONDITIONS. AND IT SAVED A LOT OF LIVES AT
A TIME WHEN


413
0:29:6,429 --> 0:29:13,36
ANTIBIOTICS, PENICILLIN IN PARTICULAR, WASN'T
AVAILABLE. THOUGH


414
0:29:13,36 --> 0:29:16,269
THAT'S NOT SUCH A COMMON USE ANYMORE OF COURSE,
BUT THAT'S AN


415
0:29:16,269 --> 0:29:16,27



416
0:29:16,27 --> 0:29:20,52
INTERESTING HISTORICAL FOOTNOTE. OKAY, SO
NOW WE'RE GOING TO


417
0:29:20,52 --> 0:29:24,59
MOVE ON TO VASCULAR PLANTS, WHICH AS I MENTIONED
THESE ARE THE


418
0:29:24,59 --> 0:29:29,62
ORGANISMS THAT DOMINATE THE TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENT
TODAY AND


419
0:29:29,62 --> 0:29:36,49
THAT HAVE EXTENSIVE CONDUCTING TISSUE TO CONDUCT
BOTH WATER AND


420
0:29:36,49 --> 0:29:43,19
NUTRIENTS IN THEIR PLANT BODY. THEY ALSO HAVE
WELL-DEVELOPED


421
0:29:43,19 --> 0:29:48,45
ROOT SYSTEMS FOR CONDUCTING WATER AND WELL-DEVELOPED
CUTICLES,


422
0:29:48,45 --> 0:29:52,809
THAT IS WAXY COVERINGS ON THEIR SPOROPHYTE
GENERATION. WE SHOW


423
0:29:52,809 --> 0:29:59,12
A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT FEATURES FOR SURVIVAL
ON LAND. AND ONE OF


424
0:29:59,12 --> 0:30:3,7
THE MOST INTERESTING FOSSIL FINDINGS ABOUT
ANCIENT VASCULAR


425
0:30:3,7 --> 0:30:9,39
PLANTS WHICH ARE A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP IS THAT
THE EARLIEST


426
0:30:9,39 --> 0:30:13,33
VASCULAR PLANTS APPEAR VERY DIFFERENT FROM
OUR MODERN VASCULAR


427
0:30:13,33 --> 0:30:17,2
PLANTS. AND THESE ARISE ABOUT 50 MILLION YEARS
AFTER THE


428
0:30:17,2 --> 0:30:22,22
BRYOPHYTES FIRST APPEAR. AND THESE THINGS
ARE ONLY ABOUT THE


429
0:30:22,22 --> 0:30:27,7
SIZE OF A MATCHSTICK. THESE ARE REALLY SMALL.
AND THEY DON'T


430
0:30:27,7 --> 0:30:30,549
HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF CONDUCTING TISSUE.
THEY ALSO DON'T HAVE


431
0:30:30,549 --> 0:30:33,11
ANY LEAVES. THIS IS, THIS ARTIST'S RENDITION
IS ACTUALLY


432
0:30:33,11 --> 0:30:36,7
INACCURATE. YOU CAN, THIS IS, THESE SHOULD'T
BE, THIS SHOULDN'T


433
0:30:36,7 --> 0:30:39,13
SHOW LEAVES HERE. THESE ACTUALLY AREN'T THERE
IN THE FOSSILS.


434
0:30:39,13 --> 0:30:43,559
THERE ARE NO LEAVES. THERE ARE NO ROOTS. AND
THEY HAVE


435
0:30:43,559 --> 0:30:47,69
DICHOTOMOUS BRANCHING WHICH MEANS THERE'S
NO APICAL DOMINANCE OF


436
0:30:47,69 --> 0:30:51,99
ANY PARTICULAR BRANCH. THE APEX OF THE SHOOT
JUST SPLITS INTO


437
0:30:51,99 --> 0:30:56,61
TWO EQUAL BRANCHES AND YOU GET THIS Y-SHAPED
BRANCHING THROUGHOUT


438
0:30:56,61 --> 0:31:1,9
THE PLANT. AND THE TIPS OF THE BRANCHES ARE
TERMINATED BY THESE


439
0:31:1,9 --> 0:31:5,11
REPRODUCTIVE BODIES, EITHER BY A SPORANGIUM
IN THE CASE OF A


440
0:31:5,11 --> 0:31:10,559
SPOROPHYTE OR A GAMETANGIUM IN THE CASE OF
A GAMETOPHYTE. AND


441
0:31:10,559 --> 0:31:10,57



442
0:31:10,57 --> 0:31:13,77
THE GAMETOPHYTE GENERATION AND THE SPOROPHYTE
GENERATION, THE


443
0:31:13,77 --> 0:31:18,94
HAPLOID AND THE DIPLOID GENERATIONS ARE VERY,
VERY SIMILAR


444
0:31:18,94 --> 0:31:23,29
MORPHOLOGICALLY. SO WE'VE GONE FROM A SPORE
OR GAMETOPHYTE


445
0:31:23,29 --> 0:31:28,529
DOMINANT GENERATION, I SHOULD SAY GAMETOPHYTE
DOMINANT LIFE CYCLE


446
0:31:28,529 --> 0:31:33,309
AND THE BRYOPHYTES, TO A LIFE CYCLE WHERE
THE GAMETOPHYTE AND THE


447
0:31:33,309 --> 0:31:35,69
SPOROPHYTE SHARE DOMINANCE WHERE THEY ESSENTIALLY
ARE ON EQUAL


448
0:31:35,69 --> 0:31:38,73
FOOTING AS FAR AS THE DEGREE OF ELABORATION
OF THESE TWO


449
0:31:38,73 --> 0:31:45,75
GENERATIONS. THOUGH THAT'S A, A VERY SIMPLE
VASCULAR PLANT


450
0:31:45,75 --> 0:31:49,279
ORGANIZATION. AND THERE ARE NO MEMBERS OF
THIS GROUP LEFT


451
0:31:49,279 --> 0:31:53,159
TODAY. THEY'RE EXTINCT. RHYNIOPHYTE IS THE
NAME, NAMED AFTER


452
0:31:53,159 --> 0:31:57,48
THE RHYNIE CHERT WHERE THEY WERE FOUND IN
THE U.K. BUT THESE


453
0:31:57,48 --> 0:32:3,74
AREN'T AROUND ANYMORE, SO WE WON'T BE SEEING
THESE. THE MODERN


454
0:32:3,74 --> 0:32:8,83
VASCULAR PLANTS INCLUDE THOSE, THE FOUR GROUPS
THAT I MENTIONED


455
0:32:8,83 --> 0:32:14,9
EARLIER HERE. HERE YOU CAN SEE VASCULAR PLANTS,
THE LYCOPHYTES,


456
0:32:14,9 --> 0:32:17,779
WHICH OFTEN HAVE BEEN CALLED THE FERN ALLIES.
THE TRUE FERNS


457
0:32:17,779 --> 0:32:20,929
AND RELATIVES AND THEN THE SEED PLANTS OF
WHICH THERE ARE


458
0:32:20,929 --> 0:32:24,74
GYMNOSPERMS AND ANGIOSPERMS. WE'LL BE TALKING
ABOUT THESE A


459
0:32:24,74 --> 0:32:29,74
LOT. SO FIRST IT'S EASIEST TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO TWO OF THESE


460
0:32:29,74 --> 0:32:34,52
LINEAGES WHICH WE CALL THE FREE-SPORING VASCULAR
PLANTS. AND


461
0:32:34,52 --> 0:32:36,6
THESE REALLY SHOULD BE IN QUOTES BECAUSE THIS
IS NOT A


462
0:32:36,6 --> 0:32:42,14
MONOPHYLETIC GROUP. BUT IT INCLUDES TWO MONOPHYLETIC
GROUPS,


463
0:32:42,14 --> 0:32:48,409
THE FERNS AND RELATIVES, AND THE LYCOPHYTES.
LYCOPHYTES HAVE


464
0:32:48,409 --> 0:32:50,85
OFTEN BEEN THOUGHT TO BE VERY, VERY CLOSELY
RELATED TO THE FERNS.


465
0:32:50,85 --> 0:32:54,88
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED FERN ALLIES COMMONLY.
BUT, IN FACT,


466
0:32:54,88 --> 0:32:58,35
THE FERNS AND RELATIVES ARE MORE CLOSELY RELATED
TO THE SEED


467
0:32:58,35 --> 0:32:58,35



468
0:32:58,35 --> 0:33:2,9
PLANTS THAN THEY ARE TO THE LYCOPHYTES. AND
THIS HAS BEEN


469
0:33:2,9 --> 0:33:5,4
REINFORCED BY MANY LINES OF EVIDENCE. THIS
IS A BULLETPROOF


470
0:33:5,4 --> 0:33:10,21
FINDING AT THIS POINT. THE LYCOPHYTES ARE
SISTER TO ALL THE


471
0:33:10,21 --> 0:33:17,429
OTHER VASCULAR PLANTS. AND THE LYCOPHYTES,
THESE SO-CALLED FERN


472
0:33:17,429 --> 0:33:22,26
ALLIES PLUS THE FERNS, THEY BOTH FREELY DISPERSE
THEIR SPORES


473
0:33:22,26 --> 0:33:26,11
INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. SO THEY DON'T HAVE SEEDS.
THESE ARE THE


474
0:33:26,11 --> 0:33:30,49
SEEDLESS VASCULAR PLANTS AS OPPOSED TO THIS
VASCULAR PLANTS THAT


475
0:33:30,49 --> 0:33:34,5
HAVE SEEDS, THE SEED PLANTS HERE. WELL THE
ABSENCE OF SEEDS IS


476
0:33:34,5 --> 0:33:38,309
A PRIMITIVE OR ANCESTRAL FEATURE, SO IT SHOULDN'T
BE A SURPRISE


477
0:33:38,309 --> 0:33:41,32
THAT THESE AREN'T A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP TAKEN
TOGETHER. BUT


478
0:33:41,32 --> 0:33:46,89
THESE ARE TWO WELL-SUPPORTED CLADES, THESE
TWO GROUPS. AND HERE


479
0:33:46,89 --> 0:33:51,46
THERE ARE, THE SEEDLESS VASCULAR PLANTS. LYCOPHYTES
ON THE


480
0:33:51,46 --> 0:33:56,45
RIGHT. AND FERNS, HORSETAILS AND WHISK FERNS,
WHICH ARE ALL


481
0:33:56,45 --> 0:34:1,39
BASICALLY THE FERN GROUP, ON THE LEFT. NOW
THE LYCOPHYTES WHICH


482
0:34:1,39 --> 0:34:6,48
ARE SISTER TO ALL THE OTHER VASCULAR PLANTS
ARE INTERESTING


483
0:34:6,48 --> 0:34:9,89
BECAUSE THERE ARE BASICALLY THREE MAJOR GROUPS
THAT ARE STILL


484
0:34:9,89 --> 0:34:12,33
ALIVE. TWO OF THEM ARE SHOWN HERE. AND YOU
MIGHT AT THESE AND


485
0:34:12,33 --> 0:34:15,58
SAY, WAIT A MINUTE, HE MIXED UP THE SLIDES.
THOSE ARE MOSSES.


486
0:34:15,58 --> 0:34:19,169
WELL, THEY LOOK LIKE MOSSES. BUT THESE ARE
SPOROPHYTES, NOT


487
0:34:19,169 --> 0:34:23,83
GAMETOPHYTES. SO THE DOMINANT GENERATION IN
ALL THE MODERN


488
0:34:23,83 --> 0:34:26,849
VASCULAR PLANTS, INCLUDING THE LYCOPHYTES
IS THE SPOROPHYTE


489
0:34:26,849 --> 0:34:32,3
GENERATION. THE GAMETOPHYTE GENERATION IS
HIGHLY REDUCED. SO


490
0:34:32,3 --> 0:34:36,19
WE'VE GONE FROM ONLY HAVING A GAMETOPHYTE
GENERATION, IN THE CASE


491
0:34:36,19 --> 0:34:39,58
OF THE FRESHWATER GREEN ALGAE THAT ARE CLOSELY
RELATED TO LAND


492
0:34:39,58 --> 0:34:44,69
PLANTS, TO HAVING A GAMETOPHYTE DOMINANT ALTERNATION
OF


493
0:34:44,69 --> 0:34:44,69



494
0:34:44,69 --> 0:34:47,849
GENERATIONS WITH A PARASITIC SPOROPHYTE IN
THE BRYOPHYTES.


495
0:34:47,849 --> 0:34:52,31
THOUGH THE SHARING OF DOMINANCE IN THE FIRST
VASCULAR PLANTS THAT


496
0:34:52,31 --> 0:34:55,379
ARE NOW EXTINCT, SHARING OF DOMINANCE BETWEEN
THE GAMETOPHYTE AND


497
0:34:55,379 --> 0:34:59,41
THE SPOROPHYTE. AND IN ALL THE MODERN VASCULAR
PLANTS THE


498
0:34:59,41 --> 0:35:3,13
SPOROPHYTE IS DOMINATE. IT'S THE MAJOR PHOTOSYNTHETIC
ORGANISM,


499
0:35:3,13 --> 0:35:6,93
THE BIG BRANCHING ORGANISM. AND THE GAMETOPHYTE
IS HIGHLY


500
0:35:6,93 --> 0:35:12,0
REDUCED. THOUGH IN LYCOPHYTES HERE WE SEE,
ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN


501
0:35:12,0 --> 0:35:16,849
TELL THESE AREN'T MOSSES, IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY
YOU SEE THAT THERE


502
0:35:16,849 --> 0:35:22,89
ARE ACTUALLY, WELL, IT'S HARD TO MAKE OUT,
BUT THERE ARE CONES ON


503
0:35:22,89 --> 0:35:27,109
THESE, ACTUAL STROBILI. SO IN A LOT OF THE
VASCULAR PLANTS WE


504
0:35:27,109 --> 0:35:31,96
HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED CONES OR A STROBILUS
OR STROBILI, PLURAL,


505
0:35:31,96 --> 0:35:38,3
WHICH ARE BASICALLY JUST A STRUCTURE MADE
UP OF MODIFIED LEAVES


506
0:35:38,3 --> 0:35:42,58
THAT ARE IN ASSOCIATION WITH SPORANGIA. SO
IT'S A STRUCTURE


507
0:35:42,58 --> 0:35:48,839
THAT BEARS SPORANGIA. AND THESE INCLUDE, IN
THIS PARTICULAR


508
0:35:48,839 --> 0:35:52,119
GROUP WHAT ARE CALLED THE SPIKE MOSSES. THESE
ARE THE CLUB


509
0:35:52,119 --> 0:35:56,23
MOSES. THESE ARE NOT MOSSES THOUGH. THEY'RE,
THEY ARE VASCULAR


510
0:35:56,23 --> 0:35:59,0
PLANTS. IN THIS GROUP WE HAVE DESICCATION
TOLERANCE IN SOME OF


511
0:35:59,0 --> 0:36:2,99
THEM. THEY CAN DRY OUT COMPLETELY AND REVIVE.
SO SOME OF THESE


512
0:36:2,99 --> 0:36:9,15
EARLY BRANCHING LINEAGES OF VASCULAR PLANTS
DO HAVE THIS ABILITY


513
0:36:9,15 --> 0:36:15,0
TO DESICCATE AND REVIVE. BUT IT'S VERY LIMITED
WITHIN THE


514
0:36:15,0 --> 0:36:19,359
VASCULAR PLANTS IN GENERAL. OKAY, SO THE LYCOPHYTES
ARE


515
0:36:19,359 --> 0:36:23,1
WIDESPREAD. THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 1200 SPECIES
WORLDWIDE. IT'S


516
0:36:23,1 --> 0:36:26,7
NOT A VERY DIVERSE GROUP. BUT IT USED TO BE
REALLY DIVERSE,


517
0:36:26,7 --> 0:36:30,64
AND I'LL SHOW YOU SOME ANCIENT LYCOPHYTES
IN A MOMENT. BACK IN


518
0:36:30,64 --> 0:36:35,61
THE CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD, IN THE PALEOZOIC
THEY WERE REALLY BIG


519
0:36:35,61 --> 0:36:35,75



520
0:36:35,75 --> 0:36:40,75
TREES. NOW THEY'RE JUST SMALL PLANTS THAT,
YOU KNOW, DON'T


521
0:36:40,75 --> 0:36:44,57
TYPICALLY GET MORE THAN ABOUT YEA BIG. SO
THAT'S A, IT'S NOT A


522
0:36:44,57 --> 0:36:48,869
PARTICULARLY CONSPICUOUS GROUP OF PLANTS EVEN
THOUGH THEY'RE


523
0:36:48,869 --> 0:36:53,83
FOUND FROM TROPICAL TO TEMPERATE ENVIRONMENTS.
OKAY, THE FERNS


524
0:36:53,83 --> 0:36:57,94
AND RELATIVES ARE MUCH MORE DIVERSE. THERE
ARE ABOUT 12,000


525
0:36:57,94 --> 0:37:0,15
SPECIES OF THESE. ABOUT TEN TIMES MORE THAN
THERE ARE OF THE


526
0:37:0,15 --> 0:37:5,68
LYCOPHYTES. AND PROBABLY A LOT OF UNDESCRIBED
DIVERSITY TOO.


527
0:37:5,68 --> 0:37:11,8
NOW WE SINGLE OUT THE HORSETAILS HERE AND
THE WHISK FERNS HERE


528
0:37:11,8 --> 0:37:14,66
BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY FAIRLY RECENTLY, WITHIN
THE LAST TEN, 15


529
0:37:14,66 --> 0:37:18,42
YEARS THAT IT WAS REALIZED THAT THESE ARE
NOT, THAT THESE ARE


530
0:37:18,42 --> 0:37:24,26
ACTUALLY FERNS. THESE DON'T LOOK TOO FERN-LIKE.
THEIR STEMS,


531
0:37:24,26 --> 0:37:29,73
THEY HAVE AERIAL STEMS THAT ARE PHOTOSYNTHETIC
AND IMPREGNATED


532
0:37:29,73 --> 0:37:34,51
WITH SILICA, THE HORSETAILS. THESE WHORLED
BRANCHES, WITH MINI


533
0:37:34,51 --> 0:37:37,839
BRANCHES THAT ARE NODE, IT'S A VERY BIZARRE
LOOKING PLANT.


534
0:37:37,839 --> 0:37:40,4
THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT A DOZEN SPECIES WORLDWIDE.
BUT THEY'RE WIDE


535
0:37:40,4 --> 0:37:45,28
SPREAD IN NORTHERN TEMPERATE AREAS. IN ANY
CASE, THIS IS A GROUP


536
0:37:45,28 --> 0:37:47,72
THAT WAS THOUGHT TO REPRESENT A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT LINEAGE, BUT


537
0:37:47,72 --> 0:37:51,68
IN FACT TURNS OUT TO BE A FERN GROUP. AND
THIS THING MAY LOOK


538
0:37:51,68 --> 0:37:56,33
FAMILIAR AS SIMILAR TO THAT EARLIEST VASCULAR
PLANT THAT I SHOWED


539
0:37:56,33 --> 0:38:0,99
YOU WITH THAT Y-SHAPED BRANCHING AND AND NO
LEAVES. AND IT


540
0:38:0,99 --> 0:38:3,27
DOESN'T HAVE ROOTS EITHER. IT'S ONE OF THE
FEW VASCULAR PLANTS


541
0:38:3,27 --> 0:38:7,26
THAT DOESN'T HAVE ROOTS. AND IT WAS THOUGHT
TO BE ONE OF THE


542
0:38:7,26 --> 0:38:10,72
LAST SURVIVING REMNANTS OF THAT EARLIEST GROUP
OF VASCULAR PLANTS


543
0:38:10,72 --> 0:38:14,589
UNTIL MOLECULAR DATA CAME ALONG AND SHOWED
THAT IT'S JUST A


544
0:38:14,589 --> 0:38:19,52
HIGHLY MODIFIED FERN. SO THE GUY THAT ACTUALLY
USED TO PUSH THE


545
0:38:19,52 --> 0:38:19,52



546
0:38:19,52 --> 0:38:24,83
IDEA THAT THIS WAS THE LAST OF THE RHYNIOPHYTES
WHEN HE, HE WAS


547
0:38:24,83 --> 0:38:27,28
ACTUALLY PRESENT WHEN THE MOLECULAR DATA WERE
PRESENTED SHOWING


548
0:38:27,28 --> 0:38:31,99
THAT THE WHISK FERNS ARE FERNS AND NOT ANCIENT
RHYNIOPHYTES.


549
0:38:31,99 --> 0:38:33,589
AND HE STOOD UP AND SAID, YOU KNOW HE WAS
AN OLD MAN AT POINT


550
0:38:33,589 --> 0:38:36,869
POINT, HE STOOD UP AND SAID, YOU JUST RUINED
MY LIFE, YOU KNOW,


551
0:38:36,869 --> 0:38:40,32
TO THE GUY THAT MADE THAT FINDING. SO IT WAS
A PRETTY DRAMATIC


552
0:38:40,32 --> 0:38:45,93
MOMENT AND, FOR THE SPEAKER WHO WAS JUST A
YOUNG GRADUATE


553
0:38:45,93 --> 0:38:51,16
STUDENT. AND THE GUY THAT SAID THAT, YOU KNOW
THAT HE WRECKED


554
0:38:51,16 --> 0:38:55,15
HIS LIFE, WAS ONE OF THE, WAS CONSIDERED THE
WORLD AUTHORITY ON


555
0:38:55,15 --> 0:39:2,19
SEEDLESS VASCULAR PLANTS. OKAY, SO THE LIFE
CYCLE OF FERNS --


556
0:39:2,19 --> 0:39:5,5
YEAH, SO BASICALLY YOU CAN'T GET TOO ATTACHED
TO YOUR IDEAS IN


557
0:39:5,5 --> 0:39:9,63
SCIENCE. THEY'RE ALWAYS SUBJECT TO BEING OVERTURNED
WITH


558
0:39:9,63 --> 0:39:16,3
ADDITIONAL DATA. SO LIFE CYCLE OF FERNS IS
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE


559
0:39:16,3 --> 0:39:20,31
SAW IN THE MOSSES. BUT AS I MENTIONED THE
HAPLOID GENERATION IS


560
0:39:20,31 --> 0:39:25,53
RELATIVELY REDUCED, AND THE SPOROPHYTE GENERATION
IS DOMINANT IN


561
0:39:25,53 --> 0:39:30,99
TERMS OF BEING THE, THE CONSPICUOUS AND TYPICALLY
MUCH MORE


562
0:39:30,99 --> 0:39:35,96
LONG-LIVED ORGANISM. HERE YOU CAN SEE THE
SPOROPHYTE GENERATION


563
0:39:35,96 --> 0:39:39,48
IN THE LOWER HALF. THE HAPLOID GENERATION
IN THE UPPER HALF.


564
0:39:39,48 --> 0:39:44,6
SO AGAIN, MEIOSIS RESULTING IN SPORES, HAPLOID
SPORES. AND HERE


565
0:39:44,6 --> 0:39:49,9
YOU CAN SEE A TYPICAL FERN GAMETOPHYTE. AND
THIS IS USUALLY AN


566
0:39:49,9 --> 0:39:54,83
EXTREMELY TINY ORGANISM THAT YOU WOULD EASILY
OVERLOOK UNLESS


567
0:39:54,83 --> 0:39:59,99
YOU'RE DOWN ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES DIGGING
AROUND IN THE SOIL.


568
0:39:59,99 --> 0:40:3,78
AND OFTENTIMES THE FERN GAMETOPHYTE IS HEART-SHAPED
LIKE THIS.


569
0:40:3,78 --> 0:40:9,1
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE. AND THEY'RE OFTEN
PHOTOSYNTHETIC. SOME


570
0:40:9,1 --> 0:40:11,3
OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY FOUND UNDERGROUND AND
THEY DON'T


571
0:40:11,3 --> 0:40:11,3



572
0:40:11,3 --> 0:40:14,849
PHOTOSYNTHESIZE AT ALL. THEY'RE IN ASSOCIATION
WITH MYCORRHIZAL


573
0:40:14,849 --> 0:40:20,18
FUNGI THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER AND GAIN THEIR
NUTRITION THAT WAY.


574
0:40:20,18 --> 0:40:25,25
BUT THEY'RE TINY ORGANISMS. BUT THEY DO PRODUCE
GAMETANGIA.


575
0:40:25,25 --> 0:40:28,4
AND THEY'RE COMMONLY IN THE CASE OF FERNS,
THEY'RE COMMONLY


576
0:40:28,4 --> 0:40:34,27
BISEXUAL OR HERMAPHRODITIC, PRODUCING BOTH
ANTHERIDIA, THE MALE


577
0:40:34,27 --> 0:40:39,27
GAMETANGIUM OR ARCHEGONIA, THE FEMALE GAMETANGIA.
SO WE HAVE


578
0:40:39,27 --> 0:40:43,69
SPERM WHICH, AND AGAIN IN THE FERNS, EVEN
THOUGH THIS IS A REALLY


579
0:40:43,69 --> 0:40:48,45
WIDELY, WIDESPREAD AND DIVERSE GROUP OF PLANTS,
THEY HAVE


580
0:40:48,45 --> 0:40:52,22
FREE-SWIMMING SPERM. THE SPERM HAVE TO SWIM
THROUGH THE OPEN


581
0:40:52,22 --> 0:40:57,609
ENVIRONMENT TO THE NECK OF THE ARCHEGONIUM
AND SWIM DOWN THE NECK


582
0:40:57,609 --> 0:41:3,2
CANAL TO THE, THE CANAL DOWN TO THE EGG AND
FERTILIZE THE EGG.


583
0:41:3,2 --> 0:41:6,71
NOW THERE ARE FERNS THAT YOU FIND IN DESERT
ENVIRONMENTS. AND


584
0:41:6,71 --> 0:41:10,51
SOME OF THESE ARE DESICCATION TOLERANT. THEIR
LEAVES CAN TRY


585
0:41:10,51 --> 0:41:14,4
UP. IN FACT, THAT'S COMMON IN FERNS THAT OCCUR
IN DESERT-LIKE


586
0:41:14,4 --> 0:41:20,7
ENVIRONMENTS. BUT IN GENERAL THOSE DESERT
FERNS ARE STRICTLY


587
0:41:20,7 --> 0:41:26,6
ASEXUAL IN THEIR REPRODUCTION. THIS IS A REALLY
LIMITING BIOLOGY


588
0:41:26,6 --> 0:41:32,43
FOR BEING ABLE TO HAVE SEXUAL REPRODUCTION
IN DRY ENVIRONMENTS.


589
0:41:32,43 --> 0:41:35,74
OKAY, SO THEN WE HAVE FERTILIZATION DOWN INSIDE
THE ARCHEGONIUM


590
0:41:35,74 --> 0:41:39,29
AGAIN LIKE IN THE MOSSES. WE GET A DEVELOPMENT
OF AN EMBRYO


591
0:41:39,29 --> 0:41:43,9
AGAIN. AND HERE'S THE YOUNG SPOROPHYTE, GERMINATING
OUT OF THE


592
0:41:43,9 --> 0:41:48,52
ARCHEGONIUM. AND IT'S ACTUALLY PARASITIC ON
THE GAMETOPHYTE


593
0:41:48,52 --> 0:41:51,66
INITIALLY. BUT THAT DOESN'T LAST LONG. IT
DEVELOPS ITS OWN


594
0:41:51,66 --> 0:41:55,6
ROOT SYSTEM. THE GAMETOPHYTE DOESN'T HAVE
A ROOT ASSIGNMENT.


595
0:41:55,6 --> 0:42:0,99
IT JUST HAS RHIZOIDS, THESE FILAMENTS OF CELLS
THAT ASSOCIATE


596
0:42:0,99 --> 0:42:3,329
WITH THE UPPER SUBSTRATE BUT ARE NOT REALLY
PARTICULARLY


597
0:42:3,329 --> 0:42:3,329



598
0:42:3,329 --> 0:42:7,89
IMPORTANT IN CONDUCTION. BUT THE SPOROPHYTE
DOES HAVE A GOOD


599
0:42:7,89 --> 0:42:13,2
ROOT SYSTEM AS YOU CAN SEE HERE. AND THE SPOROPHYTE
OF FERNS


600
0:42:13,2 --> 0:42:18,579
TYPICALLY HAS ITS STEM UNDERGROUND AS A HORIZONTAL
STEM OR A


601
0:42:18,579 --> 0:42:24,78
RHIZOME. A RHIZOME IS JUST A HORIZONTAL UNDERGROUND
STEM. AND


602
0:42:24,78 --> 0:42:29,38
STEMS PRODUCE LEAVES AS WELL AS IN THIS CASE
ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS


603
0:42:29,38 --> 0:42:32,2
OR ROOTS THAT FORM WHERE THEY NORMALLY WOULDN'T
FROM THE SIDE OF


604
0:42:32,2 --> 0:42:38,359
THE STEM. AND THE LEAVES EMERGE FROM THE GROUND.
AND THE MAIN


605
0:42:38,359 --> 0:42:42,89
FERN BODY THAT WE SEE ABOVE GROUND ARE THE
LEAVES TYPICALLY.


606
0:42:42,89 --> 0:42:49,4
THERE ARE SOME TREE FERNS THAT PRODUCE LONG
STEMS, AERIAL STEMS


607
0:42:49,4 --> 0:42:51,19
THAT CAN GET UP TO SEVERAL METERS IN HEIGHT,
BUT THEY'RE A


608
0:42:51,19 --> 0:42:54,859
MINORITY OF THE FERNS. AND ALSO THERE ARE
THOSE HORSETAILS I


609
0:42:54,859 --> 0:42:58,4
MENTIONED WHICH HAVE AERIAL STEMS THAT ARE
PRETTY BIZARRE THINGS


610
0:42:58,4 --> 0:43:4,26
THAT WERE ONLY RECENTLY RECOGNIZED AS FERNS.
NOW THE SPORANGIA


611
0:43:4,26 --> 0:43:8,6
OF FERNS ARE TYPICALLY, BUT NOT ALWAYS, BUT
TYPICALLY ON THE


612
0:43:8,6 --> 0:43:11,96
UNDERSIDE OF THE LEAF. OR SHELTERED ON THE
UNDERSIDE OF THE


613
0:43:11,96 --> 0:43:16,95
LEAF IN THESE LITTLE CLUSTERS CALLED SORI.
SINGULAR WOULD BE A


614
0:43:16,95 --> 0:43:20,859
SORUS. HERE'S JUST ONE OF SPORANGIA ASSOCIATED
WITH EACH ONE OF


615
0:43:20,859 --> 0:43:27,18
THE SORI. AND IN FERNS THERE'S OFTEN A MECHANISM
THAT ALLOWS FOR


616
0:43:27,18 --> 0:43:32,2
FORCEFUL EJECTION OF THE, OF THE SPORES. AND
MOST FERNS HAVE


617
0:43:32,2 --> 0:43:36,25
THIS CATAPULT-LIKE EJECTION SYSTEM WHERE THE
SPORANGIUM BURSTS


618
0:43:36,25 --> 0:43:39,75
OPEN IN A PARTICULAR WAY AS IT DRIES OUT AND
IT FORCEFULLY


619
0:43:39,75 --> 0:43:45,47
CATAPULTS THESE SPORES. SO THE SPORES ARE
EJECTED AWAY FROM


620
0:43:45,47 --> 0:43:51,57
THE, THE PARENT PLANT. SO THAT'S A NICE DISPERSAL
MECHANISM.


621
0:43:51,57 --> 0:43:55,23
AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THE UNDERSIDE OF A FERN
LEAF. THIS IS A


622
0:43:55,23 --> 0:43:59,3
SWORD FERN WHICH YOU FIND OUT IN REDWOOD FORESTS,
UNDERSTORIES


623
0:43:59,3 --> 0:43:59,119



624
0:43:59,119 --> 0:44:5,109
TYPICALLY. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE INDIVIDUAL
SORI, THESE CIRCULAR


625
0:44:5,109 --> 0:44:9,829
LITTLE BROWN STRUCTURES. HERE'S ONE OF THOSE
ENLARGED. AND YOU


626
0:44:9,829 --> 0:44:13,339
CAN SEE EACH ONE OF THEM IS ASSOCIATED WITH
LARGE NUMBERS OF


627
0:44:13,339 --> 0:44:19,13
SPORANGIA, SO THIS, FOR EXAMPLE, IS A SPORANGIUM,
NOT A SPORE.


628
0:44:19,13 --> 0:44:24,5
EACH ONE OF THESE CONTAINS DOZENS OF SPORES.
SO THERE ARE A


629
0:44:24,5 --> 0:44:27,4
LARGE NUMBER OF SPORES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH
ONE OF THESE


630
0:44:27,4 --> 0:44:30,91
SPORANGIA. IT'S PROTECTED SOMETIMES BY A SHIELD-LIKE
STRUCTURE


631
0:44:30,91 --> 0:44:34,829
HERE WHICH IS AN INDUSIUM. NOT ALL FERNS HAVE
THIS. BUT IT


632
0:44:34,829 --> 0:44:39,17
SERVES TO PROTECT THE DEVELOPING SPORANGIA.
AND IT WITHERS AWAY


633
0:44:39,17 --> 0:44:42,5
WHEN THE SPORES ARE READY TO DISPERSE. IT
GETS OUT OF THE WAY


634
0:44:42,5 --> 0:44:47,47
OF THE DISPERSAL MECHANISM. SO THE SHAPE AND
SIZE AND LOCATION


635
0:44:47,47 --> 0:44:53,63
OF THESE SO-CALLED SORI IS DIAGNOSTIC FOR
DIFFERENT TAXA OF


636
0:44:53,63 --> 0:44:58,109
FERNS. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IF YOU WANT
TO IDENTIFY FERNS,


637
0:44:58,109 --> 0:45:0,29
YOU USUALLY ARE HAVING TO LOOK FOR THEIR SPORANGIA
AND HOW


638
0:45:0,29 --> 0:45:7,99
THEY'RE ARRANGED ON THE LEAVES. OKAY, SO,
WE'RE AT THE POINT


639
0:45:7,99 --> 0:45:12,55
NOW WHERE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO INTRODUCE
THIS CONCEPT OF


640
0:45:12,55 --> 0:45:16,5
HETEROSPORY WHICH JUST MEANS BASICALLY OTHER
SPORES, WHERE


641
0:45:16,5 --> 0:45:20,68
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF SPORE AS OPPOSED
TO HOMOSPORY WHERE


642
0:45:20,68 --> 0:45:26,45
THERE'S ONLY ONE TYPE OF SPORE. AND THE FERN
THAT WE JUST LOOKED


643
0:45:26,45 --> 0:45:30,22
AT, THAT LIFE CYCLE IS HOMOSPOROUS. REMEMBER
THERE WAS JUST ONE


644
0:45:30,22 --> 0:45:34,32
TYPE OF SPORE THAT GAVE RISE TO ONE TYPE OF
GAMETOPHYTE THAT BORE


645
0:45:34,32 --> 0:45:39,2
BOTH TYPES OF GAMETANGIA, BOTH, IT PRODUCED
BOTH SPERM AND EGGS


646
0:45:39,2 --> 0:45:42,869
ON THE SAME INDIVIDUAL. I SHOULD MENTION THAT
FERNS HAVE


647
0:45:42,869 --> 0:45:48,79
DIFFERENTIAL TIMING OF SPERM PRODUCTION AND
EGG PRODUCTION ON THE


648
0:45:48,79 --> 0:45:54,51
SAME GAMETOPHYTE THAT TENDS TO LIMIT SELFING.
OTHERWISE THERE'D


649
0:45:54,51 --> 0:45:54,51



650
0:45:54,51 --> 0:45:59,359
BE POTENTIALLY A LOT OF INBREEDING. BUT THERE
ARE A LOT OF


651
0:45:59,359 --> 0:46:2,7
PLANTS THAT HAVE UNISEXUAL GAMETOPHYTES. AND
I SHOWED YOU A


652
0:46:2,7 --> 0:46:6,609
CASE OF A MOSS THAT DID THAT. IN THE CASE
OF MOSSES WE DON'T


653
0:46:6,609 --> 0:46:10,27
HAVE REALLY DISTINCTIVE SPORE SIZE DIFFERENCES
LIKE WE SEE IN THE


654
0:46:10,27 --> 0:46:14,7
VASCULAR PLANTS. FOR EXAMPLE, SELAGINELLA
SHOWN HERE WHERE WE


655
0:46:14,7 --> 0:46:20,24
HAVE HETEROSPORY, LEADING TO UNISEXUAL GAMETOPHYTES.
THOUGH


656
0:46:20,24 --> 0:46:23,54
SOME OF THE LYCOPHYTES AND A MINORITY OF THE
FERNS, NAMELY THE


657
0:46:23,54 --> 0:46:28,42
WATER FERNS, PRODUCE TWO TYPES OF SPORES.
THIS IS ACTUALLY A


658
0:46:28,42 --> 0:46:34,39
LYCOPHYTE CONE THAT'S BEEN SLICED DOWN THE
MIDDLE LONGITUDINALLY,


659
0:46:34,39 --> 0:46:38,109
RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE SPORANGIA
HERE. ON ONE SIDE


660
0:46:38,109 --> 0:46:41,27
IT'S PRODUCING MICROSPORANGIA WITH ONE TYPE
OF SPORE, THE


661
0:46:41,27 --> 0:46:46,74
MICROSPORES. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE IT'S PRODUCING
MEGASPORANGIA


662
0:46:46,74 --> 0:46:49,93
WITH MEGASPORES WHICH ARE LARGER OBVIOUSLY.
YOU CAN SEE THERE'S


663
0:46:49,93 --> 0:46:53,93
ONLY FOUR PRODUCTS OF MEIOSIS IN ONE OF THESE.
THE FOUR PRODUCTS


664
0:46:53,93 --> 0:46:58,14
OF MEIOSIS ARE THE ONLY SPORES IN ONE OF THESE
SPORANGIA WHEREAS


665
0:46:58,14 --> 0:47:1,74
THERE ARE LARGE NUMBERS OF MICROSPORES HERE.
THOUGH THE


666
0:47:1,74 --> 0:47:8,2
MICROSPORES GERMINATE TO BECOME MALE GAMETOPHYTES
THAT PRODUCE


667
0:47:8,2 --> 0:47:12,67
SPERM, THE MEGASPORES GERMINATE TO BECOME
MEGAGAMETOPHYTES,


668
0:47:12,67 --> 0:47:19,91
FEMALE GAMETOPHYTES THAT PRODUCE EGGS. AND
THAT'S WHAT I'VE


669
0:47:19,91 --> 0:47:24,24
INDICATED HERE. THE HOMOSPORY, THE PRESENCE
OF ONE TYPE OF


670
0:47:24,24 --> 0:47:27,76
SPORE, IS ANCESTRAL IN BOTH THE LYCOPHYTES
AND THE FERNS. AND


671
0:47:27,76 --> 0:47:31,72
HETEROSPORY IS DERIVED IN BOTH GROUPS INDEPENDENTLY.
AND IN


672
0:47:31,72 --> 0:47:35,72
BOTH CASES WHAT WE SEE IS THAT THE GAMETOPHYTES
THAT DEVELOP FROM


673
0:47:35,72 --> 0:47:40,92
THESE DIFFERENT SPORES HAVE ALL OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT
OCCURRING


674
0:47:40,92 --> 0:47:45,2
INSIDE THE SPORE WALL. SO THEY'RE PROTECTED
INSIDE THE SPORE


675
0:47:45,2 --> 0:47:45,2



676
0:47:45,2 --> 0:47:49,2
WALL. AND IT'S ONLY LATE IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT
THAT THEY EMERGE


677
0:47:49,2 --> 0:47:52,46
FROM THE SPORE WALL. SO THERE'S SOME ADDITIONAL
PROTECTION


678
0:47:52,46 --> 0:47:58,7
AFFORDED THESE HETEROSPOROUS GAMETOPHYTES
IN BOTH THE FERNS AND


679
0:47:58,7 --> 0:48:6,609
THE, THE LYCOPHYTES. THOUGH HETEROSPORY MAY
HAVE ARISEN IN PART


680
0:48:6,609 --> 0:48:10,829
AS A MEANS OF PROMOTING OUTCROSSING BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T SELF WITH


681
0:48:10,829 --> 0:48:14,52
YOURSELF OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE ONLY PRODUCING
ONE TYPE OF GAMETE.


682
0:48:14,52 --> 0:48:17,5
BUT IT ALSO MAY HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT FOR PROTECTION
OF THE


683
0:48:17,5 --> 0:48:21,96
GAMETOPHYE GENERATION, THAT VULNERABLE GAMETOPHYTE
GENERATION MAY


684
0:48:21,96 --> 0:48:27,89
BE MORE READILY PROTECTED IN THESE PARTICULAR
TYPE, IN THESE


685
0:48:27,89 --> 0:48:29,7
HETEROSPOROUS LIFE CYCLE. AND WE'LL SEE THIS
TAKEN TO A REAL


686
0:48:29,7 --> 0:48:32,66
EXTREME IN THE SEED PLANTS. AND THAT'S WHY
I'M BOTHERING TO


687
0:48:32,66 --> 0:48:38,22
MENTION IT. IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE AN ESOTERIC
ASIDE RIGHT NOW, BUT


688
0:48:38,22 --> 0:48:42,1
THE SEED PLANTS, ALL OF THEM ARE HETEROSPOROUS,
AND THE EVOLUTION


689
0:48:42,1 --> 0:48:48,13
OF THE SEED WAS, WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF HETEROSPORY.
THOUGH


690
0:48:48,13 --> 0:48:52,72
GETTING BACK TO THE LYCOPHYTES AND FERNS,
EVEN THOUGH TODAY


691
0:48:52,72 --> 0:48:56,25
THEY'RE FAIRLY LOW STATURE PLANTS FOR THE
MOST PART, IF WE GO


692
0:48:56,25 --> 0:48:59,579
BACK TO THE TIME WHEN THE SEED PLANTS WERE
JUST BEGINNING TO


693
0:48:59,579 --> 0:49:4,93
EVOLVE, BACK IN THE LATE PALEOZOIC, ABOUT
300 TO 350 MILLION


694
0:49:4,93 --> 0:49:8,72
YEARS AGO, THE LYCOPHYTES WERE ABSOLUTELY
IMMENSE. HERE'S A


695
0:49:8,72 --> 0:49:14,42
6-FOOT TALL PERSON FOR COMPARISON. HERE'S
A TREE LYCOPHYTE.


696
0:49:14,42 --> 0:49:18,71
AND HERE'S A HORSETAIL, BASICALLY A TREE HORSETAIL.
AND THESE


697
0:49:18,71 --> 0:49:22,68
THINGS DOMINATED THE SO-CALLED COAL FORESTS
OF THE CARBONIFEROUS,


698
0:49:22,68 --> 0:49:28,16
WHICH ARE THE BASIS FOR OUR EXTENSIVE COAL
DEPOSITS WORLDWIDE.


699
0:49:28,16 --> 0:49:31,9
AND THIS WAS A TIME WHEN THERE WAS VERY LOW
TOPOGRAPHY ON EARTH


700
0:49:31,9 --> 0:49:35,16
FOR THE MOST PART. AND TEMPERATURES AT THE
BEGINNING OF THIS


701
0:49:35,16 --> 0:49:35,26



702
0:49:35,26 --> 0:49:39,329
PERIOD WERE VERY WARM AND WET. AND THERE WERE
BOGGY


703
0:49:39,329 --> 0:49:42,77
ENVIRONMENTS WHERE FOSSILIZATION WOULD HAVE
BEEN PROMOTED. ALSO


704
0:49:42,77 --> 0:49:47,69
THESE TREE LYCOPHYTES AND TREE FERNS HAD A
LOT OF LIGNIN IN THEIR


705
0:49:47,69 --> 0:49:52,26
TISSUES WHICH IS ALSO FOUND IN WOOD. BUT PRIMARILY
IN THEIR


706
0:49:52,26 --> 0:49:55,98
BARK, THEY DIDN'T HAVE VERY MUCH WOOD. AND
THIS ALLOWED THEM TO


707
0:49:55,98 --> 0:50:0,79
FOSSILIZE EASILY BECAUSE LIGNIN'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO DECOMPOSE AND


708
0:50:0,79 --> 0:50:3,51
THERE MAY NOT HAVE EVEN BEEN THE APPROPRIATE
DECOMPOSERS AT THIS


709
0:50:3,51 --> 0:50:10,92
TIME. OKAY, SO WE'LL GET INTO SEED PLANTS
NEXT TIME. AND


710
0:50:10,92 --> 0:50:14,4
YOU'LL START TO SEE THESE IN LAB THIS WEEK.


711
0:50:14,4 --> 0:52:14,4
