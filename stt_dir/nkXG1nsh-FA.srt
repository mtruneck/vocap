People say, where do you think
your project fits within this


3
0:0:19,3 --> 0:0:20,525
greater discussion about
gun control?

0:0:24,281 --> 0:0:27,58
If we could print a gun, other
people could do this.


6
0:0:27,58 --> 0:0:29,76
Like what if we gave it away,
open source style?


7
0:0:29,76 --> 0:0:32,33
What would that mean?


8
0:0:32,33 --> 0:0:35,19
Gun control, for us,
is a fantasy.


9
0:0:35,19 --> 0:0:37,71
In a way that like people say,
you're being unrealistic about


10
0:0:37,71 --> 0:0:38,41
printing a gun.


11
0:0:38,41 --> 0:0:41,45
I think it's more unrealistic
now, especially going forward,


12
0:0:41,45 --> 0:0:44,18
to think you could ever control
this technology.


13
0:0:44,18 --> 0:0:47,435
The only things recognized and
promulgated in this culture


14
0:0:47,435 --> 0:0:48,87
are irreversible.


15
0:0:48,87 --> 0:0:53,23
To have a symbolic gift like the
printable gun does so much


16
0:0:53,23 --> 0:0:56,39
ideological damage and violence
to these ideas.


17
0:0:56,39 --> 0:1:1,22
Simply that, like, it
can't be ignored.
