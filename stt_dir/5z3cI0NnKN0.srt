Please welcome Sarah
Silverman.


16
0:1:26,19 --> 0:1:42,277



17
0:1:42,277 --> 0:1:45,271
SARAH SILVERMAN: Come on,
there's a lot of show.


18
0:1:45,271 --> 0:1:49,263
There's a lot of show,
all right?


19
0:1:49,263 --> 0:1:50,261
Hey, everybody.


20
0:1:50,261 --> 0:1:53,6
It's me, your friendly
neighborhood Sarah Silverman.


21
0:1:53,6 --> 0:1:59,1
And I'm here to say,
welcome to the


22
0:1:59,1 --> 0:2:1,3
Internet, the Wild West.


23
0:2:1,3 --> 0:2:2,83
You always hear people
say that, right?


24
0:2:2,83 --> 0:2:4,55
The Internet is like
the Wild West.


25
0:2:4,55 --> 0:2:6,33
That's because it
is, all right?


26
0:2:6,33 --> 0:2:8,66
It's totally unregulated.


27
0:2:8,66 --> 0:2:11,38
So I thought it would be cool
to see just how far we could


28
0:2:11,38 --> 0:2:14,596
go without any consequences.


29
0:2:14,596 --> 0:2:18,354
What do you think?


30
0:2:18,354 --> 0:2:21,246
All right.


31
0:2:21,246 --> 0:2:24,87
Well, for starters, I know that
it's highly illegal to


32
0:2:24,87 --> 0:2:27,38
impersonate a federal
employee, all right?


33
0:2:27,38 --> 0:2:30,6
Oh shit, look at me.


34
0:2:30,6 --> 0:2:33,644
I am a mail man, you guys.


35
0:2:33,644 --> 0:2:36,57
I swear to God.


36
0:2:36,57 --> 0:2:38,59
I swear to God, I
am a mail man.


37
0:2:38,59 --> 0:2:42,4
I deliver mail for the United
States Postal Service.


38
0:2:42,4 --> 0:2:46,725
I cover the 03110 zip code of
Bedford, New Hampshire.


39
0:2:46,725 --> 0:2:51,965
And oh shit, look at this,
special delivery, y'all.


40
0:2:51,965 --> 0:2:52,955
Candy.


41
0:2:52,955 --> 0:2:54,935
Looks like Snickers.


42
0:2:54,935 --> 0:3:0,875
[APPLAUSE]


43
0:3:0,875 --> 0:3:1,865
SETH ROGEN: How's it going?


44
0:3:1,865 --> 0:3:2,855
Good to see you.


45
0:3:2,855 --> 0:3:3,845
SARAH SILVERMAN: What's up?


46
0:3:3,845 --> 0:3:4,36
SETH ROGEN: I want in on this.


47
0:3:4,36 --> 0:3:5,124
This looks fun.


48
0:3:5,124 --> 0:3:6,84
I want in on this action.


49
0:3:6,84 --> 0:3:7,79
SARAH SILVERMAN: Yeah,
let's do it.


50
0:3:7,79 --> 0:3:8,265
SETH ROGEN: Yeah.


51
0:3:8,265 --> 0:3:8,74
I need in.


52
0:3:8,74 --> 0:3:9,215
I want in.


53
0:3:9,215 --> 0:3:11,115
SARAH SILVERMAN: What
do you got?


54
0:3:11,115 --> 0:3:13,15
SETH ROGEN: Tell you
what I've got.


55
0:3:13,15 --> 0:3:16,9
I got a bootlegged copy,
pirated, "Star Trek Into


56
0:3:16,9 --> 0:3:20,1
Darkness." If the FBI knows we
watched this, we get five


57
0:3:20,1 --> 0:3:21,32
years right away.


58
0:3:21,32 --> 0:3:22,26
Let's watch this.


59
0:3:22,26 --> 0:3:23,2
SARAH SILVERMAN: Let's do it.


60
0:3:23,2 --> 0:3:24,45
SETH ROGEN: Nice.


61
0:3:24,45 --> 0:3:26,49



62
0:3:26,49 --> 0:3:29,95
Let's shove it in there.


63
0:3:29,95 --> 0:3:29,54
SARAH SILVERMAN: Perfect.


64
0:3:29,54 --> 0:3:30,99
SETH ROGEN: Sure, boom.


65
0:3:30,99 --> 0:3:32,38
SARAH SILVERMAN: All
right, it's in.


66
0:3:32,38 --> 0:3:33,512
SETH ROGEN: OK, Play.


67
0:3:33,512 --> 0:3:35,25
Nice, it's working.


68
0:3:35,25 --> 0:3:36,35
I love this.


69
0:3:36,35 --> 0:3:37,65
Greatest logo ever.


70
0:3:37,65 --> 0:3:38,602
Here we go.


71
0:3:38,602 --> 0:3:39,61
SARAH SILVERMAN: Bad Robot!


72
0:3:39,61 --> 0:3:40,772
SETH ROGEN: Oh, it's working.


73
0:3:40,772 --> 0:3:42,36
This is great.


74
0:3:42,36 --> 0:3:45,192
Fucking eat my dick, FBI.


75
0:3:45,192 --> 0:3:47,18
SARAH SILVERMAN: Well
said, friend-o.


76
0:3:47,18 --> 0:3:48,11
SETH ROGEN: Thank
you very much.


77
0:3:48,11 --> 0:3:49,28
This is so much much.


78
0:3:49,28 --> 0:3:49,91
What else can we do?


79
0:3:49,91 --> 0:3:51,11
It's so much fun.


80
0:3:51,11 --> 0:3:52,45
SARAH SILVERMAN: Yeah,
of course it's fun.


81
0:3:52,45 --> 0:3:54,71
It's like we can do
anything here.


82
0:3:54,71 --> 0:3:56,55
It's delicious cyber anarchy.


83
0:3:56,55 --> 0:3:57,26
SETH ROGEN: It really is.


84
0:3:57,26 --> 0:3:58,91
ARMEN WEITZMAN: Here's your
coffee, Mrs. Silverman.


85
0:3:58,91 --> 0:4:0,23
SARAH SILVERMAN: Oh,
thank you, Armen.


86
0:4:0,23 --> 0:4:0,545
ARMEN WEITZMAN: Thanks.


87
0:4:0,545 --> 0:4:3,83
SARAH SILVERMAN: Armen, wait,
let me give you a tip.


88
0:4:3,83 --> 0:4:6,13
ARMEN WEITZMAN: Oh,
thank you, a tip.


89
0:4:6,13 --> 0:4:7,3
SARAH SILVERMAN: You're
a good guy, right?


90
0:4:7,3 --> 0:4:7,835
ARMEN WEITZMAN: Yeah.


91
0:4:7,835 --> 0:4:9,88
SARAH SILVERMAN: You're a
sweet heart of a guy.


92
0:4:9,88 --> 0:4:10,952
ARMEN WEITZMAN: Thank you.


93
0:4:10,952 --> 0:4:11,29
SARAH SILVERMAN: Eat it.


94
0:4:11,29 --> 0:4:12,864
Eat a fucking dick.


95
0:4:12,864 --> 0:4:13,84
SETH ROGEN: Oh my God!


96
0:4:13,84 --> 0:4:15,304
SARAH SILVERMAN: Eat
a fucking dick.


97
0:4:15,304 --> 0:4:16,768
SETH ROGEN: Oh God.


98
0:4:16,768 --> 0:4:19,208
Oh Jesus!


99
0:4:19,208 --> 0:4:21,209
SARAH SILVERMAN: Eat
a dick, FBI!


100
0:4:21,209 --> 0:4:24,534
SETH ROGEN: No, no, no, no.


101
0:4:24,534 --> 0:4:25,959
Jesus, Sarah, no.


102
0:4:25,959 --> 0:4:26,92
SARAH SILVERMAN: Suck my dick!


103
0:4:26,92 --> 0:4:28,58
SETH ROGEN: No, the FBI
should not eat a dick.


104
0:4:28,58 --> 0:4:29,26
He's dead.


105
0:4:29,26 --> 0:4:31,8
You just killed a production
assistant.


106
0:4:31,8 --> 0:4:32,14
SARAH SILVERMAN: Oh,
what is this? "The


107
0:4:32,14 --> 0:4:34,4
Guild Trip" part deux?


108
0:4:34,4 --> 0:4:35,43
SETH ROGEN: OK, ha ha ha.


109
0:4:35,43 --> 0:4:37,37
SARAH SILVERMAN: What is
this? "The Guilt Trip"


110
0:4:37,37 --> 0:4:39,12
too boring too watch?


111
0:4:39,12 --> 0:4:40,99
SETH ROGEN: OK, Sarah,
I'm serious.


112
0:4:40,99 --> 0:4:42,21
Jesus Christ.


113
0:4:42,21 --> 0:4:43,31
A man is dead now.


114
0:4:43,31 --> 0:4:44,29
SARAH SILVERMAN: (MOCKING)
A man is--


115
0:4:44,29 --> 0:4:45,54
SETH ROGEN: He's dead.


116
0:4:45,54 --> 0:4:48,532



117
0:4:48,532 --> 0:4:49,99
SARAH SILVERMAN: Oh.


118
0:4:49,99 --> 0:4:51,774
Oh my God.


119
0:4:51,774 --> 0:4:52,66
SETH ROGEN: Yeah.


120
0:4:52,66 --> 0:4:53,802
SARAH SILVERMAN: Oh no.


121
0:4:53,802 --> 0:4:55,1
Oh no.


122
0:4:55,1 --> 0:4:57,242
Fuck, oh shit, kid, wake up.


123
0:4:57,242 --> 0:4:58,676
Oh God.


124
0:4:58,676 --> 0:4:59,64
I'm sorry.


125
0:4:59,64 --> 0:5:0,486
SETH ROGEN: Oh, Jesus.


126
0:5:0,486 --> 0:5:1,974
That's not going to--


127
0:5:1,974 --> 0:5:2,94
SARAH SILVERMAN: Why
are you bleeding?


128
0:5:2,94 --> 0:5:3,396
Oh fuck.


129
0:5:3,396 --> 0:5:4,764
SETH ROGEN: It's not
going to work.


130
0:5:4,764 --> 0:5:6,542
I have to call the
cops now, Sarah.


131
0:5:6,542 --> 0:5:7,69
I've got to--


132
0:5:7,69 --> 0:5:8,95
SARAH SILVERMAN: No.


133
0:5:8,95 --> 0:5:8,5
No.


134
0:5:8,5 --> 0:5:9,56
Don't call the cops.


135
0:5:9,56 --> 0:5:10,14
SETH ROGEN: I have
to call the cops.


136
0:5:10,14 --> 0:5:10,58
SARAH SILVERMAN: No.


137
0:5:10,58 --> 0:5:12,34
Then I have to do this.


138
0:5:12,34 --> 0:5:13,89
SETH ROGEN: No, Sarah,
don't, don't.


139
0:5:13,89 --> 0:5:14,0
Chill out.


140
0:5:14,0 --> 0:5:15,48
Don't do something you'll
regret, OK?


141
0:5:15,48 --> 0:5:17,487
SARAH SILVERMAN: Oh, don't
do something I'll regret?


142
0:5:17,487 --> 0:5:17,954
SETH ROGEN: Yes.


143
0:5:17,954 --> 0:5:19,355
SARAH SILVERMAN: Don't do
something I'll regret?


144
0:5:19,355 --> 0:5:20,637
Seth, don't you think it's a
little too fucking late for


145
0:5:20,637 --> 0:5:24,712
that, you graveling, throw
it in, laughing fuck?


146
0:5:24,712 --> 0:5:31,46
[YELLING]


147
0:5:31,46 --> 0:5:33,56
SETH ROGEN: Sarah,
oh, you cunt!


148
0:5:33,56 --> 0:5:38,18



149
0:5:38,18 --> 0:5:39,1
SARAH SILVERMAN: Whoa.


150
0:5:39,1 --> 0:5:40,23
That stung.


151
0:5:40,23 --> 0:5:42,701
That really--


152
0:5:42,701 --> 0:5:47,6
you know, it's just
so misogynistic.


153
0:5:47,6 --> 0:5:49,25
I guess everybody has like
their trigger words?


154
0:5:49,25 --> 0:5:51,133
That was my trigger word.


155
0:5:51,133 --> 0:5:52,92
SETH ROGEN: Well, I'm sorry.


156
0:5:52,92 --> 0:5:54,25
I guess I'm sorry, OK?


157
0:5:54,25 --> 0:5:55,7
SARAH SILVERMAN: No problem.


158
0:5:55,7 --> 0:5:56,63
Listen, we're here testing
boundaries.


159
0:5:56,63 --> 0:5:57,57
That's what we're here for.


160
0:5:57,57 --> 0:6:0,54
And I guess we found our
ceiling, you know?


161
0:6:0,54 --> 0:6:3,4
SETH ROGEN: The ceiling
is cunt.


162
0:6:3,4 --> 0:6:4,62
The cunt ceiling.


163
0:6:4,62 --> 0:6:5,55
SARAH SILVERMAN: Infamous
cunt ceiling.


164
0:6:5,55 --> 0:6:8,45
SETH ROGEN: The cunt ceiling.


165
0:6:8,45 --> 0:6:9,293
Oh, shit.


166
0:6:9,293 --> 0:6:10,4
SARAH SILVERMAN: Oh God.


167
0:6:10,4 --> 0:6:11,0
Well, now we know.


168
0:6:11,0 --> 0:6:12,736
And I'm so sorry
I stabbed you.


169
0:6:12,736 --> 0:6:13,648
That was shitty.


170
0:6:13,648 --> 0:6:14,99
SETH ROGEN: It's OK.


171
0:6:14,99 --> 0:6:17,84
At least you didn't slit my
throat and kill me, you know?


172
0:6:17,84 --> 0:6:18,85
SARAH SILVERMAN: Good point.


173
0:6:18,85 --> 0:6:19,54
SETH ROGEN: Good point.


174
0:6:19,54 --> 0:6:23,852
I think you made the good point
into his trachea, right?


175
0:6:23,852 --> 0:6:25,683
SARAH SILVERMAN: You are so
good with world play.


176
0:6:25,683 --> 0:6:26,65
SETH ROGEN: Thank you.


177
0:6:26,65 --> 0:6:27,602
I try, I try.


178
0:6:27,602 --> 0:6:28,26
SARAH SILVERMAN: I'm so
glad we're friends.


179
0:6:28,26 --> 0:6:28,9
SETH ROGEN: I am too, Sarah.


180
0:6:28,9 --> 0:6:29,68
This is great.


181
0:6:29,68 --> 0:6:31,38
What do you say we get the
show started, huh?


182
0:6:31,38 --> 0:6:32,344
SARAH SILVERMAN: Great
idea, Seth.


183
0:6:32,344 --> 0:6:33,31
SETH ROGEN: Awesome.


184
0:6:33,31 --> 0:6:36,165
SARAH SILVERMAN: Ladies and
gentlemen, hold in all your


185
0:6:36,165 --> 0:6:39,1
pee and poo and put your hands
together for the world's


186
0:6:39,1 --> 0:6:41,88

187
0:6:41,88 --> 0:6:43,875

188
0:6:43,875 --> 0:6:48,156



189
0:6:48,156 --> 0:6:50,124
THE LONELY ISLAND: We've been
here for a minute now.


190
0:6:50,124 --> 0:6:52,584
This some grown man shit.


191
0:6:52,584 --> 0:6:53,568
I've got that diaper money.


192
0:6:53,568 --> 0:6:55,536
I've got that diaper
money, dude.


193
0:6:55,536 --> 0:6:56,52
I've got that diaper money.


194
0:6:56,52 --> 0:6:57,996
I'm a grown ass man.


195
0:6:57,996 --> 0:7:1,932
I know I got that diaper money
'cause my kids need to shit.


196
0:7:1,932 --> 0:7:4,884
So I stay on my hustle to keep
my pocketbook thick.


197
0:7:4,884 --> 0:7:6,524
I got papers and papers
and papes all


198
0:7:6,524 --> 0:7:7,344
for my baby's mistakes.


199
0:7:7,344 --> 0:7:9,36
Just sold my car for
some drapes.


200
0:7:9,36 --> 0:7:10,8
Don't get shit on 'em.


201
0:7:10,8 --> 0:7:11,49
I've got that diaper money.


202
0:7:11,49 --> 0:7:13,37
I've got that diaper
money, dude.


203
0:7:13,37 --> 0:7:14,78
I've got that diaper money.


204
0:7:14,78 --> 0:7:16,3
I'm a grown ass man.


205
0:7:16,3 --> 0:7:19,4



206
0:7:19,4 --> 0:7:20,17
I've got that wife pussy.


207
0:7:20,17 --> 0:7:21,841
I've got that wife pussy.


208
0:7:21,841 --> 0:7:23,194
I've got that wife pussy.


209
0:7:23,194 --> 0:7:25,955
I've got that pussy on lock.


210
0:7:25,955 --> 0:7:28,236
I've got that wife pussy
on lock 24/7.


211
0:7:28,236 --> 0:7:31,624
Whenever she lets me, I'm
in same pussy heaven.


212
0:7:31,624 --> 0:7:34,56
And the best part about it is
no one else can have it.


213
0:7:34,56 --> 0:7:37,899
And also, I can't have it,
unless she says I can.


214
0:7:37,899 --> 0:7:40,737
See a girl on the street, man,
I can't, so I won't.


215
0:7:40,737 --> 0:7:43,65
See my wife at home, and I
would, but she hates my guts.


216
0:7:43,65 --> 0:7:45,796
Wife pussy, I've got
that wife pussy.


217
0:7:45,796 --> 0:7:47,53
I've got that wife pussy.


218
0:7:47,53 --> 0:7:49,22
I've got that pussy on lock.


219
0:7:49,22 --> 0:7:51,94



220
0:7:51,94 --> 0:7:53,362
I've got that grave plot.


221
0:7:53,362 --> 0:7:54,784
I've got that grave plot.


222
0:7:54,784 --> 0:7:56,68
I've got that grave plot.


223
0:7:56,68 --> 0:7:58,58
It's right off the highway.


224
0:7:58,58 --> 0:8:1,702
Wobbedy wobbedy wobbedy drop
into my grave plot.


225
0:8:1,702 --> 0:8:3,63
You afraid of death?


226
0:8:3,63 --> 0:8:4,594
Well, I'm afraid not.


227
0:8:4,594 --> 0:8:7,486
Because I got the bomb spot
right off the highway.


228
0:8:7,486 --> 0:8:11,824
I did it my way, a very small
percent of the dime way.


229
0:8:11,824 --> 0:8:13,673
I've got my coffin picked out.


230
0:8:13,673 --> 0:8:16,56
Styrofoam painted like
wood, tricked out.


231
0:8:16,56 --> 0:8:19,16
It's even got handles
to lower me smooth.


232
0:8:19,16 --> 0:8:22,27
And my tombstone only
has minimal typos.


233
0:8:22,27 --> 0:8:24,41
Grave plot, I've got
that grave plot.


234
0:8:24,41 --> 0:8:28,4
I've got that grave plot,
right next to my dad.


235
0:8:28,4 --> 0:8:29,585
I've got that diaper money.


236
0:8:29,585 --> 0:8:30,787
I've got that wife pussy.


237
0:8:30,787 --> 0:8:32,278
I've got that grave plot.


238
0:8:32,278 --> 0:8:36,751
I'm a grown ass man.


239
0:8:36,751 --> 0:8:41,224
[APPLAUSE]


240
0:8:41,224 --> 0:8:43,212
All right, spring break, do
you know what time it is?


241
0:8:43,212 --> 0:8:45,697
I'm going to need all the
hot girls to come on


242
0:8:45,697 --> 0:8:46,691
the stage right now.


243
0:8:46,691 --> 0:8:49,176
Fellas, let me hear you
make some noise.


244
0:8:49,176 --> 0:8:53,386



245
0:8:53,386 --> 0:8:56,805
Kings of the pussy, pounding
on brewskies.


246
0:8:56,805 --> 0:8:59,691
Banging chicks right
there in the sand.


247
0:8:59,691 --> 0:9:4,2
Bros before hoes and chicks with
no clothes and slamming


248
0:9:4,2 --> 0:9:7,765
shots and marry a man.


249
0:9:7,765 --> 0:9:8,99
Who wanna do a shot?


250
0:9:8,99 --> 0:9:9,39
We do.


251
0:9:9,39 --> 0:9:10,19
I'm going to get fucked up.


252
0:9:10,19 --> 0:9:10,79
Me too.


253
0:9:10,79 --> 0:9:11,42
We came for a week.


254
0:9:11,42 --> 0:9:12,74
We the kings of the beach.


255
0:9:12,74 --> 0:9:14,225
T-shirt, see through.


256
0:9:14,225 --> 0:9:15,71
Cancun, party down.


257
0:9:15,71 --> 0:9:17,195
Lauderdale, another round.


258
0:9:17,195 --> 0:9:18,68
Havasu, crack a brew.


259
0:9:18,68 --> 0:9:20,165
Marry a man.


260
0:9:20,165 --> 0:9:23,63
Cranks when you're passed out,
jokes about roofies.


261
0:9:23,63 --> 0:9:26,105
Making girls kiss,
marry a man.


262
0:9:26,105 --> 0:9:30,65
Giant sombreros, show
us your titties.


263
0:9:30,65 --> 0:9:34,52
Creatine shakes, marry a man.


264
0:9:34,52 --> 0:9:36,5
Oh shit, I'm too fucked up.


265
0:9:36,5 --> 0:9:37,745
Puke and rally, that's
what's up.


266
0:9:37,745 --> 0:9:39,6
Booze cruise, raise
your glass.


267
0:9:39,6 --> 0:9:41,5
Snort that coke off her ass.


268
0:9:41,5 --> 0:9:43,98
Two chicks at the dance hall,
take it to the dance stall.


269
0:9:43,98 --> 0:9:47,386
Trade these beads
for their bras.


270
0:9:47,386 --> 0:9:50,62
So-Co in my canteen, got girls
jumping on trampoline.


271
0:9:50,62 --> 0:9:53,428
Two men bound by the law.


272
0:9:53,428 --> 0:9:56,914
Trashy motel rooms, clogging
up toilets.


273
0:9:56,914 --> 0:9:59,404
Beer goggles if she's a hag.


274
0:9:59,404 --> 0:10:2,89
Planning the menu, picking
out flowers.


275
0:10:2,89 --> 0:10:5,878
Nailing sluts and writing
our vows.


276
0:10:5,878 --> 0:10:8,368
Down here, it's our time.


277
0:10:8,368 --> 0:10:13,846
Spring breakers, let's
get fucked up.


278
0:10:13,846 --> 0:10:18,826
Then find Mr. Right and
get monogamous.


279
0:10:18,826 --> 0:10:22,81
Picking our invite font as a
twosome, something tasteful


280
0:10:22,81 --> 0:10:24,802
but not too bland.


281
0:10:24,802 --> 0:10:28,786
Seating arrangements, charming
the in-laws.


282
0:10:28,786 --> 0:10:31,276
Ripping beer pong,
sex with a man.


283
0:10:31,276 --> 0:10:34,762
We'll be so happy, true
love forever.


284
0:10:34,762 --> 0:10:37,75
Two kings walking
hand in hand.


285
0:10:37,75 --> 0:10:42,232
Promise to cherish, trust, and
respect him, crushing pussy,


286
0:10:42,232 --> 0:10:44,81
marry a man.


287
0:10:44,81 --> 0:10:48,874
Spring break.


288
0:10:48,874 --> 0:10:50,124
T-Pain.


289
0:10:50,124 --> 0:10:53,302



290
0:10:53,302 --> 0:10:54,796
Aw, shit.


291
0:10:54,796 --> 0:10:56,788
Get your tails ready.


292
0:10:56,788 --> 0:10:59,278
It's about to go down.


293
0:10:59,278 --> 0:11:2,266
Everybody in the front
to the fucking deck.


294
0:11:2,266 --> 0:11:5,254
Stand on your motherfucking
toes.


295
0:11:5,254 --> 0:11:7,246
We running this, let's go.


296
0:11:7,246 --> 0:11:7,744
I'm on a bat.


297
0:11:7,744 --> 0:11:9,736
I'm on a boat, everybody.


298
0:11:9,736 --> 0:11:12,724
Look at me, 'cause I'm
sailing on a boat.


299
0:11:12,724 --> 0:11:14,218
I'm on a boat.


300
0:11:14,218 --> 0:11:15,712
I'm on a boat.


301
0:11:15,712 --> 0:11:18,202
Take a good, hard look at
the motherfucking boat.


302
0:11:18,202 --> 0:11:19,198
T-PAIN: Yeah, yeah.


303
0:11:19,198 --> 0:11:23,182
I never thought I'd
be on a boat.


304
0:11:23,182 --> 0:11:26,668
It's a big, blue watery road.


305
0:11:26,668 --> 0:11:30,68
Poseidon, look at me.


306
0:11:30,68 --> 0:11:32,902
THE LONELY ISLAND: All
hands on deck.


307
0:11:32,902 --> 0:11:37,384
T-PAIN: I never thought I'd see
the day when a big boat


308
0:11:37,384 --> 0:11:39,376
coming my way.


309
0:11:39,376 --> 0:11:45,352
Believe me when I say,
I fucked a mermaid.


310
0:11:45,352 --> 0:11:46,348
THE LONELY ISLAND:
I'm on a boat.


311
0:11:46,348 --> 0:11:47,344
I'm on a boat.


312
0:11:47,344 --> 0:11:50,83
Everybody look at me, because
I'm sailing on a boat.


313
0:11:50,83 --> 0:11:52,822
I'm on a boat.


314
0:11:52,822 --> 0:11:53,818
I'm on a boat.


315
0:11:53,818 --> 0:11:56,806
So take a good, hard look at
the motherfucking boat.


316
0:11:56,806 --> 0:12:2,782



317
0:12:2,782 --> 0:12:7,762
[APPLAUSE]


318
0:12:7,762 --> 0:12:24,196



319
0:12:24,196 --> 0:12:25,925
FATAL FARM: No thanks,
no thank you.


320
0:12:25,925 --> 0:12:26,83
MALE SPEAKER: I do a
really good job.


321
0:12:26,83 --> 0:12:28,58
FATAL FARM: Really, I'm
not interested.


322
0:12:28,58 --> 0:12:34,54



323
0:12:34,54 --> 0:12:35,79
OK?


324
0:12:35,79 --> 0:12:45,349



325
0:12:45,349 --> 0:12:51,836
[ENGINE REVS]


326
0:12:51,836 --> 0:13:14,79



327
0:13:14,79 --> 0:13:16,786
He just flew away.


328
0:13:16,786 --> 0:13:22,774



329
0:13:22,774 --> 0:13:24,82
KYLE MOONEY: This next act,
no, this next act isn't--


330
0:13:24,82 --> 0:13:25,61
oh, sorry.


331
0:13:25,61 --> 0:13:28,13
I messed up.


332
0:13:28,13 --> 0:13:32,6
You know, this next act isn't
what I had for breakfast.


333
0:13:32,6 --> 0:13:34,6
It's Garfunkel and Oates.


334
0:13:34,6 --> 0:13:36,682



335
0:13:36,682 --> 0:13:38,45
I didn't know if that--
was it still me?


336
0:13:38,45 --> 0:13:42,975



337
0:13:42,975 --> 0:13:45,41
GARFUNKEL AND OATES: Hi.


338
0:13:45,41 --> 0:13:47,834
What's up, guys, how are you?


339
0:13:47,834 --> 0:13:50,57



340
0:13:50,57 --> 0:13:54,78
So in this song, we play the
same woman two years apart.


341
0:13:54,78 --> 0:13:55,74
I'm 29.


342
0:13:55,74 --> 0:13:57,2
And I'm 31.


343
0:13:57,2 --> 0:14:0,52
So same woman, two years apart,
singing about love.


344
0:14:0,52 --> 0:14:4,77
This song is called 29 31.


345
0:14:4,77 --> 0:14:6,98
For the first time in my
life, I see it clearly.


346
0:14:6,98 --> 0:14:9,48
I realize the power
of being a woman.


347
0:14:9,48 --> 0:14:11,75
29 years old and time's
on my side.


348
0:14:11,75 --> 0:14:12,63
I'm in my prime.


349
0:14:12,63 --> 0:14:13,47
I've hit my stride.


350
0:14:13,47 --> 0:14:15,91
I've got so much charisma
and so many options.


351
0:14:15,91 --> 0:14:17,71
It's nice to always
have my pick.


352
0:14:17,71 --> 0:14:19,646
There's nobody left.


353
0:14:19,646 --> 0:14:21,98
I'm all alone.


354
0:14:21,98 --> 0:14:29,326



355
0:14:29,326 --> 0:14:30,68
I'm at the top of my game.


356
0:14:30,68 --> 0:14:31,9
Possibilities are endless.


357
0:14:31,9 --> 0:14:33,97
And I just feel really pretty.


358
0:14:33,97 --> 0:14:36,0
I'm holding out for someone
who meets my standards.


359
0:14:36,0 --> 0:14:38,24
Won't settle for anything
less than perfect.


360
0:14:38,24 --> 0:14:39,25
I know what I want.


361
0:14:39,25 --> 0:14:40,17
And I can have it.


362
0:14:40,17 --> 0:14:41,97
I'm surrounded by
love and peace.


363
0:14:41,97 --> 0:14:43,91
There's nobody left.


364
0:14:43,91 --> 0:14:46,82
I'm all alone.


365
0:14:46,82 --> 0:14:47,49
Why did I wait?


366
0:14:47,49 --> 0:14:48,58
What's wrong with me?


367
0:14:48,58 --> 0:14:50,91
In two short years, I'm
going to be 33.


368
0:14:50,91 --> 0:14:51,66
Who the hell will
want me then?


369
0:14:51,66 --> 0:14:52,77
My ovaries are shrinking.


370
0:14:52,77 --> 0:14:54,775
I'm disgusting and everyone
feels bad for me.


371
0:14:54,775 --> 0:14:59,14
And I never get invited to
dinner parties anymore.


372
0:14:59,14 --> 0:15:1,3
Things unfold when they're
supposed to, because


373
0:15:1,3 --> 0:15:3,32
everything happens
for a reason.


374
0:15:3,32 --> 0:15:5,7
It'll happen for me when
I'm not even looking.


375
0:15:5,7 --> 0:15:7,34
He'll just appear, and
I'll just know.


376
0:15:7,34 --> 0:15:9,37
And he'll love me forever
without any work.


377
0:15:9,37 --> 0:15:11,815
Who needs to try when things
are meant to be?


378
0:15:11,815 --> 0:15:13,9
There's nobody left.


379
0:15:13,9 --> 0:15:14,38
I'm a catch, just look at me.


380
0:15:14,38 --> 0:15:15,46
I'm all alone.


381
0:15:15,46 --> 0:15:17,356
You're such a fucking idiot.


382
0:15:17,356 --> 0:15:19,452
You think you're so special
because people tell you that


383
0:15:19,452 --> 0:15:20,99
now, but that'll stop when
they're replaced


384
0:15:20,99 --> 0:15:21,59
with looks of pity.


385
0:15:21,59 --> 0:15:22,22
My life complete.


386
0:15:22,22 --> 0:15:24,76
The world is a buffet of love.


387
0:15:24,76 --> 0:15:25,33
Oh, what?


388
0:15:25,33 --> 0:15:27,85
You think biological reality
doesn't apply to you in your


389
0:15:27,85 --> 0:15:29,2
adorable cocoon of
agelessness?


390
0:15:29,2 --> 0:15:30,4
Well, it does.


391
0:15:30,4 --> 0:15:32,66
While you're just waiting around
and focusing on you,


392
0:15:32,66 --> 0:15:33,6
guess what?


393
0:15:33,6 --> 0:15:35,95
You're going to miss your
fucking window.


394
0:15:35,95 --> 0:15:38,77



395
0:15:38,77 --> 0:15:40,6
Everything happens
for a reason.


396
0:15:40,6 --> 0:15:41,96
You know I truly believe that.


397
0:15:41,96 --> 0:15:43,41
Yeah, you said that before.


398
0:15:43,41 --> 0:15:44,88
Oh my God, it does though.


399
0:15:44,88 --> 0:15:46,48
Everything happens
for a reason.


400
0:15:46,48 --> 0:15:48,97
What about the Haitian
earthquake or cellulite on


401
0:15:48,97 --> 0:15:49,29
skinny women?


402
0:15:49,29 --> 0:15:50,63
Just say, hey universe,
I'm ready.


403
0:15:50,63 --> 0:15:52,53
It'll happen when you
least expect it.


404
0:15:52,53 --> 0:15:54,3
Well, I don't expect
it at all now.


405
0:15:54,3 --> 0:15:55,97
So I guess it's right
around the corner.


406
0:15:55,97 --> 0:15:57,42
Maybe you're putting
out the wrong vibe.


407
0:15:57,42 --> 0:15:59,28
Maybe you're closed
off to love.


408
0:15:59,28 --> 0:16:0,56
Let me tell you a secret.


409
0:16:0,56 --> 0:16:1,6
It's called the secret.


410
0:16:1,6 --> 0:16:2,34
There's another secret.


411
0:16:2,34 --> 0:16:3,59
You're an asshole.


412
0:16:3,59 --> 0:16:5,5



413
0:16:5,5 --> 0:16:7,51
Your negativity is a
self-fulfilling prophecy.


414
0:16:7,51 --> 0:16:9,9
The reason things go well for
me is because of positivity.


415
0:16:9,9 --> 0:16:12,15
Well, I'm positive fertility
always begins to atrophy when


416
0:16:12,15 --> 0:16:13,3
infantile fantasy eclipses
true reality.


417
0:16:13,3 --> 0:16:14,74
It never once occurred
to me that things


418
0:16:14,74 --> 0:16:15,49
won't work out perfectly.


419
0:16:15,49 --> 0:16:19,28
When God closes a door, you
see, he opens a window.


420
0:16:19,28 --> 0:16:22,27
You realize that's a smaller
opening, right?


421
0:16:22,27 --> 0:16:23,746
You used to just be able to walk
out a door, and now you


422
0:16:23,746 --> 0:16:25,36
have to climb out some
slightly ajar window


423
0:16:25,36 --> 0:16:26,78
somewhere, possibly
falling like eight


424
0:16:26,78 --> 0:16:27,53
stories to your death.


425
0:16:27,53 --> 0:16:29,171
That is not an upgrade.


426
0:16:29,171 --> 0:16:30,747
You know what else?


427
0:16:30,747 --> 0:16:32,178
There's nobody left!


428
0:16:32,178 --> 0:16:33,132
So many people on the planet.


429
0:16:33,132 --> 0:16:35,4
I'm all alone!


430
0:16:35,4 --> 0:16:35,517
Oh my God!


431
0:16:35,517 --> 0:16:35,994
I'm really lonely!


432
0:16:35,994 --> 0:16:36,948
I'm so happy, I'm
really happy.


433
0:16:36,948 --> 0:16:38,86
Everthing really sucks
on this side.


434
0:16:38,86 --> 0:16:39,506
Ahhh!


435
0:16:39,506 --> 0:16:43,88
You get with someone else,
do you love yourself?


436
0:16:43,88 --> 0:16:47,768
You get with someone else,
do you love youself?


437
0:16:47,768 --> 0:16:51,17



438
0:16:51,17 --> 0:16:54,86
'Cause life is--


439
0:16:54,86 --> 0:16:54,59
good.


440
0:16:54,59 --> 0:16:56,55
Over.


441
0:16:56,55 --> 0:16:57,305
Thanks, everybody.


442
0:16:57,305 --> 0:17:0,805



443
0:17:0,805 --> 0:17:2,23
Thanks, guys.


444
0:17:2,23 --> 0:17:4,46
We would now like to bring
out the next comedian.


445
0:17:4,46 --> 0:17:8,272
Please welcome the voice of the
eTrade baby, Pete Holmes.


446
0:17:8,272 --> 0:17:20,369



447
0:17:20,369 --> 0:17:22,3
PETE HOLMES: There's a
Snickers right there.


448
0:17:22,3 --> 0:17:24,3
Do you want a Snickers?


449
0:17:24,3 --> 0:17:27,65
You put your hand out
very entitled like.


450
0:17:27,65 --> 0:17:28,39
There you go.


451
0:17:28,39 --> 0:17:31,81
Someone stepped on it.


452
0:17:31,81 --> 0:17:32,34
Good to see you.


453
0:17:32,34 --> 0:17:32,97
Good to be here.


454
0:17:32,97 --> 0:17:35,32
I'm feeling pretty good.


455
0:17:35,32 --> 0:17:35,9
Thank you.


456
0:17:35,9 --> 0:17:39,37
Yeah, all right, just general
enthusiasm, I appreciate that.


457
0:17:39,37 --> 0:17:41,41
I'm feeling pretty good, despite
the fact that I ate at


458
0:17:41,41 --> 0:17:43,51
Subway for lunch.


459
0:17:43,51 --> 0:17:45,43
Yeah, no I know, I feel that.


460
0:17:45,43 --> 0:17:46,13
We all eat there.


461
0:17:46,13 --> 0:17:48,23
It's always crowded.


462
0:17:48,23 --> 0:17:50,45
But it is garbage.


463
0:17:50,45 --> 0:17:51,83
Don't back away.


464
0:17:51,83 --> 0:17:54,58
I'm probably going there
after the show.


465
0:17:54,58 --> 0:17:55,55
It's also horrible.


466
0:17:55,55 --> 0:17:56,81
It's the worst thing
in the world.


467
0:17:56,81 --> 0:17:57,56
And you know that.


468
0:17:57,56 --> 0:17:59,7
You know when you're in line
at Subway, part of you is


469
0:17:59,7 --> 0:18:0,77
looking forward to
your sandwich.


470
0:18:0,77 --> 0:18:4,15
But in the back of your brain,
you're just like, something


471
0:18:4,15 --> 0:18:6,87
fucked up is happening here.


472
0:18:6,87 --> 0:18:8,886
Can't quite put my
finger on it.


473
0:18:8,886 --> 0:18:11,85
But the call is coming from
inside the house.


474
0:18:11,85 --> 0:18:12,77
It's bad.


475
0:18:12,77 --> 0:18:13,35
You know this.


476
0:18:13,35 --> 0:18:15,44
Everything at Subway
tastes the same.


477
0:18:15,44 --> 0:18:18,9
It all tastes the way the
restaurant smells--


478
0:18:18,9 --> 0:18:21,61
that vague, cardboard,
sawdust smell.


479
0:18:21,61 --> 0:18:23,8
Everything, it doesn't matter
what you order, a sandwich,


480
0:18:23,8 --> 0:18:28,39
your soda, the receipt, it's
saturated in that smell.


481
0:18:28,39 --> 0:18:29,95
And they do it in
front of you.


482
0:18:29,95 --> 0:18:33,41
That's their big idea,
like you're a king.


483
0:18:33,41 --> 0:18:36,48
Choose from the bounty.


484
0:18:36,48 --> 0:18:39,6
'Tis been a good year.


485
0:18:39,6 --> 0:18:44,11
More orange tomatoes,
my liege?


486
0:18:44,11 --> 0:18:45,48
And they shouldn't.


487
0:18:45,48 --> 0:18:47,53
Have you ever, for the love of
God, been in the Subway when


488
0:18:47,53 --> 0:18:49,63
they run out of turkey?


489
0:18:49,63 --> 0:18:51,795
They don't just flick the lights
off, perfect blackness,


490
0:18:51,795 --> 0:18:54,41
flick them back on, and
have more turkey.


491
0:18:54,41 --> 0:18:55,91
That's what they should do.


492
0:18:55,91 --> 0:19:0,62
What they do do is reach down
into the bowels of hell,


493
0:19:0,62 --> 0:19:3,4
making unbreaking eye contact
like a college freshman


494
0:19:3,4 --> 0:19:6,6
playing Hey There Delilah on
the acoustic, just looking


495
0:19:6,6 --> 0:19:7,832
through you.


496
0:19:7,832 --> 0:19:10,98
And they pull out another shrink
wrapped plastic tube of


497
0:19:10,98 --> 0:19:14,97
turkey, with all the pieces the
exact same size, laser cut


498
0:19:14,97 --> 0:19:19,73
like coasters, with a fake skin
airbrushed on the side.


499
0:19:19,73 --> 0:19:21,72
They cut it out with that
little yellow knife.


500
0:19:21,72 --> 0:19:24,77
Satan's ass air is released.


501
0:19:24,77 --> 0:19:27,3
They're just like, three
disgusting pieces.


502
0:19:27,3 --> 0:19:28,8
We're just schmucks.


503
0:19:28,8 --> 0:19:29,58
Like oh, could I get
double meat?


504
0:19:29,58 --> 0:19:32,99
They're like, yeah, peeling
them off like ones from


505
0:19:32,99 --> 0:19:36,79
Satan's bank roll, everything
sitting on those black, open


506
0:19:36,79 --> 0:19:38,82
air, S&M containers.


507
0:19:38,82 --> 0:19:41,26
You can see your reflection
in the wet ham.


508
0:19:41,26 --> 0:19:43,97
It's gross.


509
0:19:43,97 --> 0:19:46,25
You shouldn't be able to watch
someone make something so


510
0:19:46,25 --> 0:19:46,62
disgusting.


511
0:19:46,62 --> 0:19:49,66
Bring it from the back.


512
0:19:49,66 --> 0:19:52,71
That's what the back is for.


513
0:19:52,71 --> 0:19:55,4
If this is what they're doing
in the front, what the hell


514
0:19:55,4 --> 0:19:57,12
are they doing in the back?


515
0:19:57,12 --> 0:20:2,5
Just shaving a gorilla, like,
new low fat gorilla bread.


516
0:20:2,5 --> 0:20:4,8
Jared's naked up to
here in marinara.


517
0:20:4,8 --> 0:20:7,35



518
0:20:7,35 --> 0:20:8,6
Eat fresh.


519
0:20:8,6 --> 0:20:10,84



520
0:20:10,84 --> 0:20:12,6
You can write your own
meatballs joke.


521
0:20:12,6 --> 0:20:15,3
I can't do everything.


522
0:20:15,3 --> 0:20:17,7
Very excited, there's magicians
on this show.


523
0:20:17,7 --> 0:20:17,73
Did you know that?


524
0:20:17,73 --> 0:20:20,5
Did you know you're going
to see magic?


525
0:20:20,5 --> 0:20:21,512
I'm stoked.


526
0:20:21,512 --> 0:20:23,82
I love magic.


527
0:20:23,82 --> 0:20:27,75
But I am very, very grateful
that I'm not a magician.


528
0:20:27,75 --> 0:20:30,29
Have you ever taken a moment to
be grateful that you're not


529
0:20:30,29 --> 0:20:31,22
a magician?


530
0:20:31,22 --> 0:20:33,51
I can come out and be like look,
I stepped on a Snickers.


531
0:20:33,51 --> 0:20:35,15
You want it, you entitled
person?


532
0:20:35,15 --> 0:20:36,61
I can do whatever I want.


533
0:20:36,61 --> 0:20:38,24
I'm just a hammy
guy, it's fine.


534
0:20:38,24 --> 0:20:41,11
A magician has to be magic.


535
0:20:41,11 --> 0:20:42,7
Are you listening?


536
0:20:42,7 --> 0:20:46,69
Magic, the thing that
none of us are.


537
0:20:46,69 --> 0:20:47,81
That is a lot of pressure.


538
0:20:47,81 --> 0:20:51,48
Backstage, you're just some
regular guy named Verne,


539
0:20:51,48 --> 0:20:52,31
eating nachos.


540
0:20:52,31 --> 0:20:53,99
Like yeah, it's a pretty
good house.


541
0:20:53,99 --> 0:20:55,0
Pretty good, yeah.


542
0:20:55,0 --> 0:20:56,37
The food's half off, my
parents are here.


543
0:20:56,37 --> 0:20:57,57
Putting a bird in your sleeve.


544
0:20:57,57 --> 0:20:59,3
It's going to be a good show.


545
0:20:59,3 --> 0:21:1,36
And they're like, ladies and
gentleman, Excelsior.


546
0:21:1,36 --> 0:21:4,16
You're like, excuse me.


547
0:21:4,16 --> 0:21:8,4
Covered in silk, like I was born
on the tip of a pyramid.


548
0:21:8,4 --> 0:21:9,37
Owls landing on you.


549
0:21:9,37 --> 0:21:12,93
You're just fucking Verne,
the nacho guy.


550
0:21:12,93 --> 0:21:14,4
And comedy audiences
are great.


551
0:21:14,4 --> 0:21:16,14
You guys want the
show to be good.


552
0:21:16,14 --> 0:21:20,4
Magic is the only kind of
entertainment where 99% of the


553
0:21:20,4 --> 0:21:23,605
audience is trying to ruin
the show for themselves.


554
0:21:23,605 --> 0:21:26,92
Go to a magic show, just a sea
of close minded, threatened


555
0:21:26,92 --> 0:21:29,23
dudes that are just like, no.


556
0:21:29,23 --> 0:21:30,87
No way.


557
0:21:30,87 --> 0:21:32,72
That ain't possible.


558
0:21:32,72 --> 0:21:34,8
It's probably a mirror, right?


559
0:21:34,8 --> 0:21:35,71
It's a mirror.


560
0:21:35,71 --> 0:21:36,515
You can't saw her in half.


561
0:21:36,515 --> 0:21:39,22
Shit's illegal.


562
0:21:39,22 --> 0:21:40,48
Yeah, you did it.


563
0:21:40,48 --> 0:21:42,58
You proved what no one else
was trying to prove.


564
0:21:42,58 --> 0:21:45,5
The boy on stage isn't
actually a wizard.


565
0:21:45,5 --> 0:21:46,1
Good job.


566
0:21:46,1 --> 0:21:48,75
It cost you $35 to
get in here.


567
0:21:48,75 --> 0:21:50,32
Not me, I love magic.


568
0:21:50,32 --> 0:21:52,16
Look at my friendly,
open face.


569
0:21:52,16 --> 0:21:53,35
I sit in the front.


570
0:21:53,35 --> 0:21:54,41
You think I volunteer?


571
0:21:54,41 --> 0:21:56,82
You're goddamn right
I volunteer.


572
0:21:56,82 --> 0:21:58,95
Magician drops a fake thumb,
I didn't see shit.


573
0:21:58,95 --> 0:22:0,82
I live in a non-magic
world all day.


574
0:22:0,82 --> 0:22:3,3
Make it magic.


575
0:22:3,3 --> 0:22:6,73
I saw a man fly at
a magic show.


576
0:22:6,73 --> 0:22:7,58
I didn't misspeak.


577
0:22:7,58 --> 0:22:9,82
I saw a man fly.


578
0:22:9,82 --> 0:22:12,9
A wingless mammal took flight.


579
0:22:12,9 --> 0:22:14,6
Can you imagine if
I flew right now?


580
0:22:14,6 --> 0:22:18,26
If I could just figure out the
muscle in my ass to flex?


581
0:22:18,26 --> 0:22:19,85
I pick fucking Snickers
girl up, and we


582
0:22:19,85 --> 0:22:22,17
fly around the room?


583
0:22:22,17 --> 0:22:23,61
Best night of our lives.


584
0:22:23,61 --> 0:22:24,58
And I saw this.


585
0:22:24,58 --> 0:22:26,15
And suddenly, I'm eight
years old again.


586
0:22:26,15 --> 0:22:27,86
And I'm filled with majesty
and wonder.


587
0:22:27,86 --> 0:22:30,91
And as I'm watching this man
fly, a guy next to me, I don't


588
0:22:30,91 --> 0:22:34,59
know this guy, who's this guy,
leans over to me and goes,


589
0:22:34,59 --> 0:22:37,69
it's a magnet.


590
0:22:37,69 --> 0:22:38,4
Magnet.


591
0:22:38,4 --> 0:22:40,35
No man can fly.


592
0:22:40,35 --> 0:22:41,6
Magnet.


593
0:22:41,6 --> 0:22:43,41



594
0:22:43,41 --> 0:22:44,11
Two things.


595
0:22:44,11 --> 0:22:46,54
First of all, shut up.


596
0:22:46,54 --> 0:22:48,72
Shut your mouth, and just
enjoy the show.


597
0:22:48,72 --> 0:22:50,11
Two, magnet?


598
0:22:50,11 --> 0:22:53,6
That doesn't explain shit.


599
0:22:53,6 --> 0:22:54,58

He's got magnets
in his pocket?


601
0:22:56,12 --> 0:22:57,43
The stage is a magnet?


602
0:22:57,43 --> 0:22:59,22
That would look horrible.


603
0:22:59,22 --> 0:23:2,23
I think those are just two
things he doesn't understand.


604
0:23:2,23 --> 0:23:8,17
Like, I don't get magnets,
and I don't get this.


605
0:23:8,17 --> 0:23:10,28
This is magnets.

participant in the Cute Off.

I feel that's rude to ask.

BLAKE ANDERSON: It
is a little bit.


685

he could be in a

0:27:16,39 --> 0:27:16,99

687

Maybe he doesn't want people
to know how much he weighs.

BLAKE ANDERSON: True.

Maybe we should make
them do something.

if that's possible.

just a genius move that I just

thought of and had them
preplan, maybe--


732

0:31:52,57 --> 0:31:54,7
Now that you get it, consider
yourselves warned.


797
0:31:54,7 --> 0:31:57,5
Last night, we stole the
script to this show.


798
0:31:57,5 --> 0:31:58,81
So we're about to spoil the rest
of tonight's festivities


799
0:31:58,81 --> 0:32:1,12
by giving away all the surprises
the other acts have


800
0:32:1,12 --> 0:32:1,83
in store for you.


801
0:32:1,83 --> 0:32:2,59
In one take.


802
0:32:2,59 --> 0:32:3,87
In under one minute.


803
0:32:3,87 --> 0:32:4,98
Starting now.


804
0:32:4,98 --> 0:32:6,37
Betty White gets shot
out of a cannon.


805
0:32:6,37 --> 0:32:7,73
Russell Brand premiers
his new scarf.


806
0:32:7,73 --> 0:32:10,0
Ryan Gosling finally eats all
that cereal people have been


807
0:32:10,0 --> 0:32:10,98
wanting him to eat.


808
0:32:10,98 --> 0:32:13,545
Zach Galifianakis reveals
his downstairs beard.


809
0:32:13,545 --> 0:32:16,245
Kim Jong performs his new
single, the Jong Song, Jong


810
0:32:16,245 --> 0:32:17,56
Jong, Jong Jong Jong Jong.


811
0:32:17,56 --> 0:32:19,65
Weird Al sings his version of
Passion Pit's "Carried Away"


812
0:32:19,65 --> 0:32:20,75
called "Married and Gay."


813
0:32:20,75 --> 0:32:23,24
After taking over two movie
franchises, JJ Abrams will


814
0:32:23,24 --> 0:32:25,69
start an Arby's franchise and
change his name to JJ Arby's.


815
0:32:25,69 --> 0:32:28,27
David Blaine levitates using
only the power of his mind.


816
0:32:28,27 --> 0:32:30,46
John Hamm levitates using only
the power of his penis.


817
0:32:30,46 --> 0:32:32,56
Amanda Bynes premiers the
trailer of the documentary


818
0:32:32,56 --> 0:32:33,88
she's been filming
all this time,


819
0:32:33,88 --> 0:32:35,6
directed by Joaquin Phoenix.


820
0:32:35,6 --> 0:32:36,86
Someone makes a joke about
Angelina Jolie


821
0:32:36,86 --> 0:32:38,4
that is far too soon.


822
0:32:38,4 --> 0:32:40,59
Zooey Deschanel gets bullied
for being too adorkable.


823
0:32:40,59 --> 0:32:42,91
We get beat up by Zooey
Deschanel at the after party


824
0:32:42,91 --> 0:32:44,4
for making that stupid joke.


825
0:32:44,4 --> 0:32:46,1
Everyone on this list ends
up hating us forever.


826
0:32:46,1 --> 0:32:47,81
We never work in Hollywood
ever again.


827
0:32:47,81 --> 0:32:49,99
Every day, we ponder why we
ever agreed to do this.


828
0:32:49,99 --> 0:32:51,54
Our life loses all meaning and
we wander the streets and


829
0:32:51,54 --> 0:32:52,39
ultimately become homeless.


830
0:32:52,39 --> 0:32:54,21
And every day, we try to lift
our spirits back up by


831
0:32:54,21 --> 0:32:56,16
watching baby sloth videos
through the windows at a Best


832
0:32:56,16 --> 0:32:57,35
Buy to no avail.


833
0:32:57,35 --> 0:32:58,85
Then we realize none of
these celebrities


834
0:32:58,85 --> 0:32:59,74
are even here tonight.


835
0:32:59,74 --> 0:33:0,96
But here's someone who is.


836
0:33:0,96 --> 0:33:2,4
Please welcome the star
of his own show on


837
0:33:2,4 --> 0:33:3,765
Adult Swim, Eric Andre.


838
0:33:3,765 --> 0:33:13,94



839
0:33:13,94 --> 0:33:14,92
ERIC ANDRE: Thank you.


840
0:33:14,92 --> 0:33:15,9
Where's the mark?


841
0:33:15,9 --> 0:33:16,4
Who knows.


842
0:33:16,4 --> 0:33:17,44
Am I on my mark?


843
0:33:17,44 --> 0:33:20,68
I was supposed to come out on
a camel, but camels fucking


844
0:33:20,68 --> 0:33:21,71
hate people.


845
0:33:21,71 --> 0:33:24,28
So I don't know if that
fucked up their job,


846
0:33:24,28 --> 0:33:25,2
but who gives a shit.


847
0:33:25,2 --> 0:33:28,265
We're all going to die one
day, right, Internet?


848
0:33:28,265 --> 0:33:32,55
We're all going to die.


849
0:33:32,55 --> 0:33:35,89
All right, I am so
high right now.


850
0:33:35,89 --> 0:33:40,5
I went home to Boca Raton,
Florida to visit my parents.


851
0:33:40,5 --> 0:33:42,39
Yeah, Boca in the house.


852
0:33:42,39 --> 0:33:45,696
Boca's where your grandparents
go to die, if you don't know.


853
0:33:45,696 --> 0:33:48,31
It's God's waiting room.


854
0:33:48,31 --> 0:33:50,16
I went home to visit
my parents.


855
0:33:50,16 --> 0:33:53,23
And I text messaged this girl
Kerri that I used to hook up


856
0:33:53,23 --> 0:33:54,44
with back in the day.


857
0:33:54,44 --> 0:33:57,66
Right when I landed, I texted
her, come over.


858
0:33:57,66 --> 0:34:1,7
Because I am a class act
gentleman that cuts straight


859
0:34:1,7 --> 0:34:2,23
to the chase.


860
0:34:2,23 --> 0:34:5,74
Ladies, question mark?


861
0:34:5,74 --> 0:34:7,66
And she didn't respond
to that.


862
0:34:7,66 --> 0:34:10,12
Come over, my penis and your
vagina should hang out.


863
0:34:10,12 --> 0:34:13,29
She didn't respond
to my subtleties.


864
0:34:13,29 --> 0:34:15,81
So I wrote her again, and I was
like, are you mad at me?


865
0:34:15,81 --> 0:34:17,7
And then she goes, no, sorry.


866
0:34:17,7 --> 0:34:19,58
I'm in Colorado with
my boyfriend.


867
0:34:19,58 --> 0:34:20,33
No big deal.


868
0:34:20,33 --> 0:34:22,215
I didn't know she was in
a different state.


869
0:34:22,215 --> 0:34:23,75
I didn't know she
had a boyfriend.


870
0:34:23,75 --> 0:34:27,4
Pretty benign conversation,
right, Asian guy


871
0:34:27,4 --> 0:34:28,247
in the third row?


872
0:34:28,247 --> 0:34:31,5
You know what I'm
talking about?


873
0:34:31,5 --> 0:34:34,649
So then, I go, come over, are
you mad at me, no sorry, I'm


874
0:34:34,649 --> 0:34:35,57
in Colorado with my boyfriend.


875
0:34:35,57 --> 0:34:36,249
Not a big deal.


876
0:34:36,249 --> 0:34:39,179
Then I get a text from a
number I don't know.


877
0:34:39,179 --> 0:34:40,12
Hi.


878
0:34:40,12 --> 0:34:42,9
And I write, who is this?


879
0:34:42,9 --> 0:34:44,13
And they go, are
you a comedian?


880
0:34:44,13 --> 0:34:45,77
And I'm like, yes.


881
0:34:45,77 --> 0:34:50,556
Another fan, besides my mom.


882
0:34:50,556 --> 0:34:54,5
Then they go, I'm Casey,
Kerri's boyfriend.


883
0:34:54,5 --> 0:34:54,989
Ruh roh.


884
0:34:54,989 --> 0:34:57,8
And I swear to God, I'm
not making this up.


885
0:34:57,8 --> 0:34:58,6
I'll text each and
every one of you.


886
0:34:58,6 --> 0:35:1,16
Can you see that, Camera 2?


887
0:35:1,16 --> 0:35:2,9
Can you see?


888
0:35:2,9 --> 0:35:3,67
I'll text each and every one
of you after the show.


889
0:35:3,67 --> 0:35:5,38
This is a real story.


890
0:35:5,38 --> 0:35:7,58
Then I'll go back to lying
compulsively right afterwards.


891
0:35:7,58 --> 0:35:10,53
So I'm Casey, Kerri's
boyfriend.


892
0:35:10,53 --> 0:35:12,32
I got a joke for you.


893
0:35:12,32 --> 0:35:15,33
This guy keeps bothering my
girlfriend to the point where


894
0:35:15,33 --> 0:35:16,71
I get involved.


895
0:35:16,71 --> 0:35:18,7
Want to know the punchline?


896
0:35:18,7 --> 0:35:19,73
Keep it up.


897
0:35:19,73 --> 0:35:23,68
You'll find out.


898
0:35:23,68 --> 0:35:26,668
Swear to God this is a real
conversation happening between


899
0:35:26,668 --> 0:35:27,34
two people.


900
0:35:27,34 --> 0:35:28,75
You're the most beautiful
woman I've


901
0:35:28,75 --> 0:35:29,28
ever seen in my life.


902
0:35:29,28 --> 0:35:31,7
You know what I'm
talking about.


903
0:35:31,7 --> 0:35:33,43
So then I write back
to the guy.


904
0:35:33,43 --> 0:35:36,73
I go, what are you, dude, a bad
guy from a spring break


905
0:35:36,73 --> 0:35:39,35
movie from the '80s?


906
0:35:39,35 --> 0:35:42,7
Because who in the fuck
talks like that?


907
0:35:42,7 --> 0:35:48,81
See you on the K12, Myer.


908
0:35:48,81 --> 0:35:50,31
So then he writes all
this shit back.


909
0:35:50,31 --> 0:35:52,4
Eric, I'm normally a
pretty civil guy.


910
0:35:52,4 --> 0:35:54,42
You asking my girlfriend
to come over?


911
0:35:54,42 --> 0:35:55,45
That's funny.


912
0:35:55,45 --> 0:35:59,315
We can go back and forth, but
I'd rather not waste my time.


913
0:35:59,315 --> 0:36:0,71
Leave Kerri alone.


914
0:36:0,71 --> 0:36:2,57
Don't call her, don't
text her.


915
0:36:2,57 --> 0:36:5,29
Because you're not her friend,
just a one hit


916
0:36:5,29 --> 0:36:6,94
wonder from her past.


917
0:36:6,94 --> 0:36:9,49



918
0:36:9,49 --> 0:36:11,23
I'm willing to just forget
everything, including your


919
0:36:11,23 --> 0:36:13,21
name, number, et cetera.


920
0:36:13,21 --> 0:36:17,29
Let's end this, dot
dot dot, now.


921
0:36:17,29 --> 0:36:22,38
So I just put, dot
dot dot, or else.


922
0:36:22,38 --> 0:36:24,88
And I was like, hey man, where
you texting me from?


923
0:36:24,88 --> 0:36:29,28
The Cobra Kai Dojo, you
fucking weirdo?


924
0:36:29,28 --> 0:36:32,6
You're just a one hit
wonder for her past.


925
0:36:32,6 --> 0:36:34,12
That doesn't make sense
in that context.


926
0:36:34,12 --> 0:36:37,12
I'm sick of my girlfriend
fucking all these one hit


927
0:36:37,12 --> 0:36:38,34
wonders, man.


928
0:36:38,34 --> 0:36:39,57
She fucked you.


929
0:36:39,57 --> 0:36:41,25
She fucked Chumbawumba.


930
0:36:41,25 --> 0:36:42,5
I've had enough.


931
0:36:42,5 --> 0:36:46,18



932
0:36:46,18 --> 0:36:48,45
So anyway, five minutes
later, I texted the


933
0:36:48,45 --> 0:36:51,39
girl back, come over.


934
0:36:51,39 --> 0:36:52,42
All right, thank you so much.


935
0:36:52,42 --> 0:36:53,67
Good night!


936
0:36:53,67 --> 0:37:14,2



937
0:37:14,2 --> 0:37:16,714
Oh man.


938
0:37:16,714 --> 0:37:17,964
Fuck.


939
0:37:17,964 --> 0:37:34,39



940
0:37:34,39 --> 0:37:35,88
THE GREGORY BROTHERS:
Carl, hey.


941
0:37:35,88 --> 0:37:37,24
Welcome back from vacation.


942
0:37:37,24 --> 0:37:38,81
It was amazing, man.


943
0:37:38,81 --> 0:37:40,7
Eight years in the Andes.


944
0:37:40,7 --> 0:37:41,49
Es paraiso.


945
0:37:41,49 --> 0:37:42,545
Wow, eight years.


946
0:37:42,545 --> 0:37:44,52
Our company has the best
vacation policy.


947
0:37:44,52 --> 0:37:48,46
Yeah, I just feel so refreshed
and ready to really focus.


948
0:37:48,46 --> 0:37:50,17
Be warned.


949
0:37:50,17 --> 0:37:52,716
The world has changed
a lot since 2005.


950
0:37:52,716 --> 0:37:54,0
Check this out.


951
0:37:54,0 --> 0:37:55,19
Yeah, laptops.


952
0:37:55,19 --> 0:37:57,5
I had a laptop before I moved.


953
0:37:57,5 --> 0:37:58,97
Did this one come
with wireless?


954
0:37:58,97 --> 0:38:1,8
This isn't about
laptops, Carl.


955
0:38:1,8 --> 0:38:1,65
Oh.


956
0:38:1,65 --> 0:38:4,5
I'm talking about
YouTube, Carl.


957
0:38:4,5 --> 0:38:5,3
YouTube.


958
0:38:5,3 --> 0:38:9,46



959
0:38:9,46 --> 0:38:11,5
Could this be what
I think it is?


960
0:38:11,5 --> 0:38:11,926
Yes it is.


961
0:38:11,926 --> 0:38:12,352
Holy moly.


962
0:38:12,352 --> 0:38:15,63
But before you click, think real
hard before you do that.


963
0:38:15,63 --> 0:38:17,7
If you don't slow down, you
could get whiplash.


964
0:38:17,7 --> 0:38:18,57
What'd you say?


965
0:38:18,57 --> 0:38:20,398
I was watching cute cats.


966
0:38:20,398 --> 0:38:21,77
And have you seen the one with
the little girl's rat?


967
0:38:21,77 --> 0:38:23,86
Wait, hold up, don't
go too fast.


968
0:38:23,86 --> 0:38:25,48
Once you dive in, you
can never turn back.


969
0:38:25,48 --> 0:38:30,646
Life will never be the
same now that I've


970
0:38:30,646 --> 0:38:32,86
seen Chocolate Rain.


971
0:38:32,86 --> 0:38:37,357
And I never knew a goat could
scream like that, or the


972
0:38:37,357 --> 0:38:40,291
simple pleasures of
a pop-tart cat.


973
0:38:40,291 --> 0:38:44,203
Oh, YouTube.


974
0:38:44,203 --> 0:38:47,646
I can stay and play, watching
Trololo for 10 hours straight.


975
0:38:47,646 --> 0:38:48,618
That's a good one.


976
0:38:48,618 --> 0:38:51,48
Oh, YouTube.


977
0:38:51,48 --> 0:38:55,422
Refreshing PewDiePie's page,
until we die of old age.


978
0:38:55,422 --> 0:38:58,581
First you get sucked in by
dubstep dance, then there's


979
0:38:58,581 --> 0:39:0,282
people in the subway
who wear no pants.


980
0:39:0,282 --> 0:39:2,426
You might start small with a
laughing baby, then you end up


981
0:39:2,426 --> 0:39:3,46
singing with "Call Me Maybe"


982
0:39:3,46 --> 0:39:7,69
I just got trigonometry, and how
to put bacon in lasagna.


983
0:39:7,69 --> 0:39:8,995
People share the life lesson
of the [INAUDIBLE].


984
0:39:8,995 --> 0:39:10,839
Or they just stuff things
into a blender.


985
0:39:10,839 --> 0:39:14,29
Life won't be the same again.


986
0:39:14,29 --> 0:39:17,741
now that I can wait
for all of it.


987
0:39:17,741 --> 0:39:22,671
And I never even knew that
pandas sneeze, or how my


988
0:39:22,671 --> 0:39:25,136
eyebrows should be tweezed.


989
0:39:25,136 --> 0:39:28,94

I always wanted to know
how a ninja fights.

to upload a video

to YouTube in 2005.

Very important.


1123
0:47:34,91 --> 0:47:37,22

keep making videos.

0:47:37,22 --> 0:47:38,29
Doesn't really matter
what they are.

have awesome hair.

If you have great hair, people
want to watch you.

0:47:48,9 --> 0:47:50,68
Sometimes they want to touch
you inappropriately.

John Stamos knows what
I'm talking about.

ANTHONY PADILLA: Full House?


1134
0:47:56,23 --> 0:47:56,54
IAN HECOX: Yeah.


1135
0:47:56,54 --> 0:47:58,5

IAN HECOX: Step Three is be
booked on a live show.


1137
0:48:0,44 --> 0:48:2,73
And this is kind of important.


1138
0:48:2,73 --> 0:48:4,31
ANTHONY PADILLA: Arguably
the most important part.


1139
0:48:4,31 --> 0:48:7,1
IAN HECOX: And I mean, you can't
just get up here and do


1140
0:48:7,1 --> 0:48:8,2
something crazy.


1141
0:48:8,2 --> 0:48:8,89
You're not Kanye.


1142
0:48:8,89 --> 0:48:11,92
So don't fucking do that.


1143
0:48:11,92 --> 0:48:12,4
ANTHONY PADILLA: Oh, yeah.


1144
0:48:12,4 --> 0:48:15,5
Have a good rapport
with your partner.


1145
0:48:15,5 --> 0:48:15,71
What's up?


1146
0:48:15,71 --> 0:48:17,53
IAN HECOX: What's up?


1147
0:48:17,53 --> 0:48:18,52
ANTHONY PADILLA: All
right, check.


1148
0:48:18,52 --> 0:48:21,53
And most importantly, introduce
the person together.


1149
0:48:21,53 --> 0:48:22,42
IAN HECOX: All right.


1150
0:48:22,42 --> 0:48:24,54

put your hands


1151
0:48:24,54 --> 0:48:26,623

1153
0:48:40,84 --> 0:48:41,91
KYLE KINANE: Good with
their music.


1154
0:48:41,91 --> 0:48:43,69

1155
0:48:43,69 --> 0:48:45,73
YouTube, huh?


1156
0:48:45,73 --> 0:48:48,54
Did you see that cat earlier
with the tongue?


1157
0:48:48,54 --> 0:48:49,285
It was adorable.


1158
0:48:49,285 --> 0:48:51,26
It was like it had a little
kitten stroke.


1159
0:48:51,26 --> 0:48:52,74
That's nice.


1160
0:48:52,74 --> 0:48:54,93
Let's exploit that, YouTube.


1161
0:48:54,93 --> 0:48:57,59
Looking forward to all the
14-year-old dick heads calling


1162
0:48:57,59 --> 0:49:0,81
me a homo in the comments
section after this.


1163
0:49:0,81 --> 0:49:2,35
That's what we're
going to get.


1164
0:49:2,35 --> 0:49:4,81
YouTube, where Christians
go to see tits.


1165
0:49:4,81 --> 0:49:6,6
OK.


1166
0:49:6,6 --> 0:49:8,85



1167
0:49:8,85 --> 0:49:9,64
I'll make it quick.


1168
0:49:9,64 --> 0:49:12,2
I'll just check the barometer
of the room.


1169
0:49:12,2 --> 0:49:13,98
See if you'll get
along with me.


1170
0:49:13,98 --> 0:49:16,73
I'll just let you know
about myself.


1171
0:49:16,73 --> 0:49:21,75
Last Sunday, I picked my nose.


1172
0:49:21,75 --> 0:49:22,37
It's what you do.


1173
0:49:22,37 --> 0:49:23,56
It happens, right?


1174
0:49:23,56 --> 0:49:24,55
It's your finger,
it's your nose.


1175
0:49:24,55 --> 0:49:24,94
They fit.


1176
0:49:24,94 --> 0:49:26,77
Why not, go for it.


1177
0:49:26,77 --> 0:49:29,46
Love yourself.


1178
0:49:29,46 --> 0:49:33,6
And I didn't want to wipe it on
my couch, because I'm not


1179
0:49:33,6 --> 0:49:35,9
an asshole.


1180
0:49:35,9 --> 0:49:39,914
I was too lazy to go and get
up and get a Kleenex.


1181
0:49:39,914 --> 0:49:42,36
So I put it back in my nose.


1182
0:49:42,36 --> 0:49:45,76



1183
0:49:45,76 --> 0:49:48,35
If you think that's funny, we're
going to get along for


1184
0:49:48,35 --> 0:49:50,54
the next five minutes.


1185
0:49:50,54 --> 0:49:52,54
If not, maybe you want to go
to the bathroom and grab a


1186
0:49:52,54 --> 0:49:53,13
smoke break.


1187
0:49:53,13 --> 0:49:54,84
I don't know.


1188
0:49:54,84 --> 0:49:58,53
I recently experienced a defeat
disguised as a victory.


1189
0:49:58,53 --> 0:49:59,98
I don't know if it's ever
happened to you.


1190
0:49:59,98 --> 0:50:2,22
My friend was like, what do got
going on tomorrow morning?


1191
0:50:2,22 --> 0:50:4,26
I was like, I don't have
to wake up for nothing.


1192
0:50:4,26 --> 0:50:10,0



1193
0:50:10,0 --> 0:50:12,48
I don't have to wake
up for nothing.


1194
0:50:12,48 --> 0:50:16,41
Literally nothing requires
my existence tomorrow.


1195
0:50:16,41 --> 0:50:19,82
Tomorrow, I could just not be.


1196
0:50:19,82 --> 0:50:21,23
That's like an optimistic way to
say, what do you got going


1197
0:50:21,23 --> 0:50:22,64
on tomorrow morning?


1198
0:50:22,64 --> 0:50:23,9
I could die in my sleep.


1199
0:50:23,9 --> 0:50:25,295
It wouldn't matter.


1200
0:50:25,295 --> 0:50:27,46
Awesome.


1201
0:50:27,46 --> 0:50:28,91
This is a fancy show.


1202
0:50:28,91 --> 0:50:29,62
I don't think I belong.


1203
0:50:29,62 --> 0:50:32,86
I feel like a fart in
a tuxedo up here.


1204
0:50:32,86 --> 0:50:34,0
This is nice.


1205
0:50:34,0 --> 0:50:38,3
For more information about me,
I just stopped getting


1206
0:50:38,3 --> 0:50:42,34
diarrhea, which would
be great, but I


1207
0:50:42,34 --> 0:50:44,88
didn't change my lifestyle.


1208
0:50:44,88 --> 0:50:47,8
You know how you drive your
car around with the check


1209
0:50:47,8 --> 0:50:47,69
engine light?


1210
0:50:47,69 --> 0:50:50,54
And then the check engine light
goes off, but you didn't


1211
0:50:50,54 --> 0:50:53,1
fix your car?


1212
0:50:53,1 --> 0:50:55,66
That just means that that's my
body's way of saying, you're


1213
0:50:55,66 --> 0:50:57,3
not heeding warning signs.


1214
0:50:57,3 --> 0:50:59,866
Enjoy the last six months
of your life.


1215
0:50:59,866 --> 0:51:2,15
That's what we'll get into.


1216
0:51:2,15 --> 0:51:3,56
I don't know.


1217
0:51:3,56 --> 0:51:6,3
Like socially, this should make
it easier to be social,


1218
0:51:6,3 --> 0:51:7,35
stuff like this.


1219
0:51:7,35 --> 0:51:9,3
You go out, you talk to
people every night.


1220
0:51:9,3 --> 0:51:10,19
It should be getting easier.


1221
0:51:10,19 --> 0:51:12,48
But instead, more and more, I
just feel like I'm backed into


1222
0:51:12,48 --> 0:51:14,77
a corner with bright lights on
me, and I'm just trying to


1223
0:51:14,77 --> 0:51:15,62
defend myself.


1224
0:51:15,62 --> 0:51:18,18
Like every night's an
away gave, you know?


1225
0:51:18,18 --> 0:51:19,59
This is where I'm at socially.


1226
0:51:19,59 --> 0:51:23,85
Not too long ago, I said
God bless you to a cat.


1227
0:51:23,85 --> 0:51:27,14
It's not like I was in a room
with people and cats and I


1228
0:51:27,14 --> 0:51:29,3
heard a sneeze, and
my gentlemanly


1229
0:51:29,3 --> 0:51:30,9
instinct kicked in.


1230
0:51:30,9 --> 0:51:34,3
I was just alone in a room with
a cat, which was already


1231
0:51:34,3 --> 0:51:35,11
a day in my life.


1232
0:51:35,11 --> 0:51:38,45
I'm just alone, not my room, not
my cat, just sitting on a


1233
0:51:38,45 --> 0:51:40,19
futon with a cat.


1234
0:51:40,19 --> 0:51:41,85
He's looking one way, I'm
looking the other.


1235
0:51:41,85 --> 0:51:45,18
We're just looking for
answers, you know?


1236
0:51:45,18 --> 0:51:47,27
The cat sneezed.


1237
0:51:47,27 --> 0:51:48,97
And then it was quiet.


1238
0:51:48,97 --> 0:51:51,64
And that made me feel
uncomfortable.


1239
0:51:51,64 --> 0:51:54,541
Because I was raised right.


1240
0:51:54,541 --> 0:51:56,3
So I was like, I should
say something.


1241
0:51:56,3 --> 0:51:57,45
I'm like, but it's a cat.


1242
0:51:57,45 --> 0:51:59,672
Yeah, but we're all
God's creatures.


1243
0:51:59,672 --> 0:52:1,24
So I'm like, all right,
I'm going for it.


1244
0:52:1,24 --> 0:52:2,68
And I was like, God bless you.


1245
0:52:2,68 --> 0:52:3,89
And the cat looked at me.


1246
0:52:3,89 --> 0:52:4,6
Because that's what they do.


1247
0:52:4,6 --> 0:52:6,57
Cats look at the origins
of sounds.


1248
0:52:6,57 --> 0:52:10,25
But they also have very,
very judgmental faces.


1249
0:52:10,25 --> 0:52:11,38
So this cat looked at me.


1250
0:52:11,38 --> 0:52:15,67
And instantly, I knew it was
like, listen man, I think you


1251
0:52:15,67 --> 0:52:16,8
say stuff like God bless you.


1252
0:52:16,8 --> 0:52:19,67
You know I don't have a belief
system put into place that


1253
0:52:19,67 --> 0:52:22,22
would require you to mention
some sort of deity.


1254
0:52:22,22 --> 0:52:24,59
I think you say these things
to convince yourself that


1255
0:52:24,59 --> 0:52:26,39
you're a good person,
with your pleases


1256
0:52:26,39 --> 0:52:27,18
and your thank yous.


1257
0:52:27,18 --> 0:52:29,5
But deep down, you're trying
to hide some darkness.


1258
0:52:29,5 --> 0:52:30,42
That's what you're
saying there.


1259
0:52:30,42 --> 0:52:33,55
Furthermore, I was worshipped
in ancient Egypt as a god.


1260
0:52:33,55 --> 0:52:36,1
If I need to bless myself,
I can bless myself.


1261
0:52:36,1 --> 0:52:37,25
That's how it works with me.


1262
0:52:37,25 --> 0:52:39,7
It actually comes
in very handy.


1263
0:52:39,7 --> 0:52:40,22
I sneeze all the time.


1264
0:52:40,22 --> 0:52:41,57
I'm covered in cat hair.


1265
0:52:41,57 --> 0:52:43,76
And my response to that was
like, well then, go fuck


1266
0:52:43,76 --> 0:52:45,41
yourself, cat.


1267
0:52:45,41 --> 0:52:49,15
But if you were just a fly on
the wall, you just saw me in a


1268
0:52:49,15 --> 0:52:50,92
room go, God bless you, cat.


1269
0:52:50,92 --> 0:52:52,31
Go fuck yourself, cat.


1270
0:52:52,31 --> 0:52:54,2
And that's why I don't
socialize well.


1271
0:52:54,2 --> 0:52:55,99
That's why this is getting
more and more


1272
0:52:55,99 --> 0:52:59,49
difficult for me.


1273
0:52:59,49 --> 0:53:1,32
I was on an elevator.


1274
0:53:1,32 --> 0:53:4,98
Guy got on the elevator,
regular looking dude.


1275
0:53:4,98 --> 0:53:6,19
And doors closed.


1276
0:53:6,19 --> 0:53:8,74
And he looked at me, said,
you smell nice.


1277
0:53:8,74 --> 0:53:10,31
And I said, thank you.


1278
0:53:10,31 --> 0:53:13,69
Because I don't hear
that ever.


1279
0:53:13,69 --> 0:53:15,27
I smell how I look.


1280
0:53:15,27 --> 0:53:16,13
That's this.


1281
0:53:16,13 --> 0:53:17,24
I don't hear compliments.


1282
0:53:17,24 --> 0:53:18,63
I hear comments.


1283
0:53:18,63 --> 0:53:21,69
I hear people commenting on the
general odor of the area,


1284
0:53:21,69 --> 0:53:24,32
stuff like, who would leave
taquitos in a golf shoe like


1285
0:53:24,32 --> 0:53:25,25
that anyway?


1286
0:53:25,25 --> 0:53:26,53
I hear that kind of stuff.


1287
0:53:26,53 --> 0:53:27,85
It's not Old Spice.


1288
0:53:27,85 --> 0:53:29,6
It's old spices.


1289
0:53:29,6 --> 0:53:32,88
It's expired seasonings, some
paprika that somebody kicked


1290
0:53:32,88 --> 0:53:34,29
under the stove seven
years ago.


1291
0:53:34,29 --> 0:53:36,15
That could be it.


1292
0:53:36,15 --> 0:53:37,2
So I said, thank you.


1293
0:53:37,2 --> 0:53:40,82
But then this guy, then he kind
of showed his cards a bit


1294
0:53:40,82 --> 0:53:41,94
with the whole thing.


1295
0:53:41,94 --> 0:53:44,98
Because then he kind of
gets a different look.


1296
0:53:44,98 --> 0:53:47,59
He goes, you just get
out of the shower?


1297
0:53:47,59 --> 0:53:50,48
OK, all right, that's
a bit forward.


1298
0:53:50,48 --> 0:53:52,14
That's a man with a plan.


1299
0:53:52,14 --> 0:53:54,61
Now, whereas somebody else
should take that as a warning


1300
0:53:54,61 --> 0:53:56,82
and be like, this guy's got
something up, I was excited


1301
0:53:56,82 --> 0:53:59,44
for the opportunity of
conversation, I just went off.


1302
0:53:59,44 --> 0:54:0,36
I'm like, what do you smell?


1303
0:54:0,36 --> 0:54:1,3
Is it lavender?


1304
0:54:1,3 --> 0:54:2,9
Is it lavender?


1305
0:54:2,9 --> 0:54:4,4
I'm using a new face scrub
that's lavender.


1306
0:54:4,4 --> 0:54:6,11
People are saying it's
very overpowering.


1307
0:54:6,11 --> 0:54:7,72
They're mistaking it
for a whole shower.


1308
0:54:7,72 --> 0:54:9,1
But really, it's just my face.


1309
0:54:9,1 --> 0:54:10,26
Tell me, is it lavender?


1310
0:54:10,26 --> 0:54:13,88
And he just left the elevator.


1311
0:54:13,88 --> 0:54:16,0
And that's when I realized
that I had out creeped a


1312
0:54:16,0 --> 0:54:17,12
creeper in that moment.


1313
0:54:17,12 --> 0:54:18,91
That's what I had done.


1314
0:54:18,91 --> 0:54:22,84
My own desperation became a form
of self-defense, when I


1315
0:54:22,84 --> 0:54:24,73
became too much work
for a pervert.


1316
0:54:24,73 --> 0:54:25,78
That's what happened.


1317
0:54:25,78 --> 0:54:27,83
This guy's like, this guy's just
going to chew through the


1318
0:54:27,83 --> 0:54:30,2
whole gag and ruin
the van ride.


1319
0:54:30,2 --> 0:54:31,68
I don't have all day.


1320
0:54:31,68 --> 0:54:34,5
I just wanted a hump and dump.


1321
0:54:34,5 --> 0:54:36,64
I'm still waving through the
closing doors, where you


1322
0:54:36,64 --> 0:54:37,52
going, new friend?


1323
0:54:37,52 --> 0:54:38,74
Don't you want to watch "Silver


1324
0:54:38,74 --> 0:54:40,76
Linings Playbook" together?


1325
0:54:40,76 --> 0:54:42,43
All right, that's it for me.


1326
0:54:42,43 --> 0:54:42,77
Have a good night.


1327
0:54:42,77 --> 0:54:44,2
Thanks.


1328
0:54:44,2 --> 0:55:13,35



1329
0:55:13,35 --> 0:55:13,842
SHANE DAWSON: Hi.


1330
0:55:13,842 --> 0:55:15,95
My name is Shane Dawson.


1331
0:55:15,95 --> 0:55:18,69
And I've been making videos
on YouTube since 2006.


1332
0:55:18,69 --> 0:55:20,47
And a lot's changed
since then.


1333
0:55:20,47 --> 0:55:23,38
Back in '06, the only form of
comedy on YouTube was a


1334
0:55:23,38 --> 0:55:26,65
toddler playfully nibbling on
his brother's finger, and a


1335
0:55:26,65 --> 0:55:28,99
big fat black woman falling
on a coffee table and


1336
0:55:28,99 --> 0:55:30,64
breaking her ass.


1337
0:55:30,64 --> 0:55:33,4
And now, we've moved on to
bigger and better things, like


1338
0:55:33,4 --> 0:55:35,115
a different big fat black woman
choking on cinnamon


1339
0:55:35,115 --> 0:55:38,96
until she almost dies, and a
bunch of tweenagers shoving


1340
0:55:38,96 --> 0:55:41,29
condoms up their nose, trying to
sniff them into their nasal


1341
0:55:41,29 --> 0:55:44,65
cavities and then pull them
out of their mouths.


1342
0:55:44,65 --> 0:55:45,96
That's a real thing.


1343
0:55:45,96 --> 0:55:46,92
I've done it.


1344
0:55:46,92 --> 0:55:48,49
It works.


1345
0:55:48,49 --> 0:55:49,79
Everybody, YouTube
has evolved.


1346
0:55:49,79 --> 0:55:51,2
And I think it deserves
a slow clap.


1347
0:55:51,2 --> 0:55:53,85
Come on, everybody.


1348
0:55:53,85 --> 0:55:55,81
Too fast, too fast.


1349
0:55:55,81 --> 0:55:57,93
So tweenagers, take those
condoms out of your nose and


1350
0:55:57,93 --> 0:55:58,43
your mouth.


1351
0:55:58,43 --> 0:55:59,25
You're going to need them.


1352
0:55:59,25 --> 0:56:0,854
Because here is Three Loco.


1353
0:56:0,854 --> 0:56:6,29



1354
0:56:6,29 --> 0:56:7,54
THREE LOCO: Oh my goodness.


1355
0:56:7,54 --> 0:56:13,7



1356
0:56:13,7 --> 0:56:16,46
Step in the club, and we're
looking real neato.


1357
0:56:16,46 --> 0:56:18,61
I'll be getting bitches
in my blue tuxedo.


1358
0:56:18,61 --> 0:56:21,75
We're neato, like a giraffe
in a speedo.


1359
0:56:21,75 --> 0:56:23,25
What's up, sonny?


1360
0:56:23,25 --> 0:56:25,25
Que pasa, mijo?


1361
0:56:25,25 --> 0:56:27,75
Chilling with Rihanna
out in Puerto Rico.


1362
0:56:27,75 --> 0:56:31,702
She ate my coconut, because
she thought it was a Zico.


1363
0:56:31,702 --> 0:56:33,785
I beat up the block like Steven
Seagal, pour a four in


1364
0:56:33,785 --> 0:56:36,115
a Pellegrino, driving backwards
through Reno.


1365
0:56:36,115 --> 0:56:39,26
Pointy sided Dorito, go ahead,
shoot the free throw.


1366
0:56:39,26 --> 0:56:42,34
I pull up at the casino, candy
Cheetos steamboat.


1367
0:56:42,34 --> 0:56:44,58
Desert Eagle, I flash
the Buick Regal.


1368
0:56:44,58 --> 0:56:47,31
I pull up on you people,
buttercream Beetle.


1369
0:56:47,31 --> 0:56:49,49
Neato, neato, neat,
neat, neato.


1370
0:56:49,49 --> 0:56:52,96
Neato, neato, neat,
neat, neato.


1371
0:56:52,96 --> 0:56:53,95
We're neato.


1372
0:56:53,95 --> 0:56:55,685
Look Mom, we're neato.


1373
0:56:55,685 --> 0:56:57,93
Look kids, we're neato.


1374
0:56:57,93 --> 0:56:58,87
We're really neato.


1375
0:56:58,87 --> 0:57:0,28
Neato.


1376
0:57:0,28 --> 0:57:4,63
In the El Camino, I'm back,
yeah, tight like burrito.


1377
0:57:4,63 --> 0:57:6,47
Pull on the place,
a 10 cent casino.


1378
0:57:6,47 --> 0:57:9,835
Next year, I'm in the movie,
Quentin Tarantino.


1379
0:57:9,835 --> 0:57:12,65
Coast of Puerto Rico,
pizza Totino.


1380
0:57:12,65 --> 0:57:13,86
You got a low self-esteem?


1381
0:57:13,86 --> 0:57:15,62
You can rent my ego.


1382
0:57:15,62 --> 0:57:18,57
Neato, burrito, hold
the chorizo.


1383
0:57:18,57 --> 0:57:21,214
Snitches get stitches,
shout out to Lilo.


1384
0:57:21,214 --> 0:57:24,1
Fuck cocaine, my cock's
like a kilo.


1385
0:57:24,1 --> 0:57:27,467
And you know I be stacking
more dough than phyllo.


1386
0:57:27,467 --> 0:57:28,97
Your momma sucked my
dick, tell her,


1387
0:57:28,97 --> 0:57:29,91
keep it on the d-low.


1388
0:57:29,91 --> 0:57:30,85
I keep it underground.


1389
0:57:30,85 --> 0:57:32,73
You're commercial like Vevo.


1390
0:57:32,73 --> 0:57:35,31
Neato, neato, neat,
neat, neato.


1391
0:57:35,31 --> 0:57:37,99
Neato, neato, neat,
neat, neato.


1392
0:57:37,99 --> 0:57:39,145
We're neato.


1393
0:57:39,145 --> 0:57:41,3
Look Mom, we're neato.


1394
0:57:41,3 --> 0:57:42,17
Look kids, we're neato.


1395
0:57:42,17 --> 0:57:43,75
We're really neato.


1396
0:57:43,75 --> 0:57:46,668
Neato, neato, neat,
neat, neato.


1397
0:57:46,668 --> 0:57:48,12
Get it Andy, get it.


1398
0:57:48,12 --> 0:57:49,572
Throw it.


1399
0:57:49,572 --> 0:57:51,24
We're neato, we're neato.


1400
0:57:51,24 --> 0:57:52,476
Look Mom, we're neato.


1401
0:57:52,476 --> 0:57:55,38



1402
0:57:55,38 --> 0:57:57,27
Neato, butt naked in
the El Camino.


1403
0:57:57,27 --> 0:58:0,62
I'm white like Berry,
not brown like Nino.


1404
0:58:0,62 --> 0:58:3,86
Dirt Nasty, don't ask me what's
neat while I'm shitting


1405
0:58:3,86 --> 0:58:6,41
on the track like Waka
Flocka Seagulls.


1406
0:58:6,41 --> 0:58:9,54
Evil, don't look through the
peephole unless you want to


1407
0:58:9,54 --> 0:58:12,395
see your grandma sitting
on my meat pole.


1408
0:58:12,395 --> 0:58:14,85
Locked up in Chino, got shanked
by a Latino for a bag


1409
0:58:14,85 --> 0:58:16,44
for a bag of Hot Fritos.


1410
0:58:16,44 --> 0:58:17,68
My dick mas piquito.


1411
0:58:17,68 --> 0:58:20,85
Neato, still whip it like Devo
because my dick's short and


1412
0:58:20,85 --> 0:58:23,72
fat like Danny DeVito.


1413
0:58:23,72 --> 0:58:27,207
Barely legal, hotter than a
jalapeno, as she dropped to


1414
0:58:27,207 --> 0:58:28,95
her knees and did
the Tim Tebow.


1415
0:58:28,95 --> 0:58:31,95
Neato, neato, neat,
neat, neato.


1416
0:58:31,95 --> 0:58:34,95
Neato, neato, neat,
neat, neato.


1417
0:58:34,95 --> 0:58:36,332
We're neato, we're neato.


1418
0:58:36,332 --> 0:58:38,774
Look Mom, we're neato.


1419
0:58:38,774 --> 0:58:40,79
Look kids, we're neato.


1420
0:58:40,79 --> 0:58:43,6
Neato, neato, neat,
neat, neato.


1421
0:58:43,6 --> 0:58:46,46
Neato, neato, neat,
neat, neato.


1422
0:58:46,46 --> 0:58:49,18
We're neato, we're neato,
look Mom, we're neato.


1423
0:58:49,18 --> 0:58:51,83



1424
0:58:51,83 --> 0:58:54,24
Nik Nikateen, what, neato.


1425
0:58:54,24 --> 0:58:56,12
Going crazy out here.


1426
0:58:56,12 --> 0:58:57,6
Fuck you.


1427
0:58:57,6 --> 0:58:58,47
Tear that shit down.


1428
0:58:58,47 --> 0:58:58,94
Tear it down.


1429
0:58:58,94 --> 0:59:2,442
YouTube, I got a new video
on YouTube with a


1430
0:59:2,442 --> 0:59:3,6
picture of my dick.


1431
0:59:3,6 --> 0:59:5,24
It got 10 million views.


1432
0:59:5,24 --> 0:59:6,69
Tear all that shit down.


1433
0:59:6,69 --> 0:59:7,94
We love you, YouTube.


1434
0:59:7,94 --> 0:59:12,93



1435
0:59:12,93 --> 0:59:13,89
BEN SCHWARTZ: Owen Wilson.


1436
0:59:13,89 --> 0:59:14,81
OWEN WILSON: How you doing?


1437
0:59:14,81 --> 0:59:15,295
BEN SCHWARTZ: Vince Vaughn.


1438
0:59:15,295 --> 0:59:16,26
VINCE VAUGHN: How are you?


1439
0:59:16,26 --> 0:59:17,44
BEN SCHWARTZ: Come on,
baby, the hottest


1440
0:59:17,44 --> 0:59:18,64
comedy duo there is.


1441
0:59:18,64 --> 0:59:19,86
The heat from you guys.


1442
0:59:19,86 --> 0:59:20,995
Wedding Crashers, enormous.


1443
0:59:20,995 --> 0:59:23,33
What I'm trying to do is to get
you guys as the red hot


1444
0:59:23,33 --> 0:59:24,83
duo in a new movie.


1445
0:59:24,83 --> 0:59:25,28
What do you think?


1446
0:59:25,28 --> 0:59:26,21
You like this idea?


1447
0:59:26,21 --> 0:59:27,38
OWEN WILSON: Yeah,
it makes sense.


1448
0:59:27,38 --> 0:59:28,9
BEN SCHWARTZ: Vin?


1449
0:59:28,9 --> 0:59:29,3
VINCE VAUGHN: Do you
have a good idea?


1450
0:59:29,3 --> 0:59:30,5
BEN SCHWARTZ: I've got
a project for you


1451
0:59:30,5 --> 0:59:31,69
that you might love.


1452
0:59:31,69 --> 0:59:34,87
It's called "The Hobbit."
Enjoy it.


1453
0:59:34,87 --> 0:59:35,5
Read it.


1454
0:59:35,5 --> 0:59:36,326
OWEN WILSON: "The Hobbit."


1455
0:59:36,326 --> 0:59:37,19
BEN SCHWARTZ: "The Hobbit."


1456
0:59:37,19 --> 0:59:37,544
VINCE VAUGHN: I don't
understand what


1457
0:59:37,544 --> 0:59:38,28
you're talking about.


1458
0:59:38,28 --> 0:59:39,61
BEN SCHWARTZ: OK, buddy
comedy, right?


1459
0:59:39,61 --> 0:59:40,57
VINCE VAUGHN: It's not
a buddy comedy.


1460
0:59:40,57 --> 0:59:42,28
I don't want to step
on your feet here.


1461
0:59:42,28 --> 0:59:43,49
BEN SCHWARTZ: Hold up, you don't
want to step on what?


1462
0:59:43,49 --> 0:59:46,425
VINCE VAUGHN: Hold on.


1463
0:59:46,425 --> 0:59:47,66
BEN SCHWARTZ: So that's it.


1464
0:59:47,66 --> 0:59:48,85
So we got our movie.


1465
0:59:48,85 --> 0:59:49,646
Do I just say green light it?


1466
0:59:49,646 --> 0:59:49,99
VINCE VAUGHN: No.


1467
0:59:49,99 --> 0:59:50,7
I'm not doing "The Hobbit."


1468
0:59:50,7 --> 0:59:51,28
BEN SCHWARTZ: Sean, we'll
call you back.


1469
0:59:51,28 --> 0:59:52,53
So not "The Hobbit"?


1470
0:59:52,53 --> 0:59:53,94
Not "The Hobbit."
But tell me why.


1471
0:59:53,94 --> 0:59:55,26
Is it because of
a timing thing?


1472
0:59:55,26 --> 0:59:57,32
VINCE VAUGHN: I think,
look, I'm a tall guy.


1473
0:59:57,32 --> 0:59:58,5
And hobbits are small.


1474
0:59:58,5 --> 0:59:58,76
And it doesn't make any sense.


1475
0:59:58,76 --> 1:0:0,33
OWEN WILSON: I guess somebody
should let Eddie Murphy know


1476
1:0:0,33 --> 1:0:2,22
he can't play a clone.


1477
1:0:2,22 --> 1:0:4,23
And he can't play the white guy
in the barber shop scene


1478
1:0:4,23 --> 1:0:4,98
in "Coming to America."


1479
1:0:4,98 --> 1:0:6,76
BEN SCHWARTZ: And I would say
Dustin Hoffman's not a woman,


1480
1:0:6,76 --> 1:0:7,47
but he played Tootsie.


1481
1:0:7,47 --> 1:0:8,58
You can do this, VV.


1482
1:0:8,58 --> 1:0:9,11
You know what I mean?


1483
1:0:9,11 --> 1:0:10,7
OWEN WILSON: He does
raise a good point.


1484
1:0:10,7 --> 1:0:11,2
It's about dreaming.


1485
1:0:11,2 --> 1:0:12,55
That's what film's about.


1486
1:0:12,55 --> 1:0:13,3
VINCE VAUGHN: I understand,
Owen.


1487
1:0:13,3 --> 1:0:14,39
OWEN WILSON: We let ourselves
dream a little.


1488
1:0:14,39 --> 1:0:15,895
VINCE VAUGHN: It's not a buddy
comedy for me and you.


1489
1:0:15,895 --> 1:0:17,81
OWEN WILSON: You know
what hobbits have?


1490
1:0:17,81 --> 1:0:18,28
Heart.


1491
1:0:18,28 --> 1:0:19,48
BEN SCHWARTZ: Oh God.


1492
1:0:19,48 --> 1:0:20,6
OWEN WILSON: This
guy has heart.


1493
1:0:20,6 --> 1:0:21,63
BEN SCHWARTZ: Yeah,
what about that?


1494
1:0:21,63 --> 1:0:22,16
OWEN WILSON: And
he can play it.


1495
1:0:22,16 --> 1:0:23,11
BEN SCHWARTZ: So what
about that?


1496
1:0:23,11 --> 1:0:24,975
Let you heart shine and
become a tiny guy.


1497
1:0:24,975 --> 1:0:25,905
OWEN WILSON: I love the idea.


1498
1:0:25,905 --> 1:0:27,31
I love the idea of
playing Gandalf.


1499
1:0:27,31 --> 1:0:28,38
But throw out some
other ideas.


1500
1:0:28,38 --> 1:0:29,46
You're right, you're right.


1501
1:0:29,46 --> 1:0:30,33
BEN SCHWARTZ: You
know what it is?


1502
1:0:30,33 --> 1:0:31,59
Maybe do a period piece, huh?


1503
1:0:31,59 --> 1:0:32,29
About a president.


1504
1:0:32,29 --> 1:0:33,26
About the president.


1505
1:0:33,26 --> 1:0:33,8
OWEN WILSON: Lincoln.


1506
1:0:33,8 --> 1:0:34,5
BEN SCHWARTZ: Oh!


1507
1:0:34,5 --> 1:0:35,88
OWEN WILSON: Guess who's
from Illinois?


1508
1:0:35,88 --> 1:0:37,31
BEN SCHWARTZ: I can't imagine
it's Vince Vaughn.


1509
1:0:37,31 --> 1:0:37,65
OWEN WILSON: Yeah.


1510
1:0:37,65 --> 1:0:37,97
BEN SCHWARTZ: No, man.


1511
1:0:37,97 --> 1:0:38,915
VINCE VAUGHN: I just
don't think--


1512
1:0:38,915 --> 1:0:40,67
OWEN WILSON: You can't say
you're too big to play that.


1513
1:0:40,67 --> 1:0:42,43
BEN SCHWARTZ: Put this on for
me, just for a minute.


1514
1:0:42,43 --> 1:0:42,91
VINCE VAUGHN: No.


1515
1:0:42,91 --> 1:0:43,74
OWEN WILSON: Come on.


1516
1:0:43,74 --> 1:0:44,57
BEN SCHWARTZ: Oh!


1517
1:0:44,57 --> 1:0:46,33
Oh, do you hear that?


1518
1:0:46,33 --> 1:0:47,51
The office just turned oval.


1519
1:0:47,51 --> 1:0:48,93
I feel like I'm staring at
the president right now.


1520
1:0:48,93 --> 1:0:50,16
Just say four score.


1521
1:0:50,16 --> 1:0:52,17
OWEN WILSON: Although, how would
that be a buddy movie?


1522
1:0:52,17 --> 1:0:52,58
BEN SCHWARTZ: Easy.


1523
1:0:52,58 --> 1:0:53,99
John Wilkes Booth.


1524
1:0:53,99 --> 1:0:54,385
Abraham Lincoln.


1525
1:0:54,385 --> 1:0:56,6
VINCE VAUGHN: OK, John Wilkes
Booth and Abraham Lincoln were


1526
1:0:56,6 --> 1:0:56,8
not buddies.


1527
1:0:56,8 --> 1:0:57,685
One was an assassin.


1528
1:0:57,685 --> 1:1:0,67
OWEN WILSON: No, no, but
it gives us an arc.


1529
1:1:0,67 --> 1:1:1,63
It gives us some
place to go to.


1530
1:1:1,63 --> 1:1:3,16
BEN SCHWARTZ: OK, then we
re-route it, easily.


1531
1:1:3,16 --> 1:1:4,425
We make them roommates.


1532
1:1:4,425 --> 1:1:5,24
Makes them buddies.


1533
1:1:5,24 --> 1:1:6,36
VINCE VAUGHN: John Wilkes
Booth kills Lincoln.


1534
1:1:6,36 --> 1:1:7,27
It's not a buddy comedy.


1535
1:1:7,27 --> 1:1:8,55
BEN SCHWARTZ: Give me a
little improv maybe.


1536
1:1:8,55 --> 1:1:9,5
Maybe you guys lived together.


1537
1:1:9,5 --> 1:1:11,75
Give me some of that riff magic
you guys do when like,


1538
1:1:11,75 --> 1:1:14,78
Vinnie says like, uh, sarcastic,
and then Owen goes,


1539
1:1:14,78 --> 1:1:15,42
but I'm a hippie.


1540
1:1:15,42 --> 1:1:16,92
Give me some of that
stuff, OK?


1541
1:1:16,92 --> 1:1:18,3
You're Abraham Lincoln.


1542
1:1:18,3 --> 1:1:19,605
You've gotta smile for
me, Vinnie, Jesus


1543
1:1:19,605 --> 1:1:21,23
Christ, a tiny bit.


1544
1:1:21,23 --> 1:1:21,61
Use it.


1545
1:1:21,61 --> 1:1:22,4
That's great.


1546
1:1:22,4 --> 1:1:24,2
And then Owen, you're
John Wilkes Booth.


1547
1:1:24,2 --> 1:1:24,985
You can initiate it.


1548
1:1:24,985 --> 1:1:25,665
Is that impossible?


1549
1:1:25,665 --> 1:1:28,255
OWEN WILSON: Yeah, let's
try this one.


1550
1:1:28,255 --> 1:1:31,31
You know, I have a
big date tonight.


1551
1:1:31,31 --> 1:1:33,51
And I need my lucky hat.


1552
1:1:33,51 --> 1:1:34,72
I can't find it.


1553
1:1:34,72 --> 1:1:35,43
It's this hat.


1554
1:1:35,43 --> 1:1:36,27
Where would it be?


1555
1:1:36,27 --> 1:1:36,81
VINCE VAUGHN: Here's you hat.


1556
1:1:36,81 --> 1:1:37,36
Here's your hat, roommate.


1557
1:1:37,36 --> 1:1:37,86
Take it.


1558
1:1:37,86 --> 1:1:40,21
OWEN WILSON: Here we go.


1559
1:1:40,21 --> 1:1:41,3
And scene.


1560
1:1:41,3 --> 1:1:42,96
Yeah, OK, but now let
me play Gandalf.


1561
1:1:42,96 --> 1:1:43,45
BEN SCHWARTZ: Right into it.


1562
1:1:43,45 --> 1:1:44,41
OWEN WILSON: Give me a
better hat, though.


1563
1:1:44,41 --> 1:1:45,59
BEN SCHWARTZ: Gandalf, plop that
on and see what happens.


1564
1:1:45,59 --> 1:1:46,42
OWEN WILSON: OK, put this on.


1565
1:1:46,42 --> 1:1:47,726
BEN SCHWARTZ: Go, go, go.


1566
1:1:47,726 --> 1:1:48,92
VINCE VAUGHN: Honestly.


1567
1:1:48,92 --> 1:1:48,91
OWEN WILSON: Give me a pipe.


1568
1:1:48,91 --> 1:1:51,308
Because I'm going to smoke some
of that Buckshire weed.


1569
1:1:51,308 --> 1:1:52,7
OK.


1570
1:1:52,7 --> 1:1:58,52
Oh, oh, where's my little
hobbit friend?


1571
1:1:58,52 --> 1:1:59,175
BEN SCHWARTZ: Yeah,
talk like an old


1572
1:1:59,175 --> 1:1:59,845
Jewish man, that's good.


1573
1:1:59,845 --> 1:2:0,7
Good, good, good.


1574
1:2:0,7 --> 1:2:1,735
OWEN WILSON: Where's my
little hobbit friend?


1575
1:2:1,735 --> 1:2:2,75
BEN SCHWARTZ: And Vin, you enter
as the hobbit friend.


1576
1:2:2,75 --> 1:2:3,635
OWEN WILSON: Oh, there he is.


1577
1:2:3,635 --> 1:2:5,58
That's the biggest hobbit
I've ever seen.


1578
1:2:5,58 --> 1:2:8,9



1579
1:2:8,9 --> 1:2:9,37
BEN SCHWARTZ: Vin, yeah?


1580
1:2:9,37 --> 1:2:11,5
Should we just say yes
to this, or no?


1581
1:2:11,5 --> 1:2:11,32
Just tell me.


1582
1:2:11,32 --> 1:2:12,56
Let's put it on speaker phone.


1583
1:2:12,56 --> 1:2:14,4
VINCE VAUGHN: I just don't know
what we're doing here.


1584
1:2:14,4 --> 1:2:14,445
OWEN WILSON: Oh God.


1585
1:2:14,445 --> 1:2:17,71
It's so exhausting to just
like try and just be tap


1586
1:2:17,71 --> 1:2:19,7
dancing like Fred Astaire
and have this guy


1587
1:2:19,7 --> 1:2:20,92
be like Doctor No.


1588
1:2:20,92 --> 1:2:22,78
You're nothing without your
energy, your enthusiasm.


1589
1:2:22,78 --> 1:2:23,81
VINCE VAUGHN: I think
that it's crazy.


1590
1:2:23,81 --> 1:2:24,66
I think it's crazy.


1591
1:2:24,66 --> 1:2:25,49
I think I'm wasting my day.


1592
1:2:25,49 --> 1:2:25,97
BEN SCHWARTZ: Crazy good?


1593
1:2:25,97 --> 1:2:27,5
Finish your sentences.


1594
1:2:27,5 --> 1:2:28,0
VINCE VAUGHN: Crazy terrible.


1595
1:2:28,0 --> 1:2:28,98
BEN SCHWARTZ: Crazy
terrible, I know.


1596
1:2:28,98 --> 1:2:29,95
What about "48 Hours"?


1597
1:2:29,95 --> 1:2:31,13
VINCE VAUGHN: I love "48 Hours."
We're not going to


1598
1:2:31,13 --> 1:2:31,36
remake "48 Hours."


1599
1:2:31,36 --> 1:2:31,96
BEN SCHWARTZ: Of course
we're not.


1600
1:2:31,96 --> 1:2:33,27
We're going to make our own
original movie that has


1601
1:2:33,27 --> 1:2:34,59
nothing to do with
that, "41 Hours."


1602
1:2:34,59 --> 1:2:35,95
VINCE VAUGHN: Is there a camera
or something in here?


1603
1:2:35,95 --> 1:2:37,12
Is this a joke?


1604
1:2:37,12 --> 1:2:38,14
BEN SCHWARTZ: There is
a camera right there.


1605
1:2:38,14 --> 1:2:40,23
But it's for my wife to make
sure I'm not cheating on her.


1606
1:2:40,23 --> 1:2:41,64
It has nothing to do with
filming you guys.


1607
1:2:41,64 --> 1:2:42,66
I wouldn't cheat on her.


1608
1:2:42,66 --> 1:2:43,55
VINCE VAUGHN: Do you have
any original ideas?


1609
1:2:43,55 --> 1:2:43,94
BEN SCHWARTZ: I do.


1610
1:2:43,94 --> 1:2:45,0
VINCE VAUGHN: I love
your enthusiasm.


1611
1:2:45,0 --> 1:2:46,1
I don't mean to be a downer.


1612
1:2:46,1 --> 1:2:48,7
So far we have "The Hobbit,"
which I don't think is-- let's


1613
1:2:48,7 --> 1:2:48,93
just refresh.


1614
1:2:48,93 --> 1:2:50,5
Not a buddy comedy.


1615
1:2:50,5 --> 1:2:51,84
OWEN WILSON: Take the
dream, put it away.


1616
1:2:51,84 --> 1:2:53,67
VINCE VAUGHN: Lincoln, Lincoln,
Lincoln with John


1617
1:2:53,67 --> 1:2:54,56
Wilkes Booth?


1618
1:2:54,56 --> 1:2:55,28
Not a buddy comedy.


1619
1:2:55,28 --> 1:2:56,7
BEN SCHWARTZ: Not yet.


1620
1:2:56,7 --> 1:2:56,91
VINCE VAUGHN: Not ever.


1621
1:2:56,91 --> 1:2:57,46
BEN SCHWARTZ: We'll pass.


1622
1:2:57,46 --> 1:2:59,3
We'll pass.


1623
1:2:59,3 --> 1:3:0,56
VINCE VAUGHN: And now we're
talking about remaking "48


1624
1:3:0,56 --> 1:3:1,63
Hours" but making
it "42 Hours"?


1625
1:3:1,63 --> 1:3:3,62
BEN SCHWARTZ: Ooh, did
I already say that?


1626
1:3:3,62 --> 1:3:4,1
VINCE VAUGHN: Yeah.


1627
1:3:4,1 --> 1:3:4,4
BEN SCHWARTZ: Oh.


1628
1:3:4,4 --> 1:3:4,96
It's a great idea.


1629
1:3:4,96 --> 1:3:5,25
VINCE VAUGHN: No.


1630
1:3:5,25 --> 1:3:5,69
BEN SCHWARTZ: No, it isn't.


1631
1:3:5,69 --> 1:3:6,7
I'm kidding.


1632
1:3:6,7 --> 1:3:6,2
VINCE VAUGHN: OK.


1633
1:3:6,2 --> 1:3:8,6
So what we need is just some
simple kind of fun idea with a


1634
1:3:8,6 --> 1:3:10,39
fun world to go into, comedy.


1635
1:3:10,39 --> 1:3:12,8
I'm happy to hear an idea.


1636
1:3:12,8 --> 1:3:13,3
But I honestly gotta
get out of here.


1637
1:3:13,3 --> 1:3:14,4
BEN SCHWARTZ: But there's
no watch on your wrist.


1638
1:3:14,4 --> 1:3:14,86
VINCE VAUGHN: I know
there's not.


1639
1:3:14,86 --> 1:3:15,43
But I gotta get out of here.


1640
1:3:15,43 --> 1:3:17,14
BEN SCHWARTZ: Two friends, OK?


1641
1:3:17,14 --> 1:3:19,77
Already this is amazing, right,
that crash weddings.


1642
1:3:19,77 --> 1:3:22,746



1643
1:3:22,746 --> 1:3:24,24
VINCE VAUGHN: Let's go.


1644
1:3:24,24 --> 1:3:25,15
BEN SCHWARTZ: It was
great to see you.


1645
1:3:25,15 --> 1:3:25,8
Thanks for coming in.


1646
1:3:25,8 --> 1:3:27,87
We'll just reschedule.


1647
1:3:27,87 --> 1:3:28,25
OK.


1648
1:3:28,25 --> 1:3:30,763
Is this a no, or loosely
attached?


1649
1:3:30,763 --> 1:3:33,721
OWEN WILSON: Loosely attached.


1650
1:3:33,721 --> 1:3:34,971
BEN SCHWARTZ: Hey Owen.


1651
1:3:34,971 --> 1:3:43,732



1652
1:3:43,732 --> 1:3:46,708
VINCE VAUGHN: Thank you.


1653
1:3:46,708 --> 1:3:49,21
Thank you very much.


1654
1:3:49,21 --> 1:3:51,322
Thank you.


1655
1:3:51,322 --> 1:3:53,88
Very nice to be here at
the big show here.


1656
1:3:53,88 --> 1:3:54,62
And yes, it's true.


1657
1:3:54,62 --> 1:3:58,2
There was a lot of ideas thrown
at me and Owen after


1658
1:3:58,2 --> 1:4:1,26
"Wedding Crashers." And none of
them really made any sense.


1659
1:4:1,26 --> 1:4:3,45
It seems like there's a lot
of sequels and stuff.


1660
1:4:3,45 --> 1:4:6,88
So it's nice to actually have
an idea and a movie actually


1661
1:4:6,88 --> 1:4:7,59
about something.


1662
1:4:7,59 --> 1:4:8,94
And the movie's very funny.


1663
1:4:8,94 --> 1:4:10,68
But it's also very timely.


1664
1:4:10,68 --> 1:4:12,8
And it's very nice to
be with this crowd.


1665
1:4:12,8 --> 1:4:13,81
This is an attractive crowd.


1666
1:4:13,81 --> 1:4:15,6
This is a hungry crowd.


1667
1:4:15,6 --> 1:4:17,74



1668
1:4:17,74 --> 1:4:19,62
And this is a sexual crowd.


1669
1:4:19,62 --> 1:4:21,99
I know what's going on here.


1670
1:4:21,99 --> 1:4:22,58
I know what's going on.


1671
1:4:22,58 --> 1:4:24,24
All right, guys, thank
you very much.


1672
1:4:24,24 --> 1:4:26,55
I'm proud of you.


1673
1:4:26,55 --> 1:4:27,23
Thank you.


1674
1:4:27,23 --> 1:4:28,724
I mean it.


1675
1:4:28,724 --> 1:4:30,11
I'm proud of you.


1676
1:4:30,11 --> 1:4:31,1
Thank you.


1677
1:4:31,1 --> 1:4:32,26
Thank you.


1678
1:4:32,26 --> 1:4:56,65



1679
1:4:56,65 --> 1:4:57,55
ANDY SAMBERG: Hey.


1680
1:4:57,55 --> 1:5:1,71
So next up is a video written
by and starring a 2008 prime


1681
1:5:1,71 --> 1:5:4,7
time Emmy nominee for
outstanding guest actress in a


1682
1:5:4,7 --> 1:5:7,9
comedy series for her role
as Marcy Maven on "Monk."


1683
1:5:7,9 --> 1:5:9,4
JORMA TACCONE: You may
remember her from the


1684
1:5:9,4 --> 1:5:10,91
beginning of the show.


1685
1:5:10,91 --> 1:5:12,41
She's the queen of jeans.


1686
1:5:12,41 --> 1:5:13,79
AKIVA SCHAFFER: The
Hoodie McGoodie.


1687
1:5:13,79 --> 1:5:15,542
ANDY SAMBERG: The bee's knees.


1688
1:5:15,542 --> 1:5:18,23
JORMA TACCONE: The crocodile's
butt hole.


1689
1:5:18,23 --> 1:5:19,79
AKIVA SCHAFFER: The butterfly
effect herself.


1690
1:5:19,79 --> 1:5:21,55
ANDY SAMBERG: Sarah Silverman
and "The Perfect


1691
1:5:21,55 --> 1:5:24,544
Night." Get off me.


1692
1:5:24,544 --> 1:5:24,916
SARAH SILVERMAN: [SINGING]


1693
1:5:24,916 --> 1:5:31,53
Tonight is the night I'm
going to celebrate.


1694
1:5:31,53 --> 1:5:39,15
Stay at home, order in, watch
a movie, then masturbate.


1695
1:5:39,15 --> 1:5:42,508
And I'm not going
out to the club.


1696
1:5:42,508 --> 1:5:46,999
Like I've ever even
been to a club.


1697
1:5:46,999 --> 1:5:50,991
But I got a feeling this is
going to be a perfect night.


1698
1:5:50,991 --> 1:5:54,484



1699
1:5:54,484 --> 1:5:56,48
WILL.I.AM: It's a
perfect night.


1700
1:5:56,48 --> 1:5:57,977
It's a perfect night.


1701
1:5:57,977 --> 1:5:59,1
Tonight's the night.


1702
1:5:59,1 --> 1:5:59,9
It's going to be right.


1703
1:5:59,9 --> 1:6:0,561
It's the perfect night.


1704
1:6:0,561 --> 1:6:3,998
SARAH SILVERMAN: I'm staying
home by myself, don't need


1705
1:6:3,998 --> 1:6:4,98
anybody else.


1706
1:6:4,98 --> 1:6:8,908
It's just me, myself, and I
with my puppy by my side.


1707
1:6:8,908 --> 1:6:10,872
Got my phone for clever
Tweeting.


1708
1:6:10,872 --> 1:6:12,836
I just followed Michael
Keaton.


1709
1:6:12,836 --> 1:6:14,8
And I'm tired and I'm lazy.


1710
1:6:14,8 --> 1:6:16,94
Shit's about tonight
get crazy.


1711
1:6:16,94 --> 1:6:18,73
WILL.I.AM: Yeah, she walking
in sweatpants.


1712
1:6:18,73 --> 1:6:19,986
And she watering them plants.


1713
1:6:19,986 --> 1:6:22,99
And she ordering food because
she's not in the mood to wash


1714
1:6:22,99 --> 1:6:23,986
all them pans.


1715
1:6:23,986 --> 1:6:25,978
Now she taking a bong hit.


1716
1:6:25,978 --> 1:6:27,97
And she shaving her armpits.


1717
1:6:27,97 --> 1:6:29,962
Now she looking for
something that she


1718
1:6:29,962 --> 1:6:31,456
wanna watch on Netflix.


1719
1:6:31,456 --> 1:6:33,946
SARAH SILVERMAN: Tonight
is the night


1720
1:6:33,946 --> 1:6:37,432
I'm going to celebrate.


1721
1:6:37,432 --> 1:6:45,4
Stay at home, order in, watch
a movie, then masturbate.


1722
1:6:45,4 --> 1:6:47,89
And you won't find me
out at the store.


1723
1:6:47,89 --> 1:6:52,87
Because I'll never even
walk out the door.


1724
1:6:52,87 --> 1:6:57,352
But I got a feeling this is
going to be the perfect night.


1725
1:6:57,352 --> 1:7:0,838



1726
1:7:0,838 --> 1:7:2,83
Don't need no heavy bass.


1727
1:7:2,83 --> 1:7:3,826
WILL.I.AM: Like a club.


1728
1:7:3,826 --> 1:7:4,88
SARAH SILVERMAN: Just need
to watch my face.


1729
1:7:4,88 --> 1:7:5,23
WILL.I.AM: Scrub a dub.


1730
1:7:5,23 --> 1:7:6,632
SARAH SILVERMAN: Floss my
teeth, take a puff,


1731
1:7:6,632 --> 1:7:8,26
and brush my teeth.


1732
1:7:8,26 --> 1:7:9,62
Don't need no heavy bass.


1733
1:7:9,62 --> 1:7:10,8
WILL.I.AM: No bass.


1734
1:7:10,8 --> 1:7:11,7
SARAH SILVERMAN: This ain't
the time or place.


1735
1:7:11,7 --> 1:7:12,285
WILL.I.AM: No, it ain't.


1736
1:7:12,285 --> 1:7:15,127
SARAH SILVERMAN: I floss my
teeth then take a puff then I


1737
1:7:15,127 --> 1:7:16,265
brush my teeth.


1738
1:7:16,265 --> 1:7:16,72
WILL.I.AM: Teeth.


1739
1:7:16,72 --> 1:7:18,669
SARAH SILVERMAN: Drink some
coconut water because


1740
1:7:18,669 --> 1:7:20,88
hydration is so ill.


1741
1:7:20,88 --> 1:7:24,345
Then I have a Dove Sensation
and I give my dog his pill.


1742
1:7:24,345 --> 1:7:28,256
Almost ready for my beddie, put
some Palmer's on my skin.


1743
1:7:28,256 --> 1:7:32,6
Put a YouPorn on my iPhone and
I type my search words in.


1744
1:7:32,6 --> 1:7:39,102
Gang, amateur, cum,
high fives.


1745
1:7:39,102 --> 1:7:43,485
I got a feeling this is going
to be a perfect night.


1746
1:7:43,485 --> 1:7:46,894



1747
1:7:46,894 --> 1:7:50,303
I got a feeling this is going
to be a perfect night.


1748
1:7:50,303 --> 1:7:54,917



1749
1:7:54,917 --> 1:7:56,167
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.


1750
1:7:56,167 --> 1:8:1,5



1751
1:8:1,5 --> 1:8:3,906
I don't remember school
being this cool.


1752
1:8:3,906 --> 1:8:8,19
Does that say that?


1753
1:8:8,19 --> 1:8:11,41
It's an epic rap battle.


1754
1:8:11,41 --> 1:8:12,5
Sorry.


1755
1:8:12,5 --> 1:8:13,75
It's the Epic Rap Battles
of History.


1756
1:8:13,75 --> 1:8:27,26



1757
1:8:27,26 --> 1:8:28,649
SKRILLEX: My name is
Skrillex, man.


1758
1:8:28,649 --> 1:8:29,87
Welcome to the Devil's Den.


1759
1:8:29,87 --> 1:8:32,979
I'm a scary monster stomping
this bright and frilly pant.


1760
1:8:32,979 --> 1:8:35,849
You're a weirdo, wolfie, into
powdered wigs and poof.


1761
1:8:35,849 --> 1:8:39,106
And your cousin blew notes on
your little magic flute.


1762
1:8:39,106 --> 1:8:42,42
Your daddy makes the Jackson 5
look like "The Family Circus,"


1763
1:8:42,42 --> 1:8:43,5
you might have been a genius.


1764
1:8:43,5 --> 1:8:45,439
But you died broke
and worthless.


1765
1:8:45,439 --> 1:8:46,134
I'm rich.


1766
1:8:46,134 --> 1:8:49,138
My claim to fame is I'm a
playlist, I'm the A list.


1767
1:8:49,138 --> 1:8:50,7
You're the vainest.


1768
1:8:50,7 --> 1:8:51,939
Kiss my ass, Amadeus.


1769
1:8:51,939 --> 1:8:54,6
AMADEUS: Was that a verse or did
you just get the hiccups?


1770
1:8:54,6 --> 1:8:55,688
I'm a prodigy, son.


1771
1:8:55,688 --> 1:8:57,45
And I'm about to smack
a bitch up.


1772
1:8:57,45 --> 1:9:0,24
My music is 200 years old,
and it's still excellent.


1773
1:9:0,24 --> 1:9:2,869
Two more months, the world
will forget about your


1774
1:9:2,869 --> 1:9:3,337
Skrillexcrement.


1775
1:9:3,337 --> 1:9:6,377
Look at how you dress when you
dubstep out of the house.


1776
1:9:6,377 --> 1:9:9,66
You're an emo Steve Urkel and
you reek of deadmau5.


1777
1:9:9,66 --> 1:9:11,3
I am the world's greatest
composer.


1778
1:9:11,3 --> 1:9:13,912
No one knows what you are,
except a lonely little troll


1779
1:9:13,912 --> 1:9:15,689
who knows how to press
a space bar.


1780
1:9:15,689 --> 1:9:16,64
SKRILLEX: I attack, you decay.


1781
1:9:16,64 --> 1:9:18,24
Can't sustain my releases.


1782
1:9:18,24 --> 1:9:21,24
Sad chain, Wolfgang, Bangarang
you to pieces.


1783
1:9:21,24 --> 1:9:24,258
I'm a self-made man, you're
a slave to your pappa.


1784
1:9:24,258 --> 1:9:26,27
I'm a rock star.


1785
1:9:26,27 --> 1:9:27,866
Mix you with the bass
and the drop ya.


1786
1:9:27,866 --> 1:9:41,76



1787
1:9:41,76 --> 1:9:43,948
Global, my strobes glow
like Chernobyl.


1788
1:9:43,948 --> 1:9:45,932
Kids explode and get mobile.


1789
1:9:45,932 --> 1:9:47,42
No one even knows you.


1790
1:9:47,42 --> 1:9:49,404
I make the whole world move.


1791
1:9:49,404 --> 1:9:50,37
You play community theater.


1792
1:9:50,37 --> 1:9:53,43
I gained your same fame from
home on a blown out speaker.


1793
1:9:53,43 --> 1:9:55,553
AMADEUS: Oh yes, I heard
that EP, and see, I


1794
1:9:55,553 --> 1:9:56,37
transcribed it here.


1795
1:9:56,37 --> 1:9:59,79
Tell me, what comes after the
68th measure of diarrhea?


1796
1:9:59,79 --> 1:10:2,184
What kind of drugs does
it take to enjoy this?


1797
1:10:2,184 --> 1:10:2,646
No idea.


1798
1:10:2,646 --> 1:10:6,14
I've seen more complexity
in a couch from IKEA.


1799
1:10:6,14 --> 1:10:10,31
From piano to fortissimo, that
means soft to very loud,


1800
1:10:10,31 --> 1:10:12,2
because I'm guessing that
you didn't know.


1801
1:10:12,2 --> 1:10:14,87
Put down your Cubase and
pick up a real bow.


1802
1:10:14,87 --> 1:10:19,245
I rocked harder than you when
I was five years old!


1803
1:10:19,245 --> 1:10:20,73
MALE SPEAKER: Who won?


1804
1:10:20,73 --> 1:10:21,72
Who's next?


1805
1:10:21,72 --> 1:10:24,69
You decide.


1806
1:10:24,69 --> 1:10:31,62
Epic Rap Battles of History!


1807
1:10:31,62 --> 1:10:47,328
[APPLAUSE]


1808
1:10:47,328 --> 1:10:57,49
[HONKING NOISE]


1809
1:10:57,49 --> 1:10:59,13
MALE SPEAKER: YouTube sensation
Toby Turner.


1810
1:10:59,13 --> 1:11:1,72
Oh, I didn't know he was
going to be here.


1811
1:11:1,72 --> 1:11:4,66
Toby Turner!


1812
1:11:4,66 --> 1:11:6,13
TOBY TURNER: Hi.


1813
1:11:6,13 --> 1:11:9,91
This is a dramatic
song I wrote.


1814
1:11:9,91 --> 1:11:12,313
It's actually called
Dramatic Song.


1815
1:11:12,313 --> 1:11:14,728
Title just came to me.


1816
1:11:14,728 --> 1:11:18,6
It felt right.


1817
1:11:18,6 --> 1:11:24,22
This song sounds dramatic, but
I'm bad at writing the words.


1818
1:11:24,22 --> 1:11:26,81
If you don't speak English,
this probably


1819
1:11:26,81 --> 1:11:28,65
sounds pretty good.


1820
1:11:28,65 --> 1:11:31,2
You probably think I'm
singing about some


1821
1:11:31,2 --> 1:11:33,49
pretty serious stuff.


1822
1:11:33,49 --> 1:11:37,3
But in reality, I'm singing
about the lack of stuff I'm


1823
1:11:37,3 --> 1:11:38,6
singing about.


1824
1:11:38,6 --> 1:11:44,57
This part's intense and
emotional, as long as you


1825
1:11:44,57 --> 1:11:46,68
don't understand it.


1826
1:11:46,68 --> 1:11:50,93
Your foreign grandma would
love this song.


1827
1:11:50,93 --> 1:11:53,0
Please send it to her.


1828
1:11:53,0 --> 1:11:56,33
And she'll probably tell her
foreign friends about this


1829
1:11:56,33 --> 1:11:59,32
song her grandson or doctor
sent her today.


1830
1:11:59,32 --> 1:12:2,84
This song might hit charts in
a country if parts sounded


1831
1:12:2,84 --> 1:12:13,86
like Coldplay, if the chorus
sounds like Coldplay.


1832
1:12:13,86 --> 1:12:19,19
Then I put some la la la's
in there, la la la


1833
1:12:19,19 --> 1:12:22,438
la, la la la la.


1834
1:12:22,438 --> 1:12:24,38
Hopefully your foreign
grandma listens to


1835
1:12:24,38 --> 1:12:25,95
this song every day.


1836
1:12:25,95 --> 1:12:29,59
And if she asks you to translate
the lyrics, here's


1837
1:12:29,59 --> 1:12:30,87
what you say.


1838
1:12:30,87 --> 1:12:35,755
A perfect translation
does not exist.


1839
1:12:35,755 --> 1:12:39,65
Well, at least, not
in your language.


1840
1:12:39,65 --> 1:12:44,4
But if you must know,
well, picture this.


1841
1:12:44,4 --> 1:12:48,29
50 billion rainbows and the sun
is setting and the moon is


1842
1:12:48,29 --> 1:12:51,55
setting also, and you're
there in a gazebo.


1843
1:12:51,55 --> 1:12:55,66
And then God descends from
heaven and he gives you a


1844
1:12:55,66 --> 1:12:56,695
million dollars.


1845
1:12:56,695 --> 1:12:58,541
Take that feeling.


1846
1:12:58,541 --> 1:13:1,26
And put it into a song.


1847
1:13:1,26 --> 1:13:4,25
I could translate word
by word, but


1848
1:13:4,25 --> 1:13:5,37
that'd take too long.


1849
1:13:5,37 --> 1:13:7,87
And I've got stuff
to do, Grandma.


1850
1:13:7,87 --> 1:13:10,31
I don't have time for this.


1851
1:13:10,31 --> 1:13:12,69
You gotta trust me, Grandma.


1852
1:13:12,69 --> 1:13:18,74
This freaking song
is the shhh.


1853
1:13:18,74 --> 1:13:19,99
Thanks.


1854
1:13:19,99 --> 1:13:27,7



1855
1:13:27,7 --> 1:13:28,92
This is not another song.


1856
1:13:28,92 --> 1:13:32,26
It's just the intro to the
next performer, whose


1857
1:13:32,26 --> 1:13:33,61
name is John Dore.


1858
1:13:33,61 --> 1:13:38,7
John Dore, John Dore,
John Dore.


1859
1:13:38,7 --> 1:13:40,75
Ladies and gentlemen,
John Dore.


1860
1:13:40,75 --> 1:14:0,67



1861
1:14:0,67 --> 1:14:1,18
JOHN DORE: Wow.


1862
1:14:1,18 --> 1:14:2,52
What a beautiful introduction.


1863
1:14:2,52 --> 1:14:6,54
And to everyone out there
watching YouTube who aren't


1864
1:14:6,54 --> 1:14:10,17
watching the TV sets, the Ottawa
Senators did just tie


1865
1:14:10,17 --> 1:14:13,58
the game to put it
into overtime.


1866
1:14:13,58 --> 1:14:14,61
No one gives a shit.


1867
1:14:14,61 --> 1:14:16,38
I understand, I understand.


1868
1:14:16,38 --> 1:14:17,11
But I do.


1869
1:14:17,11 --> 1:14:18,48
I care about a lot of things.


1870
1:14:18,48 --> 1:14:21,62
And I don't know if you've ever
seen a video of a baby


1871
1:14:21,62 --> 1:14:25,37
giraffe getting born, but it's
the most horrifying thing


1872
1:14:25,37 --> 1:14:27,606
you'll ever see in your life.


1873
1:14:27,606 --> 1:14:29,1
It's not like the
mother helps.


1874
1:14:29,1 --> 1:14:30,1
Doesn't lie down.


1875
1:14:30,1 --> 1:14:32,16
The mother stands straight up.


1876
1:14:32,16 --> 1:14:35,37
It's like watching a baby fall
out a three story window.


1877
1:14:35,37 --> 1:14:38,52
And then have to fight its way
out of a gelatinous sac.


1878
1:14:38,52 --> 1:14:40,36
It's disgusting.


1879
1:14:40,36 --> 1:14:43,59
So I've written a song on behalf
of the baby giraffe.


1880
1:14:43,59 --> 1:14:44,9
And I hope you like it.


1881
1:14:44,9 --> 1:14:46,8
It's called Mama,
Bend Yo' Knees.


1882
1:14:46,8 --> 1:15:16,13



1883
1:15:16,13 --> 1:15:17,17
It needs lyrics.


1884
1:15:17,17 --> 1:15:17,84
There's no question.


1885
1:15:17,84 --> 1:15:19,94
But I like it.


1886
1:15:19,94 --> 1:15:22,91



1887
1:15:22,91 --> 1:15:24,818
That's a great song.


1888
1:15:24,818 --> 1:15:27,63
It really captures the spirit
of the baby giraffe.


1889
1:15:27,63 --> 1:15:31,9



1890
1:15:31,9 --> 1:15:35,91
When I was in the 11th grade,
was I in my friend Jeff's


1891
1:15:35,91 --> 1:15:38,8
basement, and did he give
me a bottle of beer?


1892
1:15:38,8 --> 1:15:39,22
Yes, he did.


1893
1:15:39,22 --> 1:15:40,33
Did I chug the beer?


1894
1:15:40,33 --> 1:15:41,52
Yes, I did.


1895
1:15:41,52 --> 1:15:43,63
Afterwards, Jeff started
laughing.


1896
1:15:43,63 --> 1:15:46,3
And I said, Jeffrey,
what amuses you so?


1897
1:15:46,3 --> 1:15:50,11
And true story, Jeff had put two
tabs of acid in my beer.


1898
1:15:50,11 --> 1:15:51,72
Fact.


1899
1:15:51,72 --> 1:15:53,64
For the next half hour,
I was fucking furious.


1900
1:15:53,64 --> 1:15:56,5
For the next six hours,
I was the Lizard King.


1901
1:15:56,5 --> 1:15:57,37
And that is also a fact.


1902
1:15:57,37 --> 1:15:58,17
It can be checked.


1903
1:15:58,17 --> 1:15:59,6
I'm not trying to be cute.


1904
1:15:59,6 --> 1:16:2,75
But then I had to explain to my
innocent, non-drug abusing


1905
1:16:2,75 --> 1:16:5,85
girlfriend Melissa that I'd just
taken two tabs of acid.


1906
1:16:5,85 --> 1:16:8,6
And that is this same thing as
trying to explain to someone


1907
1:16:8,6 --> 1:16:9,35
you're about to become
a werewolf.


1908
1:16:9,35 --> 1:16:10,6
There's no difference.


1909
1:16:10,6 --> 1:16:13,47



1910
1:16:13,47 --> 1:16:19,18
Melissa, you should go.


1911
1:16:19,18 --> 1:16:22,8
I'm going to be different
soon.


1912
1:16:22,8 --> 1:16:25,86
We never found her body.


1913
1:16:25,86 --> 1:16:26,96
No, you didn't let me finish.


1914
1:16:26,96 --> 1:16:29,12
We never found her body again.


1915
1:16:29,12 --> 1:16:30,74
Now, I don't have a lot
of time up here.


1916
1:16:30,74 --> 1:16:31,95
But I'll tell you this.


1917
1:16:31,95 --> 1:16:34,14
YouTube did ask me if
I would do one of my


1918
1:16:34,14 --> 1:16:36,22
classic YouTube jokes.


1919
1:16:36,22 --> 1:16:40,17
So here it is for you, one of
my classic YouTube jokes.


1920
1:16:40,17 --> 1:16:42,19
Last week, I went out
with a lovely lady.


1921
1:16:42,19 --> 1:16:46,101
And I used the date rape drug
for the first time.


1922
1:16:46,101 --> 1:16:47,25
But you know what?


1923
1:16:47,25 --> 1:16:50,61
It just made me really tired.


1924
1:16:50,61 --> 1:16:52,38
Like, I'm not taking
that pill again.


1925
1:16:52,38 --> 1:16:54,26
Part way through the date,
I'm getting drowsy.


1926
1:16:54,26 --> 1:16:57,27
It's like, I'm not going to get
any raping done like this.


1927
1:16:57,27 --> 1:16:58,83
I'm exhausted.


1928
1:16:58,83 --> 1:17:1,27
Classic YouTube joke.


1929
1:17:1,27 --> 1:17:1,79
But you know what?


1930
1:17:1,79 --> 1:17:3,7
It wasn't always that way.


1931
1:17:3,7 --> 1:17:5,64
That is the final edited
product, all right?


1932
1:17:5,64 --> 1:17:9,3
But it went through a lot of
different forms of evolution


1933
1:17:9,3 --> 1:17:11,52
to become that perfect,
concise joke.


1934
1:17:11,52 --> 1:17:13,52
And I thought for fun tonight,
I'd give you a couple of


1935
1:17:13,52 --> 1:17:15,44
examples of how that
joke used to go.


1936
1:17:15,44 --> 1:17:18,33
I remember the first time I told
it, it went like this.


1937
1:17:18,33 --> 1:17:19,44
Hey, everyone.


1938
1:17:19,44 --> 1:17:21,37
I went out with a
girl recently.


1939
1:17:21,37 --> 1:17:23,3
And I gave her--


1940
1:17:23,3 --> 1:17:26,73
or gave me, I gave her
the date rope, not


1941
1:17:26,73 --> 1:17:27,95
rope, rape, no, rope.


1942
1:17:27,95 --> 1:17:28,82
I wish I had a rope.


1943
1:17:28,82 --> 1:17:29,74
I'd strangle myself.


1944
1:17:29,74 --> 1:17:30,83
So it went like that
the first time.


1945
1:17:30,83 --> 1:17:31,59
Wasn't very good.


1946
1:17:31,59 --> 1:17:33,42
I was very nervous,
very young.


1947
1:17:33,42 --> 1:17:35,78
I remember one time, I was
performing in a pool hall.


1948
1:17:35,78 --> 1:17:38,68
And people were playing
billiards, and the


1949
1:17:38,68 --> 1:17:41,57
joke went like this.


1950
1:17:41,57 --> 1:17:43,38
Well, last week I went out
with a lovely lady.


1951
1:17:43,38 --> 1:17:44,83
And I used the date--


1952
1:17:44,83 --> 1:17:47,49



1953
1:17:47,49 --> 1:17:48,74
um--


1954
1:17:48,74 --> 1:17:50,54



1955
1:17:50,54 --> 1:17:51,54
sorry, sorry everyone.


1956
1:17:51,54 --> 1:17:53,26
Last week, I went out
with a lovely lady.


1957
1:17:53,26 --> 1:17:57,74
And I used the uh--
oh fuck, come on.


1958
1:17:57,74 --> 1:18:0,15
Guys, enough with
the billiards.


1959
1:18:0,15 --> 1:18:2,56
I'm trying to tell jokes
up here, all right?


1960
1:18:2,56 --> 1:18:3,66
Just leave it.


1961
1:18:3,66 --> 1:18:6,69
Professional on stage, OK?


1962
1:18:6,69 --> 1:18:7,87
Idiots.


1963
1:18:7,87 --> 1:18:10,62
Anyway, last week I went out
with a lovely lady and I used


1964
1:18:10,62 --> 1:18:12,105
the-- what are you doing?


1965
1:18:12,105 --> 1:18:13,95
Oh my God.


1966
1:18:13,95 --> 1:18:14,58
I didn't mean anything.


1967
1:18:14,58 --> 1:18:15,57
I didn't mean anything.


1968
1:18:15,57 --> 1:18:16,82
Ow.


1969
1:18:16,82 --> 1:18:20,52



1970
1:18:20,52 --> 1:18:21,51
MALE SPEAKER: Who's funny now?


1971
1:18:21,51 --> 1:18:22,995
JOHN DORE: I didn't mean it.


1972
1:18:22,995 --> 1:18:23,985
I didn't mean it.


1973
1:18:23,985 --> 1:18:26,46
I was just trying
to tell a joke.


1974
1:18:26,46 --> 1:18:27,742
Don't put that up my butt.


1975
1:18:27,742 --> 1:18:28,992
Don't put it up my butt.


1976
1:18:28,992 --> 1:18:31,71



1977
1:18:31,71 --> 1:18:33,198
Give me--


1978
1:18:33,198 --> 1:18:34,448
ahh!


1979
1:18:34,448 --> 1:18:40,6



1980
1:18:40,6 --> 1:18:43,0
CARLIE MARGOLIS: YouTube is the
latest video website to


1981
1:18:43,0 --> 1:18:45,11
jump into the original
programming arena.


1982
1:18:45,11 --> 1:18:47,98
The site recently announced its
first high profile long


1983
1:18:47,98 --> 1:18:50,94
form venture, a 13 episode
dramatic adaptation of the


1984
1:18:50,94 --> 1:18:53,6
popular video Turtle
Has Sex with Shoes.


1985
1:18:53,6 --> 1:18:55,52
Acclaimed director David Fincher
has signed on to


1986
1:18:55,52 --> 1:18:57,93
direct the hour long pilot,
which will reunite him with


1987
1:18:57,93 --> 1:19:0,57
Fight Club star Edward Norton,
who's been cast as a high


1988
1:19:0,57 --> 1:19:3,28
powered New York City attorney
who owns a turtle and a pair


1989
1:19:3,28 --> 1:19:4,6
of sneakers.


1990
1:19:4,6 --> 1:19:6,41
According to New York Times
media analyst David Carr,


1991
1:19:6,41 --> 1:19:8,18
quote, "This is the future
of television.


1992
1:19:8,18 --> 1:19:10,73
YouTube did extensive research
to find out what their users


1993
1:19:10,73 --> 1:19:11,32
want to see.


1994
1:19:11,32 --> 1:19:13,97
Turns out, it's 13 hours of a
turtle having sex with shoes


1995
1:19:13,97 --> 1:19:15,94
that you can watch in one
sitting." In addition to


1996
1:19:15,94 --> 1:19:18,33
Norton, the series will costar
Rosario Dawson as a


1997
1:19:18,33 --> 1:19:21,36
no-nonsense district attorney,
and Academy Award nominee Paul


1998
1:19:21,36 --> 1:19:23,92
Giamatti as the passionate,
grunting voice of the turtle


1999
1:19:23,92 --> 1:19:25,86
who has sex with Mr.
Norton's shoes.


2000
1:19:25,86 --> 1:19:28,24
When asked what attracted him to
this project, Fincher told


2001
1:19:28,24 --> 1:19:30,3
Rolling Stone, quote,
"This is the dream


2002
1:19:30,3 --> 1:19:31,28
come true for a filmmaker.


2003
1:19:31,28 --> 1:19:33,83
When I saw the original video,
my immediate thoughts were,


2004
1:19:33,83 --> 1:19:34,61
who is this turtle?


2005
1:19:34,61 --> 1:19:36,28
Why is it having sex
with this shoe?


2006
1:19:36,28 --> 1:19:37,62
Where is this taking place?


2007
1:19:37,62 --> 1:19:40,65
YouTube is allowing us to tell
a very dark, compelling story


2008
1:19:40,65 --> 1:19:41,8
here."


2009
1:19:41,8 --> 1:19:43,78
While the full 13 episode first
season won't be released


2010
1:19:43,78 --> 1:19:46,8
until this fall, YouTube
has unveiled a teaser


2011
1:19:46,8 --> 1:19:47,15
trailer for the show.


2012
1:19:47,15 --> 1:19:48,4
Let's take a look.


2013
1:19:48,4 --> 1:19:50,96



2014
1:19:50,96 --> 1:20:16,7



2015
1:20:16,7 --> 1:20:19,18
MALE SPEAKER: The great thing
about this next performer is


2016
1:20:19,18 --> 1:20:20,56
that he's next.


2017
1:20:20,56 --> 1:20:25,38
Oh yeah, plus, he's
like a magician.


2018
1:20:25,38 --> 1:20:26,63
Dang.


2019
1:20:26,63 --> 1:20:28,53



2020
1:20:28,53 --> 1:20:30,18
This is Justin Willman.


2021
1:20:30,18 --> 1:20:34,38



2022
1:20:34,38 --> 1:20:37,53
JUSTIN WILLMAN: What
is up, YouTube?


2023
1:20:37,53 --> 1:20:40,27
Ladies and gentlemen, I've
shrouded myself behind a dark


2024
1:20:40,27 --> 1:20:41,53
curtain to build suspense.


2025
1:20:41,53 --> 1:20:43,132
Can I get an ooh, ahh?


2026
1:20:43,132 --> 1:20:45,44
AUDIENCE: Ooh, ahh.


2027
1:20:45,44 --> 1:20:48,6
JUSTIN WILLMAN: There's a dude
in the second row with black


2028
1:20:48,6 --> 1:20:49,69
hair and a blue button
up shit.


2029
1:20:49,69 --> 1:20:52,99
What's your name, dude?


2030
1:20:52,99 --> 1:20:55,54
Dude?


2031
1:20:55,54 --> 1:20:56,85
Name, loud, what is it?


2032
1:20:56,85 --> 1:20:57,77
JESSE: Jesse.


2033
1:20:57,77 --> 1:20:58,89
JUSTIN WILLMAN: Jesse.


2034
1:20:58,89 --> 1:21:0,97
Jesse, you're about
to get magished.


2035
1:21:0,97 --> 1:21:4,92
Jesse, name any vegetable
or fruit.


2036
1:21:4,92 --> 1:21:7,26
JESSE: Strawberries.


2037
1:21:7,26 --> 1:21:8,6
JUSTIN WILLMAN: Strawberry?


2038
1:21:8,6 --> 1:21:9,36
JESSE: Yep.


2039
1:21:9,36 --> 1:21:10,61
JUSTIN WILLMAN: Shit.


2040
1:21:10,61 --> 1:21:13,854



2041
1:21:13,854 --> 1:21:17,574
Hello, what's up, YouTube?


2042
1:21:17,574 --> 1:21:20,34
How's it going?


2043
1:21:20,34 --> 1:21:22,986
This side, what's
up, this side?


2044
1:21:22,986 --> 1:21:24,236
This side?


2045
1:21:24,236 --> 1:21:27,414



2046
1:21:27,414 --> 1:21:28,92
Give it up for Jesse,
everybody.


2047
1:21:28,92 --> 1:21:31,73



2048
1:21:31,73 --> 1:21:33,0
One day, that's going
to kill, though.


2049
1:21:33,0 --> 1:21:34,52
Can you imagine?


2050
1:21:34,52 --> 1:21:35,87
Dude says banana?


2051
1:21:35,87 --> 1:21:36,59
That could have been tonight.


2052
1:21:36,59 --> 1:21:38,9
But Jesse is here.


2053
1:21:38,9 --> 1:21:41,56
Anyway, my name is
Justin Willman.


2054
1:21:41,56 --> 1:21:42,55
I am a magician.


2055
1:21:42,55 --> 1:21:44,15
This is great to be doing
a show in Los Angeles.


2056
1:21:44,15 --> 1:21:46,253
Los Angeles crowd, we're
feeling good?


2057
1:21:46,253 --> 1:21:50,6



2058
1:21:50,6 --> 1:21:53,4
Normally, I have to travel.


2059
1:21:53,4 --> 1:21:54,9
And you can imagine, being a
magician going through airport


2060
1:21:54,9 --> 1:21:57,53
security, it is complicated,
with like


2061
1:21:57,53 --> 1:21:58,88
banana suits and shit.


2062
1:21:58,88 --> 1:22:2,4
So I actually have a couple
handy tricks to speed up the


2063
1:22:2,4 --> 1:22:3,35
TSA process.


2064
1:22:3,35 --> 1:22:8,5
I take all my metal objects,
like my phone and my


2065
1:22:8,5 --> 1:22:13,59
watch and my ring.


2066
1:22:13,59 --> 1:22:15,98
And instead of having them on me
when I go through security


2067
1:22:15,98 --> 1:22:18,58
and setting off the metal
detector, what I do is I put


2068
1:22:18,58 --> 1:22:20,45
them in a TSA friendly
envelope.


2069
1:22:20,45 --> 1:22:24,27



2070
1:22:24,27 --> 1:22:30,64
We pop the watch in there,
and the ring in there.


2071
1:22:30,64 --> 1:22:31,31
Perfect.


2072
1:22:31,31 --> 1:22:32,97
And the phone, you want
to be careful not


2073
1:22:32,97 --> 1:22:34,26
to scratch the screen.


2074
1:22:34,26 --> 1:22:35,79
Now Jesse, do you travel much?


2075
1:22:35,79 --> 1:22:36,53
JESSE: Yeah.


2076
1:22:36,53 --> 1:22:37,39
JUSTIN WILLMAN: You do.


2077
1:22:37,39 --> 1:22:38,67
Awesome.


2078
1:22:38,67 --> 1:22:40,7
TSA, they don't have
a sense of humor.


2079
1:22:40,7 --> 1:22:42,65
So when you write not guns,
they assume it's guns.


2080
1:22:42,65 --> 1:22:43,77
And they take whatever
you just gave


2081
1:22:43,77 --> 1:22:47,86
them, and destroy it.


2082
1:22:47,86 --> 1:22:52,76



2083
1:22:52,76 --> 1:22:55,77
It's cool, though, because I
always still have my ring.


2084
1:22:55,77 --> 1:22:57,8
And I always still
have my watch.


2085
1:22:57,8 --> 1:22:59,15
And I always still
have my phone.


2086
1:22:59,15 --> 1:23:0,28
That's how I travel, people.


2087
1:23:0,28 --> 1:23:1,82
That's how I travel.


2088
1:23:1,82 --> 1:23:7,4



2089
1:23:7,4 --> 1:23:9,98
Magnets.


2090
1:23:9,98 --> 1:23:11,23
Magnets.


2091
1:23:11,23 --> 1:23:13,7



2092
1:23:13,7 --> 1:23:14,7
Pete Holmes, he's right.


2093
1:23:14,7 --> 1:23:17,1
Being a magician in
2013 is hard.


2094
1:23:17,1 --> 1:23:19,6
Like, when I was 14, I
used to do shows at


2095
1:23:19,6 --> 1:23:19,97
kids' birthday parties.


2096
1:23:19,97 --> 1:23:21,25
It was adorable, OK.


2097
1:23:21,25 --> 1:23:24,9
And I would close the show by
pulling a rabbit out of a hat.


2098
1:23:24,9 --> 1:23:25,26
People didn't care how
the trick worked.


2099
1:23:25,26 --> 1:23:26,59
They weren't trying
to bust me.


2100
1:23:26,59 --> 1:23:28,87
They were just happy there
was a rabbit there.


2101
1:23:28,87 --> 1:23:29,67
They wanted to pet it.


2102
1:23:29,67 --> 1:23:30,65
It's cute.


2103
1:23:30,65 --> 1:23:32,59
But if I did that now, I'd pull
the rabbit out of a hat


2104
1:23:32,59 --> 1:23:34,55
right here on this stage, you
guys would be like, psh, it's


2105
1:23:34,55 --> 1:23:35,0
up his sleeve.


2106
1:23:35,0 --> 1:23:35,85
There's a trap door.


2107
1:23:35,85 --> 1:23:37,1
How was the bunny treated?


2108
1:23:37,1 --> 1:23:40,5



2109
1:23:40,5 --> 1:23:42,21
And I think that audiences,
you guys, have been


2110
1:23:42,21 --> 1:23:44,49
desensitized partly because
of the iPhone.


2111
1:23:44,49 --> 1:23:45,86
This is a magical device
that's in our


2112
1:23:45,86 --> 1:23:46,7
pockets at all times.


2113
1:23:46,7 --> 1:23:47,78
It does miracles.


2114
1:23:47,78 --> 1:23:48,41
We take it for granted.


2115
1:23:48,41 --> 1:23:50,6
Like, I could hold this
thing up to a speaker,


2116
1:23:50,6 --> 1:23:51,56
it'll tell me the song.


2117
1:23:51,56 --> 1:23:52,39
That's magic.


2118
1:23:52,39 --> 1:23:53,75
10 years ago, I could've
closed with that.


2119
1:23:53,75 --> 1:23:55,29
That would've been awesome.


2120
1:23:55,29 --> 1:23:57,46
I can say, take me to
the YouTube show.


2121
1:23:57,46 --> 1:23:58,9
Using satellites, it'll
take me here.


2122
1:23:58,9 --> 1:24:0,63
Sometimes, it'll make
a phone call.


2123
1:24:0,63 --> 1:24:2,46
It's an amazing device.


2124
1:24:2,46 --> 1:24:3,73
So what I'd love
to do is this.


2125
1:24:3,73 --> 1:24:4,71
This is kind of improvised.


2126
1:24:4,71 --> 1:24:7,65
But I'm going to see if Siri, my
lovely assistant, can teach


2127
1:24:7,65 --> 1:24:8,47
us a magic trick.


2128
1:24:8,47 --> 1:24:10,74
We're going to merge the classic
art of magic in the


2129
1:24:10,74 --> 1:24:11,52
new world of technology.


2130
1:24:11,52 --> 1:24:12,97
And if you're with me,
give me a hell yes.


2131
1:24:12,97 --> 1:24:14,52
AUDIENCE: Hell yes.


2132
1:24:14,52 --> 1:24:14,59
JUSTIN WILLMAN: OK.


2133
1:24:14,59 --> 1:24:17,59
I'm going to patch in
my Bluetooth to the


2134
1:24:17,59 --> 1:24:19,62
sound system here.


2135
1:24:19,62 --> 1:24:22,21
All right, here we ago.


2136
1:24:22,21 --> 1:24:24,64
Hello, Siri.


2137
1:24:24,64 --> 1:24:25,89
SIRI: Hello, Justin.


2138
1:24:25,89 --> 1:24:28,39



2139
1:24:28,39 --> 1:24:32,17
JUSTIN WILLMAN: Can you teach
me a magic trick?


2140
1:24:32,17 --> 1:24:36,6
SIRI: Did you say, teach
me a magic trick?


2141
1:24:36,6 --> 1:24:37,937
JUSTIN WILLMAN: Yes,
you're amazing.


2142
1:24:37,937 --> 1:24:39,1
It's amazing.


2143
1:24:39,1 --> 1:24:40,21
SIRI: OK.


2144
1:24:40,21 --> 1:24:44,23
I will help you create a magic
trick using ordinary objects


2145
1:24:44,23 --> 1:24:46,9
in your vicinity.


2146
1:24:46,9 --> 1:24:49,15
JUSTIN WILLMAN: OK.


2147
1:24:49,15 --> 1:24:52,96
SIRI: What objects do
you have nearby?


2148
1:24:52,96 --> 1:24:57,26
JUSTIN WILLMAN: A cloth napkin,
banana, bottle of--


2149
1:24:57,26 --> 1:24:59,56
SIRI: Perfect.


2150
1:24:59,56 --> 1:25:2,82
We'll use the cloth napkin
and the bandana.


2151
1:25:2,82 --> 1:25:6,46



2152
1:25:6,46 --> 1:25:8,63
JUSTIN WILLMAN: Cloth
napkin and a banana.


2153
1:25:8,63 --> 1:25:10,96
Banana.


2154
1:25:10,96 --> 1:25:12,2
SIRI: Correct.


2155
1:25:12,2 --> 1:25:14,39
The bandana.


2156
1:25:14,39 --> 1:25:15,62
JUSTIN WILLMAN: Banana.


2157
1:25:15,62 --> 1:25:16,87
SIRI: Pick up the bandana.


2158
1:25:16,87 --> 1:25:19,93



2159
1:25:19,93 --> 1:25:23,0
Now fold the bandana in half.


2160
1:25:23,0 --> 1:25:26,24



2161
1:25:26,24 --> 1:25:27,35
JUSTIN WILLMAN: Banana.


2162
1:25:27,35 --> 1:25:28,62
SIRI: Trust me, Justin.


2163
1:25:28,62 --> 1:25:29,87
Fold it in half.


2164
1:25:29,87 --> 1:25:35,92



2165
1:25:35,92 --> 1:25:38,12
Now fold it one more time.


2166
1:25:38,12 --> 1:25:44,64



2167
1:25:44,64 --> 1:25:47,605
Take the folded bandana and
hide it in your left hand.


2168
1:25:47,605 --> 1:25:50,62



2169
1:25:50,62 --> 1:25:53,43
Remember to keep your hand held
in a natural position.


2170
1:25:53,43 --> 1:25:56,31



2171
1:25:56,31 --> 1:25:59,54
This is called palming.


2172
1:25:59,54 --> 1:26:2,22
Now that you have mastered
palming, we


2173
1:26:2,22 --> 1:26:4,63
are ready to begin.


2174
1:26:4,63 --> 1:26:6,31
Open up the folded bandana.


2175
1:26:6,31 --> 1:26:8,84



2176
1:26:8,84 --> 1:26:13,24
Show the audience it's a regular
bandana by waving it


2177
1:26:13,24 --> 1:26:14,49
up and down.


2178
1:26:14,49 --> 1:26:17,72



2179
1:26:17,72 --> 1:26:21,12
If an audience member does not
believe it is a real bandana,


2180
1:26:21,12 --> 1:26:25,38
allow him to wipe
his face on it.


2181
1:26:25,38 --> 1:26:26,89
JUSTIN WILLMAN: Jesse?


2182
1:26:26,89 --> 1:26:28,3
You good?


2183
1:26:28,3 --> 1:26:31,93
SIRI: Pick up the cloth napkin
and gather the corners


2184
1:26:31,93 --> 1:26:34,27
together, forming
a makeshift bag.


2185
1:26:34,27 --> 1:26:39,29



2186
1:26:39,29 --> 1:26:43,17
Using your free hand, fold the
bandana along the creases you


2187
1:26:43,17 --> 1:26:45,65
made earlier.


2188
1:26:45,65 --> 1:26:48,39
And drop it into the
makeshift bag.


2189
1:26:48,39 --> 1:26:52,56



2190
1:26:52,56 --> 1:26:56,1
From the outside of the napkin,
squeeze the bandana


2191
1:26:56,1 --> 1:26:57,64
into a small little ball.


2192
1:26:57,64 --> 1:27:1,56



2193
1:27:1,56 --> 1:27:6,61
What the audience didn't see is
that you never really put


2194
1:27:6,61 --> 1:27:10,49
the bandana into the
napkin at all.


2195
1:27:10,49 --> 1:27:15,21
You really kept it in
your left hand.


2196
1:27:15,21 --> 1:27:17,85
Remember palming?


2197
1:27:17,85 --> 1:27:19,72
JUSTIN WILLMAN: No.


2198
1:27:19,72 --> 1:27:21,805
SIRI: Now, make a
magical gesture.


2199
1:27:21,805 --> 1:27:29,32



2200
1:27:29,32 --> 1:27:33,28
For the big finale, fling open
the napkin and receive your


2201
1:27:33,28 --> 1:27:34,53
well-deserved applause.


2202
1:27:34,53 --> 1:27:41,318



2203
1:27:41,318 --> 1:27:42,806
JUSTIN WILLMAN: I'm
Justin Willman.


2204
1:27:42,806 --> 1:27:43,798
Thank you guys so much.


2205
1:27:43,798 --> 1:27:45,48
Good night.


2206
1:27:45,48 --> 1:27:48,262



2207
1:27:48,262 --> 1:27:49,75
MALE SPEAKER: Ladies
and gentlemen.


2208
1:27:49,75 --> 1:28:10,7



2209
1:28:10,7 --> 1:28:15,515
Ladies and gentlemen, a very
funny man named Jeffrey Ross.


2210
1:28:15,515 --> 1:28:29,77



2211
1:28:29,77 --> 1:28:31,215
JEFFREY ROSS: How about a
hand for the Availables?


2212
1:28:31,215 --> 1:28:34,396



2213
1:28:34,396 --> 1:28:35,328
What's up?


2214
1:28:35,328 --> 1:28:36,61
How you doing, YouTubers?


2215
1:28:36,61 --> 1:28:40,22



2216
1:28:40,22 --> 1:28:45,35
It's Comedy Week, W-E-A-K,
am I right?


2217
1:28:45,35 --> 1:28:46,34
Yeah.


2218
1:28:46,34 --> 1:28:48,4
I want to try something a
little bit different.


2219
1:28:48,4 --> 1:28:52,81
I want to try speed roasting
YouTube fans, volunteers from


2220
1:28:52,81 --> 1:28:53,94
the audience.


2221
1:28:53,94 --> 1:28:55,81
There's a stairwell
right here.


2222
1:28:55,81 --> 1:28:58,64
Anybody who wants to come
up, this is your chance.


2223
1:28:58,64 --> 1:29:0,2
I'll take as many people.


2224
1:29:0,2 --> 1:29:1,22
Just come on up right now.


2225
1:29:1,22 --> 1:29:2,74
Let's go, babe.


2226
1:29:2,74 --> 1:29:4,13
Come on.


2227
1:29:4,13 --> 1:29:5,9
Whoa, that might be too many.


2228
1:29:5,9 --> 1:29:7,255
Hold on.


2229
1:29:7,255 --> 1:29:9,16
The first, like, six.


2230
1:29:9,16 --> 1:29:11,715
Just fuck it, come
up, let's go.


2231
1:29:11,715 --> 1:29:13,34
OK, that's good.


2232
1:29:13,34 --> 1:29:14,56
OK, I think we got enough.


2233
1:29:14,56 --> 1:29:16,24
That's good, that's
good, that's good.


2234
1:29:16,24 --> 1:29:17,19
You have to come up.


2235
1:29:17,19 --> 1:29:18,18
But forget you guys.


2236
1:29:18,18 --> 1:29:19,42
No, it's too many.


2237
1:29:19,42 --> 1:29:19,965
It's too many.


2238
1:29:19,965 --> 1:29:21,79
It's OK.


2239
1:29:21,79 --> 1:29:22,95
All right, look at this.


2240
1:29:22,95 --> 1:29:24,33
Give it up for my volunteers.


2241
1:29:24,33 --> 1:29:25,824
Move down this way.


2242
1:29:25,824 --> 1:29:30,804



2243
1:29:30,804 --> 1:29:31,9
Look at this outfit.


2244
1:29:31,9 --> 1:29:33,722
Did you make this yourself?


2245
1:29:33,722 --> 1:29:35,11
NICOLE: Yes.


2246
1:29:35,11 --> 1:29:36,47
JEFFREY ROSS: What's
your name?


2247
1:29:36,47 --> 1:29:36,91
NICOLE: Nicole.


2248
1:29:36,91 --> 1:29:37,78
JEFFREY ROSS: Nicole?


2249
1:29:37,78 --> 1:29:39,7
I'm already fucking
bored with you.


2250
1:29:39,7 --> 1:29:39,955
Let's go with you.


2251
1:29:39,955 --> 1:29:41,63
Is this your friend
right here?


2252
1:29:41,63 --> 1:29:41,89
FEMALE SPEAKER: Nope.


2253
1:29:41,89 --> 1:29:42,47
JEFFREY ROSS: No?


2254
1:29:42,47 --> 1:29:43,32
Look at you.


2255
1:29:43,32 --> 1:29:44,78
Stand up, you two.


2256
1:29:44,78 --> 1:29:45,63
Look at that.


2257
1:29:45,63 --> 1:29:48,86
Two fives make a 10.


2258
1:29:48,86 --> 1:29:50,25
Speed roasting.


2259
1:29:50,25 --> 1:29:53,5
Come on, deal with it.


2260
1:29:53,5 --> 1:29:54,25
Look at you.


2261
1:29:54,25 --> 1:29:55,9
What's your name?


2262
1:29:55,9 --> 1:29:55,7
MELISSA: Melissa.


2263
1:29:55,7 --> 1:29:59,25
JEFFREY ROSS: Melissa, you're
almost fuckable.


2264
1:29:59,25 --> 1:30:1,21
Oh my God, look at that.


2265
1:30:1,21 --> 1:30:2,68
Your balls are hanging
down your skirt.


2266
1:30:2,68 --> 1:30:5,44



2267
1:30:5,44 --> 1:30:6,8
How you doing, sir?


2268
1:30:6,8 --> 1:30:7,26
MALE SPEAKER: Good.


2269
1:30:7,26 --> 1:30:8,5
JEFFREY ROSS: Look at you.


2270
1:30:8,5 --> 1:30:11,62
Steroids make you look
retarded, holy shit.


2271
1:30:11,62 --> 1:30:13,83
I never use the word retarded,
but it just seemed to fit with


2272
1:30:13,83 --> 1:30:16,3
you for some reason.


2273
1:30:16,3 --> 1:30:16,75
Nice shirt.


2274
1:30:16,75 --> 1:30:18,29
What, do you keep it in your
glove compartment?


2275
1:30:18,29 --> 1:30:20,21
Iron it once in a while.


2276
1:30:20,21 --> 1:30:21,2
How you doing, babe?


2277
1:30:21,2 --> 1:30:21,68
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good,
how are you?


2278
1:30:21,68 --> 1:30:23,36
JEFFREY ROSS: What's
going on with you?


2279
1:30:23,36 --> 1:30:24,17
FEMALE SPEAKER: Not much.


2280
1:30:24,17 --> 1:30:25,85
JEFFREY ROSS: Who
you here with?


2281
1:30:25,85 --> 1:30:26,52
FEMALE SPEAKER: You.


2282
1:30:26,52 --> 1:30:27,93
JEFFREY ROSS: Oh my God.


2283
1:30:27,93 --> 1:30:29,0
Look at you.


2284
1:30:29,0 --> 1:30:29,65
Wow.


2285
1:30:29,65 --> 1:30:31,24
I wouldn't fuck you
with his dick.


2286
1:30:31,24 --> 1:30:34,1



2287
1:30:34,1 --> 1:30:35,9
How you doing, sir?


2288
1:30:35,9 --> 1:30:36,5
What's going on?


2289
1:30:36,5 --> 1:30:37,8
Come over here.


2290
1:30:37,8 --> 1:30:37,92
Look at this.


2291
1:30:37,92 --> 1:30:42,52
Harry Potter's blonde
something.


2292
1:30:42,52 --> 1:30:44,43
Don't you tuck your shirt
in or something?


2293
1:30:44,43 --> 1:30:45,54
I don't know why.


2294
1:30:45,54 --> 1:30:49,53
I just want to beat you
up for some reason.


2295
1:30:49,53 --> 1:30:50,49
It's probably everything.


2296
1:30:50,49 --> 1:30:52,97
Look at you.


2297
1:30:52,97 --> 1:30:54,53
How you doing, babe?


2298
1:30:54,53 --> 1:30:56,34
Look at you, oh my God.


2299
1:30:56,34 --> 1:30:57,745
You're like a little
red headed Snooki.


2300
1:30:57,745 --> 1:31:0,41



2301
1:31:0,41 --> 1:31:2,96
You're like Cookie.


2302
1:31:2,96 --> 1:31:4,9
And who's this right here?


2303
1:31:4,9 --> 1:31:4,96
MCKENNA: I'm McKenna.


2304
1:31:4,96 --> 1:31:4,98
JEFFREY ROSS: McKenna?


2305
1:31:4,98 --> 1:31:5,81
MCKENNA: Yes.


2306
1:31:5,81 --> 1:31:7,1
JEFFREY ROSS: What's
your story?


2307
1:31:7,1 --> 1:31:9,66
MCKENNA: I'm sitting there,
and I'm here, and stuff.


2308
1:31:9,66 --> 1:31:11,21
I don't know.


2309
1:31:11,21 --> 1:31:13,441
JEFFREY ROSS: What do
you do all day?


2310
1:31:13,441 --> 1:31:15,7
MCKENNA: I don't know.


2311
1:31:15,7 --> 1:31:16,805
Shit.


2312
1:31:16,805 --> 1:31:18,29
JEFFREY ROSS: Shit?


2313
1:31:18,29 --> 1:31:20,925
Have you seen the two girls,
one cup videos?


2314
1:31:20,925 --> 1:31:24,1



2315
1:31:24,1 --> 1:31:24,48
Wow.


2316
1:31:24,48 --> 1:31:25,38
I have a video coming out.


2317
1:31:25,38 --> 1:31:28,34
It's called one guy, no cup.


2318
1:31:28,34 --> 1:31:30,93
I just jerk off for
two minutes.


2319
1:31:30,93 --> 1:31:32,0
How you doing, sir?


2320
1:31:32,0 --> 1:31:33,955
I loved you as the guard
in Schindler's List.


2321
1:31:33,955 --> 1:31:37,53



2322
1:31:37,53 --> 1:31:38,78
And who's this, your gardener?


2323
1:31:38,78 --> 1:31:41,49



2324
1:31:41,49 --> 1:31:43,845
Step up here, sir,
how you doing?


2325
1:31:43,845 --> 1:31:47,614
What's your story, illegal
immigrant?


2326
1:31:47,614 --> 1:31:50,68
MALE SPEAKER: Work for
Microsoft, that's about it.


2327
1:31:50,68 --> 1:31:51,94
JEFFREY ROSS: Microsoft?


2328
1:31:51,94 --> 1:31:56,59
You're making people's dicks
microsoft right now.


2329
1:31:56,59 --> 1:31:58,69
What do you do for Microsoft?


2330
1:31:58,69 --> 1:31:59,76
MALE SPEAKER: Play
video games.


2331
1:31:59,76 --> 1:32:1,52
JEFFREY ROSS: Play
video games?


2332
1:32:1,52 --> 1:32:3,39
That's your job?


2333
1:32:3,39 --> 1:32:7,43
You're the fucking coolest guy
in this fucking place, man.


2334
1:32:7,43 --> 1:32:9,76
And who's this lady wearing
a piano doily?


2335
1:32:9,76 --> 1:32:11,54
How you doing?


2336
1:32:11,54 --> 1:32:13,29
Does your grandma know
you stole the doily


2337
1:32:13,29 --> 1:32:15,66
off the grand piano?


2338
1:32:15,66 --> 1:32:19,54
You're very cute in, like,
a horror movie.


2339
1:32:19,54 --> 1:32:23,11



2340
1:32:23,11 --> 1:32:24,25
Here, come over here, sir.


2341
1:32:24,25 --> 1:32:25,34
This guy I know.


2342
1:32:25,34 --> 1:32:26,49
Is this Harley?


2343
1:32:26,49 --> 1:32:27,2
Good to see you.


2344
1:32:27,2 --> 1:32:31,158
Harley from Epic Meal
Time, oh my God.


2345
1:32:31,158 --> 1:32:32,8
Hold on a second, Harley.


2346
1:32:32,8 --> 1:32:35,66
And who's this, your sister?


2347
1:32:35,66 --> 1:32:36,86
How you doing, sir?


2348
1:32:36,86 --> 1:32:40,0
Sir, ma'am, I'm not really
sure what it is.


2349
1:32:40,0 --> 1:32:40,53
Are you OK?


2350
1:32:40,53 --> 1:32:43,542
I love you on the cover
of Mad magazine.


2351
1:32:43,542 --> 1:32:45,3
MAX: Thank you.


2352
1:32:45,3 --> 1:32:48,135
JEFFREY ROSS: What's your
name, Andy Milonakis?


2353
1:32:48,135 --> 1:32:49,0
MAX: It's Max.


2354
1:32:49,0 --> 1:32:49,45
JEFFREY ROSS: Max?


2355
1:32:49,45 --> 1:32:51,94
All right, take it easy, Max.


2356
1:32:51,94 --> 1:32:54,467
You have the biggest boobs on
this stage right now, do you


2357
1:32:54,467 --> 1:32:55,75
realize that?


2358
1:32:55,75 --> 1:32:58,19
Dude, Harley, step up
here for a second.


2359
1:32:58,19 --> 1:32:59,98
I'm such a fan of your
YouTube show.


2360
1:32:59,98 --> 1:33:2,656
Have you guys seen
Epic Meal Time?


2361
1:33:2,656 --> 1:33:3,906
Wow.


2362
1:33:3,906 --> 1:33:8,17



2363
1:33:8,17 --> 1:33:9,96
How long you been
doing that show?


2364
1:33:9,96 --> 1:33:11,96
HARLEY: Almost three
years now.


2365
1:33:11,96 --> 1:33:14,9
JEFFREY ROSS: What video
have you done that's


2366
1:33:14,9 --> 1:33:16,2
had the most hits?


2367
1:33:16,2 --> 1:33:19,48
HARLEY: We made a lasagna with
about 45 hamburgers from


2368
1:33:19,48 --> 1:33:21,79
different fast food
restaurants.


2369
1:33:21,79 --> 1:33:24,9
JEFFREY ROSS: How many people
have watched that video?


2370
1:33:24,9 --> 1:33:26,93
HARLEY: Either 15 million people
watched it, or three


2371
1:33:26,93 --> 1:33:28,28
million people watched
it five times.


2372
1:33:28,28 --> 1:33:29,92
I don't know.


2373
1:33:29,92 --> 1:33:30,18
JEFFREY ROSS: Wow.


2374
1:33:30,18 --> 1:33:34,43
That's more hits than Rihanna
took to the face.


2375
1:33:34,43 --> 1:33:37,68
It's fucking YouTube, relax.


2376
1:33:37,68 --> 1:33:38,89
That's so cool.


2377
1:33:38,89 --> 1:33:39,91
And you're kind of fat.


2378
1:33:39,91 --> 1:33:43,16
Do you eat a lot of
the shit you make?


2379
1:33:43,16 --> 1:33:46,8
HARLEY: Well, you know, we're
not so different, you and I.


2380
1:33:46,8 --> 1:33:48,68
Except I'm actually paid to
look like a fat slob.


2381
1:33:48,68 --> 1:33:49,93
You're just a fat slob.


2382
1:33:49,93 --> 1:33:54,693



2383
1:33:54,693 --> 1:33:56,9
I'm happy he's here, though.


2384
1:33:56,9 --> 1:33:57,91
Because now I'm not the only
person that smells like cake


2385
1:33:57,91 --> 1:34:0,4
frosting and Arby's.


2386
1:34:0,4 --> 1:34:4,366
JEFFREY ROSS: I'm getting
roasted by an Internet chef.


2387
1:34:4,366 --> 1:34:5,76
Wow.


2388
1:34:5,76 --> 1:34:8,17
HARLEY: I'd invite you to come
cook on our show, except our


2389
1:34:8,17 --> 1:34:9,94
set is within 1,000
feet of a school


2390
1:34:9,94 --> 1:34:11,685
yard, so I don't think--


2391
1:34:11,685 --> 1:34:13,665
JEFFREY ROSS: Not allowed
within 1,000 feet.


2392
1:34:13,665 --> 1:34:15,645
You got me on that one.


2393
1:34:15,645 --> 1:34:16,635
Thank you, Harley.


2394
1:34:16,635 --> 1:34:17,625
You're awesome, buddy.


2395
1:34:17,625 --> 1:34:19,605
How about a hand for
all my YouTube


2396
1:34:19,605 --> 1:34:21,585
fan volunteers, everybody?


2397
1:34:21,585 --> 1:34:22,575
Good sports.


2398
1:34:22,575 --> 1:34:24,6
Thank you.


2399
1:34:24,6 --> 1:34:25,5
Thank you.


2400
1:34:25,5 --> 1:34:26,85
All right, thank
you everybody.


2401
1:34:26,85 --> 1:34:28,1
I love you.


2402
1:34:28,1 --> 1:34:30,434



2403
1:34:30,434 --> 1:35:6,93



2404
1:35:6,93 --> 1:35:9,6
MALE SPEAKER: Ladies and
gentlemen, Tim and Eric.


2405
1:35:9,6 --> 1:35:15,915



2406
1:35:15,915 --> 1:35:17,34
TIM: Let's hear it, everybody.


2407
1:35:17,34 --> 1:35:18,29
Come on now.


2408
1:35:18,29 --> 1:35:19,72
We like lobster.


2409
1:35:19,72 --> 1:35:20,7
ERIC: This is great.


2410
1:35:20,7 --> 1:35:26,36
TIM: How many people out there
are big Red Lobster fans, huh?


2411
1:35:26,36 --> 1:35:30,752
How many people just can't
get enough Red Lobster?


2412
1:35:30,752 --> 1:35:34,41
Can you cut the music
now, please?


2413
1:35:34,41 --> 1:35:35,52
We're done with the
Red Lobster bit.


2414
1:35:35,52 --> 1:35:36,993
ERIC: Cut the fucking music.


2415
1:35:36,993 --> 1:35:37,975
TIM: Cut the music.


2416
1:35:37,975 --> 1:35:38,957
Stop the music.


2417
1:35:38,957 --> 1:35:40,921
ERIC: Cut it.


2418
1:35:40,921 --> 1:35:42,394
TIM: Stop the music.


2419
1:35:42,394 --> 1:35:43,376
ERIC: Cut it.


2420
1:35:43,376 --> 1:35:45,39
TIM: Come on, stop the
fucking music.


2421
1:35:45,39 --> 1:35:45,87
ERIC: Shit show.


2422
1:35:45,87 --> 1:35:49,51
TIM: Turn the fucking--
turn the music off.


2423
1:35:49,51 --> 1:35:50,77
Well, thank you guys so much.


2424
1:35:50,77 --> 1:35:52,64
So happy to be here, part
of Comedy Week.


2425
1:35:52,64 --> 1:35:53,98
What a great night it's been.


2426
1:35:53,98 --> 1:35:56,464
How much fun has
this been, huh?


2427
1:35:56,464 --> 1:35:57,955
ERIC: It's totally awesome.


2428
1:35:57,955 --> 1:35:59,45
TIM: Thanks, guys.


2429
1:35:59,45 --> 1:36:4,18
Now, I bet a lot of you guys are
wondering, what the hell?


2430
1:36:4,18 --> 1:36:5,2
Why are you guys so red?


2431
1:36:5,2 --> 1:36:6,65
Why are you holding lobsters?


2432
1:36:6,65 --> 1:36:9,88
Well, as you guys probably know,
this week we celebrate


2433
1:36:9,88 --> 1:36:11,62
100 years of Red Lobster.


2434
1:36:11,62 --> 1:36:13,692
It's been 100 years.


2435
1:36:13,692 --> 1:36:14,634
100 years.


2436
1:36:14,634 --> 1:36:16,2
ERIC: Tim, I cannot believe
how long it's been.


2437
1:36:16,2 --> 1:36:19,14
And you know, growing up, every
Friday, I would go to


2438
1:36:19,14 --> 1:36:20,36
Red Lobster with my family.


2439
1:36:20,36 --> 1:36:23,19
And on my birthday, my step
pappa would turn to me and say


2440
1:36:23,19 --> 1:36:25,9
son, why don't you upgrade
to the surf and turf?


2441
1:36:25,9 --> 1:36:27,67
TIM: Oh.


2442
1:36:27,67 --> 1:36:28,54
ERIC: It was awesome.


2443
1:36:28,54 --> 1:36:31,1
TIM: I knew this guy was
a surf and turf freak.


2444
1:36:31,1 --> 1:36:32,19
I knew it from the
moment I met him.


2445
1:36:32,19 --> 1:36:33,8
He loves surf and turf.


2446
1:36:33,8 --> 1:36:35,64
Well, Eric, you're going to be
so excited to find out that


2447
1:36:35,64 --> 1:36:38,62
this week, Red Lobster is
introducing, for the first


2448
1:36:38,62 --> 1:36:41,77
time ever, they're calling it
the endless summer all you can


2449
1:36:41,77 --> 1:36:42,69
eat surf and turf.


2450
1:36:42,69 --> 1:36:44,914
How many people would love
the sound of that?


2451
1:36:44,914 --> 1:36:47,404
ERIC: Holy shit!


2452
1:36:47,404 --> 1:36:49,55
Endless summer surf and
turf, just timed


2453
1:36:49,55 --> 1:36:51,144
for the real summer.


2454
1:36:51,144 --> 1:36:52,2
Ba ha!


2455
1:36:52,2 --> 1:36:53,26
Just in time for summer.


2456
1:36:53,26 --> 1:36:54,51
Ba ha!


2457
1:36:54,51 --> 1:36:57,205



2458
1:36:57,205 --> 1:36:59,44
TIM: I didn't realize the
timing was so perfect.


2459
1:36:59,44 --> 1:37:0,48
ERIC: Who writes this stuff?


2460
1:37:0,48 --> 1:37:1,924
Ba ha!


2461
1:37:1,924 --> 1:37:3,45
TIM: Thank you so much.


2462
1:37:3,45 --> 1:37:4,65
Well, Eric, that's true.


2463
1:37:4,65 --> 1:37:7,7
We are very excited about this
endless summer surf and turf.


2464
1:37:7,7 --> 1:37:8,49
ERIC: We really are.


2465
1:37:8,49 --> 1:37:11,8
You know, the good folks over
at Red Lobster are going to


2466
1:37:11,8 --> 1:37:14,71
blow the roof off of what you
and I think turf really is.


2467
1:37:14,71 --> 1:37:15,1
TIM: That's right.


2468
1:37:15,1 --> 1:37:16,99
Because you know, we all get
stuck in that paradigm where


2469
1:37:16,99 --> 1:37:19,27
we think that turf
means steak.


2470
1:37:19,27 --> 1:37:21,66
I love steak, no offense
to steak haters.


2471
1:37:21,66 --> 1:37:23,306
ERIC: Tim's a beef boy.


2472
1:37:23,306 --> 1:37:24,556
Ba ha!


2473
1:37:24,556 --> 1:37:27,13



2474
1:37:27,13 --> 1:37:28,57
Ba ha ha!


2475
1:37:28,57 --> 1:37:31,386
TIM: If you're going to go off
teleprompter, let me know.


2476
1:37:31,386 --> 1:37:32,636
ERIC: Ba ha ha!


2477
1:37:32,636 --> 1:37:35,63



2478
1:37:35,63 --> 1:37:37,39
TIM: No, but it's
true, though.


2479
1:37:37,39 --> 1:37:40,82
They're going to stop the way
you think about what turf is.


2480
1:37:40,82 --> 1:37:41,13
ERIC: Absolutely.


2481
1:37:41,13 --> 1:37:42,4
TIM: For example, if
you don't want


2482
1:37:42,4 --> 1:37:43,495
steak, you can get chicken.


2483
1:37:43,495 --> 1:37:44,84
Or you could get pork.


2484
1:37:44,84 --> 1:37:47,325
Hell, you can even
get Chinese food.


2485
1:37:47,325 --> 1:37:48,69
ERIC: Hold on, Tim.


2486
1:37:48,69 --> 1:37:51,37
What if I'm in the mood for some
succulent lob, but I also


2487
1:37:51,37 --> 1:37:53,18
want some Italian pizza pie?


2488
1:37:53,18 --> 1:37:55,87
TIM: Well, it's whatever your
heart desires, my old friend.


2489
1:37:55,87 --> 1:37:56,94
ERIC: Oh my God.


2490
1:37:56,94 --> 1:37:59,82
Tim, my desire right now is to
have an intimate table for two


2491
1:37:59,82 --> 1:38:2,32
with some of this endless summer
surf and turf by Red


2492
1:38:2,32 --> 1:38:3,26
Lobster right now.


2493
1:38:3,26 --> 1:38:6,35
TIM: Well, Eric, you're my
friend, my partner in life.


2494
1:38:6,35 --> 1:38:8,77
And I want to ask you to do
yourself a little favor.


2495
1:38:8,77 --> 1:38:11,77
Why don't you close your
eyes and make a wish.


2496
1:38:11,77 --> 1:38:14,5
ERIC: Please, put me on the
endless summer surf and turf.


2497
1:38:14,5 --> 1:38:15,49
Please, please.


2498
1:38:15,49 --> 1:38:17,264
TIM: Eric, you might want
to take a look.


2499
1:38:17,264 --> 1:38:19,212
ERIC: Oh, this is great.


2500
1:38:19,212 --> 1:38:20,462
Let's eat.


2501
1:38:20,462 --> 1:38:22,82



2502
1:38:22,82 --> 1:38:23,69
Thank you, Tim.


2503
1:38:23,69 --> 1:38:25,24
This is fantastic.


2504
1:38:25,24 --> 1:38:27,62
TIM: By the way, guys, we've got
a very special treat for


2505
1:38:27,62 --> 1:38:29,1
you guys, too.


2506
1:38:29,1 --> 1:38:30,39
Hit the music.


2507
1:38:30,39 --> 1:38:32,2
MALE SPEAKER: Ladies and
gentlemen, from the Black Eyed


2508
1:38:32,2 --> 1:38:33,27
Peas, it's Fergie.


2509
1:38:33,27 --> 1:38:49,943



2510
1:38:49,943 --> 1:38:50,442
FEMALE SPEAKER: [SINGING]


2511
1:38:50,442 --> 1:38:51,939
We were at a mall.


2512
1:38:51,939 --> 1:38:55,432
Me and my friends were
very hungry.


2513
1:38:55,432 --> 1:38:57,428
One wanted meat.


2514
1:38:57,428 --> 1:39:0,422
The other one wanted lobster.


2515
1:39:0,422 --> 1:39:5,412



2516
1:39:5,412 --> 1:39:6,662
Red Lobster.


2517
1:39:6,662 --> 1:39:10,901



2518
1:39:10,901 --> 1:39:12,151
Red Lobster.


2519
1:39:12,151 --> 1:39:26,869



2520
1:39:26,869 --> 1:39:31,859
Red Lobster, Red Lobster.


2521
1:39:31,859 --> 1:39:36,849



2522
1:39:36,849 --> 1:39:47,328
Red Lobster, Red Lobster, Red
Lobster, Red Lobster.


2523
1:39:47,328 --> 1:39:49,92



2524
1:39:49,92 --> 1:39:52,762
[APPLAUSE]


2525
1:39:52,762 --> 1:39:54,674
TIM: Thank you, guys.


2526
1:39:54,674 --> 1:39:56,586
Big round for Fergie, huh?


2527
1:39:56,586 --> 1:39:59,932



2528
1:39:59,932 --> 1:40:1,366
Thank you guys so much.


2529
1:40:1,366 --> 1:40:1,86
ERIC: Thank you from
Red Lobster.


2530
1:40:1,86 --> 1:40:4,8
TIM: And anybody can help
themselves to our leftovers.


2531
1:40:4,8 --> 1:40:8,16
Good night, everybody.


2532
1:40:8,16 --> 1:40:11,812
MALE SPEAKER: I like the way
they work it, no diggity.


2533
1:40:11,812 --> 1:40:14,555
I'd like to bag it up,
bag it up, boy.


2534
1:40:14,555 --> 1:40:17,61
I like the way you work
it, no diggity.


2535
1:40:17,61 --> 1:40:20,525
Like to bag it up,
bag it up now.


2536
1:40:20,525 --> 1:40:25,475



2537
1:40:25,475 --> 1:40:26,96
MALE SPEAKER: Should I go now?


2538
1:40:26,96 --> 1:40:30,92



2539
1:40:30,92 --> 1:40:32,63
Oh, sorry.


2540
1:40:32,63 --> 1:40:34,866
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dax Flame.


2541
1:40:34,866 --> 1:40:42,642



2542
1:40:42,642 --> 1:40:44,33
DAX FLAME: This is a quick
one that I wrote


2543
1:40:44,33 --> 1:40:45,58
about homeless people.


2544
1:40:45,58 --> 1:40:48,57



2545
1:40:48,57 --> 1:40:50,92
I gave a $10 bill to a
homeless woman in San


2546
1:40:50,92 --> 1:40:52,21
Francisco once.


2547
1:40:52,21 --> 1:40:54,66
It was my first day there, and
she had followed me from my


2548
1:40:54,66 --> 1:40:56,78
hostel and told me all this
stuff about how she was


2549
1:40:56,78 --> 1:40:59,62
pregnant, and how she also
currently had breast cancer


2550
1:40:59,62 --> 1:41:1,67
and AIDS and a sick husband.


2551
1:41:1,67 --> 1:41:4,13
I didn't know if she was lying
or if she was just a


2552
1:41:4,13 --> 1:41:5,39
hypochondriac.


2553
1:41:5,39 --> 1:41:7,38
But I gave her the money
just to be kind.


2554
1:41:7,38 --> 1:41:10,54
Another time, on that same San
Francisco trip though, I


2555
1:41:10,54 --> 1:41:13,42
bought a drink from a
convenience store for $3.99.


2556
1:41:13,42 --> 1:41:15,56
And the cashier gave
me a penny back.


2557
1:41:15,56 --> 1:41:18,62
And as I walked out the door of
the store, a homeless man


2558
1:41:18,62 --> 1:41:19,81
saw that I had change.


2559
1:41:19,81 --> 1:41:21,89
And he said, ooh, for me?


2560
1:41:21,89 --> 1:41:24,87
I smiled politely and began
to hand him the penny.


2561
1:41:24,87 --> 1:41:27,21
As I put it in his hand,
his expression changed.


2562
1:41:27,21 --> 1:41:29,45
And he yelled at me, oh,
an effing penny?


2563
1:41:29,45 --> 1:41:31,48
Get the eff out of here, man.


2564
1:41:31,48 --> 1:41:33,56
And I speed walked away
as fast as I could.


2565
1:41:33,56 --> 1:41:35,63
Because I didn't know if he
had a shiv or something.


2566
1:41:35,63 --> 1:41:37,68
He'd asked for the penny,
and then yelled at me.


2567
1:41:37,68 --> 1:41:38,68
It was because I had
unintentionally


2568
1:41:38,68 --> 1:41:40,17
gotten his hopes up.


2569
1:41:40,17 --> 1:41:42,45
And he was expecting more
than one lousy penny.


2570
1:41:42,45 --> 1:41:43,78
But what should I have done?


2571
1:41:43,78 --> 1:41:45,14
Just ignored him?


2572
1:41:45,14 --> 1:41:46,76
It's hard to know how to
navigate those kind of


2573
1:41:46,76 --> 1:41:48,27
situations.


2574
1:41:48,27 --> 1:41:50,45
Another time, a hobo asked me
for some money while I was


2575
1:41:50,45 --> 1:41:52,54
eating in the outdoor
area of a cafe.


2576
1:41:52,54 --> 1:41:54,61
And I offered him the cheese
off my sandwich, because I


2577
1:41:54,61 --> 1:41:55,89
wasn't going to eat
it anyways.


2578
1:41:55,89 --> 1:41:57,24
And I just thought
I'd ask, since he


2579
1:41:57,24 --> 1:41:58,77
told me he was hungry.


2580
1:41:58,77 --> 1:42:0,21
And he just gave me a look
like he wanted to


2581
1:42:0,21 --> 1:42:2,9
watch me die in a fire.


2582
1:42:2,9 --> 1:42:4,77
There was only ever one time
when a hobo tried to punch me.


2583
1:42:4,77 --> 1:42:6,86
Me and my parents were
just walking by.


2584
1:42:6,86 --> 1:42:9,19
And he was sitting there holding
a cup of change out.


2585
1:42:9,19 --> 1:42:12,17
I stopped, looked at him, and
he kind of smiled at me.


2586
1:42:12,17 --> 1:42:13,96
So I reached my hand
into the cup.


2587
1:42:13,96 --> 1:42:16,88
When he saw that I was about to
pull a fist full of change


2588
1:42:16,88 --> 1:42:19,58
out, he swatted my hand away
and tried to hit my face.


2589
1:42:19,58 --> 1:42:21,2
But I dodged his fist.


2590
1:42:21,2 --> 1:42:23,85
I was only 10 when that
happened, and not familiar


2591
1:42:23,85 --> 1:42:25,86
with the habits of homeless
people yet.


2592
1:42:25,86 --> 1:42:27,45
So that's why I didn't
realize he was


2593
1:42:27,45 --> 1:42:29,289
begging, and not offering.


2594
1:42:29,289 --> 1:42:35,776



2595
1:42:35,776 --> 1:42:38,52
MALE SPEAKER: One time
I was sad, and then I


2596
1:42:38,52 --> 1:42:39,77
watched these guys.


2597
1:42:39,77 --> 1:42:42,3



2598
1:42:42,3 --> 1:42:44,65
It's the Key of Awesome.


2599
1:42:44,65 --> 1:42:50,26



2600
1:42:50,26 --> 1:42:54,32
THE KEY OF AWESOME: Grab every
single one of your friends and


2601
1:42:54,32 --> 1:42:57,15
start a Mumford band.


2602
1:42:57,15 --> 1:42:59,4
Take a Mumford stand.


2603
1:42:59,4 --> 1:43:1,83



2604
1:43:1,83 --> 1:43:5,88
You don't need a drummer
in a Mumford band.


2605
1:43:5,88 --> 1:43:13,762
You just stomp your feet and
you clap your hands.


2606
1:43:13,762 --> 1:43:23,52
Oh, pack your bag, we're
going to Mumford land.


2607
1:43:23,52 --> 1:43:25,694
We got our own spoon man.


2608
1:43:25,694 --> 1:43:29,4



2609
1:43:29,4 --> 1:43:31,13
Excuse me, sir, I'd like
to know, where is


2610
1:43:31,13 --> 1:43:32,48
this Mumford land?


2611
1:43:32,48 --> 1:43:34,24
It's somewhere between
Limerick and


2612
1:43:34,24 --> 1:43:36,11
Williamsburg, Brookland.


2613
1:43:36,11 --> 1:43:39,86
So pull up your suspenders,
chug another jug of wine.


2614
1:43:39,86 --> 1:43:43,3
Tonight we're going to
party like it's 1899.


2615
1:43:43,3 --> 1:43:46,744
We strum on our guitars
so hard we break


2616
1:43:46,744 --> 1:43:47,84
our strummin' hands.


2617
1:43:47,84 --> 1:43:50,93
We use a toaster filter when
we post on Instagram.


2618
1:43:50,93 --> 1:43:54,71
We used to be the house band for
the "Antiques Road Show."


2619
1:43:54,71 --> 1:43:56,805
Someone sound the trumpets,
now let's do


2620
1:43:56,805 --> 1:43:57,94
some heys and ho's.


2621
1:43:57,94 --> 1:44:2,86
Ho's and heys, heys and ho's.


2622
1:44:2,86 --> 1:44:4,828
Three cheers for
the Lumineers.


2623
1:44:4,828 --> 1:44:7,288
They're a Mumford band.


2624
1:44:7,288 --> 1:44:8,764
And Phillip Phillips.


2625
1:44:8,764 --> 1:44:10,96
He's a Mumford man.


2626
1:44:10,96 --> 1:44:13,3
Well, he's more of
a Mumford kid.


2627
1:44:13,3 --> 1:44:19,263
We saw "O Brother, Where Art
Thou?" And said let's start a


2628
1:44:19,263 --> 1:44:20,69
band right now.


2629
1:44:20,69 --> 1:44:25,34
Our clothing and our songs
are hand me downs.


2630
1:44:25,34 --> 1:44:28,457
Spoon solo!


2631
1:44:28,457 --> 1:44:32,858
The way we play is pure
and honest, bordering


2632
1:44:32,858 --> 1:44:35,303
on weird and Amish.


2633
1:44:35,303 --> 1:44:40,682
Technology is what we abolish
in Mumford land, except for


2634
1:44:40,682 --> 1:44:42,149
our iPhones.


2635
1:44:42,149 --> 1:44:48,11
Because we're a Mumford band,
the oldest latest fad.


2636
1:44:48,11 --> 1:44:50,7
And Johnny Depp's a fan.


2637
1:44:50,7 --> 1:44:52,1
Laddie plays the washboard,
Wendel


2638
1:44:52,1 --> 1:44:54,13
plays the fipple flutes.


2639
1:44:54,13 --> 1:44:57,49
Bare knuckle boxing's how they
settle band disputes.


2640
1:44:57,49 --> 1:44:59,585
Emmett plays the juice
harp, and Neil


2641
1:44:59,585 --> 1:45:1,16
plays his own mustache.


2642
1:45:1,16 --> 1:45:4,76
Thaddeus the bar keep makes
us cocktails in a flask.


2643
1:45:4,76 --> 1:45:8,76
Joe scratches the Victrola
like an old timey DJ.


2644
1:45:8,76 --> 1:45:12,41
Jill's on social media, she
Twitters from the stage.


2645
1:45:12,41 --> 1:45:13,76
We got too many members.


2646
1:45:13,76 --> 1:45:16,46
Now the stage is caving in.


2647
1:45:16,46 --> 1:45:18,105
Can't tell where the
audience ends and


2648
1:45:18,105 --> 1:45:19,28
where the band begins.


2649
1:45:19,28 --> 1:45:22,118
Come on everyone,
clap your hands.


2650
1:45:22,118 --> 1:45:29,185
Start a Mumford band, the
oldest latest fad.


2651
1:45:29,185 --> 1:45:34,29
Start a Mumford band, the
oldest latest fad.


2652
1:45:34,29 --> 1:45:37,514



2653
1:45:37,514 --> 1:45:39,49
Hey ho!


2654
1:45:39,49 --> 1:45:40,74
Thank you very much.


2655
1:45:40,74 --> 1:45:51,87



2656
1:45:51,87 --> 1:45:54,5

lot of challenge videos.

testing the limits of

1:46:4,61 --> 1:46:6,7
marshmallows, you get the idea.


2664
1:46:6,7 --> 1:46:7,32

2665
1:46:7,32 --> 1:46:13,38

All right, we're going
to get started with


2667
1:46:14,24 --> 1:46:15,46
the cinnamon challenge.


2668
1:46:15,46 --> 1:46:17,526
But a doctor said you can
die if you do that.


2669
1:46:17,526 --> 1:46:19,51
So we're going to do the safe
cinnamon challenge.


2670
1:46:19,51 --> 1:46:21,246
That means, put the cinnamon
in your mouth and


2671
1:46:21,246 --> 1:46:21,99
just spit it out.


2672
1:46:21,99 --> 1:46:26,71
The YouTube Challenge Challenge
starts in 3, 2, 1.


2673
1:46:26,71 --> 1:46:31,41



2674
1:46:31,41 --> 1:46:34,23
All right, now the Bunny
Make Up Challenge.


2675
1:46:34,23 --> 1:46:37,502
For the next 10 seconds, put as
many marshmallows into your


2676
1:46:37,502 --> 1:46:40,484
mouth as you can grab.


2677
1:46:40,484 --> 1:46:44,293
All right, now apply the make
up in front of you on your


2678
1:46:44,293 --> 1:46:45,543

of a mirror.

1:46:45,543 --> 1:46:49,927



2680
1:46:49,927 --> 1:46:52,909
You have your 20 second
supernote, go.


2681
1:46:52,909 --> 1:47:1,358



2682
1:47:1,358 --> 1:47:3,843
And now we're moving on to
the baby food challenge.


2683
1:47:3,843 --> 1:47:5,334
Put your bib on.


2684
1:47:5,334 --> 1:47:6,584
Put the bib on.


2685
1:47:6,584 --> 1:47:9,807

Very carefully, grab one of
the tin cans from the

ingredients table.


2693
1:47:25,711 --> 1:47:28,196

sharp edge.

the spit take challenge.


2721
1:49:6,59 --> 1:49:8,49
So I'm raising awareness
for it.


2722
1:49:8,49 --> 1:49:10,62
RHETT: Yeah, but usually a spit
take is like a response


2723
1:49:10,62 --> 1:49:11,44
to something funny.


2724
1:49:11,44 --> 1:49:14,95
I haven't said any--


2725
1:49:14,95 --> 1:49:15,64
anything funny.


2726
1:49:15,64 --> 1:49:17,74
OK, I see how this is going.


2727
1:49:17,74 --> 1:49:18,27
OK.


2728
1:49:18,27 --> 1:49:20,22
You can accept the YouTube
spit take challenge by


2729
1:49:20,22 --> 1:49:23,49
uploading your creative version
of a spit take.


2730
1:49:23,49 --> 1:49:25,55
I know you're about
to do it again.


2731
1:49:25,55 --> 1:49:29,11
LINK: No, that one didn't
do anything for me.


2732
1:49:29,11 --> 1:49:30,89
RHETT: So make your own
spit take video.


2733
1:49:30,89 --> 1:49:33,42
Get creative with the liquids,
get creative with the setting.


2734
1:49:33,42 --> 1:49:36,38
And then make sure you upload it
with the title YouTube spit


2735
1:49:36,38 --> 1:49:37,63
take challenge.


2736
1:49:37,63 --> 1:49:45,37



2737
1:49:45,37 --> 1:49:46,62
2%?


2738
1:49:46,62 --> 1:49:48,61



2739
1:49:48,61 --> 1:49:49,87
2%?


2740
1:49:49,87 --> 1:49:52,61
LINK: Nope, whole, guaranteed
organic.


2741
1:49:52,61 --> 1:49:54,4
RHETT: OK, all right, good.


2742
1:49:54,4 --> 1:49:55,52
LINK: Listen, make sure you
don't have any liquid in your


2743
1:49:55,52 --> 1:49:58,8
mouth for this next guy, or
you will ruin your screen.


2744
1:49:58,8 --> 1:50:0,68
RHETT: Give it up for our final
performer of the night,


2745
1:50:0,68 --> 1:50:1,93
Hannibal Buress.


2746
1:50:1,93 --> 1:50:9,264



2747
1:50:9,264 --> 1:50:14,7
HANNIBAL BURESS: Yeah,
yeah, yes.


2748
1:50:14,7 --> 1:50:15,16
Yes.


2749
1:50:15,16 --> 1:50:16,41
Look at my suit.


2750
1:50:16,41 --> 1:50:19,256



2751
1:50:19,256 --> 1:50:21,59
I've been doing comedy
for a few years.


2752
1:50:21,59 --> 1:50:26,57
And one of my first big gigs,
I'm opening for Tracy Morgan


2753
1:50:26,57 --> 1:50:27,85
at this theater in Chicago.


2754
1:50:27,85 --> 1:50:29,87
Before the show started, I went
to his dressing room and


2755
1:50:29,87 --> 1:50:31,5
said, hey man.


2756
1:50:31,5 --> 1:50:35,53
How much time do you want me
to do before you go on?


2757
1:50:35,53 --> 1:50:36,72
That's a simple question
for the


2758
1:50:36,72 --> 1:50:37,81
opener to ask the headliner.


2759
1:50:37,81 --> 1:50:38,86
But he's such a weirdo.


2760
1:50:38,86 --> 1:50:41,16
Hey, just do a little time.


2761
1:50:41,16 --> 1:50:44,88
You'll be like the date rape
drug, and I'll be like the big


2762
1:50:44,88 --> 1:50:47,345
black dick.


2763
1:50:47,345 --> 1:50:50,396
Yo, how much time
is that, man?


2764
1:50:50,396 --> 1:50:52,36
Is that 15 minutes?


2765
1:50:52,36 --> 1:50:53,7
All right, I'll just do 15.


2766
1:50:53,7 --> 1:50:55,79
That's such a weird way to
think about time, man.


2767
1:50:55,79 --> 1:50:58,961



2768
1:50:58,961 --> 1:50:59,86
I drink.


2769
1:50:59,86 --> 1:51:1,375
That's my vice of choice
is drinking.


2770
1:51:1,375 --> 1:51:3,19
I don't smoke weed.


2771
1:51:3,19 --> 1:51:5,82
Because I get weird
when I smoke weed.


2772
1:51:5,82 --> 1:51:7,57
When I drink, I'm able
to be in the moment.


2773
1:51:7,57 --> 1:51:11,19
When I smoke weed, I overanalyze
the moment, which


2774
1:51:11,19 --> 1:51:13,0
is not good to do while
you're having sex.


2775
1:51:13,0 --> 1:51:14,92
Because if I'm drunk and having
sex, I'm thinking yeah,


2776
1:51:14,92 --> 1:51:15,77
this is cool.


2777
1:51:15,77 --> 1:51:18,94
But if I'm high and I'm having
sex, I'm thinking yo, why is


2778
1:51:18,94 --> 1:51:22,0
she letting me do this to her?


2779
1:51:22,0 --> 1:51:24,335
What was her childhood like?


2780
1:51:24,335 --> 1:51:26,43
What's her relationship
with her father?


2781
1:51:26,43 --> 1:51:28,96
Does she let everybody
smash this quick?


2782
1:51:28,96 --> 1:51:31,39
I start doing weird stuff, doing
high sex, like counting


2783
1:51:31,39 --> 1:51:32,15
my strokes.


2784
1:51:32,15 --> 1:51:36,44
And one, two, three and a four,
is she satisfied, five.


2785
1:51:36,44 --> 1:51:40,62



2786
1:51:40,62 --> 1:51:41,81
I tried cocaine in college.


2787
1:51:41,81 --> 1:51:44,24
It was too intense.


2788
1:51:44,24 --> 1:51:45,34
I went to this party coked up.


2789
1:51:45,34 --> 1:51:47,9
As soon as we got there, this
girl threw a beer in my


2790
1:51:47,9 --> 1:51:48,69
friend's face.


2791
1:51:48,69 --> 1:51:49,961
I freaked out.


2792
1:51:49,961 --> 1:51:51,885
Fucking slap that bitch, man.


2793
1:51:51,885 --> 1:51:53,41
She threw a beer on you,
now you slap her.


2794
1:51:53,41 --> 1:51:54,32
He said Hannibal, relax.


2795
1:51:54,32 --> 1:51:56,27
If I slap her, those five
dudes over there


2796
1:51:56,27 --> 1:51:57,77
going to kick my ass.


2797
1:51:57,77 --> 1:52:0,34
Yo, you just slap her.


2798
1:52:0,34 --> 1:52:2,72
I'll worry about the rest.


2799
1:52:2,72 --> 1:52:4,64
And I never want to feel
like that again.


2800
1:52:4,64 --> 1:52:7,1
There's no reason for me to be
telling a dude to slap a woman


2801
1:52:7,1 --> 1:52:8,44
and think I can beat
up five people.


2802
1:52:8,44 --> 1:52:10,22
That's not a necessary
sensation.


2803
1:52:10,22 --> 1:52:12,24
And I don't need it
in my life at all.


2804
1:52:12,24 --> 1:52:15,39
I probably couldn't beat
up five children.


2805
1:52:15,39 --> 1:52:17,5
One of them kick me in the
balls, I fall over.


2806
1:52:17,5 --> 1:52:17,75
They stomp on me.


2807
1:52:17,75 --> 1:52:20,256
It's a done deal.


2808
1:52:20,256 --> 1:52:23,69
But I'd be lying if I said that
cocaine hasn't brought


2809
1:52:23,69 --> 1:52:26,7
some beautiful moments
into my life.


2810
1:52:26,7 --> 1:52:28,13
When I was in Minneapolis, I
had a threesome with these


2811
1:52:28,13 --> 1:52:30,4
girls that were on cocaine.


2812
1:52:30,4 --> 1:52:31,36
I didn't think a threesome
was going to happen.


2813
1:52:31,36 --> 1:52:33,15
Because I thought the
fat one would leave.


2814
1:52:33,15 --> 1:52:35,37
But when life gives
you lemons, you


2815
1:52:35,37 --> 1:52:37,92
throw lemons at people.


2816
1:52:37,92 --> 1:52:39,65
I didn't want her to leave
because she was fat.


2817
1:52:39,65 --> 1:52:41,5
She just didn't seem that into
the whole situation at first.


2818
1:52:41,5 --> 1:52:44,68
But once the cocaine got
into her, turns out,


2819
1:52:44,68 --> 1:52:47,91
she was really cool.


2820
1:52:47,91 --> 1:52:49,16
I didn't do any cocaine
with them.


2821
1:52:49,16 --> 1:52:50,53
Because it can soften
up your dick.


2822
1:52:50,53 --> 1:52:53,26
And the last thing I need in
my hotel room is two angry,


2823
1:52:53,26 --> 1:52:55,644
coked out, horny girls yelling
at me, Hannibal,


2824
1:52:55,644 --> 1:52:56,43
what's wrong with it?


2825
1:52:56,43 --> 1:52:57,6
I don't know.


2826
1:52:57,6 --> 1:52:58,31
Can everybody just be quiet?


2827
1:52:58,31 --> 1:53:0,63



2828
1:53:0,63 --> 1:53:2,77
And then we had a good old
fashioned Midwestern night.


2829
1:53:2,77 --> 1:53:4,42
It was beautiful.


2830
1:53:4,42 --> 1:53:6,13
I wake up, the hotel room
was kind of trashed.


2831
1:53:6,13 --> 1:53:7,53
So I leave a nice tip
for housekeeping.


2832
1:53:7,53 --> 1:53:9,88
I go off to do morning radio.


2833
1:53:9,88 --> 1:53:10,85
I come back.


2834
1:53:10,85 --> 1:53:12,65
The room is cleaned perfectly.


2835
1:53:12,65 --> 1:53:14,4
They cleaned all around
the room.


2836
1:53:14,4 --> 1:53:15,82
They cleaned on the
kitchen counter.


2837
1:53:15,82 --> 1:53:18,67
Except they left a small
bump of cocaine.


2838
1:53:18,67 --> 1:53:20,77
And I say, that's extremely
professional hotel


2839
1:53:20,77 --> 1:53:22,48
housekeeping right there.


2840
1:53:22,48 --> 1:53:23,9
They love people.


2841
1:53:23,9 --> 1:53:25,74
And that's the type of attention
to detail that gets


2842
1:53:25,74 --> 1:53:29,35
you a five star Yelp
review right there.


2843
1:53:29,35 --> 1:53:32,21
I'll be back to that Residence
Inn, Marriott.


2844
1:53:32,21 --> 1:53:34,5
Three star hotel, five
star service.


2845
1:53:34,5 --> 1:53:36,52



2846
1:53:36,52 --> 1:53:39,7
I was in Vegas for
Fourth of July.


2847
1:53:39,7 --> 1:53:41,53
I see a billboard, comedian
Eddie Griffin


2848
1:53:41,53 --> 1:53:42,87
had a show in Vegas.


2849
1:53:42,87 --> 1:53:44,2
I said, oh man, that'd
be great.


2850
1:53:44,2 --> 1:53:44,81
That's one of the veterans.


2851
1:53:44,81 --> 1:53:46,1
That'd be awesome
to see him live.


2852
1:53:46,1 --> 1:53:47,74
But I go online to see how
much tickets were.


2853
1:53:47,74 --> 1:53:49,35
Tickets were $70.


2854
1:53:49,35 --> 1:53:51,49
I said shit, I don't like
Eddie Griffin that much.


2855
1:53:51,49 --> 1:53:54,44
That's a lot of money for
a comedy show, $70.


2856
1:53:54,44 --> 1:53:56,11
Because I don't want that
pressure over my head when I'm


2857
1:53:56,11 --> 1:53:56,71
watching the show.


2858
1:53:56,71 --> 1:53:58,59
Because I'll be thinking,
yeah, he funny.


2859
1:53:58,59 --> 1:54:0,83
But he ain't $70 funny.


2860
1:54:0,83 --> 1:54:2,54
He good, I don't know
about $70 good.


2861
1:54:2,54 --> 1:54:4,15
But I still want to
finagle a way in.


2862
1:54:4,15 --> 1:54:5,41
So I figured out a plan.


2863
1:54:5,41 --> 1:54:8,595
I'ma call the box office, act
like I'm my own agent, trying


2864
1:54:8,595 --> 1:54:10,5
to get tickets like that.


2865
1:54:10,5 --> 1:54:10,78
I call the box office.


2866
1:54:10,78 --> 1:54:11,2
Hello.


2867
1:54:11,2 --> 1:54:13,47
Who handles VIP complimentary
tickets?


2868
1:54:13,47 --> 1:54:15,36
I want to get some tickets
for my client to see


2869
1:54:15,36 --> 1:54:16,82
Eddie Griffin tonight.


2870
1:54:16,82 --> 1:54:18,75
And he said, what's your name?


2871
1:54:18,75 --> 1:54:21,35
And I hadn't thought of
a fake agent name yet.


2872
1:54:21,35 --> 1:54:22,61
They kind of put
me on the spot.


2873
1:54:22,61 --> 1:54:26,42
So reflexively I said,
Hannibal Buress.


2874
1:54:26,42 --> 1:54:27,93
I'm thinking, I just
messed up my hopes.


2875
1:54:27,93 --> 1:54:28,34
Dammit.


2876
1:54:28,34 --> 1:54:29,12
Because they don't know me.


2877
1:54:29,12 --> 1:54:30,34
And I can't say I'm
Hannibal Buress


2878
1:54:30,34 --> 1:54:31,98
represented by Hannibal Buress.


2879
1:54:31,98 --> 1:54:33,28
That sounds dumb.


2880
1:54:33,28 --> 1:54:34,48
They said, well, who
is your client?


2881
1:54:34,48 --> 1:54:35,24
I had to think quick.


2882
1:54:35,24 --> 1:54:38,92
I said, Donald Glover.


2883
1:54:38,92 --> 1:54:40,69
And I hang up the phone.


2884
1:54:40,69 --> 1:54:41,86
Now, I'm thinking that
they sensed the


2885
1:54:41,86 --> 1:54:42,43
bullshit in my voice.


2886
1:54:42,43 --> 1:54:44,3
Nothing's going to happen.


2887
1:54:44,3 --> 1:54:45,59
Five minutes later they
call back and say, how


2888
1:54:45,59 --> 1:54:47,442
many tickets you need?


2889
1:54:47,442 --> 1:54:50,78
I said, I need four tickets.


2890
1:54:50,78 --> 1:54:54,23
And then we went and
watched the show.


2891
1:54:54,23 --> 1:54:56,6
It was a good show.


2892
1:54:56,6 --> 1:54:57,95
It wasn't $70 good.


2893
1:54:57,95 --> 1:54:59,75
But it was a good show.


2894
1:54:59,75 --> 1:55:0,76
So now the show's over.


2895
1:55:0,76 --> 1:55:1,47
We're finishing our drinks.


2896
1:55:1,47 --> 1:55:3,99
And one of Eddie Griffin's
lackeys comes up to our table


2897
1:55:3,99 --> 1:55:7,6
and says, hey, you said that
Donald Glover was on TV shows


2898
1:55:7,6 --> 1:55:8,162
with Eddie Griffin.


2899
1:55:8,162 --> 1:55:10,1
Eddie don't know Donald, and
Donald's not even here.


2900
1:55:10,1 --> 1:55:11,85
I said, first of all, you
are adding stuff to


2901
1:55:11,85 --> 1:55:13,5
my lie right now.


2902
1:55:13,5 --> 1:55:14,63
I never said they
worked together.


2903
1:55:14,63 --> 1:55:17,39
I merely dropped the name and
the person at the box office


2904
1:55:17,39 --> 1:55:17,84
fell for it.


2905
1:55:17,84 --> 1:55:19,69
Second of all, the
show is over.


2906
1:55:19,69 --> 1:55:21,79
I don't know what you want
from me right now.


2907
1:55:21,79 --> 1:55:24,56
I can't vomit the comedy out
of my body back to you.


2908
1:55:24,56 --> 1:55:25,46
It's done, man.
