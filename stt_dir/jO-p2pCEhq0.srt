Hey its DJ BBQ here to grill, for your viewing
and eating pleasure, the ultimate steak - Rump


2
0:0:10,21 --> 0:0:14,9
Fillet.
Look at these beautiful bad boys man. Oh they're


3
0:0:14,9 --> 0:0:21,82
so good! And for half the price of Filet Mignon,
of Fillet. We're talking the rump, the bullet,


4
0:0:21,82 --> 0:0:26,529
the Cogal. Rump fillet man, Dutch Cogal. You
gotta spit the G.


5
0:0:26,529 --> 0:0:32,9
Haha.
First make sure you take your steaks out of


6
0:0:32,9 --> 0:0:37,7
the refrigerator at least 60 minutes before
you cook them. You want them to be room temperature.


7
0:0:37,7 --> 0:0:39,18
These things are thick and it's gonna take
a while.


8
0:0:39,18 --> 0:0:41,85
Now come over here, we're gonna get our butter
rocking.


9
0:0:41,85 --> 0:0:46,39
We've got our knife, stick it in the butter.
There we go.


10
0:0:46,39 --> 0:0:53,21
Mmmm, it's like a Popsicle full of heart attack.
There's our unsalted butter, we're gonna let


11
0:0:53,21 --> 0:0:58,85
it melt down and the fats from the butter
is gonna give us that caramelisation on the


12
0:0:58,85 --> 0:1:1,35
meat.
And in the meantime we're gonna sort out the


13
0:1:1,35 --> 0:1:4,65
steaks.
And that is with Sea Salt. You want them to


14
0:1:4,65 --> 0:1:10,44
melt onto the meat and right there is pepper.
Now, I used to use pepper but sometimes pepper


15
0:1:10,44 --> 0:1:15,1
can go acrid. They actually burn onto the steaks.
We're gonna put the pepper on at the very


16
0:1:15,1 --> 0:1:18,94
end when we let the steak rest so just salt,
real simple man.


17
0:1:18,94 --> 0:1:24,72
So do one side then turn them over. There's
a lot of surface area to rock and flavour.


18
0:1:24,72 --> 0:1:27,2
Butter is melted, let's get the steaks on
the grill.


19
0:1:27,2 --> 0:1:30,56
Oh yeah!
You guys ready?


20
0:1:30,56 --> 0:1:39,97
Here we go. You want a nice fierce, hot heat.
Proper hot heat. Feel that, oh yeah!


21
0:1:39,97 --> 0:1:43,15
Two steaks on the grill, we're gonna give
them a minute then flip them.


22
0:1:43,15 --> 0:1:47,31
So basically you wanna sear the outside and
keep it all juicy inside man.


23
0:1:47,31 --> 0:1:51,97
We want a beautiful flavour on the outside
and the char.


24
0:1:51,97 --> 0:1:59,64
That's one minute up, time to flip.
I cook my steak a minute a side, three flips.


25
0:1:59,64 --> 0:2:2,0
I like my steak medium-rare.


26
0:2:2,0 --> 0:2:6,1
Shake your rumpa.


27
0:2:6,1 --> 0:2:9,0
Oh that's a minute, sorry.
Right we've just done both sides, now we're


28
0:2:9,0 --> 0:2:14,79
doing the perimeter man, sealing all that juicy
flavour man. I might even work a couple of


29
0:2:14,79 --> 0:2:18,599
tongs dude 'cos I'm doing two steaks at once,
look at this. Ambidextrous! I'm going lefty,


30
0:2:18,599 --> 0:2:21,519
I'm going southpaw.
Alright we've sealed all the sides, now it's


31
0:2:21,519 --> 0:2:26,19
the turn of the herb brush.
So if you wanna know how to make this, just


32
0:2:26,19 --> 0:2:28,0
click on the herb brush.


33
0:2:28,0 --> 0:2:30,49
Ok, so we're gonna dip the herb brush into


34
0:2:30,49 --> 0:2:34,9
the butter and then we're gonna splash flavour
onto the steaks. And you see a bit of flare up.


35
0:2:34,9 --> 0:2:38,519
That's good man. That's gonna help us
give a beautiful char on the steaks.


36
0:2:38,519 --> 0:2:42,79
Once you've hit it with the herb brush, flip
it and hit it again for another minute.


37
0:2:42,79 --> 0:2:48,269
We're gonna kiss the steaks hahaha. So much
flavour!


38
0:2:48,269 --> 0:2:53,1
You know what, our steaks are good. The amount
of time you've used to cook your steaks, you're


39
0:2:53,1 --> 0:2:57,549
gonna use the same amount of time to rest
your steaks. Let all that moisture and that


40
0:2:57,549 --> 0:3:2,2
juicy goodness come back into that muscle
so that when you cut it open it's just juicy


41
0:3:2,2 --> 0:3:5,809
and beautiful.
I can see you guys like, come on I wanna eat!


42
0:3:5,809 --> 0:3:9,139
Uh uh, you gotta rest them, okay?!
Ok, so we're gonna take them over to the indirect


43
0:3:9,139 --> 0:3:13,489
side of the BBQ and we're gonna let them rest
for about 4 to 5 minutes alright.


44
0:3:13,489 --> 0:3:17,29
When they're resting, you add the pepper.
You get it on both sides.


45
0:3:17,29 --> 0:3:21,5
Let's get our steaks off the grill and mange!


46
0:3:21,5 --> 0:3:25,37
And we've got a beautiful, medium-rare cook


47
0:3:25,37 --> 0:3:30,1
rocking here just the way I like it.
That is perfect. Look at all those juices


48
0:3:30,1 --> 0:3:35,409
right there. Oh my goodness gracious.
Oh man these are beautiful. One for the camera


49
0:3:35,409 --> 0:3:37,439
guy.
You know what, I always eat first and I feel


50
0:3:37,439 --> 0:3:43,329
bad because you gotta film it all dude!
So listen, this goes to you.


51
0:3:43,329 --> 0:3:52,559
Alright, ready, 1,2,3. Ha ha, right?!
I'm happy to sit down.


52
0:3:52,559 --> 0:3:56,37
This rump fillet steak is perfect on its own
just with the herb brush and the butter and


53
0:3:56,37 --> 0:4:0,389
the salt and the pepper but if you wanna pimp
it out, I've got this beautiful Chimichurri


54
0:4:0,389 --> 0:4:5,749
sauce. You can drizzle it on there, give it
a bit of a tang, with the garlic and the coriander


55
0:4:5,749 --> 0:4:10,959
and the parsley. Oh and that vinegar will
just set it off!


56
0:4:10,959 --> 0:4:16,329
If you wanna learn how to make the Chimichurri
sauce click on the jar now. Just do yourselves


57
0:4:16,329 --> 0:4:20,6
a favour and click on it man. Chimmichurri,
beautiful on meat.


58
0:4:20,6 --> 0:4:24,4
