###5 <i>I've always been able</i> <i>to sleep through anything,</i>
###8 <i>Storms sirens you name it,</i> <i>Last night I didn't sleep,</i>
###14 <i>I guess I get a little goofy</i> <i>when I'm nervous,</i>
###20 <i>You see today isn't just any other day,</i>
###22 <i>It's my first day,</i>
###24 l'm the man.
###34 <i>Three years of pre-med</i> <i>and four years of med school</i>
###37 <i>have made me realise one thing,,,</i>
###39 Could you drop an NG tube on the patient in 234
###42 and then call the attending?
###44 <i>,,,I don't know Jack,</i>
###62 <i>So this is my story,</i>
###64 - l'm supposed to be in intensive care. - We just turfed him there.
###68 <i>I became a doctor to help people</i> <i>but orientation yesterday</i>
###71 <i>didn't really focus on patient care,</i>
###74 The hospital doesn't wanna be sued.
###76 Being sued is not a good thing.
###78 - Hey, Turk? - What's up?
###80 You know how l'm down with the rap music?
###82 Dude, be whiter.
###86 <i>Chris Turk's my best friend, We roomed</i> <i>together in college and med school,</i>
###90 <i>We even got accepted</i> <i>by the same hospital,</i>
###95 Here's the thing. Tupac, DMX, Dr Dre,
###97 in most of their songs, they use an extremely volatile racial slur.
###101 - The ''N'' word. - l got it.
###103 My question is this: if we're both singing along,
###106 and l would never use the word otherwise,
###109 - am l allowed to say... - No.
###111 That's good for me to know.
###113 Finally, doctors, if there is a mistake, don't admit it to the patient.
###119 Of course, if the patient is deceased, and you're sure,
###124 you can feel free to tell him or her anything.
###132 l found us an apartment.
###134 OK, gang, l'm Dr Bob Kelso, and l'm your Chief of Medicine,
###139 so l just want to encourage you all to think of me as your safety net.
###143 Because l promise you, we're a family here.
###147 Now, then, go get 'em, doctors.
###150 The surgical interns are gonna go grab a beer.
###153 The medical interns are having a Pac-Man tournament. We're all twelve.
###158 l love Pac-Man.
###159 Me, too. l love watching it, l love playing it, l love all of it.
###164 - l'm Elliot. - Ell-i-ot.
###167 Don't do that.
###169 l'm JD. This is Turk.
###171 Are you medical or surgical?
###173 Medical.
###175 <i>Hello,</i>
###177 Every male in my family is a doctor. That's why Dad gave me a guy's name,
###181 made me play sports, date girls. Joking.
###184 l know. l would've laughed if you'd paused.
###187 l know what you're thinking.
###189 <i>Your butt looks like</i> <i>two Pringles hugging,</i>
###192 - No, you don't. - l'm Miss ''Hyper-Competitive.''
###195 lt used to be a big problem for me. Used to. Past tense.
###202 Are we racing?
###203 Yes!
###205 <i>I'm not that desperate,</i>
###211 No!
###230 You do a lot of cardio?
###232 Oh, yes.
###233 Elliot Reid? John Dorian? Great.
###235 One, l am your resident, Dr Jeffrey Steadman. Not ''Jeff''.
###238 Two, here are your manuals.
###240 <i>Notice how quickly people</i> <i>make an impression?</i>
###243 l am a tool. l am a tool. l am a tool, tool, tool.
###245 - An unbelievably annoying tool. - Yeah.
###248 These are your beepers. From now on, they control your life.
###252 Thanks. Move it.
###253 <i>Back to today,</i>
###255 - l was paged. - First day, Bambi?
###258 Don't look at me when we're moving someone.
###261 Why?
###263 - We're waiting for Dr Cox. - Hi, doctor...
###266 - Place an lV for me. - We'll talk later.
###268 Carla, do you spray the perfume on or fill your bathtub up
###273 - and splash around in it? - l smell nice.
###276 <i>You've done this to cadavers,</i> <i>He's alive,</i>
###278 <i>Poke it through his skin, Now!</i>
###280 Time's up. Carla, will you do it for him?
###284 - Why tell her? - Shut up and watch.
###286 Be nice to Bambi.
###287 Why's he got to try and die every day during my lunch?
###290 That's insensitive.
###292 <i>Mistake,</i>
###294 Man's 92, has dementia, doesn't know we're here.
###297 He is inches from Carla's rack and hasn't flinched.
###300 - That is so sweet. - Yeah, it is.
###303 What about his subconscious?
###306 Eisenhower was a sissy.
###311 l think we're gonna be OK.
###313 From now on, whenever l'm in the room,
###316 you're definitely not allowed to talk.
###321 Dr Dorian, can you tell me what ailment most often...
###325 <i>Rounds is like being on a game show,</i>
###328 What is uraemia?
###329 That's my boy. Nice clean job on the Foley catheter.
###334 <i>I had a nurse do it,</i> <i>I'm still afraid to touch anybody,</i>
###339 <i>I've been thinking a lot about Elliot,</i> <i>A whole lot,</i>
###342 Dr Reid, you're late.
###344 l got puked on.
###346 You're off the hook if you can tell me what to look for in a uraemic patient.
###351 <i>Anyway I'm going for it,</i>
###352 - lnfection. - lnfection?
###355 That's my girl.
###357 Moving on.
###359 - l knew the answer. - l'm sure you did.
###361 - l'm just frazzled. - How could you not be?
###364 lf there's anything l can do for you...
###366 You could let me take you to dinner tomorrow night.
###370 Around seven?
###372 Or eight?
###373 Why not?
###375 Nice!
###376 <i>''Why not?'' That's what she said,</i>
###379 <i>''Why not?''</i>
###381 <i>Daddy why did you marry Mommy?</i>
###383 <i>Tiger I gave her</i> <i>an answer during rounds</i>
###386 <i>and she screwed my brains out,</i>
###389 <i>You're the man,</i>
###401 <i>What the hell are you doing?</i>
###405 Did you actually just page me
###406 to find out how much Tylenol to give to Mrs Lenzer?
###409 l was worried it could exacerbate...
###412 lt's regular-strength Tylenol. Here's what you do.
###415 Open her mouth, take a handful and throw it at her.
###419 Whatever sticks, that's the correct dosage.
###421 Under no circumstances are you to compromise our no-talking agreement.
###425 Dr Kelso is always saying...
###428 l'm gonna say this as carefully as possible,
###431 so l don't overstate it.
###433 Dr Kelso is the most evil human being on the planet
###436 and may in fact be Satan himself.
###440 lt's just that this isn't what l expected.
###443 Most of my patients are...
###446 older and sorta checked-out, mentally.
###450 Pumpkin, that's modern medicine.
###453 Advances that keep people alive who should've died a long time ago.
###458 Back when they lost what made them people.
###461 Your job is to stay sane enough so when someone does come in that you can help,
###465 you're not so braindead you can't function.
###467 For the love of God, what?
###471 Should we be talking about this in front of...
###474 Her? She's dead.
###476 Write this down. lf you push around a stiff,
###478 nobody'll ask you to do anything.
###481 You've been like a father to me.
###483 lf they find out nurses are doing your procedures,
###487 you'll be kicked out so quick, your head'll spin.
###490 <i>And there it is,</i>
###491 Have a terrific day.
###497 l'm not really dead.
###499 Bambi, here's Mrs Lenzer's tox screen.
###502 <i>Is Turk having</i> <i>the same experience I am?</i>
###504 - l am such a stud. - <i>Probably not,</i>
###507 l had my hands inside of a guy's chest.
###510 l couldn't even see them. l should not be allowed to do stuff like that.
###514 Wassup?
###516 - You weren't scared? - One way or another,
###518 everyone stops bleeding.
###520 - That is so deep. - No, it isn't.
###522 lt's a little deep.
###523 - About the apartment... - T-Man!
###528 Word up, boy, how you doing?
###530 - All right. - Todd, JD.
###531 - JD, this is my man Todd. - What's goin'...
###535 <i>I was back in high school,</i>
###538 <i>Surgical interns are all</i> <i>slice 'em and dice 'em,</i>
###540 <i>Medical interns are trained</i> <i>to think about the body,</i>
###543 <i>Diagnose test,</i> <i>Medical interns,,,</i>
###545 You got a stain.
###549 <i>,,,we're the chess club,</i>
###553 l just have bad gas. What are you testing me for?
###557 To see if your gas could be harmful to others.
###562 <i>He's just scared, Talk to him,</i>
###565 Look, Mr Burski, l heard a systolic murmur in your heart,
###569 which is most likely nothing, but if l don't check you out,
###572 - l'll worry about you all day. - Then l'll do it. For you.
###575 You're a good man.
###584 l'm waiting for someone.
###586 The door is broke. Probably the fifth time or so it don't open.
###590 Maybe a penny's stuck in there.
###592 - Why a penny? - l don't know.
###595 - Did you stick a penny in there? - No, l was making small talk.
###598 lf l find a penny in there, l'm taking you down.
###603 Welcome to rounds, kids.
###605 <i>Elliot is the only thing</i> <i>keeping me from losing my mind,</i>
###608 <i>She is my dream girl,</i>
###610 The necrosis and infected stool most likely indicate what, Dr Dorian?
###619 l don't know.
###622 Sir, l have no idea.
###624 Dr Reid, can you help him out?
###626 Superior mesenteric insufficiency.
###631 That's my girl. Patient number two.
###636 ''Superior mesenteric...''
###642 <i>Draining stomach fluid</i> <i>will get my spirits up,</i>
###644 - Circles for you. - Shut up and do it.
###647 <i>Fantastic, Now just suck out the fluid</i> <i>with the giant needle,</i>
###652 Needle's too big. l'm gonna get a nurse.
###654 Come on, man. Learn by doing.
###658 <i>Why couldn't I do that?</i> <i>I hated him at that moment,</i>
###664 OK, maybe the needle was a little too big.
###667 - You think? - What's going on?
###669 Nothing. This is totally normal.
###672 So are you gonna move your stuff in?
###675 That's why l came by. l think it's better if we both branched out.
###678 <i>Tell him that's stupid,</i> <i>Tell him you need him,</i>
###681 l feel the same way.
###690 What's it like being a young hotshot doctor?
###693 Did you ever go see a movie everyone told you was great
###696 and because of all the expectations, you were disappointed?
###700 Movies nowadays have too many special effects.
###703 That was my point.
###705 <i>My first code, Someone's heart fails</i> <i>they beep everyone,</i>
###709 <i>The first doctor in</i> <i>has to run the room</i>
###711 <i>decides if a patient lives or dies,</i>
###714 <i>What am I crazy?</i>
###718 You chicken.
###720 <i>Don't worry,</i> <i>Turk was there ''learning by doing'',</i>
###723 - Charged. - Clear.
###727 <i>The guy was just sleeping</i> <i>attached to a faulty monitor,</i>
###731 l thought we cared for each other.
###733 You just wanna sleep with me.
###735 l don't wanna sleep with you now.
###739 Do me right here.
###742 See?
###745 Right. Pass me a trach kit.
###749 Thanks.
###752 Our date is totally cancelled.
###759 <i>I was sitting on the floor</i> <i>for two reasons,</i>
###761 <i>One I tried to lock Elliot in that</i> <i>supply closet and she kicked me, Hard,</i>
###765 <i>And two the on-call room was locked,</i>
###769 Come on, l got ten minutes to sleep.
###772 Wait.
###773 Tell me if l'm going too fast, OK?
###775 Lose the clothes.
###780 <i>I heard Turk</i> <i>was gonna move in with Todd,</i>
###782 <i>I'm surprised that freak</i> <i>isn't in there with him,</i>
###785 Damn, this is hot.
###788 Nice.
###789 Your turn.
###791 No, l gotta get back, but very nice.
###795 Hey, Bambi.
###798 l'll call you, OK?
###800 Give me a big ''ahh''.
###802 A big-boy ''ahh''.
###804 Turk almost had sex in the on-call room.
###806 You realise, of course, l have no idea who Turk is,
###809 but good for him.
###812 You see, Billy, it turns out that sex is life-affirming.
###816 What do you say? Got a urine sample for me?
###819 l just did five minutes ago.
###821 But here's the thing.
###822 Take this, put it on the ground, close your eyes and go nuts. What do you say?
###827 - Cool! - Attaboy. Go get 'em.
###831 - Why are you here? - Seems like a good kid.
###833 You're worried about being on call tonight.
###836 <i>Yeah,</i>
###838 Look, worst-case scenario,
###841 you kill somebody,
###842 and it's with you the rest of your life.
###845 But that is the absolute worst-case scenario.
###848 Just have the nurses do the stuff you're too chicken to do,
###851 which is everything, and if you have a really rough admission...
###855 Call you?
###856 No! Hide in the closet again.
###859 This is fun.
###861 - Nurse? - l'm a doctor.
###863 The stethoscope, the beeper, a doctor, got it?
###866 Relax.
###867 l hate the ''darlings'', the ''sweethearts''.
###869 No need to tell me how hard it is being a woman here.
###872 You're helping by wearing a thong and hooking up in the on-call room.
###878 Word gets around.
###879 You talk like that, do you even know my name?
###882 l spend every second of my life either here or taking care of my mom,
###886 so, yeah, maybe l needed a little closeness.
###888 You never had a quickie at the club, right?
###891 Or snuck some skinny college boy up to your sorority room.
###894 And my thong? l think it makes my ass look good.
###897 And some days, l need to feel good about something.
###900 And you judge me? Well, guess what?
###902 Word does get around, Ms Out-For-Herself.
###905 So you can dump on everyone here if you want, but you will not hurt me.
###914 Her name's Carla, by the way.
###932 Hey, champ. First night on call starts soon, huh?
###936 You must be excited.
###939 You betcha.
###940 About Mrs Pratt.
###944 l heard you wanted to put her on the hospital's transplant list.
###948 l'd recommend keeping her on dialysis a little longer.
###951 - Maybe we'll get lucky. - No problem, sir.
###954 Great. Have a ball.
###955 On call.
###957 Little poem for ya.
###1004 Bambi, let's go.
###1013 l'll check on you every ten minutes, Mrs Marino, OK?
###1017 l need to see you in Mr Burski's room.
###1019 Are you flirting with me?
###1022 You are, aren't you?
###1025 He crashed. The attending thinks it was a pulmonary embolism.
###1029 No way anyone could've caught it.
###1031 - You have to pronounce him. - Why didn't anybody page me?
###1034 Could you just pronounce him so l can go home?
###1038 <i>I'll never forget that moment,</i>
###1040 <i>The way he looked exactly the same</i>
###1043 <i>only completely different,</i>
###1046 <i>The shame that all I could think about</i> <i>was how hard this was for me,</i>
###1054 Time of death 0200.
###1059 <i>I just wanted to help people,</i>
###1062 <i>The hardest part is how quickly</i> <i>you have to move on,</i>
###1065 Don't worry, you're gonna be fine.
###1070 l lied before. l'm scared every second.
###1073 Really?
###1075 lt's a good thing they make surgical masks. lf they didn't,
###1078 everyone would know my face was like this the whole time.
###1083 l think it's OK to be scared.
###1086 l need you to tell me that.
###1088 <i>He needs me?</i>
###1089 l just came to check up on you, see how you're doing.
###1093 <i>Ask him to move in again,</i>
###1095 Turk, the offer still stands...
###1097 l already took the keys out your bag.
###1101 l love you.
###1107 <i>And like that I got a second wind,</i>
###1113 l'm watching you.
###1122 - How you holding up? - <i>There he is, My safety net,</i>
###1125 l saw that you're still pushing to put Mrs Pratt on the transplant list.
###1130 Bad news, though. She doesn't have the insurance to cover it.
###1134 But she's a second away from total renal failure.
###1137 OK...
###1139 Did you ask the Burski family for permission to do an autopsy?
###1143 They're still with him.
###1145 lt's a teaching hospital, you gotta ask.
###1148 <i>Tell him you can't see</i> <i>Mr Burski again he'll understand,</i>
###1151 Sir, do you think l could skip just this one?
###1154 Why, sure, sport.
###1156 <i>See? Every story needs a good guy,</i>
###1159 ln fact, why don't you just head on home?
###1163 You look kinda tired.
###1165 l am pretty tired.
###1168 Dr Dorian, do you not realise
###1171 that you're nothing but a large pair of scrubs to me?
###1175 The only reason l carry this chart around
###1178 is so l can pretend to remember your names.
###1180 lf the patient has insurance, you treat them.
###1183 lf they don't, you show them the door.
###1186 And if somebody dies, you get the autopsy.
###1189 Get it by rounds tomorrow or l'll scratch your name off my chart. Clear?
###1193 Answer me!
###1195 Crystal clear.
###1197 Great, sport.
###1202 <i>If he's the jerk,,,</i>
###1205 <i>,,,then who's the good guy?</i>
###1208 Car accident. Crashed on the way up.
###1210 Relieve the pressure on his chest. JD, do it.
###1213 <i>God no,</i>
###1214 Look at me. You can do this.
###1216 - <i>And I believed him,</i> - Chest tube tray.
###1219 <i>You know kind of,</i>
###1221 Come on, baby, let's go.
###1223 <i>You can do this,</i> <i>You have to do this,</i>
###1226 JD, cut him or lose him.
###1228 Give me the tube.
###1234 l can't get through the pleura.
###1235 Don't be gentle, get it in there.
###1238 Connect it, please, Carla.
###1244 - Normal rhythm. - No way!
###1246 lt's a piece of cake. lt's your patient.
###1249 You're leaving?
###1252 That's your patient, doctor.
###1259 Good.
###1260 - That's enough. - Sorry.
###1262 lt's a very big moment for me.
###1264 <i>I guess that's it for now,</i> <i>3 1 hours 1 2 minutes and I am,,,</i>
###1269 You finally off?
###1270 Almost. l have one more annoying thing l gotta do.
###1273 lf it's the Burski autopsy, l called the family
###1276 and they said fine, and to thank you, and l'm sorry.
###1279 They didn't say that last part, l did.
###1281 <i>The worst part was knowing</i> <i>I could never forgive her,</i>
###1286 <i>I forgive her,</i>
###1288 <i>You see I can't survive on my own,</i>
###1290 l'm a dork. A dork. l'm a dork.
###1293 <i>Even now</i> <i>when I get to go home</i>
###1295 <i>I'll know the hospital's still here</i> <i>wide awake,</i>
###1298 Get out while you still can.
###1301 <i>But what the hell,</i>
###1303 <i>The important thing is</i> <i>I got through my first three days</i>
###1306 <i>without looking</i> <i>like a complete idiot,</i>
###1312 <i>I'm the man,</i>
