1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,16



2
0:0:0,16 --> 0:0:1,11
Eggs.


3
0:0:1,11 --> 0:0:2,55
Lots of raw eggs.


4
0:0:2,55 --> 0:0:3,62
Now there's a lot
of cool science


5
0:0:3,62 --> 0:0:4,68
experiments to do with eggs.


6
0:0:4,68 --> 0:0:7,8
But today, we're talking about
the strength of an egg.


7
0:0:7,8 --> 0:0:8,29
Believe it or not, right
out of the shoot, you


8
0:0:8,29 --> 0:0:8,99
can try this at home.


9
0:0:8,99 --> 0:0:11,8
You just take a raw egg, put it
in your hand and squeeze as


10
0:0:11,8 --> 0:0:14,56
hard as you want, and
no matter how--


11
0:0:14,56 --> 0:0:15,78
Oh.


12
0:0:15,78 --> 0:0:18,857
I'm Steve Spangler and I'm all
about making science fun.


13
0:0:18,857 --> 0:0:21,62
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


14
0:0:21,62 --> 0:0:24,31
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


15
0:0:24,31 --> 0:0:25,67
experiences.


16
0:0:25,67 --> 0:0:28,26
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


17
0:0:28,26 --> 0:0:31,0
affect the way people
think about science.


18
0:0:31,0 --> 0:0:33,34
And to do that I live
by one motto.


19
0:0:33,34 --> 0:0:36,305
Make it big, do it right,
give it class.


20
0:0:36,305 --> 0:0:41,73



21
0:0:41,73 --> 0:0:43,93
Well, let me start by
apologizing for my


22
0:0:43,93 --> 0:0:45,95
inappropriate conduct.


23
0:0:45,95 --> 0:0:48,27
I'll be better.


24
0:0:48,27 --> 0:0:51,93
The deal here is this, I didn't
do the thing right,


25
0:0:51,93 --> 0:0:53,74
because if you take an egg,
normally, and you put it in


26
0:0:53,74 --> 0:0:55,57
your hand and squeeze, there's
no problem at all.


27
0:0:55,57 --> 0:0:58,51
But this hand would be fine,
this hand is not.


28
0:0:58,51 --> 0:0:59,45
Why?


29
0:0:59,45 --> 0:1:0,53
Because of the ring.


30
0:1:0,53 --> 0:1:3,62
See the ring put pressure at a
certain point and it broke.


31
0:1:3,62 --> 0:1:6,37
Which brings me to thinking this
is pretty cool, if you


32
0:1:6,37 --> 0:1:8,495
make somebody with a ring
squeeze it in their hands, it


33
0:1:8,495 --> 0:1:9,26
will crack on them.


34
0:1:9,26 --> 0:1:11,6
And somebody without the ring,
it won't crack at all.


35
0:1:11,6 --> 0:1:14,45
It all has to boil down to
the shape of the egg.


36
0:1:14,45 --> 0:1:15,5
And isn't nature amazing?


37
0:1:15,5 --> 0:1:18,4
How it knows how to make
this dome shape.


38
0:1:18,4 --> 0:1:20,9
When you look at it like this,
if this doesn't look like a


39
0:1:20,9 --> 0:1:22,47
little piece of architecture,
I don't know what does, with


40
0:1:22,47 --> 0:1:23,86
that archway.


41
0:1:23,86 --> 0:1:26,31
And you look at how it
distributes the weight on


42
0:1:26,31 --> 0:1:27,78
either side, perfectly.


43
0:1:27,78 --> 0:1:30,81
We simply emulate nature in
architecture and it works.


44
0:1:30,81 --> 0:1:33,21
So a long way of saying,
put it your hand


45
0:1:33,21 --> 0:1:34,345
like this and squeeze.


46
0:1:34,345 --> 0:1:37,2
And if you squeeze as hard as
you can, honestly, as hard as


47
0:1:37,2 --> 0:1:39,12
you can, you can't
break the egg.


48
0:1:39,12 --> 0:1:41,55
Because all of that pressure
is being disseminated, or


49
0:1:41,55 --> 0:1:44,13
dispersed, all over
that shell.


50
0:1:44,13 --> 0:1:46,64
Now there are times where I've
done it this way, and tried to


51
0:1:46,64 --> 0:1:47,46
crack it like this.


52
0:1:47,46 --> 0:1:49,63
And sometimes it's a
little easier, even


53
0:1:49,63 --> 0:1:50,61
this one's not bad.


54
0:1:50,61 --> 0:1:54,6
But as soon as the ring goes on
like this and you squeeze,


55
0:1:54,6 --> 0:1:57,79
that causes a small little
fracture and the egg breaks.


56
0:1:57,79 --> 0:1:59,39
And now you know the secret.


57
0:1:59,39 --> 0:2:0,776
But there's other cool
things about an egg


58
0:2:0,776 --> 0:2:1,291
that you need to know.


59
0:2:1,291 --> 0:2:2,93
And it's what the egg
is made out of.


60
0:2:2,93 --> 0:2:5,49
This shell, on the outside, is
made out of a substance called


61
0:2:5,49 --> 0:2:6,92
calcium carbonate.


62
0:2:6,92 --> 0:2:9,83
And, believe it or not, that
substance is easily dissolved


63
0:2:9,83 --> 0:2:12,24
using a simple acid
like vinegar.


64
0:2:12,24 --> 0:2:14,58
Well it's a classic elementary
science experiment.


65
0:2:14,58 --> 0:2:17,33
You take a raw egg and you put
it in a container like this.


66
0:2:17,33 --> 0:2:20,78
And then you pour the vinegar
over the top.


67
0:2:20,78 --> 0:2:23,2
Now, if you're in a chemistry
class you might use something


68
0:2:23,2 --> 0:2:24,86
like hydrochloric acid.


69
0:2:24,86 --> 0:2:27,27
At home this vinegar
is perfectly fine.


70
0:2:27,27 --> 0:2:29,76
There are two strengths of
vinegar, so sometimes at the


71
0:2:29,76 --> 0:2:32,31
grocery store you can get
concentrated vinegar and that


72
0:2:32,31 --> 0:2:33,68
will speed this whole
process up.


73
0:2:33,68 --> 0:2:36,24
But even right now, take a look,
you can start to see the


74
0:2:36,24 --> 0:2:38,96
bubbles forming on the
outside of the egg.


75
0:2:38,96 --> 0:2:41,74
And those bubbles are
carbon dioxide.


76
0:2:41,74 --> 0:2:44,92
So, over time, you're going to
eat away at that calcium


77
0:2:44,92 --> 0:2:49,8
carbonate and you're going
to get a naked egg.


78
0:2:49,8 --> 0:2:51,37
Well, it's going to be naked.


79
0:2:51,37 --> 0:2:54,22
But it's going to be naked
in about a week or so.


80
0:2:54,22 --> 0:2:56,26
And you don't have time to watch
it, even with time lapse


81
0:2:56,26 --> 0:2:57,51
you'd be bored.


82
0:2:57,51 --> 0:2:59,63
So I took the liberty
of making one just a


83
0:2:59,63 --> 0:3:1,65
little while ago.


84
0:3:1,65 --> 0:3:3,6
Take a look at this.


85
0:3:3,6 --> 0:3:5,41
This is a naked egg.


86
0:3:5,41 --> 0:3:7,94
Now it doesn't seem like it,
because we let this one sit a


87
0:3:7,94 --> 0:3:8,63
little bit longer.


88
0:3:8,63 --> 0:3:10,96
But look, it is.


89
0:3:10,96 --> 0:3:14,625
All of that outside shell
has been removed.


90
0:3:14,625 --> 0:3:15,89
And here it is.


91
0:3:15,89 --> 0:3:18,57
But maybe the best way to be
able to see it is to use a


92
0:3:18,57 --> 0:3:20,8
light like this.


93
0:3:20,8 --> 0:3:23,22
You can actually see some of
the shell, right here.


94
0:3:23,22 --> 0:3:25,8
So you see this little
part of the shell?


95
0:3:25,8 --> 0:3:28,47
But I found that it is even
cooler if you take an egg and


96
0:3:28,47 --> 0:3:32,9
you only dip it partially
in the vinegar.


97
0:3:32,9 --> 0:3:34,7
And this is what you get when
you pull it out just


98
0:3:34,7 --> 0:3:35,83
a little bit early.


99
0:3:35,83 --> 0:3:38,6
This is the naked egg, but you
see can see the shell is here


100
0:3:38,6 --> 0:3:40,45
on this side, and
it's completely


101
0:3:40,45 --> 0:3:41,88
eaten away right here.


102
0:3:41,88 --> 0:3:45,32
So when you take a look at
it, take a look at this.


103
0:3:45,32 --> 0:3:49,66
You can actually see the pits
where the vinegar started to


104
0:3:49,66 --> 0:3:50,84
eat into like this.


105
0:3:50,84 --> 0:3:52,84
It's a partially naked egg.


106
0:3:52,84 --> 0:3:56,21
Well now that you know that an
egg is strong, we need to find


107
0:3:56,21 --> 0:3:57,47
out just how strong it is.


108
0:3:57,47 --> 0:3:58,56
So it's time for a test.


109
0:3:58,56 --> 0:4:0,59
And the little set up that
we have here is perfect.


110
0:4:0,59 --> 0:4:2,29
We happen to have
a digital scale.


111
0:4:2,29 --> 0:4:3,33
That's what this is here.


112
0:4:3,33 --> 0:4:5,56
And I got the digital scale
from the same people I was


113
0:4:5,56 --> 0:4:7,62
babysitting the dog from, that
we used the speakers, you


114
0:4:7,62 --> 0:4:8,46
know, for the cornstarch
monsters.


115
0:4:8,46 --> 0:4:9,79
Who would have thought--


116
0:4:9,79 --> 0:4:10,49
[BANG, BANG]


117
0:4:10,49 --> 0:4:11,31
--they got a scale.


118
0:4:11,31 --> 0:4:12,38
So we have a scale.


119
0:4:12,38 --> 0:4:15,16
And on top of that scale we're
going to use the egg crate.


120
0:4:15,16 --> 0:4:16,68
So this will be a perfect
way to be able to


121
0:4:16,68 --> 0:4:17,89
hold it, like that.


122
0:4:17,89 --> 0:4:20,23
And now, we're going
to take a raw egg.


123
0:4:20,23 --> 0:4:23,32
And our raw egg's going
to go right here.


124
0:4:23,32 --> 0:4:24,67
And then we're going to put
some pressure on it.


125
0:4:24,67 --> 0:4:25,82
Well, we'll tare it out.


126
0:4:25,82 --> 0:4:27,305
Here, let me tear it out.


127
0:4:27,305 --> 0:4:29,42
All right, it's at zero.


128
0:4:29,42 --> 0:4:30,11
Perfect.


129
0:4:30,11 --> 0:4:31,64
All right, we're going
to take the tray.


130
0:4:31,64 --> 0:4:34,93
The tray goes on
top like this.


131
0:4:34,93 --> 0:4:37,65
And now we're going to put some
pressure on just a single


132
0:4:37,65 --> 0:4:39,3
egg to see how much
pressure I can put


133
0:4:39,3 --> 0:4:41,18
until it finally breaks.


134
0:4:41,18 --> 0:4:42,43
Watch.


135
0:4:42,43 --> 0:4:46,12



136
0:4:46,12 --> 0:4:47,53
Ugh.


137
0:4:47,53 --> 0:4:49,21
13 pounds, somewhere
around there.


138
0:4:49,21 --> 0:4:50,675
It's not very good.


139
0:4:50,675 --> 0:4:52,25
And see where that pressure
point is?


140
0:4:52,25 --> 0:4:54,8
And it kind of makes sense,
because when this was here,


141
0:4:54,8 --> 0:4:55,44
look at this.


142
0:4:55,44 --> 0:4:57,88
When it was on top, you can see
where that pressure point,


143
0:4:57,88 --> 0:5:0,39
all the pressure was on the
very, very top, there.


144
0:5:0,39 --> 0:5:1,496
So it's no wonder it broke.


145
0:5:1,496 --> 0:5:3,58
It's just like my ring being
able to push into it.


146
0:5:3,58 --> 0:5:5,67
So I think we need more eggs.


147
0:5:5,67 --> 0:5:8,9
So let's go from one
to four eggs.


148
0:5:8,9 --> 0:5:10,99
So if we can support all four
corners sitting over here,


149
0:5:10,99 --> 0:5:13,16
let's see what that
would do for us.


150
0:5:13,16 --> 0:5:14,1
One here.


151
0:5:14,1 --> 0:5:17,74
Here's let's do all four
corners, like this.


152
0:5:17,74 --> 0:5:19,61
So, hopefully, we'll distribute
the weight.


153
0:5:19,61 --> 0:5:24,2
And, hopefully, they're kind
of the same height.


154
0:5:24,2 --> 0:5:25,59
It's pretty close.


155
0:5:25,59 --> 0:5:27,34
Looks like they're all about
the same height.


156
0:5:27,34 --> 0:5:30,9
I'll try to keep the pressure
equal here in the very center.


157
0:5:30,9 --> 0:5:32,388
All right, here we go.


158
0:5:32,388 --> 0:5:35,44
Here we go.


159
0:5:35,44 --> 0:5:37,87
This is good.


160
0:5:37,87 --> 0:5:39,32
[CLUNK]


161
0:5:39,32 --> 0:5:40,92
Shot the back and everything.


162
0:5:40,92 --> 0:5:43,616
It's disgusting back here.


163
0:5:43,616 --> 0:5:44,53
There you go.


164
0:5:44,53 --> 0:5:45,45
Look at this.


165
0:5:45,45 --> 0:5:46,72
Three eggs break.


166
0:5:46,72 --> 0:5:47,39
One's fine.


167
0:5:47,39 --> 0:5:49,4
Just means that the pressure
wasn't the same.


168
0:5:49,4 --> 0:5:51,38
And I probably didn't make
sure everything is equal.


169
0:5:51,38 --> 0:5:54,18
I think what's going to be best
is if I put one here in


170
0:5:54,18 --> 0:5:55,92
the middle and another
one here.


171
0:5:55,92 --> 0:5:59,15
Six eggs, which looks
pretty good.


172
0:5:59,15 --> 0:6:0,44
Tray on top.


173
0:6:0,44 --> 0:6:2,115
Now we just have
to have weight.


174
0:6:2,115 --> 0:6:6,24
I could get people here
at the Spangler


175
0:6:6,24 --> 0:6:8,32
Playground to sit on it.


176
0:6:8,32 --> 0:6:9,38
I don't think they're
going to do that.


177
0:6:9,38 --> 0:6:11,57
I think it's probably a better
idea to get some


178
0:6:11,57 --> 0:6:14,93
books, lots of books.


179
0:6:14,93 --> 0:6:16,25
Books.


180
0:6:16,25 --> 0:6:17,184
Some of my favorite
ones right here.


181
0:6:17,184 --> 0:6:19,53
Look at this one here, I love
this one. "Science Circus."


182
0:6:19,53 --> 0:6:21,21
That's a good one.
"Thanksgiving


183
0:6:21,21 --> 0:6:22,17
Magic," I love that.


184
0:6:22,17 --> 0:6:24,95
Oh, here's one of my favorite
ones, look at this one here,


185
0:6:24,95 --> 0:6:28,6
"Naked Eggs and Flying
Potatoes." I love this book.


186
0:6:28,6 --> 0:6:31,33
Oh, and here's the sequel, "Fire
Bubbles and Exploding


187
0:6:31,33 --> 0:6:33,51
Toothpaste." Just don't know
if they're still--


188
0:6:33,51 --> 0:6:34,77
oh, they are still available.


189
0:6:34,77 --> 0:6:36,5
Where can you get them?


190
0:6:36,5 --> 0:6:37,3
Stevespanglerscience.com.


191
0:6:37,3 --> 0:6:39,19



192
0:6:39,19 --> 0:6:41,135
That's cool, torque.


193
0:6:41,135 --> 0:6:43,75
Check this out--


194
0:6:43,75 --> 0:6:44,65
oh, sorry.


195
0:6:44,65 --> 0:6:48,21
We've got some books and
we need to have eggs.


196
0:6:48,21 --> 0:6:50,46
So here's what we've got.


197
0:6:50,46 --> 0:6:51,49
Here's this whole piece here.


198
0:6:51,49 --> 0:6:55,44
I think that the idea here
is to get six eggs.


199
0:6:55,44 --> 0:6:57,68
And just inspect them
and make sure


200
0:6:57,68 --> 0:6:59,9
they're good at the beginning.


201
0:6:59,9 --> 0:7:4,2
And let's see if we can get them
all as even as possible.


202
0:7:4,2 --> 0:7:7,34
That looks a little high
but maybe we'll be OK.


203
0:7:7,34 --> 0:7:10,38
We're going to say, just here,
two in the very middle.


204
0:7:10,38 --> 0:7:13,66
Hopefully, try to keep things
as symmetrical as possible.


205
0:7:13,66 --> 0:7:16,37
We can see how even
this really is.


206
0:7:16,37 --> 0:7:21,23
Let's see if we're making
contact all the way around,


207
0:7:21,23 --> 0:7:22,73
bingo, and we are.


208
0:7:22,73 --> 0:7:25,48
And take the tray off, because
we want to tare it to know


209
0:7:25,48 --> 0:7:28,32
exactly how much weight.


210
0:7:28,32 --> 0:7:30,39
Perfect.


211
0:7:30,39 --> 0:7:31,64
All right, tray on top.


212
0:7:31,64 --> 0:7:34,29



213
0:7:34,29 --> 0:7:36,394
Let's start adding some books.


214
0:7:36,394 --> 0:7:38,71
"Chemical Demonstrations,"
it's fitting.


215
0:7:38,71 --> 0:7:40,41
The bible for everybody
who ever did


216
0:7:40,41 --> 0:7:42,54
demonstrations in college.


217
0:7:42,54 --> 0:7:43,83
So that's perfect.


218
0:7:43,83 --> 0:7:45,4
Everything is good.


219
0:7:45,4 --> 0:7:47,2
All right, here we go.


220
0:7:47,2 --> 0:7:52,51
Volume two, volume three.


221
0:7:52,51 --> 0:7:55,51
Even though we're just on the
very tips of the eggs, we're


222
0:7:55,51 --> 0:7:58,5
distributing that weight
over six eggs.


223
0:7:58,5 --> 0:8:0,79
So this one goes here.


224
0:8:0,79 --> 0:8:3,523
And how about a classic.


225
0:8:3,523 --> 0:8:4,35
One right here.


226
0:8:4,35 --> 0:8:6,1
This one's a great one.


227
0:8:6,1 --> 0:8:9,686
And how about these here.


228
0:8:9,686 --> 0:8:10,936
Good.


229
0:8:10,936 --> 0:8:13,182



230
0:8:13,182 --> 0:8:16,38
One of my favorite books,
a really hard to find.


231
0:8:16,38 --> 0:8:19,42
This "Mr. Wizard's Science
Secrets," a great one.


232
0:8:19,42 --> 0:8:21,85
All right, this one goes here.


233
0:8:21,85 --> 0:8:22,77
I hear--


234
0:8:22,77 --> 0:8:24,2
I hear creaking.


235
0:8:24,2 --> 0:8:26,17



236
0:8:26,17 --> 0:8:29,13
[CRUNCH]


237
0:8:29,13 --> 0:8:31,78
Thank goodness these two
books were not the ones


238
0:8:31,78 --> 0:8:33,419
that broke the eggs.


239
0:8:33,419 --> 0:8:35,14
All right, 30 pounds.


240
0:8:35,14 --> 0:8:37,37
But 30 pounds and six
eggs, not so bad.


241
0:8:37,37 --> 0:8:39,51
And we were on the very,
very tops of the eggs.


242
0:8:39,51 --> 0:8:41,21
So if you wanted to turn this
into like a science fair


243
0:8:41,21 --> 0:8:44,12
project, you would just simply
relate the amount of pressure,


244
0:8:44,12 --> 0:8:46,67
or the weight, that you
can put on here, to


245
0:8:46,67 --> 0:8:47,505
the number of eggs.


246
0:8:47,505 --> 0:8:49,16
So instead of just doing
six, maybe you try


247
0:8:49,16 --> 0:8:50,2
eight, or you try ten.


248
0:8:50,2 --> 0:8:52,3
Or whatever it might be.


249
0:8:52,3 --> 0:8:55,4
Let's just use a whole tray of
eggs and see how many books we


250
0:8:55,4 --> 0:8:56,53
can get on top.


251
0:8:56,53 --> 0:9:1,3
30 eggs, here we go.


252
0:9:1,3 --> 0:9:5,33
Careful of the first
ones here, so we


253
0:9:5,33 --> 0:9:6,58
equalize the pressure.


254
0:9:6,58 --> 0:9:13,99



255
0:9:13,99 --> 0:9:16,68
All right, that's it,
all the books.


256
0:9:16,68 --> 0:9:19,21
And you can see--


257
0:9:19,21 --> 0:9:20,69
I'm hearing creaking.


258
0:9:20,69 --> 0:9:23,58
But I think it's the creaking
of the actual container


259
0:9:23,58 --> 0:9:27,27
itself, and not the
breaking of eggs.


260
0:9:27,27 --> 0:9:30,13
We are perfectly fine.


261
0:9:30,13 --> 0:9:32,495
The only way we'll be able to
see, is to take all the books


262
0:9:32,495 --> 0:9:34,34
off and lift the tray.


263
0:9:34,34 --> 0:9:38,34
All right, here's
the truth test.


264
0:9:38,34 --> 0:9:39,87
See, I'm pleasantly surprised.


265
0:9:39,87 --> 0:9:41,49
Look at this.


266
0:9:41,49 --> 0:9:45,11
The creaking that I heard was
the sound of this egg carton,


267
0:9:45,11 --> 0:9:47,87
itself, moving, but if you look
at these eggs, we are


268
0:9:47,87 --> 0:9:48,78
perfectly fine.


269
0:9:48,78 --> 0:9:52,92
We got to 59 pounds, total
of 30 eggs, no cracks.


270
0:9:52,92 --> 0:9:55,94
We need more weight because we
want to see what it takes to


271
0:9:55,94 --> 0:9:57,69
be able to break this.


272
0:9:57,69 --> 0:9:58,635
You know what we need?


273
0:9:58,635 --> 0:9:59,85
Not more books.


274
0:9:59,85 --> 0:10:0,91
We don't need bricks.


275
0:10:0,91 --> 0:10:4,43
We need people.


276
0:10:4,43 --> 0:10:6,835
Higginsworth, come here.


277
0:10:6,835 --> 0:10:7,79
No, it will be fun.


278
0:10:7,79 --> 0:10:9,26
Come here.


279
0:10:9,26 --> 0:10:13,36
356, 57, 58, 59, 60.


280
0:10:13,36 --> 0:10:15,43
360 eggs.


281
0:10:15,43 --> 0:10:18,17
Sure, I could have done some
quick multiplication, but why


282
0:10:18,17 --> 0:10:19,36
when you can count?


283
0:10:19,36 --> 0:10:21,26
Because counting is fun.


284
0:10:21,26 --> 0:10:21,84
Here's the deal.


285
0:10:21,84 --> 0:10:23,98
This is the ultimate
egg stunt.


286
0:10:23,98 --> 0:10:26,58
We saw how strong they are, now
we want to see if we can


287
0:10:26,58 --> 0:10:28,574
walk them, because these little
eggs are saying, (IN A


288
0:10:28,574 --> 0:10:29,85
SQUEAKY VOICE) please
walk on me.


289
0:10:29,85 --> 0:10:32,7
Please whatever you
do, walk on me.


290
0:10:32,7 --> 0:10:34,35
And we want to fulfill
their every desire.


291
0:10:34,35 --> 0:10:36,42
So we're going to
walk on them.


292
0:10:36,42 --> 0:10:37,135
But not me.


293
0:10:37,135 --> 0:10:37,88
No, no.


294
0:10:37,88 --> 0:10:40,34
We're going to find something
that you know and you love, my


295
0:10:40,34 --> 0:10:42,56
best friend, Higginsworth.


296
0:10:42,56 --> 0:10:44,1
Come here, Higginsworth.


297
0:10:44,1 --> 0:10:45,9
All right, this is going
to be great.


298
0:10:45,9 --> 0:10:46,425
Sounds good.


299
0:10:46,425 --> 0:10:47,41
Get off the phone.


300
0:10:47,41 --> 0:10:49,75
No, I'm available to
start any time.


301
0:10:49,75 --> 0:10:51,54
He can't start anytime.


302
0:10:51,54 --> 0:10:52,7
I got to go.


303
0:10:52,7 --> 0:10:53,15
Sorry.


304
0:10:53,15 --> 0:10:53,9
So what are we doing?


305
0:10:53,9 --> 0:10:54,69
OK, look.


306
0:10:54,69 --> 0:10:55,72
You're going to walk on eggs.


307
0:10:55,72 --> 0:10:56,53
OK?


308
0:10:56,53 --> 0:10:58,29
So I need you to those
shoes off.


309
0:10:58,29 --> 0:11:0,2
And we are going to
walk on eggs.


310
0:11:0,2 --> 0:11:0,83
Go.


311
0:11:0,83 --> 0:11:1,49
Get them off.


312
0:11:1,49 --> 0:11:1,83
All right.


313
0:11:1,83 --> 0:11:3,91
Let's do it.


314
0:11:3,91 --> 0:11:5,16
Whoa.


315
0:11:5,16 --> 0:11:7,16



316
0:11:7,16 --> 0:11:9,99
Where did you get
feet like that?


317
0:11:9,99 --> 0:11:10,74
Let's not worry about that.


318
0:11:10,74 --> 0:11:12,95
What are we doing here?


319
0:11:12,95 --> 0:11:15,14
Listen, I think you need
to get them wrapped up.


320
0:11:15,14 --> 0:11:16,19
So get some bubble wrap.


321
0:11:16,19 --> 0:11:18,2
I want a nice cushion as you're
going through here.


322
0:11:18,2 --> 0:11:19,25
I don't want these
eggs, breaking.


323
0:11:19,25 --> 0:11:19,708
OK.


324
0:11:19,708 --> 0:11:20,958
Bubble wrap.


325
0:11:20,958 --> 0:11:22,914



326
0:11:22,914 --> 0:11:23,38
OK.


327
0:11:23,38 --> 0:11:24,19
Perfect.


328
0:11:24,19 --> 0:11:26,67
Here's the deal, if you make all
the way across, no broken


329
0:11:26,67 --> 0:11:29,53
eggs, you're going to get, in
addition to your $20 this


330
0:11:29,53 --> 0:11:31,285
week, an extra $5.


331
0:11:31,285 --> 0:11:33,7
You're going to find a five.


332
0:11:33,7 --> 0:11:33,86
That is impressive.


333
0:11:33,86 --> 0:11:34,5
OK.


334
0:11:34,5 --> 0:11:34,76
Here we go.


335
0:11:34,76 --> 0:11:35,99
Go.


336
0:11:35,99 --> 0:11:40,73
Nice, I'm helping you,
good job, yes.


337
0:11:40,73 --> 0:11:42,0
This is good.


338
0:11:42,0 --> 0:11:43,4
Perfect.


339
0:11:43,4 --> 0:11:44,34
Perfect.


340
0:11:44,34 --> 0:11:45,6
And it's there.


341
0:11:45,6 --> 0:11:47,99
And look back and see what
a great job you--


342
0:11:47,99 --> 0:11:49,32
son of a [BLIP]


343
0:11:49,32 --> 0:11:50,69
It's the bubble wrap.


344
0:11:50,69 --> 0:11:53,3
Why did you move forward with
the bubble wrap idea?


345
0:11:53,3 --> 0:11:53,87
Bad idea.


346
0:11:53,87 --> 0:11:56,54
I should have had your
actual feet on there.


347
0:11:56,54 --> 0:11:59,95
Can you get the bubble
wrap off, please?


348
0:11:59,95 --> 0:12:1,64
Wow, I can get over
those feet.


349
0:12:1,64 --> 0:12:2,91
Yikes.


350
0:12:2,91 --> 0:12:6,8
All right, this time,
no bubble wrap.


351
0:12:6,8 --> 0:12:7,34
So we replaced all the eggs.


352
0:12:7,34 --> 0:12:9,64
This time, no bubble
wrap, bare feet.


353
0:12:9,64 --> 0:12:11,61
I think it's going to be better
because the feet will


354
0:12:11,61 --> 0:12:12,88
contour to the eggs.


355
0:12:12,88 --> 0:12:15,952
I think it's going to be good.


356
0:12:15,952 --> 0:12:18,78
OK, so here we go.


357
0:12:18,78 --> 0:12:21,22
There you go, good.


358
0:12:21,22 --> 0:12:21,51
Good.


359
0:12:21,51 --> 0:12:23,6
It's OK, keep going, let's go.


360
0:12:23,6 --> 0:12:23,69
There you go.


361
0:12:23,69 --> 0:12:24,79
Go, ready?


362
0:12:24,79 --> 0:12:31,97
And, good, good, good, keep
going, and go, go.


363
0:12:31,97 --> 0:12:34,15
And go, go.


364
0:12:34,15 --> 0:12:36,93
Go go, good.


365
0:12:36,93 --> 0:12:39,5
Go, go.


366
0:12:39,5 --> 0:12:43,63
All right, all right, do you
think we can fix that in post?


367
0:12:43,63 --> 0:12:46,72
Well here's what we just
learned, as big and cool as


368
0:12:46,72 --> 0:12:49,38
these trays are with a total
of 30 eggs, they


369
0:12:49,38 --> 0:12:51,7
don't work at all.


370
0:12:51,7 --> 0:12:52,79
They just don't support
the eggs.


371
0:12:52,79 --> 0:12:54,26
And we had a couple
that cracked.


372
0:12:54,26 --> 0:12:56,51
And then these became
very flimsy.


373
0:12:56,51 --> 0:12:58,81
So if you're trying to impress
your friends, don't be using


374
0:12:58,81 --> 0:13:0,35
these big huge crates.


375
0:13:0,35 --> 0:13:3,22
By accident, we looked at
these smaller cartons.


376
0:13:3,22 --> 0:13:6,3
Look at this, the smaller carton
has a lot more support


377
0:13:6,3 --> 0:13:7,11
for those eggs.


378
0:13:7,11 --> 0:13:9,2
And so we're going to stagger
them like this.


379
0:13:9,2 --> 0:13:12,17
And we think, or at least the
theory is, that this is going


380
0:13:12,17 --> 0:13:14,69
to support the feet
much better.


381
0:13:14,69 --> 0:13:17,1
All right, Higginsworth,
here we go.


382
0:13:17,1 --> 0:13:18,465
OK, left foot on first.


383
0:13:18,465 --> 0:13:20,14
Let's see.


384
0:13:20,14 --> 0:13:20,89
That's it.


385
0:13:20,89 --> 0:13:21,45
That's it.


386
0:13:21,45 --> 0:13:22,65
Good.


387
0:13:22,65 --> 0:13:23,91
Good.


388
0:13:23,91 --> 0:13:26,27
Good, walk through, you're
doing great.


389
0:13:26,27 --> 0:13:27,55
I hear it.


390
0:13:27,55 --> 0:13:28,56
You're doing great.


391
0:13:28,56 --> 0:13:29,675
10 cartons total.


392
0:13:29,675 --> 0:13:31,66
Look at this, 10
cartons, total.


393
0:13:31,66 --> 0:13:32,0
You ready?


394
0:13:32,0 --> 0:13:32,66
Here.


395
0:13:32,66 --> 0:13:33,34
Nice.


396
0:13:33,34 --> 0:13:33,89
Look at that.


397
0:13:33,89 --> 0:13:35,375
All right, there's creaking
but come here and


398
0:13:35,375 --> 0:13:35,98
take a look at this.


399
0:13:35,98 --> 0:13:38,52
We have a couple little
minor cracks, but


400
0:13:38,52 --> 0:13:39,83
nothing that's horrible.


401
0:13:39,83 --> 0:13:41,35
Nice job, Higgins--


402
0:13:41,35 --> 0:13:42,37
You did it.


403
0:13:42,37 --> 0:13:42,91
It's the egg walk.


404
0:13:42,91 --> 0:13:43,58
Thanks, Steve.


405
0:13:43,58 --> 0:13:45,85
All right, you're going to
enjoy your egg walk.


406
0:13:45,85 --> 0:13:46,72
This is going to be great.


407
0:13:46,72 --> 0:13:49,79
And, Higs, the greatest
thing here is, watch.


408
0:13:49,79 --> 0:13:51,915
These are not broken, so--


409
0:13:51,915 --> 0:13:52,95
What am I doing with these?


410
0:13:52,95 --> 0:13:53,99
You can return them.


411
0:13:53,99 --> 0:13:54,27
All right?


412
0:13:54,27 --> 0:13:55,33
To the store?


413
0:13:55,33 --> 0:13:56,16
Get them back fast.


414
0:13:56,16 --> 0:13:56,96
All right.


415
0:13:56,96 --> 0:13:58,75
So, that will be absolutely
perfect.


416
0:13:58,75 --> 0:14:1,18
Or, why don't you make your
mom a nice omelet.


417
0:14:1,18 --> 0:14:3,375
You know how you're pretty
good at making omelets?


418
0:14:3,375 --> 0:14:5,23
All right, so just make
her an omelet.


419
0:14:5,23 --> 0:14:5,84
OK.


420
0:14:5,84 --> 0:14:6,59
This will be great.


421
0:14:6,59 --> 0:14:8,43
How about tomorrow morning
you bring us all some


422
0:14:8,43 --> 0:14:9,58
omelets, all right?


423
0:14:9,58 --> 0:14:10,42
That'll be great.


424
0:14:10,42 --> 0:14:12,58
And just tell her, that
we just used these


425
0:14:12,58 --> 0:14:13,475
a little tiny bit.


426
0:14:13,475 --> 0:14:14,33
So, it's fine.


427
0:14:14,33 --> 0:14:15,93
But I don't want to
waste those eggs.


428
0:14:15,93 --> 0:14:16,65
OK?


429
0:14:16,65 --> 0:14:17,38
Got it?


430
0:14:17,38 --> 0:14:17,97
OK.


431
0:14:17,97 --> 0:14:18,72
Here you go.


432
0:14:18,72 --> 0:14:19,45
Put those in your car.


433
0:14:19,45 --> 0:14:21,442
Taking these back.


434
0:14:21,442 --> 0:14:23,932
[PLOP]


435
0:14:23,932 --> 0:14:25,426
[SIGH]


436
0:14:25,426 --> 0:14:52,32
[MUSIC PLAYING]


437
0:14:52,32 --> 0:14:53,57
Damn solar cooker.
