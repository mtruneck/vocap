Welcome to DoDEA News in a Minute.


3
0:0:9,837 --> 0:0:13,214
Since it's beginning in 1989, millions of students in grades 4th through 8th 


4
0:0:13,214 --> 0:0:15,591
have competed each year for a twenty-five thousand dollar college scholarship, 


5
0:0:15,591 --> 0:0:18,882
and the honor of being crowned the National Geographic Bee Champion. 


6
0:0:18,882 --> 0:0:22,278
Winners of the state-level competitions met in Washington late last month.  


7
0:0:22,278 --> 0:0:25,387
Representing DoDEA this year was Gavin Moulton, a 7th Grade student from 


8
0:0:25,387 --> 0:0:28,861
Naples American Middle School in Naples, Italy.


9
0:0:28,861 --> 0:0:32,675
While in the Nation's Capitol, the Moulton family toured DoDEA Headquarters, 


10
0:0:32,675 --> 0:0:35,183
and met with Deputy Director Charlie Toth.


11
0:0:35,183 --> 0:0:37,325
Moulton, who placed a respectable 16th in this year's event, 


12
0:0:37,325 --> 0:0:39,31
had one piece of advice for future competitors.


13
0:0:39,31 --> 0:0:43,542
"Study, study, study.  If you want to do well, you have to study.  


14
0:0:43,542 --> 0:0:49,54
Many kids there spend a lot of their time and they're very, very, very smart.   


15
0:0:49,54 --> 0:0:52,215
I mean if you watched any of the DVD's they had of the finals, 


16
0:0:52,215 --> 0:0:54,722
you can tell that all the kids are very, very smart."


17
0:0:54,722 --> 0:0:57,648
National Geographic Channel will air the BEE competition over 


18
0:0:57,648 --> 0:0:59,904
four nights beginning Monday, June 13th.


19
0:0:59,904 --> 0:1:2,846
That's all for this edition of DoDEA News in a Minute, thanks for watching.
