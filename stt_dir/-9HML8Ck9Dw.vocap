###0 STEVE: You know, in the summer time, there's nothing I like
###3 more than just going camping.
###5 Being in the complete wilderness, completely alone,
###8 and camping with my trusty tent right here.
###11 You know what I like to do when we're camping?
###12 I also like to make s'mores.
###14 The problem with this is that in Colorado we have a lot of
###17 forest fires, and so because of those forest--
###21 Because of those forest fires, I've got to come up with a new
###23 way to be able to roast marshmallows.
###25 And I think I've got a great idea using just the
###28 power of the sun.
###31 I'm Steve Spangler and I'm all about making science fun.
###34 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###37 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###40 experiences.
###41 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###44 affect the way people think about science.
###46 And to do that I live by one motto.
###49 Make it big, do it right, give it class.
###52 
###57 Well, before we can harness the power of the sun to be
###60 able to cook our s'mores, we need to learn something about
###62 the science of this solar radiation that's
###65 coming to the Earth.
###66 See the sun up there?
###68 It's this giant enormous ball of gas that goes through this
###71 fusion reaction where there's four hydrogen atoms that get
###75 fused together to make one helium atom and this--
###78 That's not really important.
###78 What's important is all this radiation is coming down and
###81 the Earth's atmosphere, just the air and the ozone layer,
###84 block 97% to 95% of this radiation that comes through.
###88 But the stuff that does get through can still be
###90 dangerous, and that's why you need something like this UV
###93 checker to tell you whether or not you need to have sunscreen
###96 and how much you need to have.
###97 So you just push the little button here on this solar
###99 index meter and it reads the amount of UVA, which are the
###102 longest waves all the way to UVC, which are the shortest
###105 waves, to be able to determine how much sunscreen you need.
###108 Bottom line, you've got to have sun protection.
###111 So let's just say you don't have one of these fancy little
###113 UV detectors, is there another way to be able to see the
###115 radiation that's coming through the sky?
###117 Come to find out, there is.
###119 They're these fancy little beads called UV
###121 color changing beads.
###124 You see, these beads start perfectly white when they're
###126 not in ultraviolet light.
###127 But as soon as they're exposed to ultraviolet light, you can
###130 see what happens here.
###130 Watch.
###132 See the white goes to this beautiful color.
###134 And there's actually a pigment in each one of these that the
###137 ultraviolet light causes the bond inside to be able to
###141 dance and twist and you get these
###142 beautiful colors like this.
###143 You can see, just like glass, this plastic here, on the
###146 outside of this pail, allows the ultraviolet light to be
###149 able to come through enough to be able to
###150 make them change color.
###151 But if you dig down inside, where we haven't seen any at
###153 all, take a look at this.
###154 You can see they actually are white on the top until the
###157 moment they reach the ultraviolet light.
###159 
###162 Now, the really cool thing about these color changing
###164 beads is that when they're out of the sun's light, and they
###166 have no UV radiation, the little pigment bonds twist
###170 back to their original shape and they go back to their
###173 colorless state, which is very, very cool.
###175 Watch this.
###176 
###184 While these UV color changing beads are really fun to play
###186 with, they actually are a very, very cool tool to be
###188 able to use for a science fair project to be able to test the
###191 effectiveness of sunscreen.
###193 So, here's how it works.
###195 You take a bag and you put the beads in the bag like this.
###198 Now, they're going to change color immediately because this
###201 plastic here isn't blocking any of the sun's radiation.
###204 Now, you take your sunscreen and you put your sunscreen on
###206 the bag like this and you just rub it all around the bag.
###211 And you kind of smooth it in.
###212 It's not going to absorb, but you just try to cover it.
###215 And then you can see how the intensity
###217 changes with the beads.
###219 So that's why this makes it such a cool science fair
###221 project is you're really comparing the effectiveness of
###224 these sunscreens using a control and some very visual
###227 ways to be able to see how they change color.
###229 Watch this.
###230 This bag here has no sunscreen on it whatsoever.
###233 So it's our control bag.
###234 It's just the ultraviolet light coming through.
###236 You can see, we get these beautiful
###237 colors as we had before.
###239 The second bag here has SPF 30 on there.
###241 So now we have some blocking.
###242 But take a look at this.
###243 It's not nearly as intense as it used to be.
###246 While the blues are still coming through and some
###248 purples, those yellows are almost completely white, which
###250 just goes to show you that there's a different amount of
###253 energy needed to change all the beads a different color.
###255 Move over to SPF 50.
###257 That's very, very cool because now we really see some white
###260 beads in here.
###260 Blues are still coming through but that's cool.
###262 And as soon as you move to 70, this is the coolest part,
###265 because you really see how faint and how well the SPF 70
###269 does to be able to block the harmful rays of the sun.
###273 The very end, you turn them all back over again.
###275 So now, there's no sunscreen showing and they should all
###278 look like the control that you started
###280 with at the very beginning.
###283 That's cool.
###285 Well, now that we know the science behind the sun and
###287 kind of what we need to do to cook our s'mores, we've got to
###289 find a device to be able to do that.
###291 For that, we've got to head back to the kitchen.
###293 The microwave oven, what an amazing invention.
###295 Just a couple seconds, your dinner is ready.
###297 I remember when we got our first one in the 1970s, every
###300 time Dad cooked a little burrito, I'd forget my name
###302 and make animal sounds.
###303 But that's not important, what is important is this.
###305 It uses microwave energy.
###307 Now this is a wavelength of energy that can either be as
###309 big as a meter, maybe as small as a millimeter, that have
###312 different energies and different frequencies between
###315 300 m zzzzs and--
###318 m zzzs?
###320 HIGGINSWORTH: It's megahertz.
###321 STEVE: I told you to do it phonetically, Higginsworth.
###323 HIGGINSWORTH: Sorry, Steve.
###325 STEVE: Stand by.
###326 Between 300 megahertz and 300 gigahertz.
###330 Honestly, who cares?
###334 Even though the microwave is cool, it's not harnessing the
###336 power of the sun, and to do that it's time to head over to
###339 arts and crafts, science style.
###341 In order to make our solar cooker, you're going to need a
###343 recycled pizza box, preferably your own.
###346 Just pick off the old remnants there, it'll
###348 be perfectly fine.
###349 Close it up, we're going to make a window
###351 inside here as well.
###352 To do that, I'm going to take a ruler and measure a two inch
###355 border all the way around so I can cut
###357 out the perfect window.
###359 You're going to leave the back, so that
###360 you don't cut it.
###361 We're going to cut these three sides.
###363 
###366 And bam, done.
###369 This is our flap.
###372 Perfect.
###374 We need some aluminum foil.
###377 We're covering the bottom here, so it reflects the sun.
###379 We're also going to put it on the inside
###381 of the flap as well.
###383 We're going to glue both of these in place, so we really
###385 have a way to be able to trap the sun's
###386 energy inside our cooker.
###389 So now it's a matter of using a little glue stick to just
###391 glue the aluminum foil to the box.
###394 
###399 Next thing you're going to need is a piece of plastic.
###400 These are just pieces of plastic bag that we opened up
###403 and taped together.
###404 This is going to go over the opening like this and now
###407 we're going to take packing tape and you're
###410 going to seal the edges.
###411 We want to trap as much of that solar energy in the box
###413 as possible.
###414 Just as we saw with the UV beads, the solar energy can go
###417 through the plastic with no problem at all.
###419 We just want to be able to trap that energy inside the
###421 box and not allow that heat to come back out.
###424 
###427 Let's see if it worked.
###428 It's a perfect window.
###431 And black absorbs heat, so it only makes sense to take a
###434 black square of paper and put it right here, on the very
###438 bottom, to be able to concentrate the heat here is
###440 very, very center.
###441 So all the reflected light goes right here to the center
###444 and this will be our cooking surface.
###447 Glue it down and you're ready to go.
###448 
###457 But there is one more problem.
###459 And that is, this lid won't stay open.
###462 But I've got a solution for that.
###465 Higginsworth.
###467 In a little bit more.
###469 Perfect.
###471 Fixed.
###472 So let's say you don't have a Higginsworth, that's where
###475 this skewer comes in.
###476 Watch.
###477 You put the tape in place like this, and now, you lift it up,
###482 and it rests right there.
###485 Voila.
###486 Let's review.
###487 The object you want to cook goes inside.
###490 Now, the reflective part gets folded down here, the handy
###494 dandy adjustable reflector gets opened up, positioned
###497 perfectly to catch all of the sun's rays, this gets held
###501 right in place, and you've got yourself a solar cooker.
###505 So now, let's head back out to our campgrounds
###507 and see if it works.
###509 In the wilds of pristine, beautiful Colorado.
###513 Nobody around.
###514 Takes me hours to get there.
###517 Don't even see any wildlife.
###518 It's just me, my cooker, and my tent.
###522 And my iPhone and a computer and an iPad.
###528 That's it.
###529 That's all I need.
###530 And a cooler, and a propane tank.
###535 That's pretty much all I need.
###538 And some Taco Bell, just in case.
###539 I get hungry.
###542 That's all I need.
###544 
###557 Oh, Higginsworth, my ice melted.
###559 Can you get me some more ice?
###562 On me please, right on me.
###563 Thank you.
###566 Can you hurry?
###567 I'm really hot.
###570 Ding.
###570 Mmm, mmm, it's done, and it only took 3 and 1/2 hours.
###575 Lucky for me, I was wearing plenty of sunscreen.
###578 
###599 No need for this anymore.
###600 
###605 Perfect.
###606 
###613 Perfect.
###615 Two more.
###616
