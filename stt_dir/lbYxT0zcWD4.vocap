###11 GRACE HELBIG: When I was younger, I wanted to be in the
###14 Swim With the Dolphins program.
###15 I also wanted to be a veterinarian.
###17 I wanted to be an Olympic gymnast.
###19 I wanted to be a professional horseback rider.
###22 The idea of making money on the internet was nowhere in my
###27 brain ever as a possibility.
###29 No way.
###31 Well, it was confusing because every time I told my parents
###33 that I make web videos, my mom thought it was porn.
###36 Welcome to the internet!
###37 
###44 Hi.
###44 I'm Grace Helbig, but on the internet, I go by Daily Grace.
###48 I host My Damn Channel Live Thursdays, and I have a daily
###51 vlog called Daily Grace.
###53 
###57 Byeee!
###58 [RECORD SCRATCH]
###59 GRACE HELBIG: I think it's time for some ass play.
###61 So I grew up in beautiful, beautiful South Jersey.
###65 But I grew up in a family of brothers.
###68 I have two brothers and three stepbrothers.
###71 And I really thought they were the funniest people in the
###77 entire world.
###78 I remember one day on a car ride, I was doing an
###81 impersonation of Cartman from South Park.
###84 That's Kenny's creamed corn.
###85 CARTMAN FROM SOUTH PARK: And you will respect mah
###86 authoritah.
###88 GRACE HELBIG: Doesn't sound anything like Cartman, but
###90 they loved it.
###92 And the one day that I did make them laugh was the day I
###95 was like, so validated and was on such a pursuit to keep that
###101 feeling going.
###103 Michelle and I lived together senior year and then moved to
###105 Brooklyn together after we graduated.
###108 MICHELLE VARGAS: Hello.
###108 GRACE HELBIG: Hi.
###109 MICHELLE VARGAS: I'm Michelle.
###109 GRACE HELBIG: I'm Grace.
###110 MICHELLE VARGAS: And we're GraceNMichelle.
###112 GRACE HELBIG: What?
###112 MICHELLE VARGAS: What?
###113 GRACE HELBIG: Welcome to the brand new--
###114 GRACE N MICHELLE: Totally T1tz Tuesday!
###118 GRACE HELBIG: So when I moved to Brooklyn, Michelle and I
###120 were doing our GraceNMichelle.
###124 and I was working for Viacom at the time in project
###126 management, all while doing improv at the
###128 People's Improv Theater.
###130 And I am not good at managing projects.
###133 And I also wanted to really pursue a more creative
###136 lifestyle than sitting behind a desk.
###138 So I quit.
###139 GRACENMICHELLE: That's great!
###141 GRACE HELBIG: How do you say it in Spanish?
###143 Tittays?
###144 And through the theater I got a casting call for a web
###147 series called Bedtime Stories.
###149 That was the first thing in New York that I ever booked.
###153 GRACE HELBIG: Hansel and Gretel.
###156 Hansel noticed the witch walked kind of
###158 funny and took a shot.
###159 Do you suffer from vaginal dryness?
###162 Why, yes, that's true.
###163 Hansel removed a tube from his pocket and said, then Lubricil
###167 may be the answer.
###168 Come back next time when you'll hear the fable of the
###171 Elf and the Glory Hole.
###173 I didn't realize that it was a web series going up on
###175 MyDamnChannel.com.
###177 And Rob Barnett, the CEO of My Damn Channel, called me in and
###180 said, we want someone to host our website.
###183 [MUSIC - MY DAMN CHANNEL LIVE THEME SONG]
###185 
###189 GRACE HELBIG: If you guys missed yesterday's show with
###191 Michael Showalter, here's a clip.
###194 MICHAEL SHOWALTER: What do you think about Skittles?
###196 BETH HOYT: I have nothing.
###197 I just, I had some today.
###199 MICHAEL SHOWALTER: You had Skittles today?
###200 BETH HOYT: Yeah.
###200 I didn't buy them.
###201 They were just in front of me, and I would never refuse a
###204 bowl of Skittles.
###204 I like the sound of the clink-clink of the Skittles.
###207 What about you?
###207 MICHAEL SHOWALTER: Skittles make a
###208 lovely clink-clink sound.
###211 GRACE HELBIG: They do make a lovely clink-clink sound.
###214 So it's not just, here's a bunch of content.
###216 Watch it.
###216 Instead it'd be me, going, hey, what'd you
###220 guys think of this?
###221 What'd you think of this?
###222 Let's have an internet dialogue with each other.
###224 A coworker doesn't seem to understand the concept of
###227 personal space.
###228 How do I tell him to step back?
###230 OK.
###231 This is my suggestion to you.
###233 You get up real close to him, super-duper close--
###237 well, he's already probably close to you.
###238 You just say, listen, friend.
###242 I have unpredictable diarrhea right now.
###246 
###251 Do your farts smell as good as you look?
###255 No.
###257 No, they don't.
###258 And then it grew.
###260 Four years later, I'm making a video every day.
###263 I get to do my own comedy pieces every day.
###266 I write, shoot, edit all of it myself from home.
###269 
###273 These are business expenses.
###276 A lot of my day is just sitting around
###279 playing with toys.
###280 
###284 What is Grace at home?
###285 Grace at home is pretty mellow, pretty low-key.
###289 Until this guy goes on.
###291 And then shit goes crazy.
###294 There's my face.
###296 Crazy.
###296 Total magic.
###298 Record audio.
###300 Record video.
###302 Hi, guys.
###303 And the [GARBLED]
###305 mouth.
###306 
###309 Get away from me, flies.
###310 So I don't know if you guys saw the Jim Carrey vlog
###316 proclaiming his love for Emma Stone.
###318 This is a message for Pat Sajak.
###321 Pat.
###322 Can I buy a your dick in my vagina?
###328 I'd like to solve the puzzle.
###330 [BLEEP]
###330 me.
###332 The internet is great because--
###335 the reach.
###336 It can just reach so many people at one time.
###340 I could never do that on a stage at the
###343 People's Improv Theater.
###344 I can reach 100 people, maybe, at that stage.
###347 But I can reach 100,000 people when I post a video every day.
###352 They appreciate the work that I put into it so thoroughly.
###357 I just got a PO box a little while ago, so people send fan
###362 art and all kinds of stuff.
###363 Yeah.
###363 People are so talented, and it's crazy.
###366 It's so crazy.
###367 These kids are insanely talented.
###370 And look.
###370 Look at that.
###371 That's insane.
###373 I make web videos, and then people make this.
###376 What?
###377 Crazy.
###379 Hey, guys.
###379 It's Friday here on Daily Grace, and you
###383 know what that means.
###384 Sexy Friday.
###385 Sexy Friday.
###386 Sexy Friday.
###387 It's a lot of teenage girls that don't want to be the
###393 pretty, vapid girl.
###394 They like being awkward or silly or weird or funny.
###397 And I want to keep them feeling like they should do
###401 that, and that there is a place for that, and it's fun
###405 to be that way, and to just enjoy themselves.
###407 So I think--
###408 it sounds cheesy, but the thing that I want to do is
###410 just to keep these girls feeling good about themselves.
###415 Bye!
###416 [DING]
###417 
###420 RYAN DUFFY: So Grace gets really cute t-shirts from her
###422 fans, and I get letters from inmates with
###423 weird stains on them.
###425 Next up, we're going to teach you how to get from point A to
###428 point B without looking like a complete and total dipshit in
###431 the process.
###432 This is Etiquette Update with John Martin.
###433 
###439 JOHN MARTIN: Here are some rules for airport travel.
###443 When you're in an airport, you always walk fast, to the left,
###446 on moving sidewalks and escalators.
###448 Know those people on the right?
###450 People in sweat pants.
###452 Or velour pants.
###457 Those are what failed businessmen become
###459 when they have kids.
###461 Those are their kids.
###462 
###467 Dropped an ice.
###468 
###472 Spend $400 a year on a decent credit card.
###475 It'll get you in the airport lounge.
###476 And the beauty of that is it'll get you away from
###479 numbskull Floridians with low-hanging pants.
###481 No one wants to look at that as they're boarding a 12-hour
###484 flight to Mumbai.
###485 
###489 RYAN DUFFY: Etiquette tips from a guy who can't even sip
###491 a gin and tonic without spilling on himself.
###493 Thanks, John.

###497 come back for brand new episodes
