( Girl ) People once believed
that when someone dies...

a crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.

But sometimes,
something so bad happens...

0:0:53,775 --> 0:0:58,895
that a terrible sadness is carried
with it and the soul can't rest.


7
0:0:58,895 --> 0:1:1,894
Then sometimes,
just sometimes...


8
0:1:1,894 --> 0:1:6,774

0:32:34,281 --> 0:32:43,28
Seeing is believing,
isn't it?


370
0:32:43,28 --> 0:32:46,999
( Door Opening, Closing )


371
0:32:46,999 --> 0:32:54,998
Mmm, yummy.


372
0:32:54,998 --> 0:32:58,878
Gideon's pawnshop just burned down
to the foundation.


373
0:32:58,878 --> 0:33:2,37
Nobody cleared
this little event with me.


374
0:33:2,37 --> 0:33:3,797
I didn't have nothing
to do with that.


375
0:33:3,797 --> 0:33:6,437
( Man ) You must be
awfully disappointed.


376
0:33:6,437 --> 0:33:9,676
I got trouble.
One of my crew got himself perished.


377
0:33:9,676 --> 0:33:11,956
- Yeah, who might that be?
- Tin Tin.


378
0:33:11,956 --> 0:33:16,395
Somebody stuck his blades in all his
major organs in alphabetical order.


379
0:33:16,395 --> 0:33:18,955
Gentlemen, by all means,
I think we ought to have...


380
0:33:18,955 --> 0:33:24,554
an introspective moment of silence
for poor, old Tin Tin.


381
0:33:24,554 --> 0:33:27,114
You're working for me
tomorrow night, right?


382
0:33:27,114 --> 0:33:29,833
- Whatever you say, I can do.
- Good.


383
0:33:29,833 --> 0:33:32,593
That's very reassuring.


384
0:33:32,593 --> 0:33:36,553
I still ain't heard
why Gideon's burned down.


385
0:33:36,553 --> 0:33:40,912
Is that a natural catastrophe
or act of God or something?


386
0:33:40,912 --> 0:34:8,508
Call it my need to know.


387
0:34:8,508 --> 0:34:12,428
( Sighing )


388
0:34:12,428 --> 0:34:14,907
( Honking, Tires Screeching )


389
0:34:14,907 --> 0:34:20,587
Let go, you creep!


390
0:34:20,587 --> 0:34:22,346
- Nah.
- ( Laughing )


391
0:34:22,346 --> 0:34:26,866
You didn't even slow down,
you dickhead!


392
0:34:26,866 --> 0:34:29,225
He couldn't have stopped.


393
0:34:29,225 --> 0:34:33,425
He was a buttface.
I could have made it.


394
0:34:33,425 --> 0:34:36,425
What are you supposed to be,
a clown or something?


395
0:34:36,425 --> 0:34:40,304
Sometimes.


396
0:34:40,304 --> 0:34:45,983
It's more like surfing than skating.
I wish the rain would stop, just once.


397
0:34:45,983 --> 0:34:58,302
- It can't rain all the time.
- Eric?


398
0:34:58,302 --> 0:35:5,581
( Phone Ringing )


399
0:35:5,581 --> 0:35:10,6
Don't thank me.
Are we fighting the good fight?


400
0:35:10,6 --> 0:35:14,299
Double homicide a year ago.
No convictions.


401
0:35:14,299 --> 0:35:17,659
Annie... look at that.


402
0:35:17,659 --> 0:35:21,778
"We, the undersigned tenants of
1929 Caulderon Court Apartments--"


403
0:35:21,778 --> 0:35:23,818
What is this, a petition?


404
0:35:23,818 --> 0:35:26,658
Big "kick me" sign for a very nice girl
who found herself a cause.


405
0:35:26,658 --> 0:35:30,657
- The cause got her killed.
- She was fighting tenant eviction
in that neighborhood?


406
0:35:30,657 --> 0:35:36,376
Shelly Webster and her nice
rock-and-roll boyfriend, Eric Draven.


407
0:35:36,376 --> 0:35:39,856
The last time you snooped around a case
is when you got put back on the beat.


408
0:35:39,856 --> 0:35:50,415
- I know. Torres keeps reminding me.
- I bet he does.


409
0:35:50,415 --> 0:35:54,54
You're going to wind up
working a school crosswalk.


410
0:35:54,54 --> 0:35:56,174
I'm cool.


411
0:35:56,174 --> 0:36:0,773
You didn't get that file from me, okay?
And don't tell me you owe me one.


412
0:36:0,773 --> 0:36:3,253
Ah, I owe you one!


413
0:36:3,253 --> 0:36:5,253
Yeah, right.


414

- It's a squab.

your bird and leave, freako.

Take your shot, Funboy.
You got me dead bang.

You are seriously fucked up.
Did you look in the mirror?


443
0:38:14,995 --> 0:38:20,75

Morphine is bad for you.

- ( Door Squeaking )
- the site of last year's biggest
Devil's Night conflagration.


489
0:42:44,679 --> 0:42:47,599
It was exactly one year ago
that the building you see...


490
0:42:47,599 --> 0:42:50,478
across the street from me
was totally demolished by fire.


491
0:42:50,478 --> 0:42:52,638
The fire that was fought
by seven fire companies...


492
0:42:52,638 --> 0:42:54,758
but lost the lives
of two fire fighters.


493
0:42:54,758 --> 0:42:59,397
In fact, if it weren't for the constant
surveillance by the local police--

Freeze!

Good likeness.


498
0:43:11,636 --> 0:43:15,275
I saw your body, man.
You died. You got buried.


499
0:43:15,275 --> 0:43:21,194
You still have your hat on.


500
0:43:21,194 --> 0:43:23,954

0:43:32,633 --> 0:43:36,832
are you some kind of... ghost?


505
0:43:36,832 --> 0:43:45,991
Boo!


506
0:43:45,991 --> 0:43:52,27
I don't know what I am. I need you
to tell me what happened to us.


507
0:43:52,27 --> 0:43:56,27
You took a six-story swan dive
out of a window.


508
0:43:56,27 --> 0:43:59,309
She, ah, was beaten and raped.


509
0:43:59,309 --> 0:44:3,789
Died at the hospital.
Hey, you asked, man.


510
0:44:3,789 --> 0:44:6,388
Come on. Read the file.


511
0:44:6,388 --> 0:44:10,628
Shelly Webster held on
for 30 hours in intensive care.


512
0:44:10,628 --> 0:44:13,747
Her body finally just gave it up.


513
0:44:13,747 --> 0:44:26,945
I saw it.
I couldn't do jack for her.


514
0:44:26,945 --> 0:44:28,865
- Hey.
- Don't touch me!


515
0:44:28,865 --> 0:44:34,65

- Hey.

517
0:44:36,824 --> 0:44:40,984
I saw her.


518
0:44:40,984 --> 0:44:44,223
I saw her
through your eyes.


519
0:44:44,223 --> 0:44:46,303
You stayed with her
the whole time.


520
0:44:46,303 --> 0:44:51,622
Yeah, well, you got to
understand something, all right?


521
0:44:51,622 --> 0:44:56,222
I was hoping
she'd come out of it, you know.


522
0:44:56,222 --> 0:44:59,101
Give me something
I could work with.


523
0:44:59,101 --> 0:45:1,301
Yeah.


524
0:45:1,301 --> 0:45:3,701
Look, I--


525
0:45:3,701 --> 0:45:6,18
Why didn't you do
something about it?


526
0:45:6,18 --> 0:45:9,46
You think any people in that building,
even the ones who signed the petition...


527
0:45:9,46 --> 0:45:12,859
would talk after
what happened to you?


528
0:45:12,859 --> 0:45:16,19
I kept asking
questions and...


529
0:45:16,19 --> 0:45:22,418
finally got busted for sticking
my nose where it wasn't wanted.


530
0:45:22,418 --> 0:45:24,378
This your wife?


531
0:45:24,378 --> 0:45:30,457
Yeah, we, uh-- Well, not anymore,
we're getting a divorce.


532
0:45:30,457 --> 0:45:33,337
It's funny.


533
0:45:33,337 --> 0:45:37,256
Little things used to mean
so much to Shelly.


534
0:45:37,256 --> 0:45:40,696
I used to think
they were kind of trivial.


535
0:45:40,696 --> 0:45:52,814
Believe me,
nothing is trivial.


536
0:45:52,814 --> 0:46:1,573
You shouldn't smoke these.
They'll kill you.


537
0:46:1,573 --> 0:46:8,132
You going to vanish
into thin air again?


538
0:46:8,132 --> 0:46:13,651
I thought I'd use
your front door.


539
0:46:13,651 --> 0:46:20,73
Look, man, I'm sorry as hell for what
happened to you and your girlfriend.


540
0:46:20,73 --> 0:46:27,329
Yeah.


541
0:46:27,329 --> 0:46:29,889
- ( Door Opening, Closing )
- ( Whispering ) Yeah.


542
0:46:29,889 --> 0:46:33,329
( Gideon ) I got stabbed!
I shot the son of a bitch!


543
0:46:33,329 --> 0:46:36,408
I watched the bullet hole
close by itself.


544
0:46:36,408 --> 0:46:39,408
And then my business
gets blown up real good.


545
0:46:39,408 --> 0:46:42,567
- Other than that, my day sucked.
- Yeah.


546
0:46:42,567 --> 0:46:45,87
I saw him too.
He had a guitar.


547
0:46:45,87 --> 0:46:49,406
He winked at me before he jumped out
a fourth-floor window like he had wings.


548
0:46:49,406 --> 0:46:54,286
He winked at ya?
Musicians.


549
0:46:54,286 --> 0:46:56,725
- What else did you see?
- So far I haven't heard...


550
0:46:56,725 --> 0:46:59,205
shit about what you're going to do
about all this crap!

What do I get? My livelihood
got flushed and went swirling.

You ain't lost everything.


553
0:47:7,284 --> 0:47:12,243
Yeah, and maybe you're not
such a big shot either! Ow! Jesus!


554
0:47:12,243 --> 0:47:16,763
Fair enough. Catch.

Aah! Jesus.

What're you telling me,
this thing is real?


558

All the power in the world
resides in the eyes, fella.

Sometimes they're more useful
than the people who bear them.

Yeah.

0:47:37,64 --> 0:47:42,679
Eyes see. It's one of the most important
things I learned from my sister.


563
0:47:42,679 --> 0:47:45,879
Sister? She's supposed to be
your sister? ( Laughing )


564
0:47:45,879 --> 0:47:49,158
My father's daughter.
That's right.


565

What's the matter,
you don't see the resemblance?


566
0:47:52,278 --> 0:47:54,518
Now, let's take it
from the top, friend.

With a lot of detail.
What do you say?


568
0:47:57,997 --> 0:48:1,397
He had a bird with him.
Nearly pecked my face off.


569
0:48:1,397 --> 0:48:4,716
He told me to tell T-bird
that death was on its way.


570
0:48:4,716 --> 0:48:6,916
Whatever the fuck that means.


571
0:48:6,916 --> 0:48:11,595

was Eric Draven.

that thing now?


573

to let you live, huh?

just to save your own ass?

- ( Meows )


729
1:1:32,448 --> 1:1:35,168
I thought you were dead.


730
1:1:35,168 --> 1:2:2,84
You're not dead, are you?


731
1:2:2,84 --> 1:2:6,724
I knew it was you.


732
1:2:6,724 --> 1:2:14,163
Even with the makeup.


733
1:2:14,163 --> 1:2:16,722
I remembered your song.


734
1:2:16,722 --> 1:2:20,402
You said,
"Can't rain all the time."


735
1:2:20,402 --> 1:2:33,4
That is from your song, right?


736
1:2:33,4 --> 1:2:38,319
- ( Cawing )
- Come on, Eric. I know you're here.


737
1:2:38,319 --> 1:2:45,198
I miss you...
and Shelly.


738
1:2:45,198 --> 1:2:50,278
Get so lonely
all by myself.


739
1:2:50,278 --> 1:2:54,797
The hell with you.
I thought you cared.


740
1:2:54,797 --> 1:3:8,555
Sarah, I do care.


741
1:3:8,555 --> 1:3:10,675
That's him.
That's him!


742
1:3:10,675 --> 1:3:13,955
But he looked different. He was painted
up white like some kind of dead whore.


743
1:3:13,955 --> 1:3:17,154
I seen him. T-bird sent me in
for some road beers, right?


744
1:3:17,154 --> 1:3:19,674
Then he took him away.
But I chased him down.


745
1:3:19,674 --> 1:3:22,433
And he flash fried T-bird
to his fucking car!


746
1:3:22,433 --> 1:3:25,873
Aw, T-bird!
Here's to you, buddy.


747
1:3:25,873 --> 1:3:30,912
Maybe we oughta just videotape this.
Play it back in slow motion.


748
1:3:30,912 --> 1:3:35,392
- Fire it up! Fire it up!
- You see the grave?


749
1:3:35,392 --> 1:3:37,951
- Empty.
- Fire it--


750
1:3:37,951 --> 1:3:39,871
Grave?
What grave?


751
1:3:39,871 --> 1:3:42,71
What about
my fucking grave?


752
1:3:42,71 --> 1:3:43,431
- ( Screams )
- Three out of four.


753
1:3:43,431 --> 1:3:46,63
He's working his way back
to this speed freak right here.


754
1:3:46,63 --> 1:3:49,23
It's not fair.
It's Funboy's fault.


755
1:3:49,23 --> 1:3:52,349
That boy was out of control.
T-bird, he came in, he says...
( Whistles )


756
1:3:52,349 --> 1:3:55,589
..."Waste them both." And now
this ghost gonna kill my ass next!


757
1:3:55,589 --> 1:3:59,388
( Groaning )


758
1:3:59,388 --> 1:4:2,428
This ghost gonna
kill my ass next.


759
1:4:2,428 --> 1:4:6,108
- This ghost gonna kill--
- Hey.


760
1:4:6,108 --> 1:4:9,827
That ain't no ghost.


761
1:4:9,827 --> 1:4:12,907
- They have all arrived.
- Watch him.


762
1:4:12,907 --> 1:4:16,266
We might need him.


763
1:4:16,266 --> 1:4:30,824
Ghost gonna kill my--


764
1:4:30,824 --> 1:4:34,664
He like his plain
or with onions?


765
1:4:34,664 --> 1:4:38,23
Fine.
Don't talk to me.


766
1:4:38,23 --> 1:4:42,23
When someone's dead,
they can't come back, can they?


767
1:4:42,23 --> 1:4:44,582
That's what I thought.


768
1:4:44,582 --> 1:4:47,302
Are you referring
to anyone in particular?


769
1:4:47,302 --> 1:4:49,542
You'll just think
I'm nuts.


770
1:4:49,542 --> 1:4:53,101
Yeah, well, then maybe
they'll have to lock us both up.


771
1:4:53,101 --> 1:4:58,301
- You see him too?
- I saw somebody.


772
1:4:58,301 --> 1:5:1,74
Maybe it was
your fairy godfather.


773
1:5:1,74 --> 1:5:4,62
Eric didn't come back for me.


774
1:5:4,62 --> 1:5:9,259
He can't be my friend anymore
because I'm alive.


775
1:5:9,259 --> 1:5:12,379
You want a friend
to walk you home?

It seems our friend T-bird won't be
joining us this evening...


789
1:6:48,806 --> 1:6:50,886
on account of
a slight case of death.

start a bunch of fires,
make a little profit.

Problem is, it's all been done before.
You see what I'm saying?


798
1:7:15,2 --> 1:7:20,82
- That's no reason to quit.
- Wrong. Best reason to quit.


799
1:7:20,82 --> 1:7:22,441
Only reason to quit.

1:7:22,441 --> 1:7:27,801
A man has an idea.

802
1:7:30,4 --> 1:7:32,12
like-minded.


803
1:7:32,12 --> 1:7:34,2
The idea expands.


804
1:7:34,2 --> 1:7:37,759
The idea becomes
an institution.


805
1:7:37,759 --> 1:7:40,399
What was the idea?


806
1:7:40,399 --> 1:7:44,78
See, that's what's
been bothering me, boys.


807
1:7:44,78 --> 1:7:46,838
But I'll tell ya, when I used
to think about the idea itself...


808
1:7:46,838 --> 1:7:49,878
it'd put a big old smile on my face.


809

You see, gentlemen...

- What about Devil's Night?
- What about it?


814
1:8:6,795 --> 1:8:10,115
I started the first fires
in this goddamn city.


815
1:8:10,115 --> 1:8:13,154
Before I knew it, every charlatan
and shitheel was imitating me.


816

Do you know
what they got now?


817
1:8:16,514 --> 1:8:20,673

1:8:23,553 --> 1:8:25,633
Yeah.

1:8:30,272 --> 1:8:32,312
Time to move along.

1:8:32,312 --> 1:8:34,712
You don't want us to do
"Light My Fire" time for the whole city?

No.

- The crow...

and destroy the man.

to have it.

1:18:2,996 --> 1:18:5,355
Shh. Take it easy, sweetheart.


917
1:18:5,355 --> 1:18:11,954
( Muffled Screaming Continues )


918
1:18:11,954 --> 1:18:27,72
Come on.
Come on.


919
1:18:27,72 --> 1:18:32,552
What is that? Some sort of souvenir
there from your pal?


920
1:18:32,552 --> 1:18:41,71
I'll just keep it for good luck.
What do you say, hmm?


921
1:18:41,71 --> 1:18:55,748
Her eyes are so innocent.


922
1:18:55,748 --> 1:18:57,668
- ( Sarah ) Eric!
- ( Caws )


923
1:18:57,668 --> 1:19:4,907
Eric, help! Eric!


924
1:19:4,907 --> 1:19:9,867

( Crow Flapping, Caws )


927
1:19:39,303 --> 1:19:42,462
Quick impression for ya.


928
1:19:42,462 --> 1:19:46,102
Caw! Caw! Bang!
Fuck, I'm dead!


929
1:19:46,102 --> 1:19:49,381
Give me the girl
and I'll let you walk out of here.


930
1:19:49,381 --> 1:19:52,381
( Inhales )
Well, well.


931
1:19:52,381 --> 1:20:0,26
Why don't you just give me a minute
to think about that, huh?


932
1:20:0,26 --> 1:20:3,619
( Cawing )


933
1:20:3,619 --> 1:20:11,578
Nah. Fuck it.

935
1:20:13,938 --> 1:20:19,57
Aw, fuck.

( Muffled Screaming )


937
1:20:22,937 --> 1:20:27,376
Well, well, well. It does seem to me
that our little life has undergone...


938
1:20:27,376 --> 1:20:31,136
a rather significant change in the past
few minutes now. Wouldn't you agree?


939
1:20:31,136 --> 1:20:35,215
( Groaning )


940
1:20:35,215 --> 1:20:41,854
Well, for a ghost,
you bleed just fine.


941
1:20:41,854 --> 1:20:45,614
- It's still alive.
- Well, then kill it!


942
1:20:45,614 --> 1:21:30,968
Bye-bye, birdie.


943
1:21:30,968 --> 1:21:33,47
Ah, shit.


944
1:21:33,47 --> 1:21:35,127
Well, just came by
to pay my respects...


945
1:21:35,127 --> 1:21:37,167
and here you are
getting all shot up again.


946
1:21:37,167 --> 1:21:39,726
- They've taken Sarah.
- How many?


947
1:21:39,726 --> 1:21:41,686
Two more.
( Groans )


948
1:21:41,686 --> 1:21:43,686
I can handle it.
Don't worry.


949
1:21:43,686 --> 1:21:46,166
I'm not worried.
Look, here's the plan.


950
1:21:46,166 --> 1:21:48,885
You stay in front, and when they
run out of ammo, I'll arrest 'em.


951
1:21:48,885 --> 1:21:55,4
That sounds like a great plan.
There's just one problem.


952
1:21:55,4 --> 1:21:58,484
Oh, shit.
You're bleeding all over the place.


953
1:21:58,484 --> 1:22:0,524
I thought, you know,
you were invincible.


954
1:22:0,524 --> 1:22:3,923
I was.
I'm not anymore.


955
1:22:3,923 --> 1:22:8,43
( Sighs ) Well, I guess you really will
need my help, won't you?


956
1:22:8,43 --> 1:22:13,402
- Come on.
- ( Groaning )


957
1:22:13,402 --> 1:22:44,198
You take that.


958
1:22:44,198 --> 1:23:8,755
- You were supposed to stay behind me.
- I think I messed up.


959
1:23:8,755 --> 1:23:10,634
( Crow Caws )


960
1:23:10,634 --> 1:23:13,794
This is all the power
you ever had.


961
1:23:13,794 --> 1:23:15,874
Now it is mine.


962
1:23:15,874 --> 1:23:19,513
Pity there's not more time...


963
1:23:19,513 --> 1:23:23,393
- ( Gun Cocks )
- ...for us.


964
1:23:23,393 --> 1:23:30,512

( Sarah ) Help, Eric!
I'm scared!


968
1:23:44,19 --> 1:23:55,348
Let me go!


969
1:23:55,348 --> 1:23:58,788
Let her go!


970
1:23:58,788 --> 1:24:1,587
You can have me.
I won't fight you.


971
1:24:1,587 --> 1:24:3,267
You can have me.
I won't fight you.


972
1:24:3,267 --> 1:24:5,267
All right.


973
1:24:5,267 --> 1:24:10,866

- ( Panting )
- Eric!


985
1:25:28,656 --> 1:25:30,816
You know,
my daddy used to say...


986
1:25:30,816 --> 1:25:33,295
"Every man's got a devil...


987
1:25:33,295 --> 1:25:35,415
and you can't rest
till you find him."


988
1:25:35,415 --> 1:25:37,935
What happened back there
with you and your girlfriend--


989
1:25:37,935 --> 1:25:40,814
I cleared that building.


990
1:25:40,814 --> 1:25:44,14
Hell, nothing in this town
happens without my say-so.


991
1:25:44,14 --> 1:25:46,813
So I'm sorry if I spoiled
your wedding plans, friend.


992
1:25:46,813 --> 1:25:49,613
But if it's any consolation
to you...


993
1:25:49,613 --> 1:25:53,173
you have put
a smile on my face.


994
1:25:53,173 --> 1:25:55,732
You got a lot
of spirit, son.


995
1:25:55,732 --> 1:25:58,292
( Unsheathes Knife )
I am going to miss you.


996

I have something
to give you.

1:26:0,812 --> 1:26:7,411
I don't want it anymore.


998
1:26:7,411 --> 1:26:12,53
Thirty hours of pain!

- All at once!

1000
1:26:15,21 --> 1:26:31,367

- All for you.

1:26:42,646 --> 1:26:52,245
Yeah.


1003
1:26:52,245 --> 1:26:58,164
Go help him.


1004

Are you alive?


1005
1:27:2,283 --> 1:27:11,842
( Groans )
God, I need a cigarette.


1006
1:27:11,842 --> 1:27:13,762
Everybody else dead?


1007
1:27:13,762 --> 1:27:16,41
You helped me.


1008
1:27:16,41 --> 1:27:18,561
What you kept in here
saved me.


1009
1:27:18,561 --> 1:27:21,641
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.


1010
1:27:21,641 --> 1:27:29,32
I've been meaning
to come to church anyway.


1011
1:27:29,32 --> 1:27:32,39
Oh, yuck.
( Spits )


1012
1:27:32,39 --> 1:27:44,958
I'm quitting as of now...
if I live.


1013
1:27:44,958 --> 1:27:48,317
Stay with him
until help comes.


1014
1:27:48,317 --> 1:27:51,717
He'll be okay, right?


1015
1:27:51,717 --> 1:27:55,236
Eric?


1016
1:27:55,236 --> 1:28:0,476

He does that a lot.

Shelly.


1021
1:28:28,352 --> 1:28:33,71
- All right, what's going on in there?
- Multiple homicides.


1022
1:28:33,71 --> 1:28:35,711
At least it stopped raining, huh?


1023
1:28:35,711 --> 1:28:39,7
- It can't rain all the time.
- No, I don't believe it.


1024
1:28:39,7 --> 1:28:42,31
- This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?
- Look, you go on home.


1025
1:28:42,31 --> 1:28:44,23
- I'm okay.
- Okay.


1026

- Want to tell me what's going on?
- Your vigilante's up on the roof.


1027
1:28:48,709 --> 1:28:50,749
You missed it.


1028
1:28:50,749 --> 1:28:53,388
Get him outta here!

1:28:53,388 --> 1:29:54,86
( Chuckling )


1030
1:29:54,86 --> 1:30:1,739
Thanks.


1031
1:30:1,739 --> 1:30:4,739
( Sarah ) If the people we love
are stolen from us...


1032
1:30:4,739 --> 1:30:9,698
the way to have them live on
is to never stop loving them.


1033
1:30:9,698 --> 1:30:18,4
Buildings burn, people die,
but real love is forever.

1:35:18,817 --> 1:35:21,696
* Your tears won't fall *


1103
1:35:21,696 --> 1:35:27,776
* Your tears won't fall *


1104
1:35:27,776 --> 1:35:53,492
* Forever **


1105
1:35:53,492 --> 1:36:1,331
* Driving faster in my car *


1106
1:36:1,331 --> 1:36:9,17
* Falling farther
from just what we are *


1107
1:36:9,17 --> 1:36:13,649
* Smoke a cigarette
and lie some more *


1108
1:36:13,649 --> 1:36:17,9
* These conversations kill *


1109
1:36:17,9 --> 1:36:24,208
* Falling faster in my car *


1110
1:36:24,208 --> 1:36:26,928
* Time to take her home *


1111
1:36:26,928 --> 1:36:31,407
* Her dizzy head
is conscience laden *


1112
1:36:31,407 --> 1:36:34,447
* Time to take a ride *


1113
1:36:34,447 --> 1:36:38,926
* It leaves today
no conversation *


1114
1:36:38,926 --> 1:36:41,806
* Time to take her home *


1115
1:36:41,806 --> 1:36:46,405
* Her dizzy head
is conscience laden *


1116
1:36:46,405 --> 1:36:51,364
* Time to wait too long
to wait too long *


1117
1:36:51,364 --> 1:38:51,364
* Way too long **
