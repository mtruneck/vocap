###15 Can you achieve balance? I would take people that believe in nature and let them build
###20 a natural farm, and people believe in science live in this city. All the cities would be
###28 saner in design, but there'd be different value systems and you can check them out,
###33 see how it works. If you wanna live on organic food and you have a community of 40,000 people,
###41 living on organic food, they're all healthier, but mentally they're not. Physically they're
###48 in perfect shape but mentally, they believe they've made metaphysical temples and all
###55 that, you know what I mean? So, you might check out different cultures and say yes they're
###62 all healthy physically, mentally they're aborted. Do you think you know what I mean? You know
###68 Hitler was a vegetarian don't you? He didn't believe in eating living things. But his brain
###79 was no better than it was. So if a person eats nothing but organic food, never had cancer
###86 never had heart disease, but is fucked up at here, has associative disease, you know
###91 what that means? Doesn't like Swedes, or Catholics, or gays, that's associate disease. So we don't
###99 measure all of that stuff. A language is an attempt at controlling the behavior of people.
###107 It isn't a mechanism for controlling behavior, it's an attempt. People write books cause
###115 they think they can impart their values to other people, the book is only 1 piece of
###121 the action, and many other things necessary, conversing with one another, up and back,
###129 disagreements, areas where you're little foggy, not quite clear. So when I tell you that a
###137 neurologist doesn't know what the problem is, unless they're social. He has no idea
###142 if he works on the brain there's a study, how does the brain work? The brain doesn't
###148 work it responds to different cultures. Do you understand that? Asking a question how
###155 does the brain work? Can not be asked outside of the culture. You can't do that, it's like
###163 saying, how do we walk? Well, if you lived on a planet with 1 tenth of gravity, the guy
###171 says let's go for a 20 mile walk you say okay, because gravity doesn't bother you too much,
###177 but if you live in a planet with 5 times the gravity of the earth, the guy says wanna walk
###182 a hundred feet? Says that's too much for me, do you understand by you respond to the environment?
###193 Senators make laws, but they can't change natural law. They can't change the law of
###200 gravity, at a congress meeting, so it's easier to go up the steps of the capital. They can't
###206 change natural law, although to a limited extent we can affect it. So all of us live
###217 within the trap called time and culture. You know what that means? We live within the trap
###225 called time and culture. So an anthropologist can't study culture, unless he studies his
###234 own culture, and if he does, he's not gonna become an anthropologist, becomes a student
###240 of life systems. Maybe, if you know what I mean? All single professions will disappear
###250 in the future, I've no question about it. You have to become so general. Encompassing
###257 is a better word than general, cause that sounds like it's less. I can't use that word
###265 all encompassing. Well, more encompassing, more encompassing. Emotions get in the way,
###276 because they block you from looking at things in a more general viewpoint, but when you
###283 like the way you think, that's called arrested development. You said one time there's no
###289 emotional problems, what did you mean by that? Well by that I meant there are relating problems,
###303 relating to different things, and you get hopped up about it, or you get angry, or you
###310 feel depressed, the only way you should feel depressed, there are real reasons, fairly
###316 depressed if Hitler won the war and they put you both in solitary confinement, you would
###324 feel depressed, cause there's nothing you can do about it. If you were around 500 normal
###333 people, they can make you feel depressed. They can cut you out. But it depends how much
###341 you know about normal people so you don't let them do that to you. You know how far
###348 you can go, or you think how far you can go. You'll find out fast enough how far you can
###357 go. When people call up and say what is the Venus Project? You say have you got 2 weeks?
###367 You can't say this is what it is, oh thank you very much. It's like answering questions,
###372 you can't answer questions. But you still have to have a couple of sentences. Yes you
###377 do. Or you can't get around it. If you're really interested in knowing how people work,
###382 and how they relate to one another and the environment, get the book, cause you got too
###389 many calls every day to go into detail. After you get the book, if you've got problems we
###395 can discuss it. You ask a person what do you want? I want a car. No, they wanna be a certain
###403 place at a given time, that can be done by television, you know what I mean? You can't
###409 visit your aunt Minnie on a screen full size. You don't wanna drive to Aunt Minnie's, and
###416 you don't wanna drive to work, you want the pay cheque. Not every week, when you want
###423 it, right? A guy says I want a job. He doesn't know what he's talking about, he wants some
###429 money to buy the things he needs. So then he needs things, not money. You ask a person
###436 what do you want? A decent home, 40,000 dollar home? 20,000 dollar, what do you mean by decent
###448 home? But in this culture, people really can't use that kind of logic. They have to think
###456 within. They're incapable. You can give them a whole new set of tools, and there'll be
###463 people that'll be gunning for you too, cause you're taking their tools away, or their controls.
###472 So when you say, what does the Venus Project really think? That's an abstract question,
###484 depends on the situation. Lock your frame of referent. What? Said lock your frame of
###488 referent. Yeah. A person says what if you build a Venus Project and a meteor hits it
###497 and destroys it. Then we're fucked. Or we start over again if we're still around. It's
###507 just a lot of unnecessary aberrant responses. That's why I would never talk to a psychiatrist,
###514 cause they think they're on the right track. Although, there are some that know they know
###523 very little about human behavior, you know there are people like that, that have studied
###528 the field of medicine and really feel that they don't have much control over health.
###534 And a person says I want a healthy body and I say what do you want it for? If you're just
###541 healthy so what? I'd rather have a healthy mind and a warped body. You know what I mean?
###546 But what we talk about is associative systems that correlate, you know what that means?
###561 With changing conditions.
###568 You know they ask you in school what do you wanna do with your life? What a stupid question.
###574 What can I do with my life? School doesn't offer you everything. You got it? You usually
###582 say a healthy associative system correlates with the real world, but that was good, it
###587 correlates with changing conditions. Yes. More appropriate huh? Yes. Which is the real
###592 world I guess. But then you've gotta remember, you're drifting away from the average person,
###598 and you've gotta update your communication, or try. If you don't work on the people around
###607 you, you will get lost. And they might say what are you a perfectionist? You know, they
###617 have no other words. A perfectionist is a guy that died, that's it. You can't be a perfectionist.
###628 You can be particular about things. Just get away from the holistic words like truth, the
###635 absolute truth, the absolute truth. I said this before, in order to tell the truth you
###645 have to know everything, to know that which is true. Okay you guys I'm gonna relax. That
###656 was good Jacque. Thanks Jacque. So that wraps up this lecture on behavior. He's pretty busy
###666 for a guy his age who needs to be resting up after about 6 or 7 months of traveling.
###672 He actually has been drawing a lot since he got back, he did this whole stack in about,
###677 actually 3 times this much but a lot of em he just rips them up, throws them away. The
###683 usual Venus Project tours which are held on some Saturdays will resume this month so please
###688 check the website for the dates on those if you'd like to attend. Since he got back from
###694 traveling he's had a couple of groups, this particular group was out of Miami and they
###700 have to do with permaculture, and were interested in the Venus Project. He also had a small
###710 group of 3 or 4 people before them that was from his original group in Miami when it was
###717 called Sociocyberneering. So thanks for watching and keep an eye out for more lectures and
###726 other things that we'll be posting soon. Thanks. There's so much of it.
