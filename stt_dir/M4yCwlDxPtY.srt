1
0:1:47,25 --> 0:1:51,8
This blade has a dark past.


2
0:1:51,8 --> 0:1:58,0
It has shed much innocent blood.


3
0:1:58,0 --> 0:2:1,75
You're a fool for traveling alone,
so completely unprepared.


4
0:2:1,75 --> 0:2:5,25
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.


5
0:2:5,25 --> 0:2:7,5
Thank you.


6
0:2:7,5 --> 0:2:9,4
So...


7
0:2:9,4 --> 0:2:15,0
What brings you to
the land of the gatekeepers?


8
0:2:15,0 --> 0:2:18,0
I'm searching for someone.


9
0:2:18,0 --> 0:2:23,4
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?


10
0:2:23,4 --> 0:2:28,85
A dragon.


11
0:2:28,85 --> 0:2:32,95
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.


12
0:2:32,95 --> 0:3:27,25
I've been alone for
as long as I can remember.


13
0:3:27,25 --> 0:3:30,75
We're almost done. Shhh...


14
0:3:30,75 --> 0:3:48,25
Hey, sit still.


15
0:3:48,25 --> 0:4:10,35
Good night, Scales.


16
0:4:10,35 --> 0:4:25,25
Get him, Scales! Come on!


17
0:4:25,25 --> 0:5:4,0
Scales?


18
0:5:4,0 --> 0:5:38,75
Yeah! Come on!


19
0:5:38,75 --> 0:7:25,85
Scales!


20
0:7:25,85 --> 0:7:32,8
I have failed.


21
0:7:32,8 --> 0:7:37,8
You've only failed to see...


22
0:7:37,8 --> 0:7:40,85
These are dragon lands, Sintel.


23
0:7:40,85 --> 0:9:17,6
You are closer than you know.


24
0:9:17,6 --> 0:10:21,6
Scales!


25
0:10:21,6 --> 0:10:26,2
Scales?


26
0:10:26,2 --> 0:12:26,2
Scales...
