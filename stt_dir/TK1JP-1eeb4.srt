Jacque Fresco - Dec. 19, 2010 "Relation to Academia" www.thevenusproject.com ãƒ» Part 2


2
0:0:5,67 --> 0:0:14,54
What has to be done is - people should investigate the educational system of The Venus Project;


3
0:0:14,54 --> 0:0:23,56
what it offers. It must then look into the environmental aspects of The Venus Project. How we intend to support and


4
0:0:23,56 --> 0:0:31,8
restore the damaged environment. Then: what different types of vehicles would be used for transportation.


5
0:0:31,8 --> 0:0:40,59
How we solve the transportation problem. If they find shortcomings in it, say, "Present your recommendations."


6
0:0:40,59 --> 0:0:46,89
But don't say "I don't like that system." - Present your recommendations, or alternatives.


7
0:0:46,89 --> 0:0:54,4
If you want people to be safe in swimming, safe from sharks, you really don't have to make a swimming 


8
0:0:54,4 --> 0:1:2,54
pool any deeper than 5ft. You can swim in 5ft of water. Its hard to drown if you can't make it, you can reach bottom.


9
0:1:2,54 --> 0:1:8,72
And children's pools will be shallow. And you can swim in it. You can't drown in it.


10
0:1:8,72 --> 0:1:15,27
It isn't that I like shallow pools. If children have difficulty, you can't always see it.


11
0:1:15,27 --> 0:1:22,69
I think our friends child drowned because mother couldn't watch over her in the ocean.


12
0:1:22,69 --> 0:1:27,86
And she blamed the old man, the old man blamed the mother for not watching, and then they both


13
0:1:27,86 --> 0:1:34,9
blamed the lifeguard. You know. It's inadequate systems: what you're dealing with.


14
0:1:34,9 --> 0:1:36,44
Do you understand?


15
0:1:36,44 --> 0:1:41,59
I don't find lifeguards submitting new ways of watching older people on the beach.


16
0:1:41,59 --> 0:1:48,76
They're always a lifeguard. They never seem to innovate; make a life preserver connected to a cable that 


17
0:1:48,76 --> 0:1:54,1
goes out to the drowning person. That's what they need. Not the lifeguard grabbing him.


18
0:1:54,1 --> 0:1:59,6
They need the thing getting there faster. Lifeguard can only get there at a certain speed.


19
0:1:59,6 --> 0:2:5,84
So I would design a life raft that moves out very fast; stops by proximity mechanisms, and then moves 


20
0:2:5,84 --> 0:2:13,93
slowly to the person so he can grab it. And if they can't grab it, you send human assistants on a vehicle 


21
0:2:13,93 --> 0:2:22,41
out that way. Anyway, I've never heard of lifeguard associations making recommendations except


22
0:2:22,41 --> 0:2:31,22
binoculars for the lifeguard to look around. But limited, very limited. Lifeguards are not trained as innovators.


23
0:2:31,22 --> 0:2:37,47
But if you bring innovators to the system and say "How can you innovate that system to make it more efficient?"


24
0:2:37,47 --> 0:2:43,58
If a man is mechanical, he might make a life reserver connected to a cable. 


25
0:2:43,58 --> 0:2:50,77
If he's electronic (into electronics), he would pick up distress in the water. You know, whatever it is.


26
0:2:50,77 --> 0:2:59,59
But I don't find Academia to be critical of a political system. I don't find many opinions coming forth 


27
0:2:59,59 --> 0:3:6,89
on how to modify our system; so that we have less problems. I don't find that.


28
0:3:6,89 --> 0:3:14,5
Now in books on politics, I don't think George Washington would be surprised at the decision-making today.


29
0:3:14,5 --> 0:3:23,78
Cause its not that different. Benjamin Franklin, or anybody else. Our political system is based on opinions,


30
0:3:23,78 --> 0:3:34,12
projections, inadequacies, incompetence. That's why I say "They would feel at home in this society."


31
0:3:34,12 --> 0:3:40,72
But they would not feel at home in a Venus Project. No politician would know how decisions are made.


32
0:3:40,72 --> 0:3:46,48
They wouldn't understand why our schools are the way they are. They wouldn't; even if they came and visited 


33
0:3:46,48 --> 0:3:54,26
the schools. They wouldn't understand. They wouldn't understand the nature of environmental reclamation. 


34
0:3:54,26 --> 0:4:0,74
Why it's done. And they wouldn't understand where you get the money to do environmental reclamations. 


35
0:4:0,74 --> 0:4:6,88
If the earth is declared common heritage, that's the only way you can have access to anything.


36
0:4:6,88 --> 0:4:14,6
I can't understand if you base all your decisions on "How much will it cost?" Well, you wouldn't do anything. 


37
0:4:14,6 --> 0:4:19,98
Cause everything costs a lot of money. Except war. It makes a lot of money.


38
0:4:19,98 --> 0:4:26,41
It isn't that I want to direct the whole thing. I haven't gotten assistance from others on how to put 


39
0:4:26,41 --> 0:4:36,6
up buildings faster. That were that new. So I had to innovate all this shit, cause I didn't get anything from others.


40
0:4:36,6 --> 0:4:43,25
I'm not interested in doing all that. I'd rather have people capable of knowing when they see a ship; 


41
0:4:43,25 --> 0:4:49,18
"What is it you want?" - "You want the whole cargo unloaded at a given place." You don't want to take off 


42
0:4:49,18 --> 0:4:56,84
one container at a time. That's okay, if different containers go different places. And you got one ship.


43
0:4:56,84 --> 0:5:3,82
But in the future, you must design automobile manufacturing at a certain region, so you deliver metals to that region.


44
0:5:3,82 --> 0:5:12,12
Not all over Detroit or wherever you have auto factories. You have automotive production in a given region.


45
0:5:12,12 --> 0:5:18,12
You know what I mean? With production lines. So you deliver more stuff; the same kind of stuff to all 


46
0:5:18,12 --> 0:5:25,99
the auto producers. Cows and farming would be in a region with farming canning factories nearby.


47
0:5:25,99 --> 0:5:32,62
Not 50 miles away. Do you understand what I'm saying? I don't know any other system. I've never heard 


48
0:5:32,62 --> 0:5:39,93
of a food producer that said "I'm going to open a cannery on my grounds so I can can the string beans."


49
0:5:39,93 --> 0:5:48,47
And besides, they wouldn't rot if they did that right away. I've never heard of an undertaker making recommendations


50
0:5:48,47 --> 0:5:57,79
for the use of usable organs before the burial. You know what I mean? A kidney, whatever it is, you can get.


51
0:5:57,79 --> 0:6:1,93
And you don't ask people whether or not they want to give their kidney after they're dead. 


52
0:6:1,93 --> 0:6:6,73
They say "Oh, I wanna be buried whole." The Jews do not permit dissection. 


53
0:6:6,73 --> 0:6:16,1
But the Jews won't ever know what the inside of the body is like if you don't permit dissection.


54
0:6:16,1 --> 0:6:24,22
You know what I mean? But people will die due to their belief systems. But, if you wanna go with that 


55
0:6:24,22 --> 0:6:30,55
belief system. You can go, but I can assure you, you won't live as long as other systems.


56
0:6:30,55 --> 0:6:37,66
And if our system can't make the appropriate decisions, we'll be surpassed by China, or North Korea, 


57
0:6:37,66 --> 0:6:40,86
or some other country that can make those decisions. 


58
0:6:40,86 --> 0:6:47,75
I don't say they will. But we will be surpassed if we can't make the appropriate decision. 


59
0:6:47,75 --> 0:6:55,89
So nature is a final eliminator, not Fresco. I don't eliminate people. If they're insufficiency is 


60
0:6:55,89 --> 0:7:3,41
"Every man for himself." Than that society will run as long as evolution will permit it to run. 


61
0:7:3,41 --> 0:7:10,82
You know, until the system is automated, and they fall on their face. That doesn't mean social change 


62
0:7:10,82 --> 0:7:17,97
won't be made. It means people might die fighting each other. And killing each other. And riots because


63
0:7:17,97 --> 0:7:23,86
of different values; unless there is something put out there that people can understand.


64
0:7:23,86 --> 0:7:31,45
I think I could sell the package if not all the people, a great many people. Enough to influence them.


65
0:7:31,45 --> 0:7:38,26
Because they don't come there as an American to get them to accept our value system as the only one.


66
0:7:38,26 --> 0:7:46,22
And you don't attack their customs. You wait till evolution passes the need for customs of that kind. 


67
0:7:46,22 --> 0:7:51,85
There are a group of Israeli's that are interested in The Venus Project. But if I went to Israel I'd 


68
0:7:51,85 --> 0:7:59,5
be boo'd off a platform. The majority does not believe. Does not lean towards science. You know what I mean?


69
0:7:59,5 --> 0:8:6,1
So, I would try if I were invited, don't misunderstand me. If there were a big enough group in Israel, 


70
0:8:6,1 --> 0:8:11,12
I would go there and talk to that group and tell them how to reach the other group.


71
0:8:11,12 --> 0:8:17,21
If I talk to the other group, I need three days, not a one-hour lecture.


72
0:8:17,21 --> 0:8:23,95
I never came up with ideas because academicians approved it. I came up with them to try to find a


73
0:8:23,95 --> 0:8:31,63
working solution. Academia doesn't know how to stop wars. Academia doesn't know hot to ask "What is the 


74
0:8:31,63 --> 0:8:38,3
bomber for?" They don't seem to do that. That's why I don't respect them. If they understand my direction,


75
0:8:38,3 --> 0:8:42,63
that's more important than being a member of Academia.


76
0:8:42,63 --> 0:8:48,29
And people would say to me, are there any great people that accepted The Venus Project?


77
0:8:48,29 --> 0:8:53,55
There's something the matter with them; they have a low self-sufficiency. If the great man says "It's 


78
0:8:53,55 --> 0:8:59,92
a good idea. They'll follow it." I don't want that kind of shit. Do you understand?


79
0:8:59,92 --> 0:9:6,99
If you say "Are there any famous people that accept The Venus Project?" Not that I know of.


80
0:9:6,99 --> 0:9:12,2
Because you would then go on if Einstein said it was okay. What about you?


81
0:9:12,2 --> 0:9:13,13
Roxanne: "Bill Gates..."


82
0:9:13,13 --> 0:9:18,46
If you understand what I'm talking about, you say its okay, even thought the world doesn't agree with you.


83
0:9:18,46 --> 0:9:25,47
The guys in the old days that believed the earth was round must have had a very rough time with Academia.


84
0:9:25,47 --> 0:9:32,79
I think it was Academia that burnt them. It's Academia today that can cut you off. That can say "That man's 


85
0:9:32,79 --> 0:9:40,57
completely unqualified, never went to MIT, has no record of achievement in this world." - All true!


86
0:9:40,57 --> 0:9:47,2
But that doesn't mean anything. What means something is if people understand that if you don't take care


87
0:9:47,2 --> 0:9:55,66
of the environment, you lose it. That isn't difficult. But it may be "I guess the experts know what they're doing.


88
0:9:55,66 --> 0:10:1,34
Let's leave it to politicians. At least they know what they're doing." I don't believe they even know what


89
0:10:1,34 --> 0:10:8,48
they're doing. I don't believe they have the slightest idea what they're doing. I believe they're academicians


90
0:10:8,48 --> 0:10:11,43
that believe one opinion is as good as another.
