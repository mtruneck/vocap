1
0:0:2,48 --> 0:0:2,48
0:00:02.000,0:00:05.066


2
0:0:2,48 --> 0:0:2,56
Tonight, more than 200 years after a former


3
0:0:2,56 --> 0:0:6,5
colony won the right to determine its own


4
0:0:6,5 --> 0:0:6,529
destiny.


5
0:0:6,529 --> 0:0:6,56
0:00:05.066,0:00:13.066


6
0:0:6,56 --> 0:0:8,549
Tonight, more than 200 years after a former


7
0:0:8,549 --> 0:0:11,639
colony won the right to determine its own


8
0:0:11,639 --> 0:0:12,43
destiny.


9
0:0:12,43 --> 0:0:13,24
0:00:13.066,0:00:18.000


10
0:0:13,24 --> 0:0:17,57
The task of perfecting our union moves


11
0:0:17,57 --> 0:0:21,259
forward.


12
0:0:21,259 --> 0:0:24,96
0:00:24.066,0:00:28.033


13
0:0:24,96 --> 0:0:27,839
It moves forward because of you.


14
0:0:27,839 --> 0:0:28,99
0:00:29.000,0:00:38.033


15
0:0:28,99 --> 0:0:32,99
It moves forward because you reaffirmed the


16
0:0:32,99 --> 0:0:36,969
spirit that has triumphed over war and


17
0:0:36,969 --> 0:0:37,73
depression,


18
0:0:37,73 --> 0:0:38,489
0:00:38.033,0:00:43.000


19
0:0:38,489 --> 0:0:40,649
the spirit that has lifted this country from
the


20
0:0:40,649 --> 0:0:42,85
depths of despair to the great heights of


21
0:0:42,85 --> 0:0:44,149
hope,


22
0:0:44,149 --> 0:0:45,46
0:00:44.066,0:00:49.066


23
0:0:45,46 --> 0:0:48,19
the belief that while each of us will pursue


24
0:0:48,19 --> 0:0:49,96
our own individual dreams,


25
0:0:49,96 --> 0:0:50,66
0:00:49.066,0:00:56.033


26
0:0:50,66 --> 0:0:53,84
we are an American family and we rise or fall


27
0:0:53,84 --> 0:1:3,53
together as one nation and as one people.


28
0:1:3,53 --> 0:1:5,5
0:01:06.066,0:01:12.000


29
0:1:5,5 --> 0:1:11,51
Tonight, in this election, you, the American


30
0:1:11,51 --> 0:1:12,46
people,


31
0:1:12,46 --> 0:1:13,4
0:01:13.000,0:01:16.066


32
0:1:13,4 --> 0:1:15,9
reminded us that while our road has been


33
0:1:15,9 --> 0:1:16,97
hard,


34
0:1:16,97 --> 0:1:18,4
0:01:17.000,0:01:20.033


35
0:1:18,4 --> 0:1:19,88
while our journey has been long


36
0:1:19,88 --> 0:1:20,22
0:01:20.033,0:01:22.066


37
0:1:20,22 --> 0:1:22,3
we have picked ourselves up,


38
0:1:22,3 --> 0:1:22,62
0:01:22.066,0:01:24.000


39
0:1:22,62 --> 0:1:24,45
we have fought our way back,


40
0:1:24,45 --> 0:1:24,85
0:01:24.066,0:01:31.033


41
0:1:24,85 --> 0:1:28,61
and we know in our hearts that for the United


42
0:1:28,61 --> 0:1:36,36
States of America the best is yet to come.


43
0:1:36,36 --> 0:1:41,75
0:01:41.066,0:01:45.066


44
0:1:41,75 --> 0:1:43,45
I want to thank every American who


45
0:1:43,45 --> 0:1:48,15
participated in this election,


46
0:1:48,15 --> 0:1:51,42
0:01:51.066,0:01:59.033


47
0:1:51,42 --> 0:1:55,65
whether you voted for the very first time
or


48
0:1:55,65 --> 0:2:1,81
waited in line for a very long time.


49
0:2:1,81 --> 0:2:4,25
0:02:04.000,0:02:08.000


50
0:2:4,25 --> 0:2:9,11
By the way, we have to fix that.


51
0:2:9,11 --> 0:2:12,989
0:02:12.033,0:02:16.033


52
0:2:12,989 --> 0:2:14,599
Whether you pounded the pavement or


53
0:2:14,599 --> 0:2:19,84
picked up the phone,


54
0:2:19,84 --> 0:2:22,189
0:02:21.066,0:02:29.000


55
0:2:22,189 --> 0:2:24,209
whether you held an Obama sign or a


56
0:2:24,209 --> 0:2:27,909
Romney sign, you made your voice heard


57
0:2:27,909 --> 0:2:29,93
and you made a difference.


58
0:2:29,93 --> 0:2:31,39
0:02:32.000,0:02:38.000


59
0:2:31,39 --> 0:2:35,99
I just spoke with Gov. Romney and I


60
0:2:35,99 --> 0:2:37,4
congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard-


61
0:2:37,4 --> 0:2:42,2
fought campaign.


62
0:2:42,2 --> 0:2:46,2
0:02:45.033,0:02:54.000


63
0:2:46,2 --> 0:2:48,579
We may have battled fiercely, but it's only


64
0:2:48,579 --> 0:2:51,78
because we love this country deeply and we


65
0:2:51,78 --> 0:2:54,59
care so strongly about its future.


66
0:2:54,59 --> 0:2:55,829
0:02:55.033,0:03:08.033


67
0:2:55,829 --> 0:2:59,709
From George to Lenore to their son Mitt, the


68
0:2:59,709 --> 0:3:2,28
Romney family has chosen to give back to


69
0:3:2,28 --> 0:3:5,2
America through public service and that is


70
0:3:5,2 --> 0:3:7,499
the legacy that we honor and applaud


71
0:3:7,499 --> 0:3:10,609
tonight.


72
0:3:10,609 --> 0:3:13,719
0:03:16.066,0:03:23.033


73
0:3:13,719 --> 0:3:18,78
In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to


74
0:3:18,78 --> 0:3:21,379
sitting down with Gov. Romney to talk about


75
0:3:21,379 --> 0:3:22,79
where we can work together to move this


76
0:3:22,79 --> 0:3:26,359
country forward.


77
0:3:26,359 --> 0:3:29,359
0:03:29.066,0:03:42.000


78
0:3:29,359 --> 0:3:32,639
I want to thank my friend and partner of the


79
0:3:32,639 --> 0:3:35,969
last four years, America's happy warrior,
the


80
0:3:35,969 --> 0:3:36,68
best vice president anybody could ever hope


81
0:3:36,68 --> 0:3:36,989
for, Joe Biden.


82
0:3:36,989 --> 0:3:37,9
0:03:55.033,0:03:58.033


83
0:3:37,9 --> 0:3:57,459
And I wouldn't be the man I am today


84
0:3:57,459 --> 0:3:59,139
0:03:59.033,0:04:03.033


85
0:3:59,139 --> 0:4:0,919
without the woman who agreed to marry me


86
0:4:0,919 --> 0:4:3,739
20 years ago.


87
0:4:3,739 --> 0:4:6,49
0:04:10.000,0:04:20.033


88
0:4:6,49 --> 0:4:13,279
Let me say this publicly: Michelle, I have


89
0:4:13,279 --> 0:4:16,81
never loved you more. I have never been


90
0:4:16,81 --> 0:4:20,53
prouder to watch the rest of America fall
in


91
0:4:20,53 --> 0:4:20,53
0:04:20.033,0:04:24.033


92
0:4:20,53 --> 0:4:30,1
love with you, too, as our nation's first
lady.


93
0:4:30,1 --> 0:4:32,7
0:04:32.066,0:04:35.000


94
0:4:32,7 --> 0:4:34,22
Sasha and Malia,


95
0:4:34,22 --> 0:4:35,3
0:04:35.066,0:04:44.000


96
0:4:35,3 --> 0:4:39,59
before our very eyes you're growing up to


97
0:4:39,59 --> 0:4:42,67
become two strong, smart beautiful young


98
0:4:42,67 --> 0:4:45,13
women, just like your mom.


99
0:4:45,13 --> 0:4:46,51
0:04:48.066,0:04:55.000


100
0:4:46,51 --> 0:4:52,72
And I'm so proud of you guys. But I will
say


101
0:4:52,72 --> 0:4:59,33
that for now one dog's probably enough.


102
0:4:59,33 --> 0:5:1,1
0:05:00.000,0:05:07.066


103
0:5:1,1 --> 0:5:5,52
To the best campaign team and volunteers in


104
0:5:5,52 --> 0:5:12,16
the history of politics.


105
0:5:12,16 --> 0:5:13,82
0:05:14.066,0:05:16.000


106
0:5:13,82 --> 0:5:17,14
The best.


107
0:5:17,14 --> 0:5:18,8
0:05:19.000,0:05:21.000


108
0:5:18,8 --> 0:5:23,78
The best ever.


109
0:5:23,78 --> 0:5:25,44
0:05:29.000,0:05:35.033


110
0:5:25,44 --> 0:5:31,77
Some of you were new this time around, and


111
0:5:31,77 --> 0:5:34,7
some of you have been at my side since the


112
0:5:34,7 --> 0:5:34,74
very beginning


113
0:5:34,74 --> 0:5:38,27
0:05:37.066,0:05:39.000


114
0:5:38,27 --> 0:5:40,64
But all of you are family.


115
0:5:40,64 --> 0:5:41,27
0:05:41.033,0:05:51.000


116
0:5:41,27 --> 0:5:43,68
No matter what you do or where you go from


117
0:5:43,68 --> 0:5:47,51
here, you will carry the memory of the history


118
0:5:47,51 --> 0:5:51,52
we made together and you will have the


119
0:5:51,52 --> 0:5:51,52
0:05:51.000,0:05:54.066


120
0:5:51,52 --> 0:5:54,32
lifelong appreciation of a grateful president.


121
0:5:54,32 --> 0:5:55,3
0:05:55.033,0:06:02.000


122
0:5:55,3 --> 0:5:59,33
Thank you for believing all the way, through


123
0:5:59,33 --> 0:6:3,46
every hill, through every valley.


124
0:6:3,46 --> 0:6:4,28
0:06:04.000,0:06:13.033


125
0:6:4,28 --> 0:6:11,31
You lifted me up the whole way and I will


126
0:6:11,31 --> 0:6:19,24
always be grateful for everything that you've


127
0:6:19,24 --> 0:6:21,51
done and


128
0:6:21,51 --> 0:6:22,64
0:06:13.033,0:06:17.033


129
0:6:22,64 --> 0:6:24,6
all the incredible work that you put in.


130
0:6:24,6 --> 0:6:24,1
0:06:22.000,0:06:29.033


131
0:6:24,1 --> 0:6:25,96
I know that political campaigns can


132
0:6:25,96 --> 0:6:30,5
sometimes seem small, even silly.


133
0:6:30,5 --> 0:6:31,41
0:06:30.033,0:06:36.000


134
0:6:31,41 --> 0:6:33,66
And that provides plenty of fodder for the


135
0:6:33,66 --> 0:6:37,1
cynics that tell us that politics is nothing
more


136
0:6:37,1 --> 0:6:37,35
than


137
0:6:37,35 --> 0:6:37,35
0:06:36.000,0:06:42.066


138
0:6:37,35 --> 0:6:40,97
a contest of egos or the domain of special


139
0:6:40,97 --> 0:6:42,14
interests.


140
0:6:42,14 --> 0:6:43,31
0:06:43.066,0:06:49.033


141
0:6:43,31 --> 0:6:46,4
But if you ever get the chance to talk to
folks


142
0:6:46,4 --> 0:6:48,99
who turned out at our rallies


143
0:6:48,99 --> 0:6:49,14
0:06:49.033,0:06:53.033


144
0:6:49,14 --> 0:6:51,42
and crowded along a rope line in a high


145
0:6:51,42 --> 0:6:53,21
school gym,


146
0:6:53,21 --> 0:6:54,56
0:06:53.066,0:07:03.000


147
0:6:54,56 --> 0:6:56,86
or saw folks working late in a campaign


148
0:6:56,86 --> 0:6:59,77
office in some tiny county far away from


149
0:6:59,77 --> 0:7:3,56
home, you'll discover something else.


150
0:7:3,56 --> 0:7:4,56
0:07:05.033,0:07:11.000


151
0:7:4,56 --> 0:7:8,17
You'll hear the determination in the voice
of a


152
0:7:8,17 --> 0:7:10,4
young field organizer who's working his
way


153
0:7:10,4 --> 0:7:11,5
through college


154
0:7:11,5 --> 0:7:11,44
0:07:11.066,0:07:15.066


155
0:7:11,44 --> 0:7:13,42
and wants to make sure every child has that


156
0:7:13,42 --> 0:7:16,12
same opportunity.


157
0:7:16,12 --> 0:7:18,47
0:07:20.033,0:07:24.033


158
0:7:18,47 --> 0:7:23,46
You'll hear the pride in the voice of a


159
0:7:23,46 --> 0:7:24,56
volunteer who's going door to door


160
0:7:24,56 --> 0:7:24,56
0:07:24.033,0:07:28.033


161
0:7:24,56 --> 0:7:26,87
because her brother was finally hired when


162
0:7:26,87 --> 0:7:30,87
the local auto plant added another shift.


163
0:7:30,87 --> 0:7:32,83
0:07:34.000,0:07:39.033


164
0:7:32,83 --> 0:7:38,9
You'll hear the deep patriotism in the voice
of


165
0:7:38,9 --> 0:7:39,96
a military spouse


166
0:7:39,96 --> 0:7:40,34
0:07:40.033,0:07:44.066


167
0:7:40,34 --> 0:7:42,27
who's working the phones late at night to


168
0:7:42,27 --> 0:7:44,11
make sure that no one who fights for this


169
0:7:44,11 --> 0:7:44,53
country


170
0:7:44,53 --> 0:7:45,29
0:07:45.066,0:07:49.066


171
0:7:45,29 --> 0:7:52,17
ever has to fight for a job or a roof over
their


172
0:7:52,17 --> 0:7:57,19
head when they come home.


173
0:7:57,19 --> 0:7:58,19
0:07:58.033,0:08:00.066


174
0:7:58,19 --> 0:8:0,58
That's why we do this.


175
0:8:0,58 --> 0:8:1,42
0:08:01.066,0:08:05.066


176
0:8:1,42 --> 0:8:4,27
That's what politics can be.


177
0:8:4,27 --> 0:8:5,44
0:08:06.066,0:08:08.033


178
0:8:5,44 --> 0:8:8,7
That's why elections matter.


179
0:8:8,7 --> 0:8:8,86
0:08:09.066,0:08:12.000


180
0:8:8,86 --> 0:8:12,8
It's not small, it's big.


181
0:8:12,8 --> 0:8:13,59
0:08:13.000,0:08:14.000


182
0:8:13,59 --> 0:8:15,17
It's important.


183
0:8:15,17 --> 0:8:15,96
0:08:15.000,0:08:22.000


184
0:8:15,96 --> 0:8:19,63
Democracy in a nation of 300 million can be


185
0:8:19,63 --> 0:8:22,93
noisy and messy and complicated.


186
0:8:22,93 --> 0:8:24,49
0:08:24.033,0:08:25.033


187
0:8:24,49 --> 0:8:26,43
We have our own opinions.


188
0:8:26,43 --> 0:8:26,85
0:08:26.033,0:08:28.066


189
0:8:26,85 --> 0:8:29,65
Each of us has deeply held beliefs.


190
0:8:29,65 --> 0:8:30,95
0:08:30.000,0:08:40.000


191
0:8:30,95 --> 0:8:33,82
And when we go through tough times, when


192
0:8:33,82 --> 0:8:37,219
we make big decisions as a country, it


193
0:8:37,219 --> 0:8:39,319
necessarily stirs passions,


194
0:8:39,319 --> 0:8:40,129
0:08:40.000,0:08:41.033


195
0:8:40,129 --> 0:8:41,899
stirs up controversy.


196
0:8:41,899 --> 0:8:43,289
0:08:43.066,0:08:47.066


197
0:8:43,289 --> 0:8:45,92
That won't change after tonight, and it


198
0:8:45,92 --> 0:8:47,339
shouldn't.


199
0:8:47,339 --> 0:8:48,759
0:08:48.000,0:08:52.000


200
0:8:48,759 --> 0:8:51,55
These arguments we have are a mark of our


201
0:8:51,55 --> 0:8:52,85
liberty.


202
0:8:52,85 --> 0:8:54,149
0:08:53.066,0:09:00.033


203
0:8:54,149 --> 0:8:56,999
We can never forget that as we speak


204
0:8:56,999 --> 0:8:59,889
people in distant nations are risking their
lives


205
0:8:59,889 --> 0:9:0,47
right now


206
0:9:0,47 --> 0:9:0,47
0:09:00.033,0:09:04.066


207
0:9:0,47 --> 0:9:4,4
just for a chance to argue about the issues


208
0:9:4,4 --> 0:9:4,779
that matter,


209
0:9:4,779 --> 0:9:5,16
0:09:05.000,0:09:09.000


210
0:9:5,16 --> 0:9:12,16
the chance to cast their ballots like we did


211
0:9:12,16 --> 0:9:14,579
today.


212
0:9:14,579 --> 0:9:16,999
0:09:16.033,0:09:24.000


213
0:9:16,999 --> 0:9:22,629
But despite all our differences, most of us


214
0:9:22,629 --> 0:9:26,69
share certain hopes for America's future.


215
0:9:26,69 --> 0:9:26,959
0:09:26.000,0:09:32.000


216
0:9:26,959 --> 0:9:28,49
We want our kids to grow up in a country


217
0:9:28,49 --> 0:9:30,86
where they have access to the best schools


218
0:9:30,86 --> 0:9:32,41
and the best teachers.


219
0:9:32,41 --> 0:9:33,3
0:09:35.033,0:09:40.000


220
0:9:33,3 --> 0:9:37,36
A country that lives up to its legacy as the


221
0:9:37,36 --> 0:9:39,61
global leader in technology and discovery


222
0:9:39,61 --> 0:9:40,379
and innovation,


223
0:9:40,379 --> 0:9:40,949
0:09:40.066,0:09:44.066


224
0:9:40,949 --> 0:9:42,779
with all the good jobs and new businesses


225
0:9:42,779 --> 0:9:44,87
that follow.


226
0:9:44,87 --> 0:9:46,329
0:09:46.000,0:09:50.000


227
0:9:46,329 --> 0:9:48,129
We want our children to live in an America


228
0:9:48,129 --> 0:9:49,62
that isn't burdened by debt,


229
0:9:49,62 --> 0:9:50,89
0:09:50.000,0:09:52.033


230
0:9:50,89 --> 0:9:52,339
that isn't weakened by inequality,


231
0:9:52,339 --> 0:9:52,91
0:09:53.033,0:09:57.033


232
0:9:52,91 --> 0:9:55,93
that isn't threatened by the destructive
power


233
0:9:55,93 --> 0:11:55,93
of a warming planet.
