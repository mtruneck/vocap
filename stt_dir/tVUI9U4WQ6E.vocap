###3 MALE SPEAKER: Thanks for being here everybody.
###5 We're very lucky today to have David Kilcullen as our guest.
###9 And by the way, before I forget, I
###11 want to give a special shout out to the men
###13 of the 23rd marine regiment who are here as our guests.
###17 Thank you for your service.
###19 David Kilcullen is a counter insurgency expert.
###23 He first, at least, came to my attention
###26 as part of the surge in Iraq in 2007,
###29 but his resume goes much deeper than that.
###32 Today, he's going to talk about what he's doing nowadays,
###35 which involves some work with Google, actually, on Syria.
###41 He's been adviser to General David Petraeus and Condoleezza
###44 Rice and is now operating a consulting service in Virginia
###49 where he deals with all sorts of interesting stuff, which
###51 he'll be happy to tell you about.
###53 So please give a warm welcome to David Kilcullen.
###55 
###58 DAVID KILCULLEN: Thank you.
###59 It's actually great to be here on such a beautiful day in San
###62 Francisco.
###62 I was talking to a guy last night.
###64 He said the problem with San Francisco is it makes you lazy.
###67 I was like, what do you mean?
###68 He was like well, yesterday I woke up,
###70 and I had all this work to do, but then I thought,
###72 I think I'm just going to go for a hike with my wife.
###74 And I blew off the whole-- and I'm like,
###76 I can totally see that.
###77 Every time I get off the plane in California,
###79 I'm like, why don't we live here again?
###82 So thank you for spending an hour of a beautiful day inside
###85 with me when you could be out doing a bunch of other stuff.
###89 Obviously, I just wrote this book, which is why I'm here.
###91 But I thought what I would do is just hit up
###94 some of the main ideas in the book
###96 rather than try to give you a full download,
###99 and then maybe in Q&A we can kick those around, and discuss
###103 some of the main stuff that comes out of it,
###106 and see what you guys are most interested in talking about.
###110 I began writing the book in September of 2009
###114 after getting ambushed in Afghanistan.
###116 It's not the first, or in fact, the last time that I've been
###119 ambushed in Afghanistan, but this particular one
###121 was interesting.
###122 It was the classic late afternoon ambush scenario
###126 that you get in Afghanistan, because most of Eastern
###128 Afghanistan has a very, very narrow set of valleys that
###132 have settlement patterns of-- basically people live
###135 in the bottom of the valleys.
###137 Nobody lives on the mountains themselves,
###139 and there's usually only one road running down
###142 the middle of each valley.
###143 So if you go up that valley in the morning,
###145 essentially everyone in that whole community
###146 knows exactly where you're going to be at 4 o'clock
###149 in the afternoon.
###149 You're going to be driving down the valley.
###151 And in fact, Afghan families have ambush spots
###156 like families in the Chesapeake Bay
###159 have fishing spots or families out here.
###161 They don't have to go through the full complex planning
###164 process that an infantry small unit does
###166 when it decides to do an ambush.
###168 They basically say hey, Abdul.
###169 Get to the ambush spot.
###170 Because they have three or four of them already picked out.
###173 In fact, I was in another ambush earlier in my career
###177 in Afghanistan where we actually found old 303 ammunition
###181 from British rifles that went out
###182 of service in the 19th century up in these firing positions
###186 on either side of the road, so they'd obviously
###188 been using this ambush site for some considerable time.
###192 But I'm in the middle of this ambush, and I think to myself,
###195 this is a pretty bad ambush.
###197 I've become a bit of an involuntary connoisseur
###200 over the years, and I actually used
###202 to teach ambushing at the tactics school
###204 when I was captain.
###206 So I'm like, if these were my students on the battle course,
###208 I would have failed them for their ambush plan.
###210 It was just very badly put together.
###212 It didn't come-- it just didn't work.
###215 Anyway, we get to the bottom of the valley,
###217 and I'm talking to my driver of my Amrep, which
###220 is like a big armored garbage truck
###222 that we drive around in Afghanistan.
###225 And the driver says to gunner, hey,
###228 how many Taliban guys do you reckon we killed?
###230 And I was like, well, how do you know they were Taliban?
###232 And they were like, dude, they were shooting at us.
###235 And it took me a little while.
###236 I was actually on the helicopter ride back afterwards.
###239 But I began to think maybe this attack had actually nothing
###242 to do with the Taliban.
###243 And when I started to think about what we've
###245 been doing in that valley for the preceding two or three
###247 years, and the way that we laid down a series of projects
###251 to help the community, and how that had actually dis-empowered
###255 other people in the community and created
###257 a big imbalance of resources going into some villages
###260 and into others, I started to realize that actually there's
###263 a lot more that meets the eye in a place like Eastern
###267 Afghanistan around stuff like contracting,
###270 and around denial of access to services,
###274 and the way that people interact with this giant tsunami
###278 of contracting and aid money that comes into Afghanistan.
###282 About 14 times the size of the total Afghan government budget
###286 is our aid programming in Afghanistan.
###289 And I began to write this book, trying
###292 to think beyond the paradigm of counter insurgency,
###296 and for those people that are in the military, that's
###299 like anathema.
###300 Like, what?
###300 Dave Kilcullen?
###301 Didn't you write a book on counter insurgency?
###303 Yes, but it's just a book, and we have this paradigm
###308 that we built, because it helped us to win a conflict in Iraq,
###313 and it helped us to win a variety
###315 of smaller fights in other places.
###317 But that doesn't mean that it's dogma,
###319 and that's the answer forever.
###320 Like any other human model or mental picture
###324 of an environment, all it is is a systematic oversimplification
###328 of very complex reality.
###330 And over time, when you start to see
###332 data that don't fit with your model,
###335 it's time to update the model.
###337 And so what I've been doing over the past three or four years
###340 is thinking beyond that and actually
###342 reaching back into some work that I previously
###345 did when I was in the Australian military looking
###347 at urbanized environments, and I'm
###350 going to talk about that a lot in a minute,
###352 but I just want to set the context.
###354 Ever since 9/11, the military in particular, but also
###358 aid agencies, diplomatic services,
###360 a variety of other organizations have
###363 gotten really good at the kind of stuff
###365 that I was doing in Eastern Afghanistan when
###368 I got shot up in 2009.
###370 Remote environments, tribal communities,
###374 landlocked countries like Afghanistan,
###376 the work that we do in little remote frontier outposts
###381 has become, I think, dramatically better quality
###385 than it was a decade ago.
###387 But if you look at the environment
###388 that we've been operating in, its very specific.
###391 Afghanistan's a very diffuse conflict.
###393 The conflict mostly happens in rural environments,
###396 not in the cities.
###397 It happens in this land locked, mountainous arid, not
###401 very heavily populated environment.
###404 And most importantly, it's a very low bandwidth,
###407 low conductivity environment.
###409 Most people don't have the ability
###411 to tap into an extensive cellphone network, or access
###415 to the internet, or any of the sorts of things
###417 that we take for granted in the modern urban world.
###422 So as I was researching the book,
###424 I started to think to myself, what's
###426 going to happen after Afghanistan?
###428 Now, it's become fashionable in the politics world
###431 and the foreign policy discussions
###433 in Washington to act like the war in Afghanistan
###435 is already over, like we don't currently
###438 have all these troops out there fighting and dying
###440 on the ground, or diplomats doing the work they're doing,
###443 or aid agencies or other people doing
###445 the hard work in Afghanistan, like that's all finished.
###448 Actually, our friends are still out there doing
###451 this stuff on the ground, and I think
###453 it's really important to not forget that.
###455 That said, it's pretty clear that the conflict
###457 is going to start winding down in the next year or two,
###461 and it's worth asking yourself what
###463 does the future environment look like?
###464 Does it look like Afghanistan, or does it
###466 look like something else?
###468 And a lot of the book is my exploration of that question.
###474 When I look at the future environment, what I see
###477 is a very high degree of what you
###479 might call operational continuity.
###482 The stuff that we do, we will keep
###484 on doing mostly that kind of stuff
###487 in the future environment.
###488 As an example of that, if you go back in US military history
###492 to about the middle of the 19th century around the time
###494 of the Mexican War, and you start a timeline then,
###497 and you run it forward to now, you
###499 find a really, really consistent pattern in US military history
###503 where we do a large scale or long duration irregular warfare
###508 campaign about once every 20 to 25 years,
###511 and we do small ones on a scale of Kosovo, or East Timor,
###515 or Sierra Leone about once every 5 to 10 years in between.
###519 And that patent is not only very consistent
###522 and appears to be totally unaffected by policymakers'
###525 preferences.
###526 So beginning of last year, President Obama
###529 gave direction to the US military
###531 where he said we're going to get out
###532 of the business of doing large scale, long duration
###535 stabilization operations or counter insurgencies.
###538 He said we're not going to structure the force for that
###540 anymore.
###541 Turns out President Clinton said basically the same thing
###544 in 1992.
###546 Candidate George W. Bush said the same thing in 2000.
###549 President Johnson said the same thing in 1964.
###552 You can run this back, and you'll
###553 find about seven presidents in the 20th century alone making
###557 basically the same comment, and it
###559 has zero effect on how often we get
###561 into these kinds of conflicts.
###564 Across the planet since the end of the Napoleonic Wars,
###567 roughly 80% of all conflict has been intrastate--
###572 that is within communities, within one country-- or it's
###575 involved a non-state armed group like pirates, or insurgents,
###579 or some other kind of combatant that is not a nation state.
###585 So that is in fact-- that's the typical environment that we
###589 operate or the stereotypical type of work that we do.
###592 But the environment that we've operated in the past
###595 is not the environment that we're going to look at.
###598 So operational continuity but a strong environmental
###602 discontinuity between what's coming
###605 and what we've been doing in the last decade,
###607 this landlocked remote rural environment.
###611 Now, American forces, particularly the army
###614 and the Marine Corps were very heavily involved
###617 in urban fighting in Iraq.
###619 So talking to an American audience,
###621 it's easy to think that actually we have a lot of experience
###623 globally in urban operations.
###626 That's actually not true.
###627 There were 50 countries in Iraq, 51 in Afghanistan,
###631 but only one of those that it was involved
###633 in any significant urban fighting
###635 was the American military in Baghdad.
###637 When I deployed to Baghdad in-- I'm
###639 sorry-- and Ramadi and all the other areas
###642 around that in the American sector.
###643 When I deployed to Baghdad in February of 2007, at that time,
###647 more than 50% of total combat action in the war in Iraq
###652 was happening inside Baghdad city limits,
###654 which is a purely US theater.
###656 Everybody else engaged in the conflict
###659 was out in more remote rural environments,
###661 where frankly there was a lot less violence going on.
###664 So for most of the 50 countries that we're in Iraq,
###667 normal is not urban.
###669 Normal is farms, little villages, rural districts,
###673 not a lot of fighting, more like peacekeeping and stabilization.
###677 And for everybody that went to Afghanistan,
###680 you're dealing with this rural diffuse environment.
###683 But looking forward, I see four big trends
###687 that are actually changing the environment
###690 and will shape how we operate or where we operate in the future,
###694 and those trends are population, urbanization, littoralization--
###698 which is just the tendency for things to cluster
###701 on coastlines-- and then most importantly electronic
###707 network connectivity.
###708 Now, those first three trends are old.
###711 They've been around for at least 200 years since the beginning
###714 of the European Industrial Revolution.
###716 They're also very well understood
###718 in the military in particular.
###719 Let me just talk about them briefly before I
###721 go to what I think is the more important one,
###723 which is connectivity.
###724 So, population growth, at the beginning of the US Industrial
###729 Revolution in 17-- sorry, the European Industrial
###731 Revolution in 1750, the total population of the planet
###735 was about 750 million people.
###738 It took 150 years for that population
###740 to double through the first century
###742 and a half of industrialization and the invention of things
###746 like new ways to think about irrigation, new ways
###749 to think about crops, concentration of population
###752 in urban environments, improvements in public health.
###755 All those sorts of things led to this population growth process
###759 that began in the middle of the 18th century.
###762 By 1900, we were at 1.5 billion people,
###764 so we doubled the population of the planet in about 150 years.
###769 We then doubled that population again in only 60 years by 1960,
###777 so we get to 3 billion people on the planet in 1960.
###780 And it's worth noting that that second doubling happened
###783 during the same time frame as both world wars
###786 and a major influenza pandemic across the entire planet, which
###791 between them killed about 150 million, mainly
###794 young and healthy people.
###796 So despite that, we saw this doubling by 1960 to 3 billion.
###800 The population then doubled again by the year 2000
###803 to 6 billion, and in just the dozen years since then,
###806 we've added slightly more than a billion people.
###808 So today, were looking at around about 7 billion people
###811 on the planet.
###812 Projecting that forward is not a matter of simple prediction,
###816 it's a matter of looking at the demographic bell curve,
###818 and where people are right now, and where the population growth
###822 is likely to take us.
###824 But the Bureau of Economic and Social Affairs at the UN
###827 and a bunch of other organizations
###828 that look at the stuff project that by the middle
###831 of the century we're looking at something
###833 like 9.5 billion people on the planet,
###836 so about another 2.5 billion people between now and 2050.
###841 There is a projection that the population's
###843 going to top out at around that level
###845 and stay at essentially 9.5 billion by 2050.
###849 That's based on certain assumptions
###851 about what happens to birth rate when GDP increases,
###855 and they may not actually play out.
###856 So we're looking at least 2 1/2 billion more people
###859 on the planet in our generation.
###863 The second factor, though, is urbanization.
###865 So if you go back again to the beginning of the Industrial
###867 Revolution and you think about the population
###869 of the planet at that time, roughly 2%
###872 of people on the earth in 1800 lived
###875 in a city of a million or more.
###877 By 1900, it was 10%.
###880 By 1960, it was 25%.
###882 By April of 2008, it was 50%.
###885 We're currently sitting somewhere north
###887 of 50% urbanization on the planet,
###889 so roughly half the people on the planet
###892 live in a city of a million or more.
###895 Again, the same projections suggest that by 2050 we'll
###899 be looking at somewhere between 65% and 75% urbanization.
###903 So somewhere around the current population of the planet--
###907 7 billion people-- will be living in a large city
###911 by the middle of the century.
###913 Interestingly, that urbanization process
###916 is not only going to account for all the gross population
###920 growth on the planet.
###921 It's also going to account for a lot of people
###923 leaving rural environments and moving
###925 to the cities between now and the middle of the century.
###928 So actually the urban environment
###930 is going to grow by roughly 3 billion people between now
###933 and the middle of the century.
###935 Roughly 1 1/2 million people per week migrate from a country
###938 area to a city, so roughly the same number of people that it
###943 took all of human history until 1960 to generate across
###947 the entire planet are going to move to cities within the next
###951 30 years.
###952 Edgar Peters, who's the head of the Africa City
###954 Center in Cape Town in South Africa,
###956 says we're looking at dramatic disruptive change in just one
###960 generation because of that urbanization and population
###963 growth.
###966 That's not all, though.
###968 Those urban environments will not
###970 be evenly distributed across the surface of the earth.
###972 They'll be almost entirely in the developing world
###975 in low and middle income countries.
###977 This is not a phenomenon that we see
###979 in Europe and the United States.
###981 It's a phenomenon of sub-Saharan Africa, that Mediterranean
###984 basin, South Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.
###987 It's not evenly distributed.
###989 It's developing world cities.
###992 And those cities are overwhelmingly
###995 located on coastlines for reasons of basic physics.
###999 When you want to move heavy large stuff around,
###1003 for all of you in history and still now,
###1005 it's been a hell of a lot easier to move that around by water
###1008 than on land.
###1009 So cities have tended to cluster against large bodies of water
###1013 on rivers, on major river deltas, lakes,
###1016 or on coastlines.
###1017 Already today, 80% of people on the planet
###1020 live within 50 miles of the sea.
###1022 And of course, we're dealing with what systems theorists
###1025 would call sensitivity to initial conditions here.
###1027 So as urbanization takes place, it's
###1030 not happening against the background
###1031 of an evenly distributed human population.
###1035 Cities are already on coastlines,
###1037 so as people move to existing cities,
###1039 they're going to be moving to coastlines.
###1041 So we're going to see a population that's
###1044 incredibly clustered in urban environments in third world
###1048 cities on coastlines.
###1049 
###1052 Obviously, that changes the environment
###1054 in which we operate, but actually the military well
###1056 understood this stuff 25 years ago.
###1057 So a marine general called Krulak
###1059 wrote about a thing called a three block war in the 1990s,
###1063 and he had guys like Ralph Peters and Robert Scales--
###1065 and these are all military theorists
###1067 that I'm mentioning-- who really focused on the problems of what
###1070 we call the urban littoral back in the 1990s.
###1074 And I read some stuff on this.
###1075 It was pretty well understood in the community at that point.
###1078 But what's happened is the military
###1080 since 9/11 has been dragged off into this other environment.
###1084 Now, I wouldn't call Afghanistan a geographical fluke.
###1087 There are deserts, and mountains, and jungles
###1090 where conflict is going to occur in the future,
###1093 but because conflict tends to happen where
###1095 people live and the general parameters
###1098 of human civilization shape the parameters within which
###1100 conflict happens, the majority of conflict on the planet,
###1104 like the majority of everything on the planet,
###1106 is going to happen in third world
###1108 coastal cities by the middle of the century.
###1111 And I can talk more in detail in the Q&A
###1113 if you like about the data that supports that.
###1116 But what's really interesting to me is not these old trends.
###1118 They've been around for a long time,
###1119 and they're well understood.
###1120 What's interesting is the new trend, which is connectivity.
###1123 Now, I'm talking to a bunch of people at Google,
###1125 so I probably don't need to go into the level of detail
###1128 on this that I have with some of the other folks
###1130 that I've spoken to, but just a couple of data points.
###1133 In the year 2000, there were 30,000 cellphones in Nigeria.
###1138 Today, there are 113 million.
###1141 Last year, I spent some time walking around Mogadishu
###1144 engaging with the community there
###1146 on some work we were doing, and Mogadishu
###1149 is a city that survived for 20 years
###1153 without a government or a central state.
###1155 24% of people that live in Mogadishu
###1158 own and use a cell phone.
###1159 There are four major cellphone companies.
###1161 Internet access from Mogadishu is actually a lot easier
###1164 than from parts of the United States
###1166 if you want to talk to people, because you're very closely
###1169 geographically connected to the international undersea cable
###1173 network.
###1174 There's a market in the middle of Mogadishu called the Bakaara
###1178 Market, which was the scene of a big gun battle
###1180 about 20 years ago.
###1183 On the ground floor of that market
###1184 is a currency trading exchange where
###1187 people are on the internet and on their cell phones,
###1189 and they're trading the Somali Shilling, which
###1192 is the currency again that survived for 20 years
###1194 without a central bank.
###1195 It floats on international exchange rates.
###1197 It gets updated five times a day,
###1199 and the traders on that floor punch out a SMS text message
###1204 to everybody that trades in the city five times
###1207 a day with the current exchange rate.
###1208 And so you have all these traders
###1209 out there on their cellphones all the time
###1211 tapping into a global patent of commerce.
###1214 And one of the things we're seeing
###1216 is that access to the international networks
###1219 of trade, things like remittance flows,
###1221 arbitrage, the movement of currency
###1223 or the movement of goods around the planet
###1225 has overtaken agricultural surplus
###1229 as a major driver of city growth.
###1231 So Mogadishu is not a city that can
###1234 be sustained by the rest of the Somali economy.
###1237 The reason that it's there and it's that big is it's
###1239 a trading city.
###1241 It's always been there, but now it's
###1243 not just a trading city that sends charcoal to Yemen,
###1246 or sends cart around the rest of the country,
###1249 and engages in basic commodities trading.
###1252 It's also a trading city that's international,
###1254 because you have 800,000 Somalis in the international diaspora,
###1259 and they're connected to the 7 1/2 million Somalis that live
###1262 in the country in a way that just never was possible before.
###1266 Another example, we mentioned Syria earlier.
###1270 Until 2000, there was virtually no internet, no satellite,
###1275 television, and no cell phone access in Syria.
###1278 Hafez al-Assad, the president of Syria from the 1970s,
###1282 came from peasant stock.
###1283 He was a bit of a Luddite.
###1284 He wasn't that interested in allowing Syrians to connect
###1286 to the rest of the world for a variety of obvious reasons,
###1290 and he essentially denied access to all this connectivity
###1294 until his death in 2000.
###1297 His son, though, Bashar al-Assad,
###1299 was a bit more of a computer nerd.
###1301 He was the president of the Syrian Computer Society
###1304 before becoming president.
###1306 He was a bit of a AV club guy at college.
###1309 He was quite interested in this issue of connectivity.
###1313 Ironically, under their previous regime,
###1315 you could get a satellite dish, but you did that
###1317 by getting it on the black market
###1319 from the Syrian military who would happily sell you one
###1321 and then track all your usage of that satellite dish thereafter.
###1324 But after 2000, there was this period known as the Damascus
###1327 Spring when Bashar al-Assad through open electronic
###1332 connectivity, and we saw this massive surge
###1335 in cell phone usage, in internet access,
###1337 in access to satellite television.
###1339 And actually if you look at the other cities
###1342 and other countries involved in the Arab Spring,
###1345 you see a very, very similar pattern
###1346 of this explosion of connectivity after 2000.
###1350 When the uprising came in 2011, that fundamentally
###1353 changed the way that the conflict developed in Syria.
###1357 Unlike the 1980s when the regime was
###1358 able to crush one city at a time because people didn't know what
###1362 was going on, this time people were
###1364 able to talk to each other.
###1365 And the uprising spread across about half a dozen cities
###1369 on the first day, and it reached 20 cities
###1372 in the first two weeks.
###1373 And so the regime was not able to get ahead of the curve
###1376 this time.
###1376 The other critical difference that we've
###1378 seen in all the Arab Spring conflicts
###1381 is the way that a tech savvy connected population that
###1385 is able to access technical instructions but also
###1388 physical manufacturing facilities
###1391 can rapidly generate weaponry and capabilities
###1394 that just weren't available even a decade ago.
###1398 And we can talk in more detail in Q&A if you like about that.
###1401 But I'll just give you one example.
###1403 In the Aleppo area-- which is in northern Syria--
###1407 last year, a bunch of guys in the Syrian free army
###1411 downloaded a bunch of instructions off the internet
###1414 and started producing their own mortar systems, which
###1416 they used Google Android phones to control.
###1420 They used the compass app and a variety of calculation tables
###1424 to decide where they're going to fire those mortars.
###1427 They look at Google Earth as a way of targeting,
###1431 and they'll use access to the internet
###1435 to basically pass messages back and forth on Twitter
###1438 to control the fall of shot.
###1442 But also they downloaded instructions
###1444 that enabled them to build their own army vehicles,
###1447 so in a backyard factory in Aleppo
###1450 last year, a bunch of guys made this thing called al-Shams,
###1453 which is their lightweight tank that has many mono chassis.
###1458 It's about 6 feet long and about 3 1/2 feet wide.
###1461 It's controlled with a Game Boy console from inside,
###1464 and you look at a flat screen television.
###1466 It doesn't have a turret, which is actually
###1467 the most complicated piece of an armored vehicle to build.
###1470 Instead, it has a remote control weapon station
###1473 where they basically a robot electric motor that
###1475 controls the 7.62 millimeter machine
###1478 gun that sits outside the turret.
###1479 And you've got a series of armored video cameras
###1482 that can be replaced if they get broken that
###1484 allow the thing to basically run through a Go Pro
###1490 to a Game Boy controller, and the guy
###1492 drives it around the streets of Aleppo
###1494 using basically home consumer entertainment
###1498 technology to control it.
###1500 When I showed it to a bunch of army guys earlier this year,
###1503 they said to me, well, why would you take all that technology
###1507 and put it into this tiny little army vehicle that's
###1509 only 3 feet wide and 6 feet long and it can't fight
###1512 another tank, because it only has a machine gun?
###1514 Well, the reason is because tanks can't get down
###1517 streets in a place like Aleppo.
###1519 A Bradley armored fighting vehicle is about 16 feet wide,
###1522 so is an Abrams tank.
###1523 They're not getting that.
###1524 They're not going to get into that environment,
###1527 and it doesn't need a big gun.
###1528 It needs a small machine gun for fighting infantry,
###1531 because it's not going to be dealing
###1532 with large armored vehicles.
###1534 So this is actually a very smart technical adaptation
###1538 of consumer electronics with basically well understood
###1541 internal combustion engine and the application of fire
###1545 in an urban environment.
###1546 But what's interesting about this is not the technology
###1549 itself.
###1550 It's the way that all these people concentrated
###1552 in an urban environment with a high degree of connectivity
###1555 have actually democratized military technology
###1558 on the ground.
###1559 And the way these conflicts have developed
###1561 is very different from how previous irregular warfare
###1565 conflicts developed.
###1566 I have case studies in the book on that stuff
###1569 and on things like the Mumbai attack
###1571 where the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists from Pakistan
###1574 used Twitter as their control feed
###1576 to actually control the attack and used downloads of Google
###1579 Earth to understand the flow of the city and how to attack it.
###1583 I have a bunch of other case studies.
###1585 Probably the most interesting to me
###1586 is actually the way that Jamaican drug gangs in Kingston
###1591 have used urban planning decisions made in the 1960s
###1595 to create these Garrison districts around the outside
###1598 of the city and control international drug
###1600 trade from slum areas around the capital city of Jamaica.
###1604 But let me finish by talking about I think what's
###1607 more germane to this discussion, which is how do we model
###1611 and understand cities under stress.
###1614 Because if I'm right about the future,
###1617 then the future environment is going
###1618 to be one of cities that are experiencing
###1620 this tsunami of inflow of population, and information,
###1624 and money, and drugs, and weapons that
###1627 come about through rapid urbanization.
###1629 And it's worth thinking about how do we model and understand
###1632 those and how do we think about resiliencies to address
###1635 those problems going forward.
###1637 So briefly on that, in looking at this in the book,
###1640 I go back to Karl Marx, weirdly enough.
###1642 So Marx-- whatever else he may have been--
###1645 was a social scientist who's looking at European cities
###1648 100 years after the beginning of that Industrial Revolution
###1651 process that I was talking about earlier.
###1653 So in the 1850s, Marx is looking at Paris, and Berlin,
###1657 and London, and he's saying what is it about these cities that
###1660 gives rise to the environment of urban squalor
###1664 that is famously written about by people
###1666 like Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens.
###1668 What is it that gives rise to that?
###1670 And he talks about what he calls a metabolic rift.
###1673 So that people that are used to living
###1675 in a rural environment, where most of the people that you
###1678 rely on for day-to-day survival are people that you're either
###1682 related to or you know personally.
###1684 And you're in this organic structure,
###1686 you then find yourself in a large urban environment
###1689 where everything's depersonalized,
###1690 and you now rely on these large institutionalized distanciated
###1695 systems that are essentially lots of moving parts
###1698 that all have to work together, or the whole thing falls over.
###1701 And he talks about how that creates this social rift
###1704 in the way that people look at each other,
###1706 but it disassociates them from the means of survival.
###1712 This idea sits fallow in urban planning for about 100 years,
###1715 and then a guy called Abel Wolman picks it up
###1717 in the 1960s, who was an urban planner,
###1720 and he writes an article that's actually
###1721 very seminal in urban ecology where
###1724 he talks about the metabolism of cities.
###1726 And Wolman's argument is pretty straightforward.
###1729 It's like if you imagine your body
###1731 as a system with various inputs and intakes of water, fuel,
###1735 food, and so on that come into your body,
###1737 and there are transformative processes
###1739 that result in energy and biomass and so on.
###1742 But they also result in toxins that
###1745 have to be metabolized and dealt with.
###1747 And if your body doesn't have the carrying capacity,
###1750 the metabolic systems in place to deal with those toxins,
###1754 then you're going to get sick.
###1755 He says you can apply the same idea to a city.
###1758 It has various inputs and inflows
###1759 and has various transformative processes,
###1762 and if the inflows overwhelm the carrying capacity
###1765 of the system, then you're going to see the emergence of toxins
###1768 that are going to result in stuff like pollution-- air
###1773 pollution, water pollution, and so on.
###1774 Now, this idea is very common now
###1778 in urban ecology in the physical sense, carbon, water,
###1781 air, how these things flow through an urban system.
###1784 And there are models that we use,
###1786 and there are material flow analysis systems
###1789 that we apply to understand that.
###1791 What I've done and what a lot of other people
###1793 have done in looking at cities in the last 10 or 20 years
###1796 is to do what I would call a non-material flow analysis.
###1799 So instead of looking at water or carbon,
###1801 we'll look at information, and money, and people, and weapons,
###1805 and drugs, and say does the city have the carrying capacity
###1809 to deal with those flows, or is it in fact getting overwhelmed.
###1812 And when you apply those kinds of models
###1815 to cities under stress, it turns out
###1817 you can start looking at them in a very different way,
###1820 and I can give you again some examples in Q&A from places
###1823 we've worked in Africa and Latin America to understand
###1826 how a city can be seen as essentially
###1829 a patent of intersecting flows rather than just
###1832 a piece of organized terrain.
###1836 Modeling that, we have found what
###1838 relies on a combination of big data, remote observation
###1843 of honest signals from the urban environment with field teams
###1847 that can understand what's beneath that data.
###1850 So we did a lot of work initially in Afghanistan,
###1852 and then subsequently in Syria, and in much of other places
###1855 in looking at environments that are under stress
###1859 and trying to understand what was going on
###1861 by remote observation.
###1863 After a while, we realized that that doesn't actually
###1866 give you the answer you're looking for.
###1869 It's like looking at a jungle canopy from above.
###1872 You can see the trees, but you don't know what's underneath.
###1874 And it turns out that you have to put a field
###1876 team on the ground to figure out what
###1878 is the delta between the observed data
###1881 and what you can see on the ground
###1883 before you can start to make predictive analysis about what
###1886 you're looking at.
###1887 So I'll give you one example, and unfortunately, Google
###1889 doesn't come into this story, because you guys charge
###1891 for use of Google Earth data.
###1893 But we used Open Street Map, which
###1896 is the Wiki version of Google Earth
###1899 to work with a series of communities, mainly
###1901 women's groups and a violence observatory
###1905 in a large African city on a coastline that
###1908 has a number of slums that are experiencing
###1910 a really high degree of violence.
###1912 Now, why women?
###1913 One of the reasons that women are
###1915 really important in this environment--
###1916 there's actually two reasons.
###1918 One is because they are consistently
###1920 excluded from the analysis.
###1922 So when you go and start looking at environments on the ground,
###1925 typically you end up speaking with elite class
###1929 urban males that speak English, which
###1932 is a pretty small subset of the environment
###1934 actually when you want to understand
###1936 what's really going on.
###1937 But much more importantly in my view
###1939 is that something like 80% of the people
###1942 that own businesses and employ people in slums
###1945 are actually women, and the reason for that
###1947 is pretty obvious.
###1948 A lot of these slums don't have a lot of jobs.
###1951 Like if you live in la Rocinha which
###1952 is a favela outside of Rio, you aren't
###1956 going to work in la Rocinha.
###1957 You're going to work downtown where the rich people need you
###1960 to sweep streets, and run the airport traffic, baggage
###1965 handling system, or drive taxis.
###1967 That's where the work is if you're a guy in la Rocinha.
###1970 If you want to work in the favela,
###1972 and you want to run a business, so you want to employ people,
###1974 then you're probably part of this network
###1977 of women small business owners that are actually
###1979 pretty common in these environments.
###1981 So we worked with these women's groups
###1983 to understand threat and risk in their slum.
###1986 And if you think about it, when you
###1988 walk through an urban environment,
###1989 you don't know if you're going to be mugged,
###1991 but you do know if it is going to happen,
###1993 it'll probably be over there.
###1994 There's just something about the environment
###1996 that tells you that it's risky.
###1997 And we built a map which essentially reflected
###2001 the community's perception of risk
###2004 in different specific areas within a slum.
###2007 And it's interesting when you compare that to the police data
###2009 that the police have-- which is again remote observation--
###2012 you would think that the government
###2013 of a large African city would know what's
###2015 going on in its environment.
###2016 Mostly they don't.
###2017 You can look at these things, and you
###2019 can identify any building off of Google Earth,
###2021 but if you talk to somebody from the government,
###2023 it's pretty rare for them to be able to tell you
###2025 what that building is.
###2027 Even if they know what the building is,
###2028 most of these streets don't have street names.
###2031 There are no house addresses, so there's
###2032 no way to record that information.
###2034 So we built these special models of where
###2037 the community felt unsafe, and we began looking at them.
###2039 We realized that actually these places have a visual signature.
###2043 There's something about them that's different,
###2045 the size of houses, the number of bins in a given
###2047 distance of road, how wide the streets
###2050 are, the density of urban lighting.
###2052 There's a whole variety of things
###2053 that make these areas look different,
###2055 and often humans can't tell that, but machines can.
###2057 And when you back up to a lot of scale model or large scale
###2061 picture, just a satellite image of a city,
###2063 you can start to pick these environments off the map,
###2066 because you know what you're looking for,
###2067 because you've done the field work.
###2069 So just the big data is not enough,
###2072 and just the field work is not enough.
###2074 The magic happens at the connectivity
###2076 between field teams that understand the environment who
###2079 are almost always entirely indigenous local inhabitants
###2083 of that environment and people sitting remotely
###2086 who can understand the bigger large end perspective.
###2089 And so a lot of what we do now in places in Africa,
###2092 and Latin America, and the Middle East
###2094 is founded on an idea that we co-ed design
###2097 where we bring a small external team with certain kinds
###2101 of technical or functional knowledge
###2103 into an environment where they work closely
###2105 under the direction of the local community.
###2108 And I'm going to take this back to warfare.
###2111 I really first experienced that in Iraq
###2115 when we finally began to turn around
###2117 what we'd been doing in Iraq.
###2118 And I'm going to end with this story,
###2120 and then I'll throw it open to questions.
###2121 When I first went into Iraq in 2006, we were in free fall.
###2125 3,000 civilians were getting killed in just Baghdad city
###2128 alone e every week.
###2130 That's a 9/11 every week.
###2132 By September of 2007, we'd reduced that
###2135 to the point where a few people getting killed was a bad night.
###2138 100 was a terrible week.
###2141 95% reduction in violence in just
###2144 a seven month period in Iraq.
###2147 How did we do that?
###2148 It wasn't because we had this great new counter insurgency
###2151 manual.
###2152 That helped.
###2153 I wasn't because we had a president who was very engaged.
###2156 Although, we wouldn't have been able to do it without that.
###2158 But actually it was because we finally did something
###2161 that we never really done before,
###2163 which is to actually start talking to the Iraqis
###2165 about how to defend their neighborhoods.
###2168 So before that, we had typically gone
###2170 into an Iraqi neighborhood, and we would swept the locals out
###2173 of the way, and we'd say sit down, shut up.
###2175 We have the answer to your problem.
###2177 We're going to back up this democracy truck.
###2179 We're going to unpack the solution,
###2181 and you guys will be very happy with the result.
###2183 And what had happened was not that.
###2185 What had happened was a city that had basically torn itself
###2187 apart for those 12 to 18 months before the surge began.
###2192 And in that time, interestingly the period
###2195 when we backed off from Baghdad, a lot of local security
###2199 councils had emerged, and people had
###2201 started to create these little security groups that
###2204 decided we're going to figure out
###2205 how to defend our own community and they had actually
###2207 gone out and put in place a whole series of systems,
###2211 not just physical systems, but reporting systems,
###2213 and information management systems,
###2215 and ways of understanding their environment,
###2217 which they had used to survive through most of 2006.
###2222 So when we finally went back in the spring of 2007
###2226 and began to reengage with Baghdad,
###2228 this time we sat down with people,
###2230 and we said tell us what you've been doing for the last year,
###2233 and what's worked, and what hasn't worked,
###2235 and what you need some additional help on,
###2238 and what we should just not touch,
###2240 and you give us this design brief
###2242 of what we should build to support
###2244 your security in your environment.
###2246 And initially they were like, what?
###2248 Because I actually had a meeting with some guys in a place
###2251 called Sadr City where they were like, what?
###2253 You want to know what we think?
###2254 They were like, dude, we've been working
###2255 with the Coalition for four years.
###2257 You're the first person that's ever asked us
###2259 what we think about how to secure our district.
###2261 And they were very, very suspicious.
###2263 When we finally began to do this stuff-- and it wasn't just me,
###2266 it was people all over Iraq-- they got religion.
###2269 Because they saw that we really were serious.
###2271 We were really going to listen to what they wanted to do,
###2273 and we're going to work with them.
###2275 And we engaged in this process of co-design,
###2277 and we actually designed stuff together
###2279 to build a solution that would work for them.
###2281 Now, there's companies here in San Francisco like IDEO,
###2284 for example, that have this idea down
###2286 in terms of participatory development and urbanization,
###2289 and they understand stuff like human centered design
###2292 as a way of engaging with communities
###2294 that are under stress to try to build a better solution.
###2298 My challenge to them and what our company's been doing
###2301 has been trying to figure out how do you
###2303 do that when people are shooting at you.
###2305 How do you do that when it's so violent that you can't just
###2308 sit down with people and say hey man, what should we do?
###2310 What are the ways you can observe
###2312 that environment remotely, and how can you
###2314 have field teams working the ground
###2315 to try to build-- what for want of a better term
###2318 I would call-- peace and resilience in environments that
###2321 are just not stable by definition.
###2324 These cities are growing at such a rate that our traditional way
###2328 of thinking about the problem, which is to bring stability,
###2331 to stabilize-- as the IMF has it ,
###2333 or to bring stability operations as the military talks about is
###2337 just not going to work.
###2338 If you were born in Daka in 1950,
###2341 you would have been born in a city of 400,000 people.
###2343 Today that city's 12 million.
###2345 It's going to be 25 million by the middle of the century.
###2348 It's not a stable system.
###2350 Stability is a systems characteristic.
###2352 Resiliency is a characteristic who's act is in the system.
###2355 Rather than trying to hold back the tide of rapid urbanization,
###2359 we need to be focusing on how to teach people to swim,
###2362 and that's a lot of what most people that
###2364 are working in this environment are now doing.
###2366 So US Aid and a lot of the other aid agencies
###2369 have now a resiliency agenda for how
###2371 they're going to bring the kind of systems
###2374 to communities that allow them to be
###2376 resilient in the face of rapid change.
###2378 And I think circling back to that Afghan ambush, that's
###2382 what we need to be looking at going forward,
###2384 not remote rural mountainous environments where you don't
###2388 have a lot of connectivity, and you
###2390 don't have a high population density.
###2392 We've become really, really good at operating
###2394 in that environment in the last decade,
###2396 but the future environment is not that.
###2398 It's big cities on coastlines in the developing
###2402 world with an enormous degree of connectivity,
###2404 and there's a massive upside set of opportunities
###2408 to lift people out of poverty, to bring all kinds of benefits
###2411 to communities that don't have them now,
###2413 to actually generate peace as this thing from just
###2416 the absence of conflict.
###2418 That opportunity is there alongside a huge set
###2422 of risks that will confront us if we don't deal
###2425 with this massive population tsunami that's bearing down
###2428 on coastal cities in the next generation.
###2431 So let me stop there and summarize
###2433 by saying we need to get our heads out of the mountains,
###2435 and start thinking about this future urban environment.
###2439 And I'm going to throw the floor open to questions,
###2441 so I don't know how you want to run.
###2443 If you guys want to nominate, and we'll go from there.
###2446 AUDIENCE: When we were speaking earlier,
###2448 you had talked about inoculating cities with some resiliency
###2452 as they're going through this rapid growth.
###2454 Could you talk a little bit more about that please?
###2456 DAVID KILCULLEN: So great point, Chris.
###2458 So, we're not just talking about cities that are there now.
###2463 One projection by the Indian Institute
###2465 for Human Settlements-- which is like their heart organization--
###2469 is that the entire west coast of India
###2471 is going to be one single giant conurbation by 2040.
###2475 So large slums will fill in the currently existing space
###2479 between existing cities.
###2481 There's a guy called Mike Davis out in Hawaii
###2483 who's written a number of really good books, one which
###2486 is called "Planet of Slums" where he projects that we're
###2489 going to see this giant slum spoil fill
###2493 in the space between existing cities.
###2495 So there's paradoxes that a lot of the problems of urbanization
###2499 that we're going to see in the next generation
###2501 are going to happen in cities that aren't there yet,
###2504 because they haven't happened yet.
###2505 And so part of this is about getting ahead of the curve
###2508 and thinking about what do these kinds of environments
###2511 need to channel them into a pathway of urban development
###2515 that's going to result in a different future.
###2517 And I'm trying in the book not to predict a dystopian view.
###2521 If you want that, go read "Snow Crash"
###2523 by Neal Stephenson, which is 15 years old,
###2525 but it's all there in California.
###2528 So this stuff's been figured out as a dystopian vision already.
###2532 What I'm doing is making a projection
###2535 based on current data and saying it
###2537 doesn't have to be that future.
###2539 It can actually be different.
###2540 And I think it's about thinking about where will cities grow to
###2543 and what happens when rapid unchecked urban growth acretes
###2547 around an existing city.
###2548 So you get this donut shaped or horseshoe shaped ring
###2551 of terrain that clusters around an existing city,
###2555 but it didn't used to be empty terrain.
###2557 That's where the city grew its food.
###2559 It's where the water catchment area was.
###2561 It's where a lot of the transportation roots
###2563 come through.
###2564 So you have this ring of slums that
###2566 emerge around a city that separates
###2568 the city from the sources of all those critical commodities,
###2571 the inflows of the metabolism that it needs to survive.
###2574 And these are areas where you don't
###2576 have a lot of government presence.
###2577 You don't have a lot of government services.
###2579 And so non-state armed groups often
###2582 emerge and end up controlling these environments,
###2585 and they don't just smuggle drugs.
###2587 They actually provide governance services in these environments.
###2591 And it's typical of governments to look at these as a threat.
###2595 I don't see them that way at all.
###2596 These are people who are engaging in stuff
###2598 that the government either can't or won't
###2599 do that the population needs.
###2601 They're actually fulfilling a central function
###2604 to the existence of the city, but what
###2605 it means if you're an urban politician downtown
###2608 is there's now a ring of territory that's
###2610 like a gauntlet around the city, and all the supplies
###2613 that the city needs to survive have
###2614 to run that gauntlet every day, and there's
###2617 a non-state armed group, a malitia, or a communitarian
###2620 group that's sitting astride that.
###2621 And you're going to have to deal with that group,
###2623 because if you don't, they can shut the city down.
###2626 So I think it's stuff like that.
###2628 It's understanding how do we enable urban growth
###2633 in a way that isn't going to generate
###2634 the kind of urban exclusion, and marginalization,
###2637 and political disposition of these people
###2640 that then creates the ground in which all this stuff takes
###2644 place.
###2644 And for the military guys, how are we
###2647 going to operate in giant cities like this which
###2650 could absorb a marine regiment or an army division and not
###2652 even notice?
###2654 It's going to have to be different from the traditional
###2657 way that we've thought about operational maneuver
###2659 from the sea or maneuver operational
###2661 in a littoral environment, because it's just so big now
###2664 that you're looking at a whole different space.
###2666 A lot more to talk about on that,
###2667 but I think getting ahead of the curve
###2669 is about predicting where the problem is going
###2671 to be in cities that haven't even happened yet
###2673 and how do you understand the resiliences that prevent
###2677 this kind of symptoms from developing
###2680 and to stop them in their tracks.
###2682 AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.
###2684 Let's see.
###2685 Max Boot spoke here recently.
###2688 He's the author of the book on guerrilla warfare.
###2691 And at one point he said-- I think
###2692 I'm quoting him right-- that urban areas were not
###2696 very friendly for guerrillas, and his reason
###2700 was that it's too exposed.
###2704 You can't have meetings and organize.
###2706 You can't do rifle practice.
###2709 Clearly you disagree.
###2710 Do you think that's a factor, or [INAUDIBLE]?
###2712 DAVID KILCULLEN: Well, I think Max was just
###2714 a great book in his latest book, and I
###2715 have a lot of respect for his point of view.
###2717 And I think if you look at the big sweep of history
###2720 of guerrillas, which is what he's doing in the book,
###2722 he's right that traditionally guerrillas don't operate
###2725 in cities and haven't had a great degree of success
###2727 in cities.
###2728 And the reason for that is guerrillas
###2730 go to where the cover is.
###2732 They go to where they can hide.
###2733 And for most of human history, that's
###2735 been mountains and jungles, but today we
###2737 have foliage penetrating radar that can see through jungles.
###2739 And we've got drones that can sit on top of a mountain range
###2742 24 hours a day and tell you where the bad guys are.
###2745 There's not a lot of cover in the rural environment anymore.
###2749 The cover is in the cities.
###2750 And there's another key idea that
###2751 comes in here, which is the idea of legibility.
###2754 So there's a great guy up at Yale
###2756 called James C. Scott who's a professor.
###2758 I don't think you can be a professor of [INAUDIBLE]
###2761 studies, but that's basically what he is.
###2763 And he wrote an awesome book called
###2764 "Seeing Like a State" where he talks about how
###2768 what governments try to do is they
###2769 try to make environments legible,
###2771 so they can read and interpret.
###2773 And if you work in Google, you basically work
###2775 in a giant legibility project, trying
###2777 to make the entire planet legible so the people can
###2780 understand that and do things with it.
###2783 There are huge parts of the planet that are not legible,
###2787 and most of those places now are in cities.
###2790 They're not in well developed well designed cities.
###2793 They're in these clusters of slums
###2795 where there's no street addresses,
###2796 and there's no house numbers, and you can spot a building
###2798 from space, but you don't know what's there,
###2800 and there's no way to understand who lives there.
###2802 Now that we have things like GDELT-- the global database
###2806 of events, language, and tone-- which
###2807 has been built for about 15 years or so,
###2809 and we have Twitter feeds that we can geolocate.
###2813 There's things that are emerging that allow us to make cities
###2816 more legible than they'd been in the past.
###2819 But I believe the balance has shifted
###2821 so that the urban environment is now
###2823 the safer environment for irregular operators compared
###2826 to the countryside.
###2828 That doesn't mean we won't see conflict in the mountains
###2831 and in the jungles.
###2832 We most definitely will.
###2833 But irregular conflict tends to happen where people live.
###2837 The vast majority of people are going
###2838 to be in urban environments, and the city now
###2841 is the area where you've got more
###2843 cover than the rural environment.
###2845 So I think Max is right as a historical statement about what
###2848 the history of irregular conflict has been,
###2850 but I think we're at a watershed where going forward we're
###2854 going to see increasing preponderance of this kind
###2858 of conflict happening not in downtown cities,
###2861 but in slums and in this ring of uncontrolled illegible
###2864 territory around the outside.
###2866 AUDIENCE: So you talk about where
###2867 you think the slums are going to grow and try to get ahead
###2869 of it, but it seems like any service you do in that area
###2873 before the slums is just going to draw
###2875 the people there and bring the slum sooner.
###2878 If you put schools and parks, you're
###2880 just going to end up with slums at the schools and parks.
###2883 How do you get ahead of it?
###2885 The real problem is just too much people
###2887 with not enough jobs.
###2889 DAVID KILCULLEN: Right, that's a great point.
###2890 In fact, there's a woman called Sheela Patel who
###2892 runs an organization called SPARC in Mumbai who
###2895 makes this point.
###2895 She says the government has decided not to provide services
###2899 to people in slums, because they think
###2902 it's going to attract people to the slums.
###2904 One of the great examples of that is sanitation.
###2906 So the Indian government says that an acceptable level
###2909 of sanitation is one toilet per 50 people.
###2912 Right now it's one toilet per 600 people
###2915 in many of the slums in Mumbai.
###2917 And she says as if people moved to slums
###2919 just because they want access to a toilet.
###2922 There's plenty of places to crap in the woods.
###2924 Actually people are moving to cities
###2926 because of economic opportunity.
###2928 And I also think-- and we see this
###2930 in a number of places-- because of the connectivity
###2933 differential between rural environments
###2935 and the urban environment, if now
###2937 the way that you make your money is by access
###2940 to a globalized economy and you need connectivity
###2943 to do that and there's a connectivity differential
###2945 between the rural environment where you don't have
###2947 that connectivity and the urban environment when you do,
###2950 then one of the major reasons why people are moving to cities
###2953 is because that's where the Wi-Fi is.
###2954 That's where the internet is.
###2956 That's where the density of cell phone coverage
###2958 is that allows you to tap into that environment.
###2960 So I think that tells you that there
###2962 are three ways to really address this.
###2965 One is to attack the supply side,
###2968 to do things in the rural environment that
###2971 make it better for people that are there so that they don't
###2974 decide we're going to pick up and move to urban environments
###2977 at quite the same rate.
###2978 So more rural Wi-Fi, better access to cell phones
###2982 in the countryside, water, sanitation, education, conflict
###2987 resolution in the kinds of conflicts
###2988 we were talking about here that will still
###2990 happen in the rural environment, there's
###2994 a supply side problem of how do you address
###2998 people deciding to move to the city.
###3000 Then in the city itself, there are all these resiliency
###3002 interventions that you can undertake in order
###3005 to make it hard of a conflict to break out,
###3009 to create ways to resolve that conflict quicker,
###3012 and to bring in the kinds of services that prevent conflicts
###3015 from developing in the first place.
###3016 So they're the demand side, or how do you
###3019 increase the carrying capacity of an urban system in such
###3022 a way that it can handle the flow?
###3024 But then ultimately, though,
###3025 AUDIENCE: I think nothing we can do
###3028 is going to stop the giant tendency of populations
###3032 to move to urban environments.
###3033 It's more about helping people cope better
###3036 with the environment they find themselves
###3038 in than about turning off the tap.
###3042 AUDIENCE: I just have trouble seeing how to grow resiliency
###3044 when it means a slum is stronger because more people live there.
###3048 I mean, that's resiliency in the anti-fragile sense.
###3050 You get stronger because more people come.
###3053 I don't see how to do that.
###3054 DAVID KILCULLEN: There's actually-- well,
###3055 you should buy my book then, because there's
###3057 a lot of case studies in there.
###3059 In the last chapter, I look at several examples of things
###3062 that I think suggest ways to think about this.
###3066 I would just say I'm not suggesting
###3067 that I have the answer.
###3069 What I'm doing is pointing to two things.
###3071 One is there's this problem out there which
###3073 we need to be thinking about, and I
###3075 think that actually in the urban studies
###3076 environment and actually a lot of people in the data science
###3079 community, people are already thinking about that.
###3082 But the military's been sidetracked
###3084 into this other environment for the last decade,
###3086 and as we come back out of that environment,
###3088 I think we have to put that conversation back together
###3091 again and have people that really understand military,
###3095 and law enforcement, and all those kinds
###3097 of other kinds of operations in the environment,
###3099 reengage with a debate that's actually
###3101 moved on a lot in the last 12 years
###3104 while we've been busy in Afghanistan.
###3106 And the other thing that I think it is to reemphasize
###3109 is you have littoral, because being on a coastline
###3112 is different from being in a city elsewhere.
###3115 Just one example of that, last year
###3117 for the first time in history, there
###3118 was a simultaneous outbreak of cholera in four West African
###3122 countries during the monsoon season,
###3124 and the reason for that is people
###3126 have moved to slums on the outskirts of these cities.
###3128 A lot of those slums are built on stilts over the sea.
###3132 They don't have sanitation.
###3133 There was a tidal storm surge that pushed a lot of sewage
###3137 from these slums into the inland water system and infected lots
###3141 of people with cholera, but all these cities
###3144 are connected with each other through coastal shipping
###3147 and air transportation so that the infection spread nearly
###3151 simultaneously.
###3152 There's a very interesting study by the World Health
###3154 Organization where they look at how air travel in particular
###3157 completely invalidates our traditional way of handling
###3160 infectious disease.
###3161 If you have the right incubation period
###3165 and you posit the idea of a continued air traffic system,
###3171 it can be around the entire system
###3173 before the first patient gets sick.
###3175 So instead of having breakout in one country and you then
###3178 contain that, you can have simultaneous outbreak
###3181 in basically every continent except Antarctica because
###3183 of the way the air transportation system works.
###3186 Who runs baggage handling systems in most of the world?
###3189 Who is the workforce in most airports?
###3191 It's people that don't live in the rich districts downtown.
###3193 It's people that live in the slums around the outside.
###3196 So I think this is the sort of stuff where
###3198 we need to be really engaging to think about how do we get ahead
###3201 of the curve, and maybe we can.
###3203 Maybe you're right.
###3204 I hope that's not true, but it's at least worth
###3207 thinking about it I think.
###3208 AUDIENCE: Hey, thanks for coming.
###3210 I wanted to ask about if we have this large population
###3213 growth over the next 30 years, have all these people moving
###3216 into cities and then simultaneously
###3219 from other people, particularly like futurists like Peter
###3222 Diamandis and such who have these ideas that talk about
###3224 well, we'll have more and more technology.
###3226 We'll have to stop worrying about low level agriculture
###3229 so much as more of that's-- we'll just say-- automated.
###3234 So I was wondering if you had any thoughts on what the job
###3238 or what the working situation looks like for people
###3240 in these cities as we get these giant populations.
###3244 DAVID KILCULLEN: Yeah, I've looked
###3246 at that in a little bit of detail,
###3247 but not actually as much as I would like to.
###3250 I think there's a whole additional study here
###3252 that's not only focused on employment,
###3257 but it's focus on the intersection of various things
###3261 that the aid and development community takes for granted.
###3264 So, I had an interesting discussing with the Gates
###3266 Foundation last year about maternal health and infant
###3270 mortality.
###3271 And of course, if you're running a private philanthropic
###3274 organization, you have to define what your field of action
###3277 is going to be, and if that's your field of action, that's
###3279 where you're going to focus.
###3281 But the fact is if you come up with effective maternal health
###3283 and infant mortality programs now,
###3286 you better have an education plan for five or six
###3288 years from now, and you better have an employment
###3290 plan for 18 years from now, or you're
###3291 going end up with what happened to the Libyans
###3294 where the Libyans did a great job in the '70s and '80s
###3297 improving public health, which resulted in a youth
###3300 bulge, which resulted in a lot of people hitting college age.
###3303 And the Libyan education system was well
###3306 developed for making people literate,
###3308 giving them skills in English, and helping them become very
###3311 politically aware, but it was really bad at generating people
###3314 that had skills that were relevant to the Libyan economy,
###3317 which is basically oil and gas.
###3319 So you had this massive number of expats doing those jobs,
###3323 and a lot of people coming out of Libyan colleges
###3325 ended up working for the civil service,
###3328 because basically they just created
###3329 this giant public service in order
###3331 to absorb all these people that didn't have usable skills.
###3333 Then you had these government departments that were basically
###3336 just jobs programs and didn't exist
###3338 to provide any service to the community,
###3340 so you had this breakdown of trust between the government
###3342 and the population and this giant underemployment
###3346 challenge.
###3347 And that was the recruiting pool from which
###3348 people sprung in 2011 against the regime when they began
###3353 seeing places like Dubai and Kuwait
###3356 on the television, which they'd never had access to until 2003.
###3359 And they're like, hang on a second,
###3361 how come those guys are living like that,
###3362 and we're living like this?
###3364 So I think that issue is critically important,
###3368 figuring out the intersections of all these different programs
###3371 and how they work together.
###3373 I think-- and this is just my point
###3374 of view based on not a huge amount of data,
###3377 but just based on observing a lot of these cities--
###3380 there's a lot of jobs out there that
###3382 are emerging through self-synchronization
###3385 at the local level.
###3387 So if you want to go on your Google mapping app,
###3391 and you live in Lagos, and you want to check the traffic,
###3396 it's useless, because it's red all the time.
###3399 Lagos seems to have words for traffic
###3401 like Eskimos have words for snow.
###3402 There's so many people there.
###3404 It's the infrastructure of a medium
###3406 sized town with a population the size of Australia basically.
###3411 And it's always red.
###3413 But, there are about 25 different local level radio
###3416 stations that only broadcast for a few blocks
###3419 where people call in and tell the radio
###3421 DJ what's going on with traffic, and you
###3424 don't go on Google to find out traffic.
###3426 You just change-- people have written up
###3428 on their window the frequencies of these local radio stations,
###3431 and they just change from one to another as they move through.
###3434 And they've basically self-synchronized
###3436 their own traffic information system
###3439 based on totally analog means in that environment.
###3442 So there's a lot of those kinds of things.
###3444 And there's also a cognitive elite,
###3446 which is not the machine.
###3447 It's the marriage of machine and human
###3450 that's actually driving forward a lot
###3451 of the economic development in places that we see.
###3454 I can talk about that offline if you want,
###3456 because it's a whole other discussion.
###3458 But then there's a lot of people that are basically dispossessed
###3461 because of this change, and what happens to those people
###3465 will drive a lot of what happens in these environments I think.
###3469 AUDIENCE: Thank you.
###3469 
###3471 MALE SPEAKER: Thanks for coming.
###3473 Let's have a warm hand for David Kilcullen.
###3475 DAVID KILCULLEN: Hey, thank you for having me.
###3477
