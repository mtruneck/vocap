CLEO LE-TAN: Oh my god.


4
0:0:17,856 --> 0:0:20,86
I'm a bit scared.


5
0:0:20,86 --> 0:0:22,11
Don't really like this smell.


6
0:0:22,11 --> 0:0:24,61



7
0:0:24,61 --> 0:0:27,38
There's loads of
things written.


8
0:0:27,38 --> 0:0:32,58
"The big pussy of her granny
is being fucked by all the


9
0:0:32,58 --> 0:0:38,63
guys from France." "Fuck
the police."


10
0:0:38,63 --> 0:0:39,935
Some people are coming.


11
0:0:39,935 --> 0:0:49,24



12
0:0:49,24 --> 0:0:52,43
This May, the world watched as
French President Nicolas


13
0:0:52,43 --> 0:0:56,15
Sarkozy, a small elf-like
creature who dominated the


14
0:0:56,15 --> 0:0:59,28
country's political landscape
the past five years, was


15
0:0:59,28 --> 0:1:3,3
finally defeated by Francois
Hollande, a boring, floppy man


16
0:1:3,3 --> 0:1:4,89
from the rival Socialist
Party.


17
0:1:4,89 --> 0:1:8,5
The election was dominated by a
number of baffling European


18
0:1:8,5 --> 0:1:9,86
financial issues.


19
0:1:9,86 --> 0:1:11,415
Boring!


20
0:1:11,415 --> 0:1:14,58
But what wasn't discussed was
a crisis that had been


21
0:1:14,58 --> 0:1:17,1
simmering for years in the
Parisian suburbs--


22
0:1:17,1 --> 0:1:20,84
the same suburbs in which, seven
years ago, two teenagers


23
0:1:20,84 --> 0:1:23,78
were tasered to death while
running from the police.


24
0:1:23,78 --> 0:1:26,91
As retaliation, hundreds of
residents from Parisian


25
0:1:26,91 --> 0:1:30,19
council estates started rioting,
protesting against


26
0:1:30,19 --> 0:1:33,5
police and their lack of
employment opportunities.


27
0:1:33,5 --> 0:1:36,78
Almost 3,000 rioters were
arrested, five police officers


28
0:1:36,78 --> 0:1:39,75
lost their lives, and 60
others were wounded.


29
0:1:39,75 --> 0:1:43,21
Fast-forward to now, and the
media has more or less


30
0:1:43,21 --> 0:1:46,45
forgotten about these areas and
the people who live there.


31
0:1:46,45 --> 0:1:49,31
But every now and then, the
French Vice Office would come


32
0:1:49,31 --> 0:1:52,6
across new rap artists from
these suburbs whose angry


33
0:1:52,6 --> 0:1:55,9
music suggested that none of
the problems in the suburbs


34
0:1:55,9 --> 0:1:56,4
had gone away.


35
0:1:56,4 --> 0:1:59,68
They were all still making music
as aggressive as ever,


36
0:1:59,68 --> 0:2:1,1
just like the days
when the suburbs


37
0:2:1,1 --> 0:2:2,99
were going up in flames.


38
0:2:2,99 --> 0:2:6,4
So we set out there to meet all
these artists and some of


39
0:2:6,4 --> 0:2:9,33
their friends, and that is
why this film is called--


40
0:2:9,33 --> 0:2:17,24



41
0:2:17,24 --> 0:2:19,856
It's the worst candy floss
I've ever seen.


42
0:2:19,856 --> 0:2:21,76
Hello, my name is Cleo.


43
0:2:21,76 --> 0:2:24,57
I grew up in Paris, but I still
love all the tourist


44
0:2:24,57 --> 0:2:26,96
destinations like the Louvre,
the Tuileries


45
0:2:26,96 --> 0:2:29,6
Gardens, the Concorde.


46
0:2:29,6 --> 0:2:32,82
I'd heard about areas like
Clichy-sous-bois and Evry in


47
0:2:32,82 --> 0:2:36,27
the news, but I'd never actually
explored them.


48
0:2:36,27 --> 0:2:39,28
So when Vice told me they wanted
to do a story about the


49
0:2:39,28 --> 0:2:42,36
situation over there, I got
excited and I called up my


50
0:2:42,36 --> 0:2:46,185
friend the director Romain
Gavras for a bit of advice.


51
0:2:46,185 --> 0:2:49,62
Romain made his first videos in
the suburbs years ago and


52
0:2:49,62 --> 0:2:52,25
put me in touch with a rapper
called Byron, who said he


53
0:2:52,25 --> 0:2:55,58
would show me the world of
underground French rap.


54
0:2:55,58 --> 0:2:59,52
So we went to meet him and he
took us to his home in Clichy.

CLEO LE-TAN: Byron told us that
if we wanted to find out


75
0:4:44,77 --> 0:4:47,5
about the southern part of the
suburbs, we should go and talk


76
0:4:47,5 --> 0:4:51,33
to the guys from La Comera, a
rap group from Grigny, La

CLEO LE-TAN: I really want to
talk to that other guy with


85
0:5:58,29 --> 0:6:0,565
the braids, but he
seems a bit--


86
0:6:0,565 --> 0:6:1,83
he's a bit scary.

CLEO LE-TAN: I'm a bit scared,
because he seemed a bit manic.


90
0:6:27,78 --> 0:6:29,922
Are you guys going to come
with me in the car?


91
0:6:29,922 --> 0:6:31,395
Should I have accepted?


92
0:6:31,395 --> 0:6:32,868
Should I have gone for it?


93
0:6:32,868 --> 0:6:34,22
I don't know.


94
0:6:34,22 --> 0:6:38,0
Because he was driving like a
maniac earlier on, wasn't he?

[SPEAKING FRENCH]


96
0:6:39,771 --> 0:6:54,1

0:6:54,1 --> 0:6:58,76

98
0:6:58,76 --> 0:6:59,575
onion?


99
0:6:59,575 --> 0:7:2,45
And he kept like going over me
and he was like, wait, hang


100
0:7:2,45 --> 0:7:3,74
on, I'll do that for you.


101
0:7:3,74 --> 0:7:6,35
And it was like a really raw,
weird smell of onion.


102
0:7:6,35 --> 0:7:8,47
It wasn't like, oh my
god, you stink.


103

he quite liked me.


107
0:7:27,258 --> 0:7:29,65
I mean, he kept asking if we
were going to hang out and


108
0:7:29,65 --> 0:7:31,49
stuff and when he was going to
pick me up, et cetera, et


109

0:8:26,52 --> 0:8:28,79
There was a mattress
against the wall.


126
0:8:28,79 --> 0:8:31,15
There were some leather
couches.


127
0:8:31,15 --> 0:8:32,48
There was a massive screen.


128
0:8:32,48 --> 0:8:34,87
Behind that table was a
pit-bull, and he's just


129
0:8:34,87 --> 0:8:36,59
sitting there the whole time.


130
0:8:36,59 --> 0:8:39,789

Smoked a bit of weed, had a bit
of a drink, they rapped.

had a few dates lined

up with said driver, and met
loads of new people.
