1
0:0:6,6 --> 0:0:14,389
The hunt for planets beyond our solar system
has reached a fever pitch.


2
0:0:14,389 --> 0:0:22,97
With some 500 planets revealed by ground telescopes,
now, the ultimate planet finder, the Kepler


3
0:0:22,97 --> 0:0:29,22
space telescope, has released a tsunami of
data.


4
0:0:29,22 --> 0:0:36,39
Among over a thousand new planet prospects
are 200 multi-planet solar systems and 58


5
0:0:36,39 --> 0:0:43,98
worlds in life-friendly orbits.


6
0:0:43,98 --> 0:0:50,45
They're all within a narrow window on the
sky the size of your hand. That's why this


7
0:0:50,45 --> 0:0:59,62
may be the tip of the iceberg in a galaxy
that's literally crawling with planets.


8
0:0:59,62 --> 0:1:13,179
Scientists are now beginning to envision what
these worlds are like, with atmospheres, oceans,


9
0:1:13,179 --> 0:1:17,829
geological history.


10
0:1:17,829 --> 0:1:38,24
In the process, they are redefining what a
planet might need to spawn life.


11
0:1:38,24 --> 0:1:45,389
On a clear night, far from city lights, you
can see around 2000 stars with your eyes.


12
0:1:45,389 --> 0:1:51,829
That's a tiny fraction of all there are in
the galaxy at large.


13
0:1:51,829 --> 0:1:57,39
And yet, even with the largest telescopes,
most stars appear only as points of light,


14
0:1:57,39 --> 0:2:6,719
bright dots that offer few clues to one of
our most searching questions...


15
0:2:6,719 --> 0:2:18,15
Are there other worlds like ours, or are we
bound to a lonely oasis, Earth, amid a barren


16
0:2:18,15 --> 0:2:19,159
universe?


17
0:2:19,159 --> 0:2:28,39
So far, in this age of planet hunting, we've
yet to find anything like our solar system.


18
0:2:28,39 --> 0:2:36,1
Instead, astronomers have glimpsed a diverse
planetary zoo, with giant planets in wide


19
0:2:36,1 --> 0:2:40,31
orbits around their parent stars, others that
swing in so close they leave a comet-like


20
0:2:40,31 --> 0:2:51,95
tail, or molten rocky worlds emblazoned with
oceans of lava.


21
0:2:51,95 --> 0:2:59,79
These finds have added new complexity to theories
of how solar systems emerge in the birth of


22
0:2:59,79 --> 0:3:1,12
a star.


23
0:3:1,12 --> 0:3:13,599
As dust and gas swirl into the newborn star,
they form a proto-planetary disk.


24
0:3:13,599 --> 0:3:20,0
Within this Frisbee-like structure, gravity
sculpts planetary bodies that grow in size,


25
0:3:20,0 --> 0:3:25,7
sweeping up smaller bodies that form around
them.


26
0:3:25,7 --> 0:3:34,409
Current theory holds that giant planets, forming
on the periphery, commonly migrate into the


27
0:3:34,409 --> 0:3:44,23
inner solar system. This confirms the observation
of so-called hot Jupiters orbiting perilously


28
0:3:44,23 --> 0:3:47,209
close to their parent stars.


29
0:3:47,209 --> 0:3:53,609
But these giants may clear out smaller rocky
planets that form close to the star, creating


30
0:3:53,609 --> 0:4:1,51
a planetary desert... just where you'd hope
to find life.


31
0:4:1,51 --> 0:4:9,34
Does that make the search for another Earth
a wild goose chase? To find out, a group of


32
0:4:9,34 --> 0:4:16,12
planet hunters, using the Keck Telescope in
Hawaii, examined a sample of 166 sun-like


33
0:4:16,12 --> 0:4:20,94
stars within 80 light years of Earth.


34
0:4:20,94 --> 0:4:26,31
Over a five-year period, they looked for tiny
wobbles in the stars' light that might betray


35
0:4:26,31 --> 0:4:28,28
the gravitational tug of planets.


36
0:4:28,28 --> 0:4:36,949
Their conclusion: only one or two stars in
a hundred have a Jupiter-sized planet.


37
0:4:36,949 --> 0:4:41,22
Six have a planet the size of Neptune.


38
0:4:41,22 --> 0:4:50,1
To their surprise, twelve have large rocky
worlds called super Earths. This means that


39
0:4:50,1 --> 0:4:57,77
as many as a quarter of all sun-like stars
should have planets roughly the size of Earth.


40
0:4:57,77 --> 0:5:6,77
Now enter the Kepler Space Telescope, launched
in March 2009 on a mission to find Earth-like


41
0:5:6,77 --> 0:5:8,15
planets.


42
0:5:8,15 --> 0:5:15,63
Astronomers aimed its camera into the Milky
Way's Orion arm at a region covering just


43
0:5:15,63 --> 0:5:20,88
.4% of the sky.


44
0:5:20,88 --> 0:5:25,289
Kepler's sensitive detectors are designed
to pick up slight dips in a star's brightness,


45
0:5:25,289 --> 0:5:31,91
the possible signature of a planet passing
in front.


46
0:5:31,91 --> 0:5:39,78
Over a four-month period in 2009, it observed
the light of over 150,000 stars, within 3000


47
0:5:39,78 --> 0:5:46,3
light years of Earth. The data showed that
at least in one case, the planetary desert


48
0:5:46,3 --> 0:5:50,8
is not so barren.


49
0:5:50,8 --> 0:5:58,38
The star Kepler 11 is a yellow dwarf similar
to our sun. It has at least five planets close


50
0:5:58,38 --> 0:6:3,75
enough to be inside the orbit of our Mercury,
with a sixth inside the orbit of Venus.


51
0:6:3,75 --> 0:6:12,34
There may well be additional planets further
out. That won't be known until 2012, when


52
0:6:12,34 --> 0:6:18,129
data from longer orbits is complete.


53
0:6:18,129 --> 0:6:24,58
Overall, Kepler turned up 58 planets in the
so-called habitable zone. Most are large gas


54
0:6:24,58 --> 0:6:32,9
planets, but who's to say that some of them
don't have moons with liquid water?


55
0:6:32,9 --> 0:6:37,139
Think Pandora.


56
0:6:37,139 --> 0:6:42,69
With a growing planetary database, astronomers
are beginning to redefine what it takes to


57
0:6:42,69 --> 0:6:47,639
spawn life as we know it.


58
0:6:47,639 --> 0:6:53,72
Ideally, astronomers will one day stumble
upon a world about the size of Earth, with


59
0:6:53,72 --> 0:7:4,5
oceans, an atmosphere, a moon to stabilize
its orbit, a robust magnetic field to shelter


60
0:7:4,5 --> 0:7:9,979
it from solar winds, and creatures beaming
television shows into space that reveal their


61
0:7:9,979 --> 0:7:26,71
presence.


62
0:7:26,71 --> 0:7:32,75
Until then, the most fertile ground for finding
life turns out to be a long-overlooked class


63
0:7:32,75 --> 0:7:33,46
of stars.


64
0:7:33,46 --> 0:7:43,65
M Stars, or red dwarfs, range from one half
to one-twentieth the mass of our sun and make


65
0:7:43,65 --> 0:7:49,9
up 76% of all the stars in our galaxy.


66
0:7:49,9 --> 0:7:55,12
The most famous is in the southern constellation
of Libra, just 20 light years away, called


67
0:7:55,12 --> 0:7:56,409
Gliese 581.


68
0:7:56,409 --> 0:8:2,889
A team of French and Swiss astronomers had
been studying its light from a telescope in


69
0:8:2,889 --> 0:8:5,9
the mountains of Chile.


70
0:8:5,9 --> 0:8:11,639
They noticed a slight jitter: the gravitational
tugging of planets.


71
0:8:11,639 --> 0:8:18,849
From this so-called radial velocity, they
deduced the presence of Gliese 581B, a planet


72
0:8:18,849 --> 0:8:25,169
with sixteen times the mass of Earth. At a
distance of only six million kilometers, it's


73
0:8:25,169 --> 0:8:28,58
bound to be very hot.


74
0:8:28,58 --> 0:8:36,64
Then came planet C, with an orbit of 11 million
kilometers. Still too hot.


75
0:8:36,64 --> 0:8:42,74
Then there's D, at about 33 million kilometers
from its sun.


76
0:8:42,74 --> 0:8:49,0
At the outer edge of the star's habitable
zone, it receives only 30% of the light that


77
0:8:49,0 --> 0:8:53,3
Earth gets from our Sun.


78
0:8:53,3 --> 0:9:2,43
Compare it to Mars, where surface temperatures
average around -59 degrees Celsius.


79
0:9:2,43 --> 0:9:8,1
Astronomers suspect that Planet D is an icy
world that migrated in from the outer solar


80
0:9:8,1 --> 0:9:11,64
system.


81
0:9:11,64 --> 0:9:20,38
It's too extreme to be of interest to SETI,
the Search for Extra Terrestrial intelligence.


82
0:9:20,38 --> 0:9:23,37
But not to a group called Active SETI.


83
0:9:23,37 --> 0:9:29,98
Hoping to hasten contact, the social networking
site Bebo, in collaboration with a Russian


84
0:9:29,98 --> 0:9:38,8
radio astronomer, used a dish in Ukraine to
beam 500 text messages to Gliese 581.


85
0:9:38,8 --> 0:9:44,51
Another group used the Deep Space Communication
Complex at Tidbinbilla, Australia to beam


86
0:9:44,51 --> 0:9:50,61
25,000 messages. It's not interstellar spam.


87
0:9:50,61 --> 0:9:58,41
"Think big," said the messages, "We come in
peace," and "Dare to dream."


88
0:9:58,41 --> 0:10:4,26
It'll take 20 years to get there, and 20 more
to find out if the aliens hit the "like" button.


89
0:10:4,26 --> 0:10:11,25
Or if they need help.


90
0:10:11,25 --> 0:10:16,23
Red dwarfs are known as "Flare Stars" for
the violent eruptions that take place on their


91
0:10:16,23 --> 0:10:19,74
surfaces.


92
0:10:19,74 --> 0:10:27,13
In 1985, the red dwarf AD Leo erupted with
a thousand times more power than the worst


93
0:10:27,13 --> 0:10:31,37
solar eruptions.


94
0:10:31,37 --> 0:10:36,11
To find out what that would do to a planet
in a close orbit, scientists simulated the


95
0:10:36,11 --> 0:10:38,63
blast.


96
0:10:38,63 --> 0:10:44,0
They found that ultraviolet radiation from
the star would split oxygen molecules in the


97
0:10:44,0 --> 0:10:51,7
planet's atmosphere, forming ozone. That could
be enough to shield it from harm.


98
0:10:51,7 --> 0:11:0,2
Studies like this are prompting scientists
to redefine just what they mean by "habitable


99
0:11:0,2 --> 0:11:2,57
zone."


100
0:11:2,57 --> 0:11:6,51
It's the old Goldilocks story.


101
0:11:6,51 --> 0:11:14,75
Some bears go for a walk to let their porridge
cool. Then a girl comes along. One is too


102
0:11:14,75 --> 0:11:20,839
hot. Two is too cold. Three is just right.


103
0:11:20,839 --> 0:11:28,55
When the bears finally return, Goldilocks
hops out the window and runs away.


104
0:11:28,55 --> 0:11:32,74
Is that a metaphor for Contact?


105
0:11:32,74 --> 0:11:39,22
We now know it's not just our distance from
the sun that makes Earth habitable.


106
0:11:39,22 --> 0:11:44,74
Venus is about 41 million kilometers closer
to the Sun, but because of its thick cloud


107
0:11:44,74 --> 0:11:49,76
cover, 30% less solar energy reaches its surface.


108
0:11:49,76 --> 0:11:58,48
And yet, surface temperatures spike at 495
degrees Celsius. The reason is that the planet's


109
0:11:58,48 --> 0:12:5,32
thick, dense atmosphere is composed of 90%
carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps


110
0:12:5,32 --> 0:12:8,769
heat.


111
0:12:8,769 --> 0:12:10,699
There's something else at work on our planet.


112
0:12:10,699 --> 0:12:17,36
When sunlight bounces off the earth, water
vapor and cloud droplets absorb some of the


113
0:12:17,36 --> 0:12:25,4
energy in the infrared portion of the spectrum,
transferring it to the rest of the atmosphere.


114
0:12:25,4 --> 0:12:30,32
You can see it in this satellite image showing
outgoing heat. The most heat escapes from


115
0:12:30,32 --> 0:12:38,589
the tropics, where the surface is warmer and
there are fewer clouds.


116
0:12:38,589 --> 0:12:44,82
And yet, a recent NASA study predicted that
if water vapor were the only greenhouse gas,


117
0:12:44,82 --> 0:12:52,79
temperatures would fall, sending Earth into
an icebound state.


118
0:12:52,79 --> 0:12:58,19
Something is needed to act as a thermostat,
a control knob, to keep the climate steady.


119
0:12:58,19 --> 0:13:7,44
Though it's only .038% of the atmosphere,
carbon dioxide absorbs enough energy to prop


120
0:13:7,44 --> 0:13:13,89
up global temperatures and allow water to
remain in the atmosphere.


121
0:13:13,89 --> 0:13:25,339
But the Earth did not come gift wrapped with
this balance of CO2.


122
0:13:25,339 --> 0:13:33,899
In its early days, the Earth would have released
enormous amounts of heat from its core. That


123
0:13:33,899 --> 0:13:47,16
drove the eruption of volcanoes and the release
of huge volumes of CO2 and other chemicals.


124
0:13:47,16 --> 0:13:53,62
In time, some CO2 was removed by chemical
reactions between silicate rocks and water,


125
0:13:53,62 --> 0:13:59,97
a process called weathering, and washed into
the sea.


126
0:13:59,97 --> 0:14:3,389
Another crucial factor came into play.


127
0:14:3,389 --> 0:14:8,91
Down at the margins of hydrothermal vents,
organic molecules gave rise to primitive life


128
0:14:8,91 --> 0:14:13,5
forms known as prokaryotes.


129
0:14:13,5 --> 0:14:20,19
Other primitive forms evolved with the ability
to take in carbon dioxide and emit oxygen


130
0:14:20,19 --> 0:14:25,5
in the process of photosynthesis.


131
0:14:25,5 --> 0:14:30,339
The ability to cycle carbon in and out of
the atmosphere is perhaps the highest bar


132
0:14:30,339 --> 0:14:37,79
that an alien planet must reach to be called
earth-like.


133
0:14:37,79 --> 0:14:42,519
So far, the closest we've come to that is
a planet called Gliese 581G.


134
0:14:42,519 --> 0:14:49,73
Though its presence is in dispute, the initial
read says it's three to four times the mass


135
0:14:49,73 --> 0:14:56,36
of Earth, and located squarely in its star's
habitable zone based on temperature.


136
0:14:56,36 --> 0:15:4,69
Has Nature crafted a life-bearing gem in this
distant solar system?


137
0:15:4,69 --> 0:15:11,769
Because Gliese 581 is so dim, its habitable
zone is well inside the orbit of our Mercury.


138
0:15:11,769 --> 0:15:17,63
If there is a planet there, the star's gravity
is bound to lock it in place.


139
0:15:17,63 --> 0:15:27,0
This means that Planet G does not rotate.
One side always faces the sun.


140
0:15:27,0 --> 0:15:34,49
In our universe, the rate something spins,
or doesn't spin, is often imprinted at birth.


141
0:15:34,49 --> 0:15:40,81
Our Milky Way, for example, arose in the early
days of our universe, when gravity drew countless


142
0:15:40,81 --> 0:15:47,449
small galaxies together. The galaxy's spin
was determined by the direction and the masses


143
0:15:47,449 --> 0:15:53,389
of all the stars and gas that crashed into
it.


144
0:15:53,389 --> 0:16:3,819
At the center of the galaxy is a supermassive
black hole that rotates once every 17 minutes,


145
0:16:3,819 --> 0:16:8,889
based on the timing of flares on its event
horizon.


146
0:16:8,889 --> 0:16:19,209
The spin record for a neutron star is 1,122
times per second, based on the timing of radio


147
0:16:19,209 --> 0:16:20,3
emissions.


148
0:16:20,3 --> 0:16:29,269
It's like a skater, twirling on the ice. As
she draws her arms in, she spins faster.


149
0:16:29,269 --> 0:16:33,88
Most planets in our solar system spin in a
counter clockwise manner, if you're looking


150
0:16:33,88 --> 0:16:36,319
down on their north poles.


151
0:16:36,319 --> 0:16:41,899
The exceptions are Uranus, with a reverse
spin every 17 hours.


152
0:16:41,899 --> 0:16:50,269
And Venus, once every 243 earth days.


153
0:16:50,269 --> 0:16:56,519
One way to imagine a locked planet is to take
away Earth's rotation.


154
0:16:56,519 --> 0:17:2,949
The planet weighs six billion, trillion tons
and spins at just over a thousand miles per


155
0:17:2,949 --> 0:17:4,89
hour at the equator.


156
0:17:4,89 --> 0:17:11,19
To stop it would take no less than a planetary
collision, of the kind that probably knocked


157
0:17:11,19 --> 0:17:21,78
Uranus and Venus off kilter.


158
0:17:21,78 --> 0:17:36,66
When the dust settled, you'd find a whole
new world.


159
0:17:36,66 --> 0:17:42,7
If you're on the side facing the sun, its
position in the sky never changes.


160
0:17:42,7 --> 0:17:47,92
Without the day night cycle, Earth would loose
the unevenness of solar heating that helps


161
0:17:47,92 --> 0:17:51,59
drive oceanic and atmospheric circulation.


162
0:17:51,59 --> 0:17:56,43
The traditional thinking was that any water
on a locked planet would fall out as snow


163
0:17:56,43 --> 0:17:58,76
on the dark side and be trapped forever.


164
0:17:58,76 --> 0:18:6,54
That thinking changed in the late 1990s when
NASA scientists simulated the atmosphere of


165
0:18:6,54 --> 0:18:12,38
a locked planet. They found that global wind
patterns could develop and transport heat


166
0:18:12,38 --> 0:18:15,86
to the dark side.


167
0:18:15,86 --> 0:18:20,46
Scientists at the California Institute of
Technology sought to test this finding by


168
0:18:20,46 --> 0:18:28,19
turning off Earth's rotation in a supercomputer
program normally used to predict our climate.


169
0:18:28,19 --> 0:18:33,96
The team placed the sub solar point, the region
facing the sun, just off the coast of South


170
0:18:33,96 --> 0:18:34,15
America.


171
0:18:34,15 --> 0:18:43,87
This side view shows the new setup. Evaporation
on the sunny side sends air rising up in storms,


172
0:18:43,87 --> 0:18:46,52
and pushing over the poles to the dark side.


173
0:18:46,52 --> 0:18:54,67
As a result of this pole-ward flow, Alaska
would experience summer all year round.


174
0:18:54,67 --> 0:19:2,54
Landmasses on the dark side, including Europe,
Asia and Africa, would go cold. Remarkably,


175
0:19:2,54 --> 0:19:7,77
over the five decades of the simulation, the
oceans retain enough heat to stay clear of


176
0:19:7,77 --> 0:19:7,98
ice.


177
0:19:7,98 --> 0:19:16,72
On the light side, large parts of the western
hemisphere dry out, turning to desert.


178
0:19:16,72 --> 0:19:24,96
But if you pitch your tent at the sub solar
point, you'd find a hot and rainy climate


179
0:19:24,96 --> 0:19:31,72
that resembles this place... the island of
Kauai in Hawaii.


180
0:19:31,72 --> 0:19:38,68
Its highest point is Mount Waialeale. That's
Hawaiian for Rippling or Overflowing Water.


181
0:19:38,68 --> 0:19:46,22
Known as the rainiest place on Earth, the
summit averages 11 meters of rain per year.


182
0:19:46,22 --> 0:19:56,34
How would a place like this adapt to sunlight
all the time?


183
0:19:56,34 --> 0:20:2,64
Plants depend on light to drive photosynthesis,
a process that combines CO2 with water to


184
0:20:2,64 --> 0:20:4,27
produce sugars needed for growth.


185
0:20:4,27 --> 0:20:13,8
They use the day night cycle to maximize this
process, to tune their growth rates, and take


186
0:20:13,8 --> 0:20:17,69
in more carbon dioxide.


187
0:20:17,69 --> 0:20:22,63
But in polar regions, some plants are known
to thrive in periods of extended sunlight


188
0:20:22,63 --> 0:20:24,75
in summer.


189
0:20:24,75 --> 0:20:30,63
So if you take away the night, the chances
are that life could adapt.


190
0:20:30,63 --> 0:20:36,34
But its ability to do so draws upon hundreds
of millions of years of evolution, in a diverse


191
0:20:36,34 --> 0:20:43,13
global biosphere, dependable day night cycles,
and moderate temperatures.


192
0:20:43,13 --> 0:20:48,32
The question is whether complex plant and
animal life could evolve in the first place


193
0:20:48,32 --> 0:20:49,48
on a locked planet.


194
0:20:49,48 --> 0:21:0,37
Gliese 581G is already a marginal candidate
for life. With its dark and light sides averaged


195
0:21:0,37 --> 0:21:6,41
together, surface temperatures are between
-12 and -31 degrees Celsius.


196
0:21:6,41 --> 0:21:14,37
A team from the University of Chicago sought
to investigate its life-bearing chances, assuming


197
0:21:14,37 --> 0:21:16,38
abundant water and carbon dioxide.


198
0:21:16,38 --> 0:21:24,4
Here's the most promising scenario, called
"Eyeball Earth."


199
0:21:24,4 --> 0:21:31,6
Open ocean at the sub-solar point is surrounded
by ice. The key is to keep the ice at bay,


200
0:21:31,6 --> 0:21:38,32
because it can stifle the exchange of heat
between water and air.


201
0:21:38,32 --> 0:21:42,83
What could tip the balance is the presence
of land... a high amount of weathering at


202
0:21:42,83 --> 0:21:48,7
the sub-solar point could draw too much CO2
from the atmosphere, and turn the planet into


203
0:21:48,7 --> 0:21:49,3
an iceball.


204
0:21:49,3 --> 0:21:58,92
An explorer from a distant Earth would no
doubt head for the transition zone between


205
0:21:58,92 --> 0:22:1,43
ice and open water.


206
0:22:1,43 --> 0:22:7,96
If there's land there, life might have a chance
to thrive in open coastal habitats and perhaps


207
0:22:7,96 --> 0:22:12,62
move from sea to land.


208
0:22:12,62 --> 0:22:21,4
Gliese581G, and other locked planets, are
surely nothing like Earth. And yet time is


209
0:22:21,4 --> 0:22:24,74
on their side.


210
0:22:24,74 --> 0:22:32,82
Our sun was born 5 billion years ago and it
will start to fade in a few billion more.


211
0:22:32,82 --> 0:22:38,92
On the other hand, Red Dwarf stars can burn
steadily for tens, even hundreds of billions


212
0:22:38,92 --> 0:22:41,28
of years.


213
0:22:41,28 --> 0:22:48,27
So with a bit of luck, planet G may have its
day in the sun, if it can spawn primitive


214
0:22:48,27 --> 0:22:52,48
life and somehow shelter its evolution into
more complex forms.


215
0:22:52,48 --> 0:23:2,7
Will we ever find worlds in advanced stages
of development? With the discovery that our


216
0:23:2,7 --> 0:23:8,6
galaxy is likely filled with planets, we are
sure to intensify our search.


217
0:23:8,6 --> 0:23:16,56
One day we may well record a telling chemical
signature or even receive some kind of text


218
0:23:16,56 --> 0:23:16,56
message.


219
0:23:16,56 --> 0:23:26,25
For some on this planet, the news will no
doubt pass overhead... in the headlong rush


220
0:23:26,25 --> 0:23:36,22
of technology, crisis, war, consuming, and
escape.


221
0:23:36,22 --> 0:23:46,2
For others, that day will be filled with humility
and wonder in the knowledge that our world


222
0:23:46,2 --> 0:23:46,77
is not alone.


223
0:23:46,77 --> 0:25:46,77
