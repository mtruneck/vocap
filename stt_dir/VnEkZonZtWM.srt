0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,868
Is it Rachel? Rae.
What've you been up to this week?


2
0:0:2,868 --> 0:0:5,228
It's no wonder I went mental!


3
0:0:5,228 --> 0:0:7,268
I don't think I'm strong enough to
make it on my own.


4
0:0:7,268 --> 0:0:9,388
Why didn't you tell me
you were back?


5
0:0:9,388 --> 0:0:11,511
Come to the pub with me
and the gang.


6
0:0:11,511 --> 0:0:12,911
This is Rae.


7
0:0:12,911 --> 0:0:14,831
Hiya. I'm Archie.


8
0:0:14,831 --> 0:0:23,551
You don't want people thinking
you're weird or not normal.


9
0:0:23,551 --> 0:0:24,751
Dear Diary.


10
0:0:24,751 --> 0:0:26,671
It had been two days since the pool
party,


11
0:0:26,671 --> 0:0:32,671
and still Chloe
hadn't mentioned the hospital tag.


12
0:0:32,671 --> 0:0:39,191
Rae.


13
0:0:39,191 --> 0:0:44,711
'But I had a terrible feeling
that was all about to change.'


14
0:0:44,711 --> 0:0:47,471
Thanks for meeting, sweets.


15
0:0:47,471 --> 0:0:52,711
I just really need to talk to you
about something.


16
0:0:52,711 --> 0:0:56,911
I think I've got a boyfriend.


17
0:0:56,911 --> 0:0:59,231
I thought you wanted to talk about
something serious.


18
0:0:59,231 --> 0:1:2,188
Yeah, well, it is serious, Rae.


19
0:1:2,188 --> 0:1:3,348
Proper serious.


20
0:1:3,348 --> 0:1:5,468
It's not Archie, is it?


21
0:1:5,468 --> 0:1:7,668
No, it's not Archie. It's...


22
0:1:7,668 --> 0:1:10,508
someone who...


23
0:1:10,508 --> 0:1:12,668
Oh, look, I can't tell you, babe.


24
0:1:12,668 --> 0:1:14,428
Not yet.


25
0:1:14,428 --> 0:1:16,628
But I just wanted you to know,


26
0:1:16,628 --> 0:1:23,388
because you're my bessie
and I hate keeping secrets from you.


27
0:1:23,388 --> 0:1:24,668
Well, don't be like that.


28
0:1:24,668 --> 0:1:26,628
Like what?


29
0:1:26,628 --> 0:1:28,188
Rae, you will find a boyfriend.


30
0:1:28,188 --> 0:1:29,708
How?


31
0:1:29,708 --> 0:1:32,108
How will I ever find a boyfriend?


32
0:1:32,108 --> 0:1:35,588
Right, come here, sit down.


33
0:1:35,588 --> 0:1:37,468
Right...


34
0:1:37,468 --> 0:1:40,428
My sister used to be big.


35
0:1:40,428 --> 0:1:42,468
So, I know what this is like.


36
0:1:42,468 --> 0:1:45,708
And I know that boys don't like it.


37
0:1:45,708 --> 0:1:48,148
And it's not right, but...


38
0:1:48,148 --> 0:1:50,68
that's just the way they are.


39
0:1:50,68 --> 0:1:54,28
You know, they think, if they go out
with someone who's big,


40
0:1:54,28 --> 0:1:56,788
then the other lads
will just take the piss.


41
0:1:56,788 --> 0:1:59,708
I'm sorry, but it's the truth.


42
0:1:59,708 --> 0:2:2,588
Yeah? Come here.


43
0:2:2,588 --> 0:2:13,348
Come on! Want a hug.


44
0:2:13,348 --> 0:2:15,428
I am a body dysmorphic


45
0:2:15,428 --> 0:2:18,228
without the dysmorphic.


46
0:2:18,228 --> 0:2:20,68
I am a bulimic...


47
0:2:20,68 --> 0:2:22,828
without the sick.


48
0:2:22,828 --> 0:3:29,71
I am fat.

50
0:4:11,26 --> 0:4:12,106
You all right, Finn?


51
0:4:12,106 --> 0:4:13,706
S'pose.


52
0:4:13,706 --> 0:4:17,586
I'm fine, by the way.


53
0:4:17,586 --> 0:4:18,746
Rae!


54
0:4:18,746 --> 0:4:23,186
'Oh, my God. Archie, the
tyrannosaurus of sexiness,


55
0:4:23,186 --> 0:4:25,426
'was coming to sit next to me.


56
0:4:25,426 --> 0:4:28,666
'I wanted him to treat me like that
little goat in Jurassic Park


57
0:4:28,666 --> 0:4:31,946
'and just eat me whole.'


58
0:4:31,946 --> 0:4:33,959
Save me from this conversation.
Please!


59
0:4:33,959 --> 0:4:35,199
Why?


60
0:4:35,199 --> 0:4:36,679
What's everyone talking about?


61
0:4:36,679 --> 0:4:38,599
Orgasms!


62
0:4:38,599 --> 0:4:41,279
That'd be my specialist subject
on Mastermind.


63
0:4:41,279 --> 0:4:42,719
I've never had an orgasm.


64
0:4:42,719 --> 0:4:44,999
It's exactly the same
as sneezing eight times.


65
0:4:44,999 --> 0:4:46,759
Is it bollocks!


66
0:4:46,759 --> 0:4:49,799
It's true. And when I come,
I come with thunder, pal.


67
0:4:49,799 --> 0:4:52,759
Once you get him out,
the SWAT team can't get him back in.


68
0:4:52,759 --> 0:4:53,919
Oh, aye?!


69
0:4:53,919 --> 0:4:55,559
What about the girls you're doing it
with?


70
0:4:55,559 --> 0:4:56,639
Ask Sam Moffat, mate.


71
0:4:56,639 --> 0:4:59,599
I threw her round that Renault 5
like she was an empty shell suit.


72
0:4:59,599 --> 0:5:1,959
Why d'you have to be such a horrible
boy all the time?


73
0:5:1,959 --> 0:5:3,679
What you doin'? Why? Why?


74
0:5:3,679 --> 0:5:5,959
Chill! Stop hitting me!


75
0:5:5,959 --> 0:5:7,399
It's not nice.


76
0:5:7,399 --> 0:5:9,359
Like, I'm not saying I've done
everything.


77
0:5:9,359 --> 0:5:11,279
Yeah, cheeky!
But, you know, like,


78
0:5:11,279 --> 0:5:13,119
an orgasm's like a gateway.


79
0:5:13,119 --> 0:5:17,799
You can never go back through.
Like, it sets you free as a person.
Doesn't it?


80
0:5:17,799 --> 0:5:24,759
Totally! Yeah!


81
0:5:24,759 --> 0:5:26,759
I've got an idea.


82
0:5:26,759 --> 0:5:28,959
Why don't we all talk about
our best sexual


83
0:5:28,959 --> 0:5:33,79
and romantic experiences?
Great! I'll go first. Listen...


84
0:5:33,79 --> 0:5:45,639
Er, no, Rae... Rae, you go first.


85
0:5:45,639 --> 0:5:48,959
I forgot, I've gotta put the tea
on for my mum. Sorry, guys.


86
0:5:48,959 --> 0:5:51,239
Come on, Rae.
Hey, I'll get you a drink.


87
0:5:51,239 --> 0:5:52,519
No, it's all right.


88
0:5:52,519 --> 0:5:57,39
Come on, you only just got
here. What you making?


89
0:5:57,39 --> 0:5:59,599
'Thanks to Chloe,
it was now clear to everyone


90
0:5:59,599 --> 0:6:5,119
'that I had never done anything
sexual or romantic.


91
0:6:5,119 --> 0:6:8,799
'The 15th of July, 1996.


92
0:6:8,799 --> 0:6:11,439
'Something had to be done.


93
0:6:11,439 --> 0:6:14,879
'One - pass through
the mystical orgasm gateway.


94
0:6:14,879 --> 0:6:17,799
'Two - see someone naked.


95
0:6:17,799 --> 0:6:19,959
'Three - kiss someone.


96
0:6:19,959 --> 0:6:50,279
'Must be human.'


97
0:6:50,279 --> 0:6:51,879
I didn't even see anything.


98
0:6:51,879 --> 0:6:53,119
She saw everything.


99
0:6:53,119 --> 0:6:56,239
Rae, did you see Mrs Dewhurst's...
credentials?


100
0:6:56,239 --> 0:6:57,799
She's always peeping.


101
0:6:57,799 --> 0:6:58,879
I didn't peep. You did.


102
0:6:58,879 --> 0:7:0,279
Were you staring at her? No!


103
0:7:0,279 --> 0:7:2,399
I opened the curtains,
and she was standing there...


104
0:7:2,399 --> 0:7:3,519
Oh, I beg your pardon... naked.


105
0:7:3,519 --> 0:7:4,839
I'm very sorry.


106
0:7:4,839 --> 0:7:7,359
You were. Fed up with it!


107
0:7:7,359 --> 0:7:11,519
Why would I peep?
What is there to even peep at?


108
0:7:11,519 --> 0:7:12,799
Rae, be quiet!


109
0:7:12,799 --> 0:7:13,839
'It was typical.


110
0:7:13,839 --> 0:7:17,479
'The first time I catch a glimpse
of another person's bits


111
0:7:17,479 --> 0:7:20,159
'and it's my 76-year-old
neighbour's.


112
0:7:20,159 --> 0:7:22,719
'A romantic milestone
burnt into my retinas.'


113
0:7:22,719 --> 0:7:24,399
Right.


114
0:7:24,399 --> 0:7:27,479
First off, Rae isn't gonna peep any
more.


115
0:7:27,479 --> 0:7:33,199
But I didn't peep! Just...!


116
0:7:33,199 --> 0:7:36,799
Second off,
she'll run a few errands for you


117
0:7:36,799 --> 0:7:47,399
to apologise for any embarrassment -
how's that?


118
0:7:47,399 --> 0:7:51,799
'Living in the totalitarian state of
Mum was worse than being in prison.


119
0:7:51,799 --> 0:7:54,759
'At least there are laws
to protect prisoners.


120
0:7:54,759 --> 0:8:0,839
'Any kind of human right I am
entitled to is always swept away
by one single phrase.'


121
0:8:0,839 --> 0:8:3,919
And don't pull that face at me,
Rachel Earl.


122
0:8:3,919 --> 0:8:28,159
So long as you live under my roof,
you live by my rules.


123
0:8:28,159 --> 0:8:30,479
My mum's in a sham relationship.


124
0:8:30,479 --> 0:8:32,159
She's going out with this guy.


125
0:8:32,159 --> 0:8:34,839
And he's like...


126
0:8:34,839 --> 0:8:36,999
handsome and fit and stuff.


127
0:8:36,999 --> 0:8:39,39
But she...


128
0:8:39,39 --> 0:8:42,319
she's like me.


129
0:8:42,319 --> 0:8:43,519
She's a blob.


130
0:8:43,519 --> 0:8:45,279
A blob with a gob.


131
0:8:45,279 --> 0:8:47,239
Is that how you see yourself?


132
0:8:47,239 --> 0:8:48,799
It's how I am.


133
0:8:48,799 --> 0:8:54,79
Tell me some things
that you like about yourself.


134
0:8:54,79 --> 0:8:56,879
Anything.


135
0:8:56,879 --> 0:8:59,279
I can't think of anything.


136
0:8:59,279 --> 0:9:2,439
All right, if I was to ask one of
your friends what they liked
about you,


137
0:9:2,439 --> 0:9:4,119
what do you think they would say?


138
0:9:4,119 --> 0:9:5,399
They would say...


139
0:9:5,399 --> 0:9:11,359
"What the bloody hell
are you asking me that for?"


140
0:9:11,359 --> 0:9:13,839
I've noticed that every time
you come into this room,


141
0:9:13,839 --> 0:9:17,119
you take the longer way round
to that chair.


142
0:9:17,119 --> 0:9:20,759
I thought maybe you're trying
to avoid that mirror over there.


143
0:9:20,759 --> 0:9:24,519
Ooh! Maybe you should open
a detective agency.


144
0:9:24,519 --> 0:9:27,759
Yeah, maybe I should.


145
0:9:27,759 --> 0:9:30,879
Hardly anyone likes
looking in a mirror.


146
0:9:30,879 --> 0:9:35,119
In fact, no-one likes
looking in a mirror.


147
0:9:35,119 --> 0:9:36,719
You know what, Rae?


148
0:9:36,719 --> 0:9:39,999
I'm 47 years old
and I still get blackheads.


149
0:9:39,999 --> 0:9:41,639
I've got bags under my eyes


150
0:9:41,639 --> 0:9:46,319
that make me look like I've battled
a lifelong addiction to heroin.


151
0:9:46,319 --> 0:9:47,959
But having said that,


152
0:9:47,959 --> 0:9:50,879
I do look fantastic.


153
0:9:50,879 --> 0:9:52,399
Yeah, I look great.


154
0:9:52,399 --> 0:9:54,239
You know what?


155
0:9:54,239 --> 0:9:56,439
Perfect wouldn't be a stretch too
far.


156
0:9:56,439 --> 0:10:1,159
I think I look perfect.


157
0:10:1,159 --> 0:10:3,159
Are you trying to make me hate you?


158
0:10:3,159 --> 0:10:6,599
I want you to make it your mission
to look in a mirror every day.


159
0:10:6,599 --> 0:10:8,959
And no matter how many things you
see that you don't like,


160
0:10:8,959 --> 0:10:11,239
I want you to say something positive
about yourself.


161
0:10:11,239 --> 0:10:16,559
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.


162
0:10:16,559 --> 0:10:19,599
Do you know what? It's just weird.


163
0:10:19,599 --> 0:10:21,599
Is it more or less weird...


164
0:10:21,599 --> 0:10:24,199
than being physically unable
to look at your own reflection?


165
0:10:24,199 --> 0:10:25,359
I'm not doing it.


166
0:10:25,359 --> 0:10:27,679
All I'm asking is that you
try your...


167
0:10:27,679 --> 0:10:33,879
I'm not fucking doing it.


168
0:10:33,879 --> 0:10:35,919
What do you like about me?


169
0:10:35,919 --> 0:10:37,639
I like everything about you.


170
0:10:37,639 --> 0:10:38,919
Mmm.


171
0:10:38,919 --> 0:10:42,119
Be more specific.


172
0:10:42,119 --> 0:10:43,159
I can't.


173
0:10:43,159 --> 0:10:45,319
There's nothing I don't like about
you.


174
0:10:45,319 --> 0:10:48,559
You're lovely...


175
0:10:48,559 --> 0:10:50,479
but unhelpful.


176
0:10:50,479 --> 0:10:52,599
Tix!


177
0:10:52,599 --> 0:10:54,119
Danny.


178
0:10:54,119 --> 0:10:55,799
What?


179
0:10:55,799 --> 0:11:0,39
Danny, let go of her arm.


180
0:11:0,39 --> 0:11:3,479
Agh! Stop it. Agh! Tix, stop.


181
0:11:3,479 --> 0:11:4,519
Agh!


182
0:11:4,519 --> 0:11:7,479
Tix, stop it. Agh! Agh, Tix!


183
0:11:7,479 --> 0:11:9,79
Agh! Stop it. Sorry, Tix. Agh!


184
0:11:9,79 --> 0:11:13,999
Tix, I said I'm sorry, Tix.
I forgot. Tix, I'm sorry.


185
0:11:13,999 --> 0:11:15,839
No! No-one touch her.


186
0:11:15,839 --> 0:11:19,79
Danny, just let go of her arms.


187
0:11:19,79 --> 0:11:31,399
But she'll hit me again.
She won't. Just stop touching her.


188
0:11:31,399 --> 0:11:32,599
Tixy.


189
0:11:32,599 --> 0:11:36,719
'Broken people fall to bits
sometimes. That's what they do.


190
0:11:36,719 --> 0:11:38,159
'But I'm not broken.'


191
0:11:38,159 --> 0:11:39,639
It's all right.


192
0:11:39,639 --> 0:11:40,799
'Not any more.'


193
0:11:40,799 --> 0:11:47,147
It's all right. It's all right.


194
0:11:47,147 --> 0:11:50,587
Why did she look at me like that
when she gave me my prescription?


195
0:11:50,587 --> 0:11:53,547
Like, it's just the pill -
it's no big deal.


196
0:11:53,547 --> 0:11:55,987
I think she looks at everyone like
that.


197
0:11:55,987 --> 0:11:58,257
I once bought a whistling lollipop
from there, and she looked at me


198
0:11:58,257 --> 0:12:0,497
like I'd farted
in an empty bag of Monster Munch


199
0:12:0,497 --> 0:12:2,17
and just squashed it in her face.


200
0:12:2,17 --> 0:12:6,177
Nah, it's because it was
the pill. I know it.


201
0:12:6,177 --> 0:12:8,857
I can't believe
I'm gonna be doing it, Rae.


202
0:12:8,857 --> 0:12:10,577
This weekend!


203
0:12:10,577 --> 0:12:11,657
Shit!


204
0:12:11,657 --> 0:12:14,57
Shit.


205
0:12:14,57 --> 0:12:16,697
So, are we gonna talk
about the pool party?


206
0:12:16,697 --> 0:12:18,937
What about the pool party?


207
0:12:18,937 --> 0:12:22,297
Well, I found that
hospital tag thing.


208
0:12:22,297 --> 0:12:28,377
'I wished for the ground to
swallow me up, for a piano to
fall from the heavens


209
0:12:28,377 --> 0:12:30,537
'and crush Chloe deep
into the earth.


210
0:12:30,537 --> 0:12:47,697
'But the weird thing was, something
even more incredible happened.'


211
0:12:47,697 --> 0:12:49,897
- Ay, ay.
- Hi, Archie.


212
0:12:49,897 --> 0:12:54,97
Hi. Rae, I wanted to talk to you
at the boozer last night, but you
left before I could speak to you.


213
0:12:54,97 --> 0:12:55,897
I just, er, wanted to know


214
0:12:55,897 --> 0:12:58,977
if you wanted to come out for a
drink with me tomorrow night.


215
0:12:58,977 --> 0:13:0,57
Just me and you.


216
0:13:0,57 --> 0:13:2,577
'Wasn't expecting that!


217
0:13:2,577 --> 0:13:4,377
'What to say?'


218
0:13:4,377 --> 0:13:5,897
'Yeah? Fuck yeah?


219
0:13:5,897 --> 0:13:7,857
'A thousand fucks yeah?!'


220
0:13:7,857 --> 0:13:9,17
Is that a yes or a no?


221
0:13:9,17 --> 0:13:12,17
Yeah.


222
0:13:12,17 --> 0:13:13,577
Why not?


223
0:13:13,577 --> 0:13:34,937
Cool. All right, I'll... I'll meet
you at The Swan at eightish.


224
0:13:34,937 --> 0:13:37,417
When are you allowed back to the
ward?


225
0:13:37,417 --> 0:13:42,657
Kester says I have to
prove to him that I'm not gonna
freak out again.


226
0:13:42,657 --> 0:13:44,297
Let's talk about something else.


227
0:13:44,297 --> 0:13:46,337
So, tell me about Archie.


228
0:13:46,337 --> 0:13:48,497
Well...


229
0:13:48,497 --> 0:13:51,657
he's an Aries, which is perfect,
because I'm a Sagittarius.


230
0:13:51,657 --> 0:13:53,57
And he prefers Oasis to Blur,


231
0:13:53,57 --> 0:13:54,977
but he quite liked Parklife


232
0:13:54,977 --> 0:13:58,177
because it reminded him of this
holiday that he had in Corfu.


233
0:13:58,177 --> 0:14:0,457
And he wants to study history
at university,


234
0:14:0,457 --> 0:14:2,537
cos he wants to be, like, a
historian.


235
0:14:2,537 --> 0:14:4,817
And he's always coming out
with these amazing quotes


236
0:14:4,817 --> 0:14:7,137
from, like, Alexander the Great and
stuff.


237
0:14:7,137 --> 0:14:8,737
Tix, this could be it.


238
0:14:8,737 --> 0:14:13,57
This could be the real thing.


239
0:14:13,57 --> 0:14:17,377
I would be nervous about it, though.
Boys move pretty fast, don't they?


240
0:14:17,377 --> 0:14:18,737
He might want to touch you.


241
0:14:18,737 --> 0:14:19,777
Er...


242
0:14:19,777 --> 0:14:23,457
Tix, are you forgetting
that I really want him to?


243
0:14:23,457 --> 0:14:26,137
Well, yeah, but think about it.


244
0:14:26,137 --> 0:14:28,257
You could be naked
in front of each other tonight.


245
0:14:28,257 --> 0:14:30,177
You could be looking at him naked,


246
0:14:30,177 --> 0:14:33,17
thinking, "What do I do now?"


247
0:14:33,17 --> 0:14:36,457
"What do I do with... that?


248
0:14:36,457 --> 0:14:40,577
"What if I do something to it
that he doesn't like?"


249
0:14:40,577 --> 0:14:43,657
And that's not forgetting the fact
that you'll be naked.


250
0:14:43,657 --> 0:14:50,697
I would be bricking it, Rae.
Aren't you bricking it?


251
0:14:50,697 --> 0:14:54,97
Oh, my God!


252
0:14:54,97 --> 0:14:58,177
'Bollocks to looking in a mirror
and whispering sweet nothings to
myself.


253
0:14:58,177 --> 0:15:0,497
'If I wanted Archie to touch me,


254
0:15:0,497 --> 0:15:10,257
'it was imperative there was a lot
less of me to touch.'


255
0:15:10,257 --> 0:15:12,577
'Oh, Christ!


256
0:15:12,577 --> 0:15:21,577
'I'm the tyrannosaurus of sex.'


257
0:15:21,577 --> 0:15:24,537
Ahh!


258
0:15:24,537 --> 0:15:25,577
Clever girl!


259
0:15:25,577 --> 0:15:31,737
Ah! Ahh!


260
0:15:31,737 --> 0:15:41,257
'Something must be done.'


261
0:15:41,257 --> 0:15:46,817
'Only one album
would get my fat arse moving.


262
0:15:46,817 --> 0:15:57,177
'It was time for greatness.'


263
0:15:57,177 --> 0:16:3,417
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13...


264
0:16:3,417 --> 0:16:6,57
18, 19...


265
0:16:6,57 --> 0:16:38,97
21, 22, 23...


266
0:16:38,97 --> 0:16:39,577
Oi!


267
0:16:39,577 --> 0:16:41,737
Jabba the jogger!


268
0:16:41,737 --> 0:16:44,817
God! Jabba!


269
0:16:44,817 --> 0:16:46,217
Jabba the jogger!


270
0:16:46,217 --> 0:16:58,457
Oi, Jabba jogger!


271
0:16:58,457 --> 0:17:10,297
Bollocks.


272
0:17:10,297 --> 0:17:17,657
'Argh! How can I weigh more?'


273
0:17:17,657 --> 0:17:19,137
Mum?


274
0:17:19,137 --> 0:17:23,297
Sit down, Rachel.


275
0:17:23,297 --> 0:17:25,57
Stamford...


276
0:17:25,57 --> 0:17:27,657
is a small town, Rae.


277
0:17:27,657 --> 0:17:30,857
People talk.


278
0:17:30,857 --> 0:17:35,257
Have you got something
that you want to tell me?


279
0:17:35,257 --> 0:17:36,297
No.


280
0:17:36,297 --> 0:17:41,737
Not even in regards...


281
0:17:41,737 --> 0:17:44,377
this?


282
0:17:44,377 --> 0:17:47,537
That's for my mum.


283
0:17:47,537 --> 0:17:49,497
Not even in regards...


284
0:17:49,497 --> 0:17:53,457
these.


285
0:17:53,457 --> 0:17:56,977
Don't look at me! They're for my
mum.


286
0:17:56,977 --> 0:18:1,337
It's not even that
you're spreading rumours


287
0:18:1,337 --> 0:18:4,577
that I'm some kind of sex maniac.


288
0:18:4,577 --> 0:18:9,937
It's that to be a sex maniac,
you have to have a man.


289
0:18:9,937 --> 0:18:16,17
And as the man I've got is currently
on the run from Immigration,


290
0:18:16,17 --> 0:18:18,697
it's not something
I want spread around town.


291
0:18:18,697 --> 0:18:19,777
I, erm...


292
0:18:19,777 --> 0:18:21,577
It's not just those things.


293
0:18:21,577 --> 0:18:24,417
It's the fact...


294
0:18:24,417 --> 0:18:28,97
that I come home after a long day


295
0:18:28,97 --> 0:18:31,377
cleaning up the sick... and the piss


296
0:18:31,377 --> 0:18:35,417
of the infirmed and
injured, to find...


297
0:18:35,417 --> 0:18:38,457
that you have thrown away


298
0:18:38,457 --> 0:18:42,577
£35-worth of confectionery


299
0:18:42,577 --> 0:18:48,257
for no reason!


300
0:18:48,257 --> 0:18:49,337
I, er...


301
0:18:49,337 --> 0:18:51,417
Shush!


302
0:18:51,417 --> 0:18:54,57
I don't know what
game you're playing at,


303
0:18:54,57 --> 0:18:57,417
but you're grounded for 24 hours,


304
0:18:57,417 --> 0:18:59,417
effective immediately.


305
0:18:59,417 --> 0:19:1,297
I can't! I'm meeting some...


306
0:19:1,297 --> 0:19:14,897
Put... your keys... on... the table!


307
0:19:14,897 --> 0:19:18,417
'He's waiting for me. He's waiting
for me!


308
0:19:18,417 --> 0:19:21,337
'And some skinny bitch will see him
all alone at the bar,


309
0:19:21,337 --> 0:19:23,857
'dry his tears and shag him in the
toilets.


310
0:19:23,857 --> 0:19:45,577
'Arrgh!'


311
0:19:45,577 --> 0:19:48,377
All right, I'm coming!


312
0:19:48,377 --> 0:19:49,897
Archie?


313
0:19:49,897 --> 0:19:53,377
I'm wearing a towelling rainbow.
I look like a tube of toothpaste.


314
0:19:53,377 --> 0:19:54,697
Rae, what happened?


315
0:19:54,697 --> 0:19:58,17
I'm really sorry, Archie.
My mum wouldn't let me come out.


316
0:19:58,17 --> 0:19:59,297
Why?


317
0:19:59,297 --> 0:20:4,297
Cos I threw away
a few of her chocolate bars.


318
0:20:4,297 --> 0:20:7,537
Let's go out now. I won't tell her.


319
0:20:7,537 --> 0:20:9,57
I dunno.


320
0:20:9,57 --> 0:20:11,17
She knows everyone in Stamford.


321
0:20:11,17 --> 0:20:13,777
If we go to the pub, she'll only
find out.


322
0:20:13,777 --> 0:20:18,817
I know somewhere else we can go.


323
0:20:18,817 --> 0:20:21,377
All right. Wait here.


324
0:20:21,377 --> 0:20:22,377
Two minutes.


325
0:20:22,377 --> 0:20:25,737
- OK.
- All right.


326
0:20:25,737 --> 0:20:30,377
There aren't many good things about
working early shifts at a leisure
centre.


327
0:20:30,377 --> 0:20:34,217
Oh.


328
0:20:34,217 --> 0:21:6,497
But there are some.


329
0:21:6,497 --> 0:21:9,97
'Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can't hear a
thing.


330
0:21:9,97 --> 0:21:11,777
'Just keep that pretty mouth
moving.'


331
0:21:11,777 --> 0:21:13,777
that was really
what put an end to the sport.


332
0:21:13,777 --> 0:21:16,137
If it hadn't have been for that,
maybe we'd have...


333
0:21:16,137 --> 0:21:18,777
jousting areas in leisure centres
all over Britain, eh?


334
0:21:18,777 --> 0:21:22,817
Yeah.


335
0:21:22,817 --> 0:21:24,217
Am I being boring again?


336
0:21:24,217 --> 0:21:26,217
No.


337
0:21:26,217 --> 0:21:39,337
I like listening to you talk about
stuff.


338
0:21:39,337 --> 0:21:42,257
'It was incredible
what Archie's tongue felt like -


339
0:21:42,257 --> 0:21:47,97
'like a small, warm animal
darting round inside my mouth.


340
0:21:47,97 --> 0:21:50,297
'In that one kiss, I was so free.


341
0:21:50,297 --> 0:21:53,257
'Free of people telling me what to
do.


342
0:21:53,257 --> 0:21:56,17
'Free of hospitals.'


343
0:21:56,17 --> 0:22:0,777
'Free of myself.'


344
0:22:0,777 --> 0:22:2,297
Archie.


345
0:22:2,297 --> 0:22:4,137
Your hand is on my boob?


346
0:22:4,137 --> 0:22:6,337
Does it feel good?


347
0:22:6,337 --> 0:22:10,817
Yeah, it's all right.


348
0:22:10,817 --> 0:22:11,937
Cool.


349
0:22:11,937 --> 0:22:21,537
Yeah.


350
0:22:21,537 --> 0:22:23,817
Will you be allowed out tomorrow?


351
0:22:23,817 --> 0:22:26,377
Yeah. I'm on parole tomorrow.


352
0:22:26,377 --> 0:22:30,897
Well, if you can, meet me tomorrow
evening for tea in the cafe outside
the cinema.


353
0:22:30,897 --> 0:22:36,537
Er, my parents
are away at the moment, so, er...


354
0:22:36,537 --> 0:22:46,417
Well... Afterwards,
maybe we could go back to mine.


355
0:22:46,417 --> 0:23:5,566
See ya.


356
0:23:5,566 --> 0:23:7,486
It was too good to be true.


357
0:23:7,486 --> 0:23:13,975
If it wasn't for the fact that
I found two new spots,
I'd think I was dreaming.


358
0:23:13,975 --> 0:23:15,215
Someone likes me.


359
0:23:15,215 --> 0:23:17,24
Not just someone.


360
0:23:17,24 --> 0:23:21,184
Archie, the professor of horn,
likes me.


361
0:23:21,184 --> 0:23:40,344
I don't get it, but I love, love,
love it!


362
0:23:40,344 --> 0:23:41,464
Rae!


363
0:23:41,464 --> 0:23:44,304
Oh, guess who I've just been
speaking to.


364
0:23:44,304 --> 0:23:46,264
Who? Mrs Dewhurst.


365
0:23:46,264 --> 0:23:50,198
Guess who she saw coming
in at one o'clock in the
morning with a boy last night.


366
0:23:50,198 --> 0:23:51,192
Who?


367
0:23:51,192 --> 0:23:53,832
I don't know when you thought
that going out with a boy


368
0:23:53,832 --> 0:23:56,32
and doing God knows what
till God knows when...


369
0:23:56,32 --> 0:23:59,912
Why is it all right for you to have
a boyfriend but not for me?


370
0:23:59,912 --> 0:24:2,392
I've gotta put up with Karim
every bloody day.


371
0:24:2,392 --> 0:24:4,672
Get in there.


372
0:24:4,672 --> 0:24:9,32
Get in.


373
0:24:9,32 --> 0:24:11,712
Right, what is wrong with Karim?


374
0:24:11,712 --> 0:24:14,512
He's constantly in a state
of semi-nudity.


375
0:24:14,512 --> 0:24:15,872
Why is he even here?


376
0:24:15,872 --> 0:24:17,992
Why's he going out with you?


377
0:24:17,992 --> 0:24:20,112
I just don't get it.


378
0:24:20,112 --> 0:24:22,712
There's nothing to get.
He loves me.


379
0:24:22,712 --> 0:24:24,672
Fair enough.


380
0:24:24,672 --> 0:24:28,232
D'you know what? I am sick to
the back teeth of you taking
the piss out of me.


381
0:24:28,232 --> 0:24:29,952
I'm your mum.


382
0:24:29,952 --> 0:24:34,832
Not your school friend,
not your sister. Your mum.


383
0:24:34,832 --> 0:24:38,232
Are we done? No, we're not done.
You're grounded.


384
0:24:38,232 --> 0:24:40,912
Not just for today.
Not just for tomorrow.


385
0:24:40,912 --> 0:24:43,112
But for forever, until I say stop.


386
0:24:43,112 --> 0:24:44,992
You can't do that.


387
0:24:44,992 --> 0:24:48,712
I can do that, cos this is my house
and you're living...


388
0:24:48,712 --> 0:24:53,912
Yeah, it might be your house and
I might live under your roof,


389
0:24:53,912 --> 0:24:56,272
but you're not grounding me.


390
0:24:56,272 --> 0:25:2,72
End of.


391
0:25:2,72 --> 0:25:5,112
Three weeks ago, Rae,


392
0:25:5,112 --> 0:25:8,992
you were in a psychiatric ward.


393
0:25:8,992 --> 0:25:12,152
It's my job to keep
an eye on you,


394
0:25:12,152 --> 0:25:15,352
to make sure you don't do too much,
too soon,


395
0:25:15,352 --> 0:25:20,712
to make sure you don't
break again.


396
0:25:20,712 --> 0:25:24,312
But d'you know what? Fine.


397
0:25:24,312 --> 0:25:27,672
You obviously know
better than me.


398
0:25:27,672 --> 0:25:44,832
Do what you want.


399
0:25:44,832 --> 0:25:47,232
Chop, you are talking
absolute bollocks.


400
0:25:47,232 --> 0:25:49,512
Orgasms are mint.


401
0:25:49,512 --> 0:25:50,632
A sneeze isn't even nice.


402
0:25:50,632 --> 0:25:53,112
How can eight of 'em be an
orgasm? It doesn't make sense.


403
0:25:53,112 --> 0:25:56,192
It's pound for pound.
It has the same physical impact.


404
0:25:56,192 --> 0:25:57,712
I read it in a textbook,
all right?


405
0:25:57,712 --> 0:25:59,472
So, just drop it.
Prove it.


406
0:25:59,472 --> 0:26:1,192
All right, I will do.
Go on.


407
0:26:1,192 --> 0:26:4,312
No, rack up a line of that pepper
and see if you can snort it. Go on.


408
0:26:4,312 --> 0:26:5,352
That one there? Aye.


409
0:26:5,352 --> 0:26:6,832
All right, I'll do it right now.
Get it right up your nose.


410
0:26:6,832 --> 0:26:8,672
Watch me go. Rae!


411
0:26:8,672 --> 0:26:11,712
I'll give you a fiver...
How was your date with Archie?


412
0:26:11,712 --> 0:26:14,352
Tell me everything!


413
0:26:14,352 --> 0:26:18,272
You didn't let him touch your lady
parts, did you, Raemundo?


414
0:26:18,272 --> 0:26:20,192
What are you doing?
No, nothing happened.


415
0:26:20,192 --> 0:26:23,592
I told you nothing'd happen.
Yeah... nothing happened.


416
0:26:23,592 --> 0:26:25,712
We did have a bit of a kiss,
though.


417
0:26:25,712 --> 0:26:27,72
Oh!


418
0:26:27,72 --> 0:26:30,552
Go on! You two are so perfect
for each other.


419
0:26:30,552 --> 0:26:33,192
Raemundo, you saucy little
tartlet, you!


420
0:26:33,192 --> 0:26:36,552
You little raring tiger!
Get out of it! Go on!


421
0:26:36,552 --> 0:26:39,432
Chop! It was only a kiss!


422
0:26:39,432 --> 0:26:40,912
Bollocks to that.


423
0:26:40,912 --> 0:26:43,792
Your faces totally had sex
with each other.Right.


424
0:26:43,792 --> 0:26:45,872
It was kinda cool.


425
0:26:45,872 --> 0:26:49,272
But... big deal. So we kissed.


426
0:26:49,272 --> 0:26:51,592
I can't believe
you're so chilled about it.


427
0:26:51,592 --> 0:26:53,792
Well, you know...
But, Izzy, it was so...


428
0:26:53,792 --> 0:26:56,992
Girls, I need to talk to you.


429
0:26:56,992 --> 0:26:58,192
Toilets.


430
0:26:58,192 --> 0:27:1,232
Now!


431
0:27:1,232 --> 0:27:3,32
Is that big enough, that?
Here y'are.


432
0:27:3,32 --> 0:27:5,32
That's big enough, that.
Have a bit more, mate. Go on.


433
0:27:5,32 --> 0:27:6,272
I had sex last night!


434
0:27:6,272 --> 0:27:8,592
Oh, yay! Oh, my God!


435
0:27:8,592 --> 0:27:10,352
What was it like?


436
0:27:10,352 --> 0:27:13,112
Who was it with?
Oh, I'm sorry, babe.


437
0:27:13,112 --> 0:27:14,912
I still can't tell you who he is.
Yeah, yeah.


438
0:27:14,912 --> 0:27:16,72
It's just... Totally.


439
0:27:16,72 --> 0:27:19,432
You know, we just want
everything not to be in the
public domain at the moment.


440
0:27:19,432 --> 0:27:21,952
You know? Yeah.


441
0:27:21,952 --> 0:27:26,272
Oh, it was perfect. Got to
his house about half-eight-ish.


442
0:27:26,272 --> 0:27:29,32
He only lives
in a sodding barn conversion!


443
0:27:29,32 --> 0:27:30,872
Oh, my God!
I know!


444
0:27:30,872 --> 0:27:33,432
So, when I got there, we had,
like, a little bit of dinner.


445
0:27:33,432 --> 0:27:35,472
What did you eat?
Just a sandwich.


446
0:27:35,472 --> 0:27:36,712
He made you a sandwich? Yeah.


447
0:27:36,712 --> 0:27:38,992
Well, what kind of sandwich?
Well, cheese and Branston.


448
0:27:38,992 --> 0:27:40,472
Ohh... And anyway,


449
0:27:40,472 --> 0:27:42,792
he only goes and sticks on
the Phil Collins album.


450
0:27:42,792 --> 0:27:45,152
Oh!
Which Phil Collins album?


451
0:27:45,152 --> 0:27:47,192
Well, the one with Coming In
The Air Tonight on it. Obviously!


452
0:27:47,192 --> 0:27:48,472
Face Value? Yeah.


453
0:27:48,472 --> 0:27:50,272
Oh, yeah.
I think so.


454
0:27:50,272 --> 0:27:51,512
Doesn't matter anyway.


455
0:27:51,512 --> 0:27:55,472
Because we were only
halfway through the first song
when he took me upstairs.


456
0:27:55,472 --> 0:27:56,872
What was his bedroom like?


457
0:27:56,872 --> 0:27:58,592
Yeah, he was a bit weird
about taking me in there...


458
0:27:58,592 --> 0:28:0,192
so he laid me out


459
0:28:0,192 --> 0:28:2,952
on a towel on the landing...


460
0:28:2,952 --> 0:28:5,312
in front of the airing cupboard.


461
0:28:5,312 --> 0:28:6,712
And, well...


462
0:28:6,712 --> 0:28:11,592
you know the rest.


463
0:28:11,592 --> 0:28:13,72
Classic Chloe.


464
0:28:13,72 --> 0:28:14,352
Rae!


465
0:28:14,352 --> 0:28:15,792
Tell Chloe your news.


466
0:28:15,792 --> 0:28:19,352
Well, no, it's nothing
compared to...


467
0:28:19,352 --> 0:28:22,272
I kissed Archie last night.


468
0:28:22,272 --> 0:28:23,752
Oh, my God!


469
0:28:23,752 --> 0:28:24,952
How?


470
0:28:24,952 --> 0:28:27,712
Well, we just put
our faces together.


471
0:28:27,712 --> 0:28:29,32
Obviously!


472
0:28:29,32 --> 0:28:30,672
It turns out he proper fancies me.


473
0:28:30,672 --> 0:28:33,872
Ohhh!
You know what? Archie's really hot.


474
0:28:33,872 --> 0:28:35,352
Yeah. Correct.


475
0:28:35,352 --> 0:28:37,32
Yeah.


476
0:28:37,32 --> 0:28:39,752
So, what else happened?


477
0:28:39,752 --> 0:28:44,272
Well, there was a bit of touching
when we was kissin'!


478
0:28:44,272 --> 0:28:45,632
As standard, you know? Yeah!


479
0:28:45,632 --> 0:28:48,792
What else?


480
0:28:48,792 --> 0:28:50,192
He fingered me eight times.


481
0:28:50,192 --> 0:28:51,712
Yay! What?!


482
0:28:51,712 --> 0:28:52,792
Shit.


483
0:28:52,792 --> 0:28:54,472
Fucking hell, Rae.


484
0:28:54,472 --> 0:28:56,192
Yeah. Under your jeans?


485
0:28:56,192 --> 0:28:57,232
Over my jeans.


486
0:28:57,232 --> 0:28:59,112
Oh, that still counts.


487
0:28:59,112 --> 0:29:1,112
Totally still counts.
Oh, my God.


488
0:29:1,112 --> 0:29:2,832
Yeah! That's so good.


489
0:29:2,832 --> 0:29:5,592
And, er, well,
we're going on another date tonight.


490
0:29:5,592 --> 0:29:6,632
Really? Yeah.


491
0:29:6,632 --> 0:29:10,312
His parents are away, so, um,
I'm...


492
0:29:10,312 --> 0:29:12,352
probably gonna be doing it.


493
0:29:12,352 --> 0:29:17,672
Holy shit, Rae!
Are you ready for that?


494
0:29:17,672 --> 0:29:19,32
We should do a makeover!


495
0:29:19,32 --> 0:29:20,312
Definitely a makeover.


496
0:29:20,312 --> 0:29:22,832
Pleeease!
No, no, no, no. I don't do makeovers.


497
0:29:22,832 --> 0:29:24,352
That's not me. No.
Er, well, you do now.


498
0:29:24,352 --> 0:29:26,352
So, listen to me. OK?


499
0:29:26,352 --> 0:29:29,512
This is not just a kiss
and a bit of a grope.


500
0:29:29,512 --> 0:29:30,952
It's more than a grope.Exactly.


501
0:29:30,952 --> 0:29:32,312
So, think.


502
0:29:32,312 --> 0:29:34,72
Think, Rae. Think...


503
0:29:34,72 --> 0:29:35,992
of how hot Archie is.


504
0:29:35,992 --> 0:29:37,592
Yeah.
Right? Yeah.


505
0:29:37,592 --> 0:29:40,272
He's gonna be naked, trying
to put his penis inside of you.


506
0:29:40,272 --> 0:29:42,872
Yeah, inside.
Do you wanna look your best?


507
0:29:42,872 --> 0:29:44,792
Yeah!


508
0:29:44,792 --> 0:29:47,912
Oh, God.


509
0:29:47,912 --> 0:29:53,952
I never wanna have an orgasm
if it looks like that.


510
0:29:53,952 --> 0:29:56,72
Are you sure this is
even necessary?


511
0:29:56,72 --> 0:29:59,312
I mean, he kissed me...


512
0:29:59,312 --> 0:30:1,72
so he must like me.


513
0:30:1,72 --> 0:30:3,672
Yeah, but he's got to be
turned on by you, Rae.


514
0:30:3,672 --> 0:30:6,32
You know? Otherwise...


515
0:30:6,32 --> 0:30:8,672
Well...
Otherwise well what?


516
0:30:8,672 --> 0:30:13,272
Well, listen, sometimes men,
they can have problems,


517
0:30:13,272 --> 0:30:14,792
you know, being ready.


518
0:30:14,792 --> 0:30:17,512
Well, how often does that
happen? Well...


519
0:30:17,512 --> 0:30:19,272
if they don't like something


520
0:30:19,272 --> 0:30:21,592
or if they feel uncomfortable.


521
0:30:21,592 --> 0:30:25,872
So, please, will you hurry up
and try on the outfit,
cos I'm bored.


522
0:30:25,872 --> 0:30:27,712
All right. Chlo...


523
0:30:27,712 --> 0:30:31,712
I think we should go
with the black leggings.


524
0:30:31,712 --> 0:30:33,312
Yeah, maybe you're right,
actually.


525
0:30:33,312 --> 0:30:34,712
Rae, try these leggings on.


526
0:30:34,712 --> 0:30:38,32
Oh, right.


527
0:30:38,32 --> 0:30:41,112
What happened to your legs,
Rae?


528
0:30:41,112 --> 0:30:44,552
I was in an accident
when I was in France.


529
0:30:44,552 --> 0:30:46,832
Oh, my God!


530
0:30:46,832 --> 0:30:50,192
Do they look horrible?


531
0:30:50,192 --> 0:30:52,752
You can't even really notice them.


532
0:30:52,752 --> 0:30:59,432
D'you think Archie
will be turned off by them?


533
0:30:59,432 --> 0:31:1,592
Maybe we could put
some makeup on 'em.


534
0:31:1,592 --> 0:31:3,152
Would that work?


535
0:31:3,152 --> 0:31:4,712
We could try.


536
0:31:4,712 --> 0:31:6,952
But if we're gonna put
makeup on your legs, Rae,


537
0:31:6,952 --> 0:31:10,72
it seems mad not to let me do
all your makeup properly.


538
0:31:10,72 --> 0:31:14,152
All right!
Yeah!


539
0:31:14,152 --> 0:31:16,672
Rae...


540
0:31:16,672 --> 0:31:19,792
um, why didn't you tell me?


541
0:31:19,792 --> 0:31:34,32
Eh? Come here!


542
0:31:34,32 --> 0:31:38,792
If you want to make someone
touch you and you can't change
the way you look,


543
0:31:38,792 --> 0:31:41,992
I guess the next best thing is
to hide it, with makeup,


544
0:31:41,992 --> 0:31:45,32
with clothes, with whatever
you can find.


545
0:31:45,32 --> 0:31:47,592
I feel sick.


546
0:31:47,592 --> 0:31:50,912
Maybe I should just cancel.
No. Look at me.


547
0:31:50,912 --> 0:31:55,112
We haven't spend three hours
making you look super foxy
for you to walk away.


548
0:31:55,112 --> 0:31:57,872
Me and Chlo will come in
for the first 20 minutes.


549
0:31:57,872 --> 0:32:0,112
Make sure everything's OK.


550
0:32:0,112 --> 0:32:8,592
Well, you go first, foxy lady.
Oh, shut up!


551
0:32:8,592 --> 0:32:10,472
Hi.


552
0:32:10,472 --> 0:32:13,72
Who are you? Who's that?


553
0:32:13,72 --> 0:32:18,192
Um... This is my Uncle Kester.
These are my friends.


554
0:32:18,192 --> 0:32:20,152
Chloe. Hi.


555
0:32:20,152 --> 0:32:21,632
Izzy. Hiya.


556
0:32:21,632 --> 0:32:22,832
Hello.


557
0:32:22,832 --> 0:32:25,912
Are you the uncle
Rae stopped with in France?


558
0:32:25,912 --> 0:32:29,392
Yeah. That... That...
That's right.Bonjour!


559
0:32:29,392 --> 0:32:38,112
Er, peut-etre que je peux pratiquer
mon francais avec vous?


560
0:32:38,112 --> 0:32:42,712
Er, I'm... I don't speak
French when I'm in England.


561
0:32:42,712 --> 0:32:45,392
In case I forget how
to speak English.


562
0:32:45,392 --> 0:32:46,632
Oh, right.


563
0:32:46,632 --> 0:32:48,912
Oh, my God, Rae was just telling me


564
0:32:48,912 --> 0:32:50,312
about her accident.
Chloe...


565
0:32:50,312 --> 0:32:54,232
We've gotta go.


566
0:32:54,232 --> 0:32:57,72
It was lovely to meet you
anyway. Bye.


567
0:32:57,72 --> 0:33:11,792
Ciao.


568
0:33:11,792 --> 0:33:13,112
Can I have a coffee, please?


569
0:33:13,112 --> 0:33:53,272
Thanks.


570
0:33:53,272 --> 0:33:54,312
Yo.


571
0:33:54,312 --> 0:33:55,672
What are you doing here?


572
0:33:55,672 --> 0:33:57,72
I've just seen Archie.


573
0:33:57,72 --> 0:33:58,352
He ain't coming.


574
0:33:58,352 --> 0:34:3,512
He said to say... Well,
he said to say that, really.


575
0:34:3,512 --> 0:34:6,312
Right.


576
0:34:6,312 --> 0:34:10,832
Why are you dressed like Chloe?
I'm not dressed like Chloe.


577
0:34:10,832 --> 0:34:11,912
OK.


578
0:34:11,912 --> 0:34:22,792
See you later, then.


579
0:34:22,792 --> 0:34:24,352
Rae, what did Finn say?


580
0:34:24,352 --> 0:36:0,85
Don't. Just leave me alone.


581
0:36:0,85 --> 0:36:5,81
' "When Alexander the Great saw
the breadth of his domain, he wept,


582
0:36:5,81 --> 0:36:9,81
' "for there were no more worlds
to conquer."


583
0:36:9,81 --> 0:36:13,5
'That's Archie's favourite quote.


584
0:36:13,5 --> 0:36:17,34
'My domain is my bed.
'I'm weeping for the opposite reason.


585
0:36:17,34 --> 0:36:20,98
'The world has conquered me.'


586
0:36:20,98 --> 0:36:22,94
It's midday.


587
0:36:22,94 --> 0:36:27,18
I know.


588
0:36:27,18 --> 0:36:31,38
I'm just about to make
a sausage casserole.


589
0:36:31,38 --> 0:36:33,82
Not hungry.


590
0:36:33,82 --> 0:36:43,58
I've got tiger bread
and spread for dipping.


591
0:36:43,58 --> 0:36:45,74
What spread is it?


592
0:36:45,74 --> 0:36:46,98
Lurpak.


593
0:36:46,98 --> 0:36:50,22
Normal or unsalted?


594
0:36:50,22 --> 0:36:51,86
Normal.


595
0:36:51,86 --> 0:37:3,62
Obviously.


596
0:37:3,62 --> 0:37:6,34
I thought about it.


597
0:37:6,34 --> 0:37:7,7
I shouldn't have gone out.


598
0:37:7,7 --> 0:37:12,1
I deserve to be grounded.


599
0:37:12,1 --> 0:37:14,38
Right.


600
0:37:14,38 --> 0:37:16,46
Right, well, um...


601
0:37:16,46 --> 0:37:20,78
since you've thought about it
and you're sorry...


602
0:37:20,78 --> 0:37:22,576
I don't think you do
need to be grounded.


603
0:37:22,576 --> 0:37:23,856
You can go out, if you want.


604
0:37:23,856 --> 0:37:28,856
Just behave yourself,
be responsible.


605
0:37:28,856 --> 0:37:37,936
Karim.


606
0:37:37,936 --> 0:37:40,496
Rae, it's for you.


607
0:37:40,496 --> 0:37:48,296
It's a young man.


608
0:37:48,296 --> 0:37:49,936
What?


609
0:37:49,936 --> 0:37:51,576
I came about yesterday.


610
0:37:51,576 --> 0:37:53,816
Come to take the piss, have you?
No.


611
0:37:53,816 --> 0:37:55,416
Just save it.
I would never have done it


612
0:37:55,416 --> 0:37:57,896
if I knew
you were supposed to be on a date.


613
0:37:57,896 --> 0:38:0,696
Oh. How very grown-up of you!


614
0:38:0,696 --> 0:38:2,856
Look, I know you don't like me,
and that's fine, right?


615
0:38:2,856 --> 0:38:4,696
But I just...


616
0:38:4,696 --> 0:38:8,536
I think he's a dick for what he did.


617
0:38:8,536 --> 0:38:19,376
I didn't want you adding it
to the very long list
of things you hate about me.


618
0:38:19,376 --> 0:38:23,336
Finn.


619
0:38:23,336 --> 0:38:28,776
The list isn't that long.


620
0:38:28,776 --> 0:38:32,136
Archie's at work
at the leisure centre right now.


621
0:38:32,136 --> 0:38:34,376
If I were you, I'd find him


622
0:38:34,376 --> 0:38:50,456
and I'd stick a fucking boot
right up his arse.


623
0:38:50,456 --> 0:38:52,896
Weight Watchers is Tuesday.
Yeah?


624
0:38:52,896 --> 0:38:54,896
Why don't you just tell me where
Archie is


625
0:38:54,896 --> 0:38:57,496
before I wrap my fist
right round your nose?


626
0:38:57,496 --> 0:38:58,576
He's in the wet rooms.


627
0:38:58,576 --> 0:39:0,308
But it's 50p admission, though.


628
0:39:0,308 --> 0:39:40,268
Fuck off!


629
0:39:40,268 --> 0:39:42,428
Rae! Shit!


630
0:39:42,428 --> 0:39:44,548
Are you peeping?
No. No, no.


631
0:39:44,548 --> 0:39:47,108
No. No. It's not what it looks like.


632
0:39:47,108 --> 0:39:49,828
Because it looks like you're a
pervert. No. Er... It...


633
0:39:49,828 --> 0:39:51,468
Let me explain. It... It's just...


634
0:39:51,468 --> 0:39:52,908
It... I swear.


635
0:39:52,908 --> 0:39:53,948
Move. Please.


636
0:39:53,948 --> 0:39:55,108
Archie, move.
Rae, no. No!


637
0:39:55,108 --> 0:39:57,748
Move! Rae!


638
0:39:57,748 --> 0:40:0,108
Rae.


639
0:40:0,108 --> 0:40:8,348
Rae. Just...


640
0:40:8,348 --> 0:40:10,428
Rae, please...


641
0:40:10,428 --> 0:40:12,748
Rae, please. Please stop.
Stop. Look at me.


642
0:40:12,748 --> 0:40:14,668
Just... Just stop a second.
I knew it!


643
0:40:14,668 --> 0:40:16,628
I knew you couldn't
possibly like me.


644
0:40:16,628 --> 0:40:17,668
Shh!


645
0:40:17,668 --> 0:40:19,308
How could you do this to me?


646
0:40:19,308 --> 0:40:22,268
Why not just leave me alone
in the first place?


647
0:40:22,268 --> 0:40:23,908
Rae, please.
I know that I'm ugly and I know


648
0:40:23,908 --> 0:40:28,508
that boys don't like me, so why...
why make me think that you did?


649
0:40:28,508 --> 0:40:30,508
I'm really sorry. OK?


650
0:40:30,508 --> 0:40:32,348
Just, please...


651
0:40:32,348 --> 0:40:33,828
Oh, my God!


652
0:40:33,828 --> 0:40:36,108
Did I do it?


653
0:40:36,108 --> 0:40:38,628
Did I make you gay?
No, no, no, no, of course not.


654
0:40:38,628 --> 0:40:40,68
Was it me? Shh!


655
0:40:40,68 --> 0:40:51,228
Just... Just calm down. Just wait.


656
0:40:51,228 --> 0:40:54,388
I bottled it.


657
0:40:54,388 --> 0:41:0,588
I thought if I tried to be straight
for a bit... then maybe...


658
0:41:0,588 --> 0:41:2,268
You don't know what it's like.


659
0:41:2,268 --> 0:41:7,188
Having this big bloody secret
that could come out at any moment.


660
0:41:7,188 --> 0:41:11,308
It's horrible.


661
0:41:11,308 --> 0:41:15,68
I'm really sorry.


662
0:41:15,68 --> 0:41:18,148
What did you think...


663
0:41:18,148 --> 0:41:19,868
when you saw my legs...


664
0:41:19,868 --> 0:41:21,948
at the pool party?


665
0:41:21,948 --> 0:41:24,28
Dunno. Er...


666
0:41:24,28 --> 0:41:28,388
- I thought you'd been in
an accident or something.
- Did you think I was a freak?


667
0:41:28,388 --> 0:41:40,268
Why would I ever think that?


668
0:41:40,268 --> 0:41:43,668
Why don't you just be brave
and tell people?


669
0:41:43,668 --> 0:41:46,748
Then you'd be free to be yourself.


670
0:41:46,748 --> 0:41:48,588
You wouldn't have to
worry all the time.


671
0:41:48,588 --> 0:41:52,508
Come out, in Lincolnshire,
when I'm still in high school?


672
0:41:52,508 --> 0:41:57,948
That's not bravery.
That's just asking for it.


673
0:41:57,948 --> 0:42:0,388
RH Tawney said...


674
0:42:0,388 --> 0:42:3,348
"What's freedom for the pike
is death for the minnow."


675
0:42:3,348 --> 0:42:5,708
I think I believe that.


676
0:42:5,708 --> 0:42:8,188
Archie...


677
0:42:8,188 --> 0:42:10,468
You know, for a gayer...


678
0:42:10,468 --> 0:42:16,348
you really are
a boring fucker sometimes!


679
0:42:16,348 --> 0:42:18,148
D'you know what?


680
0:42:18,148 --> 0:42:23,868
There is one thing you can do
to make it up to me.


681
0:42:23,868 --> 0:42:28,268
'Well, Chop said that
Archie literally, like,
begged you to forgive him'


682
0:42:28,268 --> 0:42:31,508
- and then he asked you to go out
with him, and you said no.
- 'Yeah,'


683
0:42:31,508 --> 0:42:34,668
he did beg and that, but whatever.


684
0:42:34,668 --> 0:42:39,188
I'm just... I'm at a stage in my life
where I am loving being single.


685
0:42:39,188 --> 0:42:41,428
That is so hardcore!


686
0:42:41,428 --> 0:42:51,708
'Why didn't I think of that?'


687
0:42:51,708 --> 0:42:57,268
It's fucking embarrassing
how good I look some days.


688
0:42:57,268 --> 0:42:58,548
So...


689
0:42:58,548 --> 0:43:1,788
how long does it take
for you to actually believe it?


690
0:43:1,788 --> 0:43:11,628
Oh, I think it's a lifelong project
for everyone.


691
0:43:11,628 --> 0:43:15,492
Rae!


692
0:43:15,492 --> 0:43:25,787
Danny, Tix would like
to say something to you.


693
0:43:25,787 --> 0:43:26,891
I'm...


694
0:43:26,891 --> 0:43:29,731
sorry for hitting you with the tray.


695
0:43:29,731 --> 0:43:33,171
Repeatedly hitting you
with the tray.


696
0:43:33,171 --> 0:43:34,451
That's all right.


697
0:43:34,451 --> 0:43:37,971
I should've remembered
not to surprise you like that.


698
0:43:37,971 --> 0:43:53,322
I forgot you don't like it.


699
0:43:53,322 --> 0:43:59,722
Please take your hand off mine.


700
0:43:59,722 --> 0:44:4,122
'Maybe some bodies
weren't meant to be touched.


701
0:44:4,122 --> 0:44:10,2

wasn't meant to be stroked...'


702
0:44:10,2 --> 0:44:17,202

Wow!
