###4 CROWD: This is Mrs. Lauther`s (ph) U.S. History class from Zaffer (ph), Kansas.
###8 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now, here is Carl to present us with CNN STUDENT NEWS.

###14 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Nice. We appreciate the intro and the pun from Mrs. Lauther`s
###18 (ph) class. I am Carl Azuz, presenting your commercial free news on this Monday, January
###23 7th.
###38 First up today, some help is on the way for victims of what came to be known as super
###42 storm Sandy. The critics say that help is not enough. On Friday, one day after getting
###47 to work, the 113th U.S. Congress passed a bill worth $9 billion. The money from the
###53 federal government will be put in an insurance program that will help cover costs for this,
###59 this incredible damage we keep seeing from the October storm that was 1,000 miles wide.
###65 The money won`t do much to help businesses, though. More than 200,000 had some kind of
###71 damage, or were otherwise impacted by Sandy. And that`s why some of them and many lawmakers
###76 are calling for more government aid. Congress is scheduled to take up another bill worth
###81 $51 billion in business relief, but not until January 15.
###87 Another issue Congress is looking at - guns. The goal is to find a way to prevent more
###92 tragic shootings in the U.S. But there are a lot of ideas about how to do that, so many
###97 that in the U.S. House of Representatives alone, almost 12 bills were introduced last
###103 week that had something to do with gun violence. So is the answer more restrictions on guns
###109 or the people who can buy them, or more guns in more places? Congress, surprise, surprise,
###114 will have to find some middle ground on this to get something through both Houses and signed
###119 by the president.
###120 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###121 ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: As students in Sandy Hook elementary returned to class,
###125 former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, nearly killed in a mass shooting two years ago, visited
###131 Newtown, Connecticut. And on Capitol Hill, lawmakers arrived to begin a new session of
###137 Congress, with members in both chambers taking aim at guns.
###141 SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, D-CALIFORNIA: This is a fight that the American people are going
###144 to have to stand up and stiffen their spine.
###147 JONES: California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein plans to introduce a bill to ban
###151 more 100 assault weapons, 8 years after the old ban she championed expired.
###157 Another Senate bill would ban high-capacity magazines, and among nearly a dozen gun bills
###162 introduced on day one in the House are efforts to ban online sales of ammunition, and to
###167 require background checks for all firearm sales, including at gun shows. Two bills from
###173 freshmen Republican congressmen would allow more guns around schools, echoing the position
###178 of the National Rifle Association.
###180 WAYNE LAPIERRE, CEO, NRA: The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with
###187 a gun.
###188 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are better than 32 more gun murders every day.
###192 JONES: Pro gun control groups plan to keep pressing for action, but what are the prospects
###197 for their success?
###198 JOHN GRAMLICH, CQ ROLL CALL: If you`re talking about stuff around the edges, like maybe banning
###202 high-capacity ammunition magazines, that might be possible. The NRA is the big issue, but
###207 I wouldn`t say it`s necessarily on the Republican side only, it`s on the Democratic side also.
###212 You have fully half of your new Senate has an either A+, A, or an A- rating from the
###217 NRA. So if you want anything to happen on gun control, you`re going to have to have
###220 at least half the Senate upsetting the NRA, and so that`s a very difficult proposition.
###225 FEINSTEIN: There is no more uphill fight than this. The question is do we fight or do we
###232 knuckle under?
###233 JONES: President Obama says he wants action on gun legislation this year. He`s asked Vice
###238 President Biden to lead a task force to come up with recommendations on gun policy. They
###243 are expected this month.
###245 Athena Jones, CNN, Washington.
###248 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###249 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can ID me. I`m a U.S. Government agency. I`m part of
###257 the Department of Health and Human Services. I`m responsible for protecting the health
###262 of people and animals, and I oversee everything from medicines to food to cosmetics.
###268 I`m the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
###276 AZUZ: Chances are you`ve gotten food poisoning at some point. The Centers for Disease Control
###283 and Prevention estimates that each year, one of every six Americans gets sick from something
###288 they eat. Part of the Food and Drug Administration`s job is to try to cut down on that as much
###293 as possible, so it proposed two new rules Friday that it says could prevent more than
###298 a million foodborne illnesses each year. One would be new safety standards for farmers
###304 and the fruits and vegetable they grow. For example, they`d have to make sure their water
###307 is clean and that animals are kept out of their fields.
###311 The other rule would require companies to have a plan in place to make sure their foods
###316 don`t make people sick, and for dealing with outbreaks if they do happen. There is a downside
###321 here, costs for farmers and businesses could go up, and that could mean higher food prices.
###327 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s Shoutout goes to Mr. Lund`s classes at Wallace Junior Senior
###334 High School in Wallace, Idaho.
###337 Which of these countries has the lowest literacy rate among women? If you think you know it,
###342 then shout it out. Is it Pakistan, Kenya, Jamaica or Saudi Arabia? You`ve got 3 seconds,
###352 go.
###353 In Pakistan, an estimated 40 percent of women know how to read and write, by far the lowest
###361 percentage of those countries. That`s your answer and that`s your shoutout.
###368 AZUZ: Malala Yousafzai is a 15-year-old who wants to change that. You heard us talk about
###373 her last year when she was attacked for promoting girls education rights in Pakistan. On Friday,
###380 Malala went home, a temporary home in the United Kingdom, where she`s been in the hospital.
###385 She has her family there with her, and doctors say she`s doing better, though after wounds
###389 to her head and neck, she has a long road ahead, and more surgery scheduled within the
###393 next month. Malala`s work and survival have already gotten international attention centered
###399 on women`s education rights in Pakistan. The country`s government says it will protect
###403 her if she decides to go back.
###406 Until a few years ago, you wouldn`t have found a woman serving aboard a U.S. Navy submarine.
###411 It just wasn`t allowed. The rule changed in 2009 and some of the first women who were
###416 chosen to do it said it wasn`t tougher because they were women; it was tougher because of
###421 the training. We`re going to dive a little deeper on what it`s like to serve the country
###425 underwater.
###425 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###426 CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It`s a new frontier for female sailors. Submerged
###434 for months, no sun, no space, no sleep.
###437 LT. JG MARQUETTE LEVEQUE, U.S. NAVY: (inaudible) dive.
###440 LAWRENCE: Lieutenant Junior Grade Marquette Leveque is one of the first women to qualify
###444 for submarine duty.
###445 (on camera): Was it everything you expected?
###447 LEVEQUE: I got a lot less sleep than I imagined I would.
###450 LAWRENCE (voice over): We met Leveque a few years ago when she went by her maiden name,
###454 Reid.
###455 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Marquette Jay Reid (ph)
###457 LAWRENCE: She was a cadet at the naval academy when the Pentagon opened sub duty to women.
###462 LEVEQUE: At the time, I was flying. I was a pilot. Selected to be a pilot after graduation.
###467 LAWRENCE: Leveque decided her future was under the water, not soaring above it. And she wasn`t
###473 afraid of breaking a barrier.
###474 LEVEQUE: I see us being just like our male counterparts, and I think that we`ll be accepted
###478 the same way.
###479 LAWRENCE: Leveque earned her dolphin.
###480 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations, great job.
###482 LAWRENCE: A gold chest device that means she`s mastered submarine operations.
###486 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sign the book.
###488 LEVEQUE: Yes, sir.
###488 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s been a long time coming, right?
###490 LEVEQUE: Yes.
###490 LAWRENCE: It took a year of nuclear training, three more months at submarine officer school.
###495 LEVEQUE: Dive (inaudible) two five zero feet.
###497 LAWRENCE: And then her first sea tour.
###500 LEVEQUE: It`s a huge honor to finally really feel like I`m a part of the submarine community.
###505 LAWRENCE: In fact, Leveque is one of only three women to qualify as unrestricted line
###511 officers. That`s big, because it means down the road she would be eligible to one day
###516 assume command of a nuclear powered sub. And it`s pretty clear that whenever war is waged
###523 under water, women are going to be a part of that fight.
###527 Chris Lawrence, CNN, the Pentagon.
###529 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###530 AZUZ: You folks in band might like this. Before we go, if your washing machine is rocking,
###534 it`s usually a sign that the clothes in it are unbalanced. This one just rocks.
###543 (MUSIC)
###547 AZUZ: What do you say about this? He`s 10 years old, has a great sense of rhythm, and
###555 totally rocked YouTube by making his washing machine his drum kit. No hum-drum performance
###561 there. I played drums in middle and high school. He would have totally taken me to the cleaners.
###565 It`s not that I washed out, it would just be hard to keep up rhythm. CNN STUDENT NEWS
###569 will tap back into the news cycle tomorrow. Hope to see you then.
