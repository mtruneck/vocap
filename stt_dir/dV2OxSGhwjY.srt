NINA MAK: When the media covers
pet cloning, it's often


5
0:0:15,79 --> 0:0:19,32
fluff pieces and these warm,
fuzzy pieces about, oh, look


6
0:0:19,32 --> 0:0:21,37
how cute these animals
are and isn't it cool


7
0:0:21,37 --> 0:0:22,95
that we could do this?


8
0:0:22,95 --> 0:0:27,21
And there's very little
coverage, if any, of what it


9
0:0:27,21 --> 0:0:30,24
really meant to clone that
animal and what it took.


10
0:0:30,24 --> 0:0:32,47
DR. DUANE KRAEMER: I think
it more of reproduction.


11
0:0:32,47 --> 0:0:35,57
If we had created her, we'd
have started from


12
0:0:35,57 --> 0:0:37,95
nothing and made her.


13
0:0:37,95 --> 0:0:42,505
But we started with ova from
other cats and cells from


14
0:0:42,505 --> 0:0:45,459
another cat and just put them
together in a way that they


15
0:0:45,459 --> 0:0:47,27
could reproduce.


16
0:0:47,27 --> 0:0:50,21
That's not vastly different
than people


17
0:0:50,21 --> 0:0:50,86

in some technology.

DR. DUANE KRAEMER: I'm
Duane Kraemer.


22
0:1:18,4 --> 0:1:21,3
I'm a professor at Texas
A&M University.


23
0:1:21,3 --> 0:1:25,13
I've been working in the area of
embryo transfer cloning and


24
0:1:25,13 --> 0:1:26,38
genetic engineering.


25
0:1:26,38 --> 0:1:32,25



26
0:1:32,25 --> 0:1:34,96
My dream was to become
a farmer.


27
0:1:34,96 --> 0:1:39,167
And I went to the university
intending to just get what I


28
0:1:39,167 --> 0:1:40,262
needed to come back.


29
0:1:40,262 --> 0:1:43,66
And then I got bit by
the research bug.


30
0:1:43,66 --> 0:1:46,97
My father was very disappointed
that I didn't


31
0:1:46,97 --> 0:1:48,79
come back to the farm.


32
0:1:48,79 --> 0:1:52,744
My mother said, well, I knew
you'd find something better.


33
0:1:52,744 --> 0:1:58,3
And I didn't mean that it was
better, it was just different.


34
0:1:58,3 --> 0:2:2,275
Cloning, as it's most
customarily practiced at the


35
0:2:2,275 --> 0:2:7,67
present, involves the transfer
of nuclei from cells and


36
0:2:7,67 --> 0:2:11,14
transferring those cells into
eggs where the nucleus has


37
0:2:11,14 --> 0:2:14,25
been removed, and then the
nucleus from the animal to be


38
0:2:14,25 --> 0:2:16,89
cloned is put in its place.


39
0:2:16,89 --> 0:2:20,93
If it's a mammal, those new
embryos then have to be


40
0:2:20,93 --> 0:2:24,14
transferred into recipient
females for them


41
0:2:24,14 --> 0:2:26,4
to carry on to term.


42
0:2:26,4 --> 0:2:30,4
And usually, those recipient
animals nurse them and raise


43
0:2:30,4 --> 0:2:31,29
them as well.


44
0:2:31,29 --> 0:2:35,6



45

This is the first of the
deer to be cloned.


46
0:2:38,29 --> 0:2:40,35
This is Dewey.


47
0:2:40,35 --> 0:2:42,88
Students named him after me.


48
0:2:42,88 --> 0:2:46,8
I think it's because I insisted
that he be allowed to


49
0:2:46,8 --> 0:2:48,116
be born natural birth.


50
0:2:48,116 --> 0:2:49,927
And he survived.


51
0:2:49,927 --> 0:2:55,5
I think that earned me that
privilege, I guess.


52
0:2:55,5 --> 0:2:58,99
NINA MAK: The truth is that
cloning is highly experimental


53
0:2:58,99 --> 0:3:0,95
and very problematic.


54
0:3:0,95 --> 0:3:3,28
And most of the time,
it doesn't work.


55
0:3:3,28 --> 0:3:5,5
Only a few clones have
actually been born


56
0:3:5,5 --> 0:3:6,32
successfully.


57
0:3:6,32 --> 0:3:9,4
And of the ones that have
been, a good percentage


58
0:3:9,4 --> 0:3:12,8
actually end up dying within the
first six months, because


59
0:3:12,8 --> 0:3:13,68
they have some sort of
complication, health


60
0:3:13,68 --> 0:3:15,8
abnormality, a physical
deformity,


61
0:3:15,8 --> 0:3:16,71
something like that.


62
0:3:16,71 --> 0:3:19,76
You talk about using a very
large number of animals to


63
0:3:19,76 --> 0:3:23,47
even try to produce
just one clone.


64
0:3:23,47 --> 0:3:24,94
DR. DUANE KRAEMER: Some people
just don't like anything


65
0:3:24,94 --> 0:3:30,53
that's unnatural and think
they can abide by that.


66
0:3:30,53 --> 0:3:33,99
But of course, most of the
things they do are unnatural.


67
0:3:33,99 --> 0:3:37,835
I think it has to do with the
Hollywood version, to some


68
0:3:37,835 --> 0:3:39,1
extent, of cloning.


69
0:3:39,1 --> 0:3:41,78
They have always pretty
much made it a


70
0:3:41,78 --> 0:3:44,9

71

Well, I hope that there will be
continued research to make


72
0:3:48,58 --> 0:3:51,36
it more dependable.


73
0:3:51,36 --> 0:3:56,11
At present, about 25% of
offspring have some type of


74
0:3:56,11 --> 0:3:57,52
abnormality.


75
0:3:57,52 --> 0:4:0,53
They're developmental
abnormalities.


76
0:4:0,53 --> 0:4:1,68
They're not mutations.


77
0:4:1,68 --> 0:4:4,95
They don't get passed on
to the next generation.


78
0:4:4,95 --> 0:4:6,17
But they need special care.

DR. DUANE KRAEMER: These
are microscopes we


81
0:4:15,847 --> 0:4:18,805
use to find the eggs.


82
0:4:18,805 --> 0:4:21,279
We have to get the eggs
out of ovaries.


83
0:4:21,279 --> 0:4:24,76
It is simple after you
learn how to do it.


84
0:4:24,76 --> 0:4:28,458
But there are just many,
many details


85
0:4:28,458 --> 0:4:29,796
that have to be followed.


86
0:4:29,796 --> 0:4:35,968
And if you do one thing wrong,
then the chain is broken and


87
0:4:35,968 --> 0:4:38,44
you get nothing from it.


88
0:4:38,44 --> 0:4:41,94
Well, our team is working on
a genetic engineering of


89
0:4:41,94 --> 0:4:48,73
livestock to produce animals
that are resistant to disease.


90
0:4:48,73 --> 0:4:52,2
This is the cloned bull that's
resistant to brucellosis,


91
0:4:52,2 --> 0:4:55,96
which is a disease that causes
abortion in cattle and


92
0:4:55,96 --> 0:4:58,39
undulant fever in humans.


93
0:4:58,39 --> 0:5:0,95
The original bull was naturally
resistant to it.


94
0:5:0,95 --> 0:5:5,43
His cells that were used for
cloning him have been stored


95
0:5:5,43 --> 0:5:7,275

96

brucellosis.

0:5:11,1 --> 0:5:14,55
The process of selective
breeding to produce superior


98
0:5:14,55 --> 0:5:17,97
individuals has been going on
for many years, even using


99
0:5:17,97 --> 0:5:18,71
natural breeding.


100
0:5:18,71 --> 0:5:22,43
And then embryo transfer and
artificial insemination made


101
0:5:22,43 --> 0:5:24,86
that process more efficient,
where you could get more


102
0:5:24,86 --> 0:5:27,38
offspring from the genetically
valuable animals.


103
0:5:27,38 --> 0:5:32,2
If they're superior and can't
reproduce by themselves, then


104
0:5:32,2 --> 0:5:38,594
the techniques such as cloning
can produce offspring.


105
0:5:38,594 --> 0:5:44,278
Anything we do could be used
incorrectly and wrongly.

somewhere, sometime.
