1
0:0:10,991 --> 0:0:15,251
I say it's over, unless there are
other questions that you have


2
0:0:15,251 --> 0:0:18,338
which you don't understand.


3
0:0:18,338 --> 0:0:22,602
This is the application of relativity,
that all things are relative.


4
0:0:22,602 --> 0:0:26,497
You can't know exactly
the way things work.


5
0:0:26,497 --> 0:0:29,809
You can only know
what you can receive.


6
0:0:29,809 --> 0:0:32,705
There's a gadget
that scientists use


7
0:0:32,705 --> 0:0:37,447
to see if there's an
electromagnetic field here.


8
0:0:37,447 --> 0:0:40,487
They also have a gadget
they lower from an airplane


9
0:0:40,487 --> 0:0:44,784
(like a big disk) with an electric
current going around in a circle.


10
0:0:44,784 --> 0:0:47,27
There's a lot of
iron under the land


11
0:0:47,27 --> 0:0:49,362
and it slows up the
electric current.


12
0:0:49,362 --> 0:0:53,844
Instead of going around
geologically looking for iron


13
0:0:53,844 --> 0:0:57,548
the airplane drops this down,
and it flies over the Earth


14
0:0:57,548 --> 0:1:0,11
and it tells you
where the iron is


15
0:1:0,11 --> 0:1:5,139
(do you understand?
) by a current moving around in a coil.


16
0:1:5,139 --> 0:1:8,489
It's called a magnetometer.


17
0:1:8,489 --> 0:1:11,1
That's how they know.


18
0:1:11,1 --> 0:1:13,873
In the old days they used to
dig down, find metals and say


19
0:1:13,873 --> 0:1:15,918
"This is a good place for it!"


20
0:1:15,918 --> 0:1:19,679
Nowadays, with a prism,
a certain type of prism


21
0:1:19,679 --> 0:1:23,267
arranged in a certain way,
if you aim it at a star.


22
0:1:23,267 --> 0:1:25,644
It tells us there's no
oxygen on that star


23
0:1:25,644 --> 0:1:28,569
no nitrogen, no water.


24
0:1:28,569 --> 0:1:33,55
The prism, the color bands, tell
you what there is on that planet.


25
0:1:33,55 --> 0:1:35,99
It was discovered accidentally


26
0:1:35,99 --> 0:1:40,813
when the Germans made airplanes
that were lighter and stronger.


27
0:1:40,813 --> 0:1:44,292
They didn't know what it was made of.
They heat the metal


28
0:1:44,292 --> 0:1:48,123
so it's bright white hot and
run it through a prism.


29
0:1:48,123 --> 0:1:50,98
They get a color band,
and the color band says:


30
0:1:50,98 --> 0:1:55,396
2% magnesium, 1% carbon, cobalt


31
0:1:55,396 --> 0:1:58,901
(you know what I mean?).
It's called spectral analysis.


32
0:1:58,901 --> 0:2:3,182
We can turn a spectrum
on anything today


33
0:2:3,182 --> 0:2:8,159
and if we heat it so it's white hot,
we can tell what it contains.


34
0:2:8,159 --> 0:2:10,671
That's how they knew
there's no air on the moon


35
0:2:10,671 --> 0:2:13,86
before they ever went there,
but normal people [ask]


36
0:2:13,86 --> 0:2:16,695
"How did they know there's no air on the moon?
They've never been there!"


37
0:2:16,695 --> 0:2:21,236
There are other ways, but they
don't know about spectroscopes.


38
0:2:21,236 --> 0:2:23,875
Do you know about
spectral analysis?


39
0:2:23,875 --> 0:2:26,323
A lot of people don't know about
those things, so they [say]:


40
0:2:26,323 --> 0:2:30,11
"How the hell do they know?
My opinion is just as good as theirs!"


41
0:2:30,11 --> 0:2:34,108
They don't look into it and
say "How do they know?"


42
0:2:34,108 --> 0:2:36,601
They speculate, you
know what I mean?


43
0:2:36,601 --> 0:2:40,139
That's why we have so
much trouble with people


44
0:2:40,139 --> 0:2:44,794
because they do not have a common
way of seeking information.


45
0:2:44,794 --> 0:2:51,22
They say "If you ask me, I think my
opinion's just as good as yours."


46
0:2:51,22 --> 0:2:53,616
Good.


47
0:2:53,616 --> 0:2:56,385
People want to
feel equal to you.


48
0:2:56,385 --> 0:3:0,243
They say "That's your opinion,
now I'm going to give you mine."


49
0:3:0,243 --> 0:3:3,681
They think one opinion
is as good as another


50
0:3:3,681 --> 0:3:8,603
and that's valid amongst people that
don't know how to check things out.


51
0:3:8,603 --> 0:3:12,508
They should say "I wonder how they
know there's no water on the moon"


52
0:3:12,508 --> 0:3:16,888
but wondering that, they don't
go to their computer and say


53
0:3:16,888 --> 0:3:19,131
"How do people know that?"


54
0:3:19,131 --> 0:3:21,72
I don't know if your
computer will handle that


55
0:3:21,72 --> 0:3:25,372
but your computer will
tell you every phase


56
0:3:25,372 --> 0:3:29,179
of metals with a memory.
If you put in


57
0:3:29,179 --> 0:3:33,624
'metals with a memory' or you put
in 'materials with a memory'


58
0:3:33,624 --> 0:3:36,273
you'll get more than
metals with a memory.


59
0:3:36,273 --> 0:3:40,74
If you put in 'What is memory?'


60
0:3:40,74 --> 0:3:44,44
(you know what I mean?
) That's another question altogether.


61
0:3:44,44 --> 0:3:46,564
We don't ask those questions


62
0:3:46,564 --> 0:3:50,63
because we're not brought
up to ask such questions.


63
0:3:50,63 --> 0:3:53,44
We're brought up [with]: If you
get money you can buy anything;


64
0:3:53,44 --> 0:3:57,139
a Rolls-Royce, or a big
house with 40 rooms.


65
0:3:57,139 --> 0:4:2,259
Most aims are for money, not
scientific instruments.


66
0:4:2,259 --> 0:4:5,393
If you wonder why do people
only think of making money?


67
0:4:5,393 --> 0:4:9,966
[It's] because they can buy any
car, any house, pay off people.


68
0:4:9,966 --> 0:4:13,597
Money is a symbol and it can
get you anything you want.


69
0:4:13,597 --> 0:4:17,441
If you study chemistry, you
might learn about chemicals


70
0:4:17,441 --> 0:4:21,249
but you can't afford to
live in a nice house.


71
0:4:21,249 --> 0:4:24,707
That's why people
are money-oriented.


72
0:4:24,707 --> 0:4:27,623
Not because they're
bad or greedy.


73
0:4:27,623 --> 0:4:29,991
[It's] because money gives
them what they want


74
0:4:29,991 --> 0:4:33,294
and without it they can't
have what they want.


75
0:4:33,294 --> 0:4:37,679
Is that real clear?
It's rewarding to people.


76
0:4:37,679 --> 0:4:41,357
If helping people is rewarding
you instead of money


77
0:4:41,357 --> 0:4:44,74
that's different, but
you'll be abused by it.


78
0:4:44,74 --> 0:4:47,583
You'll have to drive a
car that breaks down


79
0:4:47,583 --> 0:4:52,236
because you don't have the money to
buy a car that doesn't break down.


80
0:4:52,236 --> 0:4:56,711
A brand new Mercedes will last
longer than the average car


81
0:4:56,711 --> 0:4:58,98
but you can't afford that.


82
0:4:58,98 --> 0:5:3,473
If you use magnetic braking,
it will last longer


83
0:5:3,473 --> 0:5:5,384
but you can't afford it.


84
0:5:5,384 --> 0:5:8,26
People with money ask "What's
the best braking system?


85
0:5:8,26 --> 0:5:11,401
I'll take two.
" You know what I mean?


86
0:5:11,401 --> 0:5:16,602
"How do I make my house fireproof?
" "You do this. You do that"


87
0:5:16,602 --> 0:5:18,294
and they can afford it.


88
0:5:18,294 --> 0:5:21,54
Without money, you're
pissed off by people


89
0:5:21,54 --> 0:5:23,513
sleeping in the street.
You're broke.


90
0:5:23,513 --> 0:5:26,103
Everybody says "This
guy is a bum!"


91
0:5:26,103 --> 0:5:28,84
I've met, what they call 'bums'


92
0:5:28,84 --> 0:5:33,558
that were so well read, that they
didn't want any part of the system.


93
0:5:33,558 --> 0:5:37,791
They lived in poverty.
I think I told you about the guy in Haiti


94
0:5:37,791 --> 0:5:40,659
with a shirt made of
nothing but patches.


95
0:5:40,659 --> 0:5:42,968
I couldn't tell which
was the real shirt


96
0:5:42,968 --> 0:5:45,107
because it was so patched up.


97
0:5:45,107 --> 0:5:49,966
He was well informed
in semantics.


98
0:5:49,966 --> 0:5:53,684
The shirt he wore looked like a
guy put a hand grenade in it


99
0:5:53,684 --> 0:5:56,484
and blew it up.
There were holes all over it


100
0:5:56,484 --> 0:6:1,22
and torn, and he still buttoned
it up because that's all he had.


101
0:6:1,22 --> 0:6:7,48
He loved to read, and he
was very well informed


102
0:6:7,48 --> 0:6:9,36
in what he read


103
0:6:9,36 --> 0:6:13,23
but he was pissed
on by everybody.


104
0:6:13,23 --> 0:6:17,27
I talked to him for hours.
He was bright as hell


105
0:6:17,27 --> 0:6:23,508
but he couldn't identify with
being part of the world.


106
0:6:23,508 --> 0:6:26,722
So, they were considered bums


107
0:6:26,722 --> 0:6:30,81
and I consider politicians, bums


108
0:6:30,81 --> 0:6:34,658
and people that
design bombers, bums


109
0:6:34,658 --> 0:6:38,349
and the people that made
the atom bombs, dangerous


110
0:6:38,349 --> 0:6:42,497
because they gave it to people who
were not wise enough to use them.


111
0:6:42,497 --> 0:6:47,272
They couldn't take that into account,
but they loved the challenge


112
0:6:47,272 --> 0:6:50,881
of solving the problem.


113
0:6:50,881 --> 0:6:55,272
Even the Bible says "Cast
ye not pearl before swine."


114
0:6:55,272 --> 0:6:58,107
You know what that means?
If you give a pig a pearl


115
0:6:58,107 --> 0:7:0,817
it doesn't say "Gee
that's great, thank you!"


116
0:7:0,817 --> 0:7:4,374
If you give an atom bomb
to an undeveloped country


117
0:7:4,374 --> 0:7:7,633
they'll blast the hell out of
people they disagree with.


118
0:7:7,633 --> 0:7:10,7
They'll poison the Earth.
They don't care about that.


119
0:7:10,7 --> 0:7:12,234
They're not wise
enough to use it.


120
0:7:12,234 --> 0:7:16,194
That's what "Cast ye not pearl
before swine" means to me.


121
0:7:16,194 --> 0:7:19,696
Don't give people atom bombs.
Don't give people bombers


122
0:7:19,696 --> 0:7:22,927
unless they learn to
live together in peace!


123
0:7:22,927 --> 0:7:28,39
You give them airplanes,
spectroscopes and things like that


124
0:7:28,39 --> 0:7:33,55
so they can educate kids
in spectral analysis


125
0:7:33,55 --> 0:7:36,915
and magnetometers, and all the
things they don't know exist.


126
0:7:36,915 --> 0:7:39,809
They will not make
their own conclusions.


127
0:7:39,809 --> 0:7:45,58
They'll say "Let's put a spectrometer
on that and try to find out."


128
0:7:45,58 --> 0:7:47,413
They don't even think that way today.
They think


129
0:7:47,413 --> 0:7:51,4
"Man will always be greedy,
no matter what you do."


130
0:7:51,4 --> 0:7:54,628
You can say that man
has always been greedy


131
0:7:54,628 --> 0:7:57,872
due to scarcity or fear of loss.


132
0:7:57,872 --> 0:8:1,113
A man can have a million
dollars and still steal


133
0:8:1,113 --> 0:8:4,259
because he wants to
secure his position.


134
0:8:4,259 --> 0:8:7,15
He wants to make damn sure
that even if the banks fail


135
0:8:7,15 --> 0:8:9,786
he has money buried
under the mattress


136
0:8:9,786 --> 0:8:13,433
or under the ground in a
trunk in the backyard.


137
0:8:13,433 --> 0:8:17,819
People are insecure because
they've known banks to fail


138
0:8:17,819 --> 0:8:21,837
and all their money that they
put in the banks is gone


139
0:8:21,837 --> 0:8:25,135
because the bankers called
other bankers and said "Hey!


140
0:8:25,135 --> 0:8:28,251
We're going to sell out.
We're going to close down in three months.


141
0:8:28,251 --> 0:8:32,824
Take your money out" to their
friends in the banking business.


142
0:8:32,824 --> 0:8:36,325
They did that first, so
there was nothing left


143
0:8:36,325 --> 0:8:41,79
even though a guy worked all his
life and saved up $800,000.


144
0:8:41,79 --> 0:8:44,984
When the bank failed, they were
lined up outside the banks


145
0:8:44,984 --> 0:8:48,766
demanding their money.
The banks said "We don't have it"


146
0:8:48,766 --> 0:8:51,446
and the people killed
themselves because they felt


147
0:8:51,446 --> 0:8:53,64
they'd let their families down.


148
0:8:53,64 --> 0:8:56,496
So people that don't
put money in the banks


149
0:8:56,496 --> 0:9:1,3
they have a locker in banks
where you can put cash


150
0:9:1,3 --> 0:9:3,456
and it gets no interest


151
0:9:3,456 --> 0:9:8,394
but that can't be touched by the banks.
They can't invest it.


152
0:9:8,394 --> 0:9:11,483
In that way came a
form of security.


153
0:9:11,483 --> 0:9:15,89
If you put a million dollars
in the bank, if you did that


154
0:9:15,89 --> 0:9:20,424
and you get interest, you get
about $50,000 a year in interest


155
0:9:20,424 --> 0:9:22,896
so you don't have to
worry about anything.


156
0:9:22,896 --> 0:9:27,146
You can live on $50,000 a year as
long as your million stays there.


157
0:9:27,146 --> 0:9:31,385
And that puts it on the
back of other people.


158
0:9:31,385 --> 0:9:37,346
[Roxanne]
- We should... I should go down and... - Yes, OK.


159
0:9:37,346 --> 0:9:40,711
That was the last portion of a
talk on the subject of relativity


160
0:9:40,711 --> 0:9:43,689
and he covers some other
things in there, as well.


161
0:9:43,689 --> 0:9:46,222
If you'd like to
hear more of that


162
0:9:46,222 --> 0:9:49,185
as well as other
lectures in audio format


163
0:9:49,185 --> 0:9:51,906
please go to the twitter
page that we just set up


164
0:9:51,906 --> 0:9:55,872
where we will post links to more
new material including answers


165
0:9:55,872 --> 0:9:58,825
to questions and more
current update briefs.


166
0:9:58,825 --> 0:10:1,741
I'll put a link to
the twitter below.


167
0:10:1,741 --> 0:10:3,905
In addition to the
Venus Project tours


168
0:10:3,905 --> 0:10:6,159
which are given on
scheduled Saturdays


169
0:10:6,159 --> 0:10:9,654
Jacque continues to give
new lectures almost daily


170
0:10:9,654 --> 0:10:13,674
in which he covers all areas of
social designs, human behavior


171
0:10:13,674 --> 0:10:17,707
and more in depth issues that are
important to consider and understand


172
0:10:17,707 --> 0:10:20,521
when learning about this
direction and way of thinking.


173
0:10:20,521 --> 0:10:23,83
We're also doing our best to get


174
0:10:23,83 --> 0:10:27,703
these talks edited and released
onto DVD and expect to have


175
0:10:27,703 --> 0:10:31,558
about 15 to 20 new lectures
available as soon as we can.


176
0:10:31,558 --> 0:10:35,598
If you check on thevenusproject.
com, you go to the store


177
0:10:35,598 --> 0:10:38,419
check that out.
In the next hopefully few weeks


178
0:10:38,419 --> 0:10:40,893
there will be some new
material available there.


179
0:10:40,893 --> 0:10:44,52
Thanks for watching, and
also The Venus Project


180
0:10:44,52 --> 0:10:46,646
is appreciative of
everybody that's out there


181
0:10:46,646 --> 0:10:50,888
in the trenches talking about
