###0 >> >>PEGGY: TONIGHT ON KPBS EVENING EDITION, A HISTORIC VOTE ABOUT SAN DIEGO'S WATER SUPPLY
###5 AT STAKE THE COUNTY'S LONG TERM COMMITMENT TO BUY MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF DESALINATED
###10 WATER. AND WRECKING CREWS MOVE INTO HORTON PLAZA
###14 FOR THE START OF A 14ÊMILLION DOLLAR REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT.
###19 AN ALARMING NUMBER OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS ARE ABUSED ON THIS SIDE THE BORDER.
###23 WE'LL TAKE AN IN DEPTH LOOK AT REVEALING NEW RESEARCH.
###26 I'M PEGGY PICO. DWANE BROWN IS OFF TONIGHT.
###29 KPBS EVENING EDITION STARTS NOW. CAPTIONS PROVIDED BY ECAPTIONS LATE THIS AFTERNOON
###67 A HISTORIC VOTE CHANGED THE FUTURE OF SAN DIEGO'S WATER SUPPLY.
###71 THE COUNTY'S 24 WATER AGENCIES VOTED TO APPROVE A 30 YEAR CONTRACT TO BUY DESALINATED WATER
###78 FROM THE PRIVATE COMPANY PO SIDE N RESOURCE SES.
###81 KPBS REPORT ALISON ST. JOHN JUST RETURNED FROM THE MEETING.
###85 TELL US WHY THIS VOTE IS SO IMPORTANT. >> >>ALISON: SAN DIEGO CURRENTLY DEPENDS ON
###89 IMPORTED WATER AND MAKES IT VULNERABLE TO BEING CUT OFF IN A DPROWT SITUATION.
###95 THIS AGREEMENT WILL GIVE SAN DIEGO AN INDEPENDENT SOURCE OF WATER USING OCEAN WALTER THAT'S
###100 BEEN DESALINATED BY THE BIGGEST DESALINATION PLANT EVER BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT
###105 HERE IN CARLSBAD. THE PLAN WILL BE BUILT FOR ALMOST A BILLION
###110 DOLLARS AND THE CONTRACTOR AGREED TODAY COMMITS SAN DIEGO FOR ALMOST 50ÊMILLION GALLONS OF
###115 WATT AR DAY FOR 30 YEARS ONCE THE PLANT IS BUILD BUILT, WHICH COULD BE BY 2016, BECAUSE
###122 THE COMPANY ALREADY HAS ALL THE PERMITS. THAT WILL BE ABOUT 10% OF ALL THE WATER SAN
###127 DIEGO NEEDS. ONE BOARD MEMBER SAYS YOU CAN'T RECYCLE WATER
###131 IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT AND THIS WILL CREATE NEW WATER.
###135 >> >>PEGGY: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR RATE PAYERS? >> >>ALISON: THE COST IS STILL NOT KNOWN.
###141 THE COST OF SERVICE AGREEMENT IS NOT YET HASHED OUT AND SOME ESTIMATES ARE 5 TO 7 DOLLARS
###147 TO THE AVERAGE WATER BILL, AND OTHER PEOPLE SAY IT WILL ADD 10 TO 20 DOLLARS, OA EVEN
###151 MORE FOR BIG WATER USERS. OPPONENTS OF THE PROJECT POINTED OUT DESALINATION
###158 TAKE AS LOT OF ENERGY AND ENERGY COSTS COULD SKY ROCKET.
###162 THAT COULD THROW ALL THE CALCULATIONS OUT OF WACK.
###164 THEY SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SIGN ON TO WATER RECYCLING FIRST.
###169 THEY POINTED TO DESAL PLANTS IN AUSTRALIA THAT HAVE HAD TO BE SHUT DOWN BECAUSE THE
###173 COSTS SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL. SUPPORTS SAY THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN WRITTEN
###180 TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS. THE WATER AGENCIES AGREED TO START A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS TO
###187 DECIDE HOW TO SHARE THE COSTS. AS ONE MEMBER PUT IT, NOW THE REAL FIGHT BEGINS.
###194 >> >>PEGGY: TOMORROW THE U.S. SUPREME COURT WILL KUN SITEDDER IF IT WILL REVIEW A LEGAL
###201 CHALLENGE TO PROPOSITION 8, CALIFORNIA'S BAN ON SAME SEX MARRIAGE.
###205 SUPPORTER OF THE BAN ON SAME SEX MARRIAGE ARE APPEALING A LOWER COURT RULING.
###212 IF THE HIGH COURT AGREES TO TAKE ON THE CASE, ORAL ARGUMENTS COULD BE HEARD AS EARLY AS
###217 NEXT SPRING. IF THE JUSTICES REJECT THE APPEAL, THE LAST
###223 RULING WILL STAND, MEANING CALIFORNIA'S BAN ON SAME SEX MARRIAGE WILL NOT BE LEGAL.
###228 THE COURT'S DECISION ON WHETHER TO HEAR THE CASE IS EXPECTED ON MONDAY.
###233 A SECOND MAN HAS BEEN RESENTENCED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S NEWLY REFORMED THREE STRIKES LAW, BOTH CASES
###239 WERE HEARD HEAR HERE IN SAN DIEGO. THERE'S A TWIST IN THIS NEWEST REFORM CASE.
###243 KPBS FRONTERAS REPORTER ERIN SIEGEL IS IN THE NEWS ROOM WITH MORE.
###248 LAST WEEK KEN KENNETH CORELY WAS RESENTENCED AND RELEASED FOR CREDIT FOR TIME SERVED.
###253 >> >>: IT'S NOT QUITE SO SIMPLE. WHEN SERGIO WAS CONVICTED BACK IN 1995, HE WASN'T A U.S.
###263 CITIZEN. HE ONLY HAD LEGAL RESIDENCY.
###266 SO THIS MEANS NOW HE'S GOING TO BE DEPORTED AFTER HE'S RELEASED FROM PRISON.
###270 >> >>PEGGY: IS THERE A PLAN TO HELP HIM STAY IN TIJUANA AND OUT OF TROUBLE ONCE HE'S DEPORTED?
###274 >> >>ERIN: CERTAINLY, THERE IS. HIS LAWYERS TOLD ME THIS MORNING THERE IS
###278 AN EXTENSIVE PLAN IN PLACE FOR HIM. ONCE HE GETS TO TIJUANA, HE HAS A JOB IN PLACE,
###284 WORKING AS A MECHANIC, HE'S ALSO HAS A BED RESERVED FOR HIM FOR SIX MONTHS AT A REHAB
###289 FACILITY WHERE HE COULD BE OFFERED BENEFITS LIKE GROUP THERAPY AND OTHER THINGS.
###296 >> >>PEGGY: SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY CONDUCTED THE FIRST SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF LABOR TRAFFICKING
###303 IN THE U.S. THE REPORT INCLUDES INTERVIEWS WITH LOCAL
###306 MIGRANT WORKERS. THEIR STORIES REVEAL AN ALARMING AMOUNT OF
###309 DANGER, INJUSTICE AND ABUSE. I SPOKE WITH ONE OF THE STUDY'S RESEARCHERS
###314 ESTELA DE LOS RIOS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR SOCIAL ADVOCACY.
###323 WHO DID THE RESEARCHERS TALK WITH AND HOW DID YOU GET THAT INFORMATION?
###326 >> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: DUE TO OUR RELATIONSHIP IN THE COMMUNITY, WE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH
###333 MIKE RNT WORKERS IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE SAN DIEGO REGION.
###338 NORTH COUNTY, SOUTH COUNTY, EAST COUNTY, IN RURAL AND REMOTE AREAS.
###342 THEREFORE DR.ÊJANE CONNECTED WITH US TO OUTREACH TO THESE COMMUNITIES AND GET A RANDOM SAMPLING
###350 OF ALL THE REGIONS. >> >>PEGGY: YOU TALKED TO ABOUT 826 UNAUTHORIZED
###355 WORKERS, SPANISH SPEAKING. YOU ALSO OFFERED THEM SOME COMPENSATION FOR
###361 THIS. TELL US WHY.
###362 >> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: YES, WE HAD SOME INCENTIVES FOR THIS BECAUSE QUITE HONESTLY,
###366 THEY ARE LOSING A DAY'S WORK IN A WHOLE DAY. SO WE HAD A FOCUS GROUP AND ASKED THEM WHAT
###372 WOULD BE FAIR AND APPROPRIATE. THEY CAME UP WITH 30 DOLLARS A DAY, AND THEN
###377 HAVE THE REFERENCE IF THEY REFERRED SOMEONE IT WOULD BE 10 DOLLARS EXTRA.
###380 THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE 60 DOLLARS FOR THAT DAY.
###383 >> >>PEGGY: WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO THE QUESTIONS.
###385 FIRST, THE STUDY IDENTIFIED WHERE THESE WORKERS WERE EMPLOYED AND 20% WORKED IN FOOD PROCESSING,
###394 ANOTHER 17% IN CONSTRUCTION, 17% IN JANITORIAL SERVICES, 10% IN AGRICULTURE, AND 6% IN MANUFACTURING.
###402 I THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED THAT THESE SORT OF ABUSES OR THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO
###408 THESE IMMIGRANT WORKS DIDN'T HAPPEN OUT IN THE FIELDS.
###411 TWENTY% WERE IN FOOD PROCESSING. DID THAT SURPRISE YOU?
###414 >> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: ABSOLUTELY, THAT'S CORRECT.
###416 THESE PERCENTAGES REFLECT THE STUDY. THIS IS WHY IT'S THE HIDDEN POPULATION BECAUSE
###422 YOU WOULD NOT SUSPECT IN RESTAURANTS OR FOOD PROCESSING, THERE WOULD BE LABOR TRAFFICKING.
###427 >> >>PEGGY: KIND OF IN PLANE SIGHT. THE STUDY REVEALED NEARLY A THIRD IMMIGRANT
###432 WORKERS, 38,000, I BELIEVE, EXPERIENCE LABOR TRAFFICKING.
###438 TELL US WHAT LABOR TRAFFICKING IS. >> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: THAT'S A VERY GOOD
###441 QUESTION BECAUSE MANY TIMES THE CHALLENGE IS THESE ARE JUST LABOR ABUSES OR PRACTICES
###446 THEY'RE NOT LABOR TRAFFICKING. THERE'S A FINE LINE.
###448 WHEN IT BECOMES CORGZ COERCION, THREATS, FEAR TO LEAVE YOUR WORK OR THREATEN YOUR FAMILY'S
###455 LIFE OR HAVE SOME SEXUAL ABUSE, THEN IT BECOMES TRAFFICKING.
###459 >> >>PEGGY: THERE WERE REPORTS OF SEXUAL TRAFFICKING AS WELL, RAPES, ASSAULT, THINGS LIKE THAT.
###465 >> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: YES, THERE WAS A LOT OF CRIMES REPORTED FOR AN INSTANCE ONE
###469 THAT RESONATES IN MY MIND CONTINUOUSLY IS A MOTHER THAT SAW HER DAWRT BEING RAWPED,
###475 SHE WAS 12 YEARS OLD, AND THE 12 YEAR OLD OBSERVED THE MOTHER BEING RAPED.
###480 WE'RE SPEAKING RAPES, KIDNAPPING, THIS IS LABOR TRAFFICKING.
###486 >> >>PEGGY: LABOR OR SEXUAL TRAFFICKING. >> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: EXACTLY.
###489 >> >>PEGGY: DO THESE IMMIGRANT WORKS REPORT THIS TO AUTHORITIES?
###491 >> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: THAT'S THE CHALLENGE. WE HAVE TRIED TO WORK WITH AUTHORITY AUTHORITIES.
###495 AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN VERY POSITIVE IN OUR COLLABORATION. THE CHALLENGE IS THIS: THEY
###503 FEAR DEPORTATION, THEY FEAR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE INCARCERATED.
###508 WE CONTINUOUSLY LELT THEM KNOW THEY HAVE ROILGTS, THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR VISA, OPPORTUNITIES
###515 TO SPEAK UP. BUT THE FEAR FACTOR REMAINS.
###518 >> >>PEGGY: BEING DEPORTED OR WORSE. >> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: EXACTLY.
###522 >> >>PEGGY: WHAT WERE SOME OF THE OTHER LABOR AND SAFETY ISSUES MAYBE NOT AS LARGE AS THAT
###527 BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT. >> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: IN CONSTRUCTION,
###530 THEY WOULDN'T GIVE THEM THE HARD HATS, A LOT OF THEM WORKED WITH CHEMICALS AND WOULD GET
###536 BURNED. THEY WOULD HAVE A LOT OF HEALTH ISSUES AFTERWARDS
###540 WITH BREATHEING, PESTICIDES, AND ONE WOULD SAY JUST REPORT THEM TO OCEA, BUTS IT'S HUGE.
###549 BECAUSE YOU GO BACK AND THE EMPLOYER DISAPPEARS. >> >>PEGGY: AND ALSO I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS
###554 SO NO PAYMENT, IMPROPER EQUIPMENT AS YOU SAID. >> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: EXACTLY.
###557 >> >>PEGGY: SOME PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE THAT MIGRANT WORKS PUT THEMSELVES IN THIS VULNERABLE SITUATION,
###564 THEY'RE HERE ILLEGALLY, SO WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT CRITICISM?
###568 >> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: IN REGARDS TO THE STATUS WHETHER THEY'RE HERE UNDOCUMENTED OR
###573 DOCUMENTED, THESE ARE CRIMES. THESE ARE SERIOUS CRIMES WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT.
###577 I BELIEVE THAT CRIME SHOULD BE PROSECUTED. >> >>PEGGY: WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN YOU HEARD
###583 ABOUT SOME OF THESE HORRIFIC CRIMES LIKE THE MOTHER/DAUGHTER RAPE.
###586 HOW DID YOU GUYS HELP THE PEOPLE ONCE YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT THESE?
###590 >> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: WE FOLLOWED UP AND OUR ATTEMPT WAS TO TRY TO ASSIST THIS WOMAN
###595 TO REPORT THIS FIRST AND FOREMOST. BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE, SHE JUST
###601 WANTED TO LET IT GOAVMENT THESE ARE THE EXPERIENCES WE HAVE ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS.
###607 >> >>PEGGY: BUT YOU DID REACH OUT TO MANY OF THESE WORKERS.
###609 >> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: YES, WE ALWAYS REACH OUT TO THEM AND GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITIES
###613 TO ASSIST THEM WITH RESOURCES. >> >>PEGGY: OKAY.
###617 ESTELA DE LOS RIOS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING WITH US.
###621 YOU CAN READ THE ENTIRE SDSU REPORT CALLED LOOKING FOR A HIDDEN POPULATION, TRAFFICKING
###627 OF MIGRANT LABORERS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY ON OUR WEBSITE, KPBS.ORG.
###631 >> >>ESTELA DE LOS RIOS: THANK YOU. >> >>PEGGY: RESEARCHERS AT SAN DIEGO STATE
###635 HAVE ALSO LAUNCHED A NEW STUDY ON AUTISM. SCIENTISTS WILL LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE OF
###640 BRAIN NETWORKS AND TEENS WITH AUTISM COMPARED TO THOSE WHO AREN'T.
###645 RESEARCHERS HOPE THEIR WORK WILL HELP WITH EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT.
###650 MEAN WHILE, ANOTHER TEAM IN SAN DIEGO PLANNED ANOTHER TEAM OF RESEARCHERS PLANED TO SEND
###656 FRUIT FLIES INTO SPACE. THAT'S RIGHT, THE FLIES WILL HELP SCIENTISTS
###661 STUDY THE IMPACT OF SPACE TRAVEL ON THE HUMAN HEART.
###664 THE TEAM FROM SANFORD BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE SAYS FRUIT FLIES ARE PERFECT FOR
###669 THE STUDY BECAUSE THE GENETIC AND MOLECULAR MAKE UP OF THE CRITTER'S HEARTS ARE QUITE
###674 SIMILAR TO OUR OWN HUMAN HEARTS. ON THE NEXT NEWS HOUR.
###693 MELTING POW POLAR ICE SHEETS IN GREENLAND. THURSDAY ON THE PBS NEWS HOUR.
###703 >> >>PEGGY: IF YOU USUALLY GO TOOLT DOWNTOWN COUNTY BUILDING TO PAY YOUR PROPERTY TAXES
###708 YOU MAY WANT TO CHANGE YOUR ROUTINE THIS DECEMBER, MAJOR CONSTRUCTION IS UNDER WAY IN THE AREA,
###713 AND THE COUNTY TAX COLLECTOR IS URGING PEOPLE TO PAY SOME OTHER WAY; ONLINE, BY PHONE, AT
###719 BRANCH OFFICE OR BY MAIL. NO MATTER HOW YOU DO IT, PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS
###723 ARE DEW ON DECEMBERÊ10. DEMOLITION IS UNDERWAY AT HORTON PLAZA, THE
###732 OLD ROBINSON'S MAY BUILDING IS BEING TORN DOWN TO MAKE ROOM FOR A NEW PUBLIC PARK.
###737 THE 14ÊMILLION DOLLAR PROJECT IS ONE OF THE FINAL PROJECTS CREATED BY SAN DIEGO'S NOW
###742 DEFUNCT AGENCY. DATING BACK TO FORMER MAYOR PETE WILSON.
###752 >> >>: WE THOUGHT THAT WITH A LITTLE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE WE COULD SPUR A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
###759 OF CONFIDENCE AND THEREFORE PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND PRIVATE RENEWAL, GAS LAMP DID NOT EXIST.
###768 BUT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY WHAT'S HAPPENED HAS EXCEEDED MY FONDEST EXPECTATIONS.
###772 >> >>PEGGY: WESTFIELD OWNS THE SHOPPING CENTER AND SOLD THE ROBINSON'S MAY STORE BACK TO
###778 THE CITY FOR THE NEW 1 ACRE PUBLIC SQUARE. WE CAUGHT UP WITH KEVIN FAULCONER FOR THE
###787 ARE R Y DEVELOPMENT. >> >>PEGGY: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
###794 US. EXPANSION OF THE OLD HORTON PLAZA PARK IS
###797 ACTUALLY A CITY PROJECT AND SUPPOSED TO ADD PUBLIC SPACE IN FRONT OF THE HORTON PLAZA
###802 SHOPPING CENTER. REMIND US OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE NOW AND
###806 HOW THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE. >> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: THANK YOU FOR HAVING
###808 ME, IT WAS A VERY EXCITING DAY DOWNTOWN. WE'RE EMBARKING ON A REMARKABLE TRANSFORMATION.
###813 WEER GROARING TO TEAR DOWN THAT OLD BUILDING RIGHT IN THE FRONT THAT USED TO BE THE PLANET
###817 HOLLYWOOD, AND WE'RE CREATING WORLD CLASS PUBLIC PARK OPEN SPAIRKS 1 DISPA HALF MAKERS.
###822 ONE AND A HALF ACRES THAT WILL BE A SPECIAL PLACE.
###826 >> >>PEGGY: LET'S TAKE A LOOK THAT ARCHITECT'S PLANS.
###829 THE FIRST ONE IS SORT OF AN OVERVIEW HERE. TELL US WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.
###833 >> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THERE, THE PHOTO OF THE NEW PARK YOU SEE TOWARDS
###837 THE RIGHT HAND PORTION OF THE PICTURE, THE CURRENT PARK.
###840 BUT WE AREÊ THAT BUILDING GOES AWAY, WE CREATE AS I SAID BEFORE AN ACRE AND A HALF OF PUBLIC
###845 OPEN SPACE TO SEE THE NEW TREES, THE AMPHITHEATER THERE, THE SEATING, RESTROOMS, FOOD PAVILIONS.
###852 >> >>PEGGY: LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT AMPHITHEATER. WHAT'S THAT GOING TO BE USED FOR.
###856 >> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: THE WHOALD IDEA OF THE SPACE IS TO ACTIVATE IT, MAKE SURE WE'RE ATTRACTING
###861 PEOPLE DURING THE DAY AND DURING THE NIGHT. SO WE HAVE ABOUT 200 DAY AS YEAR WE'RE PLANNING
###865 ON PROGRAMS FOR ANYTHING FROM DANCES TO CONCERTS TO MOVIES ON THE BACK OF THE WALL THERE.
###871 THE IDEA IS LET'S BRING PEOPLE THERE, ACTIVATE IT.
###874 >> >>PEGGY: I WANT TO GET A SHOT OF THAT MOVIE, THE RENDITION ARTIST'S RENDITION.
###877 CAN WE SHOW EVERYBODY? LOOK AT THAT GIANT SCREEN.
###880 >> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: A GREAT SHOT A NIGHT SHOT, IF YOU WILL, WITH EVERYBODY SITTING
###883 AROUND THE AMPHITHEATER. THE BUILDING THERE NOW, THAT'S DESIGNED TO
###888 BE A DIGITAL BACKGROUND FOR MOVIES AND SPECIAL PRESENTATIONS AND OTHERS.
###893 I THINK AS YOU LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITIES THERE, YOU KNOW, SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE OUT THERE
###897 ON A WARM SAN DIEGO NIGHT, THAT'S THE TYPE OF GATHERING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
###902 WORLD CLASS, OPEN PUBLIC SPACE, AND THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY.
###906 >> >>PEGGY: LET'S TALK ABOUT DURING THE DAY. WE SAW THE MOVIES THERE AT NIGHT, BUT THERE
###909 WAS AN ARTIST RENDITION WE'LL PUT UP HERE FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE, WHERE THERE'S ACTUALLY
###913 TENTS IN THE CENTER OF THIS. WHAT ARE THOSE FOR?
###917 >> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: THIS IS A GOOD ILLUSTRATION THAT SHOWS WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE ON A SATURDAY
###920 OR SUNDAY AS WE HAVE VENDORS FOR A FARMER'S MARKET OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS TO ATTRACT
###926 PEOPLE, TEMPORARY TENTS, DO SOME SHOPPING, BE OUT DOORS, OUT IN THE SUN SHINE, AND SO
###933 THIS RENDERING RIGHT HERE IS I THINK WHAT YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE A LOT DURING THE DAY ON
###936 A SATURDAY OR SUNDAY. >> >>PEGGY: THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT THIS
###939 OPEN SPACE YOU TOUCHED ON. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS LAST ARTISTS PICTURE
###943 HERE. YOU CAN SEE YOU WERE TELL ME YOU CAN SEE THROUGH
###946 NOW THE AREA ALL THE WAY BACK TO TELL US WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT SO WE CAN SEE.
###951 >> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE RENDERINGS.
###953 YOU LOOK ON BROADWAY LOOKING BACK, THE BUILDING IS GONE, AND WE CREATE AD REMARKABLE VISTA
###960 VIEW TO THE HITS HISTORIC BALBOA THEATER YOU'RE SEEING IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE SHOT.
###964 LOOKING THROUGH THE COLUMNS, YOU SAW THEM LIT UP AT NIGHT.
###968 THIS IS GOING TO BE A WHOLE NEW FRONT PORCH FOR DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO, AND AS YOU CAN SEE
###972 BY THE AMPHITHEATER SHOT THERE, AND ALL OF THE TREES, IT'S GOING TO BE A PLACE OF GATHERING
###977 PLACE FOR FAMILIES, FOR OTHER FOLKS, AND WE WERE OUT THERE TALKING TODAY AT THE GROUND
###982 PEOPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THIS WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE TO HAVE NEW DWREER'S EVE CELEBRATIONS.
###985 >> >>PEGGY: THE EXCITEMENT OF IT. THE CITY ACQUIRED THIS STORE PROPERTY, I THINK
###993 IT WAS ROBINSON MAY MAY THEN HOLLYWOOD PLANET. >> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: PLANET HOLLYWOOD.
###997 >> >>PEGGY: BUT THEY DID IT IN A CREATIVE WAY.
###1001 WHAT WAS THAT ARRANGEMENT? >> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: GRIET GREAT PRIVATE
###1004 PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP WITH THE WESTFIELD CORPORATION. THEY WERE LOOKING TO MAKE SOME CHANGES AND
###1009 THE CITY HAS BEEN LOOKING TO PROVIDE MORE OPEN SPARK SPACES AND PUBLIC PARK PARKS. THIS
###1014 CAME FROM FINANCING FROM WESTFIELD, REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY, NOW CIVIC SAN DIEGO, A GREAT PARTNERSHIP
###1021 WITH THE IDEA HOW CAN WE GET THIS DONE AND COMPLETED.
###1026 TOOK ABOUT TWO YEARS. AND SO TODAY WAS A PRETTY BIG MILESTONE.
###1030 >> >>PEGGY: WILL THIS GENERATE ANY FUNDS FOR THE CITY?
###1034 >> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: IT WON'T GENERATE MUCH FUNDS.
###1036 WE'LL IS HAVE SOME SALES TAX FROM SOME OF THE VENDORS, BUT THIS IS ABOUT PROVIDING AN
###1041 AMENITY, PROVIDING THE GATHERING SPACE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER CITIES WHETHER IT'S
###1046 ACROSS THE COUNTRY OR ACROSS THE WORLD, ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF A GREAT URBAN SPACE IS
###1050 TO HAVE GAISÊ GREAT URBAN CITY IS TO HAVE THESE GREAT PUBLIC OPEN GATHERING SPACES.
###1055 WE DON'T QUITE HAVE THAT IN DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO, BUT WE'RE GOING TO NOW.
###1058 >> >>PEGGY: WHAT WILL WESTFIELD GET OUT OF IT?
###1061 >> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: THEY WANTED TO MAKE HORTON PLAZA MORE INVITING, MORE ATTRACTIVE.
###1067 REMEMBER WHEN HORTON PLAZA WAS DEVELOPED, DOWNTOWN WAS A VASTLY DIFFERENT PLACE.
###1072 IT WASN'T THE SAFEST PLACE TO BE, THE SHOPPING CENTER WAS DESIGNED INWARD, NOT OUTWARD, THEY'RE
###1077 GOING TO BE LOOKING TO MAKE SOME MAJOR CHANGES IN THE FUTURE TO HELP OPEN THAT UP.
###1081 THIS IS A BIG PART OF DOING THAT, TO MAKE IT MORE INVITING FOR PEOPLE TO COME DOWN AND
###1085 ENJOY IT. >> >>PEGGY: HOW MUCH IS IT EXPECTED TO COST.
###1090 >> >>KEVIN FAULCONER: $14ÊMILLION CONSTRUCTION, GOING TO BE STARTING, AND WE TOLD FOLKS TODAY
###1093 LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THIS IN SPRING OF 2014. >> >>PEGGY: CITY COUNCIL MEMBER KEVIN FAULCONER.
###1101 YOU CAN TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE PLANS FOR HORTON PLAZA PARK ON OUR WEBSITE KPBS.ORG.
###1106 >> >>PEGGY: NO CHARGERS WILL BE SEEN ON LOCAL TV THIS WEEKEND FOR THE THIRD TIME THIS SEASON.
###1112 THE TEAM DID NOT SELL ENOUGH TICKETS TO AVOID AN NFL MANDATED TV BLACKOUT.
###1117 THERE ARE STILL 11,000 TICKETS AVAILABLE FOR SUNDAY'S GAME.
###1122 RIGHT NOW, THE CHARGERS RECORD IS FOUR WINS, AND SEVEN LOSSES.
###1127 AND THE BENGALS ARE FAVORED TO WIN THIS WEEKEND. TWINKIES MAY BE BACK IN LUNCH BOXES SOON.
###1133 HOST ESES, THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE SWEET TREATS SAY THEY'VE GOT MORE THAN 100 POTENTIAL
###1138 BUYERS FOR ITS PRODUCT LINE AS IT LIQUIDATES. MEAN WHILE, THE COMPANY IS SEEKING COURT APPROVAL
###1144 OF NEARLY $2ÊMILLION IN BONUSES FOR ITS TOP EXECUTIVES AS IT SHUTS DOWN.
###1150 HOST ES DECLARED BANKRUPTCY FOR THE SECOND TIME AFTER ITS BAKERS UNION WENT ON STRIKE
###1155 EARLIER THIS MONTH. THE UNION WANTS AN INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE TO OVER SEE THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDATION.
###1162 AND TOMORROW MARKS THE END OF THE LINE FOR A HISTORIC OYSTER FARM ON THE COAST OF NORTHERN
###1167 CALIFORNIA. THE DRAKE BAY OWES OYSTER COMPANY HAS BEEN
###1170 IN COMPANY FOR A HUNDRED YEARS. IT HAS 30 EMPLOYEES, BUT TODAY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT
###1178 OF THE INTERIOR SAID IT WOULD NOT RENEW THE COMPANY'S LEASE.
###1182 ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY THE OYSTER FARM THREATENED WILD LIFE.
###1186 THE LAND WILL BE RETURNED TO MOTHER NATURE AS A WILDERNESS SITE.
###1192 A HIGH SURF ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON.
###1198 STORMS IN THE PACIFIC ARE CAUSING THE HEAVY SURF.
###1201 WAVES REACHED ABOUT 7ÊFEET IN OCEAN BEACH EARLIER TODAY, AND ARE EXPECTED TO GET EVEN
###1205 HIGHER WITH PREDICTIONS UP TO 14ÊFEET ACCORDING TO SURF LINE.COM.
###1210 ALONG WITH THE HIGH SURF, THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SAYS WE CAN EXPECT A CHANCE OF SHOWERS
###1216 OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. HERE'S A LOOK AT THE FORECAST.
###1242 EARLIER IN THIS NEWS CAST WE TALKED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF SAN DIEGO'S WATER SUPPLY WITH
###1246 THE APPROVAL OF A CONTRACT TO BUY MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF DESALINATED WATER.
###1251 THAT'S THE FUTURE BUT KEN KRAMER TAKES US BACK TO SAN DIEGO'S WATER PAST.
###1256 >> >>: HERE IT IS, JUST A FEW PARTS OF IT REMAINING, ABOUT ALL THERE IS LEFT TO SEE
###1261 IN FACT OF WHAT WAS ONCE THIS. ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING STRUCTURES EVER BUILT
###1270 IN SAN DIEGO MADE OF 9ÊMILLION BOARD FEET OF RED WOOD IT WAS A 33 MILE LONG OPEN TRAIL
###1278 FLOWING WATER. I THINK YOU HAD TO SEE IT TO BELIEVE IT, BUT
###1281 AT LEAST THERE ARE PICTURES. SEE, IT USED TO BE IN SAN DIEGO THAT MOST
###1286 OF THE WATER WE DRANK AND USED FOR IRRIGATION CAME FROM WELLS AND IT WAS SALTY, SOMETIMES
###1291 NAUSEATING, NOT GOOD WATER, REALLY. BUT IN 1889, THIS BLOOM CHANGED EVERYTHING
###1298 AND IT WAS JUST AN ENORMOUS PROJECT TO BRING GOOD N WATER FROM THE MOUNTAINS FROM THE EASTERN
###1303 PART OF LA MESA AND ON TO SAN DIEGO. THERE HAD TO BE A DAM BUILT WAY UP ON THE
###1309 SAN DIEGO RIVER AT BOULDER CREAK. THAT'S WHERE THE WATER WAS CAPTURED TO BE
###1313 PUT IN THE FLUM. IT WAS SIX FEET WIDE, 18 INCHES DEEP, FULL
###1320 OF WATER, RUNNING ALL THOSE MILES, AND IT HAS H TO BE ALL DOWN HILL OF COURSE SO THE
###1325 WATER WOULD KEEP FLOWING. THERE WERE TUNNELS, HERE'S THE LOS COCHES
###1330 TUNNEL, AND MORE THAN 300TRESSELS, 1,000Ê 65ÊFEET HIGH, NOBODY HAD EVER SEEN ANYTHING
###1342 LIKE THAT IN SAN DIEGO. SO AMAZING WAS THIS THING THAT ON OPENING
###1347 DAY, 22ND OF FEBRUARY, 1889, PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND DIGNITARIES TOOK A RIDE ON WOODEN BOATS
###1355 DOWN A GOOD PART OF THE FLUME. THAT'S THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA, WHOSE NAME
###1360 INTERESTINGLY WAS ROBERT W.WATERMAN. THE FLUME WAS BUILT AND HAD TO BE MAINTAINED.
###1366 IT WAS WOOD, AND SOMETIMES LEAKED. SO YOU HAD FLUME WALKERS WHO SAW TROUBLE SPOTS,
###1373 AND MADE REPAIRS, INSPECTORS, AND HOUSES BUILT ALONG THE ROUTE SO THOSE WORKERS AND THEIR
###1380 FAMILIES HAD A PLACE TO LIVE. LOOKING BACK THERE WERE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH
###1385 THE SAN DIEGO FLUME. FOR ONE THING, IN THE HOT SUMMER MONTHS ALL
###1388 THAT WATER IN A SHALLOW CONTAINER MOVING ALONG, TOO MUCH OF THAT WATER EVAPORATED.
###1395 IN 1919 A WIND TUNNEL BLEW OVER THE SWEET WATER TRESSEL.
###1403 IN ITS TIME AND FOR ITS PURPOSE, IT DID ITS JOB.
###1406 THE WATER EVENTUALLY ENDING UP IN LA MESA RESERVOIR PIPED FROM THERE INTO SAN DIEGO.
###1411 LA MESA RESERVOIR WHICH WOULD LATER BE BUILT UP INTO WHAT WOULD BECOME LAKE MURRAY.
###1416 AND SOME OF THE WATER TOO WENT TO A RANCHER'S POND, SOMETIMES KNOWN AS DUCK POND.
###1421 IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO ANTHONY'S FISH GROTTO, YOU KNOW THE DUCK POND IS STILL THERE, EVEN
###1425 THOUGH THE FLUME IS GONE. IT JUST DIDN'T AGE WELL.
###1430 BY THE LATE 1920S, CUSTOMERS WERE DEMANDING REPAIRS AND THE STATE OF THE ART WATER DELIVERY
###1435 AND STORAGE HAD CHANGED. IN TIME DAMS WERE BUILT, THE LOWER OTAY, AND
###1441 MORENA, AND PIPES CYPHENS, AND CONCRETE TUNNELS REPLACED THE FLUME.
###1447 BUT WHAT A THING IT WAS. HERE'S OLD HIGHWAY 80 AND THE FLUME, NOW THE
###1452 LAKE JENNINGS PARK ROAD OFF RAMP, WHERE JUST UP THE ROAD AT THE LEAVY WATER TREATMENT PLANT,
###1459 THE HELIX WATER DISTRICT HAS KEPT A FEW BITS OF THE FLUME VISITORS CAN SEE, AN OLD WAGON
###1464 THAT ROLLED DOWN THE FLUME DURING THE CONSTRUCTION, AND THEN A SECTION, JUST A SECTION OF WHAT
###1473 WAS ONCE AN ENGINEERING MARVEL THAT DELIVERED GOOD, IT SWEET WATER FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND
###1480 BECAME A REMARKABLE PART OF HISTORY ABOUT SAN DIEGO.
###1486 >> >>PEGGY: YOU CAN SEE MORE OF KEN KRAMER'S STORY ABOUT SAN DIEGO TONIGHT AT 8:00ÊP.M.
###1494 RIGHT HERE ON KPBS. RECAPPING TONIGHT'S TOP STORIES, THE SAN DIEGO
###1499 COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY APPROVED A 30 YEAR DEAL TO BUY DESALINATED WATER FROM A PLANT
###1506 IN CARLSBAD. THE POSEIDON PLANT WILL BE THE LARGEST OF
###1509 ITS KIND IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. CONVERTING SEA WATER WILL GIVE US A MORE RELIABLE
###1514 SUPPLY. THE COST TO RATE PAYERS STILL ISN'T WORKED OUT.
###1520 AND DEMOLITION IS UNDERWAY AT HORTON PLAZA, THE OLD ROBINSON MAY BUILDING IS BEING TORN
###1526 DOWN TO MAKE WAY FOR A 14ÊMILLION DOLLAR PUBLIC PARK, ONE OF THE FINAL PROJECTS CREATED
###1531 BY SAN DIEGO'S NOW DEFUNCT REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY. SUPPORTER OF THE SAME SEX MARRIAGE BAN ARE APPEALING A LOWER
###1545 COURT RULING CLAIMING ITS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE COURT'S DECISION ON WHETHER TO HEAR THE
###1549 CASE IS EXPECTED ON MONDAY. IF THEY SAY NO, THE LAST RULING WILL STAND
###1554 TAKING PROP 8S OFF THE BOOKS. YOU CAN FIND ALL OF TONIGHT'S STORIES AND
###1558 MORE ON OUR WEBSITE KPBS.ORG/EVENINGEDITION. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND HAVE A GREAT
###1566 NIGHT.
