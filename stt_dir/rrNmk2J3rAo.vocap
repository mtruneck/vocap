###0 ROCCO CASTORO: So we bought this E-Meter--
###2 it's a Mark VII, I believe.
###6 We got it just because you're not supposed to have these
###8 unless you're a member of a certain organization that's
###13 responsible for their creation, courtesy of Hubbard
###16 Electrometer Manufacturing.
###18 I've always wanted one of these just because they're
###20 kind of goofy.
###21 And they supposedly will tell you certain information about
###26 your spiritual being.
###28 And if you've rid yourself of past spiritual experiences
###32 that were negative, and how whole of a person you are.
###37 
###45 The Hubbard Electrometer, more commonly known as the E-Meter,
###48 is a "religious artifact" used to measure the state of
###51 electrical characteristics in the static field
###53 surrounding the body.
###55 E-Meters operate in a similar fashion to lie detectors.
###58 Relying on a type of electrical circuit called a
###60 Wheatstone Bridge, which measures the subject's
###62 galvanic skin response.
###64 In short, the device produces a small electrical current and
###67 measures the subject's electrical
###68 resistance to that current.
###70 
###75 Wilbert?
###76 WILBERT: Yeah?
###77 ROCCO CASTORO: Please come over and
###77 get an E-Meter reading.
###79 WILBERT: [INAUDIBLE].
###80 ROCCO CASTORO: Pick them up again, take
###81 them off the table.
###81 OK, if it rises, the dial moves to the left, that means
###84 that you're non-confrontational, your fear
###87 or responsibility or
###89 identification is coming through.
###91 If it moves to the right, that means you've got losses, lies,
###95 present time problems, and a disagreement with reality.
###98 OK, so it moves to the right, which it's doing, I think
###101 Wilbert's got a disagreement with reality.
###103 Considering that Wilbert was spiritually void, I decided
###106 that a wider group of test subjects was needed.
###108 And headed out to Union Square, where I told people
###110 whether or not they were good individuals.
###111 
###116 This is a sign we made before we came.
###118 I just want to make sure people know we're not "those"
###121 guys, if that makes sense.
###123 I'm winking.
###123 You can't see it under my sunglasses.
###125 
###132 Now, don't tell anyone, but we've commandeered some public
###135 electricity from the park here.
###138 We don't know if we're going to get fined or
###141 arrested for that.
###142 Hopefully we at least get a few meter readings beforehand.
###147 Ladies, would you be liking a free E-Meter reading?
###149 Would you like to have a free E-Meter reading?
###151 Ma'am, would you like a free E-Meter reading?
###152 Come get your E-Meter readings.
###154 E-Meter readings right here.
###157 This is so fucking silly.
###159 Get your E-Meter readings!
###160 Hi.
###161 FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi.
###161 ROCCO CASTORO: Are you interested in E-Meters?
###163 You're just going to grip these as so, very lightly.
###168 Oh, wow.
###170 You got some energy.
###172 If you could transport to a time period, any time period
###175 throughout history, and off the top of your head, what
###177 would it be?
###177 FEMALE SPEAKER: Harlem Renaissance.
###178 MALE SPEAKER: 1930.
###179 ROCCO CASTORO: So dinosaurs, you said?
###181 FEMALE SPEAKER: Dinosaurs, yeah.
###181 ROCCO CASTORO: OK.
###182 MALE SPEAKER: I'd have said 1950.
###183 ROCCO CASTORO: Why 1950?
###186 MALE SPEAKER: Well, I guess I like retro.
###189 I've developed more of a sense for vintage things since I've
###193 seen all these hipsters.
###194 ROCCO CASTORO: Is that right?
###196 From antiquity, basically.
###197 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###198 And it just feels familiar.
###199 ROCCO CASTORO: Do you feel like you might have been
###201 around during that time in a past life?
###202 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.
###203 ROCCO CASTORO: Yeah?
###203 Do you have any inclination of what you might have done?
###206 And you're falling right now.
###207 So it looks like if you were, it was a traumatic experience
###210 of some sort.
###211 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, there was, but I don't
###214 want to get into it.
###215 ROCCO CASTORO: It was bad though?
###216 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###216 ROCCO CASTORO: Do you think that whatever happened to you
###218 then that was a negative experience has impeded you in
###223 this life in some way?
###224 FEMALE SPEAKER: Has it affected decisions I've made
###226 in this lifetime?
###227 Yes.
###227 The answer is yes.
###228 FEMALE SPEAKER: I thought maybe these rings were messing
###230 it up because you got me nervous.
###232 ROCCO CASTORO: Well, you're not supposed to have rings on.
###233 But this whole thing's complete bullshit anyway, so
###235 it doesn't matter.
###236 Like what's your favorite color?
###237 MALE SPEAKER Red.
###238 ROCCO CASTORO: OK.
###239 It's dropping, so that kind of means you might be lying.
###242 What's your name?
###243 ALZEENA: Alzeena.
###243 ROCCO CASTORO: Alzeena, OK.
###245 And it looks like you're kind of lying about that.
###247 Are you sure that's your name?
###248 ALZEENA: This might be some BS, because that is my name.
###252 ROCCO CASTORO: OK.
###252 So that does show you're a good person.
###254 FEMALE SPEAKER: Glad to hear that.
###256 Not that I needed proof.
###257 ROCCO CASTORO: No, you didn't.
###259 But apparently certain people believe that
###262 this is proof of that.
###263 So I'm not sure what to say about that.
###265 FEMALE SPEAKER: Good for them.
###266 ROCCO CASTORO: Good for them, right?
###266 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###267 MALE SPEAKER: So now, am I a good person?
###268 ROCCO CASTORO: You're at 2.56.
###270 So would you consider yourself a good person?
###272 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes, I do.
###273 ROCCO CASTORO: You do?
###274 FEMALE SPEAKER: Falling.
###276 ROCCO CASTORO: It is falling.
###278 Would you consider yourself a good person?
###279 MALE SPEAKER: Yes.
###280 ROCCO CASTORO: Let's say somebody beats up your mom or
###283 your sister.
###284 You have a chance to send the guy to jail, or you can kick
###287 the shit out of him for an hour and
###288 then send him to jail.
###289 Which would you rather do?
###290 MALE SPEAKER: I'll send him to jail.
###292 ROCCO CASTORO: Oh, look!
###293 He's fucking lying!
###294 MALE SPEAKER: Nice.
###296 ROCCO CASTORO: I think we've got a good fix
###298 on your moral character.
###299 The majority of the subjects I tested seemed to believe my
###302 E-Meter readings wholeheartedly, which makes me
###304 think that true auditors are full of shit.
###307 So, oh wow, you're really just--
###310 FEMALE SPEAKER: What does that mean?
###311 Is that bad?
###311 ROCCO CASTORO: It's kind of bad.
###313 FEMALE SPEAKER: So what does that mean?
###314 ROCCO CASTORO: I don't know.
###314 FEMALE SPEAKER: What do you mean you don't know?
###316 ROCCO CASTORO: I don't know what any of this means.
###316 I'm just making it up, kind of.
###318 How old are you?
###319 FEMALE SPEAKER: 30.
###319 ROCCO CASTORO: 30, OK.
###320 Oh, you're telling the truth.
###322 Oh, maybe not.
###323 Maybe something bad happened to you.
###325 FEMALE SPEAKER: I was probably a heroin addict.
###326 ROCCO CASTORO: It seems like you're pretty at peace with
###328 yourself, and there are no evil engrams eating
###332 away at your soul.
###333 FEMALE SPEAKER: Really?
###333 ROCCO CASTORO: Yeah.
###333 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh.
###334 So I would have thought the opposite.
###335
