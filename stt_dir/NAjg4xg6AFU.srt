CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: We have a lot of ground
to cover today. Asia, Australia, the Middle

0:0:7,979 --> 0:0:14,639
East, North America - even what could be the
edge of the solar system. Let`s go.

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: Today I want to make it absolutely


5
0:0:27,72 --> 0:0:34,46
clear to Assad and those under his command,
the world is watching. The use of chemical


6
0:0:34,46 --> 0:0:39,51
weapons is and would be totally unacceptable.


7
0:0:39,51 --> 0:0:46,739
And if you make the tragic mistake of using
these weapons, there will be consequences.


8
0:0:46,739 --> 0:0:47,829
And you will be held accountable.


9
0:0:47,829 --> 0:0:48,35

10
0:0:48,35 --> 0:0:53,559
AZUZ: That was President Obama on Monday talking
about Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. There


11
0:0:53,559 --> 0:0:58,969
are concerns that al-Assad`s government forces
might use chemical weapons, like poison gas


12
0:0:58,969 --> 0:1:4,55
in its fight against rebels in Syria`s ongoing
civil war. Syrian officials say the government


13
0:1:4,55 --> 0:1:8,59
doesn`t have any plans to use those kinds
of weapons. The fighting in Syria, though,


14
0:1:8,59 --> 0:1:13,25
is not letting up. You can see some of the
damage here in the Syrian city of Aleppo.


15
0:1:13,25 --> 0:1:18,91
Reports say more than 42,000 Syrians have
been killed since the civil war started 21


16
0:1:18,91 --> 0:1:19,88
months ago.


17
0:1:19,88 --> 0:1:24,77
This picture was taken from the international
space station. The giant white spiral, that`s


18
0:1:24,77 --> 0:1:29,71
a typhoon, it`s the same kind of storm as
a hurricane. This one is called Bopha, and


19
0:1:29,71 --> 0:1:35,39
it`s huge. At one point on Monday it was a
super typhoon, the same size and speed as


20
0:1:35,39 --> 0:1:41,85
a category five hurricane. Yesterday, it hit
the Philippines. This is some of what it left


21
0:1:41,85 --> 0:1:46,29
behind: massive flooding, landslides, homes
destroyed, more than two dozen people were


22
0:1:46,29 --> 0:1:51,37
killed and more than 50,000 have been affected
by the typhoon. A lot of the communities in


23
0:1:51,37 --> 0:1:55,83
Bopha`s path weren`t prepared for it before
the typhoon hit. Government agencies tried


24
0:1:55,83 --> 0:2:0,16
to get people out of the way and to get relief
supplies and emergency crews in place to help


25
0:2:0,16 --> 0:2:0,97
out afterward.


26
0:2:0,97 --> 0:2:6,69
Less than four weeks to go, and still, no
deal in D.C. Yes, we are talking about the


27
0:2:6,69 --> 0:2:11,39
fiscal cliff, the series of automatic government
spending cuts and tax increases that will


28
0:2:11,39 --> 0:2:16,78
take place on January First, if President
Obama and Congress can`t agree on ways to


29
0:2:16,78 --> 0:2:18,92
cut the nation`s debt.


30
0:2:18,92 --> 0:2:24,299
We don`t have a deal, we do have a proposal.
Two of them, in fact. President Obama offered


31
0:2:24,299 --> 0:2:29,769
his plan last week, Republican leaders rejected
it. Republicans offered a counter plan this


32
0:2:29,769 --> 0:2:34,54
week. The president rejected it. There are
some ideas that both sides agree on, but the


33
0:2:34,54 --> 0:2:39,6
two big sticking points are government spending
and tax rates for Americans who make more


34
0:2:39,6 --> 0:2:44,29
than $250,000 a year. So, right now we have
proposals, but no agreement.

classes at Maize South High School in Wichita,
Kansas.


38
0:2:53,969 --> 0:3:1,219
"Which of these was launched into space first?
Here we go. Was it the Curiosity Rover, International


39
0:3:1,219 --> 0:3:10,49
Space Station, Voyager I spacecraft of space
shuttle Discovery. You`ve got three seconds,


40
0:3:10,49 --> 0:3:12,659
go!


41
0:3:12,659 --> 0:3:21,51
Voyager One was first taking off on September
Fifth, 1977. That`s your answer and that`s


42
0:3:21,51 --> 0:3:22,659
your "Shoutout."

(END VIDEO CLIP)


44
0:3:24,389 --> 0:3:30,419
AZUZ: A 35-year road trip, and it`s not going
to be over any time soon. Voyager I is getting


45
0:3:30,419 --> 0:3:35,969
ready to leave the Solar System? Or maybe,
let`s go back to start. When it launched in


46
0:3:35,969 --> 0:3:40,529
1977 few people could have imagined that Voyager
might tell us more about our Solar System


47
0:3:40,529 --> 0:3:45,23
than any other spacecraft. The main mission
was to explore Jupiter and Saturn. It did


48
0:3:45,23 --> 0:3:50,799
that. And NASA decided to just let the thing
keep on going. Past the other planets, heading


49
0:3:50,799 --> 0:3:56,19
toward interstellar space. That means out
of our Solar System. NASA officials thought


50
0:3:56,19 --> 0:4:1,709
it was almost at the border, but than on Monday
when it was about 11 billion miles from the


51
0:4:1,709 --> 0:4:6,579
Sun, Voyager sent back some surprising news.
Sorry, all, it turns out the Solar System


52
0:4:6,579 --> 0:4:11,749
is bigger than we thought. Voyager has traveled
farther in the space than any other man-made


53
0:4:11,749 --> 0:4:16,959
object, but it`s going to have to keep on
going to bust out of the Solar System. NASA`s


54
0:4:16,959 --> 0:4:21,549
new prediction is that it could happen in
the few months or a couple of years.


55
0:4:21,549 --> 0:4:26,229
Imagine the life of a presidential nominee:
for months of campaigning, TV cameras follow


56
0:4:26,229 --> 0:4:31,25
your every move. There are these giant cheering
crowds everywhere you go. And then you get


57
0:4:31,25 --> 0:4:35,729
to election night, and if you end up on the
short hand of the electoral college count,


58
0:4:35,729 --> 0:4:40,15
everything stops. What is it like to lose
the presidential election and what do you


59
0:4:40,15 --> 0:4:42,91
do after that? Lisa Sylvester takes a look.

LISA SYLVESTER, CBS CORRESPONDENT: They are
a hair away from the highest office of the

0:4:46,65 --> 0:4:46,86
land.


63
0:4:46,86 --> 0:4:53,12
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The next president of the
United States of America Mitt Romney!


64
0:4:53,12 --> 0:4:56,36
SYLVESTER: Then suddenly, it`s over. Mitt
Romney joins the list of the almost but not


65
0:4:56,36 --> 0:5:3,21
quite, along with Senator John McCain, Senator
John Kerry, former Vice President Al Gore,


66
0:5:3,21 --> 0:5:6,18
former Governor Michael Dukakis, and former
Senator Bob Dole.


67
0:5:6,18 --> 0:5:9,419
DOUGLAS BRINKLEY, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:
In Great Britain, if somebody like Mitt Romney,


68
0:5:9,419 --> 0:5:13,139
you know, after they lost, they would be able
to go in the House of Lords, kind of a wise


69
0:5:13,139 --> 0:5:17,569
men council. We don`t have it in the United
States. When you lose, you lose.


70
0:5:17,569 --> 0:5:18,81
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R ), ARIZONA: That alone.


71
0:5:18,81 --> 0:5:22,979
SYLVESTER: Reinvention can take different
forms. Senators McCain and Kerry have their


72
0:5:22,979 --> 0:5:27,53
day jobs to return to on Capitol Hill. In
fact, Kerry`s name is now being floated for


73
0:5:27,53 --> 0:5:30,699
secretary of state replacing Hillary Clinton.


74
0:5:30,699 --> 0:5:36,33
Vice President Al Gore made global warming
his calling, winning the 2007 Nobel Peace


75
0:5:36,33 --> 0:5:42,58
Prize, Gore also promoted sustainable investing
and co- founded current TV. Bob Dole has been


76
0:5:42,58 --> 0:5:46,68
a special council at a top law firm.


77
0:5:46,68 --> 0:5:52,99
Moving from the political life back to civilian
life can be tricky. Take Mitt Romney, he had


78
0:5:52,99 --> 0:5:55,99
round the clock secret service protection,
a legion of followers.


79
0:5:55,99 --> 0:5:57,5
(applause)


80
0:5:57,5 --> 0:6:4,319
SYLVESTER: Crowds of thousands chanting his
name. And then, nothing.


81
0:6:4,319 --> 0:6:8,65
Former congressman Mark Kennedy who now heads
up George Washington University`s Graduate


82
0:6:8,65 --> 0:6:11,84
School of Political Management offers this
sage advice:


83
0:6:11,84 --> 0:6:15,9
MARK KENNEDY, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: I think
what makes a difference is having a focus:


84
0:6:15,9 --> 0:6:19,659
you mentioned Al Gore. He focused on environmental
issues. If you look at John Kerry who`s focuses


85
0:6:19,659 --> 0:6:24,97
on foreign policy issues. If you pick some
piece of your message that did resonate with


86
0:6:24,97 --> 0:6:30,259
the American people and after a pause come
back and start emphasizing that in important


87
0:6:30,259 --> 0:6:35,759
ways, that I think is the path to really helping
to make a difference after you run.

I`m a geographic landmark that`s also a popular
tourist attraction. I`m home to thousands


92
0:6:47,159 --> 0:6:52,639
of different species. I`m located off the
coast of Australia and I`m the world`s largest

0:6:56,699 --> 0:7:4,159
I`m the Great Barrier Reef. And I cover around

AZUZ: One group is trying to map out every
inch of the Great Barrier Reef, and they are


97
0:7:11,28 --> 0:7:15,46
posting the pictures online. Sure, it`s a
way for people who can`t visit in person to


98
0:7:15,46 --> 0:7:19,689
see the world`s largest coral reef, but the
point of this project isn`t just for people


99
0:7:19,689 --> 0:7:24,789
to see the reef, is to help keep it from disappearing.
Philippe Cousteau dives into the details.

PHILIPPE COUSTEAU: We are in the water with
the researchers of the Catlin Seaview Survey.


102
0:7:30,59 --> 0:7:36,55
Their mission map the world`s coral reefs
creating a comprehensive study for scientists


103
0:7:36,55 --> 0:7:40,83
while giving the rest of us a chance to see
their work in real time.


104
0:7:40,83 --> 0:7:48,199
360 degree panoramic images that will soon
be used by researchers monitoring the effects


105
0:7:48,199 --> 0:7:54,58
of climate change are already available on
Google maps. And a social media campaign connects


106
0:7:54,58 --> 0:7:59,509
the team with more than 2 million followers
online.


107
0:7:59,509 --> 0:8:6,61
Coral reefs are source of food and income
for over 500 million people in more than 50


108
0:8:6,61 --> 0:8:13,99
countries. But for most of us, they remain
out of sight and out of mind. And the neglect


109
0:8:13,99 --> 0:8:20,37
is taking its toll. Overfishing, pollution,
warming ocean temperatures have all contributed


110
0:8:20,37 --> 0:8:24,37
to what scientists are discovering is the
reefs` rapid decline.


111
0:8:24,37 --> 0:8:29,229
OVE HOEGH-GULDBERG, CHIEF SCIENTIST: We had
a paper published on it at the (inaudible)


112
0:8:29,229 --> 0:8:32,849
Sciences that shows that half of the coral
in the Great Barrier Reef has disappeared


113
0:8:32,849 --> 0:8:38,62
over the last 27 years. That`s a momentous
change. And if continue on that pathway, the


114
0:8:38,62 --> 0:8:41,159
Great Barrier Reef will largely not have coral
on it.


115
0:8:41,159 --> 0:8:46,7
COUSTEAU: The Catlin team says waiting to
share results simply is not an option. The


116
0:8:46,7 --> 0:8:51,94
future health of the reefs needs to be understood
now and not just by researchers.


117
0:8:51,94 --> 0:8:56,68
RICHARD VEVERS, PROJECT DIRECTOR: There is
amazing scientific work being done, but it`s


118
0:8:56,68 --> 0:9:3,97
being read by up to sort of 100 people around
the world. And we wanted to bridge this gap,


119
0:9:3,97 --> 0:9:9,459
well, we need to bridge this gap between scientific
awareness and public understanding.

121
0:9:10,55 --> 0:9:16,6
AZUZ: Before we go, dogs like to splash around
in water. But this guy might want to rethink


122
0:9:16,6 --> 0:9:21,209
his choice of play pals. That is a killer
whale. The close encounter in this Youtube


123
0:9:21,209 --> 0:9:26,41
video happened in New Zealand. Luckily, the
dog did get to safety in time, although turning


124
0:9:26,41 --> 0:9:30,389
around and barking back at the whale might
not have been the best decision. We`d say


125
0:9:30,389 --> 0:9:34,589
the whale should pick on someone its own size,
but that doesn`t leave many options. Maybe


126
0:9:34,589 --> 0:9:39,1
the thing he was just lonely and just wanted
some company. When the dog swam away, the


127
0:9:39,1 --> 0:9:43,73
massive mammal was just this blubbering mess.
It brings us to the finish line for today,


128
0:9:43,73 --> 0:11:43,73
but we whale be back tomorrow with more CNN
STUDENT NEWS. See you then.
