1
0:0:0,11 --> 0:0:3,949
now some democrats are outreach today
that i'm sporting reimpose filibuster of


2
0:0:3,949 --> 0:0:6,47
john brennan to be the head of the
c_i_a_


3
0:0:6,47 --> 0:0:8,899
uh... because


4
0:0:8,899 --> 0:0:11,609
he had to be a hundred percent right
that we have a giant constitutional


5
0:0:11,609 --> 0:0:12,439
issue


6
0:0:12,439 --> 0:0:15,739
that uh... eric holder of said we can do


7
0:0:15,739 --> 0:0:18,83
drawn strikes on u_s_ citizens on u_s_
soil


8
0:0:18,83 --> 0:0:20,88
without a trial


9
0:0:20,88 --> 0:0:24,24
if you are an actual progressive or a
liberal


10
0:0:24,24 --> 0:0:27,339
you would find that


11
0:0:27,339 --> 0:0:29,269
agents and clearly


12
0:0:29,269 --> 0:0:31,29
obviously unconstitutional


13
0:0:31,29 --> 0:0:32,6
as some of you have


14
0:0:32,6 --> 0:0:33,31
if u


15
0:0:33,31 --> 0:0:36,89
well i don't care about principles and
you're not actually a progressive or


16
0:0:36,89 --> 0:0:37,7
liberal


17
0:0:37,7 --> 0:0:41,23
you just uh... democrat and you like
being a team democrat you like wearing


18
0:0:41,23 --> 0:0:42,63
the blue outfits


19
0:0:42,63 --> 0:0:46,29
and with the big olin hope in changi
like you can see slogans


20
0:0:46,29 --> 0:0:50,23
well then you would be opposed iran paul
because you're not a principled person


21
0:0:50,23 --> 0:0:51,96
you're just go along with


22
0:0:51,96 --> 0:0:53,819
inside asia have some pompoms


23
0:0:53,819 --> 0:0:56,4
'cause your job is really a cheerleader


24
0:0:56,4 --> 0:0:58,56
what does my dear leader robots eight


25
0:0:58,56 --> 0:1:0,8
april u_s_ electron


26
0:1:0,8 --> 0:1:1,51
also


27
0:1:1,51 --> 0:1:5,74
i don't buy them to be awesome i fight
it'd be despicable


28
0:1:5,74 --> 0:1:10,6
i'll go as far as say i'm really glad
that ran paul who i disagree with ninety


29
0:1:10,6 --> 0:1:12,1
percent of the time


30
0:1:12,1 --> 0:1:15,74
has one that seat in kentucky now the
democrat had one that see do you think


31
0:1:15,74 --> 0:1:18,58
it will lead a filibuster against
president bombers unconstitutional


32
0:1:18,58 --> 0:1:19,93
actions


33
0:1:19,93 --> 0:1:22,6
you know they have said that


34
0:1:22,6 --> 0:1:25,7
and as much as i disagree a grand paul


35
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:27,82
ons so many different issues


36
0:1:27,82 --> 0:1:32,43
what he's doing here is monumentally
important


37
0:1:32,43 --> 0:1:34,62
without further ado let's hear from
rental


38
0:1:34,62 --> 0:1:35,53
the fact


39
0:1:35,53 --> 0:1:39,86
the deal bomb administration has told
the u_s_ senator that there is a


40
0:1:39,86 --> 0:1:45,73
circumstance where the government could
target and kill an american citizen


41
0:1:45,73 --> 0:1:50,89
on american soil without charge and
without trial


42
0:1:50,89 --> 0:1:55,7
is a stark example of an imperial
presidency


43
0:1:55,7 --> 0:1:58,72
if there were an counts of courage in
this body


44
0:1:58,72 --> 0:2:4,74
i would be joined by many other senators
saying that they will not tolerate this


45
0:2:4,74 --> 0:2:9,14
that we will come together today in
bipartisan fashion and tell the


46
0:2:9,14 --> 0:2:12,459
president tell any president


47
0:2:12,459 --> 0:2:16,429
that no president will ever have the
authority to kill americans without a


48
0:2:16,429 --> 0:2:17,699
trial


49
0:2:17,699 --> 0:2:18,839
damn straight


50
0:2:18,839 --> 0:2:22,979
he's a hundred percent right about that
as we are live on there right now he's


51
0:2:22,979 --> 0:2:25,559
missed half hour that this filibuster


52
0:2:25,559 --> 0:2:27,26
and how many senators have joined him


53
0:2:27,26 --> 0:2:28,509
seven others


54
0:2:28,509 --> 0:2:31,519
putting only one democrat ron white


55
0:2:31,519 --> 0:2:35,339
once again missing-in-action are all
those soap operas of democrats played


56
0:2:35,339 --> 0:2:37,889
bernie sanders was with warren et cetera


57
0:2:37,889 --> 0:2:40,29
so now rantoul explains


58
0:2:40,29 --> 0:2:41,729
whereas


59
0:2:41,729 --> 0:2:45,629
president i'll bomb of all people but of
two thousand seven great point here


60
0:2:45,629 --> 0:2:48,709
i'm a republican i didn't vote or
support the president


61
0:2:48,709 --> 0:2:50,169
by the time


62
0:2:50,169 --> 0:2:51,529
but i've marin


63
0:2:51,529 --> 0:2:54,269
vertically in two thousand seven many
men


64
0:2:54,269 --> 0:2:58,309
i admired his uh... ability to stand up
and say we want to work for people


65
0:2:58,309 --> 0:3:2,29
that's not what america does how does
the president's mind work the uh... the


66
0:3:2,29 --> 0:3:4,239
presidency and so on the wall


67
0:3:4,239 --> 0:3:8,579
seem so concerned with all rights seem
so concerned with the right not to have


68
0:3:8,579 --> 0:3:10,239
your phone with that


69
0:3:10,239 --> 0:3:14,149
now says he's not concerned with whether
you can be killed without a trial


70
0:3:14,149 --> 0:3:18,529
where is the brocco bomb of two thousand
seven


71
0:3:18,529 --> 0:3:20,39
great question


72
0:3:20,39 --> 0:3:22,659
well that bravo obama no longer exists


73
0:3:22,659 --> 0:3:24,809
if it ever existed


74
0:3:24,809 --> 0:3:28,439
one possible theory is that he was lying
all long an entire by the wire tapping


75
0:3:28,439 --> 0:3:29,209
in fact


76
0:3:29,209 --> 0:3:32,739
we know that he gave a pass to the big
telecom companies


77
0:3:32,739 --> 0:3:38,39
during the primaries e_s_l_ ur clinton
he's an old filibuster doughnut


78
0:3:38,39 --> 0:3:42,89
and then after the primaries are over no
i don't get away with it


79
0:3:42,89 --> 0:3:45,449
of course he led the bush administration
there were all there was like any of


80
0:3:45,449 --> 0:3:49,79
that president obama does what was
wiretapping himself right now


81
0:3:49,79 --> 0:3:51,339
cid ministration revels in it


82
0:3:51,339 --> 0:3:54,369
the indefinite detention is willing to
sign and the national defense


83
0:3:54,369 --> 0:3:55,38
authorization act


84
0:3:55,38 --> 0:3:58,72
which allows for the indefinite
detention of u_s_ citizens by the


85
0:3:58,72 --> 0:3:59,779
military


86
0:3:59,779 --> 0:4:2,299
let alone on u_s_ citizens and now


87
0:4:2,299 --> 0:4:4,14
he is out cheney cheney


88
0:4:4,14 --> 0:4:6,559
and he says i get back security
residences


89
0:4:6,559 --> 0:4:7,859
on u_s_ soil


90
0:4:7,859 --> 0:4:13,349
due process be damned what happened all
bomb of two thousand seven what c l_


91
0:4:13,349 --> 0:4:15,519
lion


92
0:4:15,519 --> 0:4:18,449
or did he somehow change


93
0:4:18,449 --> 0:4:21,18
i doubt we'll get an answer from the
president on that in either


94
0:4:21,18 --> 0:4:22,44
doesn't seem very open


95
0:4:22,44 --> 0:4:26,29
although of course he is running the
most transparent administration in


96
0:4:26,29 --> 0:4:27,239
history


97
0:4:27,239 --> 0:4:28,52
laugh along with me


98
0:4:28,52 --> 0:4:30,8
one more break or from rempel


99
0:4:30,8 --> 0:4:34,349
now when the president says he doesn't
intend to do so


100
0:4:34,349 --> 0:4:38,789
you really have to think that the route
he wants us to remember in thing could


101
0:4:38,789 --> 0:4:42,8
have him because he says i don't intend
to do so


102
0:4:42,8 --> 0:4:44,479
well it's not enough


103
0:4:44,479 --> 0:4:48,139
i mean would you tolerate a republican
who stood up and said


104
0:4:48,139 --> 0:4:54,55
well i'd like the first amendment on
um... quite fond of the first amendment


105
0:4:54,55 --> 0:4:59,139
and i don't intend to break the first
amendment but i might what conservatives


106
0:4:59,139 --> 0:5:2,809
tolerate someone is that i like the
second amendment


107
0:5:2,809 --> 0:5:7,809
i think it's important and i'm poor guy
membership and i don't intend about the


108
0:5:7,809 --> 0:5:9,599
second amendment


109
0:5:9,599 --> 0:5:11,169
but i might


110
0:5:11,169 --> 0:5:12,63
when we tolerate


111
0:5:12,63 --> 0:5:16,759
but he doesn't intend to do so as a
standard


112
0:5:16,759 --> 0:5:19,25
i've been fighting online all day on
this issue


113
0:5:19,25 --> 0:5:20,15
and so


114
0:5:20,15 --> 0:5:24,32
democrats china go well you have a
single case a bit


115
0:5:24,32 --> 0:5:29,37
president expiry u_s_ citizen on u_s_
soil yet


116
0:5:29,37 --> 0:5:31,529
he just has the authority to do so


117
0:5:31,529 --> 0:5:35,469
apparently you fundamentally miss
understand our process an art form of


118
0:5:35,469 --> 0:5:36,33
government


119
0:5:36,33 --> 0:5:39,849
you know just give the president the
right to do that and then hope he


120
0:5:39,849 --> 0:5:43,61
doesn't use it well why don't we just
have a king instead and get them all


121
0:5:43,61 --> 0:5:45,119
those words in fact


122
0:5:45,119 --> 0:5:50,58
the magna carta was designed to make
sure it became didn't have love specific


123
0:5:50,58 --> 0:5:51,769
rights


124
0:5:51,769 --> 0:5:53,66
we're going back now in history


125
0:5:53,66 --> 0:5:54,999
past the magna carta


126
0:5:54,999 --> 0:5:58,9
this is one of foundations of western
democracy


127
0:5:58,9 --> 0:6:1,819
and nobody administration is apparently
gleefully


128
0:6:1,819 --> 0:6:6,27
tearing it down and any progressive or
liberal that supports them doesn't


129
0:6:6,27 --> 0:6:8,71
understand what it means to be a
progressive or liberal


130
0:6:8,71 --> 0:6:10,319
at all


131
0:6:10,319 --> 0:6:12,84
so this is something i should be crossed
partisan


132
0:6:12,84 --> 0:6:17,99
libertarians lybrand paul conservatives
who care about the constitution and


133
0:6:17,99 --> 0:6:21,639
liberals we should all agree on this
buses bush did it l baba dead out


134
0:6:21,639 --> 0:6:22,729
fortunately


135
0:6:22,729 --> 0:6:26,8
mostly country agrees uh... the
constitution bidet


136
0:6:26,8 --> 0:6:28,6
has already team leaders


137
0:6:28,6 --> 0:8:28,6
told otis it was ok i'd love that ran
paul says it is not ok
