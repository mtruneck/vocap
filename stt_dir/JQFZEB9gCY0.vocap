###30 Hi, welcome back to the show.
###32 This episode is about a New Year's trip we took to Mexico.
###36 We went to Spanky's dad's house who has a really cool
###39 surf shack overlooking the ocean.
###43 Oh, and also Jerry Hsu came along on this trip.
###46 And you might know Jerry from his part in the Enjoi video,
###49 which I think is one of the best video parts of all time.
###53 And we're going to ask him a little bit about that.
###55 The rest is just home movies.
###57 It's just a little bit of video from our vacation in
###61 Mexico for New Year's Eve.
###65 JON LONG: We're Kilometer 55.
###66 I probably don't want to say that, I probably want to say
###68 Kilometer 85.
###71 JERRY HSU: I don't know, it's just
###73 gangster beachfront property.
###76 It's actually just a converted trailer,
###78 but it's pretty awesome.
###80 No electricity.
###83 MALE SPEAKER: None of our phones work.
###84 JERRY HSU: None of our phones work.
###86 We make quesadillas.
###87 
###90 CHRIS SHONTING: It's fairly amazing.
###92 There's a surf spot in every single-- well,
###95 left to right direction.
###97 When the tide goes out you can prod animals in the sea in
###103 tide pools.
###105 MALE SPEAKER: He's so bummed, there he goes.
###108 Ah!
###108 Dude, you popped it!
###110 It's leaking.
###112 CHRIS SHONTING: There was a guy catching octopuses out
###113 there earlier and just kind of smashing them.
###115 MALE SPEAKER: Whoa!
###116 
###118 KEVIN LONG: Pulled out an octopus, beat it with his
###122 metal stick, and then ripped off one of the limbs, and then
###125 threw it in his bucket and kept going.
###127 MALE SPEAKER: Calamari.
###130 MALE SPEAKER: I'm going to take all of this footage of
###132 Jerry walking on the beach and I'm going to put
###134 on really sad music.
###137 CHRIS SHONTING: Little delicate genius.
###141 When he falls on a skateboard, I start crying.
###144 You feel like you're going to see someone die if he falls,
###147 because it's always the worst fall.
###150 Yeah, he bounces back-- like, I've see his chin explode and
###155 I felt it right in my nuts.
###157 You know, you just land and like your feet, your
###159 board's just gone.
###160 JERRY HSU: Ah!
###163 God!
###164 Fuck!
###166 CHRIS SHONTING: I'm always freaked out, but I'm amazed.
###169 I don't know.
###170 
###173 JERRY HSU: No, I haven't skated in like-- well, I've
###176 skated, but I've been taking kind of an extended vacation
###180 for like a year.
###182 Yeah, everyone was like, you should just take a break.
###185 And I was like, all right.
###186 Yeah, it's kind of weird.
###188 I actually--
###189 the last six months of it was really when I
###190 did the most of it.
###193 For like a year and a half I was just like, la de da, blah,
###197 blah, blah.
###197 But then the last six months is always like, OK, every
###200 single weekend just destroy myself.
###203 
###207 [GROAN].
###209 
###212 God!
###214 [SCREAM].
###219 MALE SPEAKER: Whoa!
###222 Ah!
###223 Jerry!
###225 JERRY HSU: All the big cheeses and stuff, they're like, OK,
###228 your part's pretty cool but we need like
###231 the last, last thing.
###232 And I was like, OK.
###234 So I went and I tried it one day and I got hurt.
###239 [SCREAM].
###242 And I was like, fuck, I'm hurt.
###244 And it was like the last month I could film and
###248 I got hurt on that.
###249 And then for like one month straight I was just
###251 thinking about it.
###251 Like, oh man, I got to go back and do that.
###253 And I was super scared that I was going to jump down it once
###257 and just be like, can't do it.
###260 
###263 I don't know.
###264 Probably like 20?
###269 25 or something?
###270 But I don't know.
###271 I never really think about how many tries
###272 it takes to do something.
###274 I kind of just zone out.
###278 Ow!
###279 
###281 [SHOUTS].
###283 
###288 MALE SPEAKER: Oh!
###290 [WHISTLE].
###291 Come on, Jerry, right back at it.
###292 Get this thing.
###293 JERRY HSU: Matt, the brand manager, he was stressing out
###297 because he made the video.
###298 And then he turned to me and he was just like, well, just
###301 go do that fucking trick down those stairs.
###304 And I got so mad, and I was like, I'll show him.
###308 I'm going to do that trick.
###309 MALE SPEAKER: Do you have any New Year's resolutions?
###311 JERRY HSU: No, I should probably start skating again.
###314 EVERYONE: Four, three, two, one.
###318 MALE SPEAKER: Happy new year!
###320 [CHEERING].
###321 
###323 MALE SPEAKER: Happy new year!
###325 
###327 FEMALE SPEAKER: Happy new year!
###330 JON LONG: Paddy, me boy.
###333 FEMALE SPEAKER: Happy new year, Jon!
###334 JON LONG: Happy new year, fucker.
###335 PATRICK O'DELL: Happy New Year's.
###337 
###344 FEMALE SPEAKER: Happy new year!
###346 
###348 MALE SPEAKER: Happy new year!
###349 JON LONG: What's yours, fucker?
###351 PATRICK O'DELL: I don't have one.
###352 
###355 FEMALE SPEAKER: Happy new year, Johnson!
###357 
###361 CHRIS SHONTING: Mr. Long, he's one of those dudes that's
###364 honestly epic.
###367 There's no posturing into epicness.
###370 Or no becoming epic over the course of the day, by the end
###375 of the day being epic.
###376 It's kind of like, wake up and just be epic.
###379 I don't know.
###381 I'm impressed.
###382 
###384 JON LONG: I'm going to tell you a couple
###386 things about Spanky.
###389 Here's my beef with the kid.
###391 I wish that he let kids know that he was
###394 really good at school.
###396 He never graduated.
###397 I could give a rat's ass about that.
###400 I don't care about that.
###401 But he was really good, he's passionate about life.
###406 And his family is all passionate about life.
###409 And that's what I'm trying to say here.
###414 That's what he does and that's who he is.
###419 And in that comes this place and these people and you.
###428 And that's passionate about life.
###431 OK, I'm getting philosophical here.
###433 Hey.
###434 KEVIN LONG: Hey, fucker.
###435 JON LONG: This is the--
###436 FEMALE SPEAKER: The build up.
###436 JON LONG: This is my friend, my bro, my friend.
###444 KEVIN LONG: Guys?
###444 JON LONG: I've never told you that, but you know what?
###448 You're like my fucking best friend.
###451 KEVIN LONG: You're my best friend.
###452 I love you, dad.
###454 JON LONG: I love you, son, and I mean it.
###458 FEMALE SPEAKER: Speech!
###460 PATRICK O'DELL: You guys, I love you guys.
###463 And I want you to know that, look at you and look at us.
###467 
###470 You son of a bitch.
###471 
###474 My resolution is no more black ass.
###478 Because I feel that when I cheated him, it's no more.
###484 MALE SPEAKER: Some more?
###486 MALE SPEAKER: A s'more?
###487 MALE SPEAKER: S'mores?
###488 Is that what he said?
###489 FEMALE SPEAKER: S'mores!
###490 JON LONG: Those are like Patrick, do I
###494 have a tale for you.
###496 PATRICK O'DELL: What's that?
###496 JON LONG: You want to do it in Spanish, English, or Irish?
###500 PATRICK O'DELL: English.
