0:0:20,538 --> 0:0:22,803
I'm writing an invitation

Exactly.

How did you know it was a woman

What kind of family

We haven't even
been together a year,

and already, no one's
paying attention to one another.

0:0:52,55 --> 0:0:54,359
The only way you can get
more ignored than this


28
0:0:54,359 --> 0:0:56,797
is by being a piercing
in Dennis Rodman's face.


29
0:0:56,797 --> 0:0:59,734
So what do you suggest
we do about this?


30
0:0:59,734 --> 0:1:1,436
We should have a get-together.

How is a party gonna make us
pay attention to each other?


32
0:1:4,872 --> 0:1:7,6
It's not a party.
It's a get-together.


33
0:1:7,6 --> 0:1:9,73
It's about people hanging out,
talking,

0:1:9,73 --> 0:1:11,707
eating,
playing cards together.

all this food,

and cleaning up

get together?


38

Why are you making it
so complicated?

Because it is.

No, it's not.
Fine.

for him.


202
0:6:35,835 --> 0:6:38,803
Oh, you mean so they can
nitpick and criticize her


203
0:6:38,803 --> 0:6:40,637
until she runs out of the place
in tears?


204
0:6:40,637 --> 0:6:44,206
Look, man, Suzanne did not
mean to make that girl cry.


205
0:6:44,206 --> 0:6:45,941
You were gonna find out
she was a dominatrix


206
0:6:45,941 --> 0:6:47,208
sooner or later.


207
0:6:47,208 --> 0:6:50,577
Yeah, and your wife
deprived me of that wonderful--


208
0:6:50,577 --> 0:6:52,245
yo! Yo.


209
0:6:52,245 --> 0:6:53,412
This is about me.


210
0:6:53,412 --> 0:6:54,613
Okay?


211
0:6:54,613 --> 0:6:56,415
Now, take a good look.


212
0:6:56,415 --> 0:6:57,582
I'm good, right?


213
0:6:57,582 --> 0:6:59,384
You good.


214
0:6:59,384 --> 0:7:0,652
Y'all don't see it, do you?


215
0:7:0,652 --> 0:7:1,819
Nope.


216
0:7:1,819 --> 0:7:3,187
Look now.
Look carefully.


217
0:7:3,187 --> 0:7:5,355
What am I supposed to see?


218
0:7:5,355 --> 0:7:6,59
Pow!
Whoa!


219
0:7:6,59 --> 0:7:8,58
Where'd you get that?


220
0:7:8,58 --> 0:7:9,92
Don't worry about it.


221
0:7:9,92 --> 0:7:11,126
But if anybody
make my date cry,


222
0:7:11,126 --> 0:7:14,62
there's more
where this came from.


223
0:7:14,62 --> 0:7:17,7
What's that?


224
0:7:17,7 --> 0:7:18,801
What's that?


225
0:7:18,801 --> 0:7:20,736
All right.


226
0:7:20,736 --> 0:7:29,477
[Mutters]


227
0:7:29,477 --> 0:7:31,246
Look, I'm having
a little get-together


228
0:7:31,246 --> 0:7:32,479
at the house this weekend.


229
0:7:32,479 --> 0:7:34,38
Bring whatever you want.


230
0:7:34,38 --> 0:7:36,348
It's over when it's over.


231
0:7:36,348 --> 0:7:41,386
I'll see you there.


232
0:7:41,386 --> 0:7:42,42
Hey.


233
0:7:42,42 --> 0:7:44,722
Hey.


234
0:7:44,722 --> 0:7:45,856
You okay?


235
0:7:45,856 --> 0:7:47,19
Yeah, I guess.


236
0:7:47,19 --> 0:7:51,395
I can't think of anybody
to invite to the get-together.


237
0:7:51,395 --> 0:7:52,73
What happened to Troy?


238
0:7:52,73 --> 0:7:53,864
He can't come.


239
0:7:53,864 --> 0:7:55,498
What about your friends
from camp?


240
0:7:55,498 --> 0:7:56,532
Still at camp.


241
0:7:56,532 --> 0:7:57,699
[Sighs]


242
0:7:57,699 --> 0:8:0,534
Well, you can invite
anybody you can think of.


243
0:8:0,534 --> 0:8:2,402
If they're cool with you,
they're cool with me.


244
0:8:2,402 --> 0:8:3,536
For real?


245
0:8:3,536 --> 0:8:4,804
For real.


246
0:8:4,804 --> 0:8:10,677
Thanks, Nick.
Slap!


247
0:8:10,677 --> 0:8:15,547
[Beeping]


248
0:8:15,547 --> 0:8:17,181
Hello?


249
0:8:17,181 --> 0:8:18,182
Hey, dad.


250
0:8:18,182 --> 0:8:21,952
It's Kevin.


251
0:8:21,952 --> 0:8:28,191
[Doorbell ringing]


252
0:8:28,191 --> 0:8:29,158
Can I help you?


253
0:8:29,158 --> 0:8:30,693
How you doing?
Staten Island Mike.


254
0:8:30,693 --> 0:8:31,86
I'm here for the get-together.


255
0:8:31,86 --> 0:8:33,193
Right.


256
0:8:33,193 --> 0:8:38,864
Come on in.


257
0:8:38,864 --> 0:8:40,565
Am I the only one here?


258
0:8:40,565 --> 0:8:42,434
Yes, you're the only one here.


259
0:8:42,434 --> 0:8:44,501
I got some
banging potato salad.


260
0:8:44,501 --> 0:8:45,502
Thank you.


261
0:8:45,502 --> 0:8:47,804
Who shows up for a party
at 9:00 A.M.?


262
0:8:47,804 --> 0:8:48,805
Party?


263
0:8:48,805 --> 0:8:50,273
I thought this was
a get-together.


264
0:8:50,273 --> 0:8:51,607
You're right.


265
0:8:51,607 --> 0:8:52,708
It's not a party.


266
0:8:52,708 --> 0:8:54,75
It's a get-together.


267
0:8:54,75 --> 0:8:55,142
Follow me.


268
0:8:55,142 --> 0:8:57,176
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.


269
0:8:57,176 --> 0:8:59,144
It ain't
that type of get-together.


270
0:8:59,144 --> 0:9:0,845
Let's go.


271
0:9:0,845 --> 0:9:2,313
Honey.


272
0:9:2,313 --> 0:9:4,648
Guess who's here.


273
0:9:4,648 --> 0:9:5,882
Nick.


274
0:9:5,882 --> 0:9:7,35
Nick.


275
0:9:7,35 --> 0:9:8,517
Hmm?


276
0:9:8,517 --> 0:9:9,485
[Moans]


277
0:9:9,485 --> 0:9:11,92
Who is that?


278
0:9:11,92 --> 0:9:14,389
This is
Staten Island Mike.


279
0:9:14,389 --> 0:9:15,891
He's here
for your get-together.


280
0:9:15,891 --> 0:9:16,992
What's up, brother?


281
0:9:16,992 --> 0:9:20,829
He brought
some bangin' potato salad.


282
0:9:20,829 --> 0:9:22,132
And that's the goods, man.


283
0:9:22,132 --> 0:9:29,33
What is wrong with you, man?


284
0:9:29,33 --> 0:9:30,2
See, honey?


285
0:9:30,2 --> 0:9:32,235
This is
what I'm talking about.


286
0:9:32,235 --> 0:9:34,404
Baby, where is
the real food?


287
0:9:34,404 --> 0:9:36,707
Uh, I got a little problem.


288
0:9:36,707 --> 0:9:38,708
See, I told people
to bring something,


289
0:9:38,708 --> 0:9:40,876
but they all
brought the same thing...


290
0:9:40,876 --> 0:9:41,877
Both: Potato salad.


291
0:9:41,877 --> 0:9:42,845
[Doorbell rings]


292
0:9:42,845 --> 0:9:43,912
Ding dong.
Hey.


293
0:9:43,912 --> 0:9:45,8
Hey.
Hey, y'all.


294
0:9:45,8 --> 0:9:46,748
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
All right?


295
0:9:46,748 --> 0:9:47,749
Here she is.


296
0:9:47,749 --> 0:9:49,584
Remember Lisa from the bank?


297
0:9:49,584 --> 0:9:51,219
Hi, it's nice to meet you.


298
0:9:51,219 --> 0:9:52,187
Nice to meet you too.


299
0:9:52,187 --> 0:9:53,488
Oh, Lisa,


300
0:9:53,488 --> 0:9:55,723
you look a little different
than I thought you would.


301
0:9:55,723 --> 0:9:58,57
Well, let me tell you.


302
0:9:58,57 --> 0:9:59,892
Almost getting killed
will change a person.


303
0:9:59,892 --> 0:10:0,893
Hey, you know what?


304
0:10:0,893 --> 0:10:2,695
Getting killed
will change you too.


305
0:10:2,695 --> 0:10:7,232
Well, the old Lisa is gone,
and the new Lisa needs a drink.


306
0:10:7,232 --> 0:10:8,901
Please tell me
you have a punch bowl.


307
0:10:8,901 --> 0:10:10,603
Yeah, it's in the kitchen.


308
0:10:10,603 --> 0:10:11,704
Is it spiked?


309
0:10:11,704 --> 0:10:12,904
It's not.


310
0:10:12,904 --> 0:10:14,572
That's okay.


311
0:10:14,572 --> 0:10:15,706
I got it.


312
0:10:15,706 --> 0:10:19,811
[Laughing]


313
0:10:19,811 --> 0:10:21,312
Ah, she's funny.


314
0:10:21,312 --> 0:10:23,58
Well, if by "funny"
you mean crazy,


315
0:10:23,58 --> 0:10:24,848
well, she's hilarious.


316
0:10:24,848 --> 0:10:27,483
She's gonna
spike my punchbowl, isn't she?


317
0:10:27,483 --> 0:10:28,95
I think so.


318
0:10:28,95 --> 0:10:31,453
Lisa!


319
0:10:31,453 --> 0:10:33,355
You look good, man.


320
0:10:33,355 --> 0:10:39,261
Don't touch me.


321
0:10:39,261 --> 0:10:40,362
Hey, Nick.


322
0:10:40,362 --> 0:10:42,196
Do you have
any Margarita mix?


323
0:10:42,196 --> 0:10:43,531
Margarita mix.


324
0:10:43,531 --> 0:10:44,565
All right.


325
0:10:44,565 --> 0:10:45,8
Where are you going?


326
0:10:45,8 --> 0:10:48,102
Um, to grab some things
from the store.


327
0:10:48,102 --> 0:10:49,737
Nick, this is
your get-together.


328
0:10:49,737 --> 0:10:50,838
You cannot leave.


329
0:10:50,838 --> 0:10:56,475
Are you two gonna fight?


330
0:10:56,475 --> 0:10:58,777
Go on.


331
0:10:58,777 --> 0:10:59,711
Look, I'll be right back.


332
0:10:59,711 --> 0:11:0,877
You don't have to do
a thing.


333
0:11:0,877 --> 0:11:1,944
Really?


334
0:11:1,944 --> 0:11:3,845
Because some guy
I've never met


335
0:11:3,845 --> 0:11:6,47
was upstairs
with some girl I've never met


336
0:11:6,47 --> 0:11:7,848
giving her
a tour of the house.


337
0:11:7,848 --> 0:11:9,717
A tour, huh?


338
0:11:9,717 --> 0:11:12,119
Ooh!


339
0:11:12,119 --> 0:11:13,987
Don't forget
my Margarita mix.


340
0:11:13,987 --> 0:11:14,988
Bring two:


341
0:11:14,988 --> 0:11:17,724
One for me
and another one for me.


342
0:11:17,724 --> 0:11:19,392
Oh!


343
0:11:19,392 --> 0:11:23,927
This the shizzle my nizzle.


344
0:11:23,927 --> 0:11:25,562
I am not your nizzle.


345
0:11:25,562 --> 0:11:27,297
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

[Excited chatter]


349
0:11:39,675 --> 0:11:43,312
This is just crazy.

0:11:43,312 --> 0:11:44,747
Lindsey.


351
0:11:44,747 --> 0:11:48,284
Does your father know how many
people you invited to the party?


352
0:11:48,284 --> 0:11:57,725
It's not a party, mom.
It's a get-together.


353
0:11:57,725 --> 0:12:0,828
Hey.


354
0:12:0,828 --> 0:12:2,296
Lisa.


355
0:12:2,296 --> 0:12:4,64
Look, girl,
you're starting to embarrass me.


356
0:12:4,64 --> 0:12:5,866
Now, will you please
sit your butt down


357
0:12:5,866 --> 0:12:6,867
and get it together?


358
0:12:6,867 --> 0:12:9,3
I like the way
you take charge.


359
0:12:9,3 --> 0:12:10,636
And that's why


360
0:12:10,636 --> 0:12:13,572
you're the President of
the United States of America.


361
0:12:13,572 --> 0:12:15,39
Go, Bama.


362
0:12:15,39 --> 0:12:16,4
Go, Bama.


363
0:12:16,4 --> 0:12:17,41
Go, Bama.


364
0:12:17,41 --> 0:12:18,309
Go, Bama.


365
0:12:18,309 --> 0:12:19,578
Go, Bama.


366
0:12:19,578 --> 0:12:22,47
Go, Bama.


367
0:12:22,47 --> 0:12:23,815
You all right, man?
Yeah, I'm all right.


368
0:12:23,815 --> 0:12:26,35
So y'all wanted her here.
What you think?


369
0:12:26,35 --> 0:12:28,852
Well, I think you're a lot
less embarrassed with her here


370
0:12:28,852 --> 0:12:30,153
than you would be out in public.


371
0:12:30,153 --> 0:12:34,824
No, I'm pretty embarrassed
here too.


372
0:12:34,824 --> 0:12:35,991
Lisa!


373
0:12:35,991 --> 0:12:41,429
Girl, put your clothes
back on.


374
0:12:41,429 --> 0:12:42,664
Pow!


375
0:12:42,664 --> 0:12:43,798
Wait for it.


376
0:12:43,798 --> 0:12:45,7
Wait for it.
[giggles]


377
0:12:45,7 --> 0:12:48,35
Is that your
rich white man's dress?


378
0:12:48,35 --> 0:12:50,237
You like?
Mm-hmm.


379
0:12:50,237 --> 0:12:51,639
And where would you be going
in that?


380
0:12:51,639 --> 0:12:53,241
What difference
does it make to you?


381
0:12:53,241 --> 0:12:54,542
A guy can't ask?


382
0:12:54,542 --> 0:12:59,112
Well, you can ask,
but it's none of your business.


383
0:12:59,112 --> 0:13:0,58
Man, look at you.


384
0:13:0,58 --> 0:13:3,716
Wherever you're going dressed
like that is where I want to be.


385
0:13:3,716 --> 0:13:4,95
[Giggles]


386
0:13:4,95 --> 0:13:7,218
If you were gonna be
where I was gonna be,


387
0:13:7,218 --> 0:13:10,42
I could guarantee
I wouldn't be there.


388
0:13:10,42 --> 0:13:12,789
[Laughs]


389
0:13:12,789 --> 0:13:14,29
That is good.


390
0:13:14,29 --> 0:13:16,458
If that's
her get-together outfit,


391
0:13:16,458 --> 0:13:18,66
I want to see her
when she goes out.


392
0:13:18,66 --> 0:13:20,362
Can I ask you something?


393
0:13:20,362 --> 0:13:21,463
Shoot.


394
0:13:21,463 --> 0:13:22,664
Who are you?


395
0:13:22,664 --> 0:13:24,899
'Cause Nick said you told him
I invited you.


396
0:13:24,899 --> 0:13:27,167
I was at your store;
I heard you talking about it,


397
0:13:27,167 --> 0:13:28,168
so I just came by.


398
0:13:28,168 --> 0:13:29,703
It's a get-together, right?


399
0:13:29,703 --> 0:13:30,837
What's her name, anyway?


400
0:13:30,837 --> 0:13:32,905
That would be Gigi.


401
0:13:32,905 --> 0:13:34,172
Is that you?


402
0:13:34,172 --> 0:13:35,84
Not anymore.


403
0:13:35,84 --> 0:13:37,407
Do you mind?


404
0:13:37,407 --> 0:13:38,608
Would it matter?


405
0:13:38,608 --> 0:13:39,909
Not really.


406
0:13:39,909 --> 0:13:41,276
Thanks.


407
0:13:41,276 --> 0:13:43,211
Lisa.
Uh, uh.


408
0:13:43,211 --> 0:13:46,314
Okay.


409
0:13:46,314 --> 0:13:49,249
When I say "get to,"
you say "gether."


410
0:13:49,249 --> 0:13:50,683
Get to...
All: Gether.


411
0:13:50,683 --> 0:13:52,417
Get to...
All: Gether.


412
0:13:52,417 --> 0:13:54,319
Nick, I told you
he shouldn't have brought her.


413
0:13:54,319 --> 0:13:56,21
Now we got to find a way
to get her out of here


414
0:13:56,21 --> 0:13:57,155
without causing a scene.


415
0:13:57,155 --> 0:13:58,923
Why don't you set
a Margarita outside?


416
0:13:58,923 --> 0:14:1,91
Lisa, you got to stop this,
all right?


417
0:14:1,91 --> 0:14:3,159
Not only are you
embarrassing me,


418
0:14:3,159 --> 0:14:5,294
but you're embarrassing
yourself.


419
0:14:5,294 --> 0:14:8,364
Now, I know you got a small case
of post-traumatic stress,


420
0:14:8,364 --> 0:14:11,132
but acting like a fool
is not the way to deal with it.


421
0:14:11,132 --> 0:14:15,936
Actually, acting like a fool
is how most people deal with it.


422
0:14:15,936 --> 0:14:17,337
Do you want to get shot?


423
0:14:17,337 --> 0:14:19,706
Oh, that will never happen,


424
0:14:19,706 --> 0:14:21,241
not if he's around.


425
0:14:21,241 --> 0:14:22,709
He's my hero.


426
0:14:22,709 --> 0:14:25,445
Yeah, but if I'd have known
you was gonna act like this,


427
0:14:25,445 --> 0:14:33,35
I'd have left you
under the desk at the bank.


428
0:14:33,35 --> 0:14:34,618
I'm sorry.


429
0:14:34,618 --> 0:14:36,553
I don't usually act
this way.


430
0:14:36,553 --> 0:14:39,55
I just don't want
to be boring anymore.


431
0:14:39,55 --> 0:14:40,423
You're not boring.


432
0:14:40,423 --> 0:14:42,124
You're a fine,
beautiful woman.


433
0:14:42,124 --> 0:14:44,326
All you got to do
is be that way.


434
0:14:44,326 --> 0:14:46,127
You don't have to act
like this.


435
0:14:46,127 --> 0:14:49,863
Oh.


436
0:14:49,863 --> 0:14:51,64
Thank you.


437
0:14:51,64 --> 0:14:54,867
That is the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.


438
0:14:54,867 --> 0:14:56,802
Excuse me.


439
0:14:56,802 --> 0:15:1,741
Everybody, can I
have your attention, please?


440
0:15:1,741 --> 0:15:4,51
When I say, "get it,"
you say "started."


441
0:15:4,51 --> 0:15:5,945
Get it...
All: Started.


442
0:15:5,945 --> 0:15:7,79
Get it...
All: Started.


443
0:15:7,79 --> 0:15:8,58
[Laughter]


444
0:15:8,58 --> 0:15:10,882
All right.
That's it.


445
0:15:10,882 --> 0:15:12,217
Get off of my chair.


446
0:15:12,217 --> 0:15:14,185
Stop eating my food.


447
0:15:14,185 --> 0:15:17,86
Quit doing freaky stuff
in my bathroom.


448
0:15:17,86 --> 0:15:20,257
Everybody get your stuff
and get out of here,


449
0:15:20,257 --> 0:15:22,759
because this party is over.


450
0:15:22,759 --> 0:15:24,16
All: It's not a party.


451
0:15:24,16 --> 0:15:27,96
It's a get-together.


452
0:15:27,96 --> 0:15:30,165
Well, now
it's a get out together.


453
0:15:30,165 --> 0:15:31,833
Right now.
Everybody.


454
0:15:31,833 --> 0:15:34,502
Buh-bye.


455
0:15:34,502 --> 0:15:35,903
Take care.


456
0:15:35,903 --> 0:15:36,904
See y'all at the next one.


457
0:15:36,904 --> 0:15:49,848
[Girls squealing excitedly]


458
0:15:49,848 --> 0:15:51,515
[Clears throat]


459
0:15:51,515 --> 0:15:53,35
You too.


460
0:15:53,35 --> 0:16:1,888
Really?


461
0:16:1,888 --> 0:16:5,124
[Laughing]


462
0:16:5,124 --> 0:16:6,259
Terrence.


463
0:16:6,259 --> 0:16:7,394
What?


464
0:16:7,394 --> 0:16:9,664
When I say, "get it,"
you say--


465
0:16:9,664 --> 0:16:10,698
slam!


466
0:16:10,698 --> 0:16:11,998
Thank you.


467
0:16:11,998 --> 0:16:14,3
Suzanne,
what is wrong with you?


468
0:16:14,3 --> 0:16:18,236
Baby, I know you want us
to spend time as a family


469
0:16:18,236 --> 0:16:20,71
and pay attention to each other,


470
0:16:20,71 --> 0:16:22,507
but all these people
in my house,


471
0:16:22,507 --> 0:16:24,275
it's too much.


472
0:16:24,275 --> 0:16:27,478
Everybody we need
is right here.


473
0:16:27,478 --> 0:16:29,313
Yeah, but where's Kevin?


474
0:16:29,313 --> 0:16:30,848
Yeah, I haven't seen him.


475
0:16:30,848 --> 0:16:32,449
I thought
he was out in the garage.


476
0:16:32,449 --> 0:16:33,784
I thought
he was in the kitchen.


477
0:16:33,784 --> 0:16:34,851
[Doorbell rings]


478
0:16:34,851 --> 0:16:36,119
Maybe you threw him out.


479
0:16:36,119 --> 0:16:40,256
Oh, goodness.


480
0:16:40,256 --> 0:16:41,924
Suzanne.


481
0:16:41,924 --> 0:16:45,16
Frank.


482
0:16:45,16 --> 0:16:53,674
Brought you
some potato salad.


483
0:16:53,674 --> 0:16:55,775
So you ain't gonna
invite me in?


484
0:16:55,775 --> 0:16:57,677
Whoa. Whoa.
Wait a minute.


485
0:16:57,677 --> 0:16:59,812
What you doing here, man?


486
0:16:59,812 --> 0:17:1,546
After breaking
my little sister's heart


487
0:17:1,546 --> 0:17:2,613
and running out on the kids,


488
0:17:2,613 --> 0:17:4,414
you got the nerve
to show your face?


489
0:17:4,414 --> 0:17:6,349
Terrence, don't.
Can I?


490
0:17:6,349 --> 0:17:7,283
Nick, stop it.


491
0:17:7,283 --> 0:17:8,351
You know what?
You a low-down--


492
0:17:8,351 --> 0:17:9,418
Gigi, come on.


493
0:17:9,418 --> 0:17:10,552
Yeah, that's right,
Robin Thicke.


494
0:17:10,552 --> 0:17:11,486
Check your girl.


495
0:17:11,486 --> 0:17:14,22
Hold it. Hold it.
Let it go.


496
0:17:14,22 --> 0:17:15,256
What are you doing here,
Frank?


497
0:17:15,256 --> 0:17:17,191
Kev said y'all
was having a get-together.


498
0:17:17,191 --> 0:17:19,593
Dad!


499
0:17:19,593 --> 0:17:21,261
How you doing, son?


500
0:17:21,261 --> 0:17:24,129
He invited me over.


501
0:17:24,129 --> 0:17:26,965
And you, Pumpkin,
what's going on?


502
0:17:26,965 --> 0:17:28,2
Hi, dad.


503
0:17:28,2 --> 0:17:29,801
Will you please
not call me Pumpkin?


504
0:17:29,801 --> 0:17:30,869
It's a baby name.


505
0:17:30,869 --> 0:17:33,104
You still
will always be my baby.


506
0:17:33,104 --> 0:17:35,106
Her and half of Seattle.


507
0:17:35,106 --> 0:17:38,809
I brought a couple of gifts.


508
0:17:38,809 --> 0:17:41,645
For you, I have badminton.


509
0:17:41,645 --> 0:17:42,713
What's badminton?


510
0:17:42,713 --> 0:17:43,814
It's kind of like tennis


511
0:17:43,814 --> 0:17:45,715
for people who really
want to play volleyball.


512
0:17:45,715 --> 0:17:49,452
And for you, Chris Brown.


513
0:17:49,452 --> 0:17:50,853
Chris Brown?


514
0:17:50,853 --> 0:17:52,387
He could transform you.


515
0:17:52,387 --> 0:17:53,522
Really?


516
0:17:53,522 --> 0:17:55,455
Do you not watch the news
at all?


517
0:17:55,455 --> 0:17:58,324
Why don't the three of you
go and catch up?


518
0:17:58,324 --> 0:17:59,893
Good idea.
That's a good idea.


519
0:17:59,893 --> 0:18:1,695
Yeah,
I can show you my room, dad.


520
0:18:1,695 --> 0:18:5,265
Hey, Frank, how you doing?


521
0:18:5,265 --> 0:18:7,868
You know, you look like
you've been watching


522
0:18:7,868 --> 0:18:10,57
a whole lot
of exercise videos.


523
0:18:10,57 --> 0:18:18,144
Shut up.


524
0:18:18,144 --> 0:18:20,513
How long you gonna
let him stay up there?


525
0:18:20,513 --> 0:18:21,814
As long as Kevin likes.


526
0:18:21,814 --> 0:18:23,147
I'm doing this for him.


527
0:18:23,147 --> 0:18:26,383
Frank better hope to God
he's never taken hostage,


528
0:18:26,383 --> 0:18:27,817
'cause he ain't gonna make it.


529
0:18:27,817 --> 0:18:29,352
What does that even mean?


530
0:18:29,352 --> 0:18:30,886
Don't worry about it,
Robin Thicke.


531
0:18:30,886 --> 0:18:33,422
Who's Robin Thicke?


532
0:18:33,422 --> 0:18:35,557
Fun, fun, fun.


533
0:18:35,557 --> 0:18:38,859
Mm, mm, mm.
That was fun, wasn't it?


534
0:18:38,859 --> 0:18:39,893
Thanks for coming, dad.


535
0:18:39,893 --> 0:18:41,528
Hey, thanks
for having me, Kev.


536
0:18:41,528 --> 0:18:43,131
Thanks, daddy.
Come here, Pumpkin.


537
0:18:43,131 --> 0:18:44,232
See you later, dad.


538
0:18:44,232 --> 0:18:45,701
All right, y'all go on.
Bye, dad.


539
0:18:45,701 --> 0:18:48,638
All right, my kids.


540
0:18:48,638 --> 0:18:50,407
Y'all have a good time?


541
0:18:50,407 --> 0:18:52,175
As a matter of fact, we did.


542
0:18:52,175 --> 0:18:55,944
In fact, I'm thinking
about a couple of things.


543
0:18:55,944 --> 0:18:57,813
Thinking about what?


544
0:18:57,813 --> 0:19:0,414
Me spending a little more time
with the kids.


545
0:19:0,414 --> 0:19:2,149
Well, next time
we have a get-together,


546
0:19:2,149 --> 0:19:3,451
I'll be sure to let you know.


547
0:19:3,451 --> 0:19:5,118
Well,
what I'm trying to say is,


548
0:19:5,118 --> 0:19:7,32
I think
that we ought to work out


549
0:19:7,32 --> 0:19:8,955
a joint situation,


550
0:19:8,955 --> 0:19:10,858
like shared custody.


551
0:19:10,858 --> 0:19:12,326
Let's be clear about this.


552
0:19:12,326 --> 0:19:13,427
You made a decision.


553
0:19:13,427 --> 0:19:15,496
All this
wasn't good enough for you.


554
0:19:15,496 --> 0:19:17,999
And don't think you're about
to start coming around here


555
0:19:17,999 --> 0:19:19,634
and playing remember the time.


556
0:19:19,634 --> 0:19:21,802
I remember
all the time with you.


557
0:19:21,802 --> 0:19:24,537
See, now, those are your kids,
and I respect that.


558
0:19:24,537 --> 0:19:26,206
But this is my family.


559
0:19:26,206 --> 0:19:27,674
And don't think
you're about to just


560
0:19:27,674 --> 0:19:29,21
start dropping in on them
like that,


561
0:19:29,21 --> 0:19:31,445
trying to flip the script
'cause you're feeling guilty.


562
0:19:31,445 --> 0:19:34,213
Come on, Nick,
speak up for yourself, man.


563
0:19:34,213 --> 0:19:36,115
What he said.


564
0:19:36,115 --> 0:19:37,45
You know,
speaking of family,


565
0:19:37,45 --> 0:19:40,719
I understand
you've been using my name,


566
0:19:40,719 --> 0:19:45,322
Nick Kingston-Persons.


567
0:19:45,322 --> 0:19:47,858
I can have you arrested
for identity theft.


568
0:19:47,858 --> 0:19:51,828
Well, since I took your wife
and I took your kids,


569
0:19:51,828 --> 0:19:54,263
I figured I might as well
take your name.


570
0:19:54,263 --> 0:19:56,464
Yeah, well,
seeing how we taking things,


571
0:19:56,464 --> 0:19:57,898
why don't you take it all?


572
0:19:57,898 --> 0:20:1,5
You know, take my bathrobe,
my flip-flops,


573
0:20:1,5 --> 0:20:3,702
my jock strap.


574
0:20:3,702 --> 0:20:5,537
I would.


575
0:20:5,537 --> 0:20:7,505
But all that's too small.


576
0:20:7,505 --> 0:20:8,573
Ooh.


577
0:20:8,573 --> 0:20:10,307
Game, set, match.


578
0:20:10,307 --> 0:20:11,708
[Giggles]


579
0:20:11,708 --> 0:20:18,98
Frank, I think it's time
for you to leave.


580
0:20:18,98 --> 0:20:21,18
Okay, fine.


581
0:20:21,18 --> 0:20:22,53
I'll leave.


582
0:20:22,53 --> 0:20:23,821
But I'll be back.


583
0:20:23,821 --> 0:20:25,989
And I'll be waiting on you.


584
0:20:25,989 --> 0:20:27,57
[Scoffs]


585
0:20:27,57 --> 0:20:28,25
Yeah, me too.


586
0:20:28,25 --> 0:20:29,561
Yeah, me three.


587
0:20:29,561 --> 0:20:30,996
Dude's got a lot of nerve.


588
0:20:30,996 --> 0:20:33,565
You handled your business.
I got to give it to you, man.


589
0:20:33,565 --> 0:20:35,232
All: Who are you?


590
0:20:35,232 --> 0:20:38,0
Staten Island Mike.


591
0:20:38,0 --> 0:20:40,269
We need to do this
again sometimes.


592
0:20:40,269 --> 0:20:45,6
