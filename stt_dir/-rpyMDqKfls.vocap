###14 The 435i is lower, stiffer, and generally sportier than
###18 the 3 Series.
###19 But the biggest news is probably the name, which to me
###22 is plain wrong.
###24 It's like renaming Coca Cola, Vegetable Bum Water.
###29 Actually, it's not quite that bad, as you know.
###30 But you get the gist.
###32 The 3 Series coupe was a motoring staple.
###35 It didn't need renaming.
###38 After several aborted attempts to record a [INAUDIBLE]
###41 camera on the roads around Lisbon, I'm resorting to
###43 voice-over.
###43 It just wasn't happening.
###45 It's a man thing.
###47 --434--
###48 Please turn left in 100 metres.
###50 I need to be rid of you.
###52 This is a curious car, because at first it seems ridiculous
###55 that a 306-horsepower BMW coupe that will smash up to 62
###59 miles an hour in 5.1 seconds, could come across as a bit
###63 uninteresting.
###65 This one is at least fitted with the optional 8-speed auto
###68 which is, as I have to keep saying, is plain brilliant.
###72 Optional electric dampers ride well in comfort, a little bit
###75 spiky in spots.
###76 The 435i is so fast and discreet, you wonder if BMW
###80 could have made it any more ordinary looking--
###82 except for those weird arrow bits on the front wings, which
###85 look like seals' ears.
###88 The problem here is a familiar one--
###89 the 435i is so accomplished, you wonder if it borders on
###92 the boring.
###94 So I wandered into the faded glory of Estoril.
###96 And couldn't really hide my disappointment at the
###98 normalness of it all.
###101 I know the M4--
###102 now that sounds completely wrong to my ears--
###104 will be the hot shoe, but a 300-horsepower, rear-drive BMW
###108 should make you tingle just a bit.
###110 Shouldn't it?
###111 The steering is quick, the car changes direction beautifully,
###115 the motor does that BMW growly thing.
###118 But it's just not that enlivening.
###120 Nor was the message from BMW.
###123 The pre-track briefing stipulated, no drifting.
###126 Talk about red rag to a bull.
###129 So here we are at Estoril.
###132 Four laps.
###134 And, curiously, in the briefing
###136 at the end, no drifting.
###140 I'm a bit like a 14-year-old being told not to smoke, when
###145 someone says, no drifting.
###146 It's a bit, red rag to a bull.
###149 So I'm going to try and resist drifting, cause it's not big,
###152 and it's not clever.
###154 But this is a rear-wheel drive BMW.
###155 And what are rear-wheel drive BMWs for, if not to kind of
###159 play with the back of the car?
###160 Isn't that the whole point?
###160 Otherwise you just buy an Audi, don't you?
###162 I don't know.
###163 We'll discuss that later on.
###165 What have we got here then?
###166 We have a strange car, because this is 10,000 pounds more
###170 than an M135i, and yet, it has less torque.
###176 So I'm not quite sure what they're trying to do in
###179 performance terms.
###181 The chassis immediately feels better balanced.
###183 Longer wheelbase, everything about it just feels a little
###187 bit more grown up.
###189 And I really like the rear axle location.
###191 The rear axle is far better located in this car than it is
###194 in the 1 Series.
###195 It deals with this torque without thinking about it.
###197 Steering--
###198 really nice and quick, actually.
###200 Very impressed by that.
###201 Brake pedal-- firm.
###204 Why am I doing this on the track?
###206 Who's going to come and do a track in their 435i?
###208 Not many people.
###210 We're just on a normal street tire.
###212 But even so, the performance of the car.
###216 A few years ago, this would have been just about bordering
###219 on supercar performance.
###221 It's incredible.
###223 Transmission--
###223 love this 8-speed ZF.
###226 I know I crap on about it, but it's just so good.
###229 Matched with this turbo-charged straight-six, it
###232 works brilliantly, really brilliantly.
###234 
###237 Remember, no drifting please, no drifting.
###240 and I mean, no drifting.
###241 [CAR ENGINE]
###245 Okay, no drifting.
###246 
###250 BMW, I mean, it's a bit like leaving plates of cake out at
###253 tea-time, and saying, don't eat it.
###255 Your cars are brilliant at going sideways, so
###258 I'm going to do it.
###260 Morally wrong not to.
###261 
###264 Really nice chassis.
###266 I get the hint of what an M3 might be like
###269 now, it's pretty exciting.
###270 Because this structure is stiff.
###272 Everything about it is high quality.
###274 
###277 Can a BMW be called a 4 Series?
###281 That's a philosophical question.
###282 That's a deeply philosophical question, isn't it?
###285 I'm not sure it can, actually.
###287 I struggle with the group four.
###290 It doesn't sound quite right to me.
###291 [CAR ENGINE]
###297 This guy has more performance than most of the people that
###299 buy it will ever need, OK?
###301 It really does.
###305 But--
###306 and there is a "but" here, as I cruise into the pit lane.
###309 The "but," for me, is that despite driving so well, and
###313 being so fast, this is quite an ordinary-feeling car.
###316 You know?
###316 It doesn't feel that special to me at all.
###319 Well over 40 grand in the UK.
###321 Cabin is quite ordinary 3 Series.
###324 The whole thing is quite ordinary.
###326 Leaves a lot of space for the M3.
###327 A lot of space for the M3.
###331 And so, underneath all that gloss and perfection, there
###334 really is a very good performance car.
###336 One that keeps BMW well ahead of its German rivals in this
###339 particular sector.
###341 And, as if to acknowledge the fact that it might need some
###343 added spice, BMW will be offering a load M Performance
###347 modifications as aftermarket parts--
###350 suspension, brakes, a locking differential, and a power kit
###353 that adds 34 horsepower, and 37 foot pounds of torque,
###356 taking it back up to kind of M135i levels of poke.
###360 The only problem is, they didn't let us drive one.
###364 Just remember--
###365 no drifting.
###366 [CAR ENGINE]
###371 [LAUGHTER]
###374 [BEEP]
###375 you.
###375 Of course we're going to do some drifting, you know?
###377 I mean, it's a BMW, isn't it?
###378
