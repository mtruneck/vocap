###23 The one-inch punch is actually
###27 a method
###29 of chinese Gung Fu of generating power.
###33 One inch punch is a catchy term made,
###35 made up by Bruce Lee which it is actually correct but really there's all kinds
###39 of short power I mean you can use a short power palm strike, you can use you
###43 know half-inch punch, or three-inch punch.
###46 Some people call it a trick, could be a trick it, could be a...
###50 a motion but it does the damage for what it is, its pretty powerful.
###57 With your wrist joint is the best way to start usually and just flicking it
###62 
###63 Giving yourself a flat target and you use bottom three knuckles here and you just
###68 pop forward
###69 Take your time, no point in rushing it.  Make sure your elbow is in your center and just
###73 slowly over time.  Just keep working on it you know like a soft pad or a pad of beans.
###78 Usually having a training partner someone hold something for you
###82 is a good judgement for how much power you're putting out.
###85 And you just...
###86 keep doing it, keep doing it until you feel like
###90 you've got a decent amount of control.  There's a certain amount of time that
###94 wrist strengthening takes place in your training too, that's a big part of it
###98 has to do with training the form.
###100 
###104 The traditional way mostly goes into the internal aspect
###109 the centering of the chi
###113 Chinese medicine
###115 have this concept of chi circulation in the body
###119 and by developing the internal power, the internal chi
###123 you develop the One Inch Punch.  One is first through the practice of
###127 breathing or chi meditation.
###129 through breathing visualization, developing
###134 power centers in certain parts of the body.
###137 That's the internal approach
###139 The external approach is more muscular and body alignment,
###143 power base,
###145 torque generation.
###147 
###157 A lot of fights starts with finger pointing and a lot of that stuff
###160 and from that finger pointing, which is the closes to someone's
###163 solar plexus, maybe your face
###166 You can generate that One Inch Punch
###169 that will actually, be your winning card.
###172 So let's say the person
###174 attack and the person kind of intercepts my punch
###179 That's where one inch punch comes in
###180 Without pulling back that's from a combative stand point.
###193 If you hit someone with the one inch punch
###196 maybe on the surface you break their ribs.
###199 Internally, you might shock their internal system.
###203 You can rupture someone's spleen,
###205 you can damage their liver,
###207 you can bruise someone's heart.
###209 Something wrong with one of your vertebrae and someone strikes you really hard the power is going to
###212 try and find a easy way out and it'll go through that injury point.
###216 In extreme cases guys have been known to strike someone in the front and then
###219 it injures their back.
###220 You're hitting his vulnerable point that is also the key too
###223 but obviously if you hit...
###225 the weakest man in the strongest point you're not going to do nay damage because he's
###229 got muscles protection.
###234 
###237 
###239 
###245 In the Chinese movies
###247 the One Inch Punch has always been showcased very well.
###255 However, Kill Bill Vol. 2 the way that it was portrayed
###261 was okay but it just visually it was not pleasing.
###266 Kill Bill the way that the one inch punch was portrayed was...
###270 was, you know, taking your skin off your knuckles and this is how it is
###275 But
###276 it's not about that, it is about the body mass
###279 that moves it is not the callous on your knuckles that does the damage.
###283 
###291 I would continue to teach the one inch punch as part of my curriculum
###296 if the student get that far.
###298 If you learn how to
###300 apply short...
###302 shortest distances with the most powerful impact you can generate there's a pleasure
###307 because there's a huge discovery about
###309 about one-inch movement.  If you look at it in that context its got invaluable lessons.
###316 But if you look at it as a one-trick pony...
###318 that's it, that's the end of that show, you know?
###321 I think there's been a slight dip
###323 in martial arts in general.  If you think 150, 200 years ago
###327 people were training this system
###330 because that's all they had.
###331 That was their livelihood, they trained a lot harder than they do today and people tend to be a little lazier.
###336 Maybe that's why there's not that much interests in martial arts because the kids
###339 would just play video games all night long why come and train and sweat
###343 and be painful right?
###345 You got to think, we've been doing basically the same stuff until about 100 years ago
###349 until industrial revolution, that changed everything, people are sitting in front of computers
###355 And we haven't had time to catch up with that yet
###358 It's a radical change.  So I think the importance of getting back in touch with your body
###362 ... is very high and continue to become up more on the priority list for
###366 a lot of people so I expect martial arts to take actually you know
###370 I think there are taking upswing back up.
###374 Because there are systems out there that are almost being lost
###377 and people don't want her to go away.
###380 I think they're going to get better.
###382 The consequence of one inch punch that happened in Long Beach, for me at least..it's...
###386 it's amazing and I think...
###387 it keeps opening doors
###390 and I think that would be the future of one inch movement or One Inch Punch.
