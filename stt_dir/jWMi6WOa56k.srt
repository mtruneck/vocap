2
0:0:11,96 --> 0:0:13,9
DAVID CHOE: I'd spent the early
part of my childhood


3
0:0:13,9 --> 0:0:14,91
traveling a lot.


4
0:0:14,91 --> 0:0:17,67
Train hopping, hitch hiking,
doing all these things.


5
0:0:17,67 --> 0:0:21,8
The sense of adventure, the
sense of wonder, I don't know.


6
0:0:21,8 --> 0:0:24,35
I guess it's real childish,
but I wanted to see and go


7
0:0:24,35 --> 0:0:26,14
places where no one's
been before.


8
0:0:26,14 --> 0:0:28,135
I've been reading about this
dinosaur in "National


9
0:0:28,135 --> 0:0:29,795
Geographic" and online.


10
0:0:29,795 --> 0:0:31,73
And I didn't give a shit.


11
0:0:31,73 --> 0:0:34,715
I just wanted to go to this
crazy place and see what I can


12
0:0:34,715 --> 0:0:35,35
find, you know?


13
0:0:35,35 --> 0:0:37,22
The Congo is the heart
of darkness.


14
0:0:37,22 --> 0:0:39,77
There's an area of thick, dense,
untouched rainforest


15
0:0:39,77 --> 0:0:40,73
about the size of Florida.


16
0:0:40,73 --> 0:0:44,4
It's the only area that survived
the last ice age, and


17
0:0:44,4 --> 0:0:45,81
it's the lastly place on Earth
believed to have living,


18
0:0:45,81 --> 0:0:46,84
breathing dinosaurs .


19
0:0:46,84 --> 0:0:48,59
The one the locals talk
about the most is


20
0:0:48,59 --> 0:0:49,78
[FOREIGN LANGUAGE].


21
0:0:49,78 --> 0:0:51,22
In Pygmy language,
it means one who


22
0:0:51,22 --> 0:0:52,68
stops the flow of rivers.


23
0:0:52,68 --> 0:0:53,58
And it's fucking huge.


24
0:0:53,58 --> 0:0:56,19
It's supposed to be several
times bigger than an elephant.


25
0:0:56,19 --> 0:0:58,985
Scientific expeditions come out
every couple of years from


26
0:0:58,985 --> 0:0:59,79
all over the world.


27
0:0:59,79 --> 0:1:3,9
The British army saw glimpses
of it. "National Geographic"


28
0:1:3,9 --> 0:1:4,18
found something.


29
0:1:4,18 --> 0:1:7,575
The consensus is that it lives
deep in the rainforest near a


30
0:1:7,575 --> 0:1:10,8
lake called Lake Tele, so
that's where we went.


31
0:1:10,8 --> 0:1:11,55
And it was a hell of a ride.


32
0:1:11,55 --> 0:1:28,7



33
0:1:28,7 --> 0:1:31,89
We're in Brazzaville,
Congo today.


34
0:1:31,89 --> 0:1:33,39
I haven't been here
for 10 years.


35
0:1:33,39 --> 0:1:39,9
I've been with my group, Roch
and Stephane for three days


36
0:1:39,9 --> 0:1:41,47
now, and there's a growing
dissent within our group.


37
0:1:41,47 --> 0:1:43,7
Other people in the group want
to, like, pursue other


38
0:1:43,7 --> 0:1:47,17
stories, like, I guess albinos
are treated as gods out here.


39
0:1:47,17 --> 0:1:49,72
Another guy in our group is
obsessed with trying to get


40
0:1:49,72 --> 0:1:50,45
Pygmy porn.


41
0:1:50,45 --> 0:1:51,62
This is not what we
came here for.


42
0:1:51,62 --> 0:1:53,12
We came here for the
fucking dinosaur.


43
0:1:53,12 --> 0:1:54,2
We've talked to experts.


44
0:1:54,2 --> 0:1:55,27
We've talked to scientists.


45
0:1:55,27 --> 0:1:58,33
We've talked to local sorcerers,
and everyone's seen


46
0:1:58,33 --> 0:1:59,58
this fucking thing.


47
0:1:59,58 --> 0:2:4,8



48
0:2:4,8 --> 0:2:6,8
JOSEPH HARVEY: What I know is
that before we came, first in


49
0:2:6,8 --> 0:2:11,37
1992, I grew up with family
friends who were


50
0:2:11,37 --> 0:2:12,53
missionaries here.


51
0:2:12,53 --> 0:2:15,65
Gene Thomas and his wife, Sandy,
who was a nurse, they


52
0:2:15,65 --> 0:2:19,13
were going through this area
where the river became a


53
0:2:19,13 --> 0:2:20,35
little bit wider.


54
0:2:20,35 --> 0:2:22,61
It was almost like a
pond, or a lake.


55
0:2:22,61 --> 0:2:26,23
And he saw this huge thing
raise up out of


56
0:2:26,23 --> 0:2:31,59
the water, and he--


57
0:2:31,59 --> 0:2:32,94
it sounds so dumb,
because this is


58
0:2:32,94 --> 0:2:34,6
what happens to everybody.


59
0:2:34,6 --> 0:2:37,69
He went to get his camera, and
he couldn't get it in time,


60
0:2:37,69 --> 0:2:38,94
and it submerged.


61
0:2:38,94 --> 0:2:49,56



62
0:2:49,56 --> 0:2:52,72
MARK BIEDLINGMAIER: I ask you
just to be very open mind in


63
0:2:52,72 --> 0:2:53,6
your travels.


64
0:2:53,6 --> 0:2:54,93
It isn't the United States.


65
0:2:54,93 --> 0:2:56,106
It's not New York.


66
0:2:56,106 --> 0:2:58,38
It isn't Washington, DC.


67
0:2:58,38 --> 0:3:0,14
Infrastructure is very
challenging.


68
0:3:0,14 --> 0:3:0,766
DAVID CHOE: Right.


69
0:3:0,766 --> 0:3:2,22
MARK BIEDLINGMAIER: I don't
know if they told you, but


70
0:3:2,22 --> 0:3:4,17
where you're going has
very, very limited


71
0:3:4,17 --> 0:3:5,95
electricity, water.


72
0:3:5,95 --> 0:3:7,44
DAVID CHOE: Has basically
nothing.


73
0:3:7,44 --> 0:3:7,77
MARK BIEDLINGMAIER: Exactly.


74
0:3:7,77 --> 0:3:11,5
DAVID CHOE: And every animal
and poisonous insect, and


75
0:3:11,5 --> 0:3:12,55
every disease we can imagine.


76
0:3:12,55 --> 0:3:14,73
MARK BIEDLINGMAIER: So consider
yourself sort of on


77
0:3:14,73 --> 0:3:17,43
the wilderness, and on the
frontier of Africa.


78
0:3:17,43 --> 0:3:21,62
But I wholeheartedly support
your venture here, and I wish


79
0:3:21,62 --> 0:3:22,66
you the best of success.


80
0:3:22,66 --> 0:3:23,8
DAVID CHOE: Thank you.


81
0:3:23,8 --> 0:3:23,922
MARK BIEDLINGMAIER: Thank
you very much.


82
0:3:23,922 --> 0:3:24,343
DAVID CHOE: Nice meeting you.


83
0:3:24,343 --> 0:3:25,61
MARK BIEDLINGMAIER: Super.


84
0:3:25,61 --> 0:3:28,38
DAVID CHOE: We've got our team
together, our Pygmy force to


85
0:3:28,38 --> 0:3:31,39
take us into the jungle.


86
0:3:31,39 --> 0:3:32,79
We've got our guide here.


87
0:3:32,79 --> 0:3:36,42
He's got a nice Photoshop
shirt of the


88
0:3:36,42 --> 0:3:38,57
dinosaur with the president.


89
0:3:38,57 --> 0:3:42,15
He's sort of like the Charles
Grodin, Philip Seymour Hoffman


90
0:3:42,15 --> 0:3:43,75
guy of the group.


91
0:3:43,75 --> 0:3:48,125
Over here we have a Ben
Kingsley, sexy beast guy of


92
0:3:48,125 --> 0:3:51,32
the group, and then over here
we have the Richard Grieco,


93
0:3:51,32 --> 0:3:54,37
Terrence Howard, Benicio Del
Toro guy of the group.


94
0:3:54,37 --> 0:3:57,1
And this is our force to
go into the jungle.


95
0:3:57,1 --> 0:4:8,4



96
0:4:8,4 --> 0:4:10,3
We were wandering in the
jungle for a while.


97
0:4:10,3 --> 0:4:13,38
It was dark and light,
and disorientating.


98
0:4:13,38 --> 0:4:15,11
We got lost a couple
times, and even


99
0:4:15,11 --> 0:4:16,36
with the Pygmy guides.


100
0:4:16,36 --> 0:4:22,4



101
0:4:22,4 --> 0:4:23,496
We would have been dead
without them.


102
0:4:23,496 --> 0:4:25,21
Like, there were some areas
that we can't even get


103
0:4:25,21 --> 0:4:28,13
through, because we're so tall,
and they're the only


104
0:4:28,13 --> 0:4:30,74
ones-- them and children are the
only ones, midgets are the


105
0:4:30,74 --> 0:4:32,368
only ones that could
get through there.


106
0:4:32,368 --> 0:4:55,774



107
0:4:55,774 --> 0:4:59,1
My team looks like they're
about to die.


108
0:4:59,1 --> 0:5:1,88
We're sweating like dogs.


109
0:5:1,88 --> 0:5:4,405
I've noticed the Pygmies,
they don't sweat


110
0:5:4,405 --> 0:5:5,96
and they don't fart.


111
0:5:5,96 --> 0:5:7,19
I think they don't
fart because they


112
0:5:7,19 --> 0:5:8,44
don't eat any food.


113
0:5:8,44 --> 0:5:15,31



114
0:5:15,31 --> 0:5:18,21
So once we got to the village,
the chief and his henchmen,


115
0:5:18,21 --> 0:5:20,84
they kept asking us what
we wanted to do


116
0:5:20,84 --> 0:5:22,4
while we were there.


117
0:5:22,4 --> 0:5:23,42
Did we want to go to
the waterfalls?


118
0:5:23,42 --> 0:5:25,63
Did we want to go shoot pigs?


119
0:5:25,63 --> 0:5:27,52
We just said we wanted
to see the dinosaur.


120
0:5:27,52 --> 0:5:29,73
And then they kept saying, do
you want to see the dinosaur?


121
0:5:29,73 --> 0:5:31,39
Do you want to see
this dinosaur?


122
0:5:31,39 --> 0:5:33,13
Yes, we want to see
the dinosaur.


123
0:5:33,13 --> 0:5:34,42
Do you really want to
see this dinosaur?


124
0:5:34,42 --> 0:5:36,43
Yeah, we want to see
this dinosaur.


125
0:5:36,43 --> 0:5:41,44
So we had to do this ritual, and
this ritual involved lots


126
0:5:41,44 --> 0:5:42,69
and lots of alcohol.


127
0:5:42,69 --> 0:5:47,46



128
0:5:47,46 --> 0:5:49,74
DAVID CHOE: So they pour
us this clear liquid.


129
0:5:49,74 --> 0:5:52,34
It tastes like gasoline, and
I guess it's made from


130
0:5:52,34 --> 0:5:56,1
[INAUDIBLE] husks, and I
don't know what else.


131
0:5:56,1 --> 0:5:59,37
Tastes like fucking acid.


132
0:5:59,37 --> 0:6:5,84



133
0:6:5,84 --> 0:6:8,57
It put me on my ass
right away.


134
0:6:8,57 --> 0:6:10,547
I feel really crazy
right now, huh?


135
0:6:10,547 --> 0:6:13,29



136
0:6:13,29 --> 0:6:15,45
During all this, looking over
at Ben, he was doing this


137
0:6:15,45 --> 0:6:17,955
weird thing with branches, and
I was like, fuck, man.


138
0:6:17,955 --> 0:6:20,0
Is he like, reading
my mind right now?


139
0:6:20,0 --> 0:6:21,9
Does he know what a fucking
scumbag I am?


140
0:6:21,9 --> 0:6:24,705
He was giving me this weird
look, like he knew me.


141
0:6:24,705 --> 0:6:30,81



142
0:6:30,81 --> 0:6:32,6
That's a skinny dog.


143
0:6:32,6 --> 0:6:34,626



144
0:6:34,626 --> 0:6:46,72
[DRUM MUSIC]


145
0:6:46,72 --> 0:6:48,69
I don't know what was
in that stuff.


146
0:6:48,69 --> 0:6:50,17
They did not stop.


147
0:6:50,17 --> 0:6:53,375
Not to take a break, not to eat,
and they just keep going,


148
0:6:53,375 --> 0:6:54,53
and they just keep going.


149
0:6:54,53 --> 0:6:56,68
And then, like, some kind
of dream or something.


150
0:6:56,68 --> 0:6:59,31
This thing just came out, and
the people just screamed.


151
0:6:59,31 --> 0:7:1,35
And it was, you know, obviously
it was a dude


152
0:7:1,35 --> 0:7:3,34
dressed up like something.


153
0:7:3,34 --> 0:7:6,16
He had all these leaves, and,
you know, they were either


154
0:7:6,16 --> 0:7:8,93
saying he's an evil spirit,
or it's the dinosaur.


155
0:7:8,93 --> 0:7:10,943
And I'm like, oh, I guess
that's the dinosaur.


156
0:7:10,943 --> 0:7:13,74
And as fucked up as I
was, you know, I was


157
0:7:13,74 --> 0:7:14,9
believing it at the time.


158
0:7:14,9 --> 0:7:16,665
It felt like there was
a hole in my stomach.


159
0:7:16,665 --> 0:7:18,1
I kept staring at my feet.


160
0:7:18,1 --> 0:7:20,42
I thought my face was eating
at my own face.


161
0:7:20,42 --> 0:7:22,1
And I thought of eating
my own feet.


162
0:7:22,1 --> 0:7:23,53
I thought I was fucked,
and I knew I was


163
0:7:23,53 --> 0:7:25,1
fucked while I was fucked.


164
0:7:25,1 --> 0:7:26,76
Laying there, going, shit.


165
0:7:26,76 --> 0:7:28,7
This is going to
be really bad.


166

0:7:40,88 --> 0:7:44,704
[FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


168
0:7:44,704 --> 0:7:47,14
DAVID CHOE: I didn't come all
this way to see a guy dance


169
0:7:47,14 --> 0:7:50,28
around in a dinosaur costume and
participate in fucked up


170
0:7:50,28 --> 0:7:54,13
rituals for the chance of maybe
catching a blurry shot


171
0:7:54,13 --> 0:7:56,1
of a fuzzy dinosaur head.


172
0:7:56,1 --> 0:7:58,47
We didn't even get close to the
beginning point of where


173
0:7:58,47 --> 0:7:59,72
the dinosaur was.


174
0:7:59,72 --> 0:8:19,583



175
0:8:19,583 --> 0:8:22,37
I think we're in Lake Tele,
but I don't know.


176
0:8:22,37 --> 0:8:28,95
It's been so long since I've
eaten anything, or showered,


177
0:8:28,95 --> 0:8:32,9
or anyone's spoken any
word of English.


178
0:8:32,9 --> 0:8:34,2
You have to really be careful
when you're in the jungle.


179
0:8:34,2 --> 0:8:37,36
You have to always, like, cloud
your thoughts, because


180
0:8:37,36 --> 0:8:39,78
you never know where there's
going to be a sorcerer, "Harry


181
0:8:39,78 --> 0:8:43,27
Potter" type Pygmy ready to
psionically mind fuck you.


182
0:8:43,27 --> 0:8:46,32
So I don't know.


183
0:8:46,32 --> 0:8:46,64
Who knows?


184
0:8:46,64 --> 0:8:48,19
We might have come back.


185
0:8:48,19 --> 0:8:49,269
We'll see.
