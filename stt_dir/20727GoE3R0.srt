1
0:0:7,1 --> 0:0:9,889
This will show how to make the crochet shell
For this demonstration, I will be using a larger size crochet hook


2
0:0:9,889 --> 0:0:11,519
4 ply yarn


3
0:0:11,519 --> 0:0:15,969
we will start by attaching a slip knot to the crochet hook


4
0:0:15,969 --> 0:0:19,989
take the loose end, wrap it over the main strand, take your loop


5
0:0:19,989 --> 0:0:22,14
wrap it over the main strand


6
0:0:22,14 --> 0:0:26,289
put your hook below the center strand, back up the opposite side


7
0:0:26,289 --> 0:0:43,46
this creates the slip knot


8
0:0:43,46 --> 0:0:44,68
the multiple is six, we will be working chains in increments of six


9
0:0:44,68 --> 0:0:56,15
that's the first set


10
0:0:56,15 --> 0:0:57,31
one...two...three...four...five....six


11
0:0:57,31 --> 0:1:19,22
that's the second set


12
0:1:19,22 --> 0:1:23,7
I will be working, two extra chains


13
0:1:23,7 --> 0:1:25,44
I can get it to work with with one or two


14
0:1:25,44 --> 0:1:33,159
some times the amount, the plus amount does not  matter, the two extra chains will be the plus amount


15
0:1:33,159 --> 0:1:35,3
I'm going to work the first


16
0:1:35,3 --> 0:1:40,34
single crochet


17
0:1:40,34 --> 0:1:44,79
now i'm skipping one, two chains, in the third chain


18
0:1:44,79 --> 0:1:49,0
I am putting my hook right below the chain


19
0:1:49,0 --> 0:1:51,78
below these two loops


20
0:1:51,78 --> 0:1:54,51
and i'm working five


21
0:1:54,51 --> 0:2:0,65
double crochet


22
0:2:0,65 --> 0:2:4,1
putting my hook right through the chain
like that


23
0:2:4,1 --> 0:2:7,619
working the second


24
0:2:7,619 --> 0:2:12,299
there will be five double crochet in each shell


25

26
0:2:31,769 --> 0:2:35,249

28
0:2:39,449 --> 0:2:52,159
