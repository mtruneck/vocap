0:0:0,32 --> 0:0:16,539
This week on The J-Turn, were coming to you
from the coolest garage on the planet.


2
0:0:16,539 --> 0:0:33,6
If youre truly an automotive enthusiast, then
you have probably heard of this place.


3
0:0:33,6 --> 0:0:38,57
Leslie, thank you for having us today.


4
0:0:38,57 --> 0:0:39,92
What a pleasure.


5
0:0:39,92 --> 0:0:40,37
Likewise.


6
0:0:40,37 --> 0:0:43,469
Tell us a little bit about the Petersen Museum.
How did it begin?


7
0:0:43,469 --> 0:0:48,18
The Petersen Museum was the brainchild of
Margie and Robert E. Petersen. Mr. Petersen


8
0:0:48,18 --> 0:0:51,46
founded
Hot Rod Magazine and Motor Trend magazine,


9
0:0:51,46 --> 0:0:56,75
and a couple of dozen other enthusiast magazines.
And he wanted there to be a special place


10
0:0:56,75 --> 0:0:59,32
in Los Angeles where we could celebrate our
car culture,


11
0:0:59,32 --> 0:1:2,359
and as it happens, a car culture that he helped
to create.


12
0:1:2,359 --> 0:1:4,25
And how many cars do you have in your collection?


13
0:1:4,25 --> 0:1:6,54
We have over 400 cars in the collection.


14
0:1:6,54 --> 0:1:10,96
What Im really excited to see is the vault.
Will you take me there?


15
0:1:10,96 --> 0:1:26,14
Id love to. Lets go.


16
0:1:26,14 --> 0:1:30,42
So were finally here in the vault. Im really
excited to be here. Tell me a little bit about


17
0:1:30,42 --> 0:1:31,77
this collection.


18
0:1:31,77 --> 0:1:36,22
Well, the collection was acquired by Margie
and Robert E. Petersen during their lifetime


19
0:1:36,22 --> 0:1:39,299
and by people
who have donated cars to the Petersen Automotive


20
0:1:39,299 --> 0:1:44,469
Museum Foundation. And since we only have
room for about 150 upstairs, we keep a good


21
0:1:44,469 --> 0:1:47,2
couple of hundred down here in reserve for
future


22
0:1:47,2 --> 0:1:51,509
exhibits and to take to car shows throughout
the country. Its living, breathing workspace


23
0:1:51,509 --> 0:1:54,259
so its very
unusual for the vault to look exactly the


24
0:1:54,259 --> 0:1:55,659
same two days in a row.


25
0:1:55,659 --> 0:1:57,77
Alright, I want to see some of your favorite
cars.


26
0:1:57,77 --> 0:2:0,49
Id love to show them to you.


27
0:2:0,49 --> 0:2:7,71
One of my favorites in the collection has
to be this 1939 Bugatti Type 57C. Straight


28
0:2:7,71 --> 0:2:12,11
8, twin cam,
supercharged. But thats not where it ends.


29
0:2:12,11 --> 0:2:14,59
This car was actually a gift from the French
government


30
0:2:14,59 --> 0:2:19,5
to the Shah of Iran in 1939 when he got married.


31
0:2:19,5 --> 0:2:23,73
But its so beautiful, its so exquisite. Its
really a piece of rolling sculpture. I mean,


32
0:2:23,73 --> 0:2:27,8
you cant help but
notice the concealed wheels, the spats over


33
0:2:27,8 --> 0:2:30,97
the front and the rear, these really clever
air vents on the


34
0:2:30,97 --> 0:2:37,66
side that open to let the flow of air come
into the passenger compartment. You have hidden


35
0:2:37,66 --> 0:2:41,17
door
handles that open in a very unique way. And


36
0:2:41,17 --> 0:2:44,0
once youre inside, you have a hand crank under
the


37
0:2:44,0 --> 0:2:49,28
dashboard that you can raise or lower the
windshield. Its really a very practical car.


38
0:2:49,28 --> 0:2:54,73
Its a lovely car. Its built during the height
of the art deco era and has to be one of the


39
0:2:54,73 --> 0:2:58,9
most exciting
combinations of chassis and coachwork and


40
0:2:58,9 --> 0:3:3,73
history of any car thats been built.


41
0:3:3,73 --> 0:3:10,15
This is our 1913 Mercer, a century-old car.
And in its day, this car was as sexy and as


42
0:3:10,15 --> 0:3:15,48
exotic and as rare
as any Lamborghini and Ferrari is today. This,


43
0:3:15,48 --> 0:3:18,42
in fact, was a supercar of its era, an era
where there


44
0:3:18,42 --> 0:3:23,5
were still dirt roads and a lot of horses
on the road to kind of try to maneuver around.


45
0:3:23,5 --> 0:3:25,9
You were really
something if you could have one of these cars


46
0:3:25,9 --> 0:3:29,9
and handle it properly. But this car required
about a six


47
0:3:29,9 --> 0:3:33,26
to eight step starting procedure, depending
on whether or not it was recently running.


48
0:3:33,26 --> 0:3:35,76
You have to
set little controls and you have to go under


49
0:3:35,76 --> 0:3:38,23
the hood and you have to prime the engine.
But this was


50
0:3:38,23 --> 0:3:43,24
the kind of authentic motoring experience
that you wouldve had one-hundred years ago.


51
0:3:43,24 --> 0:3:47,57
Alright, well I cant wait any longer. I really
want to see the Ferrari that Enzo gave to


52
0:3:47,57 --> 0:3:48,31
Henry Ford.


53
0:3:48,31 --> 0:3:51,51
We can go right now. I know where it is.


54
0:3:51,51 --> 0:4:0,67
Here it is! Ive been waiting for this.


55
0:4:0,67 --> 0:4:8,94
Jessi, you picked a really good car to like.
This is a 1952 Ferrari 212 225 Spyder. This


56
0:4:8,94 --> 0:4:11,3
car has a really
special history because its the only one of


57
0:4:11,3 --> 0:4:15,42
its kind ever made and it was given by Enzo
Ferrari to Henry


58
0:4:15,42 --> 0:4:19,95
Ford II. There was a time when ford and Ferrari
were thinking about getting together. It never


59
0:4:19,95 --> 0:4:22,63
happened, but there was some thought there.


60
0:4:22,63 --> 0:4:27,63
And we come back here and you notice this
is strictly a fair-weather car. Theres absolutely


61
0:4:27,63 --> 0:4:30,4
no
provision for weather protection. And because


62
0:4:30,4 --> 0:4:32,76
theres no side windows, you dont need outside
door


63
0:4:32,76 --> 0:4:37,1
handles because you can just reach inside
and open the door. This car has never been


64
0:4:37,1 --> 0:4:41,48
restored. It
only has about 12,000 miles on it. And its


65
0:4:41,48 --> 0:4:44,6
the original paint. The engine has never been
outside or


66
0:4:44,6 --> 0:4:49,9
apart. Its just a really extraordinary car,
a true survivor.


67
0:4:49,9 --> 0:4:54,87
The car that really stayed with me throughout
the day was that massive Rolls Royce. Ive


68
0:4:54,87 --> 0:4:57,43
never seen, I
mean it doesnt even look like a Rolls Royce,


69
0:4:57,43 --> 0:5:0,87
Ive never seen anything like it. From the
circular doors to


70
0:5:0,87 --> 0:5:9,73
the fan-shaped opening windows, its really
just an incredible and monstrous creature.


71
0:5:9,73 --> 0:5:15,4
Theres the Toyota 2000GT, Japans first supercar.
It looks like a Datsun, but it was actually


72
0:5:15,4 --> 0:5:17,78
built three
years prior to Datsun being introduced. It


73
0:5:17,78 --> 0:5:20,57
was built by Yamaha for Toyota and everything
on it is


74
0:5:20,57 --> 0:5:26,3
entirely original. The paint, the interior,
theyve never been redone or restored.


75
0:5:26,3 --> 0:5:33,6
Steve McQueens Jaguar XKSS is the sexiest
Jaguar Ive ever seen. And he mustve agreed


76
0:5:33,6 --> 0:5:38,79
because he
liked it so much he bought it twice.


77
0:5:38,79 --> 0:5:42,56
Its absolutely obvious from looking around
the vault that Mr. Petersen loved his hot


78
0:5:42,56 --> 0:5:46,16
rods. He
founded Hot Rod Magazine in 1948 and it seems


79
0:5:46,16 --> 0:5:48,57
his love grew throughout his life. Theres
so many


80
0:5:48,57 --> 0:5:52,57
different combinations and ways that you can
build them. Some of them have crazy grilles,


81
0:5:52,57 --> 0:5:55,74
ridiculous
detailing, upholstery on the running boards.


82
0:5:55,74 --> 0:5:59,4
No two are alike.


83
0:5:59,4 --> 0:6:2,7
The collection they have in the vault, its
almost overwhelming, its almost automotive


84
0:6:2,7 --> 0:6:7,56
overload. Just a
ton of iconic cars surrounded by equally iconic


85
0:6:7,56 --> 0:6:12,2
cars. You could spend days there.


86
0:6:12,2 --> 0:6:16,5
I really love how all the vehicles down here
are, you know Im not kept away from them by


87
0:6:16,5 --> 0:6:19,94
ropes and
there arent any, theres no historical context


88
0:6:19,94 --> 0:6:21,0
surrounding them.


89
0:6:21,0 --> 0:6:25,81
Youre right and thats not always a bad thing
to have cars that are really stripped from


90
0:6:25,81 --> 0:6:29,12
their context.
And thats the idea behind the vault. People


91
0:6:29,12 --> 0:6:33,3
can come down here and see a sea of cars and
they can


92
0:6:33,3 --> 0:6:38,68
get pretty close to them. They can see how
the cars differ, how much theyre alike. They


93
0:6:38,68 --> 0:6:41,97
can
compare a 39 Bugatti to a 39 Mercury if they


94
0:6:41,97 --> 0:6:46,63
want to. They can see how the differences
of French


95
0:6:46,63 --> 0:6:53,53
coach-building compare with American coach-building
and get a whole new perspective on


96
0:6:53,53 --> 0:6:54,169
automobiles.


97
0:6:54,169 --> 0:6:57,59
Now I know that you guys opened the vault
to the public for the very first time over


98
0:6:57,59 --> 0:7:1,15
the 2012 holiday
season and that it was so popular that youve


99
0:7:1,15 --> 0:7:4,6
extended the hours. How long does the public
have to


100
0:7:4,6 --> 0:7:5,82
get down here and see the vault?


101
0:7:5,82 --> 0:7:11,24
Well, we have indeed done that. Im not sure.
The public can come down here indefinitely


102
0:7:11,24 --> 0:7:14,41
but Im
not even sure how long indefinitely is gonna


103
0:7:14,41 --> 0:7:18,11
be. As long as theres an interest then well
want to


104
0:7:18,11 --> 0:7:19,63
make it available to people.


105
0:7:19,63 --> 0:9:19,63
So, you heard him. Nobody knows how long the
vault doors will stay open and times a wasting!
