###20 HARRY CHEADLE: Everyone I know reveres Louis C.K. even though
###23 he's a fat, bald, middle-aged dude who talks
###25 about his dick on stage.
###27 That's the great thing about stand-up comedy.
###29 All that matters is that you make people laugh.
###31 And like a lot of people who think they're funny, I've
###34 always believed that maybe I could do stand up, too, if I
###36 only took a shot at it.
###39 That was my first mistake.
###40 
###44 My name is Harry, and I've been a loser
###45 for most of my life.
###46 I thought I was done with my awkward phase when Vice hired
###49 me to write about politics, culture, and other important
###51 world affairs which should make me cool, but it doesn't.
###55 I'm still just a weird kid who creeps people out.
###57 This is "All Around Losing" with Harry Cheadle.
###59 
###62 So I'm out here in front of the Sidewalk Cafe where they
###64 have an open mic every night.
###67 I am incredibly nervous right now.
###69 I've written my set list on my hand.
###71 As you can see, it goes from porn to sex-ed to
###74 Obama at the end.
###75 And I don't think this is going to go well, but I'm also
###78 confident this is going to go well because I'm just a
###80 massive contradiction.
###82 But here I go.
###84 -Make some noise for Harry as he comes to stage.
###86 
###89 HARRY CHEADLE: You guys are really attractive out there.
###90 The terrifying part of doing stand-up is when you get to
###93 the punch lines.
###94 Are people going to laugh?
###96 Are they going to boo?
###97 Are they going to know I have no business being on stage?
###99 There almost has to be something wrong with you to
###101 expose yourself to a situation like that.
###103 But surprisingly, the crowd at the Sidewalk laughed at all
###106 the right times.
###106 [LAUGHTER]
###107 HARRY CHEADLE: Sex is gross.
###108 Sex is just the two weirdest parts of your body just
###110 colliding over and over.
###112 [LAUGHTER]
###112 HARRY CHEADLE: If I went back in time and talked to my
###115 11-year-old self about the sex I was having, he'd be like,
###118 that's gross.
###118 And he'd be right, and I think I'd probably go to jail for
###121 talking to an 11-year-old about sex anyway.
###123 [LAUGHTER]
###124 Even the guy who heckled me was polite.
###127 I will, and I have a whole bunch of jokes about sex.
###130 
###133 I don't know.
###135 I guess I'm going to keep going on with the jokes I have
###137 in my head, if you don't mind.
###139 
###143 Oh yeah, let me talk more about sex for a second.
###147 Maybe I was just good at this?
###148 Thanks, you guys have been great.
###149 [APPLAUSE]
###153 -Harry.
###153 It's his first time, everybody.
###155 
###159 HARRY CHEADLE: I didn't do too badly my first time on stage
###161 which was surprising because I blacked out and have no memory
###164 of the experience whatsoever.
###165 When I came to, it was already time for my second show at Cha
###169 Cha's Comedy Club.
###170 On my way inside, I ran into Cha Cha himself, a spherical,
###174 Hawaiian-shirted, comedy guru who's been in the
###176 business for decades.
###178 CHA CHA: How long you've been doing this?
###180 HARRY CHEADLE: I've been doing like a week, honestly.
###182 CHA CHA: A week, right?
###183 
###215 -Please put your hands together and welcome to the
###217 stage Harry Cheadle.
###218 
###221 HARRY CHEADLE: When I have sex it's like I'm a blind man in a
###224 bouncy castle trying to kill a frog.
###227 It's not clear how that blind man got in that situation,
###230 like it doesn't make any sense, like why is he here.
###233 He doesn't have the skills or the tools necessary to
###237 complete this task.
###240 There are people out there who say like, oh, sex is this
###243 great, spiritual, life-affirming thing.
###248 Those people have not had sex with me because when I have
###251 sex it's not a spiritual experience.
###253 My second time out, I died on stage.
###255 Though actually dying is probably way less painful than
###257 what I went through.
###258 All Cha Cha's Strom Thurmond style comedy coaching did was
###261 distract me with thoughts of Mexican whorehouses.
###264 Before I did this again, I would need to get drunk,
###267 really drunk.
###269 I've heard that alcohol is supposed to make you more
###270 confident, but instead, eh, fuck, let me try that again.
###274 Have you heard that alcohol is a good way
###275 to calm your nerves?
###277 It's not.
###278 
###283 -Let's everyone please give a warm welcome
###286 to Mr. Harry Cheadle.
###287 
###293 HARRY CHEADLE: So you guys are really attractive for the open
###295 mic audience, anyway.
###296 Oops, I'm gonna take this mic off.
###298 The worst thing isn't not getting a laugh.
###300 Who's going to get laid tonight?
###302 Anyone?
###304 
###306 This is going to go really bad.
###307 The worst thing is knowing that everyone out there knew
###309 you were trying to get a laugh, and that you failed,
###312 and that you're not funny.
###313 Sex is disgusting.
###315 I'll wiggle it around in there for awhile.
###317 And like, oh yeah, that sounds great, let do that.
###319 And that's awesome.
###324 Actually, the worst thing is that you
###326 keep going after that.
###327 This sex material is terrible.
###330 That was my impression of trying to do
###332 sex material, everybody.
###333 It failed.
###335 That was good.
###336 Someone liked my material on bombing.
###338 
###341 Yeah, let me just talk more about how bad I suck.
###343 That would be great.
###346 Man, you know, always.
###349 And then but women, man.
###353 Yeah, that stills needs a little bit of work.
###355 Thank you, guys.
###355 You've been great.
###358 The best part is when it's finally over.
###360 -Alright, Harry Cheadle, everybody.
###362 HARRY CHEADLE: This stuff is the most difficult
###363 thing I've ever done.
###364 And if anyone can get any laugh from anybody in front of
###367 a crowd, that's like amazing.
###370 And anyone who does it for a long time deserves your
###372 respect or your pity, I don't know which.
###376 Jesus Christ.
