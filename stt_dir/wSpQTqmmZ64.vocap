###5 <i>Oh my God I can't</i> <i>believe I'm about to do this,</i>
###8 What's wrong?
###10 - l lost my mop. - Really?
###13 No. But that's the only thing that could make me unhappy, right?
###17 You people think of me as nothing but The Janitor.
###20 - That's not true. - What's my name?
###24 l know that the nurses call you Sir Plunge-a-lot.
###28 - l know. - Come on.
###30 - l'm sure you don't know my name so... - John Michael Dorian.
###34 - How did you know my middle name? - Because l care.
###38 <i>Today seems like a good day to</i> <i>hide out in one of my patient's rooms,</i>
###42 You, my friend, are an incompetent fool!
###44 <i>Unless of course</i> <i>my patient is missing,</i>
###46 Where's my brother?
###48 Say, ''l don't know,'' l'll show you what l learned in my crotch-punching class.
###53 l think it's great that you're going back to school.
###57 Why would he wander off? Oh, maybe he went to a real hospital.
###61 He found out he had leukaemia yesterday.
###63 That's life-changing news. You can't be surprised if he's depressed.
###68 Hey, doc!
###69 This guy's got something on his shoulder. Take a look.
###72 Ben, put the small children down.
###75 ls anybody missing one of these?
###77 OK!
###79 You heard the doctor. Sit this one out.
###81 - Please... - My hands are free to...
###83 No, no, Ben! Seriously, Ben! Ben! No, come on, Ben!
###86 Stop, Ben. Put me down. Ben!
###89 Faster!
###94 Eagle!
###97 You had enough?
###103 - Sad. - You want a turn?
###105 - Come on. - Don't you dare! Don't you dare! No!
###109 - No! Ben, put me down! No! - Get a shot of the mean lady.
###113 Hey, shorty. You short person,
###115 you take that picture, you'll be glad you're in a hospital. Help!
###133 You've got a Christmas card right there.
###136 You're funny. l don't understand why you refuse to put on a gown.
###140 Because l don't like people to see my bum.
###142 - So wear underwear. - You know how l feel about underwear.
###145 Every girl who came to our house in the mid-'80s
###148 - knows how you feel. - Sweatpants years.
###150 l don't like that much freedom down there. Makes me tingle in my giblets.
###154 lf you don't start taking this seriously...
###157 <i>I'm a good intern but when</i> <i>you're dealing with disease and family</i>
###160 <i>an intern just doesn't cut it,</i> <i>What you need,,,</i>
###164 <i>,,,is a hero,</i>
###165 Shut up. Shut up. And definitely shut up.
###168 But, l didn't say any...
###170 l know, but l enjoy saying it to you. OK, here's the deal.
###173 lf we're gonna beat this thing, and we damn sure are,
###176 we'll do it one way and one way only:
###178 - We're gonna be a team, team, team. - l hear you, Dr Cox.
###182 l am so not speaking to you, Rhonda, thank you.
###185 l'm sorry, l'm very excited. Go!
###187 What do you say, children? Are we a team?
###189 l'm in.
###192 Go Team Cancer.
###194 <i>Wow he did it,</i>
###196 l've got to go take care of some other patients.
###202 l don't believe it. l didn't get tomorrow's Whipple procedure.
###206 - l know. - This is ridiculous.
###207 Calm down.
###208 What's a brother got to do to get a Whipple? What's a brother got to do?
###213 Listen. You've got to stop turning your medical training
###216 into some ego-driven contest. No one else is doing that.
###221 Oh, l got the Whipple.
###223 Suck it, Turk.
###225 - l will end her. - No, no.
###227 - Dude, let her go. - Let go of me.
###229 lt'll be so hot.
###232 Can you tell me the treatment regimen for organophosphate toxicity, Dr Reid?
###237 l would give intramuscular epinephrine,
###239 then lV calcium gluconate, and emergency haemodialysis.
###243 lf l wanted you to give me three wrong answers in a row
###246 l would have just asked for ''the usual.''
###249 Dr Murphy, care to jump in?
###251 l think it's...
###254 - Do you have a speech impediment? - Excuse me?
###256 You insist on starting every answer with ''um.''
###259 So you've either got a speech impediment
###262 or you're a stammering know-nothing who doesn't belong in medicine.
###266 Well spoken.
###268 Now, get out! All of you! Get out!
###270 Get out! Out! Out! Out!
###274 Jumpin' Jupiter, l do enjoy the tough love.
###277 They probably like it too, whether they admit it or not.
###280 Well...
###282 ''Oh, the old guy's so tough on me, but l love him.'' Right?
###287 Right? They hate you, Bob.
###290 They hate you from your hooves to the top of your pitchfork.
###293 They hate you, dear God, they hate you good.
###297 What're you laughing at?
###299 That ''hooves'' and ''pitchfork'' part.
###303 - Why? - No reason.
###307 Now, do you think you can make Ben behave like a patient or not?
###312 No problem.
###315 - l got him to put his gown on. - He sure did.
###318 And now my butt itches on account of this scratchy chair.
###321 What're we watching?
###323 <i>Wings,</i> And shut up, l like the cab driver. He slays me.
###327 Antonio. Played by the actor Tony Shalhoub,
###330 also particularly fantastic in a film called <i>Big Night,</i>
###333 Congratulations. Your DiMaggio-like streak for saying nothing
###336 even remotely interesting is still alive and well.
###341 <i>I didn't care about the abuse,</i>
###343 <i>The most amazing thing was to</i> <i>watch how Dr Cox dealt with his friend,</i>
###347 <i>How he made him feel safe,</i>
###349 - Do l have to get a special doctor? - An oncologist.
###352 Do we have to talk about this? You must have something else on your mind.
###355 Nope. Just pretty much that leukaemia thing.
###360 Ben, leukaemia is a petty, ugly illness
###364 and we'll not dignify it by speaking of it
###366 unless absolutely necessary. ls that clear to you?
###370 Gotcha.
###374 You are such a stud.
###377 That was interesting.
###380 So, Doctor Wen.
###382 You asked Bonnie to assist you with this Whipple procedure?
###385 - Yes, l did. - Thanks again, sir.
###393 l guess we should just let it go.
###395 l mean, neither one of us wants to do anything to make it worse, right?
###402 You guys ever notice how you're both Asian?
###407 Your mother's maiden name is Turner.
###410 So you used your key to get into my personnel file. Big deal.
###415 Your first kiss was with Sarah Briggs
###418 at the embarrassing age of 1 6.
###421 She wore a green turtleneck.
###422 You wonder sometimes if she still thinks about you. l'm guessing no.
###427 - How could you possibly know that? - l'm your father.
###440 Good morning, Dr Dorian.
###442 You probably don't notice it yourself, but this hospital is a freak show.
###446 This is my band.
###448 We're all working from different departments in the hospital.
###452 - <i>Legal</i> - <i>Accounting</i>
###454 - <i>Shipping and Receiving</i> - <i>Online Property Management</i>
###456 <i>Including Pest Control</i> <i>Night Time Security</i>
###459 <i>And Non-Arboreal</i> <i>Gardening Services</i>
###463 That's... That's just great.
###465 We mostly do a cappella versions of cartoon theme songs.
###487 Dr Reid, l hope l wasn't too harsh on you
###490 - at rounds this morning. - Oh, it's OK, sir.
###492 l don't hate myself much more than usual.
###494 Well, turnabout's fair play, and all that, so here's an evaluation form.
###499 l figured l'd try to get a read on how all you interns think l'm doing.
###503 Don't sign your name.
###505 lt's completely anonymous, and Dr Reid, l'm no she-doc.
###508 l can take it.
###513 - You're going to crush him, right? - Oh, yes.
###516 - How do you spell ''inadequate''? - Give me that.
###519 l'll fill it out for you.
###521 So, Mr Sullivan, your blast percentage
###524 is quite a bit higher than we all expected. Around 80 percent.
###527 That's bad, right? You want the number to be low, huh? Like in golf?
###531 Yes, exactly. Like in golf. Do you play?
###535 Oh, who the hell cares if he plays golf?
###538 l was bonding.
###539 You're doing a good job too.
###541 Oh, thanks.
###542 Who is this clown?
###544 Paul here is the best oncologist in the room,
###546 so why don't we all just clam up and listen.
###549 - We need to start chemo. - When?
###553 This afternoon.
###556 l'm afraid this afternoon doesn't work for me.
###558 lronically, l have a golf game to get to.
###561 Benji, don't sweat it. Come on, give me a break.
###564 You gonna be there?
###565 l've got a thousand patients to look after, so no,
###568 l'll probably miss this first one, but l will leave
###570 my lovely and talented assistant, Kimmy, OK?
###575 Yeah, sure, you know, OK.
###577 - Oh, am l Kimmy? - No, l'm Kimmy.
###580 Oh! Good.
###587 Carla torched Dr Kelso for me.
###590 No matter what l wrote, l always brought it back to sexual inadequacy.
###595 - So good. - Hello, ladies.
###597 - Hey, Doug. - Hey, Doug.
###599 What did you write on Kelso's evaluation?
###601 - What evaluation? - You didn't get yours yet?
###604 Nobody got one.
###609 <i>Around here bad behaviour</i> <i>comes back to haunt you,</i>
###612 Dr Wen, l want to take this opportunity
###614 to once again apologise to you and the entire Asian community.
###619 l'll pass it on at the next big meeting.
###621 You know, Christopher,
###623 surgeons don't have to be shallow, rank-obsessed clich√©s.
###627 So who's the best surgical intern?
###630 ls it Bonnie? ls it me? Come on, l just, l gotta know.
###635 The periampullary carcinoma patient had a failed stenting of the bile duct.
###640 l wanna prep him for a pylorus sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy.
###643 Thanks.
###645 Wassup, T-Man! Show the Todd some love.
###653 Ben seemed pretty down after you left,
###655 so l could cover and you could hang out.
###658 You're a lamb, but you don't have to.
###660 - l don't mind. lt's... - Newbie, stop.
###662 <i>It's funny how people</i> <i>handle bad news in different ways,</i>
###668 <i>Some people have</i> <i>a visceral reaction,</i>
###674 Time to get my soapy-soap on.
###677 <i>Some people go into denial,</i>
###678 No way.
###680 <i>And others,,,</i>
###682 What chance do you give a guy with Ben's blast percentage? Huh?
###685 Twenty percent? Thirty...maybe?
###688 You see, l can't handle that. l cannot.
###691 So, no thank you there, Johnny.
###695 <i>Others just walk away,</i>
###703 <i>Chemotherapy looks harmless</i>

###713 So where's my Tonka truck?
###718 - Score. - The earth-mover. Can l see?
###721 Ah, see it with your eyes, man, not with your hands. See?
###725 l can't believe Perry bailed on you. Typical.
###728 He's always out the door if things get too real.
###732 <i>This is the true story,</i>
###734 True story!

###739 <i>To find out what happens</i> <i>when people stop being polite,,,</i>
###742 <i>And start being real,</i>
###747 - He didn't bail. - lf he did, he's a total wuss.
###759 You said you were giving evaluations to all the interns.
###762 Well, not all at once, sweetheart.
###764 With your way there'd be no accountability. No back and forth.
###767 You wouldn't have to explain to me why, let's see...
###771 ...''l'm most likely frustrated
###773 because l haven't gotten any since the Bay of Pigs.''
###776 Oh, sir, l'm so sorry.
###779 Are we cool?
###781 What could have possessed you to write such filth?
###784 l need to tell you something...
###786 No, that's OK, Carla, l'm gonna take care of that patient.
###791 Dr Kelso, l did it because l didn't think that you'd know it was me
###794 and l thought that it would be funny.
###796 Let's take a walk.
###798 l'd like to tell you a few things that l think are funny.
###807 Oh, come on, how could this guy be the best?
###811 You want to know the difference between you?
###813 When you're working l can always see your wheels turning.
###817 You're thinking about what to do next, what could go wrong.
###820 You're not in the moment.
###821 And as much as it pains me to say this, the Todd is.
###826 <i>Please, Just because I'm thorough</i>

###849 You like feel of cashmere on your skin.
###851 - How are you doing this? - That's right, you run away!
###854 Run away from the truth!
###857 Look, Dr Cox, l've been doing a lot of thinking,
###860 and l think the only reason you're not down at that hospital right now
###864 is that you're afraid.
###867 l think you're right. l do.
###871 That's partly because you've really gotten to know me this year,
###875 but mostly it's because, well...
###879 ...l told you that l was afraid earlier.
###881 Don't tell me you've come here to reiterate things
###884 l've already said, because l know the things that l've said.
###887 ln fact, l'm the one who said them.
###891 You've got to get back in the game, Coxie.
###894 ''Coxie'' was a mistake. Pretend l didn't say Coxie.
###897 Get out.
###899 Look, l... lt boggles my mind that you would just bail on a patient.
###902 A patient is a stranger in a bed
###905 that you can distance yourself from when you need to.
###907 Ben is my friend.
###911 l'm gonna try to visit him over the next couple of weeks,
###914 but if l can't, then that'll be very sad for me,
###919 but really, it'll just mean that l'm human.
###923 Oh, and newbie,
###926 please don't think that you've come here because Ben needs me.
###930 You're here because you're scared
###932 that you might have to rely on yourself for the first time.
###936 And that...
###937 That is just the saddest thing of all.
###948 <i>I think one of the most universal</i> <i>human experiences is feeling alone,</i>
###952 <i>You'd never know</i> <i>but there's tons of people</i>

###961 <i>Maybe you realised that you aren't</i> <i>as self-sufficient as you thought,</i>

###988 because l'm all about the upside, and one day,
###991 l'm going to own this place. That's right. All of this here,
###994 all of this right here
###995 is gonna be the Chris Turk Wing.
###1002 Dr Kelso, l wrote that evaluation. lt was me. Elliot didn't write a word.
###1009 But l would've written every word if l'd had the courage...
###1012 ...and the other-side-of-the-tracks upbringing Carla did.
###1015 - You want to know what l think of you? - You tell him.
###1022 You're mean.
###1024 <i>As for me I decided</i> <i>that if Dr Cox couldn't do it</i>
###1029 <i>well then I would have</i> <i>to be the one there for Ben,</i>
###1061 - Oh, thank God. - Goodbye, newbie.
###1064 So, you know, what's up?
###1069 You know, this and that. Hey, l met someone.
###1072 - Really? - Yeah.
###1074 But she took a stool sample so l think she works here.
###1077 Redhead? Tall?
###1081 - Not on the staff, no. - No?
###1085 What a strange young lady.
###1087 Are we just gonna sit around here
###1088 and make jokes the rest of the day? ls that the drill?
###1092 Listen, if it makes you uncomfortable, then you can just bolt again.

###1100 All right, fine.
###1109 Aw, man, l love you,
###1112 but you're a complete wuss.
###1115 l guess l got a little scared.
###1118 Well, let me know if there's anything l can do
###1120 to help you through this rough patch.
###1123 Give me a break. l'm not good at this stuff. You know that.
###1126 - lt's OK. - l don't like the big conversations.
###1129 lt's cool.
