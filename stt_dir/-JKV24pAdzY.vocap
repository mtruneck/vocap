###3 MALE SPEAKER: Put your hands up.
###4 HANS: No.
###5 MALE SPEAKER: But I've got a gun.
###6 HANS: I don't care.
###7 MALE SPEAKER: But it doesn't make any sense.
###10 HANS: Too bad.
###13 COLIN FARRELL: Every now and then, you read something and
###14 it slaps you in the face.
###15 It gets you by the back of the head and slams you off a table
###16 and gives you a kick in the arse.
###18 It just really takes you on a wonderful ride.
###21 MARTY: Oh, great.
###22 You know what that it?
###23 Do you know what that is?
###24 HANS: Great.
###25 MARTY: That's just fucking great.
###27 MARTIN MCDONAGH: I think the tone is similar to "Bruges."
###30 there's always a degree of humor running through it.
###33 COLIN FARRELL: "In Bruges" was funny as fuck.
###35 WOODY HARRELSON: Kind of proved that he was capable of
###38 not just writing, but really being a great director.
###41 He makes everybody feel, you know, part
###43 of something special.
###45 SAM ROCKWELL: He knows exactly what he wants.
###46 He has a very particular visual aesthetic, as well as
###50 what he wants going on emotionally.
###52 CHARLIE: Don't give me that moany fucking face, OK?
###56 MARTY: Ow!
###58 MARTIN MCDONAGH: This was almost like a puzzle, like a
###61 gigantic kind of jigsaw.
###63 BILLY: Don't get technical on me.
###64 MARTIN MCDONAGH: The canvas is pretty big and cinematic.
###66 ABBIE CORNISH: It had a comedic edge to it.
###68 BILLY: Who's better than you?
###69 MARTY: Who's better than you?
###69 BILLY: Who's better than you?
###70 MARTY: You're better than me.
###70 BILLY: You're gorgeous.
###71 BILLY: You're the best I ever known.
###73 BILLY: I wanna jump inside your pants.
###75 SAM ROCKWELL: There's a lot of hijinks with
###77 me, Woody, and Colin.
###77 And then me, Chris, and Colin have to do a
###80 lot of stuff together.
###81 That was a lot of fun.
###81 WOODY HARRELSON: There's a lot of camaraderie.
###83 But Chris Walken, he's a fucking legend.
###85 To be able to get up there and do a scene with Chris Walken--
###89 I just was in heaven.
###91 MARTY: You ain't gonna fight.
###92 What are you gonna do, then?
###94 HANS: Guess I'm gonna die.
###95 MARTY: Friends don't make their friends die, Hans.
###96 HANS: Psychopathic friends do.
###100 CHRISTOPHER WALKEN: You know, the thing about movies is that
###102 they're always a surprise.
###103 The other night, we were shooting a scene out there in
###106 the desert, and this enormous owl flew right over the set.
###111 For hours, this big owl just kept floating around.
###116 You're not likely to see that unless you're making a movie.
###119 COLIN FARRELL: I've never met anyone like him in my life.
###121 He's so just brilliant.
###123 BILLY: Fucking badass, man.
###124 SAM ROCKWELL: Who-- who do you like?
###125 Who do you like better?
###126 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###127 COLIN FARRELL: The Irish guy's interesting, isn't he?
###129 The Irish guy's interesting.
###129 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###130 SAM ROCKWELL: Very undervalued actor, that Irish kid.
###132 CHRISTOPHER WALKEN: I didn't you were gonna do that.
###133 MARTIN MCDONAGH: This one has got a lot of tenderness and a
###135 big human story at its heart.
###138 BILLY: It's about seven fucking psychopaths.
###140 HANS: I want to know what happens at the end.
###142 SAM ROCKWELL: Well, I don't know if I should reveal that.
###144 That's kind of a plot point.
###145 HANS: Fuck 'em.
