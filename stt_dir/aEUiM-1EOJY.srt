1
0:0:0,26 --> 0:0:9,72
HI EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO BIO 1B. PERHAPS WELCOME
TO CAL TO BERKELEY. FOR SOME OF YOU THIS


2
0:0:9,72 --> 0:0:19,32
MIGHT BE YOUR FIRST LECTURE AT CAL. AND
FOR OTHERS PERHAPS YOUR FIRST COURSE IN INTEGRATIVE


3
0:0:19,32 --> 0:0:27,8
BIOLOGY. SO I'M THE FIRST OF THREE LECTURERS
AS YOU PROBABLY ARE A WAY. DURING THE REGULAR


4
0:0:27,8 --> 0:0:34,39
SEMESTER, DURING THE REGULAR YEAR WE HAVE
THIS COURSE DIVIDED INTO THREE MODULES.


5
0:0:34,39 --> 0:0:44,179
AND THIS YEAR, ECOLOGY IS GOING FIRST, FOLLOWED
BY THE EVOLUTION MODULE WITH DR. JOHN HUELSENBECK


6
0:0:44,179 --> 0:0:53,709
AND THEN THE BOTANY MODULE WITH DR. BRUCE
BALDWIN. THESE MODULES CAN REALLY GO IN


7
0:0:53,709 --> 0:1:3,609
ANY ORDER. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT ECOLOGY
IS GOING FIRST IN SOME YEARS, IF IT'S EVER


8
0:1:3,609 --> 0:1:9,73
GONE FIRST. AND SO WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TO
BUILD ON IN THE  ECOLOGY SECTION IN TERMS


9
0:1:9,73 --> 0:1:18,24
OF BASIC BIOLOGY ANOTHER EXCEPT FOR WHAT
YOU BRING IN FROM YOUR PREVIOUS EDUCATION.


10
0:1:18,24 --> 0:1:25,85
SO I WILL, I CAN'T INTRODUCE ABSOLUTELY
EVERY TERM AND EVERY CONCEPT AS WE GO. I


11
0:1:25,85 --> 0:1:30,75
NEED TO ASSUME SOME THINGS ABOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE.
AND YOU'LL NEED TO DRAW ON YOUR ENTIRE STORE


12
0:1:30,75 --> 0:1:36,7
OF KNOWLEDGE. I'LL BE MENTIONING FAR-FLUNG
COUNTRIES PART ONE OR THE OCCASIONAL ORGANISM


13
0:1:36,7 --> 0:1:44,28
LIKE AN URCHIN. AND I MIGHT JUST ASSUME
THAT EITHER YOU'VE HEARD OF THAT COUNTRY OR


14
0:1:44,28 --> 0:1:52,86
THAT ORGANISM OR THAT YOU WILL TAP IT INTO
GOOGLE AND YOU WILL CHECK ON IT. BUT I WILL


15
0:1:52,86 --> 0:2:2,69
TRY TO SPEAK SLOWLY AND CLEARLY AS POSSIBLE.
THIS COURSE IS DIFFICULT, CERTAINLY. WE


16
0:2:2,69 --> 0:2:9,859
DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. IT'S HARD BUT WE
  SHOULD APOLOGIZE IF IT'S CONFUSING,


17
0:2:9,859 --> 0:2:17,999
UNCLEAR OR DISORGANIZED. HERE WE ARE, THEY
SAY THE GREATEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN THE


18
0:2:17,999 --> 0:2:23,99
WORLD. SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE IF
IT'S HARD. BUT IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO


19
0:2:23,99 --> 0:2:33,19
MAKE IT CLEAR FOR YOU. I'LL PRIMARILY USE
THE BOARD JUST FOR WRITING TERMS. OUTLINING


20
0:2:33,19 --> 0:2:42,849
POINTS. BUT REALLY I'M FOCUSED ON MY SLIDES.
IN THE PRESENTATION. AND I WILL GIVE YOU


21
0:2:42,849 --> 0:2:51,409
A SUBSET OF THESE SLIDES AS A PDF FILE.
THAT WILL GO ON TO BSPACE AFTER THE LECTURES.


22
0:2:51,409 --> 0:3:0,739
ONE OF THE GOALS IN BIO 1B IS TO HELP DEVELOP
YOU AS GOOD NOTETAKERS. AND THAT, THAT MEANS


23
0:3:0,739 --> 0:3:8,719
COMING TO CLASS AND TAKING NOTES WITH AN OLD
FASHIONED PEN OR PENCIL. SO REALLY TRY TO


24
0:3:8,719 --> 0:3:15,269
DO THAT. IT DOES EARLY IN THE DAY. AND IT
WILL BE A STRUGGLE SOMETIMES TO KEEP AWAKE.


25
0:3:15,269 --> 0:3:20,79
BUT THERE ARE GOING TO BE ELEMENTS OF LECTURES
THAT ARE NOT ON THE WEBCAST. PARTICULARLY


26
0:3:20,79 --> 0:3:26,909
VIDEOS THAT I SHOW AND ANY COMMENTS I MAKE
DURING CERTAIN VIDEOS. AND IT'S JUST A FACT


27
0:3:26,909 --> 0:3:32,389
OF BIO 1B THAT STUDENTS WHO COME TO LECTURE
PERFORM BETTER. THEY GET HIGHER GRADES.


28
0:3:32,389 --> 0:3:42,299
SO TRY YOUR BEST. OF COURSE, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO MAKE EVERY ONE. LET ME JUST COMMENT ON


29
0:3:42,299 --> 0:3:48,1
A COUPLE OF OTHER COURSE LOGISTICAL MATTERS.
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANYMORE TIME ON THIS.


30
0:3:48,1 --> 0:3:52,68
WE HAVE TOO MAN LOGISTICAL THINGS TO DO.


31
0:3:52,68 --> 0:4:0,779
BUT I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT YOUR BOOK, THE
EIGHTH EDITION OF CAMPBELL, IS THE ONE OF


32
0:4:0,779 --> 0:4:11,19
THIS SHADE OF MAROON AND BLACK. AND IT'S
AVAILABLE AT THE LOCAL STORES. I THINK NED'S


33
0:4:11,19 --> 0:4:17,69
IS THE ONLY ONE STOCKING THE BOOK RIGHT NOW
WITH SUCH THAT YOU CAN USE THIS 10 PERCENT


34
0:4:17,69 --> 0:4:23,54
OFF COUPON. YOU CAN ALSO FIND IT AT VARIOUS
OTHER PLACES, INCLUDING ON-LINE. THE EIGHTH


35
0:4:23,54 --> 0:4:29,28
EDITION IS WHAT  WE'RE USING. IT BEHOOVES
YOU TO USE THE EIGHTH. I'VE GIVEN ONLY THE


36
0:4:29,28 --> 0:4:35,72
READING ASSIGNMENTS ON THE COURSE WEBSITES.
BUT ON THE PDF I JUST PUT UP THIS MORNING


37
0:4:35,72 --> 0:4:41,7
ON BSPACE I DO PROVIDE A CONVERSION FOR THE
SEVENTH EDITION. WHICH SOME OF YOU MIGHT


38
0:4:41,7 --> 0:4:47,87
CARRY FROM OTHER COURSES. THEY'RE NOT THE
SAME BOOK.


39
0:4:47,87 --> 0:4:52,93
AND I THINK YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT BUT
YOU DO YOURSELF A SMALL DISSERVICE BY USING


40
0:4:52,93 --> 0:4:58,74
THE OLD EDITION. IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU,
IT'S OKAY WITH ME. I'LL PROVIDE THE CONVERSIONS


41
0:4:58,74 --> 0:5:5,41
FOR THAT ON B SPACE. IT'S UP THERE ALREADY.
MAKE SURE YOU GET IN THE SWING OF BSPACE IF


42
0:5:5,41 --> 0:5:11,59
YOU'VE NEVER USED IT BEFORE BY MONDAY. NO
LABS NEXT WEEK. AS MIKE MENTIONED. YOU DO


43
0:5:11,59 --> 0:5:16,64
HAVE YOUR DISCUSSION SECTIONS. AND THEN
A WEEK OFF DISCUSSION AND LAB. AND THE FOLLOWING


44
0:5:16,64 --> 0:5:23,89
WEEK DISCUSSIONS AND LABS START FULL FORCE.
WE'RE EASING INTO THE SEMESTER NICELY. WE


45
0:5:23,89 --> 0:5:36,53
DON'T NEED TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING TOO FAST
HERE.
TODAY I'M FOCUSED ON BY WAY OF INTRODUCING


46
0:5:36,53 --> 0:5:47,85
WHAT ECOLOGY IS, I'M REALLY FOCUSED ON THE
HISTORY OF ECOLOGY. I LIKE TO INTRODUCE


47
0:5:47,85 --> 0:5:54,42
TOPICS FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE WHEN
POSSIBLE. I'M REALLY DOING THAT TODAY, REACHING


48
0:5:54,42 --> 0:6:4,81
BACK TO LOOK AT THE ROOTS OF ECOLOGY IN
ORDER TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA WHAT ECOLOGY IS


49
0:6:4,81 --> 0:6:12,14
AND ECOLOGISTS DO.


50
0:6:12,14 --> 0:6:19,27
I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH KNOWLEDGE OR AWARENESS
OF ECOLOGY WHEN I GOT TO COLLEGE. PARTLY


51
0:6:19,27 --> 0:6:24,93
THAT'S BECAUSE ECOLOGY HAS REALLY TAKEN
OFF SINCE I WAS IN COLLEGE. ECOLOGY HAS BEEN


52
0:6:24,93 --> 0:6:34,9
FOLLOWING AN EXPONTENTIAL GROWTH CURVE. AND
THERE'S A LOT MORE AWARENESS OF ECOLOGY


53
0:6:34,9 --> 0:6:39,53
BECAUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS THAT WE
FACE. BUT THERE'S A, THERE'S JUST AN EXPANSION


54
0:6:39,53 --> 0:6:44,37
WITHIN THE SCIENCE ITSELF THAT IS REAL,
THAT HAS OCCURRED OVER THE LAST  MANY


55
0:6:44,37 --> 0:6:49,8
YEARS, MY HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY CLASSES MAY
NOT HAVE BEEN UP TO SNUFF. THAT MIGHT BE PART


56
0:6:49,8 --> 0:6:56,41
OF IT TOO. I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT SURE.
BUT SOME OF YOU, FOR SOME OF YOU ECOLOGY WILL


57
0:6:56,41 --> 0:7:3,3
BE A NEW FIELD OF STUDY. AND WHAT I WANTED
TO DO TODAY IS TRY TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF


58
0:7:3,3 --> 0:7:11,66
WHAT IT IS. SO WE'LL BE LOOKING INTO ITS ROOTS.
IN BASIC NATURAL HISTORY OBSERVATION, AND


59
0:7:11,66 --> 0:7:17,68
WE'LL BE LOOKING AT SOME EXAMPLES OF NATURAL
HISTORY AND HOW IT FED THE ECOLOGICAL CONTINUES


60
0:7:17,68 --> 0:7:28,9
TRADITION AND HOW IT CONTINUES TO FEED ECOLOGY
TODAY. WE'LL LOOK AT SOME EXEMPLARS OF THAT


61
0:7:28,9 --> 0:7:36,83
NATURAL HISTORY TRADITION AND START TO APPROACH
DEFINITIONS OF ECOLOGY AS WE GET INTO THE


62
0:7:36,83 --> 0:7:47,6
20TH CENTURY. AND TRY TO, WE'LL TRY TO SHOW
THAT ECOLOGY IS AN INTEGRATIVE DISCIPLINE.


63
0:7:47,6 --> 0:7:51,38
IT INTEGRATES FIELD WORK LABORATORY WORK


64
0:7:51,38 --> 0:7:59,75
WITH THEORETICAL AND MODELING WORK. AND
FINALLY WE'LL DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN ECOLOGY


65
0:7:59,75 --> 0:8:16,58
AND ENVIRONMENTALISM. WITH A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES.
NATURAL HISTORY. IT'S KIND OF OLD FASHIONED


66
0:8:16,58 --> 0:8:24,45
IN SOME CONTEXT THESE DAYS, THE IDEA OF
NATURAL HISTORY. BUT AT BERKELEY IT'S STILL


67
0:8:24,45 --> 0:8:31,36
TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY. NATURAL HISTORY DEFINE
AS THE STUDY OF NATURE AND NATURAL PHENOMENON


68
0:8:31,36 --> 0:8:37,779
USUALLY BASED ON OBSERVATION AND DESCRIPTION.
WE STILL HAVE COURSES IN NATURAL HISTORY HERE


69
0:8:37,779 --> 0:8:45,49
IN THIS DEPARTMENT.


70
0:8:45,49 --> 0:8:55,529
NATURAL HISTORY IS OFTEN DEPENDENT ON VERY
SIMPLE AND PATIENT OBSERVATION OF NATURAL


71
0:8:55,529 --> 0:9:4,68
PHENOMENA. SITTING IN THE FIELD AND WATCHING
AN ORGANISM PERFORM A CERTAIN BEHAVIOR,


72
0:9:4,68 --> 0:9:12,87
DESCRIBING A PLANT IN ITS GROWTH, IN THE LABORATORY.
ITS MORPHOLOGY AND ITS MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES


73
0:9:12,87 --> 0:9:20,0
THROUGH TIME. NATURAL HISTORY IS NOT LIMITED
TO THE STUDY OF BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA TO


74
0:9:20,0 --> 0:9:27,26
THE STUDY OF LIVING PHENOMENON. WITH ONE WORD,
INTERESTED IN THE TIDES AND THEIR INFLUENCE


75
0:9:27,26 --> 0:9:36,97
ON THE GEOLOGY OF THE BAY, THAT WOULD BE A
STUDY IN NATURAL HISTORY. IT ENCOMPASSES THE


76
0:9:36,97 --> 0:9:43,1
FULL RANGE OF NATURAL PHENOMENON, WHETHER
PHYSICAL OR CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL. BUT


77
0:9:43,1 --> 0:9:50,2
GENERALLY WHEN USING THE TERM IN BIOLOGY,
WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT A DESCRIPTIVE AND OBSERVATION-BASED


78
0:9:50,2 --> 0:9:57,58
STUDY OF ORGANISMS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP
TO THE ENVIRONMENT. WE ARE FORTUNATE TO BE


79
0:9:57,58 --> 0:10:6,339
LIVING IN THE MOST DIVERSE STATE IN THE COUNTRY
IN TERMS OF ITS BIOLOGY. AND HERE IN NORTHERN


80
0:10:6,339 --> 0:10:13,35
CALIFORNIA AROUND THE BAY WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE
WITH AN AMAZING LOCAL ECOSYSTEM IN TERMS OF


81
0:10:13,35 --> 0:10:24,12
ITS DIVERSITY AND A RICH HISTORY AND A LOT
OF RESOURCES FOR ITS STUDY, LOCALLY. AND


82
0:10:24,12 --> 0:10:33,97
IF ONE WHERE STUDYING, ZOOPLANKTON OR SHARKS
OR BLUE HERONS ON THE BAY, BY OBSERVATION


83
0:10:33,97 --> 0:10:42,25
AND DOCUMENTATION OF THOSE OBSERVATIONS,
WHETHER PHOTOGRAPHIC, WRITTEN, OR EVEN WITHOUT


84
0:10:42,25 --> 0:10:49,2
FORMAL DOCUMENTATION AT ALL, ONE IS CONDUCTING
A NATURAL HISTORY. BUT THE BEST NATURAL


85
0:10:49,2 --> 0:11:2,89
HISTORY DOES INVOLVE CLEAR DOCUMENTATION AND
A CAREFUL RECORDING OF OBSERVATIONS.
IN TRYING TO ELUCIDATE THE IDEA A LITTLE BETTER,


86
0:11:2,89 --> 0:11:14,67
WE'RE GOING TO GO WAY BACK TO SOME 30,000,
32,000 YEARS AGO. KA HERE, WE'LL JUST NOTE


87
0:11:14,67 --> 0:11:27,79
IT NOW BECAUSE I'LL BE COMING BACK TO IT
EVENTUALLY. I'LL HAVE TO ERASE THIS NOW.


88
0:11:27,79 --> 0:11:36,91
WE'LL BE WORKING VERY CONSISTENTLY AT THE
INTERFACE OF PRESENT TIME AND PAST TIME


89
0:11:36,91 --> 0:11:45,8
AT THE INTERFACE OF PALEO AND NEO, OF THE
OLD AND THE NEW. AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THOSE


90
0:11:45,8 --> 0:11:50,51
CASES WHERE I SHOULD ELUCIDATE BECAUSE YOU
MAY NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION AT YOUR DISPOSAL


91
0:11:50,51 --> 0:11:56,82
ALREADY. WHAT I MEAN BY THE IDEA OF KA, ALL
I'M MEANING IS THOUSANDS OF  YEARS.


92
0:11:56,82 --> 0:12:13,839
K STANDING FOR KILO AND A ATOM. YOU MIGHT
SEE MY USE CAPITAL MA, MEGA ANUM, MILLIONS


93
0:12:13,839 --> 0:12:28,8
OF YEARS. I HAVE PARTICULAR INTERESTS IN
PALEONTOLOGY. AND WE'LL BE USING THE HISTORICAL


94
0:12:28,8 --> 0:12:37,77
RECORD CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE COURSE.
THERE YOU GO FOR THOSE IN TV LAND. WATCHING


95
0:12:37,77 --> 0:12:50,21
AT HOME. OKAY. KA, THOUSANDS OF YEARS. MA,
MILLIONS OF YEARS. OKAY. SO CHAUVET CAVE


96
0:12:50,21 --> 0:12:59,72
IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS DISCOVERED IN THE MID
90'S IN 1994. BY SPELUNKERS, BY CAVE ENTHUSIASTS,


97
0:12:59,72 --> 0:13:7,52
NOT SCIENTISTS, WHO WENT INTO THE DEEP RECESSES
OF ONE OF THESE CAVE SYSTEMS AND DISCOVERED


98
0:13:7,52 --> 0:13:17,49
FABULOUS GALLERIES OF ROCK ART ON THE WALLS
OF THESE CAVES. NOW MANY SITES LIKE THIS


99
0:13:17,49 --> 0:13:26,1
WERE KNOWN IN EUROPE. AND MANY SITES AROUND
THE WORLD DOCUMENT THE ARTISTIC ACTIVITIES


100
0:13:26,1 --> 0:13:35,52
OF HUMANS OVER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS
IN AUSTRALIA AND AFRICA. HERE IN THESE CAVES


101
0:13:35,52 --> 0:13:39,73
OF WESTERN EUROPE YOU HAVE EXQUISITE PRESERVATION
OF THE


102
0:13:39,73 --> 0:13:44,29
PAINTINGS ON THESE WALLS AS A RESULT OF THE
UNIQUE ENVIRONMENTS OF THOSE CAVE SYSTEMS.


103
0:13:44,29 --> 0:13:55,48
  SO HERE AT CHAUVET, WHEN THE CAVE EXPLORERS
BROUGHT ATTENTION TO THIS DISCOVERY AND


104
0:13:55,48 --> 0:14:1,4
SCIENTISTS WENT IN, THEY OBSERVED SOME PAINTINGS
SUCH AS THIS. PANELS ON THE WALL AND ALSO


105
0:14:1,4 --> 0:14:7,6
ON THE WALLS YOU GET A SENSE OF SCALE ON
THAT GUYS'S HEAD OF THE HORSES, SOMETHING


106
0:14:7,6 --> 0:14:14,81
RELATED TO  HORSES. SOMETHING IN THE FAMILY.
YOU RECOGNIZE THEM AS SOMETHING HORSE LIKE.


107
0:14:14,81 --> 0:14:21,22
MAYBE ZEBRA LIKE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. REMEMBER
THIS IS WESTERN EUROPE. 30 TO 32,000 YEARS


108
0:14:21,22 --> 0:14:26,47
AGO. SOMETHING IN THERE. YOU NOT ONLY HAVE
THESE PANELS OF ILLUSTRATION, YOU HAVE ON


109
0:14:26,47 --> 0:14:33,36
THE FLOOR OF THESE CAVES, YOU HAVE BONES.
YOU HAVE FOSSIL BONES. SO YOU CAN START TO


110
0:14:33,36 --> 0:14:40,43
INTERPRET YOUR PAINTINGS WITH REFERENCE TO
THE BONES AND TEETH. IN SOME CASES FECES,


111
0:14:40,43 --> 0:14:47,7
THE SCAT, THE POO OF THESE ORGANISMS. ALL
OF  THESE THINGS YOU USE TO RECONSTRUCT


112
0:14:47,7 --> 0:14:51,56
YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THESE THINGS ARE
AND WHAT THE PEOPLE WHO PAINTED THESE THINGS


113
0:14:51,56 --> 0:15:0,39
WERE DOING. POSSIBLY THINKING. THE BIG PANEL
LIKE THIS YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING LIKE A RHINOCEROS


114
0:15:0,39 --> 0:15:7,93
HERE. PRETTY CLEAR RHINO FORM, MAYBE INDICATING
THE MOVEMENT OF THE HORNS THERE. ELEPHANT


115
0:15:7,93 --> 0:15:16,8
LIKE FORMS HERE. WHAT ARE THESE BACK HERE?
FIND MAYBE A BABY ELEPHANT THERE. WHAT'S


116
0:15:16,8 --> 0:15:20,93
THAT? IT'S A BEAR. RIGHT? YOU RECOGNIZE IT
AS A BEAR.


117
0:15:20,93 --> 0:15:24,98
IT'S GOT THE LITTLE EARS, IT'S GOT THE SHORT
MUZZLE. IT'S GOT THE LITTLE FACE. IT'S A


118
0:15:24,98 --> 0:15:32,39
BEAR. DARN IT. YOU RECOGNIZE IT BECAUSE IT'S
SO WELL DEPICTED. IT CAPTURES THE FEATURES


119
0:15:32,39 --> 0:15:39,72
OF THAT ORGANISM SO WELL THAT IT'S JUST
WITH A FEW STROKES NOT ONLY WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL


120
0:15:39,72 --> 0:15:45,279
IT IS, GENERALLY SPEAKING, BUT SOMETHING
ABOUT WHAT IT'S DOING. THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL,


121
0:15:45,279 --> 0:15:52,6
THE PERSON WHO PAINTED THIS HAS MADE CLEAR
NATURAL HISTORY OBSERVATIONS DURING THEIR


122
0:15:52,6 --> 0:15:57,55
LIFETIME. THERE'S NO BEAR POSING FOR THIS
PICTURE. THEY'RE GOING ON THEIR MEMORY AND


123
0:15:57,55 --> 0:16:7,8
EXPERIENCES OF BEARS. AND THESE ARE NOT BEARS
THAT ARE ALIVE TODAY. THESE ARE DIFFERENT


124
0:16:7,8 --> 0:16:14,82
SPECIES OF BEAR. THEY'RE CAVE BEARS, VERY
COMMON DURING THIS PERIOD IN WESTERN EUROPE.


125
0:16:14,82 --> 0:16:22,74
MORE VEGETARIAN MAYBE THAN SOME OF THE BIG
BEARS TODAY. BUT A BEAR NONETHELESS, A MEMBER


126
0:16:22,74 --> 0:16:29,3
OF THE BEAR FAMILY. WHAT ARE THOSE? THAT
WERE CREEPING UP BEHIND THE BABY ELEPHANT?


127
0:16:29,3 --> 0:16:47,4
LIONS. LIONS IN FRANCE? YEAH. MAYBE A SUBSPECIES
OF THE LIVING LION. TAXONOMY IS ALWAYS CONTROVERSIAL.


128
0:16:47,4 --> 0:16:55,42
THE TAXONOMY, THE NAMING OF THESE CREATURES.
AT WHAT LEVEL WE RANK THEM. BUT THEY'RE CLEARLY


129
0:16:55,42 --> 0:17:4,89
LIONS. AND TAKING EVERYTHING INTO CONTEXT
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE IN A HUNT. AND YOU


130
0:17:4,89 --> 0:17:8,429
CAN EVEN LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR
OF  THESE EXTINCT POPULATIONS OF LIONS


131
0:17:8,429 --> 0:17:15,92
FROM THESE PAINTINGS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO CAREFULLY
DOCUMENTED. THEY TURN OUT NOT TO HAVE A BIG


132
0:17:15,92 --> 0:17:28,189
SHAGGY MANE. THEY DON'T HAVE A BIG MALE
KING OF THE BEASTS LION'S
MANE. IN SOME CASES IT LOOKS LIKE THE MALES


133
0:17:28,189 --> 0:17:36,17
ARE IN THE LEAD BECAUSE THE  ONES IN THE
FRONT HAVE TESTICLES. PERHAPS UNLIKE THE LIONS


134
0:17:36,17 --> 0:17:43,71
TODAY, MAYBE THE MALES TOOK MORE OF A LEAD
IN THESE PACK HUNTING STRATEGIES WHERE IT


135
0:17:43,71 --> 0:17:48,86
TENDS TO BE A FEMALE LED STRATEGY TODAY. YOU
CAN ACTUALLY LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT BIOLOGY


136
0:17:48,86 --> 0:17:50,14
OF THESE CREATURES AS A RESULT OF THE


137
0:17:50,14 --> 0:17:56,8
CAREFUL DOCUMENTATION AND DEPICTION OF THESE
ORGANISMS BY THESE ARTISTS. ANOTHER POINT


138
0:17:56,8 --> 0:18:2,13
WHERE I SHOULD JUST STOP AND IT WOULD BE
GREAT TO BE BUILDING ON THE EVOLUTION SECTION


139
0:18:2,13 --> 0:18:9,25
IN DISCUSSING SOME OF THIS, BUT I SHOULD
STOP AND NOTE THE STRUCTURE OF THESE NAMES.


140
0:18:9,25 --> 0:18:15,19
THIS IS JUST A COMMON NAME. THAT'S OUR ENGLISH
NAME. IT'S NOT STANDARDIZED. WE CALL THESE


141
0:18:15,19 --> 0:18:20,99
THINGS CAVE LIONS. BUT IN FRENCH THEY'LL CALL
THEM SOMETHING ELSE AND IN JAPANESE THEY'LL


142
0:18:20,99 --> 0:18:30,1
CALL THEM SOMETHING ELSE. WE STANDARDIZED
OUR NAME FOR THIS ORGANISM BY USING THE LATIN


143
0:18:30,1 --> 0:18:36,84
NAME, WHICH WE ITALICIZE, RIGHT? IT'S A GOOD
PLACE TO INTRODUCE THIS HERE BECAUSE I'M


144
0:18:36,84 --> 0:18:41,76
GOING TO TALK ABOUT LINNAEUS IN A SECOND.
LINNAEUS, RIGHT? SORRY, I'M GOING TO HAVE


145
0:18:41,76 --> 0:18:43,9
TO GO TO THE BOARD.


146
0:18:43,9 --> 0:19:2,75
THIS IS MAYBE A NAME YOU RECALL FROM A PREVIOUS
COURSE, LINNEAUS, CAROLUS LINNAEUS. I BELIEVE


147
0:19:2,75 --> 0:19:14,7
HE WAS BORN LIME. BUT HE LATINIZED EVEN
HIS OWN NAME. SO WE KNOW HIM AS LINNAEUS.


148
0:19:14,7 --> 0:19:31,32
FAMOUS FOR ADVANCING A SYSTEM OF NOMENCLATURE.
THE BINOMIAL SYSTEM OF NOMENCLATURE
TO BRING ORGANIZATION TO OUR NAMING OF BIOLOGICAL


149
0:19:31,32 --> 0:19:41,49
ORGANISMS. WHAT HE DID WAS SUGGEST THAT WE
USE A BINOMEN,


150
0:19:41,49 --> 0:19:53,37
A TWO-PART NAME SUCH AS URSUS SPELAEUS. SO
THAT EACH KIND OF ORGANISM,


151
0:19:53,37 --> 0:19:57,1
EACH SPECIES OF ORGANISM WOULD HAVE A TWO-PART
NAME LIKE THIS.


152
0:19:57,1 --> 0:20:5,35
COMPRISED OF A GENOUS AND A SPECIES. THE GENOUS
  THAT WE CAPITALIZE THAT GOES FIRST FOLLOWED


153
0:20:5,35 --> 0:20:11,51
BY THE SPECIFIC EPITHET THAT GOES SECOND
THAT'S NOT CAPITALIZED. IF YOU'RE WRITING


154
0:20:11,51 --> 0:20:16,299
IT ON THE BOARD OR ON PAPER YOU SHOULD UNDERLINE
IT. IF TYPING IT YOU SHOULD ITALICIZE IT.


155
0:20:16,299 --> 0:20:22,58
IF YOU EVER SEE A NAME SUCH AS THIS WITH
A CAPITAL ON THE FIRST WORD AND A LOW CASE


156
0:20:22,58 --> 0:20:28,38
ON THE SECOND WORD IN ITALICS, YOU'RE PROBABLY
DEALING WITH A LATIN NAME, A FORMAL SCIENTIFIC


157
0:20:28,38 --> 0:20:28,98
NAME.


158
0:20:28,98 --> 0:20:37,83
A BINOMEN THAT REPRESENTS A PARTICULAR SPECIES,
A PARTICULAR KIND OF ORGANISM. AND YOU NEED


159
0:20:37,83 --> 0:20:43,21
TO KNOW THIS, IF NOTHING ELSE BY THE END
OF BIO 1B, JUST KNOW THAT. KNOW THAT'S HOW


160
0:20:43,21 --> 0:20:47,799
YOU WRITE A LATIN NAME BECAUSE YOU SEE IT
IN THE NEWSPAPER ALL THE TIME. THEY'LL CAPITALIZE


161
0:20:47,799 --> 0:20:52,61
BOTH WORD. IT JUST LOOKS AWKWARD AND IT
LOOKS AMATEURISH. AFTER GETTING THROUGH BIO


162
0:20:52,61 --> 0:21:3,15
1B YOU WON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE. OKAY. SO
BY WAY OF INTRODUCING LINNAEUS A LITTLE BIT


163
0:21:3,15 --> 0:21:10,84
THERE, LET'S LOOK AT LINNAEUS'S ROLE IN THE
HISTORY OF ECOLOGY. I BRING UP A COUPLE


164
0:21:10,84 --> 0:21:15,88
OF PEOPLE HERE IN PART BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THEY GET THE CREDIT THEY DESERVE IN THE HISTORY


165
0:21:15,88 --> 0:21:29,3
OF ECOLOGY. LINNAEUS'S IDEAS WERE VERY INTERESTING
ACTUALLY. BUT IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THESE


166
0:21:29,3 --> 0:21:34,97
WERE, THE WRITINGS WE ATTRIBUTE TO LINNAEUS
WERE NOT JUST LINNAEUS'S. THE HISTORIANS HAVE


167
0:21:34,97 --> 0:21:41,86
SHOWN THAT MANY OF HIS WRITINGS, ALTHOUGH
PRODUCED UNDER HIS MENTORSHIP, WERE PRODUCED


168
0:21:41,86 --> 0:21:48,57
BY SOMETHING LIKE GRADUATE STUDENTS. THEN
THEIR NAMES FELL OFF THE WORK OVER TIME


169
0:21:48,57 --> 0:21:53,4
AND WE ATTRIBUTE THEM ALL TO LINNAEUS. THAT'S
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR A LONG


170
0:21:53,4 --> 0:22:4,62
TIME. LESS AND LESS AS SCIENCE CONTINUES.
BUT A VERY COMMON THING IN THE PAST. SO


171
0:22:4,62 --> 0:22:10,13
WE DON'T KNOW WHO WROTE THE ECONOMY OF NATURE
  SPECIFICALLY. IT WAS PROBABLY LINNAEUS


172
0:22:10,13 --> 0:22:15,38
AND ONE OF HIS STUDENTS IN SOME COMBINATION.
BUT LINNAEUS IS THE MENTOR IN THIS PROCESS.


173
0:22:15,38 --> 0:22:27,59
AND THIS BRIEF ESSAY ON THE ECONOMY OF NATURE
WAS TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH AND WAS READ.


174
0:22:27,59 --> 0:22:33,919
IT CAN BE VERY HARD TO FIND A COPY OF THIS
ESSAY. AND THE OTHER ESSAYS OF RELEVANCE


175
0:22:33,919 --> 0:22:38,78
THAT LINNAEUS WROTE TODAY. BUT WE HAVE ONE
OF THE BEST LIBRARIES IN THE WORLD HERE,


176
0:22:38,78 --> 0:22:44,9
IN THIS VERY BUILDING. AND YOU CAN FIND
SOME TRANSLATIONS FROM THE 1800S OF THESE


177
0:22:44,9 --> 0:22:48,95
ESSAYS AND YOU SHOULD GO TAKE A LOOK FOR
FUN. MAYBE NOT DURING THE SEMESTER, YOU'RE


178
0:22:48,95 --> 0:22:57,38
TOO BUSY. BUT AFTER STUDYING SOME ECOLOGY
YOU'LL SEE JUST HOW HOW FOUNDATIONAL SOME


179
0:22:57,38 --> 0:23:4,799
OF THESE IDEAS WERE OF LINNAEUS'S. HE SPOKE
OF AN ECONOMY OF NATURE. A SYSTEM OF ORGANISMAL


180
0:23:4,799 --> 0:23:14,75
RELATIONSHIPS OF CHECKS AND BALANCES IN NATURE
THAT GIVE RISE TO THE PATTERNS WE SEE TODAY.


181
0:23:14,75 --> 0:23:21,929
AND HIS PHRASE WAS TAKEN UP AS WE'LL SEE
IN ENGLAND BY DARWIN AND OTHERS, THIS ECONOMY


182
0:23:21,929 --> 0:23:30,919
OF NATURE, THIS IDEA AND THIS PHRASE ECONOMY
OF NATURE. AS AN EXAMPLAR OF THE NATURAL


183
0:23:30,919 --> 0:23:40,799
HISTORY TRADITION, WE CAN FOCUS ON A COUPLE
INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING GILBERT WHITE, WHO


184
0:23:40,799 --> 0:23:48,32
WAS VERY WIDELY READ. HIS ONE BOOK IN PARTICULAR,
THE NATURAL HISTORY OF SELBOURNE. IT HAS


185
0:23:48,32 --> 0:23:56,91
BEEN READ BY COUNTLESS INDIVIDUALS SINCE
IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE 1700S. HE WROTE ABOUT


186
0:23:56,91 --> 0:24:4,0
THE NATURAL PHENOMENA OF HIS LOCAL AREA, INCLUDING,
FOR EXAMPLE, THE BIRDS THAT LIVED IN HIS


187
0:24:4,0 --> 0:24:11,34
LOCAL AREA. WHERE SCIENTISTS WERE BUSY STUDYING
SPECIMENS IN MUSEUMS THAT WERE


188
0:24:11,34 --> 0:24:17,46
BROUGHT INTO MUSEUMS DESCRIBING DIFFERENCES.
GILBERT WHITE WAS OUT ON THE LAWN WATCHING


189
0:24:17,46 --> 0:24:24,23
BIRDS AND DESCRIBING THEIR ACTIVITIES. AND
HE  KNEW, HE COULD DISTINGUISH CERTAIN


190
0:24:24,23 --> 0:24:31,69
SPECIES OF BIRDS BASED ON THEIR CALLS, BASED
ON THEIR TIMES OF MIGRATION THAT SCIENTISTS


191
0:24:31,69 --> 0:24:38,539
BASED ON MUSEUM SPECIMENS COULD NOT DISTINGUISH
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE THAT LIVING INFORMATION


192
0:24:38,539 --> 0:24:43,669
ABOUT THESE CREATURES. HE DOCUMENTED ALL
THESE THINGS VERY CAREFULLY, WROTE THEM DOWN


193
0:24:43,669 --> 0:24:52,83
AND MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCIENCE AS A RESULT
OF HIS PATIENT FIELD OBSERVATIONS. OR HERE


194
0:24:52,83 --> 0:25:0,559
IN AMERICA SOMEONE ALSO WHO DOESN'T GET MUCH
CREDIT FOR HIS WORK AT THE END OF HIS LIFE,


195
0:25:0,559 --> 0:25:7,169
HENRY DAVID THOREAU. YOU MAY KNOW THOREAU
AS MAN OF LETTERS, HAVING WRITTEN WALDEN,


196
0:25:7,169 --> 0:25:14,32
POLITICAL SCIENCE WITH CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. BUT THOREAU WAS ALSO


197
0:25:14,32 --> 0:25:23,33
A VERY ACCOMPLISHED NATURALIST. WORKING
IN NEW ENGLAND, HE WAS AT HARVARD. HE WASN'T


198
0:25:23,33 --> 0:25:30,63
REALLY INTERESTED IN CLASSROOM LEARNING
THOUGH. FOCUSED ON LIFE IN THE FIELD AND


199
0:25:30,63 --> 0:25:38,19
OBSERVATIONS OF ORGANISMS AND NATURAL PHENOMENA
IN THE FIELD. AND MORE AND MORE TOWARD THE


200
0:25:38,19 --> 0:25:43,53
END OF HIS LIFE, IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS
OF HIS LIFE HE WAS MAKING VERY IMPORTANT


201
0:25:43,53 --> 0:25:50,96
STRIDES IN A VERY CONCRETE ECOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
BUT HIS JOURNALS FOR THIS TIME, HE DIED


202
0:25:50,96 --> 0:25:56,5
SUDDENLY. AND HIS JOURNALS FOR THIS TIME
WEREN'T PUBLISHED, DIDN'T COME TO LIGHT UNTIL


203
0:25:56,5 --> 0:26:1,169
MAYBE 20 YEARS AGO. HE HAD NO INFLUENCE
ON THE HISTORY OF ECOLOGY, DON'T GET MY


204
0:26:1,169 --> 0:26:9,22
WRONG. BUT HE IS A GREAT EXEMPLAR OF A NATURAL
HISTORY APPROACH, OF PATIENT DESCRIPTION


205
0:26:9,22 --> 0:26:15,809
OF NATURAL PHENOMENA. HE, I WAS A GSI IN
THIS COURSE, I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT HERE,


206
0:26:15,809 --> 0:26:22,13
GOT MY DEGREE IN THIS DEPARTMENT. AND I
WAS A GSI FOR THIS COURSE. BACK THEN WE


207
0:26:22,13 --> 0:26:32,27
LEARNED THAT THOREAU COINED THE WORD ECOLOGY.
AND IN RETROSPECT, IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT


208
0:26:32,27 --> 0:26:37,799
HISTORIANS MADE THAT  MISTAKE TO ATTRIBUTE
TO THOREAU, THE COINING OF THE WORD ECOLOGY.


209
0:26:37,799 --> 0:26:41,49
BUT, IN FACT, HIS HANDWRITING WAS JUST TERRIBLE
AND A HISTORIAN


210
0:26:41,49 --> 0:26:46,98
MISTOOK THE WORD GEOLOGY IN HIS JOURNALS FOR
THE WORD ECOLOGY.


211
0:26:46,98 --> 0:26:50,669
AND QUITE QUICKLY IT MADE IT INTO THE OXFORD
DICTIONARY AND


212
0:26:50,669 --> 0:26:53,75
THEN INTO A NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW. AND
BEFORE YOU KNEW IT EVERYONE WAS SAYING,


213
0:26:53,75 --> 0:26:59,69
OH MY GOSH, THOREAU COINED THE WORD ECOLOGY.
BUT AGAIN IT WAS AN EASY MISTAKE TO MAKE BASED


214
0:26:59,69 --> 0:27:6,58
ON THOREAU'S WORK. THOREAU WAS INTERESTED
IN ALL NATURAL PHENOMENON. BUT PLANTS, HE


215
0:27:6,58 --> 0:27:13,5
WAS A VERY GOOD BOTANIST. HE WAS A VERY
KEEN OBSERVER OF PLANTS. HE WOULD FOLLOW


216
0:27:13,5 --> 0:27:20,23
PLANTS ACROSS THE SEASONS. THE ONE THAT LIVED
ON SO-AND-SO'S YARD JUST BELOW THE OAKS


217
0:27:20,23 --> 0:27:25,11
BEFORE THE FIRST HILL, HE WOULD REVISIT
A PARTICULAR PLANT OVER THE COURSE OF THE


218
0:27:25,11 --> 0:27:29,95
SEASONS TO CHECK ON IT, TO CHECK ON ITS
STATUS, TO CHECK ON IT'S STATUS IN ITS LIFE


219
0:27:29,95 --> 0:27:31,409
HISTORY,


220
0:27:31,409 --> 0:27:39,39
YOU KNOW, ITS STAGE OF GROWTH. ITS FLOWERING
TIMES. IT'S THE TIME OF ITS SETTING SEED.


221
0:27:39,39 --> 0:27:46,63
AND HE RECORDED ALL THESE THINGS IN GREAT
DETAIL. DOCUMENTED CAREFULLY THE DAYS ON WHICH


222
0:27:46,63 --> 0:27:53,94
HE WAS MAKING THE OBSERVATIONS. ANY CONTEXTUAL
INFORMATION OF RELEVANCE. AND HIS NOTES


223
0:27:53,94 --> 0:28:2,82
WERE SO GOOD THAT SCIENTISTS JUST RECENTLY
COULD GO BACK TO THEM AND LOOK AT THE FLOWERING


224
0:28:2,82 --> 0:28:8,35
TIMES OF THESE VARIOUS PLANTS IN THAT REGION
AND COMPARE THEM WITH THE FLOWERING TIMES


225
0:28:8,35 --> 0:28:14,96
OF THE SAME SPECIES OF PLANTS TODAY AND
INTERPRET THE CHANGES IN LIGHT OF CLIMATIC


226
0:28:14,96 --> 0:28:22,26
CHANGE. RELYING OR THOREAU'S CAREFUL NATURAL
HISTORY OBSERVATIONS, EXTRACTING THE DATA


227
0:28:22,26 --> 0:28:32,799
FROM THEM, AND USING IT TO PROVIDE INSIGHT
INTO THE ROLE OF CLIMATE IN STRUCTURING PLANT


228
0:28:32,799 --> 0:28:39,48
GROWTH OVER THE PAST HUNDRED YEARS OR MORE.
DATA, THERE'S THE DEFINITION OF DATA FOR


229
0:28:39,48 --> 0:28:48,33
YOU. AS YOU RECALL DATA IS THE FLORAL FORM
OF THE WORD SO TRY TO SAY DATA ARE. DATA THEY


230
0:28:48,33 --> 0:28:55,799
ARE. THE SINGULAR IS DATUM. RIGHT? WE ALL
STUMBLE ON THAT ONCE IN A WHILE. BUT THERE


231
0:28:55,799 --> 0:29:6,59
YOU GO.  THOREAU WAS READING DARWIN
BUT DARWIN WASN'T READING THOREAU. NO ONE


232
0:29:6,59 --> 0:29:15,9
WAS READING THOREAU AT THAT TIME. BUT THOREAU
READ DARWIN AND LIKED HIM QUITE A LOT. WE'VE


233
0:29:15,9 --> 0:29:21,539
ALL HEARD OF CHARLES DARWIN WHO PUBLISHED
HIS GREAT WORK ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES


234
0:29:21,539 --> 0:29:30,83
IN 1859. IN MANY WAYS DARWIN IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT QUOTE UNQUOTE ECOLOGIST OF THIS


235
0:29:30,83 --> 0:29:38,1
ERA. WE TEND TO BOW TO THE FEET OF DARWIN.
DARWIN THE GREAT IN BIOLOGY FOR HIS INSIGHTS


236
0:29:38,1 --> 0:29:44,69
INTO EVOLUTION. AND WE DO SO RIGHTLY. AN
EXTRAORDINARY BODY OF WORK. BASED ON CREATIVE


237
0:29:44,69 --> 0:29:49,76
INSIGHT AND CAREFUL STUDY AT HOME, IN THE
LAB,


238
0:29:49,76 --> 0:29:56,1
IN THE GREENHOUSE AND IN THE FIELD ON HIS
TRAVELS. DARWIN DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR


239
0:29:56,1 --> 0:30:3,74
HIS ROLE IN THE HISTORY OF ECOLOGY. THIS
COULD BE ILLUSTRATED IN MANY WAYS, AND I'M


240
0:30:3,74 --> 0:30:8,48
TAKING A VERY BROAD BRUSHSTROKE APPROACH TO
THIS HISTORY.


241
0:30:8,48 --> 0:30:15,9
THIS IS ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT DARWIN'S INTELLECTUAL
CONTRIBUTION HERE WITH HIS METAPHOR OF A


242
0:30:15,9 --> 0:30:26,98
TANGLED BANK. AND HERE'S A QUOTE THAT YOU
CAN READ ON YOUR TIME. WHERE HE REFERS TO


243
0:30:26,98 --> 0:30:33,289
THIS RICH NETWORK OF INTERACTIONS IN A TANGLED
BANK. MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT HE


244
0:30:33,289 --> 0:30:39,3
HAD IN MIND IN THIS PICTURE HERE, WHERE ALL
THE ORGANISMS ARE INTERACTING ONE WITH THE


245
0:30:39,3 --> 0:30:43,44
NEXT, THE PLANTS WITH THEIR ROOTS IN THE SOIL
WITH THE EARTH WORMS MOVING THROUGH IT AND


246
0:30:43,44 --> 0:30:49,23
AERATING THAT SOIL AND PROVIDING A MEDIUM
OF GROWTH FOR THOSE PLANTS WITH THE BIRDS


247
0:30:49,23 --> 0:30:55,75
HAWKING INSECTS OFF OF THE BRANCHES OF THOSE
PLANTS AND THEN DEFECATING AND RETURNING SOME


248
0:30:55,75 --> 0:31:0,83
NITROGEN TO THE SOIL, SOME OF WHICH MAKES
IT INTO THE WATERWAYS AND OTHERS TAKEN BACK


249
0:31:0,83 --> 0:31:11,539
UP IN THE PLANTS. THIS NETWORK OF INTERACTIONS
REALLY IS WHAT ECOLOGISTS STUDY. ECOLOGISTS


250
0:31:11,539 --> 0:31:18,35
STUDY THE INTERACTIONS OF ORGANISMS IN RELATION
TO THEIR ENVIRONMENTS. AND DARWIN DID THIS


251
0:31:18,35 --> 0:31:33,57
AS WELL AS ANYBODY. SO SOON AFTER DARWIN'S
GREAT WORK, A GERMAN NAMED ERNST HAECKEL


252
0:31:33,57 --> 0:31:40,69
COINED THE WORD ECOLOGY. HERE'S HAECKEL IN
HIS YOUNGER YEARS IN THE CANARY  ISLANDS


253
0:31:40,69 --> 0:31:47,2
WITH A FIELD ASSISTANT. WE DON'T THINK OF
HIM AS A GREAT FIELD BIOLOGIST.


254
0:31:47,2 --> 0:31:56,37
HE WAS AN ARTIST AND A THINKER. BUT HE IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR GIVING US THIS TERM. HE WAS


255
0:31:56,37 --> 0:32:4,1
A GREAT COINER OF TERMS. HE DERIVED THE
WORD ECOLOGY FROM THESE TWO ROOTS,  OIKOS


256
0:32:4,1 --> 0:32:15,39
AND LOGOS. THE STUDY OF THE HOME. WHAT DOES
HE MEAN BY HOME? OR HOUSE? WHAT DOES IT MEAN


257
0:32:15,39 --> 0:32:24,46
TO STUDY THE HOUSE? WHAT IS THE HOUSE? HABITAT.
YEAH. THE STUDY OF THE HABITAT OF ORGANISMS


258
0:32:24,46 --> 0:32:30,76
OR THE PLACE OF DWELLING, PLACE OF LIVING,
THE ENVIRONMENT OF ORGANISMS. HE DEFINED


259
0:32:30,76 --> 0:32:35,25
IT AS THE COMPREHENSIVE SCIENCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP
OF THE ORGANISM TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THAT'S


260
0:32:35,25 --> 0:32:44,659
THE DEFINITION. QUITE THE DEFINITION IN MANY
WAYS IN 1869. ONE OF HIS PAINT THERE OF


261
0:32:44,659 --> 0:32:55,679
MOSSES AND VARIOUS BRYOPHYTES, QUITE A GREAT
ARTIST. LET'S JUMP TO THE 20TH CENTURY.


262
0:32:55,679 --> 0:33:3,23
ECOLOGY IS NOT REALLY TAKING ITS ROOTS YET
AS A FORMAL SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE. THAT


263
0:33:3,23 --> 0:33:10,559
DIDN'T REALLY START HAPPENING UNTIL THE 1960S.
BUT YOU ARE STARTING TO GET IN THE '20S


264
0:33:10,559 --> 0:33:19,58
POSITIONS IN ECOLOGY AT UNIVERSITIES OR IN
GOVERNMENTAL CONTEXTS. CHARLES ELTON WAS A


265
0:33:19,58 --> 0:33:27,33
VERY CLEAR THINKING FIELD ECOLOGIST FROM
THIS EARLY PERIOD. HERE HE IS AT OXFORD.


266
0:33:27,33 --> 0:33:34,76
THERE HE IS GOING OFF ON HIS MOTOR BIKE WITH
A BUNCH OF LIVE TRAPS TO STUDY MICE, SETTING


267
0:33:34,76 --> 0:33:43,809
OFF FOR THE FIELD. HE DID VERY EXTENSIVE
WORK IN THE ARCTIC, THE FAR NORTH. AND THIS


268
0:33:43,809 --> 0:33:52,84
IS AN EXAMPLE OF A FOOD WEB HE CONSTRUCTED
BASED ON DATA COLLECTED IN THE FIELD. FOOD


269
0:33:52,84 --> 0:33:59,2
WEBS BEING A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF ECOLOGICAL
SCIENCE, THE STUDIES OF THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS


270
0:33:59,2 --> 0:34:7,36
OF ORGANISMS ON THE BASIS OF THEIR DIETARY
HABITS. AND HE OPENED ONE OF HIS MOST FAMOUS


271
0:34:7,36 --> 0:34:12,3
  BOOKS BY SAYING ECOLOGY IS A NEW NAME
FOR A VERY OLD SUBJECT. IT SIMPLY MEANS


272
0:34:12,3 --> 0:34:24,46
SCIENTIFIC NATURAL HISTORY. SCIENTIFIC, MEANING
IN THIS CONTEXT, SYSTEMATIC, MAYBE QUANTITATIVE


273
0:34:24,46 --> 0:34:37,98
BASED ON NOT ONLY DESCRIPTION BUT NUMERICAL
DESCRIPTION, QUANTIFICATION. BASING OUR


274
0:34:37,98 --> 0:34:45,75
OBSERVATIONS IN COUNTING AND NUMBERS AND MATH.
BRINGING A MORE SOPHISTICATED METHOD TO


275
0:34:45,75 --> 0:34:58,369
OUR APPROACH THAT COULD RENDER IT MORE SCIENTIFIC.
I'LL TALK MORE ABOUT GAUSE, A RUSSIAN BIOLOGIST


276
0:34:58,369 --> 0:35:7,55
LATER. BUT JUST BRING HIM IN HERE I WILL
TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS PURSUIT IS NOT ENTIRELY


277
0:35:7,55 --> 0:35:12,26
ONE OF THE FIELD BUT IT INVOLVED EXPERIMENTS
IN THE LABORATORY. THE LABORATORY IS WHERE


278
0:35:12,26 --> 0:35:18,839
EXPERIMENTS MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO ECOLOGY
IN VERY IMPORTANT WAYS. HE WAS STUDYING


279
0:35:18,839 --> 0:35:27,29
PARAMESIA, MAKING FORMAL EXPERIMENTS AND
DEEPLY INFLUENCING THE FIELD. WE'LL GET


280
0:35:27,29 --> 0:35:33,89
TO HIS IDEAS ON COMPETITIVE EXCLUSION LATER.
AND TODAY YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO DO LABORATORY


281
0:35:33,89 --> 0:35:38,98
EXPERIMENTS OR GO INTO THE FIELD. YOU COULD
MODEL SYSTEMS ON THE COMPUTER, SIMULATION


282
0:35:38,98 --> 0:35:45,65
MODELING AND MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO ECOLOGICAL
SCIENCE. BUT ECOLOGY A IS AT ITS BEST WHEN


283
0:35:45,65 --> 0:35:51,39
IT INTEGRATES THESE APPROACHES. BEST WHEN
THE MODELS ARE BASED ON EMPIRICAL DATA FROM


284
0:35:51,39 --> 0:35:59,23
THE FIELD OR FROM THE LAB. AND THESE THREE
COMPONENTS, FIELD, LAB AND THEORY REINFORCE


285
0:35:59,23 --> 0:36:6,67
AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER. SO LET'S GET INTO
MORE MODERN DEFINITIONS OF ECOLOGY AND SOME


286
0:36:6,67 --> 0:36:15,359
THAT HAVE BEEN VERY INFLUENTIAL. IN THE '60S,
AN AUSTRALIAN ECOLOGIST DEFINED ECOLOGY


287
0:36:15,359 --> 0:36:23,21
AS THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THE DISTRIBUTION
AND ABUNDANCE OF ORGANISMS. DISTRIBUTION AND


288
0:36:23,21 --> 0:36:31,25
ABUNDANCE, SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE,
THE NUMBERS, HOW  MANY ARE THERE, OR


289
0:36:31,25 --> 0:36:37,339
WHAT IS THEIR DENSITY. THE DENSITY OF ORGANISMS.
THE BIO MASS, HOW MUCH DO THEY ALL WEIGH?


290
0:36:37,339 --> 0:36:45,54
DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE. BUT THAT'S A
LITTLE STATIC. THAT'S A LITTLE NARROW AS A


291
0:36:45,54 --> 0:36:50,42
DEFINITION. IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T ENCOMPASS
THE FULL RANGE OF ECOLOGY, A LITTLE BIT


292
0:36:50,42 --> 0:36:58,32
BETTER IS A DEFINITION THAT YOU HEAR QUITE
A LOT IN AN ECOLOGY COURSE IN AN UNDERGRADUATE


293
0:36:58,32 --> 0:37:7,53
ECOLOGY COURSE. BY CHARLES KREBS. IT'S THE
SCIENTIFIC INTERACTION AND ABUNDANCE OF ORGANISMS.


294
0:37:7,53 --> 0:37:12,99
SO YOU CAN USE THAT AS A WORKING DEFINITION.
AND IF YOU WANT YOU CAN USE ONE OF THE OLDER


295
0:37:12,99 --> 0:37:18,27
DEFINITIONS THAT I'VE GIVEN YOU IF YOU WANT.
HOPEFULLY YOU'RE GETTING A BETTER SENSE OF


296
0:37:18,27 --> 0:37:26,66
WHAT ECOLOGY IS. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE
OF WHAT DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE. A DISTRIBUTION


297
0:37:26,66 --> 0:37:36,14
AND ABUNDANCE. THE CATTLE EGRET IS A FINE
LITTLE BIRD THAT USED TO LIVE ONLY IN THE


298
0:37:36,14 --> 0:37:42,5
OLD WORLD IN AFRICA. THERE'S ONE RIDING ON
THE BACK OF A WILDEBEAST OR SOMETHING. IN


299
0:37:42,5 --> 0:37:46,839
THEIR BREEDING PLUMAGE THEY HAVE THESE NICE
ORANGE YELLOW PLUMES ON THE BACK OF THEIR


300
0:37:46,839 --> 0:37:48,9
HEADS. THEY TEND TO USE BIG MAMMALS


301
0:37:48,9 --> 0:37:57,23
TO FOLLOW BIG MAMMALS AS THEY MOVE AROUND
AND THEY PICK UP INSECTS. ANYTHING THAT'S


302
0:37:57,23 --> 0:38:2,46
FLUSHED BY THE MAMMALS AS THEY WALK. AS THE
HOOVES AND FEET DISTURB  THE GROUND, GRASS


303
0:38:2,46 --> 0:38:8,2
HOPERS AND A LIZARD MIGHT GET PARTIALLY STEPPED
ON AND THE BIRD WILL GO IN AND PICK IT UP.


304
0:38:8,2 --> 0:38:12,8
IT FORMS THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE OTHER
MAMMALS. THIS WAS AN  AFRICAN BIRD, A WELL-KNOWN


305
0:38:12,8 --> 0:38:19,2
AFRICAN BIRD. IN THE 1930S A SMALL FLOCK OF
THESE GUYS FLEW ACROSS THE ATLANTIC AND


306
0:38:19,2 --> 0:38:27,16
LANDED IN SOUTH AMERICA. AN INCREDIBLE DISPERSAL
EVENT THAT WAS APPARENTLY VERY WELL DOCUMENTED.


307
0:38:27,16 --> 0:38:33,94
THE ARRIVAL OF THIS FALL FLOCK. FROM THAT
POINT OF ARRIVAL IN SOUTH AMERICA IN 1937


308
0:38:33,94 --> 0:38:41,41
THEY'VE EXPANDED THROUGHOUT THE NEW WORLD.
THINK ABOUT HOW THAT DISPERSAL EVENT EFFECTED


309
0:38:41,41 --> 0:38:49,83
THE DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF CATTLE
EGRETS. IT EFFECTED IT QUITE A LOT ACROSS


310
0:38:49,83 --> 0:38:55,58
THE  GLOBE IN TERMS OF THEIR RANGE
AND THEIR OVERALL NUMBERS ON A GLOBAL SCALE.


311
0:38:55,58 --> 0:39:4,7
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF DISTRIBUTION
AND ABUNDANCE, THAT'S AUSTRALIA AND THAT'S


312
0:39:4,7 --> 0:39:18,339
A KANGAROO. AND IT SHOWS THE LIMITS OF RANGE
OF THESE RED KANGAROOS, MACROPUS RUFUS. AND


313
0:39:18,339 --> 0:39:28,24
THE HOTTER AREAS HERE ARE THE AREAS OF GREATER
DENSITY IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF KANGAROOS


314
0:39:28,24 --> 0:39:36,82
PER SQUARE KILOMETER. AS DESCRIBED HERE.
THE LIMITS OF THE RANGE TEND TO CORRELATE


315
0:39:36,82 --> 0:39:43,63
WITH WHAT? WHO KNOWS THE LANDSCAPE THERE
A LITTLE BIT? WHAT ARE THOSE LIMITS? YEAH,


316
0:39:43,63 --> 0:39:45,18
DRY AREAS.


317
0:39:45,18 --> 0:39:49,15
THE LIMITS OF THE OCCUPIED AREAS ARE THE DRYEST.


318
0:39:49,15 --> 0:40:1,4
THOSE COASTAL AREAS ARE MUCH WETTER AND MAYBE
LESS VARIABLE IN THEIR ARIDITY. FOR SOME


319
0:40:1,4 --> 0:40:10,51
REASON, THE KANGAROOS ARE OCCUPYING PRIMARILY
THE DRYEST AREAS. THE ARID AND SEMI-ARID


320
0:40:10,51 --> 0:40:18,27
AREAS. WHY?


321
0:40:18,27 --> 0:40:23,95
I'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER WHY AFTER WATCHING
A VIDEO THAT I'LL PROVIDE FOR YOU EITHER AT


322
0:40:23,95 --> 0:40:28,25
THE END HERE TODAY OR I'LL GIVE YOU AS A
STREAM ON-LINE. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE


323
0:40:28,25 --> 0:40:38,27
TIME TO DO IT RIGHT NOW.


324
0:40:38,27 --> 0:40:49,339
ECOLOGY IS NOT ENVIRONMENTISMALISM. THE TWO
HAVE BECOME SO CLOSELY RELATED THAT IN THE


325
0:40:49,339 --> 0:40:57,42
PUBLIC'S EYE, IF YOU SAY YOU'RE AN ECOLOGIST
THEY MIGHT THINK THAT YOU ARE AN ENVIRONMENTALIST.


326
0:40:57,42 --> 0:41:1,97
AND THEY MAY BE RIGHT BECAUSE IN ECOLOGISTS
BECAUSE AS A RESULT OF THEIR STUDIES ARE


327
0:41:1,97 --> 0:41:11,14
LEAD TO INTERACTION POLITICAL CONTEXT IN TERMS
OF WANTING TO MAKE CHANGES THAT SUPPORT A


328
0:41:11,14 --> 0:41:20,98
HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT. BUT THE TWO FIELDS
ARE NOT SYNONOMOUS, THEY'RE NOT EQUIVALENT.


329
0:41:20,98 --> 0:41:27,29
ECOLOGY WE'LL SPEAK OF AS A SCIENTIFIC STUDY
OF ORGANISMS AND THEIR INTERRELATIONSHIPS.


330
0:41:27,29 --> 0:41:35,66
ENVIRONMENTALISM WE'LL THINK OF MORE AS A
  SOCIOPOLITICAL MOVEMENT TOWARD CREATING


331
0:41:35,66 --> 0:41:42,119
HEALTH AND SUSTAINING HEALTH ECOSYSTEMS.
LET'S USE RACHEL CARSON AS AN EXAMPLE OF A


332
0:41:42,119 --> 0:41:52,79
BIOLOGIST AND AN ECOLOGIST WORKING IN THE
FIELD AND STUDYING ORGANISMS, WHO WAS LEAD


333
0:41:52,79 --> 0:42:1,77
BY HER STUDIES TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE
ROLE OF PESTICIDES IN THE DECLINE OF BIRD


334
0:42:1,77 --> 0:42:10,97
POPULATIONS. PESTICIDES, PARTICULARLY DDT,
AT THIS TIME WERE CAUSING THE THINNING OF


335
0:42:10,97 --> 0:42:15,46
EGGSHELLS AS A RESULT OF GETTING INTO THE
FOOD CHAINS AND MAKING THEIR WAY INTO THE


336
0:42:15,46 --> 0:42:21,869
TISSUES OF BIRD THAT THEN LAID EGGS. THE
SHELLS OF THESE EGGS WERE THINNED TO THE POINT


337
0:42:21,869 --> 0:42:28,95
WHERE THEY WERE CRACKING AND MANY BIRDS WERE
HAVING TROUBLE SURVIVING. HER BOOK, SILENT


338
0:42:28,95 --> 0:42:34,79
SPRING, DREW ATTENTION TO THIS PHENOMENON.
AND SILENT SPRING, A REFERENCE TO JUST HOW


339
0:42:34,79 --> 0:42:41,349
QUIET IT HAD GOTTEN IN THE SPRINGS THAT
USED TO BE RICH WITH BIRD SONG. AND THIS


340
0:42:41,349 --> 0:42:47,27
WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR CATALYSTS FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL
MOVEMENT. THIS IS AN ECOLOGIST WHO CATALOGED


341
0:42:47,27 --> 0:42:53,21
SOCIOPOLITICAL ACTION AS A RESULT OF HER
SCIENTIFIC WORK. SO THEY ARE CLOSELY RELATED


342
0:42:53,21 --> 0:43:2,25
BUT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME THING. JUST FINISHING
THE DISCUSSION OF THIS EARLY PERIOD, THIS


343
0:43:2,25 --> 0:43:9,4
IMAGE ALONE IS THOUGHT BY HISTORIANS TO HAVE
BEEN ONE OF MAJOR FACTORS IN THE LAUNCHING


344
0:43:9,4 --> 0:43:17,329
OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT, WHENR HUMAN
BEINGS SAW EARTH FROM SPACE FOR THE FIRST


345
0:43:17,329 --> 0:43:26,27
TIME. A SPINNING AMD FRAGILE APPEARING BLUE
PLANET AGAINST THE DARK RECESSS OF SPACE.


346
0:43:26,27 --> 0:43:37,92
THAT IMAGE ALONE FOR MANY PEOPLE TRIGGERED
AN AWARENESS OF OUR GLOBE AS A SINGLE AND


347
0:43:37,92 --> 0:43:42,67
FRAGILE HOME. YOU GUYS HAVE HUNG IN THERE
WELL. PLEASE TRY TO COME BACK ON MONDAY.


348
0:43:42,67 --> 0:45:42,67
HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND.
