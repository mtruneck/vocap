BRAD ACKMAN: The Front Sight,
the physical complex, consists


3
0:0:13,54 --> 0:0:17,8
of 550 acres just outside
of Las Vegas.


4
0:0:17,8 --> 0:0:19,6
Wide open expanse of desert,
so we've got


5
0:0:19,6 --> 0:0:20,23
lots and lots of room.


6
0:0:20,23 --> 0:0:21,14
No encroachment--


7
0:0:21,14 --> 0:0:22,45
we're free to basically
develop this


8
0:0:22,45 --> 0:0:26,306
facility as we see fit.


9
0:0:26,306 --> 0:0:30,26
Well, Front Sight is the
creation of Dr. Ignatius


10
0:0:30,26 --> 0:0:32,78
Piazza who's the founder
and director.


11
0:0:32,78 --> 0:0:36,8
He was taking courses under Jeff
Cooper back in the '80s--


12
0:0:36,8 --> 0:0:37,38
a long time ago.


13
0:0:37,38 --> 0:0:41,36
And through the training that he
received under Jeff Cooper


14
0:0:41,36 --> 0:0:45,572
and other national instructors,
he realized that


15
0:0:45,572 --> 0:0:47,39
this was definitely
his cup of tea.


16
0:0:47,39 --> 0:0:49,83
And more importantly, that
he could do it better.


17
0:0:49,83 --> 0:0:52,89
He could reach the masses,
really spread the word.


18
0:0:52,89 --> 0:0:54,93
Spread the doctrine to those
people who needed it.


19
0:0:54,93 --> 0:1:1,78
Not just SWAT cops and special
forces military, but average,


20
0:1:1,78 --> 0:1:4,856
everyday citizens.


21
0:1:4,856 --> 0:1:7,34
MARTIN JONES: My name is
Martin Jones, and I'm


22
0:1:7,34 --> 0:1:11,24
originally from England but
I live in San Diego now.


23
0:1:11,24 --> 0:1:13,4
MALE SPEAKER: And how many times
have you been here to


24
0:1:13,4 --> 0:1:13,46
Front Side?


25
0:1:13,46 --> 0:1:14,88
MARTIN JONES: This
is my third time.


26
0:1:14,88 --> 0:1:17,6
For me, it's a case I get a
chance to actually learn


27
0:1:17,6 --> 0:1:19,5
skills that I've always
wanted to learn.


28
0:1:19,5 --> 0:1:22,235
Not so much for personal
protection, but simply because


29
0:1:22,235 --> 0:1:22,96
I enjoy shooting.


30
0:1:22,96 --> 0:1:24,55
MALE SPEAKER: Why did you want
to come to Front Side?


31
0:1:24,55 --> 0:1:25,41
TYSON MANN: Well actually,
I'm planning on


32
0:1:25,41 --> 0:1:27,5
joining the Navy SEALs.


33
0:1:27,5 --> 0:1:31,16
So I'm going to get some good
handgun training before I go


34
0:1:31,16 --> 0:1:31,97
to basic training.


35
0:1:31,97 --> 0:1:33,92
MALE SPEAKER: Get ahead of
the curve a little bit?


36
0:1:33,92 --> 0:1:34,24
TYSON MANN: Yeah.


37
0:1:34,24 --> 0:1:36,32
MALE SPEAKER: So when are
you going to go enlist?


38
0:1:36,32 --> 0:1:37,22
How does that process work?


39
0:1:37,22 --> 0:1:38,435
TYSON MANN: Actually
in three days.


40
0:1:38,435 --> 0:1:41,526
MALE SPEAKER: In three days
you're going to be signing up?


41
0:1:41,526 --> 0:1:43,65
BRAD ACKMAN: So as you can see
in the background, we have


42
0:1:43,65 --> 0:1:48,94
handgun, shotgun, rifle ranges
we also cater to M16s, Uzis,


43
0:1:48,94 --> 0:1:50,11
martial arts.


44
0:1:50,11 --> 0:1:52,5
We're standing on the rope
and repel facility.


45
0:1:52,5 --> 0:1:54,43
So it's a huge facility,
continues to


46
0:1:54,43 --> 0:1:55,83
grow all the time.


47
0:1:55,83 --> 0:1:58,35
That's really the nature
of the facility.


48
0:1:58,35 --> 0:2:2,33
The training, as I mentioned a
moment ago, is really geared


49
0:2:2,33 --> 0:2:3,47
toward the private citizen.


50
0:2:3,47 --> 0:2:6,25
Those people who want to come
out and learn defensive


51
0:2:6,25 --> 0:2:7,67
tactical skills.


52
0:2:7,67 --> 0:2:9,91
Sometimes we get the hobbyist,
kind of the weekend


53
0:2:9,91 --> 0:2:11,22
enthusiast, and that,
too, is fine.


54
0:2:11,22 --> 0:2:14,48
If this is their social outlet
and they want to channel it


55
0:2:14,48 --> 0:2:16,3
through a productive
activity, firearms


56
0:2:16,3 --> 0:2:17,9
training, that's great.


57
0:2:17,9 --> 0:2:19,7
We're happy to have those
folks as well.


58
0:2:19,7 --> 0:2:21,45
But really we're training
those people who


59
0:2:21,45 --> 0:2:22,85
want to stay alive.


60
0:2:22,85 --> 0:2:23,92

0:2:27,559 --> 0:2:28,505

65
0:2:28,505 --> 0:2:29,755
JESSE PEARSON: Thanks.


66
0:2:29,755 --> 0:2:33,235



67
0:2:33,235 --> 0:2:35,99
CRAIG BISHOP: Here on the range,
your weapon will only


68
0:2:35,99 --> 0:2:38,83
be one of three places--


69
0:2:38,83 --> 0:2:43,585
in the holster, at the ready,
or pointed at the target.


70
0:2:43,585 --> 0:2:44,39
Say again.


71
0:2:44,39 --> 0:2:48,38
Your weapon will only be
one of three places--


72
0:2:48,38 --> 0:2:51,38
in the holster, at the ready
or pointed at the target.


73
0:2:51,38 --> 0:2:57,68

Army and a lot of time in


74
0:2:57,68 --> 0:3:1,39
the National Guard in the 19th
Special Forces Group.


75
0:3:1,39 --> 0:3:6,36
Been to a lot of places and
doing a lot of Fed missions in


76
0:3:6,36 --> 0:3:9,285
foreign countries with them for
anywhere from two weeks to


77
0:3:9,285 --> 0:3:11,38
a couple months for
the most of it.


78
0:3:11,38 --> 0:3:14,25
Spent a lot of time in
Korea, Thailand.


79
0:3:14,25 --> 0:3:19,11
Right on up here to the 10.


80
0:3:19,11 --> 0:3:22,835

0:3:37,7 --> 0:3:38,46
A, B, C or D?


87
0:3:38,46 --> 0:3:41,5
TONY: Oh, I'd give you a
B, that's a strong B.


88
0:3:41,5 --> 0:3:56,88
JESSE PEARSON: For
effort I get a B.


89
0:3:56,88 --> 0:3:58,528
CRAIG BISHOP: If you're
not here, you're late.


90
0:3:58,528 --> 0:4:1,456
We're starting anyway,
right now.


91
0:4:1,456 --> 0:4:4,55
Finger off the trigger.


92
0:4:4,55 --> 0:4:7,83
Let him know that, I shouldn't
have to come up and tell him.


93

Yell at him.

JESSE PEARSON: Tony?


99
0:4:23,2 --> 0:4:23,93
Tony's good, man.


100
0:4:23,93 --> 0:4:25,74
He's very encouraging.


101
0:4:25,74 --> 0:4:29,33
He keeps saying you can do it,
you're going to get it.


102
0:4:29,33 --> 0:4:31,66
He told that lady next
to me not to quit


103
0:4:31,66 --> 0:4:32,31
because she was bummed.


104
0:4:32,31 --> 0:4:34,24
He said don't give up.


105
0:4:34,24 --> 0:4:37,97
He's a man of few words, but
they're well-chosen words.

[GUNSHOTS]


108
0:4:43,66 --> 0:4:46,798
CRAIG BISHOP: You need
to stay alive.


109
0:4:46,798 --> 0:4:51,385
You need to train the way
you want to fight.


110
0:4:51,385 --> 0:4:55,48
Because when you get in
a fight, you will


111
0:4:55,48 --> 0:4:58,63
fight the way you train.


112
0:4:58,63 --> 0:5:2,0
You will not rise
to the occasion.


113
0:5:2,0 --> 0:5:5,87
You will sink to your
level of training.


114
0:5:5,87 --> 0:5:9,95
So make that level of training
as high and as good and


115
0:5:9,95 --> 0:5:14,1
realistic as you can,
because that is what


116
0:5:14,1 --> 0:5:15,5
will keep you alive.

0:5:15,5 --> 0:5:16,75

I think it would've stopped
him, probably.

I don't know if it meets muster
here, but it probably


129

would have stopped him.

saw any combat.


134
0:5:59,29 --> 0:6:2,25
Probably one the best trained
guys that never was in combat.


135
0:6:2,25 --> 0:6:5,73
I probably would have, but I
was in Coronado, I was on a


136
0:6:5,73 --> 0:6:7,66
combat dive team.


137
0:6:7,66 --> 0:6:12,61
And prior to 9/11, I was there
on a training operation and


138
0:6:12,61 --> 0:6:15,79
shattered the arm and shoulder
in a rubber raft.


139
0:6:15,79 --> 0:6:19,28
So I was what we refer
to as "broke dick."

Go in to the hospital broken
up, 9/11 happened.

all my buddies ended up in

on not being there?


150
0:6:42,54 --> 0:6:45,46

that long training and then


151
0:6:45,46 --> 0:6:48,8
something happens and everybody
else you trained


152
0:6:48,8 --> 0:6:51,95

and you're not.

158

in America today?


159
0:7:6,703 --> 0:7:9,35
MARTIN JONES: Being British, I
don't know too much about the


160
0:7:9,35 --> 0:7:10,37
Second Amendment.


161
0:7:10,37 --> 0:7:15,46
But I do know it allows you to
use and carry guns in the US.


162
0:7:15,46 --> 0:7:18,46
In Britain, you're not allowed
to anymore and I


163
0:7:18,46 --> 0:7:19,7
think that's very sad.


164
0:7:19,7 --> 0:7:22,85
TYSON MANN: They are really
starting to take away our gun


165
0:7:22,85 --> 0:7:25,8
rights that are in the
Constitution which all of our


166
0:7:25,8 --> 0:7:27,56
laws are supposed to
be based upon.


167
0:7:27,56 --> 0:7:29,27
So that really makes me angry.


168
0:7:29,27 --> 0:7:32,21
CRAIG BISHOP: I would say that
if you really look at it, our


169
0:7:32,21 --> 0:7:35,44
whole Constitution
is in tatters.


170
0:7:35,44 --> 0:7:39,55
We are supposed to be the most
free country in the world.


171
0:7:39,55 --> 0:7:42,55
If you look at it, there's
hardly anything we can do


172
0:7:42,55 --> 0:7:45,8
without buying some kind of a
license, getting government


173
0:7:45,8 --> 0:7:46,28
permission.

TONY LAZADA: I hope it doesn't
come to the point wherein the


175

law abiding citizens will just
say forget everything, there's


176
0:7:55,34 --> 0:8:0,3
too much bureaucracy red tape.


177
0:8:0,3 --> 0:8:1,595
That won't be a good deal.


178
0:8:1,595 --> 0:8:3,43

have to follow what the


179

people in the community
want them to be.


180
0:8:5,13 --> 0:8:7,44

181
0:8:7,44 --> 0:8:9,74
about weapons, about guns.

are made based on these

becoming more programmed or

0:8:56,81 --> 0:8:58,4
Is that freedom?


204
0:8:58,4 --> 0:9:4,46
FRANK PATTERSON: A free
society is one where


205
0:9:4,46 --> 0:9:5,88
everybody's rights
are respected.


206
0:9:5,88 --> 0:9:8,44



207
0:9:8,44 --> 0:9:11,22
But the government isn't
respecting our rights when


208
0:9:11,22 --> 0:9:12,74
they keep taking them
away from us.


209
0:9:12,74 --> 0:9:31,772



210
0:9:31,772 --> 0:9:33,861
JESSE PEARSON: Anybody
gone through yet?


211
0:9:33,861 --> 0:9:34,91
ALEX HARPER: No, we're actually


212
0:9:34,91 --> 0:9:36,9
using you as a target.


213
0:9:36,9 --> 0:9:39,472
JESSE PEARSON: OK, I'll
be firing, too.


214
0:9:39,472 --> 0:9:41,49
ALEX HARPER: Well, that's good
because you'll be pointed down


215
0:9:41,49 --> 0:9:44,836
range as will I. So that'll be
in a universal position.


216
0:9:44,836 --> 0:9:45,6
JESSE PEARSON: Nice.


217
0:9:45,6 --> 0:9:46,69
MALE SPEAKER: Say that again?


218
0:9:46,69 --> 0:9:48,86
TREVOR LATHAM: The hostage drill
is a live puppy, and if


219
0:9:48,86 --> 0:9:50,46
you miss you kill the puppy.


220
0:9:50,46 --> 0:9:52,48
So, little guy got it.


221
0:9:52,48 --> 0:9:53,44
Poor little guy.


222
0:9:53,44 --> 0:9:54,4
MALE SPEAKER: It's all
for the greater good.


223
0:9:54,4 --> 0:9:55,84
-They got a puppy as well.


224
0:9:55,84 --> 0:9:58,75
MALE SPEAKER: I think I
heard him say stop or


225
0:9:58,75 --> 0:10:0,0
I'll kill this bitch.


226
0:10:0,0 --> 0:10:4,39



227
0:10:4,39 --> 0:10:6,18
KEN GILLETT: Situation is
you're sitting at home


228
0:10:6,18 --> 0:10:8,275
relaxing, somebody starts
beating on your door.


229
0:10:8,275 --> 0:10:9,854
[POUNDING ON DOOR]


230
0:10:9,854 --> 0:10:12,26
Where's my drugs,
motherfucker?


231
0:10:12,26 --> 0:10:13,745
Here I come!


232
0:10:13,745 --> 0:10:17,21
[GUNSHOTS]


233
0:10:17,21 --> 0:10:19,685
Hey buddy, you need any help?


234
0:10:19,685 --> 0:10:21,665
You shot my friend!


235
0:10:21,665 --> 0:10:22,16
Ahh!


236
0:10:22,16 --> 0:10:26,12
[GUNSHOTS]


237
0:10:26,12 --> 0:10:27,605
You missed me!


238
0:10:27,605 --> 0:10:29,9
[GUNSHOTS]


239
0:10:29,9 --> 0:10:32,555



240
0:10:32,555 --> 0:10:34,4
Here I come!


241
0:10:34,4 --> 0:10:37,505
[GUNSHOTS]


242
0:10:37,505 --> 0:10:39,485
Drop the gun, I'm going
to kill this bitch!


243
0:10:39,485 --> 0:10:41,0
[GUNSHOTS]


244
0:10:41,0 --> 0:10:44,566
And scenario's over, back
to the holster.


245
0:10:44,566 --> 0:10:48,15
JESSE PEARSON: That ruled.


246
0:10:48,15 --> 0:10:51,45
KEN GILLETT: And this guy, he's
beating on your door,


247
0:10:51,45 --> 0:10:51,84
where's my drugs.


248
0:10:51,84 --> 0:10:54,27
You kind of went for the gun,
but you weren't sure whether


249
0:10:54,27 --> 0:10:55,405
it should come out
of the holster.


250
0:10:55,405 --> 0:10:57,11
You're in your home, somebody's
beating on your


251
0:10:57,11 --> 0:10:59,94
door-- unless you sell
drugs, I don't know.


252
0:10:59,94 --> 0:11:1,78
Somebody's beating on your
door, where's my drugs.


253
0:11:1,78 --> 0:11:2,96
Gun comes out to ready.


254
0:11:2,96 --> 0:11:6,34
You want to be ready for this
guy to kick your door in.


255
0:11:6,34 --> 0:11:9,786
You came up, two shots, control
pair right to the


256
0:11:9,786 --> 0:11:12,62
nose, excellent shooting.


257
0:11:12,62 --> 0:11:14,74
Standard response we'd like
to see is to the chest.


258
0:11:14,74 --> 0:11:15,62
JESSE PEARSON: The
thoracic first.


259
0:11:15,62 --> 0:11:18,46
KEN GILLETT: Again, designated
head shots do come into play.


260
0:11:18,46 --> 0:11:20,982
I'm not saying that it's wrong,
but what we'd like to


261
0:11:20,982 --> 0:11:22,92
see is controlled pair
to the chest first.


262
0:11:22,92 --> 0:11:24,88
That's a good shot,
that's in the box.


263
0:11:24,88 --> 0:11:26,91
That round is a problem.


264
0:11:26,91 --> 0:11:29,92
That is now what we call a "to
whom it may concern" round.


265
0:11:29,92 --> 0:11:32,41
That round is headed off
who knows where.


266
0:11:32,41 --> 0:11:35,13
That could hit grandma coming
up the street from the store


267
0:11:35,13 --> 0:11:35,9
with her groceries.


268
0:11:35,9 --> 0:11:38,34
It could hit the baby in the
stroller or the kid at the


269
0:11:38,34 --> 0:11:40,27
park, who knows.


270
0:11:40,27 --> 0:11:42,2
Make sure you're seeing your
sights and they're getting


271
0:11:42,2 --> 0:11:42,82
where they need to be.


272
0:11:42,82 --> 0:11:45,71
Again, we'd like to see
two to the thoracic.


273
0:11:45,71 --> 0:11:46,87
You did not shoot the
guy with the phone.


274
0:11:46,87 --> 0:11:47,375
Why?


275
0:11:47,375 --> 0:11:49,675
JESSE PEARSON: Because he was
there to try and help me.


276
0:11:49,675 --> 0:11:53,185
Not a threatening position, not
saying anything that was--


277
0:11:53,185 --> 0:11:54,985
KEN GILLETT: Had he said I'm
going to beat you over the


278
0:11:54,985 --> 0:11:56,49
head with this phone,
what would you do?


279
0:11:56,49 --> 0:11:58,375
JESSE PEARSON: I would've
said stop or I'll shoot.


280
0:11:58,375 --> 0:12:0,6
KEN GILLETT: Had he raised
it overhead and


281
0:12:0,6 --> 0:12:1,5
advanced toward you?


282
0:12:1,5 --> 0:12:2,85
JESSE PEARSON: Two
in the thoracic.


283
0:12:2,85 --> 0:12:3,3
KEN GILLETT: Good.


284
0:12:3,3 --> 0:12:4,61
That's the exact response
we're looking for.


285
0:12:4,61 --> 0:12:5,47
JESSE PEARSON: OK, great.


286
0:12:5,47 --> 0:12:8,87
KEN GILLETT: The first one's a
little low, still in the box.


287
0:12:8,87 --> 0:12:12,49
Your second one, however,
couldn't be any more centered


288
0:12:12,49 --> 0:12:13,6
in the box.


289
0:12:13,6 --> 0:12:15,36
Right there on the bridge of the
nose is at dead center of


290
0:12:15,36 --> 0:12:17,6
the box, it's exactly what
we're looking for.


291
0:12:17,6 --> 0:12:17,14
JESSE PEARSON: Excellent.


292
0:12:17,14 --> 0:12:18,91
KEN GILLETT: Excellent job
on the hostage shot.


293
0:12:18,91 --> 0:12:19,71
JESSE PEARSON: Thanks
very much.


294
0:12:19,71 --> 0:12:22,415
CRAIG BISHOP: In the dark
it's hard for us


295
0:12:22,415 --> 0:12:24,85
to clearly see everybody.


296
0:12:24,85 --> 0:12:27,51
So we're going to need your help
a lot in maintaining a


297
0:12:27,51 --> 0:12:28,97
safe range.


298
0:12:28,97 --> 0:12:32,9
My finger does not go on the
trigger until I've identified


299
0:12:32,9 --> 0:12:37,17
positively that that's a target
that I want to shoot.


300
0:12:37,17 --> 0:12:39,94
In your house you may
hear the noise,


301
0:12:39,94 --> 0:12:41,392
you're doing the search.


302
0:12:41,392 --> 0:12:42,83
Your finger's on the trigger.


303
0:12:42,83 --> 0:12:45,27
The room's too light
and you come up--


304
0:12:45,27 --> 0:12:47,62
that's the kid sneaking home
through the window.


305
0:12:47,62 --> 0:12:51,388



306
0:12:51,388 --> 0:12:53,976
JESSE PEARSON: I think this is
probably the most excited I've


307
0:12:53,976 --> 0:12:55,332
been the whole time
we've been here.


308
0:12:55,332 --> 0:12:56,811
I can't wait to shoot this.


309
0:12:56,811 --> 0:12:58,43
CRAIG BISHOP: Remember,
we do not start


310
0:12:58,43 --> 0:13:0,262
until the go command.


311
0:13:0,262 --> 0:13:2,86
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] and
then the gun starts flipping.


312
0:13:2,86 --> 0:13:4,985
Maximize the contacts to the
back of [INAUDIBLE].


313
0:13:4,985 --> 0:13:9,7
[GUNSHOTS]


314
0:13:9,7 --> 0:13:12,87



315
0:13:12,87 --> 0:13:13,85
MALE SPEAKER: How'd you do?


316
0:13:13,85 --> 0:13:14,34
JESSE PEARSON: Can you
light me up, Mike?


317
0:13:14,34 --> 0:13:16,125
I don't know, we're about to
find out, moment of truth.


318
0:13:16,125 --> 0:13:17,35
Oh, I'm low a lot.


319
0:13:17,35 --> 0:13:19,4
Oh, not bad, actualy.


320
0:13:19,4 --> 0:13:21,873
Better than I fucking
do in the daylight.


321
0:13:21,873 --> 0:13:23,837
I'm meant to shoot at night.


322
0:13:23,837 --> 0:13:27,274
I'm not meant to shoot
in the daytime.


323
0:13:27,274 --> 0:13:29,67
I'm meant to shoot when
everybody else is asleep.


324
0:13:29,67 --> 0:13:31,891
CRAIG BISHOP: Ready!


325
0:13:31,891 --> 0:13:37,862
[GUNSHOTS]


326
0:13:37,862 --> 0:13:38,806
JESSE PEARSON: Oh!


327
0:13:38,806 --> 0:13:40,694
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, those aren't
head shots, dude.


328
0:13:40,694 --> 0:13:41,638
JESSE PEARSON: This
is fucked up.


329
0:13:41,638 --> 0:13:43,27
MALE SPEAKER: How'd
you do this time?


330
0:13:43,27 --> 0:13:44,43
JESSE PEARSON: Not very well.


331
0:13:44,43 --> 0:13:45,69
MALE SPEAKER: Think
he's dead, man.


332
0:13:45,69 --> 0:13:48,39
JESSE PEARSON: Well, the thorax
I still got a bunch.


333
0:13:48,39 --> 0:13:50,85
MALE SPEAKER: Tell you what, why
don't you take this one?


334
0:13:50,85 --> 0:13:53,32
JESSE PEARSON: All
right, all right.


335
0:13:53,32 --> 0:13:56,284
Maybe I'm better at shooting
never in the daytime


336
0:13:56,284 --> 0:13:59,248
[INAUDIBLE].

338
0:14:6,164 --> 0:14:7,83
MALE SPEAKER: How'd you
do this time, Jesse?


339
0:14:7,83 --> 0:14:9,324
JESSE PEARSON: I
don't know man.


340
0:14:9,324 --> 0:14:11,316
Just get that camera and
shove it up your ass.

0:14:16,11 --> 0:14:18,45

thing I'm doing was doing in


343
0:14:18,45 --> 0:14:19,19
the military.

0:14:19,19 --> 0:14:23,12

skills to stay alive if they


345

need to do it.
