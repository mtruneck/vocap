interesting about your career

to me is that you're almost more
accomplished as, I mean


49
0:1:44,2 --> 0:1:45,93
you're definitely more
accomplished as a writer than

someone who's in front
of the camera.


51
0:1:48,1 --> 0:1:50,71
Was it inevitable that you
would go into writing?


52
0:1:50,71 --> 0:1:52,38
JON GLASER: I never thought
I would, honestly.


53
0:1:52,38 --> 0:1:55,44
I love David Rakoff's book Fraud
just because that's how


54
0:1:55,44 --> 0:1:56,79
I've always envisioned myself.


55
0:1:56,79 --> 0:1:58,4
I'm not a writer.


56
0:1:58,4 --> 0:2:0,2
And I still don't feel
like I necessarily am


57
0:2:0,2 --> 0:2:1,69
even though I do.


58
0:2:1,69 --> 0:2:4,9
But it's not something I
envision doing at all.


59
0:2:4,9 --> 0:2:6,68
And even when I got The Dana
Carvey Show job I felt like,


60
0:2:6,68 --> 0:2:7,98
this will be cool for
now and I'm still


61
0:2:7,98 --> 0:2:10,46
going to pursue acting.


62
0:2:10,46 --> 0:2:12,74
But it's the greatest thing
that ever happened to me,


63
0:2:12,74 --> 0:2:14,84
getting that job and opening
up a whole other


64
0:2:14,84 --> 0:2:17,23
world of just jobs.

even a first career.

0:2:20,42 --> 0:2:23,86
But I still feel like I'm an
actor, a better actor than I


67
0:2:23,86 --> 0:2:26,81
am a writer but I
love doing both.


68
0:2:26,81 --> 0:2:30,43
And especially jobs where I can
do both, like Conan, or my

kind of the dream

72
0:2:33,78 --> 0:2:35,95

the dream job, at

0:2:35,95 --> 0:2:36,96
least at the time.


74
0:2:36,96 --> 0:2:40,43
Doing Delocated is the ultimate,
but Conan was really


75
0:2:40,43 --> 0:2:41,83
just the best job.

and perform and do your


79
0:2:48,1 --> 0:2:49,21
own stuff or not.


80
0:2:49,21 --> 0:2:51,85
To also not perform was great.

for another

doing all the sketchy bits and

it was awesome.

0:5:40,514 --> 0:5:44,17
Where did the idea come from
for the character?


182
0:5:44,17 --> 0:5:48,34
JON GLASER: The original idea,
I had done an incarnation of


183
0:5:48,34 --> 0:5:52,52
this character, before I got
hired at Conan, which is an


184
0:5:52,52 --> 0:5:55,59
impressionist who is in the
witness protection program,


185
0:5:55,59 --> 0:5:57,74
who really still wanted to
perform and get himself out


186
0:5:57,74 --> 0:6:0,22
there so he wore a ski mask
and altered his voice.


187
0:6:0,22 --> 0:6:1,5
And the joke was that
the impressions


188
0:6:1,5 --> 0:6:2,41
all sounded the same.


189
0:6:2,41 --> 0:6:3,63
It was that stupid voice.


190
0:6:3,63 --> 0:6:5,17
You know, when you hear someone
on the news doing a


191
0:6:5,17 --> 0:6:6,49

as dumb as can be.

THOBEY CAMPION (OFFSCREEN): You
know, the other thing that


209
0:6:33,44 --> 0:6:36,52
struck me right off the bat, was
you've essentially limited


210
0:6:36,52 --> 0:6:41,85
your vocal and facial range to
your eyes and mouth and a very


211
0:6:41,85 --> 0:6:44,28
small spectrum of vocal
inflection.


212
0:6:44,28 --> 0:6:47,53
JON GLASER: Basically, I think
the key to it actually is the


213
0:6:47,53 --> 0:6:48,65
mask we have.


214
0:6:48,65 --> 0:6:50,64
Because the eye holes
are really big, as


215
0:6:50,64 --> 0:6:51,78
is the mouth hole.


216
0:6:51,78 --> 0:6:54,84
So I still feel like you get a
sense of a face and you do get


217
0:6:54,84 --> 0:6:58,1
a sense of expression with
the eyes and the mouth.


218
0:6:58,1 --> 0:6:59,82
So I don't think you
lose too much.


219
0:6:59,82 --> 0:7:2,43
And for me it was never
an issue, like the ski


220
0:7:2,43 --> 0:7:3,34
mask and the voice.


221
0:7:3,34 --> 0:7:6,38
I always looked at it as, this
is just how he looks and this


222
0:7:6,38 --> 0:7:7,14
is how he talks.


223
0:7:7,14 --> 0:7:8,19
Like that's his face.


224
0:7:8,19 --> 0:7:9,69
That's his voice.


225
0:7:9,69 --> 0:7:12,68
THOBEY CAMPION: And what's in
store for season three?


226
0:7:12,68 --> 0:7:16,72
JON GLASER: My character just
decides to play pro-ball.


227
0:7:16,72 --> 0:7:21,17
And he dedicates himself to
trying out for teams, working


228
0:7:21,17 --> 0:7:24,6
on his dunks, shoots about
1,000 free throws a day.


229

if you like the art of


230

Which I think is hilarious
considering the main

0:8:50,627 --> 0:8:52,9
character--


288
0:8:52,9 --> 0:8:53,71
they're calling it accessible
and the main character is

traditional sitcom as far

as accessibility goes.


292
0:8:59,39 --> 0:9:2,7
And it's 30 minutes also, which
allows it to be a little

more expanded and breathe a
little bit as opposed to the

0:9:4,3 --> 0:9:7,11

predominantly, which are just

shorter, faster, and tighter,
