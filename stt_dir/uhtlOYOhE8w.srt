1
0:0:1,7 --> 0:0:2,567
Audience Members:
Hey!


2
0:0:2,567 --> 0:0:3,467
Todd Park:
How is everybody doing?


3
0:0:3,467 --> 0:0:4,567
Audience Members:
Whooo!


4
0:0:4,567 --> 0:0:5,867
Todd Park:
Fantastic!


5
0:0:5,867 --> 0:0:6,734
I'm Todd Park,


6
0:0:6,734 --> 0:0:10,3
U.S. Chief Technology Officer
here with my brother,


7
0:0:10,3 --> 0:0:12,8
Steve Van Roekel, U.S.
Chief Information Officer.


8
0:0:12,8 --> 0:0:13,867
[laughter]


9
0:0:13,867 --> 0:0:15,533
And it is our
great pleasure to welcome


10
0:0:15,533 --> 0:0:19,1
you here today both those
here in person and those


11
0:0:19,1 --> 0:0:21,66
watching on live stream.


12
0:0:21,66 --> 0:0:22,2
Today we've all come
together to celebrate the


13
0:0:22,2 --> 0:0:25,567
Launch of the Presidential
Innovation Fellows


14
0:0:25,567 --> 0:0:29,467
Program, a new initiative
that is bringing 18


15
0:0:29,467 --> 0:0:31,834
incredibly talented
private sector innovators


16
0:0:31,834 --> 0:0:35,333
from across America to
D.C. to work with our best


17
0:0:35,333 --> 0:0:39,567
innovators for six months
on five high-impact projects.


18
0:0:39,567 --> 0:0:41,5
These projects promise to
support entrepreneurs,


19
0:0:41,5 --> 0:0:44,33
small businesses, job
growth and the economy


20
0:0:44,33 --> 0:0:46,667
while also significantly
improving the ability of


21
0:0:46,667 --> 0:0:49,5
the federal government to
serve the American people.


22
0:0:49,5 --> 0:0:50,934
Today you will learn more
about these five important


23
0:0:50,934 --> 0:0:55,133
projects and meet the 18
extraordinary Americans,


24
0:0:55,133 --> 0:0:57,767
our Inaugural Presidential
Innovation Fellows who've


25
0:0:57,767 --> 0:0:59,8
agreed to drop everything,
come to D.C. in the middle


26
0:0:59,8 --> 0:1:2,266
of summer, work incredibly
hard to do great things


27
0:1:2,266 --> 0:1:3,767
for the American people.


28
0:1:3,767 --> 0:1:5,3
And you can follow the
conversation on twitter,


29
0:1:5,3 --> 0:1:9,734
contribute to the
conversation at #innovategov.


30
0:1:9,734 --> 0:1:11,433
Steven Van Roekel:
So three months ago today


31
0:1:11,433 --> 0:1:12,166
Todd and I
launched the U.S.


32
0:1:12,166 --> 0:1:15,9
Digital Government
Strategy which is a


33
0:1:15,9 --> 0:1:18,7
groundbreaking plan to
unleash the power of


34
0:1:18,7 --> 0:1:22,4
innovation and technology
within government.


35
0:1:22,4 --> 0:1:25,633
The goals of the digital
strategy were sort
of three-fold.


36
0:1:25,633 --> 0:1:29,266
One was one to just have
great impact, to focus on


37
0:1:29,266 --> 0:1:31,533
impact, and driving
impact across government.


38
0:1:31,533 --> 0:1:33,533
Two was saving
taxpayer money.


39
0:1:33,533 --> 0:1:36,0
We think we can do things
better, faster and cheaper


40
0:1:36,0 --> 0:1:37,834
by unleashing innovation.


41
0:1:37,834 --> 0:1:40,734
And three was delivering
government in a very


42
0:1:40,734 --> 0:1:42,633
citizen-centric way.


43
0:1:42,633 --> 0:1:45,166
Now given all of this
we've made incredible


44
0:1:45,166 --> 0:1:47,4
progress the last
three months.


45
0:1:47,4 --> 0:1:49,7
Today we are proud to
announce a few things.


46
0:1:49,7 --> 0:1:52,33
One is the release of
"Bring Your Own Device


47
0:1:52,33 --> 0:1:55,166
Toolkit for government" so
teaching agencies how to


48
0:1:55,166 --> 0:1:58,2
use the resources to bear
to allow employees to


49
0:1:58,2 --> 0:2:1,633
bring devices to work and
utilize new technology


50
0:2:1,633 --> 0:2:3,333
within the boundaries
of government.


51
0:2:3,333 --> 0:2:5,734
The second, and the census
team is here from the


52
0:2:5,734 --> 0:2:8,7
Commerce Department, and
today we are very proud to


53
0:2:8,7 --> 0:2:11,633
announce the launch of
their new multi-platform


54
0:2:11,633 --> 0:2:14,166
mobile app that actually
triangulates census data


55
0:2:14,166 --> 0:2:16,967
with economic data in
really interesting ways.


56
0:2:16,967 --> 0:2:19,633
So I encourage all of you
to go and check that out.


57
0:2:19,633 --> 0:2:22,4
But one thing Todd and
I really realized going


58
0:2:22,4 --> 0:2:25,3
through this process was,
you know, just releasing


59
0:2:25,3 --> 0:2:28,2
toolkits, just unleashing
technology wasn't enough.


60
0:2:28,2 --> 0:2:30,467
We needed to bring to bear
the power of people within


61
0:2:30,467 --> 0:2:34,233
government and that is
what today is really all about.


62
0:2:34,233 --> 0:2:36,9
So based on programs like
our Entrepreneurs and


63
0:2:36,9 --> 0:2:39,333
Residents Program we ran
at the FDA and other


64
0:2:39,333 --> 0:2:42,467
places, and I believe the
team is here from there as


65
0:2:42,467 --> 0:2:45,2
well, and programs like
Code for America,


66
0:2:45,2 --> 0:2:46,233
a civic program --


67
0:2:46,233 --> 0:2:46,867
Todd Park:
Whahoo!


68
0:2:46,867 --> 0:2:47,8
Steve Van Roekel:
-- based on the West Coast,


69
0:2:47,8 --> 0:2:51,66
you know, we, Todd and I,
on May 23rd, announced the


70
0:2:51,66 --> 0:2:53,533
Presidential Innovation
Fellows Program which as


71
0:2:53,533 --> 0:2:55,6
Todd mentioned was a
program that called on


72
0:2:55,6 --> 0:2:57,934
entrepreneurs from around
America to come to


73
0:2:57,934 --> 0:3:0,9
Washington, to pick up
their lives, to move, in


74
0:3:0,9 --> 0:3:3,567
many cases, across the
continent to come work in


75
0:3:3,567 --> 0:3:7,233
government for a fixed
period of time on these


76
0:3:7,233 --> 0:3:9,333
focused innovation
projects.


77
0:3:9,333 --> 0:3:11,667
Within three weeks of
announcing the innovation


78
0:3:11,667 --> 0:3:16,2
program, we had over
700 people apply for


79
0:3:16,2 --> 0:3:19,33
18 positions within
government and thousands


80
0:3:19,33 --> 0:3:23,967
more had signed up to be
followers and follow along


81
0:3:23,967 --> 0:3:26,467
and work with us as
we moved forward.


82
0:3:26,467 --> 0:3:28,367
You'll meet the 18 today.


83
0:3:28,367 --> 0:3:29,8
We're very
excited about it.


84
0:3:29,8 --> 0:3:32,33
And then hear more about
the projects that all of


85
0:3:32,33 --> 0:3:35,133
the innovators are
going to innovate on.


86
0:3:35,133 --> 0:3:37,967
Todd Park:
And we were
just so, so incredibly


87
0:3:37,967 --> 0:3:41,4
delighted at the
outpouring from folks who


88
0:3:41,4 --> 0:3:43,734
wanted to come and serve,
who wanted to help the


89
0:3:43,734 --> 0:3:46,367
projects, it was
just an explosion of


90
0:3:46,367 --> 0:3:49,367
civic-mindedness, of a
desire to serve country,


91
0:3:49,367 --> 0:3:51,533
you know, a dedication
to the nation's future.


92
0:3:51,533 --> 0:3:53,4
And it was an incredibly
difficult task as you take


93
0:3:53,4 --> 0:3:56,233
the 700 applicants, who
were amazing, and somehow


94
0:3:56,233 --> 0:4:0,266
boil them down to just 18
folks that would actually


95
0:4:0,266 --> 0:4:2,166
come to D.C.
to be fellows.


96
0:4:2,166 --> 0:4:3,433
Many reviewers actually
told us in all their


97
0:4:3,433 --> 0:4:5,533
careers in government
they had never seen an


98
0:4:5,533 --> 0:4:9,133
applicant pool quite
like the 700 before.


99
0:4:9,133 --> 0:4:11,133
In the end the agency
did actually select 18


100
0:4:11,133 --> 0:4:12,9
extraordinary Americans
to serve as inaugural


101
0:4:12,9 --> 0:4:15,3
fellows, fellows who
embody the spirit of


102
0:4:15,3 --> 0:4:18,33
American innovation,
American entrepreneurship,


103
0:4:18,33 --> 0:4:20,166
and could can be the best
ideas from the private


104
0:4:20,166 --> 0:4:23,1
sector from across the
nation to bear on the


105
0:4:23,1 --> 0:4:25,4
critical task of building
an ever more effective and


106
0:4:25,4 --> 0:4:27,467
efficient government.


107
0:4:27,467 --> 0:4:29,166
To say a few words about
the critical importance of


108
0:4:29,166 --> 0:4:31,66
this work, it's my great
pleasure to welcome to the


109
0:4:31,66 --> 0:4:33,767
stage Jeff Zients, the
Acting Director of the


110
0:4:33,767 --> 0:4:36,133
Office of Management and
Budget and Champion of


111
0:4:36,133 --> 0:4:38,934
Innovation on
Awesomeness in general!


112
0:4:38,934 --> 0:4:39,467
Please welcome Jeff!


113
0:4:39,467 --> 0:4:44,734
[applause]


114
0:4:44,734 --> 0:4:47,5
Jeff Zients:
That's a -- can you hear me?


115
0:4:47,5 --> 0:4:48,467
Good morning, everybody.


116
0:4:48,467 --> 0:4:50,967
That's a tough act to
follow, Todd and Steve.


117
0:4:50,967 --> 0:4:54,2
And I see Steve Case
here in the front row.


118
0:4:54,2 --> 0:4:56,33
Steve's daughter Katie
and my daughter


119
0:4:56,33 --> 0:4:58,1
go to school together.


120
0:4:58,1 --> 0:5:1,3
And my daughter -- they're
both 17 so you can imagine


121
0:5:1,3 --> 0:5:2,533
what we're dealing with.


122
0:5:2,533 --> 0:5:3,166
[laughter]


123
0:5:3,166 --> 0:5:5,166
-- but she
frequently, she frequently


124
0:5:5,166 --> 0:5:9,734
reminds me "you're no
Steve Case," as I struggle


125
0:5:9,734 --> 0:5:11,8
with my technology.


126
0:5:11,8 --> 0:5:14,834
But speaking of
technology, having spent


127
0:5:14,834 --> 0:5:17,66
all of my time before
three years ago in the


128
0:5:17,66 --> 0:5:20,433
private sector, so 20 odd
years, I know firsthand


129
0:5:20,433 --> 0:5:22,867
how important technology
has been to driving the


130
0:5:22,867 --> 0:5:25,4
success of the private
sector and our overall


131
0:5:25,4 --> 0:5:27,0
global competitiveness.


132
0:5:27,0 --> 0:5:29,5
The President has been
onto this since the


133
0:5:29,5 --> 0:5:31,633
beginning when he
appointed for the first


134
0:5:31,633 --> 0:5:34,6
time ever a Chief
Technology Officer and a


135
0:5:34,6 --> 0:5:36,967
Chief Information Officer.


136
0:5:36,967 --> 0:5:39,33
So right from the
beginning the President


137
0:5:39,33 --> 0:5:40,767
has recognized the
importance of technology


138
0:5:40,767 --> 0:5:42,934
for our economy, our
global competitiveness,


139
0:5:42,934 --> 0:5:45,367
and for our government
operations.


140
0:5:45,367 --> 0:5:49,467
If you think about
productivity and the


141
0:5:49,467 --> 0:5:51,834
productivity increases,
the year over year


142
0:5:51,834 --> 0:5:54,3
increases in the private
sector, 1 1/2 to 2%


143
0:5:54,3 --> 0:5:56,834
increase for the last
couple of decades in


144
0:5:56,834 --> 0:5:59,867
productivity, that
compounds in a pretty big


145
0:5:59,867 --> 0:6:4,5
way and companies that
weren't on that curve are


146
0:6:4,5 --> 0:6:6,66
no longer with us.


147
0:6:6,66 --> 0:6:7,633
It's hard to measure
productivity in


148
0:6:7,633 --> 0:6:9,9
the federal government.


149
0:6:9,9 --> 0:6:14,133
But the best metric is
some work done by McKinsey


150
0:6:14,133 --> 0:6:16,533
which says that the
federal sector has grown


151
0:6:16,533 --> 0:6:19,33
in productivity but slower
than the private sector.


152
0:6:19,33 --> 0:6:21,0
So there is a gap, a
productivity gap between


153
0:6:21,0 --> 0:6:23,834
how the federal sector has
increased its productivity


154
0:6:23,834 --> 0:6:25,266
across the last couple
of decades and what the


155
0:6:25,266 --> 0:6:27,166
private sector has done.


156
0:6:27,166 --> 0:6:30,266
We all know that it is
wrong to assume technology


157
0:6:30,266 --> 0:6:32,3
is the answer and lead
with technology but


158
0:6:32,3 --> 0:6:33,9
technology at the same
time has been at the


159
0:6:33,9 --> 0:6:37,233
center of those
productivity gains.


160
0:6:37,233 --> 0:6:40,333
And we need to close
that productivity gap.


161
0:6:40,333 --> 0:6:43,7
So central to closing
that productivity gap is


162
0:6:43,7 --> 0:6:45,266
improving innovation
and technology in


163
0:6:45,266 --> 0:6:47,0
the federal government.


164
0:6:47,0 --> 0:6:49,8
And I think we have made
some good progress since


165
0:6:49,8 --> 0:6:51,33
the very beginning of
the Administration.


166
0:6:51,33 --> 0:6:53,266
We have great people in
the federal government.


167
0:6:53,266 --> 0:6:54,8
The idea of pairing the
great people in the


168
0:6:54,8 --> 0:6:56,5
federal government with
the best of the private


169
0:6:56,5 --> 0:7:0,7
sector to accelerate those
efforts has me and all of


170
0:7:0,7 --> 0:7:4,867
us incredibly excited
by the potential.


171
0:7:4,867 --> 0:7:8,367
I think that this is, all
of us here, are present at


172
0:7:8,367 --> 0:7:10,2
the creation of
something great.


173
0:7:10,2 --> 0:7:12,133
We're starting with
-- is it 18 or 19?


174
0:7:12,133 --> 0:7:12,834
Steven Van Roekel:
Eighteen.


175
0:7:12,834 --> 0:7:14,7
Jeff Zients
-- eighteen, I think we will


176
0:7:14,7 --> 0:7:17,266
compound in a big way and
look back and say remember


177
0:7:17,266 --> 0:7:19,567
when we were only 18?


178
0:7:19,567 --> 0:7:21,5
Because this idea of
bringing the best of the


179
0:7:21,5 --> 0:7:24,433
private sector to the
federal government and


180
0:7:24,433 --> 0:7:26,467
pairing our great
resources here in the


181
0:7:26,467 --> 0:7:27,867
federal government with
the private sector is


182
0:7:27,867 --> 0:7:29,8
something that we need to
be doing more and more of.


183
0:7:29,8 --> 0:7:31,967
So thank you all
for being pioneers.


184
0:7:31,967 --> 0:7:35,33
I am incredibly excited
by the early work.


185
0:7:35,33 --> 0:7:37,7
And look forward to a
great future of technology


186
0:7:37,7 --> 0:7:39,166
and innovation in the
federal government.


187
0:7:39,166 --> 0:7:39,9
Thank you.


188
0:7:39,9 --> 0:7:51,7
[applause]


189
0:7:51,7 --> 0:7:54,734
John Berry:
Well, congratulations
to our fellows.


190
0:7:54,734 --> 0:7:56,767
I'm John Berry, the
Director of the Office of


191
0:7:56,767 --> 0:8:2,66
Personnel Management,
the people side of the equation.


192
0:8:2,66 --> 0:8:5,467
And as everybody knows,
innovation starts with


193
0:8:5,467 --> 0:8:7,433
an idea somewhere.


194
0:8:7,433 --> 0:8:11,2
A lightbulb that happened
over somebody's head,


195
0:8:11,2 --> 0:8:15,767
came out of a discussion, was
provoked by an observation


196
0:8:15,767 --> 0:8:19,567
or inspired by a thought.


197
0:8:19,567 --> 0:8:24,33
And innovation is only
worthwhile, I would argue,


198
0:8:24,33 --> 0:8:28,133
if it benefits somebody
because it makes


199
0:8:28,133 --> 0:8:30,3
people's lives better.


200
0:8:30,3 --> 0:8:33,133
Because it makes
their lives easier.


201
0:8:33,133 --> 0:8:36,9
Or maybe it makes
their lives longer.


202
0:8:36,9 --> 0:8:40,767
And we can't forget that
from end to end, there is


203
0:8:40,767 --> 0:8:45,166
always a human
element in innovation.


204
0:8:45,166 --> 0:8:48,9
Now, we've tried to focus
on human-centered design


205
0:8:48,9 --> 0:8:52,0
in our approaches at OPM.


206
0:8:52,0 --> 0:8:55,867
We've launched our innovation lab around that concept.


207
0:8:55,867 --> 0:8:58,9
And we are participating fully in collaborative


208
0:8:58,9 --> 0:9:1,233
initiatives like this one.


209
0:9:1,233 --> 0:9:3,7
And so that's why I wanted
to focus on the human


210
0:9:3,7 --> 0:9:7,166
collaboration side of
innovation and the


211
0:9:7,166 --> 0:9:9,533
reasoning behind the
Presidential Innovative


212
0:9:9,533 --> 0:9:13,867
Fellows, Bill Joy,
a Co-founder of


213
0:9:13,867 --> 0:9:19,467
Sun Microsystems, pointed out
what is now known as Joy's Law.


214
0:9:19,467 --> 0:9:22,7
No matter who you are,
most of the smartest


215
0:9:22,7 --> 0:9:26,767
people work for
somebody else.


216
0:9:26,767 --> 0:9:29,8
Now, while we have great
teams in the government


217
0:9:29,8 --> 0:9:34,166
already, and that was
proven once again last


218
0:9:34,166 --> 0:9:36,867
week with the landing, the
successful landing of the


219
0:9:36,867 --> 0:9:42,667
Mars Rover, which was a
phenomenal success, there


220
0:9:42,667 --> 0:9:47,66
are also a lot of really
smart, talented folks in


221
0:9:47,66 --> 0:9:50,567
the private sector, in
academia, and in


222
0:9:50,567 --> 0:9:52,934
the nonprofit world.


223
0:9:52,934 --> 0:9:55,767
And what if we were to
team some of these best


224
0:9:55,767 --> 0:9:59,1
innovators outside of
government with some of


225
0:9:59,1 --> 0:10:2,5
our brightest innovators
inside of government,


226
0:10:2,5 --> 0:10:5,633
just imagine what we
might accomplish!


227
0:10:5,633 --> 0:10:8,5
And that's where this
program came in.


228
0:10:8,5 --> 0:10:11,5
We laid out five
challenges.


229
0:10:11,5 --> 0:10:16,0
And we said, okay, who
wants to tackle these?


230
0:10:16,0 --> 0:10:20,133
And as you've heard, the
response was amazing.


231
0:10:20,133 --> 0:10:23,633
For the 18 fellowship
spots, we received over


232
0:10:23,633 --> 0:10:27,8
700 applications
representing tremendously


233
0:10:27,8 --> 0:10:31,0
diverse backgrounds
and incredible talent.


234
0:10:31,0 --> 0:10:33,7
Applicants willing to drop
everything, move here to


235
0:10:33,7 --> 0:10:37,567
D.C., and serve
their country.


236
0:10:37,567 --> 0:10:40,467
And from that pool of
talent, we have assembled


237
0:10:40,467 --> 0:10:45,266
the truly impressive teams that you're going to see here today.


238
0:10:45,266 --> 0:10:47,8
You're going to see
what I mean in a moment.


239
0:10:47,8 --> 0:10:50,166
People from nuclear
engineering, start-up


240
0:10:50,166 --> 0:10:53,533
businesses, and best
selling books, these


241
0:10:53,533 --> 0:10:56,433
fellows are brimming
with talent,


242
0:10:56,433 --> 0:10:59,8
accomplishment and courage.


243
0:10:59,8 --> 0:11:3,734
But before we introduce
our new teams, let me just


244
0:11:3,734 --> 0:11:7,867
reach back for a quick
moment 200 years to a


245
0:11:7,867 --> 0:11:12,8
British admiral, Horatio
Nelson, now famous for his


246
0:11:12,8 --> 0:11:16,0
very brilliant
Naval victories.


247
0:11:16,0 --> 0:11:20,934
He won battle after
battle, often outgunned


248
0:11:20,934 --> 0:11:25,1
and outnumbered, and he
did it because unlike many


249
0:11:25,1 --> 0:11:30,533
admirals before or since,
he didn't depend on direct


250
0:11:30,533 --> 0:11:33,667
command over every ship.


251
0:11:33,667 --> 0:11:37,1
And he didn't stick to
textbook tactics that


252
0:11:37,1 --> 0:11:41,3
everyone had used
for years and years.


253
0:11:41,3 --> 0:11:44,467
Instead, Nelson discussed
strategy with his captains


254
0:11:44,467 --> 0:11:49,8
well in advance and set
for them broad goals that


255
0:11:49,8 --> 0:11:52,9
he expected them to
achieve in whatever battle


256
0:11:52,9 --> 0:11:55,633
they would find
themselves.


257
0:11:55,633 --> 0:11:59,9
His approach meant that
when his fleet engaged


258
0:11:59,9 --> 0:12:2,2
another, his captains knew
immediately how to work


259
0:12:2,2 --> 0:12:6,2
together, react quickly,
and to work towards those


260
0:12:6,2 --> 0:12:10,3
overall goals that Nelson
had set without waiting


261
0:12:10,3 --> 0:12:12,333
for specific orders.


262
0:12:12,333 --> 0:12:16,66
It meant more brains and
more creativity were


263
0:12:16,66 --> 0:12:20,9
unleashed on Nelson's side
than on his adversaries'.


264
0:12:20,9 --> 0:12:25,3
Now, we're asking
you the same thing.


265
0:12:25,3 --> 0:12:28,533
We have set out these five
broad goals and we're


266
0:12:28,533 --> 0:12:31,667
counting on your smarts
and your creativity in


267
0:12:31,667 --> 0:12:35,133
figuring out ways how to
reach these goals better


268
0:12:35,133 --> 0:12:37,333
and more efficiently.


269
0:12:37,333 --> 0:12:40,567
New ways for our
government to operate


270
0:12:40,567 --> 0:12:46,4
using ideas that right now most of us can't even imagine.


271
0:12:46,4 --> 0:12:51,467
We're counting on you to
think boldly, fail early,


272
0:12:51,467 --> 0:12:58,934
learn quickly, and above
all, dare to do great things!


273
0:12:58,934 --> 0:13:1,8
Do good things!


274
0:13:1,8 --> 0:13:5,33
And now it's time to hear
about each of our great


275
0:13:5,33 --> 0:13:8,5
projects today and meet
the teams that are going


276
0:13:8,5 --> 0:13:10,467
to be powering them.


277
0:13:10,467 --> 0:13:12,834
To kick things off, would
you please welcome


278
0:13:12,834 --> 0:13:16,66
Peter Levin, the Chief
Technology Officer of the


279
0:13:16,66 --> 0:13:18,66
Department of Veterans
Affairs


280
0:13:18,66 --> 0:13:22,333
and Farzad Mostashari, the National Coordinator for Health


281
0:13:22,333 --> 0:13:24,467
Information and Technology
at the Department of


282
0:13:24,467 --> 0:13:26,0
Health and Human Services.


283
0:13:26,0 --> 0:13:26,867
Take it away, guys!


284
0:13:26,867 --> 0:13:35,9
[applause]


285
0:13:35,9 --> 0:13:37,367
Peter Levin:
Well, hello and good morning, everybody.


286
0:13:37,367 --> 0:13:39,9
Audience Members:
Good morning.


287
0:13:39,9 --> 0:13:41,8
Peter Levin:
We are so happy to
be here and to


288
0:13:41,8 --> 0:13:44,2
kick off this discussion
of the Presidential


289
0:13:44,2 --> 0:13:48,266
Innovation Fellows with a
conversation about Blue Button.


290
0:13:48,266 --> 0:13:49,567
Some of you might have
already heard about Blue


291
0:13:49,567 --> 0:13:51,567
Button but in the next
couple of minutes, ten or so,


292
0:13:51,567 --> 0:13:54,667
we're going to explain
to you why we've done this


293
0:13:54,667 --> 0:13:55,8
and what's coming next.


294
0:13:55,8 --> 0:13:58,734
It's so exciting I can
hardly talk ...


295
0:13:58,734 --> 0:14:1,433
but I'm going to try.


296
0:14:1,433 --> 0:14:6,533
If you have a parent, if
you are a parent, you


297
0:14:6,533 --> 0:14:9,9
might have a partner that
you care about or a pulse


298
0:14:9,9 --> 0:14:12,834
you want to keep going for
a long time, then you know


299
0:14:12,834 --> 0:14:17,767
what a pain it is to get
your medical records.


300
0:14:17,767 --> 0:14:20,667
So imagine this situation
just as a "for instance."


301
0:14:20,667 --> 0:14:23,33
You have an elderly
parent, an elderly mom,


302
0:14:23,33 --> 0:14:25,1
and she is living in
Washington, D.C. a couple


303
0:14:25,1 --> 0:14:29,133
months ago, she is
relatively healthy but she


304
0:14:29,133 --> 0:14:30,9
has got to take a few meds
every day, she has got to


305
0:14:30,9 --> 0:14:33,7
remember to do this every
day, and all of a sudden a


306
0:14:33,7 --> 0:14:36,266
ferocious storm comes
along and knocks out the


307
0:14:36,266 --> 0:14:38,734
power to her house.


308
0:14:38,734 --> 0:14:42,0
Now, it ends up that
that's not really the crisis.


309
0:14:42,0 --> 0:14:44,967
The crisis occurs a couple
minutes later when she


310
0:14:44,967 --> 0:14:49,433
falls down and she has to
go to the emergency room.


311
0:14:49,433 --> 0:14:51,834
And she can't
remember her meds.


312
0:14:51,834 --> 0:14:53,367
She is not going to
remember the name.


313
0:14:53,367 --> 0:14:54,934
She is not going to
remember the dosage.


314
0:14:54,934 --> 0:14:56,867
She is not going to
remember the frequency,


315
0:14:56,867 --> 0:14:58,5
how often she
has to take it.


316
0:14:58,5 --> 0:14:59,533
And you know something?


317
0:14:59,533 --> 0:15:2,467
You're not going to
remember it either.


318
0:15:2,467 --> 0:15:4,4
Let me give you another
"for instance."


319
0:15:4,4 --> 0:15:6,767
What if you're a doc,
imagine you're a doctor


320
0:15:6,767 --> 0:15:9,967
and a patient comes in to
see you and the guy seems


321
0:15:9,967 --> 0:15:12,9
okay, he seems smart,
he seems lucid.


322
0:15:12,9 --> 0:15:15,33
He's got a problem, that's
why he's there, and you're


323
0:15:15,33 --> 0:15:17,5
going through the medical
history and he remembers


324
0:15:17,5 --> 0:15:19,0
everything, he has got
most of it written down,


325
0:15:19,0 --> 0:15:20,867
but not all of it, but
okay, it's time for the


326
0:15:20,867 --> 0:15:23,3
physical exam, the guy
takes off his shirt and


327
0:15:23,3 --> 0:15:25,967
there's a big scar
right down the middle.


328
0:15:25,967 --> 0:15:27,767
The guy says, Wow!
What's that?


329
0:15:27,767 --> 0:15:29,533
He says, oh, my God, I
forgot to tell you, I had


330
0:15:29,533 --> 0:15:31,767
open heart surgery a
couple of years ago . . .


331
0:15:31,767 --> 0:15:35,7
you know, something like that would be good to know! Right?


332
0:15:35,7 --> 0:15:43,967
So now we have these
problems, so now we have


333
0:15:43,967 --> 0:15:45,834
these problems
of complexity.


334
0:15:45,834 --> 0:15:49,333
So if you're a doctor, you
have got to keep all of


335
0:15:49,333 --> 0:15:51,0
this stuff in your head,
you're dealing with


336
0:15:51,0 --> 0:15:53,367
hundreds or thousands
of patients.


337
0:15:53,367 --> 0:15:57,4
If you're a patient, you
may have dozens of doctors


338
0:15:57,4 --> 0:15:59,834
and they all need
the same information.


339
0:15:59,834 --> 0:16:1,4
And you know something?


340
0:16:1,4 --> 0:16:4,967
The combination of that
complexity, thousands of


341
0:16:4,967 --> 0:16:7,767
diagnoses, thousands of
conditions, thousands of


342
0:16:7,767 --> 0:16:12,767
medications, dozens of
doctors, combine that with


343
0:16:12,767 --> 0:16:17,333
paper and people, this
is a losing combination, folks.


344
0:16:17,333 --> 0:16:21,233
This is not where
you want to be.


345
0:16:21,233 --> 0:16:23,266
But I have good news.


346
0:16:23,266 --> 0:16:26,667
The days of having to
remember everything or


347
0:16:26,667 --> 0:16:29,867
remember where you put
everything, are numbered.


348
0:16:29,867 --> 0:16:32,9
The days of having to
schlep around a suitcase --


349
0:16:32,9 --> 0:16:35,767
I've seen pictures of
this-- schlep around a suitcase


350
0:16:35,767 --> 0:16:38,266
full of the
medicines you have taken,


351
0:16:38,266 --> 0:16:41,433
your surgical history, the
immunizations you and your


352
0:16:41,433 --> 0:16:45,3
kids have had, the films
of your radiological


353
0:16:45,3 --> 0:16:50,367
studies, all that stuff
is about to move from


354
0:16:50,367 --> 0:16:53,166
physical atoms to
electrons as we're going


355
0:16:53,166 --> 0:16:55,5
to put it in the cloud.


356
0:16:55,5 --> 0:16:56,867
Those days are numbered.


357
0:16:56,867 --> 0:17:1,567
In 2010, two years ago
this month, President


358
0:17:1,567 --> 0:17:4,33
Obama announced that the
Department of Veterans


359
0:17:4,33 --> 0:17:8,1
Affairs, where I work, is
going to make the personal


360
0:17:8,1 --> 0:17:12,66
health record of veterans
available online with


361
0:17:12,66 --> 0:17:15,467
something called
Blue Button.


362
0:17:15,467 --> 0:17:18,567
Blue Button was and is
still today an


363
0:17:18,567 --> 0:17:20,7
incredibly simple idea.


364
0:17:20,7 --> 0:17:24,233
It basically just puts
electronic information in


365
0:17:24,233 --> 0:17:29,934
the hands of veterans
safely, reliably,


366
0:17:29,934 --> 0:17:35,467
conveniently, stuff that
we all would want for ourselves.


367
0:17:35,467 --> 0:17:38,633
So in the words of
President Obama, with the


368
0:17:38,633 --> 0:17:42,2
push of a button, your
records are downloaded,


369
0:17:42,2 --> 0:17:44,1
and you can share them
with your doctor or with


370
0:17:44,1 --> 0:17:46,467
other people you trust.


371
0:17:46,467 --> 0:17:50,166
All we did really was put
the name where the name


372
0:17:50,166 --> 0:17:51,2
is supposed to go.


373
0:17:51,2 --> 0:17:53,7
Medications and a
list of medications.


374
0:17:53,7 --> 0:17:56,3
Penicillin, even if it
wasn't spelled right, goes


375
0:17:56,3 --> 0:17:58,467
in the medications part.


376
0:17:58,467 --> 0:17:59,233
And sore throat?


377
0:17:59,233 --> 0:18:0,433
Well, that's a problem.


378
0:18:0,433 --> 0:18:1,934
That's maybe why you are
in the doctor's office


379
0:18:1,934 --> 0:18:4,133
today, we just
listed that as well.


380
0:18:4,133 --> 0:18:7,133
The trick -- this is not
a hard technical problem, right?


381
0:18:7,133 --> 0:18:9,7
The trick really is to
break through the red


382
0:18:9,7 --> 0:18:13,7
tape, the can'ts and the
don'ts and I don't wannas


383
0:18:13,7 --> 0:18:16,4
and what about this and
all about that, right?


384
0:18:16,4 --> 0:18:19,433
Was to make people
aware that it wasn't a


385
0:18:19,433 --> 0:18:22,0
technology problem and
that the clinical, the


386
0:18:22,0 --> 0:18:25,667
operational, the patient
impact was immeasurable.


387
0:18:25,667 --> 0:18:27,33
And we did.


388
0:18:27,33 --> 0:18:29,367
So you might say, well,
jeez, I mean, all you've


389
0:18:29,367 --> 0:18:32,567
done is give some silly
ASCII files, the kind of


390
0:18:32,567 --> 0:18:35,133
files that any person can
read on a screen or on a


391
0:18:35,133 --> 0:18:38,467
mobile device, all you've
done is give that to


392
0:18:38,467 --> 0:18:41,633
people and put it, oh, my
God, you put it in the


393
0:18:41,633 --> 0:18:45,5
hands of patients? Really?


394
0:18:45,5 --> 0:18:47,767
And yet that's
exactly what we did.


395
0:18:47,767 --> 0:18:50,166
We took that file and we
said it's available to you.


396
0:18:50,166 --> 0:18:54,834
And we've done it
now 1 million times!


397
0:18:54,834 --> 0:19:2,6
[applause]


398
0:19:2,6 --> 0:19:4,2
So just a few
days after President


399
0:19:4,2 --> 0:19:8,166
Obama's announcement, not
only did the VA make their


400
0:19:8,166 --> 0:19:12,934
Blue Button available, so
did CMS, so did DOD, and


401
0:19:12,934 --> 0:19:16,0
shortly thereafter, a lot
of our private sector


402
0:19:16,0 --> 0:19:18,3
partners are now making
their Blue Buttons


403
0:19:18,3 --> 0:19:22,33
available, too.


404
0:19:22,33 --> 0:19:25,233
Now today fast forward two
years later, thanks to


405
0:19:25,233 --> 0:19:27,467
Director Berry's
leadership, all of the


406
0:19:27,467 --> 0:19:30,233
carriers of federal health
insurance, all the people


407
0:19:30,233 --> 0:19:32,367
that insure all the folks
that work for the federal


408
0:19:32,367 --> 0:19:35,867
government, they're going
to make a Blue Button available.


409
0:19:35,867 --> 0:19:38,233
Thank you, very much!


410
0:19:38,233 --> 0:19:41,2
Large software companies
of your acquittance have


411
0:19:41,2 --> 0:19:45,66
readers, large insurers
that you probably know or


412
0:19:45,66 --> 0:19:47,967
even belong to are going
to say -- are going to


413
0:19:47,967 --> 0:19:50,433
open up the floodgates
on that data.


414
0:19:50,433 --> 0:19:54,734
Last month 80,000 people
just at the VA alone


415
0:19:54,734 --> 0:19:56,834
downloaded their
personal health records.


416
0:19:56,834 --> 0:19:59,867
That number is going
up and to the right.


417
0:19:59,867 --> 0:20:2,166
And as I said, in less
than two years a million


418
0:20:2,166 --> 0:20:4,9
people have already
used the Blue Button


419
0:20:4,9 --> 0:20:7,233
successfully and happily.


420
0:20:7,233 --> 0:20:11,233
Now, if you're Todd Park,
you say, a million people?


421
0:20:11,233 --> 0:20:12,734
That's amazing!


422
0:20:12,734 --> 0:20:13,8
We should have some
Presidential innovation


423
0:20:13,8 --> 0:20:15,967
fellows to help
to make it bigger.


424
0:20:15,967 --> 0:20:19,133
And if you are Dr. Farzad
Mostashari, you say,


425
0:20:19,133 --> 0:20:21,1
eh, it's good.


426
0:20:21,1 --> 0:20:22,367
It's a nice start.


427
0:20:22,367 --> 0:20:23,567
Farzad Mostashari:
It's a good start, Peter.


428
0:20:23,567 --> 0:20:26,367
It's a good start.


429
0:20:26,367 --> 0:20:27,2
Peter Levin:
Farzad?


430
0:20:27,2 --> 0:20:27,9
Farzad Mostashari:
Thank you.


431
0:20:27,9 --> 0:20:30,633
Peter Levin:
What are
we going to do next?


432
0:20:30,633 --> 0:20:35,433
Farzad Mostashari:
So now what?


433
0:20:35,433 --> 0:20:41,734
The VA brilliantly moved
simply to be able to make


434
0:20:41,734 --> 0:20:45,233
this information available
to veterans and as we


435
0:20:45,233 --> 0:20:49,266
heard, a million veterans
have downloaded their information.


436
0:20:49,266 --> 0:20:53,4
And where the VA led,
others have now followed.


437
0:20:53,4 --> 0:20:56,33
So how do we take this
to the next level?


438
0:20:56,33 --> 0:20:59,66
We have an MVP, right?


439
0:20:59,66 --> 0:21:0,834
And for you startup
folks out there,


440
0:21:0,834 --> 0:21:4,33
this minimally viable product.


441
0:21:4,33 --> 0:21:8,166
But it's not
really a product.


442
0:21:8,166 --> 0:21:14,2
We're not trying to get 10
million of some thing sold


443
0:21:14,2 --> 0:21:17,166
or a hundred million.


444
0:21:17,166 --> 0:21:18,667
It's an idea.


445
0:21:18,667 --> 0:21:23,2
It's an attitude that
says it's okay to get


446
0:21:23,2 --> 0:21:27,166
your own record.


447
0:21:27,166 --> 0:21:31,233
It's an attitude among
providers of openness.


448
0:21:31,233 --> 0:21:34,5
Openness means letting
other people help.


449
0:21:34,5 --> 0:21:36,433
When you are talking about
open government, when


450
0:21:36,433 --> 0:21:38,667
we're talking about open
data, when we're talking


451
0:21:38,667 --> 0:21:43,934
about opening, that means
letting others help.


452
0:21:43,934 --> 0:21:48,633
And in this case, who
are we letting help?


453
0:21:48,633 --> 0:21:49,533
The patient.


454
0:21:49,533 --> 0:21:54,7
We're letting the patient and the people who love them help.


455
0:21:54,7 --> 0:21:58,767
So it's an attitude,
and it's an action.


456
0:21:58,767 --> 0:22:3,3
Let's turn Blue Button
from a noun to a verb.


457
0:22:3,3 --> 0:22:5,433
So I can say, you know, I
was talking to my mom last


458
0:22:5,433 --> 0:22:7,266
night, I'm kind of worried
about her, yeah, she's


459
0:22:7,266 --> 0:22:9,33
going to Blue Button those
scans, and we're going to


460
0:22:9,33 --> 0:22:10,867
send them to my uncle.


461
0:22:10,867 --> 0:22:12,1
That's what we want to do.


462
0:22:12,1 --> 0:22:14,233
We want to make
it an action.


463
0:22:14,233 --> 0:22:17,633
To do that, we're going to
need help to take this to


464
0:22:17,633 --> 0:22:23,367
the next level up on three
fronts, that's why


465
0:22:23,367 --> 0:22:24,2
we got three fellows.


466
0:22:24,2 --> 0:22:25,967
[laughter]


467
0:22:25,967 --> 0:22:27,667
Each of you guys have
got to solve one


468
0:22:27,667 --> 0:22:29,834
of these problems, right?


469
0:22:29,834 --> 0:22:33,367
The first is people, we've got to change those attitudes.


470
0:22:33,367 --> 0:22:35,934
You've got to know that
you can get it and


471
0:22:35,934 --> 0:22:39,6
increasingly today,
right now, you can't.


472
0:22:39,6 --> 0:22:45,0
If I go all over America
and I say to one of you


473
0:22:45,0 --> 0:22:46,2
ask your doctor.


474
0:22:46,2 --> 0:22:49,533
In fact, ask your doctor!


475
0:22:49,533 --> 0:22:53,166
Do that.
Say what's in my record?


476
0:22:53,166 --> 0:22:54,767
Believe me. Trust me.


477
0:22:54,767 --> 0:22:56,667
Trust Leon Rodriguez, the
head of the Office of


478
0:22:56,667 --> 0:23:1,6
Civil Rights, it's
not against HIPAA.


479
0:23:1,6 --> 0:23:3,433
It's not against HIPAA to
ask for your own records.


480
0:23:3,433 --> 0:23:4,433
It actually is your right.


481
0:23:4,433 --> 0:23:6,133
But we need to
stimulate that demand.


482
0:23:6,133 --> 0:23:8,5
We need to have more
people asking, saying can


483
0:23:8,5 --> 0:23:11,734
I get a copy of
my own records?


484
0:23:11,734 --> 0:23:13,133
If you're on Medicare
now you can get a


485
0:23:13,133 --> 0:23:14,5
copy of your records.


486
0:23:14,5 --> 0:23:16,567
If you're a veteran now you can get a copy of your records.


487
0:23:16,567 --> 0:23:20,66
Increasingly we're going
to work with those who


488
0:23:20,66 --> 0:23:23,4
hold the data to change those attitudes and make it available.


489
0:23:23,4 --> 0:23:26,834
Stimulate the demand, the
attitudes on the one hand


490
0:23:26,834 --> 0:23:29,266
and the access on
the other hand.


491
0:23:29,266 --> 0:23:31,3
And this is the most fun
part, well, it's the


492
0:23:31,3 --> 0:23:34,133
fellow I'm going to be
working with, the most fun


493
0:23:34,133 --> 0:23:37,66
is going to be not just
having it be data that,


494
0:23:37,66 --> 0:23:39,3
yes, you can print and you
can read and you can have,


495
0:23:39,3 --> 0:23:43,266
and you can share, but
things you can do with it now.


496
0:23:43,266 --> 0:23:47,33
To have that data, that
information and the


497
0:23:47,33 --> 0:23:50,367
incentives turn into
combustible magic


498
0:23:50,367 --> 0:23:52,934
in the startup crucible.


499
0:23:52,934 --> 0:23:56,433
To have people help you
use your data to do things


500
0:23:56,433 --> 0:23:58,233
you want to do.


501
0:23:58,233 --> 0:23:59,2
I want to manage
my health.


502
0:23:59,2 --> 0:24:0,567
I want to connect
to other people.


503
0:24:0,567 --> 0:24:2,33
I want to manage my
health care finances.


504
0:24:2,33 --> 0:24:3,133
I want to get a
second opinion.


505
0:24:3,133 --> 0:24:5,7
I want to find a
clinical trial.


506
0:24:5,7 --> 0:24:7,333
I want to be able
to do things.


507
0:24:7,333 --> 0:24:9,8
And for that we need to
not just liberate the data


508
0:24:9,8 --> 0:24:12,4
but we need to make it so
that those entrepreneurs


509
0:24:12,4 --> 0:24:15,367
can come in an openness
to that innovation.


510
0:24:15,367 --> 0:24:18,967
And that's what
we're going to do.


511
0:24:18,967 --> 0:24:20,4
So that's our goal.


512
0:24:20,4 --> 0:24:24,7
Is to take the million,
and call it a good start,


513
0:24:24,7 --> 0:24:27,9
and say how do we take it
to 10 million by next year


514
0:24:27,9 --> 0:24:34,1
and a hundred million
two years from now.


515
0:24:34,1 --> 0:24:38,934
So meet the Blue
Button Team.


516
0:24:38,934 --> 0:24:45,266
I talked to Ryan
Panchadsaram on the phone


517
0:24:45,266 --> 0:24:47,3
as we were interviewing
these phenomenal -- hang


518
0:24:47,3 --> 0:24:48,867
on, I'm going to praise
you for a sec --


519
0:24:48,867 --> 0:24:56,367
[laughter]


520
0:24:56,367 --> 0:24:58,9
-- as we
were interviewing these


521
0:24:58,9 --> 0:25:0,467
amazing, and it was like
amazing candidate after


522
0:25:0,467 --> 0:25:2,6
amazing candidate, we were
like, oh, we've got to get


523
0:25:2,6 --> 0:25:3,867
that one, oh, how
could we do better?


524
0:25:3,867 --> 0:25:6,834
And then I talked to Ryan,
and, yeah, he graduated


525
0:25:6,834 --> 0:25:9,633
from UC Berkeley with
engineering and he has


526
0:25:9,633 --> 0:25:12,7
this real design
sensibility and he worked


527
0:25:12,7 --> 0:25:16,867
on, he was in charge of
Microsoft Outlook for Mac


528
0:25:16,867 --> 0:25:20,633
and getting that, all of
you all love that, right?


529
0:25:20,633 --> 0:25:24,66
-- the design sense that
he won the 2012 Google's


530
0:25:24,66 --> 0:25:26,7
International Design
Information Design


531
0:25:26,7 --> 0:25:28,533
Visualization competition.


532
0:25:28,533 --> 0:25:30,3
And he's this amazing guy.


533
0:25:30,3 --> 0:25:35,567
But what got me goose
bumps was when he said


534
0:25:35,567 --> 0:25:39,667
when I was 18, I talked to
my parents -- and we go


535
0:25:39,667 --> 0:25:41,4
back and we started with
veterans, we go back to


536
0:25:41,4 --> 0:25:46,233
veterans -- and he said,
my mom is a marine, my dad


537
0:25:46,233 --> 0:25:49,133
was in the Air Force and
served in the Navy, and I


538
0:25:49,133 --> 0:25:53,333
always thought that I
would join the military,


539
0:25:53,333 --> 0:25:57,2
that I would be in the
armed forces and the service.


540
0:25:57,2 --> 0:26:2,567
And my parents said to me,
son, we did this so you


541
0:26:2,567 --> 0:26:7,66
could serve your
country a different way.


542
0:26:7,66 --> 0:26:9,333
And he said, when I
saw the Presidential


543
0:26:9,333 --> 0:26:12,33
Innovation Fellow
opportunity, I knew this


544
0:26:12,33 --> 0:26:14,7
was my way to serve.


545
0:26:14,7 --> 0:26:18,467
Ryan, come on up. Whooo!


546
0:26:18,467 --> 0:26:19,867
Congratulations.


547
0:26:19,867 --> 0:26:28,934
[applause]


548
0:26:28,934 --> 0:26:31,33
Peter Levin:
So the guy who I deal with


549
0:26:31,33 --> 0:26:33,533
a lot at OSTP besides the
CTO of the United States


550
0:26:33,533 --> 0:26:35,467
Todd Park, is this guy
standing over in the


551
0:26:35,467 --> 0:26:39,734
corner, John Farmer, calls me
up some Friday afternoon.


552
0:26:39,734 --> 0:26:40,834
John is very direct.


553
0:26:40,834 --> 0:26:42,633
You just do what he says.


554
0:26:42,633 --> 0:26:43,367
It's easier, right?


555
0:26:43,367 --> 0:26:45,66
[laughter]


556
0:26:45,66 --> 0:26:47,433
He says, listen, dude,
I got bad news for you.


557
0:26:47,433 --> 0:26:50,66
You've got until Monday to
cut the pile of resumés.


558
0:26:50,66 --> 0:26:51,767
And, you know, there
were 700 all together.


559
0:26:51,767 --> 0:26:54,4
I don't know how many were
Blue Button, there was 300?


560
0:26:54,4 --> 0:26:56,367
I mean, there
was a lot, right?


561
0:26:56,367 --> 0:26:58,333
And he says, you know,
how hard can it be?


562
0:26:58,333 --> 0:26:59,734
Okay, 300 resumés.


563
0:26:59,734 --> 0:27:1,9
Oh, my God!


564
0:27:1,9 --> 0:27:5,6
The same experience
that Farzad has, right?


565
0:27:5,6 --> 0:27:12,233
And then I run into a resumé which just bowled me over.


566
0:27:12,233 --> 0:27:13,266
The guy's name
is Matt McCall.


567
0:27:13,266 --> 0:27:14,4
I know this name.


568
0:27:14,4 --> 0:27:15,867
I know who that guy is!


569
0:27:15,867 --> 0:27:16,8
I remember reading
about this.


570
0:27:16,8 --> 0:27:18,7
That wasn't the only one.


571
0:27:18,7 --> 0:27:20,834
And you're going through
it, and what we didn't


572
0:27:20,834 --> 0:27:23,66
about too much was that a
lot of what we're trying


573
0:27:23,66 --> 0:27:27,834
to accomplish here is not
build proprietary silos of


574
0:27:27,834 --> 0:27:31,333
secret code, of secret
sauce that only we have,


575
0:27:31,333 --> 0:27:32,333
only the government has.


576
0:27:32,333 --> 0:27:33,433
We're trying to make this
as open as possible.


577
0:27:33,433 --> 0:27:35,533
Literally put it into
the public domain.


578
0:27:35,533 --> 0:27:36,867
Literally make
it open source.


579
0:27:36,867 --> 0:27:39,867
Matt McCall did that
already on the platform


580
0:27:39,867 --> 0:27:42,734
that actually is the
driver of Blue Button.


581
0:27:42,734 --> 0:27:44,633
So Matt, would you
please come up.


582
0:27:44,633 --> 0:27:46,533
I'm so glad I found you.


583
0:27:46,533 --> 0:27:48,333
Farzad Mostashari:
Henry, come up, too.


584
0:27:48,333 --> 0:27:51,233
Matt McCall:
Thanks, very much.


585
0:27:51,233 --> 0:27:53,567
[applause]


586
0:27:53,567 --> 0:27:55,5
Peter Levin:
Okay, so that was
the easy one. Right?


587
0:27:55,5 --> 0:27:59,233
the harder one was a guy,
you know, finally Farmer


588
0:27:59,233 --> 0:28:1,66
is, I know he's going to
call me Monday morning, I


589
0:28:1,66 --> 0:28:2,166
know this is going
to be an unpleasant


590
0:28:2,166 --> 0:28:4,266
conversation, they mostly
are even when I have good news.


591
0:28:4,266 --> 0:28:8,266
[laughter]


592
0:28:8,266 --> 0:28:10,633
So I mean I've
got like the top three, right?


593
0:28:10,633 --> 0:28:12,7
And it's really hard, I've
got this checklist, excel


594
0:28:12,7 --> 0:28:14,66
spreadsheet, I'm an
engineer, right?


595
0:28:14,66 --> 0:28:16,3
So you know you
model all this stuff.


596
0:28:16,3 --> 0:28:19,433
And then I'm thinking, you
know, what I really want,


597
0:28:19,433 --> 0:28:20,7
you know, a most abstract
thing, what I really want


598
0:28:20,7 --> 0:28:24,834
is a guy who like knows
the provider/payor world,


599
0:28:24,834 --> 0:28:27,633
that, you know, has been
to places that I've heard


600
0:28:27,633 --> 0:28:30,0
of, it's like if I'm going
to hire somebody who I


601
0:28:30,0 --> 0:28:30,867
don't actually know very
well and never heard of


602
0:28:30,867 --> 0:28:33,7
before, and then I
get this phone call.


603
0:28:33,7 --> 0:28:35,166
It's like, hey,
you know something?


604
0:28:35,166 --> 0:28:38,33
You've got somebody in
your pile of 300 resumés


605
0:28:38,33 --> 0:28:39,9
that you probably want
to talk to and the guy's


606
0:28:39,9 --> 0:28:41,333
resumé was right in front
of me as I'm getting this


607
0:28:41,333 --> 0:28:43,2
phone call, it's
like, oh, my God!


608
0:28:43,2 --> 0:28:45,667
So Henry Wei -- please
come up and join us --


609
0:28:45,667 --> 0:28:50,266
[applause]


610
0:28:50,266 --> 0:28:53,734
-- his last
title at a major American


611
0:28:53,734 --> 0:28:58,5
health care provider was
Director of Clinical Innovations.


612
0:28:58,5 --> 0:29:1,266
But, oh, wait there's
more, undergraduate in the


613
0:29:1,266 --> 0:29:4,467
ivy league, medical
degree from Cornell.


614
0:29:4,467 --> 0:29:6,333
And this guy knows, this
guy has forgotten more


615
0:29:6,333 --> 0:29:10,367
than all of us together
know about health informatics.


616
0:29:10,367 --> 0:29:14,633
So can you imagine the
dream team, the people who


617
0:29:14,633 --> 0:29:16,3
build the platform, the
people who are going to


618
0:29:16,3 --> 0:29:18,734
stimulate customer demand,
and people are going to go


619
0:29:18,734 --> 0:29:20,834
around to all the
providers and say, it's


620
0:29:20,834 --> 0:29:23,867
okay, you can do this.


621
0:29:23,867 --> 0:29:25,934
And in fact we can
do this together.


622
0:29:25,934 --> 0:29:27,834
Thank you so much for
being here today.


623
0:29:27,834 --> 0:29:29,33
We're so excited
about this.


624
0:29:29,33 --> 0:29:35,633
[cheering and applause]


625
0:29:35,633 --> 0:29:39,6
Farzad Mostashari:
Next up we have Sean Greene
from the Small Business


626
0:29:39,6 --> 0:29:49,3
Association to kick
off the next group.


627
0:29:49,3 --> 0:29:50,8
Sean Greene:
Everyone, thanks for coming.


628
0:29:50,8 --> 0:29:51,4
I'm Sean Greene.


629
0:29:51,4 --> 0:29:52,734
I run the Investment and
Innovation Programs at the


630
0:29:52,734 --> 0:29:55,1
Small Business
Administration, SBA, and


631
0:29:55,1 --> 0:29:58,667
I'm here to talk about
Project RFP-EZ which is a


632
0:29:58,667 --> 0:30:2,166
project to make it easier
for startups to sell to


633
0:30:2,166 --> 0:30:5,2
the federal government and
to make procurement of


634
0:30:5,2 --> 0:30:9,233
federal I.T. better,
cheaper and faster.


635
0:30:9,233 --> 0:30:11,8
So to put it in context,
I think everybody in the


636
0:30:11,8 --> 0:30:14,667
room and those watching
at home know that


637
0:30:14,667 --> 0:30:16,767
particularly in the world
of the web and mobile


638
0:30:16,767 --> 0:30:23,567
development, costs have come down dramatically, 5X or more.


639
0:30:23,567 --> 0:30:26,5
And personally as someone
who formerly was a web


640
0:30:26,5 --> 0:30:29,233
entrepreneur and investor,
what I've seen is a


641
0:30:29,233 --> 0:30:32,934
massive disconnect between
how technology is being


642
0:30:32,934 --> 0:30:35,133
used in the private sector
and how it is being


643
0:30:35,133 --> 0:30:37,33
used in government.


644
0:30:37,33 --> 0:30:40,2
And I see that manifested
itself in the frustration


645
0:30:40,2 --> 0:30:43,3
of entrepreneurs who have
tried to sell to the


646
0:30:43,3 --> 0:30:45,4
federal government and
literally see a quote


647
0:30:45,4 --> 0:30:48,233
there from an entrepreneur
who said no matter how


648
0:30:48,233 --> 0:30:50,567
fast or better, and
cheaper my product, it's


649
0:30:50,567 --> 0:30:53,1
just impossible to sell to
the federal government.


650
0:30:53,1 --> 0:30:56,433
I see frustration in
venture capitalists who


651
0:30:56,433 --> 0:31:0,433
advise their portfolio
companies don't bother


652
0:31:0,433 --> 0:31:1,967
trying to sell to
the government.


653
0:31:1,967 --> 0:31:3,467
It's too much time.


654
0:31:3,467 --> 0:31:4,2
It's not worth the energy.


655
0:31:4,2 --> 0:31:6,266
It's not worth
the bandwidth.


656
0:31:6,266 --> 0:31:8,967
And if investors are
saying this, and telling


657
0:31:8,967 --> 0:31:11,233
their portfolio companies
not to bother selling to


658
0:31:11,233 --> 0:31:13,567
the largest customer in
the world, then we have


659
0:31:13,567 --> 0:31:15,834
something
fundamentally wrong.


660
0:31:15,834 --> 0:31:17,667
At the same time we see
opportunity and I will


661
0:31:17,667 --> 0:31:22,266
pick on Todd as others
have to give an example of


662
0:31:22,266 --> 0:31:26,133
when Todd was CTO at
health and human services,


663
0:31:26,133 --> 0:31:29,533
a team within HHS came to
him saying, Todd, we've


664
0:31:29,533 --> 0:31:30,2
got a problem.


665
0:31:30,2 --> 0:31:32,8
We've got an
important need here.


666
0:31:32,8 --> 0:31:35,266
The initial estimate on
the technology to serve


667
0:31:35,266 --> 0:31:37,934
this project
is $5 million.


668
0:31:37,934 --> 0:31:40,367
We just don't have that
much in our budget.


669
0:31:40,367 --> 0:31:43,433
And so Todd worked with
the team, pointed them to


670
0:31:43,433 --> 0:31:46,333
look at cloud-based
solutions.


671
0:31:46,333 --> 0:31:50,834
And as a result of that,
the team was able to go


672
0:31:50,834 --> 0:31:53,533
ahead, find some
innovative companies that


673
0:31:53,533 --> 0:31:58,133
could deliver the solution
for just over $400,000,


674
0:31:58,133 --> 0:32:0,333
10 X cheaper.


675
0:32:0,333 --> 0:32:2,467
And so the opportunity and
the challenge in front of


676
0:32:2,467 --> 0:32:4,3
us is how do we
replicate that.


677
0:32:4,3 --> 0:32:7,266
How do we make that
happen more often.


678
0:32:7,266 --> 0:32:8,533
And why should we care?


679
0:32:8,533 --> 0:32:11,0
Because there is a
tremendous opportunity for


680
0:32:11,0 --> 0:32:12,567
a win/win here.


681
0:32:12,567 --> 0:32:16,967
For the federal government
the win is an opportunity


682
0:32:16,967 --> 0:32:21,8
to save taxpayer dollars or get far more bang for the buck.


683
0:32:21,8 --> 0:32:22,7
And with federal I.T.


684
0:32:22,7 --> 0:32:26,233
procurement we're talking
about $80 billion.


685
0:32:26,233 --> 0:32:28,467
A massive, massive
opportunity.


686
0:32:28,467 --> 0:32:30,2
But it's also an
opportunity for the


687
0:32:30,2 --> 0:32:33,166
innovative startups who,
by the way, are the ones


688
0:32:33,166 --> 0:32:37,367
who create all of the net
new jobs in the economy.


689
0:32:37,367 --> 0:32:39,133
And so as we -- as I've
traveled around the


690
0:32:39,133 --> 0:32:40,5
country talking to
hundreds, more than a


691
0:32:40,5 --> 0:32:43,2
thousand entrepreneurs,
and we asked them what


692
0:32:43,2 --> 0:32:46,33
barriers they're facing to
growing their companies


693
0:32:46,33 --> 0:32:48,9
and creating jobs, we
heard about things like


694
0:32:48,9 --> 0:32:50,667
access to capital,
changing immigration


695
0:32:50,667 --> 0:32:53,533
policy, And we're excited
about the success and


696
0:32:53,533 --> 0:32:55,433
progress we've made.


697
0:32:55,433 --> 0:32:59,2
But what I've also heard
is, hey, make it easier to


698
0:32:59,2 --> 0:33:2,3
sell to the federal
government. Right?


699
0:33:2,3 --> 0:33:4,633
People have told
me make it easier.


700
0:33:4,633 --> 0:33:7,533
I know my product is
better, cheaper, but help


701
0:33:7,533 --> 0:33:10,133
me get my foot
in the door.


702
0:33:10,133 --> 0:33:12,867
And so the opportunity we
have in front of us is to


703
0:33:12,867 --> 0:33:15,867
help take the success
story that I pointed to


704
0:33:15,867 --> 0:33:18,266
Todd and let's replicate
that and scale that at a


705
0:33:18,266 --> 0:33:21,333
much bigger level and
let's help a lot more


706
0:33:21,333 --> 0:33:25,734
innovative companies get
their foot in the door.


707
0:33:25,734 --> 0:33:28,0
So to understand how to
do that, let's start with


708
0:33:28,0 --> 0:33:29,7
understanding the problem.


709
0:33:29,7 --> 0:33:32,33
The fundamental
problem is complexity.


710
0:33:32,33 --> 0:33:34,266
So here is how the federal
procurement process works


711
0:33:34,266 --> 0:33:35,7
for the uninitiated.


712
0:33:35,7 --> 0:33:37,467
It's all clearly mapped
out right there --


713
0:33:37,467 --> 0:33:38,633
[laughter]


714
0:33:38,633 --> 0:33:39,8
-- with, you
know, an example from the


715
0:33:39,8 --> 0:33:41,533
Department of Defense.


716
0:33:41,533 --> 0:33:44,133
So, you know, your startup
who is already working,


717
0:33:44,133 --> 0:33:47,33
you know, ridiculous
hours, where do you begin?


718
0:33:47,33 --> 0:33:50,66
Startups don't have
dedicated teams to help


719
0:33:50,66 --> 0:33:52,867
navigate the federal
procurement process.


720
0:33:52,867 --> 0:33:57,0
And at its core we have a
problem when the process


721
0:33:57,0 --> 0:34:1,433
for $150,000 software
procurement works the same


722
0:34:1,433 --> 0:34:6,567
way that it does for $150
million procurement.


723
0:34:6,567 --> 0:34:9,133
More broadly as we think
about the problem what we


724
0:34:9,133 --> 0:34:12,1
see is a fundamental gap
between the innovative


725
0:34:12,1 --> 0:34:15,133
startups and
federal buyers.


726
0:34:15,133 --> 0:34:17,266
So how do they find
each other, right?


727
0:34:17,266 --> 0:34:20,33
Most federal buyers don't
hang out on TechCrunch to


728
0:34:20,33 --> 0:34:22,2
find out what's the latest
and what's happening


729
0:34:22,2 --> 0:34:24,0
with innovative startups.


730
0:34:24,0 --> 0:34:26,967
The startups don't hang
out on Fed Biz Ops


731
0:34:26,967 --> 0:34:28,633
or Federal Register.


732
0:34:28,633 --> 0:34:31,166
Even if they know where
to find each other, what


733
0:34:31,166 --> 0:34:33,66
we're seeing is they speak
different languages.


734
0:34:33,66 --> 0:34:36,834
Startups don't speak
government acronymeese, right?


735
0:34:36,834 --> 0:34:38,333
People looking to do
web development for the


736
0:34:38,333 --> 0:34:41,266
government may have to
know how to search on


737
0:34:41,266 --> 0:34:44,967
terms like "content information distribution platform."


738
0:34:44,967 --> 0:34:47,4
So how do we get over
the language barrier?


739
0:34:47,4 --> 0:34:50,333
And then how do we
challenge the issue of


740
0:34:50,333 --> 0:34:52,266
just different
timeframes. Right?


741
0:34:52,266 --> 0:34:55,834
The traditional RFP
process that works in the


742
0:34:55,834 --> 0:34:59,4
federal government is three lifetimes for a startup.


743
0:34:59,4 --> 0:35:1,867
How do we address
those challenges?


744
0:35:1,867 --> 0:35:4,1
So our solution is
something we're calling


745
0:35:4,1 --> 0:35:6,567
RFP-EZ. Right?


746
0:35:6,567 --> 0:35:9,0
So RFP is request for
proposal, that's the


747
0:35:9,0 --> 0:35:12,8
traditional way government
initiates a contracting procedure.


748
0:35:12,8 --> 0:35:15,166
We're borrowing from a
successful example, the


749
0:35:15,166 --> 0:35:18,934
1040EZ and the metaphor,
right, that we all know


750
0:35:18,934 --> 0:35:21,967
that took something fairly
complicated and said, hey,


751
0:35:21,967 --> 0:35:24,4
for a subset of the people
who don't need all that


752
0:35:24,4 --> 0:35:28,166
complexity, how do we make
something easier to work.


753
0:35:28,166 --> 0:35:33,233
And we said let's bring that concept to procurement.


754
0:35:33,233 --> 0:35:35,967
Specifically we'll
start with federal I.T.


755
0:35:35,967 --> 0:35:38,0
And at its core what
we're trying to do is


756
0:35:38,0 --> 0:35:39,233
build a marketplace.


757
0:35:39,233 --> 0:35:42,467
A marketplace of buyers
and sellers,


758
0:35:42,467 --> 0:35:45,567
to bring together fragmented buyers and sellers to


759
0:35:45,567 --> 0:35:47,7
make transactions happen.


760
0:35:47,7 --> 0:35:49,8
And to the economists in
the room you know this is


761
0:35:49,8 --> 0:35:52,667
all about lowering
transaction costs.


762
0:35:52,667 --> 0:35:54,8
But to the entrepreneurs
in the room it's about


763
0:35:54,8 --> 0:35:57,767
making it faster
and simpler.


764
0:35:57,767 --> 0:35:59,5
So we're going to do that
by focusing on a couple


765
0:35:59,5 --> 0:36:1,4
of different things.


766
0:36:1,4 --> 0:36:3,633
First we're going to
focus on discovery.


767
0:36:3,633 --> 0:36:7,6
How do we help the buyers
and sellers find each other.


768
0:36:7,6 --> 0:36:10,266
With an opportunity to
leverage things like


769
0:36:10,266 --> 0:36:14,333
online directories, simple
video demos of products


770
0:36:14,333 --> 0:36:18,0
and services to help each other know what's available.


771
0:36:18,0 --> 0:36:20,9
And as appropriate,
in-person demo days that


772
0:36:20,9 --> 0:36:22,967
we know have worked very
effectively in the


773
0:36:22,967 --> 0:36:24,633
private sector, right?


774
0:36:24,633 --> 0:36:26,5
Because in the discovery
process you've got a


775
0:36:26,5 --> 0:36:29,1
chicken and egg
problem, right?


776
0:36:29,1 --> 0:36:31,533
If there aren't enough
government buyers, you


777
0:36:31,533 --> 0:36:33,767
can't get the innovative
startups to come.


778
0:36:33,767 --> 0:36:35,3
If you don't have
innovative startups with


779
0:36:35,3 --> 0:36:37,9
good products, the
buyers won't come.


780
0:36:37,9 --> 0:36:40,433
So simplifying a process
by which you can


781
0:36:40,433 --> 0:36:43,834
communicate helps that
discovery process.


782
0:36:43,834 --> 0:36:45,667
At the end of the day,
though, what we really


783
0:36:45,667 --> 0:36:48,767
want to do is to drive
more transactions.


784
0:36:48,767 --> 0:36:50,734
And so changing and
creating templates and


785
0:36:50,734 --> 0:36:53,4
simplified processes for
easier transactions are


786
0:36:53,4 --> 0:36:55,533
critically
important as well.


787
0:36:55,533 --> 0:36:58,3
So we have a screen shot
here of one specific


788
0:36:58,3 --> 0:37:0,767
module that the team has
been focused on that we're


789
0:37:0,767 --> 0:37:3,3
calling statement
of work composer.


790
0:37:3,3 --> 0:37:8,233
The whole idea here is a
simple templated solution


791
0:37:8,233 --> 0:37:10,834
that creates statements
of work for


792
0:37:10,834 --> 0:37:13,1
a specific procurement.


793
0:37:13,1 --> 0:37:16,233
Why this matters is to the
program officer who wants


794
0:37:16,233 --> 0:37:18,7
to do the buy, by
leveraging a template,


795
0:37:18,7 --> 0:37:20,66
half of the work
is already done.


796
0:37:20,66 --> 0:37:22,5
And they can get
it done faster.


797
0:37:22,5 --> 0:37:25,266
To contracting officers,
they then know that the


798
0:37:25,266 --> 0:37:28,834
language in this has been
reviewed by a group of


799
0:37:28,834 --> 0:37:31,433
their peers to make sure
it is valid, legitimate,


800
0:37:31,433 --> 0:37:32,166
et cetera.


801
0:37:32,166 --> 0:37:34,3
And then to the small
business, it's written in


802
0:37:34,3 --> 0:37:38,0
plain English in terms
friendly to them,


803
0:37:38,0 --> 0:37:41,1
understandable to them
to make it happen.


804
0:37:41,1 --> 0:37:45,5
So I point to a statement
of work composer not as an


805
0:37:45,5 --> 0:37:48,633
idea of something that
we want to do, but I'm


806
0:37:48,633 --> 0:37:53,433
incredibly pleased to say
the team is already ready


807
0:37:53,433 --> 0:37:54,8
to ship this product.


808
0:37:54,8 --> 0:37:57,166
So in the spirit of rapid
innovation, they said,


809
0:37:57,166 --> 0:37:59,133
let's not -- no pressure
to the other teams --


810
0:37:59,133 --> 0:38:0,4
[laughter]


811
0:38:0,4 --> 0:38:1,633
-- you know, we
haven't shipped anything


812
0:38:1,633 --> 0:38:4,8
yet, but the team has
already written the


813
0:38:4,8 --> 0:38:5,7
code for this.


814
0:38:5,7 --> 0:38:8,5
For the developer's paying
attention, they'll be


815
0:38:8,5 --> 0:38:11,133
posting the code to GitHub
later this afternoon.


816
0:38:11,133 --> 0:38:13,33
And very much in the
spirit of let's get


817
0:38:13,33 --> 0:38:15,2
something up and running,
let's get people to kick


818
0:38:15,2 --> 0:38:17,8
the tires, give feedback
and we'll rapidly innovate


819
0:38:17,8 --> 0:38:19,266
and improve
things from there.


820
0:38:19,266 --> 0:38:22,533
So with that as a segue,
let me turn to the team.


821
0:38:22,533 --> 0:38:26,667
So we have a
phenomenal team.


822
0:38:26,667 --> 0:38:28,533
So you heard the dream
team metaphor, there are


823
0:38:28,533 --> 0:38:30,2
going to be all kinds of
great metaphors coming.


824
0:38:30,2 --> 0:38:32,1
At its core what we're
really seeing is each one


825
0:38:32,1 --> 0:38:35,5
of these individuals are
successful entrepreneurs


826
0:38:35,5 --> 0:38:37,767
and successful
technologists.


827
0:38:37,767 --> 0:38:39,133
So let me
introduce them now.


828
0:38:39,133 --> 0:38:42,467
Let me start and lead
off with Clay Johnson.


829
0:38:42,467 --> 0:38:43,8
Clay, come on down!


830
0:38:43,8 --> 0:38:48,9
[applause]


831
0:38:48,9 --> 0:38:51,533
So Clay is a
successful entrepreneur.


832
0:38:51,533 --> 0:38:53,233
A founder of Blue
State Digital.


833
0:38:53,233 --> 0:38:55,233
He also is the Director
of Sunlight Labs at the


834
0:38:55,233 --> 0:38:57,533
Sunlight Foundation where
he led a community over


835
0:38:57,533 --> 0:39:2,133
2,000 developers building
apps and functionalities


836
0:39:2,133 --> 0:39:2,834
it helps to make the
government more


837
0:39:2,834 --> 0:39:4,467
open and transparent.


838
0:39:4,467 --> 0:39:5,934
He's a best
selling author.


839
0:39:5,934 --> 0:39:9,33
Recently released the
"Information Diet."


840
0:39:9,33 --> 0:39:12,533
And was, in 2009 won
Google and O'Reilly Medias


841
0:39:12,533 --> 0:39:16,967
Award for Open Source
Organizer of the Year.


842
0:39:16,967 --> 0:39:21,934
But most importantly, he
is the proud father of an


843
0:39:21,934 --> 0:39:25,667
adorable seven-week-old
Felix, who is in the


844
0:39:25,667 --> 0:39:27,33
house today. Felix?


845
0:39:27,33 --> 0:39:29,266
[cheering and appplause]


846
0:39:29,266 --> 0:39:30,3
Hey, quiet, quiet, clap


847
0:39:30,3 --> 0:39:33,1
quietly, Felix
might be asleep.


848
0:39:33,1 --> 0:39:35,233
And so when we were
thinking about what


849
0:39:35,233 --> 0:39:37,467
profile do we want in our
innovation fellows, we


850
0:39:37,467 --> 0:39:39,734
said, well, where can we
find someone who is not


851
0:39:39,734 --> 0:39:40,9
going to be sleeping for
the next six months?


852
0:39:40,9 --> 0:39:42,433
[laughter]


853
0:39:42,433 --> 0:39:45,333
Hum. So, welcome, Clay.


854
0:39:45,333 --> 0:39:47,0
Next I want to
call up Jed Wood.


855
0:39:47,0 --> 0:39:47,8
Jed, come on up.


856
0:39:47,8 --> 0:39:53,33
[applause]


857
0:39:53,33 --> 0:39:56,1
So Jed is coming in from Chicago, Illinois.


858
0:39:56,1 --> 0:39:58,7
Jed has more than ten
years of experience kind


859
0:39:58,7 --> 0:40:0,867
of merging the worlds of
design and user


860
0:40:0,867 --> 0:40:3,8
experience and programming.


861
0:40:3,8 --> 0:40:5,934
Both critically important
to this effort.


862
0:40:5,934 --> 0:40:10,8
He actually, at the
first-ever White House


863
0:40:10,8 --> 0:40:14,433
Code-A-Thon, was Top
Mention in that effort.


864
0:40:14,433 --> 0:40:17,33
Also a successful
entrepreneur, has led the


865
0:40:17,33 --> 0:40:22,1
effort or started, created
a startup called LimeChili


866
0:40:22,1 --> 0:40:24,667
that has already spun off
three different apps that


867
0:40:24,667 --> 0:40:25,6
have been acquired.


868
0:40:25,6 --> 0:40:27,433
And with a name like
LimeChili, we're going to


869
0:40:27,433 --> 0:40:30,8
turn to him as
the brand guru.


870
0:40:30,8 --> 0:40:34,3
And Jed lives in Chicago,
as I mentioned, with his


871
0:40:34,3 --> 0:40:36,266
wife and two daughters.


872
0:40:36,266 --> 0:40:39,33
To the metaphor that we
had before I only have one


873
0:40:39,33 --> 0:40:42,4
daughter who, Steve,
is 13 going on 17.


874
0:40:42,4 --> 0:40:44,934
So good luck with two!


875
0:40:44,934 --> 0:40:47,433
And then finally I would
like to call up Adam Becker.


876
0:40:47,433 --> 0:40:52,367
[applause]


877
0:40:52,367 --> 0:40:56,767
So Adam comes
in from Oakland where he is


878
0:40:56,767 --> 0:40:59,133
an avid cyclist and
lives with his two cats,


879
0:40:59,133 --> 0:41:1,4
slightly less challenging
than the two daughters,


880
0:41:1,4 --> 0:41:2,834
but we know it's work.


881
0:41:2,834 --> 0:41:5,467
So, again, another great
example of somebody who is


882
0:41:5,467 --> 0:41:8,66
a talented entrepreneur
and developer.


883
0:41:8,66 --> 0:41:12,66
He was the founder and CTO
of a company GovHub that


884
0:41:12,66 --> 0:41:15,333
focused on helping
stakeholders at the local


885
0:41:15,333 --> 0:41:17,7
level improve
communications on key


886
0:41:17,7 --> 0:41:19,667
issues of
important to them.


887
0:41:19,667 --> 0:41:24,4
Has also had a ton of web
or despite his youth or I


888
0:41:24,4 --> 0:41:26,233
should say probably
because of his youth --


889
0:41:26,233 --> 0:41:27,2
[laughter]


890
0:41:27,2 --> 0:41:29,667
-- but a ton of
web development projects


891
0:41:29,667 --> 0:41:33,133
under his belt already,
and his first website he


892
0:41:33,133 --> 0:41:38,767
ever built was for his
junior high punk rock band.


893
0:41:38,767 --> 0:41:40,8
So everybody is going to
say that their team are


894
0:41:40,8 --> 0:41:43,533
rock stars, but we have a
legitimate punk rock star


895
0:41:43,533 --> 0:41:46,166
on our team.


896
0:41:46,166 --> 0:41:46,433
So, welcome the team.


897
0:41:46,433 --> 0:41:51,1
[applause]


898
0:41:51,1 --> 0:41:52,2
And I would
also like to give a


899
0:41:52,2 --> 0:41:54,367
shout-out to Ashon Wardak
who is somewhere in the


900
0:41:54,367 --> 0:41:57,7
room who is on my team
at SBA, Ashon is also an


901
0:41:57,7 --> 0:42:0,133
entrepreneur and
technologist who is the


902
0:42:0,133 --> 0:42:4,7
point person working
with the team on RPZ-EZ.


903
0:42:4,7 --> 0:42:7,1
So quickly, here is our
game plan, here's what


904
0:42:7,1 --> 0:42:8,367
we're trying
to accomplish.


905
0:42:8,367 --> 0:42:11,5
So in the short-term we
want to walk before we can


906
0:42:11,5 --> 0:42:14,1
run so we want to focus
this effort on I.T.


907
0:42:14,1 --> 0:42:16,5
specifically and in
particular on one targeted


908
0:42:16,5 --> 0:42:18,967
sector web development.


909
0:42:18,967 --> 0:42:21,66
What we want to do in the
next six months is build


910
0:42:21,66 --> 0:42:24,3
an app and a working
alpha, let's run with a


911
0:42:24,3 --> 0:42:26,667
handful of actual
procurements through this


912
0:42:26,667 --> 0:42:28,0
process.


913
0:42:28,0 --> 0:42:30,367
Let's have some case
studies that demonstrate


914
0:42:30,367 --> 0:42:35,967
how we can save money, get better solutions for taxpayers.


915
0:42:35,967 --> 0:42:40,133
And then let's create
the blueprint to scale.


916
0:42:40,133 --> 0:42:42,633
Beyond that, what we're
trying to accomplish is


917
0:42:42,633 --> 0:42:46,166
attract new businesses
into government contracting.


918
0:42:46,166 --> 0:42:48,767
Save significant money.


919
0:42:48,767 --> 0:42:50,433
And then finally, close
that gap that I talked


920
0:42:50,433 --> 0:42:53,333
about, and Jeff Zients
talked about it at the


921
0:42:53,333 --> 0:42:56,367
beginning as well, of how
the private sector uses


922
0:42:56,367 --> 0:42:58,2
technology and
the government.


923
0:42:58,2 --> 0:43:1,767
So finally an ask to
everyone out there here's


924
0:43:1,767 --> 0:43:2,8
how you can help.


925
0:43:2,8 --> 0:43:5,333
First of all, follow us
on Twitter, you see our


926
0:43:5,333 --> 0:43:9,633
Twitter handle there or
you'll see it on the next page.


927
0:43:9,633 --> 0:43:12,4
If you're a developer,
this is all on an open platform.


928
0:43:12,4 --> 0:43:15,9
Check out what we're doing
and contribute on GitHub.


929
0:43:15,9 --> 0:43:17,333
Folks in the federal
government, if you are a


930
0:43:17,333 --> 0:43:20,333
contracting officer
we need your input.


931
0:43:20,333 --> 0:43:21,266
Kick the tires.


932
0:43:21,266 --> 0:43:23,834
Give us the feedback on
what matters to you.


933
0:43:23,834 --> 0:43:27,133
Federal buyers, come in and be a beta buyer on the platform.


934
0:43:27,133 --> 0:43:29,1
And to small businesses,
particularly in web


935
0:43:29,1 --> 0:43:31,166
development, contact us.


936
0:43:31,166 --> 0:43:33,734
We'd love to have you
participate and join.


937
0:43:33,734 --> 0:43:35,633
So that's project RFP-EZ.


938
0:43:35,633 --> 0:43:36,4
Thanks for coming.


939
0:43:36,4 --> 0:43:38,633
We look forward to your
input going forward.


940
0:43:38,633 --> 0:43:39,467
[applause]


941
0:43:39,467 --> 0:43:42,266
And again on
any of these e-mail us if


942
0:43:42,266 --> 0:43:45,4
you're interested at the
following e-mail -- sorry,


943
0:43:45,4 --> 0:43:49,233
projectRFP-EZ@SBA.gov.


944
0:43:49,233 --> 0:43:49,867
Thank you.


945
0:43:49,867 --> 0:43:55,166
[applause]


946
0:43:55,166 --> 0:43:57,433
And so now I
want to turn the mic over


947
0:43:57,433 --> 0:44:0,834
to Macon Phillips
to talk about MyGov.


948
0:44:0,834 --> 0:44:3,6
Macon is the Director of
Digital Strategy here at


949
0:44:3,6 --> 0:44:5,2
the White House.


950
0:44:5,2 --> 0:44:9,233
[applause]


951
0:44:9,233 --> 0:44:10,66
Macon Phillips:
All right.


952
0:44:10,66 --> 0:44:11,834
Welcome everyone, welcome
to the White House.


953
0:44:11,834 --> 0:44:14,734
You're getting a sense of
why sometimes we call this


954
0:44:14,734 --> 0:44:15,9
room the South
Beach Auditorium!


955
0:44:15,9 --> 0:44:18,133
[laughter]


956
0:44:18,133 --> 0:44:21,667
But I'm the halfway mark
so hang in there.


957
0:44:21,667 --> 0:44:26,4
I'm here to talk to you
about project MyGov.


958
0:44:26,4 --> 0:44:28,667
And project MyGov is an
effort to reimagine how


959
0:44:28,667 --> 0:44:30,8
citizens interact with
government through an


960
0:44:30,8 --> 0:44:34,133
experience designed around
their needs but


961
0:44:34,133 --> 0:44:36,1
not our bureaucracy.


962
0:44:36,1 --> 0:44:37,834
And to kind of give you a
sense of what I mean,


963
0:44:37,834 --> 0:44:41,133
I'm going to talk to
you about Alice.


964
0:44:41,133 --> 0:44:42,967
Just as sort of persona
we're going to use to


965
0:44:42,967 --> 0:44:47,734
illustrate this, Alice is
married, she's got two kids.


966
0:44:47,734 --> 0:44:49,834
She served in Iraq
for four years.


967
0:44:49,834 --> 0:44:50,967
She's a veteran.


968
0:44:50,967 --> 0:44:52,266
She started her
own small business.


969
0:44:52,266 --> 0:44:54,367
She is in catering.


970
0:44:54,367 --> 0:44:56,467
And she owns her own
home in my hometown of


971
0:44:56,467 --> 0:44:59,333
Huntsville, Alabama.


972
0:44:59,333 --> 0:45:0,967
There is a lot of
government information


973
0:45:0,967 --> 0:45:2,567
relevant to her.


974
0:45:2,567 --> 0:45:4,4
Of course, she goes to
the Veterans Affairs for


975
0:45:4,4 --> 0:45:6,834
information about
her benefits.


976
0:45:6,834 --> 0:45:8,1
She'll probably interact
with the Department of


977
0:45:8,1 --> 0:45:12,33
Education for information
about student loans.


978
0:45:12,33 --> 0:45:13,567
Of course, there is the
Consumer Product Safety


979
0:45:13,567 --> 0:45:15,834
Commission that is going
to help her keep tabs on


980
0:45:15,834 --> 0:45:21,767
product recalls and cribs
and all sorts of issues.


981
0:45:21,767 --> 0:45:23,333
There is the Small
Business Administration


982
0:45:23,333 --> 0:45:25,1
for information about
loans and other support


983
0:45:25,1 --> 0:45:27,333
for her business.


984
0:45:27,333 --> 0:45:28,433
And then say you have
got something like the


985
0:45:28,433 --> 0:45:30,834
Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau that is


986
0:45:30,834 --> 0:45:33,166
going to have resources
about her mortgage or a


987
0:45:33,166 --> 0:45:35,567
way for her to
file a complaint.


988
0:45:35,567 --> 0:45:38,0
She has to go to each
of these places to


989
0:45:38,0 --> 0:45:39,333
get that information.


990
0:45:39,333 --> 0:45:42,867
And sometimes, she may
not even know that these exist.


991
0:45:42,867 --> 0:45:45,3
And that is a problem.


992
0:45:45,3 --> 0:45:47,767
That is also just the
tip of the iceberg.


993
0:45:47,767 --> 0:45:50,767
The government has all
sorts of things


994
0:45:50,767 --> 0:45:51,467
relevant to her.


995
0:45:51,467 --> 0:45:53,3
They are scattered and
they are buried deep


996
0:45:53,3 --> 0:45:54,734
within this bureaucracy.


997
0:45:54,734 --> 0:45:57,266
And that is the key
question of MyGov.


998
0:45:57,266 --> 0:46:1,767
How can we identify those
things and bring them to her?


999
0:46:1,767 --> 0:46:4,633
Now, we first tried to
tackle this problem with


1000
0:46:4,633 --> 0:46:8,166
FIRSTGOV, which whose
mission was to provide the


1001
0:46:8,166 --> 0:46:10,5
public with easy one stop
access for all federal


1002
0:46:10,5 --> 0:46:12,1
information and services.


1003
0:46:12,1 --> 0:46:13,7
And I think twelve years
later we can all agree


1004
0:46:13,7 --> 0:46:16,734
that FIRSTGOV was
certainly not the last dot gov.


1005
0:46:16,734 --> 0:46:19,266
But that is not to say
that websites are bad.


1006
0:46:19,266 --> 0:46:21,33
We have actually had some
really great examples of


1007
0:46:21,33 --> 0:46:23,1
websites in the
last few years.


1008
0:46:23,1 --> 0:46:26,2
Take the recent student
aid.gov that education


1009
0:46:26,2 --> 0:46:27,333
just put out.


1010
0:46:27,333 --> 0:46:30,166
It is a great example of
user centric design that


1011
0:46:30,166 --> 0:46:31,767
helps people find the
right student aid


1012
0:46:31,767 --> 0:46:34,433
resources based
on their needs.


1013
0:46:34,433 --> 0:46:37,3
Of course you have
got Health Care.Gov.


1014
0:46:37,3 --> 0:46:39,934
Which for the first time
you can find all of your


1015
0:46:39,934 --> 0:46:41,5
public and private health
care coverage options in


1016
0:46:41,5 --> 0:46:43,266
the same place.


1017
0:46:43,266 --> 0:46:45,967
And it too is
built around users.


1018
0:46:45,967 --> 0:46:47,567
Or Consumer Finance.Gov.


1019
0:46:47,567 --> 0:46:50,133
Here is a site for the
Consumer Financial


1020
0:46:50,133 --> 0:46:52,1
Protection Bureau that
offers a range of


1021
0:46:52,1 --> 0:46:55,266
resources to make, to
empower consumers and also


1022
0:46:55,266 --> 0:46:58,6
a way for them to
file complaints.


1023
0:46:58,6 --> 0:47:1,367
Each offers powerful
tools to the user.


1024
0:47:1,367 --> 0:47:3,567
And each is organized
around a regular person,


1025
0:47:3,567 --> 0:47:5,367
not a subject
matter expert.


1026
0:47:5,367 --> 0:47:9,7
With that said, there is
still more we can do.


1027
0:47:9,7 --> 0:47:11,834
These are three distinct
sites produced


1028
0:47:11,834 --> 0:47:13,533
by different agencies.


1029
0:47:13,533 --> 0:47:15,667
And although Alice might
end up at Student Aid.Gov


1030
0:47:15,667 --> 0:47:18,5
with her kid, researching
college affordability


1031
0:47:18,5 --> 0:47:20,166
options, she might not
know about some of the


1032
0:47:20,166 --> 0:47:23,433
benefits relevant to her
at Health Care.Gov or that


1033
0:47:23,433 --> 0:47:25,166
she can actually get help
with her mortgage at


1034
0:47:25,166 --> 0:47:27,0
Consumer Finance.Gov.


1035
0:47:27,0 --> 0:47:29,333
There is not an efficient
super structure across the


1036
0:47:29,333 --> 0:47:32,367
federal web space to help
her discover these things.


1037
0:47:32,367 --> 0:47:33,967
And of course as I said
earlier this is the


1038
0:47:33,967 --> 0:47:36,33
tip of the iceberg.


1039
0:47:36,33 --> 0:47:37,467
The web has brought
incredible efficiency to the


1040
0:47:37,467 --> 0:47:39,6
relationship between
government and citizens.


1041
0:47:39,6 --> 0:47:41,233
You can pay taxes
in your pajamas.


1042
0:47:41,233 --> 0:47:43,834
You can go research energy
efficient light bulbs or


1043
0:47:43,834 --> 0:47:46,8
laundry machines
at Energy Star.Gov.


1044
0:47:46,8 --> 0:47:51,266
You can even track
a robot on Mars.


1045
0:47:51,266 --> 0:47:52,633
All right.


1046
0:47:52,633 --> 0:47:53,6
So there is a NASA fan.


1047
0:47:53,6 --> 0:47:54,934
[laughter]


1048
0:47:54,934 --> 0:47:56,33
All right.


1049
0:47:56,33 --> 0:47:58,667
There is a lot to discover
and shifting that burden


1050
0:47:58,667 --> 0:48:0,8
from the citizen back to
the government is what we


1051
0:48:0,8 --> 0:48:2,2
are trying to do here.


1052
0:48:2,2 --> 0:48:3,8
But back to Alice.


1053
0:48:3,8 --> 0:48:6,734
I want to stress that we
are not here to create yet


1054
0:48:6,734 --> 0:48:9,734
another website that
Alice has to remember.


1055
0:48:9,734 --> 0:48:11,567
MyGov is a service that
goes out into the federal


1056
0:48:11,567 --> 0:48:14,166
bureaucracy, identifies
the information and


1057
0:48:14,166 --> 0:48:17,33
services relevant to
her based on her needs.


1058
0:48:17,33 --> 0:48:20,9
Brings that together into
a personalized experience


1059
0:48:20,9 --> 0:48:23,66
and that we can present
perhaps through it's own


1060
0:48:23,66 --> 0:48:25,4
stand alone dashboard or
perhaps in the contexts of


1061
0:48:25,4 --> 0:48:27,9
sites that she is
already visiting.


1062
0:48:27,9 --> 0:48:29,7
And this is a pretty
big challenge.


1063
0:48:29,7 --> 0:48:33,3
But the good news is, it
is building on momentum


1064
0:48:33,3 --> 0:48:33,967
that is already out there.


1065
0:48:33,967 --> 0:48:36,533
Of course, we have got
USA.gov, which does, has


1066
0:48:36,533 --> 0:48:37,8
done incredible work
laying down the groundwork


1067
0:48:37,8 --> 0:48:40,233
for how we organize
information around topics


1068
0:48:40,233 --> 0:48:42,0
rather than bureaucracy.


1069
0:48:42,0 --> 0:48:43,934
And I am sure many of
you have heard about our


1070
0:48:43,934 --> 0:48:46,8
colleagues across the pond
at the government, United


1071
0:48:46,8 --> 0:48:48,266
Kingdoms Government
Digital Service that have


1072
0:48:48,266 --> 0:48:52,166
made some remarkable
achievements with Gov.UK.


1073
0:48:52,166 --> 0:48:54,166
Now, both of these makes
search a central part of


1074
0:48:54,166 --> 0:48:55,767
their strategy and that is
going to serve as a key


1075
0:48:55,767 --> 0:48:58,767
component of ours
moving forward.


1076
0:48:58,767 --> 0:49:2,2
But our bigger picture is truly a no wrong door approach.


1077
0:49:2,2 --> 0:49:4,3
Where every federal touch
point participates in this


1078
0:49:4,3 --> 0:49:7,133
agency agnostic people
centered service.


1079
0:49:7,133 --> 0:49:9,967
And we are not just
solving for today.


1080
0:49:9,967 --> 0:49:12,734
This approach also allows
us to add a new dimension


1081
0:49:12,734 --> 0:49:17,0
as people's information
and needs change over time.


1082
0:49:17,0 --> 0:49:19,66
Imagine if Alice creates a
custom profile focused on


1083
0:49:19,66 --> 0:49:21,5
her interest, one that
enables notifications and


1084
0:49:21,5 --> 0:49:25,433
alert, if contents she saw
yesterday changes tomorrow


1085
0:49:25,433 --> 0:49:28,633
like a new product recall
or veterans benefit.


1086
0:49:28,633 --> 0:49:31,533
So what is this
going to look like?


1087
0:49:31,533 --> 0:49:33,433
In one month we are
planning to have a basic


1088
0:49:33,433 --> 0:49:35,7
prototype of the
MyGov platform.


1089
0:49:35,7 --> 0:49:38,533
In three months, define
this basic persona


1090
0:49:38,533 --> 0:49:41,4
standards for personalizing services and information.


1091
0:49:41,4 --> 0:49:43,233
And in six months have
at least two important


1092
0:49:43,233 --> 0:49:45,567
citizen and government
interactions using the


1093
0:49:45,567 --> 0:49:47,934
platform and a
personalized notification


1094
0:49:47,934 --> 0:49:51,567
center for government
services and information.


1095
0:49:51,567 --> 0:49:52,5
Now, this is the fun part.


1096
0:49:52,5 --> 0:49:54,0
Let's talk about who
is going to do it.


1097
0:49:54,0 --> 0:49:56,433
Kara. Come on up.


1098
0:49:56,433 --> 0:50:5,6
[applause]


1099
0:50:5,6 --> 0:50:7,567
Kara DeFrias'
enthusiasm for creating


1100
0:50:7,567 --> 0:50:9,433
great experiences is
contagious whether she is


1101
0:50:9,433 --> 0:50:11,6
working on the Oscars,
with the Gold Medal


1102
0:50:11,6 --> 0:50:13,934
winning US Women's Soccer team


1103
0:50:13,934 --> 0:50:15,367
[applause]


1104
0:50:15,367 --> 0:50:17,166
Or taxes.


1105
0:50:17,166 --> 0:50:19,1
[laughter]


1106
0:50:19,1 --> 0:50:21,0
At Turbo Tax,
we got her to come here


1107
0:50:21,0 --> 0:50:23,433
all the way from San Diego
to work with us on making


1108
0:50:23,433 --> 0:50:25,7
user experiences awesome
which if you ever paid


1109
0:50:25,7 --> 0:50:27,667
your taxes, you can
understand how it could


1110
0:50:27,667 --> 0:50:28,6
not be awesome.


1111
0:50:28,6 --> 0:50:30,633
But she knows, she knows
how to get it done.


1112
0:50:30,633 --> 0:50:32,734
This three time cancer
survivor has got a knack


1113
0:50:32,734 --> 0:50:34,9
for speaking to user in
their language, tapping


1114
0:50:34,9 --> 0:50:37,767
into their emotions, and
relentlessly pushes for


1115
0:50:37,767 --> 0:50:39,567
what is best for them.


1116
0:50:39,567 --> 0:50:40,867
Phil. All right.


1117
0:50:40,867 --> 0:50:45,767
[applause]


1118
0:50:45,767 --> 0:50:47,333
Phil Ashlock
is steeped in the open


1119
0:50:47,333 --> 0:50:49,266
government community from
years building open source


1120
0:50:49,266 --> 0:50:51,934
civic infrastructure at
Open Plans and sharing it


1121
0:50:51,934 --> 0:50:53,533
through Civic Commons.


1122
0:50:53,533 --> 0:50:55,5
As a primary instigator
behind the Community


1123
0:50:55,5 --> 0:50:57,9
Driven Open 311
Initiative, a service up


1124
0:50:57,9 --> 0:50:59,834
and running in a lot of
cities including this one,


1125
0:50:59,834 --> 0:51:3,1
Washington, D.C., he has
created, he has helped a


1126
0:51:3,1 --> 0:51:5,467
complete a common platform
for citizen services that


1127
0:51:5,467 --> 0:51:7,6
is revolutionizing the
way people interact with


1128
0:51:7,6 --> 0:51:9,2
government
around the world.


1129
0:51:9,2 --> 0:51:10,934
He has got a gift for
bringing people together


1130
0:51:10,934 --> 0:51:14,533
to solve complex
challenges. Ben.


1131
0:51:14,533 --> 0:51:15,433
All right.


1132
0:51:15,433 --> 0:51:17,0
Ben Balter everyone.


1133
0:51:17,0 --> 0:51:20,0
[applause]


1134
0:51:20,0 --> 0:51:20,633
All right, man.


1135
0:51:20,633 --> 0:51:22,1
This guy is lightning
in a bottle.


1136
0:51:22,1 --> 0:51:24,1
He is the kind of guy
that has been hacking


1137
0:51:24,1 --> 0:51:26,0
government from the inside
out already at places like


1138
0:51:26,0 --> 0:51:27,867
the CFPB, the Consumer
Financial Protection


1139
0:51:27,867 --> 0:51:29,533
Bureau, and FCC.


1140
0:51:29,533 --> 0:51:32,0
All the while pursuing
degrees in law and business.


1141
0:51:32,0 --> 0:51:33,66
Obviously, an
under achiever.


1142
0:51:33,66 --> 0:51:35,233
[laughter]


1143
0:51:35,233 --> 0:51:36,9
Danny,
come on up.


1144
0:51:36,9 --> 0:51:38,333
All right.


1145
0:51:38,333 --> 0:51:40,967
[applause]


1146
0:51:40,967 --> 0:51:42,6
So Danny Chapman
brings his award


1147
0:51:42,6 --> 0:51:44,166
winning design shops and
recent work at Rhode


1148
0:51:44,166 --> 0:51:47,8
Island's RI.Gov among
many other sites.


1149
0:51:47,8 --> 0:51:51,533
And he has got that rare
intersection of experience


1150
0:51:51,533 --> 0:51:54,1
with both design, but
also empathy for user


1151
0:51:54,1 --> 0:51:57,66
experience with
government services.


1152
0:51:57,66 --> 0:51:59,233
And finally we
have got Greg.


1153
0:51:59,233 --> 0:52:2,967
[applause]


1154
0:52:2,967 --> 0:52:4,734
All right.


1155
0:52:4,734 --> 0:52:6,834
So Greg has made a career
of creating products that


1156
0:52:6,834 --> 0:52:9,0
make information
more accessible.


1157
0:52:9,0 --> 0:52:10,9
Most recently he was on
the core team developing


1158
0:52:10,9 --> 0:52:13,633
USA Search Platform and
his idea of relaxing with


1159
0:52:13,633 --> 0:52:16,1
a movie is building a
custom application to


1160
0:52:16,1 --> 0:52:19,433
search I Tunes, Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu for the best options.


1161
0:52:19,433 --> 0:52:20,166
[laughter]


1162
0:52:20,166 --> 0:52:20,9
It is out there.


1163
0:52:20,9 --> 0:52:22,7
It is Cinidex.come
with an I.


1164
0:52:22,7 --> 0:52:25,433
Right. All right.
Cinidex with an I.


1165
0:52:25,433 --> 0:52:28,233
So any way we are looking
for ideas from everyone.


1166
0:52:28,233 --> 0:52:31,3
For example, are you
an expert in privacy?


1167
0:52:31,3 --> 0:52:33,33
We want, we want
to talk to you.


1168
0:52:33,33 --> 0:52:35,66
Providing a level of
personalization requires


1169
0:52:35,66 --> 0:52:37,0
knowing something
about that person.


1170
0:52:37,0 --> 0:52:39,233
And this must be handled
with a strong emphasis on


1171
0:52:39,233 --> 0:52:42,667
user permission, control,
and transparency.


1172
0:52:42,667 --> 0:52:45,3
Have you had experience
developing platforms like this?


1173
0:52:45,3 --> 0:52:46,333
We want to connect.


1174
0:52:46,333 --> 0:52:48,433
The bottom line is that
even though this project


1175
0:52:48,433 --> 0:52:50,8
is called MyGov, the
challenge is all of ours.


1176
0:52:50,8 --> 0:52:53,3
Yours, mine, and Alice's.


1177
0:52:53,3 --> 0:52:55,266
And we cannot wait
to get to work.


1178
0:52:55,266 --> 0:52:56,5
So thank you everyone.


1179
0:52:56,5 --> 0:53:0,767
[applause]


1180
0:53:0,767 --> 0:53:2,6
All right. All right.


1181
0:53:2,6 --> 0:53:5,367
And now I am going to
introduce Maura O'Neill,


1182
0:53:5,367 --> 0:53:6,967
who is the Chief
Innovation Officer at


1183
0:53:6,967 --> 0:53:9,9
USAID, Maura?


1184
0:53:9,9 --> 0:53:11,266
Maura O'Neill:
Thanks so much.


1185
0:53:11,266 --> 0:53:13,233
Thanks so much, Macon.


1186
0:53:13,233 --> 0:53:15,33
Hi, I am happy to be here.


1187
0:53:15,33 --> 0:53:17,333
And so excited to share
this platform with these


1188
0:53:17,333 --> 0:53:20,233
amazing Presidential
Innovation Fellows and the


1189
0:53:20,233 --> 0:53:22,567
awesome people that I get
a chance to work with in


1190
0:53:22,567 --> 0:53:24,0
this administration.


1191
0:53:24,0 --> 0:53:26,533
As Macon said, my name is
Maura O'Neill and I joined


1192
0:53:26,533 --> 0:53:29,233
administrator Raj
Shah three years ago.


1193
0:53:29,233 --> 0:53:34,33
At AID, the US Agency for
International Development.


1194
0:53:34,33 --> 0:53:37,4
USAID's development work
is a key component of our


1195
0:53:37,4 --> 0:53:40,767
foreign policy along side
with the defense work that


1196
0:53:40,767 --> 0:53:43,9
our military does and the
diplomacy work that our


1197
0:53:43,9 --> 0:53:47,367
state does, our State
Department does.


1198
0:53:47,367 --> 0:53:50,233
We know that our economic
prosperity at home and our


1199
0:53:50,233 --> 0:53:54,266
own national security is
at risk when one third of


1200
0:53:54,266 --> 0:53:57,233
the people in the world
live in extreme poverty


1201
0:53:57,233 --> 0:53:59,633
and a million more
live under oppressive


1202
0:53:59,633 --> 0:54:3,166
governments for which they
don't have a hope to build


1203
0:54:3,166 --> 0:54:5,934
a better life for their,
or their children.


1204
0:54:5,934 --> 0:54:8,2
Development as President
Obama and Secretary


1205
0:54:8,2 --> 0:54:11,567
Clinton note is essential
to advancing American


1206
0:54:11,567 --> 0:54:15,3
interests and solving
global security problems


1207
0:54:15,3 --> 0:54:17,767
as diplomacy in defense.


1208
0:54:17,767 --> 0:54:21,467
Our job at USAID is to
reduce that risk by being


1209
0:54:21,467 --> 0:54:24,567
relentlessly focused
on finding ways


1210
0:54:24,567 --> 0:54:26,834
to deliver results.


1211
0:54:26,834 --> 0:54:29,7
Faster and more efficient
than traditional development.


1212
0:54:29,7 --> 0:54:33,7
And humanitarian
assistance has done.


1213
0:54:33,7 --> 0:54:36,7
So come back with me to
that first week of work


1214
0:54:36,7 --> 0:54:38,667
that Raj and I were at.


1215
0:54:38,667 --> 0:54:42,967
It was Wednesday, it
was late afternoon.


1216
0:54:42,967 --> 0:54:45,7
And across, flashed across
our screens the


1217
0:54:45,7 --> 0:54:48,133
Haiti Earthquake. 7.0.


1218
0:54:48,133 --> 0:54:55,1
Turns out it ends up being
the most, the largest


1219
0:54:55,1 --> 0:54:57,734
urban disaster in
modern history.


1220
0:54:57,734 --> 0:55:0,333
It effected a third
of the population.


1221
0:55:0,333 --> 0:55:3,333
And it claimed all, nearly
a quarter of a million


1222
0:55:3,333 --> 0:55:4,734
peoples lives.


1223
0:55:4,734 --> 0:55:7,367
Since it was dusk, it
would be morning before we


1224
0:55:7,367 --> 0:55:9,3
could assess the damage.


1225
0:55:9,3 --> 0:55:11,433
Could we land planes?


1226
0:55:11,433 --> 0:55:12,4
Could we dock ships?


1227
0:55:12,4 --> 0:55:14,7
How were we going to
get help down there?


1228
0:55:14,7 --> 0:55:16,266
We worked all night.


1229
0:55:16,266 --> 0:55:18,266
It was the first of many.


1230
0:55:18,266 --> 0:55:20,433
We worked in lock step
with other US government


1231
0:55:20,433 --> 0:55:24,9
agencies and our
military to help Haiti.


1232
0:55:24,9 --> 0:55:28,7
The earthquake left a
government in rubble, an


1233
0:55:28,7 --> 0:55:31,834
economy in shambles and
people living in make


1234
0:55:31,834 --> 0:55:35,934
shift camps coping
with enormous loss.


1235
0:55:35,934 --> 0:55:38,767
It also caused
a cash crisis.


1236
0:55:38,767 --> 0:55:40,9
The earthquake destroyed
nearly a third of all of


1237
0:55:40,9 --> 0:55:45,633
the branch, bank
branches, and the ATM's.


1238
0:55:45,633 --> 0:55:49,2
But for over 90 percent of
the Haitians, who didn't


1239
0:55:49,2 --> 0:55:50,433
have access to either
one of those before the


1240
0:55:50,433 --> 0:55:53,266
earthquake, their life
savings went down


1241
0:55:53,266 --> 0:55:54,333
with their house.


1242
0:55:54,333 --> 0:55:58,767
Their cash was buried
hopelessly under thousands


1243
0:55:58,767 --> 0:56:1,5
and thousands of
pounds of rubble.


1244
0:56:1,5 --> 0:56:7,4
So here they were with no ability to actually buy anything.


1245
0:56:7,4 --> 0:56:9,8
So imagine for a minute,
what it meant if your


1246
0:56:9,8 --> 0:56:13,266
savings were wiped
out in a second.


1247
0:56:13,266 --> 0:56:15,767
Walk with me and walk with
the people in Haiti for a


1248
0:56:15,767 --> 0:56:19,834
second as we put
ourselves in their shoes.


1249
0:56:19,834 --> 0:56:21,967
Their house has been
destroyed, a loved one has


1250
0:56:21,967 --> 0:56:25,633
probably been killed,
everything around you


1251
0:56:25,633 --> 0:56:27,533
seems to have crumbled.


1252
0:56:27,533 --> 0:56:30,1
And because your entire
life's worth is your


1253
0:56:30,1 --> 0:56:32,266
assets and your cash,
has been swept away


1254
0:56:32,266 --> 0:56:33,867
with the destruction.


1255
0:56:33,867 --> 0:56:35,767
You have no ability
to buy food.


1256
0:56:35,767 --> 0:56:37,633
You have no ability
to buy water.


1257
0:56:37,633 --> 0:56:40,166
And you have no ability
to buy any supplies to


1258
0:56:40,166 --> 0:56:42,4
rebuild your house.


1259
0:56:42,4 --> 0:56:45,767
This cash crisis was one
of the least understood


1260
0:56:45,767 --> 0:56:49,867
but hugely damaging
effects of the earthquake.


1261
0:56:49,867 --> 0:56:53,0
I often think about this
story and think how lucky


1262
0:56:53,0 --> 0:56:57,0
you and I are to live in
a place that has a safe


1263
0:56:57,0 --> 0:57:0,433
place to store our money.


1264
0:57:0,433 --> 0:57:3,333
At AID, we know that
financial inclusion and


1265
0:57:3,333 --> 0:57:6,66
financial infrastructure
is critical for families


1266
0:57:6,66 --> 0:57:7,967
and economies to grow.


1267
0:57:7,967 --> 0:57:12,633
In our, in Haiti, where
mobile phones were the


1268
0:57:12,633 --> 0:57:14,734
only thing left standing
at the end of this


1269
0:57:14,734 --> 0:57:18,967
earthquake, we thought
what if we could turn


1270
0:57:18,967 --> 0:57:20,133
every phone into a wallet?


1271
0:57:20,133 --> 0:57:21,734
A cash register?


1272
0:57:21,734 --> 0:57:23,667
A bank branch?


1273
0:57:23,667 --> 0:57:26,233
President Obama had
challenged us to create a


1274
0:57:26,233 --> 0:57:29,967
world in which AID and aid
is no longer necessary.


1275
0:57:29,967 --> 0:57:33,133
This was the kind of game
changing innovation that


1276
0:57:33,133 --> 0:57:35,633
was going to be necessary.


1277
0:57:35,633 --> 0:57:38,9
Priya Jaisinghani and I,
she is the Director of our


1278
0:57:38,9 --> 0:57:42,967
Mobile Solutions Team at
USAID, lead an effort with


1279
0:57:42,967 --> 0:57:45,367
the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation.


1280
0:57:45,367 --> 0:57:48,967
The USAID Haiti office and
local companies to build a


1281
0:57:48,967 --> 0:57:51,266
mobile monies platform
in Haiti months


1282
0:57:51,266 --> 0:57:53,333
after the earthquake.


1283
0:57:53,333 --> 0:57:56,233
I was in Haiti just last
month and excited to tell


1284
0:57:56,233 --> 0:57:57,767
you about the progress.


1285
0:57:57,767 --> 0:58:0,767
The Haitians celebrated
the five millionth mobile


1286
0:58:0,767 --> 0:58:3,533
money transaction in
less than two years.


1287
0:58:3,533 --> 0:58:5,633
So we have a long way
to go in rebuilding the


1288
0:58:5,633 --> 0:58:8,166
country and people
rebuilding their lives,


1289
0:58:8,166 --> 0:58:10,433
but we have a financial
infrastructure that is


1290
0:58:10,433 --> 0:58:12,266
beginning to work.


1291
0:58:12,266 --> 0:58:14,834
To better explain why this
is important and what it


1292
0:58:14,834 --> 0:58:19,7
means, let me introduce
you to -- so this is what


1293
0:58:19,7 --> 0:58:23,333
a lot of the ATM's and
bank branches look like


1294
0:58:23,333 --> 0:58:25,9
the day after
the earthquake.


1295
0:58:25,9 --> 0:58:28,8
So let me introduce
you to Martine.


1296
0:58:28,8 --> 0:58:31,1
Before the earth -- after
the earthquake she had to


1297
0:58:31,1 --> 0:58:34,1
move 75 miles north of
Port Au Prince to live


1298
0:58:34,1 --> 0:58:35,3
with her family.


1299
0:58:35,3 --> 0:58:37,467
Taking only what
she could carry.


1300
0:58:37,467 --> 0:58:39,867
She made a living by
selling food, soaps,


1301
0:58:39,867 --> 0:58:43,33
sponges, and other
miscellaneous items.


1302
0:58:43,33 --> 0:58:45,333
She made a few dollars
here and there.


1303
0:58:45,333 --> 0:58:47,2
But she didn't have
anywhere to put it.


1304
0:58:47,2 --> 0:58:49,266
She carried around
a bag of cash,


1305
0:58:49,266 --> 0:58:51,166
she stuffed it in her clothes.


1306
0:58:51,166 --> 0:58:53,133
But she lived in
a state of fear.


1307
0:58:53,133 --> 0:58:56,433
Worrying every day that
a thief or a stranger or


1308
0:58:56,433 --> 0:59:0,834
maybe somebody that had a
little less than her would


1309
0:59:0,834 --> 0:59:3,467
steal that sum of
money from her.


1310
0:59:3,467 --> 0:59:6,767
This began to change when
Martine participated in


1311
0:59:6,767 --> 0:59:9,8
one of USAID programs
with Mercy Corp.


1312
0:59:9,8 --> 0:59:12,867
She learned how to use
mobile money and she sent


1313
0:59:12,867 --> 0:59:16,233
it back and forth with her
family in Port Au Prince.


1314
0:59:16,233 --> 0:59:18,533
As a result of the
training she received, she


1315
0:59:18,533 --> 0:59:21,8
decided to start using
mobile money in her business.


1316
0:59:21,8 --> 0:59:24,233
To more efficiently
collect fees, to deposit


1317
0:59:24,233 --> 0:59:26,767
her money in the bank,
and for her products.


1318
0:59:26,767 --> 0:59:30,834
Just like we use credit
cards in our businesses today.


1319
0:59:30,834 --> 0:59:33,133
Martine told us that
mobile money is like


1320
0:59:33,133 --> 0:59:35,834
a safe for me.


1321
0:59:35,834 --> 0:59:37,7
Like a safe,
it makes Martine feel


1322
0:59:37,7 --> 0:59:40,1
secure and empowered.


1323
0:59:40,1 --> 0:59:42,467
Like a safe, it keeps
money close so Martine


1324
0:59:42,467 --> 0:59:45,1
doesn't have to
travel to a bank.


1325
0:59:45,1 --> 0:59:47,433
And like a safe, it
enables Martine to grow


1326
0:59:47,433 --> 0:59:50,166
her business and
support her future.


1327
0:59:50,166 --> 0:59:53,533
Martine's story is not
that unique in Haiti.


1328
0:59:53,533 --> 0:59:56,1
And electronic payments
won't solve all


1329
0:59:56,1 --> 0:59:57,6
of her problems.


1330
0:59:57,6 --> 1:0:0,834
But it is helping
her in profound ways.


1331
1:0:0,834 --> 1:0:2,967
If you only remember three
things from this talk


1332
1:0:2,967 --> 1:0:6,734
today, I want you to
remember that electronic


1333
1:0:6,734 --> 1:0:10,66
payments reduce
transaction costs, they


1334
1:0:10,66 --> 1:0:12,4
reduce corruption and
violence, and they enable


1335
1:0:12,4 --> 1:0:14,367
businesses to grow.


1336
1:0:14,367 --> 1:0:16,8
And these are the
conditions necessary if


1337
1:0:16,8 --> 1:0:22,333
donors to create a world
where donors are not needed.


1338
1:0:22,333 --> 1:0:25,333
Now think about the
US for a moment.


1339
1:0:25,333 --> 1:0:28,233
The industrial revolution
wouldn't have happened


1340
1:0:28,233 --> 1:0:31,266
without thriving
commercial banks like Bank


1341
1:0:31,266 --> 1:0:33,6
of America, Wells Fargo,
and thousands of community


1342
1:0:33,6 --> 1:0:36,0
banks around the US.


1343
1:0:36,0 --> 1:0:38,7
EBay might not have been
the eBay powerhouse that


1344
1:0:38,7 --> 1:0:41,4
we know today if it
weren't for Pay Pal.


1345
1:0:41,4 --> 1:0:44,233
Our economy depends on
the ability to send and


1346
1:0:44,233 --> 1:0:46,7
receive monies seamlessly.


1347
1:0:46,7 --> 1:0:49,2
Your livelihood and mine
depend on the ability to


1348
1:0:49,2 --> 1:0:53,667
save, invest money, and
use credit and debt cards


1349
1:0:53,667 --> 1:0:55,567
in your wallet.


1350
1:0:55,567 --> 1:0:57,834
But we also know that
this kind of thing


1351
1:0:57,834 --> 1:0:59,133
just doesn't happen.


1352
1:0:59,133 --> 1:1:1,9
Think back to the history
of the credit card.


1353
1:1:1,9 --> 1:1:4,7
It actually took 50 years
for the credit cards to


1354
1:1:4,7 --> 1:1:7,567
really become
ubiquitous in the US.


1355
1:1:7,567 --> 1:1:9,734
People didn't trust credit
cards, at least they


1356
1:1:9,734 --> 1:1:12,0
didn't know whether they
should trust credit cards.


1357
1:1:12,0 --> 1:1:14,934
Not enough
merchants took it.


1358
1:1:14,934 --> 1:1:18,233
But we don't have 50 years
to wait to get people out


1359
1:1:18,233 --> 1:1:20,633
of extreme poverty and
create new markets for


1360
1:1:20,633 --> 1:1:23,667
American products.


1361
1:1:23,667 --> 1:1:27,4
So let's see what is
happening around the world.


1362
1:1:27,4 --> 1:1:30,533
The technology exists,
the innovation payments


1363
1:1:30,533 --> 1:1:32,433
platform exist.


1364
1:1:32,433 --> 1:1:36,6
And here is a picture of
the place in the world


1365
1:1:36,6 --> 1:1:39,5
that this is
happening so well.


1366
1:1:39,5 --> 1:1:40,767
And that is Kenya.


1367
1:1:40,767 --> 1:1:43,233
And we are honored to have
the ambassador to the US


1368
1:1:43,233 --> 1:1:45,567
from Kenya joining
us here to today.


1369
1:1:45,567 --> 1:1:49,633
Kenya's M-Pesa mobile
money product, 80 percent


1370
1:1:49,633 --> 1:1:52,0
of Kenyan adults use it
as a way to store


1371
1:1:52,0 --> 1:1:53,367
and transfer money.


1372
1:1:53,367 --> 1:1:55,633
And they have done this
in just five years.


1373
1:1:55,633 --> 1:1:57,233
Not 50 years.


1374
1:1:57,233 --> 1:1:59,467
80 percent of the
adults are using it.


1375
1:1:59,467 --> 1:2:1,433
But this is one of the
few platforms to


1376
1:2:1,433 --> 1:2:3,367
reach mass scale.


1377
1:2:3,367 --> 1:2:5,667
There is about 130
deployments of mobile


1378
1:2:5,667 --> 1:2:8,6
money and electronic
platforms world wide that


1379
1:2:8,6 --> 1:2:9,533
are stalled.


1380
1:2:9,533 --> 1:2:11,467
They are stalled for
various reasons.


1381
1:2:11,467 --> 1:2:13,5
But in large part they are
stalled, because there


1382
1:2:13,5 --> 1:2:17,633
aren't any anchor tenants
to this mobile money platform.


1383
1:2:17,633 --> 1:2:19,333
They are -- it is
a network effect.


1384
1:2:19,333 --> 1:2:22,1
There needs to be huge
volumes of transactions to


1385
1:2:22,1 --> 1:2:25,1
support the kinds of
agents on every corner


1386
1:2:25,1 --> 1:2:27,333
just like there was to
have an ATM machine


1387
1:2:27,333 --> 1:2:28,6
on every corner.


1388
1:2:28,6 --> 1:2:32,367
So we need to and can jump
start these efforts to


1389
1:2:32,367 --> 1:2:35,967
find these anchor tenants
for that mobile money mall.


1390
1:2:35,967 --> 1:2:38,967
Until today, cash was
the only alternative.


1391
1:2:38,967 --> 1:2:41,2
And for those of us who
live in the US, it seems


1392
1:2:41,2 --> 1:2:44,433
pretty easy, we go to
the ATM, we get cash.


1393
1:2:44,433 --> 1:2:47,133
We don't put our lives at
risk as we are storing our


1394
1:2:47,133 --> 1:2:52,4
money in our pockets or
have, or have to use our


1395
1:2:52,4 --> 1:2:55,934
credit cards to actually
buy things that are remote.


1396
1:2:55,934 --> 1:2:58,667
But at this unique moment
in history when technology


1397
1:2:58,667 --> 1:3:0,867
allows us to envision a
world where everybody can


1398
1:3:0,867 --> 1:3:4,2
soon keep their money
electronically, safely,


1399
1:3:4,2 --> 1:3:6,333
soundly and together build
a better and stronger


1400
1:3:6,333 --> 1:3:9,66
economy, that is
what we are about.


1401
1:3:9,66 --> 1:3:13,166
So I am so excited to
launch the 20 Percent


1402
1:3:13,166 --> 1:3:14,7
Initiative today.


1403
1:3:14,7 --> 1:3:17,834
Which aims to reduce 20
percent of the cost with


1404
1:3:17,834 --> 1:3:21,4
cash based programs across
the US government and put


1405
1:3:21,4 --> 1:3:23,4
these tools in the hands
of the poorest people


1406
1:3:23,4 --> 1:3:24,767
in the world.


1407
1:3:24,767 --> 1:3:28,8
At USAID we are proud that
we have taken bold steps


1408
1:3:28,8 --> 1:3:31,166
to motivate a change in
the way our partners and


1409
1:3:31,166 --> 1:3:32,834
we do business.


1410
1:3:32,834 --> 1:3:34,8
We continue to use our
budget as a force for


1411
1:3:34,8 --> 1:3:37,867
good, creating incentives
that encourage partners to


1412
1:3:37,867 --> 1:3:40,133
implement new
payment methods.


1413
1:3:40,133 --> 1:3:42,633
The Catholic Relief
Services in Haiti when


1414
1:3:42,633 --> 1:3:45,8
they instituted paying
their salaries through


1415
1:3:45,8 --> 1:3:49,1
mobile money, reduced
their administrative costs


1416
1:3:49,1 --> 1:3:50,633
by 60 percent.


1417
1:3:50,633 --> 1:3:54,266
So we think that
20 percent is a,


1418
1:3:54,266 --> 1:3:55,667
is a huge goal.


1419
1:3:55,667 --> 1:3:59,3
But you know, we have an
awesome set of other teams


1420
1:3:59,3 --> 1:4:1,934
here and we have got to
beat them on some metrics.


1421
1:4:1,934 --> 1:4:5,66
And Shawn released his
data today, so we can't


1422
1:4:5,66 --> 1:4:6,233
actually do that.


1423
1:4:6,233 --> 1:4:11,166
So we think that 20
percent is, is a great goal.


1424
1:4:11,166 --> 1:4:15,66
But we also as
aspire to do higher.


1425
1:4:15,66 --> 1:4:17,3
We are prouder still that
the White House wants to


1426
1:4:17,3 --> 1:4:20,233
expand this initiative
across the US government.


1427
1:4:20,233 --> 1:4:21,667
Like the Department
Of Defense.


1428
1:4:21,667 --> 1:4:24,633
Which has said it needs to
get cash off of the battle


1429
1:4:24,633 --> 1:4:28,0
field to keep our
soldiers safe.


1430
1:4:28,0 --> 1:4:31,266
In Afghanistan where
police officers began to


1431
1:4:31,266 --> 1:4:33,867
get paid through mobile
money instead of a series


1432
1:4:33,867 --> 1:4:36,867
of cash payments, they
discovered that they had a


1433
1:4:36,867 --> 1:4:38,633
30 percent raise.


1434
1:4:38,633 --> 1:4:40,7
They thought they got that
actually from the


1435
1:4:40,7 --> 1:4:42,0
mobile money company.


1436
1:4:42,0 --> 1:4:44,0
But in fact that was
actually the amount of


1437
1:4:44,0 --> 1:4:46,767
sticky fingers that were
happening from the time


1438
1:4:46,767 --> 1:4:49,6
the cash was deployed to
the time they got it


1439
1:4:49,6 --> 1:4:50,8
in their hands.


1440
1:4:50,8 --> 1:4:54,3
A really important thing
about this is, when they


1441
1:4:54,3 --> 1:4:56,934
were getting 30 percent
less, they were getting


1442
1:4:56,934 --> 1:5:0,1
paid less than the Taliban
was willing to offer them


1443
1:5:0,1 --> 1:5:2,1
to come to the other side.


1444
1:5:2,1 --> 1:5:5,0
When they got that 30
percent raise, the money


1445
1:5:5,0 --> 1:5:7,266
that they should have had
in the first place, they


1446
1:5:7,266 --> 1:5:9,166
were getting paid more
than the Taliban was


1447
1:5:9,166 --> 1:5:10,767
willing to offer them.


1448
1:5:10,767 --> 1:5:13,6
So if we don't think this
has huge implications not


1449
1:5:13,6 --> 1:5:16,834
just for disaster but for
national security as well


1450
1:5:16,834 --> 1:5:19,767
as Americans to sell
products over seas, the


1451
1:5:19,767 --> 1:5:23,967
effect of this kind of
payments platform, and the


1452
1:5:23,967 --> 1:5:28,0
efficiencies and
opportunities are enormous.


1453
1:5:28,0 --> 1:5:31,166
So moving from cash to
electronic helps us, helps


1454
1:5:31,166 --> 1:5:33,467
our security, it creates
new products, and makes


1455
1:5:33,467 --> 1:5:36,133
the world more safe.


1456
1:5:36,133 --> 1:5:38,834
So we say to ourselves,
well, this is so simple.


1457
1:5:38,834 --> 1:5:39,967
We thought this too.


1458
1:5:39,967 --> 1:5:43,166
We said okay, well, we'll
just -- how many programs


1459
1:5:43,166 --> 1:5:46,533
could we possibly have
doing cash at USAID globally?


1460
1:5:46,533 --> 1:5:48,66
We are in almost a
hundred countries.


1461
1:5:48,66 --> 1:5:52,166
Well, we had a 140
projects that used cash


1462
1:5:52,166 --> 1:5:54,433
because it is hard to
actually transport


1463
1:5:54,433 --> 1:5:56,667
anything else
around the world.


1464
1:5:56,667 --> 1:5:59,633
So we got into this and
we found this is actually


1465
1:5:59,633 --> 1:6:2,66
pretty darn complicated.


1466
1:6:2,66 --> 1:6:6,3
It sort of looks like
navigating this slide.


1467
1:6:6,3 --> 1:6:8,667
It didn't take us long to
realize that there were


1468
1:6:8,667 --> 1:6:11,2
deep challenges to
internal processes,


1469
1:6:11,2 --> 1:6:14,266
contract language, audit
requirements, internal


1470
1:6:14,266 --> 1:6:18,2
champions, and oh, yes, we
wanted to make sure that


1471
1:6:18,2 --> 1:6:20,333
terrorists and money
launderers around the


1472
1:6:20,333 --> 1:6:23,834
world couldn't actually use this new financial structure.


1473
1:6:23,834 --> 1:6:25,7
So we have been working
very closely with our US


1474
1:6:25,7 --> 1:6:27,5
Treasury colleagues.


1475
1:6:27,5 --> 1:6:29,233
And other things I
won't bore you with.


1476
1:6:29,233 --> 1:6:31,2
But it is a challenge that
cuts across the banking


1477
1:6:31,2 --> 1:6:34,66
industry, the payments
industry, technology,


1478
1:6:34,66 --> 1:6:37,4
consumer protection,
and a whole lot of other


1479
1:6:37,4 --> 1:6:39,5
sets of bureaucracies.


1480
1:6:39,5 --> 1:6:43,5
So the White House and us
went on a hunt to find an


1481
1:6:43,5 --> 1:6:46,467
entrepreneur with the
experience and skill to


1482
1:6:46,467 --> 1:6:48,4
join Priya, to join
[inaudible] and others to


1483
1:6:48,4 --> 1:6:51,33
tackle this
multi-faceted challenge.


1484
1:6:51,33 --> 1:6:53,367
So I like to introduce
Karl Mehta, our


1485
1:6:53,367 --> 1:6:55,266
Presidential
innovation fellow.


1486
1:6:55,266 --> 1:7:0,3
[applause]


1487
1:7:0,3 --> 1:7:2,767
We are really
excited to have him.


1488
1:7:2,767 --> 1:7:4,734
Karl is a Silicon Valley
based entrepreneur from


1489
1:7:4,734 --> 1:7:6,367
Fremont, California.


1490
1:7:6,367 --> 1:7:8,66
He is an engineer,inventor.


1491
1:7:8,66 --> 1:7:9,8
He started three
companies.


1492
1:7:9,8 --> 1:7:14,166
His last one, PlaySpan, he
worked -- that he sold to


1493
1:7:14,166 --> 1:7:16,533
Visa, he worked with
companies like Warner


1494
1:7:16,533 --> 1:7:19,667
Brothers, Nickelodeon,
Disney and Facebook.


1495
1:7:19,667 --> 1:7:22,1
So you may have actually
used if you brought,


1496
1:7:22,1 --> 1:7:24,867
bought some virtual goods
on those sites, or you


1497
1:7:24,867 --> 1:7:26,934
bought some real goods you
may have actually used the


1498
1:7:26,934 --> 1:7:28,967
payment platform of Karl.


1499
1:7:28,967 --> 1:7:31,8
So we are so excited
to have you, Karl.


1500
1:7:31,8 --> 1:7:34,1
And we think his expertise
is just going to be


1501
1:7:34,1 --> 1:7:35,9
essential to us
accelerating the


1502
1:7:35,9 --> 1:7:38,7
development of these
platforms world wide and


1503
1:7:38,7 --> 1:7:40,3
the efficiencies that
we can gain in our


1504
1:7:40,3 --> 1:7:42,433
development program.


1505
1:7:42,433 --> 1:7:44,967
So a minute ago I
mentioned that USAID is


1506
1:7:44,967 --> 1:7:46,1
proud of our work.


1507
1:7:46,1 --> 1:7:47,233
We are.


1508
1:7:47,233 --> 1:7:50,433
But actually if we are
going to move from a cash


1509
1:7:50,433 --> 1:7:52,4
based world to
electronic world,


1510
1:7:52,4 --> 1:7:54,166
we have to build a movement.


1511
1:7:54,166 --> 1:7:55,867
We have to build a
movement across the US


1512
1:7:55,867 --> 1:7:58,6
Government hand in hand
with the public sector and


1513
1:7:58,6 --> 1:8:0,767
the private sector
to get out of cash.


1514
1:8:0,767 --> 1:8:3,0
And that is where
you come involved.


1515
1:8:3,0 --> 1:8:5,467
If you work for a company
that does business over


1516
1:8:5,467 --> 1:8:8,4
seas, if you worship at a
place that does charitable


1517
1:8:8,4 --> 1:8:11,4
work over seas, if you
know an NGO that works


1518
1:8:11,4 --> 1:8:14,767
globally, ask them to
start using electronic payments.


1519
1:8:14,767 --> 1:8:15,834
Join us.


1520
1:8:15,834 --> 1:8:18,7
Build this mobile money
and this electronics


1521
1:8:18,7 --> 1:8:23,3
payments platform
and let us realize at


1522
1:8:23,3 --> 1:8:26,834
ProjectTwenty, the kinds
of opportunities that I


1523
1:8:26,834 --> 1:8:28,233
have described today.


1524
1:8:28,233 --> 1:8:31,734
So join me in thanking
Karl and come help us


1525
1:8:31,734 --> 1:8:33,233
revolutionize the world.


1526
1:8:33,233 --> 1:8:39,767
[applause]


1527
1:8:39,767 --> 1:8:41,266
So I would now
like to introduce my good


1528
1:8:41,266 --> 1:8:46,0
friend and most amazing
chief technology officer, for


1529
1:8:46,0 --> 1:8:47,66
the country, Todd Park.


1530
1:8:47,66 --> 1:8:49,3
[applause]


1531
1:8:49,3 --> 1:8:51,967
Todd Park:
Thank you.


1532
1:8:51,967 --> 1:8:57,1
Hello. I just got the news flash that the hash tag innovate.gov


1533
1:8:57,1 --> 1:8:59,367
is trending across the United States of America.


1534
1:8:59,367 --> 1:9:2,6
So join the conversation,
join the fun on Twitter.


1535
1:9:2,6 --> 1:9:4,767
So it is my great pleasure
to talk with you about the


1536
1:9:4,767 --> 1:9:7,533
5th and final Presidential
Innovation Fellows


1537
1:9:7,533 --> 1:9:10,333
Project, the Open Data
Initiatives Program.


1538
1:9:10,333 --> 1:9:12,734
And I would like to start
by talking about the weather.


1539
1:9:12,734 --> 1:9:15,834
Or more specifically
weather data.


1540
1:9:15,834 --> 1:9:17,834
So decades ago, the
government made a key


1541
1:9:17,834 --> 1:9:19,567
decision which was to
actually make all of the


1542
1:9:19,567 --> 1:9:22,1
weather data it was
collecting downloadable


1543
1:9:22,1 --> 1:9:25,233
electronically by
anybody for free.


1544
1:9:25,233 --> 1:9:28,6
What then happened is that
free fuel powered enormous


1545
1:9:28,6 --> 1:9:30,667
rising tide of innovation
in the project.


1546
1:9:30,667 --> 1:9:32,834
Entrepreneurs, who picked
up that data and turned it


1547
1:9:32,834 --> 1:9:35,233
into the Weather Channel,
Weather.Com, iPhone


1548
1:9:35,233 --> 1:9:37,4
weather apps, weather
insurance and much more.


1549
1:9:37,4 --> 1:9:39,9
Growing the economy,
creating jobs, and adding


1550
1:9:39,9 --> 1:9:41,834
a lot of value to
all of our lives.


1551
1:9:41,834 --> 1:9:43,9
Government ran a similar
play in the 80's when


1552
1:9:43,9 --> 1:9:46,266
President Reagan began
the process of liberating


1553
1:9:46,266 --> 1:9:48,367
access, civilly and
commercial access to the


1554
1:9:48,367 --> 1:9:51,2
global positioning system. GPS.


1555
1:9:51,2 --> 1:9:53,233
Which, of course, now
has spun everything from


1556
1:9:53,233 --> 1:9:56,166
navigation systems to
precision crop farming to


1557
1:9:56,166 --> 1:9:58,567
four square on your iPhone
and everything in between.


1558
1:9:58,567 --> 1:10:0,533
In fact, actually last
year alone it is estimated


1559
1:10:0,533 --> 1:10:3,533
that civilian and
commercial access to GPS


1560
1:10:3,533 --> 1:10:7,533
created $90 billion of
value for the American economy.


1561
1:10:7,533 --> 1:10:9,834
Growing jobs, growing the
economy, and improving all


1562
1:10:9,834 --> 1:10:11,467
of our lives in
immeasurable ways.


1563
1:10:11,467 --> 1:10:13,66
And so we love this play.


1564
1:10:13,66 --> 1:10:16,133
We love this play of
basically without


1565
1:10:16,133 --> 1:10:18,66
legislation, without
regulation, without


1566
1:10:18,66 --> 1:10:20,7
actually really spending
a ton of money, right,


1567
1:10:20,7 --> 1:10:22,867
taking data that is
sitting in the vault of


1568
1:10:22,867 --> 1:10:24,6
the government that
taxpayers have already


1569
1:10:24,6 --> 1:10:28,734
paid for, and Jiu Jitsuing
it into the public domain


1570
1:10:28,734 --> 1:10:30,867
as machine readable
fuel so the American


1571
1:10:30,867 --> 1:10:33,967
entrepreneur can take
and turn into magic.


1572
1:10:33,967 --> 1:10:36,633
Turn into all kinds of new
products, services that


1573
1:10:36,633 --> 1:10:38,8
help improve American
lives, create jobs, and


1574
1:10:38,8 --> 1:10:40,367
grow the economy.


1575
1:10:40,367 --> 1:10:42,3
So that is what the Open
Data Initiatives Program


1576
1:10:42,3 --> 1:10:43,166
is all about.


1577
1:10:43,166 --> 1:10:45,834
It is expanding and
accelerating the work to


1578
1:10:45,834 --> 1:10:48,967
liberate data as fuel for
American entrepreneurship


1579
1:10:48,967 --> 1:10:49,767
and innovation.


1580
1:10:49,767 --> 1:10:52,333
We are focused on
these seven sectors.


1581
1:10:52,333 --> 1:10:54,567
Health is actually an area
where through the Health


1582
1:10:54,567 --> 1:10:56,433
Data Initiative we have
been liberating health


1583
1:10:56,433 --> 1:10:59,166
related data, information
resources for a few years


1584
1:10:59,166 --> 1:11:1,5
now with hundreds of
companies, large and


1585
1:11:1,5 --> 1:11:3,2
small, taking that data
and turning it into all


1586
1:11:3,2 --> 1:11:4,0
kinds of products.


1587
1:11:4,0 --> 1:11:5,934
It will help you pick the
right hospital or doctor


1588
1:11:5,934 --> 1:11:6,7
for your family.


1589
1:11:6,7 --> 1:11:8,633
Connect to a clinical
trial that can save your life.


1590
1:11:8,633 --> 1:11:10,1
Help doctors deliver
better care.


1591
1:11:10,1 --> 1:11:12,333
Help you manage your
asthma, using the latest


1592
1:11:12,333 --> 1:11:13,633
medical knowledge
and much more.


1593
1:11:13,633 --> 1:11:16,567
We just kicked off in May,
a Safety Date Initiative.


1594
1:11:16,567 --> 1:11:18,266
We kicked off actually
a couple of months ago


1595
1:11:18,266 --> 1:11:19,533
Energy Data Initiative.


1596
1:11:19,533 --> 1:11:21,66
An Education
Data Initiative.


1597
1:11:21,66 --> 1:11:23,0
I see folks on that team
here in the room for the


1598
1:11:23,0 --> 1:11:24,66
Department of Education.


1599
1:11:24,66 --> 1:11:25,734
We will shortly be
launching an Impact Data


1600
1:11:25,734 --> 1:11:28,433
Initiative focused on non
profit sector related data.


1601
1:11:28,433 --> 1:11:30,9
Global Development Data
Initiative focused on food


1602
1:11:30,9 --> 1:11:32,734
security and
other key topics.


1603
1:11:32,734 --> 1:11:34,9
And a Finance Data
Initiative as well.


1604
1:11:34,9 --> 1:11:39,1
And the whole idea is not
just to liberate data. Okay.


1605
1:11:39,1 --> 1:11:40,967
Because data by
itself is useless. Right.


1606
1:11:40,967 --> 1:11:43,367
I can't feed
my babies data.


1607
1:11:43,367 --> 1:11:45,433
I can't pour data on a
wound and heal it, right?


1608
1:11:45,433 --> 1:11:48,66
I can't actually pour data
on a road and fix it.


1609
1:11:48,66 --> 1:11:50,834
Data is only useful
if it is applied.


1610
1:11:50,834 --> 1:11:53,3
So you do actually have to
make new data available,


1611
1:11:53,3 --> 1:11:54,7
that is actually
very helpful.


1612
1:11:54,7 --> 1:11:57,6
You also need to take
existing public data, that


1613
1:11:57,6 --> 1:12:0,3
may be available, but
in books, PDF's, static


1614
1:12:0,3 --> 1:12:3,133
websites that are useless
to a developer, and


1615
1:12:3,133 --> 1:12:5,467
actually make it available
in forms that are useful


1616
1:12:5,467 --> 1:12:6,9
to a developer. Right?


1617
1:12:6,9 --> 1:12:9,2
Bulk down loadable files,
you know, liquid machine,


1618
1:12:9,2 --> 1:12:11,1
readable data, accessible
through API's, basically


1619
1:12:11,1 --> 1:12:12,9
forms that are
usable by developers.


1620
1:12:12,9 --> 1:12:13,834
You do that too.


1621
1:12:13,834 --> 1:12:16,367
But if you just do that,
you have accomplished


1622
1:12:16,367 --> 1:12:18,333
actually some of what
you need, but not all.


1623
1:12:18,333 --> 1:12:19,834
And the last thing you
need to do is you need to


1624
1:12:19,834 --> 1:12:22,734
actually engage the people
that you hope will use the


1625
1:12:22,734 --> 1:12:26,367
data, will apply the data
to create tangible benefit


1626
1:12:26,367 --> 1:12:27,3
for the American people.


1627
1:12:27,3 --> 1:12:29,533
Engage with the
entrepreneurs, innovators,


1628
1:12:29,533 --> 1:12:31,6
spread the word about the
data that is available.


1629
1:12:31,6 --> 1:12:33,734
Get their feedback on what
can be improved about,


1630
1:12:33,734 --> 1:12:36,867
what feedback actually
would be useful to make a


1631
1:12:36,867 --> 1:12:39,567
new data resources
available so on and so forth.


1632
1:12:39,567 --> 1:12:41,4
Celebrate what they are
doing, spread the word


1633
1:12:41,4 --> 1:12:43,1
about what they are doing,
and catalyze a chain


1634
1:12:43,1 --> 1:12:46,7
reaction of innovation
that continually expands


1635
1:12:46,7 --> 1:12:48,533
the array of services,
products, features


1636
1:12:48,533 --> 1:12:50,9
benefits, produced for the
American people, produced


1637
1:12:50,9 --> 1:12:53,0
by entrepreneurs using
our data, in a way that


1638
1:12:53,0 --> 1:12:56,567
actually improves lives
and creates jobs.


1639
1:12:56,567 --> 1:12:58,5
And so what does success
actually look like at the


1640
1:12:58,5 --> 1:12:59,533
end of the day?


1641
1:12:59,533 --> 1:13:3,5
Success looks like Dr.
Pete Hudson, emergency


1642
1:13:3,5 --> 1:13:5,567
room doc and entrepreneur.


1643
1:13:5,567 --> 1:13:7,934
And Pete Hudson, in fact,
happens to be here.


1644
1:13:7,934 --> 1:13:9,66
What do you know?


1645
1:13:9,66 --> 1:13:10,734
He is on the stage,
Dr. Pete Hudson.


1646
1:13:10,734 --> 1:13:16,7
[applause]


1647
1:13:16,7 --> 1:13:17,7
Dr. Pete Hudson:
Well, thank you,


1648
1:13:17,7 --> 1:13:20,633
Todd, and thank you very
much for having me here at


1649
1:13:20,633 --> 1:13:22,333
this very exciting
event here today.


1650
1:13:22,333 --> 1:13:25,133
Lots of energy
in this room.


1651
1:13:25,133 --> 1:13:28,333
And Todd asked me to come
here to talk to you about


1652
1:13:28,333 --> 1:13:30,8
the perspective as an
entrepreneur from the


1653
1:13:30,8 --> 1:13:33,734
private sector who has
worked with open data from


1654
1:13:33,734 --> 1:13:35,133
the government before.


1655
1:13:35,133 --> 1:13:36,633
And it has been a really
important part of our


1656
1:13:36,633 --> 1:13:39,633
company and so I want to
tell you our creation story.


1657
1:13:39,633 --> 1:13:44,533
So iTriage was created in
2009 by two crusty old ER


1658
1:13:44,533 --> 1:13:47,133
docs who are unlikely
entrepreneurs.


1659
1:13:47,133 --> 1:13:49,367
The good looking one up
here is Wayne Guerra on


1660
1:13:49,367 --> 1:13:51,266
the left and the other guy
has a little bit more


1661
1:13:51,266 --> 1:13:53,6
gray hair now.


1662
1:13:53,6 --> 1:13:57,767
And we started the company
after practicing emergency


1663
1:13:57,767 --> 1:14:0,433
medicine for about 20
years and taking care of


1664
1:14:0,433 --> 1:14:2,633
about 50,000 patients.


1665
1:14:2,633 --> 1:14:4,734
What we noticed during
that period of time was


1666
1:14:4,734 --> 1:14:8,467
that people struggled
with the core information


1667
1:14:8,467 --> 1:14:10,166
surrounding their
health care.


1668
1:14:10,166 --> 1:14:12,133
That they didn't have the
right information at the


1669
1:14:12,133 --> 1:14:15,266
right time to make the
right decision and an


1670
1:14:15,266 --> 1:14:16,7
informed decision about
what to do about


1671
1:14:16,7 --> 1:14:17,533
their health care.


1672
1:14:17,533 --> 1:14:19,66
And that led to
huge problems.


1673
1:14:19,66 --> 1:14:24,333
Increased costs, bad
outcomes, and huge


1674
1:14:24,333 --> 1:14:26,3
inefficiencies
in the system.


1675
1:14:26,3 --> 1:14:28,9
And one day we just
decided we had had enough,


1676
1:14:28,9 --> 1:14:30,767
we had to do
something about it.


1677
1:14:30,767 --> 1:14:35,7
But we weren't really
sure how to do it.


1678
1:14:35,7 --> 1:14:39,567
Enter the Smart Phone.


1679
1:14:39,567 --> 1:14:43,533
Todd Park:
Should be.


1680
1:14:43,533 --> 1:14:45,4
Dr. Pete Hudson:
So enter the Smart Phone a


1681
1:14:45,4 --> 1:14:48,3
device that you can take with you anywhere you need to be.


1682
1:14:48,3 --> 1:14:50,567
It can access
data remotely.


1683
1:14:50,567 --> 1:14:51,834
It has a beautiful
interface.


1684
1:14:51,834 --> 1:14:53,867
It is easy for people to
use and you can distribute


1685
1:14:53,867 --> 1:14:56,0
technology wirelessly.


1686
1:14:56,0 --> 1:14:57,867
We called it our iTriage,
because we wanted people


1687
1:14:57,867 --> 1:14:59,934
to be able to make
decisions based on


1688
1:14:59,934 --> 1:15:2,967
information and based on
the taxonomy of health care.


1689
1:15:2,967 --> 1:15:6,3
So we started to assemble
data and we put together


1690
1:15:6,3 --> 1:15:8,867
clinical information, we
connected that to provider


1691
1:15:8,867 --> 1:15:12,934
directories, and built a
technology that allowed


1692
1:15:12,934 --> 1:15:18,5
people to start to work
through the pathways of,


1693
1:15:18,5 --> 1:15:20,467
of clinical information
starting with the symptom,


1694
1:15:20,467 --> 1:15:23,533
going to conditions, then
all of the way to the


1695
1:15:23,533 --> 1:15:24,667
right providers, and then
connecting directly


1696
1:15:24,667 --> 1:15:26,533
with that provider.


1697
1:15:26,533 --> 1:15:29,633
It was a very fun exercise
in building a product and


1698
1:15:29,633 --> 1:15:32,1
so we launched it
in the marketplace.


1699
1:15:32,1 --> 1:15:34,467
We didn't know
what would happen.


1700
1:15:34,467 --> 1:15:37,166
And you know, one of the
reasons I am here today is


1701
1:15:37,166 --> 1:15:39,133
because I think it became
wildly successful.


1702
1:15:39,133 --> 1:15:41,567
Millions of people
have downloaded it.


1703
1:15:41,567 --> 1:15:45,166
In fact, we are up to 7
million people right now.


1704
1:15:45,166 --> 1:15:49,867
Every month about it is
used about 3 million times


1705
1:15:49,867 --> 1:15:51,867
to make health care
decisions and to get the


1706
1:15:51,867 --> 1:15:55,7
information to make
informed, take informed action.


1707
1:15:55,7 --> 1:15:58,5
It has been adopted by
close to 20 percent of the


1708
1:15:58,5 --> 1:16:1,433
acute hospital
marketplace, and we have


1709
1:16:1,433 --> 1:16:3,967
added on functionality to
like appointment setting


1710
1:16:3,967 --> 1:16:6,734
and ER check in, urgent
care check in, and things


1711
1:16:6,734 --> 1:16:8,767
like that to connect
directly into the HIT


1712
1:16:8,767 --> 1:16:11,1
systems in the hospitals
and provide that data


1713
1:16:11,1 --> 1:16:14,4
right back to
the consumer.


1714
1:16:14,4 --> 1:16:17,367
It is -- it has been well
reviewed by people all


1715
1:16:17,367 --> 1:16:18,2
around the country.


1716
1:16:18,2 --> 1:16:20,667
In fact, we have had
60,000 people write in


1717
1:16:20,667 --> 1:16:22,867
reviews and it is a four
and a half out of five


1718
1:16:22,867 --> 1:16:25,867
stars on both markets.


1719
1:16:25,867 --> 1:16:28,2
We were so passionate
about this and drove this,


1720
1:16:28,2 --> 1:16:32,166
this technology as
quickly as we could.


1721
1:16:32,166 --> 1:16:36,6
In fact, from start up to
the first significant


1722
1:16:36,6 --> 1:16:40,1
M Health Acquisition in the
marketplace by Aetna, it


1723
1:16:40,1 --> 1:16:41,333
was about two
and a half years.


1724
1:16:41,333 --> 1:16:42,667
And now we are part of
this amazing group at


1725
1:16:42,667 --> 1:16:46,133
Aetna that is looking
at post reform business


1726
1:16:46,133 --> 1:16:48,33
models for health care.


1727
1:16:48,33 --> 1:16:49,333
And how we fit into that.


1728
1:16:49,333 --> 1:16:50,367
So let's go back to the
creation story and


1729
1:16:50,367 --> 1:16:52,767
back to 2010.


1730
1:16:52,767 --> 1:16:55,734
One of our employees
Jonathan White, who is


1731
1:16:55,734 --> 1:16:57,467
starting to work with
different sectors of


1732
1:16:57,467 --> 1:16:59,834
government came into me
and said, have you heard


1733
1:16:59,834 --> 1:17:2,834
about this Open Data
Initiative thing?


1734
1:17:2,834 --> 1:17:4,166
I said, no, I haven't
heard about it.


1735
1:17:4,166 --> 1:17:5,367
But it sounds interesting.


1736
1:17:5,367 --> 1:17:9,433
So we got connected with
Todd and others here in


1737
1:17:9,433 --> 1:17:11,967
the government, and we, we
found out that there was


1738
1:17:11,967 --> 1:17:14,834
great data, provider
data that we needed.


1739
1:17:14,834 --> 1:17:18,533
Federally qualified health
centers provider, Medicare


1740
1:17:18,533 --> 1:17:21,266
provider data sets, mental
health and substance abuse


1741
1:17:21,266 --> 1:17:23,9
data sets and they were
actually put together and


1742
1:17:23,9 --> 1:17:26,133
opened up by great people
in the government.


1743
1:17:26,133 --> 1:17:29,7
And made available to us.


1744
1:17:29,7 --> 1:17:32,767
We participated in two
different events and presented.


1745
1:17:32,767 --> 1:17:36,2
And I am happy to announce
that there has been


1746
1:17:36,2 --> 1:17:38,4
125,000 people that have
found federally qualified


1747
1:17:38,4 --> 1:17:41,66
health centers since
we started that.


1748
1:17:41,66 --> 1:17:44,467
About 25,000 people have
found mental health and


1749
1:17:44,467 --> 1:17:46,433
substance abuse centers
through our technology


1750
1:17:46,433 --> 1:17:47,9
with this data.


1751
1:17:47,9 --> 1:17:50,4
So we are actually really
connecting people.


1752
1:17:50,4 --> 1:17:52,6
But I think the two things
that I am proudest about


1753
1:17:52,6 --> 1:17:55,1
with this company are,
one, that we went from two


1754
1:17:55,1 --> 1:17:59,3
employees who were unpaid,
and I can vouch for that


1755
1:17:59,3 --> 1:18:1,233
because I was one of them.


1756
1:18:1,233 --> 1:18:4,1
To now 80 employees.


1757
1:18:4,1 --> 1:18:5,6
15 contractors.


1758
1:18:5,6 --> 1:18:7,333
30 open requisitions.


1759
1:18:7,333 --> 1:18:10,834
So for those of you who
are motivated, like to


1760
1:18:10,834 --> 1:18:13,533
build stuff, and are
really talented come join


1761
1:18:13,533 --> 1:18:17,2
the most amazing group of
employees at our offices.


1762
1:18:17,2 --> 1:18:18,467
I know they are watching
right now and they


1763
1:18:18,467 --> 1:18:21,967
are absolutely fantastic.


1764
1:18:21,967 --> 1:18:24,367
So that is one of the
things that I am proudest of.


1765
1:18:24,367 --> 1:18:26,9
The second thing that I am
proudest of is the number


1766
1:18:26,9 --> 1:18:29,5
of stories we have gotten
of people who have been


1767
1:18:29,5 --> 1:18:31,533
empowered by this
technology and made better


1768
1:18:31,533 --> 1:18:36,367
decisions from a man who
had jaw pain, didn't know


1769
1:18:36,367 --> 1:18:38,533
what it could be, used our
technology and connected


1770
1:18:38,533 --> 1:18:40,4
to, oh, it could
be a heart attack.


1771
1:18:40,4 --> 1:18:41,9
I am going to call 911.


1772
1:18:41,9 --> 1:18:43,767
It saved his life.


1773
1:18:43,767 --> 1:18:46,934
To a story I just got the
other day, a visually


1774
1:18:46,934 --> 1:18:49,6
impaired woman with
cerebral palsy, who has


1775
1:18:49,6 --> 1:18:52,433
multiple medical problems,
and is bed bound, who uses


1776
1:18:52,433 --> 1:18:54,633
our technology to become
more informed about her


1777
1:18:54,633 --> 1:18:56,834
health conditions
and medications.


1778
1:18:56,834 --> 1:18:58,7
And now can actually have
communication with her


1779
1:18:58,7 --> 1:19:2,0
doctor about the
different issues.


1780
1:19:2,0 --> 1:19:3,3
Those are the
things that matter.


1781
1:19:3,3 --> 1:19:4,934
So that is our story.


1782
1:19:4,934 --> 1:19:7,6
It is a story of American
innovation that is trying


1783
1:19:7,6 --> 1:19:9,734
to tackle a really
big problem.


1784
1:19:9,734 --> 1:19:12,7
So download iTriage.


1785
1:19:12,7 --> 1:19:14,7
And it took us 20 years
to take care of 50,000


1786
1:19:14,7 --> 1:19:17,7
patients and three to
take care of 7 million.


1787
1:19:17,7 --> 1:19:20,266
That is how technology
should scale and


1788
1:19:20,266 --> 1:19:21,133
make things better.


1789
1:19:21,133 --> 1:19:22,533
So thank you very much.


1790
1:19:22,533 --> 1:19:24,66
Todd Park:
Thank you so much, Pete.


1791
1:19:24,66 --> 1:19:24,5
[applause]


1792
1:19:24,5 --> 1:19:28,33
Rock on.


1793
1:19:28,33 --> 1:19:30,0
And so what is the play?


1794
1:19:30,0 --> 1:19:30,8
What is the Open Data
Initiatives Play exactly?


1795
1:19:30,8 --> 1:19:35,633
It is clone Pete Hudson.


1796
1:19:35,633 --> 1:19:36,834
That is the play.


1797
1:19:36,834 --> 1:19:38,767
Clone the story.


1798
1:19:38,767 --> 1:19:42,266
And very specifically
clone the actual use


1799
1:19:42,266 --> 1:19:43,433
of the data.


1800
1:19:43,433 --> 1:19:46,233
The application of data by
American entrepreneurship


1801
1:19:46,233 --> 1:19:49,867
innovators to create real
benefit in people's lives.


1802
1:19:49,867 --> 1:19:50,5
Right.


1803
1:19:50,5 --> 1:19:52,433
Help people find the right
doctor that could


1804
1:19:52,433 --> 1:19:53,333
save their life.


1805
1:19:53,333 --> 1:19:55,333
Help your daughter find
the college that will


1806
1:19:55,333 --> 1:19:57,734
provide the best
value for her.


1807
1:19:57,734 --> 1:20:1,7
Help a new father or
mother know what products


1808
1:20:1,7 --> 1:20:4,1
have been recalled, what
cribs have been recalled


1809
1:20:4,1 --> 1:20:6,834
so that you can actually
keep your baby safe.


1810
1:20:6,834 --> 1:20:8,8
Get transparency on the
non profit marketplace so


1811
1:20:8,8 --> 1:20:10,7
you actually put your
charitable contributions,


1812
1:20:10,7 --> 1:20:13,266
your hard earned dollars
into the non profits that


1813
1:20:13,266 --> 1:20:18,133
will produce the best
value socially for your money.


1814
1:20:18,133 --> 1:20:20,633
Real tools, real services,
built by American


1815
1:20:20,633 --> 1:20:23,367
entrepreneurs using free
government data that can


1816
1:20:23,367 --> 1:20:27,533
help make American lives
easier, make them better,


1817
1:20:27,533 --> 1:20:29,8
and create jobs and grow
the economy all at


1818
1:20:29,8 --> 1:20:31,33
the same time.


1819
1:20:31,33 --> 1:20:34,5
And we are so incredibly
excited by the fellows


1820
1:20:34,5 --> 1:20:37,967
that have come to town to
help our amazing team do that.


1821
1:20:37,967 --> 1:20:39,333
And so I would like to
introduce them starting


1822
1:20:39,333 --> 1:20:45,867
with Ian Kalin from San
Francisco, California.


1823
1:20:45,867 --> 1:20:49,367
Ian has a story out
of a Hollywood movie.


1824
1:20:49,367 --> 1:20:51,133
He started his
professional career as a


1825
1:20:51,133 --> 1:20:53,266

1:20:53,266 --> 1:20:55,266
Navy, post 911.

1829
1:21:0,133 --> 1:21:2,33

After leaving the navy,
he joined, a fast growing


1831
1:21:3,9 --> 1:21:4,7
energy start up.


1832
1:21:4,7 --> 1:21:6,66
Had a brilliant
career there.


1833
1:21:6,66 --> 1:21:7,834
That delivered market
intelligence solutions to


1834
1:21:7,834 --> 1:21:10,4
the electricity
and gas sectors.


1835
1:21:10,4 --> 1:21:12,667
He is incredibly
passionate about energy


1836
1:21:12,667 --> 1:21:14,467
and empowering
people through data.


1837
1:21:14,467 --> 1:21:17,33
And he has chosen to give
up a full ride to Harvard


1838
1:21:17,33 --> 1:21:18,867
University's Kennedy
School to serve his


1839
1:21:18,867 --> 1:21:21,767

She actually did the first
start up weekend focused on gov.


1854
1:21:58,367 --> 1:21:59,7
In her spare time, I don't
know how she finds the


1855
1:21:59,7 --> 1:22:3,6
time, she works with medically fragile foster children.


1856
1:22:3,6 --> 1:22:4,967
And she will be a critical
force propelling our

It is a solemn oath and it

swear or to affirm.


2038
1:29:16,467 --> 1:29:19,567

2039
1:29:19,567 --> 1:29:22,133
