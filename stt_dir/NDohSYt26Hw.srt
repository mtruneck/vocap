CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to CNN STUDENT
NEWS. Products being pulled off shelves. Authorities


2
0:0:17,25 --> 0:0:23,169
running investigations, some shoppers protesting.
All of it has to do with meat. Some packages


3
0:0:23,169 --> 0:0:28,79
that were labeled as 100 percent beef were
discovered to contain horse meat. Ireland,


4
0:0:28,79 --> 0:0:33,829
the U.K, France, Germany, Sweden Switzerland,
Romania. This scandal is affecting more than


5
0:0:33,829 --> 0:0:39,57
a dozen European countries. The latest news
is that Nestle, a mega food company, is pulling


6
0:0:39,57 --> 0:0:44,629
some of its products in Italy, Spain and France.
It`s also stopping deliveries of some products


7
0:0:44,629 --> 0:0:50,239
from a German supplier, because traces of
horse DNA were found in the meat. But let`s


8
0:0:50,239 --> 0:0:54,899
get the big question out of the way: will
eating horse meat make you sick? British health


9
0:0:54,899 --> 0:1:1,28
officials say, no. The meat itself not a risk,
but one concern is about a drug called "bute".


10
0:1:1,28 --> 0:1:6,409
It`s used on horses and it can cause some
rare, but serious health problems for humans.


11
0:1:6,409 --> 0:1:11,39
There is also a religious issue here. Some
religions have dietary laws that restrict


12
0:1:11,39 --> 0:1:15,869
eating horse meat. Since these packages were
labeled incorrectly, people might have eaten


13
0:1:15,869 --> 0:1:20,54
eat without knowing. In some countries like
France, China and Russia eating horse meat


14
0:1:20,54 --> 0:1:25,92
is common. In others, like the United Kingdom,
the idea is unthinkable. Would this kind of


15
0:1:25,92 --> 0:1:31,11
thing change your eating habits? On Twitter,
Chris told me: "Yes, there are not good circumstances


16
0:1:31,11 --> 0:1:36,19
I can think of where I`d willingly eat horse."
Matt disagreed: "Honestly, I wouldn`t change


17
0:1:36,19 --> 0:1:40,3
my eating habits just for one small chance
that I`ll eat horse meat."


18
0:1:40,3 --> 0:1:41,37
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


19
0:1:41,37 --> 0:1:48,87
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me.
I`m a U.S. state that borders Canada. I have


20
0:1:48,87 --> 0:1:54,81
one of America`s smallest populations. My
southern neighbor shares part of my name.


21
0:1:54,81 --> 0:2:4,29
And my capital city is Bismarck. I`m North
Dakota. And my name comes from a Native American


22
0:2:4,29 --> 0:2:6,15
world for "friend."


23
0:2:6,15 --> 0:2:9,3
(END VIDEO CLIP)


24
0:2:9,3 --> 0:2:14,5
AZUZ: You might expect North Dakota to get
hammered with snow all winter, but on average,


25
0:2:14,5 --> 0:2:19,81
the state gets less snow than the states to
the east or west of it. Then, there is this:


26
0:2:19,81 --> 0:2:25,43
a winter storm slammed part of the state last
weekend. The I-reporter who sent this video


27
0:2:25,43 --> 0:2:30,469
in, said there were four to eight inches of
snow and winds blowing through it around 50


28
0:2:30,469 --> 0:2:35,99
miles per hour. The snow and fog made it hard
for driver to see, so officials put out a


29
0:2:35,99 --> 0:2:40,739
travel alert. They also warned drivers to
watch out for snow plows that were working


30
0:2:40,739 --> 0:2:42,49
to clear the roads.


31
0:2:42,49 --> 0:2:47,719
Weather is flying, and flying is weather.
A pilot named Bob Buck (ph) wrote that, showing


32
0:2:47,719 --> 0:2:51,779
that the two thing are always linked. That`s
why storms like the North Dakota blizzard


33
0:2:51,779 --> 0:2:56,45
or the recent nor`easter on the East coast
always affect air travel. Flying may still


34
0:2:56,45 --> 0:3:1,379
be the safest way to travel, but there is
a lot that goes into making it that way. Ayesha


35
0:3:1,379 --> 0:3:3,26
Durgahee shows us what.


36
0:3:3,26 --> 0:3:5,969
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


37
0:3:5,969 --> 0:3:12,189
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, (inaudible)
from the Atlantic. This is your captain.


38
0:3:12,189 --> 0:3:16,489
AYESHA DURGAHEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And in-flight
forecast from the front of the plane.


39
0:3:16,489 --> 0:3:19,939
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (inaudible).


40
0:3:19,939 --> 0:3:25,239
DURGAHEE: Once the seat belt sign is on, we
can get back to enjoying a meal or a movie,


41
0:3:25,239 --> 0:3:29,499
because the planes we fly in are designed
to battle the elements that can suddenly cross


42
0:3:29,499 --> 0:3:30,279
their paths.


43
0:3:30,279 --> 0:3:33,31
PROFESSOR MANU HADDAD, LIGHTNING LAB, CARDIFF
UNIVERSITY: There is one lightning strike


44
0:3:33,31 --> 0:3:39,529
every second around the world. Every single
aircraft is hit by lightning once a year.


45
0:3:39,529 --> 0:3:45,439
DURGAHEE: Here, at Cardiff University in Wales,
lightning strikes every day, where capacities


46
0:3:45,439 --> 0:3:53,4
discharge a current of 100,000 amps in a microsecond
recreating the power of a lightning bolt at


47
0:3:53,4 --> 0:3:58,209
altitude. The aluminum body of an aircraft
is highly conductive, and acts as a Faraday


48
0:3:58,209 --> 0:4:4,419
cage. A metallic shield that directs the electric
charge outside towards the back of the plane.


49
0:4:4,419 --> 0:4:8,209
And the passengers on board won`t feel a thing.


50
0:4:8,209 --> 0:4:13,559
This $2 million lightning lab in partnership
with EADS and the Welsh government, tests


51
0:4:13,559 --> 0:4:18,1
different conductor strips on the nose of
a plane and new composite materials found


52
0:4:18,1 --> 0:4:22,29
on modern aircraft.


53
0:4:22,29 --> 0:4:26,62
Another built-in defense mechanism is using
the heat from the engines to melt ice around


54
0:4:26,62 --> 0:4:28,68
them and along the edge of the wings.


55
0:4:28,68 --> 0:4:37,3
And here at Cranfield University, they have
an ice tunnel. Minus ten degrees Celsius with


56
0:4:37,3 --> 0:4:43,58
a wind speed of 100 miles per hour. They can
see how ice builds up and understand its aerodynamic


57
0:4:43,58 --> 0:4:43,7
qualities.


58
0:4:43,7 --> 0:4:47,42
DR. DAVID HAMMOND, CRANFIELD UNIVERSITY: What
we`d find is that generally the ice that forms


59
0:4:47,42 --> 0:4:52,14
in this area here, it can be quite thin, but
the ice, which forms a little bit further


60
0:4:52,14 --> 0:4:54,37
back can be a lot thicker, which actually
reverses the curvature of the leading edge.


61
0:4:54,37 --> 0:4:57,9
DURGAHEE (on camera): It changes the shape
of the wing, essentially.


62
0:4:57,9 --> 0:5:2,29
HAMMOND: Quite dramatically, in some cases,
yes. Unless you do something to prevent it.


63
0:5:2,29 --> 0:5:7,8
So, in an aircraft, typically we`ll work out
which parts of the aircraft are most critical


64
0:5:7,8 --> 0:5:9,32
aerodynamically, and then make sure that they
are protected.


65
0:5:9,32 --> 0:5:13,41
DURGAHEE (voice over): When it comes to aircraft
design and weather, at research level, there


66
0:5:13,41 --> 0:5:18,85
are men and women dedicating their lives to
specific weather conditions, to ensure planes


67
0:5:18,85 --> 0:5:25,22
are built to buffer and bear the harshest
of conditions. And then it`s up to the pilots


68
0:5:25,22 --> 0:5:26,3
to do the rest.


69
0:5:26,3 --> 0:5:26,96

70
0:5:26,96 --> 0:5:27,95
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


71
0:5:27,95 --> 0:5:33,84
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s time for "The Shoutout."
Polyethylene is used to make some plastics,


72
0:5:33,84 --> 0:5:39,78
but what chemical elements make up polyethylene?
If you think you know it, then shout it out!


73
0:5:39,78 --> 0:5:47,1
Is it hydrogen and silicon, carbon and hydrogen,
nitrogen and carbon or lithium and aluminum?


74
0:5:47,1 --> 0:5:55,8
You`ve got three seconds, go!


75
0:5:55,8 --> 0:6:1,21
Polyethylene is a chain of carbon and hydrogen
atoms that can take a long time to break down.


76
0:6:1,21 --> 0:6:4,33
That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."


77
0:6:4,33 --> 0:6:6,27
(END VIDEO CLIP)


78
0:6:6,27 --> 0:6:11,34
AZUZ: How long are we talking about? The honest
answer is "we don`t know for sure." Plastics


79
0:6:11,34 --> 0:6:15,9
just haven`t been around long enough. But
scientists estimate it could take anywhere


80
0:6:15,9 --> 0:6:20,42
from 500 to a 1000 years for some of these
things to break down. That`s part of the reason


81
0:6:20,42 --> 0:6:26,67
why Sacramento, California`s capital is thinking
about banning plastic bags. The city council


82
0:6:26,67 --> 0:6:31,56
says they pile up in landfills or show up
as litter on roads and in trees or rivers.


83
0:6:31,56 --> 0:6:36,15
The ban would be on plastic bags in large
grocery and retail stores. Instead, people


84
0:6:36,15 --> 0:6:41,75
could bring their own bags or pay around ten
cents for a paper bag from the store. Some


85
0:6:41,75 --> 0:6:45,68
of the stores were on board with the idea,
but at least one shopper said he doesn`t want


86
0:6:45,68 --> 0:6:50,65
the plastic bags to disappear since he reuses
them for other things.


87
0:6:50,65 --> 0:6:54,58
When the stock market closed yesterday, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average was higher than


88
0:6:54,58 --> 0:6:58,68
it`s been in five years. You might know that
the Dow is one way to measure how the whole


89
0:6:58,68 --> 0:7:4,14
economy is doing, but do you know how the
Dow Jones Average works? What about calculating


90
0:7:4,14 --> 0:7:8,13
the interest rate on the student loan for
college? When I was back in school, I didn`t


91
0:7:8,13 --> 0:7:12,54
know. There`s a program, though, that tries
to teach students that kind of financial literacy


92
0:7:12,54 --> 0:7:15,28
to help the students future and possibly the
country`s.


93
0:7:15,28 --> 0:7:16,15
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


94
0:7:16,15 --> 0:7:22,3
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Another key thing about
investment is there`s going to be risk -- some


95
0:7:22,3 --> 0:7:22,89
amount of risk involved.


96
0:7:22,89 --> 0:7:25,77
SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Auston
Kennedy is a high school senior, and although


97
0:7:25,77 --> 0:7:30,45
he can`t buy a house or a car just yet, he
wants to be financially responsible at an


98
0:7:30,45 --> 0:7:30,81
early age.


99
0:7:30,81 --> 0:7:33,11
AUSTON KENNEDY, SENIOR, WEST LAKE HIGH SCHOOL:
It`s important for teenagers to learn to be


100
0:7:33,11 --> 0:7:37,73
financially literate so that before they are
in a position to manage their own finance,


101
0:7:37,73 --> 0:7:41,99
to make their decisions, they already have
a good base as far as what`s appropriate,


102
0:7:41,99 --> 0:7:43,76
what`s the best way to manage their funds.


103
0:7:43,76 --> 0:7:48,17
MALVEAUX: Kennedy got his advice from a program
that brings real life banking practices into


104
0:7:48,17 --> 0:7:53,9
the classroom. John Bryant heads up Banking
on Our Future, also called BOOF.


105
0:7:53,9 --> 0:7:55,81
JOHN HOPE BRYANT, CEO AND FOUNDER, OPERATION
HOPE: You`re going to grow up and do well,


106
0:7:55,81 --> 0:7:59,639
and do good. You don`t want to just do well
for yourself, you want to do well, and then


107
0:7:59,639 --> 0:8:1,42
get back to your community as well.


108
0:8:1,42 --> 0:8:5,8
MALVEAUX: Bryant`s non-profit has been around
for 20 years. He says his mission is to empower


109
0:8:5,8 --> 0:8:10,38
communities to reach people at a young age
so they could control their own financial


110
0:8:10,38 --> 0:8:11,1
destiny.


111
0:8:11,1 --> 0:8:14,49
BRYANT: Connect education with aspiration,
these kids are dropping out of high school,


112
0:8:14,49 --> 0:8:18,6
because they don`t think education is relevant
to their future. It`s real simple. Give them


113
0:8:18,6 --> 0:8:22,5
something to believe in. There`s nothing more
valuable than investing in their education,


114
0:8:22,5 --> 0:8:25,389
investing in their self-esteem, especially
investing in their spiritual growth and then


115
0:8:25,389 --> 0:8:26,42
investing in their dream.


116
0:8:26,42 --> 0:8:30,8
MALVEAUX: Hip hop mogul and entrepreneur Russell
Simmons is a big supporter of the program.


117
0:8:30,8 --> 0:8:33,709
RUSSELL SIMMONS, CHAIRMAN AND CEO RUSH COMMUNICATIONS:
People need to be educated, compete in any


118
0:8:33,709 --> 0:8:39,719
sector of the society. We spend so much money
on a war machine, and so little money on our


119
0:8:39,719 --> 0:8:43,269
children`s education. And our kids -- they
don`t have lobbyists, so, you know, we have


120
0:8:43,269 --> 0:8:44,459
to lobby for them.


121
0:8:44,459 --> 0:8:48,92
MALVEAUX: As Auston prepares for college,
Bryant sees his investment paying off.


122
0:8:48,92 --> 0:8:53,64
KENNEDY: I`ve been asking a lot more of the
financial aid representatives about the best


123
0:8:53,64 --> 0:8:59,5
ways to manage funds in college. I probably
wouldn`t have had inclination to ask those


124
0:8:59,5 --> 0:9:2,3
questions, had I not been involved with the
Banking on Our Future program.


125
0:9:2,3 --> 0:9:4,34
MALVEAUX: Suzanne Malveaux, CNN, Atlanta.

AZUZ: So, how good are you at managing your
money? I mean whether or not you`re considering


128
0:9:8,87 --> 0:9:13,44
yourself financially literate, do you tend
to save more or spend more? Our blog is open

In this Youtube video, those numbers are flipped.

134
0:9:28,22 --> 0:9:32,75
AZUZ: Unbelievable. College seniors lined
up the trick shot as part of the monthly class


135
0:9:32,75 --> 0:9:38,39
competition -- yes, they won. It wasn`t a
hole in one, though, it took them 28 tries


136
0:9:38,39 --> 0:9:43,12
to nail the shot. But they didn`t want to
cheat or cut any corners. When you are golfing,


137
0:9:43,12 --> 0:9:46,82
you aim for the fair way. I mean that`s just
part for the course. If other competitors


138
0:9:46,82 --> 0:9:51,12
were green with envy, they can try to top
this shot, they`ll have to putt up or shot


139
0:9:51,12 --> 0:9:54,8
up. That`s the whole story for today. Teachers,
we want your thoughts on today`s show. Use


140
