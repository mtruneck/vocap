1
0:0:1,22 --> 0:0:9,48
Aw yeah, word up Food Tube. It's Jamie Oliver
here, live from Hackney in London and we're


2
0:0:9,48 --> 0:0:16,34
here today to celebrate, Australia day!
Yeah, round of applause everyone.


3
0:0:16,34 --> 0:0:21,9
So, we're going to make beautiful pie. So
if you talk to an Australian they're pretty


4
0:0:21,9 --> 0:0:25,72
serious about their pies. So my Australian
brothers and sisters, let's share the love


5
0:0:25,72 --> 0:0:30,399
of pies with the rest of the world in Food
Tube. It's a great recipe, beautiful stewed


6
0:0:30,399 --> 0:0:37,5
meat and the best pastry ever. We're going
to make killer, Aussie pie.


7
0:0:37,5 --> 0:0:42,0
Let's do it now. First important thing. This
is one kilo if skirt steak here. So just slice


8
0:0:42,0 --> 0:0:47,89
it up in one centimetre slices. We're going
to go heavy on the black pepper, a heaped


9
0:0:47,89 --> 0:0:51,33
teaspoon.
Also, I'm going to go about half a nutmeg.


10
0:0:51,33 --> 0:0:56,68
Just going to grate that in. Going to go in
with a little bit of olive oil. About two


11
0:0:56,68 --> 0:1:1,62
tablespoons goes on the meat and a good pinch
of salt. And we're going to massage it up


12
0:1:1,62 --> 0:1:7,57
and that's the first bit of flavour happening.
Two pans, really hot and we want to brown


13
0:1:7,57 --> 0:1:12,49
that off guys. So I'm just going to wash my
hands. Next up we're going to go a little


14
0:1:12,49 --> 0:1:17,71
bit of olive oil into a pan, four nice sprigs
of rosemary into the oil.


15
0:1:17,71 --> 0:1:21,97
We';re going to go straight into the oil with
400 grams of carrots and onions, so let's


16
0:1:21,97 --> 0:1:26,9
really caramelise these beautiful veggies
here for another ten minutes. While that's


17
0:1:26,9 --> 0:1:39,77
happening let's cut to a little bit of DJ
BBQ and Gennaro Contaldo. Yes!


18
0:1:39,77 --> 0:1:49,5
Nice, thank you very much DJ BBQ and Gennaro,
beautiful stuff as usual. Now for a nice little


19
0:1:49,5 --> 0:1:55,299
bit of beer. Okay, the Aussies do make a fine
beer. So we're going to crack into a Coopers


20
0:1:55,299 --> 0:2:1,49
brewery original pale ale. And gi you love
beer then click on this bottle now because


21
0:2:1,49 --> 0:2:6,26
we have our brothers over the road, Craft
beer Channel and they're review this beer


22
0:2:6,26 --> 0:2:11,86
amongst other beers. So click over, have a
little look and subscribe. So back to the


23
0:2:11,86 --> 0:2:14,66
stew.
While this pan is super hot and it's dark


24
0:2:14,66 --> 0:2:19,3
right. We're going to go in with the beer.
About a quarter of a pint. We want to get


25
0:2:19,3 --> 0:2:23,1
all those sticky bits off the bottom of the
pan and once it's cooked away we want to thicken


26
0:2:23,1 --> 0:2:28,29
it up with one heaped tablespoon of flour.
We're going to stir that in now. We want a


27
0:2:28,29 --> 0:2:33,76
little edge of sweetness. So we love a little
bit of tomato puree. We love a little tablespoon.


28
0:2:33,76 --> 0:2:38,93
Stir that in and then go in with our lovely
caramelised veggies.


29
0:2:38,93 --> 0:2:44,53
Look at that! Sweet and gorgeous, so we've
built up a little base. Just go in now with


30
0:2:44,53 --> 0:2:48,9
about a pint of water.
We want to cover it with liquid.


31
0:2:48,9 --> 0:2:51,319
There's one thing I haven't done, and that's
the mushrooms.


32
0:2:51,319 --> 0:2:57,92
200 grams into the pan. I'm really pleased
with that intense flavour. I might just add


33
0:2:57,92 --> 0:3:3,76
a little bit more water and turn it right
down to a little simmer. Pop a lid on, cook


34
0:3:3,76 --> 0:3:9,489
that for about an hour, hour and half. I've
done a great little video to show you how


35
0:3:9,489 --> 0:3:16,29
to make the perfect cheesey pastry. Click
the link and watch it right now.


36
0:3:16,29 --> 0:3:25,319
Okay guys, so this has chilled out in the
fridge for about half an hour, an hour.


37
0:3:25,319 --> 0:3:30,48
I'm going to cut the pastry. One third goers
there.


38
0:3:30,48 --> 0:3:36,72
Get a pinch of flour and dust from a height.
Then I tend to just roll it out. We're always


39
0:3:36,72 --> 0:3:41,92
going to roll away from us. Roll ti about
the thickness of a pound coin. I'm going to


40
0:3:41,92 --> 0:3:49,5
put this over here. Put it over the rolling
pin and just roll it up. Lay it over and then


41
0:3:49,5 --> 0:3:56,239
very simply. Nice cut off the excess in half,
and in half again then just use a knife to


42
0:3:56,239 --> 0:4:4,269
cut off the excess. Fill our lovely pies here.
Look at that! So these little off cuts here.


43
0:4:4,269 --> 0:4:8,17
We can just squeeze them lightly back together
again. Roll out.


44
0:4:8,17 --> 0:4:13,67
Just going to cut it into quarters. I've got
a little egg wash here, that's just to stick


45
0:4:13,67 --> 0:4:20,72
it together. Get your pastry and put it oin
the top and again just cut the edge.


46
0:4:20,72 --> 0:4:29,5
And then use a fork and just squeeze our fork
here like this and then use thumb forefinger,


47
0:4:29,5 --> 0:4:35,4
and forefinger and give a good pinch like
that. But definitely something you want to


48
0:4:35,4 --> 0:4:39,66
do. Put a little cut like that in the top
to let the steam out, so ready to rock and


49
0:4:39,66 --> 0:4:44,8
roll. Is some beautiful little pies, again
some beautiful little egg wash on and around


50
0:4:44,8 --> 0:4:48,729
the central part. So this is going to go in
the oven, these are individuals portions so


51
0:4:48,729 --> 0:4:55,25
I'll cook that for about half an hour, forty
minutes for 180 degrees centigrade. Look at


52
0:4:55,25 --> 0:5:1,53
that! Beautiful golden rich crumbly pastry.
So there you go guys, a homage to our Australian


53
0:5:1,53 --> 0:5:3,91
brothers and sister.s
Happy Australia day!


54
0:5:3,91 --> 0:5:11,71
So just break into there. Get the pie open,
look at that! I mean, gorgeous filling, great


55
0:5:11,71 --> 0:5:16,12
pastry, It's off the chart good.
So there you go guys, a wonderful home made


56
0:5:16,12 --> 0:7:16,12
pie!
