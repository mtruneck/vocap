1
0:0:8,2 --> 0:0:10,588
this is a story about a world obsessed with stuff


2
0:0:10,588 --> 0:0:13,875
it's a story about a system in crisis. 


3
0:0:13,875 --> 0:0:14,917
we're trashing the planet


4
0:0:14,917 --> 0:0:16,625
we're trashing each other


5
0:0:16,625 --> 0:0:19,583
and we're not even having fun


6
0:0:19,583 --> 0:0:22,292
the good thing, is that when we start to understand the system


7
0:0:22,292 --> 0:0:27,42
we can see lots of places to step 
 in and turn these problems into solutions


8
0:0:27,42 --> 0:0:34,792
[music]


9
0:0:34,792 --> 0:0:39,333
one the problems with trying to use less stuff


10
0:0:39,333 --> 0:0:41,208
is that sometimes we feel like we really need it


11
0:0:41,208 --> 0:0:44,958
what if you live in a city like, say 
 cleveland, and you want a glass of water


12
0:0:44,958 --> 0:0:48,0
are you going to take your chances and get it from the city tap?


13
0:0:48,0 --> 0:0:51,792
or should you reach for a bottle of water 
 that comes from the pristine rainforests of


14
0:0:51,792 --> 0:0:52,875
Fiji?


15
0:0:52,875 --> 0:0:56,167
Well, Fiji brand water thought the answer to this question was obvious


16
0:0:56,167 --> 0:0:58,542
So they built a whole ad campaign around it


17
0:0:58,542 --> 0:1:0,667
it turned out to be one of the dumbest moves


18
0:1:0,667 --> 0:1:1,875
in advertising history


19
0:1:1,875 --> 0:1:4,0
the city of cleveland it like being the butt


20
0:1:4,0 --> 0:1:5,42
of fiji jokes


21
0:1:5,42 --> 0:1:7,25
so they did some tests and guess what?


22
0:1:7,25 --> 0:1:10,708
These tests showed a glass of Fiji water is lower quality


23
0:1:10,708 --> 0:1:13,958
it loses taste tests against Cleveland tap


24
0:1:13,958 --> 0:1:16,375
and costs thousands of times more


25
0:1:16,375 --> 0:1:19,25
this story is typical of what happens when


26
0:1:19,25 --> 0:1:20,958
you test bottled water against tap water


27
0:1:20,958 --> 0:1:21,917
is it cleaner?


28
0:1:21,917 --> 0:1:23,958
sometimes, sometimes not


29
0:1:23,958 --> 0:1:26,75
in many ways bottled water is less regulated


30
0:1:26,75 --> 0:1:27,542
than tap


31
0:1:27,542 --> 0:1:28,75
Is it tastier?


32
0:1:28,75 --> 0:1:31,792
In taste tests across the country, people consistently


33
0:1:31,792 --> 0:1:33,344
choose tap over bottled water.


34
0:1:33,344 --> 0:1:37,13
These bottled water companies say they're just meeting consumer demand


35
0:1:37,13 --> 0:1:39,583
but who would demand a less sustainable


36
0:1:39,583 --> 0:1:42,25
less tasty, way more expensive product


37
0:1:42,25 --> 0:1:45,292
especially one you can get almost free in your kitchen


38
0:1:45,292 --> 0:1:49,459
bottled water costs that two thousand times more than tap water


39
0:1:49,459 --> 0:1:52,542
Can you imagine paying 2000 times the price of anything else?


40
0:1:52,542 --> 0:1:54,833
how about a $10,000 sandwich?


41
0:1:54,833 --> 0:1:57,708
yet people in the US by more than half a billion


42
0:1:57,708 --> 0:1:59,0
gallons of water every week


43
0:1:59,0 --> 0:2:3,417
that is enough to circle the globe more than five times


44
0:2:3,417 --> 0:2:5,83
how did this come to be?


45
0:2:5,83 --> 0:2:8,333
well it all goes back to how our materials economy works


46
0:2:8,333 --> 0:2:12,458
and one of its key drivers which is known as manufactured demand


47
0:2:12,458 --> 0:2:14,208
if companies want to keep growing


48
0:2:14,208 --> 0:2:16,542
they have to keep selling more and more stuff


49
0:2:16,542 --> 0:2:19,417
in the 1970s giant soft drink companies


50
0:2:19,417 --> 0:2:21,417
got worried as they saw their growth projections


51
0:2:21,417 --> 0:2:22,625
starting to level off


52
0:2:22,625 --> 0:2:24,958
there's only so much soda that a person can drink


53
0:2:24,958 --> 0:2:27,417
Plus it wouldn't be long before people began


54
0:2:27,417 --> 0:2:29,375
realizing that soda is not that healthy


55
0:2:29,375 --> 0:2:32,75
and turned back to [gasp] drinking tap water.


56
0:2:32,75 --> 0:2:35,333
well the companies found their next big idea


57
0:2:35,333 --> 0:2:38,208
in a silly designer product that most people laughed off


58
0:2:38,208 --> 0:2:39,458
as a passing yuppie fad


59
0:2:39,458 --> 0:2:41,917
"Water is free," people said back then.


60
0:2:41,917 --> 0:2:44,25
"what will they sell us next, air?"


61
0:2:44,25 --> 0:2:47,25
so how do you get people to buy this fringe product?


62
0:2:47,25 --> 0:2:50,0
Simple. You manufacture demand


63
0:2:50,0 --> 0:2:51,5
How do you do that?


64
0:2:51,5 --> 0:2:54,83
Well, imagine you're in charge of the bottled water


65
0:2:54,83 --> 0:2:55,0
company


66
0:2:55,0 --> 0:2:57,583
Since people aren't lining up to trade their hard-earned money


67
0:2:57,583 --> 0:2:59,167
for you unnecessary product


68
0:2:59,167 --> 0:3:2,292
you make them feel scared and insecure if the don't have it


69
0:3:2,292 --> 0:3:5,458
and that's exactly what the bottled water industry did


70
0:3:5,458 --> 0:3:8,167
one of their first marketing tactics was to


71
0:3:8,167 --> 0:3:9,667
scare people about tap water


72
0:3:9,667 --> 0:3:12,208
with ads like Fiji's Cleveland campaign.


73
0:3:12,208 --> 0:3:15,625
""When were done," one top water exec said,


74
0:3:15,625 --> 0:3:19,83
"tap water will be relegated to showers and washing dishes."


75
0:3:19,83 --> 0:3:22,542
Next, you hide the reality of your product behind


76
0:3:22,542 --> 0:3:24,428
images of pure fantasy


77
0:3:24,428 --> 0:3:27,75
Have you ever noticed how bottled water tries to seduce us


78
0:3:27,75 --> 0:3:30,125
with pictures of mountains streams and pristine nature?


79
0:3:30,125 --> 0:3:33,391
But guess where a third of all bottled water in the U.S. actually


80
0:3:33,391 --> 0:3:34,708
comes from?


81
0:3:34,708 --> 0:3:36,542
The tap!


82
0:3:36,542 --> 0:3:38,875
Pepsi's Aquafina and Coke's Dasani


83
0:3:38,875 --> 0:3:41,875
are two of the many brands that are really filtered tap water


84
0:3:41,875 --> 0:3:44,542
But the pristine nature lie goes much deeper.


85
0:3:44,542 --> 0:3:47,375
In a recent full page ad, Nestlé said:


86
0:3:47,375 --> 0:3:50,167
"Bottled water is the most environmentally


87
0:3:50,167 --> 0:3:52,125
responsible consumer product in the world."


88
0:3:52,125 --> 0:3:53,175
What?!


89
0:3:53,175 --> 0:3:56,625
They are trashing the environment all along the product's life cycle.


90
0:3:56,625 --> 0:4:0,48
﻿﻿Exactly how is that environmentally responsible?


91
0:4:0,48 --> 0:4:3,417
The problems start here with extraction and production


92
0:4:3,417 --> 0:4:5,76
where oil is used to make water bottles


93
0:4:5,76 --> 0:4:8,593
Each year, making the plastic water bottles


94
0:4:8,593 --> 0:4:11,167
used in the U.S. takes enough oil and energy


95
0:4:11,167 --> 0:4:13,333
to fuel a million cars.


96
0:4:13,333 --> 0:4:15,375
All that energy spent to make the bottle


97
0:4:15,375 --> 0:4:18,625
even more to ship it around the planet


98
0:4:18,625 --> 0:4:22,542
and then we drink it in about 2 minutes?


99
0:4:22,542 --> 0:4:26,292
That brings us to the big problem at 
 the other end of the life cycle


100
0:4:26,292 --> 0:4:29,833
Disposal. What happens to all these bottles when we're done?


101
0:4:29,833 --> 0:4:32,542
Eighty percent end up in landfills,


102
0:4:32,542 --> 0:4:34,542
where they will sit for thousands of years,


103
0:4:34,542 --> 0:4:37,375
or in incinerators, where they are burned, releasing 


104
0:4:37,375 --> 0:4:38,667
toxic pollution.


105
0:4:38,667 --> 0:4:40,792
The rest gets collected for recycling.


106
0:4:40,792 --> 0:4:43,83
I was curious about where the plastic bottles


107
0:4:43,83 --> 0:4:44,833
that I put in recycling bins go.


108
0:4:44,833 --> 0:4:47,167
I found out that shiploads were being sent


109
0:4:47,167 --> 0:4:48,208
to India.


110
0:4:48,208 --> 0:4:49,333
So, I went there.


111
0:4:49,333 --> 0:4:52,417
I'll never forget riding over a hill outside Madras


112
0:4:52,417 --> 0:4:54,522
where I came face to face with a mountain


113
0:4:54,522 --> 0:4:56,375
of plastic bottles from California.


114
0:4:56,375 --> 0:4:58,376
Real recycling would turn these bottles


115
0:4:58,376 --> 0:4:59,833
back into bottles.


116
0:4:59,833 --> 0:5:3,583
But that wasn't what was happening here.


117
0:5:3,583 --> 0:5:6,583
Instead these bottles were slated to be downcycled,


118
0:5:6,583 --> 0:5:8,547
which means turning them into lower quality


119
0:5:8,547 --> 0:5:10,5
products that would just be chucked later.


120
0:5:10,5 --> 0:5:13,469
The parts that couldn't be downcycled were thrown away there


121
0:5:13,469 --> 0:5:16,125
shipped all the way to India just to be dumped in


122
0:5:16,125 --> 0:5:18,67
someone else's backyard.


123
0:5:18,67 --> 0:5:20,583
If bottled water companies want to use mountains 


124
0:5:20,583 --> 0:5:21,792
on their labels,


125
0:5:21,792 --> 0:5:23,5
it'd be more accurate to show one of these 


126
0:5:23,5 --> 0:5:25,375
mountains of plastic waste.


127
0:5:25,375 --> 0:5:28,958
Scaring us, seducing us, and misleading us


128
0:5:28,958 --> 0:5:33,299
 -- these strategies are all core parts of manufacturing demand


129
0:5:33,299 --> 0:5:35,958
Once they've manufactured all this demand,


130
0:5:35,958 --> 0:5:38,175
creating a new multibillion dollar market,


131
0:5:38,175 --> 0:5:40,875
they defend it by beating out the competition.


132
0:5:40,875 --> 0:5:42,417
But in this case,


133
0:5:42,417 --> 0:5:45,0
the competition is our basic human right to


134
0:5:45,0 --> 0:5:47,208
clean, safe drinking water.


135
0:5:47,208 --> 0:5:49,875
Pepsi's Vice Chairman publicly said,


136
0:5:49,875 --> 0:5:52,34
"The biggest enemy is tap water!"


137
0:5:52,34 --> 0:5:54,708
They want us to think it's dirty and bottled


138
0:5:54,708 --> 0:5:56,473
 water is the best alternative.


139
0:5:56,473 --> 0:5:59,83
In many places, public water is polluted


140
0:5:59,83 --> 0:6:1,83
thanks to polluting industries like


141
0:6:1,83 --> 0:6:2,792
the plastic bottle industry!


142
0:6:2,792 --> 0:6:5,208
And these bottled water guys are all too happy


143
0:6:5,208 --> 0:6:7,0
 to offer their expensive solutions


144
0:6:7,0 --> 0:6:9,167
which keep us hooked on their products.


145
0:6:9,167 --> 0:6:14,167
It's time we took back the tap.


146
0:6:14,167 --> 0:6:14,167
That starts with making a personal commitment


147
0:6:14,167 --> 0:6:17,292
 to not buy or drink bottled water unless the water


148
0:6:17,292 --> 0:6:19,667
 in your community is truly unhealthy.


149
0:6:19,667 --> 0:6:21,875
Yes, it takes a bit of foresight to grab a 


150
0:6:21,875 --> 0:6:24,667
reusable bottle on the way out, but I think we can handle it


151
0:6:24,667 --> 0:6:26,708
Then take the next step


152
0:6:26,708 --> 0:6:29,917
join a campaign that's working for real solutions.


153
0:6:29,917 --> 0:6:33,5
Like demanding investment in clean tap water for all


154
0:6:33,5 --> 0:6:37,458
In the US, tap water is underfunded by $24 billion


155
0:6:37,458 --> 0:6:40,173
partly because people believe drinking water 


156
0:6:40,173 --> 0:6:41,427
only comes from a bottle!


157
0:6:41,427 --> 0:6:43,458
Around the world, a billion people don't


158
0:6:43,458 --> 0:6:45,5
 have access to clean water right now.


159
0:6:45,5 --> 0:6:49,43
Yet cities all over are spending millions of dollars to deal with all


160
0:6:49,43 --> 0:6:51,292
 the plastic bottles we throw out.


161
0:6:51,292 --> 0:6:54,0
What if that money were spent improving our water  systems


162
0:6:54,0 --> 0:6:56,792
or better yet, preventing pollution to begin with?


163
0:6:56,792 --> 0:7:0,375
There are many more things we can do to solve this problem.


164
0:7:0,375 --> 0:7:3,167
Lobby your city officials to bring back drinking fountains


165
0:7:3,167 --> 0:7:5,333
Work to ban the purchase of bottled water


166
0:7:5,333 --> 0:7:8,25
by your school, organization or entire city


167
0:7:8,25 --> 0:7:12,83
This is a huge opportunity for millions of people to wake up


168
0:7:12,83 --> 0:7:13,458
and protect our wallets,


169
0:7:13,458 --> 0:7:14,542
our health


170
0:7:14,542 --> 0:7:15,667
and the planet.


171
0:7:15,667 --> 0:7:17,833
The good news is: it's already started.


172
0:7:17,833 --> 0:7:21,333
Bottled water sales have begun to drop while business is booming


173
0:7:21,333 --> 0:7:24,208
for safe refillable water bottles. Yay!


174
0:7:24,208 --> 0:7:26,25
Restaurants are proudly serving "tap"


175
0:7:26,25 --> 0:7:29,125
and people are choosing to pocket the hundred of thousands


176
0:7:29,125 --> 0:7:30,833
of dollars they would otherwise be wasting


177
0:7:30,833 --> 0:7:32,0
on bottled water


178
0:7:32,0 --> 0:7:34,333
Carrying bottled water is on its way to being


179
0:7:34,333 --> 0:7:36,375
as cool as smoking while pregnant.


180
0:7:36,375 --> 0:7:38,25
We know better now.


181
0:7:38,25 --> 0:7:40,792
The bottled water industry is getting worried


182
0:7:40,792 --> 0:7:42,42
because the jig is up.


183
0:7:42,42 --> 0:7:43,542
We are not buying into their


184
0:7:43,542 --> 0:7:45,42
manufactured demand anymore.


185
0:7:45,42 --> 0:7:46,721
We will choose our own demands, 


186
0:7:46,721 --> 0:7:46,721
thank you very much, and we're demanding clean, safe water for all


187
0:7:46,721 --> 0:9:46,721
thank you very much, and we're demanding clean, safe water for all
