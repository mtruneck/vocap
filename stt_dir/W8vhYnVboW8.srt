[MUSIC PLAYING]


3
0:0:11,24 --> 0:0:14,27
BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah, so you know
if the rest of you guys


4
0:0:14,27 --> 0:0:17,45
split we can all just
partnership with Trav, film,


5
0:0:17,45 --> 0:0:19,18
and like, these jumps
are already built.


6
0:0:19,18 --> 0:0:22,4
So it's really just a matter
of going out and just


7
0:0:22,4 --> 0:0:22,8
sessioning.


8
0:0:22,8 --> 0:0:24,13
And these guys are pros.


9
0:0:24,13 --> 0:0:26,176
That's why, my gut feelings is
just to stick with our plan


10
0:0:26,176 --> 0:0:29,475
and not try to start
from scratch again.


11
0:0:29,475 --> 0:0:31,21
Because, I think we've
been out there.


12
0:0:31,21 --> 0:0:32,34
We know the snow's good.


13
0:0:32,34 --> 0:0:33,93
And we know what's going on.


14
0:0:33,93 --> 0:0:37,64
We're confident in what
we can do, at least.


15
0:0:37,64 --> 0:0:40,36
And then just to reset a whole
new plan, right now, I think,


16
0:0:40,36 --> 0:0:42,28
would be counterproductive.


17
0:0:42,28 --> 0:0:44,3
PAT BRIDGES: Probably around
the time that Subjekt


18
0:0:44,3 --> 0:0:47,32
Haakonsen and those movies, he
moved to Jackson Hole, which


19
0:0:47,32 --> 0:0:49,88
is like the big mountain mecca,
as far as the lower 48


20
0:0:49,88 --> 0:0:50,87
states goes.


21
0:0:50,87 --> 0:0:54,16
Here's a guy who consciously
went against what was


22
0:0:54,16 --> 0:0:57,3
marketable about him, what his
sponsors expected of him, but


23
0:0:57,3 --> 0:1:0,29
he did what he had to
do as a snowboarder.


24
0:1:0,29 --> 0:1:2,83
DAVE DOWNING: I know we went to
Jackson Hole, actually, I


25
0:1:2,83 --> 0:1:3,59
remember the trip.


26
0:1:3,59 --> 0:1:5,65
It was with Standard Films.


27
0:1:5,65 --> 0:1:9,33
We were filming for this, I
think it was TV5, and we had a


28
0:1:9,33 --> 0:1:11,33
really sick week in
Jackson Hole.


29
0:1:11,33 --> 0:1:12,16
It was super sick.


30
0:1:12,16 --> 0:1:13,53
Like powder, epic.


31
0:1:13,53 --> 0:1:15,7
We were filming on the
resort and stuff.


32
0:1:15,7 --> 0:1:18,99
And I think he just fell in love
with the place, you know?


33
0:1:18,99 --> 0:1:23,9
And he just made a decision to
just live there, and just


34
0:1:23,9 --> 0:1:24,8
became a mountain man.


35
0:1:24,8 --> 0:1:26,63
KEVIN JONES: And I believe
that next year, I believe


36
0:1:26,63 --> 0:1:28,97
that's when, I think, Burton
dropped him, basically for


37
0:1:28,97 --> 0:1:30,86
moving to Jackson Hole,
of all things.


38
0:1:30,86 --> 0:1:32,76
It's like, oh you could never
be a professional


39
0:1:32,76 --> 0:1:34,47
snowboarder out there.


40
0:1:34,47 --> 0:1:36,91
He was so ahead of his time.


41
0:1:36,91 --> 0:1:40,93
And I think that he really found
himself, in a lot of


42
0:1:40,93 --> 0:1:42,11
ways, and what his snowboarding


43
0:1:42,11 --> 0:1:43,46
was going to be about.


44
0:1:43,46 --> 0:1:45,61
MIKE RANQUET: He moved there at
a time when his career was


45
0:1:45,61 --> 0:1:46,58
pretty high.


46
0:1:46,58 --> 0:1:49,64
And he didn't just move there,
he disappeared there.


47
0:1:49,64 --> 0:1:53,11
And he didn't go there
for fame and glory.


48
0:1:53,11 --> 0:1:56,1
He went there for mountains
and snow.


49
0:1:56,1 --> 0:1:57,43
BRYAN IGUCHI: I was at
a point where I felt


50
0:1:57,43 --> 0:1:58,96
stagnant in my riding.


51
0:1:58,96 --> 0:2:2,66
And I saw the only progression
as be a big mountain,


52
0:2:2,66 --> 0:2:4,5
freestyle, snowboarder.


53
0:2:4,5 --> 0:2:7,96
And that was the way, where
I saw the sport going.


54
0:2:7,96 --> 0:2:10,22
And that's why I wanted my film
parts to be able to get


55
0:2:10,22 --> 0:2:13,23
these tricks off cliffs, or
off natural kickers in the


56
0:2:13,23 --> 0:2:13,77
back country.


57
0:2:13,77 --> 0:2:17,16
And that's what I saw
as my progression.


58
0:2:17,16 --> 0:2:18,41
WILLIE MCMILLON: He was
a pretty big deal.


59
0:2:18,41 --> 0:2:21,83
Jackson was still pretty
low key at that time.


60
0:2:21,83 --> 0:2:27,94
And I've always been pretty
protective of this place.


61
0:2:27,94 --> 0:2:31,89
So when he moved here, I don't
know if I was threatened by


62
0:2:31,89 --> 0:2:33,2
some big name coming here.


63
0:2:33,2 --> 0:2:37,63
Or just kind of worried
about him blowing this


64
0:2:37,63 --> 0:2:38,67
place out, or something.


65
0:2:38,67 --> 0:2:42,24
But I kind of gave him
a pretty hard time


66
0:2:42,24 --> 0:2:42,95
when he moved here.


67
0:2:42,95 --> 0:2:45,93
I don't even know if he even
knew I was vibing him.


68
0:2:45,93 --> 0:2:50,3
But I was just kind
of a dick to him.


69
0:2:50,3 --> 0:2:53,186
BRYAN IGUCHI: I had a
realization, I think, that I


70
0:2:53,186 --> 0:2:54,41
was this professional
snowboarder and I didn't


71
0:2:54,41 --> 0:2:56,45
really know anything about
the mountains.


72
0:2:56,45 --> 0:2:57,46
You know?


73
0:2:57,46 --> 0:2:59,5
I knew how to ride
a snowboard.


74
0:2:59,5 --> 0:3:0,96
I knew how to do tricks.


75
0:3:0,96 --> 0:3:3,16
But I didn't know
anything about


76
0:3:3,16 --> 0:3:5,49
avalanches, or what was possible.


77
0:3:5,49 --> 0:3:7,57
Or how to get around the
mountain safely.


78
0:3:7,57 --> 0:3:10,545
The reality sank in that, man,
this is a dangerous pursuit.


79
0:3:10,545 --> 0:3:14,92
And I've got to get to
know what I'm riding.


80
0:3:14,92 --> 0:3:18,51
And I wanted to explore more
of the back country.


81
0:3:18,51 --> 0:3:20,27
WILLIE MCMILLON: He
played it so cool.


82
0:3:20,27 --> 0:3:24,29
He didn't come into town and
just bring all these crews in,


83
0:3:24,29 --> 0:3:26,3
and do all this shit,
whatever.


84
0:3:26,3 --> 0:3:31,82
He like, laid really low and
just kind of naturally became


85
0:3:31,82 --> 0:3:33,1
part of the scene.


86
0:3:33,1 --> 0:3:36,31
We're like, this guy's got to
be pretty cool if he gave up


87
0:3:36,31 --> 0:3:39,35
all this fame and stuff, in
California, to come out here


88
0:3:39,35 --> 0:3:41,0
and just hideout,
and ride powder.


89
0:3:41,0 --> 0:3:43,41
BRYAN IGUCHI: It was kind
of like a career


90
0:3:43,41 --> 0:3:45,46
suicide, in a sense.


91
0:3:45,46 --> 0:3:48,47
It was taking myself out of
everything that I had built,


92
0:3:48,47 --> 0:3:52,9
the snowboard park, freestyle
snowboarding thing.


93
0:3:52,9 --> 0:3:53,69
And just going exactly
opposite.


94
0:3:53,69 --> 0:3:58,45
I wanted to keep snowboarding
fun for myself, not for


95
0:3:58,45 --> 0:3:59,7
necessarily my sponsors.


96
0:3:59,7 --> 0:4:1,77
I saw a different
way to progress.


97
0:4:1,77 --> 0:4:3,69
PAT BRIDGES: He was the first
rider to sit there and put his


98
0:4:3,69 --> 0:4:4,67
money where his mouth was.


99
0:4:4,67 --> 0:4:6,55
A lot of people are like, oh
yeah, I'm going to go and I'm


100
0:4:6,55 --> 0:4:10,19
going to work on big mountain
freestyle, and make it


101
0:4:10,19 --> 0:4:12,15
technical in the
big mountains.


102
0:4:12,15 --> 0:4:13,78
He really laid it
all on the line.


103
0:4:13,78 --> 0:4:16,24
And for a while, I mean, he
kind of paid the price.


104
0:4:16,24 --> 0:4:18,92
Because it wasn't what
his sponsors, at the


105
0:4:18,92 --> 0:4:21,23
time, wanted from him.


106
0:4:21,23 --> 0:4:23,53
So he was kind of in
the wilderness, as


107
0:4:23,53 --> 0:4:24,6
far as that's concerned.


108
0:4:24,6 --> 0:4:26,37
But I mean, he was
riding every day.


109
0:4:26,37 --> 0:4:27,71
WILLIE MCMILLON: He was
here for a while.


110
0:4:27,71 --> 0:4:30,6
I think his sponsors were
cool with it, whatever.


111
0:4:30,6 --> 0:4:35,59
And then it just seemed like
at one point it was just a


112
0:4:35,59 --> 0:4:38,375
domino effect of his sponsors
dropping him.


113
0:4:38,375 --> 0:4:39,93
You know?


114
0:4:39,93 --> 0:4:42,65
And at one point he was
printing t-shirts for


115
0:4:42,65 --> 0:4:45,84
Bluebird, getting like
$10 an hour.


116
0:4:45,84 --> 0:4:50,51
He was just back in the working
class, dealing with


117
0:4:50,51 --> 0:4:52,98
like, what the fuck
do I do now?


118
0:4:52,98 --> 0:4:53,93
BRYAN IGUCHI: I just
kept snowboarding.


119
0:4:53,93 --> 0:4:57,56
Because whether I was making
good money or not, I was still


120
0:4:57,56 --> 0:5:0,4
doing whatever I had
to do to snowboard.


121
0:5:0,4 --> 0:5:3,88
I started apprenticing as a
sushi chef, and working at the


122
0:5:3,88 --> 0:5:4,77
local sushi bar.


123
0:5:4,77 --> 0:5:9,2
And I just kept riding, though,
regardless of what was


124
0:5:9,2 --> 0:5:13,6
going on with my sponsors, or
with my career, I guess.


125
0:5:13,6 --> 0:5:15,1
It was just more about
the riding.


126
0:5:15,1 --> 0:5:18,23
WILLIE MCMILLON: And it was just
kind of a crazy winter.


127
0:5:18,23 --> 0:5:21,57
Because you would just kind of
see this aftermath of that


128
0:5:21,57 --> 0:5:24,27
crew up on the mountain.


129
0:5:24,27 --> 0:5:27,62
And that's kind of when I
started to maybe really have a


130
0:5:27,62 --> 0:5:29,7
lot of respect for him.


131
0:5:29,7 --> 0:5:32,2
You didn't see those guys hit
anything, but you just saw


132
0:5:32,2 --> 0:5:32,85
their lines.


133
0:5:32,85 --> 0:5:36,3
And people would be like, oh
yeah, Guch did this today, and


134
0:5:36,3 --> 0:5:38,58
Johann did that.


135
0:5:38,58 --> 0:5:41,27
I was kind of bummed, at that
point, that I was like such a


136
0:5:41,27 --> 0:5:44,4
dick to him, because I was like,
I want to go shred with


137
0:5:44,4 --> 0:5:45,65
those dudes, you know?


138
0:5:45,65 --> 0:5:47,6
TRAVIS RICE: We were out
at Teton Village


139
0:5:47,6 --> 0:5:48,97
riding here, in Jackson.


140
0:5:48,97 --> 0:5:52,6
One day were out there in the
morning, and they used to have


141
0:5:52,6 --> 0:5:56,81
this tram tower that had a clock
with a bell on it, and


142
0:5:56,81 --> 0:5:58,56
it would ring like every hour.


143
0:5:58,56 --> 0:6:0,98
It was like gong, gong.


144
0:6:0,98 --> 0:6:3,596
My buddy and I were walking
along the path, going up to


145
0:6:3,596 --> 0:6:4,77
the ski resort.


146
0:6:4,77 --> 0:6:5,32
We're rolling out.


147
0:6:5,32 --> 0:6:9,33
My buddy stops me and we both
look up, and here's Johan and


148
0:6:9,33 --> 0:6:11,66
Bryan Iguchi like walking.


149
0:6:11,66 --> 0:6:12,82
And it was so weird.


150
0:6:12,82 --> 0:6:15,49
I remember it so specifically
to this day.


151
0:6:15,49 --> 0:6:19,21
Right at that moment, dude,
the hour clock gonged.


152
0:6:19,21 --> 0:6:21,78
And it was like, I think
it was nine gongs long.


153
0:6:21,78 --> 0:6:23,216
It was like right at the
beginning of the day.


154
0:6:23,216 --> 0:6:27,55
And just, gong, this thing was
like, it was slow motion.


155
0:6:27,55 --> 0:6:30,23
And sure enough,
Bryan and Johan


156
0:6:30,23 --> 0:6:31,96
Olofsson go walking along.


157
0:6:31,96 --> 0:6:33,73
BRYAN IGUCHI: As a snowboarder
that was only way I was going


158
0:6:33,73 --> 0:6:34,24
to progress.


159
0:6:34,24 --> 0:6:37,61
It was going to be doing another
rotation off a jump.


160
0:6:37,61 --> 0:6:40,67
I wasn't really that interested
in continuing to


161
0:6:40,67 --> 0:6:42,67
keep spinning into oblivion.


162
0:6:42,67 --> 0:6:45,813
I wanted to be able to ride a
big mountain, and be able to


163
0:6:45,813 --> 0:6:46,71
ride a steep line.


164
0:6:46,71 --> 0:6:49,6
And be able to do tricks
within that line.


165
0:6:49,6 --> 0:6:53,92
And basically, Travis Rice is
exactly what I wanted to be.


166
0:6:53,92 --> 0:6:55,56
That's kind of funny.


167
0:6:55,56 --> 0:6:57,92
I might not have achieved
it, but it was cool


168
0:6:57,92 --> 0:7:0,95
seeing him do it.


169
0:7:0,95 --> 0:7:2,43
TRAVIS RICE: Seeing Guch,
every now and then, even


170
0:7:2,43 --> 0:7:8,27
though he was a resident at
that point, it was kind of


171
0:7:8,27 --> 0:7:11,81
like seeing an albino Buffalo,
or something rare.


172
0:7:11,81 --> 0:7:16,87
Something mystical, perhaps, I
don't know, some type of horse


173
0:7:16,87 --> 0:7:19,58
with a horn coming
straight out.


174
0:7:19,58 --> 0:7:22,14
He's a mystical creature
that lived in Jackson.


175
0:7:22,14 --> 0:7:23,51
You never saw him though.


176
0:7:23,51 --> 0:7:25,66
He's like an owl.


177
0:7:25,66 --> 0:7:27,26
BRYAN IGUCHI: My riding's
evolved.


178
0:7:27,26 --> 0:7:28,28
And it's still evolving.


179
0:7:28,28 --> 0:7:32,3
I'm progressing more on trying
to educate myself and get in


180
0:7:32,3 --> 0:7:34,87
my head wrapped around
the mountains.


181
0:7:34,87 --> 0:7:37,29
And trying to do what I
do, and do it safely.


182
0:7:37,29 --> 0:7:40,262
And it's all timing
in the mountains.


183
0:7:40,262 --> 0:7:43,43
And you've got to get out
there when it's good.


184
0:7:43,43 --> 0:7:47,71
And you've got to know
when to pull back.


185
0:7:47,71 --> 0:7:50,82
TRAVIS RICE: So yeah, years went
on, years went on, and


186
0:7:50,82 --> 0:7:53,21
the Guch actually took me
into the back country


187
0:7:53,21 --> 0:7:54,3
for the first time.


188
0:7:54,3 --> 0:7:57,32
Later that year, the same
filmer, Rich Goodwin, actually


189
0:7:57,32 --> 0:8:1,77
invited me down to tag along
with Lance Pitman and Bryan


190
0:8:1,77 --> 0:8:4,83
Iguchi go down to go to
Superpark, which was this big


191
0:8:4,83 --> 0:8:7,47
event that they do in Mammoth
Lakes, California.


192
0:8:7,47 --> 0:8:9,15
Which is like this big
park they built.


193
0:8:9,15 --> 0:8:11,48
They invite all the pros in
the world, come shred.


194
0:8:11,48 --> 0:8:15,47
And I went down there, I wasn't
invited but Guch was


195
0:8:15,47 --> 0:8:18,26
able to have some kind words
with the guys that were


196
0:8:18,26 --> 0:8:19,12
putting the event on.


197
0:8:19,12 --> 0:8:20,54
And got me in.


198
0:8:20,54 --> 0:8:25,11
And I ended up, after like five
or six days, getting MPV


199
0:8:25,11 --> 0:8:27,34
Superpark, which is kind
of how I got started in


200
0:8:27,34 --> 0:8:28,723
snowboarding.


201
0:8:28,723 --> 0:8:31,76
BRYAN IGUCHI: These photos are
taken by Ari Marcopoulos in, I


202
0:8:31,76 --> 0:8:33,37
think, 1997.


203
0:8:33,37 --> 0:8:35,885
Yeah, this is kind of the first
years here in Jackson.


204
0:8:35,885 --> 0:8:42,12
And you had like Jamie Lynn,
and Terry, Johan.


205
0:8:42,12 --> 0:8:45,34
Johan actually lived here for
a little bit then, in '97.


206
0:8:45,34 --> 0:8:47,82
Spent two season's
out here with me.


207
0:8:47,82 --> 0:8:48,97
Grillo lived with me, as well.


208
0:8:48,97 --> 0:8:50,62
And my buddy, Tim.


209
0:8:50,62 --> 0:8:52,365
We grew up together
in California and


210
0:8:52,365 --> 0:8:53,46
moved out here together.


211
0:8:53,46 --> 0:8:55,575
Kind of came here for a season,
to Jackson Hole, and


212
0:8:55,575 --> 0:8:58,65
ended 16 years later
still doing it.


213
0:8:58,65 --> 0:9:0,82



214
0:9:0,82 --> 0:9:2,59
PAT BRIDGES: It wasn't
coincidence that he was out


215
0:9:2,59 --> 0:9:5,41
there on the hill when the
cameras came back to find him


216
0:9:5,41 --> 0:9:8,3
in Jackson, because he would
be riding, no matter what.


217
0:9:8,3 --> 0:9:11,94
He would be rolling
sushi at night and


218
0:9:11,94 --> 0:9:13,3
riding during the day.


219
0:9:13,3 --> 0:9:14,94
That's what Guch did.


220
0:9:14,94 --> 0:9:18,77
Anybody who went to Jackson,
for the last 15 years, you


221
0:9:18,77 --> 0:9:20,94
knew you could find him
in the lift line.


222
0:9:20,94 --> 0:9:22,74
That's what he did.


223
0:9:22,74 --> 0:9:26,87
And unlike a lot of other people
in his peer group from


224
0:9:26,87 --> 0:9:31,72
that first big early '90s,
freestyle movement, a lot of


225
0:9:31,72 --> 0:9:35,13
those guys maybe they wanted
to do what Guch did.


226
0:9:35,13 --> 0:9:37,5
Maybe they tried, but they
didn't have the patience that


227
0:9:37,5 --> 0:9:40,21
he had, for the sport to
catch back up on him.


228
0:9:40,21 --> 0:9:41,72
WILLIE MCMILLON: He wasn't
even like getting paid or


229
0:9:41,72 --> 0:9:43,125
anything to snowboard.


230
0:9:43,125 --> 0:9:50,34
He started shooting with the
Grenade and somehow he just


231
0:9:50,34 --> 0:9:55,5
like carved his way
back in with this


232
0:9:55,5 --> 0:9:58,44
eternal legend status.


233
0:9:58,44 --> 0:10:1,41
There's like this or three year
period where he was just


234
0:10:1,41 --> 0:10:5,6
working his ass off, filming
every single day, just like


235
0:10:5,6 --> 0:10:8,7
stepping up his riding,
everything.


236
0:10:8,7 --> 0:10:11,32
Before you knew it, he was just
like, back in the mags,


237
0:10:11,32 --> 0:10:13,19
back in videos.


238
0:10:13,19 --> 0:10:15,54
Volcom picks him back up.


239
0:10:15,54 --> 0:10:18,3
All this great stuff started
happening for me.


240
0:10:18,3 --> 0:10:19,5
And now he's where
he's at now.


241
0:10:19,5 --> 0:10:23,41
And he's like the dude that
everybody calls when


242
0:10:23,41 --> 0:10:24,23
they come to town.


243
0:10:24,23 --> 0:10:27,5
DAVE DOWNING: Yeah, some people
could say, Bryan's


244
0:10:27,5 --> 0:10:27,645
making a comeback.


245
0:10:27,645 --> 0:10:29,84
Or he's a sponsored
snowboarder again.


246
0:10:29,84 --> 0:10:30,94
And that's true.


247
0:10:30,94 --> 0:10:33,13
But I don't think Bryan
really went anywhere.


248
0:10:33,13 --> 0:10:35,17
He was still snowboarding.


249
0:10:35,17 --> 0:10:37,18
He just wasn't doing it
in front of a camera.


250
0:10:37,18 --> 0:10:40,2
WILLIE MCMILLON: And him and
Lance Pitman just started


251
0:10:40,2 --> 0:10:42,7
exploring all these mountains.


252
0:10:42,7 --> 0:10:47,34
And I'd probably say that Guch
and Lance found 90% of the


253
0:10:47,34 --> 0:10:51,1
spots that people are
filming at now.


254
0:10:51,1 --> 0:10:52,91
Now Guch brings--


255
0:10:52,91 --> 0:10:54,55
he's got to show the
Volcom crew around,


256
0:10:54,55 --> 0:10:55,3
and all that stuff.


257
0:10:55,3 --> 0:10:59,0
But it's kind of like, well he
kind of found all these spots.


258
0:10:59,0 --> 0:11:0,1
TRAVIS RICE: He came
in, fresh eyes.


259
0:11:0,1 --> 0:11:4,16
He's like, there's mountains
360 degrees


260
0:11:4,16 --> 0:11:5,78
around Jackson Hole.


261
0:11:5,78 --> 0:11:7,79
That's why it's called a hole.


262
0:11:7,79 --> 0:11:10,4
Wonder what's up there,
or up there?


263
0:11:10,4 --> 0:11:12,62
So he set off on a quest
to go to discover what


264
0:11:12,62 --> 0:11:13,62
the hell was up there.


265
0:11:13,62 --> 0:11:18,2
And I was lucky enough to get
on board years later.


266
0:11:18,2 --> 0:11:21,88
And he kind of showed
me the ropes.


267
0:11:21,88 --> 0:11:24,67
WILLIE MCMILLON: It's kind of
the place where when people


268
0:11:24,67 --> 0:11:28,1
just get over the nonsense,
they come out here.


269
0:11:28,1 --> 0:11:30,93
And now there's like enough
cool people out here, that


270
0:11:30,93 --> 0:11:32,61
it's accepted.


271
0:11:32,61 --> 0:11:34,5
Like, I'm moving to Jackson,
and your sponsors


272
0:11:34,5 --> 0:11:35,84
are like, right on.


273
0:11:35,84 --> 0:11:38,14
BRYAN FOX: For like a kid in
Southern California to see


274
0:11:38,14 --> 0:11:41,75
someone from Southern California
leave and turn into


275
0:11:41,75 --> 0:11:47,4
a back country, more or less
like wilderness snowboarder


276
0:11:47,4 --> 0:11:50,7
type of guys, that's definitely
inspiring.


277
0:11:50,7 --> 0:11:52,23
WILLIE MCMILLON: I think
Harrison Ford is


278
0:11:52,23 --> 0:11:53,46
kind of like the Guch.


279
0:11:53,46 --> 0:11:58,31
You know, like, Harrison Ford
made it cool for Hollywood


280
0:11:58,31 --> 0:11:59,52
people to move out here.


281
0:11:59,52 --> 0:12:3,28
And Guch made it cool for pro
snowboarders to move out here.


282
0:12:3,28 --> 0:12:4,17
-Oh, good.


283
0:12:4,17 --> 0:12:5,766
We got all the dirt on you
now. dirt on you now.


284
0:12:5,766 --> 0:12:6,72
BRYAN IGUCHI: Oh, no.


285
0:12:6,72 --> 0:12:8,46
WILLIE MCMILLON: I talked so
much shit, dude, it wasn't


286
0:12:8,46 --> 0:12:10,34
even funny.


287
0:12:10,34 --> 0:12:12,262
No, I kept it clean.


288
0:12:12,262 --> 0:12:13,585
-Your career is over.


289
0:12:13,585 --> 0:12:14,467
BRYAN IGUCHI: Damn it.


290
0:12:14,467 --> 0:12:15,75
You spoiled it.


291
0:12:15,75 --> 0:12:17,4
WILLIE MCMILLON: No.


292
0:12:17,4 --> 0:12:19,24
We kept it family style.


293
0:12:19,24 --> 0:14:19,24
