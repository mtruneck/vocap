Hi, Mireya Mayor. While I usually explore remote 
corners of the world to push the boundaries of adventure, 


2
0:0:13,689 --> 0:0:15,859
and to inspire people to care about the planet,


3
0:0:15,859 --> 0:0:21,379
when I'm home, I have just as much fun exploring 
our corner of the world with my family.


4
0:0:21,379 --> 0:0:25,379
These are my daughters Emma and Eva and today 
we're going to explore our local park.


5
0:0:25,379 --> 0:0:34,379
Let's go! Let's go!


6
0:0:34,379 --> 0:0:39,0
Whether you have fifteen minutes or a full day, 
there are so many wonderful lessons


7
0:0:39,0 --> 0:0:43,0
for young explorers to experience locally.


8
0:0:43,0 --> 0:0:49,0
Whether it's the backyard, the park, or a nearby beach, 
there are many things to explore.


9
0:0:49,0 --> 0:0:55,0
Some things I always like to bring along are 
a digital camera.


10
0:0:55,0 --> 0:1:1,0
Photographs are a great way for children to show 
how they see the world. 


11
0:1:1,0 --> 0:1:7,0
A magnifying glass, to look closely at a piece of grass, 
flower, or insect,


12
0:1:7,0 --> 0:1:14,0
a net to catch little critters,


13
0:1:14,0 --> 0:1:19,0
a little notebook to document what you found,


14
0:1:19,0 --> 0:1:24,0
and binoculars, to take a closer look.


15
0:1:24,0 --> 0:1:30,0
Remind your children to be gentle with whatever 
they discover.


16
0:1:30,0 --> 0:1:34,0
For me, the most important thing is just to get outside,


17
0:1:34,0 --> 0:1:40,0
and most often, adventure will find you.


18
0:1:40,0 --> 0:1:44,0
You can find more tips, ideas, and great activities 
for exploring your surroundings
