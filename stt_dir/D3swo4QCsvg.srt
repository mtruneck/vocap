ADRI MURGUIA: Despite removing
himself from the society,


4
0:0:28,38 --> 0:0:30,83
Faustino's lifestyle began to
change when civilization


5
0:0:30,83 --> 0:0:32,79
started catching up with him.


6
0:0:32,79 --> 0:0:35,24
Just two years ago, the
government found out he had

0:0:35,24 --> 0:0:36,4
guns on his property.


8
0:0:36,4 --> 0:0:38,285
And they cut a deal with him
in which he would exchange


9
0:0:38,285 --> 0:0:41,3
them for solar panels, which
he doesn't really use.


10
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:43,35

series of changes that would


11
0:0:43,35 --> 0:0:45,66

his lifestyle.

biggest change that has

unlikely friendship with an
