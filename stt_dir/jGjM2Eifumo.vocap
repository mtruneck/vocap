###28 AZUZ: Fridays are awesome. I love starting with I-reports like that one from Ms. Tiffany`s
###34 class. I`m Carl Azuz. This is our March, 1st edition of CNN STUDENT NEWS. It`s also a deadline
###40 for the U.S. government. About $85 billion were set to be eliminated from the federal
###45 budget, unless Congress and the president can agree on the way around these automatic
###49 spending cuts. That`s not expected to happen, even though none of the politicians really
###54 likes these cuts. Here`s the basic problem: the government spends far more than it takes
###59 in. But neither the executive branch, nor the legislative branch has total control over
###65 what the government spends money on. And they disagree on how to tax and how to spend. So,
###70 these cuts are set to kick in the lower government spending, and one big question is, are most
###75 Americans going to notice?

###77 TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: If you would listen to only the White House, you would
###80 have the sense that we are going to a sequestration nation pretty soon, and that everybody would
###86 be hit in all these different areas: food safety and education and our tax returns or
###90 national parks - everything - and this seems to be true. If you are the right person doing
###96 the right thing, you in fact may see an effect here. For example, if you are in a military
###102 town, and you rely on military business, you might see an impact fairly soon. If you are
###105 at the airport waiting for the right flight at the right busy time, you might have a delay.
###110 If you are waiting on unemployment benefits and the check comes in lighter than, you expect,
###114 that would also be a real effect on you fairly soon, but notice I`m talking about specific
###120 groups of people doing specific things. The broader picture of the whole country may be
###126 different, and to address that I want to talk about one of the hardest things that came
###129 up today, Eric Holder speaking up, and he had this point to say in the middle of today
###133 where he said, look, we will be less safe, if our budget adjusted (ph) cut next year
###139 from 27 billion by 1.6 billion, to 25.4 billion. If these cut happens the nation will be less
###146 safe These are his words. And this is why he says that: because he says, there will
###151 be furloughs at the FBI we`ll have fewer people looking into crimes and trying to prevent
###155 crimes. ATF inspections of things like gun permits, all of that, will be knocked down
###159 a little bit, there will be fewer people to man the prisons, so prison will spend more
###162 time on lockdowns, there will fewer grants for local law enforcement. All of this will
###166 make things less safe in the country, according to him.
###170 This is the budget, if it gets the sequester. $25.4 billion for next year. That`s much it
###176 would get. But look at this; this is a graph of funding for the Justice Department for
###180 the last 11 years. And if you`ll notice, when you look at this graph, in fact, that line
###185 would be right about here. So, in fact, for the past 11 years only the past three years
###194 has the Justice Department had more money than they would have under the sequester.
###198 So, does that mean that all these years we were less safe? When the national crime rate
###203 was steadily moving down during that period of time? These are the tough challenges out
###207 there, because in many ways, as Democrats in the White House say, all these cataclysmic
###211 things are going to hit if the sequester comes in. I think Republicans maybe betting on the
###215 idea if a few weeks pass, a couple of months pass, and the public doesn`t notice it, because
###220 of things like this, then they are going to be able to turn around to the White House
###223 and say, you were just trying to scare us. You said a lot of things, and we haven`t seen
###229 it come to pass.

###231 AZUZ: At 2:00 Eastern, yesterday afternoon, the doors of a papal retreat closed. It signified
###235 the official end of Pope Benedict XVI papacy. And it followed a day of good byes. In this
###241 last public appearances, Pope Benedict said he was a pilgrim beginning the last leg of
###245 his pilgrimage on earth. In his last tweet as pope, Benedict wrote, "Thank you for your
###250 love and support. May you always experience the joy that comes from putting Christ in
###254 the center of your lives. This is historic, in part, because it`s the first time in 600
###260 years that a papacy has ended in retirement rather than death. At cnnstudentnews.com,
###265 we posted yesterday`s explainer on how the Catholic Church will choose its next leader.
###270 Next up today, a bit of bad news from the Governors Highway Safety Administration: driving
###275 death among American teenagers apparently increased in 2012. The jump was almost 20
###280 percent over the year before. Researchers aren`t sure why, but they`ve known for years
###286 that moto-vehicle accidents have been the leading cause of death for U.S. teenagers.
###290 The overall rate is still lower than it was five years ago, according to the researcher
###294 who led this study. But if the goal is to decrease the number of driving related death
###299 every year, this is a setback. Different states have different laws and limits on driving
###304 ages. Would you accept stricter teen driving laws, if it meant the possibility of fewer
###311 accidents? If you are on Facebook, tell us what you think at Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews.

###315 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Todays` "Shoutout" goes out to Ms. Colizzi`s students at Maple Valley
###322 High School in Vermontville, Michigan. What event is celebrated every year on March 8?
###328 You know what to do, is it International Women`s Day, Saint Patrick`s Day, Flag Day, or Teacher
###334 Appreciation day? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###343 it International Women`s Day has been celebrated on March 8th, for nearly a century. That`s
###348 your answer and that`s your "Shoutout".
###353 We`re still one week away from International Women`s Day, but today marks the start of
###359 women`s history month. In fact, one led to the other: International Women`s Day goes
###364 all the way back to the early 1900s. The idea came up at an International Conference of
###369 Working Women as a way to raise awareness about issues affecting women around the world.
###374 So, fast- forward to the 1970s. Women in the United States were planning a new event to
###379 celebrate the accomplishments of American women. They picked March because well, that`s
###384 when the international celebration was already taking place. Believe it or not, women`s history
###389 month didn`t start up as the whole month. At first, it was women`s history week. In
###394 1987, Congress expanded the celebration to the entire month of March. Every year, the
###399 national women`s history project picks a thing for women`s history month. This year, it`s
###404 women inspiring innovation through imagination. It`s specifically honoring women in the fields
###409 of science, technology, engineering and math. But women`s history month is designed to honor
###414 women in all walks of life. And that`s what we`ll be doing throughout March.

###420 AZUZ: Teachers, your turn? How are we doing? We`re looking for and considering all of your
###425 comments at cnnstudentnews.com. Please, swing by today, tell us what you think of this show.
###431 First known use of the word "robot" in 1920 in a play. First use of the word "robotics",
###437 1942 in a story. The actual machines are used all over the map today in science, industry,
###443 medicine, war. But up until now, anyway, they have mostly featured moving metal parts. Say
###449 hello to Saul Griffith, and what could be the next generation of robots.
###452 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###453 SAUL GRIFFITH, CO-FOUNDER, OTHERLAB: If you think about everything, all of the consumer
###457 products, every machine the humanity has ever made, it`s, you know stiff and rigid. There`s
###462 a completely grained space of soft machine. Robotics industries are most concerned with
###467 the number of degrees of freedom.
###469 SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Right.
###469 GRIFFITH: And how much it costs for each degree of freedom.
###471 Here`s a way that we could really transform the cost of robotics. We`ll eliminate all
###478 the (inaudible), we`ll eliminate the pins and the bearings and the joints. And we will
###482 sew you a robot out of fabric, and use pressurize fluids to make it work. And it will reduce
###488 the cost of robots a hundred fold, and it will make them (inaudible).
###493 The gray (ph) behind me, for example, weighs one or two pounds. Yeah, it is the size of
###497 your and fully pressurized than I couldn`t, you know, lift a human an arm`s leg.
###502 GUPTA: Wow.
###503 GRIFFITH: There`s no hinges and bearings there. It`s all done in this tensile fabric, so it`s
###508 really built like a lot of biological systems that are - this works much more like a fish
###513 or a shark than it does like a robot.

###516 AZUZ: We`ve talked recently about a couple of snowstorms that have hit several states
###520 in the U.S. Here`s some I-reports from a student in Iowa: drifts and shovels. Look at both
###527 the beauty and the work, associated with winter weather. A teacher from Texas sent us another
###533 one you probably haven`t heard about, that`s herd as in cattle, some of them got loose,
###539 possibly when snow covered over their fences, and they just mooed on down the road.
###544 And a look at the fun side of snowstorms comes from Kansas where some high school friends
###549 spend four hours building a 13 foot Franken snowman. And it`s all pretty good, but this
###555 last I-report today is the icing on the snow cone. Some students at Wale (ph) University
###561 in Texas apparently made the most of their snow day, building, shaping, slicing and sculpting
###566 a miniature at Mount Rushmore. The glasses detail are Mr. Roosevelt. Snow problem, when
###572 someone volunteered his own. It`s enough to make fans of U.S. history melt. And never
###577 did George, Thomas, Teddy and Abe look so cool. Of course, it`s neither as permanent
###582 nor as detailed as the real one. That sculpture rocks. But as long as the snow stuck around,
###586 people thought it was pretty chill. And the fact that George Washington had wooden teeth
###590 might have kept them from chattering in all that cold. That`s all for CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###594 I`m sorry, we`ve run out of time. In the future, I`ll just have to rush more. See you..
