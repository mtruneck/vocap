[MUSIC PLAYING]


9
0:0:52,77 --> 0:0:55,43
THOMAS: For those of us who
weren't there, man, the


10
0:0:55,43 --> 0:0:58,63
Vietnam War has always been
forbidden territory--


11
0:0:58,63 --> 0:1:1,78
a searing national void whose
depths and horror we can never


12
0:1:1,78 --> 0:1:5,519
know outside of grisly Fogerty
scored movies and Mark Baker's


13
0:1:5,519 --> 0:1:10,8
"Nam." Even playing Vietnam as
kids seemed off limits unless


14
0:1:10,8 --> 0:1:13,71
you did it under the
auspices of Rambo.


15
0:1:13,71 --> 0:1:17,64
To full on reenact it would be
the ultimate heresy, a slap in


16
0:1:17,64 --> 0:1:20,25
the face of all the vets who
died or were captured in the


17
0:1:20,25 --> 0:1:22,67
US military's first
defeat, right?


18
0:1:22,67 --> 0:1:25,79
But they do it in
North Carolina.


19
0:1:25,79 --> 0:1:27,5
And you know who does it?


20
0:1:27,5 --> 0:1:30,57
Other vets and a bunch of
regular reenactors.


21
0:1:30,57 --> 0:1:31,52
I think, uh.


22
0:1:31,52 --> 0:1:32,77
I think we're ready for war.


23
0:1:32,77 --> 0:1:39,478



24
0:1:39,478 --> 0:1:42,26
Over the last 50 years, war
reenactment has gone from


25
0:1:42,26 --> 0:1:44,95
something Elks lodges did on
the weekend as an excuse to


26
0:1:44,95 --> 0:1:48,38
get away from their wives, to
an obsessive pastime where


27
0:1:48,38 --> 0:1:50,66
hardcore reenactors spend
their entire free time


28
0:1:50,66 --> 0:1:53,2
shopping, sewing, and
researching to make the


29
0:1:53,2 --> 0:1:56,13
experience as true to
life as possible.


30
0:1:56,13 --> 0:1:58,69
As the intensity of the
reenactments has grown, the


31
0:1:58,69 --> 0:2:1,63
wars reenacted have raced
forward in time, from the old


32
0:2:1,63 --> 0:2:4,86
favorites of the Revolutionary
and Civil War, to World War I,


33
0:2:4,86 --> 0:2:7,475
World War II, and every
so often Korea.


34
0:2:7,475 --> 0:2:12,29



35
0:2:12,29 --> 0:2:13,703
Vietnam, however, is tricky.


36
0:2:13,703 --> 0:2:20,45



37
0:2:20,45 --> 0:2:22,57
For starters there weren't
really battles.


38
0:2:22,57 --> 0:2:25,31
Most of the fighting was done
on an ad hoc day by day and


39
0:2:25,31 --> 0:2:28,8
night by night basis.


40
0:2:28,8 --> 0:2:30,4
To solve this problem, the
reenactors we're with built a


41
0:2:30,4 --> 0:2:33,9
mock firebase out somewhere in
the shit, picked an arbitrary


42
0:2:33,9 --> 0:2:36,0
year in the war, and just
dedicated themselves to


43
0:2:36,0 --> 0:2:39,9
defending it from Viet Cong
assault all night.


44
0:2:39,9 --> 0:2:40,61
Are you still in the service?


45
0:2:40,61 --> 0:2:41,94
RUDY SCHULZ: No, I
retired in 2005.


46
0:2:41,94 --> 0:2:45,4
I was in the Army.


47
0:2:45,4 --> 0:2:48,2
I got restarted in reenacting.


48
0:2:48,2 --> 0:2:51,27
I missed the camaraderie.


49
0:2:51,27 --> 0:2:53,657
But once you get out there and
you get the feel for it, it's


50
0:2:53,657 --> 0:2:55,37
like, wow these guys
were studs.


51
0:2:55,37 --> 0:2:57,9
THOMAS: Even just a little,
little taste of it.


52
0:2:57,9 --> 0:2:58,12
RUDY SCHULZ: Just a
couple of days.


53
0:2:58,12 --> 0:3:0,76
And these guys were out there
for 40 days, 50 days in the


54
0:3:0,76 --> 0:3:1,985
snow, nothing.


55
0:3:1,985 --> 0:3:4,835
And you're like, wow it
sucked for two days.


56
0:3:4,835 --> 0:3:7,2
They had to do it for a month.


57
0:3:7,2 --> 0:3:8,705
You know, war sucks.


58
0:3:8,705 --> 0:3:11,16
It's true nobody
wants to do it.


59
0:3:11,16 --> 0:3:16,1
THOMAS: Well, except kind
of, you guys for fun.


60
0:3:16,1 --> 0:3:16,82
RUDY SCHULZ: It's true.


61
0:3:16,82 --> 0:3:17,18
THOMAS: Well, cool.


62
0:3:17,18 --> 0:3:17,81
Thank you very much.


63
0:3:17,81 --> 0:3:18,97
RUDY SCHULZ: Oh,
you're welcome.


64
0:3:18,97 --> 0:3:20,22
THOMAS: Good luck on recon.


65
0:3:20,22 --> 0:3:25,65



66
0:3:25,65 --> 0:3:27,48
Then there's the issue of
finding someone to play the


67
0:3:27,48 --> 0:3:29,7
Vietnamese.


68
0:3:29,7 --> 0:3:31,33
In our case, the reenactors just
grabbed a bunch of kids


69
0:3:31,33 --> 0:3:34,4
from the local college and
surrounding towns, which is


70
0:3:34,4 --> 0:3:36,62
kind of how Ho Chi Minh did it
when you think about it.


71
0:3:36,62 --> 0:3:43,74



72
0:3:43,74 --> 0:3:44,11
Nice.


73
0:3:44,11 --> 0:3:45,72
This isn't your first
reenactment though?


74
0:3:45,72 --> 0:3:46,76
CHRIS EVANS: I've
been reenacting


75
0:3:46,76 --> 0:3:47,92
since I was about 15.


76
0:3:47,92 --> 0:3:48,76
THOMAS: Damn.


77
0:3:48,76 --> 0:3:54,5
How did you end up as Charlie
on this little foray?


78
0:3:54,5 --> 0:3:57,97
CHRIS EVANS: Well, to put it
blank, you can't play Cowboys


79
0:3:57,97 --> 0:4:1,21
and Indians without Indians if
you understand my meaning.


80
0:4:1,21 --> 0:4:4,5
You got to have both sides to
do something like this, and


81
0:4:4,5 --> 0:4:6,83
we're just more willing
to do both sides.


82
0:4:6,83 --> 0:4:9,96



83
0:4:9,96 --> 0:4:11,58
THOMAS: So you're NVA?


84
0:4:11,58 --> 0:4:12,5
ZACK SEVER: Yes.


85
0:4:12,5 --> 0:4:12,53
THOMAS: Right.


86
0:4:12,53 --> 0:4:15,23
OK Like is there any
sort of particular


87
0:4:15,23 --> 0:4:16,49
attraction to Vietnam?


88
0:4:16,49 --> 0:4:18,81
Like does that resonate with
you in a particular way?


89
0:4:18,81 --> 0:4:19,55
ZACK SEVER: Yeah.


90
0:4:19,55 --> 0:4:22,53
My great uncle was a
First Lieutenant


91
0:4:22,53 --> 0:4:23,89
in a Calvary Division.


92
0:4:23,89 --> 0:4:24,405
THOMAS: OK.


93
0:4:24,405 --> 0:4:26,42
Does he know you're doing
this, this weekend?


94
0:4:26,42 --> 0:4:26,62
ZACK SEVER: No.


95
0:4:26,62 --> 0:4:28,33
He doesn't know I'm
doing this.


96
0:4:28,33 --> 0:4:30,98
I don't think he'd be very
happy if he did.


97
0:4:30,98 --> 0:4:33,66
THOMAS: So I'm supposed to be,
basically, a civilian reporter


98
0:4:33,66 --> 0:4:34,61
in [INAUDIBLE].


99
0:4:34,61 --> 0:4:36,46
I guess I'm kind of half-dressed
right now.


100
0:4:36,46 --> 0:4:38,8
How am I doing though, so far?


101
0:4:38,8 --> 0:4:39,58
ZACK SEVER: I mean, you're
doing pretty good.


102
0:4:39,58 --> 0:4:42,21
The reporters would be out there
in the army OD greens


103
0:4:42,21 --> 0:4:42,85
wearing helmets.


104
0:4:42,85 --> 0:4:44,74
They would have a big old PRESS
written on and around


105
0:4:44,74 --> 0:4:45,4
their helmet.


106
0:4:45,4 --> 0:4:46,41

107

from the '80s button.

118
0:5:6,1 --> 0:5:8,6
Good morning, Vietnam.


119
0:5:8,6 --> 0:5:12,286
We are outside a firebase.


120
0:5:12,286 --> 0:5:14,13
The men you see milling
behind me are


121
0:5:14,13 --> 0:5:16,64
members of the 89th Infantry.


122
0:5:16,64 --> 0:5:20,25
I don't know if the rest of this
unit has gotten up and


123
0:5:20,25 --> 0:5:20,64
gotten dressed.


124
0:5:20,64 --> 0:5:23,81
It feels like they're taking a
collegiate Saturday approach


125
0:5:23,81 --> 0:5:25,79
to this war.


126
0:5:25,79 --> 0:5:30,21
We've seen formations of VC,
irregular troops moving


127
0:5:30,21 --> 0:5:33,8
through that sort of area
towards our, I'm thinking


128
0:5:33,8 --> 0:5:36,67
that's the, north east.


129
0:5:36,67 --> 0:5:42,3
It is pouring rain which is
great for the realism but


130
0:5:42,3 --> 0:5:46,33
sucks for, I guess,
the reality.


131
0:5:46,33 --> 0:5:48,35
Perfect weather to absorb
the misery that is


132
0:5:48,35 --> 0:5:51,76
this ongoing war.

141

-This guy right here, Mooch,
he'll be the last guy.


142
0:6:8,3 --> 0:6:10,446
Give us about five yards.


143
0:6:10,446 --> 0:6:15,32
THOMAS: So five behind Mooch
is going to be our maximum.


144
0:6:15,32 --> 0:6:17,88
Since there's no predetermined
outcome, unlike traditional


145
0:6:17,88 --> 0:6:20,98
reenactments, this means America
could win the battle


146
0:6:20,98 --> 0:6:23,696
or maybe even the war.


147
0:6:23,696 --> 0:6:26,136
[GUNSHOTS]


148
0:6:26,136 --> 0:6:28,55
THOMAS: The first thing we
learned about war reenactment


149
0:6:28,55 --> 0:6:31,89
is that it's fucking terrifying
having guns fired,


150
0:6:31,89 --> 0:6:33,34
even ones loaded with blanks.


151
0:6:33,34 --> 0:6:37,3
[GUNSHOTS]


152
0:6:37,3 --> 0:6:39,21
THOMAS: The second thing
we learned was a common


153
0:6:39,21 --> 0:6:43,14
reenactor's dilemma called the
GI effect, which is basically


154
0:6:43,14 --> 0:6:46,83
that people playing Americans
don't like to die so sometimes


155
0:6:46,83 --> 0:6:48,8
they just don't.


156
0:6:48,8 --> 0:7:4,19



157
0:7:4,19 --> 0:7:6,71
DON WHITE: Most everybody out
here is an amateur military


158
0:7:6,71 --> 0:7:10,94
historian and that's the main
reason we do this hobby.


159
0:7:10,94 --> 0:7:13,46
About half of my reenacting
group are actually military


160
0:7:13,46 --> 0:7:16,81
veterans or active duty.


161
0:7:16,81 --> 0:7:19,72
SGT. WILSON: The real soldiers,
sailor, airmen,


162
0:7:19,72 --> 0:7:24,3
Marines, they all go through
horrible hardships to protect


163
0:7:24,3 --> 0:7:25,84
this country.


164
0:7:25,84 --> 0:7:28,5
We want to make sure that when
we're out here and we're doing


165
0:7:28,5 --> 0:7:31,26
these reenactments, that
we're not doing a


166
0:7:31,26 --> 0:7:34,13
disservice to them.


167
0:7:34,13 --> 0:7:35,84
THOMAS: The realism of the
combat makes it even more


168
0:7:35,84 --> 0:7:38,563
psychologically intriguing
that ex-combatants would


169
0:7:38,563 --> 0:7:40,84
submit themselves to this
guaranteed flashback trigger.


170
0:7:40,84 --> 0:7:45,14



171
0:7:45,14 --> 0:7:47,23
Does anybody ever have
any problems with it?


172
0:7:47,23 --> 0:7:49,87
Like having come from combat
basically going


173
0:7:49,87 --> 0:7:51,12
into simulated combat?


174
0:7:51,12 --> 0:7:53,6



175
0:7:53,6 --> 0:7:55,16
DON WHITE: We have some
guys once in a while


176
0:7:55,16 --> 0:7:58,38
that have some problems.


177
0:7:58,38 --> 0:7:59,98
I'd say it's about
40% of them.


178
0:7:59,98 --> 0:8:2,83
Their first event back they'll
actually go sit in the camp


179
0:8:2,83 --> 0:8:6,77
for that event or have some
issues with the--


180
0:8:6,77 --> 0:8:9,32
THOMAS: Yeah, it'll take them
time to acclimate to that.


181
0:8:9,32 --> 0:8:15,32



182
0:8:15,32 --> 0:8:17,54
SGT. WILSON: The horror and the
terror is just shards of a


183
0:8:17,54 --> 0:8:20,37
veteran's experience
in the military.


184
0:8:20,37 --> 0:8:23,27
And if we can focus on the
positive aspects as well as


185
0:8:23,27 --> 0:8:26,885
the hardships, the veterans,
they really appreciate that


186
0:8:26,885 --> 0:8:28,135
and they really like that.


187
0:8:28,135 --> 0:8:31,84



188
0:8:31,84 --> 0:8:34,7
THOMAS: We've been asked along,
actually, by this recon


189
0:8:34,7 --> 0:8:37,49
unit made up of Special Forces
guys that are going back out


190
0:8:37,49 --> 0:8:40,86
into the woods trying to flush
out the dudes who are lighting


191
0:8:40,86 --> 0:8:42,11
up the firebase.

0:9:8,865 --> 0:9:9,51
-All right then.

Let me go.

Let me grab a quick

205
0:9:16,56 --> 0:9:18,71

war you don't very often get


206
0:9:18,71 --> 0:9:20,0
to see, and that's--


207
0:9:20,0 --> 0:9:23,37



208
0:9:23,37 --> 0:9:24,0
Oh, no, no.

0:9:25,25 --> 0:9:31,51



211
0:9:31,51 --> 0:9:31,76
Right.


212
0:9:31,76 --> 0:9:32,1
No, no, no.


213
0:9:32,1 --> 0:9:33,23
We understand that.


214
0:9:33,23 --> 0:9:35,21
You obviously get breaks
and things.


215
0:9:35,21 --> 0:9:39,55
We'll head back and hopefully
not see you again.


216
0:9:39,55 --> 0:9:40,94
CHRIS EVANS: You'll see
us again as soon as we


217
0:9:40,94 --> 0:9:42,0
get our guys back.


218
0:9:42,0 --> 0:9:49,13
THOMAS: All right As night fell,
we snuck away from the


219
0:9:49,13 --> 0:9:52,17
American unit we were embedded
with and fell in with a bunch


220
0:9:52,17 --> 0:9:55,35
of VC and NVA regulars who were
planning a nocturnal raid


221
0:9:55,35 --> 0:9:57,76
on the firebase.


222
0:9:57,76 --> 0:9:59,61
-When we were young, we'd do
like little pranks, right?


223
0:9:59,61 --> 0:10:2,595
So we'd phone up a Chinese
restaurant, we go, do you have


224
0:10:2,595 --> 0:10:4,41
one young guy?


225
0:10:4,41 --> 0:10:6,33
And literally this guy
said, he looks,


226
0:10:6,33 --> 0:10:7,1
I'll look in the menu.


227
0:10:7,1 --> 0:10:7,66
He looks in the menu.


228
0:10:7,66 --> 0:10:9,45
He goes, no, we don't
have one young guy.


229
0:10:9,45 --> 0:10:11,52
And I said, well, do you
have an old one then?


230
0:10:11,52 --> 0:10:13,922
And hang up the phone.


231
0:10:13,922 --> 0:10:14,794
-One young guy?


232
0:10:14,794 --> 0:10:16,646
-One young guy.


233
0:10:16,646 --> 0:10:20,7
-Oh, jeez.


234
0:10:20,7 --> 0:10:22,91
THOMAS: Just a bunch of VC
hanging out in a tobacco


235
0:10:22,91 --> 0:10:25,46
field, teaching each other
how [INAUDIBLE].


236
0:10:25,46 --> 0:10:26,74
I mean, it's not a rice
paddy but whatever,


237
0:10:26,74 --> 0:10:28,15
you're in North Carolina.


238
0:10:28,15 --> 0:10:28,735
-This is your team.


239
0:10:28,735 --> 0:10:32,49
Anybody with a red scarf,
you're NVA.


240
0:10:32,49 --> 0:10:34,54
If you get killed, stay there.


241
0:10:34,54 --> 0:10:36,655
The Americans are going to check
you, search you, then


242
0:10:36,655 --> 0:10:38,45
they're going to
leave you, OK?


243
0:10:38,45 --> 0:10:40,3
After they check you.


244
0:10:40,3 --> 0:10:41,28
Girls--


245
0:10:41,28 --> 0:10:43,32
they know that you all are
girls, don't worry about it.


246
0:10:43,32 --> 0:10:46,477



247
0:10:46,477 --> 0:10:47,727
THOMAS: It begins.


248
0:10:47,727 --> 0:10:52,27



249
0:10:52,27 --> 0:10:53,749
-Come on you fucking gook.


250
0:10:53,749 --> 0:10:56,72



251
0:10:56,72 --> 0:10:59,238
THOMAS: Charlie's fucking
everywhere.


252
0:10:59,238 --> 0:11:2,521
Our firebase is under attack.


253
0:11:2,521 --> 0:11:5,605
-Cut the camera off.


254
0:11:5,605 --> 0:11:7,425
[GUNSHOTS]


255
0:11:7,425 --> 0:11:8,79
-Next.


256
0:11:8,79 --> 0:11:10,59
THOMAS: So we just witnessed
a war crime.


257
0:11:10,59 --> 0:13:10,59
