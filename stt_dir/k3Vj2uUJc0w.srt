1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,48
- Your faces had sex with each other.
- I had sex last night.


2
0:0:3,48 --> 0:0:6,579
So long as you live under
my roof, you live by my rules.


3
0:0:6,579 --> 0:0:9,176
He kissed me! So he must like me.


4
0:0:9,176 --> 0:0:11,32
I've just seen Archie.
He ain't coming.


5
0:0:11,32 --> 0:0:12,681
Just leave me alone.


6
0:0:12,681 --> 0:0:15,778
I knew you couldn't
possibly like me!


7
0:0:15,778 --> 0:0:18,99
I think he's a dick for what he did.


8
0:0:18,99 --> 0:0:36,617
Wow!


9
0:0:36,617 --> 0:0:39,308
'When you've lived in
someone's shadow for a long time,


10
0:0:39,308 --> 0:0:40,949
'you kind of get used to it.'


11
0:0:40,949 --> 0:0:42,768
Come on, Rae!


12
0:0:42,768 --> 0:0:44,488
'You have to...


13
0:0:44,488 --> 0:0:47,547
'especially when
it's someone so perfect


14
0:0:47,547 --> 0:0:49,627
'and so beautiful.


15
0:0:49,627 --> 0:0:53,307
'You accept that some birds
are high-flying birds...


16
0:0:53,307 --> 0:0:55,507
'and other birds are not.


17
0:0:55,507 --> 0:1:11,873
'But that doesn't mean
they can't fly together.'


18
0:1:11,873 --> 0:1:14,48
Oh, he got it that time, didn't he?


19
0:1:14,48 --> 0:1:17,961
Being back at school on the summer
holidays is just wrong, innit?


20
0:1:17,961 --> 0:1:21,126
Yeah, but we need to
support Chlo, don't we?


21
0:1:21,126 --> 0:1:22,486
Come on, Chlo!


22
0:1:22,486 --> 0:1:23,721
- Whoo!
- Come on, Chlo!


23
0:1:23,721 --> 0:1:24,664
You can do it!


24
0:1:24,664 --> 0:1:25,736
Come on, girl! Yeah!


25
0:1:25,736 --> 0:1:28,295
I'm telling you, it's him,
it's Michael Price.


26
0:1:28,295 --> 0:1:32,576
He is nowhere near good-looking
enough to be going out with Chloe.


27
0:1:32,576 --> 0:1:34,655
I mean, look at the state
of her. She's well hot.


28
0:1:34,655 --> 0:1:36,695
Rae, you're supposed
to be Chloe's best mate.


29
0:1:36,695 --> 0:1:39,17
How do you not know
who she's sleeping with?


30
0:1:39,17 --> 0:1:40,576
Whoo! Come on, Chloe!


31
0:1:40,576 --> 0:1:41,177
Come on, Chlo!


32
0:1:41,177 --> 0:1:42,296
Come on, Chlo!


33
0:1:42,296 --> 0:1:44,348
You can do it!


34
0:1:44,348 --> 0:1:47,628
'All eyes on
the lovely Chloe as usual.


35
0:1:47,628 --> 0:1:50,228
'What I wasn't telling them


36
0:1:50,228 --> 0:1:53,514
'was that my secret
boyfriend was there as well.


37
0:1:53,514 --> 0:1:55,114
'Mr Carrisford,


38
0:1:55,114 --> 0:2:2,634
'our PE teacher/gold medal
sex athlete at the Rae Olympics.


39
0:2:2,634 --> 0:2:7,354
'We had met every day
for the last two weeks...


40
0:2:7,354 --> 0:2:9,874
'..in my mind.'


41
0:2:9,874 --> 0:2:11,994
Rae.


42
0:2:11,994 --> 0:2:14,234
I didn't think you'd...


43
0:2:14,234 --> 0:2:21,594
come.


44
0:2:21,594 --> 0:2:23,954
What's with all the Caramacs?


45
0:2:23,954 --> 0:2:25,154
Shh!


46
0:2:25,154 --> 0:2:38,234
You shut your pretty mouth
and start opening them.


47
0:2:38,234 --> 0:2:41,994
'Finn had a point -
why hadn't Chloe told me?


48
0:2:41,994 --> 0:2:44,755
'We were supposed to be
best friends again.


49
0:2:44,755 --> 0:2:49,754
'We were supposed to
tell each other everything.


50
0:2:49,754 --> 0:2:54,834
'The only possible explanation was
that she'd made the whole thing up.


51
0:2:54,834 --> 0:2:56,593
'That actually, in real life,


52
0:2:56,593 --> 0:3:0,874
'she stayed up all night
fantasising like the rest of us.'


53
0:3:0,874 --> 0:3:18,67
Oh, hi, Mr Carrisford.

Are you still here?

0:3:58,573 --> 0:4:1,474
'Why can't I get noticed
by boys in real life,


57
0:4:1,474 --> 0:4:5,594

men from my wildest fantasies?

0:4:5,594 --> 0:4:10,594
'Worst summer holiday ever.'


59
0:4:10,594 --> 0:4:14,193
Raemundo! This is Little Al.
You know Barney and Lizard.


60
0:4:14,193 --> 0:4:17,115
Listen, I want to
chat to you about Saturday.


61
0:4:17,115 --> 0:4:18,394
What's Saturday?


62
0:4:18,394 --> 0:4:19,834
Oasis. Knebworth.


63
0:4:19,834 --> 0:4:21,954
I don't want to talk about it.


64
0:4:21,954 --> 0:4:22,835
The lads got tickets!


65
0:4:22,835 --> 0:4:24,194
What?


66
0:4:24,194 --> 0:4:25,434
Lucky bastards!


67
0:4:25,434 --> 0:4:29,274
You mean...
you're all actually going?


68
0:4:29,274 --> 0:4:30,915
We didn't know what to say.


69
0:4:30,915 --> 0:4:32,434
Sorry.


70
0:4:32,434 --> 0:4:34,714
Well, it's...


71
0:4:34,714 --> 0:4:36,75
not that big a deal.


72
0:4:36,75 --> 0:4:39,74
So... you don't want this, then?


73
0:4:39,74 --> 0:4:41,674
I've got one spare.


74
0:4:41,674 --> 0:4:42,875
Are you messing with me?


75
0:4:42,875 --> 0:4:46,114
I'm not messing with you.


76
0:4:46,114 --> 0:4:46,915
Don't mess with me.


77
0:4:46,915 --> 0:4:50,954
I'm not! It's real.


78
0:4:50,954 --> 0:5:7,434
Oh, Chop!


79
0:5:7,434 --> 0:5:12,354
Oh, this is the best
summer holiday ever. Archie!


80
0:5:12,354 --> 0:5:13,914
Yes.


81
0:5:13,914 --> 0:5:14,554
Chop!


82
0:5:14,554 --> 0:5:15,634
My dear!


83
0:5:15,634 --> 0:5:20,434
Oh, yeah!


84
0:5:20,434 --> 0:5:22,754
You excited about Knebworth, then?


85
0:5:22,754 --> 0:5:24,954
Suppose so.


86
0:5:24,954 --> 0:5:27,474
'How can I have ever fantasised


87
0:5:27,474 --> 0:5:31,314
'about sleeping with
someone so utterly annoying?


88
0:5:31,314 --> 0:5:33,114
'Yeah, he was stunning...


89
0:5:33,114 --> 0:5:38,34
'With an arse that I just wanted
to bite into like a violent dog,

'but he was so big-headed,
so miserable, so self...'


91
0:5:41,235 --> 0:5:43,874
Stop staring at me.
It freaks me out.


92
0:5:43,874 --> 0:5:45,754
I'm not staring at you.


93
0:5:45,754 --> 0:5:48,914
Right, whatever.


94
0:5:48,914 --> 0:5:50,994
So, Mr Choppy Chop...


95
0:5:50,994 --> 0:5:51,714
Hello.


96
0:5:51,714 --> 0:5:54,393
Why I am going
and not Chloe or Izzy?


97
0:5:54,393 --> 0:5:56,713
Didn't ask them.
You was first choice.


98
0:5:56,713 --> 0:5:58,553
Well, it's kind of
a lads' trip only.


99
0:5:58,553 --> 0:6:0,193
But we see you as
one of the lads anyway,


100
0:6:0,193 --> 0:6:2,553
so obviously we knew you
weren't going to be a problem.


101
0:6:2,553 --> 0:6:4,553
Do you know what I mean?
So we just carried on.


102
0:6:4,553 --> 0:6:7,313
'But we
see you as one of the lads anyway.


103
0:6:7,313 --> 0:6:9,193
'But we see you as
one of the lads anyway.


104
0:6:9,193 --> 0:6:12,75
'But we see you as
one of the lads anyway...'


105
0:6:12,75 --> 0:6:27,754
'But we see you as
one of the lads anyway...'


106
0:6:27,754 --> 0:6:33,194
Rae, we need to talk.


107
0:6:33,194 --> 0:6:35,715
You know I wanted to
talk to you earlier, but...


108
0:6:35,715 --> 0:6:41,954
well, you've been busy with
the boys all evening, so...


109
0:6:41,954 --> 0:6:44,714
Are you going to tell anyone, Rae?


110
0:6:44,714 --> 0:6:47,274
Why would I tell anyone?


111
0:6:47,274 --> 0:6:48,794
Don't know.


112
0:6:48,794 --> 0:6:52,674
Chloe, what are you thinking?!


113
0:6:52,674 --> 0:6:54,795
He's a teacher. It's just wrong.


114
0:6:54,795 --> 0:6:58,74
How can you say that?


115
0:6:58,74 --> 0:7:1,593
You know, the other day, you said,
"I'll sex him into a coma so deep


116
0:7:1,593 --> 0:7:3,993
"the only way he'd wake up
was if I sexed him some more."


117
0:7:3,993 --> 0:7:6,995
Yeah, but that doesn't mean I'd
actually do anything in real life.


118
0:7:6,995 --> 0:7:8,874
Oh, right. OK, then.


119
0:7:8,874 --> 0:7:12,594
Chloe, he's clearly
taking advantage of you.


120
0:7:12,594 --> 0:7:16,354
No! You know nothing about us.


121
0:7:16,354 --> 0:7:18,594
You know, cos...


122
0:7:18,594 --> 0:7:20,75
well, we trust each other.


123
0:7:20,75 --> 0:7:21,514
Yeah, right.


124
0:7:21,514 --> 0:7:23,634
Oh, I'm sorry, Rae, I forgot...


125
0:7:23,634 --> 0:7:25,833
cos you're the expert
on love, aren't ya?


126
0:7:25,833 --> 0:7:28,33
Cos how many boys is it
you've kissed again?


127
0:7:28,33 --> 0:7:29,713
I'd rather have only kissed one boy


128
0:7:29,713 --> 0:7:32,115
than give
mouth-to-south resuscitation


129
0:7:32,115 --> 0:7:33,834
to someone twice my age


130
0:7:33,834 --> 0:7:37,233
in a Vauxhall Nova on a bit
of scrubland behind a SPAR.


131
0:7:37,233 --> 0:7:42,474
Don't make me feel bad just cos I've
got a boyfriend and you haven't.


132
0:7:42,474 --> 0:7:47,874
Do you know, you're always making me
feel guilty for having things.


133
0:7:47,874 --> 0:7:51,633
You think I've got it so easy,
Rae, and you've got no idea


134
0:7:51,633 --> 0:7:53,753
what it's like to have
to walk into a room


135
0:7:53,753 --> 0:7:55,435
and have everyone look at you.


136
0:7:55,435 --> 0:7:57,194
All of the time.


137
0:7:57,194 --> 0:8:0,194
I do know what it feels like...


138
0:8:0,194 --> 0:8:5,994
to walk into a room and
have everybody stare at me.


139
0:8:5,994 --> 0:8:12,234
Do you know that every time
we talk to boys...


140
0:8:12,234 --> 0:8:15,515
they're not talking to us,
they're talking to you?


141
0:8:15,515 --> 0:8:16,914
Whatever, Rae!


142
0:8:16,914 --> 0:8:19,434
Oh, no.


143
0:8:19,434 --> 0:8:23,354
Of course you don't, Princess Chloe.


144
0:8:23,354 --> 0:8:26,874
So don't you dare
sit there and tell me


145
0:8:26,874 --> 0:8:31,514
how difficult you've got it.


146
0:8:31,514 --> 0:8:32,874
You're just a...


147
0:8:32,874 --> 0:8:37,274
I'm a what?


148
0:8:37,274 --> 0:8:38,994
Nothing.


149
0:8:38,994 --> 0:8:41,674
Go on.


150
0:8:41,674 --> 0:8:50,154
Say it.


151
0:8:50,154 --> 0:8:58,714
Chloe, you're a really shit friend.


152
0:8:58,714 --> 0:9:8,914
Sometimes.


153
0:9:8,914 --> 0:9:11,835
Well, if that's the way
you feel, maybe...


154
0:9:11,835 --> 0:9:19,994
we shouldn't be friends.


155
0:9:19,994 --> 0:9:21,434
Fine.


156
0:9:21,434 --> 0:9:23,274
Coo-ee!


157
0:9:23,274 --> 0:9:26,314
Found you, sneaky sneakies!


158
0:9:26,314 --> 0:9:30,914
We're moving on to The Basement.
Get a wriggle on.


159
0:9:30,914 --> 0:9:34,994
Rae's not coming.


160
0:9:34,994 --> 0:9:45,914
She doesn't feel well.


161
0:9:45,914 --> 0:10:2,991
You all right?


162
0:10:2,991 --> 0:10:6,16
You're gonna say that I'm angry
because I'm jealous.


163
0:10:6,16 --> 0:10:8,37
Well, yeah, I am jealous.


164
0:10:8,37 --> 0:10:10,477
I'm jealous because she's pretty.


165
0:10:10,477 --> 0:10:12,636
I'm jealous because she's good
at things.


166
0:10:12,636 --> 0:10:15,916
I'm jealous because she's slight
but curvy. Clever. Sporty.


167
0:10:15,916 --> 0:10:18,572
I'm jealous
because she's Grade 4 on the cello,


168
0:10:18,572 --> 0:10:21,571
because she volunteers
at an outreach centre.


169
0:10:21,571 --> 0:10:23,731
I'm jealous
because she's the type of girl


170
0:10:23,731 --> 0:10:26,83
who will one day appear on the cover
of Marie Claire


171
0:10:26,83 --> 0:10:28,35
sunbathing on a yacht.


172
0:10:28,35 --> 0:10:31,782
I'm jealous
just because of the way she is.


173
0:10:31,782 --> 0:10:33,182
Because she...


174
0:10:33,182 --> 0:10:35,302
well, she...


175
0:10:35,302 --> 0:10:37,742
she is like...


176
0:10:37,742 --> 0:10:42,22
a girl.


177
0:10:42,22 --> 0:10:43,581
Why are you friends with Chloe?


178
0:10:43,581 --> 0:10:46,821
Because we've always been friends.
That's the reason.


179
0:10:46,821 --> 0:10:48,941
You have those friends,
and you think,


180
0:10:48,941 --> 0:10:52,261
well... if I met you now...
well, I wouldn't even talk to you.


181
0:10:52,261 --> 0:10:54,703
But because we've known each other
for such a long time,


182
0:10:54,703 --> 0:10:59,182
because we've got a history...


183
0:10:59,182 --> 0:11:1,783
I've always been in her shadow
and I'm just...


184
0:11:1,783 --> 0:11:4,702
I'm sick of it now.


185
0:11:4,702 --> 0:11:9,182
But why now? I mean, what's changed?


186
0:11:9,182 --> 0:11:11,701
All those qualities
that you see in Chloe...


187
0:11:11,701 --> 0:11:13,701
you don't see any of those in
yourself?


188
0:11:13,701 --> 0:11:15,463
Well, I'm definitely not girly.


189
0:11:15,463 --> 0:11:17,302
Why do you say that?


190
0:11:17,302 --> 0:11:19,742
My nickname is Raemundo.


191
0:11:19,742 --> 0:11:21,862
I drink pints. I swear.


192
0:11:21,862 --> 0:11:23,782
I'm loud. I tell jokes.


193
0:11:23,782 --> 0:11:26,542
What's not girly about telling
jokes?


194
0:11:26,542 --> 0:11:30,22
Oh, because telling jokes is a boy
thing.


195
0:11:30,22 --> 0:11:32,661
And boys don't like it
when girls tell jokes,


196
0:11:32,661 --> 0:11:34,741
because it freaks them out
to think that a girl


197
0:11:34,741 --> 0:11:37,463
might actually be funnier
than what they are.


198
0:11:37,463 --> 0:11:39,262
Oh!


199
0:11:39,262 --> 0:11:43,822
So it's actually... about boys?


200
0:11:43,822 --> 0:11:50,342
Boys decide whether
you are girly or not?


201
0:11:50,342 --> 0:11:55,302
I find you intensely irritating
some days.


202
0:11:55,302 --> 0:11:57,782
It's what I live for.


203
0:11:57,782 --> 0:12:1,383
Maybe your relationship has changed,
at least in part,


204
0:12:1,383 --> 0:12:4,902
because your relationship with men
has changed.


205
0:12:4,902 --> 0:12:7,21
And because you're part
of a group now,


206
0:12:7,21 --> 0:12:9,781
maybe you and Chloe are just trying
to figure out, you know,


207
0:12:9,781 --> 0:12:12,501
how your friendship works
now that things are different.


208
0:12:12,501 --> 0:12:14,423
Well, how do I figure that out?


209
0:12:14,423 --> 0:12:17,622
Well, you need to think, um...


210
0:12:17,622 --> 0:12:19,181
is there more to this relationship


211
0:12:19,181 --> 0:12:21,301
than having known each other
for ages?


212
0:12:21,301 --> 0:12:25,223
You need to think how you'd feel if
Chloe was no longer in your life.


213
0:12:25,223 --> 0:12:28,982
Would you miss her?
I doubt it.


214
0:12:28,982 --> 0:12:33,542
You honestly don't think
you'd miss her?


215
0:12:33,542 --> 0:12:35,822
Come on, Rae...


216
0:12:35,822 --> 0:12:38,222
we're making progress here.


217
0:12:38,222 --> 0:12:39,943
Engage with me.
It's not that.


218
0:12:39,943 --> 0:12:43,302
What? Then what is it?


219
0:12:43,302 --> 0:12:45,222
I think I'm having a period.


220
0:12:45,222 --> 0:12:47,182
Tuesday, 16th August.


221
0:12:47,182 --> 0:12:49,22
Well done, that day!


222
0:12:49,22 --> 0:12:51,23
The first sign of womanhood
for 18 months.


223
0:12:51,23 --> 0:12:53,582
I must have lost weight.


224
0:12:53,582 --> 0:12:57,182
My GP said that's probably
why they stopped.


225
0:12:57,182 --> 0:13:0,263
I'm so pleased for you, Rae.
What does it feel like?


226
0:13:0,263 --> 0:13:4,702
It feels like a tiny little bastard
is punching me


227
0:13:4,702 --> 0:13:7,942
in the small of my back.


228
0:13:7,942 --> 0:13:9,502
Aw...


229
0:13:9,502 --> 0:13:11,902
Sandra the sanitary towel.


230
0:13:11,902 --> 0:13:15,382
It's finally time for her
to fulfil her destiny.


231
0:13:15,382 --> 0:13:18,862
I'm actually a woman, Tix -
this proves it.


232
0:13:18,862 --> 0:13:23,182
Now all I have to do is prove it
to the boys at Knebworth.


233
0:13:23,182 --> 0:13:25,342
I need to look hot.


234
0:13:25,342 --> 0:13:27,822
Why don't you just buy a dress?


235
0:13:27,822 --> 0:13:30,743
I think, as a boy, that's what
we think of as being pretty girly.


236
0:13:30,743 --> 0:13:32,102
Danny?!


237
0:13:32,102 --> 0:13:33,142
Yo.


238
0:13:33,142 --> 0:13:35,61
What the hell are you doing in here?!


239
0:13:35,61 --> 0:13:36,821
The men's was out of order.


240
0:13:36,821 --> 0:13:38,621
Look, it doesn't even have to be
a dress -


241
0:13:38,621 --> 0:13:40,981
it could be like something
a bit more... fashiony, you know?


242
0:13:40,981 --> 0:13:42,821
Something a bit like a...
Danny, get out!


243
0:13:42,821 --> 0:13:44,703
Yeah... out! Hurry up and get out.


244
0:13:44,703 --> 0:13:51,342
I'm going.
It's the ladies!


245
0:13:51,342 --> 0:14:37,262
Why didn't we think of that?


246
0:14:37,262 --> 0:14:57,262
Nice!


247
0:14:57,262 --> 0:15:0,782
The key to getting anything off my
mum was timing.


248
0:15:0,782 --> 0:15:3,823
Ask her for anything
when she's in a good mood


249
0:15:3,823 --> 0:15:6,62
and you're guaranteed success.


250
0:15:6,62 --> 0:15:11,942
Things weren't looking good.


251
0:15:11,942 --> 0:15:13,702
New regime?


252
0:15:13,702 --> 0:15:16,262
Russian Peasant diet.


253
0:15:16,262 --> 0:15:20,702
Only fucking liquids
for the next four days.


254
0:15:20,702 --> 0:15:23,343
I'm eating a bowl of vegetable stock
for my dinner.


255
0:15:23,343 --> 0:15:24,902
Mmm...


256
0:15:24,902 --> 0:15:28,782
Smells good.


257
0:15:28,782 --> 0:15:30,422
I was thinking


258
0:15:30,422 --> 0:15:32,502
that it might be nice


259
0:15:32,502 --> 0:15:34,21
if I got some new clothes.
How much?


260
0:15:34,21 --> 0:15:37,383
Well, there's this company that do,
like, tailor-made stuff...


261
0:15:37,383 --> 0:15:40,382
How much?


262
0:15:40,382 --> 0:15:41,782
95 quid.


263
0:15:41,782 --> 0:15:43,23
You think I was born yesterday


264
0:15:43,23 --> 0:15:48,222
floating down the river
on a banana boat? No chance.


265
0:15:48,222 --> 0:15:51,821
I can't find anything that fits me
in a normal shop!


266
0:15:51,821 --> 0:15:53,983
Why don't you borrow
something of mine?


267
0:15:53,983 --> 0:16:0,262
Because I'd rather die.


268
0:16:0,262 --> 0:16:2,62
This isn't fair!


269
0:16:2,62 --> 0:16:4,621
Everyone else gets money
off their parents!


270
0:16:4,621 --> 0:16:9,462
But no, I've got to live in a house
that doesn't even stock tampons!


271
0:16:9,462 --> 0:16:11,62
Do you know what, Mum?


272
0:16:11,62 --> 0:16:15,342
Value sanitary towels are a crime
against my femininity.


273
0:16:15,342 --> 0:16:18,422
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Ms Pankhurst,


274
0:16:18,422 --> 0:16:20,621
next time I go to the supermarket,


275
0:16:20,621 --> 0:16:24,341
I'll buy you a bag of swans' necks
and you can use those.


276
0:16:24,341 --> 0:16:27,223
Besides, you only started your
period again today, so, you know,


277
0:16:27,223 --> 0:16:55,142
let's not pretend we're experts.


278
0:16:55,142 --> 0:17:0,622
All right!


279
0:17:0,622 --> 0:17:3,582
Fucking typical!


280
0:17:3,582 --> 0:17:15,62
Well, can I come in?


281
0:17:15,62 --> 0:17:17,663
So how was The Basement
the other night?


282
0:17:17,663 --> 0:17:21,342
It was all right.


283
0:17:21,342 --> 0:17:27,182
Look, this is some of the stuff
that you left at mine.


284
0:17:27,182 --> 0:17:32,822
I thought I'd bring it round
for you.


285
0:17:32,822 --> 0:17:36,423
Rae, there's something else
I need to talk to you about.


286
0:17:36,423 --> 0:17:40,742
Well, I didn't know
where else to go, because...


287
0:17:40,742 --> 0:17:42,583
you're the only one
who knows about Stephen.


288
0:17:42,583 --> 0:17:44,302
Who's the fuck's Stephen?


289
0:17:44,302 --> 0:17:46,222
Mr Carrisford!


290
0:17:46,222 --> 0:17:48,982
Oh...


291
0:17:48,982 --> 0:17:50,702
Right.


292
0:17:50,702 --> 0:17:53,422
So has he broken up with you, then?


293
0:17:53,422 --> 0:17:55,782
He was just a boyfriend.


294
0:17:55,782 --> 0:17:58,23
I think it's probably for the best,


295
0:17:58,23 --> 0:18:2,222
because it wasn't right...
you and him...


296
0:18:2,222 --> 0:18:4,222
going out with each other.


297
0:18:4,222 --> 0:18:11,982
Yeah, well, he hasn't broken up
with me!


298
0:18:11,982 --> 0:18:18,822
I'm pregnant!


299
0:18:18,822 --> 0:18:23,622
Fucking hell.


300
0:18:23,622 --> 0:18:25,342
Well...


301
0:18:25,342 --> 0:18:27,142
say something, Rae!


302
0:18:27,142 --> 0:18:29,22
Fucking hell!


303
0:18:29,22 --> 0:18:30,903
I thought you were on the pill!


304
0:18:30,903 --> 0:18:33,102
Yeah, well, I stopped taking it.


305
0:18:33,102 --> 0:18:36,582
Why?


306
0:18:36,582 --> 0:18:39,501
The packet said
it could make you put on weight.


307
0:18:39,501 --> 0:18:42,421
So rather than just put on
a little bit of weight,


308
0:18:42,421 --> 0:18:45,901
you thought that you would risk
getting knocked up?!


309
0:18:45,901 --> 0:18:48,423
Yeah, do you know,
that's exactly what I thought!


310
0:18:48,423 --> 0:18:50,782
Uh...! You know what, Chloe?


311
0:18:50,782 --> 0:18:54,101
Most pregnant women,
well, they put on at least...


312
0:18:54,101 --> 0:18:55,141
one, two, three...


313
0:18:55,141 --> 0:18:56,901
Yeah, I get the irony of it, Rae!


314
0:18:56,901 --> 0:18:59,183
Rae, if you want your jeans washing
inside out,


315
0:18:59,183 --> 0:19:5,982
put them in the basket
in... side... out!


316
0:19:5,982 --> 0:19:9,702
So what are you gonna do about it,
then?


317
0:19:9,702 --> 0:19:11,862
Are you gonna tell Mr Car...


318
0:19:11,862 --> 0:19:13,102
Stephen?


319
0:19:13,102 --> 0:19:15,502
No.


320
0:19:15,502 --> 0:19:16,783
It would ruin everything.


321
0:19:16,783 --> 0:19:18,262
I think you should.


322
0:19:18,262 --> 0:19:20,581
Yeah, well,
you don't know him, Rae.


323
0:19:20,581 --> 0:19:22,466
You're the one that said
you trust each other.


324
0:19:22,466 --> 0:19:24,102
Don't have a go at me!


325
0:19:24,102 --> 0:19:29,462
I'm not having a go at you.


326
0:19:29,462 --> 0:19:33,542
Do you know, my mum...


327
0:19:33,542 --> 0:19:39,22
I remember she told me ages ago
she got pregnant when she was young.


328
0:19:39,22 --> 0:19:42,422
She said it stays with you.


329
0:19:42,422 --> 0:19:44,103
Whether you have it or not.


330
0:19:44,103 --> 0:19:48,422
You know, whatever decision you
make, it's for ever.


331
0:19:48,422 --> 0:19:59,982
She'd be so disappointed
if she knew about this.


332
0:19:59,982 --> 0:20:6,582
I've got an appointment at
the clinic on Thursday.


333
0:20:6,582 --> 0:20:9,23
Will you come with me?
You don't have to.


334
0:20:9,23 --> 0:20:9,862
It's fine.


335
0:20:9,862 --> 0:20:12,422
Chloe...


336
0:20:12,422 --> 0:20:15,942
I'll come with you.


337
0:20:15,942 --> 0:20:23,702
OK.


338
0:20:23,702 --> 0:20:28,702
I'll see you later.


339
0:20:28,702 --> 0:20:30,102
It's bad.


340
0:20:30,102 --> 0:20:32,382
OK, it's really bad,


341
0:20:32,382 --> 0:20:36,142
but this was typical of Chloe!
I have my first kiss,


342
0:20:36,142 --> 0:20:37,822
she loses her virginity.


343
0:20:37,822 --> 0:20:39,622
I get my period back,


344
0:20:39,622 --> 0:20:41,142
and she gets pregnant!


345
0:20:41,142 --> 0:20:42,941
If I went to Butlin's on holiday,


346
0:20:42,941 --> 0:20:45,183
she'd probably go to Disneyland...


347
0:20:45,183 --> 0:20:47,302
on the bloody moon.


348
0:20:47,302 --> 0:20:52,302
I hate myself for thinking that.


349
0:20:52,302 --> 0:20:54,662
God...


350
0:20:54,662 --> 0:20:56,622
Please... please... please...


351
0:20:56,622 --> 0:20:58,62
Oh, God.
Oh, Jabba!


352
0:20:58,62 --> 0:20:59,262
Oh, fuck!


353
0:20:59,262 --> 0:21:0,302
Jabba!


354
0:21:0,302 --> 0:21:1,623
'The Green Lane Gang.


355

Are you all right?


368
0:22:37,405 --> 0:22:39,45
Yeah. Why?


369
0:22:39,45 --> 0:22:42,206
Me and Karim barely saw you
yesterday, did we?


370
0:22:42,206 --> 0:22:44,485
Mmm.
What's going on?


371
0:22:44,485 --> 0:22:45,738
Nothing.


372

'..And reassess how they're going to
try and plot a way


373

'back into this match.'


374
0:22:50,778 --> 0:22:52,738
Should I ring Kester?


375
0:22:52,738 --> 0:23:5,612
What? No! I'm fine.


376
0:23:5,612 --> 0:23:6,892
Mum...


377
0:23:6,892 --> 0:23:10,172
is there such thing as a mega period?


378
0:23:10,172 --> 0:23:11,932
Mega?


379
0:23:11,932 --> 0:23:15,252
Well, maybe you should go
and see Dr Nick?


380
0:23:15,252 --> 0:23:18,533
You can't just nip in and see
Dr Nick. He's not a normal GP.


381
0:23:18,533 --> 0:23:21,892
Why not? He's been your doctor for
four months.


382
0:23:21,892 --> 0:23:23,531
Sorting out your pills and your
diet.


383
0:23:23,531 --> 0:23:24,834
Why can't you talk to him
about this?


384
0:23:24,834 --> 0:23:26,834
Because no, all right?


385
0:23:26,834 --> 0:23:28,673
Oh, I'll just get his number
from the phone book.


386
0:23:28,673 --> 0:23:33,474
There is no way I'm talking to
Dr Nick about my mega period!


387
0:23:33,474 --> 0:23:37,416
'Just another chapter of humiliation
in the multi-volumed anthology


388
0:23:37,416 --> 0:23:41,456
'of Rae the Ridiculous.


389
0:23:41,456 --> 0:23:42,962
'Oh, God...


390
0:23:42,962 --> 0:23:44,482
'he's gorgeous.


391
0:23:44,482 --> 0:23:47,921
'Maybe if I hit him over the head
with that paperweight,


392
0:23:47,921 --> 0:23:53,682
'I could lick him all over
before he regained consciousness.'


393
0:23:53,682 --> 0:23:57,362
OK. Jump up on the bed
so I can have a look at you.


394
0:23:57,362 --> 0:23:58,922
'Oh, God.


395
0:23:58,922 --> 0:24:1,42
'He'll prod my tummy,


396
0:24:1,42 --> 0:24:4,283
'and the pathetic tampon holding back
the bloody flood will ping out.'


397
0:24:4,283 --> 0:24:5,802
Just relax.


398
0:24:5,802 --> 0:24:10,642
'Oh...


399
0:24:10,642 --> 0:24:12,522
'I can't...


400
0:24:12,522 --> 0:24:15,922
'hold... back!'


401
0:24:15,922 --> 0:24:22,82
Run! It's the mega period!


402
0:24:22,82 --> 0:24:23,523
So how's everything going?


403
0:24:23,523 --> 0:24:25,402
OK.
Good.


404
0:24:25,402 --> 0:24:27,2
You got enough meds?


405
0:24:27,2 --> 0:24:31,322
Yeah.


406
0:24:31,322 --> 0:24:33,601
So... I think it's just a heavy
period you're having.


407
0:24:33,601 --> 0:24:36,281
Painful and not nice,
but nothing more sinister than that.


408
0:24:36,281 --> 0:24:37,801
There is nothing to worry about.


409
0:24:37,801 --> 0:24:59,82
You starting your period is just
another milestone on the road to
health.


410
0:24:59,82 --> 0:25:2,42
I like your paperweight.


411
0:25:2,42 --> 0:25:6,762
See you, Rae.


412
0:25:6,762 --> 0:25:12,402
OK. We've had the results
of the urine sample. And...


413
0:25:12,402 --> 0:25:13,642
No, sorry.


414
0:25:13,642 --> 0:25:21,682
Ah.


415
0:25:21,682 --> 0:25:29,842
Ah...


416
0:25:29,842 --> 0:25:32,922
You...


417
0:25:32,922 --> 0:25:34,802
You are pregnant. Um...


418
0:25:34,802 --> 0:25:36,402
around four weeks.


419
0:25:36,402 --> 0:25:38,642
Um, I'd like an abortion.


420
0:25:38,642 --> 0:25:41,841
Yeah, well, that's certainly
an option you could consider.


421
0:25:41,841 --> 0:25:44,841
But you don't have to
decide anything today.


422
0:25:44,841 --> 0:25:46,401
We provide a counselling service


423
0:25:46,401 --> 0:25:48,281
where someone can talk to you on
a one...


424
0:25:48,281 --> 0:25:50,81
No, I don't want any of that.


425
0:25:50,81 --> 0:25:52,123
I just want to get it over with.


426
0:25:52,123 --> 0:25:53,242
Yeah, well, OK.


427
0:25:53,242 --> 0:25:55,441
It's up to me to make sure
you have every opportunity


428
0:25:55,441 --> 0:25:58,281
to make the decision
that's right for you, so...


429
0:25:58,281 --> 0:26:0,641
Let me book you in to see
one our advisors tomorrow,


430
0:26:0,641 --> 0:26:3,523
and then, if you still want to go
ahead, you know, hey, that's fine.


431
0:26:3,523 --> 0:26:7,42
Well, what happens... if she does?


432
0:26:7,42 --> 0:26:10,4
Well, if you do decide
to go ahead with it,


433
0:26:10,4 --> 0:26:11,968
then tomorrow you'll be given what's
called


434
0:26:11,968 --> 0:26:13,447
an early medical abortion pill.


435
0:26:13,447 --> 0:26:16,87
Then you'll take another one on
Saturday.


436
0:26:16,87 --> 0:26:17,809
Following the second treatment,


437
0:26:17,809 --> 0:26:21,608
you'll most likely want to be at
home afterwards.


438
0:26:21,608 --> 0:26:25,329
'And there's another thing
Chloe's better at than me...


439
0:26:25,329 --> 0:26:27,648
'..holding it together.


440
0:26:27,648 --> 0:26:31,7
'She's so strong in situations
where I'd crumble.


441
0:26:31,7 --> 0:26:33,889
'Like when the world is crushing down
on me.


442
0:26:33,889 --> 0:26:43,328
'Like when I...'


443
0:26:43,328 --> 0:26:51,528
You all right?


444
0:26:51,528 --> 0:27:3,608
Yeah. I'm fine.


445
0:27:3,608 --> 0:27:5,728
Well, thanks for coming.


446
0:27:5,728 --> 0:27:8,208
It's all right.


447
0:27:8,208 --> 0:27:11,329
I can come along with you tomorrow,
if you want.


448
0:27:11,329 --> 0:27:13,208
Nah.


449
0:27:13,208 --> 0:27:16,368
I'm going to take your advice.


450
0:27:16,368 --> 0:27:17,969
I'm going to tell Stephen tonight.


451
0:27:17,969 --> 0:27:21,608
He'll look after me.


452
0:27:21,608 --> 0:27:24,808
Well, what about Saturday
for the second pill?


453
0:27:24,808 --> 0:27:26,9
Everyone's going to be at Knebworth.


454
0:27:26,9 --> 0:27:28,848
Rae, Stephen'll look after me.


455
0:27:28,848 --> 0:27:32,208
You know... I'll be fine.


456
0:27:32,208 --> 0:27:34,248
I'll just...


457
0:27:34,248 --> 0:27:36,608
see you in a bit, then.


458
0:27:36,608 --> 0:27:46,608
OK.


459
0:27:46,608 --> 0:27:49,408
Well...


460
0:27:49,408 --> 0:27:52,328
you were right.


461
0:27:52,328 --> 0:27:55,848
I never thought I'd hear you say
that.


462
0:27:55,848 --> 0:27:58,328
I do miss her.


463
0:27:58,328 --> 0:28:2,448
But... things have changed.


464
0:28:2,448 --> 0:28:5,808
She's got a boyfriend now...


465
0:28:5,808 --> 0:28:11,88
and you don't need your friends as
much when you've got a boyfriend, do
you?


466
0:28:11,88 --> 0:28:12,488
At the last session,


467
0:28:12,488 --> 0:28:14,528
we never finished discussing


468
0:28:14,528 --> 0:28:17,209
what made you feel so angry towards
Chloe.


469
0:28:17,209 --> 0:28:19,368
I told you why.


470
0:28:19,368 --> 0:28:23,728
I gave you my fully detailed
psychological analysis.


471
0:28:23,728 --> 0:28:26,488
Yeah, but I never gave you mine.


472
0:28:26,488 --> 0:28:32,248
Do you want to hear it?


473
0:28:32,248 --> 0:28:35,847
A couple of weeks ago,
I had to pretend to be your uncle,


474
0:28:35,847 --> 0:28:40,368
because you haven't told anybody
out there that you've been ill.


475
0:28:40,368 --> 0:28:43,128
Including Chloe.


476
0:28:43,128 --> 0:28:44,889
And I think you might be angry
with her


477
0:28:44,889 --> 0:28:48,8
because you're starting to realise


478
0:28:48,8 --> 0:28:50,489
that maybe she's no longer the type
of friend


479
0:28:50,489 --> 0:28:53,928
that you can talk to about things.


480
0:28:53,928 --> 0:28:57,888
Oh, I couldn't give a rat's arse
what Chloe's like.


481
0:28:57,888 --> 0:29:1,448
I don't care about Chloe.
I care about you.


482
0:29:1,448 --> 0:29:3,648
And it is important to me


483
0:29:3,648 --> 0:29:5,849
that you've got somebody out there
you can talk to


484
0:29:5,849 --> 0:29:7,768
when things get dark,


485
0:29:7,768 --> 0:29:9,689
when you think about hurting
yourself.


486
0:29:9,689 --> 0:29:14,328
I've got my diary.
I can talk to that if things get bad.


487
0:29:14,328 --> 0:29:18,128
Yeah, well, you can leave things out
of a diary.


488
0:29:18,128 --> 0:29:25,88
You can rip out whole pages
and pretend they don't exist.


489
0:29:25,88 --> 0:29:30,48
This is my new home number.


490
0:29:30,48 --> 0:29:32,648
Now, I want you to call it.


491
0:29:32,648 --> 0:29:37,128
At any time, day or night.


492
0:29:37,128 --> 0:29:45,8
Whenever you start to feel...
you know.


493
0:29:45,8 --> 0:29:46,688
I don't need it.


494
0:29:46,688 --> 0:29:49,408
Rae!


495
0:29:49,408 --> 0:30:3,408
You're taking this piece of
paper. End of.


496
0:30:3,408 --> 0:30:5,488
'Short skirt,


497
0:30:5,488 --> 0:30:9,448
'girly top.


498
0:30:9,448 --> 0:30:13,488
'This is all new to me, being a girl.


499
0:30:13,488 --> 0:30:15,728
'It's difficult being quiet,


500
0:30:15,728 --> 0:30:18,888
'not telling jokes or swearing,


501
0:30:18,888 --> 0:30:23,608
'especially when the mega period
was becoming a super mega period.


502
0:30:23,608 --> 0:30:26,968
'I felt like my eyeballs were
sweating.'


503
0:30:26,968 --> 0:30:29,247
Right,
so if we get two crates of beer


504
0:30:29,247 --> 0:30:31,607
and a bottle of voddy for each car,
we're rocking.


505
0:30:31,607 --> 0:30:33,602
Raemundo, are you all right with
beer?


506
0:30:33,602 --> 0:30:36,994
Chop, you might enjoy
having a ridiculous nickname,


507
0:30:36,994 --> 0:30:38,394
but I don't.


508
0:30:38,394 --> 0:30:40,434
It's Rae or Rachel.


509
0:30:40,434 --> 0:30:42,674
What? Do you want beer or not?


510
0:30:42,674 --> 0:30:45,834
Not. I'd like some Lambrini.


511
0:30:45,834 --> 0:30:50,34
That's what I drink now.


512
0:30:50,34 --> 0:30:52,194
Oh, Jesus...


513
0:30:52,194 --> 0:30:55,434
All right, lads. Move up!


514
0:30:55,434 --> 0:30:59,114
Right, who's got any tune requests
for the trip?


515
0:30:59,114 --> 0:31:1,353
Because I am doing
the tapes for the cars.


516
0:31:1,353 --> 0:31:2,833
Why are you doing them?


517
0:31:2,833 --> 0:31:4,433
I know the most about music.


518
0:31:4,433 --> 0:31:8,954
You know about as much about music
as my mum.


519
0:31:8,954 --> 0:31:12,274
All right. But under no
circumstances,


520
0:31:12,274 --> 0:31:14,794
feature Spaceman by Babylon Zoo.


521
0:31:14,794 --> 0:31:16,914
No Babylon Zoo.


522
0:31:16,914 --> 0:31:19,953
Thank you very much for sharing
your in-depth knowledge of music


523
0:31:19,953 --> 0:31:21,315
with us, Rae, that's brilliant.


524
0:31:21,315 --> 0:31:23,514
Such a prick.


525
0:31:23,514 --> 0:31:28,394
Right, I took the liberty
of treating everyone.


526
0:31:28,394 --> 0:31:30,74
Little Al.


527
0:31:30,74 --> 0:31:31,673
Oh, yeah. Nice one, Chop!


528
0:31:31,673 --> 0:31:33,595
There you are, Finn.
Nice one, mate!


529
0:31:33,595 --> 0:31:38,794
Raemundo.


530
0:31:38,794 --> 0:31:41,434
What's up with you? You all right?


531
0:31:41,434 --> 0:31:43,154
No, I've...


532
0:31:43,154 --> 0:31:44,595
I've got a tummy ache.


533
0:31:44,595 --> 0:31:45,834
Oh, damn.


534
0:31:45,834 --> 0:31:50,834
Better be OK for tomorrow.
Like the shirt?


535
0:31:50,834 --> 0:31:52,873
Why don't you try it on?
I dunno.


536
0:31:52,873 --> 0:31:53,513
Try it on!


537
0:31:53,513 --> 0:31:54,913
Maybe I don't want to try it on!


538
0:31:54,913 --> 0:31:56,193
What's wrong with you?


539
0:31:56,193 --> 0:31:59,433
I told everyone that you was dead
cool and that you were dead funny.


540
0:31:59,433 --> 0:32:1,873
You've sat here all night
with a right face on.


541
0:32:1,873 --> 0:32:4,633
Well, maybe I can't win!
Maybe I just can't fucking win!


542
0:32:4,633 --> 0:32:7,195
No matter how hard I try,
I just can't get it right.


543
0:32:7,195 --> 0:32:18,394
I don't even know why I bother!


544
0:32:18,394 --> 0:32:23,194
Oh, crazy. Crazy. What are you doing?


545
0:32:23,194 --> 0:32:26,834
Stop being stupid.


546
0:32:26,834 --> 0:32:37,314
Stupid.


547
0:32:37,314 --> 0:32:38,354
No...


548
0:32:38,354 --> 0:32:39,874
No...


549
0:32:39,874 --> 0:33:26,194
No, no, no...


550
0:33:26,194 --> 0:33:31,714
Oh... my... God!


551
0:33:31,714 --> 0:33:33,794
Jabba's got a jam stain!


552
0:33:33,794 --> 0:33:36,34
I think I'm gonna be sick!


553
0:33:36,34 --> 0:33:37,993
I genuinely think I'm gonna be sick.


554
0:33:37,993 --> 0:33:40,995
Jabba's got a jam stain!
That's got to be the dirtiest thing


555
0:33:40,995 --> 0:33:43,674
I've ever seen.
You absolute scrubber.


556
0:33:43,674 --> 0:33:45,555
Scrubber!
Scrubber, scrubber, scrubber!


557
0:33:45,555 --> 0:33:52,354
Scrubber...


558
0:33:52,354 --> 0:33:53,793
What are you doing, you?


559
0:33:53,793 --> 0:33:56,273
It's all right taking the piss
out of a girl, isn't it?


560
0:33:56,273 --> 0:33:58,673
Well, why don't you try taking the
piss out of me?


561
0:33:58,673 --> 0:34:0,433
Eh? You apologise to her now


562
0:34:0,433 --> 0:34:2,995
or I will fucking curl you up,
all right?


563
0:34:2,995 --> 0:34:5,874
All right. I'm sorry! I'm sorry!


564
0:34:5,874 --> 0:34:8,341
And that goes for you two twats,
as well.


565
0:34:8,341 --> 0:34:14,901
Sorry.


566
0:34:14,901 --> 0:34:34,608
You all right?


567
0:34:34,608 --> 0:34:39,36
'Saturday, 10th August, 1996.


568
0:34:39,36 --> 0:34:41,516
'The Day of Knebworth!


569
0:34:41,516 --> 0:34:42,546
'Who'd have thought


570
0:34:42,546 --> 0:34:46,346
'the day I get to see
Liam Gallagher in the flesh,


571
0:34:46,346 --> 0:34:50,546
'all my thoughts would be
about another man?


572
0:34:50,546 --> 0:34:52,745
'How could I have got him so wrong?


573
0:34:52,745 --> 0:34:55,787
'How could I have thought
that he was shallow


574
0:34:55,787 --> 0:34:58,226
'when he's the most interesting,


575
0:34:58,226 --> 0:35:0,786
'sweet, sensitive,


576
0:35:0,786 --> 0:35:4,786
'hot-bodied Adonis
in all of Lincolnshire


577
0:35:4,786 --> 0:35:6,107
'and the surrounding districts?'


578
0:35:6,107 --> 0:35:15,94
Rae!


579
0:35:15,94 --> 0:35:17,774
I just bought, two days ago,


580
0:35:17,774 --> 0:35:20,534
on your request, 20 Tampax!


581
0:35:20,534 --> 0:35:22,14
20!


582
0:35:22,14 --> 0:35:24,666
And now there are
exactly none left.


583
0:35:24,666 --> 0:35:27,625
What have you got,
six vaginae or something?


584
0:35:27,625 --> 0:35:29,809
I decided to change them every hour.


585
0:35:29,809 --> 0:35:31,729
Every hour?!


586
0:35:31,729 --> 0:35:35,408
Your hoo-ha must be the driest place
in the entire universe.


587
0:35:35,408 --> 0:35:37,368
I didn't want to get toxic shock!


588
0:35:37,368 --> 0:35:40,88
Izzy told me about this girl
who left a tampon in too long.


589
0:35:40,88 --> 0:35:42,77
It went rotten, she got
multiple organ failure,


590
0:35:42,77 --> 0:35:45,649
then she went into
a coma and she died.


591
0:35:45,649 --> 0:35:51,489
Tox...?! You...!


592
0:35:51,489 --> 0:35:54,609
I just, er...


593
0:35:54,609 --> 0:35:56,169
I just...


594
0:35:56,169 --> 0:36:2,329
I just can't...


595
0:36:2,329 --> 0:36:5,369
This is my main meal for the day.


596
0:36:5,369 --> 0:36:7,9
What is it?


597
0:36:7,9 --> 0:36:9,369
Fucking Cup-a-Soup.


598
0:36:9,369 --> 0:36:12,489
Beef flavour.


599
0:36:12,489 --> 0:36:14,85
Maybe you should just
go back to solids.


600
0:36:14,85 --> 0:36:19,649
Oh... today's the last day.


601
0:36:19,649 --> 0:36:22,969
I just need to
make it till tomorrow.


602
0:36:22,969 --> 0:36:27,489
It's solids tomorrow. Then it's...


603
0:36:27,489 --> 0:36:31,729
I just... I need to
make it till tomorrow.


604
0:36:31,729 --> 0:36:33,409
I'll be all right.


605
0:36:33,409 --> 0:36:35,729
I'll be all right tomorrow.


606
0:36:35,729 --> 0:36:58,409
Just keep thinking about tomorrow.


607
0:36:58,409 --> 0:37:1,409
Knebworth, baby girl! Let's do this!


608
0:37:1,409 --> 0:37:5,916
You're in Barney's car
with Finn. Come on!


609
0:37:5,916 --> 0:37:7,27
Hi, Rae!


610
0:37:7,27 --> 0:37:11,27
Hey.


611
0:37:11,27 --> 0:37:12,907
Hiya.


612
0:37:12,907 --> 0:37:14,427
All right?


613
0:37:14,427 --> 0:37:16,707
How's your hand?


614
0:37:16,707 --> 0:37:18,147
I'll live.


615
0:37:18,147 --> 0:37:21,627
Thanks.


616
0:37:21,627 --> 0:37:24,188
Anyone would have done
the same thing, you know.


617
0:37:24,188 --> 0:37:27,507
No, they wouldn't.


618
0:37:27,507 --> 0:37:31,267
Right, everyone, this
convoy is heading out!


619
0:37:31,267 --> 0:37:32,868
Let's get ready! Let's do this.


620
0:37:32,868 --> 0:37:35,627
Raemundo, come on!


621
0:37:35,627 --> 0:37:37,427
Let's go!


622
0:37:37,427 --> 0:37:38,986
What are you doing here?


623
0:37:38,986 --> 0:37:41,68
I just thought I'd see everyone off.


624
0:37:41,68 --> 0:37:43,827
Did you tell him?


625
0:37:43,827 --> 0:37:45,147
We broke up.


626
0:37:45,147 --> 0:37:48,747
What?!


627
0:37:48,747 --> 0:37:51,67
Who's going with you today, then?


628
0:37:51,67 --> 0:37:53,267
Don't worry about it.


629
0:37:53,267 --> 0:37:58,707
Raemundo, come on, get your ass in
gear! We're ready to go. Come on!


630
0:37:58,707 --> 0:37:59,827
You'd better go.


631
0:37:59,827 --> 0:38:1,628
Chloe, are you sure
you're going to be all right?


632
0:38:1,628 --> 0:38:3,747
Yeah, I'll be fine.


633
0:38:3,747 --> 0:38:8,867
See you later.


634
0:38:8,867 --> 0:38:11,467
Let's go!


635
0:38:11,467 --> 0:38:22,427
Come on!


636
0:38:22,427 --> 0:38:23,867
What?


637
0:38:23,867 --> 0:38:26,546
I'm expecting marks out of
ten for each tune, by the way.


638
0:38:26,546 --> 0:38:28,868
Yeah, well, it's
a zero for starters.


639
0:38:28,868 --> 0:38:47,227
I thought this was
your favourite song.


640
0:38:47,227 --> 0:38:49,107
- Stop.
- What?


641
0:38:49,107 --> 0:39:19,27
Stop the car!


642
0:39:19,27 --> 0:39:21,668
You know, he'd just
split up with his ex.


643
0:39:21,668 --> 0:39:26,867
They were together like...
six years or something.


644
0:39:26,867 --> 0:39:28,384
So he's not really in the place


645
0:39:28,384 --> 0:39:32,504
to commit to something
new at the moment.


646
0:39:32,504 --> 0:39:40,384
Plus, he's a complete
knobhead wanker.


647
0:39:40,384 --> 0:39:43,67
Do you know, he had
a name for his thingy.


648
0:39:43,67 --> 0:39:44,79
What?


649
0:39:44,79 --> 0:39:46,247
Bob.


650
0:39:46,247 --> 0:39:46,807
Bob?


651
0:39:46,807 --> 0:39:57,447
Yeah.


652
0:39:57,447 --> 0:40:3,207
You know, I'm sorry about this week.


653
0:40:3,207 --> 0:40:6,167
Just sometimes I see you
with everyone,


654
0:40:6,167 --> 0:40:8,887
you know? The lads. And...


655
0:40:8,887 --> 0:40:12,247
you're so funny and clever. And...


656
0:40:12,247 --> 0:40:14,287
I just...


657
0:40:14,287 --> 0:40:18,487
I wish sometimes I'd get
the chance to be seen as funny.


658
0:40:18,487 --> 0:40:20,647
You are funny.


659
0:40:20,647 --> 0:40:25,807
Oh, Chloe, the boys all love you.


660
0:40:25,807 --> 0:40:29,607
I didn't get invited
to Knebworth, though, did I?


661
0:40:29,607 --> 0:40:48,447
Eh?


662
0:40:48,447 --> 0:40:50,487
I went to the market


663
0:40:50,487 --> 0:40:54,167
and I bought a jockstrap.


664
0:40:54,167 --> 0:40:56,687
I don't know why!


665
0:40:56,687 --> 0:40:58,367
Right, OK.


666
0:40:58,367 --> 0:41:0,527
I went to the market


667
0:41:0,527 --> 0:41:2,726
- and I bought a jockstrap...
- Oh!


668
0:41:2,726 --> 0:41:5,327
And a pineapple.


669
0:41:5,327 --> 0:42:7,687
- I went to the market...
- Miss Chloe Gemmell?


670
0:42:7,687 --> 0:42:10,487
You all right?


671
0:42:10,487 --> 0:42:14,767
Yeah, I think that's it now.


672
0:42:14,767 --> 0:42:16,527
Aw...!


673
0:42:16,527 --> 0:42:18,767
Listen to that crowd!


674
0:42:18,767 --> 0:42:22,847
I can almost smell
the burgers just frying


675
0:42:22,847 --> 0:42:28,127
in the stalls
at the side of the fields.


676
0:42:28,127 --> 0:42:28,767
Oh, no!


677
0:42:28,767 --> 0:42:30,327
Oh, no!
Oh, no, what?


678
0:42:30,327 --> 0:42:32,286
Some tall bastard's
just stood in front of me.


679
0:42:32,286 --> 0:42:34,6
I can't see the stage any more!


680
0:42:34,6 --> 0:42:36,126
Do you know what?
I fucking hate that!


681
0:42:36,126 --> 0:42:38,88
You can get on my
shoulders if you want!


682
0:42:38,88 --> 0:42:39,287
Yeah? Yeah.


683
0:42:39,287 --> 0:42:42,128
Oh. Maybe you should
get on my shoulders.


684
0:42:42,128 --> 0:42:47,287
Yeah.


685
0:42:47,287 --> 0:42:49,7
This is nice.


686
0:42:49,7 --> 0:42:50,328
Why don't we invite Izzy around?


687
0:42:50,328 --> 0:42:53,967
No.


688
0:42:53,967 --> 0:42:55,367
No, I...


689
0:42:55,367 --> 0:42:57,687
I like it when it's just us two.


690
0:42:57,687 --> 0:42:59,967
I love Izzy,


691
0:42:59,967 --> 0:43:10,967
but... but I think her head would've
exploded if I'd told her.


692
0:43:10,967 --> 0:43:16,967
Yeah. It needed to be you.


693
0:43:16,967 --> 0:43:18,327
Come here.


694
0:43:18,327 --> 0:43:21,407
Aw...


695
0:43:21,407 --> 0:43:35,567
You're all right, though, yeah?


696
0:43:35,567 --> 0:43:36,727
Chloe...


697
0:43:36,727 --> 0:43:39,447
Hmm?


698
0:43:39,447 --> 0:43:42,847
I wasn't in France this year.


699
0:43:42,847 --> 0:43:47,247
Where were you?


700
0:43:47,247 --> 0:43:49,607
I've been ill.


701
0:43:49,607 --> 0:43:53,887
What do you mean, ill?


702
0:43:53,887 --> 0:43:59,87
Like, proper ill?


703
0:43:59,87 --> 0:44:2,927
I did something stupid.


704
0:44:2,927 --> 0:44:9,7
I hurt myself.


705
0:44:9,7 --> 0:44:14,367
Why, Rae?


706
0:44:14,367 --> 0:44:24,927
Why would you do that?


707
0:44:24,927 --> 0:44:28,567
I've got it!


708
0:44:28,567 --> 0:44:31,887
Hello.


709
0:44:31,887 --> 0:44:35,207
Hiya.


710
0:44:35,207 --> 0:44:38,7
Yeah, I'm fine.


711
0:44:38,7 --> 0:44:43,47
Just listening to Knebworth. Why?


712
0:44:43,47 --> 0:44:46,247
Yeah, all right!


713
0:44:46,247 --> 0:44:52,527
All right, fine. Bye.


714
0:44:52,527 --> 0:44:56,87
That was Stephen.


715
0:44:56,87 --> 0:44:59,47
He wants to talk, so, um...


716
0:44:59,47 --> 0:45:2,807
I'm going to go round to his house.


717
0:45:2,807 --> 0:45:4,207
When?


718
0:45:4,207 --> 0:45:6,7
You know, I need to go.


719
0:45:6,7 --> 0:45:9,368
We'll talk about this
when I get back, I promise.


720
0:45:9,368 --> 0:45:10,967
Chloe, I...


721
0:45:10,967 --> 0:45:15,727
Rae, I really need to know
what he's got to say.


722
0:45:15,727 --> 0:45:18,808
Can you stay here so my
parents still think I'm in?


723
0:45:18,808 --> 0:45:20,47
What?


724
0:45:20,47 --> 0:45:23,208
Look, Rae, please! I'll be...
I'll be as quick as I can.


725
0:45:23,208 --> 0:45:26,7
OK? So just... just stay here.


726
0:45:26,7 --> 0:45:28,367
I'll be half an hour... tops.


727
0:45:28,367 --> 0:47:28,367
OK? Just don't move.
