0:0:13,112 --> 0:0:14,213
Paul: Yo, the white boat.


3
0:0:14,213 --> 0:0:15,281
You're too close.


4
0:0:15,281 --> 0:0:16,582
Pirate: This is bad.


5
0:0:16,582 --> 0:0:18,184
Ralph: The googans that come out
on the weekends don't really


6
0:0:18,184 --> 0:0:20,786
have a clue of what's going on.


7
0:0:20,786 --> 0:0:21,754
Bill: He's hooked up.


8
0:0:21,754 --> 0:0:23,556
Get the hell out of the way.


9
0:0:23,556 --> 0:0:25,391
Dave: We're on, again.


10
0:0:25,391 --> 0:0:27,626
We were able to hook up with
this guy parked five feet away


11
0:0:27,626 --> 0:0:28,327
from us.


12
0:0:28,327 --> 0:0:29,361
That's why we're the best.


13
0:0:29,361 --> 0:0:30,896
Bill: Yeah, we're really
struggling man.


14
0:0:30,896 --> 0:0:33,399
Tuna.com hooking up allthe time
is really starting to piss us


15
0:0:33,399 --> 0:0:34,9
off.


16
0:0:34,9 --> 0:0:37,36
Donna: I'll kill you.

<i> Narrator: Fishing is a hard
 life.</i>


18
0:0:38,704 --> 0:0:40,106

confrontation.

<i> Narrator: This is Wicked Tuna.</i>


29
0:1:6,332 --> 0:1:7,533
Dave: It's great to be on top.


30
0:1:7,533 --> 0:1:8,567
It's great to make all the
money.


31
0:1:8,567 --> 0:1:11,3
But with that, nobody likes a
winner.


32
0:1:11,3 --> 0:1:13,305
Marciano: For me the money
doesn't fall out of the sky, it


33
0:1:13,305 --> 0:1:15,207
comes out of the sea.


34
0:1:15,207 --> 0:1:16,609
Bill: This gets harder as you
get older.


35
0:1:16,609 --> 0:1:18,144
But I'm keeping up with the
young guns.


36
0:1:18,144 --> 0:1:19,278
Get out of the way.


37
0:1:19,278 --> 0:1:20,98
Ralph: If it's on my mind you're
gonna hear about it.


38
0:1:20,98 --> 0:1:21,947
And if you did something
to me, I'm gonna


39
0:1:21,947 --> 0:1:35,861
do something back to you.


40
0:1:35,861 --> 0:1:36,595
Ralph: All right, Pirate.


41
0:1:36,595 --> 0:1:37,296
We're gonna start the boat.


42
0:1:37,296 --> 0:1:43,802
Let's rock and roll.


43
0:1:43,802 --> 0:1:45,7
Cabin lights are off.


44
0:1:45,7 --> 0:1:45,571
You ready?


45
0:1:45,571 --> 0:1:46,438
Pirate: Yeah.


46
0:1:46,438 --> 0:1:48,507
Ralph: Here we go.


47
0:1:48,507 --> 0:1:50,843
All right, Pirate, we're
gonna go check out the bay


48
0:1:50,843 --> 0:1:51,777
today.


49
0:1:51,777 --> 0:1:53,546
From what
we hear there's been some


50
0:1:53,546 --> 0:1:56,48
fish caught close to the
beach here at Cape Cod Bay so


51
0:1:56,48 --> 0:1:57,55
we're gonna give
that a chance.


52
0:1:57,55 --> 0:1:58,751
I hate to fish
on the weekends,


53
0:1:58,751 --> 0:2:0,953
'cause there's so many idiots
and googans out there,


54
0:2:0,953 --> 0:2:2,755
it turns the ocean
into a parking lot.


55
0:2:2,755 --> 0:2:4,957
But the weather outlook for
the upcoming week is pretty


56
0:2:4,957 --> 0:2:7,92
(bleep), so I guess we have
no option but to fish this


57
0:2:7,92 --> 0:2:8,327
weekend.


58
0:2:8,327 --> 0:2:10,629
Pirate: These are the types
of bait we're using, is, uh,


59
0:2:10,629 --> 0:2:12,765
whiting right here.


60
0:2:12,765 --> 0:2:17,136
You get our butterfish,
squid, uh, herring.


61
0:2:17,136 --> 0:2:19,104
And what we're doing to it
is I've add some live bait.


62
0:2:19,104 --> 0:2:21,273
A little bit of a flush to
help you out on catching the


63
0:2:21,273 --> 0:2:22,474
fish.


64
0:2:22,474 --> 0:2:24,376
'Cause that little bit
of movement like that,


65
0:2:24,376 --> 0:2:26,679
the fish might see
that, and, whoosh!


66
0:2:26,679 --> 0:2:28,681
Go at it, instead of having
just kind of like a little


67
0:2:28,681 --> 0:2:31,483
bait fluttering around or
something like that, so.


68
0:2:31,483 --> 0:2:32,952
Hopefully a fish makes
a mistake and eats


69
0:2:32,952 --> 0:2:44,663
one of the baits for us.


70
0:2:44,663 --> 0:2:47,7
Paul: You (bleep) dirt bag.


71
0:2:47,7 --> 0:2:51,37
What are the odds of that
boat being on our numbers?


72
0:2:51,37 --> 0:2:54,39
What are the
(bleep) odds of it?


73
0:2:54,39 --> 0:2:55,507
Dave: There's definitely a
problem with fishing on the


74
0:2:55,507 --> 0:2:56,342
weekends.


75
0:2:56,342 --> 0:2:57,71
I come out here this morning.


76
0:2:57,71 --> 0:3:1,113
And this scumbag is sitting
right on my numbers to within


77
0:3:1,113 --> 0:3:2,781
50 feet.


78
0:3:2,781 --> 0:3:4,83
So.


79
0:3:4,83 --> 0:3:5,651
Yeah, I mean everybody, when
we're fishing we have certain


80
0:3:5,651 --> 0:3:6,952
numbers we like to fish.


81
0:3:6,952 --> 0:3:8,721
Coordinates,
latitude, longitude,


82
0:3:8,721 --> 0:3:10,155
time differentials.


83
0:3:10,155 --> 0:3:12,324
But these weekend warriors,
they follow the boats that


84
0:3:12,324 --> 0:3:14,159
catch fish, steal
our coordinates,


85
0:3:14,159 --> 0:3:17,863
and it's just absolutely
(bleep) disrespectful.


86
0:3:17,863 --> 0:3:19,298
Paul: Weekend warriors.


87
0:3:19,298 --> 0:3:21,634
The reason why we don't
like 'em next to us,


88
0:3:21,634 --> 0:3:24,703
it's because if we hook-up,
they don't know enough to


89
0:3:24,703 --> 0:3:26,672
clear their lines,
drop their anchor.


90
0:3:26,672 --> 0:3:28,274
They have no clue.


91
0:3:28,274 --> 0:3:29,642
You're gonna break 'em off.


92
0:3:29,642 --> 0:3:31,377
Sandro: That's a
big (bleep) boat.


93
0:3:31,377 --> 0:3:33,912
Dave: I was fishing
there every single day.


94
0:3:33,912 --> 0:3:36,849
I went in, I offloaded
a fish, came back out,


95
0:3:36,849 --> 0:3:38,751
and there he is
sitting on my numbers.


96
0:3:38,751 --> 0:3:39,952
Paul: Just go up
to him and say,


97
0:3:39,952 --> 0:3:42,655
"I've been here for
three (bleep) years."


98
0:3:42,655 --> 0:3:45,19
Tell him, "I'm
getting in this spot."


99
0:3:45,19 --> 0:3:48,6
Dave: He'll move.


100
0:3:48,6 --> 0:3:49,161
Can he anchor on my numbers?


101
0:3:49,161 --> 0:3:49,895
Absolutely.


102
0:3:49,895 --> 0:3:51,3
That's his right to do so.


103
0:3:51,3 --> 0:3:53,132
This is battle of
the turf right here.


104
0:3:53,132 --> 0:3:53,966
I'm gonna get it closer.


105
0:3:53,966 --> 0:3:54,9
Let me see.


106
0:3:54,9 --> 0:3:55,768
Wait, I might even
get closer to him.


107
0:3:55,768 --> 0:3:56,802
Hold on.


108
0:3:56,802 --> 0:4:3,776
Sandro, I want to get
closer to this guy.


109
0:4:3,776 --> 0:4:4,81
Dave: Let it go.


110
0:4:4,81 --> 0:4:6,945
Paul: Time to get the
(bleep) out of here.


111
0:4:6,945 --> 0:4:8,514
Dave: I basically anchored
right off his, uh,


112
0:4:8,514 --> 0:4:10,149
starboard bow, threw
the anchor there,


113
0:4:10,149 --> 0:4:11,417
and drifted back.


114
0:4:11,417 --> 0:4:13,152
Got tight on the anchor, and
I was literally two or three


115
0:4:13,152 --> 0:4:14,386
boat lengths away from 'em.


116
0:4:14,386 --> 0:4:20,25
(Bleep).


117
0:4:20,25 --> 0:4:21,727
Paul: Right in 'em.


118
0:4:21,727 --> 0:4:23,295
Hi.


119
0:4:23,295 --> 0:4:24,697
Dave: If he was
smart he'd move.


120
0:4:24,697 --> 0:4:26,598
And if has something to say,
he can come to the dock and


121
0:4:26,598 --> 0:4:29,101
say it to my face later.


122
0:4:29,101 --> 0:4:31,87
If you're gonna be a
man, go toe to toe.


123
0:4:31,87 --> 0:4:33,339
Sandro: Heard about a
bunch of fights on sea,


124
0:4:33,339 --> 0:4:35,14
but I've never
actually seen one, so.


125
0:4:35,14 --> 0:4:36,141
Paul: See it a lot.


126
0:4:36,141 --> 0:4:37,9
Sandro: What's that?


127
0:4:37,9 --> 0:4:38,277
Dave: See a lot of
fights out here.


128
0:4:38,277 --> 0:4:40,679
Paul: Dude, one guy (bleep)
backed up to the guy in the


129
0:4:40,679 --> 0:4:43,716
middle of the ocean,
jumped on his boat,


130
0:4:43,716 --> 0:4:46,85
punched the (bleep) out
of him, knocked him out,


131
0:4:46,85 --> 0:4:48,554
got back on his
boat and drove away.


132
0:4:48,554 --> 0:4:56,862
Dave: He's gotta deal with
it, or he's gotta move.


133
0:4:56,862 --> 0:4:58,597
Marciano: We're
in New England.


134
0:4:58,597 --> 0:4:59,798
We're late in the season.


135
0:4:59,798 --> 0:5:2,334
It's November, 'cause this
time of year the weather's


136
0:5:2,334 --> 0:5:3,902
very unstable.


137
0:5:3,902 --> 0:5:6,71
We're gonna lose
the next two days,


138
0:5:6,71 --> 0:5:8,807
possibly even three days,
because there's gonna be too


139
0:5:8,807 --> 0:5:11,643
much wind for us to
come out here and fish.


140
0:5:11,643 --> 0:5:13,979
So I had to try this weekend.


141
0:5:13,979 --> 0:5:16,48
Middle Bank's gonna be mobbed
this weekend with the weekend


142
0:5:16,48 --> 0:5:19,952
warriors, the part-timers
and the ferryboats.


143
0:5:19,952 --> 0:5:23,55
We're gonna go up to one of
my secret spots up on, uh,


144
0:5:23,55 --> 0:5:24,556
Jeffreys Ledge.


145
0:5:24,556 --> 0:5:43,742
And we're gonna
just find some fish.


146
0:5:43,742 --> 0:5:47,613
Ralph: Yo, it's
unbelievable here today.


147
0:5:47,613 --> 0:5:52,284
Now we got this guy anchoring
up next to us here now?


148
0:5:52,284 --> 0:5:54,853
Gonna (bleep) have all these
guys all over you today.


149
0:5:54,853 --> 0:5:56,455
It's gonna be ridiculous.


150
0:5:56,455 --> 0:5:58,824
Cut their lines
off with the fish.


151
0:5:58,824 --> 0:6:0,692
Teach 'em a lesson.


152
0:6:0,692 --> 0:6:2,995
Giant tuna fishing we
have the commercial guys,


153
0:6:2,995 --> 0:6:6,31
we have the sport guys, and
then we have the googans.


154
0:6:6,31 --> 0:6:8,167
Come on, what's the
matter with you guys?


155
0:6:8,167 --> 0:6:9,802
Why you driving around?


156
0:6:9,802 --> 0:6:11,69
Get the (bleep) out of here.


157
0:6:11,69 --> 0:6:14,506
The googans are kind of like
sport guys, in small boats.


158
0:6:14,506 --> 0:6:14,907
Come on.


159
0:6:14,907 --> 0:6:15,374
Come on.


160
0:6:15,374 --> 0:6:16,108
Slow down.


161
0:6:16,108 --> 0:6:18,644
Slow down.


162
0:6:18,644 --> 0:6:20,145
That's an idiot for you.


163
0:6:20,145 --> 0:6:22,281
That come out on the weekends
and don't really have a clue


164
0:6:22,281 --> 0:6:25,25
what's going on.


165
0:6:25,25 --> 0:6:28,387
Pirate: Waaaaah.


166
0:6:28,387 --> 0:6:30,856
Ralph: Yo, you're too close.


167
0:6:30,856 --> 0:6:32,9
Hey!


168
0:6:32,9 --> 0:6:34,426
Yo!


169
0:6:34,426 --> 0:6:34,96
Yo!


170
0:6:34,96 --> 0:6:41,133
The white boat!


171
0:6:41,133 --> 0:6:43,268
Rules are, you usually, you
give a boat a quarter of a


172
0:6:43,268 --> 0:6:44,236
mile.


173
0:6:44,236 --> 0:6:46,839
When there's a boat
20 yards from you,


174
0:6:46,839 --> 0:6:49,341
and they don't realize what
happens is the tide is gonna


175
0:6:49,341 --> 0:6:50,476
turn.


176
0:6:50,476 --> 0:6:52,311
Everybody swings, and you
know, on the next tide,


177
0:6:52,311 --> 0:6:54,48
you're float or balloon
is in his anchor line.


178
0:6:54,48 --> 0:6:55,881
And if you get a
bite, you're gonna


179
0:6:55,881 --> 0:6:57,95
lose the fish right off.


180
0:6:57,95 --> 0:6:59,51
Hey, little white boat.


181
0:6:59,51 --> 0:7:0,919
Come in.


182
0:7:0,919 --> 0:7:2,888
Come on, pick me up on 69,
you want to talk on the


183
0:7:2,888 --> 0:7:3,622
radio?


184
0:7:3,622 --> 0:7:7,426
Come on.


185
0:7:7,426 --> 0:7:8,66
Yeah, you can't stay there.


186
0:7:8,66 --> 0:7:11,263
My balloons are going
under your anchor line.


187
0:7:11,263 --> 0:7:12,431
You just got out here.


188
0:7:12,431 --> 0:7:14,99
We're here since
4:30 this morning.


189
0:7:14,99 --> 0:7:18,77
You can't just drop
there like that.


190
0:7:18,77 --> 0:7:21,106
Man: What do you mean,
you're under my anchor line?


191
0:7:21,106 --> 0:7:23,575
Ralph: The balloons are
going towards your boat.


192
0:7:23,575 --> 0:7:26,278
If I get a bite, I'm
under your anchor line.


193
0:7:26,278 --> 0:7:29,314
I don't want to
deal with that.


194
0:7:29,314 --> 0:7:29,615
Man: Wah.


195
0:7:29,615 --> 0:7:29,915
Wah.


196
0:7:29,915 --> 0:7:31,25
Wah.


197
0:7:31,25 --> 0:7:32,484
Ralph: They're over there
with orange pants like they


198
0:7:32,484 --> 0:7:34,753
know what they're doing.


199
0:7:34,753 --> 0:7:36,622
They should require a test
before you get a pair of


200
0:7:36,622 --> 0:7:38,23
orange pants.


201
0:7:38,23 --> 0:7:39,791
On the weekends, you want
to get your own spot,


202
0:7:39,791 --> 0:7:41,994
protect it, fight the other
boats off from getting too


203
0:7:41,994 --> 0:7:44,897
close to you, which probably
means you're gonna be yelling


204
0:7:44,897 --> 0:7:46,698
and screaming and
cursing a lot.


205
0:7:46,698 --> 0:7:49,868
But, it usually pays off.


206
0:7:49,868 --> 0:7:51,904
Why don't you just wind your
lines up and go somewhere


207
0:7:51,904 --> 0:7:53,772
else?


208
0:7:53,772 --> 0:7:54,84
Man: Why don't you
mind your business?


209
0:7:54,84 --> 0:7:56,708
Ralph: No, this is
my (bleep) business.


210
0:7:56,708 --> 0:7:58,577
This ain't your
(bleep) business.


211
0:7:58,577 --> 0:8:0,245
Go to work!


212
0:8:0,245 --> 0:8:2,147
This is what I do
to feed my family,


213
0:8:2,147 --> 0:8:4,249
and you're (bleep) with me!


214
0:8:4,249 --> 0:8:5,517
Man: How am I doing that?


215
0:8:5,517 --> 0:8:6,952
Ralph: Well, because you're
drifting right down the side


216
0:8:6,952 --> 0:8:8,12
of my boat.


217
0:8:8,12 --> 0:8:10,122
You're fishing where
everybody's (bleep) anchored.


218
0:8:10,122 --> 0:8:12,9
You're an (bleep).


219
0:8:12,9 --> 0:8:12,891
Man: No, that's you.


220
0:8:12,891 --> 0:8:15,327
Ralph: Yeah, I'm an (bleep)?


221
0:8:15,327 --> 0:8:16,929
We're gonna get off the
anchor and go (bleep) chase


222
0:8:16,929 --> 0:8:30,42
'em off.


223
0:8:30,42 --> 0:8:33,11
Donna: Where the
hell are you going?


224
0:8:33,11 --> 0:8:34,98
Bill: I don't
know where to go.


225
0:8:34,98 --> 0:8:36,615
We got a late start today.


226
0:8:36,615 --> 0:8:38,417
We heard there was a
biting on Cape Cod,


227
0:8:38,417 --> 0:8:40,552
but we're having a hard
time finding a spot.


228
0:8:40,552 --> 0:8:42,821
Between all the other
fishermen and the googans,


229
0:8:42,821 --> 0:8:44,756
it's like a parking
lot out there.


230
0:8:44,756 --> 0:8:48,36
I'm trying to get in that
line, that line of boats,


231
0:8:48,36 --> 0:8:50,395
'cause that's where
the bites were.


232
0:8:50,395 --> 0:8:52,397
Donna: Need to get
further that way.


233
0:8:52,397 --> 0:8:56,134
Bill: That's not easy to do.


234
0:8:56,134 --> 0:8:58,203
Donna: You need to get
in the line that way.


235
0:8:58,203 --> 0:9:0,339
That, you can
see the pattern.


236
0:9:0,339 --> 0:9:1,807
What the (bleep) is he doing?


237
0:9:1,807 --> 0:9:3,375
Scott: Go yell
at him, will ya?


238
0:9:3,375 --> 0:9:5,477
Donna: Oh, I can be
very vocal, yeah.


239
0:9:5,477 --> 0:9:6,511
Definitely.


240
0:9:6,511 --> 0:9:8,313
I let him know if I
don't like something.


241
0:9:8,313 --> 0:9:8,914
Listen, listen.


242
0:9:8,914 --> 0:9:9,681
Bill: What?


243
0:9:9,681 --> 0:9:10,949
I'm gonna pull in back there.


244
0:9:10,949 --> 0:9:13,151
Donna: You need to go, do you
see where the hookups are?


245
0:9:13,151 --> 0:9:14,886
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.


246
0:9:14,886 --> 0:9:16,855
Bill: I know, but I
can't get in there.


247
0:9:16,855 --> 0:9:17,923
Donna: Yeah you can.


248
0:9:17,923 --> 0:9:19,558
Bill: If he wasn't there
I could get in there.


249
0:9:19,558 --> 0:9:20,659
Donna: Who, Pete?


250
0:9:20,659 --> 0:9:21,827
Go around Pete.


251
0:9:21,827 --> 0:9:23,61
Bill: I can't go around him.


252
0:9:23,61 --> 0:9:24,129
Where am I going
to put the anchor?


253
0:9:24,129 --> 0:9:25,764
I can't drop it while
he's fighting a fish.


254
0:9:25,764 --> 0:9:27,933
Donna: Some days when what
he's doing might not be


255
0:9:27,933 --> 0:9:31,269
working, I'd like him to
try something else and he's


256
0:9:31,269 --> 0:9:35,7
stubborn and we get into it
a little bit on the boat.


257
0:9:35,7 --> 0:9:37,142
Bill: No, they're all
in front of the nets.


258
0:9:37,142 --> 0:9:37,909
That's where they are.


259
0:9:37,909 --> 0:9:39,911
Donna: Well, what's his face.


260
0:9:39,911 --> 0:9:40,779
Bill: The nets don't go.


261
0:9:40,779 --> 0:9:42,18
They're not
perfectly lined up.


262
0:9:42,18 --> 0:9:43,148
I went over there.


263
0:9:43,148 --> 0:9:44,583
There's no place to anchor.


264
0:9:44,583 --> 0:9:46,685
Donna: That's the line that
they caught the fish in.


265
0:9:46,685 --> 0:9:48,353
Bill: Listen, Pete's anchor.


266
0:9:48,353 --> 0:9:49,788
Donna: Yeah, it's over here.


267
0:9:49,788 --> 0:9:51,79
Bill: No, that's
Frankie's anchor.


268
0:9:51,79 --> 0:9:53,225
Donna: I'm just telling you.


269
0:9:53,225 --> 0:9:56,28
That's where the line is.


270
0:9:56,28 --> 0:9:59,698
We haven't had a lot of luck,
uh, so far this season.


271
0:9:59,698 --> 0:10:2,34
Uh, we've lost a lot of fish.


272
0:10:2,34 --> 0:10:3,235
A lot of big fish.


273
0:10:3,235 --> 0:10:4,836
If we don't catch
some fish pretty soon,


274
0:10:4,836 --> 0:10:8,4
I'm not gonna be able
to pay my mortgage.


275
0:10:8,4 --> 0:10:10,542
You know, this whole thing
is really driving me crazy.


276
0:10:10,542 --> 0:10:12,511
It's hard enough
to deal with, uh,


277
0:10:12,511 --> 0:10:14,713
the challenges of
catching these fish.


278
0:10:14,713 --> 0:10:17,349
Never mind having to deal
with all these googans.


279
0:10:17,349 --> 0:10:27,592
Bill: (Bleep).


280
0:10:27,592 --> 0:10:28,827
Dave: Unbelievable.


281
0:10:28,827 --> 0:10:31,997
These guys are still anchored
on our (bleep) numbers.


282
0:10:31,997 --> 0:10:32,998
But whatever.


283
0:10:32,998 --> 0:10:34,232
We can't let it get to us.


284
0:10:34,232 --> 0:10:35,734
The bottom line is that we
got to catch fish before the


285
0:10:35,734 --> 0:10:45,343
storm comes in this weekend.


286
0:10:45,343 --> 0:10:48,46
Paul: Get some bait for the
hooks see if we can catch a


287
0:10:48,46 --> 0:10:49,181
couple here.


288
0:10:49,181 --> 0:10:50,15
This is a good day.


289
0:10:50,15 --> 0:10:50,615
It's nice.


290
0:10:50,615 --> 0:10:51,45
It's dark today.


291
0:10:51,45 --> 0:11:3,95
Perfect.


292
0:11:3,95 --> 0:11:4,329
Sandro: We're on, we're
on, we're on, we're on!


293
0:11:4,329 --> 0:11:4,93
Paul: Yeah.


294
0:11:4,93 --> 0:11:8,2
Start it up!


295
0:11:8,2 --> 0:11:9,801
Get the engine, Dave!


296
0:11:9,801 --> 0:11:12,304
Dave: I'll get the engine!


297
0:11:12,304 --> 0:11:15,34
Paul: We just hooked up.


298
0:11:15,34 --> 0:11:16,775
Nice!


299
0:11:16,775 --> 0:11:22,447
Sandro: (Bleep) tuna.


300
0:11:22,447 --> 0:11:25,684
Good, good, good, good.


301
0:11:25,684 --> 0:11:29,87
Paul: Good job, buddy.


302
0:11:29,87 --> 0:11:30,689
Dave: Ready for a swap?


303
0:11:30,689 --> 0:11:31,556
Sandro: Yeah, go ahead.


304
0:11:31,556 --> 0:11:32,457
Dave: We're hooked
up right now,


305
0:11:32,457 --> 0:11:33,458
but this guy's so (bleep)


306
0:11:33,458 --> 0:11:35,727
close to us, if our
lines hit his lines,


307
0:11:35,727 --> 0:11:37,95
they're gonna
break right away.


308
0:11:37,95 --> 0:11:39,564
There's so much pressure when
you have a 300-pound fish on,


309
0:11:39,564 --> 0:11:48,573
anything can break the line.


310
0:11:48,573 --> 0:11:49,875
Dave: Swivel.


311
0:11:49,875 --> 0:11:51,176
Forward, forward, forward!


312
0:11:51,176 --> 0:11:51,81
Color.


313
0:11:51,81 --> 0:11:52,444
Right here, Paul.


314
0:11:52,444 --> 0:11:54,846
Right here.


315
0:11:54,846 --> 0:12:7,125
Don't miss, Paul.


316
0:12:7,125 --> 0:12:8,26
Got one.


317
0:12:8,26 --> 0:12:10,462
Paul: Yeah.


318
0:12:10,462 --> 0:12:13,732
We got him.


319
0:12:13,732 --> 0:12:15,0
Dave: Yeah, even though
this guy stole our spot,


320
0:12:15,0 --> 0:12:17,235
we hooked up and he didn't.


321
0:12:17,235 --> 0:12:18,703
Yeah, you know we
know what we're doing.


322
0:12:18,703 --> 0:12:21,973
And there's a reason why
we're one of the best.


323
0:12:21,973 --> 0:12:22,941
Paul: You're unreal!


324
0:12:22,941 --> 0:12:26,144
Sandro: Oh, God.


325
0:12:26,144 --> 0:12:28,547
Dave: Hey, you guys think you
can give me a little room?


326
0:12:28,547 --> 0:12:30,182
Paul: That's way too close!


327
0:12:30,182 --> 0:12:32,517
Dave: Go down there a
little bit, come on!


328
0:12:32,517 --> 0:12:36,54
You guys gotta be (bleep) me!


329
0:12:36,54 --> 0:12:38,19
(Bleep) unbelievable.


330
0:12:38,19 --> 0:12:39,591
Paul: He's done.


331
0:12:39,591 --> 0:12:41,76
We just gotta bury the
(bleep) out of him now with


332
0:12:41,76 --> 0:12:43,862
this ice and the buckets.


333
0:12:43,862 --> 0:12:45,764
Dave: Good job, boys.


334
0:12:45,764 --> 0:12:48,2
Dave: Yeah, that's a three,
400 pound fish there, maybe.


335
0:12:48,2 --> 0:12:50,902
That'll bring us between, you
know, three, 4,000 dollars.


336
0:12:50,902 --> 0:12:52,137
Pretty good day.


337
0:12:52,137 --> 0:12:53,839
Paul: He's already
ready to ship now.


338
0:12:53,839 --> 0:12:55,273
Ha, ha, ha.


339
0:12:55,273 --> 0:13:1,847
Dude, he's all done.


340
0:13:1,847 --> 0:13:5,35
Donna: You know,
this is like torture.


341
0:13:5,35 --> 0:13:8,153
I got no fish to work with.


342
0:13:8,153 --> 0:13:10,789
But I see other
guys hooking up.


343
0:13:10,789 --> 0:13:14,392
The boat's got the plague
or something, I don't know.


344
0:13:14,392 --> 0:13:17,996
This'll make you quit
this, right here.


345
0:13:17,996 --> 0:13:19,397
Bill: You'll be fine.


346
0:13:19,397 --> 0:13:21,466
Donna: Yeah?


347
0:13:21,466 --> 0:13:23,401
Don't count on it.


348
0:13:23,401 --> 0:13:28,206
I've about had it
with this (bleep).


349
0:13:28,206 --> 0:13:30,308
Come on fish,
give me a chance!


350
0:13:30,308 --> 0:13:36,715
I'll kill you!


351
0:13:36,715 --> 0:13:37,549
I'll give you a
run for the money.


352
0:13:37,549 --> 0:13:40,18
Bill: She's a
beautiful or what.


353
0:13:40,18 --> 0:13:41,353
Her teeth are grinding.


354
0:13:41,353 --> 0:13:43,655
Donna: Aaah!


355
0:13:43,655 --> 0:13:51,429
I'm so irritated.


356
0:13:51,429 --> 0:13:52,764
Ralph: Hey, Billy.


357
0:13:52,764 --> 0:13:54,466
Are you there?


358
0:13:54,466 --> 0:13:56,501
Bill: Dot Com got
one first thing.


359
0:13:56,501 --> 0:13:57,836
Ralph: Really?


360
0:13:57,836 --> 0:13:59,17
Bill: Yeah, big one.


361
0:13:59,17 --> 0:14:0,338
Ralph: Holy cow.


362
0:14:0,338 --> 0:14:1,74
What the (bleep) he doing?


363
0:14:1,74 --> 0:14:3,174
I can't get a bite over here.


364
0:14:3,174 --> 0:14:5,343
So I get stuck listening
about Tuna.com catching


365
0:14:5,343 --> 0:14:7,846
another fish, and I can't get
a line in the water with all


366
0:14:7,846 --> 0:14:9,347
these (bleep)
googans around here.


367
0:14:9,347 --> 0:14:10,515
It's ridiculous.


368
0:14:10,515 --> 0:14:12,45
(Bleep) Tuna.com.


369
0:14:12,45 --> 0:14:13,451
I can't worry about him.


370
0:14:13,451 --> 0:14:15,186
Have to worry about
catching one myself.


371
0:14:15,186 --> 0:14:27,565
I'll talk to you
later, Billy.


372
0:14:27,565 --> 0:14:28,433
Marciano: Well
here we are today.


373
0:14:28,433 --> 0:14:30,1
We're out on Jeffreys Ledge.


374
0:14:30,1 --> 0:14:33,338
We're about 25 miles from
where we left those guys on


375
0:14:33,338 --> 0:14:34,606
Middle Bank.


376
0:14:34,606 --> 0:14:36,641
Nothing's going on at Middle
Bank because there's nothing


377
0:14:36,641 --> 0:14:39,44
but (bleep) weekend
warriors down there,


378
0:14:39,44 --> 0:14:40,779
making it real hard to fish.


379
0:14:40,779 --> 0:14:42,914
So I decided just to
roll the dice today.


380
0:14:42,914 --> 0:14:45,65
Come up here and do something
I wouldn't normally do.


381
0:14:45,65 --> 0:14:47,285
We're off on our own.


382
0:14:47,285 --> 0:14:49,12
Nobody's followed
us here yet.


383
0:14:49,12 --> 0:14:51,589
We've seen fish before we
even got ready to fishing.


384
0:14:51,589 --> 0:14:52,691
Now I've got a few rods out.


385
0:14:52,691 --> 0:14:54,926
We're waiting for 'em
to come through again.


386
0:14:54,926 --> 0:14:56,761
See if we can get
a rod to bend.


387
0:14:56,761 --> 0:14:57,696
Jay: Bend!


388
0:14:57,696 --> 0:14:59,397
Why?


389
0:14:59,397 --> 0:15:0,498
Come on.


390
0:15:0,498 --> 0:15:3,435
Just please sing to me.


391
0:15:3,435 --> 0:15:4,602
Marciano: What are you doing?


392
0:15:4,602 --> 0:15:6,972
Jay: Waiting.


393
0:15:6,972 --> 0:15:8,206
Marciano: Chum to me.


394
0:15:8,206 --> 0:15:9,307
What's that on your face?


395
0:15:9,307 --> 0:15:12,21
It looks like chum to me.


396
0:15:12,21 --> 0:15:15,547
We have been protecting the
stocks of bluefin tuna in


397
0:15:15,547 --> 0:15:19,317
this country for better
than 20 years, all right?


398
0:15:19,317 --> 0:15:23,54
We've come a long way from
lowest levels ever recorded.


399
0:15:23,54 --> 0:15:23,888
We set limits.


400
0:15:23,888 --> 0:15:25,19
We set boundaries.


401
0:15:25,19 --> 0:15:27,25
We're not like a lot
of other countries,


402
0:15:27,25 --> 0:15:28,727
who don't have
all those limits.


403
0:15:28,727 --> 0:15:30,595
Jay, clean up this
(bleep) mess, too,


404
0:15:30,595 --> 0:15:35,3
(bleep) Christ's sakes.


405
0:15:35,3 --> 0:15:36,468
All right, here
they come, Jay.


406
0:15:36,468 --> 0:15:38,303
They're coming up
from the bottom.


407
0:15:38,303 --> 0:15:40,38
They're racing right up.


408
0:15:40,38 --> 0:15:45,944
Any minute now, that
rod's gonna bend.


409
0:15:45,944 --> 0:15:47,479
Jay: Shark, right here!


410
0:15:47,479 --> 0:15:49,381
Ah yeah, he's
frickin' hauling!


411
0:15:49,381 --> 0:15:51,316
Zipping all around!


412
0:15:51,316 --> 0:15:52,55
Oh, he's big.


413
0:15:52,55 --> 0:15:54,886
We don't want him to
bite the hook or nothing.


414
0:15:54,886 --> 0:15:56,688
We just want him to
get the hell away.


415
0:15:56,688 --> 0:15:57,255
Look at him!


416
0:15:57,255 --> 0:15:59,724
I could touch him!


417
0:15:59,724 --> 0:16:8,833
Those blue sharks
got big mouths.


418
0:16:8,833 --> 0:16:10,468
Marciano: For a brief moment
we got a little excited.


419
0:16:10,468 --> 0:16:13,38
We thought we were on
a, on to a tuna fish.


420
0:16:13,38 --> 0:16:14,472
But it was just a blue shark.


421
0:16:14,472 --> 0:16:16,574
Gonna get some fresh baits
out and see if we can get the


422
0:16:16,574 --> 0:16:26,551
target species,
the bluefin tunas.


423
0:16:26,551 --> 0:16:28,86
Dave: Yeah, we had a problem
with that googan parked right


424
0:16:28,86 --> 0:16:29,254
next to us.


425
0:16:29,254 --> 0:16:30,989
But we friggin' showed them,
and nobody else caught


426
0:16:30,989 --> 0:16:32,891
anything so we're
doing great.


427
0:16:32,891 --> 0:16:34,259
We got a 300
pounder in the back,


428
0:16:34,259 --> 0:16:37,395
but considering it was over
all 300 dollars for fuel,


429
0:16:37,395 --> 0:16:40,865
bait, food, and a
fish back there,


430
0:16:40,865 --> 0:16:42,767
eh, probably 3,000 dollars.


431
0:16:42,767 --> 0:16:45,27
So, it's a pretty good
profitable day, 2,500


432
0:16:45,27 --> 0:16:46,471
dollars in the
pocket, and we had a


433
0:16:46,471 --> 0:16:47,238
good time doing it.


434
0:16:47,238 --> 0:16:55,346
So, I'm happy.


435
0:16:55,346 --> 0:16:58,416
Man: So the tuna gods have
been good to you again, huh?


436
0:16:58,416 --> 0:17:0,518
They've been doing real good
with the price on these,


437
0:17:0,518 --> 0:17:1,319
Dave.


438
0:17:1,319 --> 0:17:2,53
Dave: Have they really?


439
0:17:2,53 --> 0:17:2,921
Man: On these smaller fish.


440
0:17:2,921 --> 0:17:4,55
Dave: Really?


441
0:17:4,55 --> 0:17:5,657
Man: They've been doing
real good with the price.


442
0:17:5,657 --> 0:17:6,858
Dave: Whatever, I'll take it.


443
0:17:6,858 --> 0:17:8,96
Man: Yeah, they've been doing
like 18 dollars a pound.


444
0:17:8,96 --> 0:17:9,828
Dave: Really?


445
0:17:9,828 --> 0:17:10,962
Man: Yeah, for
these little ones.


446
0:17:10,962 --> 0:17:13,98
Dave: Hey, Paul.


447
0:17:13,98 --> 0:17:14,365
Paul: Yeah.


448
0:17:14,365 --> 0:17:15,934
Dave: He said these little
fish have been paying like 18


449
0:17:15,934 --> 0:17:16,768
dollars a pound.


450
0:17:16,768 --> 0:17:19,604
Paul: Really?


451
0:17:19,604 --> 0:17:20,305
All right.


452
0:17:20,305 --> 0:17:22,14
Dave: Double what we said.


453
0:17:22,14 --> 0:17:26,44
That might be four or 5,000.


454
0:17:26,44 --> 0:17:28,413
I'll take that.


455
0:17:28,413 --> 0:17:31,716
Yeah, as it turned out it
was a high quality fish,


456
0:17:31,716 --> 0:17:33,852
and better quality the
meat the higher the value.


457
0:17:33,852 --> 0:17:35,32
It sounds like we may
get between five and


458
0:17:35,32 --> 0:17:37,21
6,000 or something.


459
0:17:37,21 --> 0:17:52,7
That was a good day.


460
0:17:52,7 --> 0:17:53,938
Marciano: So we spent the
night on Jeffreys Ledge,


461
0:17:53,938 --> 0:17:57,275
away from all the dumbass
weekend warriors.


462
0:17:57,275 --> 0:17:59,144
Jay is still down below
getting a little beauty


463
0:17:59,144 --> 0:18:0,545
sleep.


464
0:18:0,545 --> 0:18:12,991
I'm gonna see if I can catch
a tuna while he's down there.


465
0:18:12,991 --> 0:18:16,294
We're gonna roll the
dice one more time,


466
0:18:16,294 --> 0:18:18,663
and see what happens.


467
0:18:18,663 --> 0:18:19,898
Oh, but there's a big fish.


468
0:18:19,898 --> 0:18:24,35
There's a big fish now
marking on the screen.


469
0:18:24,35 --> 0:18:25,77
That's the one we want.


470
0:18:25,77 --> 0:18:28,406
We're scraping the proverbial
bottom of the barrel with


471
0:18:28,406 --> 0:18:30,708
last sexy herring.


472
0:18:30,708 --> 0:18:38,349
Last roll of the
dice right here.


473
0:18:38,349 --> 0:18:40,818
The fish we just
marked was a big fish.


474
0:18:40,818 --> 0:18:43,588
We get that little
puppy to bite, we could,


475
0:18:43,588 --> 0:18:47,58
we're gonna come out
of this day just fine.


476
0:18:47,58 --> 0:18:49,394
Just fine.


477
0:18:49,394 --> 0:18:53,198
OK, let's take a look.


478
0:18:53,198 --> 0:18:55,3
Oh, hey there.


479
0:18:55,3 --> 0:19:1,573
That's like a (bleep) shark.


480
0:19:1,573 --> 0:19:3,908
Ah ha!


481
0:19:3,908 --> 0:19:5,31
All right, now I'm
getting aggravated.


482
0:19:5,31 --> 0:19:8,546
That was my last
(bleep) herring.


483
0:19:8,546 --> 0:19:10,181
You can tell it's a shark
just by the way it's


484
0:19:10,181 --> 0:19:10,748
fighting.


485
0:19:10,748 --> 0:19:11,95
It's real lazy.


486
0:19:11,95 --> 0:19:15,386
Real blah, blah, blah.


487
0:19:15,386 --> 0:19:18,99
(Bleep) shark.


488
0:19:18,99 --> 0:19:24,429
There he goes.


489
0:19:24,429 --> 0:19:26,197
All right.


490
0:19:26,197 --> 0:19:27,899
Well that was just a plain
old-fashioned kick in the


491
0:19:27,899 --> 0:19:33,504
nuts.


492
0:19:33,504 --> 0:19:36,307
Bill: I heard that Dot
Com hooked up yesterday.


493
0:19:36,307 --> 0:19:38,543
Even with a guy parked on the
spot he still managed to get


494
0:19:38,543 --> 0:19:39,844
a bite.


495
0:19:39,844 --> 0:19:42,46
I'm curious to find out if it
had anything to do with his


496
0:19:42,46 --> 0:19:44,849
fishing gear.


497
0:19:44,849 --> 0:19:45,516
Joe: What's up, Billy?


498
0:19:45,516 --> 0:19:46,317
Bill: Hey, Joe.


499
0:19:46,317 --> 0:19:47,51
Joe: What's happening?


500
0:19:47,51 --> 0:19:48,386
Bill: How's it going buddy?


501
0:19:48,386 --> 0:19:49,2
Good.


502
0:19:49,2 --> 0:19:49,754
Hi, Johnny.


503
0:19:49,754 --> 0:19:50,722
Johnny: What's going on?


504
0:19:50,722 --> 0:19:52,19
So you guys making
any money out there?


505
0:19:52,19 --> 0:19:53,992
Bill: We haven't caught any
fish in a couple of weeks,


506
0:19:53,992 --> 0:19:55,827
and we're really not making
any money right now.


507
0:19:55,827 --> 0:19:57,862
And you know, but the time
you give the crew the money


508
0:19:57,862 --> 0:20:0,598
and you pay the expenses,
there's not much left.


509
0:20:0,598 --> 0:20:1,199
Johnny: Right.


510
0:20:1,199 --> 0:20:1,733
Bill: Really isn't.


511
0:20:1,733 --> 0:20:2,634
Joe: Yeah.


512
0:20:2,634 --> 0:20:4,769
Bill: What, what's
Dot Com buying?


513
0:20:4,769 --> 0:20:6,204
Johnny: Joe, I wouldn't
tell 'em too much.


514
0:20:6,204 --> 0:20:6,671
Joe: Yeah.


515
0:20:6,671 --> 0:20:7,905
Bill: Why not?


516
0:20:7,905 --> 0:20:10,375
Johnny: We can't, we can't
tell you because when people


517
0:20:10,375 --> 0:20:12,81
come in to ask what you're
using I don't tell 'em.


518
0:20:12,81 --> 0:20:13,278
Bill: You don't?


519
0:20:13,278 --> 0:20:13,811
Johnny: No.


520
0:20:13,811 --> 0:20:14,912
Absolutely not.


521
0:20:14,912 --> 0:20:16,914
Bill: You're not gonna
tell me anything, then.


522
0:20:16,914 --> 0:20:17,515
Joe: You get nothing.


523
0:20:17,515 --> 0:20:18,182
Bill: I get nothing.


524
0:20:18,182 --> 0:20:19,951
Joe: You get nothing.


525
0:20:19,951 --> 0:20:21,52
Bill: Tell me the story.


526
0:20:21,52 --> 0:20:21,619
Joe: What?


527
0:20:21,619 --> 0:20:22,487
What story?


528
0:20:22,487 --> 0:20:23,788
There's no stories, Billy.


529
0:20:23,788 --> 0:20:25,256
There's nothing.


530
0:20:25,256 --> 0:20:27,492
Bill: What if we
take you fishing?


531
0:20:27,492 --> 0:20:28,86
Still no story.


532
0:20:28,86 --> 0:20:30,862
Joe: You get nothing.


533
0:20:30,862 --> 0:20:32,196
You get nothing.


534
0:20:32,196 --> 0:20:33,731
Bill: I tried to get some
information from the tackle


535
0:20:33,731 --> 0:20:37,602
store, but they were
completely unhelpful.


536
0:20:37,602 --> 0:20:38,569
Thanks for nothing.


537
0:20:38,569 --> 0:20:39,103
Joe: Yeah.


538
0:20:39,103 --> 0:20:39,837
You're welcome.


539
0:20:39,837 --> 0:20:41,105
Bill: I'll see you later.


540
0:20:41,105 --> 0:20:50,982
Joe: See you.


541
0:20:50,982 --> 0:20:52,85
Dave: We're just getting
here, down to Cape Cod Bay,


542
0:20:52,85 --> 0:20:54,919
there's maybe 20,
25 boats here.


543
0:20:54,919 --> 0:20:56,187
There's gonna be a
lot more after noon,


544
0:20:56,187 --> 0:20:57,922
it's been a late bite, so
this fleet will probably


545
0:20:57,922 --> 0:20:59,9
double in size.


546
0:20:59,9 --> 0:21:0,892
Just looking for a spot to
throw the anchor and get


547
0:21:0,892 --> 0:21:3,528
lines in the water
and sit and wait.


548
0:21:3,528 --> 0:21:6,664
Paul: You could actually get
anywhere by yourself if you


549
0:21:6,664 --> 0:21:8,466
want, on the other side.


550
0:21:8,466 --> 0:21:9,1
Dave: Oh, you want to
drop it right here or


551
0:21:9,1 --> 0:21:10,168
you want to move around?


552
0:21:10,168 --> 0:21:12,637
Paul: We just want a
nice big spot behind us.


553
0:21:12,637 --> 0:21:13,338
Dave: There's gonna be a
million more boats coming,


554
0:21:13,338 --> 0:21:14,672
too.


555
0:21:14,672 --> 0:21:15,373
Where do you wanna go?


556
0:21:15,373 --> 0:21:16,607
Say it now.


557
0:21:16,607 --> 0:21:18,876
Paul: I want to get
away from the boats.


558
0:21:18,876 --> 0:21:20,912
Just go this way a little.


559
0:21:20,912 --> 0:21:25,483
It's so nice being away
from the (bleep) (bleep).


560
0:21:25,483 --> 0:21:27,518
Dave: I got a good
feeling about today.


561
0:21:27,518 --> 0:21:28,152
Paul: Good.


562
0:21:28,152 --> 0:21:29,87
Dave: Nice big fatty.


563
0:21:29,87 --> 0:21:31,189
Paul: Nah, we want
a (bleep) big boy.


564
0:21:31,189 --> 0:21:32,69
Dave: If you want to
catch a world record tuna,


565
0:21:32,69 --> 0:21:33,458
where is it?


566
0:21:33,458 --> 0:21:34,125
Paul: Right here.


567
0:21:34,125 --> 0:21:34,792
Dave: This is the spot.


568
0:21:34,792 --> 0:21:44,402
Paul: This is the spot.


569
0:21:44,402 --> 0:21:47,438
Ralph: Nobody wants to spend
a portion their life on a


570
0:21:47,438 --> 0:21:50,508
boat and not be productive.


571
0:21:50,508 --> 0:21:51,609
We all have families.


572
0:21:51,609 --> 0:21:53,411
We all have bills to pay.


573
0:21:53,411 --> 0:21:55,179
You know, boat insurance.


574
0:21:55,179 --> 0:21:56,981
And, you know, there's so
many things on your mind when


575
0:21:56,981 --> 0:21:58,649
you're sitting
there, you know,


576
0:21:58,649 --> 0:22:2,42
it just manifests to a point
where if you don't gain


577
0:22:2,42 --> 0:22:8,793
control of it, it's
counterproductive.


578
0:22:8,793 --> 0:22:11,529
I want to get nasty
with some tuna fish.


579
0:22:11,529 --> 0:22:13,564
Pirate: Two days solid
fishing, not even a bite.


580
0:22:13,564 --> 0:22:15,666
Ralph: The suffering through
all that (bleep) yesterday,


581
0:22:15,666 --> 0:22:17,402
you would think the man
upstairs would grant us a


582
0:22:17,402 --> 0:22:19,971
fish today.


583
0:22:19,971 --> 0:22:20,872
Oh, marking one.


584
0:22:20,872 --> 0:22:22,874
Fish under the boat, Pirate.


585
0:22:22,874 --> 0:22:23,241
Fish on!


586
0:22:23,241 --> 0:22:26,844
Fish on!


587
0:22:26,844 --> 0:22:29,213
Pirate: I'll take a second.


588
0:22:29,213 --> 0:22:30,815
Ralph: Get the other
line, get the other line!


589
0:22:30,815 --> 0:22:31,783
Pirate: Right now we
got one on the line,


590
0:22:31,783 --> 0:22:35,19
it looks like it's
gonna be a big one.


591
0:22:35,19 --> 0:22:37,655
Ralph: This is what
it's all about.


592
0:22:37,655 --> 0:22:38,689
Ready, Pirate?


593
0:22:38,689 --> 0:22:39,257
Pirate: Yeah.


594
0:22:39,257 --> 0:22:44,796
Ralph: That's it.


595
0:22:44,796 --> 0:22:50,401
I call this dancing
with giants.


596
0:22:50,401 --> 0:22:52,403
He's pulling the boat
backwards right now.


597
0:22:52,403 --> 0:22:55,473
Pirate: And he's doing
a good job of it, too.


598
0:22:55,473 --> 0:22:58,376
He's got head up towards
the bow a little bit now.


599
0:22:58,376 --> 0:23:0,411
Ralph: Nice and
steady, all right?


600
0:23:0,411 --> 0:23:2,68
Don't (bleep) with
his brain too much.


601
0:23:2,68 --> 0:23:4,282
He's coming up,
he's coming up.


602
0:23:4,282 --> 0:23:5,383
Path of least
resistance is up.


603
0:23:5,383 --> 0:23:8,85
That means he's
getting tired.


604
0:23:8,85 --> 0:23:8,953
You need a break?


605
0:23:8,953 --> 0:23:10,922
Pirate: Yeah.


606
0:23:10,922 --> 0:23:12,89
Whoo.


607
0:23:12,89 --> 0:23:13,825
Ralph: Come to papa.


608
0:23:13,825 --> 0:23:17,28
You got a plane
ticket to Japan.


609
0:23:17,28 --> 0:23:19,23
Pirate: As soon as he said
that, I shrugged my head,


610
0:23:19,23 --> 0:23:20,298
don't ever do that.


611
0:23:20,298 --> 0:23:20,998
It's bad karma.


612
0:23:20,998 --> 0:23:31,542
You're gonna jinx yourself.


613
0:23:31,542 --> 0:23:35,146
Ralph: A (bleep) bent rod,
that's what it's all about.


614
0:23:35,146 --> 0:23:40,585
Tight lines and blue gold.


615
0:23:40,585 --> 0:23:46,424
I got a plane ticket
for you, buddy.


616
0:23:46,424 --> 0:23:49,327
Pirate: You want
me to jump back on?


617
0:23:49,327 --> 0:23:50,828
I got it, I got it, I got it.


618
0:23:50,828 --> 0:23:52,463
Should be seeing
color pretty soon.


619
0:23:52,463 --> 0:23:53,531
Ralph: Coming up.


620
0:23:53,531 --> 0:23:54,999
Pirate: I know I
gotcha, I can see.


621
0:23:54,999 --> 0:23:57,1
Ralph: Coming up.


622
0:23:57,1 --> 0:24:2,84
Pirate: Coming
up the elevator.


623
0:24:2,84 --> 0:24:4,408
All of a sudden I see
the line getting closer,


624
0:24:4,408 --> 0:24:6,744
I see the color coming up.


625
0:24:6,744 --> 0:24:11,782
Wow, he's acting
stupid right now.


626
0:24:11,782 --> 0:24:13,951
Oh!


627
0:24:13,951 --> 0:24:16,854
Ralph: It's (bleep) gone!


628
0:24:16,854 --> 0:24:18,55
Pirate: It's just gone!


629
0:24:18,55 --> 0:24:19,257
I don't know what happened.


630
0:24:19,257 --> 0:24:21,926
The line just, it, it
snapped, something.


631
0:24:21,926 --> 0:24:27,498
I don't know.


632
0:24:27,498 --> 0:24:30,468
Ralph: (Bleep) Over the
course of your career,


633
0:24:30,468 --> 0:24:33,37
you know, you know that
they're not dead until


634
0:24:33,37 --> 0:24:34,205
they're in the boat.


635
0:24:34,205 --> 0:24:35,706
Pulled the hook.


636
0:24:35,706 --> 0:24:38,409
Sometimes you just get a
little too cocky, you know?


637
0:24:38,409 --> 0:24:41,279
I mean I was sending that
fish to Japan and he told me,


638
0:24:41,279 --> 0:24:42,446
no, he's not.


639
0:24:42,446 --> 0:24:43,548
He's staying.


640
0:24:43,548 --> 0:24:45,249
And he wound up staying.


641
0:24:45,249 --> 0:24:50,87
I'm miserable.


642
0:24:50,87 --> 0:24:53,24
But it'll go away,
we'll get another one.


643
0:24:53,24 --> 0:24:55,593
Pirate: That guy Dave on
Tuna.com is so lucky.


644
0:24:55,593 --> 0:24:57,194
We're out there struggling,
and he seems to be able to


645
0:24:57,194 --> 0:25:4,669
catch fish every
five minutes.


646
0:25:4,669 --> 0:25:6,237
Dave: Nobody else has
been catching anything.


647
0:25:6,237 --> 0:25:8,205
But I have a feeling
we're gonna score again.


648
0:25:8,205 --> 0:25:11,943
You smell 'em?


649
0:25:11,943 --> 0:25:14,979
Right here.


650
0:25:14,979 --> 0:25:15,58
Paul: Come on, baby.


651
0:25:15,58 --> 0:25:17,48
Make a mistake.


652
0:25:17,48 --> 0:25:20,451
Every single day we go out,
we're looking for multiple


653
0:25:20,451 --> 0:25:24,255
fish, and a nice
quality fish.


654
0:25:24,255 --> 0:25:26,39
And a big fish.


655
0:25:26,39 --> 0:25:27,725
Dave: Oh, man.


656
0:25:27,725 --> 0:25:28,793
My back.


657
0:25:28,793 --> 0:25:31,95
I've got to do it this way.


658
0:25:31,95 --> 0:25:33,264
If I get pulled over, you
guys come and get me?


659
0:25:33,264 --> 0:25:35,132
After you get the fish.


660
0:25:35,132 --> 0:25:36,534
Two there.


661
0:25:36,534 --> 0:25:38,135
Paul: Yeah, two of them.


662
0:25:38,135 --> 0:25:40,304
45 feet.


663
0:25:40,304 --> 0:25:41,439
Everywhere.


664
0:25:41,439 --> 0:25:42,44
They're just wherever the
chum is that's where they


665
0:25:42,44 --> 0:25:43,341
are.


666
0:25:43,341 --> 0:25:44,475
Dave: Yeah, just
zigging and zagging.


667
0:25:44,475 --> 0:25:45,176
Paul: Yeah.


668
0:25:45,176 --> 0:25:45,943
Dave: Still smell 'em.


669
0:25:45,943 --> 0:25:50,915
You guys smell 'em?


670
0:25:50,915 --> 0:25:53,918
Still there.


671
0:25:53,918 --> 0:25:57,622
Holy (bleep)
jumbos right there.


672
0:25:57,622 --> 0:25:58,756
Here we go.


673
0:25:58,756 --> 0:26:2,994
We're on.


674
0:26:2,994 --> 0:26:4,195
Make sure the anchor's
disconnected.


675
0:26:4,195 --> 0:26:4,629
Paul: We're fine.


676
0:26:4,629 --> 0:26:4,996
Dave: Okay.


677
0:26:4,996 --> 0:26:5,463
Let's go.


678
0:26:5,463 --> 0:26:8,866
You can pop.


679
0:26:8,866 --> 0:26:9,667
How's the anchor?


680
0:26:9,667 --> 0:26:10,935
You guys alright
on the anchor?


681
0:26:10,935 --> 0:26:12,36
Paul: We're way away, Dave,
the anchor's (bleep) half a


682
0:26:12,36 --> 0:26:13,17
mile in front of us.


683
0:26:13,17 --> 0:26:16,574
Dave: I'm just checking,
Paul, (bleep) relax.


684
0:26:16,574 --> 0:26:17,775
Forward.


685
0:26:17,775 --> 0:26:20,144
Another 8,000-dollar
fish coming in, baby.


686
0:26:20,144 --> 0:26:21,879
This is what it's all about.


687
0:26:21,879 --> 0:26:23,214
I don't have much more to go.


688
0:26:23,214 --> 0:26:27,385
Good color.


689
0:26:27,385 --> 0:26:30,54
I don't know where Paul is.


690
0:26:30,54 --> 0:26:30,855
We were fighting a fish.


691
0:26:30,855 --> 0:26:31,989
Sandro was the wheelman.


692
0:26:31,989 --> 0:26:34,225
I was on a fish,
and Paul was gone.


693
0:26:34,225 --> 0:26:36,93
I just got to
keep him sliding.


694
0:26:36,93 --> 0:26:38,462
Good color.


695
0:26:38,462 --> 0:26:39,73
You're gonna miss the white.


696
0:26:39,73 --> 0:26:40,765
Paul: Dave!


697
0:26:40,765 --> 0:26:41,666
Dave: What?


698
0:26:41,666 --> 0:26:42,9
Sandro: It's sicko,
he's pooping.


699
0:26:42,9 --> 0:26:45,102
Paul: Yeah, I was taking
a (bleep) on the bucket.


700
0:26:45,102 --> 0:26:46,17
Yeah.


701
0:26:46,17 --> 0:26:47,38
Dave: Hurry up.


702
0:26:47,38 --> 0:26:48,105
I'm gonna have
to, I got color.


703
0:26:48,105 --> 0:26:49,707
The most opportune time
to harpoon the fish,


704
0:26:49,707 --> 0:26:51,142
he's downstairs.


705
0:26:51,142 --> 0:26:52,376
I don't know what
he was doing.


706
0:26:52,376 --> 0:26:53,611
I guess he really had to go.


707
0:26:53,611 --> 0:26:56,113
Paul: I had a bran
muffin and some Wheaties.


708
0:26:56,113 --> 0:26:58,683
So I had to go
to the bathroom.


709
0:26:58,683 --> 0:27:0,151
Dave: You better
pinch that loaf fast.


710
0:27:0,151 --> 0:27:1,252
Paul: Ha, ha.


711
0:27:1,252 --> 0:27:5,489
Ha, ha, ha.


712
0:27:5,489 --> 0:27:7,258
Sandro: Ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha.


713
0:27:7,258 --> 0:27:9,527
Paul: What?


714
0:27:9,527 --> 0:27:11,62
Dave: That's gross!


715
0:27:11,62 --> 0:27:12,296
Sandro: It's gonna cut
right through the poop.


716
0:27:12,296 --> 0:27:15,99
It's gonna cut right
through the poop.


717
0:27:15,99 --> 0:27:16,734
Paul: Aw, you're
touching it right now.


718
0:27:16,734 --> 0:27:18,135
Dave: Oh.


719
0:27:18,135 --> 0:27:19,47
Swivel.


720
0:27:19,47 --> 0:27:20,538
Good color.


721
0:27:20,538 --> 0:27:21,138
Paul, faster!


722
0:27:21,138 --> 0:27:21,706
Bring it around!


723
0:27:21,706 --> 0:27:23,441
Paul: Yeah.


724
0:27:23,441 --> 0:27:24,8
Dave: Go, go, go.


725
0:27:24,8 --> 0:27:25,209
Back, back, back.


726
0:27:25,209 --> 0:27:26,544
Got one.


727
0:27:26,544 --> 0:27:27,178
Good button.


728
0:27:27,178 --> 0:27:28,112
Stay there.


729
0:27:28,112 --> 0:27:30,548
Got neutral,
neutral, neutral.


730
0:27:30,548 --> 0:27:32,249
Get the other gaff.


731
0:27:32,249 --> 0:27:33,284
Other gaff quick.


732
0:27:33,284 --> 0:27:34,18
Paul: Other gaff?


733
0:27:34,18 --> 0:27:38,422
Dave: Quick before he kicks.


734
0:27:38,422 --> 0:27:39,557
Got it.


735
0:27:39,557 --> 0:27:42,126
Paul: Dude, he's got
beautiful shape.


736
0:27:42,126 --> 0:27:44,795
Like the little
fat kid in school.


737
0:27:44,795 --> 0:27:46,897
Come here, you.


738
0:27:46,897 --> 0:27:48,566
He's bigger than we thought.


739
0:27:48,566 --> 0:27:50,568
Dave: That's
(bleep) beautiful.


740
0:27:50,568 --> 0:27:52,136
That's a five,
600-pounder right there.


741
0:27:52,136 --> 0:28:4,482
We're gonna make five, six
grand on that, no problem.


742
0:28:4,482 --> 0:28:6,751
Bill: Ralph.


743
0:28:6,751 --> 0:28:7,651
Can you hear me?


744
0:28:7,651 --> 0:28:8,519
Ralph: Yeah, go ahead.


745
0:28:8,519 --> 0:28:9,153
Bill: Did you hear?


746
0:28:9,153 --> 0:28:11,21
Dot Com hooked up again.


747
0:28:11,21 --> 0:28:12,356
Ralph: Dave's got two?


748
0:28:12,356 --> 0:28:14,425
Ralph: Pretty frustrating to
watch Tuna Dave on the Dot


749
0:28:14,425 --> 0:28:16,66
Com have two fish
this weekend.


750
0:28:16,66 --> 0:28:18,662
And nobody else
is doing anything.


751
0:28:18,662 --> 0:28:20,831
Bill: Tuna.com hooking up
all over the place is really


752
0:28:20,831 --> 0:28:22,566
starting to piss me off.


753
0:28:22,566 --> 0:28:23,567
Ralph: Yeah.


754
0:28:23,567 --> 0:28:24,468
The guy works hard.


755
0:28:24,468 --> 0:28:25,703
We just got to
work harder, Billy.


756
0:28:25,703 --> 0:28:28,572
Dot Com is still finding ways
to catch, so we will too.


757
0:28:28,572 --> 0:28:39,784
Bill: All right.


758
0:28:39,784 --> 0:28:41,418
Ralph: I drive out to a spot
that I've been fishing for


759
0:28:41,418 --> 0:28:47,324
two weeks, and there's some
(bleep) on my numbers.


760
0:28:47,324 --> 0:28:49,226
Pirate: Someone is
sitting on our spot.


761
0:28:49,226 --> 0:28:55,766
Ralph: There's gonna be a
confrontation here right now.


762
0:28:55,766 --> 0:28:57,668
I'm fishing the same set
of numbers for two (bleep)


763
0:28:57,668 --> 0:28:58,736
weeks!


764
0:28:58,736 --> 0:29:0,104
Man: Ralphie, I been
fishing here for a month.


765
0:29:0,104 --> 0:29:0,905
Ralph: (Bleep)!


766
0:29:0,905 --> 0:29:2,306
(Bleep) (bleep)!


767
0:29:2,306 --> 0:29:3,274
(Bleep)!


768
0:29:3,274 --> 0:29:4,175
(Bleep).


769
0:29:4,175 --> 0:29:5,242
Pirate: This is bad.


770
0:29:5,242 --> 0:29:6,577
If you were fishing
in a certain numbers,


771
0:29:6,577 --> 0:29:9,13
you would expect someone else
to respect your numbers.


772
0:29:9,13 --> 0:29:11,515
Ralph: (Bleep) low life,
that's what he is.


773
0:29:11,515 --> 0:29:12,883
Go ahead, put your lines out!


774
0:29:12,883 --> 0:29:14,585
I'm gonna cut 'em all off!


775
0:29:14,585 --> 0:29:15,986
I'm a very vocal guy.


776
0:29:15,986 --> 0:29:17,454
I like to yell and
scream at people.


777
0:29:17,454 --> 0:29:19,857
It's the challenge, it's
the competitiveness,


778
0:29:19,857 --> 0:29:22,359
it's the aggressiveness,
it's the environment.


779
0:29:22,359 --> 0:29:25,896
And when people do that
to me I just lose my mind.


780
0:29:25,896 --> 0:29:28,766
Are you gonna move or
you're not gonna move?


781
0:29:28,766 --> 0:29:30,668
You're not gonna move?


782
0:29:30,668 --> 0:29:32,803
(Bleep).


783
0:29:32,803 --> 0:29:34,71
All right.


784
0:29:34,71 --> 0:29:36,106
Go ahead, put your baits out,
I'll ride right over them.


785
0:29:36,106 --> 0:29:37,708
Pirate: Sometimes we have
some incidents where I think


786
0:29:37,708 --> 0:29:40,44
that the Captain's gonna blow
a head gasket when he gets


787
0:29:40,44 --> 0:29:41,345
that wound up.


788
0:29:41,345 --> 0:29:44,481
Man: Hey, it's time for you
to go back to Georges Bank.


789
0:29:44,481 --> 0:29:58,429
Ralph: I'll see you at
the dock, you (bleep).


790
0:29:58,429 --> 0:30:0,564
Bill: We haven't seen
nothing for a long time.


791
0:30:0,564 --> 0:30:2,867
Scott: You know, it's an
expensive operation to run


792
0:30:2,867 --> 0:30:3,901
that boat.


793
0:30:3,901 --> 0:30:8,973
You know, fuel, bait,
food, slip fees.


794
0:30:8,973 --> 0:30:10,7
These are bills.


795
0:30:10,7 --> 0:30:11,475
These are real time
bills you have to pay.


796
0:30:11,475 --> 0:30:14,945
The stakes are extremely
high for Bill and Donna.


797
0:30:14,945 --> 0:30:17,915
I've heard them say to me,
"If we don't catch some fish,


798
0:30:17,915 --> 0:30:21,886
I'm gonna have to
sell the boat."


799
0:30:21,886 --> 0:30:26,123
Scott: We marking some fish
now at around 100 feet.


800
0:30:26,123 --> 0:30:28,459
Donna has a good
chum slick going.


801
0:30:28,459 --> 0:30:35,32
And I'm gonna put my mackerel
in the middle of it.


802
0:30:35,32 --> 0:30:36,934
Bill: There he is
again, 70 feet.


803
0:30:36,934 --> 0:30:38,502
80 feet.


804
0:30:38,502 --> 0:30:42,573
He ain't leaving.


805
0:30:42,573 --> 0:30:45,509
Donna: We're just praying
that he makes a mistake.


806
0:30:45,509 --> 0:30:46,644
Come on, make a mistake.


807
0:30:46,644 --> 0:30:51,949
Make a mistake.


808
0:30:51,949 --> 0:30:54,184
Bill: Here he comes.


809
0:30:54,184 --> 0:30:56,253
70 feet.


810
0:30:56,253 --> 0:30:57,821
Come on, come back.


811
0:30:57,821 --> 0:30:58,389
Back again.


812
0:30:58,389 --> 0:30:59,823
60 feet.


813
0:30:59,823 --> 0:31:2,92
Come back, come
back, come back.


814
0:31:2,92 --> 0:31:3,26
Oh, right under the boat.


815
0:31:3,26 --> 0:31:4,361
Both screens.


816
0:31:4,361 --> 0:31:6,864
We basically use the
sonar to locate the fish,


817
0:31:6,864 --> 0:31:8,999
and that tells us that
they're under the boat,


818
0:31:8,999 --> 0:31:10,734
and then you have
to go to work.


819
0:31:10,734 --> 0:31:11,969
50 feet.


820
0:31:11,969 --> 0:31:12,569
Big mark.


821
0:31:12,569 --> 0:31:15,205
Oh, real big.


822
0:31:15,205 --> 0:31:15,973
Coming up more.


823
0:31:15,973 --> 0:31:16,84
Coming up higher.


824
0:31:16,84 --> 0:31:18,8
40 feet.


825
0:31:18,8 --> 0:31:25,849
Donna: Come on, you (bleep).


826
0:31:25,849 --> 0:31:26,684
We're on!


827
0:31:26,684 --> 0:31:27,785
We're on!


828
0:31:27,785 --> 0:31:30,354
Scott: Take the (bleep)
thing, don't look at it.


829
0:31:30,354 --> 0:31:36,927
Holy (bleep), hurry up!


830
0:31:36,927 --> 0:31:38,495
Donna: Bring him up, Scott,
come on, bring him up.


831
0:31:38,495 --> 0:31:40,631
Bring him the (bleep) up.


832
0:31:40,631 --> 0:31:42,7
Yeah, baby, we're on.


833
0:31:42,7 --> 0:31:45,869
Bill: Go get him, Scott.


834
0:31:45,869 --> 0:31:47,171
Hey!


835
0:31:47,171 --> 0:31:50,207
Hey!


836
0:31:50,207 --> 0:31:51,208
He's hooked up!


837
0:31:51,208 --> 0:31:53,143
Get the hell out of the way!


838
0:31:53,143 --> 0:31:57,214
Donna: And then the
googans show up.


839
0:31:57,214 --> 0:31:58,782
Bill: Watch that, watch that
(bleep) be in the (bleep) way


840
0:31:58,782 --> 0:32:0,217
now.


841
0:32:0,217 --> 0:32:2,686
These other guys that
come now, they just,


842
0:32:2,686 --> 0:32:3,954
they don't know any better.


843
0:32:3,954 --> 0:32:5,189
It's not even respect.


844
0:32:5,189 --> 0:32:7,57
It's they don't
know any better.


845
0:32:7,57 --> 0:32:8,92
Yeah.


846
0:32:8,92 --> 0:32:10,27
We're going right for
his (bleep) anchor.


847
0:32:10,27 --> 0:32:12,663
Donna: Get the (bleep)
out of the way!


848
0:32:12,663 --> 0:32:13,864
Bill: It's a battle.


849
0:32:13,864 --> 0:32:15,132
It's a battle you have to
deal with and it happens all


850
0:32:15,132 --> 0:32:16,667
the time now.


851
0:32:16,667 --> 0:32:19,636
He's (bleep) my line.


852
0:32:19,636 --> 0:32:21,405
Hey!


853
0:32:21,405 --> 0:32:22,506
Meathead!


854
0:32:22,506 --> 0:32:23,574
Bill: They have no etiquette.


855
0:32:23,574 --> 0:32:24,174
They don't care.


856
0:32:24,174 --> 0:32:24,775
They don't know.


857
0:32:24,775 --> 0:32:25,409
They don't care.


858
0:32:25,409 --> 0:32:26,91
I don't know what it is.


859
0:32:26,91 --> 0:32:27,978
Scott: Look where
his line is.


860
0:32:27,978 --> 0:32:29,546
He's in our (bleep) fish.


861
0:32:29,546 --> 0:32:30,414
Bill: He's hooked up!


862
0:32:30,414 --> 0:32:32,549
Get the (bleep)
out of the way!


863
0:32:32,549 --> 0:32:33,35
Scott: Here it comes, Billy.


864
0:32:33,35 --> 0:32:34,218
Get ready with a knife.


865
0:32:34,218 --> 0:32:36,253
Bill: Oh, the (bleep) hook!


866
0:32:36,253 --> 0:32:38,989
You (bleep) (bleep).


867
0:32:38,989 --> 0:32:40,9
This (bleep) guy.


868
0:32:40,9 --> 0:32:42,359
If we get caught in
his (bleep) anchor,


869
0:32:42,359 --> 0:32:54,171
I'm gonna (bleep)
lose my mind.


870
0:32:54,171 --> 0:32:56,974
Bill: Hey!


871
0:32:56,974 --> 0:32:59,76
Go some other (bleep) place.


872
0:32:59,76 --> 0:33:1,979
Scott: You get this (bleep)
googan who parks right next


873
0:33:1,979 --> 0:33:2,846
to you.


874
0:33:2,846 --> 0:33:4,648
Only bad things can happen.


875
0:33:4,648 --> 0:33:6,316
He runs over our line.


876
0:33:6,316 --> 0:33:7,484
The line's gonna break.


877
0:33:7,484 --> 0:33:10,421
And we're gonna lose tens
of thousands of dollars.


878
0:33:10,421 --> 0:33:11,422
Coming up.


879
0:33:11,422 --> 0:33:14,158
Bill: Get the (bleep)
out of the way!


880
0:33:14,158 --> 0:33:15,392
Scott: You know, I'd like
to scream and yell at this


881
0:33:15,392 --> 0:33:17,928
(bleep), and he doesn't think
he's doing anything wrong


882
0:33:17,928 --> 0:33:20,13
because he has no idea.


883
0:33:20,13 --> 0:33:22,633
'Cause he's, he's a googan.


884
0:33:22,633 --> 0:33:29,773
Bill: You gotta try to stop
him from going down there.


885
0:33:29,773 --> 0:33:30,841
Scott: Forget it.


886
0:33:30,841 --> 0:33:31,408
He's gone.


887
0:33:31,408 --> 0:33:32,843
Bill: Huh?


888
0:33:32,843 --> 0:33:33,977
Donna: (Bleep).


889
0:33:33,977 --> 0:33:35,946
The line broke.


890
0:33:35,946 --> 0:33:37,81
Bill: Are you sure?


891
0:33:37,81 --> 0:33:37,581
Scott: Yeah.


892
0:33:37,581 --> 0:33:38,182
Donna: Yeah.


893
0:33:38,182 --> 0:33:39,416
Scott: I saw it pop.


894
0:33:39,416 --> 0:33:40,884
Bill: The main line broke.


895
0:33:40,884 --> 0:33:43,654
The guy's line got
caught in our line,


896
0:33:43,654 --> 0:33:45,189
chafed the main line.


897
0:33:45,189 --> 0:33:48,92
Eventually the line
popped and we lost him.


898
0:33:48,92 --> 0:33:50,561
And then when we pulled
it in to check it,


899
0:33:50,561 --> 0:33:52,196
the main line was chafed.


900
0:33:52,196 --> 0:33:53,864
And I know where
that came from.


901
0:33:53,864 --> 0:33:56,1
There's no if, ands
or buts about it.


902
0:33:56,1 --> 0:33:59,636
So the guy basically cost
us five or 10,000 dollars.


903
0:33:59,636 --> 0:34:4,475
Well, put it on, put it out.


904
0:34:4,475 --> 0:34:20,39
Scott: What happened
to us, you know.


905
0:34:20,39 --> 0:34:23,6
Bill: It's always been a
battle, but today it's worse.


906
0:34:23,6 --> 0:34:25,329
That's worse
than the weather.


907
0:34:25,329 --> 0:34:27,865
It's worse than the fish.


908
0:34:27,865 --> 0:34:30,501
It's worse than the dogfish.


909
0:34:30,501 --> 0:34:31,935
They don't get it.


910
0:34:31,935 --> 0:34:34,4
It's a sad thing.


911
0:34:34,4 --> 0:34:39,877
Scott: What they don't
realize is the effort.


912
0:34:39,877 --> 0:34:42,346
The effort it takes to reel
one of these things in.


913
0:34:42,346 --> 0:34:49,52
To lose it like
that, that hurts.


914
0:34:49,52 --> 0:34:50,254
Bill: If they allowed
guns out here,


915
0:34:50,254 --> 0:34:57,861
there'd be a lot
of dead people.


916
0:34:57,861 --> 0:34:59,263
Ralph: What happened to you?


917
0:34:59,263 --> 0:35:1,932
Broke a main line and
then you broke a hook?


918
0:35:1,932 --> 0:35:3,4
Bill: The googan
guy in the boat,


919
0:35:3,4 --> 0:35:4,568
thought he was hooked up.


920
0:35:4,568 --> 0:35:7,4
He's tugging on the thing,
and pulling my rod around


921
0:35:7,4 --> 0:35:8,539
while I'm fighting the fish.


922
0:35:8,539 --> 0:35:11,74
And I think that it
chafed the main line.


923
0:35:11,74 --> 0:35:13,343
It is what it is, you know.


924
0:35:13,343 --> 0:35:14,845
It's how my year
has been going.


925
0:35:14,845 --> 0:35:17,381
Ralph: Yeah, it's just you're
on the you're on the bottom


926
0:35:17,381 --> 0:35:18,882
of the turn,
Billy, that's all.


927
0:35:18,882 --> 0:35:20,817
You'll be back on top again.


928
0:35:20,817 --> 0:35:22,986
Takes a while to get
around the curve.


929
0:35:22,986 --> 0:35:24,821
Bill: Yeah, I know.


930
0:35:24,821 --> 0:35:27,791
Ralph: How many times in your
career do you hit the bottom?


931
0:35:27,791 --> 0:35:29,96
Couple.


932
0:35:29,96 --> 0:35:31,28
Bill: Oh, yeah.


933
0:35:31,28 --> 0:35:33,73
And that's the way it
is, buddy, thank you.


934
0:35:33,73 --> 0:35:35,832
Not much I can do about
it, you know what I mean?


935
0:35:35,832 --> 0:35:37,701
Even when I get the
bite, I don't get 'em.


936
0:35:37,701 --> 0:35:42,139
All I know is if I lose a
fish on a googan again today,


937
0:35:42,139 --> 0:35:44,708
ah, I'm going to jail.


938
0:35:44,708 --> 0:35:45,175
Ralph: All right.


939
0:35:45,175 --> 0:35:46,877
Wish 'em up.


940
0:35:46,877 --> 0:35:48,245
Let's go.


941
0:35:48,245 --> 0:35:58,922
Bend the rod.


942
0:35:58,922 --> 0:36:6,296
Marciano: We're wrapping
it up here for the day.


943
0:36:6,296 --> 0:36:12,302
Buh-dee-buh-dee-buh-dee,
that's all folks.


944
0:36:12,302 --> 0:36:15,72
We didn't get nothing today.


945
0:36:15,72 --> 0:36:16,73
You know?


946
0:36:16,73 --> 0:36:17,541
And I tried a little
something different,


947
0:36:17,541 --> 0:36:19,876
I came out here,
we came a long way.


948
0:36:19,876 --> 0:36:23,18
We spent probably close to
200 dollars on fuel today.


949
0:36:23,18 --> 0:36:26,316
Maybe threw another 100 bucks
worth of bait over the side.


950
0:36:26,316 --> 0:36:27,851
And now we came up
empty, you know?


951
0:36:27,851 --> 0:36:30,487
So that's another 300
bucks onto our total.


952
0:36:30,487 --> 0:36:32,99
But it was important that
I try this, you know?


953
0:36:32,99 --> 0:36:35,25
I know Bounty Hunter
didn't get any.


954
0:36:35,25 --> 0:36:36,86
And I know Ralph:
didn't get any today.


955
0:36:36,86 --> 0:36:38,462
But I think it
was a good gamble.


956
0:36:38,462 --> 0:36:40,831
We blew 300 bucks
on a recon trip.


957
0:36:40,831 --> 0:36:42,599
I'm not thrilled with that.


958
0:36:42,599 --> 0:36:51,875
But I'm okay with that.


959
0:36:51,875 --> 0:36:53,577
Dave: You know, we hooked up
and we had a bunch of other


960
0:36:53,577 --> 0:36:54,645
fish under the boat.


961
0:36:54,645 --> 0:36:57,214
Paul: Marking like
a whore right now.


962
0:36:57,214 --> 0:36:58,415
Dave: Sometimes
you could hook two,


963
0:36:58,415 --> 0:36:59,65
you could hook three.


964
0:36:59,65 --> 0:37:1,351
Yeah, you could make 15,000
dollars, boom, boom, boom,


965
0:37:1,351 --> 0:37:3,587
but you really gotta keep
your (bleep) together.


966
0:37:3,587 --> 0:37:5,222
Paul: If you don't pay
attention and you get back on


967
0:37:5,222 --> 0:37:6,923
'em right now.


968
0:37:6,923 --> 0:37:8,158
Dave: Day's over.


969
0:37:8,158 --> 0:37:9,192
Paul: we'll lose him and then
that's it, for the day.


970
0:37:9,192 --> 0:37:13,263
If you don't (bleep)
hustle your balls off,


971
0:37:13,263 --> 0:37:15,499
you're not gonna
catch another one.


972
0:37:15,499 --> 0:37:17,567
Sandro: Watch how
quick we hook up again.


973
0:37:17,567 --> 0:37:20,671
Speed, speed.


974
0:37:20,671 --> 0:37:22,806
Paul: A lot of whole herring
in the water I'm throwing.


975
0:37:22,806 --> 0:37:24,741
Dave: Okay.


976
0:37:24,741 --> 0:37:27,44
Paul: Here he comes, baby.


977
0:37:27,44 --> 0:37:29,513
Here he comes, two of 'em.


978
0:37:29,513 --> 0:37:30,681
60 feet!


979
0:37:30,681 --> 0:37:31,882
70 feet!


980
0:37:31,882 --> 0:37:32,949
Bang!


981
0:37:32,949 --> 0:37:34,217
Dave: Sandro, keep throwing.


982
0:37:34,217 --> 0:37:35,819
You keep doing
your job, buddy.


983
0:37:35,819 --> 0:37:39,56
Paul: Three of 'em!


984
0:37:39,56 --> 0:37:43,794
Whoo!


985
0:37:43,794 --> 0:37:45,796
Dave: Come on, eat
it right there.


986
0:37:45,796 --> 0:37:49,232
I dare you.


987
0:37:49,232 --> 0:37:51,435
Got direct sunlight going
all across the lines,


988
0:37:51,435 --> 0:37:54,404
the glare right off the
line, they see everything.


989
0:37:54,404 --> 0:37:58,275
These fish aren't 1,000
pounds 'cause they're stupid.


990
0:37:58,275 --> 0:37:59,476
They've been
around the block.


991
0:37:59,476 --> 0:38:2,79
They'll come up, look at a
bait and in the last two or


992
0:38:2,79 --> 0:38:5,849
three feet, they'll
just turn away.


993
0:38:5,849 --> 0:38:7,84
Sandro: Oh, they're big boys.


994
0:38:7,84 --> 0:38:8,85
Paul: Was it big?


995
0:38:8,85 --> 0:38:8,685
Was it really?


996
0:38:8,685 --> 0:38:21,164
Sandro: Oh, yeah.


997
0:38:21,164 --> 0:38:22,366
Paul: Yes, (bleep).


998
0:38:22,366 --> 0:38:22,933
Dave: There he is.


999
0:38:22,933 --> 0:38:23,4
We got him.


1000
0:38:23,4 --> 0:38:23,867
We got him.


1001
0:38:23,867 --> 0:38:24,401
Throw it up.


1002
0:38:24,401 --> 0:38:24,935
Paul: Go, baby.


1003
0:38:24,935 --> 0:38:25,902
Dave: Go, go, go.


1004
0:38:25,902 --> 0:38:26,903
Paul: Oh, yeah, let's
go forward there.


1005
0:38:26,903 --> 0:38:28,405
Paul: Hold on, you're
good, you're good.


1006
0:38:28,405 --> 0:38:30,374
He's going around here.


1007
0:38:30,374 --> 0:38:31,875
He's pissed.


1008
0:38:31,875 --> 0:38:33,243
Dave: We're on.


1009
0:38:33,243 --> 0:38:36,446
Again.


1010
0:38:36,446 --> 0:38:37,13
Forward, left.


1011
0:38:37,13 --> 0:38:37,881
Forward left fast.


1012
0:38:37,881 --> 0:38:39,349
Fast, go!


1013
0:38:39,349 --> 0:38:40,684
The other way, all
right, all right.


1014
0:38:40,684 --> 0:38:42,219
That a way.


1015
0:38:42,219 --> 0:38:43,387
Paul: We're on.


1016
0:38:43,387 --> 0:38:46,39
Yeah, let him, let
him do his thing.


1017
0:38:46,39 --> 0:38:50,527
Hopefully we'll get to
use this right here.


1018
0:38:50,527 --> 0:38:53,497
You never can tell.


1019
0:38:53,497 --> 0:38:54,297
Sandro: Anything can happen.


1020
0:38:54,297 --> 0:38:55,732
Not just (bleep).


1021
0:38:55,732 --> 0:38:56,767
Paul: Yeah.


1022
0:38:56,767 --> 0:38:58,668
Actually, the first
one, (bleep) happened.


1023
0:38:58,668 --> 0:39:0,937
Sandro: Yeah,
(bleep) has happened.


1024
0:39:0,937 --> 0:39:7,1
Dave: Very close.


1025
0:39:7,1 --> 0:39:11,348
Neutral!


1026
0:39:11,348 --> 0:39:11,882
Gonna get a shot.


1027
0:39:11,882 --> 0:39:13,316
Forward, forward.


1028
0:39:13,316 --> 0:39:15,619
Reverse, reverse,
hard reverse.


1029
0:39:15,619 --> 0:39:16,386
Neutral.


1030
0:39:16,386 --> 0:39:17,12
Good job, good job, good job.


1031
0:39:17,12 --> 0:39:17,888
Neutral.


1032
0:39:17,888 --> 0:39:19,389
Paul: Keep going, keep going.


1033
0:39:19,389 --> 0:39:19,923
Dave: Do the.


1034
0:39:19,923 --> 0:39:20,824
Paul: Turn him.


1035
0:39:20,824 --> 0:39:22,692
Dave: You're okay.


1036
0:39:22,692 --> 0:39:23,627
Paul: Alright.


1037
0:39:23,627 --> 0:39:26,396
Dave: Hard reverse,
hard reverse.


1038
0:39:26,396 --> 0:39:27,164
Paul: Go forward.


1039
0:39:27,164 --> 0:39:28,632
Dave: Don't miss!


1040
0:39:28,632 --> 0:39:30,0
Paul: Oh, I (bleep) missed!


1041
0:39:30,0 --> 0:39:40,877
Dave: You gotta
be (bleep) me.


1042
0:39:40,877 --> 0:39:42,946
Paul: Can't throw at
the mono or I'll cut it.


1043
0:39:42,946 --> 0:39:43,713
Dave: Forward, forward,
come on, forward Right.


1044
0:39:43,713 --> 0:39:44,514
Forward right, Sandro!


1045
0:39:44,514 --> 0:39:45,615
Come on!


1046
0:39:45,615 --> 0:39:46,249
Sandro: (Bleep) bring
the wheel around, Dave.


1047
0:39:46,249 --> 0:39:47,83
Easy.


1048
0:39:47,83 --> 0:39:47,717
Relax.


1049
0:39:47,717 --> 0:39:48,985
Paul: Take it easy.


1050
0:39:48,985 --> 0:39:51,54
Relax.


1051
0:39:51,54 --> 0:39:52,389
Dave: Get ready
to throw here.


1052
0:39:52,389 --> 0:39:53,79
Same as before.


1053
0:39:53,79 --> 0:39:56,86
Paul: Go forward, Sandro.


1054
0:39:56,86 --> 0:39:59,29
Now back up.


1055
0:39:59,29 --> 0:39:59,663
Got him!


1056
0:39:59,663 --> 0:40:0,43
Right in the back!


1057
0:40:0,43 --> 0:40:0,964
Dave: Go!


1058
0:40:0,964 --> 0:40:1,498
Forward, forward!


1059
0:40:1,498 --> 0:40:2,599
Forward, forward!


1060
0:40:2,599 --> 0:40:5,669
Paul: The (bleep) fish
was like forty feet away.


1061
0:40:5,669 --> 0:40:8,939
I (bleep) launched
it and nailed him!


1062
0:40:8,939 --> 0:40:11,608
Phoosh!


1063
0:40:11,608 --> 0:40:16,947
Paul: Got him
right in the back!


1064
0:40:16,947 --> 0:40:18,315
That's good, that's good.


1065
0:40:18,315 --> 0:40:19,216
You did good, Sandro.


1066
0:40:19,216 --> 0:40:20,917
Dave: Yeah, you did well.


1067
0:40:20,917 --> 0:40:24,855
Got one.


1068
0:40:24,855 --> 0:40:26,356
There we go.


1069
0:40:26,356 --> 0:40:28,291
Go ahead.


1070
0:40:28,291 --> 0:40:29,893
That was the best feeling
in the world there,


1071
0:40:29,893 --> 0:40:31,561
catching two big slobs.


1072
0:40:31,561 --> 0:40:32,896
That's a lot of fish.


1073
0:40:32,896 --> 0:40:34,764
Paul: He is big (bleep), huh?


1074
0:40:34,764 --> 0:40:42,239
Dave: Mm-hmm.


1075
0:40:42,239 --> 0:40:43,773
Yeah, this fish is gonna
weigh between eight,


1076
0:40:43,773 --> 0:40:44,641
900 pounds.


1077
0:40:44,641 --> 0:40:48,245
We get nine grand
for this fish.


1078
0:40:48,245 --> 0:40:50,847
Thank you for the paycheck.


1079
0:40:50,847 --> 0:40:53,683
Paul: Aren't they so
(bleep) beautiful though?


1080
0:40:53,683 --> 0:40:55,418
Look how gorgeous they are.


1081
0:40:55,418 --> 0:40:57,12
Dave: Amazing.


1082
0:40:57,12 --> 0:41:1,24
I studied fluid dynamics, and
if you look at this fish,


1083
0:41:1,24 --> 0:41:4,494
and look at a raindrop
falling out of the sky,


1084
0:41:4,494 --> 0:41:6,29
they'd look exactly alike.


1085
0:41:6,29 --> 0:41:9,266
Perfectly hydro-dynamically
designed.


1086
0:41:9,266 --> 0:41:11,535
Even the eyeball is
perfectly smooth.


1087
0:41:11,535 --> 0:41:12,202
Nothing.


1088
0:41:12,202 --> 0:41:13,637
Not a bump, nothing.


1089
0:41:13,637 --> 0:41:16,106
Second fastest
fish in the world.


1090
0:41:16,106 --> 0:41:18,708
Put him to bed.


1091
0:41:18,708 --> 0:41:20,51
Paul: The boat's
got a big fish hole.


1092
0:41:20,51 --> 0:41:22,979
This one was way too
big to put down there,


1093
0:41:22,979 --> 0:41:26,149
so we left it on
top of the deck.


1094
0:41:26,149 --> 0:41:28,84
It was like over
11 feet long.


1095
0:41:28,84 --> 0:41:30,353
So what we did, we had
this big packing bag,


1096
0:41:30,353 --> 0:41:32,923
that's what they ship
the tunas to Japan in,


1097
0:41:32,923 --> 0:41:34,357
in the coffin.


1098
0:41:34,357 --> 0:41:36,459
Just (bleep) burrito
him, and fill 'em.


1099
0:41:36,459 --> 0:41:37,193
Done.


1100
0:41:37,193 --> 0:41:38,795
We pack it with ice.


1101
0:41:38,795 --> 0:41:39,896
Oh, yeah.


1102
0:41:39,896 --> 0:41:43,99
(Bleep) ice cubes coming
out of his mouth, dude.


1103
0:41:43,99 --> 0:41:44,34
Dave: See 'ya.


1104
0:41:44,34 --> 0:41:45,68
Paul: Ha ha.


1105
0:41:45,68 --> 0:41:46,369
All right!


1106
0:41:46,369 --> 0:41:47,137
Yeah.


1107
0:41:47,137 --> 0:41:54,477
Dave: Yeah, bitch.


1108
0:41:54,477 --> 0:41:57,747
Ralph: You know nobody likes
to go fishing everyday and


1109
0:41:57,747 --> 0:41:59,516
not catch anything, you know?


1110
0:41:59,516 --> 0:42:1,585
You know, mates get on
the boat to make money.


1111
0:42:1,585 --> 0:42:4,921
If they don't make money,
they don't get paid and


1112
0:42:4,921 --> 0:42:6,289
they're not happy.


1113
0:42:6,289 --> 0:42:8,458
Captain's not happy 'cause
I keep dishing out a couple


1114
0:42:8,458 --> 0:42:10,894
hundred dollars to leave
the dock every day.


1115
0:42:10,894 --> 0:42:13,96
It was a good day on the
bite category but bad on the


1116
0:42:13,96 --> 0:42:15,398
killing category.


1117
0:42:15,398 --> 0:42:17,467
We didn't kill anything.


1118
0:42:17,467 --> 0:42:19,569
Tomorrow may be another day.


1119
0:42:19,569 --> 0:42:21,137
Maybe we'll get him tomorrow.


1120
0:42:21,137 --> 0:42:23,173
Maybe not.


1121
0:42:23,173 --> 0:42:42,192
You never know how these
losing streaks go.


1122
0:42:42,192 --> 0:42:44,6
Bill: Lowman bridge
Bounty Hunter.


1123
0:42:44,6 --> 0:42:45,762
Man: Come back.


1124
0:42:45,762 --> 0:42:47,664
Bill: Good afternoon
captain, Bounty Hunter,


1125
0:42:47,664 --> 0:42:53,69
on the harbor side,
whenever you get a chance.


1126
0:42:53,69 --> 0:42:55,705
Thank you very much.


1127
0:42:55,705 --> 0:42:57,173
We didn't catch (bleep).


1128
0:42:57,173 --> 0:43:0,1
We lost a giant to a googan.


1129
0:43:0,1 --> 0:43:3,947
And Tuna.com caught everyone
that swam by his boat.


1130
0:43:3,947 --> 0:43:6,116
All I want is for
somebody to beat that guy,


1131
0:43:6,116 --> 0:43:19,95
and I don't even
care if it's me.


1132
0:43:19,95 --> 0:43:25,35
Dave: Where do you want it?


1133
0:43:25,35 --> 0:43:26,536
Yeah, I'm getting ready to
meet with the buyers right


1134
0:43:26,536 --> 0:43:27,604
now.


1135
0:43:27,604 --> 0:43:29,873
We got two jumbos on
the boat, and I'm just,


1136
0:43:29,873 --> 0:43:33,71
I'm excited to see
how much they weigh.


1137
0:43:33,71 --> 0:43:35,812
Man: Good, here we go.


1138
0:43:35,812 --> 0:43:38,481
Up we go.


1139
0:43:38,481 --> 0:43:41,251
Dave, I think you're
gonna wear out my winch,


1140
0:43:41,251 --> 0:43:44,22
keep pulling in
all these big ones.


1141
0:43:44,22 --> 0:43:46,556
Yeah, look at the
strain on that.


1142
0:43:46,556 --> 0:43:50,794
That's when you
know it's a fat one.


1143
0:43:50,794 --> 0:43:53,797
Uh-oh.


1144
0:43:53,797 --> 0:43:55,498
You might have to
take the head off.


1145
0:43:55,498 --> 0:43:58,668
Oh no.


1146
0:43:58,668 --> 0:44:0,7
That's as high
as she goes up.


1147
0:44:0,7 --> 0:44:1,204
Paul: Yeah, just
bring him down,


1148
0:44:1,204 --> 0:44:1,905
I'll cut it right there.


1149
0:44:1,905 --> 0:44:3,373
Man: Yeah, Yeah.


1150
0:44:3,373 --> 0:44:5,575
Dave: That's a
pretty fish, though.


1151
0:44:5,575 --> 0:44:8,411
Get one with me
and Paul up there.


1152
0:44:8,411 --> 0:44:9,479
Paul: Get us right in there.


1153
0:44:9,479 --> 0:44:10,146
Sandro: Yep.


1154
0:44:10,146 --> 0:44:11,815
Paul: Pull that fin down.


1155
0:44:11,815 --> 0:44:12,649
Will it come out?


1156
0:44:12,649 --> 0:44:14,818
Yeah.


1157
0:44:14,818 --> 0:44:18,154
Dave: This is probably a
10, 12, 13,000-dollar day.


1158
0:44:18,154 --> 0:44:19,289
So, yeah, awesome day.


1159
0:44:19,289 --> 0:44:21,291
Doesn't get any
better than that.


1160
0:44:21,291 --> 0:44:23,259
Paul: Yeah.


1161
0:44:23,259 --> 0:44:25,61
Wait 'til you see
the ones I got.


1162
0:44:25,61 --> 0:44:26,596
Dave: I mean we fished
fishing close again.


1163
0:44:26,596 --> 0:44:30,366
Expenses are
absolutely nothing.


1164
0:44:30,366 --> 0:44:33,269
Two or three hundred
dollars a day at best.


1165
0:44:33,269 --> 0:44:35,839
Do you know how much money
we're gonna make this year?


1166
0:44:35,839 --> 0:46:35,839
A lot.
