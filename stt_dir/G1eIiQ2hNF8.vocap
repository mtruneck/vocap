###2 Cookies and milk--
###4 that's a pretty good combination.
###8 There's a lot of science in cookies.
###11 There's a lot of science in this chipotle sauce, probably.
###13 But that we're not talking about.
###15 We're talking about the science of milk today.
###18 And there's some really, really cool, believe it or
###19 not, colorful science of milk.
###22 Watch this.
###24 I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all about making science fun.
###27 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###30 ordinary science experiments into unforgetable learning
###33 experiences.
###34 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###37 affect the way people think about science.
###40 And to do that, I live by one motto--
###42 make it big, do it right, give it class.
###45 
###50 Watch this.
###51 
###54 See this amazing burst of color that's here?
###57 In order to understand how milk does this, you have to
###60 understand something about the chemistry of fat, the
###63 chemistry of water, polar, nonpolar, hydrophilic,
###67 hydrophobic--
###68 most importantly, the chemistry of this amazing
###70 substance called soap.
###72 Well, if you take a look at the science of milk, it's
###74 really a combination of fat and water, right?
###77 And all different kinds of fat-- so that's
###79 fat free or 1% 2%.
###81 If we're going to understand how this burst took place,
###83 let's just break this component down and start with
###85 the water component itself.
###87 So in a plate goes just a little bit of water.
###91 And to the water, we add just a couple drops of food
###93 coloring so that we can see the movement--
###96 so a couple drops around the circle.
###99 And now, the last step is just a little bit of soap.
###101 We're just using regular dish soap here.
###103 And I don't need a tremendous amount so I have a little
###106 portion cup.
###107 And our soap is perfect.
###108 Now, in order to dispense it, I'm just using a cotton swab.
###111 So a little bit of the soap on the cotton swab, and now,
###116 watch what happens.
###117 You have to look here in the very middle.
###118 Watch.
###120 Did you see little burst of color that was there?
###122 That's it.
###123 That's our burst.
###125 It's very different from the milk that we had before.
###128 See, the milk had this churning kind of action.
###130 This does actually nothing except for that initial burst,
###134 which means that the soap helped to break up the surface
###137 tension of the water-- that layer of the water that the
###140 molecules hook together.
###141 So the hydrogen bonding allows the water to form almost a
###145 skin, so to speak.
###146 And the soap, of course, breaks that skin and breaks
###149 the surface tension.
###150 But we don't get the bursting.
###152 So it really is not a phenomenon of soap and just
###157 water here and food coloring.
###159 There has to be something with the fat.
###161 See, milk is really a combination of polar and
###164 nonpolar materials.
###165 Polar would be water.
###166 Nonpolar would be the fat.
###167 Now, they say that there's fat, also called lipids.
###171 Maybe The best way to explain what nonpolar would be is to
###174 use this model of these little yellow sticks.
###178 They're called lipids.
###179 See, they're nonpolar in that they're just these long chains
###182 of molecules, so to speak.
###184 See, fat is nothing more than a combination of hydrogen
###187 molecules hooked onto carbon.
###189 And this long chain makes the fat.
###191 See, there's no head and there's no tail.
###193 It's just this long chain.
###195 And this is what we're going to use to represent the fat.
###199 Soap, on the other hand, is a combination
###201 of polar and nonpolar.
###202 And that's why we're using these matches to
###204 represent the soap.
###206 Look at this.
###207 The base of the match here, or the long part, is going to be
###210 used to represent the nonpolar part, very similar to this
###214 part that you see over here with the fat.
###216 But see the very end of the match?
###218 That's the head.
###219 And let's call that the polar part.
###221 Now, water is a polar material.
###223 It's a polar solvent.
###224 So water now dissolves in the head of the match.
###229 And the rest of that match there now wants to attach to
###232 something that it's like.
###233 You've heard the thing "like dissolves like." Well, it
###236 wants to go attach itself to anything
###238 else that is nonpolar.
###241 Look and see how it attaches to the fat.
###243 It's a matter of just matching this up.
###246 The other part, which is the polar part, the head, now
###250 washes away in the polar solvent, which is water.
###254 That's a lot of chemistry to simply say that this is how
###256 you get clean, but this is exactly how they made soap
###259 many, many, many years ago.
###260 They took white wood ash, very alkaline, or
###264 they could take lye.
###265 They would combine that with a little bit of water and then
###267 add and animal fat to that, a little bit of salt, mix the
###270 whole thing together, and it made for this perfect material
###273 that would literally cover your body, remove the grease
###276 and the dirt, and then wash away in the water.
###279 But some of you need an even more scientific explanation of
###282 this hydrophobic, hydrophilic, polar, nonpolar.
###284 And for that, we turn to our friends at Crash Course!, who
###288 know exactly what to say.
###289 HANK GREEN: The fact that water is a polar molecule also
###291 makes it really good at dissolving things, which we
###293 call-- it's a good solvent, then.
###295 Scratch that.
###295 Water isn't a good solvent.
###297 It's an amazing solvent.
###298 There are more substances that can be dissolved in water than
###301 in any other liquid on Earth.
###302 And yes, that includes the strongest acid that we have
###305 ever created.
###306 These substances that dissolve in water--
###308 sugar or salt being ones that we're familiar with-- are
###311 called hydrophilic.
###313 And they are hydrophilic because they are polar.
###315 And their polarity is stronger than the cohesive
###318 forces of the water.
###319 So when you get one of these polar substances in water,
###321 it's strong enough that it breaks all the little cohesive
###324 forces, all those little hydrogen bonds.
###326 And instead of hydrogen bonding to each other, the
###328 water will hydrogen bond around these polar substances.
###331 Table salt is ionic.
###333 And right now, it's being separated into ions as the
###336 poles of our water molecules interact with it.
###338 But what happens when there is a molecule that cannot break
###342 the cohesive forces of water?
###344 It can't penetrate and come into it.
###348 Basically, what happens when that substance can't overcome
###350 the strong cohesive forces of water-- it can't get inside of
###353 the water-- that's when we get what we call a hydrophobic
###357 substance, or something that is fearful of water.
###360 These molecules lack charged poles.
###362 They are nonpolar and are not dissolving in water, because
###365 essentially, they're being pushed out of the water by
###367 water's cohesive forces.
###369 Water--
###369 we may call it the universal solvent, but that does not
###372 mean that it dissolves everything.
###373 STEVE SPANGLER: So you get this hydrophobic, hydrophilic
###375 thing, right?
###376 Fat being hydrophobic, correct, and the hydrophobic
###380 end of the soap, and then the head of the match being
###383 hydrophilic, or water-loving--
###385 that's the part that just simply washes away.
###388 What does all this have to do with bursting milk?
###390 Well, now you start to see the alignment of the molecules
###393 that take place in milk.
###394 Well, we're back to the milk.
###396 I selected milk for this example that has a lot of fat.
###399 It's whole milk--
###401 lots of fat.
###402 Of course, there's water.
###403 So if you can imagine this on a microscopic level, as soon
###406 as I tough it, you now have the hydrophobic end-- that's
###409 the long end of the soap--
###411 now trying to hook on to the hydrophobic end of the milk.
###413 And this moving around these tails--
###416 kind of whipping around-- is exactly what you see as the
###418 milk starts to move.
###419 Watch.
###421 See, it's the hydrophobic end.
###423 It's the hydrophobic end of the soap now hooking onto the
###426 hydrophobic end of the milk.
###429 And you can see the movement that's in there.
###431 Literally, we're seeing molecules in motion as the
###434 milk starts to move around, and of course, realigning
###437 itself so that the hydrophilic, or the
###440 water-loving end is close to that of the
###443 water as it moves around.
###444 And you now get to see this beautiful movement inside just
###448 because the molecules are chasing themselves around and
###451 realigning.
###452 So we're going to turn this into a real science
###454 experiment.
###454 It means we have to compare something.
###456 And why not compare the different kinds of milk?
###458 So look over here-- fat free milk, 1%, 2%, whole milk, half
###463 and half, and finally, buttermilk.
###466 Now, it's really important as you're doing your comparison
###469 to make sure that all of the milk is the same temperature.
###471 So we've let all of this sit out at room temperature so
###475 that we're comparing this.
###476 The real question would be does it change at all if you
###478 heat it up or if you get it colder?
###481 Different question at a different time.
###482 Right now, we're simply observing the differences in
###485 fat for all of the milk.
###487 And finally, every great science experiment has to have
###490 a great hypothesis.
###491 So our hypothesis today has to be which one
###493 will burst the best?
###494 The one with the most fat or the one with the least fat?
###497 Lock it in and watch this.
###499 Let's start with fat free.
###501 Watch.
###502 
###508 1%.
###509 
###511 Wow, we get a great burst on 1%.
###513 
###516 All right, 2%.
###518 Here we go.
###520 Wow, even better.
###523 Here's whole milk.
###524 
###529 Beautiful.
###530 Table cream--
###532 lots of fat in table cream.
###533 Watch.
###534 
###537 Look at this continued churning.
###541 And finally, who doesn't like a little buttermilk?
###543 You know, it leaves that kind of feeling in your throat.
###546 I know some of you have already tuned out.
###548 Watch.
###549 
###552 Nothing.
###553 Well, outside the buttermilk, which was just too viscous to
###556 move around, the one with the most amount of fat is the one
###559 that gives us the best bursting, although, if you
###561 take a look at each one of these, you do see some
###563 movement, but it decreases as you go from whole milk, 2%,
###567 1%, and just very, very little movement at all with
###570 the fat free milk.
###571 What a cool way to understand the science of polar and
###574 nonpolar, hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and the science
###577 of soap using something simple like milk.
###579 Well, it looks like milk, but it's not.
###583 It's Elmer's Glue.
###584 See, Elmer's Glue, chemically speaking,
###586 is polyvinyl acetate.
###588 It's a thermoplastic polymer.
###590 It is unusual because it has a polar part that
###593 dissolves in water.
###594 But it also has a nonpolar component.
###597 And you know what we can do if we have something that has a
###599 polar and nonpolar component.
###602 Get the food coloring.
###603 All right.
###604 This one here-- let's start with a little bit of Elmer's
###606 Glue and even less water.
###610 
###613 Now, if I was doing this for science project, I would
###615 measure this out so I could call it a 90% solution of glue
###620 or an 80%, whatever it is.
###622 Here, I just want to test the hypothesis that if we add some
###624 water, that it's going to give us some pretty good bursting
###629 of those colors.
###631 Watch what happens.
###632 
###637 There's the movement that we wanted.
###638 Look at this.
###640 It's fantastic.
###642 You almost get this combination of what we saw
###645 with the buttermilk.
###645 Ah, look at the little fingers that are kind
###647 of coming out here.
###648 Yet you get more movement than we saw with just the regular
###652 Elmer's Glue.
###653 Maybe the best part of this is what happens
###656 when you let it dry.
###657 See, normally, you would just dump the milk out.
###659 But if you allow the Elmer's Glue to dry, especially on
###661 these plastic plates, you get something very cool.
###664 Remember, it's not milk.
###665 All of these plates have Elmer's Glue.
###667 The only difference is the amount of water that
###669 we put in each one.
###670 And the best part is, over time, they'll dry.
###673 Well, if there's not too much water, they'll dry.
###676 And watch what happens when they dry.
###677 You can literally just peel them out.
###681 And it looks like this.
###684 Put them under the flashlight and take a look at this.
###686 You get this beautiful kind of stained glass window effect.
###689 Well, you have some fairly simple materials to learn some
###692 high level chemistry.
###693 And if you use the Elmer's Glue solution, you get a
###697 keepsake that's pretty awesome as well.
###699 And best of all, at the end of day, you've got a whole lot of
###702 milk and some cookies left over.
###705 Who doesn't like a little treat?
###708 Oh, god.
###711 That's glue.
###712 Higginsworth!
###714 God, that's horrible.
###716 
###730 HIGGINSWORTH: Close the door.
###731 Stop wasting energy.
