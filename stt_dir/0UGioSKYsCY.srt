HAMILTON MORRIS: The next day,
I go to visit Max Beauvoir, a


5
0:0:27,76 --> 0:0:30,685
man considered the voice
of the vodou community.


6
0:0:30,685 --> 0:0:39,38



7
0:0:39,38 --> 0:0:42,78
During Wade Davis' stay in
Port-au-Prince, Beauvoir


8
0:0:42,78 --> 0:0:46,54
served as his guide
and mentor.


9
0:0:46,54 --> 0:0:49,89
But in the years since, he's
become the Supreme Chief of


10
0:0:49,89 --> 0:0:55,7

0:0:56,195 --> 0:0:56,69
HAMILTON MORRIS: Hello.

MAX BEAUVOIR: [SPEAKING CREOLE]


14
0:0:57,66 --> 0:0:58,63

15
0:0:58,63 --> 0:0:59,1
HAMILTON MORRIS: Hamilton.


16
0:0:59,1 --> 0:0:59,17
Good.


17
0:0:59,17 --> 0:0:59,55
How are you?


18
0:0:59,55 --> 0:0:59,88
MAX BEAUVOIR: Very good.


19
0:0:59,88 --> 0:1:0,39
Glad to see you.


20
0:1:0,39 --> 0:1:3,46
Hello, please come on in.


21
0:1:3,46 --> 0:1:4,75
HAMILTON MORRIS: Beauvoir
started


22
0:1:4,75 --> 0:1:6,326
his career as a scientist.


23
0:1:6,326 --> 0:1:8,71
MAX BEAUVOIR: Do not be
afraid of my dog.


24
0:1:8,71 --> 0:1:11,7
HAMILTON MORRIS: Receiving a
degree in biochemistry from


25
0:1:11,7 --> 0:1:14,48
the Sorbonne, and went on to
investigate the medicinal


26
0:1:14,48 --> 0:1:18,11
plants of Haiti, patenting a
method to isolate cortisone


27
0:1:18,11 --> 0:1:21,3
precursors from agave.


28
0:1:21,3 --> 0:1:23,96
Though he once straddled the
material world of chemistry


29
0:1:23,96 --> 0:1:27,7
and the metaphysics of vodou,
Beauvoir has abandoned his lab


30
0:1:27,7 --> 0:1:31,265
in favor of the temple in his
own home, called Le Peristyle


31
0:1:31,265 --> 0:1:32,707
de Mariani.

[DRUMMING]


33
0:1:37,816 --> 0:1:40,63



34
0:1:40,63 --> 0:1:42,403
MAX BEAUVOIR: The Westerner
is an arrogant person, by


35
0:1:42,403 --> 0:1:43,99
definition.


36
0:1:43,99 --> 0:1:46,96
And in his arrogance, he
believes he can put his hands


37
0:1:46,96 --> 0:1:50,75
on whatever he wants and possess
whatever he wants,


38
0:1:50,75 --> 0:1:53,25
including soul, including
people.


39
0:1:53,25 --> 0:1:54,79
This is why he made slavery.


40
0:1:54,79 --> 0:1:57,13
This is why he made
so many things.


41
0:1:57,13 --> 0:2:2,3
Being a zombie is not something
physical that


42
0:2:2,3 --> 0:2:3,22
happened to you.


43
0:2:3,22 --> 0:2:5,55
It is something spiritual.


44
0:2:5,55 --> 0:2:9,84
A zombie is somebody
who has misbehaved.


45
0:2:9,84 --> 0:2:11,81
In fact, somebody that in any
other society they would call


46
0:2:11,81 --> 0:2:12,76
a criminal.


47
0:2:12,76 --> 0:2:16,59
Most likely, in other societies,
this person would


48
0:2:16,59 --> 0:2:20,12
have been condemned to death.


49
0:2:20,12 --> 0:2:23,36
Our society, like every society,
has decided that


50
0:2:23,36 --> 0:2:27,21
certain crimes are
intolerable.


51
0:2:27,21 --> 0:2:30,69
Vodou doesn't believe
in killing people.


52
0:2:30,69 --> 0:2:33,78
So in fact, this is why even
that person considered a


53
0:2:33,78 --> 0:2:36,4
criminal is not killed.


54
0:2:36,4 --> 0:2:38,59



55
0:2:38,59 --> 0:2:43,25
We move from him, or from
her, that desire of


56
0:2:43,25 --> 0:2:46,21
committing bad deeds.


57
0:2:46,21 --> 0:2:49,322
And this is what zombification
is all about.


58
0:2:49,322 --> 0:2:54,102



59
0:2:54,102 --> 0:2:57,3
HAMILTON MORRIS: Max Beauvoir's
explanation of


60
0:2:57,3 --> 0:3:1,32
zombification is unlike any
other I've heard thus far.


61
0:3:1,32 --> 0:3:4,33
What he describes sounds
strikingly similar to the use


62
0:3:4,33 --> 0:3:7,55
of antipsychotic drugs
in Western medicine.


63
0:3:7,55 --> 0:3:11,6
But unlike pharmaceutical
antipsychotics, the knowledge


64
0:3:11,6 --> 0:3:14,46
of the poison used to perform
this sort of chemical lobotomy


65
0:3:14,46 --> 0:3:17,57
is controlled by an ancient
secret society


66
0:3:17,57 --> 0:3:20,9
known as the Bizango.


67
0:3:20,9 --> 0:3:23,246
MAX BEAUVOIR: Bizango and also
Sanpwel maintain social


68
0:3:23,246 --> 0:3:28,5
justice, maintain police and
order in our society.


69
0:3:28,5 --> 0:3:31,27
HAMILTON MORRIS: So how would we
go about meeting people in


70
0:3:31,27 --> 0:3:32,0
these societies?


71
0:3:32,0 --> 0:3:34,83
If a foreigner wanted to go and
learn about it, how would


72
0:3:34,83 --> 0:3:36,28
they do that?


73
0:3:36,28 --> 0:3:38,36
MAX BEAUVOIR: I am the
head of the Bizangos.


74
0:3:38,36 --> 0:3:39,61
HAMILTON MORRIS: Yes.


75
0:3:39,61 --> 0:3:47,575



76
0:3:47,575 --> 0:3:52,6
Beauvoir suggests I travel to
the mountains to find rural


77
0:3:52,6 --> 0:3:55,43
members of the Bizango
society, who might be


78
0:3:55,43 --> 0:3:58,32
intimately acquainted with
the secret powder.


79
0:3:58,32 --> 0:4:3,435



80
0:4:3,435 --> 0:4:7,22
WADE DAVIS: All the time that
I was working, both securing


81
0:4:7,22 --> 0:4:10,46
the powders in various locations
and trying to


82
0:4:10,46 --> 0:4:13,69
understand what the nature of
the zombie was, and so on and


83
0:4:13,69 --> 0:4:18,88
so forth, I kept brushing up
against what I later came to


84
0:4:18,88 --> 0:4:21,18
understand to be the secret
societies of Haiti, the


85
0:4:21,18 --> 0:4:23,46
Bizango Champwell, and that
Narcisse had actually been


86
0:4:23,46 --> 0:4:27,45
brought before a tribunal of
one of these societies and


87
0:4:27,45 --> 0:4:30,53
condemned for any number
of transgressions.


88
0:4:30,53 --> 0:4:34,1
And in the end, I became
initiated in these societies,


89
0:4:34,1 --> 0:4:38,14
certainly, if not the only,
certainly one of the first


90
0:4:38,14 --> 0:4:40,26
outsiders ever to
become initiated


91
0:4:40,26 --> 0:4:42,72
in the Bizango Champwell.


92
0:4:42,72 --> 0:4:45,35
HAMILTON MORRIS: Not long after
vodou was recognized by


93
0:4:45,35 --> 0:4:48,87
whites, they began to
fear its power.


94
0:4:48,87 --> 0:4:50,97
Slaves found practicing
vodou were


95
0:4:50,97 --> 0:4:53,85
harshly punished or killed.


96
0:4:53,85 --> 0:4:57,46
Some slaves escaped their
masters and formed colonies in


97
0:4:57,46 --> 0:4:59,73
the mountains, where they could
practice their religious


98
0:4:59,73 --> 0:5:2,6
beliefs and live freely.


99
0:5:2,6 --> 0:5:4,87
They're known as the Maroons.


100
0:5:4,87 --> 0:5:7,52
It was the Maroons who
organized the first


101
0:5:7,52 --> 0:5:11,44
small-scale slave uprisings,
which culminated with the Bwa


102
0:5:11,44 --> 0:5:15,42
Kayiman vodou ceremony, in which
all in attendance who


103
0:5:15,42 --> 0:5:18,43
vowed to kill their white
masters were anointed with the


104
0:5:18,43 --> 0:5:20,89
blood of a slaughtered pig.


105
0:5:20,89 --> 0:5:25,24
This ceremony sparked the
beginning of the 1791 Haitian


106
0:5:25,24 --> 0:5:28,81
revolution, led by Toussaint
Louverture, and established


107
0:5:28,81 --> 0:5:33,1
Haiti as the first independent
black republic.


108
0:5:33,1 --> 0:5:35,68
It was the Maroons who
later became the


109
0:5:35,68 --> 0:5:38,26
Bizango secret societies.


110
0:5:38,26 --> 0:5:41,91
To some, the Bizango are a sort
of benevolent spiritual


111
0:5:41,91 --> 0:5:43,32
police force.


112
0:5:43,32 --> 0:5:47,1
But to many Haitians, they are a
feared band of cannibalistic


113
0:5:47,1 --> 0:5:50,4
criminals who feast on the
unsuspecting during midnight


114
0:5:50,4 --> 0:5:51,65
expeditions.


115
0:5:51,65 --> 0:6:0,99



116
0:6:0,99 --> 0:6:4,23
It is here that we meet
Tomas, the bokor.


117
0:6:4,23 --> 0:6:7,62
A bokor is the Haitian
equivalent of a sorcerer, or


118
0:6:7,62 --> 0:6:11,37
which doctor, shaman, or
medicine man, a retailer of


119
0:6:11,37 --> 0:6:15,7
potions, a plant doctor, a man
in direct contact with deep


120
0:6:15,7 --> 0:6:19,26
metaphysical realms.


121
0:6:19,26 --> 0:6:23,9
We enter the peristyle to find
it's meticulously painted with


122
0:6:23,9 --> 0:6:26,4
hundreds of images of white
people being stabbed in the


123
0:6:26,4 --> 0:6:30,32
neck by Satan, or being impaled
by Satan while their


124
0:6:30,32 --> 0:6:35,18
blood is consumed by
tricephalous snakes.


125
0:6:35,18 --> 0:6:40,21
There is also a Richard Avedon
poster of Nastassja Kinski.


126
0:6:40,21 --> 0:6:43,67
On the ground are three large
piles of glistening rock salt


127
0:6:43,67 --> 0:6:44,92
and an infant's coffin.


128
0:6:44,92 --> 0:6:47,63



129
0:6:47,63 --> 0:6:49,306
It is here that we meet Tomas.


130
0:6:49,306 --> 0:6:51,83



131
0:6:51,83 --> 0:6:54,8
Tomas is also the
mayor of Ennery.

214
0:12:14,1 --> 0:12:16,64
He then calls his friend to
arrange a meeting with a


215
0:12:16,64 --> 0:12:20,93
