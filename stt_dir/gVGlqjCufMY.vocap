###7 JF MUSIAL: McLaren is a brand synonymous with motor racing.
###10 Formula One is the most obvious connection.
###12 But McLaren was also involved with Can-Am
###14 racing as well as IndyCar.
###16 Founded in 1963 by Bruce McLaren, a former racer
###19 himself, it's one of the few brands in the world that
###22 invests itself so heavily into racing.
###25 
###79 JOHN ALLERT: It wouldn't surprise you to know when you
###81 come to a building like this that everything we do is about
###85 attention to detail.
###86 But it's not just attention to detail for detail's sake.
###89 It's always with an objective in mind.
###92 And 9 times out of 10, that objective is winning.
###96 We have other businesses where winning isn't necessarily
###99 being first across the line-- it's about being the best.
###102 But at the end of the day, everything we do is about
###105 being better than our peers, better than our competitors.
###108 JF MUSIAL: I have to ask though.
###109 You look at Bruce McLaren's vision and
###112 actually what Ron Dennis--
###115 how has McLaren transpired at after all these years to be
###118 what it is, from those initial idea?
###122 JOHN ALLERT: I think it's because it's the shared value
###124 systems that Bruce had and that Bruce
###127 imparted on his team.
###129 And then when Ron took over, he had very much those same
###132 values, but then just took them to a whole new level, was
###134 able to bring in greater finance.
###138 And that gave us the muscle to then develop that vision and
###141 take it into other areas.
###143 JF MUSIAL: What I love, though, is that you stay close
###145 to your racing history.
###147 This is incredible.
###148 JOHN ALLERT: Well, how can we not stay close
###149 to our racing history?
###150 I mean, our racing history is phenomenal.
###152 And we've won 1 in 4 of every Formula One race we've ever
###157 competed in.
###158 JF MUSIAL: Unheard of.
###159 JOHN ALLERT: We've been on the podium for 50% of every race
###162 we've ever competed in.
###163 So it's a pedigree and a heritage that we are obviously
###166 very proud of.
###167 We're not an extrovert business, but we feel very,
###170 very proud inwardly of that success.
###174 And it's that success that inspires the current
###177 generation of people at McLaren to try and take it to
###180 another level.
###180 How do people feel about all of this heritage?
###183 JF MUSIAL: Yeah.
###184 JOHN ALLERT: They feel enriched by it.
###185 You can't help but feel inspired by it.
###187 And it's one of the key reasons that we
###188 have it all on display.
###191 Your reaction when you walked in here is no different than
###193 anybody's reaction.
###194 Which is, wow, there's a Senna car, or there's a Prost car,
###197 or whatever it is.
###198 Everybody has their particular era that
###200 they get excited about.
###203 And for me just as one person, to actually see some of the
###206 cars here every day that I've actually stood on the other
###209 side of the wire from when I was 12 or 13
###212 years old, I get tingles.
###215 I get goosebumps just thinking about it.
###217 We've had people break down in tears seeing some of the cars
###220 that you've walked past today.
###222 JF MUSIAL: Walking into the MTC, it's as if you're walking
###225 into a science fiction movie--
###227 long corridors with highly metallic surfaces.
###230 You walk through hallways thinking Trent Reznor should
###233 score a soundtrack for all the guests to listen to as they
###236 enter the place for the first time.
###238 Everything is spotless.
###239 Everything is clean.
###240 You can tell everything is designed obsessively.
###242 And I'm not saying that in a cold way.
###245 In fact, the architecture allows for so much natural
###248 light into the work spaces it makes you feel awake, alive.
###252 JOHN ALLERT: This building was a vision conceived in the kind
###255 of mid to late '90s.
###256 JF MUSIAL: OK.
###257 JOHN ALLERT: Ron Dennis always wanted to bring the kind of
###260 the federation of companies together under one roof.
###263 We'd grown exponentially over a period of 20, 25 years.
###268 And we really were wanting the benefits of being back as one
###272 kind of collective.
###273 JF MUSIAL: Mm-hmm.
###274 JOHN ALLERT: We then wanted a showpiece both for commercial
###278 reasons, so that we could explain to people the vision
###280 of what we're all about and hopefully elicit their
###284 investment in us either as sponsors, or partners, or in
###287 some cases, investors, but also to make sure that we
###290 could recruit the best people, and get the best people to
###293 come and share in what it was that we were trying to build.
###295 And this facility really does inspire the
###298 people who work here.
###300 And I think that Ron really was ahead of time in creating
###303 something that people would just want to be in, want to be
###306 part of, as well as well as the success of
###309 the business itself.
###311 To actually come to a place like this is--
###313 it's an awe-inspiring environment in which to work.
###316 And it's a little like going on stage.
###319 You really feel like you have to up your game when you
###321 arrive here every morning.
###323 JF MUSIAL: It is an inviting experience, which makes sense.
###326 The MTC opened in 2003.
###328 And Ron Dennis was very influential in its design.
###331 Inside, you not only have McLaren Racing but also
###333 McLaren Automotive and the not so well known McLaren
###336 Electronics.
###338 Walking in here, you look at this, this is not what I was
###342 expecting at all.
###343 JOHN ALLERT: No, this looks--
###344 JF MUSIAL: This looks like a scientific laboratory.
###344 JOHN ALLERT: I was just going to say it looks like a
###345 laboratory.
###346 But it's not.
###347 This is part of McLaren Electronics.
###348 JF MUSIAL: Got it.
###349 JOHN ALLERT: So this is where ECUs are actually being
###352 physically created.
###353 I mean, we're printing circuit boards in there.
###356 That's high-end stuff.
###358 It's not the sexy end of the business.
###359 But it's very high-end.
###361 JF MUSIAL: Ron Dennis wanted the building to attract the
###363 best engineers and designers.
###364 But more importantly, he wanted to keep them there.
###368 Walking the hallways, you can tell everyone who works there
###370 has a sense of pride to be working within those walls.
###374 JOHN ALLERT: It's actually-- it's a very selfless culture.
###376 I think we attract like-minded people here who ultimately
###380 want to win and what to do the best they can possibly do in
###383 whatever role they have.
###385 But they're selfless people who want to come
###387 together as a team.
###388 And understand that actually the old cliche of 1 plus 1
###392 equals 3, that if they can all come together and be the best
###395 in their particular discipline, chances are that
###397 we're more likely to succeed or to win.
###399 And we have a lot to live up to.
###401 We have 49 years of success.
###404 In the time that we've been in Formula One, for example,
###406 there have been over 100 Formula
###408 One teams have failed--
###409 have come and gone, left Formula One.
###412 So this is no place for the weak or the meek.
###415 And we're reminded of those sorts of statistics every year
###419 when people either leave the automotive sector or they
###422 leave Formula One.
###425 And that's part of that pressure to make sure that
###428 we're being the best.
###429 Because it's a slippery pole.
###431 Either in supercars or in Formula One,
###433 it's a slippery pole.
###434 And those that aren't near the top have a real struggle.
###436 [INAUDIBLE]
###438 JF MUSIAL: Now, past the wind tunnel and the Formula One
###440 work bays, we walk down a long hallway, all underground, very
###444 James Bond-like.
###446 You then hit a set of stairs.
###448 You go up.
###449 And then you walk into what is called the
###451 McLaren Production Center.
###453 This is McLaren Automotive.
###455 This is the future of McLaren.
###457 LEE BOYCE: So right now, this is the north end of the MPC.
###461 This is a VIP area.
###462 This is a hosting suite.
###463 So this is basically where potential customers, or
###465 dignitaries, or any type of VIP can come to this area.
###468 And from this area, we lead directly out onto the
###472 production facility, just around this corner here.
###474 JF MUSIAL: OK.
###474 LEE BOYCE: And I think you need to see that.
###475 JF MUSIAL: Let's go check it out.
###476 So how old is this place?
###478 LEE BOYCE: So we've been operating in here now for--
###480 JF MUSIAL: Whoa!
###481 Look at this!
###481 LEE BOYCE: --eight months.
###482 
###505 JF MUSIAL: And you're in full production at this point.
###507 That is incredible.
###507 LEE BOYCE: We are flat-out production.
###509 And we have been now since the turn of the year.
###514 We have been at full capacity in terms of our planning
###517 requirements for this year.
###518 And for sure, everything, from a production point of view is
###523 going absolutely beautifully at this moment.
###524 JF MUSIAL: This is surreal.
###525 LEE BOYCE: Yes.
###526 JF MUSIAL: It's almost a [INAUDIBLE] room.
###526 And it mimics the MTC but on a different level.
###530 Prior to the MP4-12C, McLaren built my favorite hypercar,
###533 the F1, then after that, the SLR, which was built right
###537 alongside the F1 cars.
###538 But now, for the new MP4-12C, it's an entirely new building.
###543 The first thing I noticed there was that there was a lot
###545 of unused space.
###546 McLaren has been around for about 50 years.
###548 But McLaren Automotive is essentially an
###550 entirely new company.
###551 They built the McLaren Production Center knowing they
###554 would be building other models besides the MP4-12C.
###558 LEE BOYCE: Actually, what you're looking at now is the
###560 best part of 20,000 square meters of floor space on which
###565 we want to produce the vehicle.
###566 We worked really hard to make sure that we could integrate
###569 all of the processes that were absolutely critical to
###572 ensuring that the assembly of this vehicle was felt on
###577 absolute personal level from an operator's point of view,
###579 but also gave the customer a really good feeling that
###581 actually, his ownership experience didn't start when
###583 he took the car.
###584 It actually started at the placement of order.
###587 And therefore, if he wanted to visit this facility, he could
###588 actually come and see his vehicle being birthed.
###590 All of the technicians feel as though they're involved in
###593 making that person's car.
###594 So it's not just a vehicle.
###596 They accept that there behind that is a customer, and a
###599 valued customer.
###600 And we wanted to make sure that his ownership experience
###603 started right here from the moment we first loaded any
###606 components into the facility.
###607 If we keep taking a look down here--
###609 JF MUSIAL: So this is Phase 1 right here.
###610 LEE BOYCE: So this is absolutely the
###612 start of the process.
###612 JF MUSIAL: OK.
###613 So this is the MP4-12C monococque right here.
###616 LEE BOYCE: We didn't want any feel of industrialization in
###618 the facility.
###620 We wanted it to be a theater.
###622 JF MUSIAL: [CHUCKLES]
###623 LEE BOYCE: It was really important to us that we create
###624 an environment where everything felt special and
###628 everything felt personal.
###629 And I think we've achieved that.
###631 So what you don't see is you don't see any significant
###633 levels of automation.
###634 You don't see clunking--
###636 JF MUSIAL: You almost see none.
###636 LEE BOYCE: --chains.
###637 You don't see any conveyors.
###638 You won't see air lines or anything like this.
###640 It's all very quiet.
###642 It's all very composed.
###644 And it's all very simple in its execution.
###646 If we take a look at some of the racking and what have you,
###649 there are a number of components such as fastenings
###651 and such as brackets and that where we can clearly hold
###653 quite a decent level of stock holding lineside.
###656 And as you can see with things like these front long
###659 [INAUDIBLE], we've designed some bespoke stillaging to
###662 allow us to--
###662 JF MUSIAL: Just for these parts?
###663 LEE BOYCE: Just for these particular parts.
###664 And we have bespoke stillaging all around the facility.
###666 But I think what's a really good, tactile thing about what
###671 you're looking at right now is if you look at the diameter
###675 and the radius of the bespoke stillaging, it's absolutely
###679 the same as the radius and the diameter of the racking.
###684 As you could see, this is where the vehicle's being more
###686 and more progressed through its build assembly phase.
###689 So the windscreen surround is going on there.
###690 And the B-pillar carting is going on here.
###692 So even though we have 100% confidence in the facilities,
###697 and the equipment, and the whole
###698 process with these guys--
###701 and we are 100% confident--
###702 that doesn't stop us taking every single body, and it is
###706 every single body, and processing them into the
###710 Geometric and Surface Validation station.
###713 
###727 So this is Geometric and Surface Validation.
###730 So basically, every single body--
###732 even though we're 100% confident it's in a good
###735 place, we still want to measure it just to ensure that
###738 we don't get any quality drift in the overall body's vehicle
###743 assembly status.
###745 JF MUSIAL: So this whole rig here is just for measurement.
###747 LEE BOYCE: So everything that you're seeing here is
###749 absolutely for measurement.
###750 So if we take a lot of surface points.
###752 We take hundreds of surface points.
###753 We take hundreds of geometric points on the vehicle to
###756 ensure that we know that the car is in a really good place
###759 dimensionally.
###760 The body would exit these double doors here.
###763 JF MUSIAL: Got it.
###763 LEE BOYCE: Which are closed at the moment.
###765 Then it will go into-- this is the paint facility now.
###769 In essence, the vehicle through this paint facility is
###771 processed across two skids.
###773 The body goes on one particular skid and all of the
###775 other supplementary panels go onto another.
###779 This is the single biggest piece of investment in terms
###782 of equipment in the whole of MPC.
###785 And so we've pushed all of the potential suppliers--
###788 with regard to paint facilities--
###790 hard in terms of making sure that in their thinking,
###793 they've got absolutely what we were all about in terms of an
###795 installation.
###796 So whilst all of them could have satisfied us
###797 technically--
###798 that's not a problem--
###799 we wanted to make sure that this was right as well.
###802 This was really important for us to make sure that they
###804 understood our philosophies, our methodologies, and they
###808 clearly understand that from a brand augmentation point of
###811 view, whatever they install absolutely complemented them.
###814 Because what it creates is it creates a completely different
###816 mindset of thinking for the technician.
###819 What it demonstrates to the technician is that we've
###821 thought about their working environment as much as we have
###824 the product and the customer.
###826 Because if we create a perfect work environment for them,
###828 they can only ever give their best of themselves.
###831 And I actually think you get that natural transfer into the
###834 vehicle there.
###834 And you get an uplift of in-built
###836 vehicle processing quality.
###838 I'm absolutely convinced of that.
###840 So what you're seeing here now is worth seeing.
###842 
###845 This is what we call Skid 2.
###847 And it's just had its base coat applied.
###848 That won't go forward until they put the clear coat on
###852 those particular booths here.
###853 The whole facility-- even though we designed the
###856 facility such that if we wanted to put
###859 robots in here, we could.
###861 And whilst robots have got great dexterity--
###863 and they have-- and you can put all sorts of convoluted
###865 and complicated programs into them, there's nothing more
###869 dexterous than the human.
###870 And what a robot doesn't have as well, he doesn't have the
###873 eye as well.
###876 It's an application process.
###877 There's nothing emotional about it.
###879 It's very clinical.
###880 It's just application.
###883 Here, these guys can take a view on when they think
###886 they've done something absolutely the
###888 right way or not.
###888 And they've got an opportunity to do a level of reparation in
###892 the booth should a mistake have been made or should they
###894 see something on the vehicle, then they think, oh, that
###896 doesn't look quite right, there's an opportunity here to
###899 do that reparation.
###900 So [INAUDIBLE]
###901 this is an audit line.
###902 And so basically, when the vehicle has had its clear coat
###905 put on, it goes into the oven through
###907 those glass doors there.
###907 There's exits here.
###909 And this is the first point we do some inspection.
###911 Every single vehicle gets a full surface quality
###913 inspection.
###914 The great thing about this facility is we have enough
###916 flexibility in here to always do a fix the same day such
###919 that it doesn't disrupt our output
###921 requirements for the process.
###924 So it comes all the way down this particular facility here,
###926 shuffles across again, and then goes into the polishing
###928 and final finishing site.
###930 Every single car gets a full flat and polish so that we
###933 raise the optical aspect of the vehicle.
###936 So we create a far greater level of depth
###939 on the color itself.
###940 So you can actually look into the color.
###942 And you're not just looking at surface.
###943 You're actually looking into the color.
###946 
###965 FRANK STEPHENSON: Everything you see on the car, we like to
###968 say it is done for a reason.
###969 Which means that everything that you see has an effect on
###971 the overall performance of the car.
###973 And more so also, when they do say form follows function,
###978 that sounds nice and everything.
###980 But with this car, pretty much,
###981 it's form equals function.
###983 What looks right works.
###984 What we've done is, of course, you have the two main intakes
###987 on the front which are for your inner coolers.
###989 They specifically have to get a lot of very air in there
###992 very efficiently and do the job of cooling.
###995 But also, we have what we call a splitter
###997 right here in the front.
###998 And that creates a lot of downforce, creates the right
###1002 feel for the road with the car.
###1005 This area is very critical underneath.
###1007 If you rub your hand underneath, you'll feel some,
###1010 what we call diblets.
###1010 They're little--
###1011 JF MUSIAL: Oh, yeah.
###1012 FRANK STEPHENSON: --pumps that actually straighten out the
###1013 airflow underneath, things that you don't even see, but
###1016 they're on the car.
###1017 I mean, every detail is really taken to the max on this car.
###1020 This is what we called biomimicry.
###1022 There's a lot of influence from what really works.
###1024 Some organisms in the world use this type of design
###1028 feature for purpose basically.
###1031 We have had a little bit of freedom with the headlights.
###1033 This is where you can really start to give the car a little
###1035 bit of a unique look.
###1037 It's almost as if it's the eyes of the person.
###1040 Eyes do give people a lot of character.
###1042 So we're not really influencing too much
###1046 technology here.
###1047 We are using high-tech Xenon lamps.
###1049 But you can see that the actual form of your daytime
###1052 running lamps sort of creates the feel of the McLaren logo.
###1055 JF MUSIAL: Uh-huh.
###1056 FRANK STEPHENSON: We let the light bleed through these
###1058 three little slots here which are almost
###1060 like fins or gills--
###1061 JF MUSIAL: Gills-- that's exactly what I was going to--
###1062 FRANK STEPHENSON: --of a shark.
###1063 JF MUSIAL: --going to describe as gills.
###1064 FRANK STEPHENSON: And that sort of-- when you're in the
###1065 front, you look back and you see that, it really gives the
###1067 car its own unique look to it.
###1069 Another thing that we've really concentrated on is
###1071 keeping the cowl, the back of the hood, as low as we can for
###1075 full optimal forward visibility.
###1078 So we pushed it quite far down.
###1079 That gives us a great viewing angle from
###1082 the driver's position.
###1084 And one of the funny things that you would not really
###1087 notice unless you're actually sitting in the car-- it's very
###1089 interesting-- is that the center point of the wheel is
###1092 directly under the highest point of the fender.
###1096 Which means when you're actually sitting down, you
###1099 know where your wheels are placed to hit the apex.
###1101 JF MUSIAL: Because you see it.
###1102 FRANK STEPHENSON: Because you know that the farthest point
###1103 you're looking-- or the highest point-- is actually
###1106 the center of the wheel.
###1106 So you can really place it--
###1108 JF MUSIAL: Interesting.
###1108 FRANK STEPHENSON: --precisely that way.
###1110 Really important is actually this blade that we have here
###1112 on the side.
###1113 And although it looks kind of like an element that we sat
###1115 down and designed and had fun with, it really came out of
###1119 the computer, out of what we call CFD,
###1122 Computational Fluid Dynamics.
###1124 And in our intent to make the car as small as possible and
###1128 center all the weight towards the center of the car, we've
###1130 actually turned the radiators parallel to the direction of
###1134 the car to get the weight, the mass, all towards the middle.
###1137 This blade here has been done on the computer such that it
###1141 generates or actually keeps the air attached to it.
###1144 And it throws it in on an accelerated curve.
###1146 So you get plenty of coin that way.
###1150 So this blade is [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###1151 very necessary.
###1153 Of course, it adds flavor to the car and
###1154 makes it more unique.
###1155 But it's there for a reason, as I said.
###1158 Another element that I really like on the car is what we
###1160 call the air brake on the back of the car.
###1162 And we don't consider it a spoiler.
###1166 It's not even used as a spoiler.
###1168 It's basically a way of adjusting the
###1171 braking on the car.
###1172 So anytime you break in anger--
###1174 JF MUSIAL: In anger--
###1175 I like that.
###1175 [LAUGHTER]
###1175 FRANK STEPHENSON: Well, with intent to break, I guess, to
###1179 slow down--
###1180 it goes 90 degrees.
###1181 And what happens then is that the center of gravity actually
###1186 moves back towards the back of the car and puts more weight
###1190 on the back wheels so that you can actually use the breaks in
###1192 the rear a little bit more.
###1193 A lot of the action is actually done by the wind
###1195 itself, not by pushing it up but releasing it.
###1198 And then lift-- go up on its own.
###1201 One of the design words that we use a lot on the car is to
###1205 actually-- for the language--
###1206 is actually to almost, like, shrink-wrap the surface.
###1209 Whereas a lot of cars add volume, what we're trying here
###1214 to do is take away volume.
###1216 So you're almost, like, shrink-wrapping the metal over
###1218 the hard points, which are suspension mounts, or vision
###1221 angles, or head clearance angles, whatever.
###1224 So we're trying to minimize, take weight out of the car, by
###1226 reducing the amount of surface area we have running.
###1229 JF MUSIAL: Got it.
###1230 LEE BOYCE: So this is basically the start of the
###1232 trim and final part of the process.
###1234 This is where we start layering the car and
###1236 installing it ready for us to take it to a point of--
###1238 JF MUSIAL: No wiring harness?
###1239 Wiring harness?
###1240 LEE BOYCE: Wiring harness--it's
###1240 as simple as that.
###1241 JF MUSIAL: Yeah.
###1242 LEE BOYCE: So we have the opportunity of being able to
###1244 produce the same amount of cars in this facility as any
###1248 of our competitors with their levels of industrialization.
###1252 You don't actually need that.
###1253 And we wanted to create a different blueprint for how to
###1257 build cars.
###1258 And if we take a look at these vehicle ramps here, these are
###1262 a standard vehicle ramp.
###1263 But we wanted to make sure that we put some nice
###1265 architectural cladding around it.
###1266 And we made sure that we set all of the services underneath
###1269 the tiles as well.
###1270 So you do not see any lines.
###1273 And that's why everything is really clean.
###1275 And it was really important to us that we didn't trailing air
###1278 lines, and we didn't see trailing cables.
###1280 This is a really interesting feature in the facility.
###1284 Again, same diameter, same radius, but what's really
###1286 interesting here is that all of the services are in a
###1288 trench here.
###1290 JF MUSIAL: Got it.
###1290 LEE BOYCE: So we have this trench that runs the full
###1292 length of the building.
###1292 We have those in three or four places across the building.
###1296 All of the services actually go feed up through the back of
###1299 these tool cabinets there, so that all of the IT
###1302 functionality is fed up through here as well.
###1305 So you don't see any cables here.
###1307 And if you need to use compressed air or you need to
###1308 use single phase electrics, it's all
###1310 embedded within the facility.
###1312 And you just don't see any cabling.
###1315 Every single operator is accountable for his work.
###1319 They work with what we call--
###1321 we have this little access swipe system.
###1323 So when the car comes into the facility, every single
###1325 operator has to swipe his card.
###1328 If we take a look here--
###1330 I won't do it because it means I'll have to start assembling
###1332 parts of the car.
###1332 But he would swipe his card across the reader there.
###1335 And then that locks him personally into that
###1337 particular vehicle to undertake a certain amount of
###1339 work on that particular car.
###1340 JF MUSIAL: He's responsible.
###1340 LEE BOYCE: He's absolutely 100% responsible.
###1343 Now, we're getting into the final stages of--
###1345 JF MUSIAL: I'm seeing a bunch of grease pen on here.
###1346 So 248, 248-- so that's how you identify [INAUDIBLE]
###1349 LEE BOYCE: That's how we identify--
###1350 JF MUSIAL: [INAUDIBLE]
###1351 LEE BOYCE: Absolutely.
###1351 So this particular panel was painted with
###1353 this particular body.
###1353 So that we absolutely make sure we don't get any
###1356 inconsistencies with color matching or
###1358 anything like this.
###1358 JF MUSIAL: Got it.
###1360 LEE BOYCE: And not only that--
###1361 we want to make sure that this particular component is going
###1364 to be reset with this particular door, so we get a
###1367 really good fit and finish from a gap and profile point
###1369 of view as well.
###1370 LEE BOYCE: JF MUSIAL: Got it.
###1371 So what we're doing here now on this particular station--
###1372 this is the geometry setup lift.
###1374 This is basically where we do toe, camber, ride heights, and
###1378 all of that sort of thing in readiness for when we go into
###1380 the dynamic rig.
###1383 JF MUSIAL: Cool.
###1384 LEE BOYCE: [INAUDIBLE]
###1384 This is where we put the car through its first
###1386 real dynamic load.
###1387 So we do an engine fire-up further
###1389 upstream in the process.
###1390 And this is where we put the car through some
###1392 dynamic load here now.
###1393 So basically, we bring the car up to temperature, check most
###1395 of the electrical systems are working, and all of the brains
###1399 in the vehicle are communicating with each other.
###1403 We do some brake activity.
###1405 We do some acceleration, deceleration.
###1408 But just generally, put the car through some immediate
###1410 dynamic loads.
###1411 JF MUSIAL: Yeah.
###1411 LEE BOYCE: So in essence, vehicle goes through a dynamic
###1413 rig into the Monsoon where we give it a full
###1415 saturation of water.
###1416 I don't know--
###1416 16,000 liters in about 6 or 7 minutes-- it's a
###1419 huge amount of water.
###1421 Car exits there.
###1422 It then gets prepared, ready for external drive appraisal.
###1426 They all leave through that door there.
###1427 JF MUSIAL: OK.
###1428 LEE BOYCE: Goes out on its external drive appraisal where
###1429 we put it through some more aggressive loads.
###1432 One of things-- when we were landscaping the whole
###1434 exterior, the outside of the facility, what was really
###1437 important to us was to try and optimize the land
###1440 around us as well.
###1441 So we've got cobbled sections of roadway out there which
###1445 allow us to shake and rattle the car a little bit just to
###1447 loosen anything.
###1447 Go before we actually take it on the highways and byways.
###1450 JF MUSIAL: Ah.
###1450 LEE BOYCE: Obviously, during the wetter seasons in the
###1453 year, the car could come back with some muck and what have
###1455 you on them.
###1455 And that's why we just have this wash down rig here now.
###1458 So we just give the underside a quick wash down and just
###1460 make sure that the vehicle is fully cleaned
###1463 before it exits here.
###1464 It would sit normally on here for 45 minutes, just to have a
###1467 final drip-dry.
###1468 We take a look at the vehicle after its been out on an
###1470 external drive.
###1472 And what we do is we're basically checking to make
###1474 sure that nothing has worked loose, there are no weeps, or
###1477 leaks, or anything like that from any of the joints.
###1479 JF MUSIAL: Yeah.
###1481 LEE BOYCE: There's been no displacement of any harness
###1483 clips or anything like this.
###1484 And everything [INAUDIBLE] is absolutely how we want it to
###1486 be-- a very, very critical station.
###1489 We're getting ourselves ready to hand the car over to the
###1492 auditors with what we perceive to be a car that is acceptable
###1497 for the customer.
###1499 The auditors then give it a really thorough investigation,
###1503 an interrogation.
###1504 And again, they go to the nth degree of checking service
###1509 quality, checking fit and finish, checking functionality
###1513 of all of the systems.
###1514 JF MUSIAL: So that's it.
###1517 These cars go to the customers, right?
###1519 LEE BOYCE: These cars are ready to go to the customer.
###1521 JF MUSIAL: So where's--
###1522 LEE BOYCE: [INAUDIBLE]
###1522 JF MUSIAL: Where's the car I'm driving?
###1523 LEE BOYCE: Unfortunately, it's not one of these.
###1524 But just for you, we have one back at the base.
###1528 JF MUSIAL: Cool.
###1528 LEE BOYCE: OK.
###1529 JF MUSIAL: Thank you.
###1530
