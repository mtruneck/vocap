###7 ALICE ROBERTS: they say this is where it all began.
###14 that we are all children of Africa.
###20 But if so, why do we look so different?
###26 And how on earth could a handful of African families
###30 become a whole world full of people?
###45 I'm Alice Roberts, medical doctor and anthropologist.
###50 I'm fascinated by what bones, stones,
###55 and even our bodies can reveal about the distant past.
###61 I'm going in search of the traces left by our African ancestors
###65 and their journeys to populate the world.
###70 this time, Europe.
###73 A dangerous journey
###76 and a formidable rival.
###81 We're going to be excavating the sea bottom
###83 in search of Neanderthals.
###85 the unexpected weapons in our battle for survival.
###90 I don't think it would have even crossed my mind to mate with a Neanderthal.
###95 Spectacular new discoveries.
###97 I'm blown away by that. I mean, that is just amazing.
###101 And the surprising story of why Europeans turned white.
###110 Come with me in the footsteps of our ancestors
###114 on the most epic adventure ever undertaken.
###138 My journey begins in the remote forests of Eastern Europe.
###145 SILvIu: Okay, so you see the cave is down there.
###150 ROBERTS: I'm being led to an ancient cave.
###154 Its location is only known to a handful of people,
###158 including Silviu constantin.
###176 I'm in Romania, somewhere to the south of Transylvania,
###180 and I'm just about to enter the cave of pestera cu Oase.
###185 It's very remote -
###187 about a day and a half's drive from the capital, Bucharest,
###190 and then a trek through the woods.
###192 But I've wanted to come to this place
###195 ever since I first heard what was found here.
###198 Because just a few years ago
###199 an incredibly exciting discovery was made in this cave.
###210 (WATER DRIPPING)
###215 ROBERTS: Something had been hidden here for thousands of years.
###219 Something extremely rare.
###225 In 2002,
###227 a group of divers exploring the furthest reaches of the cave
###232 discovered a hidden chamber.
###236 the cave became known as Pestera cu Oase,
###240 ''the cave of Bones. ''
###242 (SILvIU SPEAKING ENGLISH)
###246 ROBERTS: And how's it looking? Are we gonna have to go right underwater?
###248 (SILvIU SPEAKING ENGLISH)
###256 ROBERTS: We're following the course of an underground river
###261 through narrow tunnels.
###265 ROBERTS: pretty tight.
###278 Eventually, we get close to where the discovery was made.
###285 (PEOPLE CHATTERING)
###295 Silviu, this looks like the end of the line.
###297 (SILvIU SPEAKING ENGLISH)
###299 And, Silviu, when you came to the cave, what did you find here?
###303 (SPEAKING ENGLISH)
###318 ROBERTS: And how old is it?
###321 And 40,000 years old makes it
###324 the first human remains, modern-human remains,
###327 in Europe, and you must have been excited when you got that date.
###331 (SILvIU SPEAKING ENGLISH)
###335 Which was...
###338 (SPEAKING ENGLISH)
###352 And this is what they found.
###355 Not in one piece like this, but in hundreds of fragments
###359 which have been painstakingly glued back together
###362 until we can look at the face of the first known modern European.
###372 And we can be absolutely sure that this is a modern human.
###377 The shape of the skull is unmistakable.
###380 This lovely round brain case just gives it away.
###385 But there are some bits of it that are distinctly less modern-looking.
###390 It's got enormous teeth.
###392 They are massive, compared with the teeth of people today.
###397 Now, those huge teeth are also reflected in the jawbone from the cave,
###401 which is from another person,
###403 but it's also very robust, very chunky.
###407 And so, when I look at the jawbone and the skull together,
###410 I can start to imagine what those early Europeans looked like.
###415 Much more rugged in the face than people do today.
###426 ROBERTS: Who was this person?
###441 Forensic artist Richard Neave
###443 has helped the police solve murder cases by reconstructing faces from skulls.
###452 In the hope of discovering more about the first Europeans
###456 we've asked him to reconstruct the face of the Oase skull.
###463 -So this is Oase. -This is Oase. There we are.
###470 It's wonderful to see, him or her, we're not quite sure, are we...
###474 -No, no. -...fleshed out.
###476 RICHARD: A touch androgynous, maybe, this one.
###478 ROBERTS: It's quite strange, actually,
###480 'cause this doesn't particularly look like
###482 European or African or Asian. It looks, sort of,
###485 almost quite generic, but then I suppose
###488 that's what you'd expect from one of the earliest Europeans.
###491 RICHARD: You look at this and you can think to yourself,
###493 it could go either way.
###494 (STAMMERS) It's almost as though it's a face in flux.
###498 It's got features which could go in any direction.
###501 It could become Negroid. It could become Southeast Asian.
###507 It could become European.
###510 There's the potential for all those different directions
###513 and that's what I find so exciting about it.
###516 ROBERTS: Obviously you've made this in clay and that's why it's brown, but...
###519 -Yes. -...in fact, it's very likely that these
###522 earliest of Europeans were
###525 quite dark-skinned, much, much darker-skinned
###527 than we think of Europeans being today.
###530 -Yes. -Because, at the end of the day,
###531 you know, they're only just arriving in Europe.
###534 They're coming from much more tropical places.
###536 -Yeah. -So, I think, you know,
###537 we may be looking at something which is actually quite lifelike here.
###539 RICHARD: We're not too far from... No. ROBERTS: No.
###547 I've been really excited to see what this face would end up looking like,
###551 and I do feel as though I'm getting much closer to our ancestors.
###559 But where did these first European people come from?
###566 And why do we find their bones in a Romanian cave?
###580 Previously, I found evidence that everyone outside Africa
###584 descends from one small group of people
###587 that left the continent around 70,000 years ago.
###594 Some of their descendants must have made it north,
###598 through the Middle East, towards modern-day turkey.
###613 This is border country.
###615 Thirty miles away, Turkey meets Syria and the Middle East.
###619 Today, everything in that direction might look alien and hostile,
###623 but 50,000 years ago
###625 it was Europe, the land that lay ahead,
###628 which would be more dangerous than they could ever have imagined.
###637 Venturing this way, people would have been coming to lands
###640 far colder and more challenging than anything they'd experienced before.
###648 traces of their journey all that time ago
###652 are few and far between.
###658 But some important clues have been unearthed
###662 in southern turkey.
###669 And this is how we know that people came through Turkey
###673 at this point in time.
###674 Now, it might look utterly insignificant,
###677 but shells like this one were found at a place
###680 called ucagizli on the Turkish coast
###682 and they are vital clues.
###685 The hole in them suggests
###687 that they were pendants, perhaps part of a necklace,
###689 and the ucagizli shell beads
###691 date back to around 42,000 years ago.
###695 They are the first pieces of evidence that we have
###698 as we follow the trail of our European ancestors.
###706 there may have been other routes into Europe,
###709 but the evidence we have seems to point in this direction.
###717 So I'm heading to Istanbul.
###736 Here, for a few turkish lira,
###738 taxi drivers like Ehsan Akmar
###740 carry their passengers between two continents.
###743 EHSAN: That's Golden Horn. ROBERTS: Right.
###745 (LAuGHING) I'll tell you what, I'll hold that, you drive.
###748 No, no. Don't worry about that. I don't kill anybody yet.
###750 Allah! Allah! Why you don't trust me?
###752 (ROBERTS LAuGHING)
###753 (EHSAN SPEAKING ARABIC)
###755 ROBERTS: So, Ehsan, as a taxi driver... EHSAN: Yeah?
###756 ...do you cross over between Asia and Europe every day?
###760 -Most people live in Asian side. -ROBERTS: Yeah.
###762 Working that side. Because most office and business here,
###767 more houses there.
###769 But I'm here looking for traces of people who crossed the Bosporus
###773 maybe 50, maybe 40,000 years ago.
###777 My God! How can I know that time?
###779 (SPEAKING ARABIC)
###781 Let me I pray.
###782 (BOTH LAuGHING)
###783 This is too...
###784 I don't know how can this generation...
###786 How can I know that generation? My God!
###788 Alice, now, you're made me trouble that kind. But that's okay.
###797 ROBERTS: I bail out of the taxi and catch the ferry
###801 to cross from one continent to another.
###811 this is the Bosporus,
###813 and here it separates Asia from Europe.
###828 this is one challenge our ancestors would not have faced.
###834 When they came this way, sea levels were much lower
###838 and they could have walked across into Europe.
###856 But can we really retrace their steps, using only a few shells
###861 and a scattering of artefacts?
###864 The good news is we don't have to.
###867 The evidence is all around us -
###869 or to be more precise, inside all of us.
###873 Our DNA tells us something incredible
###876 by revealing the existence of one very special woman.
###882 We don't know who she was or where she lived.
###885 And in fact, we have no physical evidence of her at all.
###888 No bones. No stone tools. No beads.
###892 But we do know that she existed because of her genetic legacy.
###897 And some scientists have felt moved to name her Europa,
###901 because in one sense hers is the founding lineage of Europe.
###910 today, 10% of Europeans can trace their genes
###913 back to this one woman.
###915 Geneticists estimate that she lived around 40,000 years ago.
###920 And that fits with the archaeological evidence,
###923 like those shell beads.
###927 It's incredible to think of Europa's descendants
###930 as a small wave of nomads, making their way through this region
###935 all those years ago.
###941 But where might they have gone next?
###957 For our ancestors, where I'm going now
###959 would have been a journey into the unknown.
###961 This is the River Danube,
###963 and today it flows through capital cities like Budapest and vienna.
###968 But 40,000 years ago,
###970 it would have been a gateway to a whole new world.
###974 I'm going to follow our ancestors upstream,
###976 right into the heart of Europe.
###997 North of Istanbul is the Black Sea,
###1000 and the mouth of the Danube.
###1002 the river runs through Romania,
###1005 very close to the Oase cave and the earliest known European.
###1010 It looks like those first few colonisers may have been using the Danube
###1016 as a super-highway, heading west.
###1028 But as they followed the Danube's mighty meandering course,
###1032 they were in for a shock.
###1035 Something or someone had got there before them.
###1049 Europa's descendants weren't entering virgin territory.
###1063 For a quarter of a million years,
###1064 another species of human had called Europe home.
###1072 the Neanderthals.
###1083 This is a reconstruction of a man who lived a very long time ago in Italy.
###1088 And he's not a modern human, he's a Neanderthal.
###1092 And I think when you first look at his face,
###1097 the similarities probably strike you more than the differences,
###1100 so he looks quite human.
###1103 Would you notice him walking along in the street?
###1106 But then there are things which do look a bit odd.
###1109 The distance between his eyes.
###1111 The breadth of his nose, just here.
###1113 That looks a bit strange.
###1115 And he's got this amazing brow ridge.
###1119 It really sticks out over his eyes.
###1125 Neanderthals are our distant cousins.
###1128 their ancestors reached Europe
###1130 hundreds of thousands of years before us.
###1134 they spread across a huge region,
###1137 from Siberia to Spain.
###1141 So when Homo sapiens first arrived around 40,000 years ago,
###1146 Europe was already taken.
###1156 What were our ancestors up against?
###1161 the popular image of Neanderthals is lumbering and slow-witted.
###1174 ROBERTS: What do you think they would have thought of each other?
###1177 (LAuGHS) I think they would have been really scared of each other.
###1180 It's actually very hard to imagine what they would have thought of each other.
###1183 I think it would have been a fascinating experience
###1186 to watch a sort of contact like that,
###1188 between two very closely related species,
###1191 that are also clearly very different from each other,
###1193 both anatomically, as you can see, but also behaviourally.
###1197 And in terms of differences between Neanderthals and modern humans,
###1200 is there anything we can say about
###1202 how that might have influenced behaviour?
###1204 Okay, the one thing to point out is that
###1207 Neanderthals were actually sophisticated hunters,
###1209 we know that they were top predators.
###1211 And actually, they have very large brains -
###1214 on average, larger than ours.
###1220 ROBERTS: As well as big brains,
###1221 the Neanderthals may have had another advantage.
###1225 they had been in Europe long enough to adapt to the cold.
###1230 their stocky bodies and short limbs
###1233 helped them to stay warm.
###1236 And that's not all.
###1239 This is a reconstructed Neanderthal skeleton,
###1242 and generally speaking the skeleton is very similar to ours.
###1247 Having said that,
###1248 there are definite differences -
###1250 the shape of all the bones is subtly different.
###1253 And anywhere that muscles attach on this skeleton
###1256 is much more prominent than it would be in a modern human.
###1260 So this would have been a person who was much more heavily muscled,
###1264 generally much more rugged-looking than us today.
###1272 they would have been formidable competitors.
###1291 The Neanderthals were tougher and better cold-adapted than us,
###1295 and some of them even had bigger brains than modern humans.
###1299 On the face of it, then,
###1301 it seems quite surprising that our species lasted very long at all.
###1306 So how did we overcome the Neanderthals?
###1313 Maybe our tools and weapons were just better than theirs.
###1318 Well, for decades that's exactly what the experts thought.
###1326 But this idea hadn't been thoroughly tested - until now.
###1332 So how are you doing?
###1335 Oh, doing all right.
###1336 (ALL SIGH)
###1338 ROBERTS: Bruce Bradley and Metin Eren spent over a year
###1342 making thousands of basic cutting tools.
###1349 ROBERTS: So you've got these two tools, this one
###1351 a basic tool made by a Neanderthal,
###1353 and this one a basic tool made by a modern human,
###1355 -at the same sort of period. -BRuCE: Correct.
###1358 Now, they're obviously very different-looking.
###1359 This one's long and thin and this one is round.
###1362 But are they different in terms of function,
###1364 in terms of what they're used for?
###1366 They were used for the same kind of tasks. Mostly cutting tasks.
###1369 So, for example, I mean, both are really sharp,
###1372 if you want to use both of those to cut.
###1374 Some pretty thick leather here.
###1375 ROBERTS: This is a typical Neanderthal tool?
###1377 Exactly. You can see that
###1379 it just cuts through this very thick leather very easily.
###1381 (LAuGHS) That is incredibly sharp.
###1384 METIN: Yes. ROBERTS: Look at that. Wow.
###1386 -And this is really tough leather. -That's really effective, isn't it?
###1389 ROBERTS: That's brilliant. METIN: Yeah.
###1391 BRuCE: Now let's try the blade.
###1392 Hold it very carefully, 'cause it's...
###1394 ROBERTS: This is the sort of thing that was made by modern humans.
###1396 BRuCE: Exactly.
###1401 ROBERTS: If anything, I would say that the flake is a bit...
###1403 I mean, that's cutting, but just...
###1406 You know, just picking up the tool and using it immediately,
###1408 I'd say the flake's actually a bit easier to use.
###1410 When we created thousands of tools,
###1413 we found that the technology of the Neanderthals
###1417 actually produced more cutting edge, overall,
###1421 it wasted less raw material and you could produce more tools
###1424 than the blade cores of the modern Homo sapiens.
###1427 I imagine that's very new, isn't it?
###1429 It's quite remarkable, because you're telling me
###1431 that the Neanderthal technology is just as good,
###1434 in fact, if not better than the modern humans'.
###1436 I mean, that goes against everything
###1438 that people have said for the last few decades.
###1440 That's true, and it was a very exciting result.
###1447 ROBERTS: It's just one study
###1449 on one aspect of tool-making.
###1453 But I still think it's important.
###1458 This is fascinating, and it means that the long-standing theory
###1463 about modern human technology being superior to Neanderthal stone tools
###1469 just doesn't stand up.
###1480 I want to see if there's another explanation
###1483 for why we survived and Neanderthals didn't.
###1492 I'm on my way to meet an expert
###1495 who thinks the answer may be much less obvious...
###1501 Okay, Alice, let's see if I can find everything.
###1505 ROBERTS: ...thanks to some discoveries made here in Germany.
###1513 This is a very unusual artefact, because it's a flute
###1518 and the strange thing about this is, what's really spectacular,
###1521 is that it's made of solid mammoth ivory.
###1524 It takes between 50 and 100 hours to make one if you know how to do it.
###1527 ROBERTS: Yeah. It's been carved down to that shape.
###1529 Yes. It really takes talent and, really, genius in the same sense that,
###1533 I don't know, a Michelangelo or Rembrandt or something like that.
###1537 ROBERTS: So it's the first sign we've had,
###1539 the first archaeological evidence we've had
###1542 of people making music?
###1543 Yeah. Music was a part of their lives
###1546 just like it's a part of our lives today.
###1548 So what's in here?
###1549 Okay. This is a very interesting piece. This is...
###1554 the representation
###1558 of a phallus. And it's not delicate at all.
###1561 -It won't break. You can hold it. -(LAuGHS) All right. Okay.
###1563 -And if you look at it, the ring... -Yeah.
###1566 NICHOLAS: ...around here, you know, it makes a fairly obvious sexual image.
###1569 (LAuGHING) Yeah.
###1570 Yeah, one could, you know, easily imagine using it in
###1574 -ritual functions, or also... -Yeah.
###1578 ...you know, straight sexual functions in one form or another.
###1581 So do you think this is the first archaeological evidence of smut?
###1585 (BOTH CHuCKLE)
###1587 I don't know. I wouldn't rule that out.
###1589 (BOTH LAuGH)
###1591 I can't believe it. I'm an anatomist and you've made me blush
###1593 with a bit of prehistoric phallic imagery.
###1597 ROBERTS: It seems our ancestors were more like us than we might imagine.
###1605 But this doesn't really answer my question.
###1608 After all, what use is a flute against a Neanderthal?
###1621 Nicholas takes me to see the cave where the artefacts were found.
###1629 Our ancestors weren't the only people who lived here.
###1635 This is the famous southwest entrance of the cave.
###1639 This is actually very close to where the human remains remained,
###1642 but there were definitely Neanderthals here.
###1644 There are a number of deposits in the lower sediments
###1648 made by Neanderthals. So Neanderthals and modern humans
###1650 were definitely both here at Fuldevert, which is...
###1652 ROBERTS: Both using these caves?
###1654 Both using this cave,
###1655 but also using a number of other caves in the Lohne valley where we are.
###1666 ROBERTS: Many beautiful objects have been found in this region.
###1672 Made by our ancestors,
###1673 they reveal a crucial difference between us and Neanderthals.
###1681 this figure of a lion man
###1683 was made around 35,000 years ago.
###1686 But it's not a one-off.
###1689 Other strikingly similar pieces
###1691 have been found in the region.
###1696 What's going on here?
###1702 The modern humans, here, and for instance in the neighbouring valley
###1705 make the exact same artefacts and they are definitely part of the same group.
###1709 There's no way that it's chance that you get identical artefacts
###1713 at sites, you know, 20, 30, 40 kilometres away.
###1715 And that tells us that populations with a shared identity
###1719 were fairly large, covering fairly large areas.
###1722 presumably interacting, mating with one another, helping each other,
###1726 and Neanderthals don't seem to have had that kind of symbolic communication
###1730 and seem to have maintained smaller social networks than modern humans.
###1736 ROBERTS: So it seems that, unlike Neanderthals,
###1739 the scattered tribes of our ancestors were held together
###1743 by a strong shared identity.
###1753 The great flowering of art suggests
###1756 that people were reaching out to each other across the landscape
###1761 in a way they'd never done before.
###1763 Art wasn't just something they were doing in their spare time.
###1767 It was crucial to survival,
###1770 a way of marking territory and identity.
###1773 A bit like national flags or football shirts today.
###1777 And in that competition with the Neanderthals,
###1780 it seems that art and what it stood for may have given us the edge.
###1790 these links between family groups may have been critical to our success.
###1800 And as we advanced, Neanderthals began to retreat...
###1806 to the very edge of the continent.
###1817 I'm heading to what may have been the last-ever Neanderthal colony.
###1826 And I'm hoping to discover why they finally died out.
###1847 I'm in Gibraltar, a naval stronghold for centuries,
###1851 and new evidence from these rocky shores suggests
###1855 that thousands of years after they disappeared from the rest of Europe,
###1859 the Neanderthals were clinging on here.
###1863 When Neanderthals lived here, sea levels were up to a hundred metres lower,
###1869 so much of the evidence from that time could be underwater.
###1877 A team of specialists is probing the ocean floor looking for traces
###1882 of the Gibraltar Neanderthals.
###1887 We've come to a stop now because we are over the archaeological site.
###1891 It's about 20 metres below the surface of the sea below us.
###1895 The divers are all getting ready,
###1897 and these are divers but also archaeologists, so they're going to be
###1900 excavating the sea bottom in search of Neanderthals.
###1909 these divers are up against poor visibility
###1913 with a limited oxygen supply.
###1915 Underwater archaeology is always challenging.
###1922 But clive Finlayson has already made a series of significant discoveries
###1928 in the sea caves nearby.
###1931 CLIvE: This is where the last Neanderthals made their last stand,
###1933 if you like, 24,000 years ago.
###1940 We get the feeling it's the nearest thing to a Neanderthal city
###1942 you're gonna find anywhere.
###1944 We've got fossils, stone tools, animals that they've been butchering,
###1948 all kinds of evidence, hearths, Neanderthal barbecues if you like.
###1951 It's a very, very special site.
###1961 ROBERTS: they think that Neanderthals may have held on here
###1964 long after they'd been wiped out in the rest of Europe.
###1973 But after the Neanderthals finally disappeared from Gibraltar,
###1977 there was a gap of 5,000 years before we turned up.
###1985 So it looks as though whatever finally killed Neanderthals off,
###1990 it wasn't us.
###1994 What do you think eventually wiped them out?
###1998 It may have been a numbers game - there were so few left.
###2000 As would happen to populations of endangered species today,
###2003 like the panda or the tiger.
###2005 Just random fluctuation in numbers can bring it down to zero,
###2008 and there's no recovery from zero, so it could've been that.
###2010 It could've been disease, in-breeding,
###2013 a whole range of factors that can affect a small population
###2016 and knock them over the edge.
###2018 (BIRDS SQUAWKING)
###2025 I find it very moving to think that one day the last Neanderthal
###2029 might have been sitting here, staring out to sea
###2034 and perhaps waiting for their companions to return.
###2037 Or maybe he or she knew that they were the last of their tribe or their family.
###2042 But they can't have known that they were the last
###2045 of their entire species.
###2052 So that was the end of the Neanderthals.
###2057 Or was it?
###2062 Some scientists believe their descendants
###2065 are still walking around today.
###2070 If our ancestors interbred with them,
###2074 some of us could be part Neanderthal.
###2081 Obviously to Neanderthals, a fine Neanderthal man must have been
###2085 very handsome to a Neanderthal woman.
###2087 And a Neanderthal woman, despite her massive brows and very chunky face,
###2091 must have looked wonderful to a Neanderthal man.
###2095 But I think we look at them and think they look,
###2098 I don't know, yeah, just a bit ugly.
###2101 I don't think it would've even crossed my mind to fancy
###2105 or perhaps mate with a Neanderthal.
###2111 It seems our ancestors felt the same way as me.
###2116 Researchers are now sequencing the Neanderthal genome,
###2120 using DNA from bones tens of thousands of years old,
###2125 and comparing it with our own.
###2129 And so far there's no sign of any interbreeding.
###2135 Neanderthals really did die out,
###2140 and Europe was ours.
###2162 Soon descendants of the first pioneers would be joined by new arrivals.
###2169 About 100% of Europeans living today are descended
###2172 from those ancient pioneers who shared the continent with the Neanderthals.
###2177 But what about the rest of us?
###2178 Well, our genes tell us that after the Neanderthals disappeared
###2182 there was a second big wave of colonisation into Europe,
###2186 and some of us appear to be descended from that wave.
###2192 I'd like to know where I fit in this story.
###2197 I've taken a genetic test.
###2201 Something anyone can do.
###2203 It should be possible for me to find out if I can trace my DNA
###2207 all the way back to Europa,
###2210 or whether my ancestors arrived much later.
###2217 So I've got the results back of my DNA analysis
###2221 and they look extraordinarily complicated,
###2223 even though this is actually only a tiny fragment of my genetic code.
###2228 And I've also got the genetic code for Europe's first lady, Europa,
###2233 here in front of me, so I can compare our DNA sequences.
###2240 At first sight we seem identical.
###2251 But when you look really carefully,
###2253 there are some differences.
###2255 they may be tiny, but they're crucial.
###2262 So this means I'm not descended from Europa.
###2265 And in fact these mutations tell me that I'm descended
###2271 from another European founding mother.
###2279 Some have called this woman Iris,
###2281 and her descendants may have been part of a new wave into Europe
###2286 around 25,000 years ago.
###2292 People that seem to have come from the east,
###2295 bringing a new culture with them.
###2305 I've come to the Czech Republic,
###2309 to the small village of Doln/' Vestonice,
###2312 famous for some big archaeological discoveries.
###2318 So what do they reveal about this new culture?
###2330 ROBERTS: Oh, that's beautiful.
###2331 So, we've got several tusks like this in Central and Eastern Europe
###2336 which always have a very complex type of engraving.
###2340 And one thing that could be suggested
###2343 is that this thing could be a meandering river.
###2347 ROBERTS: Right.
###2348 The way how the tusk is decorated could have had some sort of a meaning,
###2354 like accessibility of the field or good for hunting, bad for hunting,
###2358 you can push mammoth through or you cannot.
###2362 -ROBERTS: So it's a map? -A kind of a map.
###2364 And the whole strategy of an action could be planned
###2368 on a piece of ivory like that.
###2376 ROBERTS: We'll never know for sure if it was a map.
###2380 But other artefacts found here are much more significant.
###2389 this is the Venus of Doln/' Vestonice.
###2393 One of the earliest pieces of pottery in the world.
###2406 But the really exciting thing is that other Venus figurines
###2410 have been unearthed all over the continent.
###2418 What this means is that for the first time
###2422 people shared a distinct culture right across Europe.
###2429 But in the next few thousand years
###2432 our European ancestors would face a threat
###2435 that would almost wipe them out.
###2439 (THuNDERCLAP)
###2443 ROBERTS: Europe was about to experience devastating climate change.
###2448 the peak of the Ice Age.
###2453 Animals disappeared from the landscape and the ground froze over.
###2459 Our ancestors couldn't survive in these Arctic conditions.
###2469 By 24,000 years ago, Britain was uninhabitable,
###2475 covered in ice half a mile thick.
###2478 (WIND BLOWING)
###2483 And still the ice sheets pushed further south,
###2488 squeezing life from the land and almost wiping out
###2493 our ancestors in Europe.
###2499 This is the vezere valley in the Dordogne.
###2503 During the last Ice Age, the hills around here
###2505 would have been bound tight by frost.
###2508 And with wind chill, the temperature up there
###2511 could be as much as 20 degrees colder than down here in the valley,
###2515 where a warmish micro-climate meant life could go on,
###2520 and small bands of hunter-gatherers would've huddled together
###2523 to survive the long, bitter winters.
###2532 But they may not have survived at all, had it not been for this...
###2540 the rock shelters and caves that riddle the landscape.
###2548 And deep underground, they left something that we still marvel at today.
###2555 (WATER DRIPPING)
###2587 I'm in a cave called pech Merle, which is stunningly beautiful naturally,
###2592 but look at this - this is real artistic expression.
###2596 Something that defines us and sets us apart as a species.
###2601 And pech Merle is unusual,
###2603 because artists were coming here to paint these images
###2606 both before and after the peak of the last Ice Age,
###2610 generations of them returning to the cave
###2613 as the world outside froze over.
###2619 This is a very beautiful image and it uses the contours of the rock.
###2625 The horse's back sort of curves along a bulge in the rock
###2629 and there's an echo of the horse's head on this right side there.
###2633 And it's obviously a very stylised horse as well.
###2636 And I love the way those spots carry on into the background,
###2639 as though the horse is sort of camouflaged against the rock.
###2644 And there's a hand placed against the rock just above the horse's back.
###2648 I mean, that is amazing, isn't it? That's an Ice Age hand.
###2651 (SpUTTERING)
###2657 Michel Lorblanchet has devoted his life to studying the art found in caves
###2663 like Pech Merle.
###2664 (SpUTTERING)
###2675 I think I naively imagined that you just take a mouthful of charcoal,
###2679 a bit of water and just spit it at the wall and that'd be it.
###2682 But of course all that would happen would be that the mess
###2684 would run down the wall and obscure the stencil that you were trying to do.
###2688 So you have to do it like this, using an almost dry mouth,
###2692 and just building it up very gradually with a fine spray.
###2703 Michel Lorblanchet did a recreation of the horses at pech Merle
###2707 using this technique. It took him a whole week.
###2710 -Is it finished? -Yes...
###2712 -It's finished. -Yes. That's right.
###2715 ROBERTS: But what drove these people, struggling just to survive, to paint?
###2721 The vast majority of these images seem to be animals,
###2725 there don't seem to be many representations of humans.
###2728 No, that's true, they are mainly animal figures.
###2732 And for them, of course, animals were not only game,
###2738 but also spirits, symbolic,
###2741 so the animal figures are, in fact, symbolic figures.
###2745 And going into pech Merle, I mean, it's such a beautiful cave
###2749 with all the stalactites hanging down
###2751 and it does feel as though it was, I don't know, almost a temple.
###2756 Yes, that's right, this is a natural temple, if you like.
###2759 They are sacred sites.
###2761 They are not painting just for fun.
###2764 By painting a cave and having a sanctuary,
###2768 it is a way for them to say, ''Here is our sacred place.''
###2775 The painted cave is symbolic of the whole tribe.
###2782 ROBERTS: Being bound together in this way
###2785 may have helped our ancestors survive
###2788 the kind of climate change that only haunts our imaginations today.
###2796 (WIND BLOWING)
###2800 Nearly two thirds of modern Europeans can trace their lineages back
###2805 to ancestors who held on in those southern refuges.
###2815 It would be more than 1 00 generations
###2818 before the world would begin to warm again.
###2827 And it may have been around this time that something happened
###2831 which would stamp a new identity on the Europeans.
###2835 Since the birth of our species in Africa,
###2838 our ancestors' skin had almost certainly been dark,
###2842 protection against the tropical sun.
###2846 But why in Europe did it turn from brown to white?
###2854 the surprising answer may lie with a single vitamin.
###2859 Vitamin D.
###2862 A lack of vitamin D may not sound particularly significant,
###2865 but it can be life-threatening.
###2868 It can wreak havoc with a growing skeleton,
###2870 causing bones to grow bent and misshapen.
###2874 These are all skeletons of patients with rickets,
###2877 and you can see how it's affected the bones.
###2880 These leg bones here are all curved, making walking difficult.
###2885 And the chest is deformed, so breathing would be problematic as well.
###2889 And not only that, rickets can affect your chance of having children.
###2894 This is the pelvis of a woman who had rickets.
###2897 And you can see the way that the pelvic bones have collapsed together.
###2901 You just could not get a baby's head through this space.
###2905 It would've been impossible for her to give birth naturally.
###2912 So vitamin D is vital
###2915 and we make it in our skin in the presence of sunlight.
###2920 But dark skin blocks out the sun,
###2922 and in Europe, with its weaker sunlight, this could've been a problem.
###2927 Our ancestors may have struggled to make enough vitamin D.
###2932 So this could be why Europeans turned white.
###2945 But this change in skin colour was nothing
###2948 compared with the massive upheaval approaching.
###2958 I'm heading back to turkey,
###2960 because a recent discovery here shows that after the Ice Age,
###2965 our ancestors abandoned their way of life,
###2969 one they had followed since our species first appeared in Africa.
###2978 And what happened here still defines our world today.
###2992 this final stage of my European journey leads to a remote hillside
###2998 in the far south of the country.
###3004 This is Gobekli Tepe,
###3007 an extraordinary site that I'm just incredibly excited to look at.
###3016 Hi. Alice.
###3018 -Are you Klaus Schmidt? -Nice to meet you.
###3019 Hello. I'm Alice Roberts.
###3020 (LAuGHS) I heard from your visit. Yeah.
###3022 Nice to meet you here in Gobekli Tepe.
###3024 I'm so excited about coming here.
###3026 It's such an amazing discovery you've made.
###3028 It's amazing, that's true, that's very true.
###3030 -You seem very excited. -I just this season
###3032 we have a lot of new findings.
###3033 -So it's worth to have a look. -Oh, come on then, let's have a look.
###3053 ROBERTS: Gobekli tepe is 12,000 years old,
###3057 over twice as old as the pyramids.
###3063 Already, Klaus has found dozens of standing stones,
###3069 each one carved with mysterious symbols.
###3077 these stone circles are possibly the oldest purpose-built temples
###3082 in the world.
###3091 KLAuS: Sometimes, there are arms and hands and fingers depicted.
###3096 So it's very clear that the T part is a human head in profile
###3101 and the shaft of the pillar is the human body.
###3105 Here we have an example of the depiction of an arm
###3109 which is going down here, and the fingers.
###3111 The hand and the fingers are not excavated yet,
###3114 but it's clear they will appear when we continue to work here.
###3118 So we've got a circle of smaller T-shaped pillars
###3122 and then two enormous ones in the centre.
###3124 It's always the same, there are two in the centre which are very big
###3127 and free-standing, surrounded by smaller but similar ones.
###3131 And we understand it as a meeting,
###3133 as a gathering of these beings made of stone.
###3145 Here now, we have the most interesting reliefs.
###3148 ROBERTS: Oh, wow.
###3149 KLAuS: Ibis, snake and a vulture.
###3153 It's a story illustrated by these animals,
###3156 and this story is not a peaceful one.
###3158 A scorpion, snake, and so on.
###3160 Our model for the function of all this installation is
###3163 they have been made for burial reasons.
###3166 To bring the dead bodies to open places
###3170 and the vultures are eating the flesh and other birds.
###3173 So you think this might have been a site for these sky burials?
###3176 -KLAuS: Yes, yes... -Where people are left out in the open
###3178 to be picked clean by vultures.
###3180 -KLAuS: Yes... -And these are the vultures?
###3181 KLAuS: (LAuGHS) These are the vultures, yeah.
###3183 ROBERTS: It almost looks like hieroglyphics.
###3185 Maybe pre-hieroglyphic messages or Stone Age hieroglyphics.
###3194 ROBERTS: Klaus is anxious to show me his most spectacular discovery.
###3198 KLAuS: And here we found...
###3200 (ROBERTS EXCLAIMS)
###3201 ...this nice animal.
###3203 This is incredibly beautiful, I mean, this is sculpture.
###3206 -It's not just a relief, is it? -Yeah, yeah, sure.
###3208 ROBERTS: It's wonderful. KLAuS: Yes, clearly,
###3209 it's a masterpiece of work.
###3212 ROBERTS: It makes you rethink the Stone Age, doesn't it? I mean, it...
###3216 You tend to think of hunter-gatherers as being, I don't know,
###3219 fairly crude in some ways,
###3221 and not necessarily capable of producing artefacts that beautiful.
###3226 It's clear that these societies had specialists
###3230 for stone-working, at least.
###3231 So, really, people who didn't do anything else, as to produce sculptures
###3235 and pillars and reliefs from stone.
###3237 These are such exciting finds, aren't they?
###3239 KLAuS: Yeah.
###3243 ROBERTS: this place suggests a society that could support specialist craftsmen
###3248 and perhaps even a priesthood.
###3253 It was the beginning of a totally new way of life.
###3256 KLAuS: These are sites of settled hunters.
###3258 So it was a high culture of hunters here,
###3261 which was nearly exploding in the tenth millennium,
###3265 so it's still a hunter-gatherer society in its structures,
###3268 and its buildings, its monuments.
###3270 ROBERTS: But there was another very important difference
###3273 between these hunter-gatherers and any of their predecessors.
###3277 they were settling down, abandoning their nomadic lifestyle.
###3283 A huge shift, which would help spark a Europe-wide revolution.
###3290 And the evidence for this can be found growing in the surrounding fields.
###3299 Locked inside this single stalk of wheat
###3303 is a story of how the world was transformed.
###3307 Geneticists have analysed DNA from domesticated wheat varieties
###3312 from across the world, and the staggering thing is
###3315 they can all be traced back to grasses which originally grew in this area.
###3325 Which means that farming as we know it in Europe was born around here.
###3332 communities settled down and populations expanded.
###3336 this could've driven the need to start producing food.
###3342 And as farming spread, the landscape was transformed.
###3350 Forests were cleared and villages, then towns,
###3355 then cities would grow,
###3359 founded by descendants of the small groups of pioneers
###3363 who first entered Europe around 45,000 years ago.
###3371 those early Europeans were people just like you and me.
###3376 But it is humbling when you see the challenges they faced.
###3384 they overcame the competition from Neanderthals
###3389 and made it through the Ice Age.
###3394 In fact, at the time it wasn't at all inevitable
###3398 that my ancestors, maybe yours, would've even survived.
###3402 And it makes me wonder what would happen if today's Europeans
###3406 were faced by such a harsh changing climate.
###3410 But having taken this long view,
###3412 we've seen how ingenious and adaptable we are as a species.
###3416 And it gives me hope that we will be able to survive the changes
###3420 of millennia to come.
