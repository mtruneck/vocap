###2 Hi, I'm Sharon Long,
###4 from Stanford University.
###5 I'm here today to tell you about some remarkable organisms,
###9 two kinds of organisms in fact, bacteria and plants.
###13 Together, they can do something that neither can do alone:
###16 They can bring nitrogen, in its molecular form,
###19 which is usually very inert,
###21 they can bring that nitrogen into a chemically combined form
###25 that can be used for protein nutrition.
###28 So, I'll have three topics overall.
###30 First, I'd like to give you an introduction to the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis,
###36 in particular, between Rhizobium and legumes.
###40 I'd then like to focus, in my second segment,
###42 on the bacterial genes that are used for the response to the plant,
###46 and for the bacteria to be able to provoke the plant,
###49 in order to make the home for the bacteria, once they invade.
###55 And in the final segment, I'd like to tell you some of our new research
###58 on how the plant responds to the signals
###61 that come from the bacteria.
###63 So now, in the first segment, as I mentioned,
###66 we have an overview. I'm going to tell you about
###68 something called "root nodules" and how these
###70 root nodules form and how they work.
###75 To get us started, I'd like to address a subject
###77 near and dear to all our hearts, and that is food.
###80 When we think about food, we're aware of the need for balance.
###83 We need carbohydrates, fats, proteins.
###87 And proteins, it turns out, are a particular issue in nutrition,
###92 because proteins, unlike carbohydrates and fats
###95 for the most part, require a great deal of nitrogen,
###98 and nitrogen is scarce.
###101 That means that protein malnutrition, the inability to get enough protein,
###106 can happen whenever agriculture is deficient or when yields are low,
###112 and it's one of the most devastating problems
###114 for human health worldwide. So, in Western cultures,
###119 when we think about getting protein, we may think,
###122 well, I need to have a protein-rich food.
###125 Something, which we're going to remember, has a lot of nitrogen.
###129 We're going to think about, for example, some poultry.
###131 And here they are, poultry, a very protein-rich food.
###136 Now, we're thinking about the theme of nitrogen, it's a critical element.
###141 Where did these animals get their nitrogen
###143 so that they can make protein? They get it from plants.
###146 And ultimately, of course, whether we eat meat or eat plants,
###151 all human protein ultimately comes from plants.
###156 So that raises the question, where do the plants get their nitrogen?
###159 The answer is, they get from the soil.
###161 Soils include compounds such as nitrates;
###164 they will include organic nitrogen, which might be provided
###168 from manure or decomposition of plant matter.
###172 And the plants will take up this nitrogen,
###174 they will synthesize amino acids from the soil nitrogen,
###178 and from those, they make proteins,
###181 and then we in turn can get our protein from those plants.
###185 However, if a field is used over and over again,
###188 ultimately it becomes depleted for nitrogen.
###190 And that means that this infertile soil is not able
###194 to support plant yield or plant nitrogen.
###199 Now how do we overcome that?
###201 At large scales of agriculture, when fields are used quite often,
###206 then the soil the soil can be restored by applications
###210 of nitrogen fertilizer, it's usually in the form of ammonium.
###213 Now, ammonium, remarkably, can actually be made from
###217 molecular nitrogen, which is in the air, which is very abundant.
###221 That you may know: The vast majority of the atmosphere is made of nitrogen.
###225 But it's incredibly inert.
###227 It won't combine with anything, this triple-bond nitrogen.
###231 So, in order to coax that nitrogen into a combined form of ammonium,
###237 there's a process called the Haber-Bosch process,
###240 which is able to take molecule nitrogen,
###244 combine it with hydrogen gas at very high temperature,
###248 very high pressure, with a metal catalyst, and convert it to ammonium.
###252 That ammonium can then be applied on a field.
###256 The plants will take up the ammonium, they will make protein,
###258 and the yield is therefore supported.
###263 But the problem is this:
###265 How do we get high temperature and pressure? It's by using fossil fuels.
###271 It's mostly natural gas, but other fossil fuels can be used,
###275 and we're all aware of the scarcity and the price of fossil fuels,
###280 and what lies in the future for their availability.
###284 That means that we can't necessarily depend on
###288 unlimited supplies of this kind of ammonium fertilizer.
###294 Are there alternatives? And it turns out, for millennia,
###298 farmers in every continent of the world have known of another way.
###303 That is the use of legumes, a very special group of plants.
###307 It's a plant family, the Leguminosae, also called Fabaceae,
###312 the third largest family in the angiosperms, or flowering plants.
###316 Legumes have this remarkable property that they can associate
###320 with bacteria from the soil, they can grow a
###324 new organ called a root nodule.
###327 The bacteria live inside the root nodule, and once the bacteria are there,
###331 the bacteria are converting nitrogen into ammonia through an enzyme.
###338 This is still energy-intensive.
###341 As biochemists, we wouldn't see that it uses highly reduced electrons
###346 and a lot of ATP, but is that coming from?
###349 It's coming from sunlight.
###351 So, the advantage of this is that we're able to nourish plants,
###357 and those plants then in turn can nourish the soil,
###361 in a process that uses a biological catalyst at room temperature,
###365 at ordinary pressure, and uses sunlight to drive it.
###371 Now, as I mentioned, farmers throughout the ancient world
###376 knew about this. They didn't know why it happened,
###379 but they could see that the use of legumes in agriculture to rotate,
###386 or to use as a green manure, would assure the fertility of their soil.
###391 In the New World, farmers used the common bean,
###395 which is a New World plant. In the Mediterranean, they used lupins.
###399 In China, they used soybean. And in South Asia and Africa, the cow pea.
###405 So again, throughout the world,
###407 crop rotation has been used as a key element of sustainable agriculture.
###413 So from that view of real nodules,
###416 I'd like to draw back just a moment for a cartoon,
###418 so that I can describe this in a more simplified way.
###423 We know that we're talking about legumes and the way
###427 in which they form a symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
###430 And one of the key elements of this
###432 is that it's able to be used to replace nitrogen fertilizer.
###436 How does this happen? So, in a schematic form,
###442 we can imagine that there are these bacteria, the Rhizobium bacteria,
###445 that grow in the soil.
###446 They're able to grow slowly as saprophytes,
###449 just scavenging nutrients from the soil.
###452 And here's a plant, which, again, could grow if there's fertilizer.
###456 But in the absence, it's going to have a hard time.
###460 So, if we've got the right bacteria and plant,
###463 and I'm going to talk to about that specificity again in a few minutes,
###467 they interact to form these:
###468 What's shown here in red are root nodules,
###472 specialized organs that grow on the root,
###474 within which the bacteria are able to fix nitrogen.
###481 So, this is where it's all happening. I love this!
###486 These are nodules, they're growing on a soybean plant,
###489 so you can see some of the nodules here,
###491 the growths that are occurring on the root.
###494 The plant is up there, and the nodules,
###498 once they fix nitrogen and make amino acids,
###501 the plant is able to take those amino acids, put it up in the shoot,
###505 where it can make chlorophyll, where it can make proteins,
###509 and ultimately, to make high-protein seeds.
###514 Now I'd like to make several points about this.
###517 First, the bacteria in these nodules are fixing nitrogen,
###522 but even that is energy intensive.
###525 And as I mentioned, ultimately, it's sunlight, through photosynthesis,
###530 that allows the plant to support this energy-intensive process
###533 of nitrogen fixation. It's occurring only in the root nodules,
###537 it doesn't occur anywhere else in the plant.
###540 This association is highly specific,
###543 and I'll show you that in a moment with a table.
###546 It's also established through a complex developmental process,
###549 and I'll show you some microscopic views of that.
###554 And remarkably, this process is restricted,
###560 with one known exception only, in the world.
###563 It's restricted to one family, the legume family.
###567 We know a little bit about why that occurs,
###570 but there's a lot left to find out.
###574 The legumes I've mentioned are part of the large family,
###579 which includes both agriculturally important
###581 and environmentally important species.
###584 When we think of high-protein plants, many of the plants
###588 that come to mind are in fact the legumes.
###594 Both in terms of their seed content and in terms of the content of their leaves.
###599 We're familiar with the soybean, cow pea,
###603 common bean, all being high-protein seeds.
###606 The pea, again, a high-protein seed.
###609 Also, alfalfa, which is used as a forage for animals,
###613 it has very high-protein leaves.
###615 That's why it's so nourishing for animals such as cattle and horses.
###620 But beyond the uses for human nutrition, these plants
###626 are very important in many natural ecosystems throughout the world.
###630 We might think, for example, of this acacia
###633 growing up in the African plain.
###636 Or we could think of this mesquite tree,
###639 let me show you this one over here.
###642 And here, a broom plant, a shrub.
###645 These legume shrubs and trees often grow
###649 in relatively harsh environments, where they provide nutrition
###652 for the soil that's around them.
###655 So, coming back to the development process,
###660 what we want to know is how is it that those incredibly diverse
###665 groups of plants are able to establish the association
###671 with Rhizobium, and why don't other plants do it?
###675 So, I'd now like to tell you a little bit about the specificity.
###681 Beyond the specificity for the legume family,
###685 within that very diverse family, specific legume types,
###689 such as the soybean, are nodulated not just by any old bacterium,
###694 but only by certain restricted groups.
###697 So here we're looking at the soybean,
###699 and here I'm showing you two different species that are known
###702 to form symbiotic root nodules on soybean.
###705 Here we have the pea. It's a legume also,
###708 but its nodulating bacterium is a different one:
###711 Rhizobium leguminosarum.
###713 I'll have occasion to mention pea and Rhizobium leguminosarum
###716 in the second half of my introduction.
###719 Here we have a lotus plant called trefoil,
###723 and it's nodulated by a different genus, Mesorhizobium, species loti.
###728 And the system that I study,
###729 which is the genus Medicago, which includes alfalfa,
###733 and which is nodulated by Sinorhizobium meliloti.
###737 This is the species you'll hear about,
###739 in terms of the direct experiments that I describe,
###742 through the rest of my talk, with the one comparison
###744 that I've mentioned earlier.
###747 Now, I've told you that nodule development is complex,
###752 but I haven't really shown you what I mean.
###754 And so that's what we want to do next.
###756 In looking at this, the primary approach that I'll tell you is through microscopy,
###763 but embedded in that microscopy,
###766 I'll also tell you a little bit about the physiology.
###770 So, one of the first changes that occurs when Rhizobium meet a plant,
###776 is that the root hairs, which are ordinarily straight,
###779 and here's an example of a fairly normal-looking root hair right here...
###783 instead, root hairs grow in a way that's deformed.
###787 Now don't think of this as root hairs curling.
###790 Plant cells don't curve.
###792 Think of a plant cell as a balloon inflated really hard inside a box.
###797 Plant cells don't curl, but they can grow so that they form a curl,
###801 and that's what happens here.
###803 If you take a look at this root hair, instead of growing straight,
###806 it's grown so that it tops over and makes
###809 what's called a "shepherd's crook" or "crozier."
###812 In that, you can see a bacterial invasion,
###815 which is called an infection thread, and that's shown here
###817 at this highly refractile line going down through the root hair.
###824 Now, at the same time that invasion is occurring on the outside,
###829 early events are also occurring inside the plant root,
###833 so I want you to imagine that the plant root is going out this way.
###836 Now here we have an uninfected plant root,
###839 it's typical plant root cells,
###841 you can see they're very long.
###843 They look "empty," that's because they're mostly filled with vacuoles,
###848 a large vacuole.
###850 Plant root cells, in the cortex here, have one main job:
###856 That is to transport and transport and transport...
###859 water, ions, nutrients, and so forth.
###862 That's what these cells do; they don't divide.
###865 But if the correct Rhizobium, and this is an example of something
###869 that happens only if you have the right species of bacterium and plant...
###872 if the correct Rhizobium is infected onto that plant, you get this.
###877 You can see the mitotic figures happening here,
###880 the cells in the inner cortex of the root have begun to divide.
###885 They're going to form what's called a "primordium."
###890 Those cells continue dividing,
###892 and the infection that started with an infection thread,
###896 continues all the way through into these newly dividing cells.
###900 Here you can see a cell that's just starting to divide.
###904 And what happens is that, if you can follow this arrow,
###908 you can see right here, there is a little, membrane-bound,
###913 kind of an empty-looking vacuole,
###915 and within it, a peach-colored oblong.
###918 That is a single Rhizobium bacterium that's
###921 being taken up into the host cell, and it's being engulfed
###924 by plant plasma membrane that's going to differentiate
###928 and provide a special compartment that the Rhizobium
###933 will be in when it starts to fix nitrogen.
###937 So, the bacteria at this point are released from the infection thread,
###941 and they're bound in plant membrane sacs.
###945 But that doesn't do justice to what's going on.
###948 This bacterium is part of a more elaborate compartment,
###952 and I'm showing that compartment here.
###955 This, shown in orange, is the bacterium.
###960 But you see there's an extra boundary.
###963 There's not just the bacterial membrane, but there's another membrane.
###966 That's referred to as the symbiosome membrane.
###969 It's derived from the plant plasma membrane
###971 that was used to engulf the bacterium when it first entered the host cell.
###976 But at this point, it's become a distinctive compartment,
###980 with its own protein trafficking signals.
###985 I'll just tell you a little bit about the basics of transport.
###989 Of course, this is the real action:
###992 We have nitrogen converted enzymatically into ammonium.
###998 This uses ATP and highly reduced electrons,
###1001 and that ammonium is in turn transported out to the plant.
###1006 As I've mentioned before, the bacterium gets energy from the plant.
###1010 Malate, and other dicarboxylic acids, are transported into the bacterium.
###1015 From there, they enter into the bacteria's own metabolism.
###1019 So, plant photosynthate providing energy,
###1022 bacterial nitrogen fixation providing ammonium.
###1026 That had been suspected for a long time.
###1030 But emerging data from a number of labs shows that there's more going on.
###1034 In fact, genetic data show a shuttle involving
###1038 amino acids that are transported in and out,
###1041 is also critical to sustain nitrogen fixation.
###1045 How this occurs is a subject of a great deal of ongoing research.
###1051 We've got all of these cells, which are packed with bacteria,
###1056 which are fixing nitrogen.
###1057 So inside these cells, we've got ammonia created from molecular nitrogen.
###1065 And over here, you can see the vasculature of the plant,
###1069 so you can imagine that the stem of the root is going to go up like this,
###1075 and the stele, the vascular tissue in the root,
###1078 is going to transport all of those amino acids up to nourish
###1082 the rest of the plant.
###1085 So, I've now shown you in this first part of the overview
###1089 that nodulation occurs by a very complex developmental process.
###1095 It's species-specific, and the events that I showed you
###1098 occur only if the correct Rhizobium and correct plant
###1101 come into combination. Now, in the next segment,
###1104 what I'd like to do is talk about how the bacteria and the plant
###1110 create signals that stimulate each other to
###1113 begin their developmental process.
###1115 And so in that next slide, we're going to ask this question:
###1119 How do plants and bacteria use chemical signals for recognition?
