0:0:10,66 --> 0:0:13,966
>> I remember the day that everything I
understood about soils began to change.


3
0:0:13,966 --> 0:0:17,746
It was the day I met Ray Archuleta.


4
0:0:17,746 --> 0:0:23,686
I wanted to talk to him about no-till equipment,
but he pointed me in a different direction.


5
0:0:23,686 --> 0:0:27,346
>> It is not about the equipment.


6
0:0:27,346 --> 0:0:28,626
It's about the understanding.


7
0:0:28,626 --> 0:0:33,866
The most important thing about it is
understanding how your soil system functions.


8
0:0:33,866 --> 0:0:35,446
That's number one.


9
0:0:35,446 --> 0:0:39,446
>> Now the soil functions that
farmers care about are the supply


10
0:0:39,446 --> 0:0:42,696
of water and nutrients to their crop.


11
0:0:42,696 --> 0:0:48,906
Soil ecologists tell us that 90% of these
functions are dependent on soil biology.


12
0:0:48,906 --> 0:0:51,886
>> There's this movement through the country
where people are realizing, "You know what?


13
0:0:51,886 --> 0:0:56,26
If we farm nature's way,
we start saving on inputs."


14
0:0:56,26 --> 0:0:57,896
Does nature disrupt itself?


15
0:0:57,896 --> 0:1:1,636
It doesn't do that, and if you
can learn the principles --


16
0:1:1,636 --> 0:1:3,396
I call them the keys to the soil health.


17
0:1:3,396 --> 0:1:10,616
It is limit disturbance; cover the soil all
the time with diversity, diversity, diversity;


18
0:1:10,616 --> 0:1:13,146
have a live root growing all the time.


19
0:1:13,146 --> 0:1:14,886
That's what nature does.


20
0:1:14,886 --> 0:1:19,306
>> To be honest, the skeptic inside
of me did not quite believe Ray.


21
0:1:19,306 --> 0:1:25,546
But he began to introduce me to veterans of
this movement, real farmers like Ray Styer,


22
0:1:25,546 --> 0:1:31,256
Gabe and Paul Brown, and Dave Brandt, and
they all seemed to be singing his song.


23
0:1:31,256 --> 0:1:34,306
>> It seems to be that the more
species you have growing together,


24
0:1:34,306 --> 0:1:39,736
the diversity of your cover
crop, the better it is.


25
0:1:39,736 --> 0:1:43,456
>> We have quite the diversity in our cropland.


26
0:1:43,456 --> 0:1:46,786
Twenty-five different species
we've grown this year,


27
0:1:46,786 --> 0:1:50,6
both in cover crop combinations
and for cash crops.


28
0:1:50,6 --> 0:1:54,246
>> Today at this farm, we
have 20 different covers.


29
0:1:54,246 --> 0:1:59,756
We have them in five-way blends, seven-way
blends, eight-way blends, and ten-way blends.


30
0:1:59,756 --> 0:2:3,706
>> It took me a while to realize that
these farmers were imitating nature's way


31
0:2:3,706 --> 0:2:6,446
by using diverse cover crops, and by doing


32
0:2:6,446 --> 0:2:10,526
that they were meeting three
of those four soil health keys.


33
0:2:10,526 --> 0:2:13,986
My "aha" moment happened in
a corn stand in North Dakota.


34
0:2:13,986 --> 0:2:20,46
>> This side did not have
compost, and it did not have tea.


35
0:2:20,46 --> 0:2:23,796
There is no commercial fertilizer on any of it.


36
0:2:23,796 --> 0:2:27,536
This side is running purely off the
energy of last year's cover crop.


37
0:2:27,536 --> 0:2:34,256
These four corn fields are probably
one of the best examples of the power


38
0:2:34,256 --> 0:2:37,756
of diversity that I can show you.


39
0:2:37,756 --> 0:2:40,906
The power of diversity is extremely strong.


40
0:2:40,906 --> 0:2:44,376
Now had we come out here last year
and planted a monoculture out here,


41
0:2:44,376 --> 0:2:47,846
and tried to drive this corn
off of a monoculture,


42
0:2:47,846 --> 0:2:52,76
I suspect this wouldn't look quite like it does.


43
0:2:52,76 --> 0:2:52,756
>> Oh, look at that.


44
0:2:52,756 --> 0:2:58,66
>> Now I could put you to sleep by talking
about a recent paradigm shift in soil science


45
0:2:58,66 --> 0:3:3,76
that will change the face of
agriculture, but I have a better idea.


46
0:3:3,76 --> 0:3:8,466
You see, I met three farmers who saw what I
saw in North Dakota, and they acted on it.


47
0:3:8,466 --> 0:3:12,516
And that started a small
revolution in their home county.


48
0:3:12,516 --> 0:3:16,516
This is the story of their rookie
years in diverse cover crops.

I have somewheres in the
850-acre range of cotton.

>> We raise a lot of corn for cutting purposes.


62
0:4:24,36 --> 0:4:27,96
>> Possibly this year we
might grow some popcorn.


63
0:4:27,96 --> 0:4:31,456
It's been since the late '60 early
'70's we've been no-tilling here.

complete no-till system.

>> We've been no-tilling in the neighborhood
of 35 years, and we like no-tilling.


67
0:4:42,186 --> 0:4:43,866
It saves us a lot of time.


68
0:4:43,866 --> 0:4:46,166
We can get over to ground faster.


69
0:4:46,166 --> 0:4:47,616
We feel that's the way to go.


70
0:4:47,616 --> 0:4:50,276
You know, we got to save every bit of
moisture because we don't never know


71
0:4:50,276 --> 0:4:52,346
when the dry spell's going to hit us.


72
0:4:52,346 --> 0:4:55,516
And all our acres were dryland
acres; no irrigation.

0:4:55,516 --> 0:5:11,96
[ Music ]


74
0:5:11,96 --> 0:5:15,736
>> My sense is that most farmers viewed
cover crops as an erosion control measure.


75
0:5:15,736 --> 0:5:22,636
Nice, but expensive, and a
hassle, and certainly not an asset.


76
0:5:22,636 --> 0:5:26,896
>> We used the cover crops behind
low residue producing crops.


77
0:5:26,896 --> 0:5:30,896
A lot of time, wheat was used just
because it was so readily available,


78
0:5:30,896 --> 0:5:35,26
a little bit of oats, some Triticale, some rye.


79
0:5:35,26 --> 0:5:39,716
>> We've been growing cover crops
for several years now, off and on,


80
0:5:39,716 --> 0:5:44,316
but we weren't quite getting what we felt
like we needed as far as the right kind


81
0:5:44,316 --> 0:5:47,246
of mix and the right kind of cover.


82
0:5:47,246 --> 0:5:53,506
It was either getting it all rye or
too much -- too much of one thing.


83
0:5:53,506 --> 0:5:57,596
>> We always saw the opportunity that we
could include something to these cover crops


84
0:5:57,596 --> 0:6:2,86
to help get us some additional
nutrients for our next crop.


85
0:6:2,86 --> 0:6:7,616
But in years past, inputs were relatively
cheap -- I'm not going to say cheap,


86
0:6:7,616 --> 0:6:15,116
but you could afford to buy them so that
opportunity was never really sought out.


87
0:6:15,116 --> 0:6:19,496
>> But things began to change,
especially around 2008.


88
0:6:19,496 --> 0:6:24,246
>> Well, it's a known fact, with
fuel going to $4.00 to $5.00,


89
0:6:24,246 --> 0:6:30,96
we're seeing higher fertilizer cost, and any
way that we could shave off some of the expense


90
0:6:30,96 --> 0:6:33,416
of some of the fertilizer, we're
going to have to find those ways.


91
0:6:33,416 --> 0:6:38,406
>> This meant that these hard-nosed businessmen
became more receptive to the new paradigm


92
0:6:38,406 --> 0:6:44,26
that views soils as ecosystems rather
than black boxes or chemistry sets.


93
0:6:44,26 --> 0:6:50,416
>> I sat through Ray's meeting at the Ag
Civic Center down here in Stanly County.


94
0:6:50,416 --> 0:6:52,856
>> Ah, now we're getting to it.


95
0:6:52,856 --> 0:6:55,406
Oh, my goodness; it's the soil biology.


96
0:6:55,406 --> 0:7:0,576
You mean those little arthropods,
the bacteria, the fungus,


97
0:7:0,576 --> 0:7:4,796
all these critters make organic matter.


98
0:7:4,796 --> 0:7:9,156
Oh, by the way, you can't have the
soil biology without the plants,


99
0:7:9,156 --> 0:7:11,886
and the plants need the microbes.


100
0:7:11,886 --> 0:7:13,66
Doesn't the soil look beautiful?


101
0:7:13,66 --> 0:7:15,606
Who would have thought the soil
would look something like that?


102
0:7:15,606 --> 0:7:23,656
Our job, landowners, is to manage that habitat
right here, that pore space, and keep it intact.


103
0:7:23,656 --> 0:7:28,16
>> My first impression of Ray, I
thought, "Boy, this man's crazy."


104
0:7:28,16 --> 0:7:33,696
But the more I listened to him, I decided
he'd probably forgot more than I'll ever know


105
0:7:33,696 --> 0:7:40,116
about cover crops, and then he asked me and
John to go with him out to North Dakota.


106
0:7:40,116 --> 0:7:42,346
>> When I went to North Dakota,
it was real eye opening


107
0:7:42,346 --> 0:7:45,756
because those guys are working
with limited moisture.


108
0:7:45,756 --> 0:7:49,756
They're looking at 12 inches of
actual rainfall throughout a year,


109
0:7:49,756 --> 0:7:53,726
and they were growing some good
crops with that kind of moisture.


110
0:7:53,726 --> 0:7:57,226
And the only way you're going to be able
to grow crops is conserve your moisture.


111
0:7:57,226 --> 0:8:0,386
Why wouldn't it work when
we're in an area that's --


112
0:8:0,386 --> 0:8:3,306
in a normal year we have 40 inches of rain?


113
0:8:3,306 --> 0:8:10,486
But my deal is I want to drought-proof
the ground as good as I can.


114
0:8:10,486 --> 0:8:14,796
>> With the expense I've already had
with cover crops, and going out there


115
0:8:14,796 --> 0:8:19,256
and seeing what they have done, just, you
know, I thought, "There ain't no excuse


116
0:8:19,256 --> 0:8:21,866
that we can't use this in North Carolina."


117
0:8:21,866 --> 0:8:28,356
>> As far as Curtis and John were
concerned, there was not a moment to be lost.


118
0:8:28,356 --> 0:8:34,666
>> That was the first of September, and
actually, we needed to be planting three weeks


119
0:8:34,666 --> 0:8:37,836
from that so we had to go ahead
and get our seeds lined up.


120
0:8:37,836 --> 0:8:40,866
>> Of course, me and Ray and
John got separated at the airport


121
0:8:40,866 --> 0:8:43,536
because our flights were different.


122
0:8:43,536 --> 0:8:46,866
I sat down and figured out how
many acres I was going to have,


123
0:8:46,866 --> 0:8:48,576
and what I needed, and called home.


124
0:8:48,576 --> 0:8:52,376
And I had the seed ordered before I
got home from North Dakota that year.


125
0:8:52,376 --> 0:8:54,926
>> We got the seeds lined up, and
we had a good stand last year.


126
0:8:54,926 --> 0:8:56,516
We had a heck of a cover crop.

0:9:18,426 --> 0:9:19,696

a lot of cover last year.

0:9:29,366 --> 0:9:31,566
>> Of course, that's not the only mix.


137
0:9:31,566 --> 0:9:36,306
Farmers across the country have become very
creative in the way they introduce diversity


138
0:9:36,306 --> 0:9:42,586
into their land, based on their resource
needs, the season, and the crop rotation.


139
0:9:42,586 --> 0:9:47,66
Now when it comes to planting cover
crops, I'm going to go with the advice


140
0:9:47,66 --> 0:9:50,416
that Dave Brandt gives to his fellow farmers.


141
0:9:50,416 --> 0:9:53,326
>> I think sometimes we tend
to worry too much about it.


142
0:9:53,326 --> 0:9:57,406
You know, I think we try to be too professional
because we're trying to worry about corn


143
0:9:57,406 --> 0:9:59,746
and beans, and making sure everything's right.


144
0:9:59,746 --> 0:10:2,996
Well, the opinion I have on cover
crops is if you've got good weather


145
0:10:2,996 --> 0:10:5,876
and decent soil conditions,
just get it out there.


146
0:10:5,876 --> 0:10:9,556
It seems to grow whether it comes out of
an airplane, or of a spinner spreader,


147
0:10:9,556 --> 0:10:13,406
or of a drill or a planter -- so
I guess there's no magic formula.


148
0:10:13,406 --> 0:10:17,546
Just get it done and get it out there.


149
0:10:17,546 --> 0:10:21,766
>> In our situation, we've actually
broadcasted these cover crops,


150
0:10:21,766 --> 0:10:26,856
just using a traditional three-point hitch
spreader, and have been successful in doing


151
0:10:26,856 --> 0:10:30,996
that on a smaller scale in our operation.


152
0:10:30,996 --> 0:10:38,726
>> The first year we did it we used John's
sprayer and sprayed and used a spin spreader,


153
0:10:38,726 --> 0:10:41,586
but for some reason we got streaks in it.


154
0:10:41,586 --> 0:10:51,546
We're not sure what happened there, but in
the fall of 2011 we defoliated the cotton


155
0:10:51,546 --> 0:10:56,846
with one sprayer, and then took the boom off the
other, and put a pendulum back and forth motion


156
0:10:56,846 --> 0:11:3,236
to spreader on, and that seemed to work great.


157
0:11:3,236 --> 0:11:6,386
>> We decided this fall we did not broadcast.


158
0:11:6,386 --> 0:11:9,946
We put 800 acres in the ground
this year with the drill.


159
0:11:9,946 --> 0:11:12,226
But it's also according to how your seasons run.


160
0:11:12,226 --> 0:11:17,266
I mean, the guys that maybe throwed it out
broadcast it this fall, we had plenty of rain


161
0:11:17,266 --> 0:11:21,226
in the fall which that was a big
help on the broadcasting side.


162
0:11:21,226 --> 0:11:25,266
In fact, there were some days that we
couldn't run because it was too wet,


163
0:11:25,266 --> 0:11:29,686
so we did hold off a few days
of planting because of rain.


164
0:11:29,686 --> 0:11:34,76
So -- but that's one of those things, you know.


165
0:11:34,76 --> 0:11:37,806
That's called farming, you know.


166
0:11:37,806 --> 0:11:42,736
>> There was no additional fertilizer added
to those cover crops for establishment.


167
0:11:42,736 --> 0:11:47,136
They were just picking up off of
residual N, and also any nitrogen


168
0:11:47,136 --> 0:11:50,516
that they were making while growing the legumes.

0:11:50,516 --> 0:12:6,316
[ Music ]


170
0:12:6,316 --> 0:12:10,766
Establishing these early, and then
terminating them late in the growing season,


171
0:12:10,766 --> 0:12:16,246
usually when other producers have already
planted their crops, allows the rye to get very,


172
0:12:16,246 --> 0:12:18,716
very tall, usually six feet or higher.


173
0:12:18,716 --> 0:12:22,106
So we saw a -- I'm not going to say a problem --


174
0:12:22,106 --> 0:12:26,626
but we saw a challenge as far as
planting into that residue being so big.


175
0:12:26,626 --> 0:12:31,56
But we adapted, overcame, and
have been successful with that.


176
0:12:31,56 --> 0:12:35,106
Last year was the first year that we
actually rolled any cover crops down,


177
0:12:35,106 --> 0:12:39,86
but we saw the benefits of what you could
do if you rolled it completely down.


178
0:12:39,86 --> 0:12:43,986
I let the rye get to soft dough stage, so as
soon as it was snapped, it was terminated.


179
0:12:43,986 --> 0:12:46,876
But since we were not using a
roller crimper, then we would have


180
0:12:46,876 --> 0:12:49,346
to use a herbicide to burn down the legumes.


181
0:12:49,346 --> 0:12:53,66
>> When we were doing the wheat cover crops,
we didn't have to worry about rolling it.


182
0:12:53,66 --> 0:12:54,746
You know, we would just plant right into it.


183
0:12:54,746 --> 0:12:56,276
This rye's a different animal.


184
0:12:56,276 --> 0:13:0,216
You've got so much more biomass there,
you've got to get it to the ground.


185
0:13:0,216 --> 0:13:4,566
And it's a lot easier as far
as being able to see to plant.


186
0:13:4,566 --> 0:13:7,586
I would think it would be
easier as far as the coulters


187
0:13:7,586 --> 0:13:9,646
and row planters to cut in it with it standing.


188
0:13:9,646 --> 0:13:10,266
I'll be honest.


189
0:13:10,266 --> 0:13:18,466
Our cover crop was so tall last year, we could
not have planted it if we hadn't rolled it down.


190
0:13:18,466 --> 0:13:23,186
>> The timing of the burn-down application
differs for Nathan, John, and Curtis.


191
0:13:23,186 --> 0:13:26,476
Their reasons are both practical
and a matter of preference.


192
0:13:26,476 --> 0:13:30,996
For example, Nathan's sprayer
is too small to get over the top


193
0:13:30,996 --> 0:13:34,356
so he has to spray once it's rolled.


194
0:13:34,356 --> 0:13:37,916
>> For our sprayer, we didn't have any
trouble getting over the top of it.


195
0:13:37,916 --> 0:13:39,856
We have a high-clearance sprayer.


196
0:13:39,856 --> 0:13:44,416
>> We were putting more water down in
there, and we were running high pressure,


197
0:13:44,416 --> 0:13:46,596
and we actually slowed up some, too.


198
0:13:46,596 --> 0:13:52,416
We slowed up our water pressure to
get more water to blow it down in it.


199
0:13:52,416 --> 0:13:58,76
And I would terminate these crops probably
about two to three days in front of the roller.


200
0:13:58,76 --> 0:14:3,56
We can get a better kill with the
crops while they're still standing.


201
0:14:3,56 --> 0:14:6,476
>> Curtis just likes to get it done all at once.


202
0:14:6,476 --> 0:14:10,96
>> We took advantage of some of the
equipment that we had on the farm


203
0:14:10,96 --> 0:14:13,336
that we've been using when we tilled the soil.


204
0:14:13,336 --> 0:14:14,986
It's like this cultipacker here.


205
0:14:14,986 --> 0:14:21,16
We're using it to roll rye and cover crop
down, and we're spraying as we go behind it.


206
0:14:21,16 --> 0:14:24,286
And then we have this roller
hard we hadn't used in years.


207
0:14:24,286 --> 0:14:28,736
We drug it out of the weeds, and
put it behind the cultipacker.


208
0:14:28,736 --> 0:14:31,746
And we're actually double-rolling
it and crimping it as we go,


209
0:14:31,746 --> 0:14:34,936
and it's breaking the rye up in pieces.


210
0:14:34,936 --> 0:14:41,636
We're saving one trip with a spray truck or
sprayer and actually doing two jobs at one time,


211
0:14:41,636 --> 0:14:43,516
and it's worked out real great for us.


212
0:14:43,516 --> 0:14:57,156
[ Music ]


213
0:14:57,156 --> 0:15:1,386
>> For farmers who have never done this sort
of thing before, planting into a rolled,


214
0:15:1,386 --> 0:15:5,866
high biomass cover crop is just plain scary.


215
0:15:5,866 --> 0:15:11,606
Our rookies had their share of problems in this
phase, and yet seem to have come out on top.


216
0:15:11,606 --> 0:15:13,846
>> Again, after you roll those cover crops down,


217
0:15:13,846 --> 0:15:17,86
the timing of planting is
going to be crucial also.


218
0:15:17,86 --> 0:15:19,316
>> We did have some wrapping
issues on our row cleaner.


219
0:15:19,316 --> 0:15:28,826
But we had a situation where we did not get it
sprayed like we wanted because of windy days.


220
0:15:28,826 --> 0:15:36,116
We have found that if you can plant
in real green rye, or it be real dead.


221
0:15:36,116 --> 0:15:41,656
That in between, this rye gets
tough when it's trying to dry down.


222
0:15:41,656 --> 0:15:50,616
So that was our main deal last
year, in that tough stage.


223
0:15:50,616 --> 0:15:56,556
>> Late termination often brings with it
the worry of low soil moisture at planting.


224
0:15:56,556 --> 0:16:1,766
Old hands like Ray Styer like to terminate
as late as possible, but local conditions


225
0:16:1,766 --> 0:16:5,596
and sound judgment will always play a role.


226
0:16:5,596 --> 0:16:7,246
>> It's just like this.


227
0:16:7,246 --> 0:16:12,476
I would love to see -- after we terminate and
lay it down, I'd love to see a good rain on it.


228
0:16:12,476 --> 0:16:14,956
That's going to add that
soil moisture right there.


229
0:16:14,956 --> 0:16:20,306
When you lay that mat on top of it, you
won't be disturbing your moisture again.


230
0:16:20,306 --> 0:16:23,536
We love to plant right after a rain, yeah.


231
0:16:23,536 --> 0:16:26,316
>> And as always, there's the talk of equipment.


232
0:16:26,316 --> 0:16:29,446
Again, there was no secret formula.


233
0:16:29,446 --> 0:16:35,416
>> We didn't make any major adjustments to
our planter other than just keeping everything


234
0:16:35,416 --> 0:16:38,786
in tune, keeping coulters updated as needed.


235
0:16:38,786 --> 0:16:44,236
We did add a little bit of weight to our planter
to make sure you could cut through the residue.


236
0:16:44,236 --> 0:16:49,36
It's just a no-till coulter, double disk
opener, and cast iron closing wheels.


237
0:16:49,36 --> 0:16:53,546
>> I think one key thing there is keeping
good sharp coulters on the planter.


238
0:16:53,546 --> 0:16:55,846
You may not get but half the life out of them,


239
0:16:55,846 --> 0:17:2,566
but getting a good stand is worth the difference
there, keeping them sharp and then keeping good,


240
0:17:2,566 --> 0:17:6,96
a close eye on your row cleaners,
keeping them at the right depth.


241
0:17:6,96 --> 0:17:11,806
And the ones I got -- just pull a pin
and you could adjust them real easy.


242
0:17:11,806 --> 0:17:17,206
>> And you might also want to ask whether
they were always able to cut through that mat.


243
0:17:17,206 --> 0:17:19,536
>> We did have some issues last year.


244
0:17:19,536 --> 0:17:23,286
Our problem was on the turn-rows, where
we would come out and try to cross


245
0:17:23,286 --> 0:17:25,396
where the roller had laid it the other way.


246
0:17:25,396 --> 0:17:30,356
Biggest thing, you want to follow
that roller as close as possible,


247
0:17:30,356 --> 0:17:40,496
as far as going with the way
your rye has been laid down.


248
0:17:40,496 --> 0:17:44,326
>> Given that rolled cover crop, I wanted


249
0:17:44,326 --> 0:17:48,236
to know whether there was
any effect on weed control.


250
0:17:48,236 --> 0:17:52,366
>> The rolling down did definitely
give a lot of benefits in weed control.


251
0:17:52,366 --> 0:17:56,796
Having that uniform mat of heavy
residue down only allowed sun


252
0:17:56,796 --> 0:17:58,826
to penetrate where you were planting.


253
0:17:58,826 --> 0:18:1,616
>> The weeds just can't come
up through that thick mat.


254
0:18:1,616 --> 0:18:9,906
We had about 98% weed control,
good weed control this year.


255
0:18:9,906 --> 0:18:11,716
>> I know what you're thinking.


256
0:18:11,716 --> 0:18:19,346
All this talk about cover crops is nice and all,
but how did crops respond in the growing season?


257
0:18:19,346 --> 0:18:24,836
I visited a bit with Curtis and Nathan in
August 2011, to see how things were going.


258
0:18:24,836 --> 0:18:29,626
>> We definitely have seen the moisture
retention, and with the soil health improving,


259
0:18:29,626 --> 0:18:36,836
we're just seeing a lot healthier
crops that we're planting.


260
0:18:36,836 --> 0:18:38,976
>> Got a pretty decent stand, as you can see.


261
0:18:38,976 --> 0:18:42,936
It's -- the spots have filled in great.


262
0:18:42,936 --> 0:18:49,776
And I still have a whole lot of residue left on
the ground, and the ground is still real moist.


263
0:18:49,776 --> 0:18:55,446
I'm just tickled to death with it.


264
0:18:55,446 --> 0:18:57,946
>> This here corn is a little
over eight inches long.


265
0:18:57,946 --> 0:19:7,36
We got 16 rows of kernels on it, and I'm
looking at probably 200 bushel plus corn here.


266
0:19:7,36 --> 0:19:10,566
I've been real pleased with it.


267
0:19:10,566 --> 0:19:16,406
>> When we visited John's fields, his
corn stands looked just as impressive.


268
0:19:16,406 --> 0:19:20,976
>> Moisture, you could go out there
on a dry day and kick the cover back,


269
0:19:20,976 --> 0:19:24,116
and you could still see dark dirt.


270
0:19:24,116 --> 0:19:29,456
I just love the idea of having that organic
base, and having the soil temperatures


271
0:19:29,456 --> 0:19:34,966
down during these hot June and July months.


272
0:19:34,966 --> 0:19:37,186
Roots, is more bigger.


273
0:19:37,186 --> 0:19:39,276
They seem to be looking for the moisture.


274
0:19:39,276 --> 0:19:43,646
And what it is, they go and they find
that moisture underneath that mat.


275
0:19:43,646 --> 0:19:46,456
I'm really protecting myself for June and July.


276
0:19:46,456 --> 0:19:50,726
That's what I look after when
we're talking about cover crops.


277
0:19:50,726 --> 0:19:54,436
>> You could rake that cover crop
back and dig down just a little bit,


278
0:19:54,436 --> 0:20:0,206
and earthworms are just crawling and eating
them microbes, is the way Ray calls it.


279
0:20:0,206 --> 0:20:5,196
>> But what Nathan showed me in some
nearby fields just blew me away.


280
0:20:5,196 --> 0:20:8,866
>> What we're looking at here
is two different producers


281
0:20:8,866 --> 0:20:15,336
that have two different management types for
the cotton rotation that they are currently in.


282
0:20:15,336 --> 0:20:20,76
We did take some soil temperature
readings back when it was 105 one day.


283
0:20:20,76 --> 0:20:25,506
In the field on the left you can see it was
more or less reading 105 at an inch deep.


284
0:20:25,506 --> 0:20:28,456
The field on the right was reading 85,


285
0:20:28,456 --> 0:20:31,996
so we had right around approximately
a 20 degree difference


286
0:20:31,996 --> 0:20:34,616
in soil temperature between those two fields.


287
0:20:34,616 --> 0:20:39,516
And just looking at -- I mean, side by
side comparison, I mean, it tells the tale.


288
0:20:39,516 --> 0:20:42,836

291
0:20:48,196 --> 0:20:51,276
"If you cannot measure it,
you cannot manage it."


292
0:20:51,276 --> 0:20:56,546
Ultimately, it's the yield that provides
us with the verdict for the cover crops.


293
0:20:56,546 --> 0:21:0,486
>> Our first year that we did the cover
crops, we saw a small yield increase.


294
0:21:0,486 --> 0:21:3,896
Typical corn yields were
120 to 150 bushels of corn.


295
0:21:3,896 --> 0:21:9,576
That year we were seeing, where we had the
cover crops, 170, 180 bushel corn in comparison


296
0:21:9,576 --> 0:21:12,726
to where we had the 150 right beside it.


297
0:21:12,726 --> 0:21:18,36
>> Yield this year on dry land corn
was -- we averaged 145 bushels.


298
0:21:18,36 --> 0:21:20,156
I think the county average is 90.


299
0:21:20,156 --> 0:21:25,256
I would be willing to say that we had
a 10-bushel yield increase this year


300
0:21:25,256 --> 0:21:27,336
on corn just because of the cover crops.


301
0:21:27,336 --> 0:21:32,146
>> We had some good corn; 150, 175 bushel corn.


302
0:21:32,146 --> 0:21:38,236
And I'd say where I used cover
crops, they were 10% better.


303
0:21:38,236 --> 0:21:44,916
>> We were right in the range of
1,200 pounds this year on cotton.


304
0:21:44,916 --> 0:21:51,16
>> Everywhere that it was planted on
time, and everything was done right,


305
0:21:51,16 --> 0:21:53,716
it was 1,200- to 1,500-pound cotton.


306
0:21:53,716 --> 0:21:58,516
And where there was no cover crop was
probably 100 pounds less than that.

have to ask yourself, "Can I afford to do this?

Is there a benefit both now and in the future?"


310
0:22:17,56 --> 0:22:19,376
>> Well, it seems like the seed cost is high.


311
0:22:19,376 --> 0:22:24,506
But if you put a pencil to it, and what you're
eventually going to get out of it, it's cheap.


312
0:22:24,506 --> 0:22:30,696
>> Well, if you could take $7.00 corn, cover
crops doubled what they cost us to put them in.


313
0:22:30,696 --> 0:22:32,96
It made us money.


314
0:22:32,96 --> 0:22:40,296
With corn, at $6.50 to $7.00, you know, you've
got cotton in the $0.90 to $1.00 a pound range.


315
0:22:40,296 --> 0:22:50,696
You cannot afford to leave anything on the table
as far as trying to make the biggest returns.

return there is than soil moisture.

And these crops that we put
out this year or last year,


320
0:23:3,566 --> 0:23:5,426
that's going to work down into the soil.

0:23:5,426 --> 0:23:8,66
That's going to be with us for a long time.


322
0:23:8,66 --> 0:23:10,366
I can just see lots of benefits
that could come down the road


323

from this, other than just a one-year deal.

you anywhere from 50 to 150 units of nitrogen.

see in certain situations on a farm,


328
0:23:35,996 --> 0:23:41,186
just depending on landscape, that we could
grow our crops without any synthetic inputs.

going to do my own on-farm test on a few things

like planting with no fertilizing, and putting
half of it, and then putting the full amount,


331
0:23:53,236 --> 0:23:58,996
and maybe some extra, but I'm going to
play with that some, too, this year.

0:24:1,176 --> 0:24:3,956
I think, before we start
backing off on nutrients,

we need to have at least three to four years.


335
0:24:6,566 --> 0:24:9,316
I would say probably down the road we're going

0:24:9,316 --> 0:24:14,126
to cut nutrients back probably
a third, maybe a half.

>> But are these expectations realistic?


338
0:24:17,56 --> 0:24:21,786
Let's visit again with the guys who
have been committed to this for a while.


339
0:24:21,786 --> 0:24:27,326
>> The last seven years we've reduced
our fertilizer cost by as much as 75%,


340
0:24:27,326 --> 0:24:32,466
and I'm really hoping that in the next two
years I can learn to reduce it to zero.


341
0:24:32,466 --> 0:24:39,676
>> I haven't used any nitrogen
on my corn since 1996.


342
0:24:39,676 --> 0:24:44,676
>> We've cut our fertilizer by
90%, and our herbicide use by 75%,


343
0:24:44,676 --> 0:24:47,16
and we have not reached a plateau yet.


344
0:24:47,16 --> 0:24:50,476
I don't believe that anyone
knows where the plateau is.


345
0:24:50,476 --> 0:24:53,866
And we think that we're just going
to keep pushing the system forward,


346
0:24:53,866 --> 0:24:55,516
and see where it takes us from here.

348
0:25:2,46 --> 0:25:6,756
>> Oh my goodness, the no-till, same soil type.


349
0:25:6,756 --> 0:25:8,926
Why did that happen?


350
0:25:8,926 --> 0:25:13,526
Why did the no-till allow
the water to go through?


351
0:25:13,526 --> 0:25:14,616
Did you hear what Max said?


352
0:25:14,616 --> 0:25:19,376
>> About 500 years ago, Niccolò Machiavelli
wrote that "there is nothing more difficult


353
0:25:19,376 --> 0:25:22,846
to carry out than to initiate
a new order of things."


354
0:25:22,846 --> 0:25:28,926
This is partly due to the incredulity of
mankind, who would not believe in anything new


355
0:25:28,926 --> 0:25:31,306
until they have actually experienced it.


356
0:25:31,306 --> 0:25:37,426
But Stanly County has changed
since that North Dakota trip.


357
0:25:37,426 --> 0:25:41,476
>> We're coming home, and
people, my neighbors, think --


358
0:25:41,476 --> 0:25:43,876
they thought, "That poor boy has lost his mind.


359
0:25:43,876 --> 0:25:48,296
He don't know what he -- he's going to lose his
butt and have an auction sale this next fall."


360
0:25:48,296 --> 0:25:53,806
But it's worked out, and they got an open mind
to it now instead of turning their backs to it


361
0:25:53,806 --> 0:25:55,576
and saying, "Oh, he's lost his mind."


362
0:25:55,576 --> 0:26:1,506
And I've had a lot of people call me,
and wanting to know what I'm doing,


363
0:26:1,506 --> 0:26:7,496
how I'm doing it, and if it pays off, and I've
tried to be as honest as I could with everybody


364
0:26:7,496 --> 0:26:12,176
and tell them, "Yeah, it's worked good for me."


365
0:26:12,176 --> 0:26:16,986
>> In Stanly County now, we're starting to
see more and more producers adopt the use


366
0:26:16,986 --> 0:26:22,596
of the cover crop mixes as we have more and more
field days, more and more outreach trainings,


367
0:26:22,596 --> 0:26:27,216
more producers are becoming aware of it,
whether they see it or hear it from me,


368
0:26:27,216 --> 0:26:29,116
hopefully see or hear it from their neighbor.


369
0:26:29,116 --> 0:26:34,106
It makes me feel good to actually
know that we've addressed a resource


370
0:26:34,106 --> 0:28:18,116
and are doing good things to help conserve it.


371
