0:0:5,29 --> 0:0:5,53
XIA HWANG: Hi.


3
0:0:5,53 --> 0:0:5,88
I'm [? Xia ?]


4
0:0:5,88 --> 0:0:6,185
[? Hwang ?].


5
0:0:6,185 --> 0:0:7,4
I'm with Vice.com.


6
0:0:7,4 --> 0:0:8,99
Today we're here to
find out people's


7
0:0:8,99 --> 0:0:10,8
plans for summer loving.


8
0:0:10,8 --> 0:0:13,9
I'm wondering, what's
your plan as far as


9
0:0:13,9 --> 0:0:14,76
summer loving goes?


10
0:0:14,76 --> 0:0:15,41
MALE SPEAKER 1: As
far as what?


11
0:0:15,41 --> 0:0:16,72
MALE SPEAKER 2: Summer living?


12
0:0:16,72 --> 0:0:18,49
XIA HWANG: Summer loving.

0:0:18,49 --> 0:0:19,22
MALE SPEAKER 2: Somewhere
loving?


14
0:0:19,22 --> 0:0:19,623
Or somewhere--


15
0:0:19,623 --> 0:0:20,43
XIA HWANG: Summer.


16
0:0:20,43 --> 0:0:21,24
Summer.


17
0:0:21,24 --> 0:0:22,96
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Summer
is the worst period


18
0:0:22,96 --> 0:0:23,75
to find a good guy.


19
0:0:23,75 --> 0:0:28,9
MALE SPEAKER 3: Girls in NYC are
a little bit more guarded.


20
0:0:28,9 --> 0:0:30,21
You walk down the street and you
try to talk to one, they


21
0:0:30,21 --> 0:0:31,91
think you're a psycho
or something.


22
0:0:31,91 --> 0:0:33,87
MALE SPEAKER 3: In general,
I live and love.


23
0:0:33,87 --> 0:0:34,81
So I love all humans.


24
0:0:34,81 --> 0:0:36,97
So I get to be in love
all the time.


25
0:0:36,97 --> 0:0:40,41
XIA HWANG: Where do you think is
the sexiest place in Paris?


26
0:0:40,41 --> 0:0:41,66
MALE SPEAKER 5: My home.


27
0:0:41,66 --> 0:0:43,42



28
0:0:43,42 --> 0:0:46,38
XIA HWANG: Do you mind to
tell us your location?


29
0:0:46,38 --> 0:0:46,95
MALE SPEAKER 5: No.


30
0:0:46,95 --> 0:0:48,62
XIA HWANG: Men who wear
shorts, do you


31
0:0:48,62 --> 0:0:51,3
think they're sexy?


32
0:0:51,3 --> 0:0:51,85
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: No.


33
0:0:51,85 --> 0:0:53,9
XIA HWANG: What about
flip-flops?


34
0:0:53,9 --> 0:0:53,75
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Flip-flops?


35
0:0:53,75 --> 0:0:56,8
XIA HWANG: Do you think French
people are into Asian girls?


36
0:0:56,8 --> 0:0:57,67
MALE SPEAKER 5: No.


37
0:0:57,67 --> 0:0:59,4
MALE SPEAKER 3: I definitely
like certain things.


38
0:0:59,4 --> 0:1:0,7
I like light skin.


39
0:1:0,7 --> 0:1:1,18
I like half-black, half-white.


40
0:1:1,18 --> 0:1:2,4
I like Latin girls.


41
0:1:2,4 --> 0:1:6,18
But then again, Scarlett
Johansson is awesome.


42
0:1:6,18 --> 0:1:9,33
When I get some more external
power, I'm totally going to


43
0:1:9,33 --> 0:1:10,61
take you on a date.


44
0:1:10,61 --> 0:1:12,18
XIA HWANG: Do you think you'll
bring God to the


45
0:1:12,18 --> 0:1:13,99
bedroom with you?


46
0:1:13,99 --> 0:1:17,17
MALE SPEAKER 5: I don't
leave God anywhere.


47
0:1:17,17 --> 0:1:18,1
I make love.


48
0:1:18,1 --> 0:1:20,18
I don't fuck anymore.


49
0:1:20,18 --> 0:1:22,73
XIA HWANG: If you can take a
girl that you love on a date


50
0:1:22,73 --> 0:1:26,54
in the summer, where would
you like to bring her to?


51
0:1:26,54 --> 0:1:27,79
MALE SPEAKER 2: In the summer,
somewhere nice.


52
0:1:27,79 --> 0:1:29,74
First, I'd like to
know her first.


53
0:1:29,74 --> 0:1:32,59
Because you can't just take
any girl anywhere, right?


54
0:1:32,59 --> 0:1:33,49
MALE SPEAKER 3: The woods.


55
0:1:33,49 --> 0:1:34,92
A lot more fun.


56
0:1:34,92 --> 0:1:37,34
Tie each other to trees.


57
0:1:37,34 --> 0:1:38,16
It's all fun and games.


58
0:1:38,16 --> 0:1:39,67
Just don't do it during
hunting season.


59
0:1:39,67 --> 0:1:42,74
XIA HWANG: Are you afraid that
when that's happening you hear


60
0:1:42,74 --> 0:1:44,71
people shooting guns?


61
0:1:44,71 --> 0:1:46,43
MALE SPEAKER 3: The gunshots
don't bother me.


62
0:1:46,43 --> 0:1:47,19
I'm a gun owner.


63
0:1:47,19 --> 0:1:49,88
XIA HWANG: How can a girl
catches your eye?


64
0:1:49,88 --> 0:1:51,41
MALE SPEAKER 2: Catch my eye?


65
0:1:51,41 --> 0:1:53,22
One girl?


66
0:1:53,22 --> 0:1:54,47
Be alone.


67
0:1:54,47 --> 0:3:54,47
