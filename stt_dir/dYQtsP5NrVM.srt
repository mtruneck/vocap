1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:22,636



2
0:0:22,636 --> 0:0:24,124
MALE SPEAKER: Get
in the hold now.


3
0:0:24,124 --> 0:0:26,108
Get in the hold now.


4
0:0:26,108 --> 0:0:27,69
Get in the hold now.


5
0:0:27,69 --> 0:0:27,95
Whoa!


6
0:0:27,95 --> 0:0:28,821
Come on.


7
0:0:28,821 --> 0:0:30,264
Come on.


8
0:0:30,264 --> 0:0:31,23
Turn around.


9
0:0:31,23 --> 0:0:33,296
EARL TSOSIE, JR: When we get to
rodeos now, we meet people.


10
0:0:33,296 --> 0:0:37,93
And that's when we have our
time, we meet a lot of people.


11
0:0:37,93 --> 0:0:43,4
We have our own ways of making
a living, like this.


12
0:0:43,4 --> 0:0:46,79
The triple B, that's a good
association triple B, they're


13
0:0:46,79 --> 0:0:47,68
giving back to us.


14
0:0:47,68 --> 0:0:50,1
A lot of these associations,
they'll take you to


15
0:0:50,1 --> 0:0:50,85
the finals and stuff.


16
0:0:50,85 --> 0:0:55,59
But the amount of money is
sometimes not there.


17
0:0:55,59 --> 0:0:58,39
This is you and the animal,
you and the horse that's


18
0:0:58,39 --> 0:1:0,23
inside that chute.


19
0:1:0,23 --> 0:1:2,88
Out during the ride when you're
going at it to the


20
0:1:2,88 --> 0:1:4,58
eight seconds, you know.


21
0:1:4,58 --> 0:1:7,79
You don't hear much, you just
see the horse going at it and


22
0:1:7,79 --> 0:1:9,426
you doing your part.


23
0:1:9,426 --> 0:1:11,805
That's just how it goes.


24
0:1:11,805 --> 0:1:36,32



25
0:1:36,32 --> 0:1:38,195
And you just get off
the pick-up man.


26
0:1:38,195 --> 0:1:43,21
And that's when you just tip
your hat to the crowd like


27
0:1:43,21 --> 0:1:46,33
thank you, guys.


28
0:1:46,33 --> 0:1:49,49
I just got up, I ran.


29
0:1:49,49 --> 0:1:51,37
Walking back, I'm talking
to myself like you're


30
0:1:51,37 --> 0:1:52,34
going to win today.


31
0:1:52,34 --> 0:1:53,62
Like, this is your day.


32
0:1:53,62 --> 0:1:56,112
I feel it already, that's
why I woke up.


33
0:1:56,112 --> 0:1:58,4
I was like OK, I'm going to get
here, I'm going to get me


34
0:1:58,4 --> 0:2:0,36
a good horse and I'm
going to win.


35
0:2:0,36 --> 0:2:3,75
And it turned out my way.


36
0:2:3,75 --> 0:2:5,46
I'm pretty happy.


37
0:2:5,46 --> 0:2:7,75
I've got some money
in my pocket and


38
0:2:7,75 --> 0:2:8,53
another belt buckle.


39
0:2:8,53 --> 0:2:10,7
And it bumped me up
in the standings.


40
0:2:10,7 --> 0:2:11,46
And this rodeo's pretty good.


41
0:2:11,46 --> 0:2:13,1
I've been here last
year and I won it.


42
0:2:13,1 --> 0:2:15,24
That's all there is
to do out there.


43
0:2:15,24 --> 0:2:19,35
There's no mall, no movie
theater out there, so you got


44
0:2:19,35 --> 0:2:20,21
to find something to do.


45
0:2:20,21 --> 0:2:21,99
But it keeps you busy.


46
0:2:21,99 --> 0:2:26,95
The weekend flies by fast and
pretty soon the rodeo again.


47
0:2:26,95 --> 0:2:31,47



48
0:2:31,47 --> 0:2:34,41
BERT JONES: I started at a young
age with just having


49
0:2:34,41 --> 0:2:34,97
practice bulls.


50
0:2:34,97 --> 0:2:41,484
And then getting interested
in buying bucking bulls.


51
0:2:41,484 --> 0:2:44,15
All right, now we're just going
to load up the bulls.


52
0:2:44,15 --> 0:2:50,48



53
0:2:50,48 --> 0:2:53,74
So I've been in the bucking
bull business


54
0:2:53,74 --> 0:2:56,4
for about 10 years.


55
0:2:56,4 --> 0:2:59,892
And the bull run part maybe
ever since I was


56
0:2:59,892 --> 0:3:2,37
12, so about 16 years.


57
0:3:2,37 --> 0:3:6,95
Yeah, we're going to hook up
the trailer and then we'll


58
0:3:6,95 --> 0:3:9,59
chase the bulls into
a pen right here.


59
0:3:9,59 --> 0:3:13,0
And then we'll back up the
trailer right there and then


60
0:3:13,0 --> 0:3:14,25
load up the bulls.


61
0:3:14,25 --> 0:3:30,196



62
0:3:30,196 --> 0:3:31,85
CORY ROSE CHEE: If I
have homework or


63
0:3:31,85 --> 0:3:33,46
anything, I won't ride.


64
0:3:33,46 --> 0:3:34,74
I get my homework done first.


65
0:3:34,74 --> 0:3:37,15
My mom always tells me
school comes first.


66
0:3:37,15 --> 0:3:39,1
You can always rodeo, there's
always another rodeo.


67
0:3:39,1 --> 0:3:41,625
And if I want to go to a rodeo
and I have a class, she says


68
0:3:41,625 --> 0:3:44,215
Cory Rose, go to class.


69
0:3:44,215 --> 0:3:45,4
It's usually on the weekends.


70
0:3:45,4 --> 0:3:47,63
Usually Fridays, Saturdays,
and Sundays are when the


71
0:3:47,63 --> 0:3:49,53
rodeos take place.


72
0:3:49,53 --> 0:3:51,44
I compete with whatever.


73
0:3:51,44 --> 0:3:53,36
I enjoy competing
with men though.


74
0:3:53,36 --> 0:3:55,19
It's a rush, an adrenaline
rush.


75
0:3:55,19 --> 0:3:57,27
Not many women can do it.


76
0:3:57,27 --> 0:3:58,685
That's my strongest event,
team roping.


77
0:3:58,685 --> 0:4:0,63
And barrel racing, I'm not
really interested.


78
0:4:0,63 --> 0:4:1,92
But my mom pushes me
for the all-around.


79
0:4:1,92 --> 0:4:7,622



80
0:4:7,622 --> 0:4:10,44
Good boy.


81
0:4:10,44 --> 0:4:13,31
Usually when I'm up here, I just
let him come up and sit


82
0:4:13,31 --> 0:4:14,58
and just look at the barrels.


83
0:4:14,58 --> 0:4:16,73
And then you'll notice
that his ears--


84
0:4:16,73 --> 0:4:17,779
he'll tell you when
he's ready.


85
0:4:17,779 --> 0:4:19,22
When you're ready, he'll
know when you're ready.


86
0:4:19,22 --> 0:4:21,64
You can just see by his ears,
one of his ears will be down


87
0:4:21,64 --> 0:4:23,6
and one will be looking towards
that first barrel.


88
0:4:23,6 --> 0:4:25,51
Or both of them will be up ,
looking at that barrel, and


89
0:4:25,51 --> 0:4:26,7
that's when he's ready to go.


90
0:4:26,7 --> 0:4:28,73
It's hard to rodeo and
pay for entry fees.


91
0:4:28,73 --> 0:4:30,2
It's hard to find
sponsors because


92
0:4:30,2 --> 0:4:33,7
they're in the same situation.


93
0:4:33,7 --> 0:4:35,19
Usually when you win you
roll your money.


94
0:4:35,19 --> 0:4:35,96
You roll it.


95
0:4:35,96 --> 0:4:37,68
If you win, that's real good.


96
0:4:37,68 --> 0:4:40,9
And if you lose, you're
shit out of luck.


97
0:4:40,9 --> 0:4:43,2
Yeah, we suffer for a while, and
then you have to find your


98
0:4:43,2 --> 0:4:45,78
own way home or anything,
food-wise and your horse.


99
0:4:45,78 --> 0:4:47,86
And if you win, you'll
just keep going.


100
0:4:47,86 --> 0:4:50,72
LENA MITIS CHEE: Going down.


101
0:4:50,72 --> 0:4:54,62
Go ahead and cut the
white one, too.


102
0:4:54,62 --> 0:4:57,31
Come down the back
side, right here.


103
0:4:57,31 --> 0:5:0,21
Easy, pull it up, back
further, and then


104
0:5:0,21 --> 0:5:2,662
just slide on down.


105
0:5:2,662 --> 0:5:5,225
She doctors with me a little
bit, but she's still learning.


106
0:5:5,225 --> 0:5:9,41
So I'm constantly riding her
all the time about my way's


107
0:5:9,41 --> 0:5:12,52
the right way.


108
0:5:12,52 --> 0:5:14,14
CORY ROSE CHEE: My
mom, she beads.


109
0:5:14,14 --> 0:5:16,75
She'll sell her beadwork
and everything.


110
0:5:16,75 --> 0:5:18,91
Or it'll end up, my family will
try to help out with my


111
0:5:18,91 --> 0:5:20,16
sponsoring and everything.


112
0:5:20,16 --> 0:5:23,3



113
0:5:23,3 --> 0:5:25,8
LENA MITIS CHEE: With
her dad, he ropes a


114
0:5:25,8 --> 0:5:26,21
lot, and he gets her.


115
0:5:26,21 --> 0:5:29,18
He'll throw a rope
at that thing 100


116
0:5:29,18 --> 0:5:31,29
times without missing.


117
0:5:31,29 --> 0:5:33,63
We don't keep a lot
of trophies.


118
0:5:33,63 --> 0:5:35,28
I mean, we get buckles.


119
0:5:35,28 --> 0:5:38,74
You're looking for buckles and
you're looking for saddles,


120
0:5:38,74 --> 0:5:39,98
breastcollars.


121
0:5:39,98 --> 0:5:42,13
Anything that says, hey,
I was there and I won.


122
0:5:42,13 --> 0:5:43,47
This is what I got.


123
0:5:43,47 --> 0:5:44,77
And that's what you're
looking for when


124
0:5:44,77 --> 0:5:45,69
you're going to rodeo.


125
0:5:45,69 --> 0:5:48,66
Something to show that hey, I'm
this good and I can do it.


126
0:5:48,66 --> 0:5:51,32
Bragging rights is what it is.


127
0:5:51,32 --> 0:5:54,952



128
0:5:54,952 --> 0:6:0,5
EARL TSOSIE, JR: When I was
raised up, we were kind of low


129
0:6:0,5 --> 0:6:3,8
on money and trying to help
out my mom and everything.


130
0:6:3,8 --> 0:6:5,83
Now we're up there and a lot of
people look up to us now.


131
0:6:5,83 --> 0:6:9,29
Back then, they probably were
thinking they won't succeed,


132
0:6:9,29 --> 0:6:9,96
you know what I mean?


133
0:6:9,96 --> 0:6:12,3
It's a good thing I
joined the rodeo.


134
0:6:12,3 --> 0:6:14,75
Because if I didn't join the
rodeo, I don't know what I'd


135
0:6:14,75 --> 0:6:14,625
be doing now.


136
0:6:14,625 --> 0:6:19,21
I'd have probably been doing
something crazy with my life.


137
0:6:19,21 --> 0:6:21,83
But no, this really
changed me.


138
0:6:21,83 --> 0:6:24,88
So now I just go rodeo
full time.


139
0:6:24,88 --> 0:6:28,94
It really gave me a positive
attitude and stay up there.


140
0:6:28,94 --> 0:6:30,62
But every rodeo I hit,
every weekend.


141
0:6:30,62 --> 0:6:35,61
And I win, I place second,
third, and then I get money


142
0:6:35,61 --> 0:6:36,23
from there.


143
0:6:36,23 --> 0:6:38,63
A good rodeo, good weekend,
you'll at least walk away for


144
0:6:38,63 --> 0:6:39,86
like maybe two grand.


145
0:6:39,86 --> 0:6:43,29
So it's pretty good every
weekend, it's how we pay our


146
0:6:43,29 --> 0:6:44,38
stuff, you know?


147
0:6:44,38 --> 0:6:46,63
I bring these back just
to make my mom and


148
0:6:46,63 --> 0:6:47,9
dad proud of me.


149
0:6:47,9 --> 0:6:50,4
Show somebody I can
do something.


150
0:6:50,4 --> 0:6:52,17
When we entered, a bunch of
riders were probably thinking


151
0:6:52,17 --> 0:6:55,57
like they won't go long.


152
0:6:55,57 --> 0:7:0,59
And now all them riders are
ducking and diving for muscle.


153
0:7:0,59 --> 0:7:3,34
But we don't worry about the
other riders, we just throw


154
0:7:3,34 --> 0:7:11,735
our stuff on the horse 110%.


155
0:7:11,735 --> 0:7:14,64
CORY ROSE CHEE: When you can't
focus, you can't win.


156
0:7:14,64 --> 0:7:15,82
When you're at a rodeo
and you're stressed


157
0:7:15,82 --> 0:7:16,34
with all the crap--


158
0:7:16,34 --> 0:7:17,28
I need to win this one.


159
0:7:17,28 --> 0:7:19,66
If I don't win this one
I'm out, I can't


160
0:7:19,66 --> 0:7:20,91
get in for next weekend.


161
0:7:20,91 --> 0:7:26,56



162
0:7:26,56 --> 0:7:29,14
When I'm out roping sometimes,
and I'm tired because I just


163
0:7:29,14 --> 0:7:32,1
barely pulled in and it's my
turn to rope, I kind of lose


164
0:7:32,1 --> 0:7:34,5
concentration and slack off
because I'm so tired.


165
0:7:34,5 --> 0:7:36,83
And I'm stressing like if I
don't win, and the what-ifs


166
0:7:36,83 --> 0:7:38,41
and all the maybes and stuff.


167
0:7:38,41 --> 0:7:42,5
But the key to it is practice,
practice, practice.


168
0:7:42,5 --> 0:7:47,8



169
0:7:47,8 --> 0:7:49,44
But rodeo can wait.


170
0:7:49,44 --> 0:7:51,11
School, my boys is taking
care of them.


171
0:7:51,11 --> 0:7:54,79
Making sure they're healthy, in
shape, well taken care of.


172
0:7:54,79 --> 0:7:57,52
The economy goes bad, I'm not
going to sell my horses.


173
0:7:57,52 --> 0:7:59,67
There's no way in heck I'm
going to sell my horses.


174
0:7:59,67 --> 0:8:0,5
Take anything else.


175
0:8:0,5 --> 0:8:1,98
Take my car, I could
care less.


176
0:8:1,98 --> 0:8:2,9
Just as long as I
have my horses.


177
0:8:2,9 --> 0:8:4,1
These are my best friends.


178
0:8:4,1 --> 0:8:6,44
When I have something wrong,
I'll go outside and talk to


179
0:8:6,44 --> 0:8:8,36
them, they'll just
stand there.


180
0:8:8,36 --> 0:8:9,77
They like to be loved.


181
0:8:9,77 --> 0:8:12,1
But like I said, when it's time
to do work, they know


182
0:8:12,1 --> 0:8:13,54
when it is.


183
0:8:13,54 --> 0:8:15,89
Once you get them out, every
single day we're riding each


184
0:8:15,89 --> 0:8:17,2
horse about an hour a day.


185
0:8:17,2 --> 0:8:19,19
Bringing them up here,
and running barrels.


186
0:8:19,19 --> 0:8:20,91
Roping the dummies,
then saddling up.


187
0:8:20,91 --> 0:8:23,0
Roping your dummy off
them, then that's


188
0:8:23,0 --> 0:8:24,25
when they're golden.


189
0:8:24,25 --> 0:8:33,96



190
0:8:33,96 --> 0:8:35,585
EARL TSOSIE, JR: And this
is where I was raised.


191
0:8:35,585 --> 0:8:38,87
Where I spend most of my time,
here at the horse corral.


192
0:8:38,87 --> 0:8:44,23
Out there riding on the
mountains, and herding sheep.


193
0:8:44,23 --> 0:8:48,1
I started in sheep when
five years old.


194
0:8:48,1 --> 0:8:51,59
From there I just learned
how to ride the horse.


195
0:8:51,59 --> 0:8:53,88
This place is all
family owned.


196
0:8:53,88 --> 0:8:56,43
My grandpa's brothers
live over there,


197
0:8:56,43 --> 0:8:58,1
so this is all family.


198
0:8:58,1 --> 0:9:1,925
So you can do whatever
you want to do.


199
0:9:1,925 --> 0:9:5,45
When I was raised up, my grandpa
and grandma used to


200
0:9:5,45 --> 0:9:6,69
just wake me up in
the morning.


201
0:9:6,69 --> 0:9:8,735
They used to tell
me to go run.


202
0:9:8,735 --> 0:9:11,45
If you really want something
you have to go run and beat


203
0:9:11,45 --> 0:9:13,71
the sun up.


204
0:9:13,71 --> 0:9:16,972
So it's kind of like a
traditional thing, I guess.


205
0:9:16,972 --> 0:9:21,73
Like, if you run in the morning,
that's where all the


206
0:9:21,73 --> 0:9:23,79
good stuff come from.


207
0:9:23,79 --> 0:9:27,34
If you beat the sun, you know
you can beat anything.


208
0:9:27,34 --> 0:9:28,68
I just need to get
a new motor.


209
0:9:28,68 --> 0:9:32,29
Fix it up a little, this
will be my rodeo car.


210
0:9:32,29 --> 0:9:33,68
Get me to some rodeos
a lot faster.


211
0:9:33,68 --> 0:9:36,53



212
0:9:36,53 --> 0:9:40,54
I'm kind of like a rock
and roll type of guy.


213
0:9:40,54 --> 0:9:43,486
I listen to country
here and there.


214
0:9:43,486 --> 0:9:45,736
But kind of more into a
little rock and roll--


215
0:9:45,736 --> 0:9:48,13
it gets me going.


216
0:9:48,13 --> 0:9:49,77
Maybe next year you'll
see me cruising


217
0:9:49,77 --> 0:9:51,2
this car to the rodeo.


218
0:9:51,2 --> 0:11:51,2
