###13 The entire money-structured and materialistic-oriented society
###17 is a false society.
###19 Our society will go down in history as the lowest development in man.
###23 We have the brains, the know-how, the technology
###26 and the feasibility to build an entirely new civilization.
###46 (Jacque Fresco) It was living through the 1929 Great Depression
###52 that helped shape my social conscience.
###56 During this time, I realized the Earth was still the same place:
###61 manufacturing plants were still intact and resources were still there
###66 but people didn't have the money to buy the products.
###71 I felt that the rules of the game we play by
###75 were obsolete and insufficient.
###79 Misery, suffering and war provided the incentive for my life's work.
###85 I was also motivated by the seeming incompetence of governments
###91 the academic world, and the lack of solutions offered by scientists.
###97 I realized that instead of working with individuals
###100 a more effective method would be to redesign the culture.
###107 This began a lifelong quest to finding solutions
###111 to the many problems that we have today.
###121 (Narrator) This presentation is a feasible plan for social change
###126 that works toward a peaceful and sustainable global civilization
###130 where human beings, technology and nature coexist.
###137 It outlines an alternative to strive for
###141 where human rights are not only paper proclamations
###145 but a way of life.
###151 It is called The Venus Project.
###159 Its founder, Jacque Fresco
###162 calls for a straightforward redesign of the culture in which war
###166 poverty, hunger, debt and unnecessary human suffering
###171 are viewed not only as avoidable but totally unacceptable.
###178 It is becoming increasingly obvious that anything less
###181 will simply result in a continuation of the same problems we face today.
###201 The Venus Project's research center
###205 constructed by Fresco and Roxanne Meadows
###208 is located in Venus, Florida.
###212 It addresses many of the root causes of our difficulties.
###216 But what are the real origins of our problems?
###231 At present, we are left with very few alternatives
###235 since we are on a collision course of our own making.
###241 Answers from yesterday are no longer relevant.
###247 Considering the damage already done to the environment
###250 we are rapidly approaching a point of no return
###254 where nature will dictate the course.
###258 Either we continue as we have
###260 with outmoded social customs and habits of thought
###264 thereby threatening our future
###267 or, we apply a more appropriate set of values
###271 relevant to a sustainable society
###274 with more opportunity and freedoms.
###280 Americans have been conditioned in their kind of society
###283 to get a different kind of car next year
###286 to buy a new television set, or a tape recorder.
###288 We are radical as hell but our political and social institutions
###293 have not changed and this is where we are stagnating:
###296 because we always equate any new idea with communism or regimentation
###301 because we have been brought up to fear that which is new.
###305 (Narrator) None of the world's economic systems:
###308 socialism, communism, fascism or the free enterprise system
###313 have eliminated the problems of elitism, nationalism, racism
###319 and most of all, scarcity.
###324 These are all based primarily on economic disparity.
###329 When money is used to regulate and distribute resources for profit
###333 and people and nations are out for themselves
###336 they will seek advantage at any cost.
###339 They do this by maintaining a competitive edge
###342 or through military intervention.
###346 War represents the supreme failure of nations to resolve their differences.
###352 From a strictly pragmatic standpoint
###355 it is the most inefficient waste of lives and resources ever conceived.
###361 Most wars are for the control of resources
###365 and maintaining your position of differential advantage.
###368 They're not based on the 'dignity of man.'
###371 They're not based on elevating human beings.
###374 It might elevate the human beings in the country that's the victor.
###378 It might do that. But as far as the rest of the world goes
###382 the price is enormous.
###385 (Narrator) This crude and violent attempt to resolve international differences
###389 takes on even more ominous overtones
###392 with the advent of computerized nuclear delivery systems
###396 and deadly biological and chemical weapons.
###405 Yet it is a windfall, money-making opportunity
###408 for those who profit by the military-industrial complex.
###414 If the profit were taken out of wars
###416 do you really believe we would have them?
###420 (Jacque Fresco) If they draft you into the army to serve this country
###423 (you put up your life for this country)
###426 they should draft all the war industries:
###429 every cannon maker, machine gun maker
###432 automobiles, jeeps, warships
###435 all drafted, so they're on the same basis of pay as the army.
###441 Then it's real. But if you make millions selling warships
###444 and machine guns to the army, then it's corrupt.
###448 I would (if I had my way), if we had millions of men in the army
###453 I'd send them to school to become problem solvers
###456 how to get along with other nations. That's what we have to do, not kill.
###461 Soldiers are just killing machines; they're trained to kill.
###469 I would train them to be able to go to Mexico and bridge the difference
###473 and go to the Arab world and see if they can bridge the difference.
###477 So bring them all together, all the nations.
###482 (Narrator) War is not the only form of violence imposed upon people.
###487 There is also hunger, poverty
###491 homelessness and unemployment.
###495 The acceptance of these conditions as expressive of 'human nature' is a myth
###500 used to keep things as they are.
###509 Genetics has nothing to do with greed, business, race prejudice.
###515 All of the operant systems in any society are part of your education
###520 the books you read, the role models you follow and the people you admire.
###524 The genes have nothing to do...
###528 except with the color of your eyes, the shape of your nose
###531 perhaps inherited features.
###536 The genes do not control values.
###544 Even if you're born with a much better brain than another person
###548 meaning better receptors, the quality of the tissue is better
###552 I would say that if you have a better brain
###555 and you live in a fascist country you become a fascist faster.
###560 The brain has no mechanism of discrimination.
###564 The brain can't tell you what is relevant or less relevant
###569 except experience.
###574 (Narrator) We are not born with greed, envy, hatred, or bigotry.
###581 Our behavior and values are reflective of the culture we are exposed to.
###588 If you were raised by the headhunters of the Amazon
###592 you'd be a headhunter.
###594 If I said to you "Doesn't it bother you to have 5 shrunken heads?"
###598 you'd say "Yes, my brother has 20."
###602 Is he nuts? No, that's normal to his culture.
###610 Social and environmental problems will remain insurmountable
###614 as long as few nations control most of the Earth's resources
###618 and the bottom line is profit over the well-being of people.
###623 Putting profit first results in unnecessary suffering
###626 and aberrant behavior prevalent today.
###633 Many people feel that we need the rule of law to eliminate our problems.
###638 We have many laws, thousands upon thousands of them
###642 but they are constantly being broken.
###645 Paper proclamations and treaties do not alter the facts of scarcity
###651 deprivation, and insecurity.
###656 You can predict the shape of the future and the values if you know
###662 the trends of events in the ocean pollution, the scarcity of arable land...
###667 If you watch that degrading system grow
###671 I can predict the riots and killing and assassination.
###675 Human behavior is really generated by the surrounding environment.
###680 If there's a scarcity, say of water, it is prized and its price is high.
###686 Let's discuss scarcity as a system.
###689 Suppose it rained gold for about 3 days, gold dust.
###694 People would go out and shovel it in, fill their cellars
###696 the attic, every drawer in the house. They'd throw out their clothing.
###700 If the rain kept up for a year so that gold was all over the place
###704 people would sweep it out of the house, take their rings off, throw them away
###708 and so human behavior undergoes change to that condition.
###712 There's only a policeman in front of something that people have need for
###718 and don't have access to, so you put a guard there.
###722 But if lemon trees or orange trees and apple trees
###725 grew all over the place, you couldn't sell it.
###728 If you landed on an island that was so abundant with resources
###732 you had 10 people, there were 1000 fish for every person if you wanted it,
###736 there were 10 times the amount of breadfruit and bananas
###739 money would not come into existence.
###741 Private property would not come into existence.
###744 If the island was big enough: there were 10 people, there were 8000 acres
###749 no one would give a damn about staking out this particular area.
###755 There are patterns of behavior that promote survival.
###758 There are social conditions that change our values and outlook.
###762 No one can write a constitution of required behavior
###767 without consulting the environment.
###771 So, we'd better take care of the environment
###774 we'd better take care of one another and we'd better educate people
###778 to the highest possible levels of our ability
###781 in order to have a society.
###786 (Narrator) Even a peace treaty cannot prevent another war
###789 if the underlying causes are not dealt with.
###793 Maybe what are needed are ethical people in government
###796 who will work toward everyone's well-being.
###801 But even if the most ethical people were elected to high positions
###804 and we ran out of resources, there would still be lying
###808 cheating, stealing and corruption.
###812 It's not ethical people that are needed but rather
###815 a way of intelligently managing the Earth's resources for everyone's well-being.
###831 Let's examine our social arrangements further.
###836 To maintain our economy, products must continuously be sold.
###843 To assure this, they are deliberately designed to wear out and break down.
###849 Maybe you've noticed this usually happens
###852 right after the warranty expires.
###857 This corrupt practice is referred to as 'planned obsolescence'
###862 which is the conscious withdrawal of efficiency.
###868 Innovators go through the finest schools and then are required
###872 to design things that wear out and break down right on schedule.
###878 This results in a tremendous waste of resources and energy.
###885 We are plundering the planet for profits.
###892 If you think about it, it isn't a job people want
###895 but access to what their paycheck will bring.
###899 Money does not represent anything real
###902 and there's no gold, silver or resource to back it up.
###909 You can't eat money or build a house of it.
###912 It is not even related to our real capacity
###915 to produce goods and services on this planet.
###918 The monetary system has been handed down from centuries ago
###922 and we continue to use it without questions.
###934 This system will keep installing more and more automation
###937 cutting down on the purchasing power of the majority of people.
###940 There will come a time (it's called the Gaussian curve)
###944 where employment is that, production is this
###947 and purchasing power is that. The system stops.
###951 Banks fail and nothing works anymore.
###953 We're moving in that direction very rapidly.
###956 - We have finally gotten to a place in 2011
###962 where it's becoming obvious that the machine has beaten the man.
###965 - We are incredibly productive with far fewer people.
###970 - We are more productive as an economy than ever before.
###972 - An iPad app can do more than four people.
###976 - It's just that there are fewer jobs. The jobs that do exist now
###979 can have lower wages because of obvious reasons:
###981 a lot of people are looking for a small number of jobs.
###984 The wages go down, that has huge impacts on the middle class
###987 and ripples out from there.
###989 We're moving towards social collapse.
###991 I think this is going to happen all over the world, not just here.
###995 It doesn't require the overthrow of the government.
###997 It just requires that you let it alone; it will overthrow itself.
###1002 If you control the media, you can calm people down.
###1005 But if the majority keeps getting laid off, they don't have purchasing power
###1010 the system collapses. It doesn't work anymore; they invade.
###1013 It's already happening, this country is already insoluble.
###1018 They're going to have difficulty with national security, paying pension people:
###1023 they've spent far beyond what they already have.
###1027 All they can do now is create debt, borrow more and more money from banks.
###1032 - We also want to show you a rather grim sign of our times
###1035 it's not far from here in Midtown Manhattan.
###1037 The national debt has grown too large for the National Debt Clock.
###1042 It went up back in 1989
###1044 when the nation's debt was less than 3 trillion dollars.
###1048 The debt has been piling up so fast lately they had to drop the dollar sign
###1053 to make room for an extra digit as the number turned over
###1056 to more than ten trillion dollars now and counting every second.
###1062 A whole new clock with two extra spaces will go up next year.
###1067 The federal government is not allowed to print money.
###1070 It's not allowed to lend money or get in the banking business.
###1074 That is a privilege for bankers only.
###1077 So what the government has to do if they want to build an air force
###1080 say of 2000 planes a month
###1082 they have to borrow money from a private lending institution
###1086 sign the dotted line, and if the war is lost or failed
###1090 the burden falls on the public to pay off that debt.
###1117 (Narrator) We find ourselves and our social constructs
###1120 in a transitional state, a matter of social evolution.
###1125 If we want to make it through these turbulent times
###1127 we must be able to adapt to change.
###1131 All things change, including our social systems.
###1137 Albert Einstein stated:
###1149 Earth is still abundant with resources.
###1152 Our practice of rationing resources through monetary control
###1156 is no longer relevant and is actually counterproductive to our very survival.
###1163 Today we have highly advanced technologies
###1167 but our social and economic system has not kept up with our technological capabilities
###1172 which could otherwise easily create a world of abundance for all
###1176 free of servitude and debt.
###1179 How can this be possible?
###1182 There is not enough money to feed or house all people on this planet
###1186 let alone accomplish these more ambitious ends.
###1190 But Earth has more than enough resources to meet the needs of all people
###1196 but only if managed intelligently.
###1209 (Narrator) Jacque Fresco envisions a solution that he calls
###1212 a Resource-Based Economy.
###1214 It is a socio-economic system in which all goods and services
###1217 are available to everyone without the use of money
###1221 barter, credit, debt or servitude of any kind.
###1227 It is unlike any social system that has gone before.
###1231 Fresco arrived at this direction through 75 years of study
###1234 and experimental research.
###1242 A Resource-Based Economy operates on the basis of available resources
###1248 and makes those resources available to every human being on earth
###1252 free of charge, without a price tag.
###1255 We have today more than enough resources
###1259 to build a far more advanced society.
###1262 I'm not talking about limited handouts so that people just get by.
###1266 I'm talking about a very advanced civilization.
###1269 We have the resources, we have the technology, all we have to do is apply it.
###1274 (Roxanne Meadows) One of the main aspects of The Venus Project
###1277 is to eliminate scarcity; this is where the technology comes into play.
###1282 Because if we set up a Resource-Based Economy
###1285 and some things are scarce, it won't work.
###1288 If you set up a Resource-Based Economy
###1290 in a society that has no resources, it won't work.
###1294 Today with our technology we can make things available.
###1298 We can eliminate scarcity, we can create an abundance.
###1302 As long as we can create that abundance, that will eliminate greed
###1306 and selfishness, and a lot of crime and a lot of aberrant behavior.
###1313 (Narrator) A social system can be designed
###1315 so that all can live fully and constructively
###1318 if the powers of science and technology are directed toward human and environmental concern
###1323 and overcoming the artificial scarcities of our debt-based monetary systems.
###1330 All people, regardless of political philosophy, social customs
###1335 or religious differences ultimately depend upon the same resources:
###1340 clean air and water
###1342 arable land
###1344 medical care and a relevant education.
###1350 I think if you pledge allegiance to the Earth and everyone on it
###1356 that'd be the way to go for the future.
###1359 (Narrator) The human species is a single family and the world is home to everyone.
###1364 Neither nations nor people can co-exist separately any longer.
###1369 No more separate nations, so that anyone can go anywhere.
###1373 Before the states joined together, they used to stake out their territory.
###1378 They used to fight, they had militias. They would fight:
###1381 "This is our territory!" "Oh no you're intruding!"
###1384 When all the states joined together, the government
###1386 worked out the lines of the states and they agreed.
###1390 That was the end of territorial disputes.
###1393 If you want the end of war, you must declare the Earth common heritage.
###1408 This has nothing to do with those who want to form an elite world order
###1413 with themselves and large corporations in control
###1417 and the rest of the world subservient to them.
###1421 On the contrary, a global Resource-Based Economy
###1424 enables all people to reach their highest potential
###1428 where they can thrive and grow in a society that works in their behalf
###1433 a society that protects and preserves the environment as well.
###1438 One that understands that we are part of nature, not separate from it.
###1453 (Narrator) Some question what would happen to incentive if needs were met
###1456 without our having to work to attain them.
###1459 The question assumes humans have no desires beyond basic needs.
###1463 If that were true, there would be no inventors
###1467 writers or teachers.
###1470 People work with passion on the things that interest and challenge them.
###1474 Let's enable all people to have the opportunity
###1477 to partake in the greatest challenge one can have:
###1480 improving our world for everyone.
###1484 Individuality will be emphasized rather than uniformity.
###1489 This social arrangement will generate a new incentive system
###1492 that values the protection of the environment and social concern
###1496 rather than the shallow self-centered goals
###1499 of wealth, property and power.
###1503 It does not call for uniformity. It absolutely calls for diversity:
###1508 the more diverse people are, the more individuality.
###1512 So we emphasize individuality, creativity, innovativeness.
###1517 This is the essentials of the design.
###1520 It is not a group of scientists telling people what to do
###1524 how to live, where to go, what to follow.
###1527 (Narrator) Motivation and incentive exist when people have meaningful tasks.
###1532 True growth and development occur when people are involved in creative
###1536 challenging and constructive endeavors.
###1539 However, motivation and incentive die in the daily grind
###1543 of boring and repetitive jobs required to earn a paycheck.
###1548 If you hand out things to people
###1550 if you fed them, clothed them and housed them for free
###1553 they're not going to work in the morning because they don't need it.
###1556 They've got their housing, clothing, motion pictures and entertainment.
###1559 Why go to work? Work is painful, it's monotonous, it's boring.
###1565 In the future, if people have access to all their needs
###1570 but they don't have any challenges, this is where it goes to pot.
###1574 So people constantly [will be] challenged by new things.
###1578 In our schools we challenge them with many things that are not solved
###1582 and [there are] many unresolved problems.
###1585 If you are well fed and well clothed, that doesn't stop your brain from working.
###1589 That would mean that every millionaire does nothing, it's turned off
###1592 because you've got all the means. That's not true.
###1595 There are many millionaires that work 18 hours a day
###1598 and don't have enough time. It has to do with your background
###1601 and your education. The more you know about oceanography, astronomy, etc.
###1605 the more interested, the more alive you are.
###1608 If you're just given food, clothing and shelter, now you can go to work.
###1611 You don't have to worry about making a living
###1613 and your incentive would be boosted considerably.
###1616 I call that a new and innovative incentive system:
###1620 it's not monetary oriented, it's problem-solving oriented.
###1625 You get your kicks out of seeing the world become a better place.
###1638 (Narrator) How can we use our technology wisely
###1641 so that there is more than enough for everyone?
###1645 To achieve this, it's mandatory that the planning for it
###1649 be based on the carrying capacity of the planet's resources.
###1655 Our entire infrastructure must be redesigned
###1658 and operated as coherent, integrated, total systems.
###1662 This means we must consider our entire global community as one unit
###1666 that includes everyone and plan accordingly.
###1669 Only in this way can we use our technology to overcome resource shortages
###1674 provide universal abundance and protect the environment.
###1681 Therefore, a global survey is first needed to assess exactly what we have.
###1686 This would inventory our physical resources, personnel
###1690 production centers and the needs of people.
###1694 This enables us to determine the amount of goods and services needed.
###1698 For instance, where is the arable land to grow crops?
###1702 How many people are in various locations
###1705 and what is the state of their health?
###1707 This would determine where hospitals are built and how many.
###1713 If you try to do that today
###1716 (ask for a global resource survey of all nations), they'd wonder
###1720 "What are you trying to do that for? To find if we've got enough resources
###1723 to fight you in armaments and other things?"
###1726 They would be skeptical, hesitant, to give that information.
###1730 So I would say it wouldn't work in today's culture.
###1733 But after the ideas are put forth and the reason for it
###1737 and the advantages gained by all the nations...
###1740 It would have to be specific advantages
###1742 that they can understand in their terms.
###1746 If they agree, then the survey would be conducted.
###1750 It's not my opinion or the opinion of anyone else that would be used.
###1754 It's the size of the population, the availability of resources
###1758 the carrying capacity of the Earth, that determines
###1761 what is done and how fast things move.
###1764 Today it's done on a totally different basis
###1768 but in the future it will all be based on
###1771 a form of dynamic equilibrium.
###1773 That means operating everything at the highest potential
###1778 without environmental neglect.
###1783 (Narrator) The key to achieving abundance and a high standard of living for all
###1787 is to automate as much as possible in the shortest period of time.
###1792 But during the transition, we have to bring together
###1797 the technological capabilities of people working with computers
###1802 and working with technology
###1805 and building and designing methods of delivering these resources
###1810 and the necessary industrial plants to process the resources.
###1816 (Narrator) Our problems and their solutions are technical, not political.
###1821 Most problems can be solved when technology and the methods of science
###1824 are used to serve all people, not just a select few.
###1829 What is it that you want? You have to ask yourself.
###1832 I want to live in a world where I don't have to fear
###1834 that my children will go into another war
###1838 where there will be deprivation, problems or disease.
###1841 "Do you know how to build that kind of world?" "No I don't!"
###1844 How do you go about building? You call upon the various divisions of science
###1848 bring them together and say "These are the problems we'd like to solve."
###1852 A scientific government doesn't mean that scientists rule or control people.
###1857 It means they have better means for building transportation systems
###1862 better means for cleaning the air, they have the best means
###1865 for restoring the oceans that we know of to this day.
###1872 (Narrator) Computers can serve the needs of everyone
###1874 when cybernation is ultimately integrated into all aspects
###1878 of this new and dynamic culture.
###1882 One can think of this as an electronic nervous system
###1885 extending into all areas of the social complex.
###1890 Their function would be to coordinate a balance between production and distribution
###1894 assuring there are no shortages or overruns.
###1899 (Roxanne Meadows) In this highly technical society
###1901 decisions are based on direct environmental
###1904 human and industrial feedback.
###1907 You can think of this as electrical sensors
###1909 throughout the entire environment
###1912 from cities, factories, warehouses
###1914 distribution centers, transportation networks
###1918 all over the globe gathering data for more appropriate decisions.
###1923 The decisions are based on the needs of society
###1926 rather than corporate or private interests.
###1931 (Narrator) It is not automated technology or machines we should be wary of
###1935 but the abuse and misuse of technology by selfish interests.
###1939 Remember, it is people who decide what ends the machines will serve.
###1945 If technology does not liberate all people
###1947 for the pursuit of higher aspirations in human achievement
###1950 then all its technological potential will be meaningless.
###1955 You always do a positive and negative study
###1958 before you engage in the actual reconstruction of an environment.
###1971 (Narrator) It's all just talk unless there is a technical plan
###1974 to organize and use resources to accomplish abundance.
###1980 What follows are some of the many approaches The Venus Project provides
###1984 for the entire social spectrum.
###1993 Today more than half our population lives in cities that are polluted
###1997 dangerous and waste energy.
###2001 What we have to do is design a city as a living system
###2004 as an organism, as a university:
###2007 that all the cities of the future will be university cities
###2010 that grow, that continue to exchange ideas.
###2013 The city will have a built-in transportation system so there are no accidents
###2018 and no unthought out areas of technology.
###2021 Medicine, botany, agriculture, the total system: one planning system.
###2028 (Narrator) It is actually better to build newer cities from the ground up
###2031 than to restore and maintain old ones.
###2037 Fresco uses a systems approach to designing new cities.
###2040 They're desirable and pleasant places to live.
###2046 The notion that intelligent overall planning implies mass uniformity is absurd.
###2052 Cities would be uniform only to the degree that they would require far less materials
###2056 save time and energy
###2059 and be flexible enough to allow for innovative changes
###2062 while preserving the local ecology.
###2067 If we design our cities to meet human needs
###2071 you don't have most of the problems that are prevalent today.
###2076 In the central dome you have childcare
###2080 schools, dental care, medical care.
###2084 In the production and design of the cities
###2087 we work out 1/8th of the city system and then we reproduce it
###2092 instead of having architects design each building and each structure
###2098 which is a tremendous waste of energy and talent.
###2105 (Narrator) When working on solving the housing problem for all the world's people
###2109 construction techniques would be vastly different from those employed today.
###2114 Extruded and self-erecting structures could revolutionize
###2117 and speed up construction processes.
###2121 These lightweight, durable apartments could be produced as continuous extrusions
###2126 and then separated and positioned in place by the mega-machines.
###2131 The outer shells of these efficient structures serve as photovoltaic generators
###2135 and heat concentrators.
###2139 You don't own anything in this society.
###2142 Really, people don't want money;
###2145 they want access to things when they want it.
###2148 People in a society of abundance, having access to things
###2153 will really no longer begin to store and accumulate things.
###2158 We recycle it, update it, make it better.
###2161 Take the same materials of an old car
###2164 [they] weigh just as much as a new car, so there are no old cars.
###2168 Old cars mean danger.
###2170 If you drive a very expensive car and somebody else drives a beat-up old car
###2175 if their brakes fail, you may die.
###2178 We don't want any old cars on the highway.
###2181 We don't want anything that breaks down.
###2183 We don't want anything that takes looking after.
###2187 (Narrator) In a Resource-Based Economy, people may access whatever products they need
###2191 without the burden of having to purchase, maintain or insure their possessions.
###2197 In this way, there is much more to go around for everyone
###2200 and products are always available when needed.
###2204 Anything people may need is available in these outside access domes:
###2211 sculpturing materials, musical instruments,
###2215 somewhat like a public library.
###2217 They can go down and access a camera, a bicycle or a wristwatch.
###2222 Anything they need is available without a price tag.
###2227 That would mean we must achieve a level of production that's so high
###2233 that scarcity no longer exists.
###2236 That will prevent almost all crime.
###2240 There is no way of segmenting or making this system just or equitable.
###2244 We have to make a system that assures human rights.
###2248 When everybody has free access to goods and services
###2251 you don't have to fight for women's rights, or black rights.
###2254 It's an automatic in a society that is set up that way.
###2257 You don't have to make laws [like] 'Don't steal'; it would bypass that behavior.
###2264 (Jacque Fresco) Surrounding the central dome, you have the research centers
###2268 centers that do work that's relevant
###2271 to the sustainability of the entire community.
###2275 As we move away from the research centers
###2278 we come to the recreational area
###2281 which has tennis courts and all of the games that people require.
###2291 As we move away from that we come to the residential district.
###2295 There are streams, waterfalls, lakes throughout the area.
###2307 (Narrator) We could provide a wide range of unique homes and apartments
###2310 that can be relatively maintenance free, fireproof
###2314 and virtually impervious to adverse weather conditions.
###2323 As we move to the next sector, we come to apartments.
###2327 The reason some people want to live in apartments
###2330 is because you have drama groups, you have gymnasiums
###2334 medical care, dental care; everything is built-in to the central towers.
###2339 I feel that in the future, people will move away from individual houses
###2344 and live in larger complexes.
###2348 As we move outward we come to the indoor agriculture
###2353 or hydroponic farms.
###2355 Then there is also outdoor agriculture.
###2361 (Narrator) The city would use the best of clean technology
###2364 in harmony with nature, such as wind, solar, geothermal
###2369 heat concentrators, piezoelectric, wave, temperature differentials
###2375 ocean thermal vents and much more.
###2379 A major development for generating energy in the future
###2382 could be the construction of a land bridge or tunnel across the Bering Strait.
###2390 These underwater structures convert a portion of the ocean currents
###2394 through turbines to generate clean sources of power.
###2398 By using these sources of energy we could power the earth on clean energy
###2402 and enable all people to enjoy a very high standard of living
###2405 for thousands of years to come.
###2408 There is no need for the use of polluting hydrocarbons any longer.
###2412 Pollution will be a thing of the past.
###2417 All transportation will be integrated into a worldwide transportation system.
###2423 Transportation within cities will be by transveyors.
###2431 City-to-city travel will be by monorail.
###2440 Maglev trains are utilized for long distance travel.
###2444 To enhance efficiency, this high-speed maglev train
###2447 is equipped with removable sections
###2450 which can be disengaged while the train is in motion.
###2454 Aircraft will display a wide range of configurations.
###2460 These VTOL aircraft (or Vertical Takeoff and Landing)
###2463 are used to transport passengers and freight.
###2467 The priority is safety rather than saving money
###2470 or dealing with the lowest bidder.
###2474 This modular freighter consists of detachable sections
###2477 that can be rapidly loaded or unloaded.
###2480 The number of sections varies depending on the amount of freight to be delivered.
###2485 When all the sections are connected they can be propelled as a single unit.
###2491 Ships can be floating manufacturing plants
###2493 that produce products while en route to their destinations.
###2497 They can also serve as education centers
###2500 where children and adults travel worldwide obtaining innovative education
###2505 not through vicarious study, but through experiencing
###2508 and interacting with the 'real-world' environment.
###2514 A national transportation system would include a network of waterways
###2518 canals and irrigation systems.
###2523 They could serve to minimize the threat of floods and droughts
###2526 while allowing for the migration of fish, provide natural firebreaks
###2530 emergency water sources, fish farms and recreation areas.
###2536 When we unleash science and technology
###2539 directly into the social system
###2541 without the restrictions of the market place, finances or patents
###2546 we could achieve a very high standard of living
###2549 within a very short period of time.
###2552 This society would continuously improve
###2555 changing rapidly through new technologies, inventions and ideas.
###2560 It would be an emergent society
###2563 rather than an established one like we have today.
###2570 (Narrator) Imagine living in an extraordinary oceanic city
###2573 helping to restore the ocean environment
###2576 while eliminating land-based population pressures.
###2584 These cities in the sea may serve as universities and research centers
###2589 where students study marine sciences.
###2594 They could be used for ocean farming, mariculture and mining
###2598 while maintaining a dynamic balance in the oceanographic environment.
###2604 Self-sufficient cities in the sea vary in design
###2608 depending on their location and function.
###2613 This undersea observation station permits people
###2616 to view marine life in its natural habitat.
###2621 These mariculture and sea-farming systems
###2623 cultivate and raise fish along with other forms of marine life
###2627 to help meet the nutritional needs of the world's people.
###2632 These structures would permit the free flow of water throughout.
###2639 Using technology in this way would make it possible for a global society
###2643 to achieve social advancement and worldwide reconstruction
###2647 in the shortest time possible.
###2650 Utopia, if it's ever established, will die, will stagnate.
###2656 Whereas what I'm talking about is an evolving culture
###2660 or an emergent culture.
###2662 I have no notions of a perfect society. I don't know what that means.
###2666 I know we can do much better than what we've got.
###2669 I'm no Utopian. I'm not... a humanist
###2672 that would like to see everybody living in warmth and harmony.
###2676 [But] I know that if we don't live that way, we'll kill each other and destroy the Earth.
###2681 (Narrator) This new lifestyle, while providing leisure and recreation
###2685 would also enhance knowledge and creativity for everyone.
###2689 The measure of success would be the fulfillment of one's personal interests
###2693 rather than the acquisition of wealth and self-centered goals.
###2699 A Resource-Based Economy would not only change our environment
###2703 to make it clean, efficient and enjoyable
###2706 but it would introduce a new value system
###2708 appropriate to the direction and aims of the new innovative approach.
###2713 With education and resources made available
###2716 there would be no limit to the human potential.
###2719 Everyone will have the freedom to pursue
###2721 whatever constructive field of endeavor he or she chooses
###2725 without the economic limitations that we face today.
###2732 We are now at a time when decisions must be made
###2736 if we wish to evolve from our present culture of scarcity
###2741 waste and environmental destruction
###2745 to a sustainable society of ecological concern and abundance.
###2751 A nation without a vision of what the future can be
###2755 is bound to repeat past errors
###2757 over and over again.
###2764 We say dishonestly
###2767 that man is the highest form of evolution which [is what] you get in schools.
###2771 Man destroys the oceans, the fish, the atmosphere and one another.
###2776 Man flies over a city, presses a button
###2780 and burns everybody in the city with nuclear weapons.
###2783 Is he the highest creation of nature? Not yet!
###2786 in my opinion. We've got a long way to go.
###2789 We could either develop paradise on Earth or oblivion;
###2793 wipe ourselves out, only the future will tell.
###2797 It's what you do to make the future.
###2803 (Narrator) We can create a world where war and want are distant memories.
###2809 When all of science and technology are used
###2812 within a global resource-based economy
###2815 for the protection of the environment and the well-being of all
###2820 only then will we understand
###2823 what it means to be truly civilized.
###2836 Be a part of the growing community of people
###2838 working toward making the aims of The Venus Project a reality.
###2842 Join us in our efforts to bring this vision of a positive future
###2846 to a wider audience through the goal of a major motion picture.
###2851 All of these things can be built with what we know today.
###2855 It would take 10 years to change the surface of the Earth
###2858 to rebuild the world into a second Garden of Eden.
###2861 The choice lies with you. The stupidity of a nuclear arms race
###2865 the development of weapons, trying to solve your problems politically
###2868 by electing this political party or that political party...
###2871 ALL politics are immersed in corruption.
###2874 Let me say it again: Communism, Socialism
###2877 Fascism, the Democrats, the Liberals.
###2880 There are no Negro problems, Polish problems or Jewish problems
###2884 or Greek problems or women's problems. They're human problems!
