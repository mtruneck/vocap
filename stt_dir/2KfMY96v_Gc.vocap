###19 CHRIS HARRIS: So I bought an Audi S4.
###21 And I've done so for several reasons.
###25 First up, it used to belong to a family member.
###27 So it is in a disgusting state of repair.
###30 Remember the Zero [BLEEP]
###31 Given RX7?
###32 This is the Zero [BLEEP]
###33 Given Audi S4.
###35 I challenge anyone to present to me an S4 in worse condition
###39 than this car.
###40 Its bodywork is ruined.
###41 Pretty much every panel's got a dent or a scratch in it.
###44 Inside, it's been lived in by two big, hairy,
###46 smelly, mostly wet dogs.
###48 And it stinks.
###49 You know what?
###50 We need a better camera car this year because the old
###52 Passat was just too slow, too much of the time.
###55 The car wasn't too expensive.
###56 That's two reasons.
###58 Third reason, the S4, as you now know, is a car I've always
###61 really admired.
###62 And I quite fancy one because it's low-key, and yet it's
###65 very fast and compact.
###67 Fourth reason, people keep telling me that you can
###69 extract more power from these things quite easily.
###73 I haven't tuned a car since I was quite a bit younger.
###76 And I quite like the idea of having something
###78 that's a bit stealthy.
###79 So I went to a place called REVO Technik.
###82 And they said to me, that they'd had better results with
###86 changing the software on the Audi S4 V8 model than
###89 virtually any other car they'd ever played with.
###92 So I thought, let's go along there, have them play with the
###94 software, maybe stick some brakes on it, and see what we
###98 end up with.
###99 Now, what car do you match against an S4 to find out if
###103 it really is performing to a higher level?
###106 What's a higher level of S4?
###108 It's an RS4.
###110 So I thought, we'd go and find out how a REVO software-mapped
###116 S4 performed against an Audi RS4.
###119 
###121 What I have here is the quite beautiful-looking new B8 RS4,
###127 450 horsepower from a normally-aspirated V8 engine
###131 four-wheel drive with launch control.
###133 And I'm looking at two miles of Bruntingthorpe straight
###136 ahead of me.
###136 To my right is my raggedy old Series 1 B8 Audi S4,
###141 supercharged 3-liter V6.
###144 And it's got a standard engine in it at the moment.
###146 I say, "at the moment." That has 333 horsepower.
###148 So we've got a big advantage here.
###150 And that doesn't have any launch control.
###152 Neil, now, hopefully, will set us on our way.
###156 
###160 [CAR REVVING]
###165 CHRIS HARRIS: And it's an annihilation at the moment.
###169 We've crucified him off the line.
###171 And now, we're just [CAR ENGINE ROARING]
###172 edging ahead.
###174 What's the gap?
###175 I don't know.
###176 Looking in my mirror, 15?
###177 What, 10 car lengths?
###179 15 car lengths?
###180 I mean, it's just a long, long way behind.
###185 We're now pulling 147, 149, 150, 154, 156, 160.
###193 Still going, where's the limiter?
###195 163, 164, 165.
###199 There's no limiter, 167.
###204 I think we can safely say that that was an annihilation.
###207 It's a different league of speed.
###211 But when we go back to the pit area, there's a man called
###215 Kevin, who's going to plug his widget or his dongle, whatever
###219 he calls it, into the ECU of the S4 and make it perform a
###224 little bit differently.
###226 And then we'll have another race.
###228 Quite looking forward to this.
###230 Look what it takes to make a B8 S4 go from 333 horsepower
###236 to, let's say, something beginning with a four.
###238 Watch this.
###238 It'll blow your mind.
###239 Kev, show me.
###240 KEVIN: Ignition on.
###243 Switch into performance mode with your SPS.
###245 [SUSTAINED BEEPING]
###246 CHRIS HARRIS: Make a beep.
###247 
###249 KEVIN: Find the diagnostic port.
###250 [ELECTRONIC BLIPS]
###252 KEVIN: The bleep indicates that we're switched to
###254 performance mode.
###255 CHRIS HARRIS: And that's it?
###256 Engine on.
###258 KEVIN: Off we go.
###259 CHRIS HARRIS: So 30, 40 years ago, you did cams.
###261 You did pistons.
###263 You did intake.
###265 You did exhaust.
###266 Now, you-- you give me that, please.
###270 Look at that.
###271 Isn't that extraordinary?
###273 Right.
###273 So will the old dog snotter now match an RS4?
###278 We shall go and find out.
###279 
###281 Seconds out, round two.
###284 I have 450 horsepower in my RS4.
###287 It hasn't changed.
###289 However, the S4 now has a bit more horsepower.
###292 I don't know what the dyno figures are, but I'm led to
###294 believe it might have something in the region of 400
###297 horsepower and a lot of torque.
###300 So let's see what happens.
###301 
###314 [CAR ENGINES REVVING]
###317 CHRIS HARRIS: There he goes.
###318 I mean, off the line, it's almost identical.
###322 I gave him as much as I could because
###324 I've got launch control.
###324 But look at this now.
###326 We're just level bagging.
###329 I've got a little bit of a margin in there.
###332 But it's tiny.
###335 We're just poking each other.
###338 Can you see him?
###339 
###343 Maybe, I'm taking a yard out of him there.
###345 A yard?
###347 You see the bonnet popping up on the old girl a bit.
###350 Maybe, two yards.
###353 Not really, is it?
###354 166 miles an hour.
###363 166 miles an hour.
###366 And there was, I reckon, there were, what?
###370 Two, three yards in it by the end.
###372 Isn't that extraordinary.
###375 I'm a little bit speechless.
###378 So to recap, the 3-liter supercharged Audi engine is
###383 something else.
###384 It really does offer a huge scope with tunability.
###389 So we've taken a very ordinary Audi S4, put a bit of software
###395 to it, and we've ended up with a car that is absolutely as
###398 quick as the brand-new RS4.
###401 Does that take anything away from the RS4?
###405 Suppose in some ways it does because a halo product, an
###409 absolute alpha male like the RS4 shouldn't really have any
###413 competition from within its own model range.
###415 But it's the beauty of forced induction is that you'll never
###419 get round it, this razor-sharp 8,400 RPM V8 that makes those
###425 lovely noises.
###426 [ENGINE ROARS]
###427 CHRIS HARRIS: It's an amazing engine, but it restricts
###431 anyone messing around with it afterwards.
###432 There's not so much you can do with it.
###434 However, when you start playing with supercharged
###437 engines-- there's a suspicion that Audi would've held that
###439 thing back anyway to give it a gap between
###441 the S4 and the RS4.
###443 Once these clever blokes start messing around with laptops
###447 and working out how they can make them boost better and do
###449 other things, I don't know.
###450 It's all black magic to me.
###452 They can make them perform, can't they?
###455 So this car now owes me less than 20,000 pounds and will do
###460 naught to 100 miles an hour in 9.4 seconds and
###464 will match an RS4.
###467 I think that's quite an impressive little estate car.
###470 
###473 We had a new toy to play with for the timed runs as clever
###476 bods at Racelogic have created the VBOX Sport, which is a
###480 water and bash-proof sensor that clips to your windscreen.
###484 And it's Bluetooth connected to an app on your iPhone.
###488 Very cool and very convenient.
###492 The RS4's launch control is subtle.
###494 It slightly rides the clutch, then you feel a little slip
###497 from the rear wheels, and then it just bolts away.
###501 Gear shifts from the jewel clutch box are imperceptible.
###504 And the numbers are impressive.
###506 Zero to 30 takes just 1.67 seconds.
###510 60 takes 4.12 seconds.
###513 And the zero to 100 time is a sharp 9.42 seconds.
###518 The NFG S4 has no launch control.
###522 It's an early car.
###523 You just mash the right pedal and hope the smell of wet dog
###526 will disappear.
###527 The gearbox is far less crisp as well.
###530 First to second is noticeably slower than in the RS4.
###532 But from then on, it rips down the runway in a way that must
###536 make it the small estate car bargain of the year.
###540 Get this, naught to 30 in 1.73 seconds; 60 in 4.17 seconds;
###546 and 100 in 9.48 seconds, just 6/100 of a second slower than
###552 the RS4 to 100 miles an hour.
###556 With the standard software--
###557 just to show you-- the S4 ran 60 in 4.7 seconds, and 100 in
###562 11.3 seconds.
###564 Still impressive, but miles off the REVO-adjusted version.
###568 How much power does it have?
###570 I don't really care, actually, so long as it does the numbers
###573 on the flat.
###573 But it must have well over 400 horsepower now.
###577 With so much extra poke, we're trying some Stasis 370 mil
###581 front brakes with 6-piston calipers.
###583 They fit behind the standard rims, and are miles better
###585 than the stock at full brakes.
###587 The only other mods are thicker rear anti-roll bar and
###590 an optional exhaust, which sounds a little fruitier and
###593 ditches the slightly pathetic S4 tailpipes.
###595 It's a bit shiny right now.
###597 But the strict "no washing" regime will soon fix that.
###601 Here's a breakdown of the costs.
###605 Now, I need to be absolutely clear.
###607 This exercise is about showing just what you can squeeze from
###611 an S4 with very little work.
###612 It's not about belittling the RS4.
###615 Of course, in comparing it to the RS4, I'm naturally
###618 slightly exposing some of its performance, let's say,
###621 "deficit" compared to the car that's
###624 lower down in the range.
###625 But I'm not trying to take the mickey out of the RS4, for the
###628 simple reason that the RS4 is a lovely car.
###630 But by heck, is it a confusing car!
###634 Neil and I have spent several days in this thing now.
###636 And it really is like the sort of beautiful,
###639 boyfriend-girlfriend situation that isn't actually all the
###643 personality you might want it to be.
###646 On the road, the steering can be really
###648 odd, the dynamic steering.
###649 The chassis, when it's in Comfort mode, it's a bit loose
###652 and doesn't ride that well.
###654 When you put it in Dynamic mode, I don't know what they
###655 were thinking.
###656 I mean, you just simply can't drive it.
###658 It's so firm.
###659 The engine's so exciting and wants to rev, and yet it
###662 doesn't have anything like as much torque as the S4.
###666 And you have to really be up it the whole time.
###669 But this is the big problem with the RS4, every time you
###672 see it, you completely fall in love with it because it's so
###676 good looking.
###677 And as an object, it's just gorgeous.
###679 The interior is beautiful.
###681 It's a car that I'd love to have outside my door all year
###685 long, but probably for all the wrong reasons.
###688 And of course, anyone looking to spend between 60,000 and
###691 70,000 pounds on a new small estate car isn't looking to go
###695 and buy a used S4 and chip it up and do the
###698 things that I've done.
###699 So there isn't really a comparison there at all.
###701 The RS4 really is a flawed diamond.
###705 But it proves that these Audi RS products are
###707 very hit and miss.
###709 We're going to drive an R8 B10 soon, and
###711 that's a bit of kick.
###713 The RS4, I think, is in many ways quite the compromised
###717 driving machine, but a beautiful object.
