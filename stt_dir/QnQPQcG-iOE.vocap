###7 Summer 1492.
###12 After three months at sea
###13 the Santa Maria, the Pinta and the Ni√±a anchor off the Bahamas.
###19 Europe has found the Americas.
###29 Next comes conquest and colonization by settlers who remake America in their image.
###45 They advance and destroy.
###56 But there is another story about the animals and plants they bring here.
###68 And the natural treasures they find here.
###76 And how the Americas are completely transformed.
###82 It all began five hundred years ago.
###116 It's 1491.
###119 A year from now Christopher Columbus will set foot on this quiet beach.
###125 What's here before he arrives is a world of unbelievable natural wealth.
###132 Two vast continents teeming with life.
###139 More than six hundred thousand miles of coastline are surrounded by pristine waters.
###146 Shoals so dense they're said to slow the passage of ships.
###155 Countless species numbered in their tens of millions.
###160 Inland from the atlantic shores
###163 great forests stretch in every direction.
###168 This new world is a land of stark contrasts.
###180 From the lush jungles of South-America
###183 to the glaciers of the Arctic north.
###185 and the great plains of the midwest where gigantic herds
###190 thunder across North-America
###193 There is room for caribou, antilope, bison and the giant grizzly.
###214  In the sky above flocks of birds nearly block out the sun.
###217 as millions of pigeons, ducks and geese cover the horizon.
###226 No one in Europe has dared imagine the magnificent bounty that exists
###232 on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.
###245 In 1491
###246 Christopher Columbus stands on the coast of Spain, looking west.
###251 He dreams of leading an expedition to find a new trade route to Asia.
###259 Success will mean glory and riches for himself and the Spanish monarchy.
###275 In Europe the nobles have grown wealthy by trading with the east.
###279 Spices and gold, gemstones and silk,
###282 are the most lucrative goods.
###285 But Europeans have lost the silk road to the Turks and foreign trade is in decline.
###291 The wealth of kings is in danger.
###295 Isabella, queen of Spain,
###297 is desperate to find new routes to India.
###301 And she has a plan.
###306 Isabella is the most powerful woman in Europe,
###309 a continent of expanding horizons filled with competitive and inventive souls.
###315 For five hundred years they have been building castles, palaces and centres of trade.
###322 Kings and popes have raised armies to fight each other and their enemies on Europe's borders.
###331 Nowhere else are rivalries so intense.
###334 Gold fever is so widespread,
###336 religious fervour and business expertise
###338 as tightly wound as in Europe in 1491.
###344 Ideas are moving forward,
###346 curiosity and the thirst for power
###348 pushes Europe's limits.
###361 Europe is a busy and crowded continent,
###363 trying to feed a growing population
###366 of one hundred million people.
###369 Natural resources are already exploited as land becomes scarce and overworked.
###376 Most of the peasants are farmers working land that belongs to someone else,
###383 owned by the nobles or the Church.
###388 Their main diet is bread and porridge,
###391 both made from harvesting grains.
###395 They plant rye or wheat in winter,
###399 oats or barley in the spring.
###403 And every third year the field lies fallow to regenerate.
###413 They've learned to harness water and wind for power.
###419 It is hard work
###420 but good for producing higher yields in smaller spaces.
###431 This agricultural revolution allows the European population to grow.
###442 With the help of one more important element:
###449 domesticated animals.
###458 Horses  pull ploughs,
###461 cattle provide meat, fur and hides.
###467 The pig is a main source of meat and leather.
###477 And so too are sheep.
###487 And the mules can pull a cart.
###493 Cows also give them milk, butter and cheese.
###510 It is not only people that domesticate animals.
###515 The big five: horses, cattle, goats, pigs and sheep domesticate the European landscape.
###526 They contribute to Europe's overcrowded conditions.
###532 In 1491 the Americas too are a crowded and prosperous place.
###538 But in a very different way.
###544 The Andes cradled a vast empire ruled by powerful god kings.
###552 Messoamerica is densely populated and home to the most impressive civilizations on the continent.
###561 The atlantic coast is filled with smaller villages and fields.
###568 And along the great rivers great cities are built around monumental plazas.
###575 It is an ancient world
###577 inhabited by one hundred million people,
###582 hunters and gatherers,
###584 fishermen and farmers,
###586 kings, slaves and soldiers.
###593 Down among the trees,
###595 where the Missouri, Illinois and Mississippi rivers merge,
###599 lies one of the largest civilizations on the continent.
###605 The native Mississippians are mound builders occupying a vast region
###609 from the great lakes in the north
###612 to Florida in the south.
###617 The first explorers thought these great mounds were natural, carved by retreating glaciers.
###623 Now we know that they are the centerpieces of cities.
###628 Cities like Cahokia, busy trading posts of earth and wood,
###636 with populations of up to thousands of people.
###644 No one knows what they called themselves or what language they spoke.
###652 But we know why were they successful.
###658 These Mississippians are farmers.
###662 Their staple crop is fuel
###664 for the ever growing population.
###666 It is a plant native to the Americas unknown to the rest of the world.
###678 But corn is not a blessing from nature or a gift of the gods.
###683 This crop is the outcome of man's first feat of genetic engineering.
###693 Once they learned how to grow it, they could stay in one place.
###698 This simple diet
###700 translated straight into the energy to build a civilization.
###709 The cultivation of corn
###711 is the key to flourishing cultures in the Americas before Columbus.
###717 The staple crop in North-America was corn.
###720 Six thousand years ago ears of corn were only about as long as a person's thumb.
###724 and they were barely edible. It took thousands of years to develop a more
###728 nourishing and larger hybrid and also a hybrid that can grow in cooler climates,
###733 outside Messoamerica.
###735 It wasn't until about eleven hundred years ago that corn reached the Mississippi river valley.
###741 Corn is the result of the domestication of the wild teosinte grass.
###749 Early Americans started with this spindly stock.
###754 And over the centuries they developed it into today's giant corn.
###762 Archaeologists and biologists are still debating how corn was achieved
###768 out of a tiny grass.
###771 Corn is one of the keys to understanding American civilization.
###775 Wherever it flourishes
###777 so do great cultures.
###779 Yet the greatest American empire of them all is found where corn cannot grow.
###785 High in the Andes.
###794 The Inca empire stretches nearly two thousand five hundred miles down the west coast of South-America.
###800 Inca built palaces, storehouses and castles in the tall mountains.
