0:0:0,79 --> 0:0:2,58
Today, we've got a
guy turning China

JACOB SOBOROFF:
Competitive gaming is huge.


12
0:0:25,2 --> 0:0:27,53
Over 30 million people
watched the League of Legends


13
0:0:27,53 --> 0:0:29,969
season three
championship-- 30 million.


14
0:0:29,969 --> 0:0:31,1
Season four starts today.


15
0:0:31,1 --> 0:0:33,262
But old school gaming, it
is alive and well, too.


16
0:0:33,262 --> 0:0:34,97
Motherboard from VICE
made this short doc


17
0:0:34,97 --> 0:0:37,8
about one of the greatest
rivalries in gaming history,


18
0:0:37,8 --> 0:0:41,0
ironically, between a plastic
surgeon and a bodybuilder.

VINCENT: Now, I don't want
to see Hank win again.


20
0:0:43,18 --> 0:0:46,12
But I think that if I
win, people will never


21
0:0:46,12 --> 0:0:49,6
be mad to see me win, because,
I mean, come on, look at me.


22
0:0:49,6 --> 0:0:52,34
HANK: I don't feel like
Vincent is nipping at my heels.


23
0:0:52,34 --> 0:0:53,95
I'm not too worried about him.


24
0:0:53,95 --> 0:0:56,325
No matter what score he puts
up, I could probably top it.

JACOB SOBOROFF:
Competitive "Donkey Kong"


26
0:0:58,33 --> 0:1:0,487
went mainstream in 2007 with
the cult hit "King of Kong."


27
0:1:0,487 --> 0:1:2,7
And this picks up
where that left off.


28
0:1:2,7 --> 0:1:4,839
HANK: My mind is just
cluttered with barrels.


29
0:1:4,839 --> 0:1:7,55



30
0:1:7,55 --> 0:1:9,9
VINCENT: Who's going to win,
the muscle or the brain?


31
0:1:9,9 --> 0:1:11,71
And of course, the
muscle will win.


32
0:1:11,71 --> 0:1:13,668
JACOB SOBOROFF: Watch to
see these titans clash


33
0:1:13,668 --> 0:1:15,467
and find out who wins.

BEN: I've seen a
million skate videos,


35
0:1:17,5 --> 0:1:18,69
but I've never seen
anything like this.


36
0:1:18,69 --> 0:1:19,8
I shared it as soon as I saw it.

They call this foot
twerking in the description,


38
0:1:21,93 --> 0:1:24,55
but it's pretty much just
doing unbelievable tricks


39
0:1:24,55 --> 0:1:25,48
on long boards
that are so heavy,


40
0:1:25,48 --> 0:1:27,105

used for cruising.

JACOB SOBOROFF: Last weekend,
the Dallas Safari Club


46
0:1:43,1 --> 0:1:46,15
auctioned off a permit to hunt
the endangered African black


47
0:1:46,15 --> 0:1:46,78
rhino.


48
0:1:46,78 --> 0:1:47,33
Really?


49
0:1:47,33 --> 0:1:49,6
Thankfully, this next video
is the opposite of that.


50
0:1:49,6 --> 0:1:52,159
A British wildlife photographer
built this tiny helicopter


51
0:1:52,159 --> 0:1:53,2
that's flying the camera.


52
0:1:53,2 --> 0:1:55,533
He controls it remotely while
he's watching a live feed.

over half a mile.

of feels like "The Lion


56

King" in real life.

that inner scream

someone tries to show you

changing the game.
