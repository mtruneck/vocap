0:0:16,76 --> 0:0:19,76
STEFAN RUIZ: For me, what I've
always been interested in is


3
0:0:19,76 --> 0:0:23,5
this contrast between rich
and poor, between--


4
0:0:23,5 --> 0:0:24,87
just the craziness
of the world.


5
0:0:24,87 --> 0:0:27,78
How different people live
different ways.


6
0:0:27,78 --> 0:0:28,68
People are the same.


7
0:0:28,68 --> 0:0:30,3
People are different.


8
0:0:30,3 --> 0:0:34,9
But just to try to photograph,
in a similar way, all these


9
0:0:34,9 --> 0:0:37,89
different things, and let them
speak for themselves.


10
0:0:37,89 --> 0:0:50,66



11
0:0:50,66 --> 0:0:53,98
I would say people think of me
as a portrait photographer--


12
0:0:53,98 --> 0:0:54,42
Well, no.


13
0:0:54,42 --> 0:0:54,89
It's weird.


14
0:0:54,89 --> 0:0:57,73
Because some people think of me
as a portrait photographer.


15
0:0:57,73 --> 0:1:2,5
Other people think of me as a
landscape travel photographer.


16
0:1:2,5 --> 0:1:4,48
So I kind of like that,
because they


17
0:1:4,48 --> 0:1:5,66
don't always cross.


18
0:1:5,66 --> 0:1:9,4
I think in the States,
especially, I'm considered


19
0:1:9,4 --> 0:1:13,88
this third world photographer,
who photographs down and outs


20
0:1:13,88 --> 0:1:14,38
or something.


21
0:1:14,38 --> 0:1:15,63
I don't really know.


22
0:1:15,63 --> 0:1:19,58
I do tons of celebrity portraits
for the Sunday


23
0:1:19,58 --> 0:1:21,76
newspaper magazines in the UK.


24
0:1:21,76 --> 0:1:24,2
I photographed James
Brown for them.


25
0:1:24,2 --> 0:1:26,17
I photographed P Diddy.


26
0:1:26,17 --> 0:1:27,32
Liza Minnelli.


27
0:1:27,32 --> 0:1:27,61
I don't know.


28
0:1:27,61 --> 0:1:29,74
All kinds of people.


29
0:1:29,74 --> 0:1:32,21
I'm still pretty shy, but
I was really shy.


30
0:1:32,21 --> 0:1:36,73
And for me to meet people, or
do anything, the good thing


31
0:1:36,73 --> 0:1:39,93
with photography, and working
for magazines, or just


32
0:1:39,93 --> 0:1:42,71
travelling and going on these
things was I was thrown into


33
0:1:42,71 --> 0:1:46,11
these situations where
I just had to deal.


34
0:1:46,11 --> 0:1:46,8
And I like that.


35
0:1:46,8 --> 0:1:50,59
And I like the fact that I get
sent places, and from one week


36
0:1:50,59 --> 0:1:52,6
to the next, I'm not really sure
who I'm going to meet,


37
0:1:52,6 --> 0:1:53,63
where I'm going to go.


38
0:1:53,63 --> 0:1:56,15
And I'll do advertising.


39
0:1:56,15 --> 0:1:57,97
I'll do my own stuff.


40
0:1:57,97 --> 0:2:1,17
I'll do portraits of
celebrities, or poor people,


41
0:2:1,17 --> 0:2:3,53
or I'll do some kind of
documentary thing.


42
0:2:3,53 --> 0:2:6,45
And for me, it's always
interesting.


43
0:2:6,45 --> 0:2:12,51



44
0:2:12,51 --> 0:2:15,5
I'm definitely a hoarder,
a collector.


45
0:2:15,5 --> 0:2:16,28
It runs in the family.


46
0:2:16,28 --> 0:2:20,46
My mom is a crazy hoarder.


47
0:2:20,46 --> 0:2:22,35
It's so hard for me to
throw anything away.


48
0:2:22,35 --> 0:2:25,7
But at the same time, I travel
all the time, and I've gotten


49
0:2:25,7 --> 0:2:29,95
quite good at going places and
buying things that you can't


50
0:2:29,95 --> 0:2:31,79
really find in other
places, or it's


51
0:2:31,79 --> 0:2:33,65
harder to, or whatever.


52
0:2:33,65 --> 0:2:35,5
I buy photographs.


53
0:2:35,5 --> 0:2:39,21
I buy things that I think
are weird I buy anything


54
0:2:39,21 --> 0:2:40,42
portrait-based.


55
0:2:40,42 --> 0:2:40,7
Cups.


56
0:2:40,7 --> 0:2:41,56
I don't know.


57
0:2:41,56 --> 0:2:45,42
I bought five jockey coffee mugs
the other day, because


58
0:2:45,42 --> 0:2:47,55
they're portraits of jockeys.


59
0:2:47,55 --> 0:2:49,14
It's just retarded.


60
0:2:49,14 --> 0:2:51,5
I like this one, because he's
kind of like Burt Reynolds.


61
0:2:51,5 --> 0:2:54,29
I don't know why I collect
portraits.


62
0:2:54,29 --> 0:2:57,66
I think that portraits just kind
of work, aesthetically.


63
0:2:57,66 --> 0:3:0,2
Some of this is from Mexico,
South Africa.


64
0:3:0,2 --> 0:3:2,15
I've got my Pablo Escobars.


65
0:3:2,15 --> 0:3:5,55
We've got Robin Hood, and him as
a businessman or a Senator,


66
0:3:5,55 --> 0:3:7,77
and then him casual.


67
0:3:7,77 --> 0:3:10,5
They're made by a guy
in [INAUDIBLE].


68
0:3:10,5 --> 0:3:10,86
This is from Mexico.


69
0:3:10,86 --> 0:3:13,12
These are some of my favorite
types of photographs.


70
0:3:13,12 --> 0:3:15,25
These are these carved
old photographs.


71
0:3:15,25 --> 0:3:16,555
I've got a bunch of them.


72
0:3:16,555 --> 0:3:18,1
They're really fragile.


73
0:3:18,1 --> 0:3:20,56
A lot of them are really old.


74
0:3:20,56 --> 0:3:22,78
These are photos I
bought in Egypt.


75
0:3:22,78 --> 0:3:25,14
So these are Egypt
in the '70s.


76
0:3:25,14 --> 0:3:28,54
Yeah, they're hand-colored
from the '70s.


77
0:3:28,54 --> 0:3:30,94
They got a little wild
there in the end.


78
0:3:30,94 --> 0:3:35,62
But I'm into studio
photography.


79
0:3:35,62 --> 0:3:37,84
I got this in Colombia.


80
0:3:37,84 --> 0:3:43,22
I think it's a photographer's
advertisement for his skills.


81
0:3:43,22 --> 0:3:44,44
I like this one.


82
0:3:44,44 --> 0:3:46,205
We have the butt.


83
0:3:46,205 --> 0:3:48,365
We have the beer being poured.


84
0:3:48,365 --> 0:3:51,21
I like that one.


85
0:3:51,21 --> 0:3:53,93
Or that.


86
0:3:53,93 --> 0:3:55,37
What else?


87
0:3:55,37 --> 0:3:57,64
I collect records as well.


88
0:3:57,64 --> 0:3:59,84
This is Gal Costa.


89
0:3:59,84 --> 0:4:1,0
I also like this one, though.


90
0:4:1,0 --> 0:4:4,264
This is one of my favorites
of the moment right now.


91
0:4:4,264 --> 0:4:9,12
The salsa is my law, really.


92
0:4:9,12 --> 0:4:14,36
This is Patrick, trusted
assistant for years now.


93
0:4:14,36 --> 0:4:16,13
I'm from San Francisco.


94
0:4:16,13 --> 0:4:18,1
I went to university
in Santa Cruz.


95
0:4:18,1 --> 0:4:21,7
I studied drawing and painting,
and I got into


96
0:4:21,7 --> 0:4:23,41
photography kind
of by accident.


97
0:4:23,41 --> 0:4:31,79
I worked for a professor of mine
in Northeast Ivory Coast.


98
0:4:31,79 --> 0:4:34,25
That first trip, I didn't
consider myself a


99
0:4:34,25 --> 0:4:35,6
photographer.


100
0:4:35,6 --> 0:4:37,73
I liked taking pictures, but
I just wanted to travel.


101
0:4:37,73 --> 0:4:40,37
I think that's how I got
into photography.


102
0:4:40,37 --> 0:4:42,97
The first photos I took
were actually there.


103
0:4:42,97 --> 0:4:44,83
I went back to California.


104
0:4:44,83 --> 0:4:45,95
I had no money.


105
0:4:45,95 --> 0:4:47,17
I got a job in a bar.


106
0:4:47,17 --> 0:4:51,24
And while I was working in the
restaurant, I was also


107
0:4:51,24 --> 0:4:57,9
teaching drawing and painting at
San Quentin, at the prison.


108
0:4:57,9 --> 0:5:0,11
And then I really wanted to take
pictures of them, so I


109
0:5:0,11 --> 0:5:2,3
started taking all
these photos.


110
0:5:2,3 --> 0:5:6,73
And then I put this whole little
notebook together.


111
0:5:6,73 --> 0:5:8,45
And I would carry this box.


112
0:5:8,45 --> 0:5:10,89
This was before laptops,
everything.


113
0:5:10,89 --> 0:5:13,45
Maybe I'd changed boxes
at one point, but this


114
0:5:13,45 --> 0:5:16,58
is basically it.


115
0:5:16,58 --> 0:5:20,25
I used to bring this to Europe
with me all the time.


116
0:5:20,25 --> 0:5:26,8
And then I would show this, and
this is how I'd get jobs.


117
0:5:26,8 --> 0:5:30,71
So these are a couple of
guys from my class.


118
0:5:30,71 --> 0:5:34,92
5150s, clinically insane.


119
0:5:34,92 --> 0:5:39,34
So these are all from the
early '90s, I'd say.


120
0:5:39,34 --> 0:5:41,86
In London, you'd always have
meetings in the pub.


121
0:5:41,86 --> 0:5:45,21
And as I'd get more and more
drunk, eventually I would


122
0:5:45,21 --> 0:5:46,79
start showing my photos
to people.


123
0:5:46,79 --> 0:5:51,36
And one of the guys, he started
doing "Caterpillar."


124
0:5:51,36 --> 0:5:56,26
And he basically hired me to do
photos like my photos from


125
0:5:56,26 --> 0:5:58,22
the prison for caterpillar.


126
0:5:58,22 --> 0:6:1,89
That's when I first started
really making some money, and


127
0:6:1,89 --> 0:6:5,53
start figuring, maybe I could
make a living at photography.


128
0:6:5,53 --> 0:6:8,18
The guy I worked with on
"Caterpillar," he started


129
0:6:8,18 --> 0:6:12,68
working at "Camper." And then
he hired me for the first


130
0:6:12,68 --> 0:6:14,13
campaign he did there.


131
0:6:14,13 --> 0:6:17,79
And I did six campaigns with
"Camper." He wanted something


132
0:6:17,79 --> 0:6:22,24
a little bit quirky, and he
gave us a lot of freedom.


133
0:6:22,24 --> 0:6:22,92
Tons of freedom.


134
0:6:22,92 --> 0:6:25,0
It seemed like we could
do anything we wanted.


135
0:6:25,0 --> 0:6:28,9
And then, when I was probably on
the fifth or sixth campaign


136
0:6:28,9 --> 0:6:33,21
for "Camper," I was asked to
be creative director at


137
0:6:33,21 --> 0:6:34,36
"Colors."


138
0:6:34,36 --> 0:6:37,71
"Colors" was this magazine that
took things, and each


139
0:6:37,71 --> 0:6:38,73
issue had a theme.


140
0:6:38,73 --> 0:6:40,36
Whether it was war,
or whatever.


141
0:6:40,36 --> 0:6:44,76
And instead of doing a type of
documentary photography that


142
0:6:44,76 --> 0:6:47,55
was probably seen a lot at that
time, we were trying to


143
0:6:47,55 --> 0:6:50,61
do a more polished image
of this thing.


144
0:6:50,61 --> 0:6:54,44
Not artificial, but just,
maybe, well-lit,


145
0:6:54,44 --> 0:6:57,9
well-composed, hopefully
respect.


146
0:6:57,9 --> 0:6:59,55
Quite interesting to look at.


147
0:6:59,55 --> 0:7:2,41
I'd take the same equipment I
would take to photograph some


148
0:7:2,41 --> 0:7:5,1
celebrity, I would take
on my ad jobs.


149
0:7:5,1 --> 0:7:8,12
And I would set it up pretty
much the same way.


150
0:7:8,12 --> 0:7:10,69
But you're photographing
a refugee, or


151
0:7:10,69 --> 0:7:12,75
maybe a doctor or something.


152
0:7:12,75 --> 0:7:14,81
Not necessarily a
stolen moment.


153
0:7:14,81 --> 0:7:18,27
Something that is about
participation.


154
0:7:18,27 --> 0:7:20,63
Where the sitter has
to participate in


155
0:7:20,63 --> 0:7:21,5
the photo as well.


156
0:7:21,5 --> 0:7:23,77
You're not just taking
something from them.


157
0:7:23,77 --> 0:7:25,7
Kind of like this negotiation
or something.


158
0:7:25,7 --> 0:7:29,11



159
0:7:29,11 --> 0:7:30,45
You have to work with
the person.


160
0:7:30,45 --> 0:7:33,67



161
0:7:33,67 --> 0:7:35,41
Some of these are
my own projects,


162
0:7:35,41 --> 0:7:37,9
and then other stuff.


163
0:7:37,9 --> 0:7:40,99
The telenovelas series is
something that is definitely


164
0:7:40,99 --> 0:7:42,13
important to me.


165
0:7:42,13 --> 0:7:46,63
The telenovela project started
with "Colors." The idea of


166
0:7:46,63 --> 0:7:51,33
doing a whole issue on soap
operas in Mexico City came up.


167
0:7:51,33 --> 0:7:53,49
I thought they were interesting,
because so many


168
0:7:53,49 --> 0:7:56,59
people watched them, because
it's kind of like there's


169
0:7:56,59 --> 0:8:0,25
these unattainable dreams for
the people watching them.


170
0:8:0,25 --> 0:8:3,77
But there's all these social and
political things that are


171
0:8:3,77 --> 0:8:5,63
behind it and in it.


172
0:8:5,63 --> 0:8:8,77
You're dealing with things like
with money, with race,


173
0:8:8,77 --> 0:8:12,66
with these Cinderella stories.


174
0:8:12,66 --> 0:8:15,81
Part of it was also because half
my family's from Mexico.


175
0:8:15,81 --> 0:8:19,85
And my family came across
the border illegally.


176
0:8:19,85 --> 0:8:22,42
They were poor, trying to better
themselves, whatever.


177
0:8:22,42 --> 0:8:25,1
Trying to get this dream.


178
0:8:25,1 --> 0:8:28,39
It all kind of made sense
to me in that way.


179
0:8:28,39 --> 0:8:31,6
I've been shooting in Mexico a
lot of over the years, and


180
0:8:31,6 --> 0:8:33,87
tomorrow I'm going back
to shoot, but


181
0:8:33,87 --> 0:8:35,57
to start a new project.


182
0:8:35,57 --> 0:8:38,21
I'm going to Mexico tomorrow,
so I'm packing now.


183
0:8:38,21 --> 0:8:41,2
I'll probably throw my clothes
in with the tripod and stuff.


184
0:8:41,2 --> 0:8:43,39
I travel with this,
the lights.


185
0:8:43,39 --> 0:8:45,44
Some light stands here.


186
0:8:45,44 --> 0:8:46,87
This is the camera I use.


187
0:8:46,87 --> 0:8:48,65
It's a great camera.


188
0:8:48,65 --> 0:8:50,4
These are film holders.


189
0:8:50,4 --> 0:8:54,375
This film here goes in there.


190
0:8:54,375 --> 0:8:56,685
And that's kind of it.


191
0:8:56,685 --> 0:8:59,11
And all my spare
Mexican pesos.


192
0:8:59,11 --> 0:9:44,83



193
0:9:44,83 --> 0:9:45,17
OK.


194
0:9:45,17 --> 0:9:48,9
So we just got here
in Monterrey.


195
0:9:48,9 --> 0:9:52,97
I've been to a lot of places
in Mexico, but not here.


196
0:9:52,97 --> 0:9:56,9
We came to Monterrey, Mexico to
do a shoot on the fashion


197
0:9:56,9 --> 0:9:59,9
and hairstyle of these kids
who listen to a lot of


198
0:9:59,9 --> 0:10:3,13
vallenato and cumbia
from Columbia.


199
0:10:3,13 --> 0:10:4,99
They call themselves Colombians,
but they're not


200
0:10:4,99 --> 0:10:5,61
Colombians.


201
0:10:5,61 --> 0:10:8,95
They're from Mexico,
and particularly,


202
0:10:8,95 --> 0:10:9,91
they're from Monterrey.


203
0:10:9,91 --> 0:10:10,57
I don't know.


204
0:10:10,57 --> 0:10:17,87
They've been called
"Cholombians."


205
0:10:17,87 --> 0:10:21,67
With that like documentary-style
portrait,


206
0:10:21,67 --> 0:10:23,65
you're really dependent on
the people showing up.


207
0:10:23,65 --> 0:10:25,26
And a lot of times, they
don't show up.


208
0:10:25,26 --> 0:10:27,715
Because they don't know you,
and they don't really--


209
0:10:27,715 --> 0:10:30,79
I think you've got to bring
yourself to them.


210
0:10:30,79 --> 0:10:33,755
So first, we went to the market,
where they buy music,


211
0:10:33,755 --> 0:10:37,7
and they can buy videos,
shirts, hats, trinkets,


212
0:10:37,7 --> 0:10:40,37
Colombian things, Colombian
pictures.


213
0:10:40,37 --> 0:10:42,96
They buy this, and it's kind
of a gathering point.


214
0:10:42,96 --> 0:10:48,41
They sell a lot of bootleg
films, and there seems to be a


215
0:10:48,41 --> 0:10:51,9
little brothel behind where
we are shooting.


216
0:10:51,9 --> 0:10:56,59



217
0:10:56,59 --> 0:10:59,7
I didn't want to shoot them,
necessarily, with all the


218
0:10:59,7 --> 0:11:2,19
grime and stuff, like,
say, in the market.


219
0:11:2,19 --> 0:11:4,95
I wanted to keep the
image clean.


220
0:11:4,95 --> 0:11:6,75
Because they're interesting
enough on their own, and I


221
0:11:6,75 --> 0:11:9,22
think the background would
just distract.


222
0:11:9,22 --> 0:11:12,24
I wasn't trying to make some
kind of social statement about


223
0:11:12,24 --> 0:11:14,71
where they live, or about
anything like that.


224
0:11:14,71 --> 0:11:17,3
It's more about them
and their style.


225
0:11:17,3 --> 0:11:22,24



226
0:11:22,24 --> 0:11:24,21
I still shoot mostly
with the 4x5.


227
0:11:24,21 --> 0:11:25,6
Almost only.


228
0:11:25,6 --> 0:11:28,15
My camera is made in Germany.


229
0:11:28,15 --> 0:11:30,2
It's a Linhof.


230
0:11:30,2 --> 0:11:30,78
I'm like this dinosaur.


231
0:11:30,78 --> 0:11:35,7
I get hired on ad jobs to use
my 4x5, and then the art


232
0:11:35,7 --> 0:11:36,63
directors are like, wow,
I haven't seen one of


233
0:11:36,63 --> 0:11:38,1
those in a long time.


234
0:11:38,1 --> 0:11:39,4
They're really slow, though.


235
0:11:39,4 --> 0:11:40,91
Sometimes I hate my camera.


236
0:11:40,91 --> 0:11:43,45
But it's great at
the same time.


237
0:11:43,45 --> 0:11:47,39
I guess the thing was, I was
never really a 35 millimeter


238
0:11:47,39 --> 0:11:52,35
kind of war photographer style,
like run around, shoot.


239
0:11:52,35 --> 0:11:54,89
Snap, snap, snap.


240
0:11:54,89 --> 0:11:56,16
Different angles and stuff.


241
0:11:56,16 --> 0:11:59,6
Since I did do painting, and
since I was used to setting up


242
0:11:59,6 --> 0:12:2,29
compositions, I felt more
comfortable with that.


243
0:12:2,29 --> 0:12:5,19
Still trying to figure
out my framing here.


244
0:12:5,19 --> 0:12:8,4
I've never really been into the
idea of trying to convince


245
0:12:8,4 --> 0:12:10,66
someone to do a photo by
giving them money.


246
0:12:10,66 --> 0:12:12,89
I think it creates kind
of a weird dynamic.


247
0:12:12,89 --> 0:12:16,69
So my way around that, a lot
of times, has been to just


248
0:12:16,69 --> 0:12:18,6
shoot Polaroids, and give
them Polaroids.


249
0:12:18,6 --> 0:12:24,55



250
0:12:24,55 --> 0:12:27,9
So I'm giving him the one
he likes the most.


251
0:12:27,9 --> 0:12:30,94
And keep a few for myself, so I
can work out what I'm doing.


252
0:12:30,94 --> 0:12:33,23
I can critique how this
shoot's going.


253
0:12:33,23 --> 0:12:38,59



254
0:12:38,59 --> 0:12:40,8
I will also show them
what I'm doing.


255
0:12:40,8 --> 0:12:43,9
I think it builds a sense of
trust, if they look at the


256
0:12:43,9 --> 0:12:45,78
Polaroid and they see
what I'm doing.


257
0:12:45,78 --> 0:12:47,25
They show it to their friends.


258
0:12:47,25 --> 0:12:51,34
Their friends get interested,
their friends want pictures.


259
0:12:51,34 --> 0:12:55,31
We just got our first shot,
about five or six guys.


260
0:12:55,31 --> 0:12:59,77
Tonight we're going to a party,
and if all goes well,


261
0:12:59,77 --> 0:13:1,35
we'll be working pretty
fast, and we'll


262
0:13:1,35 --> 0:13:2,6
get quite a bit done.


263
0:13:2,6 --> 0:13:7,36



264
0:13:7,36 --> 0:13:10,46
Obviously, people are hearing a
lot about Mexico these days


265
0:13:10,46 --> 0:13:12,17
for violence and drugs.


266
0:13:12,17 --> 0:13:15,6
I've been coming here fairly
often, and I've never really


267
0:13:15,6 --> 0:13:17,26
had bad experiences so far.


268
0:13:17,26 --> 0:13:20,42
But you can tell that there's
some tension here.


269
0:13:20,42 --> 0:13:23,18
We knew of some concerts, and we
were going to try to shoot


270
0:13:23,18 --> 0:13:26,54
in these clubs, but when we
asked for permission, the


271
0:13:26,54 --> 0:13:31,14
owner said no, because a lot
of gangsters or narcos hang


272
0:13:31,14 --> 0:13:31,915
out in these places.


273
0:13:31,915 --> 0:13:33,96
They said it's quite
dangerous for us.


274
0:13:33,96 --> 0:13:36,84
That at least we'd get beat
up, if not worse.


275
0:13:36,84 --> 0:13:39,55
And they also said that the kids
probably stay away from


276
0:13:39,55 --> 0:13:40,75
there more now.


277
0:13:40,75 --> 0:13:43,34
So we went out to the suburbs.


278
0:13:43,34 --> 0:13:45,5
We went to a club called
Lone Star.


279
0:13:45,5 --> 0:13:49,6
And basically, that had tons
of these kids there.


280
0:13:49,6 --> 0:13:50,61
They are quite young.


281
0:13:50,61 --> 0:13:53,25
They seem to be all
mostly teenagers.


282
0:13:53,25 --> 0:13:56,645
And basically, they dance
around in circles.


283
0:13:56,645 --> 0:14:0,5
It all seems pretty
mellow, actually.


284
0:14:0,5 --> 0:14:3,63
PATRICK: The way Stefan shoots
is we always do kind of a


285
0:14:3,63 --> 0:14:5,82
portable photo studio.


286
0:14:5,82 --> 0:14:7,63
We try to find a
wall, usually.


287
0:14:7,63 --> 0:14:10,7
But this one has too
much texture to it.


288
0:14:10,7 --> 0:14:12,71
So we want to keep it simple.


289
0:14:12,71 --> 0:14:17,15
STEFAN RUIZ: I've shot a lot of
times outside clubs, or all


290
0:14:17,15 --> 0:14:17,69
over the place.


291
0:14:17,69 --> 0:14:19,36
I'm quite used to doing this.


292
0:14:19,36 --> 0:14:20,61
I like doing it.


293
0:14:20,61 --> 0:14:27,24



294
0:14:27,24 --> 0:14:29,45
I'll often let the person
pose themselves.


295
0:14:29,45 --> 0:14:33,8
I'll compose it the way I like,
but I often want them to


296
0:14:33,8 --> 0:14:34,96
present themselves.


297
0:14:34,96 --> 0:14:39,51
Whether it is a refugee, or
someone who's insane, or some


298
0:14:39,51 --> 0:14:40,76
politician.


299
0:14:40,76 --> 0:14:42,71



300
0:14:42,71 --> 0:14:46,51
When I was, I think, 16, my
parents got divorced.


301
0:14:46,51 --> 0:14:48,255
And my dad was a lawyer.


302
0:14:48,255 --> 0:14:50,32
My mom was an art teacher.


303
0:14:50,32 --> 0:14:52,55
She wanted to go to Italy,
because her family was from


304
0:14:52,55 --> 0:14:54,19
Italy, and she wanted
to go there.


305
0:14:54,19 --> 0:14:58,29
And we went and lived
in Florence.


306
0:14:58,29 --> 0:15:1,88
At that point, I totally
didn't like Renaissance


307
0:15:1,88 --> 0:15:3,4
painting or anything.


308
0:15:3,4 --> 0:15:5,74
I finally got into a school,
like a high school.


309
0:15:5,74 --> 0:15:7,3
An art high school.


310
0:15:7,3 --> 0:15:9,14
And so I had to copy all
these famous paintings.


311
0:15:9,14 --> 0:15:11,84
I had to copy famous
sculptures.


312
0:15:11,84 --> 0:15:14,96
And by the end of year, I
actually started getting quite


313
0:15:14,96 --> 0:15:15,92
into Renaissance art.


314
0:15:15,92 --> 0:15:18,81
I especially like the older
portraits and stuff.


315
0:15:18,81 --> 0:15:21,8
And I like Flemish painting
a lot, too.


316
0:15:21,8 --> 0:15:23,45
I would say that's a huge
influence in my portraiture.


317
0:15:23,45 --> 0:15:34,1



318
0:15:34,1 --> 0:15:36,74
So we got quite a few
people that night.


319
0:15:36,74 --> 0:15:37,84
Maybe 20?


320
0:15:37,84 --> 0:15:38,13
I don't know.


321
0:15:38,13 --> 0:15:43,62
We stayed there until about
3:00 in the morning.


322
0:15:43,62 --> 0:15:47,3
Yesterday, we photographed
downtown.


323
0:15:47,3 --> 0:15:51,5
There's a 7-Eleven that's
below a radio station.


324
0:15:51,5 --> 0:15:53,65
All of the Cholombianos,
they hang out there.


325
0:15:53,65 --> 0:16:7,51



326
0:16:7,51 --> 0:16:8,13
We went there.


327
0:16:8,13 --> 0:16:10,97
We just picked some of
the guys, asked them.


328
0:16:10,97 --> 0:16:14,77
And if they're into it, then
we set up a little studio


329
0:16:14,77 --> 0:16:15,7
around the block.


330
0:16:15,7 --> 0:16:16,91
And yeah.


331
0:16:16,91 --> 0:16:18,266
I think we got a lot
of good things.


332
0:16:18,266 --> 0:16:20,85



333
0:16:20,85 --> 0:16:24,21
At the end of the day, I think
that work should work on a lot


334
0:16:24,21 --> 0:16:24,9
of different levels.


335
0:16:24,9 --> 0:16:26,32
It should be interesting
to look at.


336
0:16:26,32 --> 0:16:28,35
It should be technically
well-done.


337
0:16:28,35 --> 0:16:32,5
The subject itself, hopefully
it's got a political thing.


338
0:16:32,5 --> 0:16:34,8
Maybe the photo makes you
think about something.


339
0:16:34,8 --> 0:16:36,86
Maybe it's not just eye candy.


340
0:16:36,86 --> 0:16:41,49
It's not just a one
idea thing.


341
0:16:41,49 --> 0:16:42,4
All right.


342
0:16:42,4 --> 0:16:44,29
I think we're done.


343
0:16:44,29 --> 0:16:46,7
I think I'm going to be really
happy with this shoot.


344
0:16:46,7 --> 0:16:48,34
I think these guys are
pretty genius.


345
0:16:48,34 --> 0:16:57,29
And just by taking time to
document their style, I think


346
0:16:57,29 --> 0:16:58,54
I'll be really happy with it.


347
0:16:58,54 --> 0:18:58,54
