###11 SHANE SMITH: This is a shrine to Jesus Malverde, who's the
###15 patron saint of drug smugglers, narcos.
###18 So we're going to light a candle.
###21 This is freaking me out because I'm very
###23 superstitious.
###26 That's him there.
###26 Patron saint of the drug dealers.
###28 They all come in here.
###30 They say a prayer.
###31 They write a prayer on here and they say, please let me
###34 get across the border with my drugs.
###38 Literally, religion about drug dealers.
###41 
###46 Now the whole time I was hanging out with the LeBarons,
###48 I found myself wondering, how do you actually protect
###50 yourself against narco lords who employ whole armies of
###54 assassins whose sole job is to kill their rivals.
###58 Well, the LeBarons started by adopting military-style
###61 tactics and setting up checkpoints, roadblocks, and
###64 watch towers.
###65 BRENT LEBARON: We hit a real big low, you know, when they
###67 killed Benjamin.
###68 It was a real big blow to our entire community.
###71 SHANE SMITH: Right.
###71 BRENT LEBARON: I was really close to Benjamin.
###76 Knew him really well.
###77 SHANE SMITH: After Benjamin was killed, you set up your
###80 own community watch, your own night watch.
###82 And then you built this up and you have people
###84 watching every night.
###86 BRENT LEBARON: Every night.
###87 SHANE SMITH: What are you watching for?
###88 BRENT LEBARON: Pretty much suspicious vehicles.
###92 We pretty much know everybody, and so if it looks like a
###95 vehicle I've never seen before, then
###97 it was getting checked.
###98 SHANE SMITH: This watch hut looks down on one of the main
###101 drug trafficking roads.
###102 BRENT LEBARON: One of them, yeah.
###103 SHANE SMITH: The only people here with
###105 weapons are the criminals.
###107 BRENT LEBARON: Pretty much.
###108 SHANE SMITH: The drug cartels.
###109 BRENT LEBARON: Rumor got out that we had high-powered
###111 rifles and snipers and whatnot.
###113 SHANE SMITH: And 50 cals up here and stuff.
###115 BRENT LEBARON: Well you know how rumors can spread.
###118 Which was a benefit for us.
###120 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, it's good.
###120 It's a good rumor.
###120 BRENT LEBARON: It was a really good rumor for us.
###123 I believe that the watch tower is one of the key points to
###127 keeping the bad guys away from our town.
###129 Also the Feds and the military are in our town.
###133 This is their base.
###134 We actually had a roadblock, to where there was one way in
###137 and one way out.
###139 SHANE SMITH: So you have barricades, checkpoints, and
###141 watch towers.
###142 BRENT LEBARON: Yeah.
###143 I would say our valley right here is quite a bit safer than
###146 a lot of areas.
###148 SHANE SMITH: Casas Grandes, which is about 30 minutes
###150 away, they're still having kidnappings and stuff there.
###153 BRENT LEBARON: Here and there.
###154 Before it was literally two, three a week.
###158 SHANE SMITH: Wow.
###159 It's a lot.
###160 BRENT LEBARON: That's a lot, yeah.
###161 We were never pinpointing drug cartels or anything else.
###164 But when it came to them now kidnapping our family members,
###168 that's what we took a stand against.
###170 When it comes to protecting our family, if we have to die
###173 doing it, we're going to.
###176 SHANE SMITH: So the LeBarons made their colony into a
###178 little fortress, using the same counterterrorist
###180 techniques that the US Army uses in Iraq and Afghanistan.
###184 And because of it, the killings and the kidnappings
###186 in the Mormon areas actually died down.
###189 But road blocks and security checkpoints are only going to
###192 get you so far.
###193 At some point, if you're fighting the narcos, you're
###195 going to need guns.
###197 If Benjamin was taken by a bunch of guys with weapons--
###200 they were unarmed--
###202 how are you supposed to defend yourself?
###204 CAR DRIVER: Well, there's really no law in Mexico that
###206 gives you the right to bear arms.
###209 Legally, the quickest and the best way is
###212 through a gun club.
###214 SHANE SMITH: Now in Mexico it's nearly
###215 impossible to own a gun.
###217 In fact, one of the only legal ways to do so is to go through
###220 the extremely difficult process of starting a gun club
###223 or a shooting range.
###225 
###231 Why don't you have your own shooting
###232 club in Colonia LeBaron?
###234 CAR DRIVER: Our ex-mayor wouldn't sign
###236 the papers we needed.
###237 We had all the first members on a list.
###241 Well, he turns around and it shows it
###243 to our bad-boy buddies.
###245 SHANE SMITH: You're trying to arm yourselves, and he's
###247 working for the cartel.
###248 So you can't arm yourselves.
###250 CAR DRIVER: Exactly.
###250 Pretty much.
###250 SHANE SMITH: Where is he now?
###251 CAR DRIVER: He's in prison.
###253 
###257 SHANE SMITH: There's 15 million illegal assault rifles
###260 estimated in Mexico.
###261 I mean, the thing is, if you have 20 guys
###263 with assault rifles--
###264 
###266 I think I'm going to go for one of those turkeys.
###270 Oh yeah, I'm going to get one of them.
###274 So the LeBarons finally decided that if it continued
###277 to be illegal to own weapons, which meant criminals were the
###280 only ones that had guns, that it was time to change the law.
###283 
###290 Alex LeBaron, who is now a Congressman, is determined to
###293 protect his colony from the cartels, no
###295 matter what it takes.
###297 Even if it means a shoot out with the Mexican military.
###300 ALEX LEBARON: They went into our farm.
###302 We thought they were criminals.
###303 We shot one of them.
###304 It was a very sad incident, but it gained a lot
###306 of respect for us.
###307 SHANE SMITH: You outshot the military.
###308 ALEX LEBARON: We outshot the military.
###309 We got phone calls from heads of the criminal organizations
###313 after that incident.
###314 And they told us they were proud of us to some degree.
###317 People in drug organizations--
###319 and including in the same military-- know that we have
###321 weapons, because we've been saying it.
###323 SHANE SMITH: Sure.
###323 ALEX LEBARON: We have illegal weapons in our community.
###325 Come in and find them if you want.
###326 We buy them in the States.
###327 We know we traffic them illegally.
###329 But that's the only way to defend
###330 yourself in this country.
###332 In order to get access to a weapon in our country it would
###335 cost you up to $10,000, and that wouldn't even be through
###337 a legal way.
###338 SHANE SMITH: So the majority of the weapons being used by
###340 the narcos--
###341 ALEX LEBARON: Yes.
###341 SHANE SMITH: --are coming from America.
###342 ALEX LEBARON: Absolutely.
###343 SHANE SMITH: And the money is coming from America.
###345 BRENT LEBARON: Absolutely.
###345 I think the Americans need to really understand that any
###348 policies that are implemented in the United States impact
###351 our country.
###352 
###354 SHANE SMITH: So the money for all these guns
###356 is coming from America.
###357 The guns themselves come from America.
###360 The coke is being sold in America, but the war is being
###364 fought in Mexico.
###365 And considering 1,300 people were killed in the region just
###369 this past August alone, in northern Mexico self defense
###372 has truly become a matter of life and death.
###375 
###380 One of the things that we were worried about was people
###382 knowing that we were here.
###386 They've just announced to the whole town that we're here
###389 shooting, in a town where they used to have three or four
###392 kidnappings a week.
###393 I'm going to get drunk.
###394
