- Turk, that was amazing!
- Woman, shush.


6
0:0:17,127 --> 0:0:27,247
lt's a lot cooler
if we don't make a big deal out of it.

0:0:27,247 --> 0:0:33,527
Hang on, Ma. lt's him.

Shall we? And...


12
0:0:51,647 --> 0:0:54,327
My God!
Which one of you two did that?


13
0:0:54,327 --> 0:0:55,887
- My bad.
- That was me.


14
0:0:55,887 --> 0:0:58,847
- Both of you?
- Player!


15
0:0:58,847 --> 0:1:3,767
Could we have an agreement?
No enclosed spaces.


16
0:1:3,767 --> 0:1:7,247
- Morning, doctors.
- Morning, sir.


17
0:1:7,247 --> 0:1:13,47
Mrs Winston,
it's back to the home for you.


18
0:1:13,47 --> 0:1:16,687
- Elliot, that is disgusting.
- Seriously.


19
0:1:16,687 --> 0:1:22,47
Sweetheart, consider a change in diet.


20
0:1:22,47 --> 0:1:24,887
Fine. l hate you guys.
l hate you, l hate you.

23
0:1:32,247 --> 0:1:34,287
My man!


24
0:1:34,287 --> 0:1:36,207
Who the hell's Jerome?

0:1:40,247 --> 0:1:41,287

<i>Today we get</i>

Welcome to Hell.

0:2:7,967 --> 0:2:11,567
Gimme some hungry chicken.


34
0:2:11,567 --> 0:2:13,767
Not hungry enough.
Give me some more.


35
0:2:13,767 --> 0:2:34,7
There you go.


36
0:2:34,7 --> 0:2:36,167
Look how scared they are.


37
0:2:36,167 --> 0:2:46,367
lt's like we're cheetahs
and they're a pack of gazelles.


38
0:2:46,367 --> 0:2:50,527
l'm Dr Bob Kelso,
and l'm your Chief of Medicine.


39
0:2:50,527 --> 0:2:54,887
l want to encourage you all
to think of me as your safety net.


40
0:2:54,887 --> 0:2:58,687
Because l promise you,
we're a family here.


41
0:2:58,687 --> 0:3:2,967
Let's go get 'em, doctors.


42
0:3:2,967 --> 0:3:4,407
They're buying it.


43
0:3:4,407 --> 0:3:7,887
''The Devil's greatest trick was
convincing the world he didn't exist.''

- You two are dorks.
- l gotta go.


47
0:3:13,607 --> 0:3:16,647
l gotta go meet up with
my med student up in Surgery.


48
0:3:16,647 --> 0:3:18,47
Know who you're getting?


49
0:3:18,47 --> 0:3:21,127
Nope, but it's probably someone black.


50
0:3:21,127 --> 0:3:23,727
- <i>Sugar darlin'</i>
- <i>Girl</i>


51
0:3:23,727 --> 0:3:27,127
So, l want someone
l can be friends with, you know?


52
0:3:27,127 --> 0:3:31,207
l hope l get a jerk. l took
so much crap as a med student


53
0:3:31,207 --> 0:3:35,647
that l've been waiting for the day
l get to make someone suffer.


54
0:3:35,647 --> 0:3:37,287
Listen, nurse.


55
0:3:37,287 --> 0:3:39,287
l'm looking for a Dr Elliot Reid.


56
0:3:39,287 --> 0:3:41,207
l'm Elliot Reid.


57
0:3:41,207 --> 0:3:44,847
Guy's name,
guy's job, guy's clothes...


58
0:3:44,847 --> 0:3:47,127
Anything else you wanna tell me?


59
0:3:47,127 --> 0:3:52,647
Goody! You're a jerk.


60
0:3:52,647 --> 0:3:56,807
Just remember to breathe,
and you'll get through the day.


61
0:3:56,807 --> 0:4:0,887
Josh?
Hi, l'm Dr Dorian.


62
0:4:0,887 --> 0:4:2,967
l know what this looks like, but...


63
0:4:2,967 --> 0:4:5,247
l do that all the time.


64
0:4:5,247 --> 0:4:8,7
Do you ever part
your hair on the wrong side


65
0:4:8,7 --> 0:4:11,167
to see what you look like
to other people?


66
0:4:11,167 --> 0:4:12,447
No.


67
0:4:12,447 --> 0:4:15,647
lt totally messes everyone up.


68
0:4:15,647 --> 0:4:17,887
Do you have any questions?


69
0:4:17,887 --> 0:4:20,87
What's the babe
situation like here?


70
0:4:20,87 --> 0:4:27,207
Easy, tiger.


71
0:4:27,207 --> 0:4:29,247
Have you seen a med student here?


72
0:4:29,247 --> 0:4:31,647
Yeah. Me.


73
0:4:31,647 --> 0:4:34,807
Cool. Nice to meet you, ma'am.


74
0:4:34,807 --> 0:4:38,287
Actually, the only people
that call me ''ma'am'' are nobody.


75
0:4:38,287 --> 0:4:40,967
No. l use ''ma'am'' all the time. Watch.


76
0:4:40,967 --> 0:4:43,647
What up, ma'am?


77
0:4:43,647 --> 0:4:47,287
- See? lt's my thing.
- Yeah, right.


78
0:4:47,287 --> 0:4:49,47
Come on. l'm here to learn.


79
0:4:49,47 --> 0:4:51,87
Listen up, kid.
Lesson number one:


80
0:4:51,87 --> 0:4:53,247
All surgical interns?
They're dogs.


81
0:4:53,247 --> 0:4:55,127
- Not a problem.
- Hey, baby.


82
0:4:55,127 --> 0:5:0,87
This overbearing machismo is usually
just compensation for a lap-pinkie.


83
0:5:0,87 --> 0:5:3,807
That's cold!


84
0:5:3,807 --> 0:5:5,887
What just happened?


85
0:5:5,887 --> 0:5:10,647
Don't worry about it.
lt's all good in the 'hood.


86
0:5:10,647 --> 0:5:15,527
l'll tell you what l expect.
You parted your hair on the other side?


87
0:5:15,527 --> 0:5:18,807
You're gonna do H & Ps,
write admission orders...


88
0:5:18,807 --> 0:5:20,367
What are you doing?


89
0:5:20,367 --> 0:5:22,847
l can't walk and write at the same time.


90
0:5:22,847 --> 0:5:25,847
- lt makes me nauseous.
- <i>A famous doctor once said</i>


91
0:5:25,847 --> 0:5:29,727
<i>''Show me a med student that only</i>
<i>triples my work and I'll kiss his feet, ''</i>


92
0:5:29,727 --> 0:5:34,287
Philip, l need you to shave his groin
so l can place a femoral triple-lumen.


93
0:5:34,287 --> 0:5:38,87
l'm not so much with
the ''shavin' a guy's curlies''.


94
0:5:38,87 --> 0:5:41,167
lf you get just one
bad evaluation from me,


95
0:5:41,167 --> 0:5:44,87
it'll torch your class rank,
so do what l tell you.


96
0:5:44,87 --> 0:5:46,127
And if l ask you to shave a groin,


97
0:5:46,127 --> 0:5:53,927
thank your lucky stars
that l said ''shave''.


98
0:5:53,927 --> 0:5:55,447
l'll tell you what.


99
0:5:55,447 --> 0:5:59,487
l'll lather you up,
and you think about baseball.


100
0:5:59,487 --> 0:6:3,7
Natural redhead.


101
0:6:3,7 --> 0:6:6,487
l'll need you to change the dressing
on the fem bypass in 402,


102
0:6:6,487 --> 0:6:9,407
and DC the staples
on the gastroplasty in post-op.


103
0:6:9,407 --> 0:6:13,167
l have no idea what you just said.


104
0:6:13,167 --> 0:6:15,887
l'm kidding.


105
0:6:15,887 --> 0:6:21,7
Looks like you won
the med student raffle there, pal.


106
0:6:21,7 --> 0:6:23,607
- lntroduce me.
- Excuse me?


107
0:6:23,607 --> 0:6:26,727
You give me her name
and tell her my name,


108
0:6:26,727 --> 0:6:29,327
or you go her name,
my name, my name, her name.


109
0:6:29,327 --> 0:6:32,127
No. You like Carla.


110
0:6:32,127 --> 0:6:35,7
Do you actually listen
to yourself when you speak,


111
0:6:35,7 --> 0:6:38,247
or do you find you drift in and out?


112
0:6:38,247 --> 0:6:41,247
Fine. Then l'm gonna go ahead


113
0:6:41,247 --> 0:6:44,847
and continue to focus
all my energies on Carla.


114
0:6:44,847 --> 0:6:47,847
Listening, watching...


115
0:6:47,847 --> 0:6:50,287
...waiting.


116
0:6:50,287 --> 0:6:55,407
Dr Cox, Kristen.
Kristen, Dr Cox.


117
0:6:55,407 --> 0:6:59,807
Josh, l asked you
to get this guy's history an hour ago.


118
0:6:59,807 --> 0:7:2,87
lt should've taken five minutes.


119
0:7:2,87 --> 0:7:6,447
We were just talking.
This guy, he is the bomb!


120
0:7:6,447 --> 0:7:8,567
OK. Bye-bye. Moving on.


121
0:7:8,567 --> 0:7:11,287
Help someone else. l'm sorry about that.


122
0:7:11,287 --> 0:7:13,367
Relax, Bambi. Be nice to Thumper.


123
0:7:13,367 --> 0:7:15,807
He wrote ''The guy sweats
when he exercises.''


124
0:7:15,807 --> 0:7:17,647
- l do.
- l'll call Ripley's!


125
0:7:17,647 --> 0:7:21,527
Relax. lt's just one mistake.


126
0:7:21,527 --> 0:7:22,967
Relax, Bambi.


127
0:7:22,967 --> 0:7:25,167
lt's just one mistake.


128
0:7:25,167 --> 0:7:29,647
- Good night, Thumper.
- Cool! Great first day, Dr Dorian.


129
0:7:29,647 --> 0:7:33,47
Yeah, it was.


130
0:7:33,47 --> 0:7:36,807
- Relax. lt's just one mistake.
- Yes! They're each one mistake.


131
0:7:36,807 --> 0:7:39,647
Put 'em all together,
it makes four million.


132
0:7:39,647 --> 0:7:43,367
Did you just snap at me?
Because l think he just snapped at me.


133
0:7:43,367 --> 0:7:45,447
- l'm sorry.
- Yeah, you are.


134
0:7:45,447 --> 0:7:47,487
Carla, l gotta go home.


135
0:7:47,487 --> 0:7:50,87
You have to co-sign all these orders,


136
0:7:50,87 --> 0:7:54,207
fill out a vascular consult on bed three
and get a tox screen for Mrs O'Brien.


137
0:7:54,207 --> 0:8:16,207
- But Josh did all this.
- Honey, l don't think so.


138
0:8:16,207 --> 0:8:20,447
Mrs O'Brien, l'm afraid
l'm gonna need a urine sample.


139
0:8:20,447 --> 0:8:23,567
l hope you're taking
very good care of my hospital.


140
0:8:23,567 --> 0:8:26,887
You're darn tootin'.


141
0:8:26,887 --> 0:8:30,967
Jackass. Dr Reid, say hello
to Whitaker Chambers.


142
0:8:30,967 --> 0:8:33,767
- What up?
- ''What up''?


143
0:8:33,767 --> 0:8:36,47
Whitaker Chambers is the CEO


144
0:8:36,47 --> 0:8:38,727
of the corporation
that owns this hospital,


145
0:8:38,727 --> 0:8:42,687
so l suggest you stop
acting like LL Cool Reid


146
0:8:42,687 --> 0:8:45,447
and start acting like Dr Reid.


147
0:8:45,447 --> 0:8:46,967
You dig?


148
0:8:46,967 --> 0:8:49,967
- Why would he want to meet me?
- Hey, Dad.


149
0:8:49,967 --> 0:8:52,847
Hey, son!


150
0:8:52,847 --> 0:8:55,767
Poopies.


151
0:8:55,767 --> 0:9:2,207
- lt was really nice to meet you.
- Same here, doctor.


152
0:9:2,207 --> 0:9:4,327
l'm sorry. Dr Cox,


153
0:9:4,327 --> 0:9:7,367
l was gonna take Kristen
out for a beer after work.


154
0:9:7,367 --> 0:9:11,167
Would you like to join us?


155
0:9:11,167 --> 0:9:14,367
No. l can't do it.


156
0:9:14,367 --> 0:9:16,447
No!


157
0:9:16,447 --> 0:9:21,367
- ls he OK?
- Not really.


158
0:9:21,367 --> 0:9:26,807
Dr Dorian?


159
0:9:26,807 --> 0:9:30,287
Your roommate let me in.


160
0:9:30,287 --> 0:9:32,447
Cool dead dog. Can l pet him?


161
0:9:32,447 --> 0:9:33,687
<i>Is he kidding?</i>


162
0:9:33,687 --> 0:9:37,207
l came by because l know
l didn't do so great yesterday...


163
0:9:37,207 --> 0:9:39,647
What is it that tipped you off?


164
0:9:39,647 --> 0:9:43,367
Was it your inability to
perform even the simplest task?


165
0:9:43,367 --> 0:9:46,47
l'll bet it was that
l got home 20 minutes ago


166
0:9:46,47 --> 0:9:49,727
because l spent the entire night
cleaning up after you.


167
0:9:49,727 --> 0:9:54,207
l'm sorry.
l was just really scared.


168
0:9:54,207 --> 0:9:57,367
You know what, Josh?
You should be scared.


169
0:9:57,367 --> 0:10:0,87
Because l gotta be honest with you.


170
0:10:0,87 --> 0:10:2,967
l don't think you got what it takes.


171
0:10:2,967 --> 0:10:8,727
Do you?


172
0:10:8,727 --> 0:10:14,167
l didn't think so.


173
0:10:14,167 --> 0:10:19,687
l'm still not gonna feel bad
about what l said to Josh.


174
0:10:19,687 --> 0:10:23,727
You don't scare me, woman.


175
0:10:23,727 --> 0:10:26,407
l'm so sorry. l'll apologise at rounds.


176
0:10:26,407 --> 0:10:28,887
Nurse Roberts, have you seen Josh?


177
0:10:28,887 --> 0:10:31,727
The tall skinny one? He quit.


178
0:10:31,727 --> 0:10:33,967
Nice job, Bambi.


179
0:10:33,967 --> 0:10:37,247
l didn't mean for that to happen.
l didn't.


180
0:10:37,247 --> 0:10:39,767
You don't have to apologise to me.


181
0:10:39,767 --> 0:10:50,607
You will have to answer to Jesus.


182
0:10:50,607 --> 0:10:53,887
<i>After what happened</i>
<i>I did what any good person would do,</i>


183
0:10:53,887 --> 0:10:57,487
<i>I went looking for confirmation</i>
<i>that it wasn't my fault,</i>


184
0:10:57,487 --> 0:10:59,367
Here's what happened.


185
0:10:59,367 --> 0:11:1,527
He was screwing up constantly.


186
0:11:1,527 --> 0:11:3,967
l didn't force him to quit.


187
0:11:3,967 --> 0:11:6,687
l don't think it's my fault he quit.


188
0:11:6,687 --> 0:11:9,767
Most of the bad things
that happen here are your fault.


189
0:11:9,767 --> 0:11:12,687
- l was talking to her.
- l won't say what you wanna hear.


190
0:11:12,687 --> 0:11:16,47
Nurse Roberts says he's the most
incompetent doctor she's worked with.


191
0:11:16,47 --> 0:11:19,407
Laverne, what'd you say about JD
when he first started working here?


192
0:11:19,407 --> 0:11:22,407
He was the most incompetent
doctor l ever worked with.


193
0:11:22,407 --> 0:11:24,767
- lt's not my fault he failed.
- You failed.


194
0:11:24,767 --> 0:11:29,247
You're supposed to be his teacher.


195
0:11:29,247 --> 0:11:33,47
See, to me that sounds like
it's your fault. l don't know.


196
0:11:33,47 --> 0:11:35,47
Shocker. Yeah.


197
0:11:35,47 --> 0:11:45,367
Where you going? Stay and play!


198
0:11:45,367 --> 0:11:49,287
So you're having trouble
asking out Kristen.


199
0:11:49,287 --> 0:11:51,447
- No problem.
- Whoa, Curly.


200
0:11:51,447 --> 0:11:53,927
l got no problem. Wanna have a drink?


201
0:11:53,927 --> 0:11:55,727
- No.
- See? l'm fine.


202
0:11:55,727 --> 0:11:59,127
You know how men are always
talking about themselves?


203
0:11:59,127 --> 0:12:1,487
Women like to talk
about themselves more.


204
0:12:1,487 --> 0:12:3,927
Thank you.
You've touched me deeply.


205
0:12:3,927 --> 0:12:6,327
You can be cynical,
but l'm telling you,


206
0:12:6,327 --> 0:12:10,447
get Kristen to talk about herself,
it's on. lt's on and poppin'.


207
0:12:10,447 --> 0:12:15,967
- lf that doesn't work, do what l do.
- Which is what?


208
0:12:15,967 --> 0:12:20,327
- Show her the booty!
- No. You put that away.


209
0:12:20,327 --> 0:12:22,87
Think of the children.


210
0:12:22,87 --> 0:12:24,487
Doctor!


211
0:12:24,487 --> 0:12:29,167
Philip, l was wondering if you could
write out this discharge summary.


212
0:12:29,167 --> 0:12:30,927
Where's the fun?


213
0:12:30,927 --> 0:12:32,647
- Excuse me?
- From now on,


214
0:12:32,647 --> 0:12:35,7
when you're wondering whether
l'll do something,


215
0:12:35,7 --> 0:12:37,327
ask yourself, ''Where's the fun?''


216
0:12:37,327 --> 0:12:39,727
lt'll be a timesaver for both of us.


217
0:12:39,727 --> 0:12:43,327
l'm betting that
if you were really honest with yourself,


218
0:12:43,327 --> 0:12:48,687
you'd realise how unsatisfying it is
to ride on your father's coattails.


219
0:12:48,687 --> 0:12:55,887
No, l'm OK with it.


220
0:12:55,887 --> 0:12:59,47
Josh, this is completely crazy.


221
0:12:59,47 --> 0:13:1,247
You told me l shouldn't be a doctor.


222
0:13:1,247 --> 0:13:3,847
Kidding... Josh.


223
0:13:3,847 --> 0:13:8,327
You know what? Forget all of that.
You have to hang in there.


224
0:13:8,327 --> 0:13:11,207
Now, l promise you,
l am gonna help you.


225
0:13:11,207 --> 0:13:14,527
Here we go.


226
0:13:14,527 --> 0:13:17,447
You're doing it.


227
0:13:17,447 --> 0:13:20,447
Yeah, you are!
You're doing it!


228
0:13:20,447 --> 0:13:24,447
- So, what do you say?
- l know what you're trying to do.


229
0:13:24,447 --> 0:13:27,167
My whole life,
people have felt sorry for me.


230
0:13:27,167 --> 0:13:30,607
- Why would anyone feel sorry for you?
- l'm clumsy,


231
0:13:30,607 --> 0:13:33,367
l'm always throwing up,
l don't even have an ass!


232
0:13:33,367 --> 0:13:37,167
Those are the same things l was
dealing with when l started here.


233
0:13:37,167 --> 0:13:40,367
Except for the ass part.
l actually have a great ass.


234
0:13:40,367 --> 0:13:42,727
lt's firm like mutton.


235
0:13:42,727 --> 0:13:45,727
l'm not buying it, Dr Dorian.


236
0:13:45,727 --> 0:13:50,47
But thanks for trying.


237
0:13:50,47 --> 0:13:52,687
- So, where you from?
- Chicago. You?


238
0:13:52,687 --> 0:13:56,447
- Pittsburgh. Family? Brothers, sisters?
- One older brother. You?


239
0:13:56,447 --> 0:14:1,127
We're gonna keep the focus on you.
Are your parents still together?


240
0:14:1,127 --> 0:14:2,647
Yep.


241
0:14:2,647 --> 0:14:5,687
Do you have any idea how hard
you're making this on me?


242
0:14:5,687 --> 0:14:8,607
No, but l wonder if someone
slipped something into my soda.


243
0:14:8,607 --> 0:14:12,967
He has that effect on everyone
the first few weeks.


244
0:14:12,967 --> 0:14:16,127
l gotta go. We'll pick this up later.


245
0:14:16,127 --> 0:14:21,407
Pick what up?


246
0:14:21,407 --> 0:14:23,7
What up, dawg?


247
0:14:23,7 --> 0:14:32,727
Not a strong move
with the tighty-whities.


248
0:14:32,727 --> 0:14:35,807
lf you won't help,
go wait for your trust fund to mature.


249
0:14:35,807 --> 0:14:40,87
- Dr Reid, can l see you a minute?
- Dr Kelso, l am so, so sorry.


250
0:14:40,87 --> 0:14:43,407
l just got so frustrated,
plus l'm PMSing.


251
0:14:43,407 --> 0:14:46,807
Well, the pill plays havoc
with my cycle. l'm like...


252
0:14:46,807 --> 0:14:48,167
Dr Reid?


253
0:14:48,167 --> 0:14:50,287
You talk too much. lt's a problem.


254
0:14:50,287 --> 0:14:52,687
Why are you doing
your med student's work?


255
0:14:52,687 --> 0:14:55,767
- Well, his father...
- l hate his father.


256
0:14:55,767 --> 0:14:58,807
But l'm the one who has
to suck up to him, not you.


257
0:14:58,807 --> 0:15:7,847
For God's sake, woman,
show some <i>cojones!</i>


258
0:15:7,847 --> 0:15:11,287
<i>It's hard trying to figure out</i>
<i>how to reach somebody,</i>


259
0:15:11,287 --> 0:15:13,967
<i>The thing is to think</i>
<i>of someone I look up to</i>


260
0:15:13,967 --> 0:15:16,247
<i>and remember</i>
<i>how they got through to me,</i>


261
0:15:16,247 --> 0:15:18,727
The only way you could
be less productive


262
0:15:18,727 --> 0:15:21,407
is if you were the wall
on which you're leaning.


263
0:15:21,407 --> 0:15:24,127
But then you'd be providing some jackass


264
0:15:24,127 --> 0:15:27,887
with a wall on which to lean
and reflect on what a jackass he is.


265
0:15:27,887 --> 0:15:31,647
l know. Here it's a conundrum.
But don't you worry about it.


266
0:15:31,647 --> 0:15:34,807
l'll tackle that one right upstairs.
ln the meantime,


267
0:15:34,807 --> 0:15:37,7
you could pretend
to be doing some work.


268
0:15:37,7 --> 0:15:39,847
And, even though
you don't have your basket,


269
0:15:39,847 --> 0:15:43,247
it's just a terrific time
for you to skip away, Shirley.


270
0:15:43,247 --> 0:15:45,87
Skip away.


271
0:15:45,87 --> 0:15:52,887
Skip away. Go ahead.


272
0:15:52,887 --> 0:15:56,287
- Hello, Philip.
- Lemon head.


273
0:15:56,287 --> 0:15:58,407
Yeah, l get it, cos of the hair.


274
0:15:58,407 --> 0:16:0,327
l was hard on you from the start,


275
0:16:0,327 --> 0:16:3,767
but, on the other hand, as you know,
you're an incredible tool.


276
0:16:3,767 --> 0:16:7,407
So l'll lay off if you drop
the attitude, and we'll start fresh.


277
0:16:7,407 --> 0:16:10,7
- What do you say?
- l don't wanna.


278
0:16:10,7 --> 0:16:13,807
But, if you've got a problem with that,
go see my father.


279
0:16:13,807 --> 0:16:16,7
l think l'll do that.


280
0:16:16,7 --> 0:16:18,887
Wait, Dr Reid.


281
0:16:18,887 --> 0:16:24,7
l had some time to think about it and,
what the hell? Let's start fresh.


282
0:16:24,7 --> 0:16:26,647
Philly...


283
0:16:26,647 --> 0:16:29,807
l don't wanna.


284
0:16:29,807 --> 0:16:31,967
Sorry we got interrupted before.


285
0:16:31,967 --> 0:16:35,407
- lt's OK.
- Where were we?


286
0:16:35,407 --> 0:16:38,807
l told you my parents were
still married, you yelled at me.


287
0:16:38,807 --> 0:16:41,447
Right. Of course l did.
That's me all over.


288
0:16:41,447 --> 0:16:45,847
- Why are you washing your hands?
- l don't honestly know.


289
0:16:45,847 --> 0:16:48,807
l guess l don't have
anything of interest to say.


290
0:16:48,807 --> 0:16:51,327
l got something to say.


291
0:16:51,327 --> 0:16:54,567
Dr Cox, you are an attending,
so you should know


292
0:16:54,567 --> 0:16:58,807
it's inappropriate for you to be
sniffing around this woman all day!


293
0:16:58,807 --> 0:17:2,447
And you! You are a med student
who should be learning from me,


294
0:17:2,447 --> 0:17:5,407
but every time l turn around,
you're talking to him.


295
0:17:5,407 --> 0:17:9,607
So l'm telling you, l forbid you
to get involved with that guy.


296
0:17:9,607 --> 0:17:11,887
Sorry, doctor.


297
0:17:11,887 --> 0:17:17,487
You do realise that you just effectively
signed your own death warrant.


298
0:17:17,487 --> 0:17:24,647
Dude, do you, like,
know any women at all?


299
0:17:24,647 --> 0:17:26,647
Hi.


300
0:17:26,647 --> 0:17:35,167
l know we're not supposed to be
seeing each other, but...


301
0:17:35,167 --> 0:17:37,607
Why did you page me?


302
0:17:37,607 --> 0:17:40,207
l don't know why l still
have this thing on.


303
0:17:40,207 --> 0:17:43,567
Put your gloves on, Josh.
l need you to get an ABG.


304
0:17:43,567 --> 0:17:46,7
- l can't.
- Newbie, wait.


305
0:17:46,7 --> 0:17:47,567
''Newbie''?


306
0:17:47,567 --> 0:17:50,727
You're the only one who knows
if you wanna be a doctor.


307
0:17:50,727 --> 0:17:53,207
But right now l got my hands full. OK?


308
0:17:53,207 --> 0:18:1,607
What do you say you put some gloves on,
Shirley, and get the hell in here?


309
0:18:1,607 --> 0:18:6,887
Now, locate the radial pulse.


310
0:18:6,887 --> 0:18:17,47
Josh, look at me. You can do this.


311
0:18:17,47 --> 0:18:20,367
lt looks good.


312
0:18:20,367 --> 0:18:22,807
No way.


313
0:18:22,807 --> 0:18:26,447
What do you want, a cookie?
Put your scrubs on and get back here.


314
0:18:26,447 --> 0:18:30,567
Go, go, go!


315
0:18:30,567 --> 0:18:32,887
Go ahead.


316
0:18:32,887 --> 0:18:35,727
That's it.


317
0:18:35,727 --> 0:18:39,687
- Could you redo that?
- Yeah.


318
0:18:39,687 --> 0:18:41,887
Could l get some more wine?


319
0:18:41,887 --> 0:18:46,207
Puh-lease, keep drinking.


320
0:18:46,207 --> 0:18:50,407
l'm throwing myself at you, and
you're still trying to get me drunk.


321
0:18:50,407 --> 0:18:56,287
Well, baby, you gotta
play all 48 minutes.


322
0:18:56,287 --> 0:18:58,847
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


323
0:18:58,847 --> 0:19:0,407
This is fun.


324
0:19:0,407 --> 0:19:3,807
l love the part right before
we start hating each other.


325
0:19:3,807 --> 0:19:6,487
- Really?
- You wanna know something?


326
0:19:6,487 --> 0:19:8,367
What?


327
0:19:8,367 --> 0:19:12,167
l feel like l'm using you
to get past another person.


328
0:19:12,167 --> 0:19:14,367
That's not as sexy as you think it is.


329
0:19:14,367 --> 0:19:16,407
lt's this nurse.


330
0:19:16,407 --> 0:19:20,687
This unavailable nurse?
l swear...


331
0:19:20,687 --> 0:19:23,927
Look, Kristen, l think you're great,


332
0:19:23,927 --> 0:19:26,487
but this whole thing's
just not fair to you.


333
0:19:26,487 --> 0:19:29,527
lf it's OK with you,


334
0:19:29,527 --> 0:19:46,367
l think l'll go ahead
and decide what's fair to me.


335
0:19:46,367 --> 0:19:49,287
That works for everybody.


336
0:19:49,287 --> 0:19:51,47
Perry?


337
0:19:51,47 --> 0:19:54,727
Actually, l prefer ''Dr Cox''.


338
0:19:54,727 --> 0:19:57,127
You like strong women, don't you?


339
0:19:57,127 --> 0:20:5,767
Are you kidding me? They're
the only ones l let ruin my life.


340
0:20:5,767 --> 0:20:9,887
- This is way too easy.
- Bring it on!


341
0:20:9,887 --> 0:20:13,167
Stop talking.


342
0:20:13,167 --> 0:20:17,807
Dr Reid, l wrote out your admission
orders and got the blood cultures.


343
0:20:17,807 --> 0:20:22,167
Good. Now, beat it. l'm eating.


344
0:20:22,167 --> 0:20:26,927
- Elliot, you ball-buster!
- l know! lsn't it great?


345
0:20:26,927 --> 0:20:29,727
<i>A lot of us freak out</i>
<i>when med students come,</i>


346
0:20:29,727 --> 0:20:33,287
<i>It feels like being forced</i>
<i>to accept new people into your family,</i>


347
0:20:33,287 --> 0:20:35,927
<i>It changes everything,</i>


348
0:20:35,927 --> 0:20:41,7
<i>Me I was more struck by how</i>
<i>these newbies made me look at myself,</i>


349
0:20:41,7 --> 0:20:44,247
<i>Who I used to be,,,</i>


350
0:20:44,247 --> 0:20:46,807
<i>,,,who I am now,,,</i>


351
0:20:46,807 --> 0:20:50,127
<i>,,,and who I might</i>
<i>some day become,</i>


352
0:20:50,127 --> 0:20:52,247
<i>But hopefully not too soon,</i>


353
0:20:52,247 --> 0:20:54,647
- <i>Player</i>
- <i>Hold me down</i>


354
0:20:54,647 --> 0:20:56,927
- Such dorks.
- My God!


355
0:20:56,927 --> 0:22:56,927
''My God!''
