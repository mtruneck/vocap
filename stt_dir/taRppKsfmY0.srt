CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Well, of course, we
wish you a very happy new year and a very


5
0:0:30,46 --> 0:0:36,23
warm welcome as we kick off 2013 on CNN STUDENT
NEWS. My name is Carl Azuz. We are glad you`re


6
0:0:36,23 --> 0:0:39,91
joining us. We hope your year is off to a
good start.


7
0:0:39,91 --> 0:0:44,62
One question we had going in to the break
was, will Congress and President Obama find


8
0:0:44,62 --> 0:0:49,78
a way to avoid the fiscal cliff? When we put
this show together last night, we still had


9
0:0:49,78 --> 0:0:54,3
that question. What came to be knows is the
fiscal cliff was really a series of automatic


10
0:0:54,3 --> 0:0:58,77
tax increases and government spending cuts
that were scheduled to take effect at the


11
0:0:58,77 --> 0:0:59,98
start of the year.


12
0:0:59,98 --> 0:1:4,509
The reason - U.S. Government has too much
debt. Now, the president and Congress could


13
0:1:4,509 --> 0:1:9,53
have avoided that fiscal cliff by coming up
with the compromise, a different plan to reduce


14
0:1:9,53 --> 0:1:15,97
the debt. But as of yesterday, still no agreement.
There are two main ways to reduce debt: cut


15
0:1:15,97 --> 0:1:22,61
down on spending and or raise taxes. One big
sticking point was whom to raise taxes on


16
0:1:22,61 --> 0:1:28,84
and by how much? The president wanted families
making more than $250,000 a year to pay more


17
0:1:28,84 --> 0:1:34,17
in taxes. He said they could afford it. Critics
said the economy is too weak to raise taxes


18
0:1:34,17 --> 0:1:35,7
on anyone.


19
0:1:35,7 --> 0:1:41,53
The Senate came up with a bipartisan compromise
to raise taxes, but only on families making


20
0:1:41,53 --> 0:1:48,28
more than $450,00 a year. The plan would be
a temporary fix, it would last for two months,


21
0:1:48,28 --> 0:1:52,38
and it would delay any cuts in government
spending. The thing is, the compromise also


22
0:1:52,38 --> 0:1:57,229
has to pass the U.S. House of Representatives,
and it wasn`t clear yesterday if it would


23
0:1:57,229 --> 0:1:59,909
do that. Cnn.com has your latest updates.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me.
I was born in Chicago in 1947. In 1992, my


26
0:2:11,47 --> 0:2:18,6
husband was elected president and in the year
2000, I was elected to the U.S. Senate. I`m


27
0:2:18,6 --> 0:2:24,95
the only former first lady to have served
there and in the presidential cabinet.


28
0:2:24,95 --> 0:2:30,22
I`m Hillary Clinton, the current U.S. Secretary
of State.

30
0:2:33,4 --> 0:2:37,609
AZUZ: Secretary Clinton spent New Year`s day
in the hospital after getting a blood clot


31
0:2:37,609 --> 0:2:42,12
in her head. Doctors say she`s on blood thinners
to dissolve the clot and they expect she`ll


32
0:2:42,12 --> 0:2:47,38
be OK. This is the latest of a few health
issues she had. Clinton caught a stomach virus


33
0:2:47,38 --> 0:2:52,49
in December, which made her dehydrated. She
fainted because of that, which gave her a


34
0:2:52,49 --> 0:2:56,459
concussion. This blood clot was a result of
that concussion. Clinton had to stay home


35
0:2:56,459 --> 0:3:2,9
for most of December. She didn`t testify as
scheduled about September`s deadly terrorist


36
0:3:2,9 --> 0:3:7,739
attack on the U.S. Building in Benghazi, Libya.
Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores what`s next in her


37
0:3:7,739 --> 0:3:8,19
recovery.


38
0:3:8,19 --> 0:3:12,299
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is
a blood vessel that actually drains blood


39
0:3:12,299 --> 0:3:16,51
away from the brain. It`s called the cerebral
vein, and I want to show you here, we know


40
0:3:16,51 --> 0:3:20,65
that in Secretary Clinton`s case it is actually
on the right side of her head, somewhere in


41
0:3:20,65 --> 0:3:23,73
this area, it`s called the right transverse
sinus.


42
0:3:23,73 --> 0:3:28,769
Let me show you on this model here, I`ll show
you the left side just for sake of demonstration


43
0:3:28,769 --> 0:3:33,28
here. I removed the hemisphere of the brain
here. You can actually see where the - where


44
0:3:33,28 --> 0:3:37,87
the veins are. You see that blue area right
in there. That is the area that is actually


45
0:3:37,87 --> 0:3:43,3
draining blood away from the brain. And one
of these veins in this area, that`s where


46
0:3:43,3 --> 0:3:48,59
that clot actually has occurred. Most likely,
due to a combination of the head trauma that


47
0:3:48,59 --> 0:3:53,709
she had a few weeks ago in addition to the
fact that she has had a problem with blood


48
0:3:53,709 --> 0:3:58,43
clots in the past, dating back to 1998. We
heard from her doctors. They say that she`s


49
0:3:58,43 --> 0:4:2,4
on blood winners, they say she`s awake, she`s
talking. And most importantly, there is no


50
0:4:2,4 --> 0:4:6,299
evidence of stroke or neurological damage.


51
0:4:6,299 --> 0:4:9,9
My guess is that they are going to monitor
her at least for another couple of days in


52
0:4:9,9 --> 0:4:13,739
the hospital and probably get another scan
at some point to make sure that clot is in


53
0:4:13,739 --> 0:4:18,829
fact dissolved as the result of those blood-
thinning medications. As we get more details,


54
0:4:18,829 --> 0:4:21,13
we certainly bring them to you. Back to you
for now.


55
0:4:21,13 --> 0:4:22,72
AZUZ: Thank you, Dr. Gupta.


56
0:4:22,72 --> 0:4:26,97
For a while now, Secretary Clinton has been
planning to step down from her position, once


57
0:4:26,97 --> 0:4:31,919
a new nominee is confirmed by the Senate.
The president`s choice for the job is this


58
0:4:31,919 --> 0:4:35,91
man, Senator John Kerry. You might have heard
that name before. He ran for president and


59
0:4:35,91 --> 0:4:42,569
lost to incumbent president, George W. Bush
in 2004. On December 21st, President Obama


60
0:4:42,569 --> 0:4:47,699
nominated Kerry for U.S. Secretary of State.
He`s done extensive traveling and met with


61
0:4:47,699 --> 0:4:52,46
international officials on behalf of the Obama
administration, but as many of you have already


62
0:4:52,46 --> 0:4:57,71
learned, Kerry`s nomination doesn`t necessarily
mean he`ll get the job. The Senate will have


63
0:4:57,71 --> 0:5:1,61
the final say as part of the advice and consent
it gives the president.

65
0:5:2,8 --> 0:5:7,96
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Time for the year`s first
"Shoutout." Which of the following is associated


66
0:5:7,96 --> 0:5:12,55
with Abraham Lincoln: if you think you know
the answer, then shout it out!


67
0:5:12,55 --> 0:5:19,3
Is it the Treaty of Paris, Emancipation Proclamation,
Articles of Confederation or Treaty of Versailles?


68
0:5:19,3 --> 0:5:28,9
You`ve got three seconds, go!


69
0:5:28,9 --> 0:5:36,3
President Abraham Lincoln`s Emancipation Proclamation
took effect on January 1, 1863. That`s your


70
0:5:36,3 --> 0:5:40,919
answer and that`s your shoutout.


71
0:5:40,919 --> 0:5:47,689
And that made January 1, 2013 the 150th anniversary
of when the Emancipation Proclamation took


72
0:5:47,689 --> 0:5:53,129
effect. In honor of that. U.S. Postal Service
unveiled this new stamp yesterday.


73
0:5:53,129 --> 0:5:57,0
President Lincoln`s proclamation was made
during the U.S. Civil War. It said that anyone


74
0:5:57,0 --> 0:6:3,879
who was a slave in a rebellious state was
set free. It didn`t apply to all U.S. States,


75
0:6:3,879 --> 0:6:8,409
and it didn`t officially end slavery in the
U.S. The 13th Amendment did that. But the


76
0:6:8,409 --> 0:6:11,83
Emancipation Proclamation helped pave the
way to the end of slavery.


77
0:6:11,83 --> 0:6:16,68
Of course, there are a number of new laws
in effect as of yesterday. Last fall, we told


78
0:6:16,68 --> 0:6:21,52
you a couple of states were legalizing recreational
marijuana. In some others, voters approved


79
0:6:21,52 --> 0:6:27,3
same sex marriage. Here are a few laws you
might not have known about. In Illinois and


80
0:6:27,3 --> 0:6:32,36
California, employers can no longer require
workers to share their social media passwords.


81
0:6:32,36 --> 0:6:37,28
Some privacy concerns about that. Also, if
you live in Illinois, forget about shark fins


82
0:6:37,28 --> 0:6:42,199
soup, it`s now illegal to have shark fins
at all. And you could get fined to thousand


83
0:6:42,199 --> 0:6:47,499
bucks if you pop a wheely on a motorcycle.
If you own a swamp buggy in Florida, you no


84
0:6:47,499 --> 0:6:52,31
longer have to register it as a motor vehicle,
that will save some folks a step. Concord,


85
0:6:52,31 --> 0:6:56,879
Massachusetts has officially banned plastic
bottles. They could be confiscated and as


86
0:6:56,879 --> 0:7:2,62
far as animals go, cat lovers in Wellington,
Kansas, might call a new law, catty (ph).


87
0:7:2,62 --> 0:7:6,9
It says you can`t have more than four felines
living in your house. And if you`ve got a


88
0:7:6,9 --> 0:7:10,979
wild hog in Kentucky, you`d better not release
it into the wild. Officials don`t want their


89
0:7:10,979 --> 0:7:13,9
state to become a hog haven.


90
0:7:13,9 --> 0:7:17,5
Well, if you live in or near major city, you
might have heard some fire works the other


91
0:7:17,5 --> 0:7:22,46
night, as people welcome 2013 with a bang.
Times Square topped off today`s show, but


92
0:7:22,46 --> 0:7:27,46
before we sign off we are going to give you
