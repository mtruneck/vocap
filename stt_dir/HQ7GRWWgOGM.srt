1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:13,284



2
0:0:13,284 --> 0:0:14,4
DAVID CHOE: Three.


3
0:0:14,4 --> 0:0:17,17
Season three, "Thumbs Up."
What's up, everyone?


4
0:0:17,17 --> 0:0:18,7
My name is David Choe.


5
0:0:18,7 --> 0:0:21,42
I'm here with the son of my
uncle's cousin, Harry Kim, AKA


6
0:0:21,42 --> 0:0:25,4
Guam Cruise, AKA Horny
Kim, AKA Harry Kim.


7
0:0:25,4 --> 0:0:26,72
Gettin' down.


8
0:0:26,72 --> 0:0:28,5
Got ribs.


9
0:0:28,5 --> 0:0:33,26
Anyways, "Thumbs Up." This is
a show about hitchhiking,


10
0:0:33,26 --> 0:0:36,13
riding trains, riding airplanes,
riding boats.


11
0:0:36,13 --> 0:0:38,63
Any means necessary to
get across whatever


12
0:0:38,63 --> 0:0:40,12
country that might be.


13
0:0:40,12 --> 0:0:42,15
Today that country happens
to be China.


14
0:0:42,15 --> 0:0:43,7
That's where we are right now.


15
0:0:43,7 --> 0:0:44,79
In BJ, Beijing.


16
0:0:44,79 --> 0:0:46,98
A city known for Peking
Duck and hand release.


17
0:0:46,98 --> 0:0:50,6
And it's the art capital
of the world right now.


18
0:0:50,6 --> 0:0:51,96
We're going to hitchhike
across this country.


19
0:0:51,96 --> 0:0:54,81
We're going to go someplace,
maybe warm, someplace


20
0:0:54,81 --> 0:0:57,2
hopefully where there's
gambling and some


21
0:0:57,2 --> 0:0:58,45
nice looking ladies.


22
0:0:58,45 --> 0:1:2,13



23
0:1:2,13 --> 0:1:4,0
We're going to start that
adventure today.


24
0:1:4,0 --> 0:1:5,865
But before we start--


25
0:1:5,865 --> 0:1:8,3
you know, in a perfect world,
I would make a living from


26
0:1:8,3 --> 0:1:8,75
hitchhiking.


27
0:1:8,75 --> 0:1:11,93
Unfortunately, I make my living
from drawing pictures,


28
0:1:11,93 --> 0:1:14,6
and painting stuff, and pushing
pigment around.


29
0:1:14,6 --> 0:1:15,0
And that's what brought
me here.


30
0:1:15,0 --> 0:1:17,2
I have my first art
show in China.


31
0:1:17,2 --> 0:1:19,39
So come on America,
come on China.


32
0:1:19,39 --> 0:1:20,96
Come see what I do
for a living.


33
0:1:20,96 --> 0:1:22,56
Why don't you get to know
me a little bit?


34
0:1:22,56 --> 0:1:24,8
Let's check out some art.


35
0:1:24,8 --> 0:1:25,532
"Thumbs Up" season three.


36
0:1:25,532 --> 0:1:29,735



37
0:1:29,735 --> 0:1:30,42
Hey.


38
0:1:30,42 --> 0:1:31,67
Let's go to look my room.


39
0:1:31,67 --> 0:1:35,6



40
0:1:35,6 --> 0:1:36,7
Oh.


41
0:1:36,7 --> 0:1:37,785
Look who we have here.


42
0:1:37,785 --> 0:1:43,3



43
0:1:43,3 --> 0:1:48,55
So, this is basically where
I've been living for


44
0:1:48,55 --> 0:1:49,67
the last two weeks.


45
0:1:49,67 --> 0:1:50,76
Three weeks, now.


46
0:1:50,76 --> 0:1:54,36
And this is where I stay, where
I put my whole show of


47
0:1:54,36 --> 0:1:56,1
art together for China.


48
0:1:56,1 --> 0:1:57,51
I never been here before.


49
0:1:57,51 --> 0:2:0,68
And the skies were grey, there's
soldiers, there's


50
0:2:0,68 --> 0:2:1,88
dirty ass street markets.


51
0:2:1,88 --> 0:2:4,74
And all this stuff was amazing
for inspiration for all the


52
0:2:4,74 --> 0:2:6,72
paintings and stuff,
but it's bleak.


53
0:2:6,72 --> 0:2:8,36
There's nothing out
where I am.


54
0:2:8,36 --> 0:2:10,74
And I was painting like
I was a monk.


55
0:2:10,74 --> 0:2:14,47
And I got really
fuckin' horny.


56
0:2:14,47 --> 0:2:16,62
I wanted to fuck so bad.


57
0:2:16,62 --> 0:2:17,95
But I don't speak
the language.


58
0:2:17,95 --> 0:2:20,0
I don't speak one
word of Chinese.


59
0:2:20,0 --> 0:2:21,81
From here, we went
to the mall.


60
0:2:21,81 --> 0:2:23,45
It was the first time
I had been around


61
0:2:23,45 --> 0:2:24,84
women in three weeks.


62
0:2:24,84 --> 0:2:28,6
So I was looking pretty much
how I look now, sleazy as


63
0:2:28,6 --> 0:2:32,46
fuck, holding a bucket of KFC,
eating the chicken, going down


64
0:2:32,46 --> 0:2:34,77
the elevator, trying
to look up skirts.


65
0:2:34,77 --> 0:2:35,69
Trying to hit on girls.


66
0:2:35,69 --> 0:2:36,77
Ni hao.


67
0:2:36,77 --> 0:2:40,3
Not having very good
luck with it.


68
0:2:40,3 --> 0:2:42,16
I just got a raging boner
at the Chinese mall.


69
0:2:42,16 --> 0:2:45,9



70
0:2:45,9 --> 0:2:46,54
I couldn't [INAUDIBLE]


71
0:2:46,54 --> 0:2:47,39
to any of these girls.


72
0:2:47,39 --> 0:2:52,49
So I came back to this
room right here.


73
0:2:52,49 --> 0:2:54,646
Harry was pretending
to be sleeping.


74
0:2:54,646 --> 0:3:0,8
And I fucking jacked off day
and night for 36 hours.


75
0:3:0,8 --> 0:3:6,625
And in this angle right here,
after my my penis was stuck to


76
0:3:6,625 --> 0:3:8,93
my leg like this and
I couldn't fucking


77
0:3:8,93 --> 0:3:9,86
touch myself anymore.


78
0:3:9,86 --> 0:3:14,18
I looked up his metal ceiling
beams right here.


79
0:3:14,18 --> 0:3:16,9
And there's like a metal
rust pattern on there.


80
0:3:16,9 --> 0:3:21,58
And in my zapped out state, that
pattern of the old man


81
0:3:21,58 --> 0:3:23,35
popped out at me.


82
0:3:23,35 --> 0:3:26,19
So I grabbed my sketchbook and I
started drawing this old man


83
0:3:26,19 --> 0:3:27,29
staring at me.


84
0:3:27,29 --> 0:3:30,84
This sort of became a catalyst
for the new shit that I did


85
0:3:30,84 --> 0:3:34,5
out here, which was this old
pervert, hanging out at the


86
0:3:34,5 --> 0:3:36,2
mall, staring at chicks.


87
0:3:36,2 --> 0:3:38,2
Everyone always asks me
what my art's about.


88
0:3:38,2 --> 0:3:43,36
And it's about the gigantic
pervert that lives inside me.


89
0:3:43,36 --> 0:3:44,17
Scumbag.


90
0:3:44,17 --> 0:3:45,42
We're all scumbags.


91
0:3:45,42 --> 0:3:53,1



92
0:3:53,1 --> 0:3:54,63
So this is the old man.


93
0:3:54,63 --> 0:3:57,1
This is the oil painting I did
from that little sketch from


94
0:3:57,1 --> 0:3:58,75
the old man on the ceiling.


95
0:3:58,75 --> 0:4:2,734
And I did a ton of
these outside.


96
0:4:2,734 --> 0:4:10,901
FEMALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING CHINESE]


97
0:4:10,901 --> 0:4:13,91
DAVID CHOE: I tried to talk to
many girls today so far, and


98
0:4:13,91 --> 0:4:15,2
none of them speak English.


99
0:4:15,2 --> 0:4:17,87
Mia seems to speak perfect
English, so we're going to


100
0:4:17,87 --> 0:4:18,93
talk to her a little bit.


101
0:4:18,93 --> 0:4:20,322
MIA: And I'm such a fan.


102
0:4:20,322 --> 0:4:21,25
DAVID CHOE: You're a fan?


103
0:4:21,25 --> 0:4:21,83
MIA: Yes I am.


104
0:4:21,83 --> 0:4:22,92
DAVID CHOE: Oh, cool.


105
0:4:22,92 --> 0:4:25,5
Me and Harry are going to
leave tomorrow on a


106
0:4:25,5 --> 0:4:26,3
hitchhiking trip.


107
0:4:26,3 --> 0:4:27,19
you Do you think anyone's
going to pick us up?


108
0:4:27,19 --> 0:4:29,161
Do you think it's a good
idea, a bad idea?


109
0:4:29,161 --> 0:4:32,107
MIA: I just think it's going
to be tough, because


110
0:4:32,107 --> 0:4:36,35
hitchhiking is not really
part of Chinese culture.


111
0:4:36,35 --> 0:4:37,17
Are you just going to do this?


112
0:4:37,17 --> 0:4:39,48
Or are you going to have
a little board?


113
0:4:39,48 --> 0:4:41,24
DAVID CHOE: If we make a sign,
what should the sign say?


114
0:4:41,24 --> 0:4:44,65
MIA: Say, pick me up,
I'm an artist.


115
0:4:44,65 --> 0:4:47,19
DAVID CHOE: Pick me
up, I'm an artist?


116
0:4:47,19 --> 0:4:50,8
Other signs we've had in
America, we just write, we


117
0:4:50,8 --> 0:4:52,1
have vaginas.


118
0:4:52,1 --> 0:4:53,37
And we toss salads.


119
0:4:53,37 --> 0:4:56,6
And that's the signs we have.


120
0:4:56,6 --> 0:4:57,33
MIA: Wow.


121
0:4:57,33 --> 0:4:57,95
Good luck.


122
0:4:57,95 --> 0:4:59,2
DAVID CHOE: Good luck, OK.


123
0:4:59,2 --> 0:5:4,0



124
0:5:4,0 --> 0:5:6,18
So, Harry's sister
lives in China.


125
0:5:6,18 --> 0:5:9,4
And I told him, no
hoes on the road.


126
0:5:9,4 --> 0:5:10,49
We got to keep it bros only.


127
0:5:10,49 --> 0:5:12,31
And this fucking guy.


128
0:5:12,31 --> 0:5:15,45
And his sister's the most
fucking annoying--


129
0:5:15,45 --> 0:5:16,49
why did you do that?


130
0:5:16,49 --> 0:5:17,45
HARRY KIM: I don't know.


131
0:5:17,45 --> 0:5:18,604
We're in the same city, dude.


132
0:5:18,604 --> 0:5:19,11
I don't know.


133
0:5:19,11 --> 0:5:19,84
DAVID CHOE: Shh.


134
0:5:19,84 --> 0:5:20,91
Here she comes.


135
0:5:20,91 --> 0:5:21,42
Hi, Stephanie.


136
0:5:21,42 --> 0:5:21,95
STEPHANIE: Hey!


137
0:5:21,95 --> 0:5:22,719
HARRY KIM: Hi, Stephanie!


138
0:5:22,719 --> 0:5:23,969
Hey!


139
0:5:23,969 --> 0:5:26,342



140
0:5:26,342 --> 0:5:27,592
DAVID CHOE: Hi, hi.


141
0:5:27,592 --> 0:5:30,76



142
0:5:30,76 --> 0:5:31,36
So.


143
0:5:31,36 --> 0:5:31,92
How's China?


144
0:5:31,92 --> 0:5:33,198
STEPHANIE: It's good.


145
0:5:33,198 --> 0:5:34,89
What the fuck?


146
0:5:34,89 --> 0:5:38,335
You guys going to try and go
on a roadtrip without me?


147
0:5:38,335 --> 0:5:39,5
DAVID CHOE: All right.


148
0:5:39,5 --> 0:5:40,47
You really want to come?


149
0:5:40,47 --> 0:5:43,21
STEPHANIE: Yeah, please.


150
0:5:43,21 --> 0:5:46,86
DAVID CHOE: All right, so I have
had fun talking to people


151
0:5:46,86 --> 0:5:48,15
in Chinese that don't
speak Chinese.


152
0:5:48,15 --> 0:5:52,3
But Stephanie speaks a little
Chinese, so she can help us.


153
0:5:52,3 --> 0:5:55,19
This might fuck up the
combo we have.


154
0:5:55,19 --> 0:5:56,44
The equation.


155
0:5:56,44 --> 0:6:2,3



156
0:6:2,3 --> 0:6:2,37
All right.


157
0:6:2,37 --> 0:6:3,62
Let's do it.


158
0:6:3,62 --> 0:6:9,568



159
0:6:9,568 --> 0:6:11,35
What else do we need here?


160
0:6:11,35 --> 0:6:12,502
HARRY KIM: Just a suit.


161
0:6:12,502 --> 0:6:13,7
DAVID CHOE: I gotta
look sharp.


162
0:6:13,7 --> 0:6:14,24
I'm going hitchhiking.


163
0:6:14,24 --> 0:6:15,645
I gotta look slick.


164
0:6:15,645 --> 0:6:19,5



165
0:6:19,5 --> 0:6:21,46
How's that look?


166
0:6:21,46 --> 0:6:22,93
HARRY KIM: It's sharp.


167
0:6:22,93 --> 0:6:25,87
DAVID CHOE: All right.


168
0:6:25,87 --> 0:6:27,0
We've got cabbage.


169
0:6:27,0 --> 0:6:28,56
We got mad cabbage.


170
0:6:28,56 --> 0:6:29,525
All we need is a ride.


171
0:6:29,525 --> 0:6:37,432
STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]


172
0:6:37,432 --> 0:6:38,12
DAVID CHOE: Thumbs up!


173
0:6:38,12 --> 0:6:39,37
HARRY KIM: Thumbs up.


174
0:6:39,37 --> 0:6:46,264



175
0:6:46,264 --> 0:6:48,86
DAVID CHOE: Me, Stephanie, and
Harry, we just got a ride from


176
0:6:48,86 --> 0:6:51,4
the darkest Chinese man I've
ever seen in my life, with the


177
0:6:51,4 --> 0:6:53,2
most beautiful smile.


178
0:6:53,2 --> 0:6:56,34
He just dropped us off in this
bombed-out building.


179
0:6:56,34 --> 0:6:57,65
The gallery kicked me out.


180
0:6:57,65 --> 0:6:58,85
I'm in Beijing still.


181
0:6:58,85 --> 0:7:1,59
I think this is a good place to
set up camp for tonight and


182
0:7:1,59 --> 0:7:3,8
the get ready to head out.


183
0:7:3,8 --> 0:7:6,19
I wasn't ready for our new
addition, but let's see


184
0:7:6,19 --> 0:7:7,33
how it works out.


185
0:7:7,33 --> 0:7:8,58
Let's check out the spot.


186
0:7:8,58 --> 0:7:11,142



187
0:7:11,142 --> 0:7:15,3
HARRY KIM: This looks nice.


188
0:7:15,3 --> 0:7:16,42
DAVID CHOE: Goodnight,
America.


189
0:7:16,42 --> 0:7:17,53
Thumbs up.


190
0:7:17,53 --> 0:7:19,5
Thumbs up, China.


191
0:7:19,5 --> 0:7:20,65
I love you, even though you
don't speak English.


192
0:7:20,65 --> 0:7:21,89
Engrish.


193
0:7:21,89 --> 0:7:23,14
See you tomorrow.


194
0:7:23,14 --> 0:7:28,51



195
0:7:28,51 --> 0:7:30,94
"Thumbs Up," China.


196
0:7:30,94 --> 0:7:34,7
It's our second day on the road,
our third day filming.


197
0:7:34,7 --> 0:7:38,45
So I guess, officially, "Thumbs
Up" China, season


198
0:7:38,45 --> 0:7:41,84
three, day three.


199
0:7:41,84 --> 0:7:42,96
Horrible sleep last night.


200
0:7:42,96 --> 0:7:45,66
The smell of petrified shit
filling our nose.


201
0:7:45,66 --> 0:7:48,68
We ended up waking
up super early.


202
0:7:48,68 --> 0:7:52,73
Beijing's cool, but I'm ready
to see the rest of China.


203
0:7:52,73 --> 0:7:54,8
I guess in China you can walk
right on to the freeway.


204
0:7:54,8 --> 0:8:1,39



205
0:8:1,39 --> 0:8:3,47
We're trying to get a ride.


206
0:8:3,47 --> 0:8:6,63
I'm pretty tired.


207
0:8:6,63 --> 0:8:8,34
Let's see if she can get
something going.


208
0:8:8,34 --> 0:8:12,38



209
0:8:12,38 --> 0:8:16,12
I've never traveled with
a female companion.


210
0:8:16,12 --> 0:8:21,66
Harry's always been enough woman
for me to get a ride.


211
0:8:21,66 --> 0:8:23,35
Stephanie's working her magic.


212
0:8:23,35 --> 0:8:27,13
We'll see if her female charms
work against the gruff Chinese


213
0:8:27,13 --> 0:8:28,23
truck drivers.


214
0:8:28,23 --> 0:8:31,7
In America, the truck drivers
almost never pick up because


215
0:8:31,7 --> 0:8:32,68
of insurance reasons.


216
0:8:32,68 --> 0:8:34,15
I don't know if it's
the same out here.


217
0:8:34,15 --> 0:8:44,93
STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]


218
0:8:44,93 --> 0:8:45,91
DAVID CHOE: All right.


219
0:8:45,91 --> 0:8:48,36
There's one more truck
right there.


220
0:8:48,36 --> 0:8:52,77



221
0:8:52,77 --> 0:8:55,51
Stephanie's first try, fail.


222
0:8:55,51 --> 0:8:56,9
But don't be mad.


223
0:8:56,9 --> 0:8:57,58
There's another truck.


224
0:8:57,58 --> 0:8:58,8
Let's give it another shot.


225
0:8:58,8 --> 0:9:2,5
There's another truck, too.


226
0:9:2,5 --> 0:9:3,29
I think our chances are
going to be good here.


227
0:9:3,29 --> 0:9:6,73
They said nobody picks up
hitchhikers, but we'll see


228
0:9:6,73 --> 0:9:7,98
what happens.


229
0:9:7,98 --> 0:9:10,23



230
0:9:10,23 --> 0:9:11,5
Tell him he's very handsome and
I want to interview him


231
0:9:11,5 --> 0:9:12,5
while he's driving.

236
0:9:23,59 --> 0:9:24,55
All right!


237
0:9:24,55 --> 0:9:27,7
Yes.


238
0:9:27,7 --> 0:9:30,51
A lovely couple, empty
bus, our first ride.


239
0:9:30,51 --> 0:9:31,76
Thumbs up, China.


240
0:9:31,76 --> 0:9:41,19



241
0:9:41,19 --> 0:9:42,67
Hey, tell them I'm going to
sing a song for them.


242
0:9:42,67 --> 0:9:46,58



243
0:9:46,58 --> 0:9:47,994

understand you.

248
0:9:53,116 --> 0:9:55,57



249
0:9:55,57 --> 0:9:56,38
It doesn't get [INAUDIBLE]


250
0:9:56,38 --> 0:9:56,93
than this.


251
0:9:56,93 --> 0:9:58,39
America, look.


252
0:9:58,39 --> 0:10:1,266
We just got our first ride.


253
0:10:1,266 --> 0:10:3,38
Look, a completely empty bus.


254
0:10:3,38 --> 0:10:4,97
There's no one in here.


255
0:10:4,97 --> 0:10:9,7
And we got fruits, snacks,
and a gold mic.


256
0:10:9,7 --> 0:10:13,2
Stephanie, you want
to take a song?


257
0:10:13,2 --> 0:10:15,35
Stephanie failed on
her first try.


258
0:10:15,35 --> 0:10:17,64
Her second try popped
her cherry.


259
0:10:17,64 --> 0:10:19,52
You got a ride.


260
0:10:19,52 --> 0:10:22,596
Man, fuck everyone that said
we're not going to get picked


261
0:10:22,596 --> 0:10:23,35
up in China.


262
0:10:23,35 --> 0:10:24,62
High five, everyone.


263
0:10:24,62 --> 0:10:25,59
Come on.


264
0:10:25,59 --> 0:10:27,53
High five, high five,
high five.


265
0:10:27,53 --> 0:10:28,78
High five, come on.


266
0:10:28,78 --> 0:10:32,38



267
0:10:32,38 --> 0:10:35,14
Is she mad that her husband
picked us up?

STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]


269
0:10:36,9 --> 0:10:37,77

no, she's not pissed.


272
0:10:40,59 --> 0:10:43,42



273
0:10:43,42 --> 0:10:46,8
I would very much like to
find a Chinese wife for


274
0:10:46,8 --> 0:10:48,29
myself or for Harry.


275
0:10:48,29 --> 0:10:51,22
But all the Chinese go so far
say they don't like us because


276
0:10:51,22 --> 0:10:53,21
we play around too much.


277
0:10:53,21 --> 0:10:55,451
A Chinese girl?


278
0:10:55,451 --> 0:10:57,527
STEPHANIE: She says how
can Chinese people


279
0:10:57,527 --> 0:10:58,155
not like you guys?


280
0:10:58,155 --> 0:11:0,8

what I'm saying.

The guy is dropping me by
the Great Wall of China.

0:12:7,31 --> 0:12:9,35
I've fucking wanted to paint
the Great Wall of China my

happening now.

0:12:29,615 --> 0:12:31,7
Is this the Great

0:12:38,9 --> 0:12:40,35
This is fucking awesome.


318
0:12:40,35 --> 0:12:42,79
Just got our first ride, and he
dropped us off at the Great

0:12:42,79 --> 0:12:44,624
fucking Wall of China.


320
0:12:44,624 --> 0:12:46,91
I'm going to fucking paint that

0:13:2,65 --> 0:13:5,42

323
0:13:5,42 --> 0:13:9,5
Another one, off
the checklist.


324
0:13:9,5 --> 0:13:12,5
Was to paint the entire
Great Wall of China.


325
0:13:12,5 --> 0:13:14,57
But that was what I was young,
dumb, and full of cum.


326
0:13:14,57 --> 0:13:17,34
I'm fucking about to turn
33 in a couple of weeks.

get out of here.

0:13:37,485 --> 0:13:43,69



337
0:13:43,69 --> 0:13:46,82

this restaurant, and I don't


338
0:13:46,82 --> 0:13:48,6
understand Chinese and
Stephanie's taking a shit.


339
0:13:48,6 --> 0:13:52,8
But basically, I think these
girls think Harry's Buddha.


340
0:13:52,8 --> 0:13:54,856
They started rubbing his belly
and catcalling him.


341
0:13:54,856 --> 0:13:56,106
Look at him, they're
loving it.


342
0:13:56,106 --> 0:14:5,81



343
0:14:5,81 --> 0:14:7,41
He just danced and
took pictures


344
0:14:7,41 --> 0:14:7,86
with them for an hour.


345
0:14:7,86 --> 0:14:11,32
They gave us a free tofu
and a free chicken.


346
0:14:11,32 --> 0:14:12,59
The guy's a pimp, man.


347
0:14:12,59 --> 0:14:13,5
He's fucking Buddha.


348
0:14:13,5 --> 0:14:14,69
The funky Buddha.


349
0:14:14,69 --> 0:14:16,55
Look, all the chefs came
out to see us.


350

0:14:39,3 --> 0:14:43,17

360
0:14:43,17 --> 0:14:46,2
Yesterday was a pretty
amazing day.


361
0:14:46,2 --> 0:14:48,79
We have a wonderful new
addition to the team.


362
0:14:48,79 --> 0:14:52,69
Miss Stephanie is
here to help us.


363
0:14:52,69 --> 0:14:55,18
I don't think I've ever gotten
a ride so quickly.


364
0:14:55,18 --> 0:14:57,37
She did a fail on the first ride
and then we got picked up


365
0:14:57,37 --> 0:14:59,88
on the second one by
a tour bus couple.


366
0:14:59,88 --> 0:15:5,27
And then we offered them our
singing dog boy Harry as a


367
0:15:5,27 --> 0:15:6,25
side show attraction.


368
0:15:6,25 --> 0:15:10,1
And they refused, but they did
give us a pretty awesome ride.


369
0:15:10,1 --> 0:15:12,1
I got to fulfill my lifelong
fantasy of


370
0:15:12,1 --> 0:15:13,39
painting the Great Wall.


371
0:15:13,39 --> 0:15:16,44
And then we ended up in a
town last night called--


372
0:15:16,44 --> 0:15:17,96
hey, what's the name
of this town?


373
0:15:17,96 --> 0:15:19,28
STEPHANIE: We're in
Datong, right?


374
0:15:19,28 --> 0:15:20,67
DAVID CHOE: We're in Datong.


375
0:15:20,67 --> 0:15:23,847
DAVID CHOE: They said it's the
stepping point to Mongolia.


376
0:15:23,847 --> 0:15:26,282
But it's also the dust
bowl of China.


377
0:15:26,282 --> 0:15:27,743
DAVID CHOE: Mongolia?


378
0:15:27,743 --> 0:15:29,996
STEPHANIE: We should go west
along the Yellow River.


379
0:15:29,996 --> 0:15:33,65
DAVID CHOE: All right,
let's go.


380
0:15:33,65 --> 0:15:36,8
I got this suit made,
and the crotch


381
0:15:36,8 --> 0:15:39,54
ripped while I was squatting.


382
0:15:39,54 --> 0:15:42,39
I don't know how to sew,
so I have duct tape


383
0:15:42,39 --> 0:15:44,64
and this red shit.


384
0:15:44,64 --> 0:15:53,56
Stephanie, she found a place
to get my pants fixed.

386
0:15:54,83 --> 0:15:56,98

387
0:15:56,98 --> 0:15:59,21
I went like this and it
went (RIPPING SOUND).

STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]


389
0:16:5,56 --> 0:16:6,81
They want you to go inside.


390
0:16:6,81 --> 0:16:9,73



391
0:16:9,73 --> 0:16:11,97
Did I scare the ladies off?


392
0:16:11,97 --> 0:16:13,22
It's right here.


393
0:16:13,22 --> 0:16:27,65



394
0:16:27,65 --> 0:16:30,27
So, not a good day for me.


395
0:16:30,27 --> 0:16:31,418
I ripped my pants.


396
0:16:31,418 --> 0:16:35,72
I just got my pants fixed.


397
0:16:35,72 --> 0:16:38,87
I'm pretty sick, I think I
have the flu, and I have


398
0:16:38,87 --> 0:16:40,41
explosive diarrhea.


399
0:16:40,41 --> 0:16:42,79
I had to shit four times this
morning already, almost once


400
0:16:42,79 --> 0:16:44,4
in my pants.


401
0:16:44,4 --> 0:16:46,11



402
0:16:46,11 --> 0:16:47,36
All right, let's go.


403
0:16:47,36 --> 0:16:50,79



404
0:16:50,79 --> 0:16:54,26
Either the Chinese Santa Claus
lives here, or the Chinese


405
0:16:54,26 --> 0:16:55,51
Spider-Man.
