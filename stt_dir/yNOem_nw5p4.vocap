###1 MOKO ALI, STUDENT: Hello, CNN STUDENT NEWS. My name is Moko. I`m in the seventh grade,
###6 I attend the Neighborhood School in Memphis, Tennessee. And what our school did for the
###10 season of giving, is we attended Loshmanor. Loshmanor is a place for assisted living and
###16 we sat with them and sang songs, and we also ate with them.
###21 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###21 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Fridays are awesome. A big thanks to Moko for that "I-Report",
###26 we are going to have more season of giving stories later on. I`m Carl Azuz, this is our
###30 last show of 2012, it starts right now.
###46 Today is December 21st. It is the first official day of winter, but the weather was not looking
###51 at the calendar, the season`s first blizzard hit the Midwestern U.S. Early this week, it
###57 was headed and expected to move into New England today. Tens of thousands of people lost power.
###62 This storm also made driving pretty dangerous, as you might expect in some areas. Nearly
###67 100 accidents were reported by late Wednesday morning, including a 30-car pileup on one
###72 Iowa highway. An officer said the snow is blowing around so badly, the drivers could
###77 only see about five feet in front of their cars. Blizzard warnings were up yesterday
###81 in Iowa, also in parts of Nebraska, Missouri, Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin. Parts of
###87 Wisconsin had already seen up to seven inches of snow by yesterday morning. Predictions
###91 said another foot could be on the way.
###94 You`ve heard us talk a lot about the fiscal cliff, it`s a serious of automatic government
###100 spending cuts and tax increases that`s scheduled to take place at the beginning of the year.
###104 Now, President Obama and Congress can avoid this cliff by coming up with a compromise,
###109 a plan to lower the country`s debt. The president and Republican leaders have both offered some
###114 proposals on how to do this, but when we made this show Thursday evening, there wasn`t a
###118 deal. The members of the House and Senate said they`d stay in Washington to keep working
###122 on it, the deadline for a deal is January First. So make sure to check out cnn.com over
###128 the break for all the latest details.
###130 Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to all the students and teachers who watch our show around the
###136 globe. In what city will you find the world`s busiest airport? If you think you know it,
###141 shout it out! Is it London, New York, Tokyo or Atlanta? You`ve got three seconds, go.
###153 More planes take off inland at Atlanta`s Hartsfield Jackson Airport than any other airport in
###158 the world. That`s your answer, and that`s your "Shoutout."
###162 Whether it was by plane, train, automobile or ship, 2012 was a record breaking year for
###171 travel. According to the UNTO, the United Nations World Tourism Organization, more than
###176 a billion people traveled outside their countries this year.
###181 Richard Quest breaks down the numbers on where these travelers from, where they`re going
###184 to, and why that matters.
###186 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###187 RICHARD QUEST, HOST, `QUEST MEANS BUSINES": Where do they come and where do they go? First
###191 of all, where do tourists come from? 53 percent of international tourism, cross-border tourism
###196 is 53 percent from Europe, 22 percent Asia Pacific, 17 - well, you can see the numbers
###202 yourself. And those numbers obviously a lot of it is just literally crossing borders on
###210 short visits. It could be on business, it could be on vacations, it could be on government
###216 affairs, and where they go?
###219 So, again, most of it is Europe, a large part of it is Asia Pacific, the Americas and the
###225 Middle East. Obviously, Europe has a disproportionate amount. It`s because the people are going
###229 from one country to the next. The growing area, of course, is Asia Pacific. Now, why
###235 tourism matters? It`s really interesting. Nine percent of global GDP is said to be from
###242 tourism, look at the number of jobs, it says, look at the amount of exports, six percent
###246 of world trade, incidentally, this is all from the UNWTO itself. This is why they believe
###252 it matters.
