CHARLET DUBOC: Welcome to
Fashion Week International, a


4
0:0:8,135 --> 0:0:11,4
new show that reports on the
most fabulous fashion weeks in

the world and the culture and
politics behind them.

0:0:14,91 --> 0:0:17,4
This time we headed out
to the wild west


7
0:0:17,4 --> 0:0:19,363
of the east, Cambodia.

0:0:27,7 --> 0:0:29,68
CHARLET DUBOC: It's the crack
of dawn on the back of a


10
0:0:29,68 --> 0:0:33,18
cattle truck in the outskirts
of Phnom Penh.


11
0:0:33,18 --> 0:0:36,95
This is a typical daily commute
for the 400,000 female


12
0:0:36,95 --> 0:0:39,85
garment factory workers
of Cambodia.


13
0:0:39,85 --> 0:0:42,54
Despite the fact that the
garment industry represents


14
0:0:42,54 --> 0:0:46,78
80% of Cambodia's export
revenue, these girls work six


15
0:0:46,78 --> 0:0:51,21
days a week for only $2.00 a day
until, in some cases, they


16
0:0:51,21 --> 0:0:53,73
quite literally faint.


17
0:0:53,73 --> 0:0:58,102
We were here for the first ever
Cambodia fashion week,


18
0:0:58,102 --> 0:1:0,84
not that that meant anything
to the girls in the back of


19
0:1:0,84 --> 0:1:2,29
this truck.

23
0:1:18,37 --> 0:1:22,162



24
0:1:22,162 --> 0:1:25,2
CHARLET DUBOC: Cambodia used to
be a liberal, peace-loving


25
0:1:25,2 --> 0:1:27,82
country where miniskirt-clad
girls bopped to the


26
0:1:27,82 --> 0:1:30,2
sounds of psych pop.


27
0:1:30,2 --> 0:1:33,56
That was until Pol Pot's Khmer
Rouge not only destroyed the


28
0:1:33,56 --> 0:1:37,32
agricultural industry, but also
wiped out every Cambodian


29
0:1:37,32 --> 0:1:40,4
artist and intellectual, leading
to a creative brain


30
0:1:40,4 --> 0:1:44,98
drain that left a cultural
black hole until now.


31
0:1:44,98 --> 0:1:48,8
30 years on, the Cambodian
people are beginning to forge


32
0:1:48,8 --> 0:1:50,79
a creative path of their own.


33
0:1:50,79 --> 0:1:53,93
It was in this climate that the
country felt it was ready


34
0:1:53,93 --> 0:1:56,31
to host it's first ever
fashion week.


35
0:1:56,31 --> 0:2:0,594



36
0:2:0,594 --> 0:2:4,18
We're outside this art gallery
in downtown Phnom Penh with


37
0:2:4,18 --> 0:2:6,71

38
0:2:6,71 --> 0:2:10,35
And in there is the makings
of a fashion show by


39
0:2:10,35 --> 0:2:12,83
designer Don Prutasio.


40
0:2:12,83 --> 0:2:13,23

41
0:2:13,23 --> 0:2:14,1

DON PRUTASIO: From
the Philippines.

When you think about Cambodia,
you don't think


48
0:2:21,94 --> 0:2:23,8

49
0:2:23,8 --> 0:2:26,87
But Cambodia, there's a fashion
scene going on.


50
0:2:26,87 --> 0:2:28,43
It's not relevant
for the world.


51
0:2:28,43 --> 0:2:32,44

relevant enough.

mouths covered.

It's kind of like military.

they have to look stoned.

that pans out.

Prutasio's market was.

CHARLET DUBOC: The high classes
he was referring to


102
0:4:9,8 --> 0:4:12,87
are otherwise affectionately
known by the local press as


103
0:4:12,87 --> 0:4:16,76
the Khmer Riche, the sons and
daughters of rich and powerful


104
0:4:16,76 --> 0:4:18,279
government officials.


105
0:4:18,279 --> 0:4:20,93
As well as being fabulously
rich, they were also


106
0:4:20,93 --> 0:4:23,13
surprisingly camp.


107
0:4:23,13 --> 0:4:26,47
But not nearly as camp
as the after party.

expect something scary.

0:4:34,4 --> 0:4:37,1



113

The elite fashion crowd bailed,
and the vibe gave way


114

to a different form of creative
expression, appealing


115
0:4:42,71 --> 0:4:46,85
mainly to the white expats
in the mood for love.

CHARLET DUBOC: Having had our
first taste of fashion week,


129
0:6:22,83 --> 0:6:25,1
we were keen to look into the
other side of Cambodian


130
0:6:25,1 --> 0:6:27,63
fashion, the garment industry.


131
0:6:27,63 --> 0:6:30,99
We went to meet Phen Chou,
former garment worker and


132
0:6:30,99 --> 0:6:33,93

some of the recent issues


133

136
0:8:18,56 --> 0:8:20,16
CHARLET DUBOC: One of the
reasons we'd come to Phnom


137
0:8:20,16 --> 0:8:23,19
Penh was because we've read
stories in the local press of


138
0:8:23,19 --> 0:8:26,68
mass faintings in a garment
factory that produces clothes


139
0:8:26,68 --> 0:8:31,194
for international high
street brand, H&M.


140
0:8:31,194 --> 0:8:34,72
When the official report came
back, it claimed that the


141
0:8:34,72 --> 0:8:38,98
faintings were due to, wait
for it, evil spirits.


142
0:8:38,98 --> 0:8:44,77
Ghosts, not noxious fumes from
the dyes, but ghosts.


143
0:8:44,77 --> 0:8:48,95
To find out more, we met with Mu
Sochua, an opposition party


144

leader and campaigner
for worker's rights.


145
0:8:51,96 --> 0:8:56,62
MU SOCHUA: The garment sector,
it represents 80% of the


146
0:8:56,62 --> 0:8:59,86
export of Cambodia, billions
of dollars.


147
0:8:59,86 --> 0:9:6,35
It employs over 400,000 women
from remote villages in


148
0:9:6,35 --> 0:9:10,84
Cambodia, women who can
hardly read and write.


149
0:9:10,84 --> 0:9:13,47
They work in the hard
working conditions.


150
0:9:13,47 --> 0:9:15,8
They don't eat enough.


151
0:9:15,8 --> 0:9:16,79
Why are they fainting?


152
0:9:16,79 --> 0:9:19,36
Hundreds and thousands
fainting--


153
0:9:19,36 --> 0:9:21,77
When you're fired by the
factory, they don't


154
0:9:21,77 --> 0:9:23,14
want to go back home.


155
0:9:23,14 --> 0:9:27,34
They stay around the city, and
they take any job they can,


156
0:9:27,34 --> 0:9:28,91
even sex work.


157
0:9:28,91 --> 0:9:31,9
They cannot be working in these
factories for 10, 30


158
0:9:31,9 --> 0:9:33,33

That's the end of the road.

I don't think so.

pay a visit to one of many


162
0:9:39,5 --> 0:9:42,18

of the city.

0:9:42,18 --> 0:9:44,36

We're running because we want
to catch the garment workers


165

leaving the factory before
it's too late.


166

No one was willing to talk
outside the factory.

So we decided to try and hitch
a ride with a group of girls

good time in Cambodia?

CHARLET DUBOC: As Rina's models
paraded around and had

0:25:58,7 --> 0:26:2,564
DIY creations, we wondered why
more people like Rina hadn't

I wasn't off to a good start
and arrived late.

All the models were dressed
and ready to go.

than me squeezing into my

479
0:28:15,65 --> 0:28:17,87

0:28:19,875 --> 0:28:22,37
But to be honest, I was more
concerned about getting the

the end of the runway.

I opened the umbrella.

changed into my Sophy & Sina

She was surrounded by her
impenetrable entourage and

ushered out of the building the
moment we got too close.

However, we caught up with Remy,
whose rags to riches

0:29:17,21 --> 0:29:20,944

example of Cambodian fashion,

held captive.


502
0:29:28,8 --> 0:29:31,5
And we were escaping, like,
pitch dark at night.


503
0:29:31,5 --> 0:29:33,68
I don't know if they crawled
through barbed wires or


504
0:29:33,68 --> 0:29:35,21
running through bushes.

There was nothing particularly
wrong with the fashion week.

week should do,

But it happened in a cocoon.

Fashion weeks the world over
are inherently elitist.

But at the very least, the
general public in the West


522

knows what a fashion week is.

face, and lipstick.

Cambodia fashion week will
probably continue.

But as long as it's held in the
shadow of a society where

garment workers are beaten for
protesting, and mass faintings


530
0:30:32,82 --> 0:30:35,86

spirits, then it will
