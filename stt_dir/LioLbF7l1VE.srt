1
0:0:0,89 --> 0:0:3,88
it seems like iran has always been the
big bad


2
0:0:3,88 --> 0:0:6,52
but when it comes to north korea
everyone's like on


3
0:0:6,52 --> 0:0:9,3
that they have nuclear weapons and a
continued chance then


4
0:0:9,3 --> 0:0:13,66
but no one cares right so there's
there's a little bit of a acting when it


5
0:0:13,66 --> 0:0:17,18
comes to some politicians they pretend
to be a little concerned but when it


6
0:0:17,18 --> 0:0:22,26
comes to americans in general week i
don't make fun of north korea out we


7
0:0:22,26 --> 0:0:26,67
don't really see that as a real threat
at least not the moment but with iran


8
0:0:26,67 --> 0:0:30,14
there's always the sense of urgency all
my doctor building nuclear weapons we


9
0:0:30,14 --> 0:0:32,78
have to do something called i got the
uranium we gotta do something


10
0:0:32,78 --> 0:0:33,95
immediately


11
0:0:33,95 --> 0:0:34,72
so why


12
0:0:34,72 --> 0:0:38,2
is back in the atlantic did the job
breaking this down and i just cannot


13
0:0:38,2 --> 0:0:39,559
wait to discuss this


14
0:0:39,559 --> 0:0:43,789
so i just give you guys are uh... some
specific examples of


15
0:0:43,789 --> 0:0:47,49
how american politicians speak out about
iran but don't care much about north


16
0:0:47,49 --> 0:0:47,8
korea


17
0:0:47,8 --> 0:0:49,819
in defense secretary timetables


18
0:0:49,819 --> 0:0:53,569
full-day confirmation hearing before the
senate armed services committee but


19
0:0:53,569 --> 0:0:57,39
working robs mention one and one hundred
seventy times


20
0:0:57,39 --> 0:0:59,29
north transmission ten times


21
0:0:59,29 --> 0:1:3,72
now remember iraq doesn't have nuclear
weapons yet yeah north korean dots now


22
0:1:3,72 --> 0:1:7,29
of course that nuclear weapons that they
have or their nuclear capabilities and


23
0:1:7,29 --> 0:1:10,47
all that impressive at the moment hubble
we know that


24
0:1:10,47 --> 0:1:14,549
they have something that writing their
back to me brand but they do have them


25
0:1:14,549 --> 0:1:17,59
they do not have exactly i'm part of the
problem


26
0:1:17,59 --> 0:1:19,52
underwent distribuidora for it


27
0:1:19,52 --> 0:1:23,45
double legacy firstly as the the
tensions between us and and uh... in


28
0:1:23,45 --> 0:1:26,47
north korea also between north korea
south korean all that from the ratchet


29
0:1:26,47 --> 0:1:28,57
up in the past few weeks let me know


30
0:1:28,57 --> 0:1:32,88
at least of if read it is representative
but it's just it's just jokes like he


31
0:1:32,88 --> 0:1:36,88
did on the main show couple days ago you
did the picture of uh...


32
0:1:36,88 --> 0:1:38,93
uh... pins on uh...


33
0:1:38,93 --> 0:1:42,14
your own with the the pig nose and
everything like yes it just seems so


34
0:1:42,14 --> 0:1:43,34
easy to market


35
0:1:43,34 --> 0:1:46,299
and it's because their culture is a
little bit more foreign obviously


36
0:1:46,299 --> 0:1:49,53
they're their leaders are fit in such a
different position than that they have a


37
0:1:49,53 --> 0:1:52,97
rich person it's easy to mark the lights
also before we get into like asian


38
0:1:52,97 --> 0:1:56,33
stereotypes because that's actually part
of this and i knew that it would be part


39
0:1:56,33 --> 0:1:58,439
of this let's discuss uh...


40
0:1:58,439 --> 0:2:1,259
here's some of the real issues with the
wind


41
0:2:1,259 --> 0:2:5,489
love this explanation thing it's the
best one so far with iran you'll have


42
0:2:5,489 --> 0:2:8,979
religious martyrs right so when you talk
about nuclear war


43
0:2:8,979 --> 0:2:13,309
a lot of countries that have nuclear
weapons will not engage in nuclear war


44
0:2:13,309 --> 0:2:16,73
because they know that that will be the
demise of their own country


45
0:2:16,73 --> 0:2:20,0
offer instead of someone tax the united
states of the nuclear weapon when you


46
0:2:20,0 --> 0:2:22,709
think the united states is going to
bring in attacking you


47
0:2:22,709 --> 0:2:27,159
which our nuclear weapons so what you're
on there more religious martyrs that


48
0:2:27,159 --> 0:2:28,31
might be


49
0:2:28,31 --> 0:2:32,489
willing to die in the name of the
original in the name of their country


50
0:2:32,489 --> 0:2:35,749
with north korea they care much more
about their state


51
0:2:35,749 --> 0:2:40,169
as opposed to anything else or or making
sure to preserve their stay


52
0:2:40,169 --> 0:2:42,859
and you all know that there are three
has been threatening us for a very long


53
0:2:42,859 --> 0:2:45,339
time this is not some new development


54
0:2:45,339 --> 0:2:49,909
so i love that explanation but then they
also i kind of delved into on


55
0:2:49,909 --> 0:2:55,149
stereotypes so when it comes to moslems
of course the stereotype is they're more


56
0:2:55,149 --> 0:2:57,879
danger as al you know that there is a


57
0:2:57,879 --> 0:3:2,219
and bill engaging riskier behavior
whereas with occasions there seem isn't


58
0:3:2,219 --> 0:3:6,799
seen as worked in a and people don't
generally think of them as a threat


59
0:3:6,799 --> 0:3:10,3
about sacred belief that by any way
shape or form but you know that's


60
0:3:10,3 --> 0:3:13,72
just in general thinking behind it and i
thought was interesting headed to some


61
0:3:13,72 --> 0:3:17,38
extent that's reflected in in popular
culture like you see that who's the bad


62
0:3:17,38 --> 0:3:20,679
guy in the action movies changes over
time infor


63
0:3:20,679 --> 0:3:23,939
herb the last fifteen years or so it's
usually been muslims of some stripper


64
0:3:23,939 --> 0:3:25,95
data from one country doesn't matter
which


65
0:3:25,95 --> 0:3:29,6
sometimes they're made up countries they
will typically be the villain whereas


66
0:3:29,6 --> 0:3:32,2
north korea like they were one of the
bond movies like it never dipping down


67
0:3:32,2 --> 0:3:36,6
that and i don't know if that causes
some of what leads to us to fear around


68
0:3:36,6 --> 0:3:38,89
more than north korea or if it's simply
a reflection of it


69
0:3:38,89 --> 0:3:40,709
but that's going on to the popular
culture


70
0:3:40,709 --> 0:3:45,379
and also you know i keep in mind that we
have the influence of israel israel is


71
0:3:45,379 --> 0:3:49,519
that you know very much willie are
n_b_c_ claim that they're willing to


72
0:3:49,519 --> 0:3:50,89
that


73
0:3:50,89 --> 0:3:54,469
anti-tax iran if they do see iran is a
threat and how many times as net neon


74
0:3:54,469 --> 0:3:55,239
set


75
0:3:55,239 --> 0:3:57,239
we're going to go in with an attack iran


76
0:3:57,239 --> 0:4:0,209
so that kind of makes the situation in
iran a lot


77
0:4:0,209 --> 0:4:1,359
shakir


78
0:4:1,359 --> 0:4:6,369
uh... but another thing is and i i
didn't know this story to recently


79
0:4:6,369 --> 0:4:10,359
north korea out that the state media
north korea had reported that they found


80
0:4:10,359 --> 0:4:12,319
a unicorn lair


81
0:4:12,319 --> 0:4:16,519
uncovered that look if you're probably
the first hour but if your


82
0:4:16,519 --> 0:4:21,56
it's telling your people that you
discovered a unicorn layer


83
0:4:21,56 --> 0:4:24,87
you know if you're threatening us with
nuclear weapons newman's contingency


84
0:4:24,87 --> 0:4:28,949
ears i don't even know if that's the
craziest thing like he's only ever board


85
0:4:28,949 --> 0:4:32,789
three hundred any invented oral sex like
there's a lot of crazy things that you


86
0:4:32,789 --> 0:4:41,74
know they do but if you're in for you


87
0:4:41,74 --> 0:4:44,55
but i think that you did touch on the
biggest one like they've been listening


88
0:4:44,55 --> 0:4:48,189
this atlantic p several reasons that we
fear run more than north korea but i


89
0:4:48,189 --> 0:4:50,36
think they israel's the most important
part


90
0:4:50,36 --> 0:4:54,419
visiting like cuba real the average
american who does not care much about


91
0:4:54,419 --> 0:4:59,12
any country in the world cares about
america and israel and in both of these


92
0:4:59,12 --> 0:5:2,139
cases the country that we could
potentially fear has a hostage to some


93
0:5:2,139 --> 0:5:6,38
extent iran has israel's hostage north
korea even more directly as south korea


94
0:5:6,38 --> 0:5:10,389
as a hostage and that the average
american for whatever reason just does


95
0:5:10,389 --> 0:5:15,22
not feel any connection to south korea
for some raised the specter in in at


96
0:5:15,22 --> 0:5:18,619
incredible growth of u_n_ job
christianity in south korea recently


97
0:5:18,619 --> 0:7:18,619
uh... i think that they just care more
about israel
