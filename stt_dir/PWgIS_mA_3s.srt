1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,486



2
0:0:3,486 --> 0:0:7,968
SARAH KRATHEN: We fell
in love pretty quick.


3
0:0:7,968 --> 0:0:9,462
Friend love.


4
0:0:9,462 --> 0:0:12,45
Family love.


5
0:0:12,45 --> 0:0:14,94
I want to clarify once and for
all, there's been no other


6
0:0:14,94 --> 0:0:16,416
kind of love.


7
0:0:16,416 --> 0:0:19,35
EMMA HEARST: Heterosexual
life mates.


8
0:0:19,35 --> 0:0:20,81
SARAH KRATHEN: That's going
to be our corporate name.


9
0:0:20,81 --> 0:0:22,56
EMMA HEARST: People used to
think we were homosexual life


10
0:0:22,56 --> 0:0:24,525
mates, but we're not.


11
0:0:24,525 --> 0:0:26,8
SARAH KRATHEN: Yeah, which Emma
thought was hilarious


12
0:0:26,8 --> 0:0:29,5
when we were building Sorella,
because she had a boyfriend.


13
0:0:29,5 --> 0:0:31,538
And I was just like this
single lesbian


14
0:0:31,538 --> 0:0:32,788
in love with her.


15
0:0:32,788 --> 0:0:49,43



16
0:0:49,43 --> 0:0:51,28
EMMA HEARST: My name
is Emma Hearst.


17
0:0:51,28 --> 0:0:52,94
And I'm the co-owner
of Sorella in


18
0:0:52,94 --> 0:0:54,78
the Lower East Side.


19
0:0:54,78 --> 0:0:56,26
My business partner
and co-owner of


20
0:0:56,26 --> 0:0:57,49
Sorella is Sarah Krathen.


21
0:0:57,49 --> 0:1:0,345
And she does the entire beverage
program and all the


22
0:1:0,345 --> 0:1:1,525
front of the house.


23
0:1:1,525 --> 0:1:4,18
Sarah and I met in
culinary school.


24
0:1:4,18 --> 0:1:7,4
We signed a lease here
when I was 21.


25
0:1:7,4 --> 0:1:10,29
And it's been almost
four years.


26
0:1:10,29 --> 0:1:12,97
Age has been a factor since
we've opened here.


27
0:1:12,97 --> 0:1:15,28
Everybody told us, don't
open up in New York.


28
0:1:15,28 --> 0:1:17,4
You're not ready to go play
with the big boys.


29
0:1:17,4 --> 0:1:19,53
We were like, fuck it.


30
0:1:19,53 --> 0:1:23,12
We focus here on a region of
Italy known as Piedmont.


31
0:1:23,12 --> 0:1:24,87
Lots of good stuff
comes from there.


32
0:1:24,87 --> 0:1:28,97
Most people relate it with
truffles and Barolo wine.


33
0:1:28,97 --> 0:1:35,34
These are little pastas called
Agnolotti del Plin.


34
0:1:35,34 --> 0:1:37,87
And they're only found
in Piedmont.


35
0:1:37,87 --> 0:1:39,89
It means little pinched
pillows.


36
0:1:39,89 --> 0:1:43,1
They're filled with a red wine
braised short rib that's mixed


37
0:1:43,1 --> 0:1:46,31
with a little bit of cabbage
and shallots and lemon zest


38
0:1:46,31 --> 0:1:48,96
and a hint of nutmeg.


39
0:1:48,96 --> 0:1:52,59
We definitely like to deviate
from Piedmont as well.


40
0:1:52,59 --> 0:1:55,83
Our dish that is definitely not
Piedmontese in any sense


41
0:1:55,83 --> 0:1:58,67
of the form would be our
broccoli fritto.


42
0:1:58,67 --> 0:2:0,83
So we're taking this broccoli
and putting it


43
0:2:0,83 --> 0:2:2,48
in rice flour batter.


44
0:2:2,48 --> 0:2:5,8
It goes into our fryer.


45
0:2:5,8 --> 0:2:7,74
And then when we pull it out, it
gets tossed in a little bit


46
0:2:7,74 --> 0:2:12,296
of salt and then topped with
a pickled hot pepper aioli,


47
0:2:12,296 --> 0:2:16,29
basil, and Grana
Padano cheese.


48
0:2:16,29 --> 0:2:19,11
It came on as a special,
originally, and then it just


49
0:2:19,11 --> 0:2:20,65
never came off.


50
0:2:20,65 --> 0:2:22,85
It's always fun to watch people
eat this dish for the


51
0:2:22,85 --> 0:2:29,12
first time, because their faces
are, like, blown away.


52
0:2:29,12 --> 0:2:32,57
My pastry chef is
Yarisis Jacobo.


53
0:2:32,57 --> 0:2:36,48
The reason why Yarisis and my
food work so well together is


54
0:2:36,48 --> 0:2:40,19
because she's such a fan of
contrasting textures and sweet


55
0:2:40,19 --> 0:2:44,46
and salty, as am I. And it
should be like an explosion


56
0:2:44,46 --> 0:2:46,48
every time something
hits your mouth.


57
0:2:46,48 --> 0:2:50,92
Yarisis's desserts are
absolutely exquisite.


58
0:2:50,92 --> 0:2:53,845
And people come here just
for dessert, too.


59
0:2:53,845 --> 0:2:57,41
Our mentality in here is to
make things like little


60
0:2:57,41 --> 0:2:59,11
Italian grandmothers.


61
0:2:59,11 --> 0:3:2,25
The most awesome thing about
Sorella, in my opinion, is


62
0:3:2,25 --> 0:3:5,7
that I get to work with my
best friends every day.


63
0:3:5,7 --> 0:3:8,394
And I couldn't ask for anything
more than that.


64
0:3:8,394 --> 0:3:10,754
YARISIS JACOBO: Yeah, everyone
knows each other, hangs out


65
0:3:10,754 --> 0:3:11,84
together all the time.


66
0:3:11,84 --> 0:3:13,4
It's a very friendly
environment.


67
0:3:13,4 --> 0:3:13,92
EMMA HEARST: When we're
not working,


68
0:3:13,92 --> 0:3:16,81
we're drinking together.


69
0:3:16,81 --> 0:3:18,53
Family that plays together
stays together.


70
0:3:18,53 --> 0:3:21,86
And we not only drink
when we leave work.


71
0:3:21,86 --> 0:3:25,2
We also drink during work,
especially Sarah and I,


72
0:3:25,2 --> 0:3:26,46
especially on stressful days.


73
0:3:26,46 --> 0:3:29,226
But everything in moderation.


74
0:3:29,226 --> 0:3:30,218
SARAH KRATHEN: Shall we?


75
0:3:30,218 --> 0:3:34,186
EMMA HEARST: Let's blow
this popsicle stand.


76
0:3:34,186 --> 0:3:35,436
Margarita time.


77
0:3:35,436 --> 0:3:39,16



78
0:3:39,16 --> 0:3:42,7
So we're headed to
Mesa Coyoacan in


79
0:3:42,7 --> 0:3:44,23
Williamsburg, Brooklyn.


80
0:3:44,23 --> 0:3:47,376
And we are going to go get
sauced on some margaritas.


81
0:3:47,376 --> 0:3:50,53
SARAH KRATHEN: I am so specific
about a margarita.


82
0:3:50,53 --> 0:3:52,89
Want the fresh ice, always.


83
0:3:52,89 --> 0:3:53,87
Shaken and then strained
into fresh ice


84
0:3:53,87 --> 0:3:55,9
is the biggest thing.


85
0:3:55,9 --> 0:3:56,91
Fresh juice.


86
0:3:56,91 --> 0:3:57,8
EMMA HEARST: Good tequila.


87
0:3:57,8 --> 0:3:58,62
SARAH KRATHEN: Never
taste sweet.


88
0:3:58,62 --> 0:4:0,27
Good tequila is key.


89
0:4:0,27 --> 0:4:1,56
I don't want all salt.


90
0:4:1,56 --> 0:4:2,2
I want half salt.


91
0:4:2,2 --> 0:4:4,29
I want the option.


92
0:4:4,29 --> 0:4:6,66
I love margaritas.


93
0:4:6,66 --> 0:4:8,96
EMMA HEARST: I wonder what Ivan
and Gerardo are going to


94
0:4:8,96 --> 0:4:10,68
be cooking up tonight.


95
0:4:10,68 --> 0:4:11,14
All right.


96
0:4:11,14 --> 0:4:14,36
Here we are.


97
0:4:14,36 --> 0:4:15,61
Let's go get our drink on.


98
0:4:15,61 --> 0:4:25,37



99
0:4:25,37 --> 0:4:26,338
How are you, chef?


100
0:4:26,338 --> 0:4:27,306
IVAN GARCIA: How are you?


101
0:4:27,306 --> 0:4:28,63
EMMA HEARST: Good.


102
0:4:28,63 --> 0:4:28,98
Hi!


103
0:4:28,98 --> 0:4:31,32
GERARDO ZABALETAVE:
How are you?


104
0:4:31,32 --> 0:4:34,29
EMMA HEARST: My friends,
Gerardo and Ivan, they


105
0:4:34,29 --> 0:4:37,57
actually found Sorella, the
space that we're in.


106
0:4:37,57 --> 0:4:40,8
We met them about
six years ago.


107
0:4:40,8 --> 0:4:43,362
And we've remained
close friends.


108
0:4:43,362 --> 0:4:46,278
We're going to get
some margaritas.


109
0:4:46,278 --> 0:4:48,222
Half salt.


110
0:4:48,222 --> 0:4:51,624
SARAH KRATHEN: Not too sweet.


111
0:4:51,624 --> 0:4:52,94
EMMA HEARST: Cheers.


112
0:4:52,94 --> 0:4:53,32
Bottoms up.


113
0:4:53,32 --> 0:4:54,0
SARAH KRATHEN: Cheers.


114
0:4:54,0 --> 0:4:55,792
Cheers.


115
0:4:55,792 --> 0:4:59,14
EMMA HEARST: I wish yellow
Gatorade tasted like this.


116
0:4:59,14 --> 0:5:1,4
I would drink it all the time.


117
0:5:1,4 --> 0:5:3,63
I would just drink it while
I was working out.


118
0:5:3,63 --> 0:5:6,42
But it had all the same benefits
as Gatorade, like


119
0:5:6,42 --> 0:5:7,67
margaritas with electrolytes.


120
0:5:7,67 --> 0:5:9,632



121
0:5:9,632 --> 0:5:10,614
-Cazadores Blanco.


122
0:5:10,614 --> 0:5:12,87
EMMA HEARST: Oh, hey now!


123
0:5:12,87 --> 0:5:15,33



124
0:5:15,33 --> 0:5:16,35
-Are you ladies set to order?


125
0:5:16,35 --> 0:5:17,19
Do you know what you want?


126
0:5:17,19 --> 0:5:18,25
EMMA HEARST: Yeah.


127
0:5:18,25 --> 0:5:24,31
Some guacamole, the shrimp
ceviche, the cochinita tacos,


128
0:5:24,31 --> 0:5:25,57
and the pescado tacos.


129
0:5:25,57 --> 0:5:27,138
-The shrimp tacos?


130
0:5:27,138 --> 0:5:28,62
EMMA HEARST: The fish tacos.


131
0:5:28,62 --> 0:5:29,114
-The fish tacos?


132
0:5:29,114 --> 0:5:31,584
EMMA HEARST: Yeah, and then
the special, and the


133
0:5:31,584 --> 0:5:32,78
cochinita.


134
0:5:32,78 --> 0:5:32,572
-And the cochinita.


135
0:5:32,572 --> 0:5:33,56
EMMA HEARST: Yeah.


136
0:5:33,56 --> 0:5:34,81
And ceviche-- shrimp ceviche.


137
0:5:34,81 --> 0:5:37,512



138
0:5:37,512 --> 0:5:39,982
SARAH KRATHEN: After we do this,
we won't even remember


139
0:5:39,982 --> 0:5:40,97
what we ordered anyway.


140
0:5:40,97 --> 0:5:42,452
You're winning.


141
0:5:42,452 --> 0:5:44,428
Here's to the last thing
we remember tonight.


142
0:5:44,428 --> 0:5:51,838



143
0:5:51,838 --> 0:5:53,82
EMMA HEARST: Yum!


144
0:5:53,82 --> 0:5:56,92
We can always rely on them for
really tasty, homemade,


145
0:5:56,92 --> 0:6:0,34
delicious Mexican food.


146
0:6:0,34 --> 0:6:2,93
IVAN GARCIA: This
is mole poblano.


147
0:6:2,93 --> 0:6:5,6
It's one of my favorite
dishes here.


148
0:6:5,6 --> 0:6:8,69
This is a secret recipe
from my grandmom.


149
0:6:8,69 --> 0:6:12,1
It's a little hard to make mole,
because we need only


150
0:6:12,1 --> 0:6:16,32
five ingredients to make a
real and delicious mole.


151
0:6:16,32 --> 0:6:19,7
One of the important ingredients
is the chiles.


152
0:6:19,7 --> 0:6:23,25
We use four different
kinds of chiles.


153
0:6:23,25 --> 0:6:24,74
Mexican chocolate--


154
0:6:24,74 --> 0:6:27,6
this is very important for the
recipe, Chocolate Abuelita.


155
0:6:27,6 --> 0:6:36,632



156
0:6:36,632 --> 0:6:39,112
EMMA HEARST: Wow, this
stuff looks great.


157
0:6:39,112 --> 0:6:41,96
It smells fantastic.


158
0:6:41,96 --> 0:6:42,584
SARAH KRATHEN: It's
so flavorful.


159
0:6:42,584 --> 0:6:43,576
EMMA HEARST: Yeah.


160
0:6:43,576 --> 0:6:46,48
That's my favorite mole
in the city, for sure.


161
0:6:46,48 --> 0:6:48,2
It's so good.


162
0:6:48,2 --> 0:6:48,91
-Cheers.


163
0:6:48,91 --> 0:6:49,49
EMMA HEARST: Cheers.


164
0:6:49,49 --> 0:6:51,97
Thank you so much
for having us.


165
0:6:51,97 --> 0:6:52,96
SARAH KRATHEN: Thank
you for having us.


166
0:6:52,96 --> 0:6:53,455
-Thanks for coming.


167
0:6:53,455 --> 0:6:54,445
SARAH KRATHEN: It's so
nice to be here.


168
0:6:54,445 --> 0:6:54,94
-Anytime.


169
0:6:54,94 --> 0:6:55,93
EMMA HEARST: It's always
good to be here.


170
0:6:55,93 --> 0:6:56,425
-Anytime.


171
0:6:56,425 --> 0:6:58,42
EMMA HEARST: Well, that
was an excellent meal.


172
0:6:58,42 --> 0:7:1,0



173
0:7:1,0 --> 0:7:3,78
Well, after Mesa Coyoacan, we
were open here at Sorella


174
0:7:3,78 --> 0:7:4,35
until 2:00 AM.


175
0:7:4,35 --> 0:7:7,38
So of course, we all came
back here for dessert.


176
0:7:7,38 --> 0:7:8,165
What else?


177
0:7:8,165 --> 0:7:9,54
YARISIS JACOBO: We
should have--


178
0:7:9,54 --> 0:7:10,692
SARAH KRATHEN: Bomboloni.


179
0:7:10,692 --> 0:7:13,2
YARISIS JACOBO: Little
bomboloni, a little bit of


180
0:7:13,2 --> 0:7:17,35
coconut stracciatella,
some biscotti gelati.


181
0:7:17,35 --> 0:7:18,62
EMMA HEARST: Sure. chunky.


182
0:7:18,62 --> 0:7:19,21
YARISIS JACOBO: Chunky.


183
0:7:19,21 --> 0:7:21,29
EMMA HEARST: We should just
have all the gelato.


184
0:7:21,29 --> 0:7:22,347
YARISIS JACOBO: Maybe we should
just have a little bit


185
0:7:22,347 --> 0:7:24,5
of everything.


186
0:7:24,5 --> 0:7:25,85
EMMA HEARST: Probably.


187
0:7:25,85 --> 0:7:27,1
Did anyone bring a joint?


188
0:7:27,1 --> 0:7:30,75



189
0:7:30,75 --> 0:7:33,43
I think the desserts here are
definitely a great late-night


190
0:7:33,43 --> 0:7:37,56
snack, because they do encompass
all the savory and


191
0:7:37,56 --> 0:7:41,105
sweet components into one that
you would get eating chocolate


192
0:7:41,105 --> 0:7:43,66
and potato chips.


193
0:7:43,66 --> 0:7:45,79
Our bomboloni are definitely
a crowd pleaser.


194
0:7:45,79 --> 0:7:49,78
They are little Italian fried
donuts with a filling that


195
0:7:49,78 --> 0:7:51,83
changes seasonally.


196
0:7:51,83 --> 0:7:53,16
What's the filling right now?


197
0:7:53,16 --> 0:7:55,17
YARISIS JACOBO: Peanut
butter caramel.


198
0:7:55,17 --> 0:7:57,71
EMMA HEARST: And then we also
serve just traditional glazed


199
0:7:57,71 --> 0:8:1,684
ones that are like Krispy
Kreme donuts on crack.


200
0:8:1,684 --> 0:8:2,636
Hi, Isaac.


201
0:8:2,636 --> 0:8:4,54
YARISIS JACOBO: Hi, Isaac.


202
0:8:4,54 --> 0:8:6,92
EMMA HEARST: Isaac's going to
go steal our bomboloni.


203
0:8:6,92 --> 0:8:8,824
-He's a little monster.


204
0:8:8,824 --> 0:8:14,165
YARISIS JACOBO: This is challah
bread with a pistachio


205
0:8:14,165 --> 0:8:19,9
black pepper toffee that's
swirled into it and then


206
0:8:19,9 --> 0:8:21,64
seared in brown butter.


207
0:8:21,64 --> 0:8:24,931
And then it's filled with
vanilla pastry cream and


208
0:8:24,931 --> 0:8:27,484
served with lemon curd.


209
0:8:27,484 --> 0:8:30,97
And then I think we just need
some gelato to finish this up.


210
0:8:30,97 --> 0:8:33,21
EMMA HEARST: Our gelatos
are very popular here.


211
0:8:33,21 --> 0:8:37,53
Our gelatos are traditional
Italian flavors that have


212
0:8:37,53 --> 0:8:40,764
collided with American
stoner influence.


213
0:8:40,764 --> 0:8:43,38
It's like Ben & Jerry's
but better.


214
0:8:43,38 --> 0:8:46,493
YARISIS JACOBO: This is
our Chunky Sorella.


215
0:8:46,493 --> 0:8:51,12
But we are kind of known for
salted caramel gelato with a


216
0:8:51,12 --> 0:8:55,25
chocolate ganache swirl
and chocolate covered.


217
0:8:55,25 --> 0:8:56,34
EMMA HEARST: Some good stuff.


218
0:8:56,34 --> 0:8:57,56
See this right here?


219
0:8:57,56 --> 0:8:59,432
This is quality.


220
0:8:59,432 --> 0:9:3,87
This is the reason that
my thighs hate me.


221
0:9:3,87 --> 0:9:4,85
YARISIS JACOBO: Beautiful
gelato--


222
0:9:4,85 --> 0:9:5,846
EMMA HEARST: Oh yeah.


223
0:9:5,846 --> 0:9:7,96
YARISIS JACOBO: And sorbets.


224
0:9:7,96 --> 0:9:16,802



225
0:9:16,802 --> 0:9:18,296
EMMA HEARST: Oh my
god, I forgot how


226
0:9:18,296 --> 0:9:19,79
fucking good that is.


227
0:9:19,79 --> 0:9:24,23



228
0:9:24,23 --> 0:9:25,51
-Emma, this mango is dope.


229
0:9:25,51 --> 0:9:26,746
EMMA HEARST: Isn't it?


230
0:9:26,746 --> 0:9:30,57
-Good job.


231
0:9:30,57 --> 0:9:32,9
EMMA HEARST: I think working
in restaurants, it's


232
0:9:32,9 --> 0:9:35,36
definitely a high stress
environment.


233
0:9:35,36 --> 0:9:39,37
And you are constantly serving
other people and at other


234
0:9:39,37 --> 0:9:40,59
people's beck and call.


235
0:9:40,59 --> 0:9:43,8
So yes, everybody needs
their time to blow off


236
0:9:43,8 --> 0:9:45,69
steam and have fun.


237
0:9:45,69 --> 0:9:48,85
We are very good friends,
all of us here.


238
0:9:48,85 --> 0:9:50,6
They are some of my
best friends.


239
0:9:50,6 --> 0:9:51,183
It's been a lot of fun.


240
0:9:51,183 --> 0:9:52,83
And it's like our home.


241
0:9:52,83 --> 0:9:54,8
It's our house.


242
0:9:54,8 --> 0:11:54,8
