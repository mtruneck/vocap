###220 Judd, you can't.
###223 I got to get in the house.
###225 Poke your head out in the clear, and a Falin will get you.
###229 But Melissa, she's going to have a baby.
###253 Hit you, David?
###254 No Falin can ever get me, Uncle Judd.
###285 Oh, God, give her the strength to be good,
###290 to be never hateful and never fight.
###296 And don't let her carry the burden of fear,
###299 watching her loved ones and seeing them die.
###305 Always asking out of her heart,
###309 "Why has it got to be? Why has it got to be?"
###340 <i>When it's twilight</i> <i>on the trail</i>
###347 <i>And I jog along</i>
###350 <i>The world is like a dream</i>
###353 <i>And the ripple of the stream</i> <i>is my song</i>
###359 <i>When it's twilight</i> <i>on the trail</i>
###365 <i>And I rest once more</i>
###368 <i>My ceiling is the sky</i>
###371 <i>And the grass on which I lie</i> <i>is my floor</i>
###377 <i>Never ever</i> <i>have a nickel</i> <i>in my jeans</i>
###383 <i>Never ever</i> <i>have a debt to pay</i>
###389 <i>Still I understand</i> <i>what real contentment means</i>
###395 <i>Guess I was born that way</i>
###401 <i>When it's twilight</i> <i>on the trail</i>
###407 <i>And my voice is still</i>
###411 <i>Please plant</i> <i>this heart of mine</i>
###415 <i>Underneath</i> <i>the Lonesome Pine</i> <i>on the hill</i>
###422 And I says to him, I says, "Look here, Zeke Denker,
###424 "you're driving your hogs to mighty poor swill."
###426 Bet that buttoned him. Not Zeke.
###428 He's the laughingest man I ever met. Nothing bites him.
###431 Laughs when it's clever enough to rain.
###433 Laughs when the sun shines.
###434 He looks me right in the eye...
###438 Dave's better.
###439 Is he? Yep.
###442 Perking up a mite. Arm's a little green
###445 but I stuck a chaw of tobaccy on it.
###448 Cold rifle barrel will do it more good.
###450 What he have to say? About the Falins I mean.
###453 "Eat your sow belly and get for home." That's what he said.
###456 Said, "Ain't gonna be no fighting till I can tote a gun."
###459 And I come six miles.
###460 Six miles.
###461 I can throw a clump of dogwood that far.
###463 I'm nigh on to 30 miles. Look. Look.
###468 Gather around now. Gather around.
###470 I'm really going to show you something now.
###472 Maybe we's will get a go at the kid.
###475 Whenever Judd Tolliver gets an itch to plug the Falins,
###479 he starts playing with the young ones.
###483 I'm gonna be the human hub.
###485 Now, Willie, you go down there and stop me if I get to going too fast.
###493 Lizzie Bee, you better go down and help Willie.
###498 Look out now, here I come. Don't forget to stop me.
###511 Well, why didn't you stop me?
###521 Judd's better than that wagon show we saw once.
###532 Melissa, you got a bellyache or something?
###537 Just thinking, Lina.
###538 Sakes and sassafras!
###540 Thinking boils the pot over.
###542 It boils over and over and over if you ain't thinking.
###547 Killing. All the time killing.
###551 They are planning it now. They done it yesterday,
###553 and the week before, and the year before that.
###556 Ever since I was a little child they done it.
###559 Kill a Falin. Kill a Falin.
###561 That's all they could say.
###563 Plowing, splitting reins. Filling the corn crib.
###566 Kill a Falin! And the echo comes back to us from over the hills.
###570 Kill a Tolliver. Kill. Kill. Why?
###575 Melissa!
###582 What you biting your paws about, Auntie?
###585 Worrying, I guess, June and Buddie ain't back yet.
###587 Where they be?
###589 Over at the yard doctor, getting a potion for you.
###597 Is that the way you like it?
###603 Just right.
###604 You should have let me get a town doctor, Dave.
###607 It don't look right. It's too swole up.
###610 You're awfully good to me, Auntie.
###611 You're a good boy, Dave.
###613 Your boy.
###615 My boy.
###616 Sometimes I wished I was, Auntie. Then I wished I wasn't
###618 'cause if I was, I couldn't marry June and if I wasn't...
###623 Relations like we ones got me all thicked up.
###625 Cousins are always thicker than fleas in the mountains, Dave.
###630 I'm a big, big black bear.
###635 I'm a mean black bear.
###642 I'm getting closer. I'll get you.
###654 I'm coming closer.
###670 You laugh at me, foreigner, and I'll... I'll...
###674 I don't blame you, I'd do the same thing myself.
###687 That was funny. Why didn't you laugh?
###690 She's one of the Tollivers.
###691 That's still funny.
###692 She didn't think so.
###694 That's a woman's privilege.
###695 Now, where were we?
###696 Right in the middle of that fault, over there.
###698 Yeah.
###699 Two years supply of strip-coal before we have to drift mine it.
###702 We'll steam-shovel the top coal
###703 and make it pay for the railroad up here.
###706 You haven't got it yet.
###707 No.
###708 Well, suppose you let me worry about that.
###710 The right and title to that privilege is yours, my friend.
###714 You got that privilege this very minute.
###716 Start using it.
###723 I was just running in that wood,
###724 and I heard she was a bear.
###726 And when I looked around to see if she
###728 was going to eat me, she was gone.
###730 Maybe she ate herself and disappeared.
###732 Judd Tolliver, how you talk.
###735 Child. Child. You mustn't.
###738 Juny's coming back.
###740 Maybe she stopped down by the river.
###751 Looks like she fetched the river with her.
###753 June!
###755 Well, I brung it, didn't I?
###756 June, if you ain't the lookingest...
###758 I've been running across that log
###759 ever since I was knee high to a grasshopper.
###761 I can catch a squirrel on it with one hand,
###764 but when that dog see that foreigner...
###765 Foreigner?
###767 He stopped right smack-dab in the middle of the log and I tripped.
###770 What was the foreigner doing?
###771 Don't know. Wasn't looking.
###773 Before you know it, there I go. Plunk, right down.
###776 What did he look like?
###777 Just had a squint.
###778 He's about so tall, about that wide.
###783 Was all dressed in brown, even his hat.
###785 And his coat had a belt.
###787 Just a squint?
###789 Dave Tolliver, if you're thinking
###790 what I'm a thinking, I'm going to tell you off.
###792 Go down to the creek and wash your dirty face.
###794 For two carrot seeds, I'd rub it all over you.
###796 You do it, and I'll spank you where it hurts.
###799 You will, will you?
###804 Did that hurt?
###807 How could it?
###809 Oh!
###813 I've been talking to your pappy.
###815 We's going to get married.
###819 When? Hog killing time.
###821 Your pappy has invited all the Tollivers.
###822 The whole kit and boodle of them.
###824 I ain't marrying till green up.
###826 Spring's always the time to do them things.
###828 Then it'll be next green up and the next.
###832 I don't feel nothing.
###835 Like... What do you mean?
###839 I don't know.
###844 Come on. Come on.
###847 Dinner.
###849 Come on.
###852 Better make it just a dipping, June, or them
###853 hungry mouths will eat that table bare.
###856 Ma. Come here.
###862 Ma. Do I...
###866 Do I like Dave?
###868 Why, honey, I think you do.
###872 Like you like Pappy?
###877 Well, you remember when Dave went to Pokey Wells,
###884 you was a-grieving for him then, weren't you?
###887 And when he's to home, he don't make no nevermind to you?
###891 But, Ma... Melissa,
###893 the folks are waiting for their dinner.
###894 Coming.
###896 Well, that's liking, honey.
###977 This here man wants to talk to you, Judd.
###980 Does, huh?
###981 My name is Hale, Jack Hale.
###985 I wonder if I could see you alone.
###987 Here's all right.
###989 Well, I...
###992 You see, I wanted to talk to you about coal.
###998 The coal on your property, I mean.
###1000 You know what I mean? The fault down about a mile.
###1003 Well, you've seen the coal. You know what I mean.
###1005 The fault. The Alton people, I'm with them and they...
###1011 You was talking about coal.
###1013 Oh, yes. Coal.
###1014 There'll be a railroad up along the Ticopi
###1015 and then down across the ridge to your place.
###1017 Who said there would?
###1018 I mean, of course, if it's agreeable with
###1020 the contracting parties, like yourself.
###1022 The thing will make you rich. There's no doubt about that.
###1024 And if we can make a deal...
###1026 Who's the others?
###1028 The contract with you is for the coal.
###1030 Who is the others?
###1032 Well, there's several other people, but mainly...
###1042 How long have you had that?
###1043 You ain't answered me yet.
###1044 When did this arm begin to show that color?
###1046 Three days ago now, I think.
###1050 Get me some warm water, quick.
###1053 It ain't bad, is it?
###1054 Bad? It's gangrenous infection.
###1057 The flesh, it's rotting, it's dying.
###1059 You ain't no doctor.
###1060 You wanna live, don't you?
###1062 Why didn't you get this man to a doctor? Did.
###1064 There it be. Snake brew. You fool.
###1066 He'll die if something isn't done.
###1069 Am I dying, Judd?
###1072 Sure.
###1073 Better start making the pine box, I guess.
###1076 That's just what you will be doing if something isn't done.
###1082 Now listen to me.
###1083 Once an infection like this sets in, it kills.
###1085 The only possible cure is to cut it out, and then pray.
###1088 Now do you understand?
###1090 No. No. They don't understand.
###1093 They don't understand nothing but shooting and killing.
###1096 That's all they understand. Melissa.
###1098 I been begging you to get a doctor, but no, you got to plan.
###1101 You got to scheme, you got to figure out how to kill. All of you.
###1106 Your crops could rot and your cattle starve.
###1109 And you wouldn't care as long as you was back of a squirrel rifle,
###1112 and here was a Falin at the other end of it.
###1116 Now it's getting back at you. He's dying.
###1120 You heard him say it. My Davie's dying.
###1125 Melissa.
###1134 Here.
###1137 I'm sorry, I didn't know...
###1138 Here.
###1142 Get me a cloth, a tourniquet.
###1143 Something to tighten around his arm and shut off the circulation.
###1149 Get me some small knives, the sharpest you've got.
###1153 Get that fire going. Heat the knives till they're white-hot.
###1158 Keep that down and help me steady his arm.
###1182 This is going to hurt. We have no anesthetic.
###1184 Something to put you to sleep, I mean.
###1189 Better stouting up the corn liquor with a little pepper.
###1192 Looks like I'm gonna need it.
###1204 <i>Ain't got no money,</i> <i>nowhere to spend it</i>
###1209 <i>Ain't got no wife,</i> <i>too independent</i>
###1213 <i>Ain't got no mule</i> <i>to ride around</i>
###1219 <i>It's just because</i> <i>I'm the poorest man</i> <i>in town</i>
###1224 <i>Poor me</i> <i>Poor me</i>
###1229 <i>I wonder</i> <i>when I'm gonna</i> <i>end this misery</i>
###1233 I made up that last line myself.
###1235 Yeah? That's what it sounded like.
###1237 Thinking maybe you might have a job for me, so I moseyed up.
###1240 Well, mosey down, and the quicker the better.
###1243 What you got your back up for, mister?
###1244 Go on, get on.
###1248 They're talking down in town as to how
###1251 your boss saved Dave Tolliver's life.
###1253 That so? Yes, the idiot.
###1255 Two minutes after he'd met him,
###1257 he's carving his initials in the fellow's arm.
###1259 And does it get him anything? It does not.
###1261 The whole thing's a washout.
###1263 No coal, no railroad.
###1265 And as for this Judd Tolliver, he's just an ungrateful chunk of dry rot.
###1273 They didn't ask him, did they?
###1274 Ask him what?
###1276 To save Dave's life.
###1278 Of course they didn't, you walking phonograph.
###1281 But what's that got to do with it?
###1285 We ones is funny people.
###1288 Mmm. Elderberries.
###1295 Elderberries?
###1308 Okay, partner, here's where I get off the train.
###1310 Ain't I gonna see you no more?
###1312 Well, I don't know.
###1314 Not unless your dad changes his mind.
###1316 Now, don't you think you'd better run along home?
###1318 First, could I put my arms around you?
###1321 Can you? I'll say you can.
###1324 Say, you won't forget your lesson, will you?
###1326 Uh-uh.
###1327 Book learning is good for people
###1329 because it makes them build what's inside of them.
###1332 Swell.
###1333 Some day I'm gonna build a automobile, I'm gonna build a plane...
###1337 Whoa! Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
###1338 And all those things you told me about.
###1340 Well, if you're gonna do all that,
###1341 you'd better go home and start studying.
###1344 Bye. Goodbye.
###1345 Come on, Tuffy, grab the coal car.
###1351 There you go.
###1365 Well?
###1368 Pappy wants to see you.
###1369 He saw me, I'm sorry to say.
###1372 He changed his mind.
###1375 You mean he'll sign the agreement?
###1377 Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
###1384 Wait a minute. This isn't a gag, is it?
###1386 A what?
###1387 Skip it. I'll take a chance.
###1389 This way. It's shorter.
###1400 <i>Love is everywhere</i>
###1403 <i>Its music fills the air</i>
###1409 You gonna talk to me now?
###1411 Not a chance. Not even if your father signed 40 contracts.
###1414 I'm just as stubborn as you are, young lady.
###1415 And not word you get out of me until you've apologized.
###1417 I didn't do nothing.
###1418 You didn't do nothing? What do you call nothing?
###1420 You were going to spit in my eyes. You stomped on my foot.
###1423 And when I tried to teach Buddie his ABCs, you laughed at me.
###1425 And you call that nothing?
###1432 Oh, my! What a nice pretty.
###1434 Where'd you get it?
###1435 It's just a... Can I have it?
###1436 Why...
###1437 I can? Well, ain't that sweet?
###1441 What do you say to apologize?
###1443 Just say, "Mr. Hale, I regret exceedingly my unfortunate error."
###1446 Them's hard words.
###1447 All right. Say it your own way.
###1455 I regret.
###1457 You regret what?
###1459 I'm apologizing.
###1463 All right. What do you wanna talk about?
###1464 Don't make no difference.
###1466 All right. Let's talk about you.
###1467 I'd like that.
###1470 Well, some day very soon now, your father will have money,
###1473 and you'll be married to Dave.
###1475 And what a lucky girl you are.
###1477 And all this around here will be...
###1478 Well, maybe over there will be a big house
###1480 and with a lawn way down to here, and...
###1486 Did you ever see a grasshopper real close?
###1488 Have him spit in my eye? Not me.
###1490 You see that little yellow spot on its leg?
###1492 Well, if you touch it, you know what will happen?
###1494 No. I give up. What?
###1495 Its leg will pop off.
###1497 You little savage.
###1500 Am I?
###1502 Yes, you are. And when I see Dave, I'm gonna tell him.
###1504 Let's walk. It's a mite near a mile here.
###1506 A mile?
###1507 I thought you said this was a shortcut.
###1509 Did I?
###1519 "Its successors and assigns forever,
###1520 "all mines, veins, seams and beds of coal
###1523 "and all other minerals whatsoever already found
###1525 "or which may hereafter be found
###1527 "upon or under all that certain tract, piece or parcel of land
###1531 "situate, lying and being in the..."
###1532 Slow down, man.
###1534 Them squirrel tracks and chicken scratches don't mean nothing to me.
###1538 You trying to tell me and Judd your coal
###1539 won't be disruptious to our corn?
###1541 Is that what you're trying to tell us?
###1542 That's right.
###1544 And we get quite a toting of money?
###1545 $5,000 in 30 days and a percentage of the company's earnings.
###1549 What's that percentage?
###1550 It's like pigs, Pappy. You get one out of six for taking care of them.
###1553 Oh! Figures sensible.
###1555 Mr. Hale, is this the kind of steam shovel you told me about?
###1560 Yes, but you look in the back, Buddie,
###1561 and you'll find a great big one.
###1563 I'll give... Dave says it's sensible.
###1565 I guess it's sensible.
###1566 But there's one thing eating me.
###1568 What's that, Mr. Tolliver?
###1569 Is there no other way for you to build
###1571 your railroad up to our place,
###1573 except across the Falins?
###1575 But it won't be the Falins. The company will own the property.
###1577 Yeah, but it were the Falins.
###1579 They walked on it. They drove the sheep across it.
###1581 The spring water down by the Knuckle,
###1583 they put their poisonous faces in it.
###1585 It's got the Falins' smell on it.
###1587 And me ones will make money going on it? No.
###1590 No. There ain't gonna be a Tolliver...
###1592 It ain't gonna stop you from shooting the dirty swine, is it?
###1595 The land was here long afore they come. It's tetched with God.
###1598 And he ain't going to taint it just 'cause
###1600 a lot of snakes is a- crawling in the fallows.
###1602 We been poor-hogging long enough. I got a chance for fancies,
###1605 and I'm gonna have them.
###1607 That ain't no talk to your pappy.
###1608 I'm talking to you, too!
###1609 I ought to spank your hide.
###1610 You don't need no fotch-on clothes to be happy.
###1612 Just a minute, Dave. I didn't want to start an argument.
###1614 Mr. Tolliver, I don't doubt that you have
###1616 every reason to hate the Falins.
###1617 They must have done you a great wrong...
###1619 We don't want no preacher talk from you.
###1620 The Tollivers don't like the Falins and they know why.
###1623 And we don't want to be learned off by no outsiders.
###1626 But, Dave, I'm not trying to...
###1627 You saved my life.
###1628 You was leaving without a squeal when we turned you down.
###1631 You couldn't have done that without you was meaning right.
###1633 Just don't argue, that's all.
###1640 Where do we sign?
###1645 Right here.
###1666 The company's offering you $5,000.
###1668 That's a lot of money, Mr. Falin.
###1670 Both sides of our right of way will still be yours.
###1672 It won't interfere with your farming.
###1674 Mr. Thurber here can vouch for our company.
###1675 He's kept its books for years.
###1677 Yes. That's right. Indeed it is.
###1678 We don't want no tail-ender drippings of a Tolliver.
###1681 Wade's right. You can't make butter out of goose grease.
###1682 Shut up!
###1685 What did Judd Tolliver say?
###1687 Well, he said that...
###1692 He said he'd rot before he had anything to do with a Falin.
###1698 That sounds like Judd.
###1705 Where do I scratch?
###1708 Right here on the bottom line.
###1803 Jack, give us a hand.
###1805 You know something about carpentry.
###1806 What's the matter with it? You're doing all right.
###1808 Yeah, I'm not running any kindergarten.
###1809 I got very little use for children.
###1811 In fact I hate the brats.
###1812 Look at me. Look what I'm doing.
###1813 If any of my friends saw me...
###1816 Say, did you send that check to Judd Tolliver?
###1817 Yeah, this morning. Listen. Would you put a nail in here?
###1820 Or... Don't let me keep you.
###1845 Going 'coon hunting, Dave?
###1847 Skunk.
###1852 Mighty nigh well, ain't it?
###1854 That's why I'm going hunting.
###1856 I don't want you to fight, Dave.
###1858 Leave the Falins be.
###1860 There's turning over to be done.
###1862 And I'll be wanting corn husks for my mattresses.
###1865 And we got scrapple to make and all kinds of things.
###1869 You're the only big boy I've got, Dave.
###1872 Families round about got lots.
###1873 Maybe they wouldn't miss them none.
###1875 Maybe they wouldn't.
###1877 You're always snorting preachments, Auntie. You make me sick.
###1885 Two pink-eyed doves sitting in a tree.
###1888 One for you and one for me.
###1893 Dave.
###1895 My eggs.
###1896 Ma! Pa! Dave! We just got a letter.
###1902 We just got a letter.
###1905 Pa. A letter.
###1907 Juny.
###1909 We just got a letter.
###1910 A man gave to me up the road.
###1914 Ma, look!
###1915 You act like we never got one before.
###1918 We got one when Dave come to live with us
###1920 and then we got another one when...
###1924 Who's it for?
###1925 Whoever it's writ to on the front.
###1927 Sure enough.
###1930 Well, might as well open it.
###1931 What for? We ain't going to be no better off.
###1934 Well, you ain't much help.
###1936 Open her up anyway, Judd.
###1957 It's from the coal company. See?
###1959 There's a picture of a mine on it.
###1962 $5,000.
###1965 It's just a piece of paper.
###1969 This here's a check.
###1971 I seen one once in Gaptown.
###1973 Folks, we're richer than cream cheese.
###1975 And I can get the things I want, can't I, Pappy?
###1978 Now, now, now. Not so jumpy.
###1980 There's one thing we got to get
###1982 more important than that first,
###1984 and that's a new dress for Melissa.
###1988 Oh! Judd.
###1989 You sure got it coming to you, Mammy.
###1992 With pearl buttons it'll have. Won't it, Pappy?
###1993 Yeah, pearl buttons. And the next thing
###1996 we got to get is hat and shoes for Mammy.
###2001 It just... You're making me cry.
###2006 Judd Tolliver, you said you weren't talking to me.
###2008 That was when I was poor. $5,000.
###2012 Wait a minute. I got some choosing to do, too.
###2014 Part of that's mine.
###2015 Sure. Half.
###2017 Half? I get way less than half.
###2019 My land's just a little hog bag.
###2024 Which way says you win or lose?
###2027 North.
###2031 South. You lose, so you get half.
###2043 You know the first thing I'm gonna buy?
###2046 Dave Tolliver, get some pepper in you.
###2048 What?
###2049 For more than a month now,
###2050 somebody's been a - keeping a secret in a closet.
###2052 And I'm thinking maybe it's a picture of something she's a-needing.
###2055 So the first thing I'm gonna do...
###2056 Oh, no. Now, Dave.
###2058 Yes, now.
###2059 Dave, don't.
###2063 Dave. Can't hear. Both ears is bad.
###2065 If you go in that closet...
###2067 Next time I'll puff you clean over to Coon Hollow.
###2076 If you go in there, I'll never talk to you again.
###2077 Why, it's only fun. There ain't nothing in there you want.
###2079 Nothing that'd be important to you. June.
###2081 Never. I only want to buy...
###2083 Never.
###2085 Dave.
###2092 You're sure pretty.
###2095 Am I?
###2096 Like a budding sapling without even room for a robin to sit.
###2100 You're just silly.
###2103 I been silly ever since the sap come up out of the trees.
###2106 I get silly just looking at you.
###2108 When we get married...
###2110 It ain't green up yet.
###2111 You're going to have ivory combs in your hair
###2112 and you're gonna have blood-red wine to drink.
###2114 Wine?
###2116 And down by the sty, we'll build a big house...
###2118 With grass growing all the way down?
###2122 The ivory combs, they was my idea.
###2124 And the big house?
###2126 Mr. Hale. He thought of that.
###2128 He's drawn me a piece of paper.
###2129 It's got a bathtub in it, June.
###2130 In the middle of the house it is.
###2132 And it's get water that can be turned on with the handle.
###2134 And there's a room where you keep babies, and it's...
###2136 Get out of here, Dave.
###2138 Honey.
###2142 Dave, please.
###2146 Sure.
###2175 <i>Love is everywhere</i>
###2177 <i>Its music fills the air</i>
###2181 <i>All nature seems to hum</i> <i>"A melody from the sky!"</i>
###2188 <i>Over on the hill,</i> <i>I see a whippoorwill</i>
###2193 <i>I hear its song become</i> <i>"A melody from the sky!"</i>
###2200 <i>And there's a bluebird</i> <i>singing to</i> <i>his lady love above</i>
###2207 <i>A love song</i>
###2209 <i>taken from</i> <i>the whispering breeze</i> <i>in the trees</i>
###2214 <i>Love is everywhere</i>
###2217 <i>Its music fills the air</i>
###2220 <i>All nature seems to hum</i>

###2229 By Juckies, that's what I call whistling and singing.
###2232 I'm awful glad to see you, Tater.
###2235 Well, you never was before.
###2236 You've changed. You're different.
###2238 You're... I'm awful glad to see you.
###2240 You said that.
###2241 Did I? Well, I am glad.
###2244 Well, here he is, safe and delivered. So long.
###2247 Bye, Tater.
###2248 Goodbye, engineer. And don't forget what Mr. Hale told you.
###2251 Watch the steam in your boiler.
###2253 <i>Love is everywhere</i>
###2256 <i>Its music fills the air</i>
###2260 <i>All nature seems to hum</i> <i>"A melody from the sky!"</i>
###2269 <i>Love is everywhere</i>
###2283 David, get away from there.
###2288 Dave, you ain't said nothing about my steam shovel.
###2292 Your... Is that what it is?
###2295 Yeah. It works, too.
###2297 Uncle Jack, he showed me...
###2298 Uncle Jack?
###2300 Uh-huh. Mr. Hale. You know. He said, "When this thing gets up here,
###2306 "you got to pull this thing." See? See how it works?
###2310 Hemlocks. Mr. Hale's sure smart, ain't he?
###2312 Bet he is. Sis, she says he's the smartestest man she ever seen.
###2319 She said what?
###2323 Sure works, don't it?
###2325 I'm wanna be an engineer, too, when I get big.
###2331 When did June say that about Mr. Hale?
###2335 She says it all the time, every day at most, when she takes me down there.
###2339 She takes you down there every day?
###2341 Uh-huh. I sit with Corsey, I do.
###2344 Corsey?
###2346 He's an engineer.
###2347 He's the best, he is.
###2352 What does June do when you're with Corsey, Buddie?
###2355 She goes walking with Uncle Jack.
###2357 They don't bother me at all.
###2363 Now watch me. Tuffy, go on.
###2365 Go get some coal.
###2368 Go on, go get some coal.
###2371 Oh! Buddie.
###2373 Huh?
###2376 Nothing.
###2455 Mr. Thurber, Mr. Thurber.
###2457 Hello, Buddie.
###2460 I hope he ain't no bother to you, Mr. Thurber.
###2462 Bother! Really I'm compelled to laugh.
###2463 This charming little fellow.
###2465 Ridiculous, Miss Tolliver.
###2466 It's only when you've seen the world like I have,
###2468 that you learn to appreciate the laughter of children.
###2470 Their childish pranks and their naive questions.
###2473 I remember once on the boat coming over from England.
###2476 There was dear little curly-headed fellow, he must have been about...
###2479 June, there's Mr. Corsey.
###2482 Corsey.
###2484 Howdy, son. What's holding you up?
###2487 Come on.
###2490 How are you this morning? All right.
###2492 Atta boy! Whoops-a-daisy.
###2495 Charming child.
###2496 Yes.
###2505 Mr. Thurber, you better check with Mills
###2506 about that last carload of ties.
###2507 They weren't creosoted. They can't...
###2512 Again?
###2514 Mmm-hmm.
###2518 I'm busy. Come on, get up.
###2523 You can see that, can't you?
###2524 Uh-huh.
###2525 Well?
###2526 Mmm-hmm.
###2528 You call that an answer? Mmm-hmm.
###2530 Listen, Miss Uh-uh and Uh-huh.
###2532 Outside, up the hill to your family.
###2533 You've probably got plenty of work to do.
###2535 And don't say uh-huh. Uh-uh.
###2539 Woman, you're a nut.
###2540 Good. I like that.
###2541 You like being a nut.
###2543 No, being a woman.
###2544 Until now, you've been thinking I'm a girl.
###2546 You're not a woman. You're not even a girl.
###2548 I ain't?
###2550 No, you're just a child no bigger than that.
###2554 And from here up?
###2555 I'm not fooling you. I'm going to tell you something.
###2557 What do you do with your spare time?
###2560 This is very interesting.
###2565 Now, stop your clowning.
###2566 June, you're making a big mistake.
###2568 Pretty soon you'll be married to Dave,
###2569 and what have you done about it?
###2571 What do you want me to do?
###2573 I want you to go to school.
###2575 To what? School.
###2576 Can't you realize what the future holds for you and your family?
###2580 Uh-huh.
###2581 All right, what? A fight with the Falins.
###2584 You're impossible.
###2586 I ain't impossible.
###2588 I'd like to know what you'd call it.
###2589 I can listen.
###2590 You can?
###2591 All right, listen to this. Look at Buddie.
###2593 He's a swell little kid and he's smart as a whip.
###2595 He'll learn and he'll learn fast.
###2597 And the minute he arrives, these mountains can't hold him.
###2599 He'll change, June, and you'll he proud of him,
###2601 but you'll be unhappy too because he'll speak a different language.
###2604 You're smart and I can understand you.
###2608 Look, June, I'm not trying to hurt your feelings.
###2609 I think you're a swell girl.
###2611 But if you ever were in the city once,
###2612 just once, you'd understand what I mean.
###2614 Remember what you told me yesterday.
###2616 None of you could read that check.
###2618 $5,000. But you just guessed at it
###2619 because there was a picture of a coal mine on it.
###2621 And from now on, Dave and your father
###2623 will be getting lots of letters.
###2624 See what I mean?
###2626 I ain't going to no town.
###2627 You don't have to. You can get some books and read at home.
###2629 Hire a teacher.
###2631 You've got money, and you'll have more.
###2633 And once you get into it, you'll be so blamed happy
###2634 you'll want to give me a big hug.
###2636 Would I?
###2645 Hello. Hale speaking, Operator.
###2649 Hello, Lewis. What's on your mind?
###2651 You what?
###2653 You want me to come to town?
###2656 Listen, I've got some bulldogs up here
###2658 by the name of Tolliver and Falin.
###2659 And if I leave...
###2662 Yeah, Lewis, but I...
###2664 Oh...
###2666 All right. Yeah.
###2668 I'll leave in the morning. Right.
###2671 Hey, wait a minute. What about those ties?
###2674 You did, huh?
###2680 Okay, I'll see you soon.
###2681 Well, June, it looks like...
###2696 The mountains is good enough for us. They're good enough for you.
###2699 You ain't a- going to town.
###2700 But, Judd...
###2701 I'm a-talking. The idea.
###2704 You getting close to marrying time and wanting to go to school.
###2707 You gonna make clabber cheese any better if you can read and write?
###2710 Or churn butter or fix a shirt or mend socks?
###2713 That's what a wife is supposed to do.
###2715 Don't take no education to show you where a hen lays her eggs.
###2718 I ain't gonna listen to any more.
###2719 June.
###2723 Yeah, and you can use it till the blood comes.
###2725 But I won't change my mind.
###2727 You and the mountains ain't going to make
###2728 no dried up cornstalk out of me.
###2730 You ain't got the right.
###2732 I'm gonna be smart and I'm gonna think.
###2735 Yes, I am. And I'm gonna be a help to Dave
###2737 when those checks start coming in.
###2739 You ain't ever been to the city. You don't know what it means.
###2741 You're going to stay here.
###2743 And be a cull, just like Mammy?
###2744 June.
###2747 She knows what I'm driving at.
###2749 She ain't never get to go no place.
###2751 Just stayed here and dried up.
###2753 Getting older, faster than she should.
###2755 Weren't you, Mammy?
###2756 I was born old.
###2758 She could have been young and beautiful.
###2761 She is beautiful. Listen, June child.
###2765 I ain't no mean father.
###2767 I mean, I ain't a never wanting to be.
###2769 You looked at me just like a stranger, just now.
###2773 Kind of hurt inside.
###2777 Pappy.
###2784 Sure be glad to give you a lift, Miss June.
###2786 This animal of mine will carry double and get you to Gaptown
###2789 quicker than a hound dog can smell a pole cat.
###2791 That's very nice of you, Mr. Keever
###2793 but I'm a-waiting, a friend, you know.
###2795 Oh!
###2798 The smell of winter's stouter than horse radish.
###2801 Hope it don't kick up a rain.
###2803 Goodbye. Bye.
###2836 Where you going?
###2838 That a way.
###2839 Just a stroll?
###2841 Oh, no. Going to town.
###2843 Smell of winter's stouter than horse radish.
###2852 Thought you told me you'd never been to town.
###2854 Might, might not.
###2856 Hope it don't kick up a rain.
###2858 I give up. Come on, get in.
###2861 No. I wouldn't. It might be putting you out.
###2864 It's only a short hop and a tussle to town.
###2866 Get in.
###2873 Say, if it's any of my business, why are you going to town?
###2875 Education. Do you have to keep your foot on the brake all the time?
###2878 When did you get that idea?
###2880 I see you keep jiggling it back and...
###2881 You know what I mean. When?
###2884 Talking to people.
###2885 Who?
###2887 Oh, about.
###2888 It was what I told you, wasn't it?
###2891 Did you?
###2893 Yes, you was one of them.
###2894 I was all of them.
###2896 Now see here, I meant what I said. I sincerely meant it.
###2899 But you're up to something phony.
###2901 People don't just get an idea and then go.
###2903 Did you ever stand under a falling tree or see a pole cat back up?
###2907 That's not funny.
###2908 What did your father say about it, and Dave?
###2910 They was mostly agreeing, especially Dave.
###2913 He said when those checks start traipsing in...
###2914 I said that.
###2916 All right, I'll walk.
###2928 Same thing eating you?
###2930 Huh?
###2931 Sure makes me feel bad.
###2933 That's what I wanna talk to you about.
###2935 Nice of you. Horse gets out of the barn
###2937 and now you want to lock the door.
###2939 Well, he ain't got her yet.
###2942 Who ain't got what... Wait a minute.
###2944 Ain't you and I talking about the same thing?
###2946 You bet we're talking about the same thing.
###2948 I was feeling when he saved my life
###2949 but I just didn't know what it was then.
###2952 Fever I says. Or maybe the lead's splashing something in my eyes.
###2956 But I ought to have known. It was him being nice to Buddie.
###2958 It was him... Wait a minute, son.
###2959 You're making a gourd trap,
###2961 but it's too big to catch meadow larks and too small to catch ideas.
###2964 What are you talking about?
###2966 Let's get June right here.
###2967 We ones is going to settle this matter for good.
###2970 You want her here? Fine.
###2972 You tell her she could go to town,
###2973 now you tell me you want her here.
###2975 Ain't you a little tetched?
###2976 I tell her she can go where?
###2978 Into town to get educated.
###2979 Got to read books, she said you said.
###2981 Don't want no cull for a wife, she said you said.
###2984 She said... She ain't gone.
###2985 You didn't let her go, did you?
###2986 Of course, been gone maybe two hours now.
###2988 Took her down to the ridge to meet the mailman.
###2991 She said... It was him that done it.
###2993 Him that said he was our friend.
###2994 That's why he gave us the money.
###2996 That's why he gave us the money. You understand?
###2998 He took her away.
###2999 He's been wanting to take her, but he was a-feared.
###3001 All right.
###3002 He thinks now maybe the money will keep us from telling him
###3004 that we ones up here don't take nobody's woman.
###3007 Money ain't a- stopping us from that.
###3009 Money ain't a- stopping us from...
###3010 Where are you going?
###3012 I'm going hunting.
###3019 You're sure that was Dave Tolliver?
###3021 He was a-headed for the camp and across our property, too.
###3024 If he's down there, he's on our property.
###3027 Might just as well go down and look into it.
###3029 That's my job.
###3031 I've been sort of shamed since I only get him in the arm.
###3033 You're right.
###3035 Rub out the mistake, Son.
###3041 So help me, he isn't here.
###3043 On my word of honor, he isn't here. Do you understand me?
###3045 Yeah.
###3046 He went downtown. Down to Gaptown, I mean.
###3049 She didn't go with him? No, I told you!
###3051 He was alone, and... You sure they didn't meet some place?
###3053 With these, I saw him.
###3054 He got into his wagon, on this side...
###3058 You ain't answering my question.
###3059 I can't answer that 'cause I don't know.
###3061 I watched him there on the road.
###3062 There was nobody with him then, because...
###3145 Mr. Thurber, I'm a-quitting.
###3147 No, you're not.
###3148 In times like this, you gotta be a man.
###3149 A man must never been a coward.
###3151 I got to get to Gaptown to tell the people down there what's up.
###3153 But it's over. There's nothing to tell!
###3155 There ain't, eh? You don't know.
###3157 Look at here, Dave Tolliver's gone to Gaptown to get Mr. Hale.
###3160 He bust Wade Falin on the beak.
###3162 And when a Tolliver busts a Falin on the beak, that means war.
###3165 And I gotta tell a- people in Gaptown,
###3166 so they can scuttle for safety.
###3169 Good heavens!
###3178 Jenkins.
###3180 Jenkins.
###3182 Biggest fight. Outside camp.
###3184 Wade Falin came down... Dave Tolliver...
###3189 And shoved him over the cliff...
###3198 I knew that thing was going to break out again.
###3201 Just a matter of time and that's all we needed.
###3209 And I was standing right there.
###3211 I heard enough.
###3212 And he...
###3225 Dave Tolliver licked Wade Falin.
###3226 And now he's coming to get Mr. Hale.
###3235 Whoa!
###3244 Is there anything else you need? No.
###3245 Well, if you think of anything, just call the camp
###3247 and I'll have one of the men bring it down.
###3249 I'm sorry, but... Well?
###3251 The room, you know, where Miss Tolliver was going to stay...
###3254 Well, that room, I'm afraid...
###3255 Afraid of what?
###3256 Well, it ain't a fitting place.
###3258 It kind of leaks, you know.
###3259 Hold it. There's trouble, ain't there?
###3262 Trouble?
###3263 I can smell it. What's wrong?
###3265 I don't want no fighting.
###3267 Fighting?
###3268 Dave.
###3270 Say, what is this?
###3271 He's coming to get me.
###3272 Who told you? You've seen him?
###3274 All town knows it. And I don't want no trouble around here.
###3280 You gotta go.
###3281 I've got to what?
###3283 I know... I've seen him the time he shot down Jim Falin.
###3287 You gotta get out of town.
###3288 What have I done to him that he should want to harm me?
###3290 Did I ever do anything to him?
###3291 No, you didn't.
###3292 But I wish I hadn't come down.
###3296 Will you go? Please go.
###3297 You lied, didn't you?
###3298 Everything you said coming down out of the mountains?
###3300 I knew you were lying then, and something inside of me
###3302 told me I should have sent you home.
###3305 Well, let him come.
###3307 I never saw such a ferocious look in a man's eyes in my life.
###3309 I tell you, it's gonna be the biggest fight of the year.
###3316 Dave... Dave come out of the tent, like a shot.
###3318 He lit right on top of Wade.
###3320 And rammed down on him with a right and left! Right!
###3322 Wade got away from Dave.
###3324 Dave got him right on the edge of the cliff, he had him down,
###3326 he was beating his head down and he says,
###3327 "I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill you!
###3329 "You'll take my girl, will you?"
###3330 He reached him up and he says...
###3333 Nice day, ain't it?
###3335 Give me a beer.
###3339 I gotta see somebody.
###3341 Yeah, Dave Tolliver.
###3344 And how'd you like to tell him we was here.
###3347 In the backroom.
###3365 There's Dave Tolliver coming in now.
###3368 And he ain't going out.
###3369 You can get him right from here.
###3370 We don't have to sneak our shots at the Tolliver.
###3373 Stay here, Wade.
###3375 Hell.
###3378 You sing about Stack O'Lee and keep right on singing.
###3387 <i>When the rain</i> <i>was falling fast</i>
###3390 <i>One dark and stormy night</i>
###3393 <i>Stack O'Lee and Billy Lyons</i> <i>Had an awful fight</i>
###3400 <i>Bad, bad,</i> <i>bad old Stack O'Lee</i>
###3409 You ain't going to do nothing, Dave. It's all my fault.
###3412 Talk will keep.
###3413 Now, let's get this thing straight.
###3415 You're down here looking for trouble.
###3417 I haven't done anything, but I can see you won't believe that.
###3419 All right.
###3426 This is worth walking for.
###3442 How are you doing, Buck? Drop them gun.
###3445 We're going about our own business.
###3447 Of course, you are. Put them down.
###3450 Certainly.
###3452 Anything to oblige.
###3454 Funny you ain't trying to stop the fight.
###3456 Fist fight won't do no harm.
###3459 Gun toting don't go.
###3461 No hard feeling.
###3464 No.
###3466 No.
###3493 You're doing a good job, Mr. Hale. Maybe we can help you.
###3505 So that's the way it is, huh?
###3507 Any way you wanna look at it.
###3508 You shouldn't mess in old troubles.
###3520 <i>Dogs did howl</i>
###3523 <i>Dogs did bark</i>
###3526 <i>When Stack O'Lee</i> <i>the murderer</i>
###3529 <i>went creeping</i> <i>through the dark</i>
###3533 <i>Bad, bad,</i> <i>bad old Stack O'Lee</i>
###3562 Get out of here and take her with you!
###3564 I can run from no Falin.
###3567 I guess, here in the mountains a woman doesn't mean very much.
###3572 You came here to get her, didn't you?
###3579 <i>Bam, bam, bam, bam</i>
###3582 <i>Went Stack's. 44</i>
###3585 <i>Next time I saw Billy Lyons</i>
###3588 <i>He's stretched out</i> <i>on the floor</i>
###3592 <i>Bad, bad,</i> <i>bad old Stack O'Lee</i>
###3598 <i>Stop your drinking whiskey</i>
###3600 <i>With your...</i>
###3603 <i>Look what happened</i> <i>to poor old Stack O'Lee</i>
###3611 Okay, I'm licked.
###3613 So what?
###3615 You got lots to learn, Mr. Hale, lots.
###3617 I scratched a bargain with you
###3618 on a piece of paper, and I kept it.
###3620 But now, you're sticking your nose in my personal affairs,
###3623 so from now on bargains don't count.
###3625 And you won't be long finding that out.
###3642 Jack! Jack!
###3648 Dave Tolliver! He's coming to get you!
###3650 There's going to be a big fight.
###3653 Is there?
###3674 What are you doing here?
###3676 I'm here 'cause I ain't going back.
###3678 I thought I told Dave to take you...
###3679 The sheriff said, "I'm taking you
###3681 "to the outskirts of town, Dave Tolliver.
###3683 "I'm leaving the rest to your own judgment."
###3685 Now see here, I'm not going to allow you...
###3686 I ain't listening.
###3687 You told me to get an education, I'm getting an education.
###3690 I'm staying here. If I can't stay here, I'll stay where I can stay.
###3693 You can't stop me, nobody's gonna stop me!
###3695 I'll show the whole kit and boodle of you how much I can get learned.
###3698 I'll be smarter than you! That's what I'll be!
###3700 Now listen, you little stick of dynamite.
###3702 You're getting out of here now.
###3703 You're going back up in the mountains.
###3705 I've heard enough of you and I've seen enough of you.
###3706 For the present, at least. Now, come on, get out.
###3710 You...
###3714 All right, I'll go
###3717 if you want me to go.
###3719 Sure.
###3721 I don't want people not to want me.
###3725 Wait a minute.
###3727 How did you do that?
###3729 Oh, that.
###3734 You did it when you pushed me down.
###3738 I'm sorry.
###3740 It might have been a rusty nail or something.
###3742 We'd better fix it up. Come over here.
###3750 So that's it, is it?
###3752 And I thought you were just interested in the coal business.
###3755 She's hurt her hand.
###3756 You've killed your future, around here, anyway.
###3760 You're not satisfied with one enemy, you make two.
###3762 You realize what you've done?
###3764 Now the Falins hate you, the Tollivers will never forgive you.
###3767 The Tollivers, why? That's why.
###3769 That girl's gonna go back to the mountains, now.
###3772 She didn't come here to start any trouble, it just happened.
###3774 She's got a mind of her own, and if she wants to stay here she can.
###3777 In this town? Lmpossible.
###3778 I'll take her to Brighton.
###3780 Or Plenny or Sand Creek. It doesn't matter where you take her
###3782 around here, you're about to meet Tollivers.
###3783 All right, I'll take her to Louisville to my sister.
###3785 What do you think of that? Nothing.
###3787 Except that I'm flabbergasted.
###3788 Nonplussed.
###3790 And if you don't mind me saying so,
###3791 I think you're just a little bit nuts.
###3795 Thank you.
###3798 Both of you.
###3834 Mr. Hale! Oh, Mr. Hale! You forgot the hat.
###3838 Thanks, Leo.
###3849 Well, here you are.
###3850 Do I...
###3851 Are you sure your sister will recognize me?
###3854 I don't see how she can miss.
###3855 Do I look all right?
###3857 My dear young lady, reticent as I am by nature,
###3860 it behooves me at this moment to tell you
###3861 that you're wearing the finest the city affords.
###3863 All aboard!
###3865 Well, you better get on.
###3872 Ain't... Ain't you gonna kiss me goodbye?
###3905 Well, that's over with. Is it?
###3907 Yeah. What do you mean, "Is it"?
###3909 No, I mean, I'm glad it's over with.
###3911 Are you?
###3912 She's nuts. Is she?
###3914 Sure she is. Any fool can see that.
###3915 Well, perhaps, that's why I'm a little stupid.
###3917 Yeah, maybe that's...
###3919 Say, what is this "isn't" and "is she"?
###3920 My dear fellow, if you'll allow me,
###3922 let us take "isn't" and "is she."
###3924 "Is" is that we both know, I hope, is a verb.
###3927 "It" is a neuter gender, and she is the feminine.
###3930 Thus, we have the neuter and the feminine, but no masculine.
###3933 "What? No masculine," you say, then I say...
###3936 "I'm nuts," that's what you say.
###3938 Yeah, that's right, you're nuts!
###3939 She's in love with you, Jack.
###3941 In love? Who? June.
###3943 Are you crazy?
###3944 No, no, that's already been settled.
###3945 You're the one who's crazy.
###3947 Why, she's been goo-gooing, gee-geeing all over you
###3950 ever since we started the camp.
###3951 Don't talk nonsense.
###3953 In love. Why, she only came down to camp to bring Buddie.
###3956 In love with me. You're an idiot.
###3958 I hope so.
###3959 I sincerely hope so.
###3968 The camp, Thurber. It's on fire!
###4029 A bunch of fellows came over the hill carrying torches.
###4031 The fellow leading him was a-shooting.
###4032 The Falins.
###4034 Well... Never mind, we'll talk about that later.
###4036 I'll get the stock out of the corral.
###4037 You get the instruments and maps out of there.
###4100 So that's how you want it, is it?
###4104 All right, you skulking coyotes, I'll play your game.
###4107 They're not gonna let me...
###4110 I'll put this road through if I have to use your dirty rotten bodies for ties.
###4115 I'll do it if I have to hire every man in Gaptown to finish the job.
###4146 If you could have seen it
###4147 I know you would have split your sides a - laughing.
###4149 I was sitting there mending, and I hear the dripping and the sizzling,
###4153 and I says to myself, I says, "I bet a rooster
###4155 "it's the soft soap a- boiling over."
###4157 And sure enough...
###4158 Better try some of these dandelion greens, son.
###4161 Zeke Denker fetched them over this morning.
###4164 I ain't hungry.
###4165 But, David, you gotta eat something
###4167 after all the plowing you've done.
###4169 Pappy.
###4171 A is the first letter in the alphabet.
###4175 Because it means "And" "Apple" and "Ax."
###4183 What's this one, Pappy?
###4185 You mean this one?
###4189 Offhand I'd say it's alike an ox yoke.
###4192 Didn't Mr. Hale tell you?
###4195 He told me but I forgot.
###4197 It ain't like no Tolliver to forget.
###4200 Now, if I would have been told...
###4204 You know what that is?
###4207 Yeah.
###4209 Civilization!
###4216 David, you oughtn't to have done that!
###4217 I'm through pretending.
###4218 Like you've been doing all of last month.
###4220 Saying things you didn't mean.
###4221 I'm getting sick of the whole thing.
###4223 Now, son, look, you gotta keep your shirt on.
###4226 If it's June you're worrying about, she'll be back pretty short.
###4229 No, she ain't.
###4230 She ain't never coming back. Not the June I know.
###4233 Ain't nothing gonna be the way it was.
###4235 Look at Buddie, even he's different.
###4238 So are you. Me?
###4239 Yes, you are.
###4241 Them new fangled machines down in Ticopi that's doing it.
###4243 Every day you traipse down there with Buddie
###4245 and you come back being different.
###4246 Half the time you're feeling glad.
###4248 Like last week, they tore up one of our fields.
###4250 Them machines don't care who's been plowing there for 50 years.
###4253 The Tollivers don't mean nothing to them.
###4255 I ain't nobody with a high temper.
###4257 But you're talking unreasonable.
###4259 We're getting rich, ain't we?
###4260 Look at them five checks over there in that bowl.
###4263 Half of them is yours.
###4264 And how did we get them? Just doing nothing.
###4267 And if that's what you call civilization, then I'm for it.
###4270 Judd! He needs a-talking to.
###4272 It ain't right for no young man to brood about nothing.
###4275 This you call nothing, huh?
###4276 Listen, there's got to be a change, you see?
###4278 Not for me, there ain't.
###4279 There ain't no more chance of me changing
###4281 than there is of that old Lonesome Pine changed into a hickory.
###4283 I belong to the earth. The plowed up soil.
###4285 I was raised and I'm gonna die in it.
###4287 You got what you like? You can have it.
###4289 Me, I'm going back. Back where my pappy raised me.
###4294 David, you can't do that.
###4296 You're our boy. I mean, you're like our boy.
###4299 I ain't a-wanting you to go.
###4305 Two pink-eyed doves sitting in a tree,
###4309 one for you, one for me.
###4311 For June.
###4339 <i>For when</i> <i>it's twilight on the trail</i>
###4346 <i>And I jog along</i>
###4350 <i>The world is like a dream</i>
###4354 <i>And the ripple</i> <i>of the stream</i>
###4359 <i>Is my song</i>
###4363 <i>For when it's twilight</i> <i>on the trail</i>
###4385 Hello?
###4388 Well, well, well, Miss Tolliver.
###4392 What, again?
###4393 Obviously.
###4394 Do I tell her you're out to tea?
###4396 No, I'll talk to her.
###4401 You'd better go out and check with Marks about those uprights.
###4404 Naturally.
###4407 Hello, June.
###4408 Are you mad at somebody or something?
###4411 Well, you talk like it.
###4414 Oh, yeah.
###4417 Busy? You don't know what busy means.
###4419 I ain't...
###4420 I mean, I haven't had a minute to myself.
###4424 This morning I learnt all about the Revolution.
###4426 It was just like a feud.
###4429 In 1775...
###4432 Wait a minute, June. Come in.
###4434 Mr. Hale, we've got that slue banked.
###4436 That's fine, Taylor.
###4437 Wait a minute, get the steam shovel out on the bridge
###4440 so we can start to fill in the morning.
###4441 Yes, sir.
###4443 Yeah, June?
###4445 Yeah.
###4447 But that wasn't Patrick Henry, that was Lord Cornwallis.
###4450 Cornwallis.
###4452 All right. Cornwallis.
###4453 What difference does it make?
###4457 How are you?
###4460 How's Pappy and Mammy and Buddie?
###4463 They are?
###4465 Yeah.
###4473 Say, June, you know you've got the prettiest eyes.
###4477 Yeah.
###4480 And the cutest nose.
###4484 Say, have you got a dimple?
###4496 You get a fix, Son?
###4498 She's all sort onto the bridge and ready to go.
###4500 We'll pop her off in the morning.
###4501 Kind of like to have Mr. Hale see it.
###4528 Hey, Pappy.
###4530 Now we're here for Mr. Corsey?
###4534 Yeah, but you stay right here till your pappy
###4536 gets through talking to Mr. Hale.
###4538 Thanks, Pappy.
###4557 Can I come in, Mr. Hale?
###4560 Sure, come on in.
###4564 I got serious things to talk to you about, Mr. Hale.
###4567 Sit down.
###4577 And now, it's Dave that's going away.
###4579 It's gotten me worried.
###4580 About Melissa, I mean.
###4582 She don't sing no more, Mr. Hale.
###4584 Sun up always seen her singing, you know?
###4587 I'm sorry about Melissa, but there's nothing I can do.
###4590 I got troubles of my own.
###4591 You gotta come, Mr. Hale.
###4593 Melissa, she'll listen to you.
###4596 Somehow, I don't talk the right language to her.
###4598 No wonder you can't speak a language which Melissa understands.
###4600 I've never heard her favor your feud to the Falins.
###4603 Have you done anything to stop it? No, you haven't.
###4605 You came down here to blame me
###4606 for June's going away and for Dave's leaving.
###4608 You'd like to thrust the responsibility
###4610 for Melissa's suffering on my shoulders.
###4611 Well, you don't do it. I've got enough of you and your whole stupid outfit.
###4625 I'm sorry, Judd, I...
###4627 I didn't really mean what I said.
###4629 Sure glad.
###4631 I liked you the first day you walked into my house.
###4636 Wait a minute.
###4640 Hello?
###4642 Yes, Hale speaking.
###4644 Louisville? Just a minute.
###4647 You wanna speak to June?
###4650 Can I?
###4651 Come here.
###4653 <i>Hold that up to your ear.</i>
###4659 Now, talk right in here.
###4661 What for?
###4663 Well, you wanna speak to June, don't you?
###4665 But you said she was in Louisville.
###4666 Well, that's where she is.
###4672 <i>Hello, Pappy.</i>
###4675 June.
###4678 Where are you hiding?
###4679 I'm not hiding, Pappy. I'm in Louisville.
###4684 She says she's in Louisville.
###4686 Well, that's what I told you.
###4689 Is this thing hollow all the way through?
###4691 Yeah, all the way through.
###4692 Well...
###4699 Hello, little brush rabbit.
###4728 You didn't, huh?
###4733 You know what your ma said this morning?
###4757 Operator?
###4763 Buddie! Buddie is in there.
###4770 Buddie.
###4772 Pappy.
###4774 Jack.
###4776 Pappy!
###4782 Buddie! Buddie!
###4787 Buddie!
###4795 <i></i>
###4799 Buddie. Buddie.
###4802 <i>Get me Dr. Owen, quick.</i>
###4805 Get me some hot water.
###4812 Buddie.
###4816 Son. It's your pappy, Son.
###4820 Oh, God, don't let him die.
###4823 Don't take him away from my poor Melissa.
###4828 Buddie.
###4832 <i>Buddie.</i>
###4880 You may be the civil law around here, but get this,
###4882 interference with the public carriers, the railroad, I mean,
###4885 that's a federal offense.
###4886 It might have been an accident.
###4888 But it wasn't!
###4890 It was cold wanton murder!
###4891 They killed little Buddie! They murdered him! A baby!
###4894 And I'm gonna put them where they rot.
###4896 Not for a murder, your heels are too smart for that.
###4898 And there's not a man in this town with courage enough to convict him.
###4901 But you're gonna make out a warrant on my charges!
###4903 You're gonna do what I say.
###4904 And you're gonna do everything I say.
###4906 Mr. Hale, I've lived in this country for more than 50 years.
###4911 I was born here, and I know these people.
###4914 I can bring the Falins to court. Maybe hang them.
###4917 But that don't stop feuds. It makes them.
###4921 There'd be killings like we've never seen before.
###4924 Mountain people don't seem to like law, Mr. Hale.
###4927 Down here, peace has got to come from within.
###4930 It all seems kind of brutal and primitive while it's a-boiling,
###4933 but, well, I was born here and I know.
###4937 I'm talking honest, Mr. Hale.
###4940 You know, I...
###4942 I cried when they told me Buddie was killed.
###4945 Why, I used to ride miles out of my way
###4947 to fetch him some stick candy.
###4949 But I like Jim Falin, too.
###4951 That was before you come here.
###4954 He's older than Buddie but just a kid.
###4957 Eyes always a-laughing.
###4959 He was Buck's favorite son.
###4962 Dave Tolliver shot him.
###4964 Had reasons, I guess.
###4967 Or I could have cramped him in jail.
###4968 Yes, I could.
###4970 But did you ever get up close to Melissa and look into her eyes?
###4974 Well, you do that sometime.
###4975 Then you tell me what kind of a law
###4977 you can think of that will correct it.
###4981 Tell me... June!
###4991 He couldn't just die, could he?
###4995 He had to be killed.
###4998 Killed by the Falin.
###5000 They did that.
###5002 He was my only brother.
###5004 And they killed him.
###5006 He ran down the hill with me before I went away.
###5010 He stood up there at the Lonesome Pine.
###5013 I never got to see him again.
###5017 I'm never going to see him again.
###5021 What are you doing here?
###5023 Why aren't you up there with Dave and Daddy?
###5026 You loved Buddie, didn't you?
###5028 You said you loved him.
###5031 He was gonna be an engineer.
###5033 Like you and Corsey.
###5037 When I tucked him in at night, he said,
###5041 "A is for apple, and I'll bet you I'll be as big as Mr. Hale."
###5047 What are you doing here?
###5049 June.
###5051 You're down here with the law!
###5053 The law's gonna help you!
###5054 The laws gonna show you how it don't hurt.
###5057 When somebody you love...
###5059 When somebody you love...
###5060 Oh, June, darling, don't cry.
###5061 You mustn't cry. Listen to me, dear.
###5064 I love you, and...
###5068 You love me?
###5071 You said you loved Buddie.
###5073 Why aren't you with Buddie?
###5075 Why aren't you where they need you?
###5078 You're here with the law.
###5080 You don't love me!
###5081 Well, I do with all of my heart.
###5083 You never said you love me before and I was hungry to hear it.
###5088 You said you love Buddie.
###5090 But you ain't doing nothing about it!
###5092 You ain't fighting! You ain't killing!
###5095 That's what's coming to them! The Falins!
###5101 This is what you wanted me to be, ain't it?
###5103 Pretty, nice words, hollow words!
###5106 I don't want it!
###5107 I don't want you! I don't want anything!
###5110 I don't want anything but the Falins!
###5139 Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.
###5143 Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth
###5146 as it is in Heaven.
###5148 Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses
###5152 as we forgive those who trespass against us.
###5156 Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
###5161 For thine is the power and the glory forever and ever.
###5166 Amen.

###5317 There's just about eight of them, Judd.
###5320 Dominickers!
###5322 Looks like things is just born to the Tollivers.
###5325 Don't it, Melissa?
###5327 Sure seems.
###5330 What are we going to do?
###5331 What are we standing here for?
###5333 June, honey.
###5334 I'm not just gonna stand around any longer.
###5336 Be sensible.
###5347 Before green-up time, Dave.
###5348 That's what you want, isn't it?
###5355 You mean it?
###5356 It's gotta be somebody who acts like a Tolliver.
###5360 Is that what it's going to be?
###5373 Dave, I don't want you to go.
###5375 I ain't hating the Falins. I ain't hating nobody.
###5378 I ain't grieving for Buddie.
###5380 June's my sorrow now.
###5382 I don't want to go on hating.
###5384 Don't go, David.
###5388 Dave... Wait a minute.
###5390 Dave, you're not going to let him... Dave, listen.
###5392 You can't do this thing. You've got green-up time to think about.
###5396 You'll be getting married, then.
###5398 Now you're going out and run the risk of being killed.
###5400 Hasn't there been enough unhappiness in this house?
###5402 You ain't a Tolliver.
###5403 You're an outsider.
###5404 Yes. Well, none of you could have
###5405 loved little Buddie any better than I did.
###5407 And he was killed because I taught him to love the things I did.
###5410 It was my fault.
###5412 And this matter of getting even is gonna be my business.
###5415 It's gonna be my business until I've cleaned out every Falin
###5417 that had anything to do with it.
###5423 Jack! Jack!
###5439 Dave.
###5441 I didn't want him to go.
###5442 I wouldn't have let you go, either.
###5445 I would have stopped you.
###5448 I only said those things 'cause I was hurt inside.
###5453 I could've stopped you.
###5455 But he's different.
###5457 He's not like a brother.
###5460 He'll never come back.
###5463 He'll never wanna come back.
###5467 Dave.
###5470 Stop him.
###5471 Tell him what I can't.
###5475 Please, Dave.
###5499 You ain't going to no Falins.
###5500 No? Well, you try and stop me.
###5502 You're looking for trouble, Mr. Hale, the mountains is full of it.
###5539 We're all brave men.
###5541 Falins are brave men.
###5544 You killed the children.
###5545 I didn't know.
###5547 It's done now.
###5549 Sometime, I'll wanna go downtown.
###5551 People, they'll look at me.
###5554 Maybe when I ain't around, they'll call me Herod.
###5559 Herod Falin.
###5562 They might call me that.
###5564 He was a fellow that done that once.
###5566 He killed babies.
###5568 The kid was a Tolliver, wasn't he?
###5569 You're kind of forgetting about Jim, ain't you?
###5571 I ain't forgetting nothing.
###5573 Jim told me, in my arms, he was hiding behind the bushes
###5576 trying to pick off Dave Tolliver,
###5578 and Dave couldn't see who he was shooting at.
###5581 Buddie Tolliver couldn't say that.
###5584 I don't like him and I ain't gonna like him.
###5587 I get my hands on that Dave Tolliver...
###5593 Who's that?
###5595 Dave Tolliver.
###5604 What are you here for?
###5606 I wanna talk to you.
###5607 And I ain't carry no gun.
###5621 Come on in.
###5631 If I tell you... If I tell you we're licked, will you stop fighting?
###5636 Who's licked?
###5637 Who do you mean? Me.
###5640 You ain't licked.
###5643 You couldn't be licked.
###5646 Why did you come here?
###5648 Why? Yeah.
###5650 Why shouldn't I come to you?
###5652 I ought to have dragged myself through all the brambles,
###5655 all the way from here up to your house,
###5656 and say, "I'm sorry."
###5661 But I just ain't got the sand.
###5665 You ain't my father.
###5667 You're a sniveling pup!
###5669 I've been like that.
###5673 Maybe that's what's the trouble.
###5676 You wanna shake hands?
###5683 Now, tell me, why did you do it?
###5692 It was Aunt Melissa's birthday...
###5728 For a minute I thought you meant it.
###5740 I did. I did!
###5780 Dave, what happened?
###5784 I fell on my gun.
###5789 Buck Falin was passing.
###5791 He was good enough to fetch me home.
###5808 Dave.
###5813 If you don't mind, can I...
###5816 Can I stay till...
###5819 Sure.
###5829 It's of no use, Jack.
###5832 You can't cut this enough.
###5835 Dave.
