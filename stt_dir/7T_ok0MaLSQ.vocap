###0 
###0 MARGE PHELPS: Forget all the rest of the scripture.
###1 Just think logically.
###3 It's delusional.
###4 These people are delusional.
###6 It's like they're all mentally ill.
###9 You turned this country over to the fags.
###11 You did it aggressively.
###12 You did it proactively.
###13 You did it in 1,000 different ways.
###16 Now we're coming home in body bags.
###18 
###31 FRED PHELPS: It is my opinion that the news media is totally
###34 corrupt and totally--
###36 I mean totally--
###38 dedicated to the militant fag agenda.
###41 
###47 LIBBY ALVAREZ: This guy was spitting on me and they
###49 knocked me down.
###52 I may have been 10 or something.
###54 SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: Judge not less you be judged, you
###56 blankity blanking blah, blah, blah that says, blah, blah.
###60 To which I have to say, [INAUDIBLE] stop judging us.
###64 STEVE DRAIN: All these do-gooder, lying-ass
###68 Christians.
###70 FRED PHELPS: Break these signs out in some public place.
###75 Display them, and it will only be a matter of minutes, if not
###79 seconds, before the same kind of vicious fag
###83 attack, we call it.
###85 Fag attack.
###86 Fag attack.
###87 
###91 DENISE HALL: I think when you have that kind of hate speech
###93 against any one particular group, other people are going
###95 to sit back and say, wow, that's really
###97 going over the top.
###99 
###102 MALE SPEAKER: You should be burned at the stake.
###106 MALE SPEAKER: You filthy, rotten, scum-sucking pig,
###109 [INAUDIBLE] you're going to hell.
###111 
###115 MARGE PHELPS: And this thing's going in waves now.
###117 We go out and tell them, they respond by aggressively
###122 rejecting the message.
###123 MALE SPEAKER: They're pathetic.
###124 You people are pathetic.
###126 MARGE PHELPS: You know know who claims to be the most
###127 Christian in this country nowadays?
###128 The veterans and the politicians.
###132 That's why they're the ones who fight us the hardest.
###134 
###143 MALE SPEAKER: OK, now, hey, guys.
###146 [INAUDIBLE].
###148 
###152 TIM PHELPS: I remember I think the worst one I went to was
###154 either that weekend that I left in 2007--
###158 my birthday present was to go to Washington, DC, for the
###162 Veterans' Day parade.
###163 And so I was there and that was kind of crazy.
###166 They chased us away when they're all down listening to
###169 the speech and they all come up the hill
###170 and we're right there.
###171 And we're right at the corner when the parade turns around.
###175 And we were kind of trapped there on the corner.
###177 And we tried to jump.
###179 I had two of the younger kids like this.
###182 I'm shielding them or whatever.
###183 And so we tried to hop the barrier.
###187 And the cops pulled out there batons, like, get back over,
###190 get back over.
###191 DENISE HALL: They're not asking
###192 anybody to hurt anybody.
###194 They're saying things that we can all find terrible, but
###199 they're not saying, let's go kill gay people.
###203 NARRATOR: During our time with the Westboro Baptist Church,
###205 we found it increasingly difficult to reconcile their
###208 hate speech with how well they treated us.
###210 But the one thing we had to keep reminding ourselves was
###212 that, to them, we were nothing more than another platform to
###215 spread their message.
###217 DENISE HALL: For those of us who live here and have lived
###220 here for a long time, we can just drive by and go, OK,
###224 that's Fred.
###225 It's just such a shock to people in other cities that
###228 think, does everybody in Topeka feel like this?
###231 And would everybody in Topeka get behind
###233 something like this?
###234 And, no, of course, we wouldn't .
###239 GRUMPY: Anti-gays, anti-America--
###242 you name it, he's against it.
###243 MALE SPEAKER: Have a good evening.
###245 GRUMPY: I know personally a child who died of AIDS because
###250 of a blood transmission.
###252 They picketed that child's funeral.
###255 That [INAUDIBLE].
###260 DENISE HALL: Ted's kind of--
###261 there are good people in this town that are trying to make
###264 the town grow and make it look interesting.
###266 And then you have to think, oh well, you get some company in
###269 from somewhere, and how much does that hurt if they happen
###272 to drive by a bunch of picketers and think, huh,
###275 should we move our families and our company to Topeka?
###279 Hm.
###279 Well, let's see.
###280 Maybe we'll go to Omaha.
###283 STEVE DRAIN: I'm much more fearful of neglecting my duty
###291 to my children to teach them what the Lord requires of them
###294 than I am not having some fleshly relationship with
###299 them, besides which, when we talk about kids growing up
###302 that become adults, you don't hang out with people who don't
###307 like the same kind of stuff you like or do the
###309 same kind of you do.
###310 Everybody gravitates toward people with common interests.
###314 NARRATOR: Steve's daughters, Lauren and Taylor, were
###316 brought into the Westboro fold as adolescents.
###318 Upon their arrival, the Drains sharply changed their approach
###321 to parenting--
###322 no Christmas, no Halloween, no Thanksgiving, no more rock
###326 bands, no more haircuts for the girls, no more chocolate
###329 bunnies, or even What Would Jesus Do? bracelets, and above
###333 all, no boys.
###335 TAYLOR DRAIN: God says to warn them for him.
###337 These people don't obey him.
###338 They don't keep his commandments.
###340 
###353 STEVE DRAIN: Taylor, she actually cut a music video not
###355 too long ago.
###357 She's a senior at Washburn University now.
###359 You understand, she studies computer information systems,
###362 but she likes the the look and feel side of that.
###366 So for instance, godhatesthemedia.com--
###369 that's basically her website.
###370 She put it together.
###371 Taylor also does the WBC video news a couple times a week.
###375 It usually has been [INAUDIBLE]
###377 Pastor Phelps.
###378 But here recently, some of the other elder men have been
###381 breaking out and starting to do some talking.
###383 And Taylor she switches that.
###385 She's got a little switcher in there, in the studio.
###387 And she posts it herself and sticks it up there.
###390 So it's pretty cool.
###391 TIM PHELPS: Taylor, she was kind of quiet.
###393 Truthfully, I'm surprised that she's there, because I thought
###396 that she was kind of attached to some of those boys that
###402 left in her grade.
###403 I don't know.
###404 And her sister--
###405 I thought she was attached to her sister.
###407 NARRATOR: Well into the second hour of our interview, we
###410 noticed that Steve was still hesitant to discuss the one
###412 topic on both of our minds--
###414 his daughter Lauren.
###416 STEVE DRAIN: These are kids for a while, and then they're
###418 adults for a long time.
###420 And when they're adults, when they come to that age--
###423 the age where they have a moral responsibility for
###427 themselves--
###428 at least I'll know this.
###429 At least I'll know that I did my duty to them.
###432 Because my life isn't about pleasing myself.
###436 My life isn't about pleasing my children.
###438 My life is about serving my Lord.
###440 
###443 LIBBY ALVAREZ: She never was a true believer.
###447 You don't even want to get me started on this girl.
###449 She always wanted to go out with boys.
###452 I know that I have people-- even after all that's left--
###455 come up to me and tell me how she would take clothes to
###458 school and change into them that were inappropriate.
###463 She snuck out all the time with a guy from Topeka High
###466 and did stuff with him.
###467 TIM PHELPS: Then she got caught because
###468 she had a flat tire.
###468 LIBBY ALVAREZ: She got a flat tire and she got caught.
###470 NARRATOR: Lauren Drain was expelled from the Westboro
###472 Baptist Church in 2007.
###474 She has been allowed no contact with her mother and
###477 two younger siblings, Boaz and Faith.
###479 STEVE DRAIN: I haven't spoken to her probably in I'm going
###484 to say three years.
###485 I'm not really sure.
###486 But I think probably three years since
###488 I've spoken to her.
###489 She's a grown woman now.
###491 It's way different than when you're a little kid.
###495 When I have these little kids, they're looking to Dad for
###499 some guidance.
###500 And I tell them, look, this is what the scripture says here.
###505 This is the standard that we have in this house.
###506 But now, she's is a grown woman.
###509 First time I go to telling her that what she's doing is
###511 wrong, she's going to tell me to take a long
###512 walk on a short pier.
###514 LIBBY ALVAREZ: I'll tell you what happened.
###515 There was this guy--
###516 I was responsible on YouTube to put up videos.
###518 And so I was doing that.
###519 So this guy started talking to me.
###521 And then Lauren started putting
###522 up videos or something.
###523 I don't know why she was on there.
###523 Then she started talking to this guy.
###525 And this guy was trying to flirt with us, OK?
###527 So apparently, she was--
###530 TIM PHELPS: Corresponding.
###530 LIBBY ALVAREZ: Yeah, she was corresponding with him.
###532 And she ended up stealing her mother's credit card--
###535 TIM PHELPS: Bought a plane ticket.
###536 LIBBY ALVAREZ: --and bought a plane ticket for
###537 him to come to Kansas.
###540 STEVE DRAIN: Look, she's not a country mile from a
###543 Bible-believing Christian, I can tell you right now.
###545 She lives with a man.
###546 
###549 She lives with a man.
###552 She's not married to him.
###553 
###556 It's kind of the fundamental deal right there.
###558 NARRATOR: As we looked around the Drain family home, we
###561 noticed that not a single picture of
###562 Lauren Drain remained.
###564 She had been erased, as if she never existed.
###568 STEVE DRAIN: Thankfully, the Lord has been merciful to me.
###571 He's given me children that I didn't even have
###573 when I came up here.
###575 No, he gave me Bo and Faith after we
###576 even were living here.
###579 I got an eight-year-old daughter who knows more Bible
###582 than a good chunk of preachers in Topeka, Kansas.
###587 BOAZ DRAIN: Faith, you always look weird, so it doesn't
###589 really-- you can't tell the difference.
###592 FAITH DRAIN: Shut up.
###593 STEVE DRAIN: Yeah, she called me on my birthday.
###595 I think it was about three years ago.
###596 She called me and she was very cheerful.
###600 And she said, you were right about everything you tried to
###604 tell me, Dad.
###606 And then she hung up.
###607 And that was the last I've heard from her.
###610 NARRATOR: While she did provide us with pictures and
###612 this video, Lauren Drain did not grant Vice an interview.
###616 However, she did ask us to plug her book.
###619 It comes out in 2013.
###624 LIBBY ALVAREZ: The views were becoming more extreme.
###626 The main thing that I had a problem with was praying for a
###628 specific person to die.
###630 But since I had lived there my entire life and all that
###633 seemed normal to me--
###634 TIM PHELPS: You went went along with it.
###635 LIBBY ALVAREZ: Yeah, I went along with it.
###637 And I needed a personal breaking point, like something
###640 that happened just to me.
###641 And that happened when my family and I went on a
###646 vacation to Puerto Rico.
###648 We came back, my grandpa asked for pictures.
###650 So the one that I gave him-- and only good one--
###652 me and my sister happened to be wearing a bikini in it.
###656 They put out on a table so everyone going to church--
###659 my grandma and grandpa, they liked it.
###660 They put it out front so everyone could look at it.
###662 After church, I walked out there and I saw the picture
###664 had been moved way to the back.
###665 And I just thought, oh, crap.
###667 Something bad's going to happen.
###669 STEVE DRAIN: There aren't any other options in life.
###670 You either warn the wicked or you don't warn the wicked.
###673 You warn the righteous or you don't warn the righteous.
###677 LIBBY ALVAREZ: We had these meetings.
###678 I had been to them with other people.
###680 And I mean, I know how nervous I got there.
###682 And then it was my turn for a meeting.
###684 There's about 30 people around you in a big rectangle.
###688 TIM PHELPS: It's like a verbal stoning.
###689 LIBBY ALVAREZ: Exactly.
###690 That's exactly what is, a verbal stoning.
###692 Everyone, they were saying I don't help out enough.
###695 And then his dad said that I was chaff and that the wind
###699 was going to come and blow me away.
###701 And it's just like, sitting there listening to all this,
###704 you obviously don't want me here.
###706 It actually opened my eyes a lot.
###708 So every time I get sad sometimes about leaving and
###710 missing my family, I think about that, because they are
###714 not the honest, hard-working people that I
###715 thought that they were.
###717 
###720 Sorry.
###722 
###725 Everyone kept calling me and they were telling me, stop
###728 dishonoring your parents.
###729 Another one said, you need to quit your job.
###731 Then, my grandpa called.
###733 He said, you're not thinking about leaving, are you?
###734 And then I said, no.
###736 And in that moment, I was telling the truth, because I
###738 didn't think I could leave.
###740 I didn't think that was an option for me to leave.
###743 I just kind of had a sudden realization that I needed to
###746 get out there.
###749 It just overpowered me that I needed to leave.
###751 The opportunity presented itself.
###753 I had to do it, or it wasn't going to happen.
###756 
###759 My dad called and I didn't answer it.
###761 He left a message, and I listened to it.
###763 
###768 He said, I hope you're having a good day, and everything
###770 will be fine.
###771 You just need to talk to everyone.
###774 And we can get this result.
###778 But I knew that that wasn't going to happen.
###780 
###789 And then I left.
###790 
###797 Shirley sent me an email.
###798 And she said, your mom and your dad and your sister want
###802 no communication with you.
###805 Remember earlier, when I said it was an unspoken rule that
###807 you can't talk to them?
###808 So there, I still have that it writing.
###810 
###816 TIM PHELPS: Tara and James--
###819 LIBBY ALVAREZ: Marie, Josh, you, Hez-
###823 TIM PHELPS: Michael, David.
###824 LIBBY ALVAREZ: Oh, yeah.
###824 Forgot about them.
###826 TIM PHELPS: Mechiah.
###826 LIBBY ALVAREZ: Oh, yeah.
###829 TIM PHELPS: Josh Phelps.
###830 LIBBY ALVAREZ: Oh, yeah.
###831 Geez.
###831 TIM PHELPS: We can't find him.
###832 LIBBY ALVAREZ: Yeah.
###834 TIM PHELPS: From our generation.
###835 There's obviously Kate and Carl, Teresa, Bill, and Mary.
###839 LIBBY ALVAREZ: Yeah, there's older ones that left, too.
###843 Well, I still have problems, especially when I see a
###846 homosexual couple.
###848 I still am just like, oh, man.
###851 What's going on over there?
###853 TIM PHELPS: The only thing I have a problem with, I guess--
###855 I learned pretty quick how to be able to manipulate my way
###859 through stuff.
###861 LIBBY ALVAREZ: I don't know how to do that.
###863 TIM PHELPS: I usually don't even use my last name
###864 unless I have to.
###866 Not that I'm ashamed of it, but that I don't want to be
###869 judged is, I guess, the word I could use, on--
###871 LIBBY ALVAREZ: Yeah, exactly.
###873 TIM PHELPS: I went into an interview the other day.
###876 I was looking for a second job.
###877 And I went into the interview, and he goes, Tim
###879 Phelps, from Topeka?
###880 I'm not even going to ask you.
###881 LIBBY ALVAREZ: Oh, god.
###882 TIM PHELPS: And I was like, you can if you want.
###884 And he's like, you know what question I was going to ask.
###886 And then he didn't ask it.
###888 LIBBY ALVAREZ: You should have said something.
###889 TIM PHELPS: It's not a big deal.
###890 No, I just let him do his interview.
###892 LIBBY ALVAREZ: Oh, that's weird.
###894 If you don't get it, it's because he probably thinks
###895 that you're still there.
###896 I'm just kidding.
###896 TIM PHELPS: Well, I guess I could have been.
###898 But I don't care.
###899 LIBBY ALVAREZ: Yeah.
###901 FRED PHELPS: Try to stop us!
###902 
###917 STEVE DRAIN: I'm having this interview with you.
###919 And you know, we hit it off pretty well.
###921 But it's your vocation to be interested in fringe
###927 personalities.
###928 
###941 Imagine being good friends with me.
###943 We're not going to be bowling buddies.
###945 We're just not going to.
###946
