0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,47
EDDIE HUANG: Somebody's gotta
get pregnant on this show.


2
0:0:2,47 --> 0:0:2,964
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Pregnant?


3
0:0:2,964 --> 0:0:4,446
EDDIE HUANG: Somebody's
gotta get pregnant.


4
0:0:4,446 --> 0:0:6,917
This is the somebody--
did he tell you?


5
0:0:6,917 --> 0:0:8,408
This is Vice Media.


6
0:0:8,408 --> 0:0:10,396
Somebody's gotta get pregnant.


7
0:0:10,396 --> 0:0:11,887
We go to different ethnic


8
0:0:11,887 --> 0:0:14,372
neighborhoods, and we make babies.


9
0:0:14,372 --> 0:0:15,366
That's what we do.


10
0:0:15,366 --> 0:0:16,36
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: You'd
have a cute baby.


11
0:0:16,36 --> 0:0:17,354
Cute baby.


12
0:0:17,354 --> 0:0:17,651
EDDIE HUANG: Cute.


13
0:0:17,651 --> 0:0:19,342
I mean, that could be a baby.


14
0:0:19,342 --> 0:0:20,62
I could see this baby.


15
0:0:20,62 --> 0:0:22,25
10 points.


16
0:0:22,25 --> 0:0:23,72
There we go.


17
0:0:23,72 --> 0:0:44,67
[MUSIC PLAYING]


18
0:0:44,67 --> 0:0:47,9
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, I was mad
excited about Persian LA.


19
0:0:47,9 --> 0:0:49,8
Came out here, thought I'd run
into the Iron Sheik at the


20
0:0:49,8 --> 0:0:53,71
grocery store, cop some
plutonium on the corner, catch


21
0:0:53,71 --> 0:0:55,3
an afternoon saffron
rainstorm.


22
0:0:55,3 --> 0:1:5,74



23
0:1:5,74 --> 0:1:7,25
What's up?


24
0:1:7,25 --> 0:1:10,71
All right, so when you lost
in Persian LA, head to the


25
0:1:10,71 --> 0:1:13,83
fucking rug store, find your
neighborhood friendly Persian.


26
0:1:13,83 --> 0:1:16,12
This is Nima Nabavi,
world famous.


27
0:1:16,12 --> 0:1:17,11
NIMA NABAVI: Pleasure.


28
0:1:17,11 --> 0:1:19,4
EDDIE HUANG: Thank you for
showing us around this


29
0:1:19,4 --> 0:1:20,29
neighborhood.


30
0:1:20,29 --> 0:1:23,86



31
0:1:23,86 --> 0:1:26,85
So what is it that makes Persian
rugs so special?


32
0:1:26,85 --> 0:1:29,64
NIMA NABAVI: The main thing is
a lot of them take like 10


33
0:1:29,64 --> 0:1:30,82
years to make.


34
0:1:30,82 --> 0:1:31,46
EDDIE HUANG: One rug?


35
0:1:31,46 --> 0:1:32,7
NIMA NABAVI: Yeah, one rug.


36
0:1:32,7 --> 0:1:34,54
EDDIE HUANG: So this was
a dude's decade?


37
0:1:34,54 --> 0:1:36,13
How much is one of these?


38
0:1:36,13 --> 0:1:38,46
NIMA NABAVI: Honestly, if this
was under 25 grand, I'd be


39
0:1:38,46 --> 0:1:39,4
kind of surprised.


40
0:1:39,4 --> 0:1:40,17
EDDIE HUANG: This is a car.


41
0:1:40,17 --> 0:1:41,21
NIMA NABAVI: We'll ask them.


42
0:1:41,21 --> 0:1:42,21
EDDIE HUANG: This is college.


43
0:1:42,21 --> 0:1:42,74
NIMA NABAVI: Yeah.


44
0:1:42,74 --> 0:1:43,11
EDDIE HUANG: Wow.


45
0:1:43,11 --> 0:1:44,42
NIMA NABAVI: This
is a big deal.


46
0:1:44,42 --> 0:1:47,21
EDDIE HUANG: I'ma get on this
rug game, because a lot of


47
0:1:47,21 --> 0:1:49,45
people got the sneaker
game, the cars.


48
0:1:49,45 --> 0:1:50,69
NIMA NABAVI: The rug game's
where it's at, man.


49
0:1:50,69 --> 0:1:51,56
EDDIE HUANG: Wanna
be futuristic


50
0:1:51,56 --> 0:1:52,91
with your pimp game?


51
0:1:52,91 --> 0:1:53,12
Rugs.


52
0:1:53,12 --> 0:1:54,45
Persian rugs.


53
0:1:54,45 --> 0:1:55,25
Are those peacocks?


54
0:1:55,25 --> 0:1:56,79
Or phoenix?


55
0:1:56,79 --> 0:1:58,13
What bird is-- what
is like the bird?


56
0:1:58,13 --> 0:1:59,1
NIMA NABAVI: They're big cocks,
because that's what


57
0:1:59,1 --> 0:1:59,815
we're known for.


58
0:1:59,815 --> 0:2:0,83
EDDIE HUANG: Oh wow.


59
0:2:0,83 --> 0:2:1,88
Pause.


60
0:2:1,88 --> 0:2:3,89
So this is like a car
dealership, like somebody


61
0:2:3,89 --> 0:2:6,97
sells a rug, like a $25,000
rug, that's their month?


62
0:2:6,97 --> 0:2:7,37
NIMA NABAVI: Yeah.


63
0:2:7,37 --> 0:2:9,1
EDDIE HUANG: They don't got no
doughnuts in here, though, no


64
0:2:9,1 --> 0:2:10,0
doughnuts and coffee?


65
0:2:10,0 --> 0:2:12,28
NIMA NABAVI: Naw, they
got baklava and tea.


66
0:2:12,28 --> 0:2:14,41
EDDIE HUANG: What is the food in
this neighborhood, though?


67
0:2:14,41 --> 0:2:16,5
NIMA NABAVI: I mean, generally,
the stereotype is


68
0:2:16,5 --> 0:2:18,303
kebab and rice and all
that, which is dope.


69
0:2:18,303 --> 0:2:18,99
EDDIE HUANG: I seen it.


70
0:2:18,99 --> 0:2:21,25
NIMA NABAVI: But I want to take
you to this spot that is


71
0:2:21,25 --> 0:2:22,1
a sandwich spot.


72
0:2:22,1 --> 0:2:27,67
[MUSIC PLAYING]


73
0:2:27,67 --> 0:2:29,885
NIMA NABAVI: This area is
officially Persian Square, and


74
0:2:29,885 --> 0:2:32,38
they picked this spot because
the sandwich shop we're about


75
0:2:32,38 --> 0:2:35,57
to go to is the first Persian
establishment in the area.


76
0:2:35,57 --> 0:2:35,9
EDDIE HUANG: Nice.


77
0:2:35,9 --> 0:2:38,19
NIMA NABAVI: So, been
around since '74, so


78
0:2:38,19 --> 0:2:39,44
let's go peep it out.


79
0:2:39,44 --> 0:2:45,88



80
0:2:45,88 --> 0:2:47,47
EDDIE HUANG: They got the
brain out on front


81
0:2:47,47 --> 0:2:48,78
street, you see this?


82
0:2:48,78 --> 0:2:50,87
What kind of brain is
that, cow brain?


83
0:2:50,87 --> 0:2:51,63
NIMA NABAVI: Sheep.


84
0:2:51,63 --> 0:2:53,5
EDDIE HUANG: I think you should
hit the brain, I'm


85
0:2:53,5 --> 0:2:53,655
gonna get the tongue.


86
0:2:53,655 --> 0:2:54,83
NIMA NABAVI: Try a little
bit, though.


87
0:2:54,83 --> 0:2:56,12
EDDIE HUANG: I'll try
a little bit.


88
0:2:56,12 --> 0:3:3,23



89
0:3:3,23 --> 0:3:4,19
WAITRESS: Here's your brain.


90
0:3:4,19 --> 0:3:6,71
NIMA NABAVI: That's the brains,
and two tongues.


91
0:3:6,71 --> 0:3:9,95
WAITRESS: Yes.


92
0:3:9,95 --> 0:3:9,53
NIMA NABAVI: What
do you think?


93
0:3:9,53 --> 0:3:10,28
EDDIE HUANG: Delicious.


94
0:3:10,28 --> 0:3:10,66
Tender.


95
0:3:10,66 --> 0:3:11,88
NIMA NABAVI: Yeah, right?


96
0:3:11,88 --> 0:3:13,88
EDDIE HUANG: This tongue feels
like I'm at Second


97
0:3:13,88 --> 0:3:14,74
Avenue Deli, man.


98
0:3:14,74 --> 0:3:16,52
Like really, really juicy.


99
0:3:16,52 --> 0:3:16,945
NIMA NABAVI: Legit, right?


100
0:3:16,945 --> 0:3:17,37
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.


101
0:3:17,37 --> 0:3:20,17
And the pickles, these types
of pickles that you get in


102
0:3:20,17 --> 0:3:22,8
like Lebanese food,
Persian food.


103
0:3:22,8 --> 0:3:28,89
It's like the tarter, sour,
funky, thin pickles.


104
0:3:28,89 --> 0:3:30,3
NIMA NABAVI: You know,
it's almost time


105
0:3:30,3 --> 0:3:31,28
for the brain, right?


106
0:3:31,28 --> 0:3:33,81



107
0:3:33,81 --> 0:3:35,54
EDDIE HUANG: You first, kid.


108
0:3:35,54 --> 0:3:37,1
You know what brain
looks like to me?


109
0:3:37,1 --> 0:3:38,49
It's like mammal oysters.


110
0:3:38,49 --> 0:3:38,98
NIMA NABAVI: It really is.


111
0:3:38,98 --> 0:3:40,63
EDDIE HUANG: Not even
gonna front.


112
0:3:40,63 --> 0:3:41,755
I do it for y'all.


113
0:3:41,755 --> 0:3:43,75
NIMA NABAVI: You'll only be
eating brain sandwiches for


114
0:3:43,75 --> 0:3:44,15
the rest of your life.


115
0:3:44,15 --> 0:3:45,4
Watch.


116
0:3:45,4 --> 0:3:49,1



117
0:3:49,1 --> 0:3:49,4
EDDIE HUANG: Here's the
thing, this is it


118
0:3:49,4 --> 0:3:50,87
with all the gag foods.


119
0:3:50,87 --> 0:3:53,79
I have no problem eating it--
sweetbreads, whatever.


120
0:3:53,79 --> 0:3:56,13
My thing is just it's never,
like, amazing.


121
0:3:56,13 --> 0:3:56,44
NIMA NABAVI: That's
what I'm saying.


122
0:3:56,44 --> 0:3:57,52
EDDIE HUANG: It's
never eventful.


123
0:3:57,52 --> 0:3:58,82
I'm like, this is all hype.


124
0:3:58,82 --> 0:4:2,92
And that's why I don't bug
out over freak food.


125
0:4:2,92 --> 0:4:5,92
NIMA NABAVI: Well, a lot of
it, too, is a lot of these


126
0:4:5,92 --> 0:4:6,47
cultures, it was really like--


127
0:4:6,47 --> 0:4:7,28
EDDIE HUANG: They enjoy it.


128
0:4:7,28 --> 0:4:8,53
NIMA NABAVI: Well, it's
not even that.


129
0:4:8,53 --> 0:4:11,27
It's like, we kill the sheep,
and we eat every part of it.


130
0:4:11,27 --> 0:4:15,23
Like, my dad will come here
and swear he loves it.


131
0:4:15,23 --> 0:4:16,29
EDDIE HUANG: What
do you got next?


132
0:4:16,29 --> 0:4:17,779
NIMA NABAVI: Yo, next up, we're
gonna go have some real


133
0:4:17,779 --> 0:4:18,75
Persian ice cream, man.


134
0:4:18,75 --> 0:4:19,14
EDDIE HUANG: Dope.


135
0:4:19,14 --> 0:4:21,35
NIMA NABAVI: Some real, real
shit you've never tried.


136
0:4:21,35 --> 0:4:22,133
EDDIE HUANG: Persian
ice cream shop.


137
0:4:22,133 --> 0:4:22,617
I'm ready, kid.


138
0:4:22,617 --> 0:4:23,867
NIMA NABAVI: Alright, man.


139
0:4:23,867 --> 0:4:28,92



140
0:4:28,92 --> 0:4:29,31
EDDIE HUANG: I see
the saffron.


141
0:4:29,31 --> 0:4:31,5
I'm getting saffron,
I already decided.


142
0:4:31,5 --> 0:4:32,7
NIMA NABAVI: Did you?


143
0:4:32,7 --> 0:4:32,93
EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.


144
0:4:32,93 --> 0:4:35,37
All right, we'll try this
frozen, high fiber sorbet.


145
0:4:35,37 --> 0:4:36,28
NIMA NABAVI: There ya go.


146
0:4:36,28 --> 0:4:38,53
EDDIE HUANG: Can I do it with
the flavors, like I put


147
0:4:38,53 --> 0:4:39,8
together or not?


148
0:4:39,8 --> 0:4:39,938
ICE CREAM SERVER: Oh
yeah, that's how it


149
0:4:39,938 --> 0:4:41,286
comes is this way.


150
0:4:41,286 --> 0:4:42,65
EDDIE HUANG: Oh, good.


151
0:4:42,65 --> 0:4:44,32
Are a lot of Persians
lactose intolerant?


152
0:4:44,32 --> 0:4:44,98
NIMA NABAVI: Yup.


153
0:4:44,98 --> 0:4:47,28
EDDIE HUANG: Because that
is an epidemic in my


154
0:4:47,28 --> 0:4:47,92
neighborhood--


155
0:4:47,92 --> 0:4:49,6
the milk farters.


156
0:4:49,6 --> 0:4:51,28
Lot of milk farters
in Chinatown.


157
0:4:51,28 --> 0:4:52,0
Thank you, sir.


158
0:4:52,0 --> 0:4:53,46
NIMA NABAVI: Thank
you, [FARSI].


159
0:4:53,46 --> 0:4:55,375
Oh, you're going to grow
a unibrow right now.


160
0:4:55,375 --> 0:4:59,49



161
0:4:59,49 --> 0:5:1,48
EDDIE HUANG: I think my
dick just got bigger.


162
0:5:1,48 --> 0:5:3,59
This is like y'all's
shark's fin.


163
0:5:3,59 --> 0:5:3,91
NIMA NABAVI: Yeah.


164
0:5:3,91 --> 0:5:5,216
EDDIE HUANG: You know
what I mean?


165
0:5:5,216 --> 0:5:7,726
Score 1,500, grandpa will
take you out for


166
0:5:7,726 --> 0:5:8,556
some saffron ice cream.


167
0:5:8,556 --> 0:5:10,5
NIMA NABAVI: There ya go.


168
0:5:10,5 --> 0:5:15,2
EDDIE HUANG: Yo, so we ate
sandwiches, we looked at rugs.


169
0:5:15,2 --> 0:5:15,5
NIMA NABAVI: True.


170
0:5:15,5 --> 0:5:17,62
EDDIE HUANG: We ate ice cream.


171
0:5:17,62 --> 0:5:18,37
NIMA NABAVI: Yes, sir.


172
0:5:18,37 --> 0:5:19,67
EDDIE HUANG: How would
a Persian end this?


173
0:5:19,67 --> 0:5:21,246
NIMA NABAVI: Definitely gotta
have some hookah.


174
0:5:21,246 --> 0:5:21,68
EDDIE HUANG: OK.


175
0:5:21,68 --> 0:5:23,36
NIMA NABAVI: So there's
a spot up here, it's


176
0:5:23,36 --> 0:5:25,25
called Habibi Cafe.


177
0:5:25,25 --> 0:5:27,115
We should go up there, meet some
homies, and fucking get


178
0:5:27,115 --> 0:5:28,2
some smoking.


179
0:5:28,2 --> 0:5:29,27
EDDIE HUANG: OK.


180
0:5:29,27 --> 0:5:38,135



181
0:5:38,135 --> 0:5:40,45
Eddie, nice to meet you.


182
0:5:40,45 --> 0:5:40,92
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Edgar.


183
0:5:40,92 --> 0:5:41,73
EDDIE HUANG: Eddie.


184
0:5:41,73 --> 0:5:42,973
You're Edgar?


185
0:5:42,973 --> 0:5:44,36
You're Edgar.


186
0:5:44,36 --> 0:5:44,94
Amazing.


187
0:5:44,94 --> 0:5:45,32
Sexy.


188
0:5:45,32 --> 0:5:46,84
This is nice, I like this.


189
0:5:46,84 --> 0:5:50,5
I like this.


190
0:5:50,5 --> 0:5:51,24
Where're you from?


191
0:5:51,24 --> 0:5:51,91
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: We're
all Persian.


192
0:5:51,91 --> 0:5:53,23
EDDIE HUANG: All Persian.


193
0:5:53,23 --> 0:5:55,5
I'm glad you all came, because
otherwise, these Vice viewers


194
0:5:55,5 --> 0:5:57,15
would've thought all
Persians were dudes


195
0:5:57,15 --> 0:5:58,29
with unibrows, right?


196
0:5:58,29 --> 0:5:59,256
NIMA NABAVI: Yeah.


197
0:5:59,256 --> 0:6:0,506
EDDIE HUANG: Pretty much.


198
0:6:0,506 --> 0:6:7,95



199
0:6:7,95 --> 0:6:8,916
Oh wow.


200
0:6:8,916 --> 0:6:10,12
He did put milk in the base.


201
0:6:10,12 --> 0:6:11,73
NIMA NABAVI: I told you.


202
0:6:11,73 --> 0:6:14,13
EDDIE HUANG: Oh,
it's an apple.


203
0:6:14,13 --> 0:6:16,95
I did that in high school when
I couldn't buy pipes.


204
0:6:16,95 --> 0:6:20,38



205
0:6:20,38 --> 0:6:22,2
We were like, what
do Persians do?


206
0:6:22,2 --> 0:6:25,39
And he was like, meet me at the
rug shop, then we're going


207
0:6:25,39 --> 0:6:28,42
to go peep sandwiches, then
we're gonna eat ice cream.


208
0:6:28,42 --> 0:6:28,66
I was like, dude.


209
0:6:28,66 --> 0:6:29,848
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Ok, those are
three things I've never


210
0:6:29,848 --> 0:6:31,34
done in my life.


211
0:6:31,34 --> 0:6:32,685
EDDIE HUANG: We went
to Persian LA.


212
0:6:32,685 --> 0:6:35,77
It's like a good three to five
blocks, but it's really like a


213
0:6:35,77 --> 0:6:40,555
bookstore, a music store, an ice
cream shop, a rug shop, a


214
0:6:40,555 --> 0:6:41,95
sandwich shop.


215
0:6:41,95 --> 0:6:43,52
You know, a collection
of business is not


216
0:6:43,52 --> 0:6:44,98
necessarily a community.


217
0:6:44,98 --> 0:6:46,3
You need the people in there.


218
0:6:46,3 --> 0:6:48,35
You need the vigor, you need
the energy, you need the


219
0:6:48,35 --> 0:6:49,66
sounds, you need the flavors.


220
0:6:49,66 --> 0:6:52,62



221
0:6:52,62 --> 0:6:55,75
You wish that this culture
would plant their flag a


222
0:6:55,75 --> 0:6:57,63
little deeper in LA.


223
0:6:57,63 --> 0:7:5,61



224
0:7:5,61 --> 0:7:7,255
Next up on Fresh
off the Boat--


225
0:7:7,255 --> 0:7:11,154
MALE SPEAKER: This fucking
salsa is so spicy, yo.


226
0:7:11,154 --> 0:7:14,3
EDDIE HUANG: Dude, that chile
sauce is en fuego.


227
0:7:14,3 --> 0:7:15,16
I'm not doing that.


228
0:7:15,16 --> 0:7:18,76
My ass would be on fire
by like 7:00 PM.


229
0:7:18,76 --> 0:7:20,1
Oh my god.


230
0:7:20,1 --> 0:9:20,1
