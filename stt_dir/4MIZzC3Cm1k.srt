0:0:1,45 --> 0:0:5,58
STEVE SPANGLER: Welcome
to Toy Fair 2012.


3
0:0:5,58 --> 0:0:6,35
So look at this.


4
0:0:6,35 --> 0:0:7,95
God, that's amazing.


5
0:0:7,95 --> 0:0:10,65
Oh, and it doesn't take much
of a squeeze at all.


6
0:0:10,65 --> 0:0:11,945
You are now compressing
some of the air


7
0:0:11,945 --> 0:0:12,91
that's in that packet.


8
0:0:12,91 --> 0:0:14,543
So I bet you think this is the
part of the show where I'm


9
0:0:14,543 --> 0:0:17,3
going to say, don't try these
experiments at home.


10
0:0:17,3 --> 0:0:19,93
And you're right, except
there is one experiment


11
0:0:19,93 --> 0:0:20,65
we want you to try.


12
0:0:20,65 --> 0:0:22,36
Just look for the graphic
that's right here


13
0:0:22,36 --> 0:0:23,37
that says try it.


14
0:0:23,37 --> 0:0:25,29
That's your signal that
you can try that


15
0:0:25,29 --> 0:0:26,28
experiment at home.


16
0:0:26,28 --> 0:0:27,88
Everything else off limits.


17
0:0:27,88 --> 0:0:29,8
Look, I've already given you
homework, and the show hasn't


18
0:0:29,8 --> 0:0:31,67
even started.


19
0:0:31,67 --> 0:0:35,7
I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all
about making science fun.


20
0:0:35,7 --> 0:0:37,76
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


21
0:0:37,76 --> 0:0:40,77
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


22
0:0:40,77 --> 0:0:41,79
experiences.


23
0:0:41,79 --> 0:0:44,43
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


24
0:0:44,43 --> 0:0:47,18
affect the way people
think about science.


25
0:0:47,18 --> 0:0:49,43
And to do that, I live
by one motto--


26
0:0:49,43 --> 0:0:52,3
"Make it big, do it right, give


27
0:0:52,3 --> 0:0:58,56
it class." All right.


28
0:0:58,56 --> 0:0:59,8
Watch this.


29
0:0:59,8 --> 0:1:1,32
There's a squid in
the bottle--


30
0:1:1,32 --> 0:1:2,16
seriously.


31
0:1:2,16 --> 0:1:4,68
And you just take a hair like
this-- it's a trained squid--


32
0:1:4,68 --> 0:1:6,13
and you wrap the hair
around the squid.


33
0:1:6,13 --> 0:1:7,38
It's almost like a lasso.


34
0:1:7,38 --> 0:1:8,36
Hard to see.


35
0:1:8,36 --> 0:1:9,56
See I can kind of pull
the little--


36
0:1:9,56 --> 0:1:10,65
here let him go.


37
0:1:10,65 --> 0:1:12,86
Just grab the hair, pull
him down like this.


38
0:1:12,86 --> 0:1:14,93
And you can take him to the
bottom and just pull the hair


39
0:1:14,93 --> 0:1:17,88
off, and he'll go right back
up to the top, and--


40
0:1:17,88 --> 0:1:19,36
OK, that's not how it works.


41
0:1:19,36 --> 0:1:22,2
But it's the first science
toy I ever invented.


42
0:1:22,2 --> 0:1:25,1
And some people will ask, so how
does a science teacher own


43
0:1:25,1 --> 0:1:25,92
a toy company?


44
0:1:25,92 --> 0:1:29,0
And the reason why is because of
that dumb squid in a bottle


45
0:1:29,0 --> 0:1:31,48
that goes up and down when you
actually squeeze the bottle.


46
0:1:31,48 --> 0:1:32,24
This is it.


47
0:1:32,24 --> 0:1:35,42
It's the very, very first toy
that started the toy company.


48
0:1:35,42 --> 0:1:38,28
And it's nothing more than an
eye dropper and a hex nut and


49
0:1:38,28 --> 0:1:41,7
this little rubber piece
that's the squid.


50
0:1:41,7 --> 0:1:44,25
And let me show you how easy
it is to make the diver.


51
0:1:44,25 --> 0:1:45,91
Well, here are the pieces, parts
that we're using today.


52
0:1:45,91 --> 0:1:49,2
I've got just some 1 liter
bottles filled with water, a


53
0:1:49,2 --> 0:1:51,13
couple of deep containers,
because we're going to need to


54
0:1:51,13 --> 0:1:52,86
do some things that
sink and float.


55
0:1:52,86 --> 0:1:55,8
The original Cartesian
diver, named after


56
0:1:55,8 --> 0:1:57,74
Rene Descartes, used--


57
0:1:57,74 --> 0:2:0,13
well, the original one, I'm sure
used something other than


58
0:2:0,13 --> 0:2:1,6
glass eye droppers.


59
0:2:1,6 --> 0:2:4,83
The oldest one I can remember
used a glass eye dropper.


60
0:2:4,83 --> 0:2:7,59
And today, you can still find
them at stores like Walmart or


61
0:2:7,59 --> 0:2:8,94
wherever, a pharmacy.


62
0:2:8,94 --> 0:2:11,13
Let me show you how to do it
with the original one.


63
0:2:11,13 --> 0:2:11,97
The whole idea is this.


64
0:2:11,97 --> 0:2:14,49
You have to get a container of
water like this here, and you


65
0:2:14,49 --> 0:2:16,48
drop the eye dropper inside.


66
0:2:16,48 --> 0:2:19,13
And you say float or sink, and,
of course, it floats.


67
0:2:19,13 --> 0:2:21,92
And it floats because there's
air inside that eye dropper.


68
0:2:21,92 --> 0:2:24,2
Even though it's a glass eye
dropper, there's air.


69
0:2:24,2 --> 0:2:26,2
If I hold it up like this--
here, take a look at this--


70
0:2:26,2 --> 0:2:29,4
I can squeeze some of the
bubbles out like this, and


71
0:2:29,4 --> 0:2:30,58
pull some water in.


72
0:2:30,58 --> 0:2:33,66
So in essence, I'm changing
the mass, right?


73
0:2:33,66 --> 0:2:36,38
And now it just barely
bobs there.


74
0:2:36,38 --> 0:2:38,41
See how it bobs up and
down that way?


75
0:2:38,41 --> 0:2:39,69
OK, so that's perfect.


76
0:2:39,69 --> 0:2:41,745
When you make a Cartesian diver,
you've got to have that


77
0:2:41,745 --> 0:2:44,3
kind of set up there, so it just
barely bounces around.


78
0:2:44,3 --> 0:2:46,4
Now we've got a 1
liter bottle.


79
0:2:46,4 --> 0:2:46,99
And I'm using a 1 liter.


80
0:2:46,99 --> 0:2:48,12
You could use a 2 liter.


81
0:2:48,12 --> 0:2:50,31
It's just easier to squeeze
with a 1 liter.


82
0:2:50,31 --> 0:2:51,3
Remove the label.


83
0:2:51,3 --> 0:2:53,7
It's almost full to the top.


84
0:2:53,7 --> 0:2:55,69
And one of the secrets of a
Cartesian diver, to make it


85
0:2:55,69 --> 0:2:58,95
easier to squeeze, anyway, is
to make sure there's just no


86
0:2:58,95 --> 0:2:59,99
air inside the bottle.


87
0:2:59,99 --> 0:3:1,46
The only air that we want--


88
0:3:1,46 --> 0:3:3,43
if you take a look at this right
here-- the only air that


89
0:3:3,43 --> 0:3:6,5
you want is the air that's
in that Cartesian diver.


90
0:3:6,5 --> 0:3:6,43
All right.


91
0:3:6,43 --> 0:3:7,44
So now, here's what happens.


92
0:3:7,44 --> 0:3:11,74
You take a cap and put
the cap on like this.


93
0:3:11,74 --> 0:3:13,65
And now, we're ready to go.


94
0:3:13,65 --> 0:3:17,61
So the way it floats and it
sinks is if I can change the


95
0:3:17,61 --> 0:3:21,29
mass, ultimately changing the
density-- if I can change the


96
0:3:21,29 --> 0:3:24,31
mass, because the volume is
going to stay the same, then


97
0:3:24,31 --> 0:3:26,51
density equals mass
divided by volume.


98
0:3:26,51 --> 0:3:29,71
I know it's nerd fest here, but
I've just got to change


99
0:3:29,71 --> 0:3:32,57
the density so it's greater than
1 and so it will sink.


100
0:3:32,57 --> 0:3:35,74
So watch-- as I squeeze it, you
can actually see the water


101
0:3:35,74 --> 0:3:36,77
level going up.


102
0:3:36,77 --> 0:3:37,6
You see this here?


103
0:3:37,6 --> 0:3:39,25
So I'm just barely
squeezing it.


104
0:3:39,25 --> 0:3:41,5
So water's being pushed
up into here.


105
0:3:41,5 --> 0:3:44,16
The air compresses, because
the water cannot compress.


106
0:3:44,16 --> 0:3:46,535
And when it gets heavy enough,
it finally sinks.


107
0:3:46,535 --> 0:3:47,48
Isn't that nice?


108
0:3:47,48 --> 0:3:50,4
And as you let go,
it will float.


109
0:3:50,4 --> 0:3:53,35
So we've got a perfect way to
be able to make something


110
0:3:53,35 --> 0:3:54,37
float or sink.


111
0:3:54,37 --> 0:3:57,1
And of course, we're just using
our fingers to be able


112
0:3:57,1 --> 0:3:58,6
to squeeze it.


113
0:3:58,6 --> 0:3:59,65
You can do all the magic
that you want to.


114
0:3:59,65 --> 0:4:1,62
You pretend like you have
the magnetic finger.


115
0:4:1,62 --> 0:4:3,9
And when the person comes up,
their finger follows.


116
0:4:3,9 --> 0:4:6,19
And if you just don't want the
person to have the magnetic


117
0:4:6,19 --> 0:4:9,54
finger, then you just don't let
them make it work, right?


118
0:4:9,54 --> 0:4:12,126
But that's the classic
Cartesian diver.


119
0:4:12,126 --> 0:4:15,75
I was introduced to a new style
of Cartesian diver by a


120
0:4:15,75 --> 0:4:17,14
man by the name of Bob Becker.


121
0:4:17,14 --> 0:4:20,73
Bob is a chemistry teacher in
Kirkwood, Missouri, and


122
0:4:20,73 --> 0:4:23,72
actually showed me this version
using plastic eye


123
0:4:23,72 --> 0:4:25,4
droppers called pipettes.


124
0:4:25,4 --> 0:4:26,8
And they're very, very
prevalent in


125
0:4:26,8 --> 0:4:28,2
the chemistry classroom.


126
0:4:28,2 --> 0:4:30,3
A lot of teachers use
these pipettes.


127
0:4:30,3 --> 0:4:32,5
They may be a little bit harder
for just the average


128
0:4:32,5 --> 0:4:34,93
person to get their hands on,
but just befriend a teacher,


129
0:4:34,93 --> 0:4:37,4
and for sure they know
about pipettes.


130
0:4:37,4 --> 0:4:39,35
This one is special, because
it's graduated.


131
0:4:39,35 --> 0:4:40,76
Do you see this one here?


132
0:4:40,76 --> 0:4:42,89
And when you're picking one,
just make sure that you can


133
0:4:42,89 --> 0:4:46,69
find one that the hex nut
will go over the top.


134
0:4:46,69 --> 0:4:50,12
So if I drop this into the water
like this-- so here's


135
0:4:50,12 --> 0:4:50,66
our container.


136
0:4:50,66 --> 0:4:51,84
Let me drop this
into the water.


137
0:4:51,84 --> 0:4:54,8
Of course it floats, right?


138
0:4:54,8 --> 0:4:55,45
I want to weight it down.


139
0:4:55,45 --> 0:4:56,41
So here's what we're
going to do.


140
0:4:56,41 --> 0:4:59,2
We're taking a regular
quarter-inch hex nut.


141
0:4:59,2 --> 0:5:2,43
And I use these brass ones,
because they don't rust.


142
0:5:2,43 --> 0:5:4,56
This goes on the pipette
like that.


143
0:5:4,56 --> 0:5:6,2
So here's what it looks like.


144
0:5:6,2 --> 0:5:8,7
It's just right there
on the pipette.


145
0:5:8,7 --> 0:5:11,13
And then I'm going to twist and
turn it into place like


146
0:5:11,13 --> 0:5:14,43
this, so it kind of holds
it into place.


147
0:5:14,43 --> 0:5:17,4
And that's what it looks like.


148
0:5:17,4 --> 0:5:18,57
It's held into place.


149
0:5:18,57 --> 0:5:21,605
A pair of scissors will help
us cut the end off.


150
0:5:21,605 --> 0:5:25,8
And now we have the makings of
a modern-day Cartesian diver.


151
0:5:25,8 --> 0:5:27,3
So the same thing-- of
course it floats.


152
0:5:27,3 --> 0:5:27,7
So watch.


153
0:5:27,7 --> 0:5:30,3
When we drop it inside,
it floats.


154
0:5:30,3 --> 0:5:33,29
If I squeeze some of the air out
and pull some of the water


155
0:5:33,29 --> 0:5:35,77
in, I can make it so it
just barely floats.


156
0:5:35,77 --> 0:5:38,19
Of course, of we have too much
water in altogether, then the


157
0:5:38,19 --> 0:5:39,62
whole thing will sink.


158
0:5:39,62 --> 0:5:41,49
So I want it so it just
barely floats.


159
0:5:41,49 --> 0:5:44,27
So I'm going to just continue
to play with it.


160
0:5:44,27 --> 0:5:48,17
That seems to be a pretty
good buoyancy there.


161
0:5:48,17 --> 0:5:50,11
Again, that whole idea is so
it just barely floats.


162
0:5:50,11 --> 0:5:52,34
So now that we have it adjusted,
you just have to be


163
0:5:52,34 --> 0:5:54,58
careful that you don't get
any of the water out.


164
0:5:54,58 --> 0:5:55,98
It goes down inside.


165
0:5:55,98 --> 0:5:58,28
Notice how it's full almost
to the very, very top.


166
0:5:58,28 --> 0:5:59,87
That's exactly what we want--


167
0:5:59,87 --> 0:6:1,72
no air inside the bottle.


168
0:6:1,72 --> 0:6:2,77
And now we cap it off.


169
0:6:2,77 --> 0:6:5,47
Again, just as it happened
before, that we saw with the


170
0:6:5,47 --> 0:6:8,48
glass eye dropper, when you
squeeze, notice how the water


171
0:6:8,48 --> 0:6:9,76
goes up inside.


172
0:6:9,76 --> 0:6:11,78
This systems just
works perfectly.


173
0:6:11,78 --> 0:6:12,87
Bob's a genius.


174
0:6:12,87 --> 0:6:18,9
And there is the making of the
modern day Cartesian diver.


175
0:6:18,9 --> 0:6:20,28
We had to find a
way to disguise


176
0:6:20,28 --> 0:6:21,46
this diver right here.


177
0:6:21,46 --> 0:6:24,57
I was working in television in
the early 1990s for a program


178
0:6:24,57 --> 0:6:26,0
called News for Kids.


179
0:6:26,0 --> 0:6:28,49
And so on the set, we had
a whole bunch of kids.


180
0:6:28,49 --> 0:6:29,87
And they were squeezing this.


181
0:6:29,87 --> 0:6:33,1
And the director kept on
commenting that she couldn't


182
0:6:33,1 --> 0:6:35,89
see the diver very
well inside.


183
0:6:35,89 --> 0:6:39,41
So we found other ways to be
able to glue things on, for


184
0:6:39,41 --> 0:6:42,65
example, or use a Sharpie
pen to color on them.


185
0:6:42,65 --> 0:6:45,18
Again, Bob Becker had a
bunch of great ideas.


186
0:6:45,18 --> 0:6:47,16
But I wanted something that
was just a little


187
0:6:47,16 --> 0:6:48,4
bit easier to see.


188
0:6:48,4 --> 0:6:50,485
So I'll show you how we
changed everything.


189
0:6:50,485 --> 0:6:52,36
It looks like a fishing lure.


190
0:6:52,36 --> 0:6:55,7
It's not really a fishing lure
that would catch a fish.


191
0:6:55,7 --> 0:6:57,7
These were specially made,
because the regular fishing


192
0:6:57,7 --> 0:6:59,72
lure just wouldn't go
over the pipette.


193
0:6:59,72 --> 0:7:2,31
Remember coming back and trying
to find a way to be


194
0:7:2,31 --> 0:7:4,11
able to use this and put
it over the pipette.


195
0:7:4,11 --> 0:7:5,18
So here, watch.


196
0:7:5,18 --> 0:7:6,245
This is Squiddy.


197
0:7:6,245 --> 0:7:10,37
So you just open up the little
opening here like this.


198
0:7:10,37 --> 0:7:13,83
And then this slides over
the workings of


199
0:7:13,83 --> 0:7:16,47
the squid like this.


200
0:7:16,47 --> 0:7:19,53
And this is the new squid.


201
0:7:19,53 --> 0:7:21,97
All right, so this
is in place.


202
0:7:21,97 --> 0:7:22,66
Enough history.


203
0:7:22,66 --> 0:7:26,34
As you squeeze, the water goes
inside, the little squid falls


204
0:7:26,34 --> 0:7:29,78
down, and as you let go, the
squid goes up again.


205
0:7:29,78 --> 0:7:31,18
And that was Squiddy.


206
0:7:31,18 --> 0:7:34,11
So let's say you don't have
a squid and you don't have


207
0:7:34,11 --> 0:7:36,54
pipettes and hex nuts and
everything else and you'd like


208
0:7:36,54 --> 0:7:37,74
to do the Cartesian diver.


209
0:7:37,74 --> 0:7:38,96
I'm going to show you
how to do one.


210
0:7:38,96 --> 0:7:39,68
This is ingenious.


211
0:7:39,68 --> 0:7:41,385
It's done out of a condiment.


212
0:7:41,385 --> 0:7:42,32
It's just ketchup.


213
0:7:42,32 --> 0:7:43,68
So you're going to
start collecting


214
0:7:43,68 --> 0:7:45,4
some ketchup packets.


215
0:7:45,4 --> 0:7:48,1
This is an interesting
Cartesian diver.


216
0:7:48,1 --> 0:7:51,43
And it's interesting because,
in this style of Cartesian


217
0:7:51,43 --> 0:7:52,91
diver, there was an open end.


218
0:7:52,91 --> 0:7:55,435
So when you squeeze, water
would go inside.


219
0:7:55,435 --> 0:7:57,96
You would increase the mass,
and it would sink.


220
0:7:57,96 --> 0:7:59,83
But when you use something
like this, these ketchup


221
0:7:59,83 --> 0:8:1,38
packets have never
been opened.


222
0:8:1,38 --> 0:8:4,95
And so this means that the mass
has to stay the same.


223
0:8:4,95 --> 0:8:7,47
We would have to possibly change
the volume if you want


224
0:8:7,47 --> 0:8:8,29
to change the density.


225
0:8:8,29 --> 0:8:9,45
So here's what you need to do.


226
0:8:9,45 --> 0:8:10,97
Not all ketchup packets work.


227
0:8:10,97 --> 0:8:12,895
Collect a whole bunch of
different ketchup packets and


228
0:8:12,895 --> 0:8:15,3
in a container of water,
just drop them inside.


229
0:8:15,3 --> 0:8:16,9
Some will float, and
some will sink.


230
0:8:16,9 --> 0:8:18,48
You're hoping that a
couple will float.


231
0:8:18,48 --> 0:8:20,325
And pick the ones
that will float.


232
0:8:20,325 --> 0:8:22,66
OK, so this is a
good one here.


233
0:8:22,66 --> 0:8:25,29
This one may float just
a little too much.


234
0:8:25,29 --> 0:8:28,69
And this one right over here,
this Carl's Jr. one might do


235
0:8:28,69 --> 0:8:29,44
fairly well.


236
0:8:29,44 --> 0:8:32,62
So you want the two of them
that just barely float.


237
0:8:32,62 --> 0:8:33,49
All right?


238
0:8:33,49 --> 0:8:35,33
The other ones are out
of the question.


239
0:8:35,33 --> 0:8:36,87
So again, here's our bottle.


240
0:8:36,87 --> 0:8:38,84
Let's try that Carl's Jr. one.


241
0:8:38,84 --> 0:8:40,89
Let's see if this one
works fairly well.


242
0:8:40,89 --> 0:8:42,37
So you're going to take
the ketchup packet.


243
0:8:42,37 --> 0:8:43,809
Don't open it up.


244
0:8:43,809 --> 0:8:48,43
Just kind of fold it and push
it down into the bottle.


245
0:8:48,43 --> 0:8:50,15
And you're going to lose some
water, so you're going to have


246
0:8:50,15 --> 0:8:51,41
to fill it back up again.


247
0:8:51,41 --> 0:8:52,6
Ah, so there it is.


248
0:8:52,6 --> 0:8:53,53
Bingo.


249
0:8:53,53 --> 0:8:54,39
Got it.


250
0:8:54,39 --> 0:8:57,69
And now, cap it or top
if off this way.


251
0:8:57,69 --> 0:9:0,9
And we need a cap.


252
0:9:0,9 --> 0:9:2,4
So this will go on the top.


253
0:9:2,4 --> 0:9:3,55
So now, look at what we have.


254
0:9:3,55 --> 0:9:8,485
This is fairly cool, because
this now doesn't get ruined if


255
0:9:8,485 --> 0:9:9,96
you turn it upside down
or anything like that.


256
0:9:9,96 --> 0:9:12,74
It just kind of sits in here.


257
0:9:12,74 --> 0:9:14,906
While you can't see it,
as you squeeze--


258
0:9:14,906 --> 0:9:17,53
and it doesn't take much
of a squeeze at all--


259
0:9:17,53 --> 0:9:20,21
you're now compressing some of
the air that's in that packet


260
0:9:20,21 --> 0:9:22,61
and changing the density
or the buoyancy.


261
0:9:22,61 --> 0:9:27,3
And that's the simplest of
the Cartesian divers.


262
0:9:27,3 --> 0:9:30,18
Now that you know how Squiddy
works-- a simple science toy--


263
0:9:30,18 --> 0:9:32,74
there's a big jump from having
an idea like this to actually


264
0:9:32,74 --> 0:9:33,79
getting it into stores.


265
0:9:33,79 --> 0:9:36,99
And the best way to do that is
a convention called the New


266
0:9:36,99 --> 0:9:37,81
York Toy Fair.


267
0:9:37,81 --> 0:9:40,22
It attracts thousands and
thousands of people.


268
0:9:40,22 --> 0:9:43,75
These are people who own
educational stores, regular


269
0:9:43,75 --> 0:9:45,56
toy stores.


270
0:9:45,56 --> 0:9:47,55
And that's the best way to
be able to show people.


271
0:9:47,55 --> 0:9:49,92
Well, the product line has
grown from just a couple


272
0:9:49,92 --> 0:9:53,27
products that we started with
the 1993 to now over 75


273
0:9:53,27 --> 0:9:55,63
products in a company
called Be Amazing!


274
0:9:55,63 --> 0:9:56,3
Toys.


275
0:9:56,3 --> 0:9:59,1
So I want to give you a behind
the scenes glimpse of what Toy


276
0:9:59,1 --> 0:10:2,5
Fair looks like-- the normal
public isn't allowed in-- and


277
0:10:2,5 --> 0:10:6,1
what happens when you walk the
aisles and ask other people to


278
0:10:6,1 --> 0:10:8,495
show you some of their
best toys, as well.


279
0:10:8,495 --> 0:10:9,32
Take a look.


280
0:10:9,32 --> 0:10:10,79
Well, it's cold for a reason.


281
0:10:10,79 --> 0:10:12,37
It's February in New York.


282
0:10:12,37 --> 0:10:13,4
It can only mean one thing--


283
0:10:13,4 --> 0:10:14,33
Toy Fair.


284
0:10:14,33 --> 0:10:16,7
And we'd like to have you help
us out a little bit.


285
0:10:16,7 --> 0:10:18,55
So we want to comment below and
tell us which toys we're


286
0:10:18,55 --> 0:10:20,84
going to show you are the great
ones and which ones are


287
0:10:20,84 --> 0:10:21,992
kind of-- eh.


288
0:10:21,992 --> 0:10:23,53
Well, you be the judge.


289
0:10:23,53 --> 0:10:29,2
And welcome to Toy Fair 2012.


290
0:10:29,2 --> 0:10:29,49
All right.


291
0:10:29,49 --> 0:10:31,46
This is a sneak peak
of Toy Fair.


292
0:10:31,46 --> 0:10:34,59
We're actually in the exhibit
hall, because we're exhibitors


293
0:10:34,59 --> 0:10:35,79
today with Be Amazing!


294
0:10:35,79 --> 0:10:36,33
Toys.


295
0:10:36,33 --> 0:10:39,2
It's wonderful company they
carries so many of the Steve


296
0:10:39,2 --> 0:10:40,35
Spangler science items.


297
0:10:40,35 --> 0:10:43,65
But they carry it for things
like Target and Walmart and


298
0:10:43,65 --> 0:10:47,55
mass-market stores in addition
to small ma and pa stores.


299
0:10:47,55 --> 0:10:49,51
Those brick and mortar stores
are there as well.


300
0:10:49,51 --> 0:10:51,65
And this is where I get
to hang out for


301
0:10:51,65 --> 0:10:53,85
the next eight hours.


302
0:10:53,85 --> 0:10:55,36
And I have a feeling--
see these hands?


303
0:10:55,36 --> 0:10:58,74
They are going to be
coke-covered here in no time,


304
0:10:58,74 --> 0:11:1,67
because it's my job to launch
as many geysers as I can.


305
0:11:1,67 --> 0:11:3,78
I have 780 bottles
to get through.


306
0:11:3,78 --> 0:11:6,3
And it'll be a successful
day if I get it.


307
0:11:6,3 --> 0:11:7,55
See ya.


308
0:11:7,55 --> 0:11:13,842



309
0:11:13,842 --> 0:11:16,95
Now, when I pull the pin, the
Mentos will fall, just like


310
0:11:16,95 --> 0:11:18,49
the model here, right?


311
0:11:18,49 --> 0:11:21,8
The secret is that those little
pits on the outside of


312
0:11:21,8 --> 0:11:24,29
the Mentos, all the carbon
dioxide rushes to that--


313
0:11:24,29 --> 0:11:26,6
they're called nucleation
points-- and it


314
0:11:26,6 --> 0:11:27,74
shoots the soda out.


315
0:11:27,74 --> 0:11:29,92
We're just going to turn it
sideways, see if Isaac Newton


316
0:11:29,92 --> 0:11:30,75
was correct.


317
0:11:30,75 --> 0:11:32,105
And if he was, we get
a little shot.


318
0:11:32,105 --> 0:11:32,825
All right?


319
0:11:32,825 --> 0:11:35,42
So this goes in here
like this.


320
0:11:35,42 --> 0:11:37,6
All right, normally you're
outside or you're sneaking in


321
0:11:37,6 --> 0:11:40,625
some place that has great
floors like Home Depot.


322
0:11:40,625 --> 0:11:42,97
You'd shoot it all past plumbing
and down the--


323
0:11:42,97 --> 0:11:43,65
don't do that.


324
0:11:43,65 --> 0:11:45,46
This pulls like this
when it falls.


325
0:11:45,46 --> 0:11:46,56
It starts to flow.


326
0:11:46,56 --> 0:11:48,37
And as you let go, bam!


327
0:11:48,37 --> 0:11:49,74
Isn't that a good shot?


328
0:11:49,74 --> 0:11:50,35
That was.


329
0:11:50,35 --> 0:11:54,2
It'll go about 150 feet at about
30 miles an hour with


330
0:11:54,2 --> 0:11:56,2
what you saw there.


331
0:11:56,2 --> 0:11:58,113
Now that we're done at the
booth, let's go check out some


332
0:11:58,113 --> 0:12:1,84
of the cool toys at Toy Fair.


333
0:12:1,84 --> 0:12:4,27
Who doesn't like a severed hand
that runs around on a


334
0:12:4,27 --> 0:12:6,69
wall and scares the
crap out of kids?


335
0:12:6,69 --> 0:12:7,94
That's perfect.


336
0:12:7,94 --> 0:12:13,71



337
0:12:13,71 --> 0:12:16,19
You know, of anybody doing
science kits today, Thames &


338
0:12:16,19 --> 0:12:19,15
Kosmos has got to be one of my
favorites and one of the best.


339
0:12:19,15 --> 0:12:21,33
You look at this-- they're
doing real science.


340
0:12:21,33 --> 0:12:23,96
The materials that you see here
are not watered down.


341
0:12:23,96 --> 0:12:26,2
So if you're looking for
chemistry along the way, this


342
0:12:26,2 --> 0:12:28,15
Thames & Kosmos place
is great.


343
0:12:28,15 --> 0:12:32,19
MALE SPEAKER: Straw with
flavored beads in the middle.


344
0:12:32,19 --> 0:12:33,44
STEVE SPANGLER: Lobster?


345
0:12:33,44 --> 0:12:34,27
Is it lobster?


346
0:12:34,27 --> 0:12:36,9
MALE SPEAKER: That's it.


347
0:12:36,9 --> 0:12:36,24
STEVE SPANGLER: Shrimp?


348
0:12:36,24 --> 0:12:36,78
MALE SPEAKER: Taste it again.


349
0:12:36,78 --> 0:12:38,37
Maybe let the beads dissolve
a little bit more.


350
0:12:38,37 --> 0:12:40,62
You're not quite getting
the flavor.


351
0:12:40,62 --> 0:12:41,18
Now what do you think?


352
0:12:41,18 --> 0:12:41,39
STEVE SPANGLER: Strawberry.


353
0:12:41,39 --> 0:12:42,51
MALE SPEAKER: Strawberry,
you got it.


354
0:12:42,51 --> 0:12:42,9
STEVE SPANGLER: Strawberry
lobster.


355
0:12:42,9 --> 0:12:45,14
It actually tastes like
strawberry lobster and shrimp.


356
0:12:45,14 --> 0:12:46,59
Well, we're at Insect Lore.


357
0:12:46,59 --> 0:12:47,96
These are people that
I've known for years


358
0:12:47,96 --> 0:12:48,54
and years and years.


359
0:12:48,54 --> 0:12:51,3
And there, they manufacture this
wonderful thing called


360
0:12:51,3 --> 0:12:52,48
the butterfly pavilion.


361
0:12:52,48 --> 0:12:55,31
And so I would stand in their
booth years ago and tell


362
0:12:55,31 --> 0:12:57,45
people that the butterflies
were good to eat, and they


363
0:12:57,45 --> 0:12:58,94
were just raising
them for salads.


364
0:12:58,94 --> 0:13:0,56
And a lot of people would
believe that.


365
0:13:0,56 --> 0:13:2,25
And then I got kicked out.


366
0:13:2,25 --> 0:13:3,5
Do not eat the butterflies.


367
0:13:3,5 --> 0:13:6,61



368
0:13:6,61 --> 0:13:8,8
I thought it was just all
about buying bugs.


369
0:13:8,8 --> 0:13:9,88
And now it's a campfire.


370
0:13:9,88 --> 0:13:11,14
MALE SPEAKER: Now it's
all about camping.


371
0:13:11,14 --> 0:13:12,25
STEVE SPANGLER: OK, go away.


372
0:13:12,25 --> 0:13:13,864
I need to get in the camp.


373
0:13:13,864 --> 0:13:14,76
MALE SPEAKER: It's
time for bed.


374
0:13:14,76 --> 0:13:16,34
STEVE SPANGLER: All right, so
here's kind of a you choose it


375
0:13:16,34 --> 0:13:16,95
an adventure.


376
0:13:16,95 --> 0:13:18,43
You can choose what
you want me to do.


377
0:13:18,43 --> 0:13:23,13
I'll either A, go sneak into
the tent at Insect Lore and


378
0:13:23,13 --> 0:13:26,75
sleep there for the night, or
B, I'll pretend like I'm a


379
0:13:26,75 --> 0:13:29,31
sales person, and I'll sell
butterflies, but convince


380
0:13:29,31 --> 0:13:30,94
people that they're not real
and they're animatronics.


381
0:13:30,94 --> 0:13:43,9



382
0:13:43,9 --> 0:13:44,79
All right, well, 3D
is all the rage.


383
0:13:44,79 --> 0:13:48,58
And these are 3D glasses
here from Look3D.


384
0:13:48,58 --> 0:13:51,7
And not only are they 3D
glasses, they make you look


385
0:13:51,7 --> 0:13:52,47
really sexy.


386
0:13:52,47 --> 0:13:53,5
And watch this, I can look--


387
0:13:53,5 --> 0:13:55,14
oh my god.


388
0:13:55,14 --> 0:13:56,24
See that?


389
0:13:56,24 --> 0:13:58,16
All contained in these
classes here.


390
0:13:58,16 --> 0:13:59,23
No batteries at all.


391
0:13:59,23 --> 0:13:59,9
How many pounds?


392
0:13:59,9 --> 0:14:1,7
MALE SPEAKER: This
is 25 pounds.


393
0:14:1,7 --> 0:14:1,3
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


394
0:14:1,3 --> 0:14:3,72
25 pounds of Aaron's
Thinking Putty.


395
0:14:3,72 --> 0:14:5,82
It changes color.


396
0:14:5,82 --> 0:14:7,7
This is a tremendous
amount of fun.


397
0:14:7,7 --> 0:14:10,96
I don't think he was a problem
in school at all.


398
0:14:10,96 --> 0:14:12,51
This is just what he does.


399
0:14:12,51 --> 0:14:13,47
MALE SPEAKER: We're
going to turn that


400
0:14:13,47 --> 0:14:15,77
nice lady into a butterfly.


401
0:14:15,77 --> 0:14:18,7
STEVE SPANGLER: All right, let's
go see the butterfly.


402
0:14:18,7 --> 0:14:19,681
How cool is that?


403
0:14:19,681 --> 0:14:20,931
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].


404
0:14:20,931 --> 0:14:27,39



405
0:14:27,39 --> 0:14:31,34
STEVE SPANGLER: That is
awesome and tasty too.


406
0:14:31,34 --> 0:14:33,43
Tastes like that lobster stuff
that I had at the other booth.


407
0:14:33,43 --> 0:14:35,42
Look at this.


408
0:14:35,42 --> 0:14:36,44
MALE SPEAKER: When you spread
out your fingers, they weave


409
0:14:36,44 --> 0:14:36,97
in and out.


410
0:14:36,97 --> 0:14:38,28
Here, we'll show
them his nose.


411
0:14:38,28 --> 0:14:39,22
Oh, he's scared.


412
0:14:39,22 --> 0:14:41,58
Put it on your shower door,
it turns your whole


413
0:14:41,58 --> 0:14:43,1
shower into a speaker.


414
0:14:43,1 --> 0:14:44,82
STEVE SPANGLER: You're using
the entire box to just


415
0:14:44,82 --> 0:14:46,46
resonate the sound.


416
0:14:46,46 --> 0:14:47,5
Here's a booth--


417
0:14:47,5 --> 0:14:50,275
four million different
kinds of dice.


418
0:14:50,275 --> 0:15:0,68



419
0:15:0,68 --> 0:15:1,74
So here's the deal.


420
0:15:1,74 --> 0:15:5,62
This nice man right here said
that I can go sneak a toy away


421
0:15:5,62 --> 0:15:6,5
during a live shot.


422
0:15:6,5 --> 0:15:9,255
So they wrote something like
"Hello, Denver" or something.


423
0:15:9,255 --> 0:15:11,73
But during the live shot, we'll
go sneak it away and


424
0:15:11,73 --> 0:15:12,57
just see how he reacts.


425
0:15:12,57 --> 0:15:13,4
He's good.


426
0:15:13,4 --> 0:15:14,3
So he'll react well.


427
0:15:14,3 --> 0:15:15,62
CHRIS BYRNE: And you know who's
running around here?


428
0:15:15,62 --> 0:15:17,59
Steve Spangler's running around
Toy Fair creating all


429
0:15:17,59 --> 0:15:18,662
kinds of havoc.


430
0:15:18,662 --> 0:15:20,57
And I-- wait, there he is.


431
0:15:20,57 --> 0:15:21,73
STEVE SPANGLER: I'm taking
this back to the station.


432
0:15:21,73 --> 0:15:23,65
CHRIS BYRNE: He's taking
it back to the station.


433
0:15:23,65 --> 0:15:25,26
So we are having so much fun
here at the American


434
0:15:25,26 --> 0:15:26,29
International Toy Fair.


435
0:15:26,29 --> 0:15:27,33
So great to see you.


436
0:15:27,33 --> 0:15:27,72
STEVE SPANGLER: You too.


437
0:15:27,72 --> 0:15:28,85
There's the regular--


438
0:15:28,85 --> 0:15:31,24
there's six things on a die.


439
0:15:31,24 --> 0:15:32,72
And then there's this
one that's red.


440
0:15:32,72 --> 0:15:35,85
And this one, it's another die,
which looks a lot like


441
0:15:35,85 --> 0:15:37,79
this one, but it's completely
called the swirl die.


442
0:15:37,79 --> 0:15:40,87
And this is the gator die
and the pearl die.


443
0:15:40,87 --> 0:15:43,21
This would be the cow die, the
dog die, and the woodland


444
0:15:43,21 --> 0:15:44,29
animal die--


445
0:15:44,29 --> 0:15:46,8
not to be confused with the
bison die, the beetle die, the


446
0:15:46,8 --> 0:15:48,14
scorpion die, and
the ladybug die.


447
0:15:48,14 --> 0:15:49,55
One of my favorites--


448
0:15:49,55 --> 0:15:50,47
the bat die.


449
0:15:50,47 --> 0:15:53,18
There's the sided die--
the 16-sided die.


450
0:15:53,18 --> 0:15:57,165
There's the hip dice, Chinese
dice, Amish dice, regular


451
0:15:57,165 --> 0:15:59,56
dice, Japanese dice, and another
alien dice which is


452
0:15:59,56 --> 0:16:2,29
probably a knock-off of that
alien dice over there.


453
0:16:2,29 --> 0:16:4,52
There's spotted, spotted,
spotted, counting.


454
0:16:4,52 --> 0:16:7,95
There's loaded dice, just in
case you have a craps game and


455
0:16:7,95 --> 0:16:8,73
you want to win--


456
0:16:8,73 --> 0:16:9,68
loaded dice.


457
0:16:9,68 --> 0:16:12,21
Nothing says I love you more,
kids, than to give you a bowl


458
0:16:12,21 --> 0:16:14,1
of dice for your birthday.


459
0:16:14,1 --> 0:16:14,65
Happy birthday.


460
0:16:14,65 --> 0:16:16,37
Here's a bowl of dice.


461
0:16:16,37 --> 0:16:19,5
My all time favorite-- you can
vote on it down below--


462
0:16:19,5 --> 0:16:20,75
opaque die.


463
0:16:20,75 --> 0:16:23,6



464
0:16:23,6 --> 0:16:25,86
One question we never get to
ask-- what do you think about


465
0:16:25,86 --> 0:16:27,11
alligators?


466
0:16:27,11 --> 0:16:29,38



467
0:16:29,38 --> 0:16:32,1
And do you have any thoughts
on the current debate over


468
0:16:32,1 --> 0:16:35,15
endoplasmic reticulum?


469
0:16:35,15 --> 0:16:36,38
MALE SPEAKER: I'll show you
just a quick trick here.


470
0:16:36,38 --> 0:16:37,64
You've got a ring now, right?


471
0:16:37,64 --> 0:16:37,96
STEVE SPANGLER: Right.


472
0:16:37,96 --> 0:16:38,8
MALE SPEAKER: If I squeeze
them together,


473
0:16:38,8 --> 0:16:40,8
now I've got a triangle.


474
0:16:40,8 --> 0:16:43,195
If I fold up the tips, I've
got an octahedron.


475
0:16:43,195 --> 0:16:45,3
I can put it back down and smash
it and it goes right


476
0:16:45,3 --> 0:16:45,795
back into a ring.


477
0:16:45,795 --> 0:16:46,6
STEVE SPANGLER: Nice.


478
0:16:46,6 --> 0:16:48,24
MALE SPEAKER: Now, pinch here,
fold it over, and I've got


479
0:16:48,24 --> 0:16:50,43
myself a spinning top.


480
0:16:50,43 --> 0:16:51,985
And if I add two, I get eight.


481
0:16:51,985 --> 0:16:53,26
Eight's a cool number.


482
0:16:53,26 --> 0:16:57,682
I known to be two times two
times two, or two cubed.


483
0:16:57,682 --> 0:16:58,49
Just like that.


484
0:16:58,49 --> 0:17:1,71
Now, I'll show you a
really cool trick.


485
0:17:1,71 --> 0:17:2,89
It requires 12.


486
0:17:2,89 --> 0:17:4,329
So I'm going to add
four more here.


487
0:17:4,329 --> 0:17:6,335
And 12's a really interesting
number, because it allows me


488
0:17:6,335 --> 0:17:8,63
to just wrap them around
my fingers twice.


489
0:17:8,63 --> 0:17:8,915
STEVE SPANGLER: Right.


490
0:17:8,915 --> 0:17:11,56
MALE SPEAKER: Pinch here, and I
pull these two to the side.


491
0:17:11,56 --> 0:17:13,619
Now I've got myself a ball.


492
0:17:13,619 --> 0:17:16,93
STEVE SPANGLER: God,
that's amazing.


493
0:17:16,93 --> 0:17:18,18
[STEVE, POORLY, PLAYING "CLOSE
TO YOU" ON UKELELE]


494
0:17:18,18 --> 0:17:27,4



495
0:17:27,4 --> 0:17:28,65
STEVE SPANGLER: It's
out of tune.


496
0:17:28,65 --> 0:17:35,58
