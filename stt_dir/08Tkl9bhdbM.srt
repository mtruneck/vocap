Greetings, I am Michael Jivets, Producer on World of Tanks


2
0:0:24,0 --> 0:0:33,0
What’s the reason for implementing 3 player platoons in tank companies for non-premium accounts in the 8.5 update?


3
0:0:33,0 --> 0:0:42,0
We’re continuing to reduce the impact of gold and how it influences the game experience, and that’s why we’ve decided to introduce these new features.


4
0:0:42,0 --> 0:0:47,0
Forum users have actively discussed a new plan of being able to buy premium equipment for credits.


5
0:0:47,0 --> 0:0:49,0
Is this currently an experiment?


6
0:0:49,0 --> 0:0:54,0
Yes, it is, just like buying premium shells for credits was an experiment.


7
0:0:54,0 --> 0:0:56,0
What about buying experience with credits? 


8
0:0:56,0 --> 0:0:57,0
Will this ever happen? 


9
0:0:57,0 --> 0:1:0,0
No, this will never happen. That’s for certain.


10
0:1:0,0 --> 0:1:6,0
How will the light Soviet tanks introduced in the 8.5 update influence the Т-50 and Т-50-2?


11
0:1:6,0 --> 0:1:10,0
Perhaps these vehicles will become slightly less popular.


12
0:1:10,0 --> 0:1:18,0
But their gameplay will not be influenced at all. Simply because this line will not compete with the Т-50 and Т50-2.


13
0:1:18,0 --> 0:1:23,0
The Т-50-2 is still going to be a top tier light Soviet tank.


14
0:1:23,0 --> 0:1:28,0
Can players expect to see new premium vehicles in the 8.5 update?


15
0:1:28,0 --> 0:1:34,0
Yes. This update we will add a new premium British SPG, the Sexton 1.


16
0:1:34,0 --> 0:1:40,0
Do you plan to make any changes or corrections to the game mechanics in the 8.5 update?


17
0:1:40,0 --> 0:1:46,0
Yes, we’re going to correct some old and recently arisen errors that may have be obvious to some of our players.


18
0:1:46,0 --> 0:1:54,0
For example, having artillery’s high-explosive shells detonate in the air. This bug was detected in the 8.4 update. As it is right 


19
0:1:54,0 --> 0:1:58,0
now, the explosion is not shown in the area where it actually happens.


20
0:1:58,0 --> 0:2:6,0
The shell can still hit a tank and explode, but a player will see it happen 10 to 15 meters above the tank.


21
0:2:6,0 --> 0:2:14,0
We’ll also correct another feature regarding HE shells. Right now, when a high-explosive shell hits a destroyed tank, it causes no 


22
0:2:14,0 --> 0:2:17,0
splash damage to the nearby tanks.


23
0:2:17,0 --> 0:2:26,0
Now, with the 8.5 update, after hitting a destroyed tank with a high-explosive shell, it will cause splash damage as if it hit the ground near the tank.


24
0:2:26,0 --> 0:2:31,0
They say the speed of IS-7 will be increased from 50 to 60 km per hour.


25
0:2:31,0 --> 0:2:33,0
Is that true?


26
0:2:33,0 --> 0:2:35,0
Yes, it will happen. It’s not a rumor.


27
0:2:35,0 --> 0:2:39,0
We’ll be increasing the maximum speed of the IS-7 to 60 km per hour.


28
0:2:39,0 --> 0:2:43,0
Can we expect any new premium Chinese tanks?


29
0:2:43,0 --> 0:2:49,0
We’ll be adding new premium tanks, including high-tier Chinese vehicles around tier eight.


30
0:2:49,0 --> 0:2:55,0
What about tier eight heavy Chinese tank, like the WZ-111? Will that make an appearance?


31
0:2:55,0 --> 0:2:58,0
There are no plans to put that tank in the store.


32
0:2:58,0 --> 0:3:2,0
It’s possible our players may see it appear during special events.


33
0:3:2,0 --> 0:3:5,0
Are there any details you can share about the 8.6 update?


34
0:3:5,0 --> 0:3:10,0
The 8.6 update will feature many changes. 


35
0:3:10,0 --> 0:3:16,0
The most important of which will be the expansion of the SPG line, up to tier 10.


36
0:3:16,0 --> 0:3:21,0
When testing the 8.5 update, many players noticed the new tier 10 heavy tanks.


37
0:3:21,0 --> 0:3:24,0
What’s the status of these particular vehicles?


38
0:3:24,0 --> 0:3:29,0
These are not premium vehicles and they can’t be bought in the store. 


39
0:3:29,0 --> 0:3:33,0
Also, these tanks can’t be researched; they are not included in tech trees.


40
0:3:33,0 --> 0:5:33,0
These vehicles will be special high-tier content for players�
