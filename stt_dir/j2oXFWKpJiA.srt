1
0:0:12,218 --> 0:0:20,5
As children we fear the dark.


2
0:0:20,5 --> 0:0:30,689
The unknown troubles us.


3
0:0:30,689 --> 0:0:35,0
Anything might be out there.


4
0:0:35,0 --> 0:0:39,719
Ironically, it's our fate to live in the dark.


5
0:0:39,719 --> 0:0:43,869
Head out from the Earth in any direction you choose


6
0:0:43,869 --> 0:0:49,5
and, after an initial flash of blue,


7
0:0:49,5 --> 0:0:54,408
you're surrounded by blackness,


8
0:0:54,408 --> 0:1:5,368
punctuated only here and there by the faint and distant stars.


9
0:1:5,368 --> 0:1:11,67
Even after we're grown, the darkness retains its power to frighten us.


10
0:1:11,67 --> 0:1:15,57
And so there are those who say we should not inquire too closely


11
0:1:15,57 --> 0:1:20,0
into who else might be living in that darkness.


12
0:1:20,0 --> 0:1:26,739
Better not to know, they say.  


13
0:1:26,739 --> 0:1:32,69
There are 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy,


14
0:1:32,69 --> 0:1:34,0
of this immnse multitude,


15
0:1:34,0 --> 0:1:36,5
could it be that our hum drum sun 


16
0:1:36,5 --> 0:1:44,0
is the only one with an inhabited planet?


17
0:1:44,0 --> 0:1:47,0
Maybe.


18
0:1:47,0 --> 0:1:54,769
Maybe the origin of life or intelligence is exceedingly improbable.


19
0:1:54,769 --> 0:2:1,129
Or, maybe civilizations arise all the time,


20
0:2:1,129 --> 0:2:9,438
but wipe themselves out as soon as they are able.


21
0:2:9,438 --> 0:2:18,68
Or, here and there, peppered across space,


22
0:2:18,68 --> 0:2:26,27
maybe there are worlds, something like our own,


23
0:2:26,27 --> 0:2:32,85
on which other beings gaze up and wonder, as we do,


24
0:2:32,85 --> 0:2:43,0
about who else lives in the dark.


25
0:2:43,0 --> 0:2:46,56
Life is a comparative rarity,


26
0:2:46,56 --> 0:2:52,68
you can survey dozens of worlds and find that on only one of them


27
0:2:52,68 --> 0:3:0,0
does life arise and evolve and persist.


28
0:3:0,0 --> 0:3:3,598
If we humans ever go to those worlds


29
0:3:3,598 --> 0:3:8,98
then it will be because a nation, or a consortium of them


30
0:3:8,98 --> 0:3:16,128
believes it to be to its advantage, or to the advantage of the human species.


31
0:3:16,128 --> 0:3:25,0
In our time, we've crossed the solar system and sent four ships to the stars.


32
0:3:25,0 --> 0:3:30,0
But we continue to search for inhabitants.


33
0:3:30,0 --> 0:5:30,0
Life looks for life.
