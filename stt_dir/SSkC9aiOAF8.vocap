###36 HANNAH BROOKS: Hello, I'm Hannah, I'm an addict.
###39 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###41 HANNAH BROOKS: I went to a rehab like this about a year
###44 and a half ago.
###46 I know how hard it is.
###49 It's a really, really hard thing to do.
###50 And I think you're all very, very brave.
###52 To be here.
###53 [CLAPPING]
###53 [CHANTING]
###55 HANNAH BROOKS: Thankfully I didn't come to
###56 Indonesia for treatment.
###58 And I'm not here to interview this group
###59 of recovering addicts.
###62 I'm here to buy a pair of shoes.
###64 [CLAPPING]
###65 [CHANTING]
###66 
###78 HANNAH BROOKS: I'm at a drug treatment center called YAKITA
###79 in Bogor, an area about 60 kilometers outside Jakarta.
###85 Indonesia experienced the beginnings of an unprecedented
###88 drug epidemic in the 1980s.
###90 Sparked in part by rapid economic growth and the
###93 increasing availability of new drugs, Indonesia found itself
###97 facing a crisis it had no idea how to handle.
###101 A couple, David and Joyce, founded the center in 1999 in
###105 response to the growing problem.
###108 DAVID GORDON: The drug of choice that really kicked it
###110 off was ecstasy in the '80s, in the early '80s, because it
###115 became the love drug.
###117 And it was in the discotheques.
###119 It was in the night life.
###120 And from there it immediately dropped to heroin.
###125 And then in the late '90s is when shabu shabu
###130 methamphetamine began to surface.
###134 HANNAH BROOKS: In the past decade, shabu shabu has
###136 overtaken heroin as Indonesia's drug of choice,
###139 with meth labs popping up all over the country, making it
###142 cheap and easy to access.
###144 DAVID GORDON: There was no recovery in the country.
###146 Hospitalization was unheard of.
###149 Rehabilitation was unheard of.
###151 It was too big.
###152 Where do you start when nothing's been started?
###157 HANNAH BROOKS: While YAKITA is a center for men, they also
###159 run a program for female addicts and partners of
###162 addicts, focused on providing support, skills, and income.
###166 These women design and produce sandals called junkies.
###170 I love the name.
###171 And I really want a pair.
###172 So we go to the workshop where the junkies are produced.
###175 
###181 DAVID GORDON: We were just thinking about what we could
###183 do, in a sense of what they call vocational training.
###188 What we call just trying to get some
###190 jobs for young people.
###193 HANNAH BROOKS: Dian showed me around the workshop.
###196 DIAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###197 
###216 HANNAH BROOKS: As none of the women had made shoes before,
###218 their initial designs were simple slip on sandals,
###221 thongs, ballet flats, and some bracelets.
###225 While Joyce oversees the project, the women design and
###227 assemble the shoes themselves, and have the final say about
###231 what becomes a junkie shoe and what doesn't.
###235 So how do you guys know each other?
###237 Is it through meetings, or the center, or just through here?
###241 OK, are you guys friends?
###243 
###247 Best friends?
###249 BFF?
###250 You too?
###251 
###255 Do you do lots of shopping?
###257 
###263 That's your new addiction, is it?
###267 I find it really, really funny that they're called junkies.
###271 What do you guys think about that?
###273 
###279 So you can kind of see the humor in it now?
###282 
###292 JOYCE DJAELANI: We chose that name together because we felt
###296 in the past addiction, junkies, is a
###299 negative part of you.
###300 But how do you change that into something that's
###302 empowering?
###303 So changing the connotation of the word junkies into
###307 something that's positive.
###309 [SPEAK FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###310 
###313 HANNAH BROOKS: So you're an addict?
###316 Can I ask what your drug of choice was?
###319 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###320 
###323 HANNAH BROOKS: Dian explains that she grew
###324 up in a broken home.
###326 She left when she was 14 and began selling heroin for her
###329 brother, becoming addicted in the process.
###332 Did you ever get busted when you were
###334 helping them deal drugs?
###337 DIAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###338 
###352 HANNAH BROOKS: That's pretty ballsy.
###354 [LAUGHTER]
###355 HANNAH BROOKS: Wow.
###356 In Indonesia, shabu is kind of taking over as the big drug.
###361 ANITA: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE].
###363 
###370 HANNAH BROOKS: Home delivery.
###372 That's convenient.
###373 ANITA: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###374 
###394 HANNAH BROOKS: A lot of women at the center have lost their
###396 spouses to drugs, including Novi, who was addicted to
###400 heroin for the past 16 years.
###402 And do you just buy it up the street?
###404 
###408 From your husband.
###409 
###413 Your husband was a heroin addict too?
###414 
###422 Sorry to hear that.
###424 JOYCE DJAELANI: We began to think also in terms of how to
###427 keep the women coming and not to be dependent on their
###432 spouses, who were still addicts.
###435 How can they generate a little income?
###437 A sort of type of livelihood for them to continue coming to
###441 the center.
###442 So they are able to have some money to actually pay for the
###445 bus to come over, have some money for their daughters to
###449 go to school, so that was how it started.
###453 HANNAH BROOKS: So did you struggle
###454 with relapsing initially?
###455 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###457 
###477 HANNAH BROOKS: Yeah.
###478 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###479 
###486 JOYCE DJAELANI: It's not like being in a factory, where
###488 you're timed by whatever it is you create.
###493 But actually just by making the sandals together and
###496 sharing your life stories, it becomes so fluid.
###500 And everybody gets to know one another.
###502 It's empowering for everyone.
###505 HANNAH BROOKS: And so are you practicing Muslims?
###509 And with your drug use in the past, how have the two things
###512 kind of sat together?
###513 Has that been really difficult?
###515 ANITA: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###516 
###523 DIAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###525 
###531 HANNAH BROOKS: Oh, wow.
###533 Did you have a hard time finding veins?
###535 DIAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###537 
###545 HANNAH BROOKS: So you were injecting in your feet.
###547 DIAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###548 
###552 HANNAH BROOKS: And, I mean did you overdose?
###555 DIAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###556 
###566 HANNAH BROOKS: Have a lot of people in your life died?
###568 DIAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###570 
###574 HANNAH BROOKS: A hundred.
###575 DIAN: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###576 
###585 DAVID GORDON: A lot of the young people that are with us,
###587 that have HIV, and they have AIDS, and they have
###592 tuberculosis, they don't have any way to pay for medicine.
###597 And we thought this would be a really good way to generate
###603 jobs where a bunch of the young people could actually be
###606 there and make these sandals, and then we would be
###610 able to sell them.
###612 HANNAH BROOKS: Would you guys like to
###612 model some of the shoes?
###613 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###615 
###626 HANNAH BROOKS: What about the black ones?
###628 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###629 
###643 HANNAH BROOKS: I have big feet.
###646 Shoe sizes run small in Indonesia.
###647 But the women eventually found a pair that fit me, made from
###650 a local batik.
###653 Yeah, they're nice.
###654 
###656 Dian glued the label onto my very own pair of junkies.
###660 JOYCE DJAELANI: If they were not addicts, they would not
###662 end up in these programs, and learn so much about life and
###665 living and getting a family that really cares about them.
###669 And that's what's important for them.
