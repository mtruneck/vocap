###0 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###2 THOMAS MORTON: Hey, it's Thomas.
###4 We are in an old shipping yard--
###6 the tail end of Brooklyn.
###8 It sort of looks like a set from Season 2 of The Wire, but
###11 is actually the set for seasons "all"
###13 of Boardwalk Empire.
###14 
###18 We're going to meet the show's creator, and a main director,
###21 main writer--
###21 Terence Winter.
###23 He came up writing spec scripts in early '90s
###26 Hollywood for such classy fare as Sister, Sister and Xena:
###30 Warrior Princess.
###32 Then he became one of the main staff writers on The Sopranos
###36 and created this thing with Martin Scorsese.
###41 
###48 THOMAS MORTON: Hi.
###49 TERENCE WINTER: Hi.
###50 THOMAS MORTON: Thank you for taking us out here.
###53 What's going on today?-- some sort of glue?
###55 TERENCE WINTER: This is, I guess, just
###57 touch up on the boardwalk.
###60 These boards are actually weathered.
###63 I mean, Atlantic City is actually right on the ocean,
###65 so the whole place is weathered.
###66 Actually, when we built this, even when it was brand-new, we
###68 had to weather down the boardwalk to make it look like
###70 it wasn't new, because it's supposed to be the real thing.
###73 
###76 THOMAS MORTON: I wanted to ask you because it's something
###78 that's always kind of both inspired and terrified me
###82 about your history, is the switching to screenwriting
###85 when you were almost 30, which is where I'm almost at.
###89 Because you were in law, and you did a bunch of other stuff
###91 before that.
###91 And you're from Brooklyn.
###93 Was the writing thing something you did on the side
###96 and slowly simmered until you couldn't take it, or was there
###100 some sort of snap moment where you kind of realized your--
###103 TERENCE WINTER: It simmered.
###104 I didn't do it on the side.
###105 I hadn't written a script until I already decided to
###108 quit everything and just go and fully commit to that.
###112 My ambition as a kid was really relegated to, I wanted
###114 to make money, and by the time I grew up a little bit, the
###118 only two jobs that I was really focused on that I knew
###121 made a lot of money, or at least I thought, were doctor
###123 and lawyer.
###124 So lawyer seemed feasible because I was a pretty good
###126 bullshit artist.
###127 And I thought, all right, well let me do that.
###130 I didn't even consider whether or not I would like it.
###132 It just seemed like an important job, and I wanted to
###135 be important.
###136 And have a diploma written in Latin.
###139 So I did that, and I was really miserable.
###140 But all the while, I was still a big fan of movies and TV.
###144 And that ambition was sort of growing.
###148 THOMAS MORTON: Now, did you ever actually learn
###150 screenwriting, or was it in-built from years of
###153 watching television and kind of picking up the rhythms?
###155 TERENCE WINTER: Yeah.
###156 It was mostly that-- mostly osmosis.
###159 And I started out writing sitcoms.
###161 I watched a gazillion hours of TV sitcoms as a kid.
###164 There's a station--
###165 WPIX--
###166 in New York-- channel 11 that in the '60s and '70s just ran
###170 Gilligan's Island, The Munsters, The Abbott and
###172 Costello Show--
###173 just over and over again.
###175 So I just soaked all that in.
###180 And I felt like I understood the rhythms of a sitcom, and
###184 also the idea that a sitcom sitcom script is 30 minutes
###187 long, 22 minutes long.
###188 And I thought, OK, I can do this.
###191 I got to L.A. I went to the Writers' Guild.
###194 I got actual physical scripts.
###196 I looked at how they were formatted--
###198 I think, maybe read Syd Field's screenplay book and
###201 just got the basics, and then I just plunged in.
###203 I wrote a Doogie Howser spec script.
###205 That was the first thing I ever wrote, because I had
###207 heard about a guy back in Brooklyn.
###209 His uncle knew a guy who was an
###211 electrician on Doogie Howser.
###213 I thought, oh, this is great.
###214 I'll just write a Doogie Howser.
###214 I'll get it to him, and I'll get a job on the show.
###217 THOMAS MORTON: Slide it under the bathroom stall.
###218 TERENCE WINTER: Yeah.
###218 That, unfortunately, did not happen, but that was it.
###222 And then I just kept doing it from there.
###224 And I used to actually tape sitcoms and dissect them.
###229 I'd stop and watch a scene.
###231 I'd write down what happened in a scene.
###232 I'd watch the next scene, and write down
###233 what happened in it.
###233 It's almost like when people say they want to grow up to be
###236 an engineer, and they used to take a radio apart and put it
###239 back together.
###239 I used to do that with stories.
###240 THOMAS MORTON: When you were writing for sitcoms, like
###243 Sister, Sister, and Xena, and stuff, what were the other
###246 writers like there?
###247 I think a lot of people tend to kind of look down on that
###250 stuff as pretty lowbrow, but it takes a level of
###254 workmanship just to make things that good.
###257 TERENCE WINTER: Early on in my career, I wasn't planning out
###260 a career path.
###261 If you offered me a job writing, I would say yes.
###263 I mean, that was my standard.
###265 I just was thrilled to be making a living at this, so I
###268 was proud to have those jobs.
###269 And, look, I mean, you take a show like Sister, Sister.
###272 It's a show generally written for kids between the
###276 ages of 9 and 13.
###277 So, yeah, it's not going to be Seinfeld.
###280 It's a different animal.
###281 And there are a lot of people who worked on those types of
###284 shows for a long time--
###285 Full House, Family Matters.
###288 That's a skill set.
###289 And there's an audience for that, and there's a generation
###292 of kids who will look back at that and go, ah, that was my
###294 favorite show growing up.
###295 I've actually gotten more attention from friends' kids
###300 for that than I have for The Sopranos.
###302 They go, oh, I used to love that show.
###304 
###308 THOMAS MORTON: How did you catch David Chase's attention?
###310 How did you start working on The Sopranos?
###313 TERENCE WINTER: I got pilot the episode--
###315 actually, the videotape.
###316 I'm dating myself.
###317 My agent sent me the tape of the pilot of The Sopranos.
###319 And he said, I want you to watch this thing.
###321 And I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever seen.
###323 And I'd grown up in Brooklyn--
###326 sort of knew people like that in that world.
###328 I actually worked in a butcher's shop that was owned,
###331 basically, by Paul Castellano, who was the head of the
###333 Gambino family at one point.
###335 And I just sort of was familiar with that terrain.
###338 So I called my agent and said, you've got to
###340 get me on this show.
###341 The second call was to a guy named Frank Renzulli, who
###343 co-created the first show I ever worked on, called The
###345 Great Defender.
###346 Frank grew up in Boston in a similar environment.
###349 I said, have you seen this thing?
###350 He said, yeah, I'm actually meeting with this guy David
###351 Chase on Friday.
###352 I said, you've got to get me in there with you.
###354 He said, I'll do my best.
###355 As it turned out, Frank was the last guy David hired for
###357 his season one staff, so the door got shut down.
###361 So, basically, what happened is most of the first year
###363 staff didn't survive.
###365 Frank was one of the few people who did.
###367 And when it came time for Season 2, finally, David said,
###369 all right, who's this guy you've been telling me about?
###370 And he says, it's my friend, Terry Winter.
###372 I'm telling you, he can write the show.
###373 Just give him a shot.
###374 And David did, and he gave me an episode to write, and it
###378 was basically an audition.
###380 And the idea is if I did good, I would get hired,
###382 and I guess I did.
###383 THOMAS MORTON: So it was yet another spec script?
###385 TERENCE WINTER: Yeah, basically.
###386 THOMAS MORTON: So you've got a show you're making with Martin
###388 Scorsese and Mick Jagger.
###389 Can you tell us about that or is it hush-hush?
###392 TERENCE WINTER: Yeah.
###393 We're developing a show that we set in New York City in
###396 1973, which was the year that disco, hip-hop, and punk rock
###402 sort of all were born--
###405 centers around the music business, if you haven't
###406 guessed already.
###407 Basically, an A and R guy sort of the middle of his career.
###411 And it was a really interesting period, musically.
###414 The city was at a low point, in terms of
###417 economics and crime.
###418 And, as is often the case, great art is born
###422 of times like that.
###424 And it was just an amazingly fertile time for music.
###427 And I'm lucky enough to be working with Martin Scorsese
###431 and Mick Jagger on this, which is just--
###433 these are the days when I wake up and go, OK, I'm dreaming--
###437 the first time you find yourself in a room with those
###438 two guys, and think, how did I get here?
###441 THOMAS MORTON: How was it going from being a writer for
###446 like 20 years into making your own writing room.
###450 And the whole show--
###452 I'm sorry.
###452 There's a lot more to it that that.
###454 But how hard of a transition was that?
###457 TERENCE WINTER: It wasn't really hard.
###460 I had the great good fortune to learn at
###462 the feet of the master.
###463 David was just an incredible manager of the entire show,
###469 not just the writers' room, but the whole thing--
###471 and really great at putting a crew together, and really
###474 mixing and matching people who really wanted to work together
###476 and hang together, and we had a really fun, happy set.
###480 THOMAS MORTON: Well, could we take a look around this set?
###483 TERENCE WINTER: Yeah, sure.
###483 Absolutely.
###485 
###487 This is our Boardwalk set.
###491 This is, I think, the size of a football field.
###494 It took months and months to build.
###496 It was designed by our original production
###497 designer, Bob Shaw.
###499 It's essentially a replica of the Atlantic City boardwalk,
###501 circa 1920.
###504 Most of the stories you see are based on the research of
###507 stores that were very similar or actually existed in
###510 Atlantic City.
###511 The Fralinger's taffy store is actually still there.
###515 And the incubator baby exhibit was actually something that
###519 was in Atlantic City and Coney Island.
###522 THOMAS MORTON: Worth paying $0.25 to see,
###523 some underweight babies.
###524 TERENCE WINTER: Yeah.
###526 Really, Atlantic City was so cool because it means
###528 everything from highbrow entertainment, like the best
###532 of Broadway, to lowbrow stuff, like carnival stuff.
###535 
###539 THOMAS MORTON: How much research did--
###540 I know you're fastidious about it for the creation of the
###544 show, but in its initial inception, how much background
###547 had you done when you were bringing it to the table?
###550 TERENCE WINTER: Oh, months and months of research.
###552 There are so many different components to the show.
###555 There's the World War I component with Jimmy Darmody.
###558 -I've been kissing your ass since I was 12.
###559 -And what about the last three years?
###564 -I wanted to serve my country.
###565 -And nearly get yourself killed.
###566 TERENCE WINTER: There was the prohibition component, the
###568 political component.
###569 -This establishment is being shuttered for violation of the
###573 Volstead Act.
###574 -It's loaded, sir.
###575 There is over 200 cases of brandy wine and champagne.
###579 TERENCE WINTER: Pop culture--
###580 there were so many different aspects of the show--
###583 what was going on in the gangster world, what was going
###585 on in Chicago.
###587 -You guys gonna get into the liquor business, too?
###589 THOMAS MORTON: Now, was there something before the book that
###591 led you into it, or was that the primary source?
###594 TERENCE WINTER: No.
###595 The book--
###596 I started there, and the book was given to me by HBO.
###599 This wasn't something that was necessarily on my radar.
###601 I didn't know what I was going to do next after The Sopranos.
###603 HBO called me up in 2007 during the last season, and
###606 they said we have a book called Boardwalk Empire.
###608 It's basically the history of Atlantic City.
###610 Why don't you read it and see if you think there's a TV
###612 series in there.
###613 And oh, by the way, Martin Scorcese's attached to this.
###615 
###619 The signage has changed from season to season, too, because
###622 they advertise different things on the boardwalk.
###624 
###628 This set over here we're coming to is called the
###631 Swiss-Knit Shop.
###633 And we couldn't figure out what that was.
###636 And what it is is that people would rent bathing suits, and
###639 they were knit wool bathing suits.
###641 So you wear a wool bathing suit, and then give it back,
###644 and it was actually rented to somebody else.
###647 THOMAS MORTON: I think I'd rather spend my
###648 quarter on the preemies.
###650 TERENCE WINTER: Actually, the boards on this are actually--
###653 this is the level of detail--
###654 I don't know if you noticed, like, some of them, like, form
###656 an arrow facing that way, and some form an
###658 arrow facing that way.
###660 If you're moving either north or south on the boardwalk,
###664 they basically tell you which way to walk.
###666 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, so they're kind of like lanes.
###667 TERENCE WINTER: Yeah, sort of.
###667 If you're heading this way, stay this side.
###670 And that way, the other side.
###671 THOMAS MORTON: You mean that's how it is on the
###672 Atlantic City boardwalk?
###673 I've never heard of that.
###673 TERENCE WINTER: Yeah, these are
###674 absolutely the same pattern.
###677 THOMAS MORTON: Psychological pressure to keep moving.
###679 TERENCE WINTER: Yeah, exactly, and head
###680 in the right direction.
###680 One of the few things that we purposely changed was the fact
###684 that our benches face toward the ocean.
###686 In Atlantic City, they actually face toward the
###688 boardwalk, so people would actually watch each other
###690 promenade in their Easter bonnets and stuff.
###694 But we figured, in modern day you'd want to look at the
###697 ocean, even though we don't have an actual ocean.
###699 We put it in later digitally.
###703 This is the Ritz Carlton set where Nucky
###705 lives and has his offices.
###709 He actually lived in the real Ritz Carlton in Atlantic City,
###711 but the real Ritz Carlton was one of the few really kind of
###715 boring looking structures.
###716 It didn't really have anything special about it, so we
###721 cheated a little.
###722 We took another hotel whose name I can't remember, and
###725 said, well, we'll call that the Ritz Carlton because
###726 nobody really knows, because it just looked more fancy--
###730 so built it out, and, yeah, a little more, like, befitting a
###734 guy like Nucky.
###736 And the great thing about this set is you can come right in
###740 and go all the way to the elevators.
###742 And the elevators don't go up, but the doors open and close.
###745 So you can take him right off the elevator, open it up, and
###747 have people in here talking, drinking tea, playing the
###752 piano, and right all the way straight out into the
###754 boardwalk in one shot, and it just really
###756 makes it come alive.
###758 It's also, you remember this factored in pretty
###760 heavily in Season 1--
###762 the Belle Femme dress shop-- and this-- same thing--
###765 you can walk right in there, and have people interacting,
###768 and looking through the window.
###769 And it just gives life that goes far
###772 beyond your normal set.
###773 And, just again, the level of detail from our production
###777 design, it's just--
###779 everything just looks so--
###780 see, this chandelier is like--
###782 yeah, it's amazing.
###783 THOMAS MORTON: It's incredible.
###784 Well, thank you, man.
###785 This has been a real good time.
###786 TERENCE WINTER: My pleasure, man.
###787 Really nice meeting you and talking to you.
###788
