###10 -Every year at this time, everyone on the eastern
###12 seaboard who knows anything about snowboarding shows up
###14 for the US Open halfpipe.
###16 We're expecting crowds of up to 10,000 people here today.
###19 This thing goes off, it's the biggest snowboard competition
###22 in the world.
###23 SHEM ROOSE: The Opens through the '90s were definitely--
###26 they could get out of control.
###28 JEFF BRUSHIE: People had kegs going on the side of the pipe,
###31 people lined up, drinking and screaming.
###34 SHEM ROOSE: I think one of the top highlights from any of the
###36 Opens was the cage.
###37 Everyone talks about the cage.
###39 JEFF BRUSHIE: Some years, people would bring fencing and
###42 make their own little beer cage that only their crew
###46 could be in.
###46 It was crazy.
###48 TRICIA BYRNES: Pat Bridges, Mark Sullivan, all those guys,
###50 they built this like sketchy chicken wire cage with like
###54 two by fours that was not up to code for sure.
###58 And they pretty much just got wasted all day and cheered on
###62 snowboarding.
###63 It was sick.
###64 PAT BRIDGES: So we get up at 5:00 in the morning.
###66 We go up to the bottom of the pipe and we start dragging
###69 these two by fours and all this chicken wire up there.
###71 Then this guy comes up on a snowmobile--
###74 and this is where I think it's all going to come to an end,
###76 and this guy's like, hey, what are you guys doing?
###78 We're like, oh, we're creating a private viewing area for
###81 Burton employees.
###82 And the guy's like, oh really?
###84 Can I get you anything?
###85 You guys need some trash barrels, some
###86 chairs, some tables?
###88 And we're like, we need all of the above.
###89 TOM MONTEROSSO: And my friends and I had absolutely no idea
###92 what was going on.
###93 We saw that there was a bouncer letting
###94 people in and out.
###95 People were partying in it.
###97 And it was just all out mayhem.
###99 If you walked up the left side of the pipe during the Open,
###102 during the contest, you were probably going to drink like
###105 one or two beers every run.
###107 You were going to stop, say hello to a bunch of locals,
###110 friends, and everybody was partying.
###112 And if you needed a break from that, you would walk up the
###114 right side--
###115 which I never did.
###117 It's a serious event, but at the same time, you're partying
###119 with the crowd and you're partying with the other
###121 competitors.
###122 And yeah, left wall.
###126 JEFF BRUSHIE: But there would be dudes hanging out of the
###128 cage going, Brushie!
###131 Get over here!
###134 Trying to drag you in.
###136 Have a drink.
###137 And you're trying to do your runs.
###138 NEIL KORN: There were so many people in there that the cage
###143 just broke.
###145 And where people were standing on the backside
###148 fell off the halfpipe.
###151 PAT BRIDGES: I was thinking that these 60 people on
###153 chicken wire were going to fly down and
###154 take down 3,000 people.
###156 Didn't happen, thank God.
###157 Nobody got hurt.
###158 I mean, there were some incidents.
###161 CRIS DABICA: Pat's one of the greatest snowboarders in the
###163 world, and Pat did eggplants and his weird handplant
###167 variations in that pipe, trashed,
###171 wearing a tiger costume.
###173 And it's hard enough to walk down the road wearing a tiger
###175 costume drunk.
###177 And he was rolling in from the deck doing
###180 inverts in that costume.
###182 And that's just mind-boggling.
###183 BARRY DUGAN: Those are the moments that you can't script.
###187 People going like, we're going to the Open,
###189 let's fill in the blank.
###192 Let's throw up a cage and get some costumes and bring in
###196 stacks of beer and just go for it.
###198 Why not?
###199 TOM MONTEROSSO: And just to see this whole thing unfold, I
###202 mean, I think it's a really big part as to why I kept
###204 snowboarding because I just wanted to constantly feel that
###208 excited about something.
###209 CRIS DABICA: They just went up and acted like they owned the
###211 place and created this thing.
###212 And nobody asked them to take it down.
###214 That, I think, was one of the higher points of participation
###217 from the crowd standpoint.
###219 It was symbolic of the freedom that you had as a
###222 spectator at the event.
###224 The Open doesn't belong to the sponsors,
###226 doesn't belong to Stratton.
###228 It belongs to the people that have come year after year
###230 after year, those 5,000 people that came between the second
###235 they started doing pipe and the end of
###237 that next decade basically.
###240 TERJE HAAKONSEN: Yeah.
###241 It was hilarious.
###242 People climbing up in trees, snowball fights, a lot of
###246 drinking on the side.
###248 A lot of cheering, a lot of shit-talking.
###250 JEFF BRUSHIE: It was sick.
###251 It was like you wanted to ride to please the crowd there.
###255 You wanted to be up over the crowd looking down and people
###259 going yeah.
###261 ANDY COHGLAN: I think that really ups the level of every
###263 competitor.
###264 And that's kind of the legacy of the US Open started by Jeff
###269 Brushie back in the day, I think, in 1990.
###273 He came onto the scene and just started doing big airs.
###277 DANNY KASS: Brushie was just throwing out the illest crails
###280 and just like boning it out.
###283 And it was just like that vibe of this is snowboarding.
###288 There's no rules.
###289 TERJE HAAKONSEN: I rode with Brushie a lot and also he went
###293 the biggest at the time.
###295 I was really influenced by Craig so I was
###299 just going to like--
###300 my philosophy, if I can be as technical as Craig at the time
###302 and go as big as Brush and Palmer, I
###304 would do pretty good.
###305 ANDY COHGLAN: We didn't see Terje at
###308 the Open as a superstar.
###310 When he came, he was definitely one of the up and
###312 coming groms.
###314 But he didn't roll right in and win.
###317 Took a few years.
###320 -Was there a little bit of a grudge match going on?
###322 You came in second to Terje Haakonsen at the World's at
###324 South Lake Tahoe and today, you squeezed him
###327 by 3/10 of a point.
###328 TODD RICHARDS: The only grudge match between Haakon is
###330 because the blasted me in the face with champagne at the
###332 World's, then he ran away from me and I
###334 couldn't get him back.
###335 No, there's no grudge match there.
###336 The only thing that--
###337 that kid just pushes me, pushes me super hard.
###340 His last run was probably one of the most diverse runs I've
###344 seen him do in a long time, and it's rad to see that.
###349 TERJE HAAKONSEN: All the guys I looked up to, they were
###351 really cool to me.
###352 But I know there was a lot of hate from all other guys and I
###354 could totally feel it.
###356 
###359 Jimi Scott was pretty good example.
###360 He was really trying to psych out every newb that came out.
###363 Not only me, but everybody else.
###366 But then you have Palmer and Brushie kind of like helping
###370 you to gain some psychological power against him.
###373 Like Palmer always told me when Jimi drops, you just drop
###377 right after him and go twice as big as him.
###380 He always used to tell me that and Jimi would drop in, and
###383 Palmer would drop, and I would drop.
###385 JAKE BURTON: I think that probably my best Terje moment
###390 at the Open was when I first saw this sticker, the bootleg
###392 sticker that said I saw Terje go fucking
###394 huge at the US Open.
###396 It was great.
###397 Terje really changed the whole thing.
###398 I think he made it more fun and more exciting for
###402 spectators and everybody.
###404 ANDY COHGLAN: He came in and he improved everyone.
###409 And he was one of those riders that everyone started to copy
###413 because not only could he go big, but he was also doing
###415 very technical tricks and really pushed the direction to
###421 where it is today.
###422 DANNY KASS: Because at that time, he was like this god.
###424 We didn't really know much about him.
###427 We just knew that one day, we wanted to be like him.
###431 And we kind of like snuck up from behind and we just
###434 literally just like touched him.
###436 And then he'd turn around, look around.
###438 We'd kind of be like there, like what?
###440 I don't know.
###440 Give him a weird look.
###441 And then he'd turn around again.
###442 Then the next person in the crew would go
###444 up and just be like--
###444 touch.
###446 And then we left, and it was like, that was US Open 1998.
###450 SKY CHALMERS: There's a few photos that really jump out to
###452 me when I think of all the pictures I took at the Open.
###456 One definitely is Terje.
###459 CHRIS COPLEY: We used to do this autograph session in this
###463 courtyard at the Open.
###466 And I mean, it would be mayhem.
###467 There'd be 500, 600 people in this courtyard.
###470 TOM MONTEROSSO: And there's that big kind of clock tower
###472 hotel where all the riders would stay and they would
###475 congregate up on the top floor.
###477 CHRIS COPLEY: And Haakonsen was on like the fifth story.
###482 And he opens up his window and he had his board that he just
###486 won the pipe with.
###487 And he's dangling it out the window.
###489 And he threw the board out the window.
###492 Dude, it was like a riot.
###494 SKY CHALMERS: And then there's a fight.
###496 People were going after the board.
###498 I'm surprised someone didn't get killed.
###500 CHRIS COPLEY: Every cop from down that area was called in
###504 because people were just beating on each other trying
###507 to grab Haakonsen's board.
###508 And that got ugly, and that's where, whew, there were
###513 certain things that--
###514 certain rules got put in place.
###516 BARRY DUGAN: You had this convergence that was pretty
###519 rowdy snowboard-only, not-made-for-TV event.
###524 It was for the snowboarding industry.
###527 And that was pure.
###528 PAT BRIDGES: I mean, it was easy to see what the
###529 importance of the US Open was because it was the Olympics
###532 for freestyle snowboarding before there was an Olympics.
###535 It was the X Games for freestyle snowboarding before
###537 there was an X Games.
###538 And because it really was universal.
###541 You would get everybody of relevance who had a place of
###546 prominence within freestyle snowboarding was there.
###549 TRICIA BYRNES: At that point, you're getting to see like a
###553 bigger international field.
###556 It wasn't on television as much, on the
###557 web, all that stuff.
###558 So people would come out to see these Finnish or crazy
###562 Japanese riders that you'd maybe heard
###564 about but never seen.
###565 And so I feel like there's a lot of firsts at the Open.
###568 -Here he comes in the vert--
###569 huge frontside alley-oop, putting that down smooth.
###573 Just a nice old frontside grind there.
###578 KAZUHIRO KOKUBO: I won two time US Open in
###581 2010 and the 2011.
###583 -[INAUDIBLE] got it going on right now.
###585 Come on, [INAUDIBLE].
###586 -There's the double cork!
###588 Tighten that one down smooth!
###590 It's-- oh!
###591 KAZUHIRO KOKUBO: After that, it's so much better with my
###595 snowboarding.
###596 Yeah, everything is so free.
###601 Yeah, it's so much fun.
###602
