###6 JUDY MESSOLINE: We have pretty bizarre things happen here.
###9 
###12 Most of the people I know down here have seen something
###15 bizarre at one time or another.
###17 
###20 No, we don't discuss it a whole bunch, but they believe.
###22 
###25 They think there's something going on, too.
###27 
###44 My partner and I moved to the San Luis Valley to raise
###46 cattle, did not move here for UFOs, and didn't even realize
###54 that this was a hot spot of the nation for sightings.
###58 And I knew nothing about them anyway.
###60 
###64 Well, then I started meeting some of the locals down here.
###68 And they all had UFO stories--
###70 I mean, one after another after another, even to the
###74 point where there was a real estate company years ago that
###77 would make people who bought land from them sign a
###80 disclaimer saying that they were aware that there was UFO
###85 activity in this valley.
###88 So anyway, it got to the point I'd giggle and say, we need a
###92 UFO watchtower, never ever thinking I'd ever do it.
###96 Well, after four and a half years of struggling with cows,
###99 because they don't eat sand really well,
###102 they about broke me.
###103 So I was talking to one of the farmers one day and I said,
###107 I've had to sell the cows.
###108 I don't want to sell my land.
###110 And he said, you need to put up that UFO watchtower you
###113 giggled about.
###114 You'd have fun.
###115 
###123 It was just going to be a little
###125 old mom and pop business.
###127 We'd be open in the summer, closed in the winter, catch
###130 that tourist traffic off the highway, never thinking we
###137 would ever see anything from here.
###138 I mean, that was not even a vision.
###143 Well, from the time we opened, we started seeing things.
###146 And as of now, and this is November, we have had 67
###155 sightings from just here since we opened.
###157 
###163 One night we had about 60 people over here.
###167 And there was a couple sitting up from on the bench.
###169 And the woman jumps up just screaming.
###172 Do you see them?
###173 Do you see them?
###174 They were so high up that if she hadn't pointed them out, I
###177 would have never seen them.
###178 And there was one here and one here, and they were moving
###181 remarkably fast towards the north.
###183 The one in the front stopped, and it waited for the one
###187 behind to catch up.
###188 And when that one caught up, the two of them took off, and
###191 there was a streak of light across the sky.
###194 Another night it looked like a shooting star, and it was over
###199 here on the other side of the sand dunes.
###202 And it's coming down.
###203 I'm watching this shooting star, OK?
###206 And it gets below the peaks of the mountains, and it lost its
###209 momentum, and it started to float like this.
###212 Well see, that makes sense to my weird mind.
###215 But anyway, what didn't make sense is it went
###218 straight back up.
###219 So it wasn't a shooting star.
###224 So many bizarre things have happened here
###226 in the last 12 years.
###227 And I tell folks, maybe you don't quite get
###233 all of this, OK?
###235 But you better have an open mind, because something's
###237 going on up there in that cosmos, so we
###239 just don't know about.
###241 And do I believe now?
###243 You betcha.
###244 
###253 JAY YOUNG: I've seen some pretty strange things.
###256 I've seen things that I've never even heard of before.
###261 I think there's a lot of things in this universe that
###263 we don't understand, and maybe we're not meant to.
###267 Elvis.
###269 Here, buddy, buddy.
###270 Oh, there he is.
###273 How you doing big dog?
###276 Hey.
###277 [ALLIGATOR HISSING]
###283 JAY YOUNG: How's my big boy?
###284 Yes.
###285 How's my big boy?
###286 I was born in Texas, but I had the good sense to move to
###289 Colorado when I was six months old and been in the valley
###293 almost ever since.
###295 My name is Jay Young, and I'm the manager of Colorado Gators
###299 Reptile Park.
###300 I've known Judy for quite a while, I guess.
###302 I went to the UFO watchtower probably the first
###305 year she opened it.
###307 It was a novel idea.
###308 She knew there was all these sightings in
###310 the San Luis Valley.
###311 And as she's told you, I'm sure, she's seen
###314 things since then.
###316 Do you know about Snippy the horse, right?
###318 First documented animal mutilation, possible UFO
###323 mutilation, happened here in the San Luis Valley back in
###326 the late '60s.
###328 And it was a horse named Snippy the horse.
###331 It was just totally stripped bare.
###333 But where the meat ended on the neck, the flesh was
###337 cauterized.
###338 There was no blood in the horse's body, and there were
###341 no signs of any predators or anything strange around it.
###347 We just found this horse with the flesh
###349 missing off of its head.
###351 And we had an ostrich disappear.
###353 It's missing to this day.
###354 It's been four years now.
###356 Nobody ever saw this ostrich.
###359 So we decided to name him Snippy, if he
###362 ever does show up.
###363 
###368 I think the San Luis Valley probably draws a lot of
###373 supernatural or extraterrestrial activity
###377 possibly because of the geothermal water.
###379 And there's a lot of crazy people here who probably see
###382 things that they didn't actually see, too.
###385 And then, the San Luis Valley draws strange people, so it
###388 might as well draw strange aircraft as well.
###391 
###396 JUDY MESSOLINE: Some say that its the vastness of the
###398 valley, because it's so huge and not highly populated.
###403 Others say it's a spiritually of the valley.
###407 Others say that there's an E.T. base in
###409 Mount Blanca over here.
###411 Well, all of this sounds really good.
###415 But it didn't make sense to my mind.
###418 Then I got a magazine from Great Britain.
###420 And in that magazine it said that the majority of their
###423 sightings was where there were hot water wells.
###426 That makes sense.
###429 From one end to this valley to the other, we
###431 have geothermal water.
###433 
###435 JAY YOUNG: We have very little
###437 atmosphere here at our elevation.
###439 We have very little pollution.
###441 We have very clear skies.
###444 We do a lot of watching just from our front yard.
###448 Judy built a nice place for people to go and hang out that
###453 didn't have a front yard here.
###454 
###465 JUDY MESSOLINE: The folks who come here to visit, first
###469 thing I ask is have you ever had any UFO experiences?
###473 Some will come right out and say, oh yeah.
###475 But folks have made fun of them for
###479 relating their stories.
###482 And I said, how can people do that?
###485 People have these experiences, don't make fun of them.
###489 
###495 DAN: Everyone, whether they're skeptical or not, everybody
###498 wants to think we're not alone.
###501 Yeah, I've seen lights in the sky and objects that seem to
###505 hover and then take off quickly.
###510 AMANDA: I was up in the mountains with
###511 my friend near Denver.
###513 And it was the middle of the day, and we saw something that
###516 was just hovering for a long time.
###517 It was just like an orb that was brightening and dimming.
###521 But it was still for a really long time, and then it moved.
###524 JOE: I just left my house.
###526 I was on my way into town and had some lights coming over
###529 towards us from where Blanca is.
###532 And as it was coming towards us, it seemed to come down,
###535 get brighter and brighter as it was coming down.
###537 It was a pretty good ways up there, though.
###539 And all of a sudden, it went from going straight at us and
###543 took an immediate right and went off and just disappeared
###546 off into the sky.
###548 KENNY: We have what we call the mystery lights.
###551 It's lights we see over top of the mountains,
###553 not moving, not blinking.
###555 So it's not really an airplane or nothing, doesn't look quite
###558 like a star.
###559 So we don't really know what it is, so we just called it
###561 mystery lights.
###563 JAY YOUNG: I'm driving up Highway 17 one night.
###565 I saw three lights off to the left.
###568 And then they went over the mountains in
###573 less than 10 seconds.
###575 I calculated it out that there was no sonic boom from them
###579 taking off, breaking the sound barrier.
###581 So that was strange.
###582 And then I calculated it out.
###584 They were going upwards of 21,000 miles per hour.
###587 JOSH: I've actually never experienced anything.
###589 And I've never seen anything myself in the area.
###592 But I believe it.
###593 In the cities and valley, there's a lot of stuff going
###596 on, a lot of buildings.
###597 But out here in the open, you can really see
###599 everything in the sky.
###601 I'm sure there has been plenty of sightings out here.
###603 There's plenty of room for it.
###605 
###608 JUDY MESSOLINE: If extraterrestrials were mean,
###610 we wouldn't be here, kids.
###613 Because their technology is so much greater than ours.
###617 We wouldn't be here.
###618 
###621 There's a painting over there.
###622 And the woman who did the painting is an abductee.
###625 She has been abducted for, oh gosh, since
###628 she was just a child.
###630 And she's 50 now.
###632 And now she tries to make it a positive experience.
###637 And yeah, she was scared.
###639 But that's human nature.
###640 We're going to be scared about the unknown.
###642 
###646 I used to watch Mulder on TV and stuff.
###649 But as far as really being into it, I was a horse person.
###654 I was not somebody that was out here staring at the sky
###659 all the time.
###660 Now, I wish I would have taken the time to stare at the sky,
###665 because there's some amazing stuff that goes on up there.
###671 You look at all the turmoil that we go through here on
###675 Earth and the changes, and there has to
###679 be something better.
###680
