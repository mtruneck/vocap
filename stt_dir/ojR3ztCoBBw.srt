1
0:0:3,327 --> 0:0:5,687
Can I trade clipboards with you?


2
0:0:5,687 --> 0:0:9,487
OK, fine. But mine's better.


3
0:0:9,487 --> 0:0:14,727
- You wanna trade?
- I guess. OK.


4
0:0:14,727 --> 0:0:18,127
- Elliot, have you seen my clipboard?
- No.


5
0:0:18,127 --> 0:0:23,87
This'll be fun.
JD, I would like you to meet JD.


6
0:0:23,87 --> 0:0:26,527
- How's it going, man?
- Make him leave.


7
0:0:26,527 --> 0:0:29,367
Are you bummed
that we have the same name?


8
0:0:29,367 --> 0:0:33,487
I'll tell you what. You're older
than I am, so you were JD first.


9
0:0:33,487 --> 0:0:35,727
So, how about
you'll be JD Number One,


10
0:0:35,727 --> 0:0:38,207
and I'll just be JD Number Two?


11
0:0:38,207 --> 0:0:40,407
How about that?


12
0:0:40,407 --> 0:0:42,607
Hey, Number Two.


13
0:0:42,607 --> 0:0:45,687
Hey, Number One.
I got one more patient.


14
0:0:45,687 --> 0:0:49,447
You wanna have lunch
and bring my clipboard?


15
0:0:49,447 --> 0:0:51,567
- Hey, Number Two.
- Number One!


16
0:0:51,567 --> 0:0:53,7
All right. Cool.


17
0:0:53,7 --> 0:0:55,207
- Hey, Number Two.
- Number One!


18
0:0:55,207 --> 0:0:58,447
<i>The best part about working here</i>
<i>is the patients,</i>


19
0:0:58,447 --> 0:1:1,407
<i>When they see how much you care</i>
<i>they're grateful,</i>


20
0:1:1,407 --> 0:1:3,687
About time, idiot.


21
0:1:3,687 --> 0:1:6,887
Mr Simon, good morning.
How are you feeling?


22
0:1:6,887 --> 0:1:9,287
I was just asking Nurse Fajita


23
0:1:9,287 --> 0:1:12,247
if you get extra points
for stupid questions.


24
0:1:12,247 --> 0:1:15,527
- I was trying to assess...
- Bambi, don't bother.


25
0:1:15,527 --> 0:1:20,167
Sir, if there's anything we can
do to make your stay more comfortable...


26
0:1:20,167 --> 0:1:22,687
You can kiss my man-sized ass.


27
0:1:22,687 --> 0:1:28,847
Will you hold me after?


28
0:1:28,847 --> 0:1:45,927
Maybe we shouldn't bother.


29
0:1:45,927 --> 0:1:47,847
Hey, Number Two!


30
0:1:47,847 --> 0:1:49,927
- Hey, Number One.
- Hey, Number Two.


31
0:1:49,927 --> 0:1:53,807
Bambi, Mr Simon
made one of the night nurses cry?


32
0:1:53,807 --> 0:1:55,687
- Which one?
- Frank.


33
0:1:55,687 --> 0:1:57,767
Frank was a Navy SEAL.


34
0:1:57,767 --> 0:1:59,847
- Hey, Number Two!
- Hey, Number One.


35
0:1:59,847 --> 0:2:2,127
You are brave.
You're an attending here.


36
0:2:2,127 --> 0:2:4,767
You're dating a student,
and holding hands.


37
0:2:4,767 --> 0:2:8,127
Normally I wouldn't do this,
but there are mitigating factors.


38
0:2:8,127 --> 0:2:12,967
- Like what?
- For starters, you are very hot.


39
0:2:12,967 --> 0:2:16,567
I have kind of a special
evening planned for us.


40
0:2:16,567 --> 0:2:18,767
I'm not gonna
give away everything,


41
0:2:18,767 --> 0:2:22,287
but I will say it involves wine,
an amazing dinner


42
0:2:22,287 --> 0:2:28,607
and a safety word
we've agreed upon in advance.


43
0:2:28,607 --> 0:2:32,367
You are gonna make a great mom!


44
0:2:32,367 --> 0:2:35,367
I told you what to do
if the stitches start to itch.


45
0:2:35,367 --> 0:2:38,7
- Don't scratch.
- Unless they're really itchy.


46
0:2:38,7 --> 0:2:41,407
And then you go to town.
You go nuts. You do your thing.


47
0:2:41,407 --> 0:2:46,447
Dr Reid! One of the nurses found
your stethoscope in the bathroom.


48
0:2:46,447 --> 0:2:48,127
Thank you so much, sir.


49
0:2:48,127 --> 0:2:51,407
This isn't it.
I had them leave yours where it was.


50
0:2:51,407 --> 0:2:56,247
Let's try to be a little
more responsible, shall we?


51
0:2:56,247 --> 0:3:0,87
- I went to college with that guy.
- Lucky you.


52
0:3:0,87 --> 0:3:2,727
Used to play his guitar
every Saturday night


53
0:3:2,727 --> 0:3:5,807
at this coffeehouse off campus.


54
0:3:5,807 --> 0:3:10,567
- Remember the guy's name?
- Robby something, I think.


55
0:3:10,567 --> 0:3:15,247
Dr Kelso's name is Bob, short for Robert
and Robby is a nickname for Robert!


56
0:3:15,247 --> 0:3:16,967
Like, oh, my God!


57
0:3:16,967 --> 0:3:20,887
Give him 30 milligrams of MS Contin.
Why do I have to come with you?


58
0:3:20,887 --> 0:3:23,167
Because you're kinda like a doctor.


59
0:3:23,167 --> 0:3:25,487
He's just another patient.


60
0:3:25,487 --> 0:3:30,447
- Simon says, "Hello!"
- What the hell do you want?


61
0:3:30,447 --> 0:3:34,207
Just gonna have Carla give you
a stronger pain medication.


62
0:3:34,207 --> 0:3:38,767
- Beat it, junior.
- Toodles.


63
0:3:38,767 --> 0:3:41,487
You're all mine.


64
0:3:41,487 --> 0:3:44,607
Me no likey mean guys.


65
0:3:44,607 --> 0:3:48,87
Have you seen my stethoscope?


66
0:3:48,87 --> 0:3:52,327
No. Maybe you left it
in one of the girls' bathrooms.


67
0:3:52,327 --> 0:3:54,127
What?


68
0:3:54,127 --> 0:3:56,127
Is that my stethoscope?


69
0:3:56,127 --> 0:3:58,47
This is mine.


70
0:3:58,47 --> 0:4:1,767
It's getting hot, Red Bird.
Pull me out.


71
0:4:1,767 --> 0:4:3,247
Kristen, slow down.


72
0:4:3,247 --> 0:4:6,127
You've no idea how many times
you'll say that tonight.


73
0:4:6,127 --> 0:4:8,807
- You're making it hard.
- You'll say that too.


74
0:4:8,807 --> 0:4:13,167
Kristen, something has come up,
and I won't be able to make it tonight.


75
0:4:13,167 --> 0:4:15,247
- What?
- I know. I'm sorry.


76
0:4:15,247 --> 0:4:18,127
But it's important.
It's very important.


77
0:4:18,127 --> 0:4:21,87
Thank you for giving me a ride
to pick up my dresser.


78
0:4:21,87 --> 0:4:24,167
- You know I love doing favours.
- You hate doing favours.


79
0:4:24,167 --> 0:4:28,967
I like doing 'em for you. Even though
I am in the best shape of my life,


80
0:4:28,967 --> 0:4:30,847
and I am, by the way.


81
0:4:30,847 --> 0:4:36,887
You could pretty much bounce
a quarter off my butt if you,


82
0:4:36,887 --> 0:4:39,247
if you wanted to.


83
0:4:39,247 --> 0:4:43,287
I don't have any change.


84
0:4:43,287 --> 0:4:47,927
Anyway, I'll probably need your help
getting your dresser up on the roof.


85
0:4:47,927 --> 0:4:50,607
I'm sure you guys can handle it.


86
0:4:50,607 --> 0:4:52,847
I beg your pardon?


87
0:4:52,847 --> 0:4:55,767
This is a sweet ride.
You got seatbelts back here?


88
0:4:55,767 --> 0:5:7,767
No.


89
0:5:7,767 --> 0:5:10,967
You know that dresser
I got for Carla yesterday?


90
0:5:10,967 --> 0:5:19,327
It's not for her place. It's for mine.
Is she moving in? No one asked me.


91
0:5:19,327 --> 0:5:23,47
What the hell is this crap?


92
0:5:23,47 --> 0:5:26,247
It's Dr Kelso!
Mr Sloane dropped the tape off.


93
0:5:26,247 --> 0:5:28,487
Why do you care so much?


94
0:5:28,487 --> 0:5:32,527
It would be so interesting
if there was this whole romantic,


95
0:5:32,527 --> 0:5:36,87
creative, vulnerable side to him.


96
0:5:36,87 --> 0:5:39,527
I think it's a fascinating study
of human behaviour.


97
0:5:39,527 --> 0:5:43,487
I think you're a fascinating study
of human behaviour.


98
0:5:43,487 --> 0:5:52,847
The music's not that bad.


99
0:5:52,847 --> 0:5:55,967
"My Tuscaloosa heart"?


100
0:5:55,967 --> 0:5:59,647
You have to admit,
if that was him, it'd be pretty weird.


101
0:5:59,647 --> 0:6:1,847
You're pretty weird.


102
0:6:1,847 --> 0:6:8,367
- Stop doing that!
- You stop doing that!


103
0:6:8,367 --> 0:6:12,127
<i>Mr Simon's room,</i>


104
0:6:12,127 --> 0:6:14,87
You don't have to hide from him.


105
0:6:14,87 --> 0:6:17,607
I'm not. I have a new exercise programme
called "short bursts".


106
0:6:17,607 --> 0:6:19,847
- Is it working?
- Do you have to ask?


107
0:6:19,847 --> 0:6:22,47
- Yeah.
- Where'd Mr Simon go?


108
0:6:22,47 --> 0:6:25,127
I'm guessing not Heaven.
He died.


109
0:6:25,127 --> 0:6:27,487
- Number Two!
- Number One. What happened?


110
0:6:27,487 --> 0:6:31,527
He had terminal cancer. He went
into respiratory arrest and passed away.


111
0:6:31,527 --> 0:6:32,927
- Number Two!
- Number One.


112
0:6:32,927 --> 0:6:37,447
- Did you give him naloxone?
- We tried intubating him and CPR.


113
0:6:37,447 --> 0:6:39,207
Hey, Number Two!


114
0:6:39,207 --> 0:6:41,727
- He went so fast.
- Say, "Hey, Number One".


115
0:6:41,727 --> 0:6:45,407
- Hey, Number One.
- Hey, Number Two.


116
0:6:45,407 --> 0:6:48,887
<i>It's Kristen,</i>
<i>I missed you tonight,</i>


117
0:6:48,887 --> 0:6:51,927
<i>I went ahead with the date on my own,</i>


118
0:6:51,927 --> 0:6:55,7
<i>But it would've been</i>
<i>almost as fun if you were here,</i>


119
0:6:55,7 --> 0:6:57,407
<i>I wish you were here, See ya,</i>


120
0:6:57,407 --> 0:7:1,807
You are a stupid man.


121
0:7:1,807 --> 0:7:3,887
Honey, I'm home.


122
0:7:3,887 --> 0:7:7,527
You should lock your door.
There's horrible people out there.


123
0:7:7,527 --> 0:7:10,727
There's horrible people right in here.


124
0:7:10,727 --> 0:7:14,727
Maybe you forgot how this works.
When I say that "Hi, honey" thing,


125
0:7:14,727 --> 0:7:18,207
you take your pants off.
Them's the rules of the booty call.


126
0:7:18,207 --> 0:7:21,7
Jordan, believe me,
I enjoy our meaningless


127
0:7:21,7 --> 0:7:24,487
post-divorce sex as much
as the next guy you marry will,


128
0:7:24,487 --> 0:7:27,567
but your timing
could not be worse.


129
0:7:27,567 --> 0:7:31,967
Maybe you don't remember
the terms of our settlement.


130
0:7:31,967 --> 0:7:34,167
When Jordan needs sex,


131
0:7:34,167 --> 0:7:37,847
Jordan gets sex.


132
0:7:37,847 --> 0:7:41,207
Listen, sweet cheeks,
I am seeing someone who...


133
0:7:41,207 --> 0:7:45,607
Let me guess! Dark hair, domineering,
doesn't take any of your crap?


134
0:7:45,607 --> 0:7:48,767
A lesser person would
mock your inability to move on.


135
0:7:48,767 --> 0:7:52,167
I'm gonna consider it an homage.


136
0:7:52,167 --> 0:7:54,567
There is something so


137
0:7:54,567 --> 0:8:0,567
soft about you.


138
0:8:0,567 --> 0:8:5,7
I'm seeing someone right now,
who, by the way, is great,


139
0:8:5,7 --> 0:8:9,687
and yet there's this other woman
who I cannot get out of my head.


140
0:8:9,687 --> 0:8:12,447
She's totally unavailable,
which may be why


141
0:8:12,447 --> 0:8:14,727
I can't get her out of my head.


142
0:8:14,727 --> 0:8:17,647
And maybe,
and this is a whole new theory,


143
0:8:17,647 --> 0:8:20,807
I keep thinking of this other woman,
the unavailable one,


144
0:8:20,807 --> 0:8:23,967
because I am so afraid that
the first thing might work.


145
0:8:23,967 --> 0:8:28,167
And God forbid I ever do something
that might make me happy.


146
0:8:28,167 --> 0:8:31,167
Do you have any idea
what I'm talking about?


147
0:8:31,167 --> 0:8:34,367
If I have to stay here
and listen to this crap,


148
0:8:34,367 --> 0:8:37,47
I'll need a stronger drink.


149
0:8:37,47 --> 0:8:40,607
- I hate you.
- I hate you too.


150
0:8:40,607 --> 0:8:44,487
Fair enough.


151
0:8:44,487 --> 0:8:47,7
I'm sure that was Dr Kelso singing.


152
0:8:47,7 --> 0:8:51,807
It wasn't. Elliot, please. I don't
wanna have this conversation again.


153
0:8:51,807 --> 0:8:54,167
- I think it was him.
- It wasn't.


154
0:8:54,167 --> 0:8:56,247
- But what if it was?
- Good Lord.


155
0:8:56,247 --> 0:8:58,767
Having a late-night tea party, are we?


156
0:8:58,767 --> 0:9:1,647
I guess my invitation
must've been lost in the mail.


157
0:9:1,647 --> 0:9:5,127
As long as I'm here,
I'm partial to Lemon Zinger.


158
0:9:5,127 --> 0:9:8,607
Dr Turk is here cos his patient
is going into surgery tomorrow,


159
0:9:8,607 --> 0:9:11,167
but I was hoping
we could do an ERCP first.


160
0:9:11,167 --> 0:9:16,567
You're breakin' my Tuscaloosa heart.
Just turf him.


161
0:9:16,567 --> 0:9:19,287
"Tuscaloosa heart".


162
0:9:19,287 --> 0:9:32,247
This is what I like to call
my "Told You So" dance.


163
0:9:32,247 --> 0:9:36,87
- You guys awake?
- Holy son-of-a-cracker!


164
0:9:36,87 --> 0:9:39,727
Not now.
Maybe in the morning before work.


165
0:9:39,727 --> 0:9:42,967
Just thought I'd talk to you guys.


166
0:9:42,967 --> 0:9:46,247
JD, when you were a kid,


167
0:9:46,247 --> 0:9:52,407
did you used to walk into your parents'
room in the middle of the night?


168
0:9:52,407 --> 0:9:55,767
Mommy, are you and Daddy
playing wheelbarrow?


169
0:9:55,767 --> 0:9:58,927
Son, go back to bed.
I'm fixing Mommy's back.


170
0:9:58,927 --> 0:10:2,47
- Yes, once.
- Turk, you're not being sensitive.


171
0:10:2,47 --> 0:10:5,727
I'll be sensitive at breakfast, baby.
Turk out.


172
0:10:5,727 --> 0:10:9,767
- What's up, Bambi?
- I can't stop thinking about Mr Simon.


173
0:10:9,767 --> 0:10:12,807
I neglected him
cos he was a jerk and I'm just


174
0:10:12,807 --> 0:10:16,807
- worried that's what killed him.
- Could have been the neglect.


175
0:10:16,807 --> 0:10:19,407
Could've been the terminal cancer.


176
0:10:19,407 --> 0:10:21,527
You're a conscientious doctor.


177
0:10:21,527 --> 0:10:25,727
You'd never do anything
to hurt a patient. You know that.


178
0:10:25,727 --> 0:10:30,7
You're right.


179
0:10:30,7 --> 0:10:32,447
Thank you, Carla.


180
0:10:32,447 --> 0:10:35,447
- Peace out, Turk.
- Night.


181
0:10:35,447 --> 0:10:38,327
<i>We all know what</i>
<i>goes on in the bedroom,,,</i>


182
0:10:38,327 --> 0:10:42,47
- Baby, since we're up...
- No.


183
0:10:42,47 --> 0:10:46,207
<i>,,, but it's also the place</i>
<i>to reflect on what's new in your life,</i>


184
0:10:46,207 --> 0:10:49,87
Tell me about this girl you like.


185
0:10:49,87 --> 0:10:51,967
<i>But most importantly</i>
<i>it's where you can lie back</i>


186
0:10:51,967 --> 0:10:59,607
<i>let everything go</i>
<i>and finally just sleep,</i>


187
0:10:59,607 --> 0:11:3,7
<i>Or not,</i>


188
0:11:3,7 --> 0:11:5,927
<i>So you got a good</i>
<i>nine minutes of sleep last night,</i>


189
0:11:5,927 --> 0:11:10,327
<i>Remember it's a new day, Yesterday's</i>
<i>gone and it's never coming back,</i>


190
0:11:10,327 --> 0:11:13,647
- Bambi, about yesterday...
- It's back?


191
0:11:13,647 --> 0:11:17,287
They want you to present Mr Simon
at an M and M conference.


192
0:11:17,287 --> 0:11:20,407
<i>Morbidity and Mortality conferences</i>
<i>are fun meetings</i>


193
0:11:20,407 --> 0:11:24,127
<i>when they think you might be</i>
<i>responsible for a patient's death,</i>


194
0:11:24,127 --> 0:11:26,527
Bambi, don't be nervous.


195
0:11:26,527 --> 0:11:31,527
Is it hot in here?
It's like, it's hot!


196
0:11:31,527 --> 0:11:35,287
No, I'm fine.


197
0:11:35,287 --> 0:11:40,87
<i>There's no reason to start</i>
<i>obsessing, You did nothing wrong,</i>


198
0:11:40,87 --> 0:11:43,487
Morning, killer.


199
0:11:43,487 --> 0:11:47,47
Have a good one, killer.


200
0:11:47,47 --> 0:11:48,967
- Hey, Number Two!
- Number One.


201
0:11:48,967 --> 0:11:51,687
- Hey, Number Two!
- Stop doing that.


202
0:11:51,687 --> 0:11:54,367
- Look, Number One...
- Number Two.


203
0:11:54,367 --> 0:11:59,127
We have the same name, but I can't
spend my day playing this game.


204
0:11:59,127 --> 0:12:4,247
I'm sorry.


205
0:12:4,247 --> 0:12:7,887
Hey, Number Two?


206
0:12:7,887 --> 0:12:9,967
- Hey, you.
- You got a minute?


207
0:12:9,967 --> 0:12:13,967
You know what would make surgery
quicker? If we didn't have to be clean.


208
0:12:13,967 --> 0:12:18,127
Listen, I gotta say something
to you here.


209
0:12:18,127 --> 0:12:20,767
You are so great. You know?


210
0:12:20,767 --> 0:12:24,87
You're sexy, you're smart,
God knows you're dangerous.


211
0:12:24,87 --> 0:12:26,407
- You think I'm a spy?
- No.


212
0:12:26,407 --> 0:12:28,487
Look, I just want you to know


213
0:12:28,487 --> 0:12:31,727
that I haven't been
in this relationship 100%,


214
0:12:31,727 --> 0:12:36,647
and it's because of how great you are
and how much that scares me.


215
0:12:36,647 --> 0:12:40,7
But, from now on, if you want,


216
0:12:40,7 --> 0:12:43,7
sister, you're gonna be
getting the whole shebang.


217
0:12:43,7 --> 0:12:46,927
Cos I'm all in, baby.


218
0:12:46,927 --> 0:12:49,7
Bring it. Ka-bow-bow.


219
0:12:49,7 --> 0:12:51,647
Yeah, you come here
with the ka-bow-bow.


220
0:12:51,647 --> 0:12:54,327
<i>My Bunny is a Baby Blue</i>


221
0:12:54,327 --> 0:12:58,7
<i>Bunny How Things Change</i>
<i>B- U-N-N-Y Spells Love to Me?</i>


222
0:12:58,7 --> 0:13:1,567
Ten songs about Bunny,
not one song about his wife.


223
0:13:1,567 --> 0:13:5,47
It's impossible to write
a love song about anyone named Enid.


224
0:13:5,47 --> 0:13:10,87
Don't you get it? This tape
shows exactly why Kelso is Kelso.


225
0:13:10,87 --> 0:13:14,247
He used to be this beautiful,
wonderful, sweet, caring man.


226
0:13:14,247 --> 0:13:17,807
He found the love of his life,
and she slips through his hands?


227
0:13:17,807 --> 0:13:20,127
That is so sad.


228
0:13:20,127 --> 0:13:25,767
Have you guys ever stopped to think
that maybe Bunny is just a real bunny?


229
0:13:25,767 --> 0:13:29,327
That's just stupid.


230
0:13:29,327 --> 0:13:32,447
Yeah, I know.


231
0:13:32,447 --> 0:13:35,127
<i>I'm OK,</i>


232
0:13:35,127 --> 0:13:38,127
<i>I'm OK, I'm a "K",</i>


233
0:13:38,127 --> 0:13:40,807
<i>I'm a "'K"?</i>
<i>What the hell does that mean?</i>


234
0:13:40,807 --> 0:13:45,567
Dr Dorian, we have examined
Aaron Simon's file.


235
0:13:45,567 --> 0:13:54,87
Before we begin,
do you have any last words?


236
0:13:54,87 --> 0:13:55,327
I'm a "K".


237
0:13:55,327 --> 0:13:58,807
That was terrible.
Can I have a do-over?


238
0:13:58,807 --> 0:14:3,167
Initially there were concerns that
Mr Simon may have been overmedicated.


239
0:14:3,167 --> 0:14:6,167
We have concluded
that his pain control


240
0:14:6,167 --> 0:14:9,407
was both adequate
and well within normal limits.


241
0:14:9,407 --> 0:14:11,527
Thank you for stopping by.


242
0:14:11,527 --> 0:14:14,607
Sir, I am not sure
how this thing usually works,


243
0:14:14,607 --> 0:14:17,847
but I was kinda hoping
we could take a closer look at me.


244
0:14:17,847 --> 0:14:21,207
I've been sort of
doubting my performance,


245
0:14:21,207 --> 0:14:24,247
and it would be really helpful
if we could just all


246
0:14:24,247 --> 0:14:30,967
talk about it as a group.


247
0:14:30,967 --> 0:14:34,47
<i>Dr Kelso isn't looking</i>
<i>to do me any favours,</i>


248
0:14:34,47 --> 0:14:38,327
<i>If I did something wrong</i>
<i>he'd call me on it,</i>


249
0:14:38,327 --> 0:14:42,887
<i>Then how come I still can't sleep?</i>


250
0:14:42,887 --> 0:14:45,407
- My God.
- I know. I didn't do it.


251
0:14:45,407 --> 0:14:47,247
Joy.


252
0:14:47,247 --> 0:14:51,527
I told you when he saw us together he'd
fold his arms and do the teeth thing.


253
0:14:51,527 --> 0:14:54,167
He did the same
the first time I saw him naked.


254
0:14:54,167 --> 0:14:56,47
No way, same here.


255
0:14:56,47 --> 0:14:59,407
This is beyond horrible.


256
0:14:59,407 --> 0:15:1,487
Relax. I came by for a board meeting


257
0:15:1,487 --> 0:15:4,127
and to meet the new lady
in your life and warn her.


258
0:15:4,127 --> 0:15:6,247
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


259
0:15:6,247 --> 0:15:8,47
Kristen,


260
0:15:8,47 --> 0:15:10,807
this is my emotional baggage.


261
0:15:10,807 --> 0:15:13,207
Baggage, Kristen.


262
0:15:13,207 --> 0:15:15,127
Be nice.


263
0:15:15,127 --> 0:15:18,727
I wanted to thank you for helping
with that dresser last night.


264
0:15:18,727 --> 0:15:24,567
- Sure, no problem.
- He's a great guy.


265
0:15:24,567 --> 0:15:28,647
- That's why you blew me off?
- I should leave.


266
0:15:28,647 --> 0:15:33,167
Moving furniture with that nurse
you have a crush on? That's your 100%?


267
0:15:33,167 --> 0:15:36,527
No! The 100% came well after that.


268
0:15:36,527 --> 0:15:39,767
Her boyfriend was there the entire time.


269
0:15:39,767 --> 0:15:44,367
And bailing on you is far and away
the best thing that could have happened,


270
0:15:44,367 --> 0:15:48,207
because it made me realise
that I was sabotaging myself again.


271
0:15:48,207 --> 0:15:51,167
If you don't believe me, ask Jordan.


272
0:15:51,167 --> 0:15:56,527
Would you please tell her what I said to
you right before you left this morning?


273
0:15:56,527 --> 0:16:3,247
Left where?


274
0:16:3,247 --> 0:16:7,327
You're unbelievable.


275
0:16:7,327 --> 0:16:11,247
That's too bad. I liked her.


276
0:16:11,247 --> 0:16:13,367
I did too.


277
0:16:13,367 --> 0:16:16,207
Dear God.


278
0:16:16,207 --> 0:16:19,47
Why don't we just say something to him?


279
0:16:19,47 --> 0:16:20,807
- Like what?
- I don't know.


280
0:16:20,807 --> 0:16:23,847
"I heard your songs
and they're extraordinary"?


281
0:16:23,847 --> 0:16:25,447
Elliot, don't.


282
0:16:25,447 --> 0:16:28,727
- I won't.
- Pinkie swear.


283
0:16:28,727 --> 0:16:31,967
I heard your songs
and they're extraordinary!


284
0:16:31,967 --> 0:16:33,567
Excuse me?


285
0:16:33,567 --> 0:16:35,767
You swore!


286
0:16:35,767 --> 0:16:38,447
You know what? Just forget it.


287
0:16:38,447 --> 0:16:41,767
We won't bother you any more.


288
0:16:41,767 --> 0:16:46,7
Sir, whatever happened to Bunny?
We gotta know.


289
0:16:46,7 --> 0:16:49,247
Actually, the music came before Bunny.


290
0:16:49,247 --> 0:16:53,887
I learned to play the guitar growing up
as a young rapscallion in Mississippi.


291
0:16:53,887 --> 0:16:56,847
But things didn't take off
until I moved to Memphis.


292
0:16:56,847 --> 0:16:59,887
Then I met the Colonel,
and the hits just kept coming.


293
0:16:59,887 --> 0:17:4,767
But it went to my head. I gained a lot
of weight, started wearing jumpsuits


294
0:17:4,767 --> 0:17:8,287
and ate tranquillisers
like they were trail mix.


295
0:17:8,287 --> 0:17:11,927
Then, in 1977, I died on the toilet.


296
0:17:11,927 --> 0:17:13,887
Or did I?


297
0:17:13,887 --> 0:17:17,727
- You never played the guitar?
- That crap is for hippies!


298
0:17:17,727 --> 0:17:21,247
Now, for God's sake, get back to work.


299
0:17:21,247 --> 0:17:24,127
Thank you very much.


300
0:17:24,127 --> 0:17:27,407
<i>I always turn</i>
<i>to the person I trust the most,</i>


301
0:17:27,407 --> 0:17:31,847
<i>Cos I know when he says I didn't</i>
<i>do anything wrong I'll believe it,</i>


302
0:17:31,847 --> 0:17:34,607
Looks like you screwed
the pooch there.


303
0:17:34,607 --> 0:17:37,127
- I didn't overmedicate him.
- You didn't.


304
0:17:37,127 --> 0:17:39,207
I always check your orders.


305
0:17:39,207 --> 0:17:43,447
But if you're wondering whether
or not you treated Mr Simon differently


306
0:17:43,447 --> 0:17:45,687
because he's a complete jerk, well,


307
0:17:45,687 --> 0:17:48,527
I think you know the answer
to that one.


308
0:17:48,527 --> 0:17:52,687
- Depends what you mean by "different".
- I have to warn you, I just got dumped


309
0:17:52,687 --> 0:17:59,207
in front of my ex-wife,
not ten minutes ago.


310
0:17:59,207 --> 0:18:3,567
It's always easy to treat
the nice ones nice, isn't it?


311
0:18:3,567 --> 0:18:6,487
But your drug addicts,
your child abusers,


312
0:18:6,487 --> 0:18:11,287
your garden-variety jerks...


313
0:18:11,287 --> 0:18:15,127
You know, it's barely misting out.


314
0:18:15,127 --> 0:18:17,407
It's my hair. If it even gets damp,


315
0:18:17,407 --> 0:18:20,887
it frizzes out and becomes
wildly unmanageable.


316
0:18:20,887 --> 0:18:25,527
- Mine too.
- It was a joke, ya girl.


317
0:18:25,527 --> 0:18:30,127
Newbie, the only way
to judge your growth as a doctor,


318
0:18:30,127 --> 0:18:32,207
hell, as a human being,


319
0:18:32,207 --> 0:18:40,447
is by making sure you don't repeat
the same mistakes over and over.


320
0:18:40,447 --> 0:18:44,927
That was really great, but next time,
would you not look me in the eye?


321
0:18:44,927 --> 0:18:47,527
It gets in the way
of what I come here to do.


322
0:18:47,527 --> 0:18:50,687
Then stop turnin' around.


323
0:18:50,687 --> 0:18:52,887
- That's classy.
- Wait a minute.


324
0:18:52,887 --> 0:18:57,687
You don't have to go,
you know, if you don't want to.


325
0:18:57,687 --> 0:19:3,47
- Are you really that lonely?
- Kinda, yeah.


326
0:19:3,47 --> 0:19:7,767
All right. I'll toss you
a quickie, but no talking.


327
0:19:7,767 --> 0:19:11,687
- I'll talk if I want to.
- Be quiet.


328
0:19:11,687 --> 0:19:14,927
<i>The worst thing about being a doctor</i>

No, I forgot.

0:19:57,167 --> 0:20:0,407
Yeah. No, yeah.
I'll do it as soon as I get home.

344
0:20:4,247 --> 0:20:12,247

0:20:23,327 --> 0:20:25,287
Nothing.


349
0:20:25,287 --> 0:20:28,47
Gotta be boobs somewhere.


350
0:20:28,47 --> 0:20:32,47
Nothing.


351
0:20:32,47 --> 0:20:35,567
Jackpot.


352
0:20:35,567 --> 0:20:41,447

353
0:20:41,447 --> 0:22:41,447
Hmm.
