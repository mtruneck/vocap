###1 BEN ANDERSON: This is Pharmacy Road, which some people say is
###4 the most lethal road in the world.
###7 It's also here that their British had their biggest
###10 single loss of life when five soldiers from two rifles were
###16 killed in one IED blast.
###18 
###24 AMERICAN SOLDIER: With IEDs, it's all luck.
###26 I've been really I haven't stepped on one, and a couple
###29 of people have just stepped in the wrong spot
###31 at the wrong time.
###32 MALE SPEAKER: Are we good?
###32 [EXPLOSION]
###35 
###40 AMERICAN SOLDIER: Is anybody hit?
###41 AMERICAN SOLDIER: Is anyone hit?
###42 
###47 AMERICAN SOLDIER: Can you stand up?
###48 MALE SPEAKER: Huh?
###48 AMERICAN SOLDIER: Can you see?
###49 MALE SPEAKER: Huh?
###49 AMERICAN SOLDIER: Can you stand up?
###50 
###54 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###55 MALE SPEAKER: What?
###55 AMERICAN SOLDIER: Hold on to me.
###56 Let's go.
###57 
###77 MICHAEL HASTINGS: Well, first off, I just want to thank
###79 Powerhouse for having us here.
###80 This is one of my favorite spots in all of the greater
###83 Tri-State Area.
###85 They have a bunch of great events.
###87 And it's really an honor to be here.
###90 So Ben is someone whose work I've respected and admired for
###94 its bravery, its courage, and also his willingness to get
###98 shot at in many places around the globe.
###101 So Ben's book, "No Worse Enemy." you're
###103 a documentary filmmaker.
###105 Why did you decide to write the book?
###110 BEN ANDERSON: Originally I had no intention to write a book.
###113 It was just one documentary at a time, mostly for the BBC,
###115 then HBO, then BBC again.
###117 But about 18 months ago, the statements were coming out of
###121 Kabul, London, and Washington about how progress was being
###124 made, our goals were being met, the Afghans were almost
###127 ready to take over so we could leave with
###129 our heads held high.
###130 And I feel that's the exact opposite of what I'd been
###132 seeing for the last five years.
###135 I never believed it when an author said, I
###136 had to write a book.
###137 But suddenly, I thought, I have to write this book.
###139 I have to get everything I've seen and filmed down on paper
###142 in one place.
###143 And apart from literally a handful of quotes in here from
###145 my notebooks, it's all from my own footage.
###147 So it's not my opinion.
###149 I'm not exaggerating.
###151 it's a really simple portrait of what the war actually looks
###154 like, because that's so different to the war that
###156 we're being told is going on now.
###158 MICHAEL HASTINGS: Now the strategy that we have is the
###161 reason we could pull out, in theory, because there's the
###165 Afghan national security forces, the
###166 police, and the army.
###167 You have a clip, I think, that demonstrates the equality of--
###173 I feel like it's easy to bash the Afghans, and especially in
###178 the US, we often do that.
###180 You'll read the "New York Times well, everything would
###181 be going well in the Afghanistan War if the Afghans
###184 weren't such fuck-ups.
###186 At the same time, you have this great clip.
###188 Why don't you introduce the clip, and we'll start with
###189 that to give us a flavor of the real war that
###193 you don't often see.
###195 BEN ANDERSON: OK.
###195 This clip is from my first trip to Afghanistan in 2007,
###198 and it's not an exceptional clip at all.
###201 We'd been under attack for about six hours.
###205 A Hellfire missile had struck a building-- the wrong
###207 building by mistake, where British and
###208 Afghan soldiers were.
###209 We thought they'd been killed.
###211 So we ran across a field under Taliban fire into this
###214 building to check on these guys.
###215 Found out they were all OK, miraculously.
###217 The British responded by saying, this is the most
###221 intense day of fighting they'd ever had.
###222 The Afghans responded by skinning up a huge joint.
###225 And you'll see what happens next.
###228 BRITISH SOLDIER: I don't understand how they could
###229 smoke it in the middle of a battle.
###231 It'd make you worse.
###232 But they love it.
###233 As soon as they get two minutes, then they'll start
###235 smoking and passing it around.
###237 All laughing and joking.
###238 And then a minute later, they're
###240 running out towards bullets.
###241 BEN ANDERSON: But I thought it might make them more cautious.
###243 BRITISH SOLDIER: Yeah.
###243 It would make me more cautious.
###246 BEN ANDERSON: But apparently it has the opposite effect.
###248 BRITISH SOLDIER: Yeah.
###249 They love it.
###250 BEN ANDERSON: So the Afghan--
###252 they got stoned for about an hour.
###254 They were completely out of control.
###254 One of them had eyes pointing different directions.
###256 And he actually ran out and he was so stoned that he was just
###259 aiming at something in the sky.
###260 And I don't know if you saw it, but a bullet came and shot
###263 the top cover off his rifle, which was pretty funny, when
###267 you look at that footage.
###267 But afterwards, we thought, actually, a few inches up and
###270 we'd have seen a guy getting his head blown off
###272 right next to us.
###273 And it is difficult to bash the Afghan National Army.
###276 The Afghan National Police, I'm actually happy to bash.
###278 They're hate and feared by the local population.
###281 I spoke to one of the Northern Irish guys training the Afghan
###284 National Police, and he said 90% of the crime in Helmand is
###287 committed by the police.
###290 And bear in mind that the counterinsurgency policy is,
###293 we're trying to persuade the Afghans to choose us and the
###295 Afghan security forces over the Taliban.
###298 It's no surprise that lots of people in the south are going
###301 to choose the Taliban, and see the Taliban as the good guys.
###304 MICHAEL HASTINGS: One of the incredible moments in your
###306 book, when you're sort of explaining your reporting
###309 techniques, you said you went through and had what the
###313 Afghans said translated versus what people thought they said
###317 at the time, and there were big discrepancies.
###318 Can you talk about this sort of lost in translation aspect
###321 of the conflict?
###323 BEN ANDERSON: First of I was always shocked by how few
###326 American and British forces learned Pashto or Dari.
###329 And most of that is because they do six-month tours.
###332 And you can't learn about a local culture and establish
###335 relations in six months.
###336 But for some reason, the interpreters they employ would
###340 often mistranslate things.
###341 So there was a meeting with a mullah in Sangin where he came
###344 out of his mosque.
###344 And he lived about 100 meters away from a US base.
###346 So if anyone's benefiting from our presence there,
###349 it should be him.
###350 And he came out, and he said,
###351 yesterday you shot my daughter.
###352 A stray bullet hit her in the shoulder.
###353 And you wouldn't let us through the checkpoint.
###355 We had to take her to hospital.
###356 It took seven hours.
###358 How do you expect us to embrace you when this is how
###360 you treat us?
###361 The translation was, we're very glad you're here,
###363 security's improved, and my kids can play outside.
###366 And I had no idea of this until I got back to London and
###369 sat down with a really good translator and went through
###370 all of my tapes, one by one.
###373 MICHAEL HASTINGS: That's incredible.
###374 Now, you mentioned just briefly the old man who
###378 brought his daughter who'd been shot.
###380 Can you talk a little bit about the solatia payments, or
###383 the payments we actually make to Afghan civilians, the
###387 families of Afghan civilians who die?
###390 BEN ANDERSON: Every time there are civilian casualties,
###392 there's a condolence payment meeting the next day.
###394 And the British actually pay less than the Americans, but
###396 the Americans pay $2,500 per life lost.
###400 AMERICAN SOLDIER: There's nothing we can do to bring
###403 back your loss.
###404 What we can do is try to help you out by giving you the very
###415 least that we can with a payment for your losses.
###422 
###427 AMERICAN SOLDIER: And again, I'm, I'm deeply, deeply sorry.
###432 AMERICAN SOLDIER: Gentlemen, this is for you.
###435 For your losses.
###439 MICHAEL HASTINGS: What do you think's going through that
###442 guy's mind, when he's hearing this from foreigners?
###444 And what do you think he did afterwards?
###446 You think he joined the Taliban or just
###451 went on with his life?
###452 BEN ANDERSON: I spent a lot of time in Marja after the that
###454 incident, and surprisingly, he forgave the Marines.
###457 I think he realized it was a mistake, and he had a very
###459 good relationship with the Marines.
###460 And the thing he was most angry about at that meeting,
###463 initially, was that McChrystal and everybody had made a big--
###466 Marja was announced months in advance, so the Taliban had
###468 months to prepare.
###470 They built incredible networks of bunkers and trenches and
###473 set booby traps everywhere.
###475 But they said to the civilians, we're not going to
###477 use any rockets that can pierce the thick walls of your
###479 house, so stay indoors.
###481 Don't flee.
###482 We're here to protect you.
###483 And he said, I did what you told me to do.
###485 I waited inside my house for four days.
###487 All you had to do was shout, and I would have walked
###490 towards you.
###491 And then there was nothing but you and the Taliban.
###493 And that's what he was most mad about, was he'd done
###495 exactly what he was told to do, and he still lost four
###497 family members as a result.
###501 MICHAEL HASTINGS: The IED, the Improvised Explosive Device,
###507 it's what terrorizes both, I think, NATO troops and also
###513 local civilians.
###515 Can you set up this next clip for us?
###517 Feel free to talk about your own experience, obviously,
###519 with the improvised explosive device.
###522 BEN ANDERSON: The last clip is from Sangin, which is probably
###525 the town in the whole of Afghanistan, outside of Kabul,
###528 which has had more manpower and resources devoted to it
###530 for longer than anywhere else.
###532 And this was my last trip to Afghanistan
###534 with Three Five Marines.
###535 And the IED threat was so bad that it took four hours to
###539 walk two kilometers on a patrol.
###541 You had to walk in single file, and you literally had to
###544 walk in the bootprints of the minesweeper in front of you.
###546 
###550 The man at the end of the command wire has let us walk
###553 over the daisy chain.
###555 He knows there are more Marines coming behind.
###559 AMERICAN SOLDIER: Hey, we're going to have to get
###560 on the other one.
###562 AMERICAN SOLDIER: [INAUDIBLE] good?
###563 [EXPLOSION]
###565 
###569 AMERICAN SOLDIER: Is anybody hit?
###570 AMERICAN SOLDIER: Is anyone hit?
###571 
###575 BEN ANDERSON: Five of the seven bombs went off.
###578 AMERICAN SOLDIER: See where it's at?
###580 It was right there.
###581 BEN ANDERSON: Just seconds after we had walked over them.
###584 AMERICAN SOLDIER: Can you stand up?
###586 MALE SPEAKER: Huh?
###586 AMERICAN SOLDIER: Can you see?
###587 MALE SPEAKER: Huh?
###588 AMERICAN SOLDIER: Can you stand up?
###589 MALE SPEAKER: He can't hear you.
###592 MICHAEL HASTINGS: Again, incredible footage.
###593 This is the first time I've watched an IED go off in a
###595 while because I can't even watch this shit.
###596 What keeps bringing you back there?
###599 Are they noble reasons?
###600 Are they selfish reasons?
###601 Are they adrenaline reasons?
###603 
###606 BEN ANDERSON: It's certainly not adrenaline.
###607 I mean, people who say that that is a thrill I don't think
###610 have really experienced it or been close to real ambushes or
###613 firefights.
###615 
###618 It's hard, because once you've covered this stuff for a
###620 while, other stories--
###622 I mean, I try and cover the Republican nomination, I try
###625 and follow British politics, and it just feels boring.
###629 This, to me, feels like one of the most important
###631 stories in the world.
###634 And now, when you ask me a question
###636 like that, it's scary.
###638 But when you're out there, you compare yourself to everyone
###641 around you.
###642 And the people around me have to kill people.
###643 They maybe have to save their friends lives.
###645 I don't have to do either of those things.
###647 And the civilians around me, the ones who are too poor to
###650 leave, they're really suffering.
###652 I mean, compared to all of those people,
###654 I'm kind of a VIP.
###655 I've got a cushy job, compared to them.
###658 So that makes me think I can keep on going
###661 back and doing more.
###662 And I really want to know what happens out there.
###665 I'm not at all optimistic about the future, but I really
###668 want to know how it turns out.
###669 And sadly, there aren't that many people
###671 covering this anymore.
###672 MICHAEL HASTINGS: Can you describe the process of you
###675 with the camera?
###676 BEN ANDERSON: Everything I'd need, I carry on my back.
###680 And that means that I can join an infantry group like these
###682 guys and stay with them for five or six weeks.
###685 And if I sleep where they sleep and run the same risks
###687 they run and eat what they eat, they open up to me.
###690 And the goal is to film exactly what the war really
###693 looks like.
###694 And I'm sure it's impossible with me being there.
###696 I'm sure they temper their behavior slightly because I'm
###699 there, but I think I've got quite close to seeing how they
###701 would have behaved if I wasn't there.
###703 
###706 MICHAEL HASTINGS: Great.
###706 Well, I want to again thank Powerhouse for having us in,
###711 and also you all for coming out and for
###714 being engaged in this--
###715 
###718 obviously, we spend $120 billion on it a year.
###721 I think over a thousand Americans have died there
###723 since President Obama's been elected, not to mention the
###726 thousands of Afghan civilians.
###729 So on that cheerful note, I want to recommend Ben's book
###733 very highly.
###734 As a fellow author who does these things, if you come,
###738 please buy the book.
###739 Come on.
###739 Just shell out for the fucking thing.
###741 We're here, he'll sign it for you.
###744 It'll be good.
###745 I'll buy your book when it comes out too.
###746 Just email me.
###749 And just thanks again.
###751 This has been a really, I think, hopefully a thoughtful,
###753 fruitful discussion.
###754 And Ben's one of the best journalists, documentary
###757 filmmakers, who's out there working today.
###759 So I'd like to give Ben a round of applause
###762 and call it a night.
###763 [APPLAUSE]
###785 AMERICAN SOLDIER: This is life in Afghanistan, see.
###787
