0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,797
Say what you will about the
healthcare system in this country,


2
0:0:2,797 --> 0:0:6,808
but when they're afraid of lawsuits,
they sure test everything.


3
0:0:6,808 --> 0:0:12,223
I really don't think
the colonoscopy was necessary.


4
0:0:12,223 --> 0:0:14,198
You know, before you got all swollen up,


5
0:0:14,198 --> 0:0:16,994
I actually thought you were trying
to keep me out of the apartment


6
0:0:16,994 --> 0:0:19,749
so you could throw me a surprise party.


7
0:0:19,749 --> 0:0:22,584
Right, it's your birthday.
I had no idea it was your birthday.


8
0:0:22,584 --> 0:0:25,186
I completely forgot.
What a lousy way to spend a birthday.


9
0:0:25,186 --> 0:0:30,506
It's all over now.


10
0:0:30,506 --> 0:0:33,1
There is a party, isn't there?


11
0:0:33,1 --> 0:0:37,385
Maybe.


12
0:0:37,385 --> 0:0:40,857
- Are you mad?
- How could I be mad?


13
0:0:40,857 --> 0:0:45,789
You actually risked your life
because you care about me.


14
0:0:45,789 --> 0:0:50,54
Yeah, that's why I did it.


15
0:0:50,54 --> 0:0:52,303
All right.


16
0:0:52,303 --> 0:0:54,392
Here we go.


17
0:0:54,392 --> 0:1:6,401
My first birthday party.


18
0:1:6,401 --> 0:1:7,98
Dude,


19
0:1:7,98 --> 0:1:12,418
everybody left an hour ago.


20
0:1:12,418 --> 0:1:18,2
Surprise!


21
0:1:18,2 --> 0:1:21,359
Okay, Leonard.
I am at your birthday party.


22
0:1:21,359 --> 0:1:25,428
I don't know where you are,
dude, but it's really kick-ass!


23
0:1:25,428 --> 0:1:30,417
Everyone is very, very drunk and...


24
0:1:30,417 --> 0:1:35,0
And look,
there's a girl taking her shirt off!


25
0:1:35,0 --> 0:1:36,951
That's my friend Carol.


26
0:1:36,951 --> 0:1:40,144
Remind me,
I gotta introduce her to Howard.


27
0:1:40,144 --> 0:1:45,694
Oh, sweet Krishna,
shake that rupee maker!


28
0:1:45,694 --> 0:1:48,42
I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.


29
0:1:48,42 --> 0:1:51,872
It's okay.


30
0:1:51,872 --> 0:2:1,901
Happy birthday, anyways.


31
0:2:1,901 --> 0:4:1,901
When's your birthday?
