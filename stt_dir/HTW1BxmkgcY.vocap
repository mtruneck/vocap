###11 BRYAN IGUCHI: Today we're going to go take some
###13 snowmobiles out and try to build a couple jumps, or at
###17 least build a jump.
###19 Try and get a couple jump shots.
###21 Working on a photo shoot for Volcom right now.
###25 Kind of doing like a little web edit little
###29 short for the internet.
###31 And then just shooting photos for a TransWorld magazine
###35 story on Jackson Hole.
###38 KEVIN JONES: Once again, Guch is taking the early steps.
###42 Like, OK, I'm going to go get certified to be a guide.
###46 I'm going to spend most my time with my head in the snow
###49 pit, figuring out what kind of snow crystal is morphing with
###51 another one, which is all knowledge that the future of
###56 snowboarding is going to have to have if they want to go to
###58 these places in the back country and be alive
###60 to tell about it.
###62 
###101 KEVIN JONES: I mean, to this day, he snowboards more than
###102 anybody I know.
###104 And he loves it more than anybody I know.
###106 It can be a really shitty run.
###108 And Guch is fired up like, that was so sick.
###111 And you're like, yeah, I guess it was sick.
###113 
###121 [SNOWMOBILE  ENGINE REVVING]
###134 KEVIN JONES: There's nobody, that I, one, on a stoke level
###138 would want to ride with and, two, just on an overall safety
###142 factor would want to ride with.
###144 The guy is just truly a bad ass.
###147 And there's no one else like him.
###149 
###154 BILLY ANDERSON: We keep getting older, but they all
###156 stay the same age.
###157 So it's like everyone's coming up, and they're running into
###161 the same challenges year after year after year.
###164 And if we can bring authentic experience to our team, it's
###169 just huge value for us.
###171 I mean, Guch has been there and lived through his mistakes
###175 and grown from them.
###176 And if we can have those guys around to mentor the next
###179 generation, it's just going to make them better people,
###182 better snowboarders.
###183 And that's extremely valuable to us.
###188 
###191 [SNOWMOBILE  ENGINE REVVING]
###198 BRYAN FOX: For me, being on a trip with Travis, and having
###200 him talk about Iguchi, is still--
###204 I've never met Bryan Iguchi.
###206 And when he talks about them it's still like that little
###208 kid, you know where, that's crazy.
###212 You know that guy.
###214 That's weird to say, because I'm an adult and that shit
###217 doesn't matter at all, it's just some guy.
###220 But it's still like you get that, like, that's crazy.
###223 You casually hang out with this guy who you still just
###228 hold him on this little pedestal.
###229 Like, fucking this guy's cool as shit, no matter what.
###232 
###237 BRYAN IGUCHI: Fuck!
###240 VERNON: [INAUDIBLE].
###241 JAKE PRICE: That was sick, though.
###243 VERNON: Yeah.
###244 JAKE PRICE: Yeah, watching Guch ride is better than going
###246 and building a jump, Vernon.
###249 Let the other guys do all the bitch work.
###251 And we'll just show up and film it.
###254 BRYAN IGUCHI: Want more?
###255 JAKE PRICE: Yeah.
###255 BRYAN IGUCHI: OK.
###256 JAKE PRICE: Or a couple more.
###259 BRYAN IGUCHI: OK.
###261 JAKE PRICE: Like I said, we don't have to build a jump.
###263 We can sit here and watch him ride.
###265 [SNOWMOBILE  ENGINE REVVING]
###270 KEVIN JONES: The last couple years I got the ride with
###271 Bryan a bunch.
###272 And it's not about going out and getting the raddest
###276 snowboarding, although that is an objective.
###279 But he's done enough to know that it's about having a good
###283 time out there.
###283 And we went on a camping trip last year.
###286 And there was not really any good snow around.
###289 Guch goes and butters out those cornice and then just
###291 does this Backside 5, and stomps it.
###295 It wasn't like the hugest thing in the world.
###297 But for the conditions that we had, I was blown away.
###301 We had some younger guys in our group.
###303 And I'm like, this guy is like 10 years older than these.
###307 These kids should be up here riding this, and he should be
###309 down here watching.
###310 But no.
###310 He lapped the thing like 20 times and was just taking what
###314 the mountains gave him.
###315 And that inspired me once again.
###317 JAKE PRICE: You going to side flip it?
###318 
###322 BRYAN IGUCHI: I'm just going to go.
###322 JAKE PRICE: OK.
###324 VERNON: You guys ready?
###325 JAKE PRICE: Yep.
###326 VERNON: Ready.
###327 
###335 Well, that's a fun jump, though.
###338 Perfect nice landing.
###339 JAKE PRICE: Heck yeah.
###340 VERNON: You can't even hear him.
###341 JAKE PRICE: He hit the pocket that time.
###342 VERNON: Yeah.
###345 BRYAN IGUCHI: I think I've taken the right path.
###348 And I think my perseverance with
###349 snowboarding is paying off.
###351 It's like I'm still involved as a professional snowboarder.
###354 And it's just changing.
###356 I feel more as an ambassador for the sport.
###359 They want to continue to support me with my
###362 snowboarding, they want to film and shoot photos, I love
###365 to go out and ride.
###366 I'll always be out there.
###368 Camera or not, or regardless of who I'm with, I'm going to
###372 be out snowboarding.
###373 I love it, man.
###375 JAKE PRICE: Yeah, ready.
###376 VERNON: Ready.
###378 
###388 JAKE PRICE: Wow, he's on fire.
###390 VERNON: He wants to keep hitting it.
###391 JAKE PRICE: Yeah, Guch.
###392 
###396 BRYAN IGUCHI: It feels good to be a part of it, and to be
###398 able to offer something and contribute to younger
###402 snowboarders, and the Volcom team, and having the guys want
###407 to come out and ride with me, and be able to help out with
###410 photo shoots, and help get film shots, and help
###413 just make it happen.
###414 I think it feels good to be a part of the team.
###418 We going?
###419 JAKE PRICE: Yeah, dude.
###420 BRYAN IGUCHI: I feel weird.
###421 JAKE PRICE: How come?
###422 BRYAN IGUCHI: Just solo sessioning.
###424 JAKE PRICE: That's awesome.
###425 
###430 BILLY ANDERSON: Guch is just an amazing person.
###432 He's just very humble and thankful, great energy, and
###437 just a lot of mountain know-how.
###440 He is just very aware of what's going on.
###442 And it's dangerous out there, like with avalanches and just
###447 different snow conditions, different environments.
###450 Things are always changing out there, and you need
###451 experience.
###453 
###461 JAKE PRICE: Fuck yeah, Guch.
###463 
###465 Over 40 and doing, was that Backside 7?
###468 VERNON: Backside 7 and [INAUDIBLE]?
###470 JAKE PRICE: It's so sick, man.
###471 
###475 BRYAN IGUCHI: Want to get going?
###476 JAKE PRICE: Yeah, I do.
###477 BRYAN IGUCHI: OK.
###478 
###482 Well, I'm here, I planted my roots.
###485 I met my wife here.
###486 I have my son Milo now.
###488 The community and my friends.
###492 It's just home now.
###494 And I'm still continuing to find new places to ride.
###499 And it's still challenging and fun.
###504 I think it's a lot of mountains, a lot of mountains
###507 to explore, a lot of good riding to be had.
###510 I feel it's every season that I have new objectives or I'm
###515 discovering new things and getting to know it better.
###518 BILLY ANDERSON: The doors that he's opening for younger
###521 riders at earlier stages is just something that would be
###524 such a bummer if he wasn't doing it.
###526 And if you had to do that to get to where he is now, I
###529 don't think he missed out on anything.
###531 TRAVIS RICE: I guess the one thing I would say was, beyond
###534 even any of the zones or avalanche knowledge or any
###540 type of actual thing that he showed me, more than anything
###544 he just lives his life.
###547 And he answers to truth and honesty and respect for
###552 himself and the people around him.
###554 BILLY ANDERSON: When I see kind of how he's grown up
###557 through it and be able to take it from a really heavy skate
###561 influence scene and time and really gone with snowboarding
###565 and transformed into the mountains, I mean he's really
###568 at a legendary status.
###569 The lock down that he has on Jackson Hole,
###571 and just his guiding.
###573 And I think he's just about to revamp this whole thing, which
###577 is his potential and influence that he can have on
###580 snowboarding.
###581 There's a full second or even third coming of Bryan
###583 Iguchi right now.
###586 JAKE PRICE: One man demo.
###587 VERNON: Got back.
###588 Several of those were sick, dude.
###590 BRYAN IGUCHI: Thanks.
###590 JAKE PRICE: That was fucking awesome.
###592 BRYAN IGUCHI: This is a fun, fun little jump.
###595 This is fun, you know.
###598 VERNON: Dude, the Back 7 was so sick.
###600 BRYAN IGUCHI: Oh, thanks, man.
###602 VERNON: Man.
###604 BRYAN IGUCHI: This is my snowboard park, you know.
###607 JAKE PRICE: Yeah, just like the--
###609 BRYAN IGUCHI: Kind of like go to fun session jump.
###611 VERNON: It's sick.
###613 That was great.
###614 BRYAN IGUCHI: That cliff up there is pretty sweet, man.
###617 It reminds me of Mission.
###618 There's a step-down over here, too, that might be in.
###622 Did those guys go to the boundary?
###623 JAKE PRICE: Yep.
###623 BRYAN IGUCHI: Cool.
###624 JAKE PRICE: Should we probably go over and meet them?
###625 VERNON: It that far over, or not?
###627 More or less, or?
###628 BRYAN IGUCHI: Whatever you want.
###629 JAKE PRICE: Can we bring them back and
###630 just have a fun session?
###631 
###634 How did you get-- oh, that's a snowmobiler.
###636 Oh see, that's a 6 slash right there, too.
###638 VERNON: In the pocket?
###638 JAKE PRICE: Yeah.
###640 VERNON: It's beautiful.
###640 I'd love to shoot with him there.
###642 JAKE PRICE: You can get up a little higher and see all the
###644 [INAUDIBLE], too.
###645 VERNON: He's going to be here in the morning, huh?
###648 Before the sledders come?
###649
