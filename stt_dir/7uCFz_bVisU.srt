0:0:10,37 --> 0:0:13,4
Our first day inside the Greek
riots have been ridiculous.


4
0:0:13,4 --> 0:0:15,385
While the locals have considered
it a mild version


5
0:0:15,385 --> 0:0:16,63
of what they're used to.


6
0:0:16,63 --> 0:0:19,16
To me, it felt like civil war.


7
0:0:19,16 --> 0:0:22,2
Old women who pat a teenage
and a kiss on the back as


8
0:0:22,2 --> 0:0:24,55
militarized police threw
rocks at our heads.


9
0:0:24,55 --> 0:0:26,3
Everything seemed backwards.


10
0:0:26,3 --> 0:0:29,32
Today, though, George Papandreou
was taking the EU


11
0:0:29,32 --> 0:0:31,38
austerity bill before
Greek parliament.


12
0:0:31,38 --> 0:0:34,76
It seems certain to past and, as
it did, the blood on Athens


13
0:0:34,76 --> 0:0:37,74
streets seemed certain
to boil.


14
0:0:37,74 --> 0:0:39,9
The feeling was that something
had to change.


15
0:0:39,9 --> 0:0:41,51
The system was broken.


16
0:0:41,51 --> 0:0:43,21
They were paying for the
wasteful corruption of the


17
0:0:43,21 --> 0:0:44,87
establishment and they
refused to be


18
0:0:44,87 --> 0:0:46,55
governed by them anymore.


19
0:0:46,55 --> 0:0:48,29
The rhetoric was exciting.


20
0:0:48,29 --> 0:0:49,59
Very easy to get swept up in.


21
0:0:49,59 --> 0:0:54,64



22
0:0:54,64 --> 0:0:57,15
When we got there, though, the
sun was shining and everyone


23
0:0:57,15 --> 0:1:0,45
seemed pretty chill.

By the mid afternoon we were
wandering aimlessly through


27
0:1:54,71 --> 0:1:58,22
the square when, in a moment,
the mood changed completely.


28
0:1:58,22 --> 0:2:0,85
Anonymous bombs began exploding
as the unified


29
0:2:0,85 --> 0:2:2,3
atmosphere of the day
before evaporated.


30
0:2:2,3 --> 0:2:5,93



31
0:2:5,93 --> 0:2:9,49
Just like the previous day the
Communists, led by PAME, had


32
0:2:9,49 --> 0:2:11,77
been protecting parliament,
refusing to let anyone,


33
0:2:11,77 --> 0:2:14,25
including anarchists,
through their lines.


34
0:2:14,25 --> 0:2:17,1
Eventually, the anarchists
frustration boiled over.


35
0:2:17,1 --> 0:2:19,38
And a massive street battle
between Communists and the


36
0:2:19,38 --> 0:2:20,63
Anarchists began.

40
0:2:37,92 --> 0:2:41,8
It seemed as though the workers
militant front, PAME,


41
0:2:41,8 --> 0:2:42,63
had sided with the police.


42
0:2:42,63 --> 0:2:43,79
You remember PAME?


43
0:2:43,79 --> 0:2:45,18
The nice guys in the van?


44
0:2:45,18 --> 0:2:47,6
Well, they charged us, and the
rest of the crowd, with


45
0:2:47,6 --> 0:2:48,72
massive mallets.


46
0:2:48,72 --> 0:2:50,57
Spreading terror as the police
spread tear gas.

While this was going on,
Parliament finally passed the


55
0:4:47,73 --> 0:4:48,98
austerity bill.


56

Let's face it.


58
0:4:56,0 --> 0:4:57,82
It's confusing being
in a riot.


59
0:4:57,82 --> 0:5:0,4
I saw PAME beating
up protesters and


60
0:5:0,4 --> 0:5:1,14
trying to kill us.


61
0:5:1,14 --> 0:5:3,15
But, frankly, I was
shitting myself.


62
0:5:3,15 --> 0:5:5,35
So maybe I'm not
the best judge.


63
0:5:5,35 --> 0:5:7,69
I saw a country tearing
itself apart.

68
0:6:37,6 --> 0:6:39,97
As the sun set on Thursday, news
began to spread that a


69
0:6:39,97 --> 0:6:41,98
man had been killed.


70
0:6:41,98 --> 0:6:44,11
First people were saying that
he was an anarchist.


71
0:6:44,11 --> 0:6:47,33
Then that he was a Communist
killed by anarchist rocks.


72
0:6:47,33 --> 0:6:50,22
Eventually everyone seemed to
agree that the man had died of


73
0:6:50,22 --> 0:6:51,34
natural causes.


74
0:6:51,34 --> 0:6:54,76
Which I think means that he was
literally scared to death.

predictably passed that day.


78
0:7:18,47 --> 0:7:21,24
But the chaos outside parliament
wasn't ignored.


79
0:7:21,24 --> 0:7:23,94
Days later Papandreou
dramatically announced a


80
0:7:23,94 --> 0:7:25,79
referendum on the bill,
only to change


81
0:7:25,79 --> 0:7:27,85
his mind hours later.


82
0:7:27,85 --> 0:7:30,82
Eventually, the prime minister
would step down, while plans


83
0:7:30,82 --> 0:7:32,83
for a coalition government
were drawn up.


84
0:7:32,83 --> 0:7:34,41
Leaving the country looking
more screwed and


85
0:7:34,41 --> 0:7:36,25
confused than ever.


86
0:7:36,25 --> 0:7:39,15
While we were there the riots
felt like a revolution.


87
0:7:39,15 --> 0:7:40,75
Or a Civil War.


88
0:7:40,75 --> 0:7:43,42
In reality, though, it was just
a taste of the political


89
0:7:43,42 --> 0:7:45,43
and social chaos that would
follow for Greece.
