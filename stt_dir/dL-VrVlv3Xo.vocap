###22 CLAIRE TRIMER: Well, name is Claire Trimer, and I'm a baby
###25 sloth wrangler at a sloth sanctuary in Costa Rica.
###29 Well, we probably have about 135 sloths here, under a roof,
###33 that we're caring for.
###35 There's pretty much sloths everywhere
###36 you look around here.
###38 
###41 I have several roles here.
###43 One of them is to supervise the babies.
###47 I weigh them every morning.
###49 I keep after the health issues.
###52 Whoop.
###53 You went poo yesterday.
###55 
###58 Sometimes their mothers die.
###61 And in that way they're orphaned.
###64 Sometimes if a mother senses that a baby is too weak to
###69 survive, or they actually have some kind of problem that the
###73 mother has sensed, these babies are not strong enough
###76 to cling, and they fall to the ground repeatedly.
###79 
###83 A mother sloth is vulnerable every time she
###86 comes to the ground.
###87 And if she thinks that this sloth is not going to survive,
###91 she's not going to keep coming to the ground and risking her
###94 life over and over again.
###95 
###98 KRISTA TITCHENER: I love sloths, because it's been my
###100 favorite animal for about 10 years.
###102 But I love their sweet little face.
###104 They don't ever want to hurt anybody.
###105 They just want to be happy and be peaceful.
###108 And I just love their sweet smile.
###111 My day as a volunteer involves a lot of hard work.
###114 You know, your payoff for the day is getting to interact
###116 with the sloths and play with the sloths and maybe even hold
###119 this sloth's babies and take them for walks.
###122 CLAIRE TRIMER: This is Alfy.
###124 He's actually a year old.
###126 We don't know why, but Alfy never gained a lot of weight,
###130 and his fur is still the texture of baby fur.
###135 
###149 KRISTA TITCHENER: At 6:00 AM in the morning, we clean out
###150 their cages.
###151 We really get to wake them up, which is a great time for us.
###154 One of our favorites is Delilah, and she will actually
###157 pull the towel back over her head because he doesn't want
###160 to see you in the morning.
###161 She's way too tired.
###162 
###165 Sid is our absolute favorite.
###167 My sister and I decided to adopt Sid.
###170 KIM CATALA: Adopting him does not mean that we
###172 can take him home.
###172 We wish we could.
###174 But we know we can't.
###175 So we just signed a little certificate that we were
###178 adopting Sid.
###179 The money goes to the program.
###181 And then we'll write to him and send him letters and
###183 everything.
###185 He'll like actually grab you under your arms.
###188 Like he likes to be slow-danced.
###190 Should we dance, Sid?
###192 
###200 CLAIRE TRIMER: Occasionally, someone says, how can you tell
###203 them apart?
###204 And I always want to go, how can you not tell them apart?
###208 Yeah, you can tell them apart.
###209 You can tell your children apart, so you can tell the
###211 baby sloths apart.
###212 Yeah.
###213 They're just a huge part of my life.
###214 I'm with them almost every single day.
###217 And they are sort of like my children.
