###8 MALE SPEAKER: Now, does that one come with the photo?
###11 THOM DEVITA: This one is not for sale.
###14 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.
###15 
###19 THOM DEVITA: Isn't that a great photo?
###21 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###22 THOM DEVITA: The black and white one.
###24 No gloves, ink, and blood.
###27 MALE SPEAKER: When did you start wearing gloves?
###30 THOM DEVITA: I kept thinking I should be wearing gloves.
###33 And one day, a girl who was working for Ed came up.
###38 And she looked in my little room--
###40 I had customers outside--
###42 and she looks in, and she says aloud, no gloves?
###46 
###48 I sent Fred out for a box of gloves.
###52 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###64 JOHN WYATT: People would come into the shop with a
###68 preconceived notion.
###69 For example, a lot of the Hispanic men wanted Jesus
###74 Christ or the Madonna.
###77 And Tom felt like tattooing something Japanese.
###81 And he would invariably talk them into, instead of Christ,
###84 a Japanese demon head, or instead of Madonna, a woman
###89 that looked like a hooker.
###93 I met Thom in about '73, '74.
###97 And I went into this apartment around Washington Square Park.
###103 Ed was tattooing a Kirin on the back of Thom's thigh.
###107 And I was just blown away.
###108 I never saw anybody like Thom.
###111 Here's a man with a whole body suit, practically.
###115 And I thought, I'm going to have to photograph this guy.
###118 He's so interesting.
###120 And I said, can I have your phone number?
###123 And he said, yes, it's H-E-V-T--
###126 they were all letters.
###127 He didn't think in terms of numbers.
###132 I felt that Thom was not acting strange.
###135 I felt that's truly who he was, that he
###137 was somewhat primitive.
###140 That he's lived in sort of an isolated way and wasn't part
###145 of the mainstream and didn't care about that.
###147 
###149 One of the entertainment qualities to hanging around
###152 the shop was you never knew what was going to happen.
###155 There was a character that showed up with a peace pipe
###158 claiming to be an American Indian, although I think he
###161 was a Latino.
###163 There were just so many different characters there
###166 that it was like going to a Fellini movie every time you
###169 went there.
###171 ED HARDY: Thom had the weirdest assortment of people
###174 around there.
###174 His crew was just very eccentric like
###177 New York street life.
###178 It's like when you read Burroughs in the stories when
###181 people like Junkie and some of those guys are rolling lushes
###185 in Times Square.
###186 It's just a complete old school, New York underworld.
###192 JOHN WYATT: It was a diversity of customers.
###195 Later on he had Chinese gang members coming to him.
###200 Customers would be coming in and out all day, all the time.
###203 So, I was there.
###205 And they would usually call from a payphone, say they were
###208 in the area.
###209 And then usually if Fred Klausen was there, he would go
###214 down the three flights to answer the door.
###217 Fred Klausen was a friend of Tom's.
###220 And he was there almost all of the time.
###223 He drew a lot of the flash that Tom had.
###226 He was a pretty good artist.
###229 NICK BUBASH: And that allowed Thom the time
###231 to just do the tattooing.
###233 I remember he paid Freddy $30 a day, because he would always
###238 say I'm doing this one for Freddy.
###239 I do one a day for Fred.
###241 ED HARDY: He was just like Tom's right-hand guy and
###244 gopher and did a lot of stuff for him and
###247 drew some of the flash.
###248 He was just around.
###249 I mean, it was like everything in deVita's, it was just
###251 really amorphous.
###253 THOM DEVITA: They always used to say, I was the only
###255 tattooer with a butler.
###259 That was Fred.
###261 NICK BUBASH: He answered the door.
###263 He was very soft-spoken.
###265 THOM DEVITA: And Bink saw his first tattoo on Fred, which
###269 was my tattooing.
###271 It's when he was a little kid.
###272 And that was the first tattoos he ever saw.
###275 NICK BUBASH: Oh, because Binks lived near where Fred lived.
###278 ROBERT RYAN: He grew up in the town I grew up in, Point
###280 Pleasant, in New Jersey.
###282 I might have been 10 years old in the
###284 supermarket with my mother.
###287 And I saw this really dynamic person.
###289 He had this really long beard and tattoos all over his arms.
###293 So, the first tattoos I really saw, the first heavily
###296 tattooed person I saw were deVita tattoos.
###300 And later on, I met Fred.
###302 I got to see the tattoos that blew my mind when I
###305 was 10 years old.
###306 I got to see in person.
###308 So cool, and so strong, and so personal.
###311 NICK BUBASH: I think Binks inherited all of Fred's stuff,
###315 all of his journals.
###316 THOM DEVITA: Oh, yeah.
###317 He used to write journals.
###319 NICK BUBASH: Freddy kept journals, I
###320 guess piles of them.
###321 THOM DEVITA: And then he died.
###322 And he gave them all to Binks before he died.
###327 ROBERT RYAN: Before he passed away, he left me his whole
###331 collection of journals.
###332 So, there's actually hundreds of them, which pretty much
###336 span the course of 1966 to about 1994.
###342 It's just cool to really get-- you know, a guy that I knew
###347 pretty well, to really see where he was at when he was my
###350 age and younger, it's really cool.
###352 And it's weird that we were kind of these kindred spirits.
###357 It's strange.
###357 I go through here.
###358 A lot of these notebooks could have been mine, reading some
###362 of the writings and some of the stuff that he collected.
###365 Here's a good Fred one I could read.
###368 "I look up to no man in adoration as I did before.
###372 Now I know I am as strong or stronger than my past Gods.
###375 I meet them as equals where it makes no difference if I don't
###379 meet them at all.
###380 I have my own contentment to keep me company.
###383 The world opens up in front of me without any effort on my
###387 part."
###390 They're really, really a great insight onto Freddy's
###394 personality, and also the time that Thom and Fred were
###398 hanging out in New York.
###399 I don't think that they were necessarily part of a scene.
###403 But they were kind of the scene.
###406 And the whole Eastern Buddhism thing that was kind of
###412 catching on in New York City at the time, they
###414 were there for that.
###416 You talk to Thom about it, and I don't think he was as into
###420 it as Freddy was.
###421 But I think that it was more Thom was friends with Tyler,
###425 and also his neighbor.
###426 
###429 Tyler was an anarchist that had started his own church
###434 down in the Lower East Side.
###436 He would do tattoos according to the phases of the moon and
###439 certain lunar holidays.
###441 He was definitely a far out character.
###443 ED HARDY: My friend Vale did an interview with him in one
###445 of those "Tattootime's." He has this
###447 whole phalanstery thing.
###449 And it was based on a combination of mainly
###451 esoteric, Tibetan-Buddhism, [INAUDIBLE]
###453 stuff, and astrology.
###455 And he did these insane things.
###458 He was a phenomenal, phenomenal person, really just
###462 out there, really brilliant, a real genius.
###466 NICK BUBASH: When you became a member of the Uranian
###468 Phalanstery, you went downstairs.
###472 Dick took your photograph with a Polaroid.
###475 He wrote your name on it backwards.
###478 In other words, I was Kcin Hsabub.
###481 And then he tacked it on the wall in the phalanstery, which
###485 was an old synagogue.
###487 Talk about bizarre.
###489 This Reverend Dick did this.
###492 This is a mantra.
###494 That's "Om Mani Padme Hum." This is from a gravestone, a
###500 Tibetan gravestone.
###502 Then the rest of these things are deVita's.
###504 All this stuff, all these tribal things he put on in the
###508 early '70s.
###511 THOM DEVITA: I'm the first to do the heavy,
###514 what they call, tribal.
###517 I'm the first to do that.
###519 NICK BUBASH: This thing here he found--
###522 it was a carving on a stone that he found
###524 on the ground somewhere.
###528 And he brought it home.
###529 And he rubbed it with ink and pressed it
###532 on a piece of paper.
###533 And he got this design out of it, this
###535 geometrical design here.
###536 And then he tattooed it on me.
###538 ED HARDY: He did a great thing.
###539 He put on a lot of elbows that was off some kind of thing on
###543 the street.
###543 And it was just like, well, that's a good design.
###547 That's a good design.
###549 It was so important.
###550 That's why in a lot of ways, like I say, when I went in his
###553 place, it the first time it really lit my head up.
###556 Because I got so deep into tattooing.
###558 And it took a long time to break it through, and go, oh,
###561 these other things could be great tattoos, too.
###562 And deVita was like the past master of that stuff.
###565 It was mainly like Zuni things, Rainbird designs and
###570 stuff, like black graphic designs.
###574 Cliff was on that big and really realized how great it
###579 could look.
###580 THOM DEVITA: He was a better salesman than I was.
###584 ROBERT RYAN: But people could argue that you were the first
###586 person to do tribal tattooing in the United States.
###589 THOM DEVITA: Yeah, but if they were to ask me 10, 20 years
###593 ago, I would have said it was Cliff.
###596 ROBERT RYAN: But Cliff would have said it was you.
###598 THOM DEVITA: But Cliff said it was me, and I believe him.
###602 Yeah, that's Pueblo Indian design.
###604 SCOTT HARRISON: Was that on somebody's arm?
###607 THOM DEVITA: What?
###608 SCOTT HARRISON: This design?
###610 THOM DEVITA: Ah, yes.
###611 You looked at my work.
###613 SCOTT HARRISON: A lot, a lot.
###614 THOM DEVITA: It can't be a lot, because I'm not in that
###617 many magazines.
###619 Yes.
###622 SCOTT HARRISON: He was one of the first American tattoo
###625 artists to do large-scale tribal work at all.
###628 It was like him and Cliff Raven were some of the first.
###631 And he was doing those big Rainbird patterns that you can
###634 see in that article.
###636 I'd seen him in the white "Tattootime," the art from the
###639 heart issue.
###640 In the article, Ed made a point of really focusing on
###643 how Thom's shop and his environment that he created
###647 was really an organic part of New York.
###652 The Lower East Side at that time was, obviously, this
###654 super dense, sensory overload, kind of place with graffiti,
###658 and all sorts of people hanging out
###659 with stuff going on.
###661 And how his shop was kind of a nexus for all these social
###665 forces that were in New York and congregated there and met
###668 in this weird somewhat surreal environment that Thom had
###674 created that could contain it and let it flow through.
###677 NICK BUBASH: Absolutely, he was blown away by the fact
###680 that Thom had filtered his own life experience through these
###686 tattoo designs, in a sense, and turned them into a whole
###690 different vision.
###691 He was a visionary.
###692 
###700 But people generally did not come by, I don't think, until
###703 much later.
###704 They didn't start to appreciate what he had done
###707 and what he was doing until much, much later.
###709 I mean, years and years later.
###712 He never traveled much.
###714 Thom stayed put, pretty much.
###716 Occasionally, he would go out to California to visit Ed.
###720 Occasionally, he would go to Hawaii.
###722 I mean, you could count them on three fingers.
###725 But then later on in life, he started going to the
###728 conventions.
###729 Pretty much after he retired from tattooing, that's when he
###733 started going to these places.
###734 Because then he would go and sell his art work is what he
###737 was doing when he wasn't tattooing anymore.
###739 He needed to make an income somehow, and that's how.
###742 And he would do a little bit of tattooing.
###745 But he had gotten married.
###746 And Jenny took a job with IBM.
###749 So, they uprooted everything.
###751 And he figured he would just open up a tattoo shop there.
###754 In fact, he did open up a tattoo shop.
###756 He opened up a shop in Newburgh when he
###758 was 60 years old.
###759 But then nobody knew where the hell he was anymore.
###762 But there was no business to support the shop.
###765 He couldn't do it.
###766 I said, you're opening up a tattoo shop.
###768 You're 60 years old.
###769 He said, yeah, and I'm coming back again when I'm 80.
###772 I remember him saying that.
###775 THOM DEVITA: I'll show these guys some of my new flash.
###778 NICK BUBASH: Yeah, you want to see some of his new stuff?
###781 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I would love to.
###781 THOM DEVITA: My last flash.
###784 This is a rubbing from a tattoo stencil.
###786 
###793 And this is meant to be put on a chest this way.
###797 NICK BUBASH: I love the new black paintings that he's
###800 doing, the black paintings with the colored drawings,
###803 colored rubbings, and stuff like that.
###805 Boy, they're just super, really beautiful stuff.
###810 
###813 THOM DEVITA: That's a beauty.
###814 And All the outline is rubbing and then it's filled in.
###821 NICK BUBASH: He takes the filler out of those notebooks,
###824 like the black piece of paper so you can put a piece of art
###827 on both sides of it.
###828 And he takes that piece of paper out.
###830 It's kind of thin and black.
###831 And that's the thinness he needs to get a good
###834 rubbing off of it.
###836 He wanted me to send all the fillers
###838 out of all my notebooks.
###838 I said I'm not going to do it, forget about it.
###844 THOM DEVITA: I call these the creative rubbings.
###846 MALE SPEAKER: Creative rubbings?
###848 THOM DEVITA: Yeah, from tattoo stencils.
###853 ROBERT RYAN: So, when you first started making rubbings,
###855 Thom, was it from when people would share designs with you?
###860 THOM DEVITA: Yeah.
###862 ROBERT RYAN: Before copy machines or
###864 anything like that?
###865 THOM DEVITA: Right.
###867 SCOTT HARRISON: I was getting rubbings of
###868 all his acetate stencils.
###870 When I was doing that, he saw that, and he did a rubbing.
###875 He added--
###875 I think it was either a Virgin Mary or a Jesus--
###879 he added a Koi.
###880 He just rubbed the Koi right on top.
###882 And that's when the stencil rubbing thing started.
###884 And so then he started doing a lot of that on paper.
###886 And he showed it to Nick and Ed.
###888 And then they were like, oh, wow.
###890 I think Ed said, there it was.
###892 It was in front of our faces all these years.
###894 And he just brought it out, like you could do that.
###897 Make these crazy things with the stencils.
###902 ROBERT RYAN: That's the beauty of Thom deVita is that he
###906 doesn't change.
###907 He's doing what he does.
###908 He's making deVita artwork every day.
###912 And the trends come and go.
###914 And he's still doing what he does.
###915 He's kind of like--
###917 I don't want to offend him, because I know his religious
###921 beliefs-- but he's like the Buddha of tattooing to me.
###925 He's just there doing his thing every day
###927 with it, not affected.
###929 
###936 MALE SPEAKER: You've got a lot of artwork.
###939 THOM DEVITA: Some days I don't do anything.
###943 Some would say it gets out of hand that I work everyday.
###947 I'm always working just so I got 40 years of work behind me
###952 with no outlet.
###954 So, it looks like I just recently done it, because I
###957 keep repeating myself.
###961 The tattooers, they're into prints.
###963 I think prints are the thing.
###969 A lot of people are like that.
###970 They got them fooled with prints.
###974 Not only tattooers, but all the
###977 galleries, they sell prints.
###979 When I do sell a print, if it's a print, I work on top of
###986 it, disregard that the print is there.
###989 It's what I do that's important.
###993 ED HARDY: In terms of the art, I mean, none of us were
###998 selling any art.
###999 None of us were doing--
###1002 we were just all tattooing.
###1003 And, of course, I was totally open to the idea of it,
###1005 because I came out of a fine art background.
###1009 Then when we put that show together in Chicago, that "Eye
###1012 Tattooed America," I thought that would really do it.
###1014 The show got a lot of attention.
###1015 The show traveled.
###1016 NICK BUBASH: And it was a show of primarily tattoo artists
###1023 who are also fine artists.
###1025 So, I don't know how many people were in the show, like
###1028 30 people maybe or something like that.
###1031 It was quite a few people.
###1032 SCOTT HARRISON: It was one of the first big art shows of
###1036 tattoo art.
###1037 At that time, even if you weren't very selective,
###1042 finding tattooers who were going to do some art to be in
###1045 a gallery show would have been difficult.
###1050 NICK BUBASH: Thom had a hell of a show.
###1053 SCOTT HARRISON: And the "Eye Tattooed America" show, I
###1055 mean, it was unbelievable.
###1056 It was this giant wall of [INAUDIBLE].
###1060 I mean, he sent 300 pieces.
###1063 So, he sent his whole shop.
###1065 The shop is this organic part of his
###1068 aesthetic, or his house.
###1069 I mean, what is less like deVita's aesthetic than a
###1072 piece of art floating
###1073 symmetrically in a white space?
###1076 I mean, that's the opposite of what he does.
###1079 So, I mean, obviously, he stole the show.
###1082 ED HARDY: It was a really beautiful show.
###1084 Just his perceptions are so completely unique.
###1088 And that's, all these years, we've been trying to get the
###1090 high art world to recognize him.
###1092 And he's just so out there.
###1094 And if people didn't understand the vocabulary of
###1096 tattooing and the cultural context of tattooing, they
###1099 just didn't know where to place it.
###1101 They didn't know what to do with it.
###1102 I thought deVita would make a big hit there.
###1105 But these art people would come in.
###1106 And they just didn't get deVita's stuff.
###1109 NICK BUBASH: No, you know what?
###1110 I never expect anything.
###1113 I think by that point, I had already learned not to expect
###1116 anything, you know?
###1118 JOHN WYATT: This is one of my favorite pieces by Thom.
###1121 The Koi, the colors in it, the brush strokes, I think, are
###1125 just beautiful.
###1127 But I've shown his work to painter friends,
###1130 and they were astounded.
###1131 They're saying, who is this guy?
###1133 He's a genius.
###1134 Look at these brush strokes.
###1136 Here's a guy that doesn't have an art education and is just
###1141 going by intuition.
###1142 And it's genius.
###1144 He's really under-appreciated.
###1146 He really should be shown in a major gallery.
###1149 THOM DEVITA: Did I show you these yet, these landscapes?
###1153 NICK BUBASH: These little vignettes.
###1154 THOM DEVITA: Do you want to see 100 of them?
###1157 MALE SPEAKER: Sure.
###1159 THOM DEVITA: Come here.
###1161 NICK BUBASH: Wow, look at them.
###1163 It's beautiful.
###1164 
###1172 Can you imagine how beautiful these would be if they were
###1174 all lined up, like all in one--
###1178 THOM DEVITA: Yeah, going down the slope of the--
###1181 NICK BUBASH: Of the Guggenheim.
###1183 Yeah, down the Guggenheim.
###1185 One right after another.
###1187 No, I don't think he fits in.
###1189 And I think that's probably why he should be recognized.
###1194 JOHN WYATT: I don't know what label anybody could put on it.
###1198 But it's very different than what I've ever seen before.
###1202 THOM DEVITA: This is one of my boxes.
###1204 The box is a fruit box from the supermarket.
###1209 Oh, I had this in the library art show.
###1215 SCOTT HARRISON: In Newburgh?
###1216 THOM DEVITA: In Newburgh.
###1218 I've been showing there for about 10 years.
###1221 And I've won about three or four ribbons.
###1224 JOHN WYATT: We all want to see him somewhere that he gets the
###1229 fame that we feel he deserves, and the recognition, and the
###1232 appreciation.
###1233 But I think he might be content the way it is.
###1238 SCOTT HARRISON: First of all, he's 80 years old.
###1241 How much do you want an 80-year-old man to work and
###1243 hustle and try and start at the bottom of the art game?
###1247 I mean, that's absurd.
###1249 He does it because that's what he does.
###1252 He is a true artist.
###1253 He makes it if no one looks at it.
###1256 We didn't get to the full resume of his art shows.
###1259 Because some of the art shows that he participates
###1261 in have been at--
###1263 I think it was called the Newburgh Arts Festival, where
###1264 they have the amateur art shows.
###1268 And he would go.
###1269 And he would set up his little table.
###1271 And he would have exactly what you see in his house, or
###1276 whatever, these super interesting,
###1278 rough montage things.
###1280 And he would just sit there with the old lady who did the
###1283 color-by-numbers painting and whatever.
###1284 He would just sit there.
###1287 THOM DEVITA: The show's started already.
###1289 I wanted to count how many people come in.
###1291 So, we had to go, and they still come in.
###1294 FEMALE SPEAKER: This is so cool.
###1298 So, you're ready?
###1299 THOM DEVITA: Yes.
###1300 FEMALE SPEAKER: To give your spiel?
###1301 THOM DEVITA: What spiel?
###1302 FEMALE SPEAKER: The history of Thom.
###1304 THOM DEVITA: To who?
###1306 FEMALE SPEAKER: To everybody.
###1307 
###1315 So, this is you here doing this?
###1317 THOM DEVITA: Yeah.
###1319 CAROLINE: What is your name?
###1320 THOM DEVITA: deVita.
###1321 CAROLINE: Steve, mine's Caroline.
###1323 And you live in Newburgh?
###1324 THOM DEVITA: Yes, my name is deVita.
###1326 MALE SPEAKER: deVita.
###1327 CAROLINE: deVita.
###1328 OK, what's your first name?
###1329 THOM DEVITA: Thom.
###1329 CAROLINE: Thom deVita.
###1331 MALE SPEAKER: I think people have been waiting for you to
###1333 come down from the hill.
###1335 SCOTT HARRISON: I've been trying to get people to
###1337 appreciate Thom for so long.
###1339 And now it's like when those tattooers came in yesterday
###1342 and were like, oh, just wanted you to know we
###1344 really respect you.
###1345 It just touched me.
###1346 And it was also like, where the fuck have you guys been?
###1349 MALE TATTOOER: How you doing, Mr. deVita?
###1351 It's an honor to meet you.
###1352 THOM DEVITA: Thanks.
###1353 MALE TATTOOER: Yeah, definitely.
###1354 I've been wanting to come and visit you for awhile.
###1357 So, it's pretty exciting.
###1358 THOM DEVITA: Where's your shop in [INAUDIBLE]
###1360 Falls?
###1361 MALE TATTOOER: Right on Main Street.
###1362 It's called Graceland Tattoo.
###1363 THOM DEVITA: Yeah, we pass by there sometimes.
###1366 See, if I was walking, I would walk by a tattoo shop.
###1370 Because I usually don't go into them.
###1373 Because nobody knows who I am.
###1374 MALE TATTOOER: We do.
###1376 THOM DEVITA: I doubt it.
###1377 If I had walked in, you would have known who I was?
###1381 MALE TATTOOER: Oh, I would have.
###1382 FEMALE SPEAKER: He would know.
###1383 MALE TATTOOER: Well, I guess you'd be surprised at how many
###1386 of us know you and look up to you.
###1389 I know I do.
###1391 SCOTT HARRISON: I just want Thom to be happy.
###1394 And I don't think that--
###1396 I mean, I'm sure he'd be happy to have a museum show.
###1399 But he's a very grounded guy.
###1401 It would just be another event in his week if he had a museum
###1405 show, I think.
###1406 I would like for people to keep his mind entertained a
###1411 little bit.
###1411 THOM DEVITA: Six months later they'd come back and
###1414 want to cover me.
###1417 SCOTT HARRISON: I would like to see Thom engaged in the
###1422 tattoo world as much as he would like to be and have
###1424 people who respect him to talk to him and just give him some
###1432 kind of integration into the world.
###1434 
###1437 THOM DEVITA: Here you go.
###1438 FEMALE SPEAKER: Beautiful.
###1440 I love it.
###1443 Thank you.
###1445 THOM DEVITA: All right, thank you.
###1448 FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.
###1451 THOM DEVITA: This is taking longer than I thought.
###1453 SCOTT HARRISON: Because your method is very slow, Thom.
###1455 THOM DEVITA: I thought it would be one hour.
###1459 I'm tired.
###1459 SCOTT HARRISON: You're tired, it hasn't started yet.
###1462 THOM DEVITA: Put ghost cat.
###1463 SCOTT HARRISON: You got nine hours.
###1464 THOM DEVITA: Here.
###1465 SCOTT HARRISON: This one?
###1466 
###1469 Where are we going?
###1470 THOM DEVITA: Why you got to keep asking me?
###1471 Just put them up.
###1473 SCOTT HARRISON: Because as soon as I do it under my own
###1476 direction, you're going to make me take it
###1479 down and move it.
###1480 THOM DEVITA: He don't want to make any decisions.
###1484 MALE SPEAKER: I think he knows the consequences.
###1486 SCOTT HARRISON: I'm not getting
###1487 paid managerial salary.
###1489 I'm just a day laborer.
