1
0:0:1,568 --> 0:0:5,472
The Vikings were some of the
fiercest warriors of all time,


2
0:0:5,472 --> 0:0:9,309
and a select few carried
the ultimate weapon:


3
0:0:9,309 --> 0:0:12,679
a sword nearly a thousand years
ahead of its time,


4
0:0:12,679 --> 0:0:15,515
built by a mysterious craftsman


5
0:0:15,515 --> 0:0:19,786
from a material unknown
to rivals for centuries.


6
0:0:19,786 --> 0:0:24,758
The sword was known
as the "Ulfberht."


7
0:0:24,758 --> 0:0:28,828
ALAN WILLIAMS:
The swords were far better than any other swords made


8
0:0:28,828 --> 0:0:30,597
before or since in Europe.


9
0:0:30,597 --> 0:0:34,567
NARRATOR:
The secrets behind its design, creation and use


10
0:0:34,567 --> 0:0:36,936
have been lost.


11
0:0:36,936 --> 0:0:40,106
But now the world's largest
steel company


12
0:0:40,106 --> 0:0:44,477
and a modern-day blacksmith
divine its mysteries


13
0:0:44,477 --> 0:0:47,847
and bring the Ulfberht
back to life.


14
0:0:47,847 --> 0:0:49,482
RIC FURRER:
To do it right,


15
0:0:49,482 --> 0:0:52,185
it is the most complicated thing
I know how to make,


16
0:0:52,185 --> 0:0:56,89
and it's that challenge
that drives me.


17
0:0:56,89 --> 0:1:0,226
NARRATOR:
A millennium after its time of glory,


18
0:1:0,226 --> 0:1:2,929

23
0:1:52,11 --> 0:1:54,581
and by PBS viewers like you.


24
0:1:54,581 --> 0:1:56,749
Additional funding from:


25
0:1:56,749 --> 0:2:29,616
Inspiring tomorrow's engineers
and technologists.


26
0:2:29,616 --> 0:2:31,684
NARRATOR:
Master swordsman John Clements


27
0:2:31,684 --> 0:2:38,491
has cut with some of the most
famous swords ever made...


28
0:2:38,491 --> 0:2:41,94
...from Damascus steel blades


29
0:2:41,94 --> 0:2:51,437
to the legendary samurai sword,
the Katana.


30
0:2:51,437 --> 0:2:55,942
Forged by master craftsmen
from the 14th century onward,


31
0:2:55,942 --> 0:3:0,446
the samurai sword is renowned
for its elegantly curved blade


32
0:3:0,446 --> 0:3:3,249
and impressive cutting ability.


33
0:3:3,249 --> 0:3:4,684
I think the Katana
is a beautiful weapon,


34
0:3:4,684 --> 0:3:5,885
it's a fine weapon.


35
0:3:5,885 --> 0:3:9,189
It slices, it cuts,
it thrusts, it dices,


36
0:3:9,189 --> 0:3:14,961
it makes julienne fries,
it's wonderful.


37
0:3:14,961 --> 0:3:17,33
But it has been exaggerated.


38
0:3:17,33 --> 0:3:23,69
NARRATOR:
Exaggerated because sharpness alone is not enough.


39
0:3:23,69 --> 0:3:25,638
So you see demonstrations
of a sharp sword like this


40
0:3:25,638 --> 0:3:27,874
cutting material all the time
and you think it's impressive


41
0:3:27,874 --> 0:3:30,43
because, "Ooh,
look what it does!"


42
0:3:30,43 --> 0:3:34,8
But that's really not that
impressive, and here's why.


43
0:3:34,8 --> 0:3:38,151
This is a wide medieval bastard
sword, and this one's blunt.


44
0:3:38,151 --> 0:3:40,62
It's got no real edge to it.


45
0:3:40,62 --> 0:3:42,455
No edge sharpness.


46
0:3:42,455 --> 0:3:48,861
But watch what I'm going
to do with it.


47
0:3:48,861 --> 0:3:50,997
A really good sword
is not just about cutting


48
0:3:50,997 --> 0:3:55,134
with a really sharp edge.


49
0:3:55,134 --> 0:3:59,839
NARRATOR:
Strength, flexibility, weight and shape all determine


50
0:3:59,839 --> 0:4:3,142
how well a blade meets the
combat challenges of its time


51
0:4:3,142 --> 0:4:6,813
and whether it's
a superior sword.


52
0:4:6,813 --> 0:4:10,216
Many great swords are famous,


53
0:4:10,216 --> 0:4:12,418
but there's one
few have ever heard of


54
0:4:12,418 --> 0:4:17,924
that was perfectly designed
for its day.


55
0:4:17,924 --> 0:4:20,226
They were a luxury:
rare and expensive.


56
0:4:20,226 --> 0:4:22,362
It was the Rolls Royce
of the swords.


57
0:4:22,362 --> 0:4:26,532
NARRATOR:
Produced only from about 800 to 1,000 A.D.,


58
0:4:26,532 --> 0:4:30,37
this Viking sword was made
from a pure steel


59
0:4:30,37 --> 0:4:33,806
not seen again in Europe
for nearly a thousand years.


60
0:4:33,806 --> 0:4:36,776
This high-tech weapon
of its time


61
0:4:36,776 --> 0:4:44,951
was inscribed with the
mysterious word "Ulfberht."


62
0:4:44,951 --> 0:4:47,287
Carried by only
a few elite warriors,


63
0:4:47,287 --> 0:4:49,956
the Ulfberht represented
the perfect marriage


64
0:4:49,956 --> 0:5:4,103
of form and function in the
chaos that was a Viking battle.


65
0:5:4,103 --> 0:5:8,7
NIELS LYNNERUP:
It's not people divide you up and have a nice duel one-to-one.


66
0:5:8,7 --> 0:5:9,709
The fight was very violent.


67
0:5:9,709 --> 0:5:11,377
Chaos.


68
0:5:11,377 --> 0:5:13,546
People moving around,


69
0:5:13,546 --> 0:5:15,615
striking out whenever possible.


70
0:5:15,615 --> 0:5:18,84
Some people were struck
multiple times


71
0:5:18,84 --> 0:5:22,522
and from all kinds of angles.


72
0:5:22,522 --> 0:5:25,291
NARRATOR:
The Vikings spread out from Scandinavia,


73
0:5:25,291 --> 0:5:27,66
colonizing vast expanses
of Europe


74
0:5:27,66 --> 0:5:30,797
from the eighth
through 11th centuries.


75
0:5:30,797 --> 0:5:32,999
They are so admired as fighters


76
0:5:32,999 --> 0:5:42,775
that people to this day
re-enact their battles.


77
0:5:42,775 --> 0:5:46,479
In Viking times, most men
fought with axes and spears.


78
0:5:46,479 --> 0:5:50,717
But those who could afford it
used swords for close combat.


79
0:5:50,717 --> 0:5:53,353
The Ulfberht's combination


80
0:5:53,353 --> 0:5:57,79
of strength, lightness and
flexibility was an advantage.


81
0:5:57,79 --> 0:6:0,727
WILLIAMS:
The swords were far better than any other swords made


82
0:6:0,727 --> 0:6:3,83
before or since in Europe.


83
0:6:3,83 --> 0:6:6,766
And these must have been
extraordinarily valuable


84
0:6:6,766 --> 0:6:12,672
to their contemporaries
because of their properties.


85
0:6:12,672 --> 0:6:15,208
NARRATOR:
Thousands of Viking swords have been found,


86
0:6:15,208 --> 0:6:19,178
most discovered in rivers
or excavated from Viking burials


87
0:6:19,178 --> 0:6:22,248
across Scandinavia
and Northern Europe.


88
0:6:22,248 --> 0:6:26,886
But only 171 have been
identified as Ulfberhts.


89
0:6:26,886 --> 0:6:29,255
JON ANDERS RISVAAG:
The swords as they are today,


90
0:6:29,255 --> 0:6:32,558
it's very hard to see
that this was actually


91
0:6:32,558 --> 0:6:35,128
a state-of-the-art weapon.


92
0:6:35,128 --> 0:6:37,263
NARRATOR:
Buried for centuries,


93
0:6:37,263 --> 0:6:42,168
only corroded skeletons of
the once glorious blades remain.


94
0:6:42,168 --> 0:6:46,606
RISVAAG:
They don't look very much today, but in their time


95
0:6:46,606 --> 0:6:50,41
the Ulfberht was the weapon
of the upper strata.


96
0:6:50,41 --> 0:6:54,614
You would certainly
notice a person


97
0:6:54,614 --> 0:6:56,549
carrying a weapon like this.


98
0:6:56,549 --> 0:6:59,986
This would be a very precious,
very beautiful object,


99
0:6:59,986 --> 0:7:2,655
and a deadly one too, obviously.


100
0:7:2,655 --> 0:7:6,459
NARRATOR:
The secret of the Ulfberht's construction


101
0:7:6,459 --> 0:7:9,796
has been lost
for nearly a thousand years.


102
0:7:9,796 --> 0:7:14,333
But can a modern-day blacksmith
recapture that technology


103
0:7:14,333 --> 0:7:17,77
and bring this remarkable sword
back to life?


104
0:7:17,77 --> 0:7:19,338
FURRER:
To do it right,


105
0:7:19,338 --> 0:7:23,209
it is the most complicated thing
I know how to make


106
0:7:23,209 --> 0:7:26,379
and it's that challenge
that drives me.


107
0:7:26,379 --> 0:7:33,352
I don't need a sword,
but I have to make them.


108
0:7:33,352 --> 0:7:35,822
Not because I can't do
anything else,


109
0:7:35,822 --> 0:7:38,791
but because <i>I can't do</i>
<i>anything else.</i>


110
0:7:38,791 --> 0:7:41,727
NARRATOR:
In northern Wisconsin,


111
0:7:41,727 --> 0:7:45,865
Ric Furrer is starting out
on the task of a lifetime.


112
0:7:45,865 --> 0:7:49,402
He's one of the few people
on the planet who has the skills


113
0:7:49,402 --> 0:7:53,473
to unravel the mystery
of how the Ulfberht was made.


114
0:7:53,473 --> 0:7:55,908
FURRER:
I'm drawing a full-scale paper model


115
0:7:55,908 --> 0:8:0,546
of the sword blade that I'm
going to try to recreate.


116
0:8:0,546 --> 0:8:3,316
This Ulfberht inlaid sword
was popular


117
0:8:3,316 --> 0:8:5,117
about a thousand years ago


118
0:8:5,117 --> 0:8:7,153
and nobody has made a recreation


119
0:8:7,153 --> 0:8:14,126
metallurgically accurate
since then.


120
0:8:14,126 --> 0:8:18,598
I hope to figure out
if I can recreate accurately


121
0:8:18,598 --> 0:8:21,767
how these blades
would have been made back then.


122
0:8:21,767 --> 0:8:24,237
NARRATOR:
There are mysteries about everything


123
0:8:24,237 --> 0:8:28,241
related to the making
of the Ulfberht.


124
0:8:28,241 --> 0:8:30,443
FURRER:
These were, to a large extent, secrets.


125
0:8:30,443 --> 0:8:33,646
You didn't want to give away


126
0:8:33,646 --> 0:8:35,982
your manufacturing technology
for your weaponry


127
0:8:35,982 --> 0:8:37,316
to anybody else.


128
0:8:37,316 --> 0:8:39,886
So we have to look
at the artifact


129
0:8:39,886 --> 0:8:43,289
and then reverse-engineer.


130
0:8:43,289 --> 0:8:48,561
Sometimes it's a matter of
removing 1/32 of an inch here


131
0:8:48,561 --> 0:8:51,497
or adding it there or...


132
0:8:51,497 --> 0:8:54,433
subtleties that
you don't think matter


133
0:8:54,433 --> 0:8:56,769
that can in fact
make a huge difference


134
0:8:56,769 --> 0:9:2,441
in how the blade performs.


135
0:9:2,441 --> 0:9:4,76
The trick is to piece together


136
0:9:4,76 --> 0:9:8,414
from enough archaeological
evidence to figure out


137
0:9:8,414 --> 0:9:11,517
what the proportions
of these blades should be


138
0:9:11,517 --> 0:9:13,319
and then the chemistry.


139
0:9:13,319 --> 0:9:16,756
What is the material
that these were made out of?


140
0:9:16,756 --> 0:9:18,824
And that is new information,


141
0:9:18,824 --> 0:9:29,869
why they're metallurgically
different.


142
0:9:29,869 --> 0:9:32,38
NARRATOR:
In London, one of the world's leading experts


143
0:9:32,38 --> 0:9:34,941
on historic steel weaponry,
Alan Williams,


144
0:9:34,941 --> 0:9:37,61
recently made a discovery
about the Ulfberht


145
0:9:37,61 --> 0:9:41,581
that shocked scientists
and sword makers alike.


146
0:9:41,581 --> 0:9:43,783
WILLIAMS:
I've been fascinated by armor and swords


147
0:9:43,783 --> 0:9:45,918
for a very long time


148
0:9:45,918 --> 0:9:47,987
and have always wanted
to find out


149
0:9:47,987 --> 0:9:50,356
what they were made of
and how they were made.


150
0:9:50,356 --> 0:9:55,595
Smelted iron was the source
for swords, weapons, armor


151
0:9:55,595 --> 0:9:58,23
for thousands of years.


152
0:9:58,23 --> 0:10:2,68
NARRATOR:
From about 800 B.C. till today,


153
0:10:2,68 --> 0:10:4,904
humans have made weapons
from steel.


154
0:10:4,904 --> 0:10:7,707
The process starts with iron,


155
0:10:7,707 --> 0:10:10,42
which is found
in the ground as ore.


156
0:10:10,42 --> 0:10:15,47
The crushed ore is heated to
separate the iron from the rock.


157
0:10:15,47 --> 0:10:20,92
But on its own, iron is too soft
to yield a strong weapon.


158
0:10:20,92 --> 0:10:27,46
The trick is to add carbon, most
commonly from coal or charcoal.


159
0:10:27,46 --> 0:10:31,964
This hardens the metal
and turns it into steel.


160
0:10:31,964 --> 0:10:35,735
But not all steels
are created equal.


161
0:10:35,735 --> 0:10:40,72
First, Williams examines
a sample encased in acrylic


162
0:10:40,72 --> 0:10:43,476
from a typical Viking Age sword.


163
0:10:43,476 --> 0:10:45,778
Not only does it have
low carbon,


164
0:10:45,778 --> 0:10:48,948
it has impurities, known as
slag, that weaken it further.


165
0:10:48,948 --> 0:10:51,851
WILLIAMS:
Medieval iron is both soft and brittle.


166
0:10:51,851 --> 0:10:56,989
This is a sample of a sword
of modest quality.


167
0:10:56,989 --> 0:11:1,661
These long inclusions, perhaps
looking a bit like sausages,


168
0:11:1,661 --> 0:11:6,65
these are inclusions of slag,
the non-metallic part of the ore


169
0:11:6,65 --> 0:11:9,368
which has never been separated
from the iron.


170
0:11:9,368 --> 0:11:13,305
The slag makes the iron brittle,


171
0:11:13,305 --> 0:11:16,542
which doesn't actually give you
a terribly good sword.


172
0:11:16,542 --> 0:11:21,914
NARRATOR:
Medieval blacksmiths in Europe didn't make slag-free steel


173
0:11:21,914 --> 0:11:24,25
because their fires
weren't hot enough


174
0:11:24,25 --> 0:11:27,319
to fully liquefy the iron.


175
0:11:27,319 --> 0:11:30,456
In modern times,
metals are melted


176
0:11:30,456 --> 0:11:33,259
at temperatures
over 3,000 degrees.


177
0:11:33,259 --> 0:11:35,461
This separates out the slag


178
0:11:35,461 --> 0:11:40,332
and allows more carbon
to be mixed in evenly.


179
0:11:40,332 --> 0:11:42,68
But in the Viking era,


180
0:11:42,68 --> 0:11:45,104
carbon could only be introduced
incidentally,


181
0:11:45,104 --> 0:11:48,74
mainly through the coal
in the fire,


182
0:11:48,74 --> 0:11:51,31
and the only way to remove
the slag from the metal


183
0:11:51,31 --> 0:11:58,35
was to try to hammer out
the impurities with each strike.


184
0:11:58,35 --> 0:12:0,553
Of the thousands
of European swords


185
0:12:0,553 --> 0:12:2,655
from the Middle Ages
that have been found,


186
0:12:2,655 --> 0:12:7,56
all were thought to have been
made from this inferior steel


187
0:12:7,56 --> 0:12:10,73
until Williams analyzed
the Ulfberht.


188
0:12:10,73 --> 0:12:13,799
WILLIAMS:
One or two swords I looked at seemed to be different.


189
0:12:13,799 --> 0:12:15,434
They were made of steel


190
0:12:15,434 --> 0:12:19,105
which I'd never seen before
or since in a medieval object.


191
0:12:19,105 --> 0:12:22,608
This seems to be a completely
different material.


192
0:12:22,608 --> 0:12:25,911
The first thing
that strikes you is that


193
0:12:25,911 --> 0:12:28,514
there are none of these long,
grey slag inclusions


194
0:12:28,514 --> 0:12:30,649
which make the metal brittle.


195
0:12:30,649 --> 0:12:34,52
The uniformity is more like
a modern steel


196
0:12:34,52 --> 0:12:37,323
than it is a medieval one.


197
0:12:37,323 --> 0:12:41,527
And it has got a carbon content
of about three times as much


198
0:12:41,527 --> 0:12:44,563
as the medieval steel
we looked at a moment ago.


199
0:12:44,563 --> 0:12:46,932
I thought it was very odd.


200
0:12:46,932 --> 0:12:50,569
I couldn't think
of a reason for it.


201
0:12:50,569 --> 0:12:53,205
NARRATOR:
The only swords Williams found


202
0:12:53,205 --> 0:12:56,75
that were made of this clean,
high-carbon steel


203
0:12:56,75 --> 0:12:59,779
were those marked as Ulfberht.


204
0:12:59,779 --> 0:13:3,516
The metal,
known as crucible steel,


205
0:13:3,516 --> 0:13:7,82
gave the swords capabilities
far ahead of their time.


206
0:13:7,82 --> 0:13:9,755
But it could only be made


207
0:13:9,755 --> 0:13:12,291
by melting iron
at high temperatures,


208
0:13:12,291 --> 0:13:16,462
and no one in Europe would know
how to do this for centuries.


209
0:13:16,462 --> 0:13:20,32
WILLIAMS:
The material used was a novel material


210
0:13:20,32 --> 0:13:23,35
not found anywhere else
in Europe in the Middle Ages.


211
0:13:23,35 --> 0:13:29,542
FURRER:
The biggest mystery is where did they get this raw material?


212
0:13:29,542 --> 0:13:32,244
We have no archaeological
evidence


213
0:13:32,244 --> 0:13:37,349
of any crucible steel production
in Europe until 800 years later.


214
0:13:37,349 --> 0:13:40,52
NARRATOR:
So how did these Norsemen,


215
0:13:40,52 --> 0:13:43,856
widely viewed to this day
as barbarians,


216
0:13:43,856 --> 0:13:47,426
get this cutting-edge
technology?


217
0:13:47,426 --> 0:13:49,962
Contrary to their image,


218
0:13:49,962 --> 0:13:52,631
the Vikings were advanced
in many ways.


219
0:13:52,631 --> 0:13:57,269
They were highly skilled
navigators and traders,


220
0:13:57,269 --> 0:13:59,438
who are believed to have
extended their reach


221
0:13:59,438 --> 0:14:5,611
as far as North America
and Central Asia.


222
0:14:5,611 --> 0:14:7,813
LJUNGQVIST:
During the Viking Age in Scandinavia,


223
0:14:7,813 --> 0:14:11,817
all free men were by law


224
0:14:11,817 --> 0:14:14,954
forced to possess weapons
and go to war.


225
0:14:14,954 --> 0:14:20,292
But much Viking warfare
was raiding and plunder.


226
0:14:20,292 --> 0:14:24,29
NARRATOR:
Many Vikings were pagans who worshipped their weapons


227
0:14:24,29 --> 0:14:28,167
and even believed a sword could
help a warrior enter heaven.


228
0:14:28,167 --> 0:14:30,736
LJUNGQVIST:
The warriors would come to a special place called Valhalla,


229
0:14:30,736 --> 0:14:36,642
where they would have feasts and
fighting in a warrior paradise.


230
0:14:36,642 --> 0:14:39,979
The only way to get to Valhalla
was to be a warrior


231
0:14:39,979 --> 0:14:47,519
and die in battle
with your sword in your hand.


232
0:14:47,519 --> 0:14:52,157
GUNNAR ANDERSSON:
The sagas tell stories about the swords, how powerful they were.


233
0:14:52,157 --> 0:14:55,928
Many of the swords
had personal names,


234
0:14:55,928 --> 0:15:4,37
sometimes that are connected to,
for instance, a bear or a wolf.


235
0:15:4,37 --> 0:15:6,538
By giving it a name,


236
0:15:6,538 --> 0:15:10,276
you could also incorporate
the power of your ancestor


237
0:15:10,276 --> 0:15:22,955
or somebody very strong
into the sword.


238
0:15:22,955 --> 0:15:24,79
CLEMENTS:
See how your whole weapon's blocked


239
0:15:24,79 --> 0:15:27,359
and there's that sweet
opening right there?


240
0:15:27,359 --> 0:15:29,61
So you throw that blow,


241
0:15:29,61 --> 0:15:33,832
my point's right between both
your weapon and your shield.


242
0:15:33,832 --> 0:15:36,735
NARRATOR:
According to John Clements, in the arms race of the day,


243
0:15:36,735 --> 0:15:39,939
blades rarely touched
each other directly.


244
0:15:39,939 --> 0:15:44,76
Instead, they pounded against
armor and shields


245
0:15:44,76 --> 0:15:49,415
as fighters tried
to go for the kill.


246
0:15:49,415 --> 0:15:53,118
CLEMENTS:
The reality of Viking combat is


247
0:15:53,118 --> 0:15:59,58
there's not the constant edge-
on-edge, blade-on-blade contact.


248
0:15:59,58 --> 0:16:0,759
Yeah, very good.


249
0:16:0,759 --> 0:16:3,429
They're using the shields
far more dynamically,


250
0:16:3,429 --> 0:16:5,23
they're getting in close,


251
0:16:5,23 --> 0:16:9,101
they're overwhelming their
opponent with vicious blows.


252
0:16:9,101 --> 0:16:11,57
I come in,
I hit your shield.


253
0:16:11,57 --> 0:16:14,84
If I don't do it right,
you're going to get me.


254
0:16:14,84 --> 0:16:17,309
But if you do,
there is that opening,


255
0:16:17,309 --> 0:16:19,945
because you can't raise
your shield.


256
0:16:19,945 --> 0:16:22,214
We've got to think
of the sword as a tool


257
0:16:22,214 --> 0:16:25,918
that's being used to do things
such as warding off blows.


258
0:16:25,918 --> 0:16:29,822
It has to be robust
and resilient


259
0:16:29,822 --> 0:16:33,192
because fighting is not just
about clash, clash, clash.


260
0:16:33,192 --> 0:16:38,23
It's a lot more dynamic.


261
0:16:38,23 --> 0:16:40,566
NARRATOR:
The lack of brittle impurities in the steel


262
0:16:40,566 --> 0:16:43,736
made the Ulfberht
unusually flexible,


263
0:16:43,736 --> 0:16:46,939
and this was a huge advantage.


264
0:16:46,939 --> 0:16:48,774
A Viking fighter was doomed


265
0:16:48,774 --> 0:16:51,41
if his sword got stuck
in a shield and broke.


266
0:16:51,41 --> 0:16:57,616
It took a special steel
to withstand such stress,


267
0:16:57,616 --> 0:17:0,619
and a sword that could do this


268
0:17:0,619 --> 0:17:8,327
might even have been seen
to possess magical powers.


269
0:17:8,327 --> 0:17:10,362
FURRER:
These blades and these blacksmiths


270
0:17:10,362 --> 0:17:15,234
were held in certain esteem
and also feared a little


271
0:17:15,234 --> 0:17:18,937
because of this elemental
property of what they're working


272
0:17:18,937 --> 0:17:21,54
and what they're producing.


273
0:17:21,54 --> 0:17:25,411
To be able to make a weapon from
dirt is a pretty powerful thing.


274
0:17:25,411 --> 0:17:27,88
NARRATOR:
Magic and science


275
0:17:27,88 --> 0:17:30,783
have been intertwined
throughout human history,


276
0:17:30,783 --> 0:17:33,919
and the Ulfberht merged
the mysticism of the past


277
0:17:33,919 --> 0:17:38,891
with the precision
of the modern world to come.


278
0:17:38,891 --> 0:17:43,529
So this is
our steel-to-be.


279
0:17:43,529 --> 0:17:45,998
NARRATOR:
Starting with raw iron,


280
0:17:45,998 --> 0:17:50,269
Ric begins the process
of making crucible steel.


281
0:17:50,269 --> 0:17:53,872
It's the first of many steps
on the way to a finished sword.


282
0:17:53,872 --> 0:17:59,778
A mistake at any point
could lead to failure.


283
0:17:59,778 --> 0:18:2,281
This charcoal will be
the carbon source for the steel,


284
0:18:2,281 --> 0:18:5,35
so the charcoal here will get
absorbed into the steel.


285
0:18:5,35 --> 0:18:9,655
And we don't need much.


286
0:18:9,655 --> 0:18:12,524
NARRATOR:
If all goes well, carbon from the charcoal


287
0:18:12,524 --> 0:18:15,427
will harden the raw iron
into steel.


288
0:18:15,427 --> 0:18:18,697
This is sand,


289
0:18:18,697 --> 0:18:21,834
and this is
our bottle glass.


290
0:18:21,834 --> 0:18:24,77
They will melt,
chemically bond


291
0:18:24,77 --> 0:18:28,44
with the waste material,
the other slags,


292
0:18:28,44 --> 0:18:31,71
and will help float them away
and leave clean metal


293
0:18:31,71 --> 0:18:35,747
so the carbon can be absorbed.


294
0:18:35,747 --> 0:18:38,417
NARRATOR:
As part of their mystical practices,


295
0:18:38,417 --> 0:18:42,821
some medieval smiths might have
used a different carbon source


296
0:18:42,821 --> 0:18:44,923
to strengthen their swords.


297
0:18:44,923 --> 0:18:47,392
ANDERSSON:
You can also use bone,


298
0:18:47,392 --> 0:18:52,931
burnt bone, together with coal
in hardening the steel right.


299
0:18:52,931 --> 0:18:56,535
And assume now that
you're using burnt bones,


300
0:18:56,535 --> 0:19:2,74
even from your ancestor, or from
a bear or something like that,


301
0:19:2,74 --> 0:19:6,979
and you hammer in the power
of the animal or your ancestor


302
0:19:6,979 --> 0:19:10,249
into the weapon in itself
together with charcoal


303
0:19:10,249 --> 0:19:12,651
and you make a perfect
steel blade--


304
0:19:12,651 --> 0:19:14,987
a very powerful steel blade
probably as well.


305
0:19:14,987 --> 0:19:19,391
FURRER:
We are putting the top onto the crucible.


306
0:19:19,391 --> 0:19:22,361
This clay will completely
seal this crucible


307
0:19:22,361 --> 0:19:24,96
from the furnace environment.


308
0:19:24,96 --> 0:19:27,866
Mostly it's to keep more
charcoal from getting in.


309
0:19:27,866 --> 0:19:30,903
So we want a set amount
of carbon.


310
0:19:30,903 --> 0:19:33,539
And if the charcoal were to
enter, we would have too much.


311
0:19:33,539 --> 0:19:35,374
And there it is.


312
0:19:35,374 --> 0:19:40,612
NARRATOR:
Ric will try to melt the metal in an oven he's building.


313
0:19:40,612 --> 0:19:43,749
It's based on an ancient furnace
made of clay and brick


314
0:19:43,749 --> 0:19:47,252
that was recently uncovered
2,500 miles from Scandinavia,


315
0:19:47,252 --> 0:19:50,923
in Central Asia.


316
0:19:50,923 --> 0:19:55,394
FURRER:
We fill this all the way to the top, to the tippy top,


317
0:19:55,394 --> 0:19:58,297
because we need all the heat,


318
0:19:58,297 --> 0:20:6,238
so we need all the fuel
we can get into the furnace.


319
0:20:6,238 --> 0:20:8,907
The theory is that this is
how they did it


320
0:20:8,907 --> 0:20:15,447
a thousand years ago.


321
0:20:15,447 --> 0:20:18,684
Charcoal will burn
hot enough to melt steel.


322
0:20:18,684 --> 0:20:24,289
The trick is to get it contained
in such a way


323
0:20:24,289 --> 0:20:26,792
that you can deliver
that heat long enough


324
0:20:26,792 --> 0:20:39,338
for the material to melt
inside the crucible.


325
0:20:39,338 --> 0:20:40,973
Almost finished.


326
0:20:40,973 --> 0:20:42,541
We just have two more bricks


327
0:20:42,541 --> 0:20:46,211
and then we've got it sealed up
and ready for the burn run.


328
0:20:46,211 --> 0:20:47,946
If we run this right,


329
0:20:47,946 --> 0:20:50,616
it should get almost
to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit


330
0:20:50,616 --> 0:20:55,354
and we should get a nice full
liquid on our crucible charge.


331
0:20:55,354 --> 0:21:2,427
And then we have our starting
material for the Ulfberht.


332
0:21:2,427 --> 0:21:33,992
Last brick.


333
0:21:33,992 --> 0:21:37,429
NARRATOR:
Closed at the top and vented from the side,


334
0:21:37,429 --> 0:21:40,32
this oven traps more heat


335
0:21:40,32 --> 0:21:47,306
than other European furnaces
of the time.


336
0:21:47,306 --> 0:21:49,441
Ric and his assistant,
Kevin Cashen,


337
0:21:49,441 --> 0:21:52,577
will man the bellows for hours.


338
0:21:52,577 --> 0:22:1,453
In medieval times,
an entire village would help.


339
0:22:1,453 --> 0:22:4,79
The ingredients need to reach
nearly 3,000 degrees


340
0:22:4,79 --> 0:22:11,496
for the slag to separate
from the liquefied steel.


341
0:22:11,496 --> 0:22:14,99
Even the smallest fracture
in the crucible--


342
0:22:14,99 --> 0:22:16,234
the container holding
the steel--


343
0:22:16,234 --> 0:22:19,271
could derail the entire process.


344
0:22:19,271 --> 0:22:21,673
FURRER:
We're hoping that if we run it right,


345
0:22:21,673 --> 0:22:25,77
we're going to end up
with a crucible steel ingot.


346
0:22:25,77 --> 0:22:29,47
But the idea of actually
doing all of these steps


347
0:22:29,47 --> 0:22:32,751
and putting it into one piece
of metal is daunting


348
0:22:32,751 --> 0:22:34,72
because at absolutely
every stage,


349
0:22:34,72 --> 0:22:37,289
you can have a fatal error.


350
0:22:37,289 --> 0:22:42,494
NARRATOR:
The Vikings didn't invent crucible steel.


351
0:22:42,494 --> 0:22:45,197
In fact, there's no evidence


352
0:22:45,197 --> 0:22:47,366
that anyone in Europe
knew how to make it


353
0:22:47,366 --> 0:22:51,336
until the Industrial Revolution
in the 18th century.


354
0:22:51,336 --> 0:22:54,606
But for more than 500 years
before the Ulfberht,


355
0:22:54,606 --> 0:22:56,708
warriors elsewhere
had been fighting


356
0:22:56,708 --> 0:22:59,77
with crucible steel weapons.


357
0:22:59,77 --> 0:23:1,847
Swordsmiths across Central Asia


358
0:23:1,847 --> 0:23:5,15
produced some of the greatest
swords of all time,


359
0:23:5,15 --> 0:23:8,42
known as Damascus steel blades.


360
0:23:8,42 --> 0:23:10,155
Curiously, they were made


361
0:23:10,155 --> 0:23:12,891
from material
similar to the Ulfberht.


362
0:23:12,891 --> 0:23:16,27
WILLIAMS:
Damascus steel is a separate class of crucible steel


363
0:23:16,27 --> 0:23:18,997
which is similar
in chemical composition,


364
0:23:18,997 --> 0:23:22,134
but the crucible steel
was cooled very slowly,


365
0:23:22,134 --> 0:23:25,837
so the iron formed
large crystals.


366
0:23:25,837 --> 0:23:28,74
And with careful forging,


367
0:23:28,74 --> 0:23:35,113
these large crystals form
a surface pattern on the blade.


368
0:23:35,113 --> 0:23:38,85
NARRATOR:
These unusual swords exhibited


369
0:23:38,85 --> 0:23:42,387
many of the same superior
qualities as the Ulfberht.


370
0:23:42,387 --> 0:23:46,491
But if the Vikings didn't know
how to make crucible steel,


371
0:23:46,491 --> 0:23:49,394
then where did they get it?


372
0:23:49,394 --> 0:23:52,798
Clues can be found in artifacts


373
0:23:52,798 --> 0:23:55,6
excavated from Viking graves
in Scandinavia


374
0:23:55,6 --> 0:23:59,37
as early as the eighth century.


375
0:23:59,37 --> 0:24:3,141
ANDERSSON:
The Buddha was found on an island


376
0:24:3,141 --> 0:24:6,278
west of modern-day Stockholm.


377
0:24:6,278 --> 0:24:10,549
It originates from India,
northeast India.


378
0:24:10,549 --> 0:24:13,618
And it tells us, of course,


379
0:24:13,618 --> 0:24:16,788
that trades
with the Far East existed.


380
0:24:16,788 --> 0:24:19,558
The ring is
the same thing there.


381
0:24:19,558 --> 0:24:23,328
It's this written inscription
that says "Allah."


382
0:24:23,328 --> 0:24:26,364
NARRATOR:
Thousands of artifacts from the East


383
0:24:26,364 --> 0:24:28,333
have been uncovered
from Viking graves.


384
0:24:28,333 --> 0:24:33,572
Islamic coins were even commonly
traded in Scandinavia.


385
0:24:33,572 --> 0:24:38,76
You could go mostly
by river and lakes


386
0:24:38,76 --> 0:24:42,314
all the way from Lake Mälaren
here in Sweden to northern Iran.


387
0:24:42,314 --> 0:24:46,251
NARRATOR:
The route was known as the Volga trade route.


388
0:24:46,251 --> 0:24:50,722
LJUNGQVIST:
The interesting thing is that most Ulfberht swords are dated


389
0:24:50,722 --> 0:24:55,93
from exactly the same time when
the Volga trade route was open--


390
0:24:55,93 --> 0:24:59,931
that is, from the early 800s
to the mid-1000s.


391
0:24:59,931 --> 0:25:4,236
I think it's very likely
that the steel that you find


392
0:25:4,236 --> 0:25:8,373
in the Ulfberht swords
originated from Iran.


393
0:25:8,373 --> 0:25:11,209
I would guess that you bought it


394
0:25:11,209 --> 0:25:13,879
from friendly trading
connections in Iran--


395
0:25:13,879 --> 0:25:18,383
paid with furs
and other Nordic commodities--


396
0:25:18,383 --> 0:25:20,619
and took it back
on your small ships


397
0:25:20,619 --> 0:25:22,254
that you used on the rivers.


398
0:25:22,254 --> 0:25:27,726
WILLIAMS:
After the 11th century, the Volga trade route is closed


399
0:25:27,726 --> 0:25:31,563
and the manufacture of these
Ulfberht swords stops,


400
0:25:31,563 --> 0:25:35,367
which, to me, is strong evidence


401
0:25:35,367 --> 0:25:40,539
that they were made out of
an imported raw material.


402
0:25:40,539 --> 0:25:43,141
NARRATOR:
The oven that Ric has used as a model


403
0:25:43,141 --> 0:25:44,876
was found in Central Asia,


404
0:25:44,876 --> 0:25:47,913
near the end
of the Volga trade route.


405
0:25:47,913 --> 0:25:49,814
After five hours,
it's time to see


406
0:25:49,814 --> 0:25:53,385
if he has successfully made
a crucible steel ingot.


407
0:25:53,385 --> 0:25:55,253
FURRER:
I think this burned pretty good,


408
0:25:55,253 --> 0:26:25,317
so we should have
an ingot in there.


409
0:26:25,317 --> 0:26:28,353
NARRATOR:
Most of the impurities have separated from the steel


410
0:26:28,353 --> 0:26:30,922
and been absorbed
by the sand and glass


411
0:26:30,922 --> 0:26:37,495
that fall off with the crucible.


412
0:26:37,495 --> 0:26:39,931
FURRER:
It seems like we have a good ingot.


413
0:26:39,931 --> 0:26:44,169
Let's see if we can turn it
into a good Ulfberht blade.


414
0:26:44,169 --> 0:26:49,874
NARRATOR:
This single piece of steel will make the entire blade.


415
0:26:49,874 --> 0:26:52,31
The absence of lava-like sparks


416
0:26:52,31 --> 0:26:56,81
suggests he's created
slag-free, pure steel.


417
0:26:56,81 --> 0:26:58,316
But the artistry comes


418
0:26:58,316 --> 0:27:1,886
in working the hard,
carbon-rich metal.


419
0:27:1,886 --> 0:27:5,957
FURRER:
This part, this initial breakdown, is terrible.


420
0:27:5,957 --> 0:27:11,96
You have to be very gentle
with it or you can crack it.


421
0:27:11,96 --> 0:27:13,231
NARRATOR:
Crucible steel is difficult to work


422
0:27:13,231 --> 0:27:16,201
because as it cools,
the iron atoms form


423
0:27:16,201 --> 0:27:20,71
interlocking crystalline
structures called dendrites


424
0:27:20,71 --> 0:27:22,841
that look like frost patterns
on a window.


425
0:27:22,841 --> 0:27:25,377
The carbon in crucible steel


426
0:27:25,377 --> 0:27:28,13
makes the areas
around the dendrites rigid


427
0:27:28,13 --> 0:27:30,915
and hard to forge.


428
0:27:30,915 --> 0:27:33,885
FURRER:
It's solidified into this dendritic tree


429
0:27:33,885 --> 0:27:37,956
and it doesn't want to be
anything else.


430
0:27:37,956 --> 0:27:40,625
So you're hitting it and it's
kind of all nestled together.


431
0:27:40,625 --> 0:27:42,661
What you have to do
is just nudge it,


432
0:27:42,661 --> 0:27:44,295
and slowly it breaks down.


433
0:27:44,295 --> 0:27:47,866
And after that, you really
start to enjoy it.


434
0:27:47,866 --> 0:27:50,435
NARRATOR:
It will take eight hours of pounding


435
0:27:50,435 --> 0:27:53,271
just to form the ingot
into a bar.


436
0:27:53,271 --> 0:27:56,274
FURRER:
Two more.


437
0:27:56,274 --> 0:27:58,576
It's breaking down quite nicely.


438
0:27:58,576 --> 0:28:2,414
So now we'll start forming it
out into a longer bar


439
0:28:2,414 --> 0:28:6,51
and draw the sword from there,
but it's looking real good.


440
0:28:6,51 --> 0:28:8,987
NARRATOR:
To test how good it really is,


441
0:28:8,987 --> 0:28:11,856
Ric will send a small piece
of the crucible steel he's made


442
0:28:11,856 --> 0:28:14,25
with his ancient recipe


443
0:28:14,25 --> 0:28:16,327
to the largest steel company
in the world.


444
0:28:16,327 --> 0:28:19,898
ArcelorMittal produces


445
0:28:19,898 --> 0:28:25,77
nearly 100 million tons
of steel a year.


446
0:28:25,77 --> 0:28:29,741
One out of five cars
in the world contains its metal.


447
0:28:29,741 --> 0:28:33,478
RICHARD SUSSMAN:
In the modern steel world,


448
0:28:33,478 --> 0:28:36,181
we try to customize
the recipe for steel


449
0:28:36,181 --> 0:28:38,717
for the particular application,


450
0:28:38,717 --> 0:28:42,153
and so there are now hundreds
of variety of steel


451
0:28:42,153 --> 0:28:44,789
which are suitable
for some applications,


452
0:28:44,789 --> 0:28:47,726
but not for others.


453
0:28:47,726 --> 0:28:50,228
The Vikings, in their day,


454
0:28:50,228 --> 0:28:53,465
I'm sure wanted hardness
on the surface of the sword


455
0:28:53,465 --> 0:28:55,834
so it could cut through easily.


456
0:28:55,834 --> 0:28:57,502
They would want the sword,
however,


457
0:28:57,502 --> 0:29:0,672
not to shatter
or break in combat.


458
0:29:0,672 --> 0:29:2,607
If it got stuck in a shield,


459
0:29:2,607 --> 0:29:4,743
they'd want to be able
to extract it


460
0:29:4,743 --> 0:29:8,79
without it breaking
or twisting or bending,


461
0:29:8,79 --> 0:29:13,17
and they'd want it to be able
to keep its edge.


462
0:29:13,17 --> 0:29:16,988
NARRATOR:
To choose the best metal for a particular application,


463
0:29:16,988 --> 0:29:19,491
Sussman's team
tests the capacity


464
0:29:19,491 --> 0:29:26,731
of different types of steel
to withstand stress.


465
0:29:26,731 --> 0:29:30,802
Today, they'll pit
Ric's crucible steel


466
0:29:30,802 --> 0:29:34,5
against the typical European
metal of the time.


467
0:29:34,5 --> 0:29:36,174
As the Vikings raided their way
across Europe,


468
0:29:36,174 --> 0:29:39,677
this inferior iron is what
an Ulfberht


469
0:29:39,677 --> 0:29:48,286
would most likely have met
in battle.


470
0:29:48,286 --> 0:29:53,691
The metal is brittle
and breaks like a dry twig.


471
0:29:53,691 --> 0:29:56,761
It would have been
a very inferior sword


472
0:29:56,761 --> 0:30:0,64
because it could have
shattered in action.


473
0:30:0,64 --> 0:30:3,902
NARRATOR:
Now the machine will measure whether Ric's crucible steel


474
0:30:3,902 --> 0:30:17,348
will be able to withstand
more stress.


475
0:30:17,348 --> 0:30:19,551
SUSSMAN:
The crucible steel that we were given


476
0:30:19,551 --> 0:30:21,553
had actually very nice
characteristics for a sword,


477
0:30:21,553 --> 0:30:23,421
which you want to have
good strength


478
0:30:23,421 --> 0:30:28,159
but also not shatter in action,


479
0:30:28,159 --> 0:30:30,428
I think good characteristics
overall.


480
0:30:30,428 --> 0:30:32,73
NARRATOR:
An examination of the microstructure


481
0:30:32,73 --> 0:30:35,5
with a scanning electron
microscope


482
0:30:35,5 --> 0:30:37,368
will reveal whether Ric
has succeeded


483
0:30:37,368 --> 0:30:41,139
in making a slag-free,
pure steel.


484
0:30:41,139 --> 0:30:43,675
TECHNICIAN:
As we're moving along here across the surface,


485
0:30:43,675 --> 0:30:47,912
it's quite interesting
how clean it is.


486
0:30:47,912 --> 0:30:50,615
NARRATOR:
The image is nearly free of slag


487
0:30:50,615 --> 0:30:53,618
and other inclusions
that appear as dark circles.


488
0:30:53,618 --> 0:30:56,588
SUSSMAN:
The inclusions are very small and very minute


489
0:30:56,588 --> 0:30:59,224
and very widely distributed.


490
0:30:59,224 --> 0:31:2,6
NARRATOR:
2,000 years after it was invented, Sussman--


491
0:31:2,6 --> 0:31:5,897
who has spent decades
developing modern steels--


492
0:31:5,897 --> 0:31:10,802
gives Ric's crucible steel
what for him is high praise.


493
0:31:10,802 --> 0:31:13,504
SUSSMAN:
This would be a fairly decent steel today.


494
0:31:13,504 --> 0:31:15,206
Considering the lack


495
0:31:15,206 --> 0:31:18,76
of metallurgical knowledge
in its day


496
0:31:18,76 --> 0:31:21,312
and the tools
that were available


497
0:31:21,312 --> 0:31:26,718
compared to steel making today,
it's not bad.


498
0:31:26,718 --> 0:31:30,722
NARRATOR:
After 11 hours of pounding,


499
0:31:30,722 --> 0:31:37,395
Ric has transformed his piece
of crucible steel into a blade.


500
0:31:37,395 --> 0:31:41,432
FURRER:
We have the blade profiled, and now we're going to start


501
0:31:41,432 --> 0:31:46,137
refining the tip
to its final shape.


502
0:31:46,137 --> 0:31:48,172
So now it's going to start
looking like a sword;


503
0:31:48,172 --> 0:31:49,908
it's no longer a bar of steel.


504
0:31:49,908 --> 0:31:57,615
It's going to start to take on
its final shape.


505
0:31:57,615 --> 0:31:59,817
NARRATOR:
Ric's sword will eventually be more pointed,


506
0:31:59,817 --> 0:32:2,287
like all Ulfberhts.


507
0:32:2,287 --> 0:32:3,855
FURRER:
One more.


508
0:32:3,855 --> 0:32:5,29
Flat.


509
0:32:5,29 --> 0:32:6,624
CLEMENTS:
The swords of the Norse


510
0:32:6,624 --> 0:32:7,992
tended to be swords
that are designed


511
0:32:7,992 --> 0:32:11,829
to get through the mail armor
that they're wearing,


512
0:32:11,829 --> 0:32:13,464
the chain linked armor.


513
0:32:13,464 --> 0:32:17,735
And that requires
a different point


514
0:32:17,735 --> 0:32:20,638
and a different cross-sectional
geometry.


515
0:32:20,638 --> 0:32:24,8
They changed the way
their swords were shaped


516
0:32:24,8 --> 0:32:30,48
to facilitate thrusting
through that mail.


517
0:32:30,48 --> 0:32:32,183
NARRATOR:
To show the advantages of the pointed swords


518
0:32:32,183 --> 0:32:33,718
that emerged in the Viking era,


519
0:32:33,718 --> 0:32:39,123
first Clements tests an earlier
replica sword from Roman times


520
0:32:39,123 --> 0:32:42,393
against Viking-era chain mail.


521
0:32:42,393 --> 0:32:45,63
Designed to slash at opponents
from horseback,


522
0:32:45,63 --> 0:32:58,876
it has a more rounded tip.


523
0:32:58,876 --> 0:33:0,945
I don't think a single ring


524
0:33:0,945 --> 0:33:7,151
was deformed, split, popped,
or in any way damaged.


525
0:33:7,151 --> 0:33:10,388
So obviously a point
that's more rounded,


526
0:33:10,388 --> 0:33:13,624
hitting the mail is not going
to do as much on puncturing


527
0:33:13,624 --> 0:33:16,928
or on even catching it


528
0:33:16,928 --> 0:33:19,597
as will a narrow, tapered,
harder point


529
0:33:19,597 --> 0:33:21,232
that will get through.


530
0:33:21,232 --> 0:33:38,583
So this Viking-era blade has
a slight taper to the point.


531
0:33:38,583 --> 0:33:42,153
Sure enough, it popped
about two or three rivets--


532
0:33:42,153 --> 0:33:44,422
there is the puncture,
there is the cut--


533
0:33:44,422 --> 0:33:47,225
and I could feel the blade
getting through the cloth


534
0:33:47,225 --> 0:33:50,661
and getting into that rubber
and that foam underneath.


535
0:33:50,661 --> 0:33:52,63
A blade like this,


536
0:33:52,63 --> 0:33:59,437
definitely progress in the arms
race between swords and armor.


537
0:33:59,437 --> 0:34:2,673
NARRATOR:
The Ulfberht's shape was perfectly suited


538
0:34:2,673 --> 0:34:5,476
to meet the martial challenges
of its time.


539
0:34:5,476 --> 0:34:10,381
But its true excellence stemmed
from its unusual metal


540
0:34:10,381 --> 0:34:14,986
and from the intangible value
of its name.


541
0:34:14,986 --> 0:34:17,321
FURRER:
We're at the point now where we do the inlay,


542
0:34:17,321 --> 0:34:26,33
or the cutting of the inlay,
for the name "Ulfberht."


543
0:34:26,33 --> 0:34:27,965
We've got the cross.


544
0:34:27,965 --> 0:34:34,305
U-L-F-B-E is more or less
centered, R-H-cross-T.


545
0:34:34,305 --> 0:34:38,476
NARRATOR:
Like his mysterious predecessor a thousand years ago,


546
0:34:38,476 --> 0:34:42,413
Ric's taking a chance
by branding the sword.


547
0:34:42,413 --> 0:34:47,385
(hammering)


548
0:34:47,385 --> 0:34:50,688
FURRER:
There is some argument that the cuts actually weaken the blade,


549
0:34:50,688 --> 0:34:52,59
so if I do this wrong


550
0:34:52,59 --> 0:34:55,526
I'll have to start over
from the beginning.


551
0:34:55,526 --> 0:35:0,98
RISVAAG:
As one might see here, that is the "B" in "Ulfberht."


552
0:35:0,98 --> 0:35:2,166
And as you can see there,


553
0:35:2,166 --> 0:35:4,869
it stands out from the rest
of the sword.


554
0:35:4,869 --> 0:35:6,604
If you look closely,


555
0:35:6,604 --> 0:35:9,44
you can see that some parts
of the lettering


556
0:35:9,44 --> 0:35:12,143
are actually starting
to come off


557
0:35:12,143 --> 0:35:14,378
because it's been
through a hard time


558
0:35:14,378 --> 0:35:17,815
both in the earth
and through the burial.


559
0:35:17,815 --> 0:35:22,487
But this is a very highly
skilled craftsman doing this.


560
0:35:22,487 --> 0:35:25,49
It's not very easy to do that.


561
0:35:25,49 --> 0:35:28,459
FURRER:
This is one of the many make-or-break points


562
0:35:28,459 --> 0:35:32,296
in this sword manufacture


563
0:35:32,296 --> 0:35:34,265
because we have to cut
the name just right


564
0:35:34,265 --> 0:35:37,34
and inlay the contrasting
iron letter


565
0:35:37,34 --> 0:35:41,439
into the crucible steel blade.


566
0:35:41,439 --> 0:35:44,342
So I'll carve it
with a few chisels


567
0:35:44,342 --> 0:35:54,452
and then we'll inset
the twisted iron inlay.


568
0:35:54,452 --> 0:35:56,621
The fact that they went
through the labor


569
0:35:56,621 --> 0:35:58,99
to give it that amount
of extra effort,


570
0:35:58,99 --> 0:36:2,16
that amount of power
by inlaying this name


571
0:36:2,16 --> 0:36:5,363
made them more valuable.


572
0:36:5,363 --> 0:36:10,134
Why they put this on, it's...
we don't know.


573
0:36:10,134 --> 0:36:12,236
We are quite puzzled.


574
0:36:12,236 --> 0:36:14,939
But it might be
because it was...


575
0:36:14,939 --> 0:36:16,841
they were making a statement:


576
0:36:16,841 --> 0:36:22,547
"This is the real deal,
this is something of quality."


577
0:36:22,547 --> 0:36:25,816
But Ulfberht is actually
an enigma;


578
0:36:25,816 --> 0:36:29,787
we don't know who Ulfberht was.


579
0:36:29,787 --> 0:36:31,422
LJUNGQVIST:
We have no examples


580
0:36:31,422 --> 0:36:34,725
from the written sources
from the time of the name.


581
0:36:34,725 --> 0:36:36,627
It does not appear anywhere.


582
0:36:36,627 --> 0:36:41,799
NARRATOR:
So what can this name tell us about who made these swords?


583
0:36:41,799 --> 0:36:46,671
The fact that Ulfberhts appear
over a 200-year period means


584
0:36:46,671 --> 0:36:49,941
they couldn't have been produced
by a single craftsman.


585
0:36:49,941 --> 0:36:52,944
But the name seems to be
Frankish--


586
0:36:52,944 --> 0:36:56,581
from a medieval empire that
included France and Germany--


587
0:36:56,581 --> 0:36:59,584
and the signature holds
an important clue.


588
0:36:59,584 --> 0:37:2,82
RISVAAG:
There's actually a small cross in front of the name,


589
0:37:2,82 --> 0:37:5,69
and ordinary people
would not put a cross


590
0:37:5,69 --> 0:37:8,292
in front of their name.


591
0:37:8,292 --> 0:37:10,361
NARRATOR:
During the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church


592
0:37:10,361 --> 0:37:14,298
dominated the Frankish empire
and more.


593
0:37:14,298 --> 0:37:17,468
A frequent enemy
of the pagan Vikings,


594
0:37:17,468 --> 0:37:22,139
the church was a major arms
producer and arms dealer.


595
0:37:22,139 --> 0:37:26,41
LJUNGQVIST:
The Greek cross before a signature


596
0:37:26,41 --> 0:37:28,946
was only used
by bishops and abbots.


597
0:37:28,946 --> 0:37:31,782
And so the signature tells us


598
0:37:31,782 --> 0:37:34,885
that it was either a bishop's
name or an abbot's name,


599
0:37:34,885 --> 0:37:37,355
or maybe even the name
of a monastery.


600
0:37:37,355 --> 0:37:40,391
NARRATOR:
It's possible that the swords were manufactured


601
0:37:40,391 --> 0:37:43,127
by the Vikings' rivals
in the Roman Catholic Church


602
0:37:43,127 --> 0:37:46,998
and then somehow smuggled north.


603
0:37:46,998 --> 0:37:49,333
LJUNGQVIST:
But we have no way of really knowing


604
0:37:49,333 --> 0:37:52,837
how the Vikings got possession
of the Ulfberht swords


605
0:37:52,837 --> 0:37:56,507
since it was forbidden to trade
with the Scandinavians.


606
0:37:56,507 --> 0:37:59,477
NARRATOR:
If people in the church did make the swords,


607
0:37:59,477 --> 0:38:3,47
it begs the question how
they got the crucible steel.


608
0:38:3,47 --> 0:38:6,117
Many experts agree that it
was brought by the Vikings


609
0:38:6,117 --> 0:38:9,42
from Central Asia
or the Middle East,


610
0:38:9,42 --> 0:38:13,357
so perhaps the Vikings
themselves


611
0:38:13,357 --> 0:38:17,361
were the craftsmen, despite
the foreign inscription.


612
0:38:17,361 --> 0:38:21,565
WILLIAMS:
There are lots of reasons why a Scandinavian


613
0:38:21,565 --> 0:38:28,472
might have used a foreign word
and have used the cross.


614
0:38:28,472 --> 0:38:31,142
It might have been magic,


615
0:38:31,142 --> 0:38:34,845
it might have been
copying symbols


616
0:38:34,845 --> 0:38:37,748
from the disappeared
Roman Empire,


617
0:38:37,748 --> 0:38:38,849
it might have been
simply because


618
0:38:38,849 --> 0:38:41,385
somebody thought
they liked the name,


619
0:38:41,385 --> 0:38:43,587
like putting the name "Apple"
on a computer.


620
0:38:43,587 --> 0:38:47,58
There are dozens
of possible reasons


621
0:38:47,58 --> 0:38:49,193
why the makers of these swords


622
0:38:49,193 --> 0:38:52,296
could have used
the Frankish name Ulfberht.


623
0:38:52,296 --> 0:38:55,633
RISVAAG:
So if you look at this mystery,


624
0:38:55,633 --> 0:38:57,968
this enigma of this person
Ulfberht,


625
0:38:57,968 --> 0:39:0,738
who he was and what kind
of position he had,


626
0:39:0,738 --> 0:39:2,807
it might not ever be solved.


627
0:39:2,807 --> 0:39:9,18
I wonder who he was,
or rather who they were,


628
0:39:9,18 --> 0:39:12,183
or what this inscription meant


629
0:39:12,183 --> 0:39:14,819
to the people that
owned the swords.


630
0:39:14,819 --> 0:39:15,953
Because we don't know


631
0:39:15,953 --> 0:39:18,889
if Ulfberht is a kenning--
a word of power.


632
0:39:18,889 --> 0:39:22,226
Could be an area,


633
0:39:22,226 --> 0:39:26,864
could have been a workshop
because these spanned 150 years.


634
0:39:26,864 --> 0:39:33,971
So I wonder about
a lot of things.


635
0:39:33,971 --> 0:39:40,711
But if you think too much
about other things...


636
0:39:40,711 --> 0:39:47,651
...you make mistakes.


637
0:39:47,651 --> 0:39:50,821
NARRATOR:
Whoever or whatever Ulfberht may have been,


638
0:39:50,821 --> 0:39:53,357
the inlaid lettering
helped reassure customers


639
0:39:53,357 --> 0:39:57,94
they were buying
from a master craftsman.


640
0:39:57,94 --> 0:39:58,896
That looks all right.


641
0:39:58,896 --> 0:40:0,231
Let's set it.


642
0:40:0,231 --> 0:40:21,952
Give me one good hit.


643
0:40:21,952 --> 0:40:24,422
NARRATOR:
Once the letters are pounded into place,


644
0:40:24,422 --> 0:40:26,724
they are heat treated.


645
0:40:26,724 --> 0:40:28,559
But Ric won't know
if they have set properly


646
0:40:28,559 --> 0:40:31,529
until the end of the process,
when the sword is polished


647
0:40:31,529 --> 0:40:34,965
and the thick layer of iron
oxide that's accumulated


648
0:40:34,965 --> 0:40:37,868
is removed from the surface.


649
0:40:37,868 --> 0:40:41,772
FURRER:
I'm putting in all of this work to make this blade.


650
0:40:41,772 --> 0:40:43,941
And if it does work,


651
0:40:43,941 --> 0:40:49,13
you still have hours
and hours of polishing


652
0:40:49,13 --> 0:40:52,85
to verify that all the work
you did up to that point


653
0:40:52,85 --> 0:40:56,22
actually made a good sword,


654
0:40:56,22 --> 0:41:0,691
and that the letters exist.


655
0:41:0,691 --> 0:41:4,128
And if it doesn't work,
it really sucks.


656
0:41:4,128 --> 0:41:8,866
You just end up with a piece
of recyclable material.


657
0:41:8,866 --> 0:41:11,669
NARRATOR:
With the letters welded in place,


658
0:41:11,669 --> 0:41:18,409
Ric must now make something
called the fuller.


659
0:41:18,409 --> 0:41:22,746
The fuller is an indentation
down the center of the blade.


660
0:41:22,746 --> 0:41:28,752
It reveals the ingenuity
of Viking Age craftsmen.


661
0:41:28,752 --> 0:41:30,921
FURRER:
You've got the start of the fuller,


662
0:41:30,921 --> 0:41:33,39
and that will get progressively
deeper as we go.


663
0:41:33,39 --> 0:41:36,627
We're just going to bring that
all the way up the blade.


664
0:41:36,627 --> 0:41:42,366
The fuller allows longer blades,
wider blades,


665
0:41:42,366 --> 0:41:49,6
yet the same weight as thicker,
unfullered pieces of steel


666
0:41:49,6 --> 0:41:54,111
because it acts like an I-beam.


667
0:41:54,111 --> 0:41:58,282
An I-beam has structural members
here and a horizontal.


668
0:41:58,282 --> 0:42:2,52
So here we have the fuller
acting as the horizontal


669
0:42:2,52 --> 0:42:4,889
and a little bit
thicker material,


670
0:42:4,889 --> 0:42:6,924
and then going down
to a cutting edge.


671
0:42:6,924 --> 0:42:11,929
So you have the minimal amount
of material


672
0:42:11,929 --> 0:42:15,332
to give you the maximum amount
of strength.


673
0:42:15,332 --> 0:42:17,935
So in this time period,


674
0:42:17,935 --> 0:42:20,704
the blades are getting longer
and longer and longer,


675
0:42:20,704 --> 0:42:23,107
but the weight remains
about the same.


676
0:42:23,107 --> 0:42:29,98
A completed sword weighs about
two pounds, a little bit less.


677
0:42:29,98 --> 0:42:32,82
About like a baseball bat.


678
0:42:32,82 --> 0:42:34,652
Swords weigh about what
a baseball bat weighs.


679
0:42:34,652 --> 0:42:41,725
NARRATOR:
The fuller made longer blades lighter.


680
0:42:41,725 --> 0:42:43,861
LYNNERUP:
You're fighting for your life.


681
0:42:43,861 --> 0:42:49,266
You need to use every
opportunity you can to strike.


682
0:42:49,266 --> 0:42:51,302
Some of these Viking swords
are heavy,


683
0:42:51,302 --> 0:42:55,72
you just don't move like
the Three Musketeers easily.


684
0:42:55,72 --> 0:42:57,641
It takes some force
to wield the sword


685
0:42:57,641 --> 0:43:2,846
and having done a full stroke,
you need to swing it back up.


686
0:43:2,846 --> 0:43:5,115
NARRATOR:
If a fighter didn't get his sword up fast enough


687
0:43:5,115 --> 0:43:12,923
to strike an opponent, he might
not get another chance.


688
0:43:12,923 --> 0:43:16,293
These victims
of a Viking attack--


689
0:43:16,293 --> 0:43:19,163
found in a mass grave
in southern Greenland--


690
0:43:19,163 --> 0:43:22,933
all show clear evidence
of blows to the head.


691
0:43:22,933 --> 0:43:24,969
LYNNERUP:
In a forensic context, what we're looking at


692
0:43:24,969 --> 0:43:28,939
is the velocity and the weight
of the swords.


693
0:43:28,939 --> 0:43:31,308
If we take this skull here,


694
0:43:31,308 --> 0:43:34,979
we can see a very clear
marked cut edge.


695
0:43:34,979 --> 0:43:38,382
This is where the weapon struck
and actually managed


696
0:43:38,382 --> 0:43:40,484
to cut through
quite a lot of the skull


697
0:43:40,484 --> 0:43:42,72
before finally some
of the bone here was crushed


698
0:43:42,72 --> 0:43:45,789
and then the sword
was taken out.


699
0:43:45,789 --> 0:43:50,494
And this blow would certainly
have been deadly.


700
0:43:50,494 --> 0:43:55,332
NARRATOR:
When a warrior was killed in violent combat,


701
0:43:55,332 --> 0:43:57,635
the living often
took precautions


702
0:43:57,635 --> 0:44:0,27
to avoid his wrath
in the afterlife.


703
0:44:0,27 --> 0:44:2,806
ANDERSSON:
If you bent the sword,


704
0:44:2,806 --> 0:44:5,809
you also destroy the power
of the sword, right,


705
0:44:5,809 --> 0:44:8,345
and you bury it together


706
0:44:8,345 --> 0:44:10,981
with the person that owned it,
and in that way,


707
0:44:10,981 --> 0:44:14,351
you made sure that
the powers of the weapon


708
0:44:14,351 --> 0:44:17,454
were buried as well
and killed as well.


709
0:44:17,454 --> 0:44:18,689
NARRATOR:
Hundreds of swords


710
0:44:18,689 --> 0:44:20,424
which were heated
and then bent


711
0:44:20,424 --> 0:44:24,762
have been unearthed
from Viking graves.


712
0:44:24,762 --> 0:44:27,631
RISVAAG:
If you took a sword off an enemy,


713
0:44:27,631 --> 0:44:31,535
you would make damn sure


714
0:44:31,535 --> 0:44:33,57
that he didn't come back
in the afterlife


715
0:44:33,57 --> 0:44:36,907
and bother you with the sword,


716
0:44:36,907 --> 0:44:41,979
so it's sort of a ritual killing
of the sword, too.


717
0:44:41,979 --> 0:44:45,849
NARRATOR:
Ric is heating his sword for another purpose.


718
0:44:45,849 --> 0:44:50,187
He has reached the riskiest part
of the entire process.


719
0:44:50,187 --> 0:44:51,855
It's called the quench.


720
0:44:51,855 --> 0:44:54,324
FURRER:
The quench is where it's really born.


721
0:44:54,324 --> 0:44:57,161
It's just a piece of metal until
it comes out of the quench.


722
0:44:57,161 --> 0:44:59,63
NARRATOR:
The goal of the quench is


723
0:44:59,63 --> 0:45:2,833
to harden the sword by heating,
then rapidly cooling it.


724
0:45:2,833 --> 0:45:4,768
We know now that this affects


725
0:45:4,768 --> 0:45:7,204
the atomic structure
of the metal.


726
0:45:7,204 --> 0:45:11,642
According to legend, ancient
blacksmiths cooled their swords


727
0:45:11,642 --> 0:45:14,111
with anything from water
to dragon's blood.


728
0:45:14,111 --> 0:45:17,214
But Ric will use oil.


729
0:45:17,214 --> 0:45:20,984
He'll quench the sword
when the blade glows


730
0:45:20,984 --> 0:45:23,52
a consistent dull orange.


731
0:45:23,52 --> 0:45:25,723
FURRER:
Up until the last few minutes,


732
0:45:25,723 --> 0:45:28,325
all the prior work
can be destroyed.


733
0:45:28,325 --> 0:45:33,564
This one has so much technology
going into it, so much time.


734
0:45:33,564 --> 0:45:39,837
If it breaks in the quench, I'm
going to be absolutely gutted.


735
0:45:39,837 --> 0:45:43,407
NARRATOR:
It's uncertain whether the makers of the original Ulfberhts


736
0:45:43,407 --> 0:45:46,9
quenched their swords.


737
0:45:46,9 --> 0:45:50,214
But Ric believes they did,
and thinks it offers final proof


738
0:45:50,214 --> 0:45:53,55
of a blacksmith's mastery
over the metal.


739
0:45:53,55 --> 0:45:56,253
FURRER:
I'm in love with the steel--


740
0:45:56,253 --> 0:45:59,99
this very primal interaction
with this raw material


741
0:45:59,99 --> 0:46:1,892
that's largely unforgiving,


742
0:46:1,892 --> 0:46:4,962
and even if you treat it right,


743
0:46:4,962 --> 0:46:7,264
absolutely everything
can go wrong.


744
0:46:7,264 --> 0:46:9,967
We're coming up nice.


745
0:46:9,967 --> 0:46:12,77
NARRATOR:
The quench will make the blade hard


746
0:46:12,77 --> 0:46:16,6
but it can also crack the sword.


747
0:46:16,6 --> 0:46:21,845
The ping is the audible sound
of the steel cracking.


748
0:46:21,845 --> 0:46:24,381
So we hear it as a tink
or a ping,


749
0:46:24,381 --> 0:46:27,151
and that means that
somewhere along that blade,


750
0:46:27,151 --> 0:46:31,255
it has cracked
and we need to start over.


751
0:46:31,255 --> 0:46:34,958
I think we're about there...


752
0:46:34,958 --> 0:46:37,828
We'll know within
about ten seconds of the quench


753
0:46:37,828 --> 0:46:39,997
if we got a good sword or not.


754
0:46:39,997 --> 0:46:44,101
I think we're going to go
for a quench.


755
0:46:44,101 --> 0:46:50,374
Like maybe right now.


756
0:46:50,374 --> 0:47:9,893
(hissing)


757
0:47:9,893 --> 0:47:11,762
No ping!


758
0:47:11,762 --> 0:47:13,897
Did not crack.


759
0:47:13,897 --> 0:47:18,402
A little bit of straightening--
it's a little bent--


760
0:47:18,402 --> 0:47:21,471
but we can handle that.


761
0:47:21,471 --> 0:47:27,244
I don't think a crucible steel
with bloomery letter Ulfberht


762
0:47:27,244 --> 0:47:30,28
has been made
since the originals.


763
0:47:30,28 --> 0:47:35,85
So it's been 900
to 1,000 years.


764
0:47:35,85 --> 0:47:42,993
We have an Ulfberht!


765
0:47:42,993 --> 0:47:47,731
I think we've got a good blade.


766
0:47:47,731 --> 0:47:50,934
I want to see the name.


767
0:47:50,934 --> 0:47:55,839
I've waited quite a while
to see the name.


768
0:47:55,839 --> 0:47:59,9
NARRATOR:
The name will remain hidden


769
0:47:59,9 --> 0:48:1,445
until the sword cools
and Ric can polish it.


770
0:48:1,445 --> 0:48:4,848
But after a thousand years,


771
0:48:4,848 --> 0:48:6,817
the mysterious Ulfberht
inscription


772
0:48:6,817 --> 0:48:12,256
has one more secret to reveal.


773
0:48:12,256 --> 0:48:17,761
As of today, Alan Williams
has examined 44 Ulfberhts


774
0:48:17,761 --> 0:48:19,263
across five countries


775
0:48:19,263 --> 0:48:23,133
and has made one
final discovery.


776
0:48:23,133 --> 0:48:27,971
WILLIAMS:
Some swords have the name "Ulfberht" spelled


777
0:48:27,971 --> 0:48:33,1
"cross-U-L-F-B-E-R-H-cross-T,"


778
0:48:33,1 --> 0:48:37,18
and some have them spelled
"H-T-cross."


779
0:48:37,18 --> 0:48:41,218
Those that were spelled
"H-cross-T"


780
0:48:41,218 --> 0:48:44,488
had the very high carbon steel,


781
0:48:44,488 --> 0:48:47,691
whereas the swords


782
0:48:47,691 --> 0:48:50,694
which had the Ulfberht name
spelled differently


783
0:48:50,694 --> 0:48:55,565
were made of much lower carbon
steel, much inferior steel.


784
0:48:55,565 --> 0:48:57,668
These must have been copies.


785
0:48:57,668 --> 0:49:3,941
NARRATOR:
Of the 44 Ulfberhts that Williams has examined,


786
0:49:3,941 --> 0:49:8,412
33 are not made
of crucible steel.


787
0:49:8,412 --> 0:49:14,318
RISVAAG:
You can see here the R, the H, the T and the last cross.


788
0:49:14,318 --> 0:49:16,62
WILLIAMS:
They are contemporary fakes, of course;


789
0:49:16,62 --> 0:49:18,221
they were made at the same time


790
0:49:18,221 --> 0:49:23,827
by people trying to cash in
on the reputation of Ulfberht.


791
0:49:23,827 --> 0:49:28,65
They were probably made
by illiterate craftsmen


792
0:49:28,65 --> 0:49:30,934
for illiterate customers.


793
0:49:30,934 --> 0:49:35,205
It's the Armani or the Gucci
or whatever, or the Porsche,


794
0:49:35,205 --> 0:49:40,911
so you want to copy the brand.


795
0:49:40,911 --> 0:49:43,13
WILLIAMS:
To the unsuspecting buyer,


796
0:49:43,13 --> 0:49:45,882
it appears to be
the genuine Ulfberht,


797
0:49:45,882 --> 0:49:49,653
but there's a much greater
chance of it snapping,


798
0:49:49,653 --> 0:49:53,256
which is, of course, extremely
embarrassing in battle.


799
0:49:53,256 --> 0:49:56,893
NARRATOR:
Ric's sword is made from crucible steel


800
0:49:56,893 --> 0:50:4,468
and bears the inscription
of a genuine Ulfberht, cross-t.


801
0:50:4,468 --> 0:50:7,237
But before his sword can truly
be called an Ulfberht,


802
0:50:7,237 --> 0:50:11,8
he must see if the inlaid name
has survived the process.


803
0:50:11,8 --> 0:50:14,611
After tempering, or reheating,
the sword a final time


804
0:50:14,611 --> 0:50:19,75
to keep it from becoming too
brittle, he begins to polish.


805
0:50:19,75 --> 0:50:21,418
FURRER:
It can take a few days of rubbing


806
0:50:21,418 --> 0:50:25,655
by all handwork
to get these cleaned up


807
0:50:25,655 --> 0:50:35,399
and looking like people
assume swords look.


808
0:50:35,399 --> 0:50:41,238
It was the luster of the metal
that made people lust after it.


809
0:50:41,238 --> 0:50:46,276
In a world of mud and trees
and rock,


810
0:50:46,276 --> 0:50:54,418
you have the polished metal,
and that was different.


811
0:50:54,418 --> 0:50:57,521
NARRATOR:
He uses increasingly fine grained stones


812
0:50:57,521 --> 0:51:1,491
to polish the sword, and only
then will he sharpen it.


813
0:51:1,491 --> 0:51:4,861
But he still can't be sure
if the inlay has survived.


814
0:51:4,861 --> 0:51:8,131
FURRER:
If the inlay survives all of the grinding,


815
0:51:8,131 --> 0:51:13,303
what will happen is if we add
an etchant to it, an acid,


816
0:51:13,303 --> 0:51:15,405
then that should create
enough of a contrast


817
0:51:15,405 --> 0:51:17,374
between the two materials


818
0:51:17,374 --> 0:51:19,476
to where the name should be
easily readable.


819
0:51:19,476 --> 0:51:35,25
We'll see how well I did.


820
0:51:35,25 --> 0:51:37,794
The cross.


821
0:51:37,794 --> 0:51:47,337
U-L-F-B-E-R-H-cross-T.


822
0:51:47,337 --> 0:51:50,307
It looks really good.


823
0:51:50,307 --> 0:51:52,909
It was a good inlay.


824
0:51:52,909 --> 0:51:55,579
It's gonna be a fine sword.


825
0:51:55,579 --> 0:51:58,949
I think it's worthy of the name.


826
0:51:58,949 --> 0:52:6,923
Worthy of the name Ulfberht.


827
0:52:6,923 --> 0:52:9,126
Here we are talking
about a sword


828
0:52:9,126 --> 0:52:12,496
that was made last
a thousand years ago.


829
0:52:12,496 --> 0:52:18,401
I see myself as a caretaker
of this knowledge.


830
0:52:18,401 --> 0:52:21,705
I can't make a blade
better than this.


831
0:52:21,705 --> 0:52:25,976
It represents my entire
skill set as it sits now,


832
0:52:25,976 --> 0:52:40,991
sitting there in a two-pound
chunk of steel.
