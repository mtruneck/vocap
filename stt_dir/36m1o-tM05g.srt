0:0:18,23 --> 0:0:20,217
Hello everyone.


2
0:0:20,217 --> 0:0:21,634
I'm Sam,


3
0:0:21,634 --> 0:0:24,401
and I just turned 17.


4
0:0:24,401 --> 0:0:27,648
A few years ago,
before my freshman year in High School,


5
0:0:27,648 --> 0:0:32,852
I wanted to play snare drum
in the Foxboro High School Marching Band,


6
0:0:32,852 --> 0:0:35,589
and it was a dream
that I just had to accomplish.


7
0:0:35,589 --> 0:0:37,852
But each snare drum and harness


8
0:0:37,852 --> 0:0:40,155
weighed about 40 pounds each,


9
0:0:40,155 --> 0:0:42,77
and I have a disease called Progeria.


10
0:0:42,77 --> 0:0:46,858
So just to give you an idea,
I weigh only about 50 pounds.


11
0:0:46,858 --> 0:0:51,615
So, logistically, I really couldn't carry
a regular sized snare drum,


12
0:0:51,615 --> 0:0:55,654
and because of this the band director
assigned me to play


13
0:0:55,654 --> 0:0:59,5
pit percussion during the halftime show.


14
0:0:59,5 --> 0:1:1,11
Now pit percussion was fun.


15
0:1:1,11 --> 0:1:4,803
It involved some really cool
auxiliary percussion instruments,


16
0:1:4,803 --> 0:1:8,623
like the bongos, timpani,


17
0:1:8,623 --> 0:1:11,107
and timbales, and cowbell.


18
0:1:11,107 --> 0:1:13,318
So it was fun,


19
0:1:13,318 --> 0:1:18,42
but it involved no marching,
and I was just so devastated.


20
0:1:18,42 --> 0:1:20,914
However, nothing was going 
to stop me


21
0:1:20,914 --> 0:1:23,585
from playing snare drum
with the marching band


22
0:1:23,585 --> 0:1:25,1
in the halftime show.


23
0:1:25,1 --> 0:1:29,865
So my family and I worked
with an engineer to design


24
0:1:29,865 --> 0:1:31,793
a snare drum harness


25
0:1:31,793 --> 0:1:35,58
that would be lighter,
and easier for me to carry.


26
0:1:35,58 --> 0:1:39,638
So after continuous work, we made


27
0:1:39,638 --> 0:1:43,859
a snare drum apparatus
that weighs only about 6 pounds.


28
0:1:43,859 --> 0:1:48,129
(Applause)


29
0:1:48,129 --> 0:1:52,427
I just want to give you some more
information about Progeria.


30
0:1:52,427 --> 0:1:58,34
It affects only about
350 kids today, worldwide.


31
0:1:58,34 --> 0:2:0,88
So it's pretty rare,


32
0:2:0,88 --> 0:2:3,335
and the effects of Progeria include:


33
0:2:3,335 --> 0:2:7,408
tight skin, lack of weight gain,
stunted growth,


34
0:2:7,408 --> 0:2:9,11
and heart disease.


35
0:2:9,11 --> 0:2:12,586
Last year my Mom 
and her team of scientists


36
0:2:12,586 --> 0:2:16,725
published the first successful
Progeria Treatment Study,


37
0:2:16,725 --> 0:2:19,46
and because of this
I was interviewed on NPR,


38
0:2:19,46 --> 0:2:22,6
and John Hamilton asked me
the question:


39
0:2:22,6 --> 0:2:24,272
"What is the most important thing


40
0:2:24,272 --> 0:2:26,538
that people should know about you?"


41
0:2:26,538 --> 0:2:29,264
And my answer was simply that


42
0:2:29,264 --> 0:2:31,691
I have a very happy life.


43
0:2:31,691 --> 0:2:35,762
(Applause)


44
0:2:35,762 --> 0:2:39,663
So even though
there are many obstacles in my life,


45
0:2:39,663 --> 0:2:42,533
with a lot of them
being created by Progeria,


46
0:2:42,533 --> 0:2:45,95
I don't want people to feel bad for me.


47
0:2:45,95 --> 0:2:47,802
I don't think about
these obstacles all the time,


48
0:2:47,802 --> 0:2:51,7
and I'm able to overcome
most of them anyway.


49
0:2:51,7 --> 0:2:56,132
So I’m here today, to share with you
my philosophy for a happy life.


50
0:2:56,132 --> 0:3:0,757
So, for me,
there are 3 aspects to this philosophy.


51
0:3:0,757 --> 0:3:4,83
So this is a quote
from the famous Ferris Bueller.


52
0:3:4,83 --> 0:3:8,516
The first aspect to my philosophy is that


53
0:3:8,516 --> 0:3:11,552
I’m okay with what I ultimately can’t do


54
0:3:11,552 --> 0:3:14,32
because there is so much I can do.


55
0:3:14,32 --> 0:3:16,799
Now people sometimes 
ask me questions like,


56
0:3:16,799 --> 0:3:19,252
&quot;Isn’t it hard living with Progeria?&quot;, or


57
0:3:19,252 --> 0:3:22,569
"What daily challenges
of Progeria do you face?"


58
0:3:22,569 --> 0:3:26,53
And I’d like to say that,
even though I have Progeria,


59
0:3:26,53 --> 0:3:28,686
most of my time
is spent thinking about things


60
0:3:28,686 --> 0:3:31,534
that have nothing to do
with Progeria at all.


61
0:3:31,534 --> 0:3:36,435
Now this doesn’t mean that I ignore
the negative aspects of these obstacles.


62
0:3:36,435 --> 0:3:38,491
When I can’t do something like


63
0:3:38,491 --> 0:3:42,557
run a long distance,
or go on an intense roller coaster,


64
0:3:42,557 --> 0:3:44,583
I know what I’m missing out on.


65
0:3:44,583 --> 0:3:48,499
But instead,
I choose to focus on the activities


66
0:3:48,499 --> 0:3:52,276
that I can do through things
that I’m passionate about,


67
0:3:52,276 --> 0:3:55,791
like scouting, or music, or comic books,


68
0:3:55,791 --> 0:3:58,756
or any of my favorite Boston sports teams.


69
0:3:58,756 --> 0:4:1,862
Yeah, so --
(Laughter)


70
0:4:1,862 --> 0:4:6,1
However, sometimes I need to find
a different way to do something


71
0:4:6,1 --> 0:4:7,712
by making adjustments,


72
0:4:7,712 --> 0:4:11,799
and I want to put those things
in the "can do" category.


73
0:4:11,799 --> 0:4:14,803
Kind of like you saw
with the drum earlier.


74
0:4:14,803 --> 0:4:16,512
So here’s a clip


75
0:4:16,512 --> 0:4:18,951
with me playing Spider-Man


76
0:4:18,951 --> 0:4:21,76
with the Foxboro High School 
Marching Band


77
0:4:21,76 --> 0:4:23,864
at halftime a couple of years ago.


78
0:4:23,864 --> 0:4:26,648
(Video)


79
0:4:26,648 --> 0:5:7,115
♫ Spider-Man theme song ♫


80
0:5:7,115 --> 0:5:10,622
(Applause)


81
0:5:10,622 --> 0:5:12,548
Thank you.


82
0:5:12,548 --> 0:5:14,921
All right, all right, so --


83
0:5:14,921 --> 0:5:16,226
That was pretty cool,


84
0:5:16,226 --> 0:5:19,561
and so I was able
to accomplish my dream


85
0:5:19,561 --> 0:5:22,117
of playing snare drum
with the marching band,


86
0:5:22,117 --> 0:5:25,9
as I believe I can do
for all of my dreams.


87
0:5:25,9 --> 0:5:30,167
So hopefully, you can accomplish
your dreams as well, with this outlook.


88
0:5:30,167 --> 0:5:32,382
The next aspect to my philosophy is


89
0:5:32,382 --> 0:5:36,818
that I surround myself
with people I want to be with,


90
0:5:36,818 --> 0:5:38,634
people of high quality.


91
0:5:38,634 --> 0:5:42,68
I’m extremely lucky
to have an amazing family,


92
0:5:42,68 --> 0:5:46,11
who have always supported me
throughout my entire life.


93
0:5:46,11 --> 0:5:48,489
And I’m also really fortunate to have


94
0:5:48,489 --> 0:5:51,498
a really close group of friends 
at school.


95
0:5:51,498 --> 0:5:55,5
Now we’re kind of goofy,
a lot of us are band geeks,


96
0:5:55,5 --> 0:5:57,412
but we really enjoy 
each other’s company,


97
0:5:57,412 --> 0:6:0,434
and we help each other out 
when we need to.


98
0:6:0,434 --> 0:6:4,562
We see each other
for who we are on the inside.


99
0:6:4,562 --> 0:6:6,865
So this is us goofing off a little bit.


100
0:6:6,865 --> 0:6:9,372
So we’re juniors in High School now,


101
0:6:9,372 --> 0:6:15,129
and we can now mentor
younger band members,


102
0:6:15,129 --> 0:6:16,986
as a single collective unit.


103
0:6:16,986 --> 0:6:19,916
What I love about
being in a group like the band,


104
0:6:19,916 --> 0:6:22,834
is that the music
that we make together,


105
0:6:22,834 --> 0:6:28,243
is true, is genuine,
and it supersedes Progeria.


106
0:6:28,243 --> 0:6:29,875
So I don’t have to worry about that


107
0:6:29,875 --> 0:6:33,87
when I’m feeling so good
about making music.


108
0:6:33,87 --> 0:6:36,564
But even having made 
a documentary,


109
0:6:36,564 --> 0:6:38,975
going on TV a couple of times,


110
0:6:38,975 --> 0:6:41,459
I feel like I’m at my highest point


111
0:6:41,459 --> 0:6:45,607
when I’m with the people
that surround me every day.


112
0:6:45,607 --> 0:6:49,5
They provide the real
positive influences in my life,


113
0:6:49,5 --> 0:6:54,699
as I hope I can provide
a positive influence in theirs as well.


114
0:6:54,699 --> 0:6:58,247
(Applause)


115
0:6:58,247 --> 0:6:59,436
Thank you.


116
0:6:59,436 --> 0:7:1,395
So the bottom line here,


117
0:7:1,395 --> 0:7:5,294
is that I hope you appreciate
and love your family,


118
0:7:5,294 --> 0:7:8,453
love your friends,
for you guys, love you Bro’s


119
0:7:8,453 --> 0:7:11,86
and acknowledge your mentors,


120
0:7:11,86 --> 0:7:13,557
and your community,


121
0:7:13,557 --> 0:7:16,654
because they are a very real
aspect of everyday life,


122
0:7:16,654 --> 0:7:20,98
they can make a truly significant,
positive impact.


123
0:7:20,98 --> 0:7:23,663
The third aspect to the philosophy is,


124
0:7:23,663 --> 0:7:25,898
Keep moving forward.


125
0:7:25,898 --> 0:7:29,686
Here’s a quote by a man
you may know, named Walt Disney,


126
0:7:29,686 --> 0:7:31,495
and it’s one of my favorite quotes.


127
0:7:31,495 --> 0:7:34,23
I always try to have something
to look forward to.


128
0:7:34,23 --> 0:7:37,265
Something to strive for
to make my life richer.


129
0:7:37,265 --> 0:7:38,956
It doesn’t have to be big.


130
0:7:38,956 --> 0:7:41,339
It could be anything from


131
0:7:41,339 --> 0:7:43,946
looking forward to
the next comic book to come out,


132
0:7:43,946 --> 0:7:46,467
or going on a large family vacation,


133
0:7:46,467 --> 0:7:48,736
or hanging out with my friends,


134
0:7:48,736 --> 0:7:51,691
to going to the next
High School football game.


135
0:7:51,691 --> 0:7:55,13
However, all of these things
keep me focused,


136
0:7:55,13 --> 0:7:57,851
and know that there’s
a bright future ahead,


137
0:7:57,851 --> 0:8:2,287
and may get me through
some difficult times that I may be having.


138
0:8:2,287 --> 0:8:7,795
Now this mentality includes staying
in a forward thinking state of mind.


139
0:8:7,795 --> 0:8:11,389
I try hard not to waste energy
feeling badly for myself,


140
0:8:11,389 --> 0:8:14,871
because when I do,
I get stuck in a paradox,


141
0:8:14,871 --> 0:8:19,454
where there’s no room for 
any happiness or any other emotion.


142
0:8:19,454 --> 0:8:23,15
Now, it’s not that I ignore
when I’m feeling badly,


143
0:8:23,15 --> 0:8:24,897
I kind of accept it,


144
0:8:24,897 --> 0:8:28,273
I let it in, 
so that I can acknowledge it,


145
0:8:28,273 --> 0:8:31,775
and do what I need to do 
to move past it.


146
0:8:31,775 --> 0:8:35,81
When I was younger,
I wanted to be an engineer.


147
0:8:35,81 --> 0:8:36,995
I wanted to be an inventor,


148
0:8:36,995 --> 0:8:40,9
who would catapult the world
into a better future.


149
0:8:40,9 --> 0:8:42,184
Maybe this came 
from my love of Legos,


150
0:8:42,184 --> 0:8:44,502
and the freedom of expression 
that I felt


151
0:8:44,502 --> 0:8:47,814
when I was building with them.


152
0:8:47,814 --> 0:8:53,489
And this was also derived
from my family and my mentors,


153
0:8:53,489 --> 0:8:57,985
who always make me feel whole,
and good about myself.


154
0:8:57,985 --> 0:9:1,133
Now today my ambitions
have changed a little bit,


155
0:9:1,133 --> 0:9:3,609
I’d like to go into the field of Biology,


156
0:9:3,609 --> 0:9:7,948
maybe cell biology, or genetics,


157
0:9:7,948 --> 0:9:12,417
or biochemistry, or really anything.


158
0:9:12,417 --> 0:9:15,698
This is a friend of mine,
who I look up to,


159
0:9:15,698 --> 0:9:19,252
Francis Collins, the director of the NIH,


160
0:9:19,252 --> 0:9:22,67
and this is us at TEDMED last year,
chatting away.


161
0:9:22,67 --> 0:9:26,208
I feel that no matter what
I choose to become,


162
0:9:26,208 --> 0:9:29,521
I believe that I can change the world.


163
0:9:29,521 --> 0:9:34,417
And as I’m striving to change the world,
I will be happy.


164
0:9:34,417 --> 0:9:36,562
About four years ago,


165
0:9:36,562 --> 0:9:39,247
HBO began to film a documentary


166
0:9:39,247 --> 0:9:42,282
about my family and me
called “Life According to Sam”.


167
0:9:42,282 --> 0:9:46,285
That was a pretty great experience,
but it was also four years ago.


168
0:9:46,285 --> 0:9:49,761
And like anyone, my views
on many things have changed,


169
0:9:49,761 --> 0:9:54,165
and hopefully matured,
like my potential career choice.


170
0:9:54,165 --> 0:9:58,798
However, some things have stayed 
the same throughout that time.


171
0:9:58,798 --> 0:10:2,679
Like my mentality,
and philosophy towards life.


172
0:10:2,679 --> 0:10:4,73
So I would like to show you


173
0:10:4,73 --> 0:10:7,921
a clip of my younger self from the film,


174
0:10:7,921 --> 0:10:11,492
that I feel embodies that philosophy.


175
0:10:11,492 --> 0:10:12,659
(Video)


176
0:10:12,659 --> 0:10:16,314
I know more about it genetically.


177
0:10:16,314 --> 0:10:19,857
So it’s less of an embodiment now.


178
0:10:19,857 --> 0:10:21,335
It used to be like


179
0:10:21,335 --> 0:10:24,135
this thing that prevents me
from doing all this stuff,


180
0:10:24,135 --> 0:10:26,669
that causes other kids to die,


181
0:10:26,669 --> 0:10:29,639
that causes everybody 
to be stressed,


182
0:10:29,639 --> 0:10:35,276
and now
it’s a protein that is abnormal,


183
0:10:35,276 --> 0:10:40,465
that weakens the structure of cells.


184
0:10:40,465 --> 0:10:42,76
So,


185
0:10:42,76 --> 0:10:45,458
and it takes a burden
off of me because now


186
0:10:45,458 --> 0:10:48,21
I don’t have to think about


187
0:10:48,21 --> 0:10:55,905
Progeria as an entity.


188
0:10:55,905 --> 0:10:57,507
Okay, pretty good, huh?


189
0:10:57,507 --> 0:11:1,596
(Applause)


190
0:11:1,596 --> 0:11:2,671
Thank you.


191
0:11:2,671 --> 0:11:5,99
So, as you can see I’ve been
thinking this way for many years.


192
0:11:5,99 --> 0:11:10,435
But I’d never really had to apply
all of these aspects of my philosophy


193
0:11:10,435 --> 0:11:14,176
to the test at one time, 
until last January.


194
0:11:14,176 --> 0:11:19,1
I was pretty sick, I had a chest cold,
and I was in the hospital for a few days,


195
0:11:19,1 --> 0:11:23,6
and I was secluded from 
all of the aspects of my life that I felt


196
0:11:23,6 --> 0:11:25,124
made me, me,


197
0:11:25,124 --> 0:11:27,952
that kind of gave me my identity.


198
0:11:27,952 --> 0:11:31,29
But knowing
that I was going to get better,


199
0:11:31,29 --> 0:11:34,9
and looking forward to a time
that I would feel good again,


200
0:11:34,9 --> 0:11:36,659
helped me to keep moving forward.


201
0:11:36,659 --> 0:11:39,211
And sometimes I had to be brave,


202
0:11:39,211 --> 0:11:41,3
and it wasn’t always easy.


203
0:11:41,3 --> 0:11:42,617
Sometimes I faltered,


204
0:11:42,617 --> 0:11:44,363
I had bad days,


205
0:11:44,363 --> 0:11:47,857
but I realized that being brave
isn’t supposed to be easy.


206
0:11:47,857 --> 0:11:51,957
And for me, I feel it’s the key way
to keep moving forward.


207
0:11:51,957 --> 0:11:54,181
So, all in all,


208
0:11:54,181 --> 0:11:57,725
I don’t waste energy
feeling bad for myself.


209
0:11:57,725 --> 0:12:1,4
I surround myself with people
that I want to be with,


210
0:12:1,4 --> 0:12:3,317
and I keep moving forward.


211
0:12:3,317 --> 0:12:6,689
So with this philosophy,
I hope that all of you,


212
0:12:6,689 --> 0:12:8,766
regardless of your obstacles,


213
0:12:8,766 --> 0:12:11,613
can have a very happy life as well.


214
0:12:11,613 --> 0:12:13,131
Oh, wait, hang on a second,


215
0:12:13,131 --> 0:12:15,619
one more piece of advice –-


216
0:12:15,619 --> 0:12:17,219
(Laughter)


217
0:12:17,219 --> 0:12:19,709
Never miss a party if you can help it.


218
0:12:19,709 --> 0:12:22,85
My school’s homecoming dance
is tomorrow night,


219
0:12:22,85 --> 0:12:24,169
and I will be there.


220
0:12:24,169 --> 0:12:25,641
Thank you very much.


221
0:12:25,641 --> 0:14:25,641
(Applause)
