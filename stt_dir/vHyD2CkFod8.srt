STANLEY: Hello. I'm Benjamen T. Stanley. I
am a local chef from Chicago. My day job--I'm


3
0:0:28,13 --> 0:0:29,93
a research development chef for a small flavoring
company called Bell Flavors and Fragrances.


4
0:0:29,93 --> 0:0:32,239
It's based on the Northbrook. But when I come
home at night, I like to experiment. I like


5
0:0:32,239 --> 0:0:42,3
to do a lot of fun things. I like to kind
of teach myself a lot of different things.


6
0:0:42,3 --> 0:0:56,879
So I'm basically going to do a run down on
fermentation and my personal experiences with


7
0:0:56,879 --> 0:0:58,5
it, working with a--kind of learning how to
do things myself and think different fermented


8
0:0:58,5 --> 0:1:0,93
products. And fermented food is just--it's
one of those products that a lot of people


9
0:1:0,93 --> 0:1:6,659
don't really understand the process for, but
they loved them. Over, I think it's 1/3 of


10
0:1:6,659 --> 0:1:11,119
the food consumers is fermented like anything
from soy sauce, tea, chocolate, coffee, sauerkraut,


11
0:1:11,119 --> 0:1:19,97
kimchi, any kind of cheese. We consume over
15 million tons of cheese annually as a culture.


12
0:1:19,97 --> 0:1:27,229
Over 22 million gallons of beer and other
fermented liquors like, you know, wine, any


13
0:1:27,229 --> 0:1:34,749
kind of bacchus, stuff like that. And the
basic understanding of why these things happen


14
0:1:34,749 --> 0:1:43,999
is generally unknown to the public. By definition,
fermentation is an anaerobic process. So basically,


15
0:1:43,999 --> 0:1:54,7
it's the conversion of sugar or some kind
of carbohydrate plus some kind of bacteria


16
0:1:54,7 --> 0:2:3,63
and it converts it into alcohol or combine
with energy along with other enzymes, other,


17
0:2:3,63 --> 0:2:10,86
you know, various chemicals. In a food sense,
it doesn't have to be anaerobic. It can also


18
0:2:10,86 --> 0:2:16,94
be aerobic. So large processing situations,
we'll add air, we'll add different temperatures,


19
0:2:16,94 --> 0:2:24,12
we'll kind of control the conditions of the
way things ferment help, kind of facilitate


20
0:2:24,12 --> 0:2:31,409
that fermentation to help the growth of organisms,
to help them thrive, to help them feed. So


21
0:2:31,409 --> 0:2:37,2
this is the chemical reaction. It looks pretty
difficult. It looks kind of weird. Basically,


22
0:2:37,2 --> 0:2:43,67
sugar--any kind of sugar, glucose, fructose,
sucrose. You add it to your microbial agent


23
0:2:43,67 --> 0:2:50,4
like yeasts, molds, other kind of bacteria
and they release alcohol, just basic ethanol,


24
0:2:50,4 --> 0:2:56,99
carbon dioxide and some kind of energy unit
whether it be heat, whether at the--some kind


25
0:2:56,99 --> 0:3:6,319
of different bi-product, CO2 and stuff like
that. Why this is an important process? Fermentation


26
0:3:6,319 --> 0:3:8,45
is probably one of the oldest methods of preservation.
There's quite a few different methods that


27
0:3:8,45 --> 0:3:18,34
are tried and true. First one is salting.
What salt does is it basically draws moisture


28
0:3:18,34 --> 0:3:24,409
out of your products and also inhibits microbial
growth. So it helps inhibit, you know, different


29
0:3:24,409 --> 0:3:32,39
organisms from growing and stuff like that.
But it's usually the fungicidal, spores, stuff


30
0:3:32,39 --> 0:3:36,62
like that, that it helps to prevent. So what
you're doing is the salt will pull the moisture


31
0:3:36,62 --> 0:3:38,689
out. It'll pull out the water which is, you
know, breeding ground for a lot of different


32
0:3:38,689 --> 0:3:47,379
organisms, stuff like that. And then it will
create this boundary between the products


33
0:3:47,379 --> 0:3:59,42
and the air. So the different organisms can't
penetrate to that salt solution. Another one


34
0:3:59,42 --> 0:4:3,73
is smoking--same idea. The smoke is antimicrobial.
You're basically enveloping a product in smoke,


35
0:4:3,73 --> 0:4:8,359
you're creating this kind of crust that goes
over your product and it's helping keep the


36
0:4:8,359 --> 0:4:15,19
air in getting into your product, it's helping
keep those organisms from fermenting the product.


37
0:4:15,19 --> 0:4:21,17
And then the other one is drying or dehydrating.
Again, you're pulling the moisture out and


38
0:4:21,17 --> 0:4:30,2
moisture is what helps facilitate this growth.
Fermentation is involved in a lot of other


39
0:4:30,2 --> 0:4:35,49
processes, kind of like ethanol preservation
where the use of alcohol is used to inhibit


40
0:4:35,49 --> 0:4:40,68
growth. The high levels of alcohol would kill
organisms, as well as lactic acid preservation


41
0:4:40,68 --> 0:4:47,2
which is what you see in cheese, the high
acid levels, the same with vinegar, pickling.


42
0:4:47,2 --> 0:4:56,49
The high acid levels will only permit certain
organisms to grow but not others. Fermenting


43
0:4:56,49 --> 0:5:2,13
a product--there's two different kinds of
techniques we used to get the process going


44
0:5:2,13 --> 0:5:9,319
to get it kind of started, facilitated, inoculated,
you might say. The first one is wild fermentation


45
0:5:9,319 --> 0:5:13,0
which basically just leaving a product out,
exposing it to air, exposing it to anything


46
0:5:13,0 --> 0:5:20,199
that's flying around the room. A lot of yeasts
are present in everyday flowers, on the outside


47
0:5:20,199 --> 0:5:26,25
are fruits and vegetables, an outer peel.
Anything that's really high in sugar, it will


48
0:5:26,25 --> 0:5:36,6
attract some kind of organism to come and
feed on. The other way is to have human input.


49
0:5:36,6 --> 0:5:40,72
Basically, human input provides a more controlled
environment that we can change and affect


50
0:5:40,72 --> 0:5:46,6
the final outcome of our product. So, what
they'll do is they'll actually develop a certain


51
0:5:46,6 --> 0:5:52,289
product, let's say, yogurt. You know, they
have this yogurt that they tried it through.


52
0:5:52,289 --> 0:5:56,8
They like the way it taste. What they can
do is take their original base, [INDISTINCT]


53
0:5:56,8 --> 0:6:2,69
heat it to kill all the organisms that are
in there and then re-introduced that the yogurt


54
0:6:2,69 --> 0:6:8,83
had passed the flavor and the consistency
that they want to that heated base that basically


55
0:6:8,83 --> 0:6:13,27
starts out with a clean pallet and only incorporates
the organisms that they wanted. And they do


56
0:6:13,27 --> 0:6:17,87
the same method for making the yogurt that
will come out, for the most part, the exact


57
0:6:17,87 --> 0:6:27,509
same way as the original one as they do follow
the same process. Wild fermentation is a little


58
0:6:27,509 --> 0:6:31,99
bit more unreliable. There's a lot of different
things in the area that contribute to it,


59
0:6:31,99 --> 0:6:36,169
but that also will develop the most interesting
flavors. Stuff like sourdough breads. You


60
0:6:36,169 --> 0:6:39,59
can make a sourdough bread in San Francisco
and it'll taste completely different than


61
0:6:39,59 --> 0:6:45,2
the sourdough bread in Chicago because of
the temperature or the environment, different


62
0:6:45,2 --> 0:7:5,12
yeast that are on the air, stuff like that.
Other factors in the end-product, we have


63
0:7:5,12 --> 0:7:13,61
temperature, environment, season, humidity,
your experimentation basically. What your


64
0:7:13,61 --> 0:7:22,3
type of processes and the flow at how things
get done. Ms. Jo over here just kind of builds


65
0:7:22,3 --> 0:7:35,21
closer a little bit, to each one in wine making
clarification. If you take out some of the


66
0:7:35,21 --> 0:7:47,3
salads in your product, it will affect the
final fermentation of the product and then


67
0:7:47,3 --> 0:8:6,68
you'll have less [INDISTINCT], less yeast
because the yeast kind of stay on the sides


68
0:8:6,68 --> 0:8:21,59
on the grapes till you pull the skins out,
you're actually pulling out some of the actual


69
0:8:21,59 --> 0:8:31,46
organisms that are doing the fermentation.
Temperature shock, whether that organism has


70
0:8:31,46 --> 0:8:40,39
the right temperature to grow, usually about
bio-temperature, the perfect temperature for


71
0:8:40,39 --> 0:8:53,89
the organisms to dry. If you make it go really
cold, they won't kill them, but they'll kind


72
0:8:53,89 --> 0:9:7,38
of go asleep. They kind of won't do anything
or get lazy. They won't actually ferment anything.


73
0:9:7,38 --> 0:9:22,649
You raise it up too high, you'll kill them
and then they can't do anything. Other minerals,


74
0:9:22,649 --> 0:9:34,68
other things that can help facilitate the
growth whether the oxygen, different minerals,


75
0:9:34,68 --> 0:9:50,13
different kinds of salt, some kind of phosphate
or nitrate, and as well as, you know, the


76
0:9:50,13 --> 0:9:58,94
microbiological environment whether they're
yeasts and molds and everything are in the


77
0:9:58,94 --> 0:10:9,18
surrounding area whether what you're trying
to inoculate with is able to compete with


78
0:10:9,18 --> 0:10:27,68
what's already in the air. Traces and history,
I guess that is one of the oldest processes


79
0:10:27,68 --> 0:10:44,0
where preserving foods and it starts almost
as old as 12 to 20--12,000 years ago. Mead


80
0:10:44,0 --> 0:10:52,81
was one of the first products that originated
and it's basically just a fermented honey


81
0:10:52,81 --> 0:10:59,42
drink. Honey collecting as early as 12,000
years ago, in areas like Egypt and Samarian


82
0:10:59,42 --> 0:11:6,55
areas and for most part, a lot of these things
were discovered by accident. Honey, for example,


83
0:11:6,55 --> 0:11:16,2
is high in sugar so, you know, it is an attractant
for these yeasts and molds and other things.


84
0:11:16,2 --> 0:11:24,399
They will collect the honey. They mix it with
water and make a drink and they didn't have


85
0:11:24,399 --> 0:11:35,25
refrigeration so they just let it sit out.
While as it sit out, they started to notice,


86
0:11:35,25 --> 0:11:49,62
you know, little things, changes going on
to it, they started to notice bubbles come


87
0:11:49,62 --> 0:12:2,529
out, they started to see discoloration, different
things growing out. And this visual queue


88
0:12:2,529 --> 0:12:18,75
is originally how fermentation happened. Just
seeing a bout of change and tasting it as


89
0:12:18,75 --> 0:12:28,35
it changed, to kind of, you know, see the
differences and see whether they liked it


90
0:12:28,35 --> 0:12:37,57
or not. Soy sauce dates back to over 2,500
years ago. Until the 17th century, with the


91
0:12:37,57 --> 0:12:48,29
creation of the microscope, it was generally
unknown why these things happened. People


92
0:12:48,29 --> 0:13:0,22
just started doing it in their homes, in their
basements and they found that it tasted good


93
0:13:0,22 --> 0:13:8,85
and they just went off with that and started
making chesses and started making alcohols.


94
0:13:8,85 --> 0:13:18,31
They don't really understand why. And when
the microscope was created, they started to


95
0:13:18,31 --> 0:13:24,88
notice these little organisms, different things
inside of the foods. Well, it's science and


96
0:13:24,88 --> 0:13:38,7
at the time, it was such a new concept that
it was generally disregarded. A lot of scientists


97
0:13:38,7 --> 0:13:45,67
kind of refused the fact that this could even
happen, that there were some kind of small


98
0:13:45,67 --> 0:13:56,8
living organisms and the things that they're
eating and they just--they didn't even believe


99
0:13:56,8 --> 0:14:11,519
it and they completely rejected it outright.
It wasn't even until about the 19th to 20th


100
0:14:11,519 --> 0:14:23,75
century when Louis Pasteur actually decided
to make this connection between what was growing


101
0:14:23,75 --> 0:14:39,199
and the changes that were done. The way that
he came upon this process was that a company


102
0:14:39,199 --> 0:14:54,509
that was a making a beet juice alcohol was
having a lot of variations in his product.


103
0:14:54,509 --> 0:15:13,85
And he didn't understand why. He'd been making
it the same way for a number of years and


104
0:15:13,85 --> 0:15:28,1
it was just coming out different every single
time he was making it, it was very unreliable,


105
0:15:28,1 --> 0:15:49,49
it was affecting his business. So he gave
it to the chemist, Louis Pasteur to test stuff.


106
0:15:49,49 --> 0:16:3,99
Well, upon looking at the microscope, he noticed
that from older samples of the alcohol versus


107
0:16:3,99 --> 0:16:11,55
newer ones, there were different things, different
organisms, different small bacteria that were


108
0:16:11,55 --> 0:16:30,259
present. So he actually came up with a method
of pasteurization which we all know is just


109
0:16:30,259 --> 0:16:38,5
heating a product to kill that microflora
and then you reintroduced it with the specific


110
0:16:38,5 --> 0:16:52,44
starter that you wanted. Some benefits of
fermentation; preservation, it preserves not


111
0:16:52,44 --> 0:17:0,97
only the product itself but it also preserves
nutrients. It will actually increase the way


112
0:17:0,97 --> 0:17:14,41
that the body--the body can kind of use some
of the nutrients especially like vitamin B,


113
0:17:14,41 --> 0:17:27,66
vitamin C, calcium. It prevents them from
being destroyed by sitting in for a long period


114
0:17:27,66 --> 0:17:44,8
of time. It kind of prevents the degradation
of the product itself. The digestive aide,


115
0:17:44,8 --> 0:17:56,4
a lot of the products if they are not heated,
they still have these live cultures and it


116
0:17:56,4 --> 0:18:12,55
still has its microflora and because this
microflora can survive very acidic environments,


117
0:18:12,55 --> 0:18:30,76
it still is highly active in your intestinal
tract, in your body system. So as you go through


118
0:18:30,76 --> 0:18:56,54
your system and often kind of make a small
home in your intestinal tract, it will actually


119
0:18:56,54 --> 0:19:12,47
help you digest foods, it will help you absorb
nutrients better, it will help you absorb


120
0:19:12,47 --> 0:19:24,8
different nutrients that your body normally
can't breakdown, a lot of proteins, a lot


121
0:19:24,8 --> 0:19:37,72
of amino acids that your body has a really
hard time breaking down. The organisms will


122
0:19:37,72 --> 0:19:44,52
do the work for you. Flavor development, there's
a specific chemical reaction that happens


123
0:19:44,52 --> 0:20:1,37
when, you know, you're doing this fermentation
and you're developing a lot of different flavors


124
0:20:1,37 --> 0:20:12,9
through the use of enzymes, through the use
of creating acids and alcohols. It has antioxidant


125
0:20:12,9 --> 0:20:22,31
properties that actually opens up that antioxidants
that your body can use them a little bit better.


126
0:20:22,31 --> 0:20:35,37
It's a fortifier. Like I said, it creates
vitamin B. It removes toxins. The process


127
0:20:35,37 --> 0:20:46,31
of fermentation is used for ingredients like
coffee. When coffee is grown, it has a cherry


128
0:20:46,31 --> 0:20:55,58
on the outside of it, you pick the cherry
and let it sit out so that fruit can ripen,


129
0:20:55,58 --> 0:21:11,48
kind of fall off and then you take the beans
from it. And that helps removes some of the


130
0:21:11,48 --> 0:21:27,6
toxins that are associated with the cherry.
Same is true with like certain types of cassava.


131
0:21:27,6 --> 0:21:47,37
In Africa, they have to take cassava and soak
it in water to help pull that cyanide that


132
0:21:47,37 --> 0:21:57,26
is present in the vegetable out. Once they're
soaked in the water, these toxins come out


133
0:21:57,26 --> 0:22:13,63
and they can actually cook the cassava and
eat it. Again, you know, there's a processing


134
0:22:13,63 --> 0:22:31,4
aide, tea is another example, when they pull
the leaves, they let them sit out to dry and


135
0:22:31,4 --> 0:22:49,63
ferment. This allows the tea to develop more
flavor, to have less moisture in it, lasts


136
0:22:49,63 --> 0:23:1,54
longer. And now I'm going to go over some
specific examples. Vegetable ferments. They're


137
0:23:1,54 --> 0:23:12,65
basically usually using a salt brine to help
protect the vegetables from rotting. The salt


138
0:23:12,65 --> 0:23:20,25
will pull the moisture out of the vegetable
and actually create its own shell for the


139
0:23:20,25 --> 0:23:39,92
vegetable. Multiple changes occur in one thing.
I use the example of sauerkraut. When you


140
0:23:39,92 --> 0:23:58,34
first start sauerkraut, you add salt to your
cabbage, the salt will pull the moisture out,


141
0:23:58,34 --> 0:24:16,27
it will create this barrier for your sauerkraut
and then it will only allow certain organisms


142
0:24:16,27 --> 0:24:16,48
to grow. You're using just straight water
and salt, only the coliform can grow and once


143
0:24:16,48 --> 0:24:26,98
the coliform grows, it proliferates, it feeds,
it will start taking the carbohydrates from


144
0:24:26,98 --> 0:24:38,31
the cabbage, you know, it will output a certain
level of acid. Once the acid starts to get


145
0:24:38,31 --> 0:24:49,2
too high, it actually diminishes, you know,
the coliform that's in the system and then


146
0:24:49,2 --> 0:24:51,46
it will leave the kind of stuff will come
in and started feeding on that acid. Again,


147
0:24:51,46 --> 0:24:59,11
it goes up, it proliferates, and it starts
to die down and then finally, lactobacillus


148
0:24:59,11 --> 0:25:17,9
which is one of the most common, comes in
and it will start to create lactic acid which


149
0:25:17,9 --> 0:25:38,11
is that sharp--kind of cheesy sensation that
you get from a lot of products like cheese,


150
0:25:38,11 --> 0:25:56,71
sauerkraut, kimchi. This is a basic, a very
traditional prop for making sauerkraut. Basically,


151
0:25:56,71 --> 0:26:1,18
what you do is you take your salted cabbage
which can be--sauerkraut can be anything.


152
0:26:1,18 --> 0:26:9,74
Any kind of vegetable can be made into sauerkraut.
You take your vegetable and you mix it with


153
0:26:9,74 --> 0:26:17,54
salt, spices, you know, you use onions, apples,
bay leaves, peppercorns, stuff like that.


154
0:26:17,54 --> 0:26:27,8
You mixed it with the salt and now what you're
going to do is you're going to take a very,


155
0:26:27,8 --> 0:26:41,51
very heavy weight, push it on top of those
vegetables. What the weight does is it helps


156
0:26:41,51 --> 0:26:59,43
to push the moisture out of the vegetables
and leave it at the bottom. If you want this


157
0:26:59,43 --> 0:27:8,6
to be an anaerobic environment so that air
doesn't affect how you think to mix as you


158
0:27:8,6 --> 0:27:12,9
want the molds, you want the actual sauerkraut
to develop anaerobic environment. So once


159
0:27:12,9 --> 0:27:23,46
you weigh it, all you got to do is put a little
bit of salt water around the room of the kraut.


160
0:27:23,46 --> 0:27:38,73
And what the salt water does is, again, helps
keep the microbes into entering into your


161
0:27:38,73 --> 0:27:57,38
kraut and [INDISTINCT]. And you let it sit
for anywhere from one week to up to a year


162
0:27:57,38 --> 0:28:10,39
when that sit, unrefrigerated, you want to
leave it at the ideal temperature for growth


163
0:28:10,39 --> 0:28:32,97
which is anywhere between 85 and 100 degrees.
It's kind of dark, you can't really see it,


164
0:28:32,97 --> 0:28:50,76
but this is an example of sauerkraut that
I made today that you guys are going to be


165
0:28:50,76 --> 0:29:1,86
trying. It's basically just white cabbage,
it's got some onions and apples, some different


166
0:29:1,86 --> 0:29:13,15
spices and stuff like that. And this is–-I
put in the bowl added salt to it, you generally


167
0:29:13,15 --> 0:29:20,5
add about 5% to 10% solution of salt to your
sauerkraut. And the salt will determine how


168
0:29:20,5 --> 0:29:37,27
long it sits for. If you get more salt, then
you will take your sauerkraut and age it for


169
0:29:37,27 --> 0:29:50,93
a longer amount of time at a lower temperature.
If you get less salt, then you're going to


170
0:29:50,93 --> 0:29:56,43
age it for a shorter amount of time at a higher
temperature. Kimchi, it's one of the most


171
0:29:56,43 --> 0:30:11,51
popular condiments of Korea. It said that,
every Korean on an individual basis consumes


172
0:30:11,51 --> 0:30:18,15
about a quarter pound of kimchi a day which
really adds up by the end of the year. It's


173
0:30:18,15 --> 0:30:20,51
a very, very artisanal product. It's made
by almost every family, for the family. It's


174
0:30:20,51 --> 0:30:25,25
not really something that you go out and buy
as often, that is traditionally nowadays with


175
0:30:25,25 --> 0:30:26,68
conveniences and stuff like that, you can
get it mass produced. But, usually it was


176
0:30:26,68 --> 0:30:32,93
something that was a very home orientated
part of the culture. They come home, they


177
0:30:32,93 --> 0:30:34,73
harvest their own vegetables, they make the
kimchi out of whatever vegetables they had


178
0:30:34,73 --> 0:30:40,11
available. They mixed it with salt and spices
and generally, chili pepper is used, they


179
0:30:40,11 --> 0:30:41,7
use seafood, they use anything. The big difference
between kimchi and sauerkraut is that when


180
0:30:41,7 --> 0:30:42,84
you make kimchi, you soaked your vegetables
ahead of time in salt water. What this does


181
0:30:42,84 --> 0:30:44,26
is it pulls the moisture out, fuse the salt
into the vegetables and it also kind of helps


182
0:30:44,26 --> 0:30:44,9
keep the crisp texture of that kimchi. So
this is soaking some cabbage to make it for


183
0:30:44,9 --> 0:30:45,59
the kimchi. Again, this is about a 5% salt
solution. Once you're done soaking it, you


184
0:30:45,59 --> 0:30:46,24
pull out, chopped it, mix it with various
vegetables. I use radish, carrot, a couple


185
0:30:46,24 --> 0:30:46,85
of different kinds of greens, you generally
used ginger, garlic, red pepper. Then you're


186
0:30:46,85 --> 0:30:46,97
going to take it and put it in--I use--this
is very similar to the sauerkraut prop. So


187
0:30:46,97 --> 0:30:50,79
you can do it at home and just put it in any
kind of container. Usually you want to use


188
0:30:50,79 --> 0:30:53,7
a kind of hard plastic. You don't want to
use metal because the metal will actually


189
0:30:53,7 --> 0:30:56,39
react to the acids and kind of create a teeny
taste your food. So any kind of plastic, any


190
0:30:56,39 --> 0:31:12,87
kind of food crate--usually the big white
buckets that you find as long as it's never


191
0:31:12,87 --> 0:31:14,45
been used is a good option. Now what you're
going to do is you're going to put a weight


192
0:31:14,45 --> 0:31:14,6
on top to bring that moisture level to help
protect your vegetables. This is an example


193
0:31:14,6 --> 0:31:14,82
of a fruit kimchi. They are made the exact
same style. Again, you take your fruit, cut


194
0:31:14,82 --> 0:31:14,98
them off and salt them. If you can't soak
them, brine them if you want, but it's not


195
0:31:14,98 --> 0:31:15,27
necessary. And you got to take them--weigh
them down. Bean ferments, a lot of people


196
0:31:15,27 --> 0:31:16,39
are familiar with soy sauce and miso, tempeh
[INDISTINCT] nattos which is a Japanese [INDISTINCT]


197
0:31:16,39 --> 0:31:23,88
fermented with whole soy beans. Because of
the protein content, they are very difficult


198
0:31:23,88 --> 0:31:27,68
for the human body to digest. So we use the
process of fermentation to help beak down


199
0:31:27,68 --> 0:31:29,25
these proteins so that they're are easily
digested by the body. This is kind of a simple


200
0:31:29,25 --> 0:31:36,5
diagram of how soy sauce is made. Basically,
you take your ingredients, the soybean, wheat,


201
0:31:36,5 --> 0:31:39,8
and some kind of mold that's already been
established from a different process. Usually,


202
0:31:39,8 --> 0:31:44,42
the same molds that they use for making rice
wine, sake is also as present in soy sauce.


203
0:31:44,42 --> 0:31:48,57
What we'll do is put in an open air container
and let proliferate, kind of grow and then


204
0:31:48,57 --> 0:31:54,13
after they do that, take it, put it in a container,
let it sit for a specific time temperature


205
0:31:54,13 --> 0:32:0,27
for about six months. After it sits for a
couple of months, they'll take it, they'll


206
0:32:0,27 --> 0:32:5,4
press it to get all the liquid out, strain
it, that's how you have soy sauce. That's


207
0:32:5,4 --> 0:32:6,32
a nationally fermented soy sauce. They also
have a method which is chemically induced


208
0:32:6,32 --> 0:32:6,9
but much quicker. It usually takes about a
couple of hours, but they'll take soy beans


209
0:32:6,9 --> 0:32:8,1
and they'll add hydrochloric acid to it. This
hydrolyses the vegetables and then it creates


210
0:32:8,1 --> 0:32:15,56
that kind of meaty taste to it. You'll notice
that taste is very chemically, it doesn't


211
0:32:15,56 --> 0:32:19,53
taste sweet. There's a lot of flavors in that--kind
of just don't exist when you have this chemically


212
0:32:19,53 --> 0:32:21,25
made soy sauce. Tempeh is one of the more
interesting products. Yes?


213
0:32:21,25 --> 0:32:22,83
>> Do you have any idea about the Kikkoman
fermented soy sauce, everybody has the stories


214
0:32:22,83 --> 0:32:23,8
about Kikkoman?
>> STANLEY: Kikkoman is actually one of the


215
0:32:23,8 --> 0:32:24,62
few that are anturally fermented.
>> Okay.


216
0:32:24,62 --> 0:32:26,55
>> STANLEY: A lot of the--a lot of the stuff
you buy in the store naturally brewed. A lot


217
0:32:26,55 --> 0:32:30,27
of the stuff that's in more industrious scale,
the stuff that you buy, you're processing


218
0:32:30,27 --> 0:32:30,37
stuff like that, is not.
>> Okay.


219
0:32:30,37 --> 0:32:30,58
>> STANLEY: Tempeh is another [INDISTINCT]
ferment which is basically cooked soy beans


220
0:32:30,58 --> 0:32:32,73
that are allowed to cool. They have starter
added to it and they sit in an open air environment.


221
0:32:32,73 --> 0:32:36,64
What happens is that the starter will proliferate
with the addition of air, warmth and it will


222
0:32:36,64 --> 0:32:41,23
start to spread, you know, create this kind
of mold. What the mold will do is it will


223
0:32:41,23 --> 0:32:43,45
actually take all the soy beans and connect
them. Mold will grow across the entire Tempeh


224
0:32:43,45 --> 0:32:45,84
and actually pull it together to be this firm
brick. And actually, it will develop very


225
0:32:45,84 --> 0:32:47,4
earthy and kind of mushroom taste to it that
are often desirable for vegetarian community


226
0:32:47,4 --> 0:32:52,71
because it has that texture to it and it can
absorb a lot of flavor, and it has that kind


227
0:32:52,71 --> 0:32:55,86
of meaty texture to it. Dairy ferments, lactobacilli
which is the common bacteria that are in dairy


228
0:32:55,86 --> 0:32:57,69
ferments. They eat the lactose present in
the dairy and they turn into lactic acid.


229
0:32:57,69 --> 0:32:57,71
Lactose is basically an ingredient that's
in most dairy that a lot of humans have a


230
0:32:57,71 --> 0:32:57,72
hard time digesting because we do not have
the enzyme that breaks down this lactose.


231
0:32:57,72 --> 0:32:57,74
So, that's why if you're lactose intolerant,
a lot of people that are lactose intolerant


232
0:32:57,74 --> 0:32:57,76
will find that if they eat an aged cheese
or if they eat a yogurt that's heavily fermented,


233
0:32:57,76 --> 0:32:57,78
it doesn't bother them as much that's because
the fermentation--the lactobacilli are actually


234
0:32:57,78 --> 0:32:57,79
taking those enzymes that you can't process
and do it for you. Some examples; buttermilk,


235
0:32:57,79 --> 0:32:57,81
yogurt, butter, all sorts of cheeses, kefir
which is another fermented yogurt product.


236
0:32:57,81 --> 0:32:57,82
Yogurt, more so now than previously, starting
to be promoted with having probiotics; as


237
0:32:57,82 --> 0:32:57,84
having these organisms in it that are helping
your digestive tract or helping you process


238
0:32:57,84 --> 0:32:57,86
your food, they're helping you speed up your
metabolism. This is not a new concept; this


239
0:32:57,86 --> 0:32:57,87
has been around for thousands of years. It
actually went away with the invention of pasteurization


240
0:32:57,87 --> 0:32:57,89
because people were afraid of these things
that were in their food, they're afraid that


241
0:32:57,89 --> 0:32:57,91
they're going to make them sick. If you take
yogurt and you just make it normally, you


242
0:32:57,91 --> 0:32:57,92
actually have these probiotics, so they have
these digestive enzymes. As you pasteurize


243
0:32:57,92 --> 0:32:57,94
it, you're killing all those things; or, what
that'll do is add the starters to it while


244
0:32:57,94 --> 0:33:0,99
turning the yogurt, heat it after it's turned
the yogurt to kill everything to make it safer


245
0:33:0,99 --> 0:33:1,21
human consumption as you know, safe as in--meaning
not exactly safer but more well received by


246
0:33:1,21 --> 0:33:1,56
the public. When you're making yogurt, you
only need to add a little bit of the starter


247
0:33:1,56 --> 0:33:2,24
to get started. If you add too much or actually
crowd everything, you know, it will cause


248
0:33:2,24 --> 0:33:2,99
less of the bacteria to grow but more of the
acid remains. You have a very, very sour astringent


249
0:33:2,99 --> 0:33:3,62
yogurt. It's a relatively quick product to
make; it only takes about eight to 12 hours


250
0:33:3,62 --> 0:33:4,6
depending on how long you sit at the temperature
where the bacteria proliferate at, it will


251
0:33:4,6 --> 0:33:4,67
affect how sour the product is. So, generally
what you do is you heat your yogurt up, this


252
0:33:4,67 --> 0:33:4,71
is me heating the yogurt up. Heat up to about
180 degrees first, heat them out, sorry, start


253
0:33:4,71 --> 0:33:4,76
out with the milk base. You can choose how
much fat is in your milk base you're getting.


254
0:33:4,76 --> 0:33:4,81
A thinner yogurt will have less fat, very
thick yogurt will be high in fat; will go


255
0:33:4,81 --> 0:33:5,2
up to 40% fat. Still have correct fermentation
of yogurt. Add again by heating up the product


256
0:33:5,2 --> 0:33:5,65
to 180 degrees. This isn't necessary, what
this does is it helps create a thicker yogurt;


257
0:33:5,65 --> 0:33:7,76
helps kind of loosen up the structure of the
proteins so that when bacteria come, it will


258
0:33:7,76 --> 0:33:7,76
help tie them a little bit better. This is
the yogurt after it's finished; so after you


259
0:33:7,76 --> 0:33:7,77
heat up to 180 degrees, you're going to cool
it down to about a 100 to a 110 which is the


260
0:33:7,77 --> 0:33:7,78
ideal temperature to make yogurt at. You're
going to add your starter and then you just


261
0:33:7,78 --> 0:33:7,79
kind of try to leave it at that temperature
for a long period of time. I guess, at eight


262
0:33:7,79 --> 0:33:7,8
to 12 hours up to 24. The longer you leave
it, the more sour your product will be. So,


263
0:33:7,8 --> 0:33:7,81
if you want to less sour product, you leave
it for eight hours. You want a more sour product,


264
0:33:7,81 --> 0:33:8,37
you leave it for 20 hours. Well, what happened
is, the enzymes will breakdown and will start


265
0:33:8,37 --> 0:33:11,11
to sour the product and it will make lactic
acid, and it will actually thicken the yogurt


266
0:33:11,11 --> 0:33:11,48
up. Cheese is a little bit different because
you don't actually need the fermentation product


267
0:33:11,48 --> 0:33:11,55
to make the cheese initially. You need the
fermentation product to help ripen the cheese


268
0:33:11,55 --> 0:33:11,64
afterwards. So, what we're doing is we're
adding acid to some kind of milk base and


269
0:33:11,64 --> 0:33:11,99
heating it to a certain temperature that will
actually cause the milk to separate into curds


270
0:33:11,99 --> 0:33:12,3
and whey; the whey is a liquid and curd is
the solids. You can also use rennet which


271
0:33:12,3 --> 0:33:12,7
is an enzyme as apparent, a lot of animal
stomachs--a lot linings of different animals.


272
0:33:12,7 --> 0:33:12,11
And then what you'll do is you'll strain the
whey off, you'll leave the solids and then


273
0:33:12,11 --> 0:33:12,15
you'll just let them sit. And that's how you'll
get the fermentation product of your cheese.


274
0:33:12,15 --> 0:33:12,18
You can add different strains of bacteria
to get different kinds of cheeses and that's


275
0:33:12,18 --> 0:33:12,22
why there's so many different cheeses on the
market because depending on the area they're


276
0:33:12,22 --> 0:33:12,34
from, depending on what's in the environment,
that's where the flavors are coming from.


277
0:33:12,34 --> 0:33:12,36
Blue cheese is one of the most notorious.
It's a very, very, rapidly growing organism


278
0:33:12,36 --> 0:33:12,39
that spreads very quickly. So, if you're in
an environment that made blue cheese, you


279
0:33:12,39 --> 0:33:12,41
most likely will have everything else in the
environment turn into blue cheese or have


280
0:33:12,41 --> 0:33:12,44
that same mold on it within a couple of days
because it's that rapid, it takes over with


281
0:33:12,44 --> 0:33:13,7
that any other bacteria. Grain ferments; also
very popular, we're going to talk about sourdough


282
0:33:13,7 --> 0:33:14,94
breads. What happens is, when you add the
addition of water to grains, you're helping


283
0:33:14,94 --> 0:33:16,8
activate the yeast that are already naturally
on the grains, and you're helping to break


284
0:33:16,8 --> 0:33:18,64
down those grains to help your body process
them a little bit better. The addition of


285
0:33:18,64 --> 0:33:30,26
water will cause the yeast to activate; they
will actually start to eat the carbohydrates


286
0:33:30,26 --> 0:33:33,59
of the grain themselves and help loosen them,
like they're converted into a more digestible


287
0:33:33,59 --> 0:33:37,17
product. This yeast are found pretty much
everywhere, may be kind of sugar, if you've


288
0:33:37,17 --> 0:33:41,47
ever looked at some kind of plum or grape?
That white film on the outside of your fruit


289
0:33:41,47 --> 0:33:45,29
is actually yeast; they're feeding on the
sugars of the fruit itself. So this is how


290
0:33:45,29 --> 0:33:47,35
you start a basic sourdough bread. All you
really do is just take flour and water and


291
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
put them together, put a cover over it and
let it sit. What I did for mine is I actually


292
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
used potato water. I cooked some potatoes,
after I cooked the potatoes, I saved the water


293
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
and I turned that into a sourdough bread.
That extra starch from the potatoes just give


294
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
something extra for the yeast to heat on.
So what you'll do is, you mix those two products


295
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
together, let it sit at the ideal temperature
again from 80 to 110 degrees in an open air


296
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
container. You want to leave it open air at
the beginning because this is where the yeast


297
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
are going to come from, they're going to come
from the air. You can add baker's yeast if


298
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
you want but that kind of defeats the purpose
of having this sourdough that's made with


299
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
things that are naturally occurring in the
environment. You have that sit overnight with


300
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
the temperature–-the ideal temperature,
the next day you come back to it, you remove


301
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
half of it, and then add the same amount of
flour and water that you removed. It's introduced


302
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
again, newer yeast helps add some more carbohydrates
so that the yeast can feed up and proliferate


303
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
more. You do this for about three to four
days until you start to see a bubble. Once


304
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
it bubbles, then you have a solid starter.
That bubbling means that the yeast are active,


305
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
they're creating lactic acid which is where
that sourness is going to come from, and it


306
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
means that, they're going to continue to be
active as long as they keep being fed, as


307
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
long as you keep the phytonutrients of heat
and sugar for them, they'll keep going. So


308
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
these starters can pretty much be kept indefinitely.
Some of the sourdoughs from the San Francisco


309
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
are over a hundred years old because they
started sourdough a hundred years ago. They


310
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
take out half of it, make bread, add more
flour and water, and they just keep making


311
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
it everyday using that same starter. And then
over time, it evolves a lot of different flavors


312
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
from a lot of different organisms. This is
another fermentation practice which, if you


313
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
watch my Twitter, this is one of the first
things that I have kind of experiments with,


314
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
is fermented oatmeal. You take any kind of
oats, soak it in water overnight, and the


315
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
yeast present in the oatmeal will actually
kind of breakdown starch and will result in


316
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
a very, very kind of creamy gelatins oatmeal.
Fruit Ferments, we see this with wine. We


317
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
see this with different kinds of root beers,
we see this with–-I guess it would be grain,


318
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
we see this is as normal beer, as well that
the addition of fruit is normal in making


319
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
normal beers. What are you doing is basically
again taking those naturally occurring yeast


320
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
in the air and they're feeding off the sugar
of the fruit. Specific sugars would kind of


321
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
help change for the final fermentation and
add the final flavor. So, if you're using


322
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
honey, if you're using molasses, if you're
using sorghum, if you're using brown sugar,


323
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
each one of these sugars has a different flavor
profile and different types of organisms that


324
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
be attracted to, let's say, honey then brown
sugar. That's pretty much it. I have a bunch


325
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
of products here that we're all going to taste.
I have a fruit kimchi that's made with pineapple,


326
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
grapes, cilantro, ginger, some other spices;
again, let it sit it for a week. I have a


327
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
normal kimchi that's made in a very traditional
style, this has radish, some greens, chili


328
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
pepper, garlic, ginger. I have homemade sauerkraut
that has the addition of apples and onions


329
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
to it. I have some yogurts. I have a full
fat yogurt that's made of 40% fat. Kind of


330
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
comes out to the consistency of sour cream.
I also have a normal fat, with a 5% fat yogurt.


331
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
I also have some butter that was made with
the yogurt; let me talk about that process


332
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
if you like. And I also have some--it's a
ginger beer recipe but I made it with galangal.


333
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
Basically, took ginger, shred it up, mixed
it with sugar and water to have the environment


334
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
so that the yeast can grow. Once they started
to grow, you add that to a base ginger and


335
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
sugar. Once you put on that base, you add
the starter that you made with the active


336
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
cultures then you put it in an anaerobic environment
by putting into a bottle and letting it sit.


337
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
This will start to create--they will eat the
sugars and create alcohol and CO2, and that's


338
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
when the carbonation comes from because they're
concentrating that CO2 into the bottle; so,


339
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
it can't escape, so, it's infusing itself
into the water to create carbonation. So,


340
0:33:47,35 --> 0:33:47,35
yeah, if you guys want to come up and have
a taste some stuff. That's pretty much it


341
0:33:47,35 --> 0:35:47,35
for the fermentation talk. In case you have
any questions you guys [INDISTINCT].
