1
0:3:1,125 --> 0:3:5,542
- 1925, and the Prince of Wales
embarks on his tour


2
0:3:5,542 --> 0:3:8,125
of the Indian subcontinent,


3
0:3:8,125 --> 0:3:12,125
the welcoming cheers that greet
the heir to the imperial throne


4
0:3:12,125 --> 0:3:14,375
proof positive
that India remains


5
0:3:14,375 --> 0:3:17,167
just as steadfastly loyal
to the Crown


6
0:3:17,167 --> 0:3:20,209
as it was in the days
of his great-grandmother


7
0:3:20,209 --> 0:3:49,875
Queen Victoria.


8
0:3:49,875 --> 0:3:51,84
- Wait there a minute.


9
0:3:51,84 --> 0:3:55,792
- Sir.


10
0:3:55,792 --> 0:3:59,209
- Which is the lady
that I must seize upon?


11
0:3:59,209 --> 0:4:2,667
- This same is she,
and I do give you her.


12
0:4:2,667 --> 0:4:5,84
- Why, then she's mine.


13
0:4:5,84 --> 0:4:6,417
Sweet, let me see your face.


14
0:4:6,417 --> 0:4:9,584
I am your husband,
if you like of me.


15
0:4:9,584 --> 0:4:13,417
Give me your hand
before this holy friar.


16
0:4:13,417 --> 0:4:15,584
- Soft and fair, friar.


17
0:4:15,584 --> 0:4:17,167
Which is Beatrice?


18
0:4:17,167 --> 0:4:19,959
- I answer to that name.


19
0:4:19,959 --> 0:4:21,709
What is your will?


20
0:4:21,709 --> 0:4:23,0
- Do not you love me?


21
0:4:23,0 --> 0:4:26,542
- Why, no,
no more than reason.


22
0:4:26,542 --> 0:4:28,542
Do not you love me?


23
0:4:28,542 --> 0:4:31,42
- Troth, no,
no more than reason.


24
0:4:31,42 --> 0:4:34,875
- Why, then my cousin, Margaret,
and Ursula are much deceived,


25
0:4:34,875 --> 0:4:55,375
for they did swear you did.


26
0:4:55,375 --> 0:5:0,25
Oh, what a totally ghastly
audience.


27
0:5:0,25 --> 0:5:3,625
I didn't think
they were too bad.


28
0:5:3,625 --> 0:5:12,584
- And now for another
transformation scene.


29
0:5:12,584 --> 0:5:15,42
How to make myself
look respectable


30
0:5:15,42 --> 0:5:16,25
for Government House.


31
0:5:16,25 --> 0:5:17,959
- Oh, I'm so excited!


32
0:5:17,959 --> 0:5:20,0
- Me too.


33
0:5:20,0 --> 0:5:21,792
- Is Mr. Blunt waiting?


34
0:5:21,792 --> 0:5:23,959
- He better be.


35
0:5:23,959 --> 0:5:26,5
- You're quite serious
about him, aren't you?


36
0:5:26,5 --> 0:5:28,75
- I know you don't approve.


37
0:5:28,75 --> 0:5:30,834
- Oh, it's not my place
to approve.


38
0:5:30,834 --> 0:5:32,959
- Oh, don't be
so mamby-pamby, Mabelle.


39
0:5:32,959 --> 0:5:35,709
You think he's not good enough
for me.


40
0:5:35,709 --> 0:5:37,459
- I just don't understand you.


41
0:5:37,459 --> 0:5:39,25
I mean, you're so ambitious,


42
0:5:39,25 --> 0:5:43,42
and with your background,
you could--


43
0:5:43,42 --> 0:5:44,125
Who is it?


44
0:5:44,125 --> 0:5:47,167
- Come in.


45
0:5:47,167 --> 0:5:49,917
- Well, come on, girls.


46
0:5:49,917 --> 0:5:55,709
The prince is waiting.


47
0:5:55,709 --> 0:5:59,0
- The young prince
immerses himself wholeheartedly


48
0:5:59,0 --> 0:6:1,959
in the exhausting schedule
of duties entailed


49
0:6:1,959 --> 0:6:5,0
in such a great enterprise.


50
0:6:5,0 --> 0:6:7,459
In the stifling heat
of an Indian midsummer,


51
0:6:7,459 --> 0:6:9,42
the grandest reception of all


52
0:6:9,42 --> 0:6:22,167
is held at Government House,
Calcutta.


53
0:6:22,167 --> 0:6:24,334
- There she is.


54
0:6:24,334 --> 0:6:27,42
Why aren't you dancing, Mabelle?


55
0:6:27,42 --> 0:6:29,459
- Oh, it's so hot in there.


56
0:6:29,459 --> 0:6:32,292
Did you meet the Prince
of Wales, Mr. Blunt?


57
0:6:32,292 --> 0:6:36,42
- No, never got closer
than five yards.


58
0:6:36,42 --> 0:6:37,75
- We've got something
to tell you.


59
0:6:37,75 --> 0:6:39,834
- Oh, no, Gerda, please.
You promised--


60
0:6:39,834 --> 0:6:42,625
- Alistair wants it kept secret
from his stuffy family,


61
0:6:42,625 --> 0:6:44,875
but we're going to be married!


62
0:6:44,875 --> 0:6:46,25
- Oh.


63
0:6:46,25 --> 0:6:51,375
Oh, that's wonderful.


64
0:6:51,375 --> 0:6:53,875
Congratulations, Mr. Blunt.


65
0:6:53,875 --> 0:6:54,959
When will this be?


66
0:6:54,959 --> 0:6:56,459
- Quite soon, actually.


67
0:6:56,459 --> 0:7:0,42
Alistair's bank want him
back in London next month.


68
0:7:0,42 --> 0:7:1,75
Oh, come on, Alistair.


69
0:7:1,75 --> 0:7:4,167
I want to dance!


70
0:7:4,167 --> 0:7:11,125
- Excuse us, please,
Miss Sainsbury Seale.


71
0:7:11,125 --> 0:7:15,334
- And so at last,
time to say good-bye.


72
0:7:15,334 --> 0:7:19,917
As he leaves India, the jewel
of Britain's vast empire,


73
0:7:19,917 --> 0:7:21,75
the prince can look back
with pride


74
0:7:21,75 --> 0:7:24,5
at a job well done.


75
0:7:24,5 --> 0:7:26,25
We'd like to join
with the people of India


76
0:7:26,25 --> 0:9:7,75
in saying thank you and
God bless the Prince of Wales.


77
0:9:7,75 --> 0:9:28,792
- Sit yourself down, Mr. Poirot.


78
0:9:28,792 --> 0:9:33,417
Quite comfortable?


79
0:9:33,417 --> 0:9:35,917
We'll start the preparatory work
today, Mr. Poirot.


80
0:9:35,917 --> 0:9:37,167
- I'm so sorry to have kept you.


81
0:9:37,167 --> 0:9:40,417
- Oh, that's all right.


82
0:9:40,417 --> 0:9:43,917
Mr. Morley asked me
to make another appointment.


83
0:9:43,917 --> 0:9:46,375
- Ah.


84
0:9:46,375 --> 0:9:48,584
What about...


85
0:9:48,584 --> 0:9:52,542
the 6th of August at 11:45,
Miss Sainsbury Seale?


86
0:9:52,542 --> 0:10:22,42
- Uh, yes, that looks perfect.


87
0:10:22,42 --> 0:10:24,875
- Should I get out here
and take a cab, Uncle Alistair?


88
0:10:24,875 --> 0:10:26,125
- No, no, it's all right.


89
0:10:26,125 --> 0:10:27,834
I'll walk back to the office.


90
0:10:27,834 --> 0:10:29,542
Keep the car.
Finish your shopping.


91
0:10:29,542 --> 0:10:31,542
As long as I have it back
by half past 5:00.


92
0:10:31,542 --> 0:10:32,625
- Excuse me.


93
0:10:32,625 --> 0:10:35,0
It's Alistair Blunt, isn't it?


94
0:10:35,0 --> 0:10:36,292
- Yes?


95
0:10:36,292 --> 0:10:37,709
- You don't remember me.


96
0:10:37,709 --> 0:10:40,667
Mabelle.
Mabelle Sainsbury Seale.


97
0:10:40,667 --> 0:10:43,209
I was your wife's friend.


98
0:10:43,209 --> 0:10:45,667
- Yes.


99
0:10:45,667 --> 0:10:48,875
Yes, of course I remember you.


100
0:10:48,875 --> 0:10:51,459
Um, I'll see you at home later,
then, Jane.


101
0:10:51,459 --> 0:10:53,417
- It was in India,
if you remember.


102
0:10:53,417 --> 0:10:55,209
Gerda and I were on tour
together.


103
0:10:55,209 --> 0:10:58,84
I've only just come back
after all these years.


104
0:10:58,84 --> 0:11:3,167
Oh, I've been doing work for
the zenana missions, you know.


105
0:11:3,167 --> 0:11:4,75
- Well, it's wonderful
to see you again,


106
0:11:4,75 --> 0:11:6,75
Miss Sainsbury Seale,
it really is, but I--


107
0:11:6,75 --> 0:11:12,792
- I'd love to see Gerda again.


108
0:11:12,792 --> 0:11:14,209
- Miss Seale.


109
0:11:14,209 --> 0:11:18,42
- Sainsbury Seale.
Yes?


110
0:11:18,42 --> 0:11:21,209
Why, Mr. Amberiotis.


111
0:11:21,209 --> 0:11:22,625
Oh, I'm sorry.


112
0:11:22,625 --> 0:11:24,709
I didn't recognize you
for a moment.


113
0:11:24,709 --> 0:11:27,125
How nice.


114
0:11:27,125 --> 0:11:31,334
- I came to return...this.


115
0:11:31,334 --> 0:11:35,459
- My hot water bottle.


116
0:11:35,459 --> 0:11:36,917
Oh!


117
0:11:36,917 --> 0:11:39,167
What must you think.


118
0:11:39,167 --> 0:11:41,709
This gentleman and I
were on the boat


119
0:11:41,709 --> 0:11:43,834
coming back from India together.


120
0:11:43,834 --> 0:11:56,292
I lent him my hot water bottle
when he had a toothache.


121
0:11:56,292 --> 0:11:58,0
Have you been to a dentist yet


122
0:11:58,0 --> 0:11:59,834
about that tooth,
Mr. Amberiotis?


123
0:11:59,834 --> 0:12:1,667
- Not yet, no.


124
0:12:1,667 --> 0:12:3,209
It doesn't hurt so much.


125
0:12:3,209 --> 0:12:5,375
- That's very naughty of you.


126
0:12:5,375 --> 0:12:9,709
You must go and see my man,
Mr. Morley in Harley Street.


127
0:12:9,709 --> 0:12:12,5
As a matter of fact,
it's rather a coincidence.


128
0:12:12,5 --> 0:12:15,792
I saw him only this morning,
and as I was coming out,


129
0:12:15,792 --> 0:12:18,375
I ran into another old friend
from India--


130
0:12:18,375 --> 0:12:20,292
but from much longer ago,
of course.


131
0:12:20,292 --> 0:12:22,84
His wife and I were together


132
0:12:22,84 --> 0:12:24,42
in the touring company
I told you about.


133
0:12:24,42 --> 0:12:26,959
- Oh, yes, yes.


134
0:12:26,959 --> 0:12:28,667
When you were an actress.


135
0:12:28,667 --> 0:12:30,209
- Quite.


136
0:12:30,209 --> 0:12:32,75
And he's done awfully well,
I believe, since then.


137
0:12:32,75 --> 0:12:34,334
Mr. Alistair Blunt.


138
0:12:34,334 --> 0:12:37,709
- Mr. Alistair Blunt the banker?


139
0:12:37,709 --> 0:12:39,459
- I believe so.


140
0:12:39,459 --> 0:12:42,167
He certainly used to work
in a bank when he met Gerda.


141
0:12:42,167 --> 0:12:44,917
- Gerda?


142
0:12:44,917 --> 0:12:46,875
- His wife.


143
0:12:46,875 --> 0:12:49,792
Oh, we were such pals.


144
0:12:49,792 --> 0:12:52,125
Of course, she was
a better actress than I.


145
0:12:52,125 --> 0:12:54,959
I always said she'd get on
in the profession,


146
0:12:54,959 --> 0:12:57,625
but she left it
to marry Alistair,


147
0:12:57,625 --> 0:13:9,667
and I left it to stay in India.


148
0:13:9,667 --> 0:14:6,875
- Thank you, sir.


149
0:14:6,875 --> 0:14:35,0
- Hold tight, please.


150
0:14:35,0 --> 0:14:36,84
- Oh.


151
0:14:36,84 --> 0:14:37,375
- Yes, ma'am.


152
0:14:37,375 --> 0:14:39,375
- My name's Sainsbury Seale.


153
0:14:39,375 --> 0:14:40,625
I want to see Mrs. Blunt.


154
0:14:40,625 --> 0:14:42,584
She's staying with Mrs. Chapman.


155
0:14:42,584 --> 0:14:44,0
- Mrs. Chapman, right.


156
0:14:44,0 --> 0:14:51,0
This way, ma'am.


157
0:14:51,0 --> 0:14:53,209
Number 45, ma'am, just there.


158
0:14:53,209 --> 0:15:0,834
- Thank you so much.


159
0:15:0,834 --> 0:15:2,5
Gerda!


160
0:15:2,5 --> 0:15:16,167
After all these years.


161
0:15:16,167 --> 0:15:19,875
- Where are you going
with those?


162
0:15:19,875 --> 0:15:21,834
- Miss Sainsbury Seale
telephoned, miss.


163
0:15:21,834 --> 0:15:23,375
She's moving
to the Carlisle Hotel


164
0:15:23,375 --> 0:15:26,292
in South Kensington,
wants her bags sent on.


165
0:15:26,292 --> 0:15:40,75
- Oh, yes.
Go on, then.


166
0:15:40,75 --> 0:15:44,0
- That damn boy's late again.


167
0:15:44,0 --> 0:15:47,584
And smoking
on the front doorstep.


168
0:15:47,584 --> 0:15:50,292
Young people nowadays--


169
0:15:50,292 --> 0:15:54,667
unreliable, self-centered.


170
0:15:54,667 --> 0:15:57,542
The girls are as bad.


171
0:15:57,542 --> 0:15:59,334
Gladys isn't coming in today.


172
0:15:59,334 --> 0:16:1,75
Her aunt's had a stroke, and
she's had to go up to Yorkshire.


173
0:16:1,75 --> 0:16:5,459
- That's hardly
the girl's fault.


174
0:16:5,459 --> 0:16:7,834
- She's been different lately.


175
0:16:7,834 --> 0:16:9,792
It's that Frank Carter fellow.


176
0:16:9,792 --> 0:16:13,0
- Girls do fall in love, Henry.


177
0:16:13,0 --> 0:16:14,209
- Love?


178
0:16:14,209 --> 0:16:16,334
She's a cut above him,
I should hope.


179
0:16:16,334 --> 0:16:18,292
You know he's in
with that Blackshirt mob.


180
0:16:18,292 --> 0:16:20,584
Anyway, she shouldn't let it
affect her efficiency


181
0:16:20,584 --> 0:16:22,167
as my secretary.


182
0:16:22,167 --> 0:16:38,417
Let her fall in love
in her own time.


183
0:16:38,417 --> 0:16:41,875
- Good morning, Mr. Amberiotis.


184
0:16:41,875 --> 0:16:43,459
Is everything all right, sir?


185
0:16:43,459 --> 0:16:45,292
- What?


186
0:16:45,292 --> 0:16:47,584
No.


187
0:16:47,584 --> 0:16:55,917
Yes, it's just a...toothache.


188
0:16:55,917 --> 0:17:26,292
Take it away.


189
0:17:26,292 --> 0:18:24,209
- Thank you.


190
0:18:24,209 --> 0:18:51,709
- Mr. Por-oat?


191
0:18:51,709 --> 0:18:54,0
- Till the end
of the financial year.


192
0:18:54,0 --> 0:18:58,292
- Thank you, Charles.


193
0:18:58,292 --> 0:18:59,625
Any other business?


194
0:18:59,625 --> 0:19:2,417
- There's the question
of the debenture issue.


195
0:19:2,417 --> 0:19:4,625
- That was covered
on the agenda.


196
0:19:4,625 --> 0:19:7,459
- Yes, but we left
the date open.


197
0:19:7,459 --> 0:19:9,84
- Quite.


198
0:19:9,84 --> 0:19:10,209
That's all, I think.


199
0:19:10,209 --> 0:19:11,292
Meeting closed.


200
0:19:11,292 --> 0:19:20,42
Thank you, gentlemen.


201
0:19:20,42 --> 0:19:21,792
- All right, Alistair?


202
0:19:21,792 --> 0:19:23,167
- All right?
Yes, I'm fine.


203
0:19:23,167 --> 0:19:24,709
- Can I give you a lift?


204
0:19:24,709 --> 0:19:27,0
- No, my car's waiting.
I'm going to the dentist.


205
0:19:27,0 --> 0:19:30,125
- I see. That's why you were
in such a bad mood.


206
0:19:30,125 --> 0:19:35,334
- We'll get your treatment
finished today, Mr. Poirot.


207
0:19:35,334 --> 0:19:37,42
Now, as I was saying,


208
0:19:37,42 --> 0:19:41,125
the important people,
they're always on time.


209
0:19:41,125 --> 0:19:44,917
Now, I've got a most important
man coming this morning.


210
0:19:44,917 --> 0:19:46,25
- Mr. Alistair Blunt.


211
0:19:46,25 --> 0:19:47,667
Alistair Blunt?


212
0:19:47,667 --> 0:19:48,792
- Oh, yes.


213
0:19:48,792 --> 0:19:51,84
Always on time.


214
0:19:51,84 --> 0:19:53,584
Nice, unassuming fellow.


215
0:19:53,584 --> 0:19:57,167
Often sends his Rolls away
and walks back to the office


216
0:19:57,167 --> 0:19:58,584
just like you and me.


217
0:19:58,584 --> 0:20:22,292
You would never dream
he could buy up half Europe.


218
0:20:22,292 --> 0:20:25,42
Well, good-bye, Mr. Poirot.


219
0:20:25,42 --> 0:20:26,417
Wasn't too bad this time,
was it?


220
0:20:26,417 --> 0:20:27,5
- No.


221
0:20:27,5 --> 0:20:28,875
- Shall I ring for the lift
for you?


222
0:20:28,875 --> 0:20:30,542
- No, no, no, thank you.
I shall walk down.


223
0:20:30,542 --> 0:21:3,792
- I'll see you in six months.


224
0:21:3,792 --> 0:21:11,542
- Mr. Blunt.


225
0:21:11,542 --> 0:21:28,334
- Excuse me.


226
0:21:28,334 --> 0:21:29,709
- Ooh!


227
0:21:29,709 --> 0:21:35,459
- Oh!


228
0:21:35,459 --> 0:21:36,834
- So kind.


229
0:21:36,834 --> 0:21:38,209
- Not at all, madame.


230
0:21:38,209 --> 0:21:39,25
- Ooh!


231
0:21:39,25 --> 0:21:41,167
- Oh, dear.


232
0:21:41,167 --> 0:21:42,459
- Thank you.


233
0:21:42,459 --> 0:21:43,625
- You're welcome, madame.


234
0:21:43,625 --> 0:21:52,75
- Thank you so much.


235
0:21:52,75 --> 0:21:54,5
- I have an appointment
with Mr. Morley.


236
0:21:54,5 --> 0:21:55,584
- Name?


237
0:21:55,584 --> 0:23:5,209
- Miss Sainsbury Seale.


238
0:23:5,209 --> 0:23:7,0
- Well?


239
0:23:7,0 --> 0:23:10,0
I have now been waiting
for 45 minutes.


240
0:23:10,0 --> 0:23:12,834
My appointment
was for half past 12:00.


241
0:23:12,834 --> 0:23:14,84
- Well, I know--


242
0:23:14,84 --> 0:23:16,25
- I shall now go back
to Worthing!


243
0:23:16,25 --> 0:23:25,42
You may tell Mr. Morley
that I am most displeased.


244
0:23:25,42 --> 0:24:4,0
- "I am most displeased."


245
0:24:4,0 --> 0:24:28,334
Oh, my god.


246
0:24:28,334 --> 0:24:32,292
- Revolver grasped
in lifeless fingers.


247
0:24:32,292 --> 0:24:34,875
Doesn't seem to be much doubt
about it, does there?


248
0:24:34,875 --> 0:24:41,834
It has to be suicide.


249
0:24:41,834 --> 0:24:43,792
- C'est incroyable.


250
0:24:43,792 --> 0:24:47,459
- All right,
you can move him now.


251
0:24:47,459 --> 0:24:50,625
- So tell me,
Chief Inspector Japp.


252
0:24:50,625 --> 0:24:53,167
- Lived upstairs
with his sister.


253
0:24:53,167 --> 0:24:55,375
Hasn't been moody or depressed.


254
0:24:55,375 --> 0:24:57,25
I wondered
if you'd noticed anything


255
0:24:57,25 --> 0:24:58,542
when you saw him this morning.


256
0:24:58,542 --> 0:25:0,667
- Nothing at all.


257
0:25:0,667 --> 0:25:5,292
He was, what shall I say,
normality itself.


258
0:25:5,292 --> 0:25:7,667
When did it occur, this tragedy?


259
0:25:7,667 --> 0:25:9,459
- Can't say exactly.


260
0:25:9,459 --> 0:25:11,792
Nobody seems to have heard
the shot.


261
0:25:11,792 --> 0:25:16,75
It was discovered about 1:30
by the pageboy, Alfred Biggs.


262
0:25:16,75 --> 0:25:18,417
- At what time
did Monsieur Morley


263
0:25:18,417 --> 0:25:20,459
last press the buzzer
for a new patient?


264
0:25:20,459 --> 0:25:23,625
- 5 past 12:00,
and the boy showed up


265
0:25:23,625 --> 0:25:28,167
the patient who was waiting,
a Mr. Amberiotis,


266
0:25:28,167 --> 0:25:30,84
staying at the Astoria Hotel,


267
0:25:30,84 --> 0:25:31,625
according to
the appointment book.


268
0:25:31,625 --> 0:25:35,625
- And at what time did he leave,
this Monsieur Amberiotis?


269
0:25:35,625 --> 0:25:37,125
- Well, the boy
didn't show him out,


270
0:25:37,125 --> 0:25:38,417
so he doesn't know.


271
0:25:38,417 --> 0:25:42,334
But I rang up the Astoria,
and Mr. Amberiotis says


272
0:25:42,334 --> 0:25:44,625
he looked at his watch
as he closed the front door


273
0:25:44,625 --> 0:25:50,667
and it was exactly
25 past 12:00.


274
0:25:50,667 --> 0:25:53,84
- So at 25 minutes past 12:00,


275
0:25:53,84 --> 0:25:54,917
our dentist,
he is the normal dentist, eh--


276
0:25:54,917 --> 0:25:56,917
cheerful, competent, urbane.


277
0:25:56,917 --> 0:26:0,167
And the very next moment,
despair, misery, what you will,


278
0:26:0,167 --> 0:26:1,959
and he shoots himself?


279
0:26:1,959 --> 0:26:4,84
No.


280
0:26:4,84 --> 0:26:6,334
- It's quite incredible to me


281
0:26:6,334 --> 0:26:8,834
that my brother
should have committed suicide.


282
0:26:8,834 --> 0:26:12,292
- He'd been quite
his usual self, had he, madam?


283
0:26:12,292 --> 0:26:14,84
Not upset in any way?


284
0:26:14,84 --> 0:26:16,292
- He was annoyed.


285
0:26:16,292 --> 0:26:18,25
He had a busy day
in front of him,


286
0:26:18,25 --> 0:26:20,5
and his assistant
had received a telegram


287
0:26:20,5 --> 0:26:22,667
to say her aunt had
had a stroke.


288
0:26:22,667 --> 0:26:25,84
She left for Yorkshire
by an early train.


289
0:26:25,84 --> 0:26:28,625
- And your brother,
he was annoyed at this?


290
0:26:28,625 --> 0:26:30,917
- Well, the fact is...


291
0:26:30,917 --> 0:26:32,834
His assistant's got engaged


292
0:26:32,834 --> 0:26:35,25
to a rather unsuitable
young man,


293
0:26:35,25 --> 0:26:37,667
and it occurred to Henry
that this young man


294
0:26:37,667 --> 0:26:39,75
had persuaded her
to take the day off.


295
0:26:39,75 --> 0:26:42,84
- What does he do,
this young man?


296
0:26:42,84 --> 0:26:46,542
- Frank Carter is--or was--
an insurance clerk.


297
0:26:46,542 --> 0:26:50,209
He lost his job a few weeks ago
and seems unable to get another.


298
0:26:50,209 --> 0:26:51,834
- Did your brother try
and persuade her


299
0:26:51,834 --> 0:26:53,25
to break off her engagement?


300
0:26:53,25 --> 0:26:56,0
- Oh, yes, he did,
as a matter of fact.


301
0:26:56,0 --> 0:26:59,459
- So this Frank Carter would
quite possibly have a grudge


302
0:26:59,459 --> 0:27:2,125
against your brother.


303
0:27:2,125 --> 0:27:3,584
- It's that Miss Neville.


304
0:27:3,584 --> 0:27:5,75
She's back in a rare taking,
she is.


305
0:27:5,75 --> 0:27:7,625
- The whole thing was
a wicked practical joke.


306
0:27:7,625 --> 0:27:9,625
There wasn't anything wrong
with Auntie at all.


307
0:27:9,625 --> 0:27:12,42
She couldn't understand it
when I suddenly turned up.


308
0:27:12,42 --> 0:27:13,5
- Are you quite sure


309
0:27:13,5 --> 0:27:16,5
it wasn't your friend Mr. Carter
who sent this telegram?


310
0:27:16,5 --> 0:27:19,167
- Frank?
Whatever for?


311
0:27:19,167 --> 0:27:22,167
Oh, I see what you mean.


312
0:27:22,167 --> 0:27:23,459
A put-up job between us.


313
0:27:23,459 --> 0:27:25,375
We wouldn't do
a thing like that.


314
0:27:25,375 --> 0:27:27,209
- Tell me, mademoiselle,


315
0:27:27,209 --> 0:27:29,709
what patients had Mr. Morley
this morning?


316
0:27:29,709 --> 0:27:38,5
- They're all in here.


317
0:27:38,5 --> 0:27:42,667
Um, at 10:00, Mrs. Soames
about her new plate.


318
0:27:42,667 --> 0:27:45,625
10:30, Lady Gregson.
She's an elderly lady.


319
0:27:45,625 --> 0:27:48,334
11:00, Mr. Hercule Poirot.


320
0:27:48,334 --> 0:27:50,875
Oh, that's you, isn't it?


321
0:27:50,875 --> 0:27:54,917
11:30, Mr. Alistair Blunt--
you know, the banker.


322
0:27:54,917 --> 0:27:56,917
Then Miss Sainsbury Seale.


323
0:27:56,917 --> 0:27:58,375
She's just back from India.


324
0:27:58,375 --> 0:28:0,375
12:00, Mr. Amberiotis.


325
0:28:0,375 --> 0:28:2,459
He was a new patient,


326
0:28:2,459 --> 0:28:5,5
made his appointment
from the Astoria Hotel.


327
0:28:5,5 --> 0:28:12,167
And 12:30, Mrs. Pinner.
She comes up from Worthing.


328
0:28:12,167 --> 0:28:14,375
- If you please, Alfred,
tell me,


329
0:28:14,375 --> 0:28:16,667
is it possible
for anyone to enter the house


330
0:28:16,667 --> 0:28:18,25
without you
having to let them in?


331
0:28:18,25 --> 0:28:19,709
- Nah.


332
0:28:19,709 --> 0:28:21,84
No, not a chance.


333
0:28:21,84 --> 0:28:23,334
Well, not unless they got a key,
anyway.


334
0:28:23,334 --> 0:28:26,84
- But it is quite easy for them
to leave the house.


335
0:28:26,84 --> 0:28:28,292
- Oh, yeah.


336
0:28:28,292 --> 0:28:30,584
Yeah, most of them
come down the stairs


337
0:28:30,584 --> 0:28:32,875
while I'm taking the new party
up in the lift, see.


338
0:28:32,875 --> 0:28:35,459
- Did you see Mr. Amberiotis
leave?


339
0:28:35,459 --> 0:28:36,959
- Nah.


340
0:28:36,959 --> 0:28:38,834
No, he must have
let himself out.


341
0:28:38,834 --> 0:28:40,75
- But you are quite sure
that nobody else came


342
0:28:40,75 --> 0:28:43,334
to the house this morning,
only the patients.


343
0:28:43,334 --> 0:28:45,584
- That Mrs. Neville's young man
came round.


344
0:28:45,584 --> 0:28:48,209
In a bit of a paddy, he was,
not to find her here.


345
0:28:48,209 --> 0:28:50,584
- We haven't heard about this
before.


346
0:28:50,584 --> 0:28:52,209
- Well, when I told him


347
0:28:52,209 --> 0:28:53,292
Miss Neville was out
for the day,


348
0:28:53,292 --> 0:28:54,709
he got quite shirty,


349
0:28:54,709 --> 0:28:57,709
said he'd wait
and see Mr. Morley.


350
0:28:57,709 --> 0:28:59,375
Well, then he went
into the waiting room.


351
0:28:59,375 --> 0:29:1,459
You must have seen him there,
sir.


352
0:29:1,459 --> 0:29:3,459
- Ah, yes.


353
0:29:3,459 --> 0:29:6,292
The troubled young man
who would not sit down.


354
0:29:6,292 --> 0:29:9,459
- Yeah, must have got tired
of waiting, I suppose.


355
0:29:9,459 --> 0:29:13,792
He wasn't there later.


356
0:29:13,792 --> 0:29:17,0
- Why, Chief Inspector Japp,
an officer of your eminence,


357
0:29:17,0 --> 0:29:20,0
is he usually called in
to a case of apparent suicide?


358
0:29:20,0 --> 0:29:21,459
- Alistair Blunt was here.


359
0:29:21,459 --> 0:29:24,917
Mr. Blunt is the kind of person
we take care of in this country.


360
0:29:24,917 --> 0:29:26,584
- You mean that there are
certain people


361
0:29:26,584 --> 0:29:27,917
who would like him
out of the way?


362
0:29:27,917 --> 0:29:29,84
- You bet there are.


363
0:29:29,84 --> 0:29:30,459
The Reds, to begin with.


364
0:29:30,459 --> 0:29:32,334
And our Blackshirted friends.


365
0:29:32,334 --> 0:29:33,959
This Blunt and his group
have a standing


366
0:29:33,959 --> 0:29:35,875
behind the present government.


367
0:29:35,875 --> 0:29:43,584
- That is more or less
as I guessed.


368
0:29:43,584 --> 0:29:46,834
Tell me something about
Monsieur Blunt, Chief Inspector.


369
0:29:46,834 --> 0:29:48,417
- Alistair Blunt?


370
0:29:48,417 --> 0:29:51,42
He controls all
the Arnholt interests in Europe


371
0:29:51,42 --> 0:29:53,25
as well as the merchant banks.


372
0:29:53,25 --> 0:29:56,0
He married into the family.


373
0:29:56,0 --> 0:29:58,459
We oughtn't spend too long
with him.


374
0:29:58,459 --> 0:30:0,375
I want to get on to the Astoria.


375
0:30:0,375 --> 0:30:3,42
As it stands at the moment,
this Mr. Amberiotis


376
0:30:3,42 --> 0:30:6,75
was the last person
to see Mr. Morley alive.


377
0:30:6,75 --> 0:30:9,25
- This is the second occasion
this year


378
0:30:9,25 --> 0:30:12,334
that my allowance has not been
paid on time, Alistair.


379
0:30:12,334 --> 0:30:16,25
- You must talk to the bank,
Julia, or to the trustees.


380
0:30:16,25 --> 0:30:20,584
- If only my poor dear sister
were still alive.


381
0:30:20,584 --> 0:30:21,834
- If she were alive, Mother,


382
0:30:21,834 --> 0:30:23,542
you couldn't benefit
from her will.


383
0:30:23,542 --> 0:30:25,709
- That is a wicked thing to say,
Jane.


384
0:30:25,709 --> 0:30:27,834
- It's not wicked; it's true.


385
0:30:27,834 --> 0:30:31,84
- The truth is often wicked.


386
0:30:31,84 --> 0:30:34,334
- I'm sorry, Julie;
this is not my business.


387
0:30:34,334 --> 0:30:36,292
When I die, the capital
will come to you,


388
0:30:36,292 --> 0:30:38,84
to do with exactly as you wish.


389
0:30:38,84 --> 0:30:39,709
Until then--


390
0:30:39,709 --> 0:30:44,625
- Until then, I am expected
to exist--I won't say "live"--


391
0:30:44,625 --> 0:30:47,5
on the pittance from the trust.


392
0:30:47,5 --> 0:31:5,0
- $25,000 a year can scarcely
be called a pittance.


393
0:31:5,0 --> 0:31:7,84
- Do you think
Rebecca intended me


394
0:31:7,84 --> 0:31:8,792
to live on your charity?


395
0:31:8,792 --> 0:31:13,334
- It is not charity.


396
0:31:13,334 --> 0:31:15,84
Yes, Miss Montressor.


397
0:31:15,84 --> 0:31:18,917
- A Chief Inspector Japp and
a Mr. Poirot to see you, sir.


398
0:31:18,917 --> 0:31:24,959
- Really?
Would you show them in, please?


399
0:31:24,959 --> 0:31:26,25
Chief Inspector Japp.


400
0:31:26,25 --> 0:31:27,459
- How do you do, sir?


401
0:31:27,459 --> 0:31:29,667
This is Mr. Hercule Poirot.


402
0:31:29,667 --> 0:31:32,209
- I know your name, of course,
Monsieur Poirot,


403
0:31:32,209 --> 0:31:35,167
but surely somewhere
quite recently--


404
0:31:35,167 --> 0:31:36,542
- This morning, Monsieur Blunt.


405
0:31:36,542 --> 0:31:38,459
In the waiting room
of the dentist,


406
0:31:38,459 --> 0:31:40,42
the pauvre Monsieur Morley.


407
0:31:40,42 --> 0:31:42,5
- Yes, of course.
I knew I'd seen you somewhere.


408
0:31:42,5 --> 0:31:44,42
"Pauvre"?


409
0:31:44,42 --> 0:31:47,84
- Mr. Morley was found dead,
sir, shortly after you left,


410
0:31:47,84 --> 0:31:50,834
an apparent suicide.


411
0:31:50,834 --> 0:31:52,25
- Morley?


412
0:31:52,25 --> 0:31:53,917
Suicide?


413
0:31:53,917 --> 0:31:55,792
- What an extraordinary thing.


414
0:31:55,792 --> 0:31:57,792
- Uh...


415
0:31:57,792 --> 0:31:58,917
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.


416
0:31:58,917 --> 0:32:0,917
This is my niece, Miss Olivera,


417
0:32:0,917 --> 0:32:2,667
and her mother, Mrs. Olivera.


418
0:32:2,667 --> 0:32:5,167
- Mademoiselle, madame.


419
0:32:5,167 --> 0:32:8,834
- I've never heard of a dentist
committing suicide before.


420
0:32:8,834 --> 0:32:11,5
Wouldn't happen in the States;
you can be sure of that.


421
0:32:11,5 --> 0:32:14,5
They're too damn rich
to kill themselves.


422
0:32:14,5 --> 0:32:18,0
- He seemed in good health and
spirits this morning, Mr. Blunt?


423
0:32:18,0 --> 0:32:19,75
- Well, I think so, yes.


424
0:32:19,75 --> 0:32:21,5
- Have you seen him often?


425
0:32:21,5 --> 0:32:23,542
- This is
my third or fourth visit.


426
0:32:23,542 --> 0:32:24,917
- Monsieur Blunt, who was it


427
0:32:24,917 --> 0:32:27,0
that recommended to you
Monsieur Morley originally?


428
0:32:27,0 --> 0:32:30,167
- Arnholt, one of my directors.
Lionel Arnholt.


429
0:32:30,167 --> 0:32:31,917
- We're just wondering,
you see, sir,


430
0:32:31,917 --> 0:32:34,0
whether it wasn't suicide
but murder


431
0:32:34,0 --> 0:32:38,875
and the real target
was yourself.


432
0:32:38,875 --> 0:32:41,125
- But that doesn't make
any sense at all.


433
0:32:41,125 --> 0:32:43,125
- Well, none of it does
at the moment, sir.


434
0:32:43,125 --> 0:33:14,459
That's the problem.


435
0:33:14,459 --> 0:33:17,0
- Good evening.


436
0:33:17,0 --> 0:33:19,5
- We'd like to see
Mr. Amberiotis.


437
0:33:19,5 --> 0:33:23,292
- I'm sorry, sir.
I'm afraid you can't.


438
0:33:23,292 --> 0:33:25,75
- Oh, yes, I can, my lad.


439
0:33:25,75 --> 0:33:26,834
Police.


440
0:33:26,834 --> 0:33:29,334
- You don't understand, sir.


441
0:33:29,334 --> 0:34:19,125
Mr. Amberiotis died
half an hour ago.


442
0:34:19,125 --> 0:34:20,667
- Interesting.


443
0:34:20,667 --> 0:34:22,625
- Interesting, Dr. Bennett?


444
0:34:22,625 --> 0:34:26,834
- Mr. Amberiotis died
of heart failure.


445
0:34:26,834 --> 0:34:29,125
- Heart failure?


446
0:34:29,125 --> 0:34:33,292
- Brought about by an overdose
of adrenaline and novocaine.


447
0:34:33,292 --> 0:34:34,667
- How large an overdose?


448
0:34:34,667 --> 0:34:36,125
- Oh, I can't say yet.


449
0:34:36,125 --> 0:34:38,542
These quantitative analyses
take time.


450
0:34:38,542 --> 0:34:40,84
I'll be able to tell you
tomorrow.


451
0:34:40,84 --> 0:34:42,292
- Novocaine's the stuff
dentists give you, isn't it?


452
0:34:42,292 --> 0:34:43,709
- That's right, Chief Inspector.


453
0:34:43,709 --> 0:34:52,959
The subject had been
to the dentist, I believe.


454
0:34:52,959 --> 0:34:54,459
- What a washout.


455
0:34:54,459 --> 0:34:55,959
- What do you mean,
Chief Inspector?


456
0:34:55,959 --> 0:34:58,75
- Morley makes a mistake
and injects an overdose.


457
0:34:58,75 --> 0:35:1,709
Then when Amberiotis is gone,
he realizes what he's done,


458
0:35:1,709 --> 0:35:3,709
can't face the music,
and shoots himself.


459
0:35:3,709 --> 0:35:6,0
- With a pistol
he is not known to possess?


460
0:35:6,0 --> 0:35:7,792
- Relations don't know
everything.


461
0:35:7,792 --> 0:35:9,542
- No, that is true, of course.


462
0:35:9,542 --> 0:35:12,375
- Well, there we are, then.


463
0:35:12,375 --> 0:35:16,292
- All the same, Chief Inspector,
it does not quite satisfy me.


464
0:35:16,292 --> 0:35:18,84
- Ah, cheer up, Poirot.


465
0:35:18,84 --> 0:35:23,5
We can't have
a nice juicy murder every time.


466
0:35:23,5 --> 0:35:27,42
- Committed suicide?
Mr. Morley?


467
0:35:27,42 --> 0:35:29,875
Poor man.


468
0:35:29,875 --> 0:35:33,125
I suppose he had something
on his mind.


469
0:35:33,125 --> 0:35:35,709
Such worrying times we live in.


470
0:35:35,709 --> 0:35:38,959
- Did he seem worried to you,
Miss Sainsbury Seale?


471
0:35:38,959 --> 0:35:44,667
- Well, I--I can't really say,
you know, that he did.


472
0:35:44,667 --> 0:35:47,292
- Can you tell us who else
was in the waiting room


473
0:35:47,292 --> 0:35:48,542
while you were there?


474
0:35:48,542 --> 0:35:50,667
- Let me see.


475
0:35:50,667 --> 0:35:53,625
There was just one young man
there when I went in.


476
0:35:53,625 --> 0:35:54,959
I think he was in pain,


477
0:35:54,959 --> 0:35:56,709
because he was muttering
to himself


478
0:35:56,709 --> 0:35:58,542
and looking quite wild.


479
0:35:58,542 --> 0:36:1,459
And then suddenly he jumped up
and went out.


480
0:36:1,459 --> 0:36:4,84
- And he was the only other
patient that you noticed?


481
0:36:4,84 --> 0:36:8,334
- A gentleman came
down the stairs and went out


482
0:36:8,334 --> 0:36:11,42
just as I went up to Mr. Morley.


483
0:36:11,42 --> 0:36:14,167
Oh, and I remember
a very peculiar foreigner


484
0:36:14,167 --> 0:36:18,709
came out of the house
just as I arrived.


485
0:36:18,709 --> 0:36:23,542
- That was I, madame.


486
0:36:23,542 --> 0:36:25,167
- Oh.


487
0:36:25,167 --> 0:36:27,292
Oh, dear.


488
0:36:27,292 --> 0:36:28,834
Oh, do forgive me.


489
0:36:28,834 --> 0:36:30,417
Oh.
Oh.


490
0:36:30,417 --> 0:36:32,25
The light in here is so dim.


491
0:36:32,25 --> 0:36:34,459
- Please calm yourself, madame.


492
0:36:34,459 --> 0:36:37,42
- Well, I think
that's about all,


493
0:36:37,42 --> 0:36:38,584
Miss Sainsbury Seale.


494
0:36:38,584 --> 0:36:40,84
We may require you
to give evidence


495
0:36:40,84 --> 0:36:41,625
at the inquest, of course.


496
0:36:41,625 --> 0:36:43,84
- Oh, no!


497
0:36:43,84 --> 0:36:44,959
I would be so nervous.


498
0:36:44,959 --> 0:36:47,417
- Well, no need to be nervous,
madam.


499
0:36:47,417 --> 0:36:49,792
Just stand up and speak clearly.


500
0:36:49,792 --> 0:36:51,42
- Oh!


501
0:36:51,42 --> 0:36:53,167
That's very amusing,
Chief Inspector.


502
0:36:53,167 --> 0:36:54,667
- Is it?


503
0:36:54,667 --> 0:36:56,667
- I used to be an actress.


504
0:36:56,667 --> 0:36:58,875
Just small parts, you know.


505
0:36:58,875 --> 0:37:1,334
Then I went on a world tour--


506
0:37:1,334 --> 0:37:5,959
- Yes, well...


507
0:37:5,959 --> 0:37:9,0
- Well, if my name should be
in the papers--


508
0:37:9,0 --> 0:37:11,167
as a witness at the inquest,
I mean--


509
0:37:11,167 --> 0:37:14,167
you will be sure that it's
spelled right, won't you?


510
0:37:14,167 --> 0:37:17,792
Miss Mabelle Sainsbury Seale.


511
0:37:17,792 --> 0:37:28,375
Mabelle spelled M-a-b-e-I-I-e.


512
0:37:28,375 --> 0:37:36,42
- Blimey.


513
0:37:36,42 --> 0:37:37,959
- I can only give you
a few moments,


514
0:37:37,959 --> 0:37:40,375
I'm afraid, Mr. Poirot.


515
0:37:40,375 --> 0:37:43,0
I'm going to see Traviata
at Covent Garden.


516
0:37:43,0 --> 0:37:51,292
- Ah.
Thank you, Monsieur Arnholt.


517
0:37:51,292 --> 0:37:53,417
- What's this all about?


518
0:37:53,417 --> 0:37:57,667
- It is about the death of the
dentist Monsieur Henry Morley.


519
0:37:57,667 --> 0:37:59,167
It was you, was it not,


520
0:37:59,167 --> 0:38:0,792
who recommended him
to Monsieur Blunt?


521
0:38:0,792 --> 0:38:4,0
- Yes, I've been going to him
for years.


522
0:38:4,0 --> 0:38:5,917
You don't think I killed him,
do you?


523
0:38:5,917 --> 0:38:7,667
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.


524
0:38:7,667 --> 0:38:9,792
Quelle idée.
No.


525
0:38:9,792 --> 0:38:11,667
It is just that I'm given
to wonder


526
0:38:11,667 --> 0:38:15,84
whether Monsieur Blunt was not
perhaps the intended victim.


527
0:38:15,84 --> 0:38:17,584
- I don't quite see
how that works.


528
0:38:17,584 --> 0:38:18,75
- No.


529
0:38:18,75 --> 0:38:21,584
At this moment,
Monsieur Arnholt, neither do I.


530
0:38:21,584 --> 0:38:23,959
One grips at the straws.


531
0:38:23,959 --> 0:38:27,0
But tell me, Madame Olivera,


532
0:38:27,0 --> 0:38:28,875
the sister-in-law
to Monsieur Blunt,


533
0:38:28,875 --> 0:38:32,0
she is une dame formidable,
n'est-ce pas?


534
0:38:32,0 --> 0:38:33,834
- Oh, indeed.


535
0:38:33,834 --> 0:38:35,334
- How did Madame Olivera take


536
0:38:35,334 --> 0:38:38,0
to Monsieur Blunt marrying
her sister?


537
0:38:38,0 --> 0:38:39,834
I mean, after all,


538
0:38:39,834 --> 0:38:41,75
he was a mere employee
of the family business.


539
0:38:41,75 --> 0:38:43,25
- I don't know about "mere."


540
0:38:43,25 --> 0:38:47,0
Alistair was head of our
overseas investments department.


541
0:38:47,0 --> 0:38:48,84
- Ah.


542
0:38:48,84 --> 0:38:50,959
- But I don't think Aunt Julia
looked at it like that anyway.


543
0:38:50,959 --> 0:38:54,959
They were so obviously
crazy about each other.


544
0:38:54,959 --> 0:38:57,709
Nobody, of course, knew,
but she was already suffering


545
0:38:57,709 --> 0:39:0,375
from the disease that killed her
four years later.


546
0:39:0,375 --> 0:39:2,917
- A tragedy.


547
0:39:2,917 --> 0:39:6,959
- Yes.


548
0:39:6,959 --> 0:39:8,875
- Pardon.


549
0:39:8,875 --> 0:39:13,625
I must detain you no longer
from your Monsieur Verdi.


550
0:39:13,625 --> 0:39:17,167
Monsieur Arnholt, I thank you
very much for your patience,


551
0:39:17,167 --> 0:39:20,125
and I hope that you enjoy
the opera.


552
0:39:20,125 --> 0:39:58,375
- Thank you.


553
0:39:58,375 --> 0:40:0,167
- I formed the opinion


554
0:40:0,167 --> 0:40:3,125
that Mr. Amberiotis died
of heart failure


555
0:40:3,125 --> 0:40:5,0
caused by a large overdose


556
0:40:5,0 --> 0:40:9,334
of a novocaine and adrenaline
mixture.


557
0:40:9,334 --> 0:40:12,917
- The dentist who treated
Mr. Amberiotis earlier


558
0:40:12,917 --> 0:40:14,542
on the day of his death


559
0:40:14,542 --> 0:40:17,542
is now himself dead,
I understand.


560
0:40:17,542 --> 0:40:19,375
- So I understand, sir.


561
0:40:19,375 --> 0:40:22,75
- Thank you, Dr. Bennett.


562
0:40:22,75 --> 0:40:25,84
- Thank you.


563
0:40:25,84 --> 0:40:28,792
- Well, there doesn't seem
much doubt, gentlemen,


564
0:40:28,792 --> 0:40:31,25
that this is a case
of accidental death,


565
0:40:31,25 --> 0:40:33,584
a very unfortunate case.


566
0:40:33,584 --> 0:40:38,542
Did Mr. Morley
accidentally give his patient


567
0:40:38,542 --> 0:40:42,542
too large a dose
of the anesthetic?


568
0:40:42,542 --> 0:40:48,292
Or did Mr. Amberiotis have
an unusual reaction to it?


569
0:40:48,292 --> 0:40:52,875
Since Mr. Morley
is now himself dead,


570
0:40:52,875 --> 0:40:57,334
we shall never have the answer
to this.


571
0:40:57,334 --> 0:41:1,334
Nevertheless, it is your duty,
of course,


572
0:41:1,334 --> 0:41:5,292
gentlemen of the jury,
to consider all possibilities


573
0:41:5,292 --> 0:41:8,125
before you arrive
at your verdict.


574
0:41:8,125 --> 0:41:23,709
But I must remind you
that before...


575
0:41:23,709 --> 0:41:26,792
- Nobody's seen hide nor hair
of Miss Sainsbury Seale


576
0:41:26,792 --> 0:41:28,542
since Tuesday.


577
0:41:28,542 --> 0:41:32,792
Such a nice type of woman,
and she seemed so happy here.


578
0:41:32,792 --> 0:41:34,709
- I wouldn't have bothered you
with this, sir,


579
0:41:34,709 --> 0:41:37,0
but I remember she'd been
a witness in that other case.


580
0:41:37,0 --> 0:41:42,542
- No, quite right, Beddoes.


581
0:41:42,542 --> 0:41:48,959
Why should she disappear?


582
0:41:48,959 --> 0:41:52,334
- It is curious, you admit?


583
0:41:52,334 --> 0:41:55,125
- There was nothing funny
about her, you know?


584
0:41:55,125 --> 0:41:56,917
A cable to Calcutta.


585
0:41:56,917 --> 0:41:59,292
Got the reply back last night.


586
0:41:59,292 --> 0:42:3,334
She went out there as an actress
and then took to good works.


587
0:42:3,334 --> 0:42:6,792
Got hand in glove with
the missionaries, apparently.


588
0:42:6,792 --> 0:42:9,0
What I call a terrible woman


589
0:42:9,0 --> 0:42:13,667
but definitely not the type
to get mixed up in a murder.


590
0:42:13,667 --> 0:42:16,292
You got anything?


591
0:42:16,292 --> 0:42:17,667
- Stockings.


592
0:42:17,667 --> 0:42:21,42
Ten-inch, cheap silk.


593
0:42:21,42 --> 0:42:25,542
Price: probably 2 shillings
and 11 pence.


594
0:42:25,542 --> 0:42:40,792
- You're not valuing
for probate, Poirot.


595
0:42:40,792 --> 0:42:43,334
- Mr. Poirot.


596
0:42:43,334 --> 0:42:45,84
- Mademoiselle Neville.


597
0:42:45,84 --> 0:42:47,125
What a pleasant surprise.


598
0:42:47,125 --> 0:42:49,42
- I'm so sorry to worry you
like this,


599
0:42:49,42 --> 0:42:50,834
but I had to see you.


600
0:42:50,834 --> 0:42:54,292
I was very upset by the inquest
this morning.


601
0:42:54,292 --> 0:42:56,959
It couldn't happen
the way they said it did--


602
0:42:56,959 --> 0:42:59,875
giving a patient an overdose,
I mean.


603
0:42:59,875 --> 0:43:1,417
The dentists get into the habit


604
0:43:1,417 --> 0:43:4,42
of giving the regulation amount
automatically.


605
0:43:4,42 --> 0:43:6,375
- But you did not say this
in the coroner's court.


606
0:43:6,375 --> 0:43:9,917
- I was afraid
of making things worse.


607
0:43:9,917 --> 0:43:12,0
People might think
he did it deliberately.


608
0:43:12,0 --> 0:43:14,417
- I see.


609
0:43:14,417 --> 0:43:16,875
Shall we discuss this further?


610
0:43:16,875 --> 0:43:29,209
Come.


611
0:43:29,209 --> 0:43:31,625
I should like to know
a little bit more


612
0:43:31,625 --> 0:43:35,292
about the telegram you received
calling you away on that day.


613
0:43:35,292 --> 0:43:38,417
Do you yourself have any ideas
on the subject?


614
0:43:38,417 --> 0:43:42,709
- Not really.


615
0:43:42,709 --> 0:43:45,0
Frank, my friend,


616
0:43:45,0 --> 0:43:48,0
accused me of wanting to go off
for the day with somebody else.


617
0:43:48,0 --> 0:43:49,709
- Oh!


618
0:43:49,709 --> 0:43:52,584
- He's been very moody
and suspicious lately.


619
0:43:52,584 --> 0:43:54,42
Just losing his job


620
0:43:54,42 --> 0:43:56,42
and not being able
to get another one, I suppose.


621
0:43:56,42 --> 0:43:57,834
- And he was upset, was he not,
to discover


622
0:43:57,834 --> 0:43:59,209
that you had gone away
on that day?


623
0:43:59,209 --> 0:44:0,292
- Yes.


624
0:44:0,292 --> 0:44:1,709
You see, he'd come round
to tell me


625
0:44:1,709 --> 0:44:3,417
how he'd got
this marvelous new job,


626
0:44:3,417 --> 0:44:4,834
£10 a week.


627
0:44:4,834 --> 0:44:6,0
- Ooh.


628
0:44:6,0 --> 0:44:9,25
- He wanted me to know
right away.


629
0:44:9,25 --> 0:44:11,84
- And what is it,
this new job?


630
0:44:11,84 --> 0:44:14,917
- Oh, well, I don't know
all the details.


631
0:44:14,917 --> 0:44:17,125
Some government department.


632
0:44:17,125 --> 0:44:19,584
I have to write
to his London address,


633
0:44:19,584 --> 0:44:20,917
and the letters get forwarded.


634
0:44:20,917 --> 0:44:22,209
- Oh, la.


635
0:44:22,209 --> 0:44:25,334
Does that not seem to you
to be a little strange?


636
0:44:25,334 --> 0:44:26,917
- Well, I thought so,


637
0:44:26,917 --> 0:44:32,792
but Frank says
it's often done nowadays.


638
0:44:32,792 --> 0:44:36,667
- I should like to meet this
friend of yours, mademoiselle.


639
0:44:36,667 --> 0:44:38,417
- His only free day is Sunday.


640
0:44:38,417 --> 0:44:40,375
He's away in the country
all week.


641
0:44:40,375 --> 0:44:54,667
- Eh bien, tomorrow is Sunday.


642
0:44:54,667 --> 0:44:56,584
- I'm fed up with 'earing
about Morley's death,


643
0:44:56,584 --> 0:44:58,42
to be quite honest.


644
0:44:58,42 --> 0:45:0,84
There wasn't anything
so wonderful about him


645
0:45:0,84 --> 0:45:2,0
that I could see.


646
0:45:2,0 --> 0:45:3,917
- Tell me, Monsieur Carter,


647
0:45:3,917 --> 0:45:8,375
why were you in Harley Street
that day?


648
0:45:8,375 --> 0:45:13,667
I saw you there
in the waiting room.


649
0:45:13,667 --> 0:45:15,75
- All right.


650
0:45:15,75 --> 0:45:17,125
I was gonna tell Morley


651
0:45:17,125 --> 0:45:19,334
that this business
of putting Gladys against me


652
0:45:19,334 --> 0:45:22,84
had gone on long enough,
that I'd landed a good job,


653
0:45:22,84 --> 0:45:24,209
and that it was about time
she handed in her notice


654
0:45:24,209 --> 0:45:25,667
a thought about a trousseau.


655
0:45:25,667 --> 0:45:28,417
- But you did not actually
tell him these things?


656
0:45:28,417 --> 0:45:31,417
- I got fed up with waiting
in that dingy mausoleum,


657
0:45:31,417 --> 0:45:32,792
so I left.


658
0:45:32,792 --> 0:45:34,542
- At what time did you leave?


659
0:45:34,542 --> 0:45:38,959
- I can't remember.


660
0:45:38,959 --> 0:45:42,542
I've got to get going;
the march will be starting soon.


661
0:45:42,542 --> 0:45:47,917
- It has been a great pleasure
to meet you, Monsieur Carter.


662
0:45:47,917 --> 0:45:52,917
And, yes, I am delighted
to hear about your new job.


663
0:45:52,917 --> 0:45:56,5
The work, it is interesting,
n'est-ce pas?


664
0:45:56,5 --> 0:45:58,417
- Oh, yeah.


665
0:45:58,417 --> 0:46:0,292
You know.


666
0:46:0,292 --> 0:46:3,167
I'll see you next week, Gladys.


667
0:46:3,167 --> 0:46:4,209
- Bye, Frank.


668
0:46:4,209 --> 0:46:30,625
- Au revoir, Monsieur Carter.


669
0:46:30,625 --> 0:46:33,42
Are you receiving visitors,
mon ami?


670
0:46:33,42 --> 0:46:34,834
- Good heavens.
Poirot.


671
0:46:34,834 --> 0:46:36,0
- Chief Inspector.


672
0:46:36,0 --> 0:46:37,584
- What on Earth brings you
to Isleworth


673
0:46:37,584 --> 0:46:38,75
on a Sunday afternoon?


674
0:46:38,75 --> 0:46:40,375
- Business.
What else?


675
0:46:40,375 --> 0:46:42,75
- Well, you better come inside
and have a cup of tea.


676
0:46:42,75 --> 0:46:51,542
- Thank you.


677
0:46:51,542 --> 0:46:54,125
- Madame Japp,
she is not at home?


678
0:46:54,125 --> 0:46:55,5
- No, no.


679
0:46:55,5 --> 0:46:57,584
Some blessed meeting.


680
0:46:57,584 --> 0:47:0,917
Women's institute,
parish counsel, or something.


681
0:47:0,917 --> 0:47:3,292
I don't know.


682
0:47:3,292 --> 0:47:6,84
Do you take sugar, Poirot?


683
0:47:6,84 --> 0:47:8,0
- Do you have perhaps a tisane?


684
0:47:8,0 --> 0:47:9,334
- Come off it, Poirot.


685
0:47:9,334 --> 0:47:16,542
This is Isleworth, you know,
not Juan-les-Pins.


686
0:47:16,542 --> 0:47:18,959
What's the business, anyway?


687
0:47:18,959 --> 0:47:21,584
- I wondered if you'd been able
to trace the telegram


688
0:47:21,584 --> 0:47:24,125
that was sent
to Mademoiselle Gladys Neville.


689
0:47:24,125 --> 0:47:26,25
- Yes, we did,
as a matter of fact.


690
0:47:26,25 --> 0:47:29,125
Rather clever.


691
0:47:29,125 --> 0:47:32,167
The aunt lives in Richmond
in Yorkshire.


692
0:47:32,167 --> 0:47:34,834
The telegram was handed in
in Richmond, Surrey,


693
0:47:34,834 --> 0:47:36,834
just down the road here.


694
0:47:36,834 --> 0:47:38,834
- Do you know what I think,
Chief Inspector?


695
0:47:38,834 --> 0:47:45,84
- What's that?


696
0:47:45,84 --> 0:47:49,0
- I think that there are signs
of brains in this business.


697
0:47:49,0 --> 0:47:51,834
- Well, the assistant
commissioner is satisfied


698
0:47:51,834 --> 0:47:53,25
that Morley killed himself.


699
0:47:53,25 --> 0:47:55,625
- Is he satisfied
with the disappearing lady?


700
0:47:55,625 --> 0:47:59,75
- Ah, the case
of the disappearing Seale.


701
0:47:59,75 --> 0:48:1,292
No.


702
0:48:1,292 --> 0:48:3,709
I'm still working on that.


703
0:48:3,709 --> 0:48:7,167
She's got to be somewhere.


704
0:48:7,167 --> 0:48:15,375
Mm.
Garibaldi?


705
0:48:15,375 --> 0:48:18,84
- And I really think my feelings
ought to be considered


706
0:48:18,84 --> 0:48:19,584
in the matter, Alistair.


707
0:48:19,584 --> 0:48:21,667
- But your feelings
have been considered, Mother.


708
0:48:21,667 --> 0:48:25,459
- Yes, Julia, that is true.


709
0:48:25,459 --> 0:48:27,375
- Mr. Poirot to see you,
Mr. Blunt.


710
0:48:27,375 --> 0:48:28,834
- Thank you, Helen.


711
0:48:28,834 --> 0:48:30,875
Monsieur Poirot,
it's very good of you to come.


712
0:48:30,875 --> 0:48:31,959
- Monsieur Blunt.


713
0:48:31,959 --> 0:48:34,625
- Well!


714
0:48:34,625 --> 0:48:37,42
If you are going
to talk horrors,


715
0:48:37,42 --> 0:48:40,959
I shall leave.


716
0:48:40,959 --> 0:48:42,375
- Allow me.


717
0:48:42,375 --> 0:48:45,84
- I'll see you at home, Jane.


718
0:48:45,84 --> 0:48:48,42
- Madame.


719
0:48:48,42 --> 0:48:51,209
- You've met Miss Olivera,
I think.


720
0:48:51,209 --> 0:48:53,0
- Oh, yes, indeed.
Mademoiselle.


721
0:48:53,0 --> 0:48:54,75
- Please.
- Thank you.


722
0:48:54,75 --> 0:48:56,5
- I hope
I haven't asked you here


723
0:48:56,5 --> 0:48:58,959
on a wild goose chase,
Mr. Poirot.


724
0:48:58,959 --> 0:49:1,834
It's about this missing woman
that the papers are full of,


725
0:49:1,834 --> 0:49:3,292
Miss Sainsbury Seale.


726
0:49:3,292 --> 0:49:5,167
- Yes.
- Jane?


727
0:49:5,167 --> 0:49:7,709
I'm sure
this is utterly unimportant.


728
0:49:7,709 --> 0:49:10,0
And why we are wasting
Mr. Poirot's time,


729
0:49:10,0 --> 0:49:11,125
I really don't know.


730
0:49:11,125 --> 0:49:14,25
- If you please, Mr. Blunt,
allow Poirot to decide.


731
0:49:14,25 --> 0:49:17,42
- Well, Sainsbury Seale
is such a pompous name.


732
0:49:17,42 --> 0:49:18,75
That's why I remembered.


733
0:49:18,75 --> 0:49:19,875
It was the last time


734
0:49:19,875 --> 0:49:21,75
Uncle Alistair went
to the dentist.


735
0:49:21,75 --> 0:49:23,84
Well, I don't mean
the other day;


736
0:49:23,84 --> 0:49:24,667
I mean about a week ago.


737
0:49:24,667 --> 0:49:27,834
I was with him,
and we stopped in Harley Street,


738
0:49:27,834 --> 0:49:30,417
and just as he got out,
a woman came out of the dentist,


739
0:49:30,417 --> 0:49:33,167
a middle-aged woman
with fussy hair


740
0:49:33,167 --> 0:49:35,584
and rather dowdy clothes.


741
0:49:35,584 --> 0:49:39,792
"Oh, Mr. Blunt, you don't
remember me, I'm sure."


742
0:49:39,792 --> 0:49:41,209
- People are always saying that,


743
0:49:41,209 --> 0:49:42,709
and I never do.


744
0:49:42,709 --> 0:49:44,917
- "I was a great friend
of your wife's, you know."


745
0:49:44,917 --> 0:49:46,75
- They usually say that too.


746
0:49:46,75 --> 0:49:48,584
It always ends the same way:


747
0:49:48,584 --> 0:49:50,834
a subscription
to some charity or other.


748
0:49:50,834 --> 0:49:53,417
£5 to a zenana mission
this time.


749
0:49:53,417 --> 0:49:56,42
- And had she really known
your wife, Monsieur Blunt?


750
0:49:56,42 --> 0:49:58,42
- Well...


751
0:49:58,42 --> 0:49:59,542
the mention
of the zenana mission


752
0:49:59,542 --> 0:50:1,334
made me think she may have done.


753
0:50:1,334 --> 0:50:3,584
We were in India
about four years ago,


754
0:50:3,584 --> 0:50:5,167
just before my wife's death.


755
0:50:5,167 --> 0:50:7,417
Perhaps we met once
at a reception.


756
0:50:7,417 --> 0:50:8,917
- I think it's queer


757
0:50:8,917 --> 0:50:11,667
the way she tried to scrape
an acquaintance with you.


758
0:50:11,667 --> 0:50:16,625
- And she did not try to, um,
how do you say,


759
0:50:16,625 --> 0:50:18,125
follow it up in any way?


760
0:50:18,125 --> 0:50:19,375
- Why, no.


761
0:50:19,375 --> 0:50:20,917
I'd forgotten her name, even,


762
0:50:20,917 --> 0:50:24,5
until Jane spotted it
in the paper.


763
0:50:24,5 --> 0:50:27,459
- Well, I just thought
you ought to be told,


764
0:50:27,459 --> 0:50:35,42
Monsieur Poirot.


765
0:50:35,42 --> 0:50:37,125
- Here.


766
0:50:37,125 --> 0:50:38,75
Here, Alison?


767
0:50:38,75 --> 0:50:40,25
- What?


768
0:50:40,25 --> 0:50:43,334
- There's a thing here
about a woman who came here,


769
0:50:43,334 --> 0:50:45,834
Miss Sainsbury Seale.


770
0:50:45,834 --> 0:50:51,459
It says here she's missing.


771
0:50:51,459 --> 0:50:53,84
- You don't have a passkey?


772
0:50:53,84 --> 0:50:55,292
- No, I've never had one.


773
0:50:55,292 --> 0:50:57,42
- We can't just break in.


774
0:50:57,42 --> 0:50:59,42
- Well, suppose
something's happened to her.


775
0:50:59,42 --> 0:51:1,167
- Yes, and suppose
she's gone off on holidays.


776
0:51:1,167 --> 0:51:3,875
- Oh, no.
Oh, no.


777
0:51:3,875 --> 0:51:8,75
- Go on, Sergeant.


778
0:51:8,75 --> 0:51:28,417
Right.


779
0:51:28,417 --> 0:51:29,584
- Mrs. Chapman!


780
0:51:29,584 --> 0:51:32,625
- Leave it to us.


781
0:51:32,625 --> 0:51:37,459
Mrs. Chapman!


782
0:51:37,459 --> 0:51:47,292
- Sergeant.


783
0:51:47,292 --> 0:51:52,625
Hello?


784
0:51:52,625 --> 0:51:58,5
Anybody there?


785
0:51:58,5 --> 0:52:4,792
Mrs. Chapman?


786
0:52:4,792 --> 0:52:14,334
Hello?


787
0:52:14,334 --> 0:52:27,375
Anybody here?


788
0:52:27,375 --> 0:52:32,459
- This is the boxroom.


789
0:52:32,459 --> 0:52:33,875
- What's that?


790
0:52:33,875 --> 0:52:40,709
- Well, I don't know.


791
0:52:40,709 --> 0:52:43,417
- Shall I open it, Sarge?


792
0:52:43,417 --> 0:53:25,125
- Go on, then.


793
0:53:25,125 --> 0:53:38,5
It's not particularly pleasant.


794
0:53:38,5 --> 0:53:41,0
- That's the porter
being sick, sir.


795
0:53:41,0 --> 0:53:43,459
I had to get him to have
another look at the body


796
0:53:43,459 --> 0:54:4,334
to identify it.


797
0:54:4,334 --> 0:54:23,417
- There's some brandy
in the other room.


798
0:54:23,417 --> 0:54:34,84
- It was not pretty, that.


799
0:54:34,84 --> 0:54:36,834
Tell me all about it,
Chief Inspector.


800
0:54:36,834 --> 0:54:41,209
- The flat belongs
to a Mrs. Albert Chapman.


801
0:54:41,209 --> 0:54:43,334
Can't tell you much about her,
really.


802
0:54:43,334 --> 0:54:44,875
Pays her bills.


803
0:54:44,875 --> 0:54:46,709
Fond of a game of bridge.


804
0:54:46,709 --> 0:54:50,917
Keeps herself to herself
more or less.


805
0:54:50,917 --> 0:54:54,417
The neighbors say they've hardly
ever seen her, in fact.


806
0:54:54,417 --> 0:54:57,209
Mr. Chapman's a commercial
traveler, apparently,


807
0:54:57,209 --> 0:55:0,875
so he spends most of his time
away from home.


808
0:55:0,875 --> 0:55:3,417
- And Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale?


809
0:55:3,417 --> 0:55:6,792
- She came here on the evening
of our interview with her,


810
0:55:6,792 --> 0:55:9,0
about 7:15.


811
0:55:9,0 --> 0:55:11,42
The porter's wife
was cleaning up here


812
0:55:11,42 --> 0:55:12,417
and saw her arrive.


813
0:55:12,417 --> 0:55:16,667
She'd been here once before,
the porter says.


814
0:55:16,667 --> 0:55:18,334
Now, one thing's for certain:


815
0:55:18,334 --> 0:55:21,542
Sylvia Chapman
or Sylvia's friends


816
0:55:21,542 --> 0:55:24,25
murdered the lady, put her
in the box, and made off.


817
0:55:24,25 --> 0:55:26,875
- But why was the face
so battered?


818
0:55:26,875 --> 0:55:28,834
- Sheer vindictiveness, maybe.


819
0:55:28,834 --> 0:55:30,375
Or it may have been
with the idea


820
0:55:30,375 --> 0:55:32,25
of concealing
the woman's identity.


821
0:55:32,25 --> 0:55:36,875
I don't know.


822
0:55:36,875 --> 0:55:40,25
No fingerprints anywhere,
as far as we can see.


823
0:55:40,25 --> 0:55:42,667
- You mean every fingerprint
in the apartment


824
0:55:42,667 --> 0:55:44,417
was removed after the murder?


825
0:55:44,417 --> 0:56:27,834
- That's about the size of it.


826
0:56:27,834 --> 0:56:32,75
Something worrying you, Poirot?


827
0:56:32,75 --> 0:56:36,834
Yes.


828
0:56:36,834 --> 0:56:58,625
Yes, I'm very seriously worried.


829
0:56:58,625 --> 0:57:5,42
There is here, you see,
an insoluble problem.


830
0:57:5,42 --> 0:57:8,542
- One patent leather shoe,
complete with buckle.


831
0:57:8,542 --> 0:57:9,625
What's wrong with that?


832
0:57:9,625 --> 0:57:11,917
- Nothing.


833
0:57:11,917 --> 0:57:17,209
Absolutely nothing.


834
0:57:17,209 --> 0:57:28,459
All the same,
I do not understand.


835
0:57:28,459 --> 0:57:33,667
Some bearers
belonging to Madame Chapman.


836
0:57:33,667 --> 0:57:36,75
Ah.


837
0:57:36,75 --> 0:57:45,709
Some old theater programs.


838
0:57:45,709 --> 0:57:47,875
A leaflet
about the zenana missions.


839
0:57:47,875 --> 0:57:53,167
- We can guess
who brought that here.


840
0:57:53,167 --> 0:57:56,167
- Nothing much of interest
in the address book either, sir.


841
0:57:56,167 --> 0:57:59,84
- No, so I see.


842
0:57:59,84 --> 0:58:0,834
Hairdressers.


843
0:58:0,834 --> 0:58:3,834
Dressmakers.


844
0:58:3,834 --> 0:58:5,25
A dentist.


845
0:58:5,25 --> 0:58:8,709
Morley, 168 Harley Street.


846
0:58:8,709 --> 0:58:10,25
- Not so strange


847
0:58:10,25 --> 0:58:36,709
if she was a friend
of the Sainsbury Seale woman.


848
0:58:36,709 --> 0:58:38,375
Pardon.


849
0:58:38,375 --> 0:58:41,167
- Mr. Poirot?


850
0:58:41,167 --> 0:58:43,42
What brings you here?


851
0:58:43,42 --> 0:58:45,417
- Tell me, if you please,


852
0:58:45,417 --> 0:58:49,84
did your brother ever mention
to you in particular


853
0:58:49,84 --> 0:58:52,334
a Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
or a Madame Chapman?


854
0:58:52,334 --> 0:58:54,209
- No.


855
0:58:54,209 --> 0:58:56,125
No, I don't think so.


856
0:58:56,125 --> 0:58:57,292
- I managed to make this


857
0:58:57,292 --> 0:58:59,84
before they took everything,
Miss Morley.


858
0:58:59,84 --> 0:59:0,459
- Oh, thank you, Agnes.


859
0:59:0,459 --> 0:59:2,625
Would you like a cup, sir?


860
0:59:2,625 --> 0:59:6,417
- Not for me, Agnes.
Thank you very much.


861
0:59:6,417 --> 0:59:9,209
- Agnes is coming with me
to the country.


862
0:59:9,209 --> 0:59:11,292
She's becoming
quite a good little cook,


863
0:59:11,292 --> 0:59:28,542
so she'll be able
to do everything for me.


864
0:59:28,542 --> 0:59:30,375
- Excuse me, sir...
- Yes.


865
0:59:30,375 --> 0:59:32,875
- For asking.
- Yes.


866
0:59:32,875 --> 0:59:34,334
- But does anyone know
anything more


867
0:59:34,334 --> 0:59:36,125
about the master's death, sir?


868
0:59:36,125 --> 0:59:38,709
- Nothing fresh
has come to light, Agnes.


869
0:59:38,709 --> 0:59:40,459
- They're still quite sure
he shot himself


870
0:59:40,459 --> 0:59:42,5
because he'd made a mistake
with that drug.


871
0:59:42,5 --> 0:59:44,709
- Yes.


872
0:59:44,709 --> 0:59:45,792
Why do you ask?


873
0:59:45,792 --> 0:59:47,792
- I only--
- Agnes?


874
0:59:47,792 --> 0:59:50,42
- I just want to be sure, sir.


875
0:59:50,42 --> 1:0:16,75
- Agnes!


876
1:0:16,75 --> 1:0:18,917
- Ah, Chief Inspector.
- No time, Poirot.


877
1:0:18,917 --> 1:0:20,459
We found
Mr. and Mrs. Albert Chapman.


878
1:0:20,459 --> 1:0:21,792
- Where?


879
1:0:21,792 --> 1:0:23,917
- They booked into the
Montague Hotel this morning.


880
1:0:23,917 --> 1:0:25,375
- The Montague Hotel,
Bloomsbury?


881
1:0:25,375 --> 1:0:26,459
- That's right.


882
1:0:26,459 --> 1:0:27,917
- It is odd, is it not,


883
1:0:27,917 --> 1:0:30,625
being on the run after murdering
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale,


884
1:0:30,625 --> 1:0:32,417
that they have not run further?


885
1:0:32,417 --> 1:0:43,167
- You never can tell
with the criminal mind, Poirot.


886
1:0:43,167 --> 1:0:45,625
- Open up!


887
1:0:45,625 --> 1:0:46,75
- Who is it?


888
1:0:46,75 --> 1:0:48,584
- Police.


889
1:0:48,584 --> 1:0:49,959
- Police?


890
1:0:49,959 --> 1:0:55,584
- Just open the door,
Mr. Chapman.


891
1:0:55,584 --> 1:0:57,84
- Here!


892
1:0:57,84 --> 1:0:59,334
- All right, there's no need
for anyone to get hurt.


893
1:0:59,334 --> 1:1:2,42
You are Mr. Albert Chapman?


894
1:1:2,42 --> 1:1:3,209
- Yes.


895
1:1:3,209 --> 1:1:6,292
- And this is Mrs. Chapman?


896
1:1:6,292 --> 1:1:8,209
- Yes.


897
1:1:8,209 --> 1:1:9,542
What's the meaning of this?


898
1:1:9,542 --> 1:1:11,25
- I'll ask the questions, sir.


899
1:1:11,25 --> 1:1:13,209
Do you live
at number 45 Lichfield Court


900
1:1:13,209 --> 1:1:14,459
in Battersea in the--


901
1:1:14,459 --> 1:1:15,792
- No.


902
1:1:15,792 --> 1:1:17,25
- What do you mean, "no"?


903
1:1:17,25 --> 1:1:19,959
- Well, we don't.


904
1:1:19,959 --> 1:1:21,584
Do we, Beryl?


905
1:1:21,584 --> 1:1:22,917
- Beryl?


906
1:1:22,917 --> 1:1:25,334
- What's wrong with "Beryl"?


907
1:1:25,334 --> 1:1:28,792
We happen to know that your name
is Sylvia, Mrs. Chapman.


908
1:1:28,792 --> 1:1:30,542
- What are you talking about?


909
1:1:30,542 --> 1:1:32,667
- We live in Budleigh Salterton,


910
1:1:32,667 --> 1:1:35,834
not this...Lichfield place.


911
1:1:35,834 --> 1:1:37,917
- You have proof of that,
I suppose.


912
1:1:37,917 --> 1:1:39,542
- Well, no, I haven't--


913
1:1:39,542 --> 1:1:41,792
Yes, I have.


914
1:1:41,792 --> 1:1:50,125
- Watch him, Beddoes.


915
1:1:50,125 --> 1:1:52,334
What's this?


916
1:1:52,334 --> 1:1:54,959
- Our wedding lines,
if you must know.


917
1:1:54,959 --> 1:3:12,125
- We were married this morning.


918
1:3:12,125 --> 1:3:14,209
- I swear by almighty God


919
1:3:14,209 --> 1:3:16,292
that the evidence I shall give


920
1:3:16,292 --> 1:3:18,834
shall be the truth,
the whole truth,


921
1:3:18,834 --> 1:3:23,375
and nothing but the truth.


922
1:3:23,375 --> 1:3:26,417
- You are Mr. John Leatheran?


923
1:3:26,417 --> 1:3:27,5
- Yes, sir.


924
1:3:27,5 --> 1:3:29,209
- And you are a dentist.


925
1:3:29,209 --> 1:3:30,834
- Yes, sir.


926
1:3:30,834 --> 1:3:32,375
I've taken over
the dental practice


927
1:3:32,375 --> 1:3:35,209
of the late Mr. Henry Morley
at 168 Harley Street.


928
1:3:35,209 --> 1:3:37,5
- I see.


929
1:3:37,5 --> 1:3:39,25
You were recently called


930
1:3:39,25 --> 1:3:41,459
to examine the body
of the deceased


931
1:3:41,459 --> 1:3:46,334
for purposes of identification.


932
1:3:46,334 --> 1:3:47,417
Were you not?


933
1:3:47,417 --> 1:3:49,125
- I was, sir.


934
1:3:49,125 --> 1:3:50,5
The police believed the body


935
1:3:50,5 --> 1:3:52,959
to be that of
Miss Mabelle Sainsbury Seale,


936
1:3:52,959 --> 1:3:54,459
who was a patient
of Mr. Morley's.


937
1:3:54,459 --> 1:3:56,84
- I see.


938
1:3:56,84 --> 1:4:0,667
You've inherited, as it were,
the late Mr. Morley's patients.


939
1:4:0,667 --> 1:4:1,834
- That's right, sir.


940
1:4:1,834 --> 1:4:3,5
- And, of course,
their dental records.


941
1:4:3,5 --> 1:4:4,792
- Quite.


942
1:4:4,792 --> 1:4:8,542
- And could you identify
the body from these records?


943
1:4:8,542 --> 1:4:9,917
- I could, sir.


944
1:4:9,917 --> 1:4:12,167
It was not Miss Sainsbury Seale.


945
1:4:12,167 --> 1:4:30,125
It was Mrs. Sylvia Chapman,
another patient of Mr. Morley's.


946
1:4:30,125 --> 1:4:32,25
- The fair Mabelle
put one over on us


947
1:4:32,25 --> 1:4:33,625
good and proper.


948
1:4:33,625 --> 1:4:36,84
I wouldn't have thought
she was capable of murder,


949
1:4:36,84 --> 1:4:37,625
but that's what it looks like
now.


950
1:4:37,625 --> 1:4:41,625
Sylvia didn't murder Mabelle;
Mabelle murdered Sylvia.


951
1:4:41,625 --> 1:4:43,375
- Perhaps.


952
1:4:43,375 --> 1:4:46,459
- It crossed my mind that Morley
might have been killed


953
1:4:46,459 --> 1:4:48,459
so he couldn't identify
the body.


954
1:4:48,459 --> 1:4:50,417
- But, as you have just heard,
Chief Inspector,


955
1:4:50,417 --> 1:4:52,84
the records
would still have existed.


956
1:4:52,84 --> 1:4:54,125
- That's right.


957
1:4:54,125 --> 1:4:56,334
Anyway, I'm going back to work.


958
1:4:56,334 --> 1:4:57,792
- Oh, Chief Inspector.


959
1:4:57,792 --> 1:5:0,875
This morning, I received
a letter from Monsieur Blunt.


960
1:5:0,875 --> 1:5:3,167
He has invited me to his house
in the country.


961
1:5:3,167 --> 1:5:5,25
He may have a commission for me.


962
1:5:5,25 --> 1:5:22,167
- Well, you always did move
in exalted circles, Poirot.


963
1:5:22,167 --> 1:5:24,792
- Helen isn't dining with us
tonight?


964
1:5:24,792 --> 1:5:29,792
- I suggested that it would be
far better for her to rest


965
1:5:29,792 --> 1:5:32,375
than to go to all the bother
of dressing herself up


966
1:5:32,375 --> 1:5:33,75
and coming down.


967
1:5:33,75 --> 1:5:36,875
She saw my point.


968
1:5:36,875 --> 1:5:38,417
- Oh?


969
1:5:38,417 --> 1:5:40,542
I thought it might make
a pleasant change for her.


970
1:5:40,542 --> 1:5:44,5
- I really don't see why
you need a secretary


971
1:5:44,5 --> 1:5:48,709
during the weekend anyway.


972
1:5:48,709 --> 1:5:50,125
- She's new to the job.


973
1:5:50,125 --> 1:6:2,75
There's a lot
she needs to learn.


974
1:6:2,75 --> 1:6:7,84
Monsieur Poirot?


975
1:6:7,84 --> 1:6:8,709
There is a great deal
about which


976
1:6:8,709 --> 1:6:12,25
I am not entirely satisfied.


977
1:6:12,25 --> 1:6:16,209
- What do you want of me,
Monsieur Blunt?


978
1:6:16,209 --> 1:6:19,75
- I want you to find this woman
Sainsbury Seale.


979
1:6:19,75 --> 1:6:23,459
- Alive or dead?


980
1:6:23,459 --> 1:6:32,417
- You think she may be dead.


981
1:6:32,417 --> 1:6:34,417
- I think...


982
1:6:34,417 --> 1:6:36,5
She might be dead, yes.


983
1:6:36,5 --> 1:6:41,125
- Why do you think so?


984
1:6:41,125 --> 1:6:49,584
- Because of a pair of new
silk stockings I discovered.


985
1:6:49,584 --> 1:6:51,667
You're an odd man,
Monsieur Poirot.


986
1:6:51,667 --> 1:6:53,209
- Oh, yes, I am.


987
1:6:53,209 --> 1:6:55,542
Very odd.


988
1:6:55,542 --> 1:7:1,209
That is to say, I am methodical,
orderly, and logical,


989
1:7:1,209 --> 1:7:3,834
and I do not like
to distort facts


990
1:7:3,834 --> 1:7:42,917
to support a theory.


991
1:7:42,917 --> 1:8:19,334
Good morning.


992
1:8:19,334 --> 1:8:20,834
- Good morning, Monsieur Poirot.


993
1:8:20,834 --> 1:8:22,84
Did you sleep well?


994
1:8:22,84 --> 1:8:24,625
- Excellently.
Thank you, Monsieur Blunt.


995
1:8:24,625 --> 1:8:25,959
Good morning, mademoiselle.


996
1:8:25,959 --> 1:8:30,125
- Good morning, Mr. Poirot.


997
1:8:30,125 --> 1:8:33,25
I would prefer not to accept
any invitations, Mr. Blunt,


998
1:8:33,25 --> 1:8:42,667
while your American relations
are with you.


999
1:8:42,667 --> 1:8:44,542
- Good morning.


1000
1:8:44,542 --> 1:8:46,542
Julia.


1001
1:8:46,542 --> 1:8:48,542
I'm afraid you rather hurt
Helen's feelings.


1002
1:8:48,542 --> 1:8:50,875
- Oh, for heaven's sake,
Alistair.


1003
1:8:50,875 --> 1:8:59,42
She's only a secretary.


1004
1:8:59,42 --> 1:9:2,0
- I notice
that you have a gardener


1005
1:9:2,0 --> 1:9:5,792
who you must have employed
recently.


1006
1:9:5,792 --> 1:9:8,75
- Yes, we took one on
a couple of weeks ago.


1007
1:9:8,75 --> 1:9:11,5
- Do you know
from where he came?


1008
1:9:11,5 --> 1:9:13,292
- I'm afraid not.


1009
1:9:13,292 --> 1:9:15,542
MacAlister, the head gardener,
engaged him.


1010
1:9:15,542 --> 1:9:17,792
- Oh.
What is his name?


1011
1:9:17,792 --> 1:9:19,42
- Well, I don't know.


1012
1:9:19,42 --> 1:9:28,417
Dunning, Sunbury,
something of the sort.


1013
1:9:28,417 --> 1:9:29,917
- Seems like lots of people


1014
1:9:29,917 --> 1:9:31,709
are out for your blood,
Uncle Alistair.


1015
1:9:31,709 --> 1:9:35,25
- Oh, really?
What are you reading?


1016
1:9:35,25 --> 1:9:37,42
Oh, the debate in the House.


1017
1:9:37,42 --> 1:9:38,625
That's only Archerton.


1018
1:9:38,625 --> 1:9:40,167
If we'd let him have his way,


1019
1:9:40,167 --> 1:9:42,125
England would be bankrupt
within a week.


1020
1:9:42,125 --> 1:9:44,75
- Did you know there are
over 2 million unemployed


1021
1:9:44,75 --> 1:9:46,292
in this country?


1022
1:9:46,292 --> 1:9:49,792
- One can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs, Jane.


1023
1:9:49,792 --> 1:9:52,709
- I think we do pretty well,
all things considered.


1024
1:9:52,709 --> 1:9:55,167
Industrial production
was up 3% last year.


1025
1:9:55,167 --> 1:9:59,42
- Take no notice
of what Jane says.


1026
1:9:59,42 --> 1:10:1,167
You know what girls are.


1027
1:10:1,167 --> 1:10:4,209
They go to these parties
in studios,


1028
1:10:4,209 --> 1:10:6,834
and then they come home
and talk a lot of nonsense.


1029
1:10:6,834 --> 1:10:8,417
- Mother.


1030
1:10:8,417 --> 1:10:11,542
- I'm afraid I'm one of the last
of the old guard,


1031
1:10:11,542 --> 1:10:12,917
Monsieur Poirot.


1032
1:10:12,917 --> 1:10:17,25
- And if the old guard
should be removed,


1033
1:10:17,25 --> 1:10:18,584
what would happen?


1034
1:10:18,584 --> 1:10:20,75
- Removed?


1035
1:10:20,75 --> 1:10:22,417
I'll tell you.


1036
1:10:22,417 --> 1:10:23,625
A lot of damn fools


1037
1:10:23,625 --> 1:10:25,792
would try a lot
of very costly experiments.


1038
1:10:25,792 --> 1:10:27,959
It would be the end
of stability,


1039
1:10:27,959 --> 1:10:30,375
of common sense,
and of solvency.


1040
1:10:30,375 --> 1:10:42,709
- Ah.


1041
1:10:42,709 --> 1:10:44,667
Of course, we've always taken
great pride


1042
1:10:44,667 --> 1:10:46,584
in our herbaceous borders here.


1043
1:10:46,584 --> 1:10:47,959
They're a lot of work, mind,


1044
1:10:47,959 --> 1:10:49,917
but well worth the effort,
I've always thought.


1045
1:10:49,917 --> 1:10:52,42
- Ah, now, these flowers here,
they are beautiful.


1046
1:10:52,42 --> 1:10:54,459
- Yes, they're particularly good
this year.


1047
1:10:54,459 --> 1:10:56,959
And look at these here.


1048
1:10:56,959 --> 1:11:0,167
Good god!


1049
1:11:0,167 --> 1:11:1,209
- Drop that gun!


1050
1:11:1,209 --> 1:11:2,334
- It wasn't me, I tell you.


1051
1:11:2,334 --> 1:11:4,542
- Oh, no? Just shooting
at the birds, I suppose.


1052
1:11:4,542 --> 1:11:6,459
Oh, Mr. Blunt!


1053
1:11:6,459 --> 1:11:8,75
I caught him right at it.


1054
1:11:8,75 --> 1:11:11,125
- I was just weeding the beds.


1055
1:11:11,125 --> 1:11:13,167
I heard a shot,
the gun fell right at my feet,


1056
1:11:13,167 --> 1:11:15,625
I picked it up, and this
stupid cow jumped on me.


1057
1:11:15,625 --> 1:11:17,375
- Now, then, Dunning, Dunbury--


1058
1:11:17,375 --> 1:11:18,459
what is your name?


1059
1:11:18,459 --> 1:11:20,542
- His name is Frank Carter.


1060
1:11:20,542 --> 1:11:22,209
- You.


1061
1:11:22,209 --> 1:11:23,792
You've had it in for me
all along.


1062
1:11:23,792 --> 1:11:25,667
I never fired that shot!


1063
1:11:25,667 --> 1:11:27,709
- In that case, who did?


1064
1:11:27,709 --> 1:11:31,42
As you can see,
there is no one else here


1065
1:11:31,42 --> 1:12:0,292
but ourselves.


1066
1:12:0,292 --> 1:12:5,167
You really must not agitate
yourself, Mademoiselle Neville.


1067
1:12:5,167 --> 1:12:6,917
- First they tried to pretend


1068
1:12:6,917 --> 1:12:9,917
that Frank attempted
to murder Mr. Blunt,


1069
1:12:9,917 --> 1:12:14,459
and now they've accused him
of murdering poor Mr. Morley.


1070
1:12:14,459 --> 1:12:15,75
- Sugar?


1071
1:12:15,75 --> 1:12:18,209
- No, thank you.


1072
1:12:18,209 --> 1:12:21,459
- I was down there, you know,
at Exsham,


1073
1:12:21,459 --> 1:12:23,5
when the shot was fired
at Monsieur Blunt.


1074
1:12:23,5 --> 1:12:26,125
- It's these Blackshirts.


1075
1:12:26,125 --> 1:12:28,584
They march around
waving their banners.


1076
1:12:28,584 --> 1:12:30,542
They have
this ridiculous salute.


1077
1:12:30,542 --> 1:12:34,25
And they work up these poor men
like Frank until they think


1078
1:12:34,25 --> 1:12:36,959
they're doing something
wonderful and patriotic.


1079
1:12:36,959 --> 1:12:39,25
- And that is the defense
of Monsieur Carter?


1080
1:12:39,25 --> 1:12:41,125
- No! I haven't seen him,
of course.


1081
1:12:41,125 --> 1:12:42,167
They wouldn't let me.


1082
1:12:42,167 --> 1:12:54,834
- Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.


1083
1:12:54,834 --> 1:12:57,792
- He has a solicitor
working for him,


1084
1:12:57,792 --> 1:13:0,25
and he told me
what Frank had said.


1085
1:13:0,25 --> 1:13:4,709
He met a man in a public house


1086
1:13:4,709 --> 1:13:7,542
who said
he was in the secret service,


1087
1:13:7,542 --> 1:13:12,459
and he offered Frank
this wonderful job.


1088
1:13:12,459 --> 1:13:16,84
He was to take up the post
of gardener


1089
1:13:16,84 --> 1:13:19,917
and listen to all the other
gardeners' conversations


1090
1:13:19,917 --> 1:13:24,167
and sound them out
as to their Red tendencies.


1091
1:13:24,167 --> 1:13:26,667
He had to pretend to be
a bit of a Red himself.


1092
1:13:26,667 --> 1:13:30,584
- And this solicitor,
he is of the opinion


1093
1:13:30,584 --> 1:13:32,0
that his client would do better


1094
1:13:32,0 --> 1:13:34,167
to think of a story
that is more plausible?


1095
1:13:34,167 --> 1:13:37,334
- Lawyers.


1096
1:13:37,334 --> 1:13:43,875
You wouldn't believe
how difficult they are.


1097
1:13:43,875 --> 1:13:46,0
- Mademoiselle Neville.


1098
1:13:46,0 --> 1:13:49,917
What did you think
of the housemaid, Agnes?


1099
1:13:49,917 --> 1:13:53,417
- I didn't think at all
about her.


1100
1:13:53,417 --> 1:13:56,375
Mr. Morley's sister
kept a strict eye on the maids.


1101
1:13:56,375 --> 1:13:57,792
- Ah.


1102
1:13:57,792 --> 1:14:0,42
- Why are you asking?


1103
1:14:0,42 --> 1:14:3,25
- She wrote to me a letter,
and...


1104
1:14:3,25 --> 1:14:23,625
As yet, I do not know why.


1105
1:14:23,625 --> 1:14:48,334
Thank you.


1106
1:14:48,334 --> 1:14:49,417
- Your tea, madam.


1107
1:14:49,417 --> 1:14:51,834
- Thank you.


1108
1:14:51,834 --> 1:14:54,834
I hope you didn't mind me
writing you that letter, sir,


1109
1:14:54,834 --> 1:14:57,917
only I didn't want for you
to come to the house.


1110
1:14:57,917 --> 1:15:1,667
I mean, if I was to say anything
in front of Miss Morley,


1111
1:15:1,667 --> 1:15:4,5
she might say as how I ought
to have said something before.


1112
1:15:4,5 --> 1:15:7,834
Me and the cook,
we'd read in the papers


1113
1:15:7,834 --> 1:15:10,125
how the master had made
a mistake with that drug


1114
1:15:10,125 --> 1:15:11,625
and had shot himself.


1115
1:15:11,625 --> 1:15:15,167
So it did seem quite clear,
didn't it, sir?


1116
1:15:15,167 --> 1:15:17,209
- When did you begin
to feel differently, Agnes?


1117
1:15:17,209 --> 1:15:21,209
- Seeing in the paper, sir,
about that Frank Carter


1118
1:15:21,209 --> 1:15:24,167
shooting at that gentleman.


1119
1:15:24,167 --> 1:15:26,792
I mean, up till then,


1120
1:15:26,792 --> 1:15:30,167
neither of us thought he'd done
anything to Mr. Morley.


1121
1:15:30,167 --> 1:15:33,959
We just thought
it was a bit queer.


1122
1:15:33,959 --> 1:15:37,42
- What was queer, Agnes?


1123
1:15:37,42 --> 1:15:39,167
- It was that morning, sir.


1124
1:15:39,167 --> 1:15:41,84
The morning
Mr. Morley shot himself.


1125
1:15:41,84 --> 1:15:45,125
I was wondering if I dared
run down and get the post,


1126
1:15:45,125 --> 1:15:46,709
so I went out on the landing,


1127
1:15:46,709 --> 1:15:51,292
and I looked down
over the stairs.


1128
1:15:51,292 --> 1:15:53,292
And it was then that I saw him,


1129
1:15:53,292 --> 1:15:56,417
Frank Carter,
down on the stairs below.


1130
1:15:56,417 --> 1:16:0,584
He was just standing there,
like, waiting.


1131
1:16:0,584 --> 1:16:2,459
Then he seemed
to make up his mind,


1132
1:16:2,459 --> 1:16:4,834
and he sort of went
very quickly down the stairs


1133
1:16:4,834 --> 1:16:7,709
towards the master's surgery.


1134
1:16:7,709 --> 1:16:12,292
And I thought to myself,
"The master won't like that."


1135
1:16:12,292 --> 1:16:14,334
- Agnes!


1136
1:16:14,334 --> 1:16:16,5
- But just then, Cook called me,


1137
1:16:16,5 --> 1:16:18,459
and I went back
into the kitchen.


1138
1:16:18,459 --> 1:16:20,834
And afterwards, I heard
the master had shot himself,


1139
1:16:20,834 --> 1:16:24,167
and it was so awful, it just
drove everything out of my head.


1140
1:16:24,167 --> 1:16:27,25
- Tell me, Agnes.


1141
1:16:27,25 --> 1:16:29,417
Did you actually see
Frank Carter


1142
1:16:29,417 --> 1:16:32,42
enter the room
of Monsieur Morley?


1143
1:16:32,42 --> 1:16:34,375
- He must have done, sir.


1144
1:16:34,375 --> 1:16:36,375
- At what time was this?


1145
1:16:36,375 --> 1:16:57,542
- It must have been
about half past 12:00, sir.


1146
1:16:57,542 --> 1:16:59,584
- I want to see Frank Carter.


1147
1:16:59,584 --> 1:17:1,834
- What's the big idea?


1148
1:17:1,834 --> 1:17:5,792
- You are unwilling?


1149
1:17:5,792 --> 1:17:8,209
- What do you want
to see Carter for?


1150
1:17:8,209 --> 1:17:10,167
Ask him
if he really murdered Morley?


1151
1:17:10,167 --> 1:17:11,625
- Yes.


1152
1:17:11,625 --> 1:17:13,834
- I suppose you think
he'll tell you if he did.


1153
1:17:13,834 --> 1:17:16,84
- He might tell me, yes.


1154
1:17:16,84 --> 1:17:18,25
- That can only mean that you've
got hold of something


1155
1:17:18,25 --> 1:17:19,917
that proves
more or less conclusively


1156
1:17:19,917 --> 1:17:21,125
that he didn't.


1157
1:17:21,125 --> 1:17:23,667
You ought to play fair
with us, Poirot.


1158
1:17:23,667 --> 1:17:27,917
- I am playing fair with you,
Chief Inspector.


1159
1:17:27,917 --> 1:17:49,0
Believe me.


1160
1:17:49,0 --> 1:17:50,292
- It's a damned lie!


1161
1:17:50,292 --> 1:17:52,42
You paid her to say that.


1162
1:17:52,42 --> 1:17:55,84
- Anger and abuse will not
help you, Monsieur Carter.


1163
1:17:55,84 --> 1:17:57,459
Agnes is going to tell
her story,


1164
1:17:57,459 --> 1:17:59,875
and it is going to be believed.


1165
1:17:59,875 --> 1:18:3,84
You were on the stairs,
Agnes did see you,


1166
1:18:3,84 --> 1:18:5,792
and you did go into the room
of Monsieur Morley.


1167
1:18:5,792 --> 1:18:8,42
What happened then?


1168
1:18:8,42 --> 1:18:15,959
- It's a lie!


1169
1:18:15,959 --> 1:18:18,709
- No.


1170
1:18:18,709 --> 1:18:24,209
It is not a lie.


1171
1:18:24,209 --> 1:18:26,959
If you did not kill
Monsieur Morley,


1172
1:18:26,959 --> 1:18:30,75
your only hope is to tell me
the exact truth


1173
1:18:30,75 --> 1:18:37,167
of what happened that morning.


1174
1:18:37,167 --> 1:19:0,334
- God curse you
if you let me down now.


1175
1:19:0,334 --> 1:19:4,292
I did go in.


1176
1:19:4,292 --> 1:19:6,834
I went up the stairs and waited
above Morley's landing


1177
1:19:6,834 --> 1:19:10,417
till I could be sure
of getting him alone.


1178
1:19:10,417 --> 1:19:13,75
Then a bearded gent came out
and went down the stairs.


1179
1:19:13,75 --> 1:19:18,834
I was just making up my mind
to go


1180
1:19:18,834 --> 1:19:23,917
when another gent came out
and went down the stairs too.


1181
1:19:23,917 --> 1:19:27,0
I knew I had to be quick.


1182
1:19:27,0 --> 1:19:29,709
I went along and nicked
into his room without knocking.


1183
1:19:29,709 --> 1:19:32,459
I was all set
to have it out with him.


1184
1:19:32,459 --> 1:19:34,709
But he was lying there dead,


1185
1:19:34,709 --> 1:19:36,417
and I could see the bullet hole
in his head


1186
1:19:36,417 --> 1:19:45,667
where a black crust
of blood ran.


1187
1:19:45,667 --> 1:19:50,917
He was cold.


1188
1:19:50,917 --> 1:19:53,625
I knew I was in a jam then.


1189
1:19:53,625 --> 1:20:2,25
They were going to say
I'd done it.


1190
1:20:2,25 --> 1:20:3,417
I hadn't touched anything


1191
1:20:3,417 --> 1:20:6,125
except his hand
and the doorknob.


1192
1:20:6,125 --> 1:20:7,584
I wiped that
with my handkerchief,


1193
1:20:7,584 --> 1:20:10,209
both sides,
as I went out.


1194
1:20:10,209 --> 1:20:12,5
There was nobody in the hall,
and I let myself out


1195
1:20:12,5 --> 1:20:17,792
and licked it
as fast as I could.


1196
1:20:17,792 --> 1:20:19,75
That's the truth.
He was dead already.


1197
1:20:19,75 --> 1:20:28,875
You've got to believe me.


1198
1:20:28,875 --> 1:20:32,5
- By telling me the truth,


1199
1:20:32,5 --> 1:20:38,42
you have just saved yourself
from being hanged.


1200
1:20:38,42 --> 1:20:39,625
- I don't see it.


1201
1:20:39,625 --> 1:20:40,709
They're going to say--


1202
1:20:40,709 --> 1:20:42,42
- Monsieur Carter.


1203
1:20:42,42 --> 1:20:45,167
Your story has confirmed
what I knew to be the truth.


1204
1:20:45,167 --> 1:21:17,42
You can leave it now to me.


1205
1:21:17,42 --> 1:21:18,875
- Japp.


1206
1:21:18,875 --> 1:21:21,875
Ah, Poirot.


1207
1:21:21,875 --> 1:21:28,542
Yes?


1208
1:21:28,542 --> 1:21:31,42
What?


1209
1:21:31,42 --> 1:21:34,709
No, Poirot, I--


1210
1:21:34,709 --> 1:21:39,167
Well, I have to get clearance
on this, you know.


1211
1:21:39,167 --> 1:21:42,417
Go on.


1212
1:21:42,417 --> 1:21:45,167
Yeah.


1213
1:21:45,167 --> 1:21:47,84
All right,
I'll do what I can.


1214
1:21:47,84 --> 1:22:15,125
- Thank you, Chief Inspector.


1215
1:22:15,125 --> 1:22:18,375
- Mr. Hercule Poirot, sir.


1216
1:22:18,375 --> 1:22:20,25
- Thank you.


1217
1:22:20,25 --> 1:22:22,459
- This is about
Miss Sainsbury Seale, is it?


1218
1:22:22,459 --> 1:22:23,709
Have you found her?


1219
1:22:23,709 --> 1:22:25,709
- I hope you do not object,
Monsieur Blunt,


1220
1:22:25,709 --> 1:22:36,42
but I have invited a few
other people to join us.


1221
1:22:36,42 --> 1:22:39,25
- I'm not walking through
the streets in handcuffs.


1222
1:22:39,25 --> 1:22:41,292
- You'll walk
through the streets


1223
1:22:41,292 --> 1:22:48,5
in anything I tell you, my lad.


1224
1:22:48,5 --> 1:22:52,209
- I hope this is a matter
of importance, Alistair.


1225
1:22:52,209 --> 1:22:56,42
That Belgian detective sent
a most insolent message to us.


1226
1:22:56,42 --> 1:23:14,375
- Mother.


1227
1:23:14,375 --> 1:23:17,75
- Miss Neville to see you, sir.


1228
1:23:17,75 --> 1:23:19,959
- Mademoiselle Neville.


1229
1:23:19,959 --> 1:23:22,5
- Are there many more,
Monsieur Poirot?


1230
1:23:22,5 --> 1:23:25,917
If so, we may be more
comfortable in the boardroom.


1231
1:23:25,917 --> 1:23:28,417
Is the boardroom free,
Miss Montressor?


1232
1:23:28,417 --> 1:23:35,75
- Yes, Mr. Blunt.


1233
1:23:35,75 --> 1:23:41,84
- Frank!


1234
1:23:41,84 --> 1:23:42,625
- All right, all right.


1235
1:23:42,625 --> 1:23:44,667
You're still in His Majesty's
custody, you know.


1236
1:23:44,667 --> 1:23:50,75
Show a bit of respect.
Come on.


1237
1:23:50,75 --> 1:23:54,0
- Mesdames et messieurs,


1238
1:23:54,0 --> 1:23:56,709
good afternoon.


1239
1:23:56,709 --> 1:23:59,375
Since the beginning
of this case,


1240
1:23:59,375 --> 1:24:0,917
three people have died:


1241
1:24:0,917 --> 1:24:4,292
pauvre Monsieur Morley,
pauvre Monsieur Amberiotis,


1242
1:24:4,292 --> 1:24:7,75
and pauvre
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.


1243
1:24:7,75 --> 1:24:9,417
- I thought she was
still missing.


1244
1:24:9,417 --> 1:24:11,959
- No, no, no, no, mademoiselle.


1245
1:24:11,959 --> 1:24:14,625
In fact, Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale was dead


1246
1:24:14,625 --> 1:24:18,25
even before the investigations
of this case began.


1247
1:24:18,25 --> 1:24:23,25
The porter at Lichfield Court
told us


1248
1:24:23,25 --> 1:24:25,42
that Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale


1249
1:24:25,42 --> 1:24:28,0
had been to visit
Madame Chapman.


1250
1:24:28,0 --> 1:24:31,584
He saw her go to the apartment
and be let in.


1251
1:24:31,584 --> 1:24:34,625
She never came out again, no?


1252
1:24:34,625 --> 1:24:37,542
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
was never, ever seen again


1253
1:24:37,542 --> 1:24:40,417
until the police, they broke in
to the boxroom


1254
1:24:40,417 --> 1:24:41,834
of Madame Chapman.


1255
1:24:41,834 --> 1:24:44,42
- You mean it was
Mabelle Sainsbury Seale's body


1256
1:24:44,42 --> 1:24:45,709
in that flat after all?


1257
1:24:45,709 --> 1:24:48,584
- Indeed it was,
my dear Mademoiselle Neville.


1258
1:24:48,584 --> 1:24:52,667
You see, it was a very clever
double bluff.


1259
1:24:52,667 --> 1:24:55,334
The disfigured face was meant
to raise the question


1260
1:24:55,334 --> 1:24:58,584
of the identity of the woman.


1261
1:24:58,584 --> 1:25:5,875
But for me, the case,
it began with a shoe.


1262
1:25:5,875 --> 1:25:9,84
As I left the dentist's
after my séance,


1263
1:25:9,84 --> 1:25:12,875
a taxi stopped, a door opened,


1264
1:25:12,875 --> 1:25:16,0
and a foot of a woman
prepared to descend.


1265
1:25:16,0 --> 1:25:18,584
It was a foot
that was well shaped,


1266
1:25:18,584 --> 1:25:23,84
with a good ankle
and an expensive stocking.


1267
1:25:23,84 --> 1:25:26,209
The shoe was new, shining
patent leather


1268
1:25:26,209 --> 1:25:29,5
with a large, ornate buckle.


1269
1:25:29,5 --> 1:25:31,959
And when the rest of the lady
came into sight,


1270
1:25:31,959 --> 1:25:36,459
to be frank,
it was quite a disappointment.


1271
1:25:36,459 --> 1:25:40,334
As Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
descended from the taxi,


1272
1:25:40,334 --> 1:25:46,75
she caught her shoe buckle,
and it was wrenched off.


1273
1:25:46,75 --> 1:25:48,667
I picked it up
and returned it to her.


1274
1:25:48,667 --> 1:25:50,125
Not at all, madame.


1275
1:25:50,125 --> 1:25:53,0
- Ooh.
- Oh, dear.


1276
1:25:53,0 --> 1:25:54,542
You are welcome, madame.


1277
1:25:54,542 --> 1:25:58,959
- Thank you so much.


1278
1:25:58,959 --> 1:26:0,625
- That was all.


1279
1:26:0,625 --> 1:26:6,375
The incident, it was closed.


1280
1:26:6,375 --> 1:26:9,42
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Blunt,
to interrupt.


1281
1:26:9,42 --> 1:26:10,542
I've finished the post.


1282
1:26:10,542 --> 1:26:11,834
Is it all right if I leave now?


1283
1:26:11,834 --> 1:26:13,42
- Oh, no, no, no, no.


1284
1:26:13,42 --> 1:26:15,84
Please, Mademoiselle Montressor.


1285
1:26:15,84 --> 1:26:16,625
Please come and join the party.


1286
1:26:16,625 --> 1:26:18,459
- Monsieur Poirot is expounding


1287
1:26:18,459 --> 1:26:20,542
some extremely entertaining
theories.


1288
1:26:20,542 --> 1:26:36,84
- Please.


1289
1:26:36,84 --> 1:26:37,834
- Go on, Poirot.


1290
1:26:37,834 --> 1:26:40,0
- Thank you.


1291
1:26:40,0 --> 1:26:44,834
When Chief Inspector Japp
summoned me to Lichfield Court


1292
1:26:44,834 --> 1:26:47,625
because a body
had been discovered,


1293
1:26:47,625 --> 1:26:53,542
the first thing that I noticed
was a shabby buckled shoe.


1294
1:26:53,542 --> 1:26:55,709
- Well?


1295
1:26:55,709 --> 1:26:57,834
- Ah, you have failed
to appreciate the point,


1296
1:26:57,834 --> 1:26:59,709
Monsieur Blunt.


1297
1:26:59,709 --> 1:27:2,667
It was a shabby shoe.


1298
1:27:2,667 --> 1:27:5,375
It was a well-worn shoe.


1299
1:27:5,375 --> 1:27:8,542
But, you see,
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale


1300
1:27:8,542 --> 1:27:12,42
visited the apartment
on the evening of the same day


1301
1:27:12,42 --> 1:27:13,667
of the murder
of Monsieur Morley.


1302
1:27:13,667 --> 1:27:15,459
So in the morning,
they were the new shoes.


1303
1:27:15,459 --> 1:27:17,334
In the evening,
they were the old shoes?


1304
1:27:17,334 --> 1:27:20,167
- I can't see why
that's important.


1305
1:27:20,167 --> 1:27:22,42
- Eh bien, mademoiselle.


1306
1:27:22,42 --> 1:27:27,709
Poirot does not like things
he cannot explain.


1307
1:27:27,709 --> 1:27:32,625
Madame Chapman took a size five
in shoes.


1308
1:27:32,625 --> 1:27:34,959
I knew that
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale


1309
1:27:34,959 --> 1:27:36,375
wore a ten-inch stocking.


1310
1:27:36,375 --> 1:27:41,25
That is to say, she took
at least a size six in shoes.


1311
1:27:41,25 --> 1:27:45,125
So I went back
to reexamine the body.


1312
1:27:45,125 --> 1:27:48,834
My idea was that the face
had been disfigured


1313
1:27:48,834 --> 1:27:50,834
to hide the fact


1314
1:27:50,834 --> 1:27:53,209
that it really was the body
of Madame Chapman


1315
1:27:53,209 --> 1:27:56,375
dressed in the clothes of
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.


1316
1:27:56,375 --> 1:28:1,625
No, the shoe on the body
was size six,


1317
1:28:1,625 --> 1:28:3,5
so it looked as if it was
the body


1318
1:28:3,5 --> 1:28:6,75
of Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale after all.


1319
1:28:6,75 --> 1:28:11,125
But then why was the face
so disfigured?


1320
1:28:11,125 --> 1:28:14,75
By coincidence, the dentist
of Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale


1321
1:28:14,75 --> 1:28:17,292
was also the dentist
of Madame Chapman:


1322
1:28:17,292 --> 1:28:18,709
Monsieur Morley.


1323
1:28:18,709 --> 1:28:21,125
But he was dead.


1324
1:28:21,125 --> 1:28:24,792
However, the records, they
would have still existed, huh?


1325
1:28:24,792 --> 1:28:26,792
So the successor
to Monsieur Morley


1326
1:28:26,792 --> 1:28:28,959
would have been able
to positively identify the body


1327
1:28:28,959 --> 1:28:30,875
as that of
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.


1328
1:28:30,875 --> 1:28:34,625
- And could you identify
the body from these records?


1329
1:28:34,625 --> 1:28:35,917
- I could, sir.


1330
1:28:35,917 --> 1:28:37,875
It was not Miss Sainsbury Seale.


1331
1:28:37,875 --> 1:28:41,625
It was Mrs. Sylvia Chapman,
another patient of Mr. Morley's.


1332
1:28:41,625 --> 1:28:44,917
- But if it was the body
of Madame Chapman,


1333
1:28:44,917 --> 1:28:46,584
why was she dressed
in the clothes


1334
1:28:46,584 --> 1:28:50,917
of Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale?


1335
1:28:50,917 --> 1:28:54,167
An interesting problem,
n'est-ce pas?


1336
1:28:54,167 --> 1:28:57,0
So I cast my mind back


1337
1:28:57,0 --> 1:29:0,0
to the Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale whom I had met,


1338
1:29:0,0 --> 1:29:2,667
whom the Chief Inspector Japp
had met.


1339
1:29:2,667 --> 1:29:4,292
- I used to be an actress.


1340
1:29:4,292 --> 1:29:6,42
Just small parts, you know.


1341
1:29:6,42 --> 1:29:9,875
Then I went on a world tour,
and--


1342
1:29:9,875 --> 1:29:11,459
- And although everything
about her


1343
1:29:11,459 --> 1:29:12,792
and everything she said


1344
1:29:12,792 --> 1:29:14,917
was in perfect accord
with her given character,


1345
1:29:14,917 --> 1:29:18,584
I am now convinced that
the Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale


1346
1:29:18,584 --> 1:29:19,667
whom we have met


1347
1:29:19,667 --> 1:29:21,334
and the Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale


1348
1:29:21,334 --> 1:29:23,84
who accosted you,
Monsieur Blunt...


1349
1:29:23,84 --> 1:29:25,334
- You don't remember me.
Mabelle.


1350
1:29:25,334 --> 1:29:27,417
Gerda and I were on tour
together.


1351
1:29:27,417 --> 1:29:29,875
- They were not the same woman.


1352
1:29:29,875 --> 1:29:32,375
- You mean Miss Sainsbury Seale
was murdered


1353
1:29:32,375 --> 1:29:34,75
and someone else took over
her identity?


1354
1:29:34,75 --> 1:29:37,875
- Précisément.


1355
1:29:37,875 --> 1:29:42,917
Again, that is very dangerous,
n'est-ce pas?


1356
1:29:42,917 --> 1:29:47,667
But the rewards,
they were very high.


1357
1:29:47,667 --> 1:29:49,709
- Rewards?


1358
1:29:49,709 --> 1:29:51,209
What rewards?


1359
1:29:51,209 --> 1:29:55,25
- In just one moment,
if you please, Madame Olivera.


1360
1:29:55,25 --> 1:29:58,292
- Perhaps Mr. Morley
was murdered


1361
1:29:58,292 --> 1:30:0,42
because he would have been able
to identify


1362
1:30:0,42 --> 1:30:2,584
Miss Sainsbury Seale's body
by her teeth.


1363
1:30:2,584 --> 1:30:5,417
- Perhaps.


1364
1:30:5,417 --> 1:30:8,667
However...


1365
1:30:8,667 --> 1:30:15,584
Now we must face the facts.


1366
1:30:15,584 --> 1:30:19,334
In the beginning, we believed
that the body of Monsieur Morley


1367
1:30:19,334 --> 1:30:21,792
was first discovered
by the pageboy, Alfred,


1368
1:30:21,792 --> 1:30:24,209
at about 1:30.


1369
1:30:24,209 --> 1:30:30,0
But the fact is, I now know that
the body was first discovered


1370
1:30:30,0 --> 1:30:34,0
by Monsieur Frank Carter
about one hour earlier,


1371
1:30:34,0 --> 1:30:44,25
at about 12:30.


1372
1:30:44,25 --> 1:30:45,75
Two things occurred


1373
1:30:45,75 --> 1:30:48,417
between the death
of Monsieur Morley


1374
1:30:48,417 --> 1:30:51,959
and the discovery of his body
by Monsieur Carter.


1375
1:30:51,959 --> 1:30:54,875
The lady whose shoe buckle
I retrieved


1376
1:30:54,875 --> 1:31:5,834
was shown into the surgery
of Monsieur Morley.


1377
1:31:5,834 --> 1:31:8,25
While her accomplice
dragged the body


1378
1:31:8,25 --> 1:31:10,125
into the office
of the secretary,


1379
1:31:10,125 --> 1:31:13,125
the second
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale


1380
1:31:13,125 --> 1:31:16,959
changes the labels on the files
of Monsieur Morley


1381
1:31:16,959 --> 1:31:20,42
to ensure that the body
would be identified


1382
1:31:20,42 --> 1:31:24,834
as that of Madame Chapman.


1383
1:31:24,834 --> 1:31:28,5
She then leaves.


1384
1:31:28,5 --> 1:31:30,667
Alfred shows in the next patient


1385
1:31:30,667 --> 1:31:41,959
to the surgery
of Monsieur Morley.


1386
1:31:41,959 --> 1:31:44,792
Now, Monsieur Amberiotis had
never before met the dentist,


1387
1:31:44,792 --> 1:31:46,334
Monsieur Morley.


1388
1:31:46,334 --> 1:31:49,959
- It's been troubling me
since the journey from India.


1389
1:31:49,959 --> 1:31:58,125
- So our murderer, he was able
to assume his identity.


1390
1:31:58,125 --> 1:32:1,959
This dentist tells
to Monsieur Amberiotis


1391
1:32:1,959 --> 1:32:7,667
that it would be best
to freeze the gum.


1392
1:32:7,667 --> 1:32:9,792
He then administers an injection


1393
1:32:9,792 --> 1:32:13,959
which contains a dose
of novocaine and adrenaline


1394
1:32:13,959 --> 1:32:20,542
which is sufficient to kill him
six hours later.


1395
1:32:20,542 --> 1:32:22,5
- But why?


1396
1:32:22,5 --> 1:32:24,709
Why would anyone want
to kill this man?


1397
1:32:24,709 --> 1:32:27,84
- Because Monsieur Amberiotis
had learned something


1398
1:32:27,84 --> 1:32:29,709
from Mademoiselle
Sainsbury Seale.


1399
1:32:29,709 --> 1:32:32,542
He had learned a secret...


1400
1:32:32,542 --> 1:32:47,542
And a secret that could make him
a very rich man.


1401
1:32:47,542 --> 1:32:50,334
- I wish to speak
to Mr. Alistair Blunt.


1402
1:32:50,334 --> 1:32:57,25
- And Monsieur Amberiotis,
he was a blackmailer.


1403
1:32:57,25 --> 1:33:1,5
- Are you seriously suggesting
Amberiotis was blackmailing me?


1404
1:33:1,5 --> 1:33:4,167
- How could he blackmail
Alistair?


1405
1:33:4,167 --> 1:33:6,125
Alistair has no secrets.


1406
1:33:6,125 --> 1:33:9,459
- With the greatest respect,
Madame Olivera,


1407
1:33:9,459 --> 1:33:13,0
there I must disagree with you.


1408
1:33:13,0 --> 1:33:15,459
Monsieur Blunt has
a very big secret,


1409
1:33:15,459 --> 1:33:20,625
a secret that must be kept
at all costs.


1410
1:33:20,625 --> 1:33:23,167
And there is only one method
that is totally effective


1411
1:33:23,167 --> 1:33:28,375
in dealing with a blackmailer,
and that is to silence him...


1412
1:33:28,375 --> 1:33:30,959
Forever.


1413
1:33:30,959 --> 1:33:36,667
No, Monsieur Amberiotis,
he had to go.


1414
1:33:36,667 --> 1:33:39,334
And Monsieur Blunt had seen
the name of Monsieur Amberiotis


1415
1:33:39,334 --> 1:33:42,459
in the appointment book
belonging to Monsieur Morley.


1416
1:33:42,459 --> 1:33:45,875
His blackmailer used
the same dentist.


1417
1:33:45,875 --> 1:33:48,417
- That'll do for today, I think.


1418
1:33:48,417 --> 1:33:53,167
One more rinse, please.


1419
1:33:53,167 --> 1:33:56,667
- And so, Monsieur Blunt,
you devise a clever plan,


1420
1:33:56,667 --> 1:34:1,5
a very clever plan indeed.


1421
1:34:1,5 --> 1:34:4,334
You wait until your treatment
has been completed


1422
1:34:4,334 --> 1:34:17,417
by Monsieur Morley.


1423
1:34:17,417 --> 1:34:28,292
Then you shoot him.


1424
1:34:28,292 --> 1:34:31,542
While the dental records
are being falsified,


1425
1:34:31,542 --> 1:34:54,5
you drag the body into
the office of the secretary.


1426
1:34:54,5 --> 1:34:57,625
As I have said,
Monsieur Amberiotis


1427
1:34:57,625 --> 1:35:0,0
had never before met
Monsieur Morley,


1428
1:35:0,0 --> 1:35:9,25
so there was no reason
for him to suspect anything.


1429
1:35:9,25 --> 1:35:17,25
You administer to him
the fatal injection.


1430
1:35:17,25 --> 1:35:21,625
And when he has left, you drag
the body of Monsieur Morley


1431
1:35:21,625 --> 1:35:24,792
back into the surgery...


1432
1:35:24,792 --> 1:35:44,209
And arrange it
to look like suicide.


1433
1:35:44,209 --> 1:35:48,709
- I know, Monsieur Poirot,
you have a great reputation.


1434
1:35:48,709 --> 1:35:50,125
But I'm afraid in this case,


1435
1:35:50,125 --> 1:35:53,542
you are wrong
to a lunatic degree.


1436
1:35:53,542 --> 1:35:56,709
- Send him about his business,
Alistair.


1437
1:35:56,709 --> 1:36:1,209
Mr. Blunt's family stands
foursquare behind him.


1438
1:36:1,209 --> 1:36:5,584
- I am very pleased to hear it,
Madame Olivera.


1439
1:36:5,584 --> 1:36:7,667
But, you see,


1440
1:36:7,667 --> 1:36:10,834
when Monsieur Blunt
married your sister,


1441
1:36:10,834 --> 1:36:14,542
Mademoiselle Rebecca Arnholt,


1442
1:36:14,542 --> 1:36:16,625
he was not entirely honest
with her, no,


1443
1:36:16,625 --> 1:36:18,667
nor with her family,


1444
1:36:18,667 --> 1:36:21,75
because, as Monsieur Amberiotis
learned


1445
1:36:21,75 --> 1:36:24,917
from the real
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale,


1446
1:36:24,917 --> 1:36:29,834
Monsieur Blunt
was already married.


1447
1:36:29,834 --> 1:36:32,417
- Look, there's no need
for the rest of you


1448
1:36:32,417 --> 1:36:34,0
to listen to any more of this.


1449
1:36:34,0 --> 1:36:35,75
If you--
- No, no, no, Monsieur Blunt.


1450
1:36:35,75 --> 1:36:37,542
You were dazzled
by the Arnholt family,


1451
1:36:37,542 --> 1:36:40,875
by the vista not so much
of wealth but of power.


1452
1:36:40,875 --> 1:36:44,0
And so dazzled were you that you
deliberately committed a bigamy


1453
1:36:44,0 --> 1:36:46,625
and your real wife acquiesced
in the situation.


1454
1:36:46,625 --> 1:36:48,84
- Oh, what rot!


1455
1:36:48,84 --> 1:36:51,125
- What a fine portrait is this,
Monsieur Blunt!


1456
1:36:51,125 --> 1:36:54,167
Such a portrait would be
to any boardroom an ornament!


1457
1:36:54,167 --> 1:36:57,5
Monsieur Blunt standing beside
his beloved wife,


1458
1:36:57,5 --> 1:37:2,25
the former
Mademoiselle Rebecca Arnholt!


1459
1:37:2,25 --> 1:37:6,584
However, mesdames et messieurs,


1460
1:37:6,584 --> 1:37:12,292
I have here in my pocket


1461
1:37:12,292 --> 1:37:15,84
a certificate of marriage


1462
1:37:15,84 --> 1:37:18,459
between Martin Alistair Blunt


1463
1:37:18,459 --> 1:37:19,959
and an actress by the name of


1464
1:37:19,959 --> 1:37:23,292
Mademoiselle
Gerda Alexandra Grant


1465
1:37:23,292 --> 1:37:29,959
dated April the 25th, 1925.


1466
1:37:29,959 --> 1:37:35,459
And Mademoiselle Gerda Grant
is still very much alive.


1467
1:37:35,459 --> 1:37:38,417
Yes.


1468
1:37:38,417 --> 1:37:59,84
Indeed, she is
in this very room.


1469
1:37:59,84 --> 1:38:2,917
- And when I lived,
I was your other wife.


1470
1:38:2,917 --> 1:38:6,792
And when you loved,
you were my other husband.


1471
1:38:6,792 --> 1:38:8,125
Husband.


1472
1:38:8,125 --> 1:38:9,625
- Which is Beatrice?


1473
1:38:9,625 --> 1:38:12,75
- I answer to that name.


1474
1:38:12,75 --> 1:38:14,875
What is your will?


1475
1:38:14,875 --> 1:38:15,959
- Do not you love me?


1476
1:38:15,959 --> 1:38:19,375
- Why, no,
no more than reason.


1477
1:38:19,375 --> 1:38:21,875
Don't be so mamby-pamby,
Mabelle.


1478
1:38:21,875 --> 1:38:24,709
You think he's not good enough
for me.


1479
1:38:24,709 --> 1:38:27,584
Come on, Alistair.
I want to dance!


1480
1:38:27,584 --> 1:38:35,334
Dance, dance, dance.


1481
1:38:35,334 --> 1:38:37,667
- Gerda got such a kick
out of it all.


1482
1:38:37,667 --> 1:38:54,5
Didn't you, old girl?


1483
1:38:54,5 --> 1:38:56,959
- It was your skills
as an actress,


1484
1:38:56,959 --> 1:38:59,167
Mademoiselle Montressor,


1485
1:38:59,167 --> 1:39:2,209
that were the key
to the deception.


1486
1:39:2,209 --> 1:39:5,375
You connived at the bigamy
of your husband.


1487
1:39:5,375 --> 1:39:9,167
While he set about marrying
into the Arnholt family,


1488
1:39:9,167 --> 1:39:12,75
you assumed the identity
of Madame Sylvia Chapman.


1489
1:39:12,75 --> 1:39:15,792
- After all these years!


1490
1:39:15,792 --> 1:39:17,625
- Hello, Mabelle.


1491
1:39:17,625 --> 1:39:18,917
Come in.


1492
1:39:18,917 --> 1:39:21,84
- I've brought you some flowers.


1493
1:39:21,84 --> 1:39:22,959
- When the real
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale


1494
1:39:22,959 --> 1:39:24,334
met again your husband,


1495
1:39:24,334 --> 1:39:29,292
you murder your old friend
in cold blood.


1496
1:39:29,292 --> 1:39:35,209
- Go into the sitting room
straight through there.


1497
1:39:35,209 --> 1:39:38,334
- But your skills as an actress
are put to the test once again


1498
1:39:38,334 --> 1:39:41,709
as the second
Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.


1499
1:39:41,709 --> 1:39:46,75
- Ooh!


1500
1:39:46,75 --> 1:39:48,42
So kind.


1501
1:39:48,42 --> 1:39:50,125
- Not at all, madame.


1502
1:39:50,125 --> 1:39:51,334
- Ooh!


1503
1:39:51,334 --> 1:39:54,917
- Unfortunately for you,
it was Hercule Poirot


1504
1:39:54,917 --> 1:40:0,75
who retrieved your shoe buckle
that day.


1505
1:40:0,75 --> 1:40:2,375
But having safely deceived


1506
1:40:2,375 --> 1:40:4,334
the Chief Inspector Japp
and myself,


1507
1:40:4,334 --> 1:40:7,125
or so you thought,


1508
1:40:7,125 --> 1:40:9,584
you took the opportunity
to be as close as possible


1509
1:40:9,584 --> 1:40:10,834
to your husband.


1510
1:40:10,834 --> 1:40:15,125
You assumed the name
of Helen Montressor


1511
1:40:15,125 --> 1:40:21,459
and joined him as
his new, efficient secretary.


1512
1:40:21,459 --> 1:40:25,417
- We'll never make these people
understand, will we, my darling?


1513
1:40:25,417 --> 1:40:30,167
Such ordinary, unimaginative
people.


1514
1:40:30,167 --> 1:40:33,25
I wish I could make you
understand, Monsieur Poirot,


1515
1:40:33,25 --> 1:40:35,584
about my meeting with Rebecca
and my marriage.


1516
1:40:35,584 --> 1:40:39,125
Gerda understood,
didn't you, old girl?


1517
1:40:39,125 --> 1:40:41,209
We could have married again
after Rebecca's death,


1518
1:40:41,209 --> 1:40:46,792
but, do you know, we'd come
to rather enjoy all the secrecy.


1519
1:40:46,792 --> 1:40:48,625
She's an actress
through and through.


1520
1:40:48,625 --> 1:40:50,84
She would have found it
very dull


1521
1:40:50,84 --> 1:40:52,75
being just one character.


1522
1:40:52,75 --> 1:40:54,875
Well...


1523
1:40:54,875 --> 1:40:56,625
I've killed three people,


1524
1:40:56,625 --> 1:40:58,125
so presumably I ought to hang.


1525
1:40:58,125 --> 1:41:1,84
But haven't I done something
for England?


1526
1:41:1,84 --> 1:41:3,209
I have held it firm.


1527
1:41:3,209 --> 1:41:4,875
I have kept it solvent.


1528
1:41:4,875 --> 1:41:8,5
I have kept it free
from dictators.


1529
1:41:8,5 --> 1:41:10,417
I am necessary


1530
1:41:10,417 --> 1:41:13,334
to the continuing peace
and well-being of this nation.


1531
1:41:13,334 --> 1:41:15,459
- Is he saying
what I think he's saying?


1532
1:41:15,459 --> 1:41:17,209
- What about me?


1533
1:41:17,209 --> 1:41:19,125
He was gonna let me hang.


1534
1:41:19,125 --> 1:41:22,42
- Précisément.


1535
1:41:22,42 --> 1:41:26,42
Monsieur Blunt,
with his usual efficiency,


1536
1:41:26,42 --> 1:41:29,25
had provided for himself
a second line of defense.


1537
1:41:29,25 --> 1:41:32,209
If things went wrong,
you, Monsieur Carter,


1538
1:41:32,209 --> 1:41:37,375
you were to be
the scapegoat.


1539
1:41:37,375 --> 1:41:40,959
You see, by now,
Monsieur Blunt knows


1540
1:41:40,959 --> 1:41:43,625
of Monsieur Morley's opinion
regarding you,


1541
1:41:43,625 --> 1:41:46,209
and so he arranges
for you to be engaged


1542
1:41:46,209 --> 1:41:50,459
in a most mysterious fashion
as a gardener.


1543
1:41:50,459 --> 1:41:53,84
Ah, now, these flowers here,
they are beautiful.


1544
1:41:53,84 --> 1:41:55,84
And how easy
for Helen Montressor


1545
1:41:55,84 --> 1:41:58,667
to fire a shot
vaguely in your direction,


1546
1:41:58,667 --> 1:42:1,334
drop the pistol at your feet,


1547
1:42:1,334 --> 1:42:2,792
where you are bound
to pick it up?


1548
1:42:2,792 --> 1:42:5,542
- Drop that gun!
Help!


1549
1:42:5,542 --> 1:42:6,917
Oh, Mr. Blunt!


1550
1:42:6,917 --> 1:42:8,417
- You are caught red-handed,


1551
1:42:8,417 --> 1:42:11,84
and of course nobody is going
to believe your story,


1552
1:42:11,84 --> 1:42:13,0
your ridiculous story


1553
1:42:13,0 --> 1:42:16,125
about being employed
by the secret service.


1554
1:42:16,125 --> 1:42:18,84
No.


1555
1:42:18,84 --> 1:42:21,375
As far as Monsieur Blunt
is concerned,


1556
1:42:21,375 --> 1:42:24,625
you can end your short life
on the gallows.


1557
1:42:24,625 --> 1:42:29,459
- I don't waste pity
on people like him.


1558
1:42:29,459 --> 1:42:31,84
- Eh bien, Monsieur Blunt.


1559
1:42:31,84 --> 1:42:33,709
That is where you and I,
we do not see alike,


1560
1:42:33,709 --> 1:42:37,5
for to me, the lives
of those three people


1561
1:42:37,5 --> 1:42:46,459
are just as important
as your own life.


1562
1:42:46,459 --> 1:42:47,792
Monsieur Blunt,


1563
1:42:47,792 --> 1:42:51,542
you talk of the continued peace
of this nation, huh?


1564
1:42:51,542 --> 1:42:54,0
Oh, yes, that is very good.


1565
1:42:54,0 --> 1:42:57,917
But Poirot is not concerned
with nations.


1566
1:42:57,917 --> 1:43:2,125
Poirot is concerned
with private individuals,


1567
1:43:2,125 --> 1:43:9,667
who have the right not to have
taken from them their lives.


1568
1:43:9,667 --> 1:43:14,625
- Martin Alistair Blunt
and Gerda Alexandra Blunt,


1569
1:43:14,625 --> 1:43:23,209
I arrest you
on charges of murder.


1570
1:43:23,209 --> 1:43:41,959
- Please.


1571
1:43:41,959 --> 1:43:50,834
Oh, my--my poor dear sister.


1572
1:43:50,834 --> 1:43:54,0
I don't know why I'm crying.


1573
1:43:54,0 --> 1:43:56,25
- Come on, Mother.


1574
1:43:56,25 --> 1:44:0,42
- I never liked him anyway.


1575
1:44:0,42 --> 1:44:3,167
- Why don't we go back home?


1576
1:44:3,167 --> 1:44:14,584
To New York.


1577
1:44:14,584 --> 1:44:17,75
- That could have been me,
you know.


1578
1:44:17,75 --> 1:44:20,167
- I think I'm going to keep
a close eye on you in future,


1579
1:44:20,167 --> 1:44:21,75
Frank Carter.


1580
1:44:21,75 --> 1:44:24,417
You're not safe out on your own.


1581
1:44:24,417 --> 1:44:37,959
Secret service.


1582
1:44:37,959 --> 1:44:39,667
- Look at it, Poirot,


1583
1:44:39,667 --> 1:44:42,417
the trappings
of wealth and power.


1584
1:44:42,417 --> 1:44:44,0
And yet underneath it all...


1585
1:44:44,0 --> 1:44:45,417
- Yes, Chief Inspector?


1586
1:44:45,417 --> 1:44:47,292
- Well, I mean,
it just shows you, doesn't it?


1587
1:44:47,292 --> 1:44:50,125
They're no better than we are
when it comes down to it.


1588
1:44:50,125 --> 1:44:51,459
It's the little chaps


1589
1:44:51,459 --> 1:44:53,875
that keep things
on an even keel,


1590
1:44:53,875 --> 1:44:55,292
chaps like you and me.


1591
1:44:55,292 --> 1:44:56,709
- Ah.


1592
1:44:56,709 --> 1:45:0,959
But there are no little chaps,
Chief Inspector,


1593
1:45:0,959 --> 1:47:0,959
particularly not Poirot.
