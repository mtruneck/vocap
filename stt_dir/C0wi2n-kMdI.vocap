###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: What`s that time of year to crown homecoming kings and we have
###4 one from Florida. You are not going to want to miss. It`s coming up in just a few minutes,
###8 right here on CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###16 The first thing we are talking about today is the civil war in Syria. Now, there are
###26 some signs that the conflict might be changing a bit. The fighting in the Middle Eastern
###31 nation has been going on for 20 months now. It started because some Syrians wanted changes
###36 to their government. Like for their president to step down. Different rebel groups have
###41 been fighting against the government. This weekend, they officially formed a single coalition,
###46 and some analysts think that a unified opposition can have a better chance for victory. It`s
###50 been estimated that more than 35,000 people have been killed since the Civil War started,
###55 more than 400,000 have left their homes because of the fighting. And that includes two brothers
###60 that Arwa Damon met for her next report. Teachers, this is a personal account about the war.
###65 We suggest that you preview it. The younger brother who is 11 years old, was wounded in
###70 Iraq at attack. He lost one of his legs, that`s when his older brother, who is 21, made a
###76 promise that led them out of their home country. Here is their story.
###79 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###80 ARWA DAMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Like many other boys his age, 11-year old Abdurrahman (ph)
###85 wanted to be a professional soccer player when he grow up. But like so many others in
###91 his homeland of Syria, the violence shattered his dream.
###95 OMAR, BROTHER: After he woke up as just, we were just saying, I was crying. I cannot (ph)
###102 control myself. He said please don`t cry. If you love me, don`t cry.
###105 DAMON: And that is when Omar made Abdurrahman a promise, that he would walk again.
###111 OMAR: He started to hang onto that idea. So I`m going out, and he kept saying to me, when
###120 are we - when are we leaving? Yeah, because once - every time they are fighting, jets
###125 come, he says, when are we leaving? We should leave.
###128 DAMON: Omar is now an expert at changing his brother`s bandages. He started to save money
###134 for a prosthetic, but realized that it was going to take too much time. He began asking
###140 around, and a group of visiting Egyptian doctors told him about the Global Medical Relief Fund,
###146 a small U.S. NGO, dedicated to helping children badly injured in disaster and war zones.
###154 Its founder Alyssa Montante (ph) was quick to respond. But first, the brothers had to
###160 get to Turkey. A car drove them as close to the border as it could, the driver`s last
###167 words "You are on your own now." Omar`s arms were aching as he carried his brother and
###173 their three bags across the muddy field. The brothers eventually made their way to Ankara
###179 in Turkey. But the boys don`t have passports. Their visas to the U.S. were denied, and now
###186 they are waiting to see if the State Department will grant them humanitarian parole.
###191 OMAR: The most important thing that he is learning at this time, I think, it`s to be
###197 aware of everything, I mean to grow up his mind, I mean. He`s not a child anymore.
###203 DAMON: Arwa Damon, CNN, Ankara.
###204 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###205 AZUZ: Next up, a natural disaster in Venice, Italy. Severe flooding has led to the deaths
###210 of several people there, 200 Italians have reportedly been forced out of their homes.
###215 Venice is in Northern Italy, it`s a major seaport and a popular tourist destination.
###219 It`s famous for its canals. So you might usually think of people riding down the street it
###224 boats, but this is anything but usual. Two big weather systems combined together and
###230 drenched the city. Earlier this week, 70 percent of Venice was under water. It was the city`s
###236 sixth highest water level in 140 years.

###240 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s first "Shoutout" goes out to Mr. Toijala`s social studies classes
###246 at Lakeland Union High School in Minocqua, Wisconsin.
###251 Which should be this part of the executive branch of the U.S. government? You know what
###255 to do, is it the Library of Congress, U.S. Copyright Office, Cabinet or U.S. Supreme
###261 Court? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###267 The executive branch includes the cabinet, advisors to the president. That`s your answer
###276 and that`s your "Shoutout."
###278 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###279 AZUZ: But you are going to expect to see some changes in President Obama`s cabinet in the
###286 days ahead. When a president is reelected. Some of the advisors from the first term stay
###290 on, others don`t. It`s up to the president to decide who stays and who goes. Now, the
###295 vice president is considered part of the cabinet, but the other members are not elected. They
###301 are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, including the vice president,
###305 there are 16 members of the cabinet, you see eight of those positions here, and here are
###310 the remaining eight positions. One interesting thing about the cabinet: the word "cabinet"
###314 doesn`t actually appear in the U.S. Constitution. But the concept does. Article II, Section
###320 2 says "[the president] may require the opinion in writing, of the principal Officer in each
###325 of the executive departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective
###330 Offices ..." It doesn`t say what departments or how many of them there should be. The first
###335 U.S. president had four cabinet members, more were added over the years.
###339 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###341 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Time for a "Shoutout Extra Credit." Ohms, amperes, coulombs are
###347 associated with what? You know what to do? Is it sound, electricity, pressure or temperature?
###354 Put another three seconds on the clock and go.
###357 You might get a charge from knowing that these options are all associated with electricity.
###366 That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout Extra Credit."
###371 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###373 AZUZ: "Motor Trends" magazine names a car of the year. And this year, for the first
###377 time, the winner is all electric. It`s the Tesla model S, and according to representatives
###382 from the magazine, the voting wasn`t close. The luxury car didn`t win just because it`s
###388 electric. "Motor Trends" said it won in part because of its performance. Zero to 60 in
###392 four seconds, and because it`s one of the most efficient cars ever tested, averaging
###396 nearly 75 miles per gallon or the electric equivalent of that. Only a couple of hundred
###402 have been sold, they ain`t cheap, the Tesla averages between $50,000 and $100,000.
###409 Our next story today comes from Port St. Lucy, Florida. High school student there has cerebral
###413 palsy. It`s a medical disorder that effects movement, posture or muscle tone. His fellow
###418 students nominated him to the homecoming court. But if you are worried we just spoiled the
###423 ending of that story, no, we`ll let WPBF`s Randy Gillenhal (ph) take it from here.
###429 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###429 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s homecoming football at Centennial High School. And watching from
###434 the stands, sits senior Hakam Daley in his wheelchair. Hakam has cerebral palsy. His

###445 book bag at school.
###446 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Going through a crowded hallway can be tough.
###448 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Live hasn`t always been easy for Hakam. Put up for adoption, he`s
###452 been in and out of foster homes for most of his life, but one thing he does have, is a
###457 big smile and lots of friends who nominated him to be homecoming king.
###461 HAKAM DALEY, HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR: When I heard the message, my -- I -- I had no words to
###468 describe. I was so happy.

###472 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kayla Donohue was the cheerleader, and one of Hakam`s good friends. She secretly
###477 rallied up the senior class and got them to put his name on the homecoming court.
###481 KAYLA DONOHUE, STUDENT: It just showed how well as the group we can come together and
###484 make such a special person have such a special experience that he is going to remember for
###490 the rest of his life.
###491 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hakam lines up with the other nominees: football stars and popular
###494 kids. He`ll have to roll his wheelchair out onto the field.
###497 DALEY: I feel nervous, very nervous, it`s going to be exciting. I know that God is with
###506 me.
###506 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But as they call his name, he`s got a surprise for everybody in the crowd.

###545 AZUZ: What a story! Today`s before we go, segment is explosive. Now, like a lot of you
###550 , I like a good firework show. The government of Kuwait really likes a good firework show.
###555 Hopefully, the country`s people do too, this one went on for a while. 77,282 individual
###562 fireworks. Yes, that is a new record and one that cost $15 million to set. The country
###569 was celebrating the 50th anniversary of its constitution, obviously, that`s an event they
###573 don`t take lightly, that extinguishes all the time we have for today. We will be back
###577 with more illuminating stories tomorrow. So I hope to see you all then. Bye now.
