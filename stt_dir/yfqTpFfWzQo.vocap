###1 THANK YOU. WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE WE GOING
###5 TO HAVE TIME FOR?
###6 OKAY. WELL, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE MATERIAL I'M PRESENTING
###19 TODAY. FRANKLY, DOESN'T NEED TO COME ACROSS IN THE ECOLOGY
###25 SECTION BECAUSE A BIG PART OF WHAT I'M PRESENTING TODAY
###31 IS ETHOLOGY. THE SCIENCE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOR. I'M PRESENTING
###37 IT HERE IN ECOLOGY BECAUSE I DO THINK IT FITS. AND I THINK THE
###43 LINK BETWEEN ETHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY CAN BE MADE STRONGER AND
###49 WILL BE MADE STRONGER IN COMING YEARS. BUT ALSO, YOU DON'T GET
###54 ETHOLOGY IN ANY OTHER PLACE IN THIS COURSE OR REALLY IT'S HARD TO
###60 GET IN AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE IN THE DEPARTMENT. WE'VE GOOD
###63 ADVANCED COURSES IN IT. SO I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO BRING IN.
###67 BUT I CANNOT CUT BACK ON IT AND THAT IS SOME OF WHAT GOES TODAY.
###77 I'M GOING TO START BY LOOKING AT THE LEVELS OF ORGANIZATION
###80 CONCEPT. IT'S THIS ORIENTING GENERALIZATION THAT'S USED IN
###84 BIOLOGY FOR DEMARCATING THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN FIELDS OR
###89 DEMARCATING BOUNDARIES BETWEEN NATURAL PHENOMENON OF THINGS WE
###92 STUDY. WE'LL GO OVER THAT FIRST. AND THEN LOOK AT THE FIELD OF
###99 ETHOLOGY. I TEND TO STUDY ANIMALS MORE THAN I STUDY PLANTS SO
###106 YOU GET A BIAS FROM ME TOWARD ANIMALS. BIO 1B HAS BEEN BIASED TOWARD PLANTS AND
###112 I'LL TRY NOT TO MAKE NOT TO MAKE
###114 APOLOGIES FOR MY OWN BIAS TOWARD ANIMAL. A LOT OF EXAMPLES YOU'LL GET ARE
###119 FROM ANIMALS. ETHOLOGY THE SCIENCE OF INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR, OR
###126 THE SCIENCE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOR IS REALLY FOCUSED ON ANIMALS
###130 BECAUSE BEHAVIOR REALLY, ANIMALS ARE OUTWARDLY MUCH MORE
###134 COMPLEX THAN PLANTS ARE. YOU CAN SPEAK OF PLANT BEHAVIOR OF THE
###139 EXTERNAL ACTIVITY OF A PLANT. THAT'S IT'S BEHAVIOR IF YOU
###143 
###143 DEFINE BEHAVIOR IN THAT WAY. BUT REALLY ETHOLOGY IS THE FIELD
###147 OF STUDY OF ANIMALS. WE'LL LOOK AT EXAMPLES, TIME PERMITTING, OF LEARNING
###153 PROBLEM SOLVING COGNITION AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO ECOLOGY. HOPEFULLY
###159 GETTING INTO SOME BEHAVIOR ECOLOGY AND OPTIMAL ORIGIN, IDEAS AND
###166 FINISHING WITH THE ECOLOGY OF SOCIAL GROUPS. I WILL MOVE BRISKLY TO TRY TO GET THROUGH
###170 THIS MATERIAL.
###171 A LOT OF IT IS JUST FUN, STICKING WITH THE THEME OF TRYING NOT TO GO TOO FAST IN TERMS
###177 OF INFORMATION COVERED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS COURSE. SO LET'S
###181 JUST HAVE FUN AND LOOK AT PICTURES AND THINK ABOUT THESE
###185 IDEAS.
###187 WHAT I REALLY HOPE IS YOU'LL THINK ABOUT IT AFTER CLASS AND
###190 DISCUSS IT IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND LABS, SOME OF THESE IDEAS.
###195 THE LEVELS OF ORGANIZATION CONCEPT. YOU GO TO ALMOST ANY BIOLOGY
###199 TEXTBOOK AND YOU'LL SEE SOMETHING ABOUT THE BIOLOGICAL HIERARCHY
###205 OR CONCEPT OF LEVELS OF ORGANIZATION. IT'S THE WAY WE ORIENT
###210 OURSELVES IN SCIENCE OFTEN. OUR DEPARTMENTS ARE DIVIDED ON THE
###216 BASIS OF THE STUDY OF THESE DIFFERENT LEVELS. JOURNALS ARE
###220 DEDICATED TO THE STUDY OF THE PHENOMENON AT VARIOUS LEVELS HERE. AND IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL
###227 SENSE
###228 THIS SCHEME, THIS HIERARCHY IS THOUGHT TO REPRESENT THE ONTOLOGY
###233 OF NATURE, THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE OF EMPIRICAL NATURE. SO WE LOOK
###240 AT IT HERE TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHERE WE'RE WORKING. AND WHAT
###243 ECOLOGISTS STUDY IN THIS HIERARCHY. YOU HAVE AT THE ONE EXTREME
###249 ATOMS, THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF MOLECULES WHICH THEMSELVES GO INTO
###254 THE COMPOSITION AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE ORGANELLES, THAT BUILD
###259 THE CELLS, THAT ARE THE FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCKS OF ORGANISMAL
###264 STRUCTURE. VARIOUS CELL TYPES CONSTRUCTED INTO TISSUES AND THE
###270 
###270 TISSUES THEMSELVES ASSEMBLED INTO ORGAN SYSTEMS THAT MAKE UP AN
###276 ORGANISM. SO ONCE WE GET TO THIS HALF OF THE HIERARCHY, WITH
###284 THE ORGANISM AS A SORT OF A PIVOT BETWEEN THESE LOWER LEVELS, THESE LOWER
###288 AND SMALLER AND INCLUDED LEVELS WITHIN THE ORGANISM, WE EXTEND IT ABOVE THE ORGANISM
###295 TO ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS
###297 TO GROUPS OF ORGANISMS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTS.
###310 THAT IS A TREE. IT'S HERE. IT'S MAYBE A MAPLE TREE, SOME
###317 KIND OF MAPLE. IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL ORGANISM. THAT IS ONE
###323 INDIVIDUAL. IT'S A PLANT, IT'S A TREE, IT'S A MAPLE TREE. IN
###328 OUR HIERARCHY, THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN ORGANISM, RIGHT?
###335 HAVE A BUNCH OF THEM TOGETHER IN A SMALL FOREST, YOU HAVE A
###342 POPULATION. IF WE'RE SPEAKING OF THE SAME SPECIES OF MAPLE, THIS
###349 IS A POPULATION OF ORGANISMS. WE TEND TO USE THAT TERM ONLY
###353 WITH REFERENCE TO MEMBERS OF SAME SPECIES. BUT POPULATIONS DO
###358 NOT EXIST IN ISOLATION. THEY EXIST AS COMMUNITIES OF ORGANISMS,
###363 OF MULTIPLE POPULATIONS. NOT ONLY ARE THERE THE MAPLES BUT THERE
###369 ARE THE OTHER SPECIES OF TREE, THERE ARE MICE AND DEER IN THE
###375 SYSTEM. BIRDS OVERHEAD. MICROBES IN THE SOIL, EARTHWORMS,
###380 THIS IS A COMMUNITY OF MANY POPULATIONS, MANY SPECIES COEXISTING
###385 IN A SINGLE LOCAL. YOUR EMPHASIS MIGHT BE NOT JUST THE
###393 BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITY OF THAT SYSTEM BUT THE INTERACTING
###397 BIOLOGICAL AND ABIOTIC SYSTEM. I'LL JUST HAVE TO AVOID WRITING
###404 ON THE BOARD TODAY.
###408 THIS INTERACTING COMMUNITY OF ABIOTIC SYSTEM IS WHAT PEOPLE
###412 CALL AN ECOSYSTEM. OR A LANDSCAPE OR A SEASCAPE. THIS
###418 INTERACTING, BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL SYSTEM OFTEN TAKEN AT THIS
###424 
###424 SCALE, A LARGE-SCALE.
###428 AND SCALE IT UP FURTHER AND YOU HAVE THE WHOLE EARTH, YOU
###431 HAVE THE BIOSPHERE OR ECOSPHERE, ALL THE WORLD'S ECOSYSTEMS AND
###437 LANDSCAPES PUT TOGETHER.
###443 THAT'S ALL FINE. I ONLY HAVE ONE DIFFICULTY WITH THIS
###449 FORMAT REALLY. AND IT'S A PARTLY A RESULT OF THE EVOLUTION OF
###453 OUR LANGUAGE AND OUR TERMS. BECAUSE PEOPLE USE THE WORD
###456 ECOSYSTEM QUITE A LOT THESE DAYS TO REFER TO ANY OF THESE LEVELS. YOU
###463 WILL HEAR SOMETIMES ABOUT THE CELLULAR ECOSYSTEM OR YOUR OWN
###469 PERSONAL ECOSYSTEM. YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL. OR WE CAN SPEAK OF
###475 ECOSYSTEM OF THIS CLASSROOM. RIGHT? BECAUSE ALL OF THESE
###481 BIOLOGICAL LEVELS EXIST IN A PHYSICAL CONTEXT. YOU CAN'T
###485 SEPARATE A BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON FROM ITS ABIOTIC CONDITIONS AND
###490 ITS ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. THEY'RE INSEPERABLE. IN THAT SENSE
###494 EVERYBODY BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON IS ALSO A ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM OR
###500 FOR SHORT, AN ECOSYSTEM. JUST RECOGNIZE THAT THEY'RE REALLY TWO
###505 USES OF THAT WORD THAT ARE EVOLVING. ONE, A DESCRIPTION OF THAT PARTICULAR LEVEL ALWAYS
###511 BETTER BELOW A LANDSCAPE *SYNONAMOUS WITH A LANDSCAPE AND BELOW THE BIOSPHERE. ANOTHER
###518 MORE BROAD DEFINITION OF ECO
###520 SYSTEM, AS A SHORTHAND FOR ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM. WHEN WE USE IT
###525 THAT WAY IN THAT BROAD SENSE WE'RE PERFECTLY JUSTIFIED IN
###527 REFERRING TO A SAY CELLULAR ECOSYSTEM.
###531 I WON'T FOCUS ON THESE. THESE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF TEXTBOOK EXAMPLES OF HOW THE
###539 HIERARCHY MIGHT BE PRESENTED. SHORT ON TIME. I'LL JUST
###542 DELIVER THOSE TO YOU ON YOUR SLIDES. LOOKING AT THIS ONE, WE
###548 CAN PLAY A LITTLE GAME. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE CAN SEE MY LASER
###551 
###551 POINTER IN THE ADJOINING ROOMS. WHAT WOULD THIS BE AN EXAMPLE
###557 OF? IT'S NOT A GREAT PICTURE EXAMPLE, I WOULDN'T THINK. BUT OF OUR LEVELS,
###562 GIVEN WHAT ELSE YOU SEE HERE, CONTEXT. WHAT WOULD THIS BE? A POPULATION.
###566 IT'S A FAMILY. PROBABLY. IT'S A MOTHER AND OFFSPRING BUT,
###572 YEAH, IT'S A POPULATION. IF YOU CAN FOCUS ON A POPULATION AT
###577 ANY SCALE REALLY. WHETHER IT'S JUST FOUR OR FIVE INDIVIDUALS,
###581 PARENT AND OFFSPRING OR ALL THE SPECIES OF FIELD MOUSE IN THAT AREA,
###587 THAT WOULD BE THE POPULATION. THAT WOULD MAKE THIS SUGGEST THAT
###591 THIS IS THE COMMUNITY, RIGHT. MANY SPECIES OF ORGANISM, *FAMILIADS
###595 IN THE RAINFOREST WITH THEIR TREES AND FROGS THAT ARE LIVING INSIDE THEM AND THE INSECTS
###599 THAT ARE FLITTING ABOUT AND SO FORTH. THIS WOULD BE AN ECOSYSTEM BECAUSE YOU HAVE
###604 WATER THERE, I GUESS, AND SKY ABOVE REPRESENTING THE ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. AND
###609 THE INTERACTION OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY OF THE ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. THIS REPRESENTING
###614 A
###614 LANDSCAPE IN THIS CONTEXT. A LANDSCAPE, SOMETIMES A TERM USED TO REFER TO MULTIPLE
###620 ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR INTERACTION. SO BE FLEXIBLE. THAT'S ACTUALLY A HARD
###625 LESSON TO LEARN COMING INTO BIOLOGY, IS THE DEFINITIONS IN
###630 BIOLOGY AND BOUNDARIES ARE OFTEN MUCH MORE FUZZY THAN IN PHYSICS
###633 OR CHEMISTRY. THAT'S THE REALITY OF BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON.
###639 THEY EXIST VERY OFTEN WITH FUZZY BOUNDARIES SO YOU NEED TO BE
###642 FLEXIBLE WITH YOUR DEFINITIONS. WE CAN'T FORGET THE WHOLE EARTH AND ITS ROLE, RIGHT.
###652 GETTING INTO ETHOLOGY ABRUPTLY. THE SCIENCE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOR. IT
###657 REALLY CAME TO FORM WITH THE WORK OF THESE THREE INDIVIDUALS.
###664 VON FRISH, LORENZ AND TINBERGEN, THREE EUROPEANS WORKING VARIOUSLY IN THE EARLY AND MID AND
###673 LATE 1900S. WHO WERE RECOGNIZED IN THE '70S FOR THE
###679 CONTRIBUTION THAT THEY'VE MADE. NOT RECOGNIZED SO MUCH DURING
###682 
###682 THEIR MOST ACTIVE PERIODS OF WORK BUT MUCH LATER WITH NOBEL PRIZE FOR
###686 THEIR WORK IN ANIMAL BEHAVIOR. THEY WERE CREDITED WITH HAVING ADVANCED
###691 THE STUDY OF ORGANISMAL BEHAVIOR BEYOND AN OLDER AND STUBBORN DICHOTOMY BETWEEN VITALISTS
###699 AND
###699 MECHANISTS WHO REALLY WERE AT LOGGERHEADS AND STRUGGLING TO MAKE
###707 STRONG INROADS IN TERMS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL AND FIELD STUDY OF ANIMAL
###712 BEHAVIOR. ONE OF THE MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE GUYS WAS TO COUCH
###717 THE STUDY OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOR IN AN EVOLUTIONARY CONTEXT. TO ASK
###724 QUESTIONS ABOUT BEHAVIOR IN THE CONTEXT OF EVOLUTION AND ECOLOGY.
###730 SO A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF THEIR WORK. STARTING WITH VON
###733 FRISH AND HIS STUDY OF HONEY BEES AND THEIR COMMUNICATION.
###740 THESE SLIDES ARE NOT, THESE TOPICS ARE NOT PART OF YOUR
###743 READING. THEY'RE IN YOUR BOOK SO YOU'RE WELCOME TO REFER TO
###746 YOUR PARTS OF YOUR BOOK THAT COVER THEM. BUT THEY ARE NOT PART OF YOUR ASSIGNED READING.
###752 THIS IS ALL TOO INTERESTING
###753 JUST TO SKIP. I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S MORE AMAZING? THAT BEES
###759 ACTUALLY DO THIS OR THAT THIS GUY DISCOVERED THIS. REALLY
###763 FANTASTIC THE WAY HONEYBEES COMMUNICATE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR
###766 ENVIRONMENTS. AND SPECIFICALLY THEIR FOOD RESOURCES WHEN THEY
###770 GET BACK TO THE HIVE. A BEE COMES BACK TO THE HIVE AND IT'S A
###773 BIG BUZZ OF ACTIVITY AND EVERYONE IS HUDDLING AROUND WATCHING THE
###778 BEE DANCE. IF IT'S SORT OF A ROUND DANCE LIKE THIS, IT INDICATES THAT FOOD IS VERY CLOSE
###785 BY AND GO SEE THIS FOOD..
###788 WITHOUT MUCH ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION. BUT IF THE BEE PERFORMS A
###793 A DANCE MORE STRUCTURED WITH THESE SEMI-CIRCLES OF MOVEMENT, AND THEN THIS
###799 LONG LINE WHERE IT WAGGLES, IT'S GIVING SPECIFIC
###804 INFORMATION TO THE VIEWER ABOUT WHERE THE FOOD SOURCE IS IN
###808 RELATION TO THE SUN, IN RELATION TO THE POSITION OF THE HIVE
###812 ITSELF. SOMETHING ABOUT ITS DISTANCE GIVEN THE DURATION OF THAT
###816 
###817 LINEAR WAGGLE DANCE. IT COMMUNICATE THAT'S TO THE OTHER BEES
###821 AND OFF THEY GO. IF IT WAGGLES LONG, ALONG THAT LINEAR
###826 STRETCH THE NEXT BEE KNOWS TO FLY QUITE FAR AND OFF IT GOES. JUST
###831 INCREDIBLE.
###834 HARD WON INFORMATION FROM VERY PATIENT OBSERVATION UNDER A
###838 HOT SUN, GETTING STUNG IN THE FIELD. THIS IS WHAT THE SENSE
###843 IN WHICH THIS IS ALL GROUNDED IN BASIC NATURAL HISTORY. NIKO
###847 TINBRGEN'S RESEARCH, WASPS, FOLLOWING WASPS BACK TO THEIR NEST, NOTING THAT THEY SEEM
###855 TO FIND THE HOLE THAT IS THEIR NEST.
###857 BASED ON A LANDMARK SYSTEM AND SOME SORT OF SPATIAL LEARNING PROCESS. SO HE SET UP A SERIES
###864 OF LANDMARKS AROUND
###865 PINECONES TO TEST THIS IDEA. ALLOWED THE WASPS TO ORIENT WITH THOSE PINECONES TO COME BACK
###870 TO THE NEST.
###872 BUT SWITCHED IT UP ON THE POOR LITTLE WASP AND MOVED THE PINECONES AWAY FROM THE NEST
###877 SUCH THAT WHEN THEY CAME BACK NEXT TIME, SURE, IT WENT TO ITS LANDMARKS
###881 AND USED THOSE AND SOUGHT THE NEST INSIDE THE RING OF PINECONES AND WOULD DO SO INDEFINITELY
###887 UNTIL IT STUMBLED ON THE EXISTING NEST. AN INSIGHT INTO HOW THEY'RE USING
###894 SPATIAL MAPS TO FIND RESOURCES OR IN THIS CASE THEIR SHELTER.
###903 CONRAD LORENZ IS A BELOVED FIGURE IN BIOLOGY IN MANY WAYS IN
###907 PART BECAUSE OF ENDEARING PICTURES LIKE THIS FROM HIS HOME WHERE HE REALLY HAD
###913 GREAT INSIGHTS INTO ANIMAL BEHAVIOR AND EVEN HUMAN BEHAVIOR. HE WAS A POPULARIZER
###918 AND VERY WELL KNOWN. BUT THESE PICTURES OF VARIOUS WATER FOWL
###923 FOLLOWING HIM AROUND HIS PROPERTY ARE REALLY KNOWN. THIS IS THE
###928 PHENOMENON OF INPRINTING WHERE AN ORGANISM GOES THROUGH SENSITIVE
###931 DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD EARLY IN ITS LIFE. WHERE IT'S EXPOSED TO A
###936 CERTAIN BEHAVIOR OF ANOTHER ORGANISM OR OBJECT. USUALLY THE
###941 PARENT OR SOME MEMBER OF SAME SPECIES, THAT IT TAKES ON AS A
###946 FIXED PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR ITSELF. SO IT'S A MECHANISM DURING
###951 
###951 THIS SENSITIVE OR CRITICAL PERIOD IN DEVELOPMENT TO ADOPT BEHAVIORS
###956 FROM OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SAME SPECIES. IN THIS CASE IT'S JUST FOLLOWING AROUND
###961 WHAT ITS JUDGED TO BE THE PARENT WHEN EXPOSED TO AN OBJECT THAT'S
###967 PARENTAL ENOUGH DURING THIS PERIOD. THERE IS AN EXAMPLE IN YOUR BOOK HOW THIS PHENOMENON
###976 OF IMPRINTING IS USED TO ASSIST
###977 MIGRATION IN ENDANGERED SPECIES OF BIRDS TODAY.
###981 I'M GOING TO SKIP THIS EXAMPLE ENTIRELY. ITS A REALLY GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW OF THE GENETIC
###989 BASIS OF
###989 BEHAVIOR. SO THE INNATE ASPECTS OF BEHAVIOR. I'LL FOCUS INSTEAD ON THE INNATE ASPECTS ON
###998 THE
###998 LEARNED COMPONENTS.
###1002 SO WE'VE JUST LOOKED AT IMPRINTING AND SPATIAL LEARNING AT THE TOP AND
###1005 MOVING CLOCKWISE, WE CAN SEE, DISCUSS SOCIAL LEARNING AND ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING AND
###1011 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR, BEHAVIOR IN COGNITIVE LEARNING. LET'S LOOK
###1014 AT EXAMPLE OF SOCIAL LEARNING FROM THE PRIMATES. SOMETHING WE, OF COURSE,
###1018 EXCEL AT SOCIAL LEARNING. WE'RE DOING IT HERE. BY PRIMATES ARE ALSO EXCEL AT
###1025 THIS TYPE OF LEARNING. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET A VIDEO TO
###1029 WORK. JUST AN AMAZING VIDEO OF THIS MOTHER CHIMPANZEE IN THE
###1035 CENTRAL AFRICAN RAINFOREST. THERE'S A CAMERA SET UP AND IT'S NEVER BEEN SET UP BEFORE.
###1043 YOU'LL SEE HER JUMP BECAUSE IT CLICKS.
###1047 THERE. SHE'S NOT -- SHE KNOWS SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS
###1050 TERRITORY WHERE SHE'S BEEN FORAGING IN PREVIOUS DAYS. SOMEONE SET UP A LITTLE BLIND WITH A
###1055 CAMERA. BUT SHE FEELS COMFORTABLE
###1058 ENOUGH THAT SHE CAN GO ABOUT HER BUSINESS. SHE BRINGS A LONG HEAVY STICK TO
###1063 PUUNCTURE THE SIDE TO CREATE ACCESS AND TO INCITE THE WORKERS INSIDE
###1069 THE NEST TO COME OUT. AND THEN A FINER STICK THAT SHE'S BROUGHT IN HER MOUTH TO
###1074 PROBE THAT LARGER HOLE TO GET THE WORKERS AND THE TERMITES
###1079 TO ATTACK IT AND GRAB ON SO SHE CAN EXTRACT THOSE TERMITES
###1085 TO EAT THEM. HER INFANT IS HANGING AROUND. AND OFTEN IN THESE
###1092 CASES WHETHER CRACKING NUTS OR FISHING FOR TERMITES LIKE THIS, THE INFANT IS OFTEN RIGHT
###1097 ON HER
###1099 HIPS WATCHING VERY CLOSELY WHAT SHE'S DOING. THEY'RE OBSERVING THE
###1103 PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR AND LEARNING FROM WHAT SHE'S DOING. THE
###1107 OBJECTS SHE SELECTS TO PERFORM THE TASK, THE MANNER IN WHICH
###1111 SHE GO ABOUT THE TASK. THIS IS A TYPE OF SOCIAL LEARNING
###1115 THAT'S PARTICULAR IMPORTANT IN MAMMALS AND PRIMATES AND HUMANS.
###1121 BUT YOU SEE IT SURPRISINGLY IN MANY ORGANISMS. I DON'T KNOW OF
###1130 ANY PLANT EXAMPLES.
###1133 A MORE SIMPLE TYPE OF LEARNING PERHAPS, ASSOCIATIVE
###1137 LEARNING. YOU DO SOMETHING THAT ENDS UP BEING UNCOMFORTABLE OR A RAT
###1143 EATING BAIT LACED WITH POISON THAT DOESN'T KILL IT BUT MAKES IT SICK, WILL
###1147 BE INCLINED TO AVOID THAT ODOR THAT TYPE OF BAIT THE NEXT TIME. ASSOCIATES THE EXPERIENCE
###1153 WITH SOMETHING
###1153 UNPLEASANT AND LEARNS FROM IT. BUT WHAT ABOUT JUST BEING
###1158 CLEVER? HERE'S A CROW WITH A STRAIGHT WIRE. THE WIRE IS
###1164 STRAITS SO IT CAN HARDLY PICK THE OBJECT UP. SO FIGURE IT OUT.
###1172 SOME ORGANISMS CAN. AND CROWS AND RAVENS, IT'S BENDING THE WIRE
###1178 NOW INTO A HOOK THAT IT CAN USE TO LIFT THE OBJECT OUT. QUITE
###1187 WELL DONE. BECAUSE, IT'S SMART, RIGHT? I DON'T HAVE ANY
###1192 PROBLEM CALLING THAT ANIMAL CLEVER. IT HAS ITS OWN COGNITION
###1197 THAT'S, FLEXIBLE WITH DEGREES OF FREEDOM SUCH THAT IT CAN PERFORM THESE KINDS OF REMARKABLE
###1203 TASK. IN SAYING THAT WE'RE REALLY NOT SAYING ANY PHYSIOLOGICALLY
###1209 ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR OR MIND AND
###1214 BODY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. YOU CAN STUDY THIS EXTERNALLY WHILE
###1221 BLACK BOXING THE COGNITION LARGELY.
###1227 THIS WHOLE FIELD OF BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY IS WHAT WOULD LINK THE FIELDS OF
###1230 ETHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY. WE CAN DO MORE. AND HOPEFULLY SOME OF
###1235 
###1235 YOU WILL DO MORE AND MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO FORMING THAT BRIDGE BETWEEN ECOLOGY AND ETHOLOGY.
###1241 IT'S REALLY RIPE FOR DEVELOPMENT. I'LL JUST
###1246 HINT HERE AT THE EVOLUTION OF THESE BEHAVIORS. BUT THIS WILL
###1257 MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE TO YOU AFTER YOU HAVE STUDIED EVOLUTION
###1259 ITSELF IN THE SECOND MODULE. SO CARRY THAT SLIDE ACROSS THE
###1264 SEMESTER. WE'LL GET BACK TO IT.
###1268 IN THIS EVOLUTIONARY CONTEXT, EVOLUTION BY NATURAL SELECTION
###1274 IS THOUGHT TO HAVE MADE EFFICIENT MANY THESE BEHAVIORS.
###1281 SOME SPEAK OF OPTIMIZING THESE BEHAVIORS FOR ACTIVITIES.
###1286 REDUCING THE COSTS AND MAXIMUMING THE BENEFITS. YOU WILL SEE
###1292 SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN ONE OF YOUR LABS IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
###1296 YOU'LL SEE A BIT OF THIS IN ACTION. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF AN
###1300 OPTIMAL FORAGING, STUDY IN OPTIMAL FORAGING, WITH CROWS AND A TYPE
###1309 OF SEA SNAIL, A WHELK. AN EXAMPLE IN YOUR BOOK AND, LET ME JUST
###1319 BRIEFLY REVIEW HERE. YOU CAN LOOK IN THE BOOK FOR DETAILS.
###1322 BASICALLY THE CROWS CARRY A HARD SHELLED SNAIL AND DROP IT ON HARD
###1328 SURFACE TO CRACK IT. THEY PICK MUSCLES UP AND DROP IT ON THE
###1338 PAVEMENT. CROWS DO IT. AND THE INVESTIGATORS WERE INTERESTED
###1344 IN WHETHER THEY HAVE A PARTICULAR HEIGHT THEY PREFER TO DROP THEM
###1349 FROM. AS YOU IMAGE, IT'S TRADEOFF BETWEEN HOW HIGH YOU WANT
###1353 TO FLY AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT FLIGHT. IF YOU CARRY
###1361 ONE OF THESE SNAILS UP A METER AND DROP IT, IT'S NOT GOING TO
###1363 BREAK. IT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY TO FLY 30 METERS. BUT IT
###1372 MIGHT BE WORTH IT IF YOUR SNAIL IS SO NUTRITIOUS. THERE ARE
###1376 TRADEOFFS IN THIS PROCESS. I'LL LET YOU REVIEW THE SLIDE.
###1384 INVESTIGATORS FOUND THE MOST EFFICIENT HEIGHT BASED ON THEIR
###1389 
###1389 EXPERIMENTS, THE MOST EFFICIENT HEIGHT TO DROP THEM FROM WHERE
###1394 YOU REDUCE THE ENERGY EXPENDED IN LIKELIHOOD OF BREAKAGE AND MAXIMIZE THE
###1398 LIKELIHOOD OF BREAKAGE AROUND FIVE METERS. AND MEASURED IN THE FIELD THE CROWS THEN AVERAGE
###1403 SOMETHING
###1404 SIMILAR IN THE HEIGHT IN WHICH THEY DROP THE SNAIL. SUPPORTING A NOTION OF THEIR BEHAVIOR
###1412 HAVING BEEN, QUOTE UNQUOTE, OPTIMIZED IN SOME SENSE. I'LL LET YOU THINK ABOUT
###1416 WHETHER EVOLUTION HAS DONE THAT. IS THAT VIA EVOLUTION BY
###1420 NATURAL SELECTION THAT THAT BEHAVIOR HAS OPTIMIZED OR IS THIS THE
###1424 CROW COGNITIVELY REALIZING THAT BETTER HEIGHTS TO DROP THINGS FROM
###1431 DURING ITS OWN LIFETIME. OPEN QUESTIONS.
###1436 HAVING GLAZED THROUGH THESE, I REALLY ONLY HAVE ONE MORE
###1442 SECTION TO COVER. AND HOPEFULLY WE KNOW THE PROBLEM NOW IN THE
###1448 TECHNOLOGY ISSUE HERE SO IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
###1454 ORGANISMS ARE MEMBERS OF POPULATIONS. YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE
###1461 AN ISOLATED ORGANISM OUTSIDE OF ITS POPULATION CONTEXT BECAUSE THEY
###1469 NEED TO REPRODUCE WITH OTHER ORGANISMS. AND SOME ORGANISMS NOT
###1477 ONLY EXIST IN POPULATIONS BUT LIVE CLOSELY WITH ONE ANOTHER IN
###1482 HIGHLY INTERACTIVE SOCIETIES, SOCIAL GROUPS. SO LET'S THINK A
###1489 LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY, ABOUT THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF SOCIAL
###1495 LIVING, OF GROUP LIVING. WE EXCEL AT THIS IN OUR CITIES AND
###1502 CLASSROOMS. WE DO PRETTY WELL AS A BUNCH OF LITTLE PRAIRIE DOGS
###1507 GETTING ALONG WELL ENOUGH TOGETHER IN TIGHT GROUPS LIKE THIS. PIGEONS,
###1512 GO OUT TO TOWN AND YOU'LL SEE THIS. WHY ARE PIGEONS DOING THIS? GIVE ME
###1519 A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY YOU MIGHT SEE A SCENE LIKE THIS.
###1522 WE'RE ALL IN HERE TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU GUYS NEED CREDITS AND YOU NEED TO GRADUATE AND
###1525 WE ALL NEED TO BE IN THE SAME PLACE. WHY
###1527 ARE PIGEONS DOING THIS? SAFETY. YEAH. MAYBE THERE'S SAFETY
###1534 IN BEING PART OF A BIG GROUP. IF IT WAS JUST ONE PIDGEON OUT BY
###1537 ITSELF IT COULD GET HARASSED TO THE POINT OF DYING BY A HAWK OR
###1544 
###1544 SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHEREAS IF IT'S PART OF A BIG GROUP, MAYBE
###1547 INDIVIDUALLY, EACH IS LESS VULNERABLE. POSSIBLY. WHAT ELSE? WHY MIGHT THEY BE
###1553 TOGETHER HERE? CHANCE OF FINDING A MATE. YEAH. IF YOU'RE A
###1560 BUNCH OF ORANGUTANS SPREAD ABOUT THE FOREST, LIVING SOLITARILY
###1568 YOU MIGHT HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING A MATE UNLESS YOU CONGEAL INTO
###1572 A MORE LOCALIZED REGION. SAME WITH BIRDS AND OTHER ORGANISMS.
###1576 IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO FIND A MATE WHEN REPRODUCTIVE SEASON COMES
###1580 AROUND. WHAT ELSE? YEAH? MOST LIKELY FIND FOOD. OR MAYBE THERE'S A GREAT PATCH
###1590 OF FOOD. PERHAPS ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES HAVE LEAD THIS GROUP
###1596 TO EXIST HERE. SO NOT ANY REAL SOCIAL DYNAMIC ITSELF. BUT THE
###1602 EXISTENCE OF THIS RESOURCE. THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE OF IT THAT
###1605 I'LL HIGHLIGHT IN A MINUTE BUT MAYBE MORE OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
###1608 IN TERMS OF FINDING FOOD. ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD CONSIDER AS A REASON
###1613 WHY THESE GUYS MIGHT BE TOGETHER?
###1619 ONE THING, ON THE RIGHT ARE
###1621 SCHOOLING FISH. AND SHARKS MOVING THROUGH THESE SCHOOLS OF FISH.
###1625 THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THAT SAFETY-IN-NUMBERS IDEA, PROBABLY
###1630 RIGHT? IF YOU'RE A SCHOOL OF FISH AND YOU'RE A LITTLE FISHY OUT BY YOURSELF,
###1634 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SURVIVE THE ATTACK OF A BIG SHARK. BUT IF YOU'RE IN THIS MASSIVE
###1638 SCHOOL, THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING NAILED IS LESS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MANY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS
###1642 AROUND YOU.
###1646 THE OLD SAYING ABOUT
###1647 WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER A GRIZZLY BEAR WITH YOUR FRIEND IN THE FOREST, WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?
###1652 RUN
###1652 FASTER THAN YOUR FRIEND.
###1656 SO THE IMAGE ON THE LEFT IS, SHOWS SOME DATA ABOUT FLOCKING
###1664 PIGEONS. AND THE DISTANCE WITH WHICH THEY PERCEIVE A PREDATOR
###1670 IN RELATION TO THE SIZE OF THE FLOCK. THAT'S SOMETHING CALLED THE MANY EYES
###1676 HYPOTHESIS FOR FLOCKING. BY BEING IN A BIG GROUP YOU HAVE MORE
###1680 
###1680 EYES, MORE PERCEPTUAL, A GREATER PERCEPTUAL RANGE FOR PERCEIVING
###1686 THREATS AS YOU MULTIPLY YOUR SENSORY DEVICES. PENGUINS HAVE
###1693 BECOME VERY POPULAR IN RECENT YEARS BASED ON A COUPLE BIG FILMS. WHY ARE THEY HANGING
###1702 OUT
###1702 TOGETHER? THE REPRODUCTIVE ASPECT. BUT WHAT ELSE? WARMTH.
###1709 THERMO REGULATION. BASIC PHYSIOLOGICAL BENEFIT OF HUDDLING IN
###1714 SUCH A BITTERLY COLD ENVIRONMENT. BY MAINTAINING CLOSE CONTACT,
###1720 KEEP THEIR TEMPERATURES UP.
###1728 LET'S THINK OF AT LEAST ONE NEGATIVE EXAMPLE OF, I'VE DROPPED THE
###1733 NEGATIVE AMONG THE POSITIVE. AN EXAMPLE HERE IN A MOMENT. DISEASE, AND SPREAD OF
###1740 PATHOGENS. THERE'S A MAJOR COROLLARY OF GROUP LIVING FOR MANY
###1746 ORGANISMS. THE GREATER THE DENSITIES, THE MORE RAPID AND LIKELY
###1751 THE SPREAD OF PATHOGENS AND DISEASE. TRUE IN HUMAN SOCIETIES IN
###1756 MANY CASES TOO, RIGHT? BIRDS, FEATHER MITES ARE A BIG PROBLEM FOR
###1762 BIRDS. MITES THAT NIBBLE AND EAT THE FEATHERS. AND BIRDS THAT
###1769 LIVE IN LARGER COLONIES MAY EXPERIENCE INFESTATION OF SUCH MITES BY
###1776 CLOSE GROUP LIVING. THESE YOU CAN SEE MORE AND MORE AROUND
###1781 CALIFORNIA. IT'S THE LARGEST BIRD IN CALIFORNIA EXCEPT MAYBE
###1785 THE CONDOR. I SAW A FLOCK OVER BERKELEY OF WHITE PELICANS. WHEN YOU SEE THEM
###1792 IN BERKELEY THEY'RE GOING TO BE WAY OVERHEAD AND FLYING FROM
###1796 POINT REYES. YOU SEE THEM MORE AND MORE. THEY'RE FABULOUS
###1801 WHEN YOU SEE THEM IN THEIR OWN ECOSYSTEMS. BECAUSE THEY'LL GROUP FORAGE. THEY'LL FORM
###1806 A
###1806 PHALANX LIKE THIS ONE ON THE BOTTOM. AND HERD FISH INTO THE
###1810 SHALLOWS WHERE THEY CAN SCOOP THEM UP MORE EASILY. BECAUSE
###1814 THEY'RE DIPPPING THEIR BIG BILLS AND HEADS UNDER THE WATER TO
###1819 SCOOP THE FISH. THEY NEED TO HERD THEM TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE. AND
###1824 
###1824 ANOTHER EXAMPLE AND A GOOD ONE TO LEAVE YOU WITH. GROUP FORAGING THAT ENABLES RELATIVELY
###1833 SMALL
###1833 ORGANISMS TO CAPTURE NUTRITIOUS LOADS OF FOOD WHEN WORKING
###1839 TOGETHER. SORRY FOR THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. SEE YOU
###1843 WEDNESDAY. MY OFFICE HOURS ARE EVERYDAY AFTER LECTURE.
###1850
