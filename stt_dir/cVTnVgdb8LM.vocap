###2 I'm going to take us back to World War II, where they
###5 had bombers crewed by a whole group of men here.
###9 And of course these men weren't all pilots--a lot
###12 of these men were gunners on the airplane.
###14 And their job was to sit behind these guns
###17 and protect the aircraft.
###20 They sat in these Plexiglas turrets, and these turrets
###25 were scattered through the airplane;
###27 you can see them on the front here,
###29 and on the top, and the back, and the side
###32 and down the bottom, depending on the aircraft.
###34 And their job was to protect the bomber from
###38 fighter aircraft attacking it.
###40 That's what they did.
###43 And so these guns were strategically placed on the
###45 airplane as a protection for that aircraft.
###49 But it wasn't just for that aircraft alone.
###51 What they would do was that they would fly in formation.
###54 And one airplane's gunners could also protect the other
###58 aircraft that was flying along next to them.
###61 And so they would have these very complex formations
###64 that they would fly in-- all to protect each other.
###66 And as they flew in formation, they had strength;
###70 you could say there was strength in their numbers.
###72 But there was also strength in the way that they were
###74 fitted together in formation.
###77 Now, anyone flying alone was a sitting duck.
###82 It was just like--well, you're out there. Sorry.
###86 And sometimes when we try to establish--
###90 you run into somebody and you're trying to witness
###92 --they say, "Where do you get this information?"
###94 "Well,from the Bible." "How can I know the Bible is true?"
###97 Oh, we quickly grab this Scripture 2 Timothy 3:16
###100 and we say, "All Scripture is inspired by God."
###104 And we throw this little piece of information out there;
###107 and it's like--bing! Battle's won. Uh-uh.
###111 The guy comes back and says, "Oh, Scripture? So, all
###116 "Scripture is inspired by God. Well, I agree with
###118 "that--yeah. The Hindu Gita, it's inspired by God too;
###126 "let me see, the Quran, it's Scripture;
###129 "it's inspired by God. Listen, while we're at it,
###132 "we might as well throw the Book of Mormon and a few
###133 "other books that we know about into that.
###135 "All these Scriptures that different people hold sacred,
###137 "they're inspired by God, too.
###138 It says 'all Scripture,' doesn't it?"
###141 And your sitting there and thinking--whew!
###143 How did we get here?
###145 And then you try to nail the word,
###147 "Well, no, no, no, no. It means inspired."
###149 "Oh, yeah, I wrote a poem the other day, and I just,
###153 "oh, I just felt so inspired; it just flowed; it just came.
###158 That must be Scripture, too."
###161 And you think, oh, how'd that happen?
###163 We're off on some sort of rabbit trail.
###165 And then, oh, my! You get to the word 'God'--
###168 and now who knows where you are going to end up?
###171 And there in just one little short sentence,
###174 not a whole verse, you just feel like you
###176 kinda ran up against a wall.
###177 You know what you have?
###179 You have one little piece of truth--
###181 flying by itself unprotected.
###184 It's true, it's powerful.
###186 It, indeed, even that little bit alone, is very potent.
###190 But, the enemy comes in there and envelopes it
###194 with its ameba there and wraps itself around
###196 and shoots it down, and when you are left; you think--
###199 "Oh, where am I supposed to-- where should I begin?"
###202 Well, we want to talk a little bit about that.
###205 We want to talk about flying truth in formation.
###207 And I just want to start out by saying,
###210 that what I want to present here is not
###212 because I'm sort of scholar and I sat down
###216 with a long face and I looked at the Scriptures for a
###218 while and studied it--all of a sudden, "Oh, I see that!"
###221 The way I began to see this was, as I was
###223 teaching individuals, all of a sudden, I would
###225 see something come in there and grab them.
###228 And I--wow, that's powerful!
###231 Oh, now I see why that's in the Scripture that way!
###237 It would really have quite an effect on them.
###242 Now, what I want to show you here is actually a framework
###245 that is stuck together in the Scriptures.
###249 And when we fly this together, it's extremely potent.
###255 When we teach the way that we're talking about,
###258 you're actually doing this.
###259 Now, when we teach, in a sense, what we do, is we take
###264 a person--the individual that is coming to us,
###266 the unbeliever--we take their framework, and
###269 we have some little tricks of the trade that we've learned.
###271 We take their framework and we hang it up and we say,
###275 "We'll just let it sit over there."
###276 And we teach them this whole new framework.
###279 Now, there's ways that we do that. For example,
###281 I was teaching a fellow; he was a very sharp man.
###285 And as we were going through the story, beginning
###287 with Creation and working our way through the Fall
###289 of mankind, and then eventually, we got to the story
###292 of Noah; and we're developing it out a little bit--
###294 we just touch on these stories.
###296 He looks at me and says,
###298 "John, you don't believe this, do you?"
###302 And this is the way I answered it.
###304 I said, "Well...what I believe is up to me,
###309 "and what you believe is entirely up to you.
###311 "We're finding out what the Bible says about itself.
###315 "And I guess my job is try to present it as clearly as I can,
###319 "and your job as a student is to say,
###321 "'I understand it' or 'I don't.'" I said,
###322 "The question here is not whether I believe it or not,
###325 but the question is, 'Do you understand it.'"
###328 He said, "Oh, yeah, I understand it."
###330 I said, "Well, then lets go on."
###332 And what I did there was I took his framework and I
###334 kinda hung it up and I said, "Let's just
###336 leave that there for a while."
###339 Later on, he said,
###340 "John, do you remember that time where I kinda mocked
###342 you a little bit for the story of Noah and that stuff?"
###345 I said, "Yeah, I remember that."
###347 And he said, "You know, I wasn't believing any of it
###350 "up to that point. To me, it was just a bunch of myths
###352 and stories. I wasn't believing any of it."
###356 But he said, "What happened… as I went on, through the
###360 "story, I began to say, 'You know what?
###363 "'This just couldn't happen.
###365 This had to be planned from the bottom up.'"
###368 And he said, "I went back and believed
###370 all of this here that I had rejected."
###373 Now what we're going to do is, we're going to take a look
###375 at the different aspects in God's Word that God has
###379 built right in there to the architecture of His Word,
###381 that causes a person to come to a point in saying,
###384 "This just couldn't happen. This just couldn't happen."
###388 And where the veracity--the truthfulness of God's Word--
###391 just comes through like an extremely powerful hammer.
###394 And either a person out of emotion has to just
###398 reject the Word of God, or because he's a thinking
###402 person, he says, "You know, it's gotta be true."
###406 But there's no such thing as a thinking person
###408 looking at it and saying intellectually,
###410 "This can't happen."
###412 No, he's got to do it as an emotional response
###414 to the truth; it's so powerful.
###416 Let's take a look at it. First of all,
###418 the prophetic events in the Scriptures verify the message.
###421 Now how does this work?
###423 I want to just take a look at the books of Moses.
###425 If you were to take a look at the lifespan of Moses here,
###428 Moses wrote what we might want to call some
###431 'must-know' information.
###434 He wrote about the origin of the universe
###436 --this is critical stuff.
###438 He wrote about the origin of mankind, about the origin
###441 of evil and sin, origin of death,
###445 how to escape sorrow, the source of joy.
###448 He wrote about eternal life.
###450 And this is all critical information that Moses
###453 either touched on or developed out quite a bit--
###456 that is either what you might want to call
###458 'must-know' information.
###461 And he recorded this in the last third of his lifespan.
###465 And you find this information in the books Genesis,
###469 Exodus--on through to Deuteronomy.
###471 And as we look at this information here,
###474 we can ask ourselves,
###475 "How do we know that what Moses wrote was right?"
###478 I mean, back in those days there, the people that lived
###481 in that 40 years of Moses lifespan, that knew him--
###484 as they were seeing this material written, they say,
###487 "Well, how do we know this is right?
###489 "What is, what sort of reality do we have here
###494 that can verify this information?"
###497 Well, Moses not only wrote 'must-know' information,
###499 he also wrote Prophetic information.
###502 And this has some really severe consequences.
###506 Now listen to this--tell you a little story here.
###510 I first used this in India here a couple years ago.
###512 I said, What would happen if somebody was to
###517 call a press conference?
###519 Now nobody knows this guy, but he calls this press
###521 conference, and he says, "Listen, I have some very
###524 "important information I have to pass on.
###526 "What's going to happen (now this is Friday)
###529 "what's going to happen is, on Monday, the Ganges River
###534 is going to turn to blood."
###536 And you can see a little handful of scattering, smattering
###539 of reporters sitting out there, and they're write--
###541 "What? Say that again?"
###544 "The Ganges River is going to turn to blood."
###547 "To blood?" "Yes, that's what I said.…
###551 That's what you need to write down."
###554 Well, if it even hit the newspapers at all,
###556 you know the Saturday edition--if it even got there
###558 at all--it probably got to page forty, little column in the
###561 bottom, and it would say, "Crazy man,"
###563 or "Kook says, 'Ganges river is going to turn to blood.'"
###566 Well, what if on Monday, the river actually did
###569 turn to blood? Whoa!
###572 Monday's afternoon edition --bang--big letters:
###575 "Ganges turned to blood, forecast by--"
###578 "What was that guy's name? I didn't even get it down."
###581 It's crazy. But it would be up there.
###585 And there'd be reprints of that tiny little column--
###588 "Yep, we did actually say that this man said that."
###590 Everybody would be talking about it.
###591 You'd have scientists down there sampling it, seeing if
###594 it's some sort of reversal of the red tide.
###596 And political pundits would be talking about this--looking wise.
###600 And everybody would be talking about this.
###602 And there would probably be a lot of people saying,
###604 "That guy hit it lucky; it's just some sort of weird
###605 phenomena that he was going to come up with."
###608 Might be some guy trying to sell it on Ebay, who knows?
###612 But, what if he called a second press conference?
###617 That room would be crowded, wouldn't it?
###619 It would, wouldn't it? There'd be cameras running.
###621 There's CNN. Everybody would be there.
###623 They'd all be wanting to arrange to get him
###626 on their talk show and discuss this. And let's say, he said,
###628 "Well, on Thursday this country is going to be
###632 overrun with frogs-- overrun with frogs."
###637 Well, you could imagine the next day, they'd be saying--
###640 scientists would be saying-- "Frogs don't breed this time
###644 "of year, and they don't normally have--
###646 that's just ridiculous!"
###648 There would be all sorts of pundits giving comments
###651 on this, but I can tell you what-- on Wednesday night, about
###656 11:35, everyone would be sitting there very, very quiet.
###660 The windows open, listenting.
###663 11:50. 11:55. Midnight.
###669 Ribbit, ribbit.
###673 Whoa!
###674 And just this noise just permeates the land as they
###678 all being to sing and croak. Whoa, I mean, you can
###682 imagine the next morning-- this guy is being hauled in.
###685 The prime minister of the country wanting to meet with
###689 him and discuss this. And it would be big, big news.
###693 And if this guy then said, "Well, listen,
###695 "just wanted you to get the point here:
###698 "that there's a message that a particular God
###702 "wants to pass on to the world.
###704 "And he wants you to know it's important--he has some
###708 "'must-know' information that you need to know and
###711 "I've been kinda appointed his messenger.
###714 And, oh, by the way, next Friday--lice."
###720 You know what?
###723 Everybody would be listening very carefully.
###726 And everybody would be hanging on
###728 not only for the fact that he's saying next Thursday's lice,
###732 but they would also want to know this 'must-know' information.
###735 You know why? Because all of a sudden,
###737 he has incredible credibility in their eyes.
###740 And the Bible tells us this happened, didn't it,
###744 to a man named Moses?
###746 And it says that God exalted him in the eyes
###749 of the people; he was like a god to Pharaoh.
###751 I mean, it's like, what Moses said, the people
###755 just breathed it in like pure oxygen.
###757 It had to be.
###758 And the way the Scripture's design… it was
###761 this prophetic information was linked together with the
###764 'must-know' information, and it's inserted in such a way
###767 that you can't divide it.
###770 And Moses, all the way through the last 40 years of his life,
###773 we see him saying, "God says this is going to happen."
###776 And guess what? It happened.
###777 There was 100% accurate fulfillment of those things
###781 that he said was going to happen.
###783 It just went down that way.
###785 And so, the people during Moses' lifespan, if they wanted
###788 to know how this 'must-know' information was true,
###791 all they had to think is, "Well, Moses said this
###794 other stuff was going to happen and it happened
###795 just the way it is; well, it's gotta be true."
###800 Now, that works for people in Moses' lifespan,
###803 but what about now?
###805 Well, Moses didn't just give prophecies during his life span.
###808 He also said things that were going to happen after he died.
###813 And if we were to take his lifespan and shrink it down--
###815 like this, into a box--and stick it right at the end of our
###818 timeline there, and extend our timeline down
###820 to 2006 AD, and look at this, we'd see that, yes,
###825 Moses gave prophecies in that last 40 years of his life;
###828 but he also talked about issues and events
###832 that would happen right down to this present day.
###835 And after Moses died, for those people that were
###839 asking that question--"How do we know that this is right?"--
###844 they would be able to just look around and say,
###846 "Well, is it happening the way that
###848 Moses said it would happen?"
###850 Now Moses said that after he died,
###852 the people would be disobedient, remember that?
###854 And he said, "You're stiff necked;
###857 you're going to become disobedient."
###859 And people after would be able to look around and say,
###862 "Have we done that?"
###864 We can read in the book of Daniel.
###867 Look what Daniel said:
###886 Daniel was very conscious that they had rebelled
###890 against the Lord. He labeled it for what it was.
###894 Daniel was very conscious of judgment
###898 being played out on his life.
###900 And so as people of Daniel's day looked around and said,
###903 "How do we know that this information is right?
###905 'Well, we are doing exactly what Moses said we
###908 "would do, we've become disobedient;
###910 we've rebelled against the Lord."
###912 Not only that, Moses had said that because of that,
###914 they would suffer curses.
###916 Remember that? He wrote that--Deuteronomy.
###921 And so the people would be able to look around, and
###924 they would see that--"You know what? Boy, just as
###927 Moses wrote, we're suffering curses."
###928 Look what Daniel continued on in his prayer and said:
###931 (This is a continuation of what we just read.)
###957 The linkage was very clear in their mind between what
###961 Moses had written and what they were experiencing in their life.
###965 And so, when they asked those questions:
###968 "How do we know this is right?" Well, they could
###970 just look around and see there's been 100%
###972 accurate fulfillment of what Moses
###973 said would happen after he died.
###975 We're living it.
###977 Moses also wrote about the Messiah--that he would come.
###981 He wrote that the people would be scattered.
###983 It's interesting reading those chapters
###985 and reading Josephus side by side.
###987 It's just incredible-- the detail that's in there.
###989 He wrote that the people after they were scattered,
###991 they'd be persecuted;
###993 and then also that they'd be regathered.
###995 And so down through the centuries, as people would
###998 ask, "You know, how do we know what Moses wrote here
###1002 about the origin of the universe, about the origin
###1006 of mankind, about the origin of evil and sin,
###1008 origin of death, how to escape sorrow,
###1010 the source of joy, eternal life--
###1012 all this critical information, how do we know it's right?"
###1014 Well, all they needed to do is look around
###1017 and they would see what Moses wrote was being
###1019 fulfilled in their very lifetime.
###1021 And they could look back in history--over a long span--and
###1024 they could see, "Yeah, it's just happened--
###1025 the way it played out."
###1027 And so, what was happening there was that 'must-know'
###1029 information was being verified by prophetic events.
###1034 And I think it's tragic that we've come to a point
###1037 in our church (I'm talking about in a global sense),
###1041 where people don't want to talk about prophecy.
###1044 You know it's divisive, so we don't talk about it.
###1047 We use little jokes: "I'm not a 'a-mil,' or 'post-mil' or
###1051 'pre-mil'; I'm a 'pan-mil'--it's all going to pan out in the end."
###1054 We do this sort of thing, you know.
###1056 But the thing is: what we're doing is we're taking one of
###1058 the very powerful pieces of God's architecture in the
###1062 Word of God and we're just throwing it out the window.
###1065 Now, I don't think we should go around and just nail
###1068 dates down and be hyper- dogmatic about some of
###1072 some of this stuff. Let's leave it a little open here.
###1075 But let's say we can use words like,
###1076 "It seems to be..." "It looks like it might...."
###1080 And if we disagree, let's disagree without
###1082 being disagreeable.
###1083 But lets not stop talking about prophecy in Scripture.
###1087 I've read that 27% of Scripture is prophecy--
###1091 much of which has been fulfilled.
###1092 It's a very potent airplane of truth
###1096 that we want to have flying in our formation.
###1099 Let's go on.
###1101 The types reveal and anchor doctrines--
###1106 types that we find in Scripture.
###1109 We're going to look at this area of what it reveals first.
###1112 And what I want us to do is: I want us to start
###1114 by looking at the Passover.
###1116 And we know that the Passover was--
###1120 came as a result of the tenth plague.
###1122 Now here's the Israelites: they're in Egypt;
###1125 they've been in bondage there;
###1126 they're slaves in hard labor.
###1128 And God brings these plagues along to cause
###1132 the Pharaoh to release the Israelites from Egypt.
###1138 Now that's not the only reason.
###1140 I think there's more there; we don't have time to go there.
###1143 He brought these plagues along, and the tenth one
###1147 was to be the death of the firstborn, remember that?
###1150 And…how many here are the firstborns?
###1155 Put up your hand.
###1157 Now, when you heard these instructions, if you were
###1159 back then, you would have listened very carefully.
###1161 You'd be taking notes. You'd say,
###1163 "Hold it, Moses, slow down, slow down, slow down."
###1167 First of all, they were to take a lamb.
###1170 (We're not going to look at the whole Passover.)
###1173 Here's my lamb right here. I know it's small,
###1175 but it's cold in Canada, and they don't grow big.
###1178 So, here's my lamb.
###1180 They were told to take a lamb--
###1182 and remember it had to be a male.
###1184 That was the gender-- it had to be a male.
###1186 And then it was to be without blemish--it couldn't have the
###1189 wool falling out. It couldn't have a broken leg
###1191 or anything like that.
###1193 They were to kill it at the appointed day
###1195 and the appointed hour--
###1197 there was a time they were to do this.
###1200 Now think, this is kind of a strange thing.
###1203 Can you imagine the instructions?
###1205 I mean, this is to prevent the death
###1207 of the first-born child.
###1209 Why didn't he just say,
###1210 "Go and lay in bed for the full day."?
###1213 Why didn't he do that?
###1215 No, we're getting this very elaborate--
###1217 and like I said, we're not going to look at it all.
###1219 This is what they're to do here.
###1221 And you're supposed to kill it;
###1224 and when you kill it, shed its blood.
###1225 Don't hit it over the head with a club. You are to
###1228 kill it in such a way that you shed its blood; and
###1230 then you are to take its blood and you're to apply
###1232 it to the doorposts and the lintel of the house.
###1235 So we see this animal to be killed, and the blood
###1239 is to be put on--can you see it over there?
###1242 It's to be put on the door posts
###1243 and the lintel of the house.
###1246 Now, that's what they are to do.
###1248 Then they're to stay in the house: go inside the door,
###1252 stay in the house, and partake of the animal;
###1256 and while they do this, don't break any of its bones.
###1258 Now, you think about that-- what a strange prescription
###1263 of events to prevent the death of the firstborn.
###1267 What was going on here?
###1269 What we were told--that if they would do this,
###1272 that when the death angel came, he would pass over
###1276 that house in judgment. He would pass over it.
###1280 Now, what was that all about?
###1282 Well, this was a picture; it was an illustration.
###1287 And what it was a picture of was...
###1295 The Passover was a prophetic picture of
###1298 something that was going on here.
###1299 Now, what was it?
###1301 It was the picture of the substitutionary work
###1303 of Jesus Christ.
###1305 You see, just as they were asked to take a lamb,
###1309 the Scripture tells us that John the Baptist, upon seeing
###1312 Jesus, he says, "Look, the…
###1315 Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world."
###1318 Jesus was called the Lamb of God.
###1321 And just as the Passover lamb had to a male,
###1325 so Jesus was a man.
###1327 And just as the Passover lamb had to be without blemish,
###1330 so Jesus was without sin.
###1333 And just as the Passover lamb was kept until the appointed
###1336 time and even the appointed hour,
###1338 and then he died, so Jesus died on the appointed day.
###1341 I believe it was the Passover at the appointed hour--it was
###1344 3:00 in the afternoon, the hour of the evening sacrifice.
###1347 Right on schedule.
###1350 And then just as the Passover lamb was not to have its
###1355 bones broken, when Jesus was on the cross,
###1358 they didn't break his bones either.
###1360 And just as by staying inside the house, that was
###1363 the only place they could find safety, it's so only
###1366 in Jesus Christ that we find safety from eternal death.
###1371 And just as back in those days (in the days of Moses)
###1375 where the Bible says that if they did that,
###1378 and by faith they trusted the Lord YHWH,
###1381 and believed that His words were true, and they just
###1383 put their confidence that-- yes, you know, maybe the
###1385 first born was sitting there and he's biting his nails,
###1387 and he was worrying away, but he didn't need
###1390 to worry--because it was all taken care of.
###1394 When the death angel came, he passed over that house.
###1398 Why? Because judgment had already come
###1400 to rest on the lamb.
###1402 In Egypt that night, there was a death in every household.
###1405 There was either the death of the firstborn,
###1408 or there was a death of the lamb.
###1411 But, if they had followed what God had said, and by faith
###1414 just trusted God and his word, the Bible says that
###1417 when the death angel came, he passed over that house--
###1421 wherever judgment had already come
###1423 to rest upon the lamb.
###1426 And you see, the same thing applies to us--
###1427 just as the lamb died in place of the first born,
###1430 so the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ died
###1432 in our place: He was our substitute.
###1435 This is talking about the substitionary work of Christ.
###1439 And when God comes in judgment to judge the world,
###1442 His judgment will pass over us. Why?
###1446 Because it's already come to rest on our Lamb.
###1452 The types of Scripture reveal to us certain doctrines,
###1457 like the substitutionary work of Christ.
###1458 It really nails it down in our mind.
###1461 And the interesting thing is, is that this is something
###1463 unique to Scripture.
###1465 It's also a form of prophecy.
###1467 And you only find it in the Scriptures.
###1472 You don't find it anywhere else. You don't find it in the
###1476 Quran; you don't find it in any of the other scriptures out there.
###1480 You can't go to the Gita, or the Vetas--no, it's not in those.
###1484 This is something--the whole idea of prophetic text
###1487 is very, very unique to the Bible.
###1490 And it's extremely powerful.
###1493 You know, as we use this in our teaching, we find you
###1496 see people sitting there; they're just gripped by it.
###1501 It's like a riddle.
###1502 You know, when someone gives you a riddle, you
###1503 sit there and it's all like-- ah, man, I can't get this.
###1506 And then all of a sudden, you get it and it's like--bing!
###1510 And it's like your eyes pop open, the scales fall
###1513 off and it's like--"Ahh!" "Oh!" And then you're one
###1516 of those guys sitting in the room that's got it, and all the rest--
###1518 the rest are sitting there and…As we do this, as we
###1524 teach, we see people sit there, and you can
###1526 actually see in their faces when it pops off.
###1530 It just--on this last trip to India, Singapore, and
###1536 Korea--I remember when I was teaching there in Korea.
###1540 As I was getting to this point, all of a sudden
###1542 I tied the types together. This lady started tapping her cheeks.
###1546 And she was so excited, she started going
###1549 like this with her hands. And then she looked down
###1551 each side and she put her hands down.
###1554 But you could see it right in her;
###1557 you know, it just bubbled out the top,
###1560 because all of a sudden they got it. It clicked.
###1566 They know what it's all about. They could see it--
###1569 Jesus is my Passover Lamb; He's my subtistute.
###1577 Very very powerful stuff. Very powerful prophecy.
###1580 It's something that we want to have flying
###1582 in our armada of truth.
###1586 Types not only reveal, but they also anchor doctrines.
###1589 And what do I mean by that?
###1591 Well, as an example, I'm going to use accuracy
###1595 in expression of salvation truths--
###1598 the accuracy in expression of salvation truths.
###1602 Now, stick with me here.
###1604 I want to take you to the tabernacle, and
###1608 I want to specifically look at the brazen altar.
###1611 Now, if you're visually challenged--and I find
###1614 some people just don't relate to something flat on a screen--
###1616 here's a 3D model of the tabernacle that you can
###1619 get from us and it will really help you in your teaching.
###1622 We're looking at the brazen altar right here.
###1625 That's what's in question. All right?
###1628 And what they were told--and we're just really jumping
###1630 forward here--the people back then (if you look in Leviticus),
###1633 it says that they were to bring an offering.
###1636 It had to be from the herd or the flock--
###1638 you couldn't bring a crocodile or a pig or something like
###1642 that--it had to be from the herd or the flock.
###1643 It had to be a male; it had to be without blemish.
###1646 And what they had to do, they had to bring this
###1648 to the brazen altar--they were going to make an offering there.
###1652 I'll set this down here for a moment.
###1656 I want to take this one here--
###1657 it's not brazen--but you got the idea, OK?
###1660 And they were to bring it to this altar.
###1663 And what they were to do is: they were
###1665 to place their hand on the head of that animal.
###1669 Now, what was going on here I believe, is that what
###1672 the Bible communicates is like the person is
###1673 saying, "I deserve to die for my sin; but I'm putting
###1676 "faith that God's word, what he's given here, is true.
###1679 "And it's as though my sin is being transferred
###1682 from me to this animal.
###1684 And when that happens, this animal dies in my place."
###1687 What we see here with this hands on the head, we see
###1691 that concept of substitution being brought out here again.
###1695 And it's a very powerful picture that you
###1697 can elaborate on and deal with.
###1700 Now the reason why this is brought out this way,
###1704 I believe, is because once again, when we get to the
###1706 New Testament, we see that…
###1712 We're dealing with a substitution issue here.
###1716 And this altar picture here--what we see going
###1719 on here--is actually to help us understand what went
###1723 on the cross, when Jesus Christ took our sin;
###1727 it was transferred from us on to him.
###1730 He became our sin bearer, and he died in our place.
###1733 It's all about substitution.
###1735 And I really believe that's the core issue of the gospel--is
###1737 substitution, substitutionary work of Christ.
###1740 Now, when we're expressing salvation truths,
###1745 we want to couch our vocabulary in that sense;
###1748 we want to use vocabulary that communicates
###1753 the substitutionary work of Christ.
###1755 But do we do that all the time?
###1757 Well, you know, what do you do with something like this?
###1766 Now, you're driving down the road, an unbeliever;
###1768 you're totally paganized, and you see that.
###1773 You've heard about this Jesus guy a little bit.
###1777 Is he a medical doctor?
###1780 Is he into heart transplants, or what?
###1783 Now, we have a problem here.
###1785 And you know, we use all sorts of little phrases that codify
###1790 what it means to be a Christian.
###1793 This is just one of them, as you know.
###1796 But, we have a problem, because if we go back
###1798 to our picture here, here we are--we're standing here.
###1803 And just pretend for a moment:
###1805 I've brought my sacrifice to the brazen altar.
###1807 Here we are. I've come and I'm just very weighed down
###1811 with a consciousness and how sinful I am.
###1813 And I come, and I look at that lamb.
###1817 I put my hand on its head and say,
###1819 "I'd like to give my heart to you."
###1825 You know, the lamb looks up and says, "Well, I'm
###1829 not going to be around here in a few minutes, you know."
###1835 Or maybe I bring my sacrifice and I come to the brazen altar.
###1840 And I put my hand on its head; and I look
###1844 at the lamb, and say, "I'd like to give you my heart,
###1849 or I'd like to give you my life."
###1852 The lamb says, "That's very nice, but once again, I'm not
###1855 going to be around in a few minutes."
###1857 It doesn't fit the picture. You get the idea?
###1861 What we need to do is-- we need to run
###1865 our terminology past the altar.
###1869 And we need to be sure that when we do, that it
###1871 honestly and sincerely reflects what's going on here.
###1874 And the fact is that I'm a sinner, weighed down
###1877 with the guilt and the weight of sin. And I desperately
###1880 need a substitute, and God has provided it in Jesus Christ.
###1884 We need to run our terminology past there.
###1887 Now, if we do that, we won't be reflecting
###1889 accurately what Jesus Christ did on the cross,
###1891 and we'll get into all sorts of things.
###1893 I really like the way Trevor McIllwain expressed this;
###1895 I just got to give this to you.
###1930 I just can't think of a better way to say it.
###1932 We got to make sure that we're accurate in expression.
###1935 And you know what? The types that we
###1937 find in Scripture help anchor the way we express it.
###1941 Here, look at another thing.
###1942 It not only anchors our expression,
###1944 it anchors our content.
###1946 You know, I believe that the Scripture tells us that
###1948 Jesus Christ--he died for sins once for all--and that when
###1951 we put our trust in Him, we are secure in Christ;
###1953 we can't lose our salvation.
###1956 You come back to this picture here--
###1958 the idea of placing your hands on the head there.
###1961 It was the picture of identification.
###1963 You were identifying with this substitute.
###1966 It was though one's sins was being transferred
###1969 from yourself to that substitute.
###1971 That was the idea.
###1973 It was your sins were being imputed to it.
###1976 But if you could lose your salvation, now think
###1979 for a moment here, if you could lose your salvation,
###1982 you would have to somehow reverse this process.
###1986 Now, I don't know what that would look like,
###1989 but I took a guess here.
###1995 You don't see this in the Scriptures. You don't.
###2001 We could look at another part of the tabernacle.
###2004 You know, here's the veil, that was between the
###2007 Holy of Holies, where God's presence symbolically
###2010 was exhibited right there over the top
###2012 of that mercy seat-- between the two cherubim,
###2015 and the Holy Place. And that veil--it held man out.
###2021 It protected God's holiness.
###2023 But we see there that when Jesus died on the cross,
###2026 "It is finished," he bowed his head, gave up his spirit.
###2030 And it says in Luke that the curtain of the temple
###2033 was torn in two from top to bottom.
###2035 And Hebrews explains that what that was: that was the picture
###2039 of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ being torn
###2042 for you and me, so that a way could be open for us
###2045 to enter through that curtain right into God's presence.
###2047 It's an incredibly potent, powerful picture.
###2050 You know, I remember when I was working
###2052 with New Tribes Mission-- this happened a number
###2053 of years ago when my son was just
###2054 five or six years of age-- just a little boy.
###2058 And I was sitting in a leadership conference;
###2061 I was doing some teaching there. And they had this
###2063 elevated stool that I was sitting on, so I was kinda
###2065 looking down on all the rest of the leaders there
###2067 in this big conference room--big oval table there,
###2070 by the lectern and everything. And we're sitting there and
###2073 talking; all these older men are sitting there--
###2076 very important individuals.
###2078 All of a sudden, the door bangs open--'Bang!'--and
###2081 there stands my son with a glass of water.
###2084 And he just marches right in. He walks by all these
###2087 important older men, and he walks right up to me
###2091 and he holds up this glass to me.
###2095 Now, that's the picture here. Because the reason was--
###2097 why my son had no fear of coming boldly into their
###2101 presence, boldly into my presence--was because I was
###2104 his…father.
###2109 And you see, that's what we have pictured here.
###2111 When that was torn, we has now that have put our faith
###2116 in what Jesus Christ did on the cross,
###2118 we enter boldly into God's presence,
###2120 because he's our…father.
###2125 Ahh! Powerful, isn't it? It's great stuff. Great stuff.
###2131 But if we could lose our salvation--
###2135 if we could lose our salvation--somehow
###2138 we'd have to be kicked out of the Holy of Holies,
###2142 and then this would have to be stitched back up.
###2146 You know what? We don't see that illustrated
###2149 in Scripture anywhere. We don't.
###2152 And so what we find is that not only do the types reveal
###2156 doctrines in the Scriptures, they help us understand the
###2159 substitutionary work of Christ, but they also
###2161 anchor these doctrines in such a way
###2162 to protect us from getting into error.
###2165 They keep us from shifting around;
###2167 it's like cement when you start studying those types--
###2170 you are just locked right down to what they are saying.
###2175 And, of course, the Scripture in the New Testament
###2177 is so good at just tying back in
###2179 and revealing this is exactly what was going on.
###2182 Well, I want to look at the third area, and that
###2185 has to do with the fact that stories define the words.
###2188 Now, we're really facing a crisis in our
###2191 human language philosophy here in the world,
###2196 and that is in this whole area that post-modernism--
###2199 and I'm sure a lot of you have studied post-modernism--
###2201 you at least know something about it.
###2203 Post-moderns believe that words no longer have…
###2205 well, they've never had meaning in their thinking.
###2207 And that is because word meaning changes.
###2210 At one time, the word 'gay' meant to be happy and
###2212 cheerful, but now it means to be…
###2213 it has a lifestyle connotation.
###2216 And so they say words-- the meanings shift.
###2219 You can't write something and expect it
###2222 to mean the same thing 50 years later.
###2226 Nor can one person necessarily interpret another
###2230 person's writing correctly, because the meaning
###2233 that is attached to words by another person
###2235 would be different from the one written.
###2237 And, there's an aspect of truthfulness in there.
###2240 Satan doesn't just tell a 100% lie; he mixes
###2245 truth in there; you know, he really muddles it up for us.
###2248 So post-moderns says that words don't have meaning.
###2250 So you can't really tell if something's right or not
###2253 because the meaning's been shifted around.
###2256 But the Bible actually uses stories to define words.
###2259 For example, if we were to look at the word 'grace'
###2261 in Scripture, this is the word that we use;
###2264 and we understand it to a certain extent.
###2266 But, we really--it's not really strong in our minds.
###2269 Especially, when you go out into the paganized culture
###2272 that we live in, the word 'grace' doesn't necessarily
###2275 have a whole lot of depth and meaning to it.
###2279 But, you can go into the Scriptures,
###2281 and you can tell the story about the children
###2283 of Israel being out in the wilderness, as God brought
###2286 them out of slavery-- horrible slavery.
###2289 He brought them out and he was leading them
###2291 to this land that he promised to them. And as he took
###2294 them there, he provided them with food.
###2296 He provided them water; he provided them with clothes.
###2299 They had shoes that didn't wear out.
###2301 He did all this for them, and, I think, we would all agree
###2305 that this was a wonderful statement of love.
###2308 Is that not right? It was.
###2310 And the people were so thankful and appreciative.
###2315 No. They grumbled and complained.
###2320 But what you see there is that God still showed love.
###2326 He didn't say, "Oh, you miserable crowd.
###2328 "I'm going to stop feeding you.
###2330 "In fact, just expect to get food on Tuesdays.
###2334 "The rest of the week you'll go hungry.
###2335 "And you'll be thankful for Tuesdays."
###2338 No, he didn't say that.
###2341 He didn't say, "Oh, everyone --barefoot from now on.
###2345 You'll be thankful for those shoes."
###2348 No, he just kept providing them faithfully--
###2351 day in and day out for 40 years.
###2354 He continued to show them love.
###2355 And you know what? I think we would all agree,
###2357 that hey, that was undeserved.
###2359 He didn't have to do that. And you know what?
###2362 That's the meaning of 'grace'-- it's undeserved love.
###2364 The story defines the word.
###2368 And now, when you think of the word 'grace,' you think
###2370 of that story and you think, "Oh, wow! Boy,
###2374 that's a neat God that's like that."
###2379 And we find that all the way through Scripture.
###2380 You know, where I come from-- Canada, we are running
###2383 into issues having to do with this matter of homosexuality.
###2386 And in Canada, if you went back 35-40 years ago,
###2392 homosexuality was considered a crime.
###2396 It was considered a perversion, a sin.
###2400 And you could be arrested; you could be imprisoned; you could
###2405 face severe consequences for having that lifestyle.
###2409 But now, here we are in 2006, and the last government
###2412 brought in and said, "Hey, not only is it OK, but we're going
###2416 "to sanction it by making it legal. You can get a marriage license,
###2419 "and you can become a married couple, and all the benefits
###2421 that go along with that can be yours, as a homosexual."
###2426 Now the word has been redefined as something
###2430 inappropriate to something that is appropriate.
###2432 But what does the Bible do?
###2435 Well, the Bible says, "Hold on, hold on, hold on here."
###2438 What it does is that it gives the definition for sexual
###2440 immorality and perversion. And what does it use?
###2443 It uses a story--Sodom and Gomorrah.
###2445 And it says that these serve as an example to those that are
###2449 going to suffer the punishment of eternal fire.
###2452 It calls it sexual immorality and perversion,
###2456 and it anchors it with a story. And the government of Canada
###2458 may want to say, "It's just fine,"
###2460 but the Bible is going to go on for eternity saying,
###2462 "No, and here's a story to illustrate what we mean by it."
###2465 And you can't get around the story.
###2467 The story locks it down; you can't change it.
###2471 You can try to shift the meaning of it, but you just
###2473 can't do that, because the story has locked the
###2476 definition of the term in place as defined as sin.
###2480 And this is all throughout Scripture.
###2481 Now, I'm going to throw out a word here,
###2483 and I want you to respond to me and tell me the
###2485 story that defines this word.
###2487 Here's the word....What's the story that defines it?
###2491 Hmm?
###2493 Abraham. There you are. Yeah.
###2495 Abraham defines it.
###2497 So, here's the story and it defines--
###2499 gives the definition for faith.
###2501 Now, if you want to know what faith is and what
###2504 it isn't, then what should you do?
###2507 Well, I believe, you need to go back and
###2509 give a real serious study to the life of Abraham.
###2514 And you do that, and you will find that when you do
###2517 that, it will tell you just what faith is like,
###2519 and what it isn't. Now, I may step on a few toes here in
###2523 what I'm going to do here in a moment; but I'm going
###2525 to tell you something, and when you do that--
###2526 there's a real popular thinking of faith out there
###2529 that I don't think is Scriptural--and what you
###2531 won't find, you'll find that faith is not a gift.
###2535 There's no where in Scripture where God (YHWH)
###2539 gave Abraham a gift of faith.
###2543 It's just not there.
###2544 Fact, you'll find the faith that he exhibited is very
###2546 much the sort of faith that you're showing right now
###2548 as you sit on these chairs-- hoping that whoever built
###2551 this building did a good job with the structural steel,
###2553 and the roof is going to stay up.
###2556 The stories define the words. And we can actually say
###2560 that probably it helps to stay out of error.
###2562 Now, we need to look at those stories and see how they
###2565 define words, how they are using it and then
###2567 that needs to determine our theology.
###2569 Well, the fourth one--this will be the last one
###2571 that we'll look at-- I believe that the Bible
###2574 uses word pictures to anchor doctrines.
###2576 Now, what do I mean by word pictures?
###2578 Well, an example of a word picture would be redemption--
###2582 the idea of being redeemed.
###2585 We know that the idea of being redeemed was a word
###2588 that came out of the slave market, remember that?
###2591 It had the idea of a slave that was chained.
###2594 So the picture for us is that we are individuals that
###2597 were chained by sin in the slave market of life.
###2602 There we are. There's nothing we could do to escape.
###2604 We're humbled; we're shamed;
###2606 we're stuck. There's nothing that we
###2609 could do to save ourselves, and yet the
###2613 Bible says that Jesus Christ came and he bought us.
###2616 What did he buy us with? His blood.
###2619 He bought us with His blood.
###2621 He took us out of the slave market and he
###2623 broke off those chains and he set us free.
###2626 That's the idea. Redemption.
###2629 And it's very, very powerful--
###2630 the whole idea of this word picture.
###2634 And remember, I said I don't believe that
###2636 you can lose your salvation; but if you could,
###2639 somehow in Scripture you would need a
###2641 word picture that says you could be un-redeemed.
###2645 We don't find that. Or maybe de-redeemed.
###2647 I'm not sure which way you would go there.
###2650 But then most people that believe that, also believe that
###2653 you could be re-redeemed.
###2655 So what you would have is: you'd have, here's your slave
###2660 sitting there; he's all chained and tied up. And then
###2662 he gets re-deemed; so he's happy. Then he's
###2664 un-redeemed; then he's re-redeemed; then he's a
###2665 slave; then he's re-redeemed, un-redeemed,
###2667 then he's re-redeemed.
###2669 You don't find anywhere where there's word pictures
###2673 in the Bible that illustrate that.
###2676 These word pictures really anchor certain truths.
###2680 What about the word 'justified'?
###2682 Very, very powerful truth.
###2686 I want to just use a visual aid here
###2688 that I think will help there.
###2691 When we teach on the area of sin,
###2695 we talk about sin as being
###2698 about our human dilemma-- if you want to call it.
###2701 When Adam and Eve sinned in the garden, a dilemma
###2703 entered into the human race. And this dilemma that
###2707 we face is like a coin that has two sides.
###2710 You can't divide these issues, really.
###2712 The human dilemma on the one side is that we face
###2716 a sin consequence; we face a penalty or a debt--
###2719 whichever way you want to phrase it--
###2721 that we're going to have to pay.
###2724 Now, we not only endure consequences in our
###2726 lifetime with shame and guilt and suffering and
###2729 anger--all those things that go along with that--
###2733 but we also face death, in a physical sense.
###2737 This is all consequences of sin.
###2739 And then the Bible says we face this thing called
###2741 'the second death,' which is an eternity in the lake of fire.
###2746 And we're facing an eternity of judgment.
###2750 And so there's this horrible consequence to our sin that
###2753 we're facing. And as we look at it, we see that there's just
###2757 no way that we can escape this on our own; we're stuck.
###2761 And so we have something here
###2763 that we really don't want-- about our dilemma.
###2768 But there's another side to our dilemma and that is that
###2770 there's something that we need.
###2772 If we're going to live in God's presence for eternity,
###2775 or even for briefly, we would need perfection.
###2779 'Without holiness no man can see God.'
###2781 There's--we would need to be as perfect as he is perfect.
###2784 We would have to have a righteousness that is
###2786 equal to his righteousness just to be in his presence.
###2789 And we don't have that. So, we face this problem:
###2794 How can I get this that I don't have?
###2798 And how can I get rid of this that I have?
###2802 You see, it's a two- sides-of-the-coin dilemma
###2806 that we face here.
###2808 Now, what I believe we can do here is: I believe
###2813 we can illustrate this with the doctrine of justification.
###2817 Paul, can you come down and help me here?
###2820 And, Shawn, could you give me a hand?
###2824 If you guys could just face me here. All right.
###2829 I believe that what the Scripture tells us is that when
###2832 God first created mankind, when we were first created…
###2839 (Come forward as far as you can, fellows.)
###2842 When God first created us, we were
###2844 created innocent of all sin. OK?
###2849 We didn't know anything about sin.
###2851 All we knew was the goodness of God.
###2855 Back in that garden of Eden, the Bible talks
###2857 about how God was man's best friend.
###2860 He would come and he would walk with man in the cool
###2863 of the day. And it's illustrated that there was
###2867 a friendship, a communion between God and man.
###2871 There was a fellowship. But then something happened.
###2876 The Bible talks about how, remember how Satan, in the
###2878 form of a serpent, came into the garden,
###2881 and he questioned something that God had said.
###2886 God had said, "You see that tree over there?
###2890 "Don't eat of its fruit,
###2892 because the day you eat of it, you will die."
###2895 Now, God in his love had given a whole forest,
###2899 a whole, a world of fruit they could eat from;
###2902 but he said, "Just that one; don't eat of it."
###2904 You might want to call it--it was like a friendship test.
###2907 Do you trust me? And every day they didn't eat of it,
###2912 it was like saying, "Yeah, we do."
###2914 But, when Satan came into the garden, he said,
###2916 "Did God really say that?
###2919 "Ha! God knows that the day you eat of it,
###2921 why, you're going to be an enlightened one."
###2924 (That's by the way what a Buddha is.)
###2926 OK? "You're going to be an enghtened one."
###2929 Adam and Eve were faced with this equation here--
###2934 and the equation was this: God said, "Don't eat of the tree
###2938 because you will die." Satan said, "Go ahead eat of it--
###2943 the day you eat of it you'll be enlightened; you'll be like God."
###2947 So they had to weigh out in their mind--who's
###2950 telling us the truth; who is our real friend?
###2954 And you know what?
###2957 The Bible tells us that Adam and Eve trusted a stranger.
###2960 They trusted someone that they didn't know
###2962 his identity, and they didn't know his history.
###2965 They knew that God was good.
###2967 They knew his identity, and they knew his
###2969 history; but they didn't trust him.
###2972 They trusted a stranger and they threw aside--
###2974 they cast aside their innocence. And when
###2977 they did that, when they did that, they took on a sin nature.
###2987 They became sinful.
###2994 (I knew there was something difficult about sin, but…)
###2999 OK. They took on a sin nature.
###3003 They rebelled against God; they disobeyed him--
###3007 they went his own way. They had trusted Satan instead of God.
###3011 And when that happened, God set aside
###3013 his mantle of friendship.
###3015 He set that aside, and it's like he put on a cloak--
###3021 the cloak of a pure, perfect judge.
###3030 Put on a cloak of a pure, perfect judge.
###3033 There was at that point-- what happened--there was a
###3036 separation that occurred between God and man,
###3040 because sinful man could not live in the presence
###3042 of the pure, perfect God.
###3044 {You need the gavel, right? There you are.)
###3050 Now, as man stood in God's courtroom, and as God
###3054 looked at man, he said, "You know what?
###3057 "You are guilty of breaking my law.
###3062 Even if it was just that one rule, you are guilty."
###3065 And so, we find that God declared man guilty
###3067 [crack!] in his presence.
###3070 OK, that's the verdict that has come down.
###3072 Man is standing there, and he's facing this two-sides-
###3075 of-the-same-coin dilemma.
###3076 He has this sin consequence that he's facing because
###3079 he's a guilty sinner. He's going to have
###3080 to pay this forever penalty-- this forever debt.
###3083 And he can't be in God's presence,
###3085 he can't come back in his presence, because he
###3087 doesn't have perfection-- he doesn't have that
###3089 righteousness that's equal to God's righteousness.
###3091 He's in an awful dilemma. And that's where man is stuck.
###3096 But the story doesn't stop there.
###3098 What we see is that God set aside his gavel.
###3103 He set aside his gavel, and he came to earth as the pure,
###3107 perfect person--came to earth as Jesus Christ.
###3116 So he came to earth.
###3121 OK, there you go.
###3126 Came to earth in the person of Jesus Christ.
###3127 And for a period of time, for 30-plus years, he walked
###3131 on the face of the globe that man could see the fact
###3134 that he was indeed the one who was the Lamb of God--
###3138 that one without blemish.
###3140 The one that was entirely
###3141 complete and able to take away the sin of the world.
###3145 He didn't just come to live a good example for
###3148 man; he came for the purpose of taking
###3150 man's sin off himself and on himself.
###3155 And that's what he did-- when he went to the cross.
###3159 When he went to the cross, what he did is:
###3161 he took the consequences of sin upon himself.
###3164 He took care of this side of the equation.
###3167 What he did on the cross is: he became
###3168 the sin bearer and he paid that eternal penalty,
###3171 that eternal debt. In one moment in time, as an
###3174 infinite God, he took care of it just like that.
###3177 And he was able to do something on the cross
###3180 that we could have never have done.
###3182 If we had tried to pay for the debt,
###3184 we would have gone on for eternity paying and paying
###3186 and paying and paying; but in one moment in time,
###3188 he was able to pay that debt and he said, "It is finished."
###3191 It's all done.
###3192 But that's not the end of the story.
###3196 You see, he took care of the sin
###3200 consequences on the cross. But then as a result
###3205 of doing that, he could say that, "If you believe that
###3207 "when I was dying on that cross, I was taking care
###3209 of it for you, I have something more for you."
###3212 Do you believe that Jesus Christ died in your place?
###3214 You do. Well then, you know what? God says that
###3217 if you believe that he died in your place,
###3220 then he wants to give you a gift.
###3222 He wants to clothe you in his righteousness.
###3225 And now, when you stand in God's courtroom,
###3227 and he lifts the gavel to look at you,
###3231 he no longer sees your sin; but he sees you
###3234 clothed in the righteousness of Christ.
###3237 And because he's the resurrected savior that's
###3240 come back to life, when he stands there and looks at you,
###3243 he doesn't say, "I declare you guilty";
###3245 rather, he says, "I declare you righteous in my eyes."
###3249 And that is the meaning of the word 'justified'--
###3253 [crack!] to be declared righteous.
###3257 That's the concept of justification.
###3260 Now, let me ask you a question.
###3262 And this is what I do with my students.
###3264 The devil shows up and he says, "Hmmm. Well, I'll fix that.
###3273 I'll just tear this righteousness off."
###3276 Could he do it?
###3278 The Bible tells us this righteousness comes from whom? God.
###3283 It has come from God.
###3285 The devil has no right meddling with it.
###3288 It's something that's been provided by him.
###3291 You can't tear it off.
###3293 I remember when I was teaching this out in India here a couple
###3296 years ago--a young man, his hands pop up
###3299 "Can Satan tear that off me?
###3302 Could somebody else rip it off me?"
###3304 I said, "Well, God's clothed you; he's put it there.
###3306 Who do you think would be able to take it off?"
###3309 "Oh, only God could."
###3311 "Well, he says he's not going to do that."
###3313 What he's done is, taken care of the other side of the coin--
###3318 he's taking care of the perfection side.
###3320 You are going to be able to live in his presence for
###3323 eternity not because of your righteousness,
###3326 but because he provided you with his righteousness.
###3329 And now clothed in his righteousness,
###3331 you are what we call "In Him"--"In Christ."
###3337 He's taken care of all you need to live with him.
###3341 You see, what this does, it shows us that when we are justified,
###3346 there's no such thing as being un-justified--
###3350 or de-justified.
###3353 In which case, we'd have to be able to be re-justified.
###3355 No, there's nothing like that out there.
###3359 What it shows us is that when we are provided with this,
###3362 by God from heaven, and he declares us righteous in his eyes,
###3366 then that's a final act.
###3368 And that's the word picture we find in Scriptures.
###3370 It's very, very powerful.
###3372 Thanks, fellows.
###3378 As we take advantage of the architecture of God's Word,
###3382 as we teach through the Scriptures as we have outlined,
###3389 it's a very, in many ways, it's a very condensed outline.
###3393 Some have said, "Oh, my, my, that's a thick book.
###3396 I don't know if I could ever get an unbeliever to read it."
###3398 Well, you know what? You'd be amazed at how it works.
###3401 If you're reading it just to yourself,
###3404 you can read it in about eight hours.
###3406 When we teach it and using the WorkBook and
###3408 all the visual aids, we can teach it in about 15 hours.
###3411 And, we find that there's a lot more people
###3416 that you'd imagine that are quite willing to sit down
###3418 and have an objective Bible presentation given to them.
###3422 They want to know about these things.
###3424 And it's because it's a big thing. And, you know, I
###3426 think it's uniquely a very Western thing, that what
###3430 we try to do with the Gospel is we try to say,
###3432 "How little can I get away with to get the guy saved?"
###3435 You know? We just kinda try and shrink it down.
###3438 We want to have the McDonald's mindset.
###3441 You know, when you drive through the drive through:
###3442 "Big Mac, order of fries, strawberry shake. Quick!
###3446 Come on, come on, come on, come on! Is this not fast food?"
###3449 And we want to have a fast gospel.
###3452 And we want to be able to list little things off there--bang!
###3455 But, you know what? In doing that, we do disservice
###3458 to the grandeur and the greatness of this message.
###3460 Generally speaking, in life, people that are making big
###3464 decisions give a little thought to it.
###3467 You know, when you go out to buy a house,
###3468 it's not something you get up in the morning
###3469 and on the way to work, you buy a house.
###3472 You don't do that. No.
###3474 You put a lot of thought into it, and you do some research.
###3478 Now, what we have found is that people are very appreciative
###3480 when you sit down and you are able to explain it through.
###3484 And as you do that: as you go from creation
###3486 through to Christ, you know what you are doing?
###3489 What you are doing is this: you're flying truths in formation.
###3493 Prophetic events are verifying the message.
###3496 Types are revealing and anchoring the doctrines
###3498 in the individual's mind.
###3500 Stories are defining the words for them so that they are making
###3503 sure that they're understanding exactly what you're talking about
###3505 when you're using words like sin, and God, and righteousness.
###3509 And the word pictures are anchoring those doctrines,
###3512 so you have absolutely no doubt what happened
###3514 on the cross and in the tomb.
###3517 And, I believe, that's what we want to do.
###3519 We want to take advantage of the architecture in the Bible.
###3522 We want to have truths flying in formation so that they
###3524 will protect each other.
###3526 So that it comes out with a very powerful statement
###3528 and it screams in the face of the individual: "This is true.
###3532 Please believe it."
###3535 And, I believe, that what it means when we talked about yesterday--
###3538 being an ambassador--when it says it's as though God himself
###3542 is speaking through us, and he's imploring a lost and dying world:
###3548 "Please, please, be reconciled to me."
###3553 If we don't do that, this is what we're doing,
###3557 so often. And what we're doing is, we're taking an
###3561 extrememly powerful airforce of truth,
###3565 and we're leaving most of it on the ground.
###3567 And we're sending off this one little truth, to fly by itself,
###3571 and we're saying, "Yep, it should do the trick."
###3574 When really what we need to be doing is,
###3576 we need to be putting our whole air force in the air
###3578 and saying, "Now listen folks, when we talk about
###3581 "the Scripture being inspired by God, this is what it means.
###3585 This is the face of it."
###3587 And when you fly this group of information together,
###3592 as you do that, it just has a very, very powerful
###3595 statement that, "Yes, it is true."
###3600 And that's why we do this.
###3602 That's why we're doing it.
