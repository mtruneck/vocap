Hi lovely people of Food tube.
I am in Malta. Look around, this fantastic


2
0:0:15,85 --> 0:0:22,59
16th Century square! And to celebrate where
I am. I'm going to make a fantastic zucotto


3
0:0:22,59 --> 0:0:26,88
pudding. Yeas it's so wonderful. So easy to
make!


4
0:0:26,88 --> 0:0:33,27
Let's start with a bowl, which I laid in with
some cling film. Some lovely biscuits. Sponge


5
0:0:33,27 --> 0:0:36,86
biscuits. Or you can use the pantone which
is good.


6
0:0:36,86 --> 0:0:42,78
Because I'm in Malta I'm using an Amoretti.
If you don't have an amoretti use a sweet


7
0:0:42,78 --> 0:0:50,7
liquor which is fantastic.
150ml. And then you make sure you wet it a


8
0:0:50,7 --> 0:0:56,339
little bit.
Once it's nice and soft, you lay in one, you


9
0:0:56,339 --> 0:1:3,379
press it.
You lay in two, you press it. Now slowly,


10
0:1:3,379 --> 0:1:9,14
slowly you can lay in one on top of the other.
Ever so easy!


11
0:1:9,14 --> 0:1:14,83
Don't worry if it's one long one short. It's
going to fold in anyway.


12
0:1:14,83 --> 0:1:24,46
So easy. Even your children can do that! Press
you hands properly inside. Make sure they're


13
0:1:24,46 --> 0:1:34,28
all nice and laid in.
Now bless them. Wash your hands nice and clean.


14
0:1:34,28 --> 0:1:37,39
The ricotta.
Now, here in Malta, we've got fantastic ricotta.


15
0:1:37,39 --> 0:1:46,27
This particular one is ever so melty, ever
so sweet. There's about 500grams of ricotta.


16
0:1:46,27 --> 0:1:55,28
Caster sugar, you need about 4 tablespoons,
oh yes. And then you mix it. Oh my, my, my.


17
0:1:55,28 --> 0:2:3,3
Have to be almost like cheesecake mix.
Now you've got some toasted almond flakes.


18
0:2:3,3 --> 0:2:13,99
Just put them inside. Yes! Just a half handful.
Fantastic mix candied fruit, handful. Straight


19
0:2:13,99 --> 0:2:16,59
in. Chocolate chips, who don't like chocolate
chips?


20
0:2:16,59 --> 0:2:24,65
Hallelujah! I love it.
Oh yeah. Have a mix. Have a look at that colour.


21
0:2:24,65 --> 0:2:30,239
It is incredible!
The bowl is already prepared. Pick it up.


22
0:2:30,239 --> 0:2:42,76
Half of the mix, press it. Biscuits, you press
it on top. Two, three. Don't be afraid to


23
0:2:42,76 --> 0:2:50,29
break it. Press it, press it press it.
With the rest I'm going to put one and half


24
0:2:50,29 --> 0:3:1,9
tablespoon of cocoa powder.
Then you mix it and it becomes like a chocolate.


25
0:3:1,9 --> 0:3:7,18
Cocoa powder itself is not very sweet, it's
a little bit bitter. So you lower a little


26
0:3:7,18 --> 0:3:14,629
bit of the sweetness of the desert. All in.
It's good.


27
0:3:14,629 --> 0:3:22,68
Spatula!
Press it. Now a few more biscuits on top.


28
0:3:22,68 --> 0:3:28,87
Then slowly press it. Don't be afraid. Little
clingfilms laying on top. You need to press


29
0:3:28,87 --> 0:3:35,239
it because you need all the food to combine
all together to be pressed altogether.


30
0:3:35,239 --> 0:3:44,139
Then, you've got a plate, put it on top, put
a weight on top. Put it in a fridge for all


31
0:3:44,139 --> 0:3:54,279
day and all night.
This is what I made yesterday. Yeah! Look


32
0:3:54,279 --> 0:3:59,689
at that! It's so perfect. It's not finished
yet.


33
0:3:59,689 --> 0:4:8,48
Cocoa powder. Because I need to stop that
little bit of sweetness, because it can be


34
0:4:8,48 --> 0:4:16,47
very sweet.
Are you ready? And look at that!


35
0:4:16,47 --> 0:4:25,699
I can't believe it! Come on! You can see the
almonds, you can see the candied fruit and


36
0:4:25,699 --> 0:4:30,66
the chocolate. The little layer of cocoa powder
and the ricotta is underneath. Right on the


37
0:4:30,66 --> 0:4:38,91
middle there is the sponge biscuit inside.
I am in 1600 Century square in Malta. It is


38
0:4:38,91 --> 0:4:50,93
a dream, so let's celebrate it.
Yes! Everything has come out! So what?! What


39
0:4:50,93 --> 0:5:2,139
a bit celebrations.
The flavour is incredible. You make it. Such


40
0:5:2,139 --> 0:5:8,78
joy to cook it and present it to you.
From my heart, I really mean it.
