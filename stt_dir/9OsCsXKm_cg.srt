1
0:0:0,12 --> 0:0:4,339
a bill passed us state senate up
comedian new jersey that would ban the


2
0:0:4,339 --> 0:0:7,7
practice of homosexual conversion
therapy that we thought that the other


3
0:0:7,7 --> 0:0:12,44
times on this show now love the governor
of new jersey first christy has


4
0:0:12,44 --> 0:0:15,469
previously seemed to indicate that he's
against it


5
0:0:15,469 --> 0:0:19,489
uh... we have a spokesman for murrieta
ca melaka spoke so uh... woman for


6
0:0:19,489 --> 0:0:21,5
discussed his campaign


7
0:0:21,5 --> 0:0:23,76
uh... there's no mistaking his point of
view on this


8
0:0:23,76 --> 0:0:26,97
when you look at is own prior statements
where he makes clear that people's


9
0:0:26,97 --> 0:0:28,359
sexual orientation


10
0:0:28,359 --> 0:0:30,13
is determined that birth


11
0:0:30,13 --> 0:0:34,5
uh... so he seems to be against it now
will he actually sign a bill that would


12
0:0:34,5 --> 0:0:36,35
ban this practice


13
0:0:36,35 --> 0:0:39,33
if that's still in question actually and
we've got a quote from him that leaves


14
0:0:39,33 --> 0:0:43,61
it very much open at this point he says
i'd love to mines just on this stuff in


15
0:0:43,61 --> 0:0:44,48
general


16
0:0:44,48 --> 0:0:47,42
number one i think there should be lots
of deference given the parents and


17
0:0:47,42 --> 0:0:48,74
raising their children


18
0:0:48,74 --> 0:0:52,53
until this is a general philosophy not
that he's built generally


19
0:0:52,53 --> 0:0:55,87
philosophically on bills that mister
testability


20
0:0:55,87 --> 0:0:59,16
to make decisions on how to care for
their children i'm generally a skeptic


21
0:0:59,16 --> 0:1:2,99
of those bills now there could always be
exceptions to those rules and this bill


22
0:1:2,99 --> 0:1:6,29
may be one of the yet his reasoning
doesn't make any sense of the reason i


23
0:1:6,29 --> 0:1:8,38
say that is because we have lost


24
0:1:8,38 --> 0:1:12,619
that prevents appearance for abusing
their kids and a conversion therapy is


25
0:1:12,619 --> 0:1:17,28
abuse there is this is where they use
electric shock therapy and we can you


26
0:1:17,28 --> 0:1:20,69
see it knowledge himself that
homosexuality is not a choice it's


27
0:1:20,69 --> 0:1:21,91
something that you're bored with


28
0:1:21,91 --> 0:1:25,77
so you can't change someone's sexuality
and in essence you're putting that child


29
0:1:25,77 --> 0:1:30,95
to torture so i don't want to present a
favorable bell you know as a moral opt


30
0:1:30,95 --> 0:1:34,28
passed in california that i was very
very happy about and i think that it


31
0:1:34,28 --> 0:1:37,62
would be responsible for chris christine
not to sign up now and i can not even


32
0:1:37,62 --> 0:1:41,46
sure what his justification would be
otherwise i mean we don't use unleashes


33
0:1:41,46 --> 0:1:45,37
anymore in a medical treatment so you
know with the in favor of that the


34
0:1:45,37 --> 0:1:49,48
parent dot that that was ok time need to
have my parental rights to but which is


35
0:1:49,48 --> 0:1:52,88
on my kids and they can get over the flu
or to stop being so


36
0:1:52,88 --> 0:1:57,13
returned to me and i did it doesn't make
any sense it's completely logical and


37
0:1:57,13 --> 0:2:1,289
knowing that he uh... chris christy is
up for re-election in november i'd think


38
0:2:1,289 --> 0:2:4,759
it's very interesting that they are
using this as rival and democratic


39
0:2:4,759 --> 0:2:10,459
senator barbara born is using that as
for uh... primary act act against the


40
0:2:10,459 --> 0:2:13,63
christian right now separate yeah of
course we should bear in mind that she's


41
0:2:13,63 --> 0:2:17,53
really losing by quite a bit now her her
name recognition obviously quite low


42
0:2:17,53 --> 0:2:20,599
levels to chris christie known around
the country so she is suffering from


43
0:2:20,599 --> 0:2:21,539
every now


44
0:2:21,539 --> 0:2:25,51
uh... such as jumping on the issues
using as part of our campaign report her


45
0:2:25,51 --> 0:2:29,109
is intolerance has no place in our state
the governor said he doesn't know much


46
0:2:29,109 --> 0:2:30,959
about gay conversion therapy


47
0:2:30,959 --> 0:2:33,149
but i don't know how much you need to
know


48
0:2:33,149 --> 0:2:34,65
it's a good point guard


49
0:2:34,65 --> 0:2:37,81
look i personally i'm in favor of more
information regardless of if it's uh...


50
0:2:37,81 --> 0:2:40,9
subject i personally find abort


51
0:2:40,9 --> 0:2:43,109
uh... now there's no surprise obviously
that you should jump on that she will


52
0:2:43,109 --> 0:2:45,729
jump on this it has jumped on this


53
0:2:45,729 --> 0:2:47,529
i think that


54
0:2:47,529 --> 0:2:51,37
you could have sort of a a debate look i
i would guess that the the conversion


55
0:2:51,37 --> 0:2:52,73
therapy obviously


56
0:2:52,73 --> 0:2:55,98
uh... it's easy for us to say that it's
torture i think that you could have


57
0:2:55,98 --> 0:2:59,92
counseling or something like that now
you can tell you if i understand i'm


58
0:2:59,92 --> 0:3:3,8
against it but i'm saying it's easy for
us to simply say it is tortured us you


59
0:3:3,8 --> 0:3:4,499
cannot


60
0:3:4,499 --> 0:3:7,519
but if we're looking to convince people
who think that it might be reasonable or


61
0:3:7,519 --> 0:3:10,539
currently in favor of it is not enough
to simply say it's torture


62
0:3:10,539 --> 0:3:14,859
son that's been a more detailed about
what the bill includes so it doesn't


63
0:3:14,859 --> 0:3:18,749
straight out bad a conversion there be
offensive for up people under the age of


64
0:3:18,749 --> 0:3:19,499
eighteen


65
0:3:19,499 --> 0:3:23,969
if you are tied to halt side you would
be able to get dating free conversion


66
0:3:23,969 --> 0:3:29,919
therapy obligor out not sure if god this
bill includes a bit in california fear


67
0:3:29,919 --> 0:3:33,419
above the age of eighteen he would have
to sign some sort of form indicating


68
0:3:33,419 --> 0:3:37,319
that you are aware that this is complete
and utter bullshit and it's not


69
0:3:37,319 --> 0:3:41,189
medically proven to work or anything
like that uh... but


70
0:3:41,189 --> 0:3:44,489
no i i don't even think that you should
have counseling that that tries to


71
0:3:44,489 --> 0:3:47,859
convince you that being gay is wrong and
you should become straight states not


72
0:3:47,859 --> 0:3:52,119
scientifically proven innocent either
child abuse and i've has forced kids to


73
0:3:52,119 --> 0:3:54,929
go into some kind of that their api to
talk to that


74
0:3:54,929 --> 0:3:57,889
a psychologist because his nose like
holidays i would hope


75
0:3:57,889 --> 0:4:1,389
that would agree with the idea that you
can actually get to talk there appear


76
0:4:1,389 --> 0:4:4,999
confident european order to not be
gaining via look at this industries


77
0:4:4,999 --> 0:4:8,849
right now dont having psychologists are
convinced of it but having like priests


78
0:4:8,849 --> 0:4:11,87
who want to get a room and to hug
therapy with these


79
0:4:11,87 --> 0:4:14,43
these kids who think that the medicare
fee what they are going after the


80
0:4:14,43 --> 0:4:18,37
landmark is sparkling and the kids as
rocks off by you know doing is they're


81
0:4:18,37 --> 0:4:22,53
that these therapy sessions and it's not
that it's in that very carefully setting


82
0:4:22,53 --> 0:4:24,489
out making up a tenant for this


83
0:4:24,489 --> 0:4:28,36
yet and let's bear in mind what's
probably underlying first receives for a


84
0:4:28,36 --> 0:4:31,999
waffling on this issue probably has less
to do with him not being as short work


85
0:4:31,999 --> 0:4:34,39
these days and he says that he is
against it


86
0:4:34,39 --> 0:4:37,379
which is admirable i think that if he
was not uh...


87
0:4:37,379 --> 0:4:40,569
i think that the election that's going
on right now for further get the


88
0:4:40,569 --> 0:4:43,24
governorship of new jersey ave
desperately was thinking about


89
0:4:43,24 --> 0:4:45,499
begins probably looking at between
sixteen


90
0:4:45,499 --> 0:4:49,59
now it's interesting because chris
christie has this mystique of being like


91
0:4:49,59 --> 0:4:53,5
the new rebel in the party like he's not
just about out anything


92
0:4:53,5 --> 0:4:55,86
the republican leadership says they
should do generally i think that makes


93
0:4:55,86 --> 0:4:57,189
sense because he does


94
0:4:57,189 --> 0:4:59,56
but the party line more than most


95
0:4:59,56 --> 0:5:2,82
but he's going to be entering into a
national rural republican primary


96
0:5:2,82 --> 0:5:6,919
contest and that's not the place where
being a rebel is going to to benefit you


97
0:5:6,919 --> 0:5:7,499
like


98
0:5:7,499 --> 0:5:10,179
there there are republicans who are very
much in favor of here at the present


99
0:5:10,179 --> 0:5:12,449
because they think that it could be a
democrat


100
0:5:12,449 --> 0:5:16,949
but that's very different story from
uh... beating other republicans in


101
0:5:16,949 --> 0:5:20,51
if he comes out strongly against it and
seems like he's too in favor


102
0:5:20,51 --> 0:5:22,85
of gay marriage and other gay rights
issues


103
0:5:22,85 --> 0:5:26,34
but that's gonna be positive from our
point of view but the people voting


104
0:5:26,34 --> 0:5:29,44
you know in iowa and new hampshire on
the republican side are necessarily


105
0:5:29,44 --> 0:7:29,44
donald gregg
