CANDY CROWLEY, MODERATOR: Good
evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead,


2
0:0:2,81 --> 0:0:7,359
New York. I'm Candy Crowley from CNN's
"State of the Union." We are here for


3
0:0:7,359 --> 0:0:11,889
the second presidential debate, a town hall,
sponsored by the Commission on Presidential


4
0:0:11,889 --> 0:0:15,23
Debates.\
CROWLEY: The Gallup organization chose 82


5
0:0:15,23 --> 0:0:20,3
uncommitted voters from the New York area.
Their questions will drive the night. My goal


6
0:0:20,3 --> 0:0:24,34
is to give the conversation direction and
to ensure questions get answered.\


7
0:0:24,34 --> 0:0:28,9
The questions are known to me and my team
only. Neither the commission, nor the candidates


8
0:0:28,9 --> 0:0:32,68
have seen them. I hope to get to as many questions
as possible.\


9
0:0:32,68 --> 0:0:36,16
CROWLEY: And because I am the optimistic sort,
I\'92m sure the candidates will oblige by


10
0:0:36,16 --> 0:0:40,88
keeping their answers concise and on point.\
Each candidate has as much as two minutes


11
0:0:40,88 --> 0:0:45,5
to respond to a common question, and there
will be a two-minute follow-up. The audience


12
0:0:45,5 --> 0:0:49,92
here in the hall has agreed to be polite and
attentive -- no cheering or booing or outbursts


13
0:0:49,92 --> 0:0:53,64
of any sort.\
We will set aside that agreement just this


14
0:0:53,64 --> 0:0:57,48
once to welcome President Barack Obama and
Governor Mitt Romney.\


15
0:0:57,48 --> 0:1:29,88
(APPLAUSE)\
Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us here


16
0:1:29,88 --> 0:1:33,109
tonight. We have a lot of folks who\'92ve
been waiting all day to talk to you, so I


17
0:1:33,109 --> 0:1:36,869
want to get right to it.\
Governor Romney, as you know, you won the


18
0:1:36,869 --> 0:1:42,9
coin toss, so the first question will go to
you. And I want to turn to a first-time voter,


19
0:1:42,9 --> 0:1:48,99
Jeremy Epstein, who has a question for you.\
QUESTION: Mr. President, Governor Romney,


20
0:1:48,99 --> 0:1:52,139
as a 20-year-old college student, all I hear
from professors, neighbors and others is that


21
0:1:52,139 --> 0:1:57,2
when I graduate, I will have little chance
to get employment. What can you say to reassure


22
0:1:57,2 --> 0:2:0,74
me, but more importantly my parents, that
I will be able to sufficiently support myself


23
0:2:0,74 --> 0:2:4,549
after I graduate?\
ROMNEY: Thank you, Jeremy. I appreciate your


24
0:2:4,549 --> 0:2:7,88
-- your question, and thank you for being
here this evening and to all of those from


25
0:2:7,88 --> 0:2:12,17
Nassau County that have come, thank you for
your time. Thank you to Hofstra University


26
0:2:12,17 --> 0:2:16,12
and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading
this -- this event.\


27
0:2:16,12 --> 0:2:19,34
Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part
of this -- this debate.\


28
0:2:19,34 --> 0:2:24,69
Your question -- your question is one that\'92s
being asked by college kids all over this


29
0:2:24,69 --> 0:2:28,609
country. I was in Pennsylvania with someone
who had just graduated -- this was in Philadelphia


30
0:2:28,609 --> 0:2:33,28
-- and she said, \'93I\'92ve got my degree.
I can\'92t find a job. I\'92ve got three part-


31
0:2:33,28 --> 0:2:37,469
time jobs. They\'92re just barely enough to
pay for my food and pay for an apartment.


32
0:2:37,469 --> 0:2:41,459
I can\'92t begin to pay back my student loans.\'94\
So what we have to do is two things. We have


33
0:2:41,459 --> 0:2:44,31
to make sure that we make it easier for kids
to afford college.\


34
0:2:44,31 --> 0:2:47,189
ROMNEY: And also make sure that when they
get out of college, there\'92s a job. When


35
0:2:47,189 --> 0:2:52,92
I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a
high school degree, you had to pass an exam.


36
0:2:52,92 --> 0:2:57,92
If you graduated in the top quarter of your
airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams


37
0:2:57,92 --> 0:3:2,519
scholarship, four years tuition free in the
college of your choice in Massachusetts, it\'92s


38
0:3:2,519 --> 0:3:6,53
a public institution.\
I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant


39
0:3:6,53 --> 0:3:10,25
program growing. We\'92re also going to have
our loan program, so that people are able


40
0:3:10,25 --> 0:3:14,239
to afford school. But the key thing is to
make sure you can get a job when you get out


41
0:3:14,239 --> 0:3:18,849
of school. And what\'92s happened over the
last four years has been very, very hard for


42
0:3:18,849 --> 0:3:22,69
America\'92s young people. I want you to be
able to get a job.\


43
0:3:22,69 --> 0:3:27,239
I know what it takes to get this economy going.
With half of college kids graduating this


44
0:3:27,239 --> 0:3:32,62
year without a college -- excuse me, without
a job. And without a college level job, that\'92s


45
0:3:32,62 --> 0:3:35,15
just unacceptable.\
And likewise you\'92ve got more and more debt


46
0:3:35,15 --> 0:3:39,969
on your back. So more debt and less jobs.
I\'92m going to change that. I know what it


47
0:3:39,969 --> 0:3:44,519
takes to create good jobs again. I know what
it takes to make sure that you have the kind


48
0:3:44,519 --> 0:3:48,89
of opportunity you deserve. And kids across
this country are going to recognize, we\'92re


49
0:3:48,89 --> 0:3:51,849
bringing back an economy.\
It\'92s not going to be like the last four


50
0:3:51,849 --> 0:3:56,379
years. The middle-class has been crushed over
the last four years, and jobs have been too


51
0:3:56,379 --> 0:3:59,29
scarce. I know what it takes to bring them
back, and I\'92m going to do that, and make


52
0:3:59,29 --> 0:4:0,79
sure that when you graduate -- when do you
graduate?\


53
0:4:0,79 --> 0:4:4,95
QUESTION: 2014.\
ROMNEY: 2014. When you come out in 2014, I


54
0:4:4,95 --> 0:4:8,299
presume I\'92m going to be president. I\'92m
going to make sure you get a job. Thanks Jeremy.


55
0:4:8,299 --> 0:4:11,519
Yeah, you bet.\
CROWLEY: Mr. President?\


56
0:4:11,519 --> 0:4:16,58
OBAMA: Jeremy, first of all, your future is
bright. And the fact that you\'92re making


57
0:4:16,58 --> 0:4:21,95
an investment in higher education is critical.
Not just to you, but to the entire nation.


58
0:4:21,95 --> 0:4:26,64
Now, the most important thing we can do is
to make sure that we are creating jobs in


59
0:4:26,64 --> 0:4:31,26
this country. But not just jobs, good paying
jobs. Ones that can support a family.\


60
0:4:31,26 --> 0:4:36,55
OBAMA: And what I want to do, is build on
the five million jobs that we\'92ve created


61
0:4:36,55 --> 0:4:40,93
over the last 30 months in the private sector
alone. And there are a bunch of things we


62
0:4:40,93 --> 0:4:46,61
can do to make sure your future is bright.\
Number one, I want to build manufacturing


63
0:4:46,61 --> 0:4:53,59
jobs in this country again. Now when Governor
Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt.


64
0:4:53,59 --> 0:4:57,32
I said we\'92re going to bet on American workers
and the American auto industry and it\'92s


65
0:4:57,32 --> 0:5:1,2
come surging back.\
I want to do that in industries, not just


66
0:5:1,2 --> 0:5:5,34
in Detroit, but all across the country and
that means we change our tax code so we\'92re


67
0:5:5,34 --> 0:5:9,7
giving incentives to companies that are investing
here in the United States and creating jobs


68
0:5:9,7 --> 0:5:12,51
here.\
It also means we\'92re helping them and small


69
0:5:12,51 --> 0:5:16,9
businesses to export all around the world
to new markets.\


70
0:5:16,9 --> 0:5:21,16
Number two, we\'92ve got to make sure that
we have the best education system in the world.


71
0:5:21,16 --> 0:5:25,3
And the fact that you\'92re going to college
is great, but I want everybody to get a great


72
0:5:25,3 --> 0:5:29,64
education and we\'92ve worked hard to make
sure that student loans are available for


73
0:5:29,64 --> 0:5:33,97
folks like you, but I also want to make sure
that community colleges are offering slots


74
0:5:33,97 --> 0:5:37,55
for workers to get retrained for the jobs
that are out there right now and the jobs


75
0:5:37,55 --> 0:5:40,66
of the future.\
Number three, we\'92ve got to control our


76
0:5:40,66 --> 0:5:46,5
own energy. Now, not only oil and natural
gas, which we\'92ve been investing in; but


77
0:5:46,5 --> 0:5:50,77
also, we\'92ve got to make sure we\'92re building
the energy source of the future, not just


78
0:5:50,77 --> 0:5:54,38
thinking about next year, but ten years from
now, 20 years from now. That\'92s why we\'92ve


79
0:5:54,38 --> 0:5:58,78
invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy
efficient cars.\


80
0:5:58,78 --> 0:6:2,57
We\'92ve got to reduce our deficit, but we\'92ve
got to do it in a balanced way. Asking the


81
0:6:2,57 --> 0:6:6,8
wealthy to pay a little bit more along with
cuts so that we can invest in education like


82
0:6:6,8 --> 0:6:8,49
yours.\
And let\'92s take the money that we\'92ve


83
0:6:8,49 --> 0:6:14,4
been spending on war over the last decade
to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools.


84
0:6:14,4 --> 0:6:17,69
We do those things, not only is your future
going to be bright but America\'92s future


85
0:6:17,69 --> 0:6:22,43
is going to bright as well.\
CROWLEY: Let me ask you for more immediate


86
0:6:22,43 --> 0:6:28,87
answer and begin with Mr. Romney just quickly
what -- what can you do? We\'92re looking


87
0:6:28,87 --> 0:6:32,38
at a situation where 40 percent of the unemployed
have been unemployed have been unemployed


88
0:6:32,38 --> 0:6:37,3
for six months or more. They don\'92t have
the two years that Jeremy has.\


89
0:6:37,3 --> 0:6:41,56
What about those long term unemployed who
need a job right now?\


90
0:6:41,56 --> 0:6:45,53
ROMNEY: Well what you\'92re seeing in this
country is 23 million people struggling to


91
0:6:45,53 --> 0:6:49,35
find a job. And a lot of them, as you say,
Candy, have been out of work for a long, long,


92
0:6:49,35 --> 0:6:54,95
long time. The president\'92s policies have
been exercised over the last four years and


93
0:6:54,95 --> 0:6:59,49
they haven\'92t put Americans back to work.\
We have fewer people working today than we


94
0:6:59,49 --> 0:7:4,18
had when the president took office. If the
-- the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when


95
0:7:4,18 --> 0:7:9,38
he took office, it\'92s 7.8 percent now. But
if you calculated that unemployment rate,


96
0:7:9,38 --> 0:7:13,89
taking back the people who dropped out of
the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.\


97
0:7:13,89 --> 0:7:17,27
We have not made the progress we need to make
to put people back to work. That\'92s why


98
0:7:17,27 --> 0:7:24,42
I put out a five-point plan that gets America
12 million new jobs in four years and rising


99
0:7:24,42 --> 0:7:27,85
take-home pay. It\'92s going to help Jeremy
get a job when he comes out of school. It\'92s


100
0:7:27,85 --> 0:7:31,48
going to help people across the country that
are unemployed right now.\


101
0:7:31,48 --> 0:7:35,64
And one thing that the president said, which
I want to make sure that we understand, he


102
0:7:35,64 --> 0:7:40,2
said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt.
And that\'92s right. My plan was to have the


103
0:7:40,2 --> 0:7:46,49
company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven
did and Macy\'92s and Condell (ph) Airlines


104
0:7:46,49 --> 0:7:49,73
and come out stronger.\
And I know he keeps saying, you want to take


105
0:7:49,73 --> 0:7:54,52
Detroit bankrupt. Well, the president took
Detroit bankrupt. You took General Motors


106
0:7:54,52 --> 0:7:59,98
bankrupt. You took Chrysler bankrupt. So when
you say that I wanted to take the auto industry


107
0:7:59,98 --> 0:8:3,89
bankrupt, you actually did.\
And I think it\'92s important to know that


108
0:8:3,89 --> 0:8:8,73
that was a process that was necessary to get
those companies back on their feet, so they


109
0:8:8,73 --> 0:8:13,57
could start hiring more people. That was precisely
what I recommended and ultimately what happened.\


110
0:8:13,57 --> 0:8:17,41
CROWLEY: Let me give the president a chance.\
Go ahead. OBAMA: Candy, what Governor Romney


111
0:8:17,41 --> 0:8:24,14
said just isn\'92t true. He wanted to take
them into bankruptcy without providing them


112
0:8:24,14 --> 0:8:29,67
any way to stay open. And we would have lost
a million jobs. And that -- don\'92t take


113
0:8:29,67 --> 0:8:35,31
my word for it, take the executives at GM
and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans,


114
0:8:35,31 --> 0:8:38,76
may even support Governor Romney. But they\'92ll
tell you his prescription wasn\'92t going


115
0:8:38,76 --> 0:8:40,94
to work.\
And Governor Romney\'92s says he\'92s got


116
0:8:40,94 --> 0:8:44,95
a five-point plan? Governor Romney doesn\'92t
have a five-point plan. He has a one-point


117
0:8:44,95 --> 0:8:51,74
plan. And that plan is to make sure that folks
at the top play by a different set of rules.


118
0:8:51,74 --> 0:8:55,61
That\'92s been his philosophy in the private
sector, that\'92s been his philosophy as governor,


119
0:8:55,61 --> 0:8:58,39
that\'92s been his philosophy as a presidential
candidate.\


120
0:8:58,39 --> 0:9:4,44
You can make a lot of money and pay lower
tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less.


121
0:9:4,44 --> 0:9:10,86
You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks
for it. You can invest in a company, bankrupt


122
0:9:10,86 --> 0:9:14,69
it, lay off the workers, strip away their
pensions, and you still make money.\


123
0:9:14,69 --> 0:9:21,33
That\'92s exactly the philosophy that we\'92ve
seen in place for the last decade. That\'92s


124
0:9:21,33 --> 0:9:27,64
what\'92s been squeezing middle class families.\
And we have fought back for four years to


125
0:9:27,64 --> 0:9:32,92
get out of that mess. The last thing we need
to do is to go back to the very same policies


126
0:9:32,92 --> 0:9:35,45
that got us there.\
CROWLEY: Mr. President, the next question


127
0:9:35,45 --> 0:9:38,74
is going to be for you here.\
And, Mr. Romney -- Governor Romney -- there\'92ll


128
0:9:38,74 --> 0:9:40,5
be plenty of chances here to go on, but I
want to...\


129
0:9:40,5 --> 0:9:40,9
ROMNEY: That -- that Detroit -- that Detroit
answer...\


130
0:9:40,9 --> 0:9:41,68
CROWLEY: We have all these folks.\
ROMNEY: ... that Detroit answer...\


131
0:9:41,68 --> 0:9:45,9
CROWLEY: I will let you absolutely...\
ROMNEY: ... and the rest of the answer, way


132
0:9:45,9 --> 0:9:47,26
off the mark.\
CROWLEY: OK. Will -- will -- you certainly


133
0:9:47,26 --> 0:9:50,68
will have lots of time here coming up.\
Because I want to move you on to something


134
0:9:50,68 --> 0:9:55,56
that\'92s sort of connected to cars here,
and -- and go over. And we want to get a question


135
0:9:55,56 --> 0:10:6,62
from Phillip Tricolla.\
QUESTION: Your energy secretary, Steven Chu,


136
0:10:6,62 --> 0:10:11,83
has now been on record three times stating
it\'92s not policy of his department to help


137
0:10:11,83 --> 0:10:17,95
lower gas prices. Do you agree with Secretary
Chu that this is not the job of the Energy


138
0:10:17,95 --> 0:10:22,67
Department?\
OBAMA: The most important thing we can do


139
0:10:22,67 --> 0:10:27,529
is to make sure we control our own energy.
So here\'92s what I\'92ve done since I\'92ve


140
0:10:27,529 --> 0:10:34,15
been president. We have increased oil production
to the highest levels in 16 years.\


141
0:10:34,15 --> 0:10:40,31
Natural gas production is the highest it\'92s
been in decades. We have seen increases in


142
0:10:40,31 --> 0:10:48,2
coal production and coal employment. But what
I\'92ve also said is we can\'92t just produce


143
0:10:48,2 --> 0:10:51,94
traditional source of energy. We\'92ve also
got to look to the future. That\'92s why we


144
0:10:51,94 --> 0:10:55,77
doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.
That means that in the middle of the next


145
0:10:55,77 --> 0:11:0,69
decade, any car you buy, you\'92re going to
end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas.


146
0:11:0,69 --> 0:11:5,66
That\'92s why we doubled clean -- clean energy
production like wind and solar and biofuels.\


147
0:11:5,66 --> 0:11:11,2
And all these things have contributed to us
lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels


148
0:11:11,2 --> 0:11:17,9
in 16 years. Now, I want to build on that.
And that means, yes, we still continue to


149
0:11:17,9 --> 0:11:24,29
open up new areas for drilling. We continue
to make it a priority for us to go after natural


150
0:11:24,29 --> 0:11:29,38
gas. We\'92ve got potentially 600,000 jobs
and 100 years worth of energy right beneath


151
0:11:29,38 --> 0:11:33,35
our feet with natural gas.\
And we can do it in an environmentally sound


152
0:11:33,35 --> 0:11:39,69
way. But we\'92ve also got to continue to
figure out how we have efficiency energy,


153
0:11:39,69 --> 0:11:42,84
because ultimately that\'92s how we\'92re
going to reduce demand and that\'92s what\'92s


154
0:11:42,84 --> 0:11:48,85
going to keep gas prices lower.\
Now, Governor Romney will say he\'92s got


155
0:11:48,85 --> 0:11:54,45
an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his
plan is to let the oil companies write the


156
0:11:54,45 --> 0:12:0,98
energy policies. So he\'92s got the oil and
gas part, but he doesn\'92t have the clean


157
0:12:0,98 --> 0:12:7,33
energy part. And if we are only thinking about
tomorrow or the next day and not thinking


158
0:12:7,33 --> 0:12:13,1
about 10 years from now, we\'92re not going
to control our own economic future. Because


159
0:12:13,1 --> 0:12:18,44
China, Germany, they\'92re making these investments.
And I\'92m not going to cede those jobs of


160
0:12:18,44 --> 0:12:23,32
the future to those countries. I expect those
new energy sources to be built right here


161
0:12:23,32 --> 0:12:25,73
in the United States.\
That\'92s going to help Jeremy get a job.


162
0:12:25,73 --> 0:12:28,8
It\'92s also going to make sure that you\'92re
not paying as much for gas.\


163
0:12:28,8 --> 0:12:34,8
CROWLEY: Governor, on the subject of gas prices?\
ROMNEY: Well, let\'92s look at the president\'92s


164
0:12:34,8 --> 0:12:38,43
policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric,
because we\'92ve had four years of policies


165
0:12:38,43 --> 0:12:44,6
being played out. And the president\'92s right
in terms of the additional oil production,


166
0:12:44,6 --> 0:12:49,1
but none of it came on federal land. As a
matter of fact, oil production is down 14


167
0:12:49,1 --> 0:12:53,43
percent this year on federal land, and gas
production was down 9 percent. Why? Because


168
0:12:53,43 --> 0:12:59,33
the president cut in half the number of licenses
and permits for drilling on federal lands,


169
0:12:59,33 --> 0:13:2,339
and in federal waters.\
So where\'92d the increase come from? Well


170
0:13:2,339 --> 0:13:7,18
a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in
North Dakota. What was his participation there?


171
0:13:7,18 --> 0:13:12,0
The administration brought a criminal action
against the people drilling up there for oil,


172
0:13:12,0 --> 0:13:18,35
this massive new resource we have. And what
was the cost? 20 or 25 birds were killed and


173
0:13:18,35 --> 0:13:21,98
brought out a migratory bird act to go after
them on a criminal basis.\


174
0:13:21,98 --> 0:13:29,4
Look, I want to make sure we use our oil,
our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.


175
0:13:29,4 --> 0:13:34,29
I believe very much in our renewable capabilities;
ethanol, wind, solar will be an important


176
0:13:34,29 --> 0:13:38,4
part of our energy mix.\
But what we don\'92t need is to have the president


177
0:13:38,4 --> 0:13:44,55
keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal
and gas. This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr.


178
0:13:44,55 --> 0:13:48,92
Gas, or Mr. Coal. Talk to the people that
are working in those industries. I was in


179
0:13:48,92 --> 0:13:54,149
coal country. People grabbed my arms and said,
\'93Please save my job.\'94 The head of the


180
0:13:54,149 --> 0:13:58,87
EPA said, \'93You can\'92t build a coal plant.
You\'92ll virtually -- it\'92s virtually impossible


181
0:13:58,87 --> 0:14:2,95
given our regulations.\'94 When the president
ran for office, he said if you build a coal


182
0:14:2,95 --> 0:14:7,29
plant, you can go ahead, but you\'92ll go
bankrupt. That\'92s not the right course for


183
0:14:7,29 --> 0:14:9,79
America.\
Let\'92s take advantage of the energy resources


184
0:14:9,79 --> 0:14:15,26
we have, as well as the energy sources for
the future. And if we do that, if we do what


185
0:14:15,26 --> 0:14:21,17
I\'92m planning on doing, which is getting
us energy independent, North America energy


186
0:14:21,17 --> 0:14:26,44
independence within eight years, you\'92re
going to see manufacturing jobs come back.


187
0:14:26,44 --> 0:14:31,21
Because our energy is low cost, that are already
beginning to come back because of our abundant


188
0:14:31,21 --> 0:14:36,36
energy. I\'92ll get America and North America
energy independent. I\'92ll do it by more


189
0:14:36,36 --> 0:14:40,46
drilling, more permits and licenses.\
We\'92re going to bring that pipeline in from


190
0:14:40,46 --> 0:14:44,87
Canada. How in the world the president said
no to that pipeline? I will never know.\


191
0:14:44,87 --> 0:14:49,7
This is about bringing good jobs back for
the middle class of America, and that\'92s


192
0:14:49,7 --> 0:14:53,29
what I\'92m going to do. CROWLEY: Mr. President,
let me just see if I can move you to the gist


193
0:14:53,29 --> 0:14:57,41
of this question, which is, are we looking
at the new normal? I can tell you that tomorrow


194
0:14:57,41 --> 0:15:0,18
morning, a lot of people in Hempstead will
wake up and fill up and they will find that


195
0:15:0,18 --> 0:15:6,35
the price of gas is over $4 a gallon.\
Is it within the purview of the government


196
0:15:6,35 --> 0:15:9,6
to bring those prices down, or are we looking
at the new normal?\


197
0:15:9,6 --> 0:15:14,89
OBAMA: Candy, there\'92s no doubt that world
demand\'92s gone up, but our production is


198
0:15:14,89 --> 0:15:19,94
going up, and we\'92re using oil more efficiently.
And very little of what Governor Romney just


199
0:15:19,94 --> 0:15:26,2
said is true. We\'92ve opened up public lands.
We\'92re actually drilling more on public


200
0:15:26,2 --> 0:15:31,149
lands than in the previous administration
and my -- the previous president was an oil


201
0:15:31,149 --> 0:15:35,1
man.\
And natural gas isn\'92t just appearing magically.


202
0:15:35,1 --> 0:15:39,88
We\'92re encouraging it and working with the
industry.\


203
0:15:39,88 --> 0:15:44,55
And when I hear Governor Romney say he\'92s
a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when


204
0:15:44,55 --> 0:15:49,13
-- Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts,
you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed


205
0:15:49,13 --> 0:15:55,49
at it and said, \'93This plant kills,\'94
and took great pride in shutting it down.


206
0:15:55,49 --> 0:15:58,58
And now suddenly you\'92re a big champion
of coal.\


207
0:15:58,58 --> 0:16:3,98
So what I\'92ve tried to do is be consistent.
With respect to something like coal, we made


208
0:16:3,98 --> 0:16:9,12
the largest investment in clean coal technology,
to make sure that even as we\'92re producing


209
0:16:9,12 --> 0:16:13,94
more coal, we\'92re producing it cleaner and
smarter. Same thing with oil, same thing with


210
0:16:13,94 --> 0:16:17,67
natural gas.\
And the proof is our oil imports are down


211
0:16:17,67 --> 0:16:25,5
to the lowest levels in 20 years. Oil production
is up, natural gas production is up, and,


212
0:16:25,5 --> 0:16:29,459
most importantly, we\'92re also starting to
build cars that are more efficient.\


213
0:16:29,459 --> 0:16:32,83
And that\'92s creating jobs. That means those
cars can be exported, \'91cause that\'92s


214
0:16:32,83 --> 0:16:37,35
the demand around the world, and it also means
that it\'92ll save money in your pocketbook.\


215
0:16:37,35 --> 0:16:40,23
OBAMA: That\'92s the strategy you need, an
all-of-the-above strategy, and that\'92s what


216
0:16:40,23 --> 0:16:44,37
we\'92re going to do in the next four years.\
ROMNEY: But that\'92s not what you\'92ve done


217
0:16:44,37 --> 0:16:50,279
in the last four years. That\'92s the problem.
In the last four years, you cut permits and


218
0:16:50,279 --> 0:16:52,73
licenses on federal land and federal waters
in half.\


219
0:16:52,73 --> 0:16:54,6
OBAMA: Not true, Governor Romney.\
ROMNEY: So how much did you cut (inaudible)?\


220
0:16:54,6 --> 0:16:56,51
OBAMA: Not true.\
ROMNEY: How much did you cut them by, then?\


221
0:16:56,51 --> 0:16:58,36
OBAMA: Governor, we have actually produced
more oil --\


222
0:16:58,36 --> 0:17:1,95
ROMNEY: No, no. How much did you cut licenses
and permits on federal land and federal waters?\


223
0:17:1,95 --> 0:17:5,869
OBAMA: Governor Romney, here\'92s what we
did. There were a whole bunch of oil companies.\


224
0:17:5,869 --> 0:17:7,709
(CROSSTALK)\
ROMNEY: No, no, I had a question and the question


225
0:17:7,709 --> 0:17:9,559
was how much did you cut them by?\
OBAMA: You want me to answer a question --\


226
0:17:9,559 --> 0:17:11,999
ROMNEY: How much did you cut them by?\
OBAMA: I\'92m happy to answer the question.\


227
0:17:11,999 --> 0:17:14,919
ROMNEY: All right. And it is --\
OBAMA: Here\'92s what happened. You had a


228
0:17:14,919 --> 0:17:20,919
whole bunch of oil companies who had leases
on public lands that they weren\'92t using.


229
0:17:20,919 --> 0:17:26,679
So what we said was you can\'92t just sit
on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when


230
0:17:26,679 --> 0:17:31,499
you want to drill, when you want to produce,
when it\'92s most profitable for you. These


231
0:17:31,499 --> 0:17:38,59
are public lands. So if you want to drill
on public lands, you use it or you lose it.\


232
0:17:38,59 --> 0:17:40,2
ROMNEY: OK, (inaudible) --\
OBAMA: And so what we did was take away those


233
0:17:40,2 --> 0:17:43,85
leases. And we are now reletting them so that
we can actually make a profit.\


234
0:17:43,85 --> 0:17:45,739
ROMNEY: And production on private -- on government
land --\


235
0:17:45,739 --> 0:17:46,739
OBAMA: Production is up.\
ROMNEY: -- is down.\


236
0:17:46,739 --> 0:17:48,399
OBAMA: No, it isn\'92t.\
ROMNEY: Production on government land of oil


237
0:17:48,399 --> 0:17:49,879
is down 14 percent.\
OBAMA: Governor --\


238
0:17:49,879 --> 0:17:51,309
ROMNEY: And production on gas --\
(CROSSTALK)\


239
0:17:51,309 --> 0:17:55,369
OBAMA: It\'92s just not true.\
ROMNEY: It\'92s absolutely true. Look, there\'92s


240
0:17:55,369 --> 0:18:0,179
no question but the people recognize that
we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal


241
0:18:0,179 --> 0:18:5,299
lands and in federal waters. And coal, coal
production is not up; coal jobs are not up.\


242
0:18:5,299 --> 0:18:10,22
I was just at a coal facility, where some
1,200 people lost their jobs. The right course


243
0:18:10,22 --> 0:18:15,759
for America is to have a true all-of-the-above
policy. I don\'92t think anyone really believes


244
0:18:15,759 --> 0:18:19,619
that you\'92re a person who\'92s going to
be pushing for oil and gas and coal. You\'92ll


245
0:18:19,619 --> 0:18:21,369
get your chance in a moment. I\'92m still
speaking.\


246
0:18:21,369 --> 0:18:23,7
OBAMA: Well --\
ROMNEY: And the answer is I don\'92t believe


247
0:18:23,7 --> 0:18:24,59
people think that\'92s the case --\
OBAMA: -- (inaudible).\


248
0:18:24,59 --> 0:18:25,96
ROMNEY: That wasn\'92t the question.\
OBAMA: OK.\


249
0:18:25,96 --> 0:18:29,809
ROMNEY: That was a statement. I don\'92t think
the American people believe that. I will fight


250
0:18:29,809 --> 0:18:34,35
for oil, coal and natural gas. And the proof,
the proof of whether a strategy is working


251
0:18:34,35 --> 0:18:39,59
or not is what the price is that you\'92re
paying at the pump. If you\'92re paying less


252
0:18:39,59 --> 0:18:44,47
than you paid a year or two ago, why, then,
the strategy is working. But you\'92re paying


253
0:18:44,47 --> 0:18:47,549
more. When the president took office, the
price of gasoline here in Nassau County was


254
0:18:47,549 --> 0:18:53,259
about $1.86 a gallon. Now, it\'92s $4.00 a
gallon. The price of electricity is up.\


255
0:18:53,259 --> 0:18:56,779
If the president\'92s energy policies are
working, you\'92re going to see the cost of


256
0:18:56,779 --> 0:19:2,86
energy come down. I will fight to create more
energy in this country, to get America energy


257
0:19:2,86 --> 0:19:8,519
secure. And part of that is bringing in a
pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage


258
0:19:8,519 --> 0:19:13,269
of the oil and coal we have here, drilling
offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia


259
0:19:13,269 --> 0:19:16,48
where the people want it. Those things will
get us the energy we need.\


260
0:19:16,48 --> 0:19:20,83
CROWLEY: Mr. President, could you address,
because we did finally get to gas prices here,


261
0:19:20,83 --> 0:19:27,7
could you address what the governor said,
which is if your energy policy was working,


262
0:19:27,7 --> 0:19:30,499
the price of gasoline would not be $4 a gallon
here. Is that true?\


263
0:19:30,499 --> 0:19:32,669
OBAMA: Well, think about what the governor
-- think about what the governor just said.


264
0:19:32,669 --> 0:19:38,47
He said when I took office, the price of gasoline
was $1.80, $1.86. Why is that? Because the


265
0:19:38,47 --> 0:19:44,97
economy was on the verge of collapse, because
we were about to go through the worst recession


266
0:19:44,97 --> 0:19:50,11
since the Great Depression, as a consequence
of some of the same policies that Governor


267
0:19:50,11 --> 0:19:53,69
Romney\'92s now promoting.\
So, it\'92s conceivable that Governor Romney


268
0:19:53,69 --> 0:19:59,799
could bring down gas prices because with his
policies, we might be back in that same mess.\


269
0:19:59,799 --> 0:20:7,249
What I want to do is to create an economy
that is strong, and at the same time produce


270
0:20:7,249 --> 0:20:11,369
energy. And with respect to this pipeline
that Governor Romney keeps on talking about,


271
0:20:11,369 --> 0:20:17,289
we\'92ve -- we\'92ve built enough pipeline
to wrap around the entire earth once.\


272
0:20:17,289 --> 0:20:23,309
So, I\'92m all for pipelines. I\'92m all for
oil production. What I\'92m not for is us


273
0:20:23,309 --> 0:20:27,7
ignoring the other half of the equation. So,
for example, on wind energy, when Governor


274
0:20:27,7 --> 0:20:32,489
Romney says \'93these are imaginary jobs.\'94
When you\'92ve got thousands of people right


275
0:20:32,489 --> 0:20:39,629
now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are
working, creating wind power with good-paying


276
0:20:39,629 --> 0:20:46,169
manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator
in that -- in Iowa is all for it, providing


277
0:20:46,169 --> 0:20:52,1
tax breaks (ph) to help this work and Governor
Romney says I\'92m opposed. I\'92d get rid


278
0:20:52,1 --> 0:20:54,799
of it.\
That\'92s not an energy strategy for the future.


279
0:20:54,799 --> 0:20:57,999
And we need to win that future. And I intend
to win it as President of the United States.\


280
0:20:57,999 --> 0:20:59,45
CROWLEY: I got to -- I got to move you on
--\


281
0:20:59,45 --> 0:21:0,529
ROMNEY: He gets the first --\
CROWLEY: -- and the next question --\


282
0:21:0,529 --> 0:21:1,519
ROMNEY: He actually got --\
CROWLEY: -- for you --\


283
0:21:1,519 --> 0:21:4,34
ROMNEY: He actually got the first question.
So I get the last question -- last answer


284
0:21:4,34 --> 0:21:5,98
--\
CROWLEY: (Inaudible) in the follow up, it


285
0:21:5,98 --> 0:21:9,659
doesn\'92t quite work like that. But I\'92m
going to give you a chance here. I promise


286
0:21:9,659 --> 0:21:12,499
you, I\'92m going to.\
And the next question is for you. So if you


287
0:21:12,499 --> 0:21:16,249
want to, you know, continue on -- but I don\'92t
want to leave all --\


288
0:21:16,249 --> 0:21:17,21
ROMNEY: Candy, Candy --\
CROWLEY: -- sitting here --\


289
0:21:17,21 --> 0:21:21,45
ROMNEY: Candy, I don\'92t have a policy of
stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that -- they\'92re


290
0:21:21,45 --> 0:21:24,139
not phantom jobs. They\'92re real jobs.\
CROWLEY: OK.\


291
0:21:24,139 --> 0:21:28,619
ROMNEY: I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and
across our country. I appreciate the jobs


292
0:21:28,619 --> 0:21:32,9
in coal and oil and gas. I\'92m going to make
sure --\


293
0:21:32,9 --> 0:21:33,429
CROWLEY: OK.\
ROMNEY: -- we\'92re taking advantage of our


294
0:21:33,429 --> 0:21:38,239
energy resources. We\'92ll bring back manufacturing
to America. We\'92re going to get through


295
0:21:38,239 --> 0:21:43,22
a very aggressive energy policy, 31/2 million
more jobs in this country. It\'92s critical


296
0:21:43,22 --> 0:21:44,739
to our future.\
OBAMA: Candy, it\'92s not going to --\


297
0:21:44,739 --> 0:21:46,39
CROWLEY: We\'92re going to move you along
--\


298
0:21:46,39 --> 0:21:48,73
OBAMA: Used to being interrupted.\
CROWLEY: We\'92re going to move you both along


299
0:21:48,73 --> 0:21:52,47
to taxes over here and all these folks that
have been waiting.\


300
0:21:52,47 --> 0:21:56,809
Governor, this question is for you. It comes
from Mary Follano -- Follano, sorry.\


301
0:21:56,809 --> 0:22:1,369
ROMNEY: Hi, Mary.\
QUESTION: Governor Romney, you have stated


302
0:22:1,369 --> 0:22:6,96
that if you\'92re elected president, you would
plan to reduce the tax rates for all the tax


303
0:22:6,96 --> 0:22:12,509
brackets and that you would work with the
Congress to eliminate some deductions in order


304
0:22:12,509 --> 0:22:19,19
to make up for the loss in revenue.\
Concerning the -- these various deductions,


305
0:22:19,19 --> 0:22:26,509
the mortgage deductions, the charitable deductions,
the child tax credit and also the -- oh, what\'92s


306
0:22:26,509 --> 0:22:30,889
that other credit? I forgot.\
OBAMA: You\'92re doing great.\


307
0:22:30,889 --> 0:22:35,999
QUESTION: Oh, I remember.\
The education credits, which are important


308
0:22:35,999 --> 0:22:40,989
to me, because I have children in college.
What would be your position on those things,


309
0:22:40,989 --> 0:22:45,1
which are important to the middle class?\
ROMNEY: Thank you very much. And let me tell


310
0:22:45,1 --> 0:22:48,759
you, you\'92re absolutely right about part
of that, which is I want to bring the rates


311
0:22:48,759 --> 0:22:55,159
down, I want to simplify the tax code, and
I want to get middle- income taxpayers to


312
0:22:55,159 --> 0:22:59,169
have lower taxes.\
And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers


313
0:22:59,169 --> 0:23:4,46
to have lower taxes is because middle-income
taxpayers have been buried over the past four


314
0:23:4,46 --> 0:23:10,359
years. You\'92ve seen, as middle-income people
in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a


315
0:23:10,359 --> 0:23:16,96
family, even as gasoline prices have gone
up $2,000. Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.


316
0:23:16,96 --> 0:23:23,259
Food prices up. Utility prices up.\
The middle-income families in America have


317
0:23:23,259 --> 0:23:26,639
been crushed over the last four years. So
I want to get some relief to middle-income


318
0:23:26,639 --> 0:23:29,289
families. That\'92s part -- that\'92s part
one.\


319
0:23:29,289 --> 0:23:32,98
Now, how about deductions? \'91Cause I\'92m
going to bring rates down across the board


320
0:23:32,98 --> 0:23:37,71
for everybody, but I\'92m going to limit deductions
and exemptions and credits, particularly for


321
0:23:37,71 --> 0:23:42,7
people at the high end, because I am not going
to have people at the high end pay less than


322
0:23:42,7 --> 0:23:46,799
they\'92re paying now.\
The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue


323
0:23:46,799 --> 0:23:53,889
to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation
collects. So that\'92ll stay the same.\


324
0:23:53,889 --> 0:23:56,369
Middle-income people are going to get a tax
break.\


325
0:23:56,369 --> 0:24:0,259
And so, in terms of bringing down deductions,
one way of doing that would be say everybody


326
0:24:0,259 --> 0:24:5,69
gets -- I\'92ll pick a number -- $25,000 of
deductions and credits, and you can decide


327
0:24:5,69 --> 0:24:11,229
which ones to use. Your home mortgage interest
deduction, charity, child tax credit, and


328
0:24:11,229 --> 0:24:15,21
so forth, you can use those as part of filling
that bucket, if you will, of deductions.\


329
0:24:15,21 --> 0:24:20,32
But your rate comes down and the burden also
comes down on you for one more reason, and


330
0:24:20,32 --> 0:24:26,84
that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer
will pay any tax on interest, dividends or


331
0:24:26,84 --> 0:24:32,94
capital gains. No tax on your savings. That
makes life a lot easier.\


332
0:24:32,94 --> 0:24:37,46
If you\'92re getting interest from a bank,
if you\'92re getting a statement from a mutual


333
0:24:37,46 --> 0:24:41,889
fund or any other kind of investment you have,
you don\'92t have to worry about filing taxes


334
0:24:41,889 --> 0:24:47,8
on that, because there\'92ll be no taxes for
anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less,


335
0:24:47,8 --> 0:24:52,539
on your interest, dividends and capital gains.
Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class?


336
0:24:52,539 --> 0:24:56,45
Because under the last four years, they\'92ve
been buried. And I want to help people in


337
0:24:56,45 --> 0:25:1,9
the middle-class.\
And I will not -- I will not under any circumstances,


338
0:25:1,9 --> 0:25:4,809
reduce the share that\'92s being paid by the
highest income taxpayers. And I will not,


339
0:25:4,809 --> 0:25:10,869
under any circumstances increase taxes on
the middle-class. The president\'92s spending,


340
0:25:10,869 --> 0:25:15,779
the president\'92s borrowing will cost this
nation to have to raise taxes on the American


341
0:25:15,779 --> 0:25:20,609
people. Not just at the high end. A recent
study has shown the people in the middle-class


342
0:25:20,609 --> 0:25:25,59
will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes
as a result of the spending and borrowing


343
0:25:25,59 --> 0:25:28,509
of this administration.\
I will not let that happen. I want to get


344
0:25:28,509 --> 0:25:33,39
us on track to a balanced budget, and I\'92m
going to reduce the tax burden on middle income


345
0:25:33,39 --> 0:25:36,259
families. And what\'92s that going to do?
It\'92s going to help those families, and


346
0:25:36,259 --> 0:25:40,249
it\'92s going to create incentives to start
growing jobs again in this country.\


347
0:25:40,249 --> 0:25:46,46
CROWLEY: Thanks, Governor.\
OBAMA: My philosophy on taxes has been simple.


348
0:25:46,46 --> 0:25:52,29
And that is, I want to give middle-class families
and folks who are striving to get into the


349
0:25:52,29 --> 0:25:57,35
middle-class some relief. Because they have
been hit hard over the last decade. Over the


350
0:25:57,35 --> 0:26:1,59
last 15, over the last 20 years.\
So four years ago I stood on a stage just


351
0:26:1,59 --> 0:26:5,239
like this one. Actually it was a town hall,
and I said I would cut taxes for middle- class


352
0:26:5,239 --> 0:26:10,499
families, and that\'92s what I\'92ve done,
by $3,600.00. I said I would cut taxes for


353
0:26:10,499 --> 0:26:15,769
small businesses, who are the drivers and
engines of growth. And we\'92ve cut them 18


354
0:26:15,769 --> 0:26:24,22
times. And I want to continue those tax cuts
for middle-class families, and for small business.\


355
0:26:24,22 --> 0:26:29,96
But what I\'92ve also said is, if we\'92re
serious about reducing the deficit, if this


356
0:26:29,96 --> 0:26:35,2
is genuinely a moral obligation to the next
generation, then in addition to some tough


357
0:26:35,2 --> 0:26:41,859
spending cuts, we\'92ve also got to make sure
that the wealthy do a little bit more.\


358
0:26:41,859 --> 0:26:48,229
So what I\'92ve said is, your first $250,000.00
worth of income, no change. And that means


359
0:26:48,229 --> 0:26:54,419
98 percent of American families, 97 percent
of small businesses, they will not see a tax


360
0:26:54,419 --> 0:26:58,19
increase. I\'92m ready to sign that bill right
now. The only reason it\'92s not happening


361
0:26:58,19 --> 0:27:3,46
is because Governor Romney\'92s allies in
Congress have held the 98 percent hostage


362
0:27:3,46 --> 0:27:6,399
because they want tax breaks for the top 2
percent.\


363
0:27:6,399 --> 0:27:13,249
But what I\'92ve also says is for above $250,000,
we can go back to the tax rates we had when


364
0:27:13,249 --> 0:27:18,809
Bill Clinton was president. We created 23
million new jobs. That\'92s part of what took


365
0:27:18,809 --> 0:27:24,899
us from deficits to surplus. It will be good
for our economy and it will be good for job


366
0:27:24,899 --> 0:27:29,729
creation.\
Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.


367
0:27:29,729 --> 0:27:36,609
He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and
he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like


368
0:27:36,609 --> 0:27:41,95
you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower
tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody


369
0:27:41,95 --> 0:27:46,359
making $50,000 year? And he said, \'93Yes,
I think that\'92s fair.\'94 Not only that,


370
0:27:46,359 --> 0:27:49,32
he said, \'93I think that\'92s what grows
the economy.\'94\


371
0:27:49,32 --> 0:27:54,9
Well, I fundamentally disagree with that.
I think what grows the economy is when you


372
0:27:54,9 --> 0:28:0,8
get that tax credit that we put in place for
your kids going to college. I think that grows


373
0:28:0,8 --> 0:28:4,519
the economy. I think what grows the economy
is when we make sure small businesses are


374
0:28:4,519 --> 0:28:9,96
getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who
fought for our country. That grows our economy.\


375
0:28:9,96 --> 0:28:13,869
So we just have a different theory. And when
Governor Romney stands here, after a year


376
0:28:13,869 --> 0:28:19,349
of campaigning, when during a Republican primary
he stood on stage and said \'93I\'92m going


377
0:28:19,349 --> 0:28:24,489
to give tax cuts\'94 -- he didn\'92t say tax
rate cuts, he said \'93tax cuts to everybody,\'94


378
0:28:24,489 --> 0:28:30,389
including the top 1 percent, you should believe
him because that\'92s been his history.\


379
0:28:30,389 --> 0:28:34,669
And that\'92s exactly the kind of top-down
economics that is not going to work if we


380
0:28:34,669 --> 0:28:38,57
want a strong middle class and an economy
that\'92s striving for everybody.\


381
0:28:38,57 --> 0:28:42,799
CROWLEY: Governor Romney, I\'92m sure you\'92ve
got a reply there.\


382
0:28:42,799 --> 0:28:47,71
(LAUGHTER) ROMNEY: You\'92re absolutely right.\
You heard what I said about my tax plan. The


383
0:28:47,71 --> 0:28:52,669
top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent,
as they do today. I\'92m not looking to cut


384
0:28:52,669 --> 0:28:57,919
taxes for wealthy people. I am looking to
cut taxes for middle-income people.\


385
0:28:57,919 --> 0:29:2,659
And why do I want to bring rates down, and
at the same time lower exemptions and deductions,


386
0:29:2,659 --> 0:29:7,57
particularly for people at the high end? Because
if you bring rates down, it makes it easier


387
0:29:7,57 --> 0:29:11,769
for small business to keep more of their capital
and hire people.\


388
0:29:11,769 --> 0:29:17,259
And for me, this is about jobs. I want to
get America\'92s economy going again. Fifty-four


389
0:29:17,259 --> 0:29:23,249
percent of America\'92s workers work in businesses
that are taxed as individuals. So when you


390
0:29:23,249 --> 0:29:28,559
bring those rates down, those small businesses
are able to keep more money and hire more


391
0:29:28,559 --> 0:29:30,609
people.\
For me, I look at what\'92s happened in the


392
0:29:30,609 --> 0:29:36,33
last four years and say this has been a disappointment.
We can do better than this. We don\'92t have


393
0:29:36,33 --> 0:29:43,369
to settle for, how many months, 43 months
with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million


394
0:29:43,369 --> 0:29:45,289
Americans struggling to find a good job right
now.\


395
0:29:45,289 --> 0:29:50,21
There are 3.5 million more women living in
poverty today than when the president took


396
0:29:50,21 --> 0:29:53,369
office.\
We don\'92t have to live like this. We can


397
0:29:53,369 --> 0:29:58,19
get this economy going again. My five-point
plan does it. Energy independence for North


398
0:29:58,19 --> 0:30:2,84
America in five years. Opening up more trade,
particularly in Latin America. Cracking down


399
0:30:2,84 --> 0:30:7,649
on China when they cheat. Getting us to a
balanced budget. Fixing our training programs


400
0:30:7,649 --> 0:30:11,399
for our workers. And finally, championing
small business.\


401
0:30:11,399 --> 0:30:16,769
I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.
I know how to make that happen. I spent my


402
0:30:16,769 --> 0:30:21,109
life in the private sector. I know why jobs
come and why they go. And they\'92re going


403
0:30:21,109 --> 0:30:25,679
now because of the policies of this administration.\
CROWLEY: Governor, let me ask the president


404
0:30:25,679 --> 0:30:31,46
something about what you just said.\
The governor says that he is not going to


405
0:30:31,46 --> 0:30:37,2
allow the top 5 percent, believe is what he
said, to have a tax cut, that it will all


406
0:30:37,2 --> 0:30:42,499
even out, that what he wants to do is give
that tax cut to the middle class. Settled?\


407
0:30:42,499 --> 0:30:51,359
OBAMA: No, it\'92s not settled.\
Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody


408
0:30:51,359 --> 0:30:56,889
across the board, 20 percent. Along with what
he also wants to do in terms of eliminating


409
0:30:56,889 --> 0:31:2,21
the estate tax, along what he wants to do
in terms of corporates, changes in the tax


410
0:31:2,21 --> 0:31:8,179
code, it costs about $5 trillion.\
Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2


411
0:31:8,179 --> 0:31:13,249
trillion on additional military programs even
though the military\'92s not asking for them.


412
0:31:13,249 --> 0:31:17,289
That\'92s $7 trillion.\
He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts


413
0:31:17,289 --> 0:31:22,84
for the wealthiest Americans. That\'92s another
trillion dollars -- that\'92s $8 trillion.\


414
0:31:22,84 --> 0:31:29,96
Now, what he says is he\'92s going to make
sure that this doesn\'92t add to the deficit


415
0:31:29,96 --> 0:31:34,899
and he\'92s going to cut middleclass taxes.\
But when he\'92s asked, how are you going


416
0:31:34,899 --> 0:31:40,159
to do it, which deductions, which loopholes
are you going to close? He can\'92t tell you.\


417
0:31:40,159 --> 0:31:46,679
The -- the fact that he only has to pay 14
percent on his taxes when a lot of you are


418
0:31:46,679 --> 0:31:51,779
paying much higher. He\'92s already taken
that off the board, capital gains are going


419
0:31:51,779 --> 0:31:56,83
to continue to be at a low rate so we -- we\'92re
not going to get money that way.\


420
0:31:56,83 --> 0:32:3,289
We haven\'92t heard from the governor any
specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating


421
0:32:3,289 --> 0:32:6,169
funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of
how he pays for that.\


422
0:32:6,169 --> 0:32:13,429
Now, Governor Romney was a very successful
investor. If somebody came to you, Governor,


423
0:32:13,429 --> 0:32:19,34
with a plan that said, here, I want to spend
$7 or $8 trillion, and then we\'92re going


424
0:32:19,34 --> 0:32:24,389
to pay for it, but we can\'92t tell you until
maybe after the election how we\'92re going


425
0:32:24,389 --> 0:32:30,779
to do it, you wouldn\'92t take such a sketchy
deal and neither should you, the American


426
0:32:30,779 --> 0:32:36,739
people, because the math doesn\'92t add up.\
And -- and what\'92s at stake here is one


427
0:32:36,739 --> 0:32:42,919
of two things, either Candy -- this blows
up the deficit because keep in mind, this


428
0:32:42,919 --> 0:32:48,179
is just to pay for the additional spending
that he\'92s talking about, $7 trillion - $8


429
0:32:48,179 --> 0:32:53,44
trillion before we even get to the deficit
we already have. Or, alternatively, it\'92s


430
0:32:53,44 --> 0:32:58,369
got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions
for wealthy individuals, that -- that will


431
0:32:58,369 --> 0:33:3,479
pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates.\
You\'92re going to be paying for it. You\'92re


432
0:33:3,479 --> 0:33:8,679
going to lose some deductions, and you can\'92t
buy the sales pitch. Nobody who\'92s looked


433
0:33:8,679 --> 0:33:11,69
at it that\'92s serious, actually believes
it adds up.\


434
0:33:11,69 --> 0:33:15,159
CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me get -- let
me get the governor in on this. And Governor,


435
0:33:15,159 --> 0:33:17,669
let\'92s -- before we get into a...\
ROMNEY: I -- I...\


436
0:33:17,669 --> 0:33:23,729
CROWLEY: ...vast array of who says -- what
study says what, if it shouldn\'92t add up.


437
0:33:23,729 --> 0:33:28,399
If somehow when you get in there, there isn\'92t
enough tax revenue coming in. If somehow the


438
0:33:28,399 --> 0:33:33,559
numbers don\'92t add up, would you be willing
to look again at a 20 percent...\


439
0:33:33,559 --> 0:33:40,299
ROMNEY: Well of course they add up. I -- I
was -- I was someone who ran businesses for


440
0:33:40,299 --> 0:33:46,36
25 years, and balanced the budget. I ran the
Olympics and balanced the budget. I ran the


441
0:33:46,36 --> 0:33:51,19
-- the state of Massachusetts as a governor,
to the extent any governor does, and balanced


442
0:33:51,19 --> 0:33:56,39
the budget all four years. When we\'92re talking
about math that doesn\'92t add up, how about


443
0:33:56,39 --> 0:34:1,32
$4 trillion of deficits over the last four
years, $5 trillion? That\'92s math that doesn\'92t


444
0:34:1,32 --> 0:34:7,889
add up. We have -- we have a president talking
about someone\'92s plan in a way that\'92s


445
0:34:7,889 --> 0:34:13,23
completely foreign to what my real plan is.\
ROMNEY: And then we have his own record, which


446
0:34:13,23 --> 0:34:18,49
is we have four consecutive years where he
said when he was running for office, he would


447
0:34:18,49 --> 0:34:23,859
cut the deficit in half. Instead he\'92s doubled
it. We\'92ve gone from $10 trillion of national


448
0:34:23,859 --> 0:34:29,639
debt, to $16 trillion of national debt. If
the president were reelected, we\'92d go to


449
0:34:29,639 --> 0:34:35,21
almost $20 trillion of national debt. This
puts us on a road to Greece. I know what it


450
0:34:35,21 --> 0:34:39,48
takes to balance budgets. I\'92ve done it
my entire life. So for instance when he says,


451
0:34:39,48 --> 0:34:44,319
\'93Yours is a $5 trillion cut.\'94 Well,
no it\'92s not. Because I\'92m offsetting


452
0:34:44,319 --> 0:34:47,669
some of the reductions with holding down some
of the deductions.\


453
0:34:47,669 --> 0:34:49,34
And...\
CROWLEY: Governor, I\'92ve gotta -- gotta


454
0:34:49,34 --> 0:34:50,77
-- actually, I need to have you both (inaudible).\
(CROSSTALK)\


455
0:34:50,77 --> 0:34:55,619
CROWLEY: I understand the stakes here. I understand
both of you. But I -- I will get run out of


456
0:34:55,619 --> 0:34:56,59
town if I don\'92t...\
(CROSSTALK)\


457
0:34:56,59 --> 0:34:58,599
ROMNEY: And I just described -- I just described
to you, Mr. President -- I just described


458
0:34:58,599 --> 0:35:2,99
to you precisely how I\'92d do it which is
with a single number that people can put -- and


459
0:35:2,99 --> 0:35:5,48
they can put they\'92re -- they\'92re deductions
and credits...\


460
0:35:5,48 --> 0:35:7,589
(CROSSTALK)\
CROWLEY: Mr. President, we\'92re keeping track,


461
0:35:7,589 --> 0:35:11,66
I promise you. And Mr. President, the next
question is for you, so stay standing.\


462
0:35:11,66 --> 0:35:14,819
OBAMA: Great. Looking forward to it.\
And it\'92s Katherine Fenton, who has a question


463
0:35:14,819 --> 0:35:21,789
for you.\
QUESTION: In what new ways to you intend to


464
0:35:21,789 --> 0:35:26,809
rectify the inequalities in the workplace,
specifically regarding females making only


465
0:35:26,809 --> 0:35:29,299
72 percent of what their male counterparts
earn?\


466
0:35:29,299 --> 0:35:34,68
OBAMA: Well, Katherine, that\'92s a great
question. And, you know, I was raised by a


467
0:35:34,68 --> 0:35:43,24
single mom who had to put herself through
school while looking after two kids. And she


468
0:35:43,24 --> 0:35:48,19
worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices
to make sure we got everything we needed.


469
0:35:48,19 --> 0:35:56,22
My grandmother, she started off as a secretary
in a bank. She never got a college education,


470
0:35:56,22 --> 0:36:0,539
even though she was smart as a whip. And she
worked her way up to become a vice president


471
0:36:0,539 --> 0:36:8,539
of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling.
She trained people who would end up becoming


472
0:36:8,539 --> 0:36:12,18
her bosses during the course of her career.\
She didn\'92t complain. That\'92s not what


473
0:36:12,18 --> 0:36:19,16
you did in that generation. And this is one
of the reasons why one of the first -- the


474
0:36:19,16 --> 0:36:25,64
first bill I signed was something called the
Lily Ledbetter bill. And it\'92s named after


475
0:36:25,64 --> 0:36:32,97
this amazing woman who had been doing the
same job as a man for years, found out that


476
0:36:32,97 --> 0:36:37,91
she was getting paid less, and the Supreme
Court said that she couldn\'92t bring suit


477
0:36:37,91 --> 0:36:41,39
because she should have found about it earlier,
whereas she had no way of finding out about


478
0:36:41,39 --> 0:36:48,349
it. So we fixed that. And that\'92s an example
of the kind of advocacy that we need, because


479
0:36:48,349 --> 0:36:56,29
women are increasingly the breadwinners in
the family. This is not just a women\'92s


480
0:36:56,29 --> 0:37:0,359
issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class
issue, and that\'92s why we\'92ve got to fight


481
0:37:0,359 --> 0:37:4,349
for it.\
It also means that we\'92ve got to make sure


482
0:37:4,349 --> 0:37:8,93
that young people like yourself are able to
afford a college education. Earlier, Governor


483
0:37:8,93 --> 0:37:14,97
Romney talked about he wants to make Pell
Grants and other education accessible for


484
0:37:14,97 --> 0:37:17,21
young people.\
Well, the truth of the matter is, is that


485
0:37:17,21 --> 0:37:21,39
that\'92s exactly what we\'92ve done. We\'92ve
expanded Pell Grants for millions of people,


486
0:37:21,39 --> 0:37:23,72
including millions of young women, all across
the country.\


487
0:37:23,72 --> 0:37:30,66
We did it by taking $60 billion that was going
to banks and lenders as middlemen for the


488
0:37:30,66 --> 0:37:34,7
student loan program, and we said, let\'92s
just cut out the middleman. Let\'92s give


489
0:37:34,7 --> 0:37:38,15
the money directly to students.\
And as a consequence, we\'92ve seen millions


490
0:37:38,15 --> 0:37:42,349
of young people be able to afford college,
and that\'92s going to make sure that young


491
0:37:42,349 --> 0:37:44,76
women are going to be able to compete in that
marketplace.\


492
0:37:44,76 --> 0:37:49,19
But we\'92ve got to enforce the laws, which
is what we are doing, and we\'92ve also got


493
0:37:49,19 --> 0:37:54,75
to make sure that in every walk of life we
do not tolerate discrimination.\


494
0:37:54,75 --> 0:37:59,42
That\'92s been one of the hallmarks of my
administration. I\'92m going to continue to


495
0:37:59,42 --> 0:38:4,319
push on this issue for the next four years.\
CROWLEY: Governor Romney, pay equity for women?\


496
0:38:4,319 --> 0:38:10,13
ROMNEY: Thank you. And important topic, and
one which I learned a great deal about, particularly


497
0:38:10,13 --> 0:38:15,15
as I was serving as governor of my state,
because I had the chance to pull together


498
0:38:15,15 --> 0:38:20,22
a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to
be men.\


499
0:38:20,22 --> 0:38:23,29
And I -- and I went to my staff, and I said,
\'93How come all the people for these jobs


500
0:38:23,29 --> 0:38:25,99
are -- are all men.\'94 They said, \'93Well,
these are the people that have the qualifications.\'94


501
0:38:25,99 --> 0:38:30,539
And I said, \'93Well, gosh, can\'92t we -- can\'92t
we find some -- some women that are also qualified?\'94\


502
0:38:30,539 --> 0:38:36,43
ROMNEY: And -- and so we -- we took a concerted
effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds


503
0:38:36,43 --> 0:38:39,329
that could be qualified to become members
of our cabinet.\


504
0:38:39,329 --> 0:38:42,99
I went to a number of women\'92s groups and
said, \'93Can you help us find folks,\'94


505
0:38:42,99 --> 0:38:45,14
and they brought us whole binders full of
women.\


506
0:38:45,14 --> 0:38:50,75
I was proud of the fact that after I staffed
my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University


507
0:38:50,75 --> 0:38:56,16
of New York in Albany did a survey of all
50 states, and concluded that mine had more


508
0:38:56,16 --> 0:39:0,109
women in senior leadership positions than
any other state in America.\


509
0:39:0,109 --> 0:39:3,539
Now one of the reasons I was able to get so
many good women to be part of that team was


510
0:39:3,539 --> 0:39:7,549
because of our recruiting effort. But number
two, because I recognized that if you\'92re


511
0:39:7,549 --> 0:39:11,25
going to have women in the workforce that
sometimes you need to be more flexible. My


512
0:39:11,25 --> 0:39:14,619
chief of staff, for instance, had two kids
that were still in school.\


513
0:39:14,619 --> 0:39:18,99
She said, I can\'92t be here until 7 or 8
o\'92clock at night. I need to be able to


514
0:39:18,99 --> 0:39:23,17
get home at 5 o\'92clock so I can be there
for making dinner for my kids and being with


515
0:39:23,17 --> 0:39:27,29
them when they get home from school. So we
said fine. Let\'92s have a flexible schedule


516
0:39:27,29 --> 0:39:31,69
so you can have hours that work for you.\
We\'92re going to have to have employers in


517
0:39:31,69 --> 0:39:36,27
the new economy, in the economy I\'92m going
to bring to play, that are going to be so


518
0:39:36,27 --> 0:39:39,819
anxious to get good workers they\'92re going
to be anxious to hire women. In the -- in


519
0:39:39,819 --> 0:39:46,65
the last women have lost 580,000 jobs. That\'92s
the net of what\'92s happened in the last


520
0:39:46,65 --> 0:39:53,289
four years. We\'92re still down 580,000 jobs.
I mentioned 31/2 million women, more now in


521
0:39:53,289 --> 0:39:58,99
poverty than four years ago.\
What we can do to help young women and women


522
0:39:58,99 --> 0:40:3,2
of all ages is to have a strong economy, so
strong that employers that are looking to


523
0:40:3,2 --> 0:40:9,21
find good employees and bringing them into
their workforce and adapting to a flexible


524
0:40:9,21 --> 0:40:14,92
work schedule that gives women opportunities
that they would otherwise not be able to afford.\


525
0:40:14,92 --> 0:40:19,65
This is what I have done. It\'92s what I look
forward to doing and I know what it takes


526
0:40:19,65 --> 0:40:24,73
to make an economy work, and I know what a
working economy looks like. And an economy


527
0:40:24,73 --> 0:40:31,92
with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real
strong economy. An economy that has 23 million


528
0:40:31,92 --> 0:40:37,869
people looking for work is not a strong economy.\
An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating


529
0:40:37,869 --> 0:40:42,569
from college that can\'92t finds a job, or
a college level job, that\'92s not what we


530
0:40:42,569 --> 0:40:45,44
have to have. CROWLEY: Governor?\
ROMNEY: I\'92m going to help women in America


531
0:40:45,44 --> 0:40:49,839
get good work by getting a stronger economy
and by supporting women in the workforce.\


532
0:40:49,839 --> 0:40:51,97
CROWLEY: Mr. President why don\'92t you get
in on this quickly, please?\


533
0:40:51,97 --> 0:40:55,269
OBAMA: Katherine, I just want to point out
that when Governor Romney\'92s campaign was


534
0:40:55,269 --> 0:41:0,48
asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether
he supported it? He said, \'93I\'92ll get


535
0:41:0,48 --> 0:41:5,64
back to you.\'94 And that\'92s not the kind
of advocacy that women need in any economy.


536
0:41:5,64 --> 0:41:12,819
Now, there are some other issues that have
a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace.


537
0:41:12,819 --> 0:41:20,599
For example, their healthcare. You know a
major difference in this campaign is that


538
0:41:20,599 --> 0:41:27,0
Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians
in Washington decide the health care choices


539
0:41:27,0 --> 0:41:31,549
that women are making.\
I think that\'92s a mistake. In my health


540
0:41:31,549 --> 0:41:38,339
care bill, I said insurance companies need
to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody


541
0:41:38,339 --> 0:41:43,45
who is insured. Because this is not just a
-- a health issue, it\'92s an economic issue


542
0:41:43,45 --> 0:41:50,0
for women. It makes a difference. This is
money out of that family\'92s pocket. Governor


543
0:41:50,0 --> 0:41:55,21
Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that
in fact employers should be able to make the


544
0:41:55,21 --> 0:42:1,63
decision as to whether or not a woman gets
contraception through her insurance coverage.\


545
0:42:1,63 --> 0:42:8,64
That\'92s not the kind of advocacy that women
need. When Governor Romney says that we should


546
0:42:8,64 --> 0:42:14,59
eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood,
there are millions of women all across the


547
0:42:14,59 --> 0:42:18,26
country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for,
not just contraceptive care, they rely on


548
0:42:18,26 --> 0:42:25,43
it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.
That\'92s a pocketbook issue for women and


549
0:42:25,43 --> 0:42:30,44
families all across the country. And it makes
a difference in terms of how well and effectively


550
0:42:30,44 --> 0:42:37,22
women are able to work. When we talk about
child care, and the credits that we\'92re


551
0:42:37,22 --> 0:42:41,24
providing. That makes a difference in whether
they can go out there and -- and earn a living


552
0:42:41,24 --> 0:42:46,299
for their family.\
These are not just women\'92s issues. These


553
0:42:46,299 --> 0:42:52,42
are family issues. These are economic issues.\
And one of the things that makes us grow as


554
0:42:52,42 --> 0:42:58,13
an economy is when everybody participates
and women are getting the same fair deal as


555
0:42:58,13 --> 0:42:58,93
men are.\
CROWLEY: Mr. President...\


556
0:42:58,93 --> 0:43:2,319
OBAMA: And I\'92ve got two daughters and I
want to make sure that they have the same


557
0:43:2,319 --> 0:43:8,0
opportunities that anybody\'92s sons have.
That\'92s part of what I\'92m fighting for


558
0:43:8,0 --> 0:43:10,839
as president of the United States.\
CROWLEY: I want to move us along here to Susan


559
0:43:10,839 --> 0:43:18,51
Katz, who has a question.\
And, Governor, it\'92s for you. QUESTION:


560
0:43:18,51 --> 0:43:23,51
Governor Romney, I am an undecided voter,
because I\'92m disappointed with the lack


561
0:43:23,51 --> 0:43:30,92
of progress I\'92ve seen in the last four
years. However, I do attribute much of America\'92s


562
0:43:30,92 --> 0:43:37,89
economic and international problems to the
failings and missteps of the Bush administration.\


563
0:43:37,89 --> 0:43:45,92
Since both you and President Bush are Republicans,
I fear a return to the policies of those years


564
0:43:45,92 --> 0:43:51,43
should you win this election. What is the
biggest difference between you and George


565
0:43:51,43 --> 0:43:57,619
W. Bush, and how do you differentiate yourself
from George W. Bush?\


566
0:43:57,619 --> 0:44:2,72
ROMNEY: Thank you. And I appreciate that question.\
I just want to make sure that, I think I was


567
0:44:2,72 --> 0:44:6,279
supposed to get that last answer, but I want
to point out that that I don\'92t believe...\


568
0:44:6,279 --> 0:44:7,779
OBAMA: I don\'92t think so, Candy.\
ROMNEY: ... I don\'92t believe...\


569
0:44:7,779 --> 0:44:10,519
OBAMA: I want to make sure our timekeepers
are working here.\


570
0:44:10,519 --> 0:44:12,88
ROMNEY: The time -- the time...\
CROWLEY: OK. The timekeepers are all working.


571
0:44:12,88 --> 0:44:17,97
And let me tell you that the last part, it\'92s
for the two of you to talk to one another,


572
0:44:17,97 --> 0:44:21,289
and it isn\'92t quite as (inaudible) you think.\
But go ahead and use this two minutes any


573
0:44:21,289 --> 0:44:23,72
way you\'92d like to, the question is on the
floor.\


574
0:44:23,72 --> 0:44:27,579
ROMNEY: I\'92d just note that I don\'92t believe
that bureaucrats in Washington should tell


575
0:44:27,579 --> 0:44:31,43
someone whether they can use contraceptives
or not. And I don\'92t believe employers should


576
0:44:31,43 --> 0:44:35,349
tell someone whether they could have contraceptive
care of not. Every woman in America should


577
0:44:35,349 --> 0:44:39,39
have access to contraceptives. And -- and
the -- and the president\'92s statement of


578
0:44:39,39 --> 0:44:41,839
my policy is completely and totally wrong.\
OBAMA: Governor...\


579
0:44:41,839 --> 0:44:45,43
ROMNEY: Let me come back and -- and answer
your question.\


580
0:44:45,43 --> 0:44:49,39
President Bush and I are -- are different
people and these are different times and that\'92s


581
0:44:49,39 --> 0:44:52,23
why my five point plan is so different than
what he would have done.\


582
0:44:52,23 --> 0:44:57,73
I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue
of new technology actually get all the energy


583
0:44:57,73 --> 0:45:2,45
we need in North America without having to
go to the -- the Arabs or the Venezuelans


584
0:45:2,45 --> 0:45:6,99
or anyone else. That wasn\'92t true in his
time, that\'92s why my policy starts with


585
0:45:6,99 --> 0:45:11,369
a very robust policy to get all that energy
in North America -- become energy secure.\


586
0:45:11,369 --> 0:45:16,529
Number two, trade -- I\'92ll crack down on
China, President Bush didn\'92t. I\'92m also


587
0:45:16,529 --> 0:45:20,559
going to dramatically expand trade in Latin
America. It\'92s been growing about 12 percent


588
0:45:20,559 --> 0:45:24,48
per year over a long period of time. I want
to add more free trade agreements so we\'92ll


589
0:45:24,48 --> 0:45:27,339
have more trade.\
Number three, I\'92m going to get us to a


590
0:45:27,339 --> 0:45:32,559
balanced budget. President Bush didn\'92t.
President Obama was right, he said that that


591
0:45:32,559 --> 0:45:37,319
was outrageous to have deficits as high as
half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.


592
0:45:37,319 --> 0:45:42,71
He was right, but then he put in place deficits
twice that size for every one of his four


593
0:45:42,71 --> 0:45:48,65
years. And his forecast for the next four
years is more deficits, almost that large.


594
0:45:48,65 --> 0:45:50,94
So that\'92s the next area I\'92m different
than President Bush.\


595
0:45:50,94 --> 0:45:55,69
And then let\'92s take the last one, championing
small business. Our party has been focused


596
0:45:55,69 --> 0:46:1,64
too long. I came through small business. I
understand how hard it is to start a small


597
0:46:1,64 --> 0:46:6,91
business. That\'92s why everything I\'92ll
do is designed to help small businesses grow


598
0:46:6,91 --> 0:46:12,96
and add jobs. I want to keep their taxes down
on small business. I want regulators to see


599
0:46:12,96 --> 0:46:17,529
their job as encouraging small enterprise,
not crushing it.\


600
0:46:17,529 --> 0:46:21,13
And the thing I find the most troubling about
Obama Care, well it\'92s a long list, but


601
0:46:21,13 --> 0:46:25,97
one of the things I find most troubling is
that when you go out and talk to small businesses


602
0:46:25,97 --> 0:46:30,43
and ask them what they think about it, they
tell you it keeps them from hiring more people.\


603
0:46:30,43 --> 0:46:35,829
My priority is jobs. I know how to make that
happen. And President Bush has a very different


604
0:46:35,829 --> 0:46:41,819
path for a very different time. My path is
designed in getting small businesses to grow


605
0:46:41,819 --> 0:46:45,64
and hire people.\
CROWLEY: Thanks, Governor.\


606
0:46:45,64 --> 0:46:49,68
Mr. President?\
OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think it\'92s


607
0:46:49,68 --> 0:46:55,5
important to tell you that we did come in
during some tough times. We were losing 800,000


608
0:46:55,5 --> 0:47:2,68
jobs a month when I started. But we had been
digging our way out of policies that were


609
0:47:2,68 --> 0:47:9,69
misplaced and focused on the top doing very
well and middle class folks not doing well.\


610
0:47:9,69 --> 0:47:15,95
Now, we\'92ve seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive
months of job growth; 5.2 million new jobs


611
0:47:15,95 --> 0:47:22,539
created. And the plans that I talked about
will create even more. But when Governor Romney


612
0:47:22,539 --> 0:47:27,519
says that he has a very different economic
plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan


613
0:47:27,519 --> 0:47:34,819
are tax cuts. That\'92s what took us from
surplus to deficit. When he talks about getting


614
0:47:34,819 --> 0:47:42,9
tough on China, keep in mind that Governor
Romney invested in companies that were pioneers


615
0:47:42,9 --> 0:47:50,339
of outsourcing to China, and is currently
investing in countries -- in companies that


616
0:47:50,339 --> 0:47:55,89
are building surveillance equipment for China
to spy on its own folks.\


617
0:47:55,89 --> 0:47:58,789
That\'92s -- Governor, you\'92re the last
person who\'92s going to get tough on China.


618
0:47:58,789 --> 0:48:4,17
And what we\'92ve done when it comes to trade
is not only sign three trade deals to open


619
0:48:4,17 --> 0:48:10,45
up new markets, but we\'92ve also set up a
task force for trade that goes after anybody


620
0:48:10,45 --> 0:48:13,809
who is taking advantage of American workers
or businesses and not creating a level playing


621
0:48:13,809 --> 0:48:20,369
field. We\'92ve brought twice as many cases
against unfair trading practices than the


622
0:48:20,369 --> 0:48:24,319
previous administration and we\'92ve won every
single one that\'92s been decided.\


623
0:48:24,319 --> 0:48:30,13
When I said that we had to make sure that
China was not flooding our domestic market


624
0:48:30,13 --> 0:48:35,309
with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was
being protectionist; that it wouldn\'92t be


625
0:48:35,309 --> 0:48:39,88
helpful to American workers. Well, in fact
we saved 1,000 jobs. And that\'92s the kind


626
0:48:39,88 --> 0:48:46,17
of tough trade actions that are required.\
But the last point I want to make is this.


627
0:48:46,17 --> 0:48:50,119
You know, there are some things where Governor
Romney is different from George Bush. George


628
0:48:50,119 --> 0:48:58,89
Bush didn\'92t propose turning Medicare into
a voucher. George Bush embraced comprehensive


629
0:48:58,89 --> 0:49:1,319
immigration reform. He didn\'92t call for
self-deportation.\


630
0:49:1,319 --> 0:49:10,0
George Bush never suggested that we eliminate
funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are


631
0:49:10,0 --> 0:49:16,289
differences between Governor Romney and George
Bush, but they\'92re not on economic policy.


632
0:49:16,289 --> 0:49:20,74
In some ways, he\'92s gone to a more extreme
place when it comes to social policy. And


633
0:49:20,74 --> 0:49:24,289
I think that\'92s a mistake. That\'92s not
how we\'92re going to move our economy forward.\


634
0:49:24,289 --> 0:49:27,66
CROWLEY: I want to move you both along to
the next question, because it\'92s in the


635
0:49:27,66 --> 0:49:32,91
same wheelhouse, so you will be able to respond.
But the president does get this question.


636
0:49:32,91 --> 0:49:42,119
I want to call on Michael Jones.\
QUESTION: Mr. President, I voted for you in


637
0:49:42,119 --> 0:49:47,98
2008. What have you done or accomplished to
earn my vote in 2012? I\'92m not that optimistic


638
0:49:47,98 --> 0:49:54,41
as I was in 2012. Most things I need for everyday
living are very expensive.\


639
0:49:54,41 --> 0:49:59,91
OBAMA: Well, we\'92ve gone through a tough
four years. There\'92s no doubt about it.


640
0:49:59,91 --> 0:50:4,849
But four years ago, I told the American people
and I told you I would cut taxes for middle


641
0:50:4,849 --> 0:50:10,89
class families. And I did. I told you I\'92d
cut taxes for small businesses, and I have.\


642
0:50:10,89 --> 0:50:15,95
I said that I\'92d end the war in Iraq, and
I did. I said we\'92d refocus attention on


643
0:50:15,95 --> 0:50:21,309
those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and
we have gone after Al Qaeda\'92s leadership


644
0:50:21,309 --> 0:50:27,48
like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead.\
OBAMA: I said that we would put in place health


645
0:50:27,48 --> 0:50:31,48
care reform to make sure that insurance companies
can\'92t jerk you around and if you don\'92t


646
0:50:31,48 --> 0:50:34,589
have health insurance, that you\'92d have
a chance to get affordable insurance, and


647
0:50:34,589 --> 0:50:38,79
I have.\
I committed that I would rein in the excesses


648
0:50:38,79 --> 0:50:45,79
of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest
Wall Street reforms since the 1930s. We\'92ve


649
0:50:45,79 --> 0:50:50,95
created five million jobs, and gone from 800
jobs a month being lost, and we are making


650
0:50:50,95 --> 0:50:54,64
progress. We saved an auto industry that was
on the brink of collapse.\


651
0:50:54,64 --> 0:51:1,39
Now, does that mean you\'92re not struggling?
Absolutely not. A lot of us are. And that\'92s


652
0:51:1,39 --> 0:51:6,69
why the plan that I\'92ve put forward for
manufacturing and education, and reducing


653
0:51:6,69 --> 0:51:12,93
our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings
from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting


654
0:51:12,93 --> 0:51:19,48
people back to work. Making sure that we are
controlling our own energy, but not only the


655
0:51:19,48 --> 0:51:22,73
energy of today, but also the energy of the
future. All of those things will make a difference,


656
0:51:22,73 --> 0:51:28,14
so the point is the commitments I\'92ve made,
I\'92ve kept.\


657
0:51:28,14 --> 0:51:31,63
And those that I haven\'92t been able to keep,
it\'92s not for lack of trying and we\'92re


658
0:51:31,63 --> 0:51:36,779
going to get it done in a second term. But,
you should pay attention to this campaign,


659
0:51:36,779 --> 0:51:41,38
because Governor Romney has made some commitments
as well. And I suspect he\'92ll keep those


660
0:51:41,38 --> 0:51:46,4
too. You know when members of the Republican
Congress say, \'93We\'92re going to sign a


661
0:51:46,4 --> 0:51:52,839
no tax pledge, so that we don\'92t ask a dime
for millionaires and billionaires to reduce


662
0:51:52,839 --> 0:52:0,38
our deficit so we can still invest in education,
and helping kids go to college. He said, \'93Me


663
0:52:0,38 --> 0:52:3,9
too.\'94\
When they said, \'93We\'92re going to cut


664
0:52:3,9 --> 0:52:7,9
Planned Parenthood funding.\'94 He said, \'93Me
too.\'94 When he said, \'93We\'92re going


665
0:52:7,9 --> 0:52:11,49
to repeal Obamacare. First thing I\'92m going
to do,\'94 despite the fact that it\'92s the


666
0:52:11,49 --> 0:52:18,529
same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts
and is working well. He said, \'93Me too.\'94


667
0:52:18,529 --> 0:52:22,19
That is not the kind of leadership that you
need, but you should expect that those are


668
0:52:22,19 --> 0:52:24,9
promises he\'92s going to keep.\
(CROSSTALK)\


669
0:52:24,9 --> 0:52:25,29
CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me let...\
(CROSSTALK)\


670
0:52:25,29 --> 0:52:27,809
OBAMA: ...the choice in this election is going
to be whose promises are going to be more


671
0:52:27,809 --> 0:52:33,89
likely to help you in your life? Make sure
your kids can go to college. Make sure that


672
0:52:33,89 --> 0:52:36,89
you are getting a good paying job, making
sure that Medicare and Social Security...


673
0:52:36,89 --> 0:52:36,289
(CROSSTALK)\
CROWLEY: Mr. President. Thank you.\


674
0:52:36,289 --> 0:52:37,72
(CROSSTALK)\
OBAMA: ...will be there for you.\


675
0:52:37,72 --> 0:52:44,88
CROWLEY: Thank you. Governor?\
ROMNEY: I think you know better. I think you


676
0:52:44,88 --> 0:52:48,769
know that these last four years haven\'92t
been so good as the president just described


677
0:52:48,769 --> 0:52:51,89
and that you don\'92t feel like your confident
that the next four years are going to be much


678
0:52:51,89 --> 0:52:55,4
better either.\
I can tell you that if you were to elect President


679
0:52:55,4 --> 0:52:58,46
Obama, you know what you\'92re going to get.
You\'92re going to get a repeat of the last


680
0:52:58,46 --> 0:53:3,19
four years. We just can\'92t afford four more
years like the last four years.\


681
0:53:3,19 --> 0:53:9,109
He said that by now we\'92d have unemployment
at 5.4 percent. The difference between where


682
0:53:9,109 --> 0:53:15,9
it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans
without work.\


683
0:53:15,9 --> 0:53:19,539
I wasn\'92t the one that said 5.4 percent.
This was the president\'92s plan. Didn\'92t


684
0:53:19,539 --> 0:53:23,65
get there.\
He said he would have by now put forward a


685
0:53:23,65 --> 0:53:27,96
plan to reform Medicare and Social Security,
because he pointed out they\'92re on the road


686
0:53:27,96 --> 0:53:33,49
to bankruptcy. He would reform them. He\'92d
get that done. He hasn\'92t even made a proposal


687
0:53:33,49 --> 0:53:36,519
on either one.\
He said in his first year he\'92d put out


688
0:53:36,519 --> 0:53:41,5
an immigration plan that would deal with our
immigration challenges. Didn\'92t even file


689
0:53:41,5 --> 0:53:44,329
it.\
This is a president who has not been able


690
0:53:44,329 --> 0:53:48,88
to do what he said he\'92d do. He said that
he\'92d cut in half the deficit. He hasn\'92t


691
0:53:48,88 --> 0:53:53,92
done that either. In fact, he doubled it.
He said that by now middle-income families


692
0:53:53,92 --> 0:54:0,48
would have a reduction in their health insurance
premiums by $2,500 a year. It\'92s gone up


693
0:54:0,48 --> 0:54:6,51
by $2,500 a year. And if Obamacare is passed,
or implemented -- it\'92s already been passed


694
0:54:6,51 --> 0:54:10,5
-- if it\'92s implemented fully, it\'92ll
be another $2,500 on top.\


695
0:54:10,5 --> 0:54:15,64
ROMNEY: The middle class is getting crushed
under the policies of a president who has


696
0:54:15,64 --> 0:54:19,519
not understood what it takes to get the economy
working again. He keeps saying, \'93Look,


697
0:54:19,519 --> 0:54:24,789
I\'92ve created 5 million jobs.\'94 That\'92s
after losing 5 million jobs. The entire record


698
0:54:24,789 --> 0:54:29,799
is such that the unemployment has not been
reduced in this country. The unemployment,


699
0:54:29,799 --> 0:54:33,93
the number of people who are still looking
for work, is still 23 million Americans.\


700
0:54:33,93 --> 0:54:37,94
There are more people in poverty, one out
of six people in poverty.\


701
0:54:37,94 --> 0:54:43,24
How about food stamps? When he took office,
32 million people were on food stamps. Today,


702
0:54:43,24 --> 0:54:48,619
47 million people are on food stamps. How
about the growth of the economy? It\'92s growing


703
0:54:48,619 --> 0:54:55,41
more slowly this year than last year, and
more slowly last year than the year before.\


704
0:54:55,41 --> 0:55:0,7
The president wants to do well. I understand.
But the policies he\'92s put in place from


705
0:55:0,7 --> 0:55:6,319
Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies
to his regulatory policies, these policies


706
0:55:6,319 --> 0:55:10,819
combined have not let this economy take off
and grow like it could have.\


707
0:55:10,819 --> 0:55:14,96
You might say, \'93Well, you got an example
of one that worked better?\'94 Yeah, in the


708
0:55:14,96 --> 0:55:20,519
Reagan recession where unemployment hit 10.8
percent, between that period -- the end of


709
0:55:20,519 --> 0:55:25,72
that recession and the equivalent of time
to today, Ronald Reagan\'92s recovery created


710
0:55:25,72 --> 0:55:30,68
twice as many jobs as this president\'92s
recovery. Five million jobs doesn\'92t even


711
0:55:30,68 --> 0:55:34,769
keep up with our population growth. And the
only reason the unemployment rate seems a


712
0:55:34,769 --> 0:55:39,69
little lower today is because of all the people
that have dropped out of the workforce.\


713
0:55:39,69 --> 0:55:45,39
The president has tried, but his policies
haven\'92t worked. He\'92s great as a -- as


714
0:55:45,39 --> 0:55:50,42
a -- as a speaker and describing his plans
and his vision. That\'92s wonderful, except


715
0:55:50,42 --> 0:55:56,99
we have a record to look at. And that record
shows he just hasn\'92t been able to cut the


716
0:55:56,99 --> 0:56:1,73
deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare
and Social Security to preserve them, to get


717
0:56:1,73 --> 0:56:8,16
us the rising incomes we need. Median income
is down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans


718
0:56:8,16 --> 0:56:13,39
out of work. That\'92s what this election
is about. It\'92s about who can get the middle


719
0:56:13,39 --> 0:56:18,309
class in this country a bright and prosperous
future and assure our kids the kind of hope


720
0:56:18,309 --> 0:56:20,96
and optimism they deserve.\
CROWLEY: Governor, I want to move you along.


721
0:56:20,96 --> 0:56:24,65
Don\'92t -- don\'92t go away, and we\'92ll
have plenty of time to respond. We are quite


722
0:56:24,65 --> 0:56:28,74
aware of the clock for both of you. But I
want to bring in a different subject here.\


723
0:56:28,74 --> 0:56:32,39
Mr. President, I\'92ll be right back with
you.\


724
0:56:32,39 --> 0:56:35,4
Lorraine Osorio has a question for you about
a topic we have not...\


725
0:56:35,4 --> 0:56:37,19
OBAMA: This is for Governor Romney?\
CROWLEY: It\'92s for Governor Romney, and


726
0:56:37,19 --> 0:56:39,23
we\'92ll be right with you, Mr. President.
Thanks.\


727
0:56:39,23 --> 0:56:41,749
ROMNEY: Is it Loraina?\
QUESTION: Lorraine.\


728
0:56:41,749 --> 0:56:43,849
ROMNEY: Lorraine?\
QUESTION: Yes, Lorraine.\


729
0:56:43,849 --> 0:56:46,369
ROMNEY: Lorraine.\
QUESTION: How you doing?\


730
0:56:46,369 --> 0:56:49,96
ROMNEY: Good, thanks.\
QUESTION: Mr. Romney, what do you plan on


731
0:56:49,96 --> 0:56:54,559
doing with immigrants without their green
cards that are currently living here as productive


732
0:56:54,559 --> 0:56:58,549
members of society?\
ROMNEY: Thank you. Lorraine? Did I get that


733
0:56:58,549 --> 0:57:3,809
right? Good. Thank you for your question.
And let me step back and tell you what I would


734
0:57:3,809 --> 0:57:7,98
like to do with our immigration policy broadly
and include an answer to your question.\


735
0:57:7,98 --> 0:57:13,559
But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants.
We welcome people coming to this country as


736
0:57:13,559 --> 0:57:17,9
immigrants. My dad was born in Mexico of American
parents; Ann\'92s dad was born in Wales and


737
0:57:17,9 --> 0:57:22,47
is a first-generation American. We welcome
legal immigrants into this country.\


738
0:57:22,47 --> 0:57:27,69
I want our legal system to work better. I
want it to be streamlined. I want it to be


739
0:57:27,69 --> 0:57:31,15
clearer. I don\'92t think you have to -- shouldn\'92t
have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to


740
0:57:31,15 --> 0:57:35,859
get into this country legally. I also think
that we should give visas to people -- green


741
0:57:35,859 --> 0:57:40,22
cards, rather, to people who graduate with
skills that we need. People around the world


742
0:57:40,22 --> 0:57:45,79
with accredited degrees in science and math
get a green card stapled to their diploma,


743
0:57:45,79 --> 0:57:49,329
come to the U.S. of A. We should make sure
our legal system works.\


744
0:57:49,329 --> 0:57:54,339
Number two, we\'92re going to have to stop
illegal immigration. There are 4 million people


745
0:57:54,339 --> 0:57:58,349
who are waiting in line to get here legally.
Those who\'92ve come here illegally take their


746
0:57:58,349 --> 0:58:2,49
place. So I will not grant amnesty to those
who have come here illegally.\


747
0:58:2,49 --> 0:58:6,17
What I will do is I\'92ll put in place an
employment verification system and make sure


748
0:58:6,17 --> 0:58:10,74
that employers that hire people who have come
here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.


749
0:58:10,74 --> 0:58:15,299
I won\'92t put in place magnets for people
coming here illegally. So for instance, I


750
0:58:15,299 --> 0:58:19,74
would not give driver\'92s licenses to those
that have come here illegally as the president


751
0:58:19,74 --> 0:58:24,309
would.\
The kids of those that came here illegally,


752
0:58:24,309 --> 0:58:28,819
those kids, I think, should have a pathway
to become a permanent resident of the United


753
0:58:28,819 --> 0:58:32,69
States and military service, for instance,
is one way they would have that kind of pathway


754
0:58:32,69 --> 0:58:36,9
to become a permanent resident.\
ROMNEY: Now when the president ran for office,


755
0:58:36,9 --> 0:58:40,15
he said that he\'92d put in place, in his
first year, a piece of legislation -- he\'92d


756
0:58:40,15 --> 0:58:45,799
file a bill in his first year that would reform
our -- our immigration system, protect legal


757
0:58:45,799 --> 0:58:48,74
immigration, stop illegal immigration. He
didn\'92t do it.\


758
0:58:48,74 --> 0:58:54,289
He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate,
super majority in both Houses. Why did he


759
0:58:54,289 --> 0:59:0,319
fail to even promote legislation that would
have provided an answer for those that want


760
0:59:0,319 --> 0:59:5,539
to come legally and for those that are here
illegally today? What\'92s a question I think


761
0:59:5,539 --> 0:59:7,609
the -- the president will have a chance to
answer right now.\


762
0:59:7,609 --> 0:59:15,49
OBAMA: Good, I look forward to it.\
Was -- Lorranna -- Lorraine -- we are a nation


763
0:59:15,49 --> 0:59:22,499
of immigrants. I mean we\'92re just a few
miles away from Ellis Island. We all understand


764
0:59:22,499 --> 0:59:29,63
what this country has become because talent
from all around the world wants to come here.


765
0:59:29,63 --> 0:59:34,249
People are willing to take risks. People who
want to build on their dreams and make sure


766
0:59:34,249 --> 0:59:36,809
their kids have an even bigger dreams than
they have.\


767
0:59:36,809 --> 0:59:43,49
But we\'92re also a nation of laws. So what
I\'92ve said is we need to fix a broken immigration


768
0:59:43,49 --> 0:59:49,109
system and I\'92ve done everything that I
can on my own and sought cooperation from


769
0:59:49,109 --> 0:59:54,569
Congress to make sure that we fix the system.\
The first thing we did was to streamline the


770
0:59:54,569 --> 0:59:59,93
legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog,
make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people


771
0:59:59,93 --> 1:0:4,819
who are waiting in line, obeying the law to
make sure that they can come here and contribute


772
1:0:4,819 --> 1:0:7,38
to our country and that\'92s good for our
economic growth.\


773
1:0:7,38 --> 1:0:12,49
They\'92ll start new businesses. They\'92ll
make things happen to create jobs here in


774
1:0:12,49 --> 1:0:16,599
the United States.\
Number two, we do have to deal with our border


775
1:0:16,599 --> 1:0:22,49
so we put more border patrol on the -- any
time in history and the flow of undocumented


776
1:0:22,49 --> 1:0:26,46
works across the border is actually lower
than it\'92s been in 40 years.\


777
1:0:26,46 --> 1:0:31,9
What I\'92ve also said is if we\'92re going
to go after folks who are here illegally,


778
1:0:31,9 --> 1:0:36,999
we should do it smartly and go after folks
who are criminals, gang bangers, people who


779
1:0:36,999 --> 1:0:42,88
are hurting the community, not after students,
not after folks who are here just because


780
1:0:42,88 --> 1:0:46,309
they\'92re trying to figure out how to feed
their families. And that\'92s what we\'92ve


781
1:0:46,309 --> 1:0:52,339
done. And what I\'92ve also said is for young
people who come here, brought here often times


782
1:0:52,339 --> 1:0:59,46
by their parents. Had gone to school here,
pledged allegiance to the flag. Think of this


783
1:0:59,46 --> 1:1:4,94
as their country. Understand themselves as
Americans in every way except having papers.


784
1:1:4,94 --> 1:1:8,69
And we should make sure that we give them
a pathway to citizenship.\


785
1:1:8,69 --> 1:1:13,91
And that\'92s what I\'92ve done administratively.
Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he


786
1:1:13,91 --> 1:1:18,16
wants to help those young people too, but
during the Republican primary, he said, \'93I


787
1:1:18,16 --> 1:1:25,89
will veto the DREAM Act\'94, that would allow
these young people to have access.\'94 His


788
1:1:25,89 --> 1:1:29,22
main strategy during the Republican primary
was to say, \'93We\'92re going to encourage


789
1:1:29,22 --> 1:1:36,66
self-deportation.\'94 Making life so miserable
on folks that they\'92ll leave. He called


790
1:1:36,66 --> 1:1:41,109
the Arizona law a model for the nation. Part
of the Arizona law said that law enforcement


791
1:1:41,109 --> 1:1:45,559
officers could stop folks because they suspected
maybe they looked like they might be undocumented


792
1:1:45,559 --> 1:1:55,67
workers and check their papers.\
You know what? If my daughter or yours looks


793
1:1:55,67 --> 1:2:1,849
to somebody like they\'92re not a citizen,
I don\'92t want -- I don\'92t want to empower


794
1:2:1,849 --> 1:2:10,38
somebody like that. So, we can fix this system
in a comprehensive way. And when Governor


795
1:2:10,38 --> 1:2:16,339
Romney says, the challenge is, \'93Well Obama
didn\'92t try.\'94 That\'92s not true. I have


796
1:2:16,339 --> 1:2:20,849
sat down with Democrats and Republicans at
the beginning of my term. And I said, let\'92s


797
1:2:20,849 --> 1:2:25,619
fix this system. Including Senators previously
who had supported it on the Republican side.


798
1:2:25,619 --> 1:2:30,619
But it\'92s very hard for Republican\'92s
in Congress to support comprehensive immigration


799
1:2:30,619 --> 1:2:36,329
reform, if their standard bearer has said
that, this is not something I\'92m interested


800
1:2:36,329 --> 1:2:38,349
in supporting.\
CROWLEY: Let me get the governor in here,


801
1:2:38,349 --> 1:2:41,48
Mr. President. Let\'92s speak to, if you could...\
ROMNEY: Yes.\


802
1:2:41,48 --> 1:2:44,65
CROWLEY: ...the idea of self-deportation?\
ROMNEY: No, let -- let -- let me go back and


803
1:2:44,65 --> 1:2:49,29
speak to the points that the president made
and -- and -- and let\'92s get them correct.\


804
1:2:49,29 --> 1:2:54,239
I did not say that the Arizona law was a model
for the nation in that aspect. I said that


805
1:2:54,239 --> 1:2:59,989
the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which
is -- which is the portion of the law which


806
1:2:59,989 --> 1:3:4,119
says that employers could be able to determine
whether someone is here illegally or not illegally,


807
1:3:4,119 --> 1:3:6,17
that that was a model for the nation. That\'92s
number one.\


808
1:3:6,17 --> 1:3:10,88
Number two, I asked the president a question
I think Hispanics and immigrants all over


809
1:3:10,88 --> 1:3:15,569
the nation have asked. He was asked this on
Univision the other day. Why, when you said


810
1:3:15,569 --> 1:3:19,759
you\'92d filed legislation in your first year
didn\'92t you do it? And he didn\'92t answer.


811
1:3:19,759 --> 1:3:23,69
He -- he doesn\'92t answer that question.
He said the standard bearer wasn\'92t for


812
1:3:23,69 --> 1:3:25,349
it.\
I\'92m glad you thought I was a standard bearer


813
1:3:25,349 --> 1:3:30,539
four years ago, but I wasn\'92t.\
Four years ago you said in your first year


814
1:3:30,539 --> 1:3:35,39
you would file legislation.\
In his first year, I was just getting -- licking


815
1:3:35,39 --> 1:3:38,769
my wounds from having been beaten by John
McCain, all right. I was not the standard


816
1:3:38,769 --> 1:3:41,509
bearer.\
My -- my view is that this president should


817
1:3:41,509 --> 1:3:45,98
have honored his promise to do as he said.\
Now, let me mention one other thing, and that


818
1:3:45,98 --> 1:3:50,47
is self-deportation says let people make their
own choice. What I was saying is, we\'92re


819
1:3:50,47 --> 1:3:56,489
not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented
illegals, and take them out of the nation.


820
1:3:56,489 --> 1:4:0,65
Instead let people make their own choice.
And if they -- if they find that -- that they


821
1:4:0,65 --> 1:4:3,91
can\'92t get the benefits here that they want
and they can\'92t -- and they can\'92t find


822
1:4:3,91 --> 1:4:7,18
the job they want, then they\'92ll make a
decision to go a place where -- where they


823
1:4:7,18 --> 1:4:10,369
have better opportunities.\
But I\'92m not in favor of rounding up people


824
1:4:10,369 --> 1:4:15,29
and -- and -- and taking them out of this
country. I am in favor, as the president has


825
1:4:15,29 --> 1:4:18,41
said, and I agree with him, which is that
if people have committed crimes we got to


826
1:4:18,41 --> 1:4:20,89
get them out of this country.\
ROMNEY: Let me mention something else the


827
1:4:20,89 --> 1:4:25,59
president said. It was a moment ago and I
didn\'92t get a chance to, when he was describing


828
1:4:25,59 --> 1:4:28,299
Chinese investments and so forth.\
OBAMA: Candy?\


829
1:4:28,299 --> 1:4:31,519
Hold on a second. The...\
ROMNEY: Mr. President, I\'92m still speaking.\


830
1:4:31,519 --> 1:4:34,2
(CROSSTALK)\
ROMNEY: Mr. President, let me finish.\


831
1:4:34,2 --> 1:4:36,109
(CROSSTALK)\
ROMNEY: I\'92ve gotta continue.\


832
1:4:36,109 --> 1:4:40,43
(CROSSTALK)\
CROWLEY: Governor Romney, you can make it


833
1:4:40,43 --> 1:4:43,17
short. See all these people? They\'92ve been
waiting for you. (inaudible) make it short


834
1:4:43,17 --> 1:4:45,29
(inaudible).\
ROMNEY: Just going to make a point. Any investments


835
1:4:45,29 --> 1:4:49,359
I have over the last eight years have been
managed by a blind trust. And I understand


836
1:4:49,359 --> 1:4:54,99
they do include investments outside the United
States, including in -- in Chinese companies.\


837
1:4:54,99 --> 1:4:56,94
Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?
Have you looked at your pension?\


838
1:4:56,94 --> 1:4:59,589
OBAMA: I\'92ve got to say...\
ROMNEY: Mr. President, have you looked at


839
1:4:59,589 --> 1:5:2,99
your pension?\
OBAMA: You know, I -- I don\'92t look at my


840
1:5:2,99 --> 1:5:4,269
pension. It\'92s not as big as yours so it
doesn\'92t take as long.\


841
1:5:4,269 --> 1:5:7,18
ROMNEY: Well, let me give you some advice.\
OBAMA: I don\'92t check it that often.\


842
1:5:7,18 --> 1:5:10,289
ROMNEY: Let me give you some advice. Look
at your pension. You also have investments


843
1:5:10,289 --> 1:5:14,48
in Chinese companies. You also have investments
outside the United States. You also have investments


844
1:5:14,48 --> 1:5:16,15
through a Cayman\'92s trust.\
(CROSSTALK)\


845
1:5:16,15 --> 1:5:18,69
CROWLEY: We\'92re way off topic here, Governor
Romney.\


846
1:5:18,69 --> 1:5:21,91
(CROSSTALK)\
OBAMA: I thought we were talking about immigration.\


847
1:5:21,91 --> 1:5:25,4
(CROSSTALK)\
OBAMA: I do want to make sure that...\


848
1:5:25,4 --> 1:5:27,299
CROWLEY: If I could have you sit down, Governor
Romney. Thank you.\


849
1:5:27,299 --> 1:5:29,349
OBAMA: I do want to make sure that -- I do
want to make sure that we just understand


850
1:5:29,349 --> 1:5:34,279
something. Governor Romney says he wasn\'92t
referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.


851
1:5:34,279 --> 1:5:38,48
His top adviser on immigration is the guy
who designed the Arizona law, the entirety


852
1:5:38,48 --> 1:5:44,839
of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing. That\'92s
his policy. And it\'92s a bad policy. And


853
1:5:44,839 --> 1:5:51,43
it won\'92t help us grow.\
Look, when we think about immigration, we


854
1:5:51,43 --> 1:5:57,48
have to understand there are folks all around
the world who still see America as the land


855
1:5:57,48 --> 1:6:3,92
of promise. And they provide us energy and
they provide us innovation and they start


856
1:6:3,92 --> 1:6:7,68
companies like Intel and Google. And we want
to encourage that.\


857
1:6:7,68 --> 1:6:12,609
Now, we\'92ve got to make sure that we do
it in a smart way and a comprehensive way,


858
1:6:12,609 --> 1:6:20,71
and we make the legal system better. But when
we make this into a divisive political issue,


859
1:6:20,71 --> 1:6:24,759
and when we don\'92t have bipartisan support
-- I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch


860
1:6:24,759 --> 1:6:27,329
of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration
reform done, and we can\'92t...\


861
1:6:27,329 --> 1:6:29,42
ROMNEY: I\'92ll get it done. I\'92ll get it
done. First year...\


862
1:6:29,42 --> 1:6:33,789
OBAMA: ... we can\'92t -- we have not seen
Republicans serious about this issue at all.


863
1:6:33,789 --> 1:6:35,769
And it\'92s time for them to get serious on
it.\


864
1:6:35,769 --> 1:6:36,349
CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me move you on
here please. Mr. President, (inaudible).\


865
1:6:36,349 --> 1:6:37,44
OBAMA: This used to be a bipartisan issue.\
(CROSSTALK)\


866
1:6:37,44 --> 1:6:40,119
CROWLEY: Don\'92t go away, though -- right.
Don\'92t go away because I -- I want you to


867
1:6:40,119 --> 1:6:45,72
talk to Kerry Ladka who wants to switch the
topic for us.\


868
1:6:45,72 --> 1:6:48,29
OBAMA: OK.\
Hi, Kerry.\


869
1:6:48,29 --> 1:6:53,309
QUESTION: Good evening, Mr. President.\
OBAMA: I\'92m sorry. What\'92s your name?\


870
1:6:53,309 --> 1:6:54,319
QUESTION: It\'92s Kerry, Kerry Ladka.\
OBAMA: Great to see you.\


871
1:6:54,319 --> 1:6:59,73
QUESTION: This question actually comes from
a brain trust of my friends at Global Telecom


872
1:6:59,73 --> 1:7:1,569
Supply (ph) in Minneola yesterday.\
OBAMA: Ah.\


873
1:7:1,569 --> 1:7:5,539
QUESTION: We were sitting around, talking
about Libya, and we were reading and became


874
1:7:5,539 --> 1:7:12,14
aware of reports that the State Department
refused extra security for our embassy in


875
1:7:12,14 --> 1:7:17,88
Benghazi, Libya, prior to the attacks that
killed four Americans.\


876
1:7:17,88 --> 1:7:21,579
Who was it that denied enhanced security and
why?\


877
1:7:21,579 --> 1:7:27,589
OBAMA: Well, let me first of all talk about
our diplomats, because they serve all around


878
1:7:27,589 --> 1:7:34,259
the world and do an incredible job in a very
dangerous situation. And these aren\'92t just


879
1:7:34,259 --> 1:7:38,97
representatives of the United States, they
are my representatives. I send them there,


880
1:7:38,97 --> 1:7:44,859
oftentimes into harm\'92s way. I know these
folks and I know their families. So nobody


881
1:7:44,859 --> 1:7:48,109
is more concerned about their safety and security
than I am.\


882
1:7:48,109 --> 1:7:53,609
So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi
consulate was being overrun, I was on the


883
1:7:53,609 --> 1:7:57,299
phone with my national security team and I
gave them three instructions.\


884
1:7:57,299 --> 1:8:5,39
Number one, beef up our security and procedures,
not just in Libya, but at every embassy and


885
1:8:5,39 --> 1:8:10,619
consulate in the region.\
Number two, investigate exactly what happened,


886
1:8:10,619 --> 1:8:16,89
regardless of where the facts lead us, to
make sure folks are held accountable and it


887
1:8:16,89 --> 1:8:20,83
doesn\'92t happen again.\
And number three, we are going to find out


888
1:8:20,83 --> 1:8:24,33
who did this and we\'92re going to hunt them
down, because one of the things that I\'92ve


889
1:8:24,33 --> 1:8:30,109
said throughout my presidency is when folks
mess with Americans, we go after them.\


890
1:8:30,109 --> 1:8:36,31
OBAMA: Now Governor Romney had a very different
response. While we were still dealing with


891
1:8:36,31 --> 1:8:43,43
our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney
put out a press release, trying to make political


892
1:8:43,43 --> 1:8:51,29
points, and that\'92s not how a commander
in chief operates. You don\'92t turn national


893
1:8:51,29 --> 1:8:57,44
security into a political issue. Certainly
not right when it\'92s happening. And people


894
1:8:57,44 --> 1:9:1,71
-- not everybody agrees with some of the decisions
I\'92ve made. But when it comes to our national


895
1:9:1,71 --> 1:9:7,49
security, I mean what I say. I said I\'92d
end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and


896
1:9:7,49 --> 1:9:11,54
I did.\
I said that we\'92d go after al-Qaeda and


897
1:9:11,54 --> 1:9:17,66
bin Laden, we have. I said we\'92d transition
out of Afghanistan, and start making sure


898
1:9:17,66 --> 1:9:22,25
that Afghans are responsible for their own
security, that\'92s what I\'92m doing. And


899
1:9:22,25 --> 1:9:28,23
when it comes to this issue, when I say that
we are going to find out exactly what happened,


900
1:9:28,23 --> 1:9:33,17
everybody will be held accountable. And I
am ultimately responsible for what\'92s taking


901
1:9:33,17 --> 1:9:38,37
place there because these are my folks, and
I\'92m the one who has to greet those coffins


902
1:9:38,37 --> 1:9:42,359
when they come home. You know that I mean
what I say.\


903
1:9:42,359 --> 1:9:45,62
CROWLEY: Mr. President, I\'92m going to move
us along. Governor?\


904
1:9:45,62 --> 1:9:50,6
ROMNEY: Thank you Kerry for your question,
it\'92s an important one. And -- and I -- I


905
1:9:50,6 --> 1:9:55,43
think the president just said correctly that
the buck does stop at his desk and -- and


906
1:9:55,43 --> 1:10:1,43
he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for
the failure in providing those security resources,


907
1:10:1,43 --> 1:10:5,46
and -- and those terrible things may well
happen from time to time. I -- I\'92m -- I


908
1:10:5,46 --> 1:10:10,3
feel very deeply sympathetic for the families
of those who lost loved ones. And today there\'92s


909
1:10:10,3 --> 1:10:14,21
a memorial service for one of those that was
lost in this tragedy. We -- we think of their


910
1:10:14,21 --> 1:10:19,22
families and care for them deeply. There were
other issues associated with this -- with


911
1:10:19,22 --> 1:10:25,96
this tragedy. There were many days that passed
before we knew whether this was a spontaneous


912
1:10:25,96 --> 1:10:28,4
demonstration, or actually whether it was
a terrorist attack.\


913
1:10:28,4 --> 1:10:33,45
ROMNEY: And there was no demonstration involved.
It was a terrorist attack and it took a long


914
1:10:33,45 --> 1:10:39,19
time for that to be told to the American people.
Whether there was some misleading, or instead


915
1:10:39,19 --> 1:10:42,16
whether we just didn\'92t know what happened,
you have to ask yourself why didn\'92t we


916
1:10:42,16 --> 1:10:47,58
know five days later when the ambassador to
the United Nations went on TV to say that


917
1:10:47,58 --> 1:10:50,94
this was a demonstration. How could we have
not known?\


918
1:10:50,94 --> 1:10:55,65
But I find more troubling than this, that
on -- on the day following the assassination


919
1:10:55,65 --> 1:11:1,2
of the United States ambassador, the first
time that\'92s happened since 1979, when -- when


920
1:11:1,2 --> 1:11:5,4
we have four Americans killed there, when
apparently we didn\'92t know what happened,


921
1:11:5,4 --> 1:11:10,8
that the president, the day after that happened,
flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser,


922
1:11:10,8 --> 1:11:15,5
then the next day to Colorado for another
event, other political event.\


923
1:11:15,5 --> 1:11:21,9
I think these -- these actions taken by a
president and a leader have symbolic significance


924
1:11:21,9 --> 1:11:25,77
and perhaps even material significance in
that you\'92d hope that during that time we


925
1:11:25,77 --> 1:11:29,24
could call in the people who were actually
eyewitnesses. We\'92ve read their accounts


926
1:11:29,24 --> 1:11:33,59
now about what happened. It was very clear
this was not a demonstration. This was an


927
1:11:33,59 --> 1:11:38,24
attack by terrorists.\
And this calls into question the president\'92s


928
1:11:38,24 --> 1:11:44,89
whole policy in the Middle East. Look what\'92s
happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.


929
1:11:44,89 --> 1:11:48,76
Consider the distance between ourselves and
-- and Israel, the president said that -- that


930
1:11:48,76 --> 1:11:51,14
he was going to put daylight between us and
Israel.\


931
1:11:51,14 --> 1:11:56,79
We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear
bomb. Syria -- Syria\'92s not just a tragedy


932
1:11:56,79 --> 1:12:3,74
of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military,
but also a strategic -- strategically significant


933
1:12:3,74 --> 1:12:6,81
player for America.\
The president\'92s policies throughout the


934
1:12:6,81 --> 1:12:11,57
Middle East began with an apology tour and
-- and -- and pursue a strategy of leading


935
1:12:11,57 --> 1:12:15,91
from behind, and this strategy is unraveling
before our very eyes.\


936
1:12:15,91 --> 1:12:19,97
CROWLEY: Because we\'92re -- we\'92re closing
in, I want to still get a lot of people in.


937
1:12:19,97 --> 1:12:24,3
I want to ask you something, Mr. President,
and then have the governor just quickly.\


938
1:12:24,3 --> 1:12:29,62
Your secretary of state, as I\'92m sure you
know, has said that she takes full responsibility


939
1:12:29,62 --> 1:12:34,5
for the attack on the diplomatic mission in
Benghazi. Does the buck stop with your secretary


940
1:12:34,5 --> 1:12:38,65
of state as far as what went on here?\
OBAMA: Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary


941
1:12:38,65 --> 1:12:45,12
job. But she works for me. I\'92m the president
and I\'92m always responsible, and that\'92s


942
1:12:45,12 --> 1:12:51,3
why nobody\'92s more interested in finding
out exactly what happened than I do.\


943
1:12:51,3 --> 1:12:58,1
The day after the attack, governor, I stood
in the Rose Garden and I told the American


944
1:12:58,1 --> 1:13:2,88
people in the world that we are going to find
out exactly what happened. That this was an


945
1:13:2,88 --> 1:13:8,13
act of terror and I also said that we\'92re
going to hunt down those who committed this


946
1:13:8,13 --> 1:13:13,29
crime.\
And then a few days later, I was there greeting


947
1:13:13,29 --> 1:13:19,83
the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force
Base and grieving with the families.\


948
1:13:19,83 --> 1:13:30,52
And the suggestion that anybody in my team,
whether the Secretary of State, our U.N. Ambassador,


949
1:13:30,52 --> 1:13:36,51
anybody on my team would play politics or
mislead when we\'92ve lost four of our own,


950
1:13:36,51 --> 1:13:44,7
governor, is offensive. That\'92s not what
we do. That\'92s not what I do as president,


951
1:13:44,7 --> 1:13:50,46
that\'92s not what I do as Commander in Chief.\
CROWLEY: Governor, if you want to...\


952
1:13:50,46 --> 1:13:52,3
ROMNEY: Yes, I -- I...\
CROWLEY: ... quickly to this please.\


953
1:13:52,3 --> 1:13:55,55
ROMNEY: I -- I think interesting the president
just said something which -- which is that


954
1:13:55,55 --> 1:13:59,88
on the day after the attack he went into the
Rose Garden and said that this was an act


955
1:13:59,88 --> 1:14:2,16
of terror.\
OBAMA: That\'92s what I said.\


956
1:14:2,16 --> 1:14:8,41
ROMNEY: You said in the Rose Garden the day
after the attack, it was an act of terror.\


957
1:14:8,41 --> 1:14:10,97
It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is
that what you\'92re saying?\


958
1:14:10,97 --> 1:14:15,21
OBAMA: Please proceed governor.\
ROMNEY: I want to make sure we get that for


959
1:14:15,21 --> 1:14:19,85
the record because it took the president 14
days before he called the attack in Benghazi


960
1:14:19,85 --> 1:14:21,56
an act of terror.\
OBAMA: Get the transcript.\


961
1:14:21,56 --> 1:14:25,21
CROWLEY: It -- it -- it -- he did in fact,
sir. So let me -- let me call it an act of


962
1:14:25,21 --> 1:14:27,45
terror...\
OBAMA: Can you say that a little louder, Candy?\


963
1:14:27,45 --> 1:14:35,12
CROWLEY: He -- he did call it an act of terror.
It did as well take -- it did as well take


964
1:14:35,12 --> 1:14:40,54
two weeks or so for the whole idea there being
a riot out there about this tape to come out.


965
1:14:40,54 --> 1:14:42,94
You are correct about that.\
ROMNEY: This -- the administration -- the


966
1:14:42,94 --> 1:14:50,0
administration indicated this was a reaction
to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.\


967
1:14:50,0 --> 1:14:52,13
CROWLEY: It did.\
ROMNEY: It took them a long time to say this


968
1:14:52,13 --> 1:14:58,34
was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.
And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard,


969
1:14:58,34 --> 1:15:2,15
on Sunday, the -- your secretary --\
OBAMA: Candy?\


970
1:15:2,15 --> 1:15:6,27
ROMNEY: Excuse me. The ambassador of the United
Nations went on the Sunday television shows


971
1:15:6,27 --> 1:15:7,68
and spoke about how --\
OBAMA: Candy, I\'92m --\


972
1:15:7,68 --> 1:15:9,34
ROMNEY: -- this was a spontaneous --\
CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me --\


973
1:15:9,34 --> 1:15:10,87
OBAMA: I\'92m happy to have a longer conversation
--\


974
1:15:10,87 --> 1:15:11,62
CROWLEY: I know you --\
OBAMA: -- about foreign policy.\


975
1:15:11,62 --> 1:15:13,67
CROWLEY: Absolutely. But I want to -- I want
to move you on and also --\


976
1:15:13,67 --> 1:15:15,64
OBAMA: OK. I\'92m happy to do that, too.\
CROWLEY: -- the transcripts and --\


977
1:15:15,64 --> 1:15:17,83
OBAMA: I just want to make sure that --\
CROWLEY: -- figure out what we --\


978
1:15:17,83 --> 1:15:21,21
OBAMA: -- all of these wonderful folks are
going to have a chance to get some of their


979
1:15:21,21 --> 1:15:22,52
questions answered.\
CROWLEY: Because what I -- what I want to


980
1:15:22,52 --> 1:15:26,96
do, Mr. President, stand there a second, because
I want to introduce you to Nina Gonzalez,


981
1:15:26,96 --> 1:15:32,46
who brought up a question that we hear a lot,
both over the Internet and from this crowd.\


982
1:15:32,46 --> 1:15:41,29
QUESTION: President Obama, during the Democratic
National Convention in 2008, you stated you


983
1:15:41,29 --> 1:15:48,19
wanted to keep AK-47s out of the hands of
criminals. What has your administration done


984
1:15:48,19 --> 1:15:52,38
or planned to do to limit the availability
of assault weapons?\


985
1:15:52,38 --> 1:15:57,27
OBAMA: We\'92re a nation that believes in
the Second Amendment, and I believe in the


986
1:15:57,27 --> 1:16:5,37
Second Amendment. We\'92ve got a long tradition
of hunting and sportsmen and people who want


987
1:16:5,37 --> 1:16:11,15
to make sure they can protect themselves.\
But there have been too many instances during


988
1:16:11,15 --> 1:16:16,45
the course of my presidency, where I\'92ve
had to comfort families who have lost somebody.


989
1:16:16,45 --> 1:16:23,34
Most recently out in Aurora. You know, just
a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably


990
1:16:23,34 --> 1:16:31,61
about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met
at the bedside of her son, who had been shot


991
1:16:31,61 --> 1:16:37,54
in that theater.\
And her son had been shot through the head.


992
1:16:37,54 --> 1:16:45,81
And we spent some time, and we said a prayer
and, remarkably, about two months later, this


993
1:16:45,81 --> 1:16:54,25
young man and his mom showed up, and he looked
unbelievable, good as new.\


994
1:16:54,25 --> 1:17:0,19
But there were a lot of families who didn\'92t
have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters


995
1:17:0,19 --> 1:17:6,1
or husbands didn\'92t survive.\
So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce


996
1:17:6,1 --> 1:17:10,26
the laws we\'92ve already got, make sure that
we\'92re keeping guns out of the hands of


997
1:17:10,26 --> 1:17:16,57
criminals, those who are mentally ill. We\'92ve
done a much better job in terms of background


998
1:17:16,57 --> 1:17:20,15
checks, but we\'92ve got more to do when it
comes to enforcement.\


999
1:17:20,15 --> 1:17:26,73
But I also share your belief that weapons
that were designed for soldiers in war theaters


1000
1:17:26,73 --> 1:17:33,3
don\'92t belong on our streets. And so what
I\'92m trying to do is to get a broader conversation


1001
1:17:33,3 --> 1:17:41,81
about how do we reduce the violence generally.
Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault


1002
1:17:41,81 --> 1:17:47,4
weapons ban reintroduced. But part of it is
also looking at other sources of the violence.


1003
1:17:47,4 --> 1:17:50,19
Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago,
there\'92s an awful lot of violence and they\'92re


1004
1:17:50,19 --> 1:17:53,65
not using AK-47s. They\'92re using cheap hand
guns.\


1005
1:17:53,65 --> 1:17:59,31
And so what can we do to intervene, to make
sure that young people have opportunity; that


1006
1:17:59,31 --> 1:18:4,77
our schools are working; that if there\'92s
violence on the streets, that working with


1007
1:18:4,77 --> 1:18:9,19
faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch
it before it gets out of control.\


1008
1:18:9,19 --> 1:18:15,71
And so what I want is a -- is a comprehensive
strategy. Part of it is seeing if we can get


1009
1:18:15,71 --> 1:18:22,72
automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing
numbers out of the hands of criminals and


1010
1:18:22,72 --> 1:18:27,8
the mentally ill. But part of it is also going
deeper and seeing if we can get into these


1011
1:18:27,8 --> 1:18:31,5
communities and making sure we catch violent
impulses before they occur.\


1012
1:18:31,5 --> 1:18:34,88
CROWLEY: Governor Romney, the question is
about assault weapons, AK-47s.\


1013
1:18:34,88 --> 1:18:41,2
ROMNEY: Yeah, I\'92m not in favor of new pieces
of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns


1014
1:18:41,2 --> 1:18:45,15
away or making certain guns illegal. We, of
course, don\'92t want to have automatic weapons,


1015
1:18:45,15 --> 1:18:49,78
and that\'92s already illegal in this country
to have automatic weapons. What I believe


1016
1:18:49,78 --> 1:18:53,23
is we have to do, as the president mentioned
towards the end of his remarks there, which


1017
1:18:53,23 --> 1:18:59,58
is to make enormous efforts to enforce the
gun laws that we have, and to change the culture


1018
1:18:59,58 --> 1:19:2,44
of violence that we have.\
And you ask how -- how are we going to do


1019
1:19:2,44 --> 1:19:6,23
that? And there are a number of things. He
mentioned good schools. I totally agree. We


1020
1:19:6,23 --> 1:19:10,59
were able to drive our schools to be number
one in the nation in my state. And I believe


1021
1:19:10,59 --> 1:19:14,3
if we do a better job in education, we\'92ll
-- we\'92ll give people the -- the hope and


1022
1:19:14,3 --> 1:19:17,68
opportunity they deserve and perhaps less
violence from that. But let me mention another


1023
1:19:17,68 --> 1:19:23,84
thing. And that is parents. We need moms and
dads, helping to raise kids. Wherever possible


1024
1:19:23,84 --> 1:19:27,36
the -- the benefit of having two parents in
the home, and that\'92s not always possible.


1025
1:19:27,36 --> 1:19:32,34
A lot of great single moms, single dads. But
gosh to tell our kids that before they have


1026
1:19:32,34 --> 1:19:36,59
babies, they ought to think about getting
married to someone, that\'92s a great idea.\


1027
1:19:36,59 --> 1:19:40,65
Because if there\'92s a two parent family,
the prospect of living in poverty goes down


1028
1:19:40,65 --> 1:19:46,88
dramatically. The opportunities that the child
will -- will be able to achieve increase dramatically.


1029
1:19:46,88 --> 1:19:51,85
So we can make changes in the way our culture
works to help bring people away from violence


1030
1:19:51,85 --> 1:19:56,5
and give them opportunity, and bring them
in the American system. The -- the greatest


1031
1:19:56,5 --> 1:20:0,9
failure we\'92ve had with regards to -- to
gun violence in some respects is what -- what


1032
1:20:0,9 --> 1:20:6,6
is known as Fast and Furious. Which was a
program under this administration, and how


1033
1:20:6,6 --> 1:20:11,75
it worked exactly I think we don\'92t know
precisely, where thousands of automatic, and


1034
1:20:11,75 --> 1:20:18,32
AK-47 type weapons were -- were given to people
that ultimately gave them to -- to drug lords.\


1035
1:20:18,32 --> 1:20:23,15
They used those weapons against -- against
their own citizens and killed Americans with


1036
1:20:23,15 --> 1:20:26,73
them. And this was a -- this was a program
of the government. For what purpose it was


1037
1:20:26,73 --> 1:20:32,31
put in place, I can\'92t imagine. But it\'92s
one of the great tragedies related to violence


1038
1:20:32,31 --> 1:20:36,29
in our society which has occurred during this
administration. Which I think the American


1039
1:20:36,29 --> 1:20:41,6
people would like to understand fully, it\'92s
been investigated to a degree, but -- but


1040
1:20:41,6 --> 1:20:46,97
the administration has carried out executive
privilege to prevent all of the information


1041
1:20:46,97 --> 1:20:49,55
from coming out.\
I\'92d like to understand who it was that


1042
1:20:49,55 --> 1:20:54,88
did this, what the idea was behind it, why
it led to the violence, thousands of guns


1043
1:20:54,88 --> 1:20:58,96
going to Mexican drug lords. OBAMA: Candy?\
CROWLEY: Governor, Governor, if I could, the


1044
1:20:58,96 --> 1:21:5,3
question was about these assault weapons that
once were once banned and are no longer banned.\


1045
1:21:5,3 --> 1:21:9,43
I know that you signed an assault weapons
ban when you were in Massachusetts, obviously,


1046
1:21:9,43 --> 1:21:14,72
with this question, you no longer do support
that. Why is that, given the kind of violence


1047
1:21:14,72 --> 1:21:20,4
that we see sometimes with these mass killings?
Why is it that you have changed your mind?\


1048
1:21:20,4 --> 1:21:25,7
ROMNEY: Well, Candy, actually, in my state,
the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came


1049
1:21:25,7 --> 1:21:31,44
together and put together a piece of legislation.
And it\'92s referred to as an assault weapon


1050
1:21:31,44 --> 1:21:35,93
ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill,
both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came


1051
1:21:35,93 --> 1:21:39,67
together, because it provided opportunities
for both that both wanted.\


1052
1:21:39,67 --> 1:21:42,84
There were hunting opportunities, for instance,
that haven\'92t previously been available


1053
1:21:42,84 --> 1:21:47,11
and so forth, so it was a mutually agreed-
upon piece of legislation. That\'92s what


1054
1:21:47,11 --> 1:21:51,6
we need more of, Candy. What we have right
now in Washington is a place that\'92s gridlocked.\


1055
1:21:51,6 --> 1:21:55,46
CROWLEY: So I could -- if you could get people
to agree to it, you would be for it?\


1056
1:21:55,46 --> 1:21:56,29
ROMNEY: We have --\
OBAMA: Candy?\


1057
1:21:56,29 --> 1:21:59,8
ROMNEY: -- we haven\'92t had the leadership
in Washington to work on a bipartisan basis.


1058
1:21:59,8 --> 1:22:2,84
I was able to do that in my state and bring
these two together.\


1059
1:22:2,84 --> 1:22:8,5
CROWLEY: Quickly, Mr. President.\
OBAMA: The -- first of all, I think Governor


1060
1:22:8,5 --> 1:22:15,25
Romney was for an assault weapons ban before
he was against it. And he said that the reason


1061
1:22:15,25 --> 1:22:19,69
he changed his mind was, in part, because
he was seeking the endorsement of the National


1062
1:22:19,69 --> 1:22:26,94
Rifle Association. So that\'92s on the record.\
But I think that one area we agree on is the


1063
1:22:26,94 --> 1:22:31,96
important of parents and the importance of
schools, because I do believe that if our


1064
1:22:31,96 --> 1:22:37,79
young people have opportunity, then they are
less likely to engage in these kinds of violent


1065
1:22:37,79 --> 1:22:42,92
acts. We\'92re not going to eliminate everybody
who is mentally disturbed and we have got


1066
1:22:42,92 --> 1:22:43,49
to make sure they don\'92t get weapons.\
(AUDIO GAP)\


1067
1:22:43,49 --> 1:22:43,81
OBAMA: because I do believe that if our young
people have opportunity, then they\'92re less


1068
1:22:43,81 --> 1:22:44,0
likely to engage in these kind of violent
acts.\


1069
1:22:44,0 --> 1:22:44,28
We\'92re not going to eliminate everybody
who is mentally disturbed, and we\'92ve got


1070
1:22:44,28 --> 1:22:47,25
to make sure they don\'92t get weapons. But
we can make a difference in terms ensuring


1071
1:22:47,25 --> 1:22:52,24
that every young person in America, regardless
of where they come from, what they look like,


1072
1:22:52,24 --> 1:22:54,89
have a chance to succeed.\
And, Candy, we haven\'92t had a chance to


1073
1:22:54,89 --> 1:23:1,46
talk about education much, but I think it
is very important to understand that the reforms


1074
1:23:1,46 --> 1:23:7,53
we\'92ve put in place, working with 46 governors
around the country, are seeing schools that


1075
1:23:7,53 --> 1:23:12,24
are some of the ones that are the toughest
for kids starting to succeed. We\'92re starting


1076
1:23:12,24 --> 1:23:17,37
to see gains in math and science.\
When it comes to community colleges, we are


1077
1:23:17,37 --> 1:23:24,5
setting up programs, including with Nassau
Community College, to retrain workers, including


1078
1:23:24,5 --> 1:23:28,62
young people who may have dropped out of school
but now are getting another chance, training


1079
1:23:28,62 --> 1:23:34,12
them for the jobs that exist right now.\
And in fact, employers are looking for skilled


1080
1:23:34,12 --> 1:23:39,81
workers. And so we\'92re matching them up.
Giving them access to higher education. As


1081
1:23:39,81 --> 1:23:44,54
I said, we have made sure that millions of
young people are able to get an education


1082
1:23:44,54 --> 1:23:46,37
that they weren\'92t able to get before.\
Now...\


1083
1:23:46,37 --> 1:23:49,73
CROWLEY: Mr. President, I have to -- I have
to move you along here. You said you wanted


1084
1:23:49,73 --> 1:23:50,14
to...\
(CROSSTALK)\


1085
1:23:50,14 --> 1:23:51,62
CROWLEY: We need to do it here.\
OBAMA: But -- but it\'92ll -- it\'92ll -- it\'92ll


1086
1:23:51,62 --> 1:23:51,81
be...\
(CROSSTALK)\


1087
1:23:51,81 --> 1:23:52,99
OBAMA: ... just one second.\
CROWLEY: One...\


1088
1:23:52,99 --> 1:23:57,79
OBAMA: Because -- because this is important.
This is part of the choice in this election.\


1089
1:23:57,79 --> 1:24:3,79
When Governor Romney was asked whether teachers,
hiring more teachers was important to growing


1090
1:24:3,79 --> 1:24:7,27
our economy, Governor Romney said that doesn\'92t
grow our economy.\


1091
1:24:7,27 --> 1:24:9,82
When -- when he was asked would class size...\
(CROSSTALK)\


1092
1:24:9,82 --> 1:24:13,8
CROWLEY: The question, Mr. President, was
guns here, so I need to move us along.\


1093
1:24:13,8 --> 1:24:14,5
OBAMA: I understand.\
CROWLEY: You know, the question was guns.


1094
1:24:14,5 --> 1:24:16,48
So let me -- let me bring in another...\
OBAMA: But this will make a difference in


1095
1:24:16,48 --> 1:24:19,96
terms of whether or not we can move this economy
forward for these young people...\


1096
1:24:19,96 --> 1:24:21,33
CROWLEY: I understand.\
OBAMA: ... and reduce our violence.\


1097
1:24:21,33 --> 1:24:25,29
CROWLEY: OK. Thank you so much.\
I want to ask Carol Goldberg to stand up,


1098
1:24:25,29 --> 1:24:28,35
because she gets to a question that both these
men have been passionate about. It\'92s for


1099
1:24:28,35 --> 1:24:32,64
Governor Romney.\
QUESTION: The outsourcing of American jobs


1100
1:24:32,64 --> 1:24:38,91
overseas has taken a toll on our economy.
What plans do you have to put back and keep


1101
1:24:38,91 --> 1:24:42,93
jobs here in the United States?\
ROMNEY: Boy, great question and important


1102
1:24:42,93 --> 1:24:46,94
question, because you\'92re absolutely right.
The place where we\'92ve seen manufacturing


1103
1:24:46,94 --> 1:24:51,41
go has been China. China is now the largest
manufacturer in the world. It used to be the


1104
1:24:51,41 --> 1:24:56,12
United States of America. A lot of good people
have lost jobs. A half a million manufacturing


1105
1:24:56,12 --> 1:25:0,91
jobs have been lost in the last four years.
That\'92s total over the last four years.\


1106
1:25:0,91 --> 1:25:4,25
One of the reasons for that is that people
think it\'92s more attractive in some cases


1107
1:25:4,25 --> 1:25:9,35
to go offshore than to stay here. We have
made it less attractive for enterprises to


1108
1:25:9,35 --> 1:25:14,6
stay here than to go offshore from time to
time. What I will do as president is make


1109
1:25:14,6 --> 1:25:17,1
sure it\'92s more attractive to come to America
again.\


1110
1:25:17,1 --> 1:25:21,52
This is the way we\'92re going to create jobs
in this country. It\'92s not by trickle-down


1111
1:25:21,52 --> 1:25:25,14
government, saying we\'92re going to take
more money from people and hire more government


1112
1:25:25,14 --> 1:25:30,77
workers, raise more taxes, put in place more
regulations. Trickle-down government has never


1113
1:25:30,77 --> 1:25:35,11
worked here, has never worked anywhere.\
I want to make America the most attractive


1114
1:25:35,11 --> 1:25:41,11
place in the world for entrepreneurs, for
small business, for big business, to invest


1115
1:25:41,11 --> 1:25:45,14
and grow in America.\
Now, we\'92re going to have to make sure that


1116
1:25:45,14 --> 1:25:50,1
as we trade with other nations that they play
by the rules. And China hasn\'92t. One of


1117
1:25:50,1 --> 1:25:53,6
the reasons -- or one of the ways they don\'92t
play by the rules is artificially holding


1118
1:25:53,6 --> 1:25:57,87
down the value of their currency. Because
if they put their currency down low, that


1119
1:25:57,87 --> 1:26:3,21
means their prices on their goods are low.
And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.\


1120
1:26:3,21 --> 1:26:8,64
We lose sales. And manufacturers here in the
U.S. making the same products can\'92t compete.


1121
1:26:8,64 --> 1:26:13,67
China has been a currency manipulator for
years and years and years. And the president


1122
1:26:13,67 --> 1:26:19,46
has a regular opportunity to label them as
a currency manipulator, but refuses to do


1123
1:26:19,46 --> 1:26:23,32
so.\
On day one, I will label China a currency


1124
1:26:23,32 --> 1:26:29,25
manipulator, which will allow me as president
to be able to put in place, if necessary,


1125
1:26:29,25 --> 1:26:34,66
tariffs where I believe that they are taking
unfair advantage of our manufacturers.\


1126
1:26:34,66 --> 1:26:38,19
So we\'92re going to make sure that people
we trade with around the world play by the


1127
1:26:38,19 --> 1:26:44,9
rules. But let me -- let me not just stop
there. Don\'92t forget, what\'92s key to bringing


1128
1:26:44,9 --> 1:26:49,6
back jobs here is not just finding someone
else to punish, and I\'92m going to be strict


1129
1:26:49,6 --> 1:26:52,71
with people who we trade with to make sure
they -- they follow the law and play by the


1130
1:26:52,71 --> 1:26:57,7
rules, but it\'92s also to make America the
most attractive place in the world for businesses


1131
1:26:57,7 --> 1:27:1,31
of all kinds.\
That\'92s why I want to down the tax rates


1132
1:27:1,31 --> 1:27:6,95
on small employers, big employers, so they
want to be here. Canada\'92s tax rate on companies


1133
1:27:6,95 --> 1:27:12,65
is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So
if you\'92re starting a business, where would


1134
1:27:12,65 --> 1:27:18,85
you rather start it? We have to be competitive
if we\'92re going to create more jobs here.\


1135
1:27:18,85 --> 1:27:24,0
Regulations have quadrupled. The rate of regulations
quadrupled under this president. I talk to


1136
1:27:24,0 --> 1:27:27,55
small businesses across the country. They
say, \'93We feel like we\'92re under attack


1137
1:27:27,55 --> 1:27:32,22
from our own government.\'94 I want to make
sure that regulators see their job as encouraging


1138
1:27:32,22 --> 1:27:37,38
small business, not crushing it. And there\'92s
no question but that Obamacare has been an


1139
1:27:37,38 --> 1:27:42,72
extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of
all kinds hiring people.\


1140
1:27:42,72 --> 1:27:48,5
My priority is making sure that we get more
people hired. If we have more people hired,


1141
1:27:48,5 --> 1:27:53,48
if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get
back all kinds of jobs into this country,


1142
1:27:53,48 --> 1:27:57,61
then you\'92re going to see rising incomes
again. The reason incomes are down is because


1143
1:27:57,61 --> 1:28:2,83
unemployment is so high. I know what it takes
to get this to happen, and my plan will do


1144
1:28:2,83 --> 1:28:7,54
that, and one part of it is to make sure that
we keep China playing by the rules.\


1145
1:28:7,54 --> 1:28:12,67
CROWLEY: Mr. President, two minutes here,
because we are then going to go to our last


1146
1:28:12,67 --> 1:28:17,6
question.\
OBAMA: OK. We need to create jobs here. And


1147
1:28:17,6 --> 1:28:20,77
both Governor Romney and I agree actually
that we should lower our corporate tax rate.


1148
1:28:20,77 --> 1:28:25,21
It\'92s too high. But there\'92s a difference
in terms of how we would do it. I want to


1149
1:28:25,21 --> 1:28:32,81
close loopholes that allow companies to deduct
expenses when they move to China; that allow


1150
1:28:32,81 --> 1:28:42,4
them to profit offshore and not have to get
taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore.\


1151
1:28:42,4 --> 1:28:44,78
All those changes in our tax code would make
a difference.\


1152
1:28:44,78 --> 1:28:50,92
Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand
those tax breaks. One of his big ideas when


1153
1:28:50,92 --> 1:28:56,78
it comes to corporate tax reform would be
to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits


1154
1:28:56,78 --> 1:29:2,1
overseas, you don\'92t have to pay U.S. taxes.\
But, of course, if you\'92re a small business


1155
1:29:2,1 --> 1:29:6,36
or a mom-and-pop business or a big business
starting up here, you\'92ve got to pay even


1156
1:29:6,36 --> 1:29:9,34
the reduced rate that Governor Romney\'92s
talking about.\


1157
1:29:9,34 --> 1:29:14,58
And it\'92s estimated that that will create
800,000 new jobs. The problem is they\'92ll


1158
1:29:14,58 --> 1:29:21,4
be in china. Or India. Or Germany.\
That\'92s not the way we\'92re going to create


1159
1:29:21,4 --> 1:29:24,63
jobs here. The way we\'92re going to create
jobs here is not just to change our tax code,


1160
1:29:24,63 --> 1:29:29,58
but also to double our exports. And we are
on pace to double our exports, one of the


1161
1:29:29,58 --> 1:29:34,51
commitments I made when I was president. That\'92s
creating tens of thousands of jobs all across


1162
1:29:34,51 --> 1:29:40,21
the country. That\'92s why we\'92ve kept on
pushing trade deals, but trade deals that


1163
1:29:40,21 --> 1:29:43,95
make sure that American workers and American
businesses are getting a good deal.\


1164
1:29:43,95 --> 1:29:51,61
Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as
I already indicated. In the private sector,


1165
1:29:51,61 --> 1:29:55,84
Governor Romney\'92s company invested in what
were called pioneers of outsourcing. That\'92s


1166
1:29:55,84 --> 1:30:0,57
not my phrase. That\'92s what reporters called
it.\


1167
1:30:0,57 --> 1:30:5,51
And as far as currency manipulation, the currency
has actually gone up 11 percent since I\'92ve


1168
1:30:5,51 --> 1:30:11,1
been president because we have pushed them
hard. And we\'92ve put unprecedented trade


1169
1:30:11,1 --> 1:30:17,42
pressure on China. That\'92s why exports have
significantly increased under my presidency.


1170
1:30:17,42 --> 1:30:20,88
That\'92s going to help to create jobs here.\
CROWLEY: Mr. President, we have a really short


1171
1:30:20,88 --> 1:30:28,5
time for a quick discussion here.\
iPad, the Macs, the iPhones, they are all


1172
1:30:28,5 --> 1:30:33,4
manufactured in China. One of the major reasons
is labor is so much cheaper here. How do you


1173
1:30:33,4 --> 1:30:39,7
convince a great American company to bring
that manufacturing back here?\


1174
1:30:39,7 --> 1:30:44,26
ROMNEY: The answer is very straightforward.
We can compete with anyone in the world as


1175
1:30:44,26 --> 1:30:49,37
long as the playing field is level. China\'92s
been cheating over the years. One by holding


1176
1:30:49,37 --> 1:30:53,87
down the value of their currency. Number two,
by stealing our intellectual property; our


1177
1:30:53,87 --> 1:30:58,0
designs, our patents, our technology. There\'92s
even an Apple store in China that\'92s a counterfeit


1178
1:30:58,0 --> 1:31:3,1
Apple store, selling counterfeit goods. They
hack into our computers. We will have to have


1179
1:31:3,1 --> 1:31:6,43
people play on a fair basis, that\'92s number
one.\


1180
1:31:6,43 --> 1:31:11,67
Number two, we have to make America the most
attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people


1181
1:31:11,67 --> 1:31:16,14
who want to expand their business. That\'92s
what brings jobs in. The president\'92s characterization


1182
1:31:16,14 --> 1:31:17,24
of my tax plan...\
(CROSSTALK)\


1183
1:31:17,24 --> 1:31:18,81
ROMNEY: ...is completely...is completely...\
(CROSSTALK)\


1184
1:31:18,81 --> 1:31:20,57
ROMNEY: ...is completely false. Let me tell
you...\


1185
1:31:20,57 --> 1:31:24,5
CROWLEY: Let me to go the president here because
we really are running out of time. And the


1186
1:31:24,5 --> 1:31:27,34
question is can we ever get -- we can\'92t
get wages like that. It can\'92t be sustained.\


1187
1:31:27,34 --> 1:31:32,1
OBAMA: Candy, there are some jobs that are
not going to come back. Because they are low


1188
1:31:32,1 --> 1:31:39,3
wage, low skill jobs. I want high wage, high
skill jobs. That\'92s why we have to emphasize


1189
1:31:39,3 --> 1:31:43,55
manufacturing. That\'92s why we have to invest
in advanced manufacturing. That\'92s why we\'92ve


1190
1:31:43,55 --> 1:31:46,51
got to make sure that we\'92ve got the best
science and research in the world. And when


1191
1:31:46,51 --> 1:31:53,26
we talk about deficits, if we\'92re adding
to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who


1192
1:31:53,26 --> 1:31:57,28
don\'92t need them, and we\'92re cutting investments
in research and science that will create the


1193
1:31:57,28 --> 1:32:3,65
next Apple, create the next new innovation
that will sell products around the world,


1194
1:32:3,65 --> 1:32:6,99
we will lose that race.\
If we\'92re not training engineers to make


1195
1:32:6,99 --> 1:32:13,3
sure that they are equipped here in this country.
Then companies won\'92t come here. Those investments


1196
1:32:13,3 --> 1:32:18,4
are what\'92s going to help to make sure that
we continue to lead this world economy, not


1197
1:32:18,4 --> 1:32:22,42
just next year, but 10 years from now, 50
years from now, 100 years from now.\


1198
1:32:22,42 --> 1:32:22,97
CROWLEY: Thanks Mr. President.\

1199
1:32:22,97 --> 1:32:25,53
CROWLEY: Governor Romney?\
ROMNEY: Government does not create jobs. Government


1200
1:32:25,53 --> 1:32:27,6
does not create jobs.\
CROWLEY: Governor Romney, I want to introduce


1201
1:32:27,6 --> 1:32:31,63
you to Barry Green, because he\'92s going
to have the last question to you first?\


1202
1:32:31,63 --> 1:32:36,7
ROMNEY: Barry? Where is Barry?\
QUESTION: Hi, Governor. I think this is a


1203
1:32:36,7 --> 1:32:44,86
tough question. To each of you. What do you
believe is the biggest misperception that


1204
1:32:44,86 --> 1:32:51,15
the American people have about you as a man
and a candidate? Using specific examples,


1205
1:32:51,15 --> 1:32:57,61
can you take this opportunity to debunk that
misperception and set us straight?\


1206
1:32:57,61 --> 1:33:2,51
ROMNEY: Thank you, and that\'92s an opportunity
for me, and I appreciate it.\


1207
1:33:2,51 --> 1:33:7,38
In the nature of a campaign, it seems that
some campaigns are focused on attacking a


1208
1:33:7,38 --> 1:33:12,7
person rather than prescribing their own future
and the things they\'92d like to do. In the


1209
1:33:12,7 --> 1:33:16,26
course of that, I think the president\'92s
campaign has tried to characterize me as -- as


1210
1:33:16,26 --> 1:33:18,82
someone who\'92s very different than who I
am.\


1211
1:33:18,82 --> 1:33:23,23
I care about 100 percent of the American people.
I want 100 percent of the American people


1212
1:33:23,23 --> 1:33:28,63
to have a bright and prosperous future. I
care about our kids. I understand what it


1213
1:33:28,63 --> 1:33:33,46
takes to make a bright and prosperous future
for America again. I spent my life in the


1214
1:33:33,46 --> 1:33:38,0
private sector, not in government. I\'92m
a guy who wants to help with the experience


1215
1:33:38,0 --> 1:33:43,15
I have, the American people.\
My -- my passion probably flows from the fact


1216
1:33:43,15 --> 1:33:48,48
that I believe in God. And I believe we\'92re
all children of the same God. I believe we


1217
1:33:48,48 --> 1:33:52,79
have a responsibility to care for one another.
I -- I served as a missionary for my church.


1218
1:33:52,79 --> 1:33:58,18
I served as a pastor in my congregation for
about 10 years. I\'92ve sat across the table


1219
1:33:58,18 --> 1:34:2,88
from people who were out of work and worked
with them to try and find new work or to help


1220
1:34:2,88 --> 1:34:6,52
them through tough times.\
I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble


1221
1:34:6,52 --> 1:34:11,48
to try and get them on track. And as governor
of my state, I was able to get 100 percent


1222
1:34:11,48 --> 1:34:18,1
of my people insured, all my kids, about 98
percent of the adults. I was able also to


1223
1:34:18,1 --> 1:34:21,66
get our schools ranked number one in the nation,
so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright


1224
1:34:21,66 --> 1:34:26,84
opportunity for a future.\
ROMNEY: I understand that I can get this country


1225
1:34:26,84 --> 1:34:29,9
on track again. We don\'92t have to settle
for what we\'92re going through. We don\'92t


1226
1:34:29,9 --> 1:34:34,97
have to settle for gasoline at four bucks.
We don\'92t have to settle for unemployment


1227
1:34:34,97 --> 1:34:39,99
at a chronically high level. We don\'92t have
to settle for 47 million people on food stamps.


1228
1:34:39,99 --> 1:34:43,73
We don\'92t have to settle for 50 percent
of kids coming out of college not able to


1229
1:34:43,73 --> 1:34:49,91
get work. We don\'92t have to settle for 23
million people struggling to find a good job.\


1230
1:34:49,91 --> 1:34:53,94
If I become president, I\'92ll get America
working again. I will get us on track to a


1231
1:34:53,94 --> 1:34:59,27
balanced budget. The president hasn\'92t.
I will. I\'92ll make sure we can reform Medicare


1232
1:34:59,27 --> 1:35:3,34
and Social Security to preserve them for coming
-- coming generations. The president said


1233
1:35:3,34 --> 1:35:5,0
he would. He didn\'92t.\
CROWLEY: Governor...\


1234
1:35:5,0 --> 1:35:9,39
ROMNEY: I\'92ll get our incomes up. And by
the way, I\'92ve done these things. I served


1235
1:35:9,39 --> 1:35:13,8
as governor and showed I could get them done.\
CROWLEY: Mr. President, last two minutes belong


1236
1:35:13,8 --> 1:35:19,91
to you.\
OBAMA: Barry, I think a lot of this campaign,


1237
1:35:19,91 --> 1:35:24,13
maybe over the last four years, has been devoted
to this nation that I think government creates


1238
1:35:24,13 --> 1:35:29,85
jobs, that that somehow is the answer.\
That\'92s not what I believe. I believe that


1239
1:35:29,85 --> 1:35:34,9
the free enterprise system is the greatest
engine of prosperity the world\'92s ever known.\


1240
1:35:34,9 --> 1:35:43,25
I believe in self-reliance and individual
initiative and risk takers being rewarded.


1241
1:35:43,25 --> 1:35:47,68
But I also believe that everybody should have
a fair shot and everybody should do their


1242
1:35:47,68 --> 1:35:53,62
fair share and everybody should play by the
same rules, because that\'92s how our economy\'92s


1243
1:35:53,62 --> 1:35:58,81
grown. That\'92s how we built the world\'92s
greatest middle class.\


1244
1:35:58,81 --> 1:36:3,11
And -- and that is part of what\'92s at stake
in this election. There\'92s a fundamentally


1245
1:36:3,11 --> 1:36:7,5
different vision about how we move our country
forward.\


1246
1:36:7,5 --> 1:36:15,3
I believe Governor Romney is a good man. Loves
his family, cares about his faith. But I also


1247
1:36:15,3 --> 1:36:21,84
believe that when he said behind closed doors
that 47 percent of the country considered


1248
1:36:21,84 --> 1:36:30,45
themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility,
think about who he was talking about.\


1249
1:36:30,45 --> 1:36:36,17
Folks on Social Security who\'92ve worked
all their lives. Veterans who\'92ve sacrificed


1250
1:36:36,17 --> 1:36:43,51
for this country. Students who are out there
trying to hopefully advance their own dreams,


1251
1:36:43,51 --> 1:36:49,82
but also this country\'92s dreams. Soldiers
who are overseas fighting for us right now.


1252
1:36:49,82 --> 1:36:54,47
People who are working hard every day, paying
payroll tax, gas taxes, but don\'92t make


1253
1:36:54,47 --> 1:36:58,51
enough income.\
And I want to fight for them. That\'92s what


1254
1:36:58,51 --> 1:37:3,11
I\'92ve been doing for the last four years.
Because if they succeed, I believe the country


1255
1:37:3,11 --> 1:37:6,24
succeeds.\
When my grandfather fought in World War II


1256
1:37:6,24 --> 1:37:12,44
and he came back and he got a G.I. Bill and
that allowed him to go to college, that wasn\'92t


1257
1:37:12,44 --> 1:37:17,21
a handout. That was something that advanced
the entire country. And I want to make sure


1258
1:37:17,21 --> 1:37:21,57
that the next generation has those same opportunities.
That\'92s why I\'92m asking for your vote


1259
1:37:21,57 --> 1:37:23,53
and that\'92s why I\'92m asking for another
four years.\


1260
1:37:23,53 --> 1:37:27,21
CROWLEY: President Obama, Governor Romney,
thank you for being here tonight.\


1261
1:37:27,21 --> 1:37:29,17
On that note we have come to an end of this
town hall debate. Our thanks to the participants


1262
1:37:29,17 --> 1:37:40,25
for their time and to the people of Hofstra
University for their hospitality.\


1263
1:37:40,25 --> 1:37:42,65
The next and final debate takes place Monday
night at Lynn (ph) University in Boca Raton,


1264
1:37:42,65 --> 1:37:46,58
Florida. Don\'92t forget to watch. Election
Day is three weeks from today. Don\'92t forget


1265
1:37:46,58 --> 1:37:47,39
to vote.\
Good night.\


1266
1:37:47,39 --> 1:39:47,39
(APPLAUSE)}
