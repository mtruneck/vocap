JERRY DUGAN: My name is Jerry
Dugan from FLF Films, formerly


3
0:0:23,64 --> 0:0:24,72
Fall Line Films.


4
0:0:24,72 --> 0:0:29,97
We're in Reno, Nevada, in our
new space that we just got


5
0:0:29,97 --> 0:0:31,3
settled into.


6
0:0:31,3 --> 0:0:33,54
We're up in our edit bay.


7
0:0:33,54 --> 0:0:38,55
"On the Western Front, Project
Six, Snowboarders in Exile."


8
0:0:38,55 --> 0:0:41,59
And I have a whole storage
area that's


9
0:0:41,59 --> 0:0:45,48
got even more tapes.


10
0:0:45,48 --> 0:0:48,1
I got to say we've been doing
this for a little while.


11
0:0:48,1 --> 0:0:51,3
TOM BURT: Pretty much the first
snowboard video that was


12
0:0:51,3 --> 0:0:54,39
put out by anybody was
from Jerry and Arty


13
0:0:54,39 --> 0:0:55,67
and Fall Line films.


14
0:0:55,67 --> 0:0:57,96
TODD RICHARDS: The very first
movie that I ever got was


15
0:0:57,96 --> 0:1:2,3
called "The Western Front,"
and it was completely


16
0:1:2,3 --> 0:1:4,29
different than anything
else I'd ever seen.


17
0:1:4,29 --> 0:1:9,57
At that time, Fall Line made the
movie that everyone wanted


18
0:1:9,57 --> 0:1:12,43
to be in, everyone wanted to see
it, you had to see it, and


19
0:1:12,43 --> 0:1:14,49
it was just insane.


20
0:1:14,49 --> 0:1:15,94
JERRY DUGAN: So here you go.


21
0:1:15,94 --> 0:1:17,19
This is it.


22
0:1:17,19 --> 0:1:20,27



23
0:1:20,27 --> 0:1:22,99
Granted, this is like 1988
or something, '87, it


24
0:1:22,99 --> 0:1:25,18
was a long time ago.


25
0:1:25,18 --> 0:1:29,27
We had this section of paradise
here, and that was


26
0:1:29,27 --> 0:1:31,37
the idea, all is quiet
on the western front.


27
0:1:31,37 --> 0:1:35,76
There's all these screwed up
things happening in the world,


28
0:1:35,76 --> 0:1:38,82
the riots over the Ayatollah
dying, China killing it's own


29
0:1:38,82 --> 0:1:42,55
people for wanting freedom and
basic democratic principles.


30
0:1:42,55 --> 0:1:45,83
We were on the edge of nuclear
war, but we had this little


31
0:1:45,83 --> 0:1:47,66
pocket of pleasure that nothing
really mattered


32
0:1:47,66 --> 0:1:48,75
because we were snowboarding
and we were


33
0:1:48,75 --> 0:1:49,975
super happy about that.


34
0:1:49,975 --> 0:1:52,43
-How about if all the soldiers
in the world traded in their


35
0:1:52,43 --> 0:1:54,65
weapons for snowboards?


36
0:1:54,65 --> 0:1:55,925
-I'm all for it.


37
0:1:55,925 --> 0:1:57,2
-Right on.


38
0:1:57,2 --> 0:1:59,77
DAVE SEOANE: Well the western
front was more like a frozen


39
0:1:59,77 --> 0:2:1,2
discotheque.


40
0:2:1,2 --> 0:2:18,72



41
0:2:18,72 --> 0:2:20,282
STEVE GRAHAM: It was just like a
day and a half of filming in


42
0:2:20,282 --> 0:2:23,8
the late season in
Squaw Valley.


43
0:2:23,8 --> 0:2:26,26
There's a couple fun things.


44
0:2:26,26 --> 0:2:28,59
TOM BURT: "Western Front" was
the first video where it was


45
0:2:28,59 --> 0:2:31,54
like I'd sit there and study.


46
0:2:31,54 --> 0:2:34,59
Just watch it and watch
it and watch it.


47
0:2:34,59 --> 0:2:37,28
We were snowboarding the way we
thought it was supposed to


48
0:2:37,28 --> 0:2:40,62
be, and we were having a good
time at it, but then we saw


49
0:2:40,62 --> 0:2:43,2
this and it completely
changed--


50
0:2:43,2 --> 0:2:45,63
it spoke to me because it was
way more like skating and


51
0:2:45,63 --> 0:2:48,89
everything was really
in slow motion.


52
0:2:48,89 --> 0:2:52,22
When, back east, we were really
herky-jerky with our


53
0:2:52,22 --> 0:2:56,99
tweaks and grabs, and those guys
were super slow, hold it.


54
0:2:56,99 --> 0:2:59,3
We were slapping our boards,
and those guys were holding


55
0:2:59,3 --> 0:3:4,35
everything and really making it
look like one fluid motion.


56
0:3:4,35 --> 0:3:6,25
DAMIAN SANDERS: We would just
go out there and jump jumps


57
0:3:6,25 --> 0:3:8,33
and film with Jerry and
Arty from Fall Line.


58
0:3:8,33 --> 0:3:10,665
And those were way better than
any competition because that


59
0:3:10,665 --> 0:3:11,79
got your name out there
everywhere.


60
0:3:11,79 --> 0:3:13,333
It worked out great.


61
0:3:13,333 --> 0:3:15,78
JERRY DUGAN: I thought what
they were doing was cool.


62
0:3:15,78 --> 0:3:19,47
I'd grown up skating, and
snowboarding was a sport that


63
0:3:19,47 --> 0:3:22,87
I thought was really cool, and
just trying to get cool shots.


64
0:3:22,87 --> 0:3:27,57
No idea what we were going to
do with it and sold 3,000 or


65
0:3:27,57 --> 0:3:29,96
4,000 copies in like 1988.


66
0:3:29,96 --> 0:3:31,49
It was phenomenal, really.


67
0:3:31,49 --> 0:3:34,27
And we used that, then, to go
get sponsorship for the next


68
0:3:34,27 --> 0:3:37,74
year's film, which was
"Snowboarders in Exile."


69
0:3:37,74 --> 0:3:39,42
PAT BRIDGES: Everybody
says, ooh, "Western


70
0:3:39,42 --> 0:3:40,58
Front" changed my life.


71
0:3:40,58 --> 0:3:45,28
What, when you saw half of
it at your buddy's place?


72
0:3:45,28 --> 0:3:46,49
I don't know anybody--


73
0:3:46,49 --> 0:3:48,485
I mean it was like
a mythic video.


74
0:3:48,485 --> 0:3:50,35
Ooh, did you see "Western
Front"?


75
0:3:50,35 --> 0:3:53,77
No, but I saw "Heavy
Metal Parking Lot".


76
0:3:53,77 --> 0:3:55,4
It's like, I don't know.


77
0:3:55,4 --> 0:3:57,67
I think the video that really
had an influence and changed


78
0:3:57,67 --> 0:3:59,53
everybody was "Snowboarders
in Exile".


79
0:3:59,53 --> 0:4:1,595
That was a video that
was huge, and it was


80
0:4:1,595 --> 0:4:4,44
a much better video.


81
0:4:4,44 --> 0:4:6,35
JERRY DUGAN: We'd only made
"All's Quiet on the Western


82
0:4:6,35 --> 0:4:8,77
Front" at this point, so this
was like a real film for us.

[PUNK MUSIC PLAYING]


84
0:4:22,87 --> 0:4:24,92
VIDEO NARRATOR: Up until now,
snowboarders have never had


85
0:4:24,92 --> 0:4:27,31
real movies to call their own.


86
0:4:27,31 --> 0:4:30,58
Small segments in ski movies
just weren't enough.


87
0:4:30,58 --> 0:4:33,67
It was time for a real snowboard
movie to be made.


88
0:4:33,67 --> 0:4:35,99
If for nothing else, for those
people who've watched the


89
0:4:35,99 --> 0:4:38,35
sport grow from it's infancy.


90
0:4:38,35 --> 0:4:40,73
Those people who still remember
being exiled from


91
0:4:40,73 --> 0:4:41,98
most major ski areas.


92
0:4:41,98 --> 0:4:45,95



93
0:4:45,95 --> 0:4:47,48
JERRY DUGAN: When we did
"Snowboarders in Exile," we


94
0:4:47,48 --> 0:4:50,75
tried to follow three guys and
make it more about a story of


95
0:4:50,75 --> 0:4:51,69
three guys.


96
0:4:51,69 --> 0:4:53,68
And it was Seoane, Graham
and Damian.


97
0:4:53,68 --> 0:4:56,2
Other people played into the
movie in different sections


98
0:4:56,2 --> 0:4:59,58
and parts and how
life happens--


99
0:4:59,58 --> 0:5:0,9
we went here, we met
this person and


100
0:5:0,9 --> 0:5:2,6
rode with this person--


101
0:5:2,6 --> 0:5:4,36
but we tried to make it about
them and their life and their


102
0:5:4,36 --> 0:5:4,98
experience.


103
0:5:4,98 --> 0:5:5,82
VIDEO NARRATOR: A
lot has changed


104
0:5:5,82 --> 0:5:7,27
since those early days.


105
0:5:7,27 --> 0:5:10,87
Snowboarders are allowed most
everywhere now, because every


106
0:5:10,87 --> 0:5:19,47
day, people like Damian Sanders,
Steve Graham, Dave


107
0:5:19,47 --> 0:5:27,38
Seoane, and Chris Roach push
snowboarding to the limits.


108
0:5:27,38 --> 0:5:29,97
The problem with taking
something to the limits, is


109
0:5:29,97 --> 0:5:32,28
that most people aren't
ready for them.


110
0:5:32,28 --> 0:5:35,82
New ideas are very rarely
welcomed with open arms.


111
0:5:35,82 --> 0:5:38,56
TODD RICHARDS: There was a
story, and then we went to Val


112
0:5:38,56 --> 0:5:41,88
d'Isere, and that sucked, and
then we went to Tahoe--


113
0:5:41,88 --> 0:5:43,59
and it was cheesy as hell.


114
0:5:43,59 --> 0:5:45,48
You watch it now, you're
like, oh my god, dude.


115
0:5:45,48 --> 0:5:49,0
But at the same time,
that was it.


116
0:5:49,0 --> 0:5:49,97
You just wanted to see that.


117
0:5:49,97 --> 0:5:52,31
You didn't care how stupid
Jerry sounds


118
0:5:52,31 --> 0:5:53,57
narrating his own movie.


119
0:5:53,57 --> 0:5:57,55
It was just amazing because
there was this one tight group


120
0:5:57,55 --> 0:6:0,47
of people and it was like, and
then Damian Sanders and we


121
0:6:0,47 --> 0:6:4,0
went there, and Damian
showed us big air.


122
0:6:4,0 --> 0:6:6,595
It is cheesy, but it's
just awesome.


123
0:6:6,595 --> 0:6:7,2
People ate it up.


124
0:6:7,2 --> 0:6:8,5
I ate it up.


125
0:6:8,5 --> 0:6:9,37
I was like, holy shit,
Damian Sanders.


126
0:6:9,37 --> 0:6:10,55
Awesome.


127
0:6:10,55 --> 0:6:11,82
DAMIAN SANDERS: Jumping is it.


128
0:6:11,82 --> 0:6:13,38
Jumping is what it's
all about.


129
0:6:13,38 --> 0:6:18,41
If you can't jump, this
isn't your sport.


130
0:6:18,41 --> 0:6:20,765
I thank God I met those guys
because I might not have ever


131
0:6:20,765 --> 0:6:21,34
been in that video.


132
0:6:21,34 --> 0:6:22,82
That was a huge career boost.


133
0:6:22,82 --> 0:6:24,28
It was a popularity boost.


134
0:6:24,28 --> 0:6:25,87
It made my whole future
in snowboarding.


135
0:6:25,87 --> 0:6:28,29
DAVE SEOANE: "Snowboarder in
Exile" is a snowboarder who


136
0:6:28,29 --> 0:6:33,314
gets kicked out of the local
resort and having to travel


137
0:6:33,314 --> 0:6:36,929
into the back country or half
way around the world to push


138
0:6:36,929 --> 0:6:38,17
their ability more.


139
0:6:38,17 --> 0:6:42,44
There was a group of us from
Tahoe, and Noah Salasnek, and


140
0:6:42,44 --> 0:6:43,73
I think there was just--


141
0:6:43,73 --> 0:6:46,22
we were all at the right place
at the right time, and it just


142
0:6:46,22 --> 0:6:49,23
worked out that we all kind
of just knew each other.


143
0:6:49,23 --> 0:6:51,34
So it wasn't like we had to
audition or anything.


144
0:6:51,34 --> 0:6:53,61
We kind of had our own little
niche because of the fact that


145
0:6:53,61 --> 0:6:55,72
we didn't really have anything
involved with the contest, and


146
0:6:55,72 --> 0:6:57,2
then we did the films.


147
0:6:57,2 --> 0:7:0,49
And so, with all those films,
that probably gave us a lot of


148
0:7:0,49 --> 0:7:5,42
recognition that we couldn't get
in contests, and it worked


149
0:7:5,42 --> 0:7:7,36
out really well.


150

STEVE GRAHAM: "Snowboarders in

151
0:7:12,58 --> 0:7:14,78

it everywhere.

155
0:7:21,92 --> 0:7:25,9
None of us really knew where
we could go, but that year,


156
0:7:25,9 --> 0:7:27,85
they got us to places.


157
0:7:27,85 --> 0:7:30,8
We stayed three weeks
in Jackson Hole.


158
0:7:30,8 --> 0:7:33,29
At that time, I remember,
because it was unheard of, it


159
0:7:33,29 --> 0:7:36,242
was almost a benefit to us.


160
0:7:36,242 --> 0:7:37,57
It was good.


161
0:7:37,57 --> 0:7:38,95
BRAD KREMER: I would
get so much emotion


162
0:7:38,95 --> 0:7:40,7
out of those movies.


163

I wanted to go to Whistler
and hit the wind whip.

0:7:44,6 --> 0:7:47,82
I wanted to go to Squaw, and I
wanted to go up to Donner.


165
0:7:47,82 --> 0:7:51,95
It's like, he would tell a story
and just draw me into


166
0:7:51,95 --> 0:7:54,76
it, and that was the
amazing thing.


167
0:7:54,76 --> 0:8:0,56
Most movies these days are all
about people sections and


168
0:8:0,56 --> 0:8:2,73
trick, trick, trick and
all this stuff.


169
0:8:2,73 --> 0:8:5,54
But back then it was about
telling a story about what


170
0:8:5,54 --> 0:8:9,32
snowboarding is and about
what the lifestyle is.


171
0:8:9,32 --> 0:8:12,92
And that's what really
influenced me.


172
0:8:12,92 --> 0:8:15,81
Old Fall Line movies, the first
three or four that they


173
0:8:15,81 --> 0:8:19,25
made, that was filmmaking.

just see guys who are taking


176

mountains, doing bigger


177
0:8:30,33 --> 0:8:35,2

spinning more, you wanted to

check out Fall Line Films and
"Snowboarders in Exile."

TOM BURT: Sometimes you're like,
hey, come shoot this


180
0:8:39,83 --> 0:8:44,4
because we found this cliff,
we want to jump off of it.


181
0:8:44,4 --> 0:8:46,93
Or it's good power.


182

hey, what do you think

0:8:48,3 --> 0:8:49,7
about this?

0:9:15,92 --> 0:9:17,56
done at that point.

It's by far at least 22
minutes too long.

so fast that you'd put


190
0:9:25,4 --> 0:9:27,495
something in one week, and the
next week you're like, oh,


191
0:9:27,495 --> 0:9:30,2
yeah, that kind of sucks.

This is the big back flip trick,
and he goes a double.

oh, you butt checked.

DAVE SEOANE: People were so
happy with the film, and it


200
0:9:54,67 --> 0:9:58,26
definitely pushed us to do
something a little more


201
0:9:58,26 --> 0:9:59,37
spectacular.


202
0:9:59,37 --> 0:10:3,4
That just means going off
something bigger and


203
0:10:3,4 --> 0:10:5,9
a little more risk.


204
0:10:5,9 --> 0:10:11,437
They had a premiere at ASR in
San Diego for "Snowboarders in


205
0:10:11,437 --> 0:10:15,245
Exile." And we had no idea what
was going to happen, and


206
0:10:15,245 --> 0:10:18,2
it was really nice that there
was a lot of people that


207
0:10:18,2 --> 0:10:21,65
showed up, and then it was
something to be really proud


208
0:10:21,65 --> 0:10:23,28
of being part of.


209
0:10:23,28 --> 0:10:26,11
So after the film, people
were like, no way!


210
0:10:26,11 --> 0:10:27,49
That was a good feeling.


211
0:10:27,49 --> 0:10:31,43
JERRY DUGAN: It was the first
time there were like 500 of


212
0:10:31,43 --> 0:10:34,43
the industry's top pros and
industry people all in one


213
0:10:34,43 --> 0:10:37,11
spot, and no one had ever really
done a premiere like


214
0:10:37,11 --> 0:10:37,98
this before.


215
0:10:37,98 --> 0:10:43,58
And we had this, at the ASR
trade show in the fall, it was


216
0:10:43,58 --> 0:10:47,2
for sure highlight of
everything, playing this film


217
0:10:47,2 --> 0:10:48,92
for all those people.


218
0:10:48,92 --> 0:10:51,99
DAMIAN SANDERS: And that was
like the complete career


219
0:10:51,99 --> 0:10:52,87
changing moment.


220
0:10:52,87 --> 0:10:54,81
Everybody saw that video and saw
what was really going on


221
0:10:54,81 --> 0:10:56,61
in snowboarding outside of
their little home resort.


222
0:10:56,61 --> 0:10:58,54
And couldn't believe that people
were jumping flips off


223
0:10:58,54 --> 0:11:1,34
of cliffs and 360s off of 60
foot cliffs and things.


224
0:11:1,34 --> 0:11:2,66
It made us all instant
superstars.


225
0:11:2,66 --> 0:11:3,73
It was killer.


226
0:11:3,73 --> 0:11:4,77
JERRY DUGAN: Did the video
make them, or did


227
0:11:4,77 --> 0:11:6,36
they make the video?


228
0:11:6,36 --> 0:11:7,55
Were those guys talented?


229
0:11:7,55 --> 0:11:8,64
Absolutely.


230
0:11:8,64 --> 0:11:11,5
Would they have gone on to what
they had gone on to had


231
0:11:11,5 --> 0:11:12,476
it not been for the video?


232
0:11:12,476 --> 0:11:14,3
Possibly, possibly not.


233
0:11:14,3 --> 0:11:15,15
Did it help?


234
0:11:15,15 --> 0:11:15,98
For sure.


235
0:11:15,98 --> 0:11:16,86
Did it make them?


236
0:11:16,86 --> 0:11:18,5
No, they made themselves.


237
0:11:18,5 --> 0:11:21,45
But it for sure was in
conjunction to where


238
0:11:21,45 --> 0:11:24,66
they all went to.


239
0:11:24,66 --> 0:11:26,34
Yeah, maybe we did create
the video pro.


240
0:11:26,34 --> 0:13:26,34
