SUROOSH ALVI: It's late.

0:0:12,63 --> 0:0:16,186
We're deep in the
heart of it now.


4
0:0:16,186 --> 0:0:18,56
I don't know how much
water we have.

0:0:18,56 --> 0:0:20,92
We haven't eaten in a
really long time.


6
0:0:20,92 --> 0:0:24,55
And my glasses are fogging
up because it's so hot.

0:0:24,55 --> 0:0:25,28
And I can't see.

0:0:25,28 --> 0:0:28,68

I think this might
be the stupidest

12
0:0:32,214 --> 0:0:45,15



13
0:0:45,15 --> 0:0:47,29
The Democratic Republic
of Congo.


14
0:0:47,29 --> 0:0:49,73
It's one of the poorest
countries in the world, and


15
0:0:49,73 --> 0:0:53,5
thanks to insanely complicated
mix of politics, armed


16
0:0:53,5 --> 0:0:55,99
conflict, and corruption, it's
also one of the most


17
0:0:55,99 --> 0:0:57,71
under-reported.


18
0:0:57,71 --> 0:1:1,37
It also happens to be home to a
nondescript black rock known


19
0:1:1,37 --> 0:1:4,65
as coltan, a vital ingredient
in the production of nearly


20
0:1:4,65 --> 0:1:7,16
every cell phone and computer
on the planet.


21
0:1:7,16 --> 0:1:10,68
Without coltan, our
technology-driven lives would


22
0:1:10,68 --> 0:1:12,572
come to a screeching halt.


23
0:1:12,572 --> 0:1:16,3
And Congo has 80% of
the world's supply.


24
0:1:16,3 --> 0:1:22,475



25
0:1:22,475 --> 0:1:25,9
Congo also has cassiterite,
gold, and a slew of other


26
0:1:25,9 --> 0:1:27,29
minerals that make the
world go round.


27
0:1:27,29 --> 0:1:30,559



28
0:1:30,559 --> 0:1:32,87
Now, you'd think that having so
much of the stuff would be


29
0:1:32,87 --> 0:1:35,96
good for Congo, but the reality
is far from the case.


30
0:1:35,96 --> 0:1:38,18
There's a reason they're called
conflict minerals.

[SHOUTING]


32
0:1:41,77 --> 0:1:44,21
SUROOSH ALVI: Since the mid
1990s, armed groups have used


33
0:1:44,21 --> 0:1:46,74
these minerals to fund a
series of fantastically


34
0:1:46,74 --> 0:1:49,57
complicated and horrifically
violent wars.


35
0:1:49,57 --> 0:1:50,85

We have to kill them.


37
0:1:52,51 --> 0:1:54,465
SUROOSH ALVI: And as the tech
boom drove up the price of


38
0:1:54,465 --> 0:1:56,19
these minerals, violence
skyrocketed.


39
0:1:56,19 --> 0:2:3,64



40
0:2:3,64 --> 0:2:6,9
Slaves to technology that we
are, we had see for ourselves


41
0:2:6,9 --> 0:2:9,15
where these minerals were coming
from and what these


42
0:2:9,15 --> 0:2:10,93
rebels were fighting for.

SUROOSH ALVI: So together with
my cameraman Jake and producer


45
0:2:16,41 --> 0:2:19,375
Jason, we hopped on a plane
and flew to Congo.


46
0:2:19,375 --> 0:2:26,21



47
0:2:26,21 --> 0:2:27,7
Our first stop was Kinshasa.


48
0:2:27,7 --> 0:2:36,72



49
0:2:36,72 --> 0:2:38,66
To say that Congo's natural
resources have been more of a


50
0:2:38,66 --> 0:2:41,85
curse than a blessing would
be an understatement.


51
0:2:41,85 --> 0:2:44,745
Conrad described this place as
"the vilest scramble for loot


52
0:2:44,745 --> 0:2:47,7
that has ever disfigured the
human conscience." That was


53
0:2:47,7 --> 0:2:50,839
written in the 1800s, right
around the time that Belgian


54
0:2:50,839 --> 0:2:53,5
colonists were stripping the
country of its rich supply of


55
0:2:53,5 --> 0:2:56,54
ivory and rubber, killing nearly
half the population in


56
0:2:56,54 --> 0:2:58,2
the process.


57
0:2:58,2 --> 0:3:1,585
In the 1960s, it was the United
States that was after


58
0:3:1,585 --> 0:3:4,715
Congo's cobalt for its Cold War
fighter jets, leading to


59
0:3:4,715 --> 0:3:8,336
its support for a dictator who
renamed the country Zaire and


60
0:3:8,336 --> 0:3:10,32
embezzled billions of dollars.

0:3:11,808 --> 0:3:15,79



63
0:3:15,79 --> 0:3:18,16
SUROOSH ALVI: Today, it's the
global demand for technology


64
0:3:18,16 --> 0:3:22,7
that is inadvertently fueling
the conflict in Congo.


65
0:3:22,7 --> 0:3:24,92
The statistics we read
are staggering.


66
0:3:24,92 --> 0:3:28,43
Five million people have died
in the Congo because of this


67
0:3:28,43 --> 0:3:32,82
conflict since the mid '90s
until about 2007.


68
0:3:32,82 --> 0:3:33,8
It's a huge number.


69
0:3:33,8 --> 0:3:37,37
The most since any war
since World War II.


70
0:3:37,37 --> 0:3:40,5
The government in Kinshasa says
that the war is over, but


71
0:3:40,5 --> 0:3:43,5
Kinshasa is a long way from the
jungles of eastern Congo,


72
0:3:43,5 --> 0:3:45,86
where most of the rebel groups
and the minerals that finance


73
0:3:45,86 --> 0:3:47,83
them are located.


74
0:3:47,83 --> 0:3:49,51
So we needed to go east
to find out what was


75
0:3:49,51 --> 0:3:50,76
really going on.


76
0:3:50,76 --> 0:3:53,1



77
0:3:53,1 --> 0:3:54,79
One thing that had been drilled
into our heads before


78
0:3:54,79 --> 0:3:56,895
we came to Congo was
that you do not fly


79
0:3:56,895 --> 0:3:58,86
on Congolese airlines.


80
0:3:58,86 --> 0:4:0,93
This is a country whose aircraft
are banned from


81
0:4:0,93 --> 0:4:2,65
European airspace.


82
0:4:2,65 --> 0:4:5,89
Last year, a crash that killed
20 people was the result of a


83
0:4:5,89 --> 0:4:10,7
crocodile escaping from a
passenger's carry on luggage.


84
0:4:10,7 --> 0:4:12,8
But with Goma being over 1,000
miles away, we didn't have


85
0:4:12,8 --> 0:4:14,5
much of a choice.


86
0:4:14,5 --> 0:4:15,97



87
0:4:15,97 --> 0:4:17,7
And as it turned out, that
flight would be the most


88
0:4:17,7 --> 0:4:19,47
comfortable experience
of the days to come.


89
0:4:19,47 --> 0:4:31,15



90
0:4:31,15 --> 0:4:33,25
One thing we've noticed since we
came here is that there are


91
0:4:33,25 --> 0:4:35,49
fires burning everywhere
in Congo.


92
0:4:35,49 --> 0:4:37,46
I guess they're just burning
their garbage.


93
0:4:37,46 --> 0:4:40,61
But it kind of feels apocalyptic
at times.


94
0:4:40,61 --> 0:4:41,86
Watch out.


95
0:4:41,86 --> 0:4:56,72



96
0:4:56,72 --> 0:4:57,85
We're in Goma.


97
0:4:57,85 --> 0:5:1,45
It's in eastern Congo, right
on the Rwandan border.


98
0:5:1,45 --> 0:5:4,98
This has been the epicenter of
the conflict since 1994.


99
0:5:4,98 --> 0:5:6,88
It's also the center for
humanitarian aid.


100
0:5:6,88 --> 0:5:8,91
There are 51 different
international organizations


101
0:5:8,91 --> 0:5:9,66
based here.


102
0:5:9,66 --> 0:5:13,89
As you can see, there's UN guys
everywhere around us.


103
0:5:13,89 --> 0:5:16,15
It's kind of chaotic.


104
0:5:16,15 --> 0:5:19,43
We're also pretty close to
the mines where coltan is


105
0:5:19,43 --> 0:5:23,51
extracted from, and we're going
to go check that out.


106
0:5:23,51 --> 0:5:26,59
When we got to Goma, we met up
with Tim Freccia, a veteran


107
0:5:26,59 --> 0:5:28,96
crisis and conflict photographer
who has worked in


108
0:5:28,96 --> 0:5:30,4
Congo for years.


109
0:5:30,4 --> 0:5:32,3
He told us that we were
under-dressed for our trip to


110
0:5:32,3 --> 0:5:36,71
the cold mountain mining town of
Numbi, so we went shopping.


111
0:5:36,71 --> 0:5:39,31
I've got a nice polo here.


112
0:5:39,31 --> 0:5:42,71
I got a Minnesota Golden
Gophers hoodie.


113
0:5:42,71 --> 0:5:44,26
Jake got a great Carhartt.


114
0:5:44,26 --> 0:5:48,12
But I think this might be a
strong look when I'm going to


115
0:5:48,12 --> 0:5:49,16

SUROOSH ALVI: Nice
to meet you.


204
0:9:55,33 --> 0:9:57,53
[FRENCH].


205
0:9:57,53 --> 0:9:58,73
This way.


206
0:9:58,73 --> 0:10:1,8
In what would become a running
theme for the rest of our


207
0:10:1,8 --> 0:10:3,54
trip, the locals said the mines
were just over there


208
0:10:3,54 --> 0:10:5,34
around the bend.


209
0:10:5,34 --> 0:10:7,65
And then we would get over there
and around the bend,


210
0:10:7,65 --> 0:10:11,836
they were just over there,
and over the hill.


211
0:10:11,836 --> 0:10:13,848
Like a quick two kilometers.


212
0:10:13,848 --> 0:10:15,98
Holy fuck.


213
0:10:15,98 --> 0:10:21,99



214
0:10:21,99 --> 0:10:25,54
I'm about to pass out, Jake.


215
0:10:25,54 --> 0:10:27,39
Hey Jake, how many people
are working?


216
0:10:27,39 --> 0:10:28,29
JAKE BURGHART: None.


217
0:10:28,29 --> 0:10:29,5
SUROOSH ALVI: Really?


218
0:10:29,5 --> 0:10:30,255
JAKE BURGHART: They've
all gone home.


219
0:10:30,255 --> 0:10:32,83
We have to come back tomorrow.


220
0:10:32,83 --> 0:10:34,445
SUROOSH ALVI: The mine
had no miners.


221
0:10:34,445 --> 0:10:36,695
It was completely empty.


222
0:10:36,695 --> 0:10:39,68
The locals told us that this
mine in particular is owned by


223
0:10:39,68 --> 0:10:42,66
a member of Congo Senate who
lives in Kinshasa, and that


224
0:10:42,66 --> 0:10:46,39
his miners pull 15 kilos of
coltan out of it every day.


225
0:10:46,39 --> 0:10:50,96
At $30 a kilo, that's about
$13,000 a month, a lot of


226
0:10:50,96 --> 0:10:53,31
money in a country where most of
the people survive on less


227
0:10:53,31 --> 0:10:55,846
than $1 a day.


228
0:10:55,846 --> 0:10:59,37
And while the senator gets the
big rocks, the bottom feeders


229
0:10:59,37 --> 0:11:1,8
get by on what washes
down the stream.


230
0:11:1,8 --> 0:11:3,6



231
0:11:3,6 --> 0:11:5,32
So we got totally set up.


232
0:11:5,32 --> 0:11:7,133
Basically when we pulled
into town.


233
0:11:7,133 --> 0:11:9,7
MALE SPEAKER: Lower, lower,
lower your voice.


234
0:11:9,7 --> 0:11:10,89
SUROOSH ALVI: Basically
we got totally set up.


235
0:11:10,89 --> 0:11:13,51
When we pulled into town,
alarm bells went off.


236
0:11:13,51 --> 0:11:15,355
And they said yeah, we'll show
you a mine, and they took us


237
0:11:15,355 --> 0:11:20,815
on a trek far, far away from
town to a mine where they sent


238
0:11:20,815 --> 0:11:24,12
in advance someone ahead of us
to clear everyone out because


239
0:11:24,12 --> 0:11:25,39
there were kids working
in the mine.


240
0:11:25,39 --> 0:11:27,385
Then we got there, and they're
like, oh, yeah, everybody's


241
0:11:27,385 --> 0:11:28,79
just gone home for the day.


242
0:11:28,79 --> 0:11:32,21
They actually fessed up to that
to Horeb, to our guy, so,


243
0:11:32,21 --> 0:11:33,46
I'm still pissed off.


244
0:11:33,46 --> 0:11:36,64



245
0:11:36,64 --> 0:11:38,81
It's gonna be an interesting
night.


246
0:11:38,81 --> 0:11:49,865



247
0:11:49,865 --> 0:11:53,85
Probably about 5:30 in the
morning here in the Numbi


248
0:11:53,85 --> 0:11:56,36
mining town.


249
0:11:56,36 --> 0:11:58,485
This is a town with
no electricity,


250
0:11:58,485 --> 0:12:0,73
with no running water.


251
0:12:0,73 --> 0:12:3,59
We basically got stranded out
here, which wasn't really part


252
0:12:3,59 --> 0:12:4,68
of the plan.


253
0:12:4,68 --> 0:12:7,76
They didn't take too kindly to
us initially, but they were


254
0:12:7,76 --> 0:12:10,69
even worried about our safety,
because we're in South Kivu,


255
0:12:10,69 --> 0:12:12,855
and they're not used to
this kind of thing.


256
0:12:12,855 --> 0:12:15,2
A bunch of foreigners spending
a night here.


257
0:12:15,2 --> 0:12:17,38
They gave us this little
house to stay in.


258
0:12:17,38 --> 0:12:20,28
Then they offered us a couple
soldiers to guard


259
0:12:20,28 --> 0:12:21,595
us all night long.


260
0:12:21,595 --> 0:12:25,16
You know, yesterday we
experienced them trying to


261
0:12:25,16 --> 0:12:27,69
keep some secrets hidden.


262
0:12:27,69 --> 0:12:28,87
So today we have a plan.


263
0:12:28,87 --> 0:12:29,77
We're going to break free.


264
0:12:29,77 --> 0:12:31,83
We're going to go a couple
kilometers, and we're going to


265
0:12:31,83 --> 0:12:34,11
set up and wait for the miners
to show up so we can really


266
0:12:34,11 --> 0:12:35,36
see how these mines operate.


267
0:12:35,36 --> 0:12:39,85



268
0:12:39,85 --> 0:12:43,45
This is the main street of
the Numbi mining town.


269
0:12:43,45 --> 0:12:46,31
It's very muddy today, after
raining all night.


270
0:12:46,31 --> 0:12:48,4
It reeks of urine.


271
0:12:48,4 --> 0:12:52,0
Here's my breakfast, along with
two Advils and some kind


272
0:12:52,0 --> 0:12:55,43
of mega antibiotic cure all.


273
0:12:55,43 --> 0:12:58,62
When anything goes wrong in
Africa, you take that pill.


274
0:12:58,62 --> 0:13:2,26
Plugs up your ass,
reduces fever.


275
0:13:2,26 --> 0:13:4,2
Well, so much for getting a
head start on everyone.


276
0:13:4,2 --> 0:13:13,415



277
0:13:13,415 --> 0:13:14,76
Oh, shit.


278
0:13:14,76 --> 0:13:16,1
Jason, Jason, come here.


279
0:13:16,1 --> 0:13:18,73



280
0:13:18,73 --> 0:13:19,98
I think it's like, quicksand.


281
0:13:19,98 --> 0:13:22,37



282
0:13:22,37 --> 0:13:24,56
I just kept going down.


283
0:13:24,56 --> 0:13:26,9
This is not going to be fun.


284
0:13:26,9 --> 0:13:42,58



285
0:13:42,58 --> 0:13:43,18
This is the main Numbi mine.


286
0:13:43,18 --> 0:13:45,79
Just got there.


287
0:13:45,79 --> 0:13:49,745
These houses are all miners
who work right here.


288
0:13:49,745 --> 0:14:8,83



289
0:14:8,83 --> 0:14:11,21
It took two days of trekking
and looking.


290
0:14:11,21 --> 0:14:12,885
We're finally here in the
heart of the mine.


291
0:14:12,885 --> 0:14:20,32



292
0:14:20,32 --> 0:14:23,49
This is where all kinds of
minerals are coming out of,


293
0:14:23,49 --> 0:14:27,5
everything from tantalum
to coltan.


294
0:14:27,5 --> 0:14:29,16
MALE SPEAKER: This is what
you call tourmaline.


295
0:14:29,16 --> 0:14:31,45
I can show you one that
is the biggest one.

[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE].


297
0:14:33,74 --> 0:14:37,72
They say that this is
the most expensive.


298
0:14:37,72 --> 0:14:39,45
This is where they get it.


299
0:14:39,45 --> 0:14:43,14
You can see that this man is
fortunate, because he got this


300
0:14:43,14 --> 0:14:44,64
block of stone, which
has everything.


301
0:14:44,64 --> 0:14:45,1
SUROOSH ALVI: A lot inside.


302
0:14:45,1 --> 0:14:47,74
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it
has a lot inside.


303
0:14:47,74 --> 0:14:50,37
SUROOSH ALVI: It seems so
primitive, with their bare


304
0:14:50,37 --> 0:14:51,695
hands, and with shovels.


305
0:14:51,695 --> 0:14:55,11
They're pulling it out, and a
lot of it ends up in super


306
0:14:55,11 --> 0:14:56,33
high tech devices.


307
0:14:56,33 --> 0:15:0,3
And you never think when you're
using those devices


308
0:15:0,3 --> 0:15:3,8
back home, that this is how
it actually starts.


309
0:15:3,8 --> 0:15:6,2
And that without this process,
it wouldn't exist, or it


310
0:15:6,2 --> 0:15:7,68
wouldn't work.


311
0:15:7,68 --> 0:15:9,79
The mine that we finally saw
was so different from the


312
0:15:9,79 --> 0:15:11,25
horror stories that
we had heard.


313
0:15:11,25 --> 0:15:14,19
We were expecting to see forced
child labor, inhumane


314

conditions, and rebels
everywhere.


315
0:15:15,81 --> 0:15:19,17



316
0:15:19,17 --> 0:15:21,45
Maybe things were changing in
eastern Congo, or at least


317
0:15:21,45 --> 0:15:23,84
that's how this mine
made it seem.


318
0:15:23,84 --> 0:15:26,72
In recent years, activist
organizations in the US and


319
0:15:26,72 --> 0:15:29,47
Europe have been pressuring
electronics companies into


320
0:15:29,47 --> 0:15:31,94
taking greater responsibility
for keeping rebels out of


321
0:15:31,94 --> 0:15:32,85
their supply chain.


322
0:15:32,85 --> 0:15:36,87
And in 2010, the US Congress
passed legislation forcing


323
0:15:36,87 --> 0:15:40,208
companies to declare their
use of conflict minerals.

credit for this change?

0:15:58,9 --> 0:16:0,14
Is it the government
in Kinshasha?

SUROOSH ALVI: Why did
the government want


331
0:16:14,43 --> 0:16:15,31
to make these changes?


332
0:16:15,31 --> 0:16:19,2
Was it because of the pressure
of western corporations and


333

0:16:22,73 --> 0:16:37,32

SUROOSH ALVI: Things seemed so
peaceful that it was hard to


337
0:16:39,15 --> 0:16:42,15
imagine that there was
ever a war here.


338
0:16:42,15 --> 0:16:45,5
Everything that we've been
walking on, during the like,


339
0:16:45,5 --> 0:16:49,53
second Congolese war, this
was like a battlefield.


340
0:16:49,53 --> 0:16:52,74
The mine was an almost picture
perfect symbol of progress,


341
0:16:52,74 --> 0:16:55,3
but I couldn't help but wonder
how long it would be before a


342
0:16:55,3 --> 0:16:58,467
bunch of guys showed up with
guns and screwed it all up.


343
0:16:58,467 --> 0:17:0,852
TIM FRECCIA: That's the whole
point with conflict minerals


344
0:17:0,852 --> 0:17:5,1
is it's in every businessman's
interest to


345
0:17:5,1 --> 0:17:6,15
keep conflict going.


346
0:17:6,15 --> 0:17:9,73
Then there's no control,
there's no government.


347
0:17:9,73 --> 0:17:10,969
There's nobody watching

coltan storage facility.


352
0:17:19,57 --> 0:17:22,265

nicest building in town.

0:17:40,47 --> 0:17:42,16
This is coltan.

This is what it's all about.

We struggled for two days to
find the mines, and eventually


371
0:18:7,7 --> 0:18:10,48
we got there.


372
0:18:10,48 --> 0:18:13,26
We are going back to Goma on
motorcycles because roads are


373
0:18:13,26 --> 0:18:15,75
so bad now, and so dangerous
that they're saying that a

0:18:20,92 --> 0:18:23,2
We'd seen one of the mines
where coltan comes from.


377
0:18:23,2 --> 0:18:25,26
We're happy that the conditions
there seem to be


378
0:18:25,26 --> 0:18:28,45
improving, but with so many
armed groups operating in


379
0:18:28,45 --> 0:18:31,125
eastern Congo, that could
change in an instant.


380
0:18:31,125 --> 0:18:34,1
But where did all these rebels
come from in the first place?


381
0:18:34,1 --> 0:18:43,52



382
0:18:43,52 --> 0:18:46,25
Most people know about
the Rwandan genocide.

0:18:47,98 --> 0:18:51,93
But few understand how it led to
a war in neighboring Congo.

streaming across the border.

the Hutu soldiers

0:18:59,59 --> 0:19:1,6
involved in the genocide.

Tutsi leadership in

They can fly, they
can disappear.

0:19:35,525 --> 0:19:38,15
And bullets pass through
them like water.

Going to that area

It's something like going

the night there, if we shall
assure that nobody will beat

0:21:52,12 --> 0:21:54,726
them, and nobody will
traumatize them.

of the situation we were heading
into began to sink in.


451

The various rebel groups that
still occupy much of the bush


452
0:22:5,6 --> 0:22:8,4

And this is the UN

472
0:23:44,89 --> 0:23:48,63
We had to register with
them, which kind of


473
0:23:48,63 --> 0:23:49,97
makes me a bit nervous.

0:23:49,97 --> 0:23:53,21
They say it's just a formality
in case something happens.


475
0:23:53,21 --> 0:23:56,6
The Congolese government
doesn't really have any

And then we were standing there,
and I just thought, we

should just ask them if we can
sleep here, because I don't


502
0:24:25,54 --> 0:24:29,1
like the idea of if our
motorcycle guys show up, we go


503
0:24:29,1 --> 0:24:32,11
six kilometers with them, and
then it's going to get dark,


504
0:24:32,11 --> 0:24:34,8
it's going to rain, and we're
gong to be wandering through


505
0:24:34,8 --> 0:24:38,55
the Congolese jungle in
the dark, trying to


506
0:24:38,55 --> 0:24:39,46

Just as I was getting
comfortable, the motorcycles

Congolese military, the FARDC,

around the edges.

about these guys

these guys were the dreaded
Rwandan Hutu rebels, the FDLR.


522

HOREB BUJAMBO: I knew that these
people we met on the way


525
0:25:32,33 --> 0:25:36,69
were Rwandans and not Mai Mai
just because they were


526
0:25:36,69 --> 0:25:38,37

that for some reason,


535

the Mai Mai and the FDLR were
working together, but it


536
0:26:12,21 --> 0:26:14,37
wasn't until the creepy
commander of their outpost


537
0:26:14,37 --> 0:26:16,65
gave us four of his armed guards
to take us to the Mai


538

believed it.

We are way off the grid,

567
0:28:10,8 --> 0:28:14,97
We're so far out here that the
UN jurisdiction ended, and


568

then the Congolese government

588
0:29:4,18 --> 0:29:6,34
known as the APCLS.


589
0:29:6,34 --> 0:29:8,93
The thing about rebel leaders
is that much of their power


590
0:29:8,93 --> 0:29:9,89
lies in their mystique.


591
0:29:9,89 --> 0:29:13,6
They don't want to seem
overeager to meet the press.


592
0:29:13,6 --> 0:29:15,5
So we had a wait around until
the general could carve some


593
0:29:15,5 --> 0:29:18,57
time out of his busy schedule
to meet with us.


594
0:29:18,57 --> 0:29:19,82
MALE SPEAKER: He looks
like Chuck Norris.


595
0:29:19,82 --> 0:29:23,36



596
0:29:23,36 --> 0:29:25,8
SUROOSH ALVI: In the meantime,
we hung out


597
0:29:25,8 --> 0:29:26,33
with some of his soldiers.


598
0:29:26,33 --> 0:29:33,39



599
0:29:33,39 --> 0:29:35,5
Horeb, how many times
has he been shot?

SUROOSH ALVI: When they say
Tutsis, it's shorthand for the

0:29:54,64 --> 0:29:56,25
Rwandan government,
who they blame for


611
0:29:56,25 --> 0:29:58,55
most of Congo's problems.

617
0:30:12,53 --> 0:30:12,89
HOREB BUJAMBO: Bobby.


618
0:30:12,89 --> 0:30:14,33
SUROOSH ALVI: Bobby.


619
0:30:14,33 --> 0:30:17,34
HOREB BUJAMBO: They say that
Bobby has also battled and


620
0:30:17,34 --> 0:30:19,34
contributed to many fighting.


621
0:30:19,34 --> 0:30:20,74
SUROOSH ALVI: Really?


622
0:30:20,74 --> 0:30:22,506
But he looks so nice.


623
0:30:22,506 --> 0:30:26,4
He just winked at me.

0:30:28,49 --> 0:30:33,32



626
0:30:33,32 --> 0:30:34,72
SUROOSH ALVI: Just as our friend
was ordered to stop


627
0:30:34,72 --> 0:30:37,33
speaking, we received word that
the general was finally


628
0:30:37,33 --> 0:30:38,58
ready to see us.


629
0:30:38,58 --> 0:30:41,53
But in order to do so, we had to
cross one of the sketchiest


630
0:30:41,53 --> 0:30:44,396
Lord of the Flies- esque
bridges imaginable.


631
0:30:44,396 --> 0:30:47,61
Then we were led to an even
more remote encampment.


632
0:30:47,61 --> 0:30:50,53
Then, after being surrounded
by heavily armed guards, we


633
0:30:50,53 --> 0:30:53,3
met with the general's
secretary, who meticulously


634
0:30:53,3 --> 0:30:54,76
transcribed our every word.


635
0:30:54,76 --> 0:30:57,19
The general finally granted
us an audience.


636
0:30:57,19 --> 0:30:57,74
We can start?


637
0:30:57,74 --> 0:30:58,11
HOREB BUJAMBO: Yeah.


638
0:30:58,11 --> 0:30:59,71
SUROOSH ALVI: OK, monsieur
le general, thank


639
0:30:59,71 --> 0:31:1,68
you for your time.


640
0:31:1,68 --> 0:31:5,63
My first question is, since
the time of Belgian


641
0:31:5,63 --> 0:31:8,64
colonization, the natural
resources of this country have


642
0:31:8,64 --> 0:31:11,22
been taken from the
Congolese people.


643
0:31:11,22 --> 0:31:17,44
As the protectors of Congolese
soil, what is your view on the


644
0:31:17,44 --> 0:31:20,26
mining that's taken place in
the country and the way


645
0:31:20,26 --> 0:31:22,17
foreign corporations
and governments are


646
0:31:22,17 --> 0:31:23,42
involved with that?


647
0:31:23,42 --> 0:31:25,65

GENERAL JANVIER:

649
0:31:26,9 --> 0:32:4,485



650
0:32:4,485 --> 0:32:6,31
SUROOSH ALVI: It seemed like
Janvier's beef was not with


651
0:32:6,31 --> 0:32:8,18
foreigners in general,
but with the current


652
0:32:8,18 --> 0:32:9,5
government of Rwanda.


653
0:32:9,5 --> 0:32:11,4
So I was starting to understand
why they'd team up


654
0:32:11,4 --> 0:32:12,9
with the FDLR.


655
0:32:12,9 --> 0:32:17,79
It seems to me that you have a
common enemy with the FDLR,


656
0:32:17,79 --> 0:32:19,45
and I'm wondering, are you
friends with them?


657
0:32:19,45 --> 0:32:23,2
And also, do you think that
they should leave this


658
0:32:23,2 --> 0:32:25,19
country, along with the
rest of the Rwandans?

GENERAL JANVIER:

660
0:32:26,94 --> 0:32:33,82



661
0:32:33,82 --> 0:32:35,26
SUROOSH ALVI: Now I was
totally confused.


662
0:32:35,26 --> 0:32:37,88
Were they or weren't they
allied with the FDLR?


663
0:32:37,88 --> 0:32:41,94
The UN group of experts report
that you and your group have


664
0:32:41,94 --> 0:32:46,11
been working with FDLR, and it's
very important for us to


665
0:32:46,11 --> 0:32:47,91
get clarity on this
from you, so we


666
0:32:47,91 --> 0:32:49,87
communicate this report correctly.


667

668
0:32:51,12 --> 0:33:14,8



669
0:33:14,8 --> 0:33:16,36
SUROOSH ALVI: Even though I knew
this was total bullshit,


670
0:33:16,36 --> 0:33:18,96
because it was the FDLR who
escorted us to the Mai Mai


671
0:33:18,96 --> 0:33:21,48
camp, I didn't want to piss
off our new friends, so I


672
0:33:21,48 --> 0:33:22,78
decided to change topics.


673
0:33:22,78 --> 0:33:25,78
Could you explain to me what
some of these special powers


674
0:33:25,78 --> 0:33:27,88
are that the Mai Mai have?

0:33:29,13 --> 0:33:48,59

0:33:48,59 --> 0:33:53,62
SUROOSH ALVI: I am a Muzungu,
but I am not white.


678
0:33:53,62 --> 0:33:56,44
And I believe in God.

0:33:57,69 --> 0:34:23,98



681
0:34:23,98 --> 0:34:25,54
SUROOSH ALVI: So the general
wouldn't show off his magical


682
0:34:25,54 --> 0:34:27,79
powers, but what he did insist
on showing us were his


683
0:34:27,79 --> 0:34:31,7
prisoners, two FARDC soldiers
they kidnapped two months ago


684
0:34:31,7 --> 0:34:32,53
while patrolling the area.


685
0:34:32,53 --> 0:34:35,949
This was a remarkably weird,
unsettling, and Heart of


686
0:34:35,949 --> 0:34:37,3
Darkness moment.


687
0:34:37,3 --> 0:34:40,98
It seems that they're pretty
healthy, and haven't been


688
0:34:40,98 --> 0:34:43,26
abused or beaten.


689
0:34:43,26 --> 0:34:45,15
So why are you being
nice to them?

0:34:46,62 --> 0:34:57,3

SUROOSH ALVI: After the
general served up his


693
0:34:58,16 --> 0:35:0,57
propaganda, he fed us
a nice, hot meal of


694
0:35:0,57 --> 0:35:3,95
Congolese rice and beans.


695
0:35:3,95 --> 0:35:6,1
It's the first meal we've
had in a few days.


696
0:35:6,1 --> 0:35:9,83
We're about to trek through
the jungle.


697
0:35:9,83 --> 0:35:11,756
This time in the middle
of the afternoon, so I


698
0:35:11,756 --> 0:35:13,97
expect it will be hot.


699
0:35:13,97 --> 0:35:15,63
Took us 14 hours to get here.


700
0:35:15,63 --> 0:35:17,9
Hopefully it won't take
that long to get back.


701
0:35:17,9 --> 0:35:20,29



702
0:35:20,29 --> 0:35:21,74
He was a nice guy,
the general.


703
0:35:21,74 --> 0:35:26,61



704
0:35:26,61 --> 0:35:28,9
On our trek back, we
managed to piss off


705
0:35:28,9 --> 0:35:30,84
the creepy FDLR commander.

by our motorcycle guys.


709
0:35:38,66 --> 0:35:39,81
What happened?


710
0:35:39,81 --> 0:35:41,402
JASON MOJICA: Well, they're
holding out for like, a whole


711
0:35:41,402 --> 0:35:42,217
lot more money.


712
0:35:42,217 --> 0:35:46,42
SUROOSH ALVI: The UN guys
are gonna get involved.


713
0:35:46,42 --> 0:35:48,53
And had our lives threatened
by a bunch of locals


714
0:35:48,53 --> 0:35:51,23
drunk on 12% beer.


715
0:35:51,23 --> 0:35:54,53
But the strangest part of it
all was that by this point,


716
0:35:54,53 --> 0:35:57,76
after just one week in the
Congo, all this lunacy seemed


717
0:35:57,76 --> 0:35:59,1
completely normal.


718
0:35:59,1 --> 0:36:6,48



719
0:36:6,48 --> 0:36:7,79
Leaving tomorrow.


720
0:36:7,79 --> 0:36:8,91
The trip has come to an end.


721
0:36:8,91 --> 0:36:12,8
It was good vibes, it
was scary at times.


722
0:36:12,8 --> 0:36:13,62
We learned a lot.


723
0:36:13,62 --> 0:36:17,19
We had to work hard to
get to the story.


724
0:36:17,19 --> 0:36:20,17
Whether we were going to the
mines in Numbi, or whether we


725
0:36:20,17 --> 0:36:22,29
were trying to meet with
General Janvier.


726
0:36:22,29 --> 0:36:26,47
It's an incredibly complicated
situation in place.


727
0:36:26,47 --> 0:36:29,496
There are no easy answers.


728
0:36:29,496 --> 0:36:31,7
But we--


729
0:36:31,7 --> 0:36:31,8
well, how do I end that?


730
0:36:31,8 --> 0:36:33,725
There are no easy answers.


731
0:36:33,725 --> 0:36:36,57
It's easy to pin the country's
problems on the past.


732
0:36:36,57 --> 0:36:39,7
On the legacy of brutality by
Belgian colonialists and


733
0:36:39,7 --> 0:36:42,34
kleptocratic rulers, the
practices of Western


734
0:36:42,34 --> 0:36:45,38
corporations, or wars with
neighboring nations.


735
0:36:45,38 --> 0:36:48,25
But that doesn't make
any of them go away.


736
0:36:48,25 --> 0:36:51,39
If we demanded conflict-free
electronics, maybe the rebel


737
0:36:51,39 --> 0:36:54,22
groups would simply melt
away into the jungle.


738
0:36:54,22 --> 0:36:56,79
Or maybe it would lead to
businesses avoiding coltan


739
0:36:56,79 --> 0:36:59,61
from Congo altogether, making
one of the poorest countries


740
0:36:59,61 --> 0:37:2,48
in the world even poorer, which
is kind of what seems to


741
0:37:2,48 --> 0:37:4,9
be happening.


742
0:37:4,9 --> 0:37:6,38
Congo is one of the most
under-reported stories in the


743
0:37:6,38 --> 0:37:8,6
world, and now we
understand why.


744
0:37:8,6 --> 0:37:10,88
It's so insanely complicated
that's it's hard to


745
0:37:10,88 --> 0:37:12,3
know where to start.


746
0:37:12,3 --> 0:37:15,91
We did, however, see some signs
of hope and progress.


747
0:37:15,91 --> 0:37:18,7
But it's a fragile progress in
a place where anyone with a


748
0:37:18,7 --> 0:37:21,17
gun and an agenda can
basically have


749
0:37:21,17 --> 0:37:23,72
his own little kingdom.


750
0:37:23,72 --> 0:37:26,27
So until the government in
Kinshasa takes control of its


751
0:37:26,27 --> 0:37:29,63
territory and ensures that its
army is the only one operating


752
0:37:29,63 --> 0:37:33,53
in the jungle, Congo will
continue to be a war zone.


753
0:37:33,53 --> 0:37:36,8
And instead of being a blessing,
the minerals that


754
0:37:36,8 --> 0:37:38,516
fuel this conflict will continue
to be a curse.


755
0:37:38,516 --> 0:39:38,516
