###18 SUROOSH ALVI: We're at the Erez crossing, which is where
###20 you enter Gaza from.
###22 So apparently, when you go into Gaza, you have to walk
###26 until you get to the first town there.
###28 And--
###29 [GUNFIRE]
###32 SUROOSH ALVI: And apparently, that walk is
###33 very dangerous, because--
###35 [GUNFIRE]
###37 SUROOSH ALVI: Because you can get shot.
###38 
###40 It's been brothers killing brothers over there, Hamas and
###45 Fatah, fighting over control of the Gaza Strip.
###48 Hamas declared victory.
###50 Hamas is saying, you know, enough with moderation.
###53 It's time to create a proper Islamic state.
###56 
###70 We are driving through the Sinai Peninsula on our way to
###74 the Gaza Strip.
###74 In 2007, we were filming in Israel and we tried to access
###78 the Gaza Strip through the Erez crossing.
###81 We couldn't get in.
###82 It was sealed off.
###83 Four years later, we are now accessing the Gaza Strip
###86 through Egypt, through the Rafah crossing.
###89 After the Egyptian Revolution, the crossing was opened up.
###92 The people wanted to support the Palestinians inside the
###95 Gaza Strip.
###96 They've been under a blockade by air and by sea.
###100 It's been inaccessible, sealed off to the outside world.
###102 So it's finally open now, and we're going to go in and see
###105 what life is like for the people of the Gaza Strip
###108 underneath Hamas rule.
###109 
###114 [HORN HONKING]
###115 
###119 SUROOSH ALVI: Now even though the Rafah crossing is open, it
###122 doesn't make getting in any easier.
###124 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###125 
###127 SUROOSH ALVI: When we got to the entrance, it was a jammed
###130 mess of suitcases and people screaming to get in.
###133 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###134 
###141 SUROOSH ALVI: With our passports and a little bit of
###142 patience, we eventually pushed through the chaos, slipped
###146 through the gate and into the clearing.
###148 
###158 SUROOSH ALVI: After that, we had to go to a holding center
###160 to get checked and vetted again, which ended up taking
###163 about three hours.
###164 The place was packed, but the vibe inside was a bit calmer
###167 and more organized and it was outside.
###170 People seemed genuinely excited to be entering the
###172 Gaza Strip.
###173 MALE SPEAKER 3: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###175 
###190 SUROOSH ALVI: We eventually got put on a bus, drove past
###192 the border marker, and got dropped off in Palestinian
###195 territory on the other side.
###197 The whole bus trip lasted about three minutes, and we
###199 drove the distance of about two football fields.
###201 But we couldn't argue with protocol.
###204 We were finally in the Gaza Strip.
###206 
###210 The drive from the border town of Rafah in the south to Gaza
###213 City in the north is just 25 miles, which gives you an idea
###217 of just how tiny the place is.
###219 According to the UN, more than two-thirds of its 1.6 million
###222 residents are refugees.
###224 Even though Gaza is small, it's a crucial part of
###226 Palestine and completely isolated from the West Bank.
###230 In 2006, Gaza held elections for the first time, and much
###234 of the world was shocked when Hamas, a group that the US and
###237 Europe classify as a terrorist organization, won.
###240 The Bush administration, who had championed elections in
###243 the Arab world, were obviously less than
###245 thrilled with this outcome.
###247 They began working to isolate new Hamas-controlled
###249 government.
###250 In addition to helping impose a blockade that cut off Hamas
###253 from the outside world, they equipped Hamas's rivals,
###256 Fatah, with a raft of new weapons and training in hopes
###259 that they would unseat Hamas from power.
###261 It didn't work.
###264 After a succession of assassinations, kidnappings,
###266 and street battles between Hamas and Fatah, Hamas took
###269 complete control of the Gaza Strip and, for the first time
###272 in its history, had to figure out how to run a government.
###276 MALE SPEAKER 4: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ON
###276 LOUDSPEAKER]
###278 In the days before we arrived, militant groups inside Gaza
###281 had been launching rockets into Israel, and the Israelis
###284 responded by launching attacks on what they
###286 called terror cells.
###287 When we got to our hotel, we could see Israeli drones
###290 flying around everywhere.
###293 Kind of screwed up our plan--
###294 doing a story on Gaza without ever mentioning Israel.
###298 The constant buzzing of drones overhead made us super
###300 paranoid that anything place we went
###302 could be blown to bits.
###303 Like the Hamas government building where we met with the
###305 group's spokesman, Fawzi Barhoum.
###307 
###310 SUROOSH ALVI: Can you explain to me why there were rockets
###313 being launched into Israel and why Israel was bombing Gaza
###317 over the last few days?
###318 Why did the cease-fire break down?
###320 
###337 SUROOSH ALVI: Who attacked first?
###339 
###342 SUROOSH ALVI: Israel attacked?
###343 
###351 SUROOSH ALVI: Islamic Jihad is a group that--
###354 it's more radical, I think, than Hamas.
###357 
###389 SUROOSH ALVI: The resistance against Israel is part of the
###391 fabric of everyday life in Gaza, so when a militant group
###395 like Al-Ansar decides to have a pop-up press conference in
###398 the middle of a busy street, nobody bats an
###400 eye, except for us.
###403 Holy shit.
###405 MALE SPEAKER 5: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###406 
###475 SUROOSH ALVI: And like that, they were gone.
###479 It was a hell of a first day in the Gaza Strip.
###482 
###501 [HORN HONKING]
###503 SUROOSH ALVI: We're going on patrol with the
###505 Hamas police force.
###505 Apparently, there's some kind of fight going on.
###508 We're going to see who's kicking whose ass.
###513 After the 2007 battle with rival Palestinian faction,
###516 Fatah, Hamas came out on top, which meant most Fatah
###519 supporters got the hell out of Gaza.
###521 So we were surprised when the police rolled up to an entire
###524 Fatah neighborhood.
###526 We seem to be in Fatah-controlled
###529 territory right now.
###530 Their flags are flying everywhere.
###532 And I'm not sure why we're here or what the police are
###536 investigating.
###538 MALE SPEAKER 6: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###539 
###556 SUROOSH ALVI: What they seem to be investigating with this
###558 full-on show of force was a minor building code violation.
###562 MALE SPEAKER 6: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###564 
###568 SUROOSH ALVI: Hamas has a reputation for imposing a
###570 strict rule of law.
###571 MALE SPEAKER 6: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###573 SUROOSH ALVI: Even more so if you're a member of Fatah.
###575 So basically, Hamas was just harassing Fatah supporters.
###580 SAMAH AHMED: All Fatah members here in
###582 Gaza cannot to anything.
###584 The situation controlled by Hamas.
###586 She's the government and she's the security.
###589 She's everything.
###590 It's not easy to have your normal daily life with Hamas.
###594 If the security of Hamas came to any restaurant, any opening
###599 places, and find boys and girls sitting together, they
###603 start to ask about the kind of the relationship between you,
###607 if it's legal or not.
###610 Sometimes I feel that they occupied my mind.
###613 I didn't want to say that Fatah is the best.
###615 They have many faults.
###617 They do many mistakes.
###619 But at least they are better than Hamas.
###623 SUROOSH ALVI: Hamas viewed the Fatah-run Palestinian
###625 Authority in the West Bank as an inherently corrupt entity
###628 that failed to provide basic services for Gazans and looked
###632 the other way when it came to alcohol and drugs.
###635 Much of Hamas's popularity comes from the fact that they
###637 are seen as honest and incorruptible.
###640 And when they took power, they put a concerted effort into
###643 stomping out all forms of vice in Gaza.
###646 But the same tunnels that allow Hamas to smuggle in
###648 weapons from Egypt also allow for a steady flow of drugs.
###653 SAMAH AHMED: They're children working in the tunnel.
###656 They are 12, 13.
###658 They are smoking and taking drugs.
###661 Through the tunnels, many kind of drugs can enter to Gaza,
###664 because there is no control on the tunnels.
###667 
###670 SUROOSH ALVI: So because there's no control in the
###671 tunnels, Hamas are constantly doing drug raids around Gaza.
###675 MALE SPEAKER ON RADIO: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###677 
###688 SUROOSH ALVI: And they round up all kinds of drugs in all
###691 shapes and sizes.
###692 
###698 SUROOSH ALVI: Cocaine balls.
###700 
###707 MALE SPEAKER 6: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###708 
###711 SUROOSH ALVI: It's cocaine in perfectly formed triangles,
###716 which is odd.
###718 Lot of little bricks of hash and pills.
###720 
###723 SUROOSH ALVI: That's 100 grams?
###725 MALE SPEAKER 6: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###728 MALE SPEAKER 7: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###730 SUROOSH ALVI: Now things like hash and cocaine are pretty
###732 standard for a drug raid.
###735 But the biggest drug problem in Gaza is Tramodol, or as
###738 it's called there, Tramol.
###740 Tramol is a prescription painkiller that has become the
###742 drug of choice for young people looking to escape the
###745 reality of life in Gaza.
###747 MALE SPEAKER 6: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###748 
###752 SUROOSH ALVI: And where is it all coming from?
###753 Is ti coming from Egypt?
###754 MALE SPEAKER 6: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###756 SUROOSH ALVI: Through the tunnels?
###757 MALE SPEAKER 6: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###758 
###770 SUROOSH ALVI: We decided to see if we could find some kids
###772 to talk to who might be using Tramol.
###774 Our fixer, Raed, said he knew just the place to go.
###777 RAED: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###778 
###789 SUROOSH ALVI: We are now hunting for kids on drugs, and
###792 we figured a park is a good place to go.
###795 In my experience, parks are great places for stoned kids
###799 to hang out.
###800 The psychological impact of living under occupation in a
###803 place that's sealed off is really heavy.
###805 They're poor, they don't have jobs, they've lost their
###808 family members to war.
###810 They're turning to drugs.
###811 They're numbing the pain.
###813 They're trying to find a way to escape, and the only way
###814 they can do that is through pharmaceuticals.
###818 We spotted some kids hanging out in the corner of the park
###820 and walked over to them.
###822 I let Raed do the talking.
###824 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###836 SUROOSH ALVI: Really?
###837 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###838 
###873 SUROOSH ALVI: They don't care.
###874 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###875 
###881 SUROOSH ALVI: So according to these kids, Tramol became more
###884 popular after Hamas came to power, and its reach is still
###887 spreading, in spite of all the crackdowns and in spite of the
###890 harsh punishments suffered by people who got caught.
###893 People who we would be meeting the next day.
###895 
###913 [MUEZZIN GIVING CALL TO PRAYER OVER LOUDSPEAKER]
###915 
###935 SUROOSH ALVI: After seeing the Hamas police squad show off
###937 all the drugs they've confiscated in raids across
###939 the Gaza Strip, we wanted to see what happens to the people
###942 they catch.
###943 Gaza City's central prison is home to both drug smugglers
###946 and drug users.
###948 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###949 
###967 
###975 SUROOSH ALVI: We read that drugs are a big problem.
###978 For the crime of smuggling drugs, or smoking hash, or
###983 adultery, what are the punishments?
###985 
###991 SUROOSH ALVI: And how do they execute people?
###993 They hang them?
###994 
###999 SUROOSH ALVI: Shooting.
###999 Wow.
###1000 Heavy.
###1001 
###1006 SUROOSH ALVI: It's all drugs?
###1007 And how many prisoners are in this room here?
###1012 SUROOSH ALVI: 36?
###1012 In this one room?
###1014 
###1020 SUROOSH ALVI: He's a good man?
###1022 SUROOSH ALVI: Why does he like you so much?
###1026 SUROOSH ALVI: Right, right.
###1027 That's why he's being nice now.
###1028 
###1038 SUROOSH ALVI: How do you know that they will
###1039 come back after Eid?
###1040 
###1050 SUROOSH ALVI: Put the whole family in jail.
###1052 
###1059 SUROOSH ALVI: Anyone ever escape from here?
###1061 
###1074 SUROOSH ALVI: OK.
###1075 
###1085 SUROOSH ALVI: How many women are in the prison?
###1089 SUROOSH ALVI: That's all?
###1090 
###1093 SUROOSH ALVI: In all of Gaza?
###1094 JAMILA AL-SHANTI: Yes.
###1094 SUROOSH ALVI: And what are the crimes that
###1096 they're in prison for?
###1098 
###1102 SUROOSH ALVI: Right.
###1104 [MUEZZIN GIVING CALL TO PRAYER OVER LOUDSPEAKER]
###1106 
###1115 SUROOSH ALVI: Rather than letting us visit the women in
###1116 their cells, the women's warden dragged the female
###1119 prisoners out and put them on display for us in a room that
###1121 they apparently use to make prisoner arts and crafts.
###1125 [MEOW]
###1126 SUROOSH ALVI: It's a bit of a PR show.
###1127 They're giving them, you know, like warm
###1129 clothes for the winter.
###1130 Basically, it's--
###1132 it's odd.
###1133 It's a bit weird.
###1135 She's the boss.
###1137 FEMALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1138 
###1159 SUROOSH ALVI: We weren't allowed to interview the women
###1160 on camera, so we had Raed find out what these women had done
###1163 to end up behind bars.
###1166 This woman here is in jail for two years because she helped
###1171 her son escape and get out of Gaza Strip illegally, to go to
###1176 Israel or the West Bank.
###1177 I'm not sure where he went.
###1178 And she was smiling and was actually saying it with pride,
###1181 which was interesting.
###1183 The woman who had the little boy out of wedlock, she is in
###1186 jail or six years for that crime.
###1190 For having a kid illegitimately.
###1191 
###1194 
###1218 SUROOSH ALVI: That's interesting.
###1219 So basically what you're saying is that Hamas is very
###1222 progressive when it comes to women's rights.
###1225 
###1233 SAMAH AHMED: Actually, it's a complicated life for the women
###1237 and also for all the Palestinians.
###1239 But especially for the women, the girls, you cannot do
###1243 whatever you want.
###1245 It's not easy, actually.
###1246 
###1251 SUROOSH ALVI: Just to be clear about this, women's rights now
###1255 compared to five years ago, how is it different?
###1258 SAMAH AHMED: The wife cannot go to the police station if
###1262 she getting beated from her husband.
###1265 Before, you can go to the police station.
###1267 SUROOSH ALVI: Right.
###1268 SAMAH AHMED: And the police station told the woman, just
###1270 go and solve your problem with your husband.
###1273 
###1277 I wish that Hamas didn't win the election.
###1281 I have many good memories with Hamas members.
###1284 We have been like brothers and sisters.
###1287 But when they get the power, they changed.
###1289 
###1294 Gaza became another country.
###1296 It's not anymore a part of Palestine.
###1299 
###1340 SUROOSH ALVI: We're at the Hamas police
###1341 station in Gaza City.
###1342 These are unexploded bombs, and the police just told us
###1345 that they found a bomb in Khan Yunis, a town nearby, and
###1349 they've asked us if we want to go with them and watch them
###1352 blow the bomb up.
###1353 And we said yes.
###1354 
###1357 The bomb squad grounds were overflowing with tons of
###1360 unexploded ordnance, including the infamous Qassam rocket,
###1363 which was developed by the military arm of Hamas.
###1367 MALE SPEAKER 8: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1368 
###1373 SUROOSH ALVI: We're looking at a Qassam rocket.
###1375 It is made in a secret underground
###1377 factory here in Gaza.
###1379 It's not very accurate.
###1380 It has a range of eight kilometers.
###1383 Often not very effective.
###1384 Some Palestinians think it's more trouble than it's worth.
###1387 But it has created a lot of problems for Israel, and has
###1391 them living in fear in the southern cities
###1393 of Ashdod and Ashkelon.
###1394 
###1399 So these are all the unexploded bombs.
###1403 Grenades in here.
###1404 Mortar shells, a lot of them.
###1406 Bit freaky in here.
###1408 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1410 
###1415 SUROOSH ALVI: Just as we were looking at all the weapons in
###1417 the truck, everyone started freaking out and pointing up
###1419 at the sky.
###1420 It turned out that what we had witnessed was Israel's test of
###1423 a new long-range missile capable of hitting Iran.
###1426 We were happy it wasn't going to come down on our heads in
###1428 Gaza, but it was a potent reminder of the strength of
###1431 Israel's military.
###1433 It feels like everyone was anticipating
###1435 something to happen.
###1437 Israel's been saying for the last couple days these
###1439 cryptic, veiled threats.
###1440 They're going to go in and solve this problem once and
###1443 for all in Gaza.
###1444 What does that mean?
###1445 
###1449 Now that we were all completely paranoid, we headed
###1452 off into the desert with our truck full of bombs.
###1457 We're riding along here behind a rolling bomb, essentially.
###1460 The truck is full of unexploded ordnance.
###1462 We have grenades, landmines, mortars, rockets.
###1466 They're loose, bouncing around in the back of the truck.
###1469 We're driving through crowded urban areas.
###1472 We just passed a school.
###1473 It doesn't seem like they're taking a lot of precautions,
###1476 but it hasn't blown up yet.
###1477 
###1487 Come on, man.
###1489 What are you doing?
###1490 Fuck!
###1492 No, that's good.
###1493 I'm good.
###1495 All right, you having fun now?
###1496 You enjoying yourselves?
###1499 We are on a former Israeli settlement.
###1501 It's the only place in Gaza with enough open area where
###1505 you can blow something up without someone
###1507 getting killed or hurt.
###1509 I can't help but point out the irony of blowing up Israeli
###1513 bombs that were left here where Israeli
###1516 settlers used to live.
###1517 Makes us nervous.
###1518 You know, like, I don't know that one of these things isn't
###1520 going to go off.
###1521 They're just dumping it off the truck, dropping things.
###1523 Shouldn't they be exploding?
###1526 All right.
###1526 I--
###1527 I'm done.
###1528 
###1542 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1544 
###1576 SUROOSH ALVI: This is the final stage.
###1578 We've left two cameras, one right by the pit of bombs and
###1582 the other one up on the hill.
###1583 Hopefully they don't get blown up.
###1585 We're trying to convince George, our cameraman-- that's
###1587 you-- to stay here and get a better shot.
###1590 But he doesn't seem to be too into that.
###1592 Our producer Jason courageously and/or stupidly
###1596 volunteered to go film in the bunker.
###1598 
###1602 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1603 
###1642 SUROOSH ALVI: Feels a little chaotic.
###1644 Apparently, they're having some technical problems now.
###1646 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1647 
###1651 SUROOSH ALVI: I'm more worried about Jason inside of that
###1653 doghouse bunker that he's in.
###1655 MALE SPEAKER 9: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1657 
###1660 SUROOSH ALVI: No?
###1660 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1662 
###1665 SUROOSH ALVI: They're telling us to get down.
###1667 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING ARABIC]

###1688 
###1701 [SIREN]
###1706 
###1710 SUROOSH ALVI: Behind me is the crater.
###1712 It was done successfully, although it took a while.
###1714 It didn't detonate the first couple times.
###1717 And as we were sitting around waiting, I thought about this
###1719 morning when the Israelis launched a super high-tech
###1722 missile And then meanwhile, 20 kilometers over.
###1725 It's like a cartoon.
###1726 Not particularly calculated and kind of chaotic.
###1729 Maybe that sums up life in Gaza Strip.
###1731 
###1752 We're doing some shopping right now.
###1754 Got some--
###1755 some swag.
###1757 Al-Qassam.
###1758 MALE SPEAKER 10: Yeah, Hamas.
###1759 SUROOSH ALVI: Hamas Military Brigade.
###1761 
###1765 SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah, why?
###1765 The drone?
###1766 MALE SPEAKER 10: Yeah, of course.
###1766 SUROOSH ALVI: Will it get me?
###1769 SUROOSH ALVI: I'm not worried.
###1771 I'm not wearing the right shirt, though.
###1772 Like a button-down shirt with my Islamic Jihad headband?
###1775 Doesn't really work.
###1777 I'm going to keep it on.
###1778 I'll go shopping with it.
###1780 I'm kidding.
###1782 All right, we'll take those also.
###1785 Just as we were getting into the groove of things in Gaza
###1787 and were starting to relax, we found out that the border
###1790 crossing was closing unexpectedly.
###1791 RAED: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1794 SUROOSH ALVI: Raed got on the phone to try and convince them
###1796 to keep the crossing open long enough for us to
###1799 get back into Egypt.
###1801 We are trying to get to the border now, to Rafah crossing.
###1803 If we don't make it there before noon, then we might be
###1806 stuck in Gaza, in which case, we'll have to
###1809 go through the tunnels.
###1811 Samah decided to hitch a ride with us, hoping that she might
###1813 slip through in the chaos.
###1815 
###1820 So if you get through today, that's a pretty big deal.
###1824 Means that you're maybe not being targeted anymore, or--?
###1828 
###1859 RAED: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1860 
###1875 SUROOSH ALVI: In spite of Samah having a visa to travel
###1877 to Germany, the Hamas border guards weren't having it.
###1880 And we were rushed along without her, leaving her
###1883 behind the walls of the Gaza Strip.
###1885 RAED: [SPEAKING ARABIC]
###1886 
###1896 SUROOSH ALVI: After our first try to get into Gaza in 2007,
###1900 it took us years to finally get in.
###1902 In reality, if Israel hadn't made it so hard to get in in
###1905 the first place, I don't think we would have been so curious
###1907 about what was going on behind those walls.
###1909 
###1912 When we first arrived, we were really impressed by this kind
###1914 of orderliness that you don't see in many places that are as
###1917 poor as Gaza.
###1919 But then as we began to realize that this was purely
###1921 the result of Hamas's authoritarian approach to law
###1924 and order, it began to creep us out.
###1926 MALE SPEAKER 11: [ARABIC]
###1928 SUROOSH ALVI: The Hamas government operates in an
