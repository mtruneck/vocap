1
0:0:3,0 --> 0:0:12,53
The science of communication does not exist
actually, there is no science of communication


2
0:0:12,53 --> 0:0:23,39
as of yet, although to a limitted extent,
we do communicate, but communication is misunderstood.


3
0:0:23,39 --> 0:0:34,94
For example, if a price desires a particular
woman, he may send her a gift, the expense


4
0:0:34,94 --> 0:0:44,35
of that gift determines to what extent that
women will yeild to the prince, so that's


5
0:0:44,35 --> 0:0:52,45
a form of communication. You ask an ordinary
man to repair your roof, he might say "no".


6
0:0:52,45 --> 0:1:0,629
If you offer him 20 dollars an hour, he might
say maybe. If you offer him 30 dollars an


7
0:1:0,629 --> 0:1:8,7
hour, he says "when do you want me to start?"
So money can be a mechanism that affects human


8
0:1:8,7 --> 0:1:18,74
behavior. Ultimately, communication was a
means of trying to affect human behavior.


9
0:1:18,74 --> 0:1:26,86
A woman that can operate a sawing machine
quite well can not communicate with a physiologist.


10
0:1:26,86 --> 0:1:37,189
Only to a limitted extent. So communication,
in the society where there are multiplicity


11
0:1:37,189 --> 0:1:45,13
of different reactions and different values,
does not assure communication. You understand


12
0:1:45,13 --> 0:1:55,86
what that means? You have problems with that?
Ok. So, if a man is very good with a bow and


13
0:1:55,86 --> 0:2:3,2
arrow, in order to serve his tribe, he might
train others to use the bow and arrow efficiently.


14
0:2:3,2 --> 0:2:13,62
Now when people fly an airplane today, they
try to aim the missile at an airplane. If


15
0:2:13,62 --> 0:2:20,31
someone designs a heat seeking missile, that
goes up the hot end of an airplane, or the


16
0:2:20,31 --> 0:2:30,3
exhaust port, they don't need to aim or develop
a training program for that. You merely release


17
0:2:30,3 --> 0:2:38,45
the missile and it seeks heat. If you released
a missile and it seeked the human body, you


18
0:2:38,45 --> 0:2:46,29
don't need to train people to aim. So communication,
to a limitted extent, has to do with the state


19
0:2:46,29 --> 0:2:55,879
of technology today. Do you understand? Communication
as a system, is always undergoing change.


20
0:2:55,879 --> 0:3:4,12
Now if you sit there and say "well what is
communication?" well in essense, you want


21
0:3:4,12 --> 0:3:11,59
control the behavior of another person. That's
what you say "I'll see ya Wednesday" Wednesday


22
0:3:11,59 --> 0:3:17,59
means the same thing to the other person,
but if it's a forgeiner he says "what means


23
0:3:17,59 --> 0:3:25,83
Wednesday?" So you have to find out what that
means. So when people set out to communicate,


24
0:3:25,83 --> 0:3:36,8
they set out to share language, and that all
depends on what the rewards are, for a certain


25
0:3:36,8 --> 0:3:42,49
behavior. If you have a certain philosophy,
and you're a ruler of a certain country, and


26
0:3:42,49 --> 0:3:51,239
someone offers you 2 million dollars, you
may sell your country short, if they deposit


27
0:3:51,239 --> 0:3:55,25
2 million in the bank, so the 2 million dollars
is a method of persuasion, or communication.


28
0:3:55,25 --> 0:4:4,459
Do you understand that? That's why it's not
possible, in a monetary system, where there


29
0:4:4,459 --> 0:4:14,54
are certain ways of gaining advantage. If
the communication takes away your advantage,


30
0:4:14,54 --> 0:4:20,299
there's no need for you to learn that kind
of communication. If you're head of the Catholic


31
0:4:20,299 --> 0:4:26,97
church and the Presperterian church becomes
dominant in your community, there's no basis


32
0:4:26,97 --> 0:4:35,18
for you learning about that, because it takes
away your job. So in a monetary system where


33
0:4:35,18 --> 0:4:43,5
rewards vary, it's very difficult to establish
communication. That's why people that come


34
0:4:43,5 --> 0:4:50,58
from different cultures, can not communicate,
except to a limitted extent. If one Indian


35
0:4:50,58 --> 0:4:57,84
tribe has a different philosophy than another,
the may not want to communicate, cause it


36
0:4:57,84 --> 0:5:6,699
may upset the conduct of people in the tribe,
but if a common enemy appears, then the tribes


37
0:5:6,699 --> 0:5:15,289
might merge temporarily, to defeat the common
enemy, but they don't sit down and communicate.


38
0:5:15,289 --> 0:5:21,55
They communicate - their communication is
maintaining positions of differential advantage.


39
0:5:21,55 --> 0:5:30,15
They do not seek to communicate, they seek
to maintain those positions. Now there's many


40
0:5:30,15 --> 0:5:37,99
scientists that say "yes, we're interested
in developing a means of communication" but


41
0:5:37,99 --> 0:5:48,56
even scientists have vested interest, so their
communication is affected by vested interest.


42
0:5:48,56 --> 0:5:56,419
Nobodies so pure as to say, "I seek pure communication"
you'd have to forget all about your culture,


43
0:5:56,419 --> 0:6:5,18
advantages and living in a nice house making
money, all of that would interfere, but if


44
0:6:5,18 --> 0:6:12,58
you wish to communicate with another person,
you either set out advantages - in other words


45
0:6:12,58 --> 0:6:18,539
you bring the other person gifts, then they
say "what have you to say?" If you come at


46
0:6:18,539 --> 0:6:23,93
them and say "we're taking your land away,
cause we can operate your land more efficiently


47
0:6:23,93 --> 0:6:33,3
than you can" they don't say "great, do that"
they have vested interest, and they maintain


48
0:6:33,3 --> 0:6:38,229
their vested interest, that's why you can
communicate on the nature of the plannets,


49
0:6:38,229 --> 0:6:44,22
and people will listen to you, it doesn't
affect their income, their style of living,


50
0:6:44,22 --> 0:6:50,0
or their values. If you tell them that the
moon always faces the earth as it goes around,


51
0:6:50,0 --> 0:6:56,38
they're willing to listen to that, but if
you tell them things that interfere with their


52
0:6:56,38 --> 0:7:4,8
positions of differential advantage, communication
fails, that is there's no such thing. Am I


53
0:7:4,8 --> 0:7:12,479
clear up to now? This is why people, can only
communicate in areas where they have common


54
0:7:12,479 --> 0:7:21,99
values, and common sense of gain, in learning
to communicate. If you learned to communicate


55
0:7:21,99 --> 0:7:27,13
with very primitive people, you might be able
to talk to them, but it's no real advantage


56
0:7:27,13 --> 0:7:33,8
to you if you're technical, to communicate
to primitive people, unless you're doing a


57
0:7:33,8 --> 0:7:42,63
autobiography of some particular cheif. So
I would say, in the future, all primitive


58
0:7:42,63 --> 0:7:51,4
people would be updated, not treated as an
anthropology study. Anthropology will be considered


59
0:7:51,4 --> 0:7:59,599
socially offensive behavior. If you go to
a primitive tribe and make notes of how they


60
0:7:59,599 --> 0:8:5,8
behave and what they talk to the trees about,
would not be the propper study of mankind.


61
0:8:5,8 --> 0:8:11,289
The propper study would be the conditions
they live under and their limitted communications.


62
0:8:11,289 --> 0:8:19,0
You would have nothing to say to a seminal
Indian, of extensionality of you, you might


63
0:8:19,0 --> 0:8:25,31
be able to extend the Indian a little bit,
but he can't say anything that would help


64
0:8:25,31 --> 0:8:33,169
you. That's why I point out, it wouldn't make
much sense for you to talk to children, because


65
0:8:33,169 --> 0:8:38,839
they can't say anything new. If they're 10
years old, say "my daddy has a bigger car


66
0:8:38,839 --> 0:8:47,48
than your daddy" - they can't say "the engine
of a Mercedes displaces so many cubic inches,


67
0:8:47,48 --> 0:8:54,45
therefore it's more efficient." They can't
about those things, unless they have wrote


68
0:8:54,45 --> 0:9:3,72
memory, with unreal or no real understanding
of what they're saying. So when you say "is


69
0:9:3,72 --> 0:9:12,3
it possible to develop a science of communication?"
I would say no, not within established systems.


70
0:9:12,3 --> 0:9:21,7
If a system's established, it automatically
cuts communication. Now, if you visit people


71
0:9:21,7 --> 0:9:27,93
from another planet, that have achieved, most
 - and have solved most of the problems we


72
0:9:27,93 --> 0:9:33,56
had here, there's a reason for you to learn
their language, there's a real advantage,


73
0:9:33,56 --> 0:9:41,97
in learning their language, if they've overcome
cancer, heart desease, most nervous disorders,


74
0:9:41,97 --> 0:9:47,839
there's a reason for you to listen. But some
people have such a damaged ego, they can't


75
0:9:47,839 --> 0:9:54,92
even hear things that would serve as an advantage
to them, they really can't hear it, he may


76
0:9:54,92 --> 0:10:0,459
say "well they don't wanna hear it, cause
they feel they've achieved a level advantage,


77
0:10:0,459 --> 0:10:8,94
and who are they to listen to other people?"
You know you've got ego problems, so let me


78
0:10:8,94 --> 0:10:17,579
say this, in order for us to communicate we
have to establish what communication is! If


79
0:10:17,579 --> 0:10:24,12
we don't establish what that is, and we can't
at our present state of development. Say "what


80
0:10:24,12 --> 0:10:31,959
is communication?" without using a referent
of our own values, so I'm using this term,


81
0:10:31,959 --> 0:10:40,39
it is impossible to communicate with other
people today, unless you teach them your language,


82
0:10:40,39 --> 0:10:49,76
your referants, and they accept them, then
you might be able to communicate within the


83
0:10:49,76 --> 0:10:57,5
referants you have given others. So there's
no reason right today, for republicans and


84
0:10:57,5 --> 0:11:4,6
democrats to communicate because there's one
system that offers advantages. Nobody is interested


85
0:11:4,6 --> 0:11:11,1
in long term advantages. If I say there's
an advantage to your culture 50 years from


86
0:11:11,1 --> 0:11:18,31
now, he says "what will serve now?" So that's
what he wants to learn, the advantages of


87
0:11:18,31 --> 0:11:23,4
the immediate. If I say 500 years from now,
people will live perfectly well, nobodies


88
0:11:23,4 --> 0:11:34,149
interested, because there's no communication
of value, that they can receive. So, if scientists,


89
0:11:34,149 --> 0:11:41,42
really were able to - which is almost impossible
 - to let go of everything they have and ask


90
0:11:41,42 --> 0:11:49,88
what is communication? They can't ask that
question. Do you understand? Ok. So when you


91
0:11:49,88 --> 0:11:56,87
effectively communicate with another person,
you either are training them in some way so


92
0:11:56,87 --> 0:12:5,68
that you can - your words would have similar
meaning, not subject to interpretation. If


93
0:12:5,68 --> 0:12:12,16
a person develops even a hearing aid, and
it works better than another one, he has to


94
0:12:12,16 --> 0:12:17,98
communicate the means of making that work
better. Now why does he want it to work better?


95
0:12:17,98 --> 0:12:23,23
Because he gets more money for it. If he doesn't
get more money for it, he doesn't concern


96
0:12:23,23 --> 0:12:29,4
himself with it. So there can't be a science
of communication, where there's a system of


97
0:12:29,4 --> 0:12:35,98
differential advantage. So it's much easier
to give a young girl a gift, and she says


98
0:12:35,98 --> 0:12:42,41
"oh, I'm so impressed by the expense of gift
you gave me" what you're doing is softening


99
0:12:42,41 --> 0:12:50,3
her up, toward your value system. She has
no fixed value system, if that occurs. If


100
0:12:50,3 --> 0:12:57,54
a person has a fixed value system, like religion
which is rigid and fixed, they're not interested


101
0:12:57,54 --> 0:13:4,529
in any kind of communication which takes that
away, cause the project a lot of meaning into


102
0:13:4,529 --> 0:13:12,43
that, and you say "their communication is
ineffective" they don't give a damn. It does


103
0:13:12,43 --> 0:13:19,899
not communicate what you have in mind. So,
first of all, before you even talk about communication,


104
0:13:19,899 --> 0:13:27,639
you have to convince people that they tend
to move along established lines, cause they


105
0:13:27,639 --> 0:13:35,8
have proven to be worth while, within a given
culture. Do you understand what I'm saying?


106
0:13:35,8 --> 0:13:42,47
I'm leaving out sunny day in May, I'm going
right to the point. So if you sit down and


107
0:13:42,47 --> 0:13:49,17
you wanna communicate with another person,
first ask them, why they wanna listen to you,


108
0:13:49,17 --> 0:13:59,4
because it serves no immediate value. Unless
they're studying communication. Now, the science


109
0:13:59,4 --> 0:14:5,5
of communication today, would be within a
given field. If you learn mathematics you


110
0:14:5,5 --> 0:14:13,389
can get jobs doing certain things. So people
do not study to improve communication, they


111
0:14:13,389 --> 0:14:21,11
study to pick up advantage to advantage to
this system. Is that clear? They do not study


112
0:14:21,11 --> 0:14:28,89
to improve communication, even though a person
says "I'm a student of the language of communication"


113
0:14:28,89 --> 0:14:33,889
they can't be that, and be a member of society.
Do you understand that? If a person comes


114
0:14:33,889 --> 0:14:41,37
up to you and says "I'm completely neutral,
I've come to study communication" that is


115
0:14:41,37 --> 0:14:48,72
not possible. Do you understand why? No one
can be completely neutral, you're always a


116
0:14:48,72 --> 0:16:48,72
victim of culture.
