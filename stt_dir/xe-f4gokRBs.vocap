###0 Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. Today we're gonna do awesome science with
###4 Orbix Hot Glass here at Lookout Mountain Alabama. Goggle up.
###8 Science is about to happen. We're gonna use a high speed camera and learn about Prince Rupert's Drop.
###12 [whispers] It's never been done on the internet. You're gonna learn something.
###16 Let's go.
###18 
###22 OK we are here inside the shop with
###24 Cal. Cal owns the place. Can you show me how to make a Prince Rupert's Drop?
###28 (Cal) Sure. I'm gonna gather some glass, drop it in a bucket of
###32 cold water.
###34 
###36 [sizzling sound]
###41 (Destin) So after it cools down, this is what you're left with.
###44 It kinda looks like a tadpole, but it has some really interesting mechanical properties.
###48 We can actually hit this thing with a hammer and it won't break.
###52 OK I'm ready. [bang] Didn't go.
###56 OK I think Cal is kind of a pansy so I.. You think you can break it? [laugh]
###60 So we're gonna try again only this time I'm gonna make him hit it really hard
###64 and I'm gonna record it with high speed. Does that work? Think you can break it? Alright. Let's do it.
###68 The challenge is on. (Cal) Just hit it? - Yep.
###72 [bang] [shattering] [laughs] So do you think you actually broke it? I don't think
###76 you did. You think you broke it? - I know I broke it. [laugh]
###80 - Let's look at the high speed.
###84 [music]
###86 
###88 OK so the drop broke, but technically it wasn't the
###92 hammer that broke it. If you look close in the high speed you can see that it's the wiggling of the
###96 tail that makes it go. This is the mystery of the
###100 Prince Rupert's Drop. You can try
###104 as hard as you can to break the bulb, but you can't.
###108 But, if you even nick the tail, the entire thing will explode. Not shatter,
###112 but actually explode. Let's go outside and I'll show you more.
###116 OK we're gonna just run an obscene frame rate here. We have this
###120 Phantom V1610. So, glass breaking occurs
###124 so fast that you have to have like hundreds of thousands of frames per second, so we're gonna
###128 have a lower resolution and we have to have a lot of light as well. We're also gonna use this Miro over
###132 here to run about 3000 frames per second so we can get a wide shot to see the whole event.
###136 as well. 3..2..1.. go.

###176 OK now we understand what a Prince Rupert Drop does, but at this point
###180 we don't quite understand why it does it. Let's take a closer look.
###184 OK this is called a polariscope and basically what it is is it's a filtered piece of
###188 glass that's polarized. I have another filter here. You can see if I turn it,
###192 then I can block out the light. Now if I put this on the camera
###196 that you're looking through here, and then I put the Prince Rupert's Drop in between
###200 the two pieces of glass, you should be able to see the internal stresses built up
###204 inside the Prince Rupert's Drop. So to understand how these stresses got here, let's
###208 use the color grey to represent nice and strong solid glass. We use red
###212 to represent molten glass and because of the thermal expansion coefficient it's safe to assume that the
###216 higher the temperature the larger this glass wants to be. Blue represents glass that's cooling
###220 off, or transitioning between the two states. Because of that same thermal expansion coefficient
###224 this glass is shrinking and basically pulling in on itself. Think of a
###228 Prince Rupert's Drop as a bunch of little infantessimal pieces of glass with each piece trying to interact
###232 with the pieces around it. When the molten glass is first dripped into the water, the
###236 outside layer touches the water and immediately solidifies. This locks in that
###240 outside shape of the drop. The inside of the drop however is still a hot expanded
###244 liquid. As heat's transferred to the water that glass on the inside slowly begins to
###248 cool down, and pulls in against that outside layer. The problem is that
###252 because it's already locked in as a round solid, it only compresses tighter against
###256 itself. This actually makes it stronger. Kind of like how an arch compresses and gets stronger when
###260 you put your weight on it only this is in all directions. And because the cooling glass can't
###264 move that outside layer it begins to pull against itself, causing it to be
###268 in extremely high tension. It then hardens in this state of tension and there you have it, a
###272 Prince Rupert's Drop. The outside is in extremely high compressive stress and the inside is in
###276 extremely high tensile stress. If one link in this tension chain is ever cut, it
###280 breaks on down the line, feeding off of its own stored up energy just like a chemical
###284 explosive does. The difference here is that instead of releasing chemical potential energy
###288 mechanical strain energy is released. This wave of energy is what we call a
###292 failure front. You can directly measure the velocity of that failure front as long as
###296 you have a camera fast enough. Let's give it a shot at 130,000 frames
###300 per second. 3..2..1..go.
###304 Got it?

###344 interesting and you want to support him by buying stuff go click on the link, wherever I
###348 put it, and go check out his web site. Click the cat to subscribe.
###352 With the helmet. [laugh] It's a sad looking cat.
###356 You've never caught the cat on fire, ever? - Never. - Not even once?
###360 - Never. - These things are named for a guy named Prince Rupert, imagine that,
###364 who lived in Bavaria back in the 1600s. Here, here.
###368 [shins banging on concrete laughter through pain]
###372 He brought these over as a gift to King Charles II in England who gave them to his
###376 Royal Society to try to figure out. Yep ready. [clang]
###380 Holy smokes!
###382 
###384 - Aah the tension's killing me. [shatter] -(Destin in background) NO DON'T BLOW UP!
###388 - You know it blow.. blowed up? - Yep, it blowed up.
###392 - It BLOWED UP Y'ALL! [laugh]

###395 Captioning in different languages welcome. Please contact Destin if you can help.
