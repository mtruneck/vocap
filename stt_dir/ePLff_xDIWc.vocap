###13 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Jumping right in today with something that hasn`t happened in nearly
###16 600 years: the pope is resigning. Pope Benedict XVI made the announcement yesterday. He said
###23 the reason is his "advanced age". He`ll turn 86 in April. He will officially resign at
###29 the end of this month. There are three parts of the story we want to look at. First, popes
###34 in general. The title comes from the Latin word for father, and the tradition goes back
###38 nearly 2,000 years. In that time, there have been 265 popes. Christianity is the world`s
###45 largest religion. Roman Catholics are the largest group of Christians, and the pope
###49 is the head of the Roman Catholic Church. So, the person who holds this title, is a
###53 major religious leader. He is also a world leader. The pope is the head of state for
###58 Vatican City, the world`s smallest country.
###61 Second, who is this pope? Who is Benedict XVI? His birth name is Joseph Ratzinger. When
###67 someone is elected a new pope, he traditionally chooses a new name. Cardinal Ratzinger picked
###72 Benedict. He was born in Germany in 1927, became a priest in 1951, was made a cardinal
###79 in 1977, and in 2005 he was elected pope. He`ll stop being pope in February, 28th, at
###86 8 p.m. local time in Rome.
###88 So, what happens next? The college of cardinals, leaders in the Catholic Church will get together
###94 for something called a conclave -- that`s where they all elect a new pope. They each
###98 cast ballots, and if someone gets two thirds of the vote, plus one more that person becomes
###103 the new pope. If no one gets that many votes the first time, then the cardinals vote again.
###108 A spokesman from the Vatican said the elections would probably be sometime in March. He expected
###113 there to be a new pope by Easter.

###116 TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It`s a report card and it`s a prognostication. It is the
###120 president saying, this is what I would like to do in the coming year.
###129 The State of the Union is essentially a homework assignment from the framers of the Constitution
###133 to every president who`s lived ever since. The Constitution tells them that they periodically
###139 must tell Congress how the country is doing. If a president wants to lean hard to one side
###145 or hard to the other side, then you might see more political purpose in the State of
###150 the Union, although often it`s just a general sense of let`s move this direction.
###159 The whole thing is a huge pageant. The president comes walking in, escorted by members of the
###163 House and Senate, the Sergeant of Arms announces him and everybody stands, and cheers. And
###168 there`s quite a crowd there. Everyone has assigned seating, right behind the president
###172 you will find the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the President of the
###177 Senate, which will be the vice president of the United States, and then the two parties
###180 generally, generally stay on their side of the isle, although recently they started sitting
###186 with each other to suggest that they can get along a little bit better than most of us
###191 think. You typically have the Supreme Court there, the joint chiefs of staff. They are
###196 representing the military, and the First Lady will also be there, usually with some sort
###201 of special guest, in recent years. That will illustrate some point the president is making.
###209 One of the coolest parts of the presidential address is always the missing cabinet member
###216 and fearing out who it`s going to be. One member of the cabinet always has to be somewhere
###221 else, in case something terrible happened, so presumably, you could have the secretary
###225 of agriculture sitting somewhere thinking about hog futures, and suddenly he is the
###229 president of the United States, which would be a huge shock to him.
###237 Since the 1960s, the opposition has also issued a response. That is someone selected by the
###243 opposing party to stand up and refute what the president said or say, perhaps, we have
###248 different ideas about how the government should be conducting itself and where we should be
###252 going in the coming year.

###281 Mississippi. The state was hit by several storms, and look at this tornado. Part of
###287 the severe weather. The storm chasers pull up to the area that the tornado just ripped
###291 across. You can actually see some of the damage that it had just left behind. The Hattiesburg
###297 mayor said one good thing is that this twister hit on a Sunday, which meant most of the buildings
###303 that were damaged were empty. We`ve got a video that explains how tornadoes form, where
###307 they are most likely to show up. You could check that out in the resources box on our

###331 forces that helped the Americans regain control of parts of the base. It helped them recover
###337 comrades who were killed or wounded, and it gave them time to call for support. Because
###342 of his actions that day. Sergeant Romesha is the newest recipient of the Medal of Honor.

###398 AZUZ: January 1st, 1863, America was entering its third year of a devastating civil war.
###405 President Abraham Lincoln decided to broaden the goals of the war beyond the battlefield
###409 and take historic action on the question of slavery. He picked up a pen and signed the
###414 document known as the Emancipation Proclamation. It would become one of the most powerful presidential
###420 actions in American history. The proclamation said that "all persons held as slaves within
###425 any State of designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion
###430 against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free."
###435 Some historians estimate these words freed as many as 4 million slaves. Some former slaves
###440 in occupied territories then joined Union Forces, the liberated became liberators. It
###446 also changed the character of the Civil War. The Union was now fighting to create a new
###451 United States, one without slavery. Historians have called the proclamation the first step
###457 toward freedom for African Americans. It did not completely end slavery in the U.S., it
###462 technically freed the slaves only in the Confederacy, the states that were fighting the Union. But
###468 the proclamation tipped the scales in favor of those who wanted slavery to end. In the
###473 years and decades that followed what became known as the civil rights amendments, the
###477 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution freed all slaves, gave them the same legal
###483 rights enjoyed by white Americans and gave black men the right to vote. The document
###488 that started it all, the original Emancipation Proclamation, is kept in the National Archives
###493 in Washington, D.C.
###496 When we reported last week to the U.S. Post Offices planning end Saturday delivery, 53
###501 percent of the students on our blog said this will matter. Allen says he has checks, college
###506 applications and family letters in the mail. Meghan writes her boyfriend is a Marine, "the
###510 only way I will soon be able to talk to him is through letters and mail." Lisa calls this
###515 "... no big deal to people of the 21st century" who email, text or call if something needs
###519 to be shared. But Priscilla argues, "It`s not the same as a tangible letter." It`s harder
###524 to keep a treasured letter when all it is, is a bit of data on computer."
###529 Walking a dog -- not that interesting. Walking a horse -- getting better. A dog walking a
###535 horse, jackpot. Now, the pooch is persisting in this Youtube video, but the mare just wants
###540 to mosey. So it looks like our main event is a good old-fashioned tug of war. You think
###546 the horse would rein supreme, but it`s been settled with the walking companion, and obviously,
###551 wants to unleash its energy. So, eventually, the horse does give in, and let the dog dictate
###558 the pace, even if it did this start this whole thing of as a naysayer.
###561 All right, it`s time for us to walk off. Teachers, we want to hear your thoughts on today`s show,
###566 on any show. Go to our homepage, look for the feedback link in the resources box. We`ll
###570 see everyone back here tomorrow for more CNN STUDENT NEWS.
