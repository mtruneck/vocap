1
0:0:9,687 --> 0:0:12,168
Alright, just a few more feet.


2
0:0:12,168 --> 0:0:15,8
And... here we are, gentlemen,


3
0:0:15,8 --> 0:0:17,375
the Gates of Elzebob.


4
0:0:17,375 --> 0:0:18,83
Good Lord.


5
0:0:18,83 --> 0:0:22,183
Don't panic. This is what the
last 97 hours have been about.


6
0:0:22,183 --> 0:0:24,54
Stay frosty. There's a horde
of armed goblins


7
0:0:24,54 --> 0:0:27,942
on the other side of that gate
guarding the Sword of Asaroth.


8
0:0:27,942 --> 0:0:31,307
Warriors, unsheathe your weapons.
Magic wielders, raise your wands.


9
0:0:31,307 --> 0:0:32,488
Lock and load.


10
0:0:32,488 --> 0:0:34,824
Raj, blow the gates.


11
0:0:34,824 --> 0:0:36,916
Blowing the gates.


12
0:0:36,916 --> 0:0:38,162
Control,


13
0:0:38,162 --> 0:0:43,146
shift... B!


14
0:0:43,146 --> 0:0:46,293
Oh, my God, so many goblins!


15
0:0:46,293 --> 0:0:48,266
Don't just stand there,
slash and move!


16
0:0:48,266 --> 0:0:49,432
Stay in formation!


17
0:0:49,432 --> 0:0:51,177
Leonard, you got one on your tail.


18
0:0:51,177 --> 0:0:53,38
My tail's prehensile--
I'll swat him off.


19
0:0:53,38 --> 0:0:54,674
I got him, Leonard.


20
0:0:54,674 --> 0:0:58,389
Tonight I spice my mead
with goblin blood.


21
0:0:58,389 --> 0:1:0,484
Raj, no, it's a trap!
They're flanking us!


22
0:1:0,484 --> 0:1:2,56
He's got me!


23
0:1:2,56 --> 0:1:6,929
Sheldon, he's got Raj.
Use your sleep spell!


24
0:1:6,929 --> 0:1:10,985
I've got the Sword of Asaroth!


25
0:1:10,985 --> 0:1:12,75
Forget the sword, help Raj!


26
0:1:12,75 --> 0:1:16,574
There is no more Sheldon.
I am the sword master!


27
0:1:16,574 --> 0:1:19,201
- Leonard, look out!
- Damn it, man, we're dying here!


28
0:1:19,201 --> 0:1:21,739
Good-bye, peasants!


29
0:1:21,739 --> 0:1:25,115
The bastard teleported!


30
0:1:25,115 --> 0:1:28,974
He's selling the Sword
of Asaroth on eBay.


31
0:1:28,974 --> 0:1:31,623
You betrayed us for money?
Who are you?


32
0:1:31,623 --> 0:1:32,98
I'm a rogue night elf.


33
0:1:32,98 --> 0:1:35,591
Don't you people read
character descriptions?


34
0:1:35,591 --> 0:1:38,186
Wait, wait!
Somebody just clicked "Buy it now."


35
0:1:38,186 --> 0:2:2,0
I am the sword master!


36
0:2:2,0 --> 0:2:5,9
Season 1 Episode 3:
The Fuzzy Boots Corollary


37
0:2:5,9 --> 0:2:7,6
I'm all sweaty.


38
0:2:7,6 --> 0:2:9,9
Anybody want to log on
to Second Life and go swimming?


39
0:2:9,9 --> 0:2:12,4
I just built a virtual pool.


40
0:2:12,4 --> 0:2:19,7
No. I can't look at you
or your avatar right now.


41
0:2:19,7 --> 0:2:23,3
Sounds like your neighbor's home.


42
0:2:23,3 --> 0:2:24,7
Excuse me.


43
0:2:24,7 --> 0:2:27,1
Don't forget the mail you took
accidentally on purpose


44
0:2:27,1 --> 0:2:28,6
as an excuse to talk to her.


45
0:2:28,6 --> 0:2:31,1
Oh, right, right, right.


46
0:2:31,1 --> 0:2:35,4
Stealing snail mail--
very old school. I like it.


47
0:2:35,4 --> 0:2:38,1
Penny,
the mailman, did it again...


48
0:2:38,1 --> 0:2:39,7
Sorry.


49
0:2:39,7 --> 0:2:41,5
Hi, Leonard.
This is Doug.


50
0:2:41,5 --> 0:2:43,1
Doug, this is my neighbor Leonard.


51
0:2:43,1 --> 0:2:46,4
What's up, bro?


52
0:2:46,4 --> 0:2:49,7
Not much...


53
0:2:49,7 --> 0:2:51,9
bro.


54
0:2:51,9 --> 0:2:53,4
Is everything okay?


55
0:2:53,4 --> 0:2:56,1
Yeah, no, I just...
I got your mail again. Here.


56
0:2:56,1 --> 0:2:58,2
Thank you.
I've got to talk to that mailman.


57
0:2:58,2 --> 0:3:1,6
Oh, no, that's probably not
such a good idea.


58
0:3:1,6 --> 0:3:4,0
Civil servants have
a documented propensity


59
0:3:4,0 --> 0:3:7,5
to, you know, snap, so...


60
0:3:7,5 --> 0:3:9,5
Okay. Well, thank you again.


61
0:3:9,5 --> 0:3:11,9
No problem. Bye.


62
0:3:11,9 --> 0:3:22,4
Oh, and bye... bro.


63
0:3:22,4 --> 0:3:25,6
Penny for your thoughts.


64
0:3:25,6 --> 0:3:27,1
What's the matter?


65
0:3:27,1 --> 0:3:28,8
I'm fine.


66
0:3:28,8 --> 0:3:32,7
Penny's fine.
The guy she's kissing is really fine.


67
0:3:32,7 --> 0:3:37,8
Kissing, what kind of kissing?
Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?


68
0:3:37,8 --> 0:3:40,6
What is wrong with you?


69
0:3:40,6 --> 0:3:44,6
I'm a romantic.


70
0:3:44,6 --> 0:3:46,7
Don't tell me
that your hopeless infatuation


71
0:3:46,7 --> 0:3:48,6
is devolving into pointless jealousy.


72
0:3:48,6 --> 0:3:51,7
I'm not jealous.
I'm just a little concerned for her.


73
0:3:51,7 --> 0:3:53,7
I didn't like the look of the guy.


74
0:3:53,7 --> 0:3:59,1
Because he looks better than you?


75
0:3:59,1 --> 0:4:1,6
He was kind of dreamy.


76
0:4:1,6 --> 0:4:3,7
At least now you can
retrieve the black box


77
0:4:3,7 --> 0:4:5,5
from the twisted,
smoldering wreckage


78
0:4:5,5 --> 0:4:7,4
that was once your fantasy of dating her


79
0:4:7,4 --> 0:4:9,5
and analyze the data
so that you don't crash


80
0:4:9,5 --> 0:4:12,7
into Geek Mountain again.


81
0:4:12,7 --> 0:4:13,8
I disagree.


82
0:4:13,8 --> 0:4:16,9
Love is not a sprint,
it's a marathon--


83
0:4:16,9 --> 0:4:22,0
a relentless pursuit that only ends
when she falls into your arms...


84
0:4:22,0 --> 0:4:25,6
or hits you with
the pepper spray.


85
0:4:25,6 --> 0:4:27,4
I'm done with Penny.


86
0:4:27,4 --> 0:4:30,5
I'm going to be more realistic
and go after someone my own speed.


87
0:4:30,5 --> 0:4:32,8
- Like who?
- I don't know...


88
0:4:32,8 --> 0:4:34,0
Olivia Geiger.


89
0:4:34,0 --> 0:4:40,2
The dietician at the cafeteria
with the limp and the lazy eye?


90
0:4:40,2 --> 0:4:43,5
I don't think you have a shot there.


91
0:4:43,5 --> 0:4:46,8
I have noticed that Leslie Winkle
recently started shaving her legs.


92
0:4:46,8 --> 0:4:48,4
Now given that winter is coming,


93
0:4:48,4 --> 0:4:52,1
one can only assume
she's signaling sexual availability.


94
0:4:52,1 --> 0:4:54,4
I don't know.
You guys work in the same lab.


95
0:4:54,4 --> 0:4:56,8
- So?
- There are pitfalls.


96
0:4:56,8 --> 0:4:58,3
Trust me, I know.


97
0:4:58,3 --> 0:5:1,5
When it comes to
sexual harassment law,


98
0:5:1,5 --> 0:5:6,3
I'm a bit of a self-taught expert.


99
0:5:6,3 --> 0:5:8,6
If I were to ask Leslie Winkle out,


100
0:5:8,6 --> 0:5:11,3
it would just be for dinner.
I'm not going to walk into the lab,


101
0:5:11,3 --> 0:5:13,7
ask her to strip naked
and dance for me.


102
0:5:13,7 --> 0:5:19,7
Oh, then you're probably okay.


103
0:5:19,7 --> 0:5:21,8
- Hello, Leslie.
- Hi, Leonard.


104
0:5:21,8 --> 0:5:23,5
I'd like to propose an experiment...


105
0:5:23,5 --> 0:5:27,4
- Goggles, Leonard.
- Right.


106
0:5:27,4 --> 0:5:29,3
I would like to propose an experiment.


107
0:5:29,3 --> 0:5:30,5
Hang on.


108
0:5:30,5 --> 0:5:32,8
I'm trying to see how long it
takes a 500-kilowatt


109
0:5:32,8 --> 0:5:37,4
oxygen iodine laser to heat up
my Cup a' Noodles.


110
0:5:37,4 --> 0:5:46,9
I've done it. About two seconds.
2.6 for minestrone.


111
0:5:46,9 --> 0:5:48,7
Anyway, I was thinking more


112
0:5:48,7 --> 0:5:53,9
of a bio-social exploration
with a neuro-chemical overlay.


113
0:5:53,9 --> 0:5:57,2
Wait, are you asking me out?


114
0:5:57,2 --> 0:5:59,9
I was going to characterize it
as the modification


115
0:5:59,9 --> 0:6:2,0
of our
colleague-slash-friendship paradigm


116
0:6:2,0 --> 0:6:4,0
with the addition
of a date-like component,


117
0:6:4,0 --> 0:6:8,4
but we don't need to
quibble over terminology.


118
0:6:8,4 --> 0:6:10,1
What sort of experiment?


119
0:6:10,1 --> 0:6:12,7
There's a generally accepted
pattern in this area.


120
0:6:12,7 --> 0:6:15,1
I would pick you up,
take you to a restaurant.


121
0:6:15,1 --> 0:6:17,9
Then we would see a movie,
probably a romantic comedy


122
0:6:17,9 --> 0:6:21,7
featuring the talents
of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.


123
0:6:21,7 --> 0:6:23,4
Interesting.
And would you agree


124
0:6:23,4 --> 0:6:26,0
that the primary way we would
evaluate either the success


125
0:6:26,0 --> 0:6:27,6
or failure of the date would be


126
0:6:27,6 --> 0:6:30,4
based on the biochemical reaction
during the good night kiss?


127
0:6:30,4 --> 0:6:33,4
Heart rate,
pheromones, etc. Yes.


128
0:6:33,4 --> 0:6:35,7
Why don't we just stipulate
that the date goes well


129
0:6:35,7 --> 0:6:37,6
and move to the key variable?


130
0:6:37,6 --> 0:6:39,4
- You mean kiss you now?
- Yes.


131
0:6:39,4 --> 0:6:41,3
Can you define the
parameters of the kiss?


132
0:6:41,3 --> 0:6:43,2
Close-mouthed but romantic.
Mint?


133
0:6:43,2 --> 0:6:51,4
Thank you.


134
0:6:51,4 --> 0:6:52,9
I count down from three?


135
0:6:52,9 --> 0:7:2,7
No, I think it needs
to be spontaneous.


136
0:7:2,7 --> 0:7:5,0
- What do you think?
- You proposed the experiment.


137
0:7:5,0 --> 0:7:7,6
I think you should
present your findings first.


138
0:7:7,6 --> 0:7:9,5
Fair enough.


139
0:7:9,5 --> 0:7:11,7
On the plus side,
it was a good kiss.


140
0:7:11,7 --> 0:7:15,7
Reasonable technique,
no extraneous spittle.


141
0:7:15,7 --> 0:7:19,0
On the other hand, no arousal.


142
0:7:19,0 --> 0:7:25,3
- None?
- None.


143
0:7:25,3 --> 0:7:32,2
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.


144
0:7:32,2 --> 0:7:37,9
None at all?


145
0:7:37,9 --> 0:7:40,3
Sheldon,
if you were a robot,


146
0:7:40,3 --> 0:7:45,5
and I knew
and you didn't...


147
0:7:45,5 --> 0:7:49,0
...would you want me to tell you?


148
0:7:49,0 --> 0:7:50,7
That depends.


149
0:7:50,7 --> 0:7:51,9
When


150
0:7:51,9 --> 0:7:54,3
I learn that I'm a robot...


151
0:7:54,3 --> 0:7:57,6
will I be able to handle it?


152
0:7:57,6 --> 0:8:2,2
Maybe-- although the history
of science fiction is not on your side.


153
0:8:2,2 --> 0:8:4,6
Okay,
let me ask you this--


154
0:8:4,6 --> 0:8:6,8
when I learn that I'm a robot,


155
0:8:6,8 --> 0:8:11,3
would I be bound
by Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?


156
0:8:11,3 --> 0:8:17,8
You might be bound
by them right now.


157
0:8:17,8 --> 0:8:20,0
That's true.
Have you ever harmed a human being


158
0:8:20,0 --> 0:8:22,5
or through inaction allowed
a human being to come to harm?


159
0:8:22,5 --> 0:8:24,6
- Of course not.
- Have you ever harmed yourself


160
0:8:24,6 --> 0:8:26,1
or allowed yourself to be harmed


161
0:8:26,1 --> 0:8:28,8
except in cases where a human being
would have been endangered?


162
0:8:28,8 --> 0:8:34,8
- Well, no.
- I smell robot.


163
0:8:34,8 --> 0:8:36,2
Hey, what's going on?


164
0:8:36,2 --> 0:8:41,0
Internet's been down
for half an hour.


165
0:8:41,0 --> 0:8:44,9
Also, Sheldon may be a robot.


166
0:8:44,9 --> 0:8:47,8
So how'd it go with Leslie?


167
0:8:47,8 --> 0:8:52,1
Oh, we tried kissing,
but the Earth didn't move.


168
0:8:52,1 --> 0:8:58,3
I mean, any more than the 383 miles
that it was going to move anyway.


169
0:8:58,3 --> 0:9:0,5
Oh, I've seen that look before.


170
0:9:0,5 --> 0:9:2,7
This is just going to be
two weeks of moping


171
0:9:2,7 --> 0:9:4,3
and tedious emo songs


172
0:9:4,3 --> 0:9:9,5
and calling me to come down
to pet stores to look at cats.


173
0:9:9,5 --> 0:9:12,1
I don't know if I can take it.


174
0:9:12,1 --> 0:9:16,6
You could power down.


175
0:9:16,6 --> 0:9:20,7
As usual, Wolowitz has the solution.


176
0:9:20,7 --> 0:9:22,2
I happen to know a place


177
0:9:22,2 --> 0:9:35,8
where there are plenty of eligible women
and Leonard could have his pick.


178
0:9:35,8 --> 0:9:38,1
Remember the Latin hips.


179
0:9:38,1 --> 0:9:46,2
Shoulders stay still, and...
we sway.


180
0:9:46,2 --> 0:9:49,1
One, two, three...


181
0:9:49,1 --> 0:9:51,8
...five, six, seven.


182
0:9:51,8 --> 0:9:55,3
I think Mrs. Tishman's
got her eye on you.


183
0:9:55,3 --> 0:10:14,5
I've been there.
You're in for a treat.


184
0:10:14,5 --> 0:10:26,3
Oh, good Lord.


185
0:10:26,3 --> 0:10:29,0
God, that's a good song.


186
0:10:29,0 --> 0:10:32,8
If you're compiling a mix CD
for a double suicide.


187
0:10:32,8 --> 0:10:36,8
Oh, I hope
that scratching post is for you.


188
0:10:36,8 --> 0:10:39,6
I know what you're thinking.
I've taken your asthma into account.


189
0:10:39,6 --> 0:10:42,0
There's a feline geneticist
in San Diego


190
0:10:42,0 --> 0:10:44,9
who's developed the cutest
little hypoallergenic calicos.


191
0:10:44,9 --> 0:10:47,1
- Listen to me...
- I've been thinking about names.


192
0:10:47,1 --> 0:10:49,4
I'm kind of torn between
Einstein, Newton


193
0:10:49,4 --> 0:10:52,2
and Sergeant Fuzzy Boots.


194
0:10:52,2 --> 0:10:54,3
Do you really think
you can satisfy your need


195
0:10:54,3 --> 0:10:57,5
for a relationship with
a genetically altered cat?


196
0:10:57,5 --> 0:10:58,7
Maybe.


197
0:10:58,7 --> 0:11:1,5
If it's a cute, little, cuddly cat.


198
0:11:1,5 --> 0:11:5,8
Oh, come on. Leonard...


199
0:11:5,8 --> 0:11:9,8
This is obviously about Penny.


200
0:11:9,8 --> 0:11:11,4
It doesn't matter.


201
0:11:11,4 --> 0:11:15,5
The woman's not interested in me.
The woman rejected me.


202
0:11:15,5 --> 0:11:17,5
Look,


203
0:11:17,5 --> 0:11:19,4
I think that you have
as much of a chance


204
0:11:19,4 --> 0:11:21,4
of having a sexual relationship
with Penny


205
0:11:21,4 --> 0:11:23,4
as the Hubble Telescope
does of discovering


206
0:11:23,4 --> 0:11:25,0
at the center of every black hole


207
0:11:25,0 --> 0:11:30,8
is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.


208
0:11:30,8 --> 0:11:32,7
Nevertheless,


209
0:11:32,7 --> 0:11:35,9
I do feel obligated
to point out to you


210
0:11:35,9 --> 0:11:38,5
that she did not reject you.


211
0:11:38,5 --> 0:11:41,7
You did not ask her out.


212
0:11:41,7 --> 0:11:43,6
You're right.


213
0:11:43,6 --> 0:11:45,6
I didn't ask her out.
I should ask her out.


214
0:11:45,6 --> 0:11:48,6
No, no, that was not my point.


215
0:11:48,6 --> 0:11:51,3
My point was don't buy a cat.


216
0:11:51,3 --> 0:11:53,2
No, but you're right.


217
0:11:53,2 --> 0:11:56,2
I should march over there
and ask her out.


218
0:11:56,2 --> 0:12:7,2
Oh, goody, we're getting a cat.


219
0:12:7,2 --> 0:12:12,0
Good afternoon, Penny.
So, hi... hey.


220
0:12:12,0 --> 0:12:14,1
I was wondering if you
had plans for dinner.


221
0:12:14,1 --> 0:12:16,8
You mean dinner tonight?


222
0:12:16,8 --> 0:12:19,4
There is an inherent ambiguity
in the word "dinner."


223
0:12:19,4 --> 0:12:20,7
Technically it refers


224
0:12:20,7 --> 0:12:23,0
to the largest meal of the day
whenever it's consumed.


225
0:12:23,0 --> 0:12:25,8
So to clarify here,
by dinner I mean supper.


226
0:12:25,8 --> 0:12:28,8
- Supper?
- Or dinner.


227
0:12:28,8 --> 0:12:31,5
I was thinking 6:30 if you can go.
Or a different time.


228
0:12:31,5 --> 0:12:32,9
6:30's great.


229
0:12:32,9 --> 0:12:36,2
Really?


230
0:12:36,2 --> 0:12:38,7
- Great.
- I like hanging out with you guys.


231
0:12:38,7 --> 0:12:40,0
Us guys?


232
0:12:40,0 --> 0:12:43,8
Yeah, you know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj.
Who all's coming?


233
0:12:43,8 --> 0:12:46,1
They...


234
0:12:46,1 --> 0:12:49,7
might all be there.


235
0:12:49,7 --> 0:12:52,0
Or a subset
of them might be there.


236
0:12:52,0 --> 0:12:54,6
Algebraically speaking,
there are too many unknowns.


237
0:12:54,6 --> 0:12:56,9
For example,
Sheldon had Quiznos for lunch.


238
0:12:56,9 --> 0:12:59,5
Sometimes he finds that filling,
other times he doesn't.


239
0:12:59,5 --> 0:13:4,3
It's no fault of Quiznos--
they have a varied menu.


240
0:13:4,3 --> 0:13:6,8
Okay, whatever.
It sounds like fun.


241
0:13:6,8 --> 0:13:8,4
Great.


242
0:13:8,4 --> 0:13:10,1
- Did we say a time?
- 6:30.


243
0:13:10,1 --> 0:13:11,9
- And that's still good?
- It's fine.


244
0:13:11,9 --> 0:13:14,6
- 'Cause it's not carved in stone.
- No, 6:30's great.


245
0:13:14,6 --> 0:13:17,8
I'll get my chisel.


246
0:13:17,8 --> 0:13:21,2
Why?


247
0:13:21,2 --> 0:13:36,1
To... carve the...
I'll see you at 6:30.


248
0:13:36,1 --> 0:13:42,4
How do I look?


249
0:13:42,4 --> 0:13:45,9
Could you be more specific?


250
0:13:45,9 --> 0:13:49,1
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?


251
0:13:49,1 --> 0:13:55,8
No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns
under your arms conceal it nicely.


252
0:13:55,8 --> 0:13:57,8
- What time is your date?
- 6:30.


253
0:13:57,8 --> 0:13:59,2
Perfect. That gives you


254
0:13:59,2 --> 0:14:1,8
two hours and 15 minutes
for that dense molecular cloud


255
0:14:1,8 --> 0:14:4,6
of Aramis to dissipate.


256
0:14:4,6 --> 0:14:5,8
Is it too much?


257
0:14:5,8 --> 0:14:9,5
Not if you're a rugby team.


258
0:14:9,5 --> 0:14:11,0
If it should ever come up,


259
0:14:11,0 --> 0:14:13,1
you didn't join us
because you stuffed yourself


260
0:14:13,1 --> 0:14:15,2
with a chicken carbonara sub
at Quiznos.


261
0:14:15,2 --> 0:14:17,5
Why would I join you?


262
0:14:17,5 --> 0:14:21,5
No reason.


263
0:14:21,5 --> 0:14:24,0
You know what,
maybe this isn't such a good idea.


264
0:14:24,0 --> 0:14:26,6
No, well, now there's
always the possibility


265
0:14:26,6 --> 0:14:28,8
that alcohol and poor judgment
on her part


266
0:14:28,8 --> 0:14:32,9
might lead to a nice
romantic evening.


267
0:14:32,9 --> 0:14:36,5
You're right. Alcohol, poor judgment--
it could go well.


268
0:14:36,5 --> 0:14:38,5
There is the other
possibility,  that...


269
0:14:38,5 --> 0:14:40,6
this date kicks off
a rather unpleasant 6 months


270
0:14:40,6 --> 0:14:42,8
of the two of you passing
awkwardly in the hall,


271
0:14:42,8 --> 0:14:46,7
until one of you breaks down and
moves to another zip code.


272
0:14:46,7 --> 0:14:50,3
You could've stopped
at "it could go well."


273
0:14:50,3 --> 0:14:52,6
If I could've, I would've.


274
0:14:52,6 --> 0:14:54,8
I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy.


275
0:14:54,8 --> 0:14:58,2
There's no reason we couldn't go
and have a lovely dinner,


276
0:14:58,2 --> 0:15:0,4
maybe take a walk afterwards,


277
0:15:0,4 --> 0:15:2,8
talk about things we have in common.


278
0:15:2,8 --> 0:15:6,3
You love pottery?
I love pottery!


279
0:15:6,3 --> 0:15:7,8
There's a pause,


280
0:15:7,8 --> 0:15:10,0
we both know what's happening.
I lean in, we kiss.


281
0:15:10,0 --> 0:15:12,3
It's a little tentative at first,
but then I realize


282
0:15:12,3 --> 0:15:14,5
she's kissing me back.
She's biting my lower lip!


283
0:15:14,5 --> 0:15:16,6
She wants me!
This thing is going the distance!


284
0:15:16,6 --> 0:15:21,4
We're going to have sex!
Oh, God, oh, my God!


285
0:15:21,4 --> 0:15:24,7
Is the sex starting now?


286
0:15:24,7 --> 0:15:27,4
I'm having a panic attack.


287
0:15:27,4 --> 0:15:29,6
Well then... calm down.


288
0:15:29,6 --> 0:15:31,6
If I could,
I wouldn't be having a panic...


289
0:15:31,6 --> 0:15:34,3
That's why they call it a panic attack.


290
0:15:34,3 --> 0:15:36,1
Sit down.


291
0:15:36,1 --> 0:15:38,3
Yeah, sit down. Now close your eyes.


292
0:15:38,3 --> 0:15:40,1
- Why?
- Just do it.


293
0:15:40,1 --> 0:15:43,5
Now try to increase
your alpha wave activity.


294
0:15:43,5 --> 0:15:46,3
- What?!
- It's a biofeedback technique.


295
0:15:46,3 --> 0:15:48,5
It's relaxation through
brain wave manipulation.


296
0:15:48,5 --> 0:15:51,0
I read a paper about it
in Journal of American Neuroscience.


297
0:15:51,0 --> 0:15:54,1
It was a little sparsely sourced,
but I think the basic science is valid.


298
0:15:54,1 --> 0:15:56,5
I probably have it here somewhere.


299
0:15:56,5 --> 0:15:58,5
Who am I kidding?
I can't go through with this.


300
0:15:58,5 --> 0:16:0,1
You need to call her and cancel.


301
0:16:0,1 --> 0:16:1,4
- Me?
- Yes.


302
0:16:1,4 --> 0:16:4,9
- What should I tell her?
- I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.


303
0:16:4,9 --> 0:16:7,6
Not an illness that will make her
want to take care of me,


304
0:16:7,6 --> 0:16:9,9
but nothing so critical
that she'll feel uncomfortable


305
0:16:9,9 --> 0:16:12,1
going out with me
if I want to try this again.


306
0:16:12,1 --> 0:16:19,4
Got it.
So I'm assuming nothing venereal?


307
0:16:19,4 --> 0:16:21,8
I'll just tell her
that you had a routine colonoscopy


308
0:16:21,8 --> 0:16:24,2
and haven't quite bounced back.


309
0:16:24,2 --> 0:16:26,6
- Give me the phone.
- I thought you wanted to cancel.


310
0:16:26,6 --> 0:16:30,2
I can't, because if I don't show up
she'll still be expecting you.


311
0:16:30,2 --> 0:16:33,1
Why would she be expecting me?


312
0:16:33,1 --> 0:16:34,9
Stop asking me all these questions.


313
0:16:34,9 --> 0:16:40,2
I need to take another shower.


314
0:16:40,2 --> 0:16:42,2
So are the rest of the guys
meeting us here?


315
0:16:42,2 --> 0:16:45,1
Oh, yeah... no.


316
0:16:45,1 --> 0:16:48,9
It turns out that Raj
and Howard had to work, and Sheldon...


317
0:16:48,9 --> 0:16:54,2
had a colonoscopy and he hasn't
quite bounced back yet.


318
0:16:54,2 --> 0:16:56,2
My uncle just had a colonoscopy.


319
0:16:56,2 --> 0:16:57,4
You're kidding.


320
0:16:57,4 --> 0:17:0,8
Then that's something
we have in common.


321
0:17:0,8 --> 0:17:2,6
How?


322
0:17:2,6 --> 0:17:5,5
We both have people
in our lives who...


323
0:17:5,5 --> 0:17:14,9
want to nip intestinal polyps
in the bud.


324
0:17:14,9 --> 0:17:18,2
So what's new in
the world of physics?


325
0:17:18,2 --> 0:17:20,8
Nothing.


326
0:17:20,8 --> 0:17:22,3
Really? Nothing?


327
0:17:22,3 --> 0:17:25,2
Well, with the exception
of string theory,


328
0:17:25,2 --> 0:17:27,9
not much has happened
since the 1930s.


329
0:17:27,9 --> 0:17:29,7
And you can't prove string theory.


330
0:17:29,7 --> 0:17:31,2
At best you can say,


331
0:17:31,2 --> 0:17:37,9
"Hey, look, my idea
has an internal logical consistency."


332
0:17:37,9 --> 0:17:44,2
Well, I'm sure things will pick up.


333
0:17:44,2 --> 0:17:47,7
What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?


334
0:17:47,7 --> 0:17:49,1
Not much.


335
0:17:49,1 --> 0:17:53,7
We do have a chocolate key lime
that's moving pretty well.


336
0:17:53,7 --> 0:17:55,5
Good.


337
0:17:55,5 --> 0:18:0,0
Good.


338
0:18:0,0 --> 0:18:2,6
What about your...


339
0:18:2,6 --> 0:18:4,3
hallway friend?


340
0:18:4,3 --> 0:18:6,8
Doug?
Oh, yeah, I don't know.


341
0:18:6,8 --> 0:18:9,2
I mean, you know,
he's nice and funny, but...


342
0:18:9,2 --> 0:18:12,5
Can I get you started with some drinks?


343
0:18:12,5 --> 0:18:14,6
- You were saying? But...
- I'd like a drink.


344
0:18:14,6 --> 0:18:20,0
Just say the "but" thing about Doug
and then I'll get her back.


345
0:18:20,0 --> 0:18:21,6
I don't know, it's just me.


346
0:18:21,6 --> 0:18:24,0
I'm still getting over
this breakup with Kurt


347
0:18:24,0 --> 0:18:28,1
and this thing with Doug
would just be rebound sex.


348
0:18:28,1 --> 0:18:31,9
Don't get me started
on rebound sex.


349
0:18:31,9 --> 0:18:33,6
It's just... it's my pattern.


350
0:18:33,6 --> 0:18:36,1
I break up,
then I find some cute guy,


351
0:18:36,1 --> 0:18:39,8
and then it's just 36
meaningless hours of...


352
0:18:39,8 --> 0:18:43,1
you know.


353
0:18:43,1 --> 0:18:46,1
I'm not sure that I do.


354
0:18:46,1 --> 0:18:49,3
Is that one 36-hour experience,


355
0:18:49,3 --> 0:18:51,8
or is that 36 hours
spread out over, say...


356
0:18:51,8 --> 0:18:54,5
one glorious summer?


357
0:18:54,5 --> 0:18:56,1
No, it's usually over a weekend,


358
0:18:56,1 --> 0:18:59,2
and trust me, you do not feel
good after it.


359
0:18:59,2 --> 0:19:2,7
Well, chafing, right?


360
0:19:2,7 --> 0:19:3,9
Emotionally.


361
0:19:3,9 --> 0:19:13,8
Of course, yeah,
emotional chafing.


362
0:19:13,8 --> 0:19:17,4
Do you want to see something cool?


363
0:19:17,4 --> 0:19:20,1
I can make this olive
go into this glass


364
0:19:20,1 --> 0:19:22,1
without touching it.


365
0:19:22,1 --> 0:19:30,4
- How?
- Physics.


366
0:19:30,4 --> 0:19:32,2
Centrifugal force.


367
0:19:32,2 --> 0:19:34,5
Actually, it's centripetal force,


368
0:19:34,5 --> 0:19:37,1
which is an inward force
generated by the glass


369
0:19:37,1 --> 0:19:39,9
acting on the olive...


370
0:19:39,9 --> 0:19:41,3
Excuse me.


371
0:19:41,3 --> 0:19:44,5
If you were riding
on the olive,


372
0:19:44,5 --> 0:19:46,7
you'd be in a non-inertial
reference frame


373
0:19:46,7 --> 0:19:49,6
and would...


374
0:19:49,6 --> 0:19:53,4
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.


375
0:19:53,4 --> 0:19:55,0
Did you spill ketchup?


376
0:19:55,0 --> 0:20:1,5
- No.
- I'm not okay.


377
0:20:1,5 --> 0:20:3,6
You sure you don't want to go
to the emergency room?


378
0:20:3,6 --> 0:20:6,3
No, I'm okay.
It stopped bleeding.


379
0:20:6,3 --> 0:20:9,5
I know, but you did throw up.
Isn't that a sign of a concussion?


380
0:20:9,5 --> 0:20:14,2
Yes.
But I get car sick, too, so...


381
0:20:14,2 --> 0:20:16,7
Sorry about
your car, by the way.


382
0:20:16,7 --> 0:20:20,4
It's fine.
You got most of it out the window.


383
0:20:20,4 --> 0:20:24,9
The poor guy on the bike.


384
0:20:24,9 --> 0:20:26,4
I had a nice time.


385
0:20:26,4 --> 0:20:29,0
Yeah, me, too.


386
0:20:29,0 --> 0:20:31,1
Well, um, good night.


387
0:20:31,1 --> 0:20:35,8
Good night.


388
0:20:35,8 --> 0:20:38,8
Was this supposed to be a date?


389
0:20:38,8 --> 0:20:41,1
This?


390
0:20:41,1 --> 0:20:44,8
No.


391
0:20:44,8 --> 0:20:47,0
Of course not.
This was just you and me


392
0:20:47,0 --> 0:20:49,2
hanging out with a bunch of guys
who didn't show up


393
0:20:49,2 --> 0:20:53,4
'cause of work and a colonoscopy.


394
0:20:53,4 --> 0:20:56,2
Okay, I was just checking.


395
0:20:56,2 --> 0:20:58,3
When I take a girl on a date--


396
0:20:58,3 --> 0:21:1,6
and I do--


397
0:21:1,6 --> 0:21:5,4
she knows she's been dated.


398
0:21:5,4 --> 0:21:8,0
Capital D.


399
0:21:8,0 --> 0:21:13,3
Boldface. Underlined.
Da...ted.


400
0:21:13,3 --> 0:21:15,2
I think I might have
a little concussion.


401
0:21:15,2 --> 0:21:21,5
I'm gonna go lie down for a while.
Good night.


402
0:21:21,5 --> 0:21:23,8
So, how was your date?


403
0:21:23,8 --> 0:21:29,2
Awesome!


404
0:21:29,2 --> 0:23:29,2
Score 1 for liquor and poor jugement.
