JACOB: Last week,
superstar DJ David Guetta


8
0:0:16,88 --> 0:0:18,963
let his fans know that he
has a surprise for them,


9
0:0:18,963 --> 0:0:21,71
if he gets to 50 million
likes on Facebook.


10

We have that surprise right now.

This is the exclusive sneak peak

0:0:27,18 --> 0:0:28,364
and it is amazing.

DAVID GUETTA: When I play in
a country for the first time,


15
0:0:30,78 --> 0:0:33,6
or in a place like this,
where it's quite a challenge


16
0:0:33,6 --> 0:0:35,89
to be in the middle
of the desert,


17
0:0:35,89 --> 0:0:37,88
I don't really know
what to expect.


18
0:0:37,88 --> 0:0:40,64

a 28-year-old woman

became the voice of freedom
for an entire country.

identity a secret for years,

but she's said to have the most
recognizable voice in Romania,


59
0:2:7,167 --> 0:2:8,75
aside from Communist
leader Ceausescu.
