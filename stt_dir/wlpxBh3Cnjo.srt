0:0:1,491 --> 0:0:32,802



3
0:0:32,802 --> 0:0:34,39
ROBERT TAGLIAPIETRA: Hi, I'm
Robert Tagliapietra.


4
0:0:34,39 --> 0:0:35,915
JEFFREY COSTELLO: And I'm
Jeffrey Costello.


5
0:0:35,915 --> 0:0:37,79
ROBERT TAGLIAPIETRA: And we're
Costello Tagliapietra, and


6
0:0:37,79 --> 0:0:39,41
you're watching Vice.


7
0:0:39,41 --> 0:0:40,84
It's funny when we met.


8
0:0:40,84 --> 0:0:46,8
We actually met at a nightclub,
and the joke was


9
0:0:46,8 --> 0:0:48,43
sort of, like, both of our
friends said we both looked


10
0:0:48,43 --> 0:0:49,9
alike, even back then.


11
0:0:49,9 --> 0:0:52,2
We were both dressed alike
at the same time.


12
0:0:52,2 --> 0:0:56,0
Also, we had the luck of
sharing a closet, too.


13
0:0:56,0 --> 0:0:58,55
So I think it's a lot of
things mixed together.


14
0:0:58,55 --> 0:1:1,695
JEFFREY COSTELLO: What you see
is what it always was.


15
0:1:1,695 --> 0:1:4,9
ROBERT TAGLIAPIETRA: It was on
our 17th-year anniversary that


16
0:1:4,9 --> 0:1:4,87
we got married.


17
0:1:4,87 --> 0:1:6,11
JEFFREY COSTELLO:
It was simple.


18
0:1:6,11 --> 0:1:10,5
Basically, I had made some
cardigan jackets, and it was


19
0:1:10,5 --> 0:1:11,66
such a quiet affair.


20
0:1:11,66 --> 0:1:15,66
It's like we just had Rob's
mother and sisters come.


21
0:1:15,66 --> 0:1:19,5
I don't know, we just wore
khakis and sweaters.


22
0:1:19,5 --> 0:1:20,59
ROBERT TAGLIAPIETRA: There was
just something nice about


23
0:1:20,59 --> 0:1:21,62
actually having that--


24
0:1:21,62 --> 0:1:22,57
JEFFREY COSTELLO: Almost
validation.


25
0:1:22,57 --> 0:1:24,6
ROBERT TAGLIAPIETRA:
--that wedding ring


26
0:1:24,6 --> 0:1:26,875
and having that day.


27
0:1:26,875 --> 0:1:29,86
JEFFREY COSTELLO: I grew up
in suburban Pennsylvania.


28
0:1:29,86 --> 0:1:34,9
My parents are in the grocery
store/roadside stand, so I


29
0:1:34,9 --> 0:1:36,96
guess I was a little intrigued
by the farmers


30
0:1:36,96 --> 0:1:37,89
we had to deal with.


31
0:1:37,89 --> 0:1:41,77
To me that was so otherworldly,
to see real men


32
0:1:41,77 --> 0:1:43,1
working farms, dressing.


33
0:1:43,1 --> 0:1:44,71
I don't know, it just always
looked so cool,


34
0:1:44,71 --> 0:1:46,39
the cool work clothes.


35
0:1:46,39 --> 0:1:48,356
ROBERT TAGLIAPIETRA: When I
was in high school, I was


36
0:1:48,356 --> 0:1:53,32
obsessive over collecting The
Smiths' singles, so I have all


37
0:1:53,32 --> 0:1:54,83
the 12 inches.


38
0:1:54,83 --> 0:1:59,7
We love the soundtrack quality
of certain music to help


39
0:1:59,7 --> 0:2:0,87
define the collection.


40
0:2:0,87 --> 0:2:4,54
About four years ago, Jeffrey
and my mother were talking,


41
0:2:4,54 --> 0:2:6,74
and just through some casual
conversation, they found out


42
0:2:6,74 --> 0:2:9,639
that both of our grandmothers
had worked for Norman Norell.


43
0:2:9,639 --> 0:2:11,91
MALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN):
Quick, please, a gown.


44
0:2:11,91 --> 0:2:15,17
FEMALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN): Oh,
I'll be the talk of the town.


45
0:2:15,17 --> 0:2:16,46
ROBERT TAGLIAPIETRA:
Norman being a huge


46
0:2:16,46 --> 0:2:17,83
influence on us as well.


47
0:2:17,83 --> 0:2:22,0
But we both grew up in
households that sewed, so I


48
0:2:22,0 --> 0:2:28,82
think the craft of fashion,
it was embedded in


49
0:2:28,82 --> 0:2:30,4
us at an early age.


50
0:2:30,4 --> 0:2:33,44
I think that's why throughout
the building of our career,


51
0:2:33,44 --> 0:2:37,26
we've had such a concentration
on the craft, and it's been so


52
0:2:37,26 --> 0:2:40,8
important to our brand
in general.


53
0:2:40,8 --> 0:2:44,4
When we start designing it,
it's really about process.


54
0:2:44,4 --> 0:2:49,67
The way we approach a dress
is it starts almost


55
0:2:49,67 --> 0:2:50,6
mathematically.


56
0:2:50,6 --> 0:2:54,31
The way we build collections
out, the way we create any


57
0:2:54,31 --> 0:2:58,31
kind of garment, it's just as
based on the process as it is


58
0:2:58,31 --> 0:2:59,8
everything else.


59
0:2:59,8 --> 0:3:4,78
I guess we approach fashion in
the way you would almost


60
0:3:4,78 --> 0:3:6,15
approach painting.


61
0:3:6,15 --> 0:3:9,4
For us, it kind of starts at
the pattern-making table.


62
0:3:9,4 --> 0:3:14,55
We love playing with patterns
and ideas that way, and then I


63
0:3:14,55 --> 0:3:16,57
think it slowly develops
that way.


64
0:3:16,57 --> 0:3:18,81
And then on the other side,
you have color.


65
0:3:18,81 --> 0:3:22,57
And I think for us, it could be
just a painting or a movie


66
0:3:22,57 --> 0:3:24,11
that inspires a color story.


67
0:3:24,11 --> 0:3:27,19
So you kind of work out your
color story, and then through


68
0:3:27,19 --> 0:3:32,6
that, through all those
processes, you start seeing a


69
0:3:32,6 --> 0:3:33,56
story develop.


70
0:3:33,56 --> 0:3:36,3
I like it when it's
not so clear.


71
0:3:36,3 --> 0:3:39,42
I love that dreamy quality that
can happen with stuff,


72
0:3:39,42 --> 0:3:41,13
with things you create.


73
0:3:41,13 --> 0:3:44,95
And for us, it's about that.


74
0:3:44,95 --> 0:3:48,57
We like to create something
that's otherworldly, that's


75
0:3:48,57 --> 0:3:52,58
not clearly definable
by trend or era.


76
0:3:52,58 --> 0:3:55,98
I feel like with a dress,
it's an object that's so


77
0:3:55,98 --> 0:3:56,97
modern, in a way.


78
0:3:56,97 --> 0:3:59,86
It's like this one-piece
dressing.


79
0:3:59,86 --> 0:4:3,19
It's almost like how we imagine
the future to be, just


80
0:4:3,19 --> 0:4:5,14
sort of one-piece dressing.


81
0:4:5,14 --> 0:4:8,9
But it's also this blank canvas
that you can create


82
0:4:8,9 --> 0:4:9,54
these beautiful things on.


83
0:4:9,54 --> 0:4:13,98
We're big boys, so I know the
difficulties of finding


84
0:4:13,98 --> 0:4:14,63
clothes sometimes.


85
0:4:14,63 --> 0:4:17,5
And I think not every dress is
meant for every type, but to


86
0:4:17,5 --> 0:4:20,279
have a selection of dresses that
have the ability to work


87
0:4:20,279 --> 0:4:22,96
on different body types is
really important, I think.


88
0:4:22,96 --> 0:4:25,31
You have to address those
issues sometimes.


89
0:4:25,31 --> 0:4:28,445
You realize who the customer
really is.


90
0:4:28,445 --> 0:4:31,81
It's not this 17-year-old
model that we


91
0:4:31,81 --> 0:4:32,64
shove down the runway.


92
0:4:32,64 --> 0:4:35,66
It's not what I think a lot of
designers think their ideal


93
0:4:35,66 --> 0:4:36,19
customer is.


94
0:4:36,19 --> 0:4:39,59
For us, it's like our job is to
make something that looks


95
0:4:39,59 --> 0:4:41,1
beautiful on the female form.


96
0:4:41,1 --> 0:4:43,155
And for us, it's got to
be effortless, too.


97
0:4:43,155 --> 0:4:45,15
I like that aspect to it.


98
0:4:45,15 --> 0:4:47,45
JEFFREY COSTELLO: And at the end
of the day, doesn't every


99
0:4:47,45 --> 0:4:52,26
woman really want to feel
beautiful, and not necessarily


100
0:4:52,26 --> 0:4:56,56
feminine, but at least beautiful
and put together?


101
0:4:56,56 --> 0:4:59,42
ROBERT TAGLIAPIETRA: Yeah, we
used to be big flea market


102
0:4:59,42 --> 0:5:2,3
people, and then we realized
that our apartment was


103
0:5:2,3 --> 0:5:4,7
becoming like a hoarder's
nest.


104
0:5:4,7 --> 0:5:6,48
I think that show Hoarders
was what really was


105
0:5:6,48 --> 0:5:7,51
eye-opening for us.


106
0:5:7,51 --> 0:5:10,1
We're like, OK, it's looking
a little similar.


107
0:5:10,1 --> 0:5:13,69
I think we like a level
of hoarder.


108
0:5:13,69 --> 0:5:16,4
It's kind of like an urban


109
0:5:16,4 --> 0:5:19,21
grandmother's lumberjack lodge.


110
0:5:19,21 --> 0:7:19,21
