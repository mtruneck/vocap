1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:31,43



2
0:0:31,43 --> 0:0:34,3
MARC GAGNE: A lot of people
ask why is he so


3
0:0:34,3 --> 0:0:35,18
good at what he does?


4
0:0:35,18 --> 0:0:38,8
Or why is anybody so good
at what they do?


5
0:0:38,8 --> 0:0:40,7
If I could answer that question,
I'd train a bunch of


6
0:0:40,7 --> 0:0:41,95
riders and retire.


7
0:0:41,95 --> 0:0:57,568



8
0:0:57,568 --> 0:0:59,54
JAKE GAGNE: My dad used
to race motocross.


9
0:0:59,54 --> 0:1:2,35
And I used to go to the track
and watch him when I was


10
0:1:2,35 --> 0:1:2,86
really young.


11
0:1:2,86 --> 0:1:5,85
And so he got me into it
and he got me started.


12
0:1:5,85 --> 0:1:8,62
Yeah, I pretty much live and
breathe and eat and sleep


13
0:1:8,62 --> 0:1:8,955
motorcycles.


14
0:1:8,955 --> 0:1:10,1
It's what I love doing.


15
0:1:10,1 --> 0:1:12,195
So every kind of motorcycles.


16
0:1:12,195 --> 0:1:15,33
I love motocross and I love road
racing and everything.


17
0:1:15,33 --> 0:1:17,596
I just love riding and racing.


18
0:1:17,596 --> 0:1:39,826



19
0:1:39,826 --> 0:1:42,296
MARC GAGNE: There's Jake
[INAUDIBLE] when he was young.


20
0:1:42,296 --> 0:1:43,23
There's me and the wif--


21
0:1:43,23 --> 0:1:44,7
[INAUDIBLE] marriage.


22
0:1:44,7 --> 0:1:47,2
Here's Jake when he first
started out, a little 50.


23
0:1:47,2 --> 0:1:49,26
He's probably about eight
years old right there.


24
0:1:49,26 --> 0:1:51,72
Then he got a lot of plaques
over on the wall over there.


25
0:1:51,72 --> 0:1:54,8
Back in the old days we used
to put all that stuff up.


26
0:1:54,8 --> 0:1:57,9
Now in case it gets cold
in the winter we've


27
0:1:57,9 --> 0:1:59,6
got a lot of firewood.


28
0:1:59,6 --> 0:2:2,52
JAKE GAGNE: Yeah, all these
trophies, pretty much every


29
0:2:2,52 --> 0:2:4,56
single one I think is from
motocross racing


30
0:2:4,56 --> 0:2:5,4
just since I was seven.


31
0:2:5,4 --> 0:2:7,7
So can't keep a lot of them in
the house because they just


32
0:2:7,7 --> 0:2:8,58
get all over the place.


33
0:2:8,58 --> 0:2:9,542
MARC GAGNE: Come on in.


34
0:2:9,542 --> 0:2:11,466
MAUREEN GAGNE: Want
chicken salad?


35
0:2:11,466 --> 0:2:13,6
MARC GAGNE: This is Jake's
humble abode.


36
0:2:13,6 --> 0:2:16,66
MAUREEN GAGNE: He comes home
from Europe every time he


37
0:2:16,66 --> 0:2:18,915
wants mom's cooking,
that's for sure.


38
0:2:18,915 --> 0:2:22,54
Well, his favorites are my
chili, spaghetti, my carne


39
0:2:22,54 --> 0:2:23,95
asada, my barbecues--


40
0:2:23,95 --> 0:2:26,34
I cook every night
for my baby.


41
0:2:26,34 --> 0:2:28,16
And he doesn't like tomatoes.


42
0:2:28,16 --> 0:2:29,638
He likes lemon pepper.


43
0:2:29,638 --> 0:2:34,12



44
0:2:34,12 --> 0:2:37,61
JAKE GAGNE: She takes care of
me, she makes me food--


45
0:2:37,61 --> 0:2:41,25
all the stuff a mom should
do, so she's good.


46
0:2:41,25 --> 0:2:44,11
MAUREEN GAGNE: Actually, this
is low-fat bacon, also, and


47
0:2:44,11 --> 0:2:45,36
all-wheat toast.


48
0:2:45,36 --> 0:2:47,722



49
0:2:47,722 --> 0:2:49,7
MARC GAGNE: This is
the living room.


50
0:2:49,7 --> 0:2:50,44
There's Jake's bicycle.


51
0:2:50,44 --> 0:2:52,9
He watches TV, that's his--


52
0:2:52,9 --> 0:2:53,165
what do they call those, Jake?


53
0:2:53,165 --> 0:2:54,135
JAKE GAGNE: Bicycle.


54
0:2:54,135 --> 0:2:55,105
MARC GAGNE: What kind?


55
0:2:55,105 --> 0:2:56,8
JAKE GAGNE: Spin.


56
0:2:56,8 --> 0:2:57,24
MARC GAGNE: Spin bike, yeah.


57
0:2:57,24 --> 0:2:58,27
Thanks, pal.


58
0:2:58,27 --> 0:2:59,99
So that's his spin bike.


59
0:2:59,99 --> 0:3:2,69
He tells me he puts in an hour,
hour and a half a day.


60
0:3:2,69 --> 0:3:5,84
MAUREEN GAGNE: I think he's a
normal teenager with a little


61
0:3:5,84 --> 0:3:6,85
bit of a 'tude.


62
0:3:6,85 --> 0:3:10,7
But he's a good kid and
he's very smart.


63
0:3:10,7 --> 0:3:13,455
And he's always had a 4.0
average in school.


64
0:3:13,455 --> 0:3:15,46
MARC GAGNE: The toughest change
for me is the fact that


65
0:3:15,46 --> 0:3:16,29
he's a teenager.


66
0:3:16,29 --> 0:3:19,77
And he's no different than the
teenager down the street, to


67
0:3:19,77 --> 0:3:23,27
the extent that he thinks he
knows everything and he thinks


68
0:3:23,27 --> 0:3:26,0
he doesn't need his dad
or his mom anymore to


69
0:3:26,0 --> 0:3:27,27
tell him what to do.


70
0:3:27,27 --> 0:3:30,3
Dad's just the one that keeps
everything in check.


71
0:3:30,3 --> 0:3:31,44
So I'm the bad guy.


72
0:3:31,44 --> 0:3:34,33
JAKE GAGNE: He just yells and
gets mad at everything.


73
0:3:34,33 --> 0:3:35,36
MAUREEN GAGNE: He doesn't
really yell.


74
0:3:35,36 --> 0:3:35,655
He just--


75
0:3:35,655 --> 0:3:37,646
JAKE GAGNE: No, he yells.


76
0:3:37,646 --> 0:3:39,23
MAUREEN GAGNE: Jacob!


77
0:3:39,23 --> 0:3:41,801
That's when we know.


78
0:3:41,801 --> 0:3:44,26
MARC GAGNE: Maureen's never
been one to go to the


79
0:3:44,26 --> 0:3:47,2
racetrack and watch
tons of races.


80
0:3:47,2 --> 0:3:49,93
She always likes to wait to
hear and see what happens.


81
0:3:49,93 --> 0:3:51,76
And you can't blame her, it's
her kid running around out


82
0:3:51,76 --> 0:3:54,2
there so it's a little
different.


83
0:3:54,2 --> 0:3:56,274
Us dads, we love to get
out there and get


84
0:3:56,274 --> 0:3:57,3
it and make it happen.


85
0:3:57,3 --> 0:3:58,92
MAUREEN GAGNE: I get nervous
when my son races.


86
0:3:58,92 --> 0:4:1,35
So it's better for me to be
home, and he's in Europe.


87
0:4:1,35 --> 0:4:4,9
And then I can watch him with
my girlfriend or my family


88
0:4:4,9 --> 0:4:6,51
watching him live,
and when I'm in


89
0:4:6,51 --> 0:4:8,176
another room, screaming.


90
0:4:8,176 --> 0:4:11,99
MARC GAGNE: This is some stuff
from Toriano Wilson, he's the


91
0:4:11,99 --> 0:4:14,72
one youngster that died
last year in Virginia.


92
0:4:14,72 --> 0:4:17,23
We always like to keep
him in our thoughts.


93
0:4:17,23 --> 0:4:18,68
I think Jake's still
wearing stickers on


94
0:4:18,68 --> 0:4:19,95
his helmet for Toriano.


95
0:4:19,95 --> 0:4:22,5
JAKE GAGNE: Toriano Wilson, he
was a great rider, and he was


96
0:4:22,5 --> 0:4:23,19
my friend and stuff.


97
0:4:23,19 --> 0:4:25,22
But you've got to try not to
think about it when you're out


98
0:4:25,22 --> 0:4:26,5
on the track.


99
0:4:26,5 --> 0:4:28,85
And just try not to
think about it.


100
0:4:28,85 --> 0:4:31,575
Keep it in the back
of your head.


101
0:4:31,575 --> 0:4:34,668
MAUREEN GAGNE: I'm going
to start crying.


102
0:4:34,668 --> 0:4:37,8
JAKE GAGNE: I know mom, she
gets worried and stuff.


103
0:4:37,8 --> 0:4:41,53
But I know that she still
trusts me and thinks


104
0:4:41,53 --> 0:4:42,5
that I'll be OK.


105
0:4:42,5 --> 0:4:46,17
MAUREEN GAGNE: I just want him
to be happy, and this is what


106
0:4:46,17 --> 0:4:46,83
makes him happy.


107
0:4:46,83 --> 0:4:51,56
And I'm not going to damage his
dreams, no matter what.


108
0:4:51,56 --> 0:4:53,6
If I told him he couldn't ride
again-- if I was his only


109
0:4:53,6 --> 0:4:57,6
parent and I said you can't ride
anymore, you would hate


110
0:4:57,6 --> 0:4:59,118
me for the rest of
your life, right?


111
0:4:59,118 --> 0:5:0,1
JAKE GAGNE: Yeah.


112
0:5:0,1 --> 0:5:1,88
MARC GAGNE: The only thing
I've ever asked of my son


113
0:5:1,88 --> 0:5:3,65
since we've been racing is
just never to give up.


114
0:5:3,65 --> 0:5:8,36
So that's a thing you learn in
life, that you never give up


115
0:5:8,36 --> 0:5:9,26
no matter what.


116
0:5:9,26 --> 0:5:11,34
You get knocked down,
you get back up.


117
0:5:11,34 --> 0:5:13,99
So that's all I've really
ever asked from him.


118
0:5:13,99 --> 0:5:15,68
But I think he's got an
incredible amount of pressure.


119
0:5:15,68 --> 0:5:17,98
One, to do very well
at school.


120
0:5:17,98 --> 0:5:21,36
Two, to stay away from any bad
elements that a 15-year-old


121
0:5:21,36 --> 0:5:22,11
might get into.


122
0:5:22,11 --> 0:5:24,13
I mean, there are still
kids out there, kids


123
0:5:24,13 --> 0:5:25,25
like to have fun.


124
0:5:25,25 --> 0:5:26,4
There's girls--


125
0:5:26,4 --> 0:5:40,236
I mean, hormones are raging
at 15-16 years old.


126
0:5:40,236 --> 0:5:42,62
BECKY: I grew up in Ramona
near Jake, and we went to


127
0:5:42,62 --> 0:5:47,727
middle school together and
that's how I know him.


128
0:5:47,727 --> 0:5:52,1
MARC GAGNE: Girls Jake
stays away from.


129
0:5:52,1 --> 0:5:54,2
His term is they're kind of
dream killers right now.


130
0:5:54,2 --> 0:5:56,56
BECKY: Everybody at the high
school talks about who he is


131
0:5:56,56 --> 0:5:58,126
and what he does and
how great he is.


132
0:5:58,126 --> 0:6:0,39
And he's always in the
"Sentinel." I'm


133
0:6:0,39 --> 0:6:0,945
really jealous of him.


134
0:6:0,945 --> 0:6:4,43
He look like he has fun out
there street racing and he


135
0:6:4,43 --> 0:6:5,44
does really good.


136
0:6:5,44 --> 0:6:7,66
And he's really fast, and
the bikes look like


137
0:6:7,66 --> 0:6:10,9
it's so much fun.


138
0:6:10,9 --> 0:6:13,67
MARC GAGNE: His interest lies
mainly in doing well in the


139
0:6:13,67 --> 0:6:14,25
sport he's chosen.


140
0:6:14,25 --> 0:6:17,55
And he knows that four or five
years from now he can go back


141
0:6:17,55 --> 0:6:18,28
and have all the young
girlfriends


142
0:6:18,28 --> 0:6:19,1
he'd like, I'm sure.


143
0:6:19,1 --> 0:6:21,942
So it's just a matter
of staying focused.


144
0:6:21,942 --> 0:6:26,19



145
0:6:26,19 --> 0:6:31,44
JAKE GAGNE: So it's 11 o'clock
here and I just woke up and


146
0:6:31,44 --> 0:6:35,92
went to bed at like 1 o'clock
earlier today.


147
0:6:35,92 --> 0:6:37,85
And I'm just staying
on European time.


148
0:6:37,85 --> 0:6:41,3
They all go to sleep when I'm
getting up, and then I'm up


149
0:6:41,3 --> 0:6:43,855
all morning in the dark,
so that kind of sucks


150
0:6:43,855 --> 0:6:44,515
[INAUDIBLE].


151
0:6:44,515 --> 0:6:46,84
MARC GAGNE: Basically what Jake
does, usually two weeks


152
0:6:46,84 --> 0:6:49,12
prior to an event unless they're
back to back like they


153
0:6:49,12 --> 0:6:52,35
are now, he'll start going to
bed at 4 o'clock in the


154
0:6:52,35 --> 0:6:54,1
afternoon, 3 o'clock
in the afternoon, 2


155
0:6:54,1 --> 0:6:54,74
o'clock in the afternoon.


156
0:6:54,74 --> 0:6:58,7
Works his way up to about noon,
11:00 AM and then turns


157
0:6:58,7 --> 0:7:1,6
around and gets back up about
when I go to bed at night


158
0:7:1,6 --> 0:7:2,76
about 10:30-11:00 PM.


159
0:7:2,76 --> 0:7:5,86
And then he'll stay up and do
his homework in the wee hours


160
0:7:5,86 --> 0:7:8,3
of the morning when
it's all dark.


161
0:7:8,3 --> 0:7:9,865
JAKE GAGNE: There's nothing
really to do this


162
0:7:9,865 --> 0:7:11,115
early in the morning.


163
0:7:11,115 --> 0:7:56,188



164
0:7:56,188 --> 0:7:58,635
A.J.: When he first started
racing he did motorcycles, and


165
0:7:58,635 --> 0:8:1,13
it didn't really mean a lot to
me until he started doing


166
0:8:1,13 --> 0:8:2,885
really good in Rookie's
Cup and stuff.


167
0:8:2,885 --> 0:8:5,75
DILLAN: We saw some videos of
him, and we were like oh,


168
0:8:5,75 --> 0:8:7,2
damn, he actually is good.


169
0:8:7,2 --> 0:8:9,31
A.J.: He doesn't come to school
anymore so everyone's


170
0:8:9,31 --> 0:8:10,39
always wondering how he does.


171
0:8:10,39 --> 0:8:12,48
And people see it
on TV sometimes.


172
0:8:12,48 --> 0:8:15,78
DILLAN: It kind of sucks,
because it's taking away from


173
0:8:15,78 --> 0:8:17,73
our hanging out and stuff.


174
0:8:17,73 --> 0:8:20,8
But he's going somewhere in
life, he's doing something


175
0:8:20,8 --> 0:8:22,38
cool and I'm stuck in Ramona.


176
0:8:22,38 --> 0:8:25,32



177
0:8:25,32 --> 0:8:28,56
I've never really asked
Jake to go to a party.


178
0:8:28,56 --> 0:8:29,69
I know he'll say no.


179
0:8:29,69 --> 0:8:30,93
A.J.: His dad would freak out.


180
0:8:30,93 --> 0:8:32,99
DILLAN: I think he's scared that
his dad will find out.


181
0:8:32,99 --> 0:8:33,37
A.J.: Yeah.


182
0:8:33,37 --> 0:8:35,36
MARC GAGNE: If his friends say
that they miss him, they


183
0:8:35,36 --> 0:8:35,929
probably do.


184
0:8:35,929 --> 0:8:41,64
But that was a choice that Jake
and I and his mom made.


185
0:8:41,64 --> 0:8:43,429
He knows going in that
it's going to


186
0:8:43,429 --> 0:8:44,679
require some sacrifice.


187
0:8:44,679 --> 0:10:44,679
