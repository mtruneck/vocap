1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:9,26



2
0:0:9,26 --> 0:0:10,51
-Mm.


3
0:0:10,51 --> 0:0:23,14



4
0:0:23,14 --> 0:0:24,5
BROOKS HEADLEY: I'm
Brooks Headley.


5
0:0:24,5 --> 0:0:28,33
I'm the pastry chef at Del
Posto in Manhattan.


6
0:0:28,33 --> 0:0:32,509
I kind of approach cooking and
food the same way that I would


7
0:0:32,509 --> 0:0:35,51
approach being in a punk band.


8
0:0:35,51 --> 0:0:38,53
The way that I would figure out
drum parts to a Born Again


9
0:0:38,53 --> 0:0:40,39
song, or a [INAUDIBLE] song.


10
0:0:40,39 --> 0:0:41,76
For cooking it's the same way.


11
0:0:41,76 --> 0:0:44,53
I'm not inventing new techniques
or anything, but I


12
0:0:44,53 --> 0:0:47,89
feel like I'm taking from
different styles of food--


13
0:0:47,89 --> 0:0:52,18
really, really simple stuff,
like almost stupid stuff and


14
0:0:52,18 --> 0:0:54,45
that's good.


15
0:0:54,45 --> 0:0:57,32
That's like a good punk song--
it should be stupid, and it


16
0:0:57,32 --> 0:0:59,28
should be direct, and
it should just


17
0:0:59,28 --> 0:1:0,71
be almost like duh.


18
0:1:0,71 --> 0:1:10,29



19
0:1:10,29 --> 0:1:13,17
I'm here with Michael Laiskonis,
a pastry chef from


20
0:1:13,17 --> 0:1:14,14
Le Bernardin.


21
0:1:14,14 --> 0:1:18,55
And we are headed to
Williamsburg to go to Sal's


22
0:1:18,55 --> 0:1:20,9
Pizza, my favorite pizza
place in the world.


23
0:1:20,9 --> 0:1:24,535



24
0:1:24,535 --> 0:1:26,63
MICHAEL LAISKONIS: I actually
think I met you as a pastry


25
0:1:26,63 --> 0:1:27,48
chef first, right?


26
0:1:27,48 --> 0:1:28,45
BROOKS HEADLEY: Yeah.


27
0:1:28,45 --> 0:1:30,9
MICHAEL LAISKONIS: And then
years later realized we had


28
0:1:30,9 --> 0:1:35,632
this sort of common interest
in punk rock, underground


29
0:1:35,632 --> 0:1:36,12
music scene.


30
0:1:36,12 --> 0:1:39,21
And realized probably 20 years
ago that there was a good


31
0:1:39,21 --> 0:1:40,6
chance we were in
the same room.


32
0:1:40,6 --> 0:1:43,6
BROOKS HEADLEY: Working in a
kitchen is kind of like being


33
0:1:43,6 --> 0:1:46,55
on tour, but being on tour
your whole life.


34
0:1:46,55 --> 0:1:51,335
Because it's something that
completely controls everything


35
0:1:51,335 --> 0:1:52,585
that you do.


36
0:1:52,585 --> 0:1:55,986



37
0:1:55,986 --> 0:1:59,858
When I think of pizza in New
York, I think of this place.


38
0:1:59,858 --> 0:2:3,69



39
0:2:3,69 --> 0:2:5,315
Can we get a grandma to go?


40
0:2:5,315 --> 0:2:9,61



41
0:2:9,61 --> 0:2:12,84
I lived basically around the
corner from Sal's for the


42
0:2:12,84 --> 0:2:15,38
first four years that I
lived in New York, so


43
0:2:15,38 --> 0:2:17,34
it became my spot.


44
0:2:17,34 --> 0:2:22,9
It was comfort food and
super old school.


45
0:2:22,9 --> 0:2:24,16
Real New York City pizza.


46
0:2:24,16 --> 0:2:26,41
MICHAEL LAISKONIS: Last time I
was at Del Posto I actually


47
0:2:26,41 --> 0:2:27,99
was sent home with a pizza.


48
0:2:27,99 --> 0:2:31,85
But it was a dessert pizza, but
he sent it out in a pizza


49
0:2:31,85 --> 0:2:34,78
box as we were leaving, so
that was pretty hot.


50
0:2:34,78 --> 0:2:37,36
BROOKS HEADLEY: Anytime I
can get pizza in there.


51
0:2:37,36 --> 0:2:39,64
But I actually went to the place
around the corner and I


52
0:2:39,64 --> 0:2:42,1
was like, hey, I want to
buy one pizza box.


53
0:2:42,1 --> 0:2:43,936
And the guy's like what
are you talking about?


54
0:2:43,936 --> 0:2:47,75
I find a lot of inspiration
in pizza in general.


55
0:2:47,75 --> 0:2:51,45
Whenever I can compare it, or
when I find that comparison in


56
0:2:51,45 --> 0:2:54,185
my head and it kind of works out
on the plate at Del Posto,


57
0:2:54,185 --> 0:2:55,23
it just cracks me up.


58
0:2:55,23 --> 0:2:58,74
Because I'm like oh, yeah,
this is pizza, you know.


59
0:2:58,74 --> 0:3:1,45
Sometimes it drives me a little
crazy that pastry chefs


60
0:3:1,45 --> 0:3:5,48
or people that make desserts,
they sort of have blinders on.


61
0:3:5,48 --> 0:3:9,13
And they're only thinking about
sugar or specific cakes


62
0:3:9,13 --> 0:3:10,42
or cookies or something.


63
0:3:10,42 --> 0:3:15,63
For me, the thing that I'd want
to do is cook a bunch of


64
0:3:15,63 --> 0:3:16,22
vegetables.


65
0:3:16,22 --> 0:3:19,82
So you're still thinking in
terms of different flavors,


66
0:3:19,82 --> 0:3:25,86
sweet and salty and bitter
and sour, just to


67
0:3:25,86 --> 0:3:27,18
highlight the product.


68
0:3:27,18 --> 0:3:31,3
And that's such an Italian
thing to do.


69
0:3:31,3 --> 0:3:31,91
-[INAUDIBLE]


70
0:3:31,91 --> 0:3:33,84
Sicilian, regular pizza,
you got plates.


71
0:3:33,84 --> 0:3:34,65
BROOKS HEADLEY: Great.


72
0:3:34,65 --> 0:3:35,336
Thanks, man.


73
0:3:35,336 --> 0:3:35,822
-All right?


74
0:3:35,822 --> 0:3:36,308
OK, have a nice day.


75
0:3:36,308 --> 0:3:37,558
BROOKS HEADLEY: Yeah.


76
0:3:37,558 --> 0:3:39,71



77
0:3:39,71 --> 0:3:41,38
So we got some pizza.


78
0:3:41,38 --> 0:3:46,73
Now we're going over to the
Momofuku Milk Bar, bakery,


79
0:3:46,73 --> 0:3:49,59
complex, airplane hangar spot.


80
0:3:49,59 --> 0:4:4,42



81
0:4:4,42 --> 0:4:13,5
Yeah, Christina Tosi who is
the master dessert pastry


82
0:4:13,5 --> 0:4:16,279
person for all of the Momofuku
restaurants and just one of my


83
0:4:16,279 --> 0:4:17,87
favorite people--
she's hilarious.


84
0:4:17,87 --> 0:4:21,74
Has a commissary basically in
Williamsburg where they make


85
0:4:21,74 --> 0:4:24,35
everything for all the different
restaurants and all


86
0:4:24,35 --> 0:4:25,31
their mail order and stuff.


87
0:4:25,31 --> 0:4:30,22
Her crack pie became world
famous, which is awesome,


88
0:4:30,22 --> 0:4:31,813
hilarious, and totally cool.


89
0:4:31,813 --> 0:4:42,922



90
0:4:42,922 --> 0:4:46,24
CHRISTINA TOSI: Come, I'll give
you the rest of the tour.


91
0:4:46,24 --> 0:4:47,26
It's my pride and joy.


92
0:4:47,26 --> 0:4:49,81
I named her Beyonce and
painted her gold.


93
0:4:49,81 --> 0:4:51,355
BROOKS HEADLEY: Excellent.


94
0:4:51,355 --> 0:4:52,87
Did you not have a
sheeter before?


95
0:4:52,87 --> 0:4:55,49
CHRISTINA TOSI: No, we were
rolling everything by hand.


96
0:4:55,49 --> 0:4:57,806
We were making all these
croissants at one point, it


97
0:4:57,806 --> 0:4:58,85
was like compound butter.


98
0:4:58,85 --> 0:5:0,54
And it was just getting to the
point that I was just like, no


99
0:5:0,54 --> 0:5:1,853
one's ever going to
roll fast enough.


100
0:5:1,853 --> 0:5:4,318
You know what I mean?


101
0:5:4,318 --> 0:5:6,783
-So this is our office.


102
0:5:6,783 --> 0:5:7,769
BROOKS HEADLEY: Whose
dogs are these?


103
0:5:7,769 --> 0:5:10,234
-These are Tosi's dogs.


104
0:5:10,234 --> 0:5:12,699
BROOKS HEADLEY: Dogs in the
kitchen, is that a violation?


105
0:5:12,699 --> 0:5:14,835
-We don't let the dogs
[INAUDIBLE], that's why they


106
0:5:14,835 --> 0:5:15,657
only ever live [INAUDIBLE].


107
0:5:15,657 --> 0:5:18,122
CHRISTINA TOSI: Are you guys
going anywhere after this?


108
0:5:18,122 --> 0:5:20,94
BROOKS HEADLEY: Yeah, we're
going back to Del Posto.


109
0:5:20,94 --> 0:5:21,573
MICHAEL LAISKONIS: Am
I working tonight?


110
0:5:21,573 --> 0:5:23,52
BROOKS HEADLEY: No, no.


111
0:5:23,52 --> 0:5:26,51
You're going to sit
down and relax.


112
0:5:26,51 --> 0:5:29,6
I'm going to put on
the paper hat.


113
0:5:29,6 --> 0:5:37,96



114
0:5:37,96 --> 0:5:43,52
Well basically at that point
we went and got some pizza.


115
0:5:43,52 --> 0:5:44,89
We got the grandma slice.


116
0:5:44,89 --> 0:5:47,67
Hung out with the ladies
at Milk Bar.


117
0:5:47,67 --> 0:5:51,55
And then the only responsible
thing to do at that point


118
0:5:51,55 --> 0:5:55,82
would be to go back to Del Posto
and eat some vegetables.


119
0:5:55,82 --> 0:5:59,5
I just wanted to invite some
people that I know, some


120
0:5:59,5 --> 0:6:1,335
through food and some
through music.


121
0:6:1,335 --> 0:6:2,86
Who was there?


122
0:6:2,86 --> 0:6:6,54
Rick was there, Amelia
was there, Erin was


123
0:6:6,54 --> 0:6:9,335
there, Tonie was there.


124
0:6:9,335 --> 0:6:13,98
That I knew would appreciate
eating a bunch of vegetables.


125
0:6:13,98 --> 0:6:16,43
So there's plenty to
drink out there if


126
0:6:16,43 --> 0:6:18,74
anybody needs anything.


127
0:6:18,74 --> 0:6:19,54
-Are there painkillers?


128
0:6:19,54 --> 0:6:20,436
Because I am--


129
0:6:20,436 --> 0:6:21,92
TONIE JOY: Probably
behind you.


130
0:6:21,92 --> 0:6:24,752
--Seriously need a break.


131
0:6:24,752 --> 0:6:27,34
MICHAEL LAISKONIS: I booked
shows at a place [INAUDIBLE]


132
0:6:27,34 --> 0:6:30,83
and they ended up playing
a year after I stopped.


133
0:6:30,83 --> 0:6:32,64
-I won't send you away.


134
0:6:32,64 --> 0:6:33,76
MICHAEL LAISKONIS: I'm OK.


135
0:6:33,76 --> 0:6:35,1
Awesome.


136
0:6:35,1 --> 0:6:36,5



137
0:6:36,5 --> 0:6:40,125
We geek out over both pastry
and punk rock, I guess.


138
0:6:40,125 --> 0:6:42,475
BROOKS HEADLEY: So listen you
guys, I'm going to go make us


139
0:6:42,475 --> 0:6:43,23
some vegetables, all right?


140
0:6:43,23 --> 0:6:43,721
-All right.


141
0:6:43,721 --> 0:6:44,703
-Oh, yeah.


142
0:6:44,703 --> 0:6:45,685
-I hope they're good.


143
0:6:45,685 --> 0:6:46,176
BROOKS HEADLEY: They better?


144
0:6:46,176 --> 0:6:46,667
Yeah, really?


145
0:6:46,667 --> 0:6:47,917
All right.


146
0:6:47,917 --> 0:6:57,97



147
0:6:57,97 --> 0:7:1,61
To me, vegetables are
totally sacred.


148
0:7:1,61 --> 0:7:6,51
When I was in bands 15 years
ago, that's all we did was


149
0:7:6,51 --> 0:7:9,58
talk about and think about
vegetarian food and veganism


150
0:7:9,58 --> 0:7:10,435
and whatever.


151
0:7:10,435 --> 0:7:15,55
So this is a butternut squash
and apple salad.


152
0:7:15,55 --> 0:7:19,29
And then this is just ricotta
with salt and pepper.


153
0:7:19,29 --> 0:7:24,957
Olive oil, roasted cauliflower
with olives and capers, so a


154
0:7:24,957 --> 0:7:27,98
total Mark Latimer classic.


155
0:7:27,98 --> 0:7:29,71
Chickpeas and leeks,
basically.


156
0:7:29,71 --> 0:7:32,69
And the leeks are sweated down
so they're totally sweet.


157
0:7:32,69 --> 0:7:38,2



158
0:7:38,2 --> 0:7:39,24
-Are you saying we're ready?


159
0:7:39,24 --> 0:7:40,49
BROOKS HEADLEY: I
think so, yeah.


160
0:7:40,49 --> 0:7:54,81



161
0:7:54,81 --> 0:7:58,91
-You have wine, liquor and
beer in front of you.


162
0:7:58,91 --> 0:8:2,315
-Listen, I came to party.


163
0:8:2,315 --> 0:8:5,22
BROOKS HEADLEY: So this is a
Anuloti with a Lambrusco


164
0:8:5,22 --> 0:8:5,48
sauce.


165
0:8:5,48 --> 0:8:6,43
-Oh, there's more?


166
0:8:6,43 --> 0:8:8,9
BROOKS HEADLEY: Speck, it's got
meat in it, so I made you


167
0:8:8,9 --> 0:8:10,4
a special one--


168
0:8:10,4 --> 0:8:14,92
pasta with butter,
for the babies.


169
0:8:14,92 --> 0:8:23,692



170
0:8:23,692 --> 0:8:25,56
-Are we really not getting
any dessert?


171
0:8:25,56 --> 0:8:27,43
BROOKS HEADLEY: No, you're going
to get some dessert,


172
0:8:27,43 --> 0:8:30,8
Obviously, the pastry chef
has to make some


173
0:8:30,8 --> 0:8:32,9
sort of dessert, right?


174
0:8:32,9 --> 0:8:36,36
I mean, I'm sort of a contrarian
deep to the core.


175
0:8:36,36 --> 0:8:42,72
So I had no desire to showboat
and make a bunch of desserts--


176
0:8:42,72 --> 0:8:44,82
oh, look at me, look
at what I can do.


177
0:8:44,82 --> 0:8:46,57
This is great, look at
this, this is great.


178
0:8:46,57 --> 0:8:52,31
So I made, obviously, the most
simple, almost silly, Italian


179
0:8:52,31 --> 0:8:53,86
dessert, which is tiramisu.


180
0:8:53,86 --> 0:8:56,8
The first place I ever worked,
we made individual ones and


181
0:8:56,8 --> 0:8:58,9
then we would put a
candle in that.


182
0:8:58,9 --> 0:9:2,29
But it had cocoa powder on top,
so when people would blow


183
0:9:2,29 --> 0:9:3,54
out the candle it would like--


184
0:9:3,54 --> 0:9:7,2



185
0:9:7,2 --> 0:9:12,69
I am full-on, 100% a restaurant
pastry chef.


186
0:9:12,69 --> 0:9:14,99
And even more specifically
than that, Del Posto.


187
0:9:14,99 --> 0:9:19,99
If you dumped me in another
kitchen in Manhattan, at


188
0:9:19,99 --> 0:9:22,1
another three or four
star restaurant, I'd


189
0:9:22,1 --> 0:9:22,81
probably get fired.


190
0:9:22,81 --> 0:9:26,28
Because I exist specifically
to do one


191
0:9:26,28 --> 0:9:29,73
specific style of food.


192
0:9:29,73 --> 0:9:33,34
Complicated doesn't necessarily
equal delicious.


193
0:9:33,34 --> 0:9:35,645
To a bunch of fucking
vegetables.


194
0:9:35,645 --> 0:9:37,1
-Yeah.


195
0:9:37,1 --> 0:9:38,56
I love it.


196
0:9:38,56 --> 0:9:39,18
Thank you, Brooks.


197
0:9:39,18 --> 0:9:40,68
-Thank you so much.


198
0:9:40,68 --> 0:9:41,93
-Thank you very much.


199
0:9:41,93 --> 0:9:43,98



200
0:9:43,98 --> 0:9:45,48
CHRISTINA TOSI: We are
well-fed, thank you.


201
0:9:45,48 --> 0:11:45,48
