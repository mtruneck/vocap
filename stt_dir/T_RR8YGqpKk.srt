0:0:37,511 --> 0:0:40,381
Give us this day our daily bread...


5
0:0:40,381 --> 0:0:42,683
and forgive us our trespasses...


6
0:0:42,683 --> 0:0:46,854
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.


7
0:0:46,854 --> 0:0:50,91
And lead us
not into temptation...


8
0:0:50,91 --> 0:0:53,6
but deliver us from evil.


9
0:0:53,6 --> 0:0:56,564
For Thine is the kingdom, the power...

[Man's Voice]
When I raise my flashing sword...


15
0:1:17,351 --> 0:1:22,356
and my hand
takes hold on judgment...


16
0:1:22,356 --> 0:1:26,46
I will take vengeance
upon mine enemies.


17
0:1:26,46 --> 0:1:30,197
And I will repay those
who haste me.


18
0:1:30,197 --> 0:1:33,3
O Lord, raise me
to Thy right hand...


19
0:1:33,3 --> 0:1:41,308
and count me
among Thy saints.


20
0:1:41,308 --> 0:1:45,613
And I am reminded
on this holy day...


21
0:1:45,613 --> 0:1:52,119
of the sad story
of Kitty Genovese.


22
0:1:52,119 --> 0:1:56,123
As you all may remember...


23
0:1:56,123 --> 0:1:59,26
a long time ago,
almost 30 years ago...


24
0:1:59,26 --> 0:2:3,497
this poor soul
cried out for help...


25
0:2:3,497 --> 0:2:6,133
time and time again...


26
0:2:6,133 --> 0:2:11,805
but no person
answered her calls.


27
0:2:11,805 --> 0:2:14,108
Though many saw...


28
0:2:14,108 --> 0:2:18,812
no one so much
as called the police.


29
0:2:18,812 --> 0:2:24,285
They all just watched as Kitty
was being stabbed to death...


30
0:2:24,285 --> 0:2:26,72
in broad daylight.


31
0:2:26,72 --> 0:2:33,427
They watched as
her assailant walked away.


32
0:2:33,427 --> 0:2:40,0
Now, we must all fear evil men.


33
0:2:40,0 --> 0:2:43,337
But there is
another kind of evil...


34
0:2:43,337 --> 0:2:48,142
which we must fear most...


35
0:2:48,142 --> 0:2:51,946
and that is the indifference...


36
0:2:51,946 --> 0:3:14,969
of good men!


37
0:3:14,969 --> 0:3:18,172
I do believe the monsignor's
finally got the point.

Aye.

You're gonna be
training her today.


44
0:4:28,942 --> 0:4:38,752
Aye.


45
0:4:38,752 --> 0:4:49,363
- Basically, the rule of thumb here is-
- Wait. Rule of thumb?


46
0:4:49,363 --> 0:4:53,334
In the early 1900s, it was legal
for men to beat their wives...


47
0:4:53,334 --> 0:5:3,177
as long as they used a stick
no wider than their thumb.


48
0:5:3,177 --> 0:5:5,212
Can't do much damage
with that then, can we?


49
0:5:5,212 --> 0:5:12,453
Perhaps it should've been
the "rule of wrist."


50
0:5:12,453 --> 0:5:14,588
I knew you two pricks
would give me problems.


51

I'm gonna have to
close down t-t-the bar.

his head, right? Why? 'Cause he's smart.

He knows the guy with the bandage
around his ass, he ain't goin' nowhere.

Where are you goin'?
Nowhere! That's right.

He ain't done yet. He comes over
and jumps on this guy's back...

superheroes triumphing over evil.

the rumors now.

These two are not heroes.

They're just
two ordinary men...

to come out on top.

we found out from the neighbors.

But dangerous? Very.

you can see you're outnumbered here.

He asks the Mexican what he wants.

Another possibility is they were
placed there with religious intent.

in the eyes of the dead. Or silver.

I'm sure the word you were looking for was
"symbolism." What is the symbolism there.

Let me explain it to you.


477
0:38:34,953 --> 0:38:37,289

to pay the toll to Charon...

across to the Gates of Judgment.

atone for what they did during their lives...

484
0:38:59,678 --> 0:39:3,782

that they used silencers.

Look at these
entry and exit wounds.

crisscrossed, and exited
through the eyeballs.


489
0:39:16,561 --> 0:39:19,498
This one clue tells us
three distinct facts.


490
0:39:19,498 --> 0:39:22,801
- Number one. Duffy?
- They shot him at a downward angle.


491
0:39:22,801 --> 0:39:28,14
- They put him on his knees?
- Excellent. Number two. Greenly.

They shot him
at a downward angle?


493
0:39:35,38 --> 0:39:39,551
It tells us
he was the last to die.


494
0:39:39,551 --> 0:39:41,586
And number three. Dolly.


495
0:39:41,586 --> 0:39:43,588

What did they do...

identical wounds?

But unlikely.
The angles are too extreme.

your noodle is going to shoot straight ahead.

well-aimed shots in just a few seconds?

- Aye.


540
0:44:20,598 --> 0:44:24,969
- Christ. We're good.
- Yes, we are.


541
0:44:24,969 --> 0:44:34,979
Now, what do you think
is in that little case there?


542
0:44:34,979 --> 0:44:38,149
- Fuck me!
- Oh.


543
0:44:38,149 --> 0:44:40,318
The hits just keep on comin'.


544
0:44:40,318 --> 0:44:42,687
Ow! Give it a smell.


545
0:44:42,687 --> 0:45:3,7
- I love our new job.
- [Doorbell Buzzing]


546
0:45:3,7 --> 0:45:6,1
Bastard.
This has got to be his big break.


547
0:45:6,1 --> 0:45:11,483
- Yeah.
- We've got to fuck with him, right?


548
0:45:11,483 --> 0:45:13,485
- Okay.
- [Laughing]


549
0:45:13,485 --> 0:45:15,487
Shh.


550
0:45:15,487 --> 0:45:18,757
Open the door.
I'm gonna grab him by the fuckin' hair.


551
0:45:18,757 --> 0:45:21,326
- [Screaming]
- Sit down!


552
0:45:21,326 --> 0:45:24,229
- Get down! Shut up!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!


553
0:45:24,229 --> 0:45:28,767
- We're on the same side. Please, don't shoot.
- Get on the ground!


554
0:45:28,767 --> 0:45:30,935
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
We're on the same side.


555
0:45:30,935 --> 0:45:33,471
Boss must've sent me
in as backup. I'm Rocco!


556
0:45:33,471 --> 0:45:36,407
- I'm the funny man. That ain't my name.
- Where's your gun?


557
0:45:36,407 --> 0:45:40,578
- Where's your gun?
- I'm the fuckin' funny man!
It's right here. Right here.


558
0:45:40,578 --> 0:45:43,548
That ain't my real name.


559
0:45:43,548 --> 0:45:47,152
What the fuck? Jeez!


560
0:45:47,152 --> 0:45:50,21
It's a fuckin' six-shooter!


561
0:45:50,21 --> 0:45:53,491
- [Panting]
- There's nine bodies, genius!


562
0:45:53,491 --> 0:45:58,496
What the fuck were you gonna do,
laugh the last three to death, funny man?


563
0:45:58,496 --> 0:46:3,568
Pappa Joe said there was only two!
In and out!


564
0:46:3,568 --> 0:46:6,437
Boy, you guys
sure did a good job.


565
0:46:6,437 --> 0:46:9,14
Ah, shit.
You guys are good, huh?


566
0:46:9,14 --> 0:46:11,142
Cool masks.
Where'd you get 'em?


567
0:46:11,142 --> 0:46:14,679
- We gotta do him right here!
- Right now!


568
0:46:14,679 --> 0:46:17,215
- Don't, please! I'm the funny man!
- Right.


569
0:46:17,215 --> 0:46:19,25
- Don't kill me! Don't kill me, please!
- Right!


570
0:46:19,25 --> 0:46:27,225
I'm the funny man!


571
0:46:27,225 --> 0:46:29,327
[Laughing Continues]


572
0:46:29,327 --> 0:46:35,967
[Conner]
What a fuckin' idiot!


573
0:46:35,967 --> 0:46:40,338
Fuckin'-What the fuckin' fuck-
Who the fuck-


574
0:46:40,338 --> 0:46:45,743
Fuck this fuckin'-
How did you two fuckin' fucks- Fuck!


575
0:46:45,743 --> 0:46:53,384
Well, that certainly illustrates
the diversity of the word.


576
0:46:53,384 --> 0:46:56,788
All these guys are Russian mob.


577
0:46:56,788 --> 0:46:59,824
But not like those two peons
in the alley the other day.


578
0:46:59,824 --> 0:47:2,827
These guys are all syndicate
bosses and underbosses.


579
0:47:2,827 --> 0:47:7,165
I have a dossier
on every man in this room.


580
0:47:7,165 --> 0:47:10,134
Since the Iron Curtain
has gone down...


581
0:47:10,134 --> 0:47:12,937
the Russian syndicates
have started to come here.


582
0:47:12,937 --> 0:47:17,242
And in the spirit of Glasnost, the Soviets
have opened their borders to the Mafia.


583
0:47:17,242 --> 0:47:20,311
But the Italians,
they aren't convinced...


584
0:47:20,311 --> 0:47:23,715
the grounds in Mother Russia are
fertile enough for organized crime yet.


585
0:47:23,715 --> 0:47:29,153
So they ain't ready to commit.
But the Russians are coming here anyway.


586
0:47:29,153 --> 0:47:31,756
They are unwelcome.


587
0:47:31,756 --> 0:47:35,627
So, what we have here,
gentlemen...


588
0:47:35,627 --> 0:47:38,529
is possibly the beginning...


589
0:47:38,529 --> 0:47:42,367
of the first
international mob war.


590
0:47:42,367 --> 0:47:45,503
Unless I've
totally missed something.


591
0:47:45,503 --> 0:47:48,6
I'm live from
the Copley Plaza Hotel...


592
0:47:48,6 --> 0:47:50,642
where we have just been informed
that the largest multiple murder...


593
0:47:50,642 --> 0:47:53,44
in Boston's history
has just taken place.


594
0:47:53,44 --> 0:47:55,246
We have learned that
there were nine victims...


595
0:47:55,246 --> 0:47:58,716
all deeply involved in a notoriously
violent Russian crime syndicate...


596
0:47:58,716 --> 0:48:0,718
right here in Boston.


597
0:48:0,718 --> 0:48:3,421
Anybody you think is evil?


598
0:48:3,421 --> 0:48:5,723
Aye.


599
0:48:5,723 --> 0:48:9,394
Don't you think
that's a little weird, a little psycho?


600
0:48:9,394 --> 0:48:15,667
Do you know what I think
is psycho, Roc?


601
0:48:15,667 --> 0:48:17,902
It's decent men
with loving families.


602
0:48:17,902 --> 0:48:20,872
They go home every day after work,
and they turn on the news.


603
0:48:20,872 --> 0:48:23,574
You know what they see?
They see rapists...


604
0:48:23,574 --> 0:48:25,777
and murderers and child molesters.


605
0:48:25,777 --> 0:48:27,779
They're all gettin' out of prison.


606
0:48:27,779 --> 0:48:30,848
Mafiosos...


607
0:48:30,848 --> 0:48:33,117
gettin' caught with 20 kilos...


608
0:48:33,117 --> 0:48:36,254
gettin' out on bail
the same fuckin' day.


609
0:48:36,254 --> 0:48:39,924
And everywhere,
everyone thinks the same thing-


610
0:48:39,924 --> 0:48:44,95
that someone should just
go kill those motherfuckers.


611
0:48:44,95 --> 0:48:47,865
Kill 'em all.
Admit it.


612
0:48:47,865 --> 0:48:53,504
Even you've thought about it.


613
0:48:53,504 --> 0:48:57,141
You guys should be
in every major city.


614
0:48:57,141 --> 0:48:59,277
This is some heavy shit.


615
0:48:59,277 --> 0:49:3,147
This is like
"Lone Ranger" heavy, man.


616
0:49:3,147 --> 0:49:8,786
Fuck it! There's so much shit
that pisses me off!


617
0:49:8,786 --> 0:49:11,756
You guys should recruit, 'cause
I'm sick and fuckin' tired...


618
0:49:11,756 --> 0:49:15,159
of walkin' down the street
waitin' for one of these crack-pipin'...


619
0:49:15,159 --> 0:49:18,629
ass-wipin', motherless
lowlifes to get me!


620
0:49:18,629 --> 0:49:20,932
Hallelujah, Jaffar.


621
0:49:20,932 --> 0:49:22,934
So you're not just talkin'
about mob guys, right?


622
0:49:22,934 --> 0:49:25,67
You're talkin' about pimps and drug dealers
and all that shit, right?


623
0:49:25,67 --> 0:49:29,44
Oh, yeah.


624
0:49:29,44 --> 0:49:32,81
Fuck. You guys could
do this every goddamn day.


625
0:49:32,81 --> 0:49:35,613
We're sort of like 7-Eleven.


626
0:49:35,613 --> 0:49:39,183
We're not always doin' business,
but we're always open.


627
0:49:39,183 --> 0:49:52,663
- Mmm. That is nicely put.
- Thank you very much.


628
0:49:52,663 --> 0:50:1,739
I will fuck you up, dude.


629
0:50:1,739 --> 0:50:13,251
So then we go right through
the fuckin' ceiling like this-
[Continues, Indistinct]


630
0:50:13,251 --> 0:50:18,656
Oh, boy. You fuckin' guys.
You ruined me.


631
0:50:18,656 --> 0:50:21,426
I'm fuckin' done.


632
0:50:21,426 --> 0:50:24,629
Permanent fuckin' package boy.


633
0:50:24,629 --> 0:50:28,733
Who said that?
You can take credit on that, you know?


634
0:50:28,733 --> 0:50:31,135
What, are you serious?


635
0:50:31,135 --> 0:50:34,739
Yeah. Fuck it.


636
0:50:34,739 --> 0:50:37,542
If you think about it,
it's all you can do, really.


637
0:50:37,542 --> 0:50:39,677
I mean, you can't go in there
and tell him it was us.


638
0:50:39,677 --> 0:50:41,746
[Conner]
Climb the corporate ladder, boy.


639
0:50:41,746 --> 0:50:44,816
Don Rocco.


640
0:50:44,816 --> 0:50:47,151
Fuck it.


641
0:50:47,151 --> 0:50:49,153
I'm doin' it. I deserve it.


642
0:50:49,153 --> 0:50:52,256
I've been workin' for those fat bastards
since I've been in high school.


643
0:50:52,256 --> 0:50:55,426
Look at this fuckin' place.
They're fuckin' me, man.


644
0:50:55,426 --> 0:50:59,697
They can suck
my pathetic little dick!


645
0:50:59,697 --> 0:51:2,3
And I'll dip my nuts
in marinara sauce...


646
0:51:2,3 --> 0:51:5,69
just so the fat bastards can get
a taste of home while they're at it.


647
0:51:5,69 --> 0:51:8,539
Fuck it!
I'm doin' it.


648
0:51:8,539 --> 0:51:11,342
It is done!
Shit!


649
0:51:11,342 --> 0:51:17,815
- Shit! Shit!
- Oh, my God!


650
0:51:17,815 --> 0:51:19,951
- What the fuck!
- I'm hit!


651
0:51:19,951 --> 0:51:21,953
Oh, fuck!


652
0:51:21,953 --> 0:51:26,591
[Rocco]
What the fuck!


653
0:51:26,591 --> 0:51:29,76
I can't believe
that just fuckin' happened!


654
0:51:29,76 --> 0:51:54,585
- Is it dead?
- Oh, my God!


655
0:51:54,585 --> 0:51:56,721
Donna's gonna be angry
about her cat.


656
0:51:56,721 --> 0:51:59,357
Shit.


657
0:51:59,357 --> 0:52:1,826
She's on every drug
known to man.


658
0:52:1,826 --> 0:52:5,296
She'd have sold the thing
for a dime bag. Screw her.


659
0:52:5,296 --> 0:52:8,366
[Laughing]


660
0:52:8,366 --> 0:52:10,835
I do kind of feel
like an asshole, though.


661
0:52:10,835 --> 0:52:13,271
Yeah, Roc, you sound
real remorseful there.


662
0:52:13,271 --> 0:52:17,909
She ain't been around
in weeks anyhow.


663
0:52:17,909 --> 0:52:20,344
Listen, something's been
botherin' me about last night.


664
0:52:20,344 --> 0:52:23,247
What?


665
0:52:23,247 --> 0:52:26,184
What if your boss knew how many fellows
were supposed to be there?


666
0:52:26,184 --> 0:52:29,32
- What are you-What are you sayin'?
- Think about it.


667
0:52:29,32 --> 0:52:31,689
Nine men, six bullets.


668
0:52:31,689 --> 0:52:34,959
Think they sold me out?
No way. No way.


669
0:52:34,959 --> 0:52:37,328
Listen, he probably knew
you'd end up nailin' the fat guy...


670
0:52:37,328 --> 0:52:39,497
maybe one or two more, but he had
to know you weren't walkin' out of there.


671
0:52:39,497 --> 0:52:41,999
Figure it out.
The shooter's dead at the scene.


672
0:52:41,999 --> 0:52:44,1
There's no in-depth investigation.


673
0:52:44,1 --> 0:52:46,47
They'll just slide right off
his fuckin' back.


674
0:52:46,47 --> 0:52:48,472
'Cause what the fuck?


675
0:52:48,472 --> 0:52:51,943
As much as I love you, man,
you are not exactly Don Corleone.


676
0:52:51,943 --> 0:52:53,945
No, no, that-


677
0:52:53,945 --> 0:52:56,214
That's just not the way things are done.
Besides, how does he know...


678
0:52:56,214 --> 0:52:59,283
I just don't get in there, see there's too many
of 'em, serve 'em their fuckin' food-


679
0:52:59,283 --> 0:53:1,352
Because he fuckin' knows you, Roc!


680
0:53:1,352 --> 0:53:4,822
A smooth hitter would have gone in there,
seen it was a fuckin' wash and slipped out.


681
0:53:4,822 --> 0:53:7,58
But you, he knows
this is your only shot.


682
0:53:7,58 --> 0:53:10,795
You've been waitin'
18 fuckin' years.


683
0:53:10,795 --> 0:53:12,73
No. No, no.
That-That-


684
0:53:12,73 --> 0:53:15,833
That just ain't the way-
No, that's bull-That's bullshit.


685
0:53:15,833 --> 0:53:18,97
You don't know what you're talkin' about.
That's just not the way things happen.


686
0:53:18,97 --> 0:53:22,173
I mean, thanks for your concern and all,
but that just ain't the thing of it.


687
0:53:22,173 --> 0:53:24,675
Do me a favor, all right?
Just roll it around a bit on your way in.


688
0:53:24,675 --> 0:53:26,677
- Will you for me?
- No. No rollin'.


689
0:53:26,677 --> 0:53:30,147
Nothin' needs to be rolled.
Fuck!


690
0:53:30,147 --> 0:53:32,917
- Where the fuck are you goin'?
Did you tell him?
- Of course I fuckin' told him.


691
0:53:32,917 --> 0:53:36,42
- Then what the fuck?
- You guys don't know that shit for sure!


692
0:53:36,42 --> 0:53:38,422
Oh, you're such a fuckin' retard!


693
0:53:38,422 --> 0:53:41,892
- Hey, fuck you!
- Oh, man, use your fuckin' brain for once!


694
0:53:41,892 --> 0:53:45,196
Is it so unbelievable that
they don't fuckin' care about ya?


695
0:53:45,196 --> 0:53:47,698
Oh, yeah, you two fuckin' micks
know what's goin' on, huh?


696
0:53:47,698 --> 0:53:53,37
- Fuck you both!
- This is not a fuckin' thing you
should gamble on, all right?


697
0:53:53,37 --> 0:53:55,239
I'm the fuck out of here.


698
0:53:55,239 --> 0:53:57,241
Fine! Fuck it!


699
0:53:57,241 --> 0:54:0,77
What kind of flowers you want
at your funeral, you dumb wop?


700
0:54:0,77 --> 0:54:2,446
- It's the last time I'm gonna see ya!
- I'll be back at nine!


701
0:54:2,446 --> 0:54:5,916
- Bury the fuckin' cat!
- Listen, you get in there...


702
0:54:5,916 --> 0:54:16,627
and you start gettin' a bad vibe,
you get the fuck out quick!


703
0:54:16,627 --> 0:54:18,763
- [Ringing]
- Hello?


704
0:54:18,763 --> 0:54:21,832
- [Rocco] Murph.
- Hey, Roc. You okay?


705
0:54:21,832 --> 0:54:24,769
Anybody call for me?


706
0:54:24,769 --> 0:54:27,38
No, man.
Are you sure you're okay?


707
0:54:27,38 --> 0:54:29,34
I'm fuckin' fine.


708
0:54:29,34 --> 0:54:31,709
I'll catch you on the flip side.


709
0:54:31,709 --> 0:54:39,917
[Line Disconnects]


710
0:54:39,917 --> 0:54:59,637
[Woman]

The victims were found...

at a local
adult entertainment parlor.

the three suspected mob-related killings...

earlier this afternoon...

There is no doubt that all
the victims have been criminals.

why a public outcry...

has not been heard.

was gonna do, but he had a good idea.

was no fuckin' accident.

1:22:10,766 --> 1:22:13,97
I'm confident that
their investigation will end...


1067
1:22:13,97 --> 1:22:18,14
in the apprehension
of the suspects.


1068
1:22:18,14 --> 1:22:21,61
- Fuckin' hell.
- What? What, that guy?


1069
1:22:21,61 --> 1:22:24,947
That's the guy that got us off the hook
with the Checkov thing.


1070
1:22:24,947 --> 1:22:27,49
- And he's one smart man.
- They got nothin'.


1071
1:22:27,49 --> 1:22:31,22
Well, this guy is very sharp.
If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.


1072
1:22:31,22 --> 1:22:35,591
- You bet your ass he will.
- Well, I'd say that makes him
a lia-fuckin'-bility.


1073
1:22:35,591 --> 1:22:39,328
- He isn't to be touched.
- He's a good man.


1074
1:22:39,328 --> 1:22:58,581
Okay, whatever.

1078
1:23:25,808 --> 1:23:43,526
I missed it.


1079
1:23:43,526 --> 1:23:46,462
Paul, you've already had quite a bit.
Are you sure you wanna-


1080
1:23:46,462 --> 1:23:50,166
- Just pour the drink, you fairy fuck.

This early mornin'
church shit's gotta go.


1086
1:24:14,557 --> 1:25:9,912
We have to go in the mornin'.
We're on the lam now, you know.

[Snoring]


1088

[Whispering]
You're gonna do what I say, got it?


1090
1:25:30,166 --> 1:25:32,768
- Yes.
- I'm sorry you're gonna have to see this.


1091
1:25:32,768 --> 1:25:34,77
- Don't look at me.
- I didn't see any-


1092
1:25:34,77 --> 1:25:37,6
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.


1093
1:25:37,6 --> 1:25:40,776
[Priest]
Don't do this, my son.


1094
1:25:40,776 --> 1:25:42,778
Have you no fear of God?


1095
1:25:42,778 --> 1:25:46,182
That's who I'm doin' this for.
Now open the fuckin' thing, Father.


1096
1:25:46,182 --> 1:25:48,851
Father, I'll do you right here.


1097
1:25:48,851 --> 1:25:54,523
God have mercy on my soul.


1098
1:25:54,523 --> 1:25:57,96
You little fuck, let him go, or
I'll drop you right fuckin' now.


1099
1:25:57,96 --> 1:26:1,3
Okay, just calm down.
He could hurt us, brother.


1100
1:26:1,3 --> 1:26:3,499
- He could ruin the whole thing.
- You let him go...


1101
1:26:3,499 --> 1:26:5,834
or I will deliver you
right fucking here!


1102
1:26:5,834 --> 1:26:8,771
You won't do it. You won't, Conner.
You love me, man.

[Whispering]
Do your thing, Father. Don't fuck this up.


1107
1:26:19,114 --> 1:26:22,518
- How long since your last confession?
- Christ.


1108
1:26:22,518 --> 1:26:25,721
I've never confessed.


1109
1:26:25,721 --> 1:26:28,324
I come here for advice...


1110
1:26:28,324 --> 1:26:31,26
not "slalvation."


1111
1:26:31,26 --> 1:26:35,13
Why have you come to a church
for counsel if you're not religious?


1112
1:26:35,13 --> 1:26:38,3
It's ethics.


1113
1:26:38,3 --> 1:26:41,67
I put evil men behind bars...


1114
1:26:41,67 --> 1:26:45,674
but the law has miles
of red tape and loopholes...


1115
1:26:45,674 --> 1:26:48,711
for these cocksuckers
to slip through.


1116
1:26:48,711 --> 1:26:52,348
I found... out
there are these two guys...


1117
1:26:52,348 --> 1:26:54,917
who fix the situation
with an iron fist...


1118
1:26:54,917 --> 1:26:57,19
as if they had God's permission.


1119
1:26:57,19 --> 1:26:59,521
God's permission?
God doesn't grant-


1120
1:26:59,521 --> 1:27:1,523
In this day and age...


1121
1:27:1,523 --> 1:27:4,193
I believe what they do
is necessary.


1122
1:27:4,193 --> 1:27:6,295
I feel it is correct.


1123
1:27:6,295 --> 1:27:8,664
A soul
is what gives us feelings.


1124
1:27:8,664 --> 1:27:11,6
It's like a conduit...


1125
1:27:11,6 --> 1:27:14,503
through which
the Lord speaks to us.


1126
1:27:14,503 --> 1:27:17,373
You felt your answers
would be here...


1127
1:27:17,373 --> 1:27:20,175
in the house
of the Lord today.


1128
1:27:20,175 --> 1:27:26,215
And you feel...
these men are necessary.


1129
1:27:26,215 --> 1:27:28,784
So the Lord has spoken to you
twice today.


1130
1:27:28,784 --> 1:27:30,786
Has He now?
[Scoffs]


1131
1:27:30,786 --> 1:27:35,557
You are the one who came into this church
speaking about beliefs and feelings.


1132
1:27:35,557 --> 1:27:39,194
Is it so hard to believe
that God has brought you here?


1133
1:27:39,194 --> 1:27:41,196
I guess not.


1134
1:27:41,196 --> 1:27:44,233
It's very easy
to be sarcastic about religion.


1135
1:27:44,233 --> 1:27:47,303
But it's much more difficult...


1136
1:27:47,303 --> 1:27:50,773
to take a stand.
[Sighs]


1137
1:27:50,773 --> 1:27:54,51
I wanna stand
for what I believe in, Father.


1138
1:27:54,51 --> 1:27:58,48
First you have to know
what your beliefs are.


1139
1:27:58,48 --> 1:28:2,951
I believe that these young men
are right.


1140
1:28:2,951 --> 1:28:6,555
- You know them personally?
- Yes.


1141
1:28:6,555 --> 1:28:10,125
Would they ever harm
an innocent person, for any reason?


1142
1:28:10,125 --> 1:28:13,329
No. They would never do that.


1143
1:28:13,329 --> 1:28:16,98
Well, the two Irish guys wouldn't.


1144
1:28:16,98 --> 1:28:19,601
The Italian guy, he might.
He's kind of an idiot.


1145
1:28:19,601 --> 1:28:22,304
I'm beginning to see.


1146
1:28:22,304 --> 1:28:25,474
All the things
I wish I could do...


1147
1:28:25,474 --> 1:28:28,77
these guys are doing.


1148
1:28:28,77 --> 1:28:31,814
W- W-What should I do?


1149
1:28:31,814 --> 1:28:35,417
Because I am a man...


1150
1:28:35,417 --> 1:28:38,354
who's supposed
to uphold the law.


1151
1:28:38,354 --> 1:28:42,257
The laws of God... are higher...


1152
1:28:42,257 --> 1:28:46,495
than the laws... of man.


1153
1:28:46,495 --> 1:28:50,866
Yes, I-I was thinking that too.
No, no. I was feeling it.


1154
1:28:50,866 --> 1:28:55,804
All I needed
was to hear you say it.


1155
1:28:55,804 --> 1:28:59,475
Amen. I will help them.


1156
1:28:59,475 --> 1:29:5,147
- Forgive me, Father.
- Thank you, Father.


1157
1:29:5,147 --> 1:29:7,583
Whatever.


1158
1:29:7,583 --> 1:29:14,356

Um, "dominus ominus," you know.


1161
1:29:22,998 --> 1:29:27,2
And remember, you're bound. You can't
talk to anyone about this. No one.


1162
1:29:27,2 --> 1:29:29,705
- Just get out of the church.
- Okay.


1163
1:29:29,705 --> 1:29:35,711
Just get out of the church!


1164

in mysterious ways.

that supposed to mean?

- The light hit the side of his face.


1167
1:29:46,688 --> 1:29:50,192
Looked like he had a gray beard.
Maybe late '50s, early '60s.


1168
1:29:50,192 --> 1:29:52,895
So you're telling me
it was one guy with six guns...


1169
1:29:52,895 --> 1:29:55,864
and he was
a senior freakin' citizen?


1170
1:29:55,864 --> 1:29:58,967
Yeah, and it's better if we find
this man before he finds us again.


1171
1:29:58,967 --> 1:30:1,77
I'll see what I can do.
How do I get in touch with you?


1172
1:30:1,77 --> 1:30:5,841
We'll hit Pappa Joe tonight,
right in the comfort of his own home.


1173
1:30:5,841 --> 1:30:8,61
We're gonna move on to New York.
It's just-


1174
1:30:8,61 --> 1:30:11,68
- It's getting a bit hot for us here.
- Be careful.


1175
1:30:11,68 --> 1:30:13,916
All right.
Call you tonight, afterwards.


1176

- Yeah, but it's not.

I don't know who he is. Nobody does.

He does a disappearin' act.

What did he bring him in for?


1180
1:30:28,63 --> 1:30:33,268
Well, he needs an outsider.
This Rocco kid is smart.

He knows everyone.
He'd spot our hitters a mile away.

Just for him- the package boy?


1183

He's the one shootin' up all his guys,
right? He's scared of the kid.


1184
1:30:43,779 --> 1:30:47,783
- Said he's good. He's got
every gun in the city up there.
- Up where?


1185
1:30:47,783 --> 1:30:50,652
Up at his house.
I don't know what's going on...

something to do with this kid.
