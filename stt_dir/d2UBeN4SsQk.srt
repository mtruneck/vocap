0:0:0,14 --> 0:0:6,99
this episode of the young texans brought
to you by a_t_ mobile


2
0:0:6,99 --> 0:0:11,7
national geographic just recently did
this guy case study on brazil and they


3
0:0:11,7 --> 0:0:15,309
noticed that the fertility rates in
brazil have decreased significantly in


4
0:0:15,309 --> 0:0:18,789
the past few decades and they want to
know why what's going on and he turned


5
0:0:18,789 --> 0:0:21,15
up in brazil there's been this whole


6
0:0:21,15 --> 0:0:23,41
uh... female empowerment movement right


7
0:0:23,41 --> 0:0:26,46
but it also has a lot to do with the
economy in brazil it has to do with


8
0:0:26,46 --> 0:0:30,129
poverty in brazil and it has to do a
soap operas believe it or not


9
0:0:30,129 --> 0:0:34,1
so it's really interesting live okay so
what happens is that you know when you


10
0:0:34,1 --> 0:0:36,249
watch soap operas in brazil and


11
0:0:36,249 --> 0:0:40,49
the story lines in the soap operas need
to be simplistic rectum or simple it is


12
0:0:40,49 --> 0:0:42,85
the war on the issue happens also easier
predicts


13
0:0:42,85 --> 0:0:46,999
so what happens is when in brazil will
watch the soap operas and


14
0:0:46,999 --> 0:0:50,64
they'll see the small families and
watching it on television


15
0:0:50,64 --> 0:0:56,81
almost glamorizes it so in past decades
you see women in brazil having ten plus


16
0:0:56,81 --> 0:1:1,3
children but then as soap operas become
more and more popular they're watching


17
0:1:1,3 --> 0:1:4,64
them they're saying all it is glamorous
little family i want to have a small


18
0:1:4,64 --> 0:1:9,4
family someone more women we have two
children sometimes only one and after


19
0:1:9,4 --> 0:1:12,26
giving birth del gopher sterilization


20
0:1:12,26 --> 0:1:13,83
while rehab


21
0:1:13,83 --> 0:1:14,7
exultation


22
0:1:14,7 --> 0:1:18,82
maisie how the culture can change how
much pop culture affects overall culture


23
0:1:18,82 --> 0:1:22,68
right and is also amazing the soap
operas have actually done some good in


24
0:1:22,68 --> 0:1:25,48
the world for the first time
unintentionally right i'd like to keep


25
0:1:25,48 --> 0:1:28,67
in mind that this is our just keeping
the storyline simple yet because they


26
0:1:28,67 --> 0:1:33,859
don't want a cast of ten k exactly okay
so they unintentionally have is the fact


27
0:1:33,859 --> 0:1:37,49
but idon't want you guys to think that
is that simplistic obviously other


28
0:1:37,49 --> 0:1:39,869
factors play a role you know the economy


29
0:1:39,869 --> 0:1:43,239
um... there's uh... the tremendous
amount of poverty in brazil people are


30
0:1:43,239 --> 0:1:46,669
are living in these tiny little
apartments so women that you don't


31
0:1:46,669 --> 0:1:49,779
realize look we don't need to have ten
kids you know we're living in this tiny


32
0:1:49,779 --> 0:1:54,29
apartment one or two is enough and after
having two they say the factories close


33
0:1:54,29 --> 0:1:57,769
they literally say that mister added
portuguese and then they go they add


34
0:1:57,769 --> 0:1:59,2
have their sterilization


35
0:1:59,2 --> 0:2:2,4
and of course of the macroeconomic
outlook over on this in a plot of the


36
0:2:2,4 --> 0:2:6,51
whole world this is how many more
reporter in brazil partly because of the


37
0:2:6,51 --> 0:2:7,689
pop culture center


38
0:2:7,689 --> 0:2:11,94
uh... is that in the past the reason you
had ten cases because one he worked


39
0:2:11,94 --> 0:2:16,75
surer amira survive and to that you feel
a lot of form for example the kids


40
0:2:16,75 --> 0:2:20,56
worked on the form some orchids you had
a more productive you could be now again


41
0:2:20,56 --> 0:2:25,41
these are broad simple the notion of the
true now if you do don't work out a form


42
0:2:25,41 --> 0:2:30,56
the ten kids far liability economically
speaking not that that benefit


43
0:2:30,56 --> 0:2:34,48
so obviously at some point you will
start again message ready


44
0:2:34,48 --> 0:2:38,0
handsomely combined all those factors in
the place it's actually a great thing


45
0:2:38,0 --> 0:2:43,27
the brazil's population that is now at a
point where it's not exponentially


46
0:2:43,27 --> 0:2:47,21
growing as it used to be rates actually
lower than the replacement rate okay so


47
0:2:47,21 --> 0:2:48,75
i have before


48
0:2:48,75 --> 0:2:53,65
each family had at or there were two
point out there d six children per


49
0:2:53,65 --> 0:2:58,159
family rain and that has dropped to one
point nine children per family merit


50
0:2:58,159 --> 0:2:59,909
and you know


51
0:2:59,909 --> 0:3:3,459
like historically you would have thought
in brazil wall places you would imagine


52
0:3:3,459 --> 0:3:4,769
that at all


53
0:3:4,769 --> 0:3:7,579
but it's even gone there licking my
ideal world


54
0:3:7,579 --> 0:3:11,569
uh... that we do it we all go uh...
under the replacement rate for quite


55
0:3:11,569 --> 0:3:15,1
some time laid out what happened like
demographically do you think it will


56
0:3:15,1 --> 0:3:17,589
happen but it won't happen for some time
rain


57
0:3:17,589 --> 0:3:21,859
but and because if you look at the
graphs of how


58
0:3:21,859 --> 0:3:25,519
extras in the field believe it's going
to work they think of our population


59
0:3:25,519 --> 0:3:28,469
over the world is going to continue to
increase


60
0:3:28,469 --> 0:3:31,46
uh... and forget it was ten or twelve
billion but in that


61
0:3:31,46 --> 0:3:32,11
ballpark


62
0:3:32,11 --> 0:3:38,15
and then also to decrease right right
and at some point you level up


63
0:3:38,15 --> 0:3:41,98
and you know they need to forge a mobile
hot spot for ninety nine nine a monthly
