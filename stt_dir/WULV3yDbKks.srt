2
0:0:19,31 --> 0:0:21,7
Hey, this is Christina
Milian and this is


3
0:0:21,7 --> 0:0:22,77
my crazy party story.


4
0:0:22,77 --> 0:0:24,8
So me and my girls decided
we're going to


5
0:0:24,8 --> 0:0:26,69
take a trip to Vegas.


6
0:0:26,69 --> 0:0:29,595
All of us girls had red lipstick
on and high heels.


7
0:0:29,595 --> 0:0:31,5
We started drinking
in the plane.


8
0:0:31,5 --> 0:0:32,294
I was drinking Bloody Marys.


9
0:0:32,294 --> 0:0:34,83
By the time we got to the hotel,
they sent us to this


10
0:0:34,83 --> 0:0:38,14
VIP room where they had
champagne and we made mimosas.


11
0:0:38,14 --> 0:0:39,49
We were just ready to party.


12
0:0:39,49 --> 0:0:42,56
So we went out to eat some
sushi, and after that


13
0:0:42,56 --> 0:0:43,81
[INAUDIBLE] took us to club.


14
0:0:43,81 --> 0:0:46,42
We were all being sexy,
touchy-feelie, having fun with


15
0:0:46,42 --> 0:0:47,17
each other, dancing.


16
0:0:47,17 --> 0:0:49,92
We started pounding tequilas
and shots.


17
0:0:49,92 --> 0:0:51,982
We had some guys that were
sitting next to us, and


18
0:0:51,982 --> 0:0:53,7
they're like, Ey, what's up?


19
0:0:53,7 --> 0:0:54,156
You guys want to
party with us?


20
0:0:54,156 --> 0:0:55,163
And we're like, yeah!


21
0:0:55,163 --> 0:0:55,656
Totally!


22
0:0:55,656 --> 0:0:56,55
Let's go!


23
0:0:56,55 --> 0:0:58,17
And they were like,
we're leaving!


24
0:0:58,17 --> 0:0:59,34
We're going to go to
the strip club!


25
0:0:59,34 --> 0:1:0,31
You guys wanna come with us?


26
0:1:0,31 --> 0:1:1,946
And we're like, Yeah!


27
0:1:1,946 --> 0:1:2,795
Let's go!


28
0:1:2,795 --> 0:1:6,1
We hop in their car with them
and somehow we end up at this


29
0:1:6,1 --> 0:1:9,7
VIP room with a bunch of Barbie
dolls with giant boobs.


30
0:1:9,7 --> 0:1:11,87
The next thing you know, the
guys break out these wads of


31
0:1:11,87 --> 0:1:14,51
$100 bills, and these
girls ran to


32
0:1:14,51 --> 0:1:16,125
us like hungry piranhas.


33
0:1:16,125 --> 0:1:19,28
So one thing led to another, of
course, more drinks, more,


34
0:1:19,28 --> 0:1:21,2
more, and more drinks.


35
0:1:21,2 --> 0:1:23,81
The same rules don't go for
girls that go for guys.


36
0:1:23,81 --> 0:1:26,83
And the strippers had these
giant balloon boobs, like


37
0:1:26,83 --> 0:1:29,63
motorboating them and-- you'd
stick your head in-between and


38
0:1:29,63 --> 0:1:30,65
you go [MOTOR NOISE]


39
0:1:30,65 --> 0:1:32,33
We all had a stripper on us.


40
0:1:32,33 --> 0:1:33,53
We all had to go to
the bathroom,


41
0:1:33,53 --> 0:1:34,435
really, really buzzed.


42
0:1:34,435 --> 0:1:36,59
And I think one of us
hurled a little bit.


43
0:1:36,59 --> 0:1:37,88
One of the guys is knocking
on the door.


44
0:1:37,88 --> 0:1:38,95
And he's like, what are you
guys doing in there?


45
0:1:38,95 --> 0:1:40,81
I was like, she's not
feeling good!


46
0:1:40,81 --> 0:1:42,34
And he's trying to push
the door open.


47
0:1:42,34 --> 0:1:44,113
My other girl's holding her
hair up for her and


48
0:1:44,113 --> 0:1:44,28
everything.


49
0:1:44,28 --> 0:1:46,29
Can't get hurl in your hair.


50
0:1:46,29 --> 0:1:48,35
And I'm like, oh my gosh,
I feel like I'm sick.


51
0:1:48,35 --> 0:1:49,5
I feel like I'm going
to be sick.


52
0:1:49,5 --> 0:1:51,2
A friend of mine happened
to be in town.


53
0:1:51,2 --> 0:1:52,11
I texted him, I'm like, dude!


54
0:1:52,11 --> 0:1:53,46
I need you to come save us!


55
0:1:53,46 --> 0:1:55,7
I think somebody spiked
our drinks.


56
0:1:55,7 --> 0:1:57,15
We made our great escape
out of the bathroom.


57
0:1:57,15 --> 0:1:58,346
We were like, we gotta go!


58
0:1:58,346 --> 0:1:59,52
We have to leave!


59
0:1:59,52 --> 0:2:1,455
That boy was downstairs
waiting for us


60
0:2:1,455 --> 0:2:3,73
with two silver Ferraris.


61
0:2:3,73 --> 0:2:6,49
And we hopped into the cars,
and we were like whoa!


62
0:2:6,49 --> 0:2:9,41
You saved the day!


63
0:2:9,41 --> 0:2:11,92
And that was my craziest
party story.


64
0:2:11,92 --> 0:4:11,92
