bjbjLULU GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight: a voyage
deep into the sea. A famous filmmaker and


2
0:0:4,759 --> 0:0:9,2
explorer made that journey yesterday to the
bottom of the Pacific, a place known as the


3
0:0:9,2 --> 0:0:15,66
Mariana Trench's Challenger Deep, some 300
miles Southwest of Guam. Tom Clarke of Independent


4
0:0:15,66 --> 0:0:21,25
Television News has the story. TOM CLARKE:
He's behind the two highest-grossing movies


5
0:0:21,25 --> 0:0:26,54
of all time, but this was James Cameron's
most ambitious production yet. MAN: Above


6
0:0:26,54 --> 0:0:30,13
all, have fun. JAMES CAMERON, filmmaker: Have
fun, exactly. TOM CLARKE: He set off in the


7
0:0:30,13 --> 0:0:34,24
middle of the night, but it makes no difference
when you're heading to the darkest place on


8
0:0:34,24 --> 0:0:41,329
Earth. Once in the water, the sub turns vertical
to drop like a torpedo to the bottom. Sinking


9
0:0:41,329 --> 0:0:47,19
like a stone, it still took James Cameron
two-and-a-half-hours to reach the bottom.


10
0:0:47,19 --> 0:0:52,45
His descent took him straight past the depth
of the English Channel at just 180 meters.


11
0:0:52,45 --> 0:0:57,88
He wasn't even halfway when he passed the
depth of the Titanic at 3,700 meters. That's


12
0:0:57,88 --> 0:1:2,399
more than two miles. And his journey into
the abyss even took him beyond the height


13
0:1:2,399 --> 0:1:8,21
of a submerged Everest, before he finally
reached the bottom of the trench, 11 kilometers,


14
0:1:8,21 --> 0:1:15,84
nearly seven miles deep. He was three hours
at the bottom and an hour coming back. So


15
0:1:15,84 --> 0:1:22,329
what exactly did the film director see? Well,
you will have to wait for the 3-D movie being


16
0:1:22,329 --> 0:1:27,229
released some time in the near future. But
the ocean's deepest spot might not be a blockbuster.


17
0:1:27,229 --> 0:1:34,289
MAN: You did it, man! JAMES CAMERON: We all
did it. This is a vast, you know, frontier


18
0:1:34,289 --> 0:1:39,439
down there that's going to take us a while
to understand that -- the impression to me


19
0:1:39,439 --> 0:1:47,77
was that it was a very lunar, very desolate
place, very isolated. My feeling was one of


20
0:1:47,77 --> 0:1:52,829
complete isolation from all of humanity. TOM
CLARKE: It may be featureless, but these videos


21
0:1:52,829 --> 0:1:58,38
from British researchers using robotic subs
have recently revealed remarkable animals,


22
0:1:58,38 --> 0:2:4,459
like these snailfish on a giant shrimp-like
arthropod from four miles down. Who knows


23
0:2:4,459 --> 0:2:6,52
what Cameron's team might find. JON COPLEY,
marine biologist, University of Southampton:


24
0:2:6,52 --> 0:2:9,879
There's always a very good chance of new species.
We have already heard that Jim Cameron has


25
0:2:9,879 --> 0:2:14,239
seen some sea cucumbers down there, very small
ones. So it will be fascinating. He is going


26
0:2:14,239 --> 0:2:18,34
to go back and collect some samples, we hope.
We should get to see what is down there. When


27
0:2:18,34 --> 0:2:23,99
we're deeper than two miles -- and that's
more than half our planet is covered by water


28
0:2:23,99 --> 0:2:27,879
that is two miles deep -- there's a 50-50
chance that we find new species. TOM CLARKE:


29
0:2:27,879 --> 0:2:33,959
James Cameron admits diving the Mariana Trench
is a boyhood dream fulfilled. What lurks beneath


30
0:2:33,959 --> 0:2:40,68
captured the public's imagination ever since
that record dive in 1960. And now it's attracting


31
0:2:40,68 --> 0:2:46,93
some other big fish too. Richard Branson and
Google's Eric Schmidt are now building deep-diving


32
0:2:46,93 --> 0:2:53,489
subs as well. The abyss, so far James Cameron's
private domain, is about to become the new


33
0:2:53,489 --> 0:2:59,659
frontier, provided you're rich enough. GWEN
IFILL: In addition to the 3-D movie, Cameron


34
0:2:59,659 --> 0:3:4,719
plans to direct a National Geographic special
using the footage he gathered in yesterday's
