###14 Buddhism is one of the most ancient belief systems in the world.
###19 Buddhism is both a religion and a philosophy.
###22 Only your own understanding saves you from suffering.
###26 It is practised by over 350 million people today.
###31 There are many people who feel attracted to a religion
###36 which empowers the human individual.
###40 I am going to travel to seven wonders of the Buddhist world.
###44 Seven wonders that give an insight
###47 to the long and rich history of Buddhism.
###50 At each location I'll meet Buddhists who will help me to understand
###53 the different concepts that form the core of Buddhist belief.
###58 I'm going to explore how it started, where it travelled
###63 and some of the most spectacular monuments built by Buddhists
###69 right across the globe.
###74 And to try to get to the bottom of the attraction of this philosophy for mankind
###79 for close on 2,500 years.
###86 Buddhism's numbers grow year on year
###89 and I'll be uncovering why
###91 as I experience seven modern and ancient wonders of the Buddhist world.
###114 This is north-eastern India,
###116 where Buddhism began around 500 years before Christ.
###120 Millions of pilgrims come to this country, and to the sacred city of Bodh Gaya,
###125 to visit the place where a young Indian Prince underwent
###128 a life-changing personal transformation
###130 and came to be known as the Buddha.
###134 I've studied the period in history when the Buddha lived for over 20 years
###139 and I just love it
###141 because this was such a radical age.
###145 This was a time when men like the Buddha,
###148 and Socrates in Ancient Greece,
###150 turned the world of belief upside down.
###153 Instead of focusing on tradition and convention and ritual,
###159 they dealt with ethics and the possibilities of the human mind.
###168 And I'm particularly fascinated to follow in the trail of Buddhism,
###173 because as the philosophy has travelled through 25 centuries,
###177 it's marked out a path that leads directly
###181 from ancient society to the modern world.
###187 This is Mahabodhi,
###189 the "great awakening" temple in Bodh Gaya in north-eastern India,
###194 our first wonder of the Buddhist world.
###206 The reason Bodh Gaya is here at all
###208 is because two and a half millennia ago, one man
###212 had an internal, personal revelation
###215 while he sat underneath a peepul tree.
###218 It's a very quiet, simple beginning to end up with all of this.
###227 That man was called Siddhartha Gautama,
###231 and we're told he renounced his privileges and family
###235 to embark on a rigorous quest.
###238 A journey to understand the inherent challenges of the human condition,
###242 sparked by the suffering, sorrow and deprivation
###246 that he saw all around him.
###250 It was a long and difficult journey.
###253 Siddhartha renounced the comforts of the material world.
###257 He meditated for weeks on end.
###259 He broke with the status quo
###262 in a region that had been dominated by the old gods
###265 for the previous thousand years.
###267 Finally he achieved Nirvana,
###270 what we loosely translate as Enlightenment,
###274 and became known as the Buddha or "the enlightened one".
###281 The Buddha, according to Buddhist scriptures,
###284 made his way to this spot, and determined not to move
###287 until he found an answer to the world's suffering.
###291 So, it was here, on one warm spring evening, 2,500 years ago,
###297 that the Buddha came to sit.
###300 We are told that all night he was tormented by demons
###305 but then, as the sun began to rise in the East, he found enlightenment.
###318 The Bodh Gaya temple is the Mecca of Buddhism.
###320 It is where the Buddha attained enlightenment
###323 according to their belief
###324 and the Bodhi tree, or a great- grandson of the Bodhi tree,
###328 still grows there.
###329 So, Buddhists go there to remember the great breakthrough
###332 that was the Buddha's discovery of the true nature of the universe.
###336 And inspired by the Buddha's example,
###338 you'll find visitors here from every corner of the globe,
###342 from the 90 or so countries where Buddhism still flourishes today.
###347 Bodh Gaya is one of those key sites
###350 for all Buddhists worldwide.
###352 It serves as a magnet, as a centre point, for Buddhists from around the world.
###357 You could say it's the place
###360 exactly where Buddhism started.
###363 I'm not a Buddhist, but if you ask anyone who's involved in Buddhism,
###367 they'll tell you that it's a very difficult philosophy
###371 to teach or to explain,
###373 and that the very best way to understand it is to experience it.
###378 And so, by experiencing Buddhism,
###381 I'm going to try to get to the heart of a philosophy
###384 that can sometimes seem complicated, out of reach.
###388 I'll start with the three key principles of Buddhism -
###391 what are known as its "Three Jewels".
###396 The first is the life and example of Buddha himself.
###403 All Buddhists are encouraged to model their approach to life on his.
###410 The most important single point in the Buddha's teaching,
###416 and one that distinguishes it very sharply from other religions,
###421 is that the Buddha taught that each of us
###425 is entirely and solely responsible
###429 for our own lives and our own salvation.
###433 No-one else can be responsible.
###439 The Buddha didn't claim any divine status,
###442 nor did he profess to be a personal saviour.
###445 He called himself a guide and teacher.
###447 His message appealed to people of all social classes in ancient India,
###452 to merchants, to farmers, and to the Untouchable caste.
###455 The Buddha, in the course of his spiritual awakening,
###459 rejected a good number of aspects of Hinduism.
###463 He rejected some philosophical components of Hindu beliefs,
###467 he was very critical of the position of the Brahmins or priests
###471 in society at that time, which was a very elitist position.
###475 He was similarly critical of the caste system.
###478 He positioned himself, as a result, outside of the caste system.
###482 The Buddha spent his remaining years travelling through deep forests,
###488 across mango groves, from village to village.
###491 The curious would bring food and clothing
###493 for the philosopher and his band of followers.
###495 And, in turn, he encouraged them
###498 to reconsider the purpose and point of life,
###501 to recalibrate their moral compass.
###507 Although the Buddha didn't establish a church or temple system as such,
###512 over time, the significant locations in his life
###515 were gradually turned into shrines.
###519 Originally Bodh Gaya was just a pastoral sanctuary,
###523 marked out with a stone balustrade,
###526 200 years or so after his death, but by the 6th century AD,
###530 a full-blown temple, the Mahabodhi Temple,
###534 marked the spot.
###538 About 400 years after, the first temple,
###540 that was built here for the worshiping of the Bodhi tree,
###543 was replaced by this kind of a temple, built to enshrine
###547 the iconic image of Buddha, which had gained currency by that time.
###552 The temple, particularly the Mahabodhi Temple,
###556 is representative of how important Buddhist temples were,
###559 and how, you know, this idea of building a temple to enshrine statues
###564 started from here.
###572 As Buddhism's travelled through the centuries,
###575 perhaps inevitably, it's taken on more the aspects of a religion,
###579 with temples and pilgrims and a religious hierarchy.
###586 You could be forgiven for mistaking Buddhism
###588 as one of the great, god-driven faiths of the world,
###593 but there is a key difference.
###595 By putting such an emphasis on a system of personal morality
###599 and breaking with the conventions and traditions
###603 and rituals of the past,
###605 in many ways, the Buddha was one of those men
###608 who gave us the modern world.
###609 And although he never denied that there were gods,
###613 he simply said
###615 you don't have to rely on the gods to make everything OK.
###621 According to Buddhist sources,
###623 having seeded a radical new world view,
###626 the Buddha died at the age of 84.
###630 His body was cremated but his bones remained unburned.
###635 They were distributed amongst the various tribes, rulers and kingdoms,
###639 who are now starting to follow the Buddhist way,
###642 and who honoured its founder by building monuments, or stupas,
###647 over his remains.
###649 In Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, stands The Bodanath Stupa,
###655 our second wonder of the Buddhist world.
###660 It was first built in the 5th or early 6th centuries AD,
###664 then rebuilt and restored a number of times,
###667 finally as this giant, enclosed tomb in the 14th century.
###672 It is the largest in the Indian subcontinent,
###676 a sacred place for thousands of Buddhists throughout the world.
###682 Here at Bodanath, I am going to find out more
###685 about the three jewels of Buddhism.
###688 Buddhism consists, as far as Buddhists are concerned,
###692 in three things which they call the three jewels.
###694 Those three things are closely connected.
###697 The first is the Buddha, the founder of their religion.
###701 The second is called the Sangha,
###703 and that is the community of monks and nuns.
###707 The third is called the Dharma.
###709 The Dharma refers to the preaching, the teaching of the Buddha.
###715 In other words, it's what the Buddha discovered and it's also the truth.
###719 As you walk around the Bodanath, here, you always have this sense
###723 that you are being watched
###724 and that's because the Buddha's all-seeing eyes
###727 are always staring down at you.
###729 That squiggle in the middle of his face, incidentally, is not his nose,
###733 it's actually the Sanskrit character for the number one,
###736 to represent a kind of unity in the Buddhist faith.
###740 Something you won't find represented up there are the Buddha's ears,
###744 and there is a particular reason for that.
###747 We are told that the Buddha said
###749 he never wanted to hear that he was being worshipped.
###755 And of course, that is what is so unique about Buddhism -
###759 this is a religion without a central authority figure.
###763 Instead there's just this credo that man is his own lord and master,
###768 that mankind itself can control humanity's destiny.
###776 It's not atheistic, because they do believe in the existence
###780 of, sort of, Gods and angels and so on, but they simply don't believe
###784 that those beings have the universe under control
###786 and therefore they cannot save us from suffering.
###789 They themselves need saving from suffering
###791 from a future time when they cease being gods
###794 and they become beings that are vulnerable to pain and suffering.
###802 At the Bodonath Stupa, one of the many people who come
###805 to circumambulate and to pay their respects to the Buddha
###808 is Ani Choying, a Buddhist nun
###810 famous throughout Nepal for her sweet singing voice.
###815 She is, in fact, known as the singing nun.
###819 This is a very highly spiritual place, we consider.
###823 It's a holy place, and we believe
###825 that all the great relics of the Buddha's are in the stupa
###829 and it holds a very special religious spot.
###833 And every people who come around here
###836 are always reciting mantras
###838 and really focusing on meditation,
###840 they do the circumambulation, prostration,
###844 to keep the physical healthy
###846 and the mind, to be energy clean,
###850 chanting mantras as well as doing prayers
###853 so trying to put yourself in a very good, positive discipline.
###859 This is a very, very highly blessed place.
###863 Ani is originally from Tibet.
###865 Thousands of Tibetan Buddhists now live in Nepal as refugees.
###870 The brand of Buddhism is as much Tibetan as it is Nepalese.
###874 Flexibility and diversity has always been one of Buddhism's strengths.
###879 The Buddha himself said there should be no one official Buddhist language.
###884 Instead, Buddhists are encouraged to focus on the universal relevance
###889 of the Buddha's wisdom.
###891 There are some people here who will tell you that
###895 buried deep in that stupa is a fragment of the Buddha's bone.
###900 Now, I'm not certain that we're going to be able to prove that
###903 but what is sure is that this is the biggest stupa
###907 in the whole of Nepal and one of the largest in the world,
###911 and it is immensely impressive,
###914 but do you know what's significant about it, actually
###917 is not how it looks but what it means
###920 because this was built to represent something very special.
###924 For the men who created this,
###926 this was nothing less than incarnation of the Buddha's mind.
###937 The symbolism of the stupa is very interesting because
###940 it takes the elements of earth, water, fire, wind and space,
###945 different shapes that represent those,
###947 and they put them in an ideal aesthetic form,
###950 and so the idea is that the Buddha's mind is the awareness
###954 that the universe is the ideal environment for the human being
###958 to achieve freedom from suffering.
###963 Around the Buddha gathered men who shared with him a common vision and goal.
###967 Gradually, this group came to be a formalized community,
###970 a body that took its name
###972 from the old aristocratic councils of the day. The Sangha.
###977 The Buddhist Sangha became a monastic tradition,
###979 comprising ordained monks and nuns
###982 and it's one of the three jewels of Buddhism.
###993 My first experience of the Sangha
###995 came at what felt like an ungodly hour.
###999 At Bodanath every morning, just after dawn, monks of all ages
###1003 gather to perform the first of many rituals of the day.
###1007 The Sangha is one of the oldest continuously active
###1011 spiritual organizations in the world.
###1015 LOW CHANTING
###1023 What's being recited here is a Tara Puja,
###1026 it's a chant that aims to ensure a kind of liberation from suffering.
###1030 And it's really interesting because "Tara" is thought to be
###1033 a female manifestation of Buddha's wisdom,
###1036 something which is incredibly potent.
###1039 I mean, this isn't just an abstract idea of wisdom
###1041 this is thought to be healing,
###1044 to actually be stronger than medicine itself.
###1048 DRUM BOOMS AND BELLS RING
###1053 The Sangha includes women and was set up
###1056 to allow those who wish to practise Buddha's teachings
###1059 a disciplined environment and maximum time
###1061 to focus on the philosopher's ideas,
###1064 free from the responsibilities and distractions
###1067 of a domestic or conventional lifestyle.
###1073 A few miles outside Kathmandu,
###1076 Ani, the singing nun, runs her own nunnery.
###1081 It's a refuge for girls, many as young as ten,
###1085 the age both sexes can embark on the life of a Buddhist novice.
###1089 SINGING
###1097 I have here mostly
###1100 girls from families who are facing some difficulties,
###1104 obviously poverty, and the other thing is
###1108 the fathers are often very ignorant.
###1110 They get carried away with the alcoholic behaviour, as well.
###1114 Very abusive behaviours, and they do not think that it is good
###1118 to send their girls to school,
###1120 so I try to collect them here,
###1122 and give them a much as I can give them.
###1125 Controversial for its time was the inclusion of women
###1128 among the ranks of the Sangha.
###1130 The Buddha allowed women to become nuns,
###1132 to lead a life devoted to spiritual development.
###1136 Like Buddhist monks, nuns are expected to remain celibate,
###1140 pure, since they are one of the three jewels of Buddhism,
###1145 not just Buddha's foot-soldiers
###1147 but an incarnation of the belief system itself.
###1152 So, I've learnt about two of the three jewels of Buddhism.
###1156 The Sangha and the life of the Buddha.
###1160 But what about the third jewel, the Dharma, or teachings?
###1165 You can, perhaps, help me out a bit. How do you describe Dharma?
###1170 What does Dharma mean to you?
###1173 According to my understanding,
###1175 what Dharma is to do whatever you do,
###1181 very practically, skilfully, for the benefit of all beings,
###1188 without causing any harm, and for their wellbeing,
###1192 including oneself and all, is Dharma.
###1200 SHE SINGS:
###1217 Dharma means the purity of heart. Dharma means peace,
###1223 and Dharma means wellbeing of all human society.
###1226 Are there special ways that you can achieve Dharma?
###1231 Are there rules and regulations that show you what to do?
###1234 We are taught what causes suffering and what can cause suffering,
###1240 and how to avoid causing suffering in life, one's own life.
###1246 And when you implement those teachings
###1251 I think that is what really contributes towards
###1254 one's own wellbeing and others' wellbeing,
###1257 and I think that is considered Dharma.
###1261 In the Buddhist context, the word Dharma refers, above all,
###1266 to the teachings of the Buddha as he rediscovered them
###1270 in the process of his progress towards enlightenment.
###1276 The reality of the Dharma which holds you free from suffering,
###1281 is what they take, the root of the word Dharma, which means to hold,
###1285 and the Buddha said Dharma holds a being free from suffering.
###1296 Coming here to Nepal, it has been relatively straightforward
###1299 to identify two of the jewels of the triple jewels of Buddhism.
###1304 The Buddha himself, both ideas about him and his image,
###1307 are absolutely everywhere, as is the Sangha,
###1310 and here in Kathmandu, there are monks and nuns at every street corner,
###1315 but what has been harder to pin down is the Dharma itself,
###1320 the belief system, the philosophy, the religion,
###1323 whatever you want to call it, of Buddhism.
###1326 Maybe it's unrealistic of me to expect there to be
###1329 one single definition for such a broad concept.
###1332 The Buddha himself said the Dharma was like
###1335 the salt of the oceans of the world, a universal taste.
###1340 So, the Buddha implied the Dharma could be tasted anywhere, by anyone,
###1346 but the question for me, as a historian,
###1349 is how that "taste" of the Buddhist Dharma could become "universal",
###1354 practically, how Buddhism established itself as a global belief-system.
###1360 Buddha's teachings were charismatic and radical for their time,
###1364 but, as with all big new ideas,
###1366 they needed a groundswell of popular support or a patron, or both,
###1371 to gain a firm foothold and to really fly.
###1374 While there was grassroots interest in what he had to say,
###1378 it was about 200 years after the Buddha's death that Buddhism got a major boost.
###1383 In 250BC, the ruthless, all-powerful emperor Ashoka,
###1388 who controlled most of ancient India,
###1390 proved Buddhism's greatest ally.
###1396 Ashoka was haunted by the memory of the blood that he'd acquired
###1401 on his hands as a result of the cut and thrust of his rise to power
###1405 and he decided to turn to "the good"
###1408 and in order to realize that ambition
###1411 he vigorously promoted Buddhist ideals
###1414 right across the Indian subcontinent.
###1418 According to Buddhist tradition,
###1420 in the centuries following Ashoka's
###1422 sponsorship of Buddha's ideas,
###1424 the philosophy evolved into
###1426 at least 18 different schools.
###1428 One of these, the Theravada,
###1430 still survives today
###1431 and is mainly associated
###1433 with south and southeast Asia.
###1435 Another came to be called
###1437 the Mahayana,
###1438 the "Great Vehicle" or "Way",
###1440 now most often found in north and east Asia.
###1445 Ashoka, by embracing Buddhism,
###1447 put a particular emphasis on the consequences of his actions,
###1451 on what he thought and how he lived in the world.
###1454 On his Karma.
###1457 Karma is a word well known in the west today.
###1460 It has its roots in early Indian belief systems,
###1463 but the value of Karma became
###1466 a fundamentally important
###1468 Buddhist concept,
###1470 and one that I am going to explore
###1472 at...
###1476 ..our next wonder of the Buddhist world.
###1494 Sri Lankan Buddhists believe that the tooth relic
###1497 was brought to their country around 300 BC.
###1501 Safeguarding the relic became the responsibility of kings
###1504 and over the years, the custodianship of the relic
###1508 came to symbolize the right to rule.
###1515 The Buddha is said to have given two legacies to future generations -
###1520 the body of his teachings, the Dharma,
###1523 and also relics of his physical body itself,
###1527 which are now scattered in shrines right across the globe,
###1531 and one of the most precious is kept in here, in the Temple of the Tooth.
###1540 That relic makes the presence of the Buddha more graphic to people,
###1544 so it gives them a power.
###1545 Actually, many Buddhist temples around the world have relics,
###1549 a piece of bone or something,
###1552 just as in Europe, you have relics of saints,
###1554 so it's a way of making the person's presence feel more immediate.
###1558 That gives the temple more power, as a magnet to draw the worshipper.
###1564 The shrine stands right at the centre of a paved courtyard.
###1568 The ceiling is decorated with moonstones and floral designs.
###1576 There are ivory reliefs on the doorways.
###1581 The inner chamber contains the tooth relic and other sacred objects
###1587 and all around there is a brightly painted corridor.
###1602 DRUMMING AND WIND INSTRUMENT
###1610 Monks conduct daily worship in the inner chamber of the temple.
###1615 Rituals are performed at dawn, at noon and in the evening.
###1622 The tooth is in this upper chamber in a casket of gold
###1626 and is only revealed to a chosen few.
###1631 The sacred relic is symbolically bathed
###1633 with an herbal preparation made from scented water and fragrant flowers.
###1640 This holy water is believed to contain healing properties
###1643 and is distributed among those present.
###1650 Once a week, mothers gather at the temple with their babies.
###1656 All these little babies are waiting to be taken in to be blessed by the priests
###1660 so that they have Buddha's power with them for the rest of their lives.
###1664 They're given a white piece of string to wrap around their wrist
###1668 which shows that the Buddha is with them from now until they die.
###1671 It's thought incredibly important that they get the blessing at this early stage
###1675 because everything that they do from now on,
###1679 all their intentional actions,
###1681 what they think, what they say and what they do, their karma,
###1684 will affect how they are then reborn in the next life.
###1689 Karma is one of the main concepts of Buddhism.
###1693 It is the belief that any of our intentional actions, both thought and deed,
###1697 will be mirrored by something similar happening to us in future.
###1701 So, if you harm someone, someone will harm you.
###1706 This principle of cause and effect can bring consequences
###1709 that are either good or bad depending on what it is you've done.
###1713 Because Buddhists believe we have many lives, this good and bad karma
###1718 can generate consequences both throughout this life and long into the next.
###1725 Karma is what you do. The word literally means deed or action.
###1732 But the Buddha said
###1733 that all Karma that matters
###1735 is what is morally good or morally bad,
###1739 and you decide what to do.
###1743 Now, we must remember that for Buddhists,
###1747 your life goes on beyond what we normally think of as this life.
###1752 In fact, you are reborn an infinite number of times
###1757 until you manage to bring that to an end.
###1764 Buddhists use a metaphor to help explain what karma is.
###1768 They say that if you sow thistle seed,
###1770 then you can't expect apple trees to grow,
###1773 and that is very clear. It's a basic principle of cause and effect
###1778 and as a historian, I know that that principle has real validity.
###1783 We are all affected by our past
###1786 and our past and our present together informs our future
###1790 so when the Buddha said
###1792 that we should be mindful of our intentional actions, of our karma
###1797 and that our highest authority is our conscience,
###1800 than he was making real sense
###1802 and he was also clarifying something about what it is to be human.
###1813 Of course, the issue is that karma can be both good and bad.
###1818 And in Sri Lanka, the fallout of action and reaction,
###1821 of cause and effect, has been brutally tested in recent years.
###1826 For nearly three decades,
###1828 the country has been locked in a violent civil war,
###1832 in which close on 100,000 people have been killed.
###1836 Sri Lanka is only now emerging from this debilitating conflict
###1840 between the Hindu Tamil minority and a Buddhist Singhalese majority.
###1846 The Temple of the Tooth was badly hit
###1848 and partially destroyed during the war.
###1851 It has now been fully restored.
###1854 Buddhists believe this cycle of death and destruction can be broken.
###1860 They assert that by following a certain path, it is possible
###1863 to break out of a continuous round of life and death and rebirth,
###1868 which in Buddhism has a name.
###1871 Samsara.
###1872 And Samsara is the concept I am going to investigate now
###1876 as I move to the next wonder of the Buddhist world.
###1887 Once Buddhist ideas had flourished in Sri Lanka,
###1890 Sri Lankan monarchs sent emissaries to adjoining kingdoms
###1893 in southeast Asia to carry
###1896 the Buddhist message.
###1898 By the 11th century,
###1899 Theravadin Buddhism was well established in Thailand
###1903 and here in Bangkok, close on 90% of Thais are now Buddhist.
###1908 The reason that Buddhism has thrived so vigorously
###1911 and tenaciously here is because right from its very outset,
###1916 it's had the support of the Thai kings.
###1919 A king here can aspire to be a Buddha himself
###1922 and there is one king who was actually a monk for 25 years
###1925 before he came to the throne.
###1928 Every time the royal family builds a new palace for itself,
###1931 it will also constructs next door a monastery and a temple complex
###1935 as a kind of outward sign of its righteousness
###1938 and commitment to the Buddhist cause
###1941 and here in Bangkok, the temple complex is certainly fit for a king.
###1949 This is Wat Pho, our next wonder of the Buddhist world.
###1954 It's the largest and oldest temple complex in Bangkok.
###1959 It's home to more than 1,000 Buddha images.
###1963 The complex includes a temple, a working monastery
###1966 and a large courtyard with a forest of stupas,
###1969 thick with exquisite hand-made lotus motifs.
###1975 And hidden within its own palatial hall...
###1979 the golden reclining Buddha.
###1990 The gold Buddha is 141ft long
###1993 and 49ft high.
###1997 Started in 1788, it took over five years to build.
###2015 This one of the most stunning, gobsmacking
###2019 works of monumental art I have ever seen.
###2021 I have to say I love its audacity,
###2025 I love the fact that it says,
###2026 "Look at me, look at what mankind can do
###2029 "when he manipulates raw materials to create a thing of beauty,"
###2033 because here there are thousands of fragments of mother-of-pearl used
###2036 and a 153 plates of gold,
###2040 but what it doesn't seem to me to say
###2044 is that this is an incarnation of the Middle Path,
###2048 that essential Buddhist notion that extremes and excesses
###2052 should be avoided at all costs
###2054 because there is no doubt that this is a thing of opulence.
###2058 It's enormous, it's gorgeous
###2061 and it's very sensuous.
###2066 In history of Thailand there are a lot of large-scale
###2071 reclining Buddhas built all over central part of Thailand,
###2077 because to build a reclining Buddha, it's not a very easy process
###2084 because most of the reclining Buddha is not made from casting
###2090 it's made from bricks, plaster, or cement.
###2095 It's considered very respectful image,
###2099 so it must be decorated with very valuable materials
###2105 and, of course, the most valuable materials
###2109 for decorating the image of Lord Buddha should be gold.
###2115 Gold in Buddhism symbolizes the sun, or fire.
###2119 The most valuable of metals, it is accorded a sacred status
###2122 through its association with Surya, the sun god of the Hindu pantheon.
###2127 For Buddhists in Thailand, and other South Asian countries,
###2131 gold is an element that signifies homage.
###2134 A gift of gold is the ultimate demonstration of one's piety.
###2141 The meritorious act of putting gold leaf
###2143 on the surface of a Buddha's skin
###2146 is to commemorate the living Buddha,
###2149 who had a golden-like aura, a radiance, they believe.
###2153 But gold and its association with wealth and might
###2157 is also the way Thai monarchs have used a showy form of piety
###2161 to forge a strong relationship between Buddha's ideas
###2165 and the power of the state.
###2169 It was King Rama III
###2170 who had the statue of the reclining Buddha opulently restored
###2173 at the height of his reign in the mid-19th century.
###2178 It's called the Lion Pose,
###2179 so, as he lay there in the lion pose as he was preparing to die.
###2185 It's described that he lay down on his right side
###2188 and he rested his head on his right hand.
###2194 There is a reason that this Buddha has got such a serene smile -
###2197 it's because he has achieved enlightenment, Nirvana.
###2201 It means that he has escaped what Buddhists call Samsara,
###2206 an endless cycle of life, of birth and death,
###2209 of passion and desire and delusion,
###2213 that can only lead to pain and suffering.
###2221 Samsara effectively constitutes a cycle of birth and re-birth,
###2226 and as long as we are in Samsara we are born innumerable times
###2230 and moving from one existence to the next.
###2233 We can be re-born as a human being, as a divinity,
###2236 or you can be re-born as an animal, etc.
###2243 'Tell me what you think Samsara is?'
###2245 For me it's not just a physical picture
###2250 of, you know, the circle of being born and ageing and dying,
###2254 for me it has something to do with the state of mind as well.
###2259 That you have to deal with your bad emotions if you have problems,
###2265 if you're suffering, you have... feel frustrated,
###2268 you don't know how to deal with it,
###2270 but this is just a small sample of bad things that happen to you,
###2273 just keep go on and on and on, can find a real peace or happiness.
###2280 The wheel of life is a common visual depiction in Buddhism.
###2284 At the time Buddha started to teach,
###2286 many understood life as a relentless cycle,
###2289 where all were born, grew old, died and were re-born in another life.
###2294 It was an eternal morass, from which there was no release,
###2299 but Buddha felt that an escape was possible.
###2302 He taught that through one's actions, karma, and through a way of life
###2306 that was characterized by wisdom, morality and compassion,
###2310 via meditation and the triumph of the mind over craving, desire and excess,
###2314 it was possible to achieve enlightenment, Nirvana.
###2321 He believed that this enlightenment would empower ordinary people
###2325 to break free from Samsara.
###2328 THEY CHANT
###2330 This idea gives Buddhist funerals a distinctive character.
###2333 Those present mourn their loss,
###2337 but also hope that, thanks to their beloved's good karma,
###2340 the dead are at least one step closer to enlightenment,
###2344 that they have the chance of a re-birth as a better being
###2348 who one day can escape Samsara.
###2355 What goes around comes around, and that's what I believe,
###2358 this body is just like a house that we rent for a while.
###2362 After we die we have to find a new place to live,
###2366 it's impermanent, it's just temporary.
###2368 So, good Buddhists believe that we should do our best in this life
###2372 to guarantee a better place after we die.
###2394 Buddhists say that there is only one certain way
###2397 to break free from Samsara,
###2400 to eliminate the desires, and the passions,
###2403 and the distractions of everyday life.
###2407 Now, of course, that is very easy to say and it's very hard to do,
###2411 so over the centuries Buddhists have employed specific rigorous methods
###2416 to break free from all of this,
###2418 from the troubles and the temptations of the real world,
###2421 and to set themselves on the path to enlightenment, to Nirvana,
###2426 and that is the truly radical thing about the Buddha's example,
###2431 his belief that each and every one of us
###2434 has the capacity to achieve liberation,
###2437 to achieve our own enlightenment.
###2443 It took the Buddha years to arrive at this radical belief.
###2447 Ideas he developed through his own personal experience -
###2451 in particular, an intense form of meditation.
###2455 And it is Buddhist meditation that I'm now going to experience
###2459 in our next wonder of the Buddhist world.
###2464 Buddhism continued to spread throughout the Mediaeval period.
###2467 Come the 13th century
###2468 and Buddhism was flourishing in the Khmer Kingdom...
###2472 modern-day Cambodia.
###2475 The temple complexes here at Angkor are our fifth wonder.
###2482 Angkor Wat began life as the sacred palace complex
###2485 of a Khmer Emperor who, in fact, favoured Hinduism
###2488 over Buddhist ideas.
###2492 These aren't just buildings, but have a grand ambition.
###2497 The whole complex is said to be a symbolic representation
###2500 of Hindu cosmology.
###2508 The original temple honoured the Hindu god Vishnu
###2512 and incarnates the centre of the physical and spiritual universe,
###2516 a mythical mountain.
###2521 A series of five rectangular walls represent other mountains
###2525 and the moats here evoke the cosmic ocean.
###2540 This place reeks of a combination of earthly and divine power,
###2547 and of the close-knit relationship between gods and kings.
###2552 And, of course, it was a belief in that relationship
###2554 that inspired the creation of this complex in the first place,
###2558 but for some people it was just TOO exclusive,
###2562 too strictly hierarchical...
###2565 and Buddhism offered a solution.
###2568 It was the Khmer Emperor Jayavarman VII who converted to Buddhism
###2574 and his regime marked a clear dividing line
###2576 with the old Hindu past.
###2579 Before 1200, art in the temples mostly portrayed scenes from the Hindu pantheon.
###2584 After his conversion, Buddhist scenes began to appear as standard motifs.
###2590 During his reign, there was a focus on building libraries,
###2593 monastic dwellings, public works, and more "earthly" projects,
###2597 accessible to the common people.
###2600 So history in Cambodia takes a humanist turn
###2604 and as Buddhism rises in popularity,
###2607 you find images of the Buddha and his followers emerging everywhere in the architecture...
###2612 in gates, in walls and in temples.
###2616 So now Angkor is showing the world a more human face.
###2623 The Angkor complex is a prime example of the classical style of Khmer architecture.
###2629 By the 12th century,
###2630 Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in masonry,
###2634 facing the monuments with intricate sandstone blocks.
###2639 Angkor Wat is famous for the harmony of its world-class design.
###2644 Architecturally, towers shaped like lotus buds are characteristic.
###2650 Half-galleries broaden the passageways,
###2652 other galleries connect enclosures
###2655 and terraces appear along the main pathways of the temple.
###2659 The walls are decorated with bas-reliefs
###2662 showing Hindu mythological figures and detailed narrative scenes.
###2669 This one depicts the churning of the oceans.
###2675 Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting
###2678 and the passage of time.
###2680 They included gilded stucco, gold on some figures,
###2685 and elaborate carved ceiling panels and doors.
###2689 This was the largest sacred building in the world.
###2693 Although there is an eerie, crumbling beauty to this place now,
###2698 you have to imagine it in its heyday.
###2702 All this stonework would have been brightly painted
###2705 and in this corridor there would have been many hundreds of statues of the Buddha,
###2709 wrought out of precious gold.
###2712 The light from the statues would have been reflected back from the walls,
###2716 which would have been studded with emeralds and sapphires and rubies,
###2721 and outside there would have been crowds of monks,
###2724 their eyes closed in meditation,
###2727 their faces lit by the glow of torches made out of jungle resin.
###2734 Since Buddhism is primarily an educational system,
###2738 meditation is a key component of that educational system.
###2743 Meditation is the way you become viscerally and directly aware
###2747 of all these deep connections and connectivenesses to the universe,
###2750 and you have to become directly aware of it
###2752 to become free of being controlled by unconscious processes.
###2757 And that freedom is liberation, that freedom is Nirvana.
###2762 I'd been invited by a group of trainee Buddhist monks
###2765 to experience meditation for myself.
###2769 Members of the Sangha can spend hours each day meditating.
###2775 The way they sit, the position of their hands,
###2778 is copied from the practice of the Buddha himself.
###2782 They are still and concentrate on their breathing...
###2786 not doing anything to alter the way they breathe,
###2789 not worrying about whether they're doing it right or wrong,
###2793 clearing their minds of thoughts, of feelings, of fear and anger...
###2798 of the distractions of the outside world.
###2801 Just following the breathing and becoming one with each breath.
###2812 I can't say I've managed to completely block out the sound of the world going on
###2817 and it feels hard to stay this still for so long,
###2821 but if someone were to ask me if I had any anger in my head or my heart right now,
###2828 I would have to say there is none.
###2840 The Pali Canon advises that there are particularly good places to meditate -
###2845 a mountain, a hillside, a rock cave, a cemetery,
###2850 an open field, an open forest,
###2853 the root of a tree,
###2855 deep in the jungle.
###2857 And this place certainly fits some of those criteria,
###2860 but I have to say,
###2862 I'm probably going to carry on meditating in my own sweet way for a while.
###2866 I am not quite ready yet to do the deep breathing
###2869 and the lotus position.
###2871 But still I have huge respect for the practice of meditation,
###2875 not least because it is a firm vote of confidence
###2878 in the power of the human mind.
###2881 It suggests that in order to transcend the difficulties of this world,
###2885 we don't just need to appeal to a higher, divine authority...
###2890 but to look to our own consciousness.
###2895 Well, certainly the people of Cambodia have had more cause than most
###2900 to find internal resources to deal with the troubles that the world has thrown at them.
###2905 Cambodia has suffered some of the worst violence and genocide of the last century.
###2912 Between 1968 and 1976, over 3 million Cambodians were killed
###2916 in the war that engulfed Vietnam and other countries of southeast Asia.
###2922 This was then followed by the terror and genocide
###2925 unleashed by the Khmer Rouge,
###2927 a communist movement that ruled Cambodia for four years.
###2935 The Khmer Rouge dealt particularly viciously with Buddhism.
###2939 Thousands of monks were slaughtered and monasteries were destroyed
###2943 and if people tried to hold on to their beliefs,
###2945 they were often tortured and killed.
###2949 But gradually, as the nightmare is beginning to fade,
###2953 Buddhism is finding its feet here again and when you come to Angkor,
###2957 you'll find little active shrines like this tucked away into corners.
###2964 In Cambodia, Buddhism is slowly reasserting itself.
###2968 This country, which had experienced such horrors, is now peaceful
###2973 and Angkor, which had been brutalized
###2976 by the Khmer Rouge regime,
###2978 is now a world tourist site once again.
###2981 It's been very moving coming here to Cambodia
###2984 because this place has been the home
###2987 to the most dramatic twists and turns in the fortunes of Buddhism.
###2992 For centuries, Buddhism was the philosophy of choice,
###2995 for both the kings and the people,
###2998 and then thanks to the horrors of the Khmer Rouge,
###3001 there was a chance that it was going to be eradicated
###3004 virtually overnight.
###3006 But gradually, gently, it is now making a comeback
###3011 and there's even a possibility that this place,
###3014 which was once the biggest and most active Buddhist complex in the world,
###3020 could be that again, some time in the future.
###3027 While in Cambodia Buddhism is emerging out of the darkness of the Khmer Rouge regime,
###3033 Buddhism in mainland China, and here in Hong Kong,
###3036 is also reasserting itself,
###3039 an ancient tradition reappearing in modern society.
###3045 Buddhism is on the rise once again,
###3047 partly perhaps because its positive attitude feels well-suited to an emerging superpower.
###3054 Particularly popular is the Zen form of Buddhism.
###3057 Little surprise given that Zen,
###3060 although now typically associated with Japan,
###3064 started off life in China.
###3066 And I'm going to explore Zen
###3068 in one of the places in the world where it is most vigorous...
###3073 Hong Kong.
###3075 Our sixth wonder is the giant Buddha that overlooks
###3079 this great Asian city.
###3083 This mammoth bronze statue was completed in 1993.
###3087 It symbolises the relationship between man and nature,
###3091 people and religion.
###3093 The building of the giant Buddha in Hong Kong
###3096 was a reassertion of an old Buddhist tradition
###3099 of constructing massive Buddhist images.
###3102 And the monks who initiated the project in Hong Kong
###3107 had visited Japan, and they'd visited various sites in mainland China
###3110 and seen medieval massive images of Buddhas,
###3114 and this was something they were trying to re-create in Lantan.
###3118 It's the only statue of Buddha to face north towards Beijing,
###3123 and is named Tian Tan after the Temple of Heaven in that city.
###3131 When Buddhism first starts out, it seems that people actively
###3135 choose not to represent the Buddha figuratively.
###3139 But then as the philosophy passes through regions like Afghanistan,
###3143 which had a really strong Greek influence
###3146 thanks to the invasion of Alexander the Great,
###3149 it becomes the done thing to represent the Buddha in human form.
###3154 Now, once the belief system enters China,
###3157 a new tradition gains popularity.
###3160 Not just to represent the Buddha in human form,
###3164 but to do so on a monumental scale.
###3168 And that's an art form that's now being revived here in Hong Kong.
###3180 Everything about this statue means something.
###3183 The Buddha is sitting in a lotus position,
###3185 which shows that he was like the beauty of a lotus flower
###3189 emerging from the muddy waters of a pond.
###3193 His face is that beautiful round shape, which is supposed to be a reflection
###3198 of the perfection of the moon.
###3200 And his head is domed, which tells us just how wise he is.
###3204 His hands are interesting
###3206 because the right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing.
###3209 This is the Buddha's vow that he will release the entire world from its suffering.
###3215 And on his chest he's got that so-called Swastika symbol.
###3219 Of course the Swastika was unfortunately appropriated by the Nazis,
###3223 even though they got it the wrong way round.
###3225 But what it actually means is the power of the universe,
###3230 so this tells us that the Buddha's compassion and wisdom
###3233 is available to all.
###3240 The Buddha statue sits on a lotus throne
###3244 on top of an altar.
###3247 It's surrounded by six smaller bronze statues.
###3250 They're shown offering gifts like fruit and incense,
###3253 gifts that symbolise different aspects of Buddhist philosophy,
###3257 all virtues which are necessary to achieve enlightenment.
###3271 The giant Buddha is part of the Po Lin monastery and temple complex
###3275 set up nearly 100 years ago by three Zen masters.
###3280 Zen has developed as a part of Mahayana Buddhism,
###3285 the school of Buddhism practised in China
###3287 and other northern Asian countries.
###3289 Zen Buddhists believe that all people have the qualities that the Buddha had,
###3294 and emphasise that these can be developed and were not unique to the Buddha only.
###3311 The aim of Zen is to discover this quality within each person,
###3315 through meditation and practice of the Buddha's teachings.
###3321 The ultimate goal is to become a completely enlightened Buddha.
###3329 Meditation has always been central to Buddhism,
###3333 but here in China a new brand of meditation was born,
###3337 and it took its name from a Sanskrit word Dhyana which is actually very hard to translate,
###3343 but it means a kind of alert, productive state of mind.
###3348 In China it was called Chan
###3349 and when it travels to Japan it becomes Zen.
###3356 It's a school of Buddhism which lays enormous emphasis on certain kinds of meditative practice.
###3364 What you try to do is purely to empty your mind.
###3369 It has an ideology that rational thought is not going to get you to enlightenment or Nirvana.
###3379 It's practised here in a small secluded monastery, minutes away from the giant Buddha.
###3386 Formal silent meditation is central to Zen
###3391 and is practised by both the laity and the ordained together.
###3398 Some people find the concept of Zen quite difficult to grasp.
###3404 How would you define it?
###3405 So Zen means we never separate our life and our practice.
###3409 Zen is like 24 hours when you are standing,
###3414 sitting, walking, lying down, so never separate.
###3420 You know, our everyday life and our practice cannot separate, it's not two things.
###3425 Zen also means inside, inside, you know, our mind,
###3429 and outside objects, inside and outside both become one, that's Zen.
###3440 So if you're not making that separation between Zen practice and everyday life,
###3445 does that mean that when you do everything, when you sweep the floor
###3449 or prepare food or clean something, that is an act of Zen itself?
###3456 Zen means what are you doing now, you know.
###3459 So somebody might get enlightenment while they are eating meal,
###3463 washing bowl, all these were designed to help people be in the moment
###3470 and maybe at that moment your mind becomes clear and your life becomes clear.
###3475 THUNDER RUMBLES
###3515 This is called water bowl meditation
###3519 and the purpose is to carry the water without spilling a drop.
###3522 The idea is that you can do this through the application of Zen,
###3525 because if you think you're carrying a bowl of water, you're bound to shake and lose some
###3531 but if you clear your mind completely, you will complete the task successfully.
###3542 In the West a lot of people have heard of Zen. It's something that is quite popular.
###3547 Do you think that's partly because people's lives are so demanding
###3551 and Zen offers a way out from that?
###3554 Not only the West are very busy, now Asia is more busy! It's true!
###3559 It's very money-oriented, everybody worry about the living,
###3565 so it's very important our mind know how to relax
###3570 and to be living at this moment and to keep clear.
###3573 If you can live in this present, even if some problem appear, it's OK.
###3579 You have this clear mind and you are not agitated.
###3583 I think these are very important practice for everybody.
###3596 Zen practitioners today don't like to use specific words to limit what Zen is,
###3602 but if you want to find a definition for the practice, probably as close as you'll get
###3606 is that this is something that really believes in the power of intuition
###3611 and in a productive simplicity.
###3615 I can see that cherishing intuition, living for the moment, living day by day,
###3620 with a clear mind, is a very productive way to spend your time.
###3625 Perhaps it explains why of all brands of Buddhism, Zen has become particularly attractive
###3631 to those who live in our demanding 21st century.
###3646 Zen, and its ancestor Chan,
###3649 is a very practical form of Buddhist wisdom.
###3651 It encourages a process of rediscovery by living simply.
###3658 The Zen tradition emphasises that enlightenment is possible here and now.
###3665 Is it then very different from other forms of Buddhism?
###3669 Zen means pointing directly to our mind, it means right now wake up,
###3676 and be clear, what are you doing now.
###3678 Actually, our mind is not complicated.
###3681 It is our thinking with our life that is very complicated.
###3685 So Zen is a tool to help us to bring back our mind to our everyday life and be simple.
###3694 Zen, like all Buddhist practice, turns philosophy into a tool to help in day-to-day life.
###3702 Meditation is also used to bring about a tangible outcome,
###3705 either in the understanding of the world or in our ability to deal with it,
###3709 and with the suffering we see all around and feel within us.
###3713 One thing that struck me was that whatever the regional variations of Buddhism,
###3717 issues of suffering are right at the core of the philosophy.
###3723 Now that is really interesting because in general over the last 2,500 years
###3727 the cultures of the East have been very unabashed about suffering,
###3731 they don't mind putting it centre stage.
###3734 Whereas in the West, these are issues that we can sometimes try to brush under the carpet.
###3739 In the modern age, for instance, we've been accused of trying to cheat death itself.
###3745 But just look at that statue,
###3748 there's the Buddha promising to deal with all the suffering in the world.
###3752 So it does make you wonder what future Buddhism has as a global belief system.
###3757 What's going to happen when ideas of the East,
###3760 which put suffering to the fore, start to take root in the West?
###3774 Buddhist ideas and philosophy have become increasingly popular
###3777 in the fast-paced and highly competitive world of California.
###3784 New Age concepts mixed with the counterculture of the hippies in the 1970s
###3788 have made words like Karma and Nirvana commonplace.
###3794 Buddhism offered a spiritual life and an emphasis on morality without being too authoritarian.
###3800 Buddhism initially spread into the West and especially the West Coast of the United States
###3805 in the 19th century, thanks to Japanese and Chinese labourers brought in to work on the railways.
###3811 In Los Angeles, the first Buddhist temples were set up at the turn of the century.
###3817 Today, the city is home
###3818 to one of the largest Buddhist temples in the West.
###3821 Hsi Lai Temple at Hacienda Heights,
###3825 our seventh wonder of the Buddhist world.
###3832 Here I am going to try to understand what has to be the most important Buddhist concept,
###3838 the ultimate goal for Buddhists, Nirvana.
###3848 The planning and construction of the temple in the 1980s
###3850 was met with suspicion and resistance from local communities.
###3855 The building of the temple at its current location survived six public hearings
###3860 and 165 explanatory sessions.
###3863 Finally, in 1985, the temple was granted a building permit.
###3868 It was completed in 1988.
###3874 I tell you what there is definitely a wealth of here, and that is Buddhas.
###3879 I have never seen so many. There must be 10,000 or something.
###3883 Yeah, there are over 10,000 Buddhas here, big and small.
###3886 And if you look at all the Buddhas, you may find some names there.
###3891 It's a Chinese practice that people make an offering
###3895 and then to have the name of the family. It's their Buddha.
###3899 And it's also a form of supporting the temple,
###3902 they come in and say "I have a Buddha in there".
###3905 It's like the connection between the Buddha outside and the Buddha inside.
###3911 One of the many American Buddhists who come to the temple is Mario Cee.
###3915 He became a Buddhist six years ago.
###3921 There are some who'd say that the attraction of Buddhism for many Americans
###3925 is that it's pleasingly mystical, it comes from the East
###3928 but at the same time it ties in with an "anything goes" materialist lifestyle.
###3933 How do you speak to that?
###3935 I don't mean any disrespect by this, but I have some friends
###3939 who use Buddhism and Eastern religion,
###3941 Eastern philosophy, and they mix it up with New Age,
###3944 and that's OK, if it works for them, but my concern is that it is that sort of anything goes,
###3951 you know, it's a free market in spirituality. Whatever I'm saying and thinking today is fine.
###3956 Because we have these core teachings in Buddhism, it keeps us in check,
###3960 so we don't go into anything, "If it feels good, it's OK."
###3964 We're really trying to avoid that.
###3966 Buddhism gave me a discipline without a necessity of a God
###3971 to reward me or punish me.
###3973 There has been a tenfold increase in the number of Buddhists
###3977 in Europe and America over the last 40 years.
###3981 Most observers put the figure at between two to three million practising Buddhists in America,
###3986 with the number of Buddhist "sympathisers" estimated at over 10 million.
###3993 The His Lai temple is one example of the modern expansionism of Buddhism.
###3997 BUDDHIST CHANTING
###4004 Many Buddhists come to the His Lai temple for worship...
###4009 ..others come to practise meditation.
###4016 In the West, there's recently been great interest in yoga,
###4019 simply as a way to keep fit and as a form of meditation.
###4022 Yoga has its roots in Indian traditions that predate both Hinduism and Buddhism
###4028 and it's sometimes used by Hindus to assert mind over matter.
###4034 For Buddhists, yoga's key purpose is to achieve personal enlightenment.
###4042 It is a very ancient philosophy, Buddhism,
###4045 but in some ways do you think it is very suited to American life,
###4049 because it does have this kind of can-do attitude.
###4052 It's very suited to America.
###4056 One reason is that we've been materialistic, we're known for it,
###4062 and I've found in my experience, it doesn't get you where you want to be.
###4066 I can't believe that I'm alone in that, I can't believe that.
###4072 It offers reasons why that is.
###4077 I'm sure other people, like me,
###4080 who can't understand why all this stuff didn't make them happy
###4085 would be looking for something else.
###4087 I'm not surprised that it is popular.
###4093 It's not against any other religion and it's not against science.
###4099 It's very in line with everything.
###4102 The temple then offers American Buddhists lots of reasons to visit.
###4107 But if you're a devotee of Buddhism, then one of your main motivations for coming here
###4112 is to seek enlightenment...
###4115 ..Nirvana.
###4117 I'd love to be able to tell you that I've got a textbook definition for what Nirvana is,
###4122 but considering the Buddha himself said it was beyond words, beyond logic,
###4127 I suspect it is going to be quite a tricky concept to pin down.
###4133 Nirvana certainly is a state of mind,
###4136 and it's a state of mind
###4138 in which you have abolished strong emotions
###4141 of very much wanting things
###4144 or very much hating things or being confused.
###4148 It's a state of mind which you attain, and, at that moment, and thereafter,
###4155 you will enjoy a kind of blissful calm.
###4160 And that path, is the end of that path, Nirvana, is that your goal?
###4165 Yes, Nirvana, enlightenment, full understanding, awakening.
###4171 Those are all terms that are very similar and, to me, it's understanding the truth,
###4176 understanding what this is, what it really is.
###4181 How confident are you that Nirvana is a goal you are going to attain?
###4184 I am cautiously optimistic - how about that?
###4189 There are people that say that it's very possible,
###4193 and these are people that are very smart people and I'm following their advice
###4197 and I think it can be done. I think it can be done.
###4207 Like so much in Buddhism, Nirvana clearly has to be experienced, not explained.
###4213 But for Buddhists, the journey to get there, the path you take,
###4217 seems to be as important as the arriving.
###4223 Buddhists will tell you that Nirvana has no fixed point in time or space.
###4229 That's actually a little ironic because one of the few accepted fixtures of the Buddhist story
###4234 is where the Buddha himself found enlightenment.
###4238 We're told that that took place in Northern India
###4240 under the spreading branches of a peepul tree.
###4248 Which is where my quest had started, at Bodhgaya, at this spot
###4253 where it's said Buddhist philosophy really began 2,500 years ago.
###4259 In this journey I have explored key facets of Buddhist belief
###4262 and got a little closer to understanding something vital
###4266 about the core of Buddhist philosophy, the Dharma.
###4270 The Dharma is simply the way the world is.
###4273 We can all best live our lives if we follow a path
###4276 that allows us to deal with the world as passionately, as compassionately,
###4282 as positively and as wisely as possible.
###4286 Now, whatever the permutations and interpretations of Buddhism,
###4291 that seems to me to be pretty simple and pretty enlightened.
###4296 I've learnt about Karma, how mindful actions impact on our lives,
###4302 about Samsara, the cycle of life, birth and death,
###4305 about meditation, about Zen,
###4310 and the final goal for all Buddhists, Nirvana.
###4314 I have seen some of the most beautiful architecture inspired by Buddhist ideas
###4319 and how, after 25 centuries, Buddhism still attracts millions across the globe.
###4324 A philosophy that is rooted in its ancient past and yet gives character to the modern world.
###4331 How Buddhism places the responsibility to realise the truth on all of us.
###4338 As Buddhism travelled, it transformed the cultures it came into contact with,
###4343 just as it too was transformed.
###4346 You wonder if Buddha could ever possibly have imagined the impact
###4350 that his ideas would have on human history,
###4353 particularly given the one thing he was certain about,
###4356 was that impermanence and change were the only things that were definite in this world.
###4363 Just listen to this - it's one of his most poetic epithets.
###4367 "So shall you think of all this fleeting world.
###4371 "A star at dawn, a bubble in a stream,
###4374 "a flash of lightning in a summer cloud,
###4377 "a flickering lamp, a phantom, and a dream."
###4382 Well, the Buddha's dreams of 2,500 years ago are still with us
###4389 and they've been made incarnate in one of the most tenacious belief systems of all time
###4394 and in some of the most iconic and beautiful monuments in the world.
