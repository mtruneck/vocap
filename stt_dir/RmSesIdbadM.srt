0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,419
JEFF MICHAUD: Did
you get my text?


2
0:0:1,419 --> 0:0:2,365
JEFF BENJAMIN: Which one?


3
0:0:2,365 --> 0:0:4,257
JEFF MICHAUD: We put the
picture of the morels.


4
0:0:4,257 --> 0:0:5,203
JEFF BENJAMIN: The what?


5
0:0:5,203 --> 0:0:5,676
JEFF MICHAUD: Do you get it?


6
0:0:5,676 --> 0:0:6,15
Look at it.


7
0:0:6,15 --> 0:0:6,97
You've got to look at it.


8
0:0:6,97 --> 0:0:9,1
It says the first of
the season morels.


9
0:0:9,1 --> 0:0:12,28
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Oh my God.


10
0:0:12,28 --> 0:0:13,4
Did he see it?


11
0:0:13,4 --> 0:0:13,492
MALE SPEAKER: No.


12
0:0:13,492 --> 0:0:14,468
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: dude.


13
0:0:14,468 --> 0:0:16,42
MARC VETRI: First of
the season morels.


14
0:0:16,42 --> 0:0:18,372
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: the
season morels.


15
0:0:18,372 --> 0:0:24,47



16
0:0:24,47 --> 0:0:26,582
That is the funniest thing
I've ever seen.


17
0:0:26,582 --> 0:0:37,89



18
0:0:37,89 --> 0:0:40,81
JEFF MICHAUD: Get me set
up for pip pot pie.


19
0:0:40,81 --> 0:0:42,13
Give me the container,
give me the pot


20
0:0:42,13 --> 0:0:43,89
pie, give me the dough.


21
0:0:43,89 --> 0:0:48,23
My name is Jeff Michaud, and I
cook at Alla Spina restaurant.


22
0:0:48,23 --> 0:0:51,6
Alla Spina is our Italian
gastropub.


23
0:0:51,6 --> 0:0:54,38
We're known for our craft beers,
whether they're Italian


24
0:0:54,38 --> 0:0:57,0
or from Europe or local.


25
0:0:57,0 --> 0:0:59,33
And then we're also known
for our fun twists


26
0:0:59,33 --> 0:1:1,816
on Italian bar food.


27
0:1:1,816 --> 0:1:4,3
Ready for the pot pie magic?


28
0:1:4,3 --> 0:1:11,5
This is pot pie 2012.


29
0:1:11,5 --> 0:1:13,34
That half a bowl?


30
0:1:13,34 --> 0:1:14,485
Way too much verona.


31
0:1:14,485 --> 0:1:16,65
Ask him what he thinks.


32
0:1:16,65 --> 0:1:18,13
MARC VETRI: The [INAUDIBLE]
is nice with the verona.


33
0:1:18,13 --> 0:1:20,17
JEFF MICHAUD: My partners Marc
and Jeff go [INAUDIBLE]


34
0:1:20,17 --> 0:1:22,6
Italy every year, we take
a couple trips.


35
0:1:22,6 --> 0:1:25,27
So we started visiting these
Italian bars and we saw some


36
0:1:25,27 --> 0:1:27,71
that had crazy graffiti
all over the walls.


37
0:1:27,71 --> 0:1:29,13
And the Italian beer
movement was


38
0:1:29,13 --> 0:1:30,38
really starting to develop.


39
0:1:30,38 --> 0:1:32,89
So we came back and like there's
nothing really in the


40
0:1:32,89 --> 0:1:34,0
States that's like this.


41
0:1:34,0 --> 0:1:36,62
So we had to do our version
of Italian gastropub.


42
0:1:36,62 --> 0:1:38,48
We'll be a trendsetter
for the States.


43
0:1:38,48 --> 0:1:42,5



44
0:1:42,5 --> 0:1:43,91
MALE SPEAKER: You want
one of these.


45
0:1:43,91 --> 0:1:45,52
I'm going to tell you, you
want one of these.


46
0:1:45,52 --> 0:1:47,87
JEFF MICHAUD: As far as our
clientele goes, they


47
0:1:47,87 --> 0:1:49,61
love what we do.


48
0:1:49,61 --> 0:1:52,91
They look for that as kind of
off the wall weird stuff that


49
0:1:52,91 --> 0:1:54,73
we got going on.


50
0:1:54,73 --> 0:1:57,98
We kind of wanted to do a little
twist on a hot dog.


51
0:1:57,98 --> 0:1:59,6
So we made a Mortadella
hot dog.


52
0:1:59,6 --> 0:2:1,86
Same filling that you would make
Mortadella with, except


53
0:2:1,86 --> 0:2:4,81
we stuff it in sheep
milk casings.


54
0:2:4,81 --> 0:2:7,764
I don't care who you are,
Pepperidge Farm hot dog roll,


55
0:2:7,764 --> 0:2:9,125
it's the only way to go.


56
0:2:9,125 --> 0:2:11,98



57
0:2:11,98 --> 0:2:14,32
The most important thing about a
hot dog is to have that snap


58
0:2:14,32 --> 0:2:16,43
when you bite into it.


59
0:2:16,43 --> 0:2:18,71
Some of the highlights on the
Alla Spina menu are the veal


60
0:2:18,71 --> 0:2:21,957
breast millinae de Hogie, and
we do our Italian version of


61
0:2:21,957 --> 0:2:24,6
poutine with guinea hen bone
[INAUDIBLE] on top and


62
0:2:24,6 --> 0:2:25,26
mozzarella curd.


63
0:2:25,26 --> 0:2:28,11
And we do a whole pig's head.


64
0:2:28,11 --> 0:2:30,728
We use a lot of pig here,
everything but the oink.


65
0:2:30,728 --> 0:2:32,216
Did you get my text today?


66
0:2:32,216 --> 0:2:32,712
MARC VETRI: Yeah.


67
0:2:32,712 --> 0:2:34,696
JEFF MICHAUD: Did you
open up the picture?


68
0:2:34,696 --> 0:2:36,184
MARC VETRI: Yeah.


69
0:2:36,184 --> 0:2:36,68
JEFF MICHAUD: Ready?


70
0:2:36,68 --> 0:2:38,27
You're killing me, dude.


71
0:2:38,27 --> 0:2:41,77
Last night to go out, I picked
Steve Wildy and Jeff Benjamin.


72
0:2:41,77 --> 0:2:44,96
Steve Wildy is the beverage
director of the whole company


73
0:2:44,96 --> 0:2:47,63
and Jeff Benjamin is
one of the owners.


74
0:2:47,63 --> 0:2:48,61
We always get together.


75
0:2:48,61 --> 0:2:50,35
We go out and have a drink
every now and then.


76
0:2:50,35 --> 0:2:51,47
And we have some cool
late night spots


77
0:2:51,47 --> 0:2:52,795
that we like to hit.


78
0:2:52,795 --> 0:2:53,846
JEFF BENJAMIN: Is that
like "Cash Cab"?


79
0:2:53,846 --> 0:2:56,25
MALE SPEAKER: What is the best
barbecue in Philadelphia?


80
0:2:56,25 --> 0:2:57,58
JEFF MICHAUD: Percy Street.


81
0:2:57,58 --> 0:3:2,18



82
0:3:2,18 --> 0:3:3,936
I think it's one of
those hidden gems.


83
0:3:3,936 --> 0:3:7,0
Like when you come in to Philly
and then don't expect


84
0:3:7,0 --> 0:3:9,24
to find really awesome
barbecue joints


85
0:3:9,24 --> 0:3:10,51
and they do it well.


86
0:3:10,51 --> 0:3:12,5
They don't do the Southern style
where they rub it with


87
0:3:12,5 --> 0:3:13,4
the barbecue sauce.


88
0:3:13,4 --> 0:3:16,0
They do it with the gyro,
the Texas style.


89
0:3:16,0 --> 0:3:22,188



90
0:3:22,188 --> 0:3:23,14
MALE SPEAKER: What'd you do?


91
0:3:23,14 --> 0:3:25,895
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Fox 29 News,
brand new mandolin,


92
0:3:25,895 --> 0:3:28,435
sliced the tip of my fucking
finger off three


93
0:3:28,435 --> 0:3:29,452
seconds into the show.


94
0:3:29,452 --> 0:3:32,76
Dude, it looks like half a clove
of garlic on the other


95
0:3:32,76 --> 0:3:33,18
side of the mandolin.


96
0:3:33,18 --> 0:3:34,72
MALE SPEAKER: Maybe they'll
start using mandolins for


97
0:3:34,72 --> 0:3:35,22
brises now.


98
0:3:35,22 --> 0:3:36,16
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Oh my God.


99
0:3:36,16 --> 0:3:39,71
You'd feel no pain, they'd
be so fucking sharp.


100
0:3:39,71 --> 0:3:40,72
JEFF MICHAUD: Me and
Michael have known


101
0:3:40,72 --> 0:3:41,43
each other for years.


102
0:3:41,43 --> 0:3:44,6
He actually, before I moved to
Italy, he took my spot at


103
0:3:44,6 --> 0:3:46,9
Vetri and we worked together
for about two


104
0:3:46,9 --> 0:3:48,2
years before I left.


105
0:3:48,2 --> 0:3:50,34
He was my bitch.


106
0:3:50,34 --> 0:3:53,35
Thousands of dollars
spent on labelling.


107
0:3:53,35 --> 0:3:54,61
Your chicken, how long's
it cook for?


108
0:3:54,61 --> 0:3:56,422
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Chicken
smokes, I believe, for under


109
0:3:56,422 --> 0:3:58,234
an hour-- probably
about 45 minutes.


110
0:3:58,234 --> 0:3:59,54
JEFF BENJAMIN: Just smoke,
and that's it?


111
0:3:59,54 --> 0:4:0,964
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Smoke, and
that gives it a glaze, and


112
0:4:0,964 --> 0:4:2,446
then right on the
charcoal grill.


113
0:4:2,446 --> 0:4:5,62
They don't ever do this in
Texas, but we finish all of


114
0:4:5,62 --> 0:4:7,632
our meat on the charcoal.


115
0:4:7,632 --> 0:4:10,548
So it gets the woodsmoke, and
then a finish on the charcoal.


116
0:4:10,548 --> 0:4:12,5
[BURPS]


117
0:4:12,5 --> 0:4:12,97
JEFF BENJAMIN: Nice.


118
0:4:12,97 --> 0:4:15,51
JEFF MICHAUD: He said I had
to burp it to get the


119
0:4:15,51 --> 0:4:17,386
flavor of the beer.


120
0:4:17,386 --> 0:4:18,339
Did you smell it?


121
0:4:18,339 --> 0:4:20,52
STEVE WILDY: [INAUDIBLE].


122
0:4:20,52 --> 0:4:24,59
JEFF MICHAUD: Steve Wildy is a
vegetarian, so that spot he


123
0:4:24,59 --> 0:4:25,92
thought was going to be a
little bit of an issue.


124
0:4:25,92 --> 0:4:30,18
But they have a lot of side
dishes that work for him, so


125
0:4:30,18 --> 0:4:31,17
he had a lot of options.


126
0:4:31,17 --> 0:4:33,72
STEVE WILDY: I always think that
a chef's very immature


127
0:4:33,72 --> 0:4:36,82
and maybe inexperienced if
they take that route--


128
0:4:36,82 --> 0:4:39,82
I just don't serve vegetarians,
I don't do it.


129
0:4:39,82 --> 0:4:41,32
Because they're missing
out on [INAUDIBLE].


130
0:4:41,32 --> 0:4:42,82
JEFF MICHAUD: Bourbon,
all right.


131
0:4:42,82 --> 0:4:43,82
Now we're home.


132
0:4:43,82 --> 0:4:44,82
JEFF BENJAMIN: Now we're home.


133
0:4:44,82 --> 0:4:46,7
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
I'm driving.


134
0:4:46,7 --> 0:4:48,82



135
0:4:48,82 --> 0:4:50,1
JEFF MICHAUD: This is awesome.


136
0:4:50,1 --> 0:4:50,856
ERIN O'SHEA: Good.


137
0:4:50,856 --> 0:4:53,7
JEFF MICHAUD: The best turkey
ass we've ever had.


138
0:4:53,7 --> 0:4:53,52
ERIN O'SHEA: Nice.


139
0:4:53,52 --> 0:4:55,75
JEFF MICHAUD: Turkey ass is like
the little butts on the


140
0:4:55,75 --> 0:4:56,84
end of the turkey.


141
0:4:56,84 --> 0:5:0,52
She chops them off and smokes
them for hours and they get


142
0:5:0,52 --> 0:5:2,36
really tender and
they're moist.


143
0:5:2,36 --> 0:5:4,13
I've never had that before,
it was awesome.


144
0:5:4,13 --> 0:5:6,256
He said hey, Jeff, check
out the first


145
0:5:6,256 --> 0:5:7,65
of the season morels.


146
0:5:7,65 --> 0:5:9,49
ERIN O'SHEA: Oh, shit.


147
0:5:9,49 --> 0:5:11,5
JEFF MICHAUD: You look at it
first, you're like looking at


148
0:5:11,5 --> 0:5:12,75
it and you're like, damn.


149
0:5:12,75 --> 0:5:15,936



150
0:5:15,936 --> 0:5:19,7
When we finish up at Percy
Street Barbecue, we grab Mike


151
0:5:19,7 --> 0:5:22,4
Solomonov and Erin O'Shea, we
hop in the van and we headed


152
0:5:22,4 --> 0:5:23,47
to Pub & Kitchen.


153
0:5:23,47 --> 0:5:24,486
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Let me
help you out, dude.


154
0:5:24,486 --> 0:5:25,438
JEFF MICHAUD: Oh, sorry.


155
0:5:25,438 --> 0:5:26,866
I'm like oh, whoa!


156
0:5:26,866 --> 0:5:28,294
Oh, sorry about that.


157
0:5:28,294 --> 0:5:31,63



158
0:5:31,63 --> 0:5:33,8
Pub & Kitchen is a local bar.


159
0:5:33,8 --> 0:5:35,7
There's a lot of industry
people that go there.


160
0:5:35,7 --> 0:5:38,11
Johnny Mac is the chef and he's
worked with some really


161
0:5:38,11 --> 0:5:39,39
great people.


162
0:5:39,39 --> 0:5:43,1
James Beard is great, food and
wine is great, having chefs


163
0:5:43,1 --> 0:5:45,95
eat your food at midnight is
even better-- then you know it


164
0:5:45,95 --> 0:5:47,2
really matters.


165
0:5:47,2 --> 0:5:49,9



166
0:5:49,9 --> 0:5:52,26
He has one side of it which is
burgers and regular bar food


167
0:5:52,26 --> 0:5:53,96
that you would get anywhere.


168
0:5:53,96 --> 0:5:57,69
And then the other side of it
has a little more refined


169
0:5:57,69 --> 0:6:0,2
stuff like rabbit [INAUDIBLE]
and the whipped goat butter


170
0:6:0,2 --> 0:6:2,2
that we have with the nice
blanched vegetables.


171
0:6:2,2 --> 0:6:7,256



172
0:6:7,256 --> 0:6:10,464
JOHNNY MAC: Some nice, fatty
Rhode Island skate wing here.


173
0:6:10,464 --> 0:6:13,81



174
0:6:13,81 --> 0:6:16,6
I always like to cook skate
the way I cook pancakes.


175
0:6:16,6 --> 0:6:20,79
You let it cook until it
just kind of starts to


176
0:6:20,79 --> 0:6:22,36
bubble on this side.


177
0:6:22,36 --> 0:6:27,493
And then you just baste it, flip
it, kiss it, take it out.


178
0:6:27,493 --> 0:6:29,17
This is solid late
night food, man.


179
0:6:29,17 --> 0:6:32,5
Pickled meat, some nice grains,
a little bit of


180
0:6:32,5 --> 0:6:36,27
vegetables, a good piece of
fish cooked in butter.


181
0:6:36,27 --> 0:6:40,39
Really simple, really easy, not
rewriting anything here.


182
0:6:40,39 --> 0:6:41,81
Fine dining in blue jeans.


183
0:6:41,81 --> 0:6:43,95
We turn the music way
up at night, we turn


184
0:6:43,95 --> 0:6:45,53
the lights way down.


185
0:6:45,53 --> 0:6:47,8
Just trying to make good
food for friends.


186
0:6:47,8 --> 0:6:49,314
JEFF MICHAUD: Did you get
my morel picture?


187
0:6:49,314 --> 0:6:52,646
JOHNNY MAC: Yeah,
looks delicious.


188
0:6:52,646 --> 0:6:55,26
JEFF MICHAUD: Can you feed
me an oyster, Michael?


189
0:6:55,26 --> 0:6:56,93
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Are you ready?


190
0:6:56,93 --> 0:6:57,765
Slowly.


191
0:6:57,765 --> 0:6:59,81
Whoa!


192
0:6:59,81 --> 0:7:2,1
MALE SPEAKER: It puts the
oyster in the mouth.


193
0:7:2,1 --> 0:7:3,9
MALE SPEAKER: Put the fucking
oyster in the mouth.


194
0:7:3,9 --> 0:7:6,11
JEFF MICHAUD: Mike's a lot
fun to go out with.


195
0:7:6,11 --> 0:7:8,487
He just likes to enjoy life
and you get a lot of


196
0:7:8,487 --> 0:7:10,355
laughs out of it.


197
0:7:10,355 --> 0:7:12,335
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Blows me
away when people go to


198
0:7:12,335 --> 0:7:13,325
restaurants and then shit.


199
0:7:13,325 --> 0:7:13,82
I'm like, really?


200
0:7:13,82 --> 0:7:16,3
You're going to shit
in my restaurant?


201
0:7:16,3 --> 0:7:18,864
JEFF MICHAUD: Wow.


202
0:7:18,864 --> 0:7:20,36
Beautiful.


203
0:7:20,36 --> 0:7:23,35
We brought over a plate of
asparagus with prosciutto


204
0:7:23,35 --> 0:7:25,86
gelee and this fried
egg on top.


205
0:7:25,86 --> 0:7:29,43
And when I hit that egg, it shot
all over Michael's nice


206
0:7:29,43 --> 0:7:30,58
velvet jacket.


207
0:7:30,58 --> 0:7:31,64
Ready?


208
0:7:31,64 --> 0:7:33,0
JOHNNY MAC: Yeah, get the
money shot on that.


209
0:7:33,0 --> 0:7:33,968
EVERYONE: Oh!


210
0:7:33,968 --> 0:7:38,324
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Oh my God,
how did you do that, dude?


211
0:7:38,324 --> 0:7:39,91
That was perfect.


212
0:7:39,91 --> 0:7:41,89
It's on the bandage, too.


213
0:7:41,89 --> 0:7:44,162
That's fucking so pornographic,
bro.


214
0:7:44,162 --> 0:7:46,54
JEFF MICHAUD: We were getting
ready to leave and then


215
0:7:46,54 --> 0:7:48,33
everybody was asking
where's Steve?


216
0:7:48,33 --> 0:7:48,665
Where's Steve?


217
0:7:48,665 --> 0:7:50,19
And they said he's
in the bathroom.


218
0:7:50,19 --> 0:7:54,8
And so we grabbed the camera
and went downstairs and


219
0:7:54,8 --> 0:7:56,106
basically I kicked the bathroom
door in on him.


220
0:7:56,106 --> 0:7:57,594
Open all ready!


221
0:7:57,594 --> 0:8:0,74
Yeah!


222
0:8:0,74 --> 0:8:2,36
JOHNNY MAC: You're
on munchies, man!


223
0:8:2,36 --> 0:8:4,97
STEVE WILDY: You're going to
need a body bag, Johnny!


224
0:8:4,97 --> 0:8:8,648
JOHNNY MAC: Well, locker room
humor, it never gets old.


225
0:8:8,648 --> 0:8:9,78
JEFF MICHAUD: You ready?


226
0:8:9,78 --> 0:8:13,69
When we left Pub & Kitchen, we
added Johnny Mac with us and


227
0:8:13,69 --> 0:8:15,73
we all headed back
to Alla Spina for


228
0:8:15,73 --> 0:8:16,66
some late-night munchies.


229
0:8:16,66 --> 0:8:20,99
STEVE WILDY: Is anybody else
freaked out by the ease with


230
0:8:20,99 --> 0:8:24,279
which Johnny flipped open the
men's room stall door?


231
0:8:24,279 --> 0:8:26,5
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: He
was like, it's just


232
0:8:26,5 --> 0:8:26,79
like the rest stop.


233
0:8:26,79 --> 0:8:29,55
JEFF MICHAUD: We planned to cook
some of the food at Alla


234
0:8:29,55 --> 0:8:31,83
Spina that really makes
us who we are.


235
0:8:31,83 --> 0:8:34,72
JOHNNY MAC: I'll pull an
espresso in a minute, dude.


236
0:8:34,72 --> 0:8:38,3
JEFF MICHAUD: It's something I
like to eat late at night.


237
0:8:38,3 --> 0:8:40,65
After a couple of beers, you
always want some fried stuff.


238
0:8:40,65 --> 0:8:45,9
So we did some fried pig tails
with a fennel agrodolce which


239
0:8:45,9 --> 0:8:46,56
is a sweet and sour sauce.


240
0:8:46,56 --> 0:8:48,26
It's almost like a version of
a chicken wing, except it's


241
0:8:48,26 --> 0:8:50,81
done with pig tails.


242
0:8:50,81 --> 0:8:54,3
We did some awesome fried snails
in a beer batter with a


243
0:8:54,3 --> 0:8:55,93
garlic and parsley
tartar sauce.


244
0:8:55,93 --> 0:8:58,92
These are extra large
burgundy snails.


245
0:8:58,92 --> 0:9:3,2
And the show stopper's always
that big pig's head.


246
0:9:3,2 --> 0:9:4,82
We brine for about four
days, it comes off


247
0:9:4,82 --> 0:9:6,12
about a 30 pound pig.


248
0:9:6,12 --> 0:9:8,595
After it comes out of the brine,
we score the face, we


249
0:9:8,595 --> 0:9:11,71
pour the agrodulce over it, we
roast it in the oven for 20


250
0:9:11,71 --> 0:9:12,79
minutes, 30 minutes.


251
0:9:12,79 --> 0:9:15,73
It's gets all nice and charred
and caramelized.


252
0:9:15,73 --> 0:9:17,47
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: You can
make this one squeal.


253
0:9:17,47 --> 0:9:19,82
[SQUEALS]


254
0:9:19,82 --> 0:9:21,23
JEFF MICHAUD: All right, guys.


255
0:9:21,23 --> 0:9:22,17
ERIN O'SHEA: What are
you looking at?


256
0:9:22,17 --> 0:9:23,95
Oh, shit.


257
0:9:23,95 --> 0:9:25,88
JEFF MICHAUD: The cheeks are
falling off, the neck's


258
0:9:25,88 --> 0:9:26,66
falling off.


259
0:9:26,66 --> 0:9:28,79
There's people that eat the
eyes, that crack the skull


260
0:9:28,79 --> 0:9:30,7
open and they go
for the brains.


261
0:9:30,7 --> 0:9:31,194
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV:
Thanks, Jeff.


262
0:9:31,194 --> 0:9:31,998
It looks fucking awesome.


263
0:9:31,998 --> 0:9:32,4
ERIN O'SHEA: Here's to that.


264
0:9:32,4 --> 0:9:33,65
Thank you.


265
0:9:33,65 --> 0:9:36,38



266
0:9:36,38 --> 0:9:37,499
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: It's normal
for you to stick


267
0:9:37,499 --> 0:9:38,96
your dick in my mouth.


268
0:9:38,96 --> 0:9:39,934
Totally.


269
0:9:39,934 --> 0:9:41,29
JEFF MICHAUD: Did you get
some snails, Johnny?


270
0:9:41,29 --> 0:9:42,906
JOHNNY MAC: Yeah, but I
would like some more.


271
0:9:42,906 --> 0:9:47,866



272
0:9:47,866 --> 0:9:48,858
JEFF MICHAUD: Cheers, guys.


273
0:9:48,858 --> 0:9:51,834
Thanks for coming out tonight.


274
0:9:51,834 --> 0:9:53,322
MICHAEL SOLOMONOV: Cheers!


275
0:9:53,322 --> 0:9:55,802
Woo!


276
0:9:55,802 --> 0:9:58,93
JEFF MICHAUD: When you get to
that point, it's like you're


277
0:9:58,93 --> 0:10:0,18
just eating because it's there.


278
0:10:0,18 --> 0:12:0,18
