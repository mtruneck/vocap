2
0:0:21,53 --> 0:0:26,33
We're at Healesville Sanctuary
and up in the hospital,


3
0:0:26,33 --> 0:0:28,98
specifically.


4
0:0:28,98 --> 0:0:32,409
Healesville Sanctuary has what
is called the Australian


5
0:0:32,409 --> 0:0:34,83
Wildlife Health Center.


6
0:0:34,83 --> 0:0:39,68
And it's designed not only to
service our collection of


7
0:0:39,68 --> 0:0:42,59
animals, but also wildlife.


8
0:0:42,59 --> 0:0:49,24
So people bring in these orphans
or an injured animal.


9
0:0:49,24 --> 0:0:52,89



10
0:0:52,89 --> 0:0:54,932
Now, that's perfectly
normal [CHUCKLES]


11
0:0:54,932 --> 0:0:56,92
behavior.


12
0:0:56,92 --> 0:0:58,53
So people will bring
in their sick,


13
0:0:58,53 --> 0:1:0,96
injured, or orphaned wildlife.


14
0:1:0,96 --> 0:1:6,99
And the vets and other hospital
staff will look after


15
0:1:6,99 --> 0:1:7,98
their medical needs.


16
0:1:7,98 --> 0:1:10,78
At which point, they would
either go into one of the


17
0:1:10,78 --> 0:1:12,95
wards behind you.


18
0:1:12,95 --> 0:1:17,1
Or they would go
off to a carer.


19
0:1:17,1 --> 0:1:18,82
This is Belle.


20
0:1:18,82 --> 0:1:22,84
And she is around
10 months old--


21
0:1:22,84 --> 0:1:24,42
it can be hard to judge.


22
0:1:24,42 --> 0:1:26,36
She's over 6 kilograms.


23
0:1:26,36 --> 0:1:29,96
Belle's mother was
hit by a car.


24
0:1:29,96 --> 0:1:33,975
And the people who saw her on
the side of the road went over


25
0:1:33,975 --> 0:1:37,58
and checked to see if the
wombat had a pouch.


26
0:1:37,58 --> 0:1:42,72
And Belle here was inside.


27
0:1:42,72 --> 0:1:43,43
She likes to be rocked.


28
0:1:43,43 --> 0:1:49,15



29
0:1:49,15 --> 0:1:52,55
And I don't know if it makes any
difference, but I like to


30
0:1:52,55 --> 0:1:54,927
sing to her sometimes.


31
0:1:54,927 --> 0:2:9,837
[HUMMING]


32
0:2:9,837 --> 0:2:10,831
Come on.


33
0:2:10,831 --> 0:2:12,819
Come on.


34
0:2:12,819 --> 0:2:14,59
This is my little
wombat shuffle.


35
0:2:14,59 --> 0:2:17,98
It gets their attention
usually.


36
0:2:17,98 --> 0:2:21,3



37
0:2:21,3 --> 0:2:23,49
Good girl.


38
0:2:23,49 --> 0:2:26,17
Nice work, Belle.


39
0:2:26,17 --> 0:2:29,4
At this stage, she usually likes
to have a little cuddle


40
0:2:29,4 --> 0:2:31,75
and a bit of a snooze.


41
0:2:31,75 --> 0:2:36,1
But because Phoenix is here,
she'll probably want to get


42
0:2:36,1 --> 0:2:37,35
down and play.


43
0:2:37,35 --> 0:2:39,8



44
0:2:39,8 --> 0:2:41,256
Yes, you like that, don't you?


45
0:2:41,256 --> 0:2:41,632
Yeah.


46
0:2:41,632 --> 0:2:43,99
You too, Phoenix.


47
0:2:43,99 --> 0:2:50,25
What I love about wombats is
they've got good, funny


48
0:2:50,25 --> 0:2:51,81
characters--


49
0:2:51,81 --> 0:2:53,35
extremely cheeky.


50
0:2:53,35 --> 0:2:55,15
Phoenix is very confident.


51
0:2:55,15 --> 0:2:57,35
I think of her as a
bit of a tomboy.


52
0:2:57,35 --> 0:3:1,1
She often acts inappropriately,
biting things


53
0:3:1,1 --> 0:3:3,5
she's not meant to do.


54
0:3:3,5 --> 0:3:7,17
And Belle is a real lady.


55
0:3:7,17 --> 0:3:12,18
So she's quite shy as well--


56
0:3:12,18 --> 0:3:14,41
of people, generally.


57
0:3:14,41 --> 0:3:17,92
Phoenix doesn't only like
people, she seems positively


58
0:3:17,92 --> 0:3:19,35
fascinated by people.


59
0:3:19,35 --> 0:3:23,43
So I'm often chasing
her around,


60
0:3:23,43 --> 0:3:25,28
trying to get her back.


61
0:3:25,28 --> 0:3:30,14
And Belle's much happier
to stick close to me.


62
0:3:30,14 --> 0:3:31,39
Aren't you, darling?


63
0:3:31,39 --> 0:3:33,66



64
0:3:33,66 --> 0:3:35,93
And then again, they've got
a lot of similarities.


65
0:3:35,93 --> 0:3:41,68
They like to dig and nip
and headbutt me.


66
0:3:41,68 --> 0:3:44,5
They're my beautiful monsters,
aren't you?


67
0:3:44,5 --> 0:3:47,32
Oh, not at the same
time, girls.


68
0:3:47,32 --> 0:3:49,72
Goodness, you're
hurrying today.


69
0:3:49,72 --> 0:3:52,42
