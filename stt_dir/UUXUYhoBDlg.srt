0:0:4,192 --> 0:0:5,914
Are you still made your homework?


2
0:0:5,914 --> 0:0:7,82
- I'm almost done.


3
0:0:7,82 --> 0:0:8,617
- You wouldn't have
to be almost done


4
0:0:8,617 --> 0:0:10,118
if you came home
and did your homework


5
0:0:10,118 --> 0:0:12,87
instead of playing
video games first.


6
0:0:12,87 --> 0:0:14,22
- Morning.
- Hey, good morning.


7
0:0:14,22 --> 0:0:15,591
- Oh, nice outfit.


8
0:0:15,591 --> 0:0:16,992
You going to court?


9
0:0:16,992 --> 0:0:18,227
- Shut up.


10
0:0:18,227 --> 0:0:20,796
- Don't my two girls look nice
this morning.


11
0:0:20,796 --> 0:0:22,731
- Oh, thank you.


12
0:0:22,731 --> 0:0:24,8
It's "take your child
to work day."


13
0:0:24,8 --> 0:0:27,2
Please tell me
you didn't forget.


14
0:0:27,2 --> 0:0:28,7
- I want to go to work.


15
0:0:28,7 --> 0:0:29,471
- Go to homework.


16
0:0:29,471 --> 0:0:30,706
- You will, sweetheart.


17
0:0:30,706 --> 0:0:32,107
You can go to work
with your father


18
0:0:32,107 --> 0:0:33,742
as soon as he contacts
the school


19
0:0:33,742 --> 0:0:36,345
and tells them he forgot
to call them a month ago.


20
0:0:36,345 --> 0:0:37,846
- Oh, can try come?


21
0:0:37,846 --> 0:0:39,81
- If it's okay with his mother.


22
0:0:39,81 --> 0:0:43,318
And since Kevin
is gonna be with you,


23
0:0:43,318 --> 0:0:45,354
can you pick up
his dress shoes and socks


24
0:0:45,354 --> 0:0:46,688
for the school dance?


25
0:0:46,688 --> 0:0:47,99
- Okay.
- Lindsay, you ready?


26
0:0:47,99 --> 0:0:49,291
Let's go.


27
0:0:49,291 --> 0:0:50,792
- All right, bye, babe.
- Bye.


28
0:0:50,792 --> 0:0:52,961
- Bye, mom.
- Love you guys.


29
0:0:52,961 --> 0:0:55,3
- Here you go.
- What's this for?


30
0:0:55,3 --> 0:0:56,732
- You're going
to be the janitor, right?


31
0:0:56,732 --> 0:0:57,966

37
0:1:10,546 --> 0:1:12,47
- Well, you came on a good day.


38
0:1:12,47 --> 0:1:14,316
Today we are making
a presentation


39
0:1:14,316 --> 0:1:16,18
for an engagement party.


40
0:1:16,18 --> 0:1:17,519
- You know, one of these days,


41
0:1:17,519 --> 0:1:18,954
you're going
to be doing this for me.


42
0:1:18,954 --> 0:1:20,489
- How come you're
not married, Gigi?


43
0:1:20,489 --> 0:1:22,9
- Because I'm particular, baby.


44
0:1:22,9 --> 0:1:23,792
I'm like good credit.


45
0:1:23,792 --> 0:1:26,762
Just because you want
me doesn't mean you can have me.


46
0:1:26,762 --> 0:1:29,765
I mean, you got to...
You got to work for me.


47
0:1:29,765 --> 0:1:30,899
[Chuckles]


48
0:1:30,899 --> 0:1:32,568
You got to qualify for me.


49
0:1:32,568 --> 0:1:34,503
You got to maintain me.


50
0:1:34,503 --> 0:1:37,573
Whoo!
[Laughs]


51
0:1:37,573 --> 0:1:38,74
Oh.


52
0:1:38,74 --> 0:1:41,51
- All right, well,
speaking of a credit line,


53
0:1:41,51 --> 0:1:43,712
I thought you were going
on a date last night?


54
0:1:43,712 --> 0:1:44,78
- I thought I was too.


55
0:1:44,78 --> 0:1:46,14
I got all dressed up,


56
0:1:46,14 --> 0:1:48,183
even took my Gucci shoes
out of their box,


57
0:1:48,183 --> 0:1:49,751
and you know where
this man took me to?


58
0:1:49,751 --> 0:1:50,819
Coffee.


59
0:1:50,819 --> 0:1:52,54
- What's wrong with coffee?


60
0:1:52,54 --> 0:1:53,355
- Coffee sucks.


61
0:1:53,355 --> 0:1:54,89
Because at coffee, you talk,


62
0:1:54,89 --> 0:1:55,958
and that's boring.


63
0:1:55,958 --> 0:1:56,959
"What are your likes?


64
0:1:56,959 --> 0:1:57,96
What are your dislikes?"


65
0:1:57,96 --> 0:1:59,227
It's like an interrogation.


66
0:1:59,227 --> 0:2:0,696
You know, if I wanted to talk,


67
0:2:0,696 --> 0:2:2,497
I'll get on the Internet
in a chat room


68
0:2:2,497 --> 0:2:3,932
like everyone else.


69
0:2:3,932 --> 0:2:5,467
- The nerve of some people,


70
0:2:5,467 --> 0:2:8,503
trying to sit down
and get to know you.


71
0:2:8,503 --> 0:2:10,72
What is wrong with these men?


72
0:2:10,72 --> 0:2:11,84
- Right?


73
0:2:11,84 --> 0:2:14,943
- You want... you want
an exciting man.


74
0:2:14,943 --> 0:2:17,112
- Mm.
- Somebody mysterious.


75
0:2:17,112 --> 0:2:18,13
- That's right.


76
0:2:18,13 --> 0:2:19,881
- And sexy.
- Work it.


77
0:2:19,881 --> 0:2:21,316
- With a Bentley.


78
0:2:21,316 --> 0:2:22,718
- Hello.


79
0:2:22,718 --> 0:2:24,519
- And a wife and some kids...
- No, come on.


80
0:2:24,519 --> 0:2:26,588
- And 15 other mistresses
and another identity.


81
0:2:26,588 --> 0:2:27,923
- All right, no.


82
0:2:27,923 --> 0:2:29,91
The point is,


83
0:2:29,91 --> 0:2:31,426
he could at least taken me
to happy hour.


84
0:2:31,426 --> 0:2:33,562
I want to be able
to get dressed up,


85
0:2:33,562 --> 0:2:35,797
have a cocktail,
have and some hors d'oeurves,


86
0:2:35,797 --> 0:2:37,466

by a whole bunch people


87
0:2:37,466 --> 0:2:40,302
looking for free wi-fi.


88
0:2:40,302 --> 0:2:41,703
- Suzanne?


89
0:2:41,703 --> 0:2:42,704
- [Gasps]


90
0:2:42,704 --> 0:2:44,506
Tam? Oh!


91
0:2:44,506 --> 0:2:46,775
Oh, my gosh, you look amazing.


92
0:2:46,775 --> 0:2:49,311
This is Tamara hensley.


93
0:2:49,311 --> 0:2:51,13
We went to High School together.


94
0:2:51,13 --> 0:2:52,247
- We were best friends.


95
0:2:52,247 --> 0:2:54,416
- Cool.
- And who is this?


96
0:2:54,416 --> 0:2:55,55
- Yes.


97
0:2:55,55 --> 0:2:58,253
This is my daughter,
this is Lindsay.


98
0:2:58,253 --> 0:2:59,855
- It's so nice to meet you.


99
0:2:59,855 --> 0:3:2,224
- You are so beautiful.
- Thank you.


100
0:3:2,224 --> 0:3:3,725
- Is this the only one?


101
0:3:3,725 --> 0:3:5,927
- No, she has a brother, Kevin.


102
0:3:5,927 --> 0:3:7,963
Oh, but have a seat.


103
0:3:7,963 --> 0:3:11,233
Tam, this is so exciting.


104
0:3:11,233 --> 0:3:13,902
You're getting engaged and we
get to help plan the party.


105
0:3:13,902 --> 0:3:14,97
- Yay.
- [Chuckling]


106
0:3:14,97 --> 0:3:17,572
- Okay, so are we wearing white?


107
0:3:17,572 --> 0:3:19,474
- Yes, we are.
- All right.


108
0:3:19,474 --> 0:3:20,942
- Well, tell us about him.


109
0:3:20,942 --> 0:3:22,444
- Oh, girl,
I don't where to start.


110
0:3:22,444 --> 0:3:24,88
I have waited so patiently
for my prince.


111
0:3:24,88 --> 0:3:27,649
But it was worth it.


112
0:3:27,649 --> 0:3:28,717
[Chuckles]


113
0:3:28,717 --> 0:3:29,818
He's awesome.


114
0:3:29,818 --> 0:3:31,153
- Oh, and I bet
he didn't take you


115
0:3:31,153 --> 0:3:32,988
to coffee
on your first date either.


116
0:3:32,988 --> 0:3:34,523
- Uh, we met at happy hour.


117
0:3:34,523 --> 0:3:36,658
- See? I'm not crazy.


118
0:3:36,658 --> 0:3:38,427
- All right, well, tam,
why don't you look


119
0:3:38,427 --> 0:3:40,529
through these dessert ideas.


120
0:3:40,529 --> 0:3:42,33
And Lindsay, you take notes.


121
0:3:42,33 --> 0:3:45,0
- Okay.


122
0:3:45,0 --> 0:3:48,103
So what was my mom like when she
was a teenager?


123
0:3:48,103 --> 0:3:49,271
- I was an angel.


124
0:3:49,271 --> 0:3:50,305
[Laughter]


125
0:3:50,305 --> 0:3:51,573
- We had a lot of fun together.


126
0:3:51,573 --> 0:3:53,141
- What kind of fun?


127
0:3:53,141 --> 0:3:56,344
- The same kind you're going
to deny having when you grow up.


128
0:3:56,344 --> 0:3:57,913
- I don't know what you mean.


129
0:3:57,913 --> 0:3:59,514
- Well, compared to now,


130
0:3:59,514 --> 0:4:1,783
we were probably
a lot more tame than we think.


131
0:4:1,783 --> 0:4:3,118
- That's so weird.


132
0:4:3,118 --> 0:4:5,52
'Cause she's kind of strict now.


133
0:4:5,52 --> 0:4:7,255
- Uh, I am not strict.


134
0:4:7,255 --> 0:4:8,724
I'm cautious.


135
0:4:8,724 --> 0:4:10,292
It's a different world
out there.


136
0:4:10,292 --> 0:4:12,394
- Amen to that.
[Chuckles]


137
0:4:12,394 --> 0:4:14,362
But we did our thing,
didn't we, Suzanne?


138
0:4:14,362 --> 0:4:17,933
- Whoo, girl, if those
school walls could talk.


139
0:4:17,933 --> 0:4:21,203
- Talk? Please talk.


140
0:4:21,203 --> 0:4:25,974
- Take some notes.


141
0:4:25,974 --> 0:4:28,61
- When actors, tennis players
and models turn pro,


142
0:4:28,61 --> 0:4:29,811
they're just kids.


143
0:4:29,811 --> 0:4:32,214
So why should basketball
be any different?


144
0:4:32,214 --> 0:4:34,282
I'm Nick Kingston-persons.


145
0:4:34,282 --> 0:4:36,451
Peace out.


146
0:4:36,451 --> 0:4:37,486
How was that?


147
0:4:37,486 --> 0:4:38,787
- 2:30.


148
0:4:38,787 --> 0:4:39,888
Perfect.


149
0:4:39,888 --> 0:4:41,56
- It was good.


150
0:4:41,56 --> 0:4:42,858
- Yeah, Stuart Scott
better start looking


151
0:4:42,858 --> 0:4:44,25
at retirement homes.


152
0:4:44,25 --> 0:4:45,93
- Thanks.


153
0:4:45,93 --> 0:4:46,561
- Kevin, can tell me


154
0:4:46,561 --> 0:4:48,23
about this school dance
you're going to?


155
0:4:48,23 --> 0:4:49,631
- Uh, it's on Saturday.


156
0:4:49,631 --> 0:4:50,766
It's at school.


157
0:4:50,766 --> 0:4:52,367
And it's a dance.


158
0:4:52,367 --> 0:4:54,136
- He's crushing on Melanie.


159
0:4:54,136 --> 0:4:55,17
I think it's a mistake.


160
0:4:55,17 --> 0:4:57,239
Everyone goes
for the pretty girl.


161
0:4:57,239 --> 0:4:59,141
It cuts down your chances.


162
0:4:59,141 --> 0:5:1,109
- Sometimes you get
the pretty girl.


163
0:5:1,109 --> 0:5:2,744
I did it with Kevin's mom.


164
0:5:2,744 --> 0:5:4,546
- You did it with Kevin's mom?


165
0:5:4,546 --> 0:5:6,481
- Hey, dude,
don't talk about my mom.


166
0:5:6,481 --> 0:5:8,183
- It's a shot, okay?


167
0:5:8,183 --> 0:5:9,451
- I want to, but I got no game.


168
0:5:9,451 --> 0:5:11,419
- Seriously, like, zero.


169
0:5:11,419 --> 0:5:12,687
- None.
- Nada.


170
0:5:12,687 --> 0:5:13,722
- My game is so bad,


171
0:5:13,722 --> 0:5:15,29
I could play for the clippers.


172
0:5:15,29 --> 0:5:16,758
- How could you have game?


173
0:5:16,758 --> 0:5:18,26
You're just starting out.


174
0:5:18,26 --> 0:5:20,695
Game is learned
through trial and error.


175
0:5:20,695 --> 0:5:22,931
- True, last week,
I learned that a girl


176
0:5:22,931 --> 0:5:25,1
won't talk to you if you have
a booger in your nose.


177
0:5:25,1 --> 0:5:27,969
- Yeah.
- It's distracting.


178
0:5:27,969 --> 0:5:29,538
- Important lesson:


179
0:5:29,538 --> 0:5:32,541
Men with game always dress
the part.


180
0:5:32,541 --> 0:5:33,975
What are you wearing
to the dance?


181
0:5:33,975 --> 0:5:34,943
- This.


182
0:5:34,943 --> 0:5:36,578
- You slept in that.


183
0:5:36,578 --> 0:5:38,446
Plus, I can see
what you ate last night.


184
0:5:38,446 --> 0:5:40,415
- You mean last week.


185
0:5:40,415 --> 0:5:44,452
- Oh, right.


186
0:5:44,452 --> 0:5:47,122
- [Chuckles] So just
after six months,


187
0:5:47,122 --> 0:5:48,757
Robbie shows up to my school


188
0:5:48,757 --> 0:5:52,594
with these balloons and proposes
in front of my class.


189
0:5:52,594 --> 0:5:55,997
- Oh, my God,
that is so romantic.


190
0:5:55,997 --> 0:5:58,233
Inexpensive, but romantic.


191
0:5:58,233 --> 0:6:1,2
- Tam, what is your married name
going to be?


192
0:6:1,2 --> 0:6:3,138
- Mrs. Robert Purcell.


193
0:6:3,138 --> 0:6:4,105
[Pencil tip cracks]


194
0:6:4,105 --> 0:6:5,64
- Ooh.
[Chortles]


195
0:6:5,64 --> 0:6:6,842
Wow.


196
0:6:6,842 --> 0:6:7,943
Did you see that?


197
0:6:7,943 --> 0:6:9,678
This pencil just kind of...


198
0:6:9,678 --> 0:6:11,479
It snapped, so...


199
0:6:11,479 --> 0:6:12,48
What's the number?


200
0:6:12,48 --> 0:6:13,648
It's number one.


201
0:6:13,648 --> 0:6:15,65
You know what,
we need some number two pencils.


202
0:6:15,65 --> 0:6:18,987
So Suzanne, can you help me find
some number two pencils?


203
0:6:18,987 --> 0:6:20,522
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.


204
0:6:20,522 --> 0:6:23,491
[Chuckles]


205
0:6:23,491 --> 0:6:27,62
- So Lindsay, Lindsay, Lindsay.


206
0:6:27,62 --> 0:6:28,23
You're so big.


207
0:6:28,23 --> 0:6:31,833
And your brother,
he must be, what, 18, 19 by now?


208
0:6:31,833 --> 0:6:34,469
- What? No, he's 12.


209
0:6:34,469 --> 0:6:38,874
- 12.


210
0:6:38,874 --> 0:6:40,375
- What is wrong with you, man?


211
0:6:40,375 --> 0:6:42,777
- Would you really want me
to create an engagement party


212
0:6:42,777 --> 0:6:44,412
for the man
I should have married?


213
0:6:44,412 --> 0:6:45,58
- No, I wouldn't.


214
0:6:45,58 --> 0:6:47,616
- Then replace me on this job,
Suzanne.


215
0:6:47,616 --> 0:6:49,15
- What? Why?


216
0:6:49,15 --> 0:6:51,987
- You don't remember
Robert Purcell?


217
0:6:51,987 --> 0:6:53,21
- No.


218
0:6:53,21 --> 0:6:56,992
- I dated him for
almost 31/2 weeks.


219
0:6:56,992 --> 0:6:59,594
- Okay, but you broke up
with him.


220
0:6:59,594 --> 0:7:1,62
- Only six months ago.


221
0:7:1,62 --> 0:7:3,999
And now he's marrying...


222
0:7:3,999 --> 0:7:5,7
Her.


223
0:7:5,7 --> 0:7:7,435
Uh...


224
0:7:7,435 --> 0:7:12,507
Excuse me, got to go.


225
0:7:12,507 --> 0:7:15,628
- [Sighs]


226
0:7:15,628 --> 0:7:17,3
[Both groan]


227
0:7:17,3 --> 0:7:20,3
- Whoo.


228
0:7:20,3 --> 0:7:22,902
- Man, shopping...


229
0:7:22,902 --> 0:7:24,37
- Uh-uh-uh.


230
0:7:24,37 --> 0:7:25,305
Going to the mall.


231
0:7:25,305 --> 0:7:28,341
- Right, going to
the mall is exhausting.


232
0:7:28,341 --> 0:7:30,843
- That's why black women
are so strong.


233
0:7:30,843 --> 0:7:32,211
They can stay
at the mall all day,


234
0:7:32,211 --> 0:7:35,114
just walking
around buying stuff.


235
0:7:35,114 --> 0:7:37,183
- How long did it take you
to understand women?


236
0:7:37,183 --> 0:7:38,451
- I still don't.


237
0:7:38,451 --> 0:7:40,253
But I know I don't.


238
0:7:40,253 --> 0:7:42,889
And that, my son,
is the secret.


239
0:7:42,889 --> 0:7:44,857
- Well, if it's a secret,
how did you find out?


240
0:7:44,857 --> 0:7:46,626
- Listen, the point is,


241
0:7:46,626 --> 0:7:48,995
you need
to embrace your ignorance


242
0:7:48,995 --> 0:7:50,563
and just do what they say.


243
0:7:50,563 --> 0:7:51,698
'Cause a woman is like one


244
0:7:51,698 --> 0:7:53,866
of those thousand-piece
Jigsaw puzzles,


245
0:7:53,866 --> 0:7:55,635
and the top half is all sky.


246
0:7:55,635 --> 0:7:57,937
And every time you find a piece
that fits,


247
0:7:57,937 --> 0:8:1,374
the woman will take a pair of
scissors and cut the tip off.


248
0:8:1,374 --> 0:8:3,42
- Because women are crazy?


249
0:8:3,42 --> 0:8:4,677
- Exactly.


250
0:8:4,677 --> 0:8:5,945
- So what do you do?


251
0:8:5,945 --> 0:8:7,88
- Just be the best you
you can be.


252
0:8:7,88 --> 0:8:9,682
It's like my video blog.


253
0:8:9,682 --> 0:8:10,783
I look my best.


254
0:8:10,783 --> 0:8:13,219
I find a great topic
to talk about.


255
0:8:13,219 --> 0:8:14,354
I got a great sign-off...


256
0:8:14,354 --> 0:8:16,389
- Hey, let's look
at the stuff we bought?


257
0:8:16,389 --> 0:8:17,657
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


258
0:8:17,657 --> 0:8:18,691
What was that?


259
0:8:18,691 --> 0:8:20,226
- What? I just wan
to look at the stuff.


260
0:8:20,226 --> 0:8:22,161
You know, those pants
were really interesting.


261
0:8:22,161 --> 0:8:24,297
- So you just gonna leave
out there like that, huh?


262
0:8:24,297 --> 0:8:26,65
I mean, if I had something
on my face,


263
0:8:26,65 --> 0:8:27,4
you wouldn't say nothing?


264
0:8:27,4 --> 0:8:29,636
You'd just let me stand there
and be embarrassed?


265
0:8:29,636 --> 0:8:31,371
Come on, man,
you know something's wrong.


266
0:8:31,371 --> 0:8:32,372
You feel something.


267
0:8:32,372 --> 0:8:33,706
Tell... what is it?


268
0:8:33,706 --> 0:8:35,408
- Okay, did you already post it?


269
0:8:35,408 --> 0:8:36,643
- No, not yet.


270
0:8:36,643 --> 0:8:39,612
- Okay, it was just
the big "peace out."


271
0:8:39,612 --> 0:8:41,114
- What's wrong with that?


272
0:8:41,114 --> 0:8:42,582
- It's old.


273
0:8:42,582 --> 0:8:43,65
- I thought it was good.


274
0:8:43,65 --> 0:8:45,485
- That's because you're old.


275
0:8:45,485 --> 0:8:48,988
- Go try your clothes on.


276
0:8:48,988 --> 0:8:50,189
- Oh, yeah, I forgot.


277
0:8:50,189 --> 0:8:51,157
- What?


278
0:8:51,157 --> 0:8:56,596
- Peace out.


279
0:8:56,596 --> 0:8:59,332
- I don't understand
why you're so upset.


280
0:8:59,332 --> 0:9:2,35
You had that man,
and you broke up with him.


281
0:9:2,35 --> 0:9:3,436
- I know. Exactly.


282
0:9:3,436 --> 0:9:4,737
What's wrong with me?


283
0:9:4,737 --> 0:9:7,373
- Nothing.
He wasn't the man for you.


284
0:9:7,373 --> 0:9:8,941
- Well, he's marrying her.


285
0:9:8,941 --> 0:9:10,91
What does she have that I don't?


286
0:9:10,91 --> 0:9:12,445
- Waterproof mascara?


287
0:9:12,445 --> 0:9:13,546
- Not funny.


288
0:9:13,546 --> 0:9:14,981
- A little funny.


289
0:9:14,981 --> 0:9:18,17
Gigi, you did not want him.


290
0:9:18,17 --> 0:9:20,753
- Yeah, but I don't want her
to have him either.


291
0:9:20,753 --> 0:9:23,89
I mean, I'm a very petty woman.


292
0:9:23,89 --> 0:9:25,425
I want every man I've ever
broken up with


293
0:9:25,425 --> 0:9:27,727
to be destroyed
and never recover.


294
0:9:27,727 --> 0:9:30,563
But if he must recover,
it should take years.


295
0:9:30,563 --> 0:9:32,799
Like Mike Tyson.


296
0:9:32,799 --> 0:9:34,133
- Okay.


297
0:9:34,133 --> 0:9:35,501
Go home.


298
0:9:35,501 --> 0:9:37,67
And if you can't bear to come
in tomorrow,


299
0:9:37,67 --> 0:9:38,905
I will understand.


300
0:9:38,905 --> 0:9:40,239
I'll get someone to sit in.


301
0:9:40,239 --> 0:9:43,209
- Great, now you're
replacing me too.


302
0:9:43,209 --> 0:9:45,44
- That is not what I meant.


303
0:9:45,44 --> 0:9:45,978
- Yeah.


304
0:9:45,978 --> 0:9:47,113
- Hey, Gigi.
- Yeah.


305
0:9:47,113 --> 0:9:52,85
- Bye, Gigi.
- Yeah.


306
0:9:52,85 --> 0:9:53,86
- Should I ask?


307
0:9:53,86 --> 0:9:54,187
- No.


308
0:9:54,187 --> 0:9:55,154
- Cool.


309
0:9:55,154 --> 0:9:56,255
- Just like that?


310
0:9:56,255 --> 0:9:57,423
- Just like that.


311
0:9:57,423 --> 0:9:58,524
- Should I ask?


312
0:9:58,524 --> 0:10:0,46
- No.
- Cool.


313
0:10:0,46 --> 0:10:3,863
Oh, it looks like somebody went
to the barbershop.


314
0:10:3,863 --> 0:10:5,398
- And the mall.
- All right.


315
0:10:5,398 --> 0:10:6,833
Are you ready for the dance?


316
0:10:6,833 --> 0:10:9,1
- Well, are you still gonna
teach me some dance moves?


317
0:10:9,1 --> 0:10:10,103
- Yeah.


318
0:10:10,103 --> 0:10:11,838
- If he tries to teach you
the Harlem shake,


319
0:10:11,838 --> 0:10:12,839
let me know.


320
0:10:12,839 --> 0:10:14,107
- What's the Harlem shake?


321
0:10:14,107 --> 0:10:15,942
- It's your mother's
favorite dance.


322
0:10:15,942 --> 0:10:17,76
Aw, you like that.


323
0:10:17,76 --> 0:10:18,745
I know do.
[Laughs]


324
0:10:18,745 --> 0:10:20,213
We gonna start
with something simple,


325
0:10:20,213 --> 0:10:21,581
and then we'll see how it goes.


326
0:10:21,581 --> 0:10:23,149
- What about slow dancing?


327
0:10:23,149 --> 0:10:24,817
- Well, here
is your first pointer:


328
0:10:24,817 --> 0:10:26,552
When slow dancing with a lady,


329
0:10:26,552 --> 0:10:29,555
there should be at least a phone
book's distance between you.


330
0:10:29,555 --> 0:10:30,757
- Okay.


331
0:10:30,757 --> 0:10:33,726
What's a phone book?


332
0:10:33,726 --> 0:10:34,794
No, I'm serious.


333
0:10:34,794 --> 0:10:36,629
Is it, like, a book
with pictures of phones.


334
0:10:36,629 --> 0:10:38,765
- Come on, little man.
We got work to do.


335
0:10:38,765 --> 0:10:40,466
Get the rhythm
in your walk, man.


336
0:10:40,466 --> 0:10:41,868
Get the rhythm in your walk.


337
0:10:41,868 --> 0:10:43,669
- That's right, smooth.
- Like Obama.


338
0:10:43,669 --> 0:10:46,139
- [Chuckles]


339
0:10:46,139 --> 0:10:48,4
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hi.


340
0:10:48,4 --> 0:10:49,809
- So did you have
a good time today?


341
0:10:49,809 --> 0:10:51,377
- Yeah, it was fun.


342
0:10:51,377 --> 0:10:53,246
Can I ask you a question?


343
0:10:53,246 --> 0:10:54,247
- Yeah, sure, what is it?


344
0:10:54,247 --> 0:11:1,752
- Do I have an older brother?


345
0:11:1,752 --> 0:11:3,488
- Do you wha... wha...


346
0:11:3,488 --> 0:11:4,856
What kind of question is that?


347
0:11:4,856 --> 0:11:6,757
No. Of course not.


348
0:11:6,757 --> 0:11:8,92
And who said that?


349
0:11:8,92 --> 0:11:9,527
- Tam sort of...


350
0:11:9,527 --> 0:11:10,695
- Sort of?


351
0:11:10,695 --> 0:11:12,73
How do you sort of say
I have another child?


352
0:11:12,73 --> 0:11:14,699
- Well, she didn't say you did.


353
0:11:14,699 --> 0:11:16,901
She just asked me
if I had an older brother.


354
0:11:16,901 --> 0:11:19,203
And she's known you
for a long time,


355
0:11:19,203 --> 0:11:21,672
so I was just wondering
why she would think that.


356
0:11:21,672 --> 0:11:23,341
- How should I know
why tam thinks


357
0:11:23,341 --> 0:11:24,809
the crazy things that she does?


358
0:11:24,809 --> 0:11:26,1
But I tell you what,


359
0:11:26,1 --> 0:11:33,651
I'm going to find out.


360
0:11:33,651 --> 0:11:35,386
- Hey, girl.


361
0:11:35,386 --> 0:11:37,555
- I'm sorry I'm late.


362
0:11:37,555 --> 0:11:39,56
- Where's the crew?


363
0:11:39,56 --> 0:11:40,791
- No crew today.


364
0:11:40,791 --> 0:11:42,827
- Is everything okay?


365
0:11:42,827 --> 0:11:44,228
- No, not really.


366
0:11:44,228 --> 0:11:47,231
Tam, what did you say
to Lindsay yesterday?


367
0:11:47,231 --> 0:11:48,666
- About?


368
0:11:48,666 --> 0:11:50,635
- About her having
an older brother.


369
0:11:50,635 --> 0:11:55,273
- Look, Suzanne, you and I
both know you got skeletons.


370
0:11:55,273 --> 0:11:56,407
- Skeletons?


371
0:11:56,407 --> 0:11:57,642
- Yeah.


372
0:11:57,642 --> 0:12:2,313
And a couple of our skeletons
share the same bones.


373
0:12:2,313 --> 0:12:3,514
- Andre.


374
0:12:3,514 --> 0:12:5,316
- [Chuckles]


375
0:12:5,316 --> 0:12:7,518
- Ooh, now, that's somebody
I haven't thought about


376
0:12:7,518 --> 0:12:8,553
in a long time.


377
0:12:8,553 --> 0:12:11,88
- I guess not.


378
0:12:11,88 --> 0:12:13,124
So was it true?


379
0:12:13,124 --> 0:12:16,227
Oh, what he said
about why you left?


380
0:12:16,227 --> 0:12:18,362
- Partially.


381
0:12:18,362 --> 0:12:21,966
I did have a scare,
but that's all that it was.


382
0:12:21,966 --> 0:12:23,34
- [Scoffs]


383
0:12:23,34 --> 0:12:25,236
Well, we didn't hear
that part of it.


384
0:12:25,236 --> 0:12:26,571
I mean, the next thing I knew,


385
0:12:26,571 --> 0:12:28,372
you had left in the middle
of the semester,


386
0:12:28,372 --> 0:12:30,274
and I didn't hear
from you ever again.


387
0:12:30,274 --> 0:12:33,244
Look, I just assumed
that you had the baby.


388
0:12:33,244 --> 0:12:35,346
And when you mentioned
that Lindsay had a brother,


389
0:12:35,346 --> 0:12:38,95
I just, you know, two plus two.


390
0:12:38,95 --> 0:12:40,218
Girl, I'm sorry.


391
0:12:40,218 --> 0:12:42,687
- No, no, no.


392
0:12:42,687 --> 0:12:44,121
I'm sorry.


393
0:12:44,121 --> 0:12:45,523
You had to come
in here and admit


394
0:12:45,523 --> 0:12:46,891
that you did it with Andre.


395
0:12:46,891 --> 0:12:48,593
Before that, I used
to have respect for you.


396
0:12:48,593 --> 0:12:51,362
- Oh, no, you
will not go there, okay?


397
0:12:51,362 --> 0:12:52,597
I know your boyfriends,


398
0:12:52,597 --> 0:12:54,232
and you have not always

0:20:8,217 --> 0:20:10,252
- Look, it ain't that bad.


592
0:20:10,252 --> 0:20:11,654
- It is that bad.


593
0:20:11,654 --> 0:20:12,955
Baby, I'm sorry.


594
0:20:12,955 --> 0:20:15,24
I will never let your father
dress you again.


595
0:20:15,24 --> 0:20:17,493
Now, what was the dance
that looked a seizure?


596
0:20:17,493 --> 0:20:20,429
- Oh.


597
0:20:20,429 --> 0:20:21,463
- [Giggling]


598
0:20:21,463 --> 0:20:22,431
- Triple time.


599
0:20:22,431 --> 0:20:23,732
- Oh, that's nice.


600
0:20:23,732 --> 0:20:25,434
Did your father teach you that?


601
0:20:25,434 --> 0:20:26,835
- Yes.
- Hmm.


602
0:20:26,835 --> 0:20:28,504
All right, well,
I think you guys


603
0:20:28,504 --> 0:20:29,872
should probably go to sleep,


604
0:20:29,872 --> 0:20:31,24
so Troy, good night.


605
0:20:31,24 --> 0:20:33,308
- Good night,
Mr. and Mrs. Kingston-persons.


606
0:20:33,308 --> 0:20:36,679
And for the record,
I enjoy Usher.


607
0:20:36,679 --> 0:20:38,747
Especially the <i>confessions</i> era.


608
0:20:38,747 --> 0:20:40,115
You have good taste.


609
0:20:40,115 --> 0:20:45,821
- Thanks.


610
0:20:45,821 --> 0:20:46,955
- Hey.


611
0:20:46,955 --> 0:20:48,857
- So how was coffee?


612
0:20:48,857 --> 0:20:50,726
- Black and cheap.


613
0:20:50,726 --> 0:20:52,461
Just like him.


614
0:20:52,461 --> 0:20:58,1
I'm hungry.
