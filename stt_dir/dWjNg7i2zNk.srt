0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,6
[ Jacque Fresco & Roxanne Meadows - The Venus Project ]


2
0:0:4,6 --> 0:0:8,9
We feel it's really important to do a major motion picture now


3
0:0:8,9 --> 0:0:11,72
to get to the general public,


4
0:0:11,72 --> 0:0:15,74
to introduce to them what science and technology can do


5
0:0:15,74 --> 0:0:17,85
under the direction of the Venus Project,


6
0:0:17,85 --> 0:0:19,76
within a resource-based economy.


7
0:0:19,76 --> 0:0:23,55
I think a motion picture can be played over and over again;


8
0:0:23,55 --> 0:0:27,5
it can be translated into many different languages


9
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:31,15
and it could do far more than my personal lectures


10
0:0:31,15 --> 0:0:34,5
because it travels all over the world.


11
0:0:34,5 --> 0:0:35,652
And in a motion picture


12
0:0:35,652 --> 0:0:38,5
you can answer all the questions that people ask.


13
0:0:38,5 --> 0:0:41,3
We also feel, while Jacque is still alive,


14
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:44,88
he is the best person to put this film together.


15
0:0:44,88 --> 0:0:49,14
He has worked all his life to arrive at this direction.


16
0:0:49,14 --> 0:0:51,5
He hasn't just read books.


17
0:0:51,5 --> 0:0:53,45
He has experimented and worked with people,


18
0:0:53,45 --> 0:0:55,15
and worked with technology


19
0:0:55,15 --> 0:0:58,9
and showed just how a resource-based economy


20
0:0:58,9 --> 0:1:1,3
can function and what it will look like.


21
0:1:1,3 --> 0:1:4,9
So, to us, it's very important to have


22
0:1:4,9 --> 0:1:7,8
Jacque involved in this film.


23
0:1:7,8 --> 0:1:13,5
The basic ideas for the film are laid out precisely,


24
0:1:13,5 --> 0:1:15,75
and they're laid out


25
0:1:15,75 --> 0:1:18,675
in accordance with the plans of the Venus Project.


26
0:1:18,675 --> 0:1:23,9
If you don't have a public prepared to accept the Venus Project...


27
0:1:23,9 --> 0:1:25,6
there is no other way.


28
0:1:25,6 --> 0:1:30,37
All of the future scenarios in science-fiction films


29
0:1:30,37 --> 0:1:33,25
are detrimental, are scary,


30
0:1:33,25 --> 0:1:37,0
are... technology overcoming and killing people,


31
0:1:37,0 --> 0:1:41,79
dictatorial governments and technology watching your every move.


32
0:1:41,79 --> 0:1:44,1
This is quite the opposite of the Venus Project


33
0:1:44,1 --> 0:1:46,1
for anybody who knows about it,


34
0:1:46,1 --> 0:1:48,64
and this is what we want to get across to the public-


35
0:1:48,64 --> 0:1:51,845
that you don't have to be afraid of technology.


36
0:1:51,845 --> 0:1:55,41
We want to show how the methods of science can be used


37
0:1:55,41 --> 0:1:59,27
to enhance everyone's life and preserve the environment.


38
0:1:59,27 --> 0:2:2,0
If we spent the money any other way,


39
0:2:2,0 --> 0:2:4,0
I don't think it would be as effective.


40
0:2:4,0 --> 0:2:8,5
We need a large following to get this implemented.


41
0:2:8,5 --> 0:2:11,7
People don't know what's missing; they don't know any other system.


42
0:2:11,7 --> 0:2:15,37
So we want to show life in a resource based-economy,


43
0:2:15,37 --> 0:2:19,18
then show flashbacks of how we get from here to there,


44
0:2:19,18 --> 0:2:21,34
and do it in a entertaining way


45
0:2:21,34 --> 0:2:23,4
so we could bring the public along with it.


46
0:2:23,4 --> 0:2:28,49
The Venus Project's story is already fairly explicit


47
0:2:28,49 --> 0:2:34,4
and what we need perhaps of a writer is putting it in terms


48
0:2:34,4 --> 0:2:37,85
that might be easily understood or acceptable.


49
0:2:37,85 --> 0:2:41,1
It will have a lot of CGI in it which is expensive


50
0:2:41,1 --> 0:2:43,2
because it does take place in the future.


51
0:2:43,2 --> 0:2:47,37
But it depends on when and what kind of funds we get.


52
0:2:47,37 --> 0:2:50,871
That will dictate, say, the type of script;


53
0:2:50,871 --> 0:2:53,57
the more funding, the more elaboration.


54
0:2:53,57 --> 0:2:57,5
That depends on what people do to help support the project.


55
0:2:57,5 --> 0:3:0,948
We would have information on the internet as to


56
0:3:0,948 --> 0:3:5,74
how much has come in, where it's going to, and we have to do this


57
0:3:5,74 --> 0:3:9,656
because we're aiming to get the donations through our


58
0:3:9,656 --> 0:3:15,24
non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization called Future By Design.


59
0:3:15,24 --> 0:3:18,6
And lawfully, everything has to be transparent and it would be.


60
0:3:18,6 --> 0:3:21,14
If we do make a profit


61
0:3:21,14 --> 0:3:22,95
we will build the first city


62
0:3:22,95 --> 0:3:27,47
or we will do additional films, shorter films, but many of them.


63
0:3:27,47 --> 0:3:29,653
People will walk out of this film


64
0:3:29,653 --> 0:3:32,4
with the definite direction to work towards,


65
0:3:32,4 --> 0:3:36,12
and knowing the difference between what they have today


66
0:3:36,12 --> 0:3:39,68
and the possibilities of the future within a resource-based economy.


67
0:3:39,68 --> 0:3:43,49
We want them to understand it so much so that they walk out and say,


68
0:3:43,49 --> 0:3:46,76
"Why don't we live like this today?"


69
0:3:46,76 --> 0:3:50,8

Thank you
