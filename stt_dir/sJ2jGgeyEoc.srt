1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,37



2
0:0:2,37 --> 0:0:4,72
THOM DEVITA: Do you want
to see Huck's back?


3
0:0:4,72 --> 0:0:5,58
-Yeah, I'd love--


4
0:0:5,58 --> 0:0:7,83
THOM DEVITA: My back
and Huck's tattoo.


5
0:0:7,83 --> 0:0:8,72
-Exactly


6
0:0:8,72 --> 0:0:9,658
THOM DEVITA: Huck Spaulding.


7
0:0:9,658 --> 0:0:12,59
-The collaboration?


8
0:0:12,59 --> 0:0:14,3
THOM DEVITA: All tattoos
are a collaboration.


9
0:0:14,3 --> 0:0:30,72



10
0:0:30,72 --> 0:0:33,4
ROBERT RYAN: Thom's back piece
is probably the most


11
0:0:33,4 --> 0:0:35,23
incredible tattoo
I've ever seen.


12
0:0:35,23 --> 0:0:39,45
And it was the dragon done
by Huck's Spaulding.


13
0:0:39,45 --> 0:0:44,43
I believe, in late '60s,
that tattoo was done.


14
0:0:44,43 --> 0:0:46,87
ED HARDY: And when I first saw
that picture, I was like,


15
0:0:46,87 --> 0:0:48,64
Jesus Christ.


16
0:0:48,64 --> 0:0:50,53
The tattoo world was
so tiny then.


17
0:0:50,53 --> 0:0:54,2
It's just, you can't even convey
how unusual it was to


18
0:0:54,2 --> 0:0:56,624
see any tattoos.


19
0:0:56,624 --> 0:0:58,275
The only people with tattoos
were either in


20
0:0:58,275 --> 0:0:59,655
jail or in the service.


21
0:0:59,655 --> 0:1:3,51
And then seeing big work
just blew my mind.


22
0:1:3,51 --> 0:1:5,76
He forced Huck to do
that that size.


23
0:1:5,76 --> 0:1:8,74
He blew that up, the
Coleman dragon.


24
0:1:8,74 --> 0:1:12,185
And Mike said that Huck really
grumbled about it.


25
0:1:12,185 --> 0:1:13,8
That's too big.


26
0:1:13,8 --> 0:1:16,8
ANGELO SCOTTO: Tattooing years
ago was a lot different.


27
0:1:16,8 --> 0:1:18,166
Totally, totally, totally,
different.


28
0:1:18,166 --> 0:1:20,646
Nobody got big back
pieces back then.


29
0:1:20,646 --> 0:1:22,134
He was ahead of his time.


30
0:1:22,134 --> 0:1:30,7
[MUSIC PLAYING]


31
0:1:30,7 --> 0:1:31,67
CLAYTON PATTERSON: At that
time, tattooing was very


32
0:1:31,67 --> 0:1:32,14
underground.


33
0:1:32,14 --> 0:1:33,57
There were very few
places where you


34
0:1:33,57 --> 0:1:34,66
could learn about it.


35
0:1:34,66 --> 0:1:36,27
And especially if you were a
kid here in New York, when


36
0:1:36,27 --> 0:1:37,55
it's illegal and it's
underground,


37
0:1:37,55 --> 0:1:39,24
there's no place to learn.


38
0:1:39,24 --> 0:1:42,4
NICK BUBASH: We went up and
got tattooed from Huck.


39
0:1:42,4 --> 0:1:45,25
And then Huck Spaulding helped
Thom get started.


40
0:1:45,25 --> 0:1:47,23
That's all you ever did
was help somebody.


41
0:1:47,23 --> 0:1:49,61
You didn't teach anybody
anything.


42
0:1:49,61 --> 0:1:53,16
CLAYTON PATTERSON: DeVita takes
Malone and [INAUDIBLE]


43
0:1:53,16 --> 0:1:56,8
upstate, where Huck
is tattooing.


44
0:1:56,8 --> 0:1:57,33
And Malone takes pictures.


45
0:1:57,33 --> 0:1:59,93



46
0:1:59,93 --> 0:2:2,37
JOHN WYATT: He told me that
he was a photographer.


47
0:2:2,37 --> 0:2:5,9
And he was so blown away by the
tattooing, this is what he


48
0:2:5,9 --> 0:2:8,49
wanted to do instead of
being a photographer.


49
0:2:8,49 --> 0:2:14,24
This is a photograph of Mike
Malone sitting in Thom's chair


50
0:2:14,24 --> 0:2:16,15
on Fourth Street.


51
0:2:16,15 --> 0:2:19,72
They became very, very
good friends.


52
0:2:19,72 --> 0:2:22,4
CLAYTON PATTERSON: And it's who
opens the door for you,


53
0:2:22,4 --> 0:2:26,21
and who turns on the light, is
one of the greatest parts of


54
0:2:26,21 --> 0:2:28,195
your career.


55
0:2:28,195 --> 0:2:30,93
If you look at Malone,
it always


56
0:2:30,93 --> 0:2:32,99
starts with Sailor Jerry.


57
0:2:32,99 --> 0:2:36,63
And that is absolute a big
crock of bullshit.


58
0:2:36,63 --> 0:2:38,24
ED HARDY: DeVita was responsible
for Malone getting


59
0:2:38,24 --> 0:2:40,36
into tattooing, for sure.


60
0:2:40,36 --> 0:2:43,33
And I had started corresponding
with Malone when


61
0:2:43,33 --> 0:2:45,31
I was still at Doc Webb's,
first couple of


62
0:2:45,31 --> 0:2:46,5
years in San Diego.


63
0:2:46,5 --> 0:2:49,2
And then Malone and I really
got along, had a lot of


64
0:2:49,2 --> 0:2:49,64
similar things.


65
0:2:49,64 --> 0:2:51,28
I was like, I'd like
to see New York.


66
0:2:51,28 --> 0:2:52,29
I'd never been there.


67
0:2:52,29 --> 0:2:56,34
Anyway, my first trip
to New York was in,


68
0:2:56,34 --> 0:2:58,91
Christ, maybe '72--


69
0:2:58,91 --> 0:2:59,96
spring of '72--


70
0:2:59,96 --> 0:3:2,63
because I was tattooing a bunch
of wealthy people that


71
0:3:2,63 --> 0:3:4,63
lived there that were getting
custom work, like big


72
0:3:4,63 --> 0:3:7,312
businessmen type that were in
the closet sexually, and they


73
0:3:7,312 --> 0:3:9,7
were in the closet
with the tattoos.


74
0:3:9,7 --> 0:3:11,3
They were positions
of importance.


75
0:3:11,3 --> 0:3:13,85
And the night I got in,
they had a party at


76
0:3:13,85 --> 0:3:16,18
this person's apartment.


77
0:3:16,18 --> 0:3:17,93
And then Malone had said, wait
until you meet deVita.


78
0:3:17,93 --> 0:3:20,86



79
0:3:20,86 --> 0:3:22,915
And then Malone was talking
about deVita's place.


80
0:3:22,915 --> 0:3:25,99
And he said, you won't
believe it.


81
0:3:25,99 --> 0:3:26,91
ANGELO SCOTTO: Thom's
place was--


82
0:3:26,91 --> 0:3:28,805
I've got to say it was
a dangerous area.


83
0:3:28,805 --> 0:3:34,1
The East Village was a bad place
in the '60s and '70s,


84
0:3:34,1 --> 0:3:34,77
very dangerous.


85
0:3:34,77 --> 0:3:37,25
He was on Fourth between
C and D.


86
0:3:37,25 --> 0:3:39,74
CLAYTON PATTERSON: Yeah,
C and D, Coke and Dope.


87
0:3:39,74 --> 0:3:40,59
That's what it stood for.


88
0:3:40,59 --> 0:3:41,88
Where are you going?


89
0:3:41,88 --> 0:3:43,482
It was very dangerous
down here, for one


90
0:3:43,482 --> 0:3:44,2
thing, at that time.


91
0:3:44,2 --> 0:3:45,37
It was totally ghetto.


92
0:3:45,37 --> 0:3:47,15
It was all drugs.


93
0:3:47,15 --> 0:3:51,4
That's the drug capital of
the world at that time.


94
0:3:51,4 --> 0:3:53,77
THOM DEVITA: If you imagine
what it was in the bad


95
0:3:53,77 --> 0:3:56,2
neighborhood, that's
where I lived.


96
0:3:56,2 --> 0:3:59,12



97
0:3:59,12 --> 0:4:0,155
ED HARDY: We'd go down
to see deVita.


98
0:4:0,155 --> 0:4:1,97
We'd get in a cab, and I'd say,
we're going to Fourth


99
0:4:1,97 --> 0:4:5,17
between C and D. And then
we got going Fourth.


100
0:4:5,17 --> 0:4:8,34
And then finally, at about
Avenue A, he said, I'm not


101
0:4:8,34 --> 0:4:9,54
going any further.


102
0:4:9,54 --> 0:4:10,74
I won't take you any further.


103
0:4:10,74 --> 0:4:12,36
It was like Berlin after
the fucking war.


104
0:4:12,36 --> 0:4:13,87
It was like burned out
buildings and shit.


105
0:4:13,87 --> 0:4:16,73
It was just totally crazy.


106
0:4:16,73 --> 0:4:17,91
CLAYTON PATTERSON: If you look
at Lower East Side, Lower East


107
0:4:17,91 --> 0:4:20,269
Side has changed the history
America probably 500 times


108
0:4:20,269 --> 0:4:22,4
with the different people that
have come through here.


109
0:4:22,4 --> 0:4:23,28
It's been massive.


110
0:4:23,28 --> 0:4:25,65
Rothko had a studio down
here, Jackson Pollock,


111
0:4:25,65 --> 0:4:28,3
Jimi Hendrix, Madonna.


112
0:4:28,3 --> 0:4:30,39
It's just endless, the number
of creative people that have


113
0:4:30,39 --> 0:4:32,3
come out of the Lower
East Side.


114
0:4:32,3 --> 0:4:35,31
And the connection to that, the
root to all of that, was


115
0:4:35,31 --> 0:4:37,14
cheap rent and inexpensive
lifestyle.


116
0:4:37,14 --> 0:4:41,326
THOM DEVITA: Our Fourth Street
shop was on the top floor.


117
0:4:41,326 --> 0:4:44,56
I lived downstairs,
on another floor.


118
0:4:44,56 --> 0:4:46,69
ANGELO SCOTTO: But the only
thing is that Thom, he only


119
0:4:46,69 --> 0:4:48,82
took five people a day.


120
0:4:48,82 --> 0:4:51,14
And you had to be there at
7:00 in the morning.


121
0:4:51,14 --> 0:4:52,91
And when you got there at 7:00
in the morning, there was


122
0:4:52,91 --> 0:4:56,5
people waiting for
him on the stoop.


123
0:4:56,5 --> 0:4:58,12
THOM DEVITA: I used to tell
them, you can wake me up at


124
0:4:58,12 --> 0:5:1,13
any time as long as
it's light out.


125
0:5:1,13 --> 0:5:4,18
Just call out my name
very softly.


126
0:5:4,18 --> 0:5:7,32
And I'll hear you because
that's when I wake up.


127
0:5:7,32 --> 0:5:8,68
I'll be ready in one hour.


128
0:5:8,68 --> 0:5:11,0
NICK BUBASH: You had to walk
through his apartment, which


129
0:5:11,0 --> 0:5:13,49
was kind of darkly lit.


130
0:5:13,49 --> 0:5:15,55
So you didn't really get
to see anything.


131
0:5:15,55 --> 0:5:16,86
But it was very mysterious
looking.


132
0:5:16,86 --> 0:5:19,86
There was a lot of things there
that you would want to


133
0:5:19,86 --> 0:5:21,43
stop and look at just
out of curiosity.


134
0:5:21,43 --> 0:5:23,53
But he didn't give
you a chance.


135
0:5:23,53 --> 0:5:26,96
You followed him in to what
was the kitchen of the


136
0:5:26,96 --> 0:5:30,8
apartment, where the
tattoo shop was.


137
0:5:30,8 --> 0:5:36,1
And when I walked into that
place, my mind was blown.


138
0:5:36,1 --> 0:5:39,49
It was walking into
a work of art.


139
0:5:39,49 --> 0:5:41,42
A lot of this stuff
was there then.


140
0:5:41,42 --> 0:5:44,34



141
0:5:44,34 --> 0:5:46,64
ANGELO SCOTTO: Thom had the
best sign I ever seen.


142
0:5:46,64 --> 0:5:49,2
Like I said, he used to go out
at night and look for things.


143
0:5:49,2 --> 0:5:53,54
It said, no bongo drums or
percussion instruments allowed


144
0:5:53,54 --> 0:5:55,65
in the park after dark.


145
0:5:55,65 --> 0:5:59,82
You felt like you were walking
in an art gallery.


146
0:5:59,82 --> 0:6:0,54
I kind of envy that.


147
0:6:0,54 --> 0:6:1,97
I wish I had a shop
similar to that.


148
0:6:1,97 --> 0:6:4,84



149
0:6:4,84 --> 0:6:7,38
NICK BUBASH: He would get
flash from people.


150
0:6:7,38 --> 0:6:9,61
And those things were all
presented on the wall.


151
0:6:9,61 --> 0:6:13,28
The sheet itself was embellished
with ink and


152
0:6:13,28 --> 0:6:17,41
stamps, and he would paste
things on them, and put frames


153
0:6:17,41 --> 0:6:18,71
around them.


154
0:6:18,71 --> 0:6:20,54
He changed everything.


155
0:6:20,54 --> 0:6:23,86
Fuck, he used to say,
our job as artists


156
0:6:23,86 --> 0:6:25,11
is to change things.


157
0:6:25,11 --> 0:6:28,27



158
0:6:28,27 --> 0:6:31,33
Jeez, I think it wasn't until
years later you started seeing


159
0:6:31,33 --> 0:6:35,45
things like that in the Lower
East Side galleries, things


160
0:6:35,45 --> 0:6:38,705
like the collage
constructionism.


161
0:6:38,705 --> 0:6:40,96
You would see things that looked
like what Thom had been


162
0:6:40,96 --> 0:6:44,1
doing 10 years or
15 years ago.


163
0:6:44,1 --> 0:6:46,98
ED HARDY: I never met anybody
that was in tattooing that was


164
0:6:46,98 --> 0:6:48,41
like that at all.


165
0:6:48,41 --> 0:6:51,78
He was working on grape crate
slats, because he said, well,


166
0:6:51,78 --> 0:6:52,36
it's perfect.


167
0:6:52,36 --> 0:6:54,58
They're, like, the
size of an arm.


168
0:6:54,58 --> 0:6:56,94
And I just, I said, this
is your flash?


169
0:6:56,94 --> 0:6:58,22
And he says, yeah.


170
0:6:58,22 --> 0:7:0,18
This is what I do.


171
0:7:0,18 --> 0:7:1,47
I said, what if they
want hot stuff?


172
0:7:1,47 --> 0:7:2,455
Because he didn't have
any cartoons.


173
0:7:2,455 --> 0:7:4,9
And in those days, all
of us were like,


174
0:7:4,9 --> 0:7:5,18
oh shit, more cartoons.


175
0:7:5,18 --> 0:7:7,93
It paid the rent, but you just
get so tired of them.


176
0:7:7,93 --> 0:7:8,59
And then he said, yeah.


177
0:7:8,59 --> 0:7:10,26
I said, well, I tell him,
I've got to get his dad.


178
0:7:10,26 --> 0:7:11,53
And he had a big [? Hanja, ?]


179
0:7:11,53 --> 0:7:14,94
big Japanese demon.


180
0:7:14,94 --> 0:7:16,3
THOM DEVITA: I don't
like cartoons.


181
0:7:16,3 --> 0:7:21,33
All that Mickey Mouse tattoos,
it started in California.


182
0:7:21,33 --> 0:7:23,95
Tattooing is already
cartoonish.


183
0:7:23,95 --> 0:7:26,34
Why make it so obvious?


184
0:7:26,34 --> 0:7:28,75
I like tattoos that
look like tattoos.


185
0:7:28,75 --> 0:7:30,73



186
0:7:30,73 --> 0:7:31,87
ED HARDY: And it just
blew my mind.


187
0:7:31,87 --> 0:7:36,28
It was like, you mean you don't
have to just give them


188
0:7:36,28 --> 0:7:38,43
the main menu?


189
0:7:38,43 --> 0:7:40,2
I was still tattooing sailors.


190
0:7:40,2 --> 0:7:43,25
I was trying to get people to
get something different,


191
0:7:43,25 --> 0:7:43,88
custom work.


192
0:7:43,88 --> 0:7:45,87
I worked for almost nothing
just to get to


193
0:7:45,87 --> 0:7:47,17
do something different.


194
0:7:47,17 --> 0:7:49,27
It just changed my head
around completely.


195
0:7:49,27 --> 0:7:54,4
I saw this stuff, but I didn't
have a plan yet to do a custom


196
0:7:54,4 --> 0:7:57,8
shop, to do what I eventually
did with realistic.


197
0:7:57,8 --> 0:7:57,93
Then I went to Japan.


198
0:7:57,93 --> 0:7:59,65
I shut down the San
Diego shop.


199
0:7:59,65 --> 0:8:3,88
And when I came back, I opened
a place where everything had


200
0:8:3,88 --> 0:8:6,39
to be one of a kind.


201
0:8:6,39 --> 0:8:8,965
And I fucked it up for a lot of
people, because I started


202
0:8:8,965 --> 0:8:10,89
going, well, hey, we can
do whatever you want.


203
0:8:10,89 --> 0:8:14,31
And a lot of tattooers
were not into that.


204
0:8:14,31 --> 0:8:15,94
Then I started inching
the prices up.


205
0:8:15,94 --> 0:8:18,87
When I came back from
Japan, it started


206
0:8:18,87 --> 0:8:21,1
getting more realistic.


207
0:8:21,1 --> 0:8:23,98
And then deVita, he had all
these signs, tattoos need not


208
0:8:23,98 --> 0:8:25,24
be expensive.


209
0:8:25,24 --> 0:8:27,63
And I'm going, Thom, you're
living here in a fucking


210
0:8:27,63 --> 0:8:31,66
burned-out building in this
neighborhood where you don't


211
0:8:31,66 --> 0:8:32,57
have any overhead.


212
0:8:32,57 --> 0:8:34,11
I said, Jesus Christ,
I've got a family.


213
0:8:34,11 --> 0:8:34,809
I'm paying rent.


214
0:8:34,809 --> 0:8:36,94
You don't even know what it is
to be in the real world.


215
0:8:36,94 --> 0:8:39,48
So we we're always going back
and forth about that.


216
0:8:39,48 --> 0:8:40,409
THOM DEVITA: I used
to have a sign


217
0:8:40,409 --> 0:8:44,169
saying, artists pay double.


218
0:8:44,169 --> 0:8:45,31
NICK BUBASH: Yeah, that's true.


219
0:8:45,31 --> 0:8:46,494
He did.


220
0:8:46,494 --> 0:8:47,7
-Were you known for
your designs?


221
0:8:47,7 --> 0:8:48,5
THOM DEVITA: No.


222
0:8:48,5 --> 0:8:53,92
I was known for $30 tattoos.


223
0:8:53,92 --> 0:8:57,79
I had a big room filled
with $30 tattoos.


224
0:8:57,79 --> 0:9:2,32
But I had the smaller room that
had higher price tattoos.


225
0:9:2,32 --> 0:9:3,7
-They were $50.


226
0:9:3,7 --> 0:9:6,6
THOM DEVITA: They were $60.


227
0:9:6,6 --> 0:9:7,95
-A $50 room and a $30 room.


228
0:9:7,95 --> 0:9:9,224
THOM DEVITA: No, $60.


229
0:9:9,224 --> 0:9:10,41
$30.


230
0:9:10,41 --> 0:9:13,18
I can't figure out numbers
that easy.


231
0:9:13,18 --> 0:9:17,69
So I made it $30, $60, $90.


232
0:9:17,69 --> 0:9:20,35
Caught on pretty quick.


233
0:9:20,35 --> 0:9:22,545
NICK BUBASH: People weren't
coming around to get collector


234
0:9:22,545 --> 0:9:23,74
things from him.


235
0:9:23,74 --> 0:9:28,51
He was almost completely doing
the neighborhood guys.


236
0:9:28,51 --> 0:9:29,97
He was in a Puerto Rican
neighborhood.


237
0:9:29,97 --> 0:9:35,51
Some 99% of his customers
were Puerto Rican.


238
0:9:35,51 --> 0:9:36,93
ED HARDY: So I'd go down
there, and I'd


239
0:9:36,93 --> 0:9:38,65
roll my sleeves up.


240
0:9:38,65 --> 0:9:40,91
I had these same tattoos on.


241
0:9:40,91 --> 0:9:43,27
So even though you're like a
Haole guy coming down in


242
0:9:43,27 --> 0:9:46,43
there, and if anybody said
anything, we'd say we're going


243
0:9:46,43 --> 0:9:47,7
to see the tattoo man.


244
0:9:47,7 --> 0:9:49,2
Or sometimes people would
say, you going to


245
0:9:49,2 --> 0:9:49,73
see the tattoo man?


246
0:9:49,73 --> 0:9:52,13
I'd say, yeah, you know.


247
0:9:52,13 --> 0:9:52,95
THOM DEVITA: I'd walk
down there,


248
0:9:52,95 --> 0:9:55,22
and they'd say, tattoo--


249
0:9:55,22 --> 0:9:58,67
tattoo man, "the marker"
in Spanish, the man


250
0:9:58,67 --> 0:10:1,9
that does the marks.


251
0:10:1,9 --> 0:10:3,9
Puerto Ricans just came by
like the Russian guys.


252
0:10:3,9 --> 0:10:6,4
Just come by, and
got a tattoo.


253
0:10:6,4 --> 0:10:11,31
People I'd tattoo didn't
have their bodies done.


254
0:10:11,31 --> 0:10:13,35
-Just their arms.


255
0:10:13,35 --> 0:10:14,71
THOM DEVITA: They want
an eagle over here.


256
0:10:14,71 --> 0:10:18,11
They want a heart over here,
mom and dad over here.


257
0:10:18,11 --> 0:10:20,94
That's the kind of
people I tattoo.


258
0:10:20,94 --> 0:10:22,88
I had designs on the walls.


259
0:10:22,88 --> 0:10:26,21
But nobody picked them out.


260
0:10:26,21 --> 0:10:32,37
I was doing blue collar
workers and


261
0:10:32,37 --> 0:10:35,73
guys who didn't work.


262
0:10:35,73 --> 0:10:36,9
-Is that the monkey king?


263
0:10:36,9 --> 0:10:37,804
THOM DEVITA: Yeah.


264
0:10:37,804 --> 0:10:38,71
-You've done this one before?


265
0:10:38,71 --> 0:10:40,315
THOM DEVITA: That's not
typical of the work


266
0:10:40,315 --> 0:10:42,8
that I would do.


267
0:10:42,8 --> 0:10:47,6
Blue collar guys don't come
up for a monkey king.


268
0:10:47,6 --> 0:10:50,75
Plumbers don't want
monkey king.


269
0:10:50,75 --> 0:10:51,56
Do you understand what I say?


270
0:10:51,56 --> 0:10:53,5
-Yes, sir.


271
0:10:53,5 --> 0:10:54,73
THOM DEVITA: And no customer
ever come in and


272
0:10:54,73 --> 0:10:57,24
said, I want clouds.


273
0:10:57,24 --> 0:10:59,45
I want water.


274
0:10:59,45 --> 0:11:1,12
Couldn't sell them water.


275
0:11:1,12 --> 0:11:5,13
I would sometimes tell them,
would your like some clouds


276
0:11:5,13 --> 0:11:6,92
around the eagle?


277
0:11:6,92 --> 0:11:8,19
Yeah, OK.


278
0:11:8,19 --> 0:11:11,22
I wouldn't even charge them for
it, hoping maybe they'd


279
0:11:11,22 --> 0:11:13,82
get out, and somebody
would come back and


280
0:11:13,82 --> 0:11:15,16
say, I want the clouds.


281
0:11:15,16 --> 0:11:18,655
Then I'd say, that'll
be $30 extra.


282
0:11:18,655 --> 0:11:21,48
ED HARDY: Another thing that
I loved, as a formal


283
0:11:21,48 --> 0:11:24,49
breakthrough, was he would
put that stuff on.


284
0:11:24,49 --> 0:11:25,83
He'd have the panther, right?


285
0:11:25,83 --> 0:11:27,45
The standard panther size.


286
0:11:27,45 --> 0:11:28,34
He'd have the panther.


287
0:11:28,34 --> 0:11:31,2
But then he'd do
the claw marks.


288
0:11:31,2 --> 0:11:34,24
And he'd say, see, then it
fills up that space.


289
0:11:34,24 --> 0:11:39,23
Or he'd do the big spiderwebs
behind it.


290
0:11:39,23 --> 0:11:41,82
NICK BUBASH: He was always
trying to wipe out--


291
0:11:41,82 --> 0:11:44,45
oh, you'll wipe out a whole
forearm with that.


292
0:11:44,45 --> 0:11:45,147
He'd put stuff around it.


293
0:11:45,147 --> 0:11:48,0
By the time he was done for
$30, your whole goddamn


294
0:11:48,0 --> 0:11:50,41
forearm was covered.


295
0:11:50,41 --> 0:11:53,35
ROBERT RYAN: I know his
reasoning for it was to make


296
0:11:53,35 --> 0:11:55,93
people think they were getting
more for their money, even


297
0:11:55,93 --> 0:11:58,1
though they were only paying
$30 for this tattoo.


298
0:11:58,1 --> 0:12:0,9
But really, it's a
dynamic look that


299
0:12:0,9 --> 0:12:2,54
really can't be faked.


300
0:12:2,54 --> 0:12:3,45
You're just stunned.


301
0:12:3,45 --> 0:12:5,4
Wow, look at that.


302
0:12:5,4 --> 0:12:7,16
That's strong.


303
0:12:7,16 --> 0:12:8,81
CLAYTON PATTERSON: If this was
like a traditional situation,


304
0:12:8,81 --> 0:12:10,65
Thom would have probably never
gotten into tattoos.


305
0:12:10,65 --> 0:12:12,53
The only reason that Thom would
be able to become a


306
0:12:12,53 --> 0:12:14,825
tattoo artist, and be the
tattoo artist he is, is


307
0:12:14,825 --> 0:12:17,26
because he was in a place like
the Lower East Side.


308
0:12:17,26 --> 0:12:19,24
They thought, wow, it's
a great tattoo.


309
0:12:19,24 --> 0:12:22,26
They're not part of the classic
tattoo lineage.


310
0:12:22,26 --> 0:12:24,65
So they have a tattoo, which
they think is powerful and


311
0:12:24,65 --> 0:12:26,13
great and unique.


312
0:12:26,13 --> 0:12:27,99
But it's for this section of
the people, who are drug


313
0:12:27,99 --> 0:12:30,1
dealers, and junkies,
and whatever.


314
0:12:30,1 --> 0:12:32,202
Thom would be nowhere
without that.


315
0:12:32,202 --> 0:12:36,23
ROBERT RYAN: To me, it's high
art, in some of the craziest


316
0:12:36,23 --> 0:12:37,25
conditions.


317
0:12:37,25 --> 0:12:39,24
He was bringing to that
neighborhood what


318
0:12:39,24 --> 0:12:40,85
people could afford.


319
0:12:40,85 --> 0:12:43,7
And it was illegal.


320
0:12:43,7 --> 0:12:47,75
So there was risks at every
corner and turn.


321
0:12:47,75 --> 0:12:51,87
And he's just doing this
really beautiful stuff.


322
0:12:51,87 --> 0:12:54,972
He really was a tattooer for
the people at that time.


323
0:12:54,972 --> 0:12:56,34
And I think that's so cool.


324
0:12:56,34 --> 0:12:59,131
And I think people really liked
him for that, as well,


325
0:12:59,131 --> 0:13:0,604
and respected him for that.


326
0:13:0,604 --> 0:13:5,3



327
0:13:5,3 --> 0:13:7,67
THOM DEVITA: There was one guy,
a Puerto Rican, his name


328
0:13:7,67 --> 0:13:9,782
was Ralphie.


329
0:13:9,782 --> 0:13:12,946
I done quite a few tattoos
on his arm.


330
0:13:12,946 --> 0:13:15,93
And we had no electricity and
no air conditioning, because


331
0:13:15,93 --> 0:13:22,0
the one who was in control of
the basement shut it all off.


332
0:13:22,0 --> 0:13:24,695
So [? Jenny ?] went out and
bought me short pants.


333
0:13:24,695 --> 0:13:28,14
And Ralphie is standing
on the corner.


334
0:13:28,14 --> 0:13:32,888
And he couldn't believe that
my legs, they're solid.


335
0:13:32,888 --> 0:13:36,695
And he looked, and
he's so stunned.


336
0:13:36,695 --> 0:13:42,7
He says, Thom-- he pronounced
the H in Thom.


337
0:13:42,7 --> 0:13:43,45
Thom--


338
0:13:43,45 --> 0:13:46,855
I don't even know how to do it,
but he pronounced the H.


339
0:13:46,855 --> 0:13:51,8
He said, Thom, we are
proud of you.


340
0:13:51,8 --> 0:13:54,79



341
0:13:54,79 --> 0:15:54,79
Thom, he says, we are
proud of you.
