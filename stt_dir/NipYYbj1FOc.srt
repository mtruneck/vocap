2
0:0:33,7 --> 0:0:35,807
Bernard! It's nearly on! Come on.


3
0:0:35,807 --> 0:0:39,167
- What's on?
- It. Come on!


4
0:0:39,167 --> 0:0:44,7
(American) You happy? You happy now?
Here's your goddamn book store.


5
0:0:44,7 --> 0:0:46,207
Nyuh nyuh nyuh nyuh nyuh.


6
0:0:46,207 --> 0:0:50,527
Hey, mister. You got anything
on armouries, weaponry?


7
0:0:50,527 --> 0:0:52,967
Military history is on your right.


8
0:0:52,967 --> 0:0:56,7
I don't want your little history grotto.


9
0:0:56,7 --> 0:1:0,687
I want modern warfare.
Infrared. Fallout. Kill zones.


10
0:1:0,687 --> 0:1:7,887
On your right. If you need help,
fire some rounds into the ceiling.


11
0:1:7,887 --> 0:1:9,327
Bernard...


12
0:1:9,327 --> 0:1:15,567
Ow!


13
0:1:15,567 --> 0:1:18,167
- £30.
- Hey, that's expensive!


14
0:1:18,167 --> 0:1:26,607
Will you shut up
and pay the Scotch man?


15
0:1:26,607 --> 0:1:29,407
Come on. Come on.


16
0:1:29,407 --> 0:1:31,607
(Splutters) Come on.


17
0:1:31,607 --> 0:1:35,407
- What?
- Come on!


18
0:1:35,407 --> 0:1:39,487
It's Grand National day.
Look, I got us a runner each.


19
0:1:39,487 --> 0:1:44,167
Is this what you spend your
pocket money on - filthy gambling?


20
0:1:44,167 --> 0:1:46,207
It's not really gambling.


21
0:1:46,207 --> 0:1:49,847
It's a moment when
the whole nation comes together,


22
0:1:49,847 --> 0:1:52,887
like the opening
of a Richard Curtis movie


23
0:1:52,887 --> 0:1:55,487
or the manhunt for a serial killer.


24
0:1:55,487 --> 0:1:58,887
You're Inner Space and I'm Herr Schmidt.


25
0:1:58,887 --> 0:2:1,527
Eh?


26
0:2:1,527 --> 0:2:4,607
And they're off! Look!
Come on, come on.


27
0:2:4,607 --> 0:2:8,287
Over they go.
Come on, boy, girl, or whatever you are.


28
0:2:8,287 --> 0:2:12,567
- Oh, he fell.
- What happens when they fall?


29
0:2:12,567 --> 0:2:17,47
They give them oats, then shoot them
in the head. But yours is still in.


30
0:2:17,47 --> 0:2:23,887
You put our money on
this circus of death. You disgust me!


31
0:2:23,887 --> 0:2:27,927
Come on! Come on!
Come on, you... Jimmy! Jimmy!


32
0:2:27,927 --> 0:2:29,527
Come on.


33
0:2:29,527 --> 0:2:34,567
(TV) '... at eight to one
wins the Grand National.'


34
0:2:34,567 --> 0:2:38,167
Bernard, you came second
but I put on an each-way bet.


35
0:2:38,167 --> 0:2:42,87
- That means you still win.
- I win?


36
0:2:42,87 --> 0:2:44,567
- How much?
- Well, let me see.


37
0:2:44,567 --> 0:2:49,767
It was 12-1, but it was
an each-way so... (Mumbling)


38
0:2:49,767 --> 0:2:53,727
£1.50.


39
0:2:53,727 --> 0:2:57,767
- How do I collect it?
- You take the slip back. I'll do it.


40
0:2:57,767 --> 0:3:1,567
All right.


41
0:3:1,567 --> 0:3:5,647
- Now, listen.
- Wh...?


42
0:3:5,647 --> 0:3:10,807
- Don't. Lose. This.
- (Yelps)


43
0:3:10,807 --> 0:3:21,327
(Breathes heavily)


44
0:3:21,327 --> 0:3:24,527
Yah! All I need is some kind of system.


45
0:3:24,527 --> 0:3:27,7
Tuh! There's only one system -


46
0:3:27,7 --> 0:3:30,287
bet, lose, borrow, steal,


47
0:3:30,287 --> 0:3:34,607
lose, take the drugs... Iose, prison,


48
0:3:34,607 --> 0:3:36,647
death.


49
0:3:36,647 --> 0:3:39,247
Don't get pious, you started me off.


50
0:3:39,247 --> 0:3:42,807
That's just a flutter.
This is Satan's bingo.


51
0:3:42,807 --> 0:3:45,927
- Well, I was born to win.
- Oh, yeah?


52
0:3:45,927 --> 0:3:49,447
- All right, heads or tails?
- Heads.


53
0:3:49,447 --> 0:3:51,687
All right, I'll give you that one.


54
0:3:51,687 --> 0:3:54,927
- Right, here we go.
- Tails.


55
0:3:54,927 --> 0:3:57,287
You had two kisses from Lady Luck.


56
0:3:57,287 --> 0:4:0,367
Now she's gonna
knee you in the rattlers.


57
0:4:0,367 --> 0:4:4,47
- Tails.
- Yeah, but sooner or later...


58
0:4:4,47 --> 0:4:7,967
I'll run out of money.
Fran, have you got a pound?


59
0:4:7,967 --> 0:4:12,287
No. Can't waste money. Gotta get
a new outfit for my job interview.


60
0:4:12,287 --> 0:4:15,527
I'm feeling confident.
I'm gonna get this job.


61
0:4:15,527 --> 0:4:17,567
You don't stand a chance.


62
0:4:17,567 --> 0:4:21,287
Nobody would employ you
because you're unemployable.


63
0:4:21,287 --> 0:4:28,407
I'd like to help you but I can't,
because you're so totally useless.


64
0:4:28,407 --> 0:4:31,447
You could let me
do a couple of days here.


65
0:4:31,447 --> 0:4:33,927
Then I can say I'm currently working.


66
0:4:33,927 --> 0:4:36,447
We could work together. It'd be fun.


67
0:4:36,447 --> 0:4:40,487
We could read magazines and speculate
about famous people's sexuality.


68
0:4:40,487 --> 0:4:45,7
This place is already
riddled with life-sucking parasites.


69
0:4:45,7 --> 0:4:48,447
Oh, give me a job. Just till the interview.


70
0:4:48,447 --> 0:4:52,607
No, Fran, he's changed.
He's on the gee-gees now.


71
0:4:52,607 --> 0:4:59,887
Bernard.


72
0:4:59,887 --> 0:5:2,727
Bernard!


73
0:5:2,727 --> 0:5:6,567
I bet you...


74
0:5:6,567 --> 0:5:11,607
20 quid I'm so hopeless
I never get another job ever.


75
0:5:11,607 --> 0:5:34,647
I'll give you a job.
You start tomorrow. Ha! Ha! Ha!


76
0:5:34,647 --> 0:5:37,967
- Colleague.
- Co-worker.


77
0:5:37,967 --> 0:5:43,287
Right. You, keep an eye on her.
And you, keep an eye on him.


78
0:5:43,287 --> 0:5:47,647
I've got a universe to master.


79
0:5:47,647 --> 0:5:50,7
The boss is away. Even better!


80
0:5:50,7 --> 0:5:54,47
- I brought croissants.
- Hooray!


81
0:5:54,47 --> 0:5:57,967
Aha... So, what did you see
on TV last night?


82
0:5:57,967 --> 0:6:1,847
Didn't watch it.
Don't watch much TV. What about you?


83
0:6:1,847 --> 0:6:9,567
No. Wasn't much on.


84
0:6:9,567 --> 0:6:24,247
(Racing commentary)


85
0:6:24,247 --> 0:6:29,607
"Please may I have a bet
on Via Appia in the Lingfield race


86
0:6:29,607 --> 0:6:33,207
"at 3:30 this afternoon? Thank you.


87
0:6:33,207 --> 0:6:36,887
"I will bet ten pounds
that this horse wins.


88
0:6:36,887 --> 0:6:40,887
"Here is my ten pounds. Thank you.


89
0:6:40,887 --> 0:6:46,287
"I hope it wins.
Yours faithfully, Bernard Black."


90
0:6:46,287 --> 0:6:56,247
(AII laughing)


91
0:6:56,247 --> 0:7:1,527
Now, this is the desk
and this is the chair.


92
0:7:1,527 --> 0:7:4,887
- I know. Now, I thought...
- Don't interrupt.


93
0:7:4,887 --> 0:7:8,687
This is the till and this stays on the desk.


94
0:7:8,687 --> 0:7:11,727
- The chair remains next to the desk.
- Stop.


95
0:7:11,727 --> 0:7:15,567
This is a woman who ran
her own business for years.


96
0:7:15,567 --> 0:7:20,287
- Come on, there's work to do.
- You're keen. I like that.


97
0:7:20,287 --> 0:7:25,287
But wait. This is the book.


98
0:7:25,287 --> 0:7:28,887
Now, when we make a sale,
it goes in the book.


99
0:7:28,887 --> 0:7:31,607
The title goes here, the cost goes here.


100
0:7:31,607 --> 0:7:35,527
At the end of the day, we add up.


101
0:7:35,527 --> 0:7:37,647
Where's the running total?


102
0:7:37,647 --> 0:7:41,527
- It... You don't need one.
- We'll keep a running total.


103
0:7:41,527 --> 0:7:45,607
- There's no column for it.
- Yes, there is.


104
0:7:45,607 --> 0:7:50,287
The... the... the book! The book!


105
0:7:50,287 --> 0:7:52,727
Come on! Come on! Yes!


106
0:7:52,727 --> 0:7:56,487
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!


107
0:7:56,487 --> 0:8:2,687
Bastard!


108
0:8:2,687 --> 0:8:5,7
- Bad day?
- No, it's good.


109
0:8:5,7 --> 0:8:7,287
I've had it with this caper.


110
0:8:7,287 --> 0:8:11,407
So you haven't stuck anything
on Au Naturel in the five o'clock.


111
0:8:11,407 --> 0:8:20,967
- Shame. Can't lose.
- Yeah, yeah.


112
0:8:20,967 --> 0:8:23,967
Why can't it... we lose?


113
0:8:23,967 --> 0:8:28,407
It loves the soft. The jockey has
only eaten minted peas for a month


114
0:8:28,407 --> 0:8:36,527
and they're trying
to put his house on the race.


115
0:8:36,527 --> 0:8:40,7
- Au Naturel in the five o'clock.
- That's 100-1.


116
0:8:40,7 --> 0:8:43,647
What? No, no.


117
0:8:43,647 --> 0:8:46,807
- Which horse, then?
- Erm... French Pie.


118
0:8:46,807 --> 0:8:50,847
You think it's the right decision -
you're giving me that look.


119
0:8:50,847 --> 0:8:55,47
Wryly amused and also
faintly disgusted and depressed.


120
0:8:55,47 --> 0:8:57,647
There you go, French Pie.


121
0:8:57,647 --> 0:9:1,767
(TV) 'And it's Au Naturel,
the winner by six lengths.


122
0:9:1,767 --> 0:9:6,447
'Over to Newbury for the six o'clock.'


123
0:9:6,447 --> 0:9:13,607
You should have listened.
Still, no big thing, eh?


124
0:9:13,607 --> 0:9:17,807
- She drew a line with a big, blue...
- He's useless, he has no idea...


125
0:9:17,807 --> 0:9:23,527
Silence! Nobody can speak
unless they're holding... this pencil.


126
0:9:23,527 --> 0:9:28,527
- May I have the pencil? I wish to speak.
- No.


127
0:9:28,527 --> 0:9:32,7
Now, it has come
to my attention this morning,


128
0:9:32,7 --> 0:9:37,127
while reviewing my portfolio, that
I cannot afford to pay two employees.


129
0:9:37,127 --> 0:9:43,407
- That's not fair cos...
- An interesting situation.


130
0:9:43,407 --> 0:9:45,567
So, what I'm prepared to do is


131
0:9:45,567 --> 0:9:49,607
you can have a week in which
to sell as many books as possible.


132
0:9:49,607 --> 0:9:53,647
Whoever sells the most gets to keep
the one job I am offering.


133
0:9:53,647 --> 0:9:58,327
- That's not fair. I would...
- And the most important point is...


134
0:9:58,327 --> 0:10:2,167
Whenever you see me -
I can't stress this enough -


135
0:10:2,167 --> 0:10:6,967
you give me, immediately,
all the money.


136
0:10:6,967 --> 0:10:9,527
He has no idea what money looks like.


137
0:10:9,527 --> 0:10:20,167
She's messing up the whole system.


138
0:10:20,167 --> 0:10:41,487
- Bernard...
- It's not fair because...


139
0:10:41,487 --> 0:10:44,807
- I saw her first.
- The bitch is mine.


140
0:10:44,807 --> 0:10:48,687
Wuh...


141
0:10:48,687 --> 0:10:51,127
Hi. Can I help?


142
0:10:51,127 --> 0:10:56,407
- I'm looking for a light holiday read.
- Perhaps these may appeal.


143
0:10:56,407 --> 0:11:24,47
Browse me.


144
0:11:24,47 --> 0:11:34,647
Money. Now.


145
0:11:34,647 --> 0:11:38,327
It's my interview tomorrow,
so we have to shut the shop.


146
0:11:38,327 --> 0:11:41,487
- It's not fair otherwise.
- Objection!


147
0:11:41,487 --> 0:11:44,607
Upheld. Books must be sold,
money made.


148
0:11:44,607 --> 0:11:53,927
Ha! You're toast. T-O-E-A-R-S-T.
Toearst.


149
0:11:53,927 --> 0:11:55,967
All yours.


150
0:11:55,967 --> 0:11:59,727
- What's the next race?
- There's none. We're closing.


151
0:11:59,727 --> 0:12:2,87
I can't stop now, I'm winning.


152
0:12:2,87 --> 0:12:5,127
We'll make our own race,
you against Pat.


153
0:12:5,127 --> 0:12:7,967
I'll put 60 quid on you,
you look nippy.


154
0:12:7,967 --> 0:12:12,167
We're closing.


155
0:12:12,167 --> 0:12:14,727
It's always the same, isn't it?


156
0:12:14,727 --> 0:12:17,767
Just when you break your streak.


157
0:12:17,767 --> 0:12:20,647
- D'you ever play poker?
- Hm? No.


158
0:12:20,647 --> 0:12:24,487
No, I can never remember the rules.


159
0:12:24,487 --> 0:12:27,567
Although... No.


160
0:12:27,567 --> 0:12:33,487
- Shame. There's a game tomorrow.
- Really? Where? Near? Far? Where?


161
0:12:33,487 --> 0:12:35,967
Just... You know Dante's mini-cabs?


162
0:12:35,967 --> 0:12:39,7
- Yeah.
- It's big money. 9am.


163
0:12:39,7 --> 0:12:48,207
I'll see you there.


164
0:12:48,207 --> 0:12:50,607
- Who knows how to play poker?
- Me.


165
0:12:50,607 --> 0:12:54,87
You're gonna teach me.
I've got 12 hours to learn.


166
0:12:54,87 --> 0:12:56,487
- Who's got cards?
- Me. In my room.


167
0:12:56,487 --> 0:12:58,527
Good. You can play as well.


168
0:12:58,527 --> 0:13:0,847
- Who's doing nothing?
- Me.


169
0:13:0,847 --> 0:13:3,207
Good. You can fetch the cards.


170
0:13:3,207 --> 0:13:12,927
And then... I have spoken!


171
0:13:12,927 --> 0:13:15,367
OK, the first thing about poker...


172
0:13:15,367 --> 0:13:19,407
Wait. We need whisky,
like in the movies. And background jazz.


173
0:13:19,407 --> 0:13:23,927
You. Mr guy. Whisky, jazz.


174
0:13:23,927 --> 0:13:29,247
Right. I've got a seven, a two,
two queens and a nine.


175
0:13:29,247 --> 0:13:32,527
Well, I've got... an ace.


176
0:13:32,527 --> 0:13:34,687
- And?
- And a king.


177
0:13:34,687 --> 0:13:36,727
And a two. And a seven.


178
0:13:36,727 --> 0:13:49,847
And... Mrs Bun, the baker's wife.


179
0:13:49,847 --> 0:13:54,87
(# Mellow jazz)


180
0:13:54,87 --> 0:13:59,287
- We'll say Mrs Bun is another ace.
- Hah! I win.


181
0:13:59,287 --> 0:14:2,687
- No, I win. Three of a kind.
- What's that?


182
0:14:2,687 --> 0:14:5,727
A pair, two pair,
three of a kind, a run, a flush,


183
0:14:5,727 --> 0:14:8,807
full house, four of a kind,
straight flush, royal flush.


184
0:14:8,807 --> 0:14:11,927
- How do you know all that?
- My grandad taught me.


185
0:14:11,927 --> 0:14:15,887
Then my granny taught me how to cheat.
Before she got shot in Reno.


186
0:14:15,887 --> 0:14:34,807
- Teach me to cheat. It's quicker.
- It's not. You have to rig the deck.


187
0:14:34,807 --> 0:14:37,927
- You try.
- Yeah, well.


188
0:14:37,927 --> 0:14:42,367
That looked pretty easy, actually.


189
0:14:42,367 --> 0:15:20,687
Pull that and...


190
0:15:20,687 --> 0:15:23,847
Bernard. In you come.


191
0:15:23,847 --> 0:15:25,967
Everyone, this is Bernard.


192
0:15:25,967 --> 0:15:28,367
Bernard, this is everyone.


193
0:15:28,367 --> 0:15:30,767
This is Mickey "One Eye" Swayne.


194
0:15:30,767 --> 0:15:32,887
"Undertaker" Jones.


195
0:15:32,887 --> 0:15:36,327
- Lily "The Dazzler" Thompson.
- Hello.


196
0:15:36,327 --> 0:15:41,927
Jimmy "The Illustrated, Blind, Solid
Silver Bitch" Stakopopolips III.


197
0:15:41,927 --> 0:15:52,207
- Oh. Right.
- And Dave "Mouse Ear" Smith.


198
0:15:52,207 --> 0:15:55,927
Dealer's choice.
We're playing Lebanese Southern Cross.


199
0:15:55,927 --> 0:15:59,527
40/80 the ante, fives and twos are wilds.
No raising before the button.


200
0:15:59,527 --> 0:16:3,567
I don't want any show-boating,
coffee-housing, auntie's drawers.


201
0:16:3,567 --> 0:16:9,567
Minimum three aces to start.
Minimum bet one ton. Let's play.


202
0:16:9,567 --> 0:16:13,607
- I don't know if I'm ready for this.
- Just be sure I can see your cards.


203
0:16:13,607 --> 0:16:18,327
- I'll tell you when to bet.
- Would you?


204
0:16:18,327 --> 0:16:24,87
Thanks very much. Call again.


205
0:16:24,87 --> 0:16:26,647
Ah. Did you win or lose?


206
0:16:26,647 --> 0:16:28,767
It's hard to say.


207
0:16:28,767 --> 0:16:32,127
All right. Have you got
more money or less money?


208
0:16:32,127 --> 0:16:35,687
- That's complicated.
- You've got no money.


209
0:16:35,687 --> 0:16:38,327
Yeah.


210
0:16:38,327 --> 0:16:40,927
- What is the problem?
- No problem.


211
0:16:40,927 --> 0:16:45,847
If you want to put on a bet of one pound,
I'll be glad to accept that bet.


212
0:16:45,847 --> 0:16:52,607
As soon as you can find the other 93p.


213
0:16:52,607 --> 0:16:55,647
Bernard. Next game, three o'clock today.


214
0:16:55,647 --> 0:16:57,727
Forget it, I'm cleaned out.


215
0:16:57,727 --> 0:16:59,847
That's no big thing.


216
0:16:59,847 --> 0:17:4,447
Let's nip to my office, have a diet yogurt
and maybe I can help you out.


217
0:17:4,447 --> 0:17:15,767
No, I couldn't do that. No.


218
0:17:15,767 --> 0:17:19,727
- The thing is, mate, you need a bankroll.
- Yeah, I had some good cards.


219
0:17:19,727 --> 0:17:22,967
Just not in the right hand
or in the right order.


220
0:17:22,967 --> 0:17:27,7
Your moves were amazing. You kept
on losing but you kept on going.


221
0:17:27,7 --> 0:17:30,607
That's what makes a gambler.
That crowd were scared.


222
0:17:30,607 --> 0:17:33,647
- They've already got a nickname for you.
- Really?


223
0:17:33,647 --> 0:17:35,687
Usually it takes years.


224
0:17:35,687 --> 0:17:38,487
- What, like Tex or Doc or...?
- No.


225
0:17:38,487 --> 0:17:43,487
They call you The Gold Mine.


226
0:17:43,487 --> 0:17:47,47
Bernard, I can help you
but I need some cover.


227
0:17:47,47 --> 0:17:49,327
I don't have a car or anything.


228
0:17:49,327 --> 0:17:54,127
- Any stock or business concern?
- No. I...


229
0:17:54,127 --> 0:17:57,447
I dunno. A shop?


230
0:17:57,447 --> 0:17:59,767
Would... would a shop do?


231
0:17:59,767 --> 0:18:5,647
Well, seeing as it's you... sign there.


232
0:18:5,647 --> 0:18:7,967
How much should I borrow? Thousand?


233
0:18:7,967 --> 0:18:20,567
- Or 10,000.
- Or 10... 10,000.


234
0:18:20,567 --> 0:18:25,87
- Oh.
- We're closed. Oh, it's you. Sorry.


235
0:18:25,87 --> 0:18:27,367
Why aren't you selling books?


236
0:18:27,367 --> 0:18:33,527
My head'll explode if we do.


237
0:18:33,527 --> 0:18:35,887
You know what Bernard's done?


238
0:18:35,887 --> 0:18:38,207
He's played us off against each other


239
0:18:38,207 --> 0:18:41,567
- to feed his filthy habit.
- You're right.


240
0:18:41,567 --> 0:18:45,687
- How was the job interview?
- Oh, un... brilliant.


241
0:18:45,687 --> 0:18:49,767
Staying awake till 8am
drinking whisky and teaching poker


242
0:18:49,767 --> 0:18:52,87
was not strictly tactical.


243
0:18:52,87 --> 0:18:54,767
I fell asleep in the lobby.


244
0:18:54,767 --> 0:18:59,47
At least you didn't punch anyone
and puke up in your handbag.


245
0:18:59,47 --> 0:19:10,47
(Chuckles)


246
0:19:10,47 --> 0:19:14,247
- Fold.
- Call.


247
0:19:14,247 --> 0:19:17,687
Hm.


248
0:19:17,687 --> 0:19:23,247
OK. A th... th... thousand.


249
0:19:23,247 --> 0:19:27,687
- Call it.
- Fold.


250
0:19:27,687 --> 0:19:31,327
- I'll call your grand.
- I'll call.


251
0:19:31,327 --> 0:19:33,367
- Fold.
- (Coughs)


252
0:19:33,367 --> 0:19:40,607
- Call.
- (Coughs)


253
0:19:40,607 --> 0:19:43,167
So, what have you got, big boy?


254
0:19:43,167 --> 0:19:45,447
These ones.


255
0:19:45,447 --> 0:19:48,407
(Snorts)


256
0:19:48,407 --> 0:19:57,327
They won't beat a full house,
aces on sevens.


257
0:19:57,327 --> 0:20:0,287
- Unlucky, Mouse.
- You out, then?


258
0:20:0,287 --> 0:20:3,967
- No. Can you front me another 100?
- Piss off.


259
0:20:3,967 --> 0:20:6,607
- Come on, a hundred quid.
- No.


260
0:20:6,607 --> 0:20:11,607
You're out of the game now, Bernard.
You've got six hours to pay.


261
0:20:11,607 --> 0:20:16,567
So, it's the ten grand
plus 100%/% interest. That's 20.


262
0:20:16,567 --> 0:20:30,687
Or your shop. Or your legs.


263
0:20:30,687 --> 0:20:34,727
You know what'll happen?
He'll come in and he'll say...


264
0:20:34,727 --> 0:20:40,447
"Fran, Manny, help me. I'm in trouble."


265
0:20:40,447 --> 0:20:44,247
- Fran, Manny, help me...
- Hi. Are you in trouble?


266
0:20:44,247 --> 0:20:48,87
Yeah. I have to find... 20 grand.


267
0:20:48,87 --> 0:20:50,127
In the next six hours.


268
0:20:50,127 --> 0:20:54,447
Or, er, get evicted from my shop.


269
0:20:54,447 --> 0:20:57,127
Or my legs. Erm...


270
0:20:57,127 --> 0:21:0,967
So don't... For now we'll just think.
We'll think...


271
0:21:0,967 --> 0:21:3,327
You happy now? We found it again.


272
0:21:3,327 --> 0:21:6,47
I don't like this book. I want a refund.


273
0:21:6,47 --> 0:21:13,287
No. Go away, we're closed!
Bugger off back to Australia!


274
0:21:13,287 --> 0:21:15,327
What am I gonna do?


275
0:21:15,327 --> 0:21:19,647
Manny, d'you still have those funny
sunglasses you got in Whitstable?


276
0:21:19,647 --> 0:21:22,887
Yeah, in the bathroom.
You think they're funny?


277
0:21:22,887 --> 0:21:25,207
I'm gonna be homeless. And short.


278
0:21:25,207 --> 0:21:28,127
- And you're chatting!
- Relax.


279
0:21:28,127 --> 0:21:32,447
Everything's gonna be fine.


280
0:21:32,447 --> 0:21:36,7
(Racing commentary)


281
0:21:36,7 --> 0:21:39,207
(American accent)
Look, a real English bookie's.


282
0:21:39,207 --> 0:21:43,7
You happy now?
All day long in Madame Tussaud's.


283
0:21:43,7 --> 0:21:46,47
I miss the action, yadda-yadda.


284
0:21:46,47 --> 0:21:51,127
What's this? This is no good.
What is this with the tiny televisions?


285
0:21:51,127 --> 0:21:53,847
Let's go someplace we can play cards.


286
0:21:53,847 --> 0:21:56,807
Why d'you wanna play cards? You lose.


287
0:21:56,807 --> 0:22:0,767
Ah, come on. I saw The Tower,
the goddamn queen.


288
0:22:0,767 --> 0:22:3,927
Hello. Sorry, I couldn't help overhearing.


289
0:22:3,927 --> 0:22:7,967
If you're interested,
there is a little game on this afternoon.


290
0:22:7,967 --> 0:22:11,527
Anything. Anything to make him shut up.


291
0:22:11,527 --> 0:22:14,807
Could I sit in to see
he doesn't lose too much?


292
0:22:14,807 --> 0:22:16,847
100 grand here, 100 grand there...


293
0:22:16,847 --> 0:22:28,207
- It adds up.
- That's not a problem.


294
0:22:28,207 --> 0:22:33,727
OK, you can have this on one condition.
You never... gamble again.


295
0:22:33,727 --> 0:22:37,327
- OK, I won't. Give, give.
- Uh-uh-uh.


296
0:22:37,327 --> 0:22:41,527
You must swear that from now on
you will lead a wholesome life.


297
0:22:41,527 --> 0:22:46,7
You will stick to a modest range
of breakfast wines.


298
0:22:46,7 --> 0:22:49,327
At table, you will use
at least a knife and a fork.


299
0:22:49,327 --> 0:22:53,967
And your hand will fondle
not card nor dice nor the gelding.


300
0:22:53,967 --> 0:22:58,767
OK, OK. I swear! Can you come on?
I've got about 20 minutes


301
0:22:58,767 --> 0:23:4,47
before I'm scratching my stumps
in a cardboard box.


302
0:23:4,47 --> 0:23:8,207
Can I just say you were fantastic
back there?


303
0:23:8,207 --> 0:23:11,727
- Really? No, you were the star.
- No, you were.


304
0:23:11,727 --> 0:23:15,807
When I said, "What's that big,
famous clock by the river?"


305
0:23:15,807 --> 0:23:19,247
- And you said...
- I said, "You know, Big Bill."


306
0:23:19,247 --> 0:23:21,287
That was class.


307
0:23:21,287 --> 0:23:25,127
And you, don't blow it, OK?
Just act casual.


308
0:23:25,127 --> 0:23:31,127
They don't call me The Gold Mine
for nothing.


309
0:23:31,127 --> 0:23:35,607
19,980, 20,000. All there.


310
0:23:35,607 --> 0:23:39,967
- Er... where'd you get it all from?
- Oh, I broke my streak.


311
0:23:39,967 --> 0:23:42,327
I got lucky on a horse.


312
0:23:42,327 --> 0:23:44,407
What's it called?


313
0:23:44,407 --> 0:23:46,687
Hm? Oh, what was it?


314
0:23:46,687 --> 0:23:50,87
Erm... Big Bill.


315
0:23:50,87 --> 0:23:58,0
Right.


316
