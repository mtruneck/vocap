MALE SPEAKER: Just camping--


3
0:0:14,35 --> 0:0:16,149
that was super fun.


4
0:0:16,149 --> 0:0:17,83
The beach camping was awesome.


5
0:0:17,83 --> 0:0:22,42
Because it was, like, a Mad Max
type of vibe, just with


6
0:0:22,42 --> 0:0:25,697
all those big trees, a bunch
of those trunks and stuff.


7
0:0:25,697 --> 0:0:29,673

11
0:0:34,97 --> 0:0:43,33
BRIAN ANDERSON: It's I guess a
little cliche or predictable.


12
0:0:43,33 --> 0:0:43,824
But, yeah.


13
0:0:43,824 --> 0:0:47,8
This is breakfast.


14
0:0:47,8 --> 0:0:48,55
Just doing the cleaning.

0:1:2,76 --> 0:1:3,76
MALE SPEAKER: There it is.

0:1:7,36 --> 0:1:8,12
MALE SPEAKER: It's back on.


22
0:1:8,12 --> 0:1:10,6
MALE SPEAKER: Who's got
the potato on here?


23
0:1:10,6 --> 0:1:11,18
BRIAN ANDERSON: It's mine.


24
0:1:11,18 --> 0:1:12,268
I'm about to pull it.


25
0:1:12,268 --> 0:1:14,85



26
0:1:14,85 --> 0:1:16,1
I'm looking for a plate.


27
0:1:16,1 --> 0:1:21,283



28
0:1:21,283 --> 0:1:25,72
That is a hot potato.


29
0:1:25,72 --> 0:1:27,83
MALE SPEAKER: It's already
like ketched-up.


30
0:1:27,83 --> 0:1:29,125
BRIAN ANDERSON: It's
delicious.


31
0:1:29,125 --> 0:1:31,9
MALE SPEAKER: It has ketchup
and seasoning.


32
0:1:31,9 --> 0:1:32,73
You guys see the fight

0:1:32,73 --> 0:1:34,538
BRIAN ANDERSON: Temo?


34
0:1:34,538 --> 0:1:37,856

0:1:40,226 --> 0:1:41,18
BRIAN ANDERSON: Yeah, yeah.


38
0:1:41,18 --> 0:1:41,92
TONY MIORANA: When
you are asked to


39
0:1:41,92 --> 0:1:43,53
leave, you have to leave.


40
0:1:43,53 --> 0:1:47,33
And if you don't,
you got to go.


41
0:1:47,33 --> 0:1:51,794



42
0:1:51,794 --> 0:1:54,49
SAM SMYTH: See how he left
the first time, right?


43
0:1:54,49 --> 0:1:55,755
Like all you guys are
fucking douche bags.


44
0:1:55,755 --> 0:1:56,36
You're fucking faggots.


45
0:1:56,36 --> 0:1:58,596
You're all fucking faggot,

MALE SPEAKER: Were you in it?


50
0:2:6,4 --> 0:2:6,694
SEAN MALTO: No.


51
0:2:6,694 --> 0:2:8,509
I was off to the side,
just watching.


52
0:2:8,509 --> 0:2:9,979
MALE SPEAKER: If it got out of
hand-- like if the guy had


53
0:2:9,979 --> 0:2:11,16
gotten through Tony and--


54
0:2:11,16 --> 0:2:12,43
ALEX OLSON: Yeah.


55
0:2:12,43 --> 0:2:15,65
Well then if he'd gotten through
those guys, I'm just


56
0:2:15,65 --> 0:2:20,22
basically a shield for someone
else to throw him at.


57
0:2:20,22 --> 0:2:21,82
MALE SPEAKER: How
are you feeling?


58
0:2:21,82 --> 0:2:23,7

61
0:2:26,64 --> 0:2:29,81



62
0:2:29,81 --> 0:2:31,461

This is some steamy

0:2:38,87 --> 0:2:40,32

I'm hung over yet.


68
0:2:40,32 --> 0:2:41,29
MALE SPEAKER: You're

69
0:2:41,29 --> 0:2:44,75

0:2:47,26 --> 0:2:48,473

0:2:57,12 --> 0:2:58,92
MALE SPEAKER: Mike, why'd you
beat those guys up last night?


77
0:2:58,92 --> 0:3:0,3
MIKE CARROLL: I didn't fucking
touch anyone, dude.


78
0:3:0,3 --> 0:3:3,58
They got touched.

0:3:3,58 --> 0:3:5,31

0:3:36,712 --> 0:3:37,962
Can I sleep?


93
0:3:37,962 --> 0:4:7,77



94
0:4:7,77 --> 0:4:9,21
MALE SPEAKER: Most skaters--


95
0:4:9,21 --> 0:4:10,79
they'll have to warm up.


96
0:4:10,79 --> 0:4:13,56
He's completely opposite--


97
0:4:13,56 --> 0:4:17,54
gets out of the car, does the
craziest or hardest shit, and


98
0:4:17,54 --> 0:4:21,602
then is over it, like done.

0:4:21,602 --> 0:4:22,83
JOHN ALDEN: That was
fucking psycho.


100
0:4:22,83 --> 0:4:26,748
The first one he did, his tail
drug around on the chain link


101
0:4:26,748 --> 0:4:29,954
and was like
duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.


102
0:4:29,954 --> 0:4:31,33
It was so sick.


103
0:4:31,33 --> 0:4:31,75
MALE SPEAKER: That's his shit.


104
0:4:31,75 --> 0:4:34,92
Like he just likes to fucking
jump out and go nuts.


105
0:4:34,92 --> 0:4:37,37
And then he's fucking
chilling for a bit.


106
0:4:37,37 --> 0:4:37,54
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


107
0:4:37,54 --> 0:4:38,72
It's almost like you

0:4:38,72 --> 0:4:41,3
And you don't realize that it
was all just first try.


109
0:4:41,3 --> 0:4:42,58
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,

110
0:4:42,58 --> 0:4:43,4

111
0:4:43,4 --> 0:4:44,81
Pretty much, dude.


112
0:4:44,81 --> 0:4:47,81
He's fucking insane
with it like that.

MALE SPEAKER: I mean, that's
how good he is.


117
0:4:59,62 --> 0:5:4,45
He just can go and do the
hardest line or, like, highest


118
0:5:4,45 --> 0:5:10,175
air, or weirdest area of the
park and then, like, sit down


119
0:5:10,175 --> 0:5:14,86
and drink a beer and be Tony.


120
0:5:14,86 --> 0:5:15,934
ROBBIE RUSSO: Look
at that thing.


121
0:5:15,934 --> 0:5:17,79
That thing is huge.

Because there's a
wee love seat.

0:5:44,443 --> 0:5:44,936

And it blends in, man.


136
0:5:45,922 --> 0:5:46,908

0:5:52,824 --> 0:5:55,289

0:6:51,95 --> 0:6:52,84
And you see these skaters.


167
0:6:52,84 --> 0:6:55,18
And you trip out
how they look.


168
0:6:55,18 --> 0:6:57,72
Because you see them
in magazines.


169
0:6:57,72 --> 0:6:59,98
And then you actually
see them in person.


170
0:6:59,98 --> 0:7:1,67
And they kind of look a little
different than you thought


171
0:7:1,67 --> 0:7:2,73
they would look.


172
0:7:2,73 --> 0:7:3,69
I was all--


173
0:7:3,69 --> 0:7:4,7
I would, like, stare at them.


174
0:7:4,7 --> 0:7:7,97
And like, I don't know.


175
0:7:7,97 --> 0:7:12,242
Like, the dude skates the

176
0:7:12,242 --> 0:7:13,63
one else can skate.


177
0:7:13,63 --> 0:7:16,5
Like a mini ramp to him
is like a fucking


178
0:7:16,5 --> 0:7:20,4
vert ramp for us.


179
0:7:20,4 --> 0:7:20,71

0:7:28,6 --> 0:7:29,75

MALE SPEAKER: Oh,

196
0:7:39,16 --> 0:7:41,6
I've known most of them for,
like, 20 plus years.


197
0:7:41,6 --> 0:7:42,98
And I've never actually
been on a skate


198
0:7:42,98 --> 0:7:43,75
trip with any of them.


199
0:7:43,75 --> 0:7:45,6
So that's nice.

0:7:45,6 --> 0:7:45,86
These guys--


201
0:7:45,86 --> 0:7:48,75
we've all been skating
for so long together.


202
0:7:48,75 --> 0:7:50,24
It's the same world.

0:7:58,17 --> 0:7:59,529
It's coming.


206
0:7:59,529 --> 0:8:2,404
Next one, Pat, next one.


207
0:8:2,404 --> 0:8:3,37
PETER TRUJILLO: I was
taking it short.


208
0:8:3,37 --> 0:8:4,18
MALE SPEAKER: I thought you

209
0:8:4,18 --> 0:8:4,895
PETER TRUJILLO: And then I
took it long that time.


210
0:8:4,895 --> 0:8:6,57
It worked.


211
0:8:6,57 --> 0:8:8,678
Yes.


212
0:8:8,678 --> 0:8:10,61
I sketched on the push in.


213
0:8:10,61 --> 0:8:11,535
PRESTON MAIGETTER: They did.


214
0:8:11,535 --> 0:8:11,83
PETER TRUJILLO: Yeah.


215
0:8:11,83 --> 0:8:13,22
PRESTON MAIGETTER: Saw that
a little bit there.


216
0:8:13,22 --> 0:8:13,72
PETER TRUJILLO: Yeah.


217
0:8:13,72 --> 0:8:14,22
PRESTON MAIGETTER: All right.


218
0:8:14,22 --> 0:8:14,855
We've got to get ready.


219
0:8:14,855 --> 0:8:17,3
Because Petey's going to
get back in there, Pat.


220
0:8:17,3 --> 0:8:18,165
PAT: What's he going to do?


221
0:8:18,165 --> 0:8:19,89
PRESTON MAIGETTER: Yo,
you're going to see.


222
0:8:19,89 --> 0:8:20,714
Because he doesn't tell you.


223
0:8:20,714 --> 0:8:21,779
He just starts trying
something.


224
0:8:21,779 --> 0:8:24,124
And it'll happen.


225
0:8:24,124 --> 0:8:26,47
You've got to be ready
for him to skate.


226
0:8:26,47 --> 0:8:26,57
PAT: What's that?


227
0:8:26,57 --> 0:8:28,36
PRESTON MAIGETTER: I feel like
how you're kind of ill


228
0:8:28,36 --> 0:8:31,57
prepared with the tape and the
battery last three minutes.


229
0:8:31,57 --> 0:8:33,52
Usually you put a fresh
tape in when


230
0:8:33,52 --> 0:8:34,77
Peter Trujillo is skating.


231
0:8:34,77 --> 0:8:44,8



232
0:8:44,8 --> 0:8:50,68
[CHEERING]


233
0:8:50,68 --> 0:8:50,96
PRESTON MAIGETTER:
I told you, Pat.


234
0:8:50,96 --> 0:8:52,88
You got to be ready.


235
0:8:52,88 --> 0:8:54,45
Did you get that?


236
0:8:54,45 --> 0:8:55,65
PAT: Yeah.


237
0:8:55,65 --> 0:8:57,615
PRESTON MAIGETTER: So we don't
need to send you that clip?


238
0:8:57,615 --> 0:9:1,1



239
0:9:1,1 --> 0:9:2,465
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]


240
0:9:2,465 --> 0:9:4,41
How did you first meet Julian?


241
0:9:4,41 --> 0:9:6,77
MALE SPEAKER: We partied at one
and the Anti-Hero team.


242
0:9:6,77 --> 0:9:9,365
MALE SPEAKER: Ah, the Hellride
Crew, I met when I was 21.


243
0:9:9,365 --> 0:9:11,12
We went to Australia together.


244
0:9:11,12 --> 0:9:13,17
Andy Roy invited
me to go along.


245
0:9:13,17 --> 0:9:15,525
MALE SPEAKER: Did you feel like
when you met those guys


246
0:9:15,525 --> 0:9:18,5
that that was something you
wanted to skate for, or that


247
0:9:18,5 --> 0:9:19,43
was a crew you wanted
to roll with?


248
0:9:19,43 --> 0:9:19,745
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


249
0:9:19,745 --> 0:9:22,15
I definitely wanted to travel
with these guys as much as


250
0:9:22,15 --> 0:9:25,29
possible and continue
the saga.


251
0:9:25,29 --> 0:9:27,512
MALE SPEAKER: How'd that come
about, that they asked you to


252
0:9:27,512 --> 0:9:28,46
ride for Anti-Hero?


253
0:9:28,46 --> 0:9:30,5
MALE SPEAKER: We were
in Marseilles.


254
0:9:30,5 --> 0:9:33,29
And I was staying with John
and Julian in their room.


255
0:9:33,29 --> 0:9:35,98
And they were like, we want
to make this happen.


256
0:9:35,98 --> 0:9:38,38
But it's just going
to take some time.


257
0:9:38,38 --> 0:9:43,8
And then a year later from that
point, I was on the team.


258
0:9:43,8 --> 0:9:45,34
MALE SPEAKER: How is the
experience of riding for


259
0:9:45,34 --> 0:9:47,2
Anti-Hero different than
some of these other


260
0:9:47,2 --> 0:9:47,62
companies you rode for?


261
0:9:47,62 --> 0:9:50,7
MALE SPEAKER: Just we travel
good together is the main


262
0:9:50,7 --> 0:9:54,17
thing, just being able to travel
with your friends and


263
0:9:54,17 --> 0:9:55,32
have a good time.


264
0:9:55,32 --> 0:9:57,24
MALE SPEAKER: Have you
been on camping trips


265
0:9:57,24 --> 0:9:58,27
with these dudes before?


266
0:9:58,27 --> 0:9:58,83
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.


267
0:9:58,83 --> 0:9:59,14
Yeah.


268
0:9:59,14 --> 0:10:1,24
That's how we've been doing
it for a while.


269
0:10:1,24 --> 0:10:1,93
It's way better.


270
0:10:1,93 --> 0:10:4,24
Because you get to know
people a lot better.


271
0:10:4,24 --> 0:10:7,58
Because you don't get to the
hotel and you all just


272
0:10:7,58 --> 0:10:10,45
disperse off to your rooms and
get locked away for the night.


273
0:10:10,45 --> 0:10:15,89
You know, you're there at the
campsite, making food together


274
0:10:15,89 --> 0:10:18,97
and just telling stories.


275
0:10:18,97 --> 0:10:20,67
MALE SPEAKER: What kind of
back patch did you have?


276
0:10:20,67 --> 0:10:23,72
MALE SPEAKER: I had a Saxon back
patch back in the day.


277
0:10:23,72 --> 0:10:27,71
And I had an Iron Maiden Piece
of Mine painters cap with on


278
0:10:27,71 --> 0:10:33,33
one flap had Def Leppard
triangular patch


279
0:10:33,33 --> 0:10:34,6
on one of the flaps.


280
0:10:34,6 --> 0:10:35,77
FEMALE SPEAKER: Triangular
mangular.


281
0:10:35,77 --> 0:10:36,82
MALE SPEAKER: Triangular.


282
0:10:36,82 --> 0:10:38,44
MALE SPEAKER: You should have
brought it on this trip.


283
0:10:38,44 --> 0:10:39,78
MALE SPEAKER: I wish I had it.


284
0:10:39,78 --> 0:10:42,84
But I think it got stole.


285
0:10:42,84 --> 0:10:45,512
MALE SPEAKER: Look how Brogini
this outfit is.


286
0:10:45,512 --> 0:10:47,1
FEMALE SPEAKER: He's about to
swallow that wang whole.


287
0:10:47,1 --> 0:10:47,81
FRANK GERWER: Dude, I know.


288
0:10:47,81 --> 0:10:49,42
It's a hooded fucking sleeve.


289
0:10:49,42 --> 0:10:49,77
MALE SPEAKER: It's just
sleeves and--


290
0:10:49,77 --> 0:10:52,29
MALE SPEAKER: Don't even
bite my shit, dude.


291
0:10:52,29 --> 0:10:52,76
MALE SPEAKER: Brogini.


292
0:10:52,76 --> 0:10:53,55
That's our clothing company.


293
0:10:53,55 --> 0:10:56,4
FRANK GERWER: That might
be the first--


294
0:10:56,4 --> 0:10:56,64
Yeah, whenever.


295
0:10:56,64 --> 0:10:59,36
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, anyway,
where's the music at?


296
0:10:59,36 --> 0:11:0,52
Let's dance.


297
0:11:0,52 --> 0:11:2,44
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
trying to do that.


298
0:11:2,44 --> 0:11:5,47
Baby boy, you got hickeys
on your neck.


299
0:11:5,47 --> 0:11:7,9
You are so corrupted.


300
0:11:7,9 --> 0:11:8,57
You got one right there.


301
0:11:8,57 --> 0:11:9,34
And turn around.


302
0:11:9,34 --> 0:11:10,78
Turn around.


303
0:11:10,78 --> 0:11:11,5
You got one right there.


304
0:11:11,5 --> 0:11:12,16
ROBBIE RUSSO: Well.


305
0:11:12,16 --> 0:11:14,348
MALE SPEAKER: Where is it?


306
0:11:14,348 --> 0:11:16,925
How'd you get that?


307
0:11:16,925 --> 0:11:18,21
ROBBIE RUSSO: Twice my age.


308
0:11:18,21 --> 0:11:18,55
Twice my age.


309
0:11:18,55 --> 0:11:20,285
FEMALE SPEAKER: The girl who
gave it to you is getting


310
0:11:20,285 --> 0:11:22,18
fucked in the woods.


311
0:11:22,18 --> 0:11:25,67
She's getting fucked
in the woods.


312
0:11:25,67 --> 0:11:27,85
MALE SPEAKER: By what wood?


313
0:11:27,85 --> 0:11:30,3
FEMALE SPEAKER: By a
little bit of wood.


314
0:11:30,3 --> 0:11:31,13
MALE SPEAKER: She's getting
fucked in the


315
0:11:31,13 --> 0:11:33,39

317
0:11:34,465 --> 0:11:34,97
MALE SPEAKER: Who's got wood?


318
0:11:34,97 --> 0:11:36,4

0:11:36,4 --> 0:11:37,65

320
0:11:37,65 --> 0:13:37,65
