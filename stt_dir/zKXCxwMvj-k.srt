CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: It`s Wednesday, I`m
Carl Azuz. This is CNN STUDENT NEWS. Just


2
0:0:16,9 --> 0:0:21,6
a few minutes, we`re going to explain how
musician can make money off of viral video.


3
0:0:21,6 --> 0:0:25,949
First of all, we are taking a look inside
President Obama`s cabinet. These are the president`s


4
0:0:25,949 --> 0:0:30,48
top advisers who run different parts of the
U.S government. Getting into the cabinet is


5
0:0:30,48 --> 0:0:36,2
a two step process. Step one, the president
has to nominate you, step 2, the U.S. Senate


6
0:0:36,2 --> 0:0:39,85
has to confirm you. The Founding Fathers gave
the Senate that power in the Constitution.


7
0:0:39,85 --> 0:0:45,7
It`s called advice and consent. Chuck Hagel
has been on both sides of this process. He


8
0:0:45,7 --> 0:0:49,62
served two terms in the Senate, now he`s President
Obama`s pick to be the new U.S. Secretary


9
0:0:49,62 --> 0:0:54,87
of Defense. Yesterday, he was approved by
the Senate for that job. The vote was originally


10
0:0:54,87 --> 0:0:59,39
set for a couple of weeks ago, but there were
some controversy around Hagel because of some


11
0:0:59,39 --> 0:1:4,6
of the things he`s said in the past. His confirmation
vote was delayed by a filibuster. It`s a legislative


12
0:1:4,6 --> 0:1:9,12
tactic that`s used to block and delay action,
and if you`ve studied up on this, it happens


13
0:1:9,12 --> 0:1:13,22
only in the Senate. The U.S. House of Representatives
doesn`t have a filibuster.


14
0:1:13,22 --> 0:1:17,76
And this is how it works: the Senate allows
for unlimited debate. In order to filibuster


15
0:1:17,76 --> 0:1:22,66
something, a bill, a vote, whatever -- once
the Senator is given the floor, he or she


16
0:1:22,66 --> 0:1:27,55
just keeps it. You don`t even have to talk
about the issue that`s being delayed. Originally


17
0:1:27,55 --> 0:1:32,93
senators had to actually talk when they wanted
to filibuster. The record for that belongs


18
0:1:32,93 --> 0:1:39,98
to former South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond.
In 1957, he went for more than 24 hours. Now,


19
0:1:39,98 --> 0:1:45,39
you don`t need to speak continuously in order
to filibuster. What you need if you want to


20
0:1:45,39 --> 0:1:51,27
end one, is 60 votes. It takes three fifths
of the Senate. To end that debate and the


21
0:1:51,27 --> 0:1:56,17
filibuster. Yesterday, the vote to end the
debate on Chuck Hagel`s confirmation was 71


22
0:1:56,17 --> 0:2:0,57
to 27. That`s stopped the filibuster, and
opened the door for the vote on Hagel to be


23
0:2:0,57 --> 0:2:2,86
the new U.S. Secretary of Defense.


24
0:2:2,86 --> 0:2:5,56

25
0:2:5,56 --> 0:2:10,67
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What`s the word: it`s
an adjective that describes natural or raw


26
0:2:10,67 --> 0:2:14,93
oil before it goes to the refining process.
Crude. That`s the word.


27
0:2:14,93 --> 0:2:21,43
(END VIDEO CLIP)


28
0:2:21,43 --> 0:2:29,96
AZUZ: When gas prices make you want to scream,
try not to deafen the guy in the convenience


29
0:2:29,96 --> 0:2:34,98
store. It`s not usually his fault. Store mark
up barely adds to the price of gas. If you


30
0:2:34,98 --> 0:2:39,97
really want to blame someone, you could blame
OPEC. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting


31
0:2:39,97 --> 0:2:45,34
Countries, a group of 12 nations, has a significant
influence on the cost of crude oil.


32
0:2:45,34 --> 0:2:51,25
For every dollar you spend on gas, crude takes
the biggest chunk -- about 72 cents. The second


33
0:2:51,25 --> 0:2:55,709
largest factor in the price -- taxes. The
U.S. federal government has a tax on every


34
0:2:55,709 --> 0:3:0,44
gallon bought. So do state and local governments
whose taxes depend on where you live. They


35
0:3:0,44 --> 0:3:6,1
all add up to approximately 13 cents on every
gas dollar. Unfortunately for drivers, we


36
0:3:6,1 --> 0:3:9,959
can`t just take oil from the ground, filter
out the dirt and stick it into our gas tanks.


37
0:3:9,959 --> 0:3:15,72
We`ve got to pay for the cost of refining,
the process of turning crude into actual gasoline.


38
0:3:15,72 --> 0:3:19,959
That covers about eight cents on our rapidly
shrinking dollar. And then, actually getting


39
0:3:19,959 --> 0:3:24,74
gasoline to stations and maybe throwing in
an advertisement here and there makes up seven


40
0:3:24,74 --> 0:3:30,2
cents on the buck. Now, all that adds up to
a dollar, 100 percent of the cost of gas.


41
0:3:30,2 --> 0:3:35,55
So you can see how an actual filling station
has practically no influence on the price.


42
0:3:35,55 --> 0:3:40,44
It does get a cent or two, but if you go inside
and buy a drink and a donut, that helps keep


43
0:3:40,44 --> 0:3:43,16
their business fueled.


44
0:3:43,16 --> 0:3:46,93
Thanks to the Oscar nominated movie "Lincoln"
there has been some talk lately about the


45
0:3:46,93 --> 0:3:49,22
13th Amendment, which abolished slavery.

DANIEL DAY-LEWIS, ACTOR: Settles the fate
for all coming time, not only of the millions


48
0:3:56,34 --> 0:4:1,569
now in bondage, but of unborn millions to
come.

(END VIDEO CLIP)


50
0:4:2,37 --> 0:4:6,76
AZUZ: The movie sent one man on a hunt for
Mississippi`s role in the 13th Amendment.


51
0:4:6,76 --> 0:4:12,51
The amendment was ratified in 1865, but Mississippi
didn`t officially sign on until this year.


52
0:4:12,51 --> 0:4:18,94
Except Mississippi lawmakers did ratify the
13th in 1995. The Mississippi`s Secretary


53
0:4:18,94 --> 0:4:21,699
of State`s office never sent the paperwork
to Washington.

KEN SULLIVAN, UNIV. OF MISSISSIPPI MEDICAL
CENTER: I don`t think there was any dark plot


56
0:4:26,12 --> 0:4:30,5
or any -- any kind of a plan to not get this
done. I think it was just an error, and I`m


57
0:4:30,5 --> 0:4:31,93
just glad that it`s corrected.


58
0:4:31,93 --> 0:4:35,36
AZUZ: 18 years later, Mississippi`s vote is
officially on the books.


59
0:4:35,36 --> 0:4:37,919
RANJAN BATRA, RESEARCHER, UNIV. OF MISSISSIPPI
MEDICAL CENTER: What I`ve done or Ken has


60
0:4:37,919 --> 0:4:43,37
done is really just dotting an "i" or crossing
a "t". But I think -- I think it`s an important


61
0:4:43,37 --> 0:4:45,32
"I` to dot and in important "t" to cross.

0:4:45,32 --> 0:4:46,4

63
0:4:46,4 --> 0:4:49,5
AZUZ: Over in Europe, scientists are testing
food samples. They are looking for traces


64
0:4:49,5 --> 0:4:54,82
of horse meat and products that were labeled
as beef. Officials are conducting investigations


65
0:4:54,82 --> 0:4:58,66
about this, companies are pulling products
off the shelves. Some consumers are buying


66
0:4:58,66 --> 0:5:3,37
and eating less meat. A lot of people have
been affected by this scandal, but farmers


67
0:5:3,37 --> 0:5:4,639
may turn out to benefit.


68
0:5:4,639 --> 0:5:5,28
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


69
0:5:5,28 --> 0:5:10,2
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:
The family`s focus -- quality food close to


70
0:5:10,2 --> 0:5:14,71
the customer. Husband Mike helps butcher the
beef when it comes back from the abattoir.


71
0:5:14,71 --> 0:5:18,59
MICHAEL BELCHER, FARMER: The supply chain
is so small and we know everything about the


72
0:5:18,59 --> 0:5:21,37
animal, and there`s nothing that we don`t
know about it.


73
0:5:21,37 --> 0:5:26,77
ROBERTSON: They`ve been farming here for four
generations. Nothing frustrates them more


74
0:5:26,77 --> 0:5:28,84
than the horse meat scandal.


75
0:5:28,84 --> 0:5:35,5
They blame big food chains driving down costs
to maximize profit. Supermarket greed that


76
0:5:35,5 --> 0:5:38,6
led them to take their own meat to market.


77
0:5:38,6 --> 0:5:44,43
BELCHER: I can survive on what Mr. Supermarket
charges the consumer. I can`t survive on what


78
0:5:44,43 --> 0:5:46,52
he wants to pay me as the producers.


79
0:5:46,52 --> 0:5:51,35
ROBERTSON: And this is where the family meat
ends up, on the table in the farmer`s market,


80
0:5:51,35 --> 0:5:56,77
100 mile south in London. One of several farmer`s
markets they sell their product to, and over


81
0:5:56,77 --> 0:6:2,199
the past few weeks, they tell us that business
is up.


82
0:6:2,199 --> 0:6:6,419
Customers like the direct access to the meat
produced at Marshhouse (ph) farm.


83
0:6:6,419 --> 0:6:11,49
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I find the quality of the
meat is very much better, and I know where


84
0:6:11,49 --> 0:6:16,9
it comes from. And I know that it has been
raised humanely.


85
0:6:16,9 --> 0:6:21,52
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would avoid processed,
packaged stuff that`s, you know, all we see


86
0:6:21,52 --> 0:6:26,33
now at the moment. You don`t know what`s -- you
don`t what`s in it. This here, you`ve talked


87
0:6:26,33 --> 0:6:31,71
to the farmers directly, they -- they prepare,
they bring it in, and you can see exactly


88
0:6:31,71 --> 0:6:34,1
what it is and they can tell you exactly what
it is. You can trust them.


89
0:6:34,1 --> 0:6:38,509
ROBERTSON: It seems that people don`t want
the processed meat that`s in the supermarkets.


90
0:6:38,509 --> 0:6:45,259
For Mike and his family and the customers
that come here, this can only mean peace of


91
0:6:45,259 --> 0:6:47,7
mind. Nic Robertson, CNN, London.

(END VIDEOTAPE)


93
0:6:47,8 --> 0:6:53,4
AZUZ: All right, we`ve got another story for
you about unexpected financial upside. It


94
0:6:53,4 --> 0:6:57,62
starts with the "Harlem Shake." Yes, the viral
videos -- no we are not making one. Now, if


95
0:6:57,62 --> 0:7:1,99
you`ve seen you`re probably more focused on
the dancing than the music. But someone did


96
0:7:1,99 --> 0:7:6,27
write the song, it`s his intellectual property,
and every time someone clicks on the Harlem


97
0:7:6,27 --> 0:7:8,729
shake video, he`s getting paid.


98
0:7:8,729 --> 0:7:10,33
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


99
0:7:10,33 --> 0:7:11,13
(MUSIC)


100
0:7:11,13 --> 0:7:17,0
AZUZ: The students at Colorado college broke
every library code in the book with their


101
0:7:17,0 --> 0:7:23,639
version. "The Harlem Shake" even has this
year`s Daytona 500 winner Jimmy Johnson dancing,


102
0:7:23,639 --> 0:7:29,33
and employees at San Antonio Sea World. Now,
Baauer, the song`s creator, is poised to hit


103
0:7:29,33 --> 0:7:34,24
it big. He gets a piece of the ad revenue
-- every time someone clicks on a Harlem Shake


104
0:7:34,24 --> 0:7:34,32
video.


105
0:7:34,32 --> 0:7:35,83
BILL WERDE, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, BILLBOARD
MAGAZINE: This could be a meaning for revenue


106
0:7:35,83 --> 0:7:39,49
stream -- if you figure a couple of dollars
per 1,000 streams -- and you multiply that


107
0:7:39,49 --> 0:7:41,71
by millions -- you start to see that this
is real money.


108
0:7:41,71 --> 0:7:48,9
AZUZ: Real money is right. As of last week
100,000 "Harlem Shake" videos have been viewed,


109
0:7:48,9 --> 0:7:53,35
some 400 million times on Youtube. And that`s
boosting record sales. "The Harlem Shake"


110
0:7:53,35 --> 0:7:58,77
was the top song download on iTunes U.S. last
week, and one of the top downloads on iTunes


111
0:7:58,77 --> 0:8:3,2
Europe. Baauer isn`t the only artist riding
the viral video wave.


112
0:8:3,2 --> 0:8:3,93

113
0:8:3,93 --> 0:8:9,41
AZUZ: South Korean artist Psy hit pay dirt
last year with Youtube phenomenon "Gangham


114
0:8:9,41 --> 0:8:11,539
Style" with more than a billion hits.


115
0:8:11,539 --> 0:8:17,569
WERDE: "Billboard" has reported that Psy made
upwards of $2 million just from the streams


116
0:8:17,569 --> 0:8:19,93
of "Gangham Style", that was without selling
a single track.


117
0:8:19,93 --> 0:8:24,509
AZUZ: But corporate America sees a financial
opportunity in the viral video market. Pepsi


118
0:8:24,509 --> 0:8:27,88
is now promoting soda with its very own "Harlem
Shake."

0:8:27,88 --> 0:8:28,53

120
0:8:28,53 --> 0:8:33,329
AZUZ: I asked about the "Harlem Shake" on
Twitter yesterday. Most people were tweeting


121
0:8:33,329 --> 0:8:39,789
they love it. Tell us what you think. If you`re
on Facebook, find us at Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? In nature,
penguins are found only in the Southern Hemisphere

0:8:49,779 --> 0:8:59,18
(END VIDEO CLIP)


127
0:8:59,18 --> 0:9:5,5
AZUZ: The penguins` bodies are designed to
move through the water. But getting them in


128
0:9:5,5 --> 0:9:10,66
the water -- that can be tricky. At least
for this one. Walking down the board, he`s


129
0:9:10,66 --> 0:9:17,19
fine. Going off the board -- ah-ah. He takes
another (pass coming up and chickens out again.


130
0:9:17,19 --> 0:9:22,29
This is some serious penguin trepidation.
The bird is flightless, but he is frightful.


131
0:9:22,29 --> 0:9:27,66
One more chance, probably just going to turn
around again, but this time, a little too


132
0:9:27,66 --> 0:9:32,42
close to the edge. It wasn`t exactly a swan
dive, but sometimes when you need to get over


133
0:9:32,42 --> 0:9:37,35
your fear, you just got to wing it. Really,
there was no pengoing (ph) off the board,


134
0:9:37,35 --> 0:9:40,88
he just had to get the courage to dive in
with both feet, bird brain.
