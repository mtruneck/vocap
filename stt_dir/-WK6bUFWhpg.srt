1
0:0:1,1 --> 0:0:2,5
PROFESSOR: ALL RIGHT, WELL, IT'S GREAT TO
SEE THIS MANY OF YOU


2
0:0:2,5 --> 0:0:5,29
HERE THIS MORNING. I DIDN'T ACTUALLY EXPECT
IT WITH THE EXAM


3
0:0:5,29 --> 0:0:11,22
TONIGHT, SO KUDOS TO ALL OF YOU FOR SHOWING
UP TODAY. AND I'VE


4
0:0:11,22 --> 0:0:14,4
HEARD THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE THAT SOME PEOPLE
ARE HAVING


5
0:0:14,4 --> 0:0:19,89
DIFFICULTY LOCATING THE LECTURE NOTES THAT
I'VE BEEN POSTING.


6
0:0:19,89 --> 0:0:23,25
SO BE SURE TO LOOK FOR THOSE ON BSPACE, NOT
ON THE BIO 1B


7
0:0:23,25 --> 0:0:26,9
WEBSITE. YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED E-MAILS
AFTER EACH LECTURE


8
0:0:26,9 --> 0:0:31,7
WITH THE LINK TO THE LECTURE NOTES, BUT IF
YOU DIDN'T, YOU CAN GO


9
0:0:31,7 --> 0:0:36,989
TO THE BSPACE SITE. LOG IN WITH YOUR CAL ID.
GO TO MY ACTIVE


10
0:0:36,989 --> 0:0:41,6
SITES, THE MENU UP, IN THE UPPER LEFT, RIGHT
OF THE MENU. AND


11
0:0:41,6 --> 0:0:47,449
UNDER THERE YOU SHOULD FIND THE LINK WHICH
SAYS BIO 1B LECTURE,


12
0:0:47,449 --> 0:0:54,569
PLANTS, FALL 10. AND THEN CLICK THERE. AND
THAT WILL TAKE YOU


13
0:0:54,569 --> 0:0:59,67
TO A SCREEN WHERE YOU'LL SEE RESOURCES AS
ONE OF THE CHOICES ON


14
0:0:59,67 --> 0:1:3,929
THE LEFT. CLICK RESOURCES AND YOU'LL FIND
THE, THE LECTURE


15
0:1:3,929 --> 0:1:7,65
FOLDER, AND JUST OPEN THAT UP AND ALL THE
LECTURE PRESENTATIONS


16
0:1:7,65 --> 0:1:11,65
ARE IN THERE WITH THE NOTES EMBEDDED IN. SO
PLEASE CHECK THAT


17
0:1:11,65 --> 0:1:15,63
OUT. AND IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE, JUST GIVE ME
AN E-MAIL. OKAY,


18
0:1:15,63 --> 0:1:19,33
ALSO DON'T FORGET ON SUNDAY NIGHT TO CHANGE
THE CLOCK BACK ONE


19
0:1:19,33 --> 0:1:22,58
HOUR OR YOU'LL SHOW UP AN HOUR EARLY FOR LECTURE
WHICH I'M SURE


20
0:1:22,58 --> 0:1:28,95
YOU'D RATHER NOT DO BECAUSE I CERTAINLY WON'T
BE HERE THEN.


21
0:1:28,95 --> 0:1:33,34
OKAY, SO WE'RE GOING TO START OUT TODAY JUST
GOING BACK OVER,


22
0:1:33,34 --> 0:1:38,38
ACTUALLY, CONTINUING THIS SURVEY OF THE ALGAE
AND LOOKING AT THE


23
0:1:38,38 --> 0:1:42,2
LAST MAJOR FORM OF LIFE CYCLE. AND IT'S ACTUALLY
THE ONE WE'LL


24
0:1:42,2 --> 0:1:44,31
BE LOOKING AT FOR THE REST OF THE COURSE,
SO IT'S REALLY


25
0:1:44,31 --> 0:1:44,31



26
0:1:44,31 --> 0:1:49,62
IMPORTANT TO IN PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THIS ONE
WHICH ISN'T COMMON


27
0:1:49,62 --> 0:1:52,21
TO ALL THE ALGAE, JUST SOME OF THEM, BUT IT'S
FOUND IN ALL THE


28
0:1:52,21 --> 0:1:55,81
LAND PLANTS. AND THEN WE'LL GET TO SOME ALGAL
USES. AND THEN


29
0:1:55,81 --> 0:2:0,89
TALK ABOUT THE INVASION OF LAND BY PLANTS
WHICH WILL BE A THEME


30
0:2:0,89 --> 0:2:4,82
INTO THE NEXT LECTURE AS WELL. OKAY, I JUST
WANT TO MAKE ONE


31
0:2:4,82 --> 0:2:8,2
JUMP BACK TO THE FUNGI THOUGH, THIS SLIDE
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER


32
0:2:8,2 --> 0:2:11,579
ABOUT PENICILLIN. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WHAT
I WAS TRYING TO


33
0:2:11,579 --> 0:2:15,45
GET ACROSS HERE BECAUSE IT WAS A BIT UNCLEAR
THE WAY I PRESENTED


34
0:2:15,45 --> 0:2:20,109
IT, THAT PENICILLIN REALLY, THE MAJOR POINT
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE


35
0:2:20,109 --> 0:2:24,76
HERE IS THAT THE, THE CELL WALLS OF BACTERIA
ARE DIFFERENT FROM


36
0:2:24,76 --> 0:2:30,26
THE CELL WALLS OF ALL EUKARYOTES, OKAY. THEY'RE
COMPRISED OF


37
0:2:30,26 --> 0:2:37,239
PEPTIDOGLYCANS, WHICH AS THE NAME IMPLIES
ARE MADE UP OF AN


38
0:2:37,239 --> 0:2:43,48
AMINO, OF AMINO ACIDS AND SUGARS. AND PENICILLIN
ACTS TO


39
0:2:43,48 --> 0:2:46,489
INTERFERE WITH THE ENZYMES THE BACTERIA NEED
TO SYNTHESIZE THE


40
0:2:46,489 --> 0:2:50,459
PEPTIDOGLYCANS. AND WITHOUT THEIR CELL WALLS,
THE BACTERIA WILL


41
0:2:50,459 --> 0:2:54,129
BURST. AND SO IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE AS A MEDICINE
BECAUSE OF


42
0:2:54,129 --> 0:2:57,129
COURSE WE LACK CELL WALLS. AND FUNGI CAN GET
AWAY WITH


43
0:2:57,129 --> 0:3:0,15
PRODUCING IT BECAUSE THEIR CELL WALLS OF COURSE
ARE MADE OF


44
0:3:0,15 --> 0:3:6,499
CHITIN WHICH IS, I MENTIONED THAT A FEW TIME
EARLIER, THE SAME


45
0:3:6,499 --> 0:3:11,54
CARBOHYDRATE THAT ARTHROPOD EXOSKELETONS ARE
MADE OF, OR


46
0:3:11,54 --> 0:3:15,99
ORGANISMS LIKE CRUSTACEANS AND INSECTS. SO
I JUST WANT TO ADD


47
0:3:15,99 --> 0:3:18,599
THAT EXTRA CONTEXT HERE AND HOPE THAT IS A
LITTLE CLEARER NOW.


48
0:3:18,599 --> 0:3:24,23
ALL RIGHT, SO AS FAR AS THE ALGAE GO, I JUST
WANT TO RECAP THE


49
0:3:24,23 --> 0:3:29,689
MAIN POINTS SO FAR BEFORE WE LAUNCH BACK IN,
OOPS, OOPS, YEAH,


50
0:3:29,689 --> 0:3:34,649
THAT'S RIGHT. SO REMEMBER THAT THE CYANOBACTERIA,
THE


51
0:3:34,649 --> 0:3:34,65



52
0:3:34,65 --> 0:3:39,95
BLUE/GREEN BACTERIA, THESE SHARE THE ABILITY
TO PHOTOSYNTHESIZE,


53
0:3:39,95 --> 0:3:44,959
TO USE LIGHT TO CAPTURE ATMOSPHERIC CARBON,
FIX IT AS SUGAR.


54
0:3:44,959 --> 0:3:48,669
AND THEY'RE THE ONLY ORGANISMS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY
EVOLVED


55
0:3:48,669 --> 0:3:52,739
PHOTOSYNTHESIS. I SHOULDN'T SAY THE ONLY ONES,
BUT THE ONES THAT


56
0:3:52,739 --> 0:3:57,769
EVOLVE PHOTOSYNTHESIS THAT ALL THE ALGAE HAVE
SUBSEQUENTLY TAKEN


57
0:3:57,769 --> 0:4:1,62
ADVANTAGE OF. SO THE EVOLUTION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS
BY


58
0:4:1,62 --> 0:4:6,4
CYANOBACTERIA REPRESENTS THE SOLE EVOLUTIONARY
EVENT THAT


59
0:4:6,4 --> 0:4:9,749
RESULTED IN PHOTOSYNTHESIS. AND THEN ALL THE
OTHER ALGAL


60
0:4:9,749 --> 0:4:13,609
LINEAGES BASICALLY JUST CAPTURED CYANOBACTERIA
EITHER DIRECTLY OR


61
0:4:13,609 --> 0:4:19,88
INDIRECTLY AND HAVE UTILIZED THEIR EVOLUTIONARY
INNOVATION THAT


62
0:4:19,88 --> 0:4:26,26
WAY. AND ONLY ONE MAJOR LINEAGE OF THE CYANOBACTERIA
GAVE RISE


63
0:4:26,26 --> 0:4:31,6
TO ALL OF THE PLASTIDS, THE CHLOROPLASTS,
AND OTHER PLASTIDS IN


64
0:4:31,6 --> 0:4:36,99
THE EUKARYOTIC ALGAE. OKAY, SO THAT --


65
0:4:36,99 --> 0:4:43,16
STUDENT: IS THE CYANOBACTERIA THE FIRST [INAUDIBLE]


66
0:4:43,16 --> 0:4:45,3
PROFESSOR: AS FAR AS I KNOW, YEAH. THAT'S,
THAT'S ALL, I'M


67
0:4:45,3 --> 0:4:48,6
ONLY FAMILIAR WITH, WITH CYANOBACTERIA. I
MEAN ONE OF THE


68
0:4:48,6 --> 0:4:53,25
THINGS WE'RE GOING TO SEE, THERE'S QUITE A
FEW SINGLE EVENTS IN,


69
0:4:53,25 --> 0:4:56,92
I MEAN IF WE LOOK BACK TO THE LAND PLANTS,
THEY ALL SEEM TO STEM


70
0:4:56,92 --> 0:5:0,88
FROM ONE ANCESTOR. PHYTOSYNTHESIS SEEMS TO
STEM BACK TO ONE


71
0:5:0,88 --> 0:5:3,22
LINEAGE. BUT IT'S HARD TO SAY, YOU KNOW, IF
THERE WERE


72
0:5:3,22 --> 0:5:7,2
EVOLUTION-, IF THERE WERE OTHER TRIAL BALLOONS
OUT THERE THAT


73
0:5:7,2 --> 0:5:12,13
JUST DIDN'T SUCCEED AND THEY WERE OUT COMPETED.
IT'S DIFFICULT.


74
0:5:12,13 --> 0:5:14,65
I MEAN THERE MAY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ONE ORIGIN
OF LIFE ON EARTH.


75
0:5:14,65 --> 0:5:19,57
AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL THERE'S JUST ONE LINEAGE
OF LIFE AND ALL


76
0:5:19,57 --> 0:5:22,75
LIVING ORGANISMS DESCEND FROM THAT COMMON
ANCESTOR. BUT THERE


77
0:5:22,75 --> 0:5:22,75



78
0:5:22,75 --> 0:5:25,95
COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW,
LIVING OR


79
0:5:25,95 --> 0:5:28,5
SEMI-LIVING, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM,
TYPES OF THINGS OUT


80
0:5:28,5 --> 0:5:32,58
THERE THAT COULDN'T COMPETE WITH THE ORGANISM
THAT GAVE RISE TO


81
0:5:32,58 --> 0:5:32,91
LIFE.


82
0:5:32,91 --> 0:5:37,1
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]


83
0:5:37,1 --> 0:5:41,92
PROFESSOR: WELL, THAT ALL THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC
EUKARYOTES HAVE


84
0:5:41,92 --> 0:5:47,9
CAPTURED THE CYANOBACTER-, RESULT FROM AN
EVENT, THIS


85
0:5:47,9 --> 0:5:53,94
ENDOSYMBIOTIC EVENT WHERE CYANOBACTERIA WERE
CAPTURED. AND THIS


86
0:5:53,94 --> 0:5:57,93
BASICALLY, THIS TREE ENCOMPASSES ALL OF THE
MAIN LINEAGES OF


87
0:5:57,93 --> 0:6:5,28
EUKARYOTIC ORGANISMS THAT DESCEND FROM THAT
EVENT. AND THAT


88
0:6:5,28 --> 0:6:9,53
INCLUDES ALL OF THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS.
THE GREEN ALGAE,


89
0:6:9,53 --> 0:6:14,19
AS I'LL POINT OUT LATER, ULTIMATELY GAVE RISE
TO LAND PLANTS.


90
0:6:14,19 --> 0:6:17,3
SO THIS IS, THIS IS PRETTY MUCH IT. SO IT
REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE


91
0:6:17,3 --> 0:6:21,77
ONE EVENT THAT GAVE RISE TO, TO ALL THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC
ORGANISMS


92
0:6:21,77 --> 0:6:26,24
THAT WE CALL ALGAE OR LAND PLANTS. SO AGAIN,
WE HAVE THIS MAJOR


93
0:6:26,24 --> 0:6:32,93
DIVERGENCE BETWEEN THIS FIRST MAJOR SPLIT
BETWEEN EUKARYOTIC


94
0:6:32,93 --> 0:6:36,7
PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS, RED ALGAE ON THE
ONE HAND AND GREEN


95
0:6:36,7 --> 0:6:39,26
ALGAE ON THE OTHER. AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE
GROUPS IN A


96
0:6:39,26 --> 0:6:43,34
LITTLE MORE DETAIL IN A MOMENT. BUT I WANT
TO, I WAS STARTING


97
0:6:43,34 --> 0:6:47,12
OUT FIRST TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE OTHER
LINEAGES THAT


98
0:6:47,12 --> 0:6:50,81
ORIGINATED FROM A SECONDARY ENDOSYMBIOSIS
OR ACQUIRED THEIR


99
0:6:50,81 --> 0:6:54,74
PLASTIDS, THEIR CHLOROPLASTS BY SECONDARY
ENDOSYMBIOSIS WHERE


100
0:6:54,74 --> 0:7:0,49
THEY ENGULFED A EUKARYOTIC PHOTOSYNTHETIC
ORGANISM, EITHER A


101
0:7:0,49 --> 0:7:5,99
GREEN ALGA OR RED ALGA. AND THIS LEAD TO A
NUMBER OF LINEAGES.


102
0:7:5,99 --> 0:7:8,36
I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS ONE BECAUSE
IT'S PRETTY


103
0:7:8,36 --> 0:7:8,36



104
0:7:8,36 --> 0:7:14,4
MINOR. BUT I DID MENTION THERE'S A MAJOR LINEAGE
HERE. THE


105
0:7:14,4 --> 0:7:20,96
EUGLENIDS WHICH CAPTURED THEIR CHLOROPLAST
BY CAPTURING A


106
0:7:20,96 --> 0:7:26,93
UNICELLULAR GREEN EUKARYOTIC ALGAE. AND THEY
HAVE A FLAGELLUM


107
0:7:26,93 --> 0:7:30,14
WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO MOVE AROUND QUICKLY LIKE
YOU CAN SEE HERE.


108
0:7:30,14 --> 0:7:33,15
IT'S VERY DISTINCTIVE. IT HAS SOME CRYSTALLINE
INCLUSION IN IT


109
0:7:33,15 --> 0:7:37,55
THAT YOU CAN DO A SECTION OF IT. IT'S VERY
DISTINCTIVE. THEIR


110
0:7:37,55 --> 0:7:40,43
PLASTID IS VERY MUCH LIKE A GREEN ALGA, SO
THAT THAT IN ADDITION


111
0:7:40,43 --> 0:7:44,74
TO THE MOLECULAR DATA MAKE IT REALLY CLEAR.
BUT MOST OF THEM


112
0:7:44,74 --> 0:7:48,2
ACTUALLY CAN STILL CAPTURE PREY. THEY CAN
STILL ENGULF PREY.


113
0:7:48,2 --> 0:7:52,59
AND SO IT'S, EVEN THE, YOU CAN SEE THAT THE
POTENTIAL FOR A


114
0:7:52,59 --> 0:7:57,9
SECONDARY ENDOSYMBIOSIS, YOU KNOW, TO ACTUALLY
STILL ENGULF AN


115
0:7:57,9 --> 0:8:0,53
ORGANISM THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BECOME A SYMBIONT
IS EVEN STILL


116
0:8:0,53 --> 0:8:4,3
PRESENT IN THESE ORGANISMS, EVEN THE ONES
THAT ARE PHOTOSYNTHETIC


117
0:8:4,3 --> 0:8:11,61
IN PART IN MANY CASES. OKAY. AND THEN THE
OTHER MAIN LINEAGE,


118
0:8:11,61 --> 0:8:14,7
THE ONES, THE SECONDARY ENDOSYMBIONTS THAT
CAPTURE RED ALGAE


119
0:8:14,7 --> 0:8:17,36
INCLUDE THESE ONES. AND I MENTIONED LAST TIME
THE


120
0:8:17,36 --> 0:8:21,86
DINOFLAGELLATES, WHICH LIKE THE EUGLENIDS
ARE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF


121
0:8:21,86 --> 0:8:26,639
PHYTOPLANKTON. AND REMEMBER PHYTOPLANKTON
JUST MEANS BASICALLY


122
0:8:26,639 --> 0:8:29,99
PLANKTON WHICH ARE FREE-FLOATING ORGANISMS
IN AQUATIC SITUATIONS,


123
0:8:29,99 --> 0:8:35,38
UNICELLULAR ONES TYPICALLY. PHYTO MEANS PLANT,
SO PHOTOSYNTHETIC


124
0:8:35,38 --> 0:8:40,56
BASICALLY. SO DINOFLAGELLATES DESCEND FROM
A COMMON ANCESTOR


125
0:8:40,56 --> 0:8:45,38
WITH THESE OTHER GROUPS THAT HAD A RED ALGA
INCORPORATED INTO


126
0:8:45,38 --> 0:8:48,76
THEIR CELLS. AND A GOOD NUMBER OF THE DINOFLAGELLATES
ARE STILL


127
0:8:48,76 --> 0:8:52,25
PHOTOSYNTHETIC. SOME OF THEM HAVE LOST THE
ABILITY TO


128
0:8:52,25 --> 0:8:56,5
PHOTOSYNTHESIZE AND STRICTLY ARE HETEROTROPHIC
AND ARE ACTUALLY


129
0:8:56,5 --> 0:8:56,5



130
0:8:56,5 --> 0:9:1,31
PRETTY GOOD PREDATORS IN SOME CASES. BUT I
SHOWED YOU SOME


131
0:9:1,31 --> 0:9:8,8
PHOTOS, OOPS, OF THESE LAST TIME. AND THEY
HAVE THIS EXTERNAL


132
0:9:8,8 --> 0:9:12,83
ARMOR, THESE PLATES OF CELLULOSE. AND CELLULOSE
AGAIN IS THE


133
0:9:12,83 --> 0:9:15,4
SAME CARBOHYDRATE THAT -- WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN
TO THIS YET -- BUT IN


134
0:9:15,4 --> 0:9:19,39
PLANTS THE CELL WALLS, THE LAND PLANTS HAVE
CELL WALLS OF


135
0:9:19,39 --> 0:9:22,34
CELLULOSE AS WELL, BUT THIS APPEARS TO BE
AN INDEPENDENT ORIGIN


136
0:9:22,34 --> 0:9:26,75
OF THAT. ANYWAYS, THESE HAVE SOME INTERESTING
ECOLOGY,


137
0:9:26,75 --> 0:9:30,21
ESPECIALLY IN OCEANIC SITUATIONS THAT I MENTIONED
LAST TIME WITH


138
0:9:30,21 --> 0:9:38,55
THE RED TIDES AND TOXINS, BIOLUMINESCENCE.
THE OTHER REALLY


139
0:9:38,55 --> 0:9:44,46
MAJOR GROUP OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS THAT
DESCENDED FROM THIS


140
0:9:44,46 --> 0:9:47,73
SECONDARY ENDOSYMBIOSIS INVOLVING A RED ALGA
ARE WHAT'S CALLED


141
0:9:47,73 --> 0:9:53,0
THE STRAMENOPILES. AND THAT NAME'S NOT SO
IMPORTANT, BUT IT'S


142
0:9:53,0 --> 0:9:56,98
BASICALLY A GROUP THAT INCLUDES A HUGE DIVERSITY
OF DIFFERENT


143
0:9:56,98 --> 0:10:1,26
GROUPS OF ORGANISMS AND SEVERAL THAT ARE PHOTOSYNTHETIC
THAT


144
0:10:1,26 --> 0:10:4,5
WE'VE LONG RECOGNIZED AS DISTINCT GROUPS.
BUT NOW IT'S CLEAR


145
0:10:4,5 --> 0:10:10,42
THAT THEY'RE ALL VERY CLOSELY RELATED. WOOPS.
AND ONE OF


146
0:10:10,42 --> 0:10:16,14
THESE IS THE DIATOMS, WHICH I JUST GOT, I
WAS JUST GETTING TO AT


147
0:10:16,14 --> 0:10:19,44
THE END OF LAST LECTURE. AND THIS IS ONE OF
THE MOST DIVERSE


148
0:10:19,44 --> 0:10:23,16
GROUPS OF ALGAE. THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED
THOUSAND SPECIES


149
0:10:23,16 --> 0:10:26,76
DESCRIBED. AND REMEMBER THAT'S ROUGHLY THE
SAME DIVERSITY THAT


150
0:10:26,76 --> 0:10:31,7
WE SEE ACROSS ALL OF THE FUNGAL PHYLA, SO
THAT'S A HUGE NUMBER OF


151
0:10:31,7 --> 0:10:35,33
TAXA. YOU KNOW IT'S, IT'S ROUGHLY A THIRD
OF WHAT WE'VE


152
0:10:35,33 --> 0:10:39,18
RECOGNIZED AMONG THE FLOWERING PLANTS. SO
IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF


153
0:10:39,18 --> 0:10:43,11
DIVERSITY. AND YOU CAN SEE, GET SOME SENSE
OF THIS DIVERSITY.


154
0:10:43,11 --> 0:10:45,67
IT'S REALLY CLEAR MORPHOLOGICALLY THAT YOU'RE
DEALING WITH LOTS


155
0:10:45,67 --> 0:10:45,71



156
0:10:45,71 --> 0:10:49,779
OF DIFFERENT GROUPS OF ORGANISMS HERE. AND
ONE OF THE REASONS


157
0:10:49,779 --> 0:10:51,99
THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM DESCRIBED, WELL,
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF


158
0:10:51,99 --> 0:10:55,52
REASONS. WELL, FOR ONE THING, THEY'RE INCREDIBLY
ABUNDANT. YOU


159
0:10:55,52 --> 0:10:58,5
FIND THEM IN HUGE NUMBERS. IF YOU JUST TAKE
A SCOOP OF SEA WATER


160
0:10:58,5 --> 0:11:1,92
OR LAKE WATER IN DIFFERENT AQUATIC SETTINGS
OR MARINE SETTINGS,


161
0:11:1,92 --> 0:11:5,96
YOU CAN FIND LARGE NUMBERS OF DIATOMS TYPICALLY
AND A LOT OF


162
0:11:5,96 --> 0:11:11,46
DIVERSITY. BUT THEY ALSO ARE MORPHOLOGICALLY
DIFFERENTIATED


163
0:11:11,46 --> 0:11:15,12
OFTENTIMES BY THEIR CELL WALLS, WHICH YOU
CAN SEE ARE REALLY


164
0:11:15,12 --> 0:11:19,29
EXTENSIVELY ORNAMENTED. AND THERE ARE MANY
DIFFERENT SHAPES AND


165
0:11:19,29 --> 0:11:23,21
SIZES OF THESE THINGS IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT
TAXA. AND THESE


166
0:11:23,21 --> 0:11:26,29
CELL WALLS ARE REALLY AMAZING BECAUSE THEY'RE
ACTUALLY LARGELY


167
0:11:26,29 --> 0:11:31,88
MADE UP OF, OF HYDRATED SILICA LIKE GLASS,
AND THEY PRESERVE


168
0:11:31,88 --> 0:11:35,4
REALLY WELL THEN IN THE FOSSIL RECORD. THEY'RE
INERT. AND WE


169
0:11:35,4 --> 0:11:39,93
HAVE AN EXCELLENT FOSSIL RECORD OF DIATOMS
THAT GOES WAY BACK.


170
0:11:39,93 --> 0:11:44,89
AND PALEOBOTANISTS THAT WORK IN THIS GROUP
HAVE LOTS OF STORIES


171
0:11:44,89 --> 0:11:46,77
TO TELL FROM THE FOSSIL RECORD, USUALLY REALLY
RICH AND PRETTY


172
0:11:46,77 --> 0:11:52,87
COMPLETE RECORDS. THERE'S ALSO EXTENSIVE DEPOSITS
OF


173
0:11:52,87 --> 0:11:56,41
DIATOMACEOUS EARTH IT'S CALLED THAT'S REALLY
VALUABLE. IT'S


174
0:11:56,41 --> 0:11:59,68
MINED EXTENSIVELY WHERE YOU FIND THESE DEPOSITS
OF DIATOM


175
0:11:59,68 --> 0:12:7,149
SKELETONS AND USED FOR FILTRATE AND A WIDE
VARIETY OF PURPOSES.


176
0:12:7,149 --> 0:12:11,46
BUT THERE'S ONE REALLY HUGE DEPOSIT DOWN IN
SANTA BARBARA COUNTY


177
0:12:11,46 --> 0:12:14,12
NEAR LOMPOC. IF YOU EVER DOWN IN THAT AREA,
THEY'VE BEEN MINING


178
0:12:14,12 --> 0:12:19,49
THAT FOR MANY DECADES. AND ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT THINGS


179
0:12:19,49 --> 0:12:25,63
ABOUT DIATOMS IS THAT THEY MAY ACCOUNT FOR
UP TO 25 PERCENT OF


180
0:12:25,63 --> 0:12:29,309
THE PHOTOSYNTHESIS, THE PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY
THAT'S GOING ON ON


181
0:12:29,309 --> 0:12:29,31



182
0:12:29,31 --> 0:12:34,589
EARTH. SO THEY'RE PUMPING OUT A HUGE AMOUNT
OF OXYGEN. THEY'RE


183
0:12:34,589 --> 0:12:40,2
CAPTURING A LOT OF CO2. AND THEY'RE CONSIDERED
TO BE ONE OF THE


184
0:12:40,2 --> 0:12:45,51
CRUCIAL ORGANISMS FOR MAINTAINING ATMOSPHERIC
CO2 AT A REASONABLE


185
0:12:45,51 --> 0:12:49,16
LEVEL. SO THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS TO ACTUALLY
TRY TO INCREASE


186
0:12:49,16 --> 0:12:53,279
THE NUMBER OF DIATOMS IN THE OCEAN BY DUMPING
LARGE AMOUNTS OF


187
0:12:53,279 --> 0:12:59,23
IRON INTO THE OCEAN. BUT SO FAR THAT HASN'T
HAPPENED BECAUSE


188
0:12:59,23 --> 0:13:3,14
THESE MAJOR TYPES OF ECOSYSTEM INTERVENTIONS
LIKE THAT SOMETIMES


189
0:13:3,14 --> 0:13:6,66
HAVE UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES, AND IT'S NOT
QUITE CLEAR WHAT THAT


190
0:13:6,66 --> 0:13:10,74
MIGHT END UP RESULTING IN. YOU KNOW, THE NEGATIVE
IMPACTS MIGHT


191
0:13:10,74 --> 0:13:14,86
OUTWEIGH THE POSITIVE ONES. BUT ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT DIATOMS


192
0:13:14,86 --> 0:13:20,56
DO THAT'S IMPORTANT IN ADDITION TO FIXING
CO2 IS THAT WHEN THEY


193
0:13:20,56 --> 0:13:24,58
DIE, THEY TEND TO SINK. AND SO THEY ACTUALLY
END UP ON THE


194
0:13:24,58 --> 0:13:28,96
OCEAN FLOOR. AND BY DOING THAT, THEY TAKE
THAT CARBON OUT OF


195
0:13:28,96 --> 0:13:32,43
THE ECOSYSTEM ESSENTIALLY. AND SO THAT CARBON'S
NOT


196
0:13:32,43 --> 0:13:37,43
RECIRCULATING BACK INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. AND
SO THEY CAN REALLY


197
0:13:37,43 --> 0:13:40,93
STORE A LOT OF, THEY CAN TAKE CARBON OUT OF
THE SYSTEM WHICH


198
0:13:40,93 --> 0:13:45,5
WOULD BE A REALLY VALUABLE THING RIGHT NOW.
OKAY, AND ONE OF


199
0:13:45,5 --> 0:13:48,91
THE STRANGEST THINGS ABOUT THESE GUYS IS THAT
THESE ARE


200
0:13:48,91 --> 0:13:52,27
UNICELLULAR TYPICALLY. SOMETIMES THEY'LL BE
IN FILAMENTS, BUT


201
0:13:52,27 --> 0:13:56,31
THEY'RE SEPARATE CELLS, SEPARATE ORGANISMS.
AND AS YOU CAN MAYBE


202
0:13:56,31 --> 0:14:1,87
MAKE OUT HERE, NOT VERY WELL, THEY ARE, THEIR
CELL WALL IS


203
0:14:1,87 --> 0:14:6,25
BASICALLY LIKE TWO HALVES OF A PETRI DISH
WITH ONE-HALF INSIDE


204
0:14:6,25 --> 0:14:10,76
THE OTHER ONE. AND SO WHEN THEY ACTUALLY GO
TO REPRODUCE, IT'S


205
0:14:10,76 --> 0:14:16,14
PRETTY BIZARRE. BUT, I SHOULD MENTION FIRST
OF ALL THAT THEY


206
0:14:16,14 --> 0:14:19,86
ACTUALLY HAVE AN ANIMAL-LIKE LIFE CYCLE IN
TERMS OF THE, THE TYPE


207
0:14:19,86 --> 0:14:19,86



208
0:14:19,86 --> 0:14:23,58
OF, WELL, THAT THE FACT THAT THERE'S ONLY,
THE ONLY HAPLOID STAGE


209
0:14:23,58 --> 0:14:28,5
IS THE GAMETES, SO THEY'RE JUST LIKE US THAT
WAY. THE MATURE


210
0:14:28,5 --> 0:14:36,48
DIATOM IS DIPLOID. AND THEY HAVE, BASICALLY
FERTILIZATION


211
0:14:36,48 --> 0:14:41,0
HAPPENS RIGHT AFTER MEIOSIS LIKE IT DOES WITH
US. THOUGH THAT'S


212
0:14:41,0 --> 0:14:46,56
AN INTERESTING DIFFERENCE FROM OTHER GROUPS.
THEY ALSO


213
0:14:46,56 --> 0:14:49,64
REPRODUCE BY SEMI-CONSERVATIVE REPLICATION
IN A SENSE. IT'S


214
0:14:49,64 --> 0:14:52,88
ALMOST LIKE DNA REPLICATION IN THE SENSE THAT
THEY'RE, EACH HALF


215
0:14:52,88 --> 0:14:57,57
OF THEIR SHELL, THEY MOSTLY ASEXUALLY REPRODUCE
WITHOUT SEX,


216
0:14:57,57 --> 0:15:1,69
MOSTLY. BUT WHEN THEY ASEXUALLY REPRODUCE,
THE TWO HALVES OF THE


217
0:15:1,69 --> 0:15:6,4
SHELL SEPARATE AND A NEW HALF FOR EACH ONE
OF THOSE HALVES IS


218
0:15:6,4 --> 0:15:10,529
CREATED INSIDE THE OLD ONE. SO IF YOU'RE CREATING
NEW SHELLS


219
0:15:10,529 --> 0:15:14,82
INSIDE THE OLD HALF ALL THE TIME, AT LEAST
SOME OF THE LINEAGES


220
0:15:14,82 --> 0:15:20,8
ARE GOING TO GET TO BE PROGRESSIVELY SMALLER
THROUGH TIME. AND


221
0:15:20,8 --> 0:15:22,79
THAT DECREASE IN SIZE OF COURSE IS GOING TO
REACH A CRITICAL


222
0:15:22,79 --> 0:15:28,5
THRESHOLD AT SOME POINT. AND ROUGHLY AROUND
THAT TIME, THESE


223
0:15:28,5 --> 0:15:32,37
LINEAGES ARE STIMULATED TO START PRODUCING
GAMETES. AND THEY


224
0:15:32,37 --> 0:15:37,22
UNDERGO SEXUAL REPRODUCTION WHEN THEY GET
TOO SMALL. AND THEY


225
0:15:37,22 --> 0:15:40,6
RELEASE THEIR GAMETES. THE TWO HALVES OF THE
SHELL SEPARATE,


226
0:15:40,6 --> 0:15:43,48
RELEASE THE GAMETES WHICH HAVE BEEN PRODUCED
OF COURSE BY MEIOSIS


227
0:15:43,48 --> 0:15:48,62
BECAUSE THEY'RE DIPLOID ADULT ORGANISMS. THE
GAMETES GET


228
0:15:48,62 --> 0:15:51,81
TOGETHER WITH THOSE OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS,
MAKE A ZYGOTE, AND THEN


229
0:15:51,81 --> 0:15:57,43
THAT DEVELOPS INTO A NEW DIPLOID FULLY-SIZED
DIATOM. SO THAT'S


230
0:15:57,43 --> 0:16:3,37
ONE OF THE REALLY INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT
DIATOM REPRODUCTION.


231
0:16:3,37 --> 0:16:5,22
OKAY, SO ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT DIATOMS?
YEAH?


232
0:16:5,22 --> 0:16:9,76
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]



233
0:16:9,76 --> 0:16:14,48
PROFESSOR: WELL, DIATOMACEOUS EARTH IS USED
INDUSTRIALLY FOR


234
0:16:14,48 --> 0:16:19,64
LOTS OF DIFFERENT PURPOSES. IT'S AN ABRASIVE.
IT CAN BE USED


235
0:16:19,64 --> 0:16:23,98
AS AN ABRASIVE. I MEAN IT IS, YOU KNOW, SILICA
IS INVOLVED.


236
0:16:23,98 --> 0:16:30,16
AND IT'S ALSO, WELL, THERE'S, YEAH, IT GOES
ON AND ON. BUT IT,


237
0:16:30,16 --> 0:16:34,92
IT'S USED AS A FILTRATE. THE DIATOMS HAVE,
YOU KNOW THEY'RE SO


238
0:16:34,92 --> 0:16:39,86
TINY, AND THERE'S SOME POROSITY TO THEIR SKELETONS,
I MEAN TO


239
0:16:39,86 --> 0:16:44,37
THEIR CELL WALLS. SO IT'S, YEAH, THERE'S A
WIDE RANGE OF USES.


240
0:16:44,37 --> 0:16:47,709
BUT, YEAH, IT'S HARVESTED ON A MASS SCALE.
I MEAN IT'S MINED ON


241
0:16:47,709 --> 0:16:55,589
A LARGE SCALE FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIAL
USES. OKAY,


242
0:16:55,589 --> 0:16:59,56
SO THE DIATOMS ARE JUST ONE GROUP OF STRAMENOPILES,
THAT ONE


243
0:16:59,56 --> 0:17:3,16
CLADE I MENTIONED THAT HAS QUITE A FEW PHOTOSYNTHETIC
ORGANISMS


244
0:17:3,16 --> 0:17:6,66
IN IT. ANOTHER ONE OF THE GOLDEN ALGAE, AND
THESE ARE ALSO


245
0:17:6,66 --> 0:17:10,549
UNICELLULAR OR COLONIAL, BUT THEY'RE MOSTLY
IN FRESHWATER.


246
0:17:10,549 --> 0:17:15,39
DIATOMS ARE EITHER FRESH OR SEA WATER. BUT
THEY'RE CALLED GOLDEN


247
0:17:15,39 --> 0:17:18,699
I JUST WANT TO MENTION BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS
GOLDEN APPEARANCE


248
0:17:18,699 --> 0:17:23,26
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THESE, THESE ACCESSORY PIGMENTS
IN THEIR


249
0:17:23,26 --> 0:17:27,42
PLASTIDS IN ADDITION TO CHLOROPHYL THAT ARE
USEFUL FOR CAPTURING


250
0:17:27,42 --> 0:17:32,49
LIGHT AT WAVE LENGTHS THAT PENETRATE WATER
WELL. AND THAT'S


251
0:17:32,49 --> 0:17:36,38
SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO SEE IN THEIR CLOSE
RELATIVES THE BROWN


252
0:17:36,38 --> 0:17:40,1
ALGAE WHICH ARE MOSTLY MARINE. ALMOST ALL
OF THEM ARE FOUND IN


253
0:17:40,1 --> 0:17:45,74
THE OCEAN. AND THEY ALSO HAVE THIS YELLOWISH
OR BROWNISH COLOR


254
0:17:45,74 --> 0:17:49,0
FROM THESE ACCESSORY PIGMENTS. WELL, IT USED
TO BE THOUGHT THAT


255
0:17:49,0 --> 0:17:53,8
THESE ARE PRETTY CLOSELY RELATED TO LAND PLANTS
BECAUSE THEY HAVE


256
0:17:53,8 --> 0:17:56,809
PRETTY SIMILAR MORPHOLOGY AND SOME OF THEM
HAVE SIMILAR LIFE


257
0:17:56,809 --> 0:18:0,21
CYCLES. BUT NOW WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE ACTUALLY
A COMPLETELY


258
0:18:0,21 --> 0:18:0,21



259
0:18:0,21 --> 0:18:4,21
DISTINCT LINEAGE OF EUKARYOTES THAT HAVE CAPTURED
PLASTIDS. YOU


260
0:18:4,21 --> 0:18:9,24
KNOW, THEY DESCEND FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR
WITH THE DIATOMS, THE


261
0:18:9,24 --> 0:18:12,95
GOLDENS. AND EVEN THE DINOFLAGELLATES THAT
CAPTURED A RED ALGA,


262
0:18:12,95 --> 0:18:16,4
HAVE AN ANCESTOR THAT CAPTURED A RED ALGA,
THEY DON'T DESCEND


263
0:18:16,4 --> 0:18:20,67
FROM THE GREEN ALGAL LINEAGE. AND THIS INCLUDES
SOME OF OUR


264
0:18:20,67 --> 0:18:27,57
REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND LARGE KELPS. WE FIND
THESE WORLDWIDE, BUT


265
0:18:27,57 --> 0:18:32,71
OFF OUR COAST WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR
MEMBERS THAT


266
0:18:32,71 --> 0:18:36,51
BOTH IN THE INTERTIDAL REGION UP IN THE WAVES,
THE WAVE-CRASHING


267
0:18:36,51 --> 0:18:41,98
ZONE AS WELL AS OUT IN DEEP WATER. SO UP IN
THE INTERTIDAL ZONE,


268
0:18:41,98 --> 0:18:46,38
IF YOU'VE BEEN OUT ALONG OUR COAST, THIS NORTH
COAST IN SOME OF


269
0:18:46,38 --> 0:18:49,69
THE ROUGHEST AREAS OF THE INTERTIDAL ZONE
WHERE THE WAVES ARE


270
0:18:49,69 --> 0:18:53,179
CONSTANTLY BREAKING AGAINST ROCKS, YOU MIGHT
HAVE SEEN THESE


271
0:18:53,179 --> 0:18:57,15
THINGS. THEY LOOK LIKE LITTLE PALM TREES OUT
THERE. THIS IS THE


272
0:18:57,15 --> 0:19:1,559
SEA PALM IT'S CALLED, POSTELSIA PALMAEFORMIS,
WHICH IS ACTUALLY


273
0:19:1,559 --> 0:19:5,97
EDIBLE. I'VE EATEN THIS. IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
BUT IT'S ONLY


274
0:19:5,97 --> 0:19:10,48
HARVESTED ON A LOW, ON A MINOR SCALE. BUT
IT DEMONSTRATES FIRST


275
0:19:10,48 --> 0:19:14,179
THAT SOME OF THE FEATURES OF KELPS THAT LOOK
VERY MUCH LIKE THAT


276
0:19:14,179 --> 0:19:17,19
ARE LAND PLANTS. FIRST OF ALL LOOK AT THIS
THING. IT LOOKS


277
0:19:17,19 --> 0:19:24,24
VERY TREE-LIKE. IT HAS BLADES UP HERE THAT
ARE HIGHLY PACKED


278
0:19:24,24 --> 0:19:28,79
WITH PLASTIDS WHERE WE GET A LOT THE PHOTOSYNTHESIS
OCCURRING.


279
0:19:28,79 --> 0:19:31,97
THEY LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE LEAVES OF THE FLOWERING
PLANT. THAT'S


280
0:19:31,97 --> 0:19:35,59
CONVERGENT EVOLUTION, AND THERE'S NO CLOSE
RELATIONSHIP. THEY


281
0:19:35,59 --> 0:19:40,1
ALSO HAVE A STEM-LIKE STIPE OR STOCK HERE
THAT LOOKS VERY


282
0:19:40,1 --> 0:19:43,5
STEM-LIKE BUT THAT'S COMPLETELY CONVERGENT
AS WELL. AND THEY


283
0:19:43,5 --> 0:19:47,24
HAVE A HOLDFAST THAT AFFIXES THEM TO THE SUBSTRATE,
AND THAT'S


284
0:19:47,24 --> 0:19:47,24



285
0:19:47,24 --> 0:19:50,99
ALSO, THEY LOOK ROOT-LIKE, BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT THAT IS. IT'S


286
0:19:50,99 --> 0:19:55,429
AN, IT'S BASICALLY AN ATTACHMENT STRUCTURE
RATHER THAN A


287
0:19:55,429 --> 0:20:0,49
CONDUCTING STRUCTURE. AND THESE THINGS CAN
WITHSTAND WAVES


288
0:20:0,49 --> 0:20:3,94
CRASHING AGAINST THEM THAT WOULD TEAR ANY,
ANY OTHER UPRIGHT


289
0:20:3,94 --> 0:20:8,39
ORGANISM APART. AND VARIOUS BIOMECHANICISTS
THAT HAVE BEEN


290
0:20:8,39 --> 0:20:12,169
INTERESTED IN THE, THE WAY THAT ORGANISMS
CAN SURVIVE IN THIS


291
0:20:12,169 --> 0:20:14,85
ZONE WHERE YOU HAVE THE WAVES CRASHING AGAINST
THEM CONSTANTLY


292
0:20:14,85 --> 0:20:19,15
CAN'T REALLY EASILY ACCOUNT FOR THESE GUYS
BECAUSE THEY BREAK ALL


293
0:20:19,15 --> 0:20:24,15
THE RULES. AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND
THESE, THESE


294
0:20:24,15 --> 0:20:27,549
IMPACTS. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT
IN THIS REGARD


295
0:20:27,549 --> 0:20:33,29
IS THAT THEIR CELL WALLS ARE BATHED IN THIS
GEL-LIKE


296
0:20:33,29 --> 0:20:37,25
POLYSACCHARIDES, THIS KIND OF MUCILAGINOUS
POLYSACCHARIDE WHICH


297
0:20:37,25 --> 0:20:41,6
IS FOUND ACROSS THE BROWN ALGAE. AND ALSO
WE'LL SHOW LATER IN


298
0:20:41,6 --> 0:20:46,1
THE RED ALGAE AS WELL THOUGH IT'S DIFFERENT
BIOCHEMICALLY THERE.


299
0:20:46,1 --> 0:20:50,37
BUT THESE MUCILAGINOUS POLYSACCHARIDES GIVE
THIS THING A LOT OF


300
0:20:50,37 --> 0:20:56,21
FLEXIBILITY AND STRENGTH. AND IT'S ONE OF
THE MORE INTERESTING


301
0:20:56,21 --> 0:21:0,11
INTERTIDAL ORGANISMS. BUT OUT AT THE OTHER
END OF THE SPECTRUM


302
0:21:0,11 --> 0:21:4,61
WE GET THESE KELPS GROWING IN WATER UP TO
200 FEET DEEP, SO IN


303
0:21:4,61 --> 0:21:9,25
REALLY DEEP WATER. HERE YOU CAN SEE ONE OF
OUR COASTAL FORESTS


304
0:21:9,25 --> 0:21:13,89
OF KELP. AND THESE ARE KEYSTONE ORGANISMS
ECOLOGICALLY. THEY


305
0:21:13,89 --> 0:21:18,22
PROVIDE BASICALLY A FOREST-LIKE ENVIRONMENT
OUT IN THE OCEAN THAT


306
0:21:18,22 --> 0:21:23,72
PROVIDES COVER, YOU KNOW NURSERY GROUND, A
FEEDING AREA FOR A


307
0:21:23,72 --> 0:21:27,179
WIDE VARIETY OF VERTEBRATES AND INVERTEBRATES.
SO THESE KELP


308
0:21:27,179 --> 0:21:32,75
FOREST WE HAVE OFF OUR COAST ARE, YOU KNOW,
BASICALLY ARE


309
0:21:32,75 --> 0:21:36,759
FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THIS UNUSUAL ECOSYSTEM
WE HAVE HERE ALONG


310
0:21:36,759 --> 0:21:36,76



311
0:21:36,76 --> 0:21:41,11
OUR PACIFIC COAST. AND A LOT OF THESE BIG
KELPS THAT ARE OUT IN


312
0:21:41,11 --> 0:21:47,65
DEEP WATER, THEY HAVE FLOATS NEAR THEIR BLADES
THAT SERVE TO BUOY


313
0:21:47,65 --> 0:21:51,12
THEIR LEAVES OR THEIR BLADES UP IN THE UPPER
WATER LAYERS WHERE


314
0:21:51,12 --> 0:21:55,3
THEY'RE MORE IN CLOSER PROXIMITY TO OR THEY
HAVE MORE


315
0:21:55,3 --> 0:21:58,3
AVAILABILITY TO LIGHT. SO THEY HAVE A NUMBER
OF INTERESTING


316
0:21:58,3 --> 0:22:2,61
ADAPTATIONS THAT, FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
KINDS OF


317
0:22:2,61 --> 0:22:5,96
ENVIRONMENTS. AND THEY'RE A REALLY DIVERSE
GROUP BOTH ON OUR


318
0:22:5,96 --> 0:22:13,75
COAST AND ELSEWHERE. OKAY, SO THOSE ARE THE
BROWN ALGAE. FOR


319
0:22:13,75 --> 0:22:18,34
THE RED ALGAE YOU MIGHT, YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR
WITH THESE TOO.


320
0:22:18,34 --> 0:22:22,16
THEY OFTEN WASH UP ON THE BEACH JUST LIKE
THE BROWNS. AND WE


321
0:22:22,16 --> 0:22:26,9
CAN FIND THEM FROM THE INTERTIDAL ZONE DOWN
INTO MUCH DEEPER


322
0:22:26,9 --> 0:22:29,47
WATER THAN WHERE WE FIND THE BROWN ALGAE.
THESE GUYS CAN GET


323
0:22:29,47 --> 0:22:32,99
INTO WATER THAT'S ALMOST A THOUSAND FEET DEEP,
I MEAN WHERE LIGHT


324
0:22:32,99 --> 0:22:37,559
CAN BARELY PENETRATE. SO THAT'S, THESE ARE
REALLY EXTRAORDINARY


325
0:22:37,559 --> 0:22:41,48
IN TERMS OF THEIR ECOLOGICAL RANGE IN THE
OCEAN. AND WE FIND


326
0:22:41,48 --> 0:22:45,66
THE MOST DIVERSITY OF THESE ONES IN THE, IN
THE TROPICAL OCEANS,


327
0:22:45,66 --> 0:22:49,14
BUT THEY'RE ALSO WELL-REPRESENTED ALONG OUR
COAST, AND WE HAVE A


328
0:22:49,14 --> 0:22:52,84
LOT OF DIVERSITY. THEY HAVE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX
LIFE CYCLES.


329
0:22:52,84 --> 0:22:56,0
AND I WON'T, WE WON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO TRY
TO TEACH YOU THE LIFE


330
0:22:56,0 --> 0:22:59,71
CYCLES OF RED ALGAE BECAUSE THEY HAVE VARIOUS
STAGES. IT'S,


331
0:22:59,71 --> 0:23:2,79
THEY'RE REAL BRAIN TEASERS AS FAR AS TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT


332
0:23:2,79 --> 0:23:6,87
ALL WORKS. BUT THERE'S BIZARRE THINGS THAT
HAPPEN. THERE'S


333
0:23:6,87 --> 0:23:11,76
SOME RED ALGAE THAT ACTUALLY WILL PARASITIZE
OTHER RED ALGAE.


334
0:23:11,76 --> 0:23:17,4
THEY HAVE STRANGE ECOLOGY. BUT AS YOU GET
INTO DEEPER WATER, UP


335
0:23:17,4 --> 0:23:22,32
IN THE SHALLOW WATER, THEY TEND TO BE MORE
GREENISH IN


336
0:23:22,32 --> 0:23:22,32



337
0:23:22,32 --> 0:23:25,44
COLORATION, LIKE THE NORI THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY
FAMILIAR WITH FROM


338
0:23:25,44 --> 0:23:31,83
SUSHI, PORPHYRA WHICH IS HARVESTED FROM SHALLOW
WATER AND IS USED


339
0:23:31,83 --> 0:23:35,35
TO WRAP SUSHI IN JAPANESE CUISINE. AS YOU
GET OUT INTO DEEPER


340
0:23:35,35 --> 0:23:40,89
WATER, THEY TEND TO BE MORE REDDISH. AND THAT'S,
THERE'S A GOOD


341
0:23:40,89 --> 0:23:45,97
REASON FOR THAT REDDISHNESS AND THAT IS THAT
WHEN YOU GET OUT


342
0:23:45,97 --> 0:23:49,84
INTO DEEP WATER, HERE YOU CAN SEE THE DEGREE
TO WHICH LIGHT


343
0:23:49,84 --> 0:23:54,37
PENETRATES IN THE OCEAN AND BREAKING IT OUT
BY THE DIFFERENT


344
0:23:54,37 --> 0:24:0,74
COLORS OF LIGHT. AND WHEN YOU GET DOWN BELOW
ABOUT 125 METERS


345
0:24:0,74 --> 0:24:3,559
IN DEPTH, YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH JUST CAP-, YOU'RE
JUST GETTING THE


346
0:24:3,559 --> 0:24:7,98
PENETRATION OF BLUE AND GREEN LIGHT DOWN HERE.
AND SO THIS IS,


347
0:24:7,98 --> 0:24:11,169
THESE ARE THE WAVE LENGTHS THAT THESE ORGANISMS
CAN UTILIZE WHEN


348
0:24:11,169 --> 0:24:17,4
THEY'RE IN THE DEEPER WATER. AND SO THEY TEND
TO, THEY HAVE


349
0:24:17,4 --> 0:24:21,94
ACCESSORY PIGMENTS THAT APPEAR RED BECAUSE
THEY'RE REFLECTING RED


350
0:24:21,94 --> 0:24:24,41
LIGHT. THEY'RE NOT ABSORBING RED LIGHT, THEY'RE
REFLECTING


351
0:24:24,41 --> 0:24:29,44
IT. THEY'RE ABSORBING BLUES AND GREENS. AND
THESE ARE


352
0:24:29,44 --> 0:24:31,44
PHYCOERYTHRINS. THE NAME'S NOT IMPORTANT,
BUT THERE ARE


353
0:24:31,44 --> 0:24:35,299
ACCESSORY PIGMENTS IN THE PLASTIDS ALONG WITH
THE CHLOROPHYL AND


354
0:24:35,299 --> 0:24:41,78
THEY'RE MASKING THE CHLOROPHYL COLOR. CHLOROPHYL
ALSO HAS A HIGH


355
0:24:41,78 --> 0:24:46,23
ABSORPTION IN THE BLUE END OF THE SPECTRUM
HERE, BUT ALSO IN THE


356
0:24:46,23 --> 0:24:52,919
RED PART OF THE SPECTRUM AS YOU CAN SEE HERE.
THE PHYCOERYTHRINS


357
0:24:52,919 --> 0:24:55,78
ARE, HAVE THEIR ABSORPTION OF LIGHT UP IN
THIS AREA, SO THEY


358
0:24:55,78 --> 0:25:0,289
AUGMENT THAT AND LEAD TO A LOT MORE PHOTOSYNTHESIS
THAN WOULD


359
0:25:0,289 --> 0:25:4,15
OCCUR OTHERWISE AT THOSE DEEPER DEPTHS. SO
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING


360
0:25:4,15 --> 0:25:10,75
ON WITH THE RED ALGAE.


361
0:25:10,75 --> 0:25:13,4
OKAY, SO FINALLY NOW THE GREEN ALGAE.


362
0:25:13,4 --> 0:25:16,13
AND WE'RE GOING TO BASICALLY BE TALKING ABOUT
GREEN ORGANISMS FOR


363
0:25:16,13 --> 0:25:16,13



364
0:25:16,13 --> 0:25:20,35
THE REST OF THE COURSE. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT ANY OF


365
0:25:20,35 --> 0:25:28,1
THE OTHER GROUPS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT? OKAY.
SO THE GREEN


366
0:25:28,1 --> 0:25:35,52
ALGAE HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FORMS
AND ULTRA-STRUCTURAL


367
0:25:35,52 --> 0:25:40,679
MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATION. THERE'S A LOT OF
DIFFERENT ECOLOGI-, A


368
0:25:40,679 --> 0:25:43,28
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LIFE CYCLES AMONG THE
GREEN ALGAE. IT'S A


369
0:25:43,28 --> 0:25:46,63
REALLY DIVERSE GROUP. BUT THESE ALL SEEM TO
STEM FROM THAT


370
0:25:46,63 --> 0:25:51,75
PRIMARY ENDOSYMBIOSIS THAT INVOLVE THE CAPTURING
OF THE


371
0:25:51,75 --> 0:25:54,98
CYANOBACTERIUM. AND THEY DESCEND FROM A COMMON
ANCESTOR WITH


372
0:25:54,98 --> 0:26:0,32
THE RED ALGAE THAT ALSO DIVERGE FROM THAT
COMMON ANCESTOR THAT


373
0:26:0,32 --> 0:26:5,28
HAD ACQUIRED ITS PHOTOSYNTHETIC ABILITY FROM
THAT PRIMARY


374
0:26:5,28 --> 0:26:9,72
ENDOSYMBIOSIS. AND THEY RANGE FROM UNICELLULAR
ORGANISMS LIKE


375
0:26:9,72 --> 0:26:16,9
THE CHLAMYDOMONAS WHICH IS A MODEL ORGANISM
HERE. YOU CAN SEE


376
0:26:16,9 --> 0:26:21,59
THE TWO FLAGELLAE UP AT, AT THE APEX OF ITS
CELLS HERE. THAT'S


377
0:26:21,59 --> 0:26:24,65
AN SEM. IT'S ACTUALLY GREEN. IN THIS IT'S
JUST IN BLACK AND


378
0:26:24,65 --> 0:26:30,97
WHITE. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE COLONIAL GREEN
ALGA, VOLVOX.


379
0:26:30,97 --> 0:26:33,66
THESE VOLVACALEANS ARE REALLY COOL. THEY MOVE
THROUGH THE WATER


380
0:26:33,66 --> 0:26:37,6
AS A BIG SPHERICAL COLONY AND PRODUCE ADDITIONAL
SPHERICAL


381
0:26:37,6 --> 0:26:42,71
DAUGHTER COLONIES INSIDE. THE CELLS CAN LIVE
SEPARATELY, BUT


382
0:26:42,71 --> 0:26:46,3
THEY CAN'T REPRODUCE SEPARATELY, SO THESE
ARE REAL TRUE COLONIAL


383
0:26:46,3 --> 0:26:50,549
ORGANISMS. AND THEN WE HAVE MULTICELLULAR
GREEN ALGAE LIKE THE


384
0:26:50,549 --> 0:26:55,299
SEA LETTUCE HERE, ULVA, ONE OF THE SEAWEEDS.
SO THERE ARE


385
0:26:55,299 --> 0:26:59,25
SEAWEEDS AMONG THE GREEN ALGAE TOO. AND THEY
OCCUR IN BOTH


386
0:26:59,25 --> 0:27:2,2
FRESHWATER, I SHOULD SAY GREEN ALGAE OCCUR
IN BOTH FRESHWATER AND


387
0:27:2,2 --> 0:27:7,13
MARINE SITUATIONS, DIFFERENT TAXA. THEY ALSO
OCCUR IN HIGH


388
0:27:7,13 --> 0:27:10,39
ELEVATION SNOWFIELDS. AND IF YOU'VE BEEN HIKING
UP IN THE HIGH


389
0:27:10,39 --> 0:27:10,39



390
0:27:10,39 --> 0:27:14,97
SIERRA DURING THE SUMMER TIME AND YOU FIND,
YOU SEE SOME


391
0:27:14,97 --> 0:27:20,58
SNOWFIELD THAT LOOKS RED, THAT'S NOT SOME
SORT OF AIR POLLUTION


392
0:27:20,58 --> 0:27:24,25
OR SOMETHING THAT'S CAUSED THAT OR SOME SORT
OF A POLLUTANT, BUT


393
0:27:24,25 --> 0:27:28,789
IT'S ACTUALLY THIS ORGANISM, CHLAMYDOMONAS
NIVALIS, WHICH IS A


394
0:27:28,789 --> 0:27:34,51
CHLAMYDOMONAS LIKE THESE THAT HAS ACCESSORY
RED PIGMENTS AND


395
0:27:34,51 --> 0:27:38,39
WHICH IS WHAT WE CALL CRYOPHILIC. IT LOVES
EXCEEDINGLY COLD


396
0:27:38,39 --> 0:27:42,179
WATER, SO IT LIVES IN THE SNOW MELT FROM THE
SNOW THERE. SO


397
0:27:42,179 --> 0:27:46,33
THERE'S A HUGE ECOLOGICAL RANGE IN THESE THINGS,
ACROSS THE GREEN


398
0:27:46,33 --> 0:27:53,25
ALGAE THAT IS. OKAY, SO BEFORE GOING INTO
THE ORIGIN OF LAND


399
0:27:53,25 --> 0:27:58,37
PLANTS, I JUST WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT
THIS MAJOR TYPE OF LIFE


400
0:27:58,37 --> 0:28:4,98
CYCLE THAT HAS A NICE REPRESENTATIVE IN THESE
GUYS, THE ULVAS,


401
0:28:4,98 --> 0:28:8,39
THE SEA LETTUCES. AND IT'S ALSO THE TYPE OF
LIFE CYCLE WE SEE


402
0:28:8,39 --> 0:28:14,78
IN ALL THE LAND PLANTS, EVERY ONE. BUT IT'S
BEEN INDEPENDENTLY


403
0:28:14,78 --> 0:28:18,49
EVOLVED IN THOSE TWO GROUPS AS I'LL POINT
OUT IN A MINUTE. BUT


404
0:28:18,49 --> 0:28:21,39
ULVA SHOWS THIS TYPE OF LIFE CYCLE WELL, SO
WE'LL TALK ABOUT,


405
0:28:21,39 --> 0:28:27,77
TALK ABOUT IT IN THIS CONTEXT FIRST. SO WE'VE
ALREADY TALKED


406
0:28:27,77 --> 0:28:33,21
ABOUT GAMETIC LIFE CYCLE WHERE THE GAMETE
IS THE ONLY HAPLOID


407
0:28:33,21 --> 0:28:38,59
STAGE, LIKE IN THE CASE OF US AND THE DIATOMS.
AND WE TALKED


408
0:28:38,59 --> 0:28:43,0
ABOUT A ZYGOTIC LIFE CYCLE AS IN THE FUNGI
WHERE THE ZYGOTE IS


409
0:28:43,0 --> 0:28:47,2
THE ONLY DIPLOID PHASE, THE ONLY DIPLOID STAGE.
IN THOSE TWO


410
0:28:47,2 --> 0:28:52,37
CASES MITOSIS IS ONLY OCCURRING IN ONE OF
THE TWO STAGES.


411
0:28:52,37 --> 0:28:55,84
WHEREAS IN AN ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS WE
HAVE MITOSIS


412
0:28:55,84 --> 0:29:2,15
OCCURRING IN BOTH THE HAPLOID STAGE AND THE
DIPLOID STAGE. AND


413
0:29:2,15 --> 0:29:7,87
THAT RESULTS IN SEPARATE MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS
THAT ARE HAPLOID


414
0:29:7,87 --> 0:29:12,8
AND THAT ARE DIPLOID IN THE SAME SPECIES.
AND THESE DIFFERENT


415
0:29:12,8 --> 0:29:12,14



416
0:29:12,14 --> 0:29:17,25
MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS, HAPLOID AND DIPLOID,
ARE ALTERNATING


417
0:29:17,25 --> 0:29:21,73
GENERATION AFTER GENERATION. THIS IS KIND
OF A BIZARRE CONCEPT


418
0:29:21,73 --> 0:29:24,72
THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT
KINDS OF ORGANISMS IN


419
0:29:24,72 --> 0:29:28,809
THE SAME SPECIES THAT DIFFER IN THEIR PLOIDY
AND THEIR CHROMOSOME


420
0:29:28,809 --> 0:29:36,429
NUMBER. AND ONE OF THEM, THE GAMETOPHYTE WHICH
IS THE HAPLOID


421
0:29:36,429 --> 0:29:43,429
ORGANISM -- PHYTE LITERALLY MEANS PLANT --
 GAMETOPHYTE REFERS TO


422
0:29:43,429 --> 0:29:48,44
THE GAMETE PRODUCING PLANT, OKAY, AND SINCE
THIS IS A HAPLOID


423
0:29:48,44 --> 0:29:52,179
ORGANISM, GAMETOPHYTES ARE ALWAYS HAPLOID,
THAT MEANS THEY'RE


424
0:29:52,179 --> 0:29:55,419
GOING TO BE PRODUCING THEIR GAMETES BY MITOSIS,
NOT MEIOSIS LIKE


425
0:29:55,419 --> 0:29:59,75
IN US. SO WE PRODUCE OUR GAMETES BY MEIOSIS.
REMEMBER GAMETES


426
0:29:59,75 --> 0:30:3,48
ARE HAPLOID. WE'RE DIPLOID. WE HAVE TO PRODUCE
OUR GAMETES BY


427
0:30:3,48 --> 0:30:8,88
MEIOSIS WHICH RESULTS IN A REDUCTION IN THE
CHROMOSOME CONT-, YOU


428
0:30:8,88 --> 0:30:10,95
KNOW, IN HALVING OF THE GENOME CONTENT. BUT
GAMETOPHYTES ARE


429
0:30:10,95 --> 0:30:15,73
ALREADY HAPLOID. THEY, THEY GERMINATE DIRECTLY
FROM SPORES,


430
0:30:15,73 --> 0:30:21,559
HAPLOID SPORES. AND SO MITOSIS PRODUCE, PRODUCES
GAMETES THAT


431
0:30:21,559 --> 0:30:27,72
ARE GENETICALLY IDENTICAL TO THE PARENT GAMETOPHYTE.
THOSE


432
0:30:27,72 --> 0:30:32,59
GAMETES FUSE OF COURSE LIKE ANY FERTILIZATION
EVENT. AND THEN


433
0:30:32,59 --> 0:30:35,679
WE HAVE A ZYGOTE, NOT SHOWN HERE, BUT THERE'D
BE A ZYGOTE, OF


434
0:30:35,679 --> 0:30:40,179
COURSE. AND THEN THAT WOULD UNDERGO MITOSES
TO GIVE RISE TO


435
0:30:40,179 --> 0:30:43,53
WHAT'S CALLED THE SPOROPHYTE, WHICH MEANS
LITERALLY THE


436
0:30:43,53 --> 0:30:47,309
SPORE-PRODUCING PLANT, AND IT'S DIPLOID. SPOROPHYTES
ARE ALWAYS


437
0:30:47,309 --> 0:30:53,37
DIPLOID. THEY ALWAYS PRODUCE SPORES, NOT GAMETES.
EVEN THOUGH


438
0:30:53,37 --> 0:30:56,38
THEY'RE DIPLOID, THEY DON'T PRODUCE GAMETES.
THEY PRODUCE SPORES


439
0:30:56,38 --> 0:31:0,73
BY MEIOSIS. BUT THE IMPORTANT THING TO NOT
TO GET CONFUSED ABOUT


440
0:31:0,73 --> 0:31:4,429
HERE, YOU KNOW, WE THINK OF OURSELVES AS DIPLOID
ORGANISMS


441
0:31:4,429 --> 0:31:4,429



442
0:31:4,429 --> 0:31:7,77
UNDERGOING MEIOSIS TO PRODUCE GAMETES. THAT'S
NOT WHAT HAPPENS


443
0:31:7,77 --> 0:31:12,13
IN LAND PLANTS OR IN SOME OF THE GREEN ALGAE.
MEIOSIS GIVES RISE


444
0:31:12,13 --> 0:31:16,34
TO SPORES. AND REMEMBER SPORES, UNLIKE GAMETES,
THEY DON'T FUSE


445
0:31:16,34 --> 0:31:19,6
TOGETHER WITH ONE ANOTHER. THEY JUST GERMINATE
TO PRODUCE A NEW


446
0:31:19,6 --> 0:31:24,33
ORGANISM, WHICH OF COURSE WOULD BE HAPLOID
AFTER MEIOSIS. SO


447
0:31:24,33 --> 0:31:28,5
THAT'S THE LIFE CYCLE. WE HAVE THIS MULTICELLULAR
ORGANISM


448
0:31:28,5 --> 0:31:32,59
THAT'S HAPLOID AS WELL AS THE MULTICELLULAR
ORGANISM THAT'S


449
0:31:32,59 --> 0:31:39,2
DIPLOID. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT?
OKAY, LET'S LOOK


450
0:31:39,2 --> 0:31:44,24
AT AN EXAMPLE NOW WITH ULVA. OH, SORRY.


451
0:31:44,24 --> 0:31:47,789
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].


452
0:31:47,789 --> 0:31:51,539
PROFESSOR: EXACTLY. IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME
AS FERTILIZATION. I


453
0:31:51,539 --> 0:31:55,0
DIDN'T ACTUALLY MAKE THIS SLIDE. IT'S FROM
YOUR BOOK, BUT IF I


454
0:31:55,0 --> 0:31:57,34
HAD WRITTEN IT, I WOULD HAVE WRITTEN FERTILIZATION
THERE BECAUSE


455
0:31:57,34 --> 0:32:1,6
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT TERM. BUT SYNGAMY JUST
MEANS FUSION OF


456
0:32:1,6 --> 0:32:7,29
GAMETES. "SYN" JUST MEANS FUSION OR FUSE.
AND "GAMY" IS,


457
0:32:7,29 --> 0:32:11,669
REFERS TO GAMETES. THEY'RE IDENTICAL, THEY'RE
SYNONYMOUS TERMS.


458
0:32:11,669 --> 0:32:15,23
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].


459
0:32:15,23 --> 0:32:19,96
PROFESSOR: WELL, YEAH, GOOD POINT. THIS, THIS
LIFE CYCLE IN


460
0:32:19,96 --> 0:32:23,99
ITS ESSENCE RIGHT HERE, THIS PARTICULAR SLIDE
IS REALLY AN


461
0:32:23,99 --> 0:32:26,96
IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE THIS REALLY BOILS IT
DOWN TO ITS, TO THE


462
0:32:26,96 --> 0:32:32,38
ESSENCE OF WHAT THE ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS
IS. THE ONLY


463
0:32:32,38 --> 0:32:34,71
THING THAT'S NOT SHOWN HERE THAT REALLY SHOULD
HAVE BEEN INCLUDED


464
0:32:34,71 --> 0:32:38,82
WAS THE ZYGOTE AFTER SYNGAMY. BUT YOU KNOW
I THINK JUST


465
0:32:38,82 --> 0:32:43,46
REMEMBER THAT AFTER FERTILIZATION, YOU GET
A ZYGOTE HERE. BUT


466
0:32:43,46 --> 0:32:45,679
THIS IS THE LIFE CYCLE WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING
THE REST OF THE


467
0:32:45,679 --> 0:32:45,679



468
0:32:45,679 --> 0:32:52,659
SEMESTER. AND IT HAS VARIOUS EMBELLISHMENTS
IN DIFFERENT


469
0:32:52,659 --> 0:32:59,529
GROUPS. AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET
THIS DOWN ASAP


470
0:32:59,529 --> 0:33:2,94
AFTER THE EXAM TONIGHT, OF COURSE. I'M NOT
GOING TO, YOU KNOW,


471
0:33:2,94 --> 0:33:5,69
YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO CLOUD YOUR MIND
WITH IT RIGHT NOW.


472
0:33:5,69 --> 0:33:10,62
BUT AFTER THE EXAM, YOU KNOW, REALLY GET THIS
DOWN BECAUSE I MEAN


473
0:33:10,62 --> 0:33:15,2
IN TERMS OF THESE MAJOR COMPONENTS, BECAUSE
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE


474
0:33:15,2 --> 0:33:19,38
GOING TO BE LOOKING AT FROM NOW ON, OKAY.
SO I JUST CAN'T


475
0:33:19,38 --> 0:33:24,659
EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS. AND
THE REASON I WANT


476
0:33:24,659 --> 0:33:28,86
TO SHOW YOU AN EXAMPLE IN THE SEA LETTUCE,
ULVA, IS BECAUSE THIS


477
0:33:28,86 --> 0:33:32,32
IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS
THAT THERE IS.


478
0:33:32,32 --> 0:33:38,1
ESSENTIALLY EXACTLY LIKE THAT OTHER SLIDE
I JUST SHOWED YOU.


479
0:33:38,1 --> 0:33:40,539
AND WHY I SAY IT'S SIMPLE IS BECAUSE IT'S
WHAT WE CALL AN ICE --


480
0:33:40,539 --> 0:33:44,13
THIS TERM ISN'T IMPORTANT, BUT IT'S WHAT WE
CALL AN ISOMORPHIC


481
0:33:44,13 --> 0:33:48,11
ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS WHERE THE SPOROPHYTE
AND THE


482
0:33:48,11 --> 0:33:53,49
GAMETOPHYTE LOOK IDENTICAL. ISOMORPHIC, ISO
MEANS THE SAME.


483
0:33:53,49 --> 0:33:58,73
MORPHIC, THE SAME MORPHOLOGY FOR BOTH THE
SPOROPHYTE AND THE


484
0:33:58,73 --> 0:34:3,77
GAMETOPHYTE. THOUGH WE HAVE THE SPOROPHYTE
HERE GIVING RISE


485
0:34:3,77 --> 0:34:8,799
THROUGH MEIOSIS TO ZOOSPORES. THESE ARE ACTUALLY
MOTILE SPORES,


486
0:34:8,799 --> 0:34:12,89
BUT THEY DON'T FUSE TOGETHER. THEY'RE NOT
GAMETES. THEY JUST


487
0:34:12,89 --> 0:34:18,28
UNDERGO MITOSES AND END UP DEVELOPING INTO
A HAPLOID GAMETOPHYTE.


488
0:34:18,28 --> 0:34:22,53
HAPLOID GAMETOPHYTE PRODUCES HAPLOID GAMETES
BY MITOSIS. THESE


489
0:34:22,53 --> 0:34:27,119
ARE GENETICALLY IDENTICAL TO THE HAPLOID GAMETOPHYTE.
AND THEN


490
0:34:27,119 --> 0:34:31,73
THEY FUSE TOGETHER TO PRODUCE THE ZYGOTE.
AND THAT ZYGOTE THEN


491
0:34:31,73 --> 0:34:36,5
AFTER MITOSES AND DEVELOPMENT, BECOMES A DIPLOID
SPOROPHYTE. SO


492
0:34:36,5 --> 0:34:39,52
THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY TELL THESE APART IS
IF YOU DID A


493
0:34:39,52 --> 0:34:39,52



494
0:34:39,52 --> 0:34:43,0
CHROMOSOME COUNT. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS
HAS TWICE AS MANY


495
0:34:43,0 --> 0:34:47,49
CHROMOSOMES AS THIS DOES, THESE TWO GENERATIONS.
ALSO IF YOU


496
0:34:47,49 --> 0:34:51,4
LOOKED AT THEIR REPRODUCTIVE STRUCTURES, THIS
IS PRODUCING


497
0:34:51,4 --> 0:34:57,46
SPORANGIA WHICH ARE HOLLOW SACS THAT PRODUCE
SPORES BY


498
0:34:57,46 --> 0:35:4,49
DEFINITION. AND THIS, THE GAMETOPHYTE PRODUCES
GAMETANGIA WHICH


499
0:35:4,49 --> 0:35:9,92
ARE BASICALLY HOLLOW SACS THAT PRODUCE GAMETES.
SO THAT'S THE


500
0:35:9,92 --> 0:35:12,609
REAL DIFFERENCE. BUT THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT
TO GO ON THERE.


501
0:35:12,609 --> 0:35:17,81
SO THIS IS A REALLY BEAUTIFUL CASE OF A, OF
AN ALTERNATION OF


502
0:35:17,81 --> 0:35:21,52
GENERATIONS WHERE THE TWO PHASES OF THE LIFE
CYCLE, WE CALL IT


503
0:35:21,52 --> 0:35:26,75
THE SPOROPHYTE OR DIPLOID PHASE AND THE GAMETOPHYTE
OR HAPLOID


504
0:35:26,75 --> 0:35:31,14
PHASE ARE, ARE VERY, VERY SIMILAR. YEAH?


505
0:35:31,14 --> 0:35:34,28
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]


506
0:35:34,28 --> 0:35:37,89
PROFESSOR: YEAH, THESE ARE FREE LIVING FROM
ONE ANOTHER. BUT


507
0:35:37,89 --> 0:35:41,76
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT BECAUSE WE'LL SEE
LATER IN THE LAND


508
0:35:41,76 --> 0:35:45,66
PLANTS THAT IT'S OFTEN THE CASE THAT THE GAMETOPHYTE
OR THE


509
0:35:45,66 --> 0:35:50,67
SPOROPHYTE IS DEPENDENT ON, ON ITS IMMEDIATE
PARENT. SO WE'LL


510
0:35:50,67 --> 0:35:54,97
SEE PARASITISM BY ONE GENERATION ON ANOTHER
GENERATION IN A LOT


511
0:35:54,97 --> 0:36:1,0
OF CASES. OKAY, SO AS FAR AS ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE
OF ALGAE, I'VE


512
0:36:1,0 --> 0:36:4,859
ALREADY MENTIONED DIATOMS AND DIATOMACEOUS
EARTH. BUT THERE'S


513
0:36:4,859 --> 0:36:9,18
SOME REALLY IMPORTANT COMPOUNDS THAT ARE HARVESTED
FROM BROWN


514
0:36:9,18 --> 0:36:12,32
ALGAE AND RED ALGAE IN PARTICULAR. AND I THOUGHT
THEY WERE


515
0:36:12,32 --> 0:36:15,52
WORTH MENTIONING. I ALREADY MENTIONED, WELL,
THERE ARE A LARGE


516
0:36:15,52 --> 0:36:18,91
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT RED AND BROWN ALGAE THAT
ARE HARVESTED AS


517
0:36:18,91 --> 0:36:23,79
EDIBLE SEAWEEDS USED EXTENSIVELY IN ASIAN
CUISINE. WE CAN'T


518
0:36:23,79 --> 0:36:28,92
REALLY, WE CAN'T DIGEST THOSE CARBOHYDRATES,
BUT THEY'RE A GOOD


519
0:36:28,92 --> 0:36:28,92



520
0:36:28,92 --> 0:36:34,24
SOURCE OF MINERALS, ROUGHAGE, ET CETERA. AND
ALSO THIS IS A RED


521
0:36:34,24 --> 0:36:36,53
ALGA ACTUALLY, NORI, THE ONE YOU'RE PROBABLY
THE MOST FAMILIAR


522
0:36:36,53 --> 0:36:40,55
WITH. BUT THERE ARE BROWNS AS WELL THAT ARE
USED IN JAPANESE


523
0:36:40,55 --> 0:36:46,65
CUISINE FOR EXAMPLE. ANOTHER COMPOUND HARVESTED
FROM RED ALGA


524
0:36:46,65 --> 0:36:51,859
IS AGAR. AND AGAR OF COURSE IS USED FOR BACTER-,
FOR MICROBIAL


525
0:36:51,859 --> 0:36:55,45
CULTURING IN PETRI DISHES. YOU KNOW THIS IS
OUR TYPICAL


526
0:36:55,45 --> 0:37:0,45
CULTURING MEDIUM IN SCIENTIFIC STUDIES OF
MICROBES AND MOLECULAR


527
0:37:0,45 --> 0:37:4,91
BIOLOGY. AND AGAROSE, A REFINED PRODUCT THERE,
IS USED IN


528
0:37:4,91 --> 0:37:9,73
ELECTROPHORESIS. SO IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SEPARATE
OUT DNA


529
0:37:9,73 --> 0:37:14,26
MOLECULES OF DIFFERENT SIZES, AGAROSE IS GENERALLY
THE MEDIUM


530
0:37:14,26 --> 0:37:21,89
THAT'S USED FOR GEL ELECTROPHORESIS FOR LARGE
FRAGMENTS, NOT IN


531
0:37:21,89 --> 0:37:25,81
DNA SEQUENCING WHERE YOU USE ACRYLAMIDE, BUT
FOR, FOR LARGER


532
0:37:25,81 --> 0:37:29,65
FRAGMENTS AGAROSE IS OFTEN USED. SO THESE,
FOR MICROBIOLOGY AND


533
0:37:29,65 --> 0:37:34,49
MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, RED ALGAE HAVE PROVEN TO
BE REALLY IMPORTANT.


534
0:37:34,49 --> 0:37:39,4
AND THEN THE BROWN ALGAE ARE SOURCES OF THINGS
LIKE


535
0:37:39,4 --> 0:37:42,99
POLYSACCHARIDES, THESE MUCILAGINOUS POLYSACCHARIDES
LIKE


536
0:37:42,99 --> 0:37:49,16
CARRAGEENAN AND ALGINATE THAT ARE USED AS
THICKENING AGENTS OR


537
0:37:49,16 --> 0:37:52,359
EMULSIFYING AGENTS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT
KINDS OF DRINKS


538
0:37:52,359 --> 0:37:58,64
AND FOODS. YOU'RE CONSTANTLY INGESTING ALGINATE
AND CARRAGEENAN


539
0:37:58,64 --> 0:38:2,32
IN PROCESSED FOODS. IT'S INCLUDED IN ALL KINDS
OF THINGS. I


540
0:38:2,32 --> 0:38:6,51
MEAN EVEN IN BEER, TO STABILIZE THE HEAD OF
BEERS, IN A LOT OF


541
0:38:6,51 --> 0:38:12,2
BEERS ALGINATE IS USED. IT'S PUT IN ICE CREAM
TO KEEP IT FROM


542
0:38:12,2 --> 0:38:16,7
MELTING AS QUICKLY AS IT WOULD OTHERWISE.
I MEAN THERE'S A LOT


543
0:38:16,7 --> 0:38:20,52
OF USES THAT YOU, THAT SPAN MUCH OF WHAT WE
TAKE FOR GRANTED IN


544
0:38:20,52 --> 0:38:24,82
OUR FOOD THAT COMES FROM BROWN ALGAE. AND
HERE YOU CAN SEE AN


545
0:38:24,82 --> 0:38:24,82



546
0:38:24,82 --> 0:38:28,25
EXAMPLE IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION OF ALGINATE
BEING USED AS THE


547
0:38:28,25 --> 0:38:32,56
MAIN MEDIUM FOR DENTAL IMPRESSIONS. SO THESE
ARE REALLY


548
0:38:32,56 --> 0:38:40,53
IMPORTANT SUBSTANCES THAT ARE USED IN A LOT
OF DIFFERENT WAYS.


549
0:38:40,53 --> 0:38:44,63
OKAY, SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO THE ORIGIN
OF LAND PLANTS.


550
0:38:44,63 --> 0:38:50,89
AND THIS SEGUES DIRECTLY FROM ALGAE BECAUSE
THE GREEN ALGAE AS


551
0:38:50,89 --> 0:38:54,68
YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS TREE HERE, HERE ARE
THE LAND PLANTS, THE


552
0:38:54,68 --> 0:38:59,599
GREEN ALGAE ARE A PARAPHYLETIC GROUP. THOUGH
THE GREEN ALGAE


553
0:38:59,599 --> 0:39:7,38
DON'T FORM A CLADE BY THEMSELVES. SOME GREEN
ALGAE, EXAMPLES


554
0:39:7,38 --> 0:39:11,96
SHOWN HERE, ARE MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO LAND
PLANTS THAN THEY ARE


555
0:39:11,96 --> 0:39:17,2
TO OTHER GREEN ALGAE. THOUGH THE SEA LETTUCE
AND SOME OF THESE


556
0:39:17,2 --> 0:39:22,99
MARINE ALGAE OR THE MARINE ALGAE IN GENERAL
ARE PRETTY DISTANTLY


557
0:39:22,99 --> 0:39:28,38
RELATED TO LAND PLANTS. AND THE CLOSEST RELATIVES
OF LAND


558
0:39:28,38 --> 0:39:32,849
PLANTS TURN OUT TO BE FRESHWATER ALGAE, FRESHWATER
GREEN ALGAE.


559
0:39:32,849 --> 0:39:36,31
SO THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT FROM THESE RESULTS,
WHICH COME BOTH


560
0:39:36,31 --> 0:39:40,5
FROM MORPHOLOGICAL DATA, MOSTLY ULTRASTRUCTURAL
CHARACTERS REALLY


561
0:39:40,5 --> 0:39:47,93
YOU CAN'T SEE WITH YOUR NAKED EYE, AND MOLECULAR
DATA, IS THAT


562
0:39:47,93 --> 0:39:54,65
THE LAND PLANTS EVOLVE FROM FRESHWATER HABITATS.
SO THIS


563
0:39:54,65 --> 0:39:57,76
CONCEPTION OF PLANTS HAVING INVADED LAND FROM
THE OCEAN IS


564
0:39:57,76 --> 0:40:2,68
MISCONSTRUED BASED ON AT LEAST THE MODERN
DIVERSITY. ALL OF THE


565
0:40:2,68 --> 0:40:6,69
GREEN ALGAE THAT WE KNOW OF THAT FALL OUT
IN THIS CLADE THAT'S


566
0:40:6,69 --> 0:40:12,839
SISTER TO THE LAND PLANTS OCCUR IN FRESHWATER.
SO THE ANCESTOR


567
0:40:12,839 --> 0:40:17,8
OF LAND PLANTS HAD TO FIRST INVADE FRESHWATER
IN THE CONTINENTAL


568
0:40:17,8 --> 0:40:24,28
SETTING. AND THEN FROM THERE, THEY INVADED
TERRESTRIAL


569
0:40:24,28 --> 0:40:26,839
HABITATS. AND IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. I MEAN
THAT'S, THAT


570
0:40:26,839 --> 0:40:32,239
SORT OF TRANSITION WOULD, WOULD MAKE ECOLOGICAL
SENSE. AND THIS


571
0:40:32,239 --> 0:40:32,24



572
0:40:32,24 --> 0:40:35,53
IS SOMETHING THAT'S PRETTY NOW WELL ESTABLISHED.
NOW THAT THE


573
0:40:35,53 --> 0:40:37,599
MOLECULAR DATA IS AVAILABLE, PEOPLE HAVE GONE
IN AND LOOKED AT


574
0:40:37,599 --> 0:40:40,13
THE MORPHOLOGY MORE CLOSELY. AND THERE'S A
WHOLE LIST OF


575
0:40:40,13 --> 0:40:43,92
FEATURES THAT ARE IN YOUR TEXTBOOK YOU CAN
LOOK AT, LOOK IT UP IF


576
0:40:43,92 --> 0:40:49,79
YOU'D LIKE. ONE OF MOST INTERESTING ONES,
I'LL GET TO THAT IN A


577
0:40:49,79 --> 0:40:52,77
MOMENT ACTUALLY. BUT ANYWAYS, THE THING THAT'S
COME OUT OF THIS


578
0:40:52,77 --> 0:40:57,72
IS THAT WE REALLY CAN'T HAVE A PHYLUM CALLED
GREEN ALGAE, YOU


579
0:40:57,72 --> 0:41:2,359
KNOW, THAT DOESN'T, DOESN'T WORK SINCE THEY'RE
PARAPHYLETIC.


580
0:41:2,359 --> 0:41:6,72
THE LAND PLANTS APPEAR TO BE MONOPHYLETIC.
AND THESE FRESHWATER


581
0:41:6,72 --> 0:41:9,77
GREEN ALGAE THAT ARE CLOSE RELATIVES ARE MONOPHYLETIC.
THESE


582
0:41:9,77 --> 0:41:13,74
TAKEN TOGETHER ARE MONOPHYLETIC GROUPS, SOMETIMES
CALLED THE


583
0:41:13,74 --> 0:41:19,28
STREPTOPHYTES. AND ALL OF THE GREEN PLANTS,
ALL THE GREEN


584
0:41:19,28 --> 0:41:23,25
ORGANISMS NOW ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO BY BOTANISTS
AS THE GREEN


585
0:41:23,25 --> 0:41:27,31
PLANTS. SO THE GREEN ALGAE PLUS THE LAND PLANTS
TOGETHER THEY


586
0:41:27,31 --> 0:41:32,99
MAKE UP ONE BIG MONOPHYLETIC GROUP OF GREEN
ORGANISMS. AND


587
0:41:32,99 --> 0:41:36,5
THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL OFTEN SEE REFERRED TO AS
THE GREEN PLANTS OR


588
0:41:36,5 --> 0:41:43,89
VIRIDIPLANTAE. OKAY, SO ARE THERE QUESTIONS
ABOUT THAT? WELL,


589
0:41:43,89 --> 0:41:47,54
HERE'S WHAT ONE OF THOSE, OH, SORRY, SO HERE
WE GO ON TO LAND.


590
0:41:47,54 --> 0:41:52,13
AND HERE'S ONE OF THOSE FRESHWATER GREEN ALGAE.
THIS IS THE


591
0:41:52,13 --> 0:41:57,67
GENUS CHARA THAT THE, THE PHYLUM IS NAMED
FOR, THE CHAROPHYTES


592
0:41:57,67 --> 0:42:2,99
THAT ARE THE CLOSES RELATIVES OF LAND PLANTS
LIKE MOSSES. AGAIN


593
0:42:2,99 --> 0:42:6,609
FRESHWATER. THESE HAVE A LIFE CYCLE THAT IS
NOT AN ALTERNATION


594
0:42:6,609 --> 0:42:12,49
OF GENERATIONS. THESE CHAROPHYTES, THE ONLY
DIPLOID STAGE IN


595
0:42:12,49 --> 0:42:17,14
THESE CHAROPHYTES IS THE ZYGOTE. SO THEY'RE
MORE LIKE FUNGI IN


596
0:42:17,14 --> 0:42:21,72
THAT SENSE. THEY UNDERGO MEIOSIS IMMEDIATELY
AFTER


597
0:42:21,72 --> 0:42:21,81



598
0:42:21,81 --> 0:42:26,41
FERTILIZATION. THOUGH THE ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS
WAS NOT


599
0:42:26,41 --> 0:42:31,7
PRESENT IN THE CLOSEST, IN THE AQUATIC ANCESTORS
OF LAND PLANTS,


600
0:42:31,7 --> 0:42:37,31
BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT APPEARS TO HAVE EVOLVED
SUBSEQUENTLY.


601
0:42:37,31 --> 0:42:39,849
BUT WE HAVE AN ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS
IN ALL THE LAND PLANTS


602
0:42:39,849 --> 0:42:46,27
LIKE THE MOSSES. OKAY, SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT
POINT TO CONSIDER.


603
0:42:46,27 --> 0:42:50,48
AND THESE CHAROPHYTES INCLUDE UNICELLULAR
AS WELL AS


604
0:42:50,48 --> 0:42:55,7
MULTICELLULAR THINGS LIKE THIS. SO THE MULTICELLULAR
CONDITION


605
0:42:55,7 --> 0:43:0,76
MAY BE INDEPENDENTLY DERIVED AS WELL IN THE
LAND PLANTS. BRAD?


606
0:43:0,76 --> 0:43:7,359
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].


607
0:43:7,359 --> 0:43:12,26
PROFESSOR: THE ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS
THAT WE SEE IN


608
0:43:12,26 --> 0:43:16,4
SOMETHING LIKE ULVA, THE SEA LETTUCE, PROBABLY
EVOLVED


609
0:43:16,4 --> 0:43:20,17
SEPARATELY. SO THE ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS
WE SEE IN LAND


610
0:43:20,17 --> 0:43:23,67
PLANTS IS PROBABLY OF SEPARATE ORIGIN. AND
YOU CAN SEE IT, I'LL


611
0:43:23,67 --> 0:43:25,77
SHOW YOU AS WE GO THROUGH HERE THAT WE HAVE
A REALLY NICE


612
0:43:25,77 --> 0:43:32,52
PROGRESSION IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE SPOROPHYTE
GENERATION. SO


613
0:43:32,52 --> 0:43:38,609
BASICALLY THE, THE MAIN ADULT BODY OF A CHAROPHYTE
WAS HAPLOID.


614
0:43:38,609 --> 0:43:42,73
AND WHAT WE SEE IN THE MOSSES AND THE OTHER
PLANTS WE CALL


615
0:43:42,73 --> 0:43:49,81
BRYOPHYTES, WHICH ARE THIS PART OF THE TREE
OF LAND PLANTS,


616
0:43:49,81 --> 0:43:54,4
THESE ARE ALL THE LAND PLANTS HERE, THE BRYOPHYTES
HERE, THEIR


617
0:43:54,4 --> 0:43:58,89
MAIN REPRO-, THEIR MAIN VEGETATIVE BODY THAT'S
PHYTOSYNTHETIC, OR


618
0:43:58,89 --> 0:44:2,91
THE MAIN PHOTOSYNTHESIS AT LEAST THAT GOES
ON IN THEM, IS THE


619
0:44:2,91 --> 0:44:9,5
GAMETOPHYTE IS THE HAPLOID GENERATION. AND
THE DIPLOID PHASE IS


620
0:44:9,5 --> 0:44:13,329
VERY REDUCED. I SHOULDN'T SAY IT'S REDUCED.
IT'S VERY SMALL.


621
0:44:13,329 --> 0:44:17,1
THESE THINGS PROBABLY, THE LAND PLANTS PROB-,
EVOLVED FROM AN


622
0:44:17,1 --> 0:44:22,549
ANCESTOR THAT PROBABLY LACKED ANY SPOROPHYTE
PHASE, A DIPLOID


623
0:44:22,549 --> 0:44:22,66



624
0:44:22,66 --> 0:44:28,25
PHASE. AND SO WE SEE VERY, VERY SMALL LITTLE
SPOROPHYTES IN


625
0:44:28,25 --> 0:44:31,51
THESE. AND WHAT WE'LL SEE AS WE GO THROUGH
HERE IS THAT THE


626
0:44:31,51 --> 0:44:35,44
SPOROPHYTE GETS PROGRESSIVELY MORE COMPLEX
AND IMPORTANT IN THE


627
0:44:35,44 --> 0:44:40,26
LIFE CYCLE. THAT'S A THEME IN THE LAND PLANTS
THAT WE START OUT


628
0:44:40,26 --> 0:44:44,14
WITH THE GAMETOPHYTE, THE HAPLOID GENERATION
BEING DOMINANT AND


629
0:44:44,14 --> 0:44:47,859
EVENTUALLY THE DIPLOID SPOROPHYTE GENERATION
BECOMES DOMINANT IN


630
0:44:47,859 --> 0:44:50,7
THE LAND, IN THE VASCULAR PLANTS, WHICH ARE
THE PLANTS THAT WE


631
0:44:50,7 --> 0:44:53,57
SEE MOSTLY AROUND US THAT HAVE, THAT ARE BIG
AND HAVE MAJOR


632
0:44:53,57 --> 0:45:1,849
CONDUCTING TISSUE. BUT THE BRYOPHYTES INCLUDE
THE MOSSES, THE


633
0:45:1,849 --> 0:45:7,44
HORNWORTS, AND THE LIVERWORTS. AND THE ENDING
WORT, W-O-R-T,


634
0:45:7,44 --> 0:45:14,0
JUST MEANS HERB. IT DOESN'T MEAN SOME SORT
OF, SOME SORT OF,


635
0:45:14,0 --> 0:45:16,32
YOU KNOW, LITTLE CARBUNCLE OR SOMETHING ON
THESE THINGS. THESE


636
0:45:16,32 --> 0:45:21,19
THINGS HAVE, WORT IS JUST AN ENGLISH TERM
FOR A HERB AS OPPOSED


637
0:45:21,19 --> 0:45:25,589
TO A WOODY PLANT. OKAY, SO THERE ARE THREE
MAJOR GROUPS OF


638
0:45:25,589 --> 0:45:29,339
BRYOPHYTES AS THEY'RE CALLED. AND THE BRYOPHYTES
APPEAR TO BE


639
0:45:29,339 --> 0:45:33,41
PARAPHYLETIC. WE WERE JUST SEEING HOW THE
GREEN ALGAE LOOKED


640
0:45:33,41 --> 0:45:39,27
PARAPHYLETIC RELATIVE TO THE LAND PLANTS.
THE BRYOPHYTES ARE


641
0:45:39,27 --> 0:45:44,589
PARAPHYLETIC RELATIVE TO THE VASCULAR PLANTS,
OKAY. AND THE


642
0:45:44,589 --> 0:45:52,44
VASCULAR PLANTS INCLUDE THE FERNS, THE, ALL
THE SEED PLANTS, THE


643
0:45:52,44 --> 0:45:54,82
CLUB MOSSES AND SPIKE MOSSES AND QUILLWORTS.
THESE ARE


644
0:45:54,82 --> 0:45:57,14
BASICALLY ALL THE REALLY CONSPICUOUS PLANTS
THAT YOU SEE OUT IN


645
0:45:57,14 --> 0:46:1,67
THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THE MOSSES, THE HORNWORTS
AND LIVERWORTS,


646
0:46:1,67 --> 0:46:5,26
ARE VERY SMALL PLANTS. THEY RARELY GET OVER
15 CENTIMETERS IN


647
0:46:5,26 --> 0:46:9,26
HEIGHT, YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY


648
0:46:9,26 --> 0:46:14,3
DON'T HAVE THE SORT OF HIGHLY REINFORCED CONDUCTING
TISSUE THAT


649
0:46:14,3 --> 0:46:14,3



650
0:46:14,3 --> 0:46:20,369
ALLOWS THEM TO RETAIN LARGE SIZES. BUT THEY'RE,
ANYWAYS,


651
0:46:20,369 --> 0:46:24,579
THEY'RE THREE DISTINCT GROUPS THAT HAD ALREADY
STARTED TO


652
0:46:24,579 --> 0:46:29,329
DIVERSIFY INTO THESE MAJOR LINEAGES BEFORE
THE VASCULAR PLANTS


653
0:46:29,329 --> 0:46:34,66
ORIGINATED. AND WE COULD REALLY SAY ESSENTIALLY
THAT THE


654
0:46:34,66 --> 0:46:38,47
BRYOPHYTES GAVE RISE TO THE VASCULAR PLANTS,
THESE LARGER PLANTS


655
0:46:38,47 --> 0:46:42,24
THAT HAVE CONDUCTING TISSUE, GIVEN THAT THEY
CONSTITUTE A GRADE


656
0:46:42,24 --> 0:46:45,15
OR PARAPHYLETIC GROUP WITHIN WHICH THE VASCULAR
PLANTS ARE


657
0:46:45,15 --> 0:46:52,49
NESTED. ARE THERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT? YEAH,
BRAD?


658
0:46:52,49 --> 0:46:59,8
STUDENT: SO IF THE BRYOPHYTES DON'T HAVE THAT
 -- (INAUDIBLE).


659
0:46:59,8 --> 0:47:1,349
PROFESSOR: YEAH, THEY, THE LIVERWORTS, I SHOULD
SAY THE MOSSES


660
0:47:1,349 --> 0:47:5,369
ACTUALLY DO HAVE SOME CONDUCTING TISSUE. AND
THEY'RE THE ONLY


661
0:47:5,369 --> 0:47:8,57
MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP THAT CAN GET FAIRLY
SIZEABLE. THERE ARE,


662
0:47:8,57 --> 0:47:11,17
IN FACT, SOME MOSSES THAT CAN GET UP TO A
COUPLE METERS IN


663
0:47:11,17 --> 0:47:15,89
HEIGHT, AND THEY HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED LEPTOIDS
AND HYDROIDS.


664
0:47:15,89 --> 0:47:18,41
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT, BUT THEY HAVE SOME CONDUCTING
CELLS THAT


665
0:47:18,41 --> 0:47:23,29
MOVE AROUND WATER AS WELL AS NUTRIENTS IN
THEIR TISSUES. BUT IT


666
0:47:23,29 --> 0:47:28,829
ISN'T REINFORCED BY LIGNIN WHICH IS THE CASE
IN, THAT WAS WHAT WE


667
0:47:28,829 --> 0:47:32,74
SEE IN THE VASCULAR TISSUE OF VASCULAR PLANTS.
AND LIGNIN


668
0:47:32,74 --> 0:47:36,93
IMPARTS GREAT STRENGTH TO THE CONDUCTING TISSUE,
IN PARTICULAR


669
0:47:36,93 --> 0:47:41,26
THE XYLEM, THE WATER CONDUCTING TISSUE. IT
ALLOWS VASCULAR


670
0:47:41,26 --> 0:47:44,67
PLANTS TO GET, TO BE LARGE BRANCHED SPOROPHYTES,
TO HAVE LARGE


671
0:47:44,67 --> 0:47:50,53
BRANCHED SPOROPHYTES. HORNWORTS AND LIVERWORTS
DON'T HAVE THOSE


672
0:47:50,53 --> 0:47:53,26
LEPTOIDS AND HYDROIDS, AND THEY'RE PRETTY
MUCH AS I'LL SHOW YOU


673
0:47:53,26 --> 0:47:58,4
HERE, WELL, LET'S GO TO THE LIFE CYCLE FIRST
OF BRYOPHYTES TO


674
0:47:58,4 --> 0:48:3,13
MAKE THIS POINT. AND I AM NOT SO SURE I'M
GOING TO BE ABLE TO


675
0:48:3,13 --> 0:48:3,13



676
0:48:3,13 --> 0:48:5,829
GET THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE OF BRYOPHYTES IN
THREE MINUTES, OR TWO


677
0:48:5,829 --> 0:48:9,54
MINUTES. BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE THE POINT
FIRST, AND WE'LL GET


678
0:48:9,54 --> 0:48:14,9
BACK TO THIS NEXT TIME, BUT AS I WAS SAYING,
THE GAMETOPHYTE, THE


679
0:48:14,9 --> 0:48:21,79
HAPLOID PHASE OF BRYOPHYTES IS THE GREEN PHOTOSYNTHETIC
DOMINANT


680
0:48:21,79 --> 0:48:27,23
PHASE. AND YOU CAN SEE A TYPICAL MOSS GAMETOPHYTE
RIGHT HERE.


681
0:48:27,23 --> 0:48:32,71
AND AGAIN, IT'S GERMINATING FROM SPORES. IT
HAS A FILAMENTOUS


682
0:48:32,71 --> 0:48:35,8
FORM EARLY ITS DEVELOPMENT AND THEN GETS TO
BE MORE OF


683
0:48:35,8 --> 0:48:39,99
LEAFY-LIKE, HAS A, LOOKS LIKE A LEAFY STEM.
BUT THIS IS A


684
0:48:39,99 --> 0:48:43,88
GAMETOPHYTE NOT A SPOROPHYTE. SO THE, THE
STRUCTURES THAT LOOK


685
0:48:43,88 --> 0:48:47,43
LIKE LEAVES ARE NOT TRULY HOMOLOGOUS TO THE
LEAVES WE SEE IN LAND


686
0:48:47,43 --> 0:48:51,45
PLANTS THAT ARE IN THE SPOROPHYTE GENERATION.
BUT IN ANY CASE,


687
0:48:51,45 --> 0:48:56,71
THIS IS A GAMETOPHYTE. AND THEN IT PRODUCES
GAMETANGIA UP IN THE


688
0:48:56,71 --> 0:49:2,97
TIPS HERE. AND WE'LL GET TO THE GAMETANGIA
LATER. BUT


689
0:49:2,97 --> 0:49:5,93
BASICALLY THE SPOROPHYTE IS JUST THIS STRUCTURE
HERE. IT'S


690
0:49:5,93 --> 0:49:9,68
PARASITIC ON THE GAMETOPHYTE. IT GROWS OUT
OF IT. AND IT'S


691
0:49:9,68 --> 0:49:13,599
PRETTY MUCH JUST A SPORANGIUM ON A STALK.
THOUGH WE HAVE A


692
0:49:13,599 --> 0:49:21,76
HIGHLY REDUCED OR I SHOULD SAY A SMALL SPOROPHYTE
WHERE WE HAVE


693
0:49:21,76 --> 0:49:26,98
MEIOSIS GIVING RISE TO SPORES. SO THIS IS
JUST AN INTRO TO THE


694
0:49:26,98 --> 0:49:30,66
BRYOPHYTE LIFE CYCLE. AND WE'LL TALK MORE
ABOUT IT NEXT TIME.


695
0:49:30,66 --> 0:49:35,75
SO REMEMBER TO SET YOUR CLOCK, CLOCKS BACK
AGAIN. AND GOOD LUCK


696
0:49:35,75 --> 0:49:36,89
ON THE EXAM TONIGHT.


697
0:49:36,89 --> 0:51:36,89
