1
0:0:0,52 --> 0:0:1,319
Hi everyone.


2
0:0:1,319 --> 0:0:6,1
I'm Dr. Craig Hazen, director of the master's
degree program in Christian Apologetics at


3
0:0:6,1 --> 0:0:9,4
Biola University in Southern California.


4
0:0:9,4 --> 0:0:14,26
Although our campus is thousands of miles
away from tonight's debate on the campus of


5
0:0:14,26 --> 0:0:16,76
Purdue,
Biola University has become a center point


6
0:0:16,76 --> 0:0:19,73
for discussion and engagements on the big
ideas


7
0:0:19,73 --> 0:0:25,11
that have really challenged humankind for
centuries-like tonight's big question:


8
0:0:25,11 --> 0:0:27,43
Is faith in God Reasonable?


9
0:0:27,43 --> 0:0:31,82
I want to thank Biola University's partners
for the live streaming of this event.


10
0:0:31,82 --> 0:0:37,0
The first partner is Symposia Christi which
is a coalition of campus ministry groups at


11
0:0:37,0 --> 0:0:41,36
Purdue,
and the second is Reasonable Faith - the organization


12
0:0:41,36 --> 0:0:46,51
that supports the scholarship, speaking, and
debates of Dr. William Lane Craig.


13
0:0:46,51 --> 0:0:50,98
We're joined this evening by 5,000 people
on the Purdue campus


14
0:0:50,98 --> 0:0:55,1
and tens of thousands from around the world
who have signed in to watch this important


15
0:0:55,1 --> 0:0:56,79
exchange of ideas.


16
0:0:56,79 --> 0:1:0,219
One of our goals in bringing this debate to
you live


17
0:1:0,219 --> 0:1:5,99
is to help ignite a robust dialogue.
And we want you to be part of the conversation.


18
0:1:5,99 --> 0:1:10,729
So fire up Twitter and tweet commentary for
the world.


19
0:1:10,729 --> 0:1:17,79
You can also submit questions to the debaters
online to be answered during the live Q&A.


20
0:1:17,79 --> 0:1:21,99
Now, once tonight's debate is over there's
a good chance you'll want to see it again


21
0:1:21,99 --> 0:1:28,459
or alert others to it so they can watch.
If so, just point them to a site called Open


22
0:1:28,459 --> 0:1:32,229
Biola.
But jot down the address for yourself as well


23
0:1:32,229 --> 0:1:35,649
because there is
a treasure trove of quality academic content


24
0:1:35,649 --> 0:1:38,539
at that site --
and it's all for free.


25
0:1:38,539 --> 0:1:40,539
So be sure to check it out.


26
0:1:40,539 --> 0:1:46,29
The debaters you will see tonight are both
academic philosophers and are at the top of


27
0:1:46,29 --> 0:1:48,79
their game.


28
0:1:48,79 --> 0:1:53,24
Answering "no" to the question "is faith in
God reasonable?" will be


29
0:1:53,24 --> 0:2:0,189
Dr. Alex Rosenberg who is the R. Taylor Cole
Professor of Philosophy at Duke University


30
0:2:0,189 --> 0:2:4,719
and head of the Philosophy Department.
He's a prolific author having written over


31
0:2:4,719 --> 0:2:10,59
a dozen books and hundreds of articles.
His latest book is titled "An Atheist's Guide


32
0:2:10,59 --> 0:2:12,49
to Reality."


33
0:2:12,49 --> 0:2:16,99
On the other side of platform tonight and
answering "yes" to the question "is faith


34
0:2:16,99 --> 0:2:18,92
in God reasonable?" will be


35
0:2:18,92 --> 0:2:25,32
Dr. William Lane Craig who is a Research Professor
of Philosophy at the Talbot School of Theology


36
0:2:25,32 --> 0:2:29,78
at Biola University.
Dr. Craig is likewise an author of dozens


37
0:2:29,78 --> 0:2:31,98
of books and hundreds of articles.


38
0:2:31,98 --> 0:2:36,5
And of course Dr. William Lane Craig teaches
courses in my own department --


39
0:2:36,5 --> 0:2:40,28
the master of arts degree program in Christian
Apologetics at Biola,


40
0:2:40,28 --> 0:2:44,72
which has been voted the best program of its
kind in the world on several occasions.


41
0:2:44,72 --> 0:2:48,82
If you have considered doing graduate work
in this fascinating field of study,


42
0:2:48,82 --> 0:2:55,76
we'd be delighted to send you more information.
Just contact us or log on to biola.edu.


43
0:2:55,76 --> 0:3:0,22
We've developed one of the finest distance
learning programs available anywhere,


44
0:3:0,22 --> 0:3:5,68
so you can earn a master's degree in apologetics
or in the field of science and religion without


45
0:3:5,68 --> 0:3:10,3
uprooting or moving.
The degree program is convenient, it's very


46
0:3:10,3 --> 0:3:14,46
stimulating, and it's affordable.
And you don't need a background in philosophy


47
0:3:14,46 --> 0:3:17,6
or theology to start it --
we'll give you everything you need to get


48
0:3:17,6 --> 0:3:19,55
up to speed.


49
0:3:19,55 --> 0:3:25,21
We also have a certificate program in apologetics
and educational resources that are available


50
0:3:25,21 --> 0:3:26,85
to everyone.


51
0:3:26,85 --> 0:3:31,35
Of special interest to viewers of this debate
will be boxed sets


52
0:3:31,35 --> 0:3:36,72
of Dr. Craig's previous debates with opponents
like Christopher Hitchens, Frank Zindler,


53
0:3:36,72 --> 0:3:40,85
Bart Ehrman, and more.
You might also be interested in the boxed


54
0:3:40,85 --> 0:3:44,8
set of study materials called
"On Guard" - a popular guide to Christian


55
0:3:44,8 --> 0:3:48,8
thought and philosophy
authored by Dr. Craig and available through


56
0:3:48,8 --> 0:3:50,8
Biola University.


57
0:3:50,8 --> 0:3:54,85
One last thing.
If you enjoy the ideas and want to introduce


58
0:3:54,85 --> 0:3:59,13
them to your church or community,
consider hosting an Apologetics Conference


59
0:3:59,13 --> 0:4:3,22
in your area.
Our Apologetics Program at Biola can supply


60
0:4:3,22 --> 0:4:7,13
everything you need
to put on an amazing event with benefits for


61
0:4:7,13 --> 0:4:9,31
everyone who attends.


62
0:4:9,31 --> 0:4:14,6
Well I think you're catching on to the idea
that it's easy for the learning to continue


63
0:4:14,6 --> 0:4:18,9
after tonight's debate.
And I hope you take advantage of all of it.


64
0:4:18,9 --> 0:4:22,43
Enjoy the debate and we'll see you on Twitter!


65
0:4:22,43 --> 0:4:36,15
Mr. Miller: Good evening and welcome!
Come on in and let's have a seat.


66
0:4:36,15 --> 0:4:40,65
Thank you for coming.
Given the vastness of the audience that would


67
0:4:40,65 --> 0:4:44,83
be watching this debate tonight here and across
the world,


68
0:4:44,83 --> 0:4:50,499
you know sometimes and at some places in America
we like to say,


69
0:4:50,499 --> 0:4:59,61
"LLLLets get ready to rumblllllle."
It's going to be an exciting night.


70
0:4:59,61 --> 0:5:5,889
Welcome to the main event - The Symposium
2013 where the theme is The Foolishness of


71
0:5:5,889 --> 0:5:6,819
Faith.


72
0:5:6,819 --> 0:5:11,879
The Christian faith is often viewed as foolishness
by those who don't believe it


73
0:5:11,879 --> 0:5:17,11
and it is viewed as life preserving and giving
by those who do.


74
0:5:17,11 --> 0:5:20,43
The purpose of the symposium annually is to
explore and debate


75
0:5:20,43 --> 0:5:24,979
some of the most probing questions about faith,
reason, and life


76
0:5:24,979 --> 0:5:29,289
through lectures, panel discussions, and debates
such as this.


77
0:5:29,289 --> 0:5:33,259
We welcome those of you attending tonight's
debate here at Elliot Hall of Music at Purdue


78
0:5:33,259 --> 0:5:39,69
University
and we welcome those watching this live streaming,


79
0:5:39,69 --> 0:5:47,439
some estimated 10,000.
(Audience clapping).


80
0:5:47,439 --> 0:5:53,8
Those 10,000 people represent people from
every state in America


81
0:5:53,8 --> 0:5:58,229
and as of 10 a.m. this morning from over 60
countries across the world.


82
0:5:58,229 --> 0:6:3,139
This is great.
(Audience clapping).


83
0:6:3,139 --> 0:6:6,36
We're happy to include translators tonight
so that the deaf community


84
0:6:6,36 --> 0:6:11,21
can participate in this for years to come
when we put this on YouTube by the end of


85
0:6:11,21 --> 0:6:14,809
the month.
We are thankful for more than 40 sponsors


86
0:6:14,809 --> 0:6:17,8
many of which were included on the screen
behind me.


87
0:6:17,8 --> 0:6:22,719
As you were entering, perhaps you saw that,
or in the brochures, or on our website at


88
0:6:22,719 --> 0:6:29,12
www.symposiachristi.com.
We're also grateful to Purdue's Philosophy


89
0:6:29,12 --> 0:6:33,409
Department for sharing the cost of
flying in one of our debaters so that he could


90
0:6:33,409 --> 0:6:36,89
speak in their department yesterday.


91
0:6:36,89 --> 0:6:40,87
My name is Mr. Corey Miller.
I will be the moderator for tonight's debate


92
0:6:40,87 --> 0:6:46,86
and the MC throughout the weekend,
where we've got a fantastic series of talks


93
0:6:46,86 --> 0:6:53,689
scheduled for you by a dozen speakers,
maybe 35 talks on issues relevant to tonight's


94
0:6:53,689 --> 0:6:57,3
debate.
I'm on staff with Faculty Commons, the Faculty


95
0:6:57,3 --> 0:7:0,129
Ministry of Cru.
I direct the Christian Faculty Staff Network


96
0:7:0,129 --> 0:7:4,4
here at Purdue.
I'm also a PhD candidate in Philosophical


97
0:7:4,4 --> 0:7:9,71
Theology and teach adjunct courses
in Philosophy and Comparative Religions at


98
0:7:9,71 --> 0:7:12,639
Indiana University in Kokomo.


99
0:7:12,639 --> 0:7:16,969
Our Purdue audience should have a pencil and
paper that you were given on your way in


100
0:7:16,969 --> 0:7:22,189
to fill out some basic information including
your vote on who won tonight's debate


101
0:7:22,189 --> 0:7:31,439
and you can do that by pencil or completed
online at www.biola.edu/debate.


102
0:7:31,439 --> 0:7:35,93
It should go without saying but please wait
until after the debate to decide who won.


103
0:7:35,93 --> 0:7:39,68
I know some of us just love our guy that's
going to be up here,


104
0:7:39,68 --> 0:7:42,599
but it's more fun this way if you wait until
after the debate.


105
0:7:42,599 --> 0:7:47,849
We'll collect these right after the debate
and prior to the question and answer time,


106
0:7:47,849 --> 0:7:50,649
so please write legibly if you're writing.


107
0:7:50,649 --> 0:7:58,89
We also want to welcome some special dignitaries
who will help formally judge tonight's debate,


108
0:7:58,89 --> 0:8:2,149
wait until all of them are announced, and
then please welcome the judges.


109
0:8:2,149 --> 0:8:7,2
Judges once I announce you individually please
stand up and greet the audience.


110
0:8:7,2 --> 0:8:11,68
First of all John Schultz,
a fifth year PhD student in political science


111
0:8:11,68 --> 0:8:16,99
and head of the Purdue Petticrew Debate Forum.
He will head up the judge team and has helped


112
0:8:16,99 --> 0:8:20,68
organized and formed this judge team tonight.


113
0:8:20,68 --> 0:8:31,289
Sheila Klinker is on her way.
Sheila, she never misses a beat; she'll be


114
0:8:31,289 --> 0:8:33,65
here.
Sheila graduated from Purdue and is a member


115
0:8:33,65 --> 0:8:38,71
of the Indiana State Senate.
I'm sorry no ... House of Representatives,


116
0:8:38,71 --> 0:8:43,93
a Democratic representing ...
that's smooth, the enemy, representing the


117
0:8:43,93 --> 0:8:47,31
27th district since 1982.


118
0:8:47,31 --> 0:8:51,21
Ron Alting graduated from Purdue and is a
member of the Indiana State Senate,


119
0:8:51,21 --> 0:8:56,44
a Republican representing the 22nd district
serving Tippecanoe County.


120
0:8:56,44 --> 0:9:1,58
Aaron Trembath and an alum of Purdue's Entrepreneurship
and Innovation Program.


121
0:9:1,58 --> 0:9:8,69
He is the President and CEO of NanoBio Interfacing
Systems and Nano Technology-Based Diagnostics


122
0:9:8,69 --> 0:9:14,14
Company in Purdue Research Park.
Before coaching Purdue's speech and debate


123
0:9:14,14 --> 0:9:17,9
team, he was pretty successful in debate himself.


124
0:9:17,9 --> 0:9:22,97
Professor Fenggang Yang from Purdue University,
a Professor of Sociology, and Director of


125
0:9:22,97 --> 0:9:29,56
the Center on Religion and Chinese society.
The professor previously taught philosophy


126
0:9:29,56 --> 0:9:32,34
at a university in Beijing, China.


127
0:9:32,34 --> 0:9:37,59
Professor Martin Medhurst is a Distinguished
Professor of Rhetoric and Communication


128
0:9:37,59 --> 0:9:48,56
and Professor of Political Science at Baylor
University, in Waco, Texas.


129
0:9:48,56 --> 0:9:54,86
Clarke Rountree, another professor also flown
in here just recently like Dr. Medhurst.


130
0:9:54,86 --> 0:9:59,41
He is Professor and Chair of the Communications
Arts Faculty flown in tonight from the University


131
0:9:59,41 --> 0:10:0,91
of Alabama in Huntsville.


132
0:10:0,91 --> 0:10:13,26
Let's welcome our distinguished guests.
(Audience clapping).


133
0:10:13,26 --> 0:10:17,82
A colleague, Paul Gould, and myself
will be editing a book to be published by


134
0:10:17,82 --> 0:10:20,8
Routledge
based on the proceedings of tonight's debate


135
0:10:20,8 --> 0:10:23,83
which will include the two debaters we'll
announce in a moment,


136
0:10:23,83 --> 0:10:27,69
the two Rhetoric professors we just mentioned
and two other philosophers


137
0:10:27,69 --> 0:10:33,25
and two physics professors with an equal divide
of Christians and atheist along the lines.


138
0:10:33,25 --> 0:10:38,51
The debate tonight will continue under the
forthcoming title Is Faith in God Reasonable,


139
0:10:38,51 --> 0:10:42,63
Debates in Philosophy, Science and Rhetoric.
We'll let you know when that comes out through


140
0:10:42,63 --> 0:10:47,68
your contact information,
so make sure you give us the basic information.


141
0:10:47,68 --> 0:10:52,53
Turning to the corner here,
the famous anti-theist Samuel Clemens, otherwise


142
0:10:52,53 --> 0:10:58,31
known as Mark Twain once said,
"Faith is believing something you know ain't


143
0:10:58,31 --> 0:11:3,3
true."
I don't know if that has unanimous consent.


144
0:11:3,3 --> 0:11:9,22
The most famous of Jewish and Christian philosophers
perhaps of all time, at least in a particular


145
0:11:9,22 --> 0:11:12,95
period,
Moses Maimonides and Thomas Aquinas believed


146
0:11:12,95 --> 0:11:18,31
that faith is a virtue.
Indeed Aquinas went so far as to say that


147
0:11:18,31 --> 0:11:22,58
"Without faith, the virtue of faith, none
of the other virtues are even virtuous."


148
0:11:22,58 --> 0:11:25,71
John Calvin, the Protestant Reformer, claimed
that,


149
0:11:25,71 --> 0:11:30,81
"It would be the height of absurdity to label
ignorance tempered by humility, faith;


150
0:11:30,81 --> 0:11:38,38
for faith consists in the knowledge of God."
For Maimonides, Aquinas and Calvin then, faith


151
0:11:38,38 --> 0:11:44,13
is part of a knowledge tradition.
Yet in contemporary times, the Philosopher


152
0:11:44,13 --> 0:11:48,54
Norman Malcolm has said that
"In our Western academic philosophy, religious


153
0:11:48,54 --> 0:11:54,29
belief is commonly regarded as unreasonable
and is viewed with condescension or even contempt."


154
0:11:54,29 --> 0:11:57,86
"It is said that religion is a refuge for
those who,


155
0:11:57,86 --> 0:12:4,15
because of weakness of intellect or character,
they're unable to confront the stern realities


156
0:12:4,15 --> 0:12:7,59
of the world."
"The objective, mature, strong attitude is


157
0:12:7,59 --> 0:12:10,87
to hold beliefs solely on the basis of evidence."


158
0:12:10,87 --> 0:12:15,9
To this provocative statement much, can, and
should,


159
0:12:15,9 --> 0:12:19,71
and now will be said as we turn toward tonight's
debate over the question,


160
0:12:19,71 --> 0:12:23,49
is faith in God reasonable?


161
0:12:23,49 --> 0:12:26,98
Our first debater will argue the affirmative
and consequently will go first


162
0:12:26,98 --> 0:12:30,34
as is the tradition when taking the affirmative
position.


163
0:12:30,34 --> 0:12:33,82
William Lane Craig is Research Professor of
Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology in


164
0:12:33,82 --> 0:12:37,22
La Mirada, California.
He earned a Doctorate in Philosophy at the


165
0:12:37,22 --> 0:12:41,38
University of Birmingham England
before taking a Doctorate in Theology from


166
0:12:41,38 --> 0:12:46,12
Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in
Germany.


167
0:12:46,12 --> 0:12:51,9
Prior to his appointment at Talbot, he spent
several years at the Higher Institute of Philosophy


168
0:12:51,9 --> 0:12:57,82
of the Catholic University Louvain, Belgium.
He has authored and edited over 30 books including


169
0:12:57,82 --> 0:13:2,35
the Kalam Cosmological Argument,
Assessing the New Testament Evidence for the


170
0:13:2,35 --> 0:13:9,98
Historicity of the Resurrection of Jesus,
Theism, Atheism, and Big Bang Cosmology,


171
0:13:9,98 --> 0:13:14,22
and God, Time and Eternity,

172
0:13:14,22 --> 0:13:20,61

0:13:20,61 --> 0:13:25,4
Philosophical Studies, Philosophy, the British
Journal for Philosophy of Science.


174
0:13:25,4 --> 0:13:29,15
He is considered to be one of the foremost
defenders of the Christian faith.


175
0:13:29,15 --> 0:13:35,41
His book here, third edition, Reasonable Faith:
Christian Truth and Apologetics matches his


176
0:13:35,41 --> 0:13:46,27

Please welcome with me, Dr. Alex Rosenberg.


201
0:15:48,64 --> 0:15:54,44
(Audience clapping)


202
0:15:54,44 --> 0:16:7,18
Mr. Miller: The debate rules for tonight ...
the structure of the debate will be as follows:


203
0:16:7,18 --> 0:16:10,41
Each speaker will have a 20-minute opening
statement,


204
0:16:10,41 --> 0:16:15,47
followed by two 12-minute rebuttals and then
two eight-minute rebuttals.


205
0:16:15,47 --> 0:16:18,51
The speakers will then provide a five-minute
closing statement.


206
0:16:18,51 --> 0:16:21,76
Now, all the actual debate should take 90
minutes,


207
0:16:21,76 --> 0:16:25,1
45 minutes for each position to make their
case.


208
0:16:25,1 --> 0:16:30,529
There will then be a 30- to 45-minute Q&A
period according to which we will take questions


209
0:16:30,529 --> 0:16:35,73
from our live audience here at Purdue and
from our live streaming audience across the


210
0:16:35,73 --> 0:16:37,4
world perhaps.


211
0:16:37,4 --> 0:16:40,9
If either of the debaters goes over their
allotted time,


212
0:16:40,9 --> 0:16:44,99
we will give them a 15-second grace period
... we're very graceful ... gracious ...


213
0:16:44,99 --> 0:16:50,99
and then promptly ask them to terminate their
time and we will have a modest interaction


214
0:16:50,99 --> 0:16:58,7
between the professors in order to get a response
to maybe answers that they give to you.


215
0:16:58,7 --> 0:17:2,29
Professor Craig will approach the lectern
first.


216
0:17:2,29 --> 0:17:13,439
Dr. Craig ... and then when he begins, the
time begins. Timer, are you ready? Begin.


217
0:17:13,439 --> 0:17:19,89
Dr. Craig: Good evening, I'm delighted to
be able to participate in tonight's debate


218
0:17:19,89 --> 0:17:26,559
and I count it a real privilege to be discussing
this important issue with Dr. Rosenberg.


219
0:17:26,559 --> 0:17:33,7
Tonight, we're interested in discussing some
of the arguments that make belief in God reasonable


220
0:17:33,7 --> 0:17:37,77
or unreasonable.
So, in my opening speech, I'm going to present


221
0:17:37,77 --> 0:17:44,11
several arguments, which I think make it reasonable
to believe that God exists.


222
0:17:44,11 --> 0:17:50,12
In my second speech, I will respond to Dr.
Rosenberg's arguments against the reasonable


223
0:17:50,12 --> 0:17:56,37
disbelief in God.
I believe that God's existence best explains


224
0:17:56,37 --> 0:18:3,38
a wide range of the data of human experience.
Let me just mention eight.


225
0:18:3,38 --> 0:18:9,77
First, God is the best explanation of why
anything at all exists.


226
0:18:9,77 --> 0:18:15,1
Suppose you were hiking through the forest
and came upon a ball lying on the ground.


227
0:18:15,1 --> 0:18:18,64
You would naturally wonder how it came to
be there.


228
0:18:18,64 --> 0:18:24,96
If your hiking buddy said to you, "Just forget
about it, it just exists," inexplicably.


229
0:18:24,96 --> 0:18:29,66
You would think either that he was joking
or that he wanted you to just keep moving.


230
0:18:29,66 --> 0:18:36,85
No one would take seriously the idea that
the ball just exists without any explanation.


231
0:18:36,85 --> 0:18:43,59
Now, notice that merely increasing the size
of the ball even until it becomes coextensive


232
0:18:43,59 --> 0:18:52,23
with the universe does nothing to provide
or remove the need for an explanation of its


233
0:18:52,23 --> 0:18:53,8
existence.


234
0:18:53,8 --> 0:18:57,58
So, what is the explanation of the existence
of the universe?


235
0:18:57,58 --> 0:19:3,3
Whereby, the universe, I mean all of space-time
reality,


236
0:19:3,3 --> 0:19:9,4
the explanation of the universe can lie only
in a transcendent reality;


237
0:19:9,4 --> 0:19:16,809
beyond the universe, beyond space and time,
which is metaphysically necessary in its existence.


238
0:19:16,809 --> 0:19:22,69
Now, there's only one way I can think of to
get a contingent universe from a necessarily


239
0:19:22,69 --> 0:19:28,95
existing cause,
and that is if the cause is a personal agent


240
0:19:28,95 --> 0:19:34,6
who can freely choose to create a contingent
reality.


241
0:19:34,6 --> 0:19:39,62
It therefore follows that the best explanation
of the existence of the contingent universe


242
0:19:39,62 --> 0:19:47,79
is a transcendent personal being,
which is what everybody means by "God".


243
0:19:47,79 --> 0:19:50,37
We can summarize this reasoning as follows:


244
0:19:50,37 --> 0:19:55,14
One, every contingent thing has an explanation
of its existence.


245
0:19:55,14 --> 0:20:1,55
Two, if the universe has an explanation of
its existence, that explanation is a transcendent


246
0:20:1,55 --> 0:20:7,52
personal being.
Three, the universe is a contingent thing.


247
0:20:7,52 --> 0:20:12,54
Four, therefore the universe has an explanation
of its existence.


248
0:20:12,54 --> 0:20:19,64
Five, therefore the explanation of the universe
is a transcendent personal being; which is


249
0:20:19,64 --> 0:20:22,94
what everybody means by "God".


250
0:20:22,94 --> 0:20:29,28
Second, God is the best explanation of the
origin of the universe.


251
0:20:29,28 --> 0:20:35,66
We have pretty strong evidence that the universe
is not eternal in the past but had an absolute


252
0:20:35,66 --> 0:20:42,38
beginning a finite time ago.
In 2003, Arvind Borde, Alan Guth, and Alexander


253
0:20:42,38 --> 0:20:49,33
Vilenkin were able to prove that any universe
which has on average been in a state of cosmic


254
0:20:49,33 --> 0:20:54,19
expansion,
cannot be infinite in the past, but must have


255
0:20:54,19 --> 0:20:57,32
a past space time boundary.


256
0:20:57,32 --> 0:21:3,78
What makes their proof so powerful is that
it holds regardless of the physical description


257
0:21:3,78 --> 0:21:7,88
of the very early universe.
Because we don't yet have a quantum theory


258
0:21:7,88 --> 0:21:14,27
of gravity, we can't yet provide a physical
description of the first split second of the


259
0:21:14,27 --> 0:21:20,7
universe,
but the Borde-Guth Vilenkin theorem is independent


260
0:21:20,7 --> 0:21:23,42
of any physical description of that moment.


261
0:21:23,42 --> 0:21:29,46
Their theorem implies that the quantum vacuum
state, which may have characterized the early


262
0:21:29,46 --> 0:21:33,91
universe;
cannot be eternal in the past but must have


263
0:21:33,91 --> 0:21:39,89
had an absolute beginning.
Even if our universe is just a tiny part of


264
0:21:39,89 --> 0:21:46,49
a so-called multiverse composed of many universes,
their theorem requires that the multiverse


265
0:21:46,49 --> 0:21:51,38
itself must have had an absolute beginning.


266
0:21:51,38 --> 0:21:57,86
Of course, highly speculative scenarios, such
as loop quantum gravity models, string models,


267
0:21:57,86 --> 0:22:4,6
and even closed time-like curves
had been proposed to try to avoid this absolute


268
0:22:4,6 --> 0:22:9,25
beginning.
These models are fraught with problems, but


269
0:22:9,25 --> 0:22:17,57
the bottom line is that none of these models,
even if true,succeed in restoring an eternal


270
0:22:17,57 --> 0:22:21,52
past.
Last spring, at a conference in Cambridge


271
0:22:21,52 --> 0:22:28,37
celebrating the 70th birthday of Stephen Hawking,
Vilenkin delivered a paper entitled; Did the


272
0:22:28,37 --> 0:22:33,14
Universe Have a Beginning?,
which surveyed the current cosmology with


273
0:22:33,14 --> 0:22:35,2
respect to that question.


274
0:22:35,2 --> 0:22:42,24
He argued and I quote "None of these scenarios
can actually be past-eternal."


275
0:22:42,24 --> 0:22:48,5
He concluded, "All the evidence we have says
that the universe had a beginning."


276
0:22:48,5 --> 0:22:55,86
But then the inevitable question arises, why
did the universe come into being?


277
0:22:55,86 --> 0:23:2,309
What brought the universe into existence?
There must have been a transcendent cause


278
0:23:2,309 --> 0:23:5,54
which brought the universe into being.


279
0:23:5,54 --> 0:23:8,63
We can summarize our argument thus far as
follows:


280
0:23:8,63 --> 0:23:15,92
One, the universe began to exist.
Two, if the universe began to exist, then


281
0:23:15,92 --> 0:23:23,66
the universe has a transcendent cause.
Three, therefore the universe has a transcendent


282
0:23:23,66 --> 0:23:25,86
cause.


283
0:23:25,86 --> 0:23:34,3
By the very nature of the case, that cause
must be a transcendent immaterial being.


284
0:23:34,3 --> 0:23:38,71
There are only two possible things that could
fit that description,


285
0:23:38,71 --> 0:23:47,73
either an abstract object like a number or
an unembodied mind or consciousness,


286
0:23:47,73 --> 0:23:52,1
but abstract objects don't stand in causal
relations.


287
0:23:52,1 --> 0:23:55,91
The number seven for example has no effect
on anything.


288
0:23:55,91 --> 0:24:2,309
Therefore, the cause of the universe is plausibly
an unembodied mind or person.


289
0:24:2,309 --> 0:24:8,35
Thus we are brought not merely to a transcendent
cause of the universe, but to its personal


290
0:24:8,35 --> 0:24:10,549
creator.


291
0:24:10,549 --> 0:24:17,74
Three, God is the best explanation of the
applicability of mathematics to the physical


292
0:24:17,74 --> 0:24:21,96
world.
Philosophers and scientists have puzzled over


293
0:24:21,96 --> 0:24:29,16
what physicists Eugene Wigner called "The
uncanny effectiveness of mathematics."


294
0:24:29,16 --> 0:24:35,83
How is it that a mathematical theorist like
Peter Higgs, can sit down at his desk and


295
0:24:35,83 --> 0:24:42,46
by pouring over mathematical equations,
predict the existence of a fundamental particle


296
0:24:42,46 --> 0:24:49,13
which experimentalists 30 years later after
investing millions of dollars and thousands


297
0:24:49,13 --> 0:24:58,25
of man hours are finally able to detect.
Mathematics is the language of nature, but


298
0:24:58,25 --> 0:25:4,14
how is this to be explained?
If mathematical objects are abstract entities


299
0:25:4,14 --> 0:25:9,25
causally isolated from the universe,
then the applicability of mathematics is in


300
0:25:9,25 --> 0:25:15,16
the words of philosopher of mathematics Penelope
Maddy, "A happy coincidence."


301
0:25:15,16 --> 0:25:19,34
On the other hand,if mathematical objects
are just useful fictions,


302
0:25:19,34 --> 0:25:24,75
how is it that nature is written in the language
of these fictions?


303
0:25:24,75 --> 0:25:32,79
In his book, Dr. Rosenberg emphasizes that
naturalism doesn't tolerate cosmic coincidences,


304
0:25:32,79 --> 0:25:38,98
but the naturalist has no explanation of the
uncanny applicability of mathematics to the


305
0:25:38,98 --> 0:25:40,309
physical world.


306
0:25:40,309 --> 0:25:46,7
By contrast, the theist has a ready explanation.
When God created the physical universe, he


307
0:25:46,7 --> 0:25:51,88
designed it on the mathematical structure
he had in mind.


308
0:25:51,88 --> 0:25:57,929
We can summarize this argument as follows:
One, if God did not exist the applicability


309
0:25:57,929 --> 0:26:4,54
of mathematics would be a happy coincidence.
Two, the applicability of mathematics is not


310
0:26:4,54 --> 0:26:10,99
a happy coincidence.
Three, therefore God exists.


311
0:26:10,99 --> 0:26:17,559
Fourth, God is the best explanation of the
fine-tuning of the universe for intelligent


312
0:26:17,559 --> 0:26:19,2
life.


313
0:26:19,2 --> 0:26:24,1
In recent decades, scientists have been stunned
by the discovery that the initial conditions


314
0:26:24,1 --> 0:26:28,57
of the big bang
were fine tuned for the existence of intelligent


315
0:26:28,57 --> 0:26:35,75
life with a precision and delicacy that literally
defy human comprehension.


316
0:26:35,75 --> 0:26:43,16
There are three live explanatory options for
this extraordinary fine tuning;


317
0:26:43,16 --> 0:26:53,299
a physical necessity, chance, or design.
Physical necessity is not, however, a plausible


318
0:26:53,299 --> 0:26:59,95
explanation because the finely-tuned constants
and quantities are independent of the laws


319
0:26:59,95 --> 0:27:3,74
of nature.
Therefore they are not physically necessary.


320
0:27:3,74 --> 0:27:9,62
Could the fine-tuning be due to chance?
The problem with this explanation is that


321
0:27:9,62 --> 0:27:16,32
the odds of a life-permitting universe governed
by our laws of nature are just so infinitesimal


322
0:27:16,32 --> 0:27:21,37
that they cannot be reasonably faced.
Therefore the proponents of chance have been


323
0:27:21,37 --> 0:27:28,76
forced to postulate the existence of a world
ensemble of other universes,


324
0:27:28,76 --> 0:27:32,48
preferably infinite in number and randomly
ordered,


325
0:27:32,48 --> 0:27:39,46
so that life permitting universes would appear
by chance somewhere in the ensemble.


326
0:27:39,46 --> 0:27:46,919
Not only is this hypothesis to borrow Richard
Dawkins' phrase, "An unparsimonious extravagance",


327
0:27:46,919 --> 0:27:53,6
but it faces an insuperable objection.
By far, most of the observable universes in


328
0:27:53,6 --> 0:27:58,46
a world ensemble would be worlds in which
a single brain


329
0:27:58,46 --> 0:28:5,14
fluctuates into existence out of the vacuum
and observes its otherwise empty world.


330
0:28:5,14 --> 0:28:11,49
Thus, if our world were just a random member
of a world ensemble, we ought to be having


331
0:28:11,49 --> 0:28:16,86
observations like that.
Since we don't, that's strongly disconfirms


332
0:28:16,86 --> 0:28:24,4
the world ensemble hypothesis, so chance is
also not a good explanation.


333
0:28:24,4 --> 0:28:30,32
It follows that design is the best explanation
of the fine-tuning of the universe.


334
0:28:30,32 --> 0:28:37,38
Thus, the fine-tuning of the universe constitutes
evidence for a cosmic designer.


335
0:28:37,38 --> 0:28:45,919
Fifth, God is the best explanation of intentional
states of consciousness in the world.


336
0:28:45,919 --> 0:28:53,4
Philosophers are puzzled by states of intentionality.
Intentionality is the property of being about


337
0:28:53,4 --> 0:28:59,98
something or of something.
It signifies the object directedness of our


338
0:28:59,98 --> 0:29:4,29
thoughts.
For example, I can think about my summer vacation


339
0:29:4,29 --> 0:29:7,51
or I can think of my wife.


340
0:29:7,51 --> 0:29:15,7
No physical object has this sort of intentionality.
A chair, or a stone, or a glob of tissue like


341
0:29:15,7 --> 0:29:23,169
the brain is not about or of something else.
Only mental states or states of consciousness


342
0:29:23,169 --> 0:29:29,44
are about other things.
As a materialist, Dr. Rosenberg recognizes


343
0:29:29,44 --> 0:29:37,11
this fact and so concludes that on atheism,
there really are no intentional states.


344
0:29:37,11 --> 0:29:45,23
Dr. Rosenberg boldly claims that we never
really think about anything, but this seems


345
0:29:45,23 --> 0:29:46,59
incredible.


346
0:29:46,59 --> 0:29:51,59
Obviously, I am thinking about Dr. Rosenberg's
argument.


347
0:29:51,59 --> 0:29:56,24
This seems to me to be a reductio ad absurdum
of atheism.


348
0:29:56,24 --> 0:30:3,5
By contrast on theism, because God is a mind,
it's hardly surprising that there should be


349
0:30:3,5 --> 0:30:9,1
finite minds.
Thus, intentional states fit comfortably into


350
0:30:9,1 --> 0:30:13,22
a theistic world view.
So, we may argue,


351
0:30:13,22 --> 0:30:20,22
One, if God did not exist, intentional states
of consciousness would not exist.


352
0:30:20,22 --> 0:30:24,99
Two, but intentional states of consciousness
do exist.


353
0:30:24,99 --> 0:30:30,9
Three, therefore God exists.


354
0:30:30,9 --> 0:30:38,13
Number six, God is the best explanation of
objective moral values and duties in the world.


355
0:30:38,13 --> 0:30:45,1
In moral experience, we apprehend moral values
and duties which impose themselves as objectively


356
0:30:45,1 --> 0:30:51,9
binding and true.
For example, we all recognize that it's wrong


357
0:30:51,9 --> 0:30:58,419
to walk into an elementary school with an
automatic weapon and to shoot little boys


358
0:30:58,419 --> 0:31:2,16
and girls and their teachers.


359
0:31:2,16 --> 0:31:8,32
On a naturalistic view, however, there's nothing
really wrong with this.


360
0:31:8,32 --> 0:31:15,69
Moral values are just a subjective byproduct
of biological evolution and social conditioning.


361
0:31:15,69 --> 0:31:21,289
Dr. Rosenberg is brutally honest about the
implications of his atheism.


362
0:31:21,289 --> 0:31:29,549
He writes, "There is no such thing as morally
right or wrong. Individual human life is meaningless


363
0:31:29,549 --> 0:31:37,549
and without ultimate moral value. We need
to face the fact that nihilism is true".


364
0:31:37,549 --> 0:31:45,46
By contrast, the theist grounds objective
moral values in God and our moral duties in


365
0:31:45,46 --> 0:31:51,1
his commands.
The theist thus has the explanatory resources


366
0:31:51,1 --> 0:31:57,49
which the atheist lacks to ground objective
moral values and duties.


367
0:31:57,49 --> 0:32:2,13
Hence we may argue,
One, objective moral values and duties exist.


368
0:32:2,13 --> 0:32:8,27
Two, but if God did not exist, objective moral
values and duties would not exist.


369
0:32:8,27 --> 0:32:13,78
From which it follows, Three, therefore God
exists.


370
0:32:13,78 --> 0:32:21,61
Number seven, God is the best explanation
of the historical facts about Jesus of Nazareth.


371
0:32:21,61 --> 0:32:27,28
Historians have reached something of a consensus
that Jesus came on the scene with an unprecedented


372
0:32:27,28 --> 0:32:34,33
sense of divine authority, the authority to
stand and speak in God's place.


373
0:32:34,33 --> 0:32:37,89
He claimed that in himself the Kingdom of
God had come.


374
0:32:37,89 --> 0:32:44,49
As visible demonstrations of this fact, he
carried out a ministry of miracle working


375
0:32:44,49 --> 0:32:50,15
and exorcisms, but the supreme confirmation
of his claim was his resurrection from the


376
0:32:50,15 --> 0:32:51,22
dead.


377
0:32:51,22 --> 0:32:57,84
If Jesus did rise from the dead; then it would
seem that we have a divine miracle on our


378
0:32:57,84 --> 0:33:3,33
hands, and thus evidence for the existence
of God.


379
0:33:3,33 --> 0:33:7,82
I realize that most people probably think
that the resurrection of Jesus is something


380
0:33:7,82 --> 0:33:14,52
you just accept by faith or not,
but there are actually three facts recognized


381
0:33:14,52 --> 0:33:20,96
by the majority of historians today which
I believe are best explained by the resurrection


382
0:33:20,96 --> 0:33:22,61
of Jesus.


383
0:33:22,61 --> 0:33:29,919
Fact number one, on the Sunday after his crucifixion,
Jesus' tomb was found empty by a group of


384
0:33:29,919 --> 0:33:35,799
his women followers.
Two, on separate occasions, different individuals


385
0:33:35,799 --> 0:33:42,559
and groups of people saw appearances of Jesus
alive after his death.


386
0:33:42,559 --> 0:33:48,429
And three, the original disciples suddenly
came to believe in the resurrection of Jesus


387
0:33:48,429 --> 0:33:53,419
despite having every predisposition to the
contrary.


388
0:33:53,419 --> 0:33:59,96
The eminent British scholar, N.T. Wright,
near the end of his 800-page study of the


389
0:33:59,96 --> 0:34:3,27
historicity of Jesus' resurrection concludes
that


390
0:34:3,27 --> 0:34:9,6
the empty tomb and post mortem appearances
of Jesus have been established to such a high


391
0:34:9,6 --> 0:34:12,72
degree of historical probability as to be
and I quote


392
0:34:12,72 --> 0:34:21,6
"virtually certain" akin to the death of Caesar
Augustus in AD 17 or the fall of Jerusalem


393
0:34:21,6 --> 0:34:24,98
in AD 70.


394
0:34:24,98 --> 0:34:29,99
Naturalistic attempts to explain away these
three great facts like the disciples stole


395
0:34:29,99 --> 0:34:35,649
the body or Jesus wasn't really dead
have been universally rejected by contemporary


396
0:34:35,649 --> 0:34:40,119
scholarship.
The simple fact is that there just is no plausible


397
0:34:40,119 --> 0:34:45,58
naturalistic explanation of these facts.
Therefore, it seems to me the Christian is


398
0:34:45,58 --> 0:34:53,2
amply justified in believing that Jesus rose
from the dead and was who he claimed to be,


399
0:34:53,2 --> 0:34:59,33
but that entails that God exists.
Thus we have a good inductive argument to


400
0:34:59,33 --> 0:35:5,42
the existence of God based on the facts concerning
the resurrection of Jesus.


401
0:35:5,42 --> 0:35:12,359
Finally, number eight,
God can be personally known and experienced.


402
0:35:12,359 --> 0:35:18,29
This isn't really an argument for God's existence,
rather it's the claim that you can know that


403
0:35:18,29 --> 0:35:24,9
God exists wholly apart from arguments simply
by personally experiencing Him.


404
0:35:24,9 --> 0:35:29,15
Philosophers call beliefs likes this "Properly
basic beliefs."


405
0:35:29,15 --> 0:35:34,98
They are based on some other beliefs rather
they're part of the foundations of a person's


406
0:35:34,98 --> 0:35:36,91
system of beliefs.


407
0:35:36,91 --> 0:35:42,88
Other properly basic beliefs would be belief
in the reality of the past or the existence


408
0:35:42,88 --> 0:35:47,96
of the external world.
In the same way, belief in God is for those


409
0:35:47,96 --> 0:35:54,73
who seek him a properly basic belief grounded
in our experience of God.


410
0:35:54,73 --> 0:36:0,92
If this is so, then there's a danger that
arguments for God could actually distract


411
0:36:0,92 --> 0:36:7,619
our attention from God Himself.
The Bible promises, "Draw near to God and


412
0:36:7,619 --> 0:36:13,3
He will draw near to you."
We must not so concentrate on the external


413
0:36:13,3 --> 0:36:19,19
proofs that we fail to hear the inner voice
of God speaking to our own hearts.


414
0:36:19,19 --> 0:36:25,22
For those who listen, God becomes a personal
reality in their lives.


415
0:36:25,22 --> 0:36:31,349
In summary then, we've seen eight respects
in which God provides a better explanation


416
0:36:31,349 --> 0:36:35,79
of the world than naturalism.
God is the best explanation of why anything


417
0:36:35,79 --> 0:36:39,79
at all exists.
God is the best explanation of the origin


418
0:36:39,79 --> 0:36:43,4
of the universe.
God is the best explanation of the applicability


419
0:36:43,4 --> 0:36:48,77
of mathematics to the physical world.
God is the best explanation of the fine-tuning


420
0:36:48,77 --> 0:36:53,5
of the universe for intelligent life.
God is the best explanation of intentional


421
0:36:53,5 --> 0:36:58,58
states of consciousness in the world.
God is the best explanation of objective moral


422
0:36:58,58 --> 0:37:3,17
values and duties in the world.
God is the best explanation of the historical


423
0:37:3,17 --> 0:37:10,4
facts concerning Jesus resurrection.
Finally, God can be personally known and experienced.


424
0:37:10,4 --> 0:37:16,32
For all of these reasons, I think that belief
in God is eminently reasonable.


425
0:37:16,32 --> 0:37:22,119
If Dr. Rosenberg is to persuade this otherwise,
he must first tear down all eight of the reasons


426
0:37:22,119 --> 0:37:25,97
that I've presented
and then in their place erect a case of his


427
0:37:25,97 --> 0:37:32,99
own to show why belief in God is unreasonable.
Unless and until he does that, I think we


428
0:37:32,99 --> 0:37:38,7
should agree that it is reasonable to believe
in God.


429
0:37:38,7 --> 0:37:43,32
(Audience clapping).


430
0:37:43,32 --> 0:37:57,33
Mr. Miller: Do we have a timer on this side
or is it just ... okay, that ends Dr. Craig's


431
0:37:57,33 --> 0:38:2,19
opening statement.
Dr. Rosenberg will now approach his lectern.


432
0:38:2,19 --> 0:38:8,41
And, when I say begin then Professor Rosenberg
may begin his 20-minute opening statement.


433
0:38:8,41 --> 0:38:12,25
Timer, are you ready?
Dr. Rosenberg you may begin.


434
0:38:12,25 --> 0:38:17,59
Dr. Rosenberg: Thanks Corey and thank you
for the invitation.


435
0:38:17,59 --> 0:38:22,97
As Yogi Berra of the famous Yankee catcher,
once said, "I appreciate you're making this


436
0:38:22,97 --> 0:38:28,5
night necessary."
I don't know whether to laugh or to cry.


437
0:38:28,5 --> 0:38:33,7
I hope you didn't pay money to come to tonight's
debate because everything that Dr. Craig said


438
0:38:33,7 --> 0:38:40,41
... almost everything actually, he said many
times before in many different debates, almost


439
0:38:40,41 --> 0:38:45,54
in the same order, and all of them available
on the internet.


440
0:38:45,54 --> 0:38:51,9
So, you know you didn't need to come out in
this really cold night here in West Lafayette


441
0:38:51,9 --> 0:38:55,63
to hear these debates again and to hear these
arguments again.


442
0:38:55,63 --> 0:39:0,369
In particular, what's remarkable about them
is how impervious they are to the previous


443
0:39:0,369 --> 0:39:4,57
discussions and criticism that they've been
exposed to.


444
0:39:4,57 --> 0:39:12,2
They're exactly the same as seven or eight
or nine internet presentations of his arguments


445
0:39:12,2 --> 0:39:17,39
in the past.
What it leads me to ask is, is Dr. Craig infallible


446
0:39:17,39 --> 0:39:19,46
or does he just not listen?


447
0:39:19,46 --> 0:39:27,51
Probably, the latter. He probably doesn't
listen to what his interlocutors have suggested.


448
0:39:27,51 --> 0:39:31,96
I don't think that he listens because he's
really not interested in getting at the truth.


449
0:39:31,96 --> 0:39:37,66
He's interested in scoring debate points.
The two moves that Dr. Craig almost always


450
0:39:37,66 --> 0:39:43,49
makes, first, there's the burden of proof
claim.


451
0:39:43,49 --> 0:39:48,2
As though we were in a court of law, as though
it was a question of the defending attorney


452
0:39:48,2 --> 0:39:53,31
and the prosecuting attorney engaged in an
adversarial procedure.


453
0:39:53,31 --> 0:39:58,28
And the other thing that you often hear is,
"All I need to show to win is ..." so for


454
0:39:58,28 --> 0:40:2,359
example at the very end of his remarks he
said, "I've got eight arguments and he's got


455
0:40:2,359 --> 0:40:8,92
to refute all eight of them or else I win".
You know, philosophy and theology don't proceed


456
0:40:8,92 --> 0:40:13,369
by a "court room style" debate.
We're engaged in a cooperative search for


457
0:40:13,369 --> 0:40:20,81
the truth, both theists and atheists, not
on adversarial contest for victory.


458
0:40:20,81 --> 0:40:27,78
This is the wrong format for a profitable
discussion of faith, or God, or science and


459
0:40:27,78 --> 0:40:33,79
reason.
But, let's turn to the substance of the matter.


460
0:40:33,79 --> 0:40:39,599
Our topic is whether faith in God is reasonable,
but of course by definition faith is a belief


461
0:40:39,599 --> 0:40:44,29
in the absence of evidence.
So, I'm going to give Dr. Craig the benefit


462
0:40:44,29 --> 0:40:50,2
of the doubt and accept the change that he
has made in the terms of the debate.


463
0:40:50,2 --> 0:40:54,53
It now turns out that what we're arguing about
is whether belief in God is reasonable.


464
0:40:54,53 --> 0:40:59,89
The god we're talking about is the god of
the Abrahamic religions; the god of Islam,


465
0:40:59,89 --> 0:41:4,6
of Christianity, and Judaism.
It's not the "milk and water" deism of for


466
0:41:4,6 --> 0:41:10,14
example the founding fathers, Jefferson, Adams,
Monroe perhaps even George Washington.


467
0:41:10,14 --> 0:41:13,21
The god we're talking about has the following
features.


468
0:41:13,21 --> 0:41:16,58
If he exists, he's got the three "omni's"
and benevolence.


469
0:41:16,58 --> 0:41:23,8
He's got omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence,
and an unqualifiedly goodwill.


470
0:41:23,8 --> 0:41:30,45
If these four features are incompatible with
some obvious fact, then of course the atheist's


471
0:41:30,45 --> 0:41:37,49
... the theist's god is non-existent.
Can I ask some water, Corey?


472
0:41:37,49 --> 0:41:44,26
So, let's be clear that we're arguing about
theism here.


473
0:41:44,26 --> 0:41:52,58
In thinking about theism and in thinking about
science ... thank you Corey ... there's something


474
0:41:52,58 --> 0:41:59,23
else that we had better keep in mind.
Dr. Craig is very confident about his take


475
0:41:59,23 --> 0:42:7,58
on fundamental physics, on important and controversial
questions about which physicists have not


476
0:42:7,58 --> 0:42:9,44
attain consensus.


477
0:42:9,44 --> 0:42:14,349
The important thing to bear in mind in thinking
about his take, the sides he chose, and the


478
0:42:14,349 --> 0:42:20,28
confidence with which he presents his take,
the important thing to bear in mind is this;


479
0:42:20,28 --> 0:42:23,69
there are 2,000 members of the National Academy
of Sciences.


480
0:42:23,69 --> 0:42:28,29
The most important body of the most distinguished
scientists in the United States of which four


481
0:42:28,29 --> 0:42:33,33
are faculty here at Purdue and two ... the
two Nobel Prize winners in chemistry of course


482
0:42:33,33 --> 0:42:36,39
are both members of the National Academy of
Science.


483
0:42:36,39 --> 0:42:42,859
Of these 2,000 people, 95% of them are atheists.
The percentage for the physicists is even


484
0:42:42,859 --> 0:42:46,48
higher.
What do these people know about physics that


485
0:42:46,48 --> 0:42:50,83
Dr. Craig doesn't know?
Is it a coincidence that this number of the


486
0:42:50,83 --> 0:42:55,22
members of the National Academy of Science
are unbelievers?


487
0:42:55,22 --> 0:43:2,91
I think it isn't and I think it requires us
to take with a certain lack of confidence,


488
0:43:2,91 --> 0:43:6,1
the claims that Dr. Craig makes about science.


489
0:43:6,1 --> 0:43:9,2
I'm going to controvert some of those claims
right now.


490
0:43:9,2 --> 0:43:13,33
In particular, many of the arguments that
Dr. Craig gave tonight, and which he has given


491
0:43:13,33 --> 0:43:18,599
repeatedly in the past, rest on the first
cause argument;


492
0:43:18,599 --> 0:43:26,51
an argument that goes back certainly to St.
Thomas Aquinas and probably to Aristotle.


493
0:43:26,51 --> 0:43:32,57
It rests on, of course, the principle of sufficient
reason; the principle that everything that


494
0:43:32,57 --> 0:43:35,859
exists must have a cause.


495
0:43:35,859 --> 0:43:40,619
The remarkable thing about this argument and
the Principle of Sufficient Reason as it's


496
0:43:40,619 --> 0:43:45,28
called on which address is that the principle
is plainly false.


497
0:43:45,28 --> 0:43:50,8
It's refuted trillions of times every second
throughout the universe.


498
0:43:50,8 --> 0:43:55,83
It's refuted in this room and I'll give you
a pretty full explanation of why.


499
0:43:55,83 --> 0:44:1,53
Take two Uranium 238 atoms, okay, that are
absolutely indistinguishable.


500
0:44:1,53 --> 0:44:7,14
In a given moment, these two indistinguishable
atoms, atoms of exactly the same mass and


501
0:44:7,14 --> 0:44:12,96
energy state have the following difference.
One produces an alpha particle spontaneously


502
0:44:12,96 --> 0:44:18,369
and the other doesn't.
There is no cause whatsoever for that difference.


503
0:44:18,369 --> 0:44:23,5
That's what quantum mechanics tells us.
Suddenly one emits an alpha particle and the


504
0:44:23,5 --> 0:44:26,63
other doesn't.
There's no cause or whatever for that difference


505
0:44:26,63 --> 0:44:27,589
between them.


506
0:44:27,589 --> 0:44:33,63
Now, you might think that that's not a very
important fact of nature but one mole, one


507
0:44:33,63 --> 0:44:44,58
Avogadro's number of Uranium 238 molecules,
emits three million alpha particles a second.


508
0:44:44,58 --> 0:44:49,78
Every helium atom on this planet is one of
those alpha particles.


509
0:44:49,78 --> 0:44:56,91
The smoke detectors that operate all through
this auditorium to protect us from fires,


510
0:44:56,91 --> 0:45:4,3
those operate because of the indeterminate,
unexplained, completely spontaneous appearance


511
0:45:4,3 --> 0:45:9,8
of an alpha particle out of a uranium atom
in these systems.


512
0:45:9,8 --> 0:45:18,55
For Dr. Craig to insist on the arguments that
rest on the claim, that every event had a


513
0:45:18,55 --> 0:45:24,93
cause that had to have brought it into being
is just bluff.


514
0:45:24,93 --> 0:45:30,97
Right, it's not a principle accepted in physics.
You can't argue from it, forward for ... from


515
0:45:30,97 --> 0:45:38,68
its intuitive attractiveness.
Let's consider the fine-tuning argument, another


516
0:45:38,68 --> 0:45:42,119
of the claims about science that Dr. Craig
makes.


517
0:45:42,119 --> 0:45:46,7
This is the argument that the charge on the
electron, the gravitational constant, the


518
0:45:46,7 --> 0:45:52,65
mass of the electron, Planck's constant, the
Hubble constant, the cosmic density parameter


519
0:45:52,65 --> 0:45:59,82
that they're all so beautifully arranged to
make human life actual that there must have


520
0:45:59,82 --> 0:46:4,369
been some purpose or design that brought them
into being in order to do that.


521
0:46:4,369 --> 0:46:6,32
That's the best explanation.


522
0:46:6,32 --> 0:46:12,359
To begin with, this is terrible carbon chauvinism.
If these constants had been slightly different,


523
0:46:12,359 --> 0:46:18,5
maybe there would be intelligent life in the
universe that's germanium-based or silicon-based.


524
0:46:18,5 --> 0:46:24,48
Look at the periodic table of the elements.
Look at the atoms around carbon in the periodic


525
0:46:24,48 --> 0:46:27,849
table.
Ask yourself whether, if some of these constants


526
0:46:27,849 --> 0:46:32,39
had been slightly different whether there
might not be intelligent creatures in the


527
0:46:32,39 --> 0:46:35,9
universe that are differently composed from
us.


528
0:46:35,9 --> 0:46:40,94
More important, physics ruled out the kind
of teleology, the kind of purpose of thinking


529
0:46:40,94 --> 0:46:47,54
that Dr. Craig invokes here, 400 years ago.
If it's one thing that physics is not going


530
0:46:47,54 --> 0:46:54,64
to go back to and turn around and accept in
its search for the fundamental nature of reality,


531
0:46:54,64 --> 0:46:57,95
it's the invocation of purposes.


532
0:46:57,95 --> 0:47:3,83
There are of course in physical theory at
least two different ways in which the particular


533
0:47:3,83 --> 0:47:10,66
way in which the constants of our part of
the universe could have come in to existence,


534
0:47:10,66 --> 0:47:15,45
while they're being in a definitely large
number of other combinations of constants,


535
0:47:15,45 --> 0:47:21,74
making up other inaccessible regions either
of this universe or of other universes.


536
0:47:21,74 --> 0:47:29,49
The inflationary period soon after the big
bang produced regions of space by completely


537
0:47:29,49 --> 0:47:35,79
quantum mechanical indeterministic symmetry
breaking which are inaccessible to us; which


538
0:47:35,79 --> 0:47:46,24
are beyond our horizon, our event horizon.
There are possibly indefinitely many of these.


539
0:47:46,24 --> 0:47:49,3
For all we know, there may be life or there
may not be life in them.


540
0:47:49,3 --> 0:47:57,16
Then of course string theory and end theory
tell us that there are minimally 10 to the


541
0:47:57,16 --> 0:48:4,64
500th different kinds of possible universes
or actual universes bubbling up out of the


542
0:48:4,64 --> 0:48:12,25
quantum foam of the eternally existing, multi-universe.


543
0:48:12,25 --> 0:48:17,75
I'm not going to take sides on these varying
theories, but I defy Professor Craig to argue


544
0:48:17,75 --> 0:48:24,51
from authority that it is impossible for something
to have been created from nothing.


545
0:48:24,51 --> 0:48:29,98
The symmetry breaking which is characteristic
of the cascade of events that occurred in


546
0:48:29,98 --> 0:48:37,6
our universe and which produces our universe
in addition to the indefinitely many other


547
0:48:37,6 --> 0:48:40,73
universes bubbling up out of the quantum foam
of the multiverse.


548
0:48:40,73 --> 0:48:45,46
That symmetry breaking is another example
of the violation of the principle of sufficient


549
0:48:45,46 --> 0:48:50,6
reason on which Dr. Craig's stakes so many
of his arguments.


550
0:48:50,6 --> 0:48:53,609
Let's turn to something much more accessible,
objective values.


551
0:48:53,609 --> 0:49:0,52
Now, Dr. Craig's argument that only God can
underwrite objective values was refuted by


552
0:49:0,52 --> 0:49:8,599
Plato in 390 B.C., in an argument that he
gives in the first and simplest of his dialogues


553
0:49:8,599 --> 0:49:9,78
the Euthyphro.


554
0:49:9,78 --> 0:49:15,67
I'm very tempted to say to Dr. Craig, "What
part of 'No Euthyphro' don't you understand?"


555
0:49:15,67 --> 0:49:20,92
The question that Plato raises in the Euthyphro
goes like this, "Take your favorite moral


556
0:49:20,92 --> 0:49:26,95
norm; gay marriage is forbidden, or FGM is
required, or thou shall not kill.


557
0:49:26,95 --> 0:49:30,5
Take your favorite moral norm.
Ask yourself this question.


558
0:49:30,5 --> 0:49:36,17
Is it morally right because God chose it or
did God choose it because it's morally right?"


559
0:49:36,17 --> 0:49:40,54
We all know the answer to this question.
The answer to this question is God chose it


560
0:49:40,54 --> 0:49:45,7
because it's morally right.
What that means of course is the moral rightness


561
0:49:45,7 --> 0:49:51,96
of thou shall not kill is entirely independent
fact from God's choosing it, it's because


562
0:49:51,96 --> 0:49:59,98
he recognizes the moral rightness of "Thou
shall not kill" that he imposed it on us.


563
0:49:59,98 --> 0:50:4,579
That means that the mere fact that it's God
who imposed it on us, doesn't explain the


564
0:50:4,579 --> 0:50:5,98
nature of objective value.


565
0:50:5,98 --> 0:50:11,92
It's that further fact that he was wise enough
and smart enough to detect about "Thou shall


566
0:50:11,92 --> 0:50:16,43
not kill" that made it the morally right value
for us.


567
0:50:16,43 --> 0:50:22,97
Okay and this is the point that Socrates makes
to Euthyphro in the first and simplest of


568
0:50:22,97 --> 0:50:32,13
the dialogues.
And it is a problem that theological ethics


569
0:50:32,13 --> 0:50:38,18
has wrestled with ever since.
The only option in responding to this argument


570
0:50:38,18 --> 0:50:44,15
is the divine command theory; a theory that
has had its exponents all the way back to


571
0:50:44,15 --> 0:50:45,52
William of Ockham.


572
0:50:45,52 --> 0:50:51,38
The trouble with divine command theory is
that in order to articulate that theory, in


573
0:50:51,38 --> 0:50:57,25
order to defend it, in order to make it sound
plausible; you have to already commit yourself


574
0:50:57,25 --> 0:51:3,4
to there being some normative fact, some moral
fact about the moral rules that make them


575
0:51:3,4 --> 0:51:8,57
right independent of God's saying, "You do
it or you go to hell".


576
0:51:8,57 --> 0:51:14,43
There's a rightness about moral norms that
cannot be exhausted by the mere fact that


577
0:51:14,43 --> 0:51:20,7
it was handed down on a mountain by Moses
from God.


578
0:51:20,7 --> 0:51:28,69
Natural selection is a theory of course about
how we came to be moral, why we're moral about


579
0:51:28,69 --> 0:51:32,76
what the ecological conditions are that made
us moral.


580
0:51:32,76 --> 0:51:38,579
It explains our morality, but it doesn't necessarily
explain away our morality.


581
0:51:38,579 --> 0:51:45,56
That requires something else.
The suggestion that without God, the naturalist,


582
0:51:45,56 --> 0:51:54,44
the Darwinian has no basis on which to underwrite
his normative commitment that again is bluff.


583
0:51:54,44 --> 0:52:4,43
And in fact, it's the person who claims that
it's God that gave normative morality to us,


584
0:52:4,43 --> 0:52:12,91
that explains its normative rightness is the
person who has regrettably to use the expression


585
0:52:12,91 --> 0:52:16,63
that Dr. Craig so invokes the burden of proof
of explaining.


586
0:52:16,63 --> 0:52:24,329
What is it about God that makes for the moral
rightness of the ethical norms that he imposes


587
0:52:24,329 --> 0:52:26,48
on us?


588
0:52:26,48 --> 0:52:33,22
There are of course any numbers of alternative
ethical theories that underwrite the objectivity


589
0:52:33,22 --> 0:52:39,1
of ethics; among them, utilitarianism and
social contract theory, and ideal observer


590
0:52:39,1 --> 0:52:44,609
theory, and Hume's theory of the sympathies
and the Kantian theory of the categorical


591
0:52:44,609 --> 0:52:48,94
imperative.
And the real problem for Dr. Craig is he needs


592
0:52:48,94 --> 0:52:53,97
to refute each of these normative theories
in order to show that there's no other basis


593
0:52:53,97 --> 0:53:0,55
for ethics than God.
The resources that he would use to cast doubt


594
0:53:0,55 --> 0:53:7,109
on these theories also cast out on the divine
command theory.


595
0:53:7,109 --> 0:53:13,97
So, let's turn to the argument from the New
Testament.


596
0:53:13,97 --> 0:53:19,71
I am sort of gob-smacked as a philosopher
that he should persist in propounding this


597
0:53:19,71 --> 0:53:25,4
preposterous argument.
Ask yourself the following question, in 1827


598
0:53:25,4 --> 0:53:33,98
Joseph Smith got 11 people to certify that
they observe the golden tablets which he,


599
0:53:33,98 --> 0:53:45,64
an illiterate person, was able to translate
from reformed Egyptian and convey the Book


600
0:53:45,64 --> 0:53:51,29
of Mormon to the Mormon ...
to the Latter Day Saints.


601
0:53:51,29 --> 0:54:0,1
Do we believe on the basis of those 11 certificates
that are only about 160 years old that the


602
0:54:0,1 --> 0:54:7,72
Book of Mormon is the revealed word of God?
The Koran tells us that Muhammad ascended


603
0:54:7,72 --> 0:54:16,74
to heaven from the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the Dome
of the Rock in Jerusalem on the 26th of February


604
0:54:16,74 --> 0:54:19,96
621.
And there are millions and millions of Muslims


605
0:54:19,96 --> 0:54:24,79
all over the world who are committed to that
great truth.


606
0:54:24,79 --> 0:54:28,579
Do you think we in this room should believe
it? Right.


607
0:54:28,579 --> 0:54:34,95
Scientology that claims eight million adherents
throughout the world, Scientology tells us


608
0:54:34,95 --> 0:54:43,19
that 75 million years ago somebody named Xenu
brought billions of people to earth on spaceships


609
0:54:43,19 --> 0:54:48,72
that looked like DC8s.
And who are we to believe that there are 55,000


610
0:54:48,72 --> 0:54:52,24
people in the United States or eight million
people around the world who really believe


611
0:54:52,24 --> 0:54:57,29
this too? Is there any reason why we should
accept the certification of L.


612
0:54:57,29 --> 0:55:4,79
Ron Hubbard and the Church of Scientology
that this actually happened? No, of course


613
0:55:4,79 --> 0:55:4,56
not.


614
0:55:4,56 --> 0:55:9,74
How many of you are familiar with the statues
of Madonna taken out from their churches once


615
0:55:9,74 --> 0:55:16,329
a year which shed tears? Of course as scientist
we know exactly what the physical properties


616
0:55:16,329 --> 0:55:21,72
are of these statues and how the rapid and
sudden change of temperature between the inside


617
0:55:21,72 --> 0:55:26,13
and the outside of the cathedral produces
condensation, which the devout believed to


618
0:55:26,13 --> 0:55:29,14
be tears, but that's no reason for us to believe
it.


619
0:55:29,14 --> 0:55:38,869
Think about this, 53 of the first 62 DNA exonerations
of people who turned out to be innocent of


620
0:55:38,869 --> 0:55:44,329
charges of capital crimes in the United States,
53 of these people were committed, convicted


621
0:55:44,329 --> 0:55:51,47
on eye witness testimony.
We know from cognitive social science how


622
0:55:51,47 --> 0:55:58,0
unreliable eye witness testimony is today.
Why should we suppose the eye witness testimony


623
0:55:58,0 --> 0:56:2,39
from 33 A.D.
is any more reliable?


624
0:56:2,39 --> 0:56:7,28
This as an argument for God's existence seems
to me to be bizarre.


625
0:56:7,28 --> 0:56:12,71
Of course the killer argument for...
against God's existence is the argument from


626
0:56:12,71 --> 0:56:17,13
evil.
It's enough to show that theism is unreasonable


627
0:56:17,13 --> 0:56:22,18
and it of course is the principle reason for
apostasy from the Christian faith and the


628
0:56:22,18 --> 0:56:25,53
Jewish faith and Islam, all through the centuries.


629
0:56:25,53 --> 0:56:31,38
And the argument is simple and terrible and
it goes like this: One, if the theist God


630
0:56:31,38 --> 0:56:38,89
exists, he's omnipotent and benevolent.
A benevolent creature eliminates suffering


631
0:56:38,89 --> 0:56:42,97
to the extent that the benevolent creature
can.


632
0:56:42,97 --> 0:56:48,89
Therefore, if there's a god and he's omnipotent
and benevolent, he eliminates all suffering,


633
0:56:48,89 --> 0:56:54,54
but as we know it's obvious that there's plenty
of suffering in the world both man-made and


634
0:56:54,54 --> 0:56:56,99
natural suffering.


635
0:56:56,99 --> 0:57:4,349
If there's a god then he is either not omnipotent,
or not benevolent, or not either omnipotent


636
0:57:4,349 --> 0:57:10,41
or benevolent and theism is false.
The problem of evil is theism's problem from


637
0:57:10,41 --> 0:57:14,15
hell.
I want to say one last thing about the problem


638
0:57:14,15 --> 0:57:19,17
of evil and about the potential responses
that Dr. Craig will make and that he has made


639
0:57:19,17 --> 0:57:22,49
in the past.
And I need to make something about my own


640
0:57:22,49 --> 0:57:24,359
personal history clear here.


641
0:57:24,359 --> 0:57:29,39
There are a lot of responses to the problem
of evil that I find morally offensive.


642
0:57:29,39 --> 0:57:32,0
I find them morally offensive for a certain
reason.


643
0:57:32,0 --> 0:57:37,72
I'm the child of holocaust survivors.
All of my family, except my parents, were


644
0:57:37,72 --> 0:57:42,319
killed by the Nazis, including two half brothers
of mine.


645
0:57:42,319 --> 0:57:43,14
Okay?


646
0:57:43,14 --> 0:57:50,15
I will not take kindly, okay, to a suggestion
that Dr. Craig has made repeatedly in debate


647
0:57:50,15 --> 0:57:56,39
for or like this, that the innocent children
who died in the holocaust including, or died


648
0:57:56,39 --> 0:57:58,75
in the hands of Israeli ...
of the children ...


649
0:57:58,75 --> 0:58:5,2
of the soldiers of Israel in Canaan; that
these innocent children like my half brothers


650
0:58:5,2 --> 0:58:11,0
were more fortunate, more luckier because
they ascended to heaven directly than the


651
0:58:11,0 --> 0:58:16,88
SS soldiers who killed them and lived very
nice, very comfortable, very long lives in


652
0:58:16,88 --> 0:58:19,5
West Germany after World War II.


653
0:58:19,5 --> 0:58:26,349
I'm not going to take kindly to that kind
of exculpation of theism.


654
0:58:26,349 --> 0:58:31,73
In particular, Dr. Craig has said before,
and said in one sentence at least tonight;


655
0:58:31,73 --> 0:58:39,4
that nobody has ever shown the incompatibility
of theism and suffering that it's part of


656
0:58:39,4 --> 0:58:45,119
divine plan that's beyond our cognizance.
Well, the argument that I sketched, the argument


657
0:58:45,119 --> 0:58:51,54
from the evil is a logical deduction which
shows the incompatibility of an omnipotent


658
0:58:51,54 --> 0:58:56,56
and benevolent creature with suffering on
this planet.


659
0:58:56,56 --> 0:59:7,13
And it's not enough to "fob it off" on the
mystery of God's plan or on the mere logical


660
0:59:7,13 --> 0:59:12,69
compatibility of these two views.
Now, I've got to stop and in the reply I'm


661
0:59:12,69 --> 0:59:17,31
going to want to take up the two new arguments
that Dr. Craig introduced; the argument from


662
0:59:17,31 --> 0:59:23,47
mathematics and the argument from intentionality,
but I think I put enough on the table for


663
0:59:23,47 --> 0:59:28,44
him to rejoin.
Thank you.


664
0:59:28,44 --> 0:59:31,25
(Audience clapping)


665
0:59:31,25 --> 0:59:41,98
Dr. Miller: All right Dr. Craig will now begin
his 12-minute rebuttal.


666
0:59:41,98 --> 0:59:46,21
Timer, go ahead and begin when he begins to
speak.


667
0:59:46,21 --> 0:59:55,18
Dr. Craig: I noticed that in Dr. Rosenberg's
opening speech, he didn't really present many


668
0:59:55,18 --> 0:59:59,1
arguments against the reasonableness of belief
in God.


669
0:59:59,1 --> 1:0:4,29
He gestured in the direction of the problem
of evil, but he didn't really develop it.


670
1:0:4,29 --> 1:0:9,319
The problem is that argument is based upon
controversial premises such as that if God


671
1:0:9,319 --> 1:0:15,22
is all powerful, he can just create any world
that He wants and that If God is all good,


672
1:0:15,22 --> 1:0:20,6
he would want to create a world without evil.
And neither one of those is necessarily true


673
1:0:20,6 --> 1:0:25,48
and that is why among philosophers even atheists,
the logical version of the problem of evil


674
1:0:25,48 --> 1:0:26,81
is widely rejected.


675
1:0:26,81 --> 1:0:32,49
So, what Dr. Rosenberg needs to show, is that
it is impossible that God could have morally


676
1:0:32,49 --> 1:0:37,599
sufficient reasons for permitting the suffering
in the world and until he does that he hasn't


677
1:0:37,599 --> 1:0:42,38
even begun to offer a problem of evil that
disproves theism.


678
1:0:42,38 --> 1:0:47,619
Rather when you read Dr. Rosenberg's work,
what you discover is that his skepticism about


679
1:0:47,619 --> 1:0:53,93
God's existence is really rooted in his scientism
or naturalism, which make it unreasonable


680
1:0:53,93 --> 1:0:55,23
to believe in God.


681
1:0:55,23 --> 1:1:1,1
But here I think it's absolutely crucial that
we distinguish between two types of naturalism


682
1:1:1,1 --> 1:1:7,93
that Dr. Rosenberg tends to blur together,
epistemological naturalism which says that


683
1:1:7,93 --> 1:1:13,369
science is the only source of knowledge and
metaphysical naturalism, which says that only


684
1:1:13,369 --> 1:1:18,76
physical things exist.
Let me say a word about each one of these.


685
1:1:18,76 --> 1:1:24,89
First, with respect to epistemological naturalism,
I want to make two points.


686
1:1:24,89 --> 1:1:28,71
First, it's a false theory of knowledge for
two reasons.


687
1:1:28,71 --> 1:1:34,46
First, it's overly restrictive.
There are truths that cannot be proven by


688
1:1:34,46 --> 1:1:40,52
natural science and the success of natural
science in discovering truths about the physical


689
1:1:40,52 --> 1:1:46,859
world does nothing to show that it's the only
source of knowledge and truth.


690
1:1:46,859 --> 1:1:52,26
Secondly, it's self refuting.
The statement, natural science is the only


691
1:1:52,26 --> 1:1:57,19
source of knowledge, is not itself a scientific
statement.


692
1:1:57,19 --> 1:2:2,95
Therefore it cannot be true.
For these two reasons, epistemological naturalism


693
1:2:2,95 --> 1:2:9,559
is a false theory of knowledge that is widely
rejected by philosophers but leave that point


694
1:2:9,559 --> 1:2:12,42
aside.
The really important point for tonight's debate


695
1:2:12,42 --> 1:2:13,599
is the second.


696
1:2:13,599 --> 1:2:19,609
That epistemological naturalism does not imply
metaphysical naturalism.


697
1:2:19,609 --> 1:2:24,819
A case in point would be Willard Quine, the
most famous epistemological naturalist of


698
1:2:24,819 --> 1:2:29,93
the 20th century.
Quine showed himself to be commendably open


699
1:2:29,93 --> 1:2:36,819
to the reality of non-physical entities.
He wrote, "If I saw indirect explanatory benefit


700
1:2:36,819 --> 1:2:44,97
in positing, possibilia, spirits, a Creator,
I would joyfully accord them scientific status


701
1:2:44,97 --> 1:2:52,16
too on a par with such avowedly scientific
posits as quarks and black holes."


702
1:2:52,16 --> 1:2:58,79
And in fact, Quine was as good as his word,
for he did posit the existence of immaterial,


703
1:2:58,79 --> 1:3:4,42
non-physical objects namely mathematical objects
like sets.


704
1:3:4,42 --> 1:3:12,48
Quine's case shows that the epistemological
naturalist need not be a metaphysical naturalist;


705
1:3:12,48 --> 1:3:15,51
but secondly my arguments for the existence
of God.


706
1:3:15,51 --> 1:3:21,93
Many of my arguments do just what Quine said.
They show on the basis of scientific evidence


707
1:3:21,93 --> 1:3:30,2
the explanatory benefit of positing God.
And so, they are acceptable to the epistemological


708
1:3:30,2 --> 1:3:30,839
naturalist.


709
1:3:30,839 --> 1:3:36,55
The epistemological naturalist can and I think
should be a theist.


710
1:3:36,55 --> 1:3:42,2
The real issue in the debate tonight is not
epistemological but metaphysical naturalism.


711
1:3:42,2 --> 1:3:49,119
Dr. Rosenberg hasn't given us any reason to
think that metaphysical naturalism is true.


712
1:3:49,119 --> 1:3:54,49
So, what can we say about metaphysical naturalism?
Again I want to make two points.


713
1:3:54,49 --> 1:4:0,17
First, my arguments for the existence of God
showed that metaphysical naturalism is not


714
1:4:0,17 --> 1:4:5,19
true.
There is a personal transcendent reality beyond


715
1:4:5,19 --> 1:4:12,45
the physical universe; but secondly I think
that metaphysical naturalism is so contrary


716
1:4:12,45 --> 1:4:18,49
to reason and experience as to be absurd.
And in the following arguments, the first


717
1:4:18,49 --> 1:4:28,13
premise in every case is taken from Dr. Rosenberg's
own book, so first the argument from intentionality.


718
1:4:28,13 --> 1:4:35,579
According to Dr. Rosenberg if naturalism is
true; I cannot think about anything, that's


719
1:4:35,579 --> 1:4:42,5
because there are no intentional states, but
two, I am thinking about naturalism from which


720
1:4:42,5 --> 1:4:46,46
it follows three, therefore naturalism is
not true.


721
1:4:46,46 --> 1:4:52,76
So, if you think that you ever think about
anything you should conclude that naturalism


722
1:4:52,76 --> 1:4:54,25
is false.


723
1:4:54,25 --> 1:4:59,96
Second, the argument from meaning.
According to Dr. Rosenberg if naturalism is


724
1:4:59,96 --> 1:5:5,5
true, no sentence has any meaning.
He says that all the book...


725
1:5:5,5 --> 1:5:13,68
sentences in his own book are in fact meaningless,
but premise two, premise one has meaning.


726
1:5:13,68 --> 1:5:17,93
We all understood it.
Therefore it follows that three, naturalism


727
1:5:17,93 --> 1:5:21,5
is not true.


728
1:5:21,5 --> 1:5:28,51
Third, argument from truth.
According to Dr. Rosenberg if naturalism is


729
1:5:28,51 --> 1:5:34,78
true; there are no true sentences and that's
because they're all meaningless, but two,


730
1:5:34,78 --> 1:5:40,14
premise one is true, that's what the naturalist
believes and asserts, from which it follows


731
1:5:40,14 --> 1:5:44,43
three, therefore naturalism is not true.


732
1:5:44,43 --> 1:5:49,69
Fourth the argument from moral praise and
blame.


733
1:5:49,69 --> 1:5:54,47
According to Dr. Rosenberg if naturalism is
true, then I am not morally praise worthy


734
1:5:54,47 --> 1:6:0,18
or blame worthy for any of my actions, because
as I said on his view, objective moral values


735
1:6:0,18 --> 1:6:6,369
and duties do not exist, but two, I am morally
praise worthy and blame worthy for at least


736
1:6:6,369 --> 1:6:10,589
some of my actions.
If you think that you've ever done something


737
1:6:10,589 --> 1:6:17,13
truly wrong or truly good, then you should
conclude that three, therefore naturalism


738
1:6:17,13 --> 1:6:18,94
is not true.


739
1:6:18,94 --> 1:6:24,66
Fifth, the argument from freedom.
According to Dr. Rosenberg if naturalism is


740
1:6:24,66 --> 1:6:31,95
true, I do not do anything freely, everything
is determined; but two, I can freely agree


741
1:6:31,95 --> 1:6:39,0
or disagree with premise one, from which it
follows three, therefore naturalism is not


742
1:6:39,0 --> 1:6:40,349
true.


743
1:6:40,349 --> 1:6:46,559
Sixth, the argument from purpose.
According to Dr. Rosenberg if naturalism is


744
1:6:46,559 --> 1:6:55,16
true, I do not plan to do anything; but two,
I planned to come to tonight's debate, that's


745
1:6:55,16 --> 1:7:1,579
why I'm here, from which it follows three,
therefore naturalism is not true.


746
1:7:1,579 --> 1:7:7,19
Seventh, the argument from enduring.
According to Dr. Rosenberg if naturalism is


747
1:7:7,19 --> 1:7:15,599
true, I do not endure for two moments of time
but, two, I have been sitting here for more


748
1:7:15,599 --> 1:7:18,869
than a minute.
If you think that you're the same person who


749
1:7:18,869 --> 1:7:24,38
walked into the room tonight then you should
agree that three, therefore naturalism is


750
1:7:24,38 --> 1:7:25,95
not true.


751
1:7:25,95 --> 1:7:31,369
Finally, the argument from personal existence.
This is perhaps the "coup de gras" against


752
1:7:31,369 --> 1:7:34,41
naturalism.
According to Dr. Rosenberg, if naturalism


753
1:7:34,41 --> 1:7:40,609
is true, I do not exist.
He says, there are no selves, there are no


754
1:7:40,609 --> 1:7:45,49
persons, no first person perspectives; but
two, I do exist.


755
1:7:45,49 --> 1:7:51,339
I know this, as certainly as I know anything
from which it follows, therefore that naturalism


756
1:7:51,339 --> 1:7:53,42
is not true.


757
1:7:53,42 --> 1:8:0,369
In a word, metaphysical naturalism is "absurd".
Notice that my argument is not that it is


758
1:8:0,369 --> 1:8:6,2
"unappealing" rather it is that metaphysical
naturalism flies in the face of reason and


759
1:8:6,2 --> 1:8:12,869
experience and is therefore untenable.
So, in sum, epistemological naturalism is


760
1:8:12,869 --> 1:8:18,799
consistent with theism and metaphysical naturalism
is absurd.


761
1:8:18,799 --> 1:8:23,949
Let's now return to those arguments that I
offered for God's existence and see how Dr.


762
1:8:23,949 --> 1:8:25,819
Rosenberg responded to some of them.


763
1:8:25,819 --> 1:8:31,299
He didn't respond to the first argument why
anything exists rather than nothing.


764
1:8:31,299 --> 1:8:36,529
As for the origin of the universe, he says,
"But not everything has a cause.


765
1:8:36,529 --> 1:8:42,92
In quantum mechanics, virtual particles come
to be without a cause." Notice that he misstates


766
1:8:42,92 --> 1:8:46,5
the first premise, which is that the universe
began to exist.


767
1:8:46,5 --> 1:8:52,33
Then the second, if the universe began to
exist, the universe has a transcendent cause,


768
1:8:52,33 --> 1:8:56,91
that's because the universe can't come into
being out of nothing and virtual particles


769
1:8:56,91 --> 1:9:0,609
don't come out of nothing.
They come out of the quantum vacuum which


770
1:9:0,609 --> 1:9:3,13
is a sea of roiling energy.


771
1:9:3,13 --> 1:9:9,15
Moreover in quantum mechanics, it's not clear
that these entities are in fact uncaused.


772
1:9:9,15 --> 1:9:14,41
There are deterministic interpretations of
quantum mechanics according to which the behavior


773
1:9:14,41 --> 1:9:20,5
of these particles is fully determined.
Finally number three, I would say in response


774
1:9:20,5 --> 1:9:27,4
to this, that on the origin of the universe,
you have to believe the entire universe could


775
1:9:27,4 --> 1:9:32,569
come into being from non-being in order for
it to come to exist without a cause.


776
1:9:32,569 --> 1:9:37,17
I think that takes more faith than belief
in the existence of God.


777
1:9:37,17 --> 1:9:41,509
He didn't reply to the argument about the
applicability of mathematics in the world.


778
1:9:41,509 --> 1:9:46,739
As for the fine-tuning argument, he simply
appealed here once again to the multiverse


779
1:9:46,739 --> 1:9:50,549
hypothesis, but I refuted that in my opening
speech.


780
1:9:50,549 --> 1:9:55,91
If we were just a random member of a multiversal
world ensemble; then we ought to be having


781
1:9:55,91 --> 1:10:0,699
totally different observations than the ones
that we in fact have.


782
1:10:0,699 --> 1:10:6,13
Therefore that's why physicist like Roger
Penrose, have concluded that multiverse hypotheses


783
1:10:6,13 --> 1:10:11,54
are impotent to explain the fine-tuning of
the universe.


784
1:10:11,54 --> 1:10:14,719
He says perhaps you could have another basis
for life, like silicon.


785
1:10:14,719 --> 1:10:18,83
What he doesn't appreciate is that in the
absence of fine-tuning there wouldn't even


786
1:10:18,83 --> 1:10:25,17
be matter, there wouldn't even be chemistry,
much less stars and planets where life might


787
1:10:25,17 --> 1:10:28,87
evolve.
I don't think he really understands the extent


788
1:10:28,87 --> 1:10:33,719
of the fine-tuning of the universe and the
catastrophic consequences that would ensue


789
1:10:33,719 --> 1:10:36,98
if it were not finely-tuned.


790
1:10:36,98 --> 1:10:40,0
Intentional states of consciousness, he did
not respond to.


791
1:10:40,0 --> 1:10:45,46
As for objective moral values, in his book,
he admits that naturalism faces an even worse


792
1:10:45,46 --> 1:10:49,949
problem than the Euthyphro dilemma.
For the theist, the Euthyphro dilemma is easy


793
1:10:49,949 --> 1:10:56,64
to solve, namely you craft a third alternative
that God himself is the good and that his


794
1:10:56,64 --> 1:11:0,21
commands are necessary expressions of his
moral nature.


795
1:11:0,21 --> 1:11:6,58
So, they are neither arbitrary nor is the
good something external to God, but on Dr.


796
1:11:6,58 --> 1:11:11,92
Rosenberg's view there is no basis for moral
value or moral objectivity and that's why


797
1:11:11,92 --> 1:11:17,219
he is a moral nihilist who doesn't think that
anything is truly right or wrong.


798
1:11:17,219 --> 1:11:22,69
As for the resurrection of Jesus, he just
doesn't understand, I think, the credibility


799
1:11:22,69 --> 1:11:27,61
of the New Testament documents in this regard.
You can't compare them to Joseph Smith which


800
1:11:27,61 --> 1:11:33,39
were probably lies or to Muhammad's ascension
which is probably a legend, because in this


801
1:11:33,39 --> 1:11:39,89
case we are dealing with early eye witness
testimony that is not the result of conspiracy


802
1:11:39,89 --> 1:11:42,21
or lie.
These people sincerely believed what they


803
1:11:42,21 --> 1:11:46,92
said and that's why most historians accept
those three facts.


804
1:11:46,92 --> 1:11:51,29
Therefore the naturalist has got to come up
with some alternative explanation.


805
1:11:51,29 --> 1:11:56,88
You can't indict eye witness testimony in
general and then use that against a specific


806
1:11:56,88 --> 1:12:0,8
faith.
You have to show in the specific case of the


807
1:12:0,8 --> 1:12:4,84
gospels that this testimony is unreliable
and that is not the opinion of the majority


808
1:12:4,84 --> 1:12:7,84
of historians who investigated these documents.


809
1:12:7,84 --> 1:12:14,21
So, for all of these reasons, I think his
metaphysical naturalism is wholly unreasonable,


810
1:12:14,21 --> 1:12:19,42
whereas theism by contrast, I think is eminently
reasonable and plausible.


811
1:12:19,42 --> 1:12:22,33
(Audience clapping)


812
1:12:22,33 --> 1:12:39,17
Dr. Miller: All right, as soon as Dr. Rosenberg
begins, he has his 12-minute rebuttal.


813
1:12:39,17 --> 1:12:40,719
Timer, begin when he begins.


814
1:12:40,719 --> 1:12:46,77
Dr. Rosenberg: Gee, what a lot to cover.
So, I guess the way to begin is to say I wrote


815
1:12:46,77 --> 1:12:51,75
this book, The Atheist's Guide to Reality.
I actually didn't want to call it The Atheist's


816
1:12:51,75 --> 1:12:55,9
Guide to Reality, I wanted to call it something
else, but my editor said you'll sell a lot


817
1:12:55,9 --> 1:13:1,1
more books and even get yourself invited for
a debate like this if you title a book like


818
1:13:1,1 --> 1:13:2,61
this.


819
1:13:2,61 --> 1:13:7,71
Of course, the important thing to remember
about that book, The Atheist's Guide to Reality,


820
1:13:7,71 --> 1:13:13,98
is the structure of its argument; which was,
science has a number of important implications.


821
1:13:13,98 --> 1:13:19,51
In fact, first couple pages of my book I identify
14 of these implications.


822
1:13:19,51 --> 1:13:27,44
And most of them sound really bizarro; just
the way Professor Craig suggested in his remarks.


823
1:13:27,44 --> 1:13:33,77
The real issue is that among these 14 implications
of science that I argued ...


824
1:13:33,77 --> 1:13:41,3
I'll follow in my book ...
one of them is atheism and the others are


825
1:13:41,3 --> 1:13:47,33
that set of doctrines that Dr. Craig described
as absurd.


826
1:13:47,33 --> 1:13:54,21
None of them is supposed to follow from atheism.
None of the things that he says are manifestly


827
1:13:54,21 --> 1:13:59,16
false and that I've argued for in my book
follow from atheism.


828
1:13:59,16 --> 1:14:4,719
Therefore of course the modus tollens argument
as we call it in logic, that Professor Craig


829
1:14:4,719 --> 1:14:9,52
is trying to advance, is based on a complete
misrepresentation of what it says in that


830
1:14:9,52 --> 1:14:10,28
book.


831
1:14:10,28 --> 1:14:16,42
What it says in that book is that all of these
alleged absurdities along with atheism follow


832
1:14:16,42 --> 1:14:21,989
from the truth of science.
Now, you can reject all of these "alleged


833
1:14:21,989 --> 1:14:28,19
absurdities", but if I'm right about the logical
structure of my arguments, you got to reject


834
1:14:28,19 --> 1:14:30,87
science.
And I don't think Dr. Craig wants to reject


835
1:14:30,87 --> 1:14:35,679
science; because he's building God on his
interpretation of what science is supposed


836
1:14:35,679 --> 1:14:37,11
to show.


837
1:14:37,11 --> 1:14:41,969
The only thing you can do of course is, as
many of my philosophical colleagues are want


838
1:14:41,969 --> 1:14:50,17
to do, is reject the argument that I'm out...about
what science shows regarding these issues


839
1:14:50,17 --> 1:14:58,739
like free will, and the nature of the self,
and the grounds of morality, and of the purposelessness


840
1:14:58,739 --> 1:15:3,36
of the universe.
That's an interesting and important set of


841
1:15:3,36 --> 1:15:9,38
issues in philosophy and their issues in the
philosophy of science about the relationship


842
1:15:9,38 --> 1:15:14,14
between science and the agenda of the persistent
questions of philosophy.


843
1:15:14,14 --> 1:15:19,69
They are not questions about the relationship
between atheism and these persistent questions.


844
1:15:19,69 --> 1:15:27,85
And it's simply a Kalo mistake to suppose
that you could refute atheism by controverting


845
1:15:27,85 --> 1:15:34,5
these controversial doctrines that I argue
for in philosophy.


846
1:15:34,5 --> 1:15:41,87
We didn't come here tonight to debate metaphysical
naturalism or epistemological naturalism.


847
1:15:41,87 --> 1:15:48,27
We came here to debate whether the belief
in God, faith in God or as I've insisted we


848
1:15:48,27 --> 1:15:52,949
ought to substitute belief in God is reasonable
or not.


849
1:15:52,949 --> 1:16:2,1
And that question has practically nothing
to do with whether the strange theses that


850
1:16:2,1 --> 1:16:9,26
I argue for in this book are right or not.
I would cherish the opportunity to discuss


851
1:16:9,26 --> 1:16:12,929
the details of these arguments with Professor
Craig.


852
1:16:12,929 --> 1:16:16,34
Let's just take one example, the problem of
intentionality.


853
1:16:16,34 --> 1:16:20,3
The problem of intentionality is a really
hard problem to understand in philosophy.


854
1:16:20,3 --> 1:16:23,85
Dr. Craig mentioned a couple of times that
it's the ...


855
1:16:23,85 --> 1:16:27,429
intentionality is the fact that our thoughts
appear to be about stuff like I'm thinking


856
1:16:27,429 --> 1:16:31,28
about Craig now, and I'm thinking about the
timer that says I got eight and a half minutes


857
1:16:31,28 --> 1:16:34,34
to finish my rebuttal.
I'm thinking about stuff ...


858
1:16:34,34 --> 1:16:39,86
how is that possible, how is it possible for
one chunk of matter, my brain, to be about


859
1:16:39,86 --> 1:16:42,449
intrinsically about another chunk of matter.


860
1:16:42,449 --> 1:16:48,64
Dr. Craig or the sign announces eight minutes,
that is a profound mystery in philosophy with


861
1:16:48,64 --> 1:16:53,84
which philosophers have been trying to wrestle
certainly since Descartes and I think since


862
1:16:53,84 --> 1:16:58,88
Plato made the point in the Meno, one of his
other dialogues.


863
1:16:58,88 --> 1:17:4,199
How is it possible for one chunk of matter,
the brain, to be intrinsically about, directed


864
1:17:4,199 --> 1:17:6,429
at, pointing at, another chunk of matter?


865
1:17:6,429 --> 1:17:10,67
You may think that's not a problem, that's
not very difficult; but if you start reading


866
1:17:10,67 --> 1:17:16,16
Descartes, and you read Leibniz; and you read
the philosophers in the tradition of Western


867
1:17:16,16 --> 1:17:26,239
philosophy, you'll see that it's a huge problem.
Okay? It's a problem for science, for neuroscience.


868
1:17:26,239 --> 1:17:29,35
How is it that the wet stuff in the brain
can do this? Okay?


869
1:17:29,35 --> 1:17:34,14
There are two answers to this question.
One is Descartes' answer of dualism.


870
1:17:34,14 --> 1:17:36,84
There is a mind and it's independent of the
brain.


871
1:17:36,84 --> 1:17:42,55
It's a totally different spiritual substance.
Theists love this argument for obvious reasons.


872
1:17:42,55 --> 1:17:48,52
If there's a spiritual substance in us, a
soul, a person, a self, independent of our


873
1:17:48,52 --> 1:17:52,64
brain, well then of course if it's not physical,
it's indestructible and it's well on its way


874
1:17:52,64 --> 1:17:57,44
to immortality, which is just what the Christian
religion wants us to believe, okay, that's


875
1:17:57,44 --> 1:17:59,739
dualism.
Okay?


876
1:17:59,739 --> 1:18:5,1
Most scientists aren't dualist, there's the
odd exception, Eccles and even some philosophers


877
1:18:5,1 --> 1:18:9,969
like Descartes or Popper, but most scientists;
most neuroscientists think that cognition


878
1:18:9,969 --> 1:18:15,219
is a brain process.
The problem is to explain how the brain process,


879
1:18:15,219 --> 1:18:18,75
one chunk of matter, can have this property
of aboutness.


880
1:18:18,75 --> 1:18:25,98
That question has nothing to do ...
nothing interesting to do with atheism or


881
1:18:25,98 --> 1:18:26,85
theism.


882
1:18:26,85 --> 1:18:32,21
Let's take the matter of numbers, okay.
Dr. Craig says, it's a miracle or it's a wild


883
1:18:32,21 --> 1:18:40,6
coincidence that mathematics is applicable
to science, on my view.


884
1:18:40,6 --> 1:18:47,66
Well, he hasn't reckoned with the remarkable
number of alternative mathematical objects


885
1:18:47,66 --> 1:18:53,44
that mathematics have conjured up, have thought
about, have theorized about, or about the


886
1:18:53,44 --> 1:18:58,44
remarkable range of possible mathematical
functions relating these objects, okay.


887
1:18:58,44 --> 1:19:4,21
The fact is that we know that there are indefinitely
many mathematical objects and indefinitely


888
1:19:4,21 --> 1:19:8,19
many functions relating these mathematical
objects.


889
1:19:8,19 --> 1:19:14,13
And it's a sheer argument from ignorance to
suggest that the number is so small; the number


890
1:19:14,13 --> 1:19:21,82
that apply to the world of this vast range,
is so small that it demands divine authority


891
1:19:21,82 --> 1:19:26,73
to make it come out that way.
Just the geometries alone, the non-Euclidean


892
1:19:26,73 --> 1:19:30,4
geometries alone, there are indefinitely many
of them.


893
1:19:30,4 --> 1:19:38,73
And it happens that in the small one of them
appears to apply on this planet and in larger


894
1:19:38,73 --> 1:19:44,739
spaces another applies, but any one of an
indefinitely large number could perfectly


895
1:19:44,739 --> 1:19:50,29
well apply in the universe.
The suggestion that it's some mystery that


896
1:19:50,29 --> 1:19:58,199
could only be explained by God's good graciousness
to the physicists just seems to me, bizarre


897
1:19:58,199 --> 1:20:3,199
again, just something that "beggars the imagination".


898
1:20:3,199 --> 1:20:12,85
So, I guess the last thing I want to talk
about is Dr. Craig's brief rejoinder that


899
1:20:12,85 --> 1:20:26,2
...
that I somehow need or that he can get away


900
1:20:26,2 --> 1:20:32,35
with showing or with asserting that there's
no logical incompatibility between God's being


901
1:20:32,35 --> 1:20:37,59
omnipotent and benevolent and the existence
of suffering.


902
1:20:37,59 --> 1:20:45,64
Now, Christian philosophers have been worried
about this problem from hell at least since


903
1:20:45,64 --> 1:20:51,87
the greatest of them, Leibniz, okay.
They have done handsprings and twisted themselves


904
1:20:51,87 --> 1:20:58,8
up in knots to try to find some explanation,
because logically speaking if God is omniscient,


905
1:20:58,8 --> 1:21:5,11
and God is omnipotent, and God is truly benevolent
has a totally good will and would never will


906
1:21:5,11 --> 1:21:12,53
anything but for the best, then the existence
of suffering on our planet, human suffering,


907
1:21:12,53 --> 1:21:21,67
and natural suffering of other animals for
example, is something that needs desperately


908
1:21:21,67 --> 1:21:23,12
to be explained.


909
1:21:23,12 --> 1:21:27,25
And we've had over the course of 400 to 500
years of wrestling with this problem, the


910
1:21:27,25 --> 1:21:33,929
free will defense and the mystery-mongering,
it's God's will defense.


911
1:21:33,929 --> 1:21:41,64
And nobody has managed to provide a satisfactory
explanation and I insist that the problem


912
1:21:41,64 --> 1:21:46,719
is logical.
Dr. Craig needs to tell us exactly how an


913
1:21:46,719 --> 1:21:55,71
omnipotent God and entirely benevolent God
had to have the holocaust in order to produce


914
1:21:55,71 --> 1:22:4,6
the good outcome whatever it might be that
he intends for our ultimate providence.


915
1:22:4,6 --> 1:22:12,77
Couldn't he have just gotten away with World
War I, or the Great Leap Forward, or the 30


916
1:22:12,77 --> 1:22:19,63
years war which killed untold millions, or
the bubonic plague that killed 40% of the


917
1:22:19,63 --> 1:22:25,42
population of Europe? Did he have to have
every one of those in order to produce the


918
1:22:25,42 --> 1:22:34,409
kind of beneficent outcome which it is divine
providence to expect? I just don't see it.


919
1:22:34,409 --> 1:22:42,929
I cannot understand it.
I find it offensive and I find it perplexing.


920
1:22:42,929 --> 1:22:52,5
And in all honesty, if Dr. Craig could provide
me with any kind of a logical, coherent account


921
1:22:52,5 --> 1:23:0,86
that could reconcile the evident fact of the
horrors of human and infrahuman life on this


922
1:23:0,86 --> 1:23:7,59
planet over the last 3.5 billion years, with
the existence of a benevolent, omnipotent


923
1:23:7,59 --> 1:23:15,489
agent, then I will turn Christian.
Thank you.


924
1:23:15,489 --> 1:23:18,78
(Audience clapping)


925
1:23:18,78 --> 1:23:25,719
Dr. Miller: Okay, we now begin our eight-minute
rebuttals.


926
1:23:25,719 --> 1:23:29,96
Dr. Craig anytime you're ready.
Timer, begin when he starts speaking.


927
1:23:29,96 --> 1:23:37,78
Dr. Craig: I am really excited about that
last statement (audience laughing) that Dr.


928
1:23:37,78 --> 1:23:44,17
Rosenberg made (audience clapping).
Honestly, Dr. Rosenberg if you were to read


929
1:23:44,17 --> 1:23:51,969
the work of people like Alvin Plantinga, Peter
van Inwagen, and others on this problem with


930
1:23:51,969 --> 1:23:56,58
evil, you would know that hardly anyone today
defends the logical version of the problem


931
1:23:56,58 --> 1:24:1,1
of evil; because the atheist simply hasn't
been able to shoulder the burden of proof


932
1:24:1,1 --> 1:24:2,989
required to put it through.


933
1:24:2,989 --> 1:24:7,56
Listen to what Paul Draper who is an agnostic
philosopher here in the Department of Purdue


934
1:24:7,56 --> 1:24:11,1
says.
He says, "Logical arguments from evil are


935
1:24:11,1 --> 1:24:18,79
a dying (dead) breed".
For all we know, even an omnipotent and omniscient


936
1:24:18,79 --> 1:24:25,3
being, might be forced to allow evil for the
sake of obtaining some important good.


937
1:24:25,3 --> 1:24:30,449
Our knowledge of goods and evils and the logical
relations they have to each other is much


938
1:24:30,449 --> 1:24:34,76
too limited to prove that this could not be
the case."


939
1:24:34,76 --> 1:24:40,11
In particular the atheist assumes that if
God is all powerful, He can create just any


940
1:24:40,11 --> 1:24:43,52
world that he wants and that's not necessarily
true.


941
1:24:43,52 --> 1:24:49,0
If God wills to create free creatures then
he can't guarantee they'll always do what


942
1:24:49,0 --> 1:24:53,1
is right.
It's logically impossible to make someone


943
1:24:53,1 --> 1:24:57,3
freely do something.
So, God's being all-powerful doesn't mean


944
1:24:57,3 --> 1:24:59,12
He can do the logically impossible.


945
1:24:59,12 --> 1:25:4,659
So, the atheist would have to prove there's
a world of free creatures which God could


946
1:25:4,659 --> 1:25:11,12
create which has as much good as this world
but without as much evil.


947
1:25:11,12 --> 1:25:16,17
How could he possibly prove that, that's pure
speculation? What about the other premise


948
1:25:16,17 --> 1:25:20,199
that if God is all good, then He would create
a world without evil.


949
1:25:20,199 --> 1:25:25,35
Well, the problem here is that we're assuming
that God's purpose is just to make us happy


950
1:25:25,35 --> 1:25:29,37
in this life, but on the Christian view, that's
false.


951
1:25:29,37 --> 1:25:35,67
The purpose of life is not worldly happiness
as such but rather the knowledge of God.


952
1:25:35,67 --> 1:25:40,98
There may be many evils that occur in this
lifetime that are utterly pointless with respect


953
1:25:40,98 --> 1:25:46,179
to producing worldly happiness but they may
not be pointless with respect to producing


954
1:25:46,179 --> 1:25:50,9
a knowledge of God and salvation and eternal
life.


955
1:25:50,9 --> 1:25:53,42
It's possibly ...
it's possible that only in the world that


956
1:25:53,42 --> 1:25:58,54
is suffused with natural and moral evil that
the optimal number of people would come to


957
1:25:58,54 --> 1:26:3,1
know God freely, find salvation and eternal
life.


958
1:26:3,1 --> 1:26:8,219
So, the atheist would have to prove that there's
another possible world that has this much


959
1:26:8,219 --> 1:26:13,86
knowledge of God and His salvation in, but
which is produced with less evils.


960
1:26:13,86 --> 1:26:17,17
How could he possibly prove that? It's pure
conjecture.


961
1:26:17,17 --> 1:26:22,44
It's impossible to prove those things; and
that's why the logical version of the problem


962
1:26:22,44 --> 1:26:27,38
of evil has been widely abandoned.
Peter van Inwagen, Professor of Philosophy


963
1:26:27,38 --> 1:26:32,27
at Notre Dame, says, "It used to be held that
evil was incompatible with the existence of


964
1:26:32,27 --> 1:26:36,409
God, that no possible world contained both
God and evil.


965
1:26:36,409 --> 1:26:40,699
So far as I am able to tell this thesis is
no longer defended."


966
1:26:40,699 --> 1:26:48,489
So, Dr. Rosenberg, I want to invite you to
think about becoming a theist tonight, because


967
1:26:48,489 --> 1:26:55,0
the main obstacle that you presented is need
not be an obstacle for you anymore.


968
1:26:55,0 --> 1:26:59,38
What about the positive arguments that I offered
for God's existence? The first one is why


969
1:26:59,38 --> 1:27:6,31
anything at all exists? There's been no response
in tonight's debate to this first argument.


970
1:27:6,31 --> 1:27:10,58
You can't just say the universe exists without
an explanation, if it's contingent.


971
1:27:10,58 --> 1:27:14,96
If it is contingent, as Dr. Rosenberg states
in his book, there could have been nothing,


972
1:27:14,96 --> 1:27:21,8
so why is there something rather than nothing?
The theist has an explanation but the atheist


973
1:27:21,8 --> 1:27:25,69
by its own admission has no explanation.
What about the problem of the origin of the


974
1:27:25,69 --> 1:27:26,219
universe?


975
1:27:26,219 --> 1:27:31,54
I showed that it's to no avail to appeal to
quantum mechanics, because in quantum mechanics


976
1:27:31,54 --> 1:27:35,409
things don't come into being from non-being,
from nothing, they come out of the energy


977
1:27:35,409 --> 1:27:40,87
in the vacuum; but for the universe to come
into being, it would have to come from literally


978
1:27:40,87 --> 1:27:45,54
nothing, because the beginning of the universe
is the beginning of all matter and energy


979
1:27:45,54 --> 1:27:47,32
and space and time.


980
1:27:47,32 --> 1:27:53,31
Again theism has an explanation for how the
universe came into being, but atheism is impotent


981
1:27:53,31 --> 1:27:57,59
in this regard.
The applicability of mathematics, all Dr.


982
1:27:57,59 --> 1:28:2,89
Rosenberg could say is there are various alternative
mathematics like non-Euclidean geometries.


983
1:28:2,89 --> 1:28:8,949
That doesn't go one-inch toward explaining
why our physical universe is structured on


984
1:28:8,949 --> 1:28:13,88
this incredibly complex mathematical structure
and foundation.


985
1:28:13,88 --> 1:28:19,3
Again the theist has an easy explanation.
God constructed the universe on this mathematical


986
1:28:19,3 --> 1:28:23,28
structure.
The naturalist is at a lost to explain it.


987
1:28:23,28 --> 1:28:28,199
What about the fine-tuning of the universe?
I explained the disasters results that would


988
1:28:28,199 --> 1:28:33,4
ensue if the universe were not fine-tuned.
I also explained why you can't dismiss this


989
1:28:33,4 --> 1:28:38,82
problem by the multiverse hypothesis; and
there has been no response to that.


990
1:28:38,82 --> 1:28:44,84
Intentional states of consciousness, Dr. Rosenberg
says, "How can one chunk of matter be about


991
1:28:44,84 --> 1:28:50,67
another one?" I agree with him on this.
It can't and that leads him to deny that we


992
1:28:50,67 --> 1:28:55,199
ever think about anything.
It leads me rather to say but I do think about


993
1:28:55,199 --> 1:29:1,64
things, therefore there must be minds.
And minds fit nicely into a theistic world


994
1:29:1,64 --> 1:29:7,57
view, because God is the ultimate mind and
so the presence of finite minds in this world


995
1:29:7,57 --> 1:29:11,909
is nothing mysterious.
It fits into a theistic world in a way that


996
1:29:11,909 --> 1:29:14,61
it doesn't fit into an atheistic world.


997
1:29:14,61 --> 1:29:20,87
As for objective moral values, it's the same
situation, Dr. Rosenberg rightly understands


998
1:29:20,87 --> 1:29:26,44
that if atheism is true, if metaphysical naturalism
is true, there are no objective moral values


999
1:29:26,44 --> 1:29:30,58
and duties.
He and I actually agree on a great deal, but


1000
1:29:30,58 --> 1:29:34,989
what I would say is obviously it is wrong
to do certain things.


1001
1:29:34,989 --> 1:29:39,28
Therefore it follows that there must be a
foundation for moral values beyond the physical


1002
1:29:39,28 --> 1:29:43,23
world in God, a transcendent personal being.


1003
1:29:43,23 --> 1:29:47,39
The resurrection of Jesus, again you can't
discuss this responsibly without getting your


1004
1:29:47,39 --> 1:29:53,69
fingers dirty and looking at those documents.
You can't attack other documents like Joseph


1005
1:29:53,69 --> 1:29:58,219
Smith and Muhammad and use those to impugn
the credibility of the gospel sources.


1006
1:29:58,219 --> 1:30:3,659
The fact is that the majority of New Testament
historians, who have investigated these documents,


1007
1:30:3,659 --> 1:30:6,42
have concluded to those three facts that I
mentioned.


1008
1:30:6,42 --> 1:30:9,87
Remember N.T.
Wright says, they're as firmly established


1009
1:30:9,87 --> 1:30:14,71
as the fall of Jerusalem in A.D.
70, but the naturalist has no explanation.


1010
1:30:14,71 --> 1:30:20,71
Finally, God can be personally known and experienced.
Why can't God be a properly basic belief for


1011
1:30:20,71 --> 1:30:25,4
me, grounded in my experience of God? I don't
see why not.


1012
1:30:25,4 --> 1:30:30,12
Finally, what about metaphysical naturalism?
How is this relevant in tonight's debate?


1013
1:30:30,12 --> 1:30:36,219
He says these bizarre consequences that he
affirms don't follow from atheism, they follow


1014
1:30:36,219 --> 1:30:44,0
from scientism; but my argument was that scientism
or epistemological naturalism doesn't imply


1015
1:30:44,0 --> 1:30:47,33
metaphysical naturalism; remember the case
of W.V.O.


1016
1:30:47,33 --> 1:30:55,87
Quine, "...but if God does not exist then
I think metaphysical naturalism is true".


1017
1:30:55,87 --> 1:31:0,76
Metaphysical naturalism doesn't follow from
epistemological naturalism, but it does follow


1018
1:31:0,76 --> 1:31:5,659
from atheism.
The most plausible form of atheism is I think


1019
1:31:5,659 --> 1:31:11,51
metaphysical naturalism, but there are all
those absurd consequences that result from


1020
1:31:11,51 --> 1:31:15,949
that that I described.
He bites the bullet and affirms these bizarre


1021
1:31:15,949 --> 1:31:21,17
consequences.
Why not stand back and say, no this is crazy


1022
1:31:21,17 --> 1:31:23,37
this is not the world we live in?


1023
1:31:23,37 --> 1:31:28,9
Ours must be a theistic world.
If his only obstacle is the logical problem


1024
1:31:28,9 --> 1:31:35,34
of evil; then that obstacle has now been removed.
Dr. Rosenberg should find himself free to


1025
1:31:35,34 --> 1:31:42,9
embrace, joyfully, the existence of God as
the answer to these deep questions.


1026
1:31:42,9 --> 1:31:46,92
(Audience clapping).


1027
1:31:46,92 --> 1:31:58,489
Dr. Miller: Professor Rosenberg may now begin
his eight-minute rebuttal.


1028
1:31:58,489 --> 1:32:0,61
Timer.


1029
1:32:0,61 --> 1:32:11,31
Dr. Rosenberg: So, just as, of course, Dr.
Craig is repeating himself.


1030
1:32:11,31 --> 1:32:17,7
I guess I don't have much recourse but to
repeat myself, because just as he suggests


1031
1:32:17,7 --> 1:32:22,159
that I haven't answered one or another of
his points, he similarly hasn't answered any


1032
1:32:22,159 --> 1:32:25,88
number of mine.
But, that's the problem with this kind of


1033
1:32:25,88 --> 1:32:28,469
a debate and this kind of a format, it doesn't
work.


1034
1:32:28,469 --> 1:32:34,48
It doesn't work because what I would like
to be able to do is ask William Lane Craig


1035
1:32:34,48 --> 1:32:39,1
a question and listen to his answer and formulate
a reply, and listen to his answer, and then


1036
1:32:39,1 --> 1:32:45,86
give a view, and listen to his question; which
is the way in which philosophical dialogue


1037
1:32:45,86 --> 1:32:52,67
proceeds and which enables us at least to
find out where the crucial issues are between


1038
1:32:52,67 --> 1:32:57,34
us and how we could mutually agree to adjudicate
these matters.


1039
1:32:57,34 --> 1:33:3,6
So now, I really need to know why he's so
committed to the principle of sufficient reason


1040
1:33:3,6 --> 1:33:10,63
which underwrites a good half of the arguments
from science which he advances for us.


1041
1:33:10,63 --> 1:33:16,1
I made the point that the principles of sufficient
reason is false, it's not just that it's not


1042
1:33:16,1 --> 1:33:23,659
known to be true; it's that it's just plain
out flat false and disconfirmed all over the


1043
1:33:23,659 --> 1:33:32,2
galaxy, all over the universe, all over the
multiverse; indefinitely many times in an


1044
1:33:32,2 --> 1:33:35,23
infinitesimally small units of time.


1045
1:33:35,23 --> 1:33:43,9
And I don't understand why he insists that
it's just intuitively obvious, it's just ...


1046
1:33:43,9 --> 1:33:50,64
"What could be more obvious that from nothing,
nothing can come, that if something exists


1047
1:33:50,64 --> 1:33:59,78
there had to be a prior entity of some sort
which brought it about?" We know that alpha


1048
1:33:59,78 --> 1:34:5,76
particles come into existence for no reason
at all, every moment in this room.


1049
1:34:5,76 --> 1:34:11,37
Why should we assume that the universe is
any different? Why should we assume that purely


1050
1:34:11,37 --> 1:34:18,9
quantum mechanical fluctuations symmetry breaking,
which we understand is the explanation for


1051
1:34:18,9 --> 1:34:22,5
why there's matter in the universe and not
anti-matter.


1052
1:34:22,5 --> 1:34:30,88
Why this process which produces the characteristic
features of our universe and does so without


1053
1:34:30,88 --> 1:34:35,63
there being a cause for it happening one way
or the other, why the symmetry gets broken


1054
1:34:35,63 --> 1:34:42,8
one way or the other.
Could it be the nature of reality as far back


1055
1:34:42,8 --> 1:34:46,78
as we can possibly dig in cosmology?


1056
1:34:46,78 --> 1:34:51,219
Let's talk about the argument from evil.
I keep hearing these quotes.


1057
1:34:51,219 --> 1:34:59,429
He's even invoking my best friend, Peter van
Inwagen, asserting that nobody anymore believes


1058
1:34:59,429 --> 1:35:4,88
that the argument from evil is a problem for
theism.


1059
1:35:4,88 --> 1:35:5,84
Not ...
where I come from ...


1060
1:35:5,84 --> 1:35:13,82
where I come from that's the first thing that
we worry about, how can you reconcile theism


1061
1:35:13,82 --> 1:35:17,85
and evil.
Now, you can reconcile God and evil if you


1062
1:35:17,85 --> 1:35:23,82
reduce his power from omnipotence or you reduce
his benevolence to only, "he's pretty good"


1063
1:35:23,82 --> 1:35:28,429
or "he's good most of the time".


1064
1:35:28,429 --> 1:35:33,409
Even a philosopher like Peter van Inwagen,
who I think is probably the best metaphysician


1065
1:35:33,409 --> 1:35:41,139
working in our field today, even he, can't
go any further than in his book The Problem


1066
1:35:41,139 --> 1:35:46,409
of Evil, his Gifford Lectures in 2004.
Even he can't go any further than saying that


1067
1:35:46,409 --> 1:35:55,46
he thinks that the argument from evil is not
decisive; that it doesn't absolutely and completely


1068
1:35:55,46 --> 1:36:0,57
destroy theism.
It's not as he says a successful argument.


1069
1:36:0,57 --> 1:36:6,449
The reasons that he gives, I would be embarrassed
to lay before you; because they have to do


1070
1:36:6,449 --> 1:36:11,4
with an argument called the Sorites an argument
that has been known since the time of the


1071
1:36:11,4 --> 1:36:15,739
Greeks.
And that is the sort of argument that gives


1072
1:36:15,739 --> 1:36:23,76
philosophy a bad name among more well-grounded,
less theoretical people.


1073
1:36:23,76 --> 1:36:29,7
Professor Craig invoked the free will defense
that God gave us free will.


1074
1:36:29,7 --> 1:36:36,85
And because he gave us free will, he gave
us the power to do evil and the evil is done


1075
1:36:36,85 --> 1:36:43,17
by us as a result of our exercise of free
will.


1076
1:36:43,17 --> 1:36:47,34
Well, I have three things to say about this.
The first is he didn't need ...


1077
1:36:47,34 --> 1:36:53,13
he could have given us freewill without giving
us the holocaust or the bubonic plague.


1078
1:36:53,13 --> 1:36:57,6
He could have done it with...
given us freewill, without giving us all the


1079
1:36:57,6 --> 1:37:1,199
horrors of the history of our species.


1080
1:37:1,199 --> 1:37:7,59
The second thing is he made some people, apparently,
and gave them free will and they caused no


1081
1:37:7,59 --> 1:37:14,48
suffering at all, whether it's small children
or the saints of the Catholic Church or whoever


1082
1:37:14,48 --> 1:37:22,929
your favorite person without sin, may be.
The third thing is this; let's think about


1083
1:37:22,929 --> 1:37:28,46
the following very simple thought experiment.
Supposed I give you all an arithmetic test.


1084
1:37:28,46 --> 1:37:31,179
You all have free will.
You can all choose.


1085
1:37:31,179 --> 1:37:35,8
I give you an arithmetic test.
It's a hundred questions and they're all of


1086
1:37:35,8 --> 1:37:44,67
the form three plus five equals, or 16 divided
by two equals, or the square of four equals.


1087
1:37:44,67 --> 1:37:51,98
I offer you a thousand dollars for each right
answer and excruciating pain for each wrong


1088
1:37:51,98 --> 1:37:54,25
answer.
Right? You all have freewill.


1089
1:37:54,25 --> 1:37:59,1
How many of you are going to give me any wrong
answers? None of you.


1090
1:37:59,1 --> 1:38:3,889
You're all going to have a thousand ...
$10,000 at the end of a 10 question arithmetic


1091
1:38:3,889 --> 1:38:6,5
test.
You all had free will.


1092
1:38:6,5 --> 1:38:9,639
You all chose freely.
And you always gave me the right answer.


1093
1:38:9,639 --> 1:38:16,21
Why couldn't God have arranged the universe
and us, so that we all have free will and


1094
1:38:16,21 --> 1:38:24,4
temptation was never presented to us? Or when
it was presented to us, we always chose rightly.


1095
1:38:24,4 --> 1:38:29,98
Why couldn't God have arranged matters that
way, given us freewill and so arranged matters


1096
1:38:29,98 --> 1:38:37,15
that in our exercise of freewill we never
chose evil, we never chose the outcome that


1097
1:38:37,15 --> 1:38:42,83
produced suffering from anybody? That seems
to me a logical coherent possibility and it's


1098
1:38:42,83 --> 1:38:48,3
enough to show that the problem of evil remains
with us.


1099
1:38:48,3 --> 1:38:53,429
New Testament scholarship.
You know, I have great respect for New Testament


1100
1:38:53,429 --> 1:38:59,37
scholars and for the higher criticism and
for the deep scholars of the Christian religion,


1101
1:38:59,37 --> 1:39:4,78
who study the New Testament.
Some of them have told us that 75% of it was


1102
1:39:4,78 --> 1:39:10,86
forged and all of us tell us that it was written
by people who were illiterate.


1103
1:39:10,86 --> 1:39:18,55
And most of them recognize that the writings
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John could not have


1104
1:39:18,55 --> 1:39:25,13
dated from any earlier than 30 or 40 or 50
years after Jesus lived.


1105
1:39:25,13 --> 1:39:31,13
Of course, the Aramaic in which they were
written, was completely lost and all the extant


1106
1:39:31,13 --> 1:39:33,989
New Testaments are in Greek.


1107
1:39:33,989 --> 1:39:42,139
And therefore the opportunity for misrepresentation,
or mistranscription, or other kinds of mistakes


1108
1:39:42,139 --> 1:39:48,98
was huge and indeed has been documented by
scholarship over the last 200 years, but most


1109
1:39:48,98 --> 1:39:55,28
of all why should we accept the credibility
of Christian scholars writing about Christian


1110
1:39:55,28 --> 1:40:0,26
documents? No more than we should accept the
scholarship of Islamic scholars writing about


1111
1:40:0,26 --> 1:40:6,449
Islamic documents, or scientologist's writing
about Scientology.


1112
1:40:6,449 --> 1:40:10,71
(Audience clapping)


1113
1:40:10,71 --> 1:40:19,679
Dr. Miller: Dr. Craig will now begin his closing
statement.


1114
1:40:19,679 --> 1:40:21,59
He has five minutes.


1115
1:40:21,59 --> 1:40:31,28
Dr. Craig: Well, I want to thank Dr. Rosenberg
for a very stimulating debate this evening.


1116
1:40:31,28 --> 1:40:34,8
I hope that you've enjoyed it as much as I
have.


1117
1:40:34,8 --> 1:40:38,8
In my closing statement, I'd like to draw
together some of the threads of this debate


1118
1:40:38,8 --> 1:40:44,31
and see if we can come to some conclusions.
In tonight's debate, I presented eight reasons


1119
1:40:44,31 --> 1:40:51,8
why it's reasonable to believe in God and
eight reasons why metaphysical naturalism


1120
1:40:51,8 --> 1:40:54,28
is unreasonable in fact absurd.


1121
1:40:54,28 --> 1:41:0,699
Dr. Rosenberg has presented only one argument
for atheism tonight and that is the problem


1122
1:41:0,699 --> 1:41:4,699
of evil.
And it was very clear in his last speech that


1123
1:41:4,699 --> 1:41:8,76
he hasn't understood it.
He says, why couldn't God have created people


1124
1:41:8,76 --> 1:41:14,37
with free will so that they always chose to
do the right thing? This has been dealt with


1125
1:41:14,37 --> 1:41:20,8
by theist's dealing with the problem of evil.
And the reason is because the wrong subjunctive


1126
1:41:20,8 --> 1:41:25,489
conditionals of freedom might be true for
God to actualize such a world.


1127
1:41:25,489 --> 1:41:31,15
There are possible worlds which are not feasible
for God to actualize, because if he were to


1128
1:41:31,15 --> 1:41:36,79
create the creatures in certain circumstances
and leave them free they would go wrong.


1129
1:41:36,79 --> 1:41:41,59
As far as we know, for all we know in any
world of free creatures in which there is


1130
1:41:41,59 --> 1:41:45,85
this much good in the world, there would also
be this much evil.


1131
1:41:45,85 --> 1:41:51,48
It may not be feasible for God to actualize
a world having this much good without this


1132
1:41:51,48 --> 1:41:52,409
much evil.


1133
1:41:52,409 --> 1:41:57,8
That doesn't mean the holocaust is necessary,
no not at all, but it would mean that in a


1134
1:41:57,8 --> 1:42:2,1
world in which say, the holocaust didn't occur,
other events would have occur that would have


1135
1:42:2,1 --> 1:42:6,239
been comparably evil.
So, what Dr. Rosenberg again would have to


1136
1:42:6,239 --> 1:42:10,54
show or that the atheist would have to show
is that there's no ...


1137
1:42:10,54 --> 1:42:15,44
he would have to show that God has the ability
to create another world, another possible


1138
1:42:15,44 --> 1:42:21,159
world of free creatures that would involve
this much knowledge of God and eternal salvation


1139
1:42:21,159 --> 1:42:24,61
as in the actual world, but without as much
suffering.


1140
1:42:24,61 --> 1:42:29,52
And there's no way that the atheist could
prove that, it's utter speculation and that's


1141
1:42:29,52 --> 1:42:33,949
why the argument is regarded today as bankrupt.


1142
1:42:33,949 --> 1:42:40,27
Now, with respect to the arguments for metaphysical
naturalism.


1143
1:42:40,27 --> 1:42:46,83
I think what Dr. Rosenberg has done for us
is he has described brilliantly what an atheistic


1144
1:42:46,83 --> 1:42:51,65
world would be like.
It is a world in which there is no meaning,


1145
1:42:51,65 --> 1:42:58,59
no truth, no thoughts about anything, no moral
values, no enduring selves and no first person


1146
1:42:58,59 --> 1:43:3,489
perspectives.
His only mistake lies in thinking that that


1147
1:43:3,489 --> 1:43:11,81
world is our world, but it manifestly is not,
our world is not Dr. Rosenberg's world.


1148
1:43:11,81 --> 1:43:17,96
Our world is a world in which we do exist.
We do have thoughts about things in which


1149
1:43:17,96 --> 1:43:24,679
there is therefore meaning, truth, and value.
Dr. Rosenberg admits that theism provides


1150
1:43:24,679 --> 1:43:28,4
a better explanation of such a world than
does atheism.


1151
1:43:28,4 --> 1:43:34,71
And since our world is evidently such a world,
it follows, I think that it is reasonable


1152
1:43:34,71 --> 1:43:36,88
to believe in God.


1153
1:43:36,88 --> 1:43:42,19
In addition to that, I presented eight arguments
for belief in God.


1154
1:43:42,19 --> 1:43:45,94
He, in his last speech, said, "Why are you
so committed to the principle of sufficient


1155
1:43:45,94 --> 1:43:53,21
reason?" Because a very modest version of
that is plausibly true; namely that if a contingent


1156
1:43:53,21 --> 1:43:59,13
thing exists, there's a reason or an explanation
to why it exists rather than not.


1157
1:43:59,13 --> 1:44:3,889
Given that principle which is very plausible
and modest, you need an explanation for why


1158
1:44:3,889 --> 1:44:5,67
the universe exists.


1159
1:44:5,67 --> 1:44:9,79
This is especially evident if the universe
came into being at some point in the finite


1160
1:44:9,79 --> 1:44:13,37
past.
It can't just come from non-being.


1161
1:44:13,37 --> 1:44:18,86
I won't repeat what I said about the applicability
of mathematics, intentional states of consciousness,


1162
1:44:18,86 --> 1:44:24,13
objective moral values, the resurrection of
Jesus, the sources we have for the resurrection


1163
1:44:24,13 --> 1:44:27,84
of Jesus go back to within five years of the
event.


1164
1:44:27,84 --> 1:44:30,84
And they were not written in Aramaic.
He is just incorrect.


1165
1:44:30,84 --> 1:44:35,23
They were written in Greek.
We have the New Testament in the original


1166
1:44:35,23 --> 1:44:41,65
language in which it was written and the text
is 99.8% authentic and pure.


1167
1:44:41,65 --> 1:44:45,239
So, doubts on that head are simply groundless.


1168
1:44:45,239 --> 1:44:49,139
The one thing that we haven't talked about
tonight is my eighth point that God can be


1169
1:44:49,139 --> 1:44:54,8
personally known and experienced.
And I want to close by saying this, I myself


1170
1:44:54,8 --> 1:45:1,28
wasn't raised in a believing home, although
it was a good and loving home; but when I


1171
1:45:1,28 --> 1:45:6,35
was in high school as a junior, I met a Christian
who sat in front of me in German class, who


1172
1:45:6,35 --> 1:45:9,4
shared with me her faith about God's love.


1173
1:45:9,4 --> 1:45:13,87
I had never heard of this before.
I began to read the New Testament, and as


1174
1:45:13,87 --> 1:45:17,4
I did I was captivated by the person of Jesus
of Nazareth.


1175
1:45:17,4 --> 1:45:21,86
Well, I went through a period of six months
of soul searching, at the end of which, I


1176
1:45:21,86 --> 1:45:25,639
just came to the end my rope and gave my life
to Christ.


1177
1:45:25,639 --> 1:45:31,2
I experienced an inner spiritual rebirth that
I've walked with day-by-day, year-by-year


1178
1:45:31,2 --> 1:45:32,94
now for over 40 years.


1179
1:45:32,94 --> 1:45:37,98
A spiritual reality, that I believe you can
find as well if you will seek Him with an


1180
1:45:37,98 --> 1:45:41,9
open mind and an open heart.
So as I close tonight, I would encourage you,


1181
1:45:41,9 --> 1:45:45,76
if you're seeking for God, do what I did.
Pick up the New Testament, begin to read,


1182
1:45:45,76 --> 1:45:51,5
and ask yourself, "Could this really be the
truth? Could there be a God who loves me and


1183
1:45:51,5 --> 1:45:56,9
cares for me? Who gave himself for me?" I
believe it could change your life; just as


1184
1:45:56,9 --> 1:46:6,4
it changed mine.
(Audience clapping)


1185
1:46:6,4 --> 1:46:16,77
Dr. Miller: Professor Rosenberg will now give
his five-minute concluding statement.


1186
1:46:16,77 --> 1:46:21,78
Dr. Rosenberg: So, here's another positive
argument for atheism.


1187
1:46:21,78 --> 1:46:28,199
It's sort of so obvious that I hadn't thought
I should introduce it and I certainly didn't


1188
1:46:28,199 --> 1:46:32,719
think I was going to have time, but this back
and forth has gone on so long that I've got


1189
1:46:32,719 --> 1:46:36,199
this last chance and I'm going to use it.


1190
1:46:36,199 --> 1:46:47,51
So, why is it that God is a hypothesis that
science has so little use for? You may recall


1191
1:46:47,51 --> 1:46:54,199
when the King of France, Louis the XIV approached
Laplace the Great 18th century physicist and


1192
1:46:54,199 --> 1:47:2,27
said what is the role of God in your system.
The answer was, "I have no need of that hypothesis".


1193
1:47:2,27 --> 1:47:7,84
Of course the reason that science has no need
of the hypothesis, is that God makes no contribution


1194
1:47:7,84 --> 1:47:13,33
to the predictive power of any part of any
of the sciences.


1195
1:47:13,33 --> 1:47:20,61
For that reason, there's no basis on which
to invoke God either for explanatory or any


1196
1:47:20,61 --> 1:47:27,3
other purposes in science.
Therefore science has no more need for and


1197
1:47:27,3 --> 1:47:35,449
indeed a considerable reason to deny the existence
of God than it has to accept the Easter Bunny,


1198
1:47:35,449 --> 1:47:45,0
or the Tooth Fairy, or Santa Claus.
The absence of a role for God in the predictive


1199
1:47:45,0 --> 1:47:52,199
and explanatory content of science is quite
apart from the problem of evil, the principle


1200
1:47:52,199 --> 1:47:56,92
reason why 95% of the members of the National
Academy of Science in the United States are


1201
1:47:56,92 --> 1:48:3,52
atheists; and why science can provide not
only no good basis for theism, but an excellent


1202
1:48:3,52 --> 1:48:5,42
argument against it.


1203
1:48:5,42 --> 1:48:10,909
Indeed, if we think back to the invocation
of Willard Van Orman Quine, the Great American


1204
1:48:10,909 --> 1:48:20,3
Philosopher by Professor Craig, we'll recall
that he pointed out that Quine adopts abstract


1205
1:48:20,3 --> 1:48:25,179
objects, the objects of mathematics as existing
even though they are abstract, even though


1206
1:48:25,179 --> 1:48:30,159
they're not concrete, even though they're
not physical items in the world.


1207
1:48:30,159 --> 1:48:37,88
Why? Because they were indispensible to their
predictive power of science; and because they're


1208
1:48:37,88 --> 1:48:43,699
indispensible, Quine had no good argument
against them and said that science not only


1209
1:48:43,699 --> 1:48:48,59
had no good argument against them, but in
fact it had a good argument for their existence


1210
1:48:48,59 --> 1:48:57,55
because of the contribution they made to enabling
us to predict detailed experiments meter readings,


1211
1:48:57,55 --> 1:49:4,719
right, of scientific experiments, which is
the "litmus test of reasonability" among science


1212
1:49:4,719 --> 1:49:6,17
...
scientists.


1213
1:49:6,17 --> 1:49:11,35
And to invoke the objects of mathematics,
as a part of an argument for the existence


1214
1:49:11,35 --> 1:49:20,929
of God, fails to reflect this indispensible
fact about the reasons that scientists are


1215
1:49:20,929 --> 1:49:25,13
committed to do.
If God could do as much for science as the


1216
1:49:25,13 --> 1:49:29,739
number two, physicists would be much more
receptive to his existence.


1217
1:49:29,739 --> 1:49:37,36
So, let me end this debate with a little advice
from an atheist.


1218
1:49:37,36 --> 1:49:47,469
Dr. Craig has ended by making a personal statement
about the importance of Jesus Christ to his


1219
1:49:47,469 --> 1:49:55,27
own character and well being, his own spiritual
state.


1220
1:49:55,27 --> 1:50:3,26
Believe if you want to, have faith in Jesus
Christ if you need to, but do not make yourself


1221
1:50:3,26 --> 1:50:9,7
vulnerable to reason and evidence, do not
demand that your belief be reasonable.


1222
1:50:9,7 --> 1:50:12,9
You will be threatened with the loss of your
faith.


1223
1:50:12,9 --> 1:50:14,54
You may well lose your faith.


1224
1:50:14,54 --> 1:50:21,19
Those who have lost their faith in God are
generally those who have felt the need for


1225
1:50:21,19 --> 1:50:27,639
good reasons, for evidence, for argument,
better that you should take as your slogan


1226
1:50:27,639 --> 1:50:36,73
credo quia absurdum "I believe because it
is absurd." That's a far sure basis.


1227
1:50:36,73 --> 1:50:41,889
It's not an epistemologically respectable
one, but it's a psychologically far firmer


1228
1:50:41,889 --> 1:50:45,909
basis to believe in the existence of God.


1229
1:50:45,909 --> 1:50:52,8
You cannot accept that faith is reasonable,
but that doesn't stop you from believing.


1230
1:50:52,8 --> 1:50:58,82
Of course, those friends of mine who are devout
Christians, of whom I count a number of people


1231
1:50:58,82 --> 1:51:4,2
that Professor Craig mentioned tonight, and
even Professor Craig with whom I'm sure I


1232
1:51:4,2 --> 1:51:10,32
will have a friendly exchange after this debate
is over, (audience laughing) even Professor


1233
1:51:10,32 --> 1:51:19,949
Craig I'm sure will tell you that that is,
in many ways, the firmest basis for commitment


1234
1:51:19,949 --> 1:51:26,3
to Jesus, faith and not reason.
Thank you.


1235
1:51:26,3 --> 1:51:40,38
Dr. Miller: Well, this concludes the debate
portion of tonight's event.


1236
1:51:40,38 --> 1:51:43,88
Please give our debaters a hand for very spirited
debate.


1237
1:51:43,88 --> 1:51:46,38
(Audience clapping)


1238
1:51:46,38 --> 1:51:53,889
Now they're hugging; now we're friends.


1239
1:51:53,889 --> 1:52:2,989
Dr. Rosenberg: So, I said to Bill, "Now you
know how the presidential candidates feel


1240
1:52:2,989 --> 1:52:5,53
right after their debate".
(Laughing).


1241
1:52:5,53 --> 1:52:11,31
Dr. Miller: It will go on in the form of a
book Is Faith in God Reasonable.


1242
1:52:11,31 --> 1:52:18,3
For our next aspect of tonight's event we
begin the question and answer period for our


1243
1:52:18,3 --> 1:52:20,949
live ...
we have three different elements of this.


1244
1:52:20,949 --> 1:52:23,929
Let me explain this.
For our live Purdue audience, if you've got


1245
1:52:23,929 --> 1:52:27,119
a probing question, please approach the microphones
at the front.


1246
1:52:27,119 --> 1:52:33,44
If I can have our microphone bouncers, they
are evil microphone bouncers stand.


1247
1:52:33,44 --> 1:52:36,3
If you've got a question for Professor Craig,
line up here.


1248
1:52:36,3 --> 1:52:40,869
If you've got a question for Professor Rosenberg,
please line up over here.


1249
1:52:40,869 --> 1:52:46,23
Ensure that the questions are well thought
out, are concise, and you will not be giving


1250
1:52:46,23 --> 1:52:52,139
a lecture yourself.
Then as soon as you asked your question, unless


1251
1:52:52,139 --> 1:52:59,8
there is a followup from the debater asking
you to clarify, then please have a sit.


1252
1:52:59,8 --> 1:53:9,199
I will ask the debaters to limit their responses
to two minutes and then they may exchange


1253
1:53:9,199 --> 1:53:15,219
words over those responses briefly.
After the ...


1254
1:53:15,219 --> 1:53:20,6
while the Q&A is going on, let me ask the
judges to write up their conclusions and you


1255
1:53:20,6 --> 1:53:25,46
as the audience, please fill out those comment
cards we gave to you, those response cards,


1256
1:53:25,46 --> 1:53:29,159
now is the time to decide who you think won
the debate.


1257
1:53:29,159 --> 1:53:33,76
After the Q&A terminates, we will announce
all voting results, our judges, our Purdue


1258
1:53:33,76 --> 1:53:39,9
audience, and all who respond online so please
pass your cards as soon as you get that filled


1259
1:53:39,9 --> 1:53:44,179
out like within the next 15 seconds, past
it to the inside isles.


1260
1:53:44,179 --> 1:53:50,55
And volunteers, now is the time for you to
come forward with buckets and begin collecting


1261
1:53:50,55 --> 1:53:54,58
in a couple of seconds those cards.


1262
1:53:54,58 --> 1:54:1,469
For our 10,000 plus listening to this online
and around the world, you can vote, you can


1263
1:54:1,469 --> 1:54:4,96
submit a question.
If you're in front of a computer you'll see


1264
1:54:4,96 --> 1:54:10,949
the vote link above the player and the submit
question to the right of your screen.


1265
1:54:10,949 --> 1:54:14,84
Voting online will close in 20 minutes, so
do it now.


1266
1:54:14,84 --> 1:54:24,76
If you are viewing with a group, visit www.biola.edu/debate
from your Smart Phone to submit a question


1267
1:54:24,76 --> 1:54:29,83
and a runner will bring me questions submitted
from the website for our debaters.


1268
1:54:29,83 --> 1:54:35,65
Now, let's begin the debate.
We will take a question beginning over on


1269
1:54:35,65 --> 1:54:42,719
this side from someone for Dr. Craig, do it
again over here for Dr. Rosenberg, once more


1270
1:54:42,719 --> 1:54:48,6
for Dr. Craig, once more for Dr. Rosenberg
and then we will take one online from somewhere


1271
1:54:48,6 --> 1:54:50,389
across our web.


1272
1:54:50,389 --> 1:54:56,83
So, if I can have it a little bit quiet please
in the audience, please fill out those forms


1273
1:54:56,83 --> 1:55:3,19
but maintain relative quiet so that we can
continue with this next session.


1274
1:55:3,19 --> 1:55:9,73
All right, first question for Dr. Craig, go
ahead.


1275
1:55:9,73 --> 1:55:14,71
Speaker 1: In your published works, you've
talked about something that's conspicuously


1276
1:55:14,71 --> 1:55:20,33
missing from this debate; the relation between
reason and faith.


1277
1:55:20,33 --> 1:55:25,75
For example, in Reasonable Faith you point
out that when faith is in conflict with the


1278
1:55:25,75 --> 1:55:31,57
evidence and argument, it's the latter rather
than the former that should be disregarded.


1279
1:55:31,57 --> 1:55:37,179
On the face of it, that seems like to mount
nothing less than an endorsement of confirmation


1280
1:55:37,179 --> 1:55:40,219
bias.
It should go without saying, that an open-armed


1281
1:55:40,219 --> 1:55:46,59
embrace of conservation...confirmation bias
is nothing reasonable at all.


1282
1:55:46,59 --> 1:55:55,13
However, you, in other areas have expounded
upon this and taking what might be considered


1283
1:55:55,13 --> 1:56:1,53
a personal epistemological code and to something
of a normative claim.


1284
1:56:1,53 --> 1:56:9,679
The example I have in mind is when you're
asked about, "How Christians should respond


1285
1:56:9,679 --> 1:56:17,75
to their doubts?" You gave the same answer
but with an explanation and that's a kicker.


1286
1:56:17,75 --> 1:56:18,929
You posited that...


1287
1:56:18,929 --> 1:56:21,32
Dr. Miller: Can you be concise and just ask
your question?


1288
1:56:21,32 --> 1:56:29,9
Speaker 1: I'm trying to get to it.
What you effectively did...


1289
1:56:29,9 --> 1:56:35,15
skipping ahead because the moderator ...
was posit instead of the possibility of the


1290
1:56:35,15 --> 1:56:40,1
Cartesian demon...
the actuality of the Cartesian demon...


1291
1:56:40,1 --> 1:56:46,949
So as you pointed out Hume...
that Descartes didn't take the radical skepticism


1292
1:56:46,949 --> 1:56:54,449
far enough and introspection, you don't get
a unified entity having these perceptions,


1293
1:56:54,449 --> 1:57:0,469
you only get the perceptions.
On your framework, how do you and, since it


1294
1:57:0,469 --> 1:57:6,46
was a normative claim, all other Christians
escape this downward spiral of radical skepticism?


1295
1:57:6,46 --> 1:57:10,98
Dr. Miller: Go ahead and have a seat thanks
for the question.


1296
1:57:10,98 --> 1:57:19,38
Dr. Craig: In tonight's debate I took the
word faith to mean the same thing as believe.


1297
1:57:19,38 --> 1:57:23,699
Faith in God, believe in God.
Let us say believe that God exists, but you're


1298
1:57:23,699 --> 1:57:28,85
quite right in saying there's another understanding
of faith that is more than just propositional


1299
1:57:28,85 --> 1:57:32,33
belief.
It would be the idea of trusting in someone,


1300
1:57:32,33 --> 1:57:38,699
committing one's life to someone.
And I would say that, that kind of faith would


1301
1:57:38,699 --> 1:57:45,79
be subsequent to propositional belief.
You first believe that God exists, and then


1302
1:57:45,79 --> 1:57:49,51
you can believe in God, and put your faith
in him.


1303
1:57:49,51 --> 1:57:54,469
Now in the chapter that you were speaking
of in Reasonable Faith, when I'm speaking


1304
1:57:54,469 --> 1:58:3,38
of faith there, I am talking about...
how do we know the propositional truths of


1305
1:58:3,38 --> 1:58:8,3
the Christian faith like that God exists or
that God loves me and so forth.


1306
1:58:8,3 --> 1:58:15,32
What I was suggesting there is that in addition
to external arguments and evidence, there


1307
1:58:15,32 --> 1:58:24,1
is also this immediate testimony of God himself
to one that gives you in a properly basic


1308
1:58:24,1 --> 1:58:30,38
way, a knowledge of God's existence and the
great truths of the gospel.


1309
1:58:30,38 --> 1:58:36,199
That was my eighth point in tonight's debate
that God can be personally known and experienced.


1310
1:58:36,199 --> 1:58:42,619
And I said this isn't an argument rather it's
suggesting that just as we have properly basic


1311
1:58:42,619 --> 1:58:49,429
beliefs like the belief in the reality of
the external world, or the reality, the past,


1312
1:58:49,429 --> 1:58:54,719
so belief in God could be a properly basic
belief grounded in the inner witness of the


1313
1:58:54,719 --> 1:58:58,21
Holy Spirit.
So, this isn't some kind of fideism or leap


1314
1:58:58,21 --> 1:59:5,34
in the dark sort of thing it's saying that,
God himself can give a person a knowledge


1315
1:59:5,34 --> 1:59:10,58
of his existence that is independent of argument
and evidence.


1316
1:59:10,58 --> 1:59:16,219
And this is a view that's widely defended
today especially by Alvin Plantinga and his


1317
1:59:16,219 --> 1:59:21,1
book Warranted Christian Belief.
And I think he shown that there aren't any


1318
1:59:21,1 --> 1:59:25,48
philosophical objections to this point of
view.


1319
1:59:25,48 --> 1:59:28,699
It's a perfectly coherent religious epistemology.


1320
1:59:28,699 --> 1:59:35,81
Dr. Miller: All right, question for Dr. Rosenberg.
Go ahead.


1321
1:59:35,81 --> 1:59:43,409
Speaker 2: Dr. Rosenberg, having taught chemistry
for 40 years and having a degree from a major


1322
1:59:43,409 --> 1:59:47,6
big ten university in chemistry.
I'm very interested if you could go a little


1323
1:59:47,6 --> 1:59:54,969
bit into more detail why the decay of Uranium
238 violates any of the principles that Dr.


1324
1:59:54,969 --> 2:0:1,63
Craig gave for the existence of God? (Audience
clapping)


1325
2:0:1,63 --> 2:0:9,909
Dr. Rosenberg: Thanks, it's a nice question
because it gives me a chance to put this case


1326
2:0:9,909 --> 2:0:16,81
before everybody a little more clearly.
So, you've got two uranium atoms, same number


1327
2:0:16,81 --> 2:0:22,3
of neutrons, same number of protons, same
number of electrons; all of them at the same


1328
2:0:22,3 --> 2:0:29,8
quantum states and quantum energy levels.
And they're not merely as identical as two


1329
2:0:29,8 --> 2:0:33,85
peas in a pod.
They're much more identical than that in all


1330
2:0:33,85 --> 2:0:36,19
of their physical properties.


1331
2:0:36,19 --> 2:0:43,61
At a certain moment, one of them emits and
the other does not emit an alpha particle,


1332
2:0:43,61 --> 2:0:55,78
that is to say, the nucleus of a helium atom.
The difference between these two atoms is


1333
2:0:55,78 --> 2:1:1,1
that one of them emitted and the other didn't.
Now if every event has to have a cause, if


1334
2:1:1,1 --> 2:1:5,67
everything that comes into existence has to
have a cause of it's coming into existence;


1335
2:1:5,67 --> 2:1:11,929
then there's got to be some difference between
the two atoms in virtue of which one of them


1336
2:1:11,929 --> 2:1:17,869
emitted an alpha particle and the other didn't;
but quantum mechanics tells us and all the


1337
2:1:17,869 --> 2:1:24,219
experimental evidence which confirms it to
12 decimal places tells us there is no difference,


1338
2:1:24,219 --> 2:1:26,969
end of story.


1339
2:1:26,969 --> 2:1:33,369
There is an event without a cause.
There is no causally relevant difference between


1340
2:1:33,369 --> 2:1:39,81
the two molecules in virtue of which one emitted
an alpha particle and the other didn't.


1341
2:1:39,81 --> 2:1:47,739
Dr. Craig: Well, that's not the end of the
story.


1342
2:1:47,739 --> 2:1:53,75
There are at least 10 different physical interpretations
of quantum mechanics.


1343
2:1:53,75 --> 2:1:59,83
Some of these are fully deterministic and
nobody knows which one of this is true.


1344
2:1:59,83 --> 2:2:6,639
Victor Stenger who is atheistic physicist
says this in his book.


1345
2:2:6,639 --> 2:2:12,65
He says, "Other viable interpretations of
quantum mechanics remain with no consensus


1346
2:2:12,65 --> 2:2:15,53
on which, if any of them is the correct one."


1347
2:2:15,53 --> 2:2:21,71
So, He says, "We have to remain open to the
possibility that causes may someday be found


1348
2:2:21,71 --> 2:2:27,21
for such phenomena." There are deterministic
interpretations of quantum mechanics that


1349
2:2:27,21 --> 2:2:31,58
may well be correct.
In any event, my argument never appealed to


1350
2:2:31,58 --> 2:2:37,67
the premise that every event has a cause.
It was deliberately formulated in such a way


1351
2:2:37,67 --> 2:2:41,59
as to allow for quantum indeterminacy.


1352
2:2:41,59 --> 2:2:46,53
Without prejudicing the issue, my argument
is that if the universe began to exist, had


1353
2:2:46,53 --> 2:2:50,659
an absolute beginning then the universe has
a transcendent cause.


1354
2:2:50,659 --> 2:2:55,949
And quantum mechanics is simply irrelevant
to that, because we're talking about an absolute


1355
2:2:55,949 --> 2:3:1,76
beginning of space and time, matter and energy.
There's nothing in physics that would explain


1356
2:3:1,76 --> 2:3:3,7
how being comes from non-being.


1357
2:3:3,7 --> 2:3:8,3
Dr. Rosenberg: I need to make a short response
to that with your permission.


1358
2:3:8,3 --> 2:3:11,869
This is not an issue about the interpretation
of quantum mechanics.


1359
2:3:11,869 --> 2:3:16,73
I happen to think that among the interpretations
of quantum mechanics, the deterministic ...


1360
2:3:16,73 --> 2:3:19,86
some of the deterministic ones are more plausible
than others.


1361
2:3:19,86 --> 2:3:24,78
This is a matter of experimental physics.
This is a matter of a fact about the nature


1362
2:3:24,78 --> 2:3:26,54
of reality.


1363
2:3:26,54 --> 2:3:33,46
And it also seems to me clear that, in so
far as we have here, good evidence that things


1364
2:3:33,46 --> 2:3:40,1
can happen with no cause at all, it follows
that therefore the universe can come into


1365
2:3:40,1 --> 2:3:46,46
existence with no cause at all.
And indeed, that's what the best guesses of


1366
2:3:46,46 --> 2:3:50,77
contemporary physical theorists is.


1367
2:3:50,77 --> 2:3:59,76
Dr. Miller: Alright, for Dr. Craig.


1368
2:3:59,76 --> 2:4:7,889
Speaker 3: I would like to ask you about your
use of the existence of "objective morality"


1369
2:4:7,889 --> 2:4:14,679
as an argument.
Because, there are differences due to society


1370
2:4:14,679 --> 2:4:20,9
or religious beliefs that lead to people having
different moralities such as like the practice


1371
2:4:20,9 --> 2:4:27,51
of Sharia Law or the death penalty.
So, how can ...


1372
2:4:27,51 --> 2:4:34,739
if God gave us, like as humanity objective
morality, then why do we have such conflicting


1373
2:4:34,739 --> 2:4:37,949
views of morality and what is right and wrong?


1374
2:4:37,949 --> 2:4:44,26
Dr. Craig: The question you're raising is
not a question about moral ontology, that


1375
2:4:44,26 --> 2:4:48,719
is to say, the reality or the foundation of
moral values.


1376
2:4:48,719 --> 2:4:54,29
Your question is about moral epistemology
and that is how do we come to know moral values


1377
2:4:54,29 --> 2:5:1,9
and duties? It's no part of my case to say
that moral questions are always easy.


1378
2:5:1,9 --> 2:5:6,599
Certainly there are areas of gray where good
people will disagree and will differ.


1379
2:5:6,599 --> 2:5:12,73
It's not always easy to discern what is right
or what is wrong in certain situations.


1380
2:5:12,73 --> 2:5:20,26
But, what I am saying is that we do have in
moral experience, a very clear grasp of cases


1381
2:5:20,26 --> 2:5:28,699
where there are clearly objective moral values
and objective duties or obligations and prohibitions.


1382
2:5:28,699 --> 2:5:34,429
And so, by no means, am I suggesting that
all of these cases are clear, all you need


1383
2:5:34,429 --> 2:5:40,699
is a few really, any and you've got to then
explain what is the ontological foundation


1384
2:5:40,699 --> 2:5:44,32
in reality for these moral values.


1385
2:5:44,32 --> 2:5:50,79
Dr. Miller: No sorry, no follow-up questions.
Thank you.


1386
2:5:50,79 --> 2:5:53,7
All right, for Dr. Rosenberg.


1387
2:5:53,7 --> 2:6:0,13
Speaker 4: Yes doctor, so with a lot of debates
such as this, the question becomes an argument


1388
2:6:0,13 --> 2:6:3,9
of looking at the same evidence and coming
up with different conclusions.


1389
2:6:3,9 --> 2:6:9,67
As a result of this, people become I supposed
heated in this debates, and so there is certain


1390
2:6:9,67 --> 2:6:11,26
level of arrogance on both sides.


1391
2:6:11,26 --> 2:6:19,55
This is more of a question to both of you.
How is it that you deal with this sort of


1392
2:6:19,55 --> 2:6:22,389
issue where you a lot of the arguments made
by you ...


1393
2:6:22,389 --> 2:6:25,909
and I'm an atheist so I'm with you on a lot
of them ...


1394
2:6:25,909 --> 2:6:31,599
a lot of them posit a sort of attack on the
other viewpoint.


1395
2:6:31,599 --> 2:6:35,31
As a result, the other person becomes very
defensive and attacks your view point.


1396
2:6:35,31 --> 2:6:40,429
How is it that both of you help address and
calm that issue?


1397
2:6:40,429 --> 2:6:47,17
Dr. Rosenberg: I have no idea.
(Audience laughing).


1398
2:6:47,17 --> 2:6:55,599
I suppose, as I said at the beginning, that
I don't think that debate format the eristic


1399
2:6:55,599 --> 2:7:3,599
context of prosecutorial and defense attorneys
in a adversarial relationship is the right


1400
2:7:3,599 --> 2:7:8,55
venue under which to purse philosophical and
theological inquiry.


1401
2:7:8,55 --> 2:7:12,7
In fact, I'm very confident that it isn't.


1402
2:7:12,7 --> 2:7:18,0
I have spent a lot of time in my life with
Peter van Inwagen.


1403
2:7:18,0 --> 2:7:21,23
And we have often argued about issues like
this ...


1404
2:7:21,23 --> 2:7:23,969
discussed issues like this, tried to find
out ...


1405
2:7:23,969 --> 2:7:29,19
to identify where are differences are and
how we might adjudicate them.


1406
2:7:29,19 --> 2:7:33,75
It's a difficult process; it's a process that's
been going on in philosophy and rational theology


1407
2:7:33,75 --> 2:7:43,13
for at least 2,400 years in the West.
It certainly hasn't attained consensus, but


1408
2:7:43,13 --> 2:7:46,19
at its best it's not controversialist.


1409
2:7:46,19 --> 2:7:53,369
It's unfortunate that some fora because they
make for entertainment or sell books and CDs


1410
2:7:53,369 --> 2:8:3,179
and stuff like that, emerge in which such
debates sharpen controversies, but they are


1411
2:8:3,179 --> 2:8:10,96
not the ideal indeed, they're not even satisfactory
venues for pursuing these questions.


1412
2:8:10,96 --> 2:8:19,88
Dr. Craig: I'm glad for the question, because
I think while we may be passionate about our


1413
2:8:19,88 --> 2:8:25,26
arguments and point of view, I think it's
extremely important that these kinds of debates


1414
2:8:25,26 --> 2:8:31,349
be conducted with civility, and charity, and
honesty.


1415
2:8:31,349 --> 2:8:39,239
I think you try to represent your opponent's
point of view fairly, you prepare by reading


1416
2:8:39,239 --> 2:8:45,889
his work carefully, and pointing out the areas
of disagreement, but you do so in a way that


1417
2:8:45,889 --> 2:8:53,719
is gentlemanly and civil without personal
attacks upon character.


1418
2:8:53,719 --> 2:8:59,599
I think that these kinds of forums are very
valuable that doesn't mean they're the only


1419
2:8:59,599 --> 2:9:2,949
kind of forum.
Obviously he and I both publish in professional


1420
2:9:2,949 --> 2:9:9,449
journals, we read papers at professional conferences,
publish books, but most of you students will


1421
2:9:9,449 --> 2:9:14,53
never read a professional philosophy journal
or attend a professional conference.


1422
2:9:14,53 --> 2:9:22,489
These debates are important as a way of getting
this information disseminated to a wider public


1423
2:9:22,489 --> 2:9:29,369
in a way that is passionate and firm, but
it's civil and it's an academic exchange;


1424
2:9:29,369 --> 2:9:32,28
these are as old as the Middle Ages.
Back in the Middle Ages they used to have


1425
2:9:32,28 --> 2:9:38,969
what they call Quaestionis Disputatis, "Disputed
Questions" of theology.


1426
2:9:38,969 --> 2:9:41,99
We're continuing a long tradition,


1427
2:9:41,99 --> 2:9:47,179
I think of having a good solid academic debate
over these issues and I hope that people would


1428
2:9:47,179 --> 2:9:53,26
be stimulated by what said tonight to go out
and look further and read, and investigate,


1429
2:9:53,26 --> 2:9:58,989
and think harder about these, maybe take some
classes in philosophy, or theology, or New


1430
2:9:58,989 --> 2:10:3,869
Testament studies about these matters.
I'm firmly committed to the value of these


1431
2:10:3,869 --> 2:10:6,679
kinds of forum on university campuses.


1432
2:10:6,679 --> 2:10:12,889
I'm glad Dr. Rosenberg despite his scruples
agreed to participate tonight.


1433
2:10:12,889 --> 2:10:16,349
(Audience clapping)


1434
2:10:16,349 --> 2:10:24,409
Dr. Miller: Given that we have a ton of questions
here and we've got probably twice as many


1435
2:10:24,409 --> 2:10:29,36
people watching live stream.
In fairness, I'm going to ask one of each


1436
2:10:29,36 --> 2:10:34,32
of our debaters from within the United States
and then one with outside of the United States.


1437
2:10:34,32 --> 2:10:42,54
So, first of all, Dr. Craig from Anthony in
Newburyport, Massachusetts: With respect to


1438
2:10:42,54 --> 2:10:47,869
the fine-tuning of the theological argument,
aren't you presupposing atheism since God


1439
2:10:47,869 --> 2:10:50,929
could have made the universal without needing
to have it fine-tuned?


1440
2:10:50,929 --> 2:11:1,2
Dr. Craig: The fine-tuning argument doesn't
presuppose anything about how God could have


1441
2:11:1,2 --> 2:11:7,0
done it in the sense that he could have created
a world say of just spirit beings without


1442
2:11:7,0 --> 2:11:14,92
any physical beings at all; but fine-tuning
simply means that the fundamental constants


1443
2:11:14,92 --> 2:11:23,58
and quantities in the universe that are necessary
for life, fall into an extraordinarily narrow


1444
2:11:23,58 --> 2:11:30,3
range of values; an infinitesimal range almost.
Such that if these values were to be altered


1445
2:11:30,3 --> 2:11:35,76
by even a hair's breadth or less rather, the
balance would be upset and life could not


1446
2:11:35,76 --> 2:11:41,98
exist in a universe governed by these laws.
And so, that's all the debate is about.


1447
2:11:41,98 --> 2:11:47,4
It's not about whether God could have created
other universes with other laws of nature


1448
2:11:47,4 --> 2:11:50,119
that weren't fine-tuned.
It's about whether or not ...


1449
2:11:50,119 --> 2:12:0,42
or what is the best explanation for the fine-tuning
of the universe that characterizes this univ...


1450
2:12:0,42 --> 2:12:4,63
the universe we live in.
And, I think that the best explanation is


1451
2:12:4,63 --> 2:12:10,679
intelligent design.
Physical necessity, and chance just won't


1452
2:12:10,679 --> 2:12:13,699
offer plausible accounts of this fact.


1453
2:12:13,699 --> 2:12:22,31
Dr. Miller: Okay, one for Dr. Rosenberg and
this one I had to take this.


1454
2:12:22,31 --> 2:12:30,739
This is kind of funny because of this Purdue
audience this is from IU.


1455
2:12:30,739 --> 2:12:39,349
They are actually watching with a Christian
Ministry and a non-theist campus group together.


1456
2:12:39,349 --> 2:12:47,25
So, Dr. Rosenberg, and there's no name on
this, it's the whole group they all decided


1457
2:12:47,25 --> 2:12:53,619
unanimously apparently ...
how can the most basic moral values be universal


1458
2:12:53,619 --> 2:12:57,92
if they are determined by natural selection?


1459
2:12:57,92 --> 2:13:5,639
Dr. Rosenberg: That's a question for evolutionary
anthropology.


1460
2:13:5,639 --> 2:13:12,28
That is, it's the question ...
assume that there are set of moral norms,


1461
2:13:12,28 --> 2:13:16,21
behaviors and values, that are universal that
are...


1462
2:13:16,21 --> 2:13:23,429
that obtain in every culture, how could that
happen? Well, first of all, the explanandum,


1463
2:13:23,429 --> 2:13:27,929
the proposition describing what is to be explained
of course is false.


1464
2:13:27,929 --> 2:13:35,199
And therefore it's difficult to satisfy the
request for an explanation.


1465
2:13:35,199 --> 2:13:39,55
It's not the case that there are universal
moral values.


1466
2:13:39,55 --> 2:13:46,139
The moral values differ in...
on our earth and have overtime owing to important


1467
2:13:46,139 --> 2:13:51,989
ecological differences between the communities
that have emerged at various times and various


1468
2:13:51,989 --> 2:13:58,5
places on our planet but now let's just slightly
change the question to ...


1469
2:13:58,5 --> 2:14:7,38
in so far as there is a commonality among
all human groups in regard to the moral norms


1470
2:14:7,38 --> 2:14:14,0
that they adopt, how could this have emerged
as a result of a process of blind variation


1471
2:14:14,0 --> 2:14:16,369
and natural selection?


1472
2:14:16,369 --> 2:14:26,199
So for example, human cooperation, the commitment
to fairness and to equality, to reciprocity,


1473
2:14:26,199 --> 2:14:32,23
these are almost all universal.
There's only a very small number of societies


1474
2:14:32,23 --> 2:14:38,949
which spurn such moral norms.
And why should they have emerged? It's a remarkable


1475
2:14:38,949 --> 2:14:47,94
fact of recent work by evolutionary game theorists
and evolutionary anthropologists and others


1476
2:14:47,94 --> 2:14:55,51
that it turns out that cooperation, a commitment
to fairness and to equality and to reciprocity,


1477
2:14:55,51 --> 2:15:0,63
turn out for creatures like us who found ourselves
at the bottom of the food chain on the African


1478
2:15:0,63 --> 2:15:8,32
savanna 200,000 years ago; to be absolutely
required for our survival.


1479
2:15:8,32 --> 2:15:14,71
In fact, it's because we glommed on by pure
blind variation, a natural selection to this


1480
2:15:14,71 --> 2:15:20,17
set of norms of cooperation that we manage
to climb up the food chain so that within


1481
2:15:20,17 --> 2:15:26,389
a 100,000 years; we were at the top of the
food chain everywhere on the planet.


1482
2:15:26,389 --> 2:15:33,699
Our own persistence over that subsequent hundred
thousand year period; and our expansion out


1483
2:15:33,699 --> 2:15:43,81
of Africa is largely due to the natural selection
for those almost universal norms of cooperation.


1484
2:15:43,81 --> 2:15:45,82
And it's a wonderful thing about us.


1485
2:15:45,82 --> 2:15:52,5
Dr. Craig: I would just say I think the question
isn't the universality of these norms but


1486
2:15:52,5 --> 2:15:54,179
their objectivity.


1487
2:15:54,179 --> 2:15:57,4
Dr. Miller: Okay.


1488
2:15:57,4 --> 2:15:59,54
(Audience laughing)


1489
2:15:59,54 --> 2:16:9,69
Dr. Miller: Dr. Craig, this is from Tibor
in Town Zilina Slovakia ...


1490
2:16:9,69 --> 2:16:14,76
Slovakia.
If the Christian faith is from a realm beyond


1491
2:16:14,76 --> 2:16:18,869
or above reason, like Pauline, peace surpassing
understanding...?


1492
2:16:18,869 --> 2:16:19,55
Dr. Craig: It's from Slovakia?


1493
2:16:19,55 --> 2:16:21,55
Could you say that again? I didn't catch it.


1494
2:16:21,55 --> 2:16:27,849
Dr. Miller: If the Christian ...
if the Christian faith is from a realm "beyond


1495
2:16:27,849 --> 2:16:35,989
or above reason," like Pauline "Peace surpassing
understanding," then how can we even anchor


1496
2:16:35,989 --> 2:16:40,919
such a topic as the reasonableness of believing
in God?


1497
2:16:40,919 --> 2:16:51,839
Dr. Craig: God, I would say is beyond human
comprehension in the sense that we cannot


1498
2:16:51,839 --> 2:17:3,39
grasp fully God's greatness and majesty.
He is not able to be comprehended in that


1499
2:17:3,39 --> 2:17:9,699
universal sense, but that doesn't in anyway
imply that we get no elements of truth about


1500
2:17:9,699 --> 2:17:9,769
God.


1501
2:17:9,769 --> 2:17:14,199
I would say that in fact, God is the ultimate
rational being.


1502
2:17:14,199 --> 2:17:19,51
He is the ultimate rational mind and we as
finite minds, made in His image, are able


1503
2:17:19,51 --> 2:17:25,149
to know a great deal of truth and a great
deal about Him even if such knowledge is not


1504
2:17:25,149 --> 2:17:26,469
exhaustive.


1505
2:17:26,469 --> 2:17:33,689
Dr. Miller: Tibori you can go to sleep now
because it's late there.


1506
2:17:33,689 --> 2:17:36,499
(Audience laughing)


1507
2:17:36,499 --> 2:17:47,919
Okay, Dr. Rosenberg, from Sarah in Seoul,
South Korea: "You said God chose it, whatever


1508
2:17:47,919 --> 2:17:55,149
"it" may be, because it was "morally right."
Where does the standard for morally right


1509
2:17:55,149 --> 2:17:58,869
and wrong comes from and what is the logical
basis for this order?


1510
2:17:58,869 --> 2:18:6,129
Dr. Rosenberg: Well, I don't have the slightest
idea, but what I do know is that God's command


1511
2:18:6,129 --> 2:18:11,459
cannot be such a basis.
Assume God exists, assume He commanded us


1512
2:18:11,459 --> 2:18:18,469
to obey certain moral norms.
The question becomes are those the right moral


1513
2:18:18,469 --> 2:18:25,389
norms simply because He commanded them, holding
the threat of hell to our heads or did He


1514
2:18:25,389 --> 2:18:30,59
command them in his wisdom and goodness because
they are the moral right ones?


1515
2:18:30,59 --> 2:18:35,169
The answer that we all agreed to is the latter
that he chose them for us because there are


1516
2:18:35,169 --> 2:18:40,789
the morally right ones and it can't be rocket
science what makes them morally right; it's


1517
2:18:40,789 --> 2:18:48,349
not like interpretation of quantum mechanics.
We all know what makes the morally right values


1518
2:18:48,349 --> 2:18:54,839
morally right.
It's not merely the fact that God chose them.


1519
2:18:54,839 --> 2:18:58,639
He chose them because they were the moral
right ones.


1520
2:18:58,639 --> 2:19:8,3
And therefore you cannot argue for God's existence
from the existence of morally right norms,


1521
2:19:8,3 --> 2:19:16,189
but what the origin, what the basis of moral
objectivity is, is not a question to which


1522
2:19:16,189 --> 2:19:21,979
I have at this time a satisfactory answer.
Of course as I ...


1523
2:19:21,979 --> 2:19:27,129
and it pains to point out, that's not a material
question in this discussion.


1524
2:19:27,129 --> 2:19:35,869
Dr. Craig: I think this is one of the most
powerful arguments for the existence of God


1525
2:19:35,869 --> 2:19:41,69
and rooting moral values and duties in God
can take either two forms.


1526
2:19:41,69 --> 2:19:47,1
Dr. Rosenberg alluded to one form which is
called volunteerism, which is what Ockham


1527
2:19:47,1 --> 2:19:54,169
held and that is that God just makes up moral
duties and responsibilities for.


1528
2:19:54,169 --> 2:19:59,669
They're based in His will, but that's not
the majority mainstream Christian position.


1529
2:19:59,669 --> 2:20:4,52
Volunteerism is not the usual way divine command
morality works.


1530
2:20:4,52 --> 2:20:10,659
The majority position would be that God Himself
is what Plato called the good.


1531
2:20:10,659 --> 2:20:17,659
God himself is the paradigm of goodness.
His commands are reflections of his own character,


1532
2:20:17,659 --> 2:20:22,829
so it's not that God commands things because
they're right independently of Him, that there's


1533
2:20:22,829 --> 2:20:30,43
some good outside of God to which he is subservient,
rather God is the good and His commandments


1534
2:20:30,43 --> 2:20:33,659
are reflections of that good character toward
us.


1535
2:20:33,659 --> 2:20:38,449
And so, they're not arbitrary but neither
are they based on something independent of


1536
2:20:38,449 --> 2:20:42,869
God.
I think this gives a very credible foundation


1537
2:20:42,869 --> 2:20:50,5
for moral obligation and prohibition as well
as moral value which the atheist cannot provide.


1538
2:20:50,5 --> 2:20:54,289
Dr. Rosenberg: And I think it's just the ...
"the assertion that God is good because God


1539
2:20:54,289 --> 2:21:2,55
is good" without adding any content to found,
to ground, to substantiate the claim.


1540
2:21:2,55 --> 2:21:6,279
So, God...
God's goodness cannot consist in his obeying


1541
2:21:6,279 --> 2:21:11,739
his own moral norms because God could not
disobey them.


1542
2:21:11,739 --> 2:21:18,6
It makes no sense to say that his goodness
consist in his obeying his own moral norms,


1543
2:21:18,6 --> 2:21:22,939
not to mention that in the Old and New Testament,
he doesn't do it very often, but that's another


1544
2:21:22,939 --> 2:21:23,459
matter.


1545
2:21:23,459 --> 2:21:30,119
The real problem is if you assert that it's
God's goodness in which the foundation of


1546
2:21:30,119 --> 2:21:34,699
the moral norms consists, then you have to
go on and say unless you think it's like quantum


1547
2:21:34,699 --> 2:21:36,579
mechanics, what is that goodness consists
in.


1548
2:21:36,579 --> 2:21:41,449
If you simply say, "It's God's goodness because
he is good", that's not an answer to the question.


1549
2:21:41,449 --> 2:21:49,1
We need some content to the claim that his
goodness grounds the objectivity, the rightness;


1550
2:21:49,1 --> 2:21:54,26
the correctness of the moral norms, and merely
saying, "He's good" over and over again doesn't


1551
2:21:54,26 --> 2:21:58,959
do it.
This is the open question argument in meta-ethics


1552
2:21:58,959 --> 2:22:6,589
and it dogs divine command theory just as
fully as it dogs as it daunts utilitarianism,


1553
2:22:6,589 --> 2:22:12,109
or Kant, or social contract theory, or ideal
observer ethics.


1554
2:22:12,109 --> 2:22:17,239
Dr. Craig: Yes, I don't think that that's
an insuperable problem.


1555
2:22:17,239 --> 2:22:20,689
God by his very nature is the greatest conceivable
being.


1556
2:22:20,689 --> 2:22:26,229
He is a being that is worthy of worship and
only a being which is perfect goodness can


1557
2:22:26,229 --> 2:22:31,869
be worthy of worship, and the greatest conceivable
being would not simply be good by conforming


1558
2:22:31,869 --> 2:22:35,739
to some other standard.
He would be the paradigm of goodness.


1559
2:22:35,739 --> 2:22:42,979
He would be like the old meter bar in Paris,
which defined what a meter was not by conforming


1560
2:22:42,979 --> 2:22:47,359
to some abstract length, but by being the
paradigm of what a meter is.


1561
2:22:47,359 --> 2:22:53,22
It makes no sense to ask, "Why is the meter
bar a meter long?" It is the paradigm for


1562
2:22:53,22 --> 2:22:54,499
what that is.


1563
2:22:54,499 --> 2:23:0,539
Similarly God, I would say, as the greatest
conceivable being, a being worthy of worship


1564
2:23:0,539 --> 2:23:5,909
is the good and this is defined in terms that
of the character quality city has like compassion,


1565
2:23:5,909 --> 2:23:12,909
fairness, love, justice, and so forth.
It's not a contentless claim.


1566
2:23:12,909 --> 2:23:15,459
(Audience clapping)


1567
2:23:15,459 --> 2:23:23,119
Dr. Miller: Okay, I f I could have someone
bring up to me the results from the three


1568
2:23:23,119 --> 2:23:26,439
voting aspects.
We will continue to take questions for another


1569
2:23:26,439 --> 2:23:30,89
10 minutes here while they bring that up and
I will share with the audience the conclusions


1570
2:23:30,89 --> 2:23:32,989
of the people.


1571
2:23:32,989 --> 2:23:33,919
Over here for Dr. Craig.


1572
2:23:33,919 --> 2:23:41,279
Speaker 5: Yes Dr. Craig, I just want to know
how would you respond to Dr. Rosenberg's argument


1573
2:23:41,279 --> 2:23:47,64
in his concluding statement that science can
operate without having to account for God?


1574
2:23:47,64 --> 2:23:48,999
Dr. Craig: That science what?


1575
2:23:48,999 --> 2:23:53,3
Speaker 5: That science can operate without
having to account for God or taking account


1576
2:23:53,3 --> 2:23:53,899
for God?


1577
2:23:53,899 --> 2:23:56,6
Dr. Rosenberg: Yes, that God makes no predictive
contribution.


1578
2:23:56,6 --> 2:23:57,979
That God makes no predictive contribution.


1579
2:23:57,979 --> 2:23:58,609
Speaker 5: Yes, that's my question.


1580
2:23:58,609 --> 2:24:5,359
Dr. Craig: Yeah, I read his interview in the
campus newspaper this morning trying to get


1581
2:24:5,359 --> 2:24:10,35
some clues to what he might say this evening.
And I saw this argument about predictability


1582
2:24:10,35 --> 2:24:17,52
and here's what my thoughts on this are.
Predictability is just one way to test for


1583
2:24:17,52 --> 2:24:22,869
the truth of a scientific theory.
And it's not always useful.


1584
2:24:22,869 --> 2:24:27,97
Some theories for example are empirically
equivalent in their predictions.


1585
2:24:27,97 --> 2:24:32,72
For example I mentioned 10 different physical
interpretations of quantum mechanics which


1586
2:24:32,72 --> 2:24:36,239
are all empirically equivalent.
There are three different interpretations


1587
2:24:36,239 --> 2:24:41,68
of special relativity which are all empirically
equivalent and yet they're different, there


1588
2:24:41,68 --> 2:24:47,85
in in each one is a legitimate scientific
theory even though they can't be assessed


1589
2:24:47,85 --> 2:24:49,729
based on predictability.


1590
2:24:49,729 --> 2:24:57,229
Other factors then can come into play, things
like simplicity, plausibility, degree of 'ad


1591
2:24:57,229 --> 2:25:2,159
hocness', explanatory power.
These are other theoretical virtues besides


1592
2:25:2,159 --> 2:25:7,52
predictability that we can use in testing
a hypothesis.


1593
2:25:7,52 --> 2:25:14,22
Predictability is especially difficult to
apply when you're dealing with a free agent


1594
2:25:14,22 --> 2:25:21,909
rather than with impersonal mechanistic causes,
and particularly in God's case, how could


1595
2:25:21,909 --> 2:25:29,339
you predict what God would do? You could predict
perhaps if a universe exists then it would


1596
2:25:29,339 --> 2:25:35,789
be fine-tuned for our existence or that if
God created a universe, it would likely have


1597
2:25:35,789 --> 2:25:37,839
objective moral values and duties.


1598
2:25:37,839 --> 2:25:42,409
I think you could make that kind of prediction,
but how could you predict as a free agent


1599
2:25:42,409 --> 2:25:48,339
whether or not God would create a universe
at all? So, instead, I don't think what you


1600
2:25:48,339 --> 2:25:53,159
do is look for predictability.
You follow Quine's prescription.


1601
2:25:53,159 --> 2:25:59,339
Remember Quine said, if you could show the
indirect explanatory benefit of positing things


1602
2:25:59,339 --> 2:26:6,379
like a creator, then I would joyfully accord
them scientific status along with these other


1603
2:26:6,379 --> 2:26:9,89
entities like quarks and black holes.


1604
2:26:9,89 --> 2:26:17,749
And so, I would say that the...
theism has explanatory power to offer us.


1605
2:26:17,749 --> 2:26:24,68
For example fine-tuning is more probable on
theism than on naturalism.


1606
2:26:24,68 --> 2:26:31,819
States of intentionality are more probable
on theism than on naturalism or atheism.


1607
2:26:31,819 --> 2:26:37,319
Objective moral values and duties are more
probable on theism than on naturalism.


1608
2:26:37,319 --> 2:26:42,689
The resurrection of Jesus is more probable
on theism than on naturalism.


1609
2:26:42,689 --> 2:26:54,169
So, in all of these ways, I think theism is
an explanatorily beneficial hypothesis that


1610
2:26:54,169 --> 2:27:1,879
explains a wide range of the data of the human
experience which atheism cannot explain.


1611
2:27:1,879 --> 2:27:6,26
Speaker 5: Sounds pretty ad hoc to me.
(Laughs).


1612
2:27:6,26 --> 2:27:9,89
Dr. Miller: For Dr. Rosenberg.


1613
2:27:9,89 --> 2:27:15,739
Speaker 6: In your closing argument, you're
saying that science is the only way to be


1614
2:27:15,739 --> 2:27:19,409
reasonable.
Wouldn't that make history and personal experiences


1615
2:27:19,409 --> 2:27:23,489
unreasonable because they're not repeatable
and also everyone in this room because we're


1616
2:27:23,489 --> 2:27:25,199
not repeatable scientifically?


1617
2:27:25,199 --> 2:27:27,669
Dr. Rosenberg: I don't know what it means
to say.


1618
2:27:27,669 --> 2:27:32,199
"We are not repeatable scientifically".
Everybody in this room has a large number


1619
2:27:32,199 --> 2:27:37,829
of properties in common but they're all shared
and that have scientific explanations.


1620
2:27:37,829 --> 2:27:42,589
Everybody in this room differs from everyone
else in a variety of different respects and


1621
2:27:42,589 --> 2:27:49,439
those differences are also open to increasingly
the subject of scientific explanations with


1622
2:27:49,439 --> 2:27:57,1
substantial, additional, predictive content
that certify their improvement over previous


1623
2:27:57,1 --> 2:28:0,47
scientific explanations.


1624
2:28:0,47 --> 2:28:9,6
As for personal experience in history, as
we all know and this happens to be my principal


1625
2:28:9,6 --> 2:28:13,529
career interest as a philosopher, the philosophy
of social sciences.


1626
2:28:13,529 --> 2:28:20,699
As we all know, there are grave difficulties
involved in applying the methods of the natural


1627
2:28:20,699 --> 2:28:24,909
sciences, of the empirical sciences to human
questions.


1628
2:28:24,909 --> 2:28:33,1
In many respects, these are submitting of
imaginative, interesting and powerful solutions


1629
2:28:33,1 --> 2:28:34,399
as we speak.


1630
2:28:34,399 --> 2:28:41,109
If I'm right, and no one will know if I'm
right about this well after all of us in this


1631
2:28:41,109 --> 2:28:47,18
room are dead.
If I'm right, eventually the sciences broadly


1632
2:28:47,18 --> 2:28:51,6
understood.
Will provide as predictably powerful and therefore


1633
2:28:51,6 --> 2:28:57,119
as explanatorily credible accounts of the
nature and character and trajectory of individual


1634
2:28:57,119 --> 2:29:3,97
human lives as they now provide for the planets,
but of course I could be wrong.


1635
2:29:3,97 --> 2:29:5,419
It's an empirical question.


1636
2:29:5,419 --> 2:29:7,6
Speaker 6: Thank you.


1637
2:29:7,6 --> 2:29:13,93
Dr. Craig: This is the question of epistemological
naturalism that I raised in my second speech.


1638
2:29:13,93 --> 2:29:17,659
Remember I said, "The one reason that's regard
of this a false theory of knowledge is because


1639
2:29:17,659 --> 2:29:23,79
it's overly restrictive".
In particular, Dr. Rosenberg is very harsh


1640
2:29:23,79 --> 2:29:29,109
in his book on the humanities in terms of
the humanities not really being a source of


1641
2:29:29,109 --> 2:29:31,879
knowledge at all, including history.


1642
2:29:31,879 --> 2:29:37,409
And this has led many of the reviewers of
Dr. Rosenberg's book to be very critical with


1643
2:29:37,409 --> 2:29:47,18
regard to this narrow scientism that he propounds.
For example, Michael Ruse who is an agnostic


1644
2:29:47,18 --> 2:29:53,27
philosopher of science says this, "I think
Rosenberg's insensitivity to history blinds


1645
2:29:53,27 --> 2:29:58,93
him to the fact that science does not ask
certain questions and so it is no surprise


1646
2:29:58,93 --> 2:30:0,68
that it does not give answers."


1647
2:30:0,68 --> 2:30:6,399
"I'm not at all sure that the theists' answers
are correct, but they are not shown to be


1648
2:30:6,399 --> 2:30:12,109
incorrect by modern science.
Science is limited in scope and by its very


1649
2:30:12,109 --> 2:30:18,89
nature is destined forever to be limited."
So, science may be the best way of getting


1650
2:30:18,89 --> 2:30:24,56
at knowledge of the physical world the way
it operates, but there are many other fields


1651
2:30:24,56 --> 2:30:31,51
of knowledge that also are sources of truth
and knowledge about the world including mathematics,


1652
2:30:31,51 --> 2:30:37,109
metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, history and
so forth.


1653
2:30:37,109 --> 2:30:44,379
Dr. Rosenberg: All I can say is we weren't
debating this book; which is not widely available.


1654
2:30:44,379 --> 2:30:49,209
(Laughs).
We were debating the reasonableness of the


1655
2:30:49,209 --> 2:30:50,699
belief in God's existence.


1656
2:30:50,699 --> 2:30:58,93
Dr. Craig: Could I ask you a question, Dr.
Rosenberg? Given the debate question tonight,


1657
2:30:58,93 --> 2:31:6,979
is faith in God reasonable? I thought and
anticipated that you would say much more about


1658
2:31:6,979 --> 2:31:13,29
your defensive scientism because it seems
to me that that's the principle reason that


1659
2:31:13,29 --> 2:31:18,789
you are skeptical about the existence of God.


1660
2:31:18,789 --> 2:31:24,619
And so, I'm curious why didn't you make this
more of an issue in tonight's debate? That


1661
2:31:24,619 --> 2:31:30,869
would show God and faith in God to be unreasonable
if scientism or epistemological naturalism


1662
2:31:30,869 --> 2:31:35,359
were true or metaphysical naturalism, I'm
sorry, I meant to say.


1663
2:31:35,359 --> 2:31:40,749
Dr. Rosenberg: I wrote this book because I
was relatively disenchanted with the tide


1664
2:31:40,749 --> 2:31:48,499
of works by Hitchens, and Dawkins, and Harris.
Here I exclude Dan Dennett, who's book the


1665
2:31:48,499 --> 2:31:51,76
Breaking the Spell is quite in order ...
a different order of magnitude.


1666
2:31:51,76 --> 2:31:58,81
I was rather tired of books hammering another
nail into the coffin of theism.


1667
2:31:58,81 --> 2:32:7,189
I'm much more eager to put before a public
that might be interested in the real implications


1668
2:32:7,189 --> 2:32:12,119
of science for the perennial questions of
philosophy for what a radio humorist named


1669
2:32:12,119 --> 2:32:16,43
Garrison Keillor calls the persistent questions
that bother that guy in the 14th floor of


1670
2:32:16,43 --> 2:32:21,79
the Acme Building in St.
Paul, Minnesota, the guy that was excluded


1671
2:32:21,79 --> 2:32:26,3
from referring to by my editor because he
said nobody ever heard of Garrison Keillor.


1672
2:32:26,3 --> 2:32:30,379
(Audience laughing).


1673
2:32:30,379 --> 2:32:35,93
I was interested in exploring what the consequences
of science were for these fundamental questions


1674
2:32:35,93 --> 2:32:41,249
of philosophy that keep us up at night.
Right? What I said at the beginning of this


1675
2:32:41,249 --> 2:32:47,539
book is science gives us the best argument
for atheism and it's so good that I don't


1676
2:32:47,539 --> 2:32:52,72
have to rehearse it in this book.
I want to go on and talk about all the other


1677
2:32:52,72 --> 2:32:59,579
things that those of us who are atheists because
we believe that science describes the nature


1678
2:32:59,579 --> 2:33:1,55
of reality, ought to believe.


1679
2:33:1,55 --> 2:33:9,149
Now, I don't think that in a discussion about
atheism, the further consequences of science


1680
2:33:9,149 --> 2:33:15,999
which I claim to obtain are relevant or material.
And I certainly know, and I'm sure you will


1681
2:33:15,999 --> 2:33:22,959
agree with me, that those who reject these
conclusions can do so by saying they don't


1682
2:33:22,959 --> 2:33:30,339
follow from science.
Of course I take it that on your own view


1683
2:33:30,339 --> 2:33:35,81
either these conclusions do follow from science
and therefore my book is vindicated as an


1684
2:33:35,81 --> 2:33:41,77
account of how science deals with the perennial
questions that keep us all up at night, or


1685
2:33:41,77 --> 2:33:47,51
else you've committed a flagrant logical fallacy
of affirming the consequent.


1686
2:33:47,51 --> 2:33:52,909
Dr. Craig: No, what I said was it doesn't
follow from epistemological naturalism, but


1687
2:33:52,909 --> 2:33:59,29
I do agree with you that your conclusions
follow from metaphysical naturalism and that


1688
2:33:59,29 --> 2:33:59,29
...


1689
2:33:59,29 --> 2:34:1,89
Dr. Rosenberg: No, my argument is not they
follow from metaphysical naturalism.


1690
2:34:1,89 --> 2:34:6,529
My argument is they follow from the substantive
claims of the sciences, physics, chemistry,


1691
2:34:6,529 --> 2:34:7,129
biology, neuroscience ...


1692
2:34:7,129 --> 2:34:8,619
Dr. Craig: Yes, I disagree ...


1693
2:34:8,619 --> 2:34:14,14
Dr. Rosenberg: It's not philosophy that I
am deducing these consequences from.


1694
2:34:14,14 --> 2:34:16,229
It's science and of course we can argue about
that.


1695
2:34:16,229 --> 2:34:21,479
Dr. Craig: Yes, I disagree with that part,
but where I agreed with you in contrast to


1696
2:34:21,479 --> 2:34:28,1
the Dawkins and the Hitchens and Dennett and
others, where I agreed with you was that if


1697
2:34:28,1 --> 2:34:34,869
only physical things exist, if physics fixes
all the facts as you put it, then it seems


1698
2:34:34,869 --> 2:34:40,77
to me you're right, there isn't any intentional
states and there aren't any meaning to sentences,


1699
2:34:40,77 --> 2:34:41,359
there is no truth.


1700
2:34:41,359 --> 2:34:45,2
Dr. Rosenberg: Yes, could I get you to write
a blurb for the back of my book?


1701
2:34:45,2 --> 2:34:48,939
Dr. Craig: Somebody ...
somebody on Facebook said, why have a debate


1702
2:34:48,939 --> 2:34:56,119
between Craig and Rosenberg, they both agree
on the consequences of denying God and so


1703
2:34:56,119 --> 2:34:59,819
he thought it would be pointless, but I mean
it drives you back to the question, well is


1704
2:34:59,819 --> 2:35:1,56
there a God? It's metaphysical naturalism.


1705
2:35:1,56 --> 2:35:5,149
Dr. Rosenberg: Maybe there's a chance for
my book to be in the Christian bookstores


1706
2:35:5,149 --> 2:35:6,749
after all?


1707
2:35:6,749 --> 2:35:10,439
Dr. Craig: Yes.
(Laughing).


1708
2:35:10,439 --> 2:35:12,289
(Audience clapping).


1709
2:35:12,289 --> 2:35:18,579
Dr. Miller: On that note, let's (laughing)
two more questions here.


1710
2:35:18,579 --> 2:35:23,949
I'm going to go right back to you Dr. Rosenberg
and then will take one from this side because


1711
2:35:23,949 --> 2:35:24,569
this is an interesting ...


1712
2:35:24,569 --> 2:35:27,289
Dr. Rosenberg: You know Corey I've been asking
you to call me Alex all day (laughs).


1713
2:35:27,289 --> 2:35:31,56
Dr. Miller: But you also wanted me to call
you Dr. Rosenberg and that Rosenberg like


1714
2:35:31,56 --> 2:35:34,619
in a football game.
(Laughing).


1715
2:35:34,619 --> 2:35:42,669
Okay, Alex (Laughing).
Gabriel Sotto from Costa Rica: Let's assume


1716
2:35:42,669 --> 2:35:47,8
that God does not exist and you were right,
then what is your explanation for the existence


1717
2:35:47,8 --> 2:35:50,29
of evil if there is no evil and good?


1718
2:35:50,29 --> 2:36:1,149
Dr. Rosenberg: Of course my explanation ...
the explanation that I offer in this book


1719
2:36:1,149 --> 2:36:6,8
not to put too fine a point on it, isn't an
explanation of evil because that would commit


1720
2:36:6,8 --> 2:36:15,529
me to a normative theory which I am unprepared
to endorse, but I have an explanation for


1721
2:36:15,529 --> 2:36:24,6
suffering, for the pain and misery of human
existence and of other biological systems.


1722
2:36:24,6 --> 2:36:32,949
And regrettably, it has to do with the nature
of matter and the nature of the struggle for


1723
2:36:32,949 --> 2:36:39,72
survival and the competition among physical
systems including biological systems and animals


1724
2:36:39,72 --> 2:36:49,27
and us for survival; and the fact that nature
has so organized living matter as to provide


1725
2:36:49,27 --> 2:36:54,68
it with signals when it's doing something
that's dangerous for its persistence and its


1726
2:36:54,68 --> 2:36:59,409
well-being by giving it pain.
Right?


1727
2:36:59,409 --> 2:37:3,539
Now, I don't think it's a great mystery why
physical systems...


1728
2:37:3,539 --> 2:37:8,55
why biological system should feel ...
have sensations in particular sensations of


1729
2:37:8,55 --> 2:37:13,119
pain and discomfort.
Those are signals that nature is providing


1730
2:37:13,119 --> 2:37:20,6
or they are the byproducts of signals that
nature is providing about the threats to one's


1731
2:37:20,6 --> 2:37:24,97
well-being.
That's about the best I think we can do by


1732
2:37:24,97 --> 2:37:31,839
way of explaining, "Why there is suffering?"
Okay? Giving a scientific and empirical, a


1733
2:37:31,839 --> 2:37:36,949
factual explanation for why there is suffering
as opposed to theological explanation for


1734
2:37:36,949 --> 2:37:37,279
why there is suffering.


1735
2:37:37,279 --> 2:37:37,399
Dr. Miller: Dr. Craig do you care to respond
to that or just ...


1736
2:37:37,399 --> 2:37:38,93
Dr. Craig: No comment.


1737
2:37:38,93 --> 2:37:45,64
Dr. Miller: Let's take one last question on
this side to Dr. Craig.


1738
2:37:45,64 --> 2:37:52,409
Speaker 7: Yes my question is for Dr. Craig.
The Bible says that Jesus loves us, wants


1739
2:37:52,409 --> 2:37:55,31
a relationship with us and wants us to believe
in Him.


1740
2:37:55,31 --> 2:38:1,279
He even showed himself to disbelievers like
you mentioned to people such as Thomas after


1741
2:38:1,279 --> 2:38:5,56
he was crucified to help them believe.
My question is why does Jesus not continue


1742
2:38:5,56 --> 2:38:11,55
to physically reveal himself to people particularly
unbelievers to show them that He is real?


1743
2:38:11,55 --> 2:38:15,81
Dr. Craig: Yes.
Obviously God could make his existence or


1744
2:38:15,81 --> 2:38:23,29
Christ's existence more evident than he has.
He could have the stars spell out "God exists"


1745
2:38:23,29 --> 2:38:29,52
in the sky or he could have every atom inscribed
with the label "made by God".


1746
2:38:29,52 --> 2:38:36,319
Clearly, God could make his existence a lot
more obvious, but I think what the point you


1747
2:38:36,319 --> 2:38:41,35
were making is the salient one.
God isn't interested in just getting people


1748
2:38:41,35 --> 2:38:47,77
to believe that he exists to add one more
piece of furniture to their ontology of the


1749
2:38:47,77 --> 2:38:48,569
universe.


1750
2:38:48,569 --> 2:38:53,669
He wants to bring people into a loving, saving
relationship with himself.


1751
2:38:53,669 --> 2:39:1,229
I think that God in his providence knows how
to so order the world so as to bring the maximal


1752
2:39:1,229 --> 2:39:6,35
or optimal number of people freely into relationship
with himself.


1753
2:39:6,35 --> 2:39:14,399
He knows that it isn't necessary or profitable
to have Jesus of Nazareth appear miraculously


1754
2:39:14,399 --> 2:39:19,77
to every single person in his lifetime in
order to provide sufficient grace for salvation


1755
2:39:19,77 --> 2:39:20,409
to everybody.


1756
2:39:20,409 --> 2:39:26,499
In fact, it's possible that in a world in
which God's existence was as plain as the


1757
2:39:26,499 --> 2:39:32,169
nose on your face in which Jesus was constantly
appearing in people's bedrooms, that they


1758
2:39:32,169 --> 2:39:38,369
would get rather annoyed at the effrontery
of this intruder, popping into their houses


1759
2:39:38,369 --> 2:39:43,589
all the time uninvited, and wouldn't lead
at all to a deeper faith or love in Him.


1760
2:39:43,589 --> 2:39:49,18
So, I think that we can trust God's wisdom
in providentially ordering the world in such


1761
2:39:49,18 --> 2:39:56,279
a way that people are given adequate but not
coercive evidence for his existence and the


1762
2:39:56,279 --> 2:39:59,629
question then for us is how will we respond
to that.


1763
2:39:59,629 --> 2:40:3,869
It's not an adequate response to complain
that you want more evidence.


1764
2:40:3,869 --> 2:40:10,97
You need to look at the evidence that you
do have and to make a decision on that basis,


1765
2:40:10,97 --> 2:40:17,629
but I don't think that...
there's any reason here to think that God


1766
2:40:17,629 --> 2:40:25,399
would do what you suggest, it may be that
that would do nothing in terms of bringing


1767
2:40:25,399 --> 2:40:30,279
a greater number of people into a saving relationship
with Himself.


1768
2:40:30,279 --> 2:40:32,709
(Audience clapping).


1769
2:40:32,709 --> 2:40:39,569
Dr. Miller: Give one last question for Dr.
Rosenberg and then we will give you the results


1770
2:40:39,569 --> 2:40:42,399
of the vote and close out.


1771
2:40:42,399 --> 2:40:48,589
Speaker 8: Dr. Rosenberg, I wonder if you
might help me to understand how your view


1772
2:40:48,589 --> 2:40:54,149
is not incoherent.
Do you really claim in your book that sentences


1773
2:40:54,149 --> 2:41:1,93
have no meaning or truth value; even the sentences
in your own book? How is that not incoherent


1774
2:41:1,93 --> 2:41:11,14
and self-refuting? At least the sentences
you've made tonight surely you think are true,


1775
2:41:11,14 --> 2:41:19,589
but if even you don't think that your position
is true, why should we?


1776
2:41:19,589 --> 2:41:31,989
Dr. Rosenberg: Two paragraphs from the last
page of the chapter of my book entitled The


1777
2:41:31,989 --> 2:41:34,839
Brain Does Everything without Thinking about
Anything at All.


1778
2:41:34,839 --> 2:41:42,819
Of course this is at the end of a long chapter
in which I've talked about neuroscience, Nobel


1779
2:41:42,819 --> 2:41:50,709
Prize Winning Research by Erick Kandel, the
wonderful IBM computer Watson that beats us


1780
2:41:50,709 --> 2:42:0,399
at Jeopardy and about the best semantic and
Philosophical Theories of Intentionality.


1781
2:42:0,399 --> 2:42:4,51
Pardon me for reading.
"Introspection is screaming that thought has


1782
2:42:4,51 --> 2:42:10,279
to be about stuff and philosophers and you
are muttering, denying it is crazy worse than


1783
2:42:10,279 --> 2:42:14,979
self-contradictory, it's incoherent.
According to you Rosenberg neither spoken


1784
2:42:14,979 --> 2:42:19,439
sentences nor silent ones in thought express
statements, they aren't about anything that


1785
2:42:19,439 --> 2:42:23,39
goes for every sentence in this book, it's
not about anything.


1786
2:42:23,39 --> 2:42:27,539
Why are we bothering to read it?" It's not
as if I haven't figured it out that this is


1787
2:42:27,539 --> 2:42:33,14
an issue that is raised by science and in
this chapter.


1788
2:42:33,14 --> 2:42:39,569
Now, I'll read you the last paragraph, "Look,
if I am going to get scientism into your skull


1789
2:42:39,569 --> 2:42:45,239
I have to use the only tools we've got for
moving information from one head to another:


1790
2:42:45,239 --> 2:42:50,1
noises, ink-marks, pixels.
Treat the illusions that go with them like


1791
2:42:50,1 --> 2:42:55,869
the optical illusions of the previous chaptr."
A chapter in which I said don't trust consciousness,


1792
2:42:55,869 --> 2:43:1,159
because it's mainly mistaken.
"This book isn't conveying statements.


1793
2:43:1,159 --> 2:43:6,729
It's rearranging neural circuits, removing
inaccurate disinformation and replacing it


1794
2:43:6,729 --> 2:43:11,18
with accurate information.
Treat it as correcting maps instead of erasing


1795
2:43:11,18 --> 2:43:18,939
sentences." Now, there is a big business in
philosophy about the nature of semantics and


1796
2:43:18,939 --> 2:43:21,56
about the how intentionality's realized.


1797
2:43:21,56 --> 2:43:27,749
I ain't so stupid as to contradict myself
in the puerile way that you're suggesting,


1798
2:43:27,749 --> 2:43:32,64
okay? What you got to do is read the book
to figure out the answer and send me an email


1799
2:43:32,64 --> 2:43:37,35
and I'll send you a really long and hard paper
called the Eliminativism Without Tears, which


1800
2:43:37,35 --> 2:43:44,369
I have written to try to give a detailed account
of why it is that we can still make sense


1801
2:43:44,369 --> 2:43:52,839
to one another in spite of the fact that neuroscience
shows that intentionality is just an overlay


1802
2:43:52,839 --> 2:43:58,779
like so much of the rest of our common sense
views about reality; including the belief


1803
2:43:58,779 --> 2:44:5,69
that Europe is still standing because things
just fall directly to the ground.


1804
2:44:5,69 --> 2:44:8,279
(Audience clapping)


1805
2:44:8,279 --> 2:44:15,779
Dr. Miller: Very good.
Well, let me go ahead and read these tallies


1806
2:44:15,779 --> 2:44:21,479
and close us out.
It's not a scientific result here, but we've


1807
2:44:21,479 --> 2:44:26,51
got three interesting results nonetheless
from across section of audiences, our formal


1808
2:44:26,51 --> 2:44:33,549
judge team, our Purdue audience, and across
the web nationally and internationally.


1809
2:44:33,549 --> 2:44:40,47
So, for the formal judging, in a four to two
decision our judging panel has identified


1810
2:44:40,47 --> 2:44:47,6
Dr. Craig is the winner of this evening's
debate.


1811
2:44:47,6 --> 2:45:1,329
(Audience clapping).
For the local result from Purdue, we have


1812
2:45:1,329 --> 2:45:9,279
no vote at all 112 and on by far most people
did not vote, half didn't vote, it appears


1813
2:45:9,279 --> 2:45:14,97
they didn't even write cards.
Sheesh! Dr. Rosenberg has 303 and Dr. Craig


1814
2:45:14,97 --> 2:45:25,22
1,390.
(Audience clapping).


1815
2:45:25,22 --> 2:45:33,709
Online vote, it appears that Dr. Craig has
734 and Dr. Rosenberg 59.


1816
2:45:33,709 --> 2:45:35,199
(Audience clapping).


1817
2:45:35,199 --> 2:45:41,779
So, for whatever its worth, so let's go ahead
and close this out.


1818
2:45:41,779 --> 2:45:47,939
These gentlemen are very enlightening people,
fun to hang out with, and they're going to


1819
2:45:47,939 --> 2:45:53,579
stick around for another half an hour to answer
questions that people perhaps come up and


1820
2:45:53,579 --> 2:45:55,85
talk with them.


1821
2:45:55,85 --> 2:45:58,109
As someone who loves ...
this may sound morbid ...


1822
2:45:58,109 --> 2:46:4,329
but loves to visit cemeteries; I do it every
time I go to a new town for historical imagination,


1823
2:46:4,329 --> 2:46:9,369
I've mentioned this many times before and
I'm still eager to find this, if someone knows


1824
2:46:9,369 --> 2:46:15,1
of this cemetery with a tomb stone with a
particular epitaph on it, I will pay money.


1825
2:46:15,1 --> 2:46:21,6
It reads this way, "Pause, stranger, when
you pass me by: As you are now, so once was


1826
2:46:21,6 --> 2:46:25,199
I.
As I am now, so you will be, so prepare for


1827
2:46:25,199 --> 2:46:28,659
death and follow me."


1828
2:46:28,659 --> 2:46:34,1
And somebody came by philosophic, probably
a skeptic or something like that and wrote,


1829
2:46:34,1 --> 2:46:41,979
"To follow you, I'm not content until I know
which way you went." (Laughing).


1830
2:46:41,979 --> 2:46:47,329
(Audience clapping)


1831
2:46:47,329 --> 2:46:50,77
We do thank you for coming and watching the
live stream tonight.


1832
2:46:50,77 --> 2:46:56,81
We hope it was beneficial, generating more
light than heat, look next to the book, and


1833
2:46:56,81 --> 2:47:0,989
to YouTube no doubt it provides something
to reflect upon and think about which of the


1834
2:47:0,989 --> 2:47:7,97
three dozen talks you'll attend tomorrow;
see www.symposiachristi.com for details.


1835
2:47:7,97 --> 2:47:16,81
Drop your pencils on the way out and someone
will give you a detailed list of tomorrow's


1836
2:47:16,81 --> 2:47:18,79
events.
Good night.


1837
2:47:18,79 --> 2:49:18,79
Thank you.
