0:0:6,136 --> 0:0:16,471
[SPEAKING KOREAN]


3
0:0:16,471 --> 0:0:18,55
SHANE SMITH: So we go
see [INAUDIBLE].


4
0:0:18,55 --> 0:0:21,452
Thank you, North Korea,
you blew our minds.


5
0:0:21,452 --> 0:0:24,41
But time is ticking, we got into
North Korea and all I'm


6
0:0:24,41 --> 0:0:27,37
going to have is footage of
monuments and libraries.


7
0:0:27,37 --> 0:0:28,276
We're bummed.


8
0:0:28,276 --> 0:0:31,17
I have the shits.


9
0:0:31,17 --> 0:0:35,13
I don't know what the fuck
I'm eating half the time.


10
0:0:35,13 --> 0:0:36,12
We're very tired.


11
0:0:36,12 --> 0:0:38,595
We're going to go out getting
drunk with our guides tonight.


12
0:0:38,595 --> 0:0:40,8
Hopefully they'll let
us shoot more.


13
0:0:40,8 --> 0:0:43,57



14
0:0:43,57 --> 0:0:45,9
I look like a used
car salesman from


15
0:0:45,9 --> 0:0:47,15
Boca Raton or something.


16
0:0:47,15 --> 0:0:50,14



17
0:0:50,14 --> 0:0:52,1
What does anyone do at
Pyongyang at night?


18
0:0:52,1 --> 0:0:53,39
There's nothing.


19
0:0:53,39 --> 0:0:54,54
There's zero to do.


20
0:0:54,54 --> 0:0:57,17
But in our hotel there's
a karaoke place.


21
0:0:57,17 --> 0:0:59,83
And the only people who go to
karaoke are foreigners,


22
0:0:59,83 --> 0:1:2,11
generals, and high-ranking
party officials.


23
0:1:2,11 --> 0:1:3,98
MALE SPEAKER: Check,
check, check.


24
0:1:3,98 --> 0:1:3,592
1, 2.


25
0:1:3,592 --> 0:1:4,58
[INAUDIBLE]


26
0:1:4,58 --> 0:1:5,83
1, 2, 1, 2.


27
0:1:5,83 --> 0:1:13,175



28
0:1:13,175 --> 0:1:14,77
SHANE SMITH: So we get drunk.


29
0:1:14,77 --> 0:1:17,22
We meet these generals, we're
partying with them, and we're


30
0:1:17,22 --> 0:1:20,9
like how do you get anything
done here?


31
0:1:20,9 --> 0:1:22,58
How do we go see these
film studios?


32
0:1:22,58 --> 0:1:23,74
And they were very cautious.


33
0:1:23,74 --> 0:1:25,59
They said look, I'm not going to
stick my neck out and tell


34
0:1:25,59 --> 0:1:26,59
you anything.


35
0:1:26,59 --> 0:1:28,26
But here's a word of advice--


36
0:1:28,26 --> 0:1:31,78
dress like us, pay your respects
to Kim Il-sung at the


37
0:1:31,78 --> 0:1:33,478
statue, and see what happens.


38
0:1:33,478 --> 0:1:39,78



39
0:1:39,78 --> 0:1:42,2
So we're like, OK, let's
go get some clothes.


40
0:1:42,2 --> 0:1:43,54
Problem is, you can't.


41
0:1:43,54 --> 0:1:47,2
You can't go to a store, you
can't even handle the money.


42
0:1:47,2 --> 0:1:49,17
So we had to find a tailor
and say hey, can


43
0:1:49,17 --> 0:1:50,11
you make us a suit?


44
0:1:50,11 --> 0:1:53,65
And by the way, we need
it in five hours.


45
0:1:53,65 --> 0:1:57,65
What we want to do is we want
to get North Korean-like


46
0:1:57,65 --> 0:2:0,49
clothes and a badge,
and go and pay


47
0:2:0,49 --> 0:2:2,79
respects to Kim Il-sung.


48
0:2:2,79 --> 0:2:5,5
MR. KIM: You say that
[INAUDIBLE]


49
0:2:5,5 --> 0:2:6,5
Kim Il-sung.


50
0:2:6,5 --> 0:2:7,5
You don't say--


51
0:2:7,5 --> 0:2:9,699
SHANE SMITH: Kim Jong-Il.


52
0:2:9,699 --> 0:2:12,68
MR. KIM: The Chairman
Kim Jong-Il, or


53
0:2:12,68 --> 0:2:14,2
Great Leader Kim Jong-Il.


54
0:2:14,2 --> 0:2:16,6
We only say it like that.


55
0:2:16,6 --> 0:2:21,15
So please say it like that,
Great Leader Kim Jong-Il,


56
0:2:21,15 --> 0:2:23,87
General Kim Jong-Il, and
Chairman Kim Jong-Il.


57
0:2:23,87 --> 0:2:25,73
SHANE SMITH: And what
about Kim Il-sung?


58
0:2:25,73 --> 0:2:26,9
Great leader?


59
0:2:26,9 --> 0:2:26,66
MR. KIM: President
Kim Il-sung.


60
0:2:26,66 --> 0:2:27,89
SHANE SMITH: President
Kim Il-sung.


61
0:2:27,89 --> 0:2:28,77
OK.


62
0:2:28,77 --> 0:2:33,2
Can we go to where he lies in
state, the Kim Il-sung Palace?


63
0:2:33,2 --> 0:2:34,706
Great Leader Kim
Il-sung Palace?


64
0:2:34,706 --> 0:2:39,11
MR. KIM: Great Leader Kim
Jong-Il, General Kim Jong-Il,


65
0:2:39,11 --> 0:2:39,99
Chairman Kim Jong-Il.


66
0:2:39,99 --> 0:2:41,215
SHANE SMITH: President
Kim Il-sung.


67
0:2:41,215 --> 0:2:42,24
MR. KIM: Yeah.


68
0:2:42,24 --> 0:2:43,12
SHANE SMITH: OK.


69
0:2:43,12 --> 0:2:46,35
Now, does Kim Jong-Il
have a son?


70
0:2:46,35 --> 0:2:47,115
MALE SPEAKER: Chairman.


71
0:2:47,115 --> 0:2:47,94
MR. KIM: General Kim Jong-Il.


72
0:2:47,94 --> 0:2:49,74
SHANE SMITH: Oh, General
Kim Jong-Il.


73
0:2:49,74 --> 0:2:50,66
Does he have a son?


74
0:2:50,66 --> 0:2:51,52
MR. KIM: I don't know.


75
0:2:51,52 --> 0:2:53,85
We only respect our General
Kim Jong-Il.


76
0:2:53,85 --> 0:2:54,53
SHANE SMITH: I'm going
to respect them both.


77
0:2:54,53 --> 0:2:56,225
I'm going to leave flowers.


78
0:2:56,225 --> 0:2:58,35
MR. KIM: That's a good
idea, that's perfect.


79
0:2:58,35 --> 0:2:59,46
We are friends now.


80
0:2:59,46 --> 0:2:59,98
SHANE SMITH: We're friends.


81
0:2:59,98 --> 0:3:1,23
MR. KIM: If you respect to--


82
0:3:1,23 --> 0:3:1,97
SHANE SMITH: We'll
be best friends.


83
0:3:1,97 --> 0:3:3,34
MR. KIM: With your hearts.


84
0:3:3,34 --> 0:3:5,25
Respect our General Kim Jong-Il
and President Kim


85
0:3:5,25 --> 0:3:8,2
Il-sung with your hearts,
we'll be best friends.


86
0:3:8,2 --> 0:3:8,833
SHANE SMITH: Good.


87
0:3:8,833 --> 0:3:9,62
MR. KIM: [INAUDIBLE]


88
0:3:9,62 --> 0:3:10,61
SHANE SMITH: I'm excited.


89
0:3:10,61 --> 0:3:11,86
I can't wait.


90
0:3:11,86 --> 0:3:18,6



91
0:3:18,6 --> 0:3:21,19
I want like this, but lighter.


92
0:3:21,19 --> 0:3:23,49
Yeah, yeah, perfect.


93
0:3:23,49 --> 0:3:25,54
We're going to look like
that when we're done.


94
0:3:25,54 --> 0:3:35,67



95
0:3:35,67 --> 0:3:37,82
We're about to go pay our
respects to the Great Leader


96
0:3:37,82 --> 0:3:40,21
Kim Il-sung, Eternal
President.


97
0:3:40,21 --> 0:3:41,46
Let's go [? do it. ?]


98
0:3:41,46 --> 0:3:49,88



99
0:3:49,88 --> 0:3:52,38
After that, everything
changed.


100
0:3:52,38 --> 0:3:53,85
Smiles all around.


101
0:3:53,85 --> 0:3:54,97
What do you want to do?


102
0:3:54,97 --> 0:3:56,6
Where you want to go?


103
0:3:56,6 --> 0:3:58,15
And finally, they let
us go see the


104
0:3:58,15 --> 0:4:0,5
North Korean film studios.


105
0:4:0,5 --> 0:4:7,1



106
0:4:7,1 --> 0:4:45,29



107
0:4:45,29 --> 0:4:46,54
SHANE SMITH: Thank you.


108
0:4:46,54 --> 0:4:53,13



109
0:4:53,13 --> 0:4:56,511
So we're at the film studios in
Pyongyang in North Korea.


110
0:4:56,511 --> 0:4:58,459
This is the Great Leader
Kim Il-sung


111
0:4:58,459 --> 0:5:0,9
behind us with the cameras.


112
0:5:0,9 --> 0:5:2,7
Let's go and check
out how they make


113
0:5:2,7 --> 0:5:6,38
films in North Korea.


114
0:5:6,38 --> 0:5:7,79
MR. PAK:

117
0:5:25,14 --> 0:5:29,21



118
0:5:29,21 --> 0:5:31,21
SHANE SMITH: General Kim Jong-Il
made a film of the


119
0:5:31,21 --> 0:5:33,1
Great Leader Kim Il-sung?


120
0:5:33,1 --> 0:5:33,74
He made a film?

0:5:37,55 --> 0:5:38,49
SHANE SMITH: OK.


124
0:5:38,49 --> 0:5:39,74
Shall we go inside?


125
0:5:39,74 --> 0:5:56,59



126
0:5:56,59 --> 0:5:58,62
So we're in the film
studio now.


127
0:5:58,62 --> 0:6:2,462
We're being introduced by a
very amazing picture of


128
0:6:2,462 --> 0:6:4,922
General Kim Jong-Il.


129
0:6:4,922 --> 0:6:8,87
He's directing a mega-picture
of the war.


130
0:6:8,87 --> 0:6:9,19
[WHISPERING]


131
0:6:9,19 --> 0:6:10,9
It's totally insane.


132
0:6:10,9 --> 0:6:13,0
I shouldn't say it's
totally insane.


133
0:6:13,0 --> 0:6:14,25
It's totally insane.


134
0:6:14,25 --> 0:8:14,25
