###3 MARTHA RADDATZ: Good evening, and welcome to the first and only vice presidential debate
###7 of 2012, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. I’m Martha Raddatz of ABC News,
###14 and I am honored to moderate this debate between two men who have dedicated much of their lives
###19 to public service.
###21 Tonight’s debate is divided between domestic and foreign policy issues.
###26 And I’m going to move back and forth between foreign and domestic since that is what a
###29 vice president or president would have to do.
###32 We will have nine different segments. At the beginning of each segment, I will ask both
###37 candidates a question, and they will each have two minutes to answer. Then I will encourage
###42 a discussion between the candidates with follow-up questions. By coin toss, it has been determined
###48 that Vice President Biden will be first to answer the opening question.
###53 We have a wonderful audience here at Centre College tonight. You will no doubt hear their
###57 enthusiasm at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Vice President Biden and
###64 Congressman Paul Ryan. (Applause.)
###67 Very nice to see you. Very nice to see you.
###78 VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH BIDEN: How you doing?
###86 MS. RADDATZ: Hey, you got your little wave to the families in. That’s great.
###94 Good evening, gentlemen. It really is an honor to be here with both of you.
###98 I would like to begin with Libya on a rather somber note. One month ago tonight, on the
###104 anniversary of 9/11, Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other brave Americans were killed
###110 in a terrorist attack in Benghazi. The State Department has now made clear there were no
###116 protesters there. It was a pre-planned assault by heavily armed men. Wasn’t this a massive
###123 intelligence failure, Vice President Biden?
###125 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: What it was, it was a tragedy, Martha. It -- Chris Stevens was
###130 one of our best. We lost three other brave Americans.
###132 And I can make absolutely two commitments to you and all of the American people tonight:
###138 One, we will find and bring to justice the men who did this.
###143 And secondly, we will get to the bottom of it, and whatever -- wherever the facts lead
###147 us, wherever they lead us, w will make clear to the American public, because whatever mistakes
###152 were made will not be made again.
###154 When you’re looking at a president, Martha, it seems to me that you should take a look
###158 at his most important responsibility. That’s carrying forward the national security of
###164 the country. And the best way to do that is take a look at how he’s handled he issues
###167 of the day.
###168 On Iraq, the president said he would end the war. Governor Romney said that was a tragic
###173 mistake; we should have left -- that he ended it -- Governor Romney said that was a tragic
###178 mistake; we should have left 30,000 troops there.
###180 With regard to Afghanistan, he said he will end the war in 2014. Governor Romney said
###185 we should not set a date, number one, and number two, with regard to 2014, it depends.
###191 When it came to Osama bin Laden, the president, the first day in office -- I was sitting with
###197 him in the Oval Office. He called in the CIA and signed an order saying, my highest priority
###201 is to get bin Laden.
###203 Prior to the election, prior to the -- him being sworn in, Governor Romney was asked
###208 a question about how he would proceed. He said, I wouldn’t move heaven and earth to
###211 get bin Laden. He didn’t understand it was more than about taking a -- a murderer off
###216 the battlefield; it was about restoring America’s heart and letting terrorists around the world
###221 know if you do harm to America, we will track you to the gates of hell, if need be.
###227 And lastly, the -- the president of the United States has -- has led with a steady hand and
###232 clear vision. Governor Romney, the opposite. The last thing we need now is another war.
###239 MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.
###242 REP. RYAN: (Sighs.) We mourn the loss of these four Americans who were murdered. When you
###247 take a look at what has happened just in the last few weeks, they sent the U.N. ambassador
###252 out to say that this was because of a protest and a YouTube video. It took the president
###258 two weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack. He went to the U.N., and in his speech
###264 at the U.N. he said six times -- he talked about the YouTube video.
###268 Look, if we are hit by terrorists, we’re going to call it for what it is, a terrorist
###272 attack. Our ambassador in Paris has a Marine detachment guarding him. Shouldn’t we have
###279 a Marine detachment guarding our ambassador in Benghazi, a place where we knew that there
###284 was an al-Qaida cell with arms? This is becoming more troubling by the day. They first blamed
###292 the YouTube video; now they’re trying to blame the Romney-Ryan ticket for making this
###296 an issue.
###297 And with respect to Iraq, we had the same position before the withdrawal, which was
###304 we agreed with the Obama administration: Let’s have a Status of Forces Agreement to make
###308 sure that we secure our gains. The vice president was put in charge of those negotiations by
###313 President Obama, and they failed to get the agreement. We don’t have a Status of Forces
###318 Agreement because they failed to get one. That’s what we are talking about.
###322 And when it comes to our veterans, we owe them a great debt of gratitude for what they’ve
###327 done for us, including your son Beau. But we also want to make sure that we don’t
###333 lose the things we fought so hard to get.
###334 And with respect to Afghanistan and the 2014 deadline, we agree with a 2014 transition.
###339 But what we also want to do is make sure that we’re not projecting weakness abroad, and
###343 that’s what’s happening here. This Benghazi issue would be a tragedy in and of itself.
###350 But unfortunately it’s indicative of a broader problem, and that is what we are watching
###354 on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy, which is making the
###359 world more -- more chaotic and us less safe.
###361 MS. RADDATZ: I just want to talk to you about right in the middle of the crisis. Governor
###366 Romney -- and you’re talking about this again tonight -- talked about the weakness,
###370 talked about apologies from the Obama administration. Was that really appropriate right in the middle
###376 of the crisis?
###377 REP. RYAN: On that same day, the Obama administration had the exact same position. Let’s recall
###383 that they disavowed their own statement that they had put out earlier in the day in Cairo.
###388 So we had the same position, but we will -- it’s never to early to speak out for our values.
###393 We should have spoken out right away when the Green Revolution was up and starting,
###397 when the mullahs in Iran were attacking their people. We should not have called Bashar Assad
###402 a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people. We should always stand
###408 up for peace, for democracy, for individual rights, and we should not be imposing these
###413 devastating defense cuts, because what that does when we equivocate on our values, when
###419 we show that we’re cutting our own defense --
###420 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Am I going to get to say anything here?
###421 REP. RYAN: -- it makes us more weak. It projects weakness, and when we look weak, our adversaries
###425 are much more willing to test us, they’re more brazen in their attacks, and our allies
###428 are less willing to --
###429 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: With all due respect, that’s a bunch of malarkey. In fact --
###432 MS. RADDATZ: And why is that so?
###433 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Because not a single thing he said is accurate. First of all --
###436 MS. RADDATZ: Be specific.
###436 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I will be very specific. Number one, the -- this lecture on embassy
###441 security -- the congressman here cut embassy security in his budget by $300 million below
###449 what we asked for, number one. So much for the embassy security piece.
###453 Number two, Governor Romney, before he knew the facts, before he even knew that our ambassador
###459 was killed, he was out making a political statement which was panned by the media around
###464 the world. And this talk about this -- this weakness, I -- I don’t understand what my
###471 friend’s talking about here.
###472 We -- this is a president who’s gone out and done everything he has said he was going
###476 to do. This is the guy who’s repaired our alliances so the rest of the world follows
###480 us again. This is the guy who brought the entire world, including Russia and China,
###480 to bring about the most devastating, most devastating -- the most devastating efforts
###489 on Iran to make sure that they in fact stop with their -- look, I -- I -- I just -- I
###495 mean, these guys bet against America all the time.
###497 REP. RYAN: I --
###497 MS. RADDATZ: Can we talk about -- let me go back to Libya.
###499 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Yeah, sure.
###500 MS. RADDATZ: What were you first told about the attack? Why were people talking about
###507 protests? When people in the consulate first saw armed men attacking with guns, there were
###513 no protesters. Why did that go on for weeks?
###516 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Because that’s exactly what we were told --
###517 MS. RADDATZ: By who?
###518 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- by the intelligence community. The intelligence community told
###521 us that. As they learned more facts about exactly what happened, they changed their
###526 assessment. That’s why there’s also an investigation headed by Tom Pickering, a leading
###531 diplomat in the -- from the Reagan years, who is doing an investigation as to whether
###535 or not there were any lapses, what the lapses were, so that they will never happen again.
###539 But --
###539 MS. RADDATZ: And they wanted more security there.
###540 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, we weren’t told they wanted more security again. We did not
###544 know they wanted more security again. And by the way, at the time we were told exactly
###550 -- we said exactly what the intelligence community told us that they knew. That was the assessment.
###556 And as the intelligence community changed their view, we made it clear they changed
###560 their view. That’s why I said, we will get to the bottom of this.
###563 You know, usually when there’s a crisis, we pull together. We pull together as a nation.
###567 But as I said, even before we knew what happened to the ambassador, the governor was holding
###572 a press conference -- was holding a press conference. That’s not presidential leadership.
###576 MS. RADDATZ: Mr. Ryan, I want to ask you about -- the Romney campaign talks a lot about no
###581 apologies. He has a book called “No Apologies.” Should the U.S. have apologized for Americans
###587 burning Qurans in Afghanistan? Should the U.S. apologize for U.S. Marines urinating
###593 on Taliban corpses?
###594 REP. RYAN: Oh, gosh, yes. Urinating on Taliban corpses? What we should not apologize for
###600 --
###600 MS. RADDATZ: Burning Qurans (immediately ?)?
###600 REP. RYAN: What -- what we should not be apologizing for are standing up for our values. What we
###605 should not be doing is saying to the Egyptian people, while Mubarak is cracking down on
###611 them, that he’s a good guy and then the next week say he ought to go. What we should
###614 not be doing is rejecting claims for -- calls for more security in our barracks, in our
###620 Marine -- we need Marines in Benghazi when the commander on the ground says we need more
###626 forces for security.
###627 There were requests for extra security. Those requests were not honored.
###630 Look, this was the anniversary of 9/11. It was Libya, a country we knew we had al-Qaida
###637 cells there. As we know, al-Qaida and its affiliates are on the rise in northern Africa.
###643 And we did not give our ambassador in Benghazi a Marine detachment? Of course there is an
###649 investigation so we can make sure that this never happens again. But when it comes to
###653 speaking up for our values, we should not apologize for those.
###656 Here is the problem. Look at all the various issues out there and that’s unraveling before
###660 our eyes. The vice president talks about sanctions on Iran. They got -- we’ve had four --
###665 MS. RADDATZ: Let’s move to Iran. I’d actually like to move to Iran because there is really
###669 no bigger national security --
###671 REP. RYAN: Absolutely.
###671 MS. RADDATZ: -- this country is facing. Both President Obama and Governor Romney have said
###675 they will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, even if that means military action.
###681 Last week former Defense Secretary Bob Gates said a strike on Iran’s facilities would
###686 not work and, quote, could prove catastrophic, haunting us for generations. Can the two of
###693 you be absolutely clear and specific to the American people how effective would a military
###700 strike be? Congressman Ryan.
###701 REP. RYAN: We cannot allow Iran to gain a nuclear weapons capability.
###706 Now, let’s take a look at where we’ve gone -- come from. When Barack Obama was elected,
###712 they had enough fissile material, nuclear material, to make one bomb. Now they have
###716 enough for five. They’re racing toward a nuclear weapon. They’re four years closer
###720 toward a nuclear weapons capability. We’ve had four different sanctions at the U.N. on
###724 Iran, three from the Bush administration, one here. And the only reason we got it is
###728 because Russia watered it down and prevented the -- the sanctions from hitting the central
###732 bank.
###734 Mitt Romney proposed these sanctions in 2007. In Congress, I’ve been fighting for these
###737 sanctions since 2009. The administration was blocking us every step of the way.
###742 Only because we had strong bipartisan support for these tough sanctions were we able to
###746 overrule their objections and put them in spite of the administration. Imagine what
###750 would have happened if we had these sanctions in place earlier. You think Iran’s not brazen?
###755 Look at what they’re doing. They’re stepping up their terrorist attacks. They tried a terrorist
###759 attack in the United States last year when they tried to blow up the Saudi ambassador
###763 at a restaurant in Washington, D.C.
###765 And talk about credibility. When this administration says that all options are on the table, they
###771 send out senior administration officials that send all these mixed signals.
###775 And so in order solve this peacefully, which is everybody’s goal, you have to have the
###780 ayatollahs change their minds. Look at where they are. They’re moving faster toward a
###785 nuclear weapon. It’s because this administration has no credibility on this issue. It’s because
###789 this administration watered down sanctions, delayed sanctions, tried to stop us from putting
###794 the tough sanctions in place. Now we have them in place because of Congress. They say
###798 the military option’s on the table but it’s not being viewed as credible, and the key
###802 is to do this peacefully, is to make sure that we have credibility. Under a Romney administration,
###808 we will have credibility on this issue.
###809 MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.
###811 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Incredible. (Chuckles.)
###813 Look, imagine had we let the Republican Congress work out the sanctions. You think there’s
###819 any possibility the entire world would have joined us, Russia and China, all of our allies?
###826 These are the most crippling sanctions in the history of sanctions, period, period.
###832 When Governor Romney’s asked about it, he said, we got to keep these sanctions. When
###837 they said, well, you’re talking about doing more, what are you -- are you -- you’re
###839 going to go to war? Is that you want to do now?
###841 REP. RYAN: We want to prevent war!
###842 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Inaudible) -- and I -- the interesting thing is, how they’re
###844 going to prevent war. How are they going to prevent war if they say that there’s nothing
###847 more that we -- that they say we should do than what we’ve already done, number one?
###852 And number two, with regard to the ability of the United States to take action militarily,
###857 it is -- it is not in my purview to talk about classified information.
###862 But we feel quite confident we could deal a serious blow to the Iranians. But number
###868 two, the Iranians are -- the Israelis and the United States -- our military and intelligence
###874 communities are absolutely the same exact place in terms of how close -- how close the
###880 Iranians are to getting a nuclear weapon. They are a good way away. There is no difference
###886 between our view and theirs.
###889 When my friend talks about fissile material, they have to take this highly enriched uranium,
###894 get it from 20 percent up. Then they have to be able to have something to put it in.
###899 There is no weapon that the Iranians have at this point. Both the Israelis and we know
###905 we’ll know if they start the process of building a weapon. So all this bluster I keep
###911 hearing, all this loose talk -- what are they talking about? Are you talking about to be
###916 more credible? What -- what more can the president do? Stand before the United Nations, tell
###921 the whole world, directly communicate to the ayatollah: We will not let them acquire a
###927 nuclear weapon, period, unless he’s talking about going to war.
###931 REP. RYAN: Martha, let’s just --
###932 MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.
###932 REP. RYAN: -- let’s look at this from the view of the ayatollahs. What do they see?
###938 They see this administration trying to water down sanctions in Congress for over two years.
###943 They’re moving faster toward a nuclear weapon; they’re spinning the centrifuges faster.
###948 They see us saying, when we come into the administration, when they’re sworn in, we
###952 need more space with our ally Israel. They see President Obama in New York City the same
###957 day Bibi Netanyahu is, and he’s -- instead of meeting with him goes on a -- on a daily
###962 talk show. They see -- when we say that these options are on the table, the secretary of
###968 defense walked them back. They are not changing their mind. That’s what we have to do, is
###974 change their mind so they stop pursuing nuclear weapons, and they’re going faster.
###976 MS. RADDATZ: How will you do it so quickly? Look, you both saw Benjamin Netanyahu hold
###982 up that picture of a bomb with the red line and talking about the red line being in spring.
###989 So can you solve this -- if the Romney-Ryan ticket is elected, can you solve this in two
###995 months before spring and avoid nuclear --
###998 REP. RYAN: We -- we can debate a timeline.
###1001 MS. RADDATZ: (Inaudible.)
###1001 REP. RYAN: We can debate the timeline, whether there’s -- it’s that short a time or longer.
###1004 I -- I agree that it’s probably longer. Number two, it’s all about credibility.
###1009 MS. RADDATZ: You don’t agree with that bomb and what the Israelis --
###1010 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No, look -- (inaudible) --
###1011 REP. RYAN: (Inaudible) -- look, we -- we both -- (inaudible) --
###1012 MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.
###1012 REP. RYAN: I don’t want to go into classified stuff, but we both agree that to do this peacefully,
###1018 you’ve got to get them to change their minds. They’re not changing their minds, and look
###1022 at what this administration does --
###1022 MS. RADDATZ: But what do you do -- (inaudible) --
###1023 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me tell you what the ayatollah sees.
###1024 REP. RYAN: You have to have credibility.
###1025 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The ayatollah sees his economy being crippled. The ayatollah sees
###1030 that there are 50 percent fewer exports of oil. He sees the currency going into the tank.
###1037 He sees the economy going into free fall, and he sees the world for the first time totally
###1041 united in opposition to him getting a nuclear weapon.
###1045 Now, with regard to Bibi, he’s been my friend for 39 years. The president has met with Bibi
###1049 a dozen times. He’s spoken to Bibi Netanyahu as much as he’s spoken to anybody. The idea
###1055 that we’re not -- I was in a -- just before he went to the U.N., I was in a conference
###1059 call with the -- with the president, with him talking to Bibi, for well over an hour
###1064 in -- in -- in -- in -- in stark relief and detail about what was going on. This is a
###1069 bunch of stuff. Look, here’s the deal --
###1071 MS. RADDATZ: What does that mean, “a bunch of stuff”?
###1073 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, it means it’s simply inaccurate.
###1074 REP. RYAN: It’s Irish. (Chuckles.)
###1076 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: It is. (Laughter.) We Irish call it malarkey.
###1078 MS. RADDATZ: Thanks for the translation. OK.
###1079 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No, we Irish call it malarkey. (Laughter.) But last thing: the
###1082 secretary of defense has made it absolutely clear. He didn’t walk anything back. We
###1087 will not allow the Iranians to get a nuclear weapon. What Bibi held up there was when they
###1094 get to the point where they can enrich uranium enough to put into a weapon, they don’t
###1100 have a weapon to put it into.
###1102 Let’s all calm down a little bit here. Iran is more isolated today than when we took office.
###1109 It was on the ascendancy when we took office. It is totally isolated.
###1112 MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan --
###1113 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I don’t know what world you guys are in.
###1115 MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan --
###1115 REP. RYAN: Thank -- thank heavens we have these sanctions in place. It’s in spite
###1118 of their opposition.
###1119 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) Oh, God.
###1119 REP. RYAN: They have given 20 waivers to this sanction. And all I have to point to are the
###1124 results. They’re four years closer toward a nuclear weapon. I think that case speaks
###1129 for itself.
###1129 MS. RADDATZ: Can you tell the American people what’s worse --
###1130 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: By the way, they’re -- no, no, they are not four years closer
###1131 to a nuclear weapon.
###1131 MS. RADDATZ: -- another war in the Middle East or --
###1134 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: They’re -- they’re closer to being able to get enough fissile
###1137 material to put in a weapon if they had a weapon. But --
###1140 MS. RADDATZ: You’re acting a little bit like they don’t want one, though.
###1142 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Oh, I didn’t say -- no, I’m not saying -- (look ?), facts matter,
###1146 Martha. You’re a foreign policy expert. Facts matter. All this loose talk about them
###1151 -- all they have to do is get to -- enrich uranium in a certain amount and they have
###1155 a weapon -- not true. Not true. They are more -- and if we ever have to take action, unlike
###1163 where we took office, we will have the world behind us, and that matters. That matters.
###1168 MS. RADDATZ: What about Bob Gates’ statement? Let me read that again: “Could prove catastrophic,
###1174 haunting us for generations.”
###1176 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: He is right. It could prove catastrophic if we do -- we do it with
###1180 -- (inaudible) --
###1180 MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan?
###1181 REP. RYAN: And what it does is it -- and it undermines our credibility by backing up the
###1185 point when we make it that all options are on the table. That’s the point. The ayatollahs
###1190 see these kinds of statements, and they think, I’m going to get a nuclear weapon. When
###1195 -- when we see the kind of equivocation that took place because this administration wanted
###1201 a precondition policy -- so when the Green Revolution started up, they were silent for
###1206 nine days. When they see us putting -- when they see us putting daylight between ourselves
###1213 and our allies in Israel, that gives them encouragement. When they see Russia watering
###1218 down any further sanctions -- and the only reason we got a U.N. sanction is because Russia
###1222 watered it down and prevented these -- (there ?) from being sanctions in the first place.
###1226 So when they see this kind of activity, they are encouraged to continue, and that’s the
###1230 problem.
###1230 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, let me tell you what Russia’s -- (inaudible) --
###1231 MS. RADDATZ: What -- let me ask you what’s worse: war in the Middle East, another war
###1235 in the Middle East, or a nuclear-armed Iran?
###1237 REP. RYAN: I’ll tell you what’s worse. I’ll tell you what’s worse.
###1239 MS. RADDATZ: Quickly.
###1239 REP. RYAN: A nuclear-armed Iran, which triggers a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. This
###1244 is the world’s largest sponsor of -- of terrorism. They’ve dedicated themselves
###1247 --
###1247 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s the only thing my --
###1248 REP. RYAN: -- to wiping an entire country off the map. They call us the Great Satan.
###1251 And if they get nuclear weapons, other people in the neighborhood will pursue their nuclear
###1255 weapons as well.
###1256 MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.
###1257 REP. RYAN: We can’t live with that.
###1258 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: War should always be the absolute last resort. That’s why these
###1264 crippling sanctions, what Bibi Netanyahu says we should continue -- which, if I’m not
###1270 mistaken, Governor Romney says we -- we should continue. If I -- I may be mistaken; he changes
###1275 his mind so often, I could be wrong. But the fact of the matter is, he says they’re working.
###1281 And the fact is that they are being crippled by them. And we’ve made it clear, big nations
###1287 can’t bluff. This president doesn’t bluff.
###1290 MS. RADDATZ: Gentlemen, I want to bring the conversation to a different kind of national
###1293 security issue, the state of our economy. The number one issue here at home is jobs.
###1300 The percentage of unemployed just fell below 8 percent for the first time in 43 months.
###1307 The Obama administration had projected that it would fall below 6 percent now after the
###1312 addition of close to a trillion dollars in stimulus money. So will both of you level
###1317 with the American people? Can you get unemployment to under 6 percent, and how long will it take?
###1323 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I don’t know how long it will take.
###1325 MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.
###1325 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: We can and we will get it under 6 percent.
###1328 Let’s look at the -- let’s take a look at the facts. Let’s look at where we were
###1332 when we came to office. The economy was in free fall. We had -- the Great Recession hit.
###1338 Nine million people lost their job, 1.7 -- $1.6 trillion in wealth lost in equity in your
###1347 homes, in retirement accounts from the middle class.
###1349 We knew we had to act for the middle class. We immediately went out and rescued General
###1353 Motors. We went ahead and made sure that we cut taxes for the middle class. And in addition
###1358 to that, when that -- and when that occurred, what did Romney do? Romney said, no, let Detroit
###1363 go bankrupt. We moved in and helped people refinance their homes. Governor Romney said,
###1368 no, let foreclosures hit the bottom.
###1370 But it shouldn’t be surprising for a guy who says 47 percent of the American people
###1374 are unwilling to take responsibility for their own lives. My friend recently, in a speech
###1379 in Washington, said 30% of the American people are takers. These people are my mom and dad,
###1384 the people I grew up with, my neighbors. They pay more effective tax than Governor Romney
###1389 pays in his federal income tax. They are elderly people who in fact are living off of Social
###1394 Security. They are veterans and people fighting in Afghanistan right now who are, quote, not
###1398 paying any taxes.
###1399 I’ve had it up to here with this notion that 47 percent -- it’s about time they
###1405 take some responsibility here. And instead of signing pledges to Grover Norquist not
###1410 to ask the wealthiest among us to contribute to bring back the middle class, they should
###1415 be signing a pledge saying to the middle class, we’re going to level the playing field.
###1418 We’re going to give you a fair shot again. We are going to not repeat the mistakes we
###1423 made in the past by having a different set of rules for Wall Street and Main Street,
###1429 making sure that we continue to hemorrhage these tax cuts for the superwealthy.
###1433 They’re pushing the continuation of a tax cut that will give an additional $500 billion
###1439 in tax cuts to 120,000 families. And they’re holding hostage the middle-class tax cut because
###1447 they say, we won’t pass -- we won’t continue the middle-class tax cut unless you give the
###1452 tax cut for the superwealthy. It’s about time they take some responsibility.
###1455 MS. RADDATZ: Mr. Ryan.
###1456 REP. RYAN: Joe and I are from similar towns.
###1459 He’s from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I’m from Janesville, Wisconsin. You know what
###1464 the unemployment rate in Scranton is today?
###1465 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I sure do.
###1466 REP. RYAN: It’s 10 percent.
###1467 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Yeah.
###1467 REP. RYAN: You know what it was the day you guys came in?
###1469 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No.
###1470 REP. RYAN: Eight-point-five percent.
###1471 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Yeah.
###1471 REP. RYAN: That’s how it’s going all around America.
###1474 Look --
###1474 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You don’t read the statistics. That’s not “how it’s going.”
###1476 It’s going down.
###1477 MS. RADDATZ: (Inaudible) -- two-minute answer, please.
###1478 REP. RYAN: Look -- (chuckles) -- did they come in and inherit a tough situation? Absolutely.
###1484 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)
###1484 REP. RYAN: But we’re going in the wrong direction! Look at where we are. The economy
###1489 is barely limping along. It’s growing at 1.3 percent. That’s slower than it grew
###1493 last year, and last year was slower than the year before. Job growth in September was slower
###1498 than it was in August, and August was slower than it was in July. We’re heading in the
###1503 wrong direction.
###1504 Twenty-three million Americans are struggling for work today. Fifteen percent of Americans
###1510 are living in poverty today. This is not what a real recovery looks like. We need real reforms
###1517 for a real recovery, and that’s exactly what Mitt Romney and I are proposing. It’s
###1521 five-point plan. Get America energy-independent in North America by the end of the decade.
###1525 Help people who are hurting get the skills they need to get the jobs they want. Get this
###1530 deficit and debt under control to prevent a debt crisis. Make trade work for America
###1533 so we can make more things in America and sell them overseas and champion small businesses.
###1538 Don’t raise taxes on small businesses, because they’re our job creators.
###1541 He talks about Detroit. Mitt Romney’s a car guy. They keep misquoting him, but let
###1547 me tell you about the Mitt Romney I know. This is a guy who -- I was talking to a family
###1553 in Northborough, Massachusetts the other day, Cheryl and Mark Nixon (sp). Their kids were
###1558 hit in a car crash, four of them -- two of them, Rob (sp) and Reid (sp), were paralyzed.
###1563 The Romneys didn’t know them. They went to the same church. They never met before.
###1567 Mitt asked if he could come over on Christmas. He brought his boys, his wife and gifts. Later
###1573 on he said, I know you’re struggling, Mark (sp). Don’t worry about their college; I’ll
###1577 pay for it.
###1579 When Mark (sp) told me this story -- because you know what, Mitt Romney doesn’t tell
###1581 these stories.
###1582 The Nixons told this story. When he told me this story, he said it wasn’t the help -- the
###1587 cash help; it’s that he gave his time, and he has consistently. This is a man who gave
###1592 30 percent of his income to charity, more than the two of us combined. Mitt Romney’s
###1596 a good man. He cares about a hundred percent of Americans in this country.
###1601 And with respect to that quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes
###1606 the words don’t come out of your mouth the right way. (Laughter.)
###1608 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: But I always say what I mean.
###1613 MS. RADDATZ: You --
###1613 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And so does Romney.
###1615 REP. RYAN: We want everybody to succeed. We want to get people out of poverty, in the
###1619 middle class, on to lives of self-sufficiency. We believe in opportunity and upward mobility.
###1623 That’s what we’re going to push for in a Romney administration.
###1625 MS. RADDATZ: Vice President?
###1626 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look --
###1627 MS. RADDATZ: I have a feeling you have a few things to say here. (Laughter.)
###1629 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) The idea, if you heard that -- that little soliloquy
###1634 on 47 percent, and you think he just made a mistake, then I think you’re -- I -- I
###1641 -- I -- I -- I got a bridge to sell you.
###1646 Look, I don’t doubt his personal generosity, and I understand what it’s like. When I
###1650 was a little younger than the congressman, my wife was in an accident, killed my daughter
###1655 and my wife, and my two sons survived. I have sat in the homes of many people who’ve gone
###1662 through what I get through because the one thing you can give people solace is to know
###1666 they know you’ve been through it, that they can make it. So I don’t doubt his personal
###1673 commitment to individuals.
###1674 But you know what, I know he had no commitment to the automobile industry. He just let -- he
###1680 said, let it go bankrupt, period, let it drop out. All this talk -- we saved a million jobs.
###1686 Two hundred thousand people are working today. And I have never met two guys who are more
###1690 down on America across the board. We’re told everything is going bad. We have 5.2
###1696 million new jobs, private sector jobs. We need more, but 5.2 million -- if they’d
###1700 get out of the way, if they get out of the way and let us pass the tax cut for the middle
###1705 class, make it permanent, if they get out of the way and pass the -- pass the jobs bill,
###1709 if they get out of the way and let us allow 14 million people who are struggling to stay
###1714 in their homes because their mortgages are upside-down, but they never missed a mortgage
###1717 payment -- just get out of the way.
###1720 Stop talking about how you care about people. Show me something. Show me a policy. Show
###1725 me a policy where you take responsibility.
###1729 And by the way, they talk about this Great Recession if it fell out of the sky, like,
###1733 oh my goodness, where did it come from? It came from this man voting to put two wars
###1738 in a credit card, to at the same time put a prescription drug benefit on the credit
###1743 card, a trillion- dollar tax cut for a -- very wealthy. I was there. I voted against him.
###1748 I said, no, we can’t afford that. And now all of a sudden these guys are so seized with
###1754 a concern about the debt that they created --
###1757 MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.
###1758 REP. RYAN: Let’s not forget that they came in with one-party control. When Barack Obama
###1765 was elected, his party controlled everything. They had the ability to do everything of their
###1769 choosing, and look at where we are right now. They passed a stimulus, the idea that we could
###1774 borrow $831 billion, spend it on all these special interest groups and that it would
###1778 work out just fine, that unemployment would never get to 8 percent. It went up above 8
###1783 percent for 43 months. They said that right now, if we just pass this stimulus, the economy
###1787 would grow at 4 percent. It’s growing at 1.3 (percent).
###1789 MS. RADDATZ: When could you get it below 6 percent?
###1792 REP. RYAN: That’s what our entire premise of our pro-growth plan for a stronger middle
###1795 class is all about: getting the economy growing at 4 percent, creating 12 million jobs over
###1800 the next four years. Look at just the $90 billion in stimulus, and -- and the vice president
###1805 was in charge of overseeing this, $90 billion in green pork to campaign contributors and
###1810 special interest groups. There are just at the Department of Energy over 100 criminal
###1815 investigations that have been launched into just how --
###1817 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha --
###1818 REP. RYAN: -- stimulus -- (inaudible) -- are being spent --
###1819 MS. RADDATZ: Go ahead.
###1820 Go ahead, Vice --
###1820 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, look. His colleague runs an investigative committee --
###1823 REP. RYAN: Crony capitalism -- (inaudible).
###1824 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- spent months and months and months going into this --
###1826 REP. RYAN: This is the -- this is the inspector general.
###1827 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- months and months. They found no evidence of cronyism. And I
###1832 love my friend here. I -- I’m not allowed to show letters, but go on our website: He
###1837 sent me two letters saying, by the way, can you send me some stimulus money for companies
###1842 here in the state of Wisconsin? We sent millions of dollars. You know why he said he needed
###1847 --
###1847 MS. RADDATZ: You did ask for stimulus money, correct?
###1848 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Sure he did. By the way -- (inaudible) --
###1850 REP. RYAN: On two occasions, we -- we -- we advocated for constituents who were applying
###1853 for grants.
###1854 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)
###1854 REP. RYAN: That’s what we do. We do that for all constituents who are -- (inaudible)
###1857 -- for grants.
###1857 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I love that. I love that. This is such a bad program, and he writes
###1860 me a letter saying -- writes the Department of Energy a letter saying, the reason we need
###1864 this stimulus -- it will create growth and jobs. He -- his words. And now he’s sitting
###1870 here looking at me -- and by the way, that program -- again, investigated -- what the
###1875 Congress said was, it was a model: less than four-tenths of 1 percent waste or fraud in
###1882 the program. And all this talk about cronyism -- they investigated, investigated; did not
###1887 find one single piece of evidence. I wish he would just tell -- be a little more candid.
###1892 REP. RYAN: Was it a good idea to spend taxpayer dollars on electric cars in Finland or on
###1898 windmills in China?
###1899 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look --
###1899 REP. RYAN: Was it a good idea to borrow all this money from countries like China --
###1903 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)
###1903 REP. RYAN: -- and spend it on all these various different interest groups?
###1906 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me tell you it was a good idea. It was a good idea -- Moody’s
###1908 and others said that this was exactly what we needed that stopped us from going off the
###1912 cliff. It set the conditions to be able to grow again. We have -- in fact, 4 percent
###1917 of those green jobs didn’t go under -- or went -- went -- went under -- didn’t work.
###1921 It’s a better batting average than investment bankers have. They have about a 40 percent
###1925 -- (inaudible) -- loss.
###1925 REP. RYAN: Where are the 5 million green jobs that were being promised --
###1928 MS. RADDATZ: I want to move on here to Medicare and entitlements. I think we’ve gone over
###1932 this quite enough. And both --
###1933 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And by the way, any letter you send me I’ll entertain.
###1935 REP. RYAN: I appreciate that, Joe. (Laughter.)
###1938 MS. RADDATZ: Let’s talk about Medicare and entitlements.
###1941 Both Medicare and Social Security are going broke and taking a larger share of the budget
###1946 in the process. Will benefits for Americans under these programs have to change for the
###1952 programs to survive, Mr. Ryan?
###1954 REP. RYAN: Absolutely. Medicare and Social Security are going bankrupt. These are indisputable
###1958 facts.
###1959 Look, when I look at these programs, we’ve all had tragedies in our lives. I think about
###1964 what they’ve done for my own family. My mom and I had my grandmother move in with
###1969 us who was facing Alzheimer’s. Medicare was there for her, just like it’s there
###1972 for my mom right now who’s a Florida senior. After my dad died, my mom and I got Social
###1977 Security survivors benefits. Helped me pay for college. It helped her go back to college
###1980 in her 50s, where she started a small business because of the new skills she got. She paid
###1986 all of her taxes on the promise that these programs would be there for her. We will honor
###1991 this promise.
###1992 And the best way to do it is reform it for my generation. You see, if you reform these
###1997 programs for my generation, people 54 and below, you can guarantee they don’t change
###2002 for people in or near retirement, which is precisely what Mitt Romney and I are proposing.
###2006 Look at what -- look what “Obamacare” does. “Obamacare” takes $716 billion from
###2012 Medicare to spend on “Obamacare.” Even their own chief actuary at Medicare backs
###2017 this up. He says you can’t spend the same dollar twice. You can’t claim that this
###2020 money goes to Medicare and “Obamacare.”
###2024 And then they put this new “Obamacare” board in charge of cutting Medicare each and
###2028 every year in ways that will lead to denied care for current seniors. This board, by the
###2032 way, it’s 15 people. The president’s supposed to appoint them next year. And not one of
###2037 them even has to have medical training.
###2038 And Social Security, if we don’t shore up Social Security, when we run out of the IOUs,
###2043 when the program goes bankrupt, a 25 percent across-the-board benefit cut kicks in on current
###2048 seniors in the middle of their retirement. We’re going to stop that from happening.
###2053 They haven’t put a credible solution on the table. He’ll tell you about vouchers.
###2057 He’ll say all these things to try and scare people.
###2060 Here’s what we’re saying: Give younger people, when they become Medicare-eligible,
###2064 guaranteed coverage options that you can’t be denied, including traditional Medicare.
###2070 Choose your plan, and then Medicare subsidizes your premiums, not as much for the wealthy
###2074 people, more coverage for middle-income people and total out-of-pocket coverage for the poor
###2079 and the sick. Choice and competition -- we would rather have 50 million future seniors
###2084 determine how their Medicare is delivered to them instead of 15 bureaucrats deciding
###2088 what -- if, where, when they get it.
###2090 MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden, two minutes.
###2091 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You know, I heard that death panel argument from Sarah Palin. It
###2094 seems that every vice presidential debate, I hear this kind of stuff about panels. But
###2098 let’s talk about Medicare.
###2100 What we did is we saved $716 billion and put it back -- applied it to Medicare. We cut
###2107 the cost of Medicare. We stopped overpaying insurance companies when doctors and hospitals
###2113 -- the AMA supported what we did. AARP endorsed what we did. And it extends the life of Medicare
###2120 to 2024. They want to wipe this all out. It also gave more benefits. Any senior out there,
###2127 ask yourself: Do you have more benefits today? You do. If you’re near the doughnut hole,
###2131 you have $600 more to help your prescription drug costs. You get wellness visits without
###2136 copays. They wipe all of this out, and Medicare goes -- becomes insolvent in 2016, number
###2142 one.
###2143 Number two, guaranteed benefit -- it’s a voucher. When they first proposed -- when
###2148 the congressman had his first voucher program, the CBO said it would cost $6,400 a year,
###2156 Martha, more for every senior 55 and below when they got there. He knew that, yet he
###2163 got it -- all the guys in Congress, and women in the Republican party to vote for it. Governor
###2168 Romney, knowing that, said, I -- I -- I would sign it were I there. Who you believe, the
###2174 AMA? Me? A guy who’s fought his whole life for this? Or somebody who had actually put
###2180 in motion a plan that knowingly cut -- added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?
###2188 Now they got a new plan. Trust me, it’s not going to cost you any more. Folks, follow
###2193 your instincts on this one.
###2195 And with regard to Social Security, we will not -- we will not privatize it. If we had
###2200 listened to Romney, to Governor Romney and the congressman during the Bush years, imagine
###2205 where all those seniors would be now if their money had been in the market. Their ideas
###2211 are old, and their ideas are bad, and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare.
###2215 REP. RYAN: Here’s the problem. They got caught with their hands in the cookie jar
###2220 turning Medicare into a piggy bank for “Obamacare”. Their own actuary from the administration
###2226 came to Congress and said one out of six hospitals and nursing homes are going to go out of business
###2231 as a result of this.
###2232 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s not what they said.
###2232 REP. RYAN: Seven point four million seniors are projected to lose the current Medicare
###2236 Advantage coverage they have. That’s a $3,200 benefit cut.
###2239 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That didn’t happen.
###2240 REP. RYAN: What we’re saying --
###2241 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: More people signed up.
###2242 REP. RYAN: These are from your own actuaries.
###2243 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: More -- more -- more people signed up for Medicare Advantage after
###2246 the change.
###2246 REP. RYAN: What -- what they’re --
###2247 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No -- nobody is getting shut down.
###2248 REP. RYAN: Mr. Vice President, I know --
###2248 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No -- no -- (inaudible) --
###2249 REP. RYAN: Mr. Vice President, I know you’re under a lot of duress -- (laughter) -- to
###2253 make up for lost ground -- (laughter) -- but I think people would be better served if we
###2257 don’t keep interrupting each other.
###2258 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, don’t take all the four minutes, then.
###2260 REP. RYAN: Now let me just -- let me say this. We are not -- we are saying, don’t change
###2263 benefits for people 55 and above. They already organized their retirement around these promises.
###2267 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: They already are --
###2267 REP. RYAN: But you want to -- (inaudible) -- these programs for those of us --
###2267 MS. RADDATZ: Let me ask you this: what is your specific plan for seniors who really
###2273 can’t afford to make up the difference in the value of what you call a premium support
###2278 plan and others call a voucher?
###2280 REP. RYAN: A hundred percent coverage for them.
###2281 MS. RADDATZ: And what --
###2281 REP. RYAN: That’s what we’re saying.
###2282 MS. RADDATZ: -- what cost --
###2283 REP. RYAN: So we’re saying income-adjust --
###2284 MS. RADDATZ: How do you make that up?
###2285 REP. RYAN: -- these premium support payments by taking down the subsidies for wealthy people.
###2289 Look, this is a plan -- by the way, that $6,400 number, it was misleading then. It’s totally
###2294 inaccurate now. This is a plan that’s bipartisan. It’s a plan I put together with a prominent
###2300 Democrat senator from Oregon.
###2301 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: There’s not one Democrat who endorsed his --
###2303 REP. RYAN: It’s a plan --
###2303 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- not one Democrat who signed his plan.
###2305 REP. RYAN: Our partner is a Democrat from Oregon.
###2307 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And he said he does no longer support (you for that ?).
###2309 REP. RYAN: We -- we put it -- we put it together with the former Clinton budget director.
###2311 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Who disavows it. (Chuckles.)
###2312 REP. RYAN: This idea -- this idea came from the Clinton commission to save Medicare, chaired
###2318 by Senator John Breaux. Here’s the point, Martha.
###2320 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Which was rejected.
###2321 REP. RYAN: If we don’t -- if we don’t fix this problem pretty soon, then current
###2325 seniors get cut! Here’s the problem. Ten thousand people are retiring every single
###2329 day in America today, and they will for 20 years. That’s not a political thing. That’s
###2333 a math thing.
###2333 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, if we just did one thing, if we just -- if they allow Medicare
###2337 to bargain for the cost of drugs like Medicaid can, that would save $156 billion right off
###2345 the bat.
###2345 REP. RYAN: And it would deny seniors choices.
###2346 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: All -- all -- all --
###2347 REP. RYAN: It -- it has restricted (formula ?) --
###2349 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Seniors are not denied.
###2350 REP. RYAN: Absolutely.
###2350 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Sorry, they are not denied.
###2352 Look, folks, and all you seniors out there, have you been denied choices? Have you lost
###2357 Medicare Advantage or, if you have signed up --
###2358 REP. RYAN: Because it’s working well right now.
###2359 VICE RESIDENT BIDEN: Because we changed the law!
###2360 MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden, let me ask you, if it could help solve the problem,
###2365 why not very slowly raise the Medicare eligibility age by two years, as Congressman Ryan suggests?
###2371 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look, I was there when we did that with Social Security, in 1983.
###2375 I was one of eight people sitting in the room that included Tip O’Neill negotiating with
###2380 President Reagan. We all got together, and everybody said, as long as everybody’s in
###2384 the deal, everybody’s in the deal, and everybody is making some sacrifice, we can find a way.
###2390 We made the system solvent to 2033.
###2395 We will not, though, be part of any voucher plan eliminating -- the voucher says, Mom,
###2401 when you’re -- when you’re 65, go out there, shop for the best insurance you can
###2406 get; you’re out of Medicare. You can buy back in, if you want, with this voucher, which
###2410 will not keep pace -- will not keep pace with health care costs, because if it did keep
###2414 pace with health care costs, there would be no savings. That’s why they go the voucher
###2419 -- they -- we will be no part of a voucher program or the privatization of Social Security.
###2426 REP. RYAN: A voucher is you go to your mailbox, get a check and buy something. Nobody’s
###2430 proposing that. Barack Obama, four years ago, running for president, said if you don’t
###2436 have any fresh ideas, use stale tactics to scare voters. If you don’t have a good record
###2442 to run on, paint your opponent as someone people should run from. Make a big election
###2446 about small ideas.
###2446 MS. RADDATZ: You were one of the few lawmakers to stand with President Bush when he was seeking
###2451 to partially privatize Social Security.
###2452 REP. RYAN: For younger people. What we said then and what I’ve always agreed is let
###2457 younger Americans have a voluntary choice of making their money work faster for them
###2462 within the Social Security system.
###2463 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You saw how well that worked.
###2465 REP. RYAN: That’s not what Mitt Romney’s proposing. What we’re saying is no changes
###2467 for anybody 55 and above.
###2468 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: What Mitt Romney is proposing --
###2470 REP. RYAN: And then the kinds of the changes we’re talking about for younger people like
###2473 myself is don’t increase the benefits for wealthy people as fast as everybody else --
###2477 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha --
###2478 REP. RYAN: -- slowly raise the retirement age over time.
###2480 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha --
###2480 REP. RYAN: It wouldn’t get to the age of 70 until the year 2103, according to the actuaries.
###2485 Now, here’s the issue.
###2486 MS. RADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President.
###2487 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Quickly, the bottom line here is that all the studies show that
###2490 if we went with Social Security proposal made by Mitt Romney, if you’re 40 -- in your
###2495 40s now, you will pay $2,600 a year -- you get $2,600 a year less in Social Security.
###2501 If you’re in your 20s now, you get $4,700 a year less. The idea of changing -- and change
###2507 being, in this case, to cut the benefits for people without taking other action you could
###2512 do to make it work -- is absolutely the wrong way.
###2515 These -- look, these guys haven’t been big on Medicare from the beginning. Their party’s
###2520 not been big on Medicare from the beginning. And they’ve always been about Social Security
###2524 as little as you can do. Look, folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this?
###2529 A man who introduced a bill that would raise it $6,400 a year, knowing it and passing it,
###2537 and Romney saying he’d sign it? Or me and the president?
###2540 REP. RYAN: That statistic was completely misleading. But more importantly --
###2543 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s -- there are the facts, right?
###2544 REP. RYAN: -- this is -- this is what politicians do when they don’t have a record to run
###2547 on: try to scare people from voting for you. If you don’t get ahead of this problem,
###2553 it’s going to -- (inaudible) --
###2553 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Medicare beneficiaries have more benefits now -- (inaudible) --
###2556 REP. RYAN: We are not going to run away -- we are not going to run away --
###2556 MS. RADDATZ: OK. We’re going to -- we’re going to move on to a very simple question
###2558 to you both.
###2559 REP. RYAN: Medicare and Social Security did so much for my own family. We are not going
###2562 to jeopardize this program, but we have to save it for the next generation so it doesn’t
###2565 go bankrupt.
###2565 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You are jeopardizing the program. You’re changing the program
###2568 from a guaranteed benefit to a premium support. Whatever you call it, the bottom line is people
###2573 are going to have to pay more money out of their pocket.
###2575 REP. RYAN: The wealthy would.
###2575 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And the families I know and the families I come from -- they don’t
###2578 have the money to pay more out of -- (inaudible).
###2580 MS. RADDATZ: Gentlemen, gentlemen --
###2581 REP. RYAN: That’s why we’re saying more for lower-income people and less for higher-income
###2583 people.
###2583 MS. RADDATZ: I would like to move on to a very simple question for both of you. And
###2587 something tells me --
###2588 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)
###2588 MS. RADDATZ: -- I won’t get a very simple answer. But let me ask you this.
###2592 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I gave you a simple answer: He’s raising the cost of Medicare.
###2594 MS. RADDATZ: OK, on to taxes. If your ticket is elected, who will pay more in taxes? Who
###2600 will pay less? And we’re starting with Vice President Biden for two minutes.
###2603 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The middle class will pay less, and people making a million dollars
###2607 or more will begin to contribute slightly more. Let me give you one concrete example:
###2611 the continuation of the Bush tax cuts. We’re arguing that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy
###2616 should be allowed to expire. Of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, 800 million -- billion
###2622 dollars of that goes to people making a minimum of a million dollars. We see no justification
###2627 in these economic times for those -- and they’re patriotic Americans. They’re -- they’re
###2632 not asking for this continued tax cut; they’re not suggesting it; but my friends are insisting
###2637 on it. A hundred and twenty thousand families, by continuing that tax cut, will get an additional
###2643 $500 billion in tax relief in the next 10 years, and their income is an average of $8
###2649 million.
###2650 We want to extend permanently the middle-class tax cut for -- permanently from the Bush middle-class
###2657 tax cut. These guys won’t allow us to.
###2659 You what we’re saying? We say let’s have a vote. Let’s have a vote on the middle-class
###2663 tax cut, and let’s have a vote on the upper tax cut. Let’s go ahead and vote on it.
###2668 They’re saying no. They’re holding hostage the middle-class tax cut to the super wealthy.
###2673 And on top of that, they got another tax cut coming that’s $5 trillion that all of the
###2679 studies point out will, in fact, give another $250 million dollar -- yeah, $250,000 a year
###2686 to those 120,000 families and raise taxes for people who are middle-income with a child
###2692 by $2,000 a year. This is unconscionable. There is no need for this. The middle class
###2699 got knocked on their heels. The Great Recession crushed them. They need some help now. The
###2705 last people who need help are 120,000 families for another -- another $500 billion tax cut
###2713 over the next 10 years.
###2715 MS. RADDATZ: Congressman.
###2716 REP. RYAN: Our entire premise of these tax reform plans is to grow the economy and create
###2722 jobs. It’s a plan that’s estimated to create 7 million jobs.
###2726 Now, we think that government taking 28 percent of a family and business’ income is enough.
###2733 President Obama thinks that the government ought to be able to take as much as 44.8 percent
###2738 of a small business’ income.
###2741 Look, if you taxed every person in successful small business making over $250,000 at a hundred
###2748 percent, it’d only run the government for 98 days. If everybody who paid income taxes
###2753 last year, including successful small businesses, doubled their income taxes this year, we’d
###2757 still have a $300 billion deficit.
###2759 You see, there aren’t enough rich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all
###2765 their spending. And so the next time you hear them say, don’t worry about it, we’ll
###2770 get a few wealthy people to pay their fair share, watch out, middle class. The tax bill
###2774 is coming to you.
###2776 That’s why we’re saying we need fundamental tax reform.
###2780 Let’s take a look at it this way: 8-out-of-10 businesses, they file their taxes as individuals,
###2785 not as corporations. And where I come from, overseas, which is Lake Superior -- (chuckles)
###2790 -- the Canadians -- they drop their tax rates to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses
###2795 in the industrialized world is 25 percent, and the president wants the top effective
###2800 tax rate on successful small businesses to go above 40 percent. Two-thirds of our jobs
###2806 come from small businesses. This one tax would actually tax about 53 percent of small-business
###2812 income. It’s expected that’d cost us 710,000 jobs. And you know what? It doesn’t even
###2818 pay for 10 percent of their proposed deficit spending increases.
###2823 What we are saying is lower tax rates across the board and close loopholes, primarily to
###2827 the higher-income people. We have three bottom lines: Don’t raise the deficit, don’t
###2832 raise taxes on the middle class and don’t lower the share of income that is borne by
###2836 the high-income earners. He -- he’ll keep saying this $5 trillion plan, I suppose --
###2840 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)
###2841 REP. RYAN: -- it’s been discredited by six other studies, and even their own deputy campaign
###2846 manager acknowledged that it wasn’t correct.
###2848 MS. RADDATZ: Well, let’s talk about this 20 percent.
###2850 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well -- (chuckles) --
###2850 MS. RADDATZ: You have refused yet again to offer specifics on how you pay for that 20
###2857 percent across-the-board tax cut. Do you actually have the specifics, or are you still working
###2863 on it, and that’s why you won’t tell voters?
###2865 REP. RYAN: Different than this administration, we actually want to have big bipartisan agreements.
###2869 You see, I understand the --
###2871 MS. RADDATZ: Do you have the specifics? Do you have the math? Do you know exactly what
###2873 you’re doing?
###2873 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’ll be -- that’d be a first for the Republican Congress.
###2875 REP. RYAN: Look -- look at what Mitt -- look at what Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill did.
###2879 They worked together out of a framework to lower tax rates and broaden the base, and
###2884 they worked together to fix that. What we’re saying is here’s our framework: Lower tax
###2888 rates 20 percent -- we raise about $1.2 trillion through income taxes. We forgo about 1.1 trillion
###2895 (dollars) in loopholes and deductions. And so what we’re saying is deny those loopholes
###2900 and deductions to higher- income taxpayers so that more of their income is taxed, which
###2904 has a broader base of taxation --
###2906 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Can I translate?
###2906 REP. RYAN: -- so we can lower tax rates across the board.
###2908 Now, here’s why I’m saying this. What we’re saying is here’s a framework --
###2912 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I hope I’m going to get time to respond to this.
###2913 REP. RYAN: We want to work with Congress --
###2913 MS. RADDATZ: I -- you’ll get time.
###2914 REP. RYAN: We want to work with Congress on how best to achieve this. That means successful
###2919 -- look --
###2919 MS. RADDATZ: No specifics, yeah.
###2919 REP. RYAN: Mitt -- what we’re saying is -- (laughter) -- lower tax rates 20 percent,
###2924 start with the wealthy, work with Congress to do it --
###2926 MS. RADDATZ: And you guarantee this math will add up.
###2928 REP. RYAN: Absolutely. Six studies have guaranteed -- six studies have verified that this math
###2931 adds up, but here’s the other point --
###2932 MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden --
###2933 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look --
###2933 REP. RYAN: (Inaudible) -- one point -- (inaudible) --
###2933 MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.
###2934 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Let me translate. Let me have a chance to translate.
###2936 REP. RYAN: I’ll come back in a second then, right?
###2937 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: First of all, I was there when Ronald Reagan tax breaks -- I mean,
###2940 he gave specifics of what he was going to cut, no -- number one, in terms of tax expenditures.
###2945 Number two, 97 percent of the small businesses of America pay less -- make less than $250,000.
###2952 Let me tell you who some of those other small businesses are: hedge funds that make 6(00
###2956 million dollars), $800 million a year. That -- that’s what they count as small business
###2961 because they’re passthrough.
###2962 Let’s look at how sincere they are. Ronald -- I mean, excuse me, Governor Romney, on
###2967 “60 Minutes,” I guess it’s about 10 days ago, was asked, Governor, you pay 14
###2972 percent on $20 million. Someone making $50,000 pays more than that. Do you think that’s
###2977 fair? He said, oh, yes, that’s fair; that’s fair.
###2980 This is -- and they’re going to talk -- I mean, you think these guys are going to go
###2983 out there and cut those loopholes? The loophole -- the biggest loophole they take advantage
###2987 of is the carried interest loophole and -- and capital gains loophole. They exempt that.
###2992 Now, there’s not enough -- the reason why the AEI study, the American Enterprise Institute
###2997 study, the Tax Policy Center study, the reason they all say it’s going to -- taxes will
###3002 go up on the middle class, the only way you can find $5 trillion in loopholes is cut the
###3008 mortgage deduction for middle-class people, cut the health care deduction for middle-class
###3012 people, take away their ability to get a tax break to send their kids to college. That’s
###3018 why they -- (inaudible) --
###3018 MS. RADDATZ: Is he wrong about that?
###3019 REP. RYAN: He is wrong about that. There are -- you can --
###3022 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: How’s that?
###3022 REP. RYAN: You can cut tax rates by 20 percent and still preserve these important preferences
###3026 for middle-class taxpayers --
###3027 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Not mathematically possible.
###3029 REP. RYAN: It is mathematically possible. It’s been done before. It’s precisely
###3031 what we’re proposing.
###3032 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.) It has never been done before.
###3035 REP. RYAN: It’s been done a couple of times, actually.
###3036 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: It has never been done before.
###3037 REP. RYAN: Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates, increased growth. Ronald Reagan --
###3039 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Oh, now you’re Jack Kennedy.
###3040 REP. RYAN: Ronald Reagan -- (laughter) -- (chuckles) -- Republicans and Democrats --
###3045 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: This is amazing.
###3046 REP. RYAN: Republicans and Democrats have worked together on this.
###3048 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s right.
###3048 REP. RYAN: I understand aren’t used to doing bipartisan deals.
###3050 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: But we told each other what we were going to do. When we did with
###3052 Reagan, he said --
###3052 REP. RYAN: Republicans and Democrats --
###3053 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- here -- here are the things we’re going to cut. This is what
###3054 he said.
###3054 REP. RYAN: We can agree on a framework; let’s work together to fill in the details. That’s
###3057 exactly --
###3057 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Fill in the details.
###3057 REP. RYAN: That’s how you get things done. You work with Congress --
###3059 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Seriously ?).
###3060 REP. RYAN: Look, let me say it this way. Mitt Romney was governor --
###3063 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s coming from the Republican Congress working bipartisanly?
###3064 REP. RYAN: Mitt -- Mitt Romney --
###3065 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Seven percent rating? Come on.
###3067 REP. RYAN: Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, where 87 percent of the legislators he served
###3071 with were Democrats. He didn’t demonize them. He didn’t demagogue them. He met with
###3076 those party leaders every week.
###3077 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)
###3078 REP. RYAN: He reached across the aisle. He didn’t compromise principles.
###3081 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And you (saw what happened ?).
###3082 REP. RYAN: He found common ground, and he balanced the budget.
###3083 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (You saw what ?) -- if he did such a great job -- if he did such
###3088 a great job in Massachusetts --
###3088 MS. RADDATZ: Vice President, what --
###3088 REP. RYAN: He balanced the budget four times. He balanced the budget four times without
###3089 raising taxes.
###3089 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- why isn’t he even contesting Massachusetts?
###3090 REP. RYAN: (Inaudible.)
###3091 MS. RADDATZ: Vice President, what would you suggest -- what would you suggest beyond raising
###3094 taxes on the wealthy that would substantially reduce the long-term deficit?
###3097 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Not -- just let the taxes expire like they’re supposed to on
###3101 those millionaires. We don’t -- we can’t afford $800 billion going to people making
###3107 a minimum a million dollars. They do not need it, Martha. Those 120,000 families make $8
###3114 million a year. Middle-class people need the help. Why does my friend cut out the tuition
###3120 tax credit for them? Why does he go out after the child -- (inaudible)?
###3123 MS. RADDATZ: Can you declare anything off-limits --
###3124 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Why do they do that?
###3125 MS. RADDATZ: Can you declare anything off limits? Home mortgages deductions --
###3127 REP. RYAN: Yeah. We’re saying close loopholes on high-interest people--
###3129 MS. RADDATZ: Home mortgage deductions --
###3130 REP. RYAN: -- for higher-income people. Here --
###3131 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Can you guarantee that no one --
###3133 REP. RYAN: This taxes --
###3134 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- making less than $100,000 will have a mortgage --
###3136 REP. RYAN: This --
###3137 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- their mortgage deduction impacted? Guarantee?
###3138 REP. RYAN: This taxes a million small businesses.
###3141 He keeps trying to make you think that it’s just some movie star or hedge fund guy or
###3144 an actor--
###3145 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Ninety-seven percent of the small businesses make less than $250,000
###3148 a year --
###3149 REP. RYAN: Joe --
###3150 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- would not be affected.
###3152 REP. RYAN: -- you know, it hits a million -- this taxes a million people, a million
###3156 small businesses --
###3157 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Doesn’t tax 97 percent of the American businesses -- small businesses
###3159 --
###3159 REP. RYAN: It -- it taxes a million small businesses, who are our great job creators.
###3161 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I wish I’d get it -- the greatest job creators are the hedge
###3163 fund guys.
###3163 REP. RYAN: (Let’s end ?) --
###3164 MS. RADDATZ: And you’re going -- and you’re going to increase the defense budget.
###3165 REP. RYAN: Think about it this way.
###3166 MS. RADDATZ: And you’re going to increase the defense budget.
###3168 REP. RYAN: No, we’re just not going to cut the defense budget like they’re -- they’re
###3170 proposing --
###3170 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: They’re going to increase it $2 billion -- $2 trillion.
###3172 REP. RYAN: That’s not accurate. We’re talking about preventing --
###3174 MS. RADDATZ: More than that. No -- so no massive defense increase?
###3175 REP. RYAN: No, we’re saying is, don’t -- OK, you want to get into defense now?
###3178 MS. RADDATZ: Let -- yes, I do. I do --
###3179 REP. RYAN: All right. So --
###3180 MS. RADDATZ: -- because that’s another math question.
###3181 REP. RYAN: Right. OK.
###3182 MS. RADDATZ: How do you do that?
###3183 REP. RYAN: So they proposed a $478 (sic) billion cut to defense to begin with. Now we have
###3189 another $500 billion cut to defense that’s lurking on the horizon. They insisted upon
###3194 that cut being involved in the debt negotiations --
###3197 MS. RADDATZ: Let --
###3197 REP. RYAN: -- and now we have a $1 trillion cut --
###3199 MS. RADDATZ: Let’s put the automatic defense cuts aside. OK?
###3200 REP. RYAN: Right. OK.
###3201 MS. RADDATZ: Let’s put those aside. No one wants that.
###3202 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I’d like to go back to that.
###3203 REP. RYAN: OK.
###3203 MS. RADDATZ: But I want to know how you do the math and have this increase in defense
###3207 spending?
###3207 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Two trillion dollars.
###3208 REP. RYAN: You don’t cut defense by a trillion dollars. That’s what we’re talking about.
###3212 The additional trillion --
###3212 MS. RADDATZ: And what national security issues justify an increase?
###3216 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Who’s cutting it by a trillion?
###3219 REP. RYAN: We’re going to cut 80,000 soldiers, 20,000 Marines, 120 cargo planes. We’re
###3224 going to push the Joint Strike Fighter out.
###3225 MS. RADDATZ: Drawing down in one war --
###3227 REP. RYAN: We’re cutting missile defense.
###3227 MS. RADDATZ: -- and one war -- (inaudible ) --
###3228 REP. RYAN: If these cuts go through, our Navy will be the small it is -- it -- the smallest
###3232 it has been since before World War I. This invites weakness.
###3237 Look, do we believe in peace through strength? You bet we do. And that means you don’t
###3241 impose these devastating cuts on our military. So we’re saying don’t cut the military
###3246 by a trillion dollars, not increase it by a trillion, don’t cut it by a trillion dollars.
###3250 MS. RADDATZ: Quickly, Vice President Biden, on this, and I want to move on.
###3252 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Look, we don’t cut it. And I might add this so-called -- I know
###3255 we don’t want to use the fancy word “sequester,” this automatic cut -- that was part of a debt
###3260 deal that they asked for.
###3262 And let me tell you what my friend said at a press conference announcing his support
###3265 of the deal. He said -- and I’m -- we’ve been looking for this moment for a long time.
###3270 (Inaudible) --
###3270 REP. RYAN: Can I tell you what that meant?
###3272 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Why --
###3273 REP. RYAN: We’ve been looking for bipartisanship for a long time.
###3274 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And so the bipartisanship is what he voted for: the automatic cuts in
###3278 defense if they didn’t act. And beyond that, they asked for another -- look, the military
###3283 says, we need a smaller, leaner Army. We need more special forces. We need -- we don’t
###3290 need more M1 tanks. What we need is more UADs.
###3292 MS. RADDATZ: Some of the military -- I know that’s -- (inaudible) --
###3293 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Not some of the military; that was the decision of the Joint Chiefs
###3298 of Staff, recommended to us and agreed to by the president. That’s a fact.
###3302 MS. RADDATZ: Who answers to the civilian leaders.
###3303 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: They made the recommendation first.
###3306 MS. RADDATZ: OK. Let’s move on to Afghanistan.
###3308 REP. RYAN: Can I get into that for a second?
###3309 MS. RADDATZ: I’d like to move on to Afghanistan, please.
###3310 REP. RYAN: OK.
###3311 MS. RADDATZ: And that’s one of the biggest expenditures this country has made, in dollars
###3315 and, more importantly, in lives. We just passed the sad milestone of losing 2,000 U.S. troops
###3322 there in this war. More than 50 of them were killed this year by the very Afghan forces
###3328 we are trying to help. Now, we’ve reached the recruiting goal for Afghan forces. We’ve
###3334 degraded al-Qaida. So tell me, why not leave now? What more can we really accomplish? Is
###3341 it worth more American lives?
###3342 REP. RYAN: We don’t want to lose the gains we’ve gotten. We want to make sure that
###3347 the Taliban does not come back in and give al- Qaida a safe haven. We agree with the
###3352 administration on their 2014 transition. Look, when I think about Afghanistan, I think about
###3358 the incredible job that our troops have done. You’ve been there more than the two of us
###3362 combined.
###3363 First time I was there in 2002, it was amazing to me what they were facing. When I went to
###3368 the Arghandab Valley in Kandahar before the surge, I sat down with a young private in
###3374 the 82nd from the Menominee Indian Reservation who would tell me what he did every day, and
###3377 I was in awe. And to see what they had in front of them -- and then to go back there
###3381 in December, to go throughout Helmand with the Marines to see what they had accomplished
###3385 -- it’s nothing short of amazing.
###3388 What we don’t want to do is lose the gains we’ve gotten.
###3392 Now, we’ve disagreed from time to time on a few issues. We would have more likely taken
###3396 into account the recommendations from our commanders, General Petraeus, Admiral Mullen,
###3402 on troop levels throughout this year’s fighting season. We’ve been skeptical about negotiations
###3406 with the Taliban, especially while they’re shooting at us. But we want to see the 2014
###3411 transition be successful. And that means we want to make sure our commanders have what
###3417 they need to make sure that it is successful so that this does not once again become a
###3422 launching pad for terrorists.
###3423 MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.
###3424 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, let’s keep our eye on the ball. The reason I’ve been
###3428 in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq 20 times -- I’ve been up in the Kunar -- I’ve been
###3434 throughout that whole country, mostly in a helicopter and sometimes in a vehicle. The
###3440 fact is we went there for one reason: to get those people who killed Americans, al-Qaida.
###3446 We’ve decimated al-Qaida central. We have eliminated Osama bin Laden. That was our purpose.
###3454 And in fact, in the meantime, what we said we would do, we would help train the Afghan
###3459 military. It’s their responsibility to take over their own security. That’s why, with
###3466 49 of our allies in Afghanistan, we’ve agreed on a gradual drawdown so we’re out of there
###3473 by the year -- in the year 2014.
###3478 My friend and the governor say it’s based on conditions, which means it depends. It
###3483 does not depend for us. It is the responsibility of the Afghans to take care of their own security.
###3492 We have trained over 315,000, mostly without incident. There have been more than two dozen
###3498 cases of green on blue where Americans have been killed.
###3502 If we do -- if the -- if the measures the military has taken do not take hold, we will
###3507 not go on joint patrols, we will not train in the field. We’ll only train in the -- in
###3514 the Army bases that exist there.
###3517 But we are leaving. We are leaving in 2014, period, and in the process, we’re going
###3524 to be saving over the next 10 years another $800 billion. We’ve been in this war for
###3530 over a decade. The primary objective is almost completed. Now all we’re doing is putting
###3537 the Kabul government in a position to be able to maintain their own security. It’s their
###3543 responsibility, not America’s.
###3545 MS. RADDATZ: What conditions could justify staying, Congressman Ryan?
###3549 REP. RYAN: We don’t want to stay. We want -- look, one of my best friends in Janesville,
###3554 a reservist, is at a forward operating base in Eastern Afghanistan right now. Our wives
###3559 are best friends, our daughters are best friends. I want -- I want him and all of our troops
###3565 to come home as soon and safely as possible.
###3569 We want to make sure that 2014 is successful. That’s why we want to make sure that we
###3573 give our commanders what they say they need to make it successful. We don’t want to
###3577 extend beyond 2014. That’s the point we’re making.
###3579 You know, if it was just this, I feel like we would -- we would be able to call this
###3586 a success, but it’s not. What we are witnessing as we turn on our television screens these
###3592 days, is the absolute unraveling of the Obama foreign policy. Problems are growing at home,
###3598 but jobs -- problems are growing abroad, but jobs aren’t growing here at home.
###3602 MS. RADDATZ: Let me go back to this. He says we’re absolutely leaving in 2014. You’re
###3609 saying that’s not an absolute, but you won’t talk about what conditions would justify --
###3613 REP. RYAN: Do you know why we say that? Do you know why we say that?
###3614 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I’d like to know why.
###3615 REP. RYAN: Because we don’t want to broadcast to our enemies, put a date on your calendar,
###3619 wait us out and then come back.
###3620 We want to make sure --
###3621 MS. RADDATZ: But you agree with the timeline?
###3622 REP. RYAN: We do -- we do agree with the timeline in the transition, but what we -- what any
###3628 administration will do in 2013 is assess the situation to see how best to complete this
###3634 timeline. What we do not want to do --
###3636 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: We will leave in 2014.
###3637 REP. RYAN: What we do not want to do is give our allies reason to trust us less and our
###3643 enemies more -- we don’t want to embolden our enemies to hold and wait out for us and
###3649 then take over the --
###3650 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Martha, that’s a bizarre statement.
###3650 REP. RYAN: That’s why we want to make sure -- no, that’s why we want to make sure that
###3653 this -- that --
###3653 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s a bizarre statement, since 49 of our allies -- hear me, 49 of our
###3657 allies signed onto this position, 49.
###3660 REP. RYAN: And we’re reading that they want to pull out early.
###3662 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Forty-nine. Forty-nine of our allies said out in 2014. It’s the
###3667 responsibility of the Afghans. We have other responsibilities --
###3672 REP. RYAN: Which is -- which is -- which is what we agree with.
###3672 MS. RADDATZ: Do you -- do you think that this timeline -- but we have -- we have soldiers
###3675 and Marines --
###3676 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Theirs are sufficient. ?)
###3676 MS. RADDATZ: We have Afghan forces murdering our forces over there. The Taliban is, do
###3682 you think, taking advantage of this timeline?
###3684 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, look, the Taliban -- what we’ve found out -- and we -- you
###3689 -- you saw it in Iraq, Martha. Unless you set a timeline, Baghdad in the case of Iraq
###3696 and -- and Kabul in the case of Afghanistan will not step up. They’re happy to let us
###3702 continue to do the job -- international security forces to do the job. The only way they step
###3707 up is say, fellas, we’re leaving; we’ve trained you; step up. Step up.
###3714 MS. RADDATZ: But let me -- let me go back --
###3715 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s the only way it works.
###3716 MS. RADDATZ: Let me go back to the surge troops that we put in there. And you brought this
###3721 up, Congressman Ryan. I have talked to a lot of troops. I’ve talked to senior officers
###3726 who were concerned that the surge troops were pulled out during the fighting season, and
###3732 some of them saw that as a political -- as a political move. So can you tell me, Vice
###3737 President Biden, what was the military reason for bringing those surge troops home before
###3742 the fighting season ended?
###3743 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The military reason was bringing -- by the way, when the president
###3745 announced the surge -- you’ll remember, Martha -- he said, the surge will be out by
###3751 the end of the summer. The military said, the surge will be out. Nothing political about
###3757 this. Before the surge occurred -- so you be a little straight with me here, too -- before
###3762 the surge occurred, we said, they’ll be out by the end of the summer. That’s what
###3767 the military said. The reason for that is --
###3769 MS. RADDATZ: Military follows orders. They -- I mean, there -- trust me, there are people
###3773 --
###3773 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Sure --
###3773 MS. RADDATZ: -- who were concerned about pulling out on the fighting season.
###3775 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: But -- there are people that were concerned, but not the Joint Chiefs.
###3779 That was their recommendation in the Oval Office to the president of the United States
###3784 of America. I sat there. I’m sure you’ll find someone who disagrees with the Pentagon.
###3788 I’m positive you’ll find that within the military. But that’s not the case here.
###3793 And secondly, the reason why the military said that is you cannot wait and have a cliff.
###3800 It takes, you know, months and months and months to draw down forces. (Inaudible) -- cannot
###3806 wait --
###3807 REP. RYAN: Let me bring some -- let me try and illustrate the issue here, because I think
###3810 this -- it can get a little confusing. We’ve all met with General Allen and General Scaparotti
###3814 in Afghanistan to talk about fighting seasons. Here’s the way it works. The mountain passes
###3819 fill in with snow. The Taliban and the terrorists and the Haqqani and the Quetta shura come
###3825 over from Pakistan to fight our men and women. When it fills in with snow, they can’t do
###3829 it. That’s what we call fighting seasons. In the warm months fighting gets really high;
###3834 in the winter it goes down.
###3836 And so when Admiral Mullen and General Petraeus came to Congress and said, if you pull these
###3842 people out before the fighting season is end, it puts people more at risk -- that’s the
###3847 problem. Yes, we drew 22,000 troops down last month. But the remaining troops that are there,
###3853 who still have the same mission to prosecute, counterinsurgency, are doing it with fewer
###3858 people.
###3860 That makes them less safe.
###3861 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Inaudible.)
###3861 REP. RYAN: We’re sending fewer people out in all these hot spots to do the same job
###3867 that they were supposed to do a month ago --
###3868 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Because we turned it over --
###3869 REP. RYAN: -- but we took 22,000 people out for them to do it.
###3872 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: -- we turned it over to the Afghan troops we trained. No one got
###3876 pulled out that didn’t get filled in by trained Afghan personnel. And he’s -- he’s
###3882 -- he’s conflating two issues. The fighting season that Petraeus was talking about and
###3889 former -- and Admiral Mullen was the fighting season this spring. That’s what he was talking
###3894 about. We did not -- we did not pull them out.
###3897 REP. RYAN: The calendar works the same every year. (Chuckles.)
###3899 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: It does work the same every year. (Inaudible) -- there --
###3902 REP. RYAN: (Chuckles.) Spring, summer, fall -- (chuckles) -- it’s warm or it’s not.
###3906 They’re still fighting us, they’re still coming over the passes, they’ll -- they’re
###3910 still coming in to Zabul or to Kunar, to all of these areas, but we are sending fewer people
###3916 to the front to fight them. And that is not safe.
###3917 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s right, because that’s the Afghan responsibility. We’ve
###3921 trained them.
###3921 REP. RYAN: Not in the East.
###3922 MS. RADDATZ: Let’s move -- let’s move to another war.
###3924 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Not in the East? (Inaudible) --
###3926 REP. RYAN: (Inaudible) -- East, RC-East --
###3926 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: RC-East, most dangerous place in the world.
###3929 REP. RYAN: That’s why -- that’s why we don’t want to send fewer people to do the
###3930 job.
###3930 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That’s -- that’s why we should send Americans in to do the
###3932 job instead of the -- you’d rather Americans be going in and doing the job instead of -- (inaudible)
###3936 --
###3936 REP. RYAN: No. We are already sending Americans to do the job --
###3938 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: No --
###3938 REP. RYAN: -- but fewer of them. That’s the whole point.
###3939 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: That -- that’s right. We’re sending in more Afghans to do the
###3942 job, Afghans to do the job.
###3945 MS. RADDATZ: Let’s move to another war, the civil war in Syria, where there are estimates
###3950 that -- estimates that more than 25,000, 30,000 people have now been killed. In March of last
###3956 year, President Obama explained the military action taken in Libya by saying it was in
###3962 the national interest to go in and prevent further massacres from occurring there. So
###3968 why doesn’t the same logic apply in Syria? Vice President Biden.
###3973 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: It’s a different country. It’s a different country. It is five times
###3976 as large geographically. It has one-fifth the population that is Libya, one-fifth the
###3982 population, five times as large geographically.
###3984 It’s in a part of the world where you’re not going to see whatever would come from
###3989 that war. It’s (seep ?) into a regional war. You’re in a country that is heavily
###3995 populated in the midst of the most dangerous area in the world. And in fact, if, in fact,
###4001 it blows up and the wrong people gain control, it’s going to have impact on the entire
###4007 region, causing potentially regional wars.
###4009 We are working hand in glove with the Turks, with the Jordanians, with the Saudis and with
###4015 all the people in the region attempting to identify the people who deserve the help so
###4021 that when Assad goes and he will go, there will be a legitimate government that follows
###4027 on, not an al-Qaida-sponsored government that follows on.
###4030 And all this loose talk of my friend, Governor Romney, and the congressman about how we’re
###4036 going to do, we could do so much more in there, what more would they do other than put American
###4042 boots on the ground? The last thing America needs is to get into another ground war in
###4048 the Middle East requiring tens of thousands if not well over a hundred thousand American
###4054 forces. That -- they are the facts. They are the facts.
###4058 Now, every time the governor is asked about this, he doesn’t say any -- he say -- he
###4064 goes up with a whole lot of verbiage, but when he gets pressed, he says, no, he would
###4069 not do anything different then we are doing now. Are they proposing putting American troops
###4074 on the ground, putting American aircraft in their airspace? Is that what they’re proposing?
###4079 If they do, they should speak up and say so. But that’s not what they’re saying.
###4084 We are doing it exactly like we need to do to identify those forces who, in fact, will
###4092 provide for a stable government and not cause a regional Sunni-Shia war when Bassad (ph)
###4099 -- when Bashir (sic; Bashar) Assad falls.
###4100 MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.
###4102 REP. RYAN: Nobody is proposing to send troops to Syria -- American troops.
###4107 Now let me say it this way. How would we do things differently? We wouldn’t refer Bashar
###4112 Assad as a reformer when he’s killing his own civilians with his Russian-provided weapons.
###4119 We wouldn’t be outsourcing our foreign policy to the United Nations, giving Vladimir Putin
###4125 veto power over our efforts to try and deal with this issue. He’s vetoed three of them.
###4130 Hillary Clinton went to Russia to try and convince him not to do so; they thwarted her
###4135 efforts. She said they were on the wrong side of history. She was right about that. This
###4138 is just one more example of how the Russia reset’s not working.
###4142 And so where are we? After international pressure mounted, then President Obama said Bashar
###4146 Assad should go. It’s been over a year. The man has slaughtered tens of thousands
###4152 of his own people and more foreign fighters are spilling into this country. So the longer
###4157 this has gone on, the more people -- groups like al-Qaida are going in. We could have
###4164 more easily identified the Free Syrian Army, the freedom fighters, working with our allies,
###4170 the Turks, the Qataris, the Saudis, had we had a better plan in place to begin with,
###4176 working through our allies. But no, we waited for Kofi Annan to try and come up with an
###4181 agreement through the U.N. That bought Bashar Assad time. We gave Russia veto power over
###4187 our efforts through the U.N. and meanwhile about 30,000 Syrians are dead.
###4192 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: What would my friend do differently? If you notice, he never answers
###4198 the question.
###4198 REP. RYAN: No, I would -- I -- we would not be going through the U.N. on all of these
###4201 things --
###4201 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Let -- let -- let me -- you don’t go through the U.N. We are
###4204 in the process now and have been for months in making sure that help, humanitarian aid,
###4211 as well as other aid and training, is getting to those forces that we believe, the Turks
###4218 believe, the Jordanians believe, the Saudis believe are the free forces inside of Syria.
###4225 That is under way. Our allies were all on the same page, NATO as well as our Arab allies,
###4232 in terms of trying to get a settlement. That was their idea. We’re the ones that said,
###4238 enough.
###4239 With regard to the reset not working, the fact of the matter is that Russia has a different
###4244 interest in Syria than we do, and that’s not in our interest.
###4247 MS. RADDATZ: What happens if Assad does not fall? Congressman Ryan, what happens to the
###4253 region? What happens if he hangs on? What happens if he does?
###4256 REP. RYAN: Then Iran keeps their greatest ally in the region. He’s a sponsor of terrorism.
###4261 He’ll probably continue slaughtering his people. We and the world community will lose
###4265 our credibility on this. Look, he mentioned the reset.
###4268 MS. RADDATZ: So what would Romney-Ryan do about that credibility?
###4270 REP. RYAN: Well, we agree with the same red line, actually, they do on chemical weapons,
###4275 but not putting American troops in, other than to secure those chemical weapons. They’re
###4279 right about that. But what we should have done earlier is work with those freedom fighters,
###4286 those dissidents in Syria. We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer, and we should
###4292 not have -- we should not have waited to Russia to give us the green light --
###4294 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: We didn’t call Assad --
###4294 MS. RADDATZ: What’s your criteria for --
###4294 REP. RYAN: We should not have waited for Russia to give us the green light at the U.N. to
###4299 do something about it.
###4300 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Russia --
###4300 REP. RYAN: They’re -- they’re still arming the man. Iran is flying flights over Iraq
###4305 --
###4305 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: And the opposition is being armed --
###4307 REP. RYAN: -- to help -- to help -- to help Bashar Assad. And by the way, if we had the
###4311 status of forces agreement that the vice president said he would bet his vice presidency on in
###4315 Iraq, we probably would have been able to prevent that. But he failed to achieve that
###4319 as well. Again --
###4320 MS. RADDATZ: Let me ask you quickly, what’s your criteria for intervention?
###4322 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I don’t -- yeah.
###4323 REP. RYAN: In Syria?
###4324 MS. RADDATZ: Worldwide.
###4325 REP. RYAN: What is in the national interests of the American people.
###4328 MS. RADDATZ: How about humanitarian interests?
###4328 REP. RYAN: What is in the national security of the American people -- it’s got to be
###4332 in the strategic national interests of our country.
###4334 MS. RADDATZ: No humanitarian?
###4336 REP. RYAN: Each situation will -- will come up with its own set of circumstances. But
###4341 putting American troops on the ground, that’s got to be within the national security interests
###4346 of the American people.
###4347 MS. RADDATZ: I want to -- we’re almost out of time here.
###4349 REP. RYAN: That means things like embargoes and sanctions and overflights -- those are
###4353 things that don’t put American troops on the ground. But if you’re talking about
###4356 putting American troops on the ground, only in our national security interests.
###4360 MS. RADDATZ: I want to move on, and I want to return home for these last few questions.
###4365 This debate is indeed historic. We have two Catholic candidates, first time on a stage
###4372 such as this, and I would like to ask you both to tell me what role your religion has
###4378 played in your own personal views on abortion. Please talk about how you came to that decision.
###4387 Talk about how your religion played a part in that. And please, this is such an emotional
###4393 issue for so many --
###4394 REP. RYAN: Sure.
###4395 MS. RADDATZ: -- people in this country. Please talk personally about this if you could. Congressman
###4400 Ryan.
###4402 REP. RYAN: I don’t see how a person can separate their public life from their private
###4407 life or from their faith. Our faith informs us in everything we do. My faith informs me
###4413 about how to take care of the vulnerable, about how to make sure that people have a
###4418 chance in life.
###4420 Now, you want to ask basically why I’m pro-life? It’s not simply because of my Catholic faith.
###4427 That’s a factor, of course, but it’s also because of reason and science. You know, I
###4433 think about 10 1/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville
###4440 where I was born for our seven-week ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat.
###4448 Our little baby was in the shape of a bean, and to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn
###4456 child, Liza, “Bean.” (Chuckles.)
###4458 Now, I believe that life begins at conception.
###4462 That’s why -- those are the reasons why I’m pro-life.
###4465 Now, I understand this is a difficult issue. And I respect people who don’t agree with
###4470 me on this. But the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortion with the exceptions
###4478 for rape, incest and life of the mother.
###4481 What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues. Look at what
###4488 they’re doing through “Obamacare” with respect to assaulting the religious liberties
###4492 of this country. They’re infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion,
###4500 by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals. Our church should
###4504 not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious -- religious liberties.
###4508 And with respect to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they want it to be safe,
###4513 legal and rare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding, taxpayer
###4519 funding in “Obamacare,” taxpayer funding with foreign aid. The vice president himself
###4523 went to China and said that he sympathized or wouldn’t second- guess their one-child
###4529 policy of forced abortions and sterilizations. That, to me, is pretty extreme.
###4534 MS. RADDATZ: Vice President Biden.
###4536 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: My religion defines who I am. And I’ve been a practicing Catholic
###4544 my whole life. And it has particularly informed my social doctrine. Catholic social doctrine
###4552 talks about taking care of those who -- who can’t take care of themselves, people who
###4558 need help.
###4560 With regard to -- with regard to abortion, I accept my church’s position on abortion
###4568 as a -- what we call de fide (doctrine ?). Life begins at conception. That’s the church’s
###4574 judgment. I accept it in my personal life.
###4576 But I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews and -- I just
###4583 refuse to impose that on others, unlike my friend here, the congressman.
###4588 I -- I do not believe that -- that we have a right to tell other people that women, they
###4596 -- they can’t control their body. It’s a decision between them and their doctor,
###4600 in my view. And the Supreme Court -- I’m not going to interfere with that.
###4605 With regard to the assault on the Catholic Church, let me make it absolutely clear. No
###4611 religious institution, Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown
###4617 Hospital, Mercy -- any hospital -- none has to either refer contraception. None has to
###4624 pay for contraception. None has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy
###4631 they provide. That is a fact. That is a fact.
###4635 Now, with regard to the way in which the -- we differ, my friend says that he -- well, I
###4646 guess he accepts Governor Romney’s position now, because in the past he has argued that
###4652 there was -- there’s rape and forcible rape. He’s argued that, in the case of rape or
###4656 incest, it was still -- it would be a crime to engage in having an abortion. I just fundamentally
###4663 disagree with my friend.
###4664 MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.
###4665 REP. RYAN: All I’m saying is if you believe that life begins at conception, that therefore
###4671 doesn’t change the definition of life. That’s a principle. The policy of a Romney administration
###4677 is to oppose abortion with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. Now,
###4683 I’ve got to take issue with the Catholic Church and religious liberty.
###4687 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: You have, on the issue of Catholic social doctrine, taken issue.
###4687 REP. RYAN: If they -- if they agree with you, then why would they keep -- why would they
###4691 keep suing you? It’s a distinction without a difference.
###4693 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Chuckles.)
###4694 MS. RADDATZ: I want to go back to the abortion question here. If the Romney-Ryan ticket is
###4699 elected, should those who believe that abortion should remain legal be worried?
###4704 REP. RYAN: We don’t think that unelected judges should make this decision; that people,
###4711 through their elected representatives and reaching a consensus in society through the
###4715 democratic process, should make this determination.
###4718 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The court -- the next president will get one or two Supreme Court
###4723 nominees. That’s how close Roe v. Wade is.
###4729 Just ask yourself: With Robert Bork being the chief adviser on the court for -- for
###4736 Mr. Romney, who do you think he’s likely to appoint? Do you think he’s likely to
###4740 appoint someone like Scalia or someone else on the court, far right, that would outlaw
###4748 Planned -- excuse me -- outlaw abortion? I suspect that would happen.
###4751 I guarantee you that will not happen. We picked two people. We picked people who are open-minded.
###4757 They’ve been good justices. So keep an eye on the Supreme Court --
###4761 REP. RYAN: Was there a litmus test on them?
###4762 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: There was no litmus test. We picked people who had an open mind,
###4765 did not come with an agenda.
###4767 MS. RADDATZ: I’m going to move on to this closing question because we are running out
###4771 of time.
###4772 It’s certainly known -- you’ve said it here tonight -- that the two of you respect
###4776 our troops enormously. Your son has served, and perhaps someday your children will serve
###4783 as well.
###4784 I recently spoke to a highly decorated soldier who said that this presidential campaign has
###4790 left him dismayed. He told me, quote, “The ads are so negative and they are all tearing
###4795 down each other, rather than building up the country.”
###4799 What would you say to that American hero about this campaign? And at the end of the day,
###4804 are you ever embarrassed by the tone?
###4809 Vice President Biden.
###4810 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I would say to him the same thing I say to my son, who did serve
###4815 year in Iraq: that we only have one truly sacred obligation as a government. That’s
###4823 to equip those we send into harm’s way and care for those who come home.
###4827 That’s the only sacred obligation we have. Everything else falls behind that.
###4833 I would also tell him that the fact that he, this decorated soldier you talked about, fought
###4843 for his country -- that that should be honored. He should not be thrown into a category of
###4849 the 47 percent who don’t pay their taxes while he was out there fighting and not having
###4854 to pay taxes and somehow not taking responsibility.
###4858 I would also tell him that there are things that have occurred in this campaign and occur
###4863 in every campaign that I’m sure both of us regret anyone having said, particularly
###4868 in these special new groups that can go out there, raise all the money they want, not
###4874 have to identify themselves and say the most scurrilous things about the other candidate.
###4879 It’s -- it’s -- it’s an abomination.
###4881 But the bottom line here is I’d ask that hero you reference to take a look at whether
###4887 or not Governor Romney or President Obama has the conviction to help lift up the middle
###4895 class, restore them to where they were before this Great Recession hit and they got wiped
###4900 out or whether or not he’s going to continue to focus on taking care of only the very wealthy,
###4906 not asking them to make -- pay any part of the deal to bring the -- bring back the middle
###4911 class, the economy of this country.
###4912 I would ask him to take a look at whether the president of the United States has acted
###4918 wisely in the use of force and whether or not the slipshod comments being made by my
###4923 -- my friend or by Governor Romney serve -- serve our interests very well. But there are things
###4931 that have been said in campaigns that I -- I find not very appealing.
###4936 MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.
###4937 REP. RYAN: First of all, I’d thank him to his service to our country.
###4940 Second of all, I’d say, we are not going to impose these devastating cuts on our military
###4944 which compromises their mission and their safety.
###4947 And then I would say, you have a president who ran for president four years ago promising
###4953 hope and change who has now turned his campaign into attack, blame and defame. You see, if
###4960 you don’t have a good record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone to
###4965 run from. That was what President Obama said in 2008. It’s what he’s doing right now.
###4972 Look at all the string of broken promises. If you like your health care plan you can
###4975 keep it -- try telling that to the 20 million people who are projected to lose their health
###4980 insurance if “Obamacare” goes through or the seven point million -- 7.4 million
###4984 seniors who are going to lose it.
###4985 Or remember when he said this: I guarantee if you make less than $250,000, your taxes
###4991 won’t go up. Of the 21 tax increases in “Obamacare,” 12 of them hit the middle
###4995 class.
###4996 Or remember when he said, health insurance premiums will go down, and $2,500 per family
###5000 per year? They’ve gone up 3,000 (dollars), and they’re expected to go up another 2,400
###5004 (dollars).
###5005 Or remember when he said, I promise by the end of my first term, I’ll cut the deficit
###5009 in half in four years? We’ve had four budgets, four trillion-dollar deficits. A debt crisis
###5017 is coming. We can’t keep spending and borrowing like this. We can’t just keep spending money
###5022 we don’t have.
###5024 Leaders run to problems to fix problems. President Obama has not even put a credible plan on
###5030 the table in any -- any of his four years to deal with this debt crisis. I passed two
###5035 budgets to deal with this. Mitt Romney’s put ideas on the table. We’ve got to tackle
###5039 this debt crisis before it tackles us.
###5041 The president likes to say he has a plan. He gave a speech. We asked his budget office,
###5046 can we see the plan? They sent us to this press secretary. He gave us a copy of the
###5050 speech. We asked the Congressional Budget Office, tell us what President Obama’s plan
###5053 is to prevent a debt crisis. They said, it’s a speech; we can’t estimate speeches. You
###5057 see? That’s what we get in this administration: speeches. But we’re not getting leadership.
###5063 Mitt Romney is uniquely qualified to fix these problems. His lifetime of experience, his
###5070 proven track record of bipartisanship -- and what do we have from the president? He broke
###5074 his big promise to bring people together to solve the country’s biggest problems. And
###5078 what I would tell him is we don’t have to settle for this.
###5080 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Inaudible.)
###5080 MS. RADDATZ: I -- I --
###5081 REP. RYAN: We can do better than this.
###5082 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: I hope I’ll get equal time.
###5083 MS. RADDATZ: I -- you will get just a few minutes here, a few seconds, really.
###5088 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: The two budgets the congressman introduced have eviscerated all
###5093 the things that the middle class cares about. It has knocked 19 -- it will knock 19 million
###5098 people off of Medicare. It will kick 200,000 children off of early education. It will eliminate
###5105 the tax credit people have to be able to send their children to college. It cuts education
###5110 by $450 billion. It -- it -- it does -- it does virtually nothing, except continue to
###5118 increase the tax cuts for the very wealthy.
###5120 And, you know, we’ve had enough of this. My -- the idea that these -- so concerned
###5126 about these deficits, I pointed out, he voted to put two wars on a credit card. He did --
###5130 MS. RADDATZ: We’re -- we’re going to --
###5131 REP. RYAN: He voted --
###5132 MS. RADDATZ: We’re going to the closing statements in a minute.
###5133 REP. RYAN: But let me -- just a second --
###5133 MS. RADDATZ: I -- you’re going to have your closing --
###5135 REP. RYAN: Not raising taxes is not cutting taxes. And by the way, our budget --
###5138 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: We have not raised --
###5139 REP. RYAN: -- we increased spending by 3 percent a year instead of 4 1/2 percent like they
###5143 proposed.
###5143 MS. RADDATZ: Let me -- let me calm down things here --
###5145 REP. RYAN: So not spending more money as much as they say is not a spending cut.
###5146 MS. RADDATZ: -- just for a minute. And I want to talk to you very briefly before we go to
###5150 closing statements about your own personal character. If you are elected, what could
###5155 you both give to this country as a man, as a human being that no one else could?
###5161 REP. RYAN: Honesty. No one else could? There are plenty of fine people who could lead this
###5166 country. But what you need are people who, when they say they’re going to do something,
###5171 they go do it. What you need are when people see problems, they offer solutions to fix
###5177 those problems. We’re not getting that.
###5180 Look, we can grow this economy faster. That’s what our five-point plan for a stronger middle
###5184 class is all about. It’s about getting 12 million jobs, higher take-home pay; getting
###5187 people out of poverty, into the middle class. That means going with proven pro-growth policies
###5192 that we know work to get people back to work, putting ideas on the table, working with Democrats
###5198 -- that actually works sometimes -- and then getting things done.
###5200 MS. RADDATZ: Vice President, could we get to that -- to that issue of what you could
###5203 bring as a man, a human being? And I really am going to keep you to about 15 seconds here.
###5207 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, he gets 40, I get 15, but that’s OK. That’s all right.
###5209 MS. RADDATZ: He didn’t have 40. He didn’t have 40.
###5211 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Now, let me tell you, I -- my -- my record stands for itself. I
###5216 never say anything I don’t mean. Everybody knows whatever I say, I do. And my whole life
###5223 has been devoted to leveling the playing field for middle-class people, giving them an even
###5227 break, treating Main Street and Wall Street the same, holding the same responsibility.
###5231 Look at my record. It’s been all about the middle class. They’re the people who grow
###5236 this country. We think you grow this country from the middle out, not from the top down.
###5241 MS. RADDATZ: OK. We now turn to the candidates for their closing statements. Thank you, gentlemen.
###5245 And that coin toss, again, has Vice President Biden starting with a closing statement.
###5250 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, let -- let -- let me say at the outset that I want to thank
###5254 you, Martha, for doing this, and Centre College. The fact is that we’re in a situation where
###5262 we inherited a god-awful circumstance. People are in real trouble. We acted to move to bring
###5270 relief to the people who need the most help now.
###5273 And -- and in the process, we -- in case you haven’t noticed, we have strong disagreements.
###5278 But I -- you probably detected my frustration with their attitude about the -- the American
###5285 people. My friend says that 30 percent of the American people are takers. They -- Romney
###5291 points out, 47 percent of the people won’t take responsibility. He’s talking about
###5295 my mother and father. And he’s talking about the places I grew up in, my neighbors in Scranton
###5300 and Claymont.
###5301 He’s talking about -- he’s talking about the people that have built this country. All
###5305 they’re looking for, Martha -- all they’re looking for is an even shot. When they’ve
###5309 been given the shot, they’ve done it. They’ve done it. Whenever you level the playing field,
###5314 they’ve been able to move.
###5314 And they want a little bit of peace of mind. And the president and I are not going to rest
###5319 until that playing field is leveled, they in fact have a clear shot and they have peace
###5325 of mind, until they can turn to their kid and say with a degree of confidence, honey,
###5329 it’s going to be OK. It’s going to be OK. That’s what this is all about.
###5335 MS. RADDATZ: Congressman Ryan.
###5337 REP. RYAN: I want to thank you as well, Martha, Danville, Kentucky, Centre College.
###5342 And I want to thank you, Joe. It’s been an honor to engage in this critical debate.
###5347 We face a very big choice. What kind of country are we going to be? What kind of country are
###5355 we going to give our kids? President Obama -- he had his chance. He made his choices.
###5361 His economic agenda, more spending, more borrowing, higher taxes, a government takeover of health
###5366 care -- it’s not working. It’s failed to create the jobs we need. Twenty-three million
###5373 Americans are struggling for work today. Fifteen percent of Americans are in poverty.
###5379 This is not what a real recovery looks like. You deserve better. Mitt Romney and I want
###5385 to earn your support. We’re offering real reforms for a real recovery for every American.
###5393 Mitt Romney, his experience, his ideas, his solutions, is uniquely qualified to get this
###5401 job done. At a time when we have a jobs crisis in America, wouldn’t it be nice to have
###5405 a job creator in the White House?
###5407 The choice is clear: a stagnant economy that promotes more government dependency, or a
###5415 dynamic, growing economy that promotes opportunity and jobs. Mitt Romney and I will not duck
###5420 the tough issues.
###5423 We will take responsibility. And we will not try to replace our founding principles; we
###5432 will reapply our founding principles. The choice is clear, and the choice rests with
###5438 you, and we ask you for your vote. Thank you.
###5441 MS. RADDATZ: And thank you both again. Thank you very much.
###5444 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you.
###5445 MS. RADDATZ: This concludes the vice presidential debate. Please tune in next Tuesday for the
###5449 second presidential debate at Hofstra University in New York.
###5453 I’m Martha Raddatz of ABC News. I do hope all of you go to the polls. Have a good evening.
###5459 (Applause.)
###5459 END
