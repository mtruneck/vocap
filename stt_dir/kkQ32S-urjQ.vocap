###17 SUROOSH ALVI: The next morning, we joined the police
###19 on a raid of Orangi Town, an area reported to be a popular
###22 hideout for the Taliban.
###25 As Americans have escalated drone attacks in the tribal
###27 areas, the Taliban have increasingly
###29 moved to the cities.
###31 And Karachi, with its huge Afghan refugee population, is
###35 the perfect place to blend in.
###36 CHAUDRY ASLAM: [SPEAKING URDU]
###38 
###62 SUROOSH ALVI: Now, I'll admit that I don't know a lot about
###63 police tactics, but I couldn't help but notice that this
###66 operation lacked the element of surprise.
###68 You've got hundreds of police officers with sirens blaring,
###71 and again, every television crew in town.
###74 None of the cops seemed too worried about walking into a
###75 potential showdown with some of America's most wanted.
###80 It wasn't quite the crack team we were expecting to be
###82 conducting this kind of operation.
###84 
###91 Deputy Tariq Malik was designated as our official
###94 tour guide for the operation.
###96 TARIQ MALIK: [SPEAKING URDU]
###98 
###114 SUROOSH ALVI: So I feel like I'm on the set of a cop movie
###115 right now, the kind of buffoon cops that nobody
###118 wants to work with.
###119 They get the shitty assignment.
###121 So we headed it into the back alleys of Orangi Town to find
###124 some Taliban, Sunni extremists, or any other kind
###127 of bad guy that was still dumb enough to be there after 300
###130 members of Karachi's finest came rolling through.
###133 So this is predominantly an Afghani and Mehsud tribe
###138 neighborhood.
###139 Here is a 4.5 million person slum that you can't control.
###144 So when the Taliban want to hide-- when things are going
###146 too hot in the tribal areas- they'll come to a place like
###148 this and blend right in and no one knows they're here.
###152 Jihadis--
###153 that's what they're hunting for--
###154 the new gang in town.
###155 
###158 Our friend, Deputy Malik, seemed more interested in
###160 texting than catching Taliban.
###163 Do you think anyone will shoot at us?
###165 TARIQ MALIK: Eh?
###165 SUROOSH ALVI: Will anyone shoot at us?
###166 TARIQ MALIK: Yeah.
###167 SUROOSH ALVI: Will they shoot?
###167 TARIQ MALIK: Yeah.
###168 [INAUDIBLE].
###168 SUROOSH ALVI: OK.
###171 SUROOSH ALVI: We'll fight back.
###171 OK.
###172 You'll protect Jason?
###173 TARIQ MALIK: Yeah, yeah,
###173 SUROOSH ALVI: OK, good.
###174 I'm responsible for him.
###176 TARIQ MALIK: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].
###178 We are responsible.
###180 SUROOSH ALVI: The cops stopped and searched the first vaguely
###182 religious looking guy they saw, only to come up empty.
###185 So we continued on.
###186 
###193 We're going house by house now.
###196 MALE SPEAKER: This guy in the white has his
###197 finger on the trigger.
###198 SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah, I know.
###198 I know.
###199 He actually seems serious about this whole thing, which
###201 makes me think that they might actually pull some criminals
###204 out of this.
###206 They can't not with all this weeding.
###208 
###210 But then I started thinking, what if we do run into some
###213 hardcore Taliban and shit hits the fan?
###216 How am I going to explain this to Jason's mom?
###218 I'm sorry, Mrs. Movica, but your son, he was shot while
###222 embedded with the Karachi police force.
###225 He was hunting down Sunni extremists.
###229 Just another day at the office.
###232 I was beginning to figure out Deputy
###233 Malik's policing strategy--
###235 no camera left behind.
###237 
###239 SUROOSH ALVI: I mean, this is a pure show.
###241 This is pure media cop show for all the networks tonight.
###247 When I go on these shoots, I don't want to end up
###250 surrounded by guns, it just happens.
###252 Why are there so many dudes with guns in
###254 everything we film?
###256 How do you know when you find the Taliban?
###258 
###265 SUROOSH ALVI: Right.
###266 And what are you looking for right now?
###267 Those specific Taliban members?
###270 
###274 SUROOSH ALVI: Killers.
###275 You're looking for the killers.
###277 SUROOSH ALVI: And then what are you going
###277 to do with the killers?
###280 SUROOSH ALVI: When you find them, you're
###280 going to arrest them?
###282 
###285 SUROOSH ALVI: Of the kidnappers.
###286 
###290 We continued waltzing through Orangi Town, looking for
###293 "killer type peoples." And then they found him--
###297 straight out of Central Casting, a proper suspected
###300 Taliban member, turban and all.
###302 
###305 SUROOSH ALVI: Deputy Malik was like a proud papa.
###307 
###310 TARIQ MALIK: [SPEAKING URDU]
###311 
###319 SUROOSH ALVI: The media were happy, so the cops were happy,
###321 and they called it a day with one nine millimeter pistol and
###324 a guy in a turban safely off the streets.
###326 
###331 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING URDU]
###333 
###335 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING URDU]
###338 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING URDU]
###339 
###342 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING URDU]
###345 SUROOSH ALVI: Some guns that they confiscated from the old
###347 guy that looked like he might have been in the Taliban.
###349 I highly doubt he was in the Taliban.
###351 MALE SPEAKER: Did you see how that happened?
###352 SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah.
###353 He was smiling.
###353 He was smiling a bit.
###355 MALE SPEAKER: That was all set up?
###357 SUROOSH ALVI: Yep.
###358 
###360 MALE SPEAKER: All the kind of mocking of the situation
###363 aside, this is a really dangerous neighborhood.
###366 
###368 SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah, exactly.
###370 Watching what was supposed to be a sensitive anti-terrorist
###372 operation get turned into a media circus, I couldn't help
###375 but think that it was no wonder the US didn't want to
###378 involve the Pakistanis in the raid on Bin Laden's compound.
###381 It would have been broadcast on live television, and Bin
###384 Laden would have vanished into thin air, kind of like any
###387 actual Taliban that may have been in Orangi Town.
###389 
###394 Ugh.
###396 The gangsters, when they kidnap people, this is where
###398 they come and keep them, because no one would come out
###402 here to look for them, because--
###404 I mean, why would they?
###405 It's brutal.
###406 
###409 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING URDU]
