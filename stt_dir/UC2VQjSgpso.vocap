###16 ANJEM: We are here maybe saying to you, look, there's a
###18 better way of life.
###19 You don't need to live like animals
###21 following your own desires.
###22 The big industries you see nowadays in the West are
###25 things like gambling, pornography, alcohol, drugs,
###28 homosexuality.
###29 REPORTER: If you took over Britain, you'd ban alcohol?
###32 ANJEM: Of course.
###32 Alcohol would be banned.
###33 Drugs would be banned.
###34 Pornography would be banned.
###35 Gambling would be banned.
###36 But the money saved--
###37 REPORTER: The Queen?
###37 ANJEM: There'd be no monarchy.
###38 [CHANTING IN ARABIC]
###67 ANJEM: Yeah, we're basically, we were inundated with threats
###70 of violence, with threats to kill and murder.
###74 We had hundreds of them in the two weeks when we were
###75 advertising the--
###78 on the text, via email, on blogs.
###81 Basically, the reality that I envisage was that Piccadilly
###85 Circus, which is a place of rallying, would have been
###87 occupied, and the people were planning to attack us in
###89 Trafalgar Square.
###90 Now, I have with me women, children, elderly.
###92 Therefore I had no option but to relocate.
###94 
###97 DAVE: I don't think any person with those views, no matter
###100 what color, race, or religion he has, has the right to speak
###104 on the street.
###104 If I came out with half of what he said about beheading
###108 people, et cetera, et cetera, I would be arrested for
###112 incitement.
###113 
###152 ABU: First of all, I believe that the British people, they
###156 are very ignorant about the fact what is happening abroad,
###158 even about Sheikh Osama.
###160 If they came to actually verify with us, rather than
###162 show an ugly face and be angry with us, they'd find that
###164 Islam is truly something they'd like.
###166 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###167 
###171 MAN 1: These are extreme Muslims.
###173 MAN 2: No, he's a Muslim.
###173 ANJEM: No, he's a pure Muslim.
###175 He adheres to the Islamic text completely.
###179 What does he do that is wrong in your eyes?
###181 ABU: I've spoken to many of my colleagues,
###183 for instance at work.
###184 One instance was about the Shariah.
###186 Where they were saying that, how barbaric chopping the
###189 hands of the thief was.
###191 And two weeks later, his laptop was actually stolen.
###193 And he [INAUDIBLE], he said, I feel like killing the man,
###195 chopping his head off.
###197 I said, for God's sake, all we said is chop the hands off.
###199 Don't go chopping the man's head off.
###202 ANJEM: Shall I take you to the training camp, where we're
###205 doing Al Qaeda training?
###207 And where we're making nuclear weapons?
###212 Maybe I'm doing that in my garden.
###213 INTERVIEWER: It's underneath the football pitch.
###214 ANJEM: It could be, it may well be, yeah.
###216 There might be a bunker underneath the [INAUDIBLE]
###218 Mosque.
###219 Maybe we need to dig it up and have a look.
###222 You don't want to believe everything that you see and
###225 read in the media.
###226 One of the problems of the media is that they'll
###227 fabricate something.
###228 And then they'll start believing it, you see?
###231 That's quite dangerous, really.
###232 You invent Frankenstein and Dracula, and then you start to
###234 become afraid of it, forgetting the fact that you
###236 invented him in the first place.
###237 [MEN ARGUING]
###245 ABU: My name is Abu Sumayyah from Stoke-on-Trent.
###247 I became Muslim about five years ago now, March 5, 2005.
###253 Basically, whatever Allah has given for us, we
###256 are going to take.
###257 If Allah tells us that we lash the person who doesn't pray
###261 his prayer, we lash the person who doesn't pray his prayer.
###264 If he tells us we stone the adulterer, we stone the
###266 adulterer, only because our Lord told us to.
###270 That's all.
###271 Whatever our Lord told us, we follow.
###275 ANJEM: [ARABIC GREETING].
###276 We're going to eat downstairs.
###278 I've brought some crew with me.
###279 You don't mind, do you?
###281 MAN 3: Have you seen this before?
###283 MAN 4: That's the American major in the army who turned
###287 on his colleagues.
###289 ANJEM: Well I don't think he went crazy.
###290 I think he woke up to his reality as a Muslim.
###293 And he realized that [INAUDIBLE], in fact, his
###296 so-called fallen comrades were going and occupying Muslim
###299 land, killing innocent men, women, and children.
###302 And it's something that he could not handle, when he
###304 realized that he has a responsibility.
###307 And he probably did what I think many other people may do
###310 within the US army and the British army, even, if they
###313 continue with their foreign policy.
###315 It is a very severe lesson for the British and the Americans
###321 in Afghanistan, that the Afghan
###323 police are killing them.
###325 And even their own comrades are killing them.
###328 So they need to pull out.
###329 They cannot possibly win.
###331 I don't feel sorry at all for the non-Muslims.
###333 Because Allah said in the Koran, he said,
###335 [SPEAKING ARABIC].
###338 He said, don't feel sorry for the non Muslims.
###340 Allah destined for them not to embrace Islam.
###341 He destined for them to die as non-Muslims.
###343 He destined for them to go to the hellfire.
###345 So why should I feel sorry for people who ended up like that?
###350 MAN 5: Is that chocolate?
###354 What, chocolate's your favorite?
###355 
###361 MAN 4: When we're eating, at the end of it, we lick the
###364 fingers, as the prophets did then.
###366 And Muslim scientists have found that these three fingers
###370 release a chemical.
###372 And when it gets to our [INAUDIBLE] system, it helps
###375 us digest the food.
###379 ANJEM: Do you feel enlightened?
###380 You're not going to look at a Muslim the same now?
###382 INTERVIEWER: In the press you come across as
###383 quite scary, guys.
###385 ANJEM: I am a quite scary guy, for people who don't believe,
###387 who believe that they can occupy our land.
###390 And they can just discriminate against
###391 Muslims, we're very scary.
###394 But for those people who believe that we can live
###395 together under divine law, we're not very
###399 scary at all, really.
###402 If you broke wind, that would be a natural bodily functions.
###405 If we did, they'd have Hans Blix down here, seeing if it's
###407 a weapon of mass destruction of some kind.
###410 [LAUGHTER]
