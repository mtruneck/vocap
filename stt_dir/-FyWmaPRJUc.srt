the nicest person we've ever

Martin Luther King Day.


16
0:0:35,9 --> 0:0:39,27
And I want to know how much
people know about Dr. King.


17
0:0:39,27 --> 0:0:41,49
So do you know what's
today's holiday?


18
0:0:41,49 --> 0:0:42,61

guy, and he worked for

SHAN HUANG: What are
you going to do?

MALE SPEAKER 1: I'm going to
go south where it's warm.


41
0:1:20,53 --> 0:1:22,81
And I think that's about it.


42
0:1:22,81 --> 0:1:23,23
Get warm.


43
0:1:23,23 --> 0:1:24,24
That's what black people like.


44
0:1:24,24 --> 0:1:24,99

SHAN HUANG: What are you
going to do today?


50
0:1:34,6 --> 0:1:37,23
MALE SPEAKER 6: Um, I might do
the same thing I did last


51
0:1:37,23 --> 0:1:41,24
year, was I read a little bit
about him when I got home.


52
0:1:41,24 --> 0:1:44,21
And like, that's mostly it.


53
0:1:44,21 --> 0:1:46,5
Just read about him
and like, yeah.


54
0:1:46,5 --> 0:1:47,67
What he did.


55
0:1:47,67 --> 0:1:49,1
SHAN HUANG: So you
read a little bit


56
0:1:49,1 --> 0:1:50,19
about him every day?


57
0:1:50,19 --> 0:1:51,33
I mean, every year?


58
0:1:51,33 --> 0:1:51,98
MALE SPEAKER 6: Mm-hmm.


59
0:1:51,98 --> 0:1:54,3
SHAN HUANG: So maybe when you're
50, you would know


60
0:1:54,3 --> 0:1:56,26
everything about him.


61
0:1:56,26 --> 0:1:58,65
What do you know
about Dr. King?


62
0:1:58,65 --> 0:2:0,79
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Um, well, he
was leader of the Black Civil


63
0:2:0,79 --> 0:2:2,61
Rights Movement here.


64
0:2:2,61 --> 0:2:4,46
MALE SPEAKER 7: The whites
didn't like him, and so he


65
0:2:4,46 --> 0:2:8,69
protested, and he had this
speech that he had a dream for


66
0:2:8,69 --> 0:2:12,6
everybody to be the
same equal rights.


67
0:2:12,6 --> 0:2:14,79
SHAN HUANG: Very,
very impressive.


68
0:2:14,79 --> 0:2:18,81
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: I had a dream
my English teacher came


69
0:2:18,81 --> 0:2:22,26
out, and he said, oh, your
English is so poor.


70
0:2:22,26 --> 0:2:24,11
You have to try more.


71
0:2:24,11 --> 0:2:27,58
MALE SPEAKER 5: I had a dream
that I was teaching kids, and


72
0:2:27,58 --> 0:2:31,17
one of them turned
into my boss.


73
0:2:31,17 --> 0:2:33,53
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: We're actually
experimenting with


74
0:2:33,53 --> 0:2:34,53
dreams at the moment.


75
0:2:34,53 --> 0:2:37,42
You have to go this forest in
your dream and then meet this


76
0:2:37,42 --> 0:2:39,49
cat there while a brass
band is playing.


77
0:2:39,49 --> 0:2:41,127
SHAN HUANG: So what about if
you're going to cook one


78
0:2:41,127 --> 0:2:45,24
dinner for Dr. King, what
would you serve him?


79
0:2:45,24 --> 0:2:46,49
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Crispy kale.


80
0:2:46,49 --> 0:2:47,68
MALE SPEAKER 3: Maybe I'd just
have a burrito, right?


81
0:2:47,68 --> 0:2:49,25
Everybody likes Mexican food.


82
0:2:49,25 --> 0:2:50,4
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Fish.


83
0:2:50,4 --> 0:2:51,81
SHAN HUANG: What type of fish?


84
0:2:51,81 --> 0:2:52,6
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Whitefish.


85
0:2:52,6 --> 0:2:54,62
And steamed potatoes.


86
0:2:54,62 --> 0:2:55,53
We call that nursery food.


87
0:2:55,53 --> 0:2:56,5
SHAN HUANG: Nursery food?


88
0:2:56,5 --> 0:2:57,36
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Yeah.


89
0:2:57,36 --> 0:2:58,59
It heals everything.


90
0:2:58,59 --> 0:3:0,78
And we'd make him miso
soup as well.


91
0:3:0,78 --> 0:3:6,29
SHAN HUANG: What do you think
that Dr. King needs to be


92
0:3:6,29 --> 0:3:7,48
healed for?


93
0:3:7,48 --> 0:3:9,7
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Needs
to be healed for?

go out and have a nice

0:3:16,2 --> 0:3:18,68
conversation with people on a
holiday here in New York, and


99
0:3:18,68 --> 0:3:21,56
you just hear about their
bullshit dreams.

101

And you may think that you don't
know who they are, but


103
0:3:27,43 --> 0:3:29,142
when you see these videos,
you're going to realize you

0:3:43,86 --> 0:3:45,23
online videos that we do.


109
0:3:45,23 --> 0:3:50,76
And those videos are a
realization of a Utopian


110
0:3:50,76 --> 0:3:54,8
vision in which we uncover
hidden songs from within the


111
0:3:54,8 --> 0:3:56,59

0:4:12,146 --> 0:4:15,44
EVAN GREGORY: Um, we started
in a musical background and


117
0:4:15,44 --> 0:4:19,18
had toured together
with my brothers.


118
0:4:19,18 --> 0:4:19,69
ANDREW GREGORY: I don't know.


119
0:4:19,69 --> 0:4:23,35
We toured a lot as a band, but
in a very small-scale way


120
0:4:23,35 --> 0:4:25,59
where we were playing to crowds
of anywhere between


121
0:4:25,59 --> 0:4:27,61
zero and 200 people.


122
0:4:27,61 --> 0:4:30,64
MICHAEL GREGORY: Nobody
likes a regular band.


123
0:4:30,64 --> 0:4:32,64
SARAH GREGORY: We were
definitely pursuing the arts


124
0:4:32,64 --> 0:4:34,4
in very traditional
ways when we first


125
0:4:34,4 --> 0:4:35,49
started working together.


126
0:4:35,49 --> 0:4:39,2
But then once your imagination
gets a little crazier and


127
0:4:39,2 --> 0:4:42,84
crazier, there's stuff that
you can only produce using


128
0:4:42,84 --> 0:4:43,88

131

132
0:4:53,3 --> 0:4:58,63
SARAH GREGORY: Back in the 2008
presidential election,


133
0:4:58,63 --> 0:5:3,46
Michael made a video out of the
first debate between Obama


134
0:5:3,46 --> 0:5:4,32
and McCain.


135
0:5:4,32 --> 0:5:6,81
And he wanted to write a song,
basically, about the issues


136
0:5:6,81 --> 0:5:7,71
that he knew that
were going to be


137
0:5:7,71 --> 0:5:9,39
coming up in that debate.


138
0:5:9,39 --> 0:5:17,66



139
0:5:17,66 --> 0:5:20,3
So he successfully made that
video and just thought it


140
0:5:20,3 --> 0:5:25,62
would be way more fun if we
could somehow get the


141
0:5:25,62 --> 0:5:28,622

along with us.

0:5:29,872 --> 0:5:33,71



144
0:5:33,71 --> 0:5:37,65
EVAN GREGORY: We took some
technology that we had a grasp


145
0:5:37,65 --> 0:5:39,79
of, pitch correction technology
that includes


146
0:5:39,79 --> 0:5:43,24
Auto-tune, and used it to modify
their voices so it


147
0:5:43,24 --> 0:5:44,26
sounds like they're
singing with us.


148
0:5:44,26 --> 0:5:47,16
And then we could create duets
and melodies that we're


149
0:5:47,16 --> 0:5:48,94
actually participating
in together.

SARAH GREGORY: We spent about
a year auto-tuning the news,


155
0:6:0,72 --> 0:6:6,21
and then realized that we
shouldn't limit our quest for

SARAH GREGORY: So then we just
started calling it Songify,


162
0:6:21,2 --> 0:6:23,0
because that's essentially what
we were doing, was just


163

very spacious.

0:6:29,62 --> 0:6:30,59
Why, you might ask?


168

Because it used to
be a horse barn.

EVAN GREGORY: This is where all
the audio magic happens,


170
0:6:34,82 --> 0:6:39,84
where we try to summon various
types of sonic wizardry to


171
0:6:39,84 --> 0:6:45,23
coax songs out of those places
in the universe that


172

skills by saying, let's

of them and--

0:7:50,89 --> 0:7:52,89
and sent one to Antoine.

So he's got one hanging
in his house, too.

EVAN GREGORY: Once the number of

then you feel like

you're beginning to hit your
stride as an auteur.

with Comedy Central, which
is really cool.

pointless to plug, since no

it right now.

just so egalitarian.

not touch your food before

No Floridian table Jenga.

That means when you get in, if
there's a four-top and a

eight of you, you
