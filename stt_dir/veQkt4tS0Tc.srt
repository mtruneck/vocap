I'm the co-producer and editor
of a short documentary called


4
0:0:11,63 --> 0:0:13,28
Mexican Pointy Boots.


5
0:0:13,28 --> 0:0:16,86
The story, it's about this
fashion trend that started in


6
0:0:16,86 --> 0:0:19,45
Matehuala, which is a town in
central Mexico, about four


7
0:0:19,45 --> 0:0:22,5
hours north of Mexico City,
where these kids started


8
0:0:22,5 --> 0:0:25,23
wearing these ridiculously long
pointy boots to dance to


9
0:0:25,23 --> 0:0:27,2
music called Tribal.


10
0:0:27,2 --> 0:0:30,88
The music and the boots became
incredibly popular.


11
0:0:30,88 --> 0:0:33,82
We also took those guys to
perform at the Vice Mexico


12
0:0:33,82 --> 0:0:38,5
anniversary party last year,
and it was pretty amazing.
