###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: I`m Carl Azuz. It is October, 31st and this is CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###5 No tricks, but we will treat you to ten minutes of commercial free headlines. It all starts
###10 right now.
###30 Catastrophic, historic, unthinkable -- those are some of the words being used to describe
###35 the impact of the storm named Sandy that hit the U.S. on Monday. Now, when that happened,
###40 when it made landfall, it wasn`t a hurricane, it was technically a post tropical storm,
###46 because its energy was coming from a different source. Whatever you want to call it, Sandy
###51 was very, very dangerous. Flooding brought on by Sandy`s wind and rain and the storm
###56 surge, the waves that were created along the coast. Some towns in New Jersey were under
###61 four or five feet of water. Floodwaters rushed into New York City subway tunnels as well.
###68 Sandy is being blamed for at least 30 deaths across the U.S. And this -- that`s a power
###75 transformer that blew in New York. Nearly 8 million people lost power because of Sandy,
###81 and some officials said it could be out for days.
###89 That kind of gives you an idea about how strong Sandy`s winds were. And so does this -- the
###95 smoke you are seeing there, the front of the building just collapsed, apparently from the
###100 wind. You might wonder how wind can be that strong. It could have something to do with
###104 where this thing hit. Tom Foreman breaks down the science.
###108 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###108 TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: As the winds of Hurricane Sandy have spread out over hundreds
###112 of miles, the estimate of how much damage they can do has also grown to $7 billion.
###118 How is that possible from wind alone? Well, we`ve sliced up Hurricane Erin (ph) here into
###123 layers to show you what -- look at the bottom down there. You see all that red -- that`s
###126 where the wind is the most intense. As you move up in the storm, it becomes less intense
###131 once you get several miles in the air, but all of the tallest buildings on the East Coast
###136 fit right down in that red zone, and in a strange way, they actually make the storm
###142 more ferocious for the people who are living there.
###144 Let me show you why. If you have an air flow passing over an empty field or perhaps low
###148 buildings, it can do so largely unimpeded. But once you introduce something like New
###153 York City to the equation here, you change everything, because now the air has to speed
###158 up to get around all those buildings and maintain its air flow to go over those buildings, and
###165 that magnifies three things that are very dangerous about hurricane winds. First of
###170 all, it makes them more explosive. In aerospace terms, whenever an airflow hit`s a square
###175 or rectangular object, it creates what`s called turbulent flow. In simple layman`s terms,
###181 that means the air becomes all roiled up and it starts pounding against itself and against
###186 other objects, and it simply becomes more violent.
###188 Secondly, in hurricanes, you are always talking about sustained winds, winds that will continue
###193 not for a few minutes, but for hour after hour, grinding away, looking for weak spots
###198 around doors or windows or the cornices of roofs. And thirdly, you are talking about
###204 directional wind. That means it`s always going to be attacking from the same direction. So
###208 if it finds that weak spot, it`s going to exploit it, because it just keeps yanking
###213 away at it without letting up. All of that comes together in this terrible witch`s brew
###219 for the cities of the East Coast in the winds of Sandy.
###222 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###223 AZUZ: With storms like Sandy, you expect strong winds and heavy rain, but the different effects
###227 of this storm are almost unbelievable. Water. We mentioned flooding in New York subway.
###233 This is what it looked like. And those water levels won`t go down on their own. That water
###237 is going to have to be pumped out.
###239 Fire. This one broke out in a neighborhood in New York. Sandy`s winds helped it spread.
###244 At least 80 homes were destroyed by the flames.
###247 Snow. Sandy spawned a blizzard in West Virginia. Parts of Maryland and North Carolina were
###253 hit with heavy snow as well. This is what part of the Jersey shore looked like yesterday.
###258 Rows of houses damaged or destroyed by the storm. And along flooded roads, rescue crews
###263 are out in boats and trucks. Some people had to wait on their roof for rescuers to arrive.
###269 Relief organizations are working to get help to the victims of this storm. You can help
###273 them too. Go to the Spotlight section at cnnstudentnews.com and look for the "impact your world" link
###279 to find out how.

###282 MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I want you to be able to get a job. I know
###287 what it takes to get this economy going.
###289 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The most important thing we can
###291 do is to make sure that we are creating job in this country, but not just jobs, good paying
###296 jobs.
###297 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###299 AZUZ: You`ve heard Governor Romney and President Obama talk a lot about the economy in this
###304 presidential campaign. There is a good reason for that. For many voters, it is the most
###308 important issue in the election. It`s also what we are looking at today as we continue
###313 our series on the candidates positions.
###315 Part of Governor Romney`s plan is to cut taxes for all Americans. He would also lower the
###320 tax rate for businesses. The governor`s campaign site says that cutting taxes will help the
###325 economy grow. For example, companies will have more money to hire workers. Romney`s
###330 also talked about making the federal government smaller in order to reduce government spending.
###335 President Obama also wants to lower the tax rate for businesses. For most individual Americans,
###340 he said that he wants to keep the tax rate where it is. But he wants to raise taxes on
###344 wealthy Americans in order to help generate more revenue for the federal government. The
###349 president also wants to create incentives, rewards for companies that bring jobs back
###354 to America.

###356 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to Mr. Butler`s social studies classes
###361 at Atlantis Academy in Coral Springs, Florida. Ichiro Suzuki, Hideki Matsui and Yu Darvish
###369 are known for playing what sport? Here we go, it is basketball, badminton, billiards
###376 or baseball? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###383 They are all Major League Baseball players who were born in Japan. That`s your answer,
###390 and that`s your "Shoutout."
###392 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###393 AZUZ: All right, so in the majors they are probably used to playing in front of sell-out
###398 crowds or near cell out crowds, but back in their home country, some Japanese teams are
###403 struggling with half empty stadiums. So how do you get people to come out and fill the
###408 seats and to root, root, root for the home team? Well, the Yokohama Bay Stars have some
###413 unique ideas. Alex Zolbert steps up to the plate with details.
###417 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###419 ALEX ZOLBERT, CNN ANCHOR: It is arguably Japan`s most popular sport, a national pastime. And
###429 this is the league`s least successful team this year. In fact, the Bay Stars, who hail
###435 from Yokohama just south of Tokyo, have sat in the league`s basement for the past four
###441 years. Which helps explain all the empty seats at one of their final home games this season.
###448 But the team has been testing some clever ideas to try to change that. But in the tough
###453 Japanese economy, how about discounts for fans who are trying to pay off their mortgage?
###459 Or offering refunds if you weren`t satisfied with the team`s performance? A few fans lined
###464 up after a game even though the Bay Starts won. Some of the gimmicks are the idea of
###469 team president, June Ikeida (ph), a 36-year old with a background in advertising and marketing.
###476 He tells me, it`s all in effort to entice folks who aren`t die hard baseball fans. How
###481 about a side show of pro-wrestling?
###484 This stadium holds about 30,000 people. The average attendance this year was just over
###489 half of that. And while the boss recognizes the gimmicks might help, what will help the
###494 most is to win more games.
###497 Alex Zolbert, CNN, Yokohama, Japan.
###499 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###500 AZUZ: Well, next stop today, we have a story about Chy Johnson. She is a sophomore at Quinn
###505 Creek High in Arizona. She was born with a brain disorder, and she said she was bullied
###510 because of that. One day, Chy`s mother emailed a family friend to ask for help. That friend
###516 was Carson Jones. He`s the starting quarterback in the school`s undefeated football team.
###521 Carson heard what was happening and decided to tackle the bullying head on. Now from the
###525 first bell to the last one, Carson and some of his team mates hang out with Chy. They
###530 keep an eye on her, they make sure she is not getting bullied. One of the players says,
###533 it feels good to know that they can help make someone else`s high school experience a positive
###538 one. Great stuff.
###539 Finally today, we are checking out some of your I Report pumpkin projects. Bats on Halloween?
###545 Sure. Bat-man? Well, he can symbolize a dark knight. How about this ghoul climbing out
###550 of the grave? Scary enough to make anyone bury his head under a blanket? Old-time truck,
###555 piles of pumpkins, perfect symbol of the season, but hey, let`s bail on that, so we can check
###560 out these class`s pet project. Seriously, it`s their pet. That`s the tooth. And Becca
###566 (ph) High gets special prays because they love carving pumpkins. And we love that they
###573 do.
###574 That was awesome. Big thanks to everybody who`s sent in I Reports. Goodness gracious,
###580 ghost (ph), we`re out of time for today, so we`ll look forward to seeing you tomorrow
###583 on CNN STUDENT NEWS.
