###24 SAMY AL-JAMAL: In the Middle East, I think people are
###26 warriors by nature.
###30 They're born in conflicts.
###32 They live their whole lives in conflicts.
###34 And I think that martial arts, for them, is something that
###37 suits them perfectly.
###38 
###42 
###68 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###69 SAMY AL-JAMAL: Go, fight.
###71 Let's go.
###73 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###74 
###76 SAMY AL-JAMAL: My parents were Palestinian refugees.
###78 They went to Brazil in the early '60s.
###83 I was born and raised in Brazil.
###86 They came back to Jordan.
###88 They acquired the Jordanian passport and citizenship.
###93 I also did that.
###94 So basically, I'm Brazilian-Jordanian but lived
###99 all my life in Brazil.
###100 And I've been here living for the past five years in Jordan.
###105 My name is Samy Al-Jamal, I'm a fourth degree black belt in
###109 Brazilian jujitsu.
###111 I'm a black belt in judo.
###112 I'm a black belt in Karate, Shotokan.
###114 I needed to defend myself in the streets of Rio.
###117 Rio is not an easy place for you to grow up, especially in
###120 the streets at the time was very violent.
###123 So I decided to start learning martial arts in Brazil.
###127 And since I was five years old up to now, I'm 46, I still
###132 train martial arts.
###134 I decided to come here, stay here, and teach jujitsu for
###140 the Jordanian people, because I thought it would be very
###144 nice for them to learn the true, original jujitsu.
###150 And I stayed here and I opened the school in order to teach
###155 the real jujitsu, the real Brazilian jujitsu.
###159 Overall it's a way of life.
###161 So I thought it was very important for the Jordanian
###163 people to be exposed to that.
###165 And I actually felt a difference here when I first
###168 came and started wrestling with they guys.
###170 I thought they were very strong.
###171 
###183 And I don't think the Muslim empire was an empire just by
###186 chance, because these guys were really, really strong
###189 since back then.
###191 The Source MMA is located in Rabia, which is west Amman, in
###197 the heart of the city.
###198 And our dojo is about 200 meters for training.
###202 I think we are like a mini New York here.
###204 It's like a melting pot of cultures, religions.
###208 And sometimes we have people in the cage behind me here
###212 praying, and right next to them people fighting, and
###216 right behind them people actually doing mixed martial
###218 arts and hitting each other, which I think is a beautiful
###222 scene to watch.
###223 And not many places in the world can have
###225 this type of scenery.
###227 We have foreigners that are non-native Arabic-speaking
###232 people, and because they become Muslim they come to
###238 Jordan, to live in Jordan to live a life of a Muslim.
###243 And they also are into martial arts, so they come
###245 and train with us.
###247 And they're very religious, but at the same time very good
###252 martial artists.
###254 RAMZI NABULSI: My name's Ramzi Nabulsi.
###256 I'm from Australia--
###258 Melbourne, Australia.
###259 
###261 I often get asked why did I come to Jordan.
###264 Why did I leave the land of milk and honey of Australia
###268 and come to the original land of milk and honey?
###271 And the reason for me was to provide an environment for my
###277 children and for my family and myself where we could
###281 spiritually grow as people.
###283 
###295 See this is learning sensitivity and how to stick
###298 to your opponent.
###300 It's very awkward, with the idea of
###304 always remaining stuck.
###305 So it's like a two-man drill.
###307 And then you can start adding strikes and so on.
###313 You win when you can move your opponent.
###316 And you want to do so without having to muscle them.
###320 You're just feeling and finding their center.
###325 The good thing about playing with children is you don't
###327 become aggressive.
###328 
###336 So I live in a little town off Sports City, what's known as
###340 Sports City in Amman.
###342 It's called Haya Karupsha.
###344 And it's known for the many scholars that live here.
###349 The community is people from the US, the UK, Canada,
###354 Australia, India, and local Arabs, Jordanians, and so on.
###361 So it's a big mix of people.
###363 And so we have every color of the rainbow here and many
###368 languages, coming under the same banner or the same
###371 intention to work on themselves and improve
###374 themselves.
###376 
###384 There is a stereotype present within the world that Muslims
###388 have something in their genetics, they just want to
###392 get in to violence and they have a passion for violence.
###399 I'm interested very much in the seeking a supremacy in
###403 fighting in terms of the art form itself.
###406 So I'm looking for excellence of fighting, which I think
###414 comes down to something to do with justice, and so on.
###417 An importance put on being able to stop people
###419 evil with your hand.
###422 So there's a need to do that.
###423 And to do that, I find that martial arts gives you the
###426 tools to do so.
###429 So I don't find martial arts contradicts my faith at all.
###433 And I find that, if anything, it's just a tool in order to
###437 do what I'm supposed to do, which is support what is good
###441 and stop what is bad.
###443 I'm interested in competing at some point in the mixed
###447 martial arts arena and other arenas, very much with the
###453 intention to dispel any myths within myself, what I'm
###461 capable of doing.
###462 I don't want to lie to anyone.
###464 And I don't want to lie to myself.
###466 So I'm studying a number of martial arts--
###469 Brazilian jujitsu, and I come from a background of Kung Fu,
###474 and recently have started Tai Chi.
###477 Much like in the same sentiment as Rickson Gracie
###480 had said in his documentary, "Choke," in order to believe
###485 in what you're doing, you need to be open to competition at
###489 some point.
###490 
###536 SAMY AL-JAMAL: Don't take the back.
###537 Let go.
###537 Take the back.
###538 Go, go.
###539 Two points.
###539 Move, move, move.
###541 Pass the guard.
###544 
###549 What are you doing?
###550 Why is the hand and that leg over there again?
###552 The bottom of the leg.
###554 
###557 Go down.
###557 Go down.
###558 Good guard.
###558 Good guard.
###560 Stop.
###561 Time.
###563 You OK?
###565 No?
###566 It's interesting, you have a lot of female BJJ fighters
###568 here, more than my school in Brazil, more than many schools
###571 that I see outside.
###573 And although the culture here it's a bit restricted towards
###576 women training martial arts, the girls here are doing a
###579 very good job and this year we made two world champions.
###582 
###586 Rana, she came to me, she had never done any sports,
###592 especially any sports that she really had to push hard.
###595 And she started kickboxing with me.
###597 And then she merged into jujitsu.
###600 And last year she competed in the European championship and
###606 Abu Dhabi World Pro Championship.
###608 She won both, the World Pro in her weight and open weight and
###613 the Portugal, also, her weight, without anybody
###616 scoring one advantage on her, which is a huge accomplishment
###619 for anyone.
###621 She's the first Arab woman to do that.
###624 
###627 RANA QUBBAJ: I don't know why, but people think that girls
###630 should be delicate and they should not be strong.
###635 But I was never able to follow that concept, because I think
###639 everybody should be strong because you cannot stand up
###642 for yourself.
###643 Not necessarily like being aggressive, but every person
###646 should be able to stand up on their own.
###649 
###653 My name is Rana Qubbaj.
###655 I like to do MMA and Brazilian jujitsu,
###657 mostly Brazilian jujitsu.
###659 And I train and compete in jujitsu.
###661 
###665 I started doing competitive fighting by chance.
###668 I started doing jujitsu by chance.
###670 I was just looking for a workout to lose
###671 weight and get in shape.
###674 I was a lot overweight.
###675 And I had to lose some weight.
###677 And it was very hard for me to get into working out because I
###680 knew nothing about sports.
###683 I tried to go to the gym, I don't know how
###686 to carry the weight.
###686 I don't know how to do anything.
###687 I tried to jog, I can't jog.
###689 Couldn't do anything.
###689 I was totally out of shape.
###690 I was a smoker.
###692 I never worked out in my life.
###694 So I tried a lot of things for six months.
###698 And then I started kickboxing.
###700 There was a jujitsu team in my gym.
###702 And I kept on looking at them for like 2 and 1/2 years, and
###705 I didn't feel I'm interested.
###706 And then the first time I tried it, I really loved it.
###708 The first time, the first five minutes, I really loved it.
###711 And six months after there was a tournament in Abu Dhabi.
###716 And I decided to try my luck out.
###717 And I loved it.
###719 So I didn't plan for it.
###720 
###723 
###734 OK, so my normal routine is I wake up, like, 5:30 in the
###738 morning, sometimes 6:00 when I'm really tired.
###742 I prepare my food, because I have to eat certain stuff.
###746 So I prepare my food.
###747 I cook whatever I want to cook, whatever.
###750 I have to prepare four meals.
###756 Up to now, I have to eat four meals.
###759 So I prepare my four meals.
###760 And I try to be in the gym like 6:30, 7:00.
###765 I start my morning workout routine, which is basically
###768 cardio, strength, and weight-lifting and strength
###770 exercises and whatever-- balance-- whatever I
###773 need to work on.
###774 So that goes in the morning.
###776 And then I go to work.
###779 I try to be on time at 9:00.
###781 And I work 9-6.
###784 My training is usually at 7:00, my second training.
###788 So I leave from work to the dojo, to the gym.
###793 I'm actually the first Arab girl to win an IBJJF
###796 tournament, which is the International Brazilian
###799 Jujitsu Federation.
###800 These are the tournaments that are organized by the
###803 International Federation.
###804 So they're the hardest to win.
###806 So the Europeans was the first IBJJF tournament
###809 I've ever been to.
###810 And I'm the first Arab girl to win that one.
###814 There are a bit of difficulties actually.
###815 The community's a bit conservative about girls and
###818 guys grappling together and any form of being in very
###828 close distance.
###828 So it's harder here, because girls outside get more
###832 opportunities, or they fight with guys more.
###836 And guys are stronger, physically, obviously.
###838 So that helps you develop your jujitsu more.
###841 
###850 My family, the first time they thought it was just a trip.
###855 They knew I'm fighting but nobody took me seriously.
###857 And I still remember I was pissed off when I lost.
###861 And then my father called and said, how'd it go?
###863 And I was like, I lost.
###864 And he was like, why are you pissed off?
###865 Of course you're going to lose.
###867 So nobody took me seriously the first time.
###870 The second time when I told them I won,
###873 it was like a surprise.
###874 Everyone was surprised.
###875 It's like, how can you win in the Europeans?
###877 
###880 The last competition, the World Forum,
###882 I didn't see that.
###882 I wish I could see that.
###883 But it was on TV.
###885 So my sisters were telling me my parents panicked when they
###887 saw me fighting on TV.
###889 And especially in jujitsu it's sometimes complicated, because
###892 you can be on bottom and winning and you are the one
###896 who's in control and you're the one who's
###897 not in pain or anything.
###899 But it doesn't look this way.
###901 So I was winning all the fights and they were
###903 panicking at home.
###906 So this is my Dad.
###909 RANA'S FATHER: Hello.
###911 RANA QUBBAJ: My dad.
###912 My mom went away.
###915 I don't think that living in my parents' house effects my
###919 ability to be a good fighter, because I know that our world
###922 is conservative, but even not every part of the society is
###927 as conservative.
###928 So my parents have no problem with me going out, training,
###930 travelling to compete.
###932 And I've always travelled before competitions and after
###935 competitions.
###936 So for me, it's not a problem.
###939 I know it might be a problem for other Arab girls.
###941 But for me it's not.
###943 Thank god.
###944 And sometimes guys in this country, unfortunately, have
###948 the habit of just commenting on girls when they're walking.
###953 So it used to annoy me more before I used to do jujitsu.
###960 For example, I never would have stopped at an ATM at
###965 night to withdraw money two years ago.
###968 But now I don't care.
###970 I had to use my jujitsu only once.
###973 I was walking down the street and this guy started making
###977 comments and I ignored him because this is what we do.
###979 We ignore the guys when they do that.
###981 And then he grabbed my hand.
###982 He was like, I'm talking to you.
###984 So I had to use some jujitsu.
###986 But not too much.
###988 
###992 SAMY AL-JAMAL: Every part of society, they have something
###995 against it, which, to me, creates a platform for them to
###1000 show freedom, for them to actually go there and conquer
###1003 their rights and show to people that people are wrong
###1006 through going to championships, conquering
###1010 world championships.
###1011 And that's what I tell them all the time, their results in
###1014 the martial arts is what's going to make people
###1016 understand and except them better.
