1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:14,4



2
0:0:14,4 --> 0:0:16,89
JOSH KALIS: My pops
was moving from


3
0:0:16,89 --> 0:0:19,5
Michigan to Dallas, Texas.


4
0:0:19,5 --> 0:0:22,39
And they didn't want me to be
part of the move, because I


5
0:0:22,39 --> 0:0:24,31
was a bit of a troublemaker.


6
0:0:24,31 --> 0:0:27,25
So him and my mom, who lived in
New York at the time, sent


7
0:0:27,25 --> 0:0:30,28
me to skateboard camp
at Woodward.


8
0:0:30,28 --> 0:0:34,85
And it was there that I met Tony
Mag and filmed a couple


9
0:0:34,85 --> 0:0:36,6
things while at Woodward.


10
0:0:36,6 --> 0:0:37,61
And then he was like,
hey, we're going to


11
0:0:37,61 --> 0:0:38,53
put you on H Street.


12
0:0:38,53 --> 0:0:40,42
And that was it.


13
0:0:40,42 --> 0:0:43,18
Dude, I was super psyched.


14
0:0:43,18 --> 0:0:46,7
I was hyped to get on, but at
the same time it was like all


15
0:0:46,7 --> 0:0:50,33
my favorite skaters, Mike
Carroll and Sean Sheffey and


16
0:0:50,33 --> 0:0:54,3
Sal Barbier and all the illest
dudes rode for H Street.


17
0:0:54,3 --> 0:0:57,14
And they all left right
as I got on.


18
0:0:57,14 --> 0:0:59,16
So I was kind of like, well.


19
0:0:59,16 --> 0:1:0,73
I didn't really give
a shit, man.


20
0:1:0,73 --> 0:1:2,6
I was getting free
H Street boards.


21
0:1:2,6 --> 0:1:4,33
That was tight.


22
0:1:4,33 --> 0:1:7,66
At some point, my mom moved
from New York to Philly.


23
0:1:7,66 --> 0:1:10,22
And when I would visit her,
I would go skate the city.


24
0:1:10,22 --> 0:1:13,49
And this was before me
and Stevie really--


25
0:1:13,49 --> 0:1:15,64
we were just little
skater dudes.


26
0:1:15,64 --> 0:1:16,18
STEVIE WILLIAMS: Oh, man.


27
0:1:16,18 --> 0:1:21,16
The first time I met Josh, I was
with my cousin Russell and


28
0:1:21,16 --> 0:1:22,63
my man Terrence.


29
0:1:22,63 --> 0:1:27,32
And we were skating this skate
spot called Rat Curves.


30
0:1:27,32 --> 0:1:31,382
And Bam Margera and Mike
Maldonado used to skate for H


31
0:1:31,382 --> 0:1:32,95
Street back in the day.


32
0:1:32,95 --> 0:1:33,54
They showed up.


33
0:1:33,54 --> 0:1:38,84
It was like Mike, Bam, Bam's
brother, Bam's dad, and Josh.


34
0:1:38,84 --> 0:1:41,82
And they introduced us, like,
oh, this is Josh.


35
0:1:41,82 --> 0:1:43,5
He's from outside of Philly.


36
0:1:43,5 --> 0:1:44,99
He skates for H Street.


37
0:1:44,99 --> 0:1:45,45
We were like, what?


38
0:1:45,45 --> 0:1:45,74
That's dope.


39
0:1:45,74 --> 0:1:46,6
And he was good.


40
0:1:46,6 --> 0:1:50,56
But I never really tripped off
of it until he came to LOVE


41
0:1:50,56 --> 0:1:52,33
and started skating.


42
0:1:52,33 --> 0:1:53,65
And that's when I
seen him skate.


43
0:1:53,65 --> 0:1:55,51
I was like, damn, that
dude is sick.


44
0:1:55,51 --> 0:1:58,13
And for some reason me and
him just hit it off.


45
0:1:58,13 --> 0:2:0,9
I was good and he was good, but
I never even heard of him


46
0:2:0,9 --> 0:2:1,63
before, though.


47
0:2:1,63 --> 0:2:4,736
I was probably like
11 years old.


48
0:2:4,736 --> 0:2:5,92
JOSH KALIS: What would
you call this?


49
0:2:5,92 --> 0:2:6,86
MALE SPEAKER: A shrine.


50
0:2:6,86 --> 0:2:8,35
JOSH KALIS: Shrine?


51
0:2:8,35 --> 0:2:9,31
My LOVE shrine?


52
0:2:9,31 --> 0:2:12,52
Does it look like a shrine?


53
0:2:12,52 --> 0:2:13,884
It does, huh?


54
0:2:13,884 --> 0:2:15,7
Damn.


55
0:2:15,7 --> 0:2:19,42
I wasn't really going
for the shrine look.


56
0:2:19,42 --> 0:2:21,16
We skated together
all the time.


57
0:2:21,16 --> 0:2:23,28
And we just clicked at LOVE.


58
0:2:23,28 --> 0:2:25,3
STEVIE WILLIAMS: Coming
downtown, I was looking


59
0:2:25,3 --> 0:2:27,32
forward to seeing Josh.


60
0:2:27,32 --> 0:2:29,28
That made me want to
get sponsored.


61
0:2:29,28 --> 0:2:31,44
And he was already sponsored,
so he would just give us


62
0:2:31,44 --> 0:2:32,315
boards, wheels.


63
0:2:32,315 --> 0:2:36,78
And one day we were skating,
and I learned kickflip


64
0:2:36,78 --> 0:2:37,95
noseslides.


65
0:2:37,95 --> 0:2:39,62
And then he learned kickflip
noseslides.


66
0:2:39,62 --> 0:2:40,91
Then he learned kickflip
noseslides and


67
0:2:40,91 --> 0:2:41,86
ollie heel flip it.


68
0:2:41,86 --> 0:2:42,87
He had every trick.


69
0:2:42,87 --> 0:2:44,91
He could do everything.


70
0:2:44,91 --> 0:2:46,475
RICKY OYOLA: I don't
know how Josh came.


71
0:2:46,475 --> 0:2:48,3
I don't know if it was
a relative, or--


72
0:2:48,3 --> 0:2:49,135
but yeah, he came.


73
0:2:49,135 --> 0:2:52,17
And he was really good, man.


74
0:2:52,17 --> 0:2:53,83
He was really good.


75
0:2:53,83 --> 0:2:56,28
I wish dudes like that would
skate our way, too.


76
0:2:56,28 --> 0:2:58,82
There still wasn't anybody who
was exploring the city like we


77
0:2:58,82 --> 0:3:0,86
always did.


78
0:3:0,86 --> 0:3:3,31
JOSH KALIS: Top of the food
chain in Philly was Ricky.


79
0:3:3,31 --> 0:3:5,79
I was definitely
hierarchy shit.


80
0:3:5,79 --> 0:3:10,95
Because Ricky had rules where
you couldn't film unless you


81
0:3:10,95 --> 0:3:13,69
were pushing switch switch.


82
0:3:13,69 --> 0:3:16,5
Like if you're doing switch
mongo, you ain't fucking


83
0:3:16,5 --> 0:3:17,89
filming it at LOVE.


84
0:3:17,89 --> 0:3:19,95
That's when Ricky and those
dudes ran LOVE.


85
0:3:19,95 --> 0:3:21,3
And they had their rules.


86
0:3:21,3 --> 0:3:23,13
And they had their
whole thing.


87
0:3:23,13 --> 0:3:24,36
You know what I'm saying?


88
0:3:24,36 --> 0:3:28,6
At the time, the very first
"TransWorld" article on


89
0:3:28,6 --> 0:3:30,6
Philadelphia was there then.


90
0:3:30,6 --> 0:3:32,84
And a few of us shot
some stuff.


91
0:3:32,84 --> 0:3:36,22
And it was told, don't
use that shit.


92
0:3:36,22 --> 0:3:39,5
DGK didn't exist for a while.


93
0:3:39,5 --> 0:3:43,2
And then he turned that other
side of LOVE park into DGK,


94
0:3:43,2 --> 0:3:44,6
the Dirty Ghetto Kids.


95
0:3:44,6 --> 0:3:45,38
And it was because of that.


96
0:3:45,38 --> 0:3:46,27
STEVIE WILLIAMS: At that
time, there was


97
0:3:46,27 --> 0:3:47,23
two different cliques.


98
0:3:47,23 --> 0:3:52,1
It was our clique, the DGK
clique, and then it was Ricky


99
0:3:52,1 --> 0:3:54,22
Oyola and all of those dudes.


100
0:3:54,22 --> 0:3:55,91
RICKY OYOLA: I don't think a
lot of those dudes, the DGK


101
0:3:55,91 --> 0:3:58,42
dudes, I don't think they liked
the fact that Matt and I


102
0:3:58,42 --> 0:4:1,66
were the ones who were most
known and Philadelphia was


103
0:4:1,66 --> 0:4:2,73
kind of ours.


104
0:4:2,73 --> 0:4:3,84
We created that.


105
0:4:3,84 --> 0:4:5,33
You know what I mean?


106
0:4:5,33 --> 0:4:9,46
So it was kind of ours
in such a way.


107
0:4:9,46 --> 0:4:12,22
STEVIE WILLIAMS: Whoever came to
Philly was supposed to hang


108
0:4:12,22 --> 0:4:14,94
with Ricky and Matt and
all of them dudes.


109
0:4:14,94 --> 0:4:18,23
And, see, Fred Gall, when
he came, he didn't come


110
0:4:18,23 --> 0:4:19,1
and hang with us.


111
0:4:19,1 --> 0:4:20,7
He went to hang with Ricky.


112
0:4:20,7 --> 0:4:21,98
And Josh was never their dude.


113
0:4:21,98 --> 0:4:23,48
Josh was like--


114
0:4:23,48 --> 0:4:24,58
he took to us.


115
0:4:24,58 --> 0:4:27,0
So every time he came to the
city, he came over and


116
0:4:27,0 --> 0:4:27,79
chilled with us.


117
0:4:27,79 --> 0:4:29,4
MALE SPEAKER: [BEATBOXING].


118
0:4:29,4 --> 0:4:32,38



119
0:4:32,38 --> 0:4:34,79
STEVIE WILLIAMS: He always had
the swag, but he wasn't the


120
0:4:34,79 --> 0:4:36,62
white dude that tried
to act black.


121
0:4:36,62 --> 0:4:38,77
He was just the white
dude with swag.


122
0:4:38,77 --> 0:4:40,8
Everybody liked him, from white
people to black people.


123
0:4:40,8 --> 0:4:42,5
The girls loved him.


124
0:4:42,5 --> 0:4:43,23
He was Josh.


125
0:4:43,23 --> 0:4:44,76
Everybody knew he had value.


126
0:4:44,76 --> 0:4:48,33
No matter what city he was in,
he brought value to that city.


127
0:4:48,33 --> 0:4:52,33
At the end of the day, he was
taking all their shine.


128
0:4:52,33 --> 0:4:54,34
And Ricky was supposed to
be the king of Philly.


129
0:4:54,34 --> 0:4:57,2
And you got all of these dudes
following his lead and shit.


130
0:4:57,2 --> 0:5:0,8
And then here come Josh
that's like, I'm not


131
0:5:0,8 --> 0:5:0,74
following your lead.


132
0:5:0,74 --> 0:5:3,47
I'm actually rocking with
the ghetto kids.


133
0:5:3,47 --> 0:5:5,37
And they definitely didn't
like that shit.


134
0:5:5,37 --> 0:5:8,79
JOSH KALIS: Me and Ricky got
along pretty good until he


135
0:5:8,79 --> 0:5:11,37
thought I fucked his ex-chick.


136
0:5:11,37 --> 0:5:14,955
And then that started up a whole
fucking shit storm of


137
0:5:14,955 --> 0:5:17,36
beef between me and Ricky.


138
0:5:17,36 --> 0:5:19,78
And that carried to
San Francisco.


139
0:5:19,78 --> 0:5:20,89
It carried all over the place.


140
0:5:20,89 --> 0:5:22,33
We had crazy beef.


141
0:5:22,33 --> 0:5:23,67
RICKY OYOLA: Yeah, yeah.


142
0:5:23,67 --> 0:5:27,73
There were some issues and stuff
like that, some just


143
0:5:27,73 --> 0:5:30,5
stupid shit that went down.


144
0:5:30,5 --> 0:5:33,1
STEVIE WILLIAMS: I think just
that situation was easier for


145
0:5:33,1 --> 0:5:34,55
Ricky to say, fuck you, Josh.


146
0:5:34,55 --> 0:5:35,91
Get out of my city.


147
0:5:35,91 --> 0:5:37,43
And Josh left.


148
0:5:37,43 --> 0:5:40,23
It wasn't like, we going
to retaliate.


149
0:5:40,23 --> 0:5:41,26
Josh just left.


150
0:5:41,26 --> 0:5:42,79
And I was like, damn.


151
0:5:42,79 --> 0:5:45,29
There go our town hero, our dude
to get our free boards.


152
0:5:45,29 --> 0:5:47,6
It was over.


153
0:5:47,6 --> 0:5:49,64
JOSH KALIS: Rumors were I
wasn't allowed there.


154
0:5:49,64 --> 0:5:52,77
And I went back on that
Invisible tour and was like,


155
0:5:52,77 --> 0:5:54,42
hey, bro, here I am.


156
0:5:54,42 --> 0:5:56,26
And Ricky was like, you know
what, you're going


157
0:5:56,26 --> 0:6:0,5
to be pro, I'm pro.


158
0:6:0,5 --> 0:6:1,91
We shouldn't just fucking
be at each other's


159
0:6:1,91 --> 0:6:2,85
throat every time.


160
0:6:2,85 --> 0:6:4,13
So just respect.


161
0:6:4,13 --> 0:6:6,2
If I'm here, don't be here.


162
0:6:6,2 --> 0:6:8,16
If you're here, I
ain't coming in.


163
0:6:8,16 --> 0:6:10,7
And we just kind of rode it
out like that for a while,


164
0:6:10,7 --> 0:6:14,56
until when I moved back to
Philly then we squashed it.


165
0:6:14,56 --> 0:6:17,11
And Ricky found out I didn't
fuck the chick and apologized.


166
0:6:17,11 --> 0:6:18,76
And it was all good.


167
0:6:18,76 --> 0:6:19,65
RICKY OYOLA: Look,
I'm older now.


168
0:6:19,65 --> 0:6:21,14
And I just thought back.


169
0:6:21,14 --> 0:6:23,93
It was always kind of
like this fake beef.


170
0:6:23,93 --> 0:6:26,46
Because it really
wasn't any beef.


171
0:6:26,46 --> 0:6:27,96
There wasn't any.


172
0:6:27,96 --> 0:6:28,95
We're two different people.


173
0:6:28,95 --> 0:6:29,86
I'm from the woods.


174
0:6:29,86 --> 0:6:30,91
They're from the city.


175
0:6:30,91 --> 0:6:32,85
Skating was something
we had in common.


176
0:6:32,85 --> 0:6:34,96
But we didn't skate
the same way.


177
0:6:34,96 --> 0:6:40,9
And LOVE park was their
playground that hooked them


178
0:6:40,9 --> 0:6:41,6
up, got them on DC.


179
0:6:41,6 --> 0:6:42,85
And look where they're at now.


180
0:6:42,85 --> 0:6:54,13



181
0:6:54,13 --> 0:6:55,64
Just his tre flips--


182
0:6:55,64 --> 0:6:57,22
tre flips are my
favorite trick.


183
0:6:57,22 --> 0:6:59,18
And he's seriously got tops.


184
0:6:59,18 --> 0:7:1,48
He's got one of the best ones
ever, to tell you the truth.


185
0:7:1,48 --> 0:7:2,17
Stevie's got it also.


186
0:7:2,17 --> 0:7:3,87
Stevie's got a great
switch flip.


187
0:7:3,87 --> 0:7:4,8
He's just really good.


188
0:7:4,8 --> 0:7:8,59
Josh's style is what I like
more than anything.


189
0:7:8,59 --> 0:7:10,18
His big spins and
tail slides--


190
0:7:10,18 --> 0:7:13,9
I wish I could do that shit.


191
0:7:13,9 --> 0:7:14,45
I mean, I don't want
to spend two years


192
0:7:14,45 --> 0:7:16,17
trying to do it once.


193
0:7:16,17 --> 0:7:18,55
That's going to be a shitty
two years of my skating.


194
0:7:18,55 --> 0:7:19,97
I might do it.


195
0:7:19,97 --> 0:7:21,22
But that's no fun.


196
0:7:21,22 --> 0:9:21,22
