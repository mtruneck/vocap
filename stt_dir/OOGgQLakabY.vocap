###18 ADRI MURGUIA: Hey, this is Adri.
###19 And we're here in Santa Clarita Valley to meet up with
###22 Jamie Nudie, who is Nudie Cohn's granddaughter.
###25 And she is carrying on his legacy.
###27 Let's go find out what this is about.
###29 Hi.
###30 How are you?
###31 JAMIE NUDIE: I'm great.
###31 How are you?
###32 ADRI MURGUIA: Good.
###32 I'm Adri.
###33 JAMIE NUDIE: Nice to meet you.
###34 I'm Jamie.
###34 Please come in.
###36 
###42 My grandfather was Nudie.
###44 He went by one name only.
###46 He immigrated here from Kiev, Russia at age 11.
###49 He settled in New York.
###51 He first started making g-strings for all the
###53 showgirls, and just had a flair for it.
###58 And he traveled to Mankato, Minnesota, where he met my
###61 grandmother.
###62 They fell in love, and finally settled in Hollywood.
###66 He loved old Western film.
###68 And he'd sit there, and he thought, gosh, they sort of
###71 were missing something on stage.
###73 And he came up with the idea of putting
###75 rhinestones on clothing.
###76 He first approached Lefty Frizzell.
###79 And he said, Lefty, if you've got the guts to wear a shirt
###82 of mine, I'll make it for you, free of charge.
###85 If it takes off, you'll start to pay me.
###88 Lefty got up on stage, and it was a hit.
###91 They got a storefront on Victory and Vineland in the
###95 early '60s, and approached Roy and Dale when Roy was working
###99 for Republic Studios.
###101 And Roy had said to him, I've heard about you around town.
###104 And sure I'll let you do some work for me.
###106 But I want the kid in the nosebleed section to be able
###110 to see me.
###110 -It's the king of the cowboys, Roy Rogers.
###114 And here he is.
###115 
###118 JAMIE NUDIE: So my grandfather made shirts
###121 for Roy with fringe.
###123 And on every piece of fringe was a rhinestone.
###127 And when Roy got up on stage, that kid in the nosebleed
###130 section saw Roy.
###131 The lights hit the fringe and the fringe danced.
###134 And it would sway back and forth.
###136 From there it just took off.
###138 Everybody had heard of Nudie, and wanted to come into his
###141 business, and have him make suits for him.
###144 This is a vintage that was done for "Rodeo Queen." And
###149 you can see, who's got a waist that small?
###153 ADRI MURGUIA: Where did he get all the rhinestones?
###154 JAMIE NUDIE: The rhinestones were actually
###156 shipped in from New York.
###157 ADRI MURGUIA: Really?
###157 JAMIE NUDIE: Yeah.
###158 This was done for an Elvis impersonator.
###162 ADRI MURGUIA: This is like a replica?
###163 JAMIE NUDIE: It's a replica, yes.
###165 ADRI MURGUIA: This is so crazy.
###166 JAMIE NUDIE: Love the gold lame.
###169 ADRI MURGUIA: Where's the original?
###171 JAMIE NUDIE: The original is in Graceland.
###172 ADRI MURGUIA: Oh, right.
###174 JAMIE NUDIE: Colonel gave it to the museum.
###176 And that's where the original's at.
###179 Here's a photograph.
###180 This was probably in the early '50s, Oh, '57.
###184 Here's Colonel here, and Elvis, and Nudie.
###187 Nearly and Colonel Parker were great friends.
###190 Colonel Parker had been manager for other artists, and
###194 Colonel had come to Nudie and said, I'm
###197 taking on this new act.
###199 He said, I want you to make something for him that's out
###202 of this world spectacular.
###204 In 1957, the gold lame suit for Elvis was born.
###209 And, as a matter fact, my mother was a young girl.
###212 And Colonel and Nudie got together and surprised my
###215 mother on her 18th birthday, having Elvis sing.
###218 They went on a date.
###219 The gold lame suit was a huge hit.
###222 Here is Nudie on the cover of "Rolling Stone" in 1969, the
###227 same year that John and Yoko are in bed again.
###232 I mean, who makes the cover of "Rolling Stone"?
###233 He was an immigrant from Kiev, Russia, and he makes the cover
###238 of "Rolling Stone" in '69.
###239 That's crazy.
###240 ADRI MURGUIA: He looks so badass.
###241 JAMIE NUDIE: Yeah.
###244 Not only did Nudie make a lot of the clothes.
###247 But through the 50 years of business, he made 18 cars.
###251 He thought he needed a calling card.
###255 ADRI MURGUIA: Oh my god.
###256 
###263 I mean, it's like in perfect--
###265 JAMIE NUDIE: It's in perfect condition.
###266 It has under 30,000 miles on it.
###268 ADRI MURGUIA: I have four guns right here.
###271 Just here I have four guns.
###272 
###275 And you take this out?
###276 JAMIE NUDIE: Yeah.
###278 He started with a 1950 Hudson, and went on to Pontiac
###281 Bonnevilles.
###282 And not too many people had white cars back in those days.
###285 And so he was kind of like the first to set the market and
###289 have a white car, but then put steerhorns and guns and silver
###294 dollars on it.
###295 And some cars had embroidered seats.
###298 We called them the horny cars.
###300 
###302 In the '70s and in the '80s, all the rock groups started
###305 wearing them.
###306 It wasn't just Western film.
###307 It was Chicago, America, ZZ Top, Bootsy Collins, Teddy
###313 Pendergrass, a lot of rock groups and stuff that he had
###318 done it for.
###319 It was something that was unique, one of a kind,
###323 eccentric, very out of this world.
###327 For example, in the '70s, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Gram
###330 Parsons, him and Nudie were more like father son.
###334 And he looked up to my
###336 grandfather as a father figure.
###339 Here's the Flying Burrito Brothers.
###340 There's Gram Parsons with the famous pill, marijuana suit.
###345 Here's a replica of Gram Parsons's.
###349 ADRI MURGUIA: Oh my god, the pills.
###351 JAMIE NUDIE: You can see the back.
###353 ADRI MURGUIA: Love that.
###354 
###357 Do you ever wear this?
###357 JAMIE NUDIE: I do.
###358 ADRI MURGUIA: Does it look cool?
###359 JAMIE NUDIE: Now you have officially been Nudified.
###361 ADRI MURGUIA: I've been Nudified.
###363 Oh my god, so great.
###368 This one is the best.
###369 Do you thing you're going to bring it back, like
###371 you're going to--
###372 JAMIE NUDIE: Oh, I know I will.
###372 ADRI MURGUIA: Yeah?
###373 JAMIE NUDIE: Yeah.
###374 
###376 ADRI MURGUIA: I really want one.
###379 JAMIE NUDIE: Well, you can get a Nudie T-shirt.
###381 I want to be able to educate our younger generation to know
###385 that you can be anybody.
###387 And you can do anything if you set your mind to it.
###390 If you have the drive, and you have the
###392 ambition, you can do that.
###394 And that's what I feel as though I'm here for, to
###397 further educate younger generations, let them know
###400 that you can do something like this.
###402 And have an idea, and let it sparkle.
###406 Put a rhinestone on it.
