1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,31



2
0:0:4,31 --> 0:0:6,31



3
0:0:6,31 --> 0:0:8,69
You know, the hot tub is cool now


4
0:0:8,69 --> 0:0:9,65
But they poisoned it


5
0:0:9,65 --> 0:0:11,59
I know, right… how? 


6
0:0:11,59 --> 0:0:13,63
Sing me some harmonies!


7
0:0:13,63 --> 0:0:16,74
It's a small picture in a shop somewhere


8
0:0:16,74 --> 0:0:18,37
And I know who it is!


9
0:0:18,37 --> 0:0:20,26
It's Mormon Judy


10
0:0:20,26 --> 0:0:21,76
And cow people.


11
0:0:21,76 --> 0:0:22,84
A little pitchy


12
0:0:22,84 --> 0:0:23,75
But mmm


13
0:0:23,75 --> 0:0:24,79
Good stuff!


14
0:0:24,79 --> 0:0:26,45
Governor Romney's black


15
0:0:26,45 --> 0:0:29,64
I mean, uh, I think "black" can be judged—


16
0:0:29,64 --> 0:0:30,58
How do I do this?


17
0:0:30,58 --> 0:0:32,63
Dude, I don't have a Jet-Ski…


18
0:0:32,63 --> 0:0:34,35
Not the kind you're talking about.


19
0:0:34,35 --> 0:0:37,26
Plus everyone can see that I'm not black.


20
0:0:37,26 --> 0:0:39,72
I mean, this isn't scientific stuff!


21
0:0:39,72 --> 0:0:42,14
I heard there's not going to be a test!


22
0:0:42,14 --> 0:0:45,5
But I mean, I do want you to support me and be my man…


23
0:0:45,5 --> 0:0:46,93
That's beautiful!


24
0:0:46,93 --> 0:0:48,96
I know he's black…


25
0:0:48,96 --> 0:0:53,33
Ahmed, how did you know about whodunnit in the lounge?


26
0:0:53,33 --> 0:0:54,65
I didn't know.


27
0:0:54,65 --> 0:0:56,93
Oh, you didn't! Oh, oh, well they started clapping


28
0:0:56,93 --> 0:0:58,83
for the mad cow!


29
0:0:58,83 --> 0:1:1,2
Until someone sold him


30
0:1:1,2 --> 0:1:4,29
And then, and then when he died, they had him stuffed!


31
0:1:4,29 --> 0:1:5,34
Like that water buffalo…


32
0:1:5,34 --> 0:1:7,12
Stuffed.


33
0:1:7,12 --> 0:1:8,51
That dude's the sickest. 


34
0:1:8,51 --> 0:1:9,42
We hate him.


35
0:1:9,42 --> 0:1:11,63
Because he had eggs for a bath.


36
0:1:11,63 --> 0:1:13,18
Gonna throw up tonight.


37
0:1:13,18 --> 0:1:15,44
Ahhh, but if you throw up


38
0:1:15,44 --> 0:1:18,4
Then it's as a jealous woman.


39
0:1:18,4 --> 0:1:23,3
In horrible weather, I sneeze and I just lose the puppets.


40
0:1:23,3 --> 0:1:25,98
I'm thinking, Governor Romney won't do that, ok?


41
0:1:25,98 --> 0:1:28,72
And this has got me thinking…


42
0:1:28,72 --> 0:1:30,9
I see a purple


43
0:1:30,9 --> 0:1:31,65
idiot


44
0:1:31,65 --> 0:1:32,69
Who speaks German


45
0:1:32,69 --> 0:1:35,57
With a big, spunky, Irish Labradoodle puppy.


46
0:1:35,57 --> 0:1:36,85
Ohh, he got me


47
0:1:36,85 --> 0:1:38,8
And I want you to feel bad


48
0:1:38,8 --> 0:1:41,16
'Cause I've got funny radiation coming up on my desk and it's too much


49
0:1:41,16 --> 0:1:42,91
Ah come on, I'm not a robot, okay.


50
0:1:42,91 --> 0:1:44,2
I wish.


51
0:1:44,2 --> 0:1:45,83
Then I could go higher, and you could rotate my arm 


52
0:1:45,83 --> 0:1:47,91
and send me whooshing into space


53
0:1:47,91 --> 0:1:49,9
Can you hear me?


54
0:1:49,9 --> 0:1:52,57
Now Matt, shush, because the sofa bears don't know.


55
0:1:52,57 --> 0:1:55,73
Go ride off, and I'll defeat 17 bears while you're gone


56
0:1:55,73 --> 0:1:59,69
But first I want you two to turn and look at each other.


57
0:1:59,69 --> 0:2:1,27
Yeah.


58
0:2:1,27 --> 0:2:3,9
Oh, now that's nice.


59
0:2:3,9 --> 0:2:5,79
Just stare deeply into each other's eyes.


60
0:2:5,79 --> 0:2:7,19
Yeah.


61
0:2:7,19 --> 0:2:9,52
Good, now say the first thing that pops into your brain!


62
0:2:9,52 --> 0:2:11,11
I don't want to touch sandpaper.


63
0:2:11,11 --> 0:2:12,56
I like "The Wiz"!


64
0:2:12,56 --> 0:2:14,15
Okay, all right


65
0:2:14,15 --> 0:2:15,85
Now I want to try something


66
0:2:15,85 --> 0:2:16,82
Why don't we go, "mmmm"


67
0:2:16,82 --> 0:2:19,36
Just go, "mmmmmmmmm"


68
0:2:19,36 --> 0:2:20,78
"Mmmmmmmmmmmm…."


69
0:2:20,78 --> 0:2:21,79
"Mmmmmmm…"


70
0:2:21,79 --> 0:2:24,0
"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm…"


71
0:2:24,0 --> 0:2:26,17
Yeah, ok, good, that's what I want you to do.


72
0:2:26,17 --> 0:2:28,37
Now follow my lead.


73
0:2:28,37 --> 0:2:30,69
I'm jumping in a pimento shower.


74
0:2:30,69 --> 0:2:32,68
I wanted the music first.


75
0:2:32,68 --> 0:2:35,17
In the tragic square of the Fresh Prince


76
0:2:35,17 --> 0:2:38,68
There went a perfect brown baby.


77
0:2:38,68 --> 0:2:42,99
The guards can see we're all out of weapons, no machetes


78
0:2:42,99 --> 0:2:45,56
Lotion raw bruises


79
0:2:45,56 --> 0:2:48,47
Lotion raw bruises.


80
0:2:48,47 --> 0:2:49,31
Drink


81
0:2:49,31 --> 0:2:50,35
Or sip


82
0:2:50,35 --> 0:2:51,24
A wench


83
0:2:51,24 --> 0:2:52,31
At our hotel


84
0:2:52,31 --> 0:2:53,57
Wolf government


85
0:2:53,57 --> 0:2:54,54
Anchovies


86
0:2:54,54 --> 0:2:56,77
When they laugh at you, you'll drown


87
0:2:56,77 --> 0:2:59,32
Eye of the Sparrow


88
0:2:59,32 --> 0:3:3,4
This girl slipped on my arrow.


89
0:3:3,4 --> 0:3:4,6



90
0:3:4,6 --> 0:3:7,3
I love you two, okay?


91
0:3:7,3 --> 0:3:9,14
Now I want you to turn and look at me.


92
0:3:9,14 --> 0:3:10,64
[snoring sounds]


93
0:3:10,64 --> 0:3:13,36
Ahmed?


94
0:3:13,36 --> 0:3:14,34
Yeah


95
0:3:14,34 --> 0:3:15,86
Uhhh, he's asleep…


96
0:3:15,86 --> 0:3:17,69
Ah! Oh!


97
0:3:17,69 --> 0:3:19,44
It's party time, chumps!


98
0:3:19,44 --> 0:3:20,43
Drink! [Drink!]


99
0:3:20,43 --> 0:3:21,4
Or sip! [Sip!]


100
0:3:21,4 --> 0:3:23,28
A wench at our hotel!


101
0:3:23,28 --> 0:3:24,52
Wolf government!


102
0:3:24,52 --> 0:3:25,53
Anchovies!


103
0:3:25,53 --> 0:3:28,6
If they laugh at you, you'll drown!


104
0:3:28,6 --> 0:3:29,7
Eye of the Sparrow!


105
0:3:29,7 --> 0:3:30,5
Eye of the Sparrow!


106
0:3:30,5 --> 0:3:34,33
That girl slipped on my arrow!


107
0:3:34,33 --> 0:3:35,36
Drink!


108
0:3:35,36 --> 0:3:36,26
Or sip!


109
0:3:36,26 --> 0:3:37,48
Anchovies!


110
0:3:37,48 --> 0:3:38,41
GO!


111
0:3:38,41 --> 0:5:38,41
