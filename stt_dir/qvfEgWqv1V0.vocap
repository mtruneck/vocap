###24 -Whoa.
###26 
###28 It's been a couple of torturous days of riding the
###35 dirtiest, sandiest, windiest conditions.
###38 It's nice to be somewhere moist and warm.
###42 
###47 How is it?
###48 
###57 -This is paradise.
###58 You can't open your beer.
###61 -Home spa.
###62 
###66 -Oh!
###68 -Save it.
###69 Save it.

###179 ARTO SAARI: I think Patrick sent me either a text message,
###182 or he might have called me, actually.
###184 And said, you want to go to Baja with a bunch of people,
###188 and go ride motorcycles and skateboard?
###191 And I was like, fuck, that sounds amazing and dangerous.
###195 Yeah, let's go.
###196 
###198 I went on a trip with Heath before, an Alien trip.
###203 I've seen Patrick around, but I'd never traveled with him.
###207 Right as Patrick called me, I was reading a newspaper.
###211 I think it was like three newspapers that I saw in the
###215 next three days that all had front page news about drug
###219 cartels in Mexico.
###221 And of course I read them all and I was just so freaked out.
###225 I was like, oh, this is what it's going to be like.
###227 It's going to be all about just craziness.
###229 
###232 I felt like whoever's going to come on the trip, they're
###235 going to be fucking badass.
###237 And they're going to fucking stick through it.
###239 And that's it, whoever shows up.
###242 HEATH KIRCHART: This is my main mode of transportation.
###244 I ride a motorcycle like it's A to B at this point.
###249 I don't really care where I go.
###251 I care who I go with, and as long as I'll be comfortable.
###255 Arto had been like on a four day trip.
###258 He was on a tour with Alien and tripped
###260 with us for four days.
###262 And we rode in separate cars.
###264 Like, I didn't really know Arto before this.
###266 They're people I respect.
###267 So they're people I like to know.
###268 And it's good for these trips for that to force me into
###272 that, basically, to get to know them.
###278 I'm old and these trips are gone.
###281 So I take them when I can get them.
###285 PATRICK O'DELL: I think I just thought the more the better.
###287 And anyone that's down, I feel like anyone that you tell, OK,
###290 we're going to ride-- how many miles is it?
###292 2,000 miles or something through the desert.
###295 Anyone that's down to do that should get to come.
###298 Because they're down to do that.
###302 [CAR HORN]
###304 HIME HERBERT: Fuck.
###305 
###311 My real name's actually James David Herbert the Fourth.
###315 But everybody calls me Hime.
###317 Patrick sent me a text message that said we're going to Baja
###320 for a few days.
###322 He said two guys from Vancouver were coming.
###324 Harvey and Ky showed up.
###326 I introduced myself, saw Harvey didn't
###330 have a front tooth.
###330 And I knew from that point on this was going
###333 to be pretty epic.
###334 [LAUGHING].
###336 Most people I know without front teeth are pretty epic.
###339 HARVEY FOSTER: And the truth of the trip, too.
###342 Ky told me about the Mexico trip, and I was like, there's
###345 like gang wars and killings and swine flu.
###350 What?
###350 Why?
###351 Why would you want to put yourself through that.
###353 He was like, Harvey, man, that's just the TV.
###356 I'm going to do it.
###358 I was like, all right.
###359 OK.
###359 I'm with you on these trips.
###361 [MOTORS RUMBLING]
###365 HARVEY FOSTER: All it takes is someone to plan something out.
###367 I usually jump on board.
###369 [MUSIC - ROLLA OLAK, "WNTYO"]
###400 ARTO SAARI: As soon as I got on the bike, I was antsy.
###404 I was shit scared until we got 20 minutes
###406 away from the border.
###409 HARVEY FOSTER: I loved it.
###411 When we were riding into Tijuana, I think I was the
###414 only one that noticed that big ass Mexican flag.
###416 And I was like, we're doing this right now.
###419 We're entering their fucking territory.
###421 And then everyone's like, we're going to blast through.
###423 Don't worry everyone.
###424 But the whole time, I was like, I want to just chill.
###427 There's all these Mexicans standing here.
###430 I've never been to Mexico.
###432 I've seen Mexicans in California, but then I just
###435 think they're like now Americans, right?
###438 So I was like, whoa.
###440 They're just sitting on a fence.
###442 Why are they just sitting on-- what?
###444 Are they going to try to make a run for the border?
###447 And everyone was blasting ahead.
###449 And I was like, well, there's someone behind me kind of
###451 going a bit slower.
###452 So can I slow down a little bit, too?
###455 I liked that first day, though.
###457 I had a lot of fun.
###458 
###462 ARTO SAARI: Just driving next to the wall coming out of TJ
###465 through the border and cutting across to the beach, with a
###468 lot of wind and a lot of sand in your face between trucks
###471 and cars and this and that.
###473 It's just like [GASPING]
###475 oh fuck.
###477 And I didn't know anything about Baja.
###480 Whatever.
###480 After we got through the first toll booth, it was just like,
###483 oh, it's going to be good.
###485

###494 BILL BRYANT: I think my first time in Baja was 1984.
###498 Came down to help pit crew for a local racer.
###501 And that sort of cracked the seal on the whole Baja thing.
###505 I've been coming down ever since.
###509 This was a different group than what I'm used to riding
###511 with, because no one had ridden
###512 together, as far as I know.
###513 Well, Canadians had ridden with Heath, and what have you.
###516 But there wasn't a whole lot of experience riding together.
###520 One of the first things that I asked, is it a bunch of
###522 spoiled brat kids?
###523 Because you're pretty much on your own and just have to be
###526 self-reliant.
###527 And there's not a whole lot of external help.
###530 You can't really trust the police.
###531 You don't know whether to trust the army.
###533 And that's part of what makes me consider it
###537 sort of Wild West-like.
###538 
###542 It depends.
###543 In Ensanada, you got to wear your helmet, or they're going
###546 to pull you over.
###547 I've gone everywhere else on the peninsula without it, and
###551 had no problem.
###553 How are you going to prove that there's a helmet law or
###554 there's not a helmet law?
###555 I don't know, you know what I mean?
###556 
###564 [MUSIC - ROLLA OLAK, "SWAMP FANG"]
###565 
###573 BILL BRYANT: We've done a bunch of racing down here.
###575 So we've been on a lot of the stuff that you can't pass in a
###579 regular car.
###580 Or some stuff you can, but you would just never go in a
###582 regular car to try and discover it, because you don't
###583 know what you're getting into.
###585 
###588 The road to Cuatros I think was a surprise to the guys.
###592 There wasn't a whole lot of information given to everybody
###593 before on what exactly to expect.
###595 We had that little informal breakfast, and
###598 I said a few things.
###599 And maybe somebody listened.
###600 I don't know.
###600 HEATH KIRCHART: I had no idea what he said.
###602 BILL BRYANT: And I don't even know if I
###603 mentioned the dirt road.
###605 [TIRE POPPING]
###606 PATRICK O'DELL: [SHOUT].
###607 Damn it.
###609 Fuck.
###611 We just turn off, and I'm thinking it's like right
###613 there, right off the highway, the hotel was going
###617 to be, or the spot.
###619 But it was miles.
###621 Like you get over a hill thinking, OK, it's going to be
###623 right there.
###623 And then I remember seeing the ocean, and
###625 nothing in any direction.
###627 And I remember seeing way off in the distance some smoke,
###630 and thinking there's no way that's where we're going.
###633 And it was.
###634 
###640 HARVEY FOSTER: That was fun, though, man.
###642 And it was kind of like, yeah, totally destination unknown.
###645 
###658 [MOTORS RUMBLING]
###678 -Fucking great ride, guys.
###680 -Nailed it.
