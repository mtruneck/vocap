0:0:5,148 --> 0:0:7,43
JOE CROW RYAN: It's very
important to be able to


3
0:0:7,43 --> 0:0:9,96
exercise indifference to
anything if you're going to


4
0:0:9,96 --> 0:0:11,93
enjoy your stay in Brooklyn.


5
0:0:11,93 --> 0:0:14,165
And we know you're not
all from here.


6
0:0:14,165 --> 0:0:15,12
And that's OK.


7

We're famous for that.

0:0:16,53 --> 0:0:17,351

10

JUSTIN REMER: In 2007, I saw Joe
playing at his stop at the


11
0:0:33,8 --> 0:0:39,33
Metropolitan G train stop, and
he pretty much said to me, in


12
0:0:39,33 --> 0:0:40,58
not so many words, that
he was homeless.


13
0:0:40,58 --> 0:0:45,47



14
0:0:45,47 --> 0:0:48,85
JOE CROW RYAN: A lot of the
songs I sing don't come from


15
0:0:48,85 --> 0:0:51,35
me personally.


16
0:0:51,35 --> 0:0:54,34
They're characters who
are singing the song.


17
0:0:54,34 --> 0:0:58,72
But it comes from my
understanding of truth.


18
0:0:58,72 --> 0:1:1,46



19
0:1:1,46 --> 0:1:4,22
JUSTIN REMER: He's doing
something that's so totally


20
0:1:4,22 --> 0:1:8,42
his own that it catches
your attention.


21
0:1:8,42 --> 0:1:11,41
JOE CROW RYAN: And I always
thought that somehow, poverty


22
0:1:11,41 --> 0:1:12,62
was a virtue.


23
0:1:12,62 --> 0:1:15,47
So being in a level of
performance that's not


24
0:1:15,47 --> 0:1:19,1
particularly remunerative,
I do make barely


25
0:1:19,1 --> 0:1:19,97
enough to get by.


26
0:1:19,97 --> 0:1:22,571
But that somehow suits
my temperament.


27
0:1:22,571 --> 0:1:27,93



28
0:1:27,93 --> 0:1:31,15
If there is a will of God, if
there is a "supposed to be,"


29
0:1:31,15 --> 0:1:33,896
what you're doing right now,
what I'm doing right now is


30

what I'm supposed to be doing.

Hi, I'm Joe Crow Ryan.


38
0:2:12,68 --> 0:2:16,74
I'm a busker in New York City,
and a performer in general.

41
0:2:21,54 --> 0:2:24,28
NARRATOR: Joe Crow Ryan, born
Joseph W. Ryan, came into this


42
0:2:24,28 --> 0:2:27,1
world on August 6th, 1955.


43
0:2:27,1 --> 0:2:29,55
He hails from 183rd Street
in the Bronx.


44
0:2:29,55 --> 0:2:33,5
JOE CROW RYAN: My mom
died when I was 13.


45
0:2:33,5 --> 0:2:36,84
And when I was 15, we moved
to Rockland County.


46
0:2:36,84 --> 0:2:43,51
I started playing guitar a
little bit and totally sucked.


47
0:2:43,51 --> 0:2:45,96
Then I got another guitar while
I was in high school,


48
0:2:45,96 --> 0:2:47,85
and I wrote my first song.


49
0:2:47,85 --> 0:2:50,2
I wrote a love song for my
girlfriend, and she begged me,


50
0:2:50,2 --> 0:2:53,39
please don't play that
in front of people.


51
0:2:53,39 --> 0:2:56,0
Not because it was a horrible
song, but because I didn't


52
0:2:56,0 --> 0:2:59,98
realize I was just inept
and inadequate as a


53
0:2:59,98 --> 0:3:1,23
performer at the time.


54
0:3:1,23 --> 0:3:6,79



55
0:3:6,79 --> 0:3:11,1
But guitar, I played it a little
bit for a long enough


56
0:3:11,1 --> 0:3:15,14
time that I eventually
became competent.


57
0:3:15,14 --> 0:3:19,45
Yeah, I'd always like the
odd-ball performers because


58
0:3:19,45 --> 0:3:21,15
nobody else really
cared for them.


59
0:3:21,15 --> 0:3:22,77
They were weird.


60
0:3:22,77 --> 0:3:25,32
And I liked it a lot and tried
to get my friends to listen,


61
0:3:25,32 --> 0:3:27,381
and nobody was really
impressed with that.


62
0:3:27,381 --> 0:3:30,54



63
0:3:30,54 --> 0:3:35,68
But, I guess it formed
me as being a


64
0:3:35,68 --> 0:3:36,93
different kind of musician.


65
0:3:36,93 --> 0:3:39,27



66
0:3:39,27 --> 0:3:41,32
JOE CROW RYAN: Oh, my gosh.


67
0:3:41,32 --> 0:3:43,35
Jobs in my life.


68
0:3:43,35 --> 0:3:46,35
Well, my first real
job was before we


69
0:3:46,35 --> 0:3:47,46
moved out of the Bronx.


70
0:3:47,46 --> 0:3:50,41
I was a delivery boy
for a drug store.


71
0:3:50,41 --> 0:3:55,55
I worked at about four Friendly
Ice Cream stores.


72
0:3:55,55 --> 0:4:0,86
And I've worked in a couple of
nursing homes and a good


73
0:4:0,86 --> 0:4:4,39
handful of hospitals as
a nurse assistant.


74
0:4:4,39 --> 0:4:8,51
Well, I liked working in the
hospital because it was a nice


75
0:4:8,51 --> 0:4:10,21
thing to do for people.


76
0:4:10,21 --> 0:4:11,45
They needed help.


77
0:4:11,45 --> 0:4:14,66
Again, it's, you know, person
to person, and it's


78
0:4:14,66 --> 0:4:16,76
also kind of macho.


79
0:4:16,76 --> 0:4:20,339
Like I don't think that Arnold
Schwarzenegger has ever wiped


80
0:4:20,339 --> 0:4:22,66
poop off anybody's butt.


81
0:4:22,66 --> 0:4:25,15
I don't think he's ever cleaned
a homeless lady in an


82
0:4:25,15 --> 0:4:27,32
emergency room.


83
0:4:27,32 --> 0:4:31,6
I'd worked there for about four
years, this North Shore


84
0:4:31,6 --> 0:4:33,47
University Hospital.


85
0:4:33,47 --> 0:4:38,33
And then, they came to us one
day and said, we're going to


86
0:4:38,33 --> 0:4:42,52
have a new personnel program
called re-engineering.


87
0:4:42,52 --> 0:4:45,49
What I heard was
re-engineering.


88
0:4:45,49 --> 0:4:48,23
The first thought was, I'm
not a machine, OK.


89
0:4:48,23 --> 0:4:51,17
And then I noticed that even
though the insurance companies


90
0:4:51,17 --> 0:4:54,52
weren't paying for the day
before surgery and


91
0:4:54,52 --> 0:4:59,1
establishing the healing milieu,
they would pay for end


92
0:4:59,1 --> 0:5:1,33
of life extension.


93
0:5:1,33 --> 0:5:3,74
So I noticed this,
and I mentioned


94
0:5:3,74 --> 0:5:4,68
it to the head nurse.


95
0:5:4,68 --> 0:5:11,74
I said, you know, 26 to 32 are
all people who should be dead.


96
0:5:11,74 --> 0:5:13,59
You know, it's their time.


97
0:5:13,59 --> 0:5:16,4
That just is weird, isn't it?


98
0:5:16,4 --> 0:5:17,12
It's not right.


99
0:5:17,12 --> 0:5:20,47
She said, well, yeah,
it's kind of--


100
0:5:20,47 --> 0:5:22,11
that is funny.


101
0:5:22,11 --> 0:5:25,75
But then the next day, the head
nurse of all head nurses


102
0:5:25,75 --> 0:5:28,76
in the hospital called me to
her office and in essence


103
0:5:28,76 --> 0:5:32,49
said, well, maybe you should
take a month off.


104
0:5:32,49 --> 0:5:35,75
So I let that pass, and I talked
with the psychiatric


105
0:5:35,75 --> 0:5:38,47
nurse, and she wanted to
prescribe medicine for me


106
0:5:38,47 --> 0:5:39,79
right away.


107
0:5:39,79 --> 0:5:42,32
I said, I don't need medicine.


108
0:5:42,32 --> 0:5:43,48
Let's talk.


109
0:5:43,48 --> 0:5:47,61
So we got into the idea of
stages of life, end stage of


110
0:5:47,61 --> 0:5:52,25
life, and also got into the
idea of re-engineering.


111
0:5:52,25 --> 0:5:55,27
Because that did bother me, and
I explained to her that


112
0:5:55,27 --> 0:5:56,55
I'm not a machine.


113
0:5:56,55 --> 0:5:57,84
I'm a human.


114
0:5:57,84 --> 0:6:1,31
And she said, but it's
just a word.


115
0:6:1,31 --> 0:6:4,53
And I said, but it
means something.


116
0:6:4,53 --> 0:6:6,17
And then I asked her,
I said, have you


117
0:6:6,17 --> 0:6:8,47
ever read Kurt Vonnegut?


118
0:6:8,47 --> 0:6:11,38
And she said, no, what does that
have to do with anything?


119
0:6:11,38 --> 0:6:13,732
And I said, you know--


120
0:6:13,732 --> 0:6:15,53
I'm done with jobs.


121
0:6:15,53 --> 0:6:17,75
Jobs are done with me.


122
0:6:17,75 --> 0:6:19,7
Who would hire me?


123
0:6:19,7 --> 0:6:21,35
If somebody wanted to hire me,
they could come over to me and


124
0:6:21,35 --> 0:6:23,96
tell me, "Joe Crow, I would
like to hire you." I'm not


125
0:6:23,96 --> 0:6:27,58
gonna go out to a stranger and
say, "Hi, I'm pretending to be


126
0:6:27,58 --> 0:6:29,79
somebody who you'd like to
hire, and I'm pretending


127
0:6:29,79 --> 0:6:33,91
you're somebody I would like to
work for." That's not it.


128
0:6:33,91 --> 0:6:37,27
It works out because otherwise,
I'd be a nurse.


129
0:6:37,27 --> 0:6:40,8
But the outcome of
this experience


130
0:6:40,8 --> 0:6:42,705
was, I became homeless.


131
0:6:42,705 --> 0:6:46,8
NARRATOR: From April to
September of 2007, Joe was


132
0:6:46,8 --> 0:6:48,63

Prospect Park and the

136

JUSTIN REMER: In 2007, I saw Joe
playing at his stop at the

0:7:12,94 --> 0:7:15,47
Metropolitan G train stop.


138
0:7:15,47 --> 0:7:21,19
And I was talking to him, and he
pretty much said to me, in


139
0:7:21,19 --> 0:7:23,63
not so many words, that
he was homeless.


140
0:7:23,63 --> 0:7:26,9
The apartment that he'd been
living in, he couldn't afford


141
0:7:26,9 --> 0:7:28,66
to stay in anymore, so he didn't
have anywhere to go.


142
0:7:28,66 --> 0:7:31,75
JOE CROW RYAN: And Justin was
there one night, and I asked


143
0:7:31,75 --> 0:7:33,3
if he had a couch.


144
0:7:33,3 --> 0:7:35,24
JUSTIN REMER: I decided to give
him a couch to crash on


145
0:7:35,24 --> 0:7:36,64
for a time.


146
0:7:36,64 --> 0:7:39,28
And the place that he had been
working with, he had had a


147
0:7:39,28 --> 0:7:43,97
conflict with them, and
basically, it ended in a


148
0:7:43,97 --> 0:7:48,23
pay-off, which wound up being
enough for him to actually pay


149
0:7:48,23 --> 0:7:51,68
rent at my apartment
for five months.


150
0:7:51,68 --> 0:7:53,93

moved out right at that time,


151

so Joe moved in.

since then.

in the movie theater.

And we also started recording
his shows at the sidewalk.

up, and the CDs are a mixture

I am Joe Crow Ryan,
I should mention.


208
0:11:5,32 --> 0:11:6,96
I'm Joe Crow Ryan.

0:11:6,96 --> 0:11:10,13
Tonight's Sunday busk is in
celebration of the release of

0:11:10,13 --> 0:11:13,61

And I have free download
slips for that.


212
0:11:18,0 --> 0:11:21,35
If you'd like to hear the
song, "My Arrest."


213
0:11:21,35 --> 0:11:23,9
It might be a little while yet
to the next train, so I'll


214
0:11:23,9 --> 0:11:28,16
proceed to play "My Arrest."
We'll take


215
0:11:28,16 --> 0:11:30,99
questions after the song.


216
0:11:30,99 --> 0:11:34,42
Whether there are questions
or not, we'll take them.


217
0:11:34,42 --> 0:11:38,94
JUSTIN REMER: So, the day before
May Day, we had about


218
0:11:38,94 --> 0:11:41,55
bunch of cops bust
down our door.


219
0:11:41,55 --> 0:11:45,57
JOE CROW RYAN: About five or
six plainclothes warrant


220
0:11:45,57 --> 0:11:48,34
detectives came into our
apartment and woke us up.


221
0:11:48,34 --> 0:11:49,97
JUSTIN REMER: Like they
didn't ask to come in.


222
0:11:49,97 --> 0:11:50,54
We were asleep.


223
0:11:50,54 --> 0:11:52,13
It was like 6:00
in the morning.


224
0:11:52,13 --> 0:11:53,835
They bust down our door.


225
0:11:53,835 --> 0:11:57,43
JOE CROW RYAN: I think these
guys were all intelligence,


226
0:11:57,43 --> 0:12:1,51
NYPD intelligence assigned to
warrants for this maneuver.


227
0:12:1,51 --> 0:12:2,95
JUSTIN REMER: They rouse
us all out of bed.


228
0:12:2,95 --> 0:12:5,38
They round us up in the living
room, and then they start


229
0:12:5,38 --> 0:12:7,34
reading through warrants,
and then they're like,


230
0:12:7,34 --> 0:12:8,92
is Joseph Ryan here?


231
0:12:8,92 --> 0:12:11,16
And then he's like,
I'm Joseph Ryan.


232
0:12:11,16 --> 0:12:13,735
And they're like, OK, well
we're here for you.


233
0:12:13,735 --> 0:12:15,7
JOE CROW RYAN: I said,
well look, I knew--


234
0:12:15,7 --> 0:12:18,66
I thought I was going
to be going to


235
0:12:18,66 --> 0:12:20,91
Schermerhorn Jail for 24 hours.


236
0:12:20,91 --> 0:12:22,28
That's what I thought
was gonna happen.


237
0:12:22,28 --> 0:12:25,51
And they put me in handcuffs,
got me into the car.


238
0:12:25,51 --> 0:12:27,65
And the first thing they started
asking was about my


239
0:12:27,65 --> 0:12:28,725
roommate Zach.


240
0:12:28,725 --> 0:12:31,84
So he said, well, is he doing
anything for May Day?


241
0:12:31,84 --> 0:12:33,79
I said, I don't think so.


242
0:12:33,79 --> 0:12:35,72
They said, well isn't he
one of those Occupieds?


243
0:12:35,72 --> 0:12:38,24
Isn't he gonna be at
an Occupy event?


244
0:12:38,24 --> 0:12:41,82
I said, no, Zach is not in
Occupy, which he's not.


245
0:12:41,82 --> 0:12:45,506
It turns out, he doesn't even
like Occupy on Facebook.


246
0:12:45,506 --> 0:12:47,4
JUSTIN REMER: And then,
meanwhile, they took my


247
0:12:47,4 --> 0:12:50,32
roommate off to another room,
the one who'd been arrested


248
0:12:50,32 --> 0:12:53,77
before, to interrogate
him about May Day.


249
0:12:53,77 --> 0:12:56,5
So that was why they
were there.


250
0:12:56,5 --> 0:13:1,41
But the reason they claim they
were there was for this


251
0:13:1,41 --> 0:13:3,89
five-year-old open
beer ticket.


252
0:13:3,89 --> 0:13:9,4
JOE CROW RYAN: Like I had drunk
beer outside in 2007,


253
0:13:9,4 --> 0:13:15,73
and I stopped drinking in
September 28th, 2007.


254
0:13:15,73 --> 0:13:18,32
And I haven't drunk
alcohol since.


255
0:13:18,32 --> 0:13:21,125
Thank you.


256
0:13:21,125 --> 0:13:23,12
JUSTIN REMER: And that's the
thing, is that when Joe moved


257
0:13:23,12 --> 0:13:25,77
into my apartment,
he gave up booze.


258
0:13:25,77 --> 0:13:28,77
And he's actually stayed sober
without a program, which is


259
0:13:28,77 --> 0:13:30,735
kind of an achievement.


260
0:13:30,735 --> 0:13:36,16
JOE CROW RYAN: So, Ray Kelly had
no idea I was, A, alive,


261
0:13:36,16 --> 0:13:39,99
B, living here.

0:13:39,99 --> 0:13:43,67
If I had $50 to pay for
the summonses--

didn't matter to him,
all he wanted--


264

and I'll tell you, this
Ray Kelly, and you

0:13:48,6 --> 0:13:49,58
tell me if I'm wrong.
