1
0:0:1,36 --> 0:0:5,4
Anyone watching thinking we know
fuck all about knowing fuck all


2
0:0:5,4 --> 0:0:8,12
about owt, needs to watch
their back...


3
0:0:8,12 --> 0:0:11,32
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,


4
0:0:11,32 --> 0:0:13,0
sending prices sky-high,


5
0:0:13,0 --> 0:0:17,64
literally, literally taking
the grass from its own roots!


6
0:0:17,64 --> 0:0:19,721
And now you've got
your ConDemNation,


7
0:0:19,721 --> 0:0:23,12
Liberals noshing Tories like
altar boys picking dimps up!


8
0:0:23,12 --> 0:0:27,88
Have we had a national
fucking stroke... or what?


9
0:0:27,88 --> 0:0:31,28
Is revolution a word
or was it never?


10
0:0:31,28 --> 0:0:34,8
Anybody watching, needs to know,
we cope better than average


11
0:0:34,8 --> 0:0:36,84
with irony in Chatsworth.


12
0:0:36,84 --> 0:0:41,88
Well, for fuck's sake, we live
in Manchester and they charge us


13
0:0:41,88 --> 0:0:43,84
for water!


14
0:0:43,84 --> 0:0:48,2
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found...


15
0:0:48,2 --> 0:0:51,4
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...


16
0:0:51,4 --> 0:0:53,96
Yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak, yak!


17
0:0:53,96 --> 0:0:57,24
It's not theirs any more.


18
0:0:57,24 --> 0:0:59,72
This is our England now!


19
0:0:59,72 --> 0:1:2,28
Paaaarty!


20
0:1:2,28 --> 0:1:10,4
Contains strong language, scenes of
a sexual nature and some violence.


21
0:1:10,4 --> 0:1:14,56
The first throes of love
are all about passion.


22
0:1:14,56 --> 0:1:18,36
Eyes, hands, lips, limbs, kisses,


23
0:1:18,36 --> 0:1:22,72
I love yous and promises
of never-ending devotion.


24
0:1:22,72 --> 0:1:27,88
Burning to memory every nook
and cranny of that face,


25
0:1:27,88 --> 0:1:31,48
that body, drowning in each other,
getting your fill,


26
0:1:31,48 --> 0:1:33,92
getting more than your fill,
that thirst


27
0:1:33,92 --> 0:1:37,28
you can never really quench,
no matter how much you try.


28
0:1:37,28 --> 0:1:40,76
And fuck knows we try, don't we?


29
0:1:40,76 --> 0:1:44,48
'I read in some mag,
in a waiting room years back, that...


30
0:1:44,48 --> 0:1:48,12
'if you put a coin in a jar every
time you made love in the first


31
0:1:48,12 --> 0:1:51,4
'three years of your relationship,
then took one out every time


32
0:1:51,4 --> 0:1:53,88
'you did it after three years... '


33
0:1:53,88 --> 0:1:55,52
Yeah, yeah!


34
0:1:55,52 --> 0:1:58,8
'..you'd never ever, ever, ever... '


35
0:1:58,8 --> 0:2:0,36
Yeah, yeah!


36
0:2:0,36 --> 0:2:1,561
'..be able to empty it.'


37
0:2:1,561 --> 0:2:22,92
Oh!


38
0:2:22,92 --> 0:2:25,12
Cum again and soon.


39
0:2:25,12 --> 0:2:27,52
Not too soon though, eh, Tiger?


40
0:2:27,52 --> 0:2:33,8
Give me some time to recover.


41
0:2:33,8 --> 0:2:34,72
Dickhead.


42
0:2:34,72 --> 0:2:35,159
He's tipped you?


43
0:2:35,159 --> 0:2:36,279
He thinks he made me cum.


44
0:2:36,279 --> 0:2:37,961
Screams were almost convincing.


45
0:2:37,961 --> 0:2:39,64
The yelps helped.


46
0:2:39,64 --> 0:2:41,76
I had cramp. Came in handy.


47
0:2:41,76 --> 0:2:43,81
I can spot a fake a mile off.


48
0:2:43,81 --> 0:2:45,4
Well, I guess you've pulled
a few in your time.


49
0:2:45,4 --> 0:2:47,2
Didn't need to.


50
0:2:47,2 --> 0:2:49,359
My Brendan were gifted
in the trouser department.


51
0:2:49,359 --> 0:2:53,8
When he stripped off
put me in mind of a tripod.


52
0:2:53,8 --> 0:2:55,601
Any chance of you finishing early?


53
0:2:55,601 --> 0:2:58,48
We've got a stag do in any minute
now. I'd leave the girls to it


54
0:2:58,48 --> 0:3:0,64
but we need all hands on deck
for this one.


55
0:3:0,64 --> 0:3:3,84
Lillian just took a call
and the lads've been chewing Viagra


56
0:3:3,84 --> 0:3:5,4
since they left Burnley.


57
0:3:5,4 --> 0:3:8,8
They won't walk in,
they'll be pole vaulting.


58
0:3:8,8 --> 0:3:12,28
No worries. I'll catch
you later then, OK?


59
0:3:12,28 --> 0:3:14,76
He knows... that you're lying.


60
0:3:14,76 --> 0:3:17,52
Orgasms aren't the only thing
I'm good at faking.


61
0:3:17,52 --> 0:3:20,52
He hasn't got a clue.


62
0:3:20,52 --> 0:3:21,921
Don't know what's wrong
with her lately.


63
0:3:21,921 --> 0:3:28,72
I do.


64
0:3:28,72 --> 0:3:29,879
It's too small.


65
0:3:29,879 --> 0:3:31,801
It'll keep the wind off your back.


66
0:3:31,801 --> 0:3:35,76
Yeah and give me twatting frostbite
at the front.


67
0:3:35,76 --> 0:3:38,64
I'll look like a fucking nutter.


68
0:3:38,64 --> 0:3:39,961
But you are a fucking nutter.


69
0:3:39,961 --> 0:3:41,8
Take no notice.


70
0:3:41,8 --> 0:3:44,4
Beggars can't be choosers.


71
0:3:44,4 --> 0:3:47,0
As soon as you get a few bob
rolling in, it's me and you


72
0:3:47,0 --> 0:3:49,68
straight down to Primani
for a proper makeover.


73
0:3:49,68 --> 0:3:51,681
But until then,
it's our Shane's cast-offs.


74
0:3:51,681 --> 0:3:52,84
It suits you.


75
0:3:52,84 --> 0:3:54,52
Yeah, it looks... nice.


76
0:3:54,52 --> 0:3:56,481
It's pink and it smells of perfume.


77
0:3:56,481 --> 0:3:59,24
Only real men can wear pink.
And it's aftershave that.


78
0:3:59,24 --> 0:4:1,92
This is a bird's fluffy jumper.


79
0:4:1,92 --> 0:4:3,679
Angora. He's allergic to manmade.


80
0:4:3,679 --> 0:4:5,41
It's got tit shapes in it.


81
0:4:5,41 --> 0:4:7,8
Must've been me mam's.


82
0:4:7,8 --> 0:4:16,0
You need to try it on.


83
0:4:16,0 --> 0:4:18,68
You look lovely.


84
0:4:18,68 --> 0:4:21,28
None of it fits! Right?


85
0:4:21,28 --> 0:4:22,88
I can't survive much longer


86
0:4:22,88 --> 0:4:25,8
on two pairs of socks, three
T-shirts and a pair of undies.


87
0:4:25,8 --> 0:4:28,4
Just one pair?


88
0:4:28,4 --> 0:4:31,12
Oh, I wish I'd known that sooner.


89
0:4:31,12 --> 0:4:34,4
I'm only on a tea break.


90
0:4:34,4 --> 0:4:38,2
Laters.


91
0:4:38,2 --> 0:4:41,44
Look, just go commando
whilst they wash and dry.


92
0:4:41,44 --> 0:4:42,801
Eh... ready for action.


93
0:4:42,801 --> 0:4:44,52
Homo! Sorry.


94
0:4:44,52 --> 0:4:52,12
I can't, I'll chafe.


95
0:4:52,12 --> 0:5:0,24
It was only going go on a bottle
of baby oil and some poppers.


96
0:5:0,24 --> 0:5:1,841
You've been a pal to me, Micky.


97
0:5:1,841 --> 0:5:4,4
And if I were queer,
I'd bum you here and now.


98
0:5:4,4 --> 0:5:7,64
Thanks, Marty.


99
0:5:7,64 --> 0:5:11,2
You're going to make someone
a lovely wife... partner one day.


100
0:5:11,2 --> 0:5:13,681
But I've got to stand up
on my own two feet.


101
0:5:13,681 --> 0:5:17,64
I need cash,
so I'll have to do a job.


102
0:5:17,64 --> 0:5:22,28
Get a job.


103
0:5:22,28 --> 0:5:25,16
Everybody get down!


104
0:5:25,16 --> 0:5:26,84
Shut up. Shut your...


105
0:5:26,84 --> 0:5:28,279
This is a fuck up!


106
0:5:28,279 --> 0:5:30,241
Shut the fuck up...
this is a stick up!


107
0:5:30,241 --> 0:5:33,6
Rectal prolapse!


108
0:5:33,6 --> 0:5:39,72
Gimme the money, gimme the money!


109
0:5:39,72 --> 0:5:41,4
Evil...!


110
0:5:41,4 --> 0:5:46,56
Fuck off!


111
0:5:46,56 --> 0:5:49,16
Sit down, wait till you see this.
It's class!


112
0:5:49,16 --> 0:5:53,52
Come on, you're in my seat.


113
0:5:53,52 --> 0:6:3,16
Soon have you smiling again, girl!


114
0:6:3,16 --> 0:6:5,8
Isn't that the shittest...


115
0:6:5,8 --> 0:6:8,44
crappest robber
you have ever seen?


116
0:6:8,44 --> 0:6:10,36
How much did he get away with?


117
0:6:10,36 --> 0:6:12,92
Enough for some chips and a taxi
home!


118
0:6:12,92 --> 0:6:26,4
Fucking shame of it!


119
0:6:26,4 --> 0:6:30,0
You know who that was?


120
0:6:30,0 --> 0:6:31,68
You know.


121
0:6:31,68 --> 0:6:33,16
I don't know.


122
0:6:33,16 --> 0:6:36,44
So... why don't you tell me?


123
0:6:36,44 --> 0:6:37,321
Marty.


124
0:6:37,321 --> 0:6:38,8
How'd you know?


125
0:6:38,8 --> 0:6:40,121
He was wearing my old coat.


126
0:6:40,121 --> 0:6:42,8
Not his style, is it?
Armed robbery, not the coat.


127
0:6:42,8 --> 0:6:44,68
I don't his fucking style.


128
0:6:44,68 --> 0:6:47,8
It's only a matter of time before
the filth get their shit together


129
0:6:47,8 --> 0:6:50,28
and clock it's him.


130
0:6:50,28 --> 0:6:52,44
And? Arrest him.


131
0:6:52,44 --> 0:6:53,481
You're not arsed?


132
0:6:53,481 --> 0:6:55,32
He's a punter, Shane.


133
0:6:55,32 --> 0:6:58,92
Offering ten-grand reward
for somebody to grass him up.


134
0:6:58,92 --> 0:7:1,6
If he's daft enough to threaten
people with a gun,


135
0:7:1,6 --> 0:7:3,4
he deserves grassing up.


136
0:7:3,4 --> 0:7:4,841
It's deposit on a house that,
you know, ten grand.


137
0:7:4,841 --> 0:7:12,48
Maguires don't grass.


138
0:7:12,48 --> 0:7:14,6
Fucking stupid though, weren't it?


139
0:7:14,6 --> 0:7:17,36
He is fucking stupid.


140
0:7:17,36 --> 0:7:19,32
Aren't you?!


141
0:7:19,32 --> 0:7:20,72
I said aren't you!?


142
0:7:20,72 --> 0:7:23,4
What the fuck was I supposed to do?


143
0:7:23,4 --> 0:7:25,68
I'm here, skint, I can't work,
I can't sign on.


144
0:7:25,68 --> 0:7:27,72
What, in case the police catch you


145
0:7:27,72 --> 0:7:30,4
for non-payment of maintenance,
you mean?


146
0:7:30,4 --> 0:7:34,0
As opposed to armed fucking robbery,
you gormless twat!


147
0:7:34,0 --> 0:7:35,441
I needed money!


148
0:7:35,441 --> 0:7:37,0
Then ask!


149
0:7:37,0 --> 0:7:40,8
Don't go holding up Post Offices
with fucking guns!


150
0:7:40,8 --> 0:7:42,48
You could've killed someone,


151
0:7:42,48 --> 0:7:45,28
some poor bastard
collecting their pension.


152
0:7:45,28 --> 0:7:52,76
You could've got killed yourself
and then what would I have done?!


153
0:7:52,76 --> 0:7:55,4
I mean, how would I have explained
that to Sue?


154
0:7:55,4 --> 0:7:59,8
Where'd you get the gun?


155
0:7:59,8 --> 0:8:2,8
They're stashed here! It's family
stuff, you know the score, Kel!


156
0:8:2,8 --> 0:8:6,52
You keep him away from guns, you got
that? Guns and fucking matches!


157
0:8:6,52 --> 0:8:7,92
Sorry!


158
0:8:7,92 --> 0:8:10,52
It could bring a load
of trouble and...


159
0:8:10,52 --> 0:8:13,0
We've had enough... That... that gun,


160
0:8:13,0 --> 0:8:29,44
could be linked to Shane,
maybe and they'll...


161
0:8:29,44 --> 0:8:32,84
You're looking lovely.


162
0:8:32,84 --> 0:8:35,68
You do, you look dead nice, like.
Nice.


163
0:8:35,68 --> 0:8:38,16
Proper like... glowing,


164
0:8:38,16 --> 0:8:40,68
healthily.


165
0:8:40,68 --> 0:8:43,24
I was thinking... do you want me
to make tea tonight?


166
0:8:43,24 --> 0:8:44,239
What's going on?


167
0:8:44,239 --> 0:8:46,201
Why would anything be going on?


168
0:8:46,201 --> 0:8:48,84
I was married longer
than you've been alive.


169
0:8:48,84 --> 0:8:51,92
And I know that when a man's
buttering you up


170
0:8:51,92 --> 0:8:54,4
with a string of compliments,
he's about to do


171
0:8:54,4 --> 0:8:56,52
one of two things -
confess or request.


172
0:8:56,52 --> 0:8:58,32
Which is it?


173
0:8:58,32 --> 0:8:59,441
Er...


174
0:8:59,441 --> 0:9:2,96
Don't lie! If you've got
something to say, say it.


175
0:9:2,96 --> 0:9:4,361
I've just...


176
0:9:4,361 --> 0:9:5,68
Speak!


177
0:9:5,68 --> 0:9:9,6
Well, now it's out in the open,
who Cilla's dad is,


178
0:9:9,6 --> 0:9:11,641
I was thinking if like...
if we could...


179
0:9:11,641 --> 0:9:15,8
well, when she's Christened,
if we could give her a second name?


180
0:9:15,8 --> 0:9:17,281
You know, cos her mam
gave her her first name,


181
0:9:17,281 --> 0:9:19,281
her dad can give her her second.


182
0:9:19,281 --> 0:9:21,28
What were you thinking of?


183
0:9:21,28 --> 0:9:21,919
Maureen.


184
0:9:21,919 --> 0:9:22,679
Fuck off.


185
0:9:22,679 --> 0:9:23,761
What, it's me mam's name.


186
0:9:23,761 --> 0:9:25,52
She can keep it.


187
0:9:25,52 --> 0:9:28,36
It's not fair, Mimi.
You get to do everything


188
0:9:28,36 --> 0:9:30,721
and I just get shit on by you,
Shane, Jamie and Micky.


189
0:9:30,721 --> 0:9:31,96
OK.


190
0:9:31,96 --> 0:9:34,161
Always taking the piss out of...
out of me.


191
0:9:34,161 --> 0:9:38,16
Did you just say OK then?


192
0:9:38,16 --> 0:9:40,8
On one condition.


193
0:9:40,8 --> 0:9:43,52
That you convert,
come over to our side.


194
0:9:43,52 --> 0:9:46,52
You mean support Liverpool?


195
0:9:46,52 --> 0:9:49,68
I mean become a Catholic,
you knobhead.


196
0:9:49,68 --> 0:10:4,84
Oh... oh, right. Yeah, yeah.


197
0:10:4,84 --> 0:10:9,8
You've been named, Marty boy.
Armed robber at the Post Office.


198
0:10:9,8 --> 0:10:12,24
Cuddly little Marty
with his funny little ways.


199
0:10:12,24 --> 0:10:14,6
Wouldn't harm a fly, eh?


200
0:10:14,6 --> 0:10:16,1
F... f... fuck off.


201
0:10:16,1 --> 0:10:19,16
Terrify a gang of pensioners half to
death in a Post Office queue, yes,


202
0:10:19,16 --> 0:10:20,361
but wouldn't harm a fly.


203
0:10:20,361 --> 0:10:21,88
Fuck off, Shane.


204
0:10:21,88 --> 0:10:23,56
Come on, I'm fucking with you.


205
0:10:23,56 --> 0:10:26,76
You know what, I've been doing
a bit of research, mate.


206
0:10:26,76 --> 0:10:31,4
All you have to do is type in
'Arson' and 'Fuengerola'


207
0:10:31,4 --> 0:10:36,84
and it's fucking amazing
what pops up.


208
0:10:36,84 --> 0:10:39,88
You know, it's funny you never
mentioned that your wife and kids


209
0:10:39,88 --> 0:10:42,28
died in a house fire.


210
0:10:42,28 --> 0:10:45,56
Anyone'd think you had
something to hide, mate.


211
0:10:45,56 --> 0:10:48,6
Save your breath, Marty,
you're going to need it.


212
0:10:48,6 --> 0:10:50,12
I just called the filth.


213
0:10:50,12 --> 0:10:52,4
I've told them where you were.


214
0:10:52,4 --> 0:10:53,64
SIREN


215
0:10:53,64 --> 0:10:57,8
Run.


216
0:10:57,8 --> 0:11:15,8
Run!


217
0:11:15,8 --> 0:11:19,48
I've got a few more
cast-offs for Marty...


218
0:11:19,48 --> 0:11:23,88
I was dr... dragged
out of bed last night


219
0:11:23,88 --> 0:11:26,28
by an armed copper


220
0:11:26,28 --> 0:11:28,84
with his gun shoved half-way
up my fucking nostril!


221
0:11:28,84 --> 0:11:29,761
What, family stuff?


222
0:11:29,761 --> 0:11:31,84
They were asking me where Marty was.


223
0:11:31,84 --> 0:11:35,96
I said, "I don't know",
and spent the next...


224
0:11:35,96 --> 0:11:40,52
nine hours helping the police
with their enquiries.


225
0:11:40,52 --> 0:11:43,96
Someone must've grassed.


226
0:11:43,96 --> 0:11:46,8
That'd be me.


227
0:11:46,8 --> 0:11:49,8
And since when did you develop
a conscience?


228
0:11:49,8 --> 0:11:54,44
When I found out Marty's wife
and kids died in an arson attack.


229
0:11:54,44 --> 0:11:58,96
Spate of fires across Fuengerola.
Culprit never found.


230
0:11:58,96 --> 0:12:1,44
But you got a fucking nutter
out there


231
0:12:1,44 --> 0:12:6,24
with a history of that sort of stuff
and, well, one and one... is two.


232
0:12:6,24 --> 0:12:7,399
He killed them?


233
0:12:7,399 --> 0:12:10,0
Yep. Seems that way.


234
0:12:10,0 --> 0:12:12,16
I was thinking of a trip into town.


235
0:12:12,16 --> 0:12:15,52
Get you some new gear,
something to eat, eh?


236
0:12:15,52 --> 0:12:19,88
That ten grand you got for grassing
him up burning a hole in your pocket?


237
0:12:19,88 --> 0:12:22,88
It were anonymous.


238
0:12:22,88 --> 0:12:25,4
I'm booked solid all morning.


239
0:12:25,4 --> 0:12:26,92
Who wants a fuck at this hour?


240
0:12:26,92 --> 0:12:32,8
You... Once upon a time.


241
0:12:32,8 --> 0:12:36,68
The thing is, I don't know anything
about God or religion, Father.


242
0:12:36,68 --> 0:12:40,12
He's C of E. Is he allowed
to change sides, Father?


243
0:12:40,12 --> 0:12:43,6
We don't really think of it
as sides, now, do we, Mimi?


244
0:12:43,6 --> 0:12:46,56
It'll be a lot of hard work
on your part, Billy.


245
0:12:46,56 --> 0:12:49,88
You'll have to research the faith,
attend classes.


246
0:12:49,88 --> 0:12:52,199
He's not afraid
of a bit of hard work.


247
0:12:52,199 --> 0:12:53,641
It's for my daughter.


248
0:12:53,641 --> 0:12:54,96
And for you, too.


249
0:12:54,96 --> 0:12:56,921
Front of the queue
at the Pearly Gates


250
0:12:56,921 --> 0:12:59,92
if you're a Catholic, eh, Father?


251
0:12:59,92 --> 0:13:2,84
We'll keep it informal
for the time being.


252
0:13:2,84 --> 0:13:3,879
Yeah.


253
0:13:3,879 --> 0:13:6,281
Look forward to getting to know you
as well as the rest of the family.


254
0:13:6,281 --> 0:13:9,8
Lovely seeing you, Father.


255
0:13:9,8 --> 0:13:9,841
And you, Mimi.


256
0:13:9,841 --> 0:13:11,28
Take care.


257
0:13:11,28 --> 0:13:12,8
I will.


258
0:13:12,8 --> 0:13:13,68
See ya.


259
0:13:13,68 --> 0:13:15,16
Micky. Father.


260
0:13:15,16 --> 0:13:19,68
Bye now!


261
0:13:19,68 --> 0:13:21,719
What's he doing here?
Has someone died?


262
0:13:21,719 --> 0:13:23,121
Billy's going to be a Catholic.


263
0:13:23,121 --> 0:13:25,2
What the fuck for? It's shit!


264
0:13:25,2 --> 0:13:28,68
Thou shall not do this,
that and the other. And the guilt.


265
0:13:28,68 --> 0:13:31,48
Takes you about a week
to get over spilling your seed.


266
0:13:31,48 --> 0:13:34,0
Stay Proddy, man, much more fun.


267
0:13:34,0 --> 0:13:35,79
I'm doing it for Cilla.


268
0:13:35,79 --> 0:13:36,599
You're doing it to get in
with me mam.


269
0:13:36,599 --> 0:13:38,399
It's for my daughter, your sister.


270
0:13:38,399 --> 0:13:39,521
She won't thank you.


271
0:13:39,521 --> 0:13:42,8
If I was going to change,
I'd go Muslim.


272
0:13:42,8 --> 0:13:44,8
Food's better and all you've
got to do is grow a beard.


273
0:13:44,8 --> 0:13:46,879
You won't even pass the exams,
you, anyway.


274
0:13:46,879 --> 0:13:48,119
Why's that, then?


275
0:13:48,119 --> 0:13:56,28
Cos you're a thick cunt.


276
0:13:56,28 --> 0:13:57,76
Mam!


277
0:13:57,76 --> 0:13:59,1
Mam!


278
0:13:59,1 --> 0:14:1,48
You, living room, now!


279
0:14:1,48 --> 0:14:3,6
It wasn't me!


280
0:14:3,6 --> 0:14:13,4
Don't have me saying it twice!


281
0:14:13,4 --> 0:14:15,32
No matter how hard I try,


282
0:14:15,32 --> 0:14:18,28
your lads are just going to keep
throwing it back in my face.


283
0:14:18,28 --> 0:14:19,481
Nothing I do'll ever be
good enough for them.


284
0:14:19,481 --> 0:14:24,8
It's a lot for them to take on,
you being here. Going to take time.


285
0:14:24,8 --> 0:14:27,36
You can handle this.
You're a tough lad.


286
0:14:27,36 --> 0:14:30,68
Made of sterner stuff
than they know. Aren't you?


287
0:14:30,68 --> 0:14:31,921
Yeah.


288
0:14:31,921 --> 0:14:45,6
Now, these spuds aren't going to
peel themselves, are they?


289
0:14:45,6 --> 0:14:47,32
Shane's here.


290
0:14:47,32 --> 0:14:49,32
I told you. Tell him I'm occupied.


291
0:14:49,32 --> 0:14:51,56
I did but he said he'd wait.


292
0:14:51,56 --> 0:14:53,441
Look, if you and him's
got a problem, sort it!


293
0:14:53,441 --> 0:14:55,522
Cos punters don't like
looking at a face like


294
0:14:55,522 --> 0:14:58,72
a smacked arse.
They can get that at home.


295
0:14:58,72 --> 0:15:17,24
Give me a minute. Tell him I'm just
tidying, then send him up.


296
0:15:17,24 --> 0:15:20,72
The only time I see anything floral
is weddings, funerals


297
0:15:20,72 --> 0:15:23,76
and when you're trying to keep me
sweet after a fuck-up.


298
0:15:23,76 --> 0:15:24,921
By way of an apology?


299
0:15:24,921 --> 0:15:26,0
A fuck-up.


300
0:15:26,0 --> 0:15:29,4
Yeah. A monumental fuck-up.


301
0:15:29,4 --> 0:15:34,0
You know, I've been that busy,
my mind's been preoccupied


302
0:15:34,0 --> 0:15:36,361
with a million and one
different things,


303
0:15:36,361 --> 0:15:41,4
and I... I've neglected
the one thing that I value most.


304
0:15:41,4 --> 0:15:43,64
I said thing, I don't...


305
0:15:43,64 --> 0:15:45,16
I mean you.


306
0:15:45,16 --> 0:15:51,52
And I'm sorry.


307
0:15:51,52 --> 0:15:54,52
I know you've been
distracted as well.


308
0:15:54,52 --> 0:15:57,6
Hang on a minute...
I don't blame you.


309
0:15:57,6 --> 0:16:5,96
I forced you away.


310
0:16:5,96 --> 0:16:11,52
It takes two to tango... badly.


311
0:16:11,52 --> 0:16:13,2
We are good, us, y'know.


312
0:16:13,2 --> 0:16:14,76
We used to be.


313
0:16:14,76 --> 0:16:19,48
We still are.


314
0:16:19,48 --> 0:16:22,52
Let's make a bit of time.


315
0:16:22,52 --> 0:16:25,56
Get away from here.


316
0:16:25,56 --> 0:16:28,92
I want to be your husband again.


317
0:16:28,92 --> 0:16:30,76
I love you, Kelly Maguire.


318
0:16:30,76 --> 0:16:32,2
Yeah?


319
0:16:32,2 --> 0:16:34,2
Yeah.


320
0:16:34,2 --> 0:16:36,4
Yeah?


321
0:16:36,4 --> 0:16:41,16
Yes.


322
0:16:41,16 --> 0:16:42,6
Yeah?


323
0:16:42,6 --> 0:16:54,84
Yes!


324
0:16:54,84 --> 0:16:58,32
Yeah! Let's go!


325
0:16:58,32 --> 0:17:0,24
He's lovely, isn't he?


326
0:17:0,24 --> 0:17:3,92
Wouldn't think that if you had to
spend as long as me looking at him.


327
0:17:3,92 --> 0:17:6,64
I meant Father Craig.
So did I.

0:21:6,6 --> 0:21:9,68
might get you into her knickers.


397
0:21:9,68 --> 0:21:12,8
What d'you think she'd really,
really like?


398
0:21:12,8 --> 0:21:20,2
What d'you reckon'd make her happy?
Her and the boys?


399
0:21:20,2 --> 0:21:22,32
What's going on?


400
0:21:22,32 --> 0:21:24,641
Well, I just want you to be happy,
that's all.


401
0:21:24,641 --> 0:21:26,16
So...


402
0:21:26,16 --> 0:21:39,88
I did something
that'd make you happy.


403
0:21:39,88 --> 0:21:42,48
So you robbed my car?


404
0:21:42,48 --> 0:21:43,8
Borrowed.


405
0:21:43,8 --> 0:21:44,879
Then what the fuck did you give him?


406
0:21:44,879 --> 0:21:47,321
Just a load of ale.
Bottle of whisky.


407
0:21:47,321 --> 0:21:51,12
And? Some pills I found in Micky's
sock drawer.


408
0:21:51,12 --> 0:21:51,561
The blue ones?


409
0:21:51,561 --> 0:21:52,92
Orange?


410
0:21:52,92 --> 0:21:54,4
Not the yellow ones.


411
0:21:54,4 --> 0:21:57,92
One of them'd floor all the Happy
Mondays! How many d'you slip him?


412
0:21:57,92 --> 0:21:59,28
Four.


413
0:21:59,28 --> 0:22:1,16
Oh! Well no wonder he's dead!


414
0:22:1,16 --> 0:22:4,6
They're meant for horses
of a nervous disposition!


415
0:22:4,6 --> 0:22:7,39
What in the name of God
did you think you were doing?


416
0:22:7,39 --> 0:22:9,441
You said you'd be impressed
if I got rid of him!


417
0:22:9,441 --> 0:22:12,44
I didn't mean kill him,
you thick twat!


418
0:22:12,44 --> 0:22:15,64
I meant out of my line of vision
for a split second!


419
0:22:15,64 --> 0:22:18,32
Out of my range of hearing,
not bleeding dead!


420
0:22:18,32 --> 0:22:21,36
So what we going to do?


421
0:22:21,36 --> 0:22:24,8
Pray for forgiveness.
He's killed a Priest.


422
0:22:24,8 --> 0:22:28,92
Well, let him fucking pray then.
It's nowt to do with us.


423
0:22:28,92 --> 0:22:31,321
I'm going to hell.
And I'm not even Catholic!


424
0:22:31,321 --> 0:22:34,28
Oh, and you think God's going
to turn a blind eye to the fact


425
0:22:34,28 --> 0:22:39,16
that we're sitting round discussing
how to get shot of the body!?


426
0:22:39,16 --> 0:22:41,201
Er, excuse me, I
just came up with a


427
0:22:41,201 --> 0:22:43,24
solution that went down
like a lead balloon.


428
0:22:43,24 --> 0:22:47,32
The solution being that we take him
to your mate's sausage factory?!


429
0:22:47,32 --> 0:22:48,96
You've never objected before.


430
0:22:48,96 --> 0:22:54,2
I've never turned a priest
into a sausage before!


431
0:22:54,2 --> 0:22:56,2
We'll be excommunicated.


432
0:22:56,2 --> 0:22:59,4
We're already excommunicated.


433
0:22:59,4 --> 0:23:2,28
Call your mate.
Make the arrangements.


434
0:23:2,28 --> 0:23:4,24
Hang on...


435
0:23:4,24 --> 0:23:7,0
You're not actually going
to go through with this?


436
0:23:7,0 --> 0:23:9,24
Have you got a better solution?


437
0:23:9,24 --> 0:23:15,28
Remarkable. Just when I thought
you'd never be able to shock me...


438
0:23:15,28 --> 0:23:20,2
OK, if we're going ahead with this,
you need to make yourself scarce.


439
0:23:20,2 --> 0:23:24,4
No way! He got us into this shit,
he's going to help get us out!


440
0:23:24,4 --> 0:23:26,541
They'll get a fair few
sausages out of him,


441
0:23:26,541 --> 0:23:28,68
though, won't they?
He was a big lad, wasn't he?


442
0:23:28,68 --> 0:23:52,64
Fucking arse!


443
0:23:52,64 --> 0:23:53,681
Kelly!


444
0:23:53,681 --> 0:23:58,48
What d'you want?


445
0:23:58,48 --> 0:24:0,84
Played me for a fool, didn't you?


446
0:24:0,84 --> 0:24:2,52
No.


447
0:24:2,52 --> 0:24:6,72
Not that I blame you. I am a fucking
idiot... falling for you... your lies.


448
0:24:6,72 --> 0:24:9,28
If you think I lied,
why did you come?


449
0:24:9,28 --> 0:24:14,12
To tell you to get out my life,
to keep on running.


450
0:24:14,12 --> 0:24:16,401
Fuck off so far away from me
and never come back!


451
0:24:16,401 --> 0:24:19,4
Sue left me.


452
0:24:19,4 --> 0:24:21,8
She walked out and took the kids.


453
0:24:21,8 --> 0:24:24,6
She wanted stuff I couldn't give her
and...


454
0:24:24,6 --> 0:24:26,2
She found someone who could.


455
0:24:26,2 --> 0:24:28,76
And I begged her...


456
0:24:28,76 --> 0:24:33,76
I begged her to come back,
but she said, "To what?"


457
0:24:33,76 --> 0:24:36,28
To what.


458
0:24:36,28 --> 0:24:38,52
I was on my own.


459
0:24:38,52 --> 0:24:41,24
And I was getting pissed most nights
cos...


460
0:24:41,24 --> 0:24:47,56
And I lost my job cos I couldn't
get out of bed for the hangovers.


461
0:24:47,56 --> 0:24:50,2
I ended up on the street.


462
0:24:50,2 --> 0:24:53,32
And I was angry with myself,
I was so angry.


463
0:24:53,32 --> 0:24:58,64
I'd lost my wife, my kids...
My job, my flat.


464
0:24:58,64 --> 0:25:6,44
So you set fire to them?


465
0:25:6,44 --> 0:25:11,32
Took a while,
but here he is at last, eh?


466
0:25:11,32 --> 0:25:13,88
Will the real Marty Fisher
please stand up.


467
0:25:13,88 --> 0:25:16,56
Look...
The lying, murdering Marty Fisher.


468
0:25:16,56 --> 0:25:17,481
No, no, I-I-I...


469
0:25:17,481 --> 0:25:19,0
Save it.


470
0:25:19,0 --> 0:25:25,24
I thought you were different.


471
0:25:25,24 --> 0:25:27,64
Fucking cliche alert!


472
0:25:27,64 --> 0:25:30,72
I hope they find you, Marty.


473
0:25:30,72 --> 0:25:36,4
I hope the filth drag you in
and I hope you go down for life.


474
0:25:36,4 --> 0:25:39,32
Sue didn't deserve that.


475
0:25:39,32 --> 0:25:43,16
And your kids...


476
0:25:43,16 --> 0:25:44,601
K-K-Kelly...


477
0:25:44,601 --> 0:25:46,2
Fuck off.


478
0:25:46,2 --> 0:25:50,4
I love you!


479
0:25:50,4 --> 0:26:13,4
And I love Shane.


480
0:26:13,4 --> 0:26:14,441
Shit!


481
0:26:14,441 --> 0:26:16,441
They're still looking for Marty.


482
0:26:16,441 --> 0:26:19,88
Right, Father Craig's pissed
after an all-night wake.


483
0:26:19,88 --> 0:26:22,48
We're taking him back to church.
Everyone stay calm.


484
0:26:22,48 --> 0:26:23,839
Can I ask where you're going, lads?


485
0:26:23,839 --> 0:26:26,241
Just bringing a mate home.
Bit worse for wear.


486
0:26:26,241 --> 0:26:29,4
Hope you sober up for Sunday,
Father! Me daughter's christening.


487
0:26:29,4 --> 0:26:31,2
He's going to puke!


488
0:26:31,2 --> 0:26:32,921
Do you want to get out, Father?


489
0:26:32,921 --> 0:26:34,52
No! He's just rat-arsed.


490
0:26:34,52 --> 0:26:35,879
Don't tell the Pope(!)


491
0:26:35,879 --> 0:26:37,881
(LAUGHS) D'you want to open the boot
for us, please?


492
0:26:37,881 --> 0:26:39,2
(WHIMPERS)


493
0:26:39,2 --> 0:26:40,0
Shh!


494
0:26:40,0 --> 0:26:42,4
I can't...


495
0:26:42,4 --> 0:26:46,12
Shut the fuck up!


496
0:26:46,12 --> 0:26:46,999
Yeah, that's great, mate.


497
0:26:46,999 --> 0:26:48,279
Cheers.


498
0:26:48,279 --> 0:26:50,1
Your other mate looks bad, too.


499
0:26:50,1 --> 0:26:53,88
He can't handle his booze. Think it
was the punch what finished him off!


500
0:26:53,88 --> 0:26:59,96
That'll teach him. Cheers, lads.


501
0:26:59,96 --> 0:27:5,24
See you, Father!


502
0:27:5,24 --> 0:27:6,32
Vodka.


503
0:27:6,32 --> 0:27:7,32
Double.


504
0:27:7,32 --> 0:27:8,799
And one for yourself, Mimi.


505
0:27:8,799 --> 0:27:11,199
Fuck knows you could do with one.
What you having?


506
0:27:11,199 --> 0:27:16,96
Bit early for me.


507
0:27:16,96 --> 0:27:20,88
To the useless, lying,
two-faced, manipulative,


508
0:27:20,88 --> 0:27:23,92
deceitful gang of total
bastardry that is men!


509
0:27:23,92 --> 0:27:26,2
Fuck knows I'll drink to that.


510
0:27:26,2 --> 0:27:29,52
Unless it's our Shane
you're talking about?


511
0:27:29,52 --> 0:27:35,92
A punter.
Finally revealed his true colours.


512
0:27:35,92 --> 0:27:37,161
Same again please, Mimi.


513
0:27:37,161 --> 0:27:40,68
You're working in ten minutes.
The barbershop quartet's in.


514
0:27:40,68 --> 0:27:43,119
You fuck 'em. Turn the light off,
they'd never know the difference.


515
0:27:43,119 --> 0:27:44,321
Course they would!


516
0:27:44,321 --> 0:27:47,88
This is the male of the species
we're talking about, brains in cocks.


517
0:27:47,88 --> 0:27:50,44
And there's not much room in there
for a brain.


518
0:27:50,44 --> 0:27:53,96
Fuck 'em yourself, or better still,
tell 'em to go fuck themselves.


519
0:27:53,96 --> 0:27:56,84
You've had two verbal warnings,
Kelly.


520
0:27:56,84 --> 0:27:57,961
Third written.


521
0:27:57,961 --> 0:28:0,4
What - you're going to dismiss me?


522
0:28:0,4 --> 0:28:4,56
Then I take you to a tribunal and...
Oh, no, that's right I can't!


523
0:28:4,56 --> 0:28:6,8
On account of your business
being illegal


524
0:28:6,8 --> 0:28:9,4
and you'd end up in nick
for being a madam!


525
0:28:9,4 --> 0:28:14,48
Madame!


526
0:28:14,48 --> 0:28:16,36
All you need do sometimes,


527
0:28:16,36 --> 0:28:19,48
is take a step back
to get a good perspective, isn't it?


528
0:28:19,48 --> 0:28:21,16
Where's all this coming from?


529
0:28:21,16 --> 0:28:23,96
From me being let down
once too often. That's where from.


530
0:28:23,96 --> 0:28:25,8
Shane?


531
0:28:25,8 --> 0:28:27,2
No, we're good.


532
0:28:27,2 --> 0:28:29,52
Yeah?


533
0:28:29,52 --> 0:28:50,0
Yeah.


534
0:28:50,0 --> 0:28:52,24
Y'all right, kidda?


535
0:28:52,24 --> 0:28:53,279
All right, mate?


536
0:28:53,279 --> 0:28:53,919
Not bad, mate?


537
0:28:53,919 --> 0:28:56,4
Yeah, good-good.


538
0:28:56,4 --> 0:29:0,92
Nice one.


539
0:29:0,92 --> 0:29:2,121
All right, boys.


540
0:29:2,121 --> 0:29:4,16
All right, mate.


541
0:29:4,16 --> 0:29:6,24
Right, we need to get him in here,
yeah?


542
0:29:6,24 --> 0:29:8,32
And then get him
to the processing room.


543
0:29:8,32 --> 0:29:10,92
There'll be a tea break
in ten minutes. It'll be empty.


544
0:29:10,92 --> 0:29:11,961
I'll need a hand stripping him.


545
0:29:11,961 --> 0:29:13,8
I'll do it.


546
0:29:13,8 --> 0:29:24,48
You want to bring him over here,
Mickey?


547
0:29:24,48 --> 0:29:32,48
Oof!


548
0:29:32,48 --> 0:29:42,76
Shit!


549
0:29:42,76 --> 0:30:4,88
Mam... you need to be here,
and quick.


550
0:30:4,88 --> 0:30:5,96
Eh!


551
0:30:5,96 --> 0:30:9,4
You said you'd checked he was dead!


552
0:30:9,4 --> 0:30:10,639
I did!


553
0:30:10,639 --> 0:30:24,76
Well, you obviously
didn't check properly!


554
0:30:24,76 --> 0:30:31,88
(SIGHS)


555
0:30:31,88 --> 0:30:34,84
It's a miracle.
I'm telling you, it's a miracle!


556
0:30:34,84 --> 0:30:43,36
Go! Leave the talking to me.


557
0:30:43,36 --> 0:30:46,92
And I prayed and prayed to God


558
0:30:46,92 --> 0:30:52,32
to find a solution and he did.


559
0:30:52,32 --> 0:30:55,4
You OK, Father?


560
0:30:55,4 --> 0:30:57,4
I, er...


561
0:30:57,4 --> 0:30:59,92
I don't know.


562
0:30:59,92 --> 0:31:2,6
I'm sorry, Mimi,
I'm not feeling 100%.


563
0:31:2,6 --> 0:31:8,92
Must've nodded off.


564
0:31:8,92 --> 0:31:13,8
Had the weirdest dream.


565
0:31:13,8 --> 0:31:20,8
And the Lord said to me...


566
0:31:20,8 --> 0:31:23,36
Next time you want to impress me,
try a bunch of roses,


567
0:31:23,36 --> 0:31:24,841
a box of chocolates.


568
0:31:24,841 --> 0:31:27,4
We were lucky this time, Billy.


569
0:31:27,4 --> 0:31:28,439
Make sure there isn't a next time.


570
0:31:28,439 --> 0:31:30,839
You said he was a problem.
Thought you wanted rid.


571
0:31:30,839 --> 0:31:32,361
Why'd she go to you if she did?


572
0:31:32,361 --> 0:31:34,68
Cos... cos I'm the father
of her child.


573
0:31:34,68 --> 0:31:35,881
That was a biological accident.


574
0:31:35,881 --> 0:31:37,84
A happy one!


575
0:31:37,84 --> 0:31:39,721
Yeah, but an accident
none the less, Mum.


576
0:31:39,721 --> 0:31:41,36
Get this straight, Billy.


577
0:31:41,36 --> 0:31:44,2
If there's a problem in this family
that needs solving,


578
0:31:44,2 --> 0:31:46,56
this family will solve it,
you got that?


579
0:31:46,56 --> 0:31:49,72
We don't need you. Don't want you.


580
0:31:49,72 --> 0:31:53,32
By the way, you've pissed yourself.


581
0:31:53,32 --> 0:31:59,12
Oh!


582
0:31:59,12 --> 0:32:1,52
RADIO PLAYS


583
0:32:1,52 --> 0:32:3,6
Oh, that hit the spot.


584
0:32:3,6 --> 0:32:5,321
It was lovely, that.


585
0:32:5,321 --> 0:32:6,76
Thought you'd like it.


586
0:32:6,76 --> 0:32:8,161
Liked it? I loved it.


587
0:32:8,161 --> 0:32:11,4
You don't have to overdo it, Shane.


588
0:32:11,4 --> 0:32:12,881
No, it was nice that!


589
0:32:12,881 --> 0:32:14,48
It was chips, bacon and egg.


590
0:32:14,48 --> 0:32:16,92
It was great!


591
0:32:16,92 --> 0:32:18,481
I'll do washing up.


592
0:32:18,481 --> 0:32:19,64
No.


593
0:32:19,64 --> 0:32:23,28
Come on, I said...
I know, and I said I'll do it!


594
0:32:23,28 --> 0:32:24,521
Sorry.


595
0:32:24,521 --> 0:32:25,72
No, it's me.


596
0:32:25,72 --> 0:32:27,72
No, I'm probably trying a bit...


597
0:32:27,72 --> 0:32:28,841
Don't. It's not you.


598
0:32:28,841 --> 0:32:30,28
This.


599
0:32:30,28 --> 0:32:31,96
It's not you. It's me, Shane.


600
0:32:31,96 --> 0:32:35,12
Just, em...


601
0:32:35,12 --> 0:32:36,76
(SIGHS)


602
0:32:36,76 --> 0:32:40,52
it's just me.


603
0:32:40,52 --> 0:32:48,76
That mean I can go watch the footy
that I recorded?


604
0:32:48,76 --> 0:32:55,4
I love you, Kelly Maguire.


605
0:32:55,4 --> 0:33:3,24
Yeah, you said.


606
0:33:3,24 --> 0:33:22,52
Thank you, Carmel.


607
0:33:22,52 --> 0:33:24,801
Just thought we'd give you this,
Father.


608
0:33:24,801 --> 0:33:27,4
Our contribution
to the new roof for the vestry.


609
0:33:27,4 --> 0:33:30,16
Oh, that's very kind. Thank you.


610
0:33:30,16 --> 0:33:31,801
So, ten minutes, yeah?


611
0:33:31,801 --> 0:33:33,76
For?


612
0:33:33,76 --> 0:33:35,96
(LAUGHS) Nice one.


613
0:33:35,96 --> 0:33:37,401
Making out he's forgot.


614
0:33:37,401 --> 0:33:39,12
You!


615
0:33:39,12 --> 0:33:40,679
Cilla's christening.


616
0:33:40,679 --> 0:33:42,641
Two o'clock.


617
0:33:42,641 --> 0:33:44,2
You did say two?


618
0:33:44,2 --> 0:33:49,12
Course I didn't forget,
how could I forget a thing like that.


619
0:33:49,12 --> 0:33:52,72
And Billy is proper excited, yeah.


620
0:33:52,72 --> 0:33:55,52
About getting christened,
the same time as his daughter!


621
0:33:55,52 --> 0:33:57,88
Very kind of you to fast-track him.


622
0:33:57,88 --> 0:33:59,6
He's welling up.


623
0:33:59,6 --> 0:34:3,36
You know, he's so proud.


624
0:34:3,36 --> 0:34:3,839
I'm going myself.


625
0:34:3,839 --> 0:34:9,12
I'll just prepare.


626
0:34:9,12 --> 0:34:17,0
(WHISPERS) I'm sorry.


627

629
0:34:25,84 --> 0:34:27,321
What the fuck's going on?!


630
0:34:27,321 --> 0:34:28,44
Baptism.


631
0:34:28,44 --> 0:34:30,84
Cilla's. And you're godparents.


632
0:34:30,84 --> 0:34:33,4
Lovely.


633
0:34:33,4 --> 0:34:33,359
When?


634
0:34:33,359 --> 0:34:34,561
Now.


635
0:34:34,561 --> 0:34:35,6
Nice one.


636
0:34:35,6 --> 0:34:38,32
If I snuff it, soft arse'd
get custody of Cilla.


637
0:34:38,32 --> 0:34:41,24
That's not going to happen.


638
0:34:41,24 --> 0:34:43,1
Look at him.


639
0:34:43,1 --> 0:34:44,6
He's a lovely lad,


640
0:34:44,6 --> 0:34:47,56
but a few bricks short
of a full hod, know what I mean?


641
0:34:47,56 --> 0:34:49,72
Mimi, I don't actually believe in...


642
0:34:49,72 --> 0:34:53,32
We've heard it all before, Kelly.
You don't believe in God, we know.


643
0:34:53,32 --> 0:34:56,52
Half the congregation'll
be in the same boat.


644
0:34:56,52 --> 0:34:59,44
I just want you to nod
when you're supposed to,


645
0:34:59,44 --> 0:35:2,0
light a candle, renounce the devil,


646
0:35:2,0 --> 0:35:4,92
then get back to the pub
and get pissed with the rest of us.


647
0:35:4,92 --> 0:35:6,161
Got that?


648
0:35:6,161 --> 0:35:9,32
Come on, soft lad.


649
0:35:9,32 --> 0:35:11,4
Did that just happen?


650
0:35:11,4 --> 0:35:12,56
Who does she think she is?


651
0:35:12,56 --> 0:35:14,881
Oh, geez. Come on, Kel,
she's always like that.


652
0:35:14,881 --> 0:35:16,36
Well, she can fuck off!


653
0:35:16,36 --> 0:35:18,44
You know what?
You're always like that.


654
0:35:18,44 --> 0:35:21,36
And you're always like that.
Sitting on the fucking fence.


655
0:35:21,36 --> 0:35:24,44
What's it going to take for you
to back me up, mummy's boy?


656
0:35:24,44 --> 0:35:27,16
(LAUGHS)


657
0:35:27,16 --> 0:35:36,32
You knew what you were getting into
when you took me on.


658
0:35:36,32 --> 0:35:40,52
(LAUGHS)


659
0:35:40,52 --> 0:35:42,6
Hang on, wait for me!


660
0:35:42,6 --> 0:36:5,16
MOBILE RINGS


661
0:36:5,16 --> 0:36:7,52
Barbara Castle? In her day.


662
0:36:7,52 --> 0:36:10,4
Edwina Currie? Posh Scouser.


663
0:36:10,4 --> 0:36:12,52
A contradiction in terms.


664
0:36:12,52 --> 0:36:15,6
See, I'd have slotted
Thatcher one in her heyday.


665
0:36:15,6 --> 0:36:18,36
From behind, obviously.
Show her who's boss.


666
0:36:18,36 --> 0:36:19,72
"Ooh, not for turning?"


667
0:36:19,72 --> 0:36:22,24
Well, you fucking will be
after this, Maggie.


668
0:36:22,24 --> 0:36:25,8
One up the mineshaft
in memory of Scargill.


669
0:36:25,8 --> 0:36:27,2
But Widdecombe?


670
0:36:27,2 --> 0:36:31,8
Wouldn't really be an angle
that would satisfy, would there?


671
0:36:31,8 --> 0:36:34,48
It's not as if you could half
close your eyes, so they're all fuzzy


672
0:36:34,48 --> 0:36:37,36
and convince yourself
it's somebody else.


673
0:36:37,36 --> 0:36:40,88
Fucking Churchill would be
a more attractive proposition.


674
0:36:40,88 --> 0:36:43,12
Miliband's got a pretty face.


675
0:36:43,12 --> 0:36:47,4
I think your mistake was going
for someone with such a low profile.


676
0:36:47,4 --> 0:36:48,681
What do you mean?


677
0:36:48,681 --> 0:36:52,28
A priest? If you want to impress
the Maguires, aim high.


678
0:36:52,28 --> 0:36:56,52
Take out some gangster
and you'd be quids in. Telling you.


679
0:36:56,52 --> 0:36:59,44
You want to reach puberty,
keep your trap shut.


680
0:36:59,44 --> 0:37:5,6
Bin. Now.


681
0:37:5,6 --> 0:37:8,76
If I'd wanted a gangster,
I wouldn't have gotten rid of Paddy.


682
0:37:8,76 --> 0:37:12,0
I like you because you're you, OK?


683
0:37:12,0 --> 0:37:15,44
Just be you.


684
0:37:15,44 --> 0:37:19,32
A toast!


685
0:37:19,32 --> 0:37:23,52
To Cilla Maureen Tutton-Maguire.
Welcome to the family.


686
0:37:23,52 --> 0:37:27,56
(ALL) Welcome to the family!


687
0:37:27,56 --> 0:37:30,8
And to Billy Tutton.
Welcome to the family.


688
0:37:30,8 --> 0:37:33,4
(ALL) Welcome to the family!


689
0:37:33,4 --> 0:37:37,24
You're one of us, now.


690
0:37:37,24 --> 0:37:42,72
She means Catholic, by the way.
Not one of them.


691
0:37:42,72 --> 0:37:56,44
Oh, for fuck's sake!


692
0:37:56,44 --> 0:37:58,48
What the fuck's done that?


693
0:37:58,48 --> 0:37:59,121
Rats.


694
0:37:59,121 --> 0:38:25,4
Big fucking rat!


695
0:38:25,4 --> 0:38:28,0
Excuse I for queue jumping.
I've got a turtle's head.


696
0:38:28,0 --> 0:38:29,199
They're all occupied and I'm next.


697
0:38:29,199 --> 0:38:30,639
I'm touching cloth!


698
0:38:30,639 --> 0:38:35,2
Gents!


699
0:38:35,2 --> 0:38:36,48
I'm...


700
0:38:36,48 --> 0:38:38,0
Sorry?


701
0:38:38,0 --> 0:38:41,68
Going to do the decent thing?
Hand yourself in?


702
0:38:41,68 --> 0:38:45,76
Admit you're a fucking scumbag
for killing your wife and kids?


703
0:38:45,76 --> 0:38:47,88
A pathological liar


704
0:38:47,88 --> 0:38:50,4
for making me believe
we had some kind of future?


705
0:38:50,4 --> 0:38:51,801
Wasn't supposed to happen this way.


706
0:38:51,801 --> 0:38:53,92
Too right!


707
0:38:53,92 --> 0:38:56,4
I wasn't supposed
to fall for the nutter


708
0:38:56,4 --> 0:38:59,84
with fuck all to offer but a
criminal record and an empty wallet.


709
0:38:59,84 --> 0:39:4,28
I wanted the white charger and
the shining armour and I get you!


710
0:39:4,28 --> 0:39:9,8
Fucking you!


711
0:39:9,8 --> 0:39:10,799
Lights will be back on any minute.


712
0:39:10,799 --> 0:39:18,48
Great.


713
0:39:18,48 --> 0:39:21,92
Making sure no-one's fallen over,
broken their neck.


714
0:39:21,92 --> 0:39:29,32
Home soon, eh?


715
0:39:29,32 --> 0:39:33,12
You never asked. That's what
fucking hurt. After what we'd said.


716
0:39:33,12 --> 0:39:35,72
What you said you felt.
You never asked.


717
0:39:35,72 --> 0:39:36,84
Never!


718
0:39:36,84 --> 0:39:38,279
What did I never ask, eh?


719
0:39:38,279 --> 0:39:39,41
You fucking lunatic!


720
0:39:39,41 --> 0:39:42,36
I wanted to tell you,
but I wanted you to know me first.


721
0:39:42,36 --> 0:39:46,56
You wanted me to fall for you first!


722
0:39:46,56 --> 0:39:50,8
I didn't do it.
If you need me to, I can prove it.


723
0:39:50,8 --> 0:39:53,96
I didn't do it, Kel.


724
0:39:53,96 --> 0:39:57,24
I couldn't...


725
0:39:57,24 --> 0:40:0,72
But even you thought I could.


726
0:40:0,72 --> 0:40:8,32
Even you.


727
0:40:8,32 --> 0:40:11,64
I'll be at the bus stop.


728
0:40:11,64 --> 0:40:14,52
Corner of Muirfield Avenue


729
0:40:14,52 --> 0:40:19,8
and Lytton Street - nine o'clock.


730
0:40:19,8 --> 0:40:20,88
I want to start again.


731
0:40:20,88 --> 0:40:24,2
New life...


732
0:40:24,2 --> 0:40:26,2
with someone I love.


733
0:40:26,2 --> 0:40:31,64
Someone I never thought
I'd have the luck to come across.


734
0:40:31,64 --> 0:40:33,4
It's a lot to think about, I know,


735
0:40:33,4 --> 0:40:39,64
and I would've done it sooner if
all this hadn't have happened, but...


736
0:40:39,64 --> 0:40:41,6
I love you


737
0:40:41,6 --> 0:40:53,8
