###1 FRED PHELPS: What's wrong with this country and England and
###3 the world is that they have bought Satan's lie that it's
###8 OK to be gay.
###11 Our message is, it's not OK to be gay.
###15 It will warp the mind, destroy the soul, and damn the nation,
###20 damn the nation.
###22 Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka is an Old School, or
###26 Primitive Baptist, church.
###27 
###32 DENISE HALL: You know, he's quite a showman,
###33 and he knows that.
###34 They've gotten a big long run out of this.
###36 
###41 FEMALE SPEAKER: Make a sign.
###42 God hates fags.
###43 That's all you've got to do.
###47 SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: This generation teaches their
###49 children it is in fact OK to be gay.
###52 That is a lie.
###53 
###57 STEVE DRAIN: It's amazing how much Bible a little child can
###61 know and retain.
###63 LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: All we ever knew growing up, all we
###64 ever talked about, was the ministry of the WBC.
###68 And they expect everyone to bow down and do everything
###70 they want them to do.
###72 
###80 FRED PHELPS: Do your worst!
###82 I dare you!
###83 Try to stop us!
###85 
###99 MALE SPEAKER: Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas
###102 presents the Old School Baptist Hour
###105 with Pastor Fred Phelps.
###108 FRED PHELPS: This is Fred Phelps.
###110 Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka is an Old School or
###114 Primitive Baptist Church.
###117 Many people nowadays do not know what an Old School or
###120 Primitive Baptist is, but in early America, they abounded
###125 and were well known.
###127 John Leland, who, with James Madison, drafted the First
###131 Amendment to the Constitution, was a
###133 Primitive Baptist preacher.
###136 MALE SPEAKER: Through the years that Vice has followed
###137 this story, no character stood out more to us than the family
###140 of Steve Drain, the only members of the Westboro
###143 Baptist Church not related by blood.
###145 STEVE DRAIN: Came up here to do a documentary film on
###147 Westboro Baptist Church.
###148 I always thought that it would be an
###150 interesting subject matter.
###151 I went around one Thanksgiving weekend knocking on doors.
###156 Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, asking people what do
###158 you believe, and why do you believe it?
###160 The overwhelming conclusion that I was reaching was that
###164 people have no idea what they believe and why they believe
###166 it, but they keep on doing it anyway.
###168 MALE SPEAKER: 12 years ago, Steve Drain was a 35-year-old
###170 aspiring filmmaker who wanted to expose the Phelps and the
###173 Westboro Baptist congregation as frauds, or as he put it,
###177 snake oil salesmen.
###178 STEVE DRAIN: So then I thought, you know what?
###179 I'm going to go one step further, and I'm going to ask
###181 the pastors, the men in charge, the men of the cloth,
###184 so to speak.
###185 Now, what happened was I came up here to start doing these
###188 interviews.
###190 They threw me a curveball.
###191 I was supposed to interview a lot of other people and then
###192 work my way up to Gramps and talk to him
###194 there toward the end.
###196 Well, when I was halfway between here and Lawrence,
###198 driving over here for my first day, they said Gramps
###200 wants to talk now.
###202 Pastor Phelps wants to talk now.
###203 And I sat down with him, and we only
###206 stopped to change tape.
###208 It was still mini-DVD back then.
###209 Well, I talked to that guy for four hours.
###211 That interview was just so bad ass.
###213 I went back to Florida, and I researched every answer that
###217 they gave for every single thing that they gave.
###219 And this sounded like these guys weren't going to give a
###222 false answer.
###223 It sounded like these guys weren't going
###224 to pervert the scripture.
###225 That's in fact what it was.
###227 MALE SPEAKER: Fred Phelps was born in 1929, in a small city
###230 of Meridian, Mississippi to a railroad
###232 policeman and homemaker.
###234 After the untimely death of his mother from cancer in
###236 1935, Fred was raised by his great aunt.
###239 
###244 FRED PHELPS: You want to go to hell?
###246 No!
###248 Get real!
###250 MALE SPEAKER: After graduating from high school, Phelps was
###252 accepted to the United States Military
###253 Academy at West Point.
###255 However, after attending a Methodist revival, he turned
###258 his attention to the scripture.
###259 Over the next few years, Phelps bounced around between
###262 several divinity schools until in 1951, he met Margie M
###265 Simms, who he married later that year.
###268 In 1964, Fred Phelps graduated from law school at Washburn
###272 University in Topeka, Kansas, where he settled with his
###275 growing family and founded the Phelps chartered law firm.
###278 Over the course of the next decade, he made quite a name
###280 for himself as a prominent civil rights attorney.
###282 SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: During the civil rights movement, at
###284 KU, there were lots of sit-ins, and those black
###287 students would be arrested.
###288 And there was a prosecutor over in Douglas County that
###290 would prosecute them.
###292 So one of the first things my dad did when he got out of law
###295 school was go over there and defend those students.
###298 MALE SPEAKER: Phelps took cases on behalf of African
###300 American clients alleging racial discrimination by
###302 school districts, racially-based police abuse,
###305 and unconstitutional raids on African American
###307 establishments.
###308 FRED PHELPS: They couldn't get a white lawyer to go to
###310 Lawrence and defend Gale Sayers and
###313 those 102 black students.
###315 So they came to me.
###316 God Almighty, you understand, never said it's an abomination
###321 to be black.
###322 KATHERINE PHELPS: Their rights were at stake, and he didn't
###325 care they didn't have the money.
###328 He took the time to represent their voice.
###331 FEMALE SPEAKER: Fred Phelps is good at raising Cain in the
###333 courtroom and just about everywhere else.
###335 It's earned him the wrath of some, the respect of others.
###338 
###341 STEVE DRAIN: This is a humble man.
###343 This is a bright, a very bright man, who, if he would
###346 have embraced the world rather than humbled himself to the
###349 scripture, I guarantee he would at least be on a federal
###352 court bench somewhere, if not the Supreme Court.
###354 I mean, this guy's a really smart guy.
###356 MALE SPEAKER: In 1977, a formal complaint was filed
###358 against Phelps by the Kansas State Board of Law Examiners
###361 for his conduct during a lawsuit against a
###363 Kansas court reporter.
###365 During the trial, he brutally cross-examined her for a week
###368 and accused her of a variety of perverse sexual acts,
###371 ultimately reducing her to tears on the stand.
###374 Phelps prepared affidavits swearing to the court that he
###376 had eight witnesses whose testimony would convince the
###379 court to rule in his favor.
###381 The court reporter, in turn, obtained sworn signed
###383 affidavits from the eight people in question, all of
###386 whom said that Phelps had never contacted them, and they
###389 had no reason to testify against her.
###391 Phelps had committed perjury, and on July 20, 1979, was
###395 permanently disbarred from practicing law in
###397 the state of Kansas.
###398 
###405 LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: We started picketing at Gage Park
###407 because a couple of my cousins were propositioned by
###411 homosexuals.
###412 FEMALE SPEAKER: At about 9:30, a procession of vehicles would
###414 begin circling the park.
###416 People familiar with Gage say they see the same cars night
###419 after night.
###421 LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: We tried to get the government
###422 bodies to clean up the park so they weren't trying to get
###427 little children into the bathrooms with them.
###429 And it didn't work, so we started picketing.
###434 FRED PHELPS: It wouldn't take much, we thought, to drive
###436 those openly promiscuous homosexuals out of Gage Park.
###440 Boy, were we wrong.
###442 LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: We would take out those big,
###444 rectangular, long brown tables, and
###446 we would have picnics.
###448 The law was that you had to walk in a circle.
###450 So we would do that.
###451 The grass would die.
###452 TIMOTHY PHELPS: The first big sign that was made, I made it.
###455 And it said God hates gays.
###457 And it sure got attention.
###459 DENISE HALL: You know, it used to just be here in Topeka.
###462 They would do all these things, and they didn't get
###464 noticed much of any place else.
###466 LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: Remember the fax [INAUDIBLE]?
###468 I'm surprised they didn't hand deliver it before that.
###471 DENISE HALL: And they would send out these horrific faxes
###473 about people, and if anybody would say anything about them,
###477 they would send out more faxes about people.
###480 And it got to be--
###481 in our office, when my husband was alive, we'd get these
###484 faxes in, and he would just turn around and fax
###488 them back to them.
###489 Then it got to the place where they would shut off their fax
###491 machine when they would send these faxes out.
###494 And he'd try to fax them back, and they'd turn the fax
###495 machine off.
###496 So then we couldn't fax them back.
###497 TIM PHELPS: Yeah, they sent out underground picket
###499 schedule, weekly picket schedule.
###501 And at my house, they would print it off and post it in
###504 the kitchen.
###505 You knew where you had to be, if you were supposed to go,
###508 and whatnot.
###510 FRED PHELPS: I would that free grace were more preached
###513 because it gives men something to believe with confidence.
###518 The great mass of professing Christians
###520 know nothing of doctrine.
###522 Their religion consists in going a certain number of
###525 times to a place of worship.
###528 But they have no care for truth one way or another.
###532 I speak without any prejudice in this matter.
###536 TIM PHELPS: 2004, 2005, it's right where it's hitting big
###538 on God hates America.
###541 No 4th of July, none of the other stuff
###543 that we used to do.
###544 LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: Then they started ramping up with
###545 the military, and the picketing the funerals, and
###547 things like that.
###548 Everything started ramping up and getting
###550 more and more extreme.
###551 MALE SPEAKER: In 2006, Westboro organized a picket at
###554 the Westminster, Maryland funeral of Matthew Snyder, the
###557 US Marine who was killed in Iraq, featuring banners
###559 stating thank God for dead soldiers.
###561 They soon found themselves back in court when a lawsuit
###564 was filed shortly after by Albert Snyder, the deceased
###567 Marine's father.
###568 Snyder won a $10.9 million judgment against the Westboro
###571 Baptist Church.
###572 FEMALE SPEAKER: We thank God for the $10.9.
###575 FEMALE SPEAKER: The $10.9.
###575 FEMALE SPEAKER: The $10.9 million.
###576 CHILDREN: Thank God for $10.9 million.
###581 FEMALE SPEAKER: I thank God for the $10.9 million verdict
###583 because it's a small price to pay to get this message,
###586 America is doomed, in front of the eyes of whole world.
###589 You can't pay for worldwide publicity that cheap.
###593 MALE SPEAKER: The Snyder lawsuit, if your appeals are
###595 exhausted, will you willingly pay the damages?
###599 SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: No.
###600 No.
###600 Here's what you need to do.
###602 You need to forget that lawsuit.
###604 That lawsuit has a purpose.
###606 This nation intended it unto us for evil, but God intends
###610 it unto us for good.
###613 MALE SPEAKER: In 2011, the US Supreme Court decided eight to
###616 one that Westboro's actions constituted protected free
###619 speech, and the judgment was overturned.
###621 Albert Snyder was later ordered to pay Westboro's
###624 legal costs.
###625 SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: If it wasn't for the fact that I
###627 believe every word of those scriptures and I know
###629 everything that our God does is proper and perfect and
###633 righteous, I'd almost feel sorry for those people.
###637 FEMALE SPEAKER: Recorded yesterday at 5:06.
###641 MALE SPEAKER: You fucking piece of shit cocksuckers.
###643 I don't give a fuck if you're a bunch of lawyers or not.
###645 I'm telling you now, the next time I hear of you desecrating
###649 a soldier, the whole lot of you are going to fucking die.
###653 I'll fucking stick a bomb in every fucking house you own.
###656 I'll fucking blow up the law office, and I'll fucking cut
###660 your fucking neck, Fred Phelps.
###662 
###666 MALE SPEAKER: It was during the editing of his
###667 documentary, "Hatemongers" that Steve claims he underwent
###669 a supernatural conversion.
###671 After much thought, contemplation, and discussions
###674 with his wife Luci, Steve packed up his two daughters,
###677 Taylor and Lauren, and moved the family to Topeka, Kansas.
###681 STEVE DRAIN: They both play piano.
###682 The banjo and cool hat's cooler for pictures.
###686 She's starting to play a little guitar.
###688 I play guitar.
###689 
###698 When we bought this house, it was in pretty rough shape, but
###701 the location was great.
###703 So you know, we wanted to be by the church.
###705 So little by little, we've changed it up.
###708 We like to kind of keep it kind of colorful.
###710 We've got our little signs of the times deal there.
###713 We went to Sundance Film Festival in Utah, and we were
###717 picketing Kevin Smith, "Red State." At Sundance, when we
###721 were over there fussing at Kevin Smith, I told those
###725 fags-- they came over there-- and I told those fags, because
###728 they were asking me mockingly, how do I go to heaven, Steve?
###731 I said, take a piece of barbed wire, could be sharp, could be
###736 rusted, I don't care, and lop your junk off.
###740 Do a lot of editing in there.
###741 Do a lot of the website work in there.
###742 It's kind of messy.
###743 And the living room here.
###745 Matter of fact, last time Louis Theroux was here, this
###747 is where I showed Louis Theroux the really bad Jew
###752 parody video with the guys with the little [INAUDIBLE].
###756 You never saw that?
###758 Two Jews fighting over a penny.
###759 
###769 Got to do something.
###772 Check this out.
###773 
###775 MALE SPEAKER: All right, welcome back.
###776 So now, joining us live via satellite, [INAUDIBLE].
###780 MALE SPEAKER: I'm real sorry about what happened to your
###782 son, Mr. Snyder, and I assure you, God had
###785 nothing to do with it.
###787 
###790 JOE STRAMOWSKI: Your Joel Osteen kinda sounds like a
###791 George W Bush.
###793 STEVE DRAIN: I know.
###795 I just use what I got, dude.
###797 JOE STRAMOWSKI: It's a good George W Bush.
###799 MALE SPEAKER: Since making his profession of faith and
###801 accepting Baptism into the Westboro Baptist church fold,
###804 Steve has since become its Public Information Officer,
###807 basically its propaganda minister in chief.
###812 MALE SPEAKER: [SINGING]
###812 Shame taught your children God's a liar.
###817 Shame made [INAUDIBLE]
###819 STEVE DRAIN: Well, the way we do it is
###821 we're writing parodies.
###822 So we're trying to replace those lyrics with lyrics that
###826 are Biblically sound.
###828 Of course, it has to fit a hook.
###831 FEMALE SPEAKER: Check them out now.
###832 FEMALE SPEAKER: [SINGING]
###832 Pimpin' on your G-O-D.
###834 FEMALE SPEAKER: [SINGING]
###835 God's gonna stand there and watch you burn.
###839 But that's all right because you wouldn't heed His word.
###845 
###849 STEVE DRAIN: When we make our choices of songs, that really
###852 revolves around mostly popularity.
###854 It's mostly mainstream stuff.
###857 The whole idea of our doing parodies is to preach.
###860 So we're trying to get as many ears on songs, as many eyes on
###864 videos as possible.
###866 Well, we have the Feel Good Inc. We did Fear God.
###869 MALE SPEAKER: [SINGING]
###870 Don't stop.
###870 Get it.
###871 Get it.
###871 It's only [INAUDIBLE]
###873 Watch as God annihilates.
###874 Ha ha ha ha ha.
###878 STEVE DRAIN: Sometimes a classic thing like the
###879 Beatles, you know.
###880 MALE SPEAKER: [SINGING] [INAUDIBLE]
###881 the Jews.
###882 [INAUDIBLE] the Jews.
###883 
###886 STEVE DRAIN: We did Michael Jackson for a little while
###888 around the time that he died.
###889 That was kind of a big thing.
###890 
###900 Most of what people got mad at us for was we were using
###903 "Thriller" dance moves for "Beat It" and "Bad" parodies.
###911 It's just, that's kind of a cool thing to do.
###913 So they were like chasing us for that.
###915 We were like, really?
###916 Yeah, we know that.
###918 FRED PHELPS: You taught these kids from the time they
###921 started school that it's OK to be gay.
###924 So therefore, you busted their moral compass.
###927 The same God that said thou shall not kill said thou shall
###933 not lie with mankind as a womankind, and affixed the
###937 death penalty for both sins.
###940 And you taught them that God didn't mean what he said about
###943 one, so if it's OK to be gay, it's OK to kill.
###946 
###950 STEVE DRAIN: Hey, I got an idea.
###951 Let's rip the babies out of the wombs of these fool
###954 American women on the back of their fornication.
###958 And then let's break the moral compasses of the kids that do
###961 end up getting born, raise them up for the devil, and
###964 then hand them a gun and go send them off to fight bloody
###967 wars that we have no business fighting in the first place,
###969 and we certainly can't win.
###970 SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: You sit them in your homes, in your
###973 classrooms, in your so-called churches, and you teach them
###977 rebellion against the standards of God.
###980 STEVE DRAIN: Look, when we take these kids out on these
###982 picket lines, they see the difference.
###986 The mind starts working pretty early.
###989 They see the difference between the way we conduct
###992 ourselves and how we cleave to the scripture.
###995 We're sinners like anybody else.
###996 But the main difference between God's elect and the
###998 reprobate is we're ashamed of our sin.
###1000 We're not proud of it.
###1001 We don't want to continue it.
###1002 We want to stop it.
###1003 SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: This generation has taught these
###1005 children it is in fact OK to have sex early, often, with
###1011 anyone you want to, or any animal that you want to.
###1015 There is special anger from God about what you do with
###1018 your children because the scripture
###1020 says they know nothing.
###1023 FRED PHELPS: And all such gifts as accompany salvation
###1027 are reserved by that same sovereign God for
###1031 his sheep, his elect.
###1033 
###1039 MALE SPEAKER: Shouldn't they have the chance to decide
###1041 first, before they're out here?
###1044 REBEKAH PHELPS-DAVIS: That's like saying--
###1045 that's like if you were to ask me, shouldn't they have a
###1047 right to decide whether they should go to school and learn
###1052 before you send them to school to learn?
###1056 I mean, this is more important even than that.
###1058 
###1061 MALE SPEAKER: Any one of these children, when they're a
###1062 little bit older, if they decide that this is not
###1065 something that they want to be a part of, will
###1067 they still be allowed--
###1068 are they still going to be a member of these families, a
###1070 member of this community?
###1071 REBEKAH PHELPS-DAVIS: Don't you understand that if they do
###1072 not believe this message that the Lord our God has given us,
###1077 there isn't going to be a discussion about how can I
###1081 stay, even if I don't believe the way you do.
###1083 They will naturally go.
###1087 They will just go.
###1088 
###1092 LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: I was there for almost 26 years.
###1095 I left a month before my 26th birthday.
###1098 And talking about childhood, we started picketing when I
###1101 was eight years old.
###1103 We thought it was great.
###1104 
###1110 FEMALE SPEAKER: I just want the American public to know
###1113 that with Barack Obama as your president, he's going to lead
###1115 this nation to its final destruction.
###1117 
###1124 STEVE DRAIN: We understand it's not like
###1125 you flip the switch.
###1127 It's not like you prepare the kids, prepare the kids,
###1129 prepare the kids, and then it happens to them.
###1131 It's happening to them all along.
###1133 I mean, these kids go to the elementary school, and they're
###1135 thought of as walking picket signs.
###1137 LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: Yeah, because we're supposed to be a
###1138 testament to the other kids in there.
###1141 Every time anybody looked at us, all they would be thinking
###1144 is God hates fags.
###1145 TIM PHELPS: That word, yeah.
###1146 Those words.
###1147 LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: And you're going to hell.
###1148 Because you have to do everything that they want.
###1151 They have absolute control over everything.
###1152 And if you don't do what they want, then
###1154 you are out of there.
###1156 Whenever somebody gets in trouble, we can't
###1160 talk to them at all.
###1162 TIM PHELPS: It's like isolation.
###1163 LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: Yeah.
###1164 It's ridiculous.
###1165 STEVE DRAIN: Well, I mean, they'll
###1167 definitely question things.
###1167 Any kid will question things.
###1169 But your job is to raise somebody in the nurturing
###1171 [INAUDIBLE] the Lord.
###1172 There's a big difference, Joe, between questioning things,
###1175 the natural inquisitive nature, versus doing that from
###1181 a Bible perspective.
###1183 TIM PHELPS: The expectations for us were higher, or were
###1186 really high for grades and how you act in school.
###1189 And so that also is you're the walking picket sign for those
###1194 words, along with this perfect student child.
###1198 LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: Oh, yeah.
###1199 Exactly.
###1199 That's definitely it.
###1200 Yeah, they wanted people to hate us.
###1204 And we were told that everyone was going to hate us.
###1205 And if anyone acted like they were our friends--
###1208 TIM PHELPS: They were lying.
###1209 LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: Yeah, exactly.
###1210 In their heart, they really hate us.
###1214 In the back of my mind, I'd always be worried about what
###1216 my family thought.
###1218 Like if I got put on the news, I would worry about what they
###1222 would think I was saying, and try to please them.
###1225 If there was a car ride, or if we were on an airplane, we
###1227 would talk about why we were picketing somewhere.
###1229 So we would all have the same answer because they were real
###1231 big on everyone's of one mind and one accord.
###1235 So we all have to say the same thing.
###1237 STEVE DRAIN: Let's just take a broad view of America from a
###1240 Bible perspective.
###1242 TAYLOR DRAIN: All of these things that are happening
###1244 today, all these shootings, they're from God's hand.
###1246 SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: God sent the shooters.
###1247 MARGE PHELPS: So now there's been a rash of shooters.
###1250 STEVE DRAIN: God says, thou shall not lie with--
###1252 SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: Mankind as with womankind.
###1254 FRED PHELPS: It is an abomination.
###1256 SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: Global warming.
###1257 MARGE PHELPS: And hurricanes and floods.
###1259 STEVE DRAIN: God says no divorce, no remarriage.
###1261 SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: You are living in adultery.
###1262 STEVE DRAIN: It's OK to be gay.
###1263 SHIRLEY PHELPS-ROPER: It is in fact OK to be gay.
###1265 We're entitled to do what we want with our own bodies.
###1268 MARGE PHELPS: That's like the killer saying, I killed
###1270 someone last night, but God forgives me.
###1273 I'm going to go kill someone again tonight, but God
###1275 forgives me.
###1276 TIM PHELPS: And I know with the little,
###1278 younger kids, they would--
###1281 what does this sign mean?
###1282 And they would explain it to them.
###1284 And then so you have these even younger kids who can just
###1287 spit off these words that they probably don't even
###1288 understand.
###1290 LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: It wasn't a very pleasant place
###1292 to live, even though they act like it's the most wonderful
###1295 place on earth.
###1297 TIM PHELPS: Well, to them it probably is.
###1299 LIBBY (PHELPS) ALVAREZ: That's a little bit ridiculous.
###1302 JOE STRAMOWSKI: Let's just talk general politics.
###1303 Who's your pick for November?
###1305 STEVE DRAIN: Well, did you ever see that "South Park"
###1308 episode, "Giant Douche and Turd Sandwich?"
###1310 JOE STRAMOWSKI: Yes.
###1311 STEVE DRAIN: That's what the deal is because there really

###1323 government.
###1324 You wouldn't be able to promise billions of dollars
###1329 internationally to help fund abortions, for instance.
###1332 You wouldn't be able to do that at all.
###1334 You'd have to end AIDS research.
###1338 You'd have to re- institute the death penalty for
###1347 homosexuality.

###1351 that's so outlandish that he can go, oh, I'm going to push
###1354 somebody else's button.
###1356 STEVE DRAIN: So that's why I said to you a little earlier,
###1357 I got a little eye raise even out of you, Joe.
###1359 You kind of have ice water in your veins about stuff.
###1361 But you even raised an eyebrow when I said they'd have to
###1363 re-institute the death penalty for fags.
###1365 That's what the Bible says.
