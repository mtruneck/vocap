1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,31



2
0:0:0,31 --> 0:0:5,19
-This is a story about a man.


3
0:0:5,19 --> 0:0:12,89
This is a story of random
violence and good times.


4
0:0:12,89 --> 0:0:14,31
ETHAN FOWLER: So I probably
got to talk loud, right?


5
0:0:14,31 --> 0:0:14,64
-Yeah.


6
0:0:14,64 --> 0:0:15,83
ETHAN FOWLER: OK.


7
0:0:15,83 --> 0:0:19,69
All right, well, like a couple
nights ago, the night before


8
0:0:19,69 --> 0:0:24,29
last, I went to The 500 Club
with a couple friends.


9
0:0:24,29 --> 0:0:26,93
And I just decided to
have a few drinks.


10
0:0:26,93 --> 0:0:28,41
It's a bar on Mission.


11
0:0:28,41 --> 0:0:34,22
And there, through I
don't know how or


12
0:0:34,22 --> 0:0:35,96
why, I met this girl.


13
0:0:35,96 --> 0:0:37,52
A friend of mine said, cut
the crap and why don't


14
0:0:37,52 --> 0:0:38,26
you just make out?


15
0:0:38,26 --> 0:0:40,72
So she says, all right
let's make out.


16
0:0:40,72 --> 0:0:41,72
So we make out.


17
0:0:41,72 --> 0:0:43,5
And we're making out and
everything's great.


18
0:0:43,5 --> 0:0:46,3
And we're hanging out
and drinking.


19
0:0:46,3 --> 0:0:49,92
She got pissed because
I saw this other


20
0:0:49,92 --> 0:0:51,13
girl and then we left.


21
0:0:51,13 --> 0:0:56,39
And the dudes pulled up and
fucking jumped out of the car.


22
0:0:56,39 --> 0:0:58,92
Next thing I know, I just was
getting socked in the face,


23
0:0:58,92 --> 0:1:1,7
looking at the guy like it's
not going to do me any good


24
0:1:1,7 --> 0:1:3,5
punching him.


25
0:1:3,5 --> 0:1:5,58
And I got socked a few times.


26
0:1:5,58 --> 0:1:6,8
I fell.


27
0:1:6,8 --> 0:1:8,293
I just covered my face and they
just kicked the shit out


28
0:1:8,293 --> 0:1:10,24
of me for a little while.


29
0:1:10,24 --> 0:1:14,86
It was good, though, because I
got to make out with a girl.


30
0:1:14,86 --> 0:1:16,11
I don't know.


31
0:1:16,11 --> 0:1:18,0



32
0:1:18,0 --> 0:1:19,45
It's getting purple.


33
0:1:19,45 --> 0:1:20,35
-OK.


34
0:1:20,35 --> 0:1:21,73
I'm going to fade it out.


35
0:1:21,73 --> 0:1:22,93
ETHAN FOWLER: OK.


36
0:1:22,93 --> 0:1:24,74
Fade.


37
0:1:24,74 --> 0:1:25,646
-Fade.


38
0:1:25,646 --> 0:1:27,2
ETHAN FOWLER: Fading fast.


39
0:1:27,2 --> 0:1:29,45
DAVE CARNIE: I don't really
remember how the whole living


40
0:1:29,45 --> 0:1:31,98
thing came up.


41
0:1:31,98 --> 0:1:33,57
I got an apartment
in the Mission.


42
0:1:33,57 --> 0:1:36,25
And he moved in with me.


43
0:1:36,25 --> 0:1:39,86
One day, went down to Guitar
Center and bought a little,


44
0:1:39,86 --> 0:1:43,61
white Fender guitar, one
of those $99 ones.


45
0:1:43,61 --> 0:1:46,1
And so that's what he'd do all
day when I'd go to work.


46
0:1:46,1 --> 0:1:47,71
Is he'd just sit there and just
noodle on the guitar.


47
0:1:47,71 --> 0:1:50,3
And every day I'd come home.


48
0:1:50,3 --> 0:1:53,63
He'd only been playing for
like a week or two.


49
0:1:53,63 --> 0:1:55,77
And I came home one day
and he had learned--


50
0:1:55,77 --> 0:1:57,43
he was like, Dave,
check this out.


51
0:1:57,43 --> 0:2:0,94
And he had learned an entire
Slayer song from start to


52
0:2:0,94 --> 0:2:2,68
finish in one day.


53
0:2:2,68 --> 0:2:7,51
Ethan's got just this
really weird talent.


54
0:2:7,51 --> 0:2:9,84
When he applies himself
to something, he's


55
0:2:9,84 --> 0:2:11,8
like the best at it.


56
0:2:11,8 --> 0:2:12,95
And he's completely natural,
kind of like how he skates.


57
0:2:12,95 --> 0:2:20,35



58
0:2:20,35 --> 0:2:21,645
ETHAN FOWLER: I was hanging
out with Chris a lot.


59
0:2:21,645 --> 0:2:24,7
And we were getting way
into this home brew


60
0:2:24,7 --> 0:2:27,36
recorded music and shit.


61
0:2:27,36 --> 0:2:31,66
The whole Guided By Voices
and Sebadoh deal.


62
0:2:31,66 --> 0:2:32,92
CHRIS PASTRAS: Totally.


63
0:2:32,92 --> 0:2:33,98
I didn't even mention that.


64
0:2:33,98 --> 0:2:37,2
Yeah, we were making music
primarily at the time.


65
0:2:37,2 --> 0:2:39,5
And so that was a huge
inspiration for us.


66
0:2:39,5 --> 0:2:41,22
Like we were just
like, fuck it.


67
0:2:41,22 --> 0:2:42,98
Let's Bucket Brothers it.


68
0:2:42,98 --> 0:2:46,11
Like that was our little
joke band.


69
0:2:46,11 --> 0:2:47,93
We were pressured
to make a video.


70
0:2:47,93 --> 0:2:49,44
And it was like the
winter time.


71
0:2:49,44 --> 0:2:50,96
It was like February.


72
0:2:50,96 --> 0:2:52,75
And there was all this pressure
to follow up "A


73
0:2:52,75 --> 0:2:56,79
Visual Sound." And Jason had
like just recently left, or


74
0:2:56,79 --> 0:2:58,29
told us he was leaving.


75
0:2:58,29 --> 0:3:0,68
And there was like a lot of
pressure there for people and


76
0:3:0,68 --> 0:3:2,83
he didn't really want to
film a video part.


77
0:3:2,83 --> 0:3:6,43
And instead of like combusting,
me and Ethan kind


78
0:3:6,43 --> 0:3:9,27
of looked at each other and were
like, let's just have fun


79
0:3:9,27 --> 0:3:10,12
and go skating.


80
0:3:10,12 --> 0:3:11,77
And put it out in a month.


81
0:3:11,77 --> 0:3:13,495
And just, like, make
the soundtrack.


82
0:3:13,495 --> 0:3:15,67
And drink beer.


83
0:3:15,67 --> 0:3:17,75
And bomb some hills.


84
0:3:17,75 --> 0:3:21,18
So, but I think people were
expecting another "Visual


85
0:3:21,18 --> 0:3:24,24
Sound," and that really bummed
them out-- some people.


86
0:3:24,24 --> 0:3:27,32
But I think like 5, 10 years
later, we all watch the video


87
0:3:27,32 --> 0:3:29,78
and my friends will be
like, dude, "Tincan


88
0:3:29,78 --> 0:3:31,51
Folklore" is rad.


89
0:3:31,51 --> 0:3:34,8
I used to say "Tincan Folklore"
was taped together


90
0:3:34,8 --> 0:3:36,95
with masking tape.


91
0:3:36,95 --> 0:3:38,57
Like, that's how we wanted
it to feel though.


92
0:3:38,57 --> 0:3:40,63
It's like so sketchy.


93
0:3:40,63 --> 0:3:44,9
We did the music ourselves and
filmed it in like a month.


94
0:3:44,9 --> 0:3:46,52
And it was just so budget.


95
0:3:46,52 --> 0:3:49,72
"A Visual Sound," we had
a goal and a vision.


96
0:3:49,72 --> 0:3:55,19
And we had something
really big to say.


97
0:3:55,19 --> 0:3:58,3
And with "Tincan Folklore,"
we had something to say.


98
0:3:58,3 --> 0:4:0,1
It was just was not as big.


99
0:4:0,1 --> 0:4:2,1
It was more just like,
hey, this is fun.


100
0:4:2,1 --> 0:4:3,28
This is skateboarding.


101
0:4:3,28 --> 0:4:4,89
Here's us putting out a video.


102
0:4:4,89 --> 0:4:7,26
It was more messy.


103
0:4:7,26 --> 0:4:10,16
ETHAN FOWLER: And so that was
kind of a whole basis of that,


104
0:4:10,16 --> 0:4:18,209
like a four track skate video
as represented in my part.


105
0:4:18,209 --> 0:4:22,42
Which is me, and Carnie, and
Sean Young just drunk off our


106
0:4:22,42 --> 0:4:24,603
asses at 3:00 in the afternoon,
playing the "Wizard


107
0:4:24,603 --> 0:4:25,853
of Oz" theme.


108
0:4:25,853 --> 0:4:43,2



109
0:4:43,2 --> 0:4:45,23
CHRIS PASTRAS: To me, the things
that got me stoked on


110
0:4:45,23 --> 0:4:47,57
skateboarding are things that
make me want to ride my


111
0:4:47,57 --> 0:4:48,34
skateboard.


112
0:4:48,34 --> 0:4:52,14
And I always kind of felt like,
to me it's more of the


113
0:4:52,14 --> 0:4:54,74
character behind it and the
personalities, and their


114
0:4:54,74 --> 0:4:57,63
style, and the way they carry
themselves on a board.


115
0:4:57,63 --> 0:5:0,735
Gets me way more stoked than
technical videos that are


116
0:5:0,735 --> 0:5:1,985
competitive.


117
0:5:1,985 --> 0:5:7,0



118
0:5:7,0 --> 0:5:8,6
It's interesting, though.


119
0:5:8,6 --> 0:5:13,31
The thing I always liked about
Anti Hero and Stereo was that


120
0:5:13,31 --> 0:5:13,83
very thing.


121
0:5:13,83 --> 0:5:17,12
That people would come up to me
in bars and be like, dude,


122
0:5:17,12 --> 0:5:21,9
Stereo videos, or the Deluxe
videos, or Anti Hero videos.


123
0:5:21,9 --> 0:5:23,59
They were so stoked because it
made them want to skate.


124
0:5:23,59 --> 0:5:24,73
And it made them--


125
0:5:24,73 --> 0:5:27,4
I think Eastern Exposure videos
and some of those


126
0:5:27,4 --> 0:5:28,47
videos did the same thing.


127
0:5:28,47 --> 0:5:32,28
Like, anybody who's sitting on
their couch can get up and be


128
0:5:32,28 --> 0:5:35,1
like, dude, Bobby Puleo found
these amazing spots.


129
0:5:35,1 --> 0:5:38,48
Or man, Ethan Fowler's
got such good style.


130
0:5:38,48 --> 0:5:40,505
And, like, go skate their
town hand rail.


131
0:5:40,505 --> 0:5:43,2



132
0:5:43,2 --> 0:5:45,62
ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah, it wasn't
supposed to be perfect.


133
0:5:45,62 --> 0:5:47,86
I think it's interesting
to watch.


134
0:5:47,86 --> 0:5:50,13
CHRIS PASTRAS: We felt it in
the air when Stereo started


135
0:5:50,13 --> 0:5:51,88
and was going to be on fire.


136
0:5:51,88 --> 0:5:53,9
And you felt it in the
air when its time


137
0:5:53,9 --> 0:5:55,2
was over with Deluxe.


138
0:5:55,2 --> 0:5:57,38
I was 19 when we
started Stereo.


139
0:5:57,38 --> 0:6:0,61
So by the time we hit "Tincan
Folklore," I thought I was


140
0:6:0,61 --> 0:6:1,19
over the hill.


141
0:6:1,19 --> 0:6:3,58
I was like 24.


142
0:6:3,58 --> 0:6:5,12
Everything has its time, man.


143
0:6:5,12 --> 0:6:7,86
I think it couldn't have
kept going like it was.


144
0:6:7,86 --> 0:6:8,74
It's like too rad.


145
0:6:8,74 --> 0:6:12,0
Anything that hits that
high of a point


146
0:6:12,0 --> 0:6:13,65
is bound to go down.


147
0:6:13,65 --> 0:6:15,245
And I don't really
even remember.


148
0:6:15,245 --> 0:6:16,39
I'm trying to think.


149
0:6:16,39 --> 0:6:18,39
I think he left for
Foundation.


150
0:6:18,39 --> 0:6:22,2
There was this whole thing with
Mic-E punching Tod Swank


151
0:6:22,2 --> 0:6:25,45
at the ASR trade show.


152
0:6:25,45 --> 0:6:26,81
TOD SWANK: Mic-E Reyes
was really bummed.


153
0:6:26,81 --> 0:6:29,55
The whole Deluxe guys
were really bummed.


154
0:6:29,55 --> 0:6:32,58
They were telling everybody that
we totally like stole him


155
0:6:32,58 --> 0:6:34,68
from those guys.


156
0:6:34,68 --> 0:6:36,73
At that trade show, hanging
out with Mic-E Reyes, and


157
0:6:36,73 --> 0:6:39,45
Mic-E Reyes has got his
arm around Josh being


158
0:6:39,45 --> 0:6:40,62
all like bros, fun.


159
0:6:40,62 --> 0:6:41,24
Hey, you know.


160
0:6:41,24 --> 0:6:41,55
Hey.


161
0:6:41,55 --> 0:6:43,97
And then he'd just
be like, kick.


162
0:6:43,97 --> 0:6:44,43
Whatever.


163
0:6:44,43 --> 0:6:45,965
I was sitting there talking
to somebody.


164
0:6:45,965 --> 0:6:47,12
And Moishe comes up.


165
0:6:47,12 --> 0:6:48,473
He's all, hey, Tod.


166
0:6:48,473 --> 0:6:48,665
How's it going?


167
0:6:48,665 --> 0:6:49,83
What's up and stuff?


168
0:6:49,83 --> 0:6:52,76
I'm all kind of flinchy
because Mic-E's


169
0:6:52,76 --> 0:6:55,35
lurking around and stuff.


170
0:6:55,35 --> 0:6:56,75
And he's all, what, dude?


171
0:6:56,75 --> 0:6:58,91
Did you think I was going to
punch you or something?


172
0:6:58,91 --> 0:6:59,84
And I'm all, no.


173
0:6:59,84 --> 0:7:1,99
And he was like, phew.


174
0:7:1,99 --> 0:7:3,39
Punched me in the stomach.


175
0:7:3,39 --> 0:7:4,63
Doubled over.


176
0:7:4,63 --> 0:7:7,88
Mic-E Reyes paid him $100 to
come punch me in the stomach.


177
0:7:7,88 --> 0:7:10,52
And I was the guy that called
those guys to forewarn them.


178
0:7:10,52 --> 0:7:13,25
And go, look, you guys need to
take care of your business


179
0:7:13,25 --> 0:7:15,6
because your guy's not
happy and stuff.


180
0:7:15,6 --> 0:7:16,819
And that's what we got.


181
0:7:16,819 --> 0:7:17,817
CHRIS PASTRAS: [INAUDIBLE],
man.


182
0:7:17,817 --> 0:7:19,314
Fuck!


183
0:7:19,314 --> 0:7:20,811
Fuck, man!


184
0:7:20,811 --> 0:7:21,81
Fuck!


185
0:7:21,81 --> 0:7:23,88
ETHAN FOWLER: Let's
put it this way.


186
0:7:23,88 --> 0:7:27,51
Getting on Stereo was like an
extension of my skateboarding


187
0:7:27,51 --> 0:7:29,61
ethic to begin with.


188
0:7:29,61 --> 0:7:32,39
I never thought that, like, I
need to go to this thing to do


189
0:7:32,39 --> 0:7:35,36
this specific thing because
that's the thing to do--


190
0:7:35,36 --> 0:7:35,72
ever.


191
0:7:35,72 --> 0:7:38,7
And I still don't,
and I never will.


192
0:7:38,7 --> 0:7:42,11
And being around people that do
that kind of thing, if I'm


193
0:7:42,11 --> 0:7:44,335
interested in it, I'll do it.


194
0:7:44,335 --> 0:7:45,8
If I'm not, I won't.


195
0:7:45,8 --> 0:7:48,624
The Foundation dudes
offered up.


196
0:7:48,624 --> 0:7:52,36
Well, those are guys that are
actually out there skating,


197
0:7:52,36 --> 0:7:53,58
doing their thing.


198
0:7:53,58 --> 0:7:54,22
I get along with them.


199
0:7:54,22 --> 0:7:56,62
So, all right, I'll do that.


200
0:7:56,62 --> 0:7:59,16
TOD SWANK: I think he was our
longest ever team rider on


201
0:7:59,16 --> 0:8:0,43
Foundation.


202
0:8:0,43 --> 0:8:3,27
I think 10 years he rode for
us straight through.


203
0:8:3,27 --> 0:8:8,23
And super solid and obviously an
amazing skateboarder with a


204
0:8:8,23 --> 0:8:10,5
great style and super--


205
0:8:10,5 --> 0:8:12,14
people are just always
hyped on him.


206
0:8:12,14 --> 0:8:18,21
And he was a powerful and smooth
skateboarder for sure.


207
0:8:18,21 --> 0:8:21,2
ETHAN FOWLER: Foundation
was the rail team.


208
0:8:21,2 --> 0:8:25,8
And so, it was get the dudes
who bust the big rails.


209
0:8:25,8 --> 0:8:29,84
And they were amazing
skaters, still are.


210
0:8:29,84 --> 0:8:33,73
And just like being around that
was all cool looking.


211
0:8:33,73 --> 0:8:35,15
It got me excited.


212
0:8:35,15 --> 0:8:35,48
-Yeah.


213
0:8:35,48 --> 0:8:36,3
ETHAN FOWLER: Lack
of motivation.


214
0:8:36,3 --> 0:8:37,94
-If you'd stayed on Stereo, it
would have been like, whoop,


215
0:8:37,94 --> 0:8:39,26
retirement part.


216
0:8:39,26 --> 0:8:40,87
ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah,
at 19, that's


217
0:8:40,87 --> 0:8:42,281
probably not a good idea.


218
0:8:42,281 --> 0:8:53,12



219
0:8:53,12 --> 0:8:56,436
I mean, you've got to be around
motivated people or be


220
0:8:56,436 --> 0:8:58,28
motivated just for
a little while.


221
0:8:58,28 --> 0:9:2,13



222
0:9:2,13 --> 0:9:5,0
TOD SWANK: He always had fun
ideas and would come and work


223
0:9:5,0 --> 0:9:11,0
on crazy graphics that people
would either love or hate.


224
0:9:11,0 --> 0:9:13,3
The sales people would
hate them.


225
0:9:13,3 --> 0:9:14,7
I can't sell them, or
something like that.


226
0:9:14,7 --> 0:9:16,24
Because it's just too
crazy, or something.


227
0:9:16,24 --> 0:9:21,72



228
0:9:21,72 --> 0:9:24,88
ETHAN FOWLER: Talk
about stick.


229
0:9:24,88 --> 0:9:25,62
Ow!


230
0:9:25,62 --> 0:9:27,15
That was my body.


231
0:9:27,15 --> 0:9:29,45
DAVE CARNIE: It's always weird
to me to see someone skating


232
0:9:29,45 --> 0:9:31,69
who's not dressed for skating.


233
0:9:31,69 --> 0:9:34,27
And Ethan definitely now--


234
0:9:34,27 --> 0:9:37,69
it looks like he should be
picking up a guitar and not a


235
0:9:37,69 --> 0:9:38,42
skateboard.


236
0:9:38,42 --> 0:9:42,4
Just there's a weird kind of
visual disconnect to me, but


237
0:9:42,4 --> 0:9:45,65
he's still that amazing skater
that he always was.


238
0:9:45,65 --> 0:9:48,7
TOD SWANK: I think it was
last part in the last


239
0:9:48,7 --> 0:9:49,7
video that we did.


240
0:9:49,7 --> 0:9:53,57
And there was a debate whether
he should have last part or


241
0:9:53,57 --> 0:9:55,12
Corey should have last part.


242
0:9:55,12 --> 0:9:55,97
ETHAN FOWLER: Man, I tell you.


243
0:9:55,97 --> 0:9:58,19
These kids these days,
they hated that.


244
0:9:58,19 --> 0:9:58,78
-Really?


245
0:9:58,78 --> 0:9:59,665
ETHAN FOWLER: Oh, yeah.


246
0:9:59,665 --> 0:10:0,74
It's great.


247
0:10:0,74 --> 0:10:1,552
I love it.


248
0:10:1,552 --> 0:10:2,7
-They were like, why doesn't
Corey Duffel


249
0:10:2,7 --> 0:10:3,79
have the last part?


250
0:10:3,79 --> 0:10:6,3
ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah, exactly.


251
0:10:6,3 --> 0:10:9,27
I had brought it up as a joke,
just to see what would happen,


252
0:10:9,27 --> 0:10:12,55
like the company response.


253
0:10:12,55 --> 0:10:17,86
Well, it's been a while I've
been on this team.


254
0:10:17,86 --> 0:10:20,84
What say you just chuck
it at the end there?


255
0:10:20,84 --> 0:10:22,85
And then it caused this
like, oh, jeez.


256
0:10:22,85 --> 0:10:23,37
I don't know.


257
0:10:23,37 --> 0:10:25,96
You know, big interoffice memos
and call the skaters.


258
0:10:25,96 --> 0:10:28,11
Hey, is that all right
if Grandpa Ethan


259
0:10:28,11 --> 0:10:30,425
gets the last part?


260
0:10:30,425 --> 0:10:35,635
And so it was just kind of
funny to even have that.


261
0:10:35,635 --> 0:10:38,22
I mean, it wasn't an ego trip.


262
0:10:38,22 --> 0:10:39,5
It was the opposite.


263
0:10:39,5 --> 0:10:42,17
It was like, dude, let's
see what happens.


264
0:10:42,17 --> 0:10:44,23
I want to see what happens
if this even happens.


265
0:10:44,23 --> 0:10:48,82
And it's great because there
was so much shit talking.


266
0:10:48,82 --> 0:10:50,59
Oh, that part sucked.


267
0:10:50,59 --> 0:10:51,54
That dude sucks.


268
0:10:51,54 --> 0:10:53,27
It's probably his
retirement part.


269
0:10:53,27 --> 0:10:56,3



270
0:10:56,3 --> 0:10:57,82
I love hearing shit like that.


271
0:10:57,82 --> 0:11:1,3



272
0:11:1,3 --> 0:11:5,39
-Do you have any stuff
we can look at?


273
0:11:5,39 --> 0:11:8,47
ETHAN FOWLER: I have
lots of stuff.


274
0:11:8,47 --> 0:11:9,72
There's the studio.


275
0:11:9,72 --> 0:11:13,83



276
0:11:13,83 --> 0:11:15,79
That's the guitar.


277
0:11:15,79 --> 0:11:17,72
-Damn, that's a big stack.


278
0:11:17,72 --> 0:11:19,25
ETHAN FOWLER: It's a stack.


279
0:11:19,25 --> 0:11:21,2
It's bigger now.


280
0:11:21,2 --> 0:11:25,49
There's me in my Bill Murray
whiskey advertisement pose.


281
0:11:25,49 --> 0:11:27,96
-You have any skate related
stuff, like


282
0:11:27,96 --> 0:11:29,51
say a stereo board?


283
0:11:29,51 --> 0:11:31,56
ETHAN FOWLER: Uh-uh.


284
0:11:31,56 --> 0:11:32,81
I got nothing like that.


285
0:11:32,81 --> 0:11:34,48
I have the new ones.


286
0:11:34,48 --> 0:11:38,68
I got trippy keyboard and
some ancient amplifiers.


287
0:11:38,68 --> 0:11:39,94
-Do you have a Bummer
High board?


288
0:11:39,94 --> 0:11:41,55
ETHAN FOWLER: I have that.


289
0:11:41,55 --> 0:11:42,8
And that's the bus.


290
0:11:42,8 --> 0:11:45,59



291
0:11:45,59 --> 0:11:48,96
So there's that one and this
one's got a dragon on it.


292
0:11:48,96 --> 0:11:51,94
It's like a sweet warrior
dude down there.


293
0:11:51,94 --> 0:11:53,92
He's going to face the
giant blue dragon.


294
0:11:53,92 --> 0:11:56,54
-So what's Bummer High?


295
0:11:56,54 --> 0:11:57,53
ETHAN FOWLER: I don't know.


296
0:11:57,53 --> 0:12:0,26
It's just an extension
of my ethic.


297
0:12:0,26 --> 0:12:2,46
You ever just get really stoned,
and you're having a


298
0:12:2,46 --> 0:12:5,45
great time, and someone
comes up, and just


299
0:12:5,45 --> 0:12:6,7
completely blows it?


300
0:12:6,7 --> 0:12:9,16



301
0:12:9,16 --> 0:12:10,736
This is dedicated to
all those jerks.


302
0:12:10,736 --> 0:12:17,67



303
0:12:17,67 --> 0:12:20,19
Bummer High is my love
for evil music.


304
0:12:20,19 --> 0:12:23,975
It's about getting stomped
on for just being the


305
0:12:23,975 --> 0:12:25,3
dude that you are.


306
0:12:25,3 --> 0:12:30,98
I want it to be how I see it.


307
0:12:30,98 --> 0:12:33,6
And that's not an egotistical
thing.


308
0:12:33,6 --> 0:12:35,69
It's not driven by that.


309
0:12:35,69 --> 0:12:39,98
It's just I think it's a good
way to go about things.


310
0:12:39,98 --> 0:12:42,8
It's a lot less stressful.


311
0:12:42,8 --> 0:12:43,86
You do what you want.


312
0:12:43,86 --> 0:12:45,16
You do it well.


313
0:12:45,16 --> 0:12:48,16
Or if you don't want to do it
well, don't do it well.


314
0:12:48,16 --> 0:12:50,28
Just do it how you do it.


315
0:12:50,28 --> 0:12:55,702
And that shit shines through
a thousand times brighter.


316
0:12:55,702 --> 0:13:9,2



317
0:13:9,2 --> 0:13:11,29
DAVE CARNIE: Any kid who gets
into skating and wants to be


318
0:13:11,29 --> 0:13:16,9
pro or sponsored to be in the
industry doesn't realize how


319
0:13:16,9 --> 0:13:20,97
you're completely fucking up
what you used to enjoy doing


320
0:13:20,97 --> 0:13:23,8
by yourself and with
your friends.


321
0:13:23,8 --> 0:13:24,69
It happens to most skaters.


322
0:13:24,69 --> 0:13:25,4
I mean, there's a few.


323
0:13:25,4 --> 0:13:28,75
Like Ethan's one who didn't
allow himself to get wrapped


324
0:13:28,75 --> 0:13:31,675
up in the, quote unquote,
"industry." He


325
0:13:31,675 --> 0:13:33,22
just did what he wanted.


326
0:13:33,22 --> 0:13:37,45
And fortunately for him, what he
does is so good that people


327
0:13:37,45 --> 0:13:40,2
can't help but have to
pay attention to it.


328
0:13:40,2 --> 0:13:44,9
Yeah, he's always wanted
to do Bummer High.


329
0:13:44,9 --> 0:13:46,64
He's been talking about
that for years.


330
0:13:46,64 --> 0:13:50,93
Yeah, I don't think Ethan knows
much about what's going


331
0:13:50,93 --> 0:13:53,92
on in skateboarding, which
is kind of the


332
0:13:53,92 --> 0:13:55,521
beauty of it, I guess.


333
0:13:55,521 --> 0:13:57,726
ETHAN FOWLER: Nah.


334
0:13:57,726 --> 0:14:0,11
-Yeah, Spanky was telling me
that you don't know who a lot


335
0:14:0,11 --> 0:14:0,9
of the skaters are.


336
0:14:0,9 --> 0:14:3,587
He's always like, yeah, Ethan
doesn't know much about the--


337
0:14:3,587 --> 0:14:5,2
ETHAN FOWLER: Not really.


338
0:14:5,2 --> 0:14:10,63
I mean, just some dudes
that peak my interest.


339
0:14:10,63 --> 0:14:12,47
-I heard something the other
day, that Josh Harmony


340
0:14:12,47 --> 0:14:16,32
believes that Satan buried
the dinosaur bones.


341
0:14:16,32 --> 0:14:17,36
ETHAN FOWLER: Oh, does he now?


342
0:14:17,36 --> 0:14:18,86
-Yeah.


343
0:14:18,86 --> 0:14:19,79
ETHAN FOWLER: Oof!


344
0:14:19,79 --> 0:14:20,93
-Then you know what?


345
0:14:20,93 --> 0:14:21,45
ETHAN FOWLER: That's
interesting.


346
0:14:21,45 --> 0:14:22,83
-At first, I thought that
was ridiculous.


347
0:14:22,83 --> 0:14:25,66
And then the more I think about
it, I'm like, I want to


348
0:14:25,66 --> 0:14:26,0
start thinking that, too.


349
0:14:26,0 --> 0:14:27,86
ETHAN FOWLER: I'm mean, that
would be cool because I'd like


350
0:14:27,86 --> 0:14:31,981
to see a physical incarnation
of Satan.


351
0:14:31,981 --> 0:14:33,63
That would be pretty sweet.


352
0:14:33,63 --> 0:14:37,67
Because he's probably got a
lot of shit to talk about,


353
0:14:37,67 --> 0:14:39,62
getting kicked out of
heaven and all.


354
0:14:39,62 --> 0:14:43,63
I mean, it'd be pretty
cool to hang out.


355
0:14:43,63 --> 0:14:45,6
-Watch Satan bury
dinosaur bones?


356
0:14:45,6 --> 0:14:47,267
ETHAN FOWLER: We can bury
something before


357
0:14:47,267 --> 0:14:50,2
the tape runs out.


358
0:14:50,2 --> 0:14:56,28
Maybe, like, in future times,
people will think that God


359
0:14:56,28 --> 0:14:58,57
buried this.


360
0:14:58,57 --> 0:14:59,82
OK.


361
0:14:59,82 --> 0:15:1,64



362
0:15:1,64 --> 0:15:2,89
It's time.


363
0:15:2,89 --> 0:15:6,64



364
0:15:6,64 --> 0:15:12,62
And then, see, maybe they'll
think Satan buried that and


365
0:15:12,62 --> 0:15:14,52
that there was no such
thing as computers.


366
0:15:14,52 --> 0:15:25,72



367
0:15:25,72 --> 0:15:26,42
Whatever.


368
0:15:26,42 --> 0:15:29,45
There it is.


369
0:15:29,45 --> 0:15:32,74
Rest well, sweet prince.


370
0:15:32,74 --> 0:15:35,51
Served well.


371
0:15:35,51 --> 0:15:37,22
There's your fucking "SLAP"
forum right there.


372
0:15:37,22 --> 0:15:39,93



373
0:15:39,93 --> 0:15:41,18
Finished.


374
0:15:41,18 --> 0:15:43,8



375
0:15:43,8 --> 0:15:43,86
Oh, watch out.


376
0:15:43,86 --> 0:15:44,93
Shooting range.


377
0:15:44,93 --> 0:15:45,74
-Whoa.


378
0:15:45,74 --> 0:15:49,74
ETHAN FOWLER: You're going to
trip over the invisible line.


379
0:15:49,74 --> 0:15:49,81
-What?


380
0:15:49,81 --> 0:15:50,57
You got guns?


381
0:15:50,57 --> 0:15:53,54
ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah,
a little BB gun.


382
0:15:53,54 --> 0:15:57,11
Come out here and blast
away at the cans.


383
0:15:57,11 --> 0:15:58,9
It's fun.


384
0:15:58,9 --> 0:15:59,32
-Damn.


385
0:15:59,32 --> 0:15:59,47
ETHAN FOWLER: Yeah.


386
0:15:59,47 --> 0:16:0,82
-That's pretty cool.


387
0:16:0,82 --> 0:18:0,82
