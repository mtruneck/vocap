THOMAS MORTON: A month after
Ze Claudio and his wife,


16

Maria, were murdered,
we flew to Brazil


17
0:2:48,8 --> 0:2:50,12
to meet their relatives.


18
0:2:50,12 --> 0:2:52,98
Our first stop was Maraba,
a small city in


19
0:2:52,98 --> 0:2:54,23
the state of Para.


20
0:2:54,23 --> 0:2:57,77

0:2:57,77 --> 0:2:58,67
We just landed in Maraba.


22
0:2:58,67 --> 0:3:1,55
It's right, kind of on the
edge of the Amazon.


23
0:3:1,55 --> 0:3:3,99
It's known for it's cattle
ranching, production of


24
0:3:3,99 --> 0:3:7,21
pig-iron from charcoal, and
for being one of the most


25
0:3:7,21 --> 0:3:10,74
violent, lawless places
in all of Brazil.


26
0:3:10,74 --> 0:3:13,285
Maraba is sometimes called
Marabala, which means lot of


27
0:3:13,285 --> 0:3:15,96
bullets because it's
kind of like the OK


28

THOMAS MORTON: We traveled to
Maraba with Felipe Milanez, a


31
0:3:31,45 --> 0:3:33,87
Brazilian journalist who
covers the Amazon.


32
0:3:33,87 --> 0:3:35,68
Until recently, Felipe
was the editor of


33
0:3:35,68 --> 0:3:37,42
National Geographic Brazil.


34
0:3:37,42 --> 0:3:39,63
But he got fired after publicly
criticizing another


35
0:3:39,63 --> 0:3:42,31
magazine owned by the same
company who printed a bogus


36
0:3:42,31 --> 0:3:45,5
article about Indians.


37
0:3:45,5 --> 0:3:47,1
Felipe met Ze Claudio and Maria
a few months before


38
0:3:47,1 --> 0:3:49,1
their death and shot an
interview with them outside


39
0:3:49,1 --> 0:3:50,12
their house.


40
0:3:50,12 --> 0:3:52,93
They became friends and Felipe
has continued to cover their

42
0:3:54,18 --> 0:3:58,16

We're heading across the river

up in the same farm settlement


55
0:5:44,75 --> 0:5:46,89
where Ze Claudio and Maria
lived, a couple


56
0:5:46,89 --> 0:5:48,94
hours north of Maraba.


57
0:5:48,94 --> 0:5:50,84
Since the murder, she's
decided to move to a

Claudio and Maria lived.


62
0:5:59,9 --> 0:6:2,87
Maria's sister, Laisa, lived
there too, but she has also


63
0:6:2,87 --> 0:6:5,97
moved to Maraba because of
the safety situation.


64
0:6:5,97 --> 0:6:7,91
However, she had to go to her
house to pick up some of her


65
0:6:7,91 --> 0:6:8,54
belongings.


66
0:6:8,54 --> 0:6:10,591
So we drove up there
to meet her.

0:6:10,591 --> 0:6:13,26

69
0:6:15,68 --> 0:6:19,41

This is the road actually that
they were killed on.


71
0:6:22,81 --> 0:6:26,906
And it's a kind of scary road if
you think about it in terms


72
0:6:26,906 --> 0:6:29,46

73
0:6:29,46 --> 0:6:33,44
You have to slow to basically a

There's still food

There's still nuts rotting

a little

the nuts on, a small press,

come to think of the

environmental issue, the heart


136
0:13:26,77 --> 0:13:29,67
of the violence in the Amazon
is land reform.


137

The real conflict here isn't so
much between man and nature


138

as it is between
rich and poor.


139
0:13:35,464 --> 0:13:38,56
Since Brazil became a democracy

1,700 land activists
and community

organized by the Landless
Workers Movement, or MST, one


165
0:15:34,45 --> 0:15:38,15
of the largest social
movements in Brazil.

THOMAS MORTON: We're at
an MST encampment.


170
0:16:17,79 --> 0:16:20,97
All this land is owned by some
rich guy who basically doesn't


171
0:16:20,97 --> 0:16:21,67
take care of the land.


172
0:16:21,67 --> 0:16:22,97
It's all overgrown.


173
0:16:22,97 --> 0:16:24,71
And so what the Landless
Movement does is they take


174
0:16:24,71 --> 0:16:28,13
farmers who don't have any land
and they move in and set


175
0:16:28,13 --> 0:16:30,45
up a little village like this
that they have to guard.


176
0:16:30,45 --> 0:16:32,24
And it's basically, like,
there's no such thing as


177
0:16:32,24 --> 0:16:33,48
squatters rights in Brazil.


178
0:16:33,48 --> 0:16:33,95
It's not in the law.

But that's the principal
they're using.


180
0:16:35,415 --> 0:16:38,5

the juntas set out to

boost Brazil's economy by
conquering the Amazon, which


196
0:18:0,53 --> 0:18:3,22
brought the land conflict
into the rainforest.


197
0:18:3,22 --> 0:18:5,53
They created a program like the
American Homesteading Act


198
0:18:5,53 --> 0:18:8,0
where settlers were given big
chunks of land provided they


199

THOMAS MORTON: The dictatorship

0:18:53,82 --> 0:18:56,25
As Brazil transitioned into
democracy, social movements


207
0:18:56,25 --> 0:18:58,99
like MST pushed for a long
overdue land reform.


208
0:18:58,99 --> 0:19:1,74
They were thwarted, however, by
a powerful political block


209
0:19:1,74 --> 0:19:4,35
of cattle ranchers, land owners,
and loggers known as


210
0:19:4,35 --> 0:19:8,14
the "ruralistas."

[SINGING IN PORTUGUESE]

THOMAS MORTON: As MST led the

the '80s, the fight to protect
the rainforest also gained


214

movement under the leadership
of Chico Mendes.


215
0:19:20,42 --> 0:19:23,2
Chico was a rubber tapper from
the state of Acre who became a


216
0:19:23,2 --> 0:19:24,98
union leader and from there
was thrust into


217
0:19:24,98 --> 0:19:27,27
environmental activism.


218
0:19:27,27 --> 0:19:29,8
He fought for the creation of
extractive reserves, which are


219
0:19:29,8 --> 0:19:31,9
sections of rainforest like
Ze Claudio and Maria's


220

from development exclusively


221

for the use of people who make
their living off the forest.


222
0:19:39,7 --> 0:19:41,13
After rising to international
attention, Chico


223
0:19:41,13 --> 0:19:42,95
called his own death.


224
0:19:42,95 --> 0:19:44,64

THOMAS MORTON: When we think of
the rainforest in America,


239
0:20:54,92 --> 0:20:59,2
it's kind of a very effete,

241
0:20:59,98 --> 0:21:2,48
But down here, it sums up
everything that's been going


242
0:21:2,48 --> 0:21:3,65
on with Brazil for a while.


243
0:21:3,65 --> 0:21:6,12
It's about issues of
land ownership.

It's also about the environment

it'll have.

0:21:10,14 --> 0:21:12,77
And it's about the economy.


247
0:21:12,77 --> 0:21:13,62
Right now we're in Belem.


248
0:21:13,62 --> 0:21:15,32
It's the capital of Para,
which is the state


249
0:21:15,32 --> 0:21:16,48
that Maraba is in.


250
0:21:16,48 --> 0:21:19,69
It's sort of at the mouth
of the Amazon.


251
0:21:19,69 --> 0:21:21,46
We're going to go to the
offices of Imazon.


252
0:21:21,46 --> 0:21:24,4
They're a private research group
who tracks the effects


253
0:21:24,4 --> 0:21:25,66
of deforestation.


254
0:21:25,66 --> 0:21:28,72
So hopefully we'll get kind of a
general overview so we don't


255
0:21:28,72 --> 0:21:30,86
have to rely on Sting

256

the map of the Amazon.

0:21:35,32 --> 0:21:39,3
It shows deforestation in red.


259
0:21:39,3 --> 0:21:42,1
This is called the "arc of
deforestation." This is where


260
0:21:42,1 --> 0:21:43,41
most of the forestation is.


261
0:21:43,41 --> 0:21:47,82
Nowadays, about 17%
is the forest.


262
0:21:47,82 --> 0:21:50,49
THOMAS MORTON: So it's
at 17% deforestation


263
0:21:50,49 --> 0:21:51,2
basically right now.


264
0:21:51,2 --> 0:21:52,31
How quickly has that happened?


265
0:21:52,31 --> 0:21:53,93
Has that been since the 1900s?


266
0:21:53,93 --> 0:21:58,16
Or has most of it been in
the last 20 or 30 years?


267
0:21:58,16 --> 0:21:58,46
PAULO BARRETO: Yeah.

In the last 30 years.

THOMAS MORTON: How much
can the forest take?


270
0:22:1,49 --> 0:22:3,21
There's got to be a
level at which you


271
0:22:3,21 --> 0:22:4,68
basically kill it, right?


272
0:22:4,68 --> 0:22:6,65
At which the forest starts
to collapse?


273
0:22:6,65 --> 0:22:7,94
When does that happen?


274
0:22:7,94 --> 0:22:11,2
PAULO BARRETO: If you have more
than 30% deforestation,


275
0:22:11,2 --> 0:22:16,19
then you have a huge risk of
larger areas of the Amazon


276
0:22:16,19 --> 0:22:19,84
becoming more like a
savanna-type vegetation.

current rate, how


278

You see them all over the

0:26:43,9 --> 0:26:44,41
This is COSIPAR.


345
0:26:44,41 --> 0:26:48,72
It's one of the companies in
Maraba that makes pig-iron,


346
0:26:48,72 --> 0:26:50,3
which is a component in steel.


347
0:26:50,3 --> 0:26:53,19
And it's actually, like,
Amazonian pig-iron is used in


348
0:26:53,19 --> 0:26:56,2
a lot of US steel and US
products that involve steel,


349
0:26:56,2 --> 0:26:58,98
like the car industry.


350
0:26:58,98 --> 0:27:1,76
A lot of the charcoal used by
the pig-iron plants isn't just


351
0:27:1,76 --> 0:27:3,0
from illegal wood.


352
0:27:3,0 --> 0:27:5,47
It's also made by slave labor.


353
0:27:5,47 --> 0:27:8,41
Actually, slavery is a really
big problem in all of Brazil.


354
0:27:8,41 --> 0:27:10,36
Cattle farms, illegal
sawmills, even


355
0:27:10,36 --> 0:27:12,37
factories use slaves.


356
0:27:12,37 --> 0:27:13,8
Nobody is bought and
sold outright.


357
0:27:13,8 --> 0:27:16,1
But what happens is poor workers
get recruited for jobs


358
0:27:16,1 --> 0:27:19,23
far away from home, then charged
their entire wages


359
0:27:19,23 --> 0:27:20,656
just for food and lodging.

working for free and often in
