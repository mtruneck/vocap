###17 PATRICK O'DELL: We need an intro.
###19 JAVIER NUNEZ: An intro?
###20 All right.
###22 It's Javier Nunez, aka Hands.
###28 And we're going to go inside the store talk about Menace.
###31 Good old Menace days that a lot of
###34 people have yet to hear.
###36 All right.
###38 Come on guys.
###39 Let's talk.
###41 PATRICK O'DELL: Where are you from?
###42 JAVIER NUNEZ: Bayonne, New Jersey.
###44 PATRICK O'DELL: How far is that?
###47 JAVIER NUNEZ: Well, when you take the bus and train, it
###49 took me about an hour.
###51 I be in sixth grade, seventh grade, after school I go to
###54 New York by myself.
###55 I'll just be out.
###56 I'm like, I'm not chilling in Jersey.
###58 I'll go to New York and meet my other friends, skating in
###61 the skate side.
###62 My name is Javier Nunez.
###64 I've been skating for a year and a half.
###67 I'm age 11.
###69 The most place I like to skate is the banks.
###72 The "Wheels of Fortune," was just I was skating the banks,
###75 and Pepe Martinez was up there with his filmer from DC.
###79 I believe his name was Dave Schubert.
###81 And fuck yeah, he just saw me skating the banks.
###84 Pretty much all those tricks that he filmed me
###86 do, I really did.
###87 And he was like, dude, let's film that again, and get you a
###90 little thing on this "411 Magazine."
###92 Let's interview you.
###93 I'm like, all right, cool.
###94 And then that was all filmed in 15, 20 minutes.
###98 PATRICK O'DELL: The whole part?
###98 JAVIER NUNEZ: The whole part.
###99 Yeah, it was quick.
###100 It wasn't that long.
###102 STEVIE WILLIAMS: 411 days, he was the fucking little Spanish
###107 dude skating at the banks.
###110 And I was the black kid from Philly.
###114 He skated for Dead End, and I skated for Element.
###118 He would come down to Philly, stay at my house, hang with
###122 the homies, skate.
###124 And you know my mom, we got so many crazy little kid stories
###129 in my house that me and him will forever, forever, forever
###135 be friends.
###136 JAVIER NUNEZ: I know you obviously
###137 saw this book already.
###139 Scoops--
###141 pretty much what we're talking about, that whole era.
###144 
###147 See, that was actually me right here when
###149 I was on Dead End.
###151 Before Zoo York, that was my hat.
###154 And then we have me skating through Manhattan.
###158 This whole book, Ari Marcopoulos shot.
###160 He told me to this day, Jav, I remember you being young and
###163 cursing me out, telling your friends, why is this old man
###165 following us for the photos?
###167 Obviously, I got mad a little for it.
###169 But yeah, he tells me that every time.
###171 You're cursing me out when you were 12 years old.
###173 And I told him I'm sorry Ari, but that was when I was young.
###176 I didn't know no better.
###178 That's the whole crew.
###180 That's pretty much the crew you be skating with.
###183 You can see in this photo, Harold Hunter just being
###187 himself, snapping on somebody.
###189 And then look, he got all of us laughing.
###192 I was around all these guys going to clubs in New York--
###195 being exposed to so much shit that these kids in my fifth
###198 grade class had no clue.
###200 I couldn't have conversations with them just because they
###203 weren't on my level.
###204 PATRICK O'DELL: Who's your skate crew?
###206 JAVIER NUNEZ: We were considered the young dudes,
###207 because everyone was older, so it was me, Maurice Key, Joey
###212 Alvarez, all the usual suspects from late '90s, mid
###216 '90s that were skating at the time.
###219 PATRICK O'DELL: Is that around the time you were in "Kids"?
###221 JAVIER NUNEZ: Yeah, pretty much all this shit happened in
###223 the span of two years, man.
###225 Once I got my foot in New York, I started meeting all
###227 these people.
###228 They took me under their wing.
###230 Harold was the one that got me in "Kids."
###233 HAROLD HUNTER: My name is Harold Hunter, and I skate for
###236 American Dream, which is totally cool.
###240 JAVIER NUNEZ: We just skating through the city, just pulsing
###241 up our aster, and then Harmony Korine comes walking by.
###244 Harold saw Harmony and was like, Harmony, you
###246 got to put Jav in.
###248 You got to write him in the movie.
###250 Harold was serious to Harmony.
###251 Harmony was like, yeah, you know what?
###253 I actually got a role for you in the movie.
###257 So I was like, cool.
###258 I didn't think nothing of it.
###259 PATRICK O'DELL: Oh, is it real alcohol, real weed?
###263 JAVIER NUNEZ: Today it was real weed, but I already was
###265 smoking before we were doing the film, so I was already
###268 exposed to all of that.
###270 And then, he just made us feel comfortable by letting us
###273 really smoke weed.
###275 No biggie.
###276 STEVIE WILLIAMS: I just thought Jav was
###278 just bigger than life.
###279 I'm like damn, he shot past me like crazy.
###284 He was the model.
###284 He was doing TV shows and movies and "Kids." When he got
###288 on Menace, I was like, damn!
###291 He's going to be one of the best teams in the world.
###293 He had to sponsor, so when he came up to San Francisco, and
###297 I was ripping around in the streets, he would
###298 be right with me.
###299 Because he already had to sponsor, so he could go and
###302 shoot photos with all of them, and then come back
###304 to hang with me.
###305 I just really thought Jav was the truth as a young kid.
###310 
###314 JAVIER NUNEZ: The switch flip over the wall, couple Cali
###317 tricks, something on the banks.
###323 I didn't really have a full part in the "Trilogy." Like I
###326 said, man, I should have been more of my skating as well.
###329 I have myself to blame.
###330 I don't blame no one else, because I was a little
###333 knucklehead back then.
###333 And to be honest, I didn't listen to Reem half the time.
###338 I didn't really skate much--
###339 like I said, me being around a whole
###342 different world of people.
###344 All my friends didn't skate every day.
###346 [INAUDIBLE].
###348 
###351 Not like out here, where people skate every day and
###356 have a clique of friends that is willing to film.
###358 
###361 That's what made me move to Cali.
###363 To be honest, if it wasn't for Kareem, I wouldn't be involved
###366 that much in skating, because he's the one that took me out
###369 of New York, New Jersey to expose me to the whole skate
###372 world industry.
###373 I never forget that.
###375 PATRICK O'DELL: You were on when it was Fabian and all
###377 these people to when it was Spanky and all those people.
###379 JAVIER NUNEZ: Yeah, pretty much.
###381 When it came to our city, I was the older one.
###384 It wasn't Little Jav no more.
###386 It was Little P-Rod, Little Devine, Little Mikey.
###390 PATRICK O'DELL: And none of the people that were older
###393 than you were on anymore?
###395 JAVIER NUNEZ: No, except for Lee.
###395 It was just only me and Lee left.
###397 
###400 PATRICK O'DELL: You had a board on City Stars?
###402 Unfortunately not, I never had a board on City Stars.
###404 My first pro board was Shut.
###407 PATRICK O'DELL: Did he ever express to you, fuck, why
###409 aren't they turning me pro?
###410 
###416 STEVIE WILLIAMS: I can't even go there.
###418 I can't.
###419 Because it hurts.
###420 It hurts me to know that--
###423 it just hurt, yo.
###424 Yeah, of course, Javier would get solidate that Kareem
###427 turned Paul and them dudes pro and all of that.
###430 And I was there with him every fucking day.
###434 Me and Reem had a fall out because of Jav.
###438 And I respected Kareem so much that I didn't want to
###442 disrespect Kareem, but Javier was my blood.
###448 I knew him before he even met Kareem.
###451 By the time it was for him to shine and get that value from
###456 Menace, it was already City Stars and Kareem already had
###461 all of these dudes.
###462 So when Jav wanted that light, I don't think the light was
###467 shining on that team anymore.
###469 So it's hard.
###471 You got to do it when it's supposed to be done.
###474 PATRICK O'DELL: Were you bummed at all when P-Rod
###476 turned pro?
###477 JAVIER NUNEZ: Yeah, I wasn't bummed that P-Rod--
###479 he deserved it, obviously.
###481 But I was like, you know what?
###482 Yeah, I was kind of bummed out on Reem.
###484 I was like, it's kind of lame.
###487 I been with his team forever, and these dudes are getting
###489 boards before me.
###492 But I guess, he felt like these dudes are killing it and
###494 all this shit, which oh, whatever, man.
###496 
###501 STEVIE WILLIAMS: Jav's hard-headed.
###503 That's all I'm going say.
###503 That's my man.
###504 And I love him, but Jav's going to do
###507 what he want to do.
###508 And that's just Javier.
###510 Everybody's different.
###512 Jav had the chance to be where I'm at.
###517 And when he was given a decision, he
###521 didn't take it, yo.
###522 And he got the opportunity.
###523 He didn't take it.
###525 He still has the skills.
###527 And it's harder to get on companies when you're older,
###531 so you might want to take advantage of those things in
###533 your early 20s.
###535 JAVIER NUNEZ: My mind, I wasn't always 100% focused
###538 with skateboarding, which I wish I was.
###542 But I'm trying to get back into the swing of things and
###545 just skate a lot.
###546 I took a lot of things for granted when I was younger.
###549 And as I get older, you start realizing this shit, learn
###552 from your experiences.
###554 PATRICK O'DELL: And you have HBO show.
###556 JAVIER NUNEZ: Yeah, and now, the producer from "Entourage,"
###560 Rob Weiss, happened to come by the shop and was like, know
###564 what, dude?
###565 You're perfect for this character I have.
###567 You fit perfect, man.
###568 It's about this crazy skateboarder, bipolar dude
###570 from New York.
###572 But I don't let these dudes blow air up my ass.
###574 I'm like, all right, it is what it is.
###575 Before you know a couple months down the line it gets
###577 picked up for first season.
###580 WILFREDO GOMEZ: I'm going to make you real proud at the
###582 event today, watch.
###584 I'm feeling real good.
###586 RENE CALDERON: Just don't set no kids on fire.
###588 
###590 JAVIER NUNEZ: The season was over, but now, HBO picked up
###594 the season again to come out in the summer of 2011.
###599 So I go to New York in March to start filming.
###602 
###605 Is LA a lot different than New York?
###609 JAVIER NUNEZ: It is.
###609 It's more relaxing for me.
###613 I did it.
###613 We did it all, running around New York City when it was real
###619 grimy at the time.
###620 And it was real fun.
###622 A time for a change in my life, I did
###625 the New York thing.
###625 Now, I come to LA to get different things going on.
###632 PATRICK O'DELL: Cool.
###632 Thanks, Javier.
###633 JAVIER NUNEZ: No doubt thank you, Pat.
###635 STEVIE WILLIAMS: I got a crazy a story about Jav.
###637 
###642 We in my crib, right?
###643 And we was playing this knockout game, where you stand
###645 up against the wall.
###646 And then you hold your breath, and they pump on your chest.
###649 Jav pumped my chest.
###652 I black out.
###653 I have a dream that Ryan Hickey frontside
###655 flips the bank wall.
###657 Next thing I know I hear, boom!
###660 I wake up like what the fuck?
###662 I'm face first on the coffee table, and my mom's like, what
###666 the fuck is going on?
###667 And I look at Javier's face and Mancha's face is like oh
###670 shit, you almost died.
###673 We played a knockout game, and somebody's supposed to catch
###675 them if they fall.
###676 He just let me fall and fucking hit my face on the
###679 coffee table.
###680 And I looked at this nigger like, yo, I should fuck
###683 you up right now.
###684 I'm glad I didn't die.
###687 And me and Jav always bug out on that.
###688
