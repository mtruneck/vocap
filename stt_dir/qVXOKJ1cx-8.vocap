###5 - Hey, Lindsey. - Hey.
###7 - What are you up to today? - Nothing.
###10 Who are you talking to?
###11 No one.
###13 Well tell no one I said nothing.
###16 Okay.
###20 - Hey mom. - Hi.
###21 Mind if I watch some futbol?
###22 Well at least one of kids is speaking to me today.
###25 Of course sweetheart, go ahead.
###27 Thank you.
###30 Hey honey, what's up?
###31 Nobody. Nowhere. No nothing.
###36 Hey, Kevin. What are you up to?
###38 Nothin'. Just watching football.
###40 Football?
###41 I didn't know you were into football.
###43 Are you kidding?
###44 It's the greatest sport in the world.
###46 My man.
###47 I didn't even know the preseason had started.
###49 The super classic continues.
###51 It's a huge one today,
###52 as it's the Western conference semifinals game two, tied 2-all.
###55 What's this? Put it on football.
###57 What do you mean? This is football.
###59 Boy, my eyes may not be what they used to be,
###61 but I know the difference between soccer and football.
###64 Now, change the channel.
###65 This is real football, <i>futbol.</i>
###68 I don't know what fruit bowl is,
###69 but in America, we play football,
###71 the sport I played in college,
###73 with the pads and the helmets
###74 and the guys who knock each other around,
###76 the sport real men play.
###77 Goal!
###78 No fair. He used his hands.
###80 What kind of sport doesn't let a man use his has?
###82 No wonder nobody watches this stuff.
###85 It's the most popular sport in the world.
###87 That may be,
###88 but it's the least popular sport in my house.
###90 Now, change the channel.
###93 Change the channel.
###98 You know what?
###99 It's not fruit bowl, okay?
###100 It's <i>futbol.</i>
###103 Look it up in the dictionary.
###104 <i>Futbol,</i> man.

###119 goal, goal, goal, goal, goal!
###120 Yes!
###122 Hey, Kevin.
###124 This came for you.
###126 Cool.
###130 What's that?
###132 It's my autographed photo of Hope Solo.
###134 She is my favorite football player.
###138 There are no football players named Hope.
###140 Football players have names like mean Joe Green,
###143 Refrigerator Perry, L.T., T.O., A.P., Eli.
###147 What about Chris Hope on the Tennessee Titans?
###151 Can you frame that for me?
###152 Sure.
###154 Goal!
###155 Goal!
###157 Yes.
###168 Hey, baby.
###169 Hey.
###174 What are you doing?
###175 Uh, taking a quiz.
###178 Who is Tyra Cyrus?
###180 Oh, that's me.
###181 I created a fake profile
###183 and friended one of Lindsey's friends.
###185 That way, she would friend me.
###186 This way, I can see her profile.
###188 So since your daughter won't speak to you,
###190 you decided the best way to get to know her was to spy on her?
###193 Hey, that's the way we deal with North Korea.
###197 And, Nick, it's not spying. It's friending.
###200 Do what you want, but I think it's a bad idea.
###202 Did you know that Lindsey is into saving the dolphins?
###205 And if she had $5,000, she'd spend it on a Segway.
###209 Why wouldn't she spend it on saving the dolphins?
###212 Because nobody asked you.
###213 Who is that?
###214 Oh, that's Hope Solo.
###216 Did you know Kevin was into soccer?
###218 Yes. I'm his mother.
###220 He's been into soccer since he was five.
###222 What's the problem?
###223 The problem is, it's a girls' sport.
###225 Only men I know who play soccer
###227 are Pele and that dude who married Posh Spice.
###229 You're worried about my son's masculinity,
###233 but you know who Posh Spice is?
###235 That's 'cause I like girls.
###237 I'm not trying to Bend it like Beckham.
###238 Okay, well, Kevin loves soccer.
###241 You should give it a chance.
###242 You might like it too.
###243 No way. I like using my hands too much.
###246 He should give football a chance.
###247 Well, do what you want. I know my children.
###251 Lindsey just joined the group "Megan Fox must be stopped."
###256 Hmph.
###262 Hey, buddy.
###263 Got here as fast as I could.
###265 Thanks. You got it?
###267 Bam.
###268 Here it is, <i>Madden 11.</i>
###270 This baby is so new,
###271 John Madden doesn't even know about it.
###273 Put it over there by Barkley.
###274 I didn't think Kevin was into football.
###277 He's not. That's the problem.
###279 He's into soccer.
###280 And his favorite athlete's a girl.
###283 I don't want to have to buy him a sports bra.
###285 Mm, ouch.
###286 And the final score is girl power 1,
###289 father figure nothing.
###291 All that's gonna change
###292 after we play a few games of <i>Madden.</i>
###294 Unless he plays it
###296 and decides he wants to be a cheerleader.
###300 It happens.
###308 Uh.
###309 Who are you, strange boy sending my daughter gifts?
###313 I'm gonna have to friend you too.
###322 Suzanne, I have an emergency.
###323 What is it?
###325 You know that guy I've been dating, Jonathan?
###327 Yeah.
###328 What did he do?
###329 Nothing.
###330 That's the problem.
###331 Every time I call him, he doesn't answer.
###334 And when I ask why he didn't call me back,
###336 he acts like he never got the message.
###337 So last night, I tried one last time
###340 to get his attention
###341 by sending him naked pictures of me.
###344 No, you didn't.
###347 Yes, I did.
###350 And he didn't respond.
###353 So tomorrow I'm gonna break up with him.
###355 Okay, what's the problem?
###356 You've broken up with tons of guys.
###358 The problem is, I want to make sure
###360 those pictures are deleted off his phone first,
###362 because the last thing you want to do
###364 is break up with a guy who has naked pictures of you.
###366 I mean, you've seen what happened to John Edwards.
###370 Okay, what do you need me to do?
###372 Okay.
###373 Tomorrow night, I'm going out to dinner with him,
###375 and at 9:00, I need you to call me.
###378 And when I answer, I'm gonna act like my phone went dead
###381 and ask to borrow his phone.
###383 And then I'm gonna go into his phone
###385 and delete the pictures I sent him.
###387 Why don't you just ask him to delete them?
###390 Like a man would voluntarily delete naked pictures of me.
###394 I don't think so.
###396 That's funny, though.
###398 Right.
###406 Click
###410 click
###414 click
###416 What are you doing with my hat?
###418 I'm trying to take a better picture for my profile.
###421 Well, if you wanted a better picture,
###423 you might as well wear a paper bag over your head.
###426 - Give me my hat. - No.
###428 - Give me my hat! - No!
###429 What's wrong with you?
###430 Hey, hey, hey, you two.
###431 What is going on?
###433 Nothing.
###435 Whoa.
###436 What's wrong with Lindsey?
###438 I don't know,
###439 but I am about to find out.
###443 Hey, Kevin,
###444 you want to test out a early version
###446 of the new <i>Madden</i> game?
###447 <i>Madden?</i> What's that?
###449 It's a football game,
###450 NFL football.
###452 Sure, I guess.
###453 All right, cool.
###457 See, it's working.
###459 What's the latest on Lindsey?
###460 She just updated her profile pic,
###464 and Jenny likes it.
###466 It's working.
###468 "Me too."
###470 Smiley face,
###472 send.
###482 All right, Kevin,
###483 I'll be the Seahawks.
###484 You should be the Vikings.
###485 They have Adrian Peterson, the fastest-rated player.
###488 Who's got the best kicker?
###490 Kevin, no one picks a team based on the kicker.
###496 The Lions' kicker looks good. I'll be them.
###498 No, no.
###500 You cannot be the Lions.
###502 Kevin, the Lions are the only team
###503 in the history of the NFL to go 0 and 16.
###505 I don't even know why they wear uniforms.
###507 They should just play in jean shorts.
###509 I don't care. I want to be the Lions.
###512 Fine, you can be the Lions.
###513 But don't come crying to me
###515 when you don't reach the end zone.
###516 What's an end zone?
###519 Okay, this is gonna be a long game.
###522 To return this kick.
###528 McGill still going.
###530 Yes.
###531 First down.
###533 Not bad, Kev.
###534 You made it down to the 40-yard line.
###536 I think you might be better than the actual Detroit Lions.
###541 Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
###542 You can't line up for a field goal.
###544 Why not?
###545 Because it's first down,
###546 and you're on the 40-yard line.
###547 You want to score a touchdown.
###549 I like field goals.
###551 And it's good.
###553 Yes! Field goal.
###556 58 yards straight down the middle.
###558 This kid can kick.
###562 Pick up... Pick up the thing.
###563 Let's go.
###564 I'll whup you.
###565 Let's go.
###568 He's down to the 10,
###569 the 5, and fumble!
###572 Oh! And the Lions take over at the Seahawks' 1-yard line.
###575 Ho, baby.
###577 And in a surprise move,
###579 the kicking team trots back out onto the field.
###582 Wait. What are you doing?
###583 You're on the 1-yard line.
###585 You have one yard to go for a touchdown.
###586 I like field goals.
###589 Yes! Field goal!
###591 And our score: Lions 6, Seahawks 0.
###595 Pick it up. Come on.
###596 I'm hungry.
###597 Come on. Pick it up. Let's go.
###599 Play.
###600 Field goal.
###602 Field goal.
###604 Field goal.
###605 Field goal!
###608 Field goal.
###610 Field goal.
###612 Field goal!
###614 Yes!
###616 I win.
###617 Turn out the lights, folks.
###618 This party is over.
###621 I can't believe you won on all field goals.
###624 Hey, at least you were right about one thing:
###625 He never did make it to the end zone.
###627 Touchdowns are stupid.
###630 Why would you let everybody hit you
###631 when you can just kick it right over their heads?
###633 He does have a point.
###635 Plus, lots of these kickers were former soccer players,
###639 and everybody knows
###640 soccer players are better than football players.
###642 Excuse me?
###643 I know a lot of soccer players
###645 who could easily play football.
###646 I don't know any football players
###647 who could play soccer.
###649 And you are excused.
###651 I was a football player,
###652 and I could beat you in soccer any day of the week.
###655 How about tomorrow? We can have a shoot-out.
###657 Fine.
###658 Fine.
###663 What's a shoot-out?
###666 What's a shoot-out, man?
###674 Hi Lindsey
###676 "If you're still thinking about it,
###678 I say go for it."
###680 Go for what?
###684 Hey, Lindsey.
###686 Hey.
###687 Been thinking about anything?
###688 Not really.
###690 Going for something?
###692 Huh?
###693 No.
###698 Hey, Gigi.
###700 You're not gonna believe this.
###702 What now?
###703 That man deleted naked pictures of me.
###707 Voluntarily?
###708 Yes!
###709 Last night worked perfectly when you called me.
###711 But when I borrowed Jonathan's phone
###713 and went outside to delete the pictures I sent him,
###715 they weren't even there.
###716 That's great.
###718 No, it's not.
###719 I don't send those pictures to just anybody.
###721 How dare he delete them?
###723 Wait.
###724 I thought the whole point of this scheme
###727 was to get your pictures off of his phone.
###729 Yes, it's okay if I delete them,
###731 but he shouldn't.
###732 He should be sending them all over the Internet.
###735 I should be on the front page of Media Takeout.
###738 I see.
###740 Gigi, what's up with the gear?
###742 Oh, I just came from boxing class.
###744 I'm trying to work off my aggression
###746 before I see him again tonight,
###747 because this time,
###749 I'm gonna make him beg me to send him pictures,
###752 and then I'm gonna dump him.
###757 I see.
###758 Well, that'll teach him
###760 to delete inappropriate pictures of you
###762 that you wanted to delete anyway.
###764 I knew you'd understand.
###768 Did you drive like that?
###769 Can you help me?
###771 - Gigi. - What?
###772 There's no peripheral vision.
###774 You can't even see.
###775 Well, I didn't have to see all that much.
###777 It was just a straight line, then I had to turn,
###778 and then another straight line.
###780 Then I did a u-turn.
###783 Agh!
###784 Bring it in.
###786 What makes the grass grow?
###787 Chalk makes the grass grow.
###789 Dah.
###790 Dah.
###791 Dah.
###793 Dah.
###794 Hut, hut, hut.
###802 Hah!
###804 Huh! Hah!
###805 What are you doing?
###806 Defensive football drills.
###809 Soccer players wouldn't know anything about it.
###812 What are you doing here?
###813 Somebody had to bring the snacks.
###815 Plus, I need to be here to make sure everything is fair
###817 and that nobody has anything to complain about,
###819 no matter what happens.
###821 Orange slice?
###828 You ready?
###829 I was born ready.
###831 Goal!
###832 Hey, hey, hey, hey.
###834 I wasn't ready.
###836 Now I'm ready.
###837 Oh!
###838 Goal!
###840 You know what?
###841 You'd better enjoy that one,
###842 'cause that's gonna be the last one you get.
###846 Oh!
###848 Oh!
###849 Oh. Ahh!
###853 Look, Gigi.
###855 Lindsey has 69 friends on here.
###857 Wow. Bang!
###858 Look, she's taken a quiz:
###860 "Who is your biracial boyfriend?"
###864 And she's joined another group.
###866 "Did you know Megan Fox has club thumbs?"
###870 What is up with her and Megan Fox?
###873 Oh, look, she's been poked 67 times.
###875 And Jeremy commented on her post,
###879 "am thinking about going all the way this week."
###882 What do you think that means?
###886 I think it means what it's always meant.
###888 Sex? No way.
###892 Mm-mm, not my Lindsey.
###893 That could mean any number of things.
###896 What is going on out there?
###898 Soccer shoot-out.
###899 Oh, soccer players.
###901 So athletic.
###903 What do you mean, it could mean any number of things?
###906 I don't know.
###907 Well, you need to have a talk with your daughter.
###910 Bang!
###911 I don't believe this.
###913 And while you're on the subject,
###914 make sure you tell her never to send a guy
###916 naked cell phone pictures.
###927 How'd the game go?
###928 It was great.
###929 I beat him 10 to 1.
###930 He did better than I thought, though.
###932 Well, why don't you go upstairs and get cleaned up?
###934 I didn't even break a sweat.
###936 Go.
###938 Fine.
###942 Nick, I need to talk to you about Lindsey.
###945 Can we do it sitting down?
###953 Okay, so Lindsey is thinking about having sex.
###958 I saw it on her web page.
###959 See? I told you spying on her would lead to trouble.
###963 Spying on who?
###966 Lindsey, would you have a seat, please?
###968 Um, okay.
###970 Maybe I should leave you two alone.
###972 No, Nick, you stay.
###973 I need your support on this.
###975 Fine.
###977 What's this about?
###979 Your mother--
###980 are you thinking about having sex?
###981 What? Why would you ask me something like that?
###984 I saw it on your web page
###985 that you're thinking about going all the way.
###987 You saw my web page? How?
###989 I created a fake profile so I could see it.
###991 Lindsey, why didn't you tell me
###993 that you were thinking about having sex?
###996 I thought I could trust you
###997 to come to me with things like this.
###1000 Wait a minute.
###1001 You created a fake profile to spy on me,
###1003 and you're talking about trust?
###1005 I was just trying to find out more about you,
###1007 because it seems like you never want to talk to me anymore.
###1010 Well, that's not the way you go about it, mom,
###1012 and I'm not thinking about having sex.
###1014 Then why does it say on your profile
###1016 that you're thinking about going all the way?
###1018 I was talking about my hair.
###1020 I hated my last haircut,
###1022 and I was thinking about cutting it really short.
###1025 Really?
###1026 Really.
###1027 How could you spy on me like that?
###1032 Sweetheart,
###1033 I'm sorry for spying on you.
###1035 It was wrong and stupid.
###1038 Will you forgive me?
###1040 Yes.
###1042 Which one of my friends are you?
###1044 Tyra Cyrus.
###1046 Tyra Cyrus?
###1048 Really?
###1055 That was nice.
###1056 No thanks to you.
###1058 You barely said anything.
###1059 Thanks for backing me up.
###1070 I never knew soccer could be so hard, Charles.
###1073 All I wanted to do
###1075 was prove to the little guy I still had it,
###1076 like when you played with Scottie Pippen,
###1078 although we did make a little connection.
###1081 I spent more time with him in the last two days
###1084 than I did the whole last month.
###1090 How are you feeling?
###1091 Like I just played a double-overtime game
###1093 in the Super Bowl and lost.
###1097 Oh, my big, strong man.
###1100 Ow. Ooh.
###1101 I'm sure you probably let him win.
###1104 Yeah, kind of did.
###1107 Thanks, baby.
###1110 Kevin loves soccer. That's not gonna change.
###1112 You know what else is never gonna change?
###1116 How much I love you.
###1119 Come on, let's go inside,
###1121 and I'll rub your tired old legs.
###1123 Oh, let's go.
###1132 Any chance we could stay out here?
###1136 Oh. Ow.
###1137 Ooh.
###1138 Oh, my goodness.
###1139 I know.
###1140 Okay. Okay.
###1141 Whoo, help me.
###1149 Morning.
###1150 Morning.
###1152 Oh, did you break up with Jonathan yet?
###1155 Actually, no.
###1157 Get this: Turns out I always had his number wrong,
###1160 which explains why he never returned my calls
###1163 and why my pictures weren't on his phone.
###1165 He never got them.
###1166 So who's been getting your pictures?
###1169 I don't know.
###1169 I texted the person this morning,
###1171 but I haven't heard back yet.
###1174 Oh, the mystery person.
###1178 "Hi, my name is Carl."
###1181 Oh, no, it's a guy.
###1183 "Thanks for the pics.
###1185 "Let's get together soon.
###1187 Here's a picture of me."
###1189 Eww!
###1192 Doesn't anybody send pictures of their faces anymore?
###1195 You didn't.
###1197 Oh, damn, now I got to get a new phone.
###1204 All right, with seconds left on the clock,
###1207 double-k-p sets up.
###1208 He shoots.
###1209 Goal! And the crowd goes wild!
###1213 Hey, man. Hey.
###1217 I got something for you.
###1220 Who's this?
###1222 Pete Gogolak,
###1223 placekicker for the Giants
###1224 and was also responsible
###1225 for bringing soccer-style kicking to the NFL.
###1228 Whoa. Thanks, dad. I love it.
###1230 Turns out he was also the Giants'
###1232 all-time leading scorer.
###1233 A former soccer player.
###1234 Who'd have guessed it, huh?
###1236 Yeah.
###1237 I guess I underestimated you.
###1239 Hey, I'm ten. It happens.
###1242 So she's your favorite soccer player, huh?
###1244 Yup, but that's not why I wanted the picture.
###1247 Huh?
###1249 No, it's 'cause she's hot.
