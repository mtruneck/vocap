making science fun.


14
0:0:20,46 --> 0:0:23,45
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


15
0:0:23,45 --> 0:0:26,46
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


16
0:0:26,46 --> 0:0:27,5

0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:30,11
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


18
0:0:30,11 --> 0:0:32,369

think about science.

motto, make it big, do it

got the dog inside.


32

If you don't have speakers of
your own, sometimes you can


33
0:0:56,11 --> 0:0:57,16

especially if you're


34
0:0:57,16 --> 0:0:58,56
watching the dog.


35
0:0:58,56 --> 0:1:0,7

be responsible.

0:1:9,73 --> 0:1:12,12
You're going to do a classic
experiment using corn starch

42

We're going to put a little
twist on that, which makes it

broke these, this one will be

0:1:28,56 --> 0:1:29,27
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


52
0:1:29,27 --> 0:1:31,59
But these here are going
to be perfect for


53
0:1:31,59 --> 0:1:32,84
exactly what we need.

Big mixing bowl, corn
starch, you're going


56
0:1:37,54 --> 0:1:38,55
to need paper towels.


57
0:1:38,55 --> 0:1:39,8
And you're going to need
to have some--


58
0:1:39,8 --> 0:1:42,39



59
0:1:42,39 --> 0:1:44,71
water, because it's
going to be messy.


60
0:1:44,71 --> 0:1:45,69
Start with the corn starch.


61
0:1:45,69 --> 0:1:48,39
All right, what we're actually
making here is considered a


62
0:1:48,39 --> 0:1:50,31
non-Newtonian fluid.


63
0:1:50,31 --> 0:1:52,79
And more about that when we
start looking at the thickness


64
0:1:52,79 --> 0:1:53,3
of the mixture.


65
0:1:53,3 --> 0:1:54,975
But again, I'm not going to
dump the entire thing.


66
0:1:54,975 --> 0:1:57,2
I'm gonna leave just a little
bit there, because I'm going


67
0:1:57,2 --> 0:1:59,96
to want to be able to, if it's
too runny, add just a little


68
0:1:59,96 --> 0:2:1,34
bit more without having
to bust open


69
0:2:1,34 --> 0:2:2,52
another box of corn starch.


70
0:2:2,52 --> 0:2:4,92
If you haven't played with corn
starch just by itself, it


71
0:2:4,92 --> 0:2:9,9
has this crazy property just
without water, almost squeaks


72
0:2:9,9 --> 0:2:9,75
in your fingers.


73
0:2:9,75 --> 0:2:12,13
As soon as you add water, you're
just kind of working it


74
0:2:12,13 --> 0:2:15,82
in, and waiting for it
to be almost the


75
0:2:15,82 --> 0:2:16,97
consistency of honey.


76
0:2:16,97 --> 0:2:19,79
So just small batches of
water and work it in.


77
0:2:19,79 --> 0:2:22,375
The only way I found to
do this is to work


78
0:2:22,375 --> 0:2:25,47
it with your hands.


79
0:2:25,47 --> 0:2:28,25
When we talk about a
non-Newtonian fluid, it means


80
0:2:28,25 --> 0:2:31,5
that it doesn't obey the
rules or the laws that


81
0:2:31,5 --> 0:2:32,5
Isaac Newton set out.


82
0:2:32,5 --> 0:2:33,49
And he talked about viscosity.


83
0:2:33,49 --> 0:2:36,53
Now, viscosity is the thickness
of a material.


84
0:2:36,53 --> 0:2:39,78
So, for example, honey or
ketchup has a high viscosity,


85
0:2:39,78 --> 0:2:42,31
water has a very
low viscosity.


86
0:2:42,31 --> 0:2:45,21
And it said that the only way
that you can change viscosity


87
0:2:45,21 --> 0:2:46,41
is with the temperature.


88
0:2:46,41 --> 0:2:48,6
However, you're going to see
here in just a minute, and as


89
0:2:48,6 --> 0:2:50,99
you're playing with it you can
see, that this almost becomes


90
0:2:50,99 --> 0:2:53,575
like a solid when you
put force on it.


91
0:2:53,575 --> 0:2:56,45
And it's a liquid when
you allow it to flow.


92
0:2:56,45 --> 0:2:59,32
That's why they call it a
non-Newtonian solution.


93
0:2:59,32 --> 0:3:2,34
Let's see if this is
just about right.


94
0:3:2,34 --> 0:3:4,12
I think it's perfect.


95
0:3:4,12 --> 0:3:7,6
When it has this consistency
right here, you know that


96
0:3:7,6 --> 0:3:8,63
you've got a perfect batch.


97
0:3:8,63 --> 0:3:11,75
So make sure that the batch is
good before you move on.


98
0:3:11,75 --> 0:3:15,38
And now it's time for
the slap test.


99
0:3:15,38 --> 0:3:17,63
So you're going to take the
mixture and pour the mixture


100
0:3:17,63 --> 0:3:20,1
out onto a tray.


101
0:3:20,1 --> 0:3:20,8
This is perfect.


102
0:3:20,8 --> 0:3:23,5
It flows like a liquid.


103
0:3:23,5 --> 0:3:25,99
And the only way that there's
a change there, is with the


104
0:3:25,99 --> 0:3:28,3
pressure or the stress
that you put on this.


105
0:3:28,3 --> 0:3:30,52
So normally, if you would take
a liquid like this, this


106
0:3:30,52 --> 0:3:33,445
liquid here, and you slap it,
it would go everywhere.


107
0:3:33,445 --> 0:3:34,895
I think it's going
to be a solid.


108
0:3:34,895 --> 0:3:36,145
Watch this.


109
0:3:36,145 --> 0:3:39,27



110
0:3:39,27 --> 0:3:40,34
That's awesome.


111
0:3:40,34 --> 0:3:42,93
See, what we've actually made
here is a suspension.


112
0:3:42,93 --> 0:3:45,542
You have a finely dispersed
particle, that's the corn


113
0:3:45,542 --> 0:3:48,38
starch, dispersed in the liquid
that's there, and it's


114
0:3:48,38 --> 0:3:49,35
kind of holding it in place.


115
0:3:49,35 --> 0:3:50,82
It doesn't last for
a long time.


116
0:3:50,82 --> 0:3:53,39
So you can't make a mixture of
corn starch and water and


117
0:3:53,39 --> 0:3:54,77
leave it for weeks and weeks.


118
0:3:54,77 --> 0:3:56,6
It'll actually settle
out and become


119
0:3:56,6 --> 0:3:57,68
almost hard like concrete.


120
0:3:57,68 --> 0:4:0,94
So you really only have a life
expectancy of maybe four or


121
0:4:0,94 --> 0:4:3,15
five hours as you're
playing with this.


122
0:4:3,15 --> 0:4:6,16
It's impossible to take your
hands out of it and to


123
0:4:6,16 --> 0:4:8,59
understand that you've actually
made something that


124
0:4:8,59 --> 0:4:11,44
defies Newton's laws
of viscosity.


125
0:4:11,44 --> 0:4:15,129
It's a liquid, and behaves like
a solid at the same time.


126
0:4:15,129 --> 0:4:17,49
All right, back to
the bowl you go.


127
0:4:17,49 --> 0:4:20,43



128
0:4:20,43 --> 0:4:21,94
Look at the shear factor
that's there.


129
0:4:21,94 --> 0:4:23,13
It literally--


130
0:4:23,13 --> 0:4:24,89
you can break off of a piece.


131
0:4:24,89 --> 0:4:26,53
And you want to know
the best thing?


132
0:4:26,53 --> 0:4:29,8
The place that you do this, a
friend's home, will look like


133
0:4:29,8 --> 0:4:33,9
corn starch for the
next five weeks.


134
0:4:33,9 --> 0:4:34,2
Here's a cool thing to try.


135
0:4:34,2 --> 0:4:36,2
Just take a small amount
and actually roll it.


136
0:4:36,2 --> 0:4:37,5
You can actually roll it.


137
0:4:37,5 --> 0:4:39,79
It feels like it crumbles,
or will roll into a ball.


138
0:4:39,79 --> 0:4:43,83
And the moment you stop,
it just simply flows.


139
0:4:43,83 --> 0:4:45,155
It really is amazing.


140
0:4:45,155 --> 0:4:47,84
All right, we're going to need
to have an amplifier.


141
0:4:47,84 --> 0:4:50,13
This a pretty good opportunity
for you to head to your local


142
0:4:50,13 --> 0:4:51,82
thrift store and just
find something.


143
0:4:51,82 --> 0:4:54,26
I would not damage any
really, really good


144
0:4:54,26 --> 0:4:55,2
equipment doing this.


145
0:4:55,2 --> 0:4:57,42
So we're just using
an amplifier.


146
0:4:57,42 --> 0:5:0,17
I've hooked up the speaker in
the very back of the amplifier


147
0:5:0,17 --> 0:5:3,32
to these little clip leads that
you see here because I


148
0:5:3,32 --> 0:5:5,85
have a surplus speaker.


149
0:5:5,85 --> 0:5:8,38
So we just found a speaker
cabinet at a thrift store that


150
0:5:8,38 --> 0:5:12,12
was damaged, and for $5.00,
found the speaker.


151
0:5:12,12 --> 0:5:13,4
By doing this enough,
you're actually


152
0:5:13,4 --> 0:5:14,26
going to ruin the speaker.


153
0:5:14,26 --> 0:5:15,11
Look at this.


154
0:5:15,11 --> 0:5:16,77
You can see that I've
ruined the cone.


155
0:5:16,77 --> 0:5:19,95
The cone has become detached
from this as we've vibrated as


156
0:5:19,95 --> 0:5:22,9
hard as we're gonna vibrate
it here in just a second.


157
0:5:22,9 --> 0:5:25,45
So don't use your
best speakers.

0:5:25,45 --> 0:5:28,2
Or, don't use your speakers.

Black lead to the black,
red to the red.

0:5:31,34 --> 0:5:32,91
And now we need tone.


161
0:5:32,91 --> 0:5:35,69
So I'm just going to make sure
that these stay separated and


162
0:5:35,69 --> 0:5:36,9
don't touch.


163
0:5:36,9 --> 0:5:38,965
And now we need a
tone generator.

It's as simple as a free
app on your phone.


165
0:5:42,22 --> 0:5:45,11
All right, I just downloaded
a tone frequency generator.


166
0:5:45,11 --> 0:5:47,6
So go to your app store
and search for a


167
0:5:47,6 --> 0:5:48,23
tone frequency generator.


168
0:5:48,23 --> 0:5:49,55
This was free.


169

these tones.

0:6:3,22 --> 0:6:5,42
sounds pretty good.


177
0:6:5,42 --> 0:6:7,22
We're going to send the sound
through the speaker, but I


178
0:6:7,22 --> 0:6:9,21
don't want to ruin the
speaker necessarily.


179
0:6:9,21 --> 0:6:12,11
So I want to be able to cover it
with a small amount of this


180
0:6:12,11 --> 0:6:13,83
Saran Wrap here.


181
0:6:13,83 --> 0:6:19,22
So this will keep the corn
starch away from the cone.


182
0:6:19,22 --> 0:6:20,89
And now we're going to take
some of our corn starch


183

monsters." Look at this.


205
0:7:10,35 --> 0:7:13,8
Look at the movement here.


206
0:7:13,8 --> 0:7:16,85
Literally, it takes on a mind of
it's own as it wiggles and


207
0:7:16,85 --> 0:7:20,76
moves its way up, behaving like
a solid and a liquid at


208
0:7:20,76 --> 0:7:24,97
the same time, spraying
everywhere.


209
0:7:24,97 --> 0:7:28,21
But even this silly little
speaker here that's not that


210
0:7:28,21 --> 0:7:31,996
good does a pretty good job.


211
0:7:31,996 --> 0:7:36,45
Wonder what it would look like
if we had a great speaker.


212
0:7:36,45 --> 0:7:39,48
While that little speaker was
good, the neighbor's big


213
0:7:39,48 --> 0:7:41,59
speaker, the speaker
that we bought,


214
0:7:41,59 --> 0:7:44,57
is going to be awesome.


215
0:7:44,57 --> 0:7:46,16
Now, we don't want to
ruin this speaker.


216
0:7:46,16 --> 0:7:47,92
And so here's what
I'm trying to do.


217
0:7:47,92 --> 0:7:49,816
I want to cover it up with
some plastic, you can see


218
0:7:49,816 --> 0:7:50,14
we've done that.


219
0:7:50,14 --> 0:7:51,81
A little bit duct tape
around here.


220
0:7:51,81 --> 0:7:55,83
And now, the corn starch goes
right in the middle.


221
0:7:55,83 --> 0:7:56,77
Who am I kidding?


222
0:7:56,77 --> 0:7:59,36
This will ruin the speaker,
because just the mere weight


223
0:7:59,36 --> 0:8:1,95
of this on the cone will start
to tear the cone away.


224
0:8:1,95 --> 0:8:6,73
So do not use a good speaker.


225
0:8:6,73 --> 0:8:10,53
And we got it from the thrift
store as a joke.


226
0:8:10,53 --> 0:8:12,42
So say you want to turn this
into a science fair project.


227
0:8:12,42 --> 0:8:13,8
It's very cool.


228
0:8:13,8 --> 0:8:14,28
You just have to have
a question.


229
0:8:14,28 --> 0:8:17,2
So the question might be, at
what frequency can you vibrate


230
0:8:17,2 --> 0:8:19,1
a non-Newtonian fluid
to give you the


231
0:8:19,1 --> 0:8:21,19
best corn starch monster?


232
0:8:21,19 --> 0:8:22,13
Pretty good.


233
0:8:22,13 --> 0:8:24,67
You're going to have to download
the app and try to


234
0:8:24,67 --> 0:8:26,55
experiment on your own.


235
0:8:26,55 --> 0:8:29,2
20 hertz is awesome.


236
0:8:29,2 --> 0:8:30,305
Just between you and me.


237
0:8:30,305 --> 0:8:32,64
But experiment.


238
0:8:32,64 --> 0:8:34,36
All right, we're at 20 hertz.


239
0:8:34,36 --> 0:8:35,8
Watch this.

0:8:40,929 --> 0:8:42,83
STEVE SPANGLER: You start to see
a little bit of distress


242
0:8:42,83 --> 0:8:43,839
right here.


243
0:8:43,839 --> 0:8:46,82
And then you start
to see it move.


244
0:8:46,82 --> 0:8:48,83
You notice that this big
speaker is good.


245
0:8:48,83 --> 0:8:52,1
But cranked up with 100 watt
amplifier, this is about the


246
0:8:52,1 --> 0:8:53,52
best I'm getting here.


247
0:8:53,52 --> 0:8:58,97
So sometimes bigger is not
necessarily better.


248
0:8:58,97 --> 0:9:1,42
It is cool, but it's not giving
us the corn starch


249
0:9:1,42 --> 0:9:3,195
monster that we really want.


250
0:9:3,195 --> 0:9:5,94
So while this doesn't produce
the best corn starch monster,


251
0:9:5,94 --> 0:9:8,84
you can vary the frequency and
actually see the pattern that


252
0:9:8,84 --> 0:9:10,495
different frequencies make.


253
0:9:10,495 --> 0:9:12,57
It's kind of an interesting
observation, especially since


254
0:9:12,57 --> 0:9:13,57
you have the tone generator.

STEVE SPANGLER: Well, if we want
good response, we have to


257
0:9:39,16 --> 0:9:39,99
move to the sub-woofer.


258
0:9:39,99 --> 0:9:42,7
This is perfect for that
low base response.


259
0:9:42,7 --> 0:9:47,307
I think it's going to give
us exactly what we want.

This is just the perfect
consistency.


264

but to still give you that

0:10:3,23 --> 0:10:7,394
nice non-Newtonian property.

[VIBRATING NOISE]


267
0:10:18,9 --> 0:10:18,96
STEVE SPANGLER: You've got to
play with the frequency,


268
0:10:18,96 --> 0:10:21,9
because you're gonna get just
the perfect frequency to give


269
0:10:21,9 --> 0:10:24,34
you the greatest corn

We need more.

0:10:35,2 --> 0:10:36,215
We need color.

0:10:36,215 --> 0:10:37,915
All right, a little bit
of food coloring.


276
0:10:37,915 --> 0:10:40,93
So here's some food
coloring here.


277
0:10:40,93 --> 0:10:43,65
Let's just see what this color
here, whether or not it'll


278
0:10:43,65 --> 0:10:46,51
shoot up and make
some changes.


279
0:10:46,51 --> 0:10:48,33
All we're looking for
are some changes


280
0:10:48,33 --> 0:10:48,83
in the little patterns.


281
0:10:48,83 --> 0:10:51,46

are gonna make

0:10:51,46 --> 0:10:54,15
this look pretty good.
