0:0:4,7 --> 0:0:8,67
Okay, I'm going to show you a lovely recipe now, with salmon, new potatoes. We're going to make a


2
0:0:8,67 --> 0:0:11,869
nice salad.


3
0:0:11,869 --> 0:0:14,7
Now to introduce flavor


4
0:0:14,7 --> 0:0:18,21
I'm going to give mister fish his best friend fennel. Fennel seeds, okay if you've never


5
0:0:18,21 --> 0:0:19,4
bought this before


6
0:0:19,4 --> 0:0:21,989
just have a look in the supermarkets it's all
there


7
0:0:21,989 --> 0:0:26,14
one little tablespoon of fennel seeds in
there works with all chicken, pork and


8
0:0:26,14 --> 0:0:26,779
fish


9
0:0:26,779 --> 0:0:27,779
brilliantly.


10
0:0:27,779 --> 0:0:32,46
A good pinch of salt and a good pinch of pepper just give it


11
0:0:32,46 --> 0:0:37,149
a really good bash up.


12
0:0:37,149 --> 0:0:41,6
Drizzle that salmon with some olive oil


13
0:0:41,6 --> 0:0:44,83
then sprinkle that with half of the fennel, salt and
pepper mixture.


14
0:0:44,83 --> 0:0:46,65
We'll do exactly the same on the other side.


15
0:0:46,65 --> 0:0:51,2
Now the other thing is, loads of people
hate salmon skin. I'm gonna show you how


16
0:0:51,2 --> 0:0:54,3
you can make people love it with a
passion. And it's exactly the same as


17
0:0:54,3 --> 0:0:56,999
roasting a bit of pork, it's about crackling
really


18
0:0:56,999 --> 0:0:59,8
crispy crackling. I've got some new potatoes


19
0:0:59,8 --> 0:1:1,96
that have been boiled.


20
0:1:1,96 --> 0:1:7,1
I'm just gonna drain these little fellows,


21
0:1:7,1 --> 0:1:9,39
as you do.


22
0:1:9,39 --> 0:1:13,8
That's why I like cooking outside. Just going to cut them into like halves


23
0:1:13,8 --> 0:1:14,89
quarters


24
0:1:14,89 --> 0:1:18,17
basically rough and ready is what we're looking for. They're already boiled but I'm looking for


25
0:1:18,17 --> 0:1:21,26
I want to kind of put another element in them with the fish


26
0:1:21,26 --> 0:1:22,54
so


27
0:1:22,54 --> 0:1:25,58
with these potatoes here,


28
0:1:25,58 --> 0:1:28,35
little sea salt,


29
0:1:28,35 --> 0:1:31,55
olive oil again,


30
0:1:31,55 --> 0:1:34,41
some lemon juice


31
0:1:34,41 --> 0:1:35,84
and then your salmon


32
0:1:35,84 --> 0:1:37,56
can go skin side up


33
0:1:37,56 --> 0:1:43,1
right in the middle.


34
0:1:43,1 --> 0:1:45,4
I'm going to do a nice fresh salad, three parts


35
0:1:45,4 --> 0:1:46,74
extra virgin olive oil


36
0:1:46,74 --> 0:1:48,9
to one part acid.


37
0:1:48,9 --> 0:1:49,19
We're then going to hit it


38
0:1:49,19 --> 0:1:51,28
with lemon, of course,


39
0:1:51,28 --> 0:1:53,79
salt and pepper


40
0:1:53,79 --> 0:1:56,439
and then herbs. Let's be really confident
about herbs


41
0:1:56,439 --> 0:2:1,78
We've got mint here and dill. Chop up those herbs like that


42
0:2:1,78 --> 0:2:3,95
and then straight into that dressing


43
0:2:3,95 --> 0:2:7,3
I'm going to use a few bits and pieces that you might not have used in supermarkets before.


44
0:2:7,3 --> 0:2:10,869
Red and green chicory here. So we cut in half first


45
0:2:10,869 --> 0:2:12,419
And then from this top half


46
0:2:12,419 --> 0:2:14,229
you can just click


47
0:2:14,229 --> 0:2:16,439
these lovely kind of crunchy


48
0:2:16,439 --> 0:2:17,839
cuppy like


49
0:2:17,839 --> 0:2:18,939
salad leaves.


50
0:2:18,939 --> 0:2:20,499
So the same with the red one


51
0:2:20,499 --> 0:2:21,81
trim up the base.


52
0:2:21,81 --> 0:2:25,449
Then we're going to finely sliced those


53
0:2:25,449 --> 0:2:29,619
again we'll move that over to here.


54
0:2:29,619 --> 0:2:30,959
Cucumber,


55
0:2:30,959 --> 0:2:32,979
throw that in.


56
0:2:32,979 --> 0:2:34,229
A few radishes.


57
0:2:34,229 --> 0:2:37,889
And if you want to kind of give the salad a bit of a hum just literally


58
0:2:37,889 --> 0:2:40,379
smoe spring onions or a little red onion


59
0:2:40,379 --> 0:2:41,979
is lovely.


60
0:2:41,979 --> 0:2:47,389
Another veg I am using is fennel. Either grate it, or finely slice it.


61
0:2:47,389 --> 0:2:48,48
A touch more salt


62
0:2:48,48 --> 0:2:52,54
I'll dress that at the very last minute, ok that's
what you want there. Let's come back to


63
0:2:52,54 --> 0:2:56,729
this. There you go.


64
0:2:56,729 --> 0:3:0,229
Well i know that we've achieved a
beautiful crispy skin


65
0:3:0,229 --> 0:3:2,829
and also I can try and pull that off


66
0:3:2,829 --> 0:3:6,859
Just use a knife.


67
0:3:6,859 --> 0:3:10,879
That is what i'm talking about; people
will fight about that.


68
0:3:10,879 --> 0:3:12,349
A little bit of salt,


69
0:3:12,349 --> 0:3:13,399
back in the oven.


70
0:3:13,399 --> 0:3:16,809
Crackling, this is basically what we're
talking about. Just let that sit for a minute


71
0:3:16,809 --> 0:3:18,119
and then here


72
0:3:18,119 --> 0:3:21,909
you can see if your salmon's cooked
just by going to the thickest part which is


73
0:3:21,909 --> 0:3:24,4
here


74
0:3:24,4 --> 0:3:26,689
and is it flaking.


75
0:3:26,689 --> 0:3:30,819
Have a look here.


76
0:3:30,819 --> 0:3:34,469
I think so, perfectly cooked.


77
0:3:34,469 --> 0:3:37,969
Right, let's go and get our skin


78
0:3:37,969 --> 0:3:41,859
Now as that cools down


79
0:3:41,859 --> 0:3:43,799
it will go like a big old


80
0:3:43,799 --> 0:3:47,549
I'm going to put that there. Look you can see it's gone hard straight away. That


81
0:3:47,549 --> 0:3:49,739
is what I'm talking about!!


82
0:3:49,739 --> 0:3:52,319
Right, let's serve this dish up and stop talking
rubbish.


83
0:3:52,319 --> 0:3:54,79
Let's get our potatoes,


84
0:3:54,79 --> 0:3:55,419
got beautiful


85
0:3:55,419 --> 0:3:59,4
sort of baked potatoes but a bit of color on
them


86
0:3:59,4 --> 0:4:1,439
and then with the salmon


87
0:4:1,439 --> 0:4:5,69
just break out into some big bits. Like that.


88
0:4:5,69 --> 0:4:8,659
And then, just put that in the middle.


89
0:4:8,659 --> 0:4:10,419
You can serve this hot,


90
0:4:10,419 --> 0:4:12,249
you can serve this warm


91
0:4:12,249 --> 0:4:16,569
and even cold, it doesn't matter and then any of
that juice in the bottom


92
0:4:16,569 --> 0:4:19,37
you can use as well.


93
0:4:19,37 --> 0:4:25,2
It's all juice, only oil, lemon and lovely fish juices.


94
0:4:25,2 --> 0:4:27,319
Just a few little bits


95
0:4:27,319 --> 0:4:30,229
of, of lemon zest


96
0:4:30,229 --> 0:4:33,13
some nice herbs


97
0:4:33,13 --> 0:4:36,21
and then I love getting some sour cream or yogurt


98
0:4:36,21 --> 0:4:39,199
a couple of little spoons here


99
0:4:39,199 --> 0:4:40,439
Don't forget out.


100
0:4:40,439 --> 0:4:43,68
Incredible, listen to this.


101
0:4:43,68 --> 0:4:45,39
You know what I'm saying?


102
0:4:45,39 --> 0:4:48,349
Right and just clank it up


103
0:4:48,349 --> 0:4:50,229
and just put it over


104
0:4:50,229 --> 0:4:54,289
also to go with it, at the very last
minute dress that salad.


105
0:4:54,289 --> 0:4:55,8
So there you go guys


106
0:4:55,8 --> 0:4:56,62
Beautiful,


107
0:4:56,62 --> 0:4:59,399
beautiful baked salmon, crispy skin,


108
0:4:59,399 --> 0:5:2,97
baked potatoes, lovely crunchy salad.


109
0:5:2,97 --> 0:7:2,97
Hope you enjoy it, lots of love.
