0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,42

0:0:2,42 --> 0:0:4,98
SPIKE JONZE: (SINGING)
A salaam aleikum.


3
0:0:4,98 --> 0:0:8,189
A salaam aleikum.


4
0:0:8,189 --> 0:0:9,4
A salaam aleikum.


5
0:0:9,4 --> 0:0:15,81
[FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


6
0:0:15,81 --> 0:0:17,67
Should we interview
Shane Smith more?


7
0:0:17,67 --> 0:0:19,7
SHANE SMITH: Here?


8
0:0:19,7 --> 0:0:20,115
SPIKE JONZE: Yeah, right here.


9
0:0:20,115 --> 0:0:20,52
SHANE SMITH: OK.


10
0:0:20,52 --> 0:0:21,7
SPIKE JONZE: You know, I always
think that a lot of


11
0:0:21,7 --> 0:0:24,41
what "Vice" has done has
happened because of your sheer


12
0:0:24,41 --> 0:0:25,14
will of it.


13
0:0:25,14 --> 0:0:28,92
You've willed it to be through
your force of life.


14
0:0:28,92 --> 0:0:29,21
And--


15
0:0:29,21 --> 0:0:30,535
SHANE SMITH: Yeah,
I think that too.


16
0:0:30,535 --> 0:0:34,395
[LAUGHTER]


17
0:0:34,395 --> 0:0:40,88
SPIKE JONZE: You know, it's part
having a vision, part PT


18
0:0:40,88 --> 0:0:46,71
Barnum hyping it, and sort
of willing everyone to


19
0:0:46,71 --> 0:0:48,56
go along with you.


20
0:0:48,56 --> 0:0:50,21
SHANE SMITH: Yeah, when you're
starting out, you have to


21
0:0:50,21 --> 0:0:55,96
definitely be louder noise
than the other guys.


22
0:0:55,96 --> 0:0:57,4
SPIKE JONZE: You freak me out.


23
0:0:57,4 --> 0:0:58,26
SHANE SMITH: No, I'm
the only one that


24
0:0:58,26 --> 0:0:59,62
doesn't freak you out.


25
0:0:59,62 --> 0:1:0,792
See, you've forgotten.


26
0:1:0,792 --> 0:1:1,66
SPIKE JONZE: Oh, that's right.


27
0:1:1,66 --> 0:1:4,34
You don't freak me
out anymore.


28
0:1:4,34 --> 0:1:5,594
SHANE SMITH: I used
to freak you out?


29
0:1:5,594 --> 0:1:5,95
SPIKE JONZE: No.


30
0:1:5,95 --> 0:1:7,6
SHANE SMITH: See, I could
interview you.


31
0:1:7,6 --> 0:1:8,4
So how did I freak you out?


32
0:1:8,4 --> 0:1:9,76
SPIKE JONZE: I would say you
never freaked me out, but I


33
0:1:9,76 --> 0:1:11,786
would say you've calmed down a
lot since I've known you in


34
0:1:11,786 --> 0:1:13,36
the last eight years.


35
0:1:13,36 --> 0:1:14,5
You're calmer.


36
0:1:14,5 --> 0:1:16,99
SHANE SMITH: I was too--


37
0:1:16,99 --> 0:1:24,32
SPIKE JONZE: You had, like, this
gusto, which both made


38
0:1:24,32 --> 0:1:27,56
everything happen, but
also sometimes--


39
0:1:27,56 --> 0:1:30,1
here's where you
freaked me out.


40
0:1:30,1 --> 0:1:32,2
It's because whenever you'd
tell me what was going on,


41
0:1:32,2 --> 0:1:33,39
you'd be like people
are freaking out


42
0:1:33,39 --> 0:1:34,41
over what we're doing.


43
0:1:34,41 --> 0:1:36,6
We just put the new issue, and
people are freaking out.


44
0:1:36,6 --> 0:1:38,71
We're starting a new magazine
in Croatia.


45
0:1:38,71 --> 0:1:40,1
People are freaking out.


46
0:1:40,1 --> 0:1:42,575
We just wrote this script and
people are freaking out.


47
0:1:42,575 --> 0:1:44,14
And like, everything
was on 10.


48
0:1:44,14 --> 0:1:46,7
People were freaking out
about everything.


49
0:1:46,7 --> 0:1:48,25
And this was like
eight years ago.


50
0:1:48,25 --> 0:1:49,17
So, you know, you were
a younger man.


51
0:1:49,17 --> 0:1:51,48
SHANE SMITH: Yeah, well know,
I probably had to sell it a


52
0:1:51,48 --> 0:1:53,72
lot more because we weren't
as established.


53
0:1:53,72 --> 0:1:56,1
So I had to be, like, always,
like, pumping it, pumping it.


54
0:1:56,1 --> 0:1:57,3
And for sure, you're right.


55
0:1:57,3 --> 0:2:0,72
So I was probably selling
Vice with my head nod.


56
0:2:0,72 --> 0:2:1,86
People are freaking out!


57
0:2:1,86 --> 0:2:4,19
Spike!


58
0:2:4,19 --> 0:2:5,98
SPIKE JONZE: How do you think
you've mellowed out in the


59
0:2:5,98 --> 0:2:9,139
last 8 or 10 years?


60
0:2:9,139 --> 0:2:12,2
SHANE SMITH: You know, the
truth of it is, I always


61
0:2:12,2 --> 0:2:15,82
thought I was going to die
because, when I was young, I


62
0:2:15,82 --> 0:2:17,59
was in kind of a quasi gang.


63
0:2:17,59 --> 0:2:19,29
There was 12 of us.


64
0:2:19,29 --> 0:2:24,22
And then by the time I was
18, nine had died.


65
0:2:24,22 --> 0:2:27,93
So I would just get wasted,
and get into fights, and


66
0:2:27,93 --> 0:2:31,17
screw, and smash things, and--


67
0:2:31,17 --> 0:2:32,99
I didn't care.


68
0:2:32,99 --> 0:2:35,2
And I would always be like,
we have to do it now, and


69
0:2:35,2 --> 0:2:36,29
fucking let's go!


70
0:2:36,29 --> 0:2:39,1
Because I didn't there would
be a lot of time.


71
0:2:39,1 --> 0:2:42,32
So I think that when
you realize--


72
0:2:42,32 --> 0:2:45,65
I realized my mortality
was a good thing.


73
0:2:45,65 --> 0:2:47,2
Because I'm like, first of all,
I'm going to be around


74
0:2:47,2 --> 0:2:48,58
for a few years, hopefully.


75
0:2:48,58 --> 0:2:50,14
And we can take our time.


76
0:2:50,14 --> 0:2:51,83
We can enjoy it.


77
0:2:51,83 --> 0:2:54,3
And I didn't have to
drink every day.


78
0:2:54,3 --> 0:2:56,582
I didn't have to eat five steaks
everyday, although you


79
0:2:56,582 --> 0:2:59,43
wouldn't know it.


80
0:2:59,43 --> 0:3:0,83
I don't have to coke
all night.


81
0:3:0,83 --> 0:3:2,96
I don't have to fuck 20 women.


82
0:3:2,96 --> 0:3:5,89
And when that sort
of switched, then


83
0:3:5,89 --> 0:3:9,63
you're like, OK, now.


84
0:3:9,63 --> 0:3:12,48
Now what do I really
want to do?


85
0:3:12,48 --> 0:3:14,98
So I want to work.


86
0:3:14,98 --> 0:3:17,75
I want to put my indelible mark
on the cultural fabric


87
0:3:17,75 --> 0:3:20,74
because I'm an egotist still.


88
0:3:20,74 --> 0:3:23,34
I don't want to just be a guy
know for business or making


89
0:3:23,34 --> 0:3:27,53
"Vice." I want to write
books, and make films,


90
0:3:27,53 --> 0:3:29,44
and make the biggest--


91
0:3:29,44 --> 0:3:31,67
I want to be like Tom Freston
and you, rolled into one.


92
0:3:31,67 --> 0:3:34,25



93
0:3:34,25 --> 0:3:35,18
I want to do a lot of stuff.


94
0:3:35,18 --> 0:3:38,126
But I want to do it my
way and be happy.


95
0:3:38,126 --> 0:3:41,89
And also enjoy traveling to
places like this, which is the


96
0:3:41,89 --> 0:3:44,93
most beautiful place on
Earth, and crying.


97
0:3:44,93 --> 0:3:45,87
SPIKE JONZE: And crying?


98
0:3:45,87 --> 0:3:46,34
SHANE SMITH: Yeah.


99
0:3:46,34 --> 0:3:48,126
SPIKE JONZE: Come
here, let's cry.


100
0:3:48,126 --> 0:3:50,82
Come cry with me.


101
0:3:50,82 --> 0:3:52,33
It's OK.


102
0:3:52,33 --> 0:3:53,34
SHANE SMITH: See, [INAUDIBLE]


103
0:3:53,34 --> 0:3:56,1
that's a good interview.


104
0:3:56,1 --> 0:3:57,7
You're getting up there.


105
0:3:57,7 --> 0:3:57,22
That's--


106
0:3:57,22 --> 0:3:59,68
SPIKE JONZE: We're getting
there, we're not they're yet.


107
0:3:59,68 --> 0:4:2,149
We're not there yet.


108
0:4:2,149 --> 0:4:4,65
MALE SPEAKER: No one has
shit their pants.


109
0:4:4,65 --> 0:4:5,315
SPIKE JONZE: Yeah,
then we're there.


110
0:4:5,315 --> 0:4:12,21



111
0:4:12,21 --> 0:4:13,635
Ah, yes.


112
0:4:13,635 --> 0:4:14,885
Woo.


113
0:4:14,885 --> 0:4:21,579



114
0:4:21,579 --> 0:4:26,31
So Shane, so this game goes, I
give you a subject, and you


115
0:4:26,31 --> 0:4:32,37
give me something profound, and
quick, and mindblowing.


116
0:4:32,37 --> 0:4:34,962
And if I don't like it,
I cut your neck off.


117
0:4:34,962 --> 0:4:35,378
SHANE SMITH: OK.


118
0:4:35,378 --> 0:4:36,21
SPIKE JONZE: OK.


119
0:4:36,21 --> 0:4:48,36
How about, tell me
about self-doubt.


120
0:4:48,36 --> 0:4:51,629



121
0:4:51,629 --> 0:4:54,14
SHANE SMITH: Oof.


122
0:4:54,14 --> 0:4:59,9
I think my hyperbole was a
blanket again self-doubt.


123
0:4:59,9 --> 0:5:2,53
I think everybody
has self-doubt.


124
0:5:2,53 --> 0:5:7,32
And you mask it in
different ways.


125
0:5:7,32 --> 0:5:10,5
Tattoos hide self-doubt.


126
0:5:10,5 --> 0:5:11,825
Muscles hides the self-doubt.


127
0:5:11,825 --> 0:5:13,26
Fashion hides self-doubt.


128
0:5:13,26 --> 0:5:18,89
We put on outfits and personas
to mask our self-doubt.


129
0:5:18,89 --> 0:5:25,82
And for me, I had to push
it to the back of my


130
0:5:25,82 --> 0:5:30,466
sub-consciousness because
failure couldn't be an option.


131
0:5:30,466 --> 0:5:32,926
Uh-oh, there it goes.


132
0:5:32,926 --> 0:5:34,46
SPIKE JONZE: This is the
effect he's had on


133
0:5:34,46 --> 0:5:35,32
[INAUDIBLE].


134
0:5:35,32 --> 0:5:37,1
SHANE SMITH: I'm so
scintillating.


135
0:5:37,1 --> 0:5:38,55
SPIKE JONZE: So drugs.


136
0:5:38,55 --> 0:5:39,54
SHANE SMITH: Drugs.


137
0:5:39,54 --> 0:5:43,92
Drugs, look, I think that the
whole world is drugged on one


138
0:5:43,92 --> 0:5:45,5
thing or another.


139
0:5:45,5 --> 0:5:46,495
SPIKE JONZE: What drugs were
you ever addicted to?


140
0:5:46,495 --> 0:5:49,14



141
0:5:49,14 --> 0:5:50,41
SHANE SMITH: So cigarettes.


142
0:5:50,41 --> 0:5:52,262
Cigarettes was the hardest
thing I ever had to quit.


143
0:5:52,262 --> 0:5:53,83
They're insidious.


144
0:5:53,83 --> 0:6:1,69
Alcohol, there's a quote from
Napoleon which is a conquest


145
0:6:1,69 --> 0:6:5,75
has made me, and conquest
must sustain me.


146
0:6:5,75 --> 0:6:7,89
And so I used to say, alcohol
has made, and alcohol must


147
0:6:7,89 --> 0:6:9,43
sustain me.


148
0:6:9,43 --> 0:6:13,35
Because everything I did, my
hilarity, my lunacy, all the


149
0:6:13,35 --> 0:6:15,5
stories, all the crazy things
I did was all just


150
0:6:15,5 --> 0:6:16,75
booze-fueled.


151
0:6:16,75 --> 0:6:18,34



152
0:6:18,34 --> 0:6:19,93
SPIKE JONZE: Did you go through
a period where you had


153
0:6:19,93 --> 0:6:21,97
to be the Shane Smith
character?


154
0:6:21,97 --> 0:6:23,88
SPIKE JONZE: Correct, yes.


155
0:6:23,88 --> 0:6:25,49
Describe that Shane
Smith character.


156
0:6:25,49 --> 0:6:29,62
SHANE SMITH: Sort of the poor
man's Hemingway, sort of bon


157
0:6:29,62 --> 0:6:33,95
vivant storyteller drunk.


158
0:6:33,95 --> 0:6:37,12
Let's have 14 bottles of wine at
dinner, roast suckling pig,


159
0:6:37,12 --> 0:6:40,84
and a story about chopping
off a dude's head in


160
0:6:40,84 --> 0:6:42,91
the desert or something.


161
0:6:42,91 --> 0:6:45,11
Like, adventurer.


162
0:6:45,11 --> 0:6:47,46
I was never really addicted
to anything except for


163
0:6:47,46 --> 0:6:49,15
cigarettes and booze.


164
0:6:49,15 --> 0:6:51,857
And I probably did too
much cocaine for a


165
0:6:51,857 --> 0:6:52,33
little period of time.


166
0:6:52,33 --> 0:6:53,826
SPIKE JONZE: Yeah,
you did, a lot.


167
0:6:53,826 --> 0:6:54,62
SHANE SMITH: How do you know?


168
0:6:54,62 --> 0:6:56,26
SPIKE JONZE: Because I
remember seeing you.


169
0:6:56,26 --> 0:7:0,285
SHANE SMITH: I used to
do coke off knives.


170
0:7:0,285 --> 0:7:0,97
SPIKE JONZE: Off [INAUDIBLE]?


171
0:7:0,97 --> 0:7:4,125
SHANE SMITH: Off knives,
yeah, any kind of knife


172
0:7:4,125 --> 0:7:4,928
SPIKE JONZE: This is--


173
0:7:4,928 --> 0:7:6,8
SHANE SMITH: Whoa,
don't-- fuck.


174
0:7:6,8 --> 0:7:10,55
No, no, no, no, no.


175
0:7:10,55 --> 0:7:11,89
That's not a fun game.


176
0:7:11,89 --> 0:7:13,14
[INAUDIBLE]


177
0:7:13,14 --> 0:7:16,1



178
0:7:16,1 --> 0:7:18,89
We're going to put this back
in the area where it's


179
0:7:18,89 --> 0:7:20,21
supposed to go.


180
0:7:20,21 --> 0:7:21,6
SPIKE JONZE: OK, good job
with the sound bites.


181
0:7:21,6 --> 0:7:22,34
SHANE SMITH: Oh, thanks.


182
0:7:22,34 --> 0:7:23,4
Again


183
0:7:23,4 --> 0:7:26,32
SPIKE JONZE: What do you think,
like, how she we end


184
0:7:26,32 --> 0:7:27,1
this thing?


185
0:7:27,1 --> 0:7:28,85
SHANE SMITH: We should go
swimming and end it as


186
0:7:28,85 --> 0:7:29,65
the sun goes down.


187
0:7:29,65 --> 0:7:30,21
SPIKE JONZE: OK, that
sounds good.


188
0:7:30,21 --> 0:7:31,534
Making love on the beach?


189
0:7:31,534 --> 0:7:32,342
SHANE SMITH: Yeah.


190
0:7:32,342 --> 0:7:33,15
SPIKE JONZE: OK, got it.


191
0:7:33,15 --> 0:7:35,322
Oh, wow let's go down there.


192
0:7:35,322 --> 0:7:38,6
(SINGING) A salaam aleikum.


193
0:7:38,6 --> 0:7:39,31
A salaam aleikum.


194
0:7:39,31 --> 0:7:52,48



195
0:7:52,48 --> 0:7:53,73
What does it say?


196
0:7:53,73 --> 0:9:53,73
