###18 In Darlington, in 2008, a team of enthusiasts is building
###21 the first brand-new British steam locomotive from scratch in nearly 50 years.
###28 It's a multi-million pound endeavour that started nearly 20 years ago.
###34 Though the project is unique, the enthusiasm is not.
###38 Steam engines still have a huge and passionate following all over Britain.
###44 When you're near a steam locomotive,
###47 there's an almost elemental force at work.
###50 You can feel every single aspect of that machine is working.
###56 It's passionate, it's theatrical, it's dirty, noisy, powerful.
###63 It's heavy metal in motion.
###68 It's a combination of noise, and atmosphere,
###71 vast, cranking engines and colour and coal and fire.
###74 I just think it's the most wonderful thing on earth.
###85 Most of us think of steam trains as museum pieces.
###88 They were a Victorian technology, dirty, incredibly inefficient and dangerous.
###95 But as late as 1968,
###97 scheduled steam services still ran on British railways.
###102 After World War II, most European countries switched to diesel and electric powered trains.
###108 Britain chose to stick with steam power.
###112 Thousands of new steam locomotives were built.
###115 A quixotic enterprise doomed to failure.
###121 The steam engine had been around for 150 years, it had done its job, the world had moved on.
###125 The day of the diesel and electric train had come, and steam had to die.
###131 Other countries left steam behind long ago.
###134 Why did Britain persist?
###137 And why do we still find it so hard to let go of steam?
###154 The origins of Britain's post-war obsession with steam
###157 lie in the decision to build over 2,500 brand-new locomotives between 1948 and 1960.
###167 This was in stark contrast to many European countries,
###171 which chose to leave Victorian designed steam power behind.
###175 If you look at the railways of Italy, France and Germany,
###181 which were not entirely destroyed,
###183 but certainly in Germany, 70% of the bridges were blown up.
###188 Quite a lot of the railways were completely destroyed.
###191 And, particularly in France, they said, "Right, we are going to,
###194 "as fast as we possibly can, build a new railway."
###198 And when they built their new railway they said, "Right,
###201 "we don't want steam any more, we are going to electrify."
###204 The destruction of allied Europe's railways meant they had to be rebuilt from scratch.
###211 Our railways hadn't been destroyed outright.
###213 It was possible to patch them up, and keep them running with steam.
###217 The finances for a complete overhaul were not yet available.
###222 There were investment shortages across the whole of the UK economy.
###228 And railways were not top of the agenda, quite rightly.
###231 There was a National Health Service to fund, there were houses to build,
###235 there was a huge housing shortage. There was a steel industry to revive.
###240 There were tremendous investment challenges.
###244 The railways may not have been Britain's top priority,
###247 but their central role in the war effort had been crucial to victory.
###254 The use of railways during the war was a critical element,
###257 because the railways were not only operating at volumes that were much higher than in peace time,
###264 but there was no time to maintain the railways.
###266 Indeed, it was quite dangerous times to try and maintain the railways.
###270 The non-stop journey from Holland to home
###273 was made possible by the military authorities and British Railways.
###276 Red tape was cut and the green light shown...
###279 The Second World War left the four big private companies completely bankrupt,
###285 as far as their infrastructure was concerned,
###288 pretty much smashed up as well.
###291 Really, that's why British Railways came into being
###294 because the war had rendered the railways almost inoperable
###298 as a private source of income, to a certain extent.
###303 Most of Europe had operated nationalised railways before World War II.
###308 Britain had run four big, private railway companies.
###312 The London and North Eastern Railway,
###314 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway,
###316 the Southern Railway and the Great Western Railway.
###321 We had the combined railways system
###323 with four major companies, heavily regulated,
###328 providing railway services.
###330 They were utilities, they weren't particularly profitable,
###335 and they were largely taken for granted.
###337 The four big railway companies had struggled even before the war.
###342 When the Labour government swept into power in 1945,
###346 they promised to invest in the railways.
###349 Nationalisation was on the agenda.
###352 And the railways, what have we got there?
###356 Operated for more than 100 years without a break.
###360 Feeding a war machine for six weary years
###362 without adequate renewals and repairs that left them as tired as the rest of us.
###368 A wonderful, but complicated heritage,
###371 that could do with a bit of sorting out.
###374 The railways were run down after the Second World War,
###378 and the private sector, quite frankly I think,
###381 was going to find it hard to carry on.
###383 So when the government, as part of its nationalisation programme,
###388 offered the railways the possibility of compensation,
###393 the owners snatched their hands off, actually.
###397 1st January 1948 ushered in a period of new hope.
###403 The four great railways companies were brought together into one single new organisation -
###409 British Railways.
###412 It's just a few minutes before midnight, and very soon,
###415 the signalman here will signal in
###417 the last Great Western Railway train to pass through Reading.
###426 On day one of British Railways everyone was thinking, "We've got a bright future,
###430 "we're going to modernise, we're going to be a shining example
###434 "of a modern passenger transport system."
###437 With the passing of the old year,
###440 the principal railways of Great Britain, London Transport,
###444 came under public ownership. So the first big stride
###448 was taken towards establishing in this country
###451 a publicly owned transport system under unified management.
###455 The vesting of the four mainline companies, and more than 50 others
###460 in the British Transport Commission, is indeed an historic occasion.
###466 You can imagine the scene at midnight on 31st December.
###470 In many people's eyes, become owned by the people,
###474 whistles were let off, no doubt caps were thrown into the air.
###478 A very theatrical moment, a moment I think of real enthusiasm amongst
###483 great swathes of the population that the railways had become
###487 British Railways, the people's railway.
###489 But officially, the Great Western Railway is dead.
###494 And to many, undoubtedly, the late lamented.
###497 The assets they inherited were massive. They inherited everything
###501 that was within the control of the former railway companies.
###505 Not only the infrastructure which they owned, the track, signalling,
###509 all the locomotives, a very large number, and we're talking about
###513 tens of thousands of wagons, were just not fit for purpose.
###518 What also came into the railway operations was shipping, hotels,
###523 and well over a million people.
###526 British Railways were starting a new chapter, and so were the British people.
###531 Travel restrictions were lifted, and people took the opportunity
###535 to journey around their country again, looking for light relief.
###540 After the war, people responded to the new freedom to travel.
###544 Firstly, through more and more people going away on holiday to a resort,
###549 the archetypal fortnight in Hastings or Brighton or wherever it was.
###554 But also through the excursion.
###556 Both of those were responses to people's desire to get around,
###560 and there's no doubt about it, people started to travel again, big time.
###566 The mounting pressure on the world's oldest rail system
###570 got engineers and managers thinking about the future.
###574 The question of steam's continuing place on our railways had to be addressed.
###578 The steam locomotive had been a very successful technology for Britain's railways.
###584 But even in the 1930s, there had been discussions about
###588 how great a future, how long a future steam traction had.
###595 After the Second World War, the debate started again.
###598 What sort of traction should be used?
###601 Leading British Railways' search for a new type of locomotive
###605 was their chief engineer, Robin Riddles,
###607 who had three options to look at.
###610 Traditional coal-powered steam, electric or diesel.
###614 Electric trains had been successfully run in parts
###617 of southern England since the turn of the century.
###620 They seemed a logical replacement for steam.
###624 Electric was superior, it is superior, it was superior.
###628 But it cost more. Robin Riddles was in fact in favour of electrification,
###633 which was ruled out because of investment shortages after the war.
###636 We were in the middle of the austerity period.
###642 Electrification required miles and miles of costly overhead lines.
###646 Diesel power was more straightforward.
###650 Yet the first diesel trains to run on main lines in 1948 proved very unreliable.
###656 However, the real argument against using diesel power at the time
###661 came down to energy supplies.
###663 Diesel traction, certainly, relied on oil.
###665 There were some people who argued that we didn't have any oil -
###669 of course, nobody knew about North Sea oil in those days -
###672 and that it would be very foolish to turn the railways over
###675 to an oil-based form of traction, diesel.
###679 It was felt that coal was an indigenous fuel from this country, oil wasn't, and therefore we should
###686 use coal, we should use it to continue with steam locomotives as long as possible, and eventually
###692 convert the mainline railways to electricity,
###696 again using electricity produced from burning coal.
###700 Steam was the proven technology.
###703 Everybody knew how a steam locomotive worked,
###706 how it could be used most effectively, and above all, steam traction was cheap.
###710 It was cheap to build, anyway,
###712 it didn't cost very much to construct a locomotive.
###716 Britain was not yet ready for the expensive switch to electric or diesel.
###720 Steam power was cheap and coal was plentiful.
###723 But the decision to stick with steam at this time
###726 may have been built on more than just practicalities.
###730 It may have been influenced by personal agendas.
###735 I'm not sure that it was the right decision.
###738 Robin Riddles was a frustrated steam locomotive designer,
###741 who couldn't wait to actually get in there and design his own locomotives.
###749 For many of the people working in BR,
###751 it was hard to imagine a railway without steam.
###755 Beginning more than a century ago,
###757 it had helped to make Britain strong.
###760 For many who had grown up with it, steam WAS the railways.
###765 The train was the first sign of modernisation, pre-dating the car, of course.
###769 A steam train went to every corner of the country.
###773 They were the first thing that knitted Britain together.
###776 Everything about the railway was modern. It was new.
###780 We really can't understand what it was like to live
###783 in a predominantly rural society, when these great iron horses
###786 were crashing through, saying to people,
###789 "This is the future, you've got to get used to it."
###792 The engines themselves became cultural phenomena -
###795 heroic machines designed with fearful symmetry.
###800 Some famous engines became household names. The Flying Scotsman
###804 and Mallard, the fastest steam locomotive of all time.
###813 British Railways' decision to stick with steam after World War II meant that new locomotives
###817 had to be built, in places like Darlington Sheds,
###821 one of the oldest railway workshops in the world.
###824 You're OK, we can come down.
###833 60 years after nationalisation,
###834 a new locomotive, called Tornado, is nearing completion.
###839 It's known as an A1 Class and it's cost £3 million to build.
###845 This is a 160 tonne,
###849 90mph steam locomotive,
###851 capable of developing something in the region of 2,600 horse power.
###857 There'd been 49 of them built, during a period of 1948 to '49.
###862 It was the sort of engine that hauled the fastest trains from King's Cross
###867 to Newcastle and Edinburgh.
###868 The major things that they achieved, compared with the pre-war engines,
###873 were improvement in maintenance requirement.
###876 Easier to turn around and service, would run on less good quality coal,
###881 and would run longer between major overhauls.
###888 It would've been expected that these would've been in frontline service for 35-40 years,
###893 as their predecessors had been.
###896 That's it.
###907 The A1 class is a Pacific.
###910 And Pacific means that it's got four small wheels at the front,
###914 which are just carrying weight,
###916 six large driving wheels, and finally two small wheels at the back.
###921 One of the key features which goes right the way back to the Flying Scotsman in 1922
###926 is the wide firebox which goes right to the edge of the running plate.
###931 And on this, there's 50 square feet of grate fire.
###935 That's somewhat bigger than the pre-war engines, which were 41.5 square feet.
###942 The locomotive is equipped with Walschaerts valve gear,
###946 which is driven through a series of rods and levers,
###950 through this device here, called the radius link.
###954 Now, this is the essentially clever part of the steam locomotive,
###958 which avoids the use of gears.
###961 And as you start moving quicker, you gradually wind this in,
###965 so that by the time the engine is cruising at 70mph,
###969 you're probably only actually admitting steam into the cylinders
###972 for about 15% of the total stroke of each piston.
###978 It also explains why when engines start off,
###980 they make a very loud chuffing noise...
###984 Cos you're admitting steam for nearly the whole stroke of the piston,
###989 and then letting out the exhaust, at not much less than boiler pressure.
###995 But as you wind the gear back, you're only letting steam in for a short distance,
###1001 so when they're cruising they're making more of a soft beat,
###1004 rather than the fierce beat at the start.
###1016 Tornado is a new engine, but the design predates British Railways.
###1021 Looking forwards as a single, unified organisation,
###1025 BR chose to develop a new class of steam locomotive for the future.
###1031 Locomotive trials were set up to cherry-pick the best ideas from the big four companies.
###1040 We're knocking four railways into one.
###1043 That's bound to cause a bit of a clatter!
###1046 We're taking the thing a stage further than it had already gone.
###1050 To save waste and overlapping, we've got to standardise.
###1054 And standardisation
###1056 on such a big scale as this can only be done as it comes.
###1060 Each railway in the big four group had their own way of doing things.
###1065 Now what we have to do is to examine them all and take the best from each.
###1070 Everything from carriage bogeys to signalling.
###1075 Within two years, designs had been produced for standard
###1078 locomotives for the whole of the British railway system.
###1082 And they were designed specifically to be as easy to maintain as was possible.
###1089 A simple example of that is that a lot of the mainline express locomotives designed
###1094 by the big four companies had four cylinders -
###1097 you had the two on the outside, and then you had two hidden inside.
###1102 And maintaining the inside cylinders was actually very time-consuming and quite difficult.
###1107 The decision was taken very early on that all of the steam locomotives
###1112 produced for the unified British Railways would all be two-cylinder locomotives.
###1117 It would be possible to get to the wheels,
###1119 it would be possible to get to the coupling rods and the motion.
###1123 You would see, if you had pictures of the standard locomotives,
###1127 they weren't necessarily pretty, but they were very accessible.
###1132 Over the next decade, 999 Standard Class engines were built,
###1138 as well as more than 1,500 non-standard engines.
###1141 This great variety of locomotives running on the lines gave rise to
###1145 a cultural phenomenon that celebrated this diversity.
###1151 Young boys all over the country appeared at railway stations
###1155 in droves to catch a glimpse of
###1157 the weird and wonderful engines running on Britain's railways.
###1161 The spark that ignited
###1163 the train-spotting revolution was Ian Allan's
###1167 ABC Guide to Southern Locomotives,
###1169 which was published in 1942, when he was 15.
###1174 What it is, it's a list of numbers, which doesn't sound very exciting,
###1178 it's not a great read, but the point is that you take it out onto the end of the platform,
###1183 and you wait to tick off the engines as they come past.
###1188 And it became very popular amongst teenage boys.
###1191 It was kind of the iPod of its generation.
###1196 Train spotting in 1942 was hip.
###1200 It's unthinkable now, but it was.
###1203 During the war, Ian Allan was working for the PR department at Waterloo Station,
###1208 answering letters from the public asking for information
###1212 about Southern Railways engines and carriages.
###1214 One of my chores
###1217 was to deal with letters from the public, asking for information
###1223 relating to locomotive names and numbers and principal dimensions.
###1229 It was then that I said, "Well, why go to all this trouble
###1232 "writing separate letters to people?
###1235 "We should do this book which would encompass the whole thing."
###1240 The book contained all of the information about Southern Railway trains that the enthusiast needed.
###1246 Engine classes, numbers and dimensions.
###1250 The first run sold out immediately.
###1252 He published guides to other regions and train spotting took off.
###1257 There was very little else on the market
###1261 for boys or girls to participate in.
###1265 Because...there wasn't anything on during the war.
###1270 Everything was on a war basis.
###1273 And here was something that they could go down to the local station,
###1278 and watch the trains.
###1281 Railways did have a romance attached to them,
###1285 they were in a sense a hangover from the great Victorian period.
###1288 There was a sort of a wonderful permanence about the permanent way.
###1292 It was efficient. It did on the whole run on time,
###1296 it brought everything and took everything away.
###1299 The platform, the greeting, the departing, the arriving,
###1303 everything about the station and the train was exciting, particularly to children.
###1308 So it's not surprising that it attracted the romantic attachment that train spotting represented.
###1316 Don't you like to do anything else but the railways?
###1319 Well, yeah, there's girls and horses and...
###1322 Yeah, there's other things, but steam engines are nice,
###1325 you feel you have to have a steam engine, every now and again.
###1329 All these chaps say the same, they've got to have a steam engine.
###1333 You might be able to go a fortnight, then you've got to find one.
###1336 That thing's got a voice, it's making a noise,
###1339 it's speaking, it's a terrific noise, it makes...
###1342 Well, it just makes lovely noises.
###1344 When it's raising steam, 90 tons of it,
###1347 it sings like a kettle, it's terrific, a lovely thing!
###1352 Train spotting was at the heart of British culture for decades.
###1356 Far from being the anorak activity that its reputation now has,
###1361 it was a social activity,
###1362 a way for youngsters to meet.
###1368 One group of young lads used to meet up in Southall in London
###1372 to share their passion for the railways.
###1375 I suppose it's interesting how we all got together, we met, which was
###1379 basically Southall, the railway bridge, as far as I'm concerned.
###1383 The footbridge was a meeting place for us, evenings, weekends.
###1388 It was a social gathering point.
###1391 Exactly. There was always somebody there.
###1394 I often hear this mimicked in today's society, "Oh, there wasn't a lot to do."
###1398 But in fairness, in the late '50s, early '60s,
###1401 there wasn't a great deal to do.
###1403 And we had to find our own fun.
###1407 Well, you'd arrive on the bike, park up your bike on the bridge.
###1413 Erm, possibly stock up with frozen Jubbly and...
###1417 Frozen Jubblies, yes! Ha ha!
###1419 I mean, you could see right the way down the line as far as Hanwell,
###1422 so you could see trains coming well over a mile away,
###1426 and there was this sort of crescendo as they approached.
###1429 And then the thrill of the thing going past, getting the number...
###1432 - Smoke and steam. - Seeing what sort of train it was,
###1435 it might have been a milk train, might have been a parcels or goods...
###1441 Many of the pre-war trains were still running on the main lines,
###1445 as well as the new standard classes.
###1447 Locomotive diversity was at its height.
###1450 There was more to see than there is now.
###1452 There were different kinds of locomotives.
###1455 Now, there are only three or four of the motive units that we might see.
###1459 Then you'd see lots and lots of different engines.
###1463 Pre-nationalisation, the coaches would have different liveries,
###1467 it was easier to get to see really quite odd things.
###1471 You would see little tank engines doing jobs,
###1474 or big steam engines coming through.
###1476 So there were lots more things to see.
###1480 The nation's youth celebrated the new steam age.
###1483 Britain's romantic view of steam appeared to be as strong as ever.
###1489 The romance that people attached to it very rarely applied to the actual workers.
###1494 Nothing illustrates the ambivalence of the British towards modernisation
###1498 so much as their attitude towards a steam train.
###1500 No, they wouldn't do it themselves.
###1502 But, yes, they wanted someone else to do it, because they rather liked the romance of it.
###1507 As a teenager, Peter Gransden worked for British Railways
###1510 stoking the fires on locomotives in the last years of steam.
###1515 The only light thing on the railways
###1517 was the wage packet.
###1518 Everything else was pretty hard.
###1521 Some jobs were easy, but the majority of actually running
###1524 the railway were very difficult jobs.
###1527 You know, not much money and long hours.
###1531 The fireman, he literally looks after the fire
###1535 and also looks after the water in the boiler for making steam,
###1539 and he also has to look out for the signals,
###1541 because the driver is on the opposite side of the train to where the signals are.
###1547 So he has quite a lot to do. Yeah, it was dirty.
###1551 I mean, you got bloody filthy.
###1555 And, like, you had no washing facilities on the sheds,
###1558 and you had a bucket, and you filled the bucket up
###1561 from the overflow from the injectors, you'd get a bar of soap,
###1564 and you'd have the best wash you could from that.
###1567 And if you was on some turns, and you were going out
###1570 with your girlfriend of an evening, you'd get as much dirt off
###1574 as you could and hope it didn't rain because if it rained
###1577 you'd have all dirty streaks down your face out of your hair!
###1580 Which didn't look very good, really.
###1588 As time wore on, it wasn't just the railwaymen
###1590 who had had enough of the dirty Victorian technology.
###1593 The general British public were starting to tire of it as well.
###1600 In the immediate years after the war, rail was the only option for long distance travel.
###1605 During the '50s, what happened was that the railways were slow,
###1610 they weren't desperately keen.
###1613 Most people took their holidays from Saturday to Saturday
###1617 over eight or nine weeks in the summer.
###1620 The railways actually couldn't handle the development
###1623 of holidays with pay, as it became known in the early 1950s.
###1629 And many people and many families' only experience of long-distance rail travel
###1633 was on summer Saturdays in dirty, clapped-out coaches
###1637 with trains running increasingly late.
###1639 And as soon as they had the opportunity to buy a family car,
###1642 they just never travelled on the train at all.
###1645 They may have done if they were commuting to work in London or another city.
###1648 But the thought of getting on the train to go on your holidays,
###1652 by the mid 1960s, fewer and fewer people did so.
###1657 Not only was BR losing its public, but also their freight services
###1661 were increasingly in decline, as more goods were transported by road.
###1666 British Railways ceased to be a profitable company.
###1671 Well, quite simply, what happened in 1948 to 1955
###1675 is that British Rail began to lose money.
###1677 It began to register operating deficits,
###1681 having not done so previously, and it was
###1686 being challenged by road transport, both on the freight side,
###1690 and on the passenger side, for the first time.
###1693 And I think, therefore,
###1695 this is the origin of what was called the British Rail problem.
###1699 And I think this informs attitudes to motive power.
###1703 How can we get operating costs down?
###1706 And one of the ways that one could do that was to replace steam with diesel.
###1711 After the war, it had not been seen as cost effective to leave
###1715 steam behind because coal was still cheap and plentiful.
###1719 Within a few years, coal prices were on the rise,
###1722 and oil prices were dropping.
###1724 The time had come to make the big switch to diesel power.
###1729 By the middle of the 1950s it was becoming apparent that steam was not
###1734 going to be easy to perpetuate. Several things were working
###1737 against it. The price of coal was going up fairly dramatically.
###1740 Of course, steam locomotives are messy things that tend to need
###1744 maintenance 24 hours a day, and it was becoming more and more difficult
###1748 to get people to work on them.
###1750 In 1955, the British Transport Commission,
###1753 which by that point had taken over all responsibility for
###1758 strategic planning on the railway,
###1760 announced a modernisation plan to spend really quite considerable
###1765 amounts of capital for modernisation of the railways.
###1767 A key element of the plan was the abolition of steam traction
###1771 because it was now felt that diesel traction had developed
###1775 to the point where it was a viable, workable technology.
###1778 And also that there should be some
###1780 large-scale electrification of Britain's main lines.
###1784 So by the mid-1950s it was widely recognised within the industry and
###1789 outside the industry that steam traction was coming
###1792 to the end of its useful life.
###1795 Steam overreached itself.
###1797 The world moved on, and steam paid little heed to change.
###1801 In the kingdom of the railways,
###1803 diesel and electric have usurped the throne.
###1807 The glory of steam is played out.
###1809 Finished. Gone.
###1814 Despite the fact that nearly 2,000 standard
###1817 and non-standard engines had been built by the mid '50s,
###1820 the writing was on the wall for steam power.
###1827 British Railways were promised a new lease of life.
###1830 A vast modernisation plan to be carried out
###1833 over 15 years at a cost of more than £1,500 million.
###1839 The days of the grand old steam locomotives were numbered.
###1846 These sleek new giants began to take their place.
###1850 The transition from steam to newer forms of traction
###1854 was not an altogether smooth one.
###1857 HORN BLOWS
###1859 The result was, on the one hand,
###1861 that the rate of withdrawal of steam traction increased.
###1864 So steam locomotives were taken out of service more and more rapidly.
###1869 But the new diesels often broke down.
###1871 They were often unreliable, or some of them were unreliable.
###1875 So quite often in the late 1950s and early 1960s, British Railways
###1880 was faced with the unenviable image
###1883 of brand-new diesel locomotives being hauled back,
###1887 rescued, as it were, from breakdowns
###1890 by the old-fashioned steam locomotive.
###1895 The passing of steam was happening.
###1897 Even the railway enthusiasts could see
###1899 that the age of steam could not carry on.
###1902 The age of steam had to finish
###1904 because it is an inefficient means of transportation.
###1909 Burning coal to turn water into steam
###1911 is very, very, very inefficient.
###1913 It's dirty, and it's manpower intensive,
###1916 and I don't think it could've survived into the 21st century.
###1921 Even if they'd had the will to do so.
###1923 Steam was dirty, noisy and impractical.
###1927 New diesels were clean, safe and quiet.
###1930 For many of the people working on the trains every day,
###1933 the end of steam could not come soon enough.
###1937 Bill, how do you like driving one of these new diesels?
###1940 Oh, I like them very much, I think they're a driver's dream, you know.
###1944 It's vastly different altogether to the old steam engine,
###1948 they're much cleaner.
###1949 Do you get as much satisfaction out of the job
###1952 - as you did driving the old steam locos? - I think so,
###1955 and as a matter of fact, now I'm used to it,
###1957 I get more satisfaction. Why I say that is because,
###1961 with the old steam engine with its faults and that,
###1965 we did have some difficulty in maintaining the schedule
###1968 when we got behind,
###1969 but owing to the enormous amount of reserve power that
###1972 we've got with these, we can pick up
###1975 quite a lot of time and maintain an on-time schedule.
###1981 The modernisation plan had promised an end to steam-powered locomotives,
###1987 but steam engines carried on being built for several years.
###1994 British Railways continued to make steam locomotives until 1960.
###1999 The modernisation plan of 1955 had said that steam locomotives
###2002 will eventually be eliminated, though it didn't give a timescale.
###2006 And the steam locomotives that were being built into 1960 had,
###2012 essentially, a useful life of between 25 and 30 years.
###2016 And it wasn't until March 1960 that the last steam locomotive
###2020 was built for Britain's mainline railways.
###2023 It was built at Swindon, and in the tradition
###2026 of the Great Western Railway and Swindon Works of naming engines after
###2031 the stars in the heavens, it was called, appropriately, Evening Star.
###2038 Evening Star was, in many ways, a normal steam engine,
###2042 built to haul heavy freight and passenger trains.
###2046 But the men who built and named her knew the significance she held.
###2049 The ceremony to launch Evening Star was a sombre and poignant affair.
###2056 And d'you know, the incredible thing about Evening Star
###2059 is, having been completed in 1960, it was out of service by 1965.
###2064 Five years' work, just gives you an idea of the, almost the...
###2068 if not undue haste, certainly the ill-planned haste
###2072 with which the transition to steam and diesel took place.
###2075 HORN BLOWS
###2080 There was this assumption that steam would keep going
###2082 until the early or the mid 1970s,
###2084 so it wasn't completely crackers
###2087 to build Evening Star, on that assumption.
###2090 But what happens is, you get this shift
###2092 at the end of the '50s where they say,
###2094 "Well, we've got to build diesels
###2097 "because they're going to be cheaper,"
###2099 and there's this momentum.
###2101 You can't just stop construction programmes just like that.
###2106 The unions object, this kind of thing.
###2111 Perfectly good steam trains started to be taken off the railway
###2115 and out of use for ever.
###2117 The locomotives and carriages were sent to scrap yards.
###2121 But BR recognised the importance to the nation's heritage in some
###2124 of these locomotive engines,
###2126 and decided to save a number of them for posterity.
###2131 British Railways produced a list of the 71 steam locomotives
###2134 it felt ought to be preserved.
###2136 That was a huge commitment, because they weren't thinking about
###2141 populating a whole network of heritage railways. This was...
###2145 Their perception was of static museums.
###2149 I think it's a pretty long list rather than a short one, when you
###2153 consider what they were committing future generations to holding on to.
###2159 The list of 71 contained many well known engines,
###2162 covering steam's long history.
###2165 But most were from the previous century,
###2167 ignoring the working locomotives known and loved by trains potters.
###2172 Some enthusiasts were bound to be disappointed.
###2177 Well, I think we got together on the footbridge,
###2179 and we though we'd better have a meeting about this.
###2183 So we had this meeting and, because I'd got a typewriter,
###2186 I said, "Well, I'll write a letter to The Railway Magazine."
###2191 The letter called for donations from fellow enthusiasts
###2195 to buy a 14XX steam engine from British Railways.
###2198 A couple of months went by,
###2200 and to be fair, we may have thought, "Ah, well,
###2203 "it's not gonna happen, but it's nice while it lasted."
###2206 And I was on holiday in the Lake District, on a camping holiday,
###2210 and my post was forwarded to me by my mother,
###2213 and I opened up this envelope in the middle of the Lake District,
###2217 to find a £10 cheque in it from somebody,
###2219 subscribing to my appeal for the money to buy this engine,
###2223 and I thought, "Goodness!
###2225 - "What are we gonna do now?!" - Yeah, what are we gonna do now, yeah!
###2232 Within a few months, they had received enough money
###2235 to buy the engine and begin restoring it.
###2240 Well, it's not looking so bad.
###2242 Although, er, how many hundred pounds did we have to pay for it now?
###2246 - 950. - No, six hundred and...
###2249 I think it was £690.
###2251 There was certainly change out of £1,000.
###2253 And a £50 delivery charge, I think.
###2258 Dear me! So...!
###2264 Then we thought, where are we gonna put it?
###2268 You know, who's got the biggest back garden?
###2272 We had a steam engine, a good steam engine, that worked.
###2275 And we thought, "Well, we wanna make it work."
###2279 None of us had ever driven a steam engine,
###2281 didn't know how to light it up.
###2282 Eventually, we found somebody
###2285 who could give us some advice.
###2298 Literally, we steamed this engine on a bit of track,
###2301 which had a road right next to it.
###2302 We were puffing this engine up and down.
###2306 I've always thought, right from the earliest days of the society, that,
###2310 erm, because we were 16,
###2313 we weren't experts at raising funds, buying railway engines,
###2318 doing any of this type of thing.
###2320 And I think that meant that we had no conception
###2322 of the fact that probably what we were trying to do wasn't possible.
###2327 Which is why we went on and did it.
###2339 The Southall boys were not alone in their crusade.
###2342 Others were racing against the clock to preserve steam's heritage.
###2349 The axing of trains and lines continued apace.
###2353 The modernisation plan hadn't worked.
###2355 The railways were losing more money than ever.
###2364 Well, from the mid '50s, things began to change.
###2367 There was no fuel rationing affecting private motoring,
###2371 road transport began to get a great impetus from new road building, culminating
###2377 in the first motorway, the M1, in 1959.
###2382 It was a period of economic prosperity.
###2385 It was important that the railways didn't fall behind.
###2388 But one could say that they were already in a difficult position.
###2394 Within the Ministry of Transport, there was a feeling that road
###2397 transport was important to invest in because rail transport was declining.
###2403 It was certainly losing market share.
###2407 The Beeching report of 1963 advocated the closure
###2411 of money-losing regional lines,
###2414 and speeded up the changeover to diesel powered trains.
###2417 Of course, some of you will say,
###2420 "Well, what about all this modernisation?
###2423 "Can't we have the branch lines as well?
###2426 "Can't you attract enough traffic to them to make them pay?"
###2431 But unfortunately, we can't.
###2432 We cannot make them pay,
###2435 because the traffic is not there, and so many people have motor cars.
###2440 The real question is whether you, as owners of the railways, want us
###2445 to go on running these services, at very high cost,
###2448 when the demand for them has very largely disappeared.
###2453 Steam was being withdrawn at a time
###2455 when the nature of the railway itself was changing.
###2460 The railway was now being seen by railway managers
###2463 and many politicians alike
###2465 as something which would become much more specialised.
###2469 The railway would do what it could do best -
###2473 fast, inter-city passenger trains, bulk freight trains...
###2477 Yes, there was gonna be money for modernisation, but it was going
###2480 to be modernisation money spent on a much smaller railway system,
###2484 a much more specialised railway system.
###2487 To reclaim the market being lost to private motoring,
###2492 BR introduced a new and elite service.
###2494 Naturally, the ultra-modern trains used diesel engines, not steam.
###2499 Luxury Pullmans provide one of the answers.
###2502 Here's the first, introduced on the Manchester to London run.
###2506 It's good but pricey.
###2508 It's already called the Expense Account train.
###2511 The coaches are air conditioned and draught proof.
###2516 The food is excellent, all cooked in a spotless kitchen.
###2522 And as it cruises along comfortably at an average speed of 90mph,
###2525 it cocks a snook at the traffic on the M1.
###2533 Beeching regarded the electrification of the railway
###2537 and the dieselification of the railway, if that's the word,
###2539 he regarded it as simply the emblem of modernisation.
###2542 The new Britain, the Britain of the '60s,
###2545 had nothing to do with this filthy, old technology.
###2549 He also had to grapple with the fact
###2551 that he was running steam engines on branch lines with no passengers.
###2555 And the fact that people appeared to love them hadn't
###2558 made them use them. So Beeching saw the end of steam as the advent of
###2562 rationalism, as well as of modernisation, in British Industry.
###2565 I mean, he wasn't a railwayman himself. He was just sensible.
###2569 And he realised this had to be the great battle,
###2571 and he fought it and he won it.
###2578 The closure of underused branch lines
###2581 upset and isolated rural communities.
###2584 The final steam services could draw huge crowds,
###2587 as people came to lament the passing of an era.
###2598 Living appropriately in a station 14 months derelict, Miss Laurence Aston,
###2602 35 years a railways worker, broods on the injustice of bureaucracy
###2606 and the wrongs of the Great Western Railway.
###2609 Were you here when the last train left?
###2610 - Yes, I was. - Tell me about that.
###2614 Well, it was a long train with a big engine, and crowded.
###2619 Of course they couldn't crowd it before.
###2621 But this was the last trip.
###2625 And to most of them, it was just a junket thing, a party,
###2629 an excuse to make a noise.
###2630 But to me it was like riding behind a hearse, it really was.
###2644 Throughout the country, throughout the '60s,
###2647 steam was clinically removed from
###2650 first railway sheds, but then from complete regions.
###2654 For instance, the Western region, which covered an enormous area,
###2659 was basically steam free by the end of 1965.
###2664 And another one of the last of the 300 steam locomotives
###2668 in service with British Railways comes to the end
###2672 of the line, to its final resting place in a sidings
###2676 which is becoming known as the graveyard of steam.
###2681 In one year alone, 500 locomotives, 4,000 coaches, 130,000 wagons
###2688 and 250,000 tons of rail were destroyed without sentiment.
###2700 David Shepherd is one of Britain's most well known artists,
###2703 who made his name painting wildlife.
###2705 In 1967, he dropped everything to paint the last days of steam.
###2710 In my days as an artist, I had suddenly realised, like everybody else in England
###2715 who were interested in railways,
###2717 that it was going, and going fast.
###2718 And through the eyes of a painter, I thought,
###2721 I have to do something about this.
###2722 So I got involved with the steam sheds,
###2724 Nine Elms and Guildford particularly.
###2725 Nine Elms shed was more full of railway enthusiasts
###2728 than it was of railwaymen.
###2729 It was clamouring with railway enthusiasts,
###2731 trying to experience in one way or another the end of steam.
###2734 There was no control. I felt sorry for BR, as they
###2736 were trying to run a railway while all this was going on!
###2739 This one is actually one of my favourites,
###2741 in the sense that it's one of the toughest I did.
###2743 Three different angles of a circle, which is in itself bloody difficult.
###2747 Wheels that way, body that way.
###2749 But that's the most valuable part of this painting,
###2752 and I don't believe you could get that colour,
###2754 sensitivity of colour, in a photograph.
###2756 And the dirt, lovely, much more exciting than a red buffer beam.
###2760 I don't paint happy railway pictures,
###2762 shafts of sunlight coming through a soot-encrusted hole in the roof.
###2765 Everything was falling apart, little plays of light
###2768 on the oil on the shed floor.
###2769 People say, what's that white stripe?
###2771 It's the light, the sunlight catching the edge of the inspection pit.
###2776 You know, you have to go in and see it, to do that,
###2779 it never would have occurred to me.
###2781 Happy days, wonderful days. The sheer hell of doing it was,
###2784 oh, God, the painting I did at Wilson's sheds,
###2786 the snow was coming through the roof.
###2788 And it was black by the time it hit the ground!
###2790 The main thing was, I was trying to record the last
###2792 days of steam through the eyes of an artist, rather than a photographer.
###2795 It's the colours that were interesting, not the shape of
###2797 the wheels, that didn't matter, cos the camera did that.
###2799 That's why those sketches are so valuable to me.
###2802 They're not worth any money, but they're irreplaceable to me,
###2805 because they were done in the heat of the moment, the dying days of steam.
###2809 One of my many rushed visits to Guildford shed,
###2812 just down the road from where we lived.
###2814 Just at the right moment, I saw this loco,
###2816 half in the sun and half in the shadow, just by chance,
###2818 and I thought, what an opportunity, with the subtle colours
###2822 on a dirty engine, in the sun and in the shade.
###2825 And also, I noticed they had cleaned the number around so that they could
###2829 at least identify the number of the engine,
###2832 otherwise that would have been invisible like everything else.
###2835 I think it was premature urge to, of necessity,
###2838 go into diesels and electrics.
###2840 Steam could have lasted longer, but it wouldn't have done
###2842 because you wouldn't get the people to put up with it now,
###2845 all the dirt and everything I've described.
###2847 People don't want to get filthy dirty when they go to London,
###2850 or anywhere for that matter. So it would have died, and it had to die,
###2853 but it was just disgusting the way it went out. Get rid of it, filthy.
###2856 We should have been proud of our steam engines.
###2862 As the engines were removed, jobs went, too.
###2865 Some of the men who operated them, the drivers and the firemen,
###2868 were retrained, but many found themselves
###2871 redundant, skilled in a job that belonged in the last century.
###2877 Most of the drivers actually went to Oxford to work,
###2882 but I think nearly all the firemen left.
###2885 Yeah, it was a sad day.
###2887 It's... You know, nothing we could do about it.
###2893 When it closed, I started working on building sites,
###2897 you know, and erm...whatever jobs you could get, because
###2901 you end up with what you thought you were, a skilled man
###2906 when you was a fireman, you found you had no skills whatsoever.
###2911 Steam needed to come to an end.
###2914 I suppose the issue is, did it need to come to an end in 1968?
###2918 The answer is probably no.
###2920 There was a determined assault on steam locomotion
###2924 in the Beeching period.
###2925 Having been slower than many European countries
###2930 to phase out steam, we suddenly embarked on a headlong rush
###2935 to get rid of steam from 1963 to 1968.
###2938 And I think that was unfortunate,
###2940 because I think the diesel alternative wasn't always there.
###2944 I mean, you've got to understand that when you go from steam
###2948 to diesel, you've got to go overnight.
###2951 You've got to stop all your coaling plants, you've got to stop all your
###2955 water points, you've got to retrain all the drivers.
###2958 It's crazy to run a double system.
###2960 And Beeching's genius was he realised that.
###2963 He'd got to retrain all his drivers at one go,
###2966 you'd got to abandon steam, you couldn't let it dribble on.
###2969 It did dribble on in various areas of the country.
###2972 But essentially,
###2974 the conversion of a railway from one form of locomotion to another
###2977 has to be overnight, or you're doubling everything.
###2980 And that's very, very expensive.
###2983 On 11 August 1968, the fires were lit
###2986 for the final passenger train to be pulled by steam on the main line.
###2992 It was know as the 15 guineas special,
###2995 because a ticket to ride that train cost 15 guineas.
###2999 And it was a train that went from Liverpool to Manchester,
###3005 then to Hellifield, and over the Settle-Carlisle line to Carlisle.
###3012 And it was pulled by two types of engine, one type called the
###3015 Black Five, which ended up being the major workhorse at the end of steam.
###3020 And the last express passenger engine,
###3024 which was a Pacific called Oliver Cromwell.
###3039 But 1968 was not the end of steam.
###3041 Though most engines lay rusting in scrap yards,
###3045 a steam revival lay ahead.
###3047 And the centre of that resurrection
###3050 was a scrap yard in Barry in Wales,
###3051 where many of the engines had been sent.
###3054 All the way through the 1950s and '60s, when steam was being run down,
###3059 the scrap yards of Britain were buzzing with gas axes, because,
###3062 you know, they had a lot of engines to get through.
###3066 And steam engines are made of very thick steel.
###3068 Now, one of the scrap yards was called Barry Scrap Yard,
###3072 it was owned by a guy called Dai Woodham, who got, I think,
###3075 approaching 200 engines into his yard, but at the time,
###3079 was cutting up wagons and coaches,
###3083 had enough of those to be getting on with.
###3086 The Government announced
###3088 that there was to be a £250 million programme
###3092 to modernise British Rail.
###3096 And I thought, "Well, that's a gravy train! I'd better get on it!"
###3100 And by the time the end of the '60s came along,
###3103 preservation societies that had been set up
###3105 after the end of steam were beginning to have enough money
###3109 to buy individual engines.
###3110 And Barry Scrap Yard was the last scrap yard
###3112 where they were left in any number. So, suddenly,
###3115 Dai was getting phone calls from preservation societies
###3118 saying, "Can we buy that engine back from you, we want to restore it?"
###3121 And, you know, obviously, Dai was gonna make a few quid out of that,
###3125 probably a bit more than scrap value.
###3127 So he went, "Yeah."
###3128 And it saved him the trouble of having to cut them up.
###3131 And over a 25-year period,
###3133 every single engine in that yard was bought by a preservation society.
###3140 Without Barry scrap yard, actually, the preservation industry wouldn't
###3144 be that big, because there wouldn't be enough engines to run on it.
###3148 I had my easel in Barry's scrap yard.
###3151 That engine will probably be running now on a preserved railway.
###3154 And look at the boiler cladding had burst open,
###3157 and white asbestos, we were chucking it about.
###3160 Terrifying to think
###3161 what we were doing in those days.
###3163 But what an end to a steam engine. But she was saved by someone.
###3166 David Shepherd didn't just paint the steam engines that he loved.
###3171 He bought several locomotives
###3173 and began the long process of restoring them.
###3177 And look at this thing here.
###3180 It's rather pathetic when you think about it,
###3182 cos these things live, don't they?
###3184 Compared with a diesel, they have life.
###3186 Something's got to be done, you know, we'll have to save some of these.
###3192 And I went round to their office,
###3194 their office was in the guard's van body,
###3196 next to his Rolls-Royce, the whole thing was so funny, his Rolls-Royce,
###3200 covered in oil, it was marvellous.
###3202 I said, "I've come for some spares." He said, "OK, if you're fair,
###3205 "and you treat us properly, take what you want."
###3208 And we borrowed their oxyacetylene.
###3210 But for £110, I think I got a whole set of coupling rods
###3213 and a mechanical lubricator, which would cost thousands to build now.
###3216 He said, "What have you got in the back of your estate car?"
###3220 I said, "I've got a mechanical lubricator." "What's that?"
###3222 He didn't know what it was. It was just hidden money to him.
###3224 He gave it a push, and he said 12s 6d.
###3227 So I gave him a quid and he gave us the change!
###3230 I mean, those days were unreal.
###3232 And this particular example, which is pretty rough,
###3238 but I forecast that when the preservationists
###3243 are finished with it, she'll be like the day she was built.
###3247 Magic. Pure magic.
###3251 I mean, steam hasn't come to an end,
###3253 it was the beginning of the enthusiasts'
###3256 railways, and really that is a tremendous story in its own right.
###3260 It's a story that over the last 40 years has grown to include over 100
###3265 separate heritage railways with 1,300 working steam locomotives.
###3272 Six million visitors annually
###3274 is proof that the public are still in love with steam.
###3278 Have your tickets ready, please.
###3280 Certainly, railway enthusiasm in Great Britain is...
###3283 It's an industry now. It's huge.
###3286 Literally millions of people travel on preserved lines
###3289 or preserved steam trains every weekend.
###3291 There are hundreds of thousands of people who are members of a society,
###3296 or at least part of the wider circle
###3299 of steam preservation societies in this country. It is huge.
###3304 These are extraordinary enterprises, really,
###3308 these are essentially amateurs, railway enthusiasts
###3312 in the best sense of that word.
###3314 People who are seeing part of British life disappearing,
###3318 and who decide to do something about it.
###3320 To preserve it in some shape or form, and to use their own time,
###3325 their own money, their own energy to do precisely that. And they succeed.
###3330 One the biggest success stories in railway preservation
###3334 is the Great Western Society, based at Didcot,
###3337 and started by the Southall boys.
###3340 And money was still coming in!
###3342 We'd bought the engine, we'd bought the coach,
###3345 and then I suppose we started getting greedy!
###3347 What else should we do? And in the end it began to...
###3350 Not only engines and coaches, it was the artefacts, as you say.
###3355 People began to collect and forward on to us
###3358 or steer us in the direction of, you know...
###3361 The Southall boys gradually assembled
###3364 one of the finest railway collections in the world.
###3367 24 steam locomotives stand alongside more than 80 wagons and coaches,
###3373 and even signal boxes. The Great Western Society
###3377 is now the second biggest tourist attraction in Oxfordshire.
###3382 Different bell codes.
###3384 Different means of operation.
###3386 But then again you'd think that this box had been here for ever.
###3389 The love of steam is no longer confined
###3392 to looking back at the past.
###3394 It's August 1st 2008 in Darlington.
###3398 After 18 years, and funded by private donations to the tune of
###3404 £3 million, the brand new
###3405 A1 Class Tornado is finally ready to be launched.
###3418 For me, it's the culmination of a lifetime's ambition.
###3421 When I was at school and bored,
###3423 I used to draw steam locomotives like this in my rough book.
###3426 Subsequently, I've worked on restoring them,
###3429 building models of them, and the chance to actually
###3432 build a full size one, here in 2008,
###3434 for me at the age of 57, I just find it unbelievable.
###3438 It's really a great privilege
###3440 and I'm very pleased to have had this chance, and to have had all the
###3443 support that we've had to enable it to happen.
###3447 It's the 40th anniversary of the end of steam.
###3449 It's the 60th anniversary of the first A1 entering service.
###3463 HORN BLOWS
###3470 It's been 40 years since the last steam passenger train
###3473 ran on a mainline in this country.
###3478 With the launch of Tornado, steam has again found a new lease of life.
###3490 It's good, it's working, it's doing what it's supposed to do.
###3494 And hopefully she's putting on a good show for the crowd.
###3500 I can feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing up at the moment,
###3503 and the eyes are moistening.
###3508 # There's an engine at the station
###3511 # And the whistle blows my name
###3513 # It's callin' callin' callin'
###3515 # Come and get aboard the train
###3518 # My baby's gone and I'm alone to live in misery
###3523 # I'm gonna call and make a reservation for me
###3528 # Gonna ride a blue train
###3530 # Gonna ride a blue train. #
