10
0:0:42,22 --> 0:0:46,5
gonna be in chicken heaven, I'm gonna be happy,
you're gonna have a new recipe and you're


11
0:0:46,5 --> 0:0:52,5
gonna be able to get that recipe here in the
description box.


12
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:55,79
What I want you to do is do the rub because
the rubs really important because we're gonna


13
0:0:55,79 --> 0:0:59,71
get the seasoning onto the chicken first.
So I want a teaspoon of each of those bad


14
0:0:59,71 --> 0:1:4,519
boys in there and then Lee wait to put the
flour in, we're gonna put it in there.


15
0:1:4,519 --> 0:1:11,3
Then, can we get the lemon sliced up. Squeeze
it all into there and then all the honey into there.


16
0:1:11,3 --> 0:1:11,99
Got you.


17
0:1:11,99 --> 0:1:15,219
Crack on boys, looking good.
Now what we're gonna do is we're gonna do


18
0:1:15,219 --> 0:1:18,909
the chicken. So we've got these chicken legs
and what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna cut


19
0:1:18,909 --> 0:1:23,979
through. So all you do is you just cut down
and then just where the ligament is, here,


20
0:1:23,979 --> 0:1:28,13
you just wanna cut through there so we're
just gonna cut through and then just take


21
0:1:28,13 --> 0:1:34,719
off the spare bits of fat and we're just breaking
them into those nice pieces of chicken.


22
0:1:34,719 --> 0:1:40,0
So just get there.


23
0:1:40,0 --> 0:1:42,4
Ok, so we're just getting that in there now


24
0:1:42,4 --> 0:1:45,69
and that needs to marinade in there for 8
hours.


25
0:1:45,69 --> 0:1:46,7
But John I'm hungry!
8 hours?!


26
0:1:46,7 --> 0:1:48,4
What?!
We have a gig!


27
0:1:48,4 --> 0:1:50,969
Easy boys!
Good things come to those that wait, you know


28
0:1:50,969 --> 0:1:56,5
that! I talked you through this.


29
0:1:56,5 --> 0:1:58,899
So it's been 8 hours later and we're ready


30
0:1:58,899 --> 0:2:5,13
and fresh to take it to the next stage. And
so, what we're gonna do is, it's marinated


31
0:2:5,13 --> 0:2:8,78
in its honey and lemon loving and now we're
gonna put the rest of the ingredients in.


32
0:2:8,78 --> 0:2:15,519
So, corn starch, you want about a tsp of that.
Then, we want some more Cayenne pepper, another


33
0:2:15,519 --> 0:2:20,739
tsp. We want some smoked paprika. Oh that
stuff just takes it to the next level. Then


34
0:2:20,739 --> 0:2:25,939
the onion powder really, really takes it up.
And then the garlic powder is amazing.


35
0:2:25,939 --> 0:2:33,69
And we just wanna scrunch that in. Ok. And
then flour. Now you want it to be, the majority


36
0:2:33,69 --> 0:2:38,1
of it needs to be flour. Ok, and then we're
just gonna move that around and get all that


37
0:2:38,1 --> 0:2:44,39
beautifully mixed in. So we'll just mix all
those ingredients in and then we take the


38
0:2:44,39 --> 0:2:52,4
chicken and just get it in, drain off the
excess and get that into the flour. And then


39
0:2:52,4 --> 0:2:57,2
just get that all mixed around. You wanna
make sure that it's fully coated, like this


40
0:2:57,2 --> 0:3:1,68
bad boy here, and make sure that, this is
the important bit now, this is how you're


41
0:3:1,68 --> 0:3:5,319
gonna get a really good coating on your chicken
because you gotta make sure you leave it for


42
0:3:5,319 --> 0:3:9,989
half an hour just so it kinda is not totally
dry, it's getting a bit damp, then it's perfect.


43
0:3:9,989 --> 0:3:12,5
It looks good to me John!
Oh yes!


44
0:3:12,5 --> 0:3:17,859
Ok, chicken is ready to go in. So, drop them
in. and you see how they're getting a sizzle


45
0:3:17,859 --> 0:3:20,319
straight away.
Can you hear that boys?! Oh yeah!


46
0:3:20,319 --> 0:3:21,969
That's the sound of love!
Yes it is!


47
0:3:21,969 --> 0:3:30,0

48
0:3:30,0 --> 0:3:33,64
