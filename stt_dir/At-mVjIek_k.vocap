###16 SHANE SMITH: We met some crazy characters yesterday.
###19 I think the reason why they are so eccentric is because
###22 it's so oppressive here.
###23 It's so stark and heavy, and they're worried about the
###26 secret police, the FSB coming to get them, that they hide in
###30 their eccentricities.
###31 They're crazy guys with crazy hair and big long beards.
###34 In America, it's like sort of Hollywood
###36 and then indie films.
###37 Here, it's crazy people making crazy films based on very
###42 far-out intellectual theory.
###46 We're here to shoot a film today.
###48 And this is where we're going to shoot today, which is an
###51 old style in this block of flats.
###53 It's really stark, and cold, and gray, and oppressive.
###57 It reeks vaguely of shit, people picking garbage.
###60 And you say this is the most expensive city on Earth.
###63 
###67 ANDRE SILVESTROV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###69 
###75 SHANE SMITH: Right.
###77 ANDRE SILVESTROV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###79 
###88 SHANE SMITH: I wanted to understand exactly how
###90 Alcho-Cinema was a subset of Parallel Cinema, but they sort
###93 of just grabbed me and threw me in the room.
###95 What am I interviewing them about?
###98 We were just, OK, here we go.
###100 
###104 [TOASTING IN RUSSIAN]
###105 
###109 SHANE SMITH: OK, you're the leader.
###111 How are you?
###112 Nice to meet you.
###115 Oh, thank you very much.
###117 Oh, nice to meet you.
###118 We came here to shoot an Alcho-Cinema film.
###122 They brought all of the characters, set up the set.
###125 They had a director.
###125 They had a producer, everybody--
###128 no cameras.
###129 It's kind of amazing.
###130 [CHANTING IN RUSSIAN]
###132 
###139 SHANE SMITH: What are you doing?
###141 What are you protesting?
###142 MALE SPEAKER: We here drink for the crisis.
###146 Stop the crisis!
###147 SHANE SMITH: Stop the crisis.
###149 Stop the crisis.
###150 
###152 MALE SPEAKER: We are against the crisis, and we don't want
###155 it anymore.
###156 Stop the crisis!
###157 MALE SPEAKERS: Stop the crisis!
###158 SHANE SMITH: Stop the crisis.
###159 You have to drink vodka then pickle, vodka then pickle,
###162 vodka then fish, which, by the way, made the room reek.
###165 Because there's only pickled fish, some sort of meat,
###168 smoked cheese, pickled garlic.
###170 That with lots of booze, cigarettes, and the BO of
###173 eight stinky men, it was like a wall.
###176 And that's what Alcho-Cinema seems to be--
###179 an excuse to get wasted.
###180 
###191 I've had so much vodka in about 14 minutes that I'm
###195 pouring with sweat right now.
###196 
###203 SHANE SMITH: Capitalists.
###205 
###208 SHANE SMITH: Death to the capitalists.
###211 Bitches.
###212 What's amazing about it is, it's not about communism, or
###215 capitalism, or socialism, or anything else.
###219 Because they don't know what it's about.
###220 They don't know what a global crisis is.
###222 Russia was closed for so long that this is all new to them.
###226 It's like what the fuck is going on?
###228 We don't know what's going on, but we're against it.
###230 So we're going to protest it, because protesting leads to
###233 social change.
###234 I guess so.
###235 Not where we're from.
###236 [MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN]
###237 
###257 SHANE SMITH: So the more and more people we met, the more
###261 difficult we were finding pegging down Parallel Cinema
###264 and what it was.
###266 We knew there was a lot of booze involved.
###267 There's a lot of crazy characters.
###269 But everyone said oh, you have to go see Yvgeni Yufit.
###271 He's still making films, and he was the founding father of
###274 the St. Petersburg division of Parallel Cinema.
###277 So we went to St. Petersburg to check
###279 out what he was doing.
###282 We're on an old Soviet train going towards St. Petersburg.
###287 It's about 6:00 in the morning.
###290 I'm very tired.
###291 I've heard about Yvgeni's films and
###296 they're pretty crazy.
###297 I'm a little bit nervous.
###298 Now where's this here?
###300 Is that St. Petersburg?
###301 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it's St. Petersburg.
###301 SHANE SMITH: We're going here.
###303 
###307 So we arrived at St. Petersburg, and it was a
###308 really surrealistic scene because there were just Army
###311 guys everywhere and packs of wild dogs roaming throughout
###315 the train station.
###316 
###330 We're here in St. Petersburg after the
###332 long trip from Moscow.
###335 Yvgeni's got an exhibition here at the Russian Museum of
###339 Ethnography.
###339 And we're going to go meet him and check out some of his
###341 artwork, and then, hopefully, make a film with him, which
###344 means I have to lie down with thousands of naked bodies and
###348 maybe have sex with them.
###350 Inside--
###351 it's an old palace of Peter the Great's--
###353 is this massive floor-to-ceiling, beautiful,
###355 pink marble room, priceless room.
###357 Hello?
###357 Hello?
###358 Hello?
###359 
###361 Hello.
###362 YVGENI YUFIT: Hello.
###363 SHANE SMITH: Yvgeni Yufit?
###364 YVGENI YUFIT: Yes.
###364 SHANE SMITH: Pleasure to meet you.
###366 YVGENI YUFIT: Nice to meet you.
###367 SHANE SMITH: When we asked Yvgeni about his paintings, he
###370 explained that they were inspired by a true event in
###372 Russian history where the military experimented with
###375 making super soldiers by breeding men with apes.
###380 And if you think that sounds fucked up, wait
###382 until you see his films.
###384 
###393 Now, Yvgeni's sub-strata of Parallel Cinema is called
###398 Necrorealism.
###399 Now, during the socialist realism period, you couldn't
###403 show death, you couldn't show bums, you couldn't show
###406 unhappiness.
###408 So Yvgeni just puts all of that into his films.
###411 
###416 Were you ever worried that you would get in trouble from the
###420 state when you were making your films?
###421 YVGENI YUFIT: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###423 
###445 SHANE SMITH: So he asked us, actually, hey, do you want to
###448 make a movie?
###449 And we said we'd like to do that more than anything.
###451 YVGENI YUFIT:
###453 
###459 SHANE SMITH: Perfect.
###459 YVGENI YUFIT: OK, thank you.
###460 SHANE SMITH: Where Yvgeni took us next was one of the most
###462 amazing things I've ever seen.
###464 It's the old headquarters of the Soviet Documentary
###467 Filmmaking Union.
###469 Looks like it's straight out of the '30s.
###476 And it's just this huge old building with floor-to-ceiling
###481 old stock, old footage, just racks of 35-mm cameras, and
###486 nobody else, just Yvgeni.
###488 He has the keys.
###489 YVGENI YUFIT: Like machine gun.
###490 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, it's the Kalashnikov of cameras.
