###59 FRANK PINELLO: My name is Frank Pinello, and my place is
###62 Best Pizza.
###65 Best Pizza's pretty much just a by the slice pizzeria.
###67 Very much a New York-style place where you could walk in,
###70 grab a slice of pizza, grab something to drink, and be out
###73 the door in five minutes if that's what you want.
###76 We're lucky enough to have a 100-year-old wood fire oven,
###79 so we cook the big 20-inch pies in about four minutes.
###81 
###84 Pizza time.
###87 I'm just going to go ahead and make you a white pizza.
###89 It's like one of our signature pies over here.
###93 When we first started making it, we were playing around
###95 with like some arugula and stuff like that on it, and
###97 then we decided that the white pie is about the ricotta
###100 cheese, so let's not do anything too crazy.
###103 Let's let the ricotta cheese kind of be the star the show.
###106 And we do these caramelized onions that we let sit on the
###109 raw dough and caramelize for a long time.
###110 It's how that sweetness that people always keep talking
###113 about coming in.
###115 
###120 Pizza came from Napoli.
###121 And when all those southern Italian immigrants started
###123 coming over to New York, everybody started opening up
###126 these small pizzerias, and it kept a lot of those values of
###130 using really fresh ingredients and having really great
###133 techniques.
###134 And as time went on, their sons took it over or they sold
###137 the pizzerias, and I think people started realizing, oh,
###139 you know we could just use shitty pepperoni and shitty
###142 mozzarella cheese and make a whole lot more money.
###145 We started realizing, man, this pizza isn't as good as it
###147 used to be.
###148 So when we finally got in here, it was important to me
###151 to try to preserve some of those old techniques and those
###154 ideas of using the best stuff that you possibly can and hope
###158 that we'll make it up.
###159 
###164 I know a lot of people love pizza across the world-- you
###166 know what I I mean-- across the country, but I'm not so
###168 sure that anyone has done it better than Brooklyn--
###171 like Napoli, like anywhere.
###173 Pizza and Brooklyn go hand in hand.
###175 I thought it would only be right to bring you to
###176 Bensonhurst, of course.
###177 Billy.
###178 Billy.
###179 My partner in crime is Bill.
###181 Bill is a delivery guy here, but we spend a lot of time
###184 together out at the bars, so I figured I'd bring
###186 Bill along as well.
###189 I've worked in pizzerias my entire life.
###191 Delivery is a huge part of pizza places, and the second I
###194 met Bill, I knew it was a match made in heaven.
###199 BILL: I've been a bike messenger since 1982.
###202 FRANK PINELLO: I've seen Bill take eight pies in a bag, and
###204 to me, like that's mind blowing.
###206 This guy rides a fixed gear bike with no brakes on it.
###209 BILL: I have a break.
###212 FRANK PINELLO: And sometimes it'll be like torrential
###214 downpour, and he'll be fucking soaked to the bone, but he
###218 gets the job done, man.
###219 But we get the job done.
###222 I think it was Brandon's from the Bergess's to get you a
###225 cape, and I was like, fuck yes.
###227 BILL: I told him I would totally rock the cape.
###232 FRANK PINELLO: For me, the home base for pizza--
###234 18th avenue in Bensonhurst is a old Sicilian neighborhood,
###236 and they got some great pizzerias.
###238 
###249 J&V Pizza is a great by the slice pizzeria that's on the
###252 corner of 64th Street and 18th Avenue.
###255 Like the square slice at J&V is what their known for.
###259 As a kid, I used to always go there and scrape up some
###261 change, grab a square slice from J&V and an Italian ice,
###265 and my afternoon was made.
###267 What's up, Pop?
###268 Can I get four squares please?
###272 Thank you, Papa.
###274 Bill, sit down.
###276 Let's eat.
###277 
###279 A proper square Sicilian slice is a nice thick, fluffy slice,
###283 a crusty bottom, a nice fluffy middle, a saucy,
###287 cheesy top to it.
###288 So it's like three different components.
###290 And when you get that ratio right, that's a
###294 good Sicilian slice.
###295 BILL: Crispity crunchy on the bottom.
###297 Nice and fluffy in the middle.
###298 
###301 [INAUDIBLE].
###302 FRANK PINELLO: The cheese is really good.
###303 You can tell, like, this is one of those places that just
###306 kept the quality up throughout the years,
###308 you know what I mean.
###308 You could look around and see how many pizza boxes they
###311 have, and you know that these guys are doing really good
###313 business and that they're a staple in the neighborhood.
###314 
###319 From J&V, we want to DaVinci's.
###321 Thank you, man.
###322 Take care, buddy.
###324 And that was sort of like always the toss up.
###326 Like when we had a couple bucks in our pocket or my
###328 grandmother maybe didn't feel like cooking and wanted to
###330 order some pizzas, it was always like, all right, where
###332 are we going, J&V or DaVinci's?
###335 Here we are.
###337 The world famous DaVinci's Pizzeria.
###339 
###347 Every classic pizzeria offers their version of a square and
###350 their version of a round, and J&V for me was the square
###355 size, DaVinci's was the round.
###356 
###361 And as you can see, these guys do a nice job.
###364 Beautiful crust, nice and thick.
###368 Let's give it a shot.
###369 
###372 ANGELO GNERRE: It's always been the same.
###373 The recipe hasn't changed.
###374 I just try to perfect it.
###376 Maybe I add a little of this, a little of that.
###378 I use different types of flour to give it that color, that
###381 consistency, that flavor, that crunchiness.
###385 FRANK PINELLO: Classic.
###385 These guys know how to do it right.
###387 
###391 So we were feeling pretty full after DaVinci's--
###393 Thank you so much, man.
###395 --and it was only right to bring you guys to Villabate.
###398 It's just like Sicily rolled up into a ball and like thrown
###402 in like a store front.
###403 
###411 They make great espresso, like really, really tasty, and the
###414 flavor of the coffee when it was in your mouth.
###418 When I worked for a chef that I really loved, what I would
###420 do is come here and by them a dozen cannolis and bring it to
###423 them as a treat.
###424 And the second they tasted it, they knew that it was like the
###427 primo stuff.
###428 Here you go--
###429 Sicilian-style cannoli.
###431 This place does it the best.
###433 
###436 Thank you very much.
###437 Grazie [INAUDIBLE].
###440 Amazing.
###441 
###443 Come on, Bill.
###445 BILL: --being on a TV show right now.
###447 It's called "Munchies."
###450 FRANK PINELLO: I lived in Brooklyn till I was about 10
###451 years old, and then my family moved out to Long Island.
###453 On the weekends, you would always sort of drive back to
###456 Brooklyn to spend the weekend with my grandmother.
###459 And as soon as you would kind of like approach the steps,
###461 you could like smell the aroma of what my grandmother was
###463 been cooking for like the last three or four hours.
###466 Oh yeah.
###467 My grandmother would buzz us in and the door would open,
###470 walk down the long hallway, and that aroma starts getting
###473 a little bit more strong.
###476 DIANE PINELLO: Frank?
###476 FRANK PINELLO: Yes.
###477 DIANE PINELLO: Hi.
###478 Shower us with hugs and kisses and then walk right through
###482 the little doorway, and bam-- the table would just be
###484 stocked with food.
###486 BILL: Oh wow.
###487 FRANK PINELLO: You got some food?
###488 DIANE PINELLO: Well, it's 8 o'clock and you can't keep a
###489 room full of Italians--
###491 FRANK PINELLO: Oh, what's up, Thomas?
###494 What's going on with everybody?
###496 I had never imagined I would take that walk with Bill.
###499 Hi.
###499 How are you?
###500 
###506 Everybody sit down.
###507 Eat.
###508 
###511 BILL: Oh sweet.
###512 Thank you very much.
###513 FRANK PINELLO: We talked a lot about pizza today.
###515 This is the style of pizza that I grew up eating--
###517 country-style grandma's pizza.
###519 My grandmother stuffed this one with some tomatoes, some
###523 caramelized onions, possibly some anchovies in there--
###526 I haven't tasted it yet, so I'm not sure.
###527 But this is the way we do it.
###529 Full table full of food, and eat until we're stuffed.
###531 
###536 My grandmother put out a lot of dishes.
###537 I know she knew that camera was coming, but I'll be honest
###539 with you, it's always like that.
###541 
###544 Classic Sicilian pasta right here.
###548 Put a little bit of bread crumbs as a topping.
###551 A lot of people in Sicily couldn't afford cheese as a
###554 topping, so you see bread crumb pretty often on top of
###557 pasta, which it's starch on starch but like the texture
###560 combination goes really, really well.
###561 
###567 PASQUALINA PINELLO: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]
###569 FRANK PINELLO: Yeah I know.
###570 He needs to eat, right, Nonna?
###572 He needs to eat.
###575 PASQUALINA PINELLO: You like it?
###576 You love it?
###576 BILL: I love it.
###577 I love it.
###577 PASQUALINA PINELLO: You eat it.
###578 I love you.
###578 I love you [INAUDIBLE].
###581 FRANK PINELLO: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]
###582 
###589 STEVE PINELLO: He loved to eat, and he was like around
###592 the kitchen when my wife, Diane, was cooking.
###595 He would actually advise us as to what spice to use
###599 every now and then.
###600 He would kind of put his own two cents into it as to say.
###606 FRANK PINELLO: My family was never rich by any means, you
###608 know what I mean.
###609 We always grew up in apartments in Brooklyn, but
###612 the one thing that we did right was eat.
###613 The commitment to food that I think Sicilian people have in
###616 general, it's crazy.
###617 It's amazing, and I feel lucky that I was born into it.
###621 BILL: Woohoo.
###622 The Pinellos rock.
###625 All right.
###625 Thanks again you all.
###626 It's great to see you.
###628 STEVE PINELLO: Bill, be careful, brother.
###630 BILL: All right.
###630 STEVE PINELLO: All right.
###632 Keep those wheels oiled.
###633 
###640 FRANK PINELLO: After we left grandma's house, we came back
###642 to Best Pizza.
###644 
###648 And we had some friends waiting for us here, and we
###650 did a meatball pizza, which is starting to become a popular
###652 pie here, especially towards the end of the night when
###655 people come in hammered from the bar.
###657 
###660 We get our meat from Pat Lafrieda.
###662 It's 50% short rib, 50% brisket.
###664 All that fat is flavor, so we want to make sure that we get
###668 all that nice, beautiful, clear fat mixed in with those
###672 meatballs and back on top of the pizza.
###674 Pizza is like the perfect accompaniment for drinking.
###679 You come into a pizzeria, you have a few beers, some pizza.
###682 You get yourself a nice base before you go out to the bar
###685 and usually get hungry at the end of the night.
###688 If you're done partying with your buds, coming back and
###690 having a nice fresh pie out of the oven is to me-- it's like
###694 you can't go wrong.
###695 It's beautiful.
###698 -Who needs a napkin?

###707 FRANK PINELLO: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]
###710 Nonna, what are you, pounding?
###712 To my grandfather, Nonu, we miss you.
###714 Get better.
###716 In the hospital.
###717 To Munchies--
###718 uno, due, tre.
###719 PINELLO FAMILY: Salud.
