4
0:0:15,4 --> 0:0:16,81
EDDY MORETTI: Al Gore has
spoken out against the


5
0:0:16,81 --> 0:0:18,96
development of the oil sands.


6
0:0:18,96 --> 0:0:22,35
As far as he's concerned, it's
like a junkie tapping a vein


7
0:0:22,35 --> 0:0:24,11
in their toe.


8
0:0:24,11 --> 0:0:27,8
He thinks we're addicted to
oil, and the tar sands are


9
0:0:27,8 --> 0:0:28,91
merely perpetuating
that addiction.


10
0:0:28,91 --> 0:0:32,28
Ralph Klein doesn't,
really, agree.


11
0:0:32,28 --> 0:0:34,3
You have a reputation
of being a straight


12
0:0:34,3 --> 0:0:37,75
talking kind of guy.


13
0:0:37,75 --> 0:0:42,13
You and Al Gore have been,
you know, butting heads--


14
0:0:42,13 --> 0:0:42,69
RALPH KLEIN: No, no, no.


15
0:0:42,69 --> 0:0:43,82
We aren't butting heads.


16
0:0:43,82 --> 0:0:45,57
First of all, I'm
out of politics,


17
0:0:45,57 --> 0:0:46,82
and he's out of politics.


18
0:0:46,82 --> 0:0:48,76
And hopefully, he'll stay
out of politics--


19
0:0:48,76 --> 0:0:49,54
EDDY MORETTI: But he,
you know, if you--


20
0:0:49,54 --> 0:0:51,52
RALPH KLEIN: --and
I will, too.


21
0:0:51,52 --> 0:0:54,19
EDDY MORETTI: What did Gore
actually say that got your


22
0:0:54,19 --> 0:0:55,7
back up so much?


23
0:0:55,7 --> 0:0:56,72
RALPH KLEIN: The--


24
0:0:56,72 --> 0:1:0,66
EDDY MORETTI: He equated the
industry to a drug pusher that


25
0:1:0,66 --> 0:1:4,16
was satisfying America's fix.


26
0:1:4,16 --> 0:1:6,11
RALPH KLEIN: No, it's
not that at all.


27
0:1:6,11 --> 0:1:11,43
You know, well first of all,
he's of a different political


28
0:1:11,43 --> 0:1:12,95
bent than me.


29
0:1:12,95 --> 0:1:13,7
EDDY MORETTI: In what way?


30
0:1:13,7 --> 0:1:14,73
You're more right--


31
0:1:14,73 --> 0:1:15,195
RALPH KLEIN: Well, I'm a


32
0:1:15,195 --> 0:1:18,52
conservative, and he is a socialist.


33
0:1:18,52 --> 0:1:20,17
EDDY MORETTI: You don't think
his motive is to save the


34
0:1:20,17 --> 0:1:21,21
planet, or--


35
0:1:21,21 --> 0:1:22,96
RALPH KLEIN: No no, I don't
think his motive is that.


36
0:1:22,96 --> 0:1:25,75
His motive is-- he's
a politician.


37
0:1:25,75 --> 0:1:28,49
You know, the first question you
should ask him-- are you


38
0:1:28,49 --> 0:1:31,985
an environmentalist
or a politician.


39
0:1:31,985 --> 0:1:33,56
EDDY MORETTI: And you
think he'd answer--


40
0:1:33,56 --> 0:1:36,54
RALPH KLEIN: Well, he'll
say, "I am both."


41
0:1:36,54 --> 0:1:38,8
Well which one would--


42
0:1:38,8 --> 0:1:39,6
are you most of?


43
0:1:39,6 --> 0:1:42,31
Are you mostly a politician,
or are you mostly an


44
0:1:42,31 --> 0:1:43,65
environmentalist?


45
0:1:43,65 --> 0:1:46,27
EDDY MORETTI: You don't think
you could be both, today, in


46
0:1:46,27 --> 0:1:47,24
this world?


47
0:1:47,24 --> 0:1:49,37
RALPH KLEIN: Look it, I
have on my home, "an


48
0:1:49,37 --> 0:1:52,4
environmentalist lives
here." I was both.


49
0:1:52,4 --> 0:1:54,15
I was Minister of
the Environment.


50
0:1:54,15 --> 0:1:57,2
First of all, ask him what
kind of a car he drives.


51
0:1:57,2 --> 0:1:59,68
Secondly, ask him
if he recycles.


52
0:1:59,68 --> 0:2:1,29
EDDY MORETTI: Two things
should be said.


53
0:2:1,29 --> 0:2:4,887
One is that Al Gore seems to be
an expert on global warming


54
0:2:4,887 --> 0:2:5,12
and climate change.


55
0:2:5,12 --> 0:2:6,35
RALPH KLEIN: Well, no no.


56
0:2:6,35 --> 0:2:8,199
He is a policy wonk.


57
0:2:8,199 --> 0:2:10,41
He Is a policy wonk.


58
0:2:10,41 --> 0:2:14,14
He knows no more about
global warming--


59
0:2:14,14 --> 0:2:16,59
as a matter of fact, if he wants
to know about global


60
0:2:16,59 --> 0:2:22,48
warming, then perhaps the best
thing to do is to destroy the


61
0:2:22,48 --> 0:2:24,52
population of the world.


62
0:2:24,52 --> 0:2:24,82
Right?


63
0:2:24,82 --> 0:2:28,72
And then we would all
stop exhaling.


64
0:2:28,72 --> 0:2:28,95
Right--


65
0:2:28,95 --> 0:2:29,41
EDDY MORETTI: That--


66
0:2:29,41 --> 0:2:32,43
RALPH KLEIN: And CO2 is one of
the major greenhouse gases.


67
0:2:32,43 --> 0:2:34,23
EDDY MORETTI: So you don't
you believe in


68
0:2:34,23 --> 0:2:36,88
global warming as a--


69
0:2:36,88 --> 0:2:41,32
RALPH KLEIN: Here's what the
Province of Alberta believes.


70
0:2:41,32 --> 0:2:47,36
Accept the science, but also
accept that there is an


71
0:2:47,36 --> 0:2:49,52
economy to sustain.


72
0:2:49,52 --> 0:2:53,38
And accept the fact that we are
a carbon-based economy.


73
0:2:53,38 --> 0:2:56,13
EDDY MORETTI: Are you tired of
being judged by these people?


74
0:2:56,13 --> 0:2:58,64
Do you think they're
moralists?


75
0:2:58,64 --> 0:2:59,76
RALPH KLEIN: I think
they're moralists.


76
0:2:59,76 --> 0:3:2,29
I think that they have
a political agenda,


77
0:3:2,29 --> 0:3:3,86
which is not my agenda.


78
0:3:3,86 --> 0:3:4,71
EDDY MORETTI: Right.


79
0:3:4,71 --> 0:3:7,68
RALPH KLEIN: Be conscious
of the environment.


80
0:3:7,68 --> 0:3:11,81
Be conscious of clean water.


81
0:3:11,81 --> 0:3:14,1
EDDY MORETTI: The water in Fort
McMurray is interesting,


82
0:3:14,1 --> 0:3:18,3
because the industry sucks
so much water--


83
0:3:18,3 --> 0:3:18,68
RALPH KLEIN: Oh, no.


84
0:3:18,68 --> 0:3:19,74
It's not good.


85
0:3:19,74 --> 0:3:21,82
You know, and the tailings
ponds have always been--


86
0:3:21,82 --> 0:3:24,8
EDDY MORETTI: It looks bad, and
it probably smells bad.


87
0:3:24,8 --> 0:3:25,7
And you wouldn't want
to drink that water.


88
0:3:25,7 --> 0:3:27,73
RALPH KLEIN: No, you wouldn't
want to drink that water.


89
0:3:27,73 --> 0:3:28,55
Nobody would.


90
0:3:28,55 --> 0:3:29,95
EDDY MORETTI: But
you're not super


91
0:3:29,95 --> 0:3:31,64
concerned about those ponds.


92
0:3:31,64 --> 0:3:34,59
RALPH KLEIN: No, I'm not too
concerned, because the


93
0:3:34,59 --> 0:3:37,91
scientists and the PhDs and,
you know, the petroleum


94
0:3:37,91 --> 0:3:41,27
engineers and so on, are
working on solutions.


95
0:3:41,27 --> 0:3:42,89
EDDY MORETTI: You have a lot
of faith in science.


96
0:3:42,89 --> 0:3:43,16
RALPH KLEIN: --to clean
up the environment.


97
0:3:43,16 --> 0:3:45,44
Yeah, I do have a lot
of faith in science.


98
0:3:45,44 --> 0:3:50,36
And I have a lot of faith in the
very educated people who


99
0:3:50,36 --> 0:3:52,64
are involved in the industry,
right now.


100
0:3:52,64 --> 0:3:56,68



101
0:3:56,68 --> 0:3:59,51
EDDY MORETTI: So what do
they call this place?


102
0:3:59,51 --> 0:4:0,27
MALE SPEAKER: Borealis.


103
0:4:0,27 --> 0:4:1,772
EDDY MORETTI: Borealis.


104
0:4:1,772 --> 0:4:5,21
It kind of looks like a mall
meets a high school.


105
0:4:5,21 --> 0:4:6,552
MALE SPEAKER: [LAUGHTER]


106
0:4:6,552 --> 0:4:6,95
Yeah.


107
0:4:6,95 --> 0:4:8,652
EDDY MORETTI: Are there
stores inside?


108
0:4:8,652 --> 0:4:10,575
We're going in for class.


109
0:4:10,575 --> 0:4:14,66



110
0:4:14,66 --> 0:4:18,899
Well it's just a hub
of activity, here.


111
0:4:18,899 --> 0:4:20,99
It's pretty clean.


112
0:4:20,99 --> 0:4:23,36
It's not what I was expecting,
but also, they were saying


113
0:4:23,36 --> 0:4:24,95
this is one of the nicer ones.


114
0:4:24,95 --> 0:4:28,2
And you know, I guess there
isn't even enough of this


115
0:4:28,2 --> 0:4:31,79
housing, right now, so you're
lucky if you can get into one.


116
0:4:31,79 --> 0:4:33,28
Let's see what they're
reading--


117
0:4:33,28 --> 0:4:37,43

of course, From The


118
0:4:37,43 --> 0:4:39,8
Snows To The Sands.


119
0:4:39,8 --> 0:4:40,63
Are you from out west, too.


120
0:4:40,63 --> 0:4:40,84
MIKE: NO.


121
0:4:40,84 --> 0:4:42,734
I'm, actually, East Coast,
[INAUDIBLE].


122
0:4:42,734 --> 0:4:44,44

nice to meet you.


123

meet you--Mike.


124
0:4:45,215 --> 0:4:47,8
EDDY MORETTI: And how do
you like being up here?


125
0:4:47,8 --> 0:4:47,56
MIKE: Oh, it's good money.


126
0:4:47,56 --> 0:4:48,86
It's great [INAUDIBLE].


127
0:4:48,86 --> 0:4:51,1
EDDY MORETTI: And
how's the pay?


128
0:4:51,1 --> 0:4:52,51
MIKE: Pay is good,
work's good.


129
0:4:52,51 --> 0:4:53,315
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


130
0:4:53,315 --> 0:4:53,95
MIKE: Can't complain.


131
0:4:53,95 --> 0:4:55,92
You're living for free and
eating for free, right.


132
0:4:55,92 --> 0:4:57,19
EDDY MORETTI: Oh, living
for free, really?


133
0:4:57,19 --> 0:4:57,54
MIKE: Yeah, yeah.


134
0:4:57,54 --> 0:4:58,71
EDDY MORETTI: No
one pays, here?


135
0:4:58,71 --> 0:4:59,57
MIKE: No one pays, no.


136
0:4:59,57 --> 0:5:2,7
There's not a lot of
work back east, eh.


137
0:5:2,7 --> 0:5:3,85
So that's why most of us
come out here, so.


138
0:5:3,85 --> 0:5:5,63
EDDY MORETTI: And do a lot of
people manage to save a lot of


139
0:5:5,63 --> 0:5:7,27
money and bring it back home.


140
0:5:7,27 --> 0:5:9,72
MIKE: Depends on the
person, I guess.


141
0:5:9,72 --> 0:5:11,12
EDDY MORETTI: There isn't
anything up here, though.


142
0:5:11,12 --> 0:5:12,205
What are they spending it on?


143
0:5:12,205 --> 0:5:15,328
I mean, we've been traveling
around in this, you know--


144
0:5:15,328 --> 0:5:16,45
bar-- a night at the bar--


145
0:5:16,45 --> 0:5:18,55
MIKE: A night on the town,
it'll cost you $500.


146
0:5:18,55 --> 0:5:19,76
EDDY MORETTI: Really?


147
0:5:19,76 --> 0:5:19,98
$500?


148
0:5:19,98 --> 0:5:21,3
What's $500?


149
0:5:21,3 --> 0:5:23,52
A human being can't drink
$500 of booze.


150
0:5:23,52 --> 0:5:23,94
[LAUGHTER]


151
0:5:23,94 --> 0:5:25,33
EDDY MORETTI: What are
we talking about?


152
0:5:25,33 --> 0:5:28,2
MIKE: $500--I guess you
get the casino,


153
0:5:28,2 --> 0:5:30,71
your cabs, your liquor.


154
0:5:30,71 --> 0:5:33,685
there's the adult bars, right,
the strip clubs.


155
0:5:33,685 --> 0:5:35,96
You throw your money away
in there, pretty good.


156
0:5:35,96 --> 0:5:39,22
EDDY MORETTI: Well, that
sounds like fun.


157
0:5:39,22 --> 0:5:48,57
I mean it just seems like, you
know, odd for grown men to


158
0:5:48,57 --> 0:5:52,5
live like they're in a
dorm, a college dorm.


159
0:5:52,5 --> 0:5:54,88
But if they're making
a lot of money--


160
0:5:54,88 --> 0:5:57,505
Do they have hot tubs, here?


161
0:5:57,505 --> 0:5:57,601
MALE


162
0:5:57,601 --> 0:5:58,275
SPEAKER 2: No, [LAUGHTER]


163
0:5:58,275 --> 0:5:59,56
EDDY MORETTI: That could
be good, though.


164
0:5:59,56 --> 0:6:1,2
MALE SPEAKER 2: No, not
with 1,200 men, no.


165
0:6:1,2 --> 0:6:2,12
EDDY MORETTI: Oh yeah,
shit, sorry.


166
0:6:2,12 --> 0:6:5,19
You know what, I was thinking
about that.


167
0:6:5,19 --> 0:6:6,2
What's it like?


168
0:6:6,2 --> 0:6:6,45
MALE SPEAKER 2: Gym--


169
0:6:6,45 --> 0:6:7,68
I work in the gym.


170
0:6:7,68 --> 0:6:10,21
I'm on the computer, talk to
my family at home, and just


171
0:6:10,21 --> 0:6:11,78
try and go to a movie
downtown.


172
0:6:11,78 --> 0:6:14,4
But I try to stay away from the
bars and the casino and


173
0:6:14,4 --> 0:6:14,3
that, because that's just--


174
0:6:14,3 --> 0:6:14,75
EDDY MORETTI: Why?


175
0:6:14,75 --> 0:6:16,14
MALE SPEAKER 2: Why?


176
0:6:16,14 --> 0:6:19,3
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah, what's the
nightlife like, and what's the


177
0:6:19,3 --> 0:6:20,88
attitude and the--


178
0:6:20,88 --> 0:6:21,61
MALE SPEAKER 2: It's
rough here.


179
0:6:21,61 --> 0:6:22,65
It's downtown.


180
0:6:22,65 --> 0:6:24,62
You have to be careful of
yourself, where you go and


181
0:6:24,62 --> 0:6:26,37
what you do and what
you spend.


182
0:6:26,37 --> 0:6:26,46
EDDY MORETTI: Mhm.


183
0:6:26,46 --> 0:6:27,63
MALE SPEAKER 2: A buddy of mine
tried to-- almost got


184
0:6:27,63 --> 0:6:29,7
robbed there a couple of
weeks ago, got jumped.


185
0:6:29,7 --> 0:6:30,85
People make big money here.


186
0:6:30,85 --> 0:6:32,87
And if you don't have anywhere
to put it, you'll put a


187
0:6:32,87 --> 0:6:35,14
casino-- and you'll spend
it on drink--


188
0:6:35,14 --> 0:6:35,98
on drugs, too.


189
0:6:35,98 --> 0:6:36,87
Drugs is very bad--


190
0:6:36,87 --> 0:6:37,195
EDDY MORETTI: Really?


191
0:6:37,195 --> 0:6:37,52
MALE SPEAKER 2: --out there.


192
0:6:37,52 --> 0:6:40,79
Oh yeah, you'll see a lot
downtown, I have a daughter


193
0:6:40,79 --> 0:6:43,0
that's 3 1/2 years old--


194
0:6:43,0 --> 0:6:45,92
4 and 1/2 years old, and I was
just talking to her, anyway.


195
0:6:45,92 --> 0:6:46,5
It's hard.


196
0:6:46,5 --> 0:6:48,935
It's hard on the family, but--


197
0:6:48,935 --> 0:6:51,46
My wife's a teacher, a French
teacher, and she understands.


198
0:6:51,46 --> 0:6:52,76
I'm up there for both of us.


199
0:6:52,76 --> 0:6:54,9
And I'm not out wasting money.


200
0:6:54,9 --> 0:6:56,11
I'm putting it away and trying
to pay off the bills.


201
0:6:56,11 --> 0:6:58,22
When you're making three times
what you're making at home--


202
0:6:58,22 --> 0:6:59,6
EDDY MORETTI: Right.


203
0:6:59,6 --> 0:7:0,74
MALE SPEAKER 2: It's
family life.


204
0:7:0,74 --> 0:7:2,18
EDDY MORETTI: How long
you been here?


205
0:7:2,18 --> 0:7:3,4
MALE SPEAKER 2: Last year
I was here about nine


206
0:7:3,4 --> 0:7:4,51
months in the camp.


207
0:7:4,51 --> 0:7:5,76
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


208
0:7:5,76 --> 0:7:7,947



209
0:7:7,947 --> 0:7:10,79
We're going to get a chance to
see what one of these places


210
0:7:10,79 --> 0:7:13,538
looks like.


211
0:7:13,538 --> 0:7:15,28
Could we take a look?


212
0:7:15,28 --> 0:7:15,76
MALE SPEAKER 3: Sure.


213
0:7:15,76 --> 0:7:17,2
Go ahead.


214
0:7:17,2 --> 0:7:17,89
It's how we live.


215
0:7:17,89 --> 0:7:19,63
It's pretty hard to beat it,
when you're living--


216
0:7:19,63 --> 0:7:21,366
Your food is good.


217
0:7:21,366 --> 0:7:24,53
I've been back and forth
for 10, 11 years, now.


218
0:7:24,53 --> 0:7:28,12
EDDY MORETTI: How does this
compare to back then?


219
0:7:28,12 --> 0:7:30,22
MALE SPEAKER 3: Better, the food
gets better, you know,


220
0:7:30,22 --> 0:7:31,625
and more people.


221
0:7:31,625 --> 0:7:34,58
But you know, my days are
getting numbered, now, so--


222
0:7:34,58 --> 0:7:35,475
EDDY MORETTI: Why is that?


223
0:7:35,475 --> 0:7:36,68
MALE SPEAKER 3: Gotta
retire, boy.


224
0:7:36,68 --> 0:7:38,79
EDDY MORETTI: Oh, good,
that's great.


225
0:7:38,79 --> 0:7:39,52
And what are you going to do?


226
0:7:39,52 --> 0:7:40,96
What's your retirement plan?


227
0:7:40,96 --> 0:7:43,45
MALE SPEAKER 3: Going to grow
marijuana down in Englishtown.


228
0:7:43,45 --> 0:7:45,311
[LAUGHTER]


229
0:7:45,311 --> 0:7:46,11
EDDY MORETTI: That's
my brother.


230
0:7:46,11 --> 0:7:47,94
MALE SPEAKER 3: No, but
I'm gonna reti--


231
0:7:47,94 --> 0:7:50,79
just relax.


232
0:7:50,79 --> 0:7:52,98
EDDY MORETTI: We started
researching this story about


233
0:7:52,98 --> 0:7:56,49
the economic boom in Alberta,
because of the oil industry.


234
0:7:56,49 --> 0:7:58,67
And primarily we were, you
know, interested in the


235
0:7:58,67 --> 0:8:1,95
environmental side of the whole
issue, but then when we


236
0:8:1,95 --> 0:8:3,97
started looking and researching,
it started


237
0:8:3,97 --> 0:8:7,19
opening little, like, layers
of the onion started


238
0:8:7,19 --> 0:8:8,63
unravelling.


239
0:8:8,63 --> 0:8:9,88
Gangs.


240
0:8:9,88 --> 0:8:13,446



241
0:8:13,446 --> 0:8:15,81
Whoa.


242
0:8:15,81 --> 0:8:17,33
He's got some shit
for us, already.


243
0:8:17,33 --> 0:8:20,725



244
0:8:20,725 --> 0:8:24,12
This is interesting, here.


245
0:8:24,12 --> 0:8:25,58
What does this mean?


246
0:8:25,58 --> 0:8:26,88
Is this some kind of,
like, martial arts--


247
0:8:26,88 --> 0:8:27,603
MALE SPEAKER 4: That's
just, you know--


248
0:8:27,603 --> 0:8:28,29
EDDY MORETTI: --thing, and--


249
0:8:28,29 --> 0:8:30,39
MALE SPEAKER 4: Yeah,
I don't know why.


250
0:8:30,39 --> 0:8:33,21
Where that came from, I can't
tell you, for sure--


251
0:8:33,21 --> 0:8:36,309
likely out of a search
warrant, or


252
0:8:36,309 --> 0:8:38,909
a search of a vehicle.


253
0:8:38,909 --> 0:8:42,0
EDDY MORETTI: Have you ever,
sort of, seen the victim of


254
0:8:42,0 --> 0:8:43,559
some of these, like--


255
0:8:43,559 --> 0:8:45,0
this looks pretty brutal.


256
0:8:45,0 --> 0:8:45,69
MALE SPEAKER 4: Yeah.


257
0:8:45,69 --> 0:8:46,15
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah?


258
0:8:46,15 --> 0:8:46,636
MALE SPEAKER 4: Oh, yeah.


259
0:8:46,636 --> 0:8:48,58
Yeah.


260
0:8:48,58 --> 0:8:51,12
EDDY MORETTI: So It's kind
of bloody, out there.


261
0:8:51,12 --> 0:8:55,93
We have quite a few criminal
networks, otherwise known as


262
0:8:55,93 --> 0:8:56,98
street gangs--


263
0:8:56,98 --> 0:9:0,29
a bunch of kids who've
gotten together.


264
0:9:0,29 --> 0:9:2,11
EDDY MORETTI: Any
Italian gangs?


265
0:9:2,11 --> 0:9:3,22
MALE SPEAKER 4: Ah, not
that I know of.


266
0:9:3,22 --> 0:9:4,64
EDDY MORETTI: No goombas,
or anything like that--


267
0:9:4,64 --> 0:9:5,3
MALE SPEAKER 4: --Italian
gang--


268
0:9:5,3 --> 0:9:8,45
EDDY MORETTI: No il Fratelli,
il giavanotti,


269
0:9:8,45 --> 0:9:10,66
none of those guys?


270
0:9:10,66 --> 0:9:12,75
How much money is on
the table, here?


271
0:9:12,75 --> 0:9:13,8
MALE SPEAKER 4: If you look
right here, there is


272
0:9:13,8 --> 0:9:19,69
approximately, say-- there's
approximately $2,500 to $3,000


273
0:9:19,69 --> 0:9:21,15
in cocaine, here.


274
0:9:21,15 --> 0:9:25,69
EDDY MORETTI: I heard that the
drug trade that's tied into


275
0:9:25,69 --> 0:9:29,39
the, you know, boom, is worth
about a million a month.


276
0:9:29,39 --> 0:9:32,11
MALE SPEAKER 4: A million
dollars a month, street level,


277
0:9:32,11 --> 0:9:33,38
that would be low.


278
0:9:33,38 --> 0:9:34,72
EDDY MORETTI: Low?


279
0:9:34,72 --> 0:9:38,51
How much is going in one nostril
and into their brain?


280
0:9:38,51 --> 0:9:38,84
MALE SPEAKER 4: This is


281
0:9:38,84 --> 0:9:40,71
methamphetamines, or crystal meth.


282
0:9:40,71 --> 0:9:42,5
This you don't want
to swallow.


283
0:9:42,5 --> 0:9:44,96
EDDY MORETTI: That you don't
want anywhere near any part of


284
0:9:44,96 --> 0:9:46,2
your body whatsoever.


285
0:9:46,2 --> 0:9:46,81
MALE SPEAKER 4: That's
correct.


286
0:9:46,81 --> 0:9:48,34
EDDY MORETTI: Interesting.


287
0:9:48,34 --> 0:9:50,12
Is that good?


288
0:9:50,12 --> 0:9:51,37
I think we're good.


289
0:9:51,37 --> 0:9:55,1



290
0:9:55,1 --> 0:9:56,87
So this is it, you know.


291
0:9:56,87 --> 0:9:58,33
This is what it's come to.


292
0:9:58,33 --> 0:10:2,91
We're scraping the bottom of the
planetary barrel for the


293
0:10:2,91 --> 0:10:7,39
worst kind of oil, which means
this is what we've come to--


294
0:10:7,39 --> 0:10:12,106
subzero trailer parks in the
middle of fucking Canadian


295
0:10:12,106 --> 0:10:17,95
arctic in order to supply
our thirst for fuel.


296
0:10:17,95 --> 0:10:18,51
That's it.


297
0:10:18,51 --> 0:10:20,5
Mark your fucking territory.


298
0:10:20,5 --> 0:10:21,25
I have--


299
0:10:21,25 --> 0:10:24,58
there's not enough housing up
here, so people end up buying


300
0:10:24,58 --> 0:10:25,75
or renting trailers.


301
0:10:25,75 --> 0:10:29,145
They're even renting plots
of land, over here.


302
0:10:29,145 --> 0:10:35,52
They have about 300 spots
in this trailer park.


303
0:10:35,52 --> 0:10:39,862
The average rent is, like,
$1,200 a month to live in the


304
0:10:39,862 --> 0:10:41,112
middle of nowhere.


305
0:10:41,112 --> 0:10:44,536



306
0:10:44,536 --> 0:10:48,48
I would go fucking ape-shit
out here.


307
0:10:48,48 --> 0:10:52,45
I wish someone would come out
and, like, welcome us.


308
0:10:52,45 --> 0:10:55,35
MALE SPEAKER 5: Well,
I started in June.


309
0:10:55,35 --> 0:10:57,37
I was living in an apartment
back home.


310
0:10:57,37 --> 0:10:58,94
I couldn't get nowhere.


311
0:10:58,94 --> 0:11:0,58
I had no way to jump-start
my life.


312
0:11:0,58 --> 0:11:4,98
I have a family and kids I
couldn't support, so--


313
0:11:4,98 --> 0:11:6,76
EDDY MORETTI: You do what
you have to do.


314
0:11:6,76 --> 0:11:8,28
MALE SPEAKER 5: Hey, I hate--


315
0:11:8,28 --> 0:11:10,9
look at the stacks, what they're
throwing into the air.


316
0:11:10,9 --> 0:11:10,44
Sometimes--


317
0:11:10,44 --> 0:11:10,9
EDDY MORETTI: It's terrible.


318
0:11:10,9 --> 0:11:13,7
MALE SPEAKER 5: --you wake up
here in the daytime, and it


319
0:11:13,7 --> 0:11:15,21
smells like crude in the
air in the summertime.


320
0:11:15,21 --> 0:11:18,92
But if they say to you, "hey, I
know you hate what all these


321
0:11:18,92 --> 0:11:22,84
plants are doing up here, but
hey, I could give you enough


322
0:11:22,84 --> 0:11:24,27
money to support your family.


323
0:11:24,27 --> 0:11:26,97
I can give you enough money to
live happily in your own


324
0:11:26,97 --> 0:11:28,53
house."


325
0:11:28,53 --> 0:11:31,38
Every man has his price, and
basically, I see it as, they


326
0:11:31,38 --> 0:11:34,7
pay us just enough to keep our
mouth shut, to come here, to


327
0:11:34,7 --> 0:11:35,865
do our work and go home.


328
0:11:35,865 --> 0:11:38,48
Would I rather raise my family
here or back home?


329
0:11:38,48 --> 0:11:40,47
See, if I raise them here,
I'm probably going to


330
0:11:40,47 --> 0:11:40,98
be living in this.


331
0:11:40,98 --> 0:11:41,17
EDDY MORETTI: Right.


332
0:11:41,17 --> 0:11:43,78
MALE SPEAKER 5: Back home,
I had a nice--


333
0:11:43,78 --> 0:11:44,97
EDDY MORETTI: Nice apartment,
nice place.


334
0:11:44,97 --> 0:11:46,26
MALE SPEAKER 5: Everybody came
over all the time, now I don't


335
0:11:46,26 --> 0:11:46,7
see no one.


336
0:11:46,7 --> 0:11:48,63
I don't go out.


337
0:11:48,63 --> 0:11:50,57
EDDY MORETTI: Are
you depressed?


338
0:11:50,57 --> 0:11:50,94
MALE SPEAKER 5: No.


339
0:11:50,94 --> 0:11:52,58
Sometimes it does get to you.


340
0:11:52,58 --> 0:11:52,95
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


341
0:11:52,95 --> 0:11:55,35
MALE SPEAKER 5: It really
gets to you, but--


342
0:11:55,35 --> 0:11:56,91
EDDY MORETTI: Do you have
a girlfriend here?


343
0:11:56,91 --> 0:11:58,5
MALE SPEAKER 5: Nope, one was
supposed to come out with me,


344
0:11:58,5 --> 0:12:1,11
and uh, she took off.


345
0:12:1,11 --> 0:12:3,65
EDDY MORETTI: This doesn't seem
like a healthy place.


346
0:12:3,65 --> 0:12:5,1
MALE SPEAKER 5: This isn't
a town I want to live in.


347
0:12:5,1 --> 0:12:5,47
EDDY MORETTI: Right.


348
0:12:5,47 --> 0:12:7,31
There's no future.


349
0:12:7,31 --> 0:12:9,57
MALE SPEAKER 5: There's
future in this town.


350
0:12:9,57 --> 0:12:10,96
There's a helluva lot
of money to be made.


351
0:12:10,96 --> 0:12:12,325
EDDY MORETTI: There's
not a future for a


352
0:12:12,325 --> 0:12:13,43
guy like you, though?


353
0:12:13,43 --> 0:12:14,86
MALE SPEAKER 5: Well, do you
want money, or do you want


354
0:12:14,86 --> 0:12:17,37
live a happy life in, like, a
nice little land, somewhere,


355
0:12:17,37 --> 0:12:19,67
with your wife and your
couple of kids.


356
0:12:19,67 --> 0:12:20,24
EDDY MORETTI: What are
you going to take


357
0:12:20,24 --> 0:12:22,6
away from this place?


358
0:12:22,6 --> 0:12:23,41
MALE SPEAKER 5: Uh, take
away from this place--


359
0:12:23,41 --> 0:12:25,61
I'm up here to make
my own money.


360
0:12:25,61 --> 0:12:28,52
I'm not up here to
screw anyone.


361
0:12:28,52 --> 0:12:31,99
I'm not bringing much to this
community, although I like to


362
0:12:31,99 --> 0:12:34,785
provide them a service.


363
0:12:34,785 --> 0:12:40,65
But this community doesn't
really do much for you.


364
0:12:40,65 --> 0:12:42,48
I'm not here to be
nice to anyone.


365
0:12:42,48 --> 0:12:44,98
I'm not going to screw anyone,
but at the end of the day,


366
0:12:44,98 --> 0:12:46,82
it's for me.


367
0:12:46,82 --> 0:12:51,47
But I'm not coming up here
just to rape the land and


368
0:12:51,47 --> 0:12:52,53
everything else like that.


369
0:12:52,53 --> 0:12:56,7
I'm up here to make a go at my
life and to live on my own.


370
0:12:56,7 --> 0:12:59,24



371
0:12:59,24 --> 0:13:0,4
PAULA OYONOSKI: Well the
publication is almost like


372
0:13:0,4 --> 0:13:4,16
putting a human face on the oil
sands, who is extracting


373
0:13:4,16 --> 0:13:6,98
the energy, where do they come
from, why are they doing it


374
0:13:6,98 --> 0:13:9,59
You know, people come here and
get a really quick glimpse.


375
0:13:9,59 --> 0:13:12,62
You know, and we've had a lot
of outside media, they get


376
0:13:12,62 --> 0:13:16,22
their thoughts and views from
bars, and it's such a small


377
0:13:16,22 --> 0:13:17,37
snippet of this community.


378
0:13:17,37 --> 0:13:19,21
And I think that's frustrating
for a lot of people.


379
0:13:19,21 --> 0:13:19,76
EDDY MORETTI: Right.


380
0:13:19,76 --> 0:13:21,0
PAULA OYONOSKI: You know that's
one of the things


381
0:13:21,0 --> 0:13:22,64
outside media has, sort of,
pointed at us for--


382
0:13:22,64 --> 0:13:23,46
make money.


383
0:13:23,46 --> 0:13:27,13
But it's one of those things
that-- it's almost too bad,


384
0:13:27,13 --> 0:13:30,16
because people come here not
planning ahead, expecting that


385
0:13:30,16 --> 0:13:32,78
they can come here and get
a place to live and get a


386
0:13:32,78 --> 0:13:35,3
$100,000 job, "like that."


387
0:13:35,3 --> 0:13:37,37
And the fact of the matter is
you have to look ahead and


388
0:13:37,37 --> 0:13:39,43
find accommodations, because
it's hard to find


389
0:13:39,43 --> 0:13:40,29
accommodations, here.


390
0:13:40,29 --> 0:13:43,56
And I think that's where a lot
of people run into problems.


391
0:13:43,56 --> 0:13:45,96
BRYAN LUTES: Well, we are a
not-for-profit corporation--


392
0:13:45,96 --> 0:13:46,48
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


393
0:13:46,48 --> 0:13:47,995
BRYAN LUTES: --that's set
up to do housing--


394
0:13:47,995 --> 0:13:48,827
EDDY MORETTI: Right.


395
0:13:48,827 --> 0:13:50,26
BRYAN LUTES: --throughout
the community.


396
0:13:50,26 --> 0:13:53,34
A one bedroom apartment here is
$1,500 to $1,800 a month if


397
0:13:53,34 --> 0:13:54,154
you can find one.


398
0:13:54,154 --> 0:13:56,85
Average 3-bedroom bungalow
is $480,000.


399
0:13:56,85 --> 0:13:58,3
EDDY MORETTI: That's
ridiculous.


400
0:13:58,3 --> 0:14:0,37
That's-- you can get a nice
apartment in Manhattan.


401
0:14:0,37 --> 0:14:1,22
BRYAN LUTES: You can't
find a trailer,


402
0:14:1,22 --> 0:14:3,46
here, for under $300,000.


403
0:14:3,46 --> 0:14:5,74
EDDY MORETTI: So it's kind
of out of control.


404
0:14:5,74 --> 0:14:9,4
BRYAN LUTES: Well, median income
here is $93,000 a year.


405
0:14:9,4 --> 0:14:12,6
Anybody under $70,000 a year
needs some sort of assistance


406
0:14:12,6 --> 0:14:13,6
with housing.


407
0:14:13,6 --> 0:14:14,99
EDDY MORETTI: So if I took
my salary from New


408
0:14:14,99 --> 0:14:17,21
York, I would be under--


409
0:14:17,21 --> 0:14:17,4
BRYAN LUTES: You would--


410
0:14:17,4 --> 0:14:17,97
EDDY MORETTI: I would
need assistance--


411
0:14:17,97 --> 0:14:19,38
BRYAN LUTES: You would need
some assistance, here.


412
0:14:19,38 --> 0:14:21,94
EDDY MORETTI: Cool.


413
0:14:21,94 --> 0:14:21,532
Hello.


414
0:14:21,532 --> 0:14:22,41
MIKE #2: Hi.


415
0:14:22,41 --> 0:14:23,746
EDDY MORETTI: Hey, I'm Eddy.


416
0:14:23,746 --> 0:14:24,7
MIKE #2: What's up, man.


417
0:14:24,7 --> 0:14:25,53
EDDY MORETTI: What's
your name.


418
0:14:25,53 --> 0:14:25,91
MIKE #2: Mike.


419
0:14:25,91 --> 0:14:27,5
EDDY MORETTI: Mike, what's up?


420
0:14:27,5 --> 0:14:27,96
ANTHONY: Hey, I'm Anthony.


421
0:14:27,96 --> 0:14:28,96
EDDY MORETTI: How you
doing, buddy?


422
0:14:28,96 --> 0:14:29,53
ANTHONY: Good, how are you?


423
0:14:29,53 --> 0:14:30,7
EDDY MORETTI: What's up?


424
0:14:30,7 --> 0:14:32,43
ANTHONY: My best friend in the
whole world said, "oh, come on


425
0:14:32,43 --> 0:14:34,16
up for the oil, already,
right."


426
0:14:34,16 --> 0:14:35,37
EDDY MORETTI: And what--


427
0:14:35,37 --> 0:14:37,98
ANTHONY: "--in the oil field,
you could make this and that


428
0:14:37,98 --> 0:14:40,89
up on site, and blah blah
blah." So it was the


429
0:14:40,89 --> 0:14:43,1
big hype, and then--


430
0:14:43,1 --> 0:14:43,94
here I am, now.


431
0:14:43,94 --> 0:14:46,53
Here I am, here, I struggled.


432
0:14:46,53 --> 0:14:48,33
I went to the Salvation
Army, and that


433
0:14:48,33 --> 0:14:49,68
was quite the struggle.


434
0:14:49,68 --> 0:14:53,2
At 7:30, they kick you out every
morning, regardless.


435
0:14:53,2 --> 0:14:53,22
EDDY MORETTI: Really?


436
0:14:53,22 --> 0:14:57,48
ANTHONY: Minus 40, minus 50,
regardless, every day.


437
0:14:57,48 --> 0:14:57,775
EDDY MORETTI: Why?


438
0:14:57,775 --> 0:14:59,28
ANTHONY: Seven days a week.


439
0:14:59,28 --> 0:15:1,21
They just want you out.


440
0:15:1,21 --> 0:15:5,16
So you had-- and then this place
opened up, and it's a


441
0:15:5,16 --> 0:15:7,44
real blessing, this place--
the Marshall House.


442
0:15:7,44 --> 0:15:8,24
EDDY MORETTI: Right.


443
0:15:8,24 --> 0:15:11,76
ANTHONY: It all gathers into
one thing, this town--


444
0:15:11,76 --> 0:15:13,21
EDDY MORETTI: Oil.


445
0:15:13,21 --> 0:15:14,582
ANTHONY: It's money.


446
0:15:14,582 --> 0:15:15,295
It's money.


447
0:15:15,295 --> 0:15:16,5
It's money.


448
0:15:16,5 --> 0:15:18,7
It's a very greedy town,
to be honest with you.


449
0:15:18,7 --> 0:15:19,51
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


450
0:15:19,51 --> 0:15:21,54
ANTHONY: Walking down the road
all the time, I used to be,


451
0:15:21,54 --> 0:15:22,89
like, why can't I have that.


452
0:15:22,89 --> 0:15:22,983
EDDY


453
0:15:22,983 --> 0:15:23,51
MORETTI: Right [LAUGHTER]


454
0:15:23,51 --> 0:15:25,34
ANTHONY: Why can't I
have that vehicle?


455
0:15:25,34 --> 0:15:26,75
EDDY MORETTI: Slowly, you can.


456
0:15:26,75 --> 0:15:27,22
ANTHONY: Why can't
I have a house?


457
0:15:27,22 --> 0:15:28,91
You know what I mean, though,
like it's kind of degrading.


458
0:15:28,91 --> 0:15:30,9
It's, like, shit.


459
0:15:30,9 --> 0:15:32,98
You know, you're sitting there
kicking cans, walking down the


460
0:15:32,98 --> 0:15:34,53
road, homeless.


461
0:15:34,53 --> 0:15:36,96
And here's Joe Blow
driving by in an


462
0:15:36,96 --> 0:15:40,43
$80,000 or $70,000 truck.


463
0:15:40,43 --> 0:15:42,84
I really want to just
get up on site.


464
0:15:42,84 --> 0:15:43,555
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


465
0:15:43,555 --> 0:15:45,6
ANTHONY: You know, that's
my ultimate goal.


466
0:15:45,6 --> 0:15:47,77
It's just to start making a bit
of money and have a life


467
0:15:47,77 --> 0:15:50,1
I've never had, you know.


468
0:15:50,1 --> 0:15:53,15
BRYAN LUTES: We're projecting
8%, 9% growth a year for the


469
0:15:53,15 --> 0:15:55,4
next three to five years.


470
0:15:55,4 --> 0:15:55,4
EDDY MORETTI: Right.


471
0:15:55,4 --> 0:15:57,64
BRYAN LUTES: Without going
past that date, which is


472
0:15:57,64 --> 0:15:58,45
phenomenal.


473
0:15:58,45 --> 0:15:59,66
EDDY MORETTI: Which
is too much--


474
0:15:59,66 --> 0:16:1,14
BRYAN LUTES: I mean, most
large cities, if they're


475
0:16:1,14 --> 0:16:2,32
growing 2% or 3%--


476
0:16:2,32 --> 0:16:2,625
EDDY MORETTI: 2% or 3%.


477
0:16:2,625 --> 0:16:4,44
BRYAN LUTES: --think It's
barely sustainable.


478
0:16:4,44 --> 0:16:6,7
We're at 9%.


479
0:16:6,7 --> 0:16:8,78
EDDY MORETTI: Given, like, the
real estate market, here, if


480
0:16:8,78 --> 0:16:11,3
you wanted to, you could charge
a lot of money for


481
0:16:11,3 --> 0:16:14,13
these units, and you could
be a very rich man.


482
0:16:14,13 --> 0:16:15,68
BRYAN LUTES: I've been in the
development and property


483
0:16:15,68 --> 0:16:19,15
management business for many
years, and the opportunity


484
0:16:19,15 --> 0:16:24,77
came up to do what I love doing
for a really good cause.


485
0:16:24,77 --> 0:16:28,28
And one case in particular was
a lady that was in a tent on


486
0:16:28,28 --> 0:16:31,59
the river, came in, got
her stuff together,


487
0:16:31,59 --> 0:16:33,5
got her life together--


488
0:16:33,5 --> 0:16:34,53
EDDY MORETTI: Tent on the
river in the winter?


489
0:16:34,53 --> 0:16:35,38
BRYAN LUTES: In the
winter, oh yeah.


490
0:16:35,38 --> 0:16:36,13
It's not uncommon.


491
0:16:36,13 --> 0:16:36,92
We can take you down--


492
0:16:36,92 --> 0:16:37,695
EDDY MORETTI: Can you
take us down?


493
0:16:37,695 --> 0:16:39,15
BRYAN LUTES: We can go
down to the river and


494
0:16:39,15 --> 0:16:40,15
see this right now.


495
0:16:40,15 --> 0:18:40,15
