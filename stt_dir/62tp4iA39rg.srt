1
0:0:39,101 --> 0:0:42,805
No one tells me what I can do.


2
0:0:42,805 --> 0:0:44,173
Especially you.


3
0:0:44,173 --> 0:0:49,345
-I traveled all this way to--
-I can have anything I want...


4
0:0:49,345 --> 0:0:51,68
and I want that diamond...


5
0:0:51,68 --> 0:0:55,818
the greatest diamond in all the universe.


6
0:0:55,818 --> 0:0:59,622
Let me try to explain this
just once more, Your Highness.


7
0:0:59,622 --> 0:1:2,191
If anything happens to that diamond--


8
0:1:2,191 --> 0:1:9,498
I don't want to talk to you anymore.


9
0:1:9,498 --> 0:1:13,469
You are going to destroy everybody
in the whole universe.


10
0:1:13,469 --> 0:1:17,84
-Take him away!
-You will destroy yourself.


11
0:1:17,84 --> 0:1:23,846
You dare attack my power?


12
0:1:23,846 --> 0:1:27,516
You can stop me, but there are others.


13
0:1:27,516 --> 0:1:30,119
If only....


14
0:1:30,119 --> 0:1:40,696
Where is my horse?
At least let me say goodbye to my horse.


15
0:1:40,696 --> 0:2:50,299
No one is going to stop me.


16
0:2:50,299 --> 0:2:52,668
It's spring!


17
0:2:52,668 --> 0:3:7,549
Spring! It's in the air.


18
0:3:7,549 --> 0:3:10,919
<i>Wake up, flowers</i>


19
0:3:10,919 --> 0:3:14,356
<i>I've been up for hours</i>


20
0:3:14,356 --> 0:3:18,227
<i>There's work to do</i>


21
0:3:18,227 --> 0:3:21,83
<i>Birds, start flyin'</i>


22
0:3:21,83 --> 0:3:25,234
<i>No more me-oh-myin'</i>


23
0:3:25,234 --> 0:3:28,971
<i>There's work to do</i>


24
0:3:28,971 --> 0:3:32,508
<i>Everybody's got a part to play</i>


25
0:3:32,508 --> 0:3:36,311
<i>To start each day in a beautiful way</i>


26
0:3:36,311 --> 0:3:39,248
<i>Every mornin' when the night goes away</i>


27
0:3:39,248 --> 0:3:57,99
<i>Every mornin' is a brand-new day</i>


28
0:3:57,99 --> 0:4:3,205
What do you take me for,
the morning bus?


29
0:4:3,205 --> 0:4:6,642
<i>Even little things</i>


30
0:4:6,642 --> 0:4:9,745
<i>Need a helping wing</i>


31
0:4:9,745 --> 0:4:24,593
<i>There's work to do</i>


32
0:4:24,593 --> 0:4:28,297
<i>Sun, start glowin'</i>


33
0:4:28,297 --> 0:4:31,366
<i>Pack away your snow things</i>


34
0:4:31,366 --> 0:4:35,304
<i>There's work to do</i>


35
0:4:35,304 --> 0:4:38,507
<i>Up and at 'em</i>


36
0:4:38,507 --> 0:4:41,977
<i>You can't just hang around when</i>


37
0:4:41,977 --> 0:4:49,885
<i>There's work to do</i>


38
0:4:49,885 --> 0:4:52,921
<i>Everybody's got a part to play</i>


39
0:4:52,921 --> 0:4:56,792
<i>To start each day in a beautiful way</i>


40
0:4:56,792 --> 0:5:1,864
<i>Every mornin' when the night goes away</i>


41
0:5:1,864 --> 0:5:3,699
Good morning, Starlite.


42
0:5:3,699 --> 0:5:5,434
Good morning to you all.


43
0:5:5,434 --> 0:5:28,957
<i>Every mornin' is a brand-new day</i>


44
0:5:28,957 --> 0:5:53,348
That's my job.


45
0:5:53,348 --> 0:5:54,883
Good morning.


46
0:5:54,883 --> 0:5:56,752
<i>Mornin'</i>


47
0:5:56,752 --> 0:6:2,157
<i>Rainbow Brite</i>


48
0:6:2,157 --> 0:6:7,95
<i>Feel the sunlight</i>


49
0:6:7,95 --> 0:6:9,431
<i>There's work to do</i>


50
0:6:9,431 --> 0:6:12,701
Good morning, everyone.


51
0:6:12,701 --> 0:6:16,839
It's spring, Rainbow.


52
0:6:16,839 --> 0:6:31,62
I know, Twink. Thank you.
Twink, the star sprinkles.


53
0:6:31,62 --> 0:6:35,123
Okay, let's get to work.


54
0:6:35,123 --> 0:6:38,16
<i>Everybody's got a part to play</i>


55
0:6:38,16 --> 0:6:42,297
<i>To start each day in a beautiful way</i>


56
0:6:42,297 --> 0:6:45,133
<i>Every mornin' when the night goes away</i>


57
0:6:45,133 --> 0:6:51,273
<i>Every mornin' is a rainbow day</i>


58
0:6:51,273 --> 0:6:54,509
<i>Every mornin' is a brand-new day</i>


59
0:6:54,509 --> 0:7:2,84
<i>And you've got a part to play</i>


60
0:7:2,84 --> 0:7:6,488
Come on, Starlite.
Everyone on Earth is waiting for spring.


61
0:7:6,488 --> 0:7:43,959
We've got work to do.


62
0:7:43,959 --> 0:7:47,429
Oh, boy.


63
0:7:47,429 --> 0:7:51,4
Murky, hurry. It's almost spring.


64
0:7:51,4 --> 0:7:58,473
It's never going to be spring.


65
0:7:58,473 --> 0:8:1,41
One blast from my Super Gloom Boomer...


66
0:8:1,41 --> 0:8:5,881
and Rainbow Brite
will never make anything beautiful again.


67
0:8:5,881 --> 0:8:10,786
Oh, boy. Then do I get to
ride on her horsy?


68
0:8:10,786 --> 0:8:14,423
Murky, that smells terrible.


69
0:8:14,423 --> 0:8:18,26
Now, at last,
I'll be the ruler of Rainbow Land.


70
0:8:18,26 --> 0:8:26,1
No more colors.
Nothing but gloom everywhere.


71
0:8:26,1 --> 0:8:28,904
Get it, banana-brain!


72
0:8:28,904 --> 0:8:31,807
No.


73
0:8:31,807 --> 0:8:35,277
Get after it.


74
0:8:35,277 --> 0:8:43,151
Okay, Murky.


75
0:8:43,151 --> 0:8:52,861
I'm getting it, Murky.


76
0:8:52,861 --> 0:8:58,8
Don't worry, Murky. I'll get it.


77
0:8:58,8 --> 0:9:7,42
Come back here.


78
0:9:7,42 --> 0:9:14,249
No!


79
0:9:14,249 --> 0:9:22,257
Faster, snail-brain.


80
0:9:22,257 --> 0:9:36,138
Lurky!


81
0:9:36,138 --> 0:9:39,674
I wish we didn't have to go through this
every spring.


82
0:9:39,674 --> 0:9:42,778
The Earth needs the winter rain, Twink.
You know that.


83
0:9:42,778 --> 0:9:45,614
Everyone knows that.


84
0:9:45,614 --> 0:9:52,687
But I think they've had enough winter
for this year.


85
0:9:52,687 --> 0:9:57,859
-Winter isn't over yet.
-Stormy, it's time for spring.


86
0:9:57,859 --> 0:10:9,204
I'm having too much fun.


87
0:10:9,204 --> 0:10:19,648
Skydancer.


88
0:10:19,648 --> 0:10:24,653
It's time for spring, Stormy.


89
0:10:24,653 --> 0:10:27,422
Stormy, things have to happen
when it's time.


90
0:10:27,422 --> 0:10:38,9
It's wintertime!


91
0:10:38,9 --> 0:10:51,88
-Come on, Starlite. Let's catch them.
-My pleasure.


92
0:10:51,88 --> 0:10:54,82
You'll never catch us.


93
0:10:54,82 --> 0:11:2,224
There isn't a horse in the universe
who can outrun the magnificent Starlite.


94
0:11:2,224 --> 0:11:3,658
Come on, Skydancer.


95
0:11:3,658 --> 0:11:12,1
If they catch us,
winter's over for another year.


96
0:11:12,1 --> 0:11:25,914
Now it will be winter all year round.


97
0:11:25,914 --> 0:11:29,784
Come on, Skydancer.


98
0:11:29,784 --> 0:11:51,94
-See you in Rainbow Land.
-See you.


99
0:11:51,94 --> 0:11:59,47
No more fun for three whole seasons.


100
0:11:59,47 --> 0:12:14,93
Long winter this year.


101
0:12:14,93 --> 0:12:22,771
Hi, what's up?


102
0:12:22,771 --> 0:12:24,5
Rainbow.


103
0:12:24,5 --> 0:12:25,807
I could never let anything happen...


104
0:12:25,807 --> 0:12:28,109
to the only person on Earth
who can see me.


105
0:12:28,109 --> 0:12:31,646
Boy, it's about time you got here.
Look at all this snow.


106
0:12:31,646 --> 0:12:48,23
Stormy got a little carried away
this year. Twink?


107
0:12:48,23 --> 0:12:51,132
The rainbow didn't do anything.


108
0:12:51,132 --> 0:12:54,436
Maybe the star sprinkles
are tired from the winter.


109
0:12:54,436 --> 0:12:58,106
They never got tired before.
There's something wrong.


110
0:12:58,106 --> 0:13:2,544
If spring doesn't get started soon,
flowers will die.


111
0:13:2,544 --> 0:13:4,579
The birds won't lay their eggs.


112
0:13:4,579 --> 0:13:7,916
And I don't want to think
about the baseball season.


113
0:13:7,916 --> 0:13:11,953
Spring's when life comes back,
when hope starts to grow again.


114
0:13:11,953 --> 0:13:15,59
All sorts of terrible things will happen
if there isn't any spring.


115
0:13:15,59 --> 0:13:18,526
We'd better get back to Rainbow Land
and see what happened.


116
0:13:18,526 --> 0:13:21,563
And fast.


117
0:13:21,563 --> 0:13:23,965
Spring will be here
before you know it, Brian.


118
0:13:23,965 --> 0:13:26,635
-Come on, Starlite.
-To Rainbow Land.


119
0:13:26,635 --> 0:13:29,671
I know where we have to go.
Thank you very much.


120
0:13:29,671 --> 0:13:39,748
Goodbye, Rainbow.


121
0:13:39,748 --> 0:13:42,517
There's no place like home.


122
0:13:42,517 --> 0:13:50,425
Every place will be like home
as soon as I get this machine fixed.


123
0:13:50,425 --> 0:13:56,931
-No.
-Murky, you're dancing.


124
0:13:56,931 --> 0:13:59,534
Help me!


125
0:13:59,534 --> 0:14:2,637
I love dancing.


126
0:14:2,637 --> 0:14:12,13
Goody.


127
0:14:12,13 --> 0:14:16,584
-I'm coming, Murky.
-No!


128
0:14:16,584 --> 0:14:21,256
Get off me.


129
0:14:21,256 --> 0:14:23,591
Murky, look.


130
0:14:23,591 --> 0:14:26,961
It's a shooting star.


131
0:14:26,961 --> 0:14:33,201
Haven't you ever seen
a shooting star before?


132
0:14:33,201 --> 0:14:36,204
Never this close before.


133
0:14:36,204 --> 0:14:43,845
Lurky, come back here.


134
0:14:43,845 --> 0:14:47,982
Stay down. It may explode.


135
0:14:47,982 --> 0:14:55,457
-Go see what it is.
-Okay, Murky. I'll go see what it is.


136
0:14:55,457 --> 0:14:57,692
It's a lot of smoke, Murky.


137
0:14:57,692 --> 0:15:7,369
Come back here, dodo-brain.


138
0:15:7,369 --> 0:15:11,39
A horsy! Take me for a ride.


139
0:15:11,39 --> 0:15:14,75
Get back here.


140
0:15:14,75 --> 0:15:20,582
Goody. Boy, I get to ride a horsy.


141
0:15:20,582 --> 0:15:23,151
<i>You are Rainbow Brite?</i>


142
0:15:23,151 --> 0:15:25,92
Me? No.


143
0:15:25,92 --> 0:15:29,858
You're looking for Rainbow Brite?


144
0:15:29,858 --> 0:15:32,6
<i>Yes.</i>


145
0:15:32,6 --> 0:15:34,429
I'm Rainbow Brite.


146
0:15:34,429 --> 0:15:36,564
Murky, I never knew.


147
0:15:36,564 --> 0:15:42,27
Not now, bozo-brain.


148
0:15:42,27 --> 0:15:44,339
<i>Not Rainbow Brite.</i>


149
0:15:44,339 --> 0:15:50,44
See, Murky? Horsies are smart.
Can I have a ride now?


150
0:15:50,44 --> 0:15:53,381
<i>Not Rainbow Brite.</i>


151
0:15:53,381 --> 0:15:57,685
Just what do you want
with Rainbow Brite?


152
0:15:57,685 --> 0:16:1,723
<i>Deliver message about diamond.</i>


153
0:16:1,723 --> 0:16:4,159
Diamond?


154
0:16:4,159 --> 0:16:9,631
It's right over that hill, my friend,
in Rainbow Land.


155
0:16:9,631 --> 0:16:13,334
Murky, you're helping Rainbow Brite?


156
0:16:13,334 --> 0:16:21,676
I'm helping us, hairball.


157
0:16:21,676 --> 0:16:28,75
You tell her all about the diamond.


158
0:16:28,75 --> 0:16:34,689
Boy, I get to ride now.


159
0:16:34,689 --> 0:16:38,76
<i>Goodbye.</i>


160
0:16:38,76 --> 0:16:43,832
Hurry. We've got to get to Rainbow Land
in time to hear that horse's message.


161
0:16:43,832 --> 0:16:49,671
I'm hurrying, Murky. Boy.


162
0:16:49,671 --> 0:16:54,108
Wait, Lurky. Wait for me.


163
0:16:54,108 --> 0:17:5,82
No.


164
0:17:5,82 --> 0:17:17,298
Am I hurrying enough for you, Murky?


165
0:17:17,298 --> 0:17:19,634
A flying horse?


166
0:17:19,634 --> 0:17:30,245
-Starlite.
-Rainbow's back.


167
0:17:30,245 --> 0:17:37,552
That's not Starlite.


168
0:17:37,552 --> 0:17:44,158
-Who's he?
-Where did he come from?


169
0:17:44,158 --> 0:17:59,4
What does he want?


170
0:17:59,4 --> 0:18:1,976
<i>Danger, rain....</i>


171
0:18:1,976 --> 0:18:5,179
-Rain?
-It's not raining.


172
0:18:5,179 --> 0:18:25,867
<i>-Rainbow Brite.</i>
-Here I am.


173
0:18:25,867 --> 0:18:32,34
<i>Rain.... Danger.</i>


174
0:18:32,34 --> 0:18:40,81
<i>Brite, I am On-X. Push button.</i>


175
0:18:40,81 --> 0:18:41,649
Quick.


176
0:18:41,649 --> 0:18:44,786
This'll let us hear the message, Murky?


177
0:18:44,786 --> 0:18:50,191
If you stop talking long enough
to let me listen.


178
0:18:50,191 --> 0:18:56,598
<i>Danger.</i>


179
0:18:56,598 --> 0:18:58,666
<i>Spectra's in danger.</i>


180
0:18:58,666 --> 0:19:2,236
<i>Emergency.</i>


181
0:19:2,236 --> 0:19:6,941
-What's a Spectra?
-Spectra's the diamond planet.


182
0:19:6,941 --> 0:19:10,311
All the light in the universe
has to pass through it.


183
0:19:10,311 --> 0:19:13,881
Boy, Murky, I bet it's shiny.


184
0:19:13,881 --> 0:19:16,284
Not after I get done with it.


185
0:19:16,284 --> 0:19:20,188
This is my chance
to rid the universe of color forever.


186
0:19:20,188 --> 0:19:21,422
Let's go.


187
0:19:21,422 --> 0:19:25,994
Maybe we should hear
the rest of the message. Maybe....


188
0:19:25,994 --> 0:19:28,663
You come on, bubblehead.


189
0:19:28,663 --> 0:19:36,4
You want them to beat us
to that diamond?


190
0:19:36,4 --> 0:19:38,706
If something's happened
to that diamond....


191
0:19:38,706 --> 0:19:42,51
That explains what's happening on Earth.


192
0:19:42,51 --> 0:19:46,14
<i>The universe.... Danger.</i>


193
0:19:46,14 --> 0:19:51,786
<i>The universe will die unless you hurry.</i>


194
0:19:51,786 --> 0:19:55,857
<i>Orin says only hope is Rainbow Brite.</i>


195
0:19:55,857 --> 0:19:58,96
Orin says? And just who is Orin?


196
0:19:58,96 --> 0:20:2,363
<i>Wise one, ancient one.</i>


197
0:20:2,363 --> 0:20:4,432
The only Orin I ever heard of...


198
0:20:4,432 --> 0:20:7,502
is the one that Sprites
tells stories about at bedtime.


199
0:20:7,502 --> 0:20:11,673
But he's not real.


200
0:20:11,673 --> 0:20:13,541
Yes, he is.


201
0:20:13,541 --> 0:20:17,645
<i>Sent me to find Rainbow Brite.</i>


202
0:20:17,645 --> 0:20:21,816
<i>The universe grows darker.</i>


203
0:20:21,816 --> 0:20:25,82
I will go.


204
0:20:25,82 --> 0:20:29,19
Rainbow.


205
0:20:29,19 --> 0:20:32,293
Twink, you take care of Rainbow Land
while I'm gone.


206
0:20:32,293 --> 0:20:35,697
-Can I help, please?
-Stormy.


207
0:20:35,697 --> 0:20:45,473
I never get a chance to make things
bright and colorful.


208
0:20:45,473 --> 0:20:48,543
-Rainbow.
-Rainbow, we need you here.


209
0:20:48,543 --> 0:20:51,779
-It's spring.
-Don't you understand?


210
0:20:51,779 --> 0:20:58,653
Spring will never come again
if something happens to Spectra.


211
0:20:58,653 --> 0:21:2,356
I've never been there, but it's part of me.


212
0:21:2,356 --> 0:21:5,59
It's part of the colors and the joy we bring.


213
0:21:5,59 --> 0:21:9,3
And if Spectra dies,
happiness everywhere will die.


214
0:21:9,3 --> 0:21:18,172
Without the light of life, we'll all....
All of us will die.


215
0:21:18,172 --> 0:21:24,645
Come on, Starlite.
We haven't got a minute to lose.


216
0:21:24,645 --> 0:21:33,755
-Goodbye, Rainbow.
-Be careful.


217
0:21:33,755 --> 0:21:46,901
And hurry, Rainbow. Please. Hurry.


218
0:21:46,901 --> 0:21:51,272
Hurry up, molasses-brain,
or we'll never catch up to them.


219
0:21:51,272 --> 0:22:9,924
Yeah, I'm coming, Murky.


220
0:22:9,924 --> 0:22:19,534
Done. That diamond's going to be mine.


221
0:22:19,534 --> 0:22:22,904
Brakes, Lurky.


222
0:22:22,904 --> 0:22:25,94
Yeah. Brakes.


223
0:22:25,94 --> 0:22:31,813
Boy, I hope that wasn't the brakes.


224
0:22:31,813 --> 0:22:44,725
-Yes. Those were the brakes.
-You....


225
0:22:44,725 --> 0:22:56,27
Let's see that Rainbow brat
beat me this time.


226
0:22:56,27 --> 0:23:12,32
Next stop, Spectra.


227
0:23:12,32 --> 0:23:13,487
No.


228
0:23:13,487 --> 0:23:26,667
-Murky.
-Up. We want to go up.


229
0:23:26,667 --> 0:23:29,47
The signal isn't going through.


230
0:23:29,47 --> 0:23:57,798
-There's some kind of interference.
-We have to keep trying.


231
0:23:57,798 --> 0:24:1,702
-Starlite, look.
-What a magnificent sight.


232
0:24:1,702 --> 0:24:6,4
It really does shine
with all the light in the universe.


233
0:24:6,4 --> 0:24:8,509
But something's covering it up.


234
0:24:8,509 --> 0:24:11,946
Look. Not all the light's getting through.


235
0:24:11,946 --> 0:24:35,369
If we don't get it uncovered,
everything on Earth will die.


236
0:24:35,369 --> 0:24:43,511
You missed a spot.


237
0:24:43,511 --> 0:24:46,113
You'll scratch it.


238
0:24:46,113 --> 0:24:49,216
You have no idea how hard a job this is.


239
0:24:49,216 --> 0:24:52,153
<i>Where is Orin?</i>


240
0:24:52,153 --> 0:24:54,288
Never heard of him. My name--


241
0:24:54,288 --> 0:25:2,196
I'm Bombo. Polisher first-class. This is....


242
0:25:2,196 --> 0:25:5,132
-Oh, no.
<i>-Must find Orin.</i>


243
0:25:5,132 --> 0:25:7,935
No time to talk. Work to do.


244
0:25:7,935 --> 0:25:10,805
Stop.


245
0:25:10,805 --> 0:25:13,374
We worked all day on that spot.


246
0:25:13,374 --> 0:25:26,354
There's the problem.


247
0:25:26,354 --> 0:25:28,322
Why are they doing that?


248
0:25:28,322 --> 0:25:32,126
I don't know. Not our job.


249
0:25:32,126 --> 0:25:36,163
Just doing our job. Polish, polish, polish.


250
0:25:36,163 --> 0:25:38,265
But they're shutting out the light.


251
0:25:38,265 --> 0:25:41,202
Keep it bright and shiny.


252
0:25:41,202 --> 0:25:44,905
<i>Hypnotized, no response.</i>


253
0:25:44,905 --> 0:25:48,476
And the light of Spectra
is the light of the universe.


254
0:25:48,476 --> 0:25:52,313
With that net all over everything,
the light can't get through.


255
0:25:52,313 --> 0:25:55,816
<i>Princess plans to pull Spectra</i>
<i>with spaceship.</i>


256
0:25:55,816 --> 0:25:59,82
<i>Net is for spaceship to hold on to. Orin.</i>


257
0:25:59,82 --> 0:26:1,489
No Orin.


258
0:26:1,489 --> 0:26:3,357
<i>Krys?</i>


259
0:26:3,357 --> 0:26:6,861
Bombo.


260
0:26:6,861 --> 0:26:10,231
Popo, Bodo, Baglo,
Bonglo, Beezo, his cousin Deezo...


261
0:26:10,231 --> 0:26:14,668
Dazzo, Poonch, my brother, my sister,
my nephew, and his friend.


262
0:26:14,668 --> 0:26:17,238
No Orin.


263
0:26:17,238 --> 0:26:20,374
<i>Krys?</i>


264
0:26:20,374 --> 0:26:24,678
Things on Earth will die
if you cover up the diamond.


265
0:26:24,678 --> 0:26:27,681
Earth? What's Earth?


266
0:26:27,681 --> 0:26:32,653
It's the place I bring color to,
a beautiful place full of life.


267
0:26:32,653 --> 0:26:37,591
But it can't live without Spectra's light.
Who hypnotized them all?


268
0:26:37,591 --> 0:26:40,461
-Not me.
-Not our job.


269
0:26:40,461 --> 0:26:44,698
We have to stop them before it's too late.


270
0:26:44,698 --> 0:26:52,506
-Can't talk about it.
-I'm tired of talking myself.


271
0:26:52,506 --> 0:26:57,78
We can do it.


272
0:26:57,78 --> 0:27:10,324
Glitterbots.


273
0:27:10,324 --> 0:27:37,852
Starlite. No.


274
0:27:37,852 --> 0:28:6,58
Hide. Hurry.


275
0:28:6,58 --> 0:28:26,6
Glitterbot.


276
0:28:26,6 --> 0:28:29,77
<i>No Orin, find Krys.</i>


277
0:28:29,77 --> 0:28:32,306
-Krys?
-Who's Krys?


278
0:28:32,306 --> 0:28:43,184
<i>Friend.</i>


279
0:28:43,184 --> 0:28:45,519
<i>Wait a minute.</i>


280
0:28:45,519 --> 0:28:48,923
<i>Open.</i>


281
0:28:48,923 --> 0:28:58,32
At last.


282
0:28:58,32 --> 0:28:59,6
He's not here.


283
0:28:59,6 --> 0:29:2,403
-But the Glitterbots are.
-No.


284
0:29:2,403 --> 0:29:6,207
<i>Emergency.</i>


285
0:29:6,207 --> 0:30:2,596
Hurry.


286
0:30:2,596 --> 0:30:8,402
-Starlite, quick.
-I will not wear booties.


287
0:30:8,402 --> 0:30:15,342
<i>Better than falling down.</i>


288
0:30:15,342 --> 0:30:23,5
My poor dignity.


289
0:30:23,5 --> 0:30:35,496
<i>-Find Orin now?</i>
-Yes.


290
0:30:35,496 --> 0:30:38,966
Boy, Murky, that's a big diamond.


291
0:30:38,966 --> 0:30:40,801
What are we going to do with it?


292
0:30:40,801 --> 0:30:45,272
We're going to crash into it, amoeba-brain.


293
0:30:45,272 --> 0:30:47,441
Hang on.


294
0:30:47,441 --> 0:30:52,579
No. The gloom pipe.


295
0:30:52,579 --> 0:31:0,654
Stop. You're scratching it.


296
0:31:0,654 --> 0:31:9,863
Now, how do we get the diamond
onto the spaceship?


297
0:31:9,863 --> 0:31:13,867
Look what you did, you....


298
0:31:13,867 --> 0:31:16,837
I'll polish it later.


299
0:31:16,837 --> 0:31:21,909
Murky, the Super Gloom Boomer's
all ready.


300
0:31:21,909 --> 0:31:24,278
Not yet, chicken-breath.


301
0:31:24,278 --> 0:31:26,814
First, we're gonna find
that Rainbow Brite...


302
0:31:26,814 --> 0:31:47,301
and use it on her, whoever she is.


303
0:31:47,301 --> 0:32:4,351
<i>Danger.</i>


304
0:32:4,351 --> 0:32:12,593
Seems like the perfect moment
for a swim. Hang on.


305
0:32:12,593 --> 0:32:16,83
I can't get anywhere in this water.


306
0:32:16,83 --> 0:32:20,334
Try.


307
0:32:20,334 --> 0:32:22,436
I'm a magnificent swimmer.


308
0:32:22,436 --> 0:32:37,17
We have to do something
or we'll get hypnotized like the Spectrans.


309
0:32:37,17 --> 0:32:39,887
Get in the boat.


310
0:32:39,887 --> 0:32:44,291
It's a chance for you, at least.


311
0:32:44,291 --> 0:32:47,828
-Hurry.
-The boat won't hold me.


312
0:32:47,828 --> 0:32:50,631
I won't leave you.


313
0:32:50,631 --> 0:33:1,508
They're getting closer.


314
0:33:1,508 --> 0:33:4,378
There are no oars.


315
0:33:4,378 --> 0:33:6,28
And no sail.


316
0:33:6,28 --> 0:33:35,676
There's no way to make the boat go.


317
0:33:35,676 --> 0:33:38,645
I hope he knows where he's going.


318
0:33:38,645 --> 0:33:50,23
Wherever we're going,
it seems like we're going faster.


319
0:33:50,23 --> 0:34:8,575
No!


320
0:34:8,575 --> 0:34:14,214
<i>Emergency.</i>


321
0:34:14,214 --> 0:34:30,931
The rainbow can't get through this mist.


322
0:34:30,931 --> 0:34:47,848
-He saved us.
-Now let's see if he knows how to land.


323
0:34:47,848 --> 0:34:53,42
Well, we got away from the Glitterbots.


324
0:34:53,42 --> 0:35:2,496
But now we've got to get back
and do something about that net.


325
0:35:2,496 --> 0:35:5,499
You think dropping a boat on me
is gonna stop me...


326
0:35:5,499 --> 0:35:10,571
you'd better think again.
Maybe I'm the last one, but I'll fight.


327
0:35:10,571 --> 0:35:13,73
<i>Krys.</i>


328
0:35:13,73 --> 0:35:15,309
On-X. Where's Orin?


329
0:35:15,309 --> 0:35:18,645
<i>Prison. Sent me for help.</i>


330
0:35:18,645 --> 0:35:24,151
<i>-Rainbow Brite.</i>
-Hi.


331
0:35:24,151 --> 0:35:27,287
This is what you call help? A girl?


332
0:35:27,287 --> 0:35:28,789
Orin's locked up someplace.


333
0:35:28,789 --> 0:35:32,225
The Glitterbots have everybody on Spectra
hypnotized but me...


334
0:35:32,225 --> 0:35:35,28
and that's only
because I can run faster than anybody.


335
0:35:35,28 --> 0:35:38,498
The Princess is wrapping the planet up
like a birthday present...


336
0:35:38,498 --> 0:35:40,5
and you bring me a girl?


337
0:35:40,5 --> 0:35:42,669
What princess?


338
0:35:42,669 --> 0:35:46,306
The Princess. She wants to own Spectra.


339
0:35:46,306 --> 0:35:51,11
Nobody can own Spectra.
It's the life of the whole universe.


340
0:35:51,11 --> 0:35:53,747
You go and tell the Princess that.


341
0:35:53,747 --> 0:35:55,682
I guess I'll have to.


342
0:35:55,682 --> 0:35:58,619
Sure. All by yourself?


343
0:35:58,619 --> 0:36:2,723
Just tell me where to find her.


344
0:36:2,723 --> 0:36:5,993
You can come with us if you're not afraid.


345
0:36:5,993 --> 0:36:44,598
I'm braver than any girl.


346
0:36:44,598 --> 0:36:52,406
Murky, how are we gonna get
this whole planet in our spaceship--


347
0:36:52,406 --> 0:36:58,545
Why don't you just go out
and tell those robots where we are?


348
0:36:58,545 --> 0:37:0,414
Okay, Murky.


349
0:37:0,414 --> 0:37:3,483
Stop, rutabaga-brain!


350
0:37:3,483 --> 0:37:8,321
Robots, we're over here.


351
0:37:8,321 --> 0:37:11,491
Here they come, Murky.


352
0:37:11,491 --> 0:37:15,295
Murky, look. A pretty rainbow.


353
0:37:15,295 --> 0:37:19,32
There she goes.


354
0:37:19,32 --> 0:37:21,601
There. Get after her.


355
0:37:21,601 --> 0:37:47,994
We've got to stop her before she stops us.


356
0:37:47,994 --> 0:37:51,798
<i>The weather bureau reports</i>
<i>no sign of an end to the dreariness...</i>


357
0:37:51,798 --> 0:37:54,101
<i>that's bringing the whole world to a stop.</i>


358
0:37:54,101 --> 0:37:56,903
<i>The accident rate is up,</i>
<i>the birth rate is down...</i>


359
0:37:56,903 --> 0:38:0,273
<i>and every country in the world</i>
<i>is blaming the whole situation...</i>


360
0:38:0,273 --> 0:38:2,42
<i>on some other country.</i>


361
0:38:2,42 --> 0:38:5,278
<i>Hospitals report their patients</i>
<i>have stopped asking...</i>


362
0:38:5,278 --> 0:38:6,78
<i>when they'll get better.</i>


363
0:38:6,78 --> 0:38:10,717
<i>Things have become so depressing,</i>
<i>in fact....</i>


364
0:38:10,717 --> 0:38:12,853
<i>In fact, why am I even here?</i>


365
0:38:12,853 --> 0:38:23,63
<i>Why should I be the only one</i>
<i>who hasn't given up?</i>


366
0:38:23,63 --> 0:38:25,999
When she gave it to me,
Rainbow said never to use it...


367
0:38:25,999 --> 0:38:28,602
except in a real emergency.


368
0:38:28,602 --> 0:38:30,303
But this sure looks like it.


369
0:38:30,303 --> 0:38:34,975
If we don't get the color back in the world
soon, there won't be a world.


370
0:38:34,975 --> 0:38:38,311
She said all I have to do
was put it in any door...


371
0:38:38,311 --> 0:38:45,986
and it'll take me to Rainbow Land.


372
0:38:45,986 --> 0:38:52,425
Even the magic's given up.


373
0:38:52,425 --> 0:39:29,329
Rainbow, help!


374
0:39:29,329 --> 0:39:32,899
Intruders!


375
0:39:32,899 --> 0:39:40,607
I didn't invite anybody.


376
0:39:40,607 --> 0:39:44,878
Children.
Children never bring good presents.


377
0:39:44,878 --> 0:39:46,58
Never.


378
0:39:46,58 --> 0:39:57,23
Get rid of them.


379
0:39:57,23 --> 0:40:3,63
I don't like the look of this place.


380
0:40:3,63 --> 0:40:6,499
Rainbow, we can't.


381
0:40:6,499 --> 0:40:9,369
Go back if you want to.


382
0:40:9,369 --> 0:40:19,913
I can do anything you can.


383
0:40:19,913 --> 0:40:21,348
Girls.


384
0:40:21,348 --> 0:40:23,617
We're almost there.


385
0:40:23,617 --> 0:40:25,685
<i>Danger.</i>


386
0:40:25,685 --> 0:40:46,406
I've got to help her.


387
0:40:46,406 --> 0:40:50,911
This is fun.


388
0:40:50,911 --> 0:41:35,21
We should have guests more often.


389
0:41:35,21 --> 0:41:40,93
What do you seek here?


390
0:41:40,93 --> 0:41:43,964
-We have to talk to the Princess.
-Please?


391
0:41:43,964 --> 0:41:55,75
No.


392
0:41:55,75 --> 0:41:56,276
Come on!


393
0:41:56,276 --> 0:41:57,377
This way!


394
0:41:57,377 --> 0:42:0,613
I want that belt.


395
0:42:0,613 --> 0:42:4,184
You even need somebody to tell you
which way to run.


396
0:42:4,184 --> 0:42:10,49
Some of us aren't used to running away.


397
0:42:10,49 --> 0:42:23,67
Hurry.


398
0:42:23,67 --> 0:42:30,61
No.


399
0:42:30,61 --> 0:42:43,189
Hang on to me.


400
0:42:43,189 --> 0:42:49,696
It's an elevator.


401
0:42:49,696 --> 0:42:53,66
One of these
has to take us where the Princess is.


402
0:42:53,66 --> 0:43:33,573
Maybe it's a trap.


403
0:43:33,573 --> 0:43:35,608
Come in.


404
0:43:35,608 --> 0:43:41,481
The Princess has been looking forward
to meeting you.


405
0:43:41,481 --> 0:43:47,62
Where's my present?


406
0:43:47,62 --> 0:43:51,57
How can you think of presents
at a time like this?


407
0:43:51,57 --> 0:43:55,361
That belt is fabulous. Take it off.


408
0:43:55,361 --> 0:43:57,797
Come on, give it to me.


409
0:43:57,797 --> 0:44:0,2
There are some things you can't have.


410
0:44:0,2 --> 0:44:2,635
Don't yell.


411
0:44:2,635 --> 0:44:6,806
You're frightening him.
There, now, it's all right.


412
0:44:6,806 --> 0:44:10,643
Everything's all right.


413
0:44:10,643 --> 0:44:13,613
You have to leave Spectra alone.


414
0:44:13,613 --> 0:44:25,325
Nobody says no to me.


415
0:44:25,325 --> 0:44:32,565
I want the belt.


416
0:44:32,565 --> 0:44:41,608
Stay.


417
0:44:41,608 --> 0:44:51,951
No, Krys.


418
0:44:51,951 --> 0:44:57,891
Got you.


419
0:44:57,891 --> 0:45:2,262
It'll look marvelous with my red dress.


420
0:45:2,262 --> 0:45:15,275
I don't ever want to see them again.


421
0:45:15,275 --> 0:45:19,479
"And all we have to do is walk in
and explain it all to the Princess."


422
0:45:19,479 --> 0:45:21,714
How dumb can a girl get?


423
0:45:21,714 --> 0:45:24,717
If you hadn't been in such a hurry
to be a hero...


424
0:45:24,717 --> 0:45:26,686
I'd still have my belt.


425
0:45:26,686 --> 0:45:28,821
It doesn't matter much.


426
0:45:28,821 --> 0:45:33,26
By the time we get out of here,
the whole universe will be this dark.


427
0:45:33,26 --> 0:45:36,729
We'll find a way.
We have to keep believing, Krys.


428
0:45:36,729 --> 0:45:40,99
I know everybody in Rainbow Land
will be ready to help.


429
0:45:40,99 --> 0:45:46,239
I know there won't be any trouble there.


430
0:45:46,239 --> 0:45:50,41
Come on, Skydancer,
we have to work faster.


431
0:45:50,41 --> 0:45:56,349
More. Faster.


432
0:45:56,349 --> 0:46:3,623
They've got the color console working.


433
0:46:3,623 --> 0:46:12,165
Keep trying.


434
0:46:12,165 --> 0:46:16,135
I've got to find a way to get out of here
without the color belt.


435
0:46:16,135 --> 0:46:20,64
We don't need any belt. We need a ladder.


436
0:46:20,64 --> 0:46:24,744
There's a light.


437
0:46:24,744 --> 0:46:29,48
-On-X.
<i>-Greetings, Krys.</i>


438
0:46:29,48 --> 0:46:31,918
You have to get us out of here.


439
0:46:31,918 --> 0:46:38,224
<i>Oh, no.</i>


440
0:46:38,224 --> 0:46:41,694
Somebody will hear him.


441
0:46:41,694 --> 0:46:43,93
He'll never get in.


442
0:46:43,93 --> 0:46:47,4
On-X, keep trying.


443
0:46:47,4 --> 0:46:51,104
On-X, go and get Starlite.


444
0:46:51,104 --> 0:46:53,573
<i>Starlite. Mission accepted.</i>


445
0:46:53,573 --> 0:46:59,512
Tell him the Princess has the color belt.


446
0:46:59,512 --> 0:47:1,614
A lot of good that's gonna do.


447
0:47:1,614 --> 0:47:4,617
That dumb horse can't even fly
without your rainbow.


448
0:47:4,617 --> 0:47:12,258
He can think.
Which is more than your horse can do.


449
0:47:12,258 --> 0:47:15,395
I've got to get into that castle somehow
and get that belt.


450
0:47:15,395 --> 0:47:17,764
And you've got to make sure
they don't see me.


451
0:47:17,764 --> 0:47:20,366
You start flying around out there.


452
0:47:20,366 --> 0:47:38,885
<i>Plan accepted.</i>


453
0:47:38,885 --> 0:47:40,72
-Krys, look.
-What?


454
0:47:40,72 --> 0:47:48,194
He's back.


455
0:47:48,194 --> 0:47:55,68
Who's making all that noise?


456
0:47:55,68 --> 0:48:5,978
Fire.


457
0:48:5,978 --> 0:48:13,72
Go away.


458
0:48:13,72 --> 0:48:17,256
Get off the bed.


459
0:48:17,256 --> 0:48:34,34
You better start listening to me, all of you.


460
0:48:34,34 --> 0:48:56,829
There must be a stairway
here somewhere.


461
0:48:56,829 --> 0:48:59,132
Up.


462
0:48:59,132 --> 0:49:4,137
Why am I the only one who can
ever do anything around this place?


463
0:49:4,137 --> 0:49:13,913
Meet me at the dungeon.
I'm coming down.


464
0:49:13,913 --> 0:49:16,48
If that tin horse doesn't give himself up...


465
0:49:16,48 --> 0:49:23,723
his little friends
get thrown off my balcony.


466
0:49:23,723 --> 0:49:28,528
Another horse?


467
0:49:28,528 --> 0:49:37,236
No horses in my room.


468
0:49:37,236 --> 0:49:45,144
No horse is getting teeth marks
on my belt.


469
0:49:45,144 --> 0:49:56,489
I want my belt back.


470
0:49:56,489 --> 0:49:59,692
Guards, to the dungeon.


471
0:49:59,692 --> 0:50:4,23
Not you. You get that horse.


472
0:50:4,23 --> 0:50:9,168
He's got the color belt.


473
0:50:9,168 --> 0:50:14,507
Try, On-X.


474
0:50:14,507 --> 0:50:32,91
We've got to find a way to get up there
and get it from him.


475
0:50:32,91 --> 0:51:10,663
<i>Danger!</i>


476
0:51:10,663 --> 0:51:13,833
Bring my belt back here this minute!


477
0:51:13,833 --> 0:51:18,337
You'll never get away with this.


478
0:51:18,337 --> 0:51:31,684
You'll never, ever get away with this.


479
0:51:31,684 --> 0:51:36,88
We've got to get that magic jewel.
That's the only way to stop her.


480
0:51:36,88 --> 0:51:37,89
I need more power.


481
0:51:37,89 --> 0:51:41,327
We've got to get back to Rainbow Land
and get more star sprinkle.


482
0:51:41,327 --> 0:51:42,995
And we've got to hurry.


483
0:51:42,995 --> 0:51:56,75
I hope that rainbow's still strong enough
to get us there.


484
0:51:56,75 --> 0:52:6,819
Banish them
where they'll never bother me again.


485
0:52:6,819 --> 0:52:9,422
<i>Danger.</i>


486
0:52:9,422 --> 0:52:13,192
Rainbow! Watch out!


487
0:52:13,192 --> 0:52:33,279
Faster, Starlite!
We've got to get away from it.


488
0:52:33,279 --> 0:52:44,857
Krys, get to Rainbow Land! Get help!


489
0:52:44,857 --> 0:53:2,274
On-X, try.


490
0:53:2,274 --> 0:53:9,148
Starlite, jump!


491
0:53:9,148 --> 0:53:33,572
Oh, no!


492
0:53:33,572 --> 0:53:36,42
Boy, what a ride.


493
0:53:36,42 --> 0:53:43,249
-Where are we?
-Wherever we are, I'm not staying.


494
0:53:43,249 --> 0:53:55,961
Oh, no. Its power's used up.


495
0:53:55,961 --> 0:53:58,397
I haven't lost all my power.


496
0:53:58,397 --> 0:54:3,102
-Throw down that belt.
-No.


497
0:54:3,102 --> 0:54:7,44
-You'll stay up there till you do.
-You can't keep us up here.


498
0:54:7,44 --> 0:54:10,876
Prisoners don't talk back.


499
0:54:10,876 --> 0:54:14,113
Sgt. Zombo reporting to the Princess.


500
0:54:14,113 --> 0:54:17,49
If she ever wants to come down
from there, Your Highness...


501
0:54:17,49 --> 0:54:32,765
she'll give me the belt.


502
0:54:32,765 --> 0:54:36,936
His name's not Starlite.
His name's Crusader.


503
0:54:36,936 --> 0:54:49,14
He's my horse now.


504
0:54:49,14 --> 0:54:51,283
I'll get your horse back.


505
0:54:51,283 --> 0:54:54,42
We'll get him back.


506
0:54:54,42 --> 0:54:59,24
Come on, On-X.


507
0:54:59,24 --> 0:55:9,468
<i>Obstacle.</i>


508
0:55:9,468 --> 0:55:21,647
<i>Obstacle removed.</i>


509
0:55:21,647 --> 0:55:24,116
New ones.


510
0:55:24,116 --> 0:55:28,387
I remember when we tried to get away.


511
0:55:28,387 --> 0:55:33,492
I can't remember that far back.


512
0:55:33,492 --> 0:55:38,531
Help me, hopscotch-brain! Get me down.


513
0:55:38,531 --> 0:55:41,233
We've got to find out
where they put our spaceship.


514
0:55:41,233 --> 0:55:44,203
I'll get you down, Murky.


515
0:55:44,203 --> 0:55:51,11
I'm hurrying, Murky.


516
0:55:51,11 --> 0:55:53,746
No. Put me down.


517
0:55:53,746 --> 0:55:57,249
I don't see
the spaceship anywhere, Murky.


518
0:55:57,249 --> 0:56:2,621
Put me down.


519
0:56:2,621 --> 0:56:5,257
Lurky, there's someone coming.


520
0:56:5,257 --> 0:56:29,481
No.


521
0:56:29,481 --> 0:56:40,259
Where did he go?


522
0:56:40,259 --> 0:56:43,195
Yes, Your Highness?


523
0:56:43,195 --> 0:56:52,338
Yes, Your Highness.
The new prisoners have escaped.


524
0:56:52,338 --> 0:57:2,715
Who said that?


525
0:57:2,715 --> 0:57:8,153
-We'll never get in there.
-lf you're too scared, stay here.


526
0:57:8,153 --> 0:57:25,471
I'm not scared of anything.


527
0:57:25,471 --> 0:57:27,84
<i>Danger.</i>


528
0:57:27,84 --> 0:57:31,1
<i>Passenger too heavy.</i>


529
0:57:31,1 --> 0:57:37,216
Get off my horse.


530
0:57:37,216 --> 0:57:44,623
I'm coming, On-X!


531
0:57:44,623 --> 0:58:9,214
<i>Over....</i>


532
0:58:9,214 --> 0:58:12,384
<i>Overload.</i>


533
0:58:12,384 --> 0:59:41,774
Oh, no!


534
0:59:41,774 --> 0:59:46,278
There.


535
0:59:46,278 --> 1:0:13,939
Star sprinkles.


536
1:0:13,939 --> 1:0:23,949
This way.


537
1:0:23,949 --> 1:0:39,565
No.


538
1:0:39,565 --> 1:0:49,374
Watch out.


539
1:0:49,374 --> 1:0:52,644
Can your rainbow get us up there?


540
1:0:52,644 --> 1:1:1,987
The rainbow can take us anywhere.


541
1:1:1,987 --> 1:1:4,89
Where did you get those star sprinkles?


542
1:1:4,89 --> 1:1:7,326
Magic and I are old friends.


543
1:1:7,326 --> 1:1:11,363
How did you know my name?


544
1:1:11,363 --> 1:1:14,6
I sent my horse to fetch you.


545
1:1:14,6 --> 1:1:16,668
-You're....
-Orin.


546
1:1:16,668 --> 1:1:19,4
I heard the Princess sent you here.


547
1:1:19,4 --> 1:1:23,275
I've been searching all over for....
But there's no time for chitchat now.


548
1:1:23,275 --> 1:1:26,512
Spectra grows darker by the moment.


549
1:1:26,512 --> 1:1:30,15
There is one thing we have to do first.


550
1:1:30,15 --> 1:1:49,168
What could possibly be more important
than saving the universe?


551
1:1:49,168 --> 1:1:53,705
-Your power is his only chance.
-And Starlite's.


552
1:1:53,705 --> 1:1:58,76
I think the time has come
for Krys to have this.


553
1:1:58,76 --> 1:2:0,979
I knew you the two of you
would meet one day.


554
1:2:0,979 --> 1:2:6,385
Its magic has endured
since the most ancient times.


555
1:2:6,385 --> 1:2:9,521
He'll need the power of your rainbow
to make it work.


556
1:2:9,521 --> 1:2:14,26
But with your help, he'll be the warrior
he's always dreamed of being.


557
1:2:14,26 --> 1:2:16,628
If we can get it to him.


558
1:2:16,628 --> 1:2:35,314
I'll get it to him.


559
1:2:35,314 --> 1:2:40,118
Wipe that smile off your....


560
1:2:40,118 --> 1:2:46,592
-Murky, look.
-Stop her.


561
1:2:46,592 --> 1:2:54,299
Rainbow!


562
1:2:54,299 --> 1:2:59,204
Stand still.


563
1:2:59,204 --> 1:3:2,941
Get out of the way.


564
1:3:2,941 --> 1:3:8,58
Get away from there.


565
1:3:8,58 --> 1:3:14,886
Put this on your wrist.


566
1:3:14,886 --> 1:3:16,555
Out of the way.


567
1:3:16,555 --> 1:3:18,19
Attention!


568
1:3:18,19 --> 1:3:24,796
You.


569
1:3:24,796 --> 1:3:38,944
-What does it do?
-I forgot to ask.


570
1:3:38,944 --> 1:3:52,157
Thanks, Rainbow.


571
1:3:52,157 --> 1:4:2,534
How can they build a fort
with only one gate?


572
1:4:2,534 --> 1:4:5,904
Now we'll stop the Princess.


573
1:4:5,904 --> 1:4:12,144
Let's go.


574
1:4:12,144 --> 1:4:17,683
We caught them trying to escape,
Your Highness.


575
1:4:17,683 --> 1:4:21,353
They are not the ones I want.
I want Rainbow Brite.


576
1:4:21,353 --> 1:4:22,788
And her belt.


577
1:4:22,788 --> 1:4:26,258
Not on my throne.


578
1:4:26,258 --> 1:4:28,66
I know they don't have a present for me.


579
1:4:28,66 --> 1:4:33,265
We do have a present for you,
Your Highness.


580
1:4:33,265 --> 1:4:36,435
You didn't have to.


581
1:4:36,435 --> 1:4:39,738
We're going to give you Rainbow Brite.


582
1:4:39,738 --> 1:4:45,143
You're going to do
what all my forces couldn't do?


583
1:4:45,143 --> 1:4:49,247
Your Highness,
we've been fighting that Rainbow brat...


584
1:4:49,247 --> 1:4:52,851
for years and years and years.


585
1:4:52,851 --> 1:4:55,153
We know her weak spots.


586
1:4:55,153 --> 1:5:0,125
Then why haven't you stopped her?


587
1:5:0,125 --> 1:5:2,461
-Answer the question.
-Why?


588
1:5:2,461 --> 1:5:7,432
Because, Your Highness....


589
1:5:7,432 --> 1:5:10,836
Because we were waiting
until she led us...


590
1:5:10,836 --> 1:5:13,338
to where she keeps all her belts.


591
1:5:13,338 --> 1:5:16,842
She has more belts?


592
1:5:16,842 --> 1:5:19,578
Dozens of them, Your Highness.


593
1:5:19,578 --> 1:5:22,414
Go after her. Bring her back here.


594
1:5:22,414 --> 1:5:26,651
Meanwhile, your spaceship
will be bringing you Spectra.


595
1:5:26,651 --> 1:5:29,588
I'll have everything.


596
1:5:29,588 --> 1:5:40,499
I deserve everything.


597
1:5:40,499 --> 1:5:44,336
Murky, how are we gonna
catch Rainbow Brite?


598
1:5:44,336 --> 1:5:47,973
We're not going to catch her,
kangaroo-brain.


599
1:5:47,973 --> 1:5:57,416
We're going after that diamond.


600
1:5:57,416 --> 1:6:0,152
It's not Murky and Lurky
I'm worried about.


601
1:6:0,152 --> 1:6:2,654
It's the Princess' spaceship.


602
1:6:2,654 --> 1:6:6,57
The only way to stop that ship
from reaching Spectra...


603
1:6:6,57 --> 1:6:8,927
is to destroy the source of its power.


604
1:6:8,927 --> 1:6:10,695
The magic jewel?


605
1:6:10,695 --> 1:6:15,967
The source of all her power.
And she will use it all to stop you.


606
1:6:15,967 --> 1:6:20,939
The castle's defenses are strong,
but there is a way in.


607
1:6:20,939 --> 1:6:25,11
A way so perilous that it is left unguarded.


608
1:6:25,11 --> 1:6:28,547
A wheel turns at the foot of the tower.


609
1:6:28,547 --> 1:6:30,582
If you're not afraid....


610
1:6:30,582 --> 1:6:33,618
-I'm not.
-I'm not afraid of anything.


611
1:6:33,618 --> 1:6:36,154
You have the prism now.


612
1:6:36,154 --> 1:6:38,19
-But how does it--
-Work?


613
1:6:38,19 --> 1:6:42,894
Just as you saw.
All you have to do is need it.


614
1:6:42,894 --> 1:6:47,933
It will do its job
as long as your purpose is true...


615
1:6:47,933 --> 1:6:50,135
and the rainbow is near.


616
1:6:50,135 --> 1:6:52,3
And I must do my job.


617
1:6:52,3 --> 1:6:57,142
Spectra must be kept alive
until you've destroyed the stone.


618
1:6:57,142 --> 1:7:0,579
I'm afraid I'll have to borrow my horse.


619
1:7:0,579 --> 1:7:5,183
Old On-X, trusty steed of noble voice.


620
1:7:5,183 --> 1:7:14,226
You can ride with me on Starlite.


621
1:7:14,226 --> 1:7:17,229
<i>Orin.</i>


622
1:7:17,229 --> 1:7:22,4
And remember,
the whole universe depends on you.


623
1:7:22,4 --> 1:7:46,458
Be brave, be bold,
and don't fight with each other.


624
1:7:46,458 --> 1:7:50,195
I don't like the idea
of you going up there without me.


625
1:7:50,195 --> 1:8:3,642
I'll send the rainbow down for you
as soon as it's safe to use it.


626
1:8:3,642 --> 1:8:9,648
No.


627
1:8:9,648 --> 1:8:18,69
Krys, jump.


628
1:8:18,69 --> 1:8:21,726
Come on. Get it loaded.


629
1:8:21,726 --> 1:8:25,297
They're not taking away
any diamonds, are they?


630
1:8:25,297 --> 1:8:28,99
No. Just worthless minerals,
Your Highness.


631
1:8:28,99 --> 1:8:32,7
The engines melt them
and turn them into fuel.


632
1:8:32,7 --> 1:8:33,605
Those spider legs...


633
1:8:33,605 --> 1:8:36,875
will take hold of the net
we've woven around Spectra.


634
1:8:36,875 --> 1:8:42,414
The greatest diamond in the universe
is almost yours.


635
1:8:42,414 --> 1:8:44,316
Mine.


636
1:8:44,316 --> 1:8:59,698
I've always loved the sound of that word.


637
1:8:59,698 --> 1:9:11,443
-You broke it.
-I didn't break it.


638
1:9:11,443 --> 1:9:17,582
-Do you mind?
-I didn't mean it.


639
1:9:17,582 --> 1:9:19,551
-Can you swim?
-Sure.


640
1:9:19,551 --> 1:9:32,364
Good.


641
1:9:32,364 --> 1:9:34,532
Why, at a moment like this...


642
1:9:34,532 --> 1:9:37,802
is the most magnificent horse
in the universe...


643
1:9:37,802 --> 1:9:48,647
standing here doing nothing at all?


644
1:9:48,647 --> 1:9:50,915
I want that ship on its way in one hour.


645
1:9:50,915 --> 1:9:52,917
Less than an hour, Your Highness.


646
1:9:52,917 --> 1:10:7,432
I do want that diamond.


647
1:10:7,432 --> 1:10:54,79
Oh, no!


648
1:10:54,79 --> 1:10:57,482
I don't know why
they don't think keep horses in mind...


649
1:10:57,482 --> 1:11:20,905
when they design a castle. Here goes.


650
1:11:20,905 --> 1:11:23,41
-Spectra.
-Orin.


651
1:11:23,41 --> 1:11:26,678
Come on. He's doing his job. Let's do ours.


652
1:11:26,678 --> 1:11:39,39
Let's get that jewel.


653
1:11:39,39 --> 1:11:44,95
They never even noticed me.
Nobody ever notices me.


654
1:11:44,95 --> 1:11:47,165
Just hurry, my friend.


655
1:11:47,165 --> 1:11:51,169
Talk a little less, work a little more.


656
1:11:51,169 --> 1:11:57,308
I don't know how just the two of us
are going to save the whole universe.


657
1:11:57,308 --> 1:12:1,98
There are three more,
but they should've been back by now.


658
1:12:1,98 --> 1:12:18,129
I can't even see the Earth anymore.


659
1:12:18,129 --> 1:12:22,333
She'll come through. I know she will.


660
1:12:22,333 --> 1:12:58,69
You have to, Rainbow.


661
1:12:58,69 --> 1:13:2,106
Come on.


662
1:13:2,106 --> 1:13:5,577
Lurky, get back there and fix that engine.


663
1:13:5,577 --> 1:13:9,547
Murky, look. Rainbow Land.


664
1:13:9,547 --> 1:13:13,785
Goody, I get to sleep
in my own bed tonight.


665
1:13:13,785 --> 1:13:17,355
That's not Rainbow Land, alfalfa-breath.


666
1:13:17,355 --> 1:13:22,56
That's....


667
1:13:22,56 --> 1:13:32,403
It's....


668
1:13:32,403 --> 1:13:35,907
My belt. You've brought it back.


669
1:13:35,907 --> 1:13:39,344
-To stop you.
-You're too late.


670
1:13:39,344 --> 1:13:54,325
My spaceship is all ready to take off
to bring my diamond home.


671
1:13:54,325 --> 1:14:6,104
We can do it, Krys.


672
1:14:6,104 --> 1:14:15,179
I need your power.


673
1:14:15,179 --> 1:14:19,317
Now I've got you.


674
1:14:19,317 --> 1:14:43,942
You stay right where you are.


675
1:14:43,942 --> 1:14:48,846
Nobody touches that throne but me.


676
1:14:48,846 --> 1:14:52,16
See, Murky? It is Rainbow Land.


677
1:14:52,16 --> 1:14:54,819
Now, Krys.


678
1:14:54,819 --> 1:14:58,323
No!


679
1:14:58,323 --> 1:15:6,998
Stop!


680
1:15:6,998 --> 1:15:15,239
No!


681
1:15:15,239 --> 1:15:27,418
It's all right. I won't let them hurt you.


682
1:15:27,418 --> 1:15:31,155
-We did it.
-We won.


683
1:15:31,155 --> 1:15:34,926
Not so fast.


684
1:15:34,926 --> 1:15:46,204
Now I've got you
right where I want you, Rainbow Brite.


685
1:15:46,204 --> 1:16:9,26
See, Murky?
I told you it was Rainbow Land.


686
1:16:9,26 --> 1:16:14,599
Look.


687
1:16:14,599 --> 1:16:20,838
You thought you stopped me?
You little brats.


688
1:16:20,838 --> 1:16:24,42
No. She's heading for Spectra.


689
1:16:24,42 --> 1:16:32,35
We've got to stop her.


690
1:16:32,35 --> 1:16:36,287
Hi, I'm Bombo. Polisher first-class.


691
1:16:36,287 --> 1:16:38,389
What's all this?


692
1:16:38,389 --> 1:16:44,796
He's not hypnotized anymore.


693
1:16:44,796 --> 1:16:53,137
They all stopped.


694
1:16:53,137 --> 1:17:0,211
-You did it.
-What's that?


695
1:17:0,211 --> 1:17:6,984
You can't stop me now. You can't!


696
1:17:6,984 --> 1:17:9,253
Not now.


697
1:17:9,253 --> 1:17:13,224
We can't be out of fuel now.


698
1:17:13,224 --> 1:17:29,44
There must be something.


699
1:17:29,44 --> 1:17:31,209
It's going to crash.


700
1:17:31,209 --> 1:17:40,351
And this whole planet
will shatter into a billion pieces.


701
1:17:40,351 --> 1:17:46,757
If I can't have that diamond,
no one's going to have it.


702
1:17:46,757 --> 1:17:56,734
I always get my way in the end.


703
1:17:56,734 --> 1:18:32,87
No, not the rainbow.


704
1:18:32,87 --> 1:18:50,821
She did it!


705
1:18:50,821 --> 1:19:5,236
Thanks, Rainbow.


706
1:19:5,236 --> 1:19:14,11
See? Everything's fine.


707
1:19:14,11 --> 1:19:24,956
Welcome to Rainbow Land, Krys.


708
1:19:24,956 --> 1:19:26,657
Winter's a whole lot easier...


709
1:19:26,657 --> 1:19:29,66
but I think next winter,
I'm taking a vacation.


710
1:19:29,66 --> 1:19:39,737
We'll all help fix things up.


711
1:19:39,737 --> 1:19:43,808
We have time now. The universe is safe.


712
1:19:43,808 --> 1:19:48,446
The universe is alive again.
There's color, joy, and hope again.


713
1:19:48,446 --> 1:19:52,783
And we'll keep it that way.


714
1:19:52,783 --> 1:19:57,688
You'll need help, you know.


715
1:19:57,688 --> 1:20:5,463
-You mean it?
-He's your horse now.


716
1:20:5,463 --> 1:20:7,265
We'll all work together.


717
1:20:7,265 --> 1:20:30,588
And keep the universe
bright and beautiful forever.


718
1:20:30,588 --> 1:20:33,624
Maybe Rainbow Land is that way, Murky.


719
1:20:33,624 --> 1:24:34,665
Or this way. Or maybe it's that.


720
1:24:34,665 --> 1:26:34,665
English
