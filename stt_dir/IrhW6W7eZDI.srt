2
0:0:17,15 --> 0:0:20,94
CHRIS HARRIS: Couldn't get more
American if we tried--


3
0:0:20,94 --> 0:0:24,18
Manhattan skyline and the two
muscle cars of the moment--


4
0:0:24,18 --> 0:0:27,9
Camaro ZL1 and Mustang GT500.


5
0:0:27,9 --> 0:0:31,14
Between them, they have
1,259 horsepower.


6
0:0:31,14 --> 0:0:35,93
And yet they cost a lot less
than a 997 Turbo S.


7
0:0:35,93 --> 0:0:37,27
So I've got two days
with these cars.


8
0:0:37,27 --> 0:0:39,35
I want to drive them in New
York, because that's a fun


9
0:0:39,35 --> 0:0:39,94
thing to do.


10
0:0:39,94 --> 0:0:40,99
And then I want to drive
them on a circuit.


11
0:0:40,99 --> 0:0:43,16
And then I want to reach
some conclusions


12
0:0:43,16 --> 0:0:43,75
about the two of them.


13
0:0:43,75 --> 0:0:46,27
As a European, I'm massively
excited.


14
0:0:46,27 --> 0:0:47,75
Because they're so powerful,
and they


15
0:0:47,75 --> 0:0:49,378
represent so much value.


16
0:0:49,378 --> 0:0:51,82
Let's get it on.


17
0:0:51,82 --> 0:0:55,24
So is this the worst place on
the planet to drive a car?


18
0:0:55,24 --> 0:0:55,92
MALE SPEAKER: To drive?


19
0:0:55,92 --> 0:0:56,57
CHRIS HARRIS: Could
be, couldn't it?


20
0:0:56,57 --> 0:0:57,28
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
I think so.


21
0:0:57,28 --> 0:0:59,69
CHRIS HARRIS: Could be.


22
0:0:59,69 --> 0:1:4,45
Anyhow, at least I've
got a Camaro ZL1.


23
0:1:4,45 --> 0:1:5,74
I suppose I'd better get that
straight first, haven't I?


24
0:1:5,74 --> 0:1:8,4
Am I going to call it
a ZL1 or a Zed L1?


25
0:1:8,4 --> 0:1:13,14
I suppose, being in America,
I ought to call it a ZL1.


26
0:1:13,14 --> 0:1:17,88
Luckily and handily for these
purposes, General Motors has


27
0:1:17,88 --> 0:1:22,1
decided to detune the
ZR1 Corvette engine


28
0:1:22,1 --> 0:1:23,59
and put it in a Camaro.


29
0:1:23,59 --> 0:1:27,336
And it's only got
588 horsepower.


30
0:1:27,336 --> 0:1:28,9
Get that?


31
0:1:28,9 --> 0:1:30,11
Detuned to 588.


32
0:1:30,11 --> 0:1:32,46
566 foot-pounds of torque.


33
0:1:32,46 --> 0:1:35,77
And I'm going to be able to
demonstrate about, oh, seven


34
0:1:35,77 --> 0:1:37,34
of those, I would have thought,


35
0:1:37,34 --> 0:1:39,42
where we're going now.


36
0:1:39,42 --> 0:1:40,26
Initial thoughts, then?


37
0:1:40,26 --> 0:1:42,95
It's not a difficult car
to drive slowly, this.


38
0:1:42,95 --> 0:1:45,34
It's not a difficult
car at all.


39
0:1:45,34 --> 0:1:49,26
Three petals, clutch is fine,
gearbox is light.


40
0:1:49,26 --> 0:1:51,63
We forget that, don't we, that
if you had a car with this


41
0:1:51,63 --> 0:1:54,48
much power 15 years ago--
actually, they didn't exist,


42
0:1:54,48 --> 0:1:57,22
did they-- but a mega horsepower
car had awful


43
0:1:57,22 --> 0:1:59,64
slackness in the gearshift,
and the whole transmission


44
0:1:59,64 --> 0:2:2,11
moved around on rubber mounts
and it felt horrible.


45
0:2:2,11 --> 0:2:3,55
This doesn't feel like that.


46
0:2:3,55 --> 0:2:4,38
It's a little bit of slot.


47
0:2:4,38 --> 0:2:5,64
But it's tight.


48
0:2:5,64 --> 0:2:7,0
And it's easy to drive.


49
0:2:7,0 --> 0:2:9,889



50
0:2:9,889 --> 0:2:10,78
I like the cabin too.


51
0:2:10,78 --> 0:2:13,39
This thing is $48,000 basic.


52
0:2:13,39 --> 0:2:21,3
So it's kind of slightly
well-equipped 325i BMW money.


53
0:2:21,3 --> 0:2:24,918
And you get 588 horsepower.


54
0:2:24,918 --> 0:2:27,2
I don't have very good form
with New York City.


55
0:2:27,2 --> 0:2:31,21
I've been here once before and
I got off the plane, had a


56
0:2:31,21 --> 0:2:33,76
good afternoon, and then
the lights went off.


57
0:2:33,76 --> 0:2:36,48
This was August, 2003--


58
0:2:36,48 --> 0:2:37,896
I think it was-- when they
had the blackout.


59
0:2:37,896 --> 0:2:39,54
I got stuck here for two days.


60
0:2:39,54 --> 0:2:44,32
I spent $500 to sleep on some
stranger's floor one night.


61
0:2:44,32 --> 0:2:45,57
So I don't have much
good history.


62
0:2:45,57 --> 0:2:48,1
But I do find it a great place
to come on [INAUDIBLE].


63
0:2:48,1 --> 0:2:49,53
And it's good for cars too.


64
0:2:49,53 --> 0:2:51,84
You see some really interesting
cars, because


65
0:2:51,84 --> 0:2:55,8
people just seem to use some
old, eclectic stuff and leave


66
0:2:55,8 --> 0:2:55,76
it on the street side.


67
0:2:55,76 --> 0:2:59,63
This morning I saw
a BMW E28 525e.


68
0:2:59,63 --> 0:3:1,4
I was just cooing all over it.


69
0:3:1,4 --> 0:3:1,97
People thought I was mad.


70
0:3:1,97 --> 0:3:4,62
But it looked so incongruous and
cool next to all the other


71
0:3:4,62 --> 0:3:6,81
new, modern cars.


72
0:3:6,81 --> 0:3:7,69
Ah, look.


73
0:3:7,69 --> 0:3:10,701
G63 or G55.


74
0:3:10,701 --> 0:3:14,755
G55.


75
0:3:14,755 --> 0:3:18,36
Are you allowed to drive a G55
if you've not got a Russian


76
0:3:18,36 --> 0:3:20,387
passport and a cocaine habit?


77
0:3:20,387 --> 0:3:22,343
[LAUGHTER]


78
0:3:22,343 --> 0:3:26,146
MALE SPEAKER: Getting a lot of
looks around here, though, in


79
0:3:26,146 --> 0:3:26,504
these two cars.


80
0:3:26,504 --> 0:3:28,412
That's for sure.


81
0:3:28,412 --> 0:3:30,83
CHRIS HARRIS: That's what it's
all about though, isn't it?


82
0:3:30,83 --> 0:3:33,722
They are partly about being seen
and heard, aren't they?


83
0:3:33,722 --> 0:3:36,565
They're pretty good at it too.


84
0:3:36,565 --> 0:3:41,54
I'm at a red light and it's
clear road ahead of us.


85
0:3:41,54 --> 0:3:43,35
So the temptation is to
make a lot of noise.


86
0:3:43,35 --> 0:3:45,938
But I don't know, is that a bad
thing to do in New York?


87
0:3:45,938 --> 0:3:47,894
What's it like in first gear?


88
0:3:47,894 --> 0:3:50,339
[ENGINE SOUNDS]


89
0:3:50,339 --> 0:3:54,17
CHRIS HARRIS: It's
quite quick.


90
0:3:54,17 --> 0:3:55,5
I went a bit more
than 30 there.


91
0:3:55,5 --> 0:3:57,952
MALE SPEAKER: What's the
speed limit here?


92
0:3:57,952 --> 0:3:59,8
CHRIS HARRIS: It's a lovely
thing to tool around in.


93
0:3:59,8 --> 0:4:0,37
I like it.


94
0:4:0,37 --> 0:4:2,22
The seat is nice.


95
0:4:2,22 --> 0:4:3,586
They've been quite
clever here.


96
0:4:3,586 --> 0:4:6,22
Everything that you touch has
got sort of Alcantara on it.


97
0:4:6,22 --> 0:4:7,51
So all the contact points--
there's a stumpy little gear


98
0:4:7,51 --> 0:4:10,74
lever here which looks
like it was just


99
0:4:10,74 --> 0:4:13,42
nicked from an M5 actually.


100
0:4:13,42 --> 0:4:16,436
It feels great, because it's
all quite a soft touch.


101
0:4:16,436 --> 0:4:17,37
I like this thing.


102
0:4:17,37 --> 0:4:20,51
Strangely when I said I liked
it, everyone back at the Drive


103
0:4:20,51 --> 0:4:22,22
office just went, [GROAN],
it's a Camaro.


104
0:4:22,22 --> 0:4:23,11
I don't like them.


105
0:4:23,11 --> 0:4:24,4
It's wrong.


106
0:4:24,4 --> 0:4:27,67
They're all very pro-Mustang.


107
0:4:27,67 --> 0:4:29,39
Of course, being a complete
foreigner, I don't really


108
0:4:29,39 --> 0:4:32,51
understand the complexities and
the subtleties of the Ford


109
0:4:32,51 --> 0:4:33,865
versus Chevrolet thing.


110
0:4:33,865 --> 0:4:36,5
I just want to take them on
merit, really, and judge them.


111
0:4:36,5 --> 0:4:39,33
This, to me, feels like
a nicely resolved car.


112
0:4:39,33 --> 0:4:42,84
So I'm going to spend a bit of
time making sure that it


113
0:4:42,84 --> 0:4:44,37
shifts gear well at low
speed, that the


114
0:4:44,37 --> 0:4:46,705
engine's got usable torque.


115
0:4:46,705 --> 0:4:49,85
It may have massive numbers,
but it's up to you how much


116
0:4:49,85 --> 0:4:51,654
you use of it.


117
0:4:51,654 --> 0:4:53,46
And that's all I'm going
to say about


118
0:4:53,46 --> 0:4:54,555
driving the ZL1 slowly.


119
0:4:54,555 --> 0:4:56,93
Because we need to go and do
some stupid stuff with it,


120
0:4:56,93 --> 0:5:0,47
really, don't we?


121
0:5:0,47 --> 0:5:6,33
So this is a Mustang GT500.


122
0:5:6,33 --> 0:5:9,816
Its numbers are so
extraordinary, I'm not even


123
0:5:9,816 --> 0:5:11,3
going to mention them now.


124
0:5:11,3 --> 0:5:13,76
I'm just going to sort of settle
myself into the beast.


125
0:5:13,76 --> 0:5:15,26
And then we'll discuss the
numbers in a minute.


126
0:5:15,26 --> 0:5:18,6
Because they are,
frankly, [BLEEP]


127
0:5:18,6 --> 0:5:19,31
ridiculous.


128
0:5:19,31 --> 0:5:23,28



129
0:5:23,28 --> 0:5:25,49
This is a bit brutal,
isn't it?


130
0:5:25,49 --> 0:5:26,84
Jesus.


131
0:5:26,84 --> 0:5:28,9
Talk about a short shift.


132
0:5:28,9 --> 0:5:30,46



133
0:5:30,46 --> 0:5:34,91
To quote the best motoring
journalist cliche of all, it's


134
0:5:34,91 --> 0:5:36,16
like a rifle bolt.


135
0:5:36,16 --> 0:5:41,42



136
0:5:41,42 --> 0:5:41,87
[BLEEP]


137
0:5:41,87 --> 0:5:43,737
me, that's fast.


138
0:5:43,737 --> 0:5:46,26
It's got loads of grunt.


139
0:5:46,26 --> 0:5:47,96
I feel like I'm sitting in
a Range Rover, though.


140
0:5:47,96 --> 0:5:49,955
I'm too high relative to
the steering wheel.


141
0:5:49,955 --> 0:5:52,59
If I was to get twirly in
oversteer, I could probably


142
0:5:52,59 --> 0:5:57,55
shave my testicles with the
bottom of the wheel.


143
0:5:57,55 --> 0:6:0,64
It's actually not the easiest
car to drive slowly, whereas


144
0:6:0,64 --> 0:6:3,69
the ZL1 really does just feel
to me like any sort of three


145
0:6:3,69 --> 0:6:5,55
pedal, American, fast car.


146
0:6:5,55 --> 0:6:7,3
This is a bit more difficult.


147
0:6:7,3 --> 0:6:9,32
The clutch bite point is high.


148
0:6:9,32 --> 0:6:11,563
Because of this seat being in
the wrong position, my angle


149
0:6:11,563 --> 0:6:14,72
of attack from my knee down to
the petals is a bit funny.


150
0:6:14,72 --> 0:6:17,43
I'm sitting too high relative
to the wheel.


151
0:6:17,43 --> 0:6:19,99
And of course there's
that power figure.


152
0:6:19,99 --> 0:6:22,68
We'll come to it now.


153
0:6:22,68 --> 0:6:27,55
671 horsepower.


154
0:6:27,55 --> 0:6:28,55
Say that to yourself.


155
0:6:28,55 --> 0:6:33,93
671 horsepower through,
effectively, a live axle.


156
0:6:33,93 --> 0:6:35,96
It's just barking, isn't it?


157
0:6:35,96 --> 0:6:39,62
Who was it who said, sort of
post-Lehman that Ford and GM


158
0:6:39,62 --> 0:6:42,21
were going to have to sort their
shit out and stop making


159
0:6:42,21 --> 0:6:42,85
muscle cars.


160
0:6:42,85 --> 0:6:45,79
Well, a few years later,
we're at the 670


161
0:6:45,79 --> 0:6:47,565
horsepower Mustang mark.


162
0:6:47,565 --> 0:6:49,83
So someone called that
wrong, didn't they?


163
0:6:49,83 --> 0:6:50,25
Torque--


164
0:6:50,25 --> 0:6:53,14
631 foot-pounds.


165
0:6:53,14 --> 0:6:54,4
It's a monster.


166
0:6:54,4 --> 0:6:57,14
It's a much, much, more powerful
machine than that yob


167
0:6:57,14 --> 0:7:0,756
yellow thing behind me, which
itself is crazy enough.


168
0:7:0,756 --> 0:7:2,34
I love it.


169
0:7:2,34 --> 0:7:6,5
And the price of these things--
they are $35 grand


170
0:7:6,5 --> 0:7:8,85
cars if they were sold in the
UK at the same price as they


171
0:7:8,85 --> 0:7:9,8
are over here.


172
0:7:9,8 --> 0:7:13,2
So you could have the thick end
of 700 horsepower for the


173
0:7:13,2 --> 0:7:16,99
price of a sort of mid-style,
three series BMW.


174
0:7:16,99 --> 0:7:19,31
Isn't that something
to be celebrated?


175
0:7:19,31 --> 0:7:21,56
When you get to that sort of
level, I don't really care


176
0:7:21,56 --> 0:7:23,23
about the way they handle
or whether they're as


177
0:7:23,23 --> 0:7:24,16
good as a BMW M3.


178
0:7:24,16 --> 0:7:28,13
It makes no odds whatsoever,
does it?


179
0:7:28,13 --> 0:7:30,27
Obviously, I'm a limey
tourist here today.

0:7:30,27 --> 0:7:31,83
We've driven around New York.

0:7:31,83 --> 0:7:32,66
And we've seen a few
bits and bobs.

0:7:32,66 --> 0:7:35,64
But J.R. said, if there's one
place you want to go to, where


183
0:7:35,64 --> 0:7:37,55
would it be?


184
0:7:37,55 --> 0:7:39,66
Times Square, all that stuff--
not really very interested.


185
0:7:39,66 --> 0:7:41,58
I like the Chrysler building,
but I've seen that before.

0:7:44,5 --> 0:7:46,33
But there was one place I wanted
to visit, and I've


189
0:7:46,33 --> 0:7:49,25
always wanted to visit ever
since I first saw a little


190
0:7:49,25 --> 0:7:51,52
program called The Sopranos.

0:7:51,52 --> 0:7:52,67
I wanted to go to the Bing.

Who wouldn't want to
go to the Bing?


193
0:7:54,4 --> 0:7:56,16
Not go into the Bing and use
its services, obviously,


194
0:7:56,16 --> 0:7:58,58
because I don't need a happy
ending as we're speaking now.


195
0:7:58,58 --> 0:8:1,888

0:8:11,97 --> 0:8:14,28
even the local police.


201
0:8:14,28 --> 0:8:17,51
MALE SPEAKER 2: So that's
three pull-overs in


202
0:8:17,51 --> 0:8:18,8
literally one hour.


203
0:8:18,8 --> 0:8:21,932
And every time you've
gotten out of it.


204
0:8:21,932 --> 0:8:23,34
CHRIS HARRIS: There's something
to be said for


205
0:8:23,34 --> 0:8:24,595
mooching and posing in them.


206
0:8:24,595 --> 0:8:27,7
Because they're not actually
that good on the open road.


207
0:8:27,7 --> 0:8:28,22
I tell a lie.


208
0:8:28,22 --> 0:8:29,78
That's unfair on the ZL.


209
0:8:29,78 --> 0:8:33,32
The GT500 skips over bumps, the
power delivery is pretty


210
0:8:33,32 --> 0:8:35,63
savage, and the exhaust
noise is grating.


211
0:8:35,63 --> 0:8:37,69
The ZL is much more composed.


212
0:8:37,69 --> 0:8:40,23
In fact, it's just a nicer
fast road car--


213
0:8:40,23 --> 0:8:42,69
quieter and easier.


214
0:8:42,69 --> 0:8:47,48
But do you buy muscle to
be easier and quieter?


215
0:8:47,48 --> 0:8:48,67
I don't know.


216
0:8:48,67 --> 0:8:51,5
Let's go to the track and wreck
some tires before we


217
0:8:51,5 --> 0:8:52,33
even attempt to answer
that one.


218
0:8:52,33 --> 0:8:56,0



219
0:8:56,0 --> 0:8:58,786
OK, we're at Monticello Motor
Club now and finally have the


220
0:8:58,786 --> 0:9:1,47
chance to use some of this
massive amount of horsepower.


221
0:9:1,47 --> 0:9:6,387
We're in the ZL1 first, the
weakest by some margin.


222
0:9:6,387 --> 0:9:9,7
How often do you say that of a
car that has 580 horsepower?


223
0:9:9,7 --> 0:9:11,49
This is quite a heavy
brute though--


224
0:9:11,49 --> 0:9:14,61
1,860 kilograms.


225
0:9:14,61 --> 0:9:18,73
So I don't expect, given that
it's about 85 degrees outside,


226
0:9:18,73 --> 0:9:20,2
to be able to pound around
for too long.


227
0:9:20,2 --> 0:9:21,8
So let's go and do a couple
of laps and just


228
0:9:21,8 --> 0:9:23,655
see how the car behaves.


229
0:9:23,655 --> 0:9:28,322
And for me as a European, I have
to say, people like me


230
0:9:28,322 --> 0:9:30,7
have quite a jaundiced view of
these American performance


231
0:9:30,7 --> 0:9:34,115
cars-- too big, too heavy,
and not really on a


232
0:9:34,115 --> 0:9:35,2
par with the Europeans.


233
0:9:35,2 --> 0:9:36,973
But these are quite serious
performance cars.


234
0:9:36,973 --> 0:9:39,416
They've got a lot
of performance.


235
0:9:39,416 --> 0:9:43,9



236
0:9:43,9 --> 0:9:44,36
Motor's great.


237
0:9:44,36 --> 0:9:47,84
But it doesn't feel like
it's got 580 to me.


238
0:9:47,84 --> 0:9:49,65
Maybe that's because
it is so heavy.


239
0:9:49,65 --> 0:9:52,856
Brake pedal-- a little
bit blunt.


240
0:9:52,856 --> 0:9:56,42
To me, feels like sort of M3
performance and a bit.


241
0:9:56,42 --> 0:9:58,11
I've got the safety systems
on at the moment.


242
0:9:58,11 --> 0:10:1,2
And it's really working
hard at the back axle.


243
0:10:1,2 --> 0:10:4,75
We have got oversteer whenever
we want it, boys.


244
0:10:4,75 --> 0:10:7,52
Bodes well for [INAUDIBLE].


245
0:10:7,52 --> 0:10:9,31
Do you know what?


246
0:10:9,31 --> 0:10:13,18
As a European, this does not
feel at all bad, this thing.


247
0:10:13,18 --> 0:10:15,2
It's not the last word.


248
0:10:15,2 --> 0:10:16,59
But it's pretty good.


249
0:10:16,59 --> 0:10:17,983
It's really pretty good.


250
0:10:17,983 --> 0:10:20,7



251
0:10:20,7 --> 0:10:23,2
I have to say, initial
thoughts--


252
0:10:23,2 --> 0:10:25,55
this car has hugely benefited
from having an


253
0:10:25,55 --> 0:10:26,57
independent rear end.


254
0:10:26,57 --> 0:10:28,92
It doesn't feel like the most
sophisticated rear end.


255
0:10:28,92 --> 0:10:30,135
But it does feel--


256
0:10:30,135 --> 0:10:33,67
well, I know it goes over
bumps in the middle of a


257
0:10:33,67 --> 0:10:35,7
corner and doesn't get
spat sideways.


258
0:10:35,7 --> 0:10:40,36
And the chassis is not being
completely overpowered by this


259
0:10:40,36 --> 0:10:43,425
engine, not by a long
shot actually.


260
0:10:43,425 --> 0:10:45,86
It feels like quite a nice
balanced package.


261
0:10:45,86 --> 0:10:53,165



262
0:10:53,165 --> 0:10:53,652
Yes.


263
0:10:53,652 --> 0:10:54,986
Now we can let it move
around a bit.


264
0:10:54,986 --> 0:10:57,7



265
0:10:57,7 --> 0:11:0,9
But its advantage over the Ford
is it's got 305 section


266
0:11:0,9 --> 0:11:3,79
rear tire-- so less power,
more mechanical grip.


267
0:11:3,79 --> 0:11:6,901
It's quite a useful
recipe, isn't it?


268
0:11:6,901 --> 0:11:7,378
I'm going full power here.


269
0:11:7,378 --> 0:11:8,628
I can't make the thing drift.


270
0:11:8,628 --> 0:11:13,59



271
0:11:13,59 --> 0:11:16,1
A surprising, slightly strange
car we have here, Thomas.


272
0:11:16,1 --> 0:11:22,55



273
0:11:22,55 --> 0:11:24,348
I'm properly trying to back
it in, but it won't do it.


274
0:11:24,348 --> 0:11:27,31
Maybe the ambient temperature
isn't helping the old girl.


275
0:11:27,31 --> 0:11:40,67



276
0:11:40,67 --> 0:11:41,68
Here's a good question
to ask yourself


277
0:11:41,68 --> 0:11:43,17
on a Thursday afternoon.


278
0:11:43,17 --> 0:11:50,2
What does 671 horsepower within
a body weighing 1,747


279
0:11:50,2 --> 0:11:52,79
kilograms feel like when
it's transmitted to the


280
0:11:52,79 --> 0:11:54,9
road via a live axle?


281
0:11:54,9 --> 0:11:57,85



282
0:11:57,85 --> 0:12:0,12
Welcome to the GT500.


283
0:12:0,12 --> 0:12:4,7
I'm leaving all the systems
on to start with.


284
0:12:4,7 --> 0:12:4,72
First thing's first.


285
0:12:4,72 --> 0:12:5,47
This seat--


286
0:12:5,47 --> 0:12:6,742
I'm sitting too high.


287
0:12:6,742 --> 0:12:9,747
I've already got traction issues
and I've just used


288
0:12:9,747 --> 0:12:10,997
about a third of throttle.


289
0:12:10,997 --> 0:12:13,421



290
0:12:13,421 --> 0:12:15,29
Yeah, this is going to be a
handful, this thing, isn't it?


291
0:12:15,29 --> 0:12:17,51
What an engine.


292
0:12:17,51 --> 0:12:23,39
So much more powerful than
the Camaro engine.


293
0:12:23,39 --> 0:12:26,52
Yeah, this car is dominated
by its motor.


294
0:12:26,52 --> 0:12:29,84
It's an engine looking
for a chassis.


295
0:12:29,84 --> 0:12:31,45
I'm not convinced it's
found it in this


296
0:12:31,45 --> 0:12:32,7
particular car, either.


297
0:12:32,7 --> 0:12:36,583



298
0:12:36,583 --> 0:12:41,3
Now we caught them-- but the
axle is absolutely having a


299
0:12:41,3 --> 0:12:45,2
massive tantrum with itself.


300
0:12:45,2 --> 0:12:48,28
God, it just feels so much
faster in a straight line.


301
0:12:48,28 --> 0:12:49,38
Braking--


302
0:12:49,38 --> 0:12:50,57
OK.


303
0:12:50,57 --> 0:12:54,8
Has it got a spool diff
on it or something?


304
0:12:54,8 --> 0:12:56,23
It feels like a drift car.


305
0:12:56,23 --> 0:12:57,93
I think it's extraordinary,
absolutely extraordinary.


306
0:12:57,93 --> 0:13:2,27
And anyone from my continent
that sniffs at it not being as


307
0:13:2,27 --> 0:13:5,83
dignified as an M3 can saw it
off, because this is properly


308
0:13:5,83 --> 0:13:10,582
exciting, this thing,
properly exciting.


309
0:13:10,582 --> 0:13:13,468
The engine just keeps going.


310
0:13:13,468 --> 0:13:17,23
And rarely has a car said to me,
as clearly and as loudly,


311
0:13:17,23 --> 0:13:18,97
please turn the traction
control off.


312
0:13:18,97 --> 0:13:21,62
Please turn the traction
control off.


313
0:13:21,62 --> 0:13:25,6



314
0:13:25,6 --> 0:13:29,82
This is a factory car--


315
0:13:29,82 --> 0:13:31,75
670 horsepower.


316
0:13:31,75 --> 0:13:33,385
It's not some tuner nonsense.


317
0:13:33,385 --> 0:13:36,808
This comes with a warranty.


318
0:13:36,808 --> 0:13:38,776
I do like it.


319
0:13:38,776 --> 0:13:39,76
I do like it.


320
0:13:39,76 --> 0:13:41,38
It's crude and it's--


321
0:13:41,38 --> 0:13:42,74
but you know what?


322
0:13:42,74 --> 0:13:46,43
For all that crudity, it's just
much more exciting and


323
0:13:46,43 --> 0:13:49,64
much faster than the Camaro.


324
0:13:49,64 --> 0:13:52,8
Where there's no bumps, the live
axle isn't as much of a


325
0:13:52,8 --> 0:13:54,7
problem as you'd expect.


326
0:13:54,7 --> 0:13:59,28
But when there are bumps,
it's not ideal.


327
0:13:59,28 --> 0:14:0,82
There.


328
0:14:0,82 --> 0:14:4,3
It's making me wait an eternity
to get on the gas.


329
0:14:4,3 --> 0:14:6,69
It's so much fun though.


330
0:14:6,69 --> 0:14:17,52
And it's the same price
as a loaded up 325i.


331
0:14:17,52 --> 0:14:19,98
These are actually quite
different cars.


332
0:14:19,98 --> 0:14:21,83
The Ford is lighter,
more powerful,


333
0:14:21,83 --> 0:14:23,6
and generally crazier.


334
0:14:23,6 --> 0:14:26,533
The Camaro is much
more rounded.


335
0:14:26,533 --> 0:14:29,63
In as much as I could imagine
living with it every day the


336
0:14:29,63 --> 0:14:33,18
way I could, say, an Audi RS
or an AMG Mercedes, how you


337
0:14:33,18 --> 0:14:36,27
judge them clearly depends
on your Chevy or Ford


338
0:14:36,27 --> 0:14:37,36
affiliation.


339
0:14:37,36 --> 0:14:39,97
But once you've chosen your
tattoo, it actually comes down


340
0:14:39,97 --> 0:14:43,2
to what you expect from
a modern muscle car.


341
0:14:43,2 --> 0:14:45,5
Because I'm a limey not
regularly exposed to this


342
0:14:45,5 --> 0:14:49,23
stuff, I wanted to rip my arms
off and scare my children.


343
0:14:49,23 --> 0:14:51,8
And the ZL doesn't do that.


344
0:14:51,8 --> 0:14:53,28
It's too good for that.


345
0:14:53,28 --> 0:14:56,65
Despite giving away power and
weight, it was two seconds


346
0:14:56,65 --> 0:14:59,3
faster around Monticello
in my hands.


347
0:14:59,3 --> 0:15:2,53
But in the land of muscle,
bad is good.


348
0:15:2,53 --> 0:15:5,637
And the GT500 is the
baddest of all.


349
0:15:5,637 --> 0:15:9,613
Now how do I import one
to the UK again?


350
0:15:9,613 --> 0:17:9,613
