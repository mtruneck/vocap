CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: I`m Carl Azuz. Today,
on CNN STUDENT NEWS we begin by continuing


2
0:0:18,7 --> 0:0:21,93
our coverage of the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.
And we are looking at the way to help those


3
0:0:21,93 --> 0:0:25,9
affected by this tragedy begin to heal.


4
0:0:25,9 --> 0:0:30,619
A healing process will be a long one for many
people in Newtown. But slowly, some of the


5
0:0:30,619 --> 0:0:36,1
first signs of normalcy are returning. Students
started going back to school yesterday. Teacher


6
0:0:36,1 --> 0:0:40,829
groups said the classes would discuss the
shooting in age-appropriate ways trying to


7
0:0:40,829 --> 0:0:45,73
help students make sense of it. Class was
not back in session of the students and teachers


8
0:0:45,73 --> 0:0:50,15
of Sandy Hook Elementary. They won`t go back
until January, and when they do, they`ll be


9
0:0:50,15 --> 0:0:54,549
at a different building about eight miles
away. On Monday, we covered the shooting in


10
0:0:54,549 --> 0:0:59,589
depth. You can find that show on our home
page or at the CNN schools of thought blog.


11
0:0:59,589 --> 0:1:4,14
Teachers, that`s also where you`ll find the
post that shares some tools to help discuss


12
0:1:4,14 --> 0:1:9,27
the story with your students. Gary Tuchman
now looks at how some specially trained animals


13
0:1:9,27 --> 0:1:10,72
are taking part of the healing process.


14
0:1:10,72 --> 0:1:11,22
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


15
0:1:11,22 --> 0:1:16,11
GARY TUCHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Nine golden
retrievers on the march making their way into


16
0:1:16,11 --> 0:1:21,74
a recreation center in Newtown, Connecticut
for an emotional rescue to help comfort the


17
0:1:21,74 --> 0:1:26,97
children who survived the attack at Sandy
Hook Elementary and other children in town.


18
0:1:26,97 --> 0:1:32,11
Therapeutic canines were sponsored and trained
by Lutheran Church Charities transported in


19
0:1:32,11 --> 0:1:34,65
a van for a 900 mile ride from Illinois.


20
0:1:34,65 --> 0:1:36,5
(on camera): And what is a comfort dog?


21
0:1:36,5 --> 0:1:39,52
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A comfort dog is one who
brings comfort to other people when they are


22
0:1:39,52 --> 0:1:44,86
suffering or hurting or bring happiness to
people, it helps people process the grief


23
0:1:44,86 --> 0:1:44,94
they ...


24
0:1:44,94 --> 0:1:45,87
TUCHMAN: So they are specially trained?


25
0:1:45,87 --> 0:1:49,32
TIM HETZNER, LUTHERAN CHURCH CHARITIES: They
are specially trained. These are all trained


26
0:1:49,32 --> 0:1:53,39
service dogs. So we don`t use them with disabled,
but we use that training, and then we train


27
0:1:53,39 --> 0:1:57,35
them additionally to work with all different
age groups and people.


28
0:1:57,35 --> 0:2:3,81
To some people, and we`ve seen this with children,
it brings a sense of calmness in the time


29
0:2:3,81 --> 0:2:8,92
of confusion for them during this period.
To some, it helps them process their grief,


30
0:2:8,92 --> 0:2:16,56
so they are crying, and they hug the dog and
to some children now come up, and they walk


31
0:2:16,56 --> 0:2:17,9
away happy.


32
0:2:17,9 --> 0:2:21,84
Do you know that Luther is incapable of being
mean? Luther is a friendly dog.


33
0:2:21,84 --> 0:2:23,55
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, Katon loves dogs.


34
0:2:23,55 --> 0:2:26,6
TUCHMAN: When does training begin to be a
comfort dog?


35
0:2:26,6 --> 0:2:31,17
HETZNER: Five and a half weeks, we buy puppies
at five and a half weeks and turn them upside


36
0:2:31,17 --> 0:2:34,48
down in how their temperament is and from
that point on, we ...


37
0:2:34,48 --> 0:2:38,7
TUCHMAN: But you turn them upside down, so
if they are turned upside down and they flail,


38
0:2:38,7 --> 0:2:40,44
they can`t be a comfort dog.


39
0:2:40,44 --> 0:2:45,89
HETZNER: Right. Our initial screening is if
they can be relaxed in that position, then


40
0:2:45,89 --> 0:2:50,83
we start the next process, which is a trainer
that works with them one on one for the next


41
0:2:50,83 --> 0:2:52,11
eight months to a year.


42
0:2:52,11 --> 0:2:52,59
(END VIDEOTAPE)


43
0:2:52,59 --> 0:2:56,84
AZUZ: We`ve been asking on our blog, what
you think can be done to keep kids safer at


44
0:2:56,84 --> 0:3:1,25
school. Amira says, "Schools should have more
security guards with better training and more


45
0:3:1,25 --> 0:3:6,489
available defense resources for the trained
security personnel." Ian suggests, "Limiting


46
0:3:6,489 --> 0:3:11,36
access points for perpetrators and educating
students on what needs to be done in case


47
0:3:11,36 --> 0:3:16,28
the worst happens." From Kal, campuses could
be surrounded by fences that can be climbed


48
0:3:16,28 --> 0:3:18,629
as easily as chain-linked fences.


49
0:3:18,629 --> 0:3:23,14
Jack thinks the best course of action is to
have at least to or more staff in a school


50
0:3:23,14 --> 0:3:26,61
with guns to protect themselves and the kids.


51
0:3:26,61 --> 0:3:31,12
John writes, "The only reasonable solution
is to have stricter gun control: not a single


52
0:3:31,12 --> 0:3:36,23
American needs an automatic weapon unless
it`s government issued." Macey says, "Too


53
0:3:36,23 --> 0:3:40,89
many people have guns and use them for the
wrong reason." In Nick`s opinion, a change


54
0:3:40,89 --> 0:3:46,59
in gun laws wouldn`t solve the problem: "We
need to focus on mental instabilities in children."


55
0:3:46,59 --> 0:3:50,81
Heather also says, "We need more attention
brought to mental health care to prevent things


56
0:3:50,81 --> 0:3:55,75
like this from happening. CNN is looking for
your "I- Reports." If your class or school


57
0:3:55,75 --> 0:4:1,61
is taking action to honor Newtown, Connecticut,
head to ireport.com and upload your photos


58
0:4:1,61 --> 0:4:3,5
in our Newtown assignment.

60
0:4:4,89 --> 0:4:13,42
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? There
are mountains on the Moon. Yes, the Moon has


61
0:4:13,42 --> 0:4:18,789
mountains, craters, even seas, although scientists
don`t think there`s water in them.


62
0:4:18,789 --> 0:4:21,39
(END VIDEO CLIP)


63
0:4:21,39 --> 0:4:27,419
AZUZ: One of these mountains is named for
Sally Ride, the first American woman in space,


64
0:4:27,419 --> 0:4:33,21
and on Monday, that spot was the final stop
for a pair of probes, a pair of spacecraft


65
0:4:33,21 --> 0:4:38,72
that have been checking out the Moon. Ebb
and Flow were about the size of a washer and


66
0:4:38,72 --> 0:4:43,1
dryer, before they crashed landing into that
mountain, their mission was to orbit the Moon


67
0:4:43,1 --> 0:4:47,5
and map it out. Scientists were hoping to
learn more about its surface and how it might


68
0:4:47,5 --> 0:4:51,88
have formed. Researchers say they got a lot
of great information from Ebb and Flow. They


69
0:4:51,88 --> 0:4:56,28
think it could take years to analyze all of
it. NASA officials say the twin probes were


70
0:4:56,28 --> 0:5:1,53
intentionally sent into that mountain on Monday
because they didn`t have enough fuel or altitude


71
0:5:1,53 --> 0:5:3,22
to keep going with the mission.


72
0:5:3,22 --> 0:5:8,11
The group of men you are seeing here are part
of a TV crew for NBC. One of them is Richard


73
0:5:8,11 --> 0:5:13,8
Engel, the network`s chief foreign correspondent.
The crew was kidnapped by masked armed men


74
0:5:13,8 --> 0:5:18,91
when it crossed the border into Syria to report
on that country`s civil war. During the five


75
0:5:18,91 --> 0:5:23,41
days they were held, Engel said the crew was
blindfolded and repeatedly threatened. They


76
0:5:23,41 --> 0:5:29,11
were eventually freed and taken out of Syria
on Tuesday. And it`s been difficult for journalists


77
0:5:29,11 --> 0:5:34,2
to report on Syria`s civil war, because the
Syrian government has severely limited their


78
0:5:34,2 --> 0:5:39,18
access inside the country. When journalists
do choose to report from inside Syria, they


79
0:5:39,18 --> 0:5:41,8
are potentially putting themselves in harm`s
way.

81
0:5:43,9 --> 0:5:47,86
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Mr. Linser`s classes at Bellevue High


82
0:5:47,86 --> 0:5:53,16
School in Bellevue Washington. Which of these
ancient civilizations leave in what`s now


83
0:5:53,16 --> 0:6:0,33
North and Central America? Here we go, was
it the Sumarians, Phoenicians, Maya or Vikings?


84
0:6:0,33 --> 0:6:6,57
You`ve got three seconds, go!


85
0:6:6,57 --> 0:6:14,99
They Maya lives in parts of what are now Belize,
Guatemala and Mexico. That`s your answer and


86
0:6:14,99 --> 0:6:17,2
that`s your "Shoutout."


87
0:6:17,2 --> 0:6:19,6
(END VIDEO CLIP)


88
0:6:19,6 --> 0:6:24,2
AZUZ: You might have studies the Maya in your
history classes, you might have even discussed


89
0:6:24,2 --> 0:6:27,59
them outside of school, there is this rumor
that`s been going around about the end of


90
0:6:27,59 --> 0:6:32,11
the world. Now, the theory says that could
happen later on this week, because that is


91
0:6:32,11 --> 0:6:37,18
when the Mayan calendar ends, but Nick Parker
caught up with some modern day Maya about


92
0:6:37,18 --> 0:6:37,8
the reality.


93
0:6:37,8 --> 0:6:38,509
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


94
0:6:38,509 --> 0:6:43,57
NICK PARKER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lario Kancha
(ph) is a priest, his people`s calendar ends


95
0:6:43,57 --> 0:6:46,289
in a matter of days.


96
0:6:46,289 --> 0:6:50,55
"It`s considered the closure of the great
cycle of Mayan time," he says. But, of course,


97
0:6:50,55 --> 0:6:54,5
the next cycle begins the following day. For
the Mayans, it`s not the end of the world.


98
0:6:54,5 --> 0:6:55,93
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We can`t get to the airport.


99
0:6:55,93 --> 0:7:1,83
PARKER: Doomsday scenes from movies like "2012"
have helped create a different myth. So, where


100
0:7:1,83 --> 0:7:7,59
does it come from? The Mayan civilization
began in several countries from around 2,000


101
0:7:7,59 --> 0:7:14,5
B.C. The story behind the infamous date begins
in ancient sites like Chichen Itza where Mayans


102
0:7:14,5 --> 0:7:14,83
created calendars.


103
0:7:14,83 --> 0:7:19,83
ALFREDO BARRERA, MEXIAN GOVERNMENT ARCHEOLOGIST:
The Mayas were astronomers, when they go into


104
0:7:19,83 --> 0:7:26,6
the tower in the upper part, they can make
observations, they relate the astronomic records


105
0:7:26,6 --> 0:7:29,74
with the agriculture, with the economy.


106
0:7:29,74 --> 0:7:35,569
PARKER: Temples are designed to channel sunlight,
and the number of panels correspond to years.


107
0:7:35,569 --> 0:7:40,25
When academics translated inscriptions in
the 19th century, they discovered that Mayans


108
0:7:40,25 --> 0:7:47,87
counted 394 years cycles, known as baktuns
and many say the significant 14th baktun expires


109
0:7:47,87 --> 0:7:55,18
this Winter Solstice, December, the 21st.
Others say, it actually ends on the 23rd.


110
0:7:55,18 --> 0:8:2,139
This carving made in 700 A.D. Ignited furious
debate. Monument Six, as it`s known, was discovered


111
0:8:2,139 --> 0:8:7,58
at the site of Tortuguero and predicts a major
event at the end of this 13th baktun.


112
0:8:7,58 --> 0:8:17,18
BARRERA: We don`t have prophecy or inscriptions
related with the finish of the world or prophecies,


113
0:8:17,18 --> 0:8:26,15
it`s only a mention of a data, but it doesn`t
mention more about, because description is


114
0:8:26,15 --> 0:8:26,729
not complete.


115
0:8:26,729 --> 0:8:32,25
PARKER: He blames online speculation and ignorant
writing for the Doomsday belief. But the data


116
0:8:32,25 --> 0:8:39,659
is certainly open to interpretation. Santiago
Pando lives outside Mexico City and is a filmmaker.


117
0:8:39,659 --> 0:8:43,93
"There is a big sun, which is going to align
with the other suns in others galaxies," he


118
0:8:43,93 --> 0:8:48,119
says. "This means, there will be an enormous
quantity of light, and this will give us a


119
0:8:48,119 --> 0:8:52,59
wider view of reality."


120
0:8:52,59 --> 0:8:57,79
Many in Mayan countries will mark the day
as a celebration, as others around the word


121
0:8:57,79 --> 0:9:2,279
fear something more sinister. Nick Parker,
CNN, Yucatan, Mexico.


122
0:9:2,279 --> 0:9:3,499
(END VIDEOTAPE)


123
0:9:3,499 --> 0:9:8,829
AZUZ: Some superstitious folks might think
it`s bad luck to let a black cat cross their


124
0:9:8,829 --> 0:9:14,759
path, but the students at this crosswalk probably
disagree with that, because this black cat


125
0:9:14,759 --> 0:9:19,679
seems to be all about safety. It`s name is
Sable, he is 15 years old, his owner says


126
0:9:19,679 --> 0:9:24,29
he makes it part of his daily routine to heat
the street right before the bell rings. The


127
0:9:24,29 --> 0:9:28,369
crossing guards think of him as part of a
team, he even has his own safety vest, and


128
0:9:28,369 --> 0:9:30,739
he doesn`t charge for his services.


129
0:9:30,739 --> 0:9:34,529
And maybe one day he`ll call the tab he`s
been running. For now, he just seems to have


130
0:9:34,529 --> 0:9:38,79
a vested interest in keeping the street safe
for the kitties. That`s all the time we have


131
0:9:38,79 --> 0:9:44,29
for today. We will hope to cross paths again
tomorrow when CNN STUDENT NEWS returns. Bye


132
0:9:44,29 --> 0:11:44,29
now.
