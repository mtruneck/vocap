###0 - Modest preemptive actions can obviate the need
###4 of more drastic actions at a later date.
###8 - You think that you've been taught things like confidence intervals
###11 in an elementary statistical course that would let you do this;
###15 but if you really studied carefully,
###17 you'd know that they don't let you do this.
###19 A really principled frequentist can't produce a probability distribution...
###23 - The conclusion we want to point out when we think about valuation
###26 is the fact that means are scarce. I alluded to this already that
###30 as finite beings we can't will our ends to be attained.
###33 - A statistical description of the government's net-of-interest surplus.
###38 - ...deflation, I think that yields could drop to say, less than 1%
###43 on the 10 years and less than 2% on the 30 years...
###47 - ...that would effectively be a takeover of monetary policy by the Congress. - Oh, hello!
###50 Daunting, right? Might even make you feel stupid.
###54 Perhaps it's no wonder then,
###56 while even with the ongoing economic failures across the world:
###59 inequality, increasing poverty, debt collapse,
###63 bank failures, unemployment rising,
###65 very few today seem to be able to understand,
###68 let alone discuss, modern economics,
###71 outside, of course, the delegation game
###73 where the only attempted solutions people know
###75 is the mere shifting around of the deck chairs on the Titanic,
###79 assuming some new politician, central bank policy, or corporate legislation
###84 is going to save the day.
###86 Some years back, after coming to the conclusion that our politicians,
###91 legislators, and established authorities just might be provably incompetent
###96 when it comes to the truly intelligent management of our society,
###100 I started to look for questions and answers on my own,
###105 asking those questions about things
###108 that many today either seem to take for granted, ignore or even worse,
###111 assume that they have no capacity or business investigating at all,
###115 since our credentialed authorities in control
###118 must be smarter, more informed.
###121 It's a sad staple of modern culture, you know,
###123 the old "Relax, turn on the TV, keep going into debt,
###127 and pump out a bunch of kids while you're at it,"
###129 but most importantly, keep showing up at those jobs
###132 which you have likely already fooled yourself into believing
###135 serve some legitimate social role.
###138 Remember, the 1% of the world that owns 40% of the planet's wealth
###142 did not get that way with you understanding how the world really works.
###147 Nevertheless, and such cynicism aside (I'm sorry),
###150 I decided that I needed to start again,
###153 if you will, and ask some fundamental questions
###155 about stuff most have simply written off and forgotten.
###158 If you were to take a poll today of our species, asking what truly are
###162 the most fundamental questions that pertain to human survival and prosperity,
###166 such as, I don't know, what really supports human life, how food grows,
###171 what energy is, what creates and reinforces good public health,
###175 what defines a useful or detrimental belief system,
###180 you can rest assured, that the vast majority would have more concrete answers
###184 about baseball statistics, fashion trends, sitcom plots, and religious scriptures.
###192 Not to demean the cultural pleasures and creativity of expression
###196 that creates enjoyment in this life,
###198 but we have a distortion of priority that has proven incredibly detrimental
###202 to the future of our sustainability on this planet,
###205 where the majority facing clear mounting problems
###208 not only doesn't understand what the root of such problems really are,
###213 they don't even know what questions to ask;
###216 and today, there is no greater destructive ignorance at hand,
###220 than the vastly delusional concept known as modern economics.
###225 It is in this fundamental context that I found the most interest.
###231 What is an economy?
###233 Where does its foundational premise come from?
###236 What are we relating to exactly?
###240 How is societal organization finding a benchmark for itself?
###244 Is there a benchmark? What are we doing?
###247 Why does the discussion of this subject appear to be so elitist
###250 in its vocabulary and orientation? Is it really that complicated?
###256 I became so tired of being called ignorant of the subject
###259 by self-proclaimed experts I've challenged,
###262 I decided to take it upon myself to read the entire
###265 macro-economics curriculum of Harvard University
###269 from the undergraduate to the PhD level,
###271 along with all the staples of influence: F.A. Hayek, John Maynard Keynes,
###275 Ludwig von Mises; and I'll tell you what, I'm really glad I did
###279 because I had some very poor judgments that needed correction,
###283 not so much regarding my views about economics,
###287 but that life is short, and I wasted an enormous,
###290 unforgivable amount of time reading this outdated,
###294 overly-intellectualized gibberish.
###296 [Glass Breaking] Ah, shit!
###299 Bob, would you take care of that please? The fuse panel.
###303 Be careful man, it's not... [Explosion][Bob screaming]
###307 As the following episode will detail,
###310 modern economics is not true economics at all.
###313 It's a mere ideological philosophy, built upon a series of presuppositions
###318 that have been given the illusion of permanence.
###321 There is absolutely no relationship to the scientific integrity
###325 of our knowledge of the environment built into this model.
###328 The monetary-market system of religious belief
###331 is at the core of the vast majority of ecological and social imbalance
###335 we see in the world today.
###337 Sadly, it is in the face of normality, so many look past it.
###343 We might begin to see that this principal notion and practice
###346 is truly a problem in society, and to me,
###349 it is at the heart of a culture in decline.
###382 Earth: Curious little ball of rock, gas and water, isn't it?
###386 Hard to believe this little bubble of chemical elements floating in space,
###390 basically powered by the sun, could give rise to our colorful,
###394 yet rather troubling super-monkey species,
###397 a species often appearing pretty serious in its interest to destroy its habitat,
###402 though I should say pretty serious in its interest to destroy itself.
###407 - What is democracy?
###410 - It's got something to do with young men killing each other, I believe.
###416 - Excuse me a second. Bob, what the hell was that?
###419 The cut away, it wasn't funny. It was just depressing.
###423 Couldn't you find some guy shooting a bottle rocket out of his ass or something?
###429 You know what our demographic is and the point of the show, right?
###433 Okay, well please.
###435 Anyway, perhaps our immaturity is just a phase,
###439 a tragically comedic rite of passage,
###441 no different than children that need to be burned
###444 by a hot stove in order to realize they shouldn't touch it,
###447 or what the physics behind it may be.
###449 Nevertheless, the history and characteristics of this little orb
###452 can be scientifically described with a good deal of accuracy:
###455 A couple of billion years old now, a composite of gas and dust
###458 that resulted mostly from a large chemical reaction long ago,
###462 likely an exploding star or supernova;
###465 and over millions of years this dust clustered into relatively big chunks of rock,
###470 a pronounced gravitational field emerged,
###472 our chemical elements were slowly reorganized,
###475 and conditions emerged to enable water and an atmosphere,
###479 which is what bred the first single-celled organisms;
###483 and so went the slow process of mutation
###486 into the very amusing circumstance we have today: us.
###491 Of course, you are free to believe whatever creation story you like:
###494 a rib from Adam, alien cross pollination, primordial ooze.
###499 At the end of the day, the utility of such knowledge is quite small.
###502 In fact, our little monkey brains
###505 might never have a complete picture of something so complex.
###508 Yet what we do know is that the universe is governed by laws,
###512 not moral or religious laws, but laws that were around
###515 long before we ever evolved a brain to understand them.
###519 Laws that very clearly point out that we either adapt to them
###523 and respect them, or we suffer the consequences.
###526 Such is the true face of God: the Laws of Nature.
###532 In many ways, the history of our universe
###534 is the history of our understanding of it,
###537 and we have come a long way as a species
###539 with respect to how we organize our lives around these rules.
###543 Likely the best example of this adaptation,
###545 or in many ways lack thereof, is how we think about economy,
###549 the foundation of our social survival.
###552 Many thousands of years ago, our super-monkey brethren
###555 began to discover how to engage nature.
###558 We went from being completely at the mercy of the habitat,
###561 gathering our food with some hunting,
###563 living and migrating around the natural seasonal regeneration,
###567 to an agricultural revolution, learning how to cultivate food,
###571 create ever [more] sophisticated tools to ease labor
###574 and in effect, learn how to mimic nature itself.
###578 In fact, this new awareness and ever-increasing understanding
###582 to harness the processes of nature to our advantage
###585 is what has led to the vast technological innovation we see today.
###589 If nature is doing something, odds are we can understand how
###592 through these dynamic scientific principles, from artificial intelligence today
###597 which works to emulate actual neurological processes,
###600 to molecular engineering which uses the atomic logic
###603 to manually recreate material objects.
###605 And now, ever-important blood shifting erectile dysfunction drugs,
###610 which if you have being watching TV recently,
###613 must be the most epidemic health crisis in the Western world today.
###617 Since this revolution, human society became less nomadic,
###620 slowly merging into cities,
###622 and systems of labor specialization began to rise
###626 along with means for exchange. Barter is a common example.
###630 You need some eggs? Maybe give some firewood you chopped up
###633 in exchange for the dairy farmer's work.
###635 Yet, such practices became cumbersome and impractical after a while;
###640 so the idea of using some rare fancy rocks,
###643 like gold and silver as a medium of exchange, eased these transactions
###647 through a system of pricing goods in terms of their relative value.
###651 This gave birth to what we know today as the adjustable price system
###656 which, through the public's aggregate patterns of exchange and production,
###660 creates a crude, yet semi-workable logic
###662 where the prices of goods reflect the balance of supply and demand,
###666 otherwise known as the market or market value. Let me explain.
###674 When you stumble into the mall and buy the 85th generation
###677 iPoop 4G mp3 colostomy-bag camera phone waffle maker,
###682 you are creating economic signal information that is used to calculate demand,
###687 local and regional preferences, and other resulting data
###690 in concert with the millions of other impulsive consumers
###694 who, having also likely bought the 84th generation
###697 just two months prior for twice the price,
###700 creates an aggregate flow of input data and feedback
###703 that allows for an ostensibly rational regulation of resource allocation,
###708 production, distribution, labor requirements, and of course
###711 price consensus in the market based on perceived supply and demand,
###716 not to mention the general data of how the marketing team
###719 can screw you over even more later on.
###721 This mechanism is partly what the ultimate high priest
###724 of our current economic religion, Adam Smith, was alluding to
###729 with his 'invisible hand' notion of causality in the free market.
###734 And in many ways he was on to something.
###736 It does work in a limited context and a crude way.
###739 In fact, in the 1920's an economist named Ludwig von Mises put forward
###744 the still high-standing claim that without the price mechanism
###748 economic calculation and rational resource allocation
###751 and general organization would be impossible.
###755 He called it 'The Economic Calculation Problem'.
###758 However things are much different today than they were 200 years ago
###761 when Adam Smith published his 'Wealth of Nations'
###764 or when Ludwig von Mises made his criticism of central planning.
###767 The fact is the argument has changed. The economic debate now is
###771 what is actually sustainable and progressive for the human species,
###774 not to mere mechanics of the movement of the money.
###777 While it is true the price system might allow
###780 for the basic calculation of supply & demand data,
###783 to help rationally allocate labor, preference, distribution and the like,
###787 it ignores the real operational factors
###790 that relate to true, efficient earthly management
###794 hence the true definition of economy
###796 which is: optimized efficiency on all levels.
###800 For instance, there is no consideration for optimum resource allocation
###804 based on the material's most efficient purpose.
###807 Rational allocation of resources is not rational
###810 if the most conducive use of those natural materials, scientifically,
###815 is not directly considered and brought into comparison. [REJECTED]
###818 There is no consideration for the organizational efficiency
###821 of technical production itself, and all you have to do is
###824 analyze the waste machine of globalization to see this insanity at work.
###830 There is also no consideration for regeneration needs or recycling protocols:
###834 a true requirement for responsible rational resource use on a finite planet,
###839 nor is there any true production or distribution efficiency
###843 in any optimized scientific sense
###845 as such a means is, as will be described more so in a moment,
###849 also counter to the inherent logic of the market system itself.
###854 These, coupled with many other serious parameters
###858 needed for a truly efficient economy, are simply ignored or, even worse,
###863 assumed to be inherent to the price mechanism's function
###867 when they clearly are not.
###871 You see, the price mechanism's concept of efficiency
###874 translates the subjective mass interaction of consumers
###877 into the narrow assessments of regional demand, production and distribution.
###881 It has nothing to do with how or why the methods of industry are what they are.
###885 Such factors are left up to the whim of the producers
###888 operating for profit alone, completely decoupling
###892 from the natural regulation of scientific principles of sustainability.
###896 Aww, man!
###901 You see, at the core of 'The Economic Calculation Problem'
###904 is really the argument that we are completely irrational,
###906 that we can't possibly be organized in a way that is structurally efficient;
###911 we are too insane, essentially.
###913 Therefore, we have to have a general economic anarchy
###916 to organize our society and there's no other way around it.
###920 (*Bullshit!*)
###921 Again, today is very different than it was prior, and a quick review
###925 of modern computer programming and systems engineering
###928 will tell you that not only can the algorithmic intelligence
###931 of our sensory and measurement technology today,
###935 coupled with synergistic computer calculation,
###938 orient all the previously existing factors taken into account
###942 by the price mechanism as we know it,
###944 the truly relevant yet missing factors for optimal efficiency
###948 and sustainability could be brought into the equation.
###951 This would be the making of a true economic calculation for industry,
###956 not the crude truncated data put forward by price alone.
###960 So, coming back to our household, the Earth,
###963 what is this thing really? It's a system, a system of symbiotic laws.
###969 At the core of all principles of sustainability
###971 is recognition of the largest order system we can find, for reference.
###975 The price mechanism on the other... [crash]
###979 Bob, what was that?
###982 Jesus Christ, Louie!
###985 Bob, why didn't you tell me Louie was here already?
###988 Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special guest here on Culture in Decline,
###990 our local logic guru, Louie-the-Logic Gremlin.
###994 Louie has a severe impatience for anything illogical, and he works to...
###999 OK. Bob, you've got to get the goddamn Demo-Publican back in his cage
###1002 or Louie is going to freak out... Oh, shit! Cut the camera!
###1010 Sorry about that ladies and gentlemen. As I mentioned,
###1013 Louie here gets a little frustrated when it comes to anything illogical
###1016 and the Demo-Publican is sort of his mortal enemy.
###1020 Anyway, Louie, since we have you here, I want to ask you a few questions.
###1023 Is the free market actually
###1026 a good basis for sustainability for the human species?
###1049 Well, what about infinite wants and human needs?
###1052 How do we calculate such complexity?
###1118 Thank you very much Louie, I appreciate that.
###1121 Well, there you have it, folks.
###1123 However, logic aside, opinions about our economic system range dramatically.
###1127 So, to gain some public consensus on the issue, we now go live
###1131 to our New York 'Culture In Decline' correspondent,
###1134 Big Scotty D, who is live on Wall Street.
###1137 Thank you, Peter. This is Scotty D, in front of the New York Stock Exchange.
###1141 Today we're here in New York City
###1143 just to try to talk to some people on the street and find out a little bit
###1147 about what's going on in the world perception of economics.
###1151 Culture In Decline: Man On the Street
###1154 Sir, do you want to talk about the economy?
###1157 Would you like to talk about the economy?
###1163 Would you like to talk about the economy?
###1166 I really suck at this,
###1168 but I don't think people want to talk about economy either.
###1176 However, there was one guy who was willing to talk to me.
###1179 - What do you feel is the definition of economics?
###1181 Standing here in front of Wall Street, I'm just curious.
###1184 What do you think economics is?
###1186 - Well, I would say that economics is, is really just
###1191 just based on money, the things that's going on,
###1194 you know, from over here by Wall Street.
###1199 It's just money that makes the system ...
###1205 generate throughout NY city and for everybody in the world.
###1210 But it's just mainly a money thing, which makes the world go round.
###1213 I know what you are thinking. You're thinking
###1215 "What is this guy talking about?!"
###1218 But in reality, he probably knows as much about economics
###1221 as I know about interviewing people on the street.
###1224 And, seems like most of us
###1226 really don't know what the economy is all about anyway.
###1229 Back to you, Peter. *Man On The Streets*
###1232 Is it me or have you noticed that
###1234 there is more for sale in the world than ever before,
###1237 and I'm not referring to goods in your local store.
###1240 Today, the market rational is that
###1243 everything is for sale and nothing is sacred.
###1246 Need some cash? Why don't you rent out your forehead to commercial advertising?
###1250 Or better yet, why don't you buy the life insurance policy
###1253 of your elderly neighbor, and when she dies
###1256 you can get nice payout? Yep, it's legal!
###1259 Or maybe it's the little things that make you happy.
###1261 So, rather than put that blow-up doll in your car
###1264 to use the car pool lane (hehehehe),
###1269 just buy it, like you can in Minneapolis.
###1272 Or maybe you have an itch to slaughter that endangered black rhino in Africa.
###1277 Well, you can. Costs you about $150,000,
###1280 but hey, it's there. '150,
###1283 boy, I can't wait to eat that rhino!'
###1285 Or more seriously, maybe your kids are not excelling well in school.
###1289 Well, the market has a solution. Pay them!
###1292 Pay them to read and get good grades, like they do in Dallas, Texas.
###1296 But perhaps that is overkill, because by the time they hit college age
###1300 most prestigious universities will look the other way for admission
###1303 once a nice hefty donation is made for that new library wing.
###1308 Want to serve your country, but are tired of all those
###1311 pesky UN war rules and poor pay?
###1314 Just join the growing legion of private military contractors
###1318 who are slowly replacing the US military in general.
###1321 Or how about love?
###1323 Need a date, but don't want to wade through all the fog?
###1326 Women will now go on dates with the highest bidder on some dating sites.
###1330 Forget chatting, just fork out a couple hundred bucks
###1333 to entice the woman of your choice to allow you to pay for her dinner.
###1336 I am sure it will be a long lasting relationship.
###1339 Or perhaps most important,
###1341 does your business need a law passed to secure profits?
###1344 Well, just hire a lobbyist to influence Congress!
###1347 As the prior episode of Culture In Decline denoted,
###1350 there is nothing in the political and legal spectrum
###1353 that is not clearly for sale.
###1355 In fact, why do you think the court system allows most offenses
###1358 to be cleared with monetary funds?
###1361 But even if you do something really bad and you are stuck in jail
###1365 don't fret, because in some cases
###1368 you can about pay 80 bucks a night for a nice upgrade
###1371 to a clean quiet jail cell in a nice area of the prison.
###1376 You name it, you can buy it, and nothing is sacred.
###1379 143 years after the passage of the 13th Amendment of the US Constitution
###1384 and 60 years after Article 4 of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights
###1389 banned slavery and the slave trade worldwide,
###1392 there are today more slaves than anytime in human history,
###1396 trafficking about 30 million for various profit schemes.
###1400 But, what about ethics, you might ask?
###1402 Well, what about it? Ethics and morality
###1405 continue to be redefined by the economic ethos of the day,
###1409 and when a Wall Street trader makes millions of dollars
###1412 betting against the currency and hence prosperity of another country,
###1416 I can assure you he is sleeping like a baby at night,
###1419 and why shouldn't he? He is simply doing what is rewarded
###1422 and reinforced by the economic system-at-large.
###1425 The market's inherent psychology
###1427 has nothing to do with anything except its own perpetuation.
###1431 When you hear politicians tell you that they are invading some poor country
###1435 to bring freedom and democracy,
###1437 you need to understand what those words really imply.
###1440 The freedom they bring is market freedom,
###1443 and the democracy that they bring is the democracy of purchasing power:
###1447 the freedom of using money for influence,
###1449 the freedom to, in fact, restrict the freedom of others.
###1454 However, let's get back to this technical stuff.
###1456 Putting aside the distortion of market rationale
###1459 that now puts everything for sale,
###1461 putting aside the false premise that the price mechanism
###1464 actually properly calculates the true attributes
###1467 of a sustainable and efficient economic practice,
###1470 and putting aside the basic value system disorder
###1474 radiating out of the overall basis of unfolding,
###1477 let's now take a little quiz. Welcome to modern Economics 101.
###1483 Question 1: If you lived on a planet
###1485 with finite resources and an expanding population,
###1488 would you encourage an economy based on the need for growth and consumption
###1492 to keep everything going?
###1494 Correct answer: No.
###1496 The fact that our economy literally requires constant consumption and growth
###1500 to keep GDP afloat and people employed
###1503 is the hallmark of not an economy, but an anti-economy.
###1508 Question 2: If you were a producer
###1511 would you make goods to be as durable and adaptable as possible
###1514 given the finite nature of resources
###1516 in an interest to maximize labor productivity?
###1519 Answer: Yes. Today it's the opposite,
###1522 and not only are all goods inferior the moment they are made
###1526 due to the cost-efficiency needs for corporations to remain competitive,
###1530 most companies also engage in what is called planned obsolescence
###1535 which deliberately reduces good quality to encourage repeat purchases
###1539 for more profit.
###1541 Question 3: If you were a socio-economic planner,
###1544 would you encourage everyone to buy one of everything,
###1548 hoarding that personal property, protectively,
###1551 even though many goods are used infrequently?
###1554 Answer: No. That would be inefficient.
###1557 The reality that goods are only as relevant as their use would be realized
###1561 and hence a system of shared access,
###1564 not blind restrictive universal ownership,
###1567 would be the most rational manner of unfolding.
###1570 Question 4: What about incentive?
###1572 Would you push a cut-throat, competititve environment
###1575 where everyone it is out for themselves or their little group?
###1578 Correct answer: No. Knowing what we know today
###1582 about the competitive mentality and how it creates abuse,
###1585 along with the reality that collaboration and the sharing of information
###1589 is truly the driver of progress on the social level,
###1593 competition would be seen as the most limiting of arrangements
###1596 as a philosophical practice.
###1599 Question 5: What would be the basis for reward today?
###1602 Would you require every human to submit to each other for labor
###1606 as to achieve the means for survival?
###1608 No. That would be crude and counter-productive,
###1611 given the state of technology.
###1614 Modern technical capacity has the ability to increase productivity
###1618 beyond anything known in human history,
###1620 not to mention secure more safety and efficiency in general.
###1624 To push human labor for income
###1626 in the face of this tool for vast improvement is just absurd.
###1632 Final thoughts: If we were to take a step back and reflect upon
###1636 how our human family is behaving across the world today,
###1640 from Western materialism to Islamic extremism,
###1644 from nuclear war to necrophilia,
###1647 we are faced with a dark, yet extremely entertaining reality.
###1652 The very real fact [is] that we are monkeys in the wild,
###1656 barely out of the jungle on this planet
###1658 in the words of the late, great George Carlin,
###1661 inching out of the Dark Ages, in fact,
###1663 from a period of deep fear and confusion with respect to who we are,
###1668 what we are doing, how we relate to each other,
###1671 not to mention how we relate to the habitat that spawned us.
###1675 On one side of the spectrum we have a vast spectacle of human conceit:
###1679 stubborn ignorance, so much so that if you are like me,
###1683 sometimes you wonder why we should try at all.
###1686 That maybe this species deserves everything it gets
###1689 and its fate as an evolutionary cul-de-sac,
###1692 a failed genetic mutation, might be an ideal hope for this universe.
###1698 Cynicism aside however,
###1700 it's easy to see that there is a growing change in the minority
###1705 which will slowly become majority if we let it.
###1708 An awakening is happening, an awakening
###1710 where people have stopped imposing their traditional ideals
###1714 and various ideological baggage on the world,
###1716 and instead are starting to listen,
###1719 listening to what the tools of our ingenuity have afforded us,
###1723 listening to the message of nature itself.
###1727 If there is any context which needs a serious intervention
###1730 with respect to the natural laws that govern us,
###1732 if there is any context where we need to simply pay attention,
###1737 prepare to drop all of our prior assumptions and change accordingly,
###1741 it is in the economic context.
###1744 Economics is not just some arbitrary abstraction
###1747 for processing and distributing resources.
###1750 It is an underlying value molder that programs us into modes of behavior
###1755 that extend into all areas of our psychology.
###1758 It is the active global religion whether people like it or not,
###1762 and for those of us that wish to see reason triumph over dogma,
###1767 we have a long, long road ahead.
###1770 Advocates of the free-market model of economics will tell you
###1773 that there is no other system possible to calculate society,
###1777 that the competitive basis is the only way
###1780 to incentivize our primitive culture.
###1782 They will tell you that reduced economic interference of government
###1786 is the key to preserving the true integrity of the market economy
###1791 and also preserve our so-called liberty,
###1793 which they say would be quickly corrupted
###1796 as tyranny and oppression must occur
###1798 if any type of collaborative, designed economic practice was applied.
###1804 They talk of the 'true' free market:
###1806 a utopian ideal that claims the invisible hand,
###1810 if allowed to run without interference, would alleviate the poverty,
###1814 deprivation, abuse, corruption, conflict and inefficiency
###1818 so common in the world today.
###1821 Well, as with all religions, delusion is common,
###1825 because today the market is actually more free than ever
###1828 with the state being nothing more than a parent corporation
###1832 working to assist its commercial subsidiaries which support it.
###1837 Everything is for sale, and no one is accountable.
###1842 All natural laws and physical realities that would comprise the basis
###1847 for true technical earthly efficiency
###1850 and awareness and reasoning that, if allowed,
###1853 can literally transform the world into a place
###1856 with vast abundance and prosperity never before seen,
###1860 have been buried and dismissed,
###1863 only to be overshadowed by a certain kind of efficiency,
###1867 market efficiency, an efficiency that tracks money and money alone,
###1871 an efficiency that is literally decoupled
###1874 from everything that supports and secures life itself,
###1877 an efficiency that is circular in its reasoning
###1880 as it has no recognition of the physical laws of nature,
###1884 the laws of nature, which are, in fact, the only real true government
###1888 and regulatory system that has or will ever exist.
###1893 But then again, who is to say it matters?
###1896 Maybe we should all just take it in stride.
###1899 Maybe this reality show of humankind,
###1903 this satirical tragic parody of itself, to be sure,
###1906 doing all it knows, maybe this is the way it is
###1910 and our brains, our genes are messed up,
###1913 and we are just waiting for the final laugh track
###1915 when Spaceship Earth slams into that psychological brick wall.
###1921 I guess time will tell.
###1923 And until then, sit back, grab some popcorn
###1927 and keep watching the greatest reality show of all time.
###1930 And until next time, I am Peter Joseph,
###1933 an agent and victim of a Culture in Decline.
###1985 Would you like to talk about the economy?
