0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:10,49



2
0:0:10,49 --> 0:0:14,19
RAY BARBEE: I mean, to me,
honestly, I always looked at


3
0:0:14,19 --> 0:0:18,48
punk as more of a way of
thinking, if you will.


4
0:0:18,48 --> 0:0:21,89
It's kind of more that part of
you that's just like, man, I


5
0:0:21,89 --> 0:0:23,12
want to do this.


6
0:0:23,12 --> 0:0:24,15
This is the norm?


7
0:0:24,15 --> 0:0:25,62
I want to do that!


8
0:0:25,62 --> 0:0:31,64
If there's a heavy metal show
and then they book a jazz band


9
0:0:31,64 --> 0:0:34,94
in there, that's punk.


10
0:0:34,94 --> 0:0:36,6
PATRICK O'DELL: Hi,
welcome back.


11
0:0:36,6 --> 0:0:40,1
This episode is about Ray
Barbee, who was actually the


12
0:0:40,1 --> 0:0:42,32
first pro board I ever had.


13
0:0:42,32 --> 0:0:44,93
I think, to me, he
looked different.


14
0:0:44,93 --> 0:0:46,72
He just looks cool
when he skates.


15
0:0:46,72 --> 0:0:50,2
And even back then, those old
videos, I remember when Ban


16
0:0:50,2 --> 0:0:53,45
This came out, seeing his
skating, and he would do a


17
0:0:53,45 --> 0:0:55,96
bunch of no complies and
then a kick flip.


18
0:0:55,96 --> 0:0:56,96
And I'd think, like, wow!


19
0:0:56,96 --> 0:1:0,3
I can't believe he can do all
those tricks in a row.


20
0:1:0,3 --> 0:1:3,44
It doesn't take him 10 tries to
do each trick or whatever.


21
0:1:3,44 --> 0:1:5,87
And I sat down with Ray, and I
asked him a little bit about


22
0:1:5,87 --> 0:1:9,57
filming for those old
Powell videos.


23
0:1:9,57 --> 0:1:11,73
He's a really awesome skater.


24
0:1:11,73 --> 0:1:12,38
And this is it.


25
0:1:12,38 --> 0:1:13,75
The Ray Barbee episode.


26
0:1:13,75 --> 0:1:15,72
MALE SPEAKER 1: How long
have you been skating?


27
0:1:15,72 --> 0:1:17,13
RAY BARBEE: Six years.


28
0:1:17,13 --> 0:1:19,6
MALE SPEAKER 1: When
did you start?


29
0:1:19,6 --> 0:1:21,45
RAY BARBEE: Six years ago.


30
0:1:21,45 --> 0:1:25,1
When I first got into
skateboarding, again, it was


31
0:1:25,1 --> 0:1:26,73
in between sixth and
seventh grade.


32
0:1:26,73 --> 0:1:29,86
And I had a friend named Danny
that I always hung out with.


33
0:1:29,86 --> 0:1:32,29
We rode bikes together
all summer.


34
0:1:32,29 --> 0:1:34,96
And for his birthday he
got a skateboard.


35
0:1:34,96 --> 0:1:36,73
And it was just like, whoa!


36
0:1:36,73 --> 0:1:38,65
It made such an impression
on me.


37
0:1:38,65 --> 0:1:40,66
And he was riding that, and I
was riding my bike, and I was


38
0:1:40,66 --> 0:1:43,23
like, man, I want to
get a skateboard.


39
0:1:43,23 --> 0:1:44,65
He was like, well, my
dad used to skate.


40
0:1:44,65 --> 0:1:46,99
Let me see if he has his old
skateboard out in the garage.


41
0:1:46,99 --> 0:1:49,44
So, sure enough, we went in
the garage and found it.


42
0:1:49,44 --> 0:1:50,955
It was a Sims wood kick.


43
0:1:50,955 --> 0:1:52,84
It was like a '70s board.


44
0:1:52,84 --> 0:1:56,67
There was a group of guys that
were like, what did you guys


45
0:1:56,67 --> 0:1:57,86
do over the summer?


46
0:1:57,86 --> 0:1:59,5
And we were like, dude,
we skateboarded.


47
0:1:59,5 --> 0:1:59,71
They were like, you
skateboard?


48
0:1:59,71 --> 0:2:0,68
We skateboard, too.


49
0:2:0,68 --> 0:2:1,84
Come hang out with us.


50
0:2:1,84 --> 0:2:4,11
One of the guys, he had
a quarter pipe.


51
0:2:4,11 --> 0:2:6,8
We started off there just
learning tricks, like be in a


52
0:2:6,8 --> 0:2:10,515
line in the garage, hit it, come
back, get in line, and


53
0:2:10,515 --> 0:2:11,73
then do that.


54
0:2:11,73 --> 0:2:16,14
Because of the ramps then, it
was a lot of the vert pros


55
0:2:16,14 --> 0:2:17,34
that I would hear about.


56
0:2:17,34 --> 0:2:20,86
We knew that there was Caballero
in San Jose.


57
0:2:20,86 --> 0:2:24,6
And these were all the guys that
we were like, whoa, we


58
0:2:24,6 --> 0:2:24,9
want to be like--


59
0:2:24,9 --> 0:2:27,21
we want to rip like they do,
kind of thing, you know?


60
0:2:27,21 --> 0:2:30,32
And it was crazy, because back
then, it was so different.


61
0:2:30,32 --> 0:2:33,25
Nowadays kids are like,
give me a board, give


62
0:2:33,25 --> 0:2:35,12
me a sticker, whatever.


63
0:2:35,12 --> 0:2:36,23
We were just like, whoa.


64
0:2:36,23 --> 0:2:37,24
We didn't want to bug him.


65
0:2:37,24 --> 0:2:40,16
We were like, whoa!


66
0:2:40,16 --> 0:2:41,52
We didn't want to say
nothing to him.


67
0:2:41,52 --> 0:2:43,85
We were just like, let
him do this thing.


68
0:2:43,85 --> 0:2:45,2
PATRICK O'DELL: Was Public
Domain the first


69
0:2:45,2 --> 0:2:46,0
video you were in?


70
0:2:46,0 --> 0:2:47,76
RAY BARBEE: That was the
first video, yeah.


71
0:2:47,76 --> 0:2:48,48
Well, you know what?


72
0:2:48,48 --> 0:2:52,67
I was in Sick Boys, but Public
Domain was definitely the


73
0:2:52,67 --> 0:2:56,4
first featured thing
of me, for sure.


74
0:2:56,4 --> 0:2:58,6
Yeah, it was called the Rubber
Boys, that segment.


75
0:2:58,6 --> 0:3:0,4
And it was Steve Saiz,
Chet Thomas, and Eric


76
0:3:0,4 --> 0:3:2,43
Sanderson and myself.


77
0:3:2,43 --> 0:3:5,51
Because of, for us, street
was being so new,


78
0:3:5,51 --> 0:3:7,44
the list was blank.


79
0:3:7,44 --> 0:3:9,42
So for us, it was really
exciting because it was like,


80
0:3:9,42 --> 0:3:11,3
whoa, we can just
make up tricks.


81
0:3:11,3 --> 0:3:13,81
So we had a lot of fun just
kind of stumbling across


82
0:3:13,81 --> 0:3:15,1
things and making up tricks.


83
0:3:15,1 --> 0:3:21,53
And I think a lot of the stuff
that we stumbled on were


84
0:3:21,53 --> 0:3:23,2
things that people
had never seen.


85
0:3:23,2 --> 0:3:26,97
Because street skating, I almost
liken it to underground


86
0:3:26,97 --> 0:3:30,33
hip-hop or Indy music, where
it's like it's own culture.


87
0:3:30,33 --> 0:3:33,62
It's doing things, but
it takes something


88
0:3:33,62 --> 0:3:34,73
to bring it to light.


89
0:3:34,73 --> 0:3:37,18
But once that one thing gets
brought to light, people think


90
0:3:37,18 --> 0:3:38,44
that that's the first time.


91
0:3:38,44 --> 0:3:41,7
But it was happening for
so long in the--


92
0:3:41,7 --> 0:3:42,4
whatever you want to say.


93
0:3:42,4 --> 0:3:43,88
In its little culture and
in its little scene.


94
0:3:43,88 --> 0:3:46,31
It'd been going on for years,
but it was just a matter of it


95
0:3:46,31 --> 0:3:47,58
getting surfaced out.


96
0:3:47,58 --> 0:3:50,3
And that's when people always
link it to that, but it was


97
0:3:50,3 --> 0:3:52,34
going on for a while.


98
0:3:52,34 --> 0:3:55,53
PATRICK O'DELL: And what was the
process for filming then?


99
0:3:55,53 --> 0:3:58,6
It was just sort of like one
day just skating around?


100
0:3:58,6 --> 0:4:0,36
RAY BARBEE: Three days total
was that whole--


101
0:4:0,36 --> 0:4:2,4
all that footage
was three days.


102
0:4:2,4 --> 0:4:4,1
And it's funny because
Stacy wanted it to


103
0:4:4,1 --> 0:4:5,68
look like one day.


104
0:4:5,68 --> 0:4:7,89
So I remember, we'd skate--


105
0:4:7,89 --> 0:4:9,96
get going at 7:00 in the
morning, be done


106
0:4:9,96 --> 0:4:12,1
at 8:00 at or whatever.


107
0:4:12,1 --> 0:4:14,68
And he'd want us to put on the
same clothes the next day.


108
0:4:14,68 --> 0:4:16,25
And we did that for three
days straight.


109
0:4:16,25 --> 0:4:19,149
Yeah, the same Levi's, and the
same shirt, and the same


110
0:4:19,149 --> 0:4:21,41
shoes, maybe switch
out the socks.


111
0:4:21,41 --> 0:4:24,12
PATRICK O'DELL: So then the
next video is Ban This?


112
0:4:24,12 --> 0:4:26,1
RAY BARBEE: Ban This was right
after Public Domain, yeah.


113
0:4:26,1 --> 0:4:27,34
PATRICK O'DELL: And I
remember in that one


114
0:4:27,34 --> 0:4:29,39
you had lots of lines.


115
0:4:29,39 --> 0:4:32,52
It would be like seven
tricks in a row.


116
0:4:32,52 --> 0:4:33,99
RAY BARBEE: Yeah.


117
0:4:33,99 --> 0:4:36,84
That was the first one
with my own part.


118
0:4:36,84 --> 0:4:38,69
PATRICK O'DELL: When you decided
what spots you were


119
0:4:38,69 --> 0:4:40,18
going to go to, did
you decide?


120
0:4:40,18 --> 0:4:41,19
Or did Stacy decide?


121
0:4:41,19 --> 0:4:42,86
RAY BARBEE: That's what
was cool for me.


122
0:4:42,86 --> 0:4:44,61
A lot of those spots were
like the first time


123
0:4:44,61 --> 0:4:45,71
I ever skated them.


124
0:4:45,71 --> 0:4:47,54
Because we'd just get with Stacy
and Stacy would just


125
0:4:47,54 --> 0:4:49,0
drive around and be like,
you want to skate that?


126
0:4:49,0 --> 0:4:50,45
And I'd be like, cool.


127
0:4:50,45 --> 0:4:51,74
PATRICK O'DELL: It looked like
some of the video was looking


128
0:4:51,74 --> 0:4:54,49
for scenery and not
so much like--


129
0:4:54,49 --> 0:4:57,96
RAY BARBEE: It was before the
days of where you'd find spots


130
0:4:57,96 --> 0:4:59,77
and film one thing.


131
0:4:59,77 --> 0:5:2,14
Back then, it was more like
let's just capture the feel of


132
0:5:2,14 --> 0:5:5,59
what it's like to just go
skating, go skating out in--


133
0:5:5,59 --> 0:5:10,8
so I could tell definitely
around Ban This time, Stacy


134
0:5:10,8 --> 0:5:13,16
was getting more of an idea of
what he wanted to do visually.


135
0:5:13,16 --> 0:5:15,595
So he would take me to spots,
and I would be like, OK, you


136
0:5:15,595 --> 0:5:16,7
just want we to skate on
the ground right here?


137
0:5:16,7 --> 0:5:17,25
And he's like, yeah.


138
0:5:17,25 --> 0:5:18,44
I'm like, OK.


139
0:5:18,44 --> 0:5:19,97
PATRICK O'DELL: Did you feel
like then a part was about,


140
0:5:19,97 --> 0:5:22,14
like you said, expressing
skating?


141
0:5:22,14 --> 0:5:22,91
Or did you ever feel--


142
0:5:22,91 --> 0:5:25,73
RAY BARBEE: It's hard to say
because it's always easy to


143
0:5:25,73 --> 0:5:29,41
see what it grew into, and then
look back, and then try


144
0:5:29,41 --> 0:5:32,17
to think did you feel like
you wished it would


145
0:5:32,17 --> 0:5:33,25
have been like this?


146
0:5:33,25 --> 0:5:35,17
But it was way before
any of that.


147
0:5:35,17 --> 0:5:36,58
So it was what it was.


148
0:5:36,58 --> 0:5:37,81
It was just being created.


149
0:5:37,81 --> 0:5:39,84
So there was no--


150
0:5:39,84 --> 0:5:43,7
the only goal was let's
just be on our boards.


151
0:5:43,7 --> 0:5:45,25
And, OK, you're documenting
it.


152
0:5:45,25 --> 0:5:49,42
But to me, the whole video
thing was so new.


153
0:5:49,42 --> 0:5:52,2
I didn't know what was going
to come of any of this.


154
0:5:52,2 --> 0:5:55,53
For street skating, back then,
there weren't too many parts.


155
0:5:55,53 --> 0:5:59,71
Again, it was such new
terrain, new area.


156
0:5:59,71 --> 0:6:1,4
I mean, I dig where it is now.


157
0:6:1,4 --> 0:6:3,15
There's a place for all of it.


158
0:6:3,15 --> 0:6:6,28
Because of the growth of it,
the reality is the way


159
0:6:6,28 --> 0:6:9,11
skateboarding got pushed, it
just got to a place to where


160
0:6:9,11 --> 0:6:11,25
you can't do that
in three days.


161
0:6:11,25 --> 0:6:13,895
There's just no way to
physically pull that off.


162
0:6:13,895 --> 0:6:17,1
It takes a long time because
of where it's got pushed.


163
0:6:17,1 --> 0:6:18,3
So that's great.


164
0:6:18,3 --> 0:6:20,22
Because everything's got
to get pushed, man.


165
0:6:20,22 --> 0:6:21,51
You can't stay still.


166
0:6:21,51 --> 0:6:22,585
Everything's got to keep moving


167
0:6:22,585 --> 0:6:23,835
and growing and growing.


168
0:6:23,835 --> 0:8:23,835
