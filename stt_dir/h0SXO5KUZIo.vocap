###1 MALE SPEAKER: Welcome, everybody,
###2 to yet another Authors@Google Talk.
###6 Today with us is best-selling New York Times author Peter
###10 Singer.
###12 He wrote a very important book on cyberwar.
###16 Our own Eric Schmidt says, "this is an essential read."
###21 My dear colleagues, I will repeat this for you.
###24 This is an essential read.
###28 So we do have copies of the book on sale.
###32 This is the way it looks like.
###35 Please go and buy the book, even if you've seen this talk.
###40 Peter is a great author in many respects.
###46 But what he did for cybersecurity and cyberwar
###50 for, in particular, is he expanded
###53 on a field that is growing.
###56 And that we know is becoming increasingly important not only
###61 from the infrastructure standpoint,
###64 but also for international relations.
###66 I'm going to let Peter actually take it from here.
###69 Thank you, Peter.
###70 
###75 PETER SINGER: Thank you for the kind introduction.
###77 So it's a little bit daunting to be
###80 talking on this topic at a company like this,
###83 because I remember the very first time
###85 that I ever saw a computer.
###88 My father took me to a science center down in North Carolina.
###93 And I got to see a Commodore, if you remember those.
###97 And I took a class on how to program,
###101 learning an entire new language for the sole purpose
###105 of making a smiley face out of the letter m that printed out
###111 on one of those old spool printers
###113 that you tore the perforated paper off the sides.
###115 Remember that?
###117 Now since then, the centrality of computers to my life,
###123 your life, the entire world, it's
###125 almost impossible to fathom.
###127 We live in a world where more than 40 trillion emails
###130 are sent every single year.
###134 The first website was made in 1991.
###137 Now, according to your own analytics,
###139 there's more than 30 trillion individual web pages out there.
###143 Moreover, the internet is not just
###145 about compiling and sharing information.
###148 It's also having impact out on the real world via the emerging
###152 Internet of Things.
###153 According to Cisco, we'll see more than 40 billion devices
###157 internet-enabled over the next five years,
###159 as everything from thermostats to cars to refrigerators
###164 to technologies literally not yet invented or imagined all
###168 come online and all start to carry
###169 on conversations without us.
###172 So in short, domains that range from communication to commerce
###177 to critical infrastructure to even conflict.
###180 98% of US military communications
###182 goes over the civilian-owned and operated internet.
###185 All of these spaces are dependent on it.
###188 So we're in an age of cyber dependency.
###190 But in the short history of the internet,
###193 I would argue that we've reached a critical turning point.
###198 And it's because while the positive side of cyberspace
###202 is rippling out, so too are the risks, the negative side.
###205 There's all sorts of ways you can illustrate this.
###207 You can illustrate it with the raw numbers.
###210 Every second, nine new pieces of malware are discovered.
###214 97% of Fortune 500 companies know that they've been hacked.
###219 And the other 3% have been, too, they just
###222 aren't willing to admit it to themselves.
###224 More than 100 governments have created some kind
###228 of cyber military command, some kind of military unit designed
###233 to fight and win wars in cyberspace and beyond.
###236 And indeed, the very first Pew poll to kick off 2014
###240 found that Americans are more afraid of a cyber attack
###244 than they are of North Korean nuclear weapons,
###247 Iranian nuclear weapons, the rise of China, Russia,
###251 or climate change.
###253 So these fears, they've coalesced
###255 into one of the most rapidly growing industries
###257 in the entire world.
###259 They've also driven a massive bureaucratic growth
###263 at the national governmental level
###265 not just in the United States.
###267 Just earlier today, France announced
###268 that it was spending another $2 billion
###270 in its military on cybersecurity issues and cyberwar.
###274 But also we see it at the state level.
###276 And even at the local level, where
###278 you see cities like Los Angeles, for example,
###280 creating cybersecurity centers.
###284 What all this together means is that for all the hope
###288 and promise of the new digital age,
###291 we also live in an era of cyber insecurity,
###295 if we're really being honest about it.
###297 And so before I go much further, it's
###299 at this point I'm going to try and do
###300 something that's a little bit counterintuitive,
###302 but will maybe help make that point about cyber insecurity.
###307 And a lot like the challenge of trying
###310 to write a book about cybersecurity
###312 and make it interesting, you also
###314 have the challenge of how do you give a talk about it
###316 and give visuals that make it interesting.
###319 So what I did-- and with Boris's help,
###322 hopefully it will play for us here
###323 --is I've assembled what I think are
###325 some of the best illustrations of cyberwar art,
###329 and some of the worst illustrations of it.
###331 And it's going to play in front of me.
###333 I'm not going to speak to it.
###333 It's just going to continue to flash for a couple reasons.
###336 One, to tell that story of cyber insecurity.
###340 But also because data has found that you're
###343 60% more likely to retain what I'm
###345 saying if you look at a picture.
###347 Even if the picture has nothing to do with what I'm saying,
###350 it's just the way us humans work.
###353 And that actually goes to a broader lesson
###354 that the book explores, and we'll talk about it later on.
###356 Which is that we're humans, we're strange, we're weird,
###359 but that's what drives all of these things.
###361 So let's pull back on all this and wrestle
###364 with the question of why a book on cybersecurity and cyberwar,
###369 and why now?
###371 There's two quotes that motivated
###374 me that basically encapsulate this.
###377 The first is from President Obama,
###379 who declared that cybersecurity risks pose quote,
###382 "The most serious economic and national security
###385 challenges of the 21st century."
###387 The second quote is from the former CIA director,
###390 who said quote, "Rarely has something been so important
###394 and so talked about with less and less clarity and less
###399 apparent understanding."
###401 And you can see, I really do want to talk to this one,
###404 but we'll keep moving on.
###406 So let's explore this gap.
###409 We see it in all sorts of fields.
###411 From the 70% of business executives--
###416 not 70% of CTOs, CSOs, CIOs --but 70%
###420 of business executives in general, in any industry, who
###424 have made a cybersecurity decision for their company
###427 despite the fact that no major MBA program teaches it
###431 as part of your normal business management
###433 training and responsibility.
###435 That same kind of gap in training
###437 happens at the schools we teach our diplomats, our lawyers,
###440 our journalists, our generals.
###443 Or anecdotes.
###445 And there's just an array of funny,
###448 but in a certain way sad, anecdotes that
###449 populate the book.
###450 From the opening of the book where a Pentagon official is
###453 telling us how important this all is,
###456 but he describes it as "this cyber stuff."
###459 When you can only call something stuff,
###461 but you know it's important, that's
###462 not a good place to be in.
###464 Or the former Secretary of Homeland Security,
###469 the agency that is ostensibly in charge of cybersecurity
###472 on the civilian side for the United States--
###474 who has actually now taken over as Chancellor of the university
###477 system out here in California --who proudly talked
###480 to us about the fact that she doesn't use email.
###484 And in fact hasn't used social media for over a decade.
###488 Not because she doesn't think it's secure,
###491 but because she just doesn't think it's useful.
###494 That same phenomena is happening on the Judicial Branch.
###498 Where, for example, a Supreme Court Justice
###501 talked about how they quote, "Hadn't yet
###503 gotten around to email."
###505 Now this is obviously worrisome to folks
###507 here working on the Gmail account.
###508 But there's a broader question of what
###510 does this mean for Justices that in the upcoming year
###513 are going to decide everything from maybe net neutrality
###516 questions to the legalities of some of the things
###518 that the NSA was doing when they just haven't yet gotten around
###521 to email.
###523 The cyber stuff problem is not just an American phenomenon.
###528 We saw the same thing in meetings
###530 with leaders in China, UAE, France, Great Britain.
###535 The Head of Cybersecurity in Australia
###539 had never heard of Tor, obviously
###542 a critical technology in this space.
###545 Now the result is that cybersecurity
###547 is as crucial to areas as intimate as your personal
###551 privacy, to the security of your bank account,
###555 to as weighty as the future of world politics itself.
###558 But it's been treated as an issue
###562 only for the "it" crowd, for the IT folks.
###567 In turn, the technical community that
###570 understands the workings of the software and the hardware
###575 hasn't dealt very well with the wetware,
###578 with the human side, and particularly
###580 the ripple effects of this into other worlds,
###583 be it policy, law, war, you name it.
###586 They've often looked at the world
###587 through a very specific lens and failed
###589 to appreciate some of the broader pictures out there.
###592 Now the dangers of this are diverse.
###594 Each of us, in whatever role we play in life,
###596 must make decisions about cybersecurity
###599 that shape the future of the world well
###601 beyond just the online world.
###603 But too often we do so without the proper tools.
###607 Basic terms and essential definitions
###611 that define both what's possible but also what's proper,
###617 what's right and wrong, are missed or even worse distorted.
###623 Past myth and future hype often weave together,
###627 obscuring what actually happened with where we really are now.
###631 And so the result is that some threats are overblown
###635 and overreacted to, and other threats are ignored.
###640 So for example, as someone who loves history,
###643 it absolutely pains me when I hear
###647 people-- and people who have done
###648 this range from senior government leaders
###651 like senators to generals to prominent news columnists
###654 --describe how we are in a parallel to the Cold War.
###658 Or as a cabinet official told me,
###660 that malware was "just like a WMD."
###664 And that's why we needed to approach it
###665 in the same kind of deterrence theory
###667 that we used in the Cold War.
###669 What these people fail to appreciate
###671 is the parallel to the Cold War is not
###673 the one they think they're making.
###676 If you understand both the historic side
###678 and the technical side, the best parallel to the Cold
###680 War-- actually, those early days we
###683 didn't understand well either the technology but even more so
###686 the political dynamics that it was driving, the period of time
###690 where we took the real life versions of Dr. Strangelove
###694 seriously.
###695 So as an illustration in the book,
###697 we explore the episode where the US Air Force actually
###701 had a serious plan to nuke the moon
###705 to show the Soviets that we could
###706 do interesting stuff in space, too.
###709 Those are not historic lessons we should be drawing in terms
###711 of the how-to's.
###712 But that's often what the discourse is.
###715 Let me go into some of the manifestations
###717 of this disconnect, and how they play out, and why they matter.
###722 One in particular is that we often lump things together
###726 that are unlike, simply because they involve zeros and ones.
###731 So take that idea of a cyber attack.
###734 General Alexander, who is simultaneously
###737 the commander of US military Cyber Command and double-hatted
###742 as the head of the NSA-- which there
###745 are some very interesting problems with that.
###748 But let's move beyond that.
###749 He testified to Congress, quote, "Every day,
###753 America's armed forces face millions of cyber attacks."
###758 But to get those numbers he was combining
###762 a variety of like and unlike things.
###765 He was combining everything from probes and address scans that
###769 never entered networks to unsuccessful attempts
###773 to get in that ranged from kids carrying out pranks to attempts
###777 at political protests to attempts to get in to carry out
###781 some kind of theft or active espionage.
###785 But none of those millions of attacks was what his listeners
###790 in Congress thought he was talking about,
###793 which was the so-called cyber-Pearl Harbor
###797 or cyber-9/11 that actually there's been over a half
###801 million media and government speech references to.
###805 And that's what his boss as Secretary of Defense
###807 was warning everyone about.
###809 Essentially what we're doing is that we're bundling together
###812 all of these activities simply because they involve software.
###816 Which would be a lot like bundling together
###818 the activities of a group of teenagers with firecrackers,
###823 a group of political protesters in the street with a smoke
###826 bomb, James Bond with his Walther PPK missile,
###830 a terrorist with a roadside bomb,
###833 and a Russian cruise missile, and saying these are all
###835 the same because they involve the chemistry of gunpowder.
###839 We've bundled them together on the digital side,
###841 because they all involve the internet.
###843 Or take the organizations.
###846 I had a senior US military official
###848 argue with me that Anonymous and Al Qaeda were the same thing.
###854 Now, however you come down on Anonymous-- and I'm actually,
###859 I guess far more empathetic towards them
###863 than what you'd expect from people coming from DC.
###866 But the bottom line is, wherever you come down on them,
###869 they have nothing to do with Al Qaeda in terms
###873 of their organization, their means, their ends,
###877 their causes-- basically the only thing they're related
###880 is they're both non-state actors that begin with the letter A.
###882 But that was the belief.
###884 Now these gaps in understanding, these disconnects
###887 of policy and reality, mean that we're not only seeing
###890 growing tension-- and we explore this
###892 in particular in meetings with US and Chinese officials
###895 who would be negotiating on core questions of cybersecurity.
###899 And yet, as an illustration, one State Department official
###904 going off to one of these negotiations actually
###906 asked us what an ISP was?
###909 Which to make that Cold War parallel,
###911 would be like going off to negotiate with the Soviets
###913 and not knowing what an ICBM is.
###915 But the point is, it's not only driving tension,
###918 it's leading to us being taken advantage of.
###921 And that can happen at the individual level
###925 when you get tricked to send your mom your bank account
###929 information because she's stuck in Thailand.
###931 You didn't know she was in Thailand,
###933 but gosh, you just need to help her out.
###935 To more serious illustrations of this.
###937 Like at the G-20 conference, the most important
###941 international conference of the year,
###943 diplomats were spearphished by-- they received an email that
###948 had a wonderful offer for them.
###950 It said, if you click this link you
###952 will be able to see nude photos of the French First Lady.
###957 And many of these senior diplomats clicked the link.
###959 And unfortunately they didn't get to see the nude photos,
###962 but they did download spyware onto their accounts.
###965 Again, senior government officials
###968 to being taken advantage of at the business
###970 organizational level.
###972 Either alternatively not doing enough to protect the business
###976 or hiring hucksters who offer 100% security
###984 with some kind of silver bullet solution.
###988 Or frankly, being taken advantage
###990 of at the national political level.
###991 Which is, I think, behind a number of the issues
###993 surrounding the current Snowden-NSA scandal.
###998 This can even happen to a president.
###999 Reportedly, Obama expressed his, quote,
###1002 "frustration that the complexity of the technology
###1005 was overwhelming policymakers."
###1008 Now, our inability to have a proper discussion on these
###1013 means that we see a distortion of threats.
###1018 And in turn, a misapplication of resources to face them.
###1022 Perhaps the best illustration of this is a number-- 31,300.
###1028 That's the number of news and academic journal articles
###1033 that have explored the phenomenon of cyberterrorism.
###1037 Zero.
###1039 That's the number of people that have actually
###1040 been hurt or killed by an actual incident of cyberterrorism.
###1045 In the book, we joke that in many ways
###1047 cyberterrorism is a lot like Discovery Channel's Shark
###1050 Week, where we obsess about the danger of sharks
###1053 even though you're 15,000 times more likely to be
###1055 hurt on your toilet.
###1057 Except the difference is that Jaws actually did get someone,
###1061 or the real world version of Jaws did get someone.
###1063 Whereas we've not seen this in reality yet
###1066 other than Die Hard 4.
###1068 Now let me be clear, I'm not saying
###1072 that terrorists don't use the internet.
###1076 And in the book we have several chapters
###1078 that explore terrorists' use of it, much of which
###1080 is like how the rest of us use it.
###1082 And I'm not saying that there is not interest in carrying out
###1085 acts of cyberterrorism, nor that there
###1088 wouldn't be impactful effects of them.
###1091 Indeed, our development of Stuxnet,
###1093 a cyber weapon that finally had physical powers, caused
###1097 physical damage to the world, is a great illustration of this.
###1099 But in turn, Stuxnet illustrates how an effective cyber attack
###1104 that is real and consequential is also quite difficult.
###1109 To put it a different way, when it comes to cyberterrorism Al
###1114 Qaeda would like to, but can't.
###1118 China could, but doesn't want to yet.
###1122 Now my point, rather, is that strategy--
###1126 whether it's at the national level, at the business level,
###1130 at the individual level, strategy
###1132 is about choices and priorities.
###1135 And so we need to weigh the centrality of what
###1138 we talk about, what we obsess about in our discussions
###1142 versus what are arguably not only very real, but more
###1147 consequential cyber threats out there.
###1150 It ranges from something that this organization
###1153 is very familiar with-- the massive campaign
###1156 of intellectual property theft that by most measures
###1161 you could judge to be the largest theft in all
###1164 of human history, that's ongoing right now.
###1168 And where is it coming from?
###1170 If this was a Harry Potter novel,
###1171 we would describe it as a large Asian power
###1173 that shall not be named.
###1175 To if we want to think about the national security
###1177 consequences-- not just looking at the consequences of that IP
###1181 theft and how it plays out, but look
###1183 beyond the sexy cyber-Pearl Harbor descriptions
###1187 and actually focus on how the military uses this technology
###1191 and wants to use it.
###1191 And what is the future of computer network operations
###1195 in actual campaigns of warfare?
###1197 To maybe moreso we should be paying attention
###1200 to the ripple effects, the secondary effects of all
###1203 these actions.
###1204 Because if we use the illustration of terrorism,
###1207 one of the things we've learned from 9/11
###1209 is it's not merely the attack itself,
###1212 but how we react to it that really
###1215 stakes its place in history.
###1217 And so I worry about some of these secondary effects
###1220 that are playing out, and particularly
###1222 how they are hammering away at that crucial value that
###1226 has basically underpinned the internet of trust.
###1230 And we can see that being damaged
###1231 by the massive campaigns of cyber crime out there.
###1234 Whether it's the IP theft to credit card, and like.
###1237 And that's affecting both trust that consumers and users have
###1241 with the network, and in turn what the operators have
###1244 towards consumers.
###1245 To trust damaged by our government's actions seeking
###1250 to deal with conventional terrorism.
###1254 And what that has done to both trust in those agencies,
###1258 but also trust in America and trust in American technology
###1261 companies.
###1262 To finally, what it's done to the internet freedom agenda.
###1266 And the trust in the underlying governance structure
###1269 of the internet that has worked so effectively
###1271 for our lifetime, created this thing
###1273 that's been arguably the most powerful force
###1276 for political, economic, social change
###1280 certainly in my lifetime, maybe ever.
###1282 And yet over the next year could be seriously damaged
###1284 by some international negotiations that
###1286 are playing out, particularly pushed
###1288 by authoritarian states like Russia and China.
###1291 If you like the idea of Russia's 82,000 blacklisted websites,
###1296 or if you like the building internet wall in China,
###1301 this may be the future if we don't watch out.
###1303 Particularly as some of the core swing
###1304 states, the Brazils, the Indias, the Germanys,
###1307 may not be with us the way they were previously.
###1310 Now this gap in the fields also means
###1314 when it comes to the warfare side,
###1317 we act on bad assumptions.
###1320 Or don't make connections across domains
###1323 in ways that truly matter.
###1325 So take the notion of something from the field
###1327 of war applied here, which is offense, defense,
###1329 the balance between these.
###1331 There is an idea that's taken hold that cyber offense is
###1335 inherently privileged.
###1337 It's inherently dominant against the defense.
###1339 And not just now, but as one US military report
###1342 put it, quote, "For the foreseeable future."
###1345 So for as long as we can see in the future cyber offense
###1348 will be dominant, is the assumption that's out there.
###1351 This in turn has driven the US military
###1354 to spend roughly four times as much
###1358 on cyber offense research and development
###1361 as it has on cyber defense research and development.
###1365 Now the problem with this is threefold.
###1368 The first is that it cyber offense is not
###1372 as easy as it's too often depicted.
###1375 So for example, the former number two in the Pentagon
###1378 described how, quote, "A couple of teenagers sitting
###1381 in their parents' basement, sipping Red Bull
###1384 and wearing flip-flops, could carry out a WMD-style attack."
###1390 No.
###1391 They couldn't.
###1392 They could do a lot of things, but not what he's
###1395 for portraying.
###1397 And Stuxnet is a great illustration of that.
###1399 In terms of the wide variety of skill sets
###1402 that were involved in this, everything from intelligence
###1404 analysts and collection to some of the top technical talent
###1408 in the world from multiple nations, to nuclear physicists,
###1411 to engineers, to then another espionage effort to get it back
###1415 in.
###1416 It was a Manhattan Project-style effort.
###1419 Again, the barriers to entry are lowering, but it's not just,
###1423 oh I need a teenager and some Red Bull
###1425 and I can carry this out.
###1427 The second is history is replete with examples
###1431 that every time a military assumed the offense was
###1433 inherently dominant, that it turned out to be the opposite.
###1437 And we're on the 100 year anniversary
###1439 of probably the best illustration of that.
###1441 Where the nations of Europe, prior to World War I,
###1444 all assumed that the new technologies of the day
###1447 meant that the offense was advantaged.
###1449 And in fact, it was so advantaged
###1451 that you couldn't allow yourself to be stuck on the defensive.
###1455 So you had to go to war before the other guy could.
###1458 So that you wouldn't be caught at a disadvantage.
###1461 And as we saw play out in World War I,
###1463 actually it was the defense that turned out to be dominant.
###1466 But the final issue with this is,
###1468 even if it's true it doesn't actually
###1472 mean that we should be acting the way we are.
###1477 To give a metaphor, the idea of sitting in your glass house
###1483 and looking around and saying, gosh
###1484 I'm worried about all these roving gangs of teens.
###1489 Well, my best answer is to buy a stone sharpening kit.
###1495 That's not the logic that we should be following,
###1497 but that's what we're doing right now.
###1499 So what can we do instead?
###1501 The last third of the book is all about these
###1504 what can we do questions, everything from global level
###1508 responses to national level down to corporate to you
###1511 and I. How can we protect ourselves
###1513 and the broader internet itself.
###1515 I'm not going to try and summarize
###1516 that 100 pages up here.
###1518 So I'll just hit on five themes that cut through all of it.
###1522 The first theme is knowledge matters.
###1526 It is vital that we demystify this realm if we ever
###1530 want to get anything done effective in securing it.
###1534 We have to move past the situation now
###1537 where, for example, a White House official described this
###1541 as quote, "only understood by the nerds."
###1545 Or when the President himself received a briefing
###1548 on cyber security questions.
###1551 And at the end of the briefing, reportedly asked for, repeated
###1553 back, quote, "This time in English."
###1557 That's not to beat up on the residents of the White House.
###1560 That would happen in almost any major company that's
###1565 not in this space, not in Silicon Valley, but also
###1569 even small companies, a cupcake stand.
###1572 It would happen at the White House.
###1573 It would happen at my house.
###1576 The second theme leads from this.
###1578 It's that people matter.
###1580 Cybersecurity is one of those wicked problem areas that's
###1582 rife with complexities and trade-offs.
###1585 And this is in large part not because of the technical side,
###1588 which often gets too much focus, but rather the people part.
###1591 Now it's useful from a writer's perspective,
###1594 because that gives you all the fun characters and stories
###1596 to populate.
###1598 My favorite being the time that Pakistan accidentally
###1601 kidnapped all the world's cute cat videos for a day.
###1605 But it also means that if you want
###1607 to set up best responses at the global level, business level,
###1611 all the way down to the individual level,
###1612 you need to recognize that the people behind the machines
###1615 are both part of every single problem.
###1619 And have to be part of every single solution.
###1622 This leads to the next theme.
###1624 Incentives matter.
###1626 If you want to understand why something is or isn't happening
###1629 in cybersecurity, look to the motivations,
###1632 the relative costs, the organizations
###1635 that people are in, the tensions at play between them.
###1638 There is a reason why, for example, finance companies
###1641 are doing better at their cyber security--
###1643 both in terms of defending themselves, but also sharing
###1646 information --versus how, for example,
###1649 critical infrastructure and natural gas or the power grid,
###1654 how they're not cooperating and not defending themselves well.
###1657 It's because they're incentivized both to directly
###1660 understand the cost, but also there's
###1662 a regulatory environment around them that's driving that.
###1666 And this points to the role that government
###1668 can, and frankly should, be playing.
###1670 And everything from being a trusted information
###1672 provider to setting standards to-- in other situations,
###1676 it's going to have to create market incentives, which
###1679 is another way of saying regulation.
###1682 The fourth is history matters.
###1685 There is a history to how we got here with the internet.
###1689 And too often it's ignored.
###1691 And that's when you hear these sort of silly things
###1693 like oh, well let's just build a new, more secure internet,
###1697 which is not a workable concept.
###1700 And yet it's gotten a lot of credence in policy circles.
###1703 But more broadly, it means that there's
###1705 a wealth of lessons to learn from history and other fields.
###1709 So if we're exploring, for example,
###1711 how to deal with cyber crime, but also patriotic hacker
###1715 communities that are linked to states,
###1718 we look at the age of sail as a parallel.
###1721 Where you have this domain in which
###1724 commerce, communication, and conflict all
###1727 played out on the open sea.
###1729 The conflict actors ranged from state militaries
###1732 to individual criminal groups, pirates,
###1735 to these fuzzy things in the middle, privateers,
###1737 that sort of gave you some of the advantage of pirates
###1739 but also state-linked as well.
###1741 And that's a lesson that we can look
###1743 to in how we went after that trade.
###1745 To if we want to understand good role for government, let's
###1749 look at the most successful government agencies in history.
###1753 Like the Centers for Disease Control, which literally
###1755 started with a couple of scientists
###1757 taking a $10 collection, a tin cup for $10.
###1761 And that agency went on to eradicate malaria inside United
###1764 States, to fight smallpox on an international level, to oh,
###1767 by the way, served as a critical back channel to the Soviets
###1771 in the worst part of the Cold War.
###1774 This leads to the final lesson, and it comes from the saying
###1779 that Ben Franklin had, that "An ounce of prevention
###1783 is worth a pound of cure."
###1785 What's fascinating is that the CDC did studies and proved
###1790 that Franklin's saying actually is true in public health.
###1795 It's also true in cybersecurity and cyberwar.
###1799 Very simple steps of cyber hygiene
###1803 would have an immense impact.
###1806 Indeed, one study of the top 20 controls
###1809 found that they would stop 94% of all cyber attacks.
###1813 Now some people react to that, and they go well,
###1815 I'm really special.
###1816 I'm in the 6%.
###1817 Well, statistically we all can't be in the 6%.
###1821 But even more so they should talk
###1823 to their technical folks, their IT crowd.
###1827 And they would quickly learn how if they didn't
###1830 have to spend so much time dealing with the low level
###1833 stuff, they could actually focus on the more advanced
###1837 persistent threats that are out there.
###1839 And a large part of this, what's interesting
###1841 is the data shows that senior executives are actually
###1843 twice as likely to be behind one of these problems
###1846 as junior folks, which makes it even more difficult for the IT
###1850 department to deal with.
###1852 To give some illustrations of this--
###1856 let me add one more thing on it.
###1858 The other challenge to this is that there's this assumption
###1860 that the advanced threats are all
###1862 using very advanced pathways in.
###1864 And yet consistently, they're coming
###1867 in through rather simple approaches.
###1871 For example, the most important outside penetration
###1874 of US military classified networks by a foreign espionage
###1879 agency happened when they conducted
###1882 what's known as a candy drop.
###1884 Basically they dropped memory sticks
###1887 in a parking lot outside a US military base.
###1891 And while we learn in preschool don't take candy
###1893 from strangers, a US soldier saw the shiny memory stick
###1898 in the dirt.
###1899 Thought this was really cool, picked
###1901 it up, wanted to see what was on it.
###1902 So he took it inside the base and plugged it
###1904 into his computer.
###1905 And that was actually the most important penetration
###1908 of US military networks from the outside.
###1911 To the insider threat, the episodes of Manning or Snowden.
###1917 Again, wherever you come down on them,
###1921 we can all agree that the organizations were not
###1925 following the kind of internal security norms
###1929 that a cupcake store should have.
###1931 Monitoring, for example, massively anomalous traffic,
###1935 things like that.
###1937 Now this idea of hygiene is important-- again,
###1942 when I say hygiene, picking up a memory stick
###1944 that you found in the dirt.
###1945 That's basic hygiene, that's the five second rule,
###1948 let alone cyber hygiene.
###1949 But this idea of hygiene, I think, is important not just
###1954 because of that idea of prevention, but even more so
###1958 the ethic behind it.
###1961 That we need-- again, whether we're
###1963 talking about this on a global level, a national level,
###1965 a business level, to an individual level.
###1968 I teach my kids hygiene.
###1971 Wash your hands, cover your mouth when you cough.
###1974 I teach them that not only to protect themselves,
###1976 but also that they have a responsibility
###1979 to protect all that they connect with through the course
###1982 of their day.
###1983 That's the same kind of ethic that we
###1984 need in the online space.
###1986 And we should be pushing more of that
###1987 rather than the fears that are out there driving us.
###1991 So to bring this story full circle,
###1995 in the beginning I talked about how when I was seven years old
###1999 I saw my first computer.
###2001 Now if you had told little seven-year-old me
###2005 that one day this Commodore or its descendants
###2009 would allow someone to steal your money,
###2014 steal your identity, even become a weapon of mass disruption,
###2021 I would've begged and pleaded with my dad
###2024 not to turn on the power button.
###2027 Don't let us go into this dangerous, scary world.
###2031 Today I wouldn't have it any other way.
###2035 Because that technology has given me and all of us
###2039 literally superpowers that we didn't imagine back then.
###2044 We can ask any question and Google the answer to it.
###2051 Any question, important or not important.
###2055 Yesterday I was looking up the backstory
###2058 of a minor noble in the "Game of Thrones."
###2062 That's actually the important example.
###2063 
###2066 This technology has given us the power
###2068 to become friends with people that we've literally never met.
###2076 All of these great steps forward.
###2078 And so the same as it was back then, I think,
###2082 is the way it will be in the future.
###2085 We have to accept and manage the risks of this world--
###2090 whether it's the online world or the real world, so to speak,
###2094 --because of all that can be achieved in it.
###2097 And to steal the title from the book,
###2100 in the end, that's really what everyone needs to know.
###2104 Thank you.
###2104 [APPLAUSE]
###2106 
###2112 MALE SPEAKER: We'll do a short Q&A. Please
###2114 wait for the audience mic to arrive to you.
###2117 And I wanted to mention one more thing that Peter told me about.
###2120 And this is, there's a website.
###2122 It's called cybersecuritybook.com.
###2126 And there's a cybersecurity song playlist there.
###2131 I'm curious myself now what that is.
###2134 Questions?
###2135 AUDIENCE: It seemed like one of the big problems
###2137 you mentioned was a problem of leadership.
###2139 And the people who are empowered just
###2142 don't have the sophistication to talk about these issues
###2144 and make decisions.
###2145 And I just was wondering what you
###2147 thought was the minimum level of competence
###2150 required by these people?
###2151 Because realistically, they seem to be pretty entrenched.
###2154 And I don't think it's realistic to expect
###2156 a whole new breed of people to come in and make
###2157 these decisions.
###2158 And on that point, as well, how likely do
###2161 think it is to be able to get these people to that level
###2163 of sophistication, given the fact that these people don't
###2166 know how to use email?
###2168 PETER SINGER: It's a great question.
###2171 And one part of it, sometimes people say well,
###2175 isn't this just a digital native,
###2177 digital immigrant issue?
###2180 That digital immigrants, someone who grew up in a world
###2185 without computers and then now has
###2186 moved into this world versus a native who was born into it
###2190 and it all seems natural and intuitive.
###2193 And so this problem, won't it just solve itself,
###2197 is how they sometimes reference it.
###2200 First, there's a long period of time before the immigrants,
###2206 so to speak, move out of the positions of power.
###2210 To put it a different way-- there's
###2214 a quote in the book from a guy that
###2215 talks about how the folks that are sitting in the big boy
###2218 chairs, is how he phrased it.
###2220 The big boy chairs in government or at CEOs
###2223 of a lot of different companies or the like, many of them
###2227 didn't see or use their first computer
###2229 until they were in their 30s or 40s.
###2233 But it doesn't mean one, they're going
###2236 to be in those positions for a long time.
###2238 And so we've got this gap, this period of time.
###2241 We can't wait it out.
###2242 The second is a lot of digital natives
###2246 don't have this intuitively the way it's assumed.
###2248 In large part because of how we've stovepiped these issues.
###2253 That's for the IT folks to handle.
###2256 Or the IT folks saying, oh, well that's for legal to handle,
###2258 that's not for us.
###2261 And so to your question, what's the level of expertise.
###2266 I don't think there's a common test that everyone has to pass,
###2269 or something like that.
###2270 I actually-- and this may be a little bit controversial.
###2273 I don't think it's even about people
###2274 knowing how to do things like computer programming-- maybe
###2277 it's controversial in this room.
###2279 It's instead having familiarity of the key concepts,
###2287 the key terms, so that frankly, they
###2291 can have a good argument about it.
###2295 You can see this in what's playing out with the NSA issues
###2300 recently, where both the mass media,
###2304 but also both sides in Congress that are arguing it,
###2308 it's just so factually disconnected.
###2312 And so they're not able to even have a good argument about it.
###2315 To use that illustration of offense, defense theory.
###2318 It's a great way of showing this.
###2320 Where on one hand the people that
###2322 understand the technical side don't
###2325 know that there's actually a very rich literature
###2327 in international relations of offense, defense,
###2330 that doesn't lead you to one conclusion or the other.
###2332 And they were sort of-- they picked one part of it and said,
###2335 this is the conclusion of what we should take.
###2336 In turn the IR crowd doesn't understand this all that well.
###2341 The bigger thing is not a level of knowledge, it's an attitude.
###2345 There's too much Ludditism out there that's celebrated.
###2350 A senior government official who held responsibility
###2353 for this literally saying, doesn't
###2356 think it's all that useful.
###2358 And she did the same thing the SecDef did,
###2360 where if their email came in it's
###2362 printed out by the assistant.
###2364 They write their answer on it.
###2365 And then they hand it back.
###2367 You can't be effective if that's the kind of attitude
###2370 that you have, both for your internal
###2371 but you think it's OK to talk to others about it that way.
###2376 And so for me it's, again, there's
###2379 some base level of knowledge.
###2380 But it's more about changing the attitudes around it.
###2382 And frankly stop looking at this as just a highly technical
###2387 issue for, again, the IT crowd, or for the nerds.
###2392 AUDIENCE: What principles have we
###2394 learned from the behavior of immune systems and biology,
###2399 and from the resilience of biological networks
###2402 all the way from the metabolic networks
###2403 up to ecologies, what principles have we learned that we are not
###2408 yet applying in cybersecurity?
###2411 PETER SINGER: That's actually a great question
###2412 to bridge back to the prior question.
###2414 Because that all-important word that you used,
###2418 resilience, is what I think should
###2421 be at the centerpiece of our approaches
###2424 and our discussions and the like.
###2425 
###2429 And you see this, again, on the government side.
###2433 But also on the business side.
###2437 Basically there's this mentality of offense, defense.
###2441 And defense, it's build higher or thicker walls.
###2446 
###2448 And then the offense side is, weirdly enough,
###2452 coming back into the private sector
###2454 with the emergence of the potential hack back industry,
###2457 of oh, the best way to protect yourself is not just
###2460 to build a high wall but we'll go after the bad guys for you.
###2465 It's basically a business version of vigilantism.
###2469 It has major concerns for international relations,
###2473 because it could quickly escalate things
###2475 in a way that's unplanned.
###2477 It's also a horrible business model for the client.
###2481 Vigilantism only worked for Charles Bronson.
###2486 This idea of the best way to defend yourself-- I'm
###2490 going to go after this guy.
###2491 And then oh, you're attacking?
###2492 I'll go after this guy, this guy, this guy.
###2493 And so at the end of the day all you're
###2495 doing is paying someone to go after others for you,
###2497 not actually making yourself secure.
###2499 Instead of this mentality, it goes
###2501 to what you asked about, resilience.
###2503 And you can think about this in the physiological way.
###2507 And that turns on everything from the notion of it being
###2511 not a Cold War-- you know, this idea of we're
###2514 in a new Cold War is literally a quote from folks.
###2517 
###2520 One, malware is not like the physics of a nuclear weapon.
###2525 Second, there's not the bipolar relationship of two powers.
###2529 The players in cybersecurity are just
###2532 like the players in cyberspace.
###2534 It's everything from the 100 cyber military units
###2537 out there to non-state collectives
###2541 interested in everything from cute cats to online protest
###2545 to corporations that range from Google to Target
###2548 to the cupcake store.
###2549 And so it doesn't fit that to the online battle of ideas
###2553 is not the ideological Cold War battle that it's framed.
###2557 The online battle of ideas are-- go on YouTube
###2561 and you can see the diversity of them.
###2563 And so instead it's this ecosystem of players.
###2566 And then it goes to the idea of the physiological approach
###2569 of your own body.
###2570 Our bodies are probably the most resilient thing ever created.
###2573 
###2577 They're designed for a world that's incredibly hostile.
###2581 They expect that bad things are going to happen.
###2583 They have a really great exterior line
###2585 of defense, your skin.
###2587 But they fully plan that that skin, at some point,
###2591 will definitely be penetrated.
###2593 And it has all sorts of systems to react to that.
###2597 Everything from stemming the flow to monitoring infection,
###2601 internal monitoring systems, to your body triages
###2604 between what's important what's not
###2606 to-- guess what, your body itself
###2608 operates on the assumption that something external is already
###2611 inside.
###2612 There's 10 times as much-- when you
###2615 look at the number of cell counts,
###2617 there's 10 times as much bacteria
###2618 and the like in your body than there are human cells.
###2621 And again compare that to the typical oh, just buy my widget,
###2626 or if I have a better, stronger password I'll keep them out.
###2629 But there's another idea of resilience
###2631 that I don't think we pay enough attention to.
###2634 And that's psychological resilience.
###2638 There's 3,000 books on psychological resilience
###2643 of some sort.
###2644 Resilience in your job, resilience in your love life,
###2649 et cetera.
###2650 And it's all built around the idea
###2651 that you can't go through life thinking
###2654 that bad things will never happen,
###2656 or they can all be deterred or defeated.
###2659 Instead, your success is dependent on your assumption
###2663 that bad things will play out.
###2665 But it's all about how will you power through them?
###2667 How will you recover quickly from them?
###2669 How will you not allow them to knock you down in the way
###2672 that they could?
###2673 All these different way-- and again, you
###2675 can think about in your love life to your job, whatever.
###2677 We need that same mentality when it comes to cyber.
###2682 So take cyberterrorism, the central discussion
###2688 of, oh my god, the power grid might go down.
###2692 And in fact, you've seen all of these false news reports
###2694 about times that cyber attacks caused it.
###2697 Which either in one situation the power didn't go out,
###2702 it's a false story that-- guess what,
###2704 "60 Minutes" unsurprisingly covered.
###2707 To another situation, things that are described as cyber
###2710 attacks that they're not.
###2711 So two dudes with a rifle, that's not a cyber attack.
###2715 But that was recently in the news covered as in this.
###2718 The bottom line is that squirrels have taken down
###2721 more power grids than the zero times that hackers have.
###2726 Again, it could play out.
###2727 But it's all about how will we react to it.
###2729 
###2732 Where I live outside Washington, the power
###2735 went down multiple times this summer.
###2737 
###2741 But if it had been a cyber attack that caused it,
###2745 we would have had a congressional commission
###2747 investigating who to blame.
###2749 And we would have had mass hysteria around it.
###2753 And so what I would prefer-- and I go back to that echo of 9/11
###2756 and how you react --is the British mentality to terrorism,
###2761 keep calm and carry on.
###2763 Rather than the American model, which is
###2767 we try and out-escalate the hype and the fear around it.
###2772 Because we're seeing more gains in the fear and hype.
###2777 And my worry is that's carrying over to cyber side.
###2780 AUDIENCE: The cyber crime that really matters in the Snowden
###2783 story is not what Snowden did, but what he revealed.
###2789 Alexander has two mandates, both offense and defense.
###2794 And as we've seen and as you've said,
###2797 the offense has dominated in his activities.
###2802 But whether offense inevitably dominates,
###2807 as they seem to think and as is premised behind their actions,
###2812 they've loaded the dice.
###2814 Part of what they've done is rather than
###2816 also act on their defensive mandate,
###2820 they have purposely gone out and inserted vulnerabilities,
###2825 worked with vendors of security software
###2829 to purposely insert vulnerabilities,
###2831 making us more vulnerable.
###2834 And as you said, incentives matter.
###2837 Let's take a look-- in the absence of Snowden,
###2840 let's take a look at the incentives
###2842 on secret intelligence agencies themselves.
###2846 What is the bureaucratic reward for successfully carrying out
###2850 an attack?
###2851 And what is the bureaucratic reward
###2854 for successfully preventing attacks that aren't visible
###2858 because they couldn't happen?
###2861 The second is invisible.
###2863 The bureaucratic reward structure
###2865 has no means to reward it.
###2868 And in the absence of Snowden, the first is cost-free.
###2872 PETER SINGER: I'm in agreement with you on a couple of areas.
###2875 One, on the notion of incentives.
###2878 And again, you can see that whether you're
###2880 talking about within that intelligence agency to why
###2884 we see on the defense side certain industries cooperate
###2887 or not.
###2887 And it all turns on that.
###2888 But then there's the broader-- essentially
###2890 you pulled the bandage of Snowden.
###2894 And so we've got to go at it.
###2895 And you began by hitting one part of his activity.
###2900 And I think this is the challenge right now
###2902 in the discussion and debate around him,
###2907 the NSA, is he a traitor, is he a whistleblower, should he
###2910 get clemency or the like, is that essentially he
###2916 gathered and now is being released-- actually not by him.
###2922 This is one of the myths that's out there.
###2924 It's not him pulling the strings right now.
###2927 The journalists, they're actually going through it.
###2930 And the challenge for them is because there's so much,
###2933 it actually involves, again, a very different set
###2935 of expertise.
###2936 So someone who understands the technology will not
###2941 get-- they'll see a name pop up that, say, the Latin America
###2945 beat reporter will go whoa, whoa, whoa, that name.
###2948 That guy's now the Deputy Foreign Minister of Brazil.
###2951 That name is meaningless to the person
###2952 who knows what this acronym means that the Latin America
###2956 reporter doesn't know that.
###2957 And then in turn you need the spy and the like.
###2959 So they're actually having these teams go through it
###2962 and figuring out what's newsworthy or not.
###2967 But the bottom line is there's such a mass of information
###2970 and the wide variety of stories that have come out
###2972 and will continue to come out is that it essentially
###2977 falls into three very different buckets of activity
###2982 that has been disclosed.
###2984 The first bucket of activity is frankly
###2987 what I would describe as smart strategic espionage
###2992 against American enemies.
###2995 And you hit sort of the mentality
###2997 that drive some of that.
###2999 Now there's an issue of-- you said they
###3001 when you're talking about NSA versus cyber command.
###3003 And they're the top military intelligence agency.
###3005 But the bottom line is one bucket of activity
###3008 was things that we would expect and want an agency to do.
###3015 Going after monitoring terror rings in Pakistan,
###3020 Iranian nuclear research, China, et cetera.
###3024 Bucket number two is what I would term questionable.
###3028 Activities that there is a debate around
###3031 because it involves US citizens in some way, shape, or form.
###3035 Either through legal approaches on the front door to back door
###3040 to running with an authorization in a way
###3043 that the policymaker that authorized it didn't understand
###3047 what was authorized to essentially deals
###3051 made with foreign intelligence agencies
###3053 where they were able to collect things in a way
###3055 that we couldn't, an exchange of information and the like.
###3057 But basically the debate around involvement of US citizens.
###3061 Category three is the bucket that I
###3065 would describe as unstrategic, or more directly stupid.
###3069 And that is targeting of close American allies
###3073 and American technology companies.
###3076 And the resonance of that is everything
###3080 from how I mentioned the hammering
###3082 to other kinds of international negotiations that
###3085 may matter more to as you mentioned,
###3088 the undermining of cybersecurity for all of us.
###3093 Particularly based on this assumption
###3094 that they were the only ones smart enough
###3096 to find the vulnerability, but then more broadly what
###3100 it's done to that critical word, trust,
###3103 trust in American technology companies.
###3105 And the resonance of that, at least
###3106 according to Forrester Research, is
###3108 that your industry will lose approximately $180 billion
###3111 worth of revenue.
###3112 That's why people here are pissed.
###3114 The problem, though, is that in the debate around it
###3119 we pull from whichever bucket we care most about.
###3123 So if you care most about classic national security,
###3126 you go, this guy disclosed things that are important.
###3129 He is a traitor, dada, dada, dada.
###3131 If you care about the privacy Fourth Amendment questions,
###3135 you only talk about those, and he's
###3138 a whistleblower, and clemency, and the like.
###3140 We see it also in how we defend it
###3143 from the narrative on the government side.
###3145 So these kind of activities are to prevent another 9/11.
###3151 Which may describe bucket two and the metadata and the like,
###3156 but that doesn't make the Germans feel better
###3158 about why you were going after Angela Merkel's
###3161 messages, or the like.
###3163 And so the problem is it's all of these things at once.
###3167 And it's muddied the water of the discussions.
###3169 And we can even see this most recently
###3171 in the President's speech, which, again, focused primarily
###3174 on one of the buckets, mostly the privacy side.
###3177 Because that's what matters most in the American political
###3180 debate, but actually may not matter
###3182 the most in the long term national security
###3185 and economic prosperity of the nation, which
###3187 is weird and scary to say.
###3191 AUDIENCE: Just a question on how Silicon Valley companies can
###3194 partner with each other and with the government to actually
###3198 have better government surveillance policies, right?
###3200 Recently, we saw the government surveillance reform,
###3203 where like seven companies have got together.
###3205 And again, it's going back to the notion of us versus them
###3208 where instead of partnering, it's
###3209 now they're pushing for like reforms,
###3213 and wasting lobbying dollars and stuff while it
###3215 could be a better partnership.
###3216 So what are you thoughts on what we could do?
###3221 PETER SINGER: There's steps that can be taken.
###3224 But one of the underlying things this is attitude.
###3228 And it's funny, I was out here a little over a year ago.
###3234 And there was sort of an attitude towards,
###3239 DC is so dysfunctional.
###3242 Nothing could get done there.
###3244 You guys are so problematic.
###3246 We don't want anything to do with you.
###3249 And we don't need anything to do with you.
###3252 And then now we see the flip side of that of actually
###3256 what you do matters to us.
###3258 You're still dysfunctional.
###3260 But it matters to us.
###3262 And in turn, you saw that approach from-- again,
###3268 this is from the stovepiping-- Individuals pursuing
###3274 a certain political goal, and within just a limited circle,
###3282 not understanding the ripple effects of what they were doing
###3285 on lots of other areas including one
###3288 of the cornerstones of American prosperity, which
###3290 is our technology industry.
###3293 So the problem is first knocking down that attitude
###3297 that neither side matters to the other
###3300 and doesn't need to understand the other.
###3302 
###3308 Too often, Silicon Valley-- and even sort
###3310 of the reaction when I said this in the speech
###3316 --will offer a seeming technologic solution
###3319 to a problem.
###3322 There's far more engineers out here
###3325 than almost any other specialty.
###3328 And so there's often-- you know, we
###3329 can engineer our way out of it some way, shape, or form.
###3332 And we even see that now in this discussion over privacy
###3338 where it was OK, we can't figure out what to do.
###3341 But Attorney General and Head of National Intelligence,
###3347 you've got 60 days to figure out this solution.
###3351 And we see different sort of things
###3352 offered that are sort of a technical solution.
###3356 It's not going to be a technical solution.
###3359 It's going to be an awful, painful grind of policy
###3364 and votes and court decisions and lobbying
###3367 and all these other things that go
###3369 into the nasty sausage of political process.
###3374 But in turn, what I'm getting at, too often
###3377 we fail to look at the human side of what can be done.
###3380 And that would be another aspect of it.
###3383 But the bottom line is we clearly
###3386 have a shared stake in it.
###3388 And I hope we can raise the level of discourse
###3393 and raise the level of cooperation.
###3395 AUDIENCE: Hi, Peter.
###3396 Great to see the book finally come out.
###3398 What are you optimistic about?
###3401 PETER SINGER: I thought-- I mean, look,
###3403 I'm actually hugely optimistic about-- I mean,
###3410 the possibilities of this technology, what it's allowed
###3413 to accomplish, and in turn the people who misuse it,
###3420 and what they're costing themselves.
###3423 And that misuse is everything from-- there's
###3429 a very real danger of the balkanization of the internet.
###3433 On the other hand, the cost of that to those nations,
###3438 it will be staggering.
###3441 A flip way of putting it is, there's
###3445 one nation that has been really, really great
###3447 cyber security protections-- North Korea.
###3449 There's a cost to that.
###3451 
###3454 And we can see this in turn on the debate around the NSA
###3457 to businesses.
###3458 I gave all of these anecdotes of how they're not doing it well,
###3461 but now they're facing cost to it.
###3463 The recent examples of, be it Target or Snapchat or Neiman
###3467 Marcus, is that there's an ebb and flow.
###3470 And people that mishandle it face costs.
###3473 And so to me, that's where we'll see reactions.
###3476 The incentives will drive it.
###3479 If there's any message from the book,
###3481 it's that this is seemingly scary stuff.
###3484 And some of it should be scary.
###3486 But on the other hand, we can't have a good discussion
###3490 if it's like Spinal Tap and the volume's always at 11.
###3493 Which has been how we've talked about it.
###3496 And so the goal of the book was basically
###3498 to fill this kind of sweet spot where you either
###3500 had this highly technical discussion that
###3503 was exclusionary or you had the histrionic side.
###3507 And instead, I think this can be a topic--
###3510 I think it has to be a topic that we're all better equipped
###3513 to talk about.
###3513 And I'm optimistic that when we do understand this,
###3516 we can go much further than where we're at right now.
###3521 MALE SPEAKER: And on this optimistic note,
###3523 please give a hand to Peter Singer.
###3526
