###12 ERIK ELLINGTON: This is where I'm going to put the tire
###13 swing, and eventually I'll build Julius's tree fort.
###17 That's going to be sick.
###19 
###21 I'm going to refinish that, get it all cleaned up, maybe
###24 put some white Christmas tree lights around here, make it
###27 all enchanted.
###30 This is the grand finale right here.
###32 
###37 There's downtown Hollywood.
###40 MALE SPEAKER: In life, like--
###41 I mean, you seem like you've come a long way in life to get
###44 a place like this.
###45 ERIK ELLINGTON: Yeah, I feel like that.
###47 I'm definitely pretty thankful, man.
###49 I try not to take it for granted.
###52 MALE SPEAKER: You didn't grow up wealthy or anything?
###54 ERIK ELLINGTON: No, no.
###55 We moved around a lot.
###56 When we lived in Alaska, my step-dad--
###58 he had money.
###59 He made a decent living.
###60 He had a body shop for cars and stuff.
###64 But then like, move back and forth, shit goes wrong up
###67 there, move into a janky little apartment.
###70 Or, you know, whatever.
###72 We've been up and down.
###74 I think it's a good way.
###76 It's a good experience.
###78 To know both sides of the tracks.
###83 Hey, how you doing?
###86 Oh, I just bought the house right here.
###88 Yeah.
###89 I'm Erik Ellington.
###90 PATRICK O'DELL: Hi.
###90 Welcome back to the show.
###92 This episode is about one of my favorite
###94 skaters, Erik Ellington.
###96 Erik's style is always really cool, and the
###99 way he lands tricks.
###101 He's got something that he has that not very many other
###103 skaters have.
###104 It's kind of sketchy, but it just looks so cool.
###108 And he's still of my favorite dudes.
###109 He's the kind of guy, you see him do a flat ground kickflip,
###111 and you go, oh, that's why that guy's pro.
###114 MALE SPEAKER: Wait, what's on that tape you were
###116 going to give me?
###117 ERIK ELLINGTON: Old footage from Alaska.
###119 Like, sponsor me tape footage, when I
###121 was like 15 or something.
###125 We had a launch ramp.
###126 We put the launch ramp up to a high ledge or something.
###131 Just all kinds of stuff.
###132 Like, little rails and curbs and shit.
###135 MALE SPEAKER: What kind of gear are you wearing?
###137 ERIK ELLINGTON: Let me see.
###138 Oh actually, 101 had just started, maybe.
###142 Yeah.
###143 It's just maybe like shorts and a beanie and--
###147 I don't know--
###148 a purple t-shirt or something.
###149 I don't know.
###151 I did a 360 flip board lipslide on a curb, just a
###155 regular curb where you're sliding and your wheel's over,
###157 so it's like--
###160 What else was there?
###161 Nollie nose manual.
###164 Just some stuff at the time, it seemed like it was like--
###167 at the time of that, it was kind of--
###170 I was pretty psyched.
###171 
###178 Maybe it was a little bit before that, I sent the tape
###180 to H-Street.
###181 And they sent me the Mike Carroll
###182 Calvin and Hobbes board.
###184 Yeah, I was freaking out, man.
###186 I was shaking when I got the box.
###188 That was pretty cool.
###189 
###192 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah!
###194 Fuck, that was bad.
###196 
###199 [PHONE RINGING]
###201 JAMIE THOMAS: Hello?
###202 PATRICK O'DELL: Jamie.
###203 This is Patrick.
###206 JAMIE THOMAS: Patrick, this is Jamie.
###207 PATRICK O'DELL: What's up, man?
###208 JAMIE THOMAS: Not much.
###209 PATRICK O'DELL: How would you describe Erik's skating?
###212 
###215 JAMIE THOMAS: This is kind of a hard one.
###216 It's kind of like, that's not really a good--
###218 I know you probably will only use the things that make sense
###220 in this interview.
###221 But what am I supposed to say?
###223 He looks sick.
###224 And doing stuff good.
###226 Like, that's a hard thing to answer.
###228 MALE SPEAKER: What tricks have you done that you were the
###230 most psyched on?
###230 That you look back and you go, that was my pinnacle trick?
###234 ERIK ELLINGTON: I don't know.
###234 I hope I really haven't had a pinnacle trick.
###236 I don't even know.
###237 I mean, I'd say like an era or something.
###239 Like, just times--
###241 times in your life different things are happening, and you
###243 feel differently about--
###244 you know, I don't know.
###245 First video that I was in that was--
###248 I guess it would have had to have been
###250 the first Zero video.
###252 Thrill of it All was the first video I was in that was kind
###256 of major, where everybody saw it.
###258 But before that was the Welcome to Hell video in the
###260 fringe section.
###261 Because Jamie Thomas came out to Arizona.
###266 Me and Scott Copalman talked to Jamie quite a bit.
###268 And it was like we were on Balance at the time, and he
###271 was starting Zero clothing.
###273 So he wanted us to ride for the clothing.
###276 Actually, he wanted Scott to ride for the clothing.
###280 And Scott said he wouldn't do it unless I was on too.
###284 Well, he just said, I won't leave Balance unless Erik
###286 comes with me.
###288 So by default, I got on Zero.
###291 JUSTIN REGAN: But he did have some slams.
###294 There's this one where--
###295 and I'm not even sure if it's the same video.
###297 But it's like this kinked rail.
###300 And like, I don't know.
###303 He just decided he wanted to go off and do this rail.
###306 And he got wrecked on it.
###309 ERIK ELLINGTON: Oh, yeah.
###309 I tried to boardslide that thing.
###311 I don't know what I was thinking.
###312 I can't really even boardslide kinked rails.
###313 I just thought, maybe I could do it.
###315 
###319 MALE SPEAKER: (SLOW MOTION) Fucking shit.
###322 ERIK ELLINGTON: Dude, that thing was like--
###323 
###326 I think it was like three or four kinks.
###329 No, I tried it about maybe 20 times or something.
###333 No, I slid through a couple of the kinks.
###335 You got to, like--
###336 I don't know.
###336 I just don't really know how to do it.
###338 I was just amped, you know?
###340 MALE SPEAKER: You just thought--
###340 ERIK ELLINGTON: I thought I could do it.
###342 JUSTIN REGAN: Erik's one of those skaters that--
###345 he puts in the work to get his part.
###349 When he does a trick, it just looks so cool.
###352 And there's like sweat flying, and his shirt's dirty because
###357 you know he was battling for it.
###360 But somehow the one that he makes, it's effortless.
###365 ERIK ELLINGTON: Zero time was cool because
###366 I was kind of like--
###367 I was on the verge of being kicked off Zero, and I was on
###370 the verge of not knowing what I was going
###372 to do with my life.
###374 And then it was like--
###375 I was just like, fuck, I'm in California.
###380 Tripping out, ready to be chop, chop, chopped.
###383 
###385 I don't know.
###386 Adrian Lopez told me.
###387 One time he was like, man--
###388 because we were on a tour, and it was just sort of towards
###390 the ending.
###390 Like, it was after that Thrill of it All video came out.
###394 And it was like, I think Jamie had a little bit higher
###396 expectations for what I was supposed to be doing.
###401 And then I didn't really come through.
###404 I kind of was just piled out.
###405 I was thinking like, oh, I was just smooth sailing.
###409 And then he kind of let me know I wasn't, but in a way
###411 that it was like--
###412 I think it taught me quite a bit about things that have
###415 worn off on me-- to where to this day-- that I look back on
###418 and think like, those are some fucking pretty important tips
###424 or pointers or whatever.
###426 JAMIE THOMAS: We're trying to film for Misled Youth, and
###428 Scotty and Erik went through a spell of several months
###431 without doing absolutely anything.
###433 And everybody on the team was trying to film, and everyone
###436 was trying to do things and get stuff going for the video.
###439 And those guys were starting to drink a little more and
###443 starting to do their own thing.
###444 It kind of really didn't have anything to do with what we
###446 were doing.
###448 And Eric had this sketchbook, and he just-- it was basically
###451 a sketchbook and a journal, and he just wrote everything
###453 about every day and all this stuff.
###455 We're riding in a van on this tour, and Lopez like leaned
###458 over and borrowed Erik's pencil and drew a boot.
###462 Like, when we were filming for Misled Youth, he probably had
###466 10 or 15 tricks right up until the last month of the video.
###470 He seriously probably filmed a trick a
###472 month up to that point.
###474 And then all of a sudden he filmed like 25
###476 tricks in one month.
###477 And it was all the gnarliest stuff in Misled Youth.
###480 It was all done in one month.
###482 And so it goes to show what he's capable of and his
###485 potential, but he just always put it off until
###489 he had to do it.
###490 And then when he had to do it, he would always get it done.
###492 So that's pretty much the story of Misled Youth.
###495 His part came together in the last month and helped launch
###498 his pro career.
###499 It's pretty rad.
###502 ERIK ELLINGTON: They take a look from outside of being in
###505 his circle, and they just hear what he's doing.
###508 And a lot of the things I disagree with, a lot of things
###511 he probably disagrees with what I'm doing.
###513 And then a lot of people fucking--
###516 I don't know--
###517 talk shit or something.
###518 But it's like, he's down to work.
###520 And if somebody's not putting in the work, then he's going
###522 to let them know.
###523 He's not going to pussy foot around the fact
###526 to that, you know?
###527 MALE SPEAKER: Fuck him up!
###528 
###531 ERIK ELLINGTON: Julius, come here.
###533 
###536 Come here.
###539 GREG: My name's Greg, by the way.
###540 ERIK ELLINGTON: Erik.
###541 GREG: How do you do?
###541 ERIK ELLINGTON: Nice to meet you.
###542 
###548 Yeah, pro skater.
###550 
###562 What is it?
###564 
###567 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
###568 But I wouldn't be able to tell you without knowing
###570 what it was, but--
###572 GREG: You understand why--
###572 ERIK ELLINGTON: I understand that, though.
###574 I understand that.
###575 But I pretty much--
###576 I can give you some--
###577 you could probably talk to the people that are running this
###580 thing, and then maybe they can give you some advice on what
###582 to do and kind of handle things that way.
###586 And I was like, I'm a little confused.
###588 You know, I can't really give you much advice.
###593 I don't know what it is.
###595 I pointed him to Erica.
###596 I pawned him off on Erica.
###599 NECK FACE: Oh, Ellington is--
###601 Ellington's my favorite.
###602 I mean, he was my favorite growing up.
###604 Like, seeing his skating and shit.
###606 Like, damn, this fool's straight white trash fucking
###609 skating and shit.
###610 And then when I met the dude, it was like
###614 even more of my favorite.
###615 I was like, damn, this fool doesn't give
###617 a shit about anything.
###618 He's fucking crazy.
###619 Ellington is nuts.
###621 
###627 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, shit!
###628 
###631 ERIK ELLINGTON: Let's get fucked up tonight!
###633 ANDREW REYNOLDS: To me, when I look at him,
###634 he's like Eric Koston.
###638 But just with this like--
###640 take away all the perfection and everything and add this
###647 lazy attitude problem or something.
###649 He's that good, but it's just like, well whatever.
###652 He's really that good.
###655 And it's just like, everything he does has this special
###658 Ellington style about it, like every move he makes.
###661 It's in his skating, in his walk, when he bowls, when he
###665 carries his kid.
###666 It's just this certain way of doing it.
###669 ERIK ELLINGTON: It's not too bad except that the top
###673 doesn't really match the pants.
###677 All right.
###677 Ooh, let me get a little--
###679 MALE SPEAKER: Te-qui-lia.
###680 ERIK ELLINGTON: Have a bit of that.
###682 MALE SPEAKER: Little standby.
###683 
###685 ERIK ELLINGTON: Little tequila right in there, huh?
###687 You look beautiful.
###689 Look at you.
###690 Look at you.
###693 [KISSING]
###695 [THUD]
###696 FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh!
###696 ERIK ELLINGTON: Jujube!
###697 FEMALE SPEAKER: All right!
###699 MALE SPEAKER: How'd you meet her?
###701 ERIK ELLINGTON: She was out here.
###702 I wanted to take her out for dinner, and then she took off
###704 the next morning and ditched me.
###706 So then I took a train down to San Diego, and I
###709 shacked up with her.
###711 Ever since then, I moved into her apartment with like three
###713 of her friends.
###715 They bought a Suzuki Swift, this fucking piece of shit.
###719 And we were driving that thing back and forth all the time.
###722 It's like, damn, got a car, rolling.
###728 Yeah, we got married three months after that.
###729 MALE SPEAKER: Really?
###730 Three months?
###731 ERIK ELLINGTON: Mm-hmm.
###731 And we've been married for seven years in October.
###734 MALE SPEAKER: Whoa, so you just knew at three months?
###735 ERIK ELLINGTON: How do you like that?
###737 MALE SPEAKER: You got actually--
###738 did you plan it out?
###740 ERIK ELLINGTON: No, no.
###740 We were like, well let's just get married.
###743 Fuck it.
###745 
###747 BRAYDON SZAFRANSKI: Check.
###747 One, two, one, two.
###749 What it is.
###752 Please get the stages of Erik.
###754 The drunken stages are by far the best thing of him.
###758 Like, his skating, amazing.
###759 His life, amazing.
###761 Drunken stages, golden.
###764 First, OK.
###765 Like, I've seen him tonight.
###767 He has a button up shirt on.
###768 Great.
###769 So this is where you can fully catch his stages.
###772 What'd he start with?
###772 Probably like five or six buttons down it.
###775 You know what I mean?
###776 The more he drinks-- because this is an open bar in here.
###779 The more he drinks, every half an hour, a
###782 button will be popped.
###783 Bam.
###783 Easily.
###785 Was that a fourth button?
###786 ERIK ELLINGTON: That's a fourth button.
###787 BRAYDON SZAFRANSKI: Did I just see a fourth--
###788 I seen it.
###790 I actually witnessed it with my own eyes.
###792 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Look, it fits perfectly in there.
###793 Look, look, look.
###794 Look.
###795 BRAYDON SZAFRANSKI: Whoa, it does fit perfectly in there.
###798 Whoa!
###799 
###801 MALE SPEAKER: Don't do that.
###803 DUSTIN DOLLIN: Anyway, he's basically my father.
###806 I don't have one.
###808 So he's pretty much the tough guy I got to look up to.
###813 You know what you should do?
###814 You should do an episode on all of our mothers.
###817 That would be a fucking--
###818 our mother--
###819 his father.
###820 Like, whoever we think's weirdest in our family.
###822 BRAYDON SZAFRANSKI: Yeah, everyone in the family that's
###823 just jacked.
###824 
###826 ERIK ELLINGTON: Well, I'll call you in a little bit.
###828 All right?
###830 All right.
###832 MALE SPEAKER: Luciana?
###832 ERIK ELLINGTON: Yeah.
###834 MALE SPEAKER: You had to get permission for another night?
###840 ERIK ELLINGTON: Well, I didn't really get permission.
###843 MALE SPEAKER: What'd she say?
###844 ERIK ELLINGTON: She's just over it.
###847 Yeah, it's been like a lot of nights in a row.
###851 I normally don't even go out anymore.
###853 Me and her, we just chill at the house, watch
###855 movies or do whatever.
###858 Damn.
###859 It's like, all this.
###860 This makes me so happy.
###861 My son makes me happy-- my wife, my mom, my family, my
###864 friends, all that.
###865 But then it's just like, you land something that you didn't
###868 think you could do or something.
###869 And it's just like--
###870 I mean it's like the best-- gives you chills, you know?
###873 It's the best thing ever.
###874 
###877 Give the camera a kiss.
###878 
###883 Where'd you guys park?
###884 Down here?
###885 
###887 One, two, three.
###890 Woo!
###891
