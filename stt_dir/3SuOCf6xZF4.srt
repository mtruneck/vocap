It's pretty much
a pot festival.

Usually, Nimbin only has a

there's expected to be 10,000

HANNAH BROOKS: Nimbin's a
country town in the hills of


17
0:0:42,38 --> 0:0:43,72
eastern Australia.


18
0:0:43,72 --> 0:0:45,93
And it's known worldwide as
the center of Australian


19
0:0:45,93 --> 0:0:47,36
cannabis culture.


20
0:0:47,36 --> 0:0:49,72
Unlike the rest of the country,
which prides itself


21
0:0:49,72 --> 0:0:52,43
on its pubs and beer, it's
almost impossible to get a


22
0:0:52,43 --> 0:0:53,6
drink in Nimbin.


23
0:0:53,6 --> 0:0:55,41
But pot smoking is encouraged
in everywhere.


24
0:0:55,41 --> 0:0:58,87



25
0:0:58,87 --> 0:1:1,77
It's a big reputation for
small, one street town.


26
0:1:1,77 --> 0:1:4,61
I'd heard how easy it is to
score drugs in Nimbin.


27
0:1:4,61 --> 0:1:7,22
And as soon as I arrived, I
was offered weed, hash,


28
0:1:7,22 --> 0:1:9,8
cookies, mushrooms, and acid.


29
0:1:9,8 --> 0:1:11,39
But the old hippies who run
the town hate the street

selling harder drugs like

Instead of the phantom,
there's The Plantom.

promotes the use of cannabis.

term is God has come.

0:4:47,41 --> 0:4:48,71

0:4:48,71 --> 0:4:50,43

a quiet, country town with a


153
0:5:43,38 --> 0:5:45,9
thriving timber and
dairy industry.


154
0:5:45,9 --> 0:5:49,34
But in the early 1970s, Nimbin
hit hard times and was almost


155
0:5:49,34 --> 0:5:50,63
a ghost town.


156
0:5:50,63 --> 0:5:53,64
In 1973, a bunch of hippies,
attracted by the cheap


157
0:5:53,64 --> 0:5:56,69
infrastructure and beautiful
landscape, came to Nimbin and


158
0:5:56,69 --> 0:5:58,52
held the Aquarius Festival.


159
0:5:58,52 --> 0:6:0,81
Many of them stayed and set
up communes and sought to


160
0:6:0,81 --> 0:6:3,4
establish a new type
of society.


161
0:6:3,4 --> 0:6:5,63
The hills surrounding the area
also made it the perfect place


162
0:6:5,63 --> 0:6:8,12
to grow lots of weed.


163
0:6:8,12 --> 0:6:10,88
Nimbin and cannabis quickly
became synonymous.


164
0:6:10,88 --> 0:6:13,57
However, since it's illegal to
grow, sell, and smoke weed in


165
0:6:13,57 --> 0:6:16,84
Australia, there are always
going to be problems.


166
0:6:16,84 --> 0:6:19,73
15 years ago, some locals held
a protest to highlight what


167
0:6:19,73 --> 0:6:22,34
they saw as the stupidity
of the drug laws.


168
0:6:22,34 --> 0:6:24,52
This became a tradition and over
the years, turned into


169
0:6:24,52 --> 0:6:26,56
what is now known
as MardiGrasss.

0:6:26,56 --> 0:6:29,99

the street with a big joint,

0:6:34,0 --> 0:6:35,95
lot of noise and hoo-hah.


173
0:6:35,95 --> 0:6:38,47
And there was a collection
of local people.


174
0:6:38,47 --> 0:6:41,75
The next year, they decided to
try and attract more people.


175
0:6:41,75 --> 0:6:44,38
And it sort of went
on from there.


176
0:6:44,38 --> 0:6:46,51
As the people arrived, peoples
thought, oh, well we better


177
0:6:46,51 --> 0:6:48,71

to attract them.

There was a realization that

HANNAH BROOKS: There was quite
a few police here last year

0:8:26,15 --> 0:8:27,1
last year, is that correct?


221
0:8:27,1 --> 0:8:27,27
-That's correct.


222
0:8:27,27 --> 0:8:29,26
There was a substantial number
of police last year.


223
0:8:29,26 --> 0:8:29,91
HANNAH BROOKS: And
why was that?


224
0:8:29,91 --> 0:8:34,8
-Given the nature and the size
of this particular event, we


225
0:8:34,8 --> 0:8:36,28
wanted to have adequate police
out here, just to ensure that


226
0:8:36,28 --> 0:8:37,84
there was a safe environment.


227
0:8:37,84 --> 0:8:41,27
There is a perception that when
MardiGrass is on that


228
0:8:41,27 --> 0:8:44,97
certain activities involving
cannabis are legal, such as


229
0:8:44,97 --> 0:8:47,41
the possession of,
administration of, or supply


230
0:8:47,41 --> 0:8:48,66
of cannabis.

0:8:48,66 --> 0:8:49,53
That is not the case.

If the police catch people in
possession of cannabis, if


233

they catch them supplying it, or
indeed, administering it--


234

they will be arrested.

HANNAH BROOKS: Instead, Nimbin
promotes its own kind of law.


241
0:9:11,21 --> 0:9:13,675
It's got a street code that

0:9:15,52 --> 0:9:17,61
The locals' disdain for the

eye to it all, sometimes
