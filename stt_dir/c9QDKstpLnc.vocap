###40 (male voice-over). Live from the
###43 Buzzard Auditorium on the campus of
###46 Eastern Illinois University, it's "Issues and Attitudes".
###55 (Dr. Janice Collins). Good evening.
###56 Good evening and welcome to "Issues and Attitudes", a town
###59 hall meeting just for you to ask certain questions,
###62 serious questions about a serious topic.
###65 I'm your host and moderator tonight, Dr. Janice Collins.
###68 Welcome to everyone, thank you for coming.
###70 The earthquake in Japan has reminded us all that disaster
###73 can strike us at any time and in many ways that
###76 we can hardly imagine.
###78 And while we in central Illinois may not be at risk
###81 for a tsunami, we do share one thing in common with
###84 our friends in Japan.
###86 We depend on nuclear power to generate a substantial portion
###89 of our electrical power.
###91 And with the benefits there comes risk.
###94 According to the Nuclear Energy Institute,
###95 almost 48 percent of Illinois' electricity
###98 is generated by nuclear power.
###101 Illinois is home to 10 active nuclear power plants with
###103 at least 4 with the same design as the Fukushima plant that was
###108 damaged by the earthquake, tsunami,
###109 and the power outage that resulted.
###112 Most of the plants operate in the northern portion
###114 of the state but on the Clinton--as far as the
###117 Clinton nuclear power plant that's located less than 80
###120 miles away from Charleston--it must be noted that it's 80
###125 miles away from Charleston and it does not have the
###128 same design as the Fukushima plants.
###131 We are here tonight to discuss what are the realistic risks of
###135 the radiation release from a nuclear power plant in Illinois
###138 and are we prepared to handle the emergency that could result.
###143 Joining me to help facilitate this conversation and to help
###146 answer your questions we are joined by Mr. Jonathon Monken,
###152 the Director of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency,
###155 and the IEMA is the agency responsible for coordinating
###161 the state's emergency response for a
###163 wide assortment of potential situations.
###166 Good evening and thank you for joining us.
###167 (Mr. Jonathon Monken). Good evening, my pleasure,
###168 thanks for having me.
###170 (Dr. Collins). Dr. Steven Daniels,
###171 Chair of the Physics Department and full professor at
###173 Eastern Illinois University who is well versed
###176 in how nuclear power is generated and the effects
###179 that radiation can have on humans and the environment.
###182 We want to thank you graciously for agreeing
###184 to assist us at the last minute.
###186 Thank you so much.
###187 (Dr. Steven Daniels). Thank you.
###188 (Dr. Collins). Mr. Cameron Craig is a
###189 well-known geology professor at Eastern Illinois University who
###193 is an expert on weather and the environment.
###196 Good evening and thank you for joining us.
###198 (Mr. Cameron Craig). Good evening, thank you.
###199 (Dr. Collins). And then finally
###200 we'd also like to welcome, in our audience,
###202 Mr. Pat Goodwin, the Charleston Fire Chief
###206 and the person responsible for developing and overseeing
###208 the city's emergency response team.
###212 Thank you, sir, for joining us.
###213 Welcome to everyone, welcome to us all.
###216 Let's go ahead and get started, this is a huge topic.
###220 I guess I first want to ask, the first question is, well,
###227 I could ask are we safe but to make sure that we have an
###231 understanding, can you describe just for the audience and
###235 for the listeners and the viewers how the Fukushima plant
###238 was designed and how the problem evolved
###241 so we're all on the same page before we begin the discussion.
###247 (Mr. Monken). Basically what we've seen--
###248 and information is limited unfortunately,
###250 as far as how much detail we're getting from Japan at
###253 this point to find out exactly what the significant damage
###256 was, what the critical damage was that ultimately caused it.
###259 But as you mentioned,
###260 there are some similarities in the designs.
###262 Really what you're looking at is just the inner containment
###264 facility is what's similar, which is the GE Mark 1.
###267 So the overall plant itself, there are actually
###269 some very significant differences.
###271 Ultimately, over the course of the last 30 or 40 years that
###273 these nuclear power plants in Illinois have been operational,
###276 there have been significant upgrades that have been made
###278 to the facilities, multiple alterations and expansions
###281 that have happened, that have really changed the system here
###284 that you would find in the plants as compared to
###286 what you saw in Japan.
###287 But ultimately, based on the information that we have
###289 available, what we've seen is that it
###291 really wasn't the earthquake that ultimately caused
###293 the situation that they have at the Fukushima plant.
###296 It actually withstood that earthquake fairly well.
###300 Ultimately, the problem was the following tsunami
###302 as you mentioned before.
###304 Now obviously the magnitude of both instances, both emergencies
###307 was far beyond anything that they had planned on.
###310 But ultimately what the tsunami did was,
###313 it knocked out the back-up power supplies to the plant.
###316 As ironic as this sounds, a nuclear power plant
###318 needs electricity in order to function,
###321 so it cannot run by itself.
###323 So ultimately what happened is, the system shut down by itself
###326 as it's supposed to do.
###328 The reactor shut itself down in response to
###330 the initial earthquake.
###332 Ultimately what happened is when the tsunami came in, a 40-foot
###335 tidal wave basically wiped out their back-up diesel generators.
###339 And that's something that all the power plants in the state of
###341 Illinois have, you have a redundant back-up diesel
###344 generating system to make sure that the plant
###346 never fully loses power.
###348 Well in this case it actually knocked out all of the
###350 backup power and, arguably just as significant,
###353 it knocked out all of the backup fuel.
###355 Whereas in Illinois we have all of our fuel,
###358 basically the diesel fuel is stored underground,
###361 there it was stored above ground.
###362 And when the tsunami came in it knocked out the generators and
###365 all of the fuel, and they were ultimately unable to
###367 restore power directly to the plant in order to get the
###370 coolant flowing through what's called the spent fuel pool.
###373 So after the draining rods are used for power generation
###377 they are removed from the core and
###378 placed in what is called a spent fuel pool.
###380 That's incredibly hot.
###382 And as it happens--and the really, really unfortunate
###385 timing is--those spent fuel rods had just been removed within
###389 months of this disaster happening, and those
###391 take somewhere between 12 and 15 years to cool down.
###395 So they'd only been out for a couple of months.
###397 If you can't get coolant through the spent fuel pool,
###399 that's actually where we're getting radiation from,
###401 not the inner core, but these spent rods that
###403 were already used for electricity.
###405 (Dr. Collins). Okay, and thank you
###407 for that explanation.
###410 Spinning off of just the last part of the radiation, talk a
###414 little bit about the effects of the radiation, containing the
###417 radiation, because at the very beginning when it first happened
###420 the reports were we don't have to worry about it.
###424 We're all the way in Illinois, but we're starting to see, we've
###427 already seen the creeping in of certain elements of radiation in
###433 our water and our plants and our air supply.
###435 Can you tell me a little bit about radiation, what that
###437 means, but also what does that mean for our environment and
###440 for the humans here.
###445 (Dr. Daniels). Radiation, the deal is that
###449 we get radiation all the time.
###451 It's coming from cosmic rays it's coming from background in
###454 the soil, it's coming from everywhere.
###456 We get a little bit all the time but nonetheless, the sense is
###462 that any radiation is still going to harm the body.
###465 It has some damage to cells almost no matter what.
###470 So the question is how much can you take.
###473 When we're talking about these trace amounts we're
###475 talking about amounts that are lower than the background,
###480 or basically around the background level.
###481 We're not talking about amounts that are going
###483 to be significantly dangerous.
###486 However, if the coolant and the waste fuel,
###494 that stuff is very hot, and it is hot enough that it would
###497 be a significant danger to a person right there.
###501 But here we are halfway around the world, it's going to be much
###503 dilute by the time it gets here, if any of it.
###507 Even though it has gotten here it's at much lower levels,
###511 so the danger to humans at this point is probably pretty low,
###515 at least in Illinois.
###517 (Dr. Collins). Okay, so that's good.
###519 Yes, professor.
###520 (Mr. Craig). When you talk about the
###522 atmospheric concepts here that, you know,
###524 Fukushima creates its own heat
###527 and so it creates its own low pressure.
###529 And so all that radiation gets into the upper atmosphere and
###531 is carried by the jet stream over North America.
###535 Over time it is dispersed so it's not as concentrated,
###542 so it does eventually fall from the sky.
###544 It's like, you know, we have dust storms in the Great Plains.
###547 The dust gets picked up, carried by the jet stream, and
###549 lands here in the Midwest, so it is the same kind of thing,
###552 but it's minute, it's very traceable.
###557 (Mr. Monken). And if I may add to that,
###558 ultimately what we found is obviously,
###559 we have detection systems throughout the state of
###561 Illinois that ultimately, that's how we identify
###564 and we take these samples on a regular basis,
###566 whether there is a disaster globally or not.
###569 In this particular case what we've identified as an isotope
###571 is iodine 131.
###573 And iodine 131 is not, obviously in large quantities or heavy
###577 doses or things like that, it's 10 percent gamma and
###580 gamma is what you need to be concerned with.
###583 Ultimately that's where you have the biggest risk involved, but
###585 what we have detected here--as you mentioned we've detected it
###588 on grass, we've detected it in the air--what we have detected
###592 is more than 2,000 times below the level at which
###596 there would be any amount of concern.
###599 And ultimately as an isotope it only has a half-life of 8 days
###601 which is good because it's not really persistent,
###604 it's something that will go away very quickly.
###607 (Dr. Collins). Okay, so then are you
###609 saying that we don't, because it's so small and it's diluted
###612 in its travel, we don't have to
###614 worry about these levels rising?
###618 (Mr. Monken). Certainly not,
###619 unless there was actually an additional source of
###621 radiation or something more significant.
###623 All radiological disasters from this perspective are
###626 rated on a scale of one to seven.
###628 So what we've seen at Fukushima is something similar to what we
###631 saw at Three Mile Island three decades ago,
###634 which is a level five.
###636 Something bigger than that is something like Chernobyl,
###638 which is a level seven, where actually the inner core of a
###641 nuclear power plant is exposed, which
###643 is fortunately, thankfully, not what we saw at Fukushima.
###647 (Mr. Craig). And distance is a big deal, too.
###649 When you consider Chernobyl that's half a world away,
###652 you know, as far as the jet stream is concerned, because of
###655 the westerly winds, everything comes from the west,
###661 and so it gets diluted over time.
###664 (Dr. Collins). Okay, okay, great.
###665 That's really interesting and an absolute easy way
###670 to understand it.
###671 I wish we had it during our news breaks and our news packages.
###674 We could all put that in one
###675 one-and-a-half-minute package there.
###679 Let's, you know, we're dealing with the unknown.
###683 I want to move a little bit toward "what if", okay.
###688 I want to understand and ask how do you prepare for the unknown,
###695 because things are happening and occurring that are not natural.
###701 Whether it's man-made, whether it's just nature,
###706 it's unpredictable.
###708 So I want to know and ask, how do you prepare for the unknown.
###712 Are we prepared for even an earthquake?
###716 If something were to happen with our plants,
###719 since we have so many, are we still protected?
###722 Let's say the unknown, the unthinkable, the impossible
###725 actually happens, as we continue to see globally.
###729 So I'll ask the first question.
###731 Are we prepared for the unknown, and if so, how are we prepared?
###738 (Mr. Monken). I guess what you
###739 probably did with that comment is
###742 you completely encapsulated what my entire job entails.
###745 [panel laughter].
###750 So thank you for doing an excellent job of really
###752 articulating what it is that I actually am charged to do for
###754 the state of Illinois, which is prepare for
###756 those types of things that you can't prepare for.
###759 So really the mandate for IEMA is to cover,
###761 it's just like FEMA, I mean,
###763 that's what we do at the state level is we cover,
###765 as we describe it, everything from terrorists to tornadoes
###767 and everything in between, so any type of disaster,
###769 whether it's man-made or it's natural.
###772 So as you mentioned, there are many things that can actually
###774 threaten the state of Illinois, and something that people don't
###777 often realize is that we actually sit very close
###779 to a major fault line.
###782 In this case, it's the New Madrid fault
###783 and the Wabash fault.
###785 And as it happens, for the last two-and-a-half years, we've
###788 been preparing for what's called a national level exercise.
###791 It's run by FEMA and at this point, includes nine states
###794 participating in it and we're actually simulating a
###797 7.7-magnitude earthquake on the New Madrid fault line.
###801 (Dr. Collins). And this is 250 miles
###802 away, that's where we are?
###803 (Mr. Monken). That's correct.
###804 Yeah, we're about 250 miles away from the epicenter.
###806 New Madrid, Missouri is technically the center of mass,
###809 if you will, for that particular fault line.
###812 And those are the types of things that we have to consider.
###814 Now, as you mentioned before, there's actually
###816 6 nuclear power plants with 11 active reactors, as far as the
###822 nuclear power generation in the state of Illinois.
###824 The closest one to a fault line is actually the one that you
###826 mentioned which is Clinton, which is about 250 miles
###829 from that fault line.
###831 And that's obviously why we're exercising the way
###833 we're exercising now is to simulate what would be the
###836 impact of something like that.
###838 Ultimately what we have to do is we have to try and come up with
###841 the most unexpected things that you can imagine,
###844 I mean, that's really what we're designed for.
###847 So that's why we continue to plan, rehearse, drill, and we
###849 try and look at things that either haven't happened before
###853 or, when you look at the case of the New Madrid fault line,
###856 we're actually on the 200th anniversary of the last
###860 major earthquake on that fault line,
###862 which was in 1811 and 1812, and it was powerful enough that
###866 it actually reversed the flow of the Mississippi River and
###869 rang church bells in Boston.
###871 That's a pretty significant earthquake if you're looking at
###873 the impact and obviously I won't get too far into the science
###876 because I'm not the expert--as you mentioned,
###879 there's no "Dr." at the beginning of my name.
###881 [panel laughter].
###883 But Japan in one respect was fortunate simply because you're
###887 really talking about whether or not this magnitude of earthquake
###890 travels through rock versus what you see here in Illinois,
###892 which is much looser soil.
###895 (Dr. Collins). That can be a challenge,
###897 right, that could be one of the challenges.
###898 (Mr. Monken). Right, and I would say that
###899 we are as prepared as we could possibly be
###901 for those types of events.
###903 We actually drill every six months at each of the power
###906 plants, so we rotate through between the six power plants.
###908 So basically, what it comes out to is every six months we're
###912 doing a nuclear response exercise at one of those plants.
###916 (Dr. Collins). Okay.
###918 (Mr. Craig). You said 7 magnitude
###920 on the Richter scale.
###922 Why is that the magic number?
###924 (Mr. Monken). Ultimately, that was the
###925 closest estimate that we had of what happened in 1811 and 1812,
###928 is they estimated between a 7 and an 8 magnitude
###931 on the Richter scale, which obviously
###933 is only one dimension of what you have to consider
###935 when you look at an earthquake.
###937 What you're really looking for is the g-force of the actual
###940 impact of the earthquake, or the ground speed.
###943 And that's what was so significant in Japan,
###944 why it resulted in such a humongous tsunami is that
###948 the g-forces created by the earthquake were
###950 orders of magnitude beyond anything in recorded history.
###954 So that's ultimately what created the biggest problem.
###957 So you can have a 7.7-magnitude earthquake that actually doesn't
###961 do a whole lot of damage, or you can actually have something
###964 like you did in New Zealand where you have a 6.2-magnitude
###967 earthquake that does horrific damage because that was
###970 the second most powerful earthquake in recorded history.
###973 (Mr. Craig). So in preparation for a 9,
###977 would there be any, you know, because there's been some
###980 concern that some of the reactors here in
###983 the United States are at 7, but we have 9.
###988 (Dr. Daniels). It's my understanding that
###990 Fukushima was designed for 8, and all the Japanese ones are
###994 designed for 8 because that was the biggest recorded,
###998 so they were covered according to what might have worked,
###1001 but then something comes along that's even bigger than that.
###1004 (Mr. Monken). That's exactly right.
###1005 They were designed to withstand a magnitude of 8.0 earthquake
###1008 and a 30-foot tsunami, so what they got was
###1011 a 42-foot tsunami and a 9.0 earthquake.
###1015 (Dr. Daniels). An important point is that
###1017 the difference between 8 and 9 is a factor of 10.
###1019 One's 10 times stronger.
###1021 The 9 is 10 times stronger than the 8, so that's a lot.
###1026 (Mr. Craig). And on top of that, the
###1028 tsunami--33-foot--they had prepared.
###1031 Over 30 years they built walls to protect themselves from
###1034 tsunamis but because of the tectonics, that whole coast line
###1039 dropped 3 meters and so it allowed water to spill over.
###1045 (Dr. Collins). Okay, so even though--and I want
###1047 to ask this question, then I'm going to ask Chief Goodwin
###1049 if he will, to step to the mic because I did want
###1051 to ask you--or have the mic brought to him--but I did want
###1054 to ask about the local response in the next question or so.
###1060 So am I to understand that because we're not under the
###1064 threat of a tsunami, even though we have reactors that have the
###1070 same design, that we really don't have the same concern
###1074 because we really don't have to worry about the tsunami?
###1078 So we can handle an earthquake, but because the tsunami that you
###1082 said was really what pushed it over, we're still okay, we're
###1086 going to be okay?
###1088 (Mr. Monken). I would tell you no matter what,
###1090 I mean, I can tell you that each of the plants here in Illinois
###1092 were designed basically to withstand the threats
###1094 that are most significant to them.
###1096 So earthquakes is certainly one, but obviously some of
###1099 the distance involved helps insulate those,
###1101 and there's a reason why Clinton is the farthest south that any
###1103 nuclear power plant was constructed in Illinois.
###1106 But obviously, we have other things to be concerned with.
###1108 We have floods as an issue--there's a plant in
###1111 Quad Cities right along the Mississippi River.
###1113 Tornadoes are obviously a concern.
###1115 In Virginia, we just saw that within the last 36 hours they
###1119 actually had a tornado wipe out power to that power plant and
###1123 they're operating on backup diesel generators right now.
###1125 So you bring up a good point that even if we don't have
###1130 an earthquake of the magnitude, or let's say we do but we don't
###1133 have a tsunami threat, I think what this has taught
###1136 a lot of people, especially in my line of work, is that
###1140 you absolutely have to kind of throw out the book
###1142 on what you think is the worst-case scenario.
###1145 So in my conversations with the governor, talking about this
###1148 because this is obviously something significant
###1150 in his mind, is you actually have to start
###1153 playing the "what if" game, just like you said.
###1155 What if there was an earthquake and a flood and a tornado,
###1158 and they all happened simultaneously?
###1160 Those are the types of preparations that you have to
###1162 make in order to insure that all those plants are safe and that
###1167 we have a response that fits those types of needs.
###1169 (Dr. Collins). Okay, and let's move to then,
###1172 from the state to the local.
###1174 Chief Goodwin, I wanted to ask you,
###1176 let's say the unthinkable does happen.
###1179 What do we have in place?
###1181 Do we have procedures and processes in place so that
###1186 we're ready for the unknown because you also, sir, have to
###1190 prepare for the unknown as well, correct?
###1193 We've prepared as much as we can.
###1194 You say the unknown, what is the unknown?
###1198 We can prepare for what we can do.
###1201 We've got the NIMS training throughout
###1203 the city and throughout the county, which is
###1204 the National Incident Management System, so we're all on the
###1206 same page on the incident.
###1209 Charleston and Coles County and most of Illinois belongs to a
###1211 MABAS organization--that's a Mutual Aid Box Alarm System.
###1216 It started in northern Illinois years ago, it's covered the
###1218 state of Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Indiana now.
###1223 It's the same system that when we went to New Orleans,
###1226 when they needed help,
###1227 Illinois sent a task force down--that's through MABAS.
###1231 Charleston here, mainly composed of Charleston firefighters and
###1235 Mattoon firefighters, have the technical rescue teams and
###1238 also the HAZMAT team for this part of Illinois.
###1241 We cover a huge part of southern and central Illinois.
###1246 With that, we are prepared as much as we can,
###1248 we have some highly trained individuals.
###1251 You talk about the dispense of the technical rescue and HAZMAT.
###1255 All Charleston fire and police vehicles have
###1257 radiation detectors in them that are going any time the
###1259 vehicles are on the streets.
###1261 You talk about the radiation, there's two to four millirads in
###1267 the background just driving around towns now so it's out
###1271 there but we're prepared as much as we can be.
###1274 With the MABAS though, we can call in resources.
###1278 We have potentially four states at our hand.
###1282 With one phone call I can request whatever resources
###1285 I need, with one phone call they will deploy them and have them
###1288 here within a few hours.
###1290 (Dr. Collins). Great, great answer.
###1292 Good, very complete answer.
###1293 What I'd like to do is take a short break.
###1295 We've talked a little bit about how it all started in Japan.
###1299 There are other areas that we may have to consider that are
###1302 a little closer to us than Japan and the effects of if something
###1305 happened there--would we really be ready for all of this?
###1309 So I want to take a short break and we'll be right back with
###1312 questions from the audience and continue our discussion on the
###1316 nuclear reaction and safety of Illinois.
###1320 [no dialogue].
###1324 (Dr. Collins). Okay, great, thank you so much.
###1328 Welcome back, welcome back, everyone.
###1332 I wanted to ask one quick question
###1333 before we go to the audience.
###1335 When we talk about nuclear safety, I wanted to ask
###1338 how is it outlined basically?
###1340 Can you tell us a little bit more about that, please?
###1342 (Mr. Monken). Sure, yeah, the Illinois
###1343 Department of Nuclear Safety has actually been around
###1344 for several decades and it was beefed up significantly
###1347 following the Three Mile Island incident because those types
###1350 of questions, the questions that we're asking right now,
###1352 those were questions that were raised at that time.
###1354 And there was a significant investment made by the state of
###1356 Illinois to really develop what is now really the premier
###1360 nuclear safety program in the country.
###1363 So we have several systems that are actually
###1364 unique to Illinois that no one else actually has.
###1367 One of them is called a resident inspector program,
###1369 where our department actually has third-party independent
###1373 radiological inspectors that actually work at each of these
###1376 plants, so we actually have a triple redundant system.
###1380 The company that owns them, Exelon,
###1381 they have their own resident inspectors.
###1383 The NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, they have them.
###1386 What's unique to Illinois is we actually have a third tier of
###1387 inspectors that actually work for IEMA and
###1390 conduct inspections at those plants.
###1393 We also have something called the remote monitoring system.
###1395 We take data from more than a thousand sensors in each of the
###1400 plants, and we can actually collect and interpret all that
###1404 data in real time, so we will actually know if there is an
###1407 incident inside the plant before the company actually knows it.
###1411 And all of this is centered around a program called REAC,
###1414 which is actual physical location in the
###1416 State Emergency Operations Center that collects all this
###1418 data 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in real time and
###1421 actually represents it graphically for our personnel.
###1425 And the last thing is an actual part of the remote monitoring
###1427 system, is gaseous detectors that are
###1430 actually surrounding each of the power plants.
###1433 So, at a radius of 2 miles around each of the plants,
###1435 they collect--24 hours a day, 7 days a week--
###1438 they collect data so we can actually tell if there is a
###1441 radiological leak or a leak of radiation
###1443 from any of the plants.
###1444 We can tell which direction it's going, how significant it is,
###1447 what types of isotopes we're looking at,
###1449 which is very unique.
###1450 There's no one else in the country that has that.
###1452 (Dr. Collins). Great points, good to know.
###1455 And also I think it's important for us to mention that Exelon is
###1459 the owner of these reactors, correct?
###1462 (Mr. Monken). That's right.
###1463 (Dr. Collins). All of them, so I think that's
###1465 important in your narrative there.
###1467 Thank you so much.
###1468 We're going to take a question from the audience,
###1470 or a statement.
###1471 Sir if you would step straight to the mic and pull
###1473 the mic down a little bit so we can hear what you're saying.
###1476 (Dr. Alan Baharlou). I can hold it.
###1477 (Dr. Collins). Okay.
###1478 [laughter].
###1480 (Dr. Baharlou). I'm Alan Baharlou.
###1481 I'm a geochemist.
###1483 First of all, yes, New Madrid moved 200 years ago and
###1487 because of that the tension is building around it.
###1491 [unclear audio].
###1495 And it just moved like the San Andreas fault.
###1498 And that would be devastating--shock, travel.
###1503 It's there at any moment.
###1508 Two, all this nuclear waste that we have has, Steve knows,
###1514 plutonium and plutonium radiates alpha and alpha penetrates
###1520 anything--you need only one atom.
###1522 It goes through the body, goes through the membrane of the
###1525 cell, goes through the nucleus and damages the regulatory gene.
###1530 The regulatory gene goes berserk and that's what cancer is.
###1536 It's not like solar radiation, radiation from your lamp.
###1540 Steve knows, highly penetrative.
###1543 You only need one atom.
###1545 You cannot see it, cannot taste it, you cannot smell it.
###1551 And all of this nuclear waste, which is now stored at the
###1556 nuclear power plant in the pool, we don't know where to take it,
###1560 where to dispose of it.
###1563 There is a place, Yucca Mountain, supposedly.
###1566 If that ever happens, all this waste will travel to American
###1570 highways from east to west.
###1574 All you need is one accident.
###1577 So, in other words and the fourth, an airplane could crash
###1581 in any of these nuclear power plants, so I don't want us
###1585 to be pessimistic but I'll finish my statement.
###1589 When Einstein discovered E=MC2--that statement- he said,
###1594 the unleashed power of the atom has changed everything
###1599 except our way of thinking,
###1601 thus we drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.
###1605 (Dr. Collins). Okay, thank you sir.
###1607 So, Dr. Daniels, you were called out by name,
###1611 we're going to let you respond to that.
###1612 (Dr. Daniels). Okay, well first of all,
###1615 there are three main types of radiation that we consider.
###1618 There's alpha, beta and gamma.
###1620 The alpha particle is basically helium with high energy.
###1625 The beta particle is basically an electron
###1628 and the gamma particle is a photon with high energy.
###1632 The alpha particles will basically be
###1634 stopped by a piece of paper.
###1636 Because they are so massive and so large,
###1639 they're very easy to stop.
###1642 However, if they get inside your body, they get stopped by your
###1645 body and, therefore, they can do significant damage that way.
###1650 So it's when you ingest alpha emitters that
###1655 that can have the most damage there.
###1658 The beta emitters can go a few centimeters, a few tenths of a
###1661 centimeter, so they would go inside your skin.
###1664 They can actually start to harm your body, but it's the gammas
###1667 that actually go through you and can impact deep tissue.
###1674 (Dr. Collins). Now, okay, I'm not a physicist
###1676 or any of those "icists."
###1679 I just wanted to ask though, is that one of the reasons why our
###1684 first point of attack or defense was in the air, in the water
###1689 supply, in the plants--things that we can ingest--is that why
###1693 we've been looking and monitoring those particular
###1698 elements every six months, as you say?
###1701 (Mr. Monken). Absolutely, I mean, really,
###1702 that's the best way to tell and a lot of times--and you
###1706 can certainly expand on this quite a bit--there can be
###1710 significant inconsistencies just in areas of the state.
###1712 Northern Illinois versus southern Illinois--it's a large
###1714 geographic area.
###1715 So when we take air samples from northern Illinois and air
###1718 samples from southern Illinois or grass samples--and
###1721 we also do milk, we do fish, we do water, all of these types of
###1724 things--we test them on a regular basis.
###1726 This is something we did long before anything happened to
###1729 Japan, but that's why you have to test all areas
###1731 of the state--because there are a lot of environmental factors
###1734 that could actually cause certain things to go to certain
###1737 places where you wouldn't see it.
###1738 But that's exactly why we test it because that's
###1740 the air you breathe, it's the grass you walk on,
###1743 it's the fish that you eat, it's the milk that you drink--those
###1746 are the types of things that we need to be able to check.
###1748 (Dr. Collins). Okay, well, let me ask this.
###1751 From an environmental point of view then,
###1754 because one of the things that we haven't been able to control,
###1757 one of the things that we haven't been able to say is
###1759 "this is what we have in place and this is how we can measure".
###1761 Are the elements that can actually drive up these levels,
###1765 such as the wind, the water, the river--I mean,
###1770 maybe I'm looking at it a little differently, but I'm
###1772 looking at it critically now and I have this question.
###1776 Since we're sitting on the Mahomet Aquifer, right--the
###1781 largest body of fresh water in the country--could any release
###1785 reach that source of water and what would be the effect?
###1789 (Mr. Craig). Yeah, if you have a meltdown
###1791 it's definitely going to cause a serious issue.
###1794 If you have a leak in the suppression containment then it
###1798 gets into the water system and then we're all drinking it,
###1801 but it's not just us that is going to be impacted,
###1805 it's going to be all vegetation from the ground level.
###1810 Atmospherically, you have heat that's billowing should
###1814 a disaster occur and then what
###1815 happens is--we're surrounded by winds.
###1818 (Dr. Collins). Absolutely, with flat.
###1823 (Mr. Craig). And so all that radiation
###1825 would transfer quickly, especially with storms.
###1829 And so radiation gets into the clouds, you
###1831 have a huge storm system that naturally occurs,
###1835 but then it starts dumping the precipitation back into the soil
###1839 and so contaminating it doubly.
###1841 (Dr. Collins). So that's my concern.
###1843 When you say that, and we're looking at a flat terrain here,
###1846 and we can't really control the wind.
###1848 So then, therefore, I'm looking at, if that's the case, are we
###1853 prepared or do we have filters in place of some sort or how are
###1859 we preparing or protecting ourselves?
###1860 (Mr. Craig). The big question is
###1862 how much education has there been to educate the community.
###1868 That's the big question.
###1869 I haven't heard anything, I didn't even know that
###1871 Illinois had nuclear power plants until Fukushima.
###1875 (Dr. Collins). Really?
###1876 (Mr. Craig). Yeah.
###1877 (Dr. Collins). Okay, well I guess it may
###1878 not come up in regular conversation until
###1880 something like that happens.
###1881 (Mr. Craig). You're right until something
###1882 actually does happen, so.
###1883 (Dr. Collins). Yeah but that's good to
###1884 know though, it's important to know.
###1885 (Mr. Monken). I think you're absolutely right.
###1887 What it comes down to is education and we run into this,
###1890 it doesn't matter what type of natural disaster
###1892 you're talking about.
###1893 Whether you're talking about earthquakes--which people in
###1895 Illinois typically just don't understand, or how to respond
###1897 to them or what they would do in the case of an earthquake.
###1899 The last thing you should do in an earthquake is run out of
###1902 a building because you have to worry about the debris.
###1904 That's something that a lot of people just don't realize
###1906 because people in Illinois aren't used to it.
###1908 But really I think the educational piece is very
###1910 important to understand what types of radiation there are,
###1913 how it is naturally occurring.
###1915 You know radiation is released from the soil when it rains--you
###1917 know those types of things--but I think the last part of it is
###1921 information is the most critical piece of what you're looking at.
###1925 So if you look at a plant like Fukushima, they don't have a
###1928 system of sensors that are actually around each of the
###1930 plants like we do in Illinois.
###1932 That is, we designed that system specifically because of what
###1936 happened at Three Mile Island.
###1938 They didn't know how much radiation, they didn't know
###1940 which way it was headed, they didn't know, you know,
###1943 they could look at the wind currents but they didn't
###1944 understand exactly where the radiation was going.
###1947 And that's why we have the system of sensors that we do
###1949 and that's why we take the samples that we do on a regular
###1952 basis to make sure if we can detect the patterns,
###1954 we can detect the intensity level, the saturation level,
###1958 all those types of things, which I think is the
###1960 most important part of responding to them.
###1962 (Dr. Collins). Okay, thank you,
###1962 Dr. Daniels you wanted to say.
###1964 (Dr. Daniels). If I can give a little
###1965 perspective here, I was about 80 miles downwind
###1968 of Three Mile Island when it happened.
###1970 And the first thing we did was we put a detector out the
###1974 window--a radiation detector--and over
###1977 the next three days the detector went from background level
###1980 to twice background level and stayed there
###1982 for about two weeks.
###1984 Now how much danger is that, just to put it in perspective,
###1989 walking past the radiology department in a hospital was
###1993 more radiation than that--
###1995 (Dr. Collins). Oh wow.
###1996 (Dr. Daniels). --for the average person
###1998 and taking airplane flights you get more radiation than that.
###2004 (Dr. Collins). Something else to
###2005 worry about now, airplane flights, oh my goodness.
###2007 (Dr. Daniels). Well the point is
###2009 that the background level is fairly low and
###2011 when something as major as Three Mile Island happens
###2016 even at that, it wasn't really contaminating all
###2019 the atmosphere, everywhere, all the time.
###2022 It was a fairly major event but at the same level it didn't
###2026 really impact even 80 miles away, it didn't change the
###2031 way people had to worry about radiation.
###2034 [Dr. Baharlou]. Could you please explain
###2035 half-life and dose limit, [unclear audio].
###2041 (Dr. Collins). So he's asking about half-life
###2043 for the listeners and the viewers out there
###2045 in the audience and the TV audience.
###2047 He wants you to explain, Dr. Daniels, half-life.
###2050 (Dr. Daniels). Okay, so a radioactive
###2052 material will give off so much radiation as in terms of a rate,
###2057 maybe some number of decays per second.
###2061 Over time that material will disappear, if you start with
###2066 say a thousand grams of something and
###2069 it decays well it's going away and it takes
###2074 exactly one-half life for half of that material to go away.
###2078 But the interesting thing is that then now you have 500 grams
###2082 of the material and you wait one-half life
###2085 for that to go away too.
###2087 It doesn't all go away in two half lives,
###2089 it only half goes away at any given half life.
###2091 (Dr. Baharlou). Would you give an example
###2093 of half-life of Uranium?
###2096 (Dr. Daniels). Half-life of Uranium--
###2098 I believe it's in the millions of years.
###2100 (Dr. Baharlou). 404.5 million years so again,
###2105 as I said, unleashed power of the atom has changed everything.
###2110 This is not like any other thing, it's there for eternity
###2114 so we have to be concerned about that
###2116 and would you also speak about dose limit.
###2120 (Dr. Collins). Okay and what I'm
###2121 going to ask you, sir, those are great questions and
###2123 I'd love for everyone to make sure that they
###2124 see you, so if you have a string of questions please feel free to
###2127 go to the microphone so we can have that.
###2131 (Dr. Collins). Okay very good,
###2132 I just wanted to make sure, very good thank you, okay.
###2137 Dr. Daniels, please.
###2138 (Dr. Daniels). Well this is probably
###2139 more like John's specialty than mine but again
###2144 we measure how much radiation you take in and
###2146 the more radiation you get, the more dangerous it's going to be.
###2151 But typically the IEMA and the NRC have set limits of how much
###2158 the public can get and how much workers in the industry can get
###2161 and various levels that that can be and
###2163 they're in the millirem I believe.
###2165 (Mr. Monken). That's right.
###2166 (Dr. Daniels). So I'll let you talk about that.
###2168 (Mr. Monken). Absolutely, yeah so
###2169 the maximum as I mentioned before
###2171 when we had detected the iodine 131, which is what everybody
###2174 has been picking up as a result of the disaster in Fukushima.
###2177 Ultimately we're looking at it is in the millirem so we're at
###2181 the point, what we're detecting right now is one-two thousandth
###2184 of the level that would be necessary to actually have
###2188 an impact on public health in any way, shape or form.
###2191 It would actually cross the threshold of the dose level
###2193 that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would say
###2195 you have something to be concerned about.
###2197 So certainly not to be taken lightly by any
###2199 stretch of the imagination.
###2201 That being said it's also important from an
###2204 educational perspective to understand the orders in
###2206 magnitude of where we are.
###2208 It took us about two-and-a-half days of testing one sample to
###2213 actually detect the iodine 131 and you'll probably vouch for
###2217 the fact that you would never put a sample in something
###2220 for two-and-a-half days to find it.
###2222 If it's not detectable and something you can do
###2224 within a few hours it's something that's at such a
###2226 low level that you wouldn't even be concerned about.
###2229 (Dr. Collins). Okay great, thank you gentlemen.
###2230 We have a question from the audience, ma'am if you would
###2232 just step right up to the mic, there you go.
###2235 (Female Speaker). Yes, my name is [unclear audio]
###2237 I'm an EIU staff and a current mother of two EIU students.
###2242 I got a question regarding to information
###2244 that I did receive a while back,
###2247 The gentleman here said that the radiation is
###2250 dissipated as it travels from Japan to the United States.
###2254 What about the merchandise that is coming currently from Japan
###2258 such as vehicles, which I've been told that plutonium could
###2261 get into the vehicles and the seats and everywhere
###2266 and that stays there for a very long time.
###2268 We have a lot of merchandise coming currently from Japan.
###2271 How do you prevent all that merchandise and how does
###2274 corporate America deal with that loss of money.
###2277 What are they doing with that merchandise supposed to
###2279 arrive in the United States and
###2280 it's already contaminated with plutonium and other chemicals?
###2284 (Dr. Collins). That's a great question,
###2285 it is global isn't it.
###2287 We have to look at things outside of state lines.
###2289 (Mr. Craig). One of the things is that,
###2292 I buy rice, big bags of rice and I've been concerned.
###2296 The first thing that comes to mind is how long ago
###2298 was this harvested and how long did it sit in a warehouse and
###2302 I'm guessing that it's okay but the production of rice is
###2308 probably going to be a critical factor in the future
###2311 especially with other vegetation that we eat.
###2316 But as far as products are concerned I--
###2319 (Mr. Monken). Yeah, I can tell you
###2320 ultimately and this is actually kind of
###2322 interesting because there is a reason why all hazards
###2325 cover everything from man-made to natural.
###2327 In the post 9/11 world we actually have a much better
###2330 developed system of radiation detection as it applies
###2333 to customs and border protection.
###2335 So if you're looking at Japan as an example, they actually
###2338 import 60 percent of all the food the country consumes,
###2341 simply because there's not enough space and
###2343 there's 123 million people.
###2345 So the exports from a food perspective are
###2348 actually extremely low from Japan as it stands anyway.
###2351 That being said, ultimately there are some very, very
###2354 significant systems in place to detect even small trace amounts
###2359 of radiation on any passenger plane, on any cargo plane,
###2364 on any ship, or any vehicle
###2366 that crosses an international border.
###2368 So nothing can really get into the United States even with
###2370 minor trace levels of radiation
###2373 without being detected immediately upon arrival.
###2376 So people don't actually even realize that planes that you're
###2379 flying, if someone flies from Narita to O'Hare, you don't even
###2383 realize that that plane is actually scanned
###2385 for trace levels of radiation as it comes into the airport.
###2389 (Dr. Collins). Even with that though
###2390 there has to be or there appears even
###2393 when the news first broke we saw a dip in the Dow
###2396 and so there's going to be an economic effect globally.
###2400 Are we prepared for something like that?
###2402 Let's say it's great, we can detect certain small levels on
###2407 planes and modes of transportation,
###2409 but it can have an effect in the way that our state is right now,
###2413 it could really affect us harder and deeper and more intensely
###2418 than an earthquake if we're not very careful.
###2420 What do you think about that assessment?
###2422 (Mr. Monken). I think it's a
###2423 fantastic question simply because right now even the
###2425 estimated economic impact, it's the world's third largest
###2428 economy and you're talking about an estimated
###2430 economic impact of at least $330 billion.
###2434 That's just what Japan needs in order to recover, that says
###2437 nothing to the fact about the total net value lost in world
###2441 markets and things like that when you have
###2443 that type of impact.
###2445 You can even strike it close to home--Caterpillar,
###2446 which is headquartered in Peoria, Illinois,
###2448 has five facilities in Japan.
###2451 The question is whether or not they can export what they
###2454 continue to export because that's actually the regional hub
###2456 for Southeast Asia.
###2457 So the economic impact I think is going to be measured in a
###2461 dollar figure that I don't think any of us could possibly
###2464 wrap our minds around.
###2465 (Dr. Collins). Ok, yeah.
###2466 Well, okay, thank you for those responses.
###2470 I wanted to ask a question about the reactors--I wanted to come
###2473 back to that for just a moment.
###2475 Because I believe in the research it shows that they're
###2478 close to 25 years old, approximately.
###2481 (Mr. Monken). Actually, older.
###2482 (Dr. Collins). Older, okay.
###2484 So my question, my follow-up question is
###2487 have there been measures for improvement as far as
###2491 they're getting a little old?
###2492 Have we started taking steps to improve the defense?
###2496 (Mr. Monken). Yes, as I mentioned before
###2497 briefly but I'll kind of expand on right now,
###2500 you mentioned the similarities between the designs of some of
###2502 the plants that we have here in Illinois--specifically,
###2504 you're talking about the two reactors located at the Dresden
###2507 plant and two reactors located at the Quad Cities plant.
###2510 And the similarities are really most direct
###2514 when you're looking at the inner containment facility,
###2516 which is the GE mark-1.
###2518 The rest of the facility has changed drastically over the
###2520 course of time, because ultimately
###2522 significant improvements have been made
###2524 to each of those facilities as technology has increased.
###2527 So as the technology continues to get better, which
###2530 to a certain extent, we're kind of in the middle of what some
###2533 people would refer to as a nuclear renaissance as far as
###2535 the efficiency of nuclear power, the capability to produce it--
###2540 all those types of things--but there hasn't been a nuclear
###2541 power plant commission in the United States in over 20 years.
###2545 So what you're looking at is plants like the Quad Cities
###2547 and Dresden--Dresden just celebrated 40 years this year,
###2550 so it's a 40-year-old reactor right now.
###2554 That being said, over that span of time, significant
###2557 improvements have been made to the facility to make it more
###2559 efficient, to make it better at what it does, to make it safer
###2562 --all of those things have been done over time.
###2565 Now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had basically,
###2568 when they commissioned a new plant they gave them
###2569 a license for 40 years.
###2571 That 40-year license expired at Dresden this last year
###2574 and was renewed for an additional 20.
###2577 The expectation is that the Quad Cities will get
###2578 an additional 20 years next year, but really
###2581 the youngest power plant in the state of Illinois is at Clinton.
###2586 So, as it happens, the closest one to us is the
###2588 youngest facility in the state of Illinois, but youngest is
###2593 kind of a dubious honor at this point because
###2595 really you're talking it's over 30 years old.
###2598 So really you're looking at a lot of plants now
###2601 that have been on line for several decades.
###2607 (Dr. Collins). We've talked to Chief Goodwin
###2611 and asked his opinion and all the
###2613 wonderful measures that he has in place that appear to be,
###2617 that can be effective if something were to happen.
###2620 Let's make it even simpler.
###2622 If we were to have to power down a plant, are we prepared
###2626 for that and what measures would have to be in place
###2632 --are they in place if we just needed to quickly power down?
###2635 We see a lot of travesties that have occurred because the
###2640 safety elements didn't take on because they
###2643 weren't able to power down very quickly.
###2646 So where are we in that since we have 10?
###2650 Where are we as far as the powering down element?
###2652 (Mr. Monken). Sure, yeah, ultimately
###2654 the plants themselves are actually designed to respond
###2657 to an emergency by shutting down, but saying it's
###2662 shutting down is definitely not flipping the light switch.
###2664 [panel laughter].
###2665 I can tell you that it is significantly more complicated
###2667 than that process.
###2668 (Dr. Collins). And how long of a process is it?
###2670 (Mr. Monken). It's a very long process really
###2671 in a lot of respects because what you're looking at is
###2673 you've got whether or not it's actually actively functioning
###2677 as a reactor as versus whether or not there's still
###2680 radioactivity coming from the inner core and the
###2682 spent fuel pool and that's kind of two different things.
###2684 So if you look at the earthquake that we had in Illinois
###2686 just a couple years ago, which was a very low magnitude,
###2689 that actually caused the plants to shut down simply because if
###2692 there's seismic activity in the immediate area,
###2694 they'll automatically shut down right away.
###2697 But what we're talking about too is, you know like I said,
###2702 it's not like flipping off the light switch.
###2704 The other thing you need to be concerned with--and this is what
###2706 they saw in Japan--is, as I mentioned before, when you pull
###2708 that spent nuclear fuel out, which is something that was
###2711 raised, and very, very accurately raised
###2714 by the audience, when you pull those spent fuel rods out,
###2717 they're still radioactive --very, very radioactive.
###2721 And it takes a significant amount of time for them to
###2723 ultimately cool down where the atomic reactions are not
###2727 happening with the frequency or at the rate that puts out
###2730 the heat and radioactivity that actually causes the problem.
###2732 That takes 12 to 15 years.
###2734 (Dr. Collins). Wow.
###2736 (Mr. Monken). To put it in perspective,
###2737 when they have a spent fuel pool
###2739 ultimately before it can actually be transferred to
###2741 a low-level nuclear waste site, it takes about
###2744 12 to 15 years cooling down in water in order
###2747 to actually slow down the reactions enough that you're
###2750 taking away the harmful reaction that you're getting.
###2753 The first step though is making sure that the plant itself is
###2756 shut down because there are other issues that you can run
###2760 into if the plant is still fully functioning at the time.
###2763 (Mr. Craig). How much of the shut down
###2765 process is automated versus human-controlled?
###2769 (Mr. Monken). Really, the human element
###2771 is kind of the redundant element to it.
###2773 Most of it happens automatically,
###2776 and it's designed that way to make sure that
###2777 under no circumstances is it possible for--it cannot solely
###2781 rely on human error as you accurately identified.
###2786 The point is there is an automatic system that's in place
###2790 and then there's multiple redundant human systems
###2792 that are in place.
###2794 So you have the individuals who are physically at the plant,
###2795 then you also have agencies like IEMA who are actually monitoring
###2798 those plants, that actually have the
###2799 capability to do something as well.
###2801 So ultimately it's, you know, if you look at an aircraft, the
###2805 only way you can actually fly an aircraft is that it
###2807 actually has to have six redundant autopilot systems
###2810 on a commercial passenger airliner.
###2812 We take a very similar model.
###2814 You have to have multiple layers of redundant capability to
###2818 shut down those plants to make sure that
###2819 under no circumstances could it basically run wild.
###2822 (Dr. Collins). Okay, what I would like to do
###2824 is have Dr. Daniels make his comment then we're going to
###2828 take a short break to come back with some closing statements.
###2832 And I had one more serious question to ask before we have
###2835 the closing statements, but Dr. Daniels--
###2836 (Dr. Daniels). I have another question.
###2839 Going forward you have new fuel coming in all the time and it
###2845 takes 15 years to get rid of a piece of fuel.
###2847 How much do they change over the rods and, therefore,
###2851 how much is piling up?
###2853 (Mr. Monken). A lot of it just depends on,
###2854 right now what you're looking at is, you're looking at roughly
###2857 over 9,000 pounds of low-level nuclear waste that's
###2860 being stored somewhere in the state of Illinois
###2863 right now at each of the plants.
###2864 So, it's distributed between each of the plants,
###2866 even if it's inactive like the Zion plant that's
###2868 on the north shore of Chicago.
###2870 So it's a great question because that's a national concern.
###2874 That's not just an Illinois concern,
###2875 that's a national concern because ultimately you
###2877 cannot use those nuclear rods into perpetuity.
###2881 At some point, the level of the reaction is going to drop
###2884 to the point where it's not efficient as a power source.
###2886 So it's a constant process and it varies from plant to plant
###2890 as far as how long they run one set of rods
###2893 and then how long it's been since they've been taken out.
###2895 I mean, at any one of the plants you can see
###2896 the spent nuclear fuel pools contain rods that
###2899 have been out for varying lengths of time.
###2901 The real question that has to be asked at a national level is the
###2904 Yucca Mountain facility was supposed to be the
###2906 solution for low-level nuclear waste nationally.
###2908 Unfortunately, it's not open, so what's happening now is each of
###2913 the states are continuing to store low-level
###2915 nuclear waste on site at each of the power plants.
###2919 That's what Illinois has to do right now,
###2921 until a permanent solution is reached.
###2922 (Dr. Collins). Okay.
###2923 [audience member speaking].
###2924 (Dr. Collins). Hold that thought one moment.
###2928 Hold that one moment, sir.
###2930 We're going to come back with that question.
###2931 We're going to take a quick break with
###2932 "Issues and Attitudes: Nuclear Safety in Illinois".
###2935 [no dialogue].
###2939 (Dr. Collins). Great, welcome back to
###2940 "Issues and Attitudes: Nuclear Safety in Illinois".
###2944 The final question before we have our closing statements--
###2947 I wanted to ask about the "what if".
###2950 We've been talking a lot hypothetically
###2951 because we have to.
###2953 We're fortunate that we haven't had some of the tragedies that
###2956 have occurred in other countries.
###2958 But I want to ask about, we've talked about the environment,
###2962 we've talked about air supply, we've talked about water supply.
###2964 What about the actual evacuation of movement of people?
###2969 And what do they do, and what can they do?
###2972 Not necessarily what can they do on an individual basis,
###2974 but do we have plans and measures in place to actually
###2978 get the word out to the people, educate the audience
###2981 and actually get them out safely?
###2986 (Mr. Monken). I would say
###2987 the closer you live to a nuclear power plant,
###2989 the more you actually know about this process because
###2991 there's actually a requirement placed on how much information
###2994 we need to put out, and it's actually a
###2996 shared responsibility with Exelon who,
###2998 as you mentioned earlier, owns the plants.
###3000 But ultimately, I think you're hitting on
###3002 the critical piece here which is there are a lot of factors
###3005 that we cannot control that we have to monitor.
###3008 The human element is the only factor that
###3010 we actually can control, which is the evacuation plans
###3013 and everything else that we have because it can be probably
###3016 even more easily carried by people
###3018 than it can be by, really, natural elements.
###3021 (Mr. Craig). You know, most of the residents
###3022 here In Illinois are not used to evacuation on mass.
###3026 If I can ask the audience a simple question,
###3029 how many of you know what to do in a tornado?
###3032 Okay, how many of you know what to do in an earthquake?
###3037 What do you know how to do for a nuclear reaction?
###3044 Yeah, one.
###3050 But, that was my key point.
###3052 We all know about tornadoes but a nuclear reaction or disaster,
###3058 we don't.
###3059 (Dr. Collins). Okay, that is a different--
###3061 (Male speaker) [unclear audio].
###3075 (Dr. Collins). Okay, sir, I'm sorry.
###3076 If you'd like to ask--we can't hear you at all because you're
###3078 in the audience--If you'd like to stand to the microphone,
###3083 if we have time we'll get to that before we close.
###3086 That would be fine, but we just can't hear you.
###3091 (Mr. Monken). That evacuation plan is actually
###3093 what we spend the most amount of time actually practicing and
###3095 the Chief hit the nail on the head, which is,
###3097 through the mutual aid systems that we have throughout
###3099 the state of Illinois, that's exactly what we drill.
###3102 It's what we would need to do because
###3104 you can only educate the public so much.
###3106 At a certain point it actually takes the involvement of your
###3108 public safety entities, whether it's fire, EMT, or police.
###3111 Those are the people that we train on a regular basis
###3114 and we have very, very detailed evacuation plans for
###3116 every area of the state.
###3118 (Dr. Collins). Okay, thank you.
###3119 And let's move to Chief Goodwin,
###3121 who has offered some really valuable information.
###3126 I wanted him to have a moment to make a closing statement,
###3128 sir, before we move on.
###3130 (Mr. Goodwin). We have a specialized team
###3132 for this part of the state as far as HAZMAT and
###3134 technical rescue but as far as HAZMAT, if we do
###3136 get into the nuclear side of it, my second phone call is
###3139 going to be to IEMA for their assistance
###3142 because they're the experts in it.
###3143 But as far as the evacuation, we talked about that.
###3146 Charleston, we have an evacuation plan in place,
###3148 so we try to prepare for everything.
###3151 What's going to happen, who knows,
###3153 but we try to prepare for the worst that we know of.
###3155 (Dr. Collins). Thank you, sir.
###3157 Dr. Daniels.
###3160 (Dr. Daniels). Radiation is something that
###3162 you can't see, you can't smell, you can't feel,
###3164 but the key to protecting yourself and
###3168 understanding the whole thing is learning and education and we
###3172 need to understand, have the masses understand, exactly what
###3176 the dangers are and exactly how bad they are
###3178 or how not so bad they are.
###3179 (Dr. Collins). Okay, great, thank you.
###3180 Professor Craig.
###3181 (Mr. Craig). Nuclear plants are necessary and
###3185 they're very efficient--more efficient than wind power and
###3188 solar panels and so it's necessary, but again education
###3194 and understanding what to do
###3196 in the event of a situation is needed.
###3199 (Dr. Collins). Great and Mr. Monken.
###3202 (Mr. Monken). Really what I'd like to
###3204 really just kind of say about what we have in Illinois is
###3206 that I think the citizens of Illinois should be extremely
###3208 proud of the system that we actually have here.
###3211 In many respects, it's unique nationally and unique globally.
###3214 Representatives from 22 countries, including Japan,
###3216 have been to Illinois to see how
###3217 we do our nuclear safety program.
###3220 While it is really the best in the country-- incredibly well
###3223 developed and really better than anything anyone else has--
###3228 we always have to see these disasters
###3231 as an opportunity to improve our plans.
###3233 There's never a finish line.
###3235 There's never a point at which we are done making our plans--
###3239 how we're going to evacuate people, what types of
###3241 scenarios we need to be prepared for--and that's what these types
###3244 of events, that's why they're so important to us is that
###3247 we have to take a look back, rework our plans and
###3250 make sure that everything is as accurate as it can be.
###3253 (Dr. Collins). Okay, that's wonderful.
###3255 I wanted to also add to the education aspect--it is
###3257 important to be educated and I'm so happy, happy and pleased
###3261 to see everyone here who wanted to come out and ask questions
###3264 and hear some of the answers and actually continue
###3267 and participate in the dialogue.
###3269 I also want to mention April 28, right?
###3273 IEMA is having the Great Central U.S. Shakeout--
###3276 getting prepared for earthquakes.
###3278 That's going to be going on.
###3280 60,000 Illinois residents have already registered to
###3282 participate in an earthquake drill,
###3285 so we're really pleased about that.
###3286 So that's one part of getting educated.
###3288 Another part of getting educated is having guests such as
###3291 Professor Craig--thank you so much for being here;
###3294 Mr. Monken--thank you so much;
###3296 Dr. Daniels and Chief Goodwin,
###3298 thank you so much for being here.
###3299 [unclear audio].
###3303 (Dr. Collins). You're watching "Issues
###3304 and Attitudes", thank you everyone, for coming,
###3306 "Nuclear Safety in Illinois".
###3308 Have a great evening and goodnight.
