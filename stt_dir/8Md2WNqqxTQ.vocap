###30 it's truly amazing
###31 the number of conditions that respond favorably cannabis
###39 We are looking at an
###41 unexcelled wonder plant
###43 an herbal medicine that has
###46 no comparison
###49 It would appear that cannabis and hemp
###54 were one of the first plants grown in agriculture
###56 we came out of being hunters and gatherers at about ten thousand years ago
###60 and so that's at least the length of time a cannabis has been cultivated
###67 Cannabis
###70 has long been known
###72 aas a medicinal
###74 plant
###75 as a medicinal product
###77 the latest studies or the latest findings are
###80 a tomb in china in which the contents of the medicine bag of a medicine man
###86 were discovered one of the things it contained
###89 was cannabis
###91 The tomb was carbon dated as
###94 almost 5000 years old
###96 the conventional wisdom
###98 which goes to the oral history of china
###101 is that the emperor Shennong wrote first chinese materia medica
###107 and that it contained
###109 cannabis
###110 He is alleged to have written it in 2637 bc which would be
###115 almost 5000 years ago
###118 the oldest known copy of that goes back to some ranging about 100 bc and 100 ad
###123 100 bc and 100 ad
###125 the oldest actual written record of the
###127 use of cannabis as a medicine
###129 is found
###130 in the writings of the Indian as in been India ayurvedic medicine
###135 In which that
###136 a piece of  history is dated eight somewhere between 1100 bc
###141 and 1700 bc
###148 Cannabis is found in every major materia medica that has ever been written
###153 that includes the Ebers Medical Papyrus from Egypt
###160 It includes the writing of Dioscorides who was Niro's Doctor
###167 and
###168 his materia medica was used for over a  1000 years
###172 and it was included in the united states for pharacopeia
###176 from
###177 1854 until 1941
###181 Marijuana
###182 has been a medicine for a lot longer than it hasn't been a medicine
###186 evidence suggests that it was used
###188 in northern china
###191 for either
###192 shamanists purposes or religion or healing
###197 The culture of cannabis as medicine
###200 moved across the world
###203 india was very big in the use of marijuana It was from India where
###208 W.B. Oshaughnessy who
###210 work for the British East India Company
###213 picked up cannabis and brought it to the united kingdom where apparently it was queen
###217 victoria's favorite uh... treatment for her menstrual cramps. Ultimately it came
###221 to the U.S.A in the early part of the twentieth-century and most of the major drug
###225 companies in this country were actually producing
###229 cannabis medicine
###232 Up until the beginning of the twentieth century
###235 cannabis was probably the second or third most commonly used medicine
###239 in the world.
###240 Cannabis was found in patent medicines that were
###245 manufactured by such familiar names is Eli Lilly
###249 Squibb
###250 Merk, Park Davis
###252 Smith Brothers you know the Smith Brothers cough drops
###255 It was available powdered, chopped and whole
###261 as tincture. It was only in
###264 1937 when congress enacted the
###268 marijuana tax act. That imposed
###270 levy of the dollar an ounce for the use of medical marijuana that 0:04:36.169,0:04:37.180 was the beginning
###277 of the end for marijuana as a medicine in the united states. it was in 1942
###281 1942
###282 when it was totally removed from the US Pharmacopeia or at least the formulary
###286 but up until 1942 physicians could still write prescriptions for
###291 cannabis so
###292 marijuana has not been a medicine for sixty eight years in this
###297 country, but it has been a medicine in the world for 3000 years
###302 it was the
###303 miss
###306 conception that use of marijuana lead to
###311 debotury and physical violence
###314 and for that reason
###316 I guess the investigator would probably be more conservative than an they
###320 are now and that's hard to believe
###322 So was considered
###324 the way alcohol was
###327 considered in prohibition.
###329 So it was prohibited, all uses of marijuana.  It had been used medicinally
###335 as well as for recreation
###338 as well as for recreation
###338 All uses were
###341 declared illegal and marijuana was given the status of a schedule #1
###346 substances. Which means a
###347 Substance that is without any recognized demonsterable Theraputic effect.
###351 As opposed to Cocaine
###354 which was also
###355 and
###357 declared legal for recreational use but still having
###361 Medicinal properties.
###364 Which is used as a local anesthetic
###365 For which it is still used today. That's Schedule #2
###388 When the marijuana tax act was passed in 1937
###392 immediately Fiorello LaGuardia who was the mayor of new york established
###397 an august body of scientists to investigate whether the claims that
###403 marijuana use was going to increase mental illness and crime
###407 in the united states were valid
###410 and the LaGuardia commission report was
###413 issued in 1942 and they concluded
###417 that marijuana was a a good medicine
###419 and that the claims that it's use would increase crime and mental illness was
###424 unsubstantiated. Prohibition
###427 can not be enforced
###429 for the simple reason
###432 the majority of American people do not want it enforced and are resisting it's enforcement.
###437 That being so
###441 the orderly thing to do
###444 under our form of government
###447 is to abolish a law
###449 chich cannot be in enforced
###452 a law which the people of the country do not want enforced.
###457 So that sentement was
###459 repeated in 1962 when the Nixon marijuana commission
###463 of wrote their report.
###464 This was in the face of the admonition by president nixon that they
###468 not
###470 recommend
###470 the legalization
###471 of cannabis for recreational use.
###475 sufficient
###476 There is a Commission that is to make recommendations to me about this subject.... The recommendation of the
###482 commission in its first report is that we do not feel
###485 that private use or  private possession in one's own home
###490 should have the stigma of criminalization.
###493 People who experiment should not be criminalized for that particular
###499 behavior.
###500 Every ten years or so our government has sponsored
###504 another look into marijuana as medicine.
###508 The last one actually now being 1999
###511 when the Institute of Medicine did it. Every ten years
###514 these august bodies come up with the same conclusion, that
###518 there is medicinal
###520 value to marijuana.
###523 its adverse effects and
###525 its addictive potential
###527 gateway drugness are overstated
###529 and for some reason every ten years these reports go...
###534 I don't know if they are
###535 ignored, but they certainly don't seem to change policy.
###539 In 1974
###542 a fellow with glaucoma named Robert Randell
###546 was arrested for possession of marijuana.
###550 He had found a using marijuana had
###554 diminished
###554 the symptoms that he was having
###557 and
###558 it was later found
###560 by both Johns Hopkins and the Jule Styne eye institute of UCLA
###565 that this was the only thing that would preserve his eyesight
###568 and the federal government then agreed to provide
###572 Mr. Randell with marijuana for medical purposes.
###578 He had made an agreement, or the government thought he had made an agreement not to
###581 tell anybody about this. Well as soon as it happened he told as many people as he could
###585 and people begin to apply for this program
###590 which is called the IND (Investigational New Drug) program.
###593 At one time there were as many as 15  americans to were receiving
###598 300 hand rolled marijuana cigarettes a month
###602 from the federal government
###605 There were another 35 people who were approved
###607 for the program.
###609 In 1989 the
###612 first Bush administration
###614 decided that they needed to review this
###616 They were concerned that
###618 too many people were applying for the program and if too many people got on it
###622 and if too many people got on it
###623 the public might get the quote "wrong idea"
###625 that marijuana actually had some medical value which of course it actually does
###629 have some medical value.
###632 just prior to that time in 1988
###635 the chief administrative law judge of the food and drug administration
###639 issued a ruling recommending that marijuana be rescheduled from schedule #1 to
###645 schedule #2.
###647 In his ruling
###648 ruling he found that marijuana was one of the safest therapeutic agents known
###653 to man
###654 and he stated that it was safer than eating 10 potatoes.
###658 So I've always been very careful about the number of potatoes I've eaten since
###662 then.
###665 Marijuana was widely used in the 19th century with the treatment of Asthma.
###668 and in the 1970's we found that
###673 marijuana
###674 has a Bronchodilator Effect.
###676 This is because the THC in marijuana.
###688 First of all
###690 let's
###692 compare and contrast
###695 marijuana
###695 with the other even more widely smoke substance in our society tobacco.
###701 Tobacco was use more there than any other smoke substance and marijuana is
###705 second only to tobacco.
###707 Lucy give me a cigarette will ya honey....
###709 ...
###711 ...
###713 ...
###716 ...
###724 ...
###727 You see how easy it is to keep your man happy.
###730 Why not give your husband a carton of cigarettes.
###733 Smart move
###733 He will love them for their mild and smooth taste.
###738 He will love you too for thinking of him.
###742 ...
###748 We know that if you analyse
###752 the contests of tobacco and marijuana they are quite similar and the major difference is
###756 that tobacco contains nicotine
###758 not found in in marijuana
###760 and marijuana contains THC and about 60 other THC like
###766 substances called Cannabinoids
###768 not found in tobacco
###770 but there are other a lot of other particulars are shared in common
###773 and these include carcinogens
###776 such as Benzo Pyrene the most potent of the carcinogens and considered
###780 to be responsible for a large precentage of human cancers.
###785 Benzopyrene is found
###787 in 50 percent higher concentration in marijuana smoke than in the smoke from a
###792 comparable quantity of tobacco.
###794 This has been shown by 3 separate groups of chemical investigators so the
###801 expectation is
###802 that if you smoke marijuana enough in and on a regular basis
###806 you would
###807 encourage similar risks to smoking tobacco.
###811 So what are the major health risk for tobacco
###814 emphysema which I prefer to call COPD
###818 which is
###818 the new term.
###820 Which consists of cronic emphysema. You can have significant
###824 imparement of lung function without emphysema it could just be air ways disease.
###829 
###830 Because we can't separate out the 2 components of COPD
###834 emphysema and the airways component we lumped in together so
###838 that COPD
###841 COPD is the 4th leading cause of death
###844 in the U.S. and the world and will become the 3rd leading cause in 2020 it is a very important
###849 diseas. About 120000 americans die
###852 each year
###853  from
###854 COPD.
###856 probably the best evidence
###859 for separating
###860 or best method for separating out a
###864 patient with COPD from someone else is to look at the rate of decline in lung function.
###868 I shouldn't say the best it's the probably the most informative.
###873 But it's more difficult to do because you have to make measurements every
###877 year for a number of years. The slope of rate of loss of lung function over time. We did that.
###884 We actually measured lung function every year in
###889  marijuana smokers up
###891 up to 8 years.
###892 We found that
###893 the slope of the
###895 decline in lung function is almost identical in the marijuana only smokers
###900 compared to non-smokers. Where it was accellerated in tobacco smokers.
###905 Just one other
###906 piece of evidence that marijuana
###909 is not a risk factor for the development of COPD.
###912 I'm convinced of that.
###913 and the other major health consequence
###916 pulmonary health consequences of tobacco is lung cancer.
###919 Cancer is the 2nd most common cause of death
###923 in
###923 the U.S.A.
###924 and lung cancer is most common form of cancer.
###927 The major risk factor for lung cancer is tobacco smoking.
###932 About 160000 Americans die each year of lung cancer.
###936 so the question
###938 that came to my mind was whether or not there was any
###942 evidence
###943 that marijuana would at least qualitatively share
###946 some of these health risks
###949 with those of tobacco.
###952 That was the rationale for
###954 initiating our  studies back in the 1980's
###961 What is the evidence that
###963 marijuana smoking
###965 habbitual marijuana smoking can lead to lung cancer(?) With respect to
###970 the development of lung cancer
###972 We found
###973 We found no evidence of any increase risk
###978 of lung cancer
###981 ocurrance,
###981 In association with marijuana smoking alone.
###985 The marijuana smokers if  anything had a reduced risk for developing lung
###988 cancer. Not a significant reduced risk but a reduced risk
###993 less than 1 fold.
###993 So that means reduced.
###996 Whereas the tobacco smokers had markably increased risk.
###1002 Those that smoked more than 2 packs a day
###1005 had a 20  fold increase in risk. That is 2000 percent.
###1010 Those that smoked from one to two
###1012 packs a day had an 8 fold risk.
###1015 800 percent.
###1017 800 percent.
###1018 So that contrasts with
###1021 no risk, no increased risk, if anything a slightly reduced risk for smokers of marijuana
###1025 THC
###1026  actually has a
###1027 anti-tumor effect.
###1030 These are studies that were done both experimental animals and
###1035 in cell culture systems and for different kinds of cancer.
###1039 For lung cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, prostate cancer gliomas which is brain
###1045 cancer.
###1046 That the
###1048 development and growth of the tumor is suppressed
###1052 by THC and the mastastiees are also suppressed.
###1056 So how could that be(?) well THC impares protein synthesis
###1061 and it's what we call Antimitogenic anti-proliferative
###1065 which means those tumor cells don't
###1068 readily proliferate
###1069 in the presence of THC.
###1071 There are also
###1072 There are also
###1074 antiangiogenic.
###1075 So they interfere with the growth and development of new blood vessels are
###1079 necessary for it to spread.
###1081 and they also are Proapototic. What is a Proapototic (?)  It is
###1087 programmed cell death so
###1089 when cells
###1089 age there is a mechanism whereby the cells die.
###1094 It is a non-necrotic death and the die off of old cells and
###1098 we get rid of them
###1100 before they have an opportunity to develop mutations that would lead to
###1102 cancer.
###1104 So enhancing a Proapototic effect diminishes the risk of the cells become cancerous.
###1110  So marijuana or THC turns out to be Proapototic
###1114 Those
###1116 appear to be the mechanisms that might account for these antitumoral effects
###1120 of THC.
###1128 we decided to
###1130 do our own
###1130 case control study.
###1132 Funding from the National Institute on Drug Abuse which is a major funding
###1136 agencie for marijuana research.
###1139 This is the largest study
###1141 ever conducted on this subject. It was very well designed.
###1147 We used the los angeles
###1148 tumors Registry
###1150 to identify and rapidly ascertaine
###1153 all the cases of lung cancer head neck cancer cancer
###1157 that were diagnosed in the LA county system
###1160 and of course by the time we got to some of them they had already died or were too sick but we got
###1165 to it.
###1166 Over sixty percent of them
###1168 who agreed to participate
###1171 and were able to participate and we administered this questionaire.
###1174 Then we match them
###1176 to controls
###1178 same age, socioeconomic status, within the same neighborhood using an algorythm which
###1183 USC developed
###1185 for this.
###1187 So we could match comparing apples with apples.
###1190 WE then administered
###1191 this detailed questionnaires.r
###1195 Also
###1197 In molecular
###1199 we got
###1200 ... smears so we could look at
###1204 DNA to look at genetics
###1206 to look at lung cancer.
###1208 So,
###1208 what we did was too
###1212 recruit
###1213 smokers. Heavy smokers of marijuana
###1217 at least a joint a day for a week and it ended up that the average smoker of marijuana
###1222 who we recruited
###1223 smoked about 3 joints a day for about 15 years.
###1227 and
###1229 we also required that they smoked that much for five years but the average they
###1233 smoked 15 joints for fifteen years so that's = about 45 to 50
###1237 Joint years. A Joint year is the average number of joints smoked
###1240 times the number of years smoked.
###1245 Over the
###1246 study population
###1248 was I think between 35 and 59
###1252 ...
###1254 Of course we thought that they have to be
###1258 teenagers in the early twenties at the time of the
###1261 marijuana epidemic which you know was in the in the mid 1960's.
###1265 Prior to that time very few people used marijuana after that time it just mushroomed
###1270 up to 1979.
###1272 Represented the apex
###1275 that means
###1276 the active use in society.
###1277 that is why we chose those age limits and so would be find (?)
###1282 for any category of cannabis use including heavy use
###1287 (defined as more than 10 joint years)
###1289 we look at 10, 20,30 years.
###1292 For every category
###1294 of marijuana use the ratio was less than 1 which means reduced risk.
###1299 it was not significantly reduced but it was reduced.
###1302 The compensatables were not that wide
###1306 ... so there was no evidence, we control for all
###1311 accumulated factors of such economic status in common,
###1316 tobacco smoke
###1316 ....
###1318 same time we did a similar study on tobacco smokers
###1322 there was a huge effect from tobacco.
###1326 ...
###1328 ...
###1334 ...
###1335 ...
###1340 ...
###1343 ...
###1345 ...
###1349 ...
###1351 ... 0:22:33.380,0:22:38.900 ...
###1358 ...
###1360 ...
###1364 ...
###1368 ...
###1368 So. I am a cancer doctor
###1370 and everyday I see patients with cancer who have
###1373 nausea from their chemotherapy or their cancer
###1376 losses appetite
###1378 pain
###1379 depression
###1381 insomnia
###1383 my experience over the past thirty years of being an oncologist is that
###1387 there's one medicine that I could recommend to patients that can take care
###1390 of all those problems.
###1392 Instead of writing 5 different prescription drugs all of which have
###1395 side effects and
###1397 addictive potential.
###1398 I can tell my cancer patients to try
###1402 marijuana
###1403 to take care of
###1405 any combination of those symptoms.
###1408 The first study that I really wanted to do was in patience with the so-called
###1412 AIDS wasting syndrome which was something we saw
###1415 before the availability of antiretroviral drugs and
###1420 patients with HIV infections just
###1422 wasted away. They lost weight they got diarrhea and fevers.
###1427 Dronabinol delta 9 THC became available
###1430 to help those patients increase their appetite.
###1433 When we
###1434 prescribe those patients dronabinol in the
###1437 early 1990's they said "you know this is okay but I really prefer to smoke
###1441 real cannabis because
###1444 when you take
###1445 cannabis by mouth either as
###1448 delta 9 THC or eating
###1450 in fact baked products
###1452 the
###1453 absorption is very slow and variable so it takes about two and a half hours
###1457 for peak to be reached and the peak level in the blood is quite low and it
###1462 stays in the body for quite a long time as well.
###1465 Also when taken by mouth
###1467 the delta 9 THC becomes converted by liver to another
###1471 psychoactive metabolite.
###1473 people that take dronabinol
###1475 or take
###1478 cannabis baked products often get more zonked (tired) than people who smoke because when you
###1482 smoke you don't get that second metabolite.
###1485 and so when you smoke you get a
###1487 very rapid peak in the blood of in two and a half minutes
###1490 as opposed to two and a half hours.
###1493 people can really control the onset of the activity and
###1497 how long it lasts better if their smoking
###1500 rather than taking a pill or eating a baked product.
###1503 So,
###1505 our first
###1506 study that we hoped to do
###1508 in the early 1990's was to show that
###1511 smoked cannabis was better than dronabinol in
###1514 increasing appetite in patients with AIDS wasting syndrome.
###1518 I tried twice to get
###1521 cannabis from the government because they're the only legal source of
###1525 marijuana for clinical trials.
###1527 Both times I failed
###1530 and then went to Allen Leshner who at the time was the head of the
###1534 national institute on drug abuse and he explained to me infact that the government
###1540 NIDA the national institute on drug abuse has a congressional mandate only to
###1544 to study substances of abuse as substances of abuse.
###1548 So my requests have marijuana to study it has the potential therputic agent could
###1553 never be granted by the government.
###1558 because congress says you can only study these substances as substances of abuse and
###1561 not as
###1563 treatments for disease.
###1565 In 1996 the terrain changed when we got
###1570 HIV drugs that actually work
###1572 and we didn't see the wasting syndrome anymore.
###1574 but these drugs were broken down by liver by the same pathway that
###1580 metabolizes some
###1582 illegal substances and there was a report
###1584 in the literature of the patient
###1586 dying from ecstasy overdose. It was one of the aids
###1590 antiviral drugs that they took and
###1592 ecstasy at the same time.
###1594 So I said haha little light bulb went off that may be
###1598 I should study to see if it's safe
###1600 for patients on the aids antiretroviral drugs
###1603 to smoke cannabis.
###1606 So I submitted that grant to the government and that work within thier schema because I
###1610 was looking
###1611 to see if it was harmful
###1615 With that application I finally succeeded and got
###1618 a million dollars and 1400
###1621 government (marijuana)cigarettes to study
###1622 in patients with HIV. Now these patients didn't have the wasting
###1626 syndrome anymore
###1627 but the endpoint of our study was
###1630 is there a change in the amount of the aids virus in the blood stream
###1634 after 21 days of exposure to either 3
###1638 government cigarettes
###1639 a day
###1640 or three
###1642 dronabinol capsules or 3 placibo capsules.
###1646 We looked at the change in the HIV virus and it didn't change at all.
###1651 We also look at the interaction between
###1654 canabinoids
###1655 either smoke more oral and the amount of AIDS drug
###1660 in blood stream
###1661 that didn't change clinically significantly either.
###1664 We also knew that people were concerned that
###1667 marijuana might have an impact on the immune system that could be negative
###1671 and we look at that very carefully in these HIV patients and found
###1676 no evidence of any negative affect
###1678 and perhaps some have
###1680 a benefit
###1682 in the immune system
###1684 in patients
###1685 smoking even more than taking the
###1688 capsules.
###1689 My opinion the whole plant
###1691 is medicine
###1692 that nature provided.
###1694 It's the best medicine.
###1698 It is truly amazing
###1700 the number of conditions that respond favorably to cannabis. The #1
###1704 condition
###1705 is pain.
###1706 Cannabis
###1707 is useful again relieving people's pain
###1711 and is particularly effective in relieving pain from connective tissue disorders.
###1716 Arthritis, Fibromyalgia,  systemic lupus, reflex
###1720 sympathetic dystrophy. A whole host of conditions that we don't really
###1723 understand very well, people seem to get
###1727 good relief from cannabis. People are able to decreased the amount of opiates that
###1732 they're taking and in some instances to stop taking opiates entirely for pain
###1737 control.
###1738 The first modern research that was done
###1741 cannabis was done in 1949
###1745 demonstrate its usefulness in treating epilepsy. I have a number of people
###1749 who don't have epilepsy when they use cannabis regularly.
###1753 The founder of modern medicine is a Physician named Sir William Osler.
###1757 Who was prominent around the turn of the
###1760 nineteenth or twentieth century, wrote the first textbook of internal medicine
###1764 and in that textbook
###1765 he said the cannabis was the most effective medication for the treatment
###1769 of migraine headaches and I certainly have a number of people with migraines that get
###1775 substantial relief or even prevention of migraines by consumption of cannabis.
###1780 other conditions that common respond favorably to marijuana include depression,
###1785 helps people with sleep, helps with appetite.
###1788 It is also very good training
###1790 GI symptoms, nausea,
###1793 diarrhea,
###1795 it is excellent for treating Crohn's disease.
###1797 We did a little study of people with crohn's disease and found that many of
###1801 them were able to stop using steroids to stop using other
###1806 medications that they had taken for their cronies that they have
###1810 less diarrhea they had less abdomenal pain. it was true miracle for them.
###1815 There is a
###1816 list here of
###1819 conditions
###1820 that was originally developed by
###1822 doctor Tod Mikuriya. Who is a
###1825 pioneer
###1826 in terms of medical marijuana.
###1828 He actually work for the national institute of mental health and his job
###1831 was to give out
###1833 grants for doing studies on cannabis.
###1836 he thought he was there to find out
###1838 how cannabis was useful to treat medical conditions.
###1842 NIMH thought he was there to hand out grants to see how
###1846 dangerous it was. This was a marriage made hell and needless to say he did
###1850 not stay with NIMH for very long.
###1855 Cannabis is seen as a
###1858 protecting agent
###1859 and we have found
###1860 that it has provided benefits for people with multiple sclerosis.
###1865 it treats the pain in their muscle spasm
###1868 but more importantly
###1870 people who were placed on Sativex
###1872 the tincture of cannabis
###1874 in early studies in great britain have remained on it
###1877 for years and years
###1879 and rather than progress the multiple sclerosis has stayed the same.
###1885 Suggesting
###1885 that cannabis may not only be effective in reducing the symptoms
###1890 but also in slowing the progression of disease.
###1893 it is helpful when dealing with
###1895 anxiety of people that have alzheimer's disease.
###1897 It is helpful in dealing with the
###1899 muscle spasms that are associated with parkinson's disease.
###1904 When it comes to psychological illnesses cannabis is useful not only treating
###1908 depression which are already mentioned about also bipolar disorder which is
###1912 depression and mania.
###1913 It is useful in treating (ADD) attention deficit disorder,
###1917 post-traumatic stress disorder there was a study done at the Max Plank
###1920 Institute in Germany.
###1922 A few years back that demonstrated it was used for
###1926 reducing fearful memory so that might suggest white
###1930 is used for
###1932 alleviating PTSD. This is extremely important at this time when we
###1936 have
###1936 so many people who are serving multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
###1941 the pentagon has projected that at least a third of these people and I think
###1945 that is a very conservative estimate
###1948 will come back up with the symptoms of PTSD.
###1952 Matter of fact in regards to PTSD
###1954 of both the Israeli government and the Croatian government have given their
###1958 troops cannabis for treatment of PTSD.
###1965 The list just goes on and on.
###1968 Many many conditions cause pain serious conditions
###1972 ... spondylitis which can actually turn you over or make you bend over
###1977 in a crippled position.
###1980 People who have failed
###1982 back surgery.
###1984 People who have
###1986 herniated disks,
###1988 who have chronic dislocated shoulders.
###1992 All of these people
###1995 get relief from cannabis
###1997 and they find that the cannabis provides that relief
###1999 with fewer side effects
###2002 than the opiates do.
###2004 Another thing that is sort of counter intuitive
###2009 is in the treatment of asthma.
###2011 You may have seen the ads for Advair states both the bronco dialator and
###2016 anti-inflammatory.
###2017 Well so too is cannabis.
###2019 This is why ther were numerous
###2023 marijuana cigarettes on the market
###2025 in the 1920's for the treatment of asthma specifically for at
###2029 the treatment of asthma.
###2032 So as I
###2034 pointed out by holding up this list the
###2036 a list of conditions for which cannabis
###2040 is useful is extremely lengthly.
###2046 That's a quick overview of some of the conditions that cannabis
###2051 is useful in treating.
###2054 Most people tend to take cannabis at least in the evening
###2058 some people take it more often than that
###2060 and the reason is that many of these conditions interfere with sleep and then
###2065 there are some people who just have sleep problems, have insomnia difficulty.
###2070 Cannabis is very useful assisting people and going to sleep.
###2074 Now if they have difficulty staying asleep
###2077 in addition to
###2078 smoking or vaporizing or using it sublingually
###2082 they should also use it as an edible or drink it because it will kick in
###2087 45 minutes into their sleep
###2089 and it will be affective for about 5 to 6 hours.
###2096 There are a number of was
###2098 of administering
###2100 cannabis.
###2103 Smoking and vaporizing cause the
###2106 chemicals to get into the body upstream
###2109 of the liver.
###2109 So you have unmetabolized cannabinoids
###2112 that are going to the brain.
###2115 Now this doesn't mean that when the cannabinoids go to the liver that they
###2120 are inactivated
###2122 but it means that they're different 85 percent of the cannabinoid is
###2126 metabolize on its first pass to liver.
###2130 The other thing is that
###2132 when it goes to the brain immediately by the
###2136 respitory route of administration
###2138 the effect will be in 15-30 seconds.
###2141 Whereas if we wait for it to go through the GI Tract
###2144 to deliver
###2145 it will take 45 minutes before its effective.
###2149 Now each one of those routes of administration
###2152 is going to give you a slightly different
###2154 mix of chemicals
###2156 because when you smoke it you
###2157 are oxygenating the chemicals that are in there.
###2158 So when you are vaporizing
###2162 the cannabinoids that are behind where
###2167 the flame is
###2168 you're also burning
###2172 them right at the
###2173 junction.
###2174 So that smoked marijuana is not identical to vaporizing marijuana.
###2179 With the vaporized marijuana all the volitalized oils
###2184 will be vaporized by the time you get to 340 degrees C
###2187 ...
###2188 You will have removed
###2190 or been exposed to about 70 percent fewer irritants
###2194 then when you smoke it.
###2196 It also has a somewhat different odor it doesn't have the characteristic
###2200 classic burn rope odor
###2202 it has more of a
###2203 nutty odor.
###2205 Now when you eat marijuana
###2207 you're going to have metabolized 85 percent of cannabinoids.
###2212 People
###2212 who eat it talk about having a body high as opposed to
###2216 mind high.
###2218 That is because you are being exposed to different combination of cannabinoids.
###2223 Now some people have found that an under the tongue spray
###2227 which is
###2228 what Sativex is,
###2230 SAtivex is analcohol extract of the whole plant
###2234 which combines
###2236 extracts from two plants one that is high in THC
###2239 for it's theraputic value
###2241 and another that is high in CBD
###2244 to keep down the
###2246 euphoria.
###2251 When you spray it under the tongue it will be effective in about 15 minutes
###2256 But it will go to the brain first before going through the liver.
###2262 On the other hand there are many people in canada where Sativex is legal
###2266 that find that they still preferr
###2268 cannabis
###2269 to Sativex
###2271 Now sativex
###2273 is prescribed in canada
###2276 and it appears as though
###2278 the british government and or the spanish government might also approve
###2282 sativex in the near future
###2285 for sale as a pharmaceutical
###2287 in their country.
###2290 The US food drug administration (FDA)found that Sativex, basically liquid marijuana
###2295 was safe enough to be tested on americans and they approved a phase 3
###2301 clinical study, phase 3 just means human beings, in
###2305 december of 2005
###2307 to determine whether or not this under the tongue tincture spray was useful in
###2313  intractable pain of
###2315 people with cancer.
###2316 This study did not gets started until 2007 and still on going.
###2322 There have been numerous studies with cannabis and tincture of cannabis
###2327 and pain that have shown it
###2329 is useful in
###2331 releaving pain.
###2333 We talked about under the tongue we've talked about smoking talked about being
###2337 vaporization.
###2338 There's also
###2340 these synthetic delta 9 THC
###2341 that can be taken orally just like edibles.
###2345 ...
###2347 The main problem with edibles is that
###2350 it's hard to tell whether you're going to get a dose that is going to just deal
###2354 with the therapeutic needs that you have
###2357 whether it's going to give you euphoria or whether it is going to give you disphoria
###2360 you need to have
###2362 the regular supply so that you
###2365 can be fairly certain that you're going to take the amount that will be the
###2368 therapeutic dose and not an amount that will give you dysphoric
###2374 side-effects.
###2375 Lastly
###2377 the .... who are healers in
###2380 southern mexico and central america
###2383 have used tincture of cannabis as part of their
###2386 therapeutic ...
###2388 for at least 200 years. The topical application of tincture of cannabis
###2393 is useful particularly on the small joints
###2396 the fingers and toes
###2397 in dealing with pain associated with arthritis
###2401 and the reason for this is that cannabis
###2404 is both an Analgesic,
###2406 a painkiller and anti-inflammatory
###2409 and we know this not only from the evidence that we have
###2413 but also from thousands of studies have been done around the world
###2418 with
###2419 mainly with animals and sometimes tissue culture.
###2424 International Cannabinoid research society's been around for about 20 years
###2428 and the have
###2430 conferences each year the last three days in which researchers from all over
###2434 the world
###2435 talk about the results they have gotten
###2439 doing basic science studies.
###2441 Any drug
###2442 that a doctors considering recommending or prescribing they need to
###2446 balance off the therapeutic effects with the side-effects.
###2450 When you talk about the treatment of pain for many people
###2453 the opiates are very effective pain killers
###2457 but for some people
###2458 the opiates cause confusion they make it difficult for them to concentrate
###2463 difficult for them to drive
###2465 they don't enjoy playing with their kids and their grandkids
###2468 it causes them constipation.
###2471 with cannabis
###2472 for many of those people they find that it certainly does not give them
###2477 constipation
###2478 and does not cause them confusion
###2480 provides them with sufficient relief from their pain
###2483 that they can go about their activities of daily living they can drive their car
###2487 without the interference
###2489 and more importantly they can have fun they can play with their children they
###2492 can play with their grandchildren.
###2495 I wouldn't necessarily say that across the board
###2498 cannabis is to be used instead of opiates
###2502 but I would say that for many people it can be used to instead of opiates
###2507 and for others it can be used in conjunction with opiates and they can
###2510 use a lower dose of the opiates
###2512 and hopefully have fewer side effects.
###2517 Now any theriputic agent
###2518 that we know of
###2519 has some side effects
###2521 and marijuana is no exception.
###2523 The main side-effect to the
###2525 use of marijuana
###2526 is from smoking it and that is cough.
###2529 So that can be completely avoid
###2531 by easting it or drinking
###2533 and it can be largly avoided by vaporizing it.
###2537 One of the things that is talked about a lot
###2539 is that you can have a panic reaction and that is
###2544 possible it most commonly occurs
###2546 in  people who
###2547 are novices users.
###2549 Particularly
###2549 if they've been exposed to plant
###2551 that is very high in THC.
###2555 Another thing that
###2556 people sometimes have is
###2558 paranoid thinking
###2560 police are after them.
###2562 I've noticed that this is not nearly
###2564 used common since it has become legal becausethe police are not after them
###2568 and so it may not be paranoia
###2570 that people were experiencing but
###2572 an exaggerated perception of reality
###2576 and one of the things
###2577 we have lost as a result of the
###2582 propaganda miss information that is spread about cannabis
###2585 is the fact that it has legitimate therapeutic value and we have
###2590 discouraged research.
###2591 We have a dramatic discouraged research in this country and
###2595 numerous other countries including
###2599 england israel spain
###2600 germany
###2601 are far ahead of us in terms of
###2604 quantity of research they are doing on the medicinal value of cannabis.
###2609 This is particularly alarming
###2610 in these economic times when we certainly could
###2614 use the economic stimulus and
###2617 boost that would come
###2618 from having pharmaceutical cannabis available in the country
###2623 as it is now in Canada
###2625 and possibly soon will be
###2627 england and spain.
###2629 Jefferson said that
###2631 this country would be in dire straits if we have laws that
###2637 interfered with what we put into our own bodies.
###2640 Are we not
###2642 in control of our own bodies?
###2645 If the people let the government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take, their bidies will soon be in as sorry a state as are the souls of those who love under tyrany Quote- Thomas Jefferson
###2660 Make the most of the Indian Hemp seed and sow it everywhere. Quote- George Washington
###2675 ...
###2683 ...
###2686 Marijuana is a medicine that patients themselves can grow.
###2691 For people with cancer who may be facing
###2695 thinking about the end of their life to be able to grow
###2698 a plant in work in the garden and produce their own medicine is very empowering.
###2705 Something that
###2706 I think does a patient a lot of good.
###2710 Marijuana is illegal
###2712 and the government
###2713 does not sponsor this kind of research.
###2716 In view of the fact that large numbers of people are
###2719 using marijuana medicinally I think it's a shame that
###2723 there is no investment in this kind of research.
###2729 I think that there is a very bright future
###2731 for medical cannabis in this country.
###2733 I grew up around drugs
###2736 but to me drugs are a good thing. I walked into building
###2740 everyday almost of my
###2743 first 18 years that had a 13 foot tall sign that said
###2746 Drugs... my father was a pharmacist and
###2749 we sold medication.
###2752 As far as I am concerned medication is helpful to people
###2755 I don't think that
###2757 medication has personality and sits on the self until
###2761 you prescribe it for somebody.
###2764 It has
###2766 beneficial use
###2766 and has side effects and should only be used when necessary.
