[MUSIC PLAYING]


3
0:0:29,1 --> 0:0:37,41
I just started my professorial
duty in Frankfurt on Monday


4
0:0:37,41 --> 0:0:38,2
night, actually.


5
0:0:38,2 --> 0:0:41,21
I'm the film class professor.


6
0:0:41,21 --> 0:0:43,61
It's very serious.


7
0:0:43,61 --> 0:0:47,56
And one of the things I said
to one of the students was


8
0:0:47,56 --> 0:0:52,43
that I was a very diligent
student, and I did my life


9
0:0:52,43 --> 0:0:53,32
drawing class.


10
0:0:53,32 --> 0:0:56,57
And I did my stained
glass window class.


11
0:0:56,57 --> 0:0:58,87
I did my mural painting class.


12
0:0:58,87 --> 0:1:4,87
The only class that I really
got deliberately ill enough


13
0:1:4,87 --> 0:1:8,84
not to be able to attend
was the video class.


14
0:1:8,84 --> 0:1:11,21
I always hated it.


15
0:1:11,21 --> 0:1:15,48
I knew what I liked, and
what I liked was film.


16
0:1:15,48 --> 0:1:21,93
And there was something very
primal for me, in that I don't


17
0:1:21,93 --> 0:1:28,95
really like information to be
shot straight into my eye.


18
0:1:28,95 --> 0:1:32,6
I always preferred the idea
that you are getting it in


19
0:1:32,6 --> 0:1:35,77
some kind of a third-hand way.


20
0:1:35,77 --> 0:1:37,98
You have the celluloid.


21
0:1:37,98 --> 0:1:40,7
A light passes through.


22
0:1:40,7 --> 0:1:41,4
It hits the screen.


23
0:1:41,4 --> 0:1:43,66
And then your eye gets it.


24
0:1:43,66 --> 0:1:46,91
And there's something softer,
even if you're watching a very


25
0:1:46,91 --> 0:1:51,46
hard series of images,
with difficult ideas.


26
0:1:51,46 --> 0:1:54,1
I think there's a
softer landing.


27
0:1:54,1 --> 0:2:0,75
It's very telling that
technocrats and technicians


28
0:2:0,75 --> 0:2:6,39
have been pushing video to be as
close to film as possible.


29
0:2:6,39 --> 0:2:12,475
Therefore, film is still
on that pedestal.


30
0:2:12,475 --> 0:2:29,6



31
0:2:29,6 --> 0:2:35,48
When I started looking at films
in a certain way, and


32
0:2:35,48 --> 0:2:40,35
doing almost nothing to them
except re-presenting the way


33
0:2:40,35 --> 0:2:43,82
that they would be seen, or
could be seen, that definitely


34
0:2:43,82 --> 0:2:48,24
is coming from the kind of
intellectual rigor that I had


35
0:2:48,24 --> 0:2:49,74
through my studies in London.


36
0:2:49,74 --> 0:2:53,78
But I think the choices of the
films that I worked on were


37
0:2:53,78 --> 0:2:56,35
probably coming from
this much more


38
0:2:56,35 --> 0:2:58,683
autobiographical exercise.


39
0:2:58,683 --> 0:3:4,82



40
0:3:4,82 --> 0:3:12,12
Let's take, for example,
Hitchcock's "Psycho" and "Taxi


41
0:3:12,12 --> 0:3:14,1
Driver," for instance.


42
0:3:14,1 --> 0:3:18,18
I didn't see "Psycho," I think,
until I was about 21.


43
0:3:18,18 --> 0:3:27,5
And I didn't see "Taxi Driver"
until I was about 26 or 27.


44
0:3:27,5 --> 0:3:32,96
I mean, there was a lot to do
with the old experience of


45
0:3:32,96 --> 0:3:34,36
cinema, as well.


46
0:3:34,36 --> 0:3:37,71
And the fact that there was
something happening, I think,


47
0:3:37,71 --> 0:3:42,59
in the 1980s, in Britain at
least, that cinema was going


48
0:3:42,59 --> 0:3:47,16
down, and TV and VCR
was coming up.


49
0:3:47,16 --> 0:3:53,29
And my experience of film was
definitely much more in the


50
0:3:53,29 --> 0:3:57,67
domestic situation, rather than
the communal cinematic,


51
0:3:57,67 --> 0:4:0,66
or cathedral, of cinema,
which I like


52
0:4:0,66 --> 0:4:3,1
to think about sometimes.


53
0:4:3,1 --> 0:4:8,44
And then when I got into it, and
hit the French New Wave--


54
0:4:8,44 --> 0:4:11,68
and one of the most important
books, which I think is one of


55
0:4:11,68 --> 0:4:16,16
the best books on cinema ever,
is the interviews between


56
0:4:16,16 --> 0:4:17,57
Hitchcock and Truffaut.


57
0:4:17,57 --> 0:4:21,93
And that was kind of a turning
point, I think, for me, when I


58
0:4:21,93 --> 0:4:25,41
realized that there were
different types of cinema.


59
0:4:25,41 --> 0:4:31,1
They could be deconstructed,
and you could openly seduce


60
0:4:31,1 --> 0:4:37,8
people at the same time as being
slightly intellectual.


61
0:4:37,8 --> 0:4:43,54
One of my students, actually, in
Frankfurt, said to me, when


62
0:4:43,54 --> 0:4:44,79
was the last time you
went to the cinema?


63
0:4:44,79 --> 0:4:47,77



64
0:4:47,77 --> 0:4:53,15
I had to kind of lie and say,
I never go to the cinema for


65
0:4:53,15 --> 0:4:54,64
moral reasons.


66
0:4:54,64 --> 0:4:57,91
But the last time I was in the
cinema was to see my work.


67
0:4:57,91 --> 0:4:59,73
Last time I was in the
cinema before that


68
0:4:59,73 --> 0:5:1,52
was to see my work.


69
0:5:1,52 --> 0:5:3,15
The last time I was in the
cinema before that


70
0:5:3,15 --> 0:5:4,56
was to see my work.


71
0:5:4,56 --> 0:5:7,88
And that just sounds like
such a load of wank.


72
0:5:7,88 --> 0:5:13,85
To a student, sometimes it's
better not to tell the truth.


73
0:5:13,85 --> 0:5:25,63
[MUSIC PLAYING]


74
0:5:25,63 --> 0:5:31,355
When I started to work with the
material, and I mean when


75
0:5:31,355 --> 0:5:36,12
the material will be a
videotape, and like an


76
0:5:36,12 --> 0:5:39,54
innocent person, I did take a
videotape and held it up-- and


77
0:5:39,54 --> 0:5:41,3
there's nothing to see.


78
0:5:41,3 --> 0:5:42,56
And that's magical, as well.


79
0:5:42,56 --> 0:5:45,36
It appears to be nothing,
but it contains all this


80
0:5:45,36 --> 0:5:46,61
information of a different--


81
0:5:46,61 --> 0:5:49,2



82
0:5:49,2 --> 0:5:52,16
I suppose it's the early idea of
the avatar, in a way, that


83
0:5:52,16 --> 0:5:57,3
the cinema screen has all
these characters behind.


84
0:5:57,3 --> 0:5:59,84
And I think with "24 Hour
Psycho," when I installed that


85
0:5:59,84 --> 0:6:6,31
in Glasgow for the first time
in 1993, I wanted to put the


86
0:6:6,31 --> 0:6:9,89
screen in the middle of the
space, so when you went behind


87
0:6:9,89 --> 0:6:14,32
it, you just saw the same thing
from the other side, but


88
0:6:14,32 --> 0:6:15,39
from the other side.


89
0:6:15,39 --> 0:6:17,37
So that's when I started
to get interested


90
0:6:17,37 --> 0:6:19,75
in the mirror image.


91
0:6:19,75 --> 0:6:23,56



92
0:6:23,56 --> 0:6:30,46
I went from there into hospital
archives, and started


93
0:6:30,46 --> 0:6:36,12
to dig around and for images
which looked magical, because


94
0:6:36,12 --> 0:6:41,4
they were shot by
cinematographers, even though


95
0:6:41,4 --> 0:6:44,2
they were done, apparently,
for medical purposes.


96
0:6:44,2 --> 0:6:47,25
It became obvious that I was
going to have to get behind


97
0:6:47,25 --> 0:6:49,9
the camera one day, rather
than stand in


98
0:6:49,9 --> 0:6:50,61
front of the mirror.


99
0:6:50,61 --> 0:6:55,24
I had to take another step back
and be behind the camera,


100
0:6:55,24 --> 0:7:0,34
and behind the lens, also
in front of a mirror.


101
0:7:0,34 --> 0:7:14,65
[MUSIC PLAYING]


102
0:7:14,65 --> 0:7:17,73
I knew I had to start
making films.


103
0:7:17,73 --> 0:7:21,91
And actually, the first film
that I made was called


104
0:7:21,91 --> 0:7:25,78
"Feature Film." Maybe I wasn't
confident enough to think that


105
0:7:25,78 --> 0:7:29,29
I would make anything other than
that, so I had this kind


106
0:7:29,29 --> 0:7:35,21
of very teenage, vain idea
that in my life I always


107
0:7:35,21 --> 0:7:39,98
wanted to write a short novel,
make a record, and make a


108
0:7:39,98 --> 0:7:40,84
feature film.


109
0:7:40,84 --> 0:7:43,18
So at least I got the
feature film done.


110
0:7:43,18 --> 0:7:46,79



111
0:7:46,79 --> 0:7:55,39
And having done that, which
was a study of a conductor


112
0:7:55,39 --> 0:7:57,55
with an orchestra--


113
0:7:57,55 --> 0:8:0,83
the orchestra are never seen, so
how would you know that he


114
0:8:0,83 --> 0:8:2,92
would be a conductor?


115
0:8:2,92 --> 0:8:8,84
And the orchestra are playing
the score to Hitchcock's


116
0:8:8,84 --> 0:8:9,82
"Vertigo."


117
0:8:9,82 --> 0:8:23,6
[MUSIC PLAYING]


118
0:8:23,6 --> 0:8:30,72
And when we showed that, some
people who saw it had asked me


119
0:8:30,72 --> 0:8:35,919
questions like, how many little
images did you slip in


120
0:8:35,919 --> 0:8:40,63
from "Vertigo?" Because they
really think that they saw


121
0:8:40,63 --> 0:8:44,36
James Stewart or Kim
Novak in my film.


122
0:8:44,36 --> 0:8:46,58
And it never happened.


123
0:8:46,58 --> 0:8:54,64
But cinematic experience and
the music obviously was


124
0:8:54,64 --> 0:8:58,27
powerful enough that images
were coming from inside of


125
0:8:58,27 --> 0:9:0,65
their head, and they were
projecting their


126
0:9:0,65 --> 0:9:3,53
images onto my film.


127
0:9:3,53 --> 0:9:9,93
And I thought that that's an
incredibly sophisticated and


128
0:9:9,93 --> 0:9:12,45
perverse thing to happen.


129
0:9:12,45 --> 0:9:23,39



130
0:9:23,39 --> 0:9:26,78
After making "Feature Film," and
I was quite confident by


131
0:9:26,78 --> 0:9:33,44
that time then about working
in the industry.


132
0:9:33,44 --> 0:9:39,23
So the premise for "Zidane" was
what if we make a feature


133
0:9:39,23 --> 0:9:46,39
film which is a portrait, and
why not make it around a


134
0:9:46,39 --> 0:9:49,26
football player?


135
0:9:49,26 --> 0:9:52,77
And of course when we went to
see Zidane it became three


136
0:9:52,77 --> 0:9:53,7
questions--


137
0:9:53,7 --> 0:10:0,25
what if, why not, and
Zidane said, why me?


138
0:10:0,25 --> 0:10:4,34
And we said to him, no
one really knows what


139
0:10:4,34 --> 0:10:6,91
aftershave you wear.


140
0:10:6,91 --> 0:10:9,73
We don't know if you go
out to nightclubs.


141
0:10:9,73 --> 0:10:13,67
You exist from the first
kick of the ball


142
0:10:13,67 --> 0:10:15,69
until the final whistle.


143
0:10:15,69 --> 0:10:22,7
And that's what's incredibly
special about you as a player.


144
0:10:22,7 --> 0:10:24,39
He represents something
which is exclusively


145
0:10:24,39 --> 0:10:29,92
him, completely chimeric.


146
0:10:29,92 --> 0:10:34,21
So he becomes everyone else.


147
0:10:34,21 --> 0:10:41,475
The day before the match,
that's when our


148
0:10:41,475 --> 0:10:42,77
crew started to arrive.


149
0:10:42,77 --> 0:10:47,99
And you can imagine 17 or 18
cameras, each camera having an


150
0:10:47,99 --> 0:10:53,76
operator, a focus puller,
a loader, and a runner.


151
0:10:53,76 --> 0:10:56,72
I think the crew was about 150
or something like that.


152
0:10:56,72 --> 0:10:59,68



153
0:10:59,68 --> 0:11:1,16
The pressure was on.


154
0:11:1,16 --> 0:11:6,51
And still the producers were
saying to us, you have to make


155
0:11:6,51 --> 0:11:8,26
a storyboard.


156
0:11:8,26 --> 0:11:9,37
And we said, we can't.


157
0:11:9,37 --> 0:11:12,51
It's a live event.


158
0:11:12,51 --> 0:11:15,45
And they said, but you have to
be able to say something to


159
0:11:15,45 --> 0:11:19,11
the operators about what
it is that you want.


160
0:11:19,11 --> 0:11:25,31
So Philippe and I had
a little chat.


161
0:11:25,31 --> 0:11:28,33
The collection of portraits in
the Prado is probably one of


162
0:11:28,33 --> 0:11:30,63
the best in the world.


163
0:11:30,63 --> 0:11:34,4
So we took our camera
guys there on the


164
0:11:34,4 --> 0:11:36,26
morning of the game.


165
0:11:36,26 --> 0:11:39,755
And they opened up the doors to
the Prado, and we walked in


166
0:11:39,755 --> 0:11:42,245
through the Goya entrance.


167
0:11:42,245 --> 0:11:48,51
And you have this vast corridor
of portrait after


168
0:11:48,51 --> 0:11:50,63
portrait after portrait.


169
0:11:50,63 --> 0:11:56,42
And we said to the film guys, to
the operators, this is our


170
0:11:56,42 --> 0:11:58,29
storyboard.


171
0:11:58,29 --> 0:12:1,99
Look down the corridor, and
imagine that every painting is


172
0:12:1,99 --> 0:12:3,716
a film still.


173
0:12:3,716 --> 0:12:8,72
And as we're walking past,
please look carefully at every


174
0:12:8,72 --> 0:12:10,545
still that you're seeing.


175
0:12:10,545 --> 0:12:15,9
Now, we're shooting at 24 frames
a second, but we want


176
0:12:15,9 --> 0:12:19,96
all of the information that
you're seeing from this Goya,


177
0:12:19,96 --> 0:12:22,84
which probably took about
a year to paint--


178
0:12:22,84 --> 0:12:25,54
we want a year's worth
in everything.


179
0:12:25,54 --> 0:12:30,92
So we obviously set the
bar pretty high.


180
0:12:30,92 --> 0:12:33,25
And it was astonishing.


181
0:12:33,25 --> 0:12:37,67
These guys who shoot, who look
at people, and look at events


182
0:12:37,67 --> 0:12:40,21
as their daily bread,
had never seen


183
0:12:40,21 --> 0:12:43,33
anything quite like that.


184
0:12:43,33 --> 0:12:46,39
One of the most beautiful
memories that I have is


185
0:12:46,39 --> 0:12:53,11
standing in front of these two
paintings of the Duchess of


186
0:12:53,11 --> 0:12:59,5
Alba, I think it is,
both by Goya, same


187
0:12:59,5 --> 0:13:3,5
woman lying on a chaise.


188
0:13:3,5 --> 0:13:5,1
One she has her clothes on.


189
0:13:5,1 --> 0:13:9,6
One she is not wearing
clothes.


190
0:13:9,6 --> 0:13:14,82
But the angle of observation
is slightly different.


191
0:13:14,82 --> 0:13:18,33
And Philippe and I were saying,
we don't really know


192
0:13:18,33 --> 0:13:21,87
how to explain what's going on
here, but look at the dynamic


193
0:13:21,87 --> 0:13:25,19
between the two pictures.


194
0:13:25,19 --> 0:13:28,5
It's a phenomenon.


195
0:13:28,5 --> 0:13:33,34
So we got the most expensive
storyboard in the history of


196
0:13:33,34 --> 0:13:35,64
film done, because we
used the Prado.


197
0:13:35,64 --> 0:13:44,6



198
0:13:44,6 --> 0:13:46,68
I don't think that anybody that
I really respect thinks


199
0:13:46,68 --> 0:13:50,75
of themselves in any world.


200
0:13:50,75 --> 0:13:54,15
The best chefs I know
are always involved


201
0:13:54,15 --> 0:13:57,46
in something else.


202
0:13:57,46 --> 0:13:59,79
The best filmmakers are always
involved in something else.


203
0:13:59,79 --> 0:14:2,25
The best singers are always
doing something else.


204
0:14:2,25 --> 0:14:10,65
I think you can be a hermetic,
but within your little hermit


205
0:14:10,65 --> 0:14:13,93
cave or whatever, I think it's
important that you have


206
0:14:13,93 --> 0:14:16,97
something else happening
somewhere else in the world.


207
0:14:16,97 --> 0:14:21,79



208
0:14:21,79 --> 0:14:27,4
One of the best comments that
a teacher ever made to her


209
0:14:27,4 --> 0:14:30,5
class in Glasgow was, you're
here for four years--


210
0:14:30,5 --> 0:14:33,15



211
0:14:33,15 --> 0:14:37,12
don't feel that you have to
leave and be an artist.


212
0:14:37,12 --> 0:14:40,34
Just enjoy this four years that
you have here, because


213
0:14:40,34 --> 0:14:42,23
you'll never have this amount
of freedom again.


214
0:14:42,23 --> 0:14:47,47



215
0:14:47,47 --> 0:14:50,9
And as a little lotus eater
that I am, I wanted to


216
0:14:50,9 --> 0:14:55,4
perpetuate that four years
for as long as possible.


217
0:14:55,4 --> 0:15:1,59
So that's why I don't really
have a huge engagement with


218
0:15:1,59 --> 0:15:4,9
what's perceived to be the art
market, or the art world, or


219
0:15:4,9 --> 0:15:10,77
the film world, or
anything else.


220
0:15:10,77 --> 0:15:13,74
People will always put
you in a pigeonhole.


221
0:15:13,74 --> 0:15:15,39
Why would you fly
in on your own?


222
0:15:15,39 --> 0:17:15,39
