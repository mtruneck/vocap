###16 MALE SPEAKER: What's all this fucking shit on the wall?
###19 
###25 JASON DILL: I woke up-- for like a month straight-- just
###28 with blood in my mouth.
###29 MALE SPEAKER: How'd it get on the wall?
###30 Spitting?
###30 JASON DILL: Yeah.
###31 14 dental appointments and they're still fucked up.
###36 I know it's gross.
###37 People probably think it's fucked up.
###39 I mean every day you come in here you've got like--
###42 literally, I'm not going to look at it.
###44 I'm just going to be like, [SPITTING], spit it out.
###45 I just had to see it, just to make sure.
###48 So I had to look at it every day, knowing how
###50 crazy it was getting.
###51 It was just a reminder of just how bad it was.
###56 PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, welcome back to the show.
###58 This episode's about Jason Dill.
###60 And I know we already did a Jason Dill episode.
###63 But while I was making that, I was looking at all of his old
###65 parts and stuff.
###65 And I thought it'd be cool to do sort of the history of
###68 Jason Dill.
###69 JASON DILL: My very, very, very first ad was I was
###72 sitting in a shopping cart with Caroll
###74 sitting in the front.
###75 Caroll, Ben Chibber, and Anthony Oglesby.
###77 Me and Anthony Oglesby are the little guys.
###80 Caroll is only like a year and a half, two
###82 years older than me.
###83 But I remember them being like, hey go get Caroll to go
###86 shoot this ad.
###87 Fucking--
###89 what?
###89 Like, I'm not going to talk to this dude.
###92 Like, it's Mike fucking Caroll.
###94 My first video part was an A1 Meats where--
###97 MALE SPEAKER: Is that the one where you're running through
###98 the-- doing like cartwheels through the grass?
###100 JASON DILL: Yeah, and doing flips and shit.
###101 I was 12.
###102 I filmed for three days.
###103 I was just, I can bigspin that.
###105 I can 360 flip that.
###107 Like, just, all right, do it.
###108 I don't remember like ever taking time.
###111 I would check out--
###111 I remember seeing Ocean and Marcus like really try shit.
###115 I remember I got driven to 7th Street, skate the head.
###119 And I remember this one kid had a box in
###121 front of his house.
###121 So I did like a nose bump 360.
###123 And I'll hit some gap there.
###125 Instead of like, yeah, I'm just going to go fucking--
###126 I was a little kid.
###127 Like, I'm going to go ollie this big gap.
###129 All right.
###131 You know, like Rick Howard, he taught me how to do a bigspin
###134 to frontside boardslide a day before I got on Blockhead.
###137 And I tried it in my contest run for some
###140 reason like a day after.
###143 Who the fuck knows how I made it to here.
###145 Jesus Christ.
###146 Because if you really think about it from that perspective
###148 and then so if you could only imagine, like fast forward to
###150 me skating with Ocean.
###151 Like, those dudes are so far in advance compared to my
###156 prepubescent mind.
###158 I mean, I'm sure Hensley and them were doing it before.
###159 But I didn't have the opportunity to go skate with
###161 Hensley in my prepubescent years.
###163 MALE SPEAKER: So did you skate with Jeremy Wray?
###167 JASON DILL: Yeah.
###168 That's weird.
###168 I was talking to someone about this recently.
###170 I don't even remember how I met Jeremy.
###173 I remember people doing pressure flips, but Jeremy was
###175 doing over knee-high kickflips.
###178 So he was a really big influence on my whole deal.
###183 MALE SPEAKER: What was the clip where he does a gap and
###187 you're in the clip?
###188 JASON DILL: The Color Video.
###190 
###191 I know I'm in that video because I tried to ollie that
###194 gap with Jeremy.
###195 No, I didn't come anywhere near Jeremy.
###197 I don't think I got over it.
###199 I don't even think I got my board over it with my body.
###202 MALE SPEAKER: Where is that?
###203 Where's the mark?
###204 JASON DILL: Give me five.
###206 Over here.
###207 MALE SPEAKER: How'd he do that?
###209 Nobody can--
###210 I don't believe it.
###211 It can't be possible.
###214 I don't believe what I just saw.
###215 I don't believe what I just saw.
###216 MALE SPEAKER: I even saw it with my two eyes.
###218 MALE SPEAKER: But I don't believe what I just saw.
###222 Look at these marks.
###224 Look at these marks.
###226 JASON DILL: I never thought about it
###227 until later, you know?
###228 Thinking about it right now, I never thought of myself being
###231 in Jeremy Wray's shadow.
###232 I was in Jeremy Wray's shadow, but not in a bad way.
###236 Those dudes were so fucking gnarly.
###237 It really helped me shape and have what feeds me today.
###245 Man, I've had a fucking weird, wild ride.
###247 When I was like a fucking child,
###250 how the fuck my mother--
###253 how she let me do this, I do not know.
###258 My mom got this job.
###260 And she went up to a business trip in San Francisco, took me
###263 with her, skated the streets by myself.
###266 I'm talking about sweat pants, Converse, and a Batman t-shirt
###270 with a mullet.
###272 I was a goofy white kid from Huntington Beach, man.
###274 I was just fucking--
###274 I was just enjoying being there.
###278 I wasn't even worried about being accepted.
###281 So that was my little early EMB niche that I somehow
###285 sorted out on my own.
###287 And then by the time I was 15, I already rode for
###290 Spitfire and shit.
###291 So it's like, I think I just got accepted.
###293 And at that time, which was kind of rad, they just lumped
###296 me, Jeremy, and Jonas together.
###297 And hey were like, fuck, all right.
###298 You're on the team too.
###298 MALE SPEAKER: Were you there when Gino did
###301 the backside heelflip?
###302 JASON DILL: No.
###302 I wasn't there when Gino did the backside heelflip.
###304 I talked to Gino on the phone.
###306 I was just thinking about it, when you mentioned that
###308 Spitfire video.
###309 What happened with the Spitfire video was that I
###312 didn't ride for anybody except for Spitfire and Thunder.
###315 And within that time frame, I had already started filming
###320 with this dude Dave Sloshbach that was friends with Brian
###324 Lotti that was trying to get Gino and I to do this offshoot
###328 company, World Industries.
###329 And then, thank god, fucking right before Brian Lotti left
###333 skateboarding, he left our footage on Natas's desk.
###337 Natas had a desk to leave footage on.
###339 Natas called Gino's house.
###341 I remember sitting there, being like, fucking Natas is
###344 on the phone.
###345 And he was like, do you want to ride for 101?
###348 So we got on 101, and immediately released Snuff.
###351 It was the footage of us skating just World and Blind,
###356 101 Plan B boards.
###358 MALE SPEAKER: I remember you telling me one time that they
###360 saw your 101--
###363 whatever, your tape to get on 101 or something.
###365 And [INAUDIBLE] or somebody was like, oh yeah we like you.
###368 But I don't know about your friend Gino.
###370 
###375 Am I remembering that wrong?
###377 JASON DILL: There's no way because Gino was already so
###379 well respected before he even really hit that scene that I
###385 kind of went on his coattails.
###387 I think I had such a big mouth when it came down to what my
###390 opinion was that the people that I did business with were
###396 like, well this fucking little loud-mouthed kid.
###398 He's so about it.
###400 Like, fuck it.
###401 Throw him out there.
###402 Let's see what he does.
###402 And I think I've been thrown out there so many times to see
###404 what I can do that I ended up just having to
###408 become as big as my--
###411 I thought my britches were, or whatever.
###414 I know how anti-climactic it sounds, but then I was pro.
###419 I don't really remember.
###420 And then the whole 101 thing kind of turned into a really
###423 rad thing, though.
###424 Yeah, right after Snuff was 20 Shot Sequence.
###427 And what happened was I hurt my knee.
###431 I tore my ACL in half.
###434 Yeah, so that video came out with a super small part, the
###436 20 Shot Sequence video.
###437 But Natas let me help him edit that 101 section.
###443 My mom had seen enough of me around the house and was just
###446 not stoked on how bummed out I was, I'm sure.
###449 I'm sure she really felt for me.
###450 And the very first clip of me coming back is
###453 that line at Flushing.
###455 It's the first time I skated in eight, nine months.
###458 MALE SPEAKER: What was the line?
###459 JASON DILL: The heelflip over the grate with the pipe,
###462 nollie backside [INAUDIBLE] flat, switch 5-0, switch
###464 frontside 180 out.
###465 And that was the beginning of Trilogy.
###468 Yeah, my part in that video was fucking balls
###469 to the wall, man.
###471 I think that was everything I'd ever achieved to bin was
###474 in that video part.
###475 Like, up until that point, I think that's everything I ever
###478 worked for.
###480 Finally, like--
###481 Finally, like as gnarly as Gino's part was in that video,
###484 I felt finally I had my own niche.
###486 I achieved all my goals at 19.
###488 Anything after that was just icing on the cake.
###490 By the time that came out, Natas quit, and
###493 I got kicked off.
###495 So the day Trilogy came out, I got kicked off.
###500 MALE SPEAKER: But you're in it.
###501 JASON DILL: Yeah.
###502 MALE SPEAKER: And so--
###502 OK.
###504 Why'd they do that?
###505 JASON DILL: Because I stole boards because I was--
###508 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, I heard about that.
###510 JASON DILL: I had no money.
###511 Gino made $1,500 a month and I made 1,000.
###514 One day we went to roll in the streets and they were like,
###517 you're not getting paid this month.
###519 With Trilogy about--
###522 Trilogy master tape, done.
###525 Parts, done.
###527 You're not getting paid.
###528 MALE SPEAKER: How many boards did you steal?
###529 JASON DILL: 36.
###532 Because then I can get-- if I had 36 boards I could pay my
###534 rent and get an ounce of pot.
###539 And then I'd just live off Top Ramen and Kool-Aid like I'd
###541 been doing.
###542 
###553 That Memory Screen blew me away.
###555 If anybody's seen Memory Screen, it just like--
###557 I remember [INAUDIBLE] like, you were into it?
###559 Like a little kid, like that whole first part?
###562 I was like, yes.
###563 Like the [MAKING SOUNDS].
###564 
###567 I'd sing the song, that middle section.
###569 
###572 I can't forget to tell you something that you're going to
###574 think is funny.
###575 You'll probably use it, after this.
###576 But when I was skating for 23, I was going to SF a lot,
###579 during that fit shit because I rode for a
###583 company called C/O Wheels.
###585 C/O was short for cocaine.
###587 So stupid.
###589 What age is that, like 21?
###591 I was like 21 years old, going to SF all the time, smoking
###596 cocaine blunts, being nutty.
###599 Like, turning into that weird dude who would just take drugs
###601 when he's with you and not tell you.
###603 Like, that was never me, but I turned into that.
###605 It was a really strange period.
###608 In my 23 ad, it's that ollie over to frontside tailslide on
###611 that pole, where you have to do the gap thing.
###614 Henry Sanchez had wrote, Michael Bolton-ass looking
###618 motherfucker.
###619 And I remember being so hurt by it.
###624 And then it just being one of those things like, well fuck,
###629 at least one of the gnarly dudes wrote it.
###631 Yeah.
###632 And then I remember being--
###634 towards the end of my contest skating days--
###636 and I just--
###636 I went to a contest in Canada.
###639 And all I did was hang out with Dyrdek and Kalis.
###642 I came home from that contest and it said I rode for Alien
###646 Workshop in the new Slap Magazine.
###649 So I called Chris Carter, knowing him.
###652 And I was like, hey, it says I ride for
###658 Workshop in the new magazine.
###660 I just want you to know I have nothing--
###661 I didn't--
###663 that's not me.
###663 He's all, I know.
###665 And I think he said something along the lines of like, no,
###667 we OKed it.
###668 That's cool.
###669 And they just knew.
###671 They knew I'd be riding for Workshop because I tried to
###672 get on Workshop when I got kicked off 101.
###674 Carter, he always calls bullshit on it.
###676 But I remember getting Memory Screen.
###679 It was yellow.
###680 It was a VHS, yellow tape.
###683 I liked Dinosaur Jr. I knew who they were.
###687 Carter always calls-- no, you didn't.
###688 Fuck.
###689 Bullshit.
###689 You didn't know who--
###691 yeah, pfft.
###692 Just Alien Workshops is just such a
###694 fucking sick, smart company.
###696 Like, I always adored them.
###698 And so it was a pleasure to be at Workshop.
###701 It was really great.
###702 But the video that people always come up to us about is
###707 the fucking Feedback video.
###709 People love that goddamn video.
###712 And we put Ty through so much shit making that video.
###715 Because we made that video right before we put
###717 our Alien part out.
###719 Poor Ty was making that Feedback video of us, like
###721 totally showing us, showcasing us in that section.
###725 And we were like, fuck this shit, Ty.
###726 We want to do our Alien part.
###728 Fuck a Transworld video.
###729 Fuck--
###730 Transworld video--
###731 what the fuck, Transworld.
###732 That's bullshit.
###733 We didn't know what it was going to look like.
###734 And then that fucking Feedback video came out.
###737 Everyone had just the raddest parts in it.
###739 Kids that were born when that part came out still
###743 come up at a demo.
###745 Feedback.
###745 They love that video.
###747 CHRIS CARTER: Dude, you got-- this is your big video.
###749 This is it.
###750 JASON DILL: OK, OK, OK, OK.
###751 All right.
###752 No problems.
###753 I'm only skating.
###754 I'm just skating.
###755 I swear.
###755 That's it.
###756 That's all.
###757 So far I heard I got the last part and all that shit.
###760 So [INAUDIBLE]
###760 so psyched.
###761 CHRIS CARTER: You know what the last part
###763 means, don't you?
###763 JASON DILL: I do!
###764 CHRIS CARTER: That's the curtains.
###766 JASON DILL: A lot of people don't believe this, but they
###768 started recording me for about a year straight without
###771 telling me.
###773 So what you see in Photosynthesis is a mixture of
###776 conversations me and Carter had over a year.
###779 And that's not Carter you see at the desk.
###781 It's just a stock photo they found of some guy at a desk.
###785 My mom thought that was Carter for years until she met him.
###789 Photosynthesis took about two years of work-work.
###791 I think for so long, I always felt that this is what I'm
###798 going to do.
###799 I'd want to be individualistic, and I'd want
###801 people to know me for me and not part of some
###804 big team, or whatever.
###806 MALE SPEAKER: Everyone always talks about the walking down
###808 the stairs.
###809 JASON DILL: No, I just thought it worked.
###811 I was trying to film a line and--
###813 what was it?
###813 Originally, it was just a backside
###815 heelflip over that barricade.
###816 And so then I started doing this stupid fucking 360 flip
###819 that I ate shit on so bad up at the top of the street.
###823 And that spot got demolished after 9/11.
###828 But what it was-- like, you cruise down this small street,
###832 and the fakie shuvit over the bench because I've always
###834 loved that trick.
###835 No one does that very much.
###836 And then to pick up the board--
###839 I just figured it would transfer so well to walk down
###841 the stairs.
###843 One, two, three, four, down!
###844 And then I jumped that.
###847 That was a pretty fucking big gap that was there then.
###849 I was a much younger man at the time.
###852 It's just part of the video.
###854 And then just the reaction I've gotten out of that over
###856 the years is just insane.
###857 MALE SPEAKER: So then--
###858 then my brother Joe hit me in the chin with a crowbar.
###862 I turned around and talked to Joe.
###864 You know, why you [INAUDIBLE].
###865 It's not necessary.
###866 Don't hit me in the chin.
###867 [INAUDIBLE]
###867 I don't like, OK?
###869 Joe comes over, has a gun, shoos me in the stomach,
###872 shoots another guy over there really fast.
###874 Shoots him down.
###875 [MAKING GUN SOUNDS]
###876 Right?
###877 Everybody's freaking out, going crazy.
###879 I'm like, Joe, stop shooting everybody, man.
###881 This is crazy!
###882 Those people are going to die!
###884 [LAUGHING]
###885 MALE SPEAKER: I can't take it.
###886 [LAUGHING]
