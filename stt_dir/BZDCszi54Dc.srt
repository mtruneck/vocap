0:0:3,7 --> 0:0:6,7
<i>Here's the deal:</i>
<i>Turk and Elliot wrote a paper</i>


2
0:0:6,7 --> 0:0:7,807
<i>on peripheral vascular disease,</i>


3
0:0:7,807 --> 0:0:10,847
<i>They're upset because they</i>
<i>have to present it at a conference,</i>


4
0:0:10,847 --> 0:0:13,967
Do you know how many interns
would die to do that?


5
0:0:13,967 --> 0:0:17,607
Not me, l don't care. l know my paper
was a trillion times better.


6
0:0:17,607 --> 0:0:21,927
lt's so political. Surprise! They went
with the black guy and the girl.


7
0:0:21,927 --> 0:0:24,87
- Bambi.
- What?


8
0:0:24,87 --> 0:0:26,687
What right do they have to be mopey?


9
0:0:26,687 --> 0:0:29,927
<i>That's when Elliot said</i>
<i>something that explained everything,</i>


10
0:0:29,927 --> 0:0:32,367
Our parents are coming.


11
0:0:32,367 --> 0:0:33,967
Oh, l am so sorry.


12
0:0:33,967 --> 0:0:36,87
<i>I could tell my friends were upset,</i>


13
0:0:36,87 --> 0:0:38,767
- <i>Still there was a bright side,</i>
- lt's all right.


14
0:0:38,767 --> 0:0:40,767
<i>I knew I could make it worse,</i>


15
0:0:40,767 --> 0:0:42,527
- Missed a spot!
- You could help!


16
0:0:42,527 --> 0:0:45,447
- You can't even hear the TV!
- l like the pictures.


17
0:0:45,447 --> 0:0:46,767
<i>If I believed in karma</i>


18
0:0:46,767 --> 0:0:49,767
<i>I'd be more cautious</i>
<i>about giving these guys a hard time,</i>


19
0:0:49,767 --> 0:0:52,567
Hey, Dad.
No, no, nothing.


20
0:0:52,567 --> 0:0:56,47
Turk and Elliot are freaking out
because their parents are coming.


21
0:0:56,47 --> 0:0:57,567
<i>But karma doesn't scare me,</i>


22
0:0:57,567 --> 0:1:1,487
No. lt hasn't been that long
since you and l saw each other.


23
0:1:1,487 --> 0:1:2,887
- Dad?
- Hey, Mr Dorian.


24
0:1:2,887 --> 0:1:4,607
Hey, boys, what's shakin'?


25
0:1:4,607 --> 0:1:7,847
- Who needs a beer?
- Who doesn't?


26
0:1:7,847 --> 0:1:10,127
You see, JD,
this is what goes around.


27
0:1:10,127 --> 0:1:12,207
But this?
This is what comes around.


28
0:1:12,207 --> 0:1:14,247
- Get out of here.
- Only two left.


29
0:1:14,247 --> 0:1:34,607
- That's all right. JD'll go out.
- Oh, get some chips.


30
0:1:34,607 --> 0:1:36,567
Wowser, Rowdy's a boy dog.


31
0:1:36,567 --> 0:1:39,127
<i>My mom and dad</i>
<i>got divorced when I was seven,</i>


32
0:1:39,127 --> 0:1:42,207
<i>That's not unusual but though</i>
<i>everybody's relationship</i>


33
0:1:42,207 --> 0:1:46,407
<i>with their father is different mine has</i>
<i>always seemed very different,</i>


34
0:1:46,407 --> 0:1:49,767
God, l'd like to take a run at her.
Look at that rack.


35
0:1:49,767 --> 0:1:52,967
- Dad, please.
- l'm sorry, Johnny. l'm just a man.


36
0:1:52,967 --> 0:1:55,847
- You know what they say about men.
- They love boobies.


37
0:1:55,847 --> 0:1:57,647
That's is correct, Christopher.


38
0:1:57,647 --> 0:2:0,47
OK, you know, l think
l'm gonna hit the sack


39
0:2:0,47 --> 0:2:2,87
before l get
even more uncomfortable.


40
0:2:2,87 --> 0:2:4,87
Your mother had a beautiful bosom.


41
0:2:4,87 --> 0:2:6,287
- There it is.
- Would you stay?


42
0:2:6,287 --> 0:2:8,527
We've got a lot of catching up
to do. Please.


43
0:2:8,527 --> 0:2:11,127
OK.


44
0:2:11,127 --> 0:2:13,247
You guys have a policy on farting?


45
0:2:13,247 --> 0:2:15,327
No, let 'er rip.


46
0:2:15,327 --> 0:2:17,767
Fire in the hole.


47
0:2:17,767 --> 0:2:19,207
Oh, my God, Dad.


48
0:2:19,207 --> 0:2:21,807
Count it!


49
0:2:21,807 --> 0:2:26,207
That was a nice moment.


50
0:2:26,207 --> 0:2:28,567
<i>I guess everyone's parents</i>
<i>drive them crazy,</i>


51
0:2:28,567 --> 0:2:31,607
So this is my hospital.


52
0:2:31,607 --> 0:2:34,807
lt's stunning.


53
0:2:34,807 --> 0:2:38,127
Honey, is there a rule against
looking pretty here?


54
0:2:38,127 --> 0:2:40,487
Nothing official.


55
0:2:40,487 --> 0:2:44,367
l just think you would look
so much more handsome in blue scrubs.


56
0:2:44,367 --> 0:2:45,447
Thank you, Mommy,


57
0:2:45,447 --> 0:2:48,167
but l like my green scrubs better.


58
0:2:48,167 --> 0:2:51,647
<i>Parents have a way of making</i>
<i>their children regress,</i>


59
0:2:51,647 --> 0:2:54,327
l don't want to wear blue scrubs!


60
0:2:54,327 --> 0:2:57,327
Come on. Boy, you better
watch your manners.


61
0:2:57,327 --> 0:2:59,87
Come on, now.


62
0:2:59,87 --> 0:3:3,7
You can't have one, sweetheart.
Perms are for trailer trash.


63
0:3:3,7 --> 0:3:6,167
What in the hell is this,
parents' weekend?


64
0:3:6,167 --> 0:3:8,367
Sort of.
Elliot and Turk wrote this paper,


65
0:3:8,367 --> 0:3:10,767
then my dad decided
''l wanna come too,'' so...


66
0:3:10,767 --> 0:3:13,327
Look, Reba, if l ask you a question


67
0:3:13,327 --> 0:3:16,207
that doesn't specifically deal
with a medical issue,


68
0:3:16,207 --> 0:3:19,407
you can bet your powdered bottom
l don't want you to answer.


69
0:3:19,407 --> 0:3:21,167
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.


70
0:3:21,167 --> 0:3:27,487
lt's like working with a monkey.


71
0:3:27,487 --> 0:3:29,527
- What?
- Nothing.


72
0:3:29,527 --> 0:3:31,927
Why didn't you introduce me
to your mother?


73
0:3:31,927 --> 0:3:35,567
Because she just came by to say ''hey''
before she checked into her hotel.


74
0:3:35,567 --> 0:3:37,767
She's coming back
later to look around.


75
0:3:37,767 --> 0:3:40,487
OK. l was worried you thought
she might not like me.


76
0:3:40,487 --> 0:3:43,567
She's not gonna like you.
Baby, look.


77
0:3:43,567 --> 0:3:46,967
My mother's never called any girl
l've been with by her name.


78
0:3:46,967 --> 0:3:49,327
She called my college
girlfriend The Big Easy.


79
0:3:49,327 --> 0:3:51,807
Well, was she fat and slutty?


80
0:3:51,807 --> 0:3:53,567
She had beautiful skin.


81
0:3:53,567 --> 0:3:55,607
Don't smile, woman. She did.


82
0:3:55,607 --> 0:3:57,487
Just beautiful.


83
0:3:57,487 --> 0:3:59,927
So, what do you guys think?


84
0:3:59,927 --> 0:4:2,887
l think it's time to get back
to the suite and get in a bath.


85
0:4:2,887 --> 0:4:5,487
This place makes me feel dirty.


86
0:4:5,487 --> 0:4:9,367
Dr Kelso? Dr Kelso,
these are my parents.


87
0:4:9,367 --> 0:4:11,7
Ah, well!


88
0:4:11,7 --> 0:4:14,687
lt's a pleasure to meet the trees
from which our little acorns fall.


89
0:4:14,687 --> 0:4:16,607
- Bob Kelso.
- Simon Reid.


90
0:4:16,607 --> 0:4:18,887
l'm chief of medicine
at St Augustine's.


91
0:4:18,887 --> 0:4:21,607
lt's a private hospital in Greenwich.


92
0:4:21,607 --> 0:4:24,327
l know what you're thinking.
You didn't ask.


93
0:4:24,327 --> 0:4:27,167
Nobody ever does.


94
0:4:27,167 --> 0:4:32,927
So, how long
are you guys staying?


95
0:4:32,927 --> 0:4:35,447
Can l help you, sir?


96
0:4:35,447 --> 0:4:37,407
- Sir?
- You can help me


97
0:4:37,407 --> 0:4:40,847
by minding your own damn business.


98
0:4:40,847 --> 0:4:42,927
Excuse me?


99
0:4:42,927 --> 0:4:45,47
Oh, aggressive, huh?


100
0:4:45,47 --> 0:4:48,327
Do you really want to
get it on with me, pipsqueak?


101
0:4:48,327 --> 0:4:50,687
Because if you do, l guarantee


102
0:4:50,687 --> 0:4:55,727
it'll be the last stupid thing
you ever do on God's green earth.


103
0:4:55,727 --> 0:4:57,207
Nice meeting you.


104
0:4:57,207 --> 0:5:1,367
<i>What the hell was that all about?</i>


105
0:5:1,367 --> 0:5:5,847
Dad. Don't wander off like that.


106
0:5:5,847 --> 0:5:8,407
This is your basic
arthrocentesis there.


107
0:5:8,407 --> 0:5:11,367
Your resident should've
shown you how to do this.


108
0:5:11,367 --> 0:5:12,807
<i>He can't be that mad,</i>


109
0:5:12,807 --> 0:5:15,407
<i>Even though residents</i>
<i>are supposed to teach you</i>


110
0:5:15,407 --> 0:5:17,647
<i>they only show up</i>
<i>when they want something,</i>


111
0:5:17,647 --> 0:5:20,327
l have to give the students
a lecture on heart murmurs.


112
0:5:20,327 --> 0:5:22,87
- Could you do it?
- Actually...


113
0:5:22,87 --> 0:5:25,247
Thanks, man.


114
0:5:25,247 --> 0:5:29,287
That sucks. l totally wanted to spend
some time with my dad tomorrow.


115
0:5:29,287 --> 0:5:31,207
Then take him.


116
0:5:31,207 --> 0:5:33,287
- What do you mean?
- l don't know?


117
0:5:33,287 --> 0:5:36,87
Secure some kind of vehicle,
car, balloon, tricycle,


118
0:5:36,87 --> 0:5:39,527
and transport your father from where
he is to where you're going.


119
0:5:39,527 --> 0:5:41,287
l don't think you get my dad.


120
0:5:41,287 --> 0:5:43,927
He's not interested in my work.
He's more of like a buddy.


121
0:5:43,927 --> 0:5:46,887
OK. That was my mistake.


122
0:5:46,887 --> 0:5:50,447
Here, l engaged you and gave you
the impression that l actually care,


123
0:5:50,447 --> 0:5:53,527
which is just so wrong! God!


124
0:5:53,527 --> 0:5:55,767
The thing is,
l don't need a buddy.


125
0:5:55,767 --> 0:5:57,487
What l need is a father.


126
0:5:57,487 --> 0:5:59,447
You definitely need something.


127
0:5:59,447 --> 0:6:2,687
Maybe a backbone.
Or perhaps some testicles.


128
0:6:2,687 --> 0:6:6,207
At the very least, a pillow that
you could carry around the hospital


129
0:6:6,207 --> 0:6:10,687
and just cry your sad eyes out
into whenever trauma...


130
0:6:10,687 --> 0:6:13,167
l have testicles.


131
0:6:13,167 --> 0:6:16,567
He's a kidder.


132
0:6:16,567 --> 0:6:17,727
All right, this is it.


133
0:6:17,727 --> 0:6:20,687
Brace yourself and let me handle
this nice and smooth.


134
0:6:20,687 --> 0:6:23,247
All right?
Hey, Mom, guess what.


135
0:6:23,247 --> 0:6:25,767
Hi, Mrs Turk,
l'm gonna cut to the chase.


136
0:6:25,767 --> 0:6:28,887
l'm Carla. l apologise if your
son hasn't told you about me.


137
0:6:28,887 --> 0:6:31,807
l don't know how you've
put up with him as long as you did.


138
0:6:31,807 --> 0:6:34,127
Still, you should know
he loves me very much,


139
0:6:34,127 --> 0:6:36,807
l feel the same
and we're really good together.


140
0:6:36,807 --> 0:6:39,47
- Are you two sharing a bed?
- No!


141
0:6:39,47 --> 0:6:40,567
Yes, ma'am, we are.


142
0:6:40,567 --> 0:6:44,767
But if you're a good judge of character,
you can tell l'm not messing around.


143
0:6:44,767 --> 0:6:48,7
- Carla. lt's a nice name.
- Thank you.


144
0:6:48,7 --> 0:6:51,327
- Yes, it is, Mother.
- Oh, please. Not telling me about her.


145
0:6:51,327 --> 0:6:54,207
Dear, do me a favour.
Don't give him any for a month or so.


146
0:6:54,207 --> 0:6:56,687
- Done.
- lt can't go down like that.


147
0:6:56,687 --> 0:7:0,247
lt just can't go down like that.


148
0:7:0,247 --> 0:7:2,7
After you, sir.


149
0:7:2,7 --> 0:7:3,287
Well, l'll be.


150
0:7:3,287 --> 0:7:5,967
l haven't seen a ward
like this since Vietnam.


151
0:7:5,967 --> 0:7:9,287
So where in Connecticut
was your National Guard unit stationed?


152
0:7:9,287 --> 0:7:11,287
- Amusing.
- l thought so.


153
0:7:11,287 --> 0:7:15,447
l think they're totally
getting along, don't you?


154
0:7:15,447 --> 0:7:18,687
l'm about to open
a fat can of whup-ass on you.


155
0:7:18,687 --> 0:7:21,527
Bring it on, bitch.


156
0:7:21,527 --> 0:7:26,127
All right, sports fans,
we have a guest today at rounds,


157
0:7:26,127 --> 0:7:28,447
so let's try and be sharp.


158
0:7:28,447 --> 0:7:30,487
Why don't we begin with,


159
0:7:30,487 --> 0:7:32,727
l don't know, Dr Reid.


160
0:7:32,727 --> 0:7:36,367
What is the nutritional cause
of high output cardiac failure?


161
0:7:36,367 --> 0:7:38,567
Wet beriberi
from thiamine deficiency.


162
0:7:38,567 --> 0:7:41,447
Yes, it is. Next question.


163
0:7:41,447 --> 0:7:45,727
Why don't we try...


164
0:7:45,727 --> 0:7:47,367
...Dr Reid.


165
0:7:47,367 --> 0:7:49,527
l already went, sir.


166
0:7:49,527 --> 0:7:53,367
- Oh, are you done for the day?
- No.


167
0:7:53,367 --> 0:7:57,367
What's the mechanism of Cheyne-Stokes
respiration in systolic dysfunction?


168
0:7:57,367 --> 0:7:59,47
<i>What? Nobody knows that,</i>


169
0:7:59,47 --> 0:8:1,447
Prolongation of circulation time
from lung to brain


170
0:8:1,447 --> 0:8:4,47
causing diminished sensitivity
of the respiratory centre


171
0:8:4,47 --> 0:8:6,127
to arterial partial pressure
of carbon dioxide?


172
0:8:6,127 --> 0:8:14,7
Yes.


173
0:8:14,7 --> 0:8:16,207
My dad winked at me!


174
0:8:16,207 --> 0:8:18,887
lf that's not saying,
''l love you, l'm proud of you,''


175
0:8:18,887 --> 0:8:20,527
- l'm not sure what is.
- l know!


176
0:8:20,527 --> 0:8:23,807
There are no gratuitous winks
in the Reid household.


177
0:8:23,807 --> 0:8:26,167
<i>And that's when I decided</i>
<i>to take a chance,</i>


178
0:8:26,167 --> 0:8:30,767
l'd love to come to your heart murmur
lecture. l'm a big fan of those things.


179
0:8:30,767 --> 0:8:32,367
That means a lot, Dad.


180
0:8:32,367 --> 0:8:34,367
<i>Absolutely, Please,</i>


181
0:8:34,367 --> 0:8:38,567
Oh, dear Lord,
please make it stop.


182
0:8:38,567 --> 0:8:40,607
- lt's stunning.
- Thank you.


183
0:8:40,607 --> 0:8:42,967
- And l understand that you...
- l make these.


184
0:8:42,967 --> 0:8:46,487
Like two wolves gabbing about
which sheep to eat.


185
0:8:46,487 --> 0:8:50,407
Unfortunately for them, l'm a man.


186
0:8:50,407 --> 0:8:53,167
- Turk.
- Coming.


187
0:8:53,167 --> 0:8:55,207
- Thanks.
- Thank you.


188
0:8:55,207 --> 0:8:57,47
Hi, Mrs Turk.


189
0:8:57,47 --> 0:9:1,487
John Dorian, get over here.


190
0:9:1,487 --> 0:9:4,247
After all these years,
are you still afraid of me?


191
0:9:4,247 --> 0:9:8,487
On Thanksgiving, l said your turkey was
dry, and you picked me up and shook me.


192
0:9:8,487 --> 0:9:10,647
- Then don't say that.
- Silly Bambi.


193
0:9:10,647 --> 0:9:12,47
You guys, leave him alone.


194
0:9:12,47 --> 0:9:15,567
l've had enough of you two
conspiring and whatnot. lt ends now!


195
0:9:15,567 --> 0:9:18,567
lt is so cute when he
thinks he's in charge.


196
0:9:18,567 --> 0:9:21,647
- l know. lt kills me.
- <i>And that's when it happened,</i>


197
0:9:21,647 --> 0:9:27,607
You should see him when l pretend
to let him...make a decision!


198
0:9:27,607 --> 0:9:37,767
<i>That's when Carla realised</i>
<i>she was exactly like Turk's mom,</i>


199
0:9:37,767 --> 0:9:39,847
Great job at rounds today, Dr Reid.


200
0:9:39,847 --> 0:9:42,847
- Thank you, sir.
- Your dad must've been very impressed.


201
0:9:42,847 --> 0:9:44,367
Yeah, l think so.


202
0:9:44,367 --> 0:9:46,727
l could tell that
he respected you, sir.


203
0:9:46,727 --> 0:9:49,47
Well, that's very nice,
but lucky for me,


204
0:9:49,47 --> 0:9:52,207
my self-esteem isn't tied up
in that kind of poppycock.


205
0:9:52,207 --> 0:9:55,327
l didn't become a doctor
to impress my daddy or anyone else.


206
0:9:55,327 --> 0:9:57,87
l did it for me.


207
0:9:57,87 --> 0:10:0,207
l've seen lots of doctors
get into this for the wrong reason.


208
0:10:0,207 --> 0:10:2,767
- You know what happens to them?
- No.


209
0:10:2,767 --> 0:10:6,567
They quit and get
their real estate licence.


210
0:10:6,567 --> 0:10:8,647
You look upset, sweetheart.


211
0:10:8,647 --> 0:10:10,167
You shouldn't be.


212
0:10:10,167 --> 0:10:12,727
l think you'd look super
in a gold blazer.


213
0:10:12,727 --> 0:10:16,447
Thank you?


214
0:10:16,447 --> 0:10:21,7
This is almost too easy.


215
0:10:21,7 --> 0:10:22,927
Well, work is great, Johnny.


216
0:10:22,927 --> 0:10:25,647
l like to believe
that l'm selling dreams.


217
0:10:25,647 --> 0:10:30,127
- But, Dad, you sell office supplies.
- Yeah, l prefer to call them dreams.


218
0:10:30,127 --> 0:10:33,407
l'm gonna steal another Jell-O.


219
0:10:33,407 --> 0:10:36,487
<i>I always thought parents</i>
<i>were like tornadoes,</i>


220
0:10:36,487 --> 0:10:40,407
<i>They blow into town</i>
<i>and devastate everything in their path,</i>


221
0:10:40,407 --> 0:10:43,807
- Hi.
- There's no food on your tray.


222
0:10:43,807 --> 0:10:44,967
Oh.


223
0:10:44,967 --> 0:10:48,807
<i>But it's different for me,</i>


224
0:10:48,807 --> 0:10:52,327
How you doing, Elliot?


225
0:10:52,327 --> 0:10:55,287
Great talk. Anyway, Johnny,


226
0:10:55,287 --> 0:10:58,87
l was talking to my buddy, Jake,
this afternoon.


227
0:10:58,87 --> 0:11:0,927
- You remember Jake?
- No.


228
0:11:0,927 --> 0:11:3,607
Jake's my buddy,
and he's leaving the country


229
0:11:3,607 --> 0:11:5,887
for who knows how long.
So l thought l might


230
0:11:5,887 --> 0:11:8,607
get out of here tomorrow
and go catch up with him.


231
0:11:8,607 --> 0:11:10,87
l'd miss your thing,


232
0:11:10,87 --> 0:11:12,567
but l wouldn't know
what l was hearing anyway.


233
0:11:12,567 --> 0:11:14,527
- Right?
- Right.


234
0:11:14,527 --> 0:11:16,527
<i>I think what surprised me the most</i>


235
0:11:16,527 --> 0:11:18,887
<i>is that I was actually surprised,</i>


236
0:11:18,887 --> 0:11:20,727
You still talking to yourself?


237
0:11:20,727 --> 0:11:28,567
l thought you'd outgrow that by now.


238
0:11:28,567 --> 0:11:31,287
<i>I probably should've</i>
<i>woken him up to say goodbye</i>


239
0:11:31,287 --> 0:11:33,727
<i>considering he'd be gone</i>
<i>before I got home,</i>


240
0:11:33,727 --> 0:11:36,607
<i>I told myself I wanted to let</i>
<i>the old guy get some sleep</i>


241
0:11:36,607 --> 0:11:43,567
<i>but even I didn't believe that,</i>


242
0:11:43,567 --> 0:11:45,47
You keep eating that,


243
0:11:45,47 --> 0:11:47,687
there'll be nothing left
for a man to put a ring on.


244
0:11:47,687 --> 0:11:49,687
Mom...


245
0:11:49,687 --> 0:11:51,647
...l started therapy.


246
0:11:51,647 --> 0:11:54,447
Do you know that Amy Swanson's
marrying Drew Gertson?


247
0:11:54,447 --> 0:11:56,487
Drew is such a nice boy.


248
0:11:56,487 --> 0:11:59,127
Drew used to hold people down
and spit in their mouths.


249
0:11:59,127 --> 0:12:0,727
He doesn't do that anymore.


250
0:12:0,727 --> 0:12:3,687
Mom, when l was a little girl,
did l want to be a doctor?


251
0:12:3,687 --> 0:12:6,447
Maybe l used a toy stethoscope
on one of my dolls?


252
0:12:6,447 --> 0:12:9,847
Oh, honey,
you'd have to ask the nanny.


253
0:12:9,847 --> 0:12:12,127
Have you ever reached
a point in your life


254
0:12:12,127 --> 0:12:14,767
when you really wished
you knew how you got there?


255
0:12:14,767 --> 0:12:17,7
Are you trying to tell me
you're a lesbian?


256
0:12:17,7 --> 0:12:18,727
Yes, l am.


257
0:12:18,727 --> 0:12:20,487
Yep.


258
0:12:20,487 --> 0:12:25,967
That's exactly...
exactly what l'm saying, Mom.


259
0:12:25,967 --> 0:12:28,687
Yo, JD. You want to grab
a bite to eat with us tonight


260
0:12:28,687 --> 0:12:30,727
after we do our presentation?


261
0:12:30,727 --> 0:12:32,287
Yeah, l'm not that busy.


262
0:12:32,287 --> 0:12:35,687
lf you're not busy, you have time
to do this discharge summary.


263
0:12:35,687 --> 0:12:38,527
- l meant that later l'm not that busy.
- Fantastic.


264
0:12:38,527 --> 0:12:42,167
l told my mom you like that Cuban
restaurant. She loves Cuban food...


265
0:12:42,167 --> 0:12:44,47
l hate that restaurant.


266
0:12:44,47 --> 0:12:48,47
You said you loved it and wanted
to be buried in a vat of <i>plátanos</i>


267
0:12:48,47 --> 0:12:49,567
so you could eat your way out.


268
0:12:49,567 --> 0:12:52,567
See? That's our problem.
You don't get me.


269
0:12:52,567 --> 0:12:56,327
No argument there.


270
0:12:56,327 --> 0:12:59,87
Hey, hey, hey!
You missed a spot, right there.


271
0:12:59,87 --> 0:13:0,847
Well, lucky for me, Dad,


272
0:13:0,847 --> 0:13:4,807
l spend my life going in a circle around
this place cleaning up after the sick.


273
0:13:4,807 --> 0:13:7,287
Tomorrow l'll probably
be here at the same time.


274
0:13:7,287 --> 0:13:11,207
You know that l hate sass, so
drop right down and give me 20.


275
0:13:11,207 --> 0:13:13,927
- That could be faecal matter.
- Make it 30.


276
0:13:13,927 --> 0:13:16,87
Fine.


277
0:13:16,87 --> 0:13:17,687
<i>What is it with parents?</i>


278
0:13:17,687 --> 0:13:20,327
<i>Why is it so easy for them</i>
<i>to make us feel bad?</i>


279
0:13:20,327 --> 0:13:23,247
- ...three...
- Sound off like you've got a pair!


280
0:13:23,247 --> 0:13:25,167
Dad, l don't gotta put up with...


281
0:13:25,167 --> 0:13:27,687
You've got to at least try
and pace yourself.


282
0:13:27,687 --> 0:13:30,407
Otherwise, sure as shooting,
you're gonna burn out.


283
0:13:30,407 --> 0:13:33,447
Come.


284
0:13:33,447 --> 0:13:36,567
l heard the sad sigh,
l see your shoulders are slumped,


285
0:13:36,567 --> 0:13:38,927
and l'm aware that
you have some problem


286
0:13:38,927 --> 0:13:40,487
you want to talk to me about.


287
0:13:40,487 --> 0:13:43,807
You probably think it'll be
cathartic to get it off your chest,


288
0:13:43,807 --> 0:13:45,807
but believe me, it won't be.


289
0:13:45,807 --> 0:13:48,567
What you've got to do,
for me, is the healthy thing.


290
0:13:48,567 --> 0:13:52,887
Keep all of your feelings bottled up
inside where they so belong.


291
0:13:52,887 --> 0:13:55,527
My dad flaked on me again.


292
0:13:55,527 --> 0:13:58,567
l'm sorry. You're not
on drugs, are you?


293
0:13:58,567 --> 0:13:59,967
What? No.


294
0:13:59,967 --> 0:14:3,47
Are you in jail? Have you been beaten?
Are you malnourished?


295
0:14:3,47 --> 0:14:5,447
l skipped lunch,
but l've been snacking.


296
0:14:5,447 --> 0:14:8,567
You are, in fact, a perfectly
healthy 26-year-old doctor


297
0:14:8,567 --> 0:14:11,847
who keeps crying about
how horrible his father was.


298
0:14:11,847 --> 0:14:14,887
Well, he did some considerable
emotional damage, so...


299
0:14:14,887 --> 0:14:18,447
Every one of our parents does
considerable emotional damage,


300
0:14:18,447 --> 0:14:20,367
and from what l've heard,


301
0:14:20,367 --> 0:14:23,647
it just might be the best part
of being a parent.


302
0:14:23,647 --> 0:14:26,7
lf some guy ever does put
a ring on your finger,


303
0:14:26,7 --> 0:14:29,927
and you're lucky enough to pop out a
youngster, l'm sure you'll understand.


304
0:14:29,927 --> 0:14:33,407
But for now, trust me when
l tell you that l wouldn't care


305
0:14:33,407 --> 0:14:36,647
if today was the first time
you ever even met your daddy.


306
0:14:36,647 --> 0:14:39,727
Because in reality,


307
0:14:39,727 --> 0:14:42,527
well, he could've done
a much, much worse job.


308
0:14:42,527 --> 0:14:45,847
OK.


309
0:14:45,847 --> 0:14:48,247
All right, look, at the presentation,


310
0:14:48,247 --> 0:14:52,87
could l do the ending?
l really love the end of our paper.


311
0:14:52,87 --> 0:14:54,407
Do you think that l'm
cut out to be a doctor?


312
0:14:54,407 --> 0:14:56,567
OK, fine.
You can do the ending.


313
0:14:56,567 --> 0:14:59,207
l just want to say,
''Thanks, folks. We've been great.''


314
0:14:59,207 --> 0:15:2,727
l'm serious. Do you think this
is what l really want to do?


315
0:15:2,727 --> 0:15:4,727
Elliot, l don't know.


316
0:15:4,727 --> 0:15:6,767
You can tell me. l can take it.


317
0:15:6,767 --> 0:15:10,167
No, l'm saying ''l don't know''
because l really don't know.


318
0:15:10,167 --> 0:15:13,447
What the hell is going on here?


319
0:15:13,447 --> 0:15:17,87
Why have all women gone crazy?


320
0:15:17,87 --> 0:15:19,207
l'm not crazy. Am l?


321
0:15:19,207 --> 0:15:21,327
No. Shh.


322
0:15:21,327 --> 0:15:24,967
lt's OK, Elliot.
You're normal. You're normal.


323
0:15:24,967 --> 0:15:27,927
- Turk?
- He's not here.


324
0:15:27,927 --> 0:15:30,367
Turk.


325
0:15:30,367 --> 0:15:32,967
l do like that Cuban restaurant.


326
0:15:32,967 --> 0:15:36,567
l think the important thing
is that we got through this together.


327
0:15:36,567 --> 0:15:39,687
l'm freaked out because your mom
and l have lots in common.


328
0:15:39,687 --> 0:15:42,207
- So?
- l don't know.


329
0:15:42,207 --> 0:15:44,607
l got this crazy idea
that you only fell for me


330
0:15:44,607 --> 0:15:47,527
because l'm just like your mom.


331
0:15:47,527 --> 0:15:50,887
Baby...


332
0:15:50,887 --> 0:15:53,807
That's exactly why l fell for you.


333
0:15:53,807 --> 0:15:56,567
OK. l'll probably have
a friend pick up my stuff.


334
0:15:56,567 --> 0:15:59,127
Wait. Sit down.


335
0:15:59,127 --> 0:16:1,287
What's wrong with wanting someone


336
0:16:1,287 --> 0:16:7,287
because they're smart, independent
and always looking out for you?


337
0:16:7,287 --> 0:16:8,607
OK?


338
0:16:8,607 --> 0:16:14,247
Yeah. But if we ever get married, we'll
have to talk about this in therapy.


339
0:16:14,247 --> 0:16:18,447
Relax. l don't do this with my mama.


340
0:16:18,447 --> 0:16:21,967
l hope not.


341
0:16:21,967 --> 0:16:25,47
- Oh, yeah, Mama.
- Oh, that's just wrong.


342
0:16:25,47 --> 0:16:28,327
Oh, Mama.


343
0:16:28,327 --> 0:16:30,247
<i>Part of me</i>
<i>thought Cox was wrong,</i>


344
0:16:30,247 --> 0:16:32,407
<i>I had every reason</i>
<i>to be angry with my father,</i>


345
0:16:32,407 --> 0:16:34,807
So, how's it going down there?


346
0:16:34,807 --> 0:16:37,767
lf it's OK with you,
we just won't talk right now.


347
0:16:37,767 --> 0:16:40,487
Got a needle. Need to focus.


348
0:16:40,487 --> 0:16:42,767
<i>Then I stopped</i>
<i>thinking of my dad as a father</i>


349
0:16:42,767 --> 0:16:45,167
<i>and started thinking of him as a man,</i>


350
0:16:45,167 --> 0:16:49,287
<i>And I realised some things that</i>
<i>deep down I probably always knew,</i>


351
0:16:49,287 --> 0:16:53,207
<i>Like maybe he wasn't crashing on my</i>
<i>couch to spend more quality time with me</i>


352
0:16:53,207 --> 0:16:55,887
<i>but because he couldn't</i>
<i>afford a hotel room,</i>


353
0:16:55,887 --> 0:16:58,967
<i>And maybe he wasn't going</i>
<i>to see his buddy Jake to catch up</i>


354
0:16:58,967 --> 0:17:2,647
<i>but because Jake was someone</i>
<i>he might be able to sell something to</i>


355
0:17:2,647 --> 0:17:4,967
<i>and he really needs a sale,</i>


356
0:17:4,967 --> 0:17:7,847
<i>Maybe the truth is he's</i>
<i>just a middle-aged lonely guy</i>


357
0:17:7,847 --> 0:17:10,287
<i>struggling to get by</i>
<i>and it sure would be nice</i>


358
0:17:10,287 --> 0:17:12,687
<i>if someone gave him</i>
<i>a break once in a while,</i>


359
0:17:12,687 --> 0:17:14,7
Hey, Dad.


360
0:17:14,7 --> 0:17:16,167
Hey, there he is.


361
0:17:16,167 --> 0:17:18,407
l thought you had to work all day.


362
0:17:18,407 --> 0:17:20,687
l did, but l got someone
to cover for me.


363
0:17:20,687 --> 0:17:23,487
l wanted to make sure
l caught you and let you know


364
0:17:23,487 --> 0:17:25,247
how cool it was to see you.


365
0:17:25,247 --> 0:17:27,727
- Really?
- Yeah.


366
0:17:27,727 --> 0:17:30,647
Wow, l...


367
0:17:30,647 --> 0:17:33,247
Well, listen, l'm, you know,


368
0:17:33,247 --> 0:17:35,487
l have to travel a lot lately, so...


369
0:17:35,487 --> 0:17:39,287
...l'm sure l'll be back
in this region again soon.


370
0:17:39,287 --> 0:17:43,167
So l could swing back out
and see you.


371
0:17:43,167 --> 0:17:45,687
- That'd be great.
- Great.


372
0:17:45,687 --> 0:17:49,167
- Great.
- Great. l'd be happy to see you.


373
0:17:49,167 --> 0:17:50,527
Yeah, we could do that.


374
0:17:50,527 --> 0:17:53,287
You've been taking advantage
of the farting policy.


375
0:17:53,287 --> 0:17:55,447
Hey. Pull my finger.


376
0:17:55,447 --> 0:18:0,47
- l'm not gonna pull your finger.
- See what happens.


377
0:18:0,47 --> 0:18:2,567
l pooed a little.


378
0:18:2,567 --> 0:18:4,7
Dr Kelso.


379
0:18:4,7 --> 0:18:6,7
Well, if it isn't Daddy's little girl.


380
0:18:6,7 --> 0:18:8,87
l wanted to tell you
what happened to me.


381
0:18:8,87 --> 0:18:10,327
l'm going to keep eating my soup,


382
0:18:10,327 --> 0:18:13,327
but you rest assured
l'm holding my breath on the inside.


383
0:18:13,327 --> 0:18:15,887
First, l came out to my mother.


384
0:18:15,887 --> 0:18:17,7
Well, then,


385
0:18:17,7 --> 0:18:20,967
it appears the boys in radiology
owe me quite a bit of money.


386
0:18:20,967 --> 0:18:22,647
But this afternoon...


387
0:18:22,647 --> 0:18:25,447
<i>,,,a patient puked on me,</i>


388
0:18:25,447 --> 0:18:28,87
<i>And I smiled,</i>


389
0:18:28,87 --> 0:18:29,967
Do you know why l was smiling?


390
0:18:29,967 --> 0:18:31,847
Because l really like what l do.


391
0:18:31,847 --> 0:18:34,527
You were right. l got into this
for the wrong reasons.


392
0:18:34,527 --> 0:18:37,567
But now that l'm here, l can't
imagine being anywhere else.


393
0:18:37,567 --> 0:18:40,207
l still don't like your father.


394
0:18:40,207 --> 0:18:42,327
Oh, me neither, sir.


395
0:18:42,327 --> 0:18:48,247
Oh. They were all out.


396
0:18:48,247 --> 0:18:52,7
Placement of the stent in haemodynamic
results of PTA are inadequate.


397
0:18:52,7 --> 0:18:54,927
Or primary stent placement
at the initial time of PTA...


398
0:18:54,927 --> 0:18:58,407
<i>Maybe the mistake we make</i>
<i>is thinking our parents will change,</i>


399
0:18:58,407 --> 0:19:1,247
<i>And maybe they did a betterjob</i>
<i>than we give them credit for,</i>


400
0:19:1,247 --> 0:19:3,807
<i>Maybe there</i>
<i>amid all the crap they dumped on us</i>


401
0:19:3,807 --> 0:19:5,447
<i>are some things worth keeping,</i>


402
0:19:5,447 --> 0:19:8,87
<i>Like a passion for something</i>
<i>you never knew you had,</i>


403
0:19:8,87 --> 0:19:10,87
...recent trial of 283 patients...


404
0:19:10,87 --> 0:19:13,367
<i>Or the ability to surround</i>
<i>yourself with people who love you,</i>


405
0:19:13,367 --> 0:19:17,367
...subsequent stent placement
only increases... ln conclusion,


406
0:19:17,367 --> 0:19:19,847
the difference between the strategies


407
0:19:19,847 --> 0:19:24,47
is not significant at either
short-term or long-term follow-up.


408
0:19:24,47 --> 0:19:38,767
Thank you very much, folks,
we've been great.


409
0:19:38,767 --> 0:19:41,487
And ''Z'' is for the Zs
that you'll be getting


410
0:19:41,487 --> 0:19:45,687
cos you now know
heart murmurs from A to Z.


411
0:19:45,687 --> 0:19:50,167
Thank you.


412
0:19:50,167 --> 0:19:53,807
- What are you doing here?
- l just figured l'd come, check it out.


413
0:19:53,807 --> 0:19:56,287
You know, see how you're doing.


414
0:19:56,287 --> 0:19:58,327
And for the record,
that was atrocious.


415
0:19:58,327 --> 0:19:59,887
l mean, downright abysmal.


416
0:19:59,887 --> 0:20:1,807
l know, but did you
see A through K?


417
0:20:1,807 --> 0:20:3,727
l did a cool thing with A through K.


418
0:20:3,727 --> 0:20:8,87
l showed up at Y,
as in ''Why, dear God? Why?''


419
0:20:8,87 --> 0:20:10,47
You know, this has got to be


420
0:20:10,47 --> 0:20:12,647
the most piss-poor,
sorry excuse for a hospital


421
0:20:12,647 --> 0:20:14,847
that l have ever set foot in.


422
0:20:14,847 --> 0:20:18,927
Well, Dad, in that case, feel free
not to stop by every day you're in town.


423
0:20:18,927 --> 0:20:22,167
Goodbye, Son.


424
0:20:22,167 --> 0:20:24,327
l'll see you tomorrow.


425
0:20:24,327 --> 0:20:27,567
Yeah.


426
0:20:27,567 --> 0:20:29,527
Parents, huh?


427
0:20:29,527 --> 0:20:31,127
Tell me about it.


428
0:20:31,127 --> 0:20:33,527
Yeah. What's that,
a shot at my dad?


429
0:20:33,527 --> 0:20:35,447
That's stepping
over the line, pal.


430
0:20:35,447 --> 0:20:38,767
l missed this.


431
0:20:38,767 --> 0:22:38,767
Yeah.
