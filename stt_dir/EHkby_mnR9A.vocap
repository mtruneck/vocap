###5 JOE CROW RYAN: It's very important to be able to
###7 exercise indifference to anything if you're going to
###9 enjoy your stay in Brooklyn.
###11 And we know you're not all from here.
###14 And that's OK.
###15 We're famous for that.
###16 Thank you.
###17 [WHISTLING]
###28 JUSTIN REMER: In 2007, I saw Joe playing at his stop at the
###33 Metropolitan G train stop, and he pretty much said to me, in
###39 not so many words, that he was homeless.
###40 
###45 JOE CROW RYAN: A lot of the songs I sing don't come from
###48 me personally.
###51 They're characters who are singing the song.
###54 But it comes from my understanding of truth.
###58 
###61 JUSTIN REMER: He's doing something that's so totally
###64 his own that it catches your attention.
###68 JOE CROW RYAN: And I always thought that somehow, poverty
###71 was a virtue.
###72 So being in a level of performance that's not
###75 particularly remunerative, I do make barely
###79 enough to get by.
###79 But that somehow suits my temperament.
###82 
###87 If there is a will of God, if there is a "supposed to be,"
###91 what you're doing right now, what I'm doing right now is
###93 what I'm supposed to be doing.
###96 STATION ATTENDANT: Gentleman with the baggage, you need to
###101 come over here.
###102 JOE CROW RYAN: A voice from above.
###103 
###106 Are there any requests?
###107 
###129 Hi, I'm Joe Crow Ryan.
###132 I'm a busker in New York City, and a performer in general.
###136 Train solo!
###138 
###141 NARRATOR: Joe Crow Ryan, born Joseph W. Ryan, came into this
###144 world on August 6th, 1955.
###147 He hails from 183rd Street in the Bronx.
###149 JOE CROW RYAN: My mom died when I was 13.
###153 And when I was 15, we moved to Rockland County.
###156 I started playing guitar a little bit and totally sucked.
###163 Then I got another guitar while I was in high school,
###165 and I wrote my first song.
###167 I wrote a love song for my girlfriend, and she begged me,
###170 please don't play that in front of people.
###173 Not because it was a horrible song, but because I didn't
###176 realize I was just inept and inadequate as a
###179 performer at the time.
###181 
###186 But guitar, I played it a little bit for a long enough
###191 time that I eventually became competent.
###195 Yeah, I'd always like the odd-ball performers because
###199 nobody else really cared for them.
###201 They were weird.
###202 And I liked it a lot and tried to get my friends to listen,
###205 and nobody was really impressed with that.
###207 
###210 But, I guess it formed me as being a
###215 different kind of musician.
###216 
###219 JOE CROW RYAN: Oh, my gosh.
###221 Jobs in my life.
###223 Well, my first real job was before we
###226 moved out of the Bronx.
###227 I was a delivery boy for a drug store.
###230 I worked at about four Friendly Ice Cream stores.
###235 And I've worked in a couple of nursing homes and a good
###240 handful of hospitals as a nurse assistant.
###244 Well, I liked working in the hospital because it was a nice
###248 thing to do for people.
###250 They needed help.
###251 Again, it's, you know, person to person, and it's
###254 also kind of macho.
###256 Like I don't think that Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever wiped
###260 poop off anybody's butt.
###262 I don't think he's ever cleaned a homeless lady in an
###265 emergency room.
###267 I'd worked there for about four years, this North Shore
###271 University Hospital.
###273 And then, they came to us one day and said, we're going to
###278 have a new personnel program called re-engineering.
###282 What I heard was re-engineering.
###285 The first thought was, I'm not a machine, OK.
###288 And then I noticed that even though the insurance companies
###291 weren't paying for the day before surgery and
###294 establishing the healing milieu, they would pay for end
###299 of life extension.
###301 So I noticed this, and I mentioned
###303 it to the head nurse.
###304 I said, you know, 26 to 32 are all people who should be dead.
###311 You know, it's their time.
###313 That just is weird, isn't it?
###316 It's not right.
###317 She said, well, yeah, it's kind of--
###320 that is funny.
###322 But then the next day, the head nurse of all head nurses
###325 in the hospital called me to her office and in essence
###328 said, well, maybe you should take a month off.
###332 So I let that pass, and I talked with the psychiatric
###335 nurse, and she wanted to prescribe medicine for me
###338 right away.
###339 I said, I don't need medicine.
###342 Let's talk.
###343 So we got into the idea of stages of life, end stage of
###347 life, and also got into the idea of re-engineering.
###352 Because that did bother me, and I explained to her that
###355 I'm not a machine.
###356 I'm a human.
###357 And she said, but it's just a word.
###361 And I said, but it means something.
###364 And then I asked her, I said, have you
###366 ever read Kurt Vonnegut?
###368 And she said, no, what does that have to do with anything?
###371 And I said, you know--
###373 I'm done with jobs.
###375 Jobs are done with me.
###377 Who would hire me?
###379 If somebody wanted to hire me, they could come over to me and
###381 tell me, "Joe Crow, I would like to hire you." I'm not
###383 gonna go out to a stranger and say, "Hi, I'm pretending to be
###387 somebody who you'd like to hire, and I'm pretending
###389 you're somebody I would like to work for." That's not it.
###393 It works out because otherwise, I'd be a nurse.
###397 But the outcome of this experience
###400 was, I became homeless.
###402 NARRATOR: From April to September of 2007, Joe was
###406 left homeless and slept in both Prospect Park and the
###408 Brooklyn subways.
###409 [SINGING "WILL THE CIRCLE BE UNBROKEN"]
###410 
###428 JUSTIN REMER: In 2007, I saw Joe playing at his stop at the
###432 Metropolitan G train stop.
###435 And I was talking to him, and he pretty much said to me, in
###441 not so many words, that he was homeless.
###443 The apartment that he'd been living in, he couldn't afford
###446 to stay in anymore, so he didn't have anywhere to go.
###448 JOE CROW RYAN: And Justin was there one night, and I asked
###451 if he had a couch.
###453 JUSTIN REMER: I decided to give him a couch to crash on
###455 for a time.
###456 And the place that he had been working with, he had had a
###459 conflict with them, and basically, it ended in a
###463 pay-off, which wound up being enough for him to actually pay
###468 rent at my apartment for five months.
###471 And one of my other roommates moved out right at that time,
###473 so Joe moved in.
###475 And we've been roommates since then.
###478 So, five years as my roommate.
###481 JOE CROW RYAN: I was talking with a young woman at Project
###484 Parlor recently.
###485 She loves Doctor Zhivago.
###488 And we were talking a little bit about Doctor Zhivago.
###491 And she said, oh yeah, I have a copy of it.
###496 I watch it every year.
###498 And I said, oh, I saw that in the movie theater.
###502 And I thought, oh, yeah, I am older than you, aren't I?
###507 JUSTIN REMER: But don't feel too bad because I felt the
###510 same way talking about Total Recall, the original, the
###513 other day, so we're both old.
###516 JOE CROW RYAN: Yeah.
###517 [LAUGHTER]
###519 JUSTIN REMER: Joe is just the kind of guy.
###521 He's a ham.
###523 Like he's always playing music.
###524 He's always telling his stories.
###526 So if you're in the apartment, Joe is there, giving you his
###529 Joe Crow goodness.
###533 [SINGING]
###551 JUSTIN REMER: It became the kind of thing where me and my
###554 roommates would say to teach other, like, it's a shame.
###558 Joe really needs to be documented, like we need to
###560 have Joe Crow on CD or something.
###564 [SINGING]
###573 JUSTIN REMER: And apparently, we must've been thinking at
###575 the same time as another friend of ours, named Michael
###577 Campbell, who had said to Joe, "Joe, I'm getting you in the
###580 studio, and I'm gonna record you."
###582 [SINGING "DID YOU PUT A SPELL ON ME?"]
###583 
###591 JUSTIN REMER: And Michael recorded Joe.
###594 In one day, he knocked out like 25 songs, I wanna say?
###598 So, what we did is, one of my other friends Doug, who plays
###602 in my band, he went to the subway, and he started
###604 recording Joe on the subway.
###606 And we also started recording his shows at the sidewalk.
###611 And we started to mix them all up, and the CDs are a mixture
###614 of that studio stuff that Michael did, live shows that
###618 we got, and also, just Joe playing in the subway, which
###621 is kind of Joe in his element.
###622 [SINGING "DID YOU PUT A SPELL ON ME?"]
###624 
###637 JUSTIN REMER: And Joe gave it to me and was like, what do
###639 you think, do you wanna help me put this out?
###642 And I listened to it, and I thought it was great.
###646 NARRATOR: Joe Crow Ryan and Justin Remer are currently
###648 working on their third album, which is titled This Machine
###651 Kills Purists, Volume Three, Part One, No More Ironing.
###652 
###655 It is currently scheduled to be released
###657 in the fall of 2012.
###659 JOE CROW RYAN: By the way, tonight's subway busk--
###663 I am Joe Crow Ryan, I should mention.
###665 I'm Joe Crow Ryan.
###666 Tonight's Sunday busk is in celebration of the release of
###670 a single, a digital single.
###673 And I have free download slips for that.
###678 If you'd like to hear the song, "My Arrest."
###681 It might be a little while yet to the next train, so I'll
###683 proceed to play "My Arrest." We'll take
###688 questions after the song.
###690 Whether there are questions or not, we'll take them.
###694 JUSTIN REMER: So, the day before May Day, we had about
###698 bunch of cops bust down our door.
###701 JOE CROW RYAN: About five or six plainclothes warrant
###705 detectives came into our apartment and woke us up.
###708 JUSTIN REMER: Like they didn't ask to come in.
###709 We were asleep.
###710 It was like 6:00 in the morning.
###712 They bust down our door.
###713 JOE CROW RYAN: I think these guys were all intelligence,
###717 NYPD intelligence assigned to warrants for this maneuver.
###721 JUSTIN REMER: They rouse us all out of bed.
###722 They round us up in the living room, and then they start
###725 reading through warrants, and then they're like,
###727 is Joseph Ryan here?
###728 And then he's like, I'm Joseph Ryan.
###731 And they're like, OK, well we're here for you.
###733 JOE CROW RYAN: I said, well look, I knew--
###735 I thought I was going to be going to
###738 Schermerhorn Jail for 24 hours.
###740 That's what I thought was gonna happen.
###742 And they put me in handcuffs, got me into the car.
###745 And the first thing they started asking was about my
###747 roommate Zach.
###748 So he said, well, is he doing anything for May Day?
###751 I said, I don't think so.
###753 They said, well isn't he one of those Occupieds?
###755 Isn't he gonna be at an Occupy event?
###758 I said, no, Zach is not in Occupy, which he's not.
###761 It turns out, he doesn't even like Occupy on Facebook.
###765 JUSTIN REMER: And then, meanwhile, they took my
###767 roommate off to another room, the one who'd been arrested
###770 before, to interrogate him about May Day.
###773 So that was why they were there.
###776 But the reason they claim they were there was for this
###781 five-year-old open beer ticket.
###783 JOE CROW RYAN: Like I had drunk beer outside in 2007,
###789 and I stopped drinking in September 28th, 2007.
###795 And I haven't drunk alcohol since.
###798 Thank you.
###801 JUSTIN REMER: And that's the thing, is that when Joe moved
###803 into my apartment, he gave up booze.
###805 And he's actually stayed sober without a program, which is
###808 kind of an achievement.
###810 JOE CROW RYAN: So, Ray Kelly had no idea I was, A, alive,
###816 B, living here.
###819 If I had $50 to pay for the summonses--
###823 didn't matter to him, all he wanted--
###825 and I'll tell you, this Ray Kelly, and you
###828 tell me if I'm wrong.
###829 You just wanted your intelligence people to get
###832 into the houses of the six people who were arrested at
###837 this party that was escalated into a riot.
###840 I don't know what cops think we're up to.
###841 We're artists types.
###844 We're the good guys.
###845 Ray, we're the good guys.
###846 [SINGING "MY ARREST"]
###864 JUSTIN REMER: So, Joe being Joe, he turned this story into
###868 this elaborate song piece.
###873 Very funny.
###875 And he would play it at the open mic where he hosts the
###879 Tuesday Teacup, it's called Goodbye Blue Monday.
###881 
###885 JOE CROW RYAN: Shamelessness is necessary for the enjoyment
###888 of the performing life.
###889 DAN COSTELLO: No, sorry I said--
###889 JOE CROW RYAN: No, we replace that with what we meant in the
###891 first place, which is, kick ass.
###893 DAN COSTELLO: That's what we meant.
###894 Kick ass.
###894 JOE CROW RYAN: Be yourself.
###896 Kick ass.
###897 Play your heart out.
###898 DAN COSTELLO: Somebody said, I'm just starting.
###899 I'm just starting.
###900 Well, kick ass at just starting.
###901 JOE CROW RYAN: You've always wanted to be
###902 awesome in your life.
###902 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###904 
###922 JUSTIN REMER: The people that come to that open mic are such
###927 a family, that they're like, Joe, that's a great song,
###931 like, are you gona record that?
###932 Is that gonna go on the new album and all that stuff?
###935 And it actually kind of came together through those
###939 connections, like through that family.
###941 [SINGING]
###952 JUSTIN REMER: Aron Blue recorded it in her home
###955 studio, and those people are mostly just people from the
###959 Tuesday Teacup who were like, yeah, Joe, we'll play bass.
###962 We'll play uke.
###963 We'll play drums.
###964 We'll sing in a back-up choir.
###967 And it's kind of just pure magic.
###973 [SINGING "MY ARREST"]
###983 JOE CROW RYAN: And it turns out good.
###985 That's the luck of the Irish is that I got arrested, and my
###990 shoulders got bent out of whack, and I was able to get
###994 involved with a great song, a great room of loving friends
###999 who wanted to be there and play this song and record it.
###1004 And it's a great video.
###1006 JUSTIN REMER: So I don't know.
###1007 Joe found the silver lining in it, which was that it made for
###1011 a good song story.
###1013 
###1017 JOE CROW RYAN: Let's hear that.
###1018 Let's hear that one.
###1020 
###1027 JUSTIN REMER: What's that weird, sad fish aroma?
###1031 
###1033 Or something.
###1035 JOE CROW RYAN: Oh, this is my warm-up.
###1036 I didn't do my warm-up for you.
###1039 I paid for a guitar lesson once.
###1042 So, a big part of my philosophy comes from my
###1045 dealing with Jesus, is that everything's all right.
###1048 A lot of times, I kvetch inside because things are some
###1053 way or another, and even though poverty suits my
###1056 temperament, it's not easy.
###1059 But it'll pass.
###1061 I do dishes before I go out.
###1063 Now my franchise is called This Machine Kills Purists.
###1068 But to me, I am a purist in the way I do dishes, if I'm a
###1073 purist about anything.
###1076 And you do them all like this.
###1078
