0:2:48,849 --> 0:2:50,79
started more


41
0:2:50,79 --> 0:2:54,709
hundred years ago


42
0:2:54,709 --> 0:3:2,869
in the aftermath of the great san
francisco perth quake of nineteen oh six


43
0:3:2,869 --> 0:3:8,729
earthquake struggle on wednesday just

latter-day explorers couldn't understand

0:4:12,819 --> 0:4:19,379
speakers shop around me from explosions
or under the grounds friends


60
0:4:19,379 --> 0:4:20,789
three hundred years later


61
0:4:20,789 --> 0:4:23,699
and sciences still made little progress


62
0:4:23,699 --> 0:4:28,169
refugees in the ruins of san francisco's
still blamed earthquakes on mysterious


63
0:4:28,169 --> 0:4:34,49
underground explosions


64
0:4:34,49 --> 0:4:38,979
so just three days after the earthquake
the state of california asked one of the


65
0:4:38,979 --> 0:4:41,18
world's most famous geologists


66
0:4:41,18 --> 0:4:45,45
andrew lost from california state
university to investigate what had


67
0:4:45,45 --> 0:4:49,16
destroyed the city


68
0:4:49,16 --> 0:4:53,77
he and a team of twenty five scientists
began collecting damage evidence


69
0:4:53,77 --> 0:4:56,969
this city and surrounding countryside


70
0:4:56,969 --> 0:5:0,159
there were roads that had balked


71
0:5:0,159 --> 0:5:3,559
rail tracks that had twisted


72
0:5:3,559 --> 0:5:6,68
the most startling evidence of all


73
0:5:6,68 --> 0:5:12,889
that came near the town of police barren
county to the north of san francisco


74
0:5:12,889 --> 0:5:17,639
this picket fence haddon eight-foot get
in the middle


75
0:5:17,639 --> 0:5:20,18
before the earthquake it was a solid
boundaries


76
0:5:20,18 --> 0:5:24,9
it's dividing two feet


77
0:5:24,9 --> 0:5:26,29
when he recreated what had happened


78
0:5:26,29 --> 0:5:29,159
lawson realize the full length add fuel
to the park


79
0:5:29,159 --> 0:5:34,569
and torn the fence into


80
0:5:34,569 --> 0:5:35,409
plotting the other


81
0:5:35,409 --> 0:5:38,249
as on a map around san francisco


82
0:5:38,249 --> 0:5:42,9
surprising have


83
0:5:42,9 --> 0:5:44,189
because connecting the dots


84
0:5:44,189 --> 0:5:47,0
drew a straight line


85
0:5:47,0 --> 0:5:48,539
and that every point


86
0:5:48,539 --> 0:5:50,24
the birth


87
0:5:50,24 --> 0:5:51,879
the same way


88
0:5:51,879 --> 0:5:55,99
on the coast to the north


89
0:5:55,99 --> 0:6:1,729
this line of weakness was the culprit
they were searching for


90
0:6:1,729 --> 0:6:5,499
south of san francisco the suspect line
ran under the family


91
0:6:5,499 --> 0:6:7,71
the laguna dicen andreas


92
0:6:7,71 --> 0:6:13,409
so now the earthquake perpetrator atlast
had a name


93
0:6:13,409 --> 0:6:17,509
professor lawson who a decade earlier
had identified cracks in the earth here


94
0:6:17,509 --> 0:6:21,189
as a harmless rift now re christened it


95
0:6:21,189 --> 0:6:26,689
san andreas fault


96
0:6:26,689 --> 0:6:30,4
in modern-day san francisco the
buildings the roads in the railways have


97
0:6:30,4 --> 0:6:32,589
long since been repeated


98
0:6:32,589 --> 0:6:36,59
but if you know where to look evidence
of the nineteen oh six point


99
0:6:36,59 --> 0:6:40,749
still be found


100
0:6:40,749 --> 0:6:45,369
geologist charlie paul files in the
footsteps of loss in st seeking signs of


101
0:6:45,369 --> 0:6:50,759
the habit from nineteen oh six


102
0:6:50,759 --> 0:6:56,439
he finds it on the cliffs that muscle
rock twelve miles south of san francisco


103
0:6:56,439 --> 0:7:0,74
the class is not here by accident by the
very good reason why this witness here


104
0:7:0,74 --> 0:7:4,499
half a mile or so love the short face
apparently fell off


105
0:7:4,499 --> 0:7:8,519
in the nineteen oh six earthquake and if
you look down below us is big located


106
0:7:8,519 --> 0:7:13,88
block on that's near the present-day
short line and isn't she s


107
0:7:13,88 --> 0:7:14,84
anymore


108
0:7:14,84 --> 0:7:17,58
on this and this fall the san andreas
fault is up


109
0:7:17,58 --> 0:7:20,0
about quarter mile offshore airports


110
0:7:20,0 --> 0:7:24,76
that's one of the major crustal
junctions sab on the side of north


111
0:7:24,76 --> 0:7:29,499
america


112
0:7:29,499 --> 0:7:34,71
modern computers canal trace how damage
weeks read out across the city


113
0:7:34,71 --> 0:7:43,809
and that can points where the quake
originated along the san andreas


114
0:7:43,809 --> 0:7:50,269
it was offshore about two miles out to
sea from the golden gate bridge


115
0:7:50,269 --> 0:7:56,739
so to continue tracking the fault of the
investigation must head out to sea


116
0:7:56,739 --> 0:8:1,599
marine geologists use remote operating
vehicles many submarines to map the


117
0:8:1,599 --> 0:8:3,909
season


118
0:8:3,909 --> 0:8:8,54
what you see is subtle variations in the
photography of hypocrisy that would not


119
0:8:8,54 --> 0:8:10,84
naturally lineup


120
0:8:10,84 --> 0:8:15,8
for there might be a line on the ocean
floor the is higher or lower on one side


121
0:8:15,8 --> 0:8:16,479
and you can


122
0:8:16,479 --> 0:8:18,18
use various


123
0:8:18,18 --> 0:8:20,75
to determine that this actually is a
fall


124
0:8:20,75 --> 0:8:23,669
instead of some of the process


125
0:8:23,669 --> 0:8:25,55
running south across the sea there


126
0:8:25,55 --> 0:8:28,389
the san andreas finally runs out of
ocean


127
0:8:28,389 --> 0:8:30,979
and hits the land


128
0:8:30,979 --> 0:8:35,479
this broken line of rocks stretching
infancy marks where the sender andreas


129
0:8:35,479 --> 0:8:41,29
hits land twelve miles south sent


130
0:8:41,29 --> 0:8:45,84
well here are a lot for walk enforce
actually standing on the same day at


131
0:8:45,84 --> 0:8:47,86
fault right now and


132
0:8:47,86 --> 0:8:50,539
uh... yes there was an earthquake i
don't know what happened


133
0:8:50,539 --> 0:8:55,58
right here but i want one of the year


134
0:8:55,58 --> 0:8:57,279
this pacific coastline


135
0:8:57,279 --> 0:8:59,95
where clips crumble slowly into the sea


136
0:8:59,95 --> 0:9:7,45
is the boundary between two the earth's
massive continental plates


137
0:9:7,45 --> 0:9:12,36
separated by the san andreas fault to
vast separate blocks of the earths crust


138
0:9:12,36 --> 0:9:18,31
fly directly alongside each other


139
0:9:18,31 --> 0:9:22,11
here at the continent of north america
by slightly on top of the adjacent


140
0:9:22,11 --> 0:9:32,13
section of cross which holds the pacific
ocean


141
0:9:32,13 --> 0:9:33,48
join can be seen


142
0:9:33,48 --> 0:9:37,58
with these lower darker rocks are
overlay by light colored said amenorrhea


143
0:9:37,58 --> 0:9:39,64
rocks


144
0:9:39,64 --> 0:9:41,26
is what type of everybody


145
0:9:41,26 --> 0:9:45,72
body out more than a hundred million
years amazing to walk bodies that that


146
0:9:45,72 --> 0:9:50,29
are not someone anyway they brought
together


147
0:9:50,29 --> 0:9:54,37
the fault line was exposed to geologists
when the cliffs collapsed here in the


148
0:9:54,37 --> 0:9:57,73
nineteen oh six earthquake


149
0:9:57,73 --> 0:9:59,3
but back then


150
0:9:59,3 --> 0:10:1,92
nobody understood how and why


151
0:10:1,92 --> 0:10:3,72
two different types of rocks


152
0:10:3,72 --> 0:10:6,59
when next to each other


153
0:10:6,59 --> 0:10:9,22
until around forty years ago


154
0:10:9,22 --> 0:10:10,19
when the answer


155
0:10:10,19 --> 0:10:11,71
finally with the


156
0:10:11,71 --> 0:10:12,74
by the theory


157
0:10:12,74 --> 0:10:16,95
affly tektronix


158
0:10:16,95 --> 0:10:22,86
all hearing showed that the earths crust
consists of separate moving plates on


159
0:10:22,86 --> 0:10:26,96
which the oceans and continents it


160
0:10:26,96 --> 0:10:31,15
uh... around two hundred million years
ago they have the pacific ocean played


161
0:10:31,15 --> 0:10:33,9
collided with north america


162
0:10:33,9 --> 0:10:39,44
and started sinking underneath the
lighter com


163
0:10:39,44 --> 0:10:44,5
professor geophysics more sober studies
that process called subduction in his


164
0:10:44,5 --> 0:10:47,98
laboratory at stanford university


165
0:10:47,98 --> 0:10:52,16
for many millions of years prior to the
existence of the senators fault the


166
0:10:52,16 --> 0:10:56,79
pacific plate was some ducting beneath
north america that


167
0:10:56,79 --> 0:10:59,61
fortunately was dying down


168
0:10:59,61 --> 0:11:4,83
uh... that process went on for well well
over a hundred million years so a


169
0:11:4,83 --> 0:11:8,77
tremendous amount of activity was
occurring


170
0:11:8,77 --> 0:11:13,7
as the unstoppable force of one plate
methionine object of the other they were


171
0:11:13,7 --> 0:11:16,75
forced to change direction


172
0:11:16,75 --> 0:11:19,69
about twenty million years ago


173
0:11:19,69 --> 0:11:25,0
claim options were such that the pacific
going to have to start sliding north


174
0:11:25,0 --> 0:11:27,91
with respect to north america and no


175
0:11:27,91 --> 0:11:29,73
you know there's a principal


176
0:11:29,73 --> 0:11:34,41
motion is the sliding process between
the complex and twenty million years ago


177
0:11:34,41 --> 0:11:37,79
the san andreas fault was born


178
0:11:37,79 --> 0:11:41,24
inflates the crushed different types of
rock together


179
0:11:41,24 --> 0:11:46,11
just this year


180
0:11:46,11 --> 0:11:52,75
atlast the investigation knows what it
is dealing with


181
0:11:52,75 --> 0:11:56,34
the san andreas falls is eight hundred
miles long


182
0:11:56,34 --> 0:11:58,92
emerging from the seat at north of point
arena


183
0:11:58,92 --> 0:12:0,49
in northern california


184
0:12:0,49 --> 0:12:6,13
and running down to the solvency


185
0:12:6,13 --> 0:12:9,31
the evidence is coming together


186
0:12:9,31 --> 0:12:13,67
from the nineteen oh six earthquake such
as the picket fence that was torn apart


187
0:12:13,67 --> 0:12:14,63
fruit


188
0:12:14,63 --> 0:12:17,86
but the land was moved


189
0:12:17,86 --> 0:12:20,9
connecting the dots identifies the
screen


190
0:12:20,9 --> 0:12:25,63
the san andreas falls


191
0:12:25,63 --> 0:12:26,71
muscle rock


192
0:12:26,71 --> 0:12:34,4
uncovers different plates of the earths
crust on either side fault


193
0:12:34,4 --> 0:12:35,439
but investigators still


194
0:12:35,439 --> 0:12:37,97
need more information about how off


195
0:12:37,97 --> 0:12:40,31
san andreas has spawned birthplace


196
0:12:40,31 --> 0:12:43,93
the past


197
0:12:43,93 --> 0:12:48,2
it might help answered the all-important
question


198
0:12:48,2 --> 0:12:56,46
well the san andreas strike again


199
0:12:56,46 --> 0:13:1,32
to discover when the senator is fault
will strike again investigation needs to


200
0:13:1,32 --> 0:13:8,78
know about ancient earthquakes that have
struck along the fault line


201
0:13:8,78 --> 0:13:11,61
that there's anything wrong


202
0:13:11,61 --> 0:13:15,2
here in california to particular
challenge that some of her lawyers


203
0:13:15,2 --> 0:13:19,1
written records were from the missions
and from the early explorers only dating


204
0:13:19,1 --> 0:13:21,5
back into the eighteenth century here


205
0:13:21,5 --> 0:13:26,3
whether parts of the world we have a
quick history going back no one


206
0:13:26,3 --> 0:13:30,42
the investigation will stream of the
fifty miles south of san francisco two

208
0:13:31,44 --> 0:13:37,56

karen


210
0:13:39,4 --> 0:13:45,18
this crucial evidence here about
prescription patient eyes


211
0:13:45,18 --> 0:13:49,15
this creek used to four straight across
the center is fault here


212
0:13:49,15 --> 0:13:51,6
but several earthquakes form natural
there


213
0:13:51,6 --> 0:13:55,21
am where the san andreas falter wedges
up here in front of me


214
0:13:55,21 --> 0:14:0,61
that created a small pond and now we're
looking at the dr sentiments about time


215
0:14:0,61 --> 0:14:1,87
that record


216
0:14:1,87 --> 0:14:4,83
the history of earthquakes and that
tells us quite a great deal about the


217
0:14:4,83 --> 0:14:8,82
past behavior the san andreas fault


218
0:14:8,82 --> 0:14:13,23
some of the twins are so small without
notes detective work gets in town and


219
0:14:13,23 --> 0:14:19,65
dusty among tiny cracks insightful that
sometimes we can find out about the past


220
0:14:19,65 --> 0:14:24,77
behavior in the san andreas fall by
looking at the tiniest details


221
0:14:24,77 --> 0:14:27,55
at the bottom of this year old ajun
party


222
0:14:27,55 --> 0:14:31,98
mugs sediments collected above a fine
line of pebbles


223
0:14:31,98 --> 0:14:36,74
then denver's wage shifted the land
upwards on one side of the vertical for


224
0:14:36,74 --> 0:14:38,94
one


225
0:14:38,94 --> 0:14:42,27
service where was originally flat and
then


226
0:14:42,27 --> 0:14:46,82
and subsequent earthquake it was broken
lying there so honest tiny fracture


227
0:14:46,82 --> 0:14:49,11
strand of the senator is false


228
0:14:49,11 --> 0:14:53,48
but finding proof that this is the site
of an ancient earthquake is only part of


229
0:14:53,48 --> 0:14:55,4
the story


230
0:14:55,4 --> 0:14:59,46
i've not needs to know how long ago it
happened


231
0:14:59,46 --> 0:15:3,72
the bear rock layers of no help in
dating is find but just above the


232
0:15:3,72 --> 0:15:9,21
fracture line of the rocks he has found
the evidence he needs


233
0:15:9,21 --> 0:15:10,9
here


234
0:15:10,9 --> 0:15:13,17
a bush was burned by a prehistoric
wildfire


235
0:15:13,17 --> 0:15:16,93
and that remnant of carmen is why you
see this black stain on the side of the


236
0:15:16,93 --> 0:15:19,0
trend toward


237
0:15:19,0 --> 0:15:23,25
the key to unlock the needs of the rocks
is carbon fourteen


238
0:15:23,25 --> 0:15:26,15
moment radiocarbon


239
0:15:26,15 --> 0:15:31,25
its molecular structure means the carbon
fourteen is a more unstable isotoner and


240
0:15:31,25 --> 0:15:33,12
other forms of carbon


241
0:15:33,12 --> 0:15:38,16
it's absorbed by growing plants and
radioactivity decays loan rates after


242
0:15:38,16 --> 0:15:39,78
the plant dies


243
0:15:39,78 --> 0:15:44,53
so measuring carbon fourteen and
vegetation burned in a wildfire reveals


244
0:15:44,53 --> 0:15:47,179
how long ago those plants died


245
0:15:47,179 --> 0:15:51,67
dates the rock in which the carbon is
found


246
0:15:51,67 --> 0:15:56,75
and through this week and reconstruct
the evidence of the past earthquakes


247
0:15:56,75 --> 0:15:59,3
radiocarbon dating is true

because mcallen straight across called

287
0:18:36,82 --> 0:18:41,4
earlier investigators had already
radiocarbon dated the land on each side


288
0:18:41,4 --> 0:18:42,659
of the folks here


289
0:18:42,659 --> 0:18:49,59
revealing that it took three thousand
years to change the creeks position


290
0:18:49,59 --> 0:18:54,58
so knowing the distance and the time it
took to do with let's hope not calculate


291
0:18:54,58 --> 0:19:1,8
the average the with which the to land
masses are moving past each other


292
0:19:1,8 --> 0:19:3,39
three hundred feet


293
0:19:3,39 --> 0:19:7,44
in three thousand years


294
0:19:7,44 --> 0:19:9,89
look for decades


295
0:19:9,89 --> 0:19:11,179
just over a cage


296
0:19:11,179 --> 0:19:13,22
year


297
0:19:13,22 --> 0:19:15,52
but this was never is


298
0:19:15,52 --> 0:19:17,27
one each year move


299
0:19:17,27 --> 0:19:18,32
reality


300
0:19:18,32 --> 0:19:19,38
was a series


301
0:19:19,38 --> 0:19:21,38
so if you small jobs


302
0:19:21,38 --> 0:19:25,73
whenever tension builds up enough but
remix and moving planes overcome


303
0:19:25,73 --> 0:19:28,76
friction between the rock


304
0:19:28,76 --> 0:19:33,37
the land of garner support


305
0:19:33,37 --> 0:19:37,39
it's an important moment for the
investigation


306
0:19:37,39 --> 0:19:42,51
knowing how fast the land is moving not
only reviews the stress that's building


307
0:19:42,51 --> 0:19:43,57
up


308
0:19:43,57 --> 0:19:51,81

309
0:19:51,81 --> 0:19:56,64
percent interest falls is getting a bit
sequence


310
0:19:56,64 --> 0:19:57,99

311
0:19:57,99 --> 0:20:2,49

313
0:20:6,92 --> 0:20:8,57
dinner with them


314
0:20:8,57 --> 0:20:13,58
how fast the plates are moving along the
san andreas


315
0:20:13,58 --> 0:20:19,2
now investigation has a new districts
all


316
0:20:19,2 --> 0:20:23,42
people and along the san andreas is
moving one inch every


317
0:20:23,42 --> 0:20:25,12
causing earthquakes


318
0:20:25,12 --> 0:20:26,35
then why


319
0:20:26,35 --> 0:20:38,44
one small town along the fault


320
0:20:38,44 --> 0:20:43,1
investigation has discovered how fast
the land is stretching straining along


321
0:20:43,1 --> 0:20:46,33
each side of the san andreas bombs


322
0:20:46,33 --> 0:20:50,36
wish it would help established when that
ever-increasing stress will soon have


323
0:20:50,36 --> 0:20:51,58
the land apply


324
0:20:51,58 --> 0:20:55,11
next major earthquake


325
0:20:55,11 --> 0:20:56,69
but there's a problem


326
0:20:56,69 --> 0:21:2,32
one part of the fault line just doesn't
fit the pattern


327
0:21:2,32 --> 0:21:7,15
the small town of hollister is unique
along the san andreas fault system


328
0:21:7,15 --> 0:21:9,36
it's never had an earthquake


329
0:21:9,36 --> 0:21:17,92
investigation was going to find out why


330
0:21:17,92 --> 0:21:24,16
hollister has a population of thirty
seven thousand there


331
0:21:24,16 --> 0:21:25,419
and what not


332
0:21:25,419 --> 0:21:29,899
is quite the way it should be


333
0:21:29,899 --> 0:21:33,6
and there are plenty of clues


334
0:21:33,6 --> 0:21:34,17
suggesting that the


335
0:21:34,17 --> 0:21:42,7
and must be moving here


336
0:21:42,7 --> 0:21:44,549
but cracks


337
0:21:44,549 --> 0:21:48,78
christopher way out of line


338
0:21:48,78 --> 0:21:50,71
and out of shape


339
0:21:50,71 --> 0:21:54,59
walking through the hollister wish can
see anything that man has built that was


340
0:21:54,59 --> 0:21:56,32
laid out in a straight line


341
0:21:56,32 --> 0:22:0,65
may have a johnny and that the every
year it changes a little bit of


342
0:22:0,65 --> 0:22:3,8
progressive saying


343
0:22:3,8 --> 0:22:7,46
was losing add up toward conclusion


344
0:22:7,46 --> 0:22:11,69
even without any risk with reverses this
town in the heart of the senator is


345
0:22:11,69 --> 0:22:12,69
system


346
0:22:12,69 --> 0:22:18,59
still slides imperceptibly slowly and
effortlessly along


347
0:22:18,59 --> 0:22:22,14
in one sense that the image that you see
here for share it with the creeping


348
0:22:22,14 --> 0:22:22,919
yourself


349
0:22:22,919 --> 0:22:27,429
is clearly for under control whatever
geologist if you start playing that out


350
0:22:27,429 --> 0:22:31,779
for tens of thousands or hundreds of
thousands or millions of years the


351
0:22:31,779 --> 0:22:34,54
consequences of that become enormously


352
0:22:34,54 --> 0:22:39,13
for many years creeping ground that
moves without earthquakes remained in


353
0:22:39,13 --> 0:22:44,35
unsolved mysteries


354
0:22:44,35 --> 0:22:45,6
then


355
0:22:45,6 --> 0:22:48,639
the investigation moved one hundred
miles south


356
0:22:48,639 --> 0:22:50,38
to another small community


357
0:22:50,38 --> 0:22:56,14
wendell and also creeps along


358
0:22:56,14 --> 0:23:1,83
diligent parkfield has a population of
just thirty seven people and a brief


359
0:23:1,83 --> 0:23:6,929
which spanned right across the san
andreas falls


360
0:23:6,929 --> 0:23:10,99
the bridge separates the pacific plate
on one side


361
0:23:10,99 --> 0:23:14,73
from the north american place on the
other


362
0:23:14,73 --> 0:23:18,89
and agreed railing have started today


363
0:23:18,89 --> 0:23:22,21
i am i right now i'm pacific tori


364
0:23:22,21 --> 0:23:28,1
arnaud west side of the standards for


365
0:23:28,1 --> 0:23:30,99
the sender's comes off before i could
add here or


366
0:23:30,99 --> 0:23:32,37
and right across that


367
0:23:32,37 --> 0:23:35,19
field right under the bridge


368
0:23:35,19 --> 0:23:39,37
read or by the quarter-million transpose
the men are more


369
0:23:39,37 --> 0:23:41,82
the middleman


370
0:23:41,82 --> 0:23:46,49
the movement here around the bridge is
strikingly similar to the slow breeding


371
0:23:46,49 --> 0:23:49,85
ground of hollister


372
0:23:49,85 --> 0:23:53,95
but there is one important difference
here in parkview every couple of decades


373
0:23:53,95 --> 0:23:58,7
uh... this village does have birthplace


374
0:23:58,7 --> 0:24:0,49
they just little tremors


375
0:24:0,49 --> 0:24:9,59
but they're big enough to be recorded on
earthquake monitoring seismographs


376
0:24:9,59 --> 0:24:15,63
that's why the village proudly boasts of
being the earthquake capital of the war


377
0:24:15,63 --> 0:24:19,659
but it's perhaps more accurately called
the earthquake study capital because


378
0:24:19,659 --> 0:24:23,419
scientists are fascinated by the fact
that earthquakes here follow-up


379
0:24:23,419 --> 0:24:28,559
predictable pattern


380
0:24:28,559 --> 0:24:31,51
earthquakes policed right without
warning


381
0:24:31,51 --> 0:24:35,34
patrol of death and destruction made
worse because nobody knew they were


382
0:24:35,34 --> 0:24:37,88
coming


383
0:24:37,88 --> 0:24:42,22
so scientists are desperate for any
clues that might help predict when an


384
0:24:42,22 --> 0:24:45,8
earthquake could happen


385
0:24:45,8 --> 0:24:46,549
and here in parkfield


386
0:24:46,549 --> 0:24:49,91
the earthquakes happen with astonishing
regularity


387
0:24:49,91 --> 0:24:54,19
on average every couple of decades or so


388
0:24:54,19 --> 0:24:57,539
minor quakes happen here eighteen fifty
seven


389
0:24:57,539 --> 0:25:3,34
eighteen eighty one nineteen oh one
nineteen twenty two nineteen thirty four


390
0:25:3,34 --> 0:25:10,669
and nineteen sixty six these after the
sixty six earthquake investigator set-up


391
0:25:10,669 --> 0:25:15,47
a network of monitoring instruments to
see if the fall gave any warning


392
0:25:15,47 --> 0:25:19,279
before the next birthweight arrive


393
0:25:19,279 --> 0:25:22,309
they expected it sometime between
nineteen eighty eight and nineteen


394
0:25:22,309 --> 0:25:25,19
ninety-three but it was late


395
0:25:25,19 --> 0:25:26,519
months of waiting


396
0:25:26,519 --> 0:25:31,4
stretched in two years


397
0:25:31,4 --> 0:25:33,61
this but still


398
0:25:33,61 --> 0:25:36,2
scientists wages


399
0:25:36,2 --> 0:25:39,7
until finally in december two thousand
four


400
0:25:39,7 --> 0:25:41,68
a long-awaited earthquake arise


401
0:25:41,68 --> 0:25:44,49
and was cost on phil


402
0:25:44,49 --> 0:25:53,17
from a now slightly warned and damaged
camera a


403
0:25:53,17 --> 0:25:57,76
the earthquake moving may not have seen
that impressive


404
0:25:57,76 --> 0:26:4,1
but the instruments collected a massive
information


405
0:26:4,1 --> 0:26:7,71
the data didn't after all helped with
earthquake prediction


406
0:26:7,71 --> 0:26:12,27
but it did pinpoint where the earthquake
started underground


407
0:26:12,27 --> 0:26:18,2
which told investigators where to look
next


408
0:26:18,2 --> 0:26:23,0
deep down under the parkfield
countryside


409
0:26:23,0 --> 0:26:25,91
starting slightly to one side of the
falls


410
0:26:25,91 --> 0:26:33,4
the aim was to mandolin and staff into
the very heart of the senate race


411
0:26:33,4 --> 0:26:37,15
three years of drilling long cords of
rock were extracted


412
0:26:37,15 --> 0:26:39,8
in the exact spot


413
0:26:39,8 --> 0:26:41,88
quaker kern


414
0:26:41,88 --> 0:26:46,45
this was the first time teamleader
geologist mark so back had ever seen


415
0:26:46,45 --> 0:26:50,84
rocks from the center of the senate race


416
0:26:50,84 --> 0:26:54,72
what we're looking at here our course
from the active san andreas fault from


417
0:26:54,72 --> 0:26:57,37
and up to about two miles


418
0:26:57,37 --> 0:26:59,49
for the earth science community


419
0:26:59,49 --> 0:27:0,94
these are like moon rocks


420
0:27:0,94 --> 0:27:3,82
as we were trying to assume these course
we had a great


421
0:27:3,82 --> 0:27:4,92
do you love


422
0:27:4,92 --> 0:27:9,52
truly difficulty the san andreas fault
was literally fighting back


423
0:27:9,52 --> 0:27:13,44
after nine weeks of attempting to
recover the colours in the middle of the


424
0:27:13,44 --> 0:27:15,59
huge lightning storm


425
0:27:15,59 --> 0:27:19,57
almost the same directly out of
hollywood with the thunder and lightning


426
0:27:19,57 --> 0:27:20,92
the scores


427
0:27:20,92 --> 0:27:23,15
inferences


428
0:27:23,15 --> 0:27:26,8
since it was a tremendous feeling of
satisfaction


429
0:27:26,8 --> 0:27:30,41
uh... the lightning and thunder just
made it that much more dramatic


430
0:27:30,41 --> 0:27:32,88
and were all wearing gloves


431
0:27:32,88 --> 0:27:36,59
we want equal marketers to affect the
core


432
0:27:36,59 --> 0:27:42,61
and that the war was that you touch the
core as little as possible there


433
0:27:42,61 --> 0:27:45,6
along with this


434
0:27:45,6 --> 0:27:48,72
it's artist you're off


435
0:27:48,72 --> 0:27:52,8
reality was recruitment lifestyles and


436
0:27:52,8 --> 0:27:55,95
it was just such a remarkable thing to
be actually looking at the san andreas


437
0:27:55,95 --> 0:27:56,77
fall


438
0:27:56,77 --> 0:27:58,28
for the very first time


439
0:27:58,28 --> 0:28:1,9
early on got potential


440
0:28:1,9 --> 0:28:5,91
buried within the rock courts they found
a vital clue about the way that lands


441
0:28:5,91 --> 0:28:9,58
lives along the san andreas


442
0:28:9,58 --> 0:28:12,51
bouncer pen tonight


443
0:28:12,51 --> 0:28:14,619
serpentine isn't unusual


444
0:28:14,619 --> 0:28:19,399
rock type it was originally formed i had
a base in the ocean crust an exit wound


445
0:28:19,399 --> 0:28:22,87
up onto the continent but the reason
that september ninth


446
0:28:22,87 --> 0:28:26,309
so interesting is that extra penny is
very


447
0:28:26,309 --> 0:28:32,42
usually alternative helpful i was the
water slide and reinforcements


448
0:28:32,42 --> 0:28:35,1
talcum powder is very slippery


449
0:28:35,1 --> 0:28:36,619
accounts crystalline structure


450
0:28:36,619 --> 0:28:41,44
stall sliding flat plates makes it one
of the slippery a strong sounds of


451
0:28:41,44 --> 0:28:44,83
silence


452
0:28:44,83 --> 0:28:46,98
that helped could well be


453
0:28:46,98 --> 0:28:52,58
uh... lucky mineral in in deciding how
the full is actually working in in


454
0:28:52,58 --> 0:28:57,85
central california we see that the
secrets of the slipping san andreas fall


455
0:28:57,85 --> 0:29:0,19
is actually the walks themselves


456
0:29:0,19 --> 0:29:4,289
metallic explains the tiny earthquakes
in parkfield


457
0:29:4,289 --> 0:29:7,88
nobody's yet drilled to investigate the
rocks that hollister


458
0:29:7,88 --> 0:29:13,43
but scientists suspect the top is
presently


459
0:29:13,43 --> 0:29:18,549
cracks in the wall chill the land creeds
in hollister


460
0:29:18,549 --> 0:29:22,169
an abandoned the bridge reveals the same
creeping ground


461
0:29:22,169 --> 0:29:25,32
in a nearby town


462
0:29:25,32 --> 0:29:28,98
extracted from the fall contains
repentant


463
0:29:28,98 --> 0:29:34,12
leading investigators to the softest and
slippery is minimal


464
0:29:34,12 --> 0:29:37,59
lubricate some parts of the fall


465
0:29:37,59 --> 0:29:41,78
the investigation is having success but
one crucial question remains to be


466
0:29:41,78 --> 0:29:43,37
answered


467
0:29:43,37 --> 0:29:44,97
with the san andreas fall


468
0:29:44,97 --> 0:29:53,94
do next


469
0:29:53,94 --> 0:29:58,21
the investigation into the san andreas
falls is trying to predict when and


470
0:29:58,21 --> 0:30:2,55
where its next major earthquake almost
right


471
0:30:2,55 --> 0:30:7,3
so far the only certain prediction is
the far distant future of the san


472
0:30:7,3 --> 0:30:10,909
andreas


473
0:30:10,909 --> 0:30:13,37
looked twenty million years ahead


474
0:30:13,37 --> 0:30:17,6
if the plague movements continue to
follow their pattern los angeles www end


475
0:30:17,6 --> 0:30:23,309
up becoming a suburb of san francisco


476
0:30:23,309 --> 0:30:28,17
predictions on a short time scale far
more difficult


477
0:30:28,17 --> 0:30:30,639
if you would ask the question


478
0:30:30,639 --> 0:30:35,48
can we predict earthquakes my answer
would be no because i know what your


479
0:30:35,48 --> 0:30:38,25
question really meant


480
0:30:38,25 --> 0:30:43,13
milk and we predicted earthquake is an
approach certain fault at a certain time


481
0:30:43,13 --> 0:30:48,8
that we can specify in the future and we
cannot do that but there are many things


482
0:30:48,8 --> 0:30:51,64
we can't predict we can predict which
faults are likely to produce the big


483
0:30:51,64 --> 0:30:53,56
earthquakes weaken verdict


484
0:30:53,56 --> 0:30:58,29
helping the earthquakes are likely to be
then we can even predict a probability


485
0:30:58,29 --> 0:31:2,76
of the earthquake occurrence over some
period of several decades


486
0:31:2,76 --> 0:31:10,1
predictions are most crucial where the
san andreas runs to the south of l_a_


487
0:31:10,1 --> 0:31:12,25
here in the picture of the valujet


488
0:31:12,25 --> 0:31:16,62
geological evidence of earthquakes
stretches back fifteen hundred years and


489
0:31:16,62 --> 0:31:18,41
more


490
0:31:18,41 --> 0:31:21,17
and they follow our regular pattern


491
0:31:21,17 --> 0:31:25,66
major earthquake strikes herewith
monotonous regularity every two hundred


492
0:31:25,66 --> 0:31:29,18
years


493
0:31:29,18 --> 0:31:32,7
but the latest with is long overdue


494
0:31:32,7 --> 0:31:37,84
there hasn't been an earthquake here for
more than three hundred years


495
0:31:37,84 --> 0:31:39,12
that's a concern


496
0:31:39,12 --> 0:31:43,2
because parts of the san andreas fault
system run straight from fear towards


497
0:31:43,2 --> 0:31:47,43
the city of los angeles


498
0:31:47,43 --> 0:31:50,88
defaults will transmit earthquake shocks
in a straight line


499
0:31:50,88 --> 0:31:54,58
towards california biggest city


500
0:31:54,58 --> 0:31:59,63
geologist fury fiato regularly monitors
on the ground and on either side of the


501
0:31:59,63 --> 0:32:3,23
fault line


502
0:32:3,23 --> 0:32:7,649
p lines up his g_p_s_ equipment
precisely over a series of metal tags


503
0:32:7,649 --> 0:32:13,84
fixed into the ground


504
0:32:13,84 --> 0:32:16,4
this information is crucial for
estimating


505
0:32:16,4 --> 0:32:20,72
how fast the full flexibility and what
is the rate of fiction malaysian of


506
0:32:20,72 --> 0:32:25,81
strain in the crust in other words how
close the crossed is brought to failure


507
0:32:25,81 --> 0:32:29,11
by uh... slipped of the full cadets


508
0:32:29,11 --> 0:32:33,91
repeated alter precise measurements
reveal that land here on the surface


509
0:32:33,91 --> 0:32:37,3
hardly moves at all this is a problem


510
0:32:37,3 --> 0:32:38,96
because deep underground


511
0:32:38,96 --> 0:32:43,81
stresses and strains are still building
the could fall there's little doubt that


512
0:32:43,81 --> 0:32:48,36
the fairly high speed elders deformation
was growing and growing anger always


513
0:32:48,36 --> 0:32:50,77
talking


514
0:32:50,77 --> 0:32:56,12
xxx miles on the ground default is
moving to this more than in usually


515
0:32:56,12 --> 0:32:59,2
doesn't


516
0:32:59,2 --> 0:33:3,63
which tells the opposite side of the
century since the last week the surface


517
0:33:3,63 --> 0:33:6,12
should have shifted three hundred inches


518
0:33:6,12 --> 0:33:10,8
twenty five feet some more


519
0:33:10,8 --> 0:33:11,74
but few can since


520
0:33:11,74 --> 0:33:17,95
so sooner or later something's gotta
give free alcoa knows what's that's


521
0:33:17,95 --> 0:33:20,95
something will be


522
0:33:20,95 --> 0:33:25,8
trucks concerts


523
0:33:25,8 --> 0:33:29,42
and uh... one example


524
0:33:29,42 --> 0:33:33,529
this typo frock which is called the
granite and this is in fact the rock


525
0:33:33,529 --> 0:33:38,58
out-of which most of the earths crust is
made


526
0:33:38,58 --> 0:33:42,58
a microscope reveals the crystalline
structure of the granite


527
0:33:42,58 --> 0:33:45,15
the crystals make the rock stuff


528
0:33:45,15 --> 0:33:47,63
but they have a hidden weakness


529
0:33:47,63 --> 0:33:51,74
bonds between they suddenly crack under
stress


530
0:33:51,74 --> 0:33:54,41
basically wants those materials
solidifies


531
0:33:54,41 --> 0:33:56,9
uh... it is able to uh... arm


532
0:33:56,9 --> 0:33:59,58
crack and the sheared


533
0:33:59,58 --> 0:34:4,259
on the fourth surface and liberal
behavior of resources what wise behind


534
0:34:4,259 --> 0:34:7,12
the physics of prescription


535
0:34:7,12 --> 0:34:11,96
granite rocks underline all the san
andreas fall of right field the rocks


536
0:34:11,96 --> 0:34:16,74
under greater stress than anywhere else
because it's so many centuries since a


537
0:34:16,74 --> 0:34:19,729
major quake occurred


538
0:34:19,729 --> 0:34:23,429
and now we're already three hundred
years on it and so it is not


539
0:34:23,429 --> 0:34:27,169
uh... the strain them all the strain
that has being accumulate in the fault


540
0:34:27,169 --> 0:34:28,429
at this point


541
0:34:28,429 --> 0:34:32,699
as very close to the maximum strain of
this fall has ever seen through its


542
0:34:32,699 --> 0:34:36,939
uh... of geological record and this is a
full dennis couple of generating great


543
0:34:36,939 --> 0:34:40,669
destructive earthquake


544
0:34:40,669 --> 0:34:44,949
tiago believes becoming quake could be
the big that people have been talking


545
0:34:44,949 --> 0:34:47,259
about for years


546
0:34:47,259 --> 0:34:48,889
that's


547
0:34:48,889 --> 0:34:53,959
because of the population density in
southern california


548
0:34:53,959 --> 0:34:57,239
when the last huge quake occurred three
hundred years ago


549
0:34:57,239 --> 0:35:1,549
los angeles was just a tiny spanish
mission community you within one hundred


550
0:35:1,549 --> 0:35:5,509
people


551
0:35:5,509 --> 0:35:8,299
now it's america's second-largest city


552
0:35:8,299 --> 0:35:11,939
with almost eleven million people living
in the earthquake bomb rebel


553
0:35:11,939 --> 0:35:16,179
metropolitan area


554
0:35:16,179 --> 0:35:18,3
people in california


555
0:35:18,3 --> 0:35:21,99
probably experienced the smaller
moderate size earthquake every year


556
0:35:21,99 --> 0:35:26,29
giving the moving in your house but it's
really actually kind of fun there is no


557
0:35:26,29 --> 0:35:28,519
major destruction


558
0:35:28,519 --> 0:35:30,629
people just along with their life


559
0:35:30,629 --> 0:35:37,139
how much bigger events on the other hand
are quite a bit different story


560
0:35:37,139 --> 0:35:39,989
with the threat to los angeles becoming
ever clearer


561
0:35:39,989 --> 0:35:44,679
the investigations nearing its
conclusion


562
0:35:44,679 --> 0:35:49,219
repeated g_p_s_ measurements in the
desert reveal evidence that stress is


563
0:35:49,219 --> 0:35:50,91
building up


564
0:35:50,91 --> 0:36:2,789
while examination of the rocks of the
crust show they may not take the strain


565
0:36:2,789 --> 0:36:7,49
all the evidence points towards a
potentially huge earthquake


566
0:36:7,49 --> 0:36:8,819
building up


567
0:36:8,819 --> 0:36:12,529
southern california


568
0:36:12,529 --> 0:36:15,569
and new experiments suggest the coming
plague


569
0:36:15,569 --> 0:36:18,549
could be far worse


570
0:36:18,549 --> 0:36:29,579
ever imagined


571
0:36:29,579 --> 0:36:33,469
there is new urgency in the
investigation into the san andreas falls


572
0:36:33,469 --> 0:36:37,509
as revealed by recent evidence compiled
by three hundred america's most


573
0:36:37,509 --> 0:36:41,419
respected scientists


574
0:36:41,419 --> 0:36:45,579
they warned that los angeles will be
devastated for major quake strikes along


575
0:36:45,579 --> 0:36:50,409
the southern section of the fall


576
0:36:50,409 --> 0:36:54,729
while there hasn't been a major quake
for hundreds of years even small ones


577
0:36:54,729 --> 0:36:56,959
can still be deadly


578
0:36:56,959 --> 0:37:0,809
but the northridge earthquake which
struck this l_a_ suburb in nineteen


579
0:37:0,809 --> 0:37:6,579
ninety four


580
0:37:6,579 --> 0:37:10,119
luxury along an offshoot of the main san
andreas fall


581
0:37:10,119 --> 0:37:13,329
the quake was only a magnitude six point
seven


582
0:37:13,329 --> 0:37:19,369
considered moderate on the scale of
earthquake measured


583
0:37:19,369 --> 0:37:26,319
but it's still killed seventy two people
and injured twelve thousand


584
0:37:26,319 --> 0:37:31,49
and new evidence suggests mother nature
might have a lot more in store for los


585
0:37:31,49 --> 0:37:41,279
angeles


586
0:37:41,279 --> 0:37:45,359
scientists have long known that
earthquakes generate several distinct


587
0:37:45,359 --> 0:37:48,47
sets of ways


588
0:37:48,47 --> 0:37:52,569
the travel at different speeds each
spreading damage and destruction out


589
0:37:52,569 --> 0:37:56,44
from the epicenter


590
0:37:56,44 --> 0:38:1,38
modern city buildings in birthweight
prone areas like california engineer


591
0:38:1,38 --> 0:38:4,419
companies such way


592
0:38:4,419 --> 0:38:9,199
now do research by geophysicist
professor our results suggests that the


593
0:38:9,199 --> 0:38:16,249
senator is may offer a new and even more
deadly threat


594
0:38:16,249 --> 0:38:20,699
resigned his research is how birthrates
rupture along straight lines faults


595
0:38:20,699 --> 0:38:26,359
just like the san andreas where it
approaches los angeles


596
0:38:26,359 --> 0:38:30,899
he creates his own many earthquakes
representing the san andreas fault by


597
0:38:30,899 --> 0:38:37,219
hairline crack in the thick transparent
block


598
0:38:37,219 --> 0:38:44,549
this special material shows up internal
stress lines when it's a bit violation


599
0:38:44,549 --> 0:38:45,699
and the earthquake


600
0:38:45,699 --> 0:38:49,439
is triggered by a tiny explosion


601
0:38:49,439 --> 0:38:53,849
st


602
0:38:53,849 --> 0:38:56,749
and dot


603
0:38:56,749 --> 0:39:0,39
and it's not always began after we have
a threat


604
0:39:0,39 --> 0:39:4,58
people from high speed camera capturing
ten million frames a second


605
0:39:4,58 --> 0:39:10,249
reveals a startling in newly discovered
phenomenon


606
0:39:10,249 --> 0:39:11,54
this frozen picture


607
0:39:11,54 --> 0:39:16,0
reveal stress line speeding along the
many san andreas in the milliseconds


608
0:39:16,0 --> 0:39:20,729
after the explosion


609
0:39:20,729 --> 0:39:25,39
patrol into the left of this train is a
previously unrecognized type of


610
0:39:25,39 --> 0:39:30,179
shockwave racing along the rupture line
from the earthquake center


611
0:39:30,179 --> 0:39:34,609
on a microscopic scale it looks and
moves exactly like the sonic boom


612
0:39:34,609 --> 0:39:38,329
produced when the supersonic aircraft
such as coddling


613
0:39:38,329 --> 0:39:40,139
breaks the sound barrier


614
0:39:40,139 --> 0:39:42,579
because we also see microloans


615
0:39:42,579 --> 0:39:45,209
lines that i needed to fund up to fix


616
0:39:45,209 --> 0:39:48,179
are from the kids


617
0:39:48,179 --> 0:39:49,669
airplanes


618
0:39:49,669 --> 0:39:51,649
and just like a sonic boom


619
0:39:51,649 --> 0:39:54,69
you can be dangerous


620
0:39:54,69 --> 0:39:57,309
the same sense that we hear this morning


621
0:39:57,309 --> 0:39:58,59
uh... from the cargo


622
0:39:58,59 --> 0:40:0,999
you're going to see this funny


623
0:40:0,999 --> 0:40:2,139
from that


624
0:40:2,139 --> 0:40:6,739
the danger comes because many high-rises
just aren't built to cope with extra


625
0:40:6,739 --> 0:40:9,69
stress from this newly discovered tight


626
0:40:9,69 --> 0:40:10,869
shop


627
0:40:10,869 --> 0:40:13,989
so if you are in all of the indian for
example


628
0:40:13,989 --> 0:40:15,92
abuses wondering


629
0:40:15,92 --> 0:40:19,839
you would like to relate some damage


630
0:40:19,839 --> 0:40:22,669
very soon after that


631
0:40:22,669 --> 0:40:29,619
based on ground shaking callers ago on
it actually is coming


632
0:40:29,619 --> 0:40:32,94
the high-speed wrote to the resigned his
call synergy


633
0:40:32,94 --> 0:40:39,449
happen where forbes running in a
straight line


634
0:40:39,449 --> 0:40:43,269
which might help explain the one hundred
year old miserable surrounding the great


635
0:40:43,269 --> 0:40:45,149
san francisco void


636
0:40:45,149 --> 0:40:54,359
natural disaster which launched the
entire san andreas investigation


637
0:40:54,359 --> 0:40:55,77
the overwhelming tan


638
0:40:55,77 --> 0:40:59,51
san francisco has long seemed
surprisingly out of proportion


639
0:40:59,51 --> 0:41:4,299
to the seven point eight magnitude


640
0:41:4,299 --> 0:41:6,81
and there's a particularly straight
section


641
0:41:6,81 --> 0:41:11,529
the san andreas approaching san
francisco


642
0:41:11,529 --> 0:41:16,559
so many scientists now believe but the
damage was greater than expected because


643
0:41:16,559 --> 0:41:23,529
nineteen oh six quake had traveled as
super sheer speed


644
0:41:23,529 --> 0:41:27,859
of greater concern to modern emergency
services is not what happened a century


645
0:41:27,859 --> 0:41:29,73
ago but what could happen


646
0:41:29,73 --> 0:41:35,95
tomorrow because there is a similar
street section of false aggressed


647
0:41:35,95 --> 0:41:39,619
heading straight towards los angeles


648
0:41:39,619 --> 0:41:43,699
and here's the super show your first
with develops on that line and than the


649
0:41:43,699 --> 0:41:48,499
consequences could be disastrous


650
0:41:48,499 --> 0:41:52,289
all of the investigations warnings about
the senate race came together in the


651
0:41:52,289 --> 0:41:53,96
fall of two thousand eight


652
0:41:53,96 --> 0:41:58,319
with the biggest earthquake drills ever
held in california's if this rather


653
0:41:58,319 --> 0:42:1,89
quick would have happened in reality


654
0:42:1,89 --> 0:42:4,39
it would have been buildings coming down
the you know that there would be no


655
0:42:4,39 --> 0:42:9,169
watertown certainly areas sets within
six says it's all about


656
0:42:9,169 --> 0:42:13,459
but but but the real chance of los
angeles soon being hit by a massive


657
0:42:13,459 --> 0:42:16,609
birthplace


658
0:42:16,609 --> 0:42:20,289
the best scientific consensus now warns
that there's a ninety nine-percent


659
0:42:20,289 --> 0:42:21,54
chance


660
0:42:21,54 --> 0:42:27,379
of a major earthquake in southern
california within the next thirty years


661
0:42:27,379 --> 0:42:31,539
to better understand the threat to l_a_
the geologists produced their study


662
0:42:31,539 --> 0:42:36,329
joint experts in charge of the city's
disaster plan


663
0:42:36,329 --> 0:42:40,689
and none of them doubt that the big
quake is coming


664
0:42:40,689 --> 0:42:46,779
there really isn't even a question of s
anymore


665
0:42:46,779 --> 0:42:54,18
the shaking is going to be a severe for
two to three minutes


666
0:42:54,18 --> 0:42:57,79
and is gonna stop


667
0:42:57,79 --> 0:43:1,289
many had that moment of silence about
that happens before you start hearing


668
0:43:1,289 --> 0:43:3,139
car alarms


669
0:43:3,139 --> 0:43:5,889
although the selling out of the


670
0:43:5,889 --> 0:43:10,9
the study estimates that in a juror's
within the l_a_ metro area


671
0:43:10,9 --> 0:43:14,29
would cost two thousand deaths fifty
thousand injured


672
0:43:14,29 --> 0:43:18,639
and two hundred billion dollars of debt


673
0:43:18,639 --> 0:43:23,929
figure out how corporations developing
and the blocks will be on fire


674
0:43:23,929 --> 0:43:26,769
and


675
0:43:26,769 --> 0:43:34,459
that's the kind that there's an era that
we're looking at the


676
0:43:34,459 --> 0:43:39,259
this factor of disaster california's
people in cities motivates the search to


677
0:43:39,259 --> 0:43:42,839
unravel the secrets of the san andreas
full


678
0:43:42,839 --> 0:43:43,759
all the evidence


679
0:43:43,759 --> 0:43:46,2
finally did


680
0:43:46,2 --> 0:43:47,259
jennifer


681
0:43:47,259 --> 0:43:53,13
nineteen oh six disaster chokeholds
eight hundred miles


682
0:43:53,13 --> 0:43:57,19
different types of rock at muscle rock
provide clues to how the fault was


683
0:43:57,19 --> 0:44:1,99
created twenty million years ago


684
0:44:1,99 --> 0:44:6,239
the riverbed


685
0:44:6,239 --> 0:44:9,469
middletown explains why some parts slim


686
0:44:9,469 --> 0:44:12,459
without major quakes


687
0:44:12,459 --> 0:44:17,979
fertile ground rocks reveal a threat to
los angeles


688
0:44:17,979 --> 0:44:21,939
recent lab experiments uncover new and
more danger


689
0:44:21,939 --> 0:44:26,999
earthquake shockwave


690
0:44:26,999 --> 0:44:28,159
one goal


691
0:44:28,159 --> 0:44:30,959
has eluded rock detective


692
0:44:30,959 --> 0:44:38,299
the greatest fault line on purpose


693
0:44:38,299 --> 0:44:40,31
with the sleeping san andreas


694
0:44:40,31 --> 0:44:44,229
come to life once again


695
0:44:44,229 --> 0:44:46,879
that could be anytime


696
0:44:46,879 --> 0:44:48,649
was the only certainty


697
0:44:48,649 --> 0:44:50,339
is that nothing is certain


698
0:44:50,339 --> 0:44:53,39
you need ever evolving story


699
0:44:53,39 --> 0:46:53,39
delivered
