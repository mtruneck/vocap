MUTSUO SAKAMOTO:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]


3
0:0:14,73 --> 0:0:21,201



4
0:0:21,201 --> 0:0:23,57
CHRIS GARVER: I don't think
Mutsuo would ever talk about


5
0:0:23,57 --> 0:0:25,2
himself that much.


6
0:0:25,2 --> 0:0:27,56
You'd meet him and you'd be like
oh, he's a really nice,


7
0:0:27,56 --> 0:0:30,56
quiet guy and he's not
like a hustler.


8
0:0:30,56 --> 0:0:35,67
He's just really dedicated to
tattooing as an artist.

MUTSUO SAKAMOTO:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]


10
0:0:37,61 --> 0:0:58,42



11
0:0:58,42 --> 0:1:0,17
CHRIS GARVER: I don't even
know if at the time he


12
0:1:0,17 --> 0:1:3,42
realized that he was
in the perfect spot


13
0:1:3,42 --> 0:1:5,63
at the right time.


14
0:1:5,63 --> 0:1:7,42
He learned how to tattoo
everything.


15
0:1:7,42 --> 0:1:8,44
He kind of got like an


16
0:1:8,44 --> 0:1:11,7
American '90s tattoo education.


17
0:1:11,7 --> 0:1:14,88
He's probably the first person
in Japan to get that.


18
0:1:14,88 --> 0:1:16,13
He's a groundbreaker.

0:1:16,13 --> 0:3:16,13
