###9 SECRETARY KERRY: Well, it's my pleasure to follow the comedian from New Zealand. (Laughter.)
###15 I'm happy to follow two guys who speak kind of funny. (Laughter.)
###21 What a pleasure to be here with Ambassador Mike Moore, former prime minister, who is
###26 a great person and a terrific leader. And I am so grateful to him for the leadership
###34 of New Zealand, a country I've had a chance to visit several times beginning way back
###40 when I was in the United States Navy; and also my friend Bob Carr, and thank you, Mr.
###47 Minister, for being here with us. I told him today I have not yet been lucky enough to
###51 get down under, but I am sure to get there very, very soon and I look forward to it.
###59 Really privileged to have these two gentlemen supporting this endeavor, and I'm particularly
###65 grateful to the Pew Charitable Trust and to National Geographic. Terry, thank you so much
###70 for making this available tonight. Everybody's favorite magazine; I think we all grew up
###78 with it and it just stays extraordinary. And tonight you'll share in a film which will
###86 really underscore the importance of everything that that magazine tries to impart to all
###92 of us and has stood for all of these years.
###99 I am a child of the ocean in many ways. From the first moment when I was a kid up at Cape
###107 Cod dipping my toes into Buzzards Bay looking for clams, literally a three or four year-old
###115 being shown the wonders of the ocean, shrimping and other things, to a time when we used to
###121 gather mussels in the evening and an hour later cook them and enjoy an incredible meal.
###129 Today, very difficult to find mussels anywhere in that area.
###135 So I've watched the transition. I've seen it. As a senator I was privileged to bring
###142 efforts before the United Nations with Ted Stevens to end driftnet fishing, and also
###150 to try to work hard to preserve through a number of fisheries bills - I think I rewrote
###156 the Magnuson Fisheries Act at least three or four times - as we tried to get the balance
###162 right and protect our fisheries.
###165 I've seen the struggle with respect to invasive species and I have seen this fragile ecosystem
###173 change before our very eyes, whether it's a problem of acidification, a problem of pollution
###180 and development, a problem of ice melt and potential ecosystem collapse, to the rise
###188 of the sea levels, which is happening in various parts of the world more so than elsewhere,
###194 to the overfishing that takes place in almost every single fishery on the face of the planet.
###201 We call this beautiful planet that we are privileged to inhabit for a short period of
###208 time, we call it Earth, but it could well have been called Ocean because three-quarters
###215 of it is ocean. And the oceans are responsible in many ways for life because of the cycle
###223 of rain and humidity and all of the protein and life that comes from the ocean. So we
###229 can't be casual about it. We can't be casual about it. And it is clear that we have an
###238 enormous challenge ahead of us as we face the extraordinary excess that we see with
###247 respect to each of those issues that I talked about: energy policy that results in acidification,
###252 the bleaching of coral, the destruction of species, the change in the Arctic because
###257 of the ice melt, and the change in the krill, the population of whales. The entire system
###263 is interdependent, and we toy with that at our peril.
###270 So it is vital that we've come to this moment where we begin to see that this is not just
###276 an environmental issue. This is a security issue. It's an economic security issue. It's
###283 a national security issue. And it is in many ways a challenge with respect to energy security
###293 and our approach to energy policy, and ultimately it is a challenge to our commitment to science
###302 and facts and ultimately our basic sense of faith and what we believe in and our responsibility
###311 as human beings on this planet.
###314 So climate change is coming back in a sense as a serious international issue because people
###324 are experiencing it firsthand. The science is screaming at us, literally, demanding that
###332 people in positions of public responsibility at least exercise the so-called "precautionary
###339 principle" to balance the equities and not knowing completely the outcomes at least understand
###346 what is happening and take steps to prevent potential disaster. I've often said to people,
###353 "What is the worst that could happen to you if you make a decision to put good energy
###359 policy in place and respond to what the science and the facts are telling us?" Well, the worst
###363 that can happen to you if you would employ a lot of people in alternative and renewable
###367 and clean energy; you would have less hospitalizations, cleaner air, more children with less asthma;
###375 and you would create an enormous number of jobs by moving to those new energy possibilities
###382 and policies and infrastructure. That's the worst that can happen to you.
###387 What if the other people are wrong and we are right; what's the worst that can happen?
###394 The destruction of the ecosystem as we live with it today. So that's really what's on
###401 the line, and I'm here to tell you that, proudly, President Obama has put this agenda back on
###408 the front burner where it belongs, that he has in his Inauguration Address and in his
###413 State of the Union Address and in the policies he's working on now said we are going to try
###419 to exercise leadership because of its imperatives.
###423 So I want to thank the Pew Foundation and National Geographic for joining in this imperative.
###430 We need to try to pass the Law of the Sea. We attempted to do that earlier and we will
###436 continue to try to press for that. But most important when it comes to the Ross Sea and
###442 Antarctica, we're not going to wait for a crisis before we take action. I think we're
###448 making a smart choice now. We're proud to join with New Zealand and Australia, two countries
###453 that have an extraordinary understanding of the sea and commitment to protecting it and
###458 who have been great stewards.
###460 The Ross Sea, as we heard from Karen earlier, is a natural laboratory. And we disrespect
###466 it at our peril, as we do the rest of the ocean. The environment there is so extreme,
###473 as we know, that it's difficult to live as a penguin or a killer whale or a seal, but
###479 they've adapted. And in their adaptation, we've learned what a remarkably diverse and
###485 productive ecosystem it is. We've learned from the scientists who go down there at McMurdo
###492 Station and spend those critical months trying to research it and understand it.
###496 Now, you've probably never asked a waiter - any of you - for a nice Antarctic tooth
###501 fish, I suspect. You're probably more used to ordering it as a Chilean sea bass. But
###508 American researchers working in the Ross Sea have actually discovered that the tooth fish
###513 produces a special antifreeze protein, and whenever ice crystals form in the fish's cells,
###522 these proteins latch onto them and actually ferry the ice out of the body. That discovery
###529 has launched a whole new scientific field of structural biology, and it's helping us
###535 to think now about other adaptations to extreme environment in new ways. It also has commercial
###542 applications. Think about perhaps fluffier bread or ice cream that stays frozen without
###548 ice crystals in it. These are real possibilities.
###553 Another group of researchers from my home state of Massachusetts have done remarkable
###557 work studying the physiology of seals as they dive in the Ross Sea. And they've actually
###564 learned - they've helped unlock our understanding of hypoxia, which is a condition that develops
###572 when the body is deprived of oxygen. As a result of that, they have actually developed
###577 a treatment that has dealt with hypoxic newborns and saved more than 10,000 babies a year.
###588 That's what we can learn, as well as many, many other things that we could talk about.
###592 So imagine the possibilities of these discoveries that await us if we can encourage our innovators
###601 and our inventors to put our shoulder to the wheel and have the maximum preservation of
###606 the opportunity of that laboratory.
###609 That's why it is so important for the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
###614 Resources to approve our proposals to establish this Marine Protected Area - and you've heard
###621 all the comparisons from Ambassador Mike Moore about roughly the size of this, that, several
###630 Californias, Alaska. It's extraordinary. It will be quite simply the largest protected
###637 area in the world.
###638 Now, I know the value of that, and the reason I know the value of that is I was the author
###644 in the Senate of the Marine Sanctuary called Stellwagen Bank off our cape. And we have
###650 seen what that preservation has been able to do. Imagine what this would do as a baseline
###655 study for what happens to the species that assemble in that area as we preserve a component
###663 of it as a managed fishery and the rest of it as a baseline laboratory for all of this
###670 research.
###671 We also support the important proposal of Australia, the EU, and France that they have
###676 developed for protection of East Antarctica.
###680 So my friends, I'd just summarize by saying this to you: Antarctica is a collection of
###688 superlatives. It is the highest, the coldest, the windiest, the driest, the most pristine,
###695 and the most remote place on Earth. And it has beguiled humankind for centuries as people
###703 have sought to understand it. Starting in the 1700s, explorers struggled to chart its
###710 contours and to cross its desolation without any guarantee ever of a safe return. And still
###717 today, curiosity and sheer doggedness are what draw people from all around the world
###723 to explore its southernmost shore.
###726 So we signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959. For those who doubt the benefit of treaties,
###735 go look at what we have achieved there, not to mention so many others. The world has shown
###741 that we can work together to ensure that Antarctica remains a place devoted to peace and devoted
###749 to expanding the human understanding of this fragile planet that we live on. This is one
###754 of the last places we could do this, and I think we owe it to ourselves to make it happen.
###760 So I thank you for coming here tonight. I noticed coming in here there were a number
###765 of empty wine glasses on the tables, so I know you didn't waste your time completely
###770 before I got here. (Laughter.) But I hope this movie will inspire you. I hope the support
###776 of our wonderful friends who understand the ocean as well as any people on this planet
###784 and who have worked to preserve it, I hope that will inspire all of you to connect to
###788 the rest of America and the rest of the world to apply our human responsibility during this
###795 time of stewardship that we have on this fragile planet.
###799 Thank you for being here tonight. Thank you most of all for what you're going to do. I'd
###802 just remind you, in the 1970s there wasn't really an environment movement in America.
###814 We didn't have an EPA. Just think of that. We had no EPA. And it wasn't until Rachel
###821 Carson wrote her Silent Spring and inspired people to become activists that people became
###827 aware of Love Canal and Woburn dump and places which give people cancer and kill citizens.
###836 And all of a sudden, people decided we don't want to live next to these places, we think
###840 there's a different choice. And 20 million people came out of their homes on one single
###845 day. April 21st, 1970 was the first Earth Day. And those 20 million people didn't stop
###853 on that day. They translated that day's action into political action. They targeted the 12
###860 worst votes in the United States Congress, labeled them the Dirty Dozen, and kicked seven
###866 of them out of Congress in the 1972 election. You know what happened? It unleashed a torrent
###874 of activity so that we passed the Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Marine Mammal
###879 Protection Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and even created
###884 the EPA, which Richard Nixon, whose idea it was not, signed it into law. (Laughter and
###892 applause.)
###893 So folks, that's what being here is all about. That's what tonight's inspiration is all about.
###900 We can change everybody's attitude about this because it matters to all of us. Thank you
###905 and God bless. (Applause.)
