###0 >> Good morning.
###1 Good morning, I'm Kathy White, member of the Board of Regents,
###5 University of Michigan.
###5 And it's my pleasure to welcome you here this morning.
###9 But I'm here to introduce Mary Sue Coleman,
###11 our 13th president here at the University of Michigan.
###14 And we are so proud that Time Magazine has named President
###20 Coleman one of the 10 best university presidents
###23 in United States.
###25 [ Applause ]
###34 And she's just finished her year as the chair of the Association
###41 of American Universities
###42 where she ably represented North America's leading
###46 research universities.
###49 And as our president, she has been very diligent
###52 about broadening the university's reach
###55 and impact whether in Detroit or in Brazil.
###60 And throughout her leadership, she's been a strong advocate
###63 of the contributions, creativity, and the innovation
###67 of Michigan student, staff, faculty, and alumni.
###71 And most importantly, for the Board of Regents we are
###73 so excited because Mary Sue Coleman has brought us
###76 so many wonderful research, resources from raising money,
###82 and that of course is needed very much to help our faculty,
###85 staff, and students do all the great work that they do.
###90 So please join me in welcoming the president of the University
###93 of Michigan, Dr. Mary Sue Coleman.
###95 [ Applause ]
###106 >> Well, good morning!
###107 [Multiple Speakers] And thanks to all of you
###110 for braving the weather out there to be here with us.
###114 And thanks to all those who are here virtually
###117 around the campus.
###119 Our thoughts are certainly with those on the East Coast
###122 who endured Hurricane Sandy last night
###125 and the aftermath this morning.
###128 We gathered in this space a year ago, and I believe we were lucky
###133 to squeeze onto the October calendar this year.
###137 When Steve Ross made his historic gift 8 years ago,
###141 we knew that it would elevate everything
###143 about the business school.
###145 But I don't think anyone would have predicted the demand
###148 for this view that you see out the windows.
###150 So thank you, Steve, and thank you to the Ross Business School
###154 for hosting us this morning.
###157 This is a special year, for me personally,
###160 and more significantly, in the life of the University.
###163 I've had the privilege now of leading the University
###166 for 10 years, and it's been a decade of challenges,
###170 transformation and tremendous momentum.
###173 I continue to be energized by the life-changing work
###176 of this institution, and by the contributions of leaders
###180 like you from all three campuses.
###183 When we talk of Michigan and impact, the one name rises
###188 above all others, Raoul Wallenberg.
###191 I hope you know his story.
###194 After earning his architecture degree here in 1935,
###198 he went on to become one
###200 of the most noted humanitarians of the last century.
###203 As a diplomat in Budapest,
###206 Raoul Wallenberg repeatedly risked his life
###209 to rescue thousands of Jews
###211 from World War II's concentration camps.
###215 He pulled them from moving boxcars.
###218 When Nazis forced them to walk to the camps, Wallenberg chased
###222 after them, shoving food and medicine their way.
###226 He found countless ways to shelter terrified men,
###229 women and children trying to survive
###232 in what was then the last surviving ghetto
###235 of Jews in Europe.
###237 He saved some 100,000, 100,000.
###243 And then he disappeared at the hands of strangers.
###248 We are still seeking answers about his fate.
###252 This year, 2012, is the centennial
###256 of Raoul Wallenberg's birth.
###258 I can't think of no more important occasion
###261 to dedicate our work as a university
###264 to the values he lived.
###266 He loved to learn, he had an appetite for adventure,
###270 and he embraced new people and different places.
###274 He was and is a hero of the highest order.
###279 He showed us, more than any Michigan graduate,
###283 that one person can make a difference.
###286 Could we, as students and scholars,
###288 ask for greater inspiration?
###293 The University of Michigan is indeed an inspiring place.
###299 And that's because of the ideas, discoveries and service
###302 of our students, staff and faculty.
###306 In the room today, we have students like Conor Lane,
###310 an honors senior who works as both an RA
###312 at the Residential College and a volunteer
###316 at the Spectrum Center.
###318 And Jasmine Injejikian,
###321 who is leading this year's Dance Marathon.
###325 That's hundreds of students dancing for 30 straight hours
###328 to raise thousands for children with disabilities.
###332 We're joined by staff like Dan Rife,
###335 an engineer who combines new technologies
###338 with human expertise to conserve energy throughout our
###342 campus buildings.
###344 And Lieutenant Colonel Lisa Franz,
###347 who leads our ROTC program, Air Force ROTC,
###351 one of the three officer training programs at Michigan.
###355 We have faculty like Carla O'Connor,
###358 an engaging Thurnau Professor, who is bringing her love
###361 of teaching and mentoring to the dean's office
###365 in the School of Education.
###367 And professors like Michael Boehnke,
###370 a world-class statistical geneticist
###372 from the School of Public Health.
###375 His breakthroughs help us better understand the heredity
###379 of diabetes, bipolar disorder and other debilitating diseases.
###385 I also want to recognize four deans who are in the final year
###390 of their leadership tenures.
###392 Terry McDonald in the College of Literature, Science
###396 and the Arts, Evan Caminker of the Law School, Peter Polverini
###402 of the Dental School, and Paul Courant
###405 of the University Libraries.
###408 These four have carried out extraordinary work in one
###412 of the University's most challenging fiscal eras.
###416 Their programs are collectively stronger
###419 because of their good work.
###422 I also want to acknowledge Fran Blouin, who is stepping
###426 down as the longest-serving director
###428 of the Bentley Historical Library.
###431 Fortunately for our students,
###433 he will be devoting himself full time to the classroom next fall.
###439 At Michigan, we know-- because it is borne out each day--
###445 that our diversity is the backbone
###447 of our academic strength.
###450 Diversity is a core value of this institution, in this room,
###456 across our campuses, and wherever the University
###460 of Michigan is in the world.
###463 In the course of my decade here, I have taken great pride
###467 in Michigan being the nation's leading voice for the value
###470 of diversity-- in the classroom, in the research lab,
###475 and in all parts of the academic enterprise.
###479 But it's not simply an outcome of the last decade.
###482 This is deeply embedded in our culture and sense of identity
###486 from the University's earliest days.
###489 The first black woman in America to train as a dentist did
###493 so here-- more than 100 years ago.
###497 As did the first African-American woman
###499 to earn a doctorate in physics.
###502 When an Ivy League school rejected Jose Barbosa in 1877
###506 because of his race, Michigan welcomed him.
###510 Our students said they did not care about his skin color.
###514 In their words, what truly mattered was "the quantity
###518 and quality of brains in the cranium."
###523 Brains in the cranium.
###525 Dr. Jose Celso Barbosa would go on to become the father
###530 of statehood for his native Puerto Rico.
###534 This legacy of inclusion and leadership brings
###537 with it a deep responsibility to live out our values.
###542 We work hard at creating and sustaining a community
###546 where diversity is sought and valued across all pathways--
###551 racial, ethnic, gender, LGBT, global and socioeconomic.
###557 We still have much work to do.
###560 That's why I am so pleased
###561 that LSA will launch a new theme semester
###564 in January, Understanding Race.
###566 It is an important example of just how critical it is for us
###571 to think substantively about race and identity
###575 and to encourage a thoughtful dialogue about these issues.
###579 I am a firm believer that knowledge is contingent.
###586 The work we do today, and the accomplishments we celebrate,
###589 would not be possible without the faculty,
###592 staff and students who came before us.
###595 When this year's Nobel Prize for medicine was announced,
###599 one of the winners was recognized
###600 for research he carried out 50 years ago.
###604 Fifty years.
###606 His discovery about tadpole cells has a direct impact
###610 on stem cell research conducted today,
###612 including in our laboratories.
###615 This is the beauty and power of scholarship.
###618 The commitments we make today will have an impact 20,
###622 30 and 50 years from now.
###626 That's why I'm excited to share with you some
###628 of our most significant achievements and challenges,
###632 as well as several announcements
###634 that will take Michigan in new directions.
###637 Let's begin with the arts.
###640 The Michigan environment for arts
###642 and creativity is remarkable.
###645 Remarkable because it is of a scope and scale you won't find
###649 at other national research universities.
###652 We make art, we research art, we present art and we preserve art.
###659 It can be in this weekend's performance of Urinetown
###662 by UM-Flint theater students.
###665 Or the Kelsey Museum's study of antiquities.
###669 It is the exhibit of priceless Armenian books at UM-Dearborn.
###673 Or Band-o-rama at Hill Auditorium itself a work of art
###678 and a campus icon for the past century.
###681 We do art and science very well.
###685 What binds the two is our capacity for creativity.
###690 And that is because of a culture that encourages creative work
###695 and creative approaches.
###697 It is an environment in which the University has invested 84
###701 million dollars since 2004.
###705 That includes a stunning addition to the Museum of Art,
###708 a Symphony Band tour of China, new programs
###712 for architecture students, and more studio and gallery space.
###716 This morning, I'm excited
###717 to say our creative environment is expanding once again.
###722 The School of Music, Theatre and Dance is a point of pride
###726 for Michigan, with talent that is second to no one.
###730 Now, these students, faculty and staff are going to enjoy new
###734 and improved surroundings to express their creativity,
###738 thanks to the vision of longtime Michigan donors William
###742 and Delores Brehm.
###744 The Brehms are generously providing 8 million dollars
###747 toward the renovation and expansion of the Moore Building,
###750 a transformative project we will ask the Board of Regents
###754 to approve next month.
###756 We anticipate new rehearsal rooms, studios
###759 and a lecture hall, as well as improved space
###762 for one-on-one time between faculty and students.
###766 With the regents' approval,
###767 this will be a 23 million dollar undertaking.
###771 The University will provide 14 million,
###773 and we will seek additional support from alumni and friends.
###779 I know that the faculty from Music, Theatre
###782 and Dance will agree when I say this project is overdue.
###787 It's genuinely exciting, and complements new spaces
###791 such as the Walgreen Drama Center
###793 and the Arthur Miller Theater.
###797 For more evidence of Michigan's capacity for creativity,
###800 we have the new Penny W. Stamps School of Art and Design.
###804 As you may know, Penny is a Michigan graduate
###808 who with her husband, Roe,
###810 has made a historic 32 million dollar investment
###814 in the School of Art and Design.
###817 Their generosity is wide-ranging--
###819 supporting student scholarships, as well as global experiences,
###824 visiting artists and designers, and community programs.
###828 Art and design schools are sometimes overlooked,
###831 but not here.
###832 Penny was on campus a few weeks ago,
###835 and was so enthusiastic about this gift.
###837 It is a magnificent feeling, she said,
###841 not only because she loves supporting the creative process,
###845 but because the Stamps School is "not just an art school."
###849 It's part of a major research institution.
###853 That is what gives the School of Music, Theatre and Dance,
###857 the Stamps School and all of our schools
###859 and colleges their strength, the combined expertise
###863 and creativity of so many disciplines.
###868 Indeed, the pursuit of arts
###869 at Michigan is not a stand-alone enterprise.
###872 It's not about decoration, it's about creation--
###876 creation that is deeply rooted
###878 in our interdisciplinary setting.
###881 It is this distinction that sets us apart.
###885 When the Stamps School underwent reaccreditation a few years ago,
###889 it drew high praise from the visiting team.
###893 Michigan, they said, is getting it right.
###897 To quote, "The School of Art and Design and the University
###901 of Michigan have created an opportunity
###904 to lead the academic conversation in art
###908 and design in this country."
###909 We want to drive the conversation
###913 in other areas, too.
###916 This month, the University is surveying members
###919 of our community about sustainability.
###922 We want to learn how people think and behave
###925 when it comes to the environment.
###928 By scientifically measuring and reporting our behavior
###931 as a community, we can work to make changes
###934 for the better of the planet.
###937 We know of no other university
###939 that is studying itself in this way.
###943 This survey will take place every year
###946 and will provide an objective barometer
###948 of our sustainability culture.
###951 I announced this survey a year ago as part
###954 of a broader sustainability initiative for the University.
###958 Since then, we have launched the Dow Scholars initiative,
###963 an unprecedented program for 300 graduate students
###966 that accelerates how we teach and research sustainability.
###972 This focus has evolved and strengthened in recent years,
###975 with early support from donors such as Dow,
###978 Don Graham and John Erb.
###981 They have shown what it means to commit to sustainability
###985 at the very core of personal and institutional values.
###990 John Erb, who is with us this morning, recently asked
###994 where I want to see the University of Michigan
###997 in the realm of sustainability 10, 20, 30 years from now.
###1002 I have been thinking a lot about that
###1005 as we set aspirational goals for Michigan's leadership.
###1009 I know, we all know, that we'll need to do a better job
###1014 of building facilities, affecting human behavior
###1017 and consumption, and challenging our energy usage,
###1022 even as we manage the world's largest public university
###1025 research portfolio.
###1028 But also, we must see the University as a global leader
###1032 in educating a new vanguard of sustainability experts.
###1037 It is here, on this campus,
###1040 where tomorrow's sustainability leaders will build their
###1043 knowledge broadly, across the disciplines,
###1046 and carry that into the world of policy and practice.
###1051 We should be known as the university
###1053 with sustainability research, curriculum and opportunities
###1058 that make a real difference.
###1061 In that spirit, today I'm pleased
###1063 to announce the establishment of the University
###1066 of Michigan Water Center.
###1069 With the support of the Erb Family Foundation,
###1073 this is a new 9 million dollar commitment
###1076 to the Great Lakes region.
###1078 We will focus on four critical areas:
###1082 reducing toxic contamination, fighting invasive species,
###1087 protecting wildlife habitat,
###1091 and promoting the health of the coastlines.
###1094 The University of Michigan has a long history
###1098 of freshwater research.
###1100 More than a century ago, our scientists were working
###1104 to determine why the whitefish population was
###1106 down in Lake Saint Clair.
###1109 Today, the Great Lakes are a source of food, recreation
###1113 and jobs-- some 1 and a half million jobs
###1117 that carry 62 billion dollar in yearly wages.
###1120 If you were to look for a country with a higher GDP
###1125 than the Great Lakes region, there are only two:
###1128 the United States and China.
###1133 As a university, we need to take on ownership and responsibility
###1136 of regional sustainability challenges that affect us--
###1140 close to home and where our expertise can have
###1144 enormous impact.
###1146 The Water Center will do that.
###1148 I want to thank John Erb and his family foundation
###1152 for supporting our work and for continually pushing us
###1156 to do more.
###1158 The Great Lakes hold one-fifth
###1161 of the world's freshwater supply.
###1165 One-fifth.
###1167 Compromise their health and integrity,
###1170 and the damage will be felt far beyond our shores.
###1174 Which is why it's so critical
###1176 to pursue not only local partnerships,
###1180 but international ones--
###1182 relationships that pull together different perspectives
###1185 to tackle the world's toughest challenges.
###1189 [ Pause ]
###1196 Doing more-- more research, more service, more collaboration--
###1201 means being more global.
###1204 Eighty years ago, when Raoul Wallenberg was a Michigan
###1208 student, he absolutely relished new people
###1212 and different cultures.
###1214 As an international student from Sweden, he visited Detroit,
###1218 New York, Chicago and New Orleans.
###1222 He and a classmate drove to Mexico one summer.
###1226 Another summer he hitchhiked to California,
###1229 and on up into Canada, and then thumbed his way back
###1233 to Ann Arbor.
###1235 He called his travels "training in diplomacy and tact."
###1239 Now, the parent in me does not condone hitchhiking.
###1242 But as university president,
###1245 I strongly endorse more global opportunities
###1248 for our students and faculty.
###1251 Just yesterday we learned
###1253 that Michigan students lead the nation
###1256 in this year's Fulbright grants.
###1258 I should say, once again we lead the nation.
###1261 For the sixth time in the past eight years.
###1265 Fulbrights support global study
###1267 and are among the world's most competitive
###1270 and prestigious programs.
###1272 I'm thinking they're becoming somewhat routine here though.
###1276 But, of course, no international experience is ordinary.
###1281 Consider Brazil.
###1283 My recent trip there
###1284 with a faculty delegation provides fertile territory
###1288 for our work as a university.
###1291 The country has seen enormous economic progress
###1294 in the past 20 years and its vibrancy is palpable.
###1299 Both federal and state governments are investing
###1302 heavily in education and in advancing science
###1305 and technology, and are developing ways
###1308 to move the previously disadvantaged
###1311 into the middle class.
###1313 I anticipate exciting collaborations resulting
###1316 from our conversations throughout Brazil.
###1319 And several members of the delegation are with us today,
###1321 and I want them to raise their hands so that you can see
###1324 who went with me to Brazil.
###1326 Got a couple up here, Gary and Don, raise your hands.
###1330 I want everyone to know how expertly the University was
###1335 represented on this trip.
###1336 Our discussions fell into three categories: medicine and health,
###1342 humanities and social sciences, environment
###1345 and natural resources.
###1347 At the University of Sao Paulo, for example,
###1350 there was intense interest in how we
###1353 as a university are addressing sustainability.
###1357 The Brazilian government is making impressive investments
###1360 in education with a bold new scholarship program called
###1364 Science Without Borders.
###1366 The goal is to educate 100,000 students by sending them abroad
###1371 for a year of study,
###1372 specifically in STEM disciplines.
###1375 That's science, technology, engineering and math.
###1379 Brazil wants to achieve this goal by 2015.
###1383 At the moment, there are 1,000 students in the program,
###1387 so you can see the challenges.
###1389 But it is one that leaders are willing to pursue.
###1393 Brazil wants half of these students-- 50,000--
###1396 to attend college here, in the United States, and our embassy
###1400 in Brasilia is trying to help with this very complex goal.
###1405 We were able to meet with the US ambassador and,
###1408 since we now better understand the issues, I'm confident
###1412 that we can respond in positive ways.
###1415 We currently have five undergraduate students enrolled
###1419 with us in the Science Without Borders program.
###1422 They are with us, and I'd like ask them to stand,
###1425 our Science Without Border students.
###1429 Those who are here, thank you so much for being here.
###1432 I look forward to welcoming more students in the future.
###1437 These students strengthen Michigan.
###1439 [ Applause ]
###1447 These students strengthen Michigan with their ideas
###1450 and perspectives, their experiences.
###1453 They demonstrate why we must, absolutely must, pursue true,
###1459 bilateral partnerships--
###1461 to succeed and thrive as a great institution.
###1465 As one university, we don't have all the answers.
###1470 But working together with many, our potential takes
###1473 on a totally new magnitude.
###1477 Which is why we're partnering with universities in China,
###1480 Ghana and South Africa, and why I'll lead a delegation
###1484 to India next year.
###1486 It's why we, as an institution, are communicating in Spanish,
###1490 Portuguese and Mandarin.
###1493 We've joined Weibo, China's version of Twitter,
###1496 and are now considered the most influential American university
###1500 in that space.
###1502 Global impact is why we chose to be the first public university
###1507 in Coursera, a massive online learning community.
###1511 And the key word here is massive.
###1514 More than 1.3 million people worldwide are enrolled
###1519 in courses.
###1520 Michigan faculty are teaching six classes,
###1524 with a seventh planned for January.
###1526 Professor Gautam Kaul's introductory finance course
###1530 alone attracted a staggering 133,000 students.
###1537 These courses are free, and they give us a way to connect
###1540 with students, whether in Michigan or Macedonia.
###1544 Coursera fits neatly with our public mission
###1547 of sharing knowledge.
###1548 We are also optimistic that it will help transform our
###1552 classroom pedagogy on campus as well.
###1558 Optimism is an equally critical ingredient for new discoveries
###1564 and technologies that spring
###1565 from our laboratories, clinics and studies.
###1569 Research universities fervently believe in improving the world,
###1573 and we do so in diverse ways.
###1576 Two months ago, the world lost a pioneer
###1579 with the passing of Neil Armstrong.
###1582 His walk on the moon was truly one
###1585 of the monumental achievements in science innovation--
###1588 not only in this country, but anywhere.
###1591 Think of the research, the creativity and the hard work
###1594 that went into Apollo 11.
###1597 NASA, industry, universities and others came together
###1601 with their research and their inventions.
###1604 It was the ultimate embodiment
###1605 of American innovation and collaboration.
###1609 Now also think of this, the computers
###1612 on Apollo 11 had less processing power than your smartphone.
###1617 This is why we continually innovate, invent and educate.
###1622 To discover new knowledge.
###1624 To move forward as a nation and a global community.
###1629 Michigan's research portfolio stands
###1632 at 1.27 billion dollars-- billion.
###1636 That exceeds the entire budget of Monaco.
###1640 No public university in the world invests more in research.
###1646 It's research that is more relevant than ever.
###1649 We are now the first university
###1651 to lead an entire satellite launch program,
###1655 a 52 million dollar venture entrusted to us by NASA.
###1659 This project is designed to better understand hurricanes,
###1663 which results in more accurate storm predictions and,
###1666 ultimately, lives saved.
###1668 Hurricane Sandy is showing us the importance of forecasting,
###1673 and it's gratifying to know
###1674 that our scientists will contribute even
###1676 more refinements.
###1679 We also see lives being saved with a new research project
###1682 that has thousands of vehicles throughout Ann Arbor using
###1686 technology to communicate with each other.
###1688 With the support of 22 million dollars from the Department
###1692 of Transportation, this technology is alerting drivers
###1696 to trouble on the road.
###1698 It may well lead to an 80 percent reduction in crashes.
###1703 That's impact.
###1705 Our health system, including University Hospital
###1708 and Mott Children's Hospital continues to be among the best
###1711 and safest in the country.
###1713 We have been selected as the home
###1716 for a new 21 million dollar federally funded center
###1719 for HIV research.
###1722 The University's two largest grants
###1724 from the National Institutes
###1725 of Health support the Comprehensive Cancer Center
###1728 and the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research.
###1732 Both were renewed this year,
###1735 with glowing comments from the NIH.
###1738 The North Campus Research Complex is attracting more
###1742 people and programs.
###1744 This includes the new Institute for Healthcare Policy
###1747 and Innovation and more than 400 researchers committed
###1751 to promoting high-quality, equitable
###1754 and affordable health care services.
###1757 We believe the Institute will be the largest
###1760 in the country for such work.
###1762 Today, we are announcing the first director,
###1766 Dr. John Ayanian, a highly respected researcher we've
###1770 attracted from the Michigan of the East, Harvard.
###1772 So, John, would you stand a minute just
###1774 for people to welcome you.
###1776 [ Applause ]
###1781 His expertise will give IHPI national prominence
###1787 and help us recruit even more top experts.
###1791 Dr. Ayanian is on campus this week and I'm thrilled
###1794 that he's here with us.
###1795 I mean just introduced him, so.
###1797 John needs to be at the Michigan Union shortly
###1799 to welcome a summit of national health care leaders,
###1803 and I really appreciate he's spending time
###1805 with us this morning.
###1807 The Michigan passion for entrepreneurship is flourishing.
###1812 Our scientists are declaring a record number of inventions more
###1815 than one a day this past year.
###1818 The Venture Accelerator, based at the NCRC, is officially full
###1823 with 18 startup companies built on U-M research discoveries.
###1828 We thought that the Accelerator would take three years to fill,
###1831 and it took less than half that time.
###1834 Students are enrolled in our first class of candidates
###1838 for the master's degree on entrepreneurship.
###1840 Here at the Ross School,
###1842 the Zell-Lurie Institute is ranked second
###1844 in the country among top graduate programs
###1847 for entrepreneurship.
###1849 The ZEAL clinic is up and running, connecting law students
###1852 with student entrepreneurs in need of legal counsel.
###1856 Faculty are beating down the doors to participate in MCubed,
###1860 our new funding program
###1862 that connects researchers across campus.
###1865 We are committing 15 million dollars
###1868 to some 250 team projects that are admittedly high-risk,
###1873 but also, potentially, very rewarding.
###1876 MCubed has grown out of our Third Century Initiative,
###1880 a 50 million dollar investment in teaching and research
###1883 that we announced a year ago.
###1886 This is a commitment taking us
###1887 up to the University's bicentennial,
###1890 and a third century of creative thinking.
###1894 We want to know, what are the different ways the University
###1898 can address the world's greatest challenges and opportunities?
###1902 What types of immersive learning experiences can we create
###1906 for our students?
###1908 We are eager to fund innovative answers.
###1911 And beginning next month,
###1912 the Provost's Office will be asking you,
###1915 the members of our community, for your best ideas.
###1919 When we talk about innovation and creativity,
###1924 we know that Michigan staff are essential to this culture.
###1929 We see it in Planet Blue,
###1931 with Voices of the Staff, and with MHealthy.
###1935 Today, I'm pleased to announce
###1937 that we will recognize the creative staff contributions
###1940 with a new Presidential Innovation Award.
###1943 With both words and dollars, we will honor individuals and teams
###1948 for ideas that make Michigan a better place to work and live.
###1952 The Chronicle of Higher Education consistently ranks
###1956 and recognizes this campus as one
###1958 of the best university workplaces.
###1961 It happened again this summer
###1962 and Michigan staff helped create that climate.
###1967 That Michigan is an invigorating place to live,
###1970 learn and work has been known by generations.
###1975 When Raoul Wallenberg was winding
###1978 down his time here, he wanted to stay.
###1982 "I feel so at home in my little Ann Arbor that I'm beginning
###1987 to sink down roots here,
###1989 and I have a hard time imagining leaving it."
###1994 But, he observed, "I'm not doing anything very useful here."
###1999 Isn't that what we want from our students?
###2002 To have an amazing experience here,
###2005 but know that their real value is
###2008 when they apply their lessons and move on?
###2013 Could Raoul Wallenberg have envisioned the horror of war
###2016 and the heroics he would display in World War II?
###2019 Of course not.
###2022 But he knew the importance of taking Michigan with him,
###2026 because the lessons would help shape the future.
###2030 Just how deeply is evidenced with us this morning.
###2035 Irene Butter and Andrew Nagy are emeritus faculty,
###2039 and I want them to stand for a minute.
###2043 [ Applause ]
###2051 Professors Butter and Nagy devoted more than 85 years
###2055 of combined teaching, research and service.
###2059 Dr. Butter was a professor in the School of Public Health
###2062 and helped write our state's Public Health Code.
###2065 Dr. Nagy is a space scientist with the College of Engineering
###2070 who was involved in numerous NASA projects.
###2073 But long before they were scholars,
###2076 they were scared Jewish teenagers living
###2079 through the Holocaust, she in Holland and he in Hungary.
###2084 Each survived, though members of their families did not.
###2088 Professor Nagy was saved by Raoul Wallenberg.
###2093 As Holocaust survivors and members of our community,
###2097 these two scholars have dedicated themselves
###2101 to the humanitarian spirit with their longtime service
###2105 to the University and the Wallenberg Lecture and Medal.
###2109 The Wallenberg Medal honors compassionate, global work,
###2115 and past recipients have included Elie Wiesel, John Lewis
###2120 and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
###2124 Just last week, one of our past honorees, Dr. Denis Mukwege,
###2129 was the target of assassins because of his tireless mission
###2135 to save rape victims in the Congo.
###2138 The words on the Wallenberg Medal are direct,
###2141 one person can make a difference.
###2144 Professors Butter and Nagy, you have done just
###2148 that with your scholarship and your dedication
###2151 to the Wallenberg legacy.
###2152 Thank you.
###2153 [ Applause ]
###2170 Today, in the 100th year of his birth, we will do more
###2174 to promote the spirit of Raoul Wallenberg.
###2177 I'm thrilled to announce the establishment
###2180 of the Raoul Wallenberg Fellowship for undergraduates.
###2185 This is a new 25,000 dollar stipend to be awarded
###2189 to a graduating senior
###2191 who demonstrates deep commitment to selfless work.
###2195 We want to help a new graduate dedicate the first year of his
###2199 or her life path to this calling.
###2203 It will now be among the University's largest prizes
###2206 for undergraduates.
###2208 Its name carries great importance
###2210 and even greater expectations.
###2213 And we will begin with a graduating senior
###2216 from the class of 2013.
###2219 Surely Raoul Wallenberg did not graduate intending
###2223 to become an international symbol of moral courage.
###2227 But his remarkable deeds provide inspiration
###2231 for today's Michigan students, and this new award will serve
###2235 to encourage careers dedicated to human rights.
###2241 Let me close with one last Wallenberg snapshot.
###2245 He's just completed his final exams and his freshman year.
###2250 In a letter home, he tells of staying up all night,
###2254 studying chemistry with friends.
###2257 It's not his best subject and he knows it.
###2260 He is thoroughly exhausted.
###2262 And still, he says, it's been worth it.
###2265 He's made friends.
###2266 He enjoys college.
###2268 Not so much of good grade, because of good grades,
###2271 but rather, "Because I feel like that I have learned something."
###2276 This is our mission as a great university.
###2279 That our students learn and grow, evolve as leaders,
###2283 and come to see themselves in a different light.
###2286 That our faculty and staff teach and grow as well,
###2290 changing people and places
###2293 with their discoveries and contributions.
###2295 That we all believe we can and will make a difference,
###2300 as individuals, as an academic community,
###2304 dedicated to transforming our state, our nation,
###2307 our world with ideas and actions.
###2311 Thank you.

###2343 So now we just have a few minutes and I'll be happy
###2346 to answer any questions that you might have, anything you might
###2350 like to, to know about.
###2356 Anyone? Hi Jim.
###2362 >> Now we were talking briefly at our table
###2376 about the ballot proposals that are facing Michigan voters
###2381 and wondering if you have any reflections
###2384 on ballot questions here in Michigan
###2386 and their potential impact upon the institution.
###2393 >> Okay. Well, thanks for the opportunity to give me another--
###2397 to give me an opportunity for another encouragement
###2402 for people to go and vote.
###2405 I sent out a message campus wide just this morning encouraging
###2411 you to make sure that you're registered and make sure
###2414 that you vote either in person or by absentee ballot.
###2417 This is-- there are a lot of issues on the ballot this time,
###2419 some state initiatives as well as local initiatives.
###2421 And I encourage you to educate yourselves.
###2422 There are several websites that are listed in my e-mail to go
###2424 and find out what these ballot proposals are all about.
###2425 Several of them will change the constitution of the state
###2427 and that's a serious issue and I just encourage you to find
###2428 out everything that you can and please go and vote,
###2430 it's very important responsibility as a citizen.
###2431 Well, thank you all very much and I also want to say how--
###2432 what a great privilege it was to grab the speech
###2434 around the centennial of Raoul Wallenberg's birth.
###2435 It's tremendous.
###2435 Thank you.
