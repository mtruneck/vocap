1
0:0:1,81 --> 0:0:10,73
There's not enough feeling or emotion in what
Jacque says. That's true, there isn't. But


2
0:0:10,73 --> 0:0:17,8
if you're emotionally attached to something,
it means you're subjective. There are people


3
0:0:17,8 --> 0:0:23,759
that nail pieces of wood together, then they
kiss it, before that, they don't kiss it.


4
0:0:23,759 --> 0:0:29,789
Till you nail it so it looks like a cross,
then you kiss it. You know what I mean? So,


5
0:0:29,789 --> 0:0:35,59
what was the day before it was a cross? 2
pieces of wood, or some copper that wasn't


6
0:0:35,59 --> 0:0:44,73
cast in a form of a cross. And a cross is
a crucifix which was long before people wore


7
0:0:44,73 --> 0:0:52,8
it, it was to crucify people, so it was a
symbolic, depending on what culture you come


8
0:0:52,8 --> 0:1:0,34
from. That's why I can't accept anything except
the sciences - the shape of an airplane wing


9
0:1:0,34 --> 0:1:8,829
is designed for a certain lift. The shape
of the plane is designed for certain conditions.


10
0:1:8,829 --> 0:1:16,27
So, you can't - when I say you can't exceed
your environment, that means you can't exceed


11
0:1:16,27 --> 0:1:22,46
what you've been exposed to. You can't, if
somebody gave you a brand new microscope,


12
0:1:22,46 --> 0:1:30,189
and you said the objective lenses are insufficient.
If you're a cannibal, you know what I mean?


13
0:1:30,189 --> 0:1:37,6
If you give a cannibal a watch. He doesn't
look at it and say, "the gears are not precise,


14
0:1:37,6 --> 0:1:44,729
they're 10,000th of an inch off" - he can't
say that. That's what I mean by a person can't


15
0:1:44,729 --> 0:1:52,59
exceed their environment. If you got in an
airplane if you're able to, you know, 2000


16
0:1:52,59 --> 0:2:0,409
years from now, a guy might look at our plane
and say "I'll never get into that crate."


17
0:2:0,409 --> 0:2:7,469
Our airplanes would come through as a crate,
or something else. But certainly, if you're


18
0:2:7,469 --> 0:2:17,54
born 2000 years from now, you couldn't have
same values and survive. The nation that can't


19
0:2:17,54 --> 0:2:24,29
exceed it's own environment will be surpassed.
Do you know what that means? Another country


20
0:2:24,29 --> 0:2:31,959
will surpass us. If China can't get passed
where they're at, if they stop and just take


21
0:2:31,959 --> 0:2:38,569
in manufacturing and don't go into automation
and modification, they will remain. There


22
0:2:38,569 --> 0:2:46,11
are many nations out there that are so primitive
they do things the way they did a thousand


23
0:2:46,11 --> 0:2:53,989
years ago, and that's up the Amazon river.
The natives build rafts the same way they


24
0:2:53,989 --> 0:3:1,659
did a thousand years ago, no change. They
bond a bundle of read together, tie it all


25
0:3:1,659 --> 0:3:11,18
together, cause that's all they ever see,
they never leave the area. So if you say "they're


26
0:3:11,18 --> 0:3:25,5
stupid" - no they're not, they live in a fixed
environment, where things are fairly uniform


27
0:3:25,5 --> 0:3:25,599
and not enough change. They don't have visitors
from other tribes that bring them other things,


28
0:3:25,599 --> 0:3:29,5
otherwise they might be brought up to hate
other tribes or they might be brought up to


29
0:3:29,5 --> 0:3:35,719
trade. The nations that trade undergo change,
cause they meet people that are different,


30
0:3:35,719 --> 0:3:44,2
and they get things that are different. No
nation all developed a vase. If a nation developed


31
0:3:44,2 --> 0:3:49,87
a vase and you're nation didn't, and they
show you how they carry water, orange juice


32
0:3:49,87 --> 0:3:56,379
around, you don't have any means of doing
it except this way, so you undergo change.


33
0:3:56,379 --> 0:4:3,37
The more nations that meet and share ideas,
not just meet, if they share ideas they undergo


34
0:4:3,37 --> 0:4:12,2
modification. But if my people undergo too
much modification, I can't control them, so


35
0:4:12,2 --> 0:4:19,449
I put a fence around my country and keep out
forgein ideologies. Or if books that come


36
0:4:19,449 --> 0:4:25,919
into my country that change people, so I can't
control them, I forbid pornography or whatever


37
0:4:25,919 --> 0:4:37,65
it is I forbid. Am I right, am I wrong? All
nations wish to survive, they can't if people


38
0:4:37,65 --> 0:4:44,419
read different kinds of books, different kinds
of characters, different kinds of social systems,


39
0:4:44,419 --> 0:4:51,21
you can't control your people that way. So
you say "I believe in democracy" nobody believes


40
0:4:51,21 --> 0:4:56,139
in democracy, they believe in what they've
been conditioned to believe in. They can't


41
0:4:56,139 --> 0:5:3,33
believe in democracy otherwise they go hear
communism, socialism, free love and all, they'd


42
0:5:3,33 --> 0:5:9,3
say "I don't know enough about them to make
up my mind which is right" they'd speak like


43
0:5:9,3 --> 0:5:15,68
that - "I don't know enough about it." Do
you understand what I'm saying? I'm upsetting


44
0:5:15,68 --> 0:5:22,849
the apple cart, so that there are no values
except the values that preserve nature man


45
0:5:22,849 --> 0:5:29,15
and his relationship to his fellow man and
nature. This is the only laws I know of, well


46
0:5:29,15 --> 0:5:35,41
if you don't care of the forest, we let them
burn and die, we will suffer. If we polute


47
0:5:35,41 --> 0:5:44,259
the oceans, we will suffer, those are things
I accept. I don't know any other system. Will


48
0:5:44,259 --> 0:5:49,43
they do that in the future? I think they'll
control things in the future, weather, hurricanes,


49
0:5:49,43 --> 0:5:58,77
earthquakes, everything. Man will learn to
control things, in his behalf, not - the other


50
0:5:58,77 --> 0:6:6,62
organisms that he keeps alive would be supportive
to that culture, do you understand that? That's


51
0:6:6,62 --> 0:6:12,379
why it'd be very difficult to deal with people
who came from another planet, with a different


52
0:6:12,379 --> 0:6:19,389
gavitational field, different lighting systems,
if they develop - they don't have to look


53
0:6:19,389 --> 0:6:25,629
like us, whatever they develop they'd be reflecting
their culture. So a guy says, I'd like to


54
0:6:25,629 --> 0:6:33,77
share ideas with you, well only if they lived
here and they had all kinds of methods of


55
0:6:33,77 --> 0:6:42,389
evaluation. But they wouldn't want to associate
with us because we're too limitted. If they've


56
0:6:42,389 --> 0:6:50,3
been around longer. So, I can't say that Fresco
tells the truth, I can only say that Fresco's


57
0:6:50,3 --> 0:6:58,18
world is based upon survey, related to man
and his relationship to the environment. That's


58
0:6:58,18 --> 0:7:6,879
what I mean by mechanistic. Cause I asked
once, a writer of a scientific book, "you


59
0:7:6,879 --> 0:7:12,68
think man is a machine?" he says "that's the
old mechanistic point of view that man is


60
0:7:12,68 --> 0:7:18,58
a machine." He didn't say "what do you mean
by machine?" There was no semantics at the


61
0:7:18,58 --> 0:7:25,5
time, you know what I mean? To know what a
man is talking about. By machine I mean that


62
0:7:25,5 --> 0:7:30,569
the eyes can not move to that position unless
there's a muscle that pulls it there, unless


63
0:7:30,569 --> 0:7:37,72
there's a mechanism in the brain, or a bright
light cause the eye to look at it. So I want


64
0:7:37,72 --> 0:7:42,699
to make little dolls, with little magnets
in their heads, you don't see, if I hold a


65
0:7:42,699 --> 0:7:50,69
magnet there, the eyes will focus on it, if
I move it, but not really. Normal people would


66
0:7:50,69 --> 0:7:58,83
think gee the machine is looking at where
ever you hold that. I can simulate that. You


67
0:7:58,83 --> 0:8:4,169
can make a machine to have facial expressions
in sympathy. If you say "I bought a new car


68
0:8:4,169 --> 0:8:8,939
and I lost it, i forgot to put the brakes
on, it went off a" - the machines eyebrows


69
0:8:8,939 --> 0:8:17,99
change - say "my god, I'm sorry to hear that"
 - but it won't feel anything. It'll react


70
0:8:17,99 --> 0:8:25,789
as though it felt something. A machine can't
feel. Bad or good about you, it can only react


71
0:8:25,789 --> 0:8:32,479
to the way it's circuits are built. Do you
understand that? That's why a machine will


72
0:8:32,479 --> 0:8:38,3
never say I'm going to take over, cause it
doesn't have ambition. It doesn't say "your


73
0:8:38,3 --> 0:8:44,12
wife is prettier than mine", or "that machine
looks nicer than the other machine" it has


74
0:8:44,12 --> 0:8:51,57
no such reaction, nor can it be given that.
No matter how you circuit a machine it can


75
0:8:51,57 --> 0:8:58,4
say that, "that machine is rusting, and it's
going to disintegrate" and it can even cry,


76
0:8:58,4 --> 0:9:6,89
but it won't feel anything. It's like a movie
of an actor doing, and you know that he didn't


77
0:9:6,89 --> 0:9:13,18
lose his wife, and he didn't get shot, although
he got shot in the movie, the movie can't


78
0:9:13,18 --> 0:9:20,55
feel, it can simulate feeling and that's why
a person says, "he's a good actor" meaning


79
0:9:20,55 --> 0:9:28,23
he can get you to cry or she can get you to
cry. Y'say "they're good actors," and sometimes


80
0:9:28,23 --> 0:9:35,75
people use that in marrying a rich man, a
girl might say "you're so wonderful, I love


81
0:9:35,75 --> 0:9:44,44
you" and the rich man feels flattered and
he marries her, then she spends a lot of money


82
0:9:44,44 --> 0:9:51,39
on a lot of things. That's simulating love.
Do you know what I mean? A prostitute that


83
0:9:51,39 --> 0:9:56,98
says "you're a lousy lay" after the day is
over, you won't come back. She says "I really


84
0:9:56,98 --> 0:10:5,49
enjoyed that sexual" - you know, after all
there are people that simulate good and bad,


85
0:10:5,49 --> 0:10:11,389
right and wrong. Knowing the difference is
difficult, if they're good at it. A salesman


86
0:10:11,389 --> 0:10:18,2
who sells you something, simulates being your
friend "let me advise you that the Ford car


87
0:10:18,2 --> 0:10:24,639
is better built than any other car today,
believe me, I'm doing you a favor" is he a


88
0:10:24,639 --> 0:10:33,99
car salesman? Or a fireman? You know, what
is he? If he's a salesman and a church goer,


89
0:10:33,99 --> 0:10:41,5
that believes in god, he'll say "I say a chevy's
best if you live in rough terrain, or a jeap'd


90
0:10:41,5 --> 0:10:46,1
be better than a chevy" you know what I mean?
That's an honest guy. He says "that's what


91
0:10:46,1 --> 0:10:53,519
I know about cars" but a person can't work
for general motors and say "get yourself an


92
0:10:53,519 --> 0:11:3,57
Italian car" I bought a Totra a Czechoslovakian
car, you know the Totra? I bought it and a


93
0:11:3,57 --> 0:11:11,87
mechanic said "I'm not gunna work on your
car, it's from a communist country" he said


94
0:11:11,87 --> 0:11:21,339
that to me. I said "is there a communist shit?
Or a Greek shit? Or a Greek pain? Or a communist


95
0:11:21,339 --> 0:11:28,889
pain?" there's no such thing as communist
science or Czechoslovakian science, there's


96
0:11:28,889 --> 0:11:36,8
only science and they call people scientists
that are not generalists, that are in one


97
0:11:36,8 --> 0:11:45,399
field. He's an optical scientist. He knows
how to grind lenses. But he's not a scientist.


98
0:11:45,399 --> 0:11:51,769
To me a scientist's one who's interested in
everything, has loyality to methodology. That


99
0:11:51,769 --> 0:11:58,43
means, if a Greek comes up with a cure for
cancer you honor him. If a Japenese scientist


100
0:11:58,43 --> 0:12:4,25
comes up with a cure for cancer, you honor
him. You honor any human being worthy of honor.


101
0:12:4,25 --> 0:12:12,56
but you don't honor only your own kind. He
was an american, that's what I like about


102
0:12:12,56 --> 0:12:19,61
it. Patriotism pulls a shield up infront of
us so we can't see things as they are. We


103
0:12:19,61 --> 0:12:25,88
can't even hear the differences of nations.
We get mad at them. If they don't uphold american


104
0:12:25,88 --> 0:12:32,73
values, or our concepts of freedom and democracy,
we get mad at people and that's what they


105
0:12:32,73 --> 0:12:38,779
want you to do. They want you to have loyality
to what they teach. But if you have loyality


106
0:12:38,779 --> 0:12:46,3
to methodology, you get rid of a fountain
pen, if it leaks and you buy a ballpoint pen,


107
0:12:46,3 --> 0:12:52,92
because no matter where it was invented if
it works better than the other pen, you use


108
0:12:52,92 --> 0:12:58,38
it. If Filipinos come up with a new type of
eye glass, that gives you better vision, you


109
0:12:58,38 --> 0:13:3,959
use it. You honor them, because you don't
 - "gee I hope a Greek did it, 'cause I'm


110
0:13:3,959 --> 0:13:11,66
greek." You blind yourself. You understand?
I don't like traditional Jews, or traditional


111
0:13:11,66 --> 0:13:18,94
Catholics, or traditional Americans, you understand?
Or any traditional group. But not because


112
0:13:18,94 --> 0:13:27,42
they're Filipinos, because of their values,
and the values they pick up. So if you discriminate


113
0:13:27,42 --> 0:13:35,13
 - "I don't wanna live nextdoor to a clansman,
because he's - let's go out and beatup a Jew


114
0:13:35,13 --> 0:13:42,19
or a nigger or a Filipino, or any damn foreigner"
I don't find that fulfilling, I find that


115
0:13:42,19 --> 0:13:50,54
to be a limitted viewpoint. Racial prejudice
is like patriotism toward a certain race.


116
0:13:50,54 --> 0:13:58,529
"I'm a Greek and I'm proud of it" once you
do that, you damage a person. Say "I'm a Greek,


117
0:13:58,529 --> 0:14:3,79
and I like certain Greeks, and Filipinos,
and certain blacks, and certain Italians"


118
0:14:3,79 --> 0:14:9,91
 - if you meet Italian gangsters you say "Italians
are gangsters" that's when you're projecting,


119
0:14:9,91 --> 0:14:17,23
one set of values into all Italians. Anyway,
that ought to give you some perspective of


120
0:14:17,23 --> 0:16:17,23
the world you live in.
