CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: That was an enthusiastic
intro, and credit goes to Ms. Bamer`s (ph)


2
0:0:24,5 --> 0:0:28,369
students for today`s hello. Glad to have all
of you, middle and high school students out


3
0:0:28,369 --> 0:0:35,1
there watching as CNN STUDENT NEWS kicks off
its Tuesday, November 27th broadcast.


4
0:0:35,1 --> 0:0:38,86
Starting in the U.S. northeast today, we`ve
talked about how the recovery from Superstorm


5
0:0:38,86 --> 0:0:43,199
Sandy is going to take a while. There are
thousands of people who can`t get back in


6
0:0:43,199 --> 0:0:49,59
their homes, miles of pipes have to be reconnected,
mold, as we show you yesterday, has to be


7
0:0:49,59 --> 0:0:50,949
dealt with. And bills.


8
0:0:50,949 --> 0:0:55,629
Everything from cleanup costs to unpaid bills
from people who had to evacuate. Those are


9
0:0:55,629 --> 0:1:1,59
piling up. These were few of the issues brought
up yesterday, during a state hearing in New


10
0:1:1,59 --> 0:1:6,2
Jersey. Officials there are trying to get
a handle on two things : how to pay for reconstruction


11
0:1:6,2 --> 0:1:11,25
efforts and what kinds of plans can be made
to better protect the area if another storm


12
0:1:11,25 --> 0:1:11,99
hits.


13
0:1:11,99 --> 0:1:17,2
Meanwhile, New York has gotten $27 million
from the federal government to hire about


14
0:1:17,2 --> 0:1:23,689
5,000 unemployed New Yorkers for work on Sandy
cleanup projects. The job will be full-time,


15
0:1:23,689 --> 0:1:28,509
but temporary. New York`s governor and New
York City`s mayor are asking for more federal


16
0:1:28,509 --> 0:1:31,27
money to make additional repairs in their
state.


17
0:1:31,27 --> 0:1:32,56
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


18
0:1:32,56 --> 0:1:37,24
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s first "Shoutout"
goes out to Mr. Weisbeck`s senior government


19
0:1:37,24 --> 0:1:42,46
class at Timber Lake High School in Timber
Lake, South Dakota.


20
0:1:42,46 --> 0:1:49,219
Lewis Hamilton, Dario Frachitti and Juan Pablo
Montoya are all known for their roles in what?


21
0:1:49,219 --> 0:1:55,96
You know what to do. Are they all involved
in auto racing, theater, horse racing or Congress?


22
0:1:55,96 --> 0:2:2,49
You`ve got three seconds, go!


23
0:2:2,49 --> 0:2:9,92
All three of these guys are involved in auto
racing. That`s your answer, and that`s your


24
0:2:9,92 --> 0:2:10,44
"Shoutout."


25
0:2:10,44 --> 0:2:12,2
(END VIDEO CLIP)


26
0:2:12,2 --> 0:2:18,6
AZUZ: And you can add Tristan Nunez to that
list. At 17 years old, he`s around your age,


27
0:2:18,6 --> 0:2:24,19
he is one of the youngest auto racing champions
ever. And what better spokesman against distracted


28
0:2:24,19 --> 0:2:28,64
driving than someone who wants to race cars
for a living? Victor Blackwell joins us now


29
0:2:28,64 --> 0:2:33,36
with the tale of two talents: one about a
driver, one about somebody who is hoping that


30
0:2:33,36 --> 0:2:36,1
one day, phones and driving will disconnect.


31
0:2:36,1 --> 0:2:36,82
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


32
0:2:36,82 --> 0:2:41,18
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right, drivers! Come
get in line over here, please!


33
0:2:41,18 --> 0:2:45,89
VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Race
car drivers on a race track. No big surprise.


34
0:2:45,89 --> 0:2:49,8
What might surprise you is that the favorite
to win this race is just 17-years old.


35
0:2:49,8 --> 0:2:55,25
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And you have half the field
this side, half the field this size.


36
0:2:55,25 --> 0:3:0,33
BLACKWELL: He is Tristan Nunez from Boca Raton,
Florida. He started racing go-carts at 13.


37
0:3:0,33 --> 0:3:2,58
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just do what you know.


38
0:3:2,58 --> 0:3:7,81
BLACKWELL: And then graduated to this at 15,
before he was licensed to drive through his


39
0:3:7,81 --> 0:3:8,0
neighborhood.


40
0:3:8,0 --> 0:3:11,64
TRISTAN NUNEZ, TEEN RACECAR DRIVER: My mom
and myself actually feel safer driving on


41
0:3:11,64 --> 0:3:15,96
a race track with professional drivers than
driving on the regular roads with people who


42
0:3:15,96 --> 0:3:18,51
have no idea what they are doing.


43
0:3:18,51 --> 0:3:23,7
BLACKWELL: He revs up to above 150 miles per
hour around this track.


44
0:3:23,7 --> 0:3:25,45
(on camera): At that speed, there can be any
little distraction.


45
0:3:25,45 --> 0:3:25,99
NUNEZ: Yes,


46
0:3:25,99 --> 0:3:28,44
BLACKWELL: It can be - and injury could be
death.


47
0:3:28,44 --> 0:3:28,99
NUNEZ: Fatal.


48
0:3:28,99 --> 0:3:32,3
BLACKWELL (voice over): Actually, that can
happen at any speed.


49
0:3:32,3 --> 0:3:36,78
Before the start of the racing season, a little
distraction off the track nearly created a


50
0:3:36,78 --> 0:3:37,73
major problem.


51
0:3:37,73 --> 0:3:40,98
NUNEZ: I was with my mom in the car, and we
almost got into accident because she was face


52
0:3:40,98 --> 0:3:42,24
booking, emailing, whatever. Distracted.


53
0:3:42,24 --> 0:3:46,57
DIANE NUNEZ, MOTHER: We almost reared-ended
somebody, and he, you know, that`s when we


54
0:3:46,57 --> 0:3:50,23
really - it really hit us, you know, and he
is like, mom, you`ve got to put the phone


55
0:3:50,23 --> 0:3:50,32
down.


56
0:3:50,32 --> 0:3:55,45
BLACKWELL: So Tristan and his mom, Diane Nunez
had an idea: to inspire other people, especially


57
0:3:55,45 --> 0:4:1,7
young people to put the phone down, by branding
his car the "don`t text and drive car."


58
0:4:1,7 --> 0:4:4,4
DIANE NUNEZ: And we put all over the car,
and put in on a suit and then put it on the


59
0:4:4,4 --> 0:4:6,11
Web site and just took off.


60
0:4:6,11 --> 0:4:10,7
BLACKWELL (on camera): And you`ve got the
bracelet because when they raise up there,


61
0:4:10,7 --> 0:4:10,59
their hand ...


62
0:4:10,59 --> 0:4:11,7
NUNEZ: Their hand ...


63
0:4:11,7 --> 0:4:11,4
BLACKWELL: ... with the phone.


64
0:4:11,4 --> 0:4:12,93
NUNEZ: With the phone, they see it, exactly.


65
0:4:12,93 --> 0:4:13,32
BLACKWELL: Yeah.


66
0:4:13,32 --> 0:4:16,199
NUNEZ: So, I mean - it just serves as a constant
reminder not to do it.


67
0:4:16,199 --> 0:4:19,97
BLACKWELL (voice over): Hundreds of teens
have pledged to not text and drive, some had


68
0:4:19,97 --> 0:4:23,39
even signed Tristan`s car as part of the pledge.


69
0:4:23,39 --> 0:4:27,43
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s just distracting.
It`s - you get caught up in another world,


70
0:4:27,43 --> 0:4:29,37
completely separate from what you are trying
to do.


71
0:4:29,37 --> 0:4:32,38
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is not really a lot
of teenage race car drivers out there, so


72
0:4:32,38 --> 0:4:34,93
it was - it was definitely good for them to
go on to a teenager`s car.


73
0:4:34,93 --> 0:4:38,47
DIANE NUNEZ: I know we are not going to stop
it, but at least it`s going to bring more


74
0:4:38,47 --> 0:4:44,8
awareness to people.


75
0:4:44,8 --> 0:4:51,65
BLACKWELL: Tristan was the big winner on this
day at Road Atlanta (ph).


76
0:4:51,65 --> 0:4:52,94
NUNEZ: I would be here.


77
0:4:52,94 --> 0:4:57,0
BLACKSTONE: And he tells teens to look up
to him. The key to his success on the track


78
0:4:57,0 --> 0:4:59,86
is the same key to staying safe on the road.


79
0:4:59,86 --> 0:5:4,49
NUNEZ: You have to have 100 percent focus,
you can`t lose your focus for any - any reason


80
0:5:4,49 --> 0:5:5,1
at all.


81
0:5:5,1 --> 0:5:5,75
(END VIDEOTAPE)


82
0:5:5,75 --> 0:5:6,73
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


83
0:5:6,73 --> 0:5:9,93
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Time for "Shoutout Extra
Credit."


84
0:5:9,93 --> 0:5:17,21
What game was invented by James Naismith?
Here we go. Was it basketball, Monopoly, Mario


85
0:5:17,21 --> 0:5:24,42
Bros. or American football? Another three
seconds on the clock and go.


86
0:5:24,42 --> 0:5:34,33
While teaching phys. ed at a YMCA in 1891,
James Naismith invented basketball. That`s


87
0:5:34,33 --> 0:5:38,3
your answer and that`s your Shoutout Extra
Credit.


88
0:5:38,3 --> 0:5:40,32
(END VIDEO CLIP)


89
0:5:40,32 --> 0:5:45,86
AZUZ: So James Naismith invented it, Michael
Jordan mastered it, Wilt Chamberlain holds


90
0:5:45,86 --> 0:5:51,139
the record for the most point scored in a
single NBA game. That`s 100. But as far as


91
0:5:51,139 --> 0:5:58,889
the most point scored in a college game- go,
that record has stood at 113 sine 1954. At


92
0:5:58,889 --> 0:6:4,5
least until this sophomore dunked it. His
name is Jack Taylor (ph). He goes to Grinell


93
0:6:4,5 --> 0:6:9,36
College in Iowa. He`s 5 feet 10, a shooting
guard, and he recently had a game that was


94
0:6:9,36 --> 0:6:17,37
so amazing that Kobe Bryant and LeBron James
tweeted about it. 138 points. That`s the new


95
0:6:17,37 --> 0:6:22,52
record. That`s what Taylor netted in a single
game. CNN Soledad O`Brien spoke to him about


96
0:6:22,52 --> 0:6:27,21
it. How he managed to put up so many points
and how that was unusual, even for someone


97
0:6:27,21 --> 0:6:28,52
as talented as Taylor.


98
0:6:28,52 --> 0:6:29,11
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


99
0:6:29,11 --> 0:6:33,1
SOLEDAD O`BRIEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I guess,
congratulations first are in order. You were


100
0:6:33,1 --> 0:6:39,41
averaging roughly 23 points per game before
the big game. What do you think happened that


101
0:6:39,41 --> 0:6:39,62
day?


102
0:6:39,62 --> 0:6:43,82
JACK TAYLOR, GRINELL COLLEGE BASKETBALL PLAYER:
Yeah. I think it was - I think it was kind


103
0:6:43,82 --> 0:6:49,2
of once in a lifetime thing to happen. Coming
into the game, I knew I was going to get more


104
0:6:49,2 --> 0:6:56,419
shots than usual. But I definitely hit more
shots than I though that I would and at half


105
0:6:56,419 --> 0:7:2,7
time I had 58. My team and coaches kind of
gathered around me and we were going to get


106
0:7:2,7 --> 0:7:9,139
me the ball every time down the floor. So,
this record won`t be possible without my unselfish


107
0:7:9,139 --> 0:7:9,36
teammates.


108
0:7:9,36 --> 0:7:12,13
O`BRIEN: You know, it`s interesting, because
some people give me a little flack about the


109
0:7:12,13 --> 0:7:20,54
selfishness thing. Stuart Scott On ESPN said
this: "Not a big fan of Jack Taylor`s 138-point


110
0:7:20,54 --> 0:7:26,76
in Grinell win. He took 108 shots, including
71 3`s. Just say that out loud. Now say "team"!


111
0:7:26,76 --> 0:7:33,26
He`s basically insinuating that you were - were
a ball hog, how do you respond to that?


112
0:7:33,26 --> 0:7:36,98
TAYLOR: Yeah, I mean I definitely was a ball
hog ...


113
0:7:36,98 --> 0:7:37,53
(laughter)


114
0:7:37,53 --> 0:7:45,12
TAYLOR: But my teammates kept getting me the
ball. When I would pass it off to them, they


115
0:7:45,12 --> 0:7:49,639
were trying to get me the ball right back,
because they knew I was hot.


116
0:7:49,639 --> 0:7:55,54
And in the second half, we started going for
the record when - when my shots were falling.


117
0:7:55,54 --> 0:8:1,669
So, it was a team effort to get me the ball,
and they kept encouraging me to shoot, which


118
0:8:1,669 --> 0:8:3,6
only gave me more confidence.


119
0:8:3,6 --> 0:8:4,21
(END VIDEOTAPE)


120
0:8:4,21 --> 0:8:9,7
AZUZ: You`d need more confidence to attempt
a record like that. I don`t think I could


121
0:8:9,7 --> 0:8:11,8
score that much just shooting hoops on my
own.


122
0:8:11,8 --> 0:8:15,85
So, 138 points is 138 points, or is it?


123
0:8:15,85 --> 0:8:20,62
There is no disputing what Taylor score, but
as you just heard, some people do dispute


124
0:8:20,62 --> 0:8:23,69
whether he should be recognized for how he
did it.


125
0:8:23,69 --> 0:8:28,36
On out blog at CNNSTUDENTNEWS.COM we are talking
about this. We`d love to hear your opinion


126
0:8:28,36 --> 0:8:32,729
on whether Taylor was a ball hog or a basketball
star?


127
0:8:32,729 --> 0:8:37,649
Please, on that blog, it`s first names only,
please include only your first name.


128
0:8:37,649 --> 0:8:43,49
Before we go, we`ve got some interesting images
for you of Santas getting in shape. It`s the


129
0:8:43,49 --> 0:8:47,8
Santa Claus festival in Sydney, Australia
where it`s actually summer now, so St. Nick


130
0:8:47,8 --> 0:8:52,54
could show off his lack of a tan. The run
benefited children in need, it`s called a


131
0:8:52,54 --> 0:8:58,369
Claus for a Cause, and some, as you just saw,
swapped the sleigh for skis. Fireworks tried


132
0:8:58,369 --> 0:9:5,72
to outshine the Rudolph, one Santa used a
water jetpack to do that. Launching the rocket


133
0:9:5,72 --> 0:9:11,92
that smacked into and then lit up this massive
Christmas Tree. You could say it was sheer


134
0:9:11,92 --> 0:9:17,339
Santamonium, an incomparable Santabration,
a seriously Santalizing scheme to set the


135
0:9:17,339 --> 0:9:22,1
stage for the Christmas season. The advent
of this puns can leave you in a holi-daze.


136
0:9:22,1 --> 0:9:26,11
So we are just going to wish you a merry Tuesday.
Look forward to bringing more news down the


137
0:9:26,11 --> 0:11:26,11
chimney tomorrow. For CNN STUDENT NEWS, I`m
Carl Azuz.
