her and her boyfriend.


37
0:2:10,884 --> 0:2:12,43

That's because people like us

selling drugs and doing drugs,

your parents did, because you

126
0:6:40,431 --> 0:6:43,14
DEREK JAMES: I heard a
definition many years ago


127
0:6:43,14 --> 0:6:46,91
about the difference a North
Walian and a South Walian.


128
0:6:46,91 --> 0:6:49,81
And the difference was between
belt and braces.


129
0:6:49,81 --> 0:6:53,31
The South Walian always wore
a belt slung under his beer


130
0:6:53,31 --> 0:6:57,1
belly, and was a roistering,
boisterous taffy.


131
0:6:57,1 --> 0:7:1,14
Whereas a North Walian always
wore braces and hunched them


132
0:7:1,14 --> 0:7:5,84
forward as if he were forever
plodding uphill.


133
0:7:5,84 --> 0:7:8,42
Most of the coal that was mined
in the Swansea area and


134
0:7:8,42 --> 0:7:12,34
up the Swansea Valley
was used in Swansea


135
0:7:12,34 --> 0:7:15,18
for the metal refining.


136
0:7:15,18 --> 0:7:21,23
Swansea was then, at one time,
the major metal refining


137
0:7:21,23 --> 0:7:23,66
center for the entire world.


138
0:7:23,66 --> 0:7:26,99
That's an example from the old
days, when children were


139
0:7:26,99 --> 0:7:27,53
underground.


140
0:7:27,53 --> 0:7:31,46
And it was only about 1840- odd
that they raised the age


141
0:7:31,46 --> 0:7:34,28
of children working
underground to 12.


142
0:7:34,28 --> 0:7:37,26
But no, Mrs. Thatcher
shut the lot down.


143
0:7:37,26 --> 0:7:39,39
It's awful when you think that
the amount of skill and the


144
0:7:39,39 --> 0:7:42,8
amount of knowledge that was
here, the knowledge base that


145
0:7:42,8 --> 0:7:44,23
they had, and it all
just withered away.


146
0:7:44,23 --> 0:7:48,23



147
0:7:48,23 --> 0:7:50,68
Employment after the heavy
industry went as not good.


148
0:7:50,68 --> 0:7:54,14
There was a short period in the
'60s when there was quite


149
0:7:54,14 --> 0:7:55,55
a lot of work around.


150
0:7:55,55 --> 0:7:59,17
But that declined all through
the '70s and the '80s, until


151
0:7:59,17 --> 0:8:2,986
the late '90s.


152
0:8:2,986 --> 0:8:7,26
Yeah, that's played a part in
the present drug problem, I


153
0:8:7,26 --> 0:8:11,71
think, in Swansea, and
the alcoholism.


154
0:8:11,71 --> 0:8:14,47
Of course, the system under
which we live--


155
0:8:14,47 --> 0:8:17,17
the capitalist system--
is so competitive.


156
0:8:17,17 --> 0:8:21,926
And it's a continual stress
on the individual.


157
0:8:21,926 --> 0:8:26,14
And younger people, I feel, who
can't get into the stream


158
0:8:26,14 --> 0:8:31,785
and compete and can't get
work just lose heart.


159
0:8:31,785 --> 0:8:37,299
And then they descend into a
drug culture, which is almost


160
0:8:37,299 --> 0:8:38,86

Yeah, Mark.

0:18:53,508 --> 0:18:55,843
Have a chat with Dennis-- this,
that, and the other.


396
0:18:55,843 --> 0:18:57,711
Tidy guy.


397
0:18:57,711 --> 0:19:0,216
And that's how we
clicked, really.


398
0:19:0,216 --> 0:19:1,8
LEE DENNIS: I mean, I've
always had a little


399
0:19:1,8 --> 0:19:3,42
soft spot for her.


400
0:19:3,42 --> 0:19:5,51
RACHEL REES: We'll see how it
goes from here now, isn't it?


401
0:19:5,51 --> 0:19:5,89
LEE DENNIS: Yeah.


402
0:19:5,89 --> 0:19:8,615
RACHEL REES: Just take it day by
day and help each other out


403
0:19:8,615 --> 0:19:10,66
as much as we can.


404
0:19:10,66 --> 0:19:12,35
Yeah?


405
0:19:12,35 --> 0:19:14,87
LEE DENNIS: February 27,
I got out of jail.


406
0:19:14,87 --> 0:19:19,324
But when I moved in here,
it was stinking.


407
0:19:19,324 --> 0:19:20,55
This is my bedroom.


408
0:19:20,55 --> 0:19:23,42
I'm gonna put my
bed down here.


409
0:19:23,42 --> 0:19:25,166
Put the bed down here--


410
0:19:25,166 --> 0:19:27,74
I got my bedside cabinet--


411
0:19:27,74 --> 0:19:34,975
and lay the carpet and put my
wardrobes down here and my


412
0:19:34,975 --> 0:19:36,72
chest of drawers behind
the door.


413
0:19:36,72 --> 0:19:41,72



414
0:19:41,72 --> 0:19:43,15
RACHEL REES: You can't put
it in your ear, can he?


415
0:19:43,15 --> 0:19:46,622
LEE DENNIS: It's all
right like that.


416
0:19:46,622 --> 0:19:50,72
That's my first ever Swansea
City tattoo--


417
0:19:50,72 --> 0:19:52,84
the proudest ever.


418
0:19:52,84 --> 0:19:57,35
I've been to a few prisons, as
well, and I always wear it


419
0:19:57,35 --> 0:20:0,1
with pride, always walk around
with my top off.


420
0:20:0,1 --> 0:20:1,43
And I want to get clean.


421
0:20:1,43 --> 0:20:5,38
I'm starting treatment now on
the 26th of this month.


422
0:20:5,38 --> 0:20:9,395
Because I tattooed myself in
jail, I had test results done.


423
0:20:9,395 --> 0:20:13,73
I had a letter then from
the nurse, saying come


424
0:20:13,73 --> 0:20:15,63
down and see me.


425
0:20:15,63 --> 0:20:17,56
I need to see you urgently.


426
0:20:17,56 --> 0:20:20,66
And when I went down, she says,
I'm very sorry, but you


427
0:20:20,66 --> 0:20:25,83
have got hep C. I'm gonna
try a cupboard, put a


428
0:20:25,83 --> 0:20:27,672
cupboard up on here.


429
0:20:27,672 --> 0:20:29,98
I'm gonna paint the ceiling.


430
0:20:29,98 --> 0:20:31,115
I'm gonna paint that.


431
0:20:31,115 --> 0:20:33,19
It'll probably be tomorrow.


432
0:20:33,19 --> 0:20:36,4
And look, there's
bits of blood.


433
0:20:36,4 --> 0:20:38,39
When you're cooking up
and that, you draw


434
0:20:38,39 --> 0:20:41,36
the blood into yourself.


435
0:20:41,36 --> 0:20:45,21
And when you draw so much in,
there's a little bit of blood


436
0:20:45,21 --> 0:20:49,25
left in, and they
just squirt it.


437
0:20:49,25 --> 0:20:51,17
There was some on
here as well.


438
0:20:51,17 --> 0:20:53,97
I put a bit on there.


439
0:20:53,97 --> 0:20:56,11
My stereo's in my mum's it is.


440
0:20:56,11 --> 0:20:56,425
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Why?


441
0:20:56,425 --> 0:20:58,15
What kind of music
do you like?


442
0:20:58,15 --> 0:20:59,555
LEE DENNIS: I like all different
types of music.


443
0:20:59,555 --> 0:21:1,239
I got loads of music here.


444
0:21:1,239 --> 0:21:6,62



445
0:21:6,62 --> 0:21:14,4
R&B, Garage, R&B, Fleetwood
Mac Seven Wonders--


446
0:21:14,4 --> 0:21:17,53
if I live to see the
Seven Wonders.


447
0:21:17,53 --> 0:21:19,2
RACHEL REES: There
was an abscess.


448
0:21:19,2 --> 0:21:23,19
I had to go in for an operation
on that, because I


449
0:21:23,19 --> 0:21:27,788
missed there.


450
0:21:27,788 --> 0:21:33,36
You know, basically, my
veins are kaput now.


451
0:21:33,36 --> 0:21:35,165
That's going into
another abscess.


452
0:21:35,165 --> 0:21:38,588



453
0:21:38,588 --> 0:21:40,95
That one's not too bad.


454
0:21:40,95 --> 0:21:44,94
If I wasn't on the heroin, I'd
cry my eyes out for my kids


455
0:21:44,94 --> 0:21:46,81
now, you know?


456
0:21:46,81 --> 0:21:51,15
Don't get me wrong, I love
them all to bits, but you


457
0:21:51,15 --> 0:21:55,53
know, I can't really see them
while I'm in this predicament.


458
0:21:55,53 --> 0:21:57,794
LEE DENNIS: This is gonna
go up in my bedroom.


459
0:21:57,794 --> 0:22:1,77



460
0:22:1,77 --> 0:22:5,285
RACHEL REES: Other
way round, babes.


461
0:22:5,285 --> 0:22:7,89
LEE DENNIS: Is that all right?


462
0:22:7,89 --> 0:22:9,14
RACHEL REES: The other
way, babes.


463
0:22:9,14 --> 0:22:13,67



464
0:22:13,67 --> 0:22:18,27
LEE DENNIS: (SINGING) When I was
just a little boy, I asked


465
0:22:18,27 --> 0:22:21,81
my mother, what shall I be?


466
0:22:21,81 --> 0:22:23,83
Shall I be Swansea?


467
0:22:23,83 --> 0:22:25,78
Shall I be scum?


468
0:22:25,78 --> 0:22:28,48
This is what she said to me.


469
0:22:28,48 --> 0:22:34,18
Take your father's gun, and
shoot the Cardiff scum.


470
0:22:34,18 --> 0:22:37,5
Forever will be, my son.


471
0:22:37,5 --> 0:22:39,33
You'll always be Swansea.


472
0:22:39,33 --> 0:22:40,6
Who are we?


473
0:22:40,6 --> 0:22:41,89
Jack Army!


474
0:22:41,89 --> 0:22:43,0
Who are we?


475
0:22:43,0 --> 0:22:44,25
Jack Army!


476
0:22:44,25 --> 0:22:48,63



477
0:22:48,63 --> 0:22:52,8
LEE ANDERSON: Lee Anderson, in
Swansea, like, in a shared


478
0:22:52,8 --> 0:22:55,41
flat, with smackheads,
down and outs.


479
0:22:55,41 --> 0:22:55,92
CLINT RYAN JONES: Aye.


480
0:22:55,92 --> 0:22:57,0
All right?


481
0:22:57,0 --> 0:22:59,2
This is Clint, the old
famous Clinty.


482
0:22:59,2 --> 0:23:4,86
This is a friend's bedsit,
as they call it.


483
0:23:4,86 --> 0:23:7,5
He said I could stay here for a
couple of days, so I've made


484
0:23:7,5 --> 0:23:8,32
myself a room.


485
0:23:8,32 --> 0:23:11,14
[FARTING]


486
0:23:11,14 --> 0:23:13,5
LEE ANDERSON: Oh, had to
come out, didn't it?


487
0:23:13,5 --> 0:23:16,17
CLINT RYAN JONES: I started a
program now with methadone.


488
0:23:16,17 --> 0:23:17,39
It's done me a world of good.


489
0:23:17,39 --> 0:23:19,955
For some people, it'll
make them worse.


490
0:23:19,955 --> 0:23:24,74
And then they have a
heroin habit on top


491
0:23:24,74 --> 0:23:26,42
of a methadone habit.


492
0:23:26,42 --> 0:23:28,76
LEE ANDERSON: It's people
like Clint are stupid.


493
0:23:28,76 --> 0:23:30,92
They think it's the answer.


494
0:23:30,92 --> 0:23:31,43
But it's not.


495
0:23:31,43 --> 0:23:33,71
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN):
You disagree with him?


496
0:23:33,71 --> 0:23:34,78
CLINT RYAN JONES: It's going
again in a minute.


497
0:23:34,78 --> 0:23:36,22
[FARTING]


498
0:23:36,22 --> 0:23:36,7
CLINT RYAN JONES: Right.


499
0:23:36,7 --> 0:23:37,92
Better out than in, isn't it?


500
0:23:37,92 --> 0:23:38,79
You know what I mean?


501
0:23:38,79 --> 0:23:42,135
Because I went off the heroin,
and when I get to that point


502
0:23:42,135 --> 0:23:45,99
when it's making me better, I'll
stop using heroin, and


503
0:23:45,99 --> 0:23:49,21
then eventually, in a couple of
months, gradually come off


504
0:23:49,21 --> 0:23:50,74
the methadone.


505
0:23:50,74 --> 0:23:54,16
And I'll be a brand new, squeaky
clean person again.


506
0:23:54,16 --> 0:23:55,41
LEE ANDERSON: With
rotten teeth.


507
0:23:55,41 --> 0:24:0,335



508
0:24:0,335 --> 0:24:3,18
KRISTIAN EVANS: I've been on
it since I can remember--


509
0:24:3,18 --> 0:24:4,82
14, which is the best
part of my life.


510
0:24:4,82 --> 0:24:5,74
CLINT RYAN JONES: Anyway,
I'm just doing about


511
0:24:5,74 --> 0:24:6,83
my day to day thing.


512
0:24:6,83 --> 0:24:8,24
Come on, let's go down
the shop now.


513
0:24:8,24 --> 0:24:9,48
KRISTIAN EVANS: Is it?


514
0:24:9,48 --> 0:24:10,41
LEE ANDERSON (OFFSCREEN):
Come along if you want.


515
0:24:10,41 --> 0:24:11,34
KRISTIAN EVANS: Hm?


516
0:24:11,34 --> 0:24:14,46
Well, if it's all about him--
he's a fucking idiot.


517
0:24:14,46 --> 0:24:16,34
CLINT RYAN JONES: Before I had
the bedsit, this is where we


518
0:24:16,34 --> 0:24:18,48
used to go up to have a dig.


519
0:24:18,48 --> 0:24:22,32
"Dig up" means inject your
heroin and what have you.


520
0:24:22,32 --> 0:24:23,96
Bish, bash, bosh.


521
0:24:23,96 --> 0:24:24,924
LEE ANDERSON: Look,
there's pin tops.


522
0:24:24,924 --> 0:24:26,63
Look, there, where
he's standing.


523
0:24:26,63 --> 0:24:28,106
CLINT RYAN JONES: This is where
we used to go for a


524
0:24:28,106 --> 0:24:28,613
pipe, down here.


525
0:24:28,613 --> 0:24:29,79
This is where we used to go.


526
0:24:29,79 --> 0:24:32,2
LEE ANDERSON: We started--


527
0:24:32,2 --> 0:24:33,78
we get the needles from there.


528
0:24:33,78 --> 0:24:35,23
KRISTIAN EVANS: It's
our fault why the


529
0:24:35,23 --> 0:24:36,0
needles are down there.


530
0:24:36,0 --> 0:24:36,39
LEE ANDERSON: Yeah.


531
0:24:36,39 --> 0:24:36,78
People should clean up.


532
0:24:36,78 --> 0:24:38,31
KRISTIAN EVANS: They
give us things--


533
0:24:38,31 --> 0:24:39,755
CLINT RYAN JONES: Hang on, let
me put this camera right now.


534
0:24:39,755 --> 0:24:40,3
Hang on.


535
0:24:40,3 --> 0:24:42,44
It's not our fault the needles
are down there.


536
0:24:42,44 --> 0:24:44,14
We clean up what
we used to use.


537
0:24:44,14 --> 0:24:44,63
KRISTIAN EVANS: Yeah, yeah.


538
0:24:44,63 --> 0:24:47,87
CLINT RYAN JONES: Months ago,
when I used to come here, I


539
0:24:47,87 --> 0:24:50,7
always used to take my doings
with me and put them in the


540
0:24:50,7 --> 0:24:52,23
same bin and take them back
to the drug project.


541
0:24:52,23 --> 0:24:54,93
The dirty smackheads that are
around that leave needles


542
0:24:54,93 --> 0:24:56,33
about then and what have you--


543
0:24:56,33 --> 0:24:58,37
we are the clean smackheads,
the user.


544
0:24:58,37 --> 0:25:1,62
We are users, not smackheads.


545
0:25:1,62 --> 0:25:4,74
Whoa, watch you don't sit on
any fucking needles, mate.


546
0:25:4,74 --> 0:25:6,61
KRISTIAN EVANS: I would have
thought the heroin


547
0:25:6,61 --> 0:25:7,55
consumption--


548
0:25:7,55 --> 0:25:12,85
considering that 90% of heroin
comes from Afghanistan, how


549
0:25:12,85 --> 0:25:15,82
much has come into the country,
considering a our


550
0:25:15,82 --> 0:25:16,2
British troops--


551
0:25:16,2 --> 0:25:16,6
CLINT RYAN JONES: But it's
not all about fucking


552
0:25:16,6 --> 0:25:18,3
Afghanistan, really.


553
0:25:18,3 --> 0:25:20,22
Why are we using it, you know?


554
0:25:20,22 --> 0:25:21,1
KRISTIAN EVANS: Yes, I know.


555
0:25:21,1 --> 0:25:24,13
But the documentary's
about how there's


556
0:25:24,13 --> 0:25:24,96
been such an increase.


557
0:25:24,96 --> 0:25:25,562
CLINT RYAN JONES: Yeah, but
they want to know about


558
0:25:25,562 --> 0:25:26,24
Swansea and things--


559
0:25:26,24 --> 0:25:27,76
why are we using it so much?


560
0:25:27,76 --> 0:25:29,31
And basically, at the
end of the day--


561
0:25:29,31 --> 0:25:30,12
KRISTIAN EVANS: Well, I wasn't
talking about that.


562
0:25:30,12 --> 0:25:30,52
CLINT RYAN JONES: Why?


563
0:25:30,52 --> 0:25:32,1
Because there's boredom.


564
0:25:32,1 --> 0:25:34,79
KRISTIAN EVANS: I think that
a lot of heroin addicts are


565
0:25:34,79 --> 0:25:41,6
using the actual, "oh, I'm
addicted to heroin" to get


566
0:25:41,6 --> 0:25:44,65
away with the way that they're
looking, the way that they


567
0:25:44,65 --> 0:25:49,69
talk to people, and the
actual way that


568
0:25:49,69 --> 0:25:50,82
they live their lifestyle.


569
0:25:50,82 --> 0:25:53,97
I like to think that I've
proven them all wrong.


570
0:25:53,97 --> 0:25:57,46
I've been a heroin addict since
I was 18 years of age,


571
0:25:57,46 --> 0:25:58,99
which is nearly 10 years.


572
0:25:58,99 --> 0:26:1,77
Yeah, I'm well known around town
for shoplifting to fund


573
0:26:1,77 --> 0:26:2,902
for my habit.


574
0:26:2,902 --> 0:26:6,57
But fingers crossed, that if
someone walked past me in the


575
0:26:6,57 --> 0:26:8,65
street, they wouldn't
think that I was a


576
0:26:8,65 --> 0:26:11,55
dodgy-looking bastard--


577
0:26:11,55 --> 0:26:12,29
excuse my French--


578
0:26:12,29 --> 0:26:17,74
and consider me to look like a
typical smackhead like you see


579
0:26:17,74 --> 0:26:19,78
off Trainspotting, you know?


580
0:26:19,78 --> 0:26:24,34
I can't see any reason why I
can't turn my life around.


581
0:26:24,34 --> 0:26:27,22
LEE ANDERSON: [INAUDIBLE].


582
0:26:27,22 --> 0:26:30,11
[INAUDIBLE].


583
0:26:30,11 --> 0:26:31,77
CLINT RYAN JONES: OK, we
having a dig, are we?


584
0:26:31,77 --> 0:26:32,11
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.


585
0:26:32,11 --> 0:26:34,96
CLINT RYAN JONES: Positive
mental attitude, as I put


586
0:26:34,96 --> 0:26:35,16
underneath.


587
0:26:35,16 --> 0:26:37,64
You know, I wake up in the bed
in the morning, and I thought,


588
0:26:37,64 --> 0:26:40,34
I see the sign that's
on the wall.


589
0:26:40,34 --> 0:26:41,93
So I look and I think, right.


590
0:26:41,93 --> 0:26:45,11
PMA, PMA--


591
0:26:45,11 --> 0:26:46,385
Positive Mental Attitude.


592
0:26:46,385 --> 0:26:49,31
So, at the end of the day,
positive mental attitude.


593
0:26:49,31 --> 0:26:50,69
Right, what am I going
to do today?


594
0:26:50,69 --> 0:26:53,13
Straight to the chemist--
they'll have my methadone--


595
0:26:53,13 --> 0:26:54,1
positive mental attitude.


596
0:26:54,1 --> 0:26:54,92
There's one.


597
0:26:54,92 --> 0:27:1,93
Number two, go and score
a fucking bag.


598
0:27:1,93 --> 0:27:3,5
Positive mental attitude,
yeah?


599
0:27:3,5 --> 0:27:6,3



600
0:27:6,3 --> 0:27:7,9
My spelling's not too
good, though.


601
0:27:7,9 --> 0:27:9,15
Sorry.


602
0:27:9,15 --> 0:27:14,62



603
0:27:14,62 --> 0:27:17,93
I just want to be part of my
kids and my ex-wife, you know?


604
0:27:17,93 --> 0:27:20,89
I just want the chance
to be a daddy, yeah?


605
0:27:20,89 --> 0:27:22,77
I love my babies.


606
0:27:22,77 --> 0:27:26,74
I said to myself, PMA.


607
0:27:26,74 --> 0:27:30,88
I'm going to stop using any type
of drug before I get in


608
0:27:30,88 --> 0:27:33,46
touch with my children ever
again, because it wouldn't be


609
0:27:33,46 --> 0:27:37,16
fair on my children if I
was to go, oh, that's


610
0:27:37,16 --> 0:27:37,97
my daddy, that is.


611
0:27:37,97 --> 0:27:39,71
Ah, but your daddy's a junkie.


612
0:27:39,71 --> 0:27:42,4



613
0:27:42,4 --> 0:27:43,46
CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN):
My old man's never been on the


614
0:27:43,46 --> 0:27:46,58
streets, homeless.


615
0:27:46,58 --> 0:27:49,93
He's just been a junkie and a
drug dealer most of his life,


616
0:27:49,93 --> 0:27:54,18
and a burglar, and in
and out of jail.


617
0:27:54,18 --> 0:27:57,288
He's not selling drugs at the
moment or committing crime,


618
0:27:57,288 --> 0:28:1,112
but he's still using drugs.


619
0:28:1,112 --> 0:28:2,68
SEAN COLLINS: Please
don't litter or


620
0:28:2,68 --> 0:28:3,98
urinate on the stairs.


621
0:28:3,98 --> 0:28:7,66
They want to put with that "or
use needles." That's for them


622
0:28:7,66 --> 0:28:11,98
to have a boot, smoke the heroin
on the foil That's


623
0:28:11,98 --> 0:28:13,975
probably two days,
between three.


624
0:28:13,975 --> 0:28:16,425
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): So how
many do you drink a day?


625
0:28:16,425 --> 0:28:22,533
SEAN COLLINS: About 12 each.


626
0:28:22,533 --> 0:28:26,826
About 12 each, yeah.


627
0:28:26,826 --> 0:28:27,78
Come on.


628
0:28:27,78 --> 0:28:30,988
Come on, Celine.


629
0:28:30,988 --> 0:28:32,329
LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): No,
you can't have a joint.


630
0:28:32,329 --> 0:28:33,23
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Of course we can.


631
0:28:33,23 --> 0:28:35,3
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, you can.


632
0:28:35,3 --> 0:28:36,3
LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN):
Where's my can, then?


633
0:28:36,3 --> 0:28:37,53
Hang on, let me have a can.


634
0:28:37,53 --> 0:28:40,99



635
0:28:40,99 --> 0:28:42,985
CARLO: Can you just get one
between me and you?


636
0:28:42,985 --> 0:28:43,41
LIBBY COLLINS: Why?


637
0:28:43,41 --> 0:28:44,98
Dad.


638
0:28:44,98 --> 0:28:45,293
SEAN COLLINS (OFFSCREEN):
I put it on top of


639
0:28:45,293 --> 0:28:47,876
there, right by you.


640
0:28:47,876 --> 0:28:49,65
LIBBY COLLINS: Four cans, Dad!


641
0:28:49,65 --> 0:28:50,46
CORNELIUS COLLINS:
Yeah, no, it is.


642
0:28:50,46 --> 0:28:53,208
Sorry, I've picked yours up.


643
0:28:53,208 --> 0:28:54,97
LIBBY COLLINS: Dad, come here.


644
0:28:54,97 --> 0:28:58,245
Dad, just come here a sec.


645
0:28:58,245 --> 0:28:59,41
It's in your hand.


646
0:28:59,41 --> 0:28:59,57
SEAN COLLINS: It's not.


647
0:28:59,57 --> 0:29:0,821
I just opened it.


648
0:29:0,821 --> 0:29:2,175
LIBBY COLLINS: Yeah, and you've
got one in the fridge.


649
0:29:2,175 --> 0:29:2,57
Come here.


650
0:29:2,57 --> 0:29:3,28
SEAN COLLINS: No, I haven't.


651
0:29:3,28 --> 0:29:3,97
LIBBY COLLINS: Yes, you have.


652
0:29:3,97 --> 0:29:5,85
That one in the fridge
is yours, Daddy.


653
0:29:5,85 --> 0:29:7,99
CORNELIUS COLLINS: That's Carlo,
my sister's boyfriend.


654
0:29:7,99 --> 0:29:9,92
This is my sister, Libby.


655
0:29:9,92 --> 0:29:10,62
LIBBY COLLINS: Hi.


656
0:29:10,62 --> 0:29:12,56
CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN):
My old man, Sean.


657
0:29:12,56 --> 0:29:14,0
Dad's mate, Darren.


658
0:29:14,0 --> 0:29:15,98
And my missus, Amy, who
you've met already.


659
0:29:15,98 --> 0:29:18,67
CARLO: Well, I've known her for
years, but we recently got


660
0:29:18,67 --> 0:29:19,87
to meet on the streets, yeah?


661
0:29:19,87 --> 0:29:21,48
LIBBY COLLINS: Yeah, we
met drinking in town.


662
0:29:21,48 --> 0:29:21,88
CARLO: In town.


663
0:29:21,88 --> 0:29:22,68
Drinking in town.


664
0:29:22,68 --> 0:29:23,713
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN):
In the last four years,


665
0:29:23,713 --> 0:29:25,646
everyone's said there's been a
lot more heroin in Swansea.


666
0:29:25,646 --> 0:29:26,96
Is that true?


667
0:29:26,96 --> 0:29:27,923
LIBBY COLLINS: Oh, yeah.


668
0:29:27,923 --> 0:29:28,69
SEAN COLLINS: Lots of it.


669
0:29:28,69 --> 0:29:30,26
You've got to go back
from the '60s.


670
0:29:30,26 --> 0:29:33,52
You've got to take it from
the '60s, really.


671
0:29:33,52 --> 0:29:37,28
You could do chemists,
and it'd be amazing.


672
0:29:37,28 --> 0:29:37,87
You know, it's be wooden--


673
0:29:37,87 --> 0:29:38,765
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Morphine and--


674
0:29:38,765 --> 0:29:39,675
SEAN COLLINS: Shut up.


675
0:29:39,675 --> 0:29:40,13
Shh.


676
0:29:40,13 --> 0:29:40,585
Shut up.


677
0:29:40,585 --> 0:29:41,77
LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN):
People of these days, they're


678
0:29:41,77 --> 0:29:42,22
just growing up--


679
0:29:42,22 --> 0:29:42,891
CARLO (OFFSCREEN): They're
growing up around it.


680
0:29:42,891 --> 0:29:43,43
Yeah.


681
0:29:43,43 --> 0:29:44,6
LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN):
Everybody's doing gear,


682
0:29:44,6 --> 0:29:46,93
because everybody's doing it.


683
0:29:46,93 --> 0:29:50,1
You know, people just don't care
now, because their mother


684
0:29:50,1 --> 0:29:51,2
or their father or their
brother or their


685
0:29:51,2 --> 0:29:51,72
cousin is doing it.


686
0:29:51,72 --> 0:29:51,98
They're all doing it.


687
0:29:51,98 --> 0:29:54,33
SEAN COLLINS: It don't make no
difference about your mother


688
0:29:54,33 --> 0:29:55,105
or your father--


689
0:29:55,105 --> 0:29:55,41
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Of course it do.


690
0:29:55,41 --> 0:29:56,856
SEAN COLLINS: It's about you.


691
0:29:56,856 --> 0:29:57,82
It's about you.


692
0:29:57,82 --> 0:29:58,82
It's your brain.


693
0:29:58,82 --> 0:29:59,58
LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN):
Look at kids now.


694
0:29:59,58 --> 0:30:1,15
10, 20 years ago, it
was different.


695
0:30:1,15 --> 0:30:2,852
Look at them now.


696
0:30:2,852 --> 0:30:4,304
SEAN COLLINS: And yet my--


697
0:30:4,304 --> 0:30:7,13
LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN):
[INAUDIBLE]


698
0:30:7,13 --> 0:30:8,62
No, hang on.


699
0:30:8,62 --> 0:30:10,42
I'm not saying it's the parents'
responsibility.


700
0:30:10,42 --> 0:30:13,443
What I'm saying is, if you're
round people doing it.


701
0:30:13,443 --> 0:30:15,25
If your mother and your father,
your aunt and your


702
0:30:15,25 --> 0:30:17,74
uncle, or anybody that's around
you 24/7 is on heroin,


703
0:30:17,74 --> 0:30:19,0
obviously, you're going
to take it.


704
0:30:19,0 --> 0:30:21,63
I'm not blaming you
or Mammy, Dad.


705
0:30:21,63 --> 0:30:24,825
I'm just saying, I got sucked
into the wrong circle.


706
0:30:24,825 --> 0:30:26,5
DARREN: [INAUDIBLE].


707
0:30:26,5 --> 0:30:27,37
SEAN COLLINS: Right.


708
0:30:27,37 --> 0:30:28,49
Hang on, now.


709
0:30:28,49 --> 0:30:31,3
How did you get sucked
into it?


710
0:30:31,3 --> 0:30:32,3
I never used in front of you.


711
0:30:32,3 --> 0:30:34,42
Your mother never used
in front of you.


712
0:30:34,42 --> 0:30:35,0
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Right.


713
0:30:35,0 --> 0:30:37,3
As a kid, I did catch you dosed
up on the toilet with


714
0:30:37,3 --> 0:30:37,77
the works in your arms.


715
0:30:37,77 --> 0:30:38,595
Shit like that.


716
0:30:38,595 --> 0:30:38,98
Yeah?


717
0:30:38,98 --> 0:30:39,38
SEAN COLLINS: Yeah.


718
0:30:39,38 --> 0:30:40,11
CORNELIUS COLLINS:
Right, started


719
0:30:40,11 --> 0:30:41,36
smoking fags and drinking.


720
0:30:41,36 --> 0:30:42,865
Then I went to smoking dope.


721
0:30:42,865 --> 0:30:44,81
Then I went to smoking
dope with you.


722
0:30:44,81 --> 0:30:47,43
Seeing you smoking dope once
I'd started smoking dope.


723
0:30:47,43 --> 0:30:48,56
But that's part of
it, isn't it?


724
0:30:48,56 --> 0:30:50,73
Drink and drugs.


725
0:30:50,73 --> 0:30:52,1
That's the circle you're in.


726
0:30:52,1 --> 0:30:54,6
LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): He
shouldn't have been should he?


727
0:30:54,6 --> 0:30:55,19
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Not now,
I've got an abscess.


728
0:30:55,19 --> 0:30:56,5
SEAN COLLINS: I know.


729
0:30:56,5 --> 0:31:0,5
I've never laid a
finger on him.


730
0:31:0,5 --> 0:31:2,66
I think once I hit
you, didn't I?


731
0:31:2,66 --> 0:31:3,298
One time.


732
0:31:3,298 --> 0:31:4,134
LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN):
Don't get into this now.


733
0:31:4,134 --> 0:31:4,552
Speak to these questions.


734
0:31:4,552 --> 0:31:5,99
SEAN COLLINS: And that
was in another house.


735
0:31:5,99 --> 0:31:7,94
AMY PROTHEROE: How long was
you homeless for, Carlo?


736
0:31:7,94 --> 0:31:8,97
CARLO: I'm lucky
at the moment.


737
0:31:8,97 --> 0:31:10,934
I've got a girlfriend with
a flat at the moment.


738
0:31:10,934 --> 0:31:15,41
So god knows what's gonna happen
if she kicks me out.


739
0:31:15,41 --> 0:31:17,9
LIBBY COLLINS: Well, if you were
a bit nicer, you wouldn't


740
0:31:17,9 --> 0:31:19,11
be worrying, would you, love?


741
0:31:19,11 --> 0:31:20,54
CORNELIUS COLLINS: How many
times have you been into detox


742
0:31:20,54 --> 0:31:22,25
and rehab and whatever?


743
0:31:22,25 --> 0:31:23,74
SEAN COLLINS: Detox.


744
0:31:23,74 --> 0:31:26,94
I've been to detox about--


745
0:31:26,94 --> 0:31:27,7
CORNELIUS COLLINS:
10, 12 times?


746
0:31:27,7 --> 0:31:29,14
SEAN COLLINS: 10, 12 times.


747
0:31:29,14 --> 0:31:30,81
I didn't stay that long.


748
0:31:30,81 --> 0:31:33,26
CORNELIUS COLLINS: My mother
and father split up--


749
0:31:33,26 --> 0:31:34,47
AMY PROTHEROE: Ask if his
mother got clean.


750
0:31:34,47 --> 0:31:35,37
CORNELIUS COLLINS: When I 13.


751
0:31:35,37 --> 0:31:37,4
My mother got clean.


752
0:31:37,4 --> 0:31:38,877
I stayed with Dad.


753
0:31:38,877 --> 0:31:39,731
[INAUDIBLE].


754
0:31:39,731 --> 0:31:41,24
SEAN COLLINS: Not my
fault, I said.


755
0:31:41,24 --> 0:31:42,7
Look at her, sticking
her oar in.


756
0:31:42,7 --> 0:31:45,385
CORNELIUS COLLINS: In and out
of detox, rehab, whatever.


757
0:31:45,385 --> 0:31:46,435
LIBBY COLLINS (OFFSCREEN): Mammy
and Daddy fought fucking


758
0:31:46,435 --> 0:31:46,77
and got clean for 8 weeks.


759
0:31:46,77 --> 0:31:47,85
SEAN COLLINS: It'll be
like Jeremy Kyle now.


760
0:31:47,85 --> 0:31:48,486
CORNELIUS COLLINS:
I just pissed a


761
0:31:48,486 --> 0:31:49,6
whole day on that one.


762
0:31:49,6 --> 0:31:50,23
SEAN COLLINS: Let me tell
you something now.


763
0:31:50,23 --> 0:31:51,4
She's one bitch.


764
0:31:51,4 --> 0:31:53,22
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Ah, Dad,
give it up now, will you?


765
0:31:53,22 --> 0:31:54,75
Don't speak about
her like that.


766
0:31:54,75 --> 0:31:55,2
It's not nice.


767
0:31:55,2 --> 0:31:56,92
SEAN COLLINS: All right,
she's not a bitch.


768
0:31:56,92 --> 0:32:0,54
I didn't mean to insult
dogs, sorry.


769
0:32:0,54 --> 0:32:1,93
AMY PROTHEROE: It's
a long story.


770
0:32:1,93 --> 0:32:2,57
SEAN COLLINS: No, it's not.


771
0:32:2,57 --> 0:32:3,83
It's a short story.


772
0:32:3,83 --> 0:32:9,934
If I have a minute with my son,

0:41:39,34 --> 0:41:43,42
If you don't get on, well, you
can't make it, can you?


965
0:41:43,42 --> 0:41:48,141
I say there's enough room in
the world for everybody, as


966
0:41:48,141 --> 0:41:50,89
long as somebody gives
some space.


967
0:41:50,89 --> 0:41:51,81
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Hey, hey.


968
0:41:51,81 --> 0:41:53,6
What's happening, boys?


969
0:41:53,6 --> 0:41:55,62



970
0:41:55,62 --> 0:41:57,69
Oh, a lot of old bill
about, isn't it?


971
0:41:57,69 --> 0:41:59,995
Fucking filth everywhere, man.


972
0:41:59,995 --> 0:42:0,53
Oh, they're doing a--


973
0:42:0,53 --> 0:42:1,78
There's my old man, look!


974
0:42:1,78 --> 0:42:2,704
AMY PROTHEROE: There he is.


975
0:42:2,704 --> 0:42:3,628
That's his--


976
0:42:3,628 --> 0:42:4,37
CORNELIUS COLLINS:
Mr. Collins.


977
0:42:4,37 --> 0:42:5,57
SEAN COLLINS: How's it going?


978
0:42:5,57 --> 0:42:6,42
All right?


979
0:42:6,42 --> 0:42:7,5
How's things?


980
0:42:7,5 --> 0:42:8,13
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Remember
this one, do ya?


981
0:42:8,13 --> 0:42:9,6
SEAN COLLINS: Where's the bin?


982
0:42:9,6 --> 0:42:11,58
CORNELIUS COLLINS: You
all right, man?


983
0:42:11,58 --> 0:42:12,56
Yeah?


984
0:42:12,56 --> 0:42:15,575
SEAN COLLINS: Well, I went to
that BNP thing, and I thought,


985
0:42:15,575 --> 0:42:17,85
well, it's a load of fucking--


986
0:42:17,85 --> 0:42:19,6
what's going on?


987
0:42:19,6 --> 0:42:24,9
But we do need the jobs
for our boys.


988
0:42:24,9 --> 0:42:26,64
And most of them are
illegal immigrants.


989
0:42:26,64 --> 0:42:30,924
There's no black on
the Union Jack.


990
0:42:30,924 --> 0:42:33,304
There is no white on the
Stars and Stripes.


991
0:42:33,304 --> 0:42:34,732
AMY PROTHEROE: [INAUDIBLE].


992
0:42:34,732 --> 0:42:36,21
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Oy, it'd be
nice if we was working again,


993
0:42:36,21 --> 0:42:37,3
Dad, wouldn't it?


994
0:42:37,3 --> 0:42:37,686
SEAN COLLINS: Yeah.


995
0:42:37,686 --> 0:42:39,54
Get him off the drugs.


996
0:42:39,54 --> 0:42:41,31
AMY PROTHEROE: Oh, look what he
bought me for my birthday.


997
0:42:41,31 --> 0:42:42,8
CORNELIUS COLLINS: I'm trying
to get back on The


998
0:42:42,8 --> 0:42:42,77
Big Issue, I am.


999
0:42:42,77 --> 0:42:44,35
SEAN COLLINS: I don't want
them two to get married.


1000
0:42:44,35 --> 0:42:45,33
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Why?


1001
0:42:45,33 --> 0:42:46,39
SEAN COLLINS: Would you?


1002
0:42:46,39 --> 0:42:47,9
Too many--


1003
0:42:47,9 --> 0:42:47,83
CORNELIUS COLLINS:
We're in love.


1004
0:42:47,83 --> 0:42:48,79
SEAN COLLINS: Yeah, right.


1005
0:42:48,79 --> 0:42:49,56
CORNELIUS COLLINS:
We're in love.


1006
0:42:49,56 --> 0:42:50,78
SEAN COLLINS: I really
don't want my son


1007
0:42:50,78 --> 0:42:51,81
to marry this girl.


1008
0:42:51,81 --> 0:42:53,814
CORNELIUS COLLINS:
Come on, then.


1009
0:42:53,814 --> 0:42:56,31
SEAN COLLINS: She drags
him down, man.


1010
0:42:56,31 --> 0:42:59,16
Since he's been with
her, it's like he's


1011
0:42:59,16 --> 0:43:0,712
gone into the gutter.


1012
0:43:0,712 --> 0:43:2,676
She drags him down, man.


1013
0:43:2,676 --> 0:43:4,149
I don't know why he loves her.


1014
0:43:4,149 --> 0:43:5,622
Love is blind, so they say.


1015
0:43:5,622 --> 0:43:7,95
I don't know.


1016
0:43:7,95 --> 0:43:8,58
And it's a sad thing.


1017
0:43:8,58 --> 0:43:11,42
I'm really sorry
for my son now.


1018
0:43:11,42 --> 0:43:14,98
I'm sorry for her, for
what happened-- what


1019
0:43:14,98 --> 0:43:15,803
she said, you know?


1020
0:43:15,803 --> 0:43:17,751
That she was abused and that.


1021
0:43:17,751 --> 0:43:19,212
AMY PROTHEROE: He's not
just my boyfriend.


1022
0:43:19,212 --> 0:43:21,647
He's my soulmate, my best
friend, and he's


1023
0:43:21,647 --> 0:43:22,621
the love of my life.


1024
0:43:22,621 --> 0:43:24,3
SEAN COLLINS: I loves him.


1025
0:43:24,3 --> 0:43:25,54
He loves me.


1026
0:43:25,54 --> 0:43:26,52
I loves him.


1027
0:43:26,52 --> 0:43:27,1
He loves me.


1028
0:43:27,1 --> 0:43:27,5
AMY PROTHEROE: I
loves him, too.


1029
0:43:27,5 --> 0:43:31,81
Sean, why don't we
get on, darling?


1030
0:43:31,81 --> 0:43:32,97
SEAN COLLINS: What
do you reckon?


1031
0:43:32,97 --> 0:43:33,82
AMY PROTHEROE: We
do and we don't.


1032
0:43:33,82 --> 0:43:34,946
SEAN COLLINS: You're
a bitch, man.


1033
0:43:34,946 --> 0:43:36,51
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Shut
it, you, you cunt.


1034
0:43:36,51 --> 0:43:38,0
SEAN COLLINS: Well,
you asked me why.


1035
0:43:38,0 --> 0:43:38,885
I'm telling the truth.


1036
0:43:38,885 --> 0:43:39,95
You are a bitch.


1037
0:43:39,95 --> 0:43:40,86
Eh?


1038
0:43:40,86 --> 0:43:43,6
You are a bitch, you know.


1039
0:43:43,6 --> 0:43:43,95
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): He
pulled your hair out?


1040
0:43:43,95 --> 0:43:44,435
AMY PROTHEROE: Yeah.


1041
0:43:44,435 --> 0:43:46,1
And he smashed the phone up.


1042
0:43:46,1 --> 0:43:46,82
SEAN COLLINS (OFFSREEN):
I did, yes.


1043
0:43:46,82 --> 0:43:49,12
I shouldn't have, but I did.


1044
0:43:49,12 --> 0:43:50,4
I am very sorry.


1045
0:43:50,4 --> 0:43:51,67
You know that, don't you?


1046
0:43:51,67 --> 0:43:54,11
CORNELIUS COLLINS:
The Collins clan.


1047
0:43:54,11 --> 0:43:55,36
The Collins clan.


1048
0:43:55,36 --> 0:43:59,58



1049
0:43:59,58 --> 0:44:1,93
CLINT RYAN JONES: Hello.


1050
0:44:1,93 --> 0:44:2,7
How are you?


1051
0:44:2,7 --> 0:44:3,16
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN):
How are you?


1052
0:44:3,16 --> 0:44:4,9
CLINT RYAN JONES: All
right, thank you.


1053
0:44:4,9 --> 0:44:5,18
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN):
Good to see you.


1054
0:44:5,18 --> 0:44:5,68
CLINT RYAN JONES:
I've cleaned up.


1055
0:44:5,68 --> 0:44:6,35
I'm clean.


1056
0:44:6,35 --> 0:44:6,7
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN):
You are?


1057
0:44:6,7 --> 0:44:8,38
CLINT RYAN JONES:
Yeah, I'm clean.


1058
0:44:8,38 --> 0:44:11,34
I've sorted my head out since
the last time you've seen me.


1059
0:44:11,34 --> 0:44:13,5
I went on a detox.


1060
0:44:13,5 --> 0:44:15,21
And then, that didn't
work for me.


1061
0:44:15,21 --> 0:44:17,18
I relapsed.


1062
0:44:17,18 --> 0:44:19,605
And then they put me on
a methadone program.


1063
0:44:19,605 --> 0:44:24,79



1064
0:44:24,79 --> 0:44:25,89
Ah, that's better, isn't it?


1065
0:44:25,89 --> 0:44:28,39
I've come a long way since you
last seen me, you know?


1066
0:44:28,39 --> 0:44:29,61
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.


1067
0:44:29,61 --> 0:44:30,58
CLINT RYAN JONES: It's nice to
see you fellows, anyway.


1068
0:44:30,58 --> 0:44:30,88
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.


1069
0:44:30,88 --> 0:44:31,87
You too, man.


1070
0:44:31,87 --> 0:44:33,1
You too.


1071
0:44:33,1 --> 0:44:33,94
Positive mental attitude.


1072
0:44:33,94 --> 0:44:34,39
CLINT RYAN JONES: Yeah.


1073
0:44:34,39 --> 0:44:34,955
PMA.


1074
0:44:34,955 --> 0:44:35,956
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.


1075
0:44:35,956 --> 0:44:38,55
CLINT RYAN JONES:
It does work.


1076
0:44:38,55 --> 0:44:39,5
CLINT RYAN JONES (OFFSCREEN):
I've really


1077
0:44:39,5 --> 0:44:40,35
improved and things.


1078
0:44:40,35 --> 0:44:41,79
I'm much happier.


1079
0:44:41,79 --> 0:44:47,7
Like, I want to go back to
college and study social--


1080
0:44:47,7 --> 0:44:49,63



1081
0:44:49,63 --> 0:44:51,41
is it care?


1082
0:44:51,41 --> 0:44:55,15
I'm saving up now for my
daughter, for when I get to


1083
0:44:55,15 --> 0:44:58,62
see her, to give her a load
of presents and things.


1084
0:44:58,62 --> 0:45:1,8



1085
0:45:1,8 --> 0:45:5,2
Because I don't want to be
dependent on methadone.


1086
0:45:5,2 --> 0:45:5,84
No, no way.


1087
0:45:5,84 --> 0:45:8,16
Liquid handcuffs,
they call it.


1088
0:45:8,16 --> 0:45:10,9
That's what they call it--
liquid handcuffs, because


1089
0:45:10,9 --> 0:45:15,33
you've got to stay in the area
to take that liquid every day


1090
0:45:15,33 --> 0:45:17,7
to stop you from being ill.


1091
0:45:17,7 --> 0:45:17,78
It's impossible.


1092
0:45:17,78 --> 0:45:20,4
It's every other door around
here is selling it.


1093
0:45:20,4 --> 0:45:22,76
Or if they haven't got it, you
know, it's only down around


1094
0:45:22,76 --> 0:45:23,88
the corner have got it.


1095
0:45:23,88 --> 0:45:25,85
You know, it's easy to get
a hold of-- so easy


1096
0:45:25,85 --> 0:45:26,905
to get a hold of.


1097
0:45:26,905 --> 0:45:27,36
It is.


1098
0:45:27,36 --> 0:45:28,46
It's getting really worse.


1099
0:45:28,46 --> 0:45:29,59
It's getting terrible.


1100
0:45:29,59 --> 0:45:30,6
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): Why?


1101
0:45:30,6 --> 0:45:31,254
Because of the demand?


1102
0:45:31,254 --> 0:45:32,56
CLINT RYAN JONES: Well, It's
not so much as that.


1103
0:45:32,56 --> 0:45:36,27
It's the money that's being
made off it, you know?


1104
0:45:36,27 --> 0:45:38,61
People are making thousands
upon thousands


1105
0:45:38,61 --> 0:45:40,12
of pounds off it.


1106
0:45:40,12 --> 0:45:42,37
I'm ashamed to say I
used to sell it.


1107
0:45:42,37 --> 0:45:46,45
I used to make, easy,
1,500 pounds a day.


1108
0:45:46,45 --> 0:45:49,68
And I'd still be living
like a scruff.


1109
0:45:49,68 --> 0:45:51,93
I'd do a snowball,
as they call it--


1110
0:45:51,93 --> 0:45:55,67
mix heroin with crack and
have one hell of a


1111
0:45:55,67 --> 0:45:57,25
fantastic head on.


1112
0:45:57,25 --> 0:46:1,71
But you've still got to wake
up to the same shit the


1113
0:46:1,71 --> 0:46:3,65
following day, you know?


1114
0:46:3,65 --> 0:46:5,53
I've turned my life around
now, and I've


1115
0:46:5,53 --> 0:46:6,12
sorted myself out.


1116
0:46:6,12 --> 0:46:10,38
And I wouldn't dare touch
another bag of it in my life.


1117
0:46:10,38 --> 0:46:33,45



1118
0:46:33,45 --> 0:46:34,27
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Hey, cat.


1119
0:46:34,27 --> 0:46:35,41
Guess what we done yesterday?


1120
0:46:35,41 --> 0:46:36,55
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): What
happened yesterday?


1121
0:46:36,55 --> 0:46:37,97
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Lost
our fucking money.


1122
0:46:37,97 --> 0:46:39,37
Amy gets paid on a Wednesday.


1123
0:46:39,37 --> 0:46:40,62
I get paid on Thursday.


1124
0:46:40,62 --> 0:46:44,8



1125
0:46:44,8 --> 0:46:44,62
She's coming.


1126
0:46:44,62 --> 0:46:45,27
Said she had the car.


1127
0:46:45,27 --> 0:46:45,81
There she is.


1128
0:46:45,81 --> 0:46:48,56
There she is.


1129
0:46:48,56 --> 0:46:49,81
She's crying.


1130
0:46:49,81 --> 0:46:53,582



1131
0:46:53,582 --> 0:46:57,18
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Amy, would
you be nice and not hit me?


1132
0:46:57,18 --> 0:46:58,66
AMY PROTHEROE: [INAUDIBLE].


1133
0:46:58,66 --> 0:47:0,73
You poured cider all
over my hair, man.


1134
0:47:0,73 --> 0:47:1,81
CORNELIUS COLLINS: What?


1135
0:47:1,81 --> 0:47:2,57
Why?


1136
0:47:2,57 --> 0:47:3,46
Amy, why?


1137
0:47:3,46 --> 0:47:4,34
Because you fucking--


1138
0:47:4,34 --> 0:47:5,322
AMY PROTHEROE: You
fucked my mother.


1139
0:47:5,322 --> 0:47:7,286
CORNELIUS COLLINS: I didn't
fuck your mother.


1140
0:47:7,286 --> 0:47:7,777
Amy.


1141
0:47:7,777 --> 0:47:8,759
AMY PROTHEROE: I'm homeless.


1142
0:47:8,759 --> 0:47:11,214
[INAUDIBLE].


1143
0:47:11,214 --> 0:47:12,196
Look what you've done.


1144
0:47:12,196 --> 0:47:13,178
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Look
what I've done.


1145
0:47:13,178 --> 0:47:13,669
Hold on.


1146
0:47:13,669 --> 0:47:14,16
Right, Amy?


1147
0:47:14,16 --> 0:47:17,155
It's either do that, right,
or hit you back?


1148
0:47:17,155 --> 0:47:18,45
What do you want me to do?


1149
0:47:18,45 --> 0:47:19,12
Do you want a punch?


1150
0:47:19,12 --> 0:47:21,8
Or do you want a fucking
dribble of


1151
0:47:21,8 --> 0:47:22,78
cider chucked at you?


1152
0:47:22,78 --> 0:47:24,35
I'm not having it, Amy.


1153
0:47:24,35 --> 0:47:29,648
Amy, your mother and Fogey
yesterday, right, told me and


1154
0:47:29,648 --> 0:47:31,988
you you're lucky I haven't
fucking hit you.


1155
0:47:31,988 --> 0:47:32,924
That's what they said.


1156
0:47:32,924 --> 0:47:34,796
You're lucky you haven't
had a fucking hiding.


1157
0:47:34,796 --> 0:47:36,4
Do you know if you weren't
my girlfriend--


1158
0:47:36,4 --> 0:47:37,32
AMY PROTHEROE: You
fucked my mother.


1159
0:47:37,32 --> 0:47:38,69
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Amy,
fuck off, right?


1160
0:47:38,69 --> 0:47:39,997
AMY PROTHEROE: He's always
abandoning me.


1161
0:47:39,997 --> 0:47:41,865
I've fucked my own mother.


1162
0:47:41,865 --> 0:47:43,266
Her lips are long, man.


1163
0:47:43,266 --> 0:47:44,667
Don't they sag down a bit?


1164
0:47:44,667 --> 0:47:45,45
CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSCREEN):
I know you've fucked your own


1165
0:47:45,45 --> 0:47:46,1
mother, Amy.


1166
0:47:46,1 --> 0:47:47,45
You've told me, man.


1167
0:47:47,45 --> 0:47:50,93
AMY PROTHEROE: Don't they
sag down a bit?


1168
0:47:50,93 --> 0:47:51,64
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Fuck off.


1169
0:47:51,64 --> 0:47:55,41
You knows I wouldn't
shag your mother.


1170
0:47:55,41 --> 0:47:57,62
Would you risk shagging your
girlfriend's mother when your


1171
0:47:57,62 --> 0:47:59,85
girlfriend's on the settee,
you're out in the kitchen


1172
0:47:59,85 --> 0:48:2,24
looking for cider with your
girlfriend's mother.


1173
0:48:2,24 --> 0:48:3,12
And her boyfriend--


1174
0:48:3,12 --> 0:48:5,74
no, her mother's boyfriend--
is upstairs, who's fucking


1175
0:48:5,74 --> 0:48:7,88
loopy, who's been to jail for
kidnapping and smashing


1176
0:48:7,88 --> 0:48:9,31
people's toes off.


1177
0:48:9,31 --> 0:48:12,21
And he's fucking psycho
to the max.


1178
0:48:12,21 --> 0:48:13,57
Would you risk shagging
his missus


1179
0:48:13,57 --> 0:48:15,69
downstairs while he's upstairs?


1180
0:48:15,69 --> 0:48:16,2
Would you?


1181
0:48:16,2 --> 0:48:17,6
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN):
I wouldn't.


1182
0:48:17,6 --> 0:48:17,955
CORNELIUS COLLINS:
Would you, Adam?


1183
0:48:17,955 --> 0:48:18,39
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN):
Mm-mm.


1184
0:48:18,39 --> 0:48:18,81
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Would do?


1185
0:48:18,81 --> 0:48:19,27
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN): No.


1186
0:48:19,27 --> 0:48:20,195
CORNELIUS COLLINS:
So fuck you.


1187
0:48:20,195 --> 0:48:21,83
I wouldn't neither.


1188
0:48:21,83 --> 0:48:22,66
You knows I don't
like violence.


1189
0:48:22,66 --> 0:48:23,91
You knows I don't
like fighting.


1190
0:48:23,91 --> 0:48:28,492
So am I gonna risk having
my fucking hand


1191
0:48:28,492 --> 0:48:30,404
chopped off with an axe?


1192
0:48:30,404 --> 0:48:31,36
AMY PROTHEROE: [INAUDIBLE].


1193
0:48:31,36 --> 0:48:32,794
CORNELIUS COLLINS:
Not my problem.


1194
0:48:32,794 --> 0:48:34,83
I'll give you one glass
and that's it.


1195
0:48:34,83 --> 0:48:36,59
I'm not having you take
a piss ut of me.


1196
0:48:36,59 --> 0:48:38,544
Telling me I shagged your
fucking mother.


1197
0:48:38,544 --> 0:48:39,512
How are you so insecure?


1198
0:48:39,512 --> 0:48:41,932
AMY PROTHEROE: Corneil, I paid
the money [INAUDIBLE].


1199
0:48:41,932 --> 0:48:44,46
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Why don't
you go do a punter?


1200
0:48:44,46 --> 0:48:45,6
Quicker than begging,
isn't it?


1201
0:48:45,6 --> 0:48:46,49
AMY PROTHEROE: I had
to beg for the 17


1202
0:48:46,49 --> 0:48:48,58
pounds my mother robbed.


1203
0:48:48,58 --> 0:48:49,938
And I'm only allowed
to have one.


1204
0:48:49,938 --> 0:48:51,282
Can I have the cider?


1205
0:48:51,282 --> 0:48:53,58
It's just gonna make me ill.


1206
0:48:53,58 --> 0:48:54,912
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Fucking
fill your glass


1207
0:48:54,912 --> 0:48:55,875
up, and shut up.


1208
0:48:55,875 --> 0:48:56,85
You're being dopey.


1209
0:48:56,85 --> 0:48:57,62
AMY PROTHEROE: [INAUDIBLE].


1210
0:48:57,62 --> 0:48:58,799
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Oh, well
fuck off then, if


1211
0:48:58,799 --> 0:48:59,98
you're gonna go.


1212
0:48:59,98 --> 0:49:2,174
I just don't know why
you're being nasty.


1213
0:49:2,174 --> 0:49:3,95
AMY PROTHEROE: Fill
it up, will you?


1214
0:49:3,95 --> 0:49:4,64
Fuck's sake.


1215
0:49:4,64 --> 0:49:5,74
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Look at
the way you're talking.


1216
0:49:5,74 --> 0:49:6,9
Get off my-- hey.


1217
0:49:6,9 --> 0:49:8,52
Kick my glass on the floor.


1218
0:49:8,52 --> 0:49:10,92
Get all dirt all over it.


1219
0:49:10,92 --> 0:49:11,77
Thanks.


1220
0:49:11,77 --> 0:49:12,88
I'm in agony, right?


1221
0:49:12,88 --> 0:49:15,84
Yesterday, she punched me four
times in the bollocks.


1222
0:49:15,84 --> 0:49:18,46
And she's fucked my other--
she's fucked my only decent


1223
0:49:18,46 --> 0:49:19,1
bollock up.


1224
0:49:19,1 --> 0:49:23,625
One's fucked already from 11
years ago, as she knows, and


1225
0:49:23,625 --> 0:49:25,344
she's gonna fucking punch
me four times.


1226
0:49:25,344 --> 0:49:28,416
And I've got a pain in my
stomach at the moment.


1227
0:49:28,416 --> 0:49:30,264
My bollocks are fucking
killing.


1228
0:49:30,264 --> 0:49:31,65
AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN):
You're fucking lying.


1229
0:49:31,65 --> 0:49:32,924
CORNELIUS COLLINS: I'm lying?


1230
0:49:32,924 --> 0:49:33,358
Right.


1231
0:49:33,358 --> 0:49:35,96
Did you know I had a fucking
dodgy bollock, then?


1232
0:49:35,96 --> 0:49:36,28
AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN):
Yeah.


1233
0:49:36,28 --> 0:49:37,65
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Was is much
bigger than the other one?


1234
0:49:37,65 --> 0:49:38,94
AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN):
Don't know.


1235
0:49:38,94 --> 0:49:39,8
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Fuck off.


1236
0:49:39,8 --> 0:49:40,23
You don't know.


1237
0:49:40,23 --> 0:49:42,382
AMY PROTHEROE: Why can't
you give me some cider?


1238
0:49:42,382 --> 0:49:44,166
CORNELIUS COLLINS (OFFSREEN):
I just gave you a glass.


1239
0:49:44,166 --> 0:49:47,255
AMY PROTHEROE: I want you
to give me some more.


1240
0:49:47,255 --> 0:49:49,918
CORNELIUS COLLINS: All right,
[INAUDIBLE], huh?


1241
0:49:49,918 --> 0:49:51,854
Are you going to
knock it over?


1242
0:49:51,854 --> 0:49:53,104
AMY PROTHEROE: [INAUDIBLE].


1243
0:49:53,104 --> 0:49:55,15



1244
0:49:55,15 --> 0:49:56,16
CORNELIUS COLLINS
(OFFSREEN): Amy.


1245
0:49:56,16 --> 0:49:56,92
AMY PROTHEROE: [INAUDIBLE].


1246
0:49:56,92 --> 0:49:57,39
CORNELIUS COLLINS: What


1247
0:49:57,39 --> 0:49:58,4
AMY PROTHEROE (OFFSCREEN):
[INAUDIBLE]


1248
0:49:58,4 --> 0:50:1,134
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Oh, phwor.


1249
0:50:1,134 --> 0:50:2,384
Poor little Amy.


1250
0:50:2,384 --> 0:50:25,84



1251
0:50:25,84 --> 0:50:26,89
LEE DENNIS (OFFSCREEN): I feel
a lot better in myself.


1252
0:50:26,89 --> 0:50:29,11
I mean I've been clean
now a good few weeks.


1253
0:50:29,11 --> 0:50:31,27
There's a few boys on the
bikes by here, look.


1254
0:50:31,27 --> 0:50:37,517
[ENGINES REVVING]


1255
0:50:37,517 --> 0:50:38,71
LEE DENNIS (OFFSCREEN):
Little kids, eh?


1256
0:50:38,71 --> 0:50:41,26
Some mad times we used to
have up here as kids--


1257
0:50:41,26 --> 0:50:43,748
setting cars on fire.


1258
0:50:43,748 --> 0:50:46,12
Good boy.


1259
0:50:46,12 --> 0:50:48,88
The rabbits and the hares and
that-- many times we'd come up


1260
0:50:48,88 --> 0:50:50,76
here, early hours of the
morning, and you could see


1261
0:50:50,76 --> 0:50:52,0
eyes running everywhere.


1262
0:50:52,0 --> 0:50:53,9
We used to try to chasing them
in a stolen car and try


1263
0:50:53,9 --> 0:50:55,7
killing them and stuff
you know what I mean?


1264
0:50:55,7 --> 0:50:58,39
Off our face, drunk and stuff,
you know what I mean?


1265
0:50:58,39 --> 0:51:1,37
Many times, the farmer used to
come out with his rice gun and


1266
0:51:1,37 --> 0:51:3,45
shoot us with his rice--


1267
0:51:3,45 --> 0:51:4,72
rice cartridges.


1268
0:51:4,72 --> 0:51:7,22
And they used to sting like
hell, especially if they catch


1269
0:51:7,22 --> 0:51:8,68
you on the arse, like.


1270
0:51:8,68 --> 0:51:12,6
You know, I wish I'd stuck with
the old crowd, instead of


1271
0:51:12,6 --> 0:51:13,96
all the heroin users
and stuff.


1272
0:51:13,96 --> 0:51:17,8
Years ago, I could count a good
few friends on my hand.


1273
0:51:17,8 --> 0:51:19,77
But now, they disowned me, type
of thing, for the heroin.


1274
0:51:19,77 --> 0:51:24,165
If I'd known how bad heroin was,
I wouldn't have tried it.


1275
0:51:24,165 --> 0:51:25,43
It's a bad drug.


1276
0:51:25,43 --> 0:51:26,49
It' a dirty drug.


1277
0:51:26,49 --> 0:51:29,68
But it's a nice drug as well.


1278
0:51:29,68 --> 0:51:31,53
It's a nice feeling off it.


1279
0:51:31,53 --> 0:51:34,295
Now, I wake up in the morning, I
go down to get my methadone,


1280
0:51:34,295 --> 0:51:37,87
I drink my methadone, and I try
to keep myself occupied


1281
0:51:37,87 --> 0:51:40,98
then by going over to my
sister's or my mum's That I


1282
0:51:40,98 --> 0:51:42,135
made when I was in
prison before.


1283
0:51:42,135 --> 0:51:42,75
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN):
You did?


1284
0:51:42,75 --> 0:51:45,96
LEE DENNIS: Yeah, Gypsy caravan
out of matches.


1285
0:51:45,96 --> 0:51:46,98
Nodding head--


1286
0:51:46,98 --> 0:51:52,77
when I put my reggae on, his
head rocks back and forth.


1287
0:51:52,77 --> 0:51:54,44
Drug testing kit that I done


1288
0:51:54,44 --> 0:51:56,515
yesterday, which is a negative.


1289
0:51:56,515 --> 0:51:59,1
They test you for heroin
and crack cocaine.


1290
0:51:59,1 --> 0:52:0,8
And there's two lines--


1291
0:52:0,8 --> 0:52:1,21
negative.


1292
0:52:1,21 --> 0:52:4,83
Now I just want to be normal
now, try and get myself a


1293
0:52:4,83 --> 0:52:6,131
decent job.


1294
0:52:6,131 --> 0:52:7,258
INTERVIEWER (OFFSCREEN):
When you look back on


1295
0:52:7,258 --> 0:52:8,39
it, how do you feel?


1296
0:52:8,39 --> 0:52:9,36
LEE DENNIS: Tell you
the truth, man, I


1297
0:52:9,36 --> 0:52:11,13
think I'm an asshole.


1298
0:52:11,13 --> 0:52:14,15
Put my family through so
much shit and trouble.


1299
0:52:14,15 --> 0:52:16,787
Many a times, I said I've love
to move away and that, but


1300
0:52:16,787 --> 0:52:19,612
really, I won't.


1301
0:52:19,612 --> 0:52:20,38
I don't know.


1302
0:52:20,38 --> 0:52:22,84
It's my hometown, and all my
family are in Swansea.


1303
0:52:22,84 --> 0:52:26,3



1304
0:52:26,3 --> 0:52:27,35
I don't think I've
ever move away.


1305
0:52:27,35 --> 0:52:36,45



1306
0:52:36,45 --> 0:52:38,72
AMY PROTHEROE: If I didn't have
Corneil, I think I would


1307
0:52:38,72 --> 0:52:39,21
have killed myself by now.


1308
0:52:39,21 --> 0:52:39,963
He's what keeps me going.


1309
0:52:39,963 --> 0:52:41,847
You're my rock, aren't you?


1310
0:52:41,847 --> 0:52:43,731
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Oh, baby.


1311
0:52:43,731 --> 0:52:45,15
AMY PROTHEROE: He's my rock.


1312
0:52:45,15 --> 0:52:47,14
Well, we loves each other
to bits, don't we?


1313
0:52:47,14 --> 0:52:48,22
CORNELIUS COLLINS:
We do, yeah.


1314
0:52:48,22 --> 0:52:48,55
AMY PROTHEROE: Yeah.


1315
0:52:48,55 --> 0:52:50,3
CORNELIUS COLLINS: We
love each other.


1316
0:52:50,3 --> 0:52:50,49
AMY PROTHEROE: We're engaged.


1317
0:52:50,49 --> 0:52:52,27
He got me an engagement
ring for my


1318
0:52:52,27 --> 0:52:58,627
18th birthday, remember?


1319
0:52:58,627 --> 0:53:0,94
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Just found
a bottle of wine.


1320
0:53:0,94 --> 0:53:5,962



1321
0:53:5,962 --> 0:53:9,3
That is when I had Student of
the Year award in Swansea


1322
0:53:9,3 --> 0:53:14,275
College, Tychoch College, for
NVQ Level 1 business studies.


1323
0:53:14,275 --> 0:53:16,61
Or was it level 2?


1324
0:53:16,61 --> 0:53:17,29
I can't remember now.


1325
0:53:17,29 --> 0:53:18,615
Level 2, I think it was.


1326
0:53:18,615 --> 0:53:21,28
No, GNVQ Foundation Level 1.


1327
0:53:21,28 --> 0:53:23,28
And I look like I
got lipstick on.


1328
0:53:23,28 --> 0:53:25,3
AMY PROTHEROE: He done a
catering course, business


1329
0:53:25,3 --> 0:53:26,62
studies course.


1330
0:53:26,62 --> 0:53:27,695
CORNELIUS COLLINS:
What's that say?


1331
0:53:27,695 --> 0:53:28,53
AMY PROTHEROE: Have
you got fucking


1332
0:53:28,53 --> 0:53:30,23
lip balm on or something?


1333
0:53:30,23 --> 0:53:31,6
CORNELIUS COLLINS: Don't I look
like I got lipstick on?


1334
0:53:31,6 --> 0:53:34,51



1335
