###2 [MUSIC - EIGHT DAYZ, "WHAT'S SO STRANGE ABOUT ME?"]

###19 
###25 PONTUS ALV: In the '70s, Malmo was a big industrial city.
###28 And building big oil ships, like big tankers, that was the
###31 main business.
###33 In the '80s, there was the big financial crash.
###35 So there was no work, there was no
###37 jobs, there was nothing.
###39 Malmo had quite a big skate scene back
###41 then in the late '80s.
###43 That was when the big trend came from the States.
###46 When my parents got divorced and moved to another city,
###49 like a small village called [INAUDIBLE], that's where I
###52 started skating.
###53 Basically, my dad picked me up after school, drove me 45
###57 minutes to Malmo to go to the skate park, go to the spot.
###60 He would sit there all day, wait for me, watch
###63 me skate, go back.
###64 And we would do that every day,
###65 pretty much, after school.
###67 
###71 I always try to skate something different.
###72 I always try to make something different,
###74 find something different.
###76 For me, it's like the atmosphere around the spot is
###78 just as important as the spot itself.
###80 
###84 The first place we built was Savanna Side.
###88 This is where it all started.
###89 
###92 Well, it's right there.
###94 Used to be all empty here, just old factory foundation.
###99 
###101 When we built the park, we didn't have any plan for it.
###105 Everything is just kind of made up, just everybody got a
###108 little piece in here.
###109 
###112 We use to skate the trains as well sometimes, street gaps on
###116 top of the trains.
###117 
###124 This here, we skated here every day for two months,
###127 three months.
###129 
###131 People are not so into this place.
###132 Not many people come here to skate.
###134 This is the New York banks.
###136 If you don't have it, you got to build it.
###139 This is kind of like the spot in London.
###141 I know Bobby Puleo has a couple tricks, the nosegrind
###143 into these brick banks, kind of like the same idea.
###148 I mean, if you want to have something good to skate, you
###150 want to have something that is interesting, fun, you've got
###153 to build it.
###153 I mean, you don't find these kind of things on the streets.
###155 And here, I've got everything I need in one small place.
###159 And it's perfect, you know.
###160 
###163 We go skate.
###164 And I got the camera with me.
###165 And whatever happens happens.
###166 But we always end up having some photos, some footage.
###169 And then we just do something with it, you know.
###170 
###173 NILS SVENSSON: You have to be creative to find new
###176 stuff all the time.
###177 That's what's great with Pontus.
###178 That's exactly what he's looking for.
###180 And that's exactly what I'm looking for.
###183 "Strongest of the Strange," it's quite a slice of history
###187 from Malmo skating right there.
###189 You could see the development we've done with the DIY stuff.
###194 I think it was really inspiring for a lot of people
###197 that you can really create your own skate scene,
###200 basically, just by bricks and concrete.
###204 PONTUS ALV: I think a lot of people, it was really
###205 refreshing to see that video, with the whole DIY documentary
###209 thing inspired a lot of people.
###211 I got kids from all over Europe sending me emails like,
###214 hey, I love that video, I love what you did.
###217 And look what me and my friends built.
###219 
###225 There's so many bowls have been built just because of
###227 that little section in my video.
###228 
###235 This is what remains.
###237 There's a lot of history here in this place.
###239 It was quite famous when it was up and running.
###242 
###245 This place used to be fucking homeless city.
###248 We talked to the landowner when he kicked out all the
###250 homeless people here.
###251 They said, yeah, you guys can stay.
###253 But we've got to clean up the area.
###255 The homeless people here, they were so angry at me.
###258 They're like, yeah man, we've been living here for eight,
###259 nine years.
###260 And you guys get to stay.
###261 They kick us out.
###262 And yeah, they were throwing fire bombs over the
###265 fence into the bowl.
###267 This bowl has got destroyed a couple of times,
###269 and we fixed it.
###270 And one day came, someone smashed it.
###273 The first you get bulldozed, you get really bummed.
###276 But I'm so used to it now.
###278 In a way, it's good, because you get new stuff to
###280 skate all the time.
###282 Tear it down, and build another one.
###283 And tear it down, and build-- it's like a little war I got.
###287 If you have an idea, do it, and do it now.
###290 This session today might be the last one.
###292 It might be the last time we skate here together.
###295 That brings something extra to the spot, rather than just a
###298 public state park, that it's there for you.
###301 
###313 Back in the '90s, Malmo was a ghost town, kind of
###317 like worn down city.
###319 Skating-wise, wasn't anything going on.
###321 I mean, skateboarding in the '90s was dead.
###328 We used to skate here all the time.
###330 Then for some reason, they put this for the people that go
###333 from the bus, so it's not slippery.
###335 So they kind of fucked up the spot, because this ledge was
###339 the main thing to skate.
###340 
###346 MARTIN NILSSON: In the '90s there was this
###346 square right there.
###348 We called it Plaza.
###350 We had ledges.
###350 We had this.
###352 We had some stairs.
###353 I mean, it wasn't perfect, and nothing is.
###355 But it was our spot.
###357 And I wouldn't go as far as saying it
###359 was American standard.
###361 But in our heads, we were like, yeah, this is
###363 really a good spot.
###365 
###367 When we started, we were 10 or 15 guys.
###371 Pontus was 11.
###372 And one guy was, back then, 25.
###376 Everybody hated us.
###377 Story of most skaters' lives in the '90s.
###380 -Yes.
###381 
###383 MARTIN OTTOSSON: This was in the early '80s.
###386 There was a Swedish band called Magnum Bonum.
###388 
###392 They made a hit song called "Skateboard." I used to listen
###395 to it every day when I was playing on my swing.
###398 I moved here in '95.
###401 The official reason was for studies.
###404 But I wanted to go here because of skateboarding.
###407 It was only one group of people.
###409 It was us.
###410 We didn't have anybody else to look up to or learn from.
###415 MARTIN NILSSON: We probably spent skating
###417 three hours every day.
###418 When it was raining or too cold, we could just go down,
###423 because under here is a parking garage.
###426 
###431 When the shopping mall is closed, we could skate up
###433 here, the luxury part of the garage.
###437 And most of the time, we used to just skate down there,
###440 because otherwise we got kicked out.
###444 TOBIAS HENRIKSSON: We came down here
###445 first time maybe '91.
###448 We used to skate here a lot, every day from 7
###450 o'clock 'til 9:00.
###452 There are some other garages, but not as good as this.
###455 This is warm and perfect flat ground and curbs.
###458 Perfect to do manuals and stuff here.
###459 
###463 That's the way it was back then.
###464 We never turned the camera off.
###466 One guy missed, the next guy would jump in, do the line.
###469 
###473 Pontus, he's five years younger than the rest of us.
###476 I remember when he took off in '94, maybe, when he was
###480 getting really good.
###482 It was cool when he went to San Francisco and skated for
###485 Mad Circle, because Mad Circle was so big at that time.
###487 -Were you guys pretty proud of him?
###489 TOBIAS HENRIKSSON: Yes, we were.
###490 Still are.
###491 
###496 PONTUS ALV: [INAUDIBLE], and he's the one who started up
###500 Mad Circle with Justin.
###501 I met him at the skate park in Gothenburg.
###503 And he saw me skate.
###504 And he was really stoked.
###507 Basically, yeah, he got a camera from [INAUDIBLE].
###509 He came down one day.
###511 And I'm going to film you.
###512 And I was like, OK, cool.
###514 Because I was thinking you have to make
###516 everything first try.
###517 So I got, like, I don't know, 15 lines first try, like bam.
###522 And then he sent the tape to the States.
###525 Justin saw it, and he's like, this is it.
###527 Him and Blabec came over, we skated.
###529 And then they said, yeah, I'll fly you out to San Francisco,
###531 and it was on.
###533 I was, like, 15.
###535 My mom said, you got to bring a friend.
###538 So I brought one of my friends over.
###540 Justin picked us up.
###541 And we lost our luggage.
###542 Me and Scott Johnson didn't really get along that well.
###545 But me and Bobby were tight.
###547 Coming from this little town, just straight to fucking your
###550 dream company, like from nothing down here to going
###554 straight into the heart of San Francisco.
###557 
###562 This is the church.
###563 It's called Johannes Church.
###565 This is where I had a line in the "5 Flavors," opening
###569 switch 180 up, and backs a flip out.
###572 This was the main meet up spot.
###575 Back in those days, all you needed, like, flat curb and
###578 wax it up, and [SWISH].
###579 
###582 JOHN DAHLQUIST: We spent a lot of time here.
###584 Pretty much one full summer in '93, we'd meet up
###588 here, skate all day.
###591 Road trip would be to go down to that parking lot.
###594 
###601 PONTUS ALV: This parking lot used to be covered with these
###604 white ledges.
###605 We used to skate here a lot.
###607 This is for the good old days.
###608 
###618 In my second video, I had 50-50, and then transfer to
###623 the other side.
###624 
###627 Mad Circle ended.
###629 I got back to Europe, I wanted to quit skating.
###631 But then I just started to skate again with friends and
###633 got into it, and just called up Jeremy and said, I want to
###638 work with Cliche, and want to build something up in Europe.
###640 And me and Jeremy started working on the whole Cliche
###643 Europa project.
###644 
###648 It seems like since I left the industry, things have just
###650 been going so much better.
###652 The more you're away from skateboarding, the
###654 more people want you.
###655 Now it's like, oh, we want an interview.
###657 We want photos.
###658 We want to publish your stuff.
###659 When I was in the States, when I was with
###661 Cliche, you try so hard.
###663 And then it's like you're just another guy doing it.
###665 People always want something they can't get.
###667 
###681 -Do you like it?
###683 PONTUS ALV: It's all right.
###686 -Let me see.
###687 Let me see it.
###687 PONTUS ALV: Hello.
###688 -Go ahead.
###689 PONTUS ALV: Hello.
###690 -Yeah, that's good.
###691 PONTUS ALV: That's good?
###692 
###700 JEREMY BUTTERWORTH: Get, go, come here.
###702 That's right.
###703 
###706 Not quite used to all this hype around here.
###709 Cameras on, it's like, oh, how's my hair?
###711 
###714 My name's Jeremy Butterworth.
###715 I'm from Australia originally.
###717 I first came to Malmo in 2005.
###722 I had to help work on the Stapelbadd project.
###726 This one's being built here in Oxie because I think it's kind
###728 of a rough neighborhood, so they need something to do.
###731 And it's just another good excuse to get Malmo another
###734 skate park.
###734 It's only 20 minutes away.
###737 DAVID TOMS: I didn't really even know where Malmo was when
###740 I first got my job.
###741 Just turned up here and was blown away by the
###743 skateboarding that I saw and the DIY feel that was going on
###748 here with Pontus building spots everywhere.
###751 The government really, really encouraging of the scene.
###753 They're just a really positive towards the building of parks
###757 and the acquisition of money for the
###758 skaters to build parks.
###761 JEREMY BUTTERWORTH: We just came out here with a few
###763 things in mind.
###763 And after years of experience in building parks, we can
###766 really plan and [INAUDIBLE].
###767 It's a lot of fun.
###768 And you get to be more creative, where you just come
###770 out with a spray paint can, and just X on the ground.
###772 All right, we're starting here.
###774 There's always more to add on to some of the parks we've
###776 build before.
###776 So we're just going to keep on going.
###778 And we're never going to stop.
###780 -Do you have a favorite skate park here?
###783 DAVID TOMS: I'd have to say Stapel.
###785 -Who rips that place the hardest?
###787 DAVID TOMS: Jeremy.
###788 He's the man.
###789 
###793 JOHN MAGNUSSON: This park was started being planned 2001 and
###796 was finished end of 2005.
###799 One of the main goals for this skate park was to make people
###802 want to come here and explore what we have, to make it grow
###806 and make more people part of the skate scene.
###808 
###815 I moved to Malmo in 1998, mostly because of skating,
###819 because the big indoor park just opened up.
###822 The scene in Malmo in 1998 was far away from where it is now.
###826 There was this crew with Tobias, Nils, Pontus,
###829 [INAUDIBLE], John, really tight crew of 20 people.
###832 And they were kind of the guys behind the indoor park also.
###837 Three years after I moved down to Malmo, we kind of started
###840 to think together, the idea to create something like the
###843 indoor park but outside.
###846 It's built and designed by an American guy
###848 called Stefan Hauser.
###850 We've been working a lot with skate parks ourself.
###852 But this was kind of knew, the concrete.
###854 So we brought in someone that we believed and help us out.
###857 
###860 We want to have a little bit inspiration from Burnside and
###863 Santa Rosa.
###864 At the moment, these concrete parks in the States were
###866 looking a lot of vertical.
###867 So we said, don't build everything vertical.
###869 Trying to keep it a little bit lower, make it
###871 epic, a lot of flow.
###873 
###875 My favorite part of the park is everything.
###877 And you can just skate it for two hours, and you don't have
###880 to do one single trick.
###882 Check it out, my son's skating it at the moment.
###886 [SPEAKING SWEDISH]
###887 
###891 I don't know.
###892 He has 23 finger boards.
###895 Everything here comes from the skateboard organization called
###899 Bryggeriet.
###899 And we take care of the outdoor parks,
###902 Stapelbaddsparken and the smaller Sibbarp Skatepark, and
###905 the new one now.
###908 The city pays us to take care of it.
###910 And we have a really good cooperation with the city.
###912 We had a lot of big events here, like Quicksilver
###914 Bowlriders and Malmo Ultra Bowl and stuff, so that we do
###917 it together with them.
###919 
###925 NILS SVENSSON: How it's changed here in Malmo, it's
###927 hard to understand, really.
###928 But the city is so into what we're doing.
###933 They have had so much positive feedback that they just see it
###936 as such a good way of marketing Malmo.
###940 And now when they design parks and plazas and stuff, now they
###945 think, yeah, of course we should include skateboarding.
###948 And it's worth a lot for them, I think.
###950 
###963 [SPEAKING SWEDISH]
###968 -I read some stupid thing in some skateboard magazine.
###972 JOHN DAHLQUIST: I'm the teacher here at the skateboard
###975 part of Bryggeriets Gymnasium, the high school
###978 for skating in Malmo.
###981 Right now, we have 142 students.
###984 And it's three years, 16 to 18.
###990 During school hours, it's just students here.
###993 And then the park opens at 4:00.
###995 They do a lot of skating.
###997 And they skate from 9:00 in the morning until they close
###1000 here at 9:00 at night.
###1004 At the beginning of first year, we have something that
###1006 we call basic training.
###1008 But it shows pretty fast that what's basic to one person is
###1012 not to another.
###1014 There's everything from beginner to pro, pretty much.
###1018 There's room for everyone.
###1019 
###1023 NILS SVENSSON: This place generates a lot of talent and
###1029 keep skaters together.
###1031 The new generations are the kids that are in
###1034 this school, I think.
###1035 
###1037 [CHEERS]
###1039 FERNANDO BRAMSMARK: I think I started to skate
###1041 in the sixth grade.
###1043 It's like four years, or something like that.
###1047 -Did your parents give you a hard time about coming to a
###1049 skateboarding high school?
###1051 FERNANDO BRAMSMARK: I don't think so.
###1052 They only say, ah, enjoy.
###1054 Don't miss any lessons.
###1056 
###1058 -What's your favorite class, your favorite lesson?
###1061 FERNANDO BRAMSMARK: I think it's skate, the skate lesson.
###1064 
###1068 JOHN DAHLQUIST: There is two street courses in the vert
###1070 ramp and the bowl.
###1072 They're served these great state parks and great
###1075 opportunities.
###1077 I guess some of them think, why would you want to go
###1079 street skate?
###1080 There's cracks in the streets and ledges that aren't made
###1084 from steel.
###1085 
###1089 Actually, I have to sometimes yell at
###1091 people for not skating.
###1093 But I would never set any rules to how
###1095 anyone should skate.
###1096 There's never a moment of everyone having to do 10
###1100 kickflips, or anything like that.
###1101 Skateboarding has to be free, and never set any rules to how
###1106 someone's going to skate.
###1108 
###1116 -[SPEAKING SWEDISH]
###1122 LOVE ENEROTH: It's kind of unpopular, this spot.
###1124 If I propose that we go here to someone, they're like, uh,
###1127 let's go somewhere else.
###1130 There used to be water.
###1132 And I don't know why there's no water here now.
###1135 
###1152 LOVE ENEROTH: My name is Love Enertoth, co-founder of
###1155 Bellows Skateboards.
###1157 And I do the creative graphics and stuff.
###1163 I moved here, like, '97 to just pursue skating.
###1169 At that time, there wasn't really any skate companies.
###1173 There was more like shops, like G-Spot, for example.
###1176 
###1179 Seven years ago, probably, I went to Barcelona and sort of
###1183 stayed there, and went to France, too.
###1185 And I was riding for Antiz.
###1188 -Was it tough leaving Antiz?
###1190 Or were you over it?
###1193 LOVE ENEROTH: Yeah, was tough, because I was kind of getting
###1195 frustrated, not at them but at my situation.
###1199 I didn't just want to skateboard.
###1200 I wanted to do something creative.
###1202 
###1206 -Bellows is like a second generation European company.
###1210 Or even third, right?
###1211 You know--
###1212 LOVE ENEROTH: The Cliche.
###1213 -They were the first, and then Antiz.
###1215 And then now it's like people--
###1217 LOVE ENEROTH: Now it's a lot of companies.
###1219 
###1222 We started out as a team.
###1223 It was actually me, Martin, and Johan Florell, a friend of
###1228 ours who actually passed away recently.
###1232 But it was us who started it together, and with Mika.
###1236 
###1240 We just brainstormed how do we want a skateboard
###1243 company to feel like.
###1244 And so we came up with this.
###1246 
###1250 You shake your head really fast.
###1252 And then the flash will freeze your face.
###1255 So we thought that it would be funny to
###1256 do a series of portraits.
###1260 I think Mika had the fever that day.
###1262 He couldn't shake his head, so he was just blowing
###1265 air out of his lips.
###1267 
###1270 The best skating here is, I guess, the summer months from
###1275 probably May until the end of September, like early October.
###1280 
###1283 A lot of the spots is in the summer.
###1286 So there's a few in the downtown area,
###1288 but not that much.
###1289 So you've got to go on the train for 20 minutes.
###1298 [SPEAKING SWEDISH]
###1320 LOVE ENEROTH: This is a suburb of Stockholm.
###1323 And this is the backside of where we're going to skate.
###1327 And I don't what this is.
###1329 Little kids just put some shit here.
###1332 
###1343 SARAH MEURLE: My name is Sarah Meurle.
###1345 We're skating with my teammates from Bellows and a
###1351 friend of ours called Friedrich.
###1352 
###1355 I came here at the beginning of the summer, and I was out
###1358 skating with Mika every day.
###1360 He doesn't stop.
###1361 
###1368 LOVE ENEROTH: We got Sarah on the team.
###1370 She's like the first one who's not from Stockholm.
###1373 
###1376 Her board is coming out, actually.
###1378 SARAH MEURLE: It's going to be a--
###1379 LOVE ENEROTH: A sunflower.
###1380 SARAH MEURLE: --a sunflower that Love had drawn.
###1384 I went to school and all the boys were skating.
###1389 And I thought it seemed really fun.
###1392 And I just kept on skating with the other boys.
###1395 
###1397 If you go to my house, it's on a dirt road.
###1400 And there's nothing at all to skate.
###1403 So in the attic, me and my dad built a little quarter pipe
###1407 just next to my room, a small little bank on the other side
###1411 so you could kind of go back and forth.
###1414 I got sponsored by Streetlab, the skate shop in Malmo.
###1418 But I was small.
###1420 But it was really fun.
###1422 And I skated for them for a couple of years.
###1425 And then I started to get other sponsors.
###1426 
###1431 The first time I was on an airplane was 2
###1434 and 1/2 years ago.
###1435 And since then, I've been to so many places.
###1439 -All because of skating?
###1440 SARAH MEURLE: Yeah, pretty much.
###1441 -That's a pretty good deal.
###1443 SARAH MEURLE: Yeah.
###1445 
###1449 GREGER HAGELIN: I think it's Friday afternoon.
###1450 It's like people are still here.
###1452 Yeah, hey, bro, [INAUDIBLE].
###1455 -[INAUDIBLE].
###1455 GREGER HAGELIN: [INAUDIBLE]
###1457 was one of the guys that we met back
###1460 in the days in G-Spot.
###1461 He was a great skateboarder back then.
###1463 -Still am.
###1464 GREGER HAGELIN: Still am, yeah.
###1465 So we met back in the day.
###1468 So now he works here.
###1471 There's a lot of old skateboarders working here, or
###1473 young skateboarder, whatever you want to say.
###1474 
###1478 Down here, we have the financial department, the
###1479 design department, and the marketing department.
###1483 And this is what we call our lounge room.
###1486 You guys play ping pong?

###1492 Skateboarding is the most important subculture ever.
###1496 If you've been skateboarding for 10 years, whatever you do
###1499 with the rest of your life, you're going to still have the
###1501 same mentality, always remember being a skateboarder.
###1506 My generation, a lot of those guys got into it because it
###1510 was kind of trendy.
###1511 Then it died out.
###1512 After that, I started my own skateboard company, actually a
###1517 mail-order company out of my apartment named
###1519 Bam, Backside Airmail.
###1522 Called Backside Airmail, Bam, and our amazing stuff and make
###1526 sure it get the best skateboard products in three
###1529 to four days.
###1530 And that the [INAUDIBLE]
###1530 skateboard staff was me, myself, and I.
###1533 But It was kind of funny, because all the skaters in
###1537 Sweden called and they were like, you almost become a
###1539 friend to everybody.
###1539 It's like, hi, how are you?
###1542 Me and Pontus started working together back in '93.
###1546 I actually had a skateboard camp down in Gothenburg, and
###1549 Pontus was there.
###1550 Pontus Karlsson actually had his own mail order.
###1552 And we started talking, maybe we should open up a
###1554 distribution company together and open up a store.
###1558 
###1561 The reason why starting G-Spot was [INAUDIBLE]
###1565 skateboarding and have a good time.
###1567 And making money wasn't that important.
###1572 We did a lot of crazy stuff.
###1574 But we've never been doing anything to be mean.
###1577 To be in Sweden, you could actually do whatever.
###1581 Of course, the police came and knocked on the door and told
###1583 us to stop selling liquor and not have parties.
###1585 But we didn't really give a shit.
###1587 
###1595 -Was G-Spot known as the best shop?
###1598 JEAN-PASCAL STRUWER: It was the only shop to begin with.
###1601 Through hanging out at the G-Spot skate stop, I got to
###1604 know all the skaters and the cliques that
###1605 were hanging out there--
###1607 Jens Andersson, Pontus Karlsson, Pelle Fredell, a
###1614 couple more.
###1615 
###1618 Actually, I made the first video.
###1620 It was called "G-Spot Forever."
###1630 JENS ANDERSSON: Early '90s, the core group of
###1633 skateboarders in Stockholm couldn't be
###1635 more than 25, 30 people.
###1638 Skateboarding was really in for a change there.
###1642 And it was really ugly, fashion wise and tricks wise.
###1645 
###1648 The natural street skateboarding scene in
###1651 Stockholm has never been that good.
###1653 It has a very poor architecture for
###1655 skateboarding.
###1657 MARTIN KARLSSON: The ground is rough, so mini ramps was where
###1660 people learned how to skate.
###1662 
###1670 JEAN-PASCAL STRUWER: Right now, we are in a park called
###1672 [INAUDIBLE], which is a legendary skate spot in the
###1677 Stockholm skate scene.
###1680 It was one of the places where we hung out during the
###1683 summertime.
###1684 We would go to this mini ramp and buy beers and hang out and
###1688 laugh and have fun.
###1689 
###1696 JENS ANDERSSON: In the early days of Stockholm street
###1698 skating, there was people from different social backgrounds.
###1701 I mean, there were people from the really
###1703 upscale parts of Stockholm.
###1705 And there were people from the more rougher
###1708 neighborhoods as well.
###1709 MARTIN KARLSSON: Some of the skaters moved in from
###1711 different parts of Sweden, and we lived collectively.
###1717 It was a strange period.
###1718 No one really knows how anyone got by financially.
###1723 JENS ANDERSSON: Sell some boards, some sweatshirts, and
###1725 maybe sell something else as well.
###1727 
###1731 Well, the main spot, for sure, was Sheraton
###1733 Hotel, as we call it.
###1735 But it's not really part of Sheraton Hotel.
###1737 It's just a delivery area for some shops.
###1741 It was outdoor but still has a ceiling over it.
###1744 So you were able to skate there all year round.
###1747 But there was these high metal curbs and a manual
###1752 pad, and that's it.
###1753 And everybody was skating there 10 hours a day, and
###1756 coming in from all over Sweden just to skate this spot.
###1760 
###1764 [CLAPPING]
###1765 MARTIN KARLSSON: You get that?
###1768 Always when you cut yourself down here, you're like, what
###1771 was that I cut myself on?
###1772 
###1774 JENS ANDERSSON: And you kind of remember the feeling you
###1778 had when you were skating back then.
###1780 
###1784 -When we looked at the book "The Sheraton Years," that was
###1786 like the golden age for you guys in terms of fun?
###1789 GREGER HAGELIN: It was, like, I mean, there's four
###1790 generations of skateboarding.
###1793 Jens did send that book to me.
###1795 So I it at my office in LA.
###1797 And I opened that book-- it was a Friday afternoon--
###1799 and started reading it.
###1800 And I started to remember.
###1801 And I started feeling really sad, because skateboarding was
###1804 very small at that time.
###1806 And the same crowd of people went to every contest, went to
###1810 every spot, went out drinking every night together.
###1813 And it was a very, very special time, for sure.
###1820 JENS ANDERSSON: There was a lot of
###1820 pictures to choose from.
###1822 And we decided to go with the more insecure teenager on the
###1828 way of growing up kind of direction.
###1832 I never really had an intention of being a skate
###1834 photographer.
###1835 But at the time, I always had a camera in my backpack,
###1838 shooting regularly just the people around me.
###1842 Rather than trying to get the perfect skate photo, I'm just
###1846 trying to document the time we were spending together.
###1851 There was definitely a turning point when the new
###1854 skate park opened up.
###1856 JENS ANDERSSON: YMCA.
###1858 The chief for the YMCA, he was really into doing stuff for
###1863 kids and teens, and trying to put his mind
###1866 into subcultural stuff.
###1868 MARTIN KARLSSON: So we had something for the graffiti
###1870 people and for the skateboarders.
###1871 And he even had a pub for
###1873 skinheads down in the basement.
###1876 They had taken skateboards from the skateboarders and
###1879 snapped them in half and put them on the wall.
###1883 That was how crazy it was, that place.
###1888 Ali Boulala, back then he was so lightweight, so small he
###1893 could jump down anything.
###1894 When we started skating with him, he cried every time he
###1898 skated, because he was so frustrated when he didn't
###1901 skate good enough.
###1903 You know, he was a huge Mike Carroll fan at this time.
###1906 I think this is the day after he watched
###1908 the Chocolate video.
###1909 And Mike Carroll does the feeble in Hubba Hideout.
###1913 And he's just like, oh, I got to do that.
###1914 And he learned it.
###1916 But he was always really aware of what was going on in
###1921 skateboarding, trick-wise, style-wise.
###1923 He always made the right moves.
###1926 
###1931 Greger drinking 40s, Santa Monica beach.
###1935 JENS ANDERSSON: The G-Spot era, I think that was very
###1937 important to the fact that skate wing was getting back in
###1941 the limelight again.
###1942 And it was really cool.
###1943 And there was different companies that could offer
###1946 money and sponsor stuff.
###1948 We could step out of the garage, you
###1950 know, out of the darkness.
###1953 -Would you bring a lot of the skaters to the ASR Trade Show
###1956 in Long Beach?
###1957 GREGER HAGELIN: Yeah, sure.
###1957 It's like our team, we used to bring them there.
###1960 So [INAUDIBLE], Andreas, Ali Boulala, and
###1963 all those guys, yeah.
###1966 Back then it was like we were part of this business
###1969 just to have fun.
###1970 And then we did that business from '93 to '99.
###1973 And then we decided start up WESC.
###1975 
###1981 This is a collaboration we do with Be@rbricks, Medicom Toys.
###1984 And going to be released in January.
###1990 You're from New York, so you'll probably know Stash.
###1991 -Yes.
###1992 GREGER HAGELIN: He's From Brooklyn as well.
###1994 And this is a pair of his denim.
###1996 But this is with a gold thread in it.
###1998 And if you should sell them, should
###1999 probably cost about $5,000.
###2003 So we don't sell those.
###2004 
###2006 Then we had G-Spot.
###2008 G was for a Swedish word and name.
###2010 [SWEDISH]
###2011 is like all of us together.
###2013 And then [INAUDIBLE], it's actually the same
###2015 feeling about us.
###2019 I came down to [INAUDIBLE], that skateboard place.
###2022 And my son, he was 12 at that time, and he was down there
###2026 skateboarding.
###2026 And every good skateboarder he saw came up, hi, how are you?
###2029 How are you?
###2030 And he's like, how can you know all those guys?
###2031 Yeah, that's skateboarding.
###2032 It's like you met them once, and you know them for life.
###2036 -Is your son aware of all the generations of skateboarding?
###2039 Does he see all the old pictures.
###2041 GREGER HAGELIN: He's 13.
###2042 He thinks everyone back then sucked.
###2045 Of course, it's like in 10 years from now, he'll probably
###2047 respect it, but you know.
###2049 -Yeah, that's typical.
###2051 
###2064 -Pelle Fredell, he's my father, Pelle Fredell.
###2068 He gives me everything I want, man.
###2070 
###2089 -[SPEAKING SWEDISH]
###2106
