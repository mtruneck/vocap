###32 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Oh-ho, man, that was awesome. Thanks to everyone at Oresman (ph)
###35 Middle for getting things going today with that I- Report.
###37 From your mock debate, we are going to jump right into the presidential debate.
###42 Last night was the third and final face-off between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. This
###46 debate was held at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida, and it focused on foreign
###51 policy. So we are talking about ways in which the United States interacts with the rest
###55 of the world. Election day is exactly two weeks away. Candidates will still be out at
###60 events on the campaign trail. But last night was the last chance they had to present some
###65 of their ideas to a large audience all at once. Here is some of what happened.
###71 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###81 MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I absolutely believe that America has a responsibility
###86 and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that make the world
###92 more peaceful, and those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise,
###99 freedom of expression, elections because when there are elections people tend to vote for
###104 peace. They don`t vote for war. So we want to promote those principles around the world.
###109 We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world. We want to end those conflicts
###114 to the extend humanly possible. But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world,
###120 America must be strong.
###121 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: America remains the one indispensable
###124 nation and the world needs a strong America and it is stronger now than when I came into
###131 office. Because we ended the war in Iraq we were able to refocus our attention on not
###137 only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan. It also
###142 allowed us to refocus on alliances, relationships that have been neglected for a decade. And
###149 Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger. In Asia, in Europe, in Africa,
###157 with Israel where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing
###163 with the Iranian threat.
###164 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###165 AZUZ: One of the topics that came up during last night debate was outsourcing. It`s when
###169 a company has a different business do some kind of work. So, instead of doing it themselves,
###174 companies pay someone else to do it. Outsourcing can help companies save money and maybe help
###179 keep cost down on the products that they sell. But if U.S company outsources work to a different
###184 country, it means those jobs aren`t being done by American workers. Maggie Lake has
###189 more on the impact of outsourcing and the presidential candidates` plans to do something
###193 about it.
###193 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###194 MITT ROMNEY: Thank you.
###195 PAUL RYAN: Thank you.
###195 MAGGIE LAKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Whether on the campaign trail ...
###198 ROMNEY: If there is an outsourcer-in-chief, it`s the president of the United States.
###202 LAKE: Or amid the barrage of political ads on TV.
###204 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mitt Romney`s firms were pioneers at helping companies outsource their
###209 manufacturing to countries including China.
###212 LAKE: Outsourcing is a hot button issue again in presidential politics. In states like Ohio,
###219 Pennsylvania and Michigan where scores of factory jobs have been lost, it is a deeply
###224 emotional issue.
###225 JOE KLEIN, TIME MAGAZINE: They do a lot of focus grouping, and polling and testing. And
###229 what they find is, that this is very resonant.
###231 LAKE: In recent years, the manufacturing sector of the U.S. has been hit particularly hard.
###236 Over five and a half million jobs lost between 2000 and 2009. A million alone to China. But
###243 that tide maybe turning as companies rethink their commitment to lower wage countries.
###247 HAL SIRKIN, BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP: Wages in China are, you know, topping $3 an hour.
###251 Wages will probably be something around $6 an hour or so in 2015. It starts to become
###256 competitive with the U.S., you have the intellectual property risk, and being far away from (ph)
###260 consumer means you are not on top of the trends.
###262 LAKE: General Electric and Caterpillar are just a few of the companies who have recently
###266 brought some of their production back to the U.S. Economists warn the manufacturing revival
###271 has a long way to go, but both candidates are pledging they can get the job done.
###277 Mitt Romney continues to call for lower taxes for businesses, just for investment. And tougher
###281 trade relations with China.
###283 President Obama is also calling for tax incentives for companies that bring jobs back to the
###288 U.S. and touting the auto industry bailout which Romney opposed. Maggie Lake, CNN, New York.
###294 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###295 AZUZ: All right, next stop: Lance Armstrong. He won cycling`s most famous race, seven times
###300 in a row, but you can`t call him a Tour de France champion anymore. Yesterday, the International
###306 Cycling Union said it was wiping out Armstrong`s titles and banning him from the sport.
###313 This was in response to a report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. It says there is
###317 overwhelming evidence that Armstrong used banned performance enhancing drugs during
###322 his career. Armstrong has always denied that. In addition to losing his Tour de France titles,
###327 Armstrong is being asked to return nearly $4 million that he won for those seven Tour
###333 victories.
###334 Cheerleaders, they`ve got spirit? Yes, they do. But they do a lot more than just chant
###339 and clap and try to get the home crows excited. We are talking about pyramids, flips, tosses.
###346 Cheerleading involves some pretty serious acrobatic stance, and that`s got some doctors
###350 concerned about some pretty serious injuries. The American Academy of Pediatrics just put
###355 out a new policy on cheerleading injuries. The group says that injury rate in cheerleading
###359 is low compared to other sports, but the number of catastrophic injuries, like brain and spinal
###365 cord injuries in cheering is going up. The new policy suggests that cheerleaders limit
###371 their stance and avoid doing them on hard surfaces, and that they should be checked
###375 for concussions if they have a head injury.

###379 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today "Shoutout" goes out to Ms. Kreicker in the Cougar Culture
###383 Club at South Middle School in Lawrence, Kansas. "Which of these positions is the leader of
###389 a marching band? Here we go, is it: the field marshal, drill instructor, drum major or concertmaster?
###397 You`ve got three seconds, go!
###402 A marching band is led by its drum major. That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."
###411 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###412 AZUZ: At the University of Missouri, the drum major leads a marching band of more than 300
###417 members. It`s one of the largest college marching bands in the country. Now, its current head
###422 drum major says he wanted the job so that people could look up to him in difficult times,
###427 but he wasn`t just talking about the marching band. Dr. Sanjay Gupta explains what we mean.
###432 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###435 DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: As a drum major for marching Missou (ph), the University
###444 of Missouri`s famed marching band, Paul Heddings is living his dream.
###448 It`s a new dream, because his original dream of playing professional baseball was disappearing.
###454 PAUL HEDDINGS, UNIV. OF MISSOURI DRUM MAJOR: September Seventh, 2007, just (inaudible)
###460 my junior high school ...
###461 GUPTA: The 17-year old woke up, and his world was changing.
###465 HEDDINGS: Everything was just a little blurry, it didn`t seem like anything was wrong.
###468 GUPTA: But something was terribly wrong. His retinas had detached and started to tear apart
###474 in both eyes.
###474 HEDDINGS: I didn`t know how my life would change, what I`d be able to do, what I wouldn`t
###478 be able to do. I could potentially go completely blind ...
###481 GUPTA: Paul says this was not caused by disease or trauma, but by genetics.
###486 HEDDINGS: This has happened to my mom, my grandma and a couple of uncles. Even my little
###490 sister is having some more issues.
###492 GUPTA: They didn`t lose much vision. Paul, on the other hand, is now legally blind. Sight
###497 in his best eye can`t be corrected beyond 2200. He says family, friends and music saved
###504 his life. He joined his high school drum line, taking the music home, magnifying it, memorizing
###511 it.
###511 HEDDINGS: Here we go, be flat!
###513 I just, you know, strapped up my boots and went to work.
###519 GUPTA: He made the Missou (ph) drum line first playing cymbals and then after an extensive
###523 interview process clinched the coveted drum major spot. Most in the band didn`t even know
###532 he was legally blind.
###534 Heddings hopes his time on the letter will change the perception of visually impaired
###539 people.
###539 HEDDINGS: I want to be able to say when I leave here that I did something special, and
###545 that I didn`t let this hold me back.

###548 AZUZ: Great story. Finally today, we have a cavalcade of costume canines (ph). It may
###553 look like a dog, but this is guy is a real turkey. Gobbling up for bunch of attention
###557 at a Halloween parade for pooches. A hot dog costume for a dog? Come on, that`s too easy.
###564 Hello, if he falls behind on the parade, he`ll have to catch-up. It may seem out of the ordinary
###568 to see a dog dressed up like a former first lady of Argentina, but it`s just a sign of
###573 the season. After all, we are right around the corner from Halloween. We`ve reached the
###577 tail in the today show but we will be bark tomorrow, more CNN STUDENT NEWS. I hope to
###582 see you all then.
