THOMAS: Hi, I'm Thomas Morton.


3
0:0:6,19 --> 0:0:10,58
We're here in the sewer system
of Bogota, Colombia, a place


4
0:0:10,58 --> 0:0:15,35
where for the past 30 years, the
city's kind of lower-rung


5
0:0:15,35 --> 0:0:18,65
street kids have sought refuge
from the right wing death


6
0:0:18,65 --> 0:0:22,71
squads, which fairly regularly
patrol the city above.


7
0:0:22,71 --> 0:0:24,83
In the late '80s, kind of the
height of the epidemic of


8
0:0:24,83 --> 0:0:28,34
street kids here, small business
owners and kind of


9
0:0:28,34 --> 0:0:31,79
the wealthy elite started
raising death squads to help


10
0:0:31,79 --> 0:0:37,33
rid their property of what they
thought as disposables, a


11
0:0:37,33 --> 0:0:39,1
process which they kind
of cheerfully


12
0:0:39,1 --> 0:0:40,82
called social cleansing.


13
0:0:40,82 --> 0:0:43,0
One of the only people in
Colombia to help the sewer


14
0:0:43,0 --> 0:0:46,32
children, Dr. Jaime Jaramillo,
has pulled thousands of kids


15
0:0:46,32 --> 0:0:47,3
out of the pipes.


16
0:0:47,3 --> 0:0:50,22
But at the same time, a lot
of them still remain.


17
0:0:50,22 --> 0:0:52,84
We asked Dr. Jaramillo to take
us down here and show us how


18
0:0:52,84 --> 0:0:56,6
the kids live in some cases and
what's in store for the


19
0:0:56,6 --> 0:0:57,31
refugees on their way in.


20
0:0:57,31 --> 0:1:0,58



21
0:1:0,58 --> 0:1:6,47
This is the same tube that
15 years ago our friend


22
0:1:6,47 --> 0:1:8,1
Alberto lived in.


23
0:1:8,1 --> 0:1:10,28
We're going to go sit down and
talk with Alberto about having


24
0:1:10,28 --> 0:1:13,78
lived in the sewers and about
how he's been since.


25
0:1:13,78 --> 0:1:16,67
God, not having light
down there.


26
0:1:16,67 --> 0:1:21,185
Just the prospect of that
makes me shudder.

suited up.


31
0:2:18,99 --> 0:2:21,74
We got these fishing waders.


32
0:2:21,74 --> 0:2:23,11
This almost seems like it might


33
0:2:23,11 --> 0:2:24,335
even be a little excessive.


34
0:2:24,335 --> 0:2:29,425
But I guess, considering what
we're about to do, better safe


35
0:2:29,425 --> 0:2:34,14
than coming down with cholera
or something.


36
0:2:34,14 --> 0:2:37,88
Dr. Jaime is going to give me
acupuncture now to help my


37
0:2:37,88 --> 0:2:38,55
immune system.


38
0:2:38,55 --> 0:2:39,58
I hate needles.


39
0:2:39,58 --> 0:2:41,73
So I'm concerned about this.


40
0:2:41,73 --> 0:2:51,51



41
0:2:51,51 --> 0:2:53,13
It's treacherous even
getting down here.


42
0:2:53,13 --> 0:2:54,31
Did you see the rat?


43
0:2:54,31 --> 0:2:57,41
Yeah, I just saw that
rat scurry up there.


44
0:2:57,41 --> 0:2:58,4
So this is it.

They're right behind us.


72
0:4:24,805 --> 0:4:26,545
They don't want to be filmed,
though, because they're


73
0:4:26,545 --> 0:4:29,822
worried about the police finding
out where they are.

79
0:4:50,48 --> 0:4:51,53
about to smoke up.


80
0:4:51,53 --> 0:4:55,42
So they're a little jumpy

81
0:4:55,42 --> 0:4:56,96
didn't want to be filmed.


82
0:4:56,96 --> 0:5:0,3
Because they're afraid that if
this gets out, then the police


83
0:5:0,3 --> 0:5:0,83
will know where they are.


84
0:5:0,83 --> 0:5:2,22

beat the shit out of them.

0:15:22,39 --> 0:15:27,932



212
0:15:27,932 --> 0:15:30,31
THOMAS: Is that the last time
you were harassed here?


213
0:15:30,31 --> 0:15:32,927
Or have they harassed
you since?


214
0:15:32,927 --> 0:15:34,177
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


215
0:15:34,177 --> 0:15:39,445



216
0:15:39,445 --> 0:15:44,13
TRANSLATOR: They usually pick
Sundays, such as today.


217
0:15:44,13 --> 0:15:47,2
THOMAS: This is like one of
those ghost stories, where


218
0:15:47,2 --> 0:15:50,38
they're like, and it was
30 years ago tonight in


219
0:15:50,38 --> 0:15:52,3
this very camp spot.


220
0:15:52,3 --> 0:15:55,285
And then they describe exactly
what you're wearing as what


221
0:15:55,285 --> 0:15:56,535
the killer liked.


222
0:15:56,535 --> 0:16:1,24



223
0:16:1,24 --> 0:16:4,733
So we're fucking stepping
off into the abyss here.


224
0:16:4,733 --> 0:16:6,315
It's starting to get
really slippery.


225
0:16:6,315 --> 0:16:10,69



226
0:16:10,69 --> 0:16:13,66
The smell, I feel like
it gets exponentially


227
0:16:13,66 --> 0:16:15,46
worse with every step.


228
0:16:15,46 --> 0:16:20,6
Right now we're at, like,
county fair port-a-john.


229
0:16:20,6 --> 0:16:20,92
I mean, this is just shit.


230
0:16:20,92 --> 0:16:23,29
DR. JARAMILLO: This is
human waste, a rat.


231
0:16:23,29 --> 0:16:24,6
THOMAS: Probably shouldn't
be touching the wall.


232
0:16:24,6 --> 0:16:27,25



233
0:16:27,25 --> 0:16:29,5
This right here, this
keeps going.


234
0:16:29,5 --> 0:16:30,73
How long has it been
since it rained?


235
0:16:30,73 --> 0:16:32,21
DR. JARAMILLO: A month ago.


236
0:16:32,21 --> 0:16:33,46
THOMAS: It was a month.


237
0:16:33,46 --> 0:16:38,18
And it's like we're shin deep.


238
0:16:38,18 --> 0:16:39,7
Were there people in here?


239
0:16:39,7 --> 0:16:40,68
DR. JARAMILLO: Yeah.


240
0:16:40,68 --> 0:16:42,361
THOMAS: How many?


241
0:16:42,361 --> 0:16:43,975
DR. JARAMILLO: [INAUDIBLE]
like 20.


242
0:16:43,975 --> 0:16:45,69
But the other side.


243
0:16:45,69 --> 0:16:46,98
THOMAS: How far?


244
0:16:46,98 --> 0:16:49,9
DR. JARAMILLO: Like
10 minutes.


245
0:16:49,9 --> 0:16:51,6
THOMAS: So we're right
at the point where


246
0:16:51,6 --> 0:16:52,26
it's no longer safe.


247
0:16:52,26 --> 0:16:56,697
DR. JARAMILLO: And it's not good
to stay very long here.


248
0:16:56,697 --> 0:16:57,69
THOMAS: People could come.


249
0:16:57,69 --> 0:16:58,46
I can't see.


250
0:16:58,46 --> 0:17:2,53
Can you kill the light
for a second?


251
0:17:2,53 --> 0:17:4,54
Because nobody comes here
with flashlights.


252
0:17:4,54 --> 0:17:11,38



253
0:17:11,38 --> 0:17:12,63
Jesus Christ!


254
0:17:12,63 --> 0:17:15,3



255
0:17:15,3 --> 0:17:18,178
I can barely--


256
0:17:18,178 --> 0:17:20,27
I just want to see
how long before


257
0:17:20,27 --> 0:17:24,599

THOMAS: You can kind of see a
little bit of light there.


261
0:17:36,796 --> 0:17:38,58
And a little bit
of light there.

0:17:39,83 --> 0:17:48,4

265
0:17:49,9 --> 0:17:52,94
I feel like shit is crawling
up inside me.


266
0:17:52,94 --> 0:17:55,215

a rat chewing on me.

yourself to madness.


270
0:18:5,18 --> 0:18:9,53



271
0:18:9,53 --> 0:18:10,79
OK, let's get the
lights back on.


272
0:18:10,79 --> 0:18:12,96
I'm fucked.


273
0:18:12,96 --> 0:18:14,19
That did it.


274
0:18:14,19 --> 0:18:16,12
That did it for me.


275
0:18:16,12 --> 0:18:16,65
Lights, please.


276
0:18:16,65 --> 0:18:17,67
Thank you.

THOMAS: We ran into this guy
who lives here in what he


281
0:19:1,6 --> 0:19:6,309
calls his penthouse by the sea
whose wife is also pregnant.

THOMAS: By far the most
luxurious place.


284
0:19:13,76 --> 0:19:16,47
I had to wedge myself
up through a little


285
0:19:16,47 --> 0:19:19,51
hole to get in here.


286
0:19:19,51 --> 0:19:22,76
It's really spacious
and safe feeling.


287
0:19:22,76 --> 0:19:25,25
But you have to watch
out so you don't cut


288
0:19:25,25 --> 0:19:27,59
your head on the pipes.


289
0:19:27,59 --> 0:19:29,29

will you go to the hospital?


296

Or will you--

This place is great.

So we should turn the

377
0:24:13,22 --> 0:24:15,67
OK, we're getting
out of here now.


378
0:24:15,67 --> 0:24:17,1
Last night we were
in the sewers.


379
0:24:17,1 --> 0:24:20,1
Our night ended with the arrival
of a death squad.


380
0:24:20,1 --> 0:24:23,905
After they left, we fucking
jetted out of there.


381
0:24:23,905 --> 0:24:26,1
They parked a little
bit up the sewers.


382
0:24:26,1 --> 0:24:27,455
And we had to go and hide.


383
0:24:27,455 --> 0:24:29,155
There was about 10 or 15 guys.


384
0:24:29,155 --> 0:24:30,725
Some of them were in
police uniform.


385
0:24:30,725 --> 0:24:31,775
Some of them were in military.


386
0:24:31,775 --> 0:24:35,12
And some of them were in
just civilian clothes.


387
0:24:35,12 --> 0:24:37,35
The ones we could see kind of
from where we were, our


388
0:24:37,35 --> 0:24:39,775
vantage point, were armed
to the fucking teeth.


389
0:24:39,775 --> 0:24:42,59
They all had fucking machine
guns, packing pistols, too.


390
0:24:42,59 --> 0:24:44,54
We're in the car right now on
the way to the airport.


391
0:24:44,54 --> 0:24:47,15
Five minutes ago,
Jaime called us.


392
0:24:47,15 --> 0:24:51,62
And last night, three sewers
were gasolined and burnt.


393
0:24:51,62 --> 0:24:58,9
So it's funny to say,
considering the kind of shit


394
0:24:58,9 --> 0:25:1,73
we've seen while we were down
here, that we've gotten the


395
0:25:1,73 --> 0:25:3,16
absolute best of it.


396
0:25:3,16 --> 0:25:7,17
We've had the best of luck and
not run into any trouble.


397
0:25:7,17 --> 0:25:9,6
And even so, we've
run into cops.


398
0:25:9,6 --> 0:25:10,56
We've run into a death squad.


399
0:25:10,56 --> 0:25:14,265
We've been knee-high
in fucking shit.


400
0:25:14,265 --> 0:25:17,5



401
0:25:17,5 --> 0:25:21,5
And that's the best the sewers
have to ofter to anybody.


402
0:25:21,5 --> 0:25:23,12
And we're on our way
out right now.


403
0:25:23,12 --> 0:25:26,13
We're heading back to our cushy
fucking apartments in


404
0:25:26,13 --> 0:25:26,83
the United States.


405
0:25:26,83 --> 0:25:29,41
And these people have
to sit here and live


406
0:25:29,41 --> 0:25:31,49
with this every day.


407
0:25:31,49 --> 0:25:32,74
It's fucked.


408
0:25:32,74 --> 0:27:32,74
