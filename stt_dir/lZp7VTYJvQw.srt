0:0:0,17 --> 0:0:1,82
STEVE SPANGLER: You know, Fourth
of July used to be fun.


3
0:0:1,82 --> 0:0:4,22
But ever since the police ruined
it by saying you can't


4
0:0:4,22 --> 0:0:7,65
light fireworks, I've had to
come up with some new ideas


5
0:0:7,65 --> 0:0:10,24
for the huge crowd of people
that come to my house every


6
0:0:10,24 --> 0:0:12,515
year looking for fun on
the Fourth of July.


7
0:0:12,515 --> 0:0:15,34
I think you're going
to like this.


8
0:0:15,34 --> 0:0:16,55
I'm Steve Spangler.


9
0:0:16,55 --> 0:0:18,49
And I'm all about making
science fun.


10
0:0:18,49 --> 0:0:21,45
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


11
0:0:21,45 --> 0:0:24,44
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


12
0:0:24,44 --> 0:0:25,48
experiences.


13
0:0:25,48 --> 0:0:28,8
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


14
0:0:28,8 --> 0:0:30,24
affect the way people
think about science.


15
0:0:30,24 --> 0:0:33,16
And to do that, I live
by one motto.


16
0:0:33,16 --> 0:0:34,27
Make it big.


17
0:0:34,27 --> 0:0:35,81
Do it right.


18
0:0:35,81 --> 0:0:37,6
Give it class.


19
0:0:37,6 --> 0:0:41,255



20
0:0:41,255 --> 0:0:44,16
You know, nothing says Fourth
of July more than red cups,


21
0:0:44,16 --> 0:0:47,19
right here, for soft
drinks, of course.


22
0:0:47,19 --> 0:0:50,6
But I was thinking, why not
for a little science


23
0:0:50,6 --> 0:0:50,345
experiment?


24
0:0:50,345 --> 0:0:53,11
So we're going to show you kind
of a classic Spangler


25
0:0:53,11 --> 0:0:57,38
science experiment using red
Solo cups and some dry ice.


26
0:0:57,38 --> 0:0:58,76
All right, for the first
step, you've got to put


27
0:0:58,76 --> 0:0:59,87
a hole in the cup.


28
0:0:59,87 --> 0:1:0,92
So we want a hole right here.


29
0:1:0,92 --> 0:1:3,87
And probably the easiest way to
do that is to just use an


30
0:1:3,87 --> 0:1:6,61
Exacto knife or some sort of
knife and just kind of start


31
0:1:6,61 --> 0:1:9,56
to cut in just a little
bit if you want.


32
0:1:9,56 --> 0:1:11,935
And finish this up with
a pair of scissors.


33
0:1:11,935 --> 0:1:14,99
So we're just going to cut
a little hole in the cup.


34
0:1:14,99 --> 0:1:17,33
It doesn't have to
look pretty.


35
0:1:17,33 --> 0:1:18,47
This isn't Martha
Stewart hour.


36
0:1:18,47 --> 0:1:21,21
I'm just putting a
hole in a cup.


37
0:1:21,21 --> 0:1:22,35
Look at that.


38
0:1:22,35 --> 0:1:23,61
Magic, right there.


39
0:1:23,61 --> 0:1:25,25
Hole in a cup.


40
0:1:25,25 --> 0:1:27,79
Step two, Saran Wrap.


41
0:1:27,79 --> 0:1:30,3
You need a hunk of Saran Wrap.


42
0:1:30,3 --> 0:1:30,47
That's OK.


43
0:1:30,47 --> 0:1:32,51
Really, they make it so easy
to get it right out of this


44
0:1:32,51 --> 0:1:33,69
container right here.


45
0:1:33,69 --> 0:1:35,4
Just follow their directions.


46
0:1:35,4 --> 0:1:36,29
It's perfectly fine.


47
0:1:36,29 --> 0:1:38,49
You just need to kind of put
this in here like this and


48
0:1:38,49 --> 0:1:40,43
just kind of pull it.


49
0:1:40,43 --> 0:1:41,94
Pull it across like--


50
0:1:41,94 --> 0:1:44,31
it's pretty easy to
get this out.


51
0:1:44,31 --> 0:1:46,766
You just need a small piece.


52
0:1:46,766 --> 0:1:48,47
So we're just going to
use a small little


53
0:1:48,47 --> 0:1:50,0
chunk of Saran Wrap.


54
0:1:50,0 --> 0:1:52,82
And we'll use that
up next time.


55
0:1:52,82 --> 0:1:54,5
And you're going to stretch it
right over the top like this,


56
0:1:54,5 --> 0:1:55,77
kind of like a little drum.


57
0:1:55,77 --> 0:1:57,32
That's what you want.


58
0:1:57,32 --> 0:2:3,15
And a rubber band to secure
the whole thing in place.


59
0:2:3,15 --> 0:2:5,71
And simply cut off the small
little excess that


60
0:2:5,71 --> 0:2:7,31
you have over here.


61
0:2:7,31 --> 0:2:9,91



62
0:2:9,91 --> 0:2:12,79
We're going to recycle
this for later.


63
0:2:12,79 --> 0:2:13,78
Next comes the best part.


64
0:2:13,78 --> 0:2:15,25
And that is dry ice.


65
0:2:15,25 --> 0:2:17,45
So get yourself a
little dry ice.


66
0:2:17,45 --> 0:2:20,28
Now, you've got to be careful,
because it's 78 degrees below


67
0:2:20,28 --> 0:2:25,19
0 Fahrenheit, or 110 degrees
below 0 Celsius.


68
0:2:25,19 --> 0:2:26,84
Regardless, it's really,
really cold.


69
0:2:26,84 --> 0:2:29,25
So when you get dry ice, you're
going to break it up


70
0:2:29,25 --> 0:2:30,79
into some small little pieces.


71
0:2:30,79 --> 0:2:33,6
And that's what we're looking
for here are just a couple


72
0:2:33,6 --> 0:2:37,28
small pieces that will fit right
into the little cup.


73
0:2:37,28 --> 0:2:37,85
Good.


74
0:2:37,85 --> 0:2:39,45
There's a little piece there.


75
0:2:39,45 --> 0:2:41,64
This is pretty good.


76
0:2:41,64 --> 0:2:42,82
This guy's looking good.


77
0:2:42,82 --> 0:2:43,2
Perfect.


78
0:2:43,2 --> 0:2:44,38
All right.


79
0:2:44,38 --> 0:2:44,89
See?


80
0:2:44,89 --> 0:2:46,785
There's our dry ice
in the cup.


81
0:2:46,785 --> 0:2:49,26
The last part is you need
a little bit of water.


82
0:2:49,26 --> 0:2:50,95
So take some water.


83
0:2:50,95 --> 0:2:53,92
You're going to pour the
water into the hole.


84
0:2:53,92 --> 0:2:57,43
Because the dry ice is in there,
we should get a little


85
0:2:57,43 --> 0:3:0,6
of that fog that starts
to come out.


86
0:3:0,6 --> 0:3:1,66
That's perfect.


87
0:3:1,66 --> 0:3:2,99
Now, it may be too much.


88
0:3:2,99 --> 0:3:5,4
But this is the whole idea,
is that you tap


89
0:3:5,4 --> 0:3:5,93
on the bottom here.


90
0:3:5,93 --> 0:3:8,79
And as you do that, it takes the
air that's inside the cup


91
0:3:8,79 --> 0:3:10,32
and forces it out that hole.


92
0:3:10,32 --> 0:3:13,7
And that fast-moving air creates
a little thing called


93
0:3:13,7 --> 0:3:15,19
Bernoulli's principle, which is
just a little vortex ring


94
0:3:15,19 --> 0:3:15,99
that you get to see.


95
0:3:15,99 --> 0:3:17,57
Watch.


96
0:3:17,57 --> 0:3:19,45
Oh, these are looking good.


97
0:3:19,45 --> 0:3:21,1
Isn't that fantastic?


98
0:3:21,1 --> 0:3:22,91
So what can you do with
these vortex rings?


99
0:3:22,91 --> 0:3:24,4
Well, you could stand
around in the house


100
0:3:24,4 --> 0:3:25,27
all day and do this.


101
0:3:25,27 --> 0:3:28,17
Or you can invite friends
over and do this.


102
0:3:28,17 --> 0:3:31,2
Or you could blow
out a candle.


103
0:3:31,2 --> 0:3:32,71
That's been done.


104
0:3:32,71 --> 0:3:35,53
You can decide, let's
make it bigger.


105
0:3:35,53 --> 0:3:37,88
Well, if the red cup is fun,
that means this five-gallon


106
0:3:37,88 --> 0:3:39,23
bucket will even be better.


107
0:3:39,23 --> 0:3:42,67
And you just need to make some
slight modifications to the


108
0:3:42,67 --> 0:3:44,42
five-gallon bucket
and you'll have a


109
0:3:44,42 --> 0:3:46,38
perfect smoke ring launcher.


110
0:3:46,38 --> 0:3:48,6
And you need some tools.


111
0:3:48,6 --> 0:3:50,18
While you could try to just
cut a hole in here, it's a


112
0:3:50,18 --> 0:3:50,81
little bit harder.


113
0:3:50,81 --> 0:3:54,71
That's why this little keyhole
saw seems to do the trick.


114
0:3:54,71 --> 0:3:55,96
Watch this.


115
0:3:55,96 --> 0:4:3,33



116
0:4:3,33 --> 0:4:5,66
Now you're the life
of the party.


117
0:4:5,66 --> 0:4:7,45
We're going to modify the
lid so that there's


118
0:4:7,45 --> 0:4:8,54
a ring that's left.


119
0:4:8,54 --> 0:4:10,79
Just invite your friends
over early and


120
0:4:10,79 --> 0:4:12,4
tell them to do this.


121
0:4:12,4 --> 0:4:18,1



122
0:4:18,1 --> 0:4:19,26
Perfect.


123
0:4:19,26 --> 0:4:21,3



124
0:4:21,3 --> 0:4:24,18
Who said that wasn't
going to be fun?


125
0:4:24,18 --> 0:4:28,5
So now we have a bucket that has
a lid with a huge hole in


126
0:4:28,5 --> 0:4:31,39
it, and a bottom that doesn't
hold anything.


127
0:4:31,39 --> 0:4:33,59
This is perfect for our
science experiment.


128
0:4:33,59 --> 0:4:35,446
Now you need a shower curtain.


129
0:4:35,446 --> 0:4:38,175
I like to use these clear
shower curtains.


130
0:4:38,175 --> 0:4:38,89
It's perfect.


131
0:4:38,89 --> 0:4:41,98
They're nice and durable,
and they make


132
0:4:41,98 --> 0:4:43,335
the best little membrane.


133
0:4:43,335 --> 0:4:46,4
The object here is just
to secure this


134
0:4:46,4 --> 0:4:47,94
piece of vinyl in place.


135
0:4:47,94 --> 0:4:50,54
While you could use bungees or
something, this ring seems to


136
0:4:50,54 --> 0:4:54,38
work really, really well,
especially if you have a


137
0:4:54,38 --> 0:4:57,875
little tool that will help
hold it in place.


138
0:4:57,875 --> 0:4:58,99
It's called a hammer.


139
0:4:58,99 --> 0:5:3,9
[BANGING]


140
0:5:3,9 --> 0:5:4,89
If you don't like to blow smoke
rings, just invite your


141
0:5:4,89 --> 0:5:7,54
friends over and listen
to the song.


142
0:5:7,54 --> 0:5:8,79
[BANGING]


143
0:5:8,79 --> 0:5:11,45
Go for the smoke rings.


144
0:5:11,45 --> 0:5:12,49
Time to trim.


145
0:5:12,49 --> 0:5:16,29
Just cut off the excess all the
way around to make it look


146
0:5:16,29 --> 0:5:17,88
nice and clean.


147
0:5:17,88 --> 0:5:22,61
And you'll have yourself the
perfect smoke ring launcher.


148
0:5:22,61 --> 0:5:23,84
The bucket's not empty.


149
0:5:23,84 --> 0:5:26,12
It's actually filled with air.


150
0:5:26,12 --> 0:5:28,7
And that air can easily
be pushed out.


151
0:5:28,7 --> 0:5:32,46
Now, you could take your hand
and just push it this way.


152
0:5:32,46 --> 0:5:34,18
We want a way to be able
to see the air.


153
0:5:34,18 --> 0:5:36,12
That's where this little
device comes in.


154
0:5:36,12 --> 0:5:38,3
See, it's a smoke machine.


155
0:5:38,3 --> 0:5:40,19
Now, you can find them on sale
right after Halloween.


156
0:5:40,19 --> 0:5:43,12
You just need a small little
blast inside here to help


157
0:5:43,12 --> 0:5:44,37
color the air.


158
0:5:44,37 --> 0:5:48,229



159
0:5:48,229 --> 0:5:50,88
See, that little bit of smoke
that's inside there is exactly


160
0:5:50,88 --> 0:5:53,42
what you need, because when you
tap on the bottom, watch


161
0:5:53,42 --> 0:5:55,3
what happens.


162
0:5:55,3 --> 0:5:56,57
There's your vortex.


163
0:5:56,57 --> 0:6:0,46
But unlike the cup, these
go really, really far.


164
0:6:0,46 --> 0:6:1,71
You can hit them pretty hard.


165
0:6:1,71 --> 0:6:7,36



166
0:6:7,36 --> 0:6:7,92
I know what you're thinking.


167
0:6:7,92 --> 0:6:9,86
You want something that's
more patriotic.


168
0:6:9,86 --> 0:6:10,71
You want it bigger.


169
0:6:10,71 --> 0:6:11,89
You want it colored.


170
0:6:11,89 --> 0:6:13,65
You want it--


171
0:6:13,65 --> 0:6:15,3
I've got an idea.


172
0:6:15,3 --> 0:6:17,36
See, you've got all of this
leftover shower curtain.


173
0:6:17,36 --> 0:6:20,366
Now you just need
a bigger bucket.


174
0:6:20,366 --> 0:6:22,91
So you just take the rest of
the shower curtain, and you


175
0:6:22,91 --> 0:6:25,23
put it right over the
bucket like this.


176
0:6:25,23 --> 0:6:27,57
Now we have to secure
it in place.


177
0:6:27,57 --> 0:6:31,9
That's where these bungee
cords come in.


178
0:6:31,9 --> 0:6:32,95
Pull it down, stretch
it tight.


179
0:6:32,95 --> 0:6:34,94
Now this is not just a
smoke ring launcher.


180
0:6:34,94 --> 0:6:36,65
It's a patriotic smoke
ring launcher.


181
0:6:36,65 --> 0:6:38,77
It's Fourth of July!


182
0:6:38,77 --> 0:6:40,3
See, this is the kind of
activity that's going to make


183
0:6:40,3 --> 0:6:41,63
your neighbors proud.


184
0:6:41,63 --> 0:6:44,73
Nothing says America more than
a giant trash can with a


185
0:6:44,73 --> 0:6:47,97
shower curtain stretched over
the top and some bungee cords


186
0:6:47,97 --> 0:6:51,6
and a couple smoke bombs.


187
0:6:51,6 --> 0:6:51,71
That's right.


188
0:6:51,71 --> 0:6:53,5
I said smoke bombs.


189
0:6:53,5 --> 0:6:55,33
You can't just drop smoke
bombs in the trash can.


190
0:6:55,33 --> 0:6:58,37
It'll shoot out molten
smoke bomb stuff.


191
0:6:58,37 --> 0:7:0,3
And then all of a sudden the
trash can's on fire.


192
0:7:0,3 --> 0:7:1,51
You've ruined the day.


193
0:7:1,51 --> 0:7:3,77
So I came up with this
little idea.


194
0:7:3,77 --> 0:7:6,24
Now, you don't have to use
this kind of paint can.


195
0:7:6,24 --> 0:7:7,76
You can use just an
old coffee can.


196
0:7:7,76 --> 0:7:9,1
But we are going to
make a smoker.


197
0:7:9,1 --> 0:7:13,8



198
0:7:13,8 --> 0:7:17,52
See, we're just putting some
holes in this little can so


199
0:7:17,52 --> 0:7:21,28
the smoke bomb can live in here
and just have smoke come


200
0:7:21,28 --> 0:7:23,575
out and trap everything
else inside.


201
0:7:23,575 --> 0:7:27,85



202
0:7:27,85 --> 0:7:29,4
So how many holes?


203
0:7:29,4 --> 0:7:32,665
Just until the neighbors
tell you to stop.


204
0:7:32,665 --> 0:7:33,1
All right.


205
0:7:33,1 --> 0:7:34,24
So here's the idea.


206
0:7:34,24 --> 0:7:36,38
See, the smoke bomb goes
down inside like this.


207
0:7:36,38 --> 0:7:38,83
And now you light it.


208
0:7:38,83 --> 0:7:39,45
Perfect.


209
0:7:39,45 --> 0:7:41,91
And now this goes on top.


210
0:7:41,91 --> 0:7:46,18
And it just keeps all of the
shards from coming out.


211
0:7:46,18 --> 0:7:47,905
And it just oozes smoke.


212
0:7:47,905 --> 0:7:50,84



213
0:7:50,84 --> 0:7:52,81
This is the smoke ring launcher
I've used in my act


214
0:7:52,81 --> 0:7:54,27
for almost 20 years.


215
0:7:54,27 --> 0:7:56,8
But I never use this kind
of smoke on stage.


216
0:7:56,8 --> 0:7:58,76
Of course, we're just using
a smoke machine.


217
0:7:58,76 --> 0:8:0,71
So this one, you just have to
make sure that you cut the


218
0:8:0,71 --> 0:8:4,99
hole just a little bit bigger
than the paint can so it


219
0:8:4,99 --> 0:8:6,5
covers it perfectly.


220
0:8:6,5 --> 0:8:6,82
All right.


221
0:8:6,82 --> 0:8:8,61
We're ready for patriotic
rings of smoke.


222
0:8:8,61 --> 0:8:11,4
Smoke bomb down inside.


223
0:8:11,4 --> 0:8:12,24
Beautiful.


224
0:8:12,24 --> 0:8:14,49
Lid on top like this.


225
0:8:14,49 --> 0:8:17,18
Smoke starts to come out,
you simply cover it up.


226
0:8:17,18 --> 0:8:19,19
See, this is the only way that
you can get this beautifully


227
0:8:19,19 --> 0:8:20,32
colored smoke.


228
0:8:20,32 --> 0:8:21,81
This is perfect.


229
0:8:21,81 --> 0:8:22,8
Now watch.


230
0:8:22,8 --> 0:8:26,46
As it lifts up, watch this.


231
0:8:26,46 --> 0:8:30,32
You get these beautiful
smoke rings.


232
0:8:30,32 --> 0:8:31,19
Wake the kids.


233
0:8:31,19 --> 0:8:32,52
Call the neighbors.


234
0:8:32,52 --> 0:8:32,82
Oh, wait.


235
0:8:32,82 --> 0:8:34,7
That's David Letterman.


236
0:8:34,7 --> 0:8:38,189



237
0:8:38,189 --> 0:8:39,95
What if you could use science
to help you serve


238
0:8:39,95 --> 0:8:41,61
food at your party?


239
0:8:41,61 --> 0:8:42,22
I got it.


240
0:8:42,22 --> 0:8:43,49
Watch this.


241
0:8:43,49 --> 0:8:45,68
And just because you've seen
Mentos and Diet Coke does not


242
0:8:45,68 --> 0:8:47,39
mean that you've got to turn
it off at this point.


243
0:8:47,39 --> 0:8:48,39
This is different.


244
0:8:48,39 --> 0:8:48,57
Watch.


245
0:8:48,57 --> 0:8:50,36
First of all, we need
a dropper device.


246
0:8:50,36 --> 0:8:51,66
And I've got to show
you this one.


247
0:8:51,66 --> 0:8:54,37
This is clear plastic so you
can see what's going on.


248
0:8:54,37 --> 0:8:54,85
But watch this.


249
0:8:54,85 --> 0:8:57,7
There's a magnet that goes on
the side here, and a ball


250
0:8:57,7 --> 0:8:59,335
bearing that comes down here.


251
0:8:59,335 --> 0:9:1,61
See how it holds in
place like this?


252
0:9:1,61 --> 0:9:2,155
That's perfect.


253
0:9:2,155 --> 0:9:4,71
So when you pull, then
everything falls at once.


254
0:9:4,71 --> 0:9:8,15
Next, the contraption goes
on the top like this.


255
0:9:8,15 --> 0:9:12,14
And now we drop the Mentos.


256
0:9:12,14 --> 0:9:15,18
See, we're just hoping that
that magnet and that ball


257
0:9:15,18 --> 0:9:16,23
bearing holds everything
in place.


258
0:9:16,23 --> 0:9:17,48
And so far, so good.


259
0:9:17,48 --> 0:9:19,36
If we just pulled this right
now, it'd be bad because it


260
0:9:19,36 --> 0:9:20,19
ruins the kitchen.


261
0:9:20,19 --> 0:9:22,35
That's why you need to make
this simple little


262
0:9:22,35 --> 0:9:26,36
contraption, called the Super
Soda Dispenser 3000.


263
0:9:26,36 --> 0:9:29,1
So you see, it just goes over
the very top like this.


264
0:9:29,1 --> 0:9:32,11
And the last thing you need,
six of your best friends.


265
0:9:32,11 --> 0:9:34,26
So you're going to have limit
it to six, but these are my


266
0:9:34,26 --> 0:9:35,49
six best friends.


267
0:9:35,49 --> 0:9:37,18
Anybody else?


268
0:9:37,18 --> 0:9:38,172
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is it.


269
0:9:38,172 --> 0:9:39,59
MALE SPEAKER: This is it.


270
0:9:39,59 --> 0:9:40,93
I'm going to pull this.


271
0:9:40,93 --> 0:9:42,13
And it's going to drop down.


272
0:9:42,13 --> 0:9:45,32
And hopefully, this is how we're
going to bring in this


273
0:9:45,32 --> 0:9:47,552
exciting time of the year.


274
0:9:47,552 --> 0:9:49,456
MALE SPEAKER: Rad.


275
0:9:49,456 --> 0:9:50,706
STEVE SPANGLER: Ready?


276
0:9:50,706 --> 0:9:53,27



277
0:9:53,27 --> 0:9:53,72
Bam!


278
0:9:53,72 --> 0:9:54,21
FEMALE SPEAKER: Nice.


279
0:9:54,21 --> 0:9:55,0
STEVE SPANGLER: Look at that.


280
0:9:55,0 --> 0:9:58,13
It's a soda dispenser,
and it's perfect.


281
0:9:58,13 --> 0:10:0,33
But you don't want to waste
it all on one person.


282
0:10:0,33 --> 0:10:3,49
That's why we only give each
person a little taste.


283
0:10:3,49 --> 0:10:4,17
Here you go.


284
0:10:4,17 --> 0:10:5,19
Some for you.


285
0:10:5,19 --> 0:10:6,43
And some for you.


286
0:10:6,43 --> 0:10:8,55
Cheers to science
Fourth of July.


287
0:10:8,55 --> 0:10:8,925
FEMALE SPEAKER: Cheers!


288
0:10:8,925 --> 0:10:11,48
MALE SPEAKER: Cheers.


289
0:10:11,48 --> 0:10:13,31
STEVE SPANGLER: Well, now that
you've got an awesome drink,


290
0:10:13,31 --> 0:10:15,5
and you've got all your friends
here, and you've got


291
0:10:15,5 --> 0:10:17,96
smoke rings, you're ready for
the big finale, patriotic


292
0:10:17,96 --> 0:10:20,91
geysers with all your friends.


293
0:10:20,91 --> 0:10:22,36
Where'd she go?


294
0:10:22,36 --> 0:10:23,286
MALE SPEAKER: She took off.


295
0:10:23,286 --> 0:10:25,77



296
0:10:25,77 --> 0:10:27,7
STEVE SPANGLER: Well, here we
are for the big finale.


297
0:10:27,7 --> 0:10:29,3
I set this up first thing
this morning.


298
0:10:29,3 --> 0:10:30,57
And I've been waiting
all day for it.


299
0:10:30,57 --> 0:10:34,28
You're going to want to get
your phone out for this.


300
0:10:34,28 --> 0:10:35,97
I've got three different
sodas.


301
0:10:35,97 --> 0:10:38,74
And I've colored this one red
and this one white, of course.


302
0:10:38,74 --> 0:10:39,96
This is clear, and
this one's blue.


303
0:10:39,96 --> 0:10:42,295
And now when I pull this, the
Mentos are going to fall.


304
0:10:42,295 --> 0:10:44,1
And like every great geyser,
it's going to


305
0:10:44,1 --> 0:10:44,7
shoot up in the air.


306
0:10:44,7 --> 0:10:46,75
It's going to be this patriotic
kind of color of


307
0:10:46,75 --> 0:10:47,95
red, white, and blue.


308
0:10:47,95 --> 0:10:48,49
You're going to want to go--


309
0:10:48,49 --> 0:10:49,41
MALE SPEAKER: I've got to go.


310
0:10:49,41 --> 0:10:49,63
STEVE SPANGLER: No.


311
0:10:49,63 --> 0:10:50,3
Don't go.


312
0:10:50,3 --> 0:10:51,4
This is going to be awesome.


313
0:10:51,4 --> 0:10:52,68
I'm going to pull these strings,
and it's going to be


314
0:10:52,68 --> 0:10:53,942
like in the sky.


315
0:10:53,942 --> 0:10:55,71
MALE SPEAKER: I've
got to head out.


316
0:10:55,71 --> 0:10:56,65
Thanks for the soda.


317
0:10:56,65 --> 0:10:58,13
STEVE SPANGLER: You can pull
a string if you want.


318
0:10:58,13 --> 0:11:0,29
Just take your camera.


319
0:11:0,29 --> 0:11:0,8
Watch this.


320
0:11:0,8 --> 0:11:1,89
It's going to be--
hey, watch this.


321
0:11:1,89 --> 0:11:2,35
It's really cool.


322
0:11:2,35 --> 0:11:2,65
Watch this.


323
0:11:2,65 --> 0:11:3,7
Watch.


324
0:11:3,7 --> 0:11:5,6
Three, two, one, go!


325
0:11:5,6 --> 0:11:6,23
Watch this!


326
0:11:6,23 --> 0:11:7,582
Ta da!


327
0:11:7,582 --> 0:11:9,62
Look at that !


328
0:11:9,62 --> 0:11:12,56
Happy Fourth of July,
everyone!


329
0:11:12,56 --> 0:11:14,91
See, you missed it.


330
0:11:14,91 --> 0:11:16,432
It was awesome.


331
0:11:16,432 --> 0:11:18,2
This is the best year ever!


332
0:11:18,2 --> 0:11:21,12
Thanks for coming, everyone.


333
0:11:21,12 --> 0:11:23,74
Next year I'm going
to do six geysers!


334
0:11:23,74 --> 0:11:25,42
Not just three, six.


335
0:11:25,42 --> 0:11:27,31
I'm going to have some more
sodas and smoke rings.


336
0:11:27,31 --> 0:11:30,46



337
0:11:30,46 --> 0:11:31,84
I don't know why he had
to leave so early.


338
0:11:31,84 --> 0:11:34,96



339
0:11:34,96 --> 0:11:36,7
Honey?


340
0:11:36,7 --> 0:11:37,66
Bring the kids out.


341
0:11:37,66 --> 0:11:40,63
I got more geysers.


342

344
0:11:42,174 --> 0:11:55,83



345
0:11:55,83 --> 0:11:57,36
The oldest trick in the book,
ladies and gentlemen.


346
0:11:57,36 --> 0:12:0,42
Three pieces of dry ice
and three Solo cups.


347
0:12:0,42 --> 0:12:1,42
One on the top.


348
0:12:1,42 --> 0:12:1,85
Boop, boop.


349
0:12:1,85 --> 0:12:2,5
Look at this.


350
0:12:2,5 --> 0:12:3,14
Goes right through.


351
0:12:3,14 --> 0:12:3,84
It's magic.


352
0:12:3,84 --> 0:12:5,25
But hey, I'll do it again.


353
0:12:5,25 --> 0:12:8,2
That's another piece of dry ice
here, right on the top.


354
0:12:8,2 --> 0:12:8,64
Watch this.


355
0:12:8,64 --> 0:12:9,11
Boop, boop.


356
0:12:9,11 --> 0:12:11,4
And that thing goes
right through it.


357
0:12:11,4 --> 0:12:11,97
Check that out.


358
0:12:11,97 --> 0:12:12,44
It's OK.


359
0:12:12,44 --> 0:12:13,86
I'm amazed myself.


360
0:12:13,86 --> 0:12:14,48
Watch this one.


361
0:12:14,48 --> 0:12:15,47
The third one is magic.


362
0:12:15,47 --> 0:12:16,52
It's going to go through
this way.


363
0:12:16,52 --> 0:12:17,45
Bam, bam.


364
0:12:17,45 --> 0:12:19,31
Bam!


365
