###10 RB UMALI: Josh's personality back then, you could tell he
###13 came from a tough background.
###14 He had a lot of tough family issues that he dealt with.
###18 And he had a funny way of just telling stories about
###21 his past and stuff.
###22 And I didn't know whether to believe him or not.
###24 JOSH KALLIS: When I went to live back with my dad in
###27 Dallas, we didn't get along at all.
###30 I was doing my thing in the city of Dallas, hanging out
###32 with these dudes who were not necessarily
###35 gangsters, but kind of.
###38 But they were skaters.
###39 And I fell right into that mix.
###42 Around that time, I got locked up in this mental institution
###46 for six or seven months.
###49 I got caught stealing.
###51 And they took me to jail for stealing.
###54 And I was in there for two days.
###56 And this bounty hunter dude in a full suit--
###61 he was almost albino--
###63 took me out of the jail.
###64 He pulls out a 9 millimeter and he says, hey, state of
###67 Texas says I can do anything in my power to
###69 keep you from running.
###70 So don't run.
###71 It's like, all right.
###72 So on the way down there he had me filling out all these
###75 crazy psych forms, like, do you study license plates, and
###79 just crazy questions.
###81 So I got put in this institution where there was
###84 all these murderers who got out on whatever.
###87 They were like fucked up in the brain.
###89 So instead of going to prison, they went here.
###91 No shoestrings, no belts, big magnet locks on the doors.
###96 They take my blood every couple days.
###98 And I would go in to these counseling sessions and they'd
###100 be like, so what are you doing here?
###102 Johnny, Timmy, they all killed somebody.
###103 He raped four girls.
###105 Blah, blah, blah.
###105 And they'd come to me and I'd be like, I don't fucking know.
###108 You guys are all fucking psycho.
###111 One day I ran out of toilet paper.
###113 And you walk up to the lady.
###115 She had to go back into the closet.
###117 So when she went back into the closet, her little desk phone,
###119 I picked it up, hit nine, and dialed my mom.
###122 My mom answered screaming at me.
###125 I told her I was in Salt Lake City at some place.
###127 And I ended up waking up in a closet.
###130 They hit me from behind with some drugs.
###133 So whatever.
###135 You move forward.
###136 And bounty hunter came, scooped me up, says, all
###140 right, you're on a plane back to Dallas.
###142 And he says that what it was was my dad did it.
###145 He thought I was this fucked up kid.
###149 And he hired this dude to get me.
###150 And then his insurance company paid for it.
###153 And shit, I'd've been in there six years.
###156 But I got out in six months.
###158 And when I got out, the H Street thing just wasn't even
###161 an option for me.
###162 The girl I would call to get the boxes and all that stuff,
###165 when I called her she was like, yeah, Tony said no.
###170 Josh is out.
###171 So skating was almost done for me.
###174 I didn't give a shit, dude.
###176 I didn't have a board.
###177 I didn't have none of that.
###178 And I didn't care.
###180 I got back with my homies.
###182 I told my dad, fuck him, like, fuck you, I
###184 know the whole story.
###185 I don't want to have nothing to do with you anymore.
###188 And I went to Dallas.
###189 And I just hung out with my friends.
###190 And we lived in North Dallas, just hood.
###195 I mean, it was cockroaches and gangsters.
###199 It was crazy.
###200 And it wasn't until I heard these rumors that Jamie Thomas
###203 was coming in to Dallas--
###206 shit, I hadn't even skated in six or seven months.
###210 JAMIE THOMAS: I was traveling across the United States with
###212 some buddies.
###213 And at that time I rode for Invisible.
###215 And we went through Dallas, Texas, and I don't know how I
###219 even linked up with him.
###220 But I think I heard he lived in Dallas.
###222 JOSH KALLIS: Jamie was like, you got a board?
###225 I said, nah.
###226 And he hooked me up.
###226 He gave me an Invisible board and took me to the skate shop
###230 and got some trucks.
###231 And I got a set up.
###232 
###238 JAMIE THOMAS: We went skating that day,
###239 and it was just like--
###240 I was filming him, and he was just seriously so good.
###245 At that time it was obvious he was way better
###247 than a lot of people.
###248 And he was definitely good enough to be
###249 sponsored by whoever.
###251 But he was just hanging out with these gang banger dudes
###255 in Dallas, super thug dudes that-- they were super cool
###258 and stuff, but it was just a whole other life.
###261 There was nothing about skating.
###262 Even though all the dudes in his clique used to skate and
###265 were skaters, they were more about being thug hustlers than
###270 they were skaters.
###271 
###274 It was obvious that he didn't have a real stable
###276 situation going on.
###278 I think he was living with his dad at the time, but I don't
###281 even know if he was staying with his dad.
###282 He was probably maybe just 18 then.
###289 It was insane.
###290 Right then I was like, wow, this is one of the best kids
###292 I've ever seen skate.
###293 He's so good.
###295 JOSH KALLIS: All I know is we skated that weekend, and I
###301 filmed, I don't know, like two minutes of probably the best
###306 skateboarding I've ever done in my life to this day.
###309 
###317 JAMIE THOMAS: I remember he filmed a line that was like a
###320 minute long.
###320 It was the most flat ground tricks I'd ever seen anybody
###322 do in a row before.
###323 And he did them all in a line.
###324 
###327 At that point I was just like, hey, man.
###330 I wasn't running Invisible or nothing, but I was just like,
###332 hey, if you want to ride for this company, I'm sure I can
###334 figure out a way to make it happen.
###336 He probably didn't even know in his mind if he was going to
###338 continue skating or not after I left.
###340 
###342 But if he got free stuff showing up in the mail, he was
###345 either going to be able to skate it, sell it, whatever.
###347 It was going to be something.
###348 So I left, got home, and then lined up a package and started
###351 sending him stuff.
###353 JOSH KALLIS: Jamie called me up, and he--
###355 oh yeah, I forgot about this part.
###357 This was my very first tour.
###359 He called me up.
###359 He said, hey, man, we're doing an Invisible tour.
###361 Why don't you jump in the van?
###366 So OK.
###368 So I on the van, but Jamie wasn't there.
###369 Jamie had quit Invisible just as I was going on this
###373 Invisible tour.
###374 So I went on the tour anyway.
###376 JAMIE THOMAS: He went on the tour with those dudes, and
###377 they just went trucking across the US.
###379 And then basically I called him when I got on Toy Machine.
###382 He was back in Dallas.
###384 Basically Ed was like, hey man, you down to help me
###386 rebuild the team?
###387 And I was like, sure.
###387 You got any guys you want?
###389 And he was like, no, not really.
###392 But if you want to figure something out or get some guys
###395 on the team, I'd be psyched.
###396 So I started with Kallis.
###397 Basically he was one of the dudes.
###399 
###402 JOSH KALLIS: I went back to doing my Dallas hood shit,
###406 skating a little bit.
###407 A couple months later he got a hold of me, and
###409 he's like, hey man.
###411 Dudes are really fucking hyped on your footage.
###416 I don't know where he put it, but he was like, dude, if you
###418 can get out here, I'll let you live at my house.
###422 You just have to get out here.
###424 I didn't know how I was going to do it.
###426 I made a little bit of money just hustling kids and betting
###430 on Mortal Kombat.
###431 And we had this dude who would work a full-time job, and me
###434 and my homie would just take his check and pay ourselves.
###439 My dad told me $350 for gas and he'd fly me out.
###443 But he owned one of them little Cessna planes.
###446 So I went to California on a Cessna airplane with nothing
###450 but what I was wearing and touched down.
###453 Jamie picked me up.
###455 Then it moves on to the Riviera PB.
###458 Jamie Thomas, Alien House.
###460 Where do I hang out?
###462 I hang out at the Alien House, because they drink 40s and
###465 play dominoes.
###467 And it was tight.
###469
