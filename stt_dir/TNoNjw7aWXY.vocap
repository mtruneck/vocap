###9 DAMIAN SANDERS: Life is about taking risks.
###10 If you don't take risks, why even live?
###12 What fun is it to walk around on a rubber world and be
###15 afraid of everything?
###16 You got to out there and try to outdo people, because then
###19 it's progression of the world.
###21 It makes it more fun to live.
###23 You got to go big, and the next guy is going to to try to
###25 go bigger, and that's what it's all about.
###26 JERRY DUGAN: Damian was one of the most comfortable people in
###29 the air for sure at that point and probably to this day.
###33 I mean he just had a sense about him in the air where he
###36 was just totally comfortable up there.
###38 DON SZABO: Damian was real influential, and go, go, go on
###42 building jumps and having fun and getting footage and just
###46 riding, you know.
###47 We just loved to ride.
###48 TOM BURT: Damian Sanders was so much fun to watch because
###51 he had just incredible style in the air.
###54 Pretty much no one touched his style for years.
###57 When the video realm came in, it was kind of like Damian was
###61 on top of that.
###62 KEVIN ENGLISH: There's this one shot in "Snowboarders in
###64 Exile" where the camera's real low, and it's looking at
###67 Damian, and he's just pointing up, and that's how I felt.
###69 It was like that's Damian.
###72 DAVE SEOANE: Well, the first time I saw Damian, I was
###74 actually still in high school.
###75 And I knew Damian from--
###77 he lived near where I grew up in an area
###79 called Calaveras County.
###80 And he had a big quarter pipe at his house which is like a
###84 half hour away so we'd skate.
###86 And then the first time I saw him snowboarding was in Iron
###88 Mountain in probably '85.
###90 And I remember they were all riding these Avalanche
###91 snowboards, and they were kind of really like really stiff
###93 ironing boards.
###95 I watched Damian ride down the hill, and he grabbed the lift
###97 tower, and he grabbed it, and he spun around 360 like a
###100 couple inches off the ground.
###101 I was like, wow, he's so good.
###104 That guy's spectacular.
###105 He's got good hair.
###107 I think he was just like the city kid who moved to the
###110 hills, and so he had spiky, blond hair
###114 and spider web eyeliner.
###116 So Damian learned how to fight really quick.
###121 DAMIAN SANDERS: I was moving from San Jose where I lived as
###122 a city boy kid, skateboarder and stuff, and I was young, 13
###125 years old, and we were moving up to Bear Valley.
###128 And I wanted to buy a Burton snowboard, it was the only
###130 snowboard company that even existed, or that I
###131 knew about back then.
###133 And my brother told my mom to hold off because he was going
###135 to make a snowboard.
###135 He had a little wood shop going, and sure enough I got
###138 that snowboard, the first one he ever made, the first
###139 Avalanche ever in '83.
###141 We went up to the local mountain.
###142 I made about six or eight turns on my first run ever
###145 just in the powder, just bouncing turns, and was
###147 flipping my lid, thinking it was the
###148 best thing ever invented.
###149 There was a competition at Soda Springs, the world
###152 championships, and this has would have been about '85.
###154 And I didn't even know there was other snowboarders in the
###156 world, let alone have a world championship.
###158 So I went over to that, and I remember walking around the
###160 corner from the parking lot, and I saw about 50 boards
###162 lined up in front of this lodge, and I
###164 about shit my pants.
###165 I couldn't believe there was 50 other
###166 snowboarders in the world.
###167 And so I went into the lodge and everybody's all the same
###170 type of people, these surf rat looking guys, skaters.
###172 Back then, if you snowboarded and somebody else snowboard,
###174 you were instantly friends because there
###176 was so few of us.
###177 I had way more balls than brains back then, so I would
###181 hit any jump just for people to go, holy shit, you see that
###183 kid fly off that jump.
###184 I had a little, white mohawk, and I just dressed like a
###187 little new wave fag.
###189 So I was hitting all the jumps I could, and just to show off,
###192 I would break my neck to show off, and sure enough I ended
###194 up in the hospital on that Soda Springs competition, but
###197 it was pretty fun doing it.
###199 MIKE MCENTIRE: Damian was one of the most ballsiest people
###202 that's ever been involved in snowboarding.
###205 To this day, you can look back at his footage from like
###207 20-plus years ago, and it's fully legit.
###211 The guy was jumping off 60-foot cliffs for fun.
###215 And I would go up and riding at Squaw, and I'd just be
###218 taking runs with my boys and look up, and there's Damian
###221 popping off mainline going like 50 feet
###223 for the hell of it.
###224 And you're like, damn dude, what's up with that guy, he's
###229 freaking nuts.
###231 I saw him bust out some stuff, no cameras, just
###235 gigantic, for fun.
###237 That's killer, man.
###238 I love that.
###238 That just shows you where it's in someone's heart, you know.
###242 SPEAKER: What do you think the silliest
###243 snowboarding trick is?
###245 
###248 DAMIAN SANDERS: Every trick I did last year.
###251 When people started flipping that was a huge deal.
###253 The first flips ever, we were all on this little jump exit,
###255 Donner Ski Ranch.
###256 It was right underneath the chairlift, and it was like a
###257 little ski jump kicker.
###258 I think it was Steve Graham and myself.
###260 Steve was a nut.
###261 He would do anything any time.
###263 I remember trying it over and over again, and doing 3/4 of a
###266 flip so many times, just clearing my head, and smacking
###268 the snow again and again.
###269 And then finally one time they came all around, landed on my
###271 feet, and I about shit myself.
###272 I'm still standing!
###274 Rode away from it and then started getting bigger and
###277 bigger, and then I started laying them out, and then once
###278 you can lay it out and control your spin, then you'd sit
###280 there upside down, and go do I want to pull around yet.
###282 And then you can do it off of anything.
###284 So I was hucking huge airs off of cliffs or huge kickers, and
###287 just stalling it out in the air, and grabbing the board
###288 and, poking it, and just looking down on at the ground.
###291 Back then it was so cool because no one could do it.
###293 Now it would be nothing, but it was cool at the time.
###296 There was guys that could flip before I could, but nobody was
###299 grabbing their board or anything.
###300 I think I invented the iguana back flip and some other
###302 things where I was trying to grab different ways upside
###304 down, and that was like after doing flips for almost a year.
###308 KEVIN ENGLISH: Damien, Squaw Valley, doing massive iguana
###311 back flips, and it was ridiculous.
###315 TODD RICHARDS: For a while, he was full grabbing wherever,
###318 like back here, but you couldn't even say shit because
###320 Damien was going 10 times bigger than anybody else.
###324 I still say that today.
###325 Like if you're going 25 feet out of the half pipe and you
###329 just happen to just do the wackest grab, we'd be like,
###334 oh, that's gay.
###335 The dude is still going way bigger than you'll ever go,
###338 and it's insane.
###339 At some point, you're just like, who gives a shit.
###342 STEVE GRAHAM: Damian was always my favorite rider.
###344 I still wish he was riding now.
###346 I'd love to ride with him.
###348 My funnest times ever riding was back in the early days in
###352 Tahoe just chasing Damian, and we were just a couple idiots
###357 that wouldn't look at anything.
###358 Just, what do you think?
###359 Oh yeah, [INAUDIBLE].
###361 No landing, no woo-hoo.
###363 And just we pulled that off for awhile.
###368 I don't know how I'm still even walking.
###369 I was taller.
###370 The scariest time I've ever had snowboarding is really any
###375 day we'd go riding with Damian 'cause if there's anyone
###379 [INAUDIBLE] that.
###382 He's going the biggest, the highest, the fastest and
###387 pushes you.
###388 DAMIAN SANDERS: I'd have to say Steve Graham was probably
###390 my favorite of all time because he was such a badass
###392 rider, and he would do anything at any time, hucking
###395 off of cliffs and stuff, and he really pushed me.
###397 He pushed me more than anybody ever did in snowboarding.
###399 We saw things different than other people did because we
###401 were both at the same talent caliber.
###404 We could see how you could hit a jump and fly 80 feet over
###406 there and land on the downhill.
###407 It was something else that nobody else could see because
###409 it was just out of their realm, and I had more fun
###412 riding with him than anybody because of that.
###414 DAVE SEOANE: I think that Steve Graham is a total
###415 catalyst to Damian because both those guys were kind of
###418 out of their minds, where I think Damian had a lot more
###420 control of what he was doing, and Steve just went for it,
###423 shoot first, ask questions later type of
###425 personality back then.
###427 And so those two together, that's where I think the sport
###431 really got pushed, with those two guys jumping off of things
###433 and flipping off of everything really big.
###437 Yeah, I guess that's the biggest thing I
###438 was influenced by.
###439 
###441 KEVIN ENGLISH: For like personal style?
###443 It was like, Damian was the guy, just
###446 because he was so unique.
###447 My hair was fully blond, Damian style fauxhawk kind of
###452 thing going, and then I'd take the hair spray and get it to
###455 go straight up, and I'd do this before
###457 I'd ride every day.
###459 I'd look in the mirror, and I'd be like yeah, Damian,
###462 that's pretty sick.
###463 I saw how Damian wrote his name in all capital letters.
###466 It was just Damian, that's all it was, so I started signing
###470 my name that way.
###472 I'd say he influenced me a little when I was a kid.
###476 DAMIAN SANDERS: Getting all that popularity was so fun
###477 back then especially when you're young.
###478 You're in your early '20s or late teens, and everybody
###481 knows your name, and everybody's,
###482 can I get your autograph?
###483 TODD RICHARDS: Damian was a spectacle.
###485 In all those movies, he was the dude out back flipping the
###488 landing, landing would just, [WHOOSHING SOUND], be gone.
###491 He'd land out on the flats or go bigger than anybody.
###493 He had the Penthouse chick, was his girlfriend, and she
###499 was always naked, and he was always trying to show you
###501 pictures of her without her clothes on, and he had the
###504 stupid hair, and he had a posse of weird dudes dressed
###508 in black that may or may not have been women, I don't know.
###510 It was just like weird weirdness, but that was
###513 Damian, and it was just like, oh, here comes Damian.
###515 
###517 TOM BURT: He's definitely set himself out from the crowd.
###520 He had his Billy Idol hairdo and his headband, but that's
###524 just what was going on, neon was in at that time.
###528 Damian was the guy you wanted in your house to have over for
###531 dinner because he's going to do the dishes before he
###532 leaves, but his image might not have
###536 shown that to the public.
###539 DAMIAN SANDERS: Back then, snowboard
###540 clothes barely existed.
###541 And it was like we were wearing anything that we
###543 either we got off the street that we wore to a nightclub,
###545 or we would wear leather jackets with
###547 logos on the back.
###548 It was pretty funny.
###550 And anything that mixed with ski gear because there was no
###553 such thing as snowboard company or snowboard gear yet.
###555 STEVE GRAHAM: I don't know, I think Damian kind of liked a
###558 couple of pieces more than he lets you on.
###562 Like in "Exile," he was wearing that one, it was like
###565 four colors.
###565 It was amazingly painful, but I don't know, it was
###570 just at that time.
###572 '89 was just neon, and I see it come back like neon tie
###579 dye, and just two things I really love.
###586 TODD RICHARDS: We need someone like Damian in the industry
###588 still, especially someone that's got that much flair,
###593 and he's out there, but at the same time, he could get along
###597 with anyone's grandparents as soon as they got over the fact
###599 that he had a freaking mohawk, he's just a nice dude.
###603 DAMIAN SANDERS: Funny story about how Dana Nicholson and
###605 Jeff Miles and I met.
###606 I was with Palmer on the lift, and we're cruising up, and I
###608 see these two guys in leather jackets, black
###610 pants, and red berets.
###612 They looked like total LA gangster type guys, and it was
###616 so funny, gangsters back in the day with a little bit of
###618 fashion to them.
###619 So they're snowboarding underneath me and, I go look
###620 at those guys, those guys are cool.
###622 And Shaun Palmer's all.
###622 What a fag.
###624 And then I snowboard up to them and, oh, how you guys
###626 doing, and they're all hey what's up, and they acted like
###627 they didn't know who I was.
###628 And so we started riding together just 'cause everybody
###630 kind of was friends back then, and come to find out they
###633 traveled from Southern California all the way to this
###635 resort to meet me 'cause they knew I rode there, and they
###638 had seen me in magazines, and they were all we want to ride
###639 with that guy, that guy should be our friend.
###641 And sure enough, I just saw them and go
###643 these guys are cool.
###644 So the rest was history.
###645 We ended up being friends for 25 years now.
###648 The three of us have never left each other's sides.
###650 We travelled the world like that.
###651 DANA NICHOLSON: You look like a little kid.
###652 DAMIAN SANDERS: Like a little girl.
###653 [LAUGHTER]
###655 DAMIAN SANDERS: I was probably 19, 18.
###656 No I didn't even learn to drive yet.
###657 DANA NICHOLSON: Nah, nah, you were 16 right there dude.
###659 DAMIAN SANDERS: 16 and I didn't know how to drive.
###660 DANA NICHOLSON: Look at you.
###660 You look like a fruit loop right there, look.
###663 I got--
###663 DAMIAN SANDERS: Pink pants!
###664 DANA NICHOLSON: I got pink pants on, but he looks like a
###666 fruit loop.
###668 DAMIAN SANDERS: Look at that, look.
###669 Holy shit, that's Dana.
###670 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###670 DAMIAN SANDERS: 20 years ago.
###672 Look at your color scheme.
###674 Holy shit.
###676 DANA NICHOLSON: Somebody should've
###677 pulled me aside and--
###678 DAMIAN SANDERS: And look at those gloves, what the fuck am
###679 I wearing, Mr. Roboto.
###680 [LAUGHTER]
###682 DANA NICHOLSON: Holy shit, look at those things, Jesus.
###686 DAMIAN SANDERS: Look at this outfit.
###687 DANA NICHOLSON: Look at that shit.
###687 DAMIAN SANDERS: That's some good-looking clothes.
###688 DANA NICHOLSON: Yeah, that's solid.
###690 Look at your little pink with the white and black fucking
###693 Boy George shit.
###695 [INAUDIBLE]
###695 DAMIAN SANDERS: We were like Wham!
###697 This is at the first competition I ever went to,
###699 when I told you I went to Soda Springs, that's from that
###701 competition, that's my style back then.
###704 Yeah, like no high backs, and there's just little straps
###707 holding my feet on these little piece of shit bindings.
###709 DANA NICHOLSON: That's a frog suit for sure, dude.
###712 Damn.
###712 DAMIAN SANDERS: I don't even know how we came up with this.
###713 What it was, we had racing back in the day, everybody
###715 thought you had to wear these speed suits to race.
###717 You might save a quarter of a second off of your time like
###720 it mattered.
###721 DANA NICHOLSON: Did it work?
###721 DAMIAN SANDERS: No, it never worked.
###723 And what happened is I put this on, and then I had a
###726 shirt or a jacket, and then somebody took a picture of it,
###728 and it ended up in a magazine, and then every single time we
###730 had a photo shoot they were all, could you
###731 wear the green outfit?
###732 That photographed real well.
###734 Fuck, the green outfit again?
###735 That's got a Donner ticket on it.
###738 I was in a photoshoot probably 15 years ago
###740 at Donner Ski Ranch.
###741 DANA NICHOLSON: That's me.
###741 DAMIAN SANDERS: That's Dana.
###742 So we used to have to take our shells off because they were
###744 hard boot shells, and we'd walk around in the inner
###746 liners, and then when you got to the resort, you'd
###747 put your shells on.
###748 DANA NICHOLSON: But the thing is, dude, we'd ride these
###750 ironing boards, and we' killed everybody on the hard boots.
###754 We just crushed them.
###755 DAMIAN SANDERS: When this came out, I remember I was so
###757 pissed, because this was the first time I'd ever grabbed
###758 the board on a back flip, and my leg blocked it.
###761 And so I was all fuck, nobody's gonna know, and back
###763 then it mattered so much what your friends thought about if
###765 you were the first guy to do a grab back flip or something.
###768 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###768 DANA NICHOLSON: We're rocking fucking falling posters.
###769 DAMIAN SANDERS: Falling posters.
###771 I was stoked when this came out.
###772 This ad came out, and it was right across the street.
###775 This was in Carmelo or something, but they had one
###777 right across the street where we were hanging out at the
###778 beach, And we'd go down to the beach, and I'd be like, oh
###780 hey, check it out, over there, look at that billboard.
###782 That's me, baby.
###783 DANA NICHOLSON: That was back in the day.
###785 Some funny shit, dude, seeing this shit again.
###788 DAMIAN SANDERS: Here's where I was trying to be a rock star
###789 for about 10 years there.
###791 That's the necklace I was talking about you could take
###793 off and cut yourself.
###793 DANA NICHOLSON: That was your Danzig thing, huh.
###794 DAMIAN SANDERS: My Danzig necklace.
###795 DANA NICHOLSON: That was your Danzig period.
###797 
###800 DAMIAN SANDERS: God, every outfit's gayer than the last.
###803 DANA NICHOLSON: Yeah, that paid the bills though.
###805 Holy shit.
###806 DAMIAN SANDERS: That hairdo.
###807 And more gay, gay--
###811 DANA NICHOLSON: Look at that.
###812 DAMIAN SANDERS: --super gay.
###813 
###816 Good and Fruity, it's perfect, huh.
###818 [LAUGHTER]
###821
