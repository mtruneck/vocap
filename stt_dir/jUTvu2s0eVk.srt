1
0:0:32,823 --> 0:0:35,98
Enterprise this is Starfleet Operations.


2
0:0:35,98 --> 0:0:37,345
All transfers of materials
and personnel are complete,


3
0:0:37,345 --> 0:0:39,917
your cleared to leave
Earth orbit. Goodnight.


4
0:0:39,917 --> 0:0:43,293
Acknowledged, Enterprise out.


5
0:0:43,293 --> 0:0:57,726
Ensign.


6
0:0:57,726 --> 0:1:0,23
Request permission to come aboard.


7
0:1:0,23 --> 0:1:5,104
Granted.


8
0:1:5,104 --> 0:1:11,772
Lt. Commander Sulu reporting.


9
0:1:11,772 --> 0:1:12,814
Hikaru.


10
0:1:12,814 --> 0:1:14,642
Vincent.


11
0:1:14,642 --> 0:1:16,632
Captain says you can postpone
checking in with him


12
0:1:16,632 --> 0:1:20,15
- until the morning staff meeting.
- Will do.


13
0:1:20,15 --> 0:1:21,421
- How was Earth?
- Nice.


14
0:1:21,421 --> 0:1:25,97
- How's my ship?
- Fine, fine.


15
0:1:25,97 --> 0:1:26,325
You look...


16
0:1:26,325 --> 0:1:28,676
relaxed! Did a lot of relaxing did you?


17
0:1:28,676 --> 0:1:31,42
Not much, command training you know...


18
0:1:31,42 --> 0:1:33,99
Ah, I'd heard.


19
0:1:33,99 --> 0:1:35,659
Training for... command,


20
0:1:35,659 --> 0:1:43,358
Lieutenant.


21
0:1:43,358 --> 0:1:48,26
Sir, Starfleet just signalled with
Commander Sulu's transfer orders.


22
0:1:48,26 --> 0:2:1,985
Thank you... ensign.


23
0:2:1,985 --> 0:2:3,134
Heading sir?


24
0:2:3,134 --> 0:2:5,331
Standby.


25
0:2:5,331 --> 0:2:7,262
I've got new navigator charts.


26
0:2:7,262 --> 0:2:9,452
New ones? Have the stars moved?


27
0:2:9,452 --> 0:2:11,516
In fact, they're always moving.


28
0:2:11,516 --> 0:2:12,699
Working.


29
0:2:12,699 --> 0:2:14,804
I programmed these updates myself,


30
0:2:14,804 --> 0:2:17,651
it's part of my command thesis
for stellar navigation.


31
0:2:17,651 --> 0:2:19,84
It's your homework?


32
0:2:19,84 --> 0:2:21,92
- You could say that.
- Data Received.


33
0:2:21,92 --> 0:3:3,401
- Take us out Mr DeSalle.
- Aye, sir.


34
0:3:3,401 --> 0:3:7,578
So Vincent, how's Janice?


35
0:3:7,578 --> 0:3:8,567
DeSalle!!?


36
0:3:8,567 --> 0:3:12,748
We're veering off course,
helm is not responding.


37
0:3:12,748 --> 0:3:14,974
- What departure vector did you use?
- Earth Standard.


38
0:3:14,974 --> 0:3:16,239
Where's Bernard's Star?


39
0:3:16,239 --> 0:3:18,841
Six light minutes in that direction.
Where did you think we were?


40
0:3:18,841 --> 0:3:23,932
All the coordinates are in
reverse. Open that panel!


41
0:3:23,932 --> 0:3:26,615
- Now what?
- I've to reverse the nav sensors manually.


42
0:3:26,615 --> 0:3:30,658
- You'll have to compensate.
- Compensating.


43
0:3:30,658 --> 0:3:47,594
Sulu!!


44
0:3:47,594 --> 0:3:49,802
It's now or never, DeSalle.


45
0:3:49,802 --> 0:3:56,397
Be mine tonight.


46
0:3:56,397 --> 0:3:58,202
All stop Mr DeSalle.


47
0:3:58,202 --> 0:4:8,774
All stop, aye.


48
0:4:8,774 --> 0:4:11,217
My first exam in stellar nav I flunked


49
0:4:11,217 --> 0:4:14,913
because I'd switched a plus and a
minus early in the base equation.


50
0:4:14,913 --> 0:4:18,6
The rest of the calculations
were based on that.


51
0:4:18,6 --> 0:4:29,359
I hadn't had much sleep.


52
0:4:29,359 --> 0:4:45,16
I'll expect both of your reports by 0600.


53
0:4:45,16 --> 0:4:48,875
Computer... begin retrieving
navigational archive.


54
0:4:48,875 --> 0:4:55,407
Working.


55
0:4:55,407 --> 0:4:59,98
Did you really fly my ship
out of the time gateway?


56
0:4:59,98 --> 0:5:2,859
Hikaru, it was amazing, you should have been
there. The thing was huge to begin with,


57
0:5:2,859 --> 0:5:5,81
but, there were these
canyon walls and wind sheer...


58
0:5:5,81 --> 0:5:7,96
- Wind sheer?
- Like you could not believe


59
0:5:7,96 --> 0:7:7,96
and in one second we were
blasting through the atmosphere...
