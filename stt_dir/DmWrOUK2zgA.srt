0:0:12,93 --> 0:0:16,0
Professor Paul Bloom:
Two follow-ups on


2
0:0:16,0 --> 0:0:19,14
yesterday's--I'm sorry,
on Monday's lecture.


3
0:0:19,14 --> 0:0:24,667
One is that somebody came up
after class and asked when the


4
0:0:24,667 --> 0:0:30,195
preference for your own language
emerges in development and


5
0:0:30,195 --> 0:0:33,422
fortunately,
studies pretty much exactly


6
0:0:33,422 --> 0:0:35,63
this sort of infant
understanding.


7
0:0:35,63 --> 0:0:38,919
She knew the answer.
There's been studies looking at


8
0:0:38,919 --> 0:0:42,848
newborn babies finding that
pretty much the moment they pop


9
0:0:42,848 --> 0:0:45,761
out they favor their own
language over other


10
0:0:45,761 --> 0:0:49,97
language--over other languages.
And this suggests that they are


11
0:0:49,97 --> 0:0:52,425
listening while in utero,
while in the womb,


12
0:0:52,425 --> 0:0:55,166
to the rhythms of their
language and developing a


13
0:0:55,166 --> 0:0:57,936
preference for it.
A second issue is,


14
0:0:57,936 --> 0:1:2,712
I talked very briefly about a
court case in which the person


15
0:1:2,712 --> 0:1:7,406
was--said at a moment where
someone else was pointing a gun


16
0:1:7,406 --> 0:1:10,64
at a police officer,
"Let him have it!"


17
0:1:10,64 --> 0:1:14,284
and a police officer was killed.
And that person was charged


18
0:1:14,284 --> 0:1:17,747
with murder but I admitted I
didn't actually know how things


19
0:1:17,747 --> 0:1:21,209
turned out and was kind enough
to do extensive research.


20
0:1:21,209 --> 0:1:24,517
Well, he went to Wikipedia and
[laughter]


21
0:1:24,517 --> 0:1:28,667
found out the answer.
The answer is he was tried and


22
0:1:28,667 --> 0:1:33,137
found guilty for murder.
He was then subsequently


23
0:1:33,137 --> 0:1:36,97
pardoned.
In fact, he was pardoned in


24
0:1:36,97 --> 0:1:42,98
1988, which is really nice
except he was executed in 1957.


25
0:1:42,98 --> 0:1:47,27
But they did it into a movie.
So, it's a movie.


26
0:1:47,27 --> 0:1:49,789
Okay.
So, I want to do today,


27
0:1:49,789 --> 0:1:52,194
for the first part of the
lecture, is continue the


28
0:1:52,194 --> 0:1:54,354
language lecture and then move
to perception,


29
0:1:54,354 --> 0:1:57,675
attention, and memory.
And what we had spoken about


30
0:1:57,675 --> 0:2:1,31
was--We first talked about
universals of language,


31
0:2:1,31 --> 0:2:5,575
then moved to some detail about
the different aspects of


32
0:2:5,575 --> 0:2:9,78
language including phonology,
morphology, and syntax.


33
0:2:9,78 --> 0:2:13,982
We discussed the ways in which
language does the amazing things


34
0:2:13,982 --> 0:2:17,981
it does, including the fact that
language has used arbitrary


35
0:2:17,981 --> 0:2:20,759
science or sounds to convey
concepts,


36
0:2:20,759 --> 0:2:25,104
and that languages exploit a
combinatorial system including


37
0:2:25,104 --> 0:2:29,224
recursion to put together these
symbols into a virtually


38
0:2:29,224 --> 0:2:32,37
limitless set of meaningful
sentences.


39
0:2:32,37 --> 0:2:35,219
We then talked about
development and made some


40
0:2:35,219 --> 0:2:39,18
remarks about the developmental
time course – talking about


41
0:2:39,18 --> 0:2:42,817
the emergence of language from
babies to – where babies are


42
0:2:42,817 --> 0:2:46,49
really good at learning language
to you who are not,


43
0:2:46,49 --> 0:2:52,973
whose brains have atrophied,
whose language capacities are


44
0:2:52,973 --> 0:2:55,723
dead.
Final issue is to shift to


45
0:2:55,723 --> 0:2:58,625
animals.
Now that we know something


46
0:2:58,625 --> 0:3:2,305
about language,
we could then ask do animals


47
0:3:2,305 --> 0:3:5,9
use--possess the same sort of
language?


48
0:3:5,9 --> 0:3:9,5
And if not, can they learn it?
Now, there is absolutely no


49
0:3:9,5 --> 0:3:12,758
doubt at all that nonhuman
animals possess communication


50
0:3:12,758 --> 0:3:16,53
systems.
This has been known forever and


51
0:3:16,53 --> 0:3:20,59
is not a matter of controversy.
And if you want to use the term


52
0:3:20,59 --> 0:3:22,268
"language" to mean
"communication," then the answer


53
0:3:22,268 --> 0:3:25,384
is obviously "yes."
Dogs and bees and monkeys have


54
0:3:25,384 --> 0:3:28,245
language.
If you want to use language


55
0:3:28,245 --> 0:3:32,855
though in the more technical,
narrow sense as anything that


56
0:3:32,855 --> 0:3:36,669
has the properties that we
discussed earlier,


57
0:3:36,669 --> 0:3:39,78
using English and ASL and
Spanish and so on as our


58
0:3:39,78 --> 0:3:42,889
background, the answer's almost
certainly "no."


59
0:3:42,889 --> 0:3:47,23
Animal communication systems
fall into sort of one of three


60
0:3:47,23 --> 0:3:49,853
categories.
Either there is a finite list


61
0:3:49,853 --> 0:3:52,543
of calls, so vervet monkeys,
for instance,


62
0:3:52,543 --> 0:3:56,416
have a small list of calls to
convey different warnings like


63
0:3:56,416 --> 0:3:59,96
"attack from a snake" or "attack
from a leopard."


64
0:3:59,96 --> 0:4:2,46
There is a continuous analog
signal.


65
0:4:2,46 --> 0:4:4,298
So, bee dance,
for instance,


66
0:4:4,298 --> 0:4:6,984
works on this way.
Bee dance communicates the


67
0:4:6,984 --> 0:4:9,429
location of food sources but
doesn't do it in any


68
0:4:9,429 --> 0:4:12,538
syntactically structured way.
Rather, the intensity of the


69
0:4:12,538 --> 0:4:15,389
dance corresponds to the
richness of the food source.


70
0:4:15,389 --> 0:4:19,212
And then, you get things like
random variation on a theme such


71
0:4:19,212 --> 0:4:22,502
as birdsong.
But what you don't find in any


72
0:4:22,502 --> 0:4:25,961
real sense is phonology,
morphology, syntax,


73
0:4:25,961 --> 0:4:29,5
combinatorial systems or
arbitrary names.


74
0:4:29,5 --> 0:4:32,66
Now, this much is not
particularly controversial.


75
0:4:32,66 --> 0:4:35,89
There gets to be a lot of
controversy though.


76
0:4:35,89 --> 0:4:37,56
This is the summary about
nonhuman communication systems.


77
0:4:37,56 --> 0:4:42,995
It gets more controversial when
we get to famous cases of


78
0:4:42,995 --> 0:4:47,17
primates trained by humans such
as Kanzi,


79
0:4:47,17 --> 0:4:50,57
Nim Chimpsky,
and other famous primates that


80
0:4:50,57 --> 0:4:55,0
you may well have seen on the
Discovery channel and other


81
0:4:55,0 --> 0:4:56,933
venues.
And this is fairly


82
0:4:56,933 --> 0:5:0,35
controversial.
If you read the Gray textbook,


83
0:5:0,35 --> 0:5:3,579
while nothing in it is
particularly inaccurate,


84
0:5:3,579 --> 0:5:6,628
I think Gray is actually a
little bit too credulous,


85
0:5:6,628 --> 0:5:9,976
too believing in the claims
that have been made about the


86
0:5:9,976 --> 0:5:13,658
abilities of the animals.
So many scientists argue,


87
0:5:13,658 --> 0:5:16,543
for instance,
that animals like Kanzi,


88
0:5:16,543 --> 0:5:20,597
even if they can be said to be
learning words at all,


89
0:5:20,597 --> 0:5:24,87
learn very few of them.
And it takes them extensive


90
0:5:24,87 --> 0:5:29,129
years of training to learn,
unlike a normally developing


91
0:5:29,129 --> 0:5:33,93
child who could learn a word in
a day or a word in an hour.


92
0:5:33,93 --> 0:5:38,594
The utterances often have order
but this order tends to be very


93
0:5:38,594 --> 0:5:41,98
limited and lacks the recursive
properties.


94
0:5:41,98 --> 0:5:44,794
And in fact,
the lack of recursion is not


95
0:5:44,794 --> 0:5:48,343
controversial.
Finally, the utterances of


96
0:5:48,343 --> 0:5:54,308
chimpanzees--trained chimpanzees
are extremely repetitive so what


97
0:5:54,308 --> 0:5:59,155
you often see on TV and in
documentaries is sort of a


98
0:5:59,155 --> 0:6:2,353
sampling.
And the sampling could often be


99
0:6:2,353 --> 0:6:6,14
very impressive but if you take
just what they say at random it


100
0:6:6,14 --> 0:6:9,526
tends to look like this.
This is typical chimpanzee


101
0:6:9,526 --> 0:6:13,0
utterances just taken at random:
"Nim eat, Nim eat.


102
0:6:13,0 --> 0:6:16,64
Drink, eat, me Nim.
Me gum, me gum.


103
0:6:16,64 --> 0:6:20,139
Tickle me, Nim play.
Me eat, me eat.


104
0:6:20,139 --> 0:6:22,68
Me banana, you banana,
me you give.


105
0:6:22,68 --> 0:6:26,3
Banana me, me eat.
Give orange,


106
0:6:26,3 --> 0:6:29,189
me give, eat orange,
me eat orange."


107
0:6:29,189 --> 0:6:33,995
Lila Gleitman once commented
that if any normally developing


108
0:6:33,995 --> 0:6:37,905
child spoke like this,
his parents would rush him


109
0:6:37,905 --> 0:6:42,283
screaming to a neurologist.
There's a broader question


110
0:6:42,283 --> 0:6:45,277
here, which is,
"Why would we ever expect a


111
0:6:45,277 --> 0:6:48,199
chimpanzee to learn a human
language?"


112
0:6:48,199 --> 0:6:52,638
We don't normally expect one
species to have the capacities


113
0:6:52,638 --> 0:6:57,363
associated with another species.
So, bats use echolocation to


114
0:6:57,363 --> 0:7:1,79
get around and some birds
navigate by the stars,


115
0:7:1,79 --> 0:7:4,337
but there's not an active
research program seeing if cats


116
0:7:4,337 --> 0:7:7,769
can use echolocation or dogs
could navigate by the stars.


117
0:7:7,769 --> 0:7:10,795
And I think one reason why you
might be tempted to think,


118
0:7:10,795 --> 0:7:13,875
"well, of course chimps must be
able to learn language" is


119
0:7:13,875 --> 0:7:16,955
because you might be caught in
the grips of some bad ideas


120
0:7:16,955 --> 0:7:20,311
about language.
So, one idea is you might say,


121
0:7:20,311 --> 0:7:22,139
"Look.
Chimps should use language


122
0:7:22,139 --> 0:7:26,521
because chimps are so smart."
But the response to this is,


123
0:7:26,521 --> 0:7:32,6
"they are smart but we know
that smart isn't enough."


124
0:7:32,6 --> 0:7:35,901
We know that the human capacity
for language is not totally a


125
0:7:35,901 --> 0:7:38,906
result of smartness.
There are smart children who,


126
0:7:38,906 --> 0:7:41,438
due to some deficit in their
language capacity,


127
0:7:41,438 --> 0:7:43,639
don't speak or understand a
language.


128
0:7:43,639 --> 0:7:46,439
So, the smartness of
chimpanzees does not in itself


129
0:7:46,439 --> 0:7:49,629
demonstrate that they should be
able to learn language.


130
0:7:49,629 --> 0:7:51,897
You might also point out
correctly that chimps are our


131
0:7:51,897 --> 0:7:54,549
nearest evolutionary relatives,
which is right,


132
0:7:54,549 --> 0:7:58,763
so you--one would expect on the
face of it--it's not


133
0:7:58,763 --> 0:8:3,473
unreasonable to expect us to
share a lot of abilities with


134
0:8:3,473 --> 0:8:5,649
them.
On the other hand,


135
0:8:5,649 --> 0:8:9,846
we split from them a long time
ago and plainly humans are


136
0:8:9,846 --> 0:8:13,532
different from chimps.
And there was five million


137
0:8:13,532 --> 0:8:17,925
years either way and that's more
than enough time for a language


138
0:8:17,925 --> 0:8:22,205
capacity to evolve.
Now, none of this is to say


139
0:8:22,205 --> 0:8:27,594
that the study of nonhuman
communication systems isn't


140
0:8:27,594 --> 0:8:30,794
interesting.
From my own--This is my


141
0:8:30,794 --> 0:8:33,269
personal opinion I'll raise
here.


142
0:8:33,269 --> 0:8:36,456
From my own opinion,
the study of the attempts to


143
0:8:36,456 --> 0:8:39,709
try to teach chimpanzees,
or gibbons, or gorillas,


144
0:8:39,709 --> 0:8:42,629
a human language like ASL are
misguided.


145
0:8:42,629 --> 0:8:46,274
It would be as if a team of
monkeys kidnapped a human child


146
0:8:46,274 --> 0:8:49,48
and tried to train him how to
hoot like a monkey.


147
0:8:49,48 --> 0:8:52,552
It might be enjoyable but it
does not seem to give us any


148
0:8:52,552 --> 0:8:54,854
rich insights.
What I think is a lot more


149
0:8:54,854 --> 0:8:57,759
interesting is the study of
these animal communication


150
0:8:57,759 --> 0:9:0,822
systems in the wild.
There's a linguistics of human


151
0:9:0,822 --> 0:9:4,428
language that has delineated the
principles that underlie all


152
0:9:4,428 --> 0:9:7,446
human languages.
It would be as extraordinarily


153
0:9:7,446 --> 0:9:11,325
interesting to attempt the same
linguistic program to the other


154
0:9:11,325 --> 0:9:14,953
communication systems used in
the wild such as the cries of


155
0:9:14,953 --> 0:9:18,657
vervet monkeys and bee dance.
So, this brings the section on


156
0:9:18,657 --> 0:9:21,655
language to a close but I want
to tell you a few things we


157
0:9:21,655 --> 0:9:24,99
didn't talk about.
One of the problems with an


158
0:9:24,99 --> 0:9:27,75
Intro Psych course is we have to
whip through a lot of topics


159
0:9:27,75 --> 0:9:29,165
very fast.
So, if you were to take a


160
0:9:29,165 --> 0:9:32,519
course that focused directly on
language you might learn,


161
0:9:32,519 --> 0:9:34,347
for instance,
more about language in the


162
0:9:34,347 --> 0:9:37,252
brain, something touched about
very briefly in the textbook but


163
0:9:37,252 --> 0:9:40,11
something that has a large
literature associated with it.


164
0:9:40,11 --> 0:9:44,446
Similarly, and related to this,
there's language disorders,


165
0:9:44,446 --> 0:9:48,856
disorders like aphasias and
disorders like specific language


166
0:9:48,856 --> 0:9:52,292
impairment and dyslexia.
There is the study of language


167
0:9:52,292 --> 0:9:54,943
perception and production.
How is it that we do this


168
0:9:54,943 --> 0:9:58,4
amazing feat of understanding
and producing words in a


169
0:9:58,4 --> 0:10:1,547
fraction of a second?
Where does that ability come


170
0:10:1,547 --> 0:10:3,815
from?
There is the study of reading


171
0:10:3,815 --> 0:10:7,52
which is, in many ways,
different from the study of a


172
0:10:7,52 --> 0:10:10,167
language.
Remember when Darwin described


173
0:10:10,167 --> 0:10:13,753
language as an instinct.
He carefully distinguished it


174
0:10:13,753 --> 0:10:16,868
from other things that don't
come natural to us including


175
0:10:16,868 --> 0:10:18,27
reading.
And in fact,


176
0:10:18,27 --> 0:10:20,788
reading is difficult.
Reading is a cultural


177
0:10:20,788 --> 0:10:22,57
invention, not every human has
it.


178
0:10:22,57 --> 0:10:25,346
And unlike language,
reading is acquired with


179
0:10:25,346 --> 0:10:27,87
tremendous difficulty over many
years.


180
0:10:27,87 --> 0:10:30,728
On the other hand,
reading plainly intersects with


181
0:10:30,728 --> 0:10:32,975
language.
It's a new way of conveying


182
0:10:32,975 --> 0:10:35,649
language, moving out from speech
to writing.


183
0:10:35,649 --> 0:10:39,22
And the psychology and
neuroscience of reading is thus


184
0:10:39,22 --> 0:10:42,244
very interesting.
There's bilingualism and


185
0:10:42,244 --> 0:10:45,602
multilingualism.
The questions people in this


186
0:10:45,602 --> 0:10:50,225
room typically are going to be
interested in is does it matter


187
0:10:50,225 --> 0:10:54,849
for how well you learn language
whether you're learning one or


188
0:10:54,849 --> 0:10:58,837
two or three or four.
How is it that a multilingual


189
0:10:58,837 --> 0:11:3,8
encodes all these different
languages inside a single brain?


190
0:11:3,8 --> 0:11:7,878
And so on.
Finally, a very hot issue is


191
0:11:7,878 --> 0:11:12,224
that of the relationship between
language and thought and I'm


192
0:11:12,224 --> 0:11:16,426
actually--A few years ago I
taught an entire seminar called


193
0:11:16,426 --> 0:11:20,99
"Language and Thought" devoted
to precisely this question.


194
0:11:20,99 --> 0:11:24,425
And it's a cool question and it
could break up into two very


195
0:11:24,425 --> 0:11:27,333
general questions.
One is, "Is language necessary


196
0:11:27,333 --> 0:11:30,361
for abstract thought?"
And one way to answer that


197
0:11:30,361 --> 0:11:34,526
question is to look at creatures
without language like babies and


198
0:11:34,526 --> 0:11:37,259
chimpanzees and see how smart
they are.


199
0:11:37,259 --> 0:11:39,541
It might be that they're
not--that they're very smart,


200
0:11:39,541 --> 0:11:41,995
in which case it would suggest
you don't need language for


201
0:11:41,995 --> 0:11:43,787
abstract thought.
On the other hand,


202
0:11:43,787 --> 0:11:46,548
it might be that they have
certain cognitive limitations,


203
0:11:46,548 --> 0:11:48,965
which would suggest that
language is essential for


204
0:11:48,965 --> 0:11:51,624
abstract thought.
Then there's the related


205
0:11:51,624 --> 0:11:53,954
question.
Even once you know a language,


206
0:11:53,954 --> 0:11:57,247
does the structural properties
of the language that you know


207
0:11:57,247 --> 0:12:0,702
affect the way you think?
And the claim that the language


208
0:12:0,702 --> 0:12:4,61
you know affects how you think
is sometimes described as


209
0:12:4,61 --> 0:12:7,419
linguistic relativity or the
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.


210
0:12:7,419 --> 0:12:9,741
So for instance,
there's a lot of research


211
0:12:9,741 --> 0:12:13,364
looking at speakers of different
languages such as English versus


212
0:12:13,364 --> 0:12:16,535
Korean and seeing whether
structural differences in these


213
0:12:16,535 --> 0:12:19,966
languages affect how you think.
Now, some of this work is


214
0:12:19,966 --> 0:12:22,96
discussed in the readings,
the book--the Gray textbook,


215
0:12:22,96 --> 0:12:26,813
and the selections from The
Norton Anthology. And this


216
0:12:26,813 --> 0:12:29,687
makes up--again,
I've showed this to you on


217
0:12:29,687 --> 0:12:33,584
Monday--your reading response
where you have to address this


218
0:12:33,584 --> 0:12:37,2
question and take your best shot
at answering it.


219
0:12:37,2 --> 0:12:40,8



220
0:12:40,8 --> 0:12:42,11
What are your questions about
language?


221
0:12:42,11 --> 0:12:54,1



222
0:12:54,1 --> 0:13:0,48
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]


223
0:13:0,48 --> 0:13:6,36
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question was raised,


224
0:13:6,36 --> 0:13:9,873
"Some people learn languages
easier than others and how do we


225
0:13:9,873 --> 0:13:13,42
explain this?"
And the answer is you could ask


226
0:13:13,42 --> 0:13:17,508
the question both with regard to
first language learning – so


227
0:13:17,508 --> 0:13:20,75
some children learn language
very quickly,


228
0:13:20,75 --> 0:13:23,774
some are very slow – and also
with regard to second language


229
0:13:23,774 --> 0:13:25,659
learning.
Some of you are breezing


230
0:13:25,659 --> 0:13:28,73
through your second language
requirement here at Yale.


231
0:13:28,73 --> 0:13:31,809
Others are struggling and
miserable.


232
0:13:31,809 --> 0:13:34,36
And there's considerable
variation.


233
0:13:34,36 --> 0:13:37,95
There's the story of Einstein
who was very slow to learn


234
0:13:37,95 --> 0:13:41,409
language and didn't speak at all
until he was four.


235
0:13:41,409 --> 0:13:43,709
And in fact,
he was a--He said his first


236
0:13:43,709 --> 0:13:46,952
words when all of a sudden he
was having supper with his


237
0:13:46,952 --> 0:13:49,9
parents and he put down the
spoon and he said,


238
0:13:49,9 --> 0:13:54,182
"The soup is too hot."
And his parents stared in


239
0:13:54,182 --> 0:13:56,86
astonishment and said,
"You've never spoken before."


240
0:13:56,86 --> 0:14:1,658
And he said,
"Well, up to now everything's


241
0:14:1,658 --> 0:14:4,204
been fine."
[laughter]


242
0:14:4,204 --> 0:14:7,285
It's not a true story.
[laughter]


243
0:14:7,285 --> 0:14:11,421
The question of why and where
these differences come from,


244
0:14:11,421 --> 0:14:15,49
nobody really knows and it's
surprisingly hard.


245
0:14:15,49 --> 0:14:18,34
There's a slight advantage for
being female.


246
0:14:18,34 --> 0:14:21,403
Girls are slightly more
advanced in language than boys


247
0:14:21,403 --> 0:14:24,814
but it's not a big one and you
need a hundred people to just


248
0:14:24,814 --> 0:14:29,25
see it statistically.
There's a big genetic factor.


249
0:14:29,25 --> 0:14:32,32
If your parents learned
language quickly and learned


250
0:14:32,32 --> 0:14:34,759
other languages quickly,
you are more likely to.


251
0:14:34,759 --> 0:14:39,99
But an understanding of the
brain bases of these differences


252
0:14:39,99 --> 0:14:43,585
or the cognitive bases or the
social bases is just--is largely


253
0:14:43,585 --> 0:14:46,45
an open question.
Yes.


254
0:14:46,45 --> 0:14:50,123
Student: What happens
when parents [inaudible]


255
0:14:50,123 --> 0:14:54,221
Professor Paul Bloom:
This is actually more the norm


256
0:14:54,221 --> 0:14:58,107
around the world than the
situation in the United States


257
0:14:58,107 --> 0:15:1,639
where kids are exposed to a
single language.


258
0:15:1,639 --> 0:15:5,429
What happens is children learn
both languages.


259
0:15:5,429 --> 0:15:7,415
Children are very good,
as adults are,


260
0:15:7,415 --> 0:15:10,527
of distinguishing different
languages on the basis of their


261
0:15:10,527 --> 0:15:13,799
sound system and their rhythms
so they don't typically confuse


262
0:15:13,799 --> 0:15:15,713
them.
And then they just learn more


263
0:15:15,713 --> 0:15:19,1
than one language.
And that's actually more the


264
0:15:19,1 --> 0:15:22,72
average state of affairs around
the world.


265
0:15:22,72 --> 0:15:27,162
Yes.
Student: You said that


266
0:15:27,162 --> 0:15:32,38
people who are right-handed
learn languages [inaudible]


267
0:15:32,38 --> 0:15:37,501
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question is about the


268
0:15:37,501 --> 0:15:41,85
hemispheric specialization for
language.


269
0:15:41,85 --> 0:15:44,954
And I don't have actually much
more to say than what I said


270
0:15:44,954 --> 0:15:47,47
before, which I agree is deeply
unsatisfying.


271
0:15:47,47 --> 0:15:50,62
If you're right-handed,
language is probably in the


272
0:15:50,62 --> 0:15:53,803
left side of your brain.
How many people here are


273
0:15:53,803 --> 0:15:56,89
left-handed?
For you we don't know.


274
0:15:56,89 --> 0:16:0,12
It varies.
Some of you have it in the left


275
0:16:0,12 --> 0:16:1,314
side.
Some of you have it in the


276
0:16:1,314 --> 0:16:3,596
right side.
For some of you it's kind of


277
0:16:3,596 --> 0:16:6,409
diffuse.
Now, why is this?


278
0:16:6,409 --> 0:16:8,305
And in fact,
why are some people


279
0:16:8,305 --> 0:16:11,79
right-handed and others
left-handed in the first place?


280
0:16:11,79 --> 0:16:16,73
Those are really good questions.
Yes.


281
0:16:16,73 --> 0:16:28,46
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:


282
0:16:28,46 --> 0:16:32,253
Yes.
I'll--Yes, that's--I'll answer


283
0:16:32,253 --> 0:16:34,232
that question.
And unfortunately,


284
0:16:34,232 --> 0:16:36,559
it's going to be the last one
and then I'll go to vision.


285
0:16:36,559 --> 0:16:38,885
The question is,
"Does learning more than one


286
0:16:38,885 --> 0:16:42,11
language cause you to learn them
slower than just learning one


287
0:16:42,11 --> 0:16:44,145
language?"
And it would stand to reason


288
0:16:44,145 --> 0:16:46,57
that it would.
There's a finite amount of


289
0:16:46,57 --> 0:16:48,394
mental resources.
If I'm just learning English,


290
0:16:48,394 --> 0:16:51,73
I use all of it for English.
And if I'm learning English and


291
0:16:51,73 --> 0:16:54,963
Spanish I kind of got to split.
And you'd expect them to be


292
0:16:54,963 --> 0:16:57,782
each learned slower.
It's one of the surprises of


293
0:16:57,782 --> 0:17:0,455
the study of language
development that that


294
0:17:0,455 --> 0:17:3,509
common-sense view does not
appear to be true.


295
0:17:3,509 --> 0:17:8,327
Children learning more than one
language seem to show no deficit


296
0:17:8,327 --> 0:17:12,609
relative--in each of their
languages, relative to a child


297
0:17:12,609 --> 0:17:15,742
learning just one language.
In other words,


298
0:17:15,742 --> 0:17:18,438
if I am just learning English
and I'm a kid and you're


299
0:17:18,438 --> 0:17:20,93
learning English and Spanish and
you're a kid,


300
0:17:20,93 --> 0:17:25,539
you'll reach the milestones in
English the same time I will.


301
0:17:25,539 --> 0:17:28,63
Your extra learning of Spanish
doesn't seem to affect you.


302
0:17:28,63 --> 0:17:32,469
There doesn't seem to be any
detriment for learning multiple


303
0:17:32,469 --> 0:17:35,451
languages.
Another question which comes up


304
0:17:35,451 --> 0:17:38,15
is, "Is there any cognitive
deficit?"


305
0:17:38,15 --> 0:17:40,149
In other words,
some people have argued that


306
0:17:40,149 --> 0:17:42,659
learning multiple languages
sometimes harms children in


307
0:17:42,659 --> 0:17:44,884
certain ways.
This is a claim that's been


308
0:17:44,884 --> 0:17:46,371
made in Quebec,
for instance,


309
0:17:46,371 --> 0:17:48,974
over the debate over how
children should be taught


310
0:17:48,974 --> 0:17:51,814
English and French.
It does not appear to be the


311
0:17:51,814 --> 0:17:53,717
case.
There appears to be,


312
0:17:53,717 --> 0:17:57,4
as far as we know,
no down side to learning many


313
0:17:57,4 --> 0:18:2,63
languages when you're young.
Does that answer your question?


314
0:18:2,63 --> 0:18:7,0



315
0:18:7,0 --> 0:18:11,546
I want to move now to the topic
that will take us through today


316
0:18:11,546 --> 0:18:15,433
and through the beginning of
next week – perception,


317
0:18:15,433 --> 0:18:19,321
attention, and memory.
And I'm putting them together


318
0:18:19,321 --> 0:18:22,875
instead of treating them as
separate lectures because


319
0:18:22,875 --> 0:18:26,36
there's a sense in which they're
the same story.


320
0:18:26,36 --> 0:18:30,398
You see a scene.
You see this scene and you're


321
0:18:30,398 --> 0:18:32,92
looking at it and you're
perceiving it.


322
0:18:32,92 --> 0:18:35,743
It's coming through your eyes
and you're interpreting it and


323
0:18:35,743 --> 0:18:37,97
you see something.
You see a man and you see a


324
0:18:37,97 --> 0:18:40,19
house.
If you were to shut your eyes,


325
0:18:40,19 --> 0:18:42,9
you could still hold that scene
in memory.


326
0:18:42,9 --> 0:18:49,16
And a week later,
if I'm to ask you about that,


327
0:18:49,16 --> 0:18:54,69
"What season was it?"
you would do pretty well.


328
0:18:54,69 --> 0:18:58,49
This is the story I want to
talk about – how we do this.


329
0:18:58,49 --> 0:19:3,281
And in the course of this I
want to make a series of claims


330
0:19:3,281 --> 0:19:6,624
that go something like this.
For perception,


331
0:19:6,624 --> 0:19:10,8
I want to first persuade you
the problem of perception's hard


332
0:19:10,8 --> 0:19:13,18
and that successful perception
involves educated and


333
0:19:13,18 --> 0:19:15,38
unconscious guesses about the
world.


334
0:19:15,38 --> 0:19:17,708
For attention,
I want to suggest that we


335
0:19:17,708 --> 0:19:21,291
attend to some things and not
others and we miss a surprising


336
0:19:21,291 --> 0:19:23,68
amount of what happens in the
world.


337
0:19:23,68 --> 0:19:27,39
For memory, there are many
types of memory.


338
0:19:27,39 --> 0:19:29,589
The key to memory is
organization and understanding.


339
0:19:29,589 --> 0:19:33,799
And you can't trust some of
your memories.


340
0:19:33,799 --> 0:19:39,4
How many of you remember where
you were at 9/11?


341
0:19:39,4 --> 0:19:43,541
Many of you are wrong.
And I am never going to


342
0:19:43,541 --> 0:19:48,44
persuade you of this because you
have certain memories.


343
0:19:48,44 --> 0:19:51,515
And you could tell the story.
Everybody could tell the story


344
0:19:51,515 --> 0:19:54,16
where they were when the towers
went down.


345
0:19:54,16 --> 0:19:57,787
But clever psychologists on
September 12 said,


346
0:19:57,787 --> 0:20:0,657
"Let's do a study."
And they asked people,


347
0:20:0,657 --> 0:20:3,44
"Where were you yesterday when
you heard the news?"


348
0:20:3,44 --> 0:20:6,325
And they told them.
And then they went back to them


349
0:20:6,325 --> 0:20:8,573
later, a year later,
two years later,


350
0:20:8,573 --> 0:20:12,69
and said, "Tell me about what
happened September 11."


351
0:20:12,69 --> 0:20:14,215
And they said,
"I remember totally where I


352
0:20:14,215 --> 0:20:16,266
was.
I have a very--" And then--And


353
0:20:16,266 --> 0:20:20,208
often the story was wrong.
There is a lot like that which


354
0:20:20,208 --> 0:20:24,879
we're going to talk about.
And the biggest moral then--so,


355
0:20:24,879 --> 0:20:28,389
I put it really,
in really big print--We are


356
0:20:28,389 --> 0:20:32,714
often wrong about our
experiences, both of the present


357
0:20:32,714 --> 0:20:37,859
and of right now.
So, let's start with perception.


358
0:20:37,859 --> 0:20:41,994
There is a story--I went to
graduate school at MIT and there


359
0:20:41,994 --> 0:20:45,639
was a story there about Marvin
Minsky who is the A.I.


360
0:20:45,639 --> 0:20:47,666
guru.
He--If you've heard the


361
0:20:47,666 --> 0:20:51,25
words--the phrase "artificial
intelligence," that was him.


362
0:20:51,25 --> 0:20:55,94
And if you heard the claim that
people are nothing more than


363
0:20:55,94 --> 0:20:59,102
machines made of meat--also him.
Well, there's a story where he


364
0:20:59,102 --> 0:21:2,747
was doing work on robotics and
he was interested in building a


365
0:21:2,747 --> 0:21:6,809
robot that could do all sorts of
cool things that's like a robot.


366
0:21:6,809 --> 0:21:12,44
And the story goes the robot
had to among--had to write--had


367
0:21:12,44 --> 0:21:15,543
to see the world.
It had to be able to pick up


368
0:21:15,543 --> 0:21:19,559
things and recognize people and
see chairs and navigate its way


369
0:21:19,559 --> 0:21:22,41
and Minsky said,
"That's a tough problem.


370
0:21:22,41 --> 0:21:25,468
It's going to take a graduate
student a whole summer to figure


371
0:21:25,468 --> 0:21:27,361
it out."
And he assigned it to a


372
0:21:27,361 --> 0:21:29,72
graduate student for a summer
project.


373
0:21:29,72 --> 0:21:33,476
Visual psychologists,
perception psychologists,


374
0:21:33,476 --> 0:21:37,967
love that story because the
study of computer vision and


375
0:21:37,967 --> 0:21:42,622
robotics vision and the attempts
to make machines that can


376
0:21:42,622 --> 0:21:47,93
identify and recognize objects
has been a profound failure.


377
0:21:47,93 --> 0:21:52,183
There is, at this point,
no machine on earth that could


378
0:21:52,183 --> 0:21:57,146
recognize people and objects and
things at the level of a really


379
0:21:57,146 --> 0:22:1,548
dumb one-year-old.
And the reason why is that it's


380
0:22:1,548 --> 0:22:6,369
a much harder problem than
anybody could have expected.


381
0:22:6,369 --> 0:22:10,49
Well, what makes it such a hard
problem?


382
0:22:10,49 --> 0:22:13,486
Well, one reason why you might
think it's an easy problem is


383
0:22:13,486 --> 0:22:15,633
you say, "Okay.
We have to figure out the


384
0:22:15,633 --> 0:22:19,329
problem of how people see.
Well, here's what we do."


385
0:22:19,329 --> 0:22:23,49
You're in--You're over there
and here's your eye.


386
0:22:23,49 --> 0:22:25,902
And somehow it has to get to
this television monitor and then


387
0:22:25,902 --> 0:22:28,85
you look at it and that'll solve
the problem of how you see.


388
0:22:28,85 --> 0:22:31,892
So, sometimes people say, "Hey.
I hear the eye flips things


389
0:22:31,892 --> 0:22:33,944
upside down.
I guess this guy is going to


390
0:22:33,944 --> 0:22:36,32
have to get used to looking at
things upside down.


391
0:22:36,32 --> 0:22:39,69
That's an interesting problem."
No.


392
0:22:39,69 --> 0:22:43,373
That's not the way to look at
it because that doesn't answer


393
0:22:43,373 --> 0:22:46,48
any questions.
That just pushes the question


394
0:22:46,48 --> 0:22:46,75
back.
Fine.


395
0:22:46,75 --> 0:22:50,18
How does "he" see?
We're not answering anything.


396
0:22:50,18 --> 0:22:53,265
Similarly, although the
Terminator's view of the world


397
0:22:53,265 --> 0:22:56,409
may correspond to that ,
that doesn't solve any problem


398
0:22:56,409 --> 0:22:59,492
of how he actually sees.
So, he has all these numbers


399
0:22:59,492 --> 0:23:1,388
shooting out there.
Well, he has to read the


400
0:23:1,388 --> 0:23:2,85
numbers.
He has to see this.


401
0:23:2,85 --> 0:23:10,99
This is my iTunes.
[laughter] That's inadvertent.


402
0:23:10,99 --> 0:23:15,579
Here's the right way to think
about perception.


403
0:23:15,579 --> 0:23:19,187
You got the eye,
which is very ugly and bloody,


404
0:23:19,187 --> 0:23:22,559
and then around here you have
the retina.


405
0:23:22,559 --> 0:23:24,829
And the retina is a bunch of
nerve cells.


406
0:23:24,829 --> 0:23:29,42
And the nerve cells fire
at--for some stimulus and not


407
0:23:29,42 --> 0:23:32,795
others.
And from this array of firings,


408
0:23:32,795 --> 0:23:37,399
"firing… not firing…
firing… not firing," you have


409
0:23:37,399 --> 0:23:44,369
to figure out what the world is.
So, a better view is like this.


410
0:23:44,369 --> 0:23:48,383
The firings of the neurons
could be viewed as an array of


411
0:23:48,383 --> 0:23:51,701
numbers.
You have to figure out how to


412
0:23:51,701 --> 0:23:57,173
get from the numbers to objects
and people, and to actions and


413
0:23:57,173 --> 0:23:59,549
events.
And that's the problem.


414
0:23:59,549 --> 0:24:3,41
It's made particularly a
difficult problem because the


415
0:24:3,41 --> 0:24:6,861
retina is a two-dimensional
surface and you have to infer a


416
0:24:6,861 --> 0:24:9,759
3D world from a two-dimensional
surface.


417
0:24:9,759 --> 0:24:12,749
And this is,
from a mathematical point of


418
0:24:12,749 --> 0:24:15,871
view, impossible.
And what this means is that


419
0:24:15,871 --> 0:24:19,527
there--For any two-dimensional
image there is an indefinite


420
0:24:19,527 --> 0:24:23,309
number of three-dimensional
images that correspond to it.


421
0:24:23,309 --> 0:24:27,29
So for instance,
suppose you have this on your


422
0:24:27,29 --> 0:24:31,359
retina, an array of light shaped
like that .


423
0:24:31,359 --> 0:24:33,299
What does that correspond to in
the world?


424
0:24:33,299 --> 0:24:37,33
Well, it could correspond to a
thing just like that that you're


425
0:24:37,33 --> 0:24:40,165
looking for or it could
correspond to a square that's


426
0:24:40,165 --> 0:24:43,81
tilted backwards.
And so, you have to figure out


427
0:24:43,81 --> 0:24:47,494
which is which.
And the way we solve this


428
0:24:47,494 --> 0:24:52,518
problem is that we have
unconscious assumptions about


429
0:24:52,518 --> 0:24:56,692
how the world works.
Our minds contain certain


430
0:24:56,692 --> 0:25:1,38
assumptions about how things
should be that enable us to make


431
0:25:1,38 --> 0:25:5,754
educated guesses from the
two-dimensional array on to the


432
0:25:5,754 --> 0:25:9,616
three-dimensional world.
And I purposefully did not make


433
0:25:9,616 --> 0:25:12,604
the slides available for this
class ahead of time because I


434
0:25:12,604 --> 0:25:15,42
don't want people to cheat,
but there are several points


435
0:25:15,42 --> 0:25:18,5
where you could look at the
slides and confirm that some of


436
0:25:18,5 --> 0:25:20,5
the things I'm going to tell you
are actually true.


437
0:25:20,5 --> 0:25:22,88
And I want to give you three
examples.


438
0:25:22,88 --> 0:25:25,87
One is color.
And I'm going to conflate here


439
0:25:25,87 --> 0:25:28,4
color and brightness.
The other is objects.


440
0:25:28,4 --> 0:25:32,779
The other is depth.
First, the problem of color.


441
0:25:32,779 --> 0:25:36,21
How do you tell a lump of coal
from a snowball?


442
0:25:36,21 --> 0:25:40,892
Well, that's a lump of coal and
that's a snowball,


443
0:25:40,892 --> 0:25:46,269
and it's from Google images.
How do you know which is which?


444
0:25:46,269 --> 0:25:50,24
Well, a lump of coal you say is
black and a snowball is white.


445
0:25:50,24 --> 0:25:53,514
How do you know?
Well, maybe you have on your


446
0:25:53,514 --> 0:25:58,13
retina--Your retina responds to
sort of color that hits it.


447
0:25:58,13 --> 0:26:0,387
It's oversimplified,
but let's assume that this is


448
0:26:0,387 --> 0:26:2,97
true.
So, this is black coming out


449
0:26:2,97 --> 0:26:6,359
and that's white and that's how
you tell.


450
0:26:6,359 --> 0:26:9,319
But in fact,
that can't be right.


451
0:26:9,319 --> 0:26:13,43
It can't be right because
objects' color is not merely a


452
0:26:13,43 --> 0:26:17,84
matter of what material they're
made of but of the amount of


453
0:26:17,84 --> 0:26:21,794
light that hits it.
So, as I walk across the stage


454
0:26:21,794 --> 0:26:26,4
I fall into shadow and light,
and none of you screams out,


455
0:26:26,4 --> 0:26:29,19
"Professor Bloom is changing
colors!"


456
0:26:29,19 --> 0:26:34,265
Rather, you automatically
factor out the change in


457
0:26:34,265 --> 0:26:38,119
illumination as this is
happening.


458
0:26:38,119 --> 0:26:40,309
And this could actually be
quite striking.


459
0:26:40,309 --> 0:26:43,83
So, you see this display over
here.


460
0:26:43,83 --> 0:26:49,13
Take a look at those two blocks.
I take it you see this one as


461
0:26:49,13 --> 0:26:52,569
lighter than that one.
You do.


462
0:26:52,569 --> 0:26:57,744
You might imagine this is
because this strip is lighter


463
0:26:57,744 --> 0:27:1,7
than this but it isn't.
They're the same.


464
0:27:1,7 --> 0:27:6,22
And you won't believe me until
you actually print it out and


465
0:27:6,22 --> 0:27:9,32
take a look, but they are in
fact the same.


466
0:27:9,32 --> 0:27:11,664
I'll show it to you.
And you could say I'm tricking


467
0:27:11,664 --> 0:27:13,12
you but this is the way it
works.


468
0:27:13,12 --> 0:27:15,969
There's the close-up.
So, remember we're comparing


469
0:27:15,969 --> 0:27:19,972
this and this.
Now, let's take away other


470
0:27:19,972 --> 0:27:26,87
parts of the environment and
you'll see they're the same.


471
0:27:26,87 --> 0:27:32,36
Now you say, "But hold it.
This can't be the same as this"


472
0:27:32,36 --> 0:27:35,25
but the answer is--goes like
this.


473
0:27:35,25 --> 0:27:39,18
We know shadows make surfaces
darker.


474
0:27:39,18 --> 0:27:42,9
We don't know this like "Here's
something I know."


475
0:27:42,9 --> 0:27:47,109
Rather, we know this in that
it's wired up in our brains.


476
0:27:47,109 --> 0:27:52,663
So when we see a surface in
shadow we automatically assume


477
0:27:52,663 --> 0:27:58,509
that it's lighter than it looks,
and we see it as lighter.


478
0:27:58,509 --> 0:28:1,53
And you could show this by
removing the cues to the shadow.


479
0:28:1,53 --> 0:28:5,79
And you see it as it really is.
And this is an illustration of


480
0:28:5,79 --> 0:28:9,13
how the information to your eyes
is just one bit of information;


481
0:28:9,13 --> 0:28:13,491
the degree of light coming from
a single source is one bit of


482
0:28:13,491 --> 0:28:17,561
information that you use to
calculate certain assumptions


483
0:28:17,561 --> 0:28:21,537
and come to a conclusion.
Here's a different kind of


484
0:28:21,537 --> 0:28:24,411
example: Objects.
You see this and you


485
0:28:24,411 --> 0:28:28,68
automatically and intuitively
segment it into different


486
0:28:28,68 --> 0:28:31,832
objects.
You segment it into a man and a


487
0:28:31,832 --> 0:28:36,599
house and birds and trees.
How do you do this?


488
0:28:36,599 --> 0:28:38,963
It turns out,
to program a computer to


489
0:28:38,963 --> 0:28:42,86
segment a scene into different
objects is hugely difficult and


490
0:28:42,86 --> 0:28:47,21
the question of how we do it is,
to some extent, unknown.


491
0:28:47,21 --> 0:28:51,137
But one answer to this question
is there are certain cues in the


492
0:28:51,137 --> 0:28:54,378
environment that are signals
that you're dealing with


493
0:28:54,378 --> 0:28:57,362
different objects.
And these cues are often


494
0:28:57,362 --> 0:29:2,14
described as Gestalt principles.
So, one example is "proximity."


495
0:29:2,14 --> 0:29:5,172
When you see things that are
close to each other,


496
0:29:5,172 --> 0:29:8,962
you're more likely than not to
assume that they belong to the


497
0:29:8,962 --> 0:29:11,46
same thing.
There's "similarity."


498
0:29:11,46 --> 0:29:15,37
That display could correspond
to an indefinite number of


499
0:29:15,37 --> 0:29:18,289
objects but you naturally tend
to see it as two.


500
0:29:18,289 --> 0:29:22,139
You do one with one texture
pattern, the other with the


501
0:29:22,139 --> 0:29:25,21
other texture pattern.
"Closure."


502
0:29:25,21 --> 0:29:29,192
The fact that this is a closed
square here suggests it's a


503
0:29:29,192 --> 0:29:32,16
single object .
"Good continuation."


504
0:29:32,16 --> 0:29:35,725
If you had to judge,
this could just as well be two


505
0:29:35,725 --> 0:29:40,145
shapes, one that runs from A to
C, the other one that runs from


506
0:29:40,145 --> 0:29:42,131
D to B.
But you don't tend to see it


507
0:29:42,131 --> 0:29:44,58
that way.
Rather, you tend to see it as


508
0:29:44,58 --> 0:29:48,482
one that runs from A to B,
the other one that runs from C


509
0:29:48,482 --> 0:29:50,579
to D.
"Common movement."


510
0:29:50,579 --> 0:29:53,14
If things move together they're
a single object.


511
0:29:53,14 --> 0:29:57,38
And "good form."
You see the object over there .


512
0:29:57,38 --> 0:30:0,906
In the absence of any other
information, you might be


513
0:30:0,906 --> 0:30:4,839
tempted to say that's a single
thing, a plus sign maybe.


514
0:30:4,839 --> 0:30:8,764
This , because it has lousy
form, you're more tempted to say


515
0:30:8,764 --> 0:30:11,824
it's two things,
one thing lying on top of each


516
0:30:11,824 --> 0:30:14,742
other.
And these are the sort of cues,


517
0:30:14,742 --> 0:30:17,269
expectations;
none of them are right.


518
0:30:17,269 --> 0:30:21,99
There's cases where they could
all fool you.


519
0:30:21,99 --> 0:30:25,93
But these are useful cues that
guide our parceling of the


520
0:30:25,93 --> 0:30:29,3
world, our segmenting of the
world into distinct objects.


521
0:30:29,3 --> 0:30:32,176
Here they are summarized .
And here's a case where they


522
0:30:32,176 --> 0:30:34,931
fool you .
So you might think,


523
0:30:34,931 --> 0:30:40,99
if you're suggestible,
that there is a triangle here.


524
0:30:40,99 --> 0:30:44,226
And this is a case where there
are certain cues driving you to


525
0:30:44,226 --> 0:30:46,19
think that there's a triangle
here.


526
0:30:46,19 --> 0:30:48,38
There is, however,
no triangle here.


527
0:30:48,38 --> 0:30:53,466
If you cover up these little
Pacmen here, the triangle goes


528
0:30:53,466 --> 0:30:55,381
away.
Similarly, there is no square


529
0:30:55,381 --> 0:30:58,76
in the middle .
There is no square.


530
0:30:58,76 --> 0:31:3,669
It's very Matrix.
And these are illusions because


531
0:31:3,669 --> 0:31:8,393
these are cues that there should
be a square there,


532
0:31:8,393 --> 0:31:12,799
the regularity of form.
Finally, "depth."


533
0:31:12,799 --> 0:31:17,423
You see this and you don't--You
see it on one level as a flat


534
0:31:17,423 --> 0:31:19,492
thing.
Another level you look inside


535
0:31:19,492 --> 0:31:21,346
the picture and you see,
for instance,


536
0:31:21,346 --> 0:31:23,15
the man is in front of the
house.


537
0:31:23,15 --> 0:31:26,99
You look at me and you see the
podium.


538
0:31:26,99 --> 0:31:29,918
And if you have a terrible
neurological disorder you see


539
0:31:29,918 --> 0:31:32,847
this strange creature that's
half podium leading on to a


540
0:31:32,847 --> 0:31:35,776
chest and up to a head that's
sort of--the top of him is


541
0:31:35,776 --> 0:31:38,119
wiggling and the podium staying
still.


542
0:31:38,119 --> 0:31:41,8
If you are neurologically
normal, you see a man walking


543
0:31:41,8 --> 0:31:44,289
back and forth behind a podium.
How do you do that?


544
0:31:44,289 --> 0:31:49,642
Well, this is really a problem
because, I could give you a


545
0:31:49,642 --> 0:31:53,21
technical reason why vision is
hard,


546
0:31:53,21 --> 0:31:55,216
but crudely,
you got a two-dimensional


547
0:31:55,216 --> 0:31:58,58
retina and you have to figure
out a three-dimensional world.


548
0:31:58,58 --> 0:32:2,397
How do you do it?
And the answer once again is


549
0:32:2,397 --> 0:32:6,305
assumptions or cues.
There are certain assumptions


550
0:32:6,305 --> 0:32:10,72
the visual system makes that
aren't always right and in fact,


551
0:32:10,72 --> 0:32:14,788
in cases of visual illusions,
can be wrong but will guide you


552
0:32:14,788 --> 0:32:18,45
to perceive the world in a
correct and accurate way.


553
0:32:18,45 --> 0:32:22,359
So for example,
there is binocular disparity.


554
0:32:22,359 --> 0:32:24,89
This is actually a sort of
interesting one.


555
0:32:24,89 --> 0:32:27,829
This is the only depth cue that
involves two eyes.


556
0:32:27,829 --> 0:32:32,965
If I look at you pretty close,
the image I get here and the


557
0:32:32,965 --> 0:32:38,101
image I get here are somewhat
different while--or I have to


558
0:32:38,101 --> 0:32:42,44
focus my eyes together to get
the same image.


559
0:32:42,44 --> 0:32:45,278
If I look at you in back,
they're almost identical


560
0:32:45,278 --> 0:32:48,29
because the further away,
given the two eyes that are


561
0:32:48,29 --> 0:32:50,549
static, the closer the images
look.


562
0:32:50,549 --> 0:32:52,368
And it's not,
again, that you say to


563
0:32:52,368 --> 0:32:55,17
yourself, "Oh.
Back there an orange.


564
0:32:55,17 --> 0:32:57,43
It's the same image in my right
eye and my left eye.


565
0:32:57,43 --> 0:33:0,714
You must be far away."
Rather, unconsciously and


566
0:33:0,714 --> 0:33:4,68
automatically you make
estimations on how far people


567
0:33:4,68 --> 0:33:8,18
are in depth based on binocular
disparity.


568
0:33:8,18 --> 0:33:12,62
There is "interposition."
How do you know I'm in front of


569
0:33:12,62 --> 0:33:14,87
the podium and the podium's not
in front of me?


570
0:33:14,87 --> 0:33:17,716
No.
How do you know the podium's in


571
0:33:17,716 --> 0:33:20,68
front of me?
Well, from where I'm standing


572
0:33:20,68 --> 0:33:22,58
it's right.
How do you know the podium is


573
0:33:22,58 --> 0:33:26,165
in front of me?
Well, because I'm walking here


574
0:33:26,165 --> 0:33:30,855
and then it cuts into me.
And unless I'm going through a


575
0:33:30,855 --> 0:33:33,897
grotesque metamorphosis,
what's happening is it makes


576
0:33:33,897 --> 0:33:36,53
sense to say I'm moving behind
the podium.


577
0:33:36,53 --> 0:33:38,38
Interposition.
You take the guy.


578
0:33:38,38 --> 0:33:40,74
How do you know the guy is
standing in front of the house?


579
0:33:40,74 --> 0:33:47,633
Well, because there is--you see
all of him and he's blocking a


580
0:33:47,633 --> 0:33:51,75
lot of the house.
There's relative size.


581
0:33:51,75 --> 0:33:55,58
How far away am I?
Well, if you looked at me and


582
0:33:55,58 --> 0:33:59,235
you had to estimate how far away
I am, part of the way you'll


583
0:33:59,235 --> 0:34:3,759
figure that out is you know how
tall a human's supposed to be.


584
0:34:3,759 --> 0:34:8,891
If you thought that I was fifty
feet tall, you would assume I'm


585
0:34:8,891 --> 0:34:13,29
further away than I am.
And so, your judgments on size


586
0:34:13,29 --> 0:34:16,32
dictate your judgments about
distance.


587
0:34:16,32 --> 0:34:19,971
Usually, this cue isn't
necessary but if you look at the


588
0:34:19,971 --> 0:34:24,221
Empire State Building--If you go
into a field and you see a tower


589
0:34:24,221 --> 0:34:27,627
and you look,
your judgment of how far away


590
0:34:27,627 --> 0:34:32,497
the tower's going to be depends
on your knowledge of how tall a


591
0:34:32,497 --> 0:34:36,159
tower should be.
If it's this tall, you say, "Oh.


592
0:34:36,159 --> 0:34:38,76
It must be--" And then you'd be
surprised.


593
0:34:38,76 --> 0:34:44,322
There's texture gradient,
which I'll explain in a second,


594
0:34:44,322 --> 0:34:49,387
and linear perspective,
which I'll also explain in a


595
0:34:49,387 --> 0:34:52,21
second.
Texture gradient goes like this.


596
0:34:52,21 --> 0:34:54,59
Remember the problem we had
before.


597
0:34:54,59 --> 0:35:0,691
How do you know if that thing
is this object or an object in


598
0:35:0,691 --> 0:35:4,732
and of itself?
Well, the answer is things with


599
0:35:4,732 --> 0:35:8,927
textures will show themselves
because the textures will get


600
0:35:8,927 --> 0:35:11,827
smaller from a distance.
Now, logically,


601
0:35:11,827 --> 0:35:15,619
this could still be a single
thing standing upright with just


602
0:35:15,619 --> 0:35:19,442
dots going up smaller.
But the natural assumption is


603
0:35:19,442 --> 0:35:23,771
the reason why the dots recede
in this regular fashion is


604
0:35:23,771 --> 0:35:28,963
because it's receding in depth.
Classic illusion – the


605
0:35:28,963 --> 0:35:34,191
Mueller-Lyer illusion.
People will see this as longer


606
0:35:34,191 --> 0:35:36,32
than this .
It's not.


607
0:35:36,32 --> 0:35:39,769
If you don't believe me,
print it out and measure it.


608
0:35:39,769 --> 0:35:44,186
Related to the Ponzo illusion,
once again people see this one


609
0:35:44,186 --> 0:35:48,161
as--you get illusions named
after you when you discover


610
0:35:48,161 --> 0:35:51,18
these--this one as longer than
this .


611
0:35:51,18 --> 0:35:53,94
Again, it's not.
What's going on here?


612
0:35:53,94 --> 0:35:59,17
Well, the top line looks longer
even though it isn't.


613
0:35:59,17 --> 0:36:4,321
And one explanation for why is,
these other lines in the scene


614
0:36:4,321 --> 0:36:9,219
cause your visual system to make
guesses about distance.


615
0:36:9,219 --> 0:36:13,894
And then you correct for
distance by making assumptions


616
0:36:13,894 --> 0:36:16,713
about size.
If you have two lines--You'll


617
0:36:16,713 --> 0:36:20,275
get--We'll get in more detail in
a second, but if you have two


618
0:36:20,275 --> 0:36:24,13
lines and they take up the same
amount of space on your retina,


619
0:36:24,13 --> 0:36:28,1
but you believe that one is 100
feet away and the other's 50


620
0:36:28,1 --> 0:36:32,206
feet away, the one that's 100
feet away you will see as bigger


621
0:36:32,206 --> 0:36:36,109
because your brain will say,
"Well, if it takes up just this


622
0:36:36,109 --> 0:36:39,213
much space but it's further
away, it must be bigger than


623
0:36:39,213 --> 0:36:42,43
something that's closer and
takes up that much space."


624
0:36:42,43 --> 0:36:45,568
And that's what goes on here.
For the top line,


625
0:36:45,568 --> 0:36:49,656
for the Mueller-Lyer illusion,
we assume that this is further


626
0:36:49,656 --> 0:36:53,54
away and this is closer based on
the cues to distance.


627
0:36:53,54 --> 0:36:57,449
And the cue is factored in.
And because we assume that this


628
0:36:57,449 --> 0:37:0,535
is further away,
we assume it must be bigger to


629
0:37:0,535 --> 0:37:3,889
take up the same space as this
which is closer.


630
0:37:3,889 --> 0:37:5,94
Similarly for the Ponzo
illusion.


631
0:37:5,94 --> 0:37:9,55
There's linear perspective.
Parallel lines tend to recede


632
0:37:9,55 --> 0:37:12,649
in distance.
If this top one is further away


633
0:37:12,649 --> 0:37:16,589
than this but they take up the
same size in your eye,


634
0:37:16,589 --> 0:37:20,53
this one must be bigger and you
see it as bigger.


635
0:37:20,53 --> 0:37:25,142
And the book offers more
details on how these illusions


636
0:37:25,142 --> 0:37:27,101
work.
I'm going to end with an


637
0:37:27,101 --> 0:37:30,219
illusion that I'm not even going
to bother explaining.


638
0:37:30,219 --> 0:37:32,97
I'll just show it to you
because you should be able to,


639
0:37:32,97 --> 0:37:35,263
based on thinking about these
other illusions,


640
0:37:35,263 --> 0:37:37,496
figure it out.
It was developed by Roger


641
0:37:37,496 --> 0:37:40,79
Shepard.
Well, you know that.


642
0:37:40,79 --> 0:37:42,829
And they are called Shepard
tables .


643
0:37:42,829 --> 0:37:45,63
And the thing about it is,
these look like two tables.


644
0:37:45,63 --> 0:37:48,31
If you ask people--You don't
frame in terms of here's a


645
0:37:48,31 --> 0:37:50,648
lecture on visual perception.
You ask people,


646
0:37:50,648 --> 0:37:53,949
"Which of these tables would be
easier to get through a door if


647
0:37:53,949 --> 0:37:56,746
you have a thin door?"
People would say the one on the


648
0:37:56,746 --> 0:37:58,977
left.
This one looks sort of thicker


649
0:37:58,977 --> 0:38:1,919
and harder to get through.
This one looks longer and


650
0:38:1,919 --> 0:38:4,579
leaner.
In fact, they're the same size.


651
0:38:4,579 --> 0:38:13,429
What I mean by that is that
this is exactly the same as this


652
0:38:13,429 --> 0:38:15,681
.
Now, I'm going to prove it to


653
0:38:15,681 --> 0:38:19,283
you by showing you something
which took me--on the computer


654
0:38:19,283 --> 0:38:21,829
which took me about seven hours
to do.


655
0:38:21,829 --> 0:38:24,85
And nobody's going to believe
it because I could have faked


656
0:38:24,85 --> 0:38:25,315
it.
But if you want,


657
0:38:25,315 --> 0:38:27,449
print it out and do it
yourself.


658
0:38:27,449 --> 0:38:29,48
You just take a piece of paper,
put it on here.


659
0:38:29,48 --> 0:38:38,178
Then you move it and the same.
I showed it to somebody and


660
0:38:38,178 --> 0:38:41,856
they called me a liar.
Anyway, you could do it


661
0:38:41,856 --> 0:38:45,84
yourself in the privacy of your
own home or study.


662
0:38:45,84 --> 0:38:50,847
But what I'd really like you to
do after you do it is say,


663
0:38:50,847 --> 0:38:52,219
"Okay.
Fine.


664
0:38:52,219 --> 0:38:55,65
Why does this one look longer
and thinner than this one?"


665
0:38:55,65 --> 0:38:58,505
And the answer is the same
answer that will explain the


666
0:38:58,505 --> 0:39:0,989
Mueller-Lyer illusion and the
Ponzo illusion,


667
0:39:0,989 --> 0:39:6,627
having to do with cues to depth
and the way your mind corrects


668
0:39:6,627 --> 0:39:12,563
the perception of depth.
And that's all I have to say at


669
0:39:12,563 --> 0:39:18,479
this point about perception.
I want to move now to attention


670
0:39:18,479 --> 0:39:22,94
and memory and I'm going to
treat attention and memory


671
0:39:22,94 --> 0:39:26,41
together.
We are fascinated with memory


672
0:39:26,41 --> 0:39:30,483
and, in particular,
it's particularly interesting


673
0:39:30,483 --> 0:39:35,7
when memory goes wrong.
It's particularly fascinating


674
0:39:35,7 --> 0:39:39,23
what happens in cases of
amnesia.


675
0:39:39,23 --> 0:39:42,555
So for example,
I need a volunteer who is


676
0:39:42,555 --> 0:39:47,128
willing to do a little bit of
acting, a very little bit,


677
0:39:47,128 --> 0:39:50,33
an incredibly little bit.
Excellent.


678
0:39:50,33 --> 0:39:51,83
Okay.
So well, you just stay there.


679
0:39:51,83 --> 0:39:54,64
So pretend you have amnesia.
Okay?


680
0:39:54,64 --> 0:40:0,1
What's your name?
Student: I don't know.


681
0:40:0,1 --> 0:40:0,83
Professor Paul Bloom:
Perfect.


682
0:40:0,83 --> 0:40:3,58
I'm really glad you said that.
That's the wrong answer because


683
0:40:3,58 --> 0:40:6,72
you don't have total amnesia.
You still remember English.


684
0:40:6,72 --> 0:40:9,23
Okay.
It's very clever.


685
0:40:9,23 --> 0:40:12,52
Okay.
So you couldn't have lost all


686
0:40:12,52 --> 0:40:14,33
your memories.
You have English.


687
0:40:14,33 --> 0:40:19,29
You --So we'll do you.
What's your name?


688
0:40:19,29 --> 0:40:22,416
Oh.
He looks puzzled but he still


689
0:40:22,416 --> 0:40:27,107
maintains bowel and bladder
control so he hasn't forgotten


690
0:40:27,107 --> 0:40:29,185
everything.
[laughter]


691
0:40:29,185 --> 0:40:34,9
Now, I always lose the third
volunteer in that demo.


692
0:40:34,9 --> 0:40:40,31
So, what I'm saying is that
memory is a hugely broad


693
0:40:40,31 --> 0:40:43,367
concept.
It includes autobiographical


694
0:40:43,367 --> 0:40:46,19
memory, which is what we
standardly think.


695
0:40:46,19 --> 0:40:48,679
That's a perfectly rational
response.


696
0:40:48,679 --> 0:40:50,86
When I say somebody's losing
their memory,


697
0:40:50,86 --> 0:40:52,539
"Oh.
I have a movie about somebody


698
0:40:52,539 --> 0:40:55,4
losing their memory," you don't
imagine a person in diapers.


699
0:40:55,4 --> 0:40:58,394
You imagine the person walking
around, having sex with cool


700
0:40:58,394 --> 0:41:0,15
people and saying,
"Where am I?"


701
0:41:0,15 --> 0:41:3,123
And [laughter]
so what you imagine is you


702
0:41:3,123 --> 0:41:6,765
imagine them losing their
autobiographical memory,


703
0:41:6,765 --> 0:41:9,535
their sense of self.
But of course,


704
0:41:9,535 --> 0:41:13,9
knowing English is part of your
memory and knowing how to stand


705
0:41:13,9 --> 0:41:17,702
and knowing how to chew and
swallow are all things that


706
0:41:17,702 --> 0:41:20,741
you've learned,
that you've--that have been


707
0:41:20,741 --> 0:41:23,744
molded by experience.
There's another distinction


708
0:41:23,744 --> 0:41:26,411
which is going to come in
regarding amnesia,


709
0:41:26,411 --> 0:41:29,449
which is there's broadly two
types of amnesia.


710
0:41:29,449 --> 0:41:33,496
They often run together,
but one type of amnesia is you


711
0:41:33,496 --> 0:41:38,435
lose your memory of the past.
Another type of amnesia--That's


712
0:41:38,435 --> 0:41:42,836
the Matt Damon amnesia.
Another type of amnesia though


713
0:41:42,836 --> 0:41:46,48
is you lose the ability to form
new memories.


714
0:41:46,48 --> 0:41:51,23
And here's a film of a man who
had exactly this problem.


715
0:41:51,23 --> 0:41:55,896
He was a world-renowned choir
director and he suffered viral


716
0:41:55,896 --> 0:42:0,72
encephalitis which led to brain
damage which destroyed most of


717
0:42:0,72 --> 0:42:3,515
his temporal lobes,
his hippocampus,


718
0:42:3,515 --> 0:42:5,71
and a lot of his left frontal
lobe.


719
0:42:5,71 --> 0:42:9,702
It could be--It could have been
worse in that he retains the


720
0:42:9,702 --> 0:42:12,306
ability to talk.
He seems to be--He's not


721
0:42:12,306 --> 0:42:16,578
intellectually impaired.
He just can't form new memories


722
0:42:16,578 --> 0:42:21,48
and so he lives in this
perpetual "now" where just


723
0:42:21,48 --> 0:42:25,792
nothing affects him and he
feels--This has not always


724
0:42:25,792 --> 0:42:28,932
happened.
There's more than one of these


725
0:42:28,932 --> 0:42:31,663
cases and it doesn't always
happen like this,


726
0:42:31,663 --> 0:42:34,829
but he feels continually reborn
at every moment.


727
0:42:34,829 --> 0:42:40,44
And we'll return to this and
then ask what's going on here.


728
0:42:40,44 --> 0:42:44,33
But there's a few themes here.
I want to, before getting into


729
0:42:44,33 --> 0:42:46,685
detail about memory,
I want to review some basic


730
0:42:46,685 --> 0:42:49,619
distinctions in memory when we
talk about memory.


731
0:42:49,619 --> 0:42:53,137
So crudely, you could make a
distinction between sensory


732
0:42:53,137 --> 0:42:56,719
memory, short-term memory,
which is also known as working


733
0:42:56,719 --> 0:43:0,65
memory, and long-term memory.
Sensory memory is a residue in


734
0:43:0,65 --> 0:43:3,56
your senses.
There's a flash of lightning.


735
0:43:3,56 --> 0:43:8,28
You might see an afterimage.
That afterimage is your sensory


736
0:43:8,28 --> 0:43:11,114
memory.
There's somewhat of a longer


737
0:43:11,114 --> 0:43:14,744
echoic memory for sounds.
So as somebody is talking to


738
0:43:14,744 --> 0:43:17,929
you even if you're not paying
attention you'll store a few


739
0:43:17,929 --> 0:43:20,703
seconds of what they're saying,
which is sometimes,


740
0:43:20,703 --> 0:43:23,554
when somebody's talking to you
and you're not listening to them


741
0:43:23,554 --> 0:43:25,7
and they say,
"You're not listening to me."


742
0:43:25,7 --> 0:43:28,455
And you say, "No.
You were talking about--" and


743
0:43:28,455 --> 0:43:31,69
pick up the last couple of
seconds from echoic memory.


744
0:43:31,69 --> 0:43:37,368
There's short-term memory.
Anybody remember what I just


745
0:43:37,368 --> 0:43:40,602
said?
If you did, that's short-term


746
0:43:40,602 --> 0:43:44,983
memory--spans for a few minutes.
And then there's long-term


747
0:43:44,983 --> 0:43:46,98
memory.
Anybody know who Elvis is?


748
0:43:46,98 --> 0:43:49,469
Do you know your name?
Do you know where you live?


749
0:43:49,469 --> 0:43:53,252
Your long-term memory store
that you walk around with and


750
0:43:53,252 --> 0:43:55,82
you're not going to lose right
away.


751
0:43:55,82 --> 0:43:59,487
When we think about amnesia in
the movie sense,


752
0:43:59,487 --> 0:44:4,35
we think of a certain loss of
long-term memory associated with


753
0:44:4,35 --> 0:44:7,3
autobiographical personal
events.


754
0:44:7,3 --> 0:44:10,129
There is a distinction between
implicit and explicit,


755
0:44:10,129 --> 0:44:12,469
which we'll talk about it in
more detail.


756
0:44:12,469 --> 0:44:14,851
But explicit,
crudely, is what you have


757
0:44:14,851 --> 0:44:18,611
conscious access to.
So, what you had for dinner


758
0:44:18,611 --> 0:44:21,115
last night.
You could think back and say,


759
0:44:21,115 --> 0:44:22,91
"I had this for dinner last
night."


760
0:44:22,91 --> 0:44:25,7
Implicit is more unconscious.


761
0:44:25,7 --> 0:44:28,63



762
0:44:28,63 --> 0:44:32,452
What the word--what certain
word--what the word "had" means,


763
0:44:32,452 --> 0:44:34,849
how to walk,
how to ride a bicycle,


764
0:44:34,849 --> 0:44:39,41
that you might not be able to
articulate and might not even be


765
0:44:39,41 --> 0:44:41,789
conscious of but still have
access to.


766
0:44:41,789 --> 0:44:45,581
There's a distinction between
semantic memory and episodic


767
0:44:45,581 --> 0:44:48,903
memory.
Semantic memory is basically


768
0:44:48,903 --> 0:44:54,155
facts, what a word means,
what's the capital of Canada,


769
0:44:54,155 --> 0:44:57,724
and so on.
Episodic is autobiography,


770
0:44:57,724 --> 0:45:5,24
is what happened to you.
That Yale is in New Haven is


771
0:45:5,24 --> 0:45:9,613
semantic.
That you went on vacation away


772
0:45:9,613 --> 0:45:14,5
from New Haven last week,
it would be episodic.


773
0:45:14,5 --> 0:45:18,222
There is encoding stores and
retrieval, which refers to


774
0:45:18,222 --> 0:45:21,699
different levels of what happens
in memory.


775
0:45:21,699 --> 0:45:26,288
Encoding is getting the memory
in, as when you study for a test


776
0:45:26,288 --> 0:45:30,73
or you have an experience.
And storage is holding the


777
0:45:30,73 --> 0:45:34,371
memory.
And retrieval is getting the


778
0:45:34,371 --> 0:45:37,603
memory out.
Finally, retrieval is often


779
0:45:37,603 --> 0:45:41,57
broken, conveniently,
into recall versus recognition,


780
0:45:41,57 --> 0:45:45,3
where recall is when you just
pull it out of memory and


781
0:45:45,3 --> 0:45:48,363
recognition is when you
recognize what corresponds to


782
0:45:48,363 --> 0:45:52,222
something in the past.
Anybody remember what color tie


783
0:45:52,222 --> 0:45:55,11
I had on two days ago?
Oh.


784
0:45:55,11 --> 0:46:0,25
Okay.
Well, that would be impossible


785
0:46:0,25 --> 0:46:3,75
to remember but if I asked you,
"Is it purple or is it orange?"


786
0:46:3,75 --> 0:46:12,52
that would be much easier.
[laughter]


787
0:46:12,52 --> 0:46:16,509
Now, you could break up,
crudely, the memory into


788
0:46:16,509 --> 0:46:18,986
stages.
So you start that sensory


789
0:46:18,986 --> 0:46:22,871
memory is just the stuff that
comes in leading to short-term


790
0:46:22,871 --> 0:46:25,44
memory, leading to long-term
memory.


791
0:46:25,44 --> 0:46:29,96
And this stage theory is
something which we'll discuss in


792
0:46:29,96 --> 0:46:33,753
more detail.
But this leads us to the issue


793
0:46:33,753 --> 0:46:37,526
of attention.
How do you get memory from your


794
0:46:37,526 --> 0:46:40,1
sensations, from what you're
hearing?


795
0:46:40,1 --> 0:46:42,199
I'm speaking to you.
You're hearing me.


796
0:46:42,199 --> 0:46:45,389
How does it ever get in to the
other systems?


797
0:46:45,389 --> 0:46:47,59
What decides what's remembered
and what's not?


798
0:46:47,59 --> 0:46:49,84
There's all sorts of things
happening to you now.


799
0:46:49,84 --> 0:46:55,31
The seat of your chair is
pressing against your butt.


800
0:46:55,31 --> 0:46:57,469
You wouldn't say, "Oh.
I want to remember this forever.


801
0:46:57,469 --> 0:47:0,239
The seat's pressing against my
butt."


802
0:47:0,239 --> 0:47:2,94
[laughter]
Your neighbor is exuding a


803
0:47:2,94 --> 0:47:5,4
certain sort of smell.
You're thinking about something.


804
0:47:5,4 --> 0:47:7,489
Your eyes follow him.
Not everything gets in memory.


805
0:47:7,489 --> 0:47:10,7
You'd go mad if you tried to
remember everything.


806
0:47:10,7 --> 0:47:13,553
You can't.
So, what determines what gets


807
0:47:13,553 --> 0:47:17,736
into memory?
Well, one answer is "attention


808
0:47:17,736 --> 0:47:20,723
does."
And attention is--could be


809
0:47:20,723 --> 0:47:26,57
crudely viewed as a flashlight,
a spotlight on experience that


810
0:47:26,57 --> 0:47:31,13
willingly zooms in on something
and makes it memorable.


811
0:47:31,13 --> 0:47:33,39
Attention has certain
properties.


812
0:47:33,39 --> 0:47:36,325
Some things come from
attention--to attention


813
0:47:36,325 --> 0:47:40,67
effortlessly and automatically.
Here's an example.


814
0:47:40,67 --> 0:47:43,8
You're going to see an array of
letters here.


815
0:47:43,8 --> 0:47:49,704
One of them's going to be green.
When you see the green one,


816
0:47:49,704 --> 0:47:53,417
please clap.
[laughter]


817
0:47:53,417 --> 0:47:57,922
No, not this green one.
[laughter]


818
0:47:57,922 --> 0:48:1,36
There's going to be another
slide.


819
0:48:1,36 --> 0:48:10,71
Okay.
You're ready now.


820
0:48:10,71 --> 0:48:16,11
but there's going to be an "o."
When you see it clap.


821
0:48:16,11 --> 0:48:19,54
Okay.
Sometimes it's work.


822
0:48:19,54 --> 0:48:35,71
Find the red "o."
[laughter] It's harder.


823
0:48:35,71 --> 0:48:40,29
Sometimes attention is
involuntary.


824
0:48:40,29 --> 0:48:45,125
I need a volunteer.
And all I want to do is I want


825
0:48:45,125 --> 0:48:48,356
to show you colors on the screen
and I'd like you to name the


826
0:48:48,356 --> 0:48:49,81
colors as they come out.


827
0:48:49,81 --> 0:48:52,86



828
0:48:52,86 --> 0:48:54,249
Do you want this?
Student 1: I'm


829
0:48:54,249 --> 0:48:57,559
colorblind.
Professor Paul Bloom: Oh.


830
0:48:57,559 --> 0:48:58,629
[laughter]
The first one is easy.


831
0:48:58,629 --> 0:48:59,511
See.
This is--You have to just go


832
0:48:59,511 --> 0:49:1,49
down the colors .
Anybody?


833
0:49:1,49 --> 0:49:7,185
Okay.
Student 2: Red,


834
0:49:7,185 --> 0:49:8,567
green, blue,
black, green,


835
0:49:8,567 --> 0:49:10,28
blue, red, blue,
black, red.


836
0:49:10,28 --> 0:49:15,76
Professor Paul Bloom:
Excellent.


837
0:49:15,76 --> 0:49:17,61
[applause] Okay.
Now these.


838
0:49:17,61 --> 0:49:20,76
These will be words but just
name--Okay, you.


839
0:49:20,76 --> 0:49:25,637
Just name the colors.
Student 3: Green,


840
0:49:25,637 --> 0:49:28,963
red, blue, black,
blue, red, green,


841
0:49:28,963 --> 0:49:31,646
black, red, blue.
Professor Paul Bloom:


842
0:49:31,646 --> 0:49:33,753
Perfect.
Now, we'll go back to you,


843
0:49:33,753 --> 0:49:35,822
same deal, words.
Student 4: Red,


844
0:49:35,822 --> 0:49:37,438
blue, green -- Professor
Paul Bloom: No,


845
0:49:37,438 --> 0:49:38,3
no, no.
Huh uh.


846
0:49:38,3 --> 0:49:41,94
Don't--I know you can read.
The colors.


847
0:49:41,94 --> 0:49:43,39
Student 4: Okay.
Sorry.


848
0:49:43,39 --> 0:49:45,206
Okay.
Blue, green,


849
0:49:45,206 --> 0:49:48,545
red, green, black,
green, blue,


850
0:49:48,545 --> 0:49:55,559
black, red, Professor Paul
Bloom: Very good actually.


851
0:49:55,559 --> 0:49:59,599
[laughter]
That's known as the Stroop


852
0:49:59,599 --> 0:50:2,566
effect.
Being an expert reader,


853
0:50:2,566 --> 0:50:7,67
as you are, your knowledge of
reading, your attention to what


854
0:50:7,67 --> 0:50:11,669
the words meant,
subverted your desire to do the


855
0:50:11,669 --> 0:50:14,24
task.
You couldn't make that go away


856
0:50:14,24 --> 0:50:17,453
even if you wanted to.
If somebody gave you $1,000 to


857
0:50:17,453 --> 0:50:21,113
read this as fast as you read
this, and as fast as you read


858
0:50:21,113 --> 0:50:24,78
this, you'd be unable to.
You can't block it.


859
0:50:24,78 --> 0:50:29,621
There is some work--There are
some interesting discoveries


860
0:50:29,621 --> 0:50:32,88
about attention.
I have a demonstration here.


861
0:50:32,88 --> 0:50:36,135
I'd like people actually--It's
important--Some of you may have


862
0:50:36,135 --> 0:50:39,143
seen this before.
It's important for you to be


863
0:50:39,143 --> 0:50:42,208
silent throughout it.
What you're going to see is


864
0:50:42,208 --> 0:50:45,15
you're going to see two teams of
basketball players.


865
0:50:45,15 --> 0:50:52,38
One of them is going to have
white T-shirts.


866
0:50:52,38 --> 0:50:54,719
The other one will have black
T-shirts.


867
0:50:54,719 --> 0:50:57,75
They'll be passing balls back
and forth.


868
0:50:57,75 --> 0:51:2,591
What I'd like you to do is
count in your head how many


869
0:51:2,591 --> 0:51:6,519
passes the white team does with
the ball.


870
0:51:6,519 --> 0:51:7,83
[laughter]
What number did people get?


871
0:51:7,83 --> 0:51:12,434
Okay.
Did anybody notice anything


872
0:51:12,434 --> 0:51:13,777
unusual?
[laughter]


873
0:51:13,777 --> 0:51:15,49
Did anybody not notice anything
unusual?


874
0:51:15,49 --> 0:51:18,742
Okay.
Some people did not notice


875
0:51:18,742 --> 0:51:22,501
anything unusual.
Those who didn't see anything


876
0:51:22,501 --> 0:51:26,71
unusual, watch this again and
just watch it.


877
0:51:26,71 --> 0:51:28,869
[laughter]
About 50% of people when


878
0:51:28,869 --> 0:51:32,234
counting, who have never seen
this before don't notice


879
0:51:32,234 --> 0:51:34,208
anything.
But then when you're not


880
0:51:34,208 --> 0:51:36,65
counting it's kind of obvious
what you're missing.


881
0:51:36,65 --> 0:51:52,4



882
0:51:52,4 --> 0:51:55,551
[laughter]
And this is one demonstration


883
0:51:55,551 --> 0:52:0,481
among many of the fact that when
you're attending to something


884
0:52:0,481 --> 0:52:5,572
you have a very small window of
attention and you lose the focus


885
0:52:5,572 --> 0:52:10,993
on other things.
Here's another different


886
0:52:10,993 --> 0:52:13,924
example.
I'd like people to watch a


887
0:52:13,924 --> 0:52:17,414
movie and pay attention very
closely to what happens in the


888
0:52:17,414 --> 0:52:20,702
movie and try to remember this.
How many of you noticed


889
0:52:20,702 --> 0:52:24,32
something odd in that movie?
How many of you didn't?


890
0:52:24,32 --> 0:52:29,18
Okay.
Now, everybody look at the


891
0:52:29,18 --> 0:52:33,564
scarf, the color of the plates
and the food,


892
0:52:33,564 --> 0:52:36,94
among other things.
The phenomena,


893
0:52:36,94 --> 0:52:40,539
in general, has been called
"change blindness."


894
0:52:40,539 --> 0:52:44,109
And what it is is we tend to
be--when there's a focus of


895
0:52:44,109 --> 0:52:46,51
attention focused in a certain
way,


896
0:52:46,51 --> 0:52:49,773
we tend to be oblivious to
other things that go on in the


897
0:52:49,773 --> 0:52:51,497
environment.
Often it is,


898
0:52:51,497 --> 0:52:55,806
in fact, quite difficult when
there's a change in scene to


899
0:52:55,806 --> 0:52:59,36
notice what changes and what
stays the same.


900
0:52:59,36 --> 0:53:7,634
So, in this final demo,
there's just going to be two


901
0:53:7,634 --> 0:53:12,21
pictures flicking.
Could you clap when you see


902
0:53:12,21 --> 0:53:13,84
what's different between the two
pictures?


903
0:53:13,84 --> 0:53:30,84



904
0:53:30,84 --> 0:53:31,475
[applause]
[laughter]


905
0:53:31,475 --> 0:53:33,51
I myself am terrible at these
and so I have a lot of sympathy.


906
0:53:33,51 --> 0:53:34,63
How many people never saw it?


907
0:53:34,63 --> 0:53:46,8



908
0:53:46,8 --> 0:53:56,57
[laughter] Good.
That's very impressive.


909
0:53:56,57 --> 0:53:57,543
[laughter]
One more time with a different


910
0:53:57,543 --> 0:53:57,69
one.


911
0:53:57,69 --> 0:54:14,65



912
0:54:14,65 --> 0:54:16,7
[applause]
Did anybody not see it?


913
0:54:16,7 --> 0:54:18,54
Be honest.
I'll give you another try.


914
0:54:18,54 --> 0:54:33,88



915
0:54:33,88 --> 0:54:35,92
[applause] Okay.
I'll put you out of your misery.


916
0:54:35,92 --> 0:54:45,46



917
0:54:45,46 --> 0:54:48,721
[laughter]
This is work by Dan Simons and


918
0:54:48,721 --> 0:54:53,45
it's part of an extraordinarily
interesting body of work on


919
0:54:53,45 --> 0:54:56,63
what's known as "change
blindness."


920
0:54:56,63 --> 0:55:0,156
And what this means is,
the phenomena is,


921
0:55:0,156 --> 0:55:5,446
we have a very narrow focus of
attention and huge changes can


922
0:55:5,446 --> 0:55:9,274
happen that we are oblivious to.
This is why,


923
0:55:9,274 --> 0:55:12,11
in movies, there are so
many--so much difficulty with


924
0:55:12,11 --> 0:55:15,327
continuity changes.
Dan Simons is also famous for


925
0:55:15,327 --> 0:55:19,5
having brought this outside of
the laboratory in some classic


926
0:55:19,5 --> 0:55:23,534
experiments and I'm trying to
get the film corresponding to


927
0:55:23,534 --> 0:55:25,786
them.
What he did was that he did


928
0:55:25,786 --> 0:55:29,36
this great study in the Cornell
campus where he was--where what


929
0:55:29,36 --> 0:55:32,704
happened is they would get some
unsuspecting person walking


930
0:55:32,704 --> 0:55:35,99
through campus and some guy
would come over and say,


931
0:55:35,99 --> 0:55:38,76
"Excuse me, Sir.
I'm lost.


932
0:55:38,76 --> 0:55:40,86
Could you help me with
directions?"


933
0:55:40,86 --> 0:55:43,234
And have a map and then the
person would say,


934
0:55:43,234 --> 0:55:45,88
"Sure."
And then there'd be two


935
0:55:45,88 --> 0:55:47,289
construction workers holding a
door.


936
0:55:47,289 --> 0:55:51,113
And these guys were going to
rudely bump between these two


937
0:55:51,113 --> 0:55:54,736
characters and then the
experimenter gets switched with


938
0:55:54,736 --> 0:55:57,18
another guy.
So now, when these two guys


939
0:55:57,18 --> 0:56:0,24
walk away, the subject is
standing there with an entirely


940
0:56:0,24 --> 0:56:2,356
different person.
[laughter]


941
0:56:2,356 --> 0:56:7,36
What's interesting is nobody
notices.


942
0:56:7,36 --> 0:56:9,659
[laughter]
They notice if the person


943
0:56:9,659 --> 0:56:13,69
changes sexes.
"Didn't you used to be a woman?"


944
0:56:13,69 --> 0:56:16,18
[laughter]
And they notice if the


945
0:56:16,18 --> 0:56:20,616
experimenter changes races,
but most other changes they're


946
0:56:20,616 --> 0:56:23,329
oblivious to.
There's another experiment.


947
0:56:23,329 --> 0:56:27,619
I think Brian Scholl did this
one but it may have been Dan


948
0:56:27,619 --> 0:56:32,21
Simons where what happens is a
subject comes in to the lab.


949
0:56:32,21 --> 0:56:35,795
They say, "If you're going to
do an experiment with us,


950
0:56:35,795 --> 0:56:38,65
you need to sign the human
subject form."


951
0:56:38,65 --> 0:56:40,44
Hands him the form,
the experimenter.


952
0:56:40,44 --> 0:56:43,147
The subject signs the form.
The experimenter takes the form


953
0:56:43,147 --> 0:56:45,119
and says, "Thank you.
I'll put it down here."


954
0:56:45,119 --> 0:56:49,14
Goes down here and then a
different person pops up.


955
0:56:49,14 --> 0:56:53,328
[laughter] People don't notice.
And there's a certain level on


956
0:56:53,328 --> 0:56:56,7
which we're oblivious to
changes.


957
0:56:56,7 --> 0:56:59,0
What's weird is we don't
see--we don't think we are.


958
0:56:59,0 --> 0:57:2,687
We think we see the world as it
is and we don't know--notice


959
0:57:2,687 --> 0:57:5,25
that when we're attending to
something;


960
0:57:5,25 --> 0:57:7,15
everything else gets blanked
out.


961
0:57:7,15 --> 0:57:10,902
And so about 50% of people who
have never seen this demo


962
0:57:10,902 --> 0:57:14,86
before, the gorilla demo,
they don't notice the gorilla.


963
0:57:14,86 --> 0:57:18,94
And there's--you couldn't
imagine anything more obvious.


964
0:57:18,94 --> 0:57:23,3
The gorilla study was actually
done a very long time ago.


965
0:57:23,3 --> 0:57:28,445
And it was originally done in a
different way but I'll show it


966
0:57:28,445 --> 0:57:33,949
to you just because this is the
original study and now that you


967
0:57:33,949 --> 0:57:37,64
all know what to expect--Oh,
not that one.


968
0:57:37,64 --> 0:57:45,199
Oops.
Nope.


969
0:57:45,199 --> 0:57:47,665
That's actually--If you looked
at that quickly,


970
0:57:47,665 --> 0:57:50,489
it's a current Yale professor.
Oh.


971
0:57:50,489 --> 0:57:52,739
I'm never going to get my DVD
back.


972
0:57:52,739 --> 0:58:1,6
Anyway, I'll show you the other
demo on--next week.


973
0:58:1,6 --> 0:58:5,409
I will.
[laughter]


974
0:58:5,409 --> 0:58:8,77
Any questions about attention
and memory at this point?


975
0:58:8,77 --> 0:58:13,171
Yeah.
Student: [inaudible]


976
0:58:13,171 --> 0:58:16,79
Professor Paul Bloom:
Yeah.


977
0:58:16,79 --> 0:58:20,947
Why does it work that way?
Why is it--Why do things that


978
0:58:20,947 --> 0:58:24,36
become very practiced become
automatic and involuntary?


979
0:58:24,36 --> 0:58:27,5
It's a good question.
I don't know.


980
0:58:27,5 --> 0:58:31,611
We know that they do.
We know that once you--that you


981
0:58:31,611 --> 0:58:34,96
can't not read once you know how
to read.


982
0:58:34,96 --> 0:58:40,144
You also can't not listen.
If I'm talking to you and I'm


983
0:58:40,144 --> 0:58:43,336
extremely boring,
but I'm talking to you,


984
0:58:43,336 --> 0:58:47,25
it's very hard not to listen.
You can't shut off your ears.


985
0:58:47,25 --> 0:58:50,309
You could put your fingers in
them but you can't shut off


986
0:58:50,309 --> 0:58:53,588
your--You also can't shut your
eyes without actually shutting


987
0:58:53,588 --> 0:58:54,864
them.
You can't say,


988
0:58:54,864 --> 0:59:0,539
"This is a disgusting movie.
I'm not going to attend to it."


989
0:59:0,539 --> 0:59:2,958
[laughter]
So, that's not answering your


990
0:59:2,958 --> 0:59:4,882
question.
It's just saying that your


991
0:59:4,882 --> 0:59:7,32
observation is a right one and a
more general one.


992
0:59:7,32 --> 0:59:11,34
When you're good at something
and you're over-practiced,


993
0:59:11,34 --> 0:59:14,85
it becomes involuntary and you
cannot stop it.


994
0:59:14,85 --> 0:59:16,99
Okay.
Well--Oh.


995
0:59:16,99 --> 0:59:19,619
One more in back.
Yes.


996
0:59:19,619 --> 0:59:21,53
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:


997
0:59:21,53 --> 0:59:22,5
What now?
Sorry.


998
0:59:22,5 --> 0:59:24,63
Over there.
Yeah.


999
0:59:24,63 --> 0:59:28,82
Student: [inaudible]
right before his accident?


1000
0:59:28,82 --> 0:59:30,379
Professor Paul Bloom:
Did he remember things before


1001
0:59:30,379 --> 0:59:31,889
his accident?
Yes.


1002
0:59:31,889 --> 0:59:35,422
He had some amnesia of events
before his accident but he did


1003
0:59:35,422 --> 0:59:37,929
remember things.
He knew his name and he knew


1004
0:59:37,929 --> 0:59:40,63
other things about his life.
Okay.


1005
0:59:40,63 --> 0:61:40,63
I'll see you next week.
