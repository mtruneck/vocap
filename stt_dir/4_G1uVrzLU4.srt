2
0:0:14,33 --> 0:0:15,58
SHANE SMITH: Hello.


3
0:0:15,58 --> 0:0:18,59



4
0:0:18,59 --> 0:0:21,99
The next morning we got back
onto our one-car train and


5
0:0:21,99 --> 0:0:23,24
headed off into the
wilderness.


6
0:0:23,24 --> 0:0:26,73



7
0:0:26,73 --> 0:0:28,89
Every once in a while, there'd
be a break in the trees, and


8
0:0:28,89 --> 0:0:31,31
we'd pass these massive logging
camps that butted up


9
0:0:31,31 --> 0:0:34,47
against the train tracks that
were obviously North Korean.


10
0:0:34,47 --> 0:0:36,45
We're on our little train
going into the


11
0:0:36,45 --> 0:0:37,72
middle of the forest.


12
0:0:37,72 --> 0:0:40,9
This is a logging camps
run by North Koreans.


13
0:0:40,9 --> 0:0:44,47
You can see there's a North
Korean flag and North Korean


14
0:0:44,47 --> 0:0:46,44
propaganda in here.


15
0:0:46,44 --> 0:0:47,6
There, there's some
North Koreans


16
0:0:47,6 --> 0:0:49,39
waving at us over there.


17
0:0:49,39 --> 0:0:51,48
All this wood is going
to England.


18
0:0:51,48 --> 0:0:55,98
When we get off this
train, [LAUGH]


19
0:0:55,98 --> 0:0:58,7
we're going to go out into the
campus where they actually log


20
0:0:58,7 --> 0:1:1,31
out in the middle of Siberia.


21
0:1:1,31 --> 0:1:2,56
Freaky, freaky business.


22
0:1:2,56 --> 0:1:7,744



23
0:1:7,744 --> 0:1:11,2
We finally started to approach
our last stop, the tiny


24
0:1:11,2 --> 0:1:12,936
logging town of Tataul.


25
0:1:12,936 --> 0:1:15,4
Now Tataul is a freaky place.


26
0:1:15,4 --> 0:1:17,38
It's as if the Soviets had
come up to the edge of


27
0:1:17,38 --> 0:1:20,41
civilization, then dropped off
their Stalinists apartment


28
0:1:20,41 --> 0:1:22,97
blocks in the middle of nowhere,
and then gotten back


29
0:1:22,97 --> 0:1:25,115
on the train and never
looked back.


30
0:1:25,115 --> 0:1:27,98
At the train station, we met
our new driver, a colorful


31
0:1:27,98 --> 0:1:31,4
local type known simply
as "the Fish."


32
0:1:31,4 --> 0:1:32,48
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He
just brought a


33
0:1:32,48 --> 0:1:34,17
shotgun into the car--


34
0:1:34,17 --> 0:1:34,85
[LAUGH]


35
0:1:34,85 --> 0:1:37,39
just in case.


36
0:1:37,39 --> 0:1:38,47
SHANE SMITH: Dog
in the sidecar.


37
0:1:38,47 --> 0:1:39,91
Dog in the sidecar.


38
0:1:39,91 --> 0:1:42,11
SIMON OSTROVSKY: It looks
like a Doberman.


39
0:1:42,11 --> 0:1:44,31
SHANE SMITH: His mouthful of
gold teeth and his shiny track


40
0:1:44,31 --> 0:1:46,17
suit confirmed what we
already suspected--


41
0:1:46,17 --> 0:1:50,36
the Fish and his crew
were the local mob.


42
0:1:50,36 --> 0:1:51,91
SIMON OSTROVSKY: They've
actually moved here from the


43
0:1:51,91 --> 0:1:55,4
camp, the abandoned camp that
we visited yesterday, so--


44
0:1:55,4 --> 0:1:57,89
SHANE SMITH: Right, so the
camp we were at is done.


45
0:1:57,89 --> 0:2:0,31
Now this is the new camp,
even further afield.


46
0:2:0,31 --> 0:2:0,94
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Right.


47
0:2:0,94 --> 0:2:3,7
Yeah, we're going to their new
camp, where they're actually


48
0:2:3,7 --> 0:2:4,32
operating now.


49
0:2:4,32 --> 0:2:5,35
SHANE SMITH: Ask him, maybe,
if he thinks if


50
0:2:5,35 --> 0:2:6,95
they'll be angry or--


51
0:2:6,95 --> 0:2:9,27
IGOR "THE FISH" RYBAKOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


52
0:2:9,27 --> 0:2:10,35
SHANE SMITH: [LAUGH]


53
0:2:10,35 --> 0:2:11,7
And he brought a shotgun.


54
0:2:11,7 --> 0:2:14,25
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yeah, I think
that's probably pretty useful.


55
0:2:14,25 --> 0:2:15,5
SHANE SMITH: Is this
the camp here?


56
0:2:15,5 --> 0:2:22,61



57
0:2:22,61 --> 0:2:27,6
So we're here in a North Korean
logging camp in the


58
0:2:27,6 --> 0:2:28,31
middle of Siberia.


59
0:2:28,31 --> 0:2:30,7



60
0:2:30,7 --> 0:2:32,78
SIMON OSTROVSKY: This is where
they bring the logs from the


61
0:2:32,78 --> 0:2:34,325
forest and put them
onto railcars.


62
0:2:34,325 --> 0:2:37,64



63
0:2:37,64 --> 0:2:40,42
SHANE SMITH: So there's
Korean propaganda.


64
0:2:40,42 --> 0:2:42,476
There's some Korean writing.


65
0:2:42,476 --> 0:2:45,8
SIMON OSTROVSKY: It says, "we're
going to take action to


66
0:2:45,8 --> 0:2:48,5
increase productivity during
the winter time."


67
0:2:48,5 --> 0:2:48,471
SHANE SMITH: [LAUGH]


68
0:2:48,471 --> 0:2:50,58
OK.


69
0:2:50,58 --> 0:2:52,831
Here comes a Russian lady that
we're going to have to--


70
0:2:52,831 --> 0:2:53,272
SIMON OSTROVSKY: She
doesn't look happy.


71
0:2:53,272 --> 0:2:53,713
SHANE SMITH: Hello.


72
0:2:53,713 --> 0:2:56,52
FEMALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


73
0:2:56,52 --> 0:2:58,63
SHANE SMITH: She immediately
made a lot of phone calls and


74
0:2:58,63 --> 0:3:0,73
a lot of threats.


75
0:3:0,73 --> 0:3:1,93
Should we get arrested?


76
0:3:1,93 --> 0:3:2,34
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yes.


77
0:3:2,34 --> 0:3:3,59
FEMALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


78
0:3:3,59 --> 0:3:16,81



79
0:3:16,81 --> 0:3:18,4
SHANE SMITH: While we were
arguing with her, a van


80
0:3:18,4 --> 0:3:21,68
straight out of 1957 pulled up,
and, lo and behold, out


81
0:3:21,68 --> 0:3:23,17
came some North Koreans.


82
0:3:23,17 --> 0:3:24,625
SIMON OSTROVSKY:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


83
0:3:24,625 --> 0:3:30,14



84
0:3:30,14 --> 0:3:31,25
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


85
0:3:31,25 --> 0:3:32,5
SIMON OSTROVSKY:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


86
0:3:32,5 --> 0:3:37,57



87
0:3:37,57 --> 0:3:39,36
SHANE SMITH: Jason's
gone AWOL.


88
0:3:39,36 --> 0:3:40,37
He's in the camp.


89
0:3:40,37 --> 0:3:44,45
Jason's being shuttled back to
fucking Pyongyang as we speak.


90
0:3:44,45 --> 0:3:47,49
Jason, our producer, slipped
away with a small camera and


91
0:3:47,49 --> 0:3:50,75
started filming the camp.


92
0:3:50,75 --> 0:3:52,0
SIMON OSTROVSKY:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


93
0:3:52,0 --> 0:3:55,82



94
0:3:55,82 --> 0:3:57,7
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


95
0:3:57,7 --> 0:4:5,7



96
0:4:5,7 --> 0:4:6,2
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He's saying
we've got to get permission


97
0:4:6,2 --> 0:4:8,75
from the embassy before
we can show anything.


98
0:4:8,75 --> 0:4:10,95
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING KOREAN]


99
0:4:10,95 --> 0:4:52,19



100
0:4:52,19 --> 0:4:54,3
SHANE SMITH: Now what he was
saying was a revelation.


101
0:4:54,3 --> 0:4:56,72
We had come all this way so we
could actually talk to North


102
0:4:56,72 --> 0:4:59,51
Koreans, and one of the first
ones we met was admitting that


103
0:4:59,51 --> 0:5:2,13
the standard of living was a
problem in the home country--


104
0:5:2,13 --> 0:5:4,86
which would never be admitted
to in North Korea proper.


105
0:5:4,86 --> 0:5:7,72
In fact, when the political
boss stepped in, he also


106
0:5:7,72 --> 0:5:9,47
admitted to living
a hard life.


107
0:5:9,47 --> 0:5:11,93
But of course, he blamed
it on America.


108
0:5:11,93 --> 0:5:13,18
MALE SPEAKER 3:
[SPEAKING KOREAN]


109
0:5:13,18 --> 0:5:41,666

0:5:45,92 --> 0:5:50,465
SHANE SMITH:
[TALK-SINGING IN KOREAN]


112
0:5:50,465 --> 0:5:52,25
OK.


113
0:5:52,25 --> 0:5:54,7
So they won't let us in.


114
0:5:54,7 --> 0:5:55,99
They don't want to get
in trouble, which is


115
0:5:55,99 --> 0:5:56,84
understandable.


116
0:5:56,84 --> 0:5:58,5
So they're kicking us out.


117
0:5:58,5 --> 0:6:1,27
We're going to try to go to the
forest to actually find


118
0:6:1,27 --> 0:6:3,18
some North Korean workers
who are actually


119
0:6:3,18 --> 0:6:4,43
cutting down the trees.


120
0:6:4,43 --> 0:6:14,2



121
0:6:14,2 --> 0:6:14,99
You want a beer?

Hello.
