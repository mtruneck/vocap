###4 MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon, folks.
###6 Welcome to today's "Authors at Talk."
###8 We have Huggy Rao and Bob Sutton with us, both from Stanford.
###13 And they are incredible collaborators
###15 who have written this new book called "Scaling Up Excellence,"
###18 which we will be discussing with them today.
###20 The format, as you can figure out,
###22 is a fireside chat between us.
###24 But we will open it up to you for questions at some point
###28 soon.
###29 Before I get into interactions with Huggy and Bob,
###35 my first exposure to Huggy was almost ten years back.
###37 And we were both working with an Indian nonprofit.
###41 And then a few years later, we again
###43 connected when I was at Google.
###44 And he is a frequent visitor to our annual PiLab summit, which
###48 is a gathering that we have every year, where
###53 we get academics from different social scientists
###55 to come out here.
###56 And Huggy always asked the most incisive questions out there.
###60 And he would say, can I be mischievous?
###62 And ask a critical question that would really make us think.
###67 And so today, I'm happy that I get
###69 to ask him the mischievous questions about his book.
###71 BOB SUTTON: He'll probably get you a couple times.
###75 MALE SPEAKER: And Bob is a professor
###77 at the Stanford engineering school.
###79 And Bob doesn't know this, but Jennifer Kurkoski,
###82 who leads our People & Innovation Lab,
###84 said that one of the best reads, that she has ever
###87 had on the academic side, is a paper
###90 that Bob authored in ASQ in '96.
###93 This was about brainstorming an idea--
###95 BOB SUTTON: Oh yeah, that was a long time ago--
###96 MALE SPEAKER: --and she said, that was the best research
###98 that she has ever read that describes
###100 a qualitative methodology.
###102 So we're really excited to have both of them out here.
###105 They have set up this program about scaling
###109 that they've been running at Stanford.
###111 And coming from both the business school side, as well
###114 as the engineering side, they really
###116 have a very Googley, I guess, approach
###119 to thinking about this huge problem with scaling.
###123 So let's give a warm welcome to Bob and Huggy.
###126 BOB SUTTON AND HUGGY RAO: Thank you very much.
###127 Thank you.
###127 
###129 MALE SPEAKER: So I have a few questions
###131 to start off the discussion.
###132 And then we'll get into some of your questions too.
###137 So the first one, I guess is, tell us
###139 what you mean by scaling?
###141 And why you thought it was important to write this book?
###144 BOB SUTTON: I guess, Huggy's looking at me,
###146 so that means I'm supposed to go first.
###148 So in the process of thinking about what this challenge was,
###152 it actually was a pretty simple problem
###155 that we thought was going to take
###156 a couple years to figure out.
###157 But some seven years later, we're still struggling with it.
###160 And it's essentially, when you've
###161 got a little bit of goodness in an organization,
###164 how do you spread it further?
###165 So it's everything from, you've got a startup,
###169 being Googley would be a good example like, how do you
###171 maintain your Googley-ness as you get bigger?
###174 And also, spreading goodness across the system,
###177 and getting rid of bad behavior.
###179 So one of the big things that led us to this research
###184 was, we were involved in the founding of the Stanford
###186 d.school, or Hasso Plattner Institute of Design.
###189 And spreading design thinking or innovation was a big challenge.
###193 And executives were always asking us, well, we've
###196 got this one group that's really great, how
###198 do we spread it further?
###199 So I guess the headline is, spreading something
###202 good from the few to the many.
###204 And it's a simple problem, but it's not easy to address.
###207 So that's the basic thing.
###209 HUGGY RAO: A very complementary addition
###212 to that would be that-- spreading good from one pocket
###216 to many pockets.
###218 You can think of that problem as a problem of diffusion,
###220 if you will.
###221 But there's also another dimension of scaling.
###223 And that is, if you're a small startup,
###225 as you grow rapidly and become larger in size,
###229 how do you actually scale successfully
###232 in the sense of not only achieving
###233 a particular footprint metric, but also making sure
###238 you retain your mindset.
###240 Let me illustrate that with a little example.
###243 One of the venture capitalists mentioned
###246 that the difference between a startup and a large company
###249 was, startups are like beach volleyball.
###253 You've got two people.
###254 You don't have substitutes.
###255 You don't have coaches.
###256 You know what the game plan is.
###258 You've got to make sure the ball doesn't touch the sand.
###260 You're playing volleyball still, you go from two to six.
###263 All of a sudden, if Prasad serves from the other end,
###268 I receive the serve.
###270 Bob takes it and supplies it to Cliff, here.
###273 Cliff arcs into the air and smashes the ball into the net.
###277 I'm sorry, Cliff.
###279 The interesting problem is, whose fault was it?
###281 Was it Prasad's serve that was unplayable?
###285 Was it my fault that I couldn't receive the serve well?
###288 Or was it the way Bob supplied?
###289 Or was it Cliff's problem?
###291 So you can see, when you go from two to six,
###294 how very quickly it becomes a problem.
###296 And you can extend it, six to 60,
###299 to 600, to 6,000, to 60,000, and the like.
###304 MALE SPEAKER: Great.
###305 Thank you for that introduction.
###306 So given that as the basis then, if you
###310 have to summarize, what is the advice that you would give
###313 organizations on how they should achieve scaling?
###316 And specifically, how would that differ for a startup,
###320 as you mentioned, versus, let's say a large organization
###324 like Google?
###326 HUGGY RAO: Let me take a quick stab at that.
###329 For a startup, I think the advice that both of us
###334 talk about in the book is, smart scaling
###338 means that you take time, and you do it slowly.
###341 We just recently had an organization
###345 that actually was acquired by Google, Waze.
###350 And we actually had one of their executives
###352 come and talk to our class, and he gave a great example.
###355 They were growing in Israel.
###356 You've got all these resources, and the VC is saying,
###360 now's the time to expand higher, higher, higher.
###363 The top managers get together and say, you know,
###367 now is the time to have a hiring freeze.
###369 And that's sort of somewhat counterintuitive.
###371 And people within the company are astonished, how could you
###374 say you have a hiring freeze right when you've
###376 got all this money from the VCs?
###378 And the argument was the following.
###382 The moment you expand, you actually
###384 are going to get a lot of smart people with very many ideas.
###388 And since you want to focus on a particular product application,
###391 you're going to wind up spending a lot of time
###394 saying no to their smart ideas.
###397 And that's not something you want to do.
###398 The other interesting thing was, when
###401 you hire people in a startup, the smart people
###404 assume they can hit the ground running.
###406 But often many of them can't.
###408 And very quickly you've shifted the ratio
###410 of unproductive to productive people, at least
###413 for a short window of time.
###415 And the third thing is, of course, you
###416 increase coordination costs enormously.
###419 So what they did was-- they did a smart thing--
###421 which is hiring freeze.
###424 But they made sure, during that period,
###427 every single employee was focused
###429 on one number-- improving their retention of users
###433 after three months.
###434 And pretty much every day, you have one question to ask.
###438 What did I do today to improve that number?
###441 So scaling smartly, very important
###443 for small organizations.
###445 I'll turn it over to you for the larger organizations--
###446 BOB SUTTON: --I get the large end?
###447 Well, I would also emphasize that there's
###449 a lot of things that are similar.
###452 And in particular, there's kind of two principles that
###455 are implied in what Huggy said.
###456 One is the notion that adding more people
###459 isn't necessarily good.
###460 This notion that many hands make light work.
###463 And we were actually talking about this at lunch.
###466 So in 2002, one of my other co-authors, Jeff Pfeffer and I
###469 interviewed Larry Page, when Google was about 400 people.
###472 And Larry emphasized how the venture capitalists
###475 were giving all this grief that he wasn't hiring fast enough.
###478 And that all of his friends from Stanford were giving him grief.
###480 But he said, we really have to slow down, and hire and get
###485 the right people who can grow with Google.
###487 And I'm not going to back off on that.
###490 And then, for the book, we interviewed Shona Brown,
###492 who was quite senior here for many years
###494 and helped grow sort of the non-product part
###496 of the organization, in particular.
###498 And Shona said, we constantly had this issue,
###502 where people are telling us to hire faster,
###503 but we had to make sure we got the right people in the seats.
###506 And I think that's a pretty good philosophy, , see,
###509 even the small versus a large company.
###512 But if I was going to talk about large companies,
###515 one of things that becomes increasingly important as they
###517 grow larger is-- and this is Huggy's expression--
###521 is the notion that bad is stronger than good.
###524 Or the path to greatness is to get rid of badness,
###527 so bad to great.
###528 And so what happens as companies get older,
###532 very often sort of bad behavior or ineffectiveness
###535 starts growing and growing.
###536 And if you just push the good, and you don't get rid
###540 of the bad, the bad gets obscured.
###541 And there's lots of evidence that, things
###543 like laziness, incompetence, all sorts of difficult things,
###547 just overwhelm the goodness.
###549 So good companies, and I'll sort of stop here,
###551 they view scaling as a problem of more or less.
###556 They're always adding more people,
###558 expanding the more places and so on.
###560 But in the process, they're getting rid
###562 of things that are getting in the way, are
###564 no longer effective.
###566 HUGGY RAO: If I could just add one more line to that.
###569 The big difference, I would say, between a small company scaling
###572 and a large company scaling is that, in a large company,
###575 I would hypothesize that the larger the company,
###579 the greater the probability that the smart people inside
###583 are going to become dumber.
###585 What I mean by that is, obviously I
###587 don't mean to insist--
###588 BOB SUTTON: Take that Google.
###589 [LAUGHTER]
###590 HUGGY RAO: --I don't mean to insist
###592 that smart people become stupid.
###594 Clearly that's an untenable position for me to argue.
###597 But what I would say is, that smart people can become dumb
###600 in the sense of being silent.
###603 And so in a large enterprise, I would
###605 submit that silence is the real enemy of excellence.
###609 BOB SUTTON: So just real quickly,
###610 I was at Pixar yesterday and met with some of the senior folks.
###614 And one thing that they did-- because Pixar
###617 is sort of at this point in transition
###619 where they've kind of grown up and everything-- and so
###621 Ed Catmull, who is president of Pixar,
###622 was worried that too many people were being silent.
###625 And the way Pixar actually does movies is that, four
###627 or five people who are the brain trust-- John Lasseter, Pete
###633 Docter, a number of other folks, who make comments on movies,
###636 and they write notes.
###637 But they had notes days where everybody
###639 wrote notes about everything that
###641 could be improved at Pixar.
###642 And it was because they were worried they had grown
###645 and the silence had sort of sunk in.
###647 And as they had gotten larger and older,
###649 there was too much of that.
###650 And that was a countervailing force.
###654 MALE SPEAKER: The technology industry
###655 has grown rapidly over the last few decades.
###660 And within that industry, there are many companies
###663 that have grown very, very quickly.
###666 And given your vantage and your knowledge
###669 of what's happening in that industry,
###671 do you see the processes and tools
###675 that technology companies use to scale?
###677 Are they different from what used
###679 to happen a generation ago?
###680 Or different from how it happens in the other industries?
###684 BOB SUTTON: What do you think, Huggy?
###686 HUGGY RAO: They are certainly very different.
###688 I mean, if you take Google, for example, and compare it to,
###692 let's say the median firm in Detroit.
###695 The way they scale is very, very different.
###697 Not just in terms of sheer pace, but also
###700 as you very rightly point out, the technology.
###703 One advantage is, you actually have technology
###706 that allows great decentralization.
###708 But conversely, technology also that
###710 allows great monitoring as well.
###713 So you actually have both dimensions of scaling.
###717 Whereas in the older industries, as it were,
###721 the problem is the costs of monitoring
###725 are very, very high because you really lack line of sight
###729 into the enterprise.
###730 Coincidentally, by the way, our operational definition
###733 of excellence, since both of us are social scientists,
###737 is not metric-related.
###739 But it simply means, excellence is
###742 when an organization-- when people in an organization--
###745 do the right thing, even when nobody's monitoring them.
###748 Even when nobody is actually watching over your shoulder.
###751 So I would say the older generation companies perhaps
###756 invest a little more in the monitoring part.
###758 Here, the kinds of individuals who
###760 self-select, they presumably disdain monitoring, in fact,
###765 otherwise they wouldn't actually join the organization.
###767 BOB SUTTON: One thing I would also
###769 add-- I tend to think of similarities more
###771 than differences-- maybe it's because I'm
###773 an old fashioned, qualitative researcher.
###777 But when I look even within tech firms,
###780 it's amazing how-- when organizations
###782 have a different mindset about how they're
###784 going to do things-- how it affects
###787 a whole bunch of different decisions about how people are
###790 hired, about how, actually, a who gets fired,
###793 the incentives, and so on, and the nature of their work.
###796 And one thing-- and I actually talked about this a little bit
###798 with your BizOps group about three or four months ago--
###801 when I think of-- and I already mentioned this a little bit--
###804 when I think of Google, I think of it
###805 as a place that has generally leaned towards generalists,
###808 and people can grow in the role.
###810 And at least, my conversations with Apple-- and I
###812 can't quote people because, of course,
###814 they'll shoot me, it being Apple.
###816 But my conversations with people at Apple
###818 is-- and I was told this story directly
###820 by a senior executive-- is people get more senior here,
###823 they get more specialized.
###826 And if you have an organization where
###827 you are assuming people are becoming
###829 more generalists versus more specialized,
###831 you have to run it in completely different ways.
###834 And I think that's an important difference between Google
###837 and Apple, and it doesn't work perfectly in all cases.
###839 You have certainly specialists here,
###841 and they have generalists there.
###842 But a sort of exhibit one-- and this
###844 is what this guy was talking about--
###845 was what was going to happen with Ron Johnson
###848 when he went to JC Penneys.
###849 So Ron Johnson was just extremely focused on,
###852 what's the experience like an Apple store?
###855 And the way it was described to me, him and Steve
###857 would argue for like an hour over exactly what angle
###860 an iPad should be in the store.
###862 And then you give a guy like that an entire business to run,
###865 the supply chain, pricing, you add everything.
###867 He would not be prepared as much to be a generalist.
###869 If you took another company like General Electric,
###871 it would be sort of the opposite sort of career path.
###874 So I do think that tech might have
###876 some of its own characteristics, but
###878 the company-to-company variation is just astounding.
###882 Even in the old days, I remember sitting
###884 in on new training for Facebook employees.
###887 So this was like-- and half of them
###889 were from Google, by the way.
###891 And I remember Chris Cox, who's now head of products,
###893 and then head of HR, saying, yes, you can go in tomorrow,
###896 and you can touch the code, and you can break it.
###898 And they'd say, we can't do that at Google.
###900 So the point is that, the different standards
###904 in companies are very important for scaling
###906 because-- as Huggy would say-- that in good organizations,
###909 people have a really clear view of what is sacred
###912 and what is taboo.
###913 And those vary from organizations to organizations.
###916 And when everybody agrees, it helps a lot.
###920 BOB SUTTON: As I was thinking about your question,
###922 what suddenly hit me also, was the sheer difference
###926 in the physical architecture between the tech companies
###931 and the old industrial giants.
###933 Open offices and all of these things.
###936 And I think part of what the tech companies do
###939 is they provide way more cues to individuals
###943 to excel than, I would submit, the large companies.
###947 Let me give you one research study which actually shows
###951 that when you have bright lights,
###953 people actually resort to much less cheating.
###955 Turn down the lamps, the propensity to cheat increases.
###959 So lamps matter more than cops, is one simple thing.
###964 And you can go to any organization
###966 and simply look at, how bright is the place?
###970 How dark is the place?
###971 That ought to give you at least an initial kind
###973 of working hypothesis about what's likely to happen.
###976 
###978 MALE SPEAKER: One of the scaling mantras
###980 that you have in the book.
###981 It is very colorful, it's called "Feel the Clusterfug"--
###986 BOB SUTTON: It's "fug" not "fuck."
###987 MALE SPEAKER: --and the last few letters
###989 are F-U-G, because we know this is going to be on YouTube.
###992 So tell us what you mean by that.
###995 BOB SUTTON: You're looking at me, why don't you go?
###997 HUGGY RAO: OK.
###998 Bob, of course, is well known to have a tendency
###1005 to really aim for very provocated titles.
###1009 His earlier books are inspired, let's say by various parts of--
###1014 BOB SUTTON: The "no asshole world,"
###1016 you can put that, if you want--
###1016 HUGGY RAO: Well, there you go.
###1018 So originally he was actually wanting to think of the book
###1023 as, maybe we ought to call it cluster,
###1026 and then you know what the expletive is.
###1028 The four letter word that follows cluster.
###1031 And as we were writing it, the editors of course
###1034 said, wait a minute you can't use something like that.
###1037 And fortunately, he quickly sort of thought
###1040 of Norman Mailer, who used the word "fug" to indicate the act.
###1045 And very quickly we thought of clusterfug.
###1048 So that's kind of the etymology of clusterfug.
###1050 Do you want to talk about--
###1052 BOB SUTTON: --so you get to do the fun part?
###1053 HUGGY RAO: --I get to do the fun part.
###1054 BOB SUTTON: So where this came from
###1054 is, we were having a dinner with a guy named Mark Hershon who
###1057 actually is a professional namer.
###1059 So he named the BlackBerry, he named Swiffer,
###1061 he's really a good namer, Dasani water.
###1064 And so we were trying to figure out
###1065 what the opposite of good scaling
###1067 was so we came on this word, clusterfug.
###1068 HUGGY RAO: After a lot of wine.
###1070 BOB SUTTON: After a lot of wine.
###1071 And we realize that there's sort of three characteristics you
###1075 would see, in particular, a bad IT Rollout at Stanford,
###1078 we were thinking of.
###1080 Or you can figure out what happened with Obamacare just
###1082 recently.
###1083 And when bad things happen, there's
###1084 three characteristics we always would see.
###1087 The first one would be illusion.
###1089 That this is going to be so easy, overconfidence, bias,
###1091 we can just roll it out.
###1093 So that's the first one.
###1094 The second was impatience, and this is classic with scaling,
###1097 we can do this really fast.
###1098 No problem.
###1099 And then the third one is, the people
###1102 doing it are incompetent.
###1103 And that makes others incompetent.
###1106 And to us, those three, illusion, impatience,
###1109 and incompetence, are the hallmarks of both the causes
###1113 and the characteristics of bad scaling.
###1115 And I think that that happened with Obamacare,
###1117 to name a company.
###1119 If you sort of dig in to what happened with poor Groupon.
###1123 I hope nobody here used to work at Groupon.
###1124 But if you read the CEO's resignation letter,
###1128 pretty much all three of those things were raging at Groupon.
###1133 And when I look at the companies in the Valley
###1136 that have generally got it right, they somehow or another
###1139 avoid that.
###1140 Especially the impatience part is sometimes the worst thing.
###1143 HUGGY RAO: So the implication behind all of this
###1145 is, really scaling up is easy, but screwing up
###1149 is equally easy.
###1150 And the problem of course is when people screw up,
###1154 we typically only focus on what's called, the sharp edge.
###1158 You look at a person or persons and promptly blame them.
###1162 But when you really understand what
###1163 causes them to make the mistake or the screw up,
###1166 you quickly realize there is actually
###1168 a confluence of a couple of things.
###1171 One is the psychology, the illusion part.
###1175 And the other is circulation, or physiology.
###1179 And this gets at the impatience part.
###1181 You hasten things, you do things, you block circulation.
###1184 And the third is anatomy, the structure in who
###1188 can occupy positions in the structure.
###1190 So all three of them kind of to come together.
###1193 And the result is, anything from Sochi, from one extreme,
###1197 to the doping scandal in biking.
###1199 So you can pick whatever you want in between,
###1201 you pretty much get an idea of how attempts to reform usually
###1207 wind up in clusterfugs.
###1210 MALE SPEAKER: Thank you for sharing that.
###1213 I have a bunch more questions, but if you have anything
###1215 please feel free to line up at the mic.
###1217 BOB SUTTON: We would love to hear some questions.
###1220 Torture us, we love that.
###1221 MALE SPEAKER: Yes, and while you're lining up,
###1223 let me just continue with a couple more.
###1226 And one of them is, the role of bureaucracy, right.
###1231 And so we often hear that organizations
###1235 grow by instilling a lot of bureaucracy.
###1237 But then that is not something that people
###1240 find very pleasant to bear with.
###1242 What is the role that you see for bureaucracy--
###1246 BOB SUTTON: --let me start out with that.
###1249 So bureaucracy seems to be used as a dirty word.
###1254 And to me there's a difference between having
###1256 just enough structure and just enough process,
###1258 versus having stuff that weighs people down.
###1261 And this is a big scaling issue which
###1262 is, when and how late you add process.
###1264 But just to go to what Huggy's little companies
###1267 that-- so there's a company called
###1268 Pulse started by two Stanford students, Ankit and Akshay.
###1272 So we went and we talked to them.
###1273 And they had about 11 or 12 people when we talked to them.
###1276 And they were describing how when
###1278 they got about seven people, they
###1280 realized that they have to break into a couple of teams, two
###1283 or three teams, because it was too big.
###1285 Teams over five or six usually are a nightmare,
###1287 especially when you get to 10.
###1288 And then when they got to 11, and that's
###1290 about the time where there are 11 or 12 people.
###1292 They're all in one room, sort of the street in Paulo Alto,
###1295 sort of the typical startup space with sort
###1297 of rough floors and everything.
###1298 But what they did is they had them working in three or four
###1300 different teams.
###1301 So they had division.
###1302 And then they each had a board that they
###1305 put with a Post-it note, what they were working on.
###1307 And then every afternoon, each team
###1309 would say, this is what we work-- they all turn around,
###1311 they would announce the other teams,
###1313 this is what we worked on.
###1314 Here's the challenges we need, can you help us?
###1317 And to me that's actually some bureaucracy.
###1319 It's some process.
###1320 It's some division.
###1323 But the challenge, and this is Chris Fry,
###1325 who is now head of Twitter, some engineering group,
###1329 and is going to bring me to a Commonwealth Club event
###1331 with him next week.
###1332 And Chris has this great line which
###1334 is that, the purpose of hierarchy
###1336 is to defeat bad bureaucracy, basically.
###1339 And I really like that line because some time stuff that's
###1342 put in causes all this friction, and that's bad bureaucracy.
###1345 But sometimes, I mean you've got to add a little bit complexity.
###1349 And the things he has, his test is, if what you put in
###1352 helps people get their work done,
###1354 but it doesn't feel like they're walking in muck,
###1356 then you're doing your job right.
###1357 And you've always got to be sensitive to that sort
###1360 of balance.
###1360 But bureaucracy has become, appropriately so,
###1363 a dirty word because of the way it's done so often.
###1365 But you do need hierarchy, you do need division of labor,
###1369 and you do need process.
###1371 Sorry, Google wouldn't work without all those things, as
###1375 warm and fuzzy a company as it is.
###1377 HUGGY RAO: My quick take on bureaucracy is the following.
###1380 I was actually reminded of the role of bureaucracy
###1383 when I was actually at a CTO forum a couple of days ago.
###1387 And one of the participants, they put it,
###1389 I thought, very cleverly.
###1391 He said, look, the great thing about brakes
###1395 is they also make you go faster.
###1396 BOB SUTTON: He means brakes on cars.
###1398 HUGGY RAO: Yeah.
###1399 Brakes on cars.
###1399 We often think of brakes, of course,
###1401 as something that limits speed.
###1403 But you could plausibly argue, when you have breaks you
###1405 actually go a little bit faster too.
###1407 And it's a little bit like that for rules.
###1410 And the real challenge about rules and bureaucracies
###1414 is whatever you do, you ought not to increase cognitive load.
###1419 And what we talk about in the book is, if you increase load,
###1423 you erode willpower.
###1424 And one of our colleagues did a beautiful experiment,
###1427 which actually was a variation on a theme.
###1430 So what he did was he took a large room
###1432 like this, randomly assigned you to two conditions.
###1435 One condition, you actually had to remember
###1437 a unique two-digit number.
###1439 The other condition, you had to remember
###1440 a unique seven-digit number.
###1442 And all that he does is, he opens the door there.
###1445 And along the corridors, there are
###1446 two tables, one laden with chocolate dessert, one laden
###1450 with fruits.
###1452 And lo and behold, what he finds is,
###1454 people who have been asked to remember the seven digit
###1456 number.
###1457 They're saying 238-9242 or whatever,
###1459 and the next thing you know is, you're really
###1461 kind of attacking the chocolate.
###1463 And the guys were told to remember the two digit number.
###1466 They can resist the temptation of chocolate,
###1468 and actually go eat the fruit.
###1471 And what we do in organizations when
###1473 we increase bureaucracy is, we're
###1475 actually increasing demands on people.
###1477 Everyone has to remember the seven digit number.
###1480 And then it's no use standing up and giving a speech and saying,
###1483 use your willpower.
###1484 They can't.
###1485 Because it's all depleted anyway, and that's the problem.
###1490 BOB SUTTON: We got a question.
###1491 ALL: All right.
###1492 All right.
###1492 Thank you.
###1493 
###1497 AUDIENCE: My question relates to,
###1499 one of things I'm hearing as you're talking,
###1501 is that people who, needing to scale up,
###1504 need to change the way in which they're doing things,
###1506 obviously.
###1507 One of things I'm thinking, if I play a role in Google, which
###1510 is designed to help people learn how to do that,
###1512 can you teach people to scale up?
###1514 And if so, what are some of the things
###1516 that are important to consider.
###1517 BOB SUTTON: So that's a great question.
###1519 And in the mindset that at least we try to instill, folks,
###1523 is constantly think, what got you here
###1526 that won't get you to the next stage?
###1528 And two diagnostic things I would start with, and then
###1533 Huggy maybe you can jump in, is to go back to this size thing.
###1537 Because there are things that work at one size
###1539 that won't work in another.
###1540 One of the classic ones, and one of the companies
###1542 we know very well, IDEO.
###1544 For years, when I was doing an ethnography there,
###1547 I would go to the Monday morning meeting.
###1549 There would be 60 people.
###1551 David Kelly, the CEO, would run it perfectly.
###1553 It got up to 150 even-- everybody would talk,
###1556 there would be this esprit de corps,
###1558 150 was just-- it was a clusterfug.
###1560 So they divided it up, and you sort of had to do it.
###1564 So that's one of the things.
###1565 And then the other test is that, back to this idea,
###1570 it feels like people are walking in muck.
###1571 And one tool we've been using-- in fact,
###1574 there's a Fortune 500 company that we just did this with,
###1576 where the CEO basically put $5,000 on the line
###1580 for each of the group presidents,
###1581 is we call the subtraction game.
###1583 And what we do is we have people think about what things
###1586 are getting in the way, and subtract stuff.
###1588 And it's amazing when you think about that.
###1591 Well if somebody came in your role,
###1592 which part would you take out?
###1594 That can be quite powerful.
###1597 You have some other ideas too, but I
###1600 do think it's a mindset of being aware of what is getting
###1602 in the way, in weighing us down.
###1605 HUGGY RAO: Just as a quick little extension.
###1607 Given your role for us, the key thing about scaling
###1611 is, scaling actually has inflection points.
###1616 So scaling is not arithmetic, you
###1618 have to really think calculus, if you will.
###1620 So as you move from one inflection point to another,
###1623 what worked if you scale, let's say from zero to 50
###1626 units may not work as you move from 50 to 100, then et cetera.
###1631 So the way we think about these challenges
###1634 is, you may start out as a Catholic,
###1637 and by which we mean you have a model
###1639 that you want to replicate.
###1641 But as you quickly go up in scale,
###1644 the option that you really want to think about
###1646 is, how can we actually become Buddhist?
###1649 By which we mean that instead of actually prescribing
###1654 every single thing you do, you outline general principles,
###1657 and you give tools to people.
###1660 So starting out Catholic becoming Buddhist
###1664 is certainly a useful thing.
###1666 Conversely, in large companies where
###1668 there's a lot of bad behavior, there's
###1670 a lot of Buddhism with respect to bad behavior too.
###1672 So there, one of the things you have to do
###1674 is, you have to be pretty Catholic about what
###1676 the bad behavior is.
###1678 Stop that one thing.
###1680 So those are the trade-offs that you
###1682 have to actually think of making.
###1685 BOB SUTTON: Good question.
###1688 AUDIENCE: Hi.
###1690 My question.
###1691 At Google, oftentimes we hear this principle,
###1693 and we act on them, and I know I've
###1695 done, is "launch and iterate."
###1697 Because we don't have time to scale slow,
###1701 that's the advice you said in the beginning.
###1703 Because there's all these demands that are coming to us
###1705 and we need to act extremely fast.
###1708 So how does your idea of scaling slowly,
###1714 would really work with this "launch and iterate" principle?
###1717 BOB SUTTON: To me, you sort of have
###1720 to decide which things you have to slow down at.
###1722 So you can do other things fast.
###1725 So I hate to bring up Facebook, but I will.
###1728 They put an enormous amount of energy
###1730 into hiring people and brainwashing them properly.
###1733 So they can move fast and break things.
###1735 So that's even more extreme than iteration.
###1737 And if you have the right people, and people
###1739 who will learn fast enough, and this,
###1741 we teach in the design school, both of us.
###1743 That's our whole philosophy is rapid
###1746 prototyping and moving fast.
###1749 And to me, the question is when you do that, do you create--
###1754 are you doing it in such a way where it's actually
###1756 safe to fail?
###1758 And if you're moving fast and breaking things
###1760 or doing rapid prototyping.
###1762 To me that's just fast learning.
###1764 And that should work.
###1765 But if you're doing that in a setting, where it's not
###1768 safe to fail, so surgery, launching an airplane,
###1773 keeping the Google site running, I
###1774 mean if people can't do a Google search,
###1776 really bad things are happening.
###1777 So I'm all for moving fast and breaking things
###1781 or rapid prototyping and the like.
###1783 But the more skilled people you've had,
###1785 so the more time you spent hiring them,
###1787 and the more they have actually shared ideas
###1789 of what effectiveness looks like and
###1791 doesn't, the faster you can move forward.
###1793 That's why Huggy's metric, Waze, is that the name that company?
###1798 That their metric was, are we acquiring customers or not?
###1801 So that's what success was.
###1802 So theirs is agreed upon.
###1803 But I'm not saying you should oh, be a nervous Cindy
###1806 and not move fast.
###1807 But there are times in life-- there's
###1809 a guy named Jerome Groopman, who writes stuff
###1811 on how doctors do diagnoses, and sometimes
###1814 in life, the best advice he says is, don't just do something,
###1819 stand there.
###1820 And a lot of the key to life-- and this is Danny Kahneman,
###1824 Nobel Prize-winning stuff too-- is figuring out
###1827 when you go to that sort of system
###1828 too where you actually have to do deep cognition versus boom,
###1831 we can go on automatic pilot.
###1833 So I don't think there's any hard, magic answers there.
###1836 But knowing when to hit the brakes,
###1837 so then you can accelerate later,
###1838 to use Huggy's metaphor is a lot of what scaling and all
###1841 of organizational life is about.
###1843 HUGGY RAO: Very quickly, if I can add--
###1845 BOB SUTTON: Good question.
###1846 HUGGY RAO: I think-- very nice question.
###1848 I'm often reminded of a lovely Latin proverb that
###1851 goes something like this, "Festina Lente," which
###1853 means "make haste slowly."
###1856 So here's the problem.
###1857 The problem is when decision makers want to scale,
###1861 they usually think of desirability considerations.
###1864 What's desirable?
###1866 And cognitively, when we think of what's desirable,
###1869 we actually think in very abstract ways.
###1872 We call that the air war in the book.
###1874 You sort of think it's an air-war problem.
###1876 All that you've got to do is you've
###1878 got to launch it all out.
###1879 You've got to do this, you've got to do that.
###1881 You think things are going to really scale.
###1883 But real scaling actually requires great attention
###1885 to concrete details, and to think feasibility.
###1889 So you really have to think about the ground war.
###1892 And in order to fight a ground war.
###1894 As you can imagine, a ground war also is intense, but arguably
###1898 that occurs on a somewhat slower time scale than just an air
###1903 war--
###1903 BOB SUTTON: And I would add, back to your prototyping idea.
###1906 So the great thing about prototyping
###1907 is, if you're good prototyper, whether it's
###1910 software or a product, it's really tangible.
###1913 You give people-- do you want the latch like this?
###1915 Do you want A or B, out of AB testing?
###1918 So the great thing about prototyping
###1919 is, you actually got tangibility.
###1921 You're not thinking abstractly.
###1923 That's like our definition of a lousy group of Stanford
###1927 students or executives, is they're
###1929 talking tangibly, and then my buddy Diego Rodriguez
###1933 from IDEO, when they talk like that, and he says,
###1935 where's your prototype?
###1936 And if they don't have a prototype, he says, F,
###1938 and he leaves.
###1939 So tangibility is a big part of that concreteness.
###1943 Please.
###1944 AUDIENCE: I have another question,
###1945 since nobody else is here.
###1947 BOB SUTTON: Oh good.
###1947 Yeah.
###1947 Go for it.
###1948 AUDIENCE: So you said that you define excellence very
###1951 generally, when people do the right thing when nobody's
###1954 watching, something like this.
###1956 I think at Google, we are very metrics-driven.
###1958 So we need to define excellence with metrics.
###1962 So what do you discuss about that in your book,
###1966 or you just keep it very general?
###1968 HUGGY RAO: I think what we talk about is,
###1970 when we think about excellence, we actually
###1972 are talking a lot about accountability.
###1975 Accountability actually has two dimensions.
###1978 One dimension is, you feel like you own the place.
###1982 But you can actually do things to influence development
###1986 metrics or whatsoever has been actually entrusted to you.
###1990 The second dimension really is, but you also
###1995 feel the place owns you.
###1997 So you need, I think, the push of commitment
###2000 and the tug of obligation.
###2002 And what's important with metrics is,
###2006 you want to make sure you preserve
###2007 that feeling of ownership, and you
###2009 create that sense of obligation.
###2011 If it's only metrics that you have-- you
###2015 can actually get to that footprint,
###2017 but lose the mindset.
###2019 A couple of weeks ago, there was this company
###2021 called Health Associates, which I
###2024 think is a Florida-based company that actually was indicted
###2027 by the attorney general's office.
###2029 Why were they indicted?
###2031 Because they were actually admitting people
###2032 into hospitals when there was absolutely no reason to do so.
###2036 And what was fascinating was the emphasis on metrics.
###2039 Every physician had a color-coded ID, if you will,
###2045 on a scorecard.
###2046 You beat target, you were green.
###2049 You were close to target, you were orange.
###2051 You were below target, you were red.
###2054 And what do you think these physicians did?
###2056 They were admitting young infants
###2057 with temperatures of 98.7, saying that they were abnormal.
###2062 Let them actually get admitted into the hospital,
###2064 because you're actually increasing revenue.
###2067 So there's also a dark side of accountability.
###2071 And the dark side of accountability
###2073 often is realized on the over-emphasis on metrics.
###2077 And we talked at length about that,
###2078 to be very mindful of that.
###2080 BOB SUTTON: But I'll get to what your saying,
###2081 but I want to-- and this is actually very good question--
###2084 I wouldn't necessarily directly disagree with Huggy, but--
###2087 HUGGY RAO: Please do.
###2088 BOB SUTTON: --but I agree that you have to-- that things
###2090 are more effective-- whatever the metrics are, when there's
###2093 that feeling that, I own the place, and the place owns me.
###2095 And you know what the larger thing
###2097 you're trying to accomplish is, assuming it's ethical.
###2099 Because this would work from unethical organizations too.
###2101 Let's have as many murders as we possibly can,
###2103 might be, for some organizations,
###2105 a reasonable metric.
###2106 But if you look at the cases that we look at.
###2108 And three points in my career, I try
###2111 to figure out what organizational effectiveness
###2113 was.
###2114 And each time I sort of succeeded and sort of failed.
###2117 And the best I could do was to say,
###2119 in every context you have to ask the question, effectiveness
###2122 of what?
###2123 And effectiveness for whom?
###2124 And come up with a reasonable metric in that situation.
###2128 So one of the cases we use in the book
###2130 is a group that does routine knee operations
###2134 at a hospital in Boston.
###2135 So for them, the contextualized metrics,
###2138 and you have them here at Google as well, would be,
###2142 so how much does it cost?
###2143 How much pain are they in?
###2144 And how many days are they in the hospital?
###2146 Those are pretty reasonable metrics,
###2148 assuming that they're dealing with the exceptions
###2150 in an ethical case, in an ethical way,
###2153 but I think the notion of metrics--
###2155 I don't think that Huggy and I would dismiss it.
###2157 And believe me, between the two of us,
###2159 he's the one who can count, not me.
###2161 He's one of the best people in metrics I've ever seen.
###2164 But embedding it in the context is very important.
###2167 Please.
###2168 AUDIENCE: And probably, also what you're saying
###2170 is too many metrics could be the dark side,
###2173 but just enough, that's what you should go for.
###2176 BOB SUTTON: So one of my favorite examples,
###2177 I can't remember if we put this in a book or not,
###2179 but Jeff Pfeffer and I, once, years ago, we
###2182 were studying Citibank.
###2183 And we were introduced to the most effective Citibank branch
###2187 manager in all of the New York metropolitan area.
###2189 So we go in, and they got this balance scorecard,
###2191 they got like 30 measures.
###2193 We say, what's the secret to your success?
###2194 He said, I ignore everything on the scorecard.
###2196 And the reason they think I'm the best person
###2198 is that I have the best profitability of any branch.
###2202 And you notice that they called me the best guy,
###2204 and that balance scorecard is bullshit.
###2206 And the other people who are screwing up
###2207 are actually paying attention to it.
###2209 So absolutely too many metrics are very bad.
###2215 I like Huggy's case with Waze.
###2217 AUDIENCE: Actually I would also add that the right metrics are
###2219 just as important, right?
###2221 Metrics drive behavior.
###2223 I think, the question that I have on the table is,
###2226 when we talk about scaling, I think
###2229 you touch upon people, process, tools, so all those three
###2234 things we need to look at them, right?
###2236 And how to prioritize.
###2237 And I think you talk about stopping bad behavior.
###2241 And I find that really interesting,
###2243 and I kind of want to hear your take on,
###2245 what are some of the things that the highly successful companies
###2250 do in dealing with the people issue?
###2253 Because you do hire different people
###2256 with different capabilities as the company grows.
###2260 Because the needs change.
###2261 So but you go enter with different players on the field.
###2265 How do you make them work together, right?
###2268 HUGGY RAO: Yeah.
###2268 That's a great question as well.
###2270 So the first thing about bad behavior.
###2273 The very basic finding, robust finding,
###2275 is bad's way stronger than good.
###2278 In one study of marital relationships, what is it?
###2282 For every nasty thing you tell your partner, or spouse,
###2285 you have to say five good things at least--
###2287 BOB SUTTON: Or it's not going to last.
###2289 HUGGY RAO: --and you can imagine the, sort of, asymmetry.
###2292 The thing about bad behavior is, bad behavior basically
###2296 is a signal that nobody cares.
###2299 And that's the reason why you have
###2301 to actually get to it very quickly.
###2304 And it might actually have to do with waste,
###2309 it might have to do with delay, it
###2311 might have to do with outright malfeasance, whatever
###2314 the manifestation of bad behavior is.
###2318 But the important thing to realize,
###2319 and we talk about in the book is,
###2321 you don't want to leap to the conclusion
###2323 that bad behavior is the product of bad people.
###2326 Good people do bad things.
###2329 Because they're mostly responding to the system
###2332 that's there.
###2333 And you guys at Google do a marvelous job of making sure--
###2337 when you think of people who aren't performing,
###2341 how you actually reduce variance in performance,
###2344 by giving them a new start and so forth.
###2346 So very important to make sure you come to terms with the fact
###2351 that why are bad people-- why are good people doing
###2354 bad things?
###2355 And here, context matters.
###2357 At the other extreme, what we talk about in the book is,
###2360 people do bad things because bad involves thrill.
###2363 And one of the things you've got to you've
###2365 got to kill the thrill.
###2367 We actually have an example of a nice study done by psychologist
###2371 about a factory where they were actually stealing tools.
###2377 So what do you do?
###2378 BOB SUTTON: Like big tools, like things
###2379 that weighed 1,000 pounds.
###2381 HUGGY RAO: They're all taking them home.
###2382 So you can think of, oh my god, I'm going to put fines.
###2386 No, I'm going to appoint guards.
###2388 No, we're going to have video cameras.
###2390 So these guys thought about it, and they came back
###2392 with a very strikingly counter intuitive solution.
###2396 They said, hey, we actually have a lending library here.
###2399 You guys can borrow the tools, and if you've been late,
###2403 there's an amnesty, you can always turn it back in.
###2407 So once there was no prohibition about taking the tools,
###2410 the thrill of stealing was kind of
###2411 lost because anybody could take any tool.
###2414 And of course, these workers were
###2416 being pressured by their wives saying,
###2418 you're messing up the art and taking up too much space.
###2421 Please return those damn tools back to your factory.
###2425 So they were able to stop it like that.
###2427 So those are the two bookends, if you will of that.
###2430 BOB SUTTON: In this story, I like to use the metric.
###2432 They went from having a million dollars worth of stuff a year
###2435 stolen to nothing, just by saying, here it's yours.
###2437 This was a great example of killing the thrill.
###2439 And they would just steal things that
###2440 were hard to steal, just because it was fun to steal them,
###2443 not because they needed them.
###2445 HUGGY RAO: The other thing you have to keep in mind
###2448 is-- and I just want to connect the metrics
###2452 and kind of bad behavior-- this isn't
###2455 a conclusion by any means, but at least a good null
###2457 hypothesis.
###2459 When there are lots of metrics, a good null
###2461 hypothesis to begin is, you have smart people who are afraid.
###2466 Because if all of the metrics were highly correlated,
###2469 they would all load into one factor.
###2471 So obviously you don't need 30 metrics
###2473 because the intercorrelations are so high.
###2475 And the reason they're not going to be correlated
###2477 is you going to look good on some things.
###2479 BOB SUTTON: I would also add, independently,
###2480 the fear-- I actually did some early consulting
###2483 work a litttle with HP on this when they had too many metrics.
###2485 And what ends up happening is, in terms of having
###2489 the same mindset and people in the same page is,
###2492 the whole game becomes-- so you're a general manager at HP.
###2495 In the old days, there's 54 divisions
###2497 and you're assessed on like 30 or 40 different metrics.
###2500 Your job is to convince everybody
###2502 that the one metric you're great on
###2503 is what you should be evaluated on.
###2505 So this whole political gamesmanship
###2507 went on that had nothing to do with actually
###2510 moving the company forward.
###2511 Yes.
###2512 You have a question here.
###2514 AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming here, and writing the book.
###2516 BOB SUTTON: Thank you.
###2517 AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask about the step
###2519 before you worry about scaling.
###2520 There is a lot of theories, and Paul Graham
###2524 I think wrote an article a few months back that,
###2526 startups should never worry about scaling,
###2528 should just get the prototype, learn as much as you can.
###2531 And I've actually managed startups
###2534 where we had a great product.
###2538 We had the team of people that were not aligned.
###2540 And we had the three issues that you mentioned,
###2542 incompetence, the impatience, and the illusion.
###2547 And I sort of said, OK.
###2549 Let's stop.
###2550 And let's try to figure out what's going on.
###2553 And improve it based on that.
###2555 And then worry about scaling.
###2556 It's not about getting more customers, et cetera.
###2558 BOB SUTTON: I think you answered your own question brilliantly.
###2561 And the way that we say this, and it's
###2563 one of those things that is so obvious, it's stupid.
###2565 But companies sometimes forget it.
###2568 Which is to spread excellence, you
###2570 have to have excellence to spread.
###2572 And so you've got to stop-- and that's
###2574 why to quote Huggy-- it's a ground war,
###2578 it's not an air war.
###2578 When you have real excellence, you actually
###2580 create that little pocket in them.
###2582 And especially if you have money.
###2583 Money's dangerous.
###2585 And I think you're Waze example is great
###2586 because it's a temptation.
###2587 Let's build it out and hire a huge sales organization
###2590 before we have something that we're selling
###2591 is a classic thing that's happening
###2592 in many of our over funded startups in the Valley right
###2595 now.
###2595 And that's one advantage that Larry and Sergey took
###2597 a long time for them to sell Google,
###2599 so they actually had to work on making the thing even better.
###2602 And just to give you an example, in the IT rollout space.
###2606 One of my favorite cases in the book,
###2608 at the end of chapter two, is a great rollout
###2611 of medical care, electronic medical care
###2616 records at Kaiser Permanente.
###2617 And the way they did it, this woman named Louise Lang led it.
###2620 It was about six or seven year process, cost about $5 billion.
###2624 Kaiser's the biggest health care system
###2626 in the country, private health care system.
###2628 They got it working perfectly in the smallest region in Hawaii.
###2631 They got it just, worked and worked and worked.
###2633 And once that started working, then
###2635 they went to the next region, once it was working,
###2637 went to the next one.
###2638 So they didn't spread that thin coat of whatever.
###2640 They got it humming, and then they spread that excellence.
###2643 So your example in the startup, I think, is exactly right.
###2646 And that's one reason that-- probably most people know
###2649 this evidence-- there's a lot of evidence of startups that
###2651 are started in downturns are more likely to survive and grow
###2657 into larger companies than upturns because they-- well
###2659 first of all, don't have too much money, and second of all,
###2662 they have to take time to do stuff right.
###2664 And I remember when we interviewed Larry Page in 2002,
###2667 I could not figure out whether he was the last dot.com person
###2671 standing, or actually, he was on to something.
###2673 Because all the other companies seemed to be dead.
###2676 And then there was this guy, Larry Page,
###2678 who claimed that he was going to grow a huge company.
###2680 And I guess he was right.
###2682 So I think you've got it, man.
###2685 AUDIENCE: So I guess the core of my question,
###2686 and based on your experience, and maybe it
###2688 might be your next book which is, how do you
###2691 infuse excellence in the first place?
###2693 BOB SUTTON: OK.
###2694 Huggy you answer that.
###2694 That's too hard.
###2695 Huggy gets all the hard questions.
###2697 He's the smart one--
###2698 HUGGY RAO: I think--
###2698 BOB SUTTON: --He is.
###2699 If there was an IQ test right now, [INAUDIBLE] happen.
###2702 HUGGY RAO: So this actually dovetails
###2705 quite nicely with one of the core beliefs at Google
###2708 and really your own experience here.
###2711 I think the heart of infusing excellence
###2714 is really how you hire people.
###2717 That's one part.
###2720 And real excellence also means, how do you
###2723 get extraordinary performance out of ordinary individuals?
###2727 So hiring talent doesn't sort of mean,
###2729 well we're actually going to get the very best people.
###2733 And we're going to pay a whole lot and so forth.
###2735 You can actually get amazing performance
###2737 from ordinary individuals.
###2739 And here, changing the context matters.
###2743 One of the cases that we talk about,
###2744 which was actually written by a colleague of ours at Stanford,
###2748 is about a company called Tomago-ya in Japan.
###2751 And what Tomago-ya does is they deliver lunch to offices,
###2756 $3.60 per lunch.
###2759 And it's a little Bento box.
###2762 So every day you can order the lunch you want.
###2764 The last order is at 10 o'clock.
###2767 And you've got to deliver the lunch by 12.
###2769 The amazing thing is, their factory is more than 2.5 hours
###2772 away from the business district of Tokyo, Shinjuku,
###2775 but you've got to deliver the lunch.
###2777 So the problem is, how do you actually wait until 10 o'clock
###2780 and deliver the lunch?
###2782 And every day they serve 70,000 lunches.
###2786 And the average waste, if you will,
###2790 the underage, or in their case, the overage,
###2793 is that on 46 lunches, which translates to 0.06.
###2798 My colleague, who wrote the case, asked the CEO.
###2801 He says, how do you do that?
###2802 Do you guys have very sophisticated algorithms,
###2804 where you can process orders, route trucks.
###2807 He says no.
###2809 How do you do that?
###2810 And he says, well, we make sure our trucks leave
###2813 before the first order comes.
###2815 And the guy says, how can you do that?
###2817 How can you get trucks to leave your facility at 8:00
###2820 in the morning to the farthest the [INAUDIBLE] customers
###2824 even before you got the orders?
###2826 And the guy says, the key people are our van drivers,
###2830 who deliver the lunches.
###2831 They can actually pick the customer.
###2833 And once the lunch is over, these are reusable Bento boxes.
###2837 You can go and pick the Bento box up, talk to people,
###2840 and quickly find out what the nature of demand the next day
###2843 is.
###2844 And in the evening, they tell their boss.
###2846 By the way, a small district actually
###2849 is managed by one of these area managers.
###2852 And then you'll funnel it upwards,
###2854 and that's really what it is.
###2856 And my colleague said, now, who designed this?
###2859 And the founder said, you know, me and the truck drivers.
###2862 And he said, who are the truck drivers?
###2864 And this is the striking part, they
###2866 are all people who are high school dropouts.
###2870 Now, it's true that there are bonuses
###2871 that link to any weigh stage.
###2873 But the point is, it's not just that.
###2876 You've given them a second chance.
###2878 And you are really getting extraordinary performance
###2881 out of people who could arguably be labeled C or B, or whatever.
###2885 So very important to keep that in mind.
###2889 AUDIENCE: I'll make it a little bit harder.
###2891 So you go into a startup, small team, one star.
###2897 
###2900 Most of the others are B's and a few, let's call, F's.
###2904 And you start getting rid of the F's because it's just not
###2908 working.
###2909 And then you end up with a smaller team,
###2911 with the VCs shouting at you.
###2912 And you're running out of money, product's not performing.
###2916 The excellence, the culture of the company is just struggling.
###2921 And all of the elements are against you,
###2926 as any other startup.
###2928 And then to infuse a culture of excellence
###2930 into a place that got used to being sub-mediocre performance
###2935 is something I really struggled with personally
###2938 in a previous life.
###2939 And I want to just see what is your take on how
###2943 that could that be handled.
###2945 HUGGY RAO: I can certainly feel your pain is
###2947 one thing I can say.
###2948 I'm being mischievous here.
###2950 But in the hypothetical example, or the reconstructed example
###2954 out of your experience that you gave, you've got one star,
###2957 you've taken out the F's, I assume.
###2961 And you've got the B people as it were, so to speak.
###2965 And one of the things we talk about
###2966 is, scaling isn't just about stars, it's actually
###2971 about your sherpas, too.
###2973 I mean think of how you get to the top of Everest.
###2975 Three people get there, that's true.
###2977 But there's a lot of people who actually
###2979 do all the heavy lifting to help you get there.
###2980 BOB SUTTON: The Sherpas are the stars,
###2981 and the other people just pay them money.
###2983 So [INAUDIBLE] the question where the stars is.
###2986 HUGGY RAO: So the real challenge is, how do you actually
###2989 get great performance out of people who are at the B level?
###2993 And one simple place to start.
###2995 It's by no means a sure fire bullet is,
###2999 if you look at the evidence, B-level players respond
###3003 way more positively to gifts that are actually
###3009 given to them.
###3011 So when I say gifts, I'm not saying buying them off
###3013 with money, doing something for them that's a surprise
###3016 that they actually value.
###3019 And the reason is, if you have B-level player,
###3021 you look around in the market, and you sort of say,
###3024 I'm looking around, I can't get a job
###3026 like I have in this company.
###3028 Here's a company that's done something nice for me.
###3031 And it could be as simple a thing as something
###3033 for their child or spouse or whatever
###3036 the specific instantiation is, they're
###3038 actually going to give you 10x back.
###3041 If I'm an A-level player, you do something nice for me,
###3045 I'm also going to scan the talent market,
###3047 and simply say, well he did it because hey,
###3049 that's the price at attention.
###3051 Otherwise, I'm going to go someplace else.
###3053 So you actually have very asymmetric responses
###3056 to gift-giving.
###3058 And what you really need to understand
###3060 is, what's the gift that makes the most
###3062 sense for your B-level players?
###3065 And that, I don't have line of sight to give you more--
###3067 BOB SUTTON: I'm going to say something more cynical which
###3070 is, we hear about the-- including this one we're
###3073 sitting in now-- the startups that all make it.
###3076 Most of them die.
###3077 Most of them deserve to die.
###3078 And a lot of the entrepreneurial game, I'm sorry,
###3081 it's just knowing when to shoot the thing.
###3083 And venture capitalists, especially the good ones,
###3086 are really good at that.
###3088 And I don't want to damn your startup.
###3091 But the typical startup in Silicon Valley dies.
###3095 And it should die.
###3096 So in the thing to do is to take that A-player
###3099 and maybe reform with another set A-players and to go again.
###3103 Because the great thing about startups is, failure's cheap.
###3106 And most of you who start firms in Silicon Valley-- this
###3110 is not Detroit-- you can get another job.
###3112 Most of you are quite talented.
###3113 So my view of startups is, if things are really screwed up,
###3116 well that's what pulling the plug is for.
###3119 And quitting is good.
###3121 Never quit-- that's bullshit.
###3123 HUGGY RAO: And certainly, you don't
###3126 want to escalate commitment to a losing course of action either.
###3129 BOB SUTTON: That's what I was saying.
###3132 More fancy language.
###3134 HUGGY RAO: This is the conversation Bob and I have.
###3136 But usually over a lot of wine so.
###3138 MALE SPEAKER: So having said all that, you aren't advising
###3141 people to go to startups, right?
###3142 [LAUGHTER]
###3143 BOB SUTTON: No, no.
###3146 You all know the odds.
###3147 You all know the game.
###3148 So it's just the way it works.
###3149 So you go there, and Google buys you or they come back,
###3152 you come back as an employee after it died.
###3154 Either way, it's OK.
###3155 MALE SPEAKER: So do we have time for a question or two, Cliff,
###3158 or are we set?
###3159 CLIFF: Yes, a final question.
###3160 MALE SPEAKER: Any other audience question for Bob and Huggy?
###3163 
###3167 I had one more, which doesn't have anything
###3169 to do with the book itself.
###3171 Obviously, both of you teach at the business school
###3173 at Standford.
###3175 And many Googlers are interested in going
###3177 to business school getting their MBAs, right?
###3180 So what's the advice that you'd give to a Googler who's
###3186 considering business school, who has
###3188 other things that they could do?
###3190 And this is a question that we and the people up scheme
###3193 get asked all the time.
###3195 So since we have you, we can ask the same question of you.
###3198 And by the way, don't make it too compelling
###3200 because we want these people to stay here.
###3202 HUGGY RAO: So Bob why don't you actually be--
###3205 BOB SUTTON: I don't teach in a business school, remember.
###3207 I'm an engineering professor, so therefore, I
###3209 am free to be cynical.
###3211 Our friend Jeff Pfeffer would tell you
###3213 that, if you're interested actually in lifetime income,
###3217 that you should only go to a top eight-- in addition to the fact
###3220 that it's a great vacation, and all sorts of wonderful things
###3222 happen in business school.
###3224 But you should only go to a top eight or ten business school.
###3228 Because other than that it's just
###3229 going to take two years of your life
###3230 and lower your lifetime income, and there's very good evidence
###3232 to support this.
###3233 So I want to play the, sort of, Jeff Pfeffer card.
###3237 But one thing I will say about the Stanford Business
###3239 School, where I don't teach, because I'm
###3242 a tenured engineering professor, is that-- as my understanding--
###3246 is that if you go to Stanford, it's
###3247 actually a really good financial deal.
###3249 That on average, you're going to come out ahead financially.
###3252 And culturally, that's sort of up to you.
###3254 The final thing I would say though, since I'm
###3256 from an engineering school and I'm not engineer,
###3258 is we all know that the characteristic
###3260 of the current boom is it's much, much less
###3263 MBA-centric, and much, much-- you
###3267 know this much better than I do--
###3268 and much, much more engineering-centric.
###3271 So it's the engineers' days, and we're
###3273 winning, even on an engineer.
###3275 HUGGY RAO: So one other thing to keep in mind
###3277 is, business schools are changing dramatically too,
###3283 so you don't think of the MBA as a standalone degree.
###3286 In fact, we have a number of programs where you actually
###3288 have an MBA, you can also get a masters
###3291 in computer science and electrical engineering,
###3293 just to name a few.
###3296 So there are lots of options and combinations.
###3299 Our experience certainly at the Stanford Business School
###3302 is, pretty much, the kinds of people who actually come,
###3306 they're overwhelmingly tilted towards a startup option.
###3310 By the end of year one, they've already figured out an idea.
###3314 They're working.
###3315 They're trying to do things.
###3317 And as a matter of fact, right before I came here,
###3319 I was actually teaching a course along with a finance professor
###3323 and a marketing professor, a course called "From Launch
###3326 to Liquidity."
###3328 Once you start a venture, how do you actually
###3330 think of your exit?
###3331 And I can certainly tell you, our students
###3334 believe in very liquid futures.
###3336 or at least, they kind of anticipate that.
###3338 BOB SUTTON: See, I don't even know
###3339 how he was teaching this, since I'm very focused.
###3341 The course we teach in the engineering school, especially
###3343 the design school, we wouldn't talk about it.
###3345 We have a class called "Launch Pad."
###3347 We put you in it, and you'd start your company.
###3349 And so there's a class called "Launch Pad"
###3351 taught by Michael Dearing and Perry
###3352 Klebahn, both who are successful entrepreneurs
###3354 in their own right.
###3355 Although Michael did fail in a big shoe operation.
###3358 If you don't have a product by week four,
###3359 you're supposed to be thrown out.
###3361 So little--
###3362 HUGGY RAO: A number of our students
###3363 actually do take that course--
###3365 BOB SUTTON: You can take that as well in the business school.
###3366 HUGGY RAO: So you have the whole, sort of, university.
###3369 But just to give underscore.
###3371 Bob's point about how attractive this is as an option.
###3375 Once when I was teaching a class,
###3377 there was a young lady who got up and told everybody
###3381 in the class, hey, I have a proposal for you.
###3383 And she looked at me and said, professor,
###3384 can I make the proposal?
###3386 I said, sure.
###3386 She looked at 80 kids in the class and said,
###3389 I'm actually going to give you $250,000 right now.
###3393 In return, I want 2% of your lifetime earnings.
###3398 what do you think was the response of those 80 people?
###3402 Mull over that, and that's where we
###3404 ought to appropriately close on a puzzle.
###3407 BOB SUTTON: That's like a Google interview
###3409 question, the old ones.
###3411 MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.
###3412 Thank you Bob and Huggy for coming over and sharing
###3414 all of your insights on scaling.
###3416 Again, the book is called "Scaling Up Excellence."
###3418 BOB SUTTON: Thanks for your questions.
###3420 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, thank you for questions,
###3421 and we have copies of the book in the back, as well.
###3424 So, with that, lets give a warm round to Bob and Huggy.
###3427 BOB SUTTON: Thank you.
###3428 HUGGY RAO: Thank you very much.
###3429 [MUSIC PLAYING]
