###31 TERI DIMARINO: The competition can involve everything from
###33 the sublime to the ridiculous.
###35 And it's fun.
###36 It is still a grooming competition.
###38 This is what people forget.
###39 It's not just a dog-decorating competition.
###41 There are criteria based on the coloring of
###44 the dog, its grooming.
###45 There's technical aspects of it.
###47 How is the scissoring, the clipper work?
###49 Is it clean?
###50 Here there's no holds barred.
###52 Everything is pretty much legal with the designs, the
###56 creativity, and our presentations.
###58 It's a package.

###65 ADRIENNE POPE: Well first of all, you walk out
###66 with a dog like that.
###67 When I go to a gas station on the way here,
###69 people bombard me.
###70 I mean, they're just like, oh my gosh!
###72 Was he born like that?
###73 I mean, I've gotten so many questions.
###75 
###77 KAT OBSON: My dog's name is Koby, and he is a puppy.
###80 And he is designed in a Jurassic-Park theme.
###83 And the poodles have such great hair for it because it
###85 just sticks straight out.
###86 So it's really easy to sculpt.
###88 And I enjoy it.
###90 It's fun.
###91 It's good time to spend with your dog, good
###93 time to spend bonding.
###95 And he gets all this attention after he's done.
###98 
###110 TERI DIMARINO: OK.
###111 Our winner of the Groom Expo 2011 People's Choice Award is
