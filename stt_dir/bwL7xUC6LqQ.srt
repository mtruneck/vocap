0:0:36,434 --> 0:0:38,47
GRACE HONIGSBERG: Hello,
I'm Grace.


3
0:0:38,47 --> 0:0:43,855
I live here at Hidden Pastures
Alpaca farm with 65 alpacas in


4
0:0:43,855 --> 0:0:45,5
the back yard.


5
0:0:45,5 --> 0:0:47,9
PAUL HONIGSBERG: Hi, my name
is Paul Honigsberg.


6
0:0:47,9 --> 0:0:49,628
I live here at Hidden
Pastures.


7
0:0:49,628 --> 0:0:52,263
I like these alpacas a lot.


8
0:0:52,263 --> 0:0:56,43
ANTHONY: Hi, I'm Anthony,
and I'm Paul's friend.


9
0:0:56,43 --> 0:1:0,26
I'm nine years old, and
I come here a lot.


10
0:1:0,26 --> 0:1:3,23
I know a lot about
alpacas too.


11
0:1:3,23 --> 0:1:5,22
KAYLE DEFRANK: Hi, I'm
Kayla DeFrank.


12
0:1:5,22 --> 0:1:6,43
I come here a lot.


13
0:1:6,43 --> 0:1:10,5
I basically know my way around
here blindfolded.


14
0:1:10,5 --> 0:1:13,22



15
0:1:13,22 --> 0:1:14,1
GRACE HONIGSBERG: This
is something


16
0:1:14,1 --> 0:1:16,32
called fiber on them.


17
0:1:16,32 --> 0:1:20,53
And if you see the inside
of it, it's very crimpy.


18
0:1:20,53 --> 0:1:23,4
That's ideal in an alpaca.


19
0:1:23,4 --> 0:1:25,43
NATALIE BURGER: These alpacas
were shorn in April, so they


20
0:1:25,43 --> 0:1:28,37
probably only have about an
inch of fleece right now.


21
0:1:28,37 --> 0:1:31,73
At full fleece, they'll have
four to six inches of fleece,


22
0:1:31,73 --> 0:1:35,17
and they'll be shearing
5 to 15 pounds of


23
0:1:35,17 --> 0:1:37,54
fleece off their bodies.


24
0:1:37,54 --> 0:1:42,77
I love to send my fleece to a
mill to make it into yarn, and


25
0:1:42,77 --> 0:1:45,86
then I sell yarn at the various
yarn shops in the


26
0:1:45,86 --> 0:1:48,86
area, as well as we go to
different farmers markets with


27
0:1:48,86 --> 0:1:52,485
an alpaca just to let people
know what an alpaca is and


28
0:1:52,485 --> 0:1:54,94
what a wonderful product
they do create.


29
0:1:54,94 --> 0:1:57,69
KAYLE DEFRANK: Alpaca socks in
the winter are extremely warm.


30
0:1:57,69 --> 0:2:0,73
I usually sleep with them
because they just keep my body


31
0:2:0,73 --> 0:2:3,97
heated instead of, I'm
cold, I'm cold.


32
0:2:3,97 --> 0:2:5,911



33
0:2:5,911 --> 0:2:7,7
-Who's this little guy?


34
0:2:7,7 --> 0:2:9,99
GRACE HONIGSBERG: This is a
girl, her name is Jewel.


35
0:2:9,99 --> 0:2:13,902
She's about six months,
half a year old.


36
0:2:13,902 --> 0:2:15,43
KAYLE DEFRANK: This
is Neptune's baby.


37
0:2:15,43 --> 0:2:19,14
There's her mom, Neptune.


38
0:2:19,14 --> 0:2:21,83
This baby has blue eyes,
which means she's


39
0:2:21,83 --> 0:2:23,385
deaf and can't hear.


40
0:2:23,385 --> 0:2:26,1
She's very adorable and fuzzy.


41
0:2:26,1 --> 0:2:27,26
-And how old is she?


42
0:2:27,26 --> 0:2:28,485
KAYLE DEFRANK: Four days old.


43
0:2:28,485 --> 0:2:29,63
-Four days.


44
0:2:29,63 --> 0:2:30,63
GRACE HONIGSBERG: This
one's Terror.


45
0:2:30,63 --> 0:2:37,89
He's the terror of the group,
but he bothers everyone else


46
0:2:37,89 --> 0:2:41,7
in the herd.


47
0:2:41,7 --> 0:2:44,19
He doesn't have a name yet,
but he's very cute.


48
0:2:44,19 --> 0:2:47,29
They make a humming noise,
which is what Charisma is


49
0:2:47,29 --> 0:2:49,23
making to her baby.


50
0:2:49,23 --> 0:2:53,75
They also make a clicking noise,
that distinct click.


51
0:2:53,75 --> 0:2:58,12
KAYLE DEFRANK: And when the
male is breeding with the


52
0:2:58,12 --> 0:3:1,17
female, he "orkles"?


53
0:3:1,17 --> 0:3:2,2
GRACE HONIGSBERG: Orgles.


54
0:3:2,2 --> 0:3:4,25
KAYLE DEFRANK: Orgles.


55
0:3:4,25 --> 0:3:6,0
-What does that sound like?


56
0:3:6,0 --> 0:3:7,288
KAYLE DEFRANK: You can't
make the noise.


57
0:3:7,288 --> 0:3:22,28
[ORGLING]


58
0:3:22,28 --> 0:3:24,48
GRACE HONIGSBERG: This
is baby Cassia.


59
0:3:24,48 --> 0:3:29,91
She's got very exotic
marks on her head.


60
0:3:29,91 --> 0:3:33,21
They come in 22 natural
colors.


61
0:3:33,21 --> 0:3:36,252
They are very sweet animals.


62
0:3:36,252 --> 0:3:37,77
They're just around you.


63
0:3:37,77 --> 0:3:41,71
They're not trying to
hurt me in any way.


64
0:3:41,71 --> 0:3:45,7
KAYLE DEFRANK: They're not
trying to run away from us


65
0:3:45,7 --> 0:3:46,94
because they think
we're a threat.


66
0:3:46,94 --> 0:3:49,89
They're just being peaceful.


67
0:3:49,89 --> 0:3:52,11
GRACE HONIGSBERG: Yes, they're
very peaceful animals.


68
0:3:52,11 --> 0:3:53,26
-And they can't bite you?


69
0:3:53,26 --> 0:3:54,1
GRACE HONIGSBERG: They cannot.


70
0:3:54,1 --> 0:3:56,35
TOGETHER: They only
have bottom teeth.
