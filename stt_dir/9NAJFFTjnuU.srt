the Boneless


6
0:0:14,17 --> 0:0:16,2
was invented at Dio's.

It's down the street
from the block.

across the street, Ohio style.

take care of her mom.

talking to a sheriff and


97
0:2:54,98 --> 0:2:55,69
talking to the skate shop.

over it, this foot and
land this way.

We the real skaters.


210
0:6:45,7 --> 0:6:53,7



211
0:6:53,7 --> 0:6:54,43
Ah ha!


212
0:6:54,43 --> 0:6:55,9
Big Nate!


213
0:6:55,9 --> 0:6:58,248
It's a reunion here
real quick.


214
0:6:58,248 --> 0:6:59,498
BIG NATE: Yeah.


215
0:6:59,498 --> 0:7:2,24



216
0:7:2,24 --> 0:7:3,3
JAMES KELCH: Where it at?


217
0:7:3,3 --> 0:7:3,98
BIG NATE: Hell yeah.


218
0:7:3,98 --> 0:7:5,2
JAMES KELCH: Look at 'em!


219
0:7:5,2 --> 0:7:6,73
Ha ha ha!


220
0:7:6,73 --> 0:7:8,7
Looks like a pod.


221
0:7:8,7 --> 0:7:8,69
NED KELLER: [INAUDIBLE]


222
0:7:8,69 --> 0:7:9,852
JAMES KELCH: Yeah.


223
0:7:9,852 --> 0:7:10,63
NED KELLER: You got hair?


224
0:7:10,63 --> 0:7:11,16
JAMES KELCH: Yeah.


225
0:7:11,16 --> 0:7:12,41
NED KELLER: Damn James.


226
0:7:12,41 --> 0:7:14,78



227
0:7:14,78 --> 0:7:15,53
That's fucking cool.


228
0:7:15,53 --> 0:7:16,85
It's like you got
ear muffs on.


229
0:7:16,85 --> 0:7:18,1
What the fuck's with that?


230
0:7:18,1 --> 0:7:21,4



231
0:7:21,4 --> 0:7:22,9
JAMES KELCH: What'd
you do, shave?


232
0:7:22,9 --> 0:7:23,59
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, what's
going on man?


233
0:7:23,59 --> 0:7:24,1
Good to see you buddy.


234
0:7:24,1 --> 0:7:25,35
JAMES KELCH: Chilling.


235
0:7:25,35 --> 0:7:29,62



236
0:7:29,62 --> 0:7:30,75
This is the little block.


237
0:7:30,75 --> 0:7:33,436
We all just hang out here and
skate for no reason at all.


238
0:7:33,436 --> 0:7:35,7
PATRICK O'DELL: Nothing
to grind?


239
0:7:35,7 --> 0:7:35,7
JAMES KELCH: Right there.


240
0:7:35,7 --> 0:7:37,49
And if wasn't for me,
it wouldn't be.


241
0:7:37,49 --> 0:7:38,99
I waxed it up and
made it work.


242
0:7:38,99 --> 0:7:40,1
Everyone else was like,
what are doing?


243
0:7:40,1 --> 0:7:42,83
I was like, you got to have
a curb or something, man.


244
0:7:42,83 --> 0:7:44,33
We got a tail-slide over
there, a little


245
0:7:44,33 --> 0:7:44,89
bank down the street.


246
0:7:44,89 --> 0:7:46,43
But there's a lot of
spots around here.


247
0:7:46,43 --> 0:7:48,4
We just look up here and
skate flat ground.


248
0:7:48,4 --> 0:7:49,26
I like this spot.


249
0:7:49,26 --> 0:7:50,32
It makes me happy.


250
0:7:50,32 --> 0:8:4,25
[SKATEBOARD SOUNDS]


251
0:8:4,25 --> 0:8:5,52
NED KELLER: This is my spot.


252
0:8:5,52 --> 0:8:6,106
This is why everyone's
here right now, cause


253
0:8:6,106 --> 0:8:8,17
this where I skate.


254
0:8:8,17 --> 0:8:10,68
Everything you right now before
you is all made by me,


255
0:8:10,68 --> 0:8:16,15
100% complete.

JAMES KELCH: Hamilton's
own, Cricket.


259
0:8:20,7 --> 0:8:21,67
NED KELLER: I skated
fly here, for deep.


260
0:8:21,67 --> 0:8:23,9
And now it's like a war zone.


261
0:8:23,9 --> 0:8:25,32
Now I'm not up here to regulate,
it's all junkies and


262
0:8:25,32 --> 0:8:27,32
thugs and fucking dickheads
up here, man.


263
0:8:27,32 --> 0:8:27,75
JAMES KELCH: I won't regulate
no more, man.


264
0:8:27,75 --> 0:8:28,22
I gave up.


265
0:8:28,22 --> 0:8:30,123
NED KELLER: I'll regulate quick
though, as long as I'm


266
0:8:30,123 --> 0:8:30,32
here for a week.


267
0:8:30,32 --> 0:8:31,7
JAMES KELCH: I'm out a lot.


268
0:8:31,7 --> 0:8:32,56
NED KELLER: I broke my finger
last night having to deal with


269
0:8:32,56 --> 0:8:34,39
the junkies, man.


270
0:8:34,39 --> 0:8:34,77
He was down at the bar.


271
0:8:34,77 --> 0:8:38,706
And he was fucking starting
fights and blacked out on


272
0:8:38,706 --> 0:8:39,324
drugs or whatever the fuck


273
0:8:39,324 --> 0:8:40,169
JAMES KELCH: Yeah, as always.


274
0:8:40,169 --> 0:8:40,96
NED KELLER: And he
did it again.


275
0:8:40,96 --> 0:8:42,755
I picked him up by his
sweatshirt, picked him up,


276
0:8:42,755 --> 0:8:45,35
took him out of his seat,
slammed him on the ground.


277
0:8:45,35 --> 0:8:46,43
I drug him through the bar
like this on his back.


278
0:8:46,43 --> 0:8:48,194
He was sliding through
the park.


279
0:8:48,194 --> 0:8:52,14
I pull him like this and
the door on his ass.


280
0:8:52,14 --> 0:8:52,61
It was hilarious.


281
0:8:52,61 --> 0:8:53,24
But whatever.


282
0:8:53,24 --> 0:8:53,95
He had to get kicked out.


283
0:8:53,95 --> 0:8:56,69
JAMES KELCH: Yeah, gotta take
'em out of the game, man.


284
0:8:56,69 --> 0:8:59,94
We beat up junkies now, cause if
it used to be junkies then


285
0:8:59,94 --> 0:9:0,7
we tried to teach 'em.


286
0:9:0,7 --> 0:9:2,57
But they don't listen, so
we beat 'em all up.


287
0:9:2,57 --> 0:9:4,85
What's wrong with
your ankle, man.


288
0:9:4,85 --> 0:9:6,1
NED KELLER: He's
faking a limp.


289
0:9:6,1 --> 0:9:8,6



290
0:9:8,6 --> 0:9:11,21
JAMES KELCH: Walk
straight kid.

JAMES KELCH: Embarcadero,
I mean, the


294
0:9:14,29 --> 0:9:16,59
block's holding it down.


295
0:9:16,59 --> 0:9:17,89
It's the new Embarco, son.


296
0:9:17,89 --> 0:9:20,3
We just chill here
for no reason.


297
0:9:20,3 --> 0:9:21,39
We're just here.


298
0:9:21,39 --> 0:9:23,85
Want me to do a 350,
first try for you?


299
0:9:23,85 --> 0:9:24,31
Alright.


300
0:9:24,31 --> 0:9:25,71
With my coat on and
a cigarette?


301
0:9:25,71 --> 0:9:29,81



302
0:9:29,81 --> 0:9:31,83
And I ain't skated
in six days?


303
0:9:31,83 --> 0:9:43,5
[SKATEBOARD SOUNDS]


304
0:9:43,5 --> 0:9:44,75
Not first try.


305
0:9:44,75 --> 0:9:46,24
PATRICK O'DELL: Do it again,
we'll just edit it.


306
0:9:46,24 --> 0:9:48,365
JAMES KELCH: Alright.


307
0:9:48,365 --> 0:9:51,31
You'll be to tell, though.


308
0:9:51,31 --> 0:9:52,615
And I just busted my groin.


309
0:9:52,615 --> 0:9:59,26



310
0:9:59,26 --> 0:10:2,32
PATRICK O'DELL: Oh, is
that your camera?


311
0:10:2,32 --> 0:10:4,11
JAMES KELCH: Yeah.


312
0:10:4,11 --> 0:10:6,89
This is how James starts
his car, every time.


313
0:10:6,89 --> 0:10:9,55
Cause I'm not sponsored
by Quicksilver.


314
0:10:9,55 --> 0:10:10,39
NED KELLER: Last time I checked,
I didn't think it's


315
0:10:10,39 --> 0:10:12,815
cause your car, man.


316
0:10:12,815 --> 0:10:15,73



317
0:10:15,73 --> 0:10:16,98
JAMES KELCH: I ain't getting
no Quicksilver money.


318
0:10:16,98 --> 0:10:23,29



319
0:10:23,29 --> 0:10:27,7
Well, you just quit jocking.


320
0:10:27,7 --> 0:10:28,29
PATRICK O'DELL: You think when
you go to other cities like


321
0:10:28,29 --> 0:10:30,63
San Francisco people
don't believe that


322
0:10:30,63 --> 0:10:33,56
Ohio has shitty areas.


323
0:10:33,56 --> 0:10:34,37
JAMES KELCH: Ah, yeah.


324
0:10:34,37 --> 0:10:36,86
I used to tell the guys, back
when I was younger on the


325
0:10:36,86 --> 0:10:38,15
Embarcadero, I'd tell the dudes
all the time, I'd be


326
0:10:38,15 --> 0:10:40,915
like, man, if I brought all
the crazy, natty dudes out


327
0:10:40,915 --> 0:10:42,87
here they'd take this
whole city over.


328
0:10:42,87 --> 0:10:44,75
There's some rough, rugged
individuals.


329
0:10:44,75 --> 0:10:48,1



330
0:10:48,1 --> 0:10:51,29
But most of them are just
backwards as fuck.


331
0:10:51,29 --> 0:10:53,42
Never been to a real place,
don't know anything except


332
0:10:53,42 --> 0:10:55,33
their block.


333
0:10:55,33 --> 0:10:57,88
Real closed in views
about everything.


334
0:10:57,88 --> 0:11:1,115
Like any time anyone around
even hears the word San


335
0:11:1,115 --> 0:11:2,5
Francisco "I heard
about that place.


336
0:11:2,5 --> 0:11:4,831
All faggots."


337
0:11:4,831 --> 0:11:6,996
Here look at this.


338
0:11:6,996 --> 0:11:9,83
From right here, where these
two big 12-storey projects


339
0:11:9,83 --> 0:11:13,11
start, all the way over, as
far as you can see, brick.


340
0:11:13,11 --> 0:11:15,86
All over again, til you see
that red Sheraton, all the


341
0:11:15,86 --> 0:11:18,89
way, all the way, all the
way, all the way--


342
0:11:18,89 --> 0:11:19,54
So right there.


343
0:11:19,54 --> 0:11:21,73
That's nothing but projects
and ghetto.


344
0:11:21,73 --> 0:11:22,53
That's all that is.


345
0:11:22,53 --> 0:11:23,75
You don't even want
to go through it.


346
0:11:23,75 --> 0:11:25,338
It's gnarly.


347
0:11:25,338 --> 0:11:27,53
PATRICK O'DELL: So your
neighborhood is not as bad?


348
0:11:27,53 --> 0:11:29,63
JAMES KELCH: My neighborhood,
like you saw, I just leave my


349
0:11:29,63 --> 0:11:31,88
keys in my car, my boards
on my porch.


350
0:11:31,88 --> 0:11:33,3
UPS just throws the shit.


351
0:11:33,3 --> 0:11:34,64
On the front yard.


352
0:11:34,64 --> 0:11:35,5
Whatever.


353
0:11:35,5 --> 0:11:37,82
Yeah, my neighborhood's fine.


354
0:11:37,82 --> 0:11:40,13
PATRICK O'DELL: Look at
that smoke it's like--


355
0:11:40,13 --> 0:11:41,59
JAMES KELCH: Factories.


356
0:11:41,59 --> 0:11:42,7
It's gross.


357
0:11:42,7 --> 0:11:43,62
Look at all those bubble
places up there.


358
0:11:43,62 --> 0:11:45,11
You see those little white
things in the hill?


359
0:11:45,11 --> 0:11:49,72
It's like some kind of fucking
crazy Avon test on monkeys


360
0:11:49,72 --> 0:11:51,79
factory or something.


361
0:11:51,79 --> 0:11:55,216
PATRICK O'DELL: How do you
drinking and drugs affects


362
0:11:55,216 --> 0:11:57,21
skating or effected
your skating.


363
0:11:57,21 --> 0:11:59,98
JAMES KELCH: Even in my early
interviews and shit, I was


364
0:11:59,98 --> 0:12:2,24
dropping hella little hints.


365
0:12:2,24 --> 0:12:5,11
I would say so much stuff that
strictly referred to me doing


366
0:12:5,11 --> 0:12:6,53
drugs and I was out
of control.


367
0:12:6,53 --> 0:12:8,12
It was hilarious.


368
0:12:8,12 --> 0:12:10,6
PATRICK O'DELL: Wasn't
Hubba Hide Out?


369
0:12:10,6 --> 0:12:12,54
JAMES KELCH: Hubba Hide Out was
named that because me and


370
0:12:12,54 --> 0:12:14,94
people I won't mention, because
there's no reason to


371
0:12:14,94 --> 0:12:16,7
drag them through the dirt.


372
0:12:16,7 --> 0:12:19,35
We'd go out there we would
smoke hella rocks, man.


373
0:12:19,35 --> 0:12:20,6
Crack.


374
0:12:20,6 --> 0:12:22,17



375
0:12:22,17 --> 0:12:23,43
Straight up.


376
0:12:23,43 --> 0:12:26,43
Lots of people that
everybody knows.


377
0:12:26,43 --> 0:12:28,83
So many, you would
never even think.


378
0:12:28,83 --> 0:12:29,56
PATRICK O'DELL: So did
you come up with


379
0:12:29,56 --> 0:12:31,43
the term Hubba, then?


380
0:12:31,43 --> 0:12:32,855
JAMES KELCH: Someone tried to
give me credit for that one


381
0:12:32,855 --> 0:12:34,6
time, like I made up that word.


382
0:12:34,6 --> 0:12:34,9
But nah.


383
0:12:34,9 --> 0:12:37,75
I used to hear the little
ghetto kid saying it.


384
0:12:37,75 --> 0:12:42,6
It's just a slang term for crack
from the ghetto kids.


385
0:12:42,6 --> 0:12:45,38
PATRICK O'DELL: But as a term
that's used in skateboarding?


386
0:12:45,38 --> 0:12:46,76
JAMES KELCH: Ah yeah, for
sure come up with it.


387
0:12:46,76 --> 0:12:47,63
I called it Hubba Hideout.


388
0:12:47,63 --> 0:12:48,68
"Let's go to the
Hubba Hideout.


389
0:12:48,68 --> 0:12:49,88
Let's go to the Hubba.


390
0:12:49,88 --> 0:12:50,47
Let's go to the Hubba."


391
0:12:50,47 --> 0:12:51,29
PATRICK O'DELL: Before people
were even skating there?


392
0:12:51,29 --> 0:12:53,11
JAMES KELCH: But it was called
Hubba, just the spot.


393
0:12:53,11 --> 0:12:55,6
It wasn't even that rail,
down those stairs.


394
0:12:55,6 --> 0:12:55,56
It was actually--


395
0:12:55,56 --> 0:12:57,19
If you went up the stairs
there's a little plaza.


396
0:12:57,19 --> 0:12:58,56
You can sit on benches.


397
0:12:58,56 --> 0:13:0,63
That was Hubba Hideout.


398
0:13:0,63 --> 0:13:2,2
We started noticing that
they could see us from


399
0:13:2,2 --> 0:13:2,96
the building windows.


400
0:13:2,96 --> 0:13:3,93
So we started moving down.


401
0:13:3,93 --> 0:13:5,212
We would hide on the stairs
and the Hubba


402
0:13:5,212 --> 0:13:6,64
would hide our faces.


403
0:13:6,64 --> 0:13:8,12
No one could tell we were
sitting there from the sides.


404
0:13:8,12 --> 0:13:10,22
Back in the day, before it was
actually turned into a skate


405
0:13:10,22 --> 0:13:12,8
spot, people would just be like,
"Oh let's got to the


406
0:13:12,8 --> 0:13:13,34
Hubba." That's where we'd
go drink, smoke


407
0:13:13,34 --> 0:13:14,56
weed, do drugs, whatever.


408
0:13:14,56 --> 0:13:15,73
No one could see.


409
0:13:15,73 --> 0:13:17,44
And then one day, we were
leaving after smoking weed and


410
0:13:17,44 --> 0:13:19,95
drinking and Mike Carol just
flat-out olied the first set


411
0:13:19,95 --> 0:13:23,56
of stairs in and then
rail slid the Hubba.


412
0:13:23,56 --> 0:13:24,86
We all just fell out.


413
0:13:24,86 --> 0:13:25,84
No one even knew.


414
0:13:25,84 --> 0:13:27,3
No one looked at that.


415
0:13:27,3 --> 0:13:27,78
No one was going to say like--


416
0:13:27,78 --> 0:13:30,39
We'd jump the stairs and
thought that was sick,


417
0:13:30,39 --> 0:13:30,92
straight up.


418
0:13:30,92 --> 0:13:32,19
Jumping those stairs was
big back in the day.


419
0:13:32,19 --> 0:13:34,23
That was a big set
of stairs, man.


420
0:13:34,23 --> 0:13:35,5
Hubba Hideout.


421
0:13:35,5 --> 0:13:36,89
Now everywhere is a Hubba,
every spot's a Hubba.


422
0:13:36,89 --> 0:13:37,84
It trips me out.


423
0:13:37,84 --> 0:13:39,382
It's like, what?


424
0:13:39,382 --> 0:13:41,37
That's not a Hubba.


425
0:13:41,37 --> 0:13:42,93
There's only one Hubba, nigga.


426
0:13:42,93 --> 0:13:46,7



427
0:13:46,7 --> 0:13:49,15
There we are.


428
0:13:49,15 --> 0:13:50,99
It didn't turn her off,
she's still running.


429
0:13:50,99 --> 0:13:52,24
Yeah.


430
0:13:52,24 --> 0:15:52,24
