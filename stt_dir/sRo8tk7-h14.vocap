###28 ADRI MURGUIA: The following morning, Faustino began making
###31 the last preparations before a trip to the Green Lake, which
###33 is a day's horse ride away.
###36 We would spend the night there.
###37 And so we needed to take enough supplies to get us
###39 through our stay.
###40 
###43 The Green Lake was the first piece of land
###45 he owned out here.
###46 And it was also central to his cattle business.
###48 He hadn't returned for over four years, but
###51 we didn't know why.

###116 ADRI MURGUIA: Every inch of land that we crossed over to
###119 get to the Green Lake belongs to Faustino.
###121 It was a six hour journey.
###123 We were only halfway there.
###124 And the crew felt exhausted by the attacks of the
###127 blood-sucking horseflies.
###128 But Faustino and Marcos were unfazed, even by the
###131 blistering sun that barely sets during the summer.

###171 ADRI MURGUIA: When we finally arrived, after six hours of
###173 riding our horses, and encountered Faustino's
###175 settlement that he had left behind, we started
###178 setting up our camp.
###179 And Marcos began cooking the lamb we had
###180 killed the day before.

###288 couldn't wait to have our only meal of the day.

###309 
###319 I think Marcos is going to take over the land when
###323 Faustino finishes his time here.
###329 He's inheriting this whole thing.
###331 He lives in O'Higgins and he has a family.
###333 But he's planning on bringing them here.
###337 I don't know, I don't think he's trying to take advantage
###338 of him or anything.
###340 Seems like a nice guy.

###446 ADRI MURGUIA: After spending the night, we gathered that
###448 Faustino hadn't returned to the Green Lake since 2007,
###451 when his nephew started stealing his cattle and
###453 selling the meat in nearby towns.
###456 Due to his age and the vast amount of land on this
###458 property, it was impossible for him to keep it under
###460 constant surveillance.
###462 Feeling powerless over what was happening to him, he let
###465 his cattle run free and brought in Marcos Lancaster to
###468 take care of it, but more importantly, to protect him.
###471 
###482 FAUSTINO BARRIENTOS: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###490 ADRI MURGUIA: It's impossible to understand who Faustino
###493 really is, when like his nephew or brother, we have a
###496 very limited view of the life of a man that has spent most
###498 of his time on Earth alone.
###501 He shared some stories with us, but who knows what he's
###503 chosen to keep to himself.
###505 And it's difficult to say whether or not we would have
###507 liked to meet him 30 years ago, when he was very
###509 different, given the few things we know about him now.
###512 
###515 Here's an 81-year-old man that is kind and welcoming.
###519 And it might seem natural to see him living alone.
###522 But he makes it look so simple, when the few days
###525 we've been here have proven that we couldn't have survived
###527 without him.
###529 
###537 As we made our way back to Faustino's home, we have to
###540 get ready to return to New York.

###561 After spending four days with him, it's impossible to
###564 imagine spending a lifetime in Chilean Patagonia, imitating
###568 the way of life of the original gauchos, something
###571 Faustino Barrientos is trying to preserve.
