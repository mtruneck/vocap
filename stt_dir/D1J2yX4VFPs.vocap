###9 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: That`s right, go Huskies. Thanks to Mrs. Pinkerton`s class for getting
###13 things started today. We`re fortunate that you sent that in. I`m Carl Azuz. Your Tuesday
###18 edition of CNN STUDENT NEWS is here.
###33 The U.S. presidential election is exactly three weeks away. Some Americans know whom
###38 they are voting for, others might not have made up their minds just yet. Now, it might
###43 help some people if they could directly ask the presidential candidates questions themselves,
###48 and that`s exactly what some people are going to be able to do tonight. It is the second
###53 U.S. presidential debate. President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt
###57 Romney will face off at Hofstra University in New York. CNN is part of this, too. Candy
###63 Crowley, our chief political correspondent, is moderating tonight`s event.
###67 You might wonder why there aren`t any third party candidates, why there aren`t any other
###71 candidates in this debates. The group that organizes them has rules for who can participate
###76 based on how much support a candidate has. President Obama and Governor Romney are the
###81 only candidates who meet all of the requirements. Tonight`s debate will be different from the
###85 one two weeks ago. It`s a town hall format, that`s why audience members will get to ask
###90 the candidates questions directly.
###92 Athena Jones looks at what makes this format unique.
###97 Round Two. President Obama and Governor Mitt Romney face off in their second debate Tuesday,
###103 a town hall moderated by CNN`s Candy Crowley who says the format presents unique challenges
###108 for the candidates.
###109 CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Now, the challenge is that they`ve got to connect,
###112 not just with the people that are looking into the television, and watching them, but
###116 to the people that are on the stage with them, some 80 or so undecided voters as chosen by
###122 Gallup. So they have to keep those folks in mind, it`s a much more intimate and up close
###127 adventure with voters.
###129 JONES: President Obama is under pressure. After his last turn on the debate stage, he
###133 got bad reviews.
###134 ANA NAVARRO, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: One bad debate is losing a battle. Two bad debates
###140 could very well mean he loses the war.
###142 MARIA CARDONA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: And I think you`re going to see a very different
###145 President Obama this time around. He`s got to be seen as being aggressive, but yet he
###150 can`t be seen as being overly aggressive.
###152 JONES: Romney has enjoyed a post debate bounce in national polls, and a boost of confidence
###157 on the campaign trail.
###158 MITT ROMNEY, ( R ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There is more energy and passion people are
###161 getting behind this campaign.
###162 JONES: At a town hall without a podium and with audience interaction, the candidates`
###168 style and body language can take on added weight. At the first town hall style presidential
###173 debate in 1992, President George W.H. Bush repeatedly checked his watch, a sign some
###180 thought that he didn`t want to be there.
###183 Commentators said Bill Clinton walking towards the audience to answer a question about the
###187 recession highlighted his ability to connect with voters. One thing that can make it hard
###192 for a candidate to be aggressive is a question like this.
###195 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can we focus on the issues and not the personalities and the mud?
###199 JONES: Analysts say the format could be good for the president.
###202 CARDONA: He will absolutely be able to draw from that energy, from the energy of the public
###208 and the crowd.
###209 JONES: As for Romney ...
###210 NAVARRO: One of his big challenges during this entire campaign, has been not being able
###216 to connect with the common man and woman and child. He`s got to be able to come across
###222 as connecting, he`s got to come across as genuine, as caring as likable.
###226 CROWLEY: The candidate that makes the connection with the person asking the question is also
###230 I think making a better connection with the folks back home.

###234 AZUZ: On this day in history, in 1793, Marie-Antoinette was sent to the guillotine and beheaded during
###241 the height of the French Revolution. In 1859, John Brown led a raid against an armory in
###247 Harpers Ferry, attempting to start a revolt that would end slavery. It was a major event
###252 leading up to the U.S. Civil War. And in 1995, the Million Man March took place in Washington,
###258 D.C. The goal is to promote unity and values among African Americans. It was one of the
###263 largest gatherings of its kind in U.S. history.

###268 JOHN F. KENNEDY: Good evening, my fellow citizens. This government, as promised, has maintained
###276 the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba. Within the
###283 past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile
###291 sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of this bases can be non
###299 other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere.
###306 In U.S. it`s called the Cuban missile crisis. In the Soviet Union it was knows as the Caribbean
###314 crisis, and in Cuba it was the October crisis. Whatever it was called, the 13 day standoff
###319 in 1962 brought the U.S. and the Soviet Union right to the edge of a nuclear war. And it
###326 all started 50 years ago this week. That`s when U.S. spy planes took pictures of Soviet
###331 missiles at launch sites in Cuba. This missiles could carry nuclear warheads and if they were
###337 launched, they could hit the U.S. East Coast in just minutes. President Kennedy`s response
###343 was to launch a naval blockade against Cuba. It was designed to stop additional Soviet
###348 missiles from getting to the island. Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev negotiated
###353 a solution and the Soviet missiles were eventually returned from Cuba. Omar Lopez had a front
###359 row seat to the Cuban missile crisis. Those secret Soviet launch sites, one of them was
###364 built on Omar`s family farm. And 50 years later, he took Patrick Oppmann out to see
###369 the remains of the moment in history.
###371 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###371 PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Omar takes us out to see what`s left of this Soviet camp
###376 by mule.
###377 OMAR LOPEZ, CUBAN FARMER: There were a lot of them, I can`t remember, if it was five
###382 or six barracks of soldiers.
###385 OPPMANN: Now, nature has retaken the once sprawling missile base.
###390 So, here in the middle of the jungle of some of the last visible remnants of the huge Soviet
###394 base that was once here, and we don`t know what this building was, but it looks like
###398 it was one of the huge hangars that they actually stored the missiles in, and here are some
###403 of the farmers in the area, have repurposed this enormous concrete supports and have actually
###409 used them to create a pen to keep their pigs in.
###413 From here, we continue on foot and find the missile launch pad with a faded plaque marking
###419 how close the world came to nuclear war.
###422 It was over this area 50 years ago that U.S. spy planes caught the first glimpse of Soviet
###428 nuclear missiles. The photos they took within just a few days would catapult much of the
###433 world into a panic.
###437 Omar said a news blackout meant he had no idea that the missiles like the ones on the
###441 old farm nearly caused the U.S. to invade Cuba.
###445 LOPEZ (through translator): We were lucky that wasn`t war, after the atomic bombs and
###450 the sickness that would have come, there wouldn`t have been a single Cuban left and there would
###456 not have been many of you left either.
###458 OPPMANN: To avoid war, the Soviets removed the missiles and troops. Patrick Oppmann,
###464 CNN, near San Cristobal, Cuba.

###505 AZUZ: So, those were all college teams. Florida is also home to South Plantation High School`s
###511 Paladins. The team played its homecoming game last week. And the Paladins third string quarterback
###516 had to pull double duty. That`s because she -- yes, she -- was also crowned homecoming
###521 queen. Erin Damiglio (ph) didn`t get any playing time in her team`s win, but she has been on
###527 the field this season, and it`s believed that when that happened, Erin became the first
###531 female quarterback to play high school football in Florida. When she was crowned homecoming
###536 queen, she had a teammate by her side, one of the team`s receivers who said it was an
###541 honor to be there with her, was crowned king.
