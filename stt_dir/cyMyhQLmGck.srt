LEO PARENTE: Guys, I need your
help to come up with the


5
0:0:29,33 --> 0:0:30,59
content for a new show.


6
0:0:30,59 --> 0:0:32,176
Here's how I envision
this next show.


7
0:0:32,176 --> 0:0:32,532
IAN WHELAN: OK.


8
0:0:32,532 --> 0:0:34,26
LEO PARENTE: With all the
politics going on in racing,


9
0:0:34,26 --> 0:0:37,16
all the personal agendas,
I want to start the next


10
0:0:37,16 --> 0:0:39,72
"SHAKEDOWN" with this subject.


11
0:0:39,72 --> 0:0:42,95
DRIVE "SHAKEDOWN" is going
to design the ideal North


12
0:0:42,95 --> 0:0:45,4
American racing, the collection
of races and race


13
0:0:45,4 --> 0:0:49,77
cars that will grow racing,
reduce the clutter, motivate


14
0:0:49,77 --> 0:0:52,52
the influx of money,
media, and fans.


15
0:0:52,52 --> 0:0:55,32
So I need your guys' help
to figure out how


16
0:0:55,32 --> 0:0:56,707
we fill that up.


17
0:0:56,707 --> 0:1:0,45



18
0:1:0,45 --> 0:1:2,225
What racing-- was is the
ideal that we want?


19
0:1:2,225 --> 0:1:2,54
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


20
0:1:2,54 --> 0:1:3,32
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


21
0:1:3,32 --> 0:1:5,48
LEO PARENTE: You've been through
"SHAKEDOWN." Thank you


22
0:1:5,48 --> 0:1:6,61
for joining the team.


23
0:1:6,61 --> 0:1:7,9
MAX SEEGER: Oh, my pleasure.


24
0:1:7,9 --> 0:1:8,25
LEO PARENTE: But we've
done stuff--


25
0:1:8,25 --> 0:1:9,38
the Michael Johnson thing.


26
0:1:9,38 --> 0:1:9,71
MAX SEEGER: Yes.


27
0:1:9,71 --> 0:1:10,385
LEO PARENTE: Race
of Champions.


28
0:1:10,385 --> 0:1:11,15
MAX SEEGER: That's right.


29
0:1:11,15 --> 0:1:11,52
IAN WHELAN: Right.


30
0:1:11,52 --> 0:1:13,41
LEO PARENTE: And you seem to
have this passion for racing


31
0:1:13,41 --> 0:1:15,42
outside of F1.


32
0:1:15,42 --> 0:1:17,47
IAN WHELAN: Well, I'm mostly
an F1 fan, but I can


33
0:1:17,47 --> 0:1:19,15
appreciate other racing.


34
0:1:19,15 --> 0:1:24,13
And I think that there are
certain things that I like


35
0:1:24,13 --> 0:1:26,95
about F1 that maybe we could
apply to other racing or maybe


36
0:1:26,95 --> 0:1:30,33
things from that past of F1 that
we could apply to other


37
0:1:30,33 --> 0:1:32,39
racing, because I don't
necessarily think F1's at its


38
0:1:32,39 --> 0:1:33,62
peak right now.


39
0:1:33,62 --> 0:1:35,68
LEO PARENTE: So I want to
pretend this is like Hot Tub


40
0:1:35,68 --> 0:1:38,68
Time Machine," where
it's all new.


41
0:1:38,68 --> 0:1:39,72
It's all fresh.


42
0:1:39,72 --> 0:1:40,55
We can start over.


43
0:1:40,55 --> 0:1:45,0
And I know there are some rules
of reality, but we're


44
0:1:45,0 --> 0:1:45,6
going to wipe it clean.


45
0:1:45,6 --> 0:1:46,2
MAX SEEGER: OK.


46
0:1:46,2 --> 0:1:47,79
LEO PARENTE: And I want to focus
on North America only.


47
0:1:47,79 --> 0:1:49,38
Let's not try to chomp off
the world right now.


48
0:1:49,38 --> 0:1:50,5
IAN WHELAN: OK.


49
0:1:50,5 --> 0:1:51,6
LEO PARENTE: And without getting
too much into the


50
0:1:51,6 --> 0:1:55,34
criteria, I think we should talk
a little bit about what


51
0:1:55,34 --> 0:1:58,27
we think racing needs to
accomplish to be more popular,


52
0:1:58,27 --> 0:2:1,28
and then cut through the
elements of the action or the


53
0:2:1,28 --> 0:2:3,26
cars or the venues or the
media or whatever.


54
0:2:3,26 --> 0:2:4,94
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


55
0:2:4,94 --> 0:2:6,8
LEO PARENTE: Let me start
with just that.


56
0:2:6,8 --> 0:2:8,94
What do you want racing
to be to be better?


57
0:2:8,94 --> 0:2:12,37
IAN WHELAN: Well, I think racing
needs to be a little


58
0:2:12,37 --> 0:2:14,3
bit less opaque.


59
0:2:14,3 --> 0:2:19,7
Right now, I see cars running
around tracks that I can't


60
0:2:19,7 --> 0:2:22,79
tell how they relate to any
real cars on the road.


61
0:2:22,79 --> 0:2:24,9
And I'm saying that
as an F1 fan.


62
0:2:24,9 --> 0:2:27,66
I actually love the crazy
technology of F1.


63
0:2:27,66 --> 0:2:31,94
But I think aside from that
racing, there needs to be--


64
0:2:31,94 --> 0:2:34,35
the lower tiers or the sports
car racing, I need to be able


65
0:2:34,35 --> 0:2:38,2
to relate those cars to
things on the road.


66
0:2:38,2 --> 0:2:38,94
LEO PARENTE: Why?


67
0:2:38,94 --> 0:2:39,2
IAN WHELAN: Why?


68
0:2:39,2 --> 0:2:42,86
Because I think if you're a fan
of Porsches or you're a


69
0:2:42,86 --> 0:2:44,22
fan of Fords--


70
0:2:44,22 --> 0:2:46,94



71
0:2:46,94 --> 0:2:50,84
you're a fan of something,
you want to root for


72
0:2:50,84 --> 0:2:51,82
that kind of thing.


73
0:2:51,82 --> 0:2:54,62
You want to have
an allegiance.


74
0:2:54,62 --> 0:2:55,15
LEO PARENTE: OK.


75
0:2:55,15 --> 0:2:59,15
And I think racing is in that
interesting spot where no one


76
0:2:59,15 --> 0:3:1,79
cares, really, about the soccer
ball, or who made the


77
0:3:1,79 --> 0:3:4,9
baseball bat, or how
it's constructed.


78
0:3:4,9 --> 0:3:5,23
They watch the sport.


79
0:3:5,23 --> 0:3:9,2
But because the tool is so
integral to racing, I guess it


80
0:3:9,2 --> 0:3:10,7
does matter.


81
0:3:10,7 --> 0:3:11,42
Max, you're looking at me.


82
0:3:11,42 --> 0:3:12,5
I know you've got something.


83
0:3:12,5 --> 0:3:12,48
MAX SEEGER: Yeah, yeah.


84
0:3:12,48 --> 0:3:17,15
Well, no, because the thing is,
for me, I understand that


85
0:3:17,15 --> 0:3:21,68
there are a lot of subtle things
happening on the track.


86
0:3:21,68 --> 0:3:24,72
And I appreciate it, totally.


87
0:3:24,72 --> 0:3:25,31
But--


88
0:3:25,31 --> 0:3:26,0
LEO PARENTE: Don't
pander to me.


89
0:3:26,0 --> 0:3:27,1
MAX SEEGER: OK, no, no.


90
0:3:27,1 --> 0:3:32,85
But I don't know if it's
enough for me.


91
0:3:32,85 --> 0:3:36,71
So there are a lot of things
that I'm into where you have


92
0:3:36,71 --> 0:3:37,62
an appreciation of it.


93
0:3:37,62 --> 0:3:38,61
You get really into it.


94
0:3:38,61 --> 0:3:41,98
So I don't see-- unless someone
gets really into or


95
0:3:41,98 --> 0:3:47,28
understands How important it
is to get the tires up to


96
0:3:47,28 --> 0:3:51,22
temp, because there's no such
thing as doing a lap at speed


97
0:3:51,22 --> 0:3:54,17
if the tires aren't
up to temp.


98
0:3:54,17 --> 0:3:54,69
LEO PARENTE: Fuck
Adrian Newey.


99
0:3:54,69 --> 0:3:57,75
MAX SEEGER: Oh, my pleasure.


100
0:3:57,75 --> 0:4:0,95
So for me, I think that getting
an appreciation for


101
0:4:0,95 --> 0:4:3,96
that sort of stuff, maybe
there's a shortcut, maybe


102
0:4:3,96 --> 0:4:4,6
there's not.


103
0:4:4,6 --> 0:4:6,35
LEO PARENTE: So this came
up once before.


104
0:4:6,35 --> 0:4:7,19
For you--


105
0:4:7,19 --> 0:4:8,69
and there is no wrong
answer here.


106
0:4:8,69 --> 0:4:13,55
For you, watching a race car
go fast, it's not enough.


107
0:4:13,55 --> 0:4:15,366
I could watch an R18, e-tron--
whatever the


108
0:4:15,366 --> 0:4:16,25
hell they call it--


109
0:4:16,25 --> 0:4:18,99
around Sebring, and I could
catch the nuances and be


110
0:4:18,99 --> 0:4:19,88
entertained.


111
0:4:19,88 --> 0:4:22,12
But at the end of the day, maybe
you're just watching


112
0:4:22,12 --> 0:4:23,26
highway traffic.


113
0:4:23,26 --> 0:4:23,8
MAX SEEGER: Right.


114
0:4:23,8 --> 0:4:24,9
LEO PARENTE: So there
needs to be more?


115
0:4:24,9 --> 0:4:25,45
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


116
0:4:25,45 --> 0:4:27,11
I don't want to put it down.


117
0:4:27,11 --> 0:4:28,48
I'm not putting it
down in that--


118
0:4:28,48 --> 0:4:29,93
LEO PARENTE: There are
no disclaimers here.


119
0:4:29,93 --> 0:4:30,43
MAX SEEGER: OK.


120
0:4:30,43 --> 0:4:32,6
Well, and also, just going
fast isn't really enough,


121
0:4:32,6 --> 0:4:37,9
because when I was in Bangkok
for Race of Champions--


122
0:4:37,9 --> 0:4:37,91
LEO PARENTE: Hanging
with Vettel.


123
0:4:37,91 --> 0:4:38,29
MAX SEEGER: Yes.


124
0:4:38,29 --> 0:4:38,67
LEO PARENTE: Yeah,
I heard that.


125
0:4:38,67 --> 0:4:42,1
MAX SEEGER: That's where we
met each other, hung out.


126
0:4:42,1 --> 0:4:44,866
I actually didn't talk to him
at all, so I want to clear


127
0:4:44,866 --> 0:4:46,15
that up right away.


128
0:4:46,15 --> 0:4:47,6
LEO PARENTE: You blew
in his ear.


129
0:4:47,6 --> 0:4:47,57
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


130
0:4:47,57 --> 0:4:48,54
LEO PARENTE: Webber's
a wanker.


131
0:4:48,54 --> 0:4:48,97
MAX SEEGER: Yes.


132
0:4:48,97 --> 0:4:49,74
LEO PARENTE: Yeah, OK.


133
0:4:49,74 --> 0:4:52,406
MAX SEEGER: That name doesn't
really mean anything to me.


134
0:4:52,406 --> 0:4:53,81
[LAUGHTER]


135
0:4:53,81 --> 0:5:0,94
MAX SEEGER: So a guy goes
out, gets some air


136
0:5:0,94 --> 0:5:2,21
on that first lift.


137
0:5:2,21 --> 0:5:3,25
LEO PARENTE: Oh, it
was that race?


138
0:5:3,25 --> 0:5:3,637
MAX SEEGER: Yes.


139
0:5:3,637 --> 0:5:4,54
LEO PARENTE: The Race of
Champions, the bridge, the


140
0:5:4,54 --> 0:5:4,8
whole thing.


141
0:5:4,8 --> 0:5:5,1
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


142
0:5:5,1 --> 0:5:6,0
They're setting up.


143
0:5:6,0 --> 0:5:6,65
And I'm rolling.


144
0:5:6,65 --> 0:5:9,62
I get it, because I'm
a professional, OK?


145
0:5:9,62 --> 0:5:12,12



146
0:5:12,12 --> 0:5:14,12
But then they put a
chicane in there.


147
0:5:14,12 --> 0:5:15,57
LEO PARENTE: Yeah, because it
was dangerous, I guess.


148
0:5:15,57 --> 0:5:15,855
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


149
0:5:15,855 --> 0:5:18,68
And then it sort of got
less exciting for me.


150
0:5:18,68 --> 0:5:19,94
Not that I wanted
someone to get


151
0:5:19,94 --> 0:5:22,31
hurt, but air is important.


152
0:5:22,31 --> 0:5:22,9
LEO PARENTE: Wait a minute.


153
0:5:22,9 --> 0:5:23,86
Let me write that down.


154
0:5:23,86 --> 0:5:26,99
So they took away the thing
that was interesting you.


155
0:5:26,99 --> 0:5:28,5
And then it was time
to go home.


156
0:5:28,5 --> 0:5:28,94
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


157
0:5:28,94 --> 0:5:31,71
Well, then I had to stay there
up until midnight--


158
0:5:31,71 --> 0:5:31,9
IAN WHELAN: Keep shooting.


159
0:5:31,9 --> 0:5:34,895
MAX SEEGER: Yeah, And keep
shooting against my will.


160
0:5:34,895 --> 0:5:35,18
LEO PARENTE: OK.


161
0:5:35,18 --> 0:5:37,64
So actually, I'm going to use
that as a little bit of a


162
0:5:37,64 --> 0:5:38,58
segue then.


163
0:5:38,58 --> 0:5:40,95
So let's start defining
the action.


164
0:5:40,95 --> 0:5:46,1
Jordan Taylor went on about
to him, racing is passing.


165
0:5:46,1 --> 0:5:48,5
And I just negated watching
a car go fast.


166
0:5:48,5 --> 0:5:50,28
At some point in time,
is it enough?


167
0:5:50,28 --> 0:5:50,75
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


168
0:5:50,75 --> 0:5:52,625
LEO PARENTE: And you were
talking about jumps.


169
0:5:52,625 --> 0:5:53,4
MAX SEEGER: Right.


170
0:5:53,4 --> 0:5:54,615
LEO PARENTE: God knows
what video game


171
0:5:54,615 --> 0:5:55,83
he's got in his mind.


172
0:5:55,83 --> 0:5:57,21
So let's define action.


173
0:5:57,21 --> 0:5:59,25
What do you want to see
as action in racing?


174
0:5:59,25 --> 0:6:1,53
MAX SEEGER: I think that
I just want to


175
0:6:1,53 --> 0:6:4,53
see pushing the envelope.


176
0:6:4,53 --> 0:6:6,82
And maybe to me, that looks
like one wheel's off the


177
0:6:6,82 --> 0:6:10,54
ground or something like that,
because I don't know if I can


178
0:6:10,54 --> 0:6:12,91
really gauge how fast
something's going.


179
0:6:12,91 --> 0:6:15,2
IAN WHELAN: Yeah, or how
on the edge they are.


180
0:6:15,2 --> 0:6:15,24
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


181
0:6:15,24 --> 0:6:17,0
IAN WHELAN: If they look like
they're not really on the edge


182
0:6:17,0 --> 0:6:17,72
from the outside.


183
0:6:17,72 --> 0:6:17,88
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


184
0:6:17,88 --> 0:6:23,5
Maybe it's as simple as facial
expressions of a camera right


185
0:6:23,5 --> 0:6:25,42
at their face, because we're
used to seeing straight out.


186
0:6:25,42 --> 0:6:28,18
But maybe we need to see
some gnarly faces.


187
0:6:28,18 --> 0:6:29,24
IAN WHELAN: That's a
good idea, yeah.


188
0:6:29,24 --> 0:6:31,64
LEO PARENTE: Well, you know,
the old guys used to talk


189
0:6:31,64 --> 0:6:36,83
about how, F1, you could watch
Nuvolari and whoever actually


190
0:6:36,83 --> 0:6:37,51
steer the car.


191
0:6:37,51 --> 0:6:37,78
IAN WHELAN: Right.


192
0:6:37,78 --> 0:6:38,84
LEO PARENTE: And you could
see their movement.


193
0:6:38,84 --> 0:6:39,92
You could see them
working the car.


194
0:6:39,92 --> 0:6:42,17
I like MotoGP because you can
see the rider working.


195
0:6:42,17 --> 0:6:42,465
IAN WHELAN: Right.


196
0:6:42,465 --> 0:6:42,76
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


197
0:6:42,76 --> 0:6:45,19
LEO PARENTE: Now, Tony Kanaan's
a little tired


198
0:6:45,19 --> 0:6:47,27
because his head is tilted
to the left.


199
0:6:47,27 --> 0:6:51,5
And David Hobbes goes friggin'
ballistic when the car goes


200
0:6:51,5 --> 0:6:54,425
one degree off angle, because
that's an F1 slide--


201
0:6:54,425 --> 0:6:55,72
Kimi excepted.


202
0:6:55,72 --> 0:6:56,83
Are you on that page?


203
0:6:56,83 --> 0:6:58,12
We need to see more of it?


204
0:6:58,12 --> 0:6:58,81
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


205
0:6:58,81 --> 0:7:1,77
I watch F1 all the time, but I
can't even pick out some of


206
0:7:1,77 --> 0:7:3,77
things they're talking
about when they're--


207
0:7:3,77 --> 0:7:4,765
LEO PARENTE: They're
just making [BLEEP]


208
0:7:4,765 --> 0:7:5,13
up.


209
0:7:5,13 --> 0:7:6,37
IAN WHELAN: They
might be, yeah.


210
0:7:6,37 --> 0:7:9,9
Sometimes, it's like they're
talking about things that are


211
0:7:9,9 --> 0:7:12,36
going on there with--
like you said,


212
0:7:12,36 --> 0:7:13,36
they're off a few degrees.


213
0:7:13,36 --> 0:7:15,6
I can't even tell on TV.


214
0:7:15,6 --> 0:7:18,35
But to them, it's a big deal.


215
0:7:18,35 --> 0:7:20,97
So I feel like we need a
little bit of a closer


216
0:7:20,97 --> 0:7:25,9
connection to what's really
going on in these cars.


217
0:7:25,9 --> 0:7:27,905
LEO PARENTE: So that makes me
think of something else that


218
0:7:27,905 --> 0:7:29,66
we should probably cover
up front as a


219
0:7:29,66 --> 0:7:31,31
little bit of a criteria.


220
0:7:31,31 --> 0:7:33,91
So you guys think I'm deep
into the bubble.


221
0:7:33,91 --> 0:7:36,44
You're a fan, knowledgeable.


222
0:7:36,44 --> 0:7:37,66
MAX SEEGER: I'm around it.


223
0:7:37,66 --> 0:7:40,12
LEO PARENTE: I'm going to be
polite, but you're around it.


224
0:7:40,12 --> 0:7:41,548
You're more of an outsider
looking in.


225
0:7:41,548 --> 0:7:42,798
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


226
0:7:42,798 --> 0:7:44,76



227
0:7:44,76 --> 0:7:48,34
LEO PARENTE: The nuances
work for the die hard.


228
0:7:48,34 --> 0:7:50,9
But who should we
be looking at?


229
0:7:50,9 --> 0:7:52,16
Are we looking at a
bigger audience?


230
0:7:52,16 --> 0:7:55,26
Or are we looking to make a
generalist more of a disciple?


231
0:7:55,26 --> 0:7:56,32
You know what I'm
trying to say?


232
0:7:56,32 --> 0:7:56,66
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


233
0:7:56,66 --> 0:8:0,55
IAN WHELAN: I think we need to
have a little bit of both.


234
0:8:0,55 --> 0:8:5,51
Racing needs to expand, probably
for business reasons.


235
0:8:5,51 --> 0:8:8,93
And there's a lot of people who
are casual fans that maybe


236
0:8:8,93 --> 0:8:12,11
if they could learn a little bit
about the sport or find a


237
0:8:12,11 --> 0:8:17,51
way to become more engaged,
they could become a


238
0:8:17,51 --> 0:8:19,206
higher-level fan somehow.


239
0:8:19,206 --> 0:8:21,93
LEO PARENTE: What
do you think?


240
0:8:21,93 --> 0:8:25,9
MAX SEEGER: Maybe I'll tell
this quick story of--


241
0:8:25,9 --> 0:8:27,3
I overheard--


242
0:8:27,3 --> 0:8:29,33
so I skateboard.


243
0:8:29,33 --> 0:8:29,78
LEO PARENTE: Wow.


244
0:8:29,78 --> 0:8:30,196
Really?


245
0:8:30,196 --> 0:8:30,612
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


246
0:8:30,612 --> 0:8:31,3
Come see if we're--


247
0:8:31,3 --> 0:8:31,94
LEO PARENTE: And that's in
addition to the band you have.


248
0:8:31,94 --> 0:8:32,77
What's the band?


249
0:8:32,77 --> 0:8:33,88
The Price of Bandages?


250
0:8:33,88 --> 0:8:34,159
MAX SEEGER: No.


251
0:8:34,159 --> 0:8:35,23
The what?


252
0:8:35,23 --> 0:8:36,25
LEO PARENTE: I don't know.


253
0:8:36,25 --> 0:8:37,309
MAX SEEGER: The Mayor
of Bad News.


254
0:8:37,309 --> 0:8:38,49
LEO PARENTE: I was close.


255
0:8:38,49 --> 0:8:38,35
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


256
0:8:38,35 --> 0:8:38,78
LEO PARENTE: Yeah, OK.


257
0:8:38,78 --> 0:8:39,21
Go ahead.


258
0:8:39,21 --> 0:8:40,96
MAX SEEGER: So this kid's
skateboarding.


259
0:8:40,96 --> 0:8:42,789
There is a game called SKATE.


260
0:8:42,789 --> 0:8:45,19
It's like HORSE for
basketball.


261
0:8:45,19 --> 0:8:46,8
So one person does a trick.


262
0:8:46,8 --> 0:8:48,52
The other person does
a trick to match it.


263
0:8:48,52 --> 0:8:49,58
LEO PARENTE: By the way,
I'm old, not dead.


264
0:8:49,58 --> 0:8:50,8
Keep going.


265
0:8:50,8 --> 0:8:50,436
MAX SEEGER: OK.


266
0:8:50,436 --> 0:8:52,15
All right, fair enough.


267
0:8:52,15 --> 0:8:56,8
So there's your, I guess,
dominant stance.


268
0:8:56,8 --> 0:8:58,28
Maybe it's right foot forward.


269
0:8:58,28 --> 0:9:0,5
But you can also do things with
the other way, and that's


270
0:9:0,5 --> 0:9:1,7
called switch.


271
0:9:1,7 --> 0:9:4,65
It's like rediscovering
skateboarding.


272
0:9:4,65 --> 0:9:7,59
So the one kid goes to the other
kid, hey, you don't do


273
0:9:7,59 --> 0:9:9,12
any switch tricks.


274
0:9:9,12 --> 0:9:11,43
And then that kid goes,
switch tricks


275
0:9:11,43 --> 0:9:13,25
don't impress my parents.


276
0:9:13,25 --> 0:9:16,63
Because to them, it looks
like the same thing.


277
0:9:16,63 --> 0:9:19,75
So I feel like maybe that's
why I want to


278
0:9:19,75 --> 0:9:22,57
see more air stuff.


279
0:9:22,57 --> 0:9:25,64
LEO PARENTE: So have you watched
Global Rally Cross?


280
0:9:25,64 --> 0:9:27,21
MAX SEEGER: Accidentally.


281
0:9:27,21 --> 0:9:28,515
[LAUGHTER]


282
0:9:28,515 --> 0:9:30,88
LEO PARENTE: Do you
like that stuff?


283
0:9:30,88 --> 0:9:32,99
MAX SEEGER: I guess so.


284
0:9:32,99 --> 0:9:35,34
I do like those--


285
0:9:35,34 --> 0:9:39,18
the Gymkhana video
in San Francisco.


286
0:9:39,18 --> 0:9:39,6
IAN WHELAN: Right.


287
0:9:39,6 --> 0:9:41,73
That feels like you're on the
edge a little bit, right?


288
0:9:41,73 --> 0:9:42,34
MAX SEEGER: Right.


289
0:9:42,34 --> 0:9:43,46
That feels--


290
0:9:43,46 --> 0:9:47,205
IAN WHELAN: What if there was a
race on that course that Ken


291
0:9:47,205 --> 0:9:49,72
Block drove through
San Francisco?


292
0:9:49,72 --> 0:9:50,475
Wouldn't that be cool?


293
0:9:50,475 --> 0:9:51,205
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


294
0:9:51,205 --> 0:9:52,61
That would almost--


295
0:9:52,61 --> 0:9:56,65
maybe race tracks
are too sterile.


296
0:9:56,65 --> 0:9:57,26
LEO PARENTE: Funny.


297
0:9:57,26 --> 0:9:57,87
And I missed it.


298
0:9:57,87 --> 0:9:58,78
That's my disclaimer.


299
0:9:58,78 --> 0:10:1,74
But at this last X Game,
they had a new


300
0:10:1,74 --> 0:10:3,82
event called Gymkhana.


301
0:10:3,82 --> 0:10:6,22
And they basically did what
you just described.


302
0:10:6,22 --> 0:10:9,65
And I guess it was like drifting
is, plus I guess


303
0:10:9,65 --> 0:10:12,55
there was a combination of speed
or racing measurement as


304
0:10:12,55 --> 0:10:16,1
well as gymnastic type judging,
did they do the trick


305
0:10:16,1 --> 0:10:18,3
or whatever.


306
0:10:18,3 --> 0:10:23,95
So again, if it is exciting and
interesting, am I drifting


307
0:10:23,95 --> 0:10:25,14
toward it for the kids?


308
0:10:25,14 --> 0:10:25,63
MAX SEEGER: Well, that's--


309
0:10:25,63 --> 0:10:29,6
see, I don't want to
ruin racing for--


310
0:10:29,6 --> 0:10:31,91
LEO PARENTE: Yeah, but
this is the point.


311
0:10:31,91 --> 0:10:34,33
There's no definition of ruining
racing, because I feel


312
0:10:34,33 --> 0:10:36,6
like the traditionalists
are clinging


313
0:10:36,6 --> 0:10:39,39
to traditional things.


314
0:10:39,39 --> 0:10:42,8
Indy Car, for example, thinks
it's an epiphany that instead


315
0:10:42,8 --> 0:10:44,29
of having practice, qualifying,
and the race on


316
0:10:44,29 --> 0:10:47,12
Sunday, they're going to have
two races Saturday and Sunday.


317
0:10:47,12 --> 0:10:47,3
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


318
0:10:47,3 --> 0:10:49,62
LEO PARENTE:
La-dee-freaking-dah, OK?


319
0:10:49,62 --> 0:10:51,2
That's not a big epiphany.


320
0:10:51,2 --> 0:10:53,31
But if that works to attract
more people because they


321
0:10:53,31 --> 0:10:56,61
actually watch racing versus
cars going round, so be it.


322
0:10:56,61 --> 0:10:58,95
So you're not ruining racing.


323
0:10:58,95 --> 0:11:2,55
We're kind of argument that
racing is a little bit broke


324
0:11:2,55 --> 0:11:7,45
and maybe getting more broke as
no new people come to the


325
0:11:7,45 --> 0:11:9,665
sport because they've
got options.


326
0:11:9,665 --> 0:11:10,37
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


327
0:11:10,37 --> 0:11:11,65
IAN WHELAN: And we're also
talking about different--


328
0:11:11,65 --> 0:11:13,11
we're talking about a whole
sanctioning body with


329
0:11:13,11 --> 0:11:14,38
different types of
racing under it.


330
0:11:14,38 --> 0:11:16,25
So maybe certain
types of racing


331
0:11:16,25 --> 0:11:17,61
appeal to younger people.


332
0:11:17,61 --> 0:11:19,73
And then it feeds them
up along the


333
0:11:19,73 --> 0:11:20,63
way as they get older.


334
0:11:20,63 --> 0:11:25,57
Maybe they kind of graduate to
the more technical stuff that


335
0:11:25,57 --> 0:11:28,24
is not maybe as wild looking,
but there are other nuances


336
0:11:28,24 --> 0:11:29,88
that they'll pick
up as they grow.


337
0:11:29,88 --> 0:11:31,34
LEO PARENTE: Well, that's
where I was getting to.


338
0:11:31,34 --> 0:11:32,9
And I'm going in my notes.


339
0:11:32,9 --> 0:11:36,7
So under some of the objectives
I scribble out, in


340
0:11:36,7 --> 0:11:38,87
no particular order, one,
the cars are the stars.


341
0:11:38,87 --> 0:11:42,65
I think what the cars are
attract people to watch this


342
0:11:42,65 --> 0:11:44,8
and are probably going to be
leading why we need more than


343
0:11:44,8 --> 0:11:48,43
one just racing series
in this collection.


344
0:11:48,43 --> 0:11:50,3
IAN WHELAN: And that goes back
to what I was saying at the


345
0:11:50,3 --> 0:11:53,49
beginning about relating
to the cars.


346
0:11:53,49 --> 0:11:55,82
I always know there's a place
for the spaceship cars.


347
0:11:55,82 --> 0:11:56,27
I love them.


348
0:11:56,27 --> 0:12:0,7
But I feel like even when we
have cars that look like real


349
0:12:0,7 --> 0:12:2,916
cars, you still can't connect
to them as well.


350
0:12:2,916 --> 0:12:4,7
LEO PARENTE: Yeah.


351
0:12:4,7 --> 0:12:6,62
And the corollary to that is
somewhere along the line, the


352
0:12:6,62 --> 0:12:8,64
drivers have to matter.


353
0:12:8,64 --> 0:12:9,21
Action is key.


354
0:12:9,21 --> 0:12:10,46
We already talked about that.


355
0:12:10,46 --> 0:12:12,97
I think we've got to address
technology, because somewhere


356
0:12:12,97 --> 0:12:16,41
between dumbing it down and spec
cars and all this stuff--


357
0:12:16,41 --> 0:12:17,42
NASCAR--


358
0:12:17,42 --> 0:12:20,7
versus people loving the
technology and making it


359
0:12:20,7 --> 0:12:22,12
relevant, at the end of the
day, we're having the


360
0:12:22,12 --> 0:12:26,62
discussion about what the fans
want, the venues, where this


361
0:12:26,62 --> 0:12:28,69
is, how it's set up.


362
0:12:28,69 --> 0:12:31,47
Everyone loves traditional road
courses, but something


363
0:12:31,47 --> 0:12:34,0
new and different may be
a better way to go.


364
0:12:34,0 --> 0:12:34,8
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


365
0:12:34,8 --> 0:12:37,65
Like we were talking about,
a street course on some


366
0:12:37,65 --> 0:12:41,18
crazy-looking terrain
in San Francisco.


367
0:12:41,18 --> 0:12:44,45
That looks so cool in a lot of
different types of racing.


368
0:12:44,45 --> 0:12:45,85
I know it's difficult
to do, but--


369
0:12:45,85 --> 0:12:47,41
LEO PARENTE: Well, and that's
the part where we're not


370
0:12:47,41 --> 0:12:49,5
getting way too ahead
of our ourselves.


371
0:12:49,5 --> 0:12:51,6
Is it real or is it virtual?


372
0:12:51,6 --> 0:12:52,91
There will never be a
New York Grand Prix.


373
0:12:52,91 --> 0:12:56,34
But virtually, I can get on the
sim and I can run around


374
0:12:56,34 --> 0:12:57,75
Columbus Circle in a race car.


375
0:12:57,75 --> 0:12:58,17
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


376
0:12:58,17 --> 0:12:59,43
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


377
0:12:59,43 --> 0:13:0,68
LEO PARENTE: And then somewhere
along the line,


378
0:13:0,68 --> 0:13:2,15
media has to factor in.


379
0:13:2,15 --> 0:13:2,7
MAX SEEGER: Right.


380
0:13:2,7 --> 0:13:5,296
LEO PARENTE: I love banging on
the TV guys, but-- or even


381
0:13:5,296 --> 0:13:6,14
doing internet, but maybe.


382
0:13:6,14 --> 0:13:10,7
IAN WHELAN: Well, the media
thing connects with the


383
0:13:10,7 --> 0:13:12,1
drivers as stars aspect.


384
0:13:12,1 --> 0:13:16,72
To me, those two things are
related because I think that,


385
0:13:16,72 --> 0:13:20,11
especially in this country, the
media coverage of these


386
0:13:20,11 --> 0:13:23,63
people who are driving these
cars is kind of lacking.


387
0:13:23,63 --> 0:13:26,47
I've watch some of the Sky
Sports coverage in the BBC,


388
0:13:26,47 --> 0:13:30,83
and they do a much better job
of letting you get to know


389
0:13:30,83 --> 0:13:31,45
these guys.


390
0:13:31,45 --> 0:13:33,78
And then you feel more of
a connection to them.


391
0:13:33,78 --> 0:13:35,56
And I think that's important.


392
0:13:35,56 --> 0:13:36,65
When you watch football--


393
0:13:36,65 --> 0:13:40,5
I'm not even a football fan,
but I know that people have


394
0:13:40,5 --> 0:13:43,345
their favorite players, and
you're rooting for these guys.


395
0:13:43,345 --> 0:13:45,53
LEO PARENTE: So I would argue
that the roadmap is out there.


396
0:13:45,53 --> 0:13:49,37
You can take an entity that may
be complex and nuanced but


397
0:13:49,37 --> 0:13:50,81
make it play at a couple
of levels.


398
0:13:50,81 --> 0:13:51,18
IAN WHELAN: Right.


399
0:13:51,18 --> 0:13:52,54
LEO PARENTE: You can make the
personalities matter.


400
0:13:52,54 --> 0:13:54,89
You can break down what's
really going on.


401
0:13:54,89 --> 0:13:55,94
And you can do things.


402
0:13:55,94 --> 0:13:59,38
As much as everyone hates PKs
and all that stuff in soccer,


403
0:13:59,38 --> 0:14:3,37
you can break it down and make
excitement, I guess, if you


404
0:14:3,37 --> 0:14:7,403
have to, as long as you manage
it so it respects the game.


405
0:14:7,403 --> 0:14:8,11
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


406
0:14:8,11 --> 0:14:10,545
LEO PARENTE: And actually, that
leads to who's going to


407
0:14:10,545 --> 0:14:11,72
run this thing.


408
0:14:11,72 --> 0:14:15,63
And the simplest way that I'd
throw it out is that you've


409
0:14:15,63 --> 0:14:16,37
got to follow the money.


410
0:14:16,37 --> 0:14:16,93
The tools are there.


411
0:14:16,93 --> 0:14:20,63
The manufacturers have the most
money, the most vested


412
0:14:20,63 --> 0:14:23,7
interest, probably sponsors
and probably media.


413
0:14:23,7 --> 0:14:26,25
So there should be
this little Mafia


414
0:14:26,25 --> 0:14:27,3
collective of these people.


415
0:14:27,3 --> 0:14:30,19
They throw their money in, put
the kitty in the game.


416
0:14:30,19 --> 0:14:33,2
That's the money to fund the
type of media that needs to be


417
0:14:33,2 --> 0:14:36,0
done, the type of commitment
that needs to be made, whether


418
0:14:36,0 --> 0:14:39,71
it's a kids' program or a junior
program to bring young


419
0:14:39,71 --> 0:14:44,31
sperm into racing rather
than Rich Dad 101.


420
0:14:44,31 --> 0:14:46,46
And then, they're the ones--


421
0:14:46,46 --> 0:14:49,32
frankly, as a benevolent
dictatorship, they're the ones


422
0:14:49,32 --> 0:14:50,4
that start to make decisions.


423
0:14:50,4 --> 0:14:51,75
But we're playing that role.


424
0:14:51,75 --> 0:14:53,205
That's the role I want
to play right now.


425
0:14:53,205 --> 0:14:53,7
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


426
0:14:53,7 --> 0:14:56,37
LEO PARENTE: So if that sounded


427
0:14:56,37 --> 0:14:58,34
too serious, I apologize.


428
0:14:58,34 --> 0:15:0,59
But now, it kind of cuts
to, so what racing


429
0:15:0,59 --> 0:15:2,79
series should we have?


430
0:15:2,79 --> 0:15:6,6
IAN WHELAN: Well, for sports
cars, I want to see something


431
0:15:6,6 --> 0:15:8,2
like Can-Am again--


432
0:15:8,2 --> 0:15:8,88
LEO PARENTE: The old--


433
0:15:8,88 --> 0:15:10,24
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


434
0:15:10,24 --> 0:15:10,83
MAX SEEGER: What is--


435
0:15:10,83 --> 0:15:11,34
LEO PARENTE: Which part?


436
0:15:11,34 --> 0:15:12,185
No rules?


437
0:15:12,185 --> 0:15:12,46
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


438
0:15:12,46 --> 0:15:13,39
I like the--


439
0:15:13,39 --> 0:15:14,22
MAX SEEGER: What is that?


440
0:15:14,22 --> 0:15:15,99
IAN WHELAN: Can-Am
was a series--


441
0:15:15,99 --> 0:15:16,885
what is it--


442
0:15:16,885 --> 0:15:17,825
up through the '80s.


443
0:15:17,825 --> 0:15:19,606
I know it started '60s.


444
0:15:19,606 --> 0:15:20,1
LEO PARENTE: Yeah.


445
0:15:20,1 --> 0:15:21,5
The good stuff was '70s.


446
0:15:21,5 --> 0:15:23,28
IAN WHELAN: And it was basically
like an unrestricted


447
0:15:23,28 --> 0:15:23,97
racing series.


448
0:15:23,97 --> 0:15:25,17
These guys had--


449
0:15:25,17 --> 0:15:27,34
they could do anything they
wanted, basically.


450
0:15:27,34 --> 0:15:28,97
Were there really
any big rules?


451
0:15:28,97 --> 0:15:30,33
LEO PARENTE: There were
minimal rules.


452
0:15:30,33 --> 0:15:31,38
It was an open formula
with them.


453
0:15:31,38 --> 0:15:34,3
IAN WHELAN: And it was
popular in America.


454
0:15:34,3 --> 0:15:37,47
A lot of European guys came over
to race, and they built


455
0:15:37,47 --> 0:15:39,46
these cars that were
just wild.


456
0:15:39,46 --> 0:15:41,45
They were just completely
wild.


457
0:15:41,45 --> 0:15:43,67
LEO PARENTE: Chaparral put
wings on it for the first


458
0:15:43,67 --> 0:15:45,0
time, aerodynamically.


459
0:15:45,0 --> 0:15:49,48
McLaren, to catch up with
Porsche, for example, were


460
0:15:49,48 --> 0:15:51,76
running 8-liter,
9-liter motors.


461
0:15:51,76 --> 0:15:52,31
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


462
0:15:52,31 --> 0:15:53,1
LEO PARENTE: Anything went.


463
0:15:53,1 --> 0:15:53,71
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


464
0:15:53,71 --> 0:15:54,825
LEO PARENTE: If you could
build it within the box,


465
0:15:54,825 --> 0:15:56,27
freaking let it go.


466
0:15:56,27 --> 0:15:58,47
IAN WHELAN: I think you could
have something like that now.


467
0:15:58,47 --> 0:16:1,54
But maybe you just restrict the
amount of engines they can


468
0:16:1,54 --> 0:16:2,69
use per season.


469
0:16:2,69 --> 0:16:4,93
Let them run 21,000 rpms.


470
0:16:4,93 --> 0:16:5,81
I don't care.


471
0:16:5,81 --> 0:16:6,92
Let them put turbos.


472
0:16:6,92 --> 0:16:9,77
Let them run 12 cylinders
on the car.


473
0:16:9,77 --> 0:16:10,44
Anything goes.


474
0:16:10,44 --> 0:16:12,89
I want to see a mix of different
things from the


475
0:16:12,89 --> 0:16:15,82
manufacturers who
can profile--


476
0:16:15,82 --> 0:16:19,14
show off their own technology
in their different ways and


477
0:16:19,14 --> 0:16:20,65
say I know how to do
this better than


478
0:16:20,65 --> 0:16:21,63
you guys over there.


479
0:16:21,63 --> 0:16:25,64
LEO PARENTE: So to that point,
do you think WEC with the P1


480
0:16:25,64 --> 0:16:29,99
cars are close to that, or F1?


481
0:16:29,99 --> 0:16:33,76
IAN WHELAN: Well, the P1 cars
are cool to me, but there's


482
0:16:33,76 --> 0:16:36,5
still not enough of them.


483
0:16:36,5 --> 0:16:38,95
We need a whole field
of those cars.


484
0:16:38,95 --> 0:16:40,59
LEO PARENTE: So the problem's
going to be, not to be neg, is


485
0:16:40,59 --> 0:16:42,224
safety and budget.


486
0:16:42,224 --> 0:16:43,13
IAN WHELAN: Right.


487
0:16:43,13 --> 0:16:43,98
LEO PARENTE: But
that's where--


488
0:16:43,98 --> 0:16:45,92
IAN WHELAN: What's safety?


489
0:16:45,92 --> 0:16:48,31
LEO PARENTE: Well, to your point
much earlier, I don't


490
0:16:48,31 --> 0:16:50,27
think you can negate danger.


491
0:16:50,27 --> 0:16:51,78
You've got to make this
feel special.


492
0:16:51,78 --> 0:16:54,68
If anyone thinks they can just
jump in a car and act like


493
0:16:54,68 --> 0:16:57,28
they can drive with a sim,
then you've lost a


494
0:16:57,28 --> 0:16:59,59
bigger part of this.


495
0:16:59,59 --> 0:17:2,79
Slam any sports guy you want,
including Mr. PED.


496
0:17:2,79 --> 0:17:5,67
We know we can't do those
things, so we watch because


497
0:17:5,67 --> 0:17:6,63
they're gods.


498
0:17:6,63 --> 0:17:6,849
MAX SEEGER: Sure.


499
0:17:6,849 --> 0:17:9,31
LEO PARENTE: And from a race
car standpoint, if it's too


500
0:17:9,31 --> 0:17:11,71
easy to friggin' drive, besides
the fact that it's


501
0:17:11,71 --> 0:17:14,859
probably not appealing, the
drivers will tell you, it's


502
0:17:14,859 --> 0:17:16,41
too easy to frigging drive.


503
0:17:16,41 --> 0:17:17,94
And there's no allure there.


504
0:17:17,94 --> 0:17:18,72
MAX SEEGER: They'll
say that now?


505
0:17:18,72 --> 0:17:19,14
LEO PARENTE: Oh, yeah.


506
0:17:19,14 --> 0:17:19,56
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


507
0:17:19,56 --> 0:17:20,91
The WEC cars--


508
0:17:20,91 --> 0:17:23,95
I think they're really cool,
but they look like they're


509
0:17:23,95 --> 0:17:24,69
easy to drive.


510
0:17:24,69 --> 0:17:26,314
And I don't know if
they are, but--


511
0:17:26,314 --> 0:17:26,619
LEO PARENTE: Yeah.


512
0:17:26,619 --> 0:17:28,75
I'd have to ask Mich.


513
0:17:28,75 --> 0:17:29,94
IAN WHELAN: I don't know.


514
0:17:29,94 --> 0:17:31,1
From the outside, though--


515
0:17:31,1 --> 0:17:32,44
it goes back to what we were
talking about before.


516
0:17:32,44 --> 0:17:35,7
If you look at these spaceships
going down the road


517
0:17:35,7 --> 0:17:40,1
at ridiculous speeds, it just
seems completely undramatic.


518
0:17:40,1 --> 0:17:43,36
Whereas something like Can-Am,
everything looked like


519
0:17:43,36 --> 0:17:45,67
anything could happen
at any moment.


520
0:17:45,67 --> 0:17:48,3
LEO PARENTE: So his definition
of Can-Am, do you like that


521
0:17:48,3 --> 0:17:49,38
idea of having something
unlimited?


522
0:17:49,38 --> 0:17:52,9
MAX SEEGER: Yeah, that sounds
like-- because I think--


523
0:17:52,9 --> 0:17:55,79
more than like seeing
somebody get air or


524
0:17:55,79 --> 0:17:56,38
something like that.


525
0:17:56,38 --> 0:17:58,2
LEO PARENTE: Go ahead.


526
0:17:58,2 --> 0:17:59,18
MAX SEEGER: Because I
mean maybe that's a


527
0:17:59,18 --> 0:18:1,9
little low com denom.


528
0:18:1,9 --> 0:18:2,84
LEO PARENTE: WRC--


529
0:18:2,84 --> 0:18:3,6
rally--


530
0:18:3,6 --> 0:18:4,14
those cars fly.


531
0:18:4,14 --> 0:18:7,55
MAX SEEGER: But I am that,
because it spoke to me when


532
0:18:7,55 --> 0:18:9,19
that guy got air at
Race of Champions.


533
0:18:9,19 --> 0:18:16,12
But I think creativity, to see
people express themselves


534
0:18:16,12 --> 0:18:18,78
within racing would
be something that


535
0:18:18,78 --> 0:18:19,57
would appeal to me.


536
0:18:19,57 --> 0:18:21,69
IAN WHELAN: Well, that actually
brings up something.


537
0:18:21,69 --> 0:18:24,9
Like the old days of F1, when
you had these constructors who


538
0:18:24,9 --> 0:18:28,78
were building their own cars,
that was amazing.


539
0:18:28,78 --> 0:18:30,83
And there were so many different
things these guys


540
0:18:30,83 --> 0:18:32,8
were doing.


541
0:18:32,8 --> 0:18:33,96



542
0:18:33,96 --> 0:18:35,1
The things I said
about Can-Am--


543
0:18:35,1 --> 0:18:39,48
I want to see similar rules in
F1, like the old days where


544
0:18:39,48 --> 0:18:43,94
you had four cylinder cars going
up against V8s or V6s or


545
0:18:43,94 --> 0:18:45,85
whatever, or V12s.


546
0:18:45,85 --> 0:18:49,15
I know that probably with F1, if
you had that first season,


547
0:18:49,15 --> 0:18:51,2
you'd probably see the next
season, everyone would just


548
0:18:51,2 --> 0:18:53,38
figure out what happened, what
was the best way and they'd


549
0:18:53,38 --> 0:18:54,16
all go that way.


550
0:18:54,16 --> 0:18:54,87
LEO PARENTE: But that
happens anyway.


551
0:18:54,87 --> 0:18:55,51
IAN WHELAN: Right.


552
0:18:55,51 --> 0:18:57,15
LEO PARENTE: So actually, the
creativity, like you were


553
0:18:57,15 --> 0:18:59,98
talking about the F1, what my
mind thought of was "Time


554
0:18:59,98 --> 0:19:0,4
Attack."


555
0:19:0,4 --> 0:19:0,405
IAN WHELAN: Right.


556
0:19:0,405 --> 0:19:3,0
LEO PARENTE: All these kids love
"Time Attack," because


557
0:19:3,0 --> 0:19:3,72
they can be creative.


558
0:19:3,72 --> 0:19:5,58
They can build their own car.


559
0:19:5,58 --> 0:19:8,4
All the racing that I see,
even the amateur stuff,


560
0:19:8,4 --> 0:19:11,7
especially the pro, there's so
many rules and regulations and


561
0:19:11,7 --> 0:19:12,13
limitations.


562
0:19:12,13 --> 0:19:14,22
And to your point, once someone
comes up with a good


563
0:19:14,22 --> 0:19:16,92
idea, they all need to follow
that good idea, so everything


564
0:19:16,92 --> 0:19:17,58
looks alike.


565
0:19:17,58 --> 0:19:18,266
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


566
0:19:18,266 --> 0:19:20,9
LEO PARENTE: Here's what
I was thinking.


567
0:19:20,9 --> 0:19:23,35
North American racing only, we
probably should have a number


568
0:19:23,35 --> 0:19:27,51
of premier racing series to
satisfy all these various


569
0:19:27,51 --> 0:19:30,69
needs of action and whatever and
technology and tradition.


570
0:19:30,69 --> 0:19:32,73
And I'm going to throw this out,
and then we can kind of


571
0:19:32,73 --> 0:19:33,41
beat it to death.


572
0:19:33,41 --> 0:19:37,215
Everything below that is either
to learn the craft or


573
0:19:37,215 --> 0:19:42,16
is a feeder series and really
shouldn't distract from the


574
0:19:42,16 --> 0:19:43,42
specialness of this.


575
0:19:43,42 --> 0:19:45,66
So honestly, not all
this [BLEEP]


576
0:19:45,66 --> 0:19:47,4
should be on TV, because there's
too much clutter.


577
0:19:47,4 --> 0:19:48,93
So here's my short list.


578
0:19:48,93 --> 0:19:51,22
I think there needs to be a
premier open-wheel series in


579
0:19:51,22 --> 0:19:53,43
North America, Indy
Car evolved.


580
0:19:53,43 --> 0:19:58,12
I would it would be very high
tech, open spec, and be


581
0:19:58,12 --> 0:20:1,13
technologically related
to F1 so


582
0:20:1,13 --> 0:20:2,27
there can be some crossover.


583
0:20:2,27 --> 0:20:5,47
I'd even go so far as to suggest
the Indy 500 should be


584
0:20:5,47 --> 0:20:6,53
part of the F1 season.


585
0:20:6,53 --> 0:20:7,44
IAN WHELAN: It's like
the old days.


586
0:20:7,44 --> 0:20:7,93
LEO PARENTE: Like
the old days.


587
0:20:7,93 --> 0:20:11,73
IAN WHELAN: And the old Indy
cars actually were all


588
0:20:11,73 --> 0:20:13,75
different and high tech
for the time.


589
0:20:13,75 --> 0:20:14,933
They looked cool.


590
0:20:14,933 --> 0:20:15,76
LEO PARENTE: They
had turbines.


591
0:20:15,76 --> 0:20:16,36
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


592
0:20:16,36 --> 0:20:17,7
They had all kinds
of crazy stuff.


593
0:20:17,7 --> 0:20:20,63
And you had the F1 drivers
coming over and driving cars


594
0:20:20,63 --> 0:20:21,9
on a one-off basis.


595
0:20:21,9 --> 0:20:25,88
Or, like you said, it was
part of the whole world


596
0:20:25,88 --> 0:20:26,28
championship.


597
0:20:26,28 --> 0:20:27,58
LEO PARENTE: I'm not going to
get caught in the details.


598
0:20:27,58 --> 0:20:28,775
Somewhere along the line,
there should be


599
0:20:28,775 --> 0:20:30,22
a connect the dots.


600
0:20:30,22 --> 0:20:34,428
But Indy Car should be the
fastest cars in North America.


601
0:20:34,428 --> 0:20:35,72
IAN WHELAN: Right.


602
0:20:35,72 --> 0:20:37,28
Right now, I'm not interested
at all, because


603
0:20:37,28 --> 0:20:37,94
they're spec cars.


604
0:20:37,94 --> 0:20:40,24
LEO PARENTE: The next one is,
for me, there should be a


605
0:20:40,24 --> 0:20:43,0
premier production car
racing series.


606
0:20:43,0 --> 0:20:45,8
And that's got to be NASCAR.


607
0:20:45,8 --> 0:20:49,78
And I'm not sure it's all that
broke, having NASCAR.


608
0:20:49,78 --> 0:20:50,14
MAX SEEGER: OK.


609
0:20:50,14 --> 0:20:50,97
LEO PARENTE: What
do you think?


610
0:20:50,97 --> 0:20:55,56
MAX SEEGER: I don't really have
an opinion about NASCAR.


611
0:20:55,56 --> 0:20:57,22
LEO PARENTE: OK.


612
0:20:57,22 --> 0:20:58,93
MAX SEEGER: It's sort
of just there.


613
0:20:58,93 --> 0:20:59,225
LEO PARENTE: Yeah.


614
0:20:59,225 --> 0:20:59,52
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


615
0:20:59,52 --> 0:21:0,69
MAX SEEGER: Right?


616
0:21:0,69 --> 0:21:2,8
IAN WHELAN: I think they focus
too much on the wrong things


617
0:21:2,8 --> 0:21:6,9
in that series, but that's
a whole other discussion.


618
0:21:6,9 --> 0:21:8,2
MAX SEEGER: But maybe
I could--


619
0:21:8,2 --> 0:21:10,41
I didn't like broccoli
at a certain point.


620
0:21:10,41 --> 0:21:11,94
That's kids and all that.


621
0:21:11,94 --> 0:21:12,402
LEO PARENTE: Got it.


622
0:21:12,402 --> 0:21:13,326
I'm with you.


623
0:21:13,326 --> 0:21:13,79
I got it.


624
0:21:13,79 --> 0:21:14,44
IAN WHELAN: All right.


625
0:21:14,44 --> 0:21:16,3
I don't know if there's anything
that would really get


626
0:21:16,3 --> 0:21:17,58
me too excited about NASCAR.


627
0:21:17,58 --> 0:21:19,94
But I think at the very least,
if the cars were


628
0:21:19,94 --> 0:21:22,21
production-based like they
used to be in NASCAR--


629
0:21:22,21 --> 0:21:26,75
and if you don't have a
rear-wheel drive V8 car in


630
0:21:26,75 --> 0:21:30,4
your lineup, then you don't
get to race in NASCAR.


631
0:21:30,4 --> 0:21:31,69
You're going to fail.


632
0:21:31,69 --> 0:21:34,17
And if you want to homologate
cars like they used to do,


633
0:21:34,17 --> 0:21:35,3
that would be cool, at least.


634
0:21:35,3 --> 0:21:37,31
LEO PARENTE: Well, and then it
makes cool, special edition


635
0:21:37,31 --> 0:21:39,4
cars for sale to the public.


636
0:21:39,4 --> 0:21:39,87
IAN WHELAN: I love--


637
0:21:39,87 --> 0:21:40,125
exactly.


638
0:21:40,125 --> 0:21:42,22
And that could go across
all the boards,


639
0:21:42,22 --> 0:21:43,46
except maybe F1 cars.


640
0:21:43,46 --> 0:21:46,72
But I love the old days with
homologation specials and all


641
0:21:46,72 --> 0:21:49,62
this stuff with racing, because
it gives people a real


642
0:21:49,62 --> 0:21:51,35
connection with the race car.


643
0:21:51,35 --> 0:21:53,121
LEO PARENTE: So my
three were--


644
0:21:53,121 --> 0:21:54,356
MAX SEEGER: Just before you do
that, what is homologation?


645
0:21:54,356 --> 0:21:55,21
LEO PARENTE: Oh, OK.


646
0:21:55,21 --> 0:21:55,26
Sorry.


647
0:21:55,26 --> 0:21:55,72
Go ahead.


648
0:21:55,72 --> 0:21:55,97
IAN WHELAN: It's all right.


649
0:21:55,97 --> 0:21:59,8
Homologation is when there's a
requirement of, OK, you want


650
0:21:59,8 --> 0:22:2,4
to race this car,
this extra-fast,


651
0:22:2,4 --> 0:22:4,88
bigger-displacement monster?


652
0:22:4,88 --> 0:22:9,43
Well, then you have to build 500
or 5,000, whatever, street


653
0:22:9,43 --> 0:22:11,73
cars that the public can
actually buy to say, all


654
0:22:11,73 --> 0:22:13,38
right, this is a real car
that you make and you


655
0:22:13,38 --> 0:22:14,3
want to race it.


656
0:22:14,3 --> 0:22:19,45
LEO PARENTE: So the quick story
is back in '70, '69, the


657
0:22:19,45 --> 0:22:21,43
rules for Le Mans
racing changed.


658
0:22:21,43 --> 0:22:24,189
And the big engines were thrown
out the door, and they


659
0:22:24,189 --> 0:22:26,39
were going to have little
3-liter F1 engines.


660
0:22:26,39 --> 0:22:30,78
But you could raise a 5-liter
production car if you built--


661
0:22:30,78 --> 0:22:32,62
I think the number was 250.


662
0:22:32,62 --> 0:22:37,55
So Porsche literally built 200,
250 Porsche 917's, lined


663
0:22:37,55 --> 0:22:39,0
them all up, had the
sanctioning body


664
0:22:39,0 --> 0:22:40,46
come and see the cars.


665
0:22:40,46 --> 0:22:41,69
So Ferrari--


666
0:22:41,69 --> 0:22:43,22
holy [BLEEP], Porsche
has got a real


667
0:22:43,22 --> 0:22:44,73
race car at five liters.


668
0:22:44,73 --> 0:22:46,24
So Ferrari invited
everyone over.


669
0:22:46,24 --> 0:22:52,28
And the story is they built 100
of the cars, showed them


670
0:22:52,28 --> 0:22:54,85
the 100 cars, set the other
100 over here--


671
0:22:54,85 --> 0:22:56,28
let's go to lunch--


672
0:22:56,28 --> 0:22:59,24
moved the 100 cars to another
warehouse, and after lunch


673
0:22:59,24 --> 0:23:0,1
showed them the 100.


674
0:23:0,1 --> 0:23:0,98
And the guy said, oh, yeah.


675
0:23:0,98 --> 0:23:2,19
200-- you got it.


676
0:23:2,19 --> 0:23:2,77
OK, that's good.


677
0:23:2,77 --> 0:23:3,56
MAX SEEGER: Wow.


678
0:23:3,56 --> 0:23:4,94
LEO PARENTE: Homologation.


679
0:23:4,94 --> 0:23:5,86
Anyway, I digress.


680
0:23:5,86 --> 0:23:10,46
So more road racing for NASCAR,
I mean, honestly, if


681
0:23:10,46 --> 0:23:12,5
Australian V8 supercars have
shown us anything--


682
0:23:12,5 --> 0:23:13,7
IAN WHELAN: Right.


683
0:23:13,7 --> 0:23:16,95
That's a perfect example of
how NASCAR could succeed--


684
0:23:16,95 --> 0:23:19,72
and WTCC, another example.


685
0:23:19,72 --> 0:23:20,89
LEO PARENTE: And I bet you
when I babble that in the


686
0:23:20,89 --> 0:23:22,6
show, there'll be a ton of
commentators saying, yeah,


687
0:23:22,6 --> 0:23:23,24
yeah, yeah.


688
0:23:23,24 --> 0:23:27,45
In my less redneck Southern
drawl, I mean, stop making it


689
0:23:27,45 --> 0:23:28,73
this little--


690
0:23:28,73 --> 0:23:29,81
IAN WHELAN: Good
old boys thing.


691
0:23:29,81 --> 0:23:31,29
LEO PARENTE: In the Walmart
parking lot.


692
0:23:31,29 --> 0:23:34,516
IAN WHELAN: The whole heritage
connection with the


693
0:23:34,516 --> 0:23:36,84
moonshiners and stuff,
come on.


694
0:23:36,84 --> 0:23:38,55
It's been a really long time.


695
0:23:38,55 --> 0:23:41,61
There is real technology and
there is real advanced stuff


696
0:23:41,61 --> 0:23:42,74
going on in these things.


697
0:23:42,74 --> 0:23:43,335
Let's--


698
0:23:43,335 --> 0:23:43,72
LEO PARENTE: Bingo.


699
0:23:43,72 --> 0:23:45,4
IAN WHELAN: --bring it
up to modern day.


700
0:23:45,4 --> 0:23:45,538
LEO PARENTE: Yeah.


701
0:23:45,538 --> 0:23:48,3
Third series, I need sports
car road race.


702
0:23:48,3 --> 0:23:51,51
I think we need a GT class
that can be as


703
0:23:51,51 --> 0:23:52,75
open tech as it is.


704
0:23:52,75 --> 0:23:54,46
Everyone talks about
the Corvettes we


705
0:23:54,46 --> 0:23:56,54
see at these races.


706
0:23:56,54 --> 0:23:58,46
If they took the restrictors
off, how freaking


707
0:23:58,46 --> 0:23:58,89
fast would it be?


708
0:23:58,89 --> 0:24:0,4
IAN WHELAN: Oh, I'm fine with
that as long as it's actually


709
0:24:0,4 --> 0:24:1,91
based on a real chassis.


710
0:24:1,91 --> 0:24:2,91
LEO PARENTE: Bingo.


711
0:24:2,91 --> 0:24:5,25
And I can think if they want
tech in it, they can


712
0:24:5,25 --> 0:24:5,76
have tech in it.


713
0:24:5,76 --> 0:24:7,61
I think there should be
a prototype class, no


714
0:24:7,61 --> 0:24:8,43
offense to the F!


715
0:24:8,43 --> 0:24:8,91
cars.


716
0:24:8,91 --> 0:24:9,84
I know I'm talking
too much, but--


717
0:24:9,84 --> 0:24:10,28
MAX SEEGER: No, no.


718
0:24:10,28 --> 0:24:12,41
IAN WHELAN: No, I think it's
fine if there's prototypes,


719
0:24:12,41 --> 0:24:16,5
Can-Am style, that they're
almost like F1 cars with body


720
0:24:16,5 --> 0:24:17,24
work on them.


721
0:24:17,24 --> 0:24:18,71
LEO PARENTE: Now, I'm going
to drag you into this.


722
0:24:18,71 --> 0:24:19,4
MAX SEEGER: OK.


723
0:24:19,4 --> 0:24:21,35
LEO PARENTE: So all these road
racing cars, what would make


724
0:24:21,35 --> 0:24:24,27
road racing appealing to you?


725
0:24:24,27 --> 0:24:26,57
MAX SEEGER: I guess the thing
that would make it more


726
0:24:26,57 --> 0:24:29,35
relatable for me, if it was
in a place, like you said


727
0:24:29,35 --> 0:24:32,8
earlier, like San Francisco or
something like that, or just


728
0:24:32,8 --> 0:24:39,23
something that's tight, kind
of like a tighter race.


729
0:24:39,23 --> 0:24:41,38
LEO PARENTE: So what if
they had eliminations?


730
0:24:41,38 --> 0:24:45,94
What if it was literally every
weekend was a playoff, and it


731
0:24:45,94 --> 0:24:47,57
took all of the entrants
and cut it


732
0:24:47,57 --> 0:24:49,1
down to the two finalists?


733
0:24:49,1 --> 0:24:49,93
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


734
0:24:49,93 --> 0:24:52,7
LEO PARENTE: Would that
change your thinking?


735
0:24:52,7 --> 0:24:52,89
MAX SEEGER: I don't know.


736
0:24:52,89 --> 0:24:54,93
IAN WHELAN: I don't think the
manufacturers are going to


737
0:24:54,93 --> 0:24:56,3
like that too much.


738
0:24:56,3 --> 0:24:57,4
LEO PARENTE: It's our
Etch-a-Sketch.


739
0:24:57,4 --> 0:24:57,86
I don't know.


740
0:24:57,86 --> 0:25:0,335
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


741
0:25:0,335 --> 0:25:2,95
But then, by the end of the
year, you have what we have


742
0:25:2,95 --> 0:25:6,9
now with WEC, which is
two manufacturers--


743
0:25:6,9 --> 0:25:6,58
LEO PARENTE: No, no.


744
0:25:6,58 --> 0:25:7,46
I mean on the weekend.


745
0:25:7,46 --> 0:25:8,49
IAN WHELAN: Oh, OK.


746
0:25:8,49 --> 0:25:9,71
LEO PARENTE: 15 cars show
up in the field.


747
0:25:9,71 --> 0:25:10,66
IAN WHELAN: OK.


748
0:25:10,66 --> 0:25:12,35
LEO PARENTE: Instead of
qualifying, there are a


749
0:25:12,35 --> 0:25:14,91
certain number of elimination
races.


750
0:25:14,91 --> 0:25:17,77
And at the end of the day, maybe
that Sunday, you still


751
0:25:17,77 --> 0:25:19,36
have an elimination race
with everyone in it.


752
0:25:19,36 --> 0:25:21,776
But at the end of the day, we
take the two finalists and


753
0:25:21,776 --> 0:25:23,25
they go head to head,
somehow, some way.


754
0:25:23,25 --> 0:25:23,605
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


755
0:25:23,605 --> 0:25:23,96
IAN WHELAN: OK.


756
0:25:23,96 --> 0:25:25,48
LEO PARENTE: And I know
everyone's going to--


757
0:25:25,48 --> 0:25:27,1
MAX SEEGER: So this is two
and this is one on one?


758
0:25:27,1 --> 0:25:27,53
LEO PARENTE: Yeah.


759
0:25:27,53 --> 0:25:30,8
At the end of it, that's how
you'd stay interested, that


760
0:25:30,8 --> 0:25:32,84
you watch this bad version
of "American


761
0:25:32,84 --> 0:25:34,41
Idol" happen on a racetrack.


762
0:25:34,41 --> 0:25:36,55
MAX SEEGER: Well, I guess what
would be interesting, maybe,


763
0:25:36,55 --> 0:25:41,2
would be a back story of
the racers with a shot.


764
0:25:41,2 --> 0:25:47,39
Each one gets their lead
up to this race.


765
0:25:47,39 --> 0:25:48,432
IAN WHELAN: That's a--


766
0:25:48,432 --> 0:25:50,76
you mentioned "American Idol."
That's what they do for all


767
0:25:50,76 --> 0:25:51,245
these contestants.


768
0:25:51,245 --> 0:25:51,54
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


769
0:25:51,54 --> 0:25:53,52
IAN WHELAN: They have a back
story so you feel like you


770
0:25:53,52 --> 0:25:55,72
have a connection with these
people even though you've seen


771
0:25:55,72 --> 0:25:57,51
only a three-minute little
video about them.


772
0:25:57,51 --> 0:25:57,99
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


773
0:25:57,99 --> 0:26:0,74
LEO PARENTE: And NASCAR actually
tried to get there


774
0:26:0,74 --> 0:26:3,99
with this whole take the gloves
off the drivers and let


775
0:26:3,99 --> 0:26:6,555
them fight with each other and
have that type of conflict in


776
0:26:6,555 --> 0:26:6,69
personality.


777
0:26:6,69 --> 0:26:7,85
IAN WHELAN: That seems contrived
to me, though.


778
0:26:7,85 --> 0:26:8,77
LEO PARENTE: Thank you.


779
0:26:8,77 --> 0:26:9,18
OK.


780
0:26:9,18 --> 0:26:10,99
Because that's the other part--
somewhere in here,


781
0:26:10,99 --> 0:26:11,64
authenticity.


782
0:26:11,64 --> 0:26:12,43
IAN WHELAN: Right.


783
0:26:12,43 --> 0:26:13,38
LEO PARENTE: We're going
too long, and I


784
0:26:13,38 --> 0:26:14,42
apologize for this meeting.


785
0:26:14,42 --> 0:26:16,4
But the other thing
in sports car--


786
0:26:16,4 --> 0:26:20,21
I want a GT class that's just
the traditional, low-tech


787
0:26:20,21 --> 0:26:24,89
grunty cars without all the
driver controls and ABS and


788
0:26:24,89 --> 0:26:27,59
traction controls so that people
can get back to the


789
0:26:27,59 --> 0:26:31,956
roots and enjoy just a real
rough house-type race car.


790
0:26:31,956 --> 0:26:32,394
MAX SEEGER: OK.


791
0:26:32,394 --> 0:26:33,94
And what kind of track
is that on?


792
0:26:33,94 --> 0:26:34,7
IAN WHELAN: On a road course.


793
0:26:34,7 --> 0:26:36,68
LEO PARENTE: Road course.


794
0:26:36,68 --> 0:26:39,73
But to your point, we need to
have something that's rally,


795
0:26:39,73 --> 0:26:42,3
dirt, sliding, jumping.


796
0:26:42,3 --> 0:26:43,56
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


797
0:26:43,56 --> 0:26:46,7
I feel like I'm coming across
like this adrenaline junkie.


798
0:26:46,7 --> 0:26:47,16
LEO PARENTE: No, no.


799
0:26:47,16 --> 0:26:48,23
But you're not alone.


800
0:26:48,23 --> 0:26:49,53
IAN WHELAN: But you like what
you like, and that's why


801
0:26:49,53 --> 0:26:50,33
you're here.


802
0:26:50,33 --> 0:26:50,76
MAX SEEGER: Yeah, yeah.


803
0:26:50,76 --> 0:26:51,41
LEO PARENTE: Let me tell
you something.


804
0:26:51,41 --> 0:26:54,16
There is hundreds of millions
of dollars--


805
0:26:54,16 --> 0:26:54,87
a billion dollars--


806
0:26:54,87 --> 0:26:57,3
thrown at it, and Indy Car
will run a race on the


807
0:26:57,3 --> 0:26:58,93
weekend, and they'll get what?


808
0:26:58,93 --> 0:27:2,73
Maybe a million people
in the US, of 330


809
0:27:2,73 --> 0:27:4,15
million people, watching.


810
0:27:4,15 --> 0:27:4,53
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


811
0:27:4,53 --> 0:27:7,73
LEO PARENTE: So don't think
you're the exception.


812
0:27:7,73 --> 0:27:11,57
You're the friggin' norm with
the other 229,999 million.


813
0:27:11,57 --> 0:27:11,78
IAN WHELAN: Right.


814
0:27:11,78 --> 0:27:16,1
And in Europe, rally racing
is very popular.


815
0:27:16,1 --> 0:27:16,95
It's up there.


816
0:27:16,95 --> 0:27:18,395
It's up there with F1.


817
0:27:18,395 --> 0:27:21,32
I don't know the numbers, but
it's big compared to here.


818
0:27:21,32 --> 0:27:22,32
It's not so popular.


819
0:27:22,32 --> 0:27:22,39
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


820
0:27:22,39 --> 0:27:25,9
LEO PARENTE: So I know
there are rally


821
0:27:25,9 --> 0:27:27,1
events here in America.


822
0:27:27,1 --> 0:27:29,5
And I know the Global RallyCross
has done a pretty


823
0:27:29,5 --> 0:27:31,724
good job of getting
manufacturers engaged thanks


824
0:27:31,724 --> 0:27:33,68
to ESPN and X Game.


825
0:27:33,68 --> 0:27:35,47
But somewhere along the line,
with this dictatorship of all


826
0:27:35,47 --> 0:27:39,66
the OEMs running racing, they
just need to commit to have a


827
0:27:39,66 --> 0:27:42,9
bigger racing rally presence.


828
0:27:42,9 --> 0:27:44,14
And this goes back
to the media.


829
0:27:44,14 --> 0:27:48,33
Whether it's digital or TV, it
just needs to be out there so


830
0:27:48,33 --> 0:27:52,27
that people know these are the
special classes of racing that


831
0:27:52,27 --> 0:27:53,46
define racing.


832
0:27:53,46 --> 0:27:55,85
The last one-- something
for bikes.


833
0:27:55,85 --> 0:27:57,65
IAN WHELAN: I've
watched MotoGP.


834
0:27:57,65 --> 0:28:1,71
And the funny thing about that
is even though I love F1 and I


835
0:28:1,71 --> 0:28:4,65
like MotoGP, I think it's
actually more interesting when


836
0:28:4,65 --> 0:28:7,51
the bikes are more like World
Superbike, where they're a


837
0:28:7,51 --> 0:28:7,95
little bit--


838
0:28:7,95 --> 0:28:8,39
LEO PARENTE: Production based?


839
0:28:8,39 --> 0:28:9,43
IAN WHELAN: --more
production based.


840
0:28:9,43 --> 0:28:13,83
Because motorcycles, even the
regular road-based ones that


841
0:28:13,83 --> 0:28:16,33
you can buy at the dealership,
are so wild with the tech and


842
0:28:16,33 --> 0:28:19,99
stuff, you're already up
there in technology.


843
0:28:19,99 --> 0:28:25,3
So just to be able to actually
have a real connection seems


844
0:28:25,3 --> 0:28:26,7
even more important
in that case.


845
0:28:26,7 --> 0:28:28,52
LEO PARENTE: So we were
on the same page


846
0:28:28,52 --> 0:28:29,77
with production based.


847
0:28:29,77 --> 0:28:31,79
I was going to throw something
out there, and I don't


848
0:28:31,79 --> 0:28:33,79
understand why this is.


849
0:28:33,79 --> 0:28:36,72
Why can't I have a racing
weekend where there's car


850
0:28:36,72 --> 0:28:39,84
racing, and if the track allows
it-- and a lot of


851
0:28:39,84 --> 0:28:41,635
tracks do, like Laguna
Seca's--


852
0:28:41,635 --> 0:28:43,47
why don't they have
the weekend with


853
0:28:43,47 --> 0:28:44,86
bike being one event?


854
0:28:44,86 --> 0:28:45,78
IAN WHELAN: Yeah, why not?


855
0:28:45,78 --> 0:28:47,86
LEO PARENTE: And by the way,
have the cars go to a bike


856
0:28:47,86 --> 0:28:50,39
event and be a support
race to them.


857
0:28:50,39 --> 0:28:52,75
Are the fans all that different
that they don't--


858
0:28:52,75 --> 0:28:53,95
IAN WHELAN: No.


859
0:28:53,95 --> 0:28:57,88
I think there are, obviously,
support races already at


860
0:28:57,88 --> 0:28:59,59
different types of
race events.


861
0:28:59,59 --> 0:29:4,42
But if you had more top-level
racing at one event on one


862
0:29:4,42 --> 0:29:8,21
weekend, that could be pretty
interesting rather than the


863
0:29:8,21 --> 0:29:10,44
gentlemen drivers running
around in their Ferrari


864
0:29:10,44 --> 0:29:13,91
Scuderias and then the F1 cars
come out or whatever.


865
0:29:13,91 --> 0:29:16,84
LEO PARENTE: Does racing
include video games?


866
0:29:16,84 --> 0:29:20,17
Does this whole redesign
involved video games more than


867
0:29:20,17 --> 0:29:20,9
just having licensing?


868
0:29:20,9 --> 0:29:22,1
IAN WHELAN: I think it has to.


869
0:29:22,1 --> 0:29:25,17
I'm not a big video game fan,
but I think that it's


870
0:29:25,17 --> 0:29:28,71
important for the aspect
to bring new


871
0:29:28,71 --> 0:29:29,8
people into the sport.


872
0:29:29,8 --> 0:29:32,53
LEO PARENTE: Should I even
mention it in the show?


873
0:29:32,53 --> 0:29:33,74
IAN WHELAN: I think
you might have to.


874
0:29:33,74 --> 0:29:35,14
MAX SEEGER: Would this affect
video game sales?


875
0:29:35,14 --> 0:29:35,6
Or what are you saying?


876
0:29:35,6 --> 0:29:36,16
LEO PARENTE: No.


877
0:29:36,16 --> 0:29:40,19
Would I integrate video racing
into this redesign of what


878
0:29:40,19 --> 0:29:40,94
racing should be in
North America?


879
0:29:40,94 --> 0:29:41,6
MAX SEEGER: As a competition?


880
0:29:41,6 --> 0:29:42,52
LEO PARENTE: Yeah.


881
0:29:42,52 --> 0:29:47,66
IAN WHELAN: Or just to allow
the fans to play a sim of


882
0:29:47,66 --> 0:29:49,79
these different kinds
of racing so they


883
0:29:49,79 --> 0:29:51,31
can feel more involved.


884
0:29:51,31 --> 0:29:51,49
MAX SEEGER: Right.


885
0:29:51,49 --> 0:29:53,1
LEO PARENTE: And by the way, I
don't know how far it should


886
0:29:53,1 --> 0:29:56,18
go, because in Europe, and I
guess in a little bit of


887
0:29:56,18 --> 0:29:59,23
America, Nissan has their whole
GT Academy looking for


888
0:29:59,23 --> 0:30:2,845
young guys and girls to become
professional racers.


889
0:30:2,845 --> 0:30:3,41
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


890
0:30:3,41 --> 0:30:3,89
LEO PARENTE: Ordonez--


891
0:30:3,89 --> 0:30:6,145
if I'm pronouncing it right--
he's raced at Le Mans.


892
0:30:6,145 --> 0:30:7,52
He raced at Spa.


893
0:30:7,52 --> 0:30:10,87
Ford has their little online
version of Octane Academy,


894
0:30:10,87 --> 0:30:12,0
trying to find talent.


895
0:30:12,0 --> 0:30:13,35
I don't know what they're going
to do with them, but


896
0:30:13,35 --> 0:30:16,31
they've connected
the dots between


897
0:30:16,31 --> 0:30:18,1
virtual and real racing.


898
0:30:18,1 --> 0:30:18,7
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


899
0:30:18,7 --> 0:30:21,29
LEO PARENTE: And rather than
just sell more, how could


900
0:30:21,29 --> 0:30:25,48
racing use that to get
more fans into this?


901
0:30:25,48 --> 0:30:29,12
And perish the thought that you
have a competition where I


902
0:30:29,12 --> 0:30:33,84
get to race Vettel or Dale, Jr.
On the sim as part of some


903
0:30:33,84 --> 0:30:35,53
other version of "American
Idol" that keeps


904
0:30:35,53 --> 0:30:36,325
ringing in my head.


905
0:30:36,325 --> 0:30:38,15
MAX SEEGER: Hold
on, one second.


906
0:30:38,15 --> 0:30:38,725
Would it be possible--


907
0:30:38,725 --> 0:30:39,73
LEO PARENTE: Go ahead.


908
0:30:39,73 --> 0:30:41,91
MAX SEEGER: You have your guys
out there on the track.


909
0:30:41,91 --> 0:30:45,512
And then you have some kid in
a virtual car racing them at


910
0:30:45,512 --> 0:30:46,28
the same time.


911
0:30:46,28 --> 0:30:47,15
LEO PARENTE: I don't
see why not.


912
0:30:47,15 --> 0:30:48,625
Someone tried to do
that years ago.


913
0:30:48,625 --> 0:30:50,2
And they were way ahead
of the technology.


914
0:30:50,2 --> 0:30:50,81
MAX SEEGER: How would
that work?


915
0:30:50,81 --> 0:30:51,59
Yeah.


916
0:30:51,59 --> 0:30:55,58
IAN WHELAN: You're using the
video feed from the race or


917
0:30:55,58 --> 0:30:58,1
some sort of telemetry to
show where the cars are.


918
0:30:58,1 --> 0:31:0,33
But you're in the race as
well-- the real race.


919
0:31:0,33 --> 0:31:0,97
That would be cool.


920
0:31:0,97 --> 0:31:3,29
LEO PARENTE: It would never
interfere with the real race,


921
0:31:3,29 --> 0:31:6,67
and just have the sim respect
that if you bumped into one of


922
0:31:6,67 --> 0:31:8,45
the real cars, you bumped
into the car.


923
0:31:8,45 --> 0:31:8,907
IAN WHELAN: Right.


924
0:31:8,907 --> 0:31:9,821
MAX SEEGER: Right.


925
0:31:9,821 --> 0:31:11,2
IAN WHELAN: That would
be really cool.


926
0:31:11,2 --> 0:31:12,36
LEO PARENTE: Would you want--


927
0:31:12,36 --> 0:31:13,14
screw watching.


928
0:31:13,14 --> 0:31:14,31
Would you do that?


929
0:31:14,31 --> 0:31:15,72
MAX SEEGER: No, I
don't think so.


930
0:31:15,72 --> 0:31:17,13
[LAUGHTER]


931
0:31:17,13 --> 0:31:18,63
IAN WHELAN: But it sounds like
a good idea for people.


932
0:31:18,63 --> 0:31:18,96
LEO PARENTE: OK.


933
0:31:18,96 --> 0:31:21,49
Why did JF put you on the
"SHAKEDOWN" team?


934
0:31:21,49 --> 0:31:22,98
I'm kidding.


935
0:31:22,98 --> 0:31:24,92
The only one I haven't figured
out is drag racing.


936
0:31:24,92 --> 0:31:25,44
But guess what?


937
0:31:25,44 --> 0:31:28,16
The news is Ford cut
professional drag racing.


938
0:31:28,16 --> 0:31:29,61
They're dumping John Force.


939
0:31:29,61 --> 0:31:31,0
They're going to just
do grassroots.


940
0:31:31,0 --> 0:31:33,12
But I don't know what to do
about drag racing, and I


941
0:31:33,12 --> 0:31:34,39
can't ignore it.


942
0:31:34,39 --> 0:31:36,8
IAN WHELAN: Well, I don't
know enough about


943
0:31:36,8 --> 0:31:36,91
drag racing, but--


944
0:31:36,91 --> 0:31:37,68
LEO PARENTE: Nor
do I, I guess.


945
0:31:37,68 --> 0:31:40,66
IAN WHELAN: I think, again,
people have more connection to


946
0:31:40,66 --> 0:31:44,45
the cars that they can relate
to when they see a really--


947
0:31:44,45 --> 0:31:47,57
I'm thinking back to the
muscle car days.


948
0:31:47,57 --> 0:31:52,2
When they can see a car going
down the strip and then buy a


949
0:31:52,2 --> 0:31:55,22
car just like that, that's
pretty cool.


950
0:31:55,22 --> 0:31:56,89
So that's all I can
say about it.


951
0:31:56,89 --> 0:31:58,18
I know I'm repeating myself.


952
0:31:58,18 --> 0:31:58,435
MAX SEEGER: All right.


953
0:31:58,435 --> 0:32:1,62
How attended are drag races?


954
0:32:1,62 --> 0:32:2,78
IAN WHELAN: Professional ones?


955
0:32:2,78 --> 0:32:4,76
LEO PARENTE: I haven't been in
a long time, but I know the


956
0:32:4,76 --> 0:32:7,361
races on the West Coast,
they get a big crowd--


957
0:32:7,361 --> 0:32:7,832
100,000.


958
0:32:7,832 --> 0:32:8,303
MAX SEEGER: They do?


959
0:32:8,303 --> 0:32:8,774
Wow.


960
0:32:8,774 --> 0:32:9,245
IAN WHELAN: Wow.


961
0:32:9,245 --> 0:32:10,19
That's a lot.


962
0:32:10,19 --> 0:32:12,37
MAX SEEGER: So it doesn't seem
like there's a problem.


963
0:32:12,37 --> 0:32:12,88
LEO PARENTE: No, no.


964
0:32:12,88 --> 0:32:15,915
To that point, I don't think
there is a problem.


965
0:32:15,915 --> 0:32:18,41
They would argue differently
in terms of sponsorship and


966
0:32:18,41 --> 0:32:19,14
what's going on.


967
0:32:19,14 --> 0:32:21,83
But at the same point in time,
what I don't want to do is


968
0:32:21,83 --> 0:32:25,1
allow clutter to seep
back into this


969
0:32:25,1 --> 0:32:26,21
pushing racing forward.


970
0:32:26,21 --> 0:32:26,74
MAX SEEGER: Yeah.


971
0:32:26,74 --> 0:32:28,44
LEO PARENTE: But I'm the bad
guy who said, oh, yeah.


972
0:32:28,44 --> 0:32:29,7
Drag racing, forgot
about that.


973
0:32:29,7 --> 0:32:32,78
And I'm just throwing it
out there for them.


974
0:32:32,78 --> 0:32:34,2
I want to throw it out there
for the crowd when


975
0:32:34,2 --> 0:32:35,1
they talk about it.


976
0:32:35,1 --> 0:32:38,14
MAX SEEGER: Right now, as it is,
are there any events where


977
0:32:38,14 --> 0:32:40,77
they have this thing that you
were saying, where it's more


978
0:32:40,77 --> 0:32:43,77
like an Olympics kind of
thing, where if you're


979
0:32:43,77 --> 0:32:47,45
watching from home, you watch
the guy in the rings, and then


980
0:32:47,45 --> 0:32:48,42
it goes to--


981
0:32:48,42 --> 0:32:52,61
LEO PARENTE: I think the closest
are Race of Champions


982
0:32:52,61 --> 0:32:55,112
and the X Games.


983
0:32:55,112 --> 0:32:56,8
MAX SEEGER: OK


984
0:32:56,8 --> 0:32:56,19
LEO PARENTE: Yeah.


985
0:32:56,19 --> 0:32:57,88
MAX SEEGER: Do you like that?


986
0:32:57,88 --> 0:33:1,976
Do you think you'd stick around
for the whatever you


987
0:33:1,976 --> 0:33:4,15
don't like event?


988
0:33:4,15 --> 0:33:5,37
IAN WHELAN: Well, this
reminds me--


989
0:33:5,37 --> 0:33:6,15
not to cut you off.


990
0:33:6,15 --> 0:33:6,36
LEO PARENTE: Go ahead.


991
0:33:6,36 --> 0:33:7,25
No.


992
0:33:7,25 --> 0:33:8,59
Someone should.


993
0:33:8,59 --> 0:33:10,97
IAN WHELAN: With all these
different racing types within


994
0:33:10,97 --> 0:33:13,93
the sanctioning body, if we
could encourage the drivers to


995
0:33:13,93 --> 0:33:17,9
cross over more often, that
would be helpful, I think,


996
0:33:17,9 --> 0:33:20,89
because if you start following
a driver and you only like


997
0:33:20,89 --> 0:33:23,62
that one style of racing, you
might open your mind once he


998
0:33:23,62 --> 0:33:24,88
goes over to this other one.


999
0:33:24,88 --> 0:33:27,19
LEO PARENTE: I think that's
necessarily brilliant.


1000
0:33:27,19 --> 0:33:28,61
That has to happen.


1001
0:33:28,61 --> 0:33:30,74
IAN WHELAN: I feel like that
used to happen more often, not


1002
0:33:30,74 --> 0:33:32,39
under one sanctioning
body, but--


1003
0:33:32,39 --> 0:33:34,79
LEO PARENTE: Well, and to that
point, this is where I'm going


1004
0:33:34,79 --> 0:33:36,93
to put too much pressure
on the manufacturers.


1005
0:33:36,93 --> 0:33:41,34
But since they are being allowed
to run this thing,


1006
0:33:41,34 --> 0:33:42,275
look at Pat Long.


1007
0:33:42,275 --> 0:33:42,54
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


1008
0:33:42,54 --> 0:33:45,44
LEO PARENTE: They shopped Pat
Long around to various teams.


1009
0:33:45,44 --> 0:33:49,43
What we're saying is go back to
the old Andretti days, and


1010
0:33:49,43 --> 0:33:50,835
this weekend, you're
in the rally car.


1011
0:33:50,835 --> 0:33:51,15
IAN WHELAN: Right.


1012
0:33:51,15 --> 0:33:53,22
LEO PARENTE: Next weekend,
you're in our open-wheel car.


1013
0:33:53,22 --> 0:33:53,65
IAN WHELAN: Right.


1014
0:33:53,65 --> 0:33:54,51
LEO PARENTE: Whatever.


1015
0:33:54,51 --> 0:33:54,94
IAN WHELAN: Right.


1016
0:33:54,94 --> 0:33:56,43
LEO PARENTE: Yeah.


1017
0:33:56,43 --> 0:33:57,55
I think that would
interest you.


1018
0:33:57,55 --> 0:33:59,64
And it would build the
personality of these guys--


1019
0:33:59,64 --> 0:34:0,185
and girls.


1020
0:34:0,185 --> 0:34:1,38
I keep saying that.


1021
0:34:1,38 --> 0:34:2,82
IAN WHELAN: And it would show
how well rounded they are and


1022
0:34:2,82 --> 0:34:4,795
their strengths and all
that, weaknesses.


1023
0:34:4,795 --> 0:34:6,66
LEO PARENTE: And this week, I'm
watching rally, next week


1024
0:34:6,66 --> 0:34:10,159
I'm watching Indy, because
I'm following my guy.


1025
0:34:10,159 --> 0:34:11,159
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


1026
0:34:11,159 --> 0:34:13,54
MAX SEEGER: So are we done?


1027
0:34:13,54 --> 0:34:13,5
LEO PARENTE: Yeah.


1028
0:34:13,5 --> 0:34:14,719
Another five-minute
meeting with Leo.


1029
0:34:14,719 --> 0:34:15,44
Thanks.


1030
0:34:15,44 --> 0:34:15,37
IAN WHELAN: Yeah.


1031
0:34:15,37 --> 0:34:15,75
LEO PARENTE: No.


1032
0:34:15,75 --> 0:34:16,389
Yeah, I think we're done.


1033
0:34:16,389 --> 0:34:17,9
And I think you gave me
stuff to work on.


1034
0:34:17,9 --> 0:34:18,17
MAX SEEGER: Cool.


1035
0:34:18,17 --> 0:34:19,119
LEO PARENTE: So let me go
write this damn thing.


1036
0:34:19,119 --> 0:34:21,469
IAN WHELAN: All right.


1037
0:34:21,469 --> 0:34:23,719
LEO PARENTE: Today, on
"SHAKEDOWN," let's redo racing


1038
0:34:23,719 --> 0:34:26,659
and create the ideal North
American racing set, the


1039
0:34:26,659 --> 0:34:29,61
collection of racing series,
and race cars to get more


1040
0:34:29,61 --> 0:34:32,699
fans, to keep the hard-core
enthusiasts happy, and to


1041
0:34:32,699 --> 0:34:35,57
bring in new followers without
dumbing the racing down or


1042
0:34:35,57 --> 0:34:37,989
sensationalizing it into
some version of--


1043
0:34:37,989 --> 0:34:38,639
I don't know--


1044
0:34:38,639 --> 0:34:41,409
Ricky Bobby's Death Race 3000.


1045
0:34:41,409 --> 0:34:42,32
So why this show?


1046
0:34:42,32 --> 0:34:45,489
Well, frankly, I've had it with
the auto racing politics,


1047
0:34:45,489 --> 0:34:48,35
personal agendas, and
nearsighted compromises in


1048
0:34:48,35 --> 0:34:51,56
racing that never seem to get
us the best solutions or the


1049
0:34:51,56 --> 0:34:52,79
best racing.


1050
0:34:52,79 --> 0:34:55,32
And why a North American
racing redo versus


1051
0:34:55,32 --> 0:34:56,31
taking on the globe?


1052
0:34:56,31 --> 0:34:58,16
Well, I've got to
start somewhere.


1053
0:34:58,16 --> 0:35:2,44
This first, then we'll take on
F1 Bernie and/or the FIA.


1054
0:35:2,44 --> 0:35:5,25
So today, let's design a series
of North American


1055
0:35:5,25 --> 0:35:9,6
series with the cars, the
action, drivers, technology,


1056
0:35:9,6 --> 0:35:13,69
the traditions, the tracks, the
format of the racing, and


1057
0:35:13,69 --> 0:35:16,84
the media that would make racing
be what you want and


1058
0:35:16,84 --> 0:35:19,13
what more people would
want to follow.


1059
0:35:19,13 --> 0:35:21,37
And like every "SHAKEDOWN,"
we'll be doing our racing


1060
0:35:21,37 --> 0:35:23,86
redesign with your
ideas and input.


1061
0:35:23,86 --> 0:35:25,9
We're tipping the North
American auto racing


1062
0:35:25,9 --> 0:35:28,92
Etch-a-Sketch and turning the
knob "SHAKEDOWN" way, all with


1063
0:35:28,92 --> 0:35:29,58
your input.


1064
0:35:29,58 --> 0:35:33,44
So come back, and let's see if
we can out think the Indy Car


1065
0:35:33,44 --> 0:35:38,14
people, outsmart the SCCA, and
outfox the Frances of NASCAR


1066
0:35:38,14 --> 0:35:41,97
and the United Sports
Car Racing.
