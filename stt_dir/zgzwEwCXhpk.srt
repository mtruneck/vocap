0:0:17,22 --> 0:0:20,87
JOSH KALIS: I was living in
Frisco at this point in time,


3
0:0:20,87 --> 0:0:24,42
and my chick bounced.


4
0:0:24,42 --> 0:0:25,72
Went back to Michigan.


5
0:0:25,72 --> 0:0:27,71
And I'm following her.


6
0:0:27,71 --> 0:0:31,86
So I moved to Chicago from
Frisco, just to be a little


7
0:0:31,86 --> 0:0:35,19
closer, to see if I can
keep that fire going.


8
0:0:35,19 --> 0:0:40,11
And I said, hey, why don't
we go to Philly?


9
0:0:40,11 --> 0:0:40,75
She's like, all right.


10
0:0:40,75 --> 0:0:42,91
So her and her friend, we got
in a car and we drove to


11
0:0:42,91 --> 0:0:44,29
Philadelphia.


12
0:0:44,29 --> 0:0:48,59
Me and a couple dudes went
to go get some weed.


13
0:0:48,59 --> 0:0:50,72
And so I told her to
meet me at LOVE.


14
0:0:50,72 --> 0:0:53,95
And when we got back to LOVE,
her and her friend were like,


15
0:0:53,95 --> 0:0:54,61
bugged out.


16
0:0:54,61 --> 0:0:56,29
We were like, what's going on?


17
0:0:56,29 --> 0:0:57,65
She's like, you see those
fucking guys over there?


18
0:0:57,65 --> 0:1:0,27
And there was like seven
or eight dudes.


19
0:1:0,27 --> 0:1:2,35
She's like, yeah, they were
fucking pulling their dicks


20
0:1:2,35 --> 0:1:4,6
out and giving us a hard time.


21
0:1:4,6 --> 0:1:5,269
Her and her girlfriend.


22
0:1:5,269 --> 0:1:7,1
So Stevie was like,
what dudes?


23
0:1:7,1 --> 0:1:8,66
STEVIE WILLIAMS: I had a lot of
homies that would rob a lot


24
0:1:8,66 --> 0:1:11,18
of people that came
to LOVE Park.


25
0:1:11,18 --> 0:1:14,13
So we chilling at LOVE Park one
day, and my man was about


26
0:1:14,13 --> 0:1:15,315
to rob Josh.


27
0:1:15,315 --> 0:1:17,17
And I was like, no, no,
he cool, he cool.


28
0:1:17,17 --> 0:1:18,7
Don't worry about him.


29
0:1:18,7 --> 0:1:18,67
He good.


30
0:1:18,67 --> 0:1:21,2
When Josh came over
and sat down, I


31
0:1:21,2 --> 0:1:22,1
introduced him to everybody.


32
0:1:22,1 --> 0:1:24,38
He was like, damn, where
is everybody at?


33
0:1:24,38 --> 0:1:25,96
I"m like, no, this
is our park now.


34
0:1:25,96 --> 0:1:27,65
JOSH KALIS: The dudes had knives
in their backpack, and


35
0:1:27,65 --> 0:1:29,85
Stevie and them fucking took
their knives off them, and


36
0:1:29,85 --> 0:1:31,56
like, get the fuck
out of here.


37
0:1:31,56 --> 0:1:35,23
So Olivia saw that,
like, brotherhood.


38
0:1:35,23 --> 0:1:35,77
You know what I mean?


39
0:1:35,77 --> 0:1:38,54
She was like, damn, these
are your dogs, man.


40
0:1:38,54 --> 0:1:40,865
I'm like, yeah, I'm
down to move back.


41
0:1:40,865 --> 0:1:44,31
INTERVIEWER: And your daughter
is with her?


42
0:1:44,31 --> 0:1:44,72
JOSH KALIS: Yes.


43
0:1:44,72 --> 0:1:47,303
Yeah, that's my baby mama.


44
0:1:47,303 --> 0:1:48,205
Hey.


45
0:1:48,205 --> 0:1:48,66
Mommy.


46
0:1:48,66 --> 0:1:50,558
Mommy and daughter,
right there.

52
0:2:0,29 --> 0:2:3,8
Yeah.


53
0:2:3,8 --> 0:2:4,55
BILL STROBECK: He
was a good dad.


54
0:2:4,55 --> 0:2:6,17
They lived up the street
from LOVE.


55
0:2:6,17 --> 0:2:7,97
They lived like six,
seven blocks away.


56
0:2:7,97 --> 0:2:13,84
So Olivia would come down with
Jaelen every now and then.


57
0:2:13,84 --> 0:2:16,418
There's tons of footage
of her down there.


58

OLIVIA: [COOING].

RYAN GEE: Of course, brings
her right to LOVE.


61
0:2:23,52 --> 0:2:26,82
She was probably like a few
months old here, if that, and


62
0:2:26,82 --> 0:2:30,7
now she's like 11, now.


63
0:2:30,7 --> 0:2:31,86
So I think she was
born in '99.


64
0:2:31,86 --> 0:2:34,745
JOSH KALIS: She fell in love
with it because I fell


65
0:2:34,745 --> 0:2:35,73
in love with it.


66
0:2:35,73 --> 0:2:39,9
I mean, I used to skate Philly
before then, but this time it


67
0:2:39,9 --> 0:2:42,17
was like, wow.


68
0:2:42,17 --> 0:2:45,3
I mean, not very many
people are skating.


69
0:2:45,3 --> 0:2:48,3
I ran into Stevie, who was like
fucked up in a bus stop.


70
0:2:48,3 --> 0:2:50,66
And I was like, man, this
is where I want to be.


71
0:2:50,66 --> 0:2:52,74
STEVIE WILLIAMS: I was in the
train station, drinking a 40


72
0:2:52,74 --> 0:2:54,69
with my man on the corner.


73
0:2:54,69 --> 0:2:59,17
And Josh pops up, like
basically, yo, I got a


74
0:2:59,17 --> 0:3:0,1
apartment here.


75
0:3:0,1 --> 0:3:1,84
I want you to live with me.


76
0:3:1,84 --> 0:3:4,56
I'm like, yeah, right.


77
0:3:4,56 --> 0:3:6,5
But he was serious.


78
0:3:6,5 --> 0:3:8,683
He was like, damn, I wish you
skated a little bit more.


79
0:3:8,683 --> 0:3:10,5
And I was like, I don't.


80
0:3:10,5 --> 0:3:11,63
I'm here every day.


81
0:3:11,63 --> 0:3:14,0
But I don't skate
no more, really.

already quit Profile

0:3:15,24 --> 0:3:15,89

0:3:15,89 --> 0:3:17,27
STEVIE WILLIAMS: I
have shit, yo.


85
0:3:17,27 --> 0:3:17,91
I quit everything.


86
0:3:17,91 --> 0:3:18,29
INTERVIEWER: So you quit--


87
0:3:18,29 --> 0:3:18,93
STEVIE WILLIAMS: No,
I got kicked


88
0:3:18,93 --> 0:3:20,32
off everything, basically.


89
0:3:20,32 --> 0:3:21,44
'Cause I was wildin'.


90
0:3:21,44 --> 0:3:25,33
I was just some street nigga
that just didn't really take


91
0:3:25,33 --> 0:3:27,17
my skill serious.


92
0:3:27,17 --> 0:3:29,29
And it took Josh to
like, smack me in


93
0:3:29,29 --> 0:3:30,67
the head, like, yo.


94
0:3:30,67 --> 0:3:31,71
And I'm staying with him.


95
0:3:31,71 --> 0:3:35,516
He getting big-ass boxes
of DCs and free shit.


96
0:3:35,516 --> 0:3:36,8
He got all this money.


97
0:3:36,8 --> 0:3:39,29
Every time I turn around
he's buying a new car.


98
0:3:39,29 --> 0:3:41,26
And I didn't even
have a license.


99
0:3:41,26 --> 0:3:41,99
And he knew that.


100
0:3:41,99 --> 0:3:45,95
But he just wanted to make sure
that I was situated and I


101
0:3:45,95 --> 0:3:48,55
maximized the potential
that I had.


102
0:3:48,55 --> 0:3:49,44
That's why I love him.


103
0:3:49,44 --> 0:3:53,14
That's my heart right there.


104
0:3:53,14 --> 0:3:56,46

yeah, Stevie.


105
0:3:56,46 --> 0:3:57,918
Go, go, go.


106
0:3:57,918 --> 0:4:1,3
STEVIE WILLIAMS: And he helped
me get back skating by


107
0:4:1,3 --> 0:4:2,98
battling me.


108
0:4:2,98 --> 0:4:6,43
And like I said, it's somebody
that knows you that can pull


109
0:4:6,43 --> 0:4:9,34
your skill out of you and
actually see you shine.


110
0:4:9,34 --> 0:4:13,48
And I give Josh a lot
of credit for the


111
0:4:13,48 --> 0:4:15,46
rebirth of my career.


112
0:4:15,46 --> 0:4:17,69
JIMMY GORECKI: Growing up there,
that's who any kid in


113
0:4:17,69 --> 0:4:20,29
that area looked up to,
you know what I mean?


114
0:4:20,29 --> 0:4:22,66
Like I would go skating
and I wouldn't have


115
0:4:22,66 --> 0:4:24,42
any laces in my shoes.


116
0:4:24,42 --> 0:4:27,47
And tongues would be out,
and we were all--


117
0:4:27,47 --> 0:4:29,3
anybody that's there that was
from that area and that said


118
0:4:29,3 --> 0:4:31,39
they weren't a huge Stevie
Williams fan


119
0:4:31,39 --> 0:4:33,2
is a goddamn liar.


120
0:4:33,2 --> 0:4:34,742
And he was so Philadelphia.


121
0:4:34,742 --> 0:4:36,92
You know what I mean?


122
0:4:36,92 --> 0:4:40,19
You could see it just pouring
out of him, you know?


123
0:4:40,19 --> 0:4:42,58
RB UMALI: Oh, Josh at LOVE Park
and Stevie at LOVE Park?


124
0:4:42,58 --> 0:4:43,2
Yeah, those are the days.


125
0:4:43,2 --> 0:4:45,97
I remember, like, rolling up
with Josh and being cool with


126
0:4:45,97 --> 0:4:48,84
Stevie right away, and like--
yeah, seeing that whole era go


127
0:4:48,84 --> 0:4:52,17
down was definitely one
of the best scenes in


128
0:4:52,17 --> 0:4:52,84
skateboarding ever.


129
0:4:52,84 --> 0:4:56,2
Just like, plaza in the city,
locals everywhere,


130
0:4:56,2 --> 0:4:57,21
super fun to skate.


131
0:4:57,21 --> 0:4:59,3
Like the best stuff you
can imagine to skate.


132
0:4:59,3 --> 0:5:1,75
And these two kids
just ruling it.


133
0:5:1,75 --> 0:5:10,65



134
0:5:10,65 --> 0:5:13,72
RICKY OYOLA: You know, that was
right around the time my


135
0:5:13,72 --> 0:5:14,56
back was out.


136
0:5:14,56 --> 0:5:16,95
I couldn't skate for
a long time.


137
0:5:16,95 --> 0:5:21,53
And that's when those two
started blowing up LOVE on


138
0:5:21,53 --> 0:5:22,83
their level.


139
0:5:22,83 --> 0:5:24,235
It was around that
time period.


140
0:5:24,235 --> 0:5:27,9



141
0:5:27,9 --> 0:5:29,6
JIMMY GORECKI: After the Eastern
Exposure, Ricky's


142
0:5:29,6 --> 0:5:33,13
movement and that whole crew of
people, it was fading out.


143
0:5:33,13 --> 0:5:36,0
And then Josh just revamped
the whole


144
0:5:36,0 --> 0:5:38,15
thing, him and Stevie.


145
0:5:38,15 --> 0:5:41,5
And then that brought more light
to the O'Connors and the


146
0:5:41,5 --> 0:5:44,33
Pluhowskis and the Pappalardos
and Wennings and stuff.


147
0:5:44,33 --> 0:5:47,1
He really brought together
this movement.


148
0:5:47,1 --> 0:5:48,46
They were all teammates,
whether it


149
0:5:48,46 --> 0:5:49,96
was DC or the Workshop.


150
0:5:49,96 --> 0:5:52,53
And Josh was always just so
prominent there, you know?


151
0:5:52,53 --> 0:5:55,96
It was always filming something
super hard.


152
0:5:55,96 --> 0:5:58,2
Always just--


153
0:5:58,2 --> 0:5:58,86
he was killing it, man.


154
0:5:58,86 --> 0:6:1,47
Dude skated really fast and did
really hard tricks and was


155
0:6:1,47 --> 0:6:2,72
super unique.


156
0:6:2,72 --> 0:6:5,2



157
0:6:5,2 --> 0:6:6,73
And it was always super
consistent, you know?


158
0:6:6,73 --> 0:6:8,84
The same way he skates now
is just as hard as he


159
0:6:8,84 --> 0:6:10,64
shredded back then.


160
0:6:10,64 --> 0:6:16,5



161
0:6:16,5 --> 0:6:18,67
At the time there wasn't a
skateboarder or pro at the


162
0:6:18,67 --> 0:6:22,31
time that me, being like a
little hip-hop honky, was more


163
0:6:22,31 --> 0:6:25,4
identifiable with than
Josh Kalis, you know?


164
0:6:25,4 --> 0:6:29,15
The raddest thing was, there
wasn't a kid that came


165
0:6:29,15 --> 0:6:34,2
downtown that didn't have some
DCs on with swooshy pants and


166
0:6:34,2 --> 0:6:37,77
a fucking DC jersey or
a Workshop t-shirt.


167
0:6:37,77 --> 0:6:40,57
Every kid, you know?


168
0:6:40,57 --> 0:6:43,37
BILL STROBECK: It turned into
a thing when Josh started


169
0:6:43,37 --> 0:6:47,14
skating real hard and wanted
to film all the time, take


170
0:6:47,14 --> 0:6:48,49
photos all the time.


171
0:6:48,49 --> 0:6:51,11
And then a lot of people started
wanting to come to--


172
0:6:51,11 --> 0:6:53,18
a lot of people wanted
to come to Philly.


173
0:6:53,18 --> 0:6:54,76
There was just so many people.


174
0:6:54,76 --> 0:6:59,53
It went from not many at all to
so many that it was like, I


175
0:6:59,53 --> 0:7:1,57
was filming all day long
and then go out


176
0:7:1,57 --> 0:7:2,71
at night with Generate.


177
0:7:2,71 --> 0:7:3,3
But I wanted to.


178
0:7:3,3 --> 0:7:5,86
I liked it.


179
0:7:5,86 --> 0:7:7,24
Everyone wanted to do it.


180
0:7:7,24 --> 0:7:10,5
We knew that something was going
on, and we wanted to


181
0:7:10,5 --> 0:7:10,68
keep it going.


182
0:7:10,68 --> 0:7:12,592
And we wanted to
make it bigger.


183
0:7:12,592 --> 0:7:14,922
JOSH KALIS: Come on,
put the board on.


184
0:7:14,922 --> 0:7:15,854
BRIAN WENNING: You gotta
give me shit?


185
0:7:15,854 --> 0:7:16,6
You broke--


186
0:7:16,6 --> 0:7:19,29
JOSH KALIS: This is Brian
Wenning, a new am.


187
0:7:19,29 --> 0:7:21,2
How many boards you got
at the house, Brian?


188
0:7:21,2 --> 0:7:21,8
BRIAN WENNING: Zero.


189
0:7:21,8 --> 0:7:22,57
JOSH KALIS: You got some.


190
0:7:22,57 --> 0:7:23,342
BRIAN WENNING: Three.


191
0:7:23,342 --> 0:7:25,12
JOSH KALIS: He's got three--


192
0:7:25,12 --> 0:7:27,291
he sat on three boards.


193
0:7:27,291 --> 0:7:28,833
Welcome to the team.


194

can never break the


196

board when he tries--


197
0:7:38,493 --> 0:7:41,89
MALE SPEAKER: That
was so good.


198
0:7:41,89 --> 0:7:45,9
JOSH KALIS: I looked like a
sucker 'cause I fucked up.


199
0:7:45,9 --> 0:7:47,66
But I'ma get 'em, though.


200
0:7:47,66 --> 0:7:49,97
BILL STROBECK: Brian and Anthony
were here every day


201
0:7:49,97 --> 0:7:50,63
doing stuff.


202
0:7:50,63 --> 0:7:52,37
So I was like--


203
0:7:52,37 --> 0:7:53,68
everyone was doing stuff.


204
0:7:53,68 --> 0:7:56,99
If I wasn't filming somebody
do something here, I was


205
0:7:56,99 --> 0:7:58,4
filming somebody do something
over there.


206
0:7:58,4 --> 0:8:0,11
I was here every single day.


207
0:8:0,11 --> 0:8:1,96
Every single day.


208
0:8:1,96 --> 0:8:5,0
Skate down here and I would just
hang out with everyone.


209
0:8:5,0 --> 0:8:6,27
It was wild.


210
0:8:6,27 --> 0:8:9,56
There was a lot of people that
were there that no one will


211
0:8:9,56 --> 0:8:11,42
ever know, that were
like the staples.


212
0:8:11,42 --> 0:8:14,915
MAN IN PARK: I'd rather see them
skateboards than running


213
0:8:14,915 --> 0:8:16,88
around trying to stab somebody,
trying to take


214
0:8:16,88 --> 0:8:18,1
something from somebody.


215
0:8:18,1 --> 0:8:20,1
BILL STROBECK: There's a whole
cast of characters that made


216
0:8:20,1 --> 0:8:21,14
up that place.


217
0:8:21,14 --> 0:8:22,49
MAN IN PARK: Beatnik.


218
0:8:22,49 --> 0:8:23,39
Hey, man.


219
0:8:23,39 --> 0:8:24,25
I used to skate.


220
0:8:24,25 --> 0:8:26,205
You remember, you used
to see me out here.


221
0:8:26,205 --> 0:8:27,7
I used to skate hard
as shit before.


222
0:8:27,7 --> 0:8:29,34
That's when I know--


223
0:8:29,34 --> 0:8:30,28
I used to do acid.


224
0:8:30,28 --> 0:8:31,455
Hey, look.


225
0:8:31,455 --> 0:8:34,295
Hey, was you out here when
I tried to 5-0 that?


226
0:8:34,295 --> 0:8:36,8
I swear I had that
shit swarking.


227
0:8:36,8 --> 0:8:37,89
I could never land it.


228
0:8:37,89 --> 0:8:39,549
BILL STROBECK: Like you've seen
Stevie and Josh, and all


229
0:8:39,549 --> 0:8:39,95
these guys.


230
0:8:39,95 --> 0:8:44,53
There was a crew of hoodlums
and there was a crew of--


231
0:8:44,53 --> 0:8:45,41
RYAN GEE: Derelicts.


232
0:8:45,41 --> 0:8:48,8
BILL STROBECK: Like
bums that bone.


233
0:8:48,8 --> 0:8:50,35
And there was also the
cops were part of it.


234
0:8:50,35 --> 0:8:51,51
And we--


235
0:8:51,51 --> 0:8:53,59
Josh knew all the undercovers.


236
0:8:53,59 --> 0:8:55,47
He was so boys with them.


237
0:8:55,47 --> 0:8:57,5
He would give them his shoes--


238
0:8:57,5 --> 0:8:57,805
RYAN GEE: He would
give them shoes.


239
0:8:57,805 --> 0:8:59,2
POLICE ON LOUDSPEAKER: This is
the Philadelphia Police.


240
0:8:59,2 --> 0:9:0,595
Leave the area immediately.


241
0:9:0,595 --> 0:9:1,525
Leave the area immediately.


242
0:9:1,525 --> 0:9:3,85
Get out of here,
skateboarders.


243
0:9:3,85 --> 0:9:5,55
JIMMY GORECKI: You would hear
stories like, Josh ran into


244
0:9:5,55 --> 0:9:8,2
the undercovers on South Street
and he went and took


245
0:9:8,2 --> 0:9:10,94
them all to Elite and put DCs
on all of their feet.


246
0:9:10,94 --> 0:9:12,73
So they would run in
and he'd be, like--


247
0:9:12,73 --> 0:9:14,52
I remember sitting there one
day, like, why is this guy not


248
0:9:14,52 --> 0:9:15,24
even running?


249
0:9:15,24 --> 0:9:17,74
I'm freaking out, like
here he had all the


250
0:9:17,74 --> 0:9:18,93
undercovers in his pocket.


251
0:9:18,93 --> 0:9:21,62
They all had his shoes on.


252
0:9:21,62 --> 0:9:24,55
RYAN GEE: These are the
shoes I skated in


253
0:9:24,55 --> 0:9:26,92
with Chomp On This.


254
0:9:26,92 --> 0:9:29,23
So-- remember these?


255
0:9:29,23 --> 0:9:31,42
I was just so proud of
that video part.


256
0:9:31,42 --> 0:9:33,15
I'm like, dude, I'm going
to keep these shoes.


257
0:9:33,15 --> 0:9:35,99
Like Josh's shoes are so sick.


258
0:9:35,99 --> 0:9:38,48
I think these were Stevie's.


259
0:9:38,48 --> 0:9:40,72
STEVIE WILLIAMS: That was that
arrow, the Josh and Stevie.


260
0:9:40,72 --> 0:9:43,66
It was a black/white combo.


261
0:9:43,66 --> 0:9:46,3
Everybody know he looked
out for me.


262
0:9:46,3 --> 0:9:49,65
And me and him had
DC, that made us,


263
0:9:49,65 --> 0:9:52,26
put us on that pedestal.


264
0:9:52,26 --> 0:9:55,4
MIKE BLABAC: This is right when
Kalis and Stevie were


265
0:9:55,4 --> 0:9:57,67
both getting their
shoes out for DC.


266
0:9:57,67 --> 0:10:1,192
And so at the time, they both
lived in Philly, so I


267
0:10:1,192 --> 0:10:2,37
would go out there.


268
0:10:2,37 --> 0:10:5,8
In '99 and 2000, pretty much
the whole summer I


269
0:10:5,8 --> 0:10:6,89
spent at LOVE Park.


270
0:10:6,89 --> 0:10:9,83
So this is just a photo from
the first summer I really


271
0:10:9,83 --> 0:10:12,55
spent a lot of time out
there, was in '99.


272
0:10:12,55 --> 0:10:15,19
JOSH KALIS: Should we
go to LOVE Park?


273
0:10:15,19 --> 0:10:18,86
BILL STROBECK: And the thing
is, Josh and Stevie, they


274
0:10:18,86 --> 0:10:22,17
combined their skill with that
symbol and made something I


275
0:10:22,17 --> 0:10:25,37
don't think I'll ever see again
in skating, for a long


276
0:10:25,37 --> 0:10:26,61
time at least.


277
0:10:26,61 --> 0:10:27,69
But like, it was everything.


278
0:10:27,69 --> 0:10:29,77
It was like the board had
the LOVE sign on it.


279
0:10:29,77 --> 0:10:31,245
And then there was a photo
with everyone in


280
0:10:31,245 --> 0:10:31,93
front of the LOVE sign.


281
0:10:31,93 --> 0:10:35,22
It's like, you do that, and then
people from all over the


282
0:10:35,22 --> 0:10:37,26
world-- all of a sudden,
people from Germany are


283
0:10:37,26 --> 0:10:39,66
showing up to skate there,
from all over.


284
0:10:39,66 --> 0:10:42,6
It was like an attractive
spot.


285
0:10:42,6 --> 0:10:44,22
JIMMY GORECKI: And at that time,
I was going to New York


286
0:10:44,22 --> 0:10:47,57
every weekend to skate with
RB, because the weekend


287
0:10:47,57 --> 0:10:50,9
warriors would come to LOVE and
it'd be a hundred kids.


288
0:10:50,9 --> 0:10:53,42



289
0:10:53,42 --> 0:10:55,92
RB UMALI: Came to visit me in
New York one time, and I


290
0:10:55,92 --> 0:10:57,54
remember people were like
clowning me for


291
0:10:57,54 --> 0:10:58,39
meeting up with Josh.


292
0:10:58,39 --> 0:10:59,493
Like, why are you filming
him, man?


293
0:10:59,493 --> 0:11:1,405
You should be filming the
guys from New York.


294
0:11:1,405 --> 0:11:2,32
I'm like, dude, that's Josh.


295
0:11:2,32 --> 0:11:3,17
He's my boy from Texas.


296
0:11:3,17 --> 0:11:4,92
I'm gonna film him.


297
0:11:4,92 --> 0:11:6,8
It was really easy to
film with Josh.


298
0:11:6,8 --> 0:11:10,44
He always just did something
good and never really took


299
0:11:10,44 --> 0:11:12,6
that long of a time
for me, you know?


300
0:11:12,6 --> 0:11:14,85
Because I was used to filming
certain skaters for a long


301
0:11:14,85 --> 0:11:16,54
time, like lucky to get--


302
0:11:16,54 --> 0:11:19,15
going back every day for a trick
and luckily getting like


303
0:11:19,15 --> 0:11:20,8
one trick a week
with this guy.


304
0:11:20,8 --> 0:11:21,88
But with Josh, it was
super organic.


305
0:11:21,88 --> 0:11:24,11
We'd just go to a spot and be
like oh, I'm gonna try this.


306
0:11:24,11 --> 0:11:24,61
I gonna try that.


307
0:11:24,61 --> 0:11:26,716
And it always came out dope.


308
0:11:26,716 --> 0:11:28,31
And then I think--


309
0:11:28,31 --> 0:11:31,27
I don't know if it was in
Heads or if it was in--


310
0:11:31,27 --> 0:11:34,45
I think it might have been
in Photosynthesis, maybe.


311
0:11:34,45 --> 0:11:36,67
But he did a line at
Newport with just a


312
0:11:36,67 --> 0:11:37,78
fakie flip on flat.


313
0:11:37,78 --> 0:11:40,29
And I just remember this fakie
flip he did on flat was--


314
0:11:40,29 --> 0:11:41,96
I was like, yeah, that's
how you fakie flip.


315
0:11:41,96 --> 0:11:43,72
You gotta fakie flip
like you mean it.


316
0:11:43,72 --> 0:11:46,87
BILL STROBECK: This one time
I went to Josh's--


317
0:11:46,87 --> 0:11:50,57
I went to his mother's house
out in-- where is it out in


318
0:11:50,57 --> 0:11:50,865
Pennsylvania?


319
0:11:50,865 --> 0:11:51,16
Is it in Pennsylvania?


320
0:11:51,16 --> 0:11:53,8
RYAN GEE: Yeah, near
Sesame Place, or--


321
0:11:53,8 --> 0:11:58,1
BILL STROBECK: I went out there,
and he was skating on--


322
0:11:58,1 --> 0:12:0,77
he had a board on
a trampoline.


323
0:12:0,77 --> 0:12:1,74
Have you ever seen
him do that?


324
0:12:1,74 --> 0:12:2,8
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, yeah.


325
0:12:2,8 --> 0:12:2,42
That trampoline.


326
0:12:2,42 --> 0:12:4,17
BILL STROBECK: Have you have
ever seen him do the board on


327
0:12:4,17 --> 0:12:4,5
the trampoline?


328
0:12:4,5 --> 0:12:4,81
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.


329
0:12:4,81 --> 0:12:5,295
Yeah.


330
0:12:5,295 --> 0:12:6,4
BILL STROBECK: It's psycho.


331
0:12:6,4 --> 0:12:9,76
He can do every trick
variation.


332
0:12:9,76 --> 0:12:11,63
It's one of the coolest
things I've ever seen.


333
0:12:11,63 --> 0:12:16,61
And I feel like when he skates,
he does those tricks


334
0:12:16,61 --> 0:12:18,79
like he's bouncing off
the trampoline.


335
0:12:18,79 --> 0:12:23,19
It's like, he ollies and then
taps it in the littlest parts,


336
0:12:23,19 --> 0:12:26,76
and it would flip
the right way.


337
0:12:26,76 --> 0:12:27,51
JIMMY GORECKI: The cans.


338
0:12:27,51 --> 0:12:30,77
Like the bump over the trash
cans, the tricks that he did


339
0:12:30,77 --> 0:12:33,9
over them were unfathomable.


340
0:12:33,9 --> 0:12:34,73
Like how do you even pop
your board over that


341
0:12:34,73 --> 0:12:36,59
thing, first of all?


342
0:12:36,59 --> 0:12:39,74
If you fall, those trash cans
aren't giving at all.


343
0:12:39,74 --> 0:12:41,66
Speaking of Rick, I remember one
day saying to Josh, like,


344
0:12:41,66 --> 0:12:43,79
dude, you own those
trash cans.


345
0:12:43,79 --> 0:12:45,14
And he goes, nah, Jimmy.


346
0:12:45,14 --> 0:12:46,31
That's not me.


347
0:12:46,31 --> 0:12:49,17
Rick set that off, and
I just followed suit.


348
0:12:49,17 --> 0:12:52,68



349
0:12:52,68 --> 0:12:54,75
BILL STROBECK: I think that he
was so stoked on Ricky's thing


350
0:12:54,75 --> 0:12:56,45
that he's like, dude,
I want to do some


351
0:12:56,45 --> 0:12:58,41
stuff over those things.


352
0:12:58,41 --> 0:12:58,54
RYAN GEE: Yeah.


353
0:12:58,54 --> 0:13:2,75
BILL STROBECK: I mean, that is
one of the things about LOVE.


354
0:13:2,75 --> 0:13:5,4
You would have to pry those
fucking tiles up--


355
0:13:5,4 --> 0:13:6,61
RYAN GEE: Yeah, they
were so hard--


356
0:13:6,61 --> 0:13:9,52
BILL STROBECK: And you would
have three, four, kids


357
0:13:9,52 --> 0:13:12,36
sticking their boards in the
crack on each side and prying


358
0:13:12,36 --> 0:13:13,58
it, and then it would get up.


359
0:13:13,58 --> 0:13:16,54
And as soon as it got up, kids
would sit down and wait, and


360
0:13:16,54 --> 0:13:18,4
just watch to see who'd
go over it.


361
0:13:18,4 --> 0:13:21,6



362
0:13:21,6 --> 0:13:22,33
JOSH KALIS: This is LOVE Park.


363
0:13:22,33 --> 0:13:25,99



364
0:13:25,99 --> 0:13:28,22
This is some funny-ass
shit, this story.


365
0:13:28,22 --> 0:13:30,54
So when LOVE got the fence put
around it and they shut the


366
0:13:30,54 --> 0:13:33,51
fucking place down, this
crackhead used to come in


367
0:13:33,51 --> 0:13:34,69
front of my house, and he'd
knock on the door and be like


368
0:13:34,69 --> 0:13:36,7
hey, you need your fucking
sidewalk swept


369
0:13:36,7 --> 0:13:36,81
for a buck or something?


370
0:13:36,81 --> 0:13:39,58
I was like, I'll tell
you what, man.


371
0:13:39,58 --> 0:13:42,75
I'll give you $1,000 if you go
over there and get me one of


372
0:13:42,75 --> 0:13:43,64
them tiles.


373
0:13:43,64 --> 0:13:44,82
It's got to be an original.


374
0:13:44,82 --> 0:13:47,46
Either the maroon or the grey.


375
0:13:47,46 --> 0:13:48,76
And he was like, ppphbt.


376
0:13:48,76 --> 0:13:50,23
Consider it done.


377
0:13:50,23 --> 0:13:52,2
Three days later, fucking--


378
0:13:52,2 --> 0:13:53,24
[MIMICS KNOCK].


379
0:13:53,24 --> 0:13:54,5
Dude had it in a
shopping cart.


380
0:13:54,5 --> 0:13:56,6
I was like, what?


381
0:13:56,6 --> 0:13:57,44
How A fuck did you get that?


382
0:13:57,44 --> 0:13:58,51
He's like, that's my problem.


383
0:13:58,51 --> 0:14:2,1
Fucking drove him to the bank,
took out a G, boom.


384
0:14:2,1 --> 0:14:4,1
INTERVIEWER: Whose signatures
are those?


385
0:14:4,1 --> 0:14:7,97
JOSH KALIS: Those are like,
probably Rasul or Jason or


386
0:14:7,97 --> 0:14:9,22
something like that.


387
0:14:9,22 --> 0:14:11,77



388
0:14:11,77 --> 0:14:13,48
MALE SPEAKER: He told me never
to come back in here, even


389
0:14:13,48 --> 0:14:15,18
though this is a public park.


390
0:14:15,18 --> 0:14:18,58



391
0:14:18,58 --> 0:14:19,79
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, Kalis.


392
0:14:19,79 --> 0:14:21,21
JIMMY GORECKI: They were
always stiff on skating


393
0:14:21,21 --> 0:14:23,32
downtown, but they kind
of tolerated it.


394
0:14:23,32 --> 0:14:26,69
And then it got so bad and then
when they put the fences


395
0:14:26,69 --> 0:14:30,37
up and remodeled and everything,
it was like, they


396
0:14:30,37 --> 0:14:33,1
just stuck a knife right
into the lung of


397
0:14:33,1 --> 0:14:35,11
the skateboard community.


398
0:14:35,11 --> 0:14:36,64
Shit just deflated, you know?


399
0:14:36,64 --> 0:14:40,22
You could just walk in that
place and you tingled, you


400
0:14:40,22 --> 0:14:41,6
know what I mean?


401
0:14:41,6 --> 0:14:44,25
It just made you skate
better, being there.


402
0:14:44,25 --> 0:14:46,5
I remember being there a couple
years afterwards and


403
0:14:46,5 --> 0:14:46,98
being, like, fuck, man.


404
0:14:46,98 --> 0:14:48,38
This is difficult.


405
0:14:48,38 --> 0:14:49,49
What happened?


406
0:14:49,49 --> 0:14:52,7
We used to have so much life
down here and now it's super


407
0:14:52,7 --> 0:14:52,91
depressing.


408
0:14:52,91 --> 0:14:55,47
I remember being young, being
bummed, like oh, man, these


409
0:14:55,47 --> 0:14:58,57
guys just come to the city and
then they fucking move.


410
0:14:58,57 --> 0:15:0,19
And then when I got older,
I understood.


411
0:15:0,19 --> 0:15:1,76
Like yeah, you got to keep
it moving, you know?


412
0:15:1,76 --> 0:15:2,75
You got to go to another--


413
0:15:2,75 --> 0:15:4,74
that's why Pluhowski and
Pappalardo, these guys took


414
0:15:4,74 --> 0:15:7,1
off and went to other
cities, you know?


415
0:15:7,1 --> 0:15:10,55
JOSH KALIS: The downtown-style
culture seems dead.


416
0:15:10,55 --> 0:15:12,68
Like nobody gives a shit about
going downtown, 'cause they


417
0:15:12,68 --> 0:15:13,43
don't wanna--


418
0:15:13,43 --> 0:15:15,73
I don't know if it's they don't
want to deal with it, or


419
0:15:15,73 --> 0:15:18,0
there just isn't as many
inner city kids?


420
0:15:18,0 --> 0:15:22,74
I don't know what the deal
is, but in Barcelona,


421
0:15:22,74 --> 0:15:24,2
it's still city vibe.


422
0:15:24,2 --> 0:15:27,5



423
0:15:27,5 --> 0:15:30,84
The first time I went to Sants--
because Macba is cool,


424
0:15:30,84 --> 0:15:32,71
but it's the tourist spot.


425
0:15:32,71 --> 0:15:34,69
Sants was more, like the--


426
0:15:34,69 --> 0:15:36,21
they had their squat.


427
0:15:36,21 --> 0:15:38,7
And when I got there, it was
spray-painted on the wall, it


428
0:15:38,7 --> 0:15:39,88
said, "Go Home."


429
0:15:39,88 --> 0:15:41,73
And I knew the story
behind Go Home.


430
0:15:41,73 --> 0:15:42,98
And it was talking
about Americans.


431
0:15:42,98 --> 0:15:46,12
Like fucking quit coming
here and filming.


432
0:15:46,12 --> 0:15:49,13
So I went there and I fucking
introduced myself and they


433
0:15:49,13 --> 0:15:50,195
were all sitting
on their table.


434
0:15:50,195 --> 0:15:51,39
I was like, hey, what's up?


435
0:15:51,39 --> 0:15:53,426
I'm Josh, man.


436
0:15:53,426 --> 0:15:55,37
You don't give a shit if I
skate around for a little


437
0:15:55,37 --> 0:15:56,2
while, do you?


438
0:15:56,2 --> 0:15:56,92
Maybe film some shit?


439
0:15:56,92 --> 0:15:57,69
And they were like--


440
0:15:57,69 --> 0:16:1,17
Raoul, he says in some super
broken English, he was like,


441
0:16:1,17 --> 0:16:5,44
Josh, you are a plaza skater
and we are plaza skaters.


442
0:16:5,44 --> 0:16:7,18
Like, feel free.


443
0:16:7,18 --> 0:16:9,6
And I was like, get the
fuck out of here.


444
0:16:9,6 --> 0:16:10,38
You know what I mean?


445
0:16:10,38 --> 0:16:11,49
So I felt welcome.


446
0:16:11,49 --> 0:16:13,12
And they welcomed
me in like that.


447
0:16:13,12 --> 0:16:14,92
Coolest dudes, man.


448
0:16:14,92 --> 0:16:15,87
Coolest dudes.


449
0:16:15,87 --> 0:16:20,55
And Ruben Garcia, he's like the
fucking man over there.


450
0:16:20,55 --> 0:16:25,27



451
0:16:25,27 --> 0:16:29,11
The vibe is like late
'90s US vibe.


452
0:16:29,11 --> 0:16:30,37
Plaza vibe.


453
0:16:30,37 --> 0:16:31,85
City vibe.


454
0:16:31,85 --> 0:16:35,1
You hang out all day
in one spot.


455
0:16:35,1 --> 0:16:37,59
And the reason why you filmed
it is because--


456
0:16:37,59 --> 0:16:40,3
or the reason why I filmed
it is because I


457
0:16:40,3 --> 0:16:42,29
just loved the day.


458
0:16:42,29 --> 0:16:44,69
I loved being with my friends.


459
0:16:44,69 --> 0:16:45,76
I loved the spot.


460
0:16:45,76 --> 0:16:47,131
I'm gonna film on it.


461
0:16:47,131 --> 0:16:50,79



462
0:16:50,79 --> 0:16:52,22
It's kind of hard to explain.


463
0:16:52,22 --> 0:16:54,59
It's more of just the feeling,
and that's the kind of feeling


464
0:16:54,59 --> 0:16:56,34
that I like to skate with.


465
0:16:56,34 --> 0:16:57,54
I like to film--


466
0:16:57,54 --> 0:16:58,38
the more the merrier.


467
0:16:58,38 --> 0:17:1,7
If I go to the spot with 10
dudes and get kicked out in


468
0:17:1,7 --> 0:17:4,2
five minutes, I'd rather do
that than go on secret


469
0:17:4,2 --> 0:17:6,349
missions just so I can try
to get this trick.


470
0:17:6,349 --> 0:17:8,579
I don't really dig that.


471
0:17:8,579 --> 0:17:12,329
And that's kind of how, at
least in the pro skating


472
0:17:12,329 --> 0:17:13,29
world, it's gone.


473
0:17:13,29 --> 0:17:15,339
It's been like that
for a few years.


474
0:17:15,339 --> 0:17:18,254
And Spain is just to
get away from that.


475
0:17:18,254 --> 0:17:20,39
I don't give a shit if my
footage doesn't look as good.


476
0:17:20,39 --> 0:17:25,4
I don't care if it's not with
the best A-list filmer


477
0:17:25,4 --> 0:17:26,43
and all that shit.


478
0:17:26,43 --> 0:17:27,15
I really don't care.


479
0:17:27,15 --> 0:17:30,24
If I'm with my homies, we're
having a good time, and


480
0:17:30,24 --> 0:17:33,7
everyone's skating, that's
what I want to film.


481
0:17:33,7 --> 0:17:35,12
I want to be a part of
that shit, you know?


482
0:17:35,12 --> 0:19:35,12
