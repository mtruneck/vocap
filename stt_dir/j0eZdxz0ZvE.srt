What's happening food tube, I'm going to make
a banana and guava ketchup. DJ BBQ has done


2
0:0:7,52 --> 0:0:12,67
a chunky banana ketchup, beautiful. I'm going
to do my own ketchup using guava, which is


3
0:0:12,67 --> 0:0:18,4
quite native to Jamaica.
Got a pot, got a banana, let's chop this up


4
0:0:18,4 --> 0:0:25,99
just to help it break down. I want to go two
bananas. These are the guavas. Let's give


5
0:0:25,99 --> 0:0:29,21
it a little peel. It's like mixture really,
of a pear and an apple.


6
0:0:29,21 --> 0:0:32,18
You don't have to take any of the seeds out
like you do in a pear, just put the whole


7
0:0:32,18 --> 0:0:38,51
lot in. Two of these, that's all I need. Boom,
in it goes. Banana and guava.


8
0:0:38,51 --> 0:0:43,94
When it comes to putting in your vinegar and
sugar it's all about balancing. So the sugar


9
0:0:43,94 --> 0:0:46,76
for the sweetness and the vinegar for the
sharpness.


10
0:0:46,76 --> 0:0:50,79
Caster sugar, two heaped tablespoons I reckon
in there so far. Right I've got white wine


11
0:0:50,79 --> 0:0:56,229
vinegar here. I'm going to put about 50mls
in. All this is doing is really loosening


12
0:0:56,229 --> 0:1:4,26
it up and adding that acidity to it. Let's
pop the heat on.


13
0:1:4,26 --> 0:1:9,48
Lovely. Keep an eye on it because it will
take literally minutes. Little bit of water


14
0:1:9,48 --> 0:1:14,98
in there. Now I'm just going to mash it up
a little bit. I just want to see the consistency


15
0:1:14,98 --> 0:1:21,81
and if I need to add any more vinegar or water.
Let's have a little look.


16
0:1:21,81 --> 0:1:27,13
Sweet, acidic, the banana hasn't had enough
of a chance yet, it's not quite ripe but once


17
0:1:27,13 --> 0:1:34,61
I blitz it up. Boom, we'll be there! Wonderful.
I'm going to let it tick away, when it starts


18
0:1:34,61 --> 0:1:39,25
boiling, give it a minute.
Can you see there? It's just enough liquid


19
0:1:39,25 --> 0:1:46,8
just to keep it all together.
Spot on, the guava's coming through, little


20
0:1:46,8 --> 0:1:51,84
bit of banana now and that acidity from the
vinegar is not as harsh as it was before.


21
0:1:51,84 --> 0:1:56,7
So that's ready.
if you haven't got one of these blenders,


22
0:1:56,7 --> 0:1:59,549
don't panic you can have it quite chunky if
you like. If you've got a potato masher or


23
0:1:59,549 --> 0:2:3,909
something like that or a ricer. Put it through
that.


24
0:2:3,909 --> 0:2:11,66
Good. I want it really smooth, so I'm going
to put it through a little sieve first you


25
0:2:11,66 --> 0:2:17,23
know what I mean. Oh yeah!
Now I'm going to let that cool down and it


26
0:2:17,23 --> 0:2:22,14
will be ready to go beautiful.
That's my banana and guava ketchup complete.


27
0:2:22,14 --> 0:2:28,59
Wonderful west Indian fried chicken, wow.
Ketchup we made, banana and guava. Little


28
0:2:28,59 --> 0:2:33,99
bit of that on top.
Mmmm, that ketchup's banging. If you can get


29
0:2:33,99 --> 0:2:38,7
your hands on some guava go for it guys, it
really is worth it.


30
0:2:38,7 --> 0:4:38,7
Mate, I'm off.
