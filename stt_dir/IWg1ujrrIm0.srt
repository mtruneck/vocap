0:0:13,76 --> 0:0:14,326
Hi, I'm Aaron Rose.


4
0:0:14,326 --> 0:0:17,94



5
0:0:17,94 --> 0:0:22,9
Barry McGee is a San
Francisco-based artist.


6
0:0:22,9 --> 0:0:26,67
His drawings, paintings, and
mixed media installations take


7
0:0:26,67 --> 0:0:29,95
their inspiration from
contemporary urban culture,


8
0:0:29,95 --> 0:0:34,18
incorporating elements such as
empty liquor bottles and spray


9
0:0:34,18 --> 0:0:37,921
paint cans, found wood
and scrap metal.


10
0:0:37,921 --> 0:0:45,14



11
0:0:45,14 --> 0:0:49,47
His work has been featured in
solo exhibitions at the Walker


12
0:0:49,47 --> 0:0:53,98
Arts Center in Minneapolis, the
Prada Foundation in Milan,


13
0:0:53,98 --> 0:0:58,65
Brandeis University's Rose Art
Museum, and the Watari Museum


14
0:0:58,65 --> 0:1:1,3
of Contemporary Art in Tokyo.


15
0:1:1,3 --> 0:1:4,59
We sat down with him recently
for this rare interview.


16
0:1:4,59 --> 0:1:17,2



17
0:1:17,2 --> 0:1:22,5
In recent years, your work has
become much more conceptual.


18
0:1:22,5 --> 0:1:30,91
[ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING]


19
0:1:30,91 --> 0:1:31,96
AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]


20
0:1:31,96 --> 0:1:36,62
The geometric panels,
for example.


21
0:1:36,62 --> 0:1:38,32
Where does the inspiration
for the


22
0:1:38,32 --> 0:1:41,88
geometric/conceptual work come from?


23
0:1:41,88 --> 0:1:42,29
BARRY MCGEE: [SPANISH-ACCENTED
SYNTHESIZED VOICE]


24
0:1:42,29 --> 0:1:45,263
I became bored of the
faces and imagery.


25
0:1:45,263 --> 0:1:47,915
I had been waiting for
my encounter with


26
0:1:47,915 --> 0:1:51,66
abstraction for some time.


27
0:1:51,66 --> 0:1:55,356
It was very slow coming.


28
0:1:55,356 --> 0:1:58,689
It was and is a slow-motion
car crash for me.


29
0:1:58,689 --> 0:2:1,4
I'm still spinning
out, waiting for


30
0:2:1,4 --> 0:2:2,856
impact, to some degree.


31
0:2:2,856 --> 0:2:12,18



32
0:2:12,18 --> 0:2:12,378
AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]


33
0:2:12,378 --> 0:2:17,33
What is it about San Francisco
that interests you?


34
0:2:17,33 --> 0:2:17,591
BARRY MCGEE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]


35
0:2:17,591 --> 0:2:20,72
Well, there really is no city
like San Francisco.


36
0:2:20,72 --> 0:2:24,8
There are so many different
economies running right up


37
0:2:24,8 --> 0:2:25,97
against each other.


38
0:2:25,97 --> 0:2:29,403
It has changed quite a bit
in the last 10 years.


39
0:2:29,403 --> 0:2:32,66
But somehow, it still retains
a solid population of freaks


40
0:2:32,66 --> 0:2:33,32
and anarchists.


41
0:2:33,32 --> 0:2:37,532
What can be better than an aging
transvestite anarchist?


42
0:2:37,532 --> 0:2:40,346



43
0:2:40,346 --> 0:2:40,7
AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]


44
0:2:40,7 --> 0:2:44,406
Do you think the city has
had an influence on you?


45
0:2:44,406 --> 0:2:44,763
BARRY MCGEE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]


46
0:2:44,763 --> 0:2:46,6
Yes, it has.


47
0:2:46,6 --> 0:2:49,99
But I'm starting to let other
environments slip in also.


48
0:2:49,99 --> 0:3:2,66



49
0:3:2,66 --> 0:3:2,93
AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]


50
0:3:2,93 --> 0:3:13,855
McGee is also a graffiti artist
working on the streets


51
0:3:13,855 --> 0:3:18,955
since the 1980s, where he is
known by the tag name Twist.


52
0:3:18,955 --> 0:3:22,52



53
0:3:22,52 --> 0:3:26,854
His trademark icon, a
caricatured male figure with


54
0:3:26,854 --> 0:3:30,25
sagging eyes and a bemused
expression, recalls the


55
0:3:30,25 --> 0:3:33,68
homeless people and transients
who call the


56
0:3:33,68 --> 0:3:35,0
streets their home.


57
0:3:35,0 --> 0:3:38,97
It communicates the artist's
strong empathy with people who


58
0:3:38,97 --> 0:3:42,12
have been left behind by
contemporary society.


59
0:3:42,12 --> 0:3:50,594



60
0:3:50,594 --> 0:3:54,8
Rather than being another
graffiti artist who does


61
0:3:54,8 --> 0:3:58,51
things in galleries, I've always
considered your work to


62
0:3:58,51 --> 0:4:1,59
be much more about the
history of graffiti.


63
0:4:1,59 --> 0:4:3,546
Would you agree?


64
0:4:3,546 --> 0:4:3,894
BARRY MCGEE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]


65
0:4:3,894 --> 0:4:6,99
Well, there is a great
history of graffiti


66
0:4:6,99 --> 0:4:7,91
and graffiti writers.


67
0:4:7,91 --> 0:4:12,31
I only take part in a small blip
in the scale of things.


68
0:4:12,31 --> 0:4:13,82
Galleries are boring.


69
0:4:13,82 --> 0:4:14,97
You know that, Aaron.


70
0:4:14,97 --> 0:4:19,218
That's why there is so much
graffiti on the streets.


71
0:4:19,218 --> 0:4:23,224
This trend of graffiti in
galleries will pass, and


72
0:4:23,224 --> 0:4:26,2
something truly more horrific
will replace it.


73
0:4:26,2 --> 0:4:28,502
All artists: Please
get back in the


74
0:4:28,502 --> 0:4:29,752
safety of the galleries.


75
0:4:29,752 --> 0:4:34,43



76
0:4:34,43 --> 0:4:34,616
AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]


77
0:4:34,616 --> 0:4:38,8
What is the difference for you
in working at a gallery, in a


78
0:4:38,8 --> 0:4:40,7
museum, or on the street?


79
0:4:40,7 --> 0:4:40,439
BARRY MCGEE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]


80
0:4:40,439 --> 0:4:41,54
One is boring.


81
0:4:41,54 --> 0:4:42,79
One isn't.


82
0:4:42,79 --> 0:4:47,0



83
0:4:47,0 --> 0:4:47,216
AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]


84
0:4:47,216 --> 0:4:49,71
What do you think about
the art world?


85
0:4:49,71 --> 0:4:50,7
BARRY MCGEE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]


86
0:4:50,7 --> 0:4:51,638
It is really great.


87
0:4:51,638 --> 0:4:54,7
The energy is really good,
with lots of fresh young


88
0:4:54,7 --> 0:4:56,346
upstarts moving in
every month.


89
0:4:56,346 --> 0:4:58,13
How else would we
have met, Aaron?


90
0:4:58,13 --> 0:5:7,17



91
0:5:7,17 --> 0:5:7,476
AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]


92
0:5:7,476 --> 0:5:11,16
Destruction seems to be a common
thread in your work.


93
0:5:11,16 --> 0:5:15,146
What is it about chaos that
inspires you and your artwork?


94
0:5:15,146 --> 0:5:15,449
BARRY MCGEE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]


95
0:5:15,449 --> 0:5:17,974
It takes a lot of work
to destroy something.


96
0:5:17,974 --> 0:5:22,49
I've worked the last 25 years
building, day in, day out.


97
0:5:22,49 --> 0:5:24,88
They painted over everything
I built.


98
0:5:24,88 --> 0:5:29,14
Even my oldest rooftop graffiti
masterpiece from the


99
0:5:29,14 --> 0:5:31,62
late '80s is gone.


100
0:5:31,62 --> 0:5:33,73
Destruction is all around us.


101
0:5:33,73 --> 0:5:35,524
They can't destroy me.


102
0:5:35,524 --> 0:5:37,11
I've only just begun.


103
0:5:37,11 --> 0:7:37,11
