###0 that houses recently approved uh... a last minute addition to the agricultural
###5 appropriations bill that would basically protect monsanto
###9 from litigation if there's any evidence indicating that she and most cause any
###13 type of health or seen health hazards uh... which is completely disasters
###18 before you comment and jump inject let me tell you how this was done
###21 first of all it was proposed by
###24 and an honest member of the house we don't know what is which is super
###27 questionable
###28 so
###28 this is as usual
###30 uh... politics as usual where they justice
###33 like out there must have felt what
###35 deal would you like
###37 oclc debate we don't know if that's the day stating that they would only go to
###41 judiciary committee or any other gotten and committee
###43 and by the way who ask for this
###46 it's not republicans the democrats are in charge the senate and it seems that
###50 id originally
###52 that idea came from the senate obviously both the house and senate have to agree
###55 to it by president obama has assigned it anne got put in into a uh... budget deal
###60 that have to pass
###62 so this is what the intrepid
###64 the budget deal has to pass some corrupt politician which they're all corrupt
###68 almost all corrupt right
###70 says ok gut
###71 i'm a sneak this into the bill ok answers the bill passed the past they
###75 have to vote for haha
###76 and is no debate
###78 if the president
###80 didn't want that to be in the bill it would have been in the bell abdullah
###84 spare me like to go to the clintons moods of the president as though they
###87 did it
###88 not about defeat of the senators and representatives
###91 listen if you put this in the bill i'm not on on board board i will be toward
###95 et cetera there's no way it's in the bill
###98 instead of course has always the mobile app
###101 and the corporates democrats alike
###103 yaz hardly a plaza
###105 appointed all i think you should think about how we became worse that it is so
###109 someone and they didn't know what they're completely blown
###112 one of the poison dart group unless needed but wanted boxes so i really do
###117 you mean
###117 get out of jail free car and some sick of the got a job regards the bankers get
###122 one now these but you know companies that are doing genetically modified
###126 foods gets a j get out of jail free cart you've got in trouble they had a
###130 breakdown that
###131 ever on you
###132 local aberystwyth below what i have a step in shorts
###136 also useful for two thousand rides and other daughter does another time within
###140 the who served on the efforts so what blood centers monsanto behave screw up
###145 our entire food supply
###148 who cares you know a lot of reading the court
###151 but look i daresay monsanto dead and you have to understand these companies they
###155 do a good as well as back right you know they've increased
###158 it they've got plenty of increasing the food supply cetera now of course the
###163 downside of mass until and other companies in the field
###166 is many for the we've done many stories about that determination of the farmers
###171 you know and then getting this involving
###173 and other crops that might cause birla probs
###176 putting that aside what do you agree or disagree opined that outrageous or the
###180 balance of how you but look at all those factors you can upgrade with a lot of
###185 says know what has occurred
###187 yes and i think that that's the important thing to keep in mind here a
###190 lot of times when it comes to you any issue
###192 uh... involving monsanto if monsanto gets a pass at something people will be
###196 like don't criticize anything anti science but it didn't work this has
###200 nothing to do with science
###201 this has to do with consumer protections this has to do with
###205 you know making sure that you know that these uh... the behavior of monsanto
###209 isn't impacting the environment and negative way and i love that you mention
###213 that there are signs and downsized monsanto of course they're creating
###216 genetically modified crops beckett withstand a hot climate change and the
###221 horrible things that were already doing to the environment but at the same time
###224 no peer reviewed studies indicating that g_m_ also are one hundred percent say
###228 i know that at this point it's conventional wisdom alex safe don't
###231 worry about it don't worry about it because i think i like that but support
###234 letters will be pocket just released
###236 and there's no question that we're not talking about is any way shape or form
###240 once said to have to do this religiously key way
###243 now if u are
###245 i think you've got a permissive product why would you get your bride politicians
###250 to make sure they put the law and that this is you can't be sooo
###254 weicker's you worried about the that you're gonna get sued what they know
###256 that we don't know if i didn't question monsanto before which i did i was just a
###261 question of after this one
###263 and by the way how much of the bride politicians okay so the provision
###267 success is viewed by many as a victory by companies like as ingenta corporation
###272 cargill uh... monsanto an affiliate tax
###275 they donated seven point five million to members of congress since two thousand
###278 nine
###280 and three hundred seventy two thousand two members of stat of the senate
###283 appropriations committee
###285 yes seven half million dollars and they probably do that i would go into the
###288 hard having nothing to do with molly get out of jail free card and again i keep
###292 seeing job courses
###294 civil litigation
###295 but it's just term of art area in terms of
###298 being free of liability and so
###301 i'd
###302 if you thought you know bob was going to bring you change you're nuts
###308 phone safety czar
###309 the food safety czar is the former top lobbyist
###313 or monsanto but was he a pot appointed by it
###317 president frodo block

###320 guy loves corporations will do anything for his lobbyist and donor friends
###325 and he lobbied in in in in i'm sorry argued ford two thousand eight
###330 that he was gonna bring change into the south dakota washington
###333 where lobbyists and owners got special deals
###336 does this look like a steel this looks like the exactly the kind of special
###340 deal
###341 the robot was said he would stop
###343 instead always done instead that process up
###346 with bob insurance like this
###348 he is a julliard and owner of fraud
###352 so you think that's too strong
