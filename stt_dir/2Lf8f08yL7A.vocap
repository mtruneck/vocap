###4 >> Bobson Mercier: Haiti, once a
###5 lush land covered in trees.
###7 This part of the Caribbean that was once known as the Pearl of
###10 the Antilles.
###12 60% was tropical rainforest.
###15 Deforestation has depleted this pearl, which as devastated the
###18 land, causing soul erosion, flash floods,
###21 and desertification.
###23 By 1988, only 2% of the land had tree cover and nothing better
###29 symbolizes a cycle of poverty like the
###32 process of deforestation.
###34 But the trees are not cut down for mere sport, but they are
###38 used for life sustaining purposes like charcoal for
###41 heating and cooking and wood for the building of
###43 homes for families.
###46 The Haiti Connection has joined efforts with our Haitian
###48 brothers and sisters to replenish the land with trees
###51 and cover the mountaintops with green hats.
###55 The reality is, Haiti will never be able to be reforested.
###59 Nevertheless, it is still possible to stop the erosion,
###63 to create many forest, and to empower young people to protect
###66 the land for their future and to create a landscape that
###70 shows the depth and the beauty of its people.
###75 [Singing].
###101 [no dialogue].
###114 >> Roy Lahman: You know, all of our studies
###116 and all the things we did before to get ready to go to Haiti,
###118 we knew that Haiti was called the Pearl of the Antilles.
###121 That it provided for a third of the GDP, this little part of the
###125 island, a third of the island the size of Maryland provided a
###128 third of the GDP for France when it was one of its colonies.
###131 That's why France was willing to sell the Louisiana Purchase in
###134 order to keep Haiti.
###135 It's crazy when you think about it but that's how beautiful
###137 Haiti was at one time and we recognize and realize that where
###142 once was 65% tropical rain forest was now less than 2% even
###146 by the time we go there.
###147 And so it's always been in our heart, I think, when we started
###150 walking with people, we hear stories, we hear stories about
###153 how beautiful Haiti was and all that and it is still beautiful,
###156 it's so gorgeous.
###157 But you think such denuded, so denuded the mountains are so
###161 denuded and poverty is a cruel mistress, a horribly cruel
###165 mistress or master--which ever one you want to say, I guess I
###168 should say it's a cruel master, whatever.
###170 And so with poverty, farmers cut down the trees.
###172 They cut it down for the number one culprit, chabon--charcoal to
###175 cook with because they need to make a living and you can't
###178 blame them.
###183 My definition of deforestation is actually two-fold.
###188 Okay, one is sort of the functional sense, meaning when a
###191 forest loses its ability to, to work as an entity.
###196 What I mean by that is that is that a forest serves in many
###200 different capacities.
###201 One, it serves as method for collection rainwater.
###205 In areas they get an awful lot of rain, particularly if that is
###208 coming at high velocity, you know, during the tropical storm
###213 or something of that nature.
###215 The forest serves to soak up that excess moisture and reduces
###219 flooding, so that's one problem.
###220 So deforestation occurs when enough of the forest is removed
###223 where that function is missing.
###228 Deforestation also occurs, though, when it leads to--from
###231 an economic standpoint, the lack of the ability of people to
###234 utilize that for basic needs, okay.
###238 In other words when they cut down too many trees, there are a
###241 lack of trees for charcoal production for example, for home
###245 heating, for building and things of that nature.
###249 When you cut down all the trees, particularly in an area where
###252 you have some sort of slope, that's going to lead to erosion
###256 being advanced.
###258 It's also going to lead to flooding being a problem.
###261 So people who have built and who live in these areas, they're
###264 subject to flash floods on greater bases.
###267 Their fields, if they begin to farm those fields, are not very
###271 stable, they grow erode very, very quickly.
###275 And obviously this is not sustainable situation for a
###277 country that is already--they have a tenuous ability to
###281 provide for themselves anyway from an agricultural standpoint
###283 or from an economic standpoint.
###286 So that's one of the major problems with deforestation.
###289 Another, in a more broader perspective has to do with, you
###293 know, global temperature and climate change because these
###298 forests serve as method for dealing with carbon.
###304 They collect carbon rather than admit carbon into the
###306 atmosphere, so these are what we call carbon sinks, are no longer
###310 available to do that job.
###311 So that's kind of the more broad perspective, a more localized
###313 perspective, increased flooding, increased erosion
###317 are big problems.
###320 There's a very famous--you can find this on the
###322 Internet--photos where you see, they show the boarder line
###326 between the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
###328 The Dominican Republic, because that is a protective boarder,
###331 there are plenty of trees on that side; the other side is
###335 denuded of trees.
###336 There are several reasons for this, one is because of the lack
###339 of opportunity for many Haitians, they are forced to use
###346 that lumber for basic needs.
###348 For heating, for building and things of that nature,
###352 charcoal production.
###354 So they've cut down the trees, with very little official
###358 oversight, even in resent years so that's lead to the complete
###362 denuding of that land scape.
###364 Unfortunately, when you do something like that, you open
###367 the area up to flooding and flash flooding is a major
###370 problem in much of rural Haiti.
###373 But once again, you can't blame the people for cutting down the
###375 trees, they need those resources to survive and, you
###379 know, until another method for fuel and other types of building
###385 material, till that happens, you will continue to see
###388 deforestation being a major problem in Haiti.
###394 >> Roy Lanham: So when you begin to look at
###396 this, you begin to think, what is possible and as we begin to
###397 look at my Haitian brothers and sisters, once again,
###400 walking with and not doing for, but walking with.
###403 How keys is that?
###404 And we've learned over the years that we've found a couple folks
###407 that kind of changed our lives and how we saw the issue of
###410 reforestation in Haiti.
###411 One was a woman named sister Pat Dillon, an American, works in
###415 Gros-Morne we met her twelve years ago now.
###417 She is the Lorax of Gros-Morne The women loves tries beyond
###421 belief and she believed in beyond belief that what could be
###424 transformed, how Haiti can be transformed and Haitians lives
###428 can be transformed if they can just begin to reforest
###431 if you will.
###432 Now they all know they can't.
###434 The farmers need the land, they can 't totally reforest by they
###436 can have "ti fore", small forest, quarter acre forest and
###440 they can begin and begin to do fence rows and things like that.
###442 And they will begin to save the land and they begin to work on
###445 this and educate and the whole bit and what she was doing up
###447 there in Gros-Morne has made such an impact, we started
###450 working with a group of individuals called AJGR.
###453 This is the kind of impact they had.
###455 A group of Haitians, young Haitians got together and they
###457 wanted then to make their land more beautiful, to make Haiti
###461 more beautiful for future generations.
###463 We had the opportunity to begin to work with them.
###465 And we begin to work with them on a reforestation project and
###468 it was just a little hillside, it was a learning center so that
###472 they can teach future generations about the power of
###475 caring for the earth, caring for the land.
###477 Being good stewards of what God has given us.
###480 It was amazing, it was really cool.
###481 It never really get off the ground,
###483 as it should of, unfortunately.
###484 These are one of these things that we've learned when
###486 we've been in Haiti, that not everything is going
###487 to be successful.
###489 Not everything's always going to be where we come out the
###491 other end and say, "Wow, look at us, look what we did."
###493 Naw, some things are going to fail and maybe something will be
###496 learned, not just on our side, but also on the side in Haiti.
###499 AJGR and our relationship with them failed.
###501 We did somethings, we tried, we tried, we tried, we built a
###504 cistern, we did all these things, we planted thousands of
###506 trees, you know, but it just never clicked because it always
###510 came off as us doing for them.
###513 They kind of went there separate way and guess what, AJGR is
###517 blooming and blossoming and growing in ways we could have
###519 never imagined, had we stayed with them.
###521 They began to realize that they became so dependent on us doing
###524 for them, and we had realized that we were so frustrated that
###527 actually parting the ways allowed for some really cool
###530 things to happen with them.
###532 And that's been a cool thing, but it didn't take away our
###534 desire for reforestation and to do some real things
###537 with reforestation.
###538 And what happen was, it really kind of once again, it had
###541 everything to do with the relationships
###543 first and foremost.
###545 Down there is Barada once again, and Fonds-Verrettes.
###549 We wrote for a grant, one of our alums wrote for a grant to see
###552 if we could--with the company that she had worked with--and to
###554 see if she could get some money for a reforestation projects.
###557 It was called the ti fore project, we called it,
###560 Project Lorax.
###562 Lorax is this famous character from Dr. Seuss, you know, its
###565 kind of speaking for the trees and we didn't get the grant, we
###567 didn't get it.
###569 But here is what's amazing; the students said this is too
###571 important because we had talked to the people in Haiti.
###573 Especially after the floods that happened that destroyed
###576 Fonds-Verrettes in the area, it is because they didn't have
###578 trees and they really long for that.
###580 They long for a partner with this, so we decided we will,
###583 we'll partner with you but we said we needed to find a guy on
###585 the ground that can be our partner.
###586 Well, we found him, his name is Rodrigue Manigar, he is the
###589 Lorax of Fonds-Verrettes.
###592 ♪ [music playing] ♪♪.
###940 >> Roy Lanham: He believes in
###941 reforesting Haiti.
###943 He knows it can't be all put back together, he knows that
###947 there can be green hats on every mountaintop, there can be green
###948 hats that would help with the watershed.
###950 He knows that on every mountain, there can begin to look at how
###954 the waters flowing and build rock walls and put in trenches,
###958 channels so the water just doesn't wash down the hill, it
###961 can feel up first and then go down.
###964 He knows that they can plant native trees, trees that can
###967 produce fruits.
###968 They won't cut them down for charcoal because theirs
###970 another way.
###971 Avocados can give farmers a source of income, mangos can
###975 give farmers a source of income, sweet oranges and sour oranges
###980 can give farmers a source of income, so they won't cut the
###982 trees down.
###983 We begin to look at that, so we begin to look at it.
###985 And it also brings back native hardwoods because eventually
###988 they do need--if we're really going to listen to the Haitian
###991 people and we have, they also realized we still need to cook
###995 with wood and right now this is what we've got.
###999 We need to explore some possibilities but how can we
###1002 also be planting some trees that we know in 15 years, we can cut
###1004 down as a source of fuel but use it as a crop, if you will.
###1008 So we've begun to look at that and we found a tree that they
###1011 liked that can work with that, so why should we deny
###1017 them that opportunity?
###1018 So working together, walking together.
###1019 So right now its in its infancy but its working and its
###1022 Project Lorax.
###1023 We've got too many nurseries, we've got two distributions
###1026 during the rainy season.
###1027 These are 5000 tree nurseries, it's not huge, they are mini
###1032 nurseries but then what happens in May is they--every may during
###1035 the rainy season--they give away 20 trees per person, anyone who
###1039 can come an get them, 20 trees per person and they've got to
###1041 care for these trees, plant them, care for them, keep the
###1043 goats from eating them.
###1044 And then they get visited, they actually get visited--everybody
###1047 that takes the trees get visited and they see how your trees
###1051 doing and you're rated.
###1052 And they do it, I think, four times in six months, they'll
###1056 come by and visit you and you don't know when they're coming
###1057 so you have to be ready.
###1058 And so they'll come and see how your trees are doing and this is
###1062 to encourage them to keep doing it.
###1064 We've recognized while walking with Rodrigue is that people
###1067 will always take trees but they won't care for them and the
###1070 goats will eat them, we've got to give them some incentive, the
###1072 incentive is food.
###1075 Twice a year we have a contest and the top 20 folks get their
###1082 names put in a hat and the first three people who get their name
###1088 pulled will get a bag of rice and a bag of beans and oil for
###1091 their family, they get to provide for their family.
###1093 Food securities a huge issue, even with farmers, is a huge
###1096 issue in Haiti and this gives them food security, helps them
###1099 with food so they can provide for their family.
###1101 And so, if they win, they get this bag of rice, bag of beans,
###1104 oil and we just started the contest and it worked.
###1107 And he goes, "The idea Roy is..."
###1108 this is what's so cool, he goes, "in six months a different 20
###1113 people could be in it."
###1113 So it encourages them to keep doing this so its really
###1116 excellent program that...
###1118 And what even more important is education, education
###1121 about reforestation.
###1123 So we translated this book called the Lorax and we took it
###1126 down there and it in creole and now their using it
###1129 in the schools.
###1130 Rodrigue got on the radio, everybody in Fonds-Verrettes,
###1133 everybody knows about the Lorax.
###1136 What's so amazing is that on New Years Eve at a party on New
###1141 Years Eve, two thousand people were gathered and Rodrigue read
###1146 the story of the Lorax to them and how they need to
###1149 protect the trees.
###1151 Exciting beyond belief.
###1153 We never would have thought that would be possible.
###1156 And so our project Lorax now and reforestation is in its infancy
###1159 but we see the possibilities of where it can go.
###1162 We recognize that maybe it's going to take us to a place with
###1165 alternative fuel sources, already one of them said, maybe
###1168 we need to think about alternative fuel sources, see
###1171 they're beginning to think about it and then we can begin to look
###1173 at this.
###1174 You know, Brian Flannigan who's a man who works in Haiti
###1177 in reforestation says, "When you're doing this, what you can
###1181 do is start small."
###1182 And he goes, "what you're doing is planting these many
###1183 nurseries, you getting people talking about it and you get
###1185 them excited about it and before you know it, it become theirs."
###1189 It becomes their own and they will begin to find solutions and
###1192 they'll begin to see how it can work and how it can work for
###1195 them to make their country more beautiful.

###1394 >> Bobson Mercier: Deforestation is a complex
###1395 issue with serious consequences for Haiti and the
###1398 international community if something isn't done.
###1402 We have joined hands to counter the cycle of deforestation by
###1405 educating each other in the importance of the trees and the
###1408 environment, and to cover the mountain tops with green hats,
###1412 with aspirations to return Haiti back into the beauty when she
###1416 was called the Pearl of the Antilles.

###1423 >>Roy Lanham: So much though, this is one of
###1424 our trips to Haiti, we were approached by the citizens of
###1427 Fonds-Verrettes, the mayor, the second major the third mayor
###1429 and one of the other leaders of the community, they presented
###1432 us with a letter to take back to our congress on how to help
###1435 protect a water shed area.
###1438 So because they know there are 800,000 trees in this area and
###1440 if they can protect it with a [unclear dialogue] with a wall,
###1443 with a rock wall they know that they can protect those trees so
###1446 that it can protect farm land and homes down below.
###1450 They didn't ask us for money they asked if they can go back
###1452 and talk to our congress with USAID, that does projects all
###1456 over the world because they know its a major project.
###1459 Will they consider helping them save these trees?
###1462 Amazing!
###1463 Amazing!
###1464 And that's how relationships can begin to transform lives
###1468 and its possible.
###1470 And so that's what we're doing now, we're talking to our
###1473 congress people about how can we, how can...
###1476 That's just an example of what can happen when we put
###1479 our heads together.
###1480 [unclear dialogue] as they say in Creole.
###1482 When we put our heads together what is possible?
###1485 Will Haiti ever be 62% rainforest, no, I'm not a dummy
###1489 and they know that too.
###1491 But can it be more beautiful, can it be sustainable, can we
###1497 begin to see the rains come back?
###1498 Can they begin to realize that every time it rains they don't
###1501 have to live in fear that their house is going to wash away?
###1504 Yes, yes and we can be a part of that and that's the gift that we
###1508 can bring as we walk with our brothers and sisters in Haiti,
