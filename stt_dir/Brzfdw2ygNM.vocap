###10 Here we have Gucci Mane.
###12 He's exactly like what you would
###14 imagine him to be, amazing.
###16 He was in his element in the strip club, for sure, had his
###19 game face on.
###20 We lit the whole club with these insane red and green
###24 neon filters and gels.
###26 And everyone was super high.
###29 That's a lot of Gucci's crew in the movie, and I think a
###31 lot in real life.
###32 You got Gucci's real life manager on the side, Coach K,
###36 holding a pistol.
###37 That's a serious OG right there.
###39 Here we go with Franco, again Franco and strippers, we had
###43 to throw some money.
###44 This is Dangeruss, a rapper from Saint Petersburg.
###48 I put him together with Franco before the movie.
###51 They hung out.
###52 And he was kind of a character study.
###55 These guys in here are pretty much the real deal.
###58 These dudes are legit.
###59 So I think Franco got a lot for his performance.
###63 The actual location had these amazing neons, these purple
###66 [INAUDIBLE]
###67 candy-colored lights.
###69 There's a palette I thought coincided with that world.
###73 The colors of nail polish became fluorescent colors.
###75 Benoit would shoot in these super vibrant filters.
###78 So we would pick a look, almost like in this weird
###82 magical realism, or this kind of idea that things are just
###86 the real world, except pushed it into something hyper
###89 extreme, hyper beautiful.
