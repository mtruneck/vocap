###1 STEVE SPANGLER: Ever notice there's
###2 bubbles that don't pop?
###5 Well, they do pop when they touch your skin.
###8 Why don't they pop when they're on the carpet?
###10 I think I've got some answers and some really cool things to
###13 do with bubbles that you can try at home.
###17 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###18 STEVE SPANGLER: I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all about
###20 making science fun.
###22 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###25 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###28 experiences.
###29 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###31 affect the way people think about science.
###34 And to do that, I live by one motto, "Make it big.
###37 Do it right.
###39 Give it class."
###40 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###45 STEVE SPANGLER: Well, if we're going to talk about bubbles,
###46 we need to start with bubble solution.
###48 And contrary to popular belief, it's not as easy as
###50 just taking soap and adding it to water.
###54 It probably will give you bubbles, but not the kind
###56 we're looking for.
###57 Well, if we're going to make great bubble solution, you've
###59 got to start with the right things.
###60 First of all, clean glassware.
###61 So I don't want to use something that's dirty.
###63 I'm trying to keep this as pure as possible.
###66 And clean water.
###68 Now what makes clean water?
###69 How about distilled water?
###71 Eight ounces of distilled water, 240 milliliters.
###74 And of course, that's just for the purist.
###77 The minerals, or sometimes the things that are in regular tap
###80 water, they say, can hinder the
###81 formation of great bubbles.
###83 Take it for what it's worth.
###84 We're using distilled water for these bubbles.
###87 Soap, dish soap.
###89 Now we're not looking for anything other than the
###91 cheapest generic kind of dish soap, Dawn,
###94 Lemon Joy, any of those.
###95 We just want stuff that doesn't have apple, lemon,
###98 orchard scented, H1N1-killing.
###101 You just want just good, generic soap.
###104 Into our eight ounces, we're going to add a
###107 tablespoon of soap.
###109 For our metric people out there, we're adding about 15
###112 milliliters of our Dawn dish soap to the 240
###115 milliliters of water.
###116 And this is the basis of our bubble solution.
###120 Well, now that you have bubble solution, you
###121 need a bubble wand.
###124 Don't go to the store and buy a bubble wand.
###126 I've got a better one for you.
###128 And they're made out of these things here called, pipettes.
###131 If you've been in a chemistry class, these are plastic eye
###134 droppers, so to speak.
###136 They're used to transfer a little bit of liquid from one
###138 place to the next.
###139 You can see, when you squeeze, that actually you can pull up
###141 some liquid and actually transfer it to another place.
###144 But we don't want to transfer the liquid.
###145 We actually want to use this as the bubble wand.
###147 And for that, we're going to need a pair of scissors.
###150 The trick here is simple.
###151 You're just going to cut the very end of the pipette off.
###156 And that's what you need.
###157 This becomes our end for the bubble solution.
###159 This becomes the end where you put your mouth.
###161 This works so well because, watch this.
###163 See the little pipette?
###164 This end goes in.
###165 And now there's just enough bubble solution there.
###168 It doesn't matter how hard I push the air through this, I
###173 get a great bubble.
###175 And I can shake the bubble off like this.
###177 And I've got a perfect little bubble.
###179 It's not strong, but I got a great bubble.
###182 If you want a stronger bubble, however, it means that we have
###184 to go back and add something to this bubble solution that
###186 will help strengthen the bubble.
###188 The secret is glycerine.
###190 Glycerine is this water soluble, very viscous kind of
###193 material that is perfect for the bubble solution.
###196 And the best bubble solution has always had the recipe of
###198 water, soap and glycerine.
###200 I can tell you that, if I put a tablespoon of the soap
###203 inside the cup of water here, I'm only going to use about a
###206 half a tablespoon of this.
###207 It's pretty expensive stuff, and I just don't need it.
###209 So about a half a tablespoon or about 8 milliliters or so,
###213 that's perfect.
###214 This goes in here.
###215 You can actually see it's kind of viscous
###217 here at the very bottom.
###218 See how it falls in?
###219 So it means you're going to need to stir it up.
###221 You notice how it stirs up a little bit?
###223 You can see it mixing.
###225 And while you might think it's completely mixed
###226 right now, it's not.
###228 The secret here is time.
###230 Let this bubble solution sit for 24 hours.
###233 And at the end of that, you're going to have great bubbles.
###235 You just have to wait.
###236 
###241 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###279 STEVE SPANGLER: Or I guess I should have noticed that this
###281 batch had been actually sitting around for 24 hours.
###285 Thanks, Higginsworth.
###286 A little labeling would have been nice.
###288 You can see, when you blow a bubble, look at how much
###289 surface area you have on that bubble.
###292 You could imagine all the water here trying to
###293 evaporate, just like you stepping out of the shower.
###295 And you're cold.
###296 And all that water is evaporating.
###297 Same thing happens here.
###299 That's what really causes the bubble to pop, when you're
###301 holding it like this.
###302 The glycerine chemically holds the water in tighter so that
###305 it keeps it as a longer-lasting bubble.
###309 Silly thing, though, is it still pops.
###311 Remember how the bubble didn't pop on the carpet?
###313 Well, I think I found a way to bring the
###314 carpet to your hands.
###317 You just have to get one of these silly looking gloves.
###319 It's just a kid's glove.
###320 It's a mixture of polyester and cotton.
###322 It doesn't really matter.
###324 The key here is that it's cloth.
###326 And the other key here is that it's not touching my skin.
###329 See, what pops the bubble is the oil and the dirt
###332 that's on my skin.
###333 If I could use this as the barrier to help cushion it, I
###335 might be able to bounce the bubble on my hand.
###338 All right, here's what we've learned so far.
###340 Perfect bubble solution, a combination of distilled
###342 water, Dawn dish soap and some glycerine to keep the water
###346 from evaporating.
###347 We've got a great bubble wand.
###349 This is a pipette.
###349 And you've got the glove.
###351 Watch this.
###354 You have a recipe for the perfect bouncing bubble.
###358 As soon as it touches my skin, of course, it pops.
###362 This will keep you busy for days upon days upon days.
###366 Ever notice that bubbles are always round?
###368 It doesn't take a rocket scientist to
###370 figure it out, right?
###370 You've got equal pressures pushing and pulling in all
###373 directions.
###374 It's just a perfect sphere.
###376 But what if it wasn't a perfect sphere?
###378 Could you actually change the way that bubble looks and
###381 change the shape by using some outside help?
###384 You can.
###385 That's where these building toys come on.
###388 See, these building toys are called Zometool.
###391 They're great.
###391 You could use anything you want.
###392 I really like these, because it just makes a perfect cube
###396 using these struts that are right here and these great
###398 little spheres.
###400 Granted, it's not the least expensive way to do it, but
###402 Zometool is the perfect way to make the
###405 perfect cube for bubbles.
###407 Now, if you have a hard time finding building structures
###409 like this, you always can use pipe cleaners and straws.
###414 It's easy.
###415 You just put the pipe cleaner through the straw like this,
###418 bend it, add another one.
###420 You get the idea.
###421 Ultimately, you'll come up with this.
###424 Either one works well.
###426 A bigger container of bubble solution, and you get this.
###430 Now watch.
###431 When you pull it up, you get this surface
###433 structure of this film.
###434 And as you twist it, the film does exactly what it's
###437 supposed to do.
###438 It tries to maximize the area there using the least number
###442 of lines or connecting points.
###444 And you get this really cool structure.
###446 Now watch.
###447 See the little trampoline that's there?
###448 By simply shaking it, you can make it go
###451 this way or this way.
###456 What's this cool shape called?
###458 I don't have a clue.
###459 You're going to have to find a really smart math teacher, or
###461 ask the people over at Numberphile.
###462 They know.
###465 When does a round bubble turn into a square?
###468 When you do this.
###470 Bam!
###471 
###475 Oh, you see that bubble inside the bubble?
###477 There's got to be a way to be able to keep the bubble inside
###479 the bubble.
###480 I think I've got a way to do that too.
###482 You see, for this, you use the same bubble solution.
###486 We just need a different bubble toy.
###488 And that's where this comes in.
###490 So where do you get this cool bubble wand?
###492 Probably the same place you bought all of the
###493 other bubble junk.
###494 I don't know.
###495 It's just a toy.
###496 But you want this loop.
###497 You could just make it at home.
###498 All you really want is this loop.
###499 These things on the outside really don't help me at all,
###502 other than it just holds the bubble solution, because what
###504 we need is to hold that bubble solution in place.
###508 See the film that's there?
###509 That film gives us the perfect making for a bubble.
###514 This part just takes a little bit of practice.
###516 But if you're like me, you'll get it in no time.
###519 Ready?
###520 Oh, shoot.
###521 Sorry.
###522 HIGGINSWORTH: Spangler Effect, Bubble Inside A
###523 Bubble, take two.
###524 You got this.
###525 STEVE SPANGLER: So if you're like me, it'll take no time at
###527 all, just a little tiny bit of practice.
###529 You pull like this, and you'll get the bubble.
###531 Perfect.
###531 Oh.
###532 HIGGINSWORTH: Spangler Effect, Bubble Inside A
###533 Bubble, take three.
###535 STEVE SPANGLER: If you're like me, it takes no time at all,
###537 just a little bit of practice.
###539 Watch this.
###539 You get your bubble like this.
###541 God.
###542 HIGGINSWORTH: Bubble Inside A Bubble, take seven.
###545 STEVE SPANGLER: In no time at all,
###546 you'll have this mastered.
###547 You just pull the bubble like this.
###548 
###551 HIGGINSWORTH: Bubble Inside A Bubble, take 37.
###554 STEVE SPANGLER: In no time at all, you will have a bubble
###555 inside of a bubble like this, because you just pull it like
###558 this and it'll--
###560 oh, god.
###561 HIGGINSWORTH: Take 48.
###564 STEVE SPANGLER: In no time at all, you'll have a bubble
###565 inside of a bubble.
###566 You just simply pull--
###567 HIGGINSWORTH: Take 49.
###569 STEVE SPANGLER: In no time at all, you will be a bubble--
###571 HIGGINSWORTH: Take 50.
###573 STEVE SPANGLER: You're going to be a bubble master.
###574 With just a little bit of--
###576 HIGGINSWORTH: Take 51.
###580 STEVE SPANGLER: In no time at all, you will be a bubble
###583 master, because you're going to get a bubble that is inside
###588 of a bubble that falls on the table.
###589 HIGGINSWORTH: Take 52.
###591 STEVE SPANGLER: So if you're like me, it'll take no time at
###593 all, just a little tiny bit of practice.
###595 You pull like this.
###595 And you'll get the bubble.
###597 And now you've got to catch the bubble upside down.
###599 So you see how we're catching it this way?
###601 So it's inverted on the bubble wand.
###603 And now you're going to puff a bubble in
###605 the bubble like that.
###607 
###611 See, I've been teaching teachers how to blow the
###613 bubble inside the bubble for years.
###614 And all the kids are the same.
###616 They want to be the bubble inside the bubble.
###618 So what would it take for you to be the
###620 bubble inside the bubble?
###622 Bigger tools.
###624 Higginsworth, get the swimming pool.
###626 Well, you saw a bubble inside of a bubble.
###628 And now you want to be inside the bubble?
###630 This is what you're going to need.
###631 Take a look.
###631 This is a swimming pool that has about
###633 five gallons of water.
###634 To that, we have our dish soap,
###637 and we have our glycerine.
###638 And again, we just played with the quantities, until we got a
###640 good solution.
###641 The key here, 24 hours.
###643 Let it sit.
###644 And we've started playing with this hula hoop that's here.
###647 And while that's OK, it's not nearly as good as this little
###650 contraption we made just using sprinkler irrigation pipe.
###654 So it didn't take much of it.
###656 A little trip to the hardware store, and we're set.
###658 And this gives you, now, this beautiful bubble film.
###661 Look at this.
###663 Now the object would be to put a kid inside the bubble or put
###666 you inside the bubble.
###668 That just means that you've got to find a kid.
###672 And I think I found one.
###673 Here's a kid.
###675 Here you go, kid.
###676 And if they're wearing safety glasses, it's all the better.
###680 And if they're named Ella, it's perfect.
###682 Is your name Ella?
###683 ELLA: Mm-hm.
###683 STEVE SPANGLER: See?
###683 This is perfect.
###684 All right, here we go.
###685 
###687 Nice!
###689 I know what you're thinking.
###690 Can you do it with two kids?
###692 Here's another kid.
###693 In you go, kid.
###696 All right, two kids.
###699 Here, just hug.
###700 Pretend like you're sisters.
###700 Are you sisters?
###701 ELLA: Mm-hm.
###701 FEMALE SPEAKER: Mm-hm.
###702 STEVE SPANGLER: Oh, this is perfect.
###702 All right, stay there.
###703 Don't move.
###704 Ready?
###704 Go!
###706 
###708 You're in a bubble!
###709 That was awesome!
###711 All right, hey guys, sorry about the mess.
###713 Can you get that all cleaned up for me and everything?
###715 I've got lot to do.
###716 I've got to go.
###716 Bye.
###717 See you guys later.
###718 
###735 [MAKING  MOTOR NOISES]
###737 Where did you come from?
###739 I'm bigger than you are.
###740 And I'm newer than you are.
###742 And I am--
###743 oops.
###743 Oh, my god.
###744 
###749 Higginsworth?
###750
