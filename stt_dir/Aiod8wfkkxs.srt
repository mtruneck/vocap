0:0:7,45 --> 0:0:11,21
republican and democratic establishment
or opposed to us so the wall street


4
0:0:11,21 --> 0:0:13,18
journal of course


5
0:0:13,18 --> 0:0:14,349
there to a scientist


6
0:0:14,349 --> 0:0:17,13
tremendously conservative or they
clearly think it's a really their


7
0:0:17,13 --> 0:0:21,6
corporate us they love uh... all the
multinational corporations and protect


8
0:0:21,6 --> 0:0:24,5
them and the establishment so in this
case alike

0:0:24,5 --> 0:0:28,96
extra u_s_ citizens of plus a pro
stylish banquet allotted i'll get your


10
0:0:28,96 --> 0:0:29,9
empl


11
0:0:29,9 --> 0:0:32,11
uh... here's a wall street journal quote


12
0:0:32,11 --> 0:0:36,5
gear rental credit for theatrical timing


13
0:0:36,5 --> 0:0:38,51
as a snowstorm to settle on a washington


14
0:0:38,51 --> 0:0:43,12
the filibuster fill their attention void
on twitter and cable t_v_


15
0:0:43,12 --> 0:0:46,25
it's always reasoning match the
showmanship


16
0:0:46,25 --> 0:0:48,56
people


17
0:0:48,56 --> 0:0:50,82
of the area is supposed to go


18
0:0:50,82 --> 0:0:54,45
uh... all right so what is your best of
your argument i'm curious


19
0:0:54,45 --> 0:0:55,69
well here's what they see


20
0:0:55,69 --> 0:0:57,59
calm down center


21
0:0:57,59 --> 0:0:59,71
how awesome we do mean is that


22
0:0:59,71 --> 0:1:1,68
uh... mister holder is right


23
0:1:1,68 --> 0:1:5,47
even if he doesn't explain the low very
well u_s_ government cannot randomly


24
0:1:5,47 --> 0:1:8,76
target america citizens on u_s_ soil or
anywhere else


25
0:1:8,76 --> 0:1:13,5
what it can do under the laws of war is
target than enemy combatant


26
0:1:13,5 --> 0:1:15,58
anywhere anytime


27
0:1:15,58 --> 0:1:17,62
including on u_s_ soil


28
0:1:17,62 --> 0:1:21,46
this includes and u_s_ citizen who is
also


29
0:1:21,46 --> 0:1:24,8
an enemy combatant and all of that


30
0:1:24,8 --> 0:1:26,98
his that's the wall street journal being
smug and say


31
0:1:26,98 --> 0:1:30,0
up all quote


32
0:1:30,0 --> 0:1:33,369
yourselves so i read for a number is
there is other sister


33
0:1:33,369 --> 0:1:35,12
and would you rate and there are even
though i


34
0:1:35,12 --> 0:1:39,41
well when i killing u_s_ citizens work
ily enemy combatants who are u_s_


35
0:1:39,41 --> 0:1:40,66
citizens


36
0:1:40,66 --> 0:1:43,44
but wait a minute you schwantz that's
the whole point


37
0:1:43,44 --> 0:1:46,39
who gets to the side of their an enemy
combatant


38
0:1:46,39 --> 0:1:48,34
okay so if i'm the president


39
0:1:48,34 --> 0:1:53,6
and i decided you are an enemy combatant
kenai execute you


40
0:1:53,6 --> 0:1:56,87
unlike not everyday probably wouldn't


41
0:1:56,87 --> 0:1:59,54
probably


42
0:1:59,54 --> 0:2:3,3
we don't do that in this country or we
weren't we didn't use to do that in this


43
0:2:3,3 --> 0:2:6,94
country they give the executive branch
that authority to just the claire people


44
0:2:6,94 --> 0:2:8,5
guilty


45
0:2:8,5 --> 0:2:10,99
you know that so they should do that so
we are the magna carta the kings would


46
0:2:10,99 --> 0:2:15,59
say autograph power wrong


47
0:2:15,59 --> 0:2:17,839
intended for robert


48
0:2:17,839 --> 0:2:18,979
and then


49
0:2:18,979 --> 0:2:21,579
he would be executed without a trial
without anything


50
0:2:21,579 --> 0:2:22,73
hitting a citizen


51
0:2:22,73 --> 0:2:25,579
meetings as i declared it a bit
outlawing your dog


52
0:2:25,579 --> 0:2:28,609
in a wall street journal on these
republican knuckle heads want to go back


53
0:2:28,609 --> 0:2:31,889
to that time and by the way so the
democratic not collapse


54
0:2:31,889 --> 0:2:34,849
so they when when paul says


55
0:2:34,849 --> 0:2:38,779
undermines all western civilization he's
absolutely right for the wall street


56
0:2:38,779 --> 0:2:43,609
journal snickers with sharply execute
them


57
0:2:43,609 --> 0:2:47,479
well of course and i want her comes
walmart or john mccain


58
0:2:47,479 --> 0:2:50,839
hooters ones this stuff he says


59
0:2:50,839 --> 0:2:54,729
i watch some of that quote debate on
quote yesterday i don't think that same


60
0:2:54,729 --> 0:2:55,889
quoting but


61
0:2:55,889 --> 0:2:58,23
bailey says i saw carcinoma better


62
0:2:58,23 --> 0:3:0,159
teleflora voice some of this


63
0:3:0,159 --> 0:3:1,659
uh... some concern


64
0:3:1,659 --> 0:3:4,26
we just totally unfounded really john
white


65
0:3:4,26 --> 0:3:6,59
but let's say that the user jane fonda's
name


66
0:3:6,59 --> 0:3:9,73
does a book certain memories with me and
i must say that she is not my favorite


67
0:3:9,73 --> 0:3:10,67
american


68
0:3:10,67 --> 0:3:12,139
as reported mission


69
0:3:12,139 --> 0:3:15,229
uh... could we kill her during the
vietnam war


70
0:3:15,229 --> 0:3:18,609
uh... but i also believe that as
audiences it was miss pond acted within


71
0:3:18,609 --> 0:3:20,18
our constitutional rights


72
0:3:20,18 --> 0:3:24,119
and is somehow say the someone who
disagrees with american policy and even


73
0:3:24,119 --> 0:3:25,73
demonstrates against it


74
0:3:25,73 --> 0:3:28,78
is somehow member of an organization
which makes that individual an enemy


75
0:3:28,78 --> 0:3:31,98
combatant assembly false someone falls


76
0:3:31,98 --> 0:3:33,539
well how do you know john


77
0:3:33,539 --> 0:3:35,269
you've never seen any of the evidence


78
0:3:35,269 --> 0:3:38,899
so we killed on or all of locking
sixteen-year-old son


79
0:3:38,899 --> 0:3:41,49
how do you know he was there any combat


80
0:3:41,49 --> 0:3:44,579
in fact we ask the united states
government why did you kill 'em they say


81
0:3:44,579 --> 0:3:48,78
we're not gonna say about but when it
was not purpose or was it an accident


82
0:3:48,78 --> 0:3:50,839
when i can say anything about


83
0:3:50,839 --> 0:3:54,9
so you can execute sixty or u_s_
citizens


84
0:3:54,9 --> 0:3:55,19
and not tell us


85
0:3:55,19 --> 0:3:57,279
what u_s_ senate executed them


86
0:3:57,279 --> 0:4:1,179
on what evidence let alone on what legal
principle


87
0:4:1,179 --> 0:4:3,499
and what do you want it or not


88
0:4:3,499 --> 0:4:6,73
but don't worry distrust the wall street
journal and john mccain


89
0:4:6,73 --> 0:4:9,769
effing second because i want to get out
more


90
0:4:9,769 --> 0:4:10,43
then they can


91
0:4:10,43 --> 0:4:14,189
we executed without any due process


92
0:4:14,189 --> 0:4:18,169
so he wrote some republicans the
so-called conservatives


93
0:4:18,169 --> 0:4:19,569
including the one thing


94
0:4:19,569 --> 0:4:23,18
angry with obon administration on this


95
0:4:23,18 --> 0:4:24,689
extreme


96
0:4:24,689 --> 0:4:30,11
on her door unconstitutional executive
power over your services


97
0:4:30,11 --> 0:4:34,239
of course who's going to rework them
here comes the canes laptop


98
0:4:34,239 --> 0:4:36,319
lindsey graham william lindsay


99
0:4:36,319 --> 0:4:40,2
to my republican colleagues are in
memory of you coming down here


100
0:4:40,2 --> 0:4:46,3
suggesting that president bush was gonna
kill anybody with a draft


101
0:4:46,3 --> 0:4:48,689
are only remember the harshest critics
of the


102
0:4:48,689 --> 0:4:52,109
uh... for our president bush on the
democratic side they had a drone program


103
0:4:52,109 --> 0:4:53,91
back then


104
0:4:53,91 --> 0:4:54,93
so what is it


105
0:4:54,93 --> 0:4:56,509
all of a sudden


106
0:4:56,509 --> 0:4:58,699
that this trial program


107
0:4:58,699 --> 0:5:2,46
has gotten every republican so spina


108
0:5:2,46 --> 0:5:4,49
whether we ought to hear


109
0:5:4,49 --> 0:5:9,229
people are astonished that president
obama center mccain is doing many of the


110
0:5:9,229 --> 0:5:12,11
things that president bush did


111
0:5:12,11 --> 0:5:15,169
i'm not a scottish i congratulated


112
0:5:15,169 --> 0:5:20,55
or having the good judgment understand
where war


113
0:5:20,55 --> 0:5:23,37
though i agree with the first part you
know the bombs are being hypocrites


114
0:5:23,37 --> 0:5:26,8
because they didn't someone from doing
any of this


115
0:5:26,8 --> 0:5:27,869
but then the second was like


116
0:5:27,869 --> 0:5:32,549
this is the one thing lizzie grams below
will probably have some bad briefly


117
0:5:32,549 --> 0:5:33,7
right


118
0:5:33,7 --> 0:5:36,97
he's also ya bums the woodwork
forthrightly l mama until one or more


119
0:5:36,97 --> 0:5:39,5
than one there were resolved on please
vote for me


120
0:5:39,5 --> 0:5:42,939
but on this what all he has great
judgment


121
0:5:42,939 --> 0:5:43,95
lindsey graham


122
0:5:43,95 --> 0:5:46,119
was that attorney in the military


123
0:5:46,119 --> 0:5:48,3
that was his job an attorney


124
0:5:48,3 --> 0:5:50,58
and here is turns around and says


125
0:5:50,58 --> 0:5:54,459
well president says he's a man he come
back


126
0:5:54,459 --> 0:5:57,209
well then obviously edits


127
0:5:57,209 --> 0:5:58,729
no it's not his


128
0:5:58,729 --> 0:6:0,709
that's why we have trials


129
0:6:0,709 --> 0:6:4,659
that's why it's a democracy but lindsey
graham john mccain and wrestle war


130
0:6:4,659 --> 0:6:5,699
mongers


131
0:6:5,699 --> 0:6:7,86
i've totally forgotten that


132
0:6:7,86 --> 0:6:10,18
thank god that ran paul stood up to them


133
0:6:10,18 --> 0:6:13,819
and the republican establishment and the
democratic establishment


134
0:6:13,819 --> 0:6:14,93
they've all fergan


135
0:6:14,93 --> 0:6:18,699
but the constitution sposed to be about


136
0:6:18,699 --> 0:6:20,95
and they're also smart mode


137
0:6:20,95 --> 0:6:24,559
they're not gonna give these guys and i
deleted poets


138
0:6:24,559 --> 0:6:28,99
that you and i might get put on a list
of some point somebody without power


139
0:6:28,99 --> 0:6:31,549
might get put on a list they've gotta go
on a list right


140
0:6:31,549 --> 0:6:34,91
but you'd given executive or anybody


141
0:6:34,91 --> 0:6:37,259
unlimited power


142
0:6:37,259 --> 0:6:38,199
tick tock


143
0:6:38,199 --> 0:6:39,3
ticked off


144
0:6:39,3 --> 0:6:40,52
only a matter of time


145
0:6:40,52 --> 0:6:42,4
before they start abusing that power


146
0:6:42,4 --> 0:6:44,779
there are any sort of museum abroad


147
0:6:44,779 --> 0:6:49,109
there is a wall street journal article
ironically given their editorial says


148
0:6:49,109 --> 0:6:49,879
here


149
0:6:49,879 --> 0:6:51,819
where they explain


150
0:6:51,819 --> 0:6:55,309
and the c_i_a_ and then a little
caterpillar the drone program


151
0:6:55,309 --> 0:6:58,469
and uh... they realize ever while they
were just using


152
0:6:58,469 --> 0:7:0,4
subleasing interest rates


153
0:7:0,4 --> 0:7:3,61
they had no idea who they were killing
and risk ratings so much blow back from


154
0:7:3,61 --> 0:7:9,139
the local populations that they decide
to go radon test aloo you know a bit


155
0:7:9,139 --> 0:7:13,5
you know what this continued until
people that they don't know have


156
0:7:13,5 --> 0:7:14,729
but not quite as much as before


157
0:7:14,729 --> 0:7:19,289
but exactly power would never corrupt
right


158
0:7:19,289 --> 0:7:23,99
if they're asking for a list one day all
watch them


159
0:7:23,99 --> 0:7:24,279
goal


160
0:7:24,279 --> 0:7:25,949
how


161
0:7:25,949 --> 0:7:27,86
but you know was intrigued


162
0:7:27,86 --> 0:7:30,159
that they can i mean the president


163
0:7:30,159 --> 0:7:32,899
can put anybody honest killers


164
0:7:32,899 --> 0:7:38,79
as long as he calls an enemy combatant
there is no check on him


165
0:7:38,79 --> 0:9:38,79
you've got a big damn sure you're not an
enemy combatant
