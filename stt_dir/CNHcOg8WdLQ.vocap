###0 STEVE SPANGLER: All right.
###0 So the question today is how quickly can you get the water
###3 out of the bottle.
###4 All right?
###4 It's a clever little trick.
###5 I want you to think of this as not a plastic bottle, a
###9 one-liter bottle.
###9 Pretend like it was glass, so you can't turn it over and
###12 just squeeze the water out like this.
###13 You have to let it flow.
###15 How do you get the water out of the bottle as
###17 quickly as you can?
###18 Well, take a look at this.
###19 You're pretty well limited by the fact that as the water
###22 goes down, the air goes up.
###23 You have to remember it's not an empty bottle.
###25 There's air inside the bottle.
###27 So how can we get the air to come in and the water to come
###29 out exactly at the same time?
###32 If you could, the water would come out pretty quickly.
###34 And I've got some ideas.
###36 I'm Steve Spangler.
###38 And I'm all about making science fun.
###40 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###42 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###46 experiences.
###47 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###49 affect the way people think about science.
###52 And to do that, I live by one motto.
###54 Make it big.
###55 Do it right.
###57 Give it class.
###58 
###63 Here's an idea.
###64 You could do this.
###64 If you watch very closely-- watch this.
###66 As you tip it like this, the water comes out.
###69 The air comes in.
###69 You see this?
###70 The water comes out.
###71 The air comes in.
###72 That flow is pretty good.
###73 The problem is it's not very fast.
###75 Water comes out.
###76 The air comes in.
###77 And then you just get mad, and you just do this.
###79 But still, you're limited by the fact that it exchanges.
###81 You almost want the air to come in here and the water to
###84 come out here.
###85 And I've got a solution for that, as well.
###87 Get yourself a drill.
###88 All right?
###88 So now, if you just stick a tiny hole in the side here
###92 like this--
###94 perfect.
###95 And then cover this up.
###97 Honestly, it's not a problem.
###98 Nobody will really care.
###100 Now watch this.
###101 If you turn it upside down, and you do this, watch.
###104 The air comes in.
###105 The water comes out.
###106 The air comes-- now that's pretty clever.
###109 However, you do have to carry this around whenever you want
###111 to do the little science experiment, so I would not
###114 suggest this method.
###115 There's an easier method.
###116 You just have to know something about the science.
###118 And you have to create a vortex inside the bottle.
###120 So you turn the whole thing upside down,
###122 hand here on the bottom.
###123 And you spin.
###124 And as you spin, you create this vortex inside.
###128 So as you release, the air comes up.
###130 The water comes down.
###131 The air comes up.
###132 The water comes down.
###133 And you dump the whole thing in about four seconds.
###136 So why is this little trick useful?
###139 It's not.
###139 It's just a clever little trick to do with a one- or a
###142 two-liter bottle.
###143 Or if you're a dishwasher, I guess you could empty water
###147 out of a bottle or a container very, very quickly.
###150 It was useful, however, for a man by the name of Craig
###153 Burnham back in 1964 because he invented one of the most
###156 popular science toys in the entire world.
###159 And it's called a tornado tube.
###162 Like so many good inventions, it all started with play.
###165 And so Craig was playing around in the basement.
###168 He was actually trying to make an hourglass.
###170 So he had two glass bottles, not these plastic one-liter
###173 bottles, two glass apple juice jugs.
###176 And he wanted to find a way to hook them together and to fill
###179 up, for example, with sand, so that one would flow from top
###182 to the bottom.
###183 Didn't have any sand, so he tried dirt.
###186 That's a good idea.
###187 Well, here's dirt.
###188 This is a great idea, right?
###190 So you got your dirt.
###191 Now you're just going to shake it out.
###195 This is a horrible idea.
###197 Craig knew that.
###198 That's why he had to come up with another option.
###201 This does nothing.
###203 So he had a better idea.
###205 Try using either salt or possibly sugar.
###208 See, if you fill the bottle with salt or sugar, then you
###211 don't get the clumping with the dirt.
###212 When you turn it over, you do get this great flow.
###216 The problem is mom shut this idea down real fast because
###219 it's just too expensive.
###221 So Craig came up with a simple solution, water.
###224 The problem was this.
###225 He just knew that the water would go from one bottle to
###228 the next bottle too quickly when he turned it over.
###230 At least that's what he thought.
###231 So to slow the whole process down, he used a metal washer.
###237 And the washer went right on the top of
###240 the bottle like this.
###243 And the other bottle goes right on the top.
###245 But the question is how do you keep them together.
###249 Well, Craig used radiator hose and clamps.
###252 And he was much smarter than I am.
###254 A little duct tape would be perfect.
###257 This is perfect.
###260 What you want to do is you want to just wrap the bottle
###263 up like this.
###263 So this goes here.
###265 Now you just wrap it up, because everything is better
###268 with duct tape.
###270 If it wasn't for duct tape, where would the world be?
###273 This will be perfect.
###274 Why wouldn't this work well?
###276 All right.
###277 So there you have it.
###278 The bottles are hooked together.
###279 The washer's in place.
###280 It's time for an hourglass.
###282 Just turn it upside down.
###284 Go.
###285 
###287 Go.
###288 Just go.
###290 And this is the problem he discovered.
###293 It doesn't go.
###295 See, there's something inside this bottle.
###296 Although it seems like it's empty, there's air.
###298 And the air pushes up.
###299 And the water can't get down.
###301 And again, another colossal failure.
###304 So he shook it in frustration because he was mad that the
###307 whole thing didn't work.
###308 And that's when he made the discovery that a vortex would
###311 appear inside, allowing the air to come up and the water
###314 to go down.
###314 The air to go up, the water to go down.
###317 It was the perfect little toy if you were a kid.
###321 He made a tornado in a bottle.
###323 Well, fast forward 24 years.
###325 And you get this device here called a tornado tube.
###327 It's actually a piece of plastic that has threads on
###329 either side.
###330 But the inside is the secret.
###332 See that opening right there?
###333 It looks like a washer.
###335 That's because it is.
###336 It's modeled right after the washer that he put in the
###339 first bottles.
###341 This simply goes over the top like this.
###344 The other bottle goes onto the top.
###347 And now, you have one of the most popular
###349 science toys of all times.
###351 Craig introduced this toy at the New York Toy Fair in 1988.
###355 It was an immediate success because it was great.
###357 You could just use recycled one- and two-liter bottles
###360 with a little connector to create a
###362 tornado inside of a bottle.
###364 But as you look at this, there's got to be more to do
###366 than just create a tornado or a vortex in a bottle.
###370 In fact, some people have even gone so far as to write a book
###373 about things you can do with a tornado tube.
###376 I just came across this one called Taming the Tornado
###378 Tube: 50 Weird and Wacky Things To Do With a Tornado
###381 Tube, written by Steve Spangler.
###385 Well, there's lots of ideas in the book.
###386 But I've got to show you one of my favorites, inspired by a
###389 kid who started with wanting to color the air
###391 inside of the bottle.
###392 How do you color air?
###393 It's pretty simple.
###395 Dish soap.
###396 Well, you start with a little bit of water inside and a
###399 couple drops of dish soap.
###401 And then you hook the other bottle on top.
###406 The trick here is that you have to shake it up first.
###410 Remember, her idea was to be able to see the
###413 air inside the bottle.
###414 How do you color air?
###416 You don't really color air.
###417 But you can make something to take up the space of the air.
###422 And this is what it looks like.
###424 This got me to thinking.
###426 If you can define the space where the air is, how could
###429 you color the vortex?
###430 Is there any way to be able to differentiate the
###433 vortex from the water?
###436 It's in the pantry.
###437 So the object here is just to define the difference between
###440 the water and whatever else is inside.
###442 And just turn to the--
###444 Higgins, what are you doing in here?
###445 HIGGINS: We're still shooting?
###447 I thought we were on break.
###448 STEVE SPANGLER: Just stay there.
###449 The secret, oil.
###452 I'll see you.
###455 The idea was pretty simple.
###456 Oil and water don't mix.
###458 And so if I wanted to find just the vortex, maybe I could
###461 spin oil to the top and allow that to go
###463 into the very middle.
###464 So suffice it to say, I picked up a ton of oil as I was
###468 playing with this to try to see if the oil and the water
###472 would work.
###473 
###475 See, you just turn the whole thing upside down,
###478 and you spin it.
###479 
###481 As you can see, unfortunately, this idea didn't work.
###484 The oil is too viscous.
###486 It doesn't flow down nicely.
###488 It doesn't define anything.
###490 I can't see what's going on.
###491 Maybe a different kind of oil, or this oil, or this oil.
###494 I'll save you the headache.
###496 It doesn't work.
###497 There was only one solution.
###499 And it worked really, really well.
###500 Well, the secret is oil.
###502 It's just not any oil that you'll find in your pantry.
###504 That's because it's colored lamp oil.
###507 See, I saw the lamp oil in the department store and noticed
###511 that it's about the same thickness, or has the same
###513 viscosity, as water.
###515 That was part of the problem with the other bottle there is
###516 it was clogging.
###517 It was that bubbling.
###519 And it didn't seem to work.
###520 Watch this.
###521 This is just the lamp oil at the top and the
###525 water at the bottom.
###526 It's colored.
###527 And you remember, you can't color regular oil.
###529 So you have to buy it colored.
###530 Well, watch what happens when you spin this one.
###532 
###536 You see, the lamp oil helps define the
###538 vortex in the very middle.
###540 That way, you get a defined red vortex as it
###543 works its way down.
###544 And it only cost me about $700 worth of all the oil that I
###547 experimented with to finally come up with this idea.
###550 Well, this is cool.
###551 But we need more ideas.
###553 We need 30 ideas.
###554 And you don't have a lot of time.
###555 So 30 ideas in 30 seconds.

###599 MALE SPEAKER: What am I supposed to do with this?
###602 STEVE SPANGLER: Watch the Spangler Effect to find out.
###605 Although we call it a tornado, it's not.
###607 It's just a vortex.
###608 Tornado is actually when the hot air rises, and a cold air
###611 front hits from the side.
###612 And you get these swirling winds.
###614 Even though it's not a tornado, everyone knows what
###617 you mean with these swirling winds.
###618 And firefighters actually have the same phenomenon.
###621 But they call them fire tornadoes.
###623 You can imagine in a forest fire how
###624 difficult that is to fight.
###626 But imagine a fire tornado that's created and now spreads
###629 amongst the treetops, making it super hard for
###631 firefighters to fight.
###633 We can recreate it here using just some simple
###635 things around the house.
###636 Safety first.
###638 And you know not to try this at home.
###640 Just watch the demonstration here.
###642 This sponge and a little bit of a lighter
###643 fluid goes on this.
###644 And this whole piece here is a spinning table
###647 called a Lazy Susan.
###649 Now, watch what happens.
###650 If we were to light this on fire and spin it, let's see if
###653 we can create a tornado effect.
###655 
###659 Hot air rises.
###660 We have a rotating flame.
###661 But it doesn't give us the tornado that we really need.
###664 What we really need is to simulate the winds hitting
###668 that rising hot air to cause a spinning, or
###671 that centripetal force.
###673 Now, at a science museum, they use a very large screen, for
###676 example, and a rotating table.
###679 Believe it or not, the solution here is as simple as
###681 a mesh trash can.
###684 The fuel goes down in the very center here.
###686 And now we just need to make sure that it's spinning in the
###689 very, very center to give us our vortex.
###692 That looks perfect.
###694 
###697 You see, as it spins, it catches that screen.
###700 And that screen now causes that centripetal force.
###703 And you get this beautiful fire vortex that shoots up
###706 just because of the rotation.
###708 Now you can see why this amazing vortex of fire is so
###711 difficult for firefighters to fight, because it literally
###714 can climb to the treetops, causing a fire to spread very,
###718 very quickly because of high, spinning winds
###722 and the fire tornado.
###723 With all this talk of tornadoes, I do
###725 have one more question.
###727 Will it blend?
###728 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###747 STEVE SPANGLER: Safety first.
###748 
###762 That looks pretty good.
###765 Tornado tube smoke.
###767 Don't breathe that.
###768 
###773 Well, they blend.
