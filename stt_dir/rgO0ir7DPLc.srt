1
0:0:5,95 --> 0:0:5,98
Back on the throttle, flat out through the
left over 100mph on the exit. Such a joy to


2
0:0:5,98 --> 0:0:17,29
drive this car but can it take on the Alfa
for pure driving thrills. Alfa Romeo is one


3
0:0:17,29 --> 0:0:21,779
of the most evocative names in the world of
motoring. But for the last few decades the


4
0:0:21,779 --> 0:0:26,61
firm hasn't had a sports car that lives up
to their illustrious sporting heritage but


5
0:0:26,61 --> 0:0:33,29
now they have - this car, the Alfa Romeo 4C.
With a carbon fibre chassis, dual-clutch gearbox


6
0:0:33,29 --> 0:0:39,66
and a mid-engine layout the spec sheet reads
like a super car, yet it costs less than 50K.


7
0:0:39,66 --> 0:0:43,53
But how does it compare to arguably the best
mid-engined sports car in the world - Porsche's


8
0:0:43,53 --> 0:0:49,61
Cayman. Well, in an Auto Express track battle,
let's find out. The stunningly beautiful 4C


9
0:0:49,61 --> 0:0:54,3
is a return to Alfa Romeo's sports car past.
With its carbon fibre chassis, it weights


10
0:0:54,3 --> 0:1:3,52
just 895kg while the 1.7-litre four-cylinder
turbo engine produces 270bhp and 350Nm of


11
0:1:3,52 --> 0:1:9,829
torque. Now into its second generation the
Porsche Cayman is famous for its perfect handling


12
0:1:9,829 --> 0:1:19,229
the 2.7-litre flat-six engine has 271bhp and
290Nm of torque. But it weights 1,310kg so


13
0:1:19,229 --> 0:1:32,249
that's 400kg heavier than the carbon-fibre
Alfa Romeo. So we've got a very standard Cayman,


14
0:1:32,249 --> 0:1:38,569
it's not a Cayman S just a standard Cayman.
Hasn't got an active damping system - it's


15
0:1:38,569 --> 0:1:48,429
just a very standard Cayman. The Cayman's
lovely it works on so many layers it's a fantastic


16
0:1:48,429 --> 0:1:54,109
road car, rides relatively nicely, quite comfortable
on the road so it's got that element. But


17
0:1:54,109 --> 0:2:0,999
the big question is, can it take on the Alfa
for pure driving thrill? And, so many things


18
0:2:0,999 --> 0:2:5,609
about this car just feel perfect - the second
you drive onto the circuit you just feel absolutely


19
0:2:5,609 --> 0:2:9,979
at the centre of the action. Everything's
beautifully balanced - you just feel like


20
0:2:9,979 --> 0:2:14,95
the car is pivoting around you so obviously
mid-engined, rear-wheel-drive, just absolutely


21
0:2:14,95 --> 0:2:19,989
perfect balance in the chassis. There's a
little bit of roll in the car but nothing


22
0:2:19,989 --> 0:2:25,62
bad, you know it's just such a wonderfully
well-balanced car. It's got a sports exhaust


23
0:2:25,62 --> 0:2:35,319
which is really good. Traction is amazing
- it's quite long gearing in the Cayman so,


24
0:2:35,319 --> 0:2:42,36
and the engine only really starts to sing
above 4,500RPM so on the road you can sometimes


25
0:2:42,36 --> 0:2:47,56
feel like it's a little bit out of its comfort
zone but the track when you get it working


26
0:2:47,56 --> 0:2:51,9
it really sounds amazing so that's the first
lap done, little bit of heating to the tyres.


27
0:2:51,9 --> 0:2:57,43
It's come round and you start a flying lap,
so across the line, second gear, and again


28
0:2:57,43 --> 0:3:1,61
because that gearing is quite short down the
second here, there's so much feel through


29
0:3:1,61 --> 0:3:6,859
the steering that you just always know what
the car is doing. Change of direction is amazing


30
0:3:6,859 --> 0:3:13,99
there, lots of grip as the car's loaded up
with that long long left-hander. Up to third


31
0:3:13,99 --> 0:3:18,819
gear, just over 100mph and 110 hard on the
brakes down to second gear for the corner.


32
0:3:18,819 --> 0:3:27,879
Loads of feel through the brakes, ABS doesn't
come in too hard. Third gear, amazing traction


33
0:3:27,879 --> 0:3:32,939
on the exit of that tight corner. Again, into
these higher-speed corners the control and


34
0:3:32,939 --> 0:3:39,23
the balance on the car is just - you really
feel what's going on, it's such a joy to drive


35
0:3:39,23 --> 0:3:46,42
this car. It's so beautifully balanced, sounds
great and just communicates so well. Third


36
0:3:46,42 --> 0:3:50,219
gear, high speed change of direction here.
You can feel the weight through here but,


37
0:3:50,219 --> 0:3:58,4
still, pretty amazing through there. Right
up at the top of the revs in third, down to


38
0:3:58,4 --> 0:4:9,409
second, really good brakes. Into the apex,
great traction into the last corner. Such


39
0:4:9,409 --> 0:4:15,439
a lovely car and across the line. So the Porsche
was a joy to drive and lapped the circuit


40
0:4:15,439 --> 0:4:29,19
in 1 minute 12.7 seconds the question is,
is the Alfa Romeo going to be faster? Starting


41
0:4:29,19 --> 0:4:38,89
a practice lap the first thing you notice
about the car is that it doesn't have power


42
0:4:38,89 --> 0:4:43,7
steering. Surely the reason for not having
power steering is to save weight, but also


43
0:4:43,7 --> 0:4:50,93
to give you an uninterrupted purity of steering
feel - unfortunately, the steering feel isn't


44
0:4:50,93 --> 0:4:53,97
very good. The steering really squirms around
and kicks back quite a lot. But you can't


45
0:4:53,97 --> 0:4:59,24
really feel what the front end's doing which
is a shame because the one thing you're going


46
0:4:59,24 --> 0:5:7,49
to want if you've got no power steering is
good steering feel but it's a shame. The engine's


47
0:5:7,49 --> 0:5:10,97
quite coarse, it's not a nice noise like the
six-cylinder Porsche. It does make itself


48
0:5:10,97 --> 0:5:17,97
known in the cabin but the dual-clutch gearbox
is pretty quick and perfectly suited to the


49
0:5:17,97 --> 0:5:24,54
job. The other disappointment you notice really
is the fact that the brake pedal - it's very


50
0:5:24,54 --> 0:5:31,89
strong and there's plenty of stopping power,
but there's not a lot of feel to the brake


51
0:5:31,89 --> 0:5:34,58
pedal and it's quite hard to brake progressively.
The retardation is quite grabby and it gets


52
0:5:34,58 --> 0:5:40,37
into the ABS very quickly, but the body control
around that high-speed corner is just amazing.


53
0:5:40,37 --> 0:5:45,13
There's hardly any roll in this car it does
feel like a really planted track car. So,


54
0:5:45,13 --> 0:5:50,34
let's see if that gives it the advantage against
the stopwatch. So, coming round now starting


55
0:5:50,34 --> 0:5:54,5
the lap - trying to get good traction out
of it, which is pretty good. Much shorter


56
0:5:54,5 --> 0:5:57,33
gearing than the Porsche, so we're a gear
up in some of these corners, so change the


57
0:5:57,33 --> 0:6:1,28
gear into this first corner here - really
good through there as it changes direction


58
0:6:1,28 --> 0:6:6,36
from left to right. A little bit of understeer
as you get on the power - there is a little


59
0:6:6,36 --> 0:6:10,64
bit more understeer in this car than you probably
would like and because of the fact with the


60
0:6:10,64 --> 0:6:16,71
Turbo power it's quite hard to dial the understeer
to oversteer because when you get back on


61
0:6:16,71 --> 0:6:20,87
the throttle you have the engines not on boost
and then it suddenly comes into boost. It's


62
0:6:20,87 --> 0:6:25,9
better now on the track when it's dried off,
when the track was damp that made the car


63
0:6:25,9 --> 0:6:32,39
quite edgy quite tricky. Now that it's dried
off it's pretty good and through these high


64
0:6:32,39 --> 0:6:36,93
speed corners turning and the really stiff
body control means that there's lots of grip


65
0:6:36,93 --> 0:6:49,44
and it is really planted through here. But
again just a little bit too much understeer,


66
0:6:49,44 --> 0:6:51,86
mighty through here though, little lift through
the right. Back on the throttle flat out through


67
0:6:51,86 --> 0:6:52,73
the left over 100 on the exit hard on the
brakes squirms a little bit again too much


68
0:6:52,73 --> 0:7:1,75
on the braking. Power through the gears, second
gear, third gear around to the last corner


69
0:7:1,75 --> 0:7:9,81
coming up to the line now and across the line.
Incredibly, given how different they are to


70
0:7:9,81 --> 0:7:14,66
drive this pair record an identical lap time
around our test track. That's the first time


71
0:7:14,66 --> 0:7:19,64
that's every happened - so what's going to
win our track battle? Well the Alfa is beautiful,


72
0:7:19,64 --> 0:7:25,71
has loads of grip and fantastic body control
but unfortunately it lacks the sublime chassis,


73
0:7:25,71 --> 0:7:30,74
communication and fingertip feel of the Porsche.
The Cayman is also more practical, cheaper


74
0:7:30,74 --> 0:7:35,11
and better to live with day-to-day. So, while
we love the look of the Alfa, the all-round


75
0:7:35,11 --> 0:7:39,55
abilities of the Cayman make it one of the
best sports cars money can buy - and it wins


76
0:7:39,55 --> 0:9:39,55
this track battle.
