###16 SIMON OSTROVSKY: We've seen a lot of settlers, and we've
###19 seen their settlements and their homes, but we really
###21 haven't got the Palestinian perspective at all.
###24 And apparently, the Palestinians are often
###26 attacked by settlers.
###28 So we've come to this town, Asira al-Qibliya, to get their
###30 perspective on things.
###32 This is the end of the road in this Palestinian town, so
###35 these houses here are the ones that are closest to the Jewish
###38 settlement up the hill.
###40 And they face the brunt of the attacks when the settlers come
###43 down throwing stones.
###44 And the owners of some of these houses are telling us
###46 that the Israeli army doesn't do anything about it.

###86 SIMON OSTROVSKY: He showed us videos he'd taken himself of
###88 the settler attacks where you could see youths come down
###91 from the settlement above the village to throw stones.
###95 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###98 The worst thing about it was that they were accompanied by
###101 the Israeli army, who were supposedly there to separate
###104 the two groups but were in fact doing nothing to stop the
###107 settler attack.
###109 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###110 
###115 A few weeks after we visited Asira al-Qibliya, the settler
###118 attacks resumed.
###119 But this time, two Palestinian villagers who were throwing
###123 stones and approaching Jewish youths were shot by the
###126 settlers with live ammunition during two separate attacks.
###130 Both times, the Israeli army did nothing to
###133 restrain the settlers.
###135 Fortunately though, both men survived.
###138 
###141 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###142 
###164 SIMON OSTROVSKY: The situation was obviously very tense and
###167 very dangerous, but this wasn't the only place under a
###170 fair bit of pressure.
###172 The Migron settlement is one of the few Jewish outposts
###175 that have received clear-cut court orders to be totally
###178 dismantled.
###180 This is Migron, an illegal outpost, and Israel has
###183 ordered all of this to be demolished in a few months.
###186 So it's got a bit of a Deliverance vibe going on, not
###189 so much because there's a lot of hillbillies out here but
###192 they're about to flood the valley.
###194 Migron has seen some of its structures knocked down by the
###197 Israeli authorities before, but this time, Israel's high
###201 court has ordered that the entire place be destroyed
###204 because it was illegally built on Palestinian land.
###207 
###210 It's a very unusual ruling, and most Palestinians see it
###214 as a one-off rather than a reversal of settlement policy
###217 in the West Bank.
###219 I spoke to one of the residents to find out how she
###221 felt about the impending demolition.
###224 Do you sympathize with Palestinian people who also
###228 see their houses get demolished under Israeli
###231 bulldozers?
###232 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I see it from another point of view.
###235 I think it's a different story.
###237 Here, nobody killed anyone.
###240 Israel destroying a house for Palestinians
###246 is not for no reason.
###249 Most of the times, it's because they did
###255 a very wrong thing.
###258 People killing people and other things.
###261 The story here is that the families did nothing.
###264 It's not that I don't feel sorry.
###266 I do.
###267 But I more feel sorry about my own people that sits under
###272 attacks every day, and we see it all the time.
###275 SIMON OSTROVSKY: So right now must be a really difficult
###277 time for the residents of Migron because the high court
###281 of Israel has stated pretty finally that by August, they
###285 want all of this to be demolished.
###287 Do you know what you're going to do?
###288 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: We believe that we won't be in the
###291 street, and we work with the government to find a solution
###296 for this hard situation.
###297 
###299 SIMON OSTROVSKY: It's easy to get bogged down in the legal
###301 details of the status of each individual settlement, but the
###305 important thing to remember is that while some sites face the
###308 chopping block, the total number of settlers in the West
###311 Bank has grown from just 12,000 in the early '80s to
###315 over 300,000 today.
###317 And that figure doesn't even include a further 200,000
###321 Israelis living in East Jerusalem, according to the
###324 activist group Peace Now.
###326 Many have begun asking themselves if it's even
###328 possible for a Palestinian state to emerge from a
###331 territory crisscrossed with Jewish settlements.
###334 A couple of miles down the road from Migron just across a
###337 small valley, we saw a shack with a couple of teenagers
###341 poking their head out of the door to see who we were.
###343 It turned out that the shantytown of [INAUDIBLE]
###346 was yet another unauthorized outpost.
###348 The place isn't marked on any map, but already it's been
###351 demolished and rebuilt a few times over.
###354 These kids were without any adult supervision.
###358 They told me they've named the place Strength of Zion.
###360 
###364 Wow, it's really basic.
###366 There's not even a floor.
###367 It's just the grass here.
###368 You've got holes in the roof.
###370 It's rained today.
###372 
###386 SIMON OSTROVSKY: This has been totally incredible.
###388 This is the freshest, most radical outpost that we've
###392 visited so far.
###393 The crazy thing about it is that the more you talk to
###396 these guys, the more somebody tells you that God has given
###399 them this land, that there is no two ways around it.
###402 You start to believe them and get to the point where you
###406 think a peaceful settlement is almost impossible.
###411 With so many settlements being built up on the future
###414 territory of the Palestinian state, you start to wonder if
###418 Israel is working to make the two-state solution a reality,
###421 or if it's just telling the international community what
###424 it wants to hear.
###425 The more Israelis move to the West Bank, the less viable a
###430 Palestinian state seems to be.
###433 So the real question becomes whether Palestinians will end
###436 up citizens of a greater Israel with equal rights or if
###440 they face a permanent regime of occupation.
