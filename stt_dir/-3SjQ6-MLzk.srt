Gelousie asks


2
0:0:8,38 --> 0:0:11,71
What made you decide to just do blogging and give up teaching if you loved it so much?


3
0:0:11,71 --> 0:0:13,73
Were you skeptical about it at first?


4
0:0:13,73 --> 0:0:17,58
At which point did you decide that you could actually make money from blogging?


5
0:0:17,58 --> 0:0:19,9
For some of you who are new to eatyourkimchi


6
0:0:19,9 --> 0:0:20,51
and you restarted watching our videos


7
0:0:20,51 --> 0:0:23,24
and some of you have been watching us from the beginning 


8
0:0:23,24 --> 0:0:24,46
We feel sorry for you


9
0:0:24,46 --> 0:0:25,54
Embarrassing actually...


10
0:0:25,54 --> 0:0:26,56
Our videos suck....really suck


11
0:0:26,56 --> 0:0:31,11
This is really good chance to explain it to people how we are blogging full time now


12
0:0:31,11 --> 0:0:32,1
what we were doing before, 


13
0:0:32,1 --> 0:0:33,12
and how the heck we got to this point


14
0:0:33,12 --> 0:0:33,82
YES!


15
0:0:33,82 --> 0:0:36,76
Both of us are certified as high school teachers in Canada


16
0:0:36,76 --> 0:0:38,37
and we came to Korea to be teachers as well


17
0:0:38,37 --> 0:0:40,21
But when we came here first though


18
0:0:40,21 --> 0:0:42,42
we set up a blog to show up our families what life is like in Korea


19
0:0:42,42 --> 0:0:45,14
because after all they had no idea what it was like


20
0:0:45,14 --> 0:0:46,66
and was worried about us 


21
0:0:46,66 --> 0:0:48,57
In fact, I'm sure that a lot of you planning coming to Korea


22
0:0:48,57 --> 0:0:51,21
are already experiencing these problems with your friends and families who are like,


23
0:0:51,21 --> 0:0:55,96
"Don't go!! ~~~ No water!! You can't do stuff there!!!"


24
0:0:55,96 --> 0:0:56,47
"What's KPOP?"


25
0:0:56,47 --> 0:1:0,72
So from D-1 we started to blog, just as a hobby, for ourselves and for our families


26
0:1:0,72 --> 0:1:3,14
Then something really weird happened


27
0:1:3,14 --> 0:1:3,86
Very weird...


28
0:1:3,86 --> 0:1:5,79
People started to subscribe our videos


29
0:1:5,79 --> 0:1:7,9
and we both were like


30
0:1:7,9 --> 0:1:7,91
WHY???


31
0:1:7,91 --> 0:1:9,42
WHO...WHY WOULD SOMEONE SUBSCRIBE?


32
0:1:9,42 --> 0:1:10,84
WE ARE SO BORING AND NERDY 


33
0:1:10,84 --> 0:1:12,26
WHO IS THAT PERSON??


34
0:1:12,26 --> 0:1:13,16
I DON'T UNDERSTAND...


35
0:1:13,16 --> 0:1:14,87
Coming to think of it, 4 and a half years 


36
0:1:14,87 --> 0:1:19,2
WHY ARE YOU WATCHING OUR VIDEOS??


37
0:1:19,2 --> 0:1:20,34
WE ARE SO NERDY AND WEIRD...


38
0:1:20,34 --> 0:1:22,26
DORKY.....I DON'T UNDERSTAND


39
0:1:22,26 --> 0:1:22,96
ME NIETHER


40
0:1:22,96 --> 0:1:25,7
So some of you know that part of our history 


41
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:28,31
but a lot of people don't know is that, during my 2 years of teacher in Korea 


42
0:1:28,31 --> 0:1:30,14
I had a really rough time as a teacher 


43
0:1:30,14 --> 0:1:35,71
Meemers said it was a rough time also...


44
0:1:35,71 --> 0:1:38,14
So then I thought, since we are getting in more popular 


45
0:1:38,14 --> 0:1:43,79
What if I decided to work as full-time for a year while Martina teaches for her 3rd year


46
0:1:43,79 --> 0:1:49,64
which ....


47
0:1:49,64 --> 0:1:52,17
Actually what you meant to say was that I was your sugar mama for you 


48
0:1:52,17 --> 0:1:55,9
Buy me this T-shirt!!


49
0:1:55,9 --> 0:1:58,12
Give me some money!!! I'm so hungry!!!


50
0:1:58,12 --> 0:2:2,57
Home in my pjs working on my website while my wife brings home the money


51
0:2:2,57 --> 0:2:6,41
Our website..was not actually making any money after 2years..


52
0:2:6,41 --> 0:2:12,47
It had potential ... but for those few months after I started to do this for full time


53
0:2:12,47 --> 0:2:14,51
REALLY....TOUGH TIMES...


54
0:2:14,51 --> 0:2:17,1
So the big goal for us to be were just able to work together 


55
0:2:17,1 --> 0:2:20,24
like if we were both teachers we are in separate schools but we love each other a lot 


56
0:2:20,24 --> 0:2:21,96
and we wanna be with each other all the time 


57
0:2:21,96 --> 0:2:24,69
so why don't we have a job while we can work with each other all the time


58
0:2:24,69 --> 0:2:27,1
This is really like our rookie groupy year


59
0:2:27,1 --> 0:2:29,13
We only had one salary coming in, which was my salary


60
0:2:29,13 --> 0:2:31,86
We had to pay the half the rent since you weren't a teacher anymore


61
0:2:31,86 --> 0:2:33,26
We were still paying off for our student loans 


62
0:2:33,26 --> 0:2:35,99
we would run out money by the end of the month because we had to pay our bills


63
0:2:35,99 --> 0:2:37,61
We would have no food to eat 


64
0:2:37,61 --> 0:2:40,53
Yes we were not eating for....last week of the month 


65
0:2:40,53 --> 0:2:41,96
EVERYTHING!!!


66
0:2:41,96 --> 0:2:44,49
It was our rookie group year ..so much ramen


67
0:2:44,49 --> 0:2:46,93
SO MUCH RAMEN.....


68
0:2:46,93 --> 0:2:48,34
It was a really hard year for us


69
0:2:48,34 --> 0:2:51,6
By the end of Martina's 3rd year of teaching, that was when we realized 


70
0:2:51,6 --> 0:2:53,89
"Yes, she could quit teaching, we both could live off the blog!


71
0:2:53,89 --> 0:2:57,92
Yes it was going to be more difficult because we would be cutting off her salary as a teacher as well


72
0:2:57,92 --> 0:3:1,15
But it's something we can do, we tighten our belts and can get through it!!"


73
0:3:1,15 --> 0:3:2,15
And we wouldn't eat


74
0:3:2,15 --> 0:3:5,78
And a lot of people don't realize is that, it was a really stressful 2 years for us really 


75
0:3:5,78 --> 0:3:7,7
cuz it's a risky thing to do,


76
0:3:7,7 --> 0:3:10,43
we are not on a contract, we weren't being paid monthly by someone


77
0:3:10,43 --> 0:3:14,17
It's risky, if our videos flop.. then we are not getting paid or 


78
0:3:14,17 --> 0:3:16,68
if people stop liking us and everyone unsubscribes and leaves....


79
0:3:16,68 --> 0:3:22,73
then we'll become lonely and we'll be out on the streets and have a homeless cup and we'll be really sad


80
0:3:22,73 --> 0:3:25,67
So to clarify, we are not actually hired by any company 


81
0:3:25,67 --> 0:3:27,9
the Korean government doesn't give us any money, 


82
0:3:27,9 --> 0:3:29,92
no music industry is giving us money 


83
0:3:29,92 --> 0:3:33,85
we are just working off as Youtube partnership and our own website ads


84
0:3:33,85 --> 0:3:37,38
And also this is just two of us, we don't have a PR team


85
0:3:37,38 --> 0:3:39,8
we don't have a staff of camera men or video editors,


86
0:3:39,8 --> 0:3:42,93
we don't have makeup artists, we don't have stylist , we don't have writers


87
0:3:42,93 --> 0:3:45,37
we are just two of us 


88
0:3:45,37 --> 0:3:47,38
"We can make it if we try ~~~


89
0:3:47,38 --> 0:3:49,2
JUST THE TWO OF US~~


90
0:3:49,2 --> 0:3:50,92
YOU AND I


91
0:3:50,92 --> 0:3:52,3
Don't forget about me guise~~


92
0:3:52,3 --> 0:3:53,35
Spudgy works hard also 


93
0:3:53,35 --> 0:3:55,17
Just the three of us~~


94
0:3:55,17 --> 0:3:56,18
Meemers...


95
0:3:56,18 --> 0:3:58,1
JUST THE FOUR OF US~~


96
0:3:58,1 --> 0:4:0,43
And when i decided not to return to my school for 4th year.


97
0:4:0,43 --> 0:4:2,37
it was actually really really hard for me 


98
0:4:2,37 --> 0:4:3,58
I cried and cried and cried


99
0:4:3,58 --> 0:4:6,92
and for the first 6, 7 months I'll say


100
0:4:6,92 --> 0:4:9,73
"I'm still a teacher....I'm not used to this blogging thing"


101
0:4:9,73 --> 0:4:10,85
She would keep talking about her students


102
0:4:10,85 --> 0:4:12,37
You don't have anymore students....


103
0:4:12,37 --> 0:4:15,3
YOUR STUDENTS ARE ALL DEAD...


104
0:4:15,3 --> 0:4:18,55
I didn't say that they were all dead, I'm not that mean 


105
0:4:18,55 --> 0:4:20,57
So the big question that everyone wants to know 


106
0:4:20,57 --> 0:4:21,98
"How is it possible to make money from blogging?"


107
0:4:21,98 --> 0:4:25,52
Actually this is quite simple, when you watch our videos in Youtubes


108
0:4:25,52 --> 0:4:28,74
you see like a preroll ad or ad at the bottom or ad on the side, 


109
0:4:28,74 --> 0:4:31,26
or if you visit our websites you see the ads on the side as well


110
0:4:31,26 --> 0:4:32,88
we make money for those ads


111
0:4:32,88 --> 0:4:35,71
The more people watch our videos, the more people visit our sites


112
0:4:35,71 --> 0:4:36,73
the more money we make


113
0:4:36,73 --> 0:4:41,57
Except, if you are one of those people who use ad blocks that you don't see any ads


114
0:4:41,57 --> 0:4:44,1
which we make no money whatsoever which means...


115
0:4:44,1 --> 0:4:48,46
Every time you use ad blocks, you visit our site or watch our videos


116
0:4:48,46 --> 0:4:50,29
Spudgy goes hungry 


117
0:4:50,29 --> 0:4:51,79
You want Spudgy to be hungry?


118
0:4:51,79 --> 0:4:52,51
Is that what you want?


119
0:4:52,51 --> 0:4:58,16
And especially you China, because we know that sites download our videos and re upload them 


120
0:4:58,16 --> 0:4:59,38
so we make no money out of it


121
0:4:59,38 --> 0:5:1,71
China...I've got eye on you....


122
0:5:1,71 --> 0:5:3,53
You are watching these videos for free..


123
0:5:3,53 --> 0:5:6,36
for small exchange, watch an ad at the beginning of the video


124
0:5:6,36 --> 0:5:8,19
Can you say that in more cooperate ways?


125
0:5:8,19 --> 0:5:8,49
No.. 


126
0:5:8,49 --> 0:5:11,84
Now we really appreciate of the fans support that people buy our T-Shirts 


127
0:5:11,84 --> 0:5:15,28
because that T-Shirt money goes to us and you don't had to buy those T-Shirts


128
0:5:15,28 --> 0:5:17,19
like you can keep watching those videos for free


129
0:5:17,19 --> 0:5:21,86
Those direct support of us and sites and we really appreciate that and thank you very much


130
0:5:21,86 --> 0:5:24,19
And if you guys can't afford the shirts we don't wanna put pressure on people


131
0:5:24,19 --> 0:5:26,31
Just thank you for watching our videos in general


132
0:5:26,31 --> 0:5:28,84
Just by watching our video you are giving your support that way as well,


133
0:5:28,84 --> 0:5:31,8
and Spudgy food and Meemersworth pats and kisses


134
0:5:31,8 --> 0:5:36,84
So currently we are trying to get a business visa in Korea that we could set up eatyourkimchi as a business


135
0:5:36,84 --> 0:5:38,66
and we are saving up money to apply for it


136
0:5:38,66 --> 0:5:41,18
because getting business visas is not cheap...


137
0:5:41,18 --> 0:5:44,21
and it takes a long time to apply it and we could not do it outside of Korea


138
0:5:44,21 --> 0:5:45,53
and we've been working on this for awhile


139
0:5:45,53 --> 0:5:49,18
What we are hoping to do is that actually set up a business that we could actually hire editors


140
0:5:49,18 --> 0:5:52,71
that could help us with the workload and we could maybe hire a videographer help us out as well


141
0:5:52,71 --> 0:5:54,43
It's totally awesome guys 


142
0:5:54,43 --> 0:5:57,6
We want to get more video segments for you guys


143
0:5:57,6 --> 0:5:58,28
we have so many ideas and things we wanna do,


144
0:5:58,28 --> 0:6:1,41
just don't have enough time and for those of you who edit videos


145
0:6:1,41 --> 0:6:4,86
you know that it is the most time vampire in the world!


146
0:6:4,86 --> 0:6:9,41
Like if we film one video, a WANK, it could take us like 8 hours to film 


147
0:6:9,41 --> 0:6:14,6
and then editing, that could be 6 to 10 hours, exporting and uploading it


148
0:6:14,6 --> 0:6:15,29
It could take us a day or an a half for one video


149
0:6:15,29 --> 0:6:20,96
Literally we don't have enough time in the day for one video but we do it


150
0:6:20,96 --> 0:6:24,39
So this is our very long answer to this really complicated question 


151
0:6:24,39 --> 0:6:26,13
I hope you have a better understanding what we are doing now


152
0:6:26,13 --> 0:6:30,26
You can check on our blog post on our website for more details about it


153
0:6:30,26 --> 0:6:31,68
we don't wanna just ramble on and on in this video 


154
0:6:31,68 --> 0:6:32,79
30 minutes!!


155
0:6:32,79 --> 0:6:34,31
So that's for this week's TL;DR


156
0:6:34,31 --> 0:6:37,76
If you have a question for next TL;DR, leave your question on the comment section below


157
0:6:37,76 --> 0:6:42,0
or you can check out the question that are already asked, and you can thumb them up 


158
0:6:42,0 --> 0:6:43,42
and hope we notice that question and choose it


159
0:6:43,42 --> 0:6:45,35
And don't forget to subscribe for more TL;DRs


160
0:6:45,35 --> 0:6:47,77
and not to watch us video with ad block 


161
0:6:47,77 --> 0:6:48,79
Cuz it would make us really sad 


162
0:6:48,79 --> 0:6:50,1
and Spudgy very sad


163
0:6:50,1 --> 0:6:52,2
and Meemers really sad


164
0:6:52,2 --> 0:8:52,2
HEY AD BLOCK!
