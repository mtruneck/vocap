###19 THE THREE STAGES OF TRUTH
###23 1. RIDICULE
###28 2. VIOLENT OPPOSITION
###32 3. ACCEPTANCE
###53 EARTHLINGS
###82 earth'ling: n. One who inhabits of the earth.
###91 Since we all inhabit the earth, all of us are considered earthlings.
###98 There is no sexism, no racism or speciesism in the term earthling.
###103 It encompasses each and every one of us:
###106 warm or cold blooded, mammal, vertebrate or invertebrate,
###111 bird, reptile, amphibian, fish, and human alike.
###117 Humans, therefore, being not the only species on the planet,
###120 share this world with millions of other living creatures, as we all evolve here together.
###127 However, it is the human earthling who tends to dominate the earth,
###131 often times treating other fellow earthlings and living beings as mere objects.
###136 This is what is meant by speciesism.
###138 FESTIVAL OF THE BULLS, SPAIN
###141 By analogy with racism and sexism, the term "speciesism" is a prejudice
###144 or attitude of bias in favor of the interests
###149 of members of one's own species and against those of members of other species.
###155 If a being suffers there can be no moral justification for
###157 refusing to take that suffering into consideration.
###161 No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires
###166 that one's suffering can be counted equally with the like suffering of any other being.
###187 Racists violate the principle of equality by giving greater eight
###191 to the interests of members
###193 of their own race when their is a clash between their
###197 interests and the interests of those of another race.
###206 Sexists violate the principle of equality by favoring
###210 the interests of their own sex.
###220 Similarly, speciesists allow the interests of their own species
###227 to override the greater interests of members of other species.
###235 In each case, the pattern is identical.
###246 Though among the members of the human family we recognize the moral imperative of respect
###251 (every human is a somebody, not a something),
###255 morally disrespectful treatment occurs when those who stand at the power end of a
###258 power relationship treat the less powerful as if they were mere objects.
###268 The rapist does this to the victim of rape.
###272 The child molester to the child molested.
###275 The master to the slave.
###278 In each and all such cases, humans who have power exploit those who lack it.
###285 Might the same be true of how humans treat other animals, or other earthlings?
###294 Undoubtedly there are differences,
###296 since humans and animals are not the same in all respects.
###303 But the question of sameness wears another face.
###309 Granted, these animals do not have all the desires we humans have;
###315 granted, they do not comprehend everything we humans comprehend;
###320 nevertheless, we and they do have some of the same desires
###322 and do comprehend some of the same things.
###326 The desires for food and water, shelter and companionship,
###331 freedom of movement and avoidance of pain?
###334 these desires are shared by nonhuman animals and human beings.
###342 As for comprehension: like humans,
###344 many nonhuman animals understand the world in which they live and move.
###349 Otherwise, they could not survive.
###354 So beneath the many differences, there is sameness.
###360 Like us, these animals embody the mystery and wonder of consciousness.
###366 Like us, they are not only in the world, they are aware of it.
###371 Like us they are the psychological centers of a life that is uniquely their own.
###378 In these fundamental respects humans stand "on all fours", so to speak,
###382 with hogs and cows, chickens and turkeys.
###386 What these animals are due from us, how we morally ought to treat them,
###390 are questions whose answer begins with the recognition of our
###394 psychological kinship with them.
###398 So the following film demonstrates
###400 in five ways just how animals have come to serve mankind
###405 ...lest we forget.
###420 Nobel Prize winner Isaac Bashevis Singer wrote in his bestselling novel
###425 'Enemies, A Love Story' the following:
###428 "As often has Herman had witnessed the slaughter of animals and fish,
###433 he always had the same thought: in their behavior toward creatures,
###437 all men were Nazis. The smugness with which man could do with other species
###442 as he pleased exemplified the most extreme racist theories,
###446 the principle that might is right".
###452 The comparison here to the holocaust is both intentional and obvious:
###457 one group of living beings anguishes beneath the hands of another.
###463 Though some will argue the suffering of animals cannot possibly compare
###466 with that of former Jews or slaves, there is, in fact, a parallel.
###472 And for the prisoners and victims of this mass murder, their holocaust
###478 is far from over.
###497 In his book 'The Outermost House' author Henry Beston wrote
###502 "We need another and a wiser and perhaps a more mystical
###506 concept of animals.
###510 Remote from universal nature, and living by complicated artifice,
###514 man in civilization surveys
###516 the creatures through the glass of his knowledge
###521 and sees thereby a feather magnified and the whole image in distortion.
###526 We patronize them for their incompleteness,
###529 for their tragic fate of having taken form so far below ourselves.
###535 And therein we err, and greatly err.
###539 For the animal shall not be measured by man.
###544 In a world older and more complete than ours
###548 they move finished and complete,
###553 gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained,
###562 living by voices we shall never hear.
###571 They are not brethren; they are not underlings;
###577 they are other nations,
###580 caught with ourselves in the net of life and time,
###585 fellow prisoners of the splendor and travail of the earth".
###596 PART ONE: PETS
###601 For most of us, our relationship with animals involves the owning of a pet or two.
###607 So where do our pets come from?
###612 Of course, one of the most obvious ways animals serve man is as companions.
###620 BREEDERS
###622 For these pets it starts with a breeder, though not all breeders are considered professional.
###628 In fact, in this profession, just about anyone and everyone can be a breeder.
###632 PET STORES AND PUPPY MILLS
###636 For pet stores, most of their animals are acquired from puppy mills,
###641 even if they may not know it.
###647 Puppy mills are low-budget
###649 commercial enterprises that breed dogs for sale to pet shops and other buyers.
###664 They are often backyard operations
###667 that expose animals to filthy, overcrowded conditions with no veterinary care or socialization.
###678 Dogs from puppy mills often exhibit
###680 physical and psychological problems as they grow up.
###688 STRAYS
###690 Strays, if they are lucky, will be picked up and taken to a
###694 shelter or pound, where they can only hope to find a new home again.
###705 An estimated 25 million animals become homeless every year.
###713 And as many as 27% of purebred dogs are among the homeless.
###731 Of these 25 million homeless animals an average of 9 million
###735 die on the streets from disease,
###738 starvation,
###742 exposure,
###746 injury, or some other hazard of street life.
###751 Many others are strays, some of whom were presumably dumped in the streets by their caretakers
###756 The remaining 16 million die in pounds or shelters that have no
###761 room for them and are forced to kill them.
###771 Sadly, on top of all this,
###773 almost 50% of the animals brought to shelters are turned in by their caretakers.
###782 Many people claim they don't visit shelters because it's depressing for them.
###788 But the reason animals are crowded into such dreary places as these,
###793 is because of people's refusal to spay or neuter their pets.
###799 Several pet owners feel, particularly men for some reason,
###803 that neutering a pet emasculates the owner somehow ...
###809 ... or they may just want their children to someday experience the "miracle of life", so to speak.
###826 In either case, pet owners like these unknowingly take part in the euthanasia
###831 of over 60,000 animals per day.
###837 Euthanasia, generally defined as the act of killing painlessly for reasons of mercy,
###843 is usually administered by an injection in the leg for dogs,
###848 and sometimes in the stomach for cats.
###857 It is a quick and painless procedure for the animals, and by far the most humane,
###864 but not always the most affordable.
###870 Due to the increase of euthanasia in shelters,
###873 and the growing, constant, demand for drugs like Euthasol,
###878 some shelters with budget constraints are forced to use gas chambers instead.
###887 GAS CHAMBERS
###888 In a gas chamber, animals are packed very tightly
###892 and can take as long as 20 minutes to die.
###907 It is, by far, less merciful,
###911 more traumatic and painful.
###914 But the procedure is less expensive.
###925 Perhaps some of the tough questions we should ask ourselves about animals
###929 that we keep as companions are:
###933 Can we keep animals as companions and still address their needs?
###937 Is our keeping companion animals in their best interest,
###940 or are we exploiting them?
###943 The answers to these questions may lie in the attitudes of the human caretakers
###948 and their abilities to provide suitable environments for companion animals.
###981 (CYANIDE POISON) Most human beings are speciesists.
###984 This film shows that ordinary human beings (not a few exceptionally
###988 cruel or heartless humans, but the overwhelming majority of people),
###992 take an active part in, acquiesce in, and allow their taxes
###996 to pay for practices that require the sacrifice of the most important
###1000 interests of members of other species, in order to promote the most
###1004 trivial interests of our own species.
###1009 STRAY OVERPOPULATION IN TURKEY
###1020 The hope for the animals of tomorrow is
###1022 to be found in a Human Culture which learns to feel beyond itself.
###1036 We must learn empathy,
###1043 we must learn to see into the eyes
###1045 of an animal and feel that their life has value because they are alive.
###1065 PART TWO: FOOD
###1071 "Oh, I missed. I missed you, honey. But I'll get you again!"
###1084 "I got you! Good boy!"
###1091 What happens in slaughterhouses
###1093 is a variation on the theme of the exploitation of the weak by the strong.
###1112 More than ten thousand times a minute,
###1115 in excess of six billion times a year, just in the United States,
###1119 life is literally drained from so-called "food animals".
###1124 Having the greater power, humans decide when these animals will die,
###1129 where they will die,
###1130 and how they will die.
###1133 The interests of these animals themselves
###1135 play no role whatsoever in the determination of their fate.
###1141 Killing an animal is, in itself, a troubling act.
###1145 It has been said that if we had
###1147 to kill our own meat, we would all be vegetarians.
###1151 Certainly very few people ever visit a slaughterhouse,
###1154 and films of slaughterhouse operations are not popular on television.
###1159 People might hope that the meat they buy came from an animal who died without pain,
###1164 but they don't really want to know about it.
###1167 Yet those who, by their purchases, require animals to be killed,
###1172 do not deserve to be shielded from this or any other aspect of the production
###1177 of the meat they buy.
###1179 So where does our food come from?
###1184 For those of us living on a meat diet, the process these animals
###1189 undergoes is as follows.
###1192 BRANDING
###1197 For beef, the animals are all branded ...
###1201 ... in this instance, on the face.
###1207 DEHORNING
###1210 Dehorning usually follows. Never with anesthetic.
###1214 But rather a large pair of pliers.
###1232 TRANSPORTATION
###1236 In transportation, animals are packed so tightly into trucks, they are
###1240 practically on top of one another.
###1242 Heat, freezing temperatures, fatigue, trauma, and health conditions
###1247 will kill some of these animals in route to the slaughterhouses.
###1251 MILKING
###1254 Milking cows are kept chained
###1256 to their stalls all day long, receiving no exercise.
###1261 Pesticides and antibiotics are also used to increase their milk productivity.
###1282 Eventually, milking cows, like this one, collapse from exhaustion.
###1289 Normally, cows can live as long as twenty years,
###1292 but milking cows generally die within four.
###1297 At which point, their meat is used for fast food restaurants.
###1302 MEAT
###1308 At this slaughterhouse,
###1310 the branded and dehorned cattle are brought into a stall.
###1314 CAPTIVE BOLTS
###1317 The captive bolt gun, which was designed
###1319 to reduce animals unconscious without causing pain,
###1324 fires a steel bolt, that is powered by compressed air or a blank cartridge,
###1329 right into the animal's brain.
###1332 BLEEDING
###1336 Though various methods of slaughter are used, in this Massachusetts facility,
###1342 the cattle is hoisted up and his or her throat is slit.
###1347 Along with the meat, their blood will be used as well.
###1362 Though the animal has received a captive bolt to the head,
###1366 which is supposed to have rendered him
###1368 or her senseless ... as you can see the animal is still conscious.
###1374 This is not uncommon.
###1377 Sometimes they are still alive even after they have been bled,
###1381 and are well on their way down the assembly line to be butchered.
###1392 KNOCKING BOXES
###1432 KOSHER SLAUGHTER
###1437 This is the largest glatt kosher meat plant in the United States.
###1441 Glatt, the Yiddish word for "smooth", means the highest standard of cleanliness ...
###1452 ... and rules for kosher butchering require minimal suffering.
###1464 The use of electric prods on immobilized animals is a violation.
###1472 SHEKHITA - RITUAL SLAUGHTER
###1476 Inverting frightened animals for the slaughterer's convenience
###1480 is also a violation.
###1488 The inversion process causes cattle to aspirate blood, or breath it in, after incision.
###1499 Ripping the trachea and esophagi from their throats is another
###1503 egregious violation, since kosher animals are not to be touched ...
###1507 ... until bleeding stops.
###1523 And by dumping struggling and dying steers through metal chutes
###1527 onto blood soaked floors,
###1530 with their breathing tubes and gullets dangling out,
###1538 this "sacred task" is neither clean or compassionate.
###1546 Shackling and hoisting is ruled yet another violation,
###1550 nor does it correspond to the kosher way of treating animals.
###1556 If this was kosher, death was neither quick nor merciful.
###1563 VEAL
###1565 Veal, taken from their mothers within two days of birth, are tied
###1570 at the neck and kept restricted to keep muscles from developing.
###1575 Fed an iron-deficient liquid diet,
###1578 denied bedding, water, and light,
###1582 after four months of this miserable existence they are slaughtered.
###1586 PIGS
###1592 Sows in factory farms are breeding machines, kept
###1595 continually pregnant by means of artificial insemination.
###1600 Large pig market factories will "manufacture",
###1604 as they like to call it, between 50,000 and 600,000 pigs a year... each.
###1611 FACTORY CONDITIONS
###1630 GESTATION CRATES
###1641 RUPTURES & ABSCESSES
###1658 CANIBALISM
###1685 WASTE PITS
###1710 Tail docking is a practice derived from the lack of space and stressful
###1715 living conditions so as to keep pigs from biting each other's tails off.
###1721 This is done without anesthetic.
###1724 EAR CLIPPING
###1727 Ear clipping is a similar procedure, also administered without anesthetic.
###1743 As well as teeth-cutting.
###1765 CASTRATION
###1768 Castration is also done without painkillers or anesthetic, and will
###1773 supposedly produce a more fatty grade of meat.
###1786 ELECTRIC PRODS
###1789 The electric prods are used for obvious reasons: handling.
###1821 ELECTROCUTION
###1825 Electrocution is another method of slaughter, as seen here.
###1834 THROAT SLITTING
###1836 Throat slitting, however,
###1838 is still the least expensive way to kill an animal.
###1865 BOILING AND HAIR REMOVAL
###1871 After knife sticking, pigs are shackled,
###1875 suspended on a bleed-rail and immersed in scalding tanks to remove their bristle.
###1881 Many are still struggling as they are dunked upside down in tanks of steaming water,
###1887 where they are submerged and drowned.
###1927 POULTRY
###1931 In regard to poultry, Americans currently consume as much chicken in a single day
###1937 as they did in an entire year in 1930.
###1944 The largest broiler companies in the world now slaughter more than
###1949 8.5 million birds in a single week.
###1963 DEBEAKING
###1969 Debeaking prevents feather-pecking and cannibalism in frustrated chickens,
###1973 caused by over-crowding in single areas, where they are unable to establish a social order.
###1986 Today, done with infant chicks, the procedure is carried out very quickly,
###1991 about 15 birds a minute.
###1994 Such haste means the temperature and sharpness of the blade varies, resulting in
###2000 sloppy cutting and serious injury to the bird.
###2004 LIVING CONDITIONS
###2006 As for their living conditions, anywhere from sixty to ninety thousand birds can be
###2011 crowded together in a single building.
###2025 The suffering for these animals is unrelenting. It is a way of life.
###2031 Although their beaks are severed, they attempt to peck each other.
###2041 For hens, they live in a laying warehouse, crammed inside so-called "battery cages".
###2050 BATTERY CAGES
###2053 Many lose their feathers and develop sores from rubbing against the wire cage.
###2063 Crowding prevents them from spreading their wings, and the hens cannot
###2068 even fulfill minimal natural instincts.
###2072 TRANSPORTATION
###2074 During transportation, all animals suffer, and many die.
###2081 And they suffocate when other animals pile on top of them
###2085 in overcrowded, poorly loaded cages.
###2090 SLAUGHTER
###2096 "THE HANG PEN" MOOREFIELD, WEST VIRGINIA
###2130 Chickens and turkeys are slaughtered in numerous ways.
###2135 Some may be clubbed to death or have their heads cut off.
###2151 But most are brought through the assembly lines of factory farms.
###2161 Dangled upside down on a conveyor belt, their throats are slit,
###2166 and they are left to bleed to death.
###2177 Others may be placed head-first in tubes to restrict their movement
###2181 while they slowly bleed to death.
###2187 Surely, if slaughterhouses had glass walls, would not all of us be vegetarians?
###2194 But slaughterhouses do not have glass walls.
###2197 The architecture of slaughter is opaque, designed in the interest of denial,
###2201 to insure that we will not see even if we wanted to look. And who wants to look?
###2206 "Go mother fucker! Don't fuckin' stop".
###2218 "Let's go, let's go!!! Come on, bitch!"
###2236 It was Emerson who observed, more than a hundred years ago,
###2240 "You have dined, and however scrupulously the slaughterhouse is concealed in
###2245 the graceful distance of miles, there is complicity".
###2295 SEA FOOD
###2301 And for those who think eating seafood is "healthier" than land animals,
###2306 just remember how much irretrievable waste and contaminated sediments
###2310 are dumped into our oceans.
###2313 In the past ... oil ... nuclear ... and chemical industries have done little for the
###2318 protection of marine environments ...
###2321 ... and dumping on or under the seabed has always proved a convenient place
###2328 to dispose of inconvenient wastes.
###2336 COMMERCIAL FISHING
###2342 Today's commercial fishers intensify this situation on massive scales.
###2348 They use vast factory trawlers the size of
###2351 football fields and advanced electronic equipment to track and catch fish.
###2360 Huge nets stretch across the ocean, swallowing up everything in their path.
###2366 These factory trawlers, coupled with our increased appetites for seafood,
###2371 are emptying the oceans of sea life at an alarming pace.
###2381 Already, thirteen of the seventeen major global fisheries are depleted or in serious decline.
###2388 The other four are overexploited or fully exploited.
###2392 DISEASE
###2400 The recent outbreak of Pfiesteria,
###2402 a microorganism 1,000 time more potent than cyanide,
###2406 spawned from millions of gallons of raw hog feces and urine, poured into rivers,
###2412 lakes, and oceans, turning their ecosystems into unflushed toilets,
###2416 is proving the most alarming.
###2421 Threatening sea life and humans alike, Pfiesteria has killed over 1 billion fish,
###2426 the southeast's largest fishkill on record,
###2430 and it's spreading.
###2434 Traces of Pfiesteria have already been found from Long Island to the Florida Gulf,
###2440 at distances of up to 1,000 miles.
###2443 In fact, this water-based Pfiesteria invasion
###2446 stands as one of the worst outbreaks of a virulent microorganism in U.S history.
###2452 It is a Level Three Biohazard. Ebola is a Four. AIDS is a two.
###2460 And this bug mutated as a direct result of our mass consumption of animals,
###2465 particularly pork.
###2469 With hog farms fattening millions of pigs for slaughter, grain goes in and waste comes out.
###2476 HURRICANE FLOYD NORTH CAROLINA, 1999
###2480 This waste finds its way into our oceans and water-supply systems,
###2483 contaminating the animals that live in it,
###2487 as well as those that eat from it.
###2492 WHALING
###2498 Finally, whaling.
###2500 Though the International Whaling Commission prohibited commercial whaling in 1985,
###2505 many countries continue to kill whales for their so-called "exotic meat".
###2521 They use harpoons,
###2524 firearms,
###2526 blunt hooks,
###2529 even explosives,
###2532 or drive them into authorized whaling bays
###2535 where they are made to beach and can be killed with knives in the shallows.
###2565 DOLPHINS
###2571 Every winter, between the months of October through March, thousands of dolphins are
###2577 confined and brutally killed in small towns across Japan.
###2586 Sounding rods beneath the water's surface interfere with the dolphin's sonar.
###2596 Once disoriented and enclosed within the nets, the dolphins panic.
###2606 Fisherman often injure a few captive dolphins with a spear thrust or knife slash ...
###2611 since dolphins never abandon wounded family members.
###2618 Mothers and babies call out in distress as they are separated,
###2622 hoisted up and dragged off ... soon to be mercilessly hacked to death.
###2636 these are benign and innocent beings ...
###2641 ... and they deserve better.
###2681 Yet here, as they lay stricken and needful,
###2684 wreathing helplessly on cement floors, they are cut open with machetes
###2690 and left to slowly suffocate ...
###2703 ... convulsing and contorting in the throes of agony ... while school children walk on by.
###2727 Such images of slaughter and bloody red water clearly show the Japanese government has
###2732 little respect for the state of the world's oceans with their inhumane methods of
###2737 fishing ... often in violation of international treaties, laws and conventions designed
###2742 to protect over-exploiting the oceans ...
###2745 ... and the creatures that live in them.
###2751 Dolphin meat is later sold in markets and restaurants,
###2755 though often mislabeled as "whale meat".
###2761 But as though cruelty toward animals raised for food wasn't enough,
###2766 we've also found ways of making use of them for all our clothes.
###2771 Jackets, shoes, belts, gloves, pants, wallets, purses, and so on,
###2777 the next question is obviously: where do our clothes come from?
###2781 PART TREE: CLOTHES
###2796 (LEATHER)
###2796 The demand for leather comes primarily from the United States, Germany, and the U.K.
###2802 Just about everybody wears it,
###2805 with little or no thought of where it came from.
###2808 (INDIA COWS)
###2809 Thousands of India cows are slaughtered each week for their skins,
###2813 purchased from poor families in part of rural India who sell them
###2817 only after the assurance that the animals will live out their lives on farms.
###2822 SHOEING AND ROPING
###2833 To relocate the animals to a state where they can legally be killed,
###2835 since cattle slaughter is forbidden in most of India,
###2839 the animals must be shoed and roped together in preparation for a harrowing "death march",
###2844 which could last for several days.
###2854 (TRANSPORTATION AND FATIGUE)
###2856 Forced to walk through the heat and dust without food or water, coupled with the sheer stress of
###2860 this terrifying experience for them, many of the animals collapse and are unable to continue.
###2868 Bear in mind that most of the cattle are being placed in a truck for the first time in
###2873 their lives and are likely to be frightened,
###2875 especially if they have been handled hastily or roughly by the men loading the trucks.
###2879 The noise and motion of the truck itself
###2881 is also a new experience; one which makes them ill.
###2885 After one or two days inside the truck without food or water, they are desperately thirsty
###2890 and hungry, especially since it is normal for such cows to eat frequently throughout the day.
###2895 TAIL BREAKING
###2904 But when the cattle become weary and grow faint, the bones in their tales are broken in
###2909 an effort to get them back up on their feet.
###2914 This is done by repeatedly pinching the tail in several areas.
###2919 HANDLERS
###2928 Handlers must constantly keep the cattle moving,
###2931 pulling them by nose ropes,
###2933 twisting their necks,
###2935 horns, or tails.
###2939 They lead, or rather force,
###2941 the cattle down embankments and in and out of trucks without ramps,
###2945 causing injuries like broken pelvises, legs, ribs, and horns.
###2958 CHILI PEPPER
###2961 Chili pepper and tobacco are also used to keep the animals walking.
###2966 This practice is done by rubbing the pepper directly into their eyes, in order to stimulate
###2972 the animal back onto his or her feet.
###2979 SLAUGHTER
###2989 And all this before the slaughter.
###2993 As many as half of the animals will already be dead by the time they
###2997 arrive at the slaughterhouse.
###3017 But to make the experience even more traumatic and terrifying, they are
###3022 often killed in full view of each other.
###3025 And instead of the required "quick slice" across the throat with a sharp knife,
###3030 they are generally killed through hacking and sawing with a dull blade.
###3050 TANNING
###3055 Afterwards, the skins from these animals are sent to tanneries that use deadly
###3060 substances like Chromium and other toxins to stop decomposition.
###3065 Remember, leather is dead flesh.
###3070 It is dead skin, and, therefore, natural for it to decompose and rot away unless treated
###3076 with such potent substances as these.
###3080 And for people, the health effects of such chemicals in tanneries, in lieu of the
###3085 continued demand for leather goods, is yet another issue.
###3090 RETAIL
###3097 Ultimately, leather from Indian cattle make their way to clothing stores
###3102 all around the world.
###3115 Most major chains sell Indian leather ...
###3120 ... leather that comes from completely different cows than those we eat.
###3126 FUR
###3129 And what about fur?
###3131 Over 100 million wild animals are murdered
###3134 for their pelts every year, 25 million in the United States alone.
###3139 These animals, obtained by hunting and trapping, are kept on fur farms in conditions like these.
###3145 CAGE MADNESS
###3149 Naturally, these undomesticated, wild animals are not accustomed to being caged,
###3156 and cage madness develops when frightened and frustrated animals are driven crazy
###3161 from the stress of confinement.
###3166 These wild, free-roaming animals,
###3168 and their offspring, find themselves unable to live a natural life,
###3172 can never take even a few steps or feel the earth beneath their feet.
###3179 Instead, they are reduced to scratching, circling and pacing endlessly.
###3184 (INJURIES AND SLOW DEATH)
###3186 The physical injuries these animals endure on fur farms ...
###3189 involve broken and exposed bones ...
###3196 ... blindness ...
###3201 ... ear infections ...
###3203 ... dehydration and malnutrition ...
###3205 ... exposure to freezing temperatures ...
###3209 ... lack of veterinary care ...
###3212 ... and slow death.
###3222 (KILLING)
###3224 No laws indicate the killing of animals on fur farms, therefore,
###3227 the least expensive methods are the most appealing.
###3231 Carbon monoxide poisoning, Strychnine, suffocation,
###3236 breaking the neck, and anal electrocution are some of the more common methods used.
###3243 Removed from his or her cage with a heavy neck-pole, the animal is walked past
###3249 the rows of bodies of slaughtered foxes, sables, raccoons and wolves, among others.
###3257 Death by anal electrocution is a crude process that requires a probe to be inserted
###3262 in the rectum while the animal bites down on a metal conductor.
###3274 Often times this inept procedure must be repeated to actually kill the animal.
###3293 And the skinned carcasses seen here will later be ground up and fed to the animals still caged.

###3334 CANADIAN SEAL HUNT
###3388 - How much is this one?
###3391 - This is... $49,500
###3396 PART FOUR: ENTERTAINMENT
###3399 And so we move on to entertainment.
###3404 Mark Twain once said,
###3407 "Of all the creatures ever made he (man) is the most detestable.
###3413 He's the only creature that inflicts pain for sport, knowing it to be pain".
###3422 RODEOS
###3425 In rodeos, bulls and broncos don't buck because they're wild, but because they're in pain.
###3431 A belt, called a flank strap or a bucking strap, is secured around
###3434 the animal's body over the genital area.
###3438 As the animal leaves the chute, a tight jerk on the belt is enough
###3441 to start him bucking in pain.
###3448 Apart from other injuries animals incur at rodeos ...
###3452 ... such as broken legs ...
###3457 ... they are also worked up by being slapped ...
###3461 ... teased ...
###3462 ... given electric prods ...
###3465 ... and otherwise tormented ...
###3467 ... to bolt out of the chute in a frenzy.
###3515 ROPING
###3524 Roping, as seen here, involves throwing a rope around the neck of a frightened animal running
###3530 full speed, jerking the poor creature to a halt, and slamming him or her to the ground.
###3549 GAMBLING
###3551 Like any other business, dog racing and horse racing are industries motivated
###3554 by a common denominator:
###3557 profit.
###3568 FAIR GROUNDS
###3570 At fair grounds across the country, animals are used to race,
###3576 bet with, and spectate over.
###3580 Training for these events is accomplished by withholding food and sometimes water.
###3585 These animals ... unfamiliar with their surroundings ... the noise ... the crowds ...
###3590 even what they're supposed to be doing ... are all-too-often injured and discarded ...
###3600 (PIGEON BOWLING) in pointless ... trivial ... outlandish contests ... designed to make profits and entertain.
###3607 HUNTING
###3611 Besides loss of habitat, hunting is the number one threat to wildlife today.
###3617 Hunters kill over 200 million animals every year.
###3621 Deer, rabbits, and squirrels top the list of desirable targets.
###3629 There is no denying it, if hunting is a sport it is a bloodsport.
###3634 The targets are living,
###3637 and they undergo violent deaths.
###3651 FISHING
###3653 Fishing is also a death sport, wherein the nonhuman animal suffers.
###3661 Researchers have distinguished that fish show pain behavior the same way mammals do.
###3668 Anatomically, physiologically,
###3672 and biologically, the pain system in fish is virtually the same as in birds and mammals.
###3678 In other words, fish are sentient organisms,
###3681 so of course they feel pain.
###3692 For those who think fish die
###3695 "gentler" deaths, consider that their sensory organs are highly developed,
###3699 their nervous systems complex, their nerve cells very similar to our own,
###3705 and their responses to certain stimuli immediate and vigorous.
###3712 CIRCUSES
###3718 When going to the circus, rarely do we stop for a moment and consider:
###3724 What incites an animal to do something unnatural, even dangerous, such as jumping through
###3729 flames, balancing on one foot, or diving into water from shaky platforms high in the air?
###3747 Animal trainers would like for the public to
###3750 believe that animals are coaxed into such behaviors with the promise of rewards.
###3759 But the truth is that animals perform because they fear punishment.
###3776 In essence, circuses condemn animal
###3781 who are wild by nature to live out their days isolated in tiny, barren cages,
###3786 denied normal exercise and socialization,
###3793 shuttled around from place to place,
###3798 WINTER QUARTERS
###3804 and shackled in chains for up to 95% of their lives.
###3812 TRAINING
###3816 "Elephants are taught to perform with positive reinforcement, and never hit".
###3821 "Never hit. Never, never, never
###3827 will you see anyone use the ankus as anything other than a guide or a tool".
###3849 Dominance, subservience, and pain are integral parts of the training process.
###3885 - Hurt him. Don't touch him!
###3888 Make him scream!
###3889 If you're scared to hurt him, don't come in this room.
###3894 When I say rip his fuckin' --- you know how I am about touchin' him, right?
###3898 So if I say rip his head off ... rip his fuckin' foot off, what does that mean?
###3902 Because it's very important to do it, right? When he starts squirming too fuckin' much -
###3905 both fuckin' hands - BOOM! Right under that chin!
###3909 Sit ... and he better back up.
###3911 Then when he fucks around too much, don't grab that leg ...
###3914 ... you fuckin' sink that hook and give everything you've got ... and when it's in there go, ee-eeee-ee!!!
###3919 And he's gonna start screaming.
###3921 When you hear that screaming, then you know you've got their attention a little fuckin' bit!
###3927 Right here in the barn. Can't do it on the road.
###3931 She's gonna fuckin' do what I want. And that's just the fuckin' way it is.
###3936 Alright, let's go.
###3938 Becky! Becky!!!
###3943 You motherfucker.
###3946 Get your motherfuckin' --- get up here!
###3950 Motherfucker!
###3953 Come here, Becky.
###3956 Move up, Becky.
###3959 Move up, Becky.
###3963 Alright, tubs.
###3965 Tubs!
###3969 Hey, get loony.
###3971 Hey, Becky. Go on, move up.
###3973 Hey, I'm alive.
###3974 I'm not a dead man.
###3975 Move up.
###3977 Come in line.
###3978 Come in line, Becky.
###3980 Motherfucker!
###3982 Move, motherfucker!
###3987 Yeah, come in line. Come here, Tommy.
###3991 Why do they have to go through that because you motherfuckers don't want to listen?
###4001 Back up.
###4002 You got a pussy-ass fuckin' attitude, it's just the way they die.
###4015 We know animals feel.
###4021 They feel fear, loneliness, and pain, just like humans do.
###4028 What animal would choose to spend their entire life in captivity ...
###4032 ... if they had a choice?
###4035 RETALIATION
###4112 - On the count of three.
###4114 One.
###4115 Two.
###4117 Tree.
###4118 Take him. You've got to shoot.
###4147 ZOOS
###4151 Are zoos valuable educational and conservation institutions?
###4157 Sure, zoos are interesting, but they are only educational in the sense that they
###4161 teach a disregard for the natures of other living beings.
###4168 Besides, what can we learn about wild animals by viewing them in captivity?
###4176 Zoos exist because we are intrigued by exotic things,
###4181 and to zoo-goers, zoo animals are just that: things.
###4189 In both cases, at circuses or zoos,
###4193 wild and exotic animals are captured, caged,
###4197 transported and trained ... to do what humans want them to do.
###4206 BULLFIGHTING
###4209 At best, the term "bullfighting" is a misnomer,
###4213 as there is little competition between the sword of a nimble matador
###4217 (which is Spanish for killer),
###4220 and a confused, maimed, psychologically tormented, and physically debilitated bull.
###4229 Many prominent former bullfighters report
###4232 that bulls are intentionally debilitated with tranquilizers and laxatives,
###4236 beatings to the kidneys, and heavy weights hung around their necks for weeks before a fight.
###4246 Some of the animals are placed in darkness for 48 hours before the confrontation,
###4252 then are released blinded into the bright arena.
###4258 In a typical event, the bull enters and is approached by men who exhaust and
###4263 frustrate him by running him in circles and tricking him into collisions.
###4270 When the bull is tired and out of breath,
###4273 he is approached by picadors, who drive lances into his back and neck muscles,
###4279 twisting and gouging to ensure a significant amount of blood loss,
###4283 and impairing the bull's ability to lift his head.
###4288 Then come the banderilleros
###4291 who distract and dart around the bull while plunging more lances into him.
###4298 Weakened from blood loss,
###4301 they run the bull in more circles until he is dizzy and stops chasing.
###4306 Finally, the matador, this "killer", appears and, after provoking a few exhausted
###4311 charges from the dying animal, tries to kill the bull with his sword.
###4320 And this bloody form of amusement ... is bullfighting.
###4326 The pleasure derived from all these activities and sports
###4331 (a communion with nature, some would say),
###4334 can be secured without harming or killing animals.
###4339 The commercial exploitation of wildlife erroneously assumes that the value of wild
###4343 animals is reducible to their utility relative to human interests,
###4348 especially economic interests.
###4352 But wild animals are not a renewable resource, having value only relative to human interests.
###4363 That perception can only be that of a speciesist.
###4372 (SEAL HARVEST, ST. PAUL ISLAND) Nevertheless, these practices exist
###4375 only because we do not take seriously the interests of other animals.
###4385 In this light, are humans not the most callous speciesists of all?
###4393 PART FIVE: SCIENCE
###4401 VIVISECTION
###4403 The term vivisection is used to apply to all types of experiments
###4407 on living animals and is said to be a form of medical science.
###4414 The reason for experimentation of this
###4416 type is to allegedly discover cures for human ailments and illnesses.
###4424 But those who hope to find remedies for human ills by inflicting deliberate
###4428 sufferings on animals commit two fundamental errors in understanding.
###4433 The first is the assumption
###4435 that results obtained on animals are applicable to mankind.
###4440 The second concerns the inevitable
###4442 fallacy of experimental science in respect to the field of organic life.
###4448 Since animals react differently from human beings ... every new product
###4452 or method tried out on animals must be tried
###4455 out again on man ... through careful clinical tests, before it can be considered safe.
###4463 This rule knows no exceptions.
###4466 Tests on animals are not only dangerous because they lead to wrong conclusions
###4471 but, furthermore, they retard clinical investigation -
###4475 which is the only valid kind.
###4479 Just remember the fact that any disease
###4482 deliberately provoked is unlike any disease that arises spontaneously.
###4488 MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS
###4491 Unfortunately, such methods still sail today
###4494 under the flag of science
###4496 - which is an insult to true science, as well as human intelligence.
###4514 And so vivisection applies to medical experiments ...
###4520 ... done with the administration of noxious substances ...
###4529 ... electric or traumatic shocks ...
###4543 ... unanesthetized operations ...
###4556 ... burns ...
###4588 ... drawn-out deprivations of food and drink ...
###4595 ... physical and psychological tortures ...
###4598 ... that lead to mental imbalance ...
###4600 ... infections ... and so on.
###4604 (UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA) Head injury research involves partially
###4608 or fully conscious baboons strapped down with restraints ...
###4612 ... and their heads cemented into a metal helmet,
###4614 which will be thrust at a 60 degree angle at a force of up to 1,000 Gs.
###4648 The purpose of this experiment is to simulate auto crashes ...
###4653 ... football ... boxing ... and other head related injuries.
###4658 And this process is often repeated again and again on the same animals.
###4665 MILITARY RESEARCH
###4666 And finally, military research.
###4670 This one speaks for itself.
###4674 >From sending monkeys into outer space,
###4678 and testing atomic blasts on helpless dogs,
###4682 to exposing primates to nuclear radiation.
###4688 Twenty years ago, the number of animals
###4691 dying of tortures through the practice of vivisection was astronomical,
###4695 estimated at 400,000 per day world wide,
###4699 and growing at an annual rate of five percent.
###4704 Today that number is almost
###4706 beyond comprehension. 19,000 per minute. 10 billion per year.
###4719 Some uneducated persons pretend to
###4721 know that less intelligent animals don't feel pain the same way we do.
###4728 In truth, we know very little about how specific animals may "feel",
###4734 except that they must also submit to the universal law that causes every
###4739 organism dying by unnatural means to suffer greatly before that final release.
###4749 But it's nonsense to say that the animals
###4751 do not suffer because they have a lower order of intelligence.
###4759 FORCE-FEEDING GEESE "FOIE GRAS"
###4761 Pain is pain, conveyed by nerves to the brain,
###4766 and there are other nerves than those of intelligence...
###4770 ...nerves such as sight, smell, touch, and hearing.
###4776 And in some animals these nerves are much more highly developed than in man.
###4786 We know that there has never been an epoch
###4789 in which we could learn something about the physiology of man by torturing animals;
###4795 we only learned something about animals.
###4799 And if there is something we can learn from them on the psychological level,
###4803 it is not by means of steel or electricity, much less so through psychic violences.
###4809 The systematic torture of sentient beings,
###4814 whatever the pretext and in whatever form, cannot achieve anything more than it already has:
###4819 to show us what is the lowest point of debasement man can reach.
###4832 If that's what we want to know.
###4836 "As long as there are slaughterhouses, there will be battlefields".
###4844 - Leo Tolstoy
###4862 Ignorance is the speciesist's first line of defense.
###4867 Yet it is easily breached by anyone with the time and determination to find out the truth.
###4874 Ignorance has prevailed so long only because people do not want to find out the truth.
###4882 "Don't tell me, you'll spoil my dinner"
###4885 is the usual reply to any attempt to tell someone just how that dinner was produced.
###4891 Even people who are aware that
###4893 the traditional family farm has been taken over by big business interests...
###4899 ...that their clothes come from slaughtered cows, that their entertainment means the
###4904 suffering and death of millions of animals... and that some questionable
###4908 experiments go on in laboratories,
###4911 still cling to a vague belief that conditions cannot be too bad,
###4916 (PREGNAT MARE URINE AKA: "PREMARIN")
###4921 or else the government or the animal welfare societies would have done something about it.
###4924 But it is not the inability to find out what is going on as much as a desire not to know about
###4931 facts that may lie heavy on one's conscience that is responsible for this lack of awareness -
###4938 - after all, the victims of whatever it is that goes on in all these awful places
###4944 are not members of one's own group.
###4954 It all comes down to pain and suffering.
###4958 Not intelligence, not strength, not social class or civil right.
###4964 Pain and suffering are in themselves bad and should be prevented or minimized,
###4968 irrespective of the race, sex, or species of the being that suffers.
###4977 We are all creatures.
###4982 And non-human animals experience sensations just like we do.
###4986 They too are strong, intelligent, industrious, mobile, and evolutional.
###4993 They too are capable of growth and adaptation.
###4996 Like us, first and foremost, they are earthlings.
###5001 And like us, they are surviving.
###5006 Like us, they also seek their own comfort rather than discomfort.
###5010 And like us, they express degrees of emotion.
###5016 In short, like us, they are alive;
###5021 most of them being, in fact, vertebrae, just like us.
###5045 As we look back on how essential animals are to human survival;
###5050 our absolute dependence on them
###5054 (for companionship ... food ...
###5055 ... clothing ...
###5057 ... sport and entertainment ...
###5060 ... as well as medical and scientific research),
###5064 ironically ... we only see mankind's complete disrespect for these non-human providers.
###5072 Without a doubt, this must be what it is...
###5076 ... to "bite the hand that feeds us".
###5081 In fact, we have actually stomped and spit on it.
###5089 Now we are faced with the inevitable aftermath.
###5092 This is evident in health reports due to our over-excessive consumption of animals.
###5098 Cancer,
###5099 heart disease,
###5100 Osteoporosis,
###5102 strokes,
###5103 kidney stones,
###5105 Anemia,
###5106 diabetes, and more.
###5113 Even our food has now been effected ... and at its very source.
###5118 With antibiotics used to promote weight gain in animals
###5122 (who can't gain weight under the stressful, overcrowded living conditions in factory farms);
###5127 with the over-use of pesticides and insecticides;
###5132 or artificial hormones
###5134 (designed to increase milk production, litter size and frequency);
###5139 with artificial colors, herbicides, larvicides,
###5145 synthetic fertilizers, tranquilizers, growth and appetite stimulants ...
###5153 ... it's no wonder that Mad Cow Disease ... Foot and Mouth Disease ... Pfiesteria ...
###5157 and a host of other animal related abnormalities have been
###5160 (POLLUTION) unleashed on the human public.
###5164 Nature is not responsible for these actions.
###5168 (DEFORESTATION) We are.
###5176 So a change is inevitable. Either we make it ourselves,
###5181 or we will be forced to make it by Nature Itself.
###5186 The time has come for each of us to reconsider our eating habits,
###5190 our traditions,
###5192 our lifestyles and fashions,
###5194 and above all, our way of thinking.
###5205 So, if there is any truth to the age-old saying,
###5208 "What goes around, comes around", then what do they get for their pain?
###5214 Do we even give it a second thought?
###5219 If what goes around comes around, what do they get for their pain?
###5228 They are earthlings.
###5231 They have the right to be here just as much as humans do.
###5237 Perhaps the answer is found in another age-old saying ...
###5242 ... and one equally true:
###5247 We reap just what we sow.
###5256 So of course, animals feel, and of course they experience pain.
###5264 After all, has nature endowed these wonderful animals with well-springs of sentiment
###5269 so that they should not feel ...
###5273 ... or do animals have nerves in order to be insensitive?
###5281 Reason demands a better answer.
###5287 But one thing is absolutely certain: animals used for food, used for clothing,
###5294 used for entertainment, and in scientific experiments
###5298 and all the oppression that is done to them under the sun
###5302 they all die from pain.
###5306 Each and every one.
###5311 Isn't it enough that animals
###5313 the world over live in permanent retreat from human progress and expansion?
###5319 And for many species ... there is simply nowhere else to go.
###5326 It seems the fate of many animals is either to be unwanted by man ...
###5331 ... or wanted too much.
###5335 We enter as lords of the earth bearing strange powers of terror and mercy alike ...
###5341 But Human beings should love animals as ...
###5345 the knowing love the innocent, and the strong love the vulnerable.
###5350 When we wince at the suffering of animals,
###5354 that feeling speaks well of us even when we ignore it,
###5358 and those who dismiss love for our fellow creatures as mere sentimentality
###5364 overlook a good and important part of our humanity.
###5369 But it takes nothing away from a human to be kind to an animal.
###5375 And it is actually within us
###5378 to grant them a happy life ... and a long one.
###5385 On the heath, King Lear asked Gloucester: "How do you see the world?"
###5392 And Gloucester, who is blind, answered:
###5396 "I see it feelingly".
###5401 I see it feelingly.
###5406 Three primary life forces exist on this planet:
###5411 Nature,
###5413 Animals
###5417 and Humankind.
###5423 We are the Earthlings.
###5429 Make the connection.
