1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,3



2
0:0:3,3 --> 0:0:4,57
MALE SPEAKER 1: A club
is like a play.


3
0:0:4,57 --> 0:0:7,5
The decorist, he
sets the tone.


4
0:0:7,5 --> 0:0:8,995
You have to have a good
director, you have to have


5
0:0:8,995 --> 0:0:9,57
good music.


6
0:0:9,57 --> 0:0:11,43
Every element counts.


7
0:0:11,43 --> 0:0:16,9
MALE SPEAKER 2: The best night
is you go out, and you end up


8
0:0:16,9 --> 0:0:18,9
maybe on a plane to Paris
with a beautiful girl.


9
0:0:18,9 --> 0:0:21,22
You want to set the
stage for that.


10
0:0:21,22 --> 0:0:25,35



11
0:0:25,35 --> 0:0:27,98
MALE SPEAKER 3: We invited five
designers in New York.


12
0:0:27,98 --> 0:0:30,31
And they come from different
design disciplines.


13
0:0:30,31 --> 0:0:33,54
Getting the opportunity to
design a kind of vision of the


14
0:0:33,54 --> 0:0:36,86
future club, it's like a
dream for any designer.


15
0:0:36,86 --> 0:0:39,6
We didn't know at all what
this is going to bring.


16
0:0:39,6 --> 0:0:40,34
It's a risk.


17
0:0:40,34 --> 0:0:43,7
On the other hand, we're
there to experiment.


18
0:0:43,7 --> 0:0:45,42
MALE SPEAKER 4: Night club of
the future may not look


19
0:0:45,42 --> 0:0:46,93
totally futuristic.


20
0:0:46,93 --> 0:0:49,35
MALE SPEAKER 5: You have to try
to design something that's


21
0:0:49,35 --> 0:0:51,62
timeless to the best
of your ability.


22
0:0:51,62 --> 0:0:53,49
MALE SPEAKER 6: It's all about
just creating one night


23
0:0:53,49 --> 0:0:55,52
that'll create a lasting
impression for the rest of


24
0:0:55,52 --> 0:0:58,51
their lives, creating a memory
that people will never forget.


25
0:0:58,51 --> 0:2:58,51
