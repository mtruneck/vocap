###86 For luck.
###87 Thank you, sir. Being a sailor, you'll need luck.
###90 A young sailor too.
###93 I don't need eyes to tell me that.
###95 Young seamen all want luck when they're outward bound.
###99 Only the old ones know that there's nothing...
###101 ...but bad luck and bad blows at sea.
###105 An officer too.
###107 How'd you know?
###108 I heard your suitcase go down.
###111 A seaman would be having a soft bag.
###116 Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
###118 If it's the <i>Altair</i> you're boarding, sir...
###121 ...she's a bad ship.
###122 You've got a blind man's tricks for telling what men are like, but ships...
###126 ...you can't tell about ships.
###144 I'm the third officer. Where can I find the captain?
###164 <i>This is another man</i> <i>I can never know...</i>
###167 <i>... because I cannot talk with him.</i>
###170 <i>For I am a mute and cannot speak.</i>
###173 <i>I am cut off from other men...</i>
###176 <i>... but in my own silence...</i>
###178 <i>... I can hear things they cannot hear...</i>
###181 <i>... know things they can never know.</i>
###190 Okay, fellas, pull that cover over here.
###237 - Mr. Merriam? - Yes, sir.
###239 I'm Captain Stone.
###240 How do you do, sir?
###243 I chose you, Merriam, and I don't regret my choice.
###245 - Thank you, sir. - I looked up the records...
###247 ...of the training ship graduates. You seemed the most likely man for me.
###251 - You know why? - No, sir.
###253 Your history could have been my own at your age.
###256 An orphan.
###258 Serious.
###259 Hardworking. Anxious to get somewhere.
###264 - We'll get on, you and I. - Thank you.
###266 I like a good ship, a clean ship, an obedient ship.
###270 As third officer, you'll have certain authority.
###272 Use it well, and <i>Altair</i> will be that kind of ship.
###275 - I'll do everything I can. - Fine.
###277 Go to your quarters and get ready for work.
###279 All right, sir.
###284 Don't.
###285 You've no right to kill that moth.
###287 Its safety doesn't depend on you.
###289 I'm sorry. I don't understand.
###292 Never mind. I'll explain sometime.
###295 We've a long voyage ahead of us.
###297 You know, that's one of the nice things about long voyages, time for talk...
###300 ...time for friendship.
###302 - You'll find your cabin on the main deck. - All right, sir.
###316 - Oh, steward? - Yes, sir.
###318 My name is Merriam. I'm the new third.
###320 Your quarters are right over here, Mr. Merriam.
###323 Thank you.
###336 The berth isn't made up.
###338 Sorry, sir. I haven't had a chance since Mr. Lingard died.
###341 He was the last third officer.
###343 - He died in this berth? - That's right, sir.
###346 He had such convulsions, he would have died on the floor...
###348 ...if he hadn't have been held in the berth.
###355 Somehow, it seemed more proper for him to die there than on the floor, sir.
###359 - What was the matter with him? - I don't know, sir.
###362 He didn't want to die.
###363 He was always telling funny stories.
###365 Well, make it up. Can you change the blankets and the sheets?
###369 - Yes, sir. - Open the porthole there.
###371 Soon as we're under way, we'll get air here.
###373 We'll be shoving off in an hour, sir.
###377 On deck, you guys. The captain wants a look at you.
###380 <i>Rise and shine for the Dunham Line</i> <i>I don't mean one, I don't mean two</i>
###383 <i>I mean the whole sweet bellboy crew</i>
###386 The skipper wants to look you over. Get in there, tall one.
###392 Hey, you, Scotty, can the music.
###395 On deck. Come on, Scotty.
###397 I ain't Scotch, Boats. I'm Greek.
###399 It's only Greeks can play these things good.
###401 In home country, we play it to the sheep.
###404 You'll get all the sheep you want. We're going south for a full cargo.
###407 Sheep hides, mutton, tallow.
###409 Why, we even bring back the smell of the sheep.
###415 We have a new crew, Mr. Merriam.
###416 You and Mr. Bowns better look them over.
###419 Come on, Merriam.
###424 Go ahead, Boats.
###425 - Ausman, Jack. - Here.
###427 - Benson, William. - Here.
###428 - Carter, Claude. - Present.
###430 Claude.
###434 Pipe down, you guys.
###436 - Corbin, John. - Here.
###437 I've shipped with this man before. He's a good seaman, sir.
###441 - Thank you, mister. - Okay.
###443 - Farnham, Ed. - Here.
###444 - Mikross, Peter. - Here.
###445 Lindstrom, Paulo.
###450 Paulo Lindstrom.
###452 The guy's a dummy.
###453 Finn.
###454 Keep your eye on that man, Boats. I don't want any trouble on this ship.
###458 - McCall, Tom. - Yeah.
###460 - O'Connor, Jack. - Present.
###461 - Parker, Louis. - Here, teacher.
###467 Radd, William.
###468 <i>I'm Billy Radd from La Trinidad</i>
###471 Pipe down, you guys.
###473 Jensen, George. George Jensen.
###475 Jensen.
###478 - Vaughn, Jim. - Here.
###480 - Waite, Leonard. - Here.
###481 Everybody here, sir, except Jensen.
###483 Maybe in the fo'c's'le.
###485 George was right behind me when we came out of the fo'c's'le, sir.
###488 Jensen.
###491 George Jensen.
###497 Jensen.
###500 There he is.
###514 Captain, I don't get any pulse.
###516 I'm afraid the man's dead.
###518 Most likely heart failure, Mr. Bowns.
###520 He was an old man.
###526 <i>The man is dead.</i>
###528 <i>With his death, the waters of the sea</i> <i>are open to us...</i>
###532 <i>... but there will be other deaths.</i>
###535 <i>And the agony of dying...</i>
###538 <i>... before we come to land again.</i>
###562 Log at zero, sir.
###567 The log is set at zero, sir, 8:23.
###570 Fine.
###572 Seems good to get going.
###574 I heard one of the men putting it another way.
###576 I heard him say, "The ship comes to life at sea."
###579 I suppose that's the way all sailors feel.
###581 It's good for a sailor to go to sea.
###583 It's even better for an officer.
###586 It's a good feeling.
###589 In San Pedro, I was just another captain.
###592 At sea, I am the captain.
###598 It's got to be coiled with the sun. It's a law of the sea.
###602 That ain't a law. If you break a law, you get arrested.
###605 If you milk a cow the wrong way, she kicks.
###607 If you coil a rope the wrong way, it can't kick.
###610 I believe in logic.
###614 Aboard ship, you'd better believe in the captain and forget logic.
###617 You coil a line the wrong way once, and you'll find out.
###620 The captain's got more law at sea than any man on land has got...
###624 ...even the king of Siam...
###627 ...or the president of the United States.
###630 Why, a captain can marry you.
###632 Not me. I had a wife.
###636 No, sir. I don't feel any different.
###639 When I was on the training ship, I was a cadet. Now I'm an officer.
###643 - Somehow, I don't feel different. - You should.
###646 It's all the difference between being a man and being a boy.
###650 It's more than that.
###651 It's the difference between being a man and being an officer.
###654 I know, but somehow, I can't believe yet that I'm an officer.
###657 I passed my examinations, I'm qualified...
###660 ...but still I haven't that feeling that you speak about.
###663 - That feeling of authority. - You'll learn it.
###666 You'll even learn to take great joy in it.
###676 - You seasick? - I have never been seasick.
###680 Papa rocked me in his arms when I was baptized.
###683 That's the way you keep a good Greek kid from getting sick at sea.
###687 - What's the matter with your belly, then? - It hurts.
###692 She's a beautiful ship, captain.
###695 A beautiful ship for a first berth.
###697 She's a beautiful ship to command.
###709 Hiya, Tertius.
###711 I'm Sparks.
###713 - What did you call me? - Tertius.
###715 What's that mean?
###716 You share Bill Shakespeare's lack of knowledge. No Latin and less Greek.
###721 Tertius, my ignorant friend, means "third," and you're the third officer.
###726 I suppose it would be a big help to give deck orders in Latin.
###729 It's not much use on the radio either.
###731 - Come on in. - All right.
###734 It's a relief to find someone onboard I can talk to.
###737 All I've been doing is saying, "yes, sir," all morning.
###740 - The captain? - No, thanks.
###742 Me, I take the captain <i>cum grano salis.</i>
###746 Remember, I'm like Shakespeare.
###747 With a grain of salt.
###749 I like the old man. He seems a good skipper.
###752 - I've sailed with him before. - No, I mean it.
###756 I like the way he talks. The things he has to say.
###759 I don't know. I just stick to my job here. I don't mix with the officers.
###763 But I'll be glad to teach you Latin or take money away from you at cards.
###767 All right. I'll look in on you after my watch.
###789 Okay, I gotcha.
###791 One forty-two.
###801 One forty-two, sir.
###803 Everything gone well on your watch, Mr. Merriam?
###805 Everything's fine, sir.
###807 But I think I'll have that hook secured before I go below.
###809 - We might run into a sea. - That's fresh paint, Mr. Merriam.
###813 A line will mar it.
###815 - I like a neat ship. - Yes, sir.
###825 Want that hook made fast, mister? Might be hard to do if it gets sloppy.
###829 No, Boats. Not yet. Paint's too wet.
###851 Lights are bright, sir.
###854 Better turn in, Tom. Get some sleep before your watch.
###857 Okay.
###862 Haven't you deck officers any regard for life and limb?
###865 - Why, that's all right. - All right?
###867 Why, you fellows could kill a guy with that. You better secure it.
###870 It's freshly painted. We don't want to mar the paint.
###873 You'll mar somebody's skull if you don't do something.
###876 I'll speak to the captain.
###881 - Excuse me, sir... - lf you want to discuss...
###883 ...the hook with me, I've already given my considered opinion...
###886 ...as to the danger involved.
###908 On the bridge. The hook.
###926 Look out! Heads!
###941 - Look out. - John. John.
###944 You men there, get in and get that hook.
###946 Make fast this end. I'll fasten it around the hook.
###950 Lower away on that winch.
###952 - I can't. The cable's fouled. - Get out there and grab that hook.
###979 Put a stopper on that hook, Mr. Merriam.
###995 Well, back to the black hole of Calcutta.
###1006 What are you thinking about, Mr. Merriam?
###1009 I think I can tell you. You're thinking about the hook.
###1013 You've made up your mind that I was negligent.
###1015 - That's about it, isn't it? - Yes, sir, I was thinking that.
###1018 You have no right to think that, you know.
###1021 - The responsibility is yours. - Mine?
###1024 I don't see that, sir. I warned you about the hook.
###1027 - I told you twice about it. - Exactly.
###1030 That's what I referred to.
###1032 You almost forced me into a position where I had to show my authority...
###1035 ...even though it put me in the wrong. - I didn't see it that way.
###1039 But granted I was wrong, sir, I don't see how you risked...
###1042 ...the lives of John and the other men. - I have rights over their lives, Mr. Merriam.
###1047 Remember the first day you came into my office?
###1049 - Only vaguely. - I told you...
###1051 ...you had no right to kill that moth...
###1053 ...because its safety did not depend on you.
###1056 I have the right to do what I want with the crew...
###1058 ...because their safety depends on me.
###1060 I stand ready any hour of the day or night to give my life for their safety...
###1064 ...and for the safety of this vessel.
###1067 And because I do, I have certain rights of risk over them.
###1071 - Now do you understand? - Yes, sir, I think I understand.
###1075 You must understand.
###1076 It's the first thing you have to learn about authority.
###1082 This liniment should have penetrated by now, Peter.
###1085 It's always worked like magic on cows and horses.
###1089 And it's the only thing that ever cured my old man's lumbago.
###1095 It's the liniment plus a kind of hypnotism or something I got in my hands.
###1103 There. How is that? You feel okay now, don't you?
###1107 It's the other side where the pain is, Jim.
###1111 You mean to tell me you've just been laying there letting me rub on this side...
###1115 ...when it's there?
###1120 Mr. Merriam. I was working on him...
###1123 ...but I just touched him there, and he passed right out.
###1128 Has he ever complained of pain here before?
###1132 <i>Panama calling</i> Altair. <i>Is the patient under anesthetic?</i>
###1135 <i>Altair</i> to Panama. Patient is asleep, breathing very heavily.
###1141 <i>If the patient is completely anesthetized,</i> <i>you may proceed.</i>
###1145 <i>Are you ready?</i>
###1150 <i>Altair</i> to Panama. We are ready.
###1153 <i>Panama to</i> Altair.
###1155 <i>Captain Stone will bring his right hand</i> <i>to the point which we have already...</i>
###1158 <i>... established as the region</i> <i>of the appendix.</i>
###1161 <i>Place the point of the scalpel</i> <i>exactly on this spot.</i>
###1171 <i>Make the incision.</i>
###1173 <i>Incise to a depth of one-quarter inch.</i>
###1181 <i>Continue with the incision vertically,</i> <i>4 inches.</i>
###1198 <i>Have you made the incision?</i>
###1200 <i>Panama to</i> Altair<i>,</i> <i>have you made the incision?</i>
###1208 <i>Altair</i> to Panama, wait a minute. We're not ready yet.
###1227 <i>Altair</i> to Panama, we are ready. Please repeat.
###1231 <i>Make an incision a quarter</i> <i>of an inch deep.</i>
###1234 <i>Four inches on the vertical line</i> <i>already described.</i>
###1248 <i>Altair</i> to Panama<i>,</i> the incision has been made.
###1263 You're not doing so good with that, Louie.
###1265 The Greek says you got to be a Greek to play on it.
###1268 How do I know I ain't?
###1269 How do you know you ain't gonna catch appendicitis from it?
###1274 I heard it's catching.
###1277 Wonder how they're getting on.
###1279 Me, I've got magnetic hands. Healing hands.
###1283 Still I wouldn't want to be in the captain's shoes.
###1286 It ain't easy.
###1287 Hello, Panama. Hello. Government hospital, Panama.
###1290 Dr. Ostglow. Steamship <i>Altair</i>. Radio operator speaking.
###1294 Altair<i>, come in.</i>
###1296 Hello, doctor...
###1297 ...the patient is breathing normally, heartbeat is good.
###1300 Thank you, Dr. Ostglow.
###1302 We will continue to follow with instructions.
###1304 Compliments of Captain Stone, thank you again. <i>Altair</i> signing off.
###1310 Tertius, well done. You're a gent.
###1314 And you'll be a scholar if you hang around me.
###1317 - Give me a cigarette, will you? - Sure.
###1322 Thanks.
###1327 He'll live, God willing. And no thanks to the captain.
###1330 Sparks...
###1333 ...let's not say anything about this. - What do you mean?
###1336 I mean, let's not tell anyone the captain didn't do the operation.
###1339 - You're crazy. - But you know how it is.
###1341 Some guys don't like the sight of blood and things like that.
###1344 Okay, if you want it that way.
###1346 But me...
###1347 ...l'd like to hear the next conversation you have with the captain.
###1351 One of those talks he gives on authority.
###1357 Mark.
###1367 - Can I see you for a moment? - Yes, sir.
###1377 Mr. Merriam, I want to thank you for yesterday.
###1379 That's all right, sir.
###1381 - I'd like to thank you and explain. - You don't have to explain, sir.
###1384 There are a lot of people squeamish about blood.
###1387 I'm not squeamish, Mr. Merriam. I'm not afraid of anything but failure.
###1390 That's why I didn't go through with the operation.
###1393 I'm a sea captain. I know my profession.
###1395 But I'm not a doctor, and I might have failed.
###1399 - You see that, don't you, Tom? - Of course I do, sir.
###1402 I knew you'd see it.
###1403 Just as I knew the first time I saw you that you were the man for me.
###1407 A man who'd think as I think.
###1409 I've not been disappointed.
###1415 Oh, hiya, Tertius.
###1416 You haven't said anything, Sparks...
###1418 ...about my having performed the operation, have you?
###1421 I just thought I'd remind you.
###1423 - Been talking with the captain again? - Yeah.
###1426 - He's been talking about authority? - That's right.
###1430 He made a lot of sense. There's something in what he says.
###1433 Wasn't much sense in what he did yesterday.
###1435 - He explained all that. - Yeah, I'll bet.
###1437 He's a smooth man with the words, the captain.
###1440 Now, wait a minute, Sparks. You've got him all wrong.
###1442 He's the first older man who's treated me like a friend...
###1446 ...and that means something. - Yeah, I know.
###1449 I can see your way of thinking.
###1450 You had a tough time when you were a kid. Not much friendliness.
###1454 But, Tom...
###1455 ...there's a friendliness that tries to get you to thinking wrong.
###1461 But that's got nothing to do with me.
###1462 We're bound south. It's a long voyage, and I have to tend radio.
###1502 If you guys want any more, you can get it yourself.
###1505 Okay, Stew.
###1509 Boats, the captain's complaining about the way the deck's being kept.
###1513 It ain't as spick-and-span as I'd like it.
###1515 We're shorthanded with Jensen dead and the Greek in his berth.
###1518 The boy's taking turns standing double watches.
###1520 Yeah. Can't help that. The captain wants a clean ship.
###1524 Aye, aye, sir.
###1540 You're crazy.
###1541 Whoever heard of a captain putting into port just because one man's dead...
###1545 ...and one man's off-duty? I've been to sea since I've been a boy.
###1548 I've never heard of anything like that.
###1550 That's because most sailors don't know the law.
###1553 With the Greek sick, captain should port to fill up the crew.
###1556 Why, you told me yourself that the captain is the law at sea.
###1560 That's the way it used to be.
###1562 Now they got new laws, and they say the captain's got to put into port...
###1565 ...to fill up his crew on a coastwise trip.
###1568 Never heard of it.
###1569 Why don't you tell all that to the captain yourself?
###1572 - Who wants to bet I don't dare? - I'll bet 1000 bucks.
###1575 You four-flushers wouldn't bet 10 real cents.
###1579 Put up or shut up.
###1587 So I felt it only proper to bring this just complaint of the men...
###1590 ...to you in person, captain.
###1593 You know, there are captains who might hold this against you, Louie.
###1613 Hey, in there, nearly finished?
###1616 I'll be there in a minute.
###1627 Okay, let her go.
###1633 All right. Let her go.
###1662 Hey, hold the chain. The door's locked!
###1665 Hold the chain!
###1673 Stop it! Stop!
###1682 Stop.
###1698 Start washing down. I'll take a look at the locker.
###1715 What's wrong?
###1721 You'd better get a couple of men down here and get that cleaned up.
###1725 - It's Louie. - He was a troublemaker.
###1728 But he was a nice guy. Always kidding.
###1731 You're impressed.
###1733 Death is so absolute.
###1735 You looked into the chain locker, no more Louie.
###1738 No more insolent remarks.
###1740 No more danger to the discipline of the ship.
###1743 - You didn't like him. - Of course I didn't like him.
###1746 He was a sea lawyer, full of windy complaints...
###1748 ...seasoned with bad comedy.
###1750 So you shut the hatch.
###1752 Shut the hatch?
###1754 - What do you mean, Mr. Merriam? - The hatch was shut.
###1759 And I think it was locked.
###1761 You accuse me of doing this out of spite...
###1763 ...because the man was insubordinate?
###1765 This is what you meant when you said you had rights over the lives of the crew.
###1769 - You murdered him. - You're a little hasty, Mr. Merriam.
###1773 You can't expect me just to stand by and watch you kill a man.
###1776 What do you propose to do? Denounce me?
###1786 May I speak to you, Mr. Bowns, on a matter of great importance?
###1789 What is it?
###1791 What is the law about an incompetent captain, Mr. Bowns?
###1794 Why interrupt me with a question like that when you see I'm working?
###1798 You know the answer. The first officer would take over.
###1801 I think the captain is incompetent.
###1804 Louie getting killed in the chain locker, that wasn't an accident.
###1808 The captain did it purposely.
###1810 I don't know what you're trying to pull, fella.
###1812 But my advice is, pull in your ears before you get yourself into a jam you don't like.
###1818 Now get away from me. I'm busy.
###1820 - But, Mr. Bowns, I'm not joking. - You heard me.
###1823 And I'm the first officer.
###1839 - Hey, what's wrong, kid? - The captain's crazy, Sparks.
###1843 Sure the captain's crazy.
###1845 Anyone who'd ride one hobbyhorse so hard is bound to be bugs.
###1849 And what a hobby to pick, authority.
###1852 Well, I'm glad you believe me. Bowns practically threw me off the ship.
###1856 Sure. The captain's a little tetched.
###1859 This isn't a gag. I mean it. He's really crazy. Insane.
###1864 Hey, now, you know, well, most people are.
###1867 But he killed Louie. That wasn't an accident in the chain locker. That was murder.
###1871 You know, kid. You might be a little excited yourself.
###1874 - Well, let me tell you from the beginning... - Not me. Don't tell me.
###1877 I like my job, and I want to keep it.
###1879 When we get to port, I'll tell the company agent.
###1882 You'll lose your job.
###1883 Even if I believed you, I'd advise you not to.
###1885 You can't mean that, Sparks.
###1887 I believe in keeping my nose clean. Really clean.
###1890 And out of other people's business.
###1892 - That's the only way to get along. - Not me.
###1895 When something's wrong, I've got to do something about it.
###1897 I'm going to report this when we get ashore.
###1929 All right.
###1933 Report to the captain. San Sebastián light, 2 points off the port bow.
###1936 Yes, sir.
###1957 All fast, sir.
###1964 - Hello, Will. It's good to see you. - Always good to see you, Charlie.
###1967 - This is my first officer, Mr. Bowns. - Mr. Bowns.
###1970 - Mr. Roberts. - My third, Mr. Merriam.
###1972 - How do you do, sir? - Mr. Roberts is our agent here.
###1975 This your first voyage to this port, Mr. Merriam?
###1977 - Yes. In fact, it's my first long voyage. - Drop into the office, I'll get you a guide.
###1982 - Thank you. - Be sure and take him up on that.
###1984 The Dunham Line may be strict aboard ship...
###1987 ...but you'll find it friendly on shore. - Drop by the office.
###1990 Thank you.
###2030 I'm glad you accepted my invitation so promptly, Mr. Merriam.
###2034 Thank you.
###2035 Actually, I'd like to have a few words with you, Mr. Roberts...
###2039 ...on a matter of great importance. - Of course. Sit down.
###2042 - Thank you. - Make yourself comfortable.
###2044 - All right, Jose, you can go now. - Yes, sir.
###2050 Well, Mr. Merriam, what is the matter of importance?
###2053 It's about Captain Stone, sir.
###2055 An old friend. A great friend of mine, Mr. Merriam.
###2058 That makes it all the more difficult.
###2060 What I have to tell you is extremely unpleasant.
###2062 And not the captain.
###2064 Mr. Merriam himself gave the order not to stopper the hook.
###2067 To my mind, Mr. Merriam had been working kind of hard or something.
###2070 This is my first voyage with Captain Stone as it is the for all the crew...
###2074 ...except Mr. Bowns, the radio operator and the steward. And all the men are agreed...
###2078 ...the captain... - That will do, Boats.
###2080 - Aye, aye, sir. - Thank you.
###2083 Billy Radd.
###2089 I'd like to hear what you have to say about the captain.
###2092 I'd like to know if you think him competent...
###2094 ...or if he had anything to do with the death of Louie Carter.
###2098 No, sir. It's like the others said, we just can't understand it.
###2101 The captain is a good captain.
###2103 What you call a kind man and a gentleman.
###2106 And Mr. Merriam, he was always a fine gentleman.
###2108 - We all liked Mr. Merriam too. - That'll do for now, Billy. Thank you.
###2113 If I could have your permission, I would like to mention just one thing, Mr. Roberts, sir.
###2118 The captain here hasn't only given us the best food...
###2121 ...and looked after the ship his own self at all times...
###2124 ...but he saved my life by that operation at sea.
###2127 And I never in my life can forget that.
###2133 Should I call in any more witnesses, Mr. Merriam?
###2138 You men may be a little puzzled by what's been going on here.
###2141 Mr. Merriam made certain statements.
###2143 I called this informal hearing to prove to him how unfounded they were.
###2147 I felt it my duty as the company agent...
###2149 ...to prevent public investigation of a baseless charge.
###2153 Thank you all for cooperating so splendidly.
###2158 Have a good time.
###2174 I'm sorry this had to happen, Tom.
###2184 Ellen will be wanting to see you.
###2186 I'm sure she's been waiting for you since she saw the <i>Altair...</i>
###2189 ...come into the harbor last night.
###2191 Ellen?
###2193 - Does she watch for my ship? - She's always watching for your ship.
###2200 She's got good news.
###2217 Is Captain Stone aboard?
###2219 No, ma'am. He'll be back in an hour or so. He's with Mr. Roberts.
###2222 You're the new third officer, aren't you?
###2225 I was, but how did you know?
###2227 Captain Stone wrote me about you. A long letter even before he met you.
###2231 He was most enthusiastic about your training ship record.
###2234 I know.
###2235 I'm Ellen Roberts, an old friend of the captain.
###2238 Because of his letters, I feel as if I knew you too.
###2241 - Tom Merriam. - How do you do?
###2243 Where in the world are you going with that bag?
###2246 Doesn't the <i>Altair</i> sail tomorrow night?
###2248 She sails without me, Ms. Roberts.
###2250 That sounds serious.
###2253 While I'm waiting, won't you let me give you a lift?
###2255 - Then you can tell me all about it. - No, thank you.
###2258 That bag will be awfully heavy by the time you reach the hotel.
###2262 - Come along. - All right.
###2294 And so you're dreadfully disappointed and dreadfully hurt.
###2297 The whole world seems to have turned against you...
###2300 ...just because you made a mistake. - I didn't make a mistake.
###2304 That's almost the captain's voice, Tom.
###2306 "I didn't make a mistake." "I couldn't make a mistake."
###2309 "I'm authority." "I'm the captain."
###2312 "I'm the third officer."
###2315 I've heard it all so often.
###2317 It's all so wrong.
###2319 You're just like the captain, Tom.
###2322 Lonely, austere, bitter.
###2324 Without family or friends.
###2326 Condemning yourself to a bloodless, ghost-like existence.
###2331 And in the end, it will be only a ghost ship you will command.
###2335 How long do you think I've known the captain, Tom?
###2337 I don't know.
###2339 I've known him for 15 years.
###2342 For 15 years, I've tried to give him love instead of loneliness.
###2346 You mustn't be like him.
###2348 You've got to embrace warmth and life.
###2351 - A good joke, a pretty girl. - I don't know any girls.
###2355 That's clear enough, but you will.
###2358 I have a younger sister in San Pedro.
###2360 She's a secretary for the Dunham Line.
###2362 She'll meet you on your next trip north. I'll see to that.
###2366 If you don't like her, she'll introduce you to other girls...
###2369 ...and other young men. Young men who don't even know...
###2372 ...what the word "authority" means.
###2375 I'll see that you don't become another Captain Stone.
###2378 I'm going to change him too.
###2380 I can now.
###2383 I have the right.
###2394 But this is not like you, Will. I've never known you to hold grudges.
###2397 I don't want him on my ship.
###2401 People seem to be turning against me.
###2405 The boy...
###2407 ...some of the crew.
###2409 I feel their dislike.
###2412 - Their distrust. - Oh, nonsense.
###2415 You're only imagining things.
###2416 You work too hard, too long, Will.
###2419 This voyage down without a second officer, standing watches.
###2422 It's been hard on you.
###2423 When you get back to the States, have a good checkup. Take a rest.
###2428 It isn't my health that I'm worried about.
###2432 I've lived a lonely life.
###2434 A hard life.
###2436 You and Ellen are the only friends I've ever had.
###2438 All you need's a rest. See a good doctor, just as I've said.
###2447 You'll see Ellen tonight.
###2449 Find new interests.
###2452 There are no new interests.
###2456 Just authority.
###2458 Authority.
###2471 - I have something to tell you, Will. - That's what Charlie said.
###2475 I wanted to be here, aboard the <i>Altair</i>, when I told you.
###2479 I want my rival to hear and feel my triumph.
###2483 I've always loved your fancies, Ellen.
###2486 This isn't a fancy.
###2488 I want the old <i>Altair</i> to know that I'm a free woman.
###2492 That I can take you from her and keep you from her.
###2497 - You won your case. - Yes. He finally gave in.
###2501 The final papers came through last week.
###2503 I'm a free woman.
###2511 I expected a different response, Will.
###2517 I thought we were both waiting for this.
###2520 I had waited.
###2522 I had wanted this.
###2525 But now there's little I can do or say.
###2529 I'm afraid.
###2530 - Afraid of me, Will? - Of my mind, Ellen.
###2534 I don't trust it anymore.
###2535 - Your mind? - Don't come close to me. Stand there.
###2538 But, Will, I...
###2540 I remember Captain Blaker of the <i>Ajax.</i>
###2543 She's my first ship.
###2546 I was a mess boy.
###2549 I watched him lose his mind, little by little.
###2552 He knew it and could do nothing about it.
###2557 It was awful, Ellen. I've never forgotten it.
###2560 We were run down in a fog off the coast of the Mersey.
###2563 The <i>Ajax</i> sank like a rock.
###2566 Blaker went with her.
###2568 He was lucky.
###2569 It's only your memory that frightens you.
###2572 It's more than that.
###2573 I felt strange.
###2577 Why, I've done things that I couldn't remember doing.
###2582 I've had moments that I felt that I was on the verge...
###2586 ...of losing control.
###2588 Doing some terrible, stupid, ugly thing.
###2593 This morning, when the boy testified against me...
###2595 ...I could barely keep my seat.
###2603 Give me a chance to get over this.
###2606 This feeling that I don't know myself.
###2609 That I don't control my thoughts, my actions.
###2619 You can have all the time in the world.
###2623 I'll be waiting here for the <i>Altair</i> on her return voyage.
###2631 I'm a British subject, and I'll not sing for you or any Heinie.
###2641 - Mr. Merriam. - What goes on here? What are you up to?
###2649 Are you hurt, Mr. Merriam?
###2650 This man is my officer from the <i>Altair.</i>
###2652 He's been hurt. I've got to get him back aboard.
###2722 Naturally, had I had anything to say about it, I wouldn't be here.
###2725 Evidently, Billy had the policeman bring me aboard.
###2739 Of course, sir, I realize I have no right whatsoever to be aboard the <i>Altair.</i>
###2743 I'll be glad to make arrangements to pay my passage when we reach San Pedro.
###2756 I don't wanna be aboard any more than you want me here.
###2759 But I can't do anything about it.
###2761 You can't expect me to swim.
###2763 That's quite the wrong tone, Merriam.
###2765 I was just gonna say that you'd be my guest on the trip north.
###2769 That you'll have no duties.
###2771 We'll do everything to make the voyage as comfortable as possible.
###2774 - Thank you. - In fact, Merriam...
###2776 ...l'm rather glad that you're onboard.
###2779 It will give me a chance to prove certain theories of mine.
###2782 You know, I'm sure you'll find them very interesting and instructive.
###2786 - You can learn many things from me. - I never doubted that, sir.
###2789 I'm sure you never doubted it when you told Mr. Roberts...
###2792 ...that I was a murderer and incompetent.
###2795 But we'll forget all that, Mr. Merriam.
###2797 - Thank you, captain. - Mr. Merriam.
###2801 You know, there are some captains who would hold this against you.
###2811 Oh, Raphael.
###2812 I was wondering if you got me to bed last...
###2825 Hiya, Sparks.
###2826 - I seem to have gotten myself in a kind of... - Don't come in here.
###2830 I don't want any funny business with you.
###2832 Look, Sparks, we're friends.
###2834 I need your help. Stop kidding and listen to me, will you?
###2837 Yeah, I'll stop kidding. But as for listening...
###2840 ...I tell you I'm dead serious, and I don't wanna hear a word you say.
###2844 Captain's gonna kill me, Sparks. I can see it in his face.
###2847 I'm not too dumb a guy now, Sparks.
###2850 I'm not yellow. I'm not hysterical.
###2852 I'm telling you he's gonna kill me, and I need your help.
###2855 That is hogwash.
###2857 At least do me one favor.
###2858 Send a wireless to Ms. Roberts in San Sebastián.
###2861 I can't do that. Captain's forbidden all wireless unless he personally okays them.
###2865 Don't you see? That's part of what I meant.
###2868 Yeah?
###3158 Hold it.
###3159 Move and you'll get a bullet through your abdomen.
###3162 Not a pleasant or quick death.
###3165 Perhaps you've never seen a man die that way.
###3169 But I want you to live.
###3171 I want you to learn the great lesson that I thought I'd taught you.
###3175 Authority cannot be questioned.
###3178 That's crazy talk.
###3182 I never felt more sane in my life than I do at this moment.
###3186 Who's crazy?
###3188 You, who defied me and are helpless...
###3191 ...or I, who control your destiny and the destiny of the <i>Altair</i>...
###3194 ...and all the lives onboard? - I wish Bowns...
###3197 I wish the crew could see what I see now.
###3200 - Could hear you talk. - You think I'm insane?
###3203 Yes. And they would too if they could see you now.
###3205 Raving and ranting.
###3207 I am captain.
###3209 As long as I wear these stripes...
###3211 ...there isn't a man in the crew that'll believe you or help you.
###3215 You'll find them too lazy...
###3218 ...too cowardly...
###3220 ...too disinterested.
###3222 That's what I want you to learn, Merriam.
###3224 Men are worthless cattle.
###3227 And a few men...
###3228 ...are given authority to drive them.
###3231 You can't prove that to me even with a gun, captain.
###3235 I know people aren't that way.
###3237 They're good, kind.
###3239 They help each other.
###3241 It's only hard to get them to understand.
###3243 I'll give you a chance to make them understand.
###3246 You go out there.
###3248 Go anyplace you want onboard ship.
###3250 Talk to them.
###3252 See if you can get them to help you.
###3254 See if they'll stand up with you against authority.
###3258 Why, even your friend Sparks won't help you.
###3261 Go ahead. Get out.
###3264 Try and get help against me.
###3266 Try. Try.
###3269 Try.
###3272 But, Jim, can't you understand what I'm trying to tell you?
###3282 But Louie was your pal.
###3284 The best friend you had onboard.
###3286 How do you think your pal was caught in the chain locker?
###3289 Do you think that door closed itself?
###3291 If you take my advice...
###3293 ...you'll quit trying to start trouble around here.
###3297 Boats, you're a sensible man.
###3299 Quit trying to stir up trouble with the crew against the old man.
###3303 They don't like it. They don't like you. And did you ever hear about mutiny?
###3326 Good morning, Mr. Bowns.
###3335 There isn't any lock on my cabin door. I was wondering if you could put one on.
###3374 Since you have no earthly need of this...
###3391 Listen, Tom.
###3393 You'll only get anyone you try to talk to in Dutch.
###3395 - Now, why don't you be a good guy... - Get this.
###3398 I'm desperate, Sparks.
###3400 - Why is the lock on my...? - I don't know anything.
###3402 There's only one thing you can do to please me.
###3405 And that's staying away from me and not talking to me.
###3408 Seems to me the captain is being decent...
###3410 ...after what you... - But it's true. I've got to convince you.
###3413 Or someone. The captain's a homicidal maniac.
###3416 We've got to...
###3450 - Get this off right away. - Yes, sir.
###3467 <i>I know this man's trouble.</i>
###3470 <i>I've seen the captain's hatred.</i>
###3474 <i>I know...</i>
###3476 <i>... and I will watch.</i>
###3478 <i>I will watch.</i>
###3495 Hiya, Tertius. Close the door.
###3506 I don't get this.
###3508 "Tom Merriam not aboard <i>Altair.</i> Regards."
###3511 Why would the captain want to send this to Mr. Roberts?
###3514 I don't know.
###3516 And because I don't know I'm beginning to believe your story, Tom.
###3519 This is a reply to a message sent by Roberts asking if you're aboard.
###3524 The way I figure it, maybe you're right.
###3526 Maybe the captain intends to get rid of you.
###3528 - Now you know, are you going to help me? - Yeah.
###3532 I'm gonna take this to Bowns in the morning.
###3534 It'll be enough to get him to listen to you anyhow.
###3537 Meanwhile, you better get some rest.
###3542 - So long, Tertius. - So long, and thanks.
###3605 - Do you know how to operate the wireless? - Yes, sir.
###3609 If you don't mind, I'd like you to get up and send a message for me.
###3617 I beg your pardon, sir, but why can't Sparks send it?
###3620 The message I'm asking you to send will answer that question.
###3632 Can you read, Finn?
###3636 What do you want the paper for?
###3652 I'm ready, sir.
###3665 This is a lie. You killed him. You knew he was gonna help me.
###3670 Why, you...
###3680 You killed him. I know you killed him.
###3685 He killed Sparks. Let me go.
###3688 He didn't fall overboard. Captain Stone killed him.
###3691 Just as he killed Louie. Just as he wants to kill me.
###3694 I tell you he's crazy. Can't you understand? He's crazy.
###3697 Mr. Merriam may be giving us a clue as to what's wrong with him.
###3701 - You mean the boy is...? - It's the captain.
###3703 - He's mad. - I don't know how you describe...
###3705 ...conduct such as this, Mr. Bowns. - Let me go. Please let me go.
###3709 He killed my friend. He killed Louie.
###3712 Maybe we ought to have him restrained so he won't hurt himself.
###3715 Get a rope. Truss him up and put him in his bunk.
###3722 What's all the excitement?
###3727 You couldn't be telling.
###3731 That's fine, boys. That's enough.
###3735 Better give him a sedative. Here's a needle all made up.
###3739 - Think he needs it? - He looks pretty bad. It might quiet him.
###3744 Yes, sir.
###3746 No.
###3748 Please, Mr. Bowns.
###3750 Mr. Bowns, please. No.
###3753 Mr. Bowns, please.
###3765 No, Mr. Bowns.
###3767 Please.
###3795 What do you want?
###3835 That's an odd message, surely. Can't make head nor tail of it.
###3838 With the boy here and alive. Maybe the boy is right.
###3842 I don't know. Orders is orders.
###3844 I had the boy tied up and gave him a sedative.
###3848 Maybe he ain't the crazy one at that.
###3850 - You deck officers have your problem. - Yeah.
###3854 It's going to be the problem with you fellas as well as mine.
###3857 After me, you're next in rank, and you gotta help me...
###3860 ...if the boy is right.
###3870 <i>If the boy is right.</i>
###3872 <i>If the boy is right.</i>
###3873 <i>If the boy is right.</i>
###3875 <i>If the boy is right.</i>
###3878 <i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>
###3880 <i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>
###3883 <i>Maybe the boy is right.</i>
###3885 <i>Maybe the boy is right.</i>
###3887 <i>Maybe the boy is right.</i>
###3908 <i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>
###3910 <i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>
###3913 <i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>
###3920 <i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>
###3922 <i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>
###3925 <i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>
###3927 <i>Maybe the boy is right.</i>
###3929 <i>Maybe the boy is right.</i>
###3933 <i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>
###3935 <i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>
###3939 <i>The boy is right. The boy is right.</i>
###3963 Mac, we gotta do something about this.
###3966 We can't let things stay this way.
###3969 I don't know.
###4075 <i>The boy is safe.</i>
###4079 <i>And his belief in men</i> <i>and men's essential goodness is secure.</i>
###4085 <i>He stands beside me in command.</i>
###4092 <i>All is well.</i>
###4094 Lights are bright, sir.
###4099 <i>And we are homeward bound</i> <i>to San Pedro.</i>
###4117 - For luck. - Thank you, sir.
###4119 Being a sailor, you'll need luck.
###4122 You're a sailor, all right, sir.
###4124 I don't need eyes to tell me you're a seaman outward bound.
###4128 Oh, Mr. Merriam. Mr. Merriam.
###4136 Mr. Merriam, my sister Ellen asked me to meet your ship.
###4139 How do you do?
###4141 Yes, she told me all about you.
###4156 [ENGLISH]
