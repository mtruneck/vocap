1
0:0:0,99 --> 0:0:2,889
bear over there's a guy who said his own
abolition trail is one of my best wishes


2
0:0:2,889 --> 0:0:4,54
of all time


3
0:0:4,54 --> 0:0:5,589
they want


4
0:0:5,589 --> 0:0:8,69
they can't find the governor of south
carolina


5
0:0:8,69 --> 0:0:11,849
and then he we had a report that he's
hiding the appalachian trail but that no


6
0:0:11,849 --> 0:0:13,389
one can reach it


7
0:0:13,389 --> 0:0:16,88
by immediately called bullshit they said
there's no way


8
0:0:16,88 --> 0:0:20,13
there's a governor that's inside the
united states of america a hiking trail


9
0:0:20,13 --> 0:0:21,269
we can find


10
0:0:21,269 --> 0:0:24,5
date you can find was hidden away


11
0:0:24,5 --> 0:0:27,739
look at it now in hindsight it looks
like lockhart of course it was one of


12
0:0:27,739 --> 0:0:28,37
his route


13
0:0:28,37 --> 0:0:32,8
the epidemic at that moment everybody in
the nation presently well you know it's


14
0:0:32,8 --> 0:0:37,52
probably argument relevo rabino traveler
forum on the trail grammar errors


15
0:0:37,52 --> 0:0:40,16
they have to accept everyday in
politician says


16
0:0:40,16 --> 0:0:41,51
at face value


17
0:0:41,51 --> 0:0:44,559
and i don't have to accept that ido bs
what i see it


18
0:0:44,559 --> 0:0:47,31
of white separatist covered in bs


19
0:0:47,31 --> 0:0:47,95
so


20
0:0:47,95 --> 0:0:51,31
is this christ when he doesn't resign
but of course we found out that he had a


21
0:0:51,31 --> 0:0:55,7
mistress in argentina and those who don
the visit but it gets worse


22
0:0:55,7 --> 0:0:56,25
dat used


23
0:0:56,25 --> 0:0:57,539
taxpayer blankets


24
0:0:57,539 --> 0:1:0,46
this time google school career on are


25
0:1:0,46 --> 0:1:2,94
aria first gold as a player in


26
0:1:2,94 --> 0:1:6,49
weinberger frugal and spending taxpayer
money wisely


27
0:1:6,49 --> 0:1:8,39
elisa for some using it


28
0:1:8,39 --> 0:1:10,89
the enola played have sex with my
mistress


29
0:1:10,89 --> 0:1:14,99
that he had to use it in that case women
an eight years earlier he had used


30
0:1:14,99 --> 0:1:16,239
taxpayer funded


31
0:1:16,239 --> 0:1:19,46
plane trips to go outside of his
mistress outcome


32
0:1:19,46 --> 0:1:21,4
albrecht that mentioning


33
0:1:21,4 --> 0:1:22,83
grant republics again


34
0:1:22,83 --> 0:1:25,1
you know that this cloud


35
0:1:25,1 --> 0:1:29,72
for impeachment of bill clinton he said
what clinton did ngos white that way and


36
0:1:29,72 --> 0:1:31,4
lying about it


37
0:1:31,4 --> 0:1:32,95
web reversible


38
0:1:32,95 --> 0:1:36,13
he should be driven from office he
should resign


39
0:1:36,13 --> 0:1:38,97
when he initiates resigned as governor
wouldn't take it


40
0:1:38,97 --> 0:1:42,3
what he knew he had an affair he lied
about


41
0:1:42,3 --> 0:1:44,9
so now he's back he's are in the first
district


42
0:1:44,9 --> 0:1:49,31
is south carolina that is ed deeply
conservative district that is to discuss


43
0:1:49,31 --> 0:1:52,76
former district he went to the senate
ten scott now the most conservative


44
0:1:52,76 --> 0:1:56,21
under probably in all of the united
states senate


45
0:1:56,21 --> 0:1:59,81
so who was uh... severed a runny sbc
just won the primary


46
0:1:59,81 --> 0:2:1,64
he wound up being


47
0:2:1,64 --> 0:2:5,63
curtis pasig fifty seven forty three
last night so here love you i mean just


48
0:2:5,63 --> 0:2:9,18
elizabeth kolbert abortions of course
they would go bears


49
0:2:9,18 --> 0:2:10,179
sister


50
0:2:10,179 --> 0:2:14,4
now she's lady in the polls forty seven
forty four to credibly close


51
0:2:14,4 --> 0:2:16,12
but we haven't had the campaign he had


52
0:2:16,12 --> 0:2:19,359
and it is very conservative so it is
very likely


53
0:2:19,359 --> 0:2:20,659
now mark sanford


54
0:2:20,659 --> 0:2:23,419
could be back in the united states
congress


55
0:2:23,419 --> 0:2:26,509
by the way did republicans seem at
rensselaer sanford


56
0:2:26,509 --> 0:2:28,989
you know what he was in congress before
he was governor


57
0:2:28,989 --> 0:2:31,879
he said onli firm believer in term
limits


58
0:2:31,879 --> 0:2:33,93
three terms than i am out


59
0:2:33,93 --> 0:2:36,509
except for when i come back it


60
0:2:36,509 --> 0:2:39,959
he's going to force beyond the three
terms now


61
0:2:39,959 --> 0:2:41,23
he's mark sanford


62
0:2:41,23 --> 0:2:44,239
so uh... he's now of course


63
0:2:44,239 --> 0:2:46,239
brown got so all this is ok


64
0:2:46,239 --> 0:2:47,449
let's hear from


65
0:2:47,449 --> 0:2:50,609
you know one thing that consist of into
this campaign is


66
0:2:50,609 --> 0:2:54,449
to acknowledge the fact that that that i
feel back in two thousand nine


67
0:2:54,449 --> 0:2:58,19
but there's been a lot of time since it
was a great sermon just uh... last


68
0:2:58,19 --> 0:2:59,99
sunday


69
0:2:59,99 --> 0:3:2,459
if the church that i can where he said
you know do the events in your life


70
0:3:2,459 --> 0:3:6,779
refined or define your life and i think
that political opponents national enough


71
0:3:6,779 --> 0:3:11,279
wanna make any event define your life
you know what i think we find whether to


72
0:3:11,279 --> 0:3:15,459
you me or any of us out there will have
different events when we wish we could


73
0:3:15,459 --> 0:3:18,369
have done things differently we wish we
could handle them better


74
0:3:18,369 --> 0:3:22,1
but in fact they help us to read illsley
were finalized makers that much better


75
0:3:22,1 --> 0:3:26,509
person maybe walk out into the the the
arena of politics a bit more humble than


76
0:3:26,509 --> 0:3:30,54
we were before yachts also most
democrats eliot spitzer anybody we know


77
0:3:30,54 --> 0:3:32,209
you're the well-intentioned dog


78
0:3:32,209 --> 0:3:35,11
you're gonna camera because there's a
lot of family values


79
0:3:35,11 --> 0:3:36,869
this guy was on family values


80
0:3:36,869 --> 0:3:39,759
well you know there was a moment where i
slipped up you mean the moment where you


81
0:3:39,759 --> 0:3:41,8
repeatedly went to argentina


82
0:3:41,8 --> 0:3:43,9
have sex with your mistress and share
your white


83
0:3:43,9 --> 0:3:47,529
acting iran on family values your entire
political here


84
0:3:47,529 --> 0:3:49,17
all of those moments


85
0:3:49,17 --> 0:3:52,8
but always with the republican and
surrounding the star began in terms of


86
0:3:52,8 --> 0:3:53,19
care


87
0:3:53,19 --> 0:3:54,409
anymore either


88
0:3:54,409 --> 0:3:55,7
so how has this event


89
0:3:55,7 --> 0:3:59,83
changed to as a as a public servant
changed you as a menu said


90
0:3:59,83 --> 0:4:3,789
it might make you more empathetic


91
0:4:3,789 --> 0:4:6,669
how would you be a better public servant
because of what you went through and


92
0:4:6,669 --> 0:4:8,989
because of of this scandal


93
0:4:8,989 --> 0:4:12,599
i think the do too many people in
politics who think that they know it all


94
0:4:12,599 --> 0:4:15,769
uh... and i think that the project this
whole image of


95
0:4:15,769 --> 0:4:17,31
of perfection


96
0:4:17,31 --> 0:4:22,539
that the uh... the perfect family move
the perfect person the perfect fit


97
0:4:22,539 --> 0:4:23,839
the reality is


98
0:4:23,839 --> 0:4:25,52
none of us are perfect


99
0:4:25,52 --> 0:4:26,13
and i think


100
0:4:26,13 --> 0:4:30,33
the the sooner we recognize their inner
cells as a senator who we begin the real


101
0:4:30,33 --> 0:4:32,949
conversations with other people


102
0:4:32,949 --> 0:4:36,579
sentence every cell pastel questions
what is the white house correspondent


103
0:4:36,579 --> 0:4:37,899
what the hell is that


104
0:4:37,899 --> 0:4:40,75

leader of the peril


107
0:4:43,6 --> 0:4:44,25

108
0:4:44,25 --> 0:4:45,44
events in lawrence


109
0:4:45,44 --> 0:4:49,5

but there's got again


140
0:6:9,58 --> 0:6:12,319
well wonderful coincidence that it


141
0:6:12,319 --> 0:6:14,269
since the founding


142
0:6:14,269 --> 0:6:17,749

what was in south carolina


143
0:6:17,749 --> 0:6:21,9

144
0:6:21,9 --> 0:6:22,749
people when you have a guy

147
0:6:26,639 --> 0:6:28,289
less distance behind


148
0:6:28,289 --> 0:6:32,379
what do you say it all in all friend i'm
second chances might not have also been


149
0:6:32,379 --> 0:6:37,97
but propaganda logs it year discussion
that quiet


150
0:6:37,97 --> 0:6:39,48
he should be embarrassed


151
0:6:39,48 --> 0:6:42,65
anybody want from a south carolina ought
to be embarrassed it should be


152
0:6:42,65 --> 0:6:48,34
prohibited from advert measuring family
values again or let alone talking about


153
0:6:48,34 --> 0:6:50,449

current television


157

accounting but dot please please again

otherwise out your naked argument

battle groups


166
0:7:26,81 --> 0:7:27,48

167
0:7:27,48 --> 0:7:31,1

sign


169
0:7:34,2 --> 0:7:36,629

0:7:43,199 --> 0:7:45,629
unfaithful until spouse


173
0:7:45,629 --> 0:7:49,15
the spending other people's money to go
get america's while those are those of


174
0:7:49,15 --> 0:7:51,979
us is not about the versus rd a south
carolina


175
0:7:51,979 --> 0:7:54,889
furqan outrageous man and by the way


176
0:7:54,889 --> 0:7:58,8
just the rub it in your face you know
what marcia evernote he brought out his


177
0:7:58,8 --> 0:8:3,58
mistress for his victory celebration and
by the way


178
0:8:3,58 --> 0:8:8,199
on on morning shows twenty cent all i
know she was indeed a alok wat out


179
0:8:8,199 --> 0:8:10,139
awhile anomaly will like


180
0:8:10,139 --> 0:8:14,369
yet really possible at what time has
been tapped unto richard off course that


181
0:8:14,369 --> 0:8:15,34
land that


182
0:8:15,34 --> 0:8:17,949
you'll believe has got to say it


183
0:8:17,949 --> 0:8:33,38
all right well watches mistress the


184
0:8:33,38 --> 0:8:35,38
pampered


185
0:8:35,38 --> 0:8:36,43
the


186
0:8:36,43 --> 0:8:40,23
do buyers though


187
0:8:40,23 --> 0:8:41,65
so has either put


188
0:8:41,65 --> 0:8:48,22
and there's a lot of republican guys in
south carolina god you know might erode


189
0:8:48,22 --> 0:8:53,56
my guess is is also the bill of women in
south carolina or like i do not care


190
0:8:53,56 --> 0:8:58,15
you'd left your wife to be with that you
know woman right there high now you are


191
0:8:58,15 --> 0:8:59,41
but in our face and


192
0:8:59,41 --> 0:9:0,48
known for its own


193
0:9:0,48 --> 0:11:0,48
what what was a elizabeth kolbert bush
you know that sounds pretty good
