###26 ADRI MURGUIA: Despite removing himself from the society,
###28 Faustino's lifestyle began to change when civilization
###30 started catching up with him.
###32 Just two years ago, the government found out he had
###35 guns on his property.
###36 And they cut a deal with him in which he would exchange
###38 them for solar panels, which he doesn't really use.
###41 That was only the first in a series of changes that would
###43 lead him to modify his lifestyle.

###216 ADRI MURGUIA: Perhaps the biggest change that has
###218 affected Faustino is the unlikely friendship with an
###220 outsider whom he's given permission
###222 to live on his land.

###332 ADRI MURGUIA: We're shearing the sheep.
###334 And then we're going to kill it because we're going on an
###336 expedition tomorrow to the Green Lake.
###338 And we need to take food.
###341 So we're taking this guy.

###481 survival of this land.
###483 There was absolutely nothing for us to eat at the Green
###485 Lake, which was a special place for him that he hadn't
###488 returned to for many years.
