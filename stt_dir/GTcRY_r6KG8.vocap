###14 Tumblr is a good place for inspiration.
###16 I definitely support Tumblr.
###18 There's the other side, where people are like, there's no
###21 creativity.
###21 It's just a reblog generation.
###25 But what's wrong with having a visual identity that's based
###28 on other people?
###29 It's just curating.
###30 Everyone's just being mini curators, in a sense.
###33 I don't necessarily think that's bad.
###37 I'm bad at eye contact.
###39 I can get awkward.
###40 But I'll try.
###41 I'll try to keep it here.

###89 I was in college and taking a lot of social media classes
###94 and media theory classes.
###95 And Marcus and I met on a message board.
###99 We both made music as solo artists.
###103 And then it was just a fun experiment.
###104 Let's try to collaborate on a remix.
###106 And so we did a remix.
###107 It was fun.
###108 And then it kept going, had a snowball effect.
###110 Why even stop?
###111 People are enjoying it.
###112 It was fun.
###114 It came out of experimentation, I think, of
###116 can we do an internet group?
###117 Can this just exist online?
###120 But it was cool.
###121 We brought it into the IRL sphere.
###123 And we played shows in Europe.
###125 It was amazing.
###126 It was really fun.
###127 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###134 I was on this tour with some friends.
###137 We'd played in Tijuana on a Saturday night.
###142 So I had no cell service, nothing.
###143 We were in Tijuana.
###144 We got back to the hotel room in San Diego at 4:00 AM.
###146 And I just look on Twitter.
###149 Friends of mine are like, great job Rihanna, stealing
###152 Jerome's visual aesthetic.
###154 [MUSIC - RIHANNA, "DIAMONDS"]
###158 I watched it.
###159 I was like, yeah.
###162 I get it.
###163 I get why people are going to associate that with some of
###165 the videos I've made.
###166 But I wasn't particularly offended.
###169 Thinking about the context more and more, I was like,
###171 this is kind of fucked up.
###172 But then also a side of me was like, why
###175 wouldn't this happen?
###176 Of course this happened.
###177 This happens with everything.
###177 This isn't the first time this has happened.
###179 Do you not want it to get big?
###181 I was like, this is actually cool.
###182 This is the best looking Saturday Night Live
###184 performance in my eyes.
###186 I loved it.
###188 But taking out of context, if you have like a 50-year-old
###193 guy who's never seen that before, seeing that aesthetic
###195 on Saturday Night Live for the first time, not understanding
###197 where it's coming from, see it as being problematic.
###200 But Buzzfeed or Buzzmedia, or whatever that site's called,
###203 they used me as the example.
###205 They could have used--
###207 hundreds of artists have that same style.
###209 It's not really specific to me.
###211 Seapunk as a word was coined in 2011.
###214 That was just a buzz word that people wanted to assign to
###216 this whole visual aesthetic.
###218 I think what people are talking about when they say
###221 seapunk is this Tumblr aesthetic of early web 1.0
###225 art, a lot of water visuals, and this bright
###228 pastel-y color scheme.
###230 But it's definitely referential to early web 1.0
###233 stuff, GeoCities, Angelfire, stuff like that.
###235 But I know I'm not doing it justice to the people who
###237 really identify with seapunk, because I don't
###241 identify with it.
###242 But they, I know, have their own belief system, which you
###245 can read about on the internet.
###246 Now people like know what you mean when you say seapunk
###250 aesthetic, or whatever.
###251 But it can be a little frustrating.
###254 [MUSIC - LOL BOYS, "123"]
###262 This 123 video I did was like this song, kind
###264 of this club song.
###265 But then the visual representation of the song
###268 kind of made it into a more interesting thing.
###270 [MUSIC - LOL BOYS, "123"]
###277 I don't believe in nostalgia, romanticism.
###279 I think you have to take that stuff.
###282 And just placing it in this day and age makes it, I guess,
###286 taking it out of context, making it fun.
###287 And even if people think it looks shitty, it's
###290 beautiful in a way.
###291 That style, I think there's a certain kind of beauty in it,
###295 just on an aesthetic level.
###296 It's nice to look at that kind of stuff.
###298 Maybe it is because it's nostalgic.
###300 But it's still make sense in a modern context.
###302 [MUSIC - LOL BOYS, "123"]
###306 I really like screenshots of just funny things that happen
###309 online, whether it's a pop-up ad or just ads in general.
###312 If you take that out of context, it's like someone
###314 designed that.
###316 Someone designed a pop-up ad.
###317 And so to put it just on your Tumblr without it being
###320 annoying, it just gives it a new life, I think.
###323 Skrillex had seen--
###325 my management had showed him my website,
###326 showed him my videos.
###327 And he really liked it.
###327 He said he he wanted me to do something.
###329 He had this website he wanted to do it.
###330 He's just like yeah, make it anything you want.
###333 It can be like old GeoCities style.
###335 It could be whatever you want.
###337 We did the whole thing in two nights.
###339 It was an amazing experience, and super fun.
###341 It was fun.
###342 We were doing it for Skrillex.
###343 A lot of people got mad at that, too.
###346 You sold out.
###348 No.
###348 But it wasn't like we did that and there was this art
###351 direction team.
###353 He was talking to us.
###354 It was a direct dialogue.
###355 And he understands the whole thing.
###358 This is Santee Alley.
###361 This is where you can find Twitter chains, Angry Bird
###363 chains, a lot of chains, internet things.
###368 Do you have any 3D hologram cases that change?
###370 
###375 That's like the club look of 2013 right there.
###381 [MUSIC - LOL BOYS, "CHANGES (FT HEART STREETS)"]
###383 
###392 Kind of with the last EP, the EP changes and it was kind of
###394 like the crux.
###395 We were really happy with it.
###396 It was the pinnacle of what we thought we could do as this
###400 internet group.
###401 [MUSIC - LOL BOYS, "CHANGES (FT HEART STREETS)"]
###402 
###411 I had an idea of doing a screen shot video,
###414 kind of like that.
###415 I love that people lip sync on YouTube, and
###418 that's a whole sub-genre.
###419 That's such a niche.
###420 So I wanted to take that, and place it in like this is an
###423 official music video with people doing it.
###425 And then the whole like meta thing of making it on top of a
###429 desktop came to me after.
###431 So then yeah, those people, I just sent out a mass email of
###434 musicians and friends I had, seeing if they
###436 were down to do it.
###438 I was stoked, very happy with the response.
###441 It was cool.
###441 It was really fun to do.
###443 It's fun to collaborate.
###445 They are just as much directors in the
###447 music video as I am.
###449 Because I didn't know what I was going to get back.
###451 I said listen to the song.
###453 I didn't even say for how long do have to do it.
###455 I said listen to this song, and record
###457 yourself reacting to it.
###458 So some people lip sync.
###459 Some people don't.
###460 I sent them the lyrics.
###461 It was super fun.
###462 It was a collaborative thing.
###464 I plan on doing that with my next videos, to do something
###466 that's collaborative with other artists.
###467 [MUSIC - LOL BOYS, "CHANGES (FT HEART STREETS)"]
###469 
###473 I think anything that's on a computer, if you see it on
###475 your screen, it's on your computer.
###477 Even if it's on the internet, it's still on your screen.
###480 So I think you own it.
###482 That's part of why computers and the internet is great.
###484 Because it's modular.
###487 You can just take whatever you want.
###489 That's kind of the whole thing.
###490 If you view the internet as kind of this collaborative art
###493 project that keeps-- everyone is just
###494 stealing from each other.
###495 And it keeps getting crazier and crazier and crazier.
###498 I'm OK with that.
###499 That's a fun thing.
###500 It makes it exciting.
###501 [CHATTER]
###506 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###514 I think the persona I project as Jerome LOL is more of--
###519 it's humor.
###520 It's funny.
###521 But it's still me.
###522 I'm still that every day.
###523 But more and more I thinking of it in the third person.
###527 I am more careful with what I'm posting online.
###530 That's kind of the beauty of the internet, though, is you
###532 get to choose what you want to broadcast to people.
###535 The more I'm getting into it, especially since I've gone
###538 solo, the more I view it as this third person thing, which
###542 keeps me sane for sure.
###543 Because I'm not always a crazy internet person, I guess.
###548 It makes you super self aware, I think.
###551 The first time you use Facebook, you have the option
###553 of, what's your profile picture?
###555 Even choosing your profile picture, that's a statement of
###558 how you view yourself.
###560 It's a very self reflexive, self aware activity.
###564 It's insane, now little kids are doing that.
###566 I feel like everyone is becoming self aware in the
###570 past few years.
###571 It's just going to keep getting more
###572 and more hyper aware.
###575 I've been on vacation where I have stepped away, but I
###577 really don't like it.
###578 
###582 I don't think it's a physical addiction.
###584 Definitely it's not.
###584 I don't get sick.
###585 And I don't have physical withdrawals.
###587 I'm not throwing up if I don't check my email.
###590 It's an obsession, more than an addiction, I think.
###592 I'm obsessed with the internet.
###593 I need to see what's going on.
###595 I need to be connected with those people that I like.
###598 And I don't want to miss anything.
###599 I'm addicted to the internet completely.
###601 I'm on it way too much.
###603 But maybe not way too much.
###604 I enjoy my time on the internet.
###607 I have stepped away.
###608 I have gone on vacation and been away from the internet
###610 for five days.
###611 It's refreshing.
###612 You come back and then you realize, I don't need all this
###616 bullshit, really.
###616 But then right away when you get back into it,
###618 you're back in it.
###619 So I think it's healthy once in while, to get away.
###622 And to know that you can get away.
###624 And it's not the end of the world if you miss a few emails
###626 here or there.
###627 If it's a day where I don't have anything to do and I'm
###630 just in the studio, probably 11 hours.
###641 Yeah, I spend about 11 hours a day on the internet or in
###644 front of a screen.
