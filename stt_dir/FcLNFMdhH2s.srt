1
0:0:0,6 --> 0:0:3,51
because a week elise that we find out
more information about what we've done


2
0:0:3,51 --> 0:0:7,68
in iraq of course millions of documents
were released uh... the reason bramley


3
0:0:7,68 --> 0:0:12,699
manning faces at least twenty years
maybe more up to a life sentence


4
0:0:12,699 --> 0:0:16,139
uh... is because the get heat revealed
information the government did you want


5
0:0:16,139 --> 0:0:17,979
you know it's arleigh secrets


6
0:0:17,979 --> 0:0:20,72
well the guardian has done a terrific


7
0:0:20,72 --> 0:0:22,859
piece along with bbc


8
0:0:22,859 --> 0:0:24,19
uh... headache


9
0:0:24,19 --> 0:0:25,0
at that


10
0:0:25,0 --> 0:0:29,659
shows exactly what we're off to his ad
features two guys colonel james


11
0:0:29,659 --> 0:0:34,21
kaufman retired and colonel james still
retired


12
0:0:34,21 --> 0:0:37,65
they were quite retired because they
went back into iraq and work with


13
0:0:37,65 --> 0:0:39,18
general petraeus


14
0:0:39,18 --> 0:0:40,8
and the rest of our forces


15
0:0:40,8 --> 0:0:44,86
to help the iraqis set up special police
commandos


16
0:0:44,86 --> 0:0:45,79
now those


17
0:0:45,79 --> 0:0:47,25
special police units


18
0:0:47,25 --> 0:0:49,84
one-up doing a tremendous amount of
torture


19
0:0:49,84 --> 0:0:51,99
and oh by the way some desk once


20
0:0:51,99 --> 0:0:55,14
in fact at the height of the civil war
in iraq


21
0:0:55,14 --> 0:0:58,58
three thousand people were showing up
dead


22
0:0:58,58 --> 0:1:2,4
every single moms


23
0:1:2,4 --> 0:1:4,49
are was name enough to believe at the
time


24
0:1:4,49 --> 0:1:8,41
that hey listen we open up that
pandora's box so we were responsible for


25
0:1:8,41 --> 0:1:10,0
what happened afterwards


26
0:1:10,0 --> 0:1:13,5
but i didn't think that we actually
participated in


27
0:1:13,5 --> 0:1:17,99
well it turns out that we at least gave
tacit approval and oftentimes active


28
0:1:17,99 --> 0:1:19,14
approval


29
0:1:19,14 --> 0:1:21,72
for exactly some of the most hideous
things


30
0:1:21,72 --> 0:1:23,78
that were being done in iraq


31
0:1:23,78 --> 0:1:24,989
and when you see that


32
0:1:24,989 --> 0:1:28,3
district colonel james till you begin to
understand why


33
0:1:28,3 --> 0:1:33,23
first of all he was the same exact i we
sat down the el salvador


34
0:1:33,23 --> 0:1:34,46
to set up the


35
0:1:34,46 --> 0:1:36,15
death squads there


36
0:1:36,15 --> 0:1:38,12
and guess what i have an el salvador


37
0:1:38,12 --> 0:1:41,59
a tremendous civil war just like in iraq


38
0:1:41,59 --> 0:1:44,18
where there are desk was and then
retaliation


39
0:1:44,18 --> 0:1:49,22
and ambitious cycle of violence so why
not repeat that mistake in fact


40
0:1:49,22 --> 0:1:52,15
celebrated castio as a senior d_e_a_
agent


41
0:1:52,15 --> 0:1:56,52
when he got that still was characterized
another office of the hour on spoke his


42
0:1:56,52 --> 0:1:57,86
reset


43
0:1:57,86 --> 0:2:1,29
i first heard about colonel james still
gonna rock and i said


44
0:2:1,29 --> 0:2:2,84
they're gonna implement what is known


45
0:2:2,84 --> 0:2:5,26
as a salvadoran option in iraq


46
0:2:5,26 --> 0:2:8,979
and that's exactly what happened and i
was devastated 'cause i knew the


47
0:2:8,979 --> 0:2:11,43
atrocities that we're going to current
iraq


48
0:2:11,43 --> 0:2:13,229
which we do have occurred


49
0:2:13,229 --> 0:2:15,889
in south howell salvador


50
0:2:15,889 --> 0:2:18,269
and of course it turns out he was right
about that


51
0:2:18,269 --> 0:2:21,739
in case you're wondering you forgot also
there was a long time ago


52
0:2:21,739 --> 0:2:25,569
how many people be killed in the war now
some of the wrist most country in the


53
0:2:25,569 --> 0:2:27,49
latin america


54
0:2:27,49 --> 0:2:30,249
seventy five thousand s


55
0:2:30,249 --> 0:2:32,55
thanks a lot colonel steel really
appreciated


56
0:2:32,55 --> 0:2:36,45
so of course dick cheney rumsfeld look
at them go mission accomplished nicely


57
0:2:36,45 --> 0:2:38,2
done right wing death squads


58
0:2:38,2 --> 0:2:39,669
let's enum over iraq


59
0:2:39,669 --> 0:2:43,94
throughout the guardian piece you see
rumsfeld lavish ng preys on steel


60
0:2:43,94 --> 0:2:46,749
all we've got the right guy in iraq


61
0:2:46,749 --> 0:2:49,89
this guidance steel he's doing the right
things for us


62
0:2:49,89 --> 0:2:51,279
and of course


63
0:2:51,279 --> 0:2:55,249
cheney had worked with him in panama as
well when he was part of the george h w


64
0:2:55,249 --> 0:2:56,799
bush administration


65
0:2:56,799 --> 0:3:0,389
uh... and by the way so now so there was
thirty five thousand as having doubts


66
0:3:0,389 --> 0:3:2,199
that we have in iraq


67
0:3:2,199 --> 0:3:6,46
well according to those same documents
that were leaked through with the leaks


68
0:3:6,46 --> 0:3:10,339
but is the government estimates so it is
actually incredibly conservative ulo


69
0:3:10,339 --> 0:3:15,649
one hundred nine thousand and thirty two
deaths in iraq between oh four oh nine


70
0:3:15,649 --> 0:3:18,29
including over sixty six


71
0:3:18,29 --> 0:3:19,399
fallows and


72
0:3:19,399 --> 0:3:21,379
civilians


73
0:3:21,379 --> 0:3:23,99
civilians


74
0:3:23,99 --> 0:3:25,109
we must be sold proud


75
0:3:25,109 --> 0:3:29,619
not even associated press has both of
those numbers at higher livid over a


76
0:3:29,619 --> 0:3:31,369
hundred ten thousand that's


77
0:3:31,369 --> 0:3:35,279
course some other organizations in the
past may be the best


78
0:3:35,279 --> 0:3:38,87
up to six hundred thousand i mean the
scene one estimate over a million


79
0:3:38,87 --> 0:3:42,389
but everyone agrees at least a hundred
and ten thousand deaths


80
0:3:42,389 --> 0:3:45,529
including a tremendous numbers for
itself


81
0:3:45,529 --> 0:3:49,939
where these guys are these connected to
java trails and higher correct


82
0:3:49,939 --> 0:3:53,239
pearl jam's cough and cold sore in
stripes that he was quote


83
0:3:53,239 --> 0:3:55,999
the traces eyes and years


84
0:3:55,999 --> 0:3:58,529
out on the ground in iraq


85
0:3:58,529 --> 0:3:59,979
fantastic


86
0:3:59,979 --> 0:4:0,84
uh... now


87
0:4:0,84 --> 0:4:2,6
let me go to


88
0:4:2,6 --> 0:4:3,169
the video from


89
0:4:3,169 --> 0:4:5,23
uh... this series todd green tree


90
0:4:5,23 --> 0:4:8,369
who's gonna talk about colonel steals
role


91
0:4:8,369 --> 0:4:9,899
it'll still rescue vehicle


92
0:4:9,899 --> 0:4:15,479
who understands how to conduct
intelligence driven operations projects


93
0:4:15,479 --> 0:4:20,9
operational sells insurgency terrorist
organization


94
0:4:20,9 --> 0:4:22,4
so he knows how to operate that


95
0:4:22,4 --> 0:4:25,659
is a good to be a successful because i a
definition of success right


96
0:4:25,659 --> 0:4:28,9
but one thing is clear


97
0:4:28,9 --> 0:4:29,8
he's doing this


98
0:4:29,8 --> 0:4:33,5
at the behest of don so they came in job
but resin fact


99
0:4:33,5 --> 0:4:35,83
gentle mont hubbard elsa mari


100
0:4:35,83 --> 0:4:40,59
who was uh... senior general iraq at the
time said


101
0:4:40,59 --> 0:4:43,729
they worked hand-in-hand now that's a
sure frantic hoffman


102
0:4:43,729 --> 0:4:45,969
and uh... temperate rain is


103
0:4:45,969 --> 0:4:47,63
i never saw them apart


104
0:4:47,63 --> 0:4:52,139
in the fifth forty or fifty times i saw
them inside the detention centers


105
0:4:52,139 --> 0:4:54,409
they do everything that was going on
there


106
0:4:54,409 --> 0:4:56,169
the torture


107
0:4:56,169 --> 0:5:0,4
hobo kinds of torture


108
0:5:0,4 --> 0:5:0,91
general


109
0:5:0,91 --> 0:5:4,159
ought not to be was ahead of the special
commandos


110
0:5:4,159 --> 0:5:8,3
so that anybody knows what i have been
it was ham he's a guy who ordered all of


111
0:5:8,3 --> 0:5:8,77
it


112
0:5:8,77 --> 0:5:10,29
he says quote


113
0:5:10,29 --> 0:5:11,999
until i left


114
0:5:11,999 --> 0:5:14,99
that america's new about everything i
did


115
0:5:14,99 --> 0:5:17,719
they knew what was going on in the
interrogation is


116
0:5:17,719 --> 0:5:21,539
and they knew the detainees


117
0:5:21,539 --> 0:5:24,42
so did we know what was happening you
better


118
0:5:24,42 --> 0:5:26,29
no question about it


119
0:5:26,29 --> 0:5:29,509
jumble one guy that i also mari again
quote


120
0:5:29,509 --> 0:5:31,9
they were secret never declared


121
0:5:31,9 --> 0:5:37,2
but the american top brass in iraqi
leadership new all about these prisons


122
0:5:37,2 --> 0:5:40,129
the things that went on their
controlling murder


123
0:5:40,129 --> 0:5:43,69
porter the hardly a sort of porter


124
0:5:43,69 --> 0:5:46,24
i've ever seen


125
0:5:46,24 --> 0:5:50,78
so they sought and they said the
americans absolutely nobody researching


126
0:5:50,78 --> 0:5:51,6
deporting


127
0:5:51,6 --> 0:5:55,3
detention centers let alone the best was
roaming the country


128
0:5:55,3 --> 0:6:0,49
so then we go to general montevideo
somali one more time he says


129
0:6:0,49 --> 0:6:2,419
now beginning to describe the torture


130
0:6:2,419 --> 0:6:6,8
i remember a forty-year-old was tied to
a libros columns


131
0:6:6,8 --> 0:6:9,419
and he was tied up with his legs above
its head


132
0:6:9,419 --> 0:6:10,939
whose whole body was blue


133
0:6:10,939 --> 0:6:12,88
because of the impact of the cables


134
0:6:12,88 --> 0:6:15,149
with which he had been beat


135
0:6:15,149 --> 0:6:18,34
now there's more videos explaining some
of the torture


136
0:6:18,34 --> 0:6:23,74
including by american journalist and
western journalists there at the time


137
0:6:23,74 --> 0:6:27,5
they were too extreme detainees for
information on the insurgency


138
0:6:27,5 --> 0:6:32,129
this year's to spin on the other side of
things also that you know as you see


139
0:6:32,129 --> 0:6:36,489
this is not staying until the discomfort
level


140
0:6:36,489 --> 0:6:40,889
first of all the things that went on
that at least ratings and about


141
0:6:40,889 --> 0:6:45,849
courtroom provides the idea sort of sort
of thing i have received but two dot he


142
0:6:45,849 --> 0:6:47,439
is


143
0:6:47,439 --> 0:6:51,469
so does present but i revert with the
time was on assignment from the new york


144
0:6:51,469 --> 0:6:52,499
times


145
0:6:52,499 --> 0:6:55,759
another reporter peter masa also
assignment there


146
0:6:55,759 --> 0:6:58,3
and they saw what they're all eyes what
was happening


147
0:6:58,3 --> 0:7:0,229
more on that


148
0:7:0,229 --> 0:7:6,15
lena lou linda library into here in
seattle and i was making rice and tomato


149
0:7:6,15 --> 0:7:9,68
terrible screens this initial all our
lives


150
0:7:9,68 --> 0:7:12,9
but it wasn't they're kind of religious
ecstasy or something like that these


151
0:7:12,9 --> 0:7:16,24
were the first things that uh...
tenncare


152
0:7:16,24 --> 0:7:18,629
business to start shutting


153
0:7:18,629 --> 0:7:20,93
that at the clock willing for the
streets


154
0:7:20,93 --> 0:7:22,99
these last two screens online


155
0:7:22,99 --> 0:7:25,49
house lost


156
0:7:25,49 --> 0:7:29,29
the manager and their seeming to enjoy
um... the prisoner screams


157
0:7:29,29 --> 0:7:31,64
was a man who conducted those operations


158
0:7:31,64 --> 0:7:35,51
he's also the same one that i quoted
earlier saying that america's new


159
0:7:35,51 --> 0:7:37,669
everything i did


160
0:7:37,669 --> 0:7:39,67
and those other two were reporters


161
0:7:39,67 --> 0:7:40,93
who couldn't believe


162
0:7:40,93 --> 0:7:42,879
that they would be interviewing steel


163
0:7:42,879 --> 0:7:47,449
and there would be a blot of pooled near
the detainees is still would be


164
0:7:47,449 --> 0:7:50,18
would find any relevant would move on
there was one


165
0:7:50,18 --> 0:7:54,95
pepper tubular time according to those
two regulus present peter mah sin and


166
0:7:54,95 --> 0:7:57,74
some other generals that were there
including the gentleman i


167
0:7:57,74 --> 0:8:2,569
quoted earlier more montana also mari
saying i was well colonel steel


168
0:8:2,569 --> 0:8:3,749
they open the door


169
0:8:3,749 --> 0:8:7,669
and you see a guy hanging upside-down
bloodied


170
0:8:7,669 --> 0:8:8,4
this note


171
0:8:8,4 --> 0:8:11,789
calmly closes the door and moves on


172
0:8:11,789 --> 0:8:13,439
he knows what's happening


173
0:8:13,439 --> 0:8:15,919
so what in fact that they did


174
0:8:15,919 --> 0:8:18,77
let's hear from one of the guys who was
to work


175
0:8:18,77 --> 0:8:20,539
schindler everyone though


176
0:8:20,539 --> 0:8:24,759
will be blindfolded and handcuffed
behind our banks and then they would be


177
0:8:24,759 --> 0:8:29,979
to shovel sometimes would be tied to a
space wall will be home from the ceiling


178
0:8:29,979 --> 0:8:34,37
by opponents of the national news will
be dissipated and wallow


179
0:8:34,37 --> 0:8:36,97

stamping ahead asking about my wife
saying they would bring her head


182
0:8:46,85 --> 0:8:51,7
i remember adams how they came into the
library but he told captains arriving


183
0:8:51,7 --> 0:8:55,99
captain allen resume the prisoners
turned dislocated shoulders like this is


184
0:8:55,99 --> 0:8:59,24
because people were having to undergo
surgery when they were released in the


185
0:8:59,24 --> 0:9:1,16
library


186
0:9:1,16 --> 0:9:5,33
at one point they actually ran a reality
show in iraq in is unbelievable


187
0:9:5,33 --> 0:9:8,0
with a we show the tortured detainees


188
0:9:8,0 --> 0:9:11,92
kind of rubbing it in people's faces is
what we do so you better watch out


189
0:9:11,92 --> 0:9:15,57
now that was the height of the sectarian
conflict with thousands are dying every


190

is he not merciful


195
0:9:26,22 --> 0:9:27,569
now if you don't believe


196
0:9:27,569 --> 0:9:30,8
iraqi generals are you going to believe
the reporters a you don't believe the


197
0:9:30,8 --> 0:9:32,13

some u_s_ soldiers and troops


200

203
0:9:44,57 --> 0:9:46,66
it was like the nazis


204
0:9:46,66 --> 0:9:48,42
the gestapo basically


205
0:9:48,42 --> 0:9:49,79
they the commandos


206
0:9:49,79 --> 0:9:53,55
would essentially torture anybody that
they had good reason to suspect


207
0:9:53,55 --> 0:9:56,97
knew something was part of this urgency
were supporting it


208
0:9:56,97 --> 0:9:58,85
and people knew about that


209
0:9:58,85 --> 0:10:0,7
in saying that


210
0:10:0,7 --> 0:10:2,6
the troops knew all about the americans
knew about it


211
0:10:2,6 --> 0:10:4,64
the commanders knew all about about it


212
0:10:4,64 --> 0:10:8,59
one of these brave u_s_ troops execute
on the record is names neal smith


213
0:10:8,59 --> 0:10:11,7
there's a twenty-year-old mc medications
some are


214
0:10:11,7 --> 0:10:16,71
he's now born again christian and trying
to make amends for what he thinks he did


215
0:10:16,71 --> 0:10:18,6
in rak nieces qu


216
0:10:18,6 --> 0:10:22,19
what was pretty widely known in our
battalion deftly inopportune


217
0:10:22,19 --> 0:10:24,829
was that they were pretty violin with
their interrogation is


218
0:10:24,829 --> 0:10:27,67
they would be people shocked electric
shock


219
0:10:27,67 --> 0:10:29,72
stabbed them i don't know what else


220
0:10:29,72 --> 0:10:32,94
sounds like pretty awful things


221
0:10:32,94 --> 0:10:34,42
one last soldier


222
0:10:34,42 --> 0:10:37,49
who was actually handing over people to
be torture


223
0:10:37,49 --> 0:10:39,39
these detainees said quote


224
0:10:39,39 --> 0:10:41,13
if somebody gets arrested


225
0:10:41,13 --> 0:10:43,41
and we hand them over to mold


226
0:10:43,41 --> 0:10:46,78
they're going to get their balls hooked
electrocuted


227
0:10:46,78 --> 0:10:50,94
where they're going to get beaten or
raped up an ass with a coke bottle


228
0:10:50,94 --> 0:10:56,28
or something like that


229
0:10:56,28 --> 0:10:58,4
what we


230
0:10:58,4 --> 0:11:1,34
the right wing that's wise to do in el
salvador


231
0:11:1,34 --> 0:11:4,0
that led to a broadcast civil war there


232
0:11:4,0 --> 0:11:5,99
with seventy five thousand dead


233
0:11:5,99 --> 0:11:8,6
we get a d_n_a_ in iraq


234
0:11:8,6 --> 0:11:9,36
and what we have


235
0:11:9,36 --> 0:11:11,27
the same exact results


236
0:11:11,27 --> 0:11:13,269
desk once courtroom


237
0:11:13,269 --> 0:11:15,47
elimination of political opponents


238
0:11:15,47 --> 0:11:16,62
and what happened


239
0:11:16,62 --> 0:11:18,529
a hundred and ten thousand dead


240
0:11:18,529 --> 0:11:20,28
at least


241
0:11:20,28 --> 0:11:28,2
we for the love of god stop sending
colonel steeled into these situations


242
0:11:28,2 --> 0:11:30,29
this is what we found out about our
government


243
0:11:30,29 --> 0:11:33,24
this is what our democracy was up to


244
0:11:33,24 --> 0:11:36,47
if we can all about being decent human
beings


245
0:11:36,47 --> 0:11:39,18
the light on for the world as we claim
we are


246
0:11:39,18 --> 0:11:41,0
we should never do this again


247
0:11:41,0 --> 0:11:44,56
colonel still is not an american hero


248
0:11:44,56 --> 0:11:46,58
he does not productive


249
0:11:46,58 --> 0:11:51,39
he is the exact opposite result so would
be seen him in beings would want


250
0:11:51,39 --> 0:11:52,739
these are not some sort of


251
0:11:52,739 --> 0:11:55,25
glorious heroes as they were


252
0:11:55,25 --> 0:11:56,64
review you know


253
0:11:56,64 --> 0:12:0,73
made out to be by the right wing during
the contra scandal by the ricardo still


254
0:12:0,73 --> 0:12:4,19
involved in the contra scandal of course


255
0:12:4,19 --> 0:12:7,61
and they do these hideous things again
and again


256
0:12:7,61 --> 0:12:9,47
and we have to stop them


257
0:12:9,47 --> 0:12:11,579
the fact that god we found out


258
0:12:11,579 --> 0:12:14,47
where they did this time around so that
we might be for people to prevented the


259
0:12:14,47 --> 0:12:15,87
next time around


260
0:12:15,87 --> 0:12:18,64
and how do we find out bradley many


261
0:12:18,64 --> 0:12:20,61
that is of course twice


262
0:12:20,61 --> 0:12:22,83
possibly facing a life sentence


263
0:12:22,83 --> 0:12:24,28
how about the guys who


264
0:12:24,28 --> 0:12:25,59
did the torture


265
0:12:25,59 --> 0:12:27,5
who ran the desk wives


266
0:12:27,5 --> 0:12:30,8
who taught people how to do the torture
in the best clubs


267
0:12:30,8 --> 0:12:32,12
they of course


268
0:12:32,12 --> 0:14:32,12
are free to go
