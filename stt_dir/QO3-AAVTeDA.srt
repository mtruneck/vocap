0:0:1,473 --> 0:0:9,329
[MUSIC PLAYING]


3
0:0:9,329 --> 0:0:13,257
DAVID CHOE: Ass, cash, or grass,
no one rides for free.


4
0:0:13,257 --> 0:0:14,239
Thumbs up.


5
0:0:14,239 --> 0:0:15,466
I'm David Choe, we're
going cross-country.


6
0:0:15,466 --> 0:0:17,37
We're going across America.


7
0:0:17,37 --> 0:0:21,76
We accept all rides for free.


8
0:0:21,76 --> 0:0:24,99
Hopping trains, hitchhiking
on cars, flying on planes.


9
0:0:24,99 --> 0:0:27,92
We're just not gonna pay
for any of them.


10
0:0:27,92 --> 0:0:30,87
Last time I did this was during
the grunge period in


11
0:0:30,87 --> 0:0:32,95
the early '90s, so
it's been awhile.


12
0:0:32,95 --> 0:0:36,725
And I only almost got raped
twice, and so hopefully that


13
0:0:36,725 --> 0:0:37,1
won't happen.


14
0:0:37,1 --> 0:0:39,305
But I was like a lot skinnier
and sexier then.


15
0:0:39,305 --> 0:0:41,78
And you know a lot of sexual
abuse victims, they put on


16
0:0:41,78 --> 0:0:45,5
weight to make themselves feel
unattractive and unsexy, so


17
0:0:45,5 --> 0:0:47,726
hopefully they'll leave
us alone this time.


18
0:0:47,726 --> 0:0:49,92
I'm bringing Harry Kim.


19
0:0:49,92 --> 0:0:51,951
This is my nephew.


20
0:0:51,951 --> 0:0:54,84
We'll see how far two of the
baddest gooks in K-town can


21
0:0:54,84 --> 0:0:58,67
get across this wide America
by any means possible.


22
0:0:58,67 --> 0:1:1,35
HARRY KIM: Right now we're in
the LA train yard, and we're


23
0:1:1,35 --> 0:1:3,702
gonna head east and
just keep going.


24
0:1:3,702 --> 0:1:8,642



25
0:1:8,642 --> 0:1:13,582
DAVID CHOE: All right, we
should investigate which


26
0:1:13,582 --> 0:1:16,7
train's leaving next.


27
0:1:16,7 --> 0:1:19,5
Sometimes, I come back from
train-hopping trips and people


28
0:1:19,5 --> 0:1:20,38
are like, hey did
you bring me a


29
0:1:20,38 --> 0:1:21,43
souvenir, you're on vacation.


30
0:1:21,43 --> 0:1:23,82
It's like, there's no
gift shops, really.


31
0:1:23,82 --> 0:1:28,24
But what is cool is, when you
walk along the tracks, and you


32
0:1:28,24 --> 0:1:31,24
see a piece of crap,
it's not dog crap.


33
0:1:31,24 --> 0:1:32,51
That's human crap.


34
0:1:32,51 --> 0:1:35,31
And a lot of times, it's
over 100 years old.


35
0:1:35,31 --> 0:1:38,525
Still a nice souvenir for
friends and family.


36
0:1:38,525 --> 0:1:41,87
This isn't "CSI" or anything,
but basically what happened


37
0:1:41,87 --> 0:1:44,85
here was, he took a dump here,
and then he wiped his ass on


38
0:1:44,85 --> 0:1:46,76
the wall right there.


39
0:1:46,76 --> 0:1:50,1
And then he used this rock
and this [INAUDIBLE]


40
0:1:50,1 --> 0:1:51,789
is covered in shit.


41
0:1:51,789 --> 0:1:54,284
To wipe his ass.


42
0:1:54,284 --> 0:1:57,777
HARRY KIM: (SINGING) We are
waiting for the train to come.


43
0:1:57,777 --> 0:1:59,773
Waiting for the train to come.


44
0:1:59,773 --> 0:2:2,268
Waiting for the train to come.


45
0:2:2,268 --> 0:2:4,264
Yeah!


46
0:2:4,264 --> 0:2:7,46
DAVID CHOE: We're having a
little of a rough time getting


47
0:2:7,46 --> 0:2:9,9
out of Los Angeles because
they're all heading to San


48
0:2:9,9 --> 0:2:12,2
Diego, and we don't want
to go to Tijuana.


49
0:2:12,2 --> 0:2:13,48
We're here with Chicago.


50
0:2:13,48 --> 0:2:15,992
He was walking his dog
out here earlier.


51
0:2:15,992 --> 0:2:18,202
What's going on with the train
yard situation out here?


52
0:2:18,202 --> 0:2:20,105
CHICAGO: Well, they're
real anal.


53
0:2:20,105 --> 0:2:22,82
You know, it's like the cops,
they're real dickheads,


54
0:2:22,82 --> 0:2:24,17
because they're not real cops.


55
0:2:24,17 --> 0:2:27,306
So they try to do as much
enforcing as they can.


56
0:2:27,306 --> 0:2:29,375
So they'll fine you the
first time $100.


57
0:2:29,375 --> 0:2:31,27
No warning, no nothing.


58
0:2:31,27 --> 0:2:33,471
From out of town, they'll
definitely slap you with a


59
0:2:33,471 --> 0:2:35,43
fine, each.


60
0:2:35,43 --> 0:2:37,46
And the second time,
you go to jail.


61
0:2:37,46 --> 0:2:38,822
DAVID CHOE: OK.


62
0:2:38,822 --> 0:2:41,6
So, if we want to go to Vegas,
we gotta go that way.


63
0:2:41,6 --> 0:2:42,698
CHICAGO: No, you want to
start that way and


64
0:2:42,698 --> 0:2:44,26
then bend up there.


65
0:2:44,26 --> 0:2:46,75
I just came back from
Vegas yesterday.


66
0:2:46,75 --> 0:2:47,316
HARRY KIM (OFFSCREEN):
On the train?


67
0:2:47,316 --> 0:2:48,875
CHICAGO: Yeah, I went to
the Star Trek event.


68
0:2:48,875 --> 0:2:50,25
HARRY KIM (OFFSCREEN):
That's awesome.


69
0:2:50,25 --> 0:2:51,105
CHICAGO: I'm a nerd.


70
0:2:51,105 --> 0:2:52,33
DAVID CHOE: Do you like
Vulcan stuff?


71
0:2:52,33 --> 0:2:53,245
CHICAGO: I love everything.


72
0:2:53,245 --> 0:2:56,62
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Why
do you like Star Trek?


73
0:2:56,62 --> 0:3:0,3
CHICAGO: It's the way we
should be as a society.


74
0:3:0,3 --> 0:3:2,41
There's no money involved,
you know.


75
0:3:2,41 --> 0:3:5,45
You actually do the job that
you were born for.


76
0:3:5,45 --> 0:3:6,61
DAVID CHOE: So how was it?


77
0:3:6,61 --> 0:3:7,215
How was the convention?


78
0:3:7,215 --> 0:3:7,95
CHICAGO: It was great.


79
0:3:7,95 --> 0:3:8,75
Really fucking awesome.


80
0:3:8,75 --> 0:3:12,48
I got laid by this Klingon chick
in full Klingon outfit.


81
0:3:12,48 --> 0:3:16,171
It was like, unbelievable.


82
0:3:16,171 --> 0:3:17,2
Gotta try it.


83
0:3:17,2 --> 0:3:19,56
Klingon sex.


84
0:3:19,56 --> 0:3:21,694
Be careful of the little
towns though.


85
0:3:21,694 --> 0:3:23,642
Because people are
all crazy, man.


86
0:3:23,642 --> 0:3:25,914
[INAUDIBLE] they all know
each other, and they


87
0:3:25,914 --> 0:3:26,564
will fuck you up.


88
0:3:26,564 --> 0:3:28,25
So you gotta be careful.


89
0:3:28,25 --> 0:3:30,947
People will try to hustle you
out of whatever you got.


90
0:3:30,947 --> 0:3:35,83
Don't ever, ever trust someone
on your little adventure.


91
0:3:35,83 --> 0:3:36,78
DAVID CHOE: I got Blackie
Chan right here.


92
0:3:36,78 --> 0:3:39,5
CHICAGO: You got each other, but
you're not always gonna be


93
0:3:39,5 --> 0:3:40,335
there, dude.


94
0:3:40,335 --> 0:3:42,4
I'm telling you.


95
0:3:42,4 --> 0:3:43,48
Be careful, guys.


96
0:3:43,48 --> 0:3:44,625
Safe trip.


97
0:3:44,625 --> 0:3:46,681
If you're out here tonight, man,
I'll hang out with you


98
0:3:46,681 --> 0:3:48,298
guys, you know, until--


99
0:3:48,298 --> 0:3:51,7



100
0:3:51,7 --> 0:3:54,306
DAVID CHOE: We caught and hopped
a freight out here.


101
0:3:54,306 --> 0:3:56,42
It slowed down, so
we jumped on.


102
0:3:56,42 --> 0:4:0,77
It's 2 o'clock in the morning,
and here we are at the Burger


103
0:4:0,77 --> 0:4:3,57
Den in beautiful Yermo,
California.


104
0:4:3,57 --> 0:4:7,39
This is pretty much the halfway
mark between Vegas and


105
0:4:7,39 --> 0:4:8,461
Los Angeles.


106
0:4:8,461 --> 0:4:11,227
Any cops we should
watch out for?


107
0:4:11,227 --> 0:4:12,805
"LITTLE" RICHARD: Just plenty
of snakes, man.


108
0:4:12,805 --> 0:4:15,51
DAVID CHOE: And what about train
hopping around here?


109
0:4:15,51 --> 0:4:17,5
"LITTLE" RICHARD: Just
be careful, man.


110
0:4:17,5 --> 0:4:20,17
I've never done that, so I can't
say how dangerous it is.


111
0:4:20,17 --> 0:4:21,37
DAVID CHOE: But have
you heard anything?


112
0:4:21,37 --> 0:4:23,752
"LITTLE" RICHARD: Yeah, man,
bums are dying and stuff.


113
0:4:23,752 --> 0:4:24,88
DAVID CHOE: Bums are dying.


114
0:4:24,88 --> 0:4:27,36
"LITTLE" RICHARD: Just I don't
know why, but I guess they're


115
0:4:27,36 --> 0:4:28,37
all train jumpers.


116
0:4:28,37 --> 0:4:31,536
Probably they're all drunk and
stuff, but, I don't know.


117
0:4:31,536 --> 0:4:32,77
DAVID CHOE: All right.


118
0:4:32,77 --> 0:4:34,66
Bums are dying.


119
0:4:34,66 --> 0:4:35,41
Be careful.


120
0:4:35,41 --> 0:4:36,56
Watch out for snakes.


121
0:4:36,56 --> 0:4:41,18
You heard it from Richard at
the Burger Den in Yermo.


122
0:4:41,18 --> 0:4:43,25
We're stranded in Yermo
for a little bit.


123
0:4:43,25 --> 0:4:44,96
We've been trying to hitch
a ride out and can't


124
0:4:44,96 --> 0:4:46,425
seem to get a ride.


125
0:4:46,425 --> 0:4:49,915
However, we found this abandoned
hotel that looks


126
0:4:49,915 --> 0:4:54,134
like it's being renovated and
it's nice and warm in here.


127
0:4:54,134 --> 0:4:57,779
And it doesn't look like
anyone's gonna fuck with us,


128
0:4:57,779 --> 0:5:1,667
so I guess this is
home for tonight.


129
0:5:1,667 --> 0:5:5,8



130
0:5:5,8 --> 0:5:8,98
We tried to sleep at the little
construction site hotel


131
0:5:8,98 --> 0:5:11,93
in Yermo and they
kicked us out.


132
0:5:11,93 --> 0:5:15,235
Some highway patrolmen came by
at like 4:00 in the morning.


133
0:5:15,235 --> 0:5:17,22
So we walked a mile out.


134
0:5:17,22 --> 0:5:19,375
I think this place is called
the Calico Ghost Town.


135
0:5:19,375 --> 0:5:22,44
Fucking guy decided to
get sick last night.


136
0:5:22,44 --> 0:5:27,24
I wanna get going, but I just
wanted to leave a mark.


137
0:5:27,24 --> 0:5:29,1
We're trying to catch
a train out.


138
0:5:29,1 --> 0:5:32,23
Hopefully we'll try to make
it to Vegas by today.


139
0:5:32,23 --> 0:5:34,37
But we wanna destroy this
house a little bit.


140
0:5:34,37 --> 0:6:0,758



141
0:6:0,758 --> 0:6:3,81
This is the best seat
in the house.


142
0:6:3,81 --> 0:6:8,196
And we're basically sitting on
a metal conductor for heat,


143
0:6:8,196 --> 0:6:11,138
and my ass is burning
right now.


144
0:6:11,138 --> 0:6:12,59
It's fucking hot.


145
0:6:12,59 --> 0:6:19,366



146
0:6:19,366 --> 0:6:21,79
And that's the clickety clack.


147
0:6:21,79 --> 0:6:24,951
When the force pulls, like all
of them go, [TRAIN NOISES].


148
0:6:24,951 --> 0:6:27,17
And so, we're in Yermo.


149
0:6:27,17 --> 0:6:29,18
We just caught one out to--


150
0:6:29,18 --> 0:6:30,82
we're heading out towards
the beautiful Las Vegas.


151
0:6:30,82 --> 0:6:33,942



152
0:6:33,942 --> 0:6:37,85
I spent probably the last decade
and a half of my life


153
0:6:37,85 --> 0:6:40,46
being the worst thief
on the planet.


154
0:6:40,46 --> 0:6:44,26
I had a huge change of heart
and a change of thinking in


155
0:6:44,26 --> 0:6:45,39
the last few years.


156
0:6:45,39 --> 0:6:47,8
I never thought I'd actually
be a successful artist, but


157
0:6:47,8 --> 0:6:51,16
when I'm selling paintings and
making a decent living out of


158
0:6:51,16 --> 0:6:55,66
it, I got aspects of why I'm
stealing Starburst from 7-11.


159
0:6:55,66 --> 0:6:58,73
So, it's more of a habit that
was very tough to break in.


160
0:6:58,73 --> 0:7:0,91
I guess, an addiction also.


161
0:7:0,91 --> 0:7:3,38
So I fill that void in
my life with Christ.


162
0:7:3,38 --> 0:7:6,56
And so, God is still part of my
life right now, but if I'm


163
0:7:6,56 --> 0:7:10,6
completely honest, not as
big as when I did have


164
0:7:10,6 --> 0:7:12,31
the change of heart.


165
0:7:12,31 --> 0:7:15,34
Slowly, yet surely,
another thing that


166
0:7:15,34 --> 0:7:16,78
filled my life is gambling.


167
0:7:16,78 --> 0:7:19,3
And so gambling is a huge
part of my life now.


168
0:7:19,3 --> 0:7:23,5
So, last time I went to Vegas,
I was delivering custom-made


169
0:7:23,5 --> 0:7:25,71
shorts for a UFC fighter.


170
0:7:25,71 --> 0:7:27,35
It's a long story, but basically
there was like a


171
0:7:27,35 --> 0:7:30,72
dead hooker in front of his
room, and he was frazzled.


172
0:7:30,72 --> 0:7:34,35
My friend gave me some money to
put on a fight, and he lost


173
0:7:34,35 --> 0:7:36,91
money on the fight with the
leftover money that I wasn't


174
0:7:36,91 --> 0:7:37,87
able to put on the fight.


175
0:7:37,87 --> 0:7:39,52
I went to the Venetian
and I went to the


176
0:7:39,52 --> 0:7:39,97
high roller's room.


177
0:7:39,97 --> 0:7:42,9
And I won $40,000.


178
0:7:42,9 --> 0:7:45,43
And so, I guess I'm considered a
high roller and they've been


179
0:7:45,43 --> 0:7:46,69
calling me ever since.


180
0:7:46,69 --> 0:7:48,17
They want their money
back, basically.


181
0:7:48,17 --> 0:7:50,57
So, I figure we're pretty
fucking dirty.


182
0:7:50,57 --> 0:7:51,502
We're pretty tired.


183
0:7:51,502 --> 0:7:55,242
Might as well milk our
opportunities.


184
0:7:55,242 --> 0:7:58,12
Hi, Yvonne, this
is David Choe.


185
0:7:58,12 --> 0:8:0,88
I haven't been back there since
probably a few months


186
0:8:0,88 --> 0:8:4,872
and I was wondering if it's too
late to cash in on one of


187
0:8:4,872 --> 0:8:6,81
those rooms.


188
0:8:6,81 --> 0:8:9,56
Wow, thank you.


189
0:8:9,56 --> 0:8:11,251
Thumbs up.


190
0:8:11,251 --> 0:8:13,65
I guess we're gonna go
from rags to riches.


191
0:8:13,65 --> 0:8:16,355
They got us a pretty nice room
over there at the Venetian for


192
0:8:16,355 --> 0:8:17,88
free because they want
their money back.


193
0:8:17,88 --> 0:8:21,4
Hopefully, I can remain cool
and not become a degenerate


194
0:8:21,4 --> 0:8:22,82
gambler and blow our
entire budget for


195
0:8:22,82 --> 0:8:23,56
the trip in one night.


196
0:8:23,56 --> 0:8:25,95
We barely made it out
of Los Angeles.


197
0:8:25,95 --> 0:8:28,7
Hopefully, we'll make
it out of Sin City.


198
0:8:28,7 --> 0:8:31,42
Our train just stopped
in literally


199
0:8:31,42 --> 0:8:32,94
the middle of nowhere.


200
0:8:32,94 --> 0:8:35,864
Harry's sick and he's
almost out of water.


201
0:8:35,864 --> 0:8:38,669
You know, it's very important
to stay hydrated out here in


202
0:8:38,669 --> 0:8:39,77
the desert.


203
0:8:39,77 --> 0:8:42,309
So if he is to pass out, I
will piss in his mouth.


204
0:8:42,309 --> 0:8:43,824
Keep waking him up.


205
0:8:43,824 --> 0:8:44,68
How you feeling?


206
0:8:44,68 --> 0:8:45,585
HARRY KIM: Keep me hydrated.


207
0:8:45,585 --> 0:8:47,46
DAVID CHOE: Feeling better?


208
0:8:47,46 --> 0:8:48,4
HARRY KIM: Yup, feeling good.


209
0:8:48,4 --> 0:8:49,93
DAVID CHOE: OK.


210
0:8:49,93 --> 0:8:53,26
We just stopped and we saw an
open boxcar when the train was


211
0:8:53,26 --> 0:8:56,14
turning, so that might be
a more enjoyable ride.


212
0:8:56,14 --> 0:8:59,33
It'll be a change of pace.


213
0:8:59,33 --> 0:9:1,56
Complain to the concierge,
get a different room.


214
0:9:1,56 --> 0:9:5,74



215
0:9:5,74 --> 0:9:10,1
It has taken us over
16 hours to get


216
0:9:10,1 --> 0:9:12,59
halfway from LA to Vegas.


217
0:9:12,59 --> 0:9:16,33
We're in a place called Kelso
right now, still about 200


218
0:9:16,33 --> 0:9:19,15
miles from Vegas.


219
0:9:19,15 --> 0:9:23,73
What people don't understand is,
during the 1920s and '30s,


220
0:9:23,73 --> 0:9:25,86
the railroads were built
on the backs


221
0:9:25,86 --> 0:9:27,32
of Chinese and blacks.


222
0:9:27,32 --> 0:9:29,21
This is the spine
of this country.


223
0:9:29,21 --> 0:9:29,94
This is the backbone.


224
0:9:29,94 --> 0:9:31,75
Like everywhere the train went,
that's where little


225
0:9:31,75 --> 0:9:32,48
towns popped up.


226
0:9:32,48 --> 0:9:36,35
You drive cross-country in a
car, you see the 10 freeway.


227
0:9:36,35 --> 0:9:38,36
You go through from
LA to Miami.


228
0:9:38,36 --> 0:9:41,58
You hit all these towns, 7-11s,
Circle K's but, you go


229
0:9:41,58 --> 0:9:42,9
on the train.


230
0:9:42,9 --> 0:9:44,78
You go through some places that
time has not touched in


231
0:9:44,78 --> 0:9:46,44
50, 60, 100 years.


232
0:9:46,44 --> 0:9:48,5
Some backwards towns, some of
the most beautiful amazing


233
0:9:48,5 --> 0:9:49,99
things you've ever seen
in your life.


234
0:9:49,99 --> 0:9:54,17
This is one of the last American
frontiers, I think.


235
0:9:54,17 --> 0:9:56,5
As every year goes by, it gets
more and more harder to do


236
0:9:56,5 --> 0:9:58,106
this kind of traveling,
but it's a


237
0:9:58,106 --> 0:9:59,356
great way to save money.


238
0:9:59,356 --> 0:10:26,584



239
0:10:26,584 --> 0:10:31,41
So here we are, in beautiful
"Lost Wages." We just hopped a


240
0:10:31,41 --> 0:10:33,74
boxcar out here.


241
0:10:33,74 --> 0:10:37,2
I think there's a room waiting
for us at the Venetian, so


242
0:10:37,2 --> 0:10:38,67
time to gamble.


243
0:10:38,67 --> 0:10:51,43



244
0:10:51,43 --> 0:10:53,725
We're in beautiful
Las Vegas again.


245
0:10:53,725 --> 0:10:56,41
We just walked from the
train tracks over to


246
0:10:56,41 --> 0:10:58,386
the Venetian hotel.


247
0:10:58,386 --> 0:11:1,208
I'm gonna get my free room, and
hopefully get a manicure


248
0:11:1,208 --> 0:11:6,154
and pedicure and a free sauna,
and a happy ending and all the


249
0:11:6,154 --> 0:11:6,727
good stuff.


250
0:11:6,727 --> 0:11:7,848
Let's go, Harry.


251
0:11:7,848 --> 0:11:9,98
HARRY KIM: Luxury.


252
0:11:9,98 --> 0:11:21,792



253
0:11:21,792 --> 0:11:23,42
DAVID CHOE: Hi.


254
0:11:23,42 --> 0:11:26,17



255
0:11:26,17 --> 0:11:27,85
Thumbs up.


256
0:11:27,85 --> 0:11:29,85
I justify this behavior
because it is


257
0:11:29,85 --> 0:11:31,34
comped and it's free.


258
0:11:31,34 --> 0:11:33,894
And I worked hard losing
money to get that comp.


259
0:11:33,894 --> 0:11:36,67
And I'm not comped anywhere
else, so this will be it,


260
0:11:36,67 --> 0:11:39,65
before we head off on
the road again.


261
0:11:39,65 --> 0:11:44,3
It's our one hurrah.


262
0:11:44,3 --> 0:12:13,39



263
0:12:13,39 --> 0:12:14,58
Familiar story.


264
0:12:14,58 --> 0:12:15,77
Lost it all.


265
0:12:15,77 --> 0:12:18,62
Took a cash advance out on my
credit card to get back to


266
0:12:18,62 --> 0:12:20,2
even money.


267
0:12:20,2 --> 0:12:22,3
Lost it all.


268
0:12:22,3 --> 0:12:25,64
I am the biggest loser.


269
0:12:25,64 --> 0:12:32,0
I want to sleep till 2007 or
just do a 2-hour drum solo.


270
0:12:32,0 --> 0:12:38,69
[PLAYING DRUMS]


271
0:12:38,69 --> 0:12:39,83
That's how it goes.


272
0:12:39,83 --> 0:12:41,95
One minute, you're up, one
minute you're down.


273
0:12:41,95 --> 0:12:43,85
Down and out in Las Vegas.


274
0:12:43,85 --> 0:12:45,22
I guess fortunes change.


275
0:12:45,22 --> 0:12:48,18
So, the situation is, we found
out this morning that we


276
0:12:48,18 --> 0:12:49,655
weren't comped for
a second room.


277
0:12:49,655 --> 0:12:52,94
My 20 minutes of play doesn't
get me two nights.


278
0:12:52,94 --> 0:12:55,77
Fortunately, I have a friend
from high school that became a


279
0:12:55,77 --> 0:12:59,185
pit boss at the lovely and
beautiful Golden Palm Resort


280
0:12:59,185 --> 0:13:3,7
and Casino, which is pretty much
a dump and pretty much


281
0:13:3,7 --> 0:13:5,83
only known for its
karaoke which is


282
0:13:5,83 --> 0:13:7,192
pretty fucking awesome.


283
0:13:7,192 --> 0:13:18,62



284
0:13:18,62 --> 0:13:21,3
Wow, I don't know what
to say because--


285
0:13:21,3 --> 0:13:24,26
OK, so we come into
karaoke night.


286
0:13:24,26 --> 0:13:27,66
We find Lee, who takes care of
all the odds and ends around


287
0:13:27,66 --> 0:13:29,5
the Golden Palm.


288
0:13:29,5 --> 0:13:33,31
But he's working in a tiny
office, has a samurai sword,


289
0:13:33,31 --> 0:13:36,7
all these video monitor
cameras.


290
0:13:36,7 --> 0:13:39,51
And the guy's also sleeping on
the floor, and unbelievably


291
0:13:39,51 --> 0:13:42,1
does the best Bob Dylan
I've ever heard.


292
0:13:42,1 --> 0:13:43,315
Quite a performer.


293
0:13:43,315 --> 0:13:44,5
What are you doing here?


294
0:13:44,5 --> 0:13:47,21
LEE: I am the hotel
electrician.


295
0:13:47,21 --> 0:13:49,93
I'm the resident musician.


296
0:13:49,93 --> 0:13:51,31
I'm past my third marriage.


297
0:13:51,31 --> 0:13:52,81
My daughter's 24.


298
0:13:52,81 --> 0:13:54,42
She's in the United
States Navy.


299
0:13:54,42 --> 0:13:55,27
DAVID CHOE: Were you
in the Navy?


300
0:13:55,27 --> 0:13:58,23
LEE: Yeah, I'm third
generation Navy.


301
0:13:58,23 --> 0:14:0,5
I am a performer of
petty miracles.


302
0:14:0,5 --> 0:14:5,17
I played bass guitar
since I was 18.


303
0:14:5,17 --> 0:14:8,21
Took two lessons from
Jerry Garcia.


304
0:14:8,21 --> 0:14:9,89
I enjoy the karaoke forays.


305
0:14:9,89 --> 0:14:11,89
DAVID CHOE: Well, tell me
a little bit about the--


306
0:14:11,89 --> 0:14:15,384
I mean, tell me the world of
karaoke, is it a harsh world?


307
0:14:15,384 --> 0:14:17,32
Do people know you in
the karaoke circuit?


308
0:14:17,32 --> 0:14:20,365
LEE: A lot of live musicians
at point


309
0:14:20,365 --> 0:14:21,63
and time in the past--


310
0:14:21,63 --> 0:14:24,82
I had not actually rehearsed
music, taking it into the


311
0:14:24,82 --> 0:14:27,72
band, then the band would say,
well, we don't think you can


312
0:14:27,72 --> 0:14:31,1
really do that song, or we
don't think we can do it.


313
0:14:31,1 --> 0:14:35,74
But with karaoke, the CD disc is
always gonna play the same.


314
0:14:35,74 --> 0:14:37,1
It's always gonna be there.


315
0:14:37,1 --> 0:14:38,52
It's not gonna talk
back to you.


316
0:14:38,52 --> 0:14:40,6
It's never gonna be late.


317
0:14:40,6 --> 0:14:41,39
It don't get drunk.


318
0:14:41,39 --> 0:14:45,88
Only thing you can do is
do it worse, or better.


319
0:14:45,88 --> 0:14:46,81
Make a decision.


320
0:14:46,81 --> 0:14:50,96
I'm never gonna do that
song again, or


321
0:14:50,96 --> 0:14:52,553
yes, that's a keeper.


322
0:14:52,553 --> 0:14:55,331



323
0:14:55,331 --> 0:14:58,67
DAVID CHOE: The one plus side to
the scalding hot weather in


324
0:14:58,67 --> 0:15:1,38
the daytime is actually, at
night time, it's pretty nice


325
0:15:1,38 --> 0:15:1,79
and pleasant.


326
0:15:1,79 --> 0:15:5,772
So Eric, my friend, is letting
us sleep by the pool without


327
0:15:5,772 --> 0:15:6,97
anyone bothering us.


328
0:15:6,97 --> 0:15:10,81
And the security guard is
keeping the hookers away from


329
0:15:10,81 --> 0:15:12,305
pickpocketing us
while we sleep.


330
0:15:12,305 --> 0:15:13,77
It's a nice night out.


331
0:15:13,77 --> 0:15:18,46
We'll wake up and take a bath
in the jacuzzi and hitch out


332
0:15:18,46 --> 0:15:21,71
of Vegas tomorrow and hopefully
get the fuck out of


333
0:15:21,71 --> 0:15:24,645
this town because I've been
here way too long.


334
0:15:24,645 --> 0:15:37,255



335
0:15:37,255 --> 0:15:39,49
DAVID CHOE: I apologize
in advance if I


336
0:15:39,49 --> 0:15:41,31
seem irritable today.


337
0:15:41,31 --> 0:15:43,895
Me and Harry slept by the pool
at the Golden Palm last night,


338
0:15:43,895 --> 0:15:47,73
and was rudely awoken by
the sun in our face.


339
0:15:47,73 --> 0:15:49,15
It's day four.


340
0:15:49,15 --> 0:15:50,88
I wanna get the fuck
out of Vegas.


341
0:15:50,88 --> 0:15:53,59
This is really the city
of Lost Wages.


342
0:15:53,59 --> 0:15:55,995
Our goal today is to at least
make it to Arizona and New


343
0:15:55,995 --> 0:15:57,71
Mexico, if possible.


344
0:15:57,71 --> 0:15:59,18
This place sucks.


345
0:15:59,18 --> 0:16:1,844
We're gonna make ourselves
a sign, right now.


346
0:16:1,844 --> 0:16:5,232
JACK: They're standing out
here with a street sign.


347
0:16:5,232 --> 0:16:7,573
It says, towards Arizona.


348
0:16:7,573 --> 0:16:9,45
These motherfuckers just wanna
get home from work.


349
0:16:9,45 --> 0:16:10,611
It's Friday afternoon.


350
0:16:10,611 --> 0:16:12,329
They wanna get home,
do their drugs, get


351
0:16:12,329 --> 0:16:14,0
fucked, and watch TV.


352
0:16:14,0 --> 0:16:15,44
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): That
sounds like what you wanna do.


353
0:16:15,44 --> 0:16:16,88
JACK: No, I'm honestly
talking.


354
0:16:16,88 --> 0:16:17,6
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, OK.


355
0:16:17,6 --> 0:16:18,89
JACK: I'm out here just
like you are.


356
0:16:18,89 --> 0:16:20,22
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): You
should come with us.


357
0:16:20,22 --> 0:16:22,471
JACK: I gotta job, though.


358
0:16:22,471 --> 0:16:23,764
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): You
don't think anyone's gonna


359
0:16:23,764 --> 0:16:24,195
pick us up?


360
0:16:24,195 --> 0:16:27,7
JACK: I hope you guys get to
where you're going, I do.


361
0:16:27,7 --> 0:16:27,7
I'm pulling for you.


362
0:16:27,7 --> 0:16:30,832
But in reality, no one's
gonna pick you up.


363
0:16:30,832 --> 0:16:31,758
DAVID CHOE: OK.


364
0:16:31,758 --> 0:16:33,8
High-five.


365
0:16:33,8 --> 0:16:35,1



366
0:16:35,1 --> 0:16:36,9
Golden rule is to smile while
you're hitchhiking.


367
0:16:36,9 --> 0:16:39,262
No one likes a sour-puss face.


368
0:16:39,262 --> 0:16:40,526
Just smile.


369
0:16:40,526 --> 0:16:41,776
You'll look like a nice guy.


370
0:16:41,776 --> 0:16:50,315



371
0:16:50,315 --> 0:16:52,79
DAVID CHOE: Harry sweet-talked
the nice lady.


372
0:16:52,79 --> 0:16:55,76
HARRY KIM (OFFSCREEN): Yes.


373
0:16:55,76 --> 0:16:58,148
DAVID CHOE: Gracias.


374
0:16:58,148 --> 0:17:0,593
This is our first ride.


375
0:17:0,593 --> 0:17:2,549
Thumbs up, America.


376
0:17:2,549 --> 0:17:3,799
HARRY KIM (OFFSCREEN):
We did it.


377
0:17:3,799 --> 0:17:10,862



378
0:17:10,862 --> 0:17:12,119
MALE SPEAKER: What's up, man.


379
0:17:12,119 --> 0:17:12,842
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN):
All right.


380
0:17:12,842 --> 0:17:14,65
Thanks for giving us a ride.


381
0:17:14,65 --> 0:17:15,73
We appreciate it.


382
0:17:15,73 --> 0:17:16,84
Were you scared?


383
0:17:16,84 --> 0:17:18,4
FEMALE SPEAKER: No.


384
0:17:18,4 --> 0:17:19,4
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): OK.


385
0:17:19,4 --> 0:17:20,778
Only when the police came?


386
0:17:20,778 --> 0:17:24,2
Thank you so much.


387
0:17:24,2 --> 0:17:27,89
One thing I forgot about fear
and hitchhiking is, when


388
0:17:27,89 --> 0:17:31,23
you're hitchhiking, and you talk
to the people, and you


389
0:17:31,23 --> 0:17:33,71
say, hey, how about a lift, and
they're in the lane to get


390
0:17:33,71 --> 0:17:36,71
on the freeway, and you know,
they say obvious lies like,


391
0:17:36,71 --> 0:17:38,78
oh, I'm not getting on the
freeway, I'm going straight.


392
0:17:38,78 --> 0:17:40,65
And it's obvious that you're
not going straight.


393
0:17:40,65 --> 0:17:42,95
It's weird because you start
to build this hatred and


394
0:17:42,95 --> 0:17:44,81
resentment towards people, and
you're like, why are you


395
0:17:44,81 --> 0:17:45,26
lying, man?


396
0:17:45,26 --> 0:17:46,34
Why the fuck are you
lying to me.


397
0:17:46,34 --> 0:17:47,82
It's obvious you're getting
on the freeway.


398
0:17:47,82 --> 0:17:49,0
You just don't wanna
give me a ride.


399
0:17:49,0 --> 0:17:51,23
Like, hey man, just be real,
just be honest with me.


400
0:17:51,23 --> 0:17:53,91
But then, what would their
honest reasons be?


401
0:17:53,91 --> 0:17:56,78
And in life, when are people
really honest with you anyway?


402
0:17:56,78 --> 0:17:58,54
Oh no, I don't want to give you
a ride because you smell


403
0:17:58,54 --> 0:18:0,3
and you're dirty and
you're chinky.


404
0:18:0,3 --> 0:18:2,355
And then you think about it for
yourself if it was with


405
0:18:2,355 --> 0:18:3,72
the reverse situation.


406
0:18:3,72 --> 0:18:5,57
If I'm honest with myself, I
don't want to pick them up


407
0:18:5,57 --> 0:18:8,4
because they're dirty, and they
sweat, and I don't want


408
0:18:8,4 --> 0:18:9,305
them in my car.


409
0:18:9,305 --> 0:18:11,81
But, who wants to say that?


410
0:18:11,81 --> 0:18:16,607
So, I have no one to be angry
at with except for myself.


411
0:18:16,607 --> 0:18:17,857
And Harry.


412
0:18:17,857 --> 0:18:27,37



413
0:18:27,37 --> 0:18:29,38
She's going our direction
but I have no idea.


414
0:18:29,38 --> 0:18:30,61
Do you have your flashlight,
Harry?


415
0:18:30,61 --> 0:18:32,4
HARRY KIM (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, shit, dude.


416
0:18:32,4 --> 0:18:33,45
DAVID CHOE: OK, so basically,
we just got a


417
0:18:33,45 --> 0:18:35,79
ride from a nice lady.


418
0:18:35,79 --> 0:18:39,24
And it's a van, it's a little
bit hot in the back.


419
0:18:39,24 --> 0:18:41,206
We're heading east.


420
0:18:41,206 --> 0:18:44,48
We don't know which--


421
0:18:44,48 --> 0:18:47,38
this is sort of scary,
actually.


422
0:18:47,38 --> 0:18:49,86
I'm never gotten a ride
in a van that's like--


423
0:18:49,86 --> 0:18:51,22
HARRY KIM (OFFSCREEN):
No windows.


424
0:18:51,22 --> 0:18:55,62
DAVID CHOE: But it did say "God
Bless America." And there


425
0:18:55,62 --> 0:19:0,526
was only like, two scary guys
that are sitting in the back,


426
0:19:0,526 --> 0:19:1,93
so I think we're all good.


427
0:19:1,93 --> 0:19:3,1
HARRY KIM (OFFSCREEN):
So, that's our


428
0:19:3,1 --> 0:19:4,27
way out right there.


429
0:19:4,27 --> 0:19:8,408
There's no way we can find out
where we are or anything


430
0:19:8,408 --> 0:19:8,654
that's outside.


431
0:19:8,654 --> 0:19:11,6
The windows are black and all
the lights are taken out.


432
0:19:11,6 --> 0:19:15,54
DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): What
do you think this is?


433
0:19:15,54 --> 0:19:16,78
Feels like an arm.


434
0:19:16,78 --> 0:19:18,28
Dude, someone's arm.


435
0:19:18,28 --> 0:19:24,28



436
0:19:24,28 --> 0:19:25,53
Oh, phew.


437
0:19:25,53 --> 0:19:29,75



438
0:19:29,75 --> 0:19:31,66
HARRY KIM (OFFSCREEN): That's
the last person's clothes.


439
0:19:31,66 --> 0:19:33,91
The last person who
got picked up.


440
0:19:33,91 --> 0:19:34,895
They just left that here.


441
0:19:34,895 --> 0:19:36,92
DAVID CHOE: If this is the last
you ever hear from me,


442
0:19:36,92 --> 0:19:40,76
mom and dad, I love
you very much.


443
0:19:40,76 --> 0:19:44,99
And I tried my best to be
the best son I could.


444
0:19:44,99 --> 0:19:46,7
To my girlfriend, Milan,
I love you very much.


445
0:19:46,7 --> 0:19:51,4
I'm sorry I was like the
worst boyfriend ever.


446
0:19:51,4 --> 0:19:52,29
Can you guys hear me?


447
0:19:52,29 --> 0:21:52,29
