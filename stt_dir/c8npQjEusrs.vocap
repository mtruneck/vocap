###7 Ok this is Athena Jezik and we're going to.. we're on the floor.
###10 working and we're going to work...
###15 we're going to work the back from the floor.
###21 Kind of brushing her off right now. Just
###24 starting showing you some other things to do.
###27 Just kind of get the contact going.
###31 and of course when they're working the back we're going to need to apply the oil.
###36 So, we're going to start by
###39 putting some oil on.
###47 Here on the back you want enough oil to
###52 be able to have a nice
###55 slide
###56 to your hands,
###59 but not too much
###61 you still want enough..
###63 enough mobility to work the muscle.
###67 And if you get too much of a slipperiness to it it's hard to maintain
###72 that part of it
###73 We're gonna go all the way down to the
###78 to the hip
###80 area here where there's
###83 muscle attachments that come down from the top and from the bottom up.
###88 This is quite a place of stability through here.
###95 It's been a
###97 few weeks since I've
###99 worked her back so i can feel that there's been some
###104 i guess from sitting room whatever it is that she does carry there's a little
###108 bit of tension
###109 coming up through the back.
###112 Now, because of it being positioned on the floor things change
###115 a little bit with the routine.
###118 So, normally I start at the head with myself being at the head, but instead I'm just
###122 gonna start
###123 up in this area and
###125 take my fingers on either side of the vertebrae
###128 and work down.
###134 Ok, that way you could see where I am on here,
###138 which is right next to the vertebrae
###142 working it downward...
###144 I'm doing two right close in
###147 and i'll tell you when you do this you can feel
###150 a lot of what's going on
###151 down in the spine.
###154 We're not taking a whole lot of pressure just enough pressure to where the
###157 muscle is letting you in and not enough
###159 pressure to where it's pushing
###161 back at you.
###163 Then you move a little farther away from the spine
###168 and sometimes you'll see
###171 it's not a straight line.
###174 You have to go with where the tissue is. Always follow the anatomy
###178 and then down
###180 on the edge
###184 there's a lot of different structures that come into play so just
###188 keep on the focus
###190 when working the erector spinae.
###195 Ok, and then you can work it back up
###207 ... the neck is turned
###209 so you can't really
###212 get a real good straight shot at that
###215 but if you're working a person from the floor you can get that neck when you're doing neck
###219 unwinding.
###221 You might want to wait until the end to do
###224 that part, have them turn over last.
###228 And okay, now we're just going to start in with this
###232 shoulder area.
###237 And if you're on the floor it's a little bit trickier.
###242 I'm gonna put one leg up...
###247 get a little bit better leverage.
###250 I'm leaning against my knee here.
###257 And here what I'm going along is the trapezius muscle. Just
###263 one little band at a time.
###272 And moving down, now the scapula,
###275 which is the shoulder blade
###277 is right here.
###280 Here's the scapula.
###282 So you're gonna hit a bony surface, so
###284 i'd just work up to that surface and
###287 take it right to the edge
###289 similar to
###292 how i did the clavicle.
###294 You're right on the edge of it, a little bit underneath... and following this
###301 down the trapezius muscle coming to a point
###304 down here.
###310 Okay now starting at the point of the trapezius muscle,
###314 trapezius is
###317 somewhat of a "V" shape and then
###320 up like a trapeze.
###325 And then
###326 pushing inward kind of
###328 stroking his toward the
###331 vertebrae
###332 and there's a little bit of a circular motion, not much.
###359 Now, here I'm going along the
###362 scapula. Let me see if I can get a better sort of vision for you.
###368 Here's the scapula
###369 right here
###370 you can go underneath it by picking up the shoulder slightly
###376 working underneath it.
###377 If you feel a little snapping thing
###380 or crunchy kind of feelings
###383 that's been referred to as crepitus.
###386 I don't know if people really know what crepitus is...
###389 It feels to me like it's just a really tight tight area that's not getting a
###394 lot of fluid in it.
###397 And I have
###398 been able to see crepitus change.
###404 and then i'm going to be a flat on the scapula.
###411 And just working the muscle
###414 the weight of the muscle school you can feel there kind of an upward
###418 and they curve into the
###420 arm socket.
###422 so it's really about
###424 knowing the anatomy and just following the anatomy
###428 and then knowing the pressure not to be too
###432 deep with the pressure and then along the side here
###440 getting along side the scapula here... the scapula is here. Coming down you're working right up
###444 up
###446 alongside of it and kind of up under
###449 under it a little bit which can be
###451 lifted under here
###453 as well.
###456 Where there is a little bit of a scapula pick up here
###459 it's mostly
###460 muscle through here.
###462 Sometimes this is very ticklish
###464 for people, so
###466 you can usually get through
###468 tickling..
###469 ticklishness
###471 if you go slowly into it.
###474 And just work with it. Eventually, it won't have that tickly response.
###479 Now, working all the way down
###482 we're going to be doing upward
###484 movements
###485 along the hip.
###489 Thumb, one right after the other.
###491 It's moving ever so slightly
###494 until you're all the way to the edge.
###498 Running your thumbs down
###502 and then you can
###503 go up the vertebrae
###508 on one side.
###512 And again you can't get all the way to the head so just take it as far as you can.
###515 Lighten it up and kind of touch that area of the head.
###520 And then we're going to do the
###522 middle part of the
###524 long muscle,
###528 the erector spinae.
###533 It's the muscle that holds the spine up
###536 in an upright position.
###539 It holds the spine erect.
###541 It does need abdominal muscles to support it properly
###545 which is why core exercising is important.
###550 That's another reason why movement is so important
###553 and the free flow movement from what i have done is
###559 much more beneficial than
###561 rigid movement because sometimes you can unwind yourself
###565 going through
###567 more of a free type of movement than
###570 something that's
###571 in a straight line,
###573 than the more linear type of movement. Now
###581 I'm doing a cross fiber friction up the
###584 erector muscle and
###590 kinda getting underneath it. You kind of slip your finger underneath it and
###594 kind of stretch it to the side, kind of pull it aside. It feels real good to have that done.
###607 And up we go.
###614 Okay and then
###617 you can go to the other side
###625 ...
###629 So, now on the second side I'm gonna just repeat it. I'm gonna go a little quicker at
###633 this.
###635 This stretching down. Remember we stretch down
###639 and I start at the vertebrae.
###644 Kind of follow the.. now here's the scapula.
###648 Let's show you the scapula again
###651 where we are.
###655 There is the scapula.
###658 right here it comes down to a little point.
###660 It actually lifted up quite a bit.
###664 And that's the scapula, so that's...
###667 Now, you can get under it and shake it. I didn't really do much of that
###670 on the other side, but
###672 if you have your one hand underneath
###675 and you're right on the shoulder
###676 uh... not the socket, but above the shoulder toward more mid-line of the shoulder and just
###682 rock it back and forth while you let your other hand slide up underneath
###687 in the sub-scapularis area
###689 you.. it's a very nice feeling to loosen up the scapulas that way.
###693 So that's.. I didn't show much on that side, but I'll show more on this side and of course you can
###697 apply it on both sides.
###699 And then of course getting the muscles on top of the scapula
###703 working them a little bit more.
###706 You can work a little more petrissage, where you are
###709 really moving that around
###712 giving a little more range of motion to
###715 uh... the muscles.
###721 They don't really have range of motion but
###723 they can move a little more on there when they are relaxed they can have a little more movement.
###730 Okay
###731 So then we can take it and bring
###733 ourselves back up through the
###739 trapezius muscle and this muscle is really.. on this side it's  much
###744 much tighter
###745 than the other side and i know that's because of
###750 different things that Corrina does
###754 with her arms and posture so if
###757 you are right dominant
###759 the muscular feeling
###762 much more work that the right side of her body takes on
###765 so the muscles are a little
###767 more developed as well as a little bit tighter
###770 you're never going to find true complete symmetry in
###774 most people. You might find it in one or two but usually people do have a
###779 lack of symmetry somewhere in the body.
###784 It's not a problem as long as it's not too
###787 out of balance.
###789 You do want to try to keep both sides of your body
###794 as balanced as possible.
###798 And then we are done with the hip again. Working that.
###805 That's an important part to feel. Sometimes you will feel little bumpies
###808 in there
###810 and just be gentle when you go over them and work on them
###814 don't put too much pressure. Don't try to beat them out just
###818 work them
###819 slowly,
###821 on winding them,
###824 spreading them
###827 kind of thing
###828 and then we just work up the back
###834 and up again.
###837 This is the same thing going up
###840 the muscle is a
###841 strap of muscle so you just want to go to three different
###844 places on that muscle and another little
###856 thing you can do.. I'm not doing the exact same thing on each side. I'm getting some different
###859 ideas.
###861 It's very different working from the floor
###864 than it is
###865 from the table.
###867 So, things change quite a bit.
###869 But you still do want to keep some kind of
###872 symmetry of what you're doing so you're covering the same things.
###876 In this video I'm just demonstrating different things that you can do from the floor
###881 and working that up again through the
###884 vertebrae.
###887 And then you can come back down the vertebrae.
###890 umm...
###893 with your fingers on each side
###895 and doing a little
###897 vertebral
###899 vibration
###900 which is very very nice.
###904 Takes a little
###905 practice though for the therapist to do
###908 or the person working, so
###912 how I started was I would just put the other hand on top
###915 fingers on either side and just
###917 rock it back and forth
###919 to start with and then when you get
###921 really you can also vibrate it down like this but that's a little
###925 harder
###928 to do. It takes a little bit more practice.
###931 That's a very nice one as well
###934 and then something that's real nice to end with
###937 is if you just place the palm of your hand
###940 across the spine and very slowly. You first...
###944 you just interface with it, so you feel like there is this interfacing
###948 and you will feel a bit of energy between your hand
###951 and the vertebrae if you're not pushing
###953 too hard
###954 so if your on them
###956 even if your light just lighten it more, lighten it more
###960 lighten it more
###961 so that you're
###963 feeling as if there's just a little tiny
###967 paper-thin
###969 area that you're touching the body with
###971 and then very slowly move
###974 the hand up.
###976 Now this
###977 really turns out to be a little more energetic
###980 but oftentimes I feel
###984 people's muscles relaxing out from under my hands when I go real slowly
###988 at this
###989 there's something about this particular thing that relaxes the muscles in a way
###994 that i feel a tremendous amount of work
###997 coming out of a lot of
###999 backs
###1000 as they're
###1001 relaxing more
###1002 just like coming up
###1004 this uh... spine
###1006 very lightly
###1008 and more of an energetic kind of
###1010 move.
###1012 And you just take that all the way up
###1016 very slowly
###1020 And you can do this once or twice, I usually try to do things in threes and
###1031 then at the neck you''ll just
###1033 take your thumb around and
###1035 just complete it out, now because the neck is turned sideways
###1038 and because of the nature of this being more energetic I'm
###1041 flattening the palm
###1044 and just completing it more energetically
###1047 up through the base of the skull
###1049 and then letting it come off.
###1051 And then you can go up just regular.
###1054 But that's a very very very nice
###1057 thing to do and then you can just wrap
###1060 the body
###1062 and we'll wrap it from this side and then pulling it down
###1067 stretching it that way.
###1069 Okay
###1071 there we have it.
###1073 A few more ideas for you if you are working from the floor. Thank you so much this is
###1077 Athena Jezik.
