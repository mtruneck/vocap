0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,97
STEVE SPANGLER: Well,
it's 1952.


2
0:0:2,97 --> 0:0:5,4
I'm just kind of carving
a pumpkin--


3
0:0:5,4 --> 0:0:6,2
Whoops, oh!


4
0:0:6,2 --> 0:0:7,77
Oh--


5
0:0:7,77 --> 0:0:10,45
oh, oh, oopsie.


6
0:0:10,45 --> 0:0:13,2
I kind of cut myself
a little bit.


7
0:0:13,2 --> 0:0:15,95
Little Higgins, get over
here little Higgins.


8
0:0:15,95 --> 0:0:19,51
Use that rotary dial on
the phone and call--


9
0:0:19,51 --> 0:0:20,75
call Aunt Mabel.


10
0:0:20,75 --> 0:0:22,97
She'll get us connected
with the sheriff.


11
0:0:22,97 --> 0:0:24,73
And, uh, maybe you could
put the pressure


12
0:0:24,73 --> 0:0:28,3
and stop the bleeding.


13
0:0:28,3 --> 0:0:31,0
Alright, it's 2012.


14
0:0:31,0 --> 0:0:33,2
It is awesome.


15
0:0:33,2 --> 0:0:33,82
Fake blood--


16
0:0:33,82 --> 0:0:35,9
that's what we're talking
about today.


17
0:0:35,9 --> 0:0:37,87
The best fake blood ever.


18
0:0:37,87 --> 0:0:38,79
[MUSIC PLAYING]


19
0:0:38,79 --> 0:0:41,93
I'm Steve Spangler and I'm all
about making science fun.


20
0:0:41,93 --> 0:0:44,57
For the last twenty years I've
been teaching ways to turn


21
0:0:44,57 --> 0:0:47,59
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


22
0:0:47,59 --> 0:0:48,62
experiences.


23
0:0:48,62 --> 0:0:51,24
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


24
0:0:51,24 --> 0:0:53,73
affect the way people
think about science.


25
0:0:53,73 --> 0:0:57,68
And to do that, I live by one
motto-- make it big, do it


26
0:0:57,68 --> 0:0:59,25
right, give it class.


27
0:0:59,25 --> 0:1:5,4



28
0:1:5,4 --> 0:1:7,82
Well, you know the best thing
about this blood--


29
0:1:7,82 --> 0:1:10,1
totally edible because
it's chocolate syrup.


30
0:1:10,1 --> 0:1:12,3
Back in the '40s and '50s in
movies and television, they


31
0:1:12,3 --> 0:1:15,135
just used chocolate syrup
to make fake blood.


32
0:1:15,135 --> 0:1:18,9
It was easy to clean up and
because of the black and white


33
0:1:18,9 --> 0:1:19,53
nobody even cared.


34
0:1:19,53 --> 0:1:21,28
Well, today's day and age you've
got to be a little bit


35
0:1:21,28 --> 0:1:22,75
more sophisticated about that.


36
0:1:22,75 --> 0:1:25,55
So this episode is all about
the best ways to be able to


37
0:1:25,55 --> 0:1:28,42
make the best fake blood.


38
0:1:28,42 --> 0:1:30,0
Well, fake blood has come
a long way since


39
0:1:30,0 --> 0:1:31,65
the 1940's and '50s.


40
0:1:31,65 --> 0:1:33,962
In fact, I have a vested
interest in this whole kind of


41
0:1:33,962 --> 0:1:35,58
fake blood business.


42
0:1:35,58 --> 0:1:38,3
If you saw our episode in the
Spangler Effect where I


43
0:1:38,3 --> 0:1:41,46
introduce you to my parents, you
know that my mom and dad


44
0:1:41,46 --> 0:1:44,2
were responsible for making a
lot of fake blood back in the


45
0:1:44,2 --> 0:1:47,5
late '50s and early '60s that
ultimately has been used for


46
0:1:47,5 --> 0:1:48,54
the last four or five decades.


47
0:1:48,54 --> 0:1:50,76
Dad even had this trick called
You Do Voodoo and here's one


48
0:1:50,76 --> 0:1:52,55
of the original ones.


49
0:1:52,55 --> 0:1:54,71
This is a trick were you put a
needle through your arm-- it


50
0:1:54,71 --> 0:1:55,4
didn't really--


51
0:1:55,4 --> 0:1:57,44
I don't really put your needle
through the arm, but-- but it


52
0:1:57,44 --> 0:1:58,31
looks so good.


53
0:1:58,31 --> 0:2:1,65
And part of the secret was this
blood that he invented.


54
0:2:1,65 --> 0:2:5,52
The technology was a whole lot
more complicated than just a


55
0:2:5,52 --> 0:2:8,9
syrup and something-- a little
red food coloring.


56
0:2:8,9 --> 0:2:13,92
This particular blood here was
perfectly matched to human


57
0:2:13,92 --> 0:2:19,37
blood, had a flow of regular
blood, and under all kinds of


58
0:2:19,37 --> 0:2:20,69
lights it was acceptable.


59
0:2:20,69 --> 0:2:22,78
See, under fluorescent light and
under incandescent light


60
0:2:22,78 --> 0:2:24,2
things look a little
bit different.


61
0:2:24,2 --> 0:2:26,74
The most important part about
this blood is there's a


62
0:2:26,74 --> 0:2:29,5
special micro-encapsulation
to it, so that if


63
0:2:29,5 --> 0:2:30,47
it got in your clothes--


64
0:2:30,47 --> 0:2:32,5
that it wouldn't stain
your clothes.


65
0:2:32,5 --> 0:2:33,78
You literally could
wash it right off.


66
0:2:33,78 --> 0:2:36,28
Unlike the blood that was the
syrup, there's no way to eat


67
0:2:36,28 --> 0:2:37,81
this because it's not something
that's supposed to


68
0:2:37,81 --> 0:2:38,61
be in your mouth.


69
0:2:38,61 --> 0:2:40,26
This blood-- extremely
expensive.


70
0:2:40,26 --> 0:2:43,3
It doesn't clog small little
tubes that the Muppets would


71
0:2:43,3 --> 0:2:46,75
use, for example, and some of
they're little puppets.


72
0:2:46,75 --> 0:2:49,69
You can kind of see that this is
the extreme way to go with


73
0:2:49,69 --> 0:2:50,35
fake blood.


74
0:2:50,35 --> 0:2:51,18
Cool stuff.


75
0:2:51,18 --> 0:2:53,87
But today how about just going
to the kitchen and we're just


76
0:2:53,87 --> 0:2:56,55
going to use materials that
you'll find in your normal


77
0:2:56,55 --> 0:2:59,59
pantry and be able to formulate
a fake blood that's


78
0:2:59,59 --> 0:3:2,5
perfect for whatever application
you need.


79
0:3:2,5 --> 0:3:3,75
Looks good though.


80
0:3:3,75 --> 0:3:6,57



81
0:3:6,57 --> 0:3:8,96
All right, so on to classic,
fake blood.


82
0:3:8,96 --> 0:3:11,78
Now, a couple weeks ago you can
either be a mixologist--


83
0:3:11,78 --> 0:3:13,28
a little bit of this, and a
little bit of that, or if


84
0:3:13,28 --> 0:3:15,88
you'd like to follow the recipe
we put a link for you


85
0:3:15,88 --> 0:3:18,94
in the description for this
particular video.


86
0:3:18,94 --> 0:3:20,19
Start with water.


87
0:3:20,19 --> 0:3:24,44



88
0:3:24,44 --> 0:3:25,16
You don't need too much.


89
0:3:25,16 --> 0:3:29,92
So here's the water and a small
amount of food coloring.


90
0:3:29,92 --> 0:3:34,29
Believe it not, that is
the basic recipe.


91
0:3:34,29 --> 0:3:36,45
The problem is you're going to
go through all of that food


92
0:3:36,45 --> 0:3:38,19
coloring and there are
a couple problems.


93
0:3:38,19 --> 0:3:41,87
First of all, it doesn't
look like blood.


94
0:3:41,87 --> 0:3:44,44
It looks a little bit more like
syrup, because it's not


95
0:3:44,44 --> 0:3:45,5
thick enough.


96
0:3:45,5 --> 0:3:48,42
So it's too red, but it's
definitely not thick enough.


97
0:3:48,42 --> 0:3:51,22
And the test is always on
that white handkerchief.


98
0:3:51,22 --> 0:3:52,97
So if you take a look
at it like that--


99
0:3:52,97 --> 0:3:53,85
See this?


100
0:3:53,85 --> 0:3:54,47
Not thick enough.


101
0:3:54,47 --> 0:3:58,71
So to that, you typically add a
small amount of Karo syrup.


102
0:3:58,71 --> 0:4:1,58
So the goal is to make sure that
our blood is edible just


103
0:4:1,58 --> 0:4:3,42
in case you kind of get it
on your face or whatever.


104
0:4:3,42 --> 0:4:5,44
So the Karo syrup does
nothing but help


105
0:4:5,44 --> 0:4:7,2
thicken it a little bit.


106
0:4:7,2 --> 0:4:9,45
And that seemed to be
just about enough.


107
0:4:9,45 --> 0:4:12,8
As you mix it around here--


108
0:4:12,8 --> 0:4:14,96
this definitely gives it a
little bit more thickness, but


109
0:4:14,96 --> 0:4:16,519
you can see how orange
it looks.


110
0:4:16,519 --> 0:4:19,92
So for passing it as fake blood
it's not fantastic.


111
0:4:19,92 --> 0:4:22,65
But believe it or not, if you
go to the Halloween store a


112
0:4:22,65 --> 0:4:24,71
lot of the fake blood that
you're going to find looks


113
0:4:24,71 --> 0:4:26,21
something like this.


114
0:4:26,21 --> 0:4:27,57
The test for us--


115
0:4:27,57 --> 0:4:28,44
the napkin test.


116
0:4:28,44 --> 0:4:31,28
So we'll put this out
here like this.


117
0:4:31,28 --> 0:4:33,23
Put it on here and
see how it looks.


118
0:4:33,23 --> 0:4:34,48
Watch.


119
0:4:34,48 --> 0:4:38,3



120
0:4:38,3 --> 0:4:38,345
All right.


121
0:4:38,345 --> 0:4:42,84
I think it's easy to say this
does not look like fake blood.


122
0:4:42,84 --> 0:4:45,32
It looks like orange Kool-aid.


123
0:4:45,32 --> 0:4:46,92
Not going to pass the test.


124
0:4:46,92 --> 0:4:48,6
Here's where the science
comes in.


125
0:4:48,6 --> 0:4:50,9
As we look at this, this is a
little too transparent, right?


126
0:4:50,9 --> 0:4:52,31
I'd really like to have
something that is a little bit


127
0:4:52,31 --> 0:4:53,28
more translucent.


128
0:4:53,28 --> 0:4:54,41
Transparent's like water.


129
0:4:54,41 --> 0:4:56,32
I can actually see images
through this.


130
0:4:56,32 --> 0:4:58,55
I really don't want to be able
to see through it and I want


131
0:4:58,55 --> 0:4:59,1
to darken it.


132
0:4:59,1 --> 0:5:1,82
So a couple ways to be able to
do that-- we can go back to


133
0:5:1,82 --> 0:5:3,72
our favorite Hershey's
syrup, right?


134
0:5:3,72 --> 0:5:6,85
So this chocolate syrup down
inside will help darken it


135
0:5:6,85 --> 0:5:7,33
just a little bit.


136
0:5:7,33 --> 0:5:9,6
But you try it in some
small portions.


137
0:5:9,6 --> 0:5:11,78
Watch.


138
0:5:11,78 --> 0:5:12,99
That's about what we need.


139
0:5:12,99 --> 0:5:15,83
And now you mix it up.


140
0:5:15,83 --> 0:5:18,87
Again, it's starting to take
on a little bit more of a


141
0:5:18,87 --> 0:5:20,13
translucent quality.


142
0:5:20,13 --> 0:5:23,91
You see kind of that
chocolateness that you get.


143
0:5:23,91 --> 0:5:27,5
It's definitely not there with
our fake blood just yet.


144
0:5:27,5 --> 0:5:30,36
It has a little bit-- we'd need
a little bit more of the


145
0:5:30,36 --> 0:5:31,27
red food coloring.


146
0:5:31,27 --> 0:5:33,56
Here, let's take a look
at this and see


147
0:5:33,56 --> 0:5:33,6
what this looks like.


148
0:5:33,6 --> 0:5:36,14
Watch.


149
0:5:36,14 --> 0:5:39,18
No, see it's just
not there yet.


150
0:5:39,18 --> 0:5:40,71
A little too orange--


151
0:5:40,71 --> 0:5:42,31
a little darker than this.


152
0:5:42,31 --> 0:5:45,22
But maybe the chocolate syrup
isn't the answer.


153
0:5:45,22 --> 0:5:47,3
So as we're experimenting,
you just want to see what


154
0:5:47,3 --> 0:5:49,56
ingredients you can add and
what effect it has so that


155
0:5:49,56 --> 0:5:51,37
when you make your batch
you know which way to


156
0:5:51,37 --> 0:5:52,21
kind of push it.


157
0:5:52,21 --> 0:5:55,39
So instead of using just the
chocolate syrup, try this--


158
0:5:55,39 --> 0:5:57,5
this is cocoa powder.


159
0:5:57,5 --> 0:6:1,41
So a small amount of the power
here inside will give it a


160
0:6:1,41 --> 0:6:2,7
little darker quality.


161
0:6:2,7 --> 0:6:3,99
Watch.


162
0:6:3,99 --> 0:6:7,28
Again, I'm going to use about
a kind of a heavy teaspoon.


163
0:6:7,28 --> 0:6:8,77
That goes in here.


164
0:6:8,77 --> 0:6:11,89
Just mix it up and
see what we get.


165
0:6:11,89 --> 0:6:13,49
A little hard to blend it
because you've got little


166
0:6:13,49 --> 0:6:16,1
pieces in there and so you're
going to want to


167
0:6:16,1 --> 0:6:17,58
get this mixed up.


168
0:6:17,58 --> 0:6:20,19
But once it's there you can see
that it has a little bit


169
0:6:20,19 --> 0:6:21,34
different quality to it.


170
0:6:21,34 --> 0:6:24,57
So when it's on this
piece here--


171
0:6:24,57 --> 0:6:27,12
it's losing some of the redness
that we had before.


172
0:6:27,12 --> 0:6:29,36
So I think what we're going to
need to do is go back with a


173
0:6:29,36 --> 0:6:30,805
little bit more food coloring.


174
0:6:30,805 --> 0:6:32,3
I think we're on
our way though.


175
0:6:32,3 --> 0:6:35,25
That's it for this batch,
let's start fresh.


176
0:6:35,25 --> 0:6:36,89
Well, now that we know the
basics you can start looking


177
0:6:36,89 --> 0:6:38,7
for some better products.


178
0:6:38,7 --> 0:6:40,34
So instead of just food
coloring, you'll walk down the


179
0:6:40,34 --> 0:6:42,54
aisles and you're just looking
for things-- this, for


180
0:6:42,54 --> 0:6:45,13
example, is dessert topper--


181
0:6:45,13 --> 0:6:49,37
cherry dessert topper made
by my friend, Dr Pepper.


182
0:6:49,37 --> 0:6:51,26
A refreshing drink.


183
0:6:51,26 --> 0:6:54,32
So a little bit of
this in here is--


184
0:6:54,32 --> 0:6:57,33
is kind of blood-like
in and of itself.


185
0:6:57,33 --> 0:6:59,13
Look.


186
0:6:59,13 --> 0:7:1,79
Notice we've taken care of a
couple considerations here.


187
0:7:1,79 --> 0:7:5,17
You have the thickness of that
Karo syrup, you have kind of


188
0:7:5,17 --> 0:7:6,68
the coloring that's there--


189
0:7:6,68 --> 0:7:8,19
so that's not bad at all.


190
0:7:8,19 --> 0:7:10,51
It definitely is too thick, so
it's going to need a little


191
0:7:10,51 --> 0:7:11,56
bit of water.


192
0:7:11,56 --> 0:7:15,21
So we add a little bit
of water to it here.


193
0:7:15,21 --> 0:7:16,12
Good.


194
0:7:16,12 --> 0:7:17,82
And we know that it needs
a little bit of


195
0:7:17,82 --> 0:7:19,39
food coloring as well--


196
0:7:19,39 --> 0:7:20,99
just a little bit.


197
0:7:20,99 --> 0:7:23,92
And mix it up and see
what we've got.


198
0:7:23,92 --> 0:7:25,59
This is already looking good.


199
0:7:25,59 --> 0:7:27,42
All right, look at this.


200
0:7:27,42 --> 0:7:31,44
It doesn't have that candy-like
consistency that we


201
0:7:31,44 --> 0:7:32,77
saw before.


202
0:7:32,77 --> 0:7:35,52
And we found out that if we add
a small amount of cocoa,


203
0:7:35,52 --> 0:7:40,38
that really kind of helps it not
become transparent but a


204
0:7:40,38 --> 0:7:41,74
little bit more translucent.


205
0:7:41,74 --> 0:7:42,81
So just--


206
0:7:42,81 --> 0:7:45,17
this goes here.


207
0:7:45,17 --> 0:7:48,48
Again, it's just mixing
and kind of guessing.


208
0:7:48,48 --> 0:7:50,48
I found that the powder
seems to be a secret.


209
0:7:50,48 --> 0:7:52,46
It really has a good
consistency.


210
0:7:52,46 --> 0:7:55,42
And when it sits for just a
little while the blood seems


211
0:7:55,42 --> 0:7:56,94
to be a lot better.


212
0:7:56,94 --> 0:7:59,445
Right now it just looks
like dessert.


213
0:7:59,445 --> 0:8:2,83
But a little mixing and it
should look pretty good.


214
0:8:2,83 --> 0:8:5,1
I think we need to shift it on
the blue side a little bit.


215
0:8:5,1 --> 0:8:8,69
So again, a drop of the
blue food coloring.


216
0:8:8,69 --> 0:8:10,98
That's looking pretty good.


217
0:8:10,98 --> 0:8:12,85
Mix it up.


218
0:8:12,85 --> 0:8:14,69
Here's one of the problems--
with all food coloring that


219
0:8:14,69 --> 0:8:17,96
we're using and the syrups and
everything else, unlike the


220
0:8:17,96 --> 0:8:20,36
really expensive fake blood,
this stuffs going to stain.


221
0:8:20,36 --> 0:8:23,55
So you have to realize that
Halloween will be fun, but on


222
0:8:23,55 --> 0:8:27,47
November 1 you're going to look
a little weird because


223
0:8:27,47 --> 0:8:28,92
it's going to stain
you a little bit.


224
0:8:28,92 --> 0:8:30,45
But it's not bad.


225
0:8:30,45 --> 0:8:30,99
Here, watch this.


226
0:8:30,99 --> 0:8:32,64
Let's see how good this is.


227
0:8:32,64 --> 0:8:33,89
Watch.


228
0:8:33,89 --> 0:8:37,669



229
0:8:37,669 --> 0:8:39,24
I can shift it definitely
a little bit


230
0:8:39,24 --> 0:8:40,89
more to that red side.


231
0:8:40,89 --> 0:8:43,69
And I think that's looking
pretty good.


232
0:8:43,69 --> 0:8:46,39
It's just experimenting and
playing with a little bit.


233
0:8:46,39 --> 0:8:48,21
And there is one more secret.


234
0:8:48,21 --> 0:8:52,68
Because the thickening agent,
which is the Karo syrup,


235
0:8:52,68 --> 0:8:55,24
doesn't add any color to it--
and so maybe we change the


236
0:8:55,24 --> 0:8:58,56
thickening agent-- and that's
where cornstarch comes in.


237
0:8:58,56 --> 0:8:59,98
Well, it's blender time.


238
0:8:59,98 --> 0:9:1,26
So grab the blender.


239
0:9:1,26 --> 0:9:3,6
And I found a different
kind of corn syrup.


240
0:9:3,6 --> 0:9:4,72
Take a look at this.


241
0:9:4,72 --> 0:9:7,495
This corn syrup is actually
brown, so it kind of helps us


242
0:9:7,495 --> 0:9:8,54
with the color immediately.


243
0:9:8,54 --> 0:9:10,32
So it's adding some of
the color and some


244
0:9:10,32 --> 0:9:11,9
thickness as well.


245
0:9:11,9 --> 0:9:14,546
So let's start with
cornstarch.


246
0:9:14,546 --> 0:9:16,63
And how much, you ask?


247
0:9:16,63 --> 0:9:20,26
Exactly that much.


248
0:9:20,26 --> 0:9:22,3
I don't know.


249
0:9:22,3 --> 0:9:23,31
Just experiment.


250
0:9:23,31 --> 0:9:25,41
To that we're going to add some
of the food coloring.


251
0:9:25,41 --> 0:9:27,67
So here's our food
coloring, here.


252
0:9:27,67 --> 0:9:30,48
That's part of our concentrate
so we use quite a bit of that.


253
0:9:30,48 --> 0:9:32,93
So that's looking good.


254
0:9:32,93 --> 0:9:36,8
I think a small amount of that
cherry topping seems to work


255
0:9:36,8 --> 0:9:41,34
fairly well especially since
it's brown and thick.


256
0:9:41,34 --> 0:9:42,11
That's looking good.


257
0:9:42,11 --> 0:9:44,63
There was a fair amount
of water in the


258
0:9:44,63 --> 0:9:45,9
other mixture there.


259
0:9:45,9 --> 0:9:47,24
They had the food coloring.


260
0:9:47,24 --> 0:9:49,61
And now it's ready to blend.


261
0:9:49,61 --> 0:9:51,28
Get your hand on the top
otherwise you're going to be


262
0:9:51,28 --> 0:9:52,53
painting the ceiling.


263
0:9:52,53 --> 0:9:55,103



264
0:9:55,103 --> 0:9:58,54
Now as you see it
blending here--


265
0:9:58,54 --> 0:10:1,28
looking pretty red but
that-- it's not bad.


266
0:10:1,28 --> 0:10:2,765
In fact, that's looking
really good.


267
0:10:2,765 --> 0:10:6,24



268
0:10:6,24 --> 0:10:8,16
This is like liquid diabetes.


269
0:10:8,16 --> 0:10:9,51
Don't drink it.


270
0:10:9,51 --> 0:10:11,98
I'm going to save a small amount
out because this is


271
0:10:11,98 --> 0:10:13,47
pretty good.


272
0:10:13,47 --> 0:10:16,17
You know as I look at it,
it's a little too red,


273
0:10:16,17 --> 0:10:17,97
but it's not bad.


274
0:10:17,97 --> 0:10:19,2
It's not bad at all.


275
0:10:19,2 --> 0:10:22,71
The thing that we're going to
add here is cornstarch.


276
0:10:22,71 --> 0:10:25,43
Now cornstarch, of course, is
white and when it mixes in


277
0:10:25,43 --> 0:10:27,1
there it's going to thicken
it just a little bit.


278
0:10:27,1 --> 0:10:29,28
But that white is going to tone
this down and make it so


279
0:10:29,28 --> 0:10:32,93
it's not as transparent.


280
0:10:32,93 --> 0:10:34,82
So how much, you ask?


281
0:10:34,82 --> 0:10:35,95
Who cares.


282
0:10:35,95 --> 0:10:41,74
Just put some in, blend it
up, and see how it looks.


283
0:10:41,74 --> 0:10:43,86
Lid on top, holding tight,
take a look at this.


284
0:10:43,86 --> 0:10:48,189



285
0:10:48,189 --> 0:10:52,37
Now it's not going to
thicken it too much.


286
0:10:52,37 --> 0:10:55,92
Oh, look at the splattering
here.


287
0:10:55,92 --> 0:10:58,81
So you can see the secret to all
of this is the cornstarch,


288
0:10:58,81 --> 0:11:1,38
because look-- it doesn't look
nearly as transparent as it


289
0:11:1,38 --> 0:11:3,4
did before.


290
0:11:3,4 --> 0:11:5,44
This is perfect.


291
0:11:5,44 --> 0:11:6,64
All right, take a
look at this.


292
0:11:6,64 --> 0:11:8,36
Just a small amount here.


293
0:11:8,36 --> 0:11:13,32
And now on to the handkerchief
Oh, this is really, really


294
0:11:13,32 --> 0:11:15,47
looking good.


295
0:11:15,47 --> 0:11:16,66
Man, that's fantastic.


296
0:11:16,66 --> 0:11:18,83
So a small amount of cornstarch
really kind of


297
0:11:18,83 --> 0:11:20,34
helps it on the sides here.


298
0:11:20,34 --> 0:11:22,23
But I think we can darken
it just a tiny little


299
0:11:22,23 --> 0:11:25,77
bit using the cocoa.


300
0:11:25,77 --> 0:11:27,66
The key here is just
small amounts.


301
0:11:27,66 --> 0:11:29,93
So you don't want
to use a ton.


302
0:11:29,93 --> 0:11:33,14
But for this big batch
here, this much is


303
0:11:33,14 --> 0:11:34,1
going to be just fine.


304
0:11:34,1 --> 0:11:36,92
So I'm going put this in, grind
it, take a look at it,


305
0:11:36,92 --> 0:11:40,18
see if it's good, then you
can adjust it from there.


306
0:11:40,18 --> 0:11:42,3
And if anybody asks you what
you're doing in the kitchen


307
0:11:42,3 --> 0:11:44,62
you just simply say, I'm
making fake blood.


308
0:11:44,62 --> 0:11:47,29
Or if your neighbors come over
you should cover yourself with


309
0:11:47,29 --> 0:11:50,2
it and say, oh, I
had an accident!


310
0:11:50,2 --> 0:11:51,47
But then somebody's going
to call the police.


311
0:11:51,47 --> 0:11:52,72
Just turn on the blender.


312
0:11:52,72 --> 0:11:55,22



313
0:11:55,22 --> 0:11:57,182
All right, look at this.


314
0:11:57,182 --> 0:11:58,383
Looking even better.


315
0:11:58,383 --> 0:11:59,56
See?


316
0:11:59,56 --> 0:12:0,36
Looking better.


317
0:12:0,36 --> 0:12:1,75
See this darkness
that's in there?


318
0:12:1,75 --> 0:12:6,39
And that's exactly what that
powdered cocoa did for us.


319
0:12:6,39 --> 0:12:7,52
So that was perfect.


320
0:12:7,52 --> 0:12:10,62
This is looking even better.


321
0:12:10,62 --> 0:12:11,75
This looks great.


322
0:12:11,75 --> 0:12:14,23
So here-- just a small amount
here like this.


323
0:12:14,23 --> 0:12:15,38
It's nice and dark.


324
0:12:15,38 --> 0:12:16,63
Take a look at this.


325
0:12:16,63 --> 0:12:18,71



326
0:12:18,71 --> 0:12:19,95
You know what?


327
0:12:19,95 --> 0:12:21,25
I like it.


328
0:12:21,25 --> 0:12:21,85
I like it a lot.


329
0:12:21,85 --> 0:12:23,2
We really don't have
a reference


330
0:12:23,2 --> 0:12:24,21
point with real blood.


331
0:12:24,21 --> 0:12:26,55
You can see where we started
here-- a little too orange.


332
0:12:26,55 --> 0:12:28,46
And then moved to this area here
that looks like it's a


333
0:12:28,46 --> 0:12:30,3
little bit more candy-like.


334
0:12:30,3 --> 0:12:33,98
And finally, this is starting
to get into the real deal.


335
0:12:33,98 --> 0:12:36,886
I think it's looking
pretty good.


336
0:12:36,886 --> 0:12:39,5
Oh, it does not taste great,
but it's not the


337
0:12:39,5 --> 0:12:40,49
object to eat it.


338
0:12:40,49 --> 0:12:42,7
It's to gross people out.


339
0:12:42,7 --> 0:12:44,76
I'm going to add just a small
amount of cornstarch.


340
0:12:44,76 --> 0:12:46,57
The last little piece because
I want it sticking to the


341
0:12:46,57 --> 0:12:49,57
walls, toning it down just
a little tiny bit.


342
0:12:49,57 --> 0:12:51,89
Again, this much looks
pretty good.


343
0:12:51,89 --> 0:12:54,52



344
0:12:54,52 --> 0:12:56,87
Let's see if this makes the
perfect blood for us.


345
0:12:56,87 --> 0:12:59,726



346
0:12:59,726 --> 0:13:1,867
[BLENDING]


347
0:13:1,867 --> 0:13:4,681
All right, this is
looking good.


348
0:13:4,681 --> 0:13:7,698
It's nice and dark, sticking
to the walls here.


349
0:13:7,698 --> 0:13:12,9



350
0:13:12,9 --> 0:13:13,6
I think that could freak
somebody out.


351
0:13:13,6 --> 0:13:17,628
If that's what they saw, this
would freak them out.


352
0:13:17,628 --> 0:13:19,54
Uh, it looks good too.


353
0:13:19,54 --> 0:13:20,97
It's perfect.


354
0:13:20,97 --> 0:13:23,58
All right, let's see what
our little blood


355
0:13:23,58 --> 0:13:25,34
recipe looks like.


356
0:13:25,34 --> 0:13:27,586
Nice.


357
0:13:27,586 --> 0:13:29,77
All right, well I don't have
real blood to compare it to,


358
0:13:29,77 --> 0:13:33,9
but I can tell you that this
blood here looks a lot better


359
0:13:33,9 --> 0:13:36,3
than what we started with
at the very beginning.


360
0:13:36,3 --> 0:13:38,69
It took a little bit of tweaking
and playing with a


361
0:13:38,69 --> 0:13:40,36
little bit, but I think
it's great.


362
0:13:40,36 --> 0:13:44,46
And blood on a spoon doesn't
look fantastic, but blood in a


363
0:13:44,46 --> 0:13:47,335
syringe would be perfect.


364
0:13:47,335 --> 0:13:48,62
All right, here we go.


365
0:13:48,62 --> 0:13:51,44
A little syringe.


366
0:13:51,44 --> 0:13:52,92
This is perfect.


367
0:13:52,92 --> 0:13:56,93
All right, so now let's put this
out on to the napkin and


368
0:13:56,93 --> 0:13:59,86
see what this looks like.


369
0:13:59,86 --> 0:14:1,615
All right, and now let's
spread it out and


370
0:14:1,615 --> 0:14:4,57
see what this is.


371
0:14:4,57 --> 0:14:6,756
Oh, this--


372
0:14:6,756 --> 0:14:8,51
that's fantastic.


373
0:14:8,51 --> 0:14:10,51
Look at this.


374
0:14:10,51 --> 0:14:12,62
That looks fantastic.


375
0:14:12,62 --> 0:14:17,192
I think we have the blood that
we need to doctor up


376
0:14:17,192 --> 0:14:18,43
Higginsworth.


377
0:14:18,43 --> 0:14:20,145
Higginsworth!


378
0:14:20,145 --> 0:14:22,66
Oh, this looks so good.


379
0:14:22,66 --> 0:14:24,36
The little bit of mixing
in the syringe.


380
0:14:24,36 --> 0:14:26,11
Higgins, come here.


381
0:14:26,11 --> 0:14:27,23
Here's little Higginsworth.


382
0:14:27,23 --> 0:14:27,95
Look at you.


383
0:14:27,95 --> 0:14:30,23
See, I told you this would
look perfect on you.


384
0:14:30,23 --> 0:14:30,44
All right.


385
0:14:30,44 --> 0:14:30,99
BRYAN HIGGINSWORTH: Yeah.


386
0:14:30,99 --> 0:14:31,84
STEVE SPANGLER: And it's
very stylish, too.


387
0:14:31,84 --> 0:14:32,78
All right, so here's what
we're going to do.


388
0:14:32,78 --> 0:14:34,79
I'm going to cover you with this
and then we're going to


389
0:14:34,79 --> 0:14:37,23
walk around the office
and freak people out.


390
0:14:37,23 --> 0:14:38,195
BRYAN HIGGINSWORTH: Nobody's
going to care if


391
0:14:38,195 --> 0:14:39,3
I'm covered in blood.


392
0:14:39,3 --> 0:14:39,63
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes they are.


393
0:14:39,63 --> 0:14:40,65
Are you kidding?


394
0:14:40,65 --> 0:14:41,87
BRYAN HIGGINSWORTH: No, you
could put me in the middle of


395
0:14:41,87 --> 0:14:43,78
the office on the ground covered
in blood, no one's


396
0:14:43,78 --> 0:14:44,42
going to notice.


397
0:14:44,42 --> 0:14:44,87
STEVE SPANGLER: That's a lie.


398
0:14:44,87 --> 0:14:46,1
I am swear--


399
0:14:46,1 --> 0:14:48,12
we need to get like a hammer
came out of your head or


400
0:14:48,12 --> 0:14:48,71
something like that.


401
