2
0:0:0,11 --> 0:0:0,86
JACOB SOBOROFF: Hey, it's Jacob.


3
0:0:0,86 --> 0:0:2,124
Today we've got nude Clooney--


4
0:0:2,124 --> 0:0:4,29
NUDE CLOONEY: I'm always
naked in women's fantasies!


5
0:0:4,29 --> 0:0:14,589
JACOB SOBOROFF: A fish go kart,
and 1,500 feet of sheer terror.


6
0:0:14,589 --> 0:0:16,63
One of the best rock
climbers in the entire world


7
0:0:16,63 --> 0:0:18,54
just did something that
is so terrifying you


8
0:0:18,54 --> 0:0:20,13
have to see it to believe.


9
0:0:20,13 --> 0:0:23,376
This is Alex Honnold free
climbing a 1,500 foot rock


10
0:0:23,376 --> 0:0:24,0
wall in Mexico.


11
0:0:24,0 --> 0:0:25,37
That means by himself.


12
0:0:25,37 --> 0:0:26,53
No safety gear.


13
0:0:26,53 --> 0:0:34,11
And it's already got
over 4,000 years.


14
0:0:34,11 --> 0:0:37,3
Nobody has ever climbed this
wall in this way ever before.


15
0:0:37,3 --> 0:0:38,53
Alex holds a bunch
of speed records,


16
0:0:38,53 --> 0:0:40,363
including one for the
Yosemite Triple Crown.


17
0:0:40,363 --> 0:0:42,25
That is three famously
difficult climbs


18
0:0:42,25 --> 0:0:43,88
and he did them
in under 19 hours.


19
0:0:43,88 --> 0:0:46,495



20
0:0:46,495 --> 0:0:48,87
If that didn't stop your heart,
we got a playlist for you


21
0:0:48,87 --> 0:0:50,742
right after the show
they just might.


22
0:0:50,742 --> 0:0:53,2
LIZZIE: Want to know why Gravity
is up for 10 Academy Award


23
0:0:53,2 --> 0:0:55,17
nominations but don't
have 90 minutes to spare?


24
0:0:55,17 --> 0:0:56,37
Here's a 60 second version.


25
0:0:56,37 --> 0:0:58,78
Israeli animator Leigh Lahav
just released this entry


26
0:0:58,78 --> 0:1:1,93
for Jameson's annual Done
in 60 Seconds competition.


27
0:1:1,93 --> 0:1:3,426
CARTOON GEORGE CLOONEY: Have
I told you about the time--


28
0:1:3,426 --> 0:1:4,716
CARTOON SANDRA BULLOCK: Oh my
god, oh my god, oh my god, oh


29
0:1:4,716 --> 0:1:5,216
my god!


30
0:1:5,216 --> 0:1:5,716
How did you?


31
0:1:5,716 --> 0:1:7,466
CARTOON GEORGE CLOONEY:
It doesn't matter.


32
0:1:7,466 --> 0:1:9,931
What matters now is that
we always stick together.


33
0:1:9,931 --> 0:1:10,43
Always!


34
0:1:10,43 --> 0:1:11,45
CARTOON SANDRA
BULLOCK: My movie!


35
0:1:11,45 --> 0:1:12,95
CARTOON GEORGE
CLOONEY: You bitch!


36
0:1:12,95 --> 0:1:14,741
LIZZIE: Lee's been
posting for nine months,


37
0:1:14,741 --> 0:1:17,19
and she's already won the
hearts of nearly 80,000 people,


38
0:1:17,19 --> 0:1:18,159
myself included.


39
0:1:18,159 --> 0:1:19,7
JACOB SOBOROFF: What
would a car look


40
0:1:19,7 --> 0:1:21,53
like if it was built
for a goldfish?


41
0:1:21,53 --> 0:1:22,986
You don't have to
wonder anymore.


42
0:1:22,986 --> 0:1:24,86
This is all over the
science blogs right now.


43
0:1:24,86 --> 0:1:27,255
A camera uses image
recognition software


44
0:1:27,255 --> 0:1:28,82
and it allows the fish to steer.


45
0:1:28,82 --> 0:1:34,464



46
0:1:34,464 --> 0:1:36,63
We've playlisted more
unnecessary robotic inventions


47
0:1:36,63 --> 0:1:39,524
for you after the show, and
they're all completely awesome.


48
0:1:39,524 --> 0:1:40,94
EARNEST: I'll never
forget the day


49
0:1:40,94 --> 0:1:42,27
that I saw my first DeLorean.


50
0:1:42,27 --> 0:1:43,21
Norman, Oklahoma.


51
0:1:43,21 --> 0:1:44,359
The year 2003.


52
0:1:44,359 --> 0:1:45,9
RegularCar reviews
is know for giving


53
0:1:45,9 --> 0:1:47,524
straightforward
critiques of everything


54
0:1:47,524 --> 0:1:48,69
from Saturns to Subarus.


55
0:1:48,69 --> 0:1:51,28
This time he gets to check
out everyone's dream car.


56
0:1:51,28 --> 0:1:52,738
REGULARCARS GUYS:
We're not worthy!


57
0:1:52,738 --> 0:1:54,93
We're not worthy!


58
0:1:54,93 --> 0:1:57,76
This is the first Delorean
I've ever touched,


59
0:1:57,76 --> 0:1:59,42
and I'm still driving it.


60
0:1:59,42 --> 0:2:0,467
Uh!


61
0:2:0,467 --> 0:2:2,8
EARNEST: You can find more
great reviews on his channel,


62
0:2:2,8 --> 0:2:4,8
including a particularly
illuminating look


63
0:2:4,8 --> 0:2:7,831
at the legendary
1991 Nissan Stanza.


64
0:2:7,831 --> 0:2:10,39
JACOB SOBOROFF: Two days to
Valentine's Day, and love


65
0:2:10,39 --> 0:2:10,659
is in the air.


66
0:2:10,659 --> 0:2:12,2
It is time for some
video love notes,


67
0:2:12,2 --> 0:2:14,43
or what we like to
call YouTube Crush.


68
0:2:14,43 --> 0:2:15,471
MC: It's a YouTube Crush!


69
0:2:15,471 --> 0:2:16,54
Kick the bass!


70
0:2:16,54 --> 0:2:17,3
Ha!


71
0:2:17,3 --> 0:2:20,82
ALI: My biggest YouTube crush
is Amy Poehler's Smart Girls.


72
0:2:20,82 --> 0:2:23,0
It's a celebration of
extraordinary individuals


73
0:2:23,0 --> 0:2:25,274
who are changing the
world by being themselves.


74
0:2:25,274 --> 0:2:26,19
AMY POEHLER: Feminism.


75
0:2:26,19 --> 0:2:27,24
You know what it is, right?


76
0:2:27,24 --> 0:2:27,74
GIRL: Yep.


77
0:2:27,74 --> 0:2:31,112
I think boys and girls
are of equal value.


78
0:2:31,112 --> 0:2:34,74
That means that if a boy
can do the monkey rings,


79
0:2:34,74 --> 0:2:35,385
so can a girl.


80
0:2:35,385 --> 0:2:37,79
ALI: They have a few web
series including Ask Amy, where


81
0:2:37,79 --> 0:2:41,23
Amy Poehler herself gives
really wonderful advice.


82
0:2:41,23 --> 0:2:43,48
AMY POEHLER: Opening your
heart, and being courageous,


83
0:2:43,48 --> 0:2:45,896
and telling people you care
about them or like them-- that


84
0:2:45,896 --> 0:2:47,73
only attracts more
love in your life.


85
0:2:47,73 --> 0:2:49,68
ALI: Amy, will you
be my Valentine?


86
0:2:49,68 --> 0:2:50,95
MC: YouTube crush!


87
0:2:50,95 --> 0:2:51,45
Ha!


88
0:2:51,45 --> 0:2:52,5
JACOB SOBOROFF: We'll be
rolling out some more video love


89
0:2:52,5 --> 0:2:54,0

90
0:2:54,0 --> 0:2:55,1

be a part of it.


91
0:2:55,1 --> 0:2:57,55
Make a video of yourself telling

92
0:2:57,55 --> 0:2:59,55

93
0:2:59,55 --> 0:3:1,31
MC: Because you have
a YouTube crush!


94
0:3:1,31 --> 0:3:2,25
JACOB SOBOROFF: You guys
have been sending us


95
0:3:2,25 --> 0:3:3,19
so many great videos.


96
0:3:3,19 --> 0:3:4,63
Here's one from our
friend Paul Dateh.


97
0:3:4,63 --> 0:3:5,35
PAUL DATEH: If you
were lucky enough


98
0:3:5,35 --> 0:3:7,891
to download Flappy Bird from
the app store before was pulled,


99
0:3:7,891 --> 0:3:11,0
you may very well be obsessed
with this simple yet addicting


100
0:3:11,0 --> 0:3:11,5
game.


101
0:3:11,5 --> 0:3:13,55
Luckily your friend over
at Dumb Stupid videos


102
0:3:13,55 --> 0:3:15,6
has the best strategy
for beating it outright.


103
0:3:15,6 --> 0:3:18,432



104
0:3:18,432 --> 0:3:19,47
See, right there?


105
0:3:19,47 --> 0:3:22,24



106
0:3:22,24 --> 0:3:24,52
JACOB SOBOROFF: One, two.


107
0:3:24,52 --> 0:3:25,8
Ah!


108
0:3:25,8 --> 0:3:25,87
Even though you
can't get it anymore,


109
0:3:25,87 --> 0:3:27,589
Flappy Bird mania
is in full effect.


110
0:3:27,589 --> 0:3:29,88
That video got over 10 million
views in one week alone.


111
0:3:29,88 --> 0:3:31,9
Until tomorrow, links are below.
