1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:11,454



2
0:0:11,454 --> 0:0:13,55
STEVE LUDWIN: I'm going to show
you the effects of the


3
0:0:13,55 --> 0:0:17,6
hemotoxin in venom
on blood, OK?


4
0:0:17,6 --> 0:0:20,161



5
0:0:20,161 --> 0:0:23,67
And you can already see pretty
quickly, it's kind of


6
0:0:23,67 --> 0:0:24,94
congealing.


7
0:0:24,94 --> 0:0:27,22
It's quite gloopy.


8
0:0:27,22 --> 0:0:29,83
And I'm beginning to wonder if
that's such a good thing to be


9
0:0:29,83 --> 0:0:30,82
happening in my body.


10
0:0:30,82 --> 0:0:36,18
Sometimes I think, god,
that can't be good.


11
0:0:36,18 --> 0:0:37,67
I don't have a medical
background.


12
0:0:37,67 --> 0:0:41,11
I have no fucking idea what
it's doing to my body.


13
0:0:41,11 --> 0:0:44,54
If I did die due to snake venom
or whatever, I'm sure


14
0:0:44,54 --> 0:0:46,54
it'll be quite funny
to a lot of people.


15
0:0:46,54 --> 0:0:47,455
And they'll go, you see?


16
0:0:47,455 --> 0:0:48,65
You see?


17
0:0:48,65 --> 0:0:51,6
And even to myself, as I was
floating out of my body and


18
0:0:51,6 --> 0:0:54,505
looking down below, I'm sure
I'd be laughing my ass off.


19
0:0:54,505 --> 0:0:56,0
Like, you idiot.


20
0:0:56,0 --> 0:0:58,91
You're not supposed to inject
snake venom, you fool.


21
0:0:58,91 --> 0:1:20,67



22
0:1:20,67 --> 0:1:25,4
My name is Steve Ludwin, and
I've been self-immunizing with


23
0:1:25,4 --> 0:1:29,79
various snake venoms for
well over 20 years now.


24
0:1:29,79 --> 0:1:30,84
I'm kind of embarrassed.


25
0:1:30,84 --> 0:1:33,45
I mean, I don't know have
that medical background.


26
0:1:33,45 --> 0:1:34,61
I don't even have a proper


27
0:1:34,61 --> 0:1:37,53
American high school education.


28
0:1:37,53 --> 0:1:41,135
There's been quite a few doctors
and scientists that


29
0:1:41,135 --> 0:1:44,75
have been horrified by my lack
of having things that are


30
0:1:44,75 --> 0:1:46,31
sterile and stuff like that.


31
0:1:46,31 --> 0:1:49,81



32
0:1:49,81 --> 0:1:52,445
We have our Lower Baja
rattlesnake.


33
0:1:52,445 --> 0:1:58,181



34
0:1:58,181 --> 0:1:59,143
And bang.


35
0:1:59,143 --> 0:2:1,59
You see that?


36
0:2:1,59 --> 0:2:5,55
That's one unhappy
rattle snake.


37
0:2:5,55 --> 0:2:6,305
Relax.


38
0:2:6,305 --> 0:2:10,47



39
0:2:10,47 --> 0:2:11,9
I've always been
in good health.


40
0:2:11,9 --> 0:2:14,73
I haven't had something
like the flu in


41
0:2:14,73 --> 0:2:16,89
coming up on nine winters.


42
0:2:16,89 --> 0:2:19,24
And as I've gotten older,
people have started to


43
0:2:19,24 --> 0:2:22,49
comment, oh wow, you don't seem
like you're 46 years old.


44
0:2:22,49 --> 0:2:25,68
I had some doctors do tests on
my skin, and they were all


45
0:2:25,68 --> 0:2:28,301
kind of a little bit baffled.


46
0:2:28,301 --> 0:2:29,255
All right, buddy.


47
0:2:29,255 --> 0:2:30,21
Up.


48
0:2:30,21 --> 0:2:34,3
This girl doesn't really
like it very much.


49
0:2:34,3 --> 0:2:37,32
This is why I'm always nervous
holding a viper because they


50
0:2:37,32 --> 0:2:39,83
can spin their fangs around and
actually go through their


51
0:2:39,83 --> 0:2:43,31
lip to get your fingers.


52
0:2:43,31 --> 0:2:44,91
This snake is not wanting
to be milked.


53
0:2:44,91 --> 0:2:46,16
Sometimes that happens.


54
0:2:46,16 --> 0:2:50,41



55
0:2:50,41 --> 0:2:53,11
I had quite an unusual
sort of upbringing.


56
0:2:53,11 --> 0:2:55,55
I'm the son of a Pan Am pilot.


57
0:2:55,55 --> 0:2:58,0
I had a real "Catch Me
If You Can" Leonardo


58
0:2:58,0 --> 0:3:0,37
DiCaprio sort of lifestyle.


59
0:3:0,37 --> 0:3:1,75
I had a credit card.


60
0:3:1,75 --> 0:3:5,1
It just said Pan Am on it with
my name, Steve Ludwin, and I


61
0:3:5,1 --> 0:3:6,97
could get on any plane,
as long as I was


62
0:3:6,97 --> 0:3:10,39
wearing a tie, for free.


63
0:3:10,39 --> 0:3:13,81
My father took me down to the
Miami Serpetarium, when I was


64
0:3:13,81 --> 0:3:18,1
about nine years old, and I got
to meet this now famous


65
0:3:18,1 --> 0:3:20,31
herpetologist called
Bill Haast.


66
0:3:20,31 --> 0:3:24,45
He was the first westerner to
start injecting himself with


67
0:3:24,45 --> 0:3:24,99
snake venom.


68
0:3:24,99 --> 0:3:27,46
He started in 1948.


69
0:3:27,46 --> 0:3:29,44
I was very young and
impressionable.


70
0:3:29,44 --> 0:3:30,79
I loved snakes.


71
0:3:30,79 --> 0:3:33,19
From that moment on after
meeting him, I was like wow,


72
0:3:33,19 --> 0:3:35,1
you can become immune
to snake venom?


73
0:3:35,1 --> 0:3:36,11
This is crazy.


74
0:3:36,11 --> 0:3:37,4
That's called vaccinology.


75
0:3:37,4 --> 0:3:41,69
It's the oldest form of
medicine apparently.


76
0:3:41,69 --> 0:3:45,42
When I was about 17, I was like,
I've got to get that


77
0:3:45,42 --> 0:3:48,75
venom into me somehow.


78
0:3:48,75 --> 0:3:54,89
This is called a Pope's tree
viper, and I'm a little bit


79
0:3:54,89 --> 0:3:55,43
wary of them.


80
0:3:55,43 --> 0:3:57,253
But it's a beautiful snake.


81
0:3:57,253 --> 0:3:58,89
Don't know if you can
see those fangs.


82
0:3:58,89 --> 0:4:0,7
Do you see that fang?


83
0:4:0,7 --> 0:4:3,44
It's a hemotoxin and it's going
to cause massive tissue


84
0:4:3,44 --> 0:4:4,93
destruction.


85
0:4:4,93 --> 0:4:8,49
People have died from these
snakes, so you do not want


86
0:4:8,49 --> 0:4:11,3
that on your finger.


87
0:4:11,3 --> 0:4:16,25
I moved to London in 1987, and I
started working in East End.


88
0:4:16,25 --> 0:4:17,68
It was called The Vivarium.


89
0:4:17,68 --> 0:4:22,16
And basically my job for 1 pound
60 an hour was to unpack


90
0:4:22,16 --> 0:4:27,17
cobras and scorpions and
tarantulas and reptiles for


91
0:4:27,17 --> 0:4:28,42
zoos and laboratories.


92
0:4:28,42 --> 0:4:32,312



93
0:4:32,312 --> 0:4:34,99
See you later.


94
0:4:34,99 --> 0:4:37,82
I started bringing the
venomous snakes home.


95
0:4:37,82 --> 0:4:40,67
My first time doing
it was crazy.


96
0:4:40,67 --> 0:4:43,93
I had never even milked a snake
before, and I just kind


97
0:4:43,93 --> 0:4:45,5
of had to figure it
out on my own.


98
0:4:45,5 --> 0:4:49,15
So what I would do is I would
take a scalpel and scratch


99
0:4:49,15 --> 0:4:51,94
like two little scratch
marks into my arm.


100
0:4:51,94 --> 0:4:54,92
I would take a little bit of the
venom, and I would drop it


101
0:4:54,92 --> 0:4:55,67
into the cut.


102
0:4:55,67 --> 0:4:57,1
And you could feel it
the first time.


103
0:4:57,1 --> 0:4:58,48
It was like ah, that burns.


104
0:4:58,48 --> 0:5:1,3
I quickly washed it off
because I was scared.


105
0:5:1,3 --> 0:5:2,51
I was like, what is
this going to do?


106
0:5:2,51 --> 0:5:5,73
It kind of swelled up and my
heart started pounding, not


107
0:5:5,73 --> 0:5:7,43
because of the venom, because
it was like, oh my god, is


108
0:5:7,43 --> 0:5:8,81
this going to stop?


109
0:5:8,81 --> 0:5:9,61
Is it going to kill me?


110
0:5:9,61 --> 0:5:12,87
I had no idea.


111
0:5:12,87 --> 0:5:15,44
Since people have kind of heard
what I've been doing and


112
0:5:15,44 --> 0:5:17,67
stuff like that, I've seen
a lot of people bitching.


113
0:5:17,67 --> 0:5:19,89
They're worse than like "Star
Trek" fans, to be honest with


114
0:5:19,89 --> 0:5:23,3
you, reptile people sometimes.


115
0:5:23,3 --> 0:5:25,65
I always thought when the
internet came, I was like,


116
0:5:25,65 --> 0:5:27,98
wow, you can communicate with
other people that have the


117
0:5:27,98 --> 0:5:30,7
same passion about
these animals.


118
0:5:30,7 --> 0:5:31,92
But it's not the case.


119
0:5:31,92 --> 0:5:36,39
There's a lot of bitchiness and
who has the biggest snake.


120
0:5:36,39 --> 0:5:37,37
I don't keep big snakes.


121
0:5:37,37 --> 0:5:39,86
Guys that keep big snakes
are hiding a secret.


122
0:5:39,86 --> 0:5:42,83



123
0:5:42,83 --> 0:5:46,11
This is the last hemotoxic
snake that goes into my


124
0:5:46,11 --> 0:5:47,67
snakebite cocktail.


125
0:5:47,67 --> 0:5:49,3
This is called an
eyelash viper.


126
0:5:49,3 --> 0:5:51,38
This is one of the scariest
snakes that I own.


127
0:5:51,38 --> 0:5:52,75
This the snake that bit me.


128
0:5:52,75 --> 0:5:55,786
The worst pain that I've
ever had in my life.


129
0:5:55,786 --> 0:5:57,89
And I've had lots of accidents
with venom.


130
0:5:57,89 --> 0:6:1,69
But it felt like you had put
your hand down on a marble


131
0:6:1,69 --> 0:6:5,33
table and someone took a
sledgehammer and smashed it


132
0:6:5,33 --> 0:6:6,54
onto your pinky.


133
0:6:6,54 --> 0:6:9,98
But the funny thing is that that
pain never subsided for


134
0:6:9,98 --> 0:6:11,32
eight fucking hours.


135
0:6:11,32 --> 0:6:13,81
And I had some scientists in the
States saying get yourself


136
0:6:13,81 --> 0:6:14,43
to the hospital.


137
0:6:14,43 --> 0:6:16,42
This is not a good snake
to be bitten by.


138
0:6:16,42 --> 0:6:17,47
But I kind of waited it out.


139
0:6:17,47 --> 0:6:19,77
I had confidence that I
was going to be OK.


140
0:6:19,77 --> 0:6:22,9
But it's a really aggressive
snake, and it's


141
0:6:22,9 --> 0:6:23,42
really tricky to milk.


142
0:6:23,42 --> 0:6:27,112



143
0:6:27,112 --> 0:6:28,2
There you go.


144
0:6:28,2 --> 0:6:30,875
Whoa, there's lots of venom
coming out there.


145
0:6:30,875 --> 0:6:32,29
Thank you.


146
0:6:32,29 --> 0:6:33,58
So those are our hemotoxins.


147
0:6:33,58 --> 0:6:38,28



148
0:6:38,28 --> 0:6:42,48
I posted a really beautiful
snake that I have on YouTube.


149
0:6:42,48 --> 0:6:44,51
It's called a macrops
pit viper.


150
0:6:44,51 --> 0:6:46,3
Just because I'm handling
this snake,


151
0:6:46,3 --> 0:6:47,54
it's called free handling.


152
0:6:47,54 --> 0:6:51,12
There's death threats and people
have just gone crazy.


153
0:6:51,12 --> 0:6:53,24
I could poke it in my eye
a million times and


154
0:6:53,24 --> 0:6:55,69
it would not bite.


155
0:6:55,69 --> 0:6:58,4
"These snakes can and
will kill you.


156
0:6:58,4 --> 0:7:0,13
Everybody take a
good long look.


157
0:7:0,13 --> 0:7:3,58
The moron attached to that arm
is the reason why you have


158
0:7:3,58 --> 0:7:6,94
trouble keeping your reptiles
legally." I'm not a moron


159
0:7:6,94 --> 0:7:8,48
attached to this arm.


160
0:7:8,48 --> 0:7:11,12
Oh, yes I am.


161
0:7:11,12 --> 0:7:14,2
"To think we lock up pedophiles
and murderers when


162
0:7:14,2 --> 0:7:17,3
sickos like this are free
to roam our streets.


163
0:7:17,3 --> 0:7:20,76
What's wrong with the world
these days?" Now, I think


164
0:7:20,76 --> 0:7:23,26
that's somebody being
sarcastic.


165
0:7:23,26 --> 0:7:25,7
OK, here is a good one.


166
0:7:25,7 --> 0:7:28,92
"You, to put it kindly, are
an ignorant fucktard.


167
0:7:28,92 --> 0:7:33,3
I sincerely hope you
get bit hard.


168
0:7:33,3 --> 0:7:36,2
And I strongly dissuade anyone
watching this video from


169
0:7:36,2 --> 0:7:40,2
repeating the actions of this
small-penised individual.


170
0:7:40,2 --> 0:7:43,56
Stupid dick hammer."
Now, that's good.


171
0:7:43,56 --> 0:7:44,81
That's good.


172
0:7:44,81 --> 0:7:48,84



173
0:7:48,84 --> 0:7:52,49
This next snake is the Naja
kaouthia which is responsible


174
0:7:52,49 --> 0:7:54,65
for a lot of deaths
every year.


175
0:7:54,65 --> 0:7:56,71
In the time that I've been
working with this snake, I've


176
0:7:56,71 --> 0:7:59,63
had some injections where I was
a little bit cocky with it


177
0:7:59,63 --> 0:8:2,93
and got the dilution
sort of wrong.


178
0:8:2,93 --> 0:8:4,35
They were like volcanoes.


179
0:8:4,35 --> 0:8:5,2
I had three of them.


180
0:8:5,2 --> 0:8:7,59
I had two on this leg
and one down here.


181
0:8:7,59 --> 0:8:9,94
And they were growing and
growing and burning.


182
0:8:9,94 --> 0:8:11,46
And for days, I was
like, oh god, I


183
0:8:11,46 --> 0:8:12,96
could feel this pressure.


184
0:8:12,96 --> 0:8:15,89
I touched it and goo
shot out five foot


185
0:8:15,89 --> 0:8:17,5
across onto the carpet.


186
0:8:17,5 --> 0:8:19,36
And I was just like,
oh my god.


187
0:8:19,36 --> 0:8:20,49
Oh fuck.


188
0:8:20,49 --> 0:8:23,2
I'm fucked here.


189
0:8:23,2 --> 0:8:25,52
And I got this massive
needle for


190
0:8:25,52 --> 0:8:27,35
injecting horses or something.


191
0:8:27,35 --> 0:8:31,1
I put on some ACDC and it just
gave me the strength just to--


192
0:8:31,1 --> 0:8:34,59
against all your will, just push
this down and you could


193
0:8:34,59 --> 0:8:35,94
feel it going down
into something.


194
0:8:35,94 --> 0:8:37,39
Do I have the nucleus yet?


195
0:8:37,39 --> 0:8:38,49
I'm pulling on this.


196
0:8:38,49 --> 0:8:39,429
No, I don't think I've
got the nucleus.


197
0:8:39,429 --> 0:8:40,78
I think I've gone through it.


198
0:8:40,78 --> 0:8:43,343
Pull it back out, hit the
nucleus, and it was just like


199
0:8:43,343 --> 0:8:48,61
pwaaachh, just pulling back on
the most disgusting stuff that


200
0:8:48,61 --> 0:8:50,43
you'd ever want to see.


201
0:8:50,43 --> 0:8:52,28
And I was like, oh, I'm just
going to squeeze it.


202
0:8:52,28 --> 0:8:55,23
And I squeezed this, but it
actually made a sound.


203
0:8:55,23 --> 0:8:57,4
It was like peuh.


204
0:8:57,4 --> 0:8:58,39
I looked down in there
and there was a


205
0:8:58,39 --> 0:9:0,1
fucking hole in my leg.


206
0:9:0,1 --> 0:9:3,696
I could see inside my leg where
all the tissue had sort


207
0:9:3,696 --> 0:9:4,91
of rotted away.


208
0:9:4,91 --> 0:9:7,96
And I noticed flies coming
to it immediately.


209
0:9:7,96 --> 0:9:9,4
And it stunk.


210
0:9:9,4 --> 0:9:10,5
It was like death.


211
0:9:10,5 --> 0:9:11,385
It was rotting.


212
0:9:11,385 --> 0:9:13,308
I never want that
happening again.


213
0:9:13,308 --> 0:9:16,296



214
0:9:16,296 --> 0:9:18,79
You hear it?


215
0:9:18,79 --> 0:9:20,68
This is not the hemotoxic
snake.


216
0:9:20,68 --> 0:9:23,713
This is something that's got
the neurotoxin, the Naja


217
0:9:23,713 --> 0:9:27,93
kaouthia, which is the
monocled cobra.


218
0:9:27,93 --> 0:9:29,18
Simple.


219
0:9:29,18 --> 0:9:33,74



220
0:9:33,74 --> 0:9:37,21
And let go.


221
0:9:37,21 --> 0:9:41,12



222
0:9:41,12 --> 0:9:43,94
Since I've kind of discovered
the possibilities with the


223
0:9:43,94 --> 0:9:48,13
neurotoxins in this cobra venom,
I've been using it in


224
0:9:48,13 --> 0:9:51,195
sporting activities recently
and kind of testing it.


225
0:9:51,195 --> 0:9:54,93
It's Kind of added a little
bit of extra speed into my


226
0:9:54,93 --> 0:9:56,18
normal abilities.


227
0:9:56,18 --> 0:9:59,19



228
0:9:59,19 --> 0:10:2,97
I've been doing tests on my
skateboard from my house into


229
0:10:2,97 --> 0:10:3,72
the West End.


230
0:10:3,72 --> 0:10:5,26
I see how fast I can
get in there.


231
0:10:5,26 --> 0:10:7,9
I just use the roads, and
I think the cobra


232
0:10:7,9 --> 0:10:8,9
venom helps with that.


233
0:10:8,9 --> 0:10:11,6
It's just sort of like, I go
in between cars, I go in


234
0:10:11,6 --> 0:10:12,91
between buses, I go in the
middle of the road.


235
0:10:12,91 --> 0:10:14,32
I just cane it.


236
0:10:14,32 --> 0:10:18,522
I feel like I've got so
much energy and speed.


237
0:10:18,522 --> 0:10:21,4
When I'm skating, I've learned
to actually start


238
0:10:21,4 --> 0:10:22,296
moving like a snake.


239
0:10:22,296 --> 0:10:25,7
And I found myself just kind
of using that S-shape--


240
0:10:25,7 --> 0:10:28,716
carving and carving, and it
actually starts giving you a


241
0:10:28,716 --> 0:10:30,6
little bit of power.


242
0:10:30,6 --> 0:10:34,82



243
0:10:34,82 --> 0:10:38,99
-William Haast, director of the
Serpetarium, has had much


244
0:10:38,99 --> 0:10:41,67
experience in handling cobras.


245
0:10:41,67 --> 0:10:45,14
But he still treats them with
the greatest respect.


246
0:10:45,14 --> 0:10:48,66
Gather 'round, folks,
but not too close.


247
0:10:48,66 --> 0:10:50,74
STEVE LUDWIN: Bill Haast really
is my Beatles and


248
0:10:50,74 --> 0:10:53,46
Rolling Stones and Beach Boys
all wrapped in one.


249
0:10:53,46 --> 0:10:54,6
He died last year.


250
0:10:54,6 --> 0:10:57,8
He was just like two
weeks shy of 101.


251
0:10:57,8 --> 0:10:59,85
He'd say that he hasn't been
sick a day in his life, and it


252
0:10:59,85 --> 0:11:2,73
made me start thinking, OK, wow,
there's something here.


253
0:11:2,73 --> 0:11:5,4
He was really my parameter
of sort of


254
0:11:5,4 --> 0:11:6,87
going, is this dangerous?


255
0:11:6,87 --> 0:11:10,24
It's working for this guy.


256
0:11:10,24 --> 0:11:13,59
He was treating people with
polio, people with MS. He had


257
0:11:13,59 --> 0:11:15,59
like 4,000 patients.


258
0:11:15,59 --> 0:11:17,33
He had people that couldn't
even walk.


259
0:11:17,33 --> 0:11:21,37
And with the right doses and the
right ingredients of his


260
0:11:21,37 --> 0:11:24,9
medicines that contained various
snake venoms, people--


261
0:11:24,9 --> 0:11:25,52
I've seen footage of it--


262
0:11:25,52 --> 0:11:26,72
they're playing basketball.


263
0:11:26,72 --> 0:11:30,32
But the FDA heard about what he
was doing and they shut him


264
0:11:30,32 --> 0:11:33,44
down, even though he was having
such success with it.


265
0:11:33,44 --> 0:11:35,35
But the other thing that
Bill Haast did,


266
0:11:35,35 --> 0:11:36,85
which is totally amazing--


267
0:11:36,85 --> 0:11:37,5
it's miraculous.


268
0:11:37,5 --> 0:11:40,81
It almost sounds
like a messiah.


269
0:11:40,81 --> 0:11:44,26
Because he was immune to these
snake venoms, he's given his


270
0:11:44,26 --> 0:11:47,53
blood to snakebite victims
that are dying,


271
0:11:47,53 --> 0:11:48,78
and then they survive.


272
0:11:48,78 --> 0:11:51,56



273
0:11:51,56 --> 0:11:52,6
I've milked all the snakes.


274
0:11:52,6 --> 0:11:55,66
And I've got hemotoxins
in one glass.


275
0:11:55,66 --> 0:11:58,12
This is the one that kind
of had the cocktails.


276
0:11:58,12 --> 0:12:1,23
So I'm drawing that venom
up into this syringe.


277
0:12:1,23 --> 0:12:2,87
So here's what I was
saying earlier.


278
0:12:2,87 --> 0:12:5,18
There's no such thing as
a poisonous snake.


279
0:12:5,18 --> 0:12:6,16
It is not poison.


280
0:12:6,16 --> 0:12:7,82
You see that venom
coming out there?


281
0:12:7,82 --> 0:12:9,39
See it on my finger?


282
0:12:9,39 --> 0:12:11,42
You can do this.


283
0:12:11,42 --> 0:12:12,845
Completely safely.


284
0:12:12,845 --> 0:12:15,33
If you don't freeze it,
it's just like food.


285
0:12:15,33 --> 0:12:16,78
It's a protein, it
breaks down.


286
0:12:16,78 --> 0:12:23,55
So I have months and months
worth of various venoms.


287
0:12:23,55 --> 0:12:24,95
This is the hemotoxin.


288
0:12:24,95 --> 0:12:29,34
I'm going to put six.


289
0:12:29,34 --> 0:12:32,445
What I have here is water
for injections.


290
0:12:32,445 --> 0:12:40,8



291
0:12:40,8 --> 0:12:44,25
I will start on the actual raw
venom, and then what we'll do


292
0:12:44,25 --> 0:12:45,59
is we'll use that injection.


293
0:12:45,59 --> 0:12:48,5



294
0:12:48,5 --> 0:12:50,99
The first time I tried
using the snake


295
0:12:50,99 --> 0:12:52,99
venom was pretty scary.


296
0:12:52,99 --> 0:12:55,15
There was no internet
back then.


297
0:12:55,15 --> 0:12:56,51
But it felt really natural.


298
0:12:56,51 --> 0:12:58,91
It felt like it was instinct.


299
0:12:58,91 --> 0:13:1,66



300
0:13:1,66 --> 0:13:3,4
This is not diluted.


301
0:13:3,4 --> 0:13:5,4
This is the pure venom.


302
0:13:5,4 --> 0:13:6,41
So now, we're going
to do an injection


303
0:13:6,41 --> 0:13:7,66
with the diluted hemotoxin.


304
0:13:7,66 --> 0:13:10,17



305
0:13:10,17 --> 0:13:13,69
The benefits to the hemotoxins,
I'm not too sure.


306
0:13:13,69 --> 0:13:16,25
I feel like I need another
20 years to do it.


307
0:13:16,25 --> 0:13:20,79
I had some doctors test my DNA
telomeres and when I was 42, I


308
0:13:20,79 --> 0:13:22,65
scored as a 28-year-old.


309
0:13:22,65 --> 0:13:24,64
Perhaps there are
some anti-aging


310
0:13:24,64 --> 0:13:26,6
properties to snake venom.


311
0:13:26,6 --> 0:13:28,1
It could all end tomorrow
as well.


312
0:13:28,1 --> 0:13:31,45
I'm not saying I'm invincible.


313
0:13:31,45 --> 0:13:34,76
This is the shot glass that
has the cobra venom, the


314
0:13:34,76 --> 0:13:36,1
neurotoxin.


315
0:13:36,1 --> 0:13:37,68



316
0:13:37,68 --> 0:13:39,89
Get it all out.


317
0:13:39,89 --> 0:13:42,76
I'm going with two
drops of this.


318
0:13:42,76 --> 0:13:46,54
This actual cobra that we're
using is more venomous than a


319
0:13:46,54 --> 0:13:47,33
king cobra.


320
0:13:47,33 --> 0:13:55,338
One drop of cobra venom can
kill 20 to 30 grown men.


321
0:13:55,338 --> 0:13:56,588
Yeow.


322
0:13:56,588 --> 0:13:59,29



323
0:13:59,29 --> 0:14:0,6
Yeah, I mean it just feels--


324
0:14:0,6 --> 0:14:1,45
yeow.


325
0:14:1,45 --> 0:14:3,78
Feels like a bee sting
to start off with.


326
0:14:3,78 --> 0:14:6,83
That cobra venom does have
a bit of pain to it.


327
0:14:6,83 --> 0:14:13,59
It's like "Man Versus Food,"
spicy chicken challenge.


328
0:14:13,59 --> 0:14:16,7
Oh, you motherfucker.


329
0:14:16,7 --> 0:14:17,24
I'm 46 now.


330
0:14:17,24 --> 0:14:20,61
I'll have to see how many years
I can go on continuing


331
0:14:20,61 --> 0:14:21,31
doing this.


332
0:14:21,31 --> 0:14:25,1
But you do think that it is
quite taxing on the body.


333
0:14:25,1 --> 0:14:28,39
It is possible in two years
time, my kidneys fail and I


334
0:14:28,39 --> 0:14:31,24
die due to the venom of all
those years, of all those


335
0:14:31,24 --> 0:14:34,58
toxins, all the swelling,
all the decomposing


336
0:14:34,58 --> 0:14:36,22
flesh and the bruising.


337
0:14:36,22 --> 0:14:38,93
It all has to filter through
your kidneys and your liver.


338
0:14:38,93 --> 0:14:43,55
And it's really bad stuff to
be going through there.


339
0:14:43,55 --> 0:14:44,74
Yeow, OK.


340
0:14:44,74 --> 0:14:48,96
That was a little bit
more than five mil.


341
0:14:48,96 --> 0:14:50,25
People want to know what
it feels like.


342
0:14:50,25 --> 0:14:53,6
It feels like injecting
Tabasco sauce and


343
0:14:53,6 --> 0:14:54,12
rubbing it in a cut.


344
0:14:54,12 --> 0:14:56,3
It just burns.


345
0:14:56,3 --> 0:15:3,5
I will take another syringe
here, and just basically bring


346
0:15:3,5 --> 0:15:8,8
that raw venom down with the
needle, which I quite


347
0:15:8,8 --> 0:15:10,32
like to work that.


348
0:15:10,32 --> 0:15:12,8
Diluting is something that's
been quite new to me over like


349
0:15:12,8 --> 0:15:14,97
the last four years that
I've learned how


350
0:15:14,97 --> 0:15:16,88
to do and work properly.


351
0:15:16,88 --> 0:15:19,99
I was a bit nervous today when
I was milking the snakes.


352
0:15:19,99 --> 0:15:22,17
But when I do these injections,
I don't think


353
0:15:22,17 --> 0:15:23,54
anything of that.


354
0:15:23,54 --> 0:15:27,24
Once I know that the dilutions
are right, it's as normal as


355
0:15:27,24 --> 0:15:29,72
anything for me now.


356
0:15:29,72 --> 0:15:32,75
I always kind of note the time
just in case if I ever did


357
0:15:32,75 --> 0:15:36,9
have any problems where I did
need to visit the hospital


358
0:15:36,9 --> 0:15:37,34
again, I would know.


359
0:15:37,34 --> 0:15:42,712



360
0:15:42,712 --> 0:15:47,22
The one time I did have a
serious overdose, I injected


361
0:15:47,22 --> 0:15:49,54
three raw venoms a
couple years ago.


362
0:15:49,54 --> 0:15:51,76
And I only wanted to put
down a little bit in.


363
0:15:51,76 --> 0:15:53,63
And as I was pressing
it, just ooop--


364
0:15:53,63 --> 0:15:54,74
the whole thing went in.


365
0:15:54,74 --> 0:15:59,7
Within 45 minutes, my hand
was like a baseball mitt.


366
0:15:59,7 --> 0:16:1,41
The venom was swimming
in my body.


367
0:16:1,41 --> 0:16:2,73
I had some friends
come over because


368
0:16:2,73 --> 0:16:4,28
they knew I was fucked.


369
0:16:4,28 --> 0:16:5,97
They were saying, go to the
hospital, go to the hospital.


370
0:16:5,97 --> 0:16:6,96
And I just didn't want to.


371
0:16:6,96 --> 0:16:9,21
And the next morning, I kept
on waking up and it wasn't


372
0:16:9,21 --> 0:16:9,77
going down.


373
0:16:9,77 --> 0:16:12,54
So I got begged to go
to the hospital.


374
0:16:12,54 --> 0:16:14,62
They saw my arm and they
said, what happened?


375
0:16:14,62 --> 0:16:15,8
And I said snakebite.


376
0:16:15,8 --> 0:16:18,615
Three doctors came out
and they said, well,


377
0:16:18,615 --> 0:16:19,65
what snake bit you?


378
0:16:19,65 --> 0:16:23,9
And I had to just say, well,
I didn't get bit.


379
0:16:23,9 --> 0:16:24,34
There's three snakes.


380
0:16:24,34 --> 0:16:26,59
I purposely injected
it into my arm.


381
0:16:26,59 --> 0:16:28,79
They didn't know what to say,
and the next thing I know, I


382
0:16:28,79 --> 0:16:30,5
was being taken into
another room.


383
0:16:30,5 --> 0:16:32,85
And one of the female doctors
just came in and was just


384
0:16:32,85 --> 0:16:34,72
yelling at me and just
saying, you idiot.


385
0:16:34,72 --> 0:16:36,7
You can't do this.


386
0:16:36,7 --> 0:16:37,84
And they were telling me you're
going to die, and


387
0:16:37,84 --> 0:16:40,0
you're going to lose your arm.


388
0:16:40,0 --> 0:16:42,24
I was in intensive care
for three days.


389
0:16:42,24 --> 0:16:45,99
But I was kind of calm
throughout the whole thing.


390
0:16:45,99 --> 0:16:47,465
I don't want to ever
repeat it.


391
0:16:47,465 --> 0:17:0,88



392
0:17:0,88 --> 0:17:4,109
Since I had heard that the
Americans and the Chinese got


393
0:17:4,109 --> 0:17:7,5
busted injecting race horses
with cobra venom and it was


394
0:17:7,5 --> 0:17:9,589
making them outperform
their abilities, I


395
0:17:9,589 --> 0:17:10,66
immediately got excited.


396
0:17:10,66 --> 0:17:14,74
And I thought boxing would be a
great thing to kind of see--


397
0:17:14,74 --> 0:17:16,695
is it possible that I could
outperform my ability?


398
0:17:16,695 --> 0:17:20,2



399
0:17:20,2 --> 0:17:23,93
I was working it harder last
year when I was on my own.


400
0:17:23,93 --> 0:17:26,0
I actually felt like something
was happening.


401
0:17:26,0 --> 0:17:28,53
I was like holy shit, this
stuff is working.


402
0:17:28,53 --> 0:17:29,406
It's amazing.


403
0:17:29,406 --> 0:17:31,53
You're discreet, but you can
get away with it in London.


404
0:17:31,53 --> 0:17:37,55



405
0:17:37,55 --> 0:17:39,244
Bear Grylls.


406
0:17:39,244 --> 0:17:40,76
I hate that guy.


407
0:17:40,76 --> 0:17:43,62
In those films, he's like,
oh, here's the snake.


408
0:17:43,62 --> 0:17:44,87
And you can just bit
its head off.


409
0:17:44,87 --> 0:17:45,5
And he does.


410
0:17:45,5 --> 0:17:47,23
He's killed snakes on TV.


411
0:17:47,23 --> 0:17:49,78
That's my fucking family you're
fucking around with.


412
0:17:49,78 --> 0:17:51,3
Sorry, just kidding.


413
0:17:51,3 --> 0:17:54,78



414
0:17:54,78 --> 0:17:57,67
One thing I have noticed is that
I'm not really feeling


415
0:17:57,67 --> 0:18:0,33
the pain, so that could be the
other thing that helped those


416
0:18:0,33 --> 0:18:1,45
horses along.


417
0:18:1,45 --> 0:18:4,23
Why not find out why it's
doing these things.


418
0:18:4,23 --> 0:18:6,33
If it's taking away pain,
if it's giving you


419
0:18:6,33 --> 0:18:7,74
confidence, or whatever.


420
0:18:7,74 --> 0:18:9,905
Why not give it to your army?


421
0:18:9,905 --> 0:18:16,88



422
0:18:16,88 --> 0:18:19,4
Christopher Columbus didn't
go looking for America to


423
0:18:19,4 --> 0:18:20,19
discover America.


424
0:18:20,19 --> 0:18:22,85
He was looking for the
fountain of youth.


425
0:18:22,85 --> 0:18:24,89
What does mankind want?


426
0:18:24,89 --> 0:18:26,1
They want to live longer.


427
0:18:26,1 --> 0:18:27,26
Everyone wants to live longer.


428
0:18:27,26 --> 0:18:38,24



429
0:18:38,24 --> 0:18:42,4
Apparently, there's something in
snake venom that helps its


430
0:18:42,4 --> 0:18:44,86
food to accept death.


431
0:18:44,86 --> 0:18:48,35



432
0:18:48,35 --> 0:18:49,76
I did feel that once.


433
0:18:49,76 --> 0:18:52,4
As I was lying there, and I
could feel the numbness in my


434
0:18:52,4 --> 0:18:58,29
head and stuff, I had this
complete feeling of, oh well,


435
0:18:58,29 --> 0:19:1,33
I might die here, but I felt
really happy to die.


436
0:19:1,33 --> 0:19:12,26



437
0:19:12,26 --> 0:19:14,42
My heart's pounding.


438
0:19:14,42 --> 0:19:17,86
You're alive for a good
6 to 12 hours.


439
0:19:17,86 --> 0:19:22,3
Like Starbucks has
nothing on this.


440
0:19:22,3 --> 0:19:25,91
Yeah, I must admit that
it doesn't feel great.


441
0:19:25,91 --> 0:19:28,89
It's kind of like
Jell-O in there.


442
0:19:28,89 --> 0:19:30,19
And god knows what it's
doing in there.


443
0:19:30,19 --> 0:19:35,77
I wish I understood what's
happening beneath that skin.


444
0:19:35,77 --> 0:19:37,34
The next day is always the same
with the cobra venom.


445
0:19:37,34 --> 0:19:40,2
It just feels like you're
beaten up anyway.


446
0:19:40,2 --> 0:19:43,73
And then I have a good sort of
four days where I feel kind of


447
0:19:43,73 --> 0:19:44,92
quite charged.


448
0:19:44,92 --> 0:19:45,882
Come on, let's box.


449
0:19:45,882 --> 0:19:46,844
Come on.


450
0:19:46,844 --> 0:19:47,806
Come on.


451
0:19:47,806 --> 0:19:49,73
There you go.


452
0:19:49,73 --> 0:19:51,87
-So how many years have
you been doing this?


453
0:19:51,87 --> 0:19:53,73
STEVE LUDWIN: Over 20 years,
probably like 22 years--


454
0:19:53,73 --> 0:19:55,23
-So you've been quite
lucky then, really.


455
0:19:55,23 --> 0:19:59,3
Is there a risk that you
take that venom and it


456
0:19:59,3 --> 0:19:59,99
could just kill you?


457
0:19:59,99 --> 0:20:2,51
STEVE LUDWIN: It is kind of a
little bit playing with fire.


458
0:20:2,51 --> 0:20:6,55
I've had maybe three incidents
in my life where it was


459
0:20:6,55 --> 0:20:8,11
borderline life threatening.


460
0:20:8,11 --> 0:20:10,8
-What you're saying is it's
similar to someone taking


461
0:20:10,8 --> 0:20:12,24
heroin or cocaine
and injecting it


462
0:20:12,24 --> 0:20:13,32
and taking a gamble.


463
0:20:13,32 --> 0:20:15,9
So you're gambling with your
life every time you take it.


464
0:20:15,9 --> 0:20:18,34
STEVE LUDWIN: I've gotten so
used to it, I do it without


465
0:20:18,34 --> 0:20:19,6
thinking about it.


466
0:20:19,6 --> 0:20:22,86
And because I know the amounts
and I know not to push it and


467
0:20:22,86 --> 0:20:24,69
where not to push it
and stuff, it seems


468
0:20:24,69 --> 0:20:25,66
really safe to me.


469
0:20:25,66 --> 0:20:28,21
This certainly isn't physically
addictive or it


470
0:20:28,21 --> 0:20:29,2
isn't pleasurable.


471
0:20:29,2 --> 0:20:30,84
-So you believe you could stop
tomorrow and stop taking it,


472
0:20:30,84 --> 0:20:31,834
stop doing it?


473
0:20:31,834 --> 0:20:32,83
STEVE LUDWIN: Yeah.


474
0:20:32,83 --> 0:20:33,3
Yeah.


475
0:20:33,3 --> 0:20:34,49
I'd like to do that very soon.


476
0:20:34,49 --> 0:20:35,46
I've done it for so long.


477
0:20:35,46 --> 0:20:37,24
I'd like to actually spend--


478
0:20:37,24 --> 0:20:38,68
I'd like to take a year off.


479
0:20:38,68 --> 0:20:40,448
-And you've done that,
you managed that?


480
0:20:40,448 --> 0:20:42,1
STEVE LUDWIN: No, I've
never done it.


481
0:20:42,1 --> 0:20:43,37
I've never not done it.


482
0:20:43,37 --> 0:20:44,84
But I'd like to take
like a year off.


483
0:20:44,84 --> 0:20:47,9
-So you're not going to know
if it's addictive until you


484
0:20:47,9 --> 0:20:47,91
try it, are you?


485
0:20:47,91 --> 0:20:50,78
-Is it possible you could be
addicted to pain then, if you


486
0:20:50,78 --> 0:20:51,883
know what I mean?


487
0:20:51,883 --> 0:20:53,5
The way it hurts.


488
0:20:53,5 --> 0:20:56,82
STEVE LUDWIN: I think if I was,
I would have other things


489
0:20:56,82 --> 0:20:57,26
in my life.


490
0:20:57,26 --> 0:20:59,208
I'd be a boxer like you.


491
0:20:59,208 --> 0:21:0,458
-Yeah, true, true, true.


492
0:21:0,458 --> 0:21:3,591



493
0:21:3,591 --> 0:21:7,17
STEVE LUDWIN: The day after
going boxing, my arm just was


494
0:21:7,17 --> 0:21:9,36
even more swollen than
the day before.


495
0:21:9,36 --> 0:21:11,86
But I felt like a truck
had hit me.


496
0:21:11,86 --> 0:21:15,52
I felt like I was being digested
from the inside.


497
0:21:15,52 --> 0:21:19,26
I was walking around like the
Elephant Man for a day.


498
0:21:19,26 --> 0:21:22,11
I can kind of remember it, but
I was like in a dream state.


499
0:21:22,11 --> 0:21:26,81
I felt like I had been injected
with a thousand


500
0:21:26,81 --> 0:21:28,29
energy drinks.


501
0:21:28,29 --> 0:21:31,56
It just felt slightly wrong.


502
0:21:31,56 --> 0:21:38,8



503
0:21:38,8 --> 0:21:41,42
I would really like to work
with a forward-thinking


504
0:21:41,42 --> 0:21:44,91
company that is going to go,
OK kid, we like your ideas.


505
0:21:44,91 --> 0:21:46,61
Let's start researching this.


506
0:21:46,61 --> 0:21:50,84
And around-the-clock
and get it done.


507
0:21:50,84 --> 0:21:53,83
I visited the University of
Southern California a couple


508
0:21:53,83 --> 0:21:56,79
years ago, and I met a professor
Frank Markland, I


509
0:21:56,79 --> 0:21:57,75
believe his name is.


510
0:21:57,75 --> 0:22:0,39
He's been working with
copperhead venom.


511
0:22:0,39 --> 0:22:3,17
Copperhead venom is the North
American pit viper that's


512
0:22:3,17 --> 0:22:3,92
being used.


513
0:22:3,92 --> 0:22:6,56
They've been studying the
effects on breast cancer


514
0:22:6,56 --> 0:22:8,56
cells, ovarian cancer.


515
0:22:8,56 --> 0:22:12,99
It actually inhibits the growth
of tumors and basically


516
0:22:12,99 --> 0:22:14,59
kind of kills off
cancer cells.


517
0:22:14,59 --> 0:22:18,66
So there there's real excitement
around that.


518
0:22:18,66 --> 0:22:22,24
Yeah, the possibilities of a
cancer cure someday with snake


519
0:22:22,24 --> 0:22:23,83
venom, I'd put my money on it.


520
0:22:23,83 --> 0:22:40,594



521
0:22:40,594 --> 0:22:41,844
Banana?


522
0:22:41,844 --> 0:22:45,904



523
0:22:45,904 --> 0:22:47,154
Banana.


524
0:22:47,154 --> 0:24:47,154
