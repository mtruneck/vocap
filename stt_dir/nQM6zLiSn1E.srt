1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,7
RYAN DUFFY: Hey,
I'm Ryan Duffy.


2
0:0:1,7 --> 0:0:3,79
And a few years ago, I got on
a plane, went to Bogota,


3
0:0:3,79 --> 0:0:6,8
Colombia, and asked a man
to shoot me in the ribs.


4
0:0:6,8 --> 0:0:13,115



5
0:0:13,115 --> 0:0:15,11
The tailor's name was
Miguel Caballero.


6
0:0:15,11 --> 0:0:19,14
He prefers his nickname, which
is the Armored Armani, which


7
0:0:19,14 --> 0:0:19,54
is pretty good.


8
0:0:19,54 --> 0:0:21,46
I mean, I don't blame the guy.


9
0:0:21,46 --> 0:0:25,14
He took us on this big tour and
he showed us a facility in


10
0:0:25,14 --> 0:0:28,1
the warehouse where he
did the shooting,


11
0:0:28,1 --> 0:0:29,4
and he did the testing.


12
0:0:29,4 --> 0:0:31,87
And it's a proper place with
soundproofed thing and the


13
0:0:31,87 --> 0:0:32,71
whole thing.


14
0:0:32,71 --> 0:0:33,95
I figured we'd be going
down there.


15
0:0:33,95 --> 0:0:35,62
All of a sudden, we're just
halfway through the interview,


16
0:0:35,62 --> 0:0:37,71
and we're sitting in his office,
and he goes, OK.


17
0:0:37,71 --> 0:0:38,42
You want to get shot?


18
0:0:38,42 --> 0:0:39,41
I was like, yeah, we might
as well do it.


19
0:0:39,41 --> 0:0:41,17
And I went to go get up,
and he's like, no, no.


20
0:0:41,17 --> 0:0:41,86
I got it right here.


21
0:0:41,86 --> 0:0:43,86
Pulls it out of his desk drawer
and stands up and


22
0:0:43,86 --> 0:0:47,7
shoots me in his office
from six feet away.


23
0:0:47,7 --> 0:0:50,33
So here it is, my mom's least
favorite piece of all time.


24
0:0:50,33 --> 0:0:54,9
Vice presents "The Bulletproof
Tailor."


25
0:0:54,9 --> 0:0:56,85
So we're here in Bogota,
Colombia, and we're about to


26
0:0:56,85 --> 0:0:58,45
go see Miguel Caballero,
who's been


27
0:0:58,45 --> 0:0:59,98
called the Armored Armani.


28
0:0:59,98 --> 0:1:3,63
He makes bulletproof gear, but
he makes fashion-forward


29
0:1:3,63 --> 0:1:4,879
lightweight bulletproof gear.


30
0:1:4,879 --> 0:1:8,26
So a nice blazer or an
overcoat, and even a


31
0:1:8,26 --> 0:1:9,42
bulletproof tie.


32
0:1:9,42 --> 0:1:12,0
The basic deal is for bodyguards
and for kind of


33
0:1:12,0 --> 0:1:15,76
VIPs, people who want to look
good and somewhat sharp and be


34
0:1:15,76 --> 0:1:18,72
comfortable while they're
being shot at.


35
0:1:18,72 --> 0:1:21,17
You would think that with the
direction of world events,


36
0:1:21,17 --> 0:1:24,41
Miguel will probably be very
busy for a very long time.


37
0:1:24,41 --> 0:1:26,65
So we're going to go talk to
Miguel, see how everything is


38
0:1:26,65 --> 0:1:28,9
made, and see if he won't
let us take some of


39
0:1:28,9 --> 0:1:31,68
it for a test drive.


40
0:1:31,68 --> 0:1:35,14
So this is the tailoring
area of Miguel's shop.


41
0:1:35,14 --> 0:1:38,8
All these women are working on
bulletproof vests and shirts


42
0:1:38,8 --> 0:1:41,676
and jackets for United
Nations, for various


43
0:1:41,676 --> 0:1:44,67
presidents, for local
police outfits--


44
0:1:44,67 --> 0:1:47,77
pretty much anyone who thinks
it's a reasonable possibility


45
0:1:47,77 --> 0:1:49,19
that they'll get shot.


46
0:1:49,19 --> 0:1:51,39
Where did the idea of
incorporating elements of


47
0:1:51,39 --> 0:1:53,4
actual fashion and design,
rather than just


48
0:1:53,4 --> 0:1:55,1
your standard bulky--


49
0:1:55,1 --> 0:2:17,84



50
0:2:17,84 --> 0:2:19,99
RYAN DUFFY: Do you think this
will be everyday street wear


51
0:2:19,99 --> 0:2:21,83
at some point in the
not-so-distant future?


52
0:2:21,83 --> 0:2:24,73
That everyone will want to feel
protected, just in case?


53
0:2:24,73 --> 0:2:33,385



54
0:2:33,385 --> 0:2:34,635
RYAN DUFFY: Jesus Christ.


55
0:2:34,635 --> 0:2:41,51



56
0:2:41,51 --> 0:2:42,76
[KNOCKING]


57
0:2:42,76 --> 0:2:57,4



58
0:2:57,4 --> 0:2:58,79
RYAN DUFFY: And so does
this one have plates


59
0:2:58,79 --> 0:2:59,912
in there, or no?


60
0:2:59,912 --> 0:3:0,3
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


61
0:3:0,3 --> 0:3:0,575
RYAN DUFFY: Yeah.


62
0:3:0,575 --> 0:3:0,85
FEMALE SPEAKER: The plates do.


63
0:3:0,85 --> 0:3:2,1
RYAN DUFFY: Oh, wow.


64
0:3:2,1 --> 0:3:14,5



65
0:3:14,5 --> 0:3:14,66
FEMALE SPEAKER: How
do you think that?


66
0:3:14,66 --> 0:3:15,19
RYAN DUFFY: It's bulletproof.


67
0:3:15,19 --> 0:3:17,52
It's about as heavy
as a wool sweater.


68
0:3:17,52 --> 0:3:19,27
Almost frighteningly so.


69
0:3:19,27 --> 0:3:46,842



70
0:3:46,842 --> 0:3:49,89
RYAN DUFFY: And we've heard that
all employees get shot.


71
0:3:49,89 --> 0:3:51,72
Is that-- is that part
of the deal?


72
0:3:51,72 --> 0:3:53,2
Everyone tests it out?


73
0:3:53,2 --> 0:4:11,82



74
0:4:11,82 --> 0:4:14,79
RYAN DUFFY: Now we're in the
ballistics area here, and


75
0:4:14,79 --> 0:4:17,73
we're seeing where they kind
of test out all the vests.


76
0:4:17,73 --> 0:4:20,92
So apparently the deal is they
drop the material here, and


77
0:4:20,92 --> 0:4:24,82
then this plaster background
here serves as kind of a


78
0:4:24,82 --> 0:4:27,94
fill-in for the body so they
can see how much impact,


79
0:4:27,94 --> 0:4:30,26
whether the bullet's puncturing
in too far or


80
0:4:30,26 --> 0:4:32,24
whatnot, based on the marks
on the plaster.


81
0:4:32,24 --> 0:4:32,98
Did you get shot?


82
0:4:32,98 --> 0:4:34,85
Do all employees get shot?


83
0:4:34,85 --> 0:4:34,35
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.


84
0:4:34,35 --> 0:4:34,7
RYAN DUFFY: Really?


85
0:4:34,7 --> 0:4:35,768
That's part of the rule?


86
0:4:35,768 --> 0:4:36,624
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


87
0:4:36,624 --> 0:4:39,22
This is the [INAUDIBLE].


88
0:4:39,22 --> 0:4:41,81
RYAN DUFFY: We gotta take
it for a test ride.


89
0:4:41,81 --> 0:4:43,206
Let's fucking shoot
me, Miguel.


90
0:4:43,206 --> 0:4:49,56



91
0:4:49,56 --> 0:4:50,63
And how do you do that?


92
0:4:50,63 --> 0:4:54,37
How can the weight be so
markedly decreased?


93
0:4:54,37 --> 0:4:55,62
So-- so much smaller?


94
0:4:55,62 --> 0:5:17,58



95
0:5:17,58 --> 0:5:18,87
FEMALE SPEAKER: Kimono.


96
0:5:18,87 --> 0:5:22,75
This is for a special design
for Steven Seagal.


97
0:5:22,75 --> 0:5:26,32
RYAN DUFFY: So this, Steven
Seagal came and said, I--


98
0:5:26,32 --> 0:5:28,27
what's his-- who's shooting
at Steven Seagal?


99
0:5:28,27 --> 0:5:29,74
Do you know?


100
0:5:29,74 --> 0:5:30,23
Wow.


101
0:5:30,23 --> 0:5:32,68
He's a big motherfucker,
isn't he?


102
0:5:32,68 --> 0:5:33,93
God damn.


103
0:5:33,93 --> 0:5:37,54



104
0:5:37,54 --> 0:5:39,39
So this is, Steven
Seagal said, I'm


105
0:5:39,39 --> 0:5:40,38
really into this design.


106
0:5:40,38 --> 0:5:41,61
Can you guys make this?


107
0:5:41,61 --> 0:5:43,27
And this was custom-made
for Steven Seagal.


108
0:5:43,27 --> 0:5:43,55
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


109
0:5:43,55 --> 0:5:46,5
We can mail your design
wherever you want.


110
0:5:46,5 --> 0:5:46,58
RYAN DUFFY: Yeah.


111
0:5:46,58 --> 0:5:47,33
Super light.


112
0:5:47,33 --> 0:5:50,1
But this has the padding
in it, right?


113
0:5:50,1 --> 0:5:50,57
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


114
0:5:50,57 --> 0:5:51,51
RYAN DUFFY: So


115
0:5:51,51 --> 0:5:54,6
FEMALE SPEAKER: And look at--
this is very flexible.


116
0:5:54,6 --> 0:5:55,41
RYAN DUFFY: Yeah,
it really is.


117
0:5:55,41 --> 0:5:58,17
You sure that stops bullets?


118
0:5:58,17 --> 0:5:58,64
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


119
0:5:58,64 --> 0:6:0,52
Of course.


120
0:6:0,52 --> 0:6:3,75
RYAN DUFFY: Steven Seagal.


121
0:6:3,75 --> 0:6:6,831
Who are some of the other names
that we would know?


122
0:6:6,831 --> 0:6:39,3



123
0:6:39,3 --> 0:6:40,46
RYAN DUFFY: Where else
are your big markets?


124
0:6:40,46 --> 0:6:58,245



125
0:6:58,245 --> 0:6:59,67
RYAN DUFFY: If I was going
to go into the boutique


126
0:6:59,67 --> 0:7:1,74
in Mexico and just--


127
0:7:1,74 --> 0:7:2,86
I needed something.


128
0:7:2,86 --> 0:7:5,595
What does an average
jacket go for now?


129
0:7:5,595 --> 0:7:41,27



130
0:7:41,27 --> 0:7:42,65
RYAN DUFFY: So where am I
getting shot, exactly?


131
0:7:42,65 --> 0:7:43,24
FEMALE SPEAKER: Here.


132
0:7:43,24 --> 0:7:44,2
RYAN DUFFY: Here?


133
0:7:44,2 --> 0:7:44,44
Really?


134
0:7:44,44 --> 0:7:45,5
That's OK?


135
0:7:45,5 --> 0:7:46,75
It ends right there.


136
0:7:46,75 --> 0:7:53,1



137
0:7:53,1 --> 0:7:54,26
RYAN DUFFY: This is
not heavy-duty.


138
0:7:54,26 --> 0:7:59,25



139
0:7:59,25 --> 0:8:0,33
MIGUEL CABALLERO: One.


140
0:8:0,33 --> 0:8:1,24
One.


141
0:8:1,24 --> 0:8:1,8
RYAN DUFFY: One


142
0:8:1,8 --> 0:8:4,15
MIGUEL CABALLERO: One,
two, three, boom.


143
0:8:4,15 --> 0:8:9,4



144
0:8:9,4 --> 0:8:12,612
One, two, three, boom.


145
0:8:12,612 --> 0:8:13,74
RYAN DUFFY: [EXHALES]


146
0:8:13,74 --> 0:8:13,69
MIGUEL CABALLERO: Yeah, OK.


147
0:8:13,69 --> 0:8:13,998
That's all.


148
0:8:13,998 --> 0:8:16,87
RYAN DUFFY: OK.


149
0:8:16,87 --> 0:8:17,98
RYAN DUFFY: Oh, that's
just muscle?


150
0:8:17,98 --> 0:8:18,23
MIGUEL CABALLERO: Yeah.


151
0:8:18,23 --> 0:8:20,206
RYAN DUFFY: But if it goes
through there, we have a bit


152
0:8:20,206 --> 0:8:20,82
of a problem, right?


153
0:8:20,82 --> 0:8:22,33
There's a bunch of organs
and shit in there.


154
0:8:22,33 --> 0:8:26,68
[LAUGHTER]


155
0:8:26,68 --> 0:8:27,42
MIGUEL CABALLERO: Be
cool, my friend.


156
0:8:27,42 --> 0:8:27,975
Be cool.


157
0:8:27,975 --> 0:8:28,77
RYAN DUFFY: Man, I look cool.


158
0:8:28,77 --> 0:8:30,75
I can't not be cool
in this jacket.


159
0:8:30,75 --> 0:8:32,3
It is suede.


160
0:8:32,3 --> 0:8:33,28
I wonder if it's waterproof.


161
0:8:33,28 --> 0:8:38,659
Oh, you like that with the
collar up a little more, huh?


162
0:8:38,659 --> 0:8:40,84
RYAN DUFFY: We've been told
that Miguel here is the


163
0:8:40,84 --> 0:8:43,72
world's premiere bulletproof
tailor.


164
0:8:43,72 --> 0:8:47,54
But you know, there's a lot of
bullshit in advertising, so


165
0:8:47,54 --> 0:8:48,79
we're gonna take it
for a test ride.


166
0:8:48,79 --> 0:8:56,0



167
0:8:56,0 --> 0:8:57,25
MIGUEL CABALLERO: OK.


168
0:8:57,25 --> 0:9:3,175



169
0:9:3,175 --> 0:9:5,5
Uno, dos--


170
0:9:5,5 --> 0:9:8,608
[GUNSHOT]


171
0:9:8,608 --> 0:9:10,54
MIGUEL CABALLERO: Tres.


172
0:9:10,54 --> 0:9:11,53
Come out here to--


173
0:9:11,53 --> 0:9:12,154
RYAN DUFFY: A little sneak
attack there, huh?


174
0:9:12,154 --> 0:9:12,29
Very clever.


175
0:9:12,29 --> 0:9:14,66
MIGUEL CABALLERO: Check
the bullets.


176
0:9:14,66 --> 0:9:15,45
That's only--


177
0:9:15,45 --> 0:9:15,89
nothing?


178
0:9:15,89 --> 0:9:16,95
RYAN DUFFY: Nothing.


179
0:9:16,95 --> 0:9:18,13
MIGUEL CABALLERO: You felt
something like this, yes?


180
0:9:18,13 --> 0:9:18,45
RYAN DUFFY: Yeah.


181
0:9:18,45 --> 0:9:19,93
Wasn't bad, man.


182
0:9:19,93 --> 0:9:22,63
Oh.


183
0:9:22,63 --> 0:9:24,21
My knee is shaking.


184
0:9:24,21 --> 0:9:26,87



185
0:9:26,87 --> 0:9:27,7
MIGUEL CABALLERO:
That's for you.


186
0:9:27,7 --> 0:9:28,29
It's a souvenir.


187
0:9:28,29 --> 0:9:29,425
RYAN DUFFY: Oh, my souvenir.


188
0:9:29,425 --> 0:9:29,8
Look at that.


189
0:9:29,8 --> 0:9:31,26
MIGUEL CABALLERO: It's
there, you know?


190
0:9:31,26 --> 0:9:35,601
RYAN DUFFY: That's what
he just shot me with.


191
0:9:35,601 --> 0:9:38,92
[GUNSHOT]


192
0:9:38,92 --> 0:9:40,5
MIGUEL CABALLERO: No,
no, don't worry.


193
0:9:40,5 --> 0:9:41,34
RYAN DUFFY: That didn't
hurt nearly as much as


194
0:9:41,34 --> 0:9:42,91
I thought it would.


195
0:9:42,91 --> 0:9:45,38
So that's the bullet and
that's how it ends up.


196
0:9:45,38 --> 0:9:47,35
That's fucking crazy.


197
0:9:47,35 --> 0:9:49,73
He did the pediatrician trick,
like when you go to get a shot


198
0:9:49,73 --> 0:9:51,24
when you're little, and he's
like, on three, I'm


199
0:9:51,24 --> 0:9:51,98
going to stick you.


200
0:9:51,98 --> 0:9:53,84
And you go, one, two, and
then he sticks you?


201
0:9:53,84 --> 0:9:54,42
He did that to me.


202
0:9:54,42 --> 0:9:55,2
Just now.


203
0:9:55,2 --> 0:9:56,45
And it worked.


204
0:9:56,45 --> 0:11:56,45
