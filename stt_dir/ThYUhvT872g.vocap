###6 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to CNN STUDENT NEWS on this Tuesday, December 18th and thank
###16 you for joining us. I`m Carl Azuz. Today`s show begins in Connecticut.
###20 The community of Newtown, Connecticut is in mourning after a massacre at an elementary
###26 school. Our complete coverage of the story is in Monday`s show at cnnstudentnews.com.
###31 As police expand their investigation into what led to the tragedy, people in Newtown
###36 are banding together and they are getting support from across the country. They are
###41 holding memorials and vigils for the victims. Mourners are saying prayers for the victims,
###45 their families and their community. The U.S. Postal Service has set up a place where people
###49 can mail their condolences and messages of support to Newtown. If you are interested
###54 in that, the address is "Message of Condolence", it`s P.O. Box 3700, Newtown, Connecticut,
###62 06470.
###64 When President Obama spoke at a high school there on Sunday night, he questioned whether
###68 Americans were doing enough to bring this kind of violence to an end.
###71 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###72 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Can we truly say as a nation that
###76 we are meeting our obligations? Can we honestly say that we are doing enough to keep our children,
###89 all of them safe from harm? Can we claim as a nation that we are altogether there, letting
###101 them know that they are loved and teaching them to love in return? Can we say that we
###107 are truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to
###115 live out their lives in happiness and with purpose? I`ve been reflecting on this the
###124 last few days. And if we are honest with ourselves, the answer is no. We are not doing enough.
###131 And we all have to change.
###134 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###135 AZUZ: All right, but how? There are a lot of people out there in the media, from leaders
###140 and journalists to musicians and actors sharing their theories on what led to this and how
###145 to prevent it. We`d like to hear from you, what are your ideas on how the nation can
###150 change to keep kids safer? Please, share your thoughts and only your first names on our
###155 blog at cnnstudentnews.com
###158 Some of the people who live in Newtown are sharing their thoughts on this, they are trying
###161 to turn some of the attention that`s focused on them to the issues that they believe should
###165 be addressed to prevent this from happening somewhere else. CNN`s Kyung Lah reports on
###170 what some citizens of Newtown are saying.
###172 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###172 KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You can hear their frustration.
###175 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At the point you buy body armor, shouldn`t the FBI be at your door?
###179 LAH: These are questions asked before after Columbine and Virginia Tech and again, this
###184 year, in places like Aurora, Colorado and Clackamas, Oregon. This time, it`s this Newtown
###190 residents who knew the children and teachers killed at Sandy Hook.
###193 CRAIG MITTLEMAN, NEWTOWN RESIDENT: We have the benefit and the misfortunate of being
###197 on the national stage right now. This is a real opportunity for us to make a statement.
###202 LAH: They have no political power in this room, just grief. Grief channeled into a will
###207 to bring change.
###207 LEE SHULL, NEWTOWN RESIDENT: I think we need to talk about what`s reasonable. I don`t think
###211 it`s reasonable for assault weapons in any way in our society except for the military
###215 or police.
###215 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mental illness, shove it underneath the rug. We can`t do that anymore.
###219 MARY SIRECI, NEWTOWN RESIDENT: We do something now and leave here with some proactive things,
###225 some action.
###226 LAH: What you are looking at is the birth of a grassroots effort from a town in pain.
###231 They have built a Facebook page calling themselves Newtown United. They admit they don`t know
###236 what they are doing, just that they have to do something.
###239 BILL TOOMEY, NEWTOWN RESIDENT: If this is a trigger point, or a tipping point for us
###243 and our elected officials to actually start talking to each other in a way that`s respectful
###248 and results in real change that would be huge.
###251 LAH: The goal of Newtown United to prevent another town from suffering what this one
###255 is enduring will not go unheated. Kyung Lah, CNN, Newtown, Connecticut.
###262 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###263 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me. I used to be part of the Ottoman Empire, you`ll
###271 find me between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, my largest city is Istanbul, but my capital
###278 is Ankara.
###280 I`m Turkey, and I bridge countries in Europe and the Middle East.
###287 (END VIDE CLIP)
###289 AZUZ: That bridge between East and West makes Turkey an important country in international
###294 issues. You see in this map how one of its border countries is Syria, well, some of the
###299 weapons fired in Syria` civil war have hit locations in Turkey. Turkey is a member of
###304 NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. That makes it an ally of 27 other countries
###310 including the U.S. And Germany. So, those two nations are sending Patriot missiles to
###314 Turkey to help protect it from the violence in Syria. This is a file photo of a Patriot
###320 missile launcher, one thing these missiles can do is intercept and destroy other missiles,
###325 and that`s the idea here. If weapons used in Syria` civil war come close to Turkey,
###330 the Patriots could intercept them and help keep Turkish citizens safe.
###334 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###335 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s time for the "Shoutout." What is the biggest source of U.S. Government
###341 revenue? If you think you know it then shout it out. Is it taxes, interest on loans, land
###348 leasing or borrowing? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###356 Taxes on citizens and businesses account for most of the government`s revenue. That`s your
###363 answer and that`s your "Shoutout."
###365 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###367 AZUZ: That`s why the debate over taxes, who gets taxed and by how much is so important
###372 to the U.S. Government`s debate over the upcoming fiscal cliff. It`s a series of tax increases
###378 in government`s spending cuts that will automatically happen in January. A lot of experts agree
###382 it would be a bad thing for the U.S. Economy, and it can only be avoided if Congress and
###388 the president can agree on another way to address the nation`s massive debt. One way
###393 to do that is by reducing government spending, but that`s is easier said than done. Tom Foreman
###398 has an excellent illustration of "why".
###400 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###401 TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What you are looking at in this room, is everything the
###404 federal government spends money on, and that score board back there shows you the problem.
###409 Last year we spent $3.6 trillion on all this stuff, but we only took in $2.3 trillion in
###416 taxes or revenue. Now, Democrats tend to like to talk more in these talks about the revenue
###421 side of the equation. They say if we can find the way to gin up more taxes, lean on the
###425 rich harder, that`s how we can deal with this deficit. But Republicans while agreeing we
###430 may need more revenue want to talk a lot more about all this stuff, and whether or not they
###434 can cut some things down.
###436 One of the first things you may notice is that not all spending is equal. You could
###440 have dramatic cuts in things like Homeland Security, the Energy Department and the Interior
###445 Department. If you cut those programs out entirely, yeah, you`d save $80 billion, but
###449 that`s only a small fraction of the deficit. That`s why the talk is largely about this
###455 back row, where the big ticket items reside, such as Social Security, health and human
###460 services, home to Medicare and Medicaid and defense. Each one of these accounts for more
###466 than $700 billion in spending, so yeah, if you could find a way to somehow chop about
###472 25 percent out of each program here, you`d get real savings, about half trillion dollars.
###477 But doing that would be unbelievably tough, the simple truth is some of them are protected
###482 from cuts. Social Security is something that Democrats and Republicans alike have been
###486 very afraid to go after. The social programs are very much protected by Democrats and the
###491 Republicans are equally protective of Defense. That`s why these talks are so tough. The simple
###497 truth is, every program in this room has constituents who will fight tooth and nail to hold on to
###504 the funding.
###505 What there is this, if no deal is struck and the fiscal cliff comes, than $600 billion
###512 in automatic tax increases and spending cuts will kick in, that could effect a lot of programs
###517 in this room and that will absolutely leave an awful lot of voters, Democratic and Republican
###523 unhappy.
###524 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###526 AZUZ: Before we go today, it`s a Christmas mystery:
###528 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###530 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We found it at 5 a.m, in the morning, and it glows, it lights up.
###533 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###534 AZUZ: Yeah, it does. And it mysteriously showed up in someone`s front yard in a Missouri community.
###541 This 30-foot Santa came with instructions. Enjoy it or at least leave it up there for
###546 24 hours, then schlep the statuesque Santa in a slay or maybe more realistically a pickup
###552 truck over to the house of someone else with children. Kids love it. Well, why shouldn`t
###558 they? It`s santastic! And not keeping the mystery alive would be positively deflating.
###563 We hope you enjoy the rest of your day and you`ll join us again tomorrow on CNN STUDENT
###567 NEWS.
