0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:9,33



2
0:0:9,33 --> 0:0:10,85
TRAVIS BROWNE: Before, I was
little more superstitious


3
0:0:10,85 --> 0:0:15,5
about stuff, and I'd be like,
OK, well, everything has to be


4
0:0:15,5 --> 0:0:16,95
like just perfect.


5
0:0:16,95 --> 0:0:18,86
And I still kind of am.


6
0:0:18,86 --> 0:0:22,49
It's like there are sometimes
that if something's happening,


7
0:0:22,49 --> 0:0:24,95
I get a little irritated
about something.


8
0:0:24,95 --> 0:0:28,23
But for the most part, I learned
how to relax and just


9
0:0:28,23 --> 0:0:30,15
go with the flow and know that,
at the end of the day,


10
0:0:30,15 --> 0:0:33,6
all the work that I've done
was put in my camp.


11
0:0:33,6 --> 0:0:36,87
And the result will be the
result no matter what it is.


12
0:0:36,87 --> 0:0:39,612
-This is what we do and
why we do it, baby.


13
0:0:39,612 --> 0:0:41,71
No doubt, nobody does
it any better.


14
0:0:41,71 --> 0:0:43,3
This is your night,
your fight.


15
0:0:43,3 --> 0:0:44,9
You get it right, son.


16
0:0:44,9 --> 0:0:48,35
All that hard work, all that
time in the gym, now it's time


17
0:0:48,35 --> 0:0:49,6
to get it done.


18
0:0:49,6 --> 0:1:16,615



19
0:1:16,615 --> 0:1:19,597
-When you get over there today,
please, please make


20
0:1:19,597 --> 0:1:22,579
sure when you go up in front
of the commission that you


21
0:1:22,579 --> 0:1:26,58
identify specifically the people
that you want on your


22
0:1:26,58 --> 0:1:28,46
corner shoot tomorrow.


23
0:1:28,46 --> 0:1:29,4
Travis Browne.


24
0:1:29,4 --> 0:1:30,6
TRAVIS BROWNE: Yep.


25
0:1:30,6 --> 0:1:34,6
The thing about fighting, for
two months, we're doing


26
0:1:34,6 --> 0:1:35,83
everything for ourselves.


27
0:1:35,83 --> 0:1:37,91
Like, nobody else is going to
get in that damn cage with us.


28
0:1:37,91 --> 0:1:39,29
You know?


29
0:1:39,29 --> 0:1:42,9
So for two months straight
before a fight, we are some of


30
0:1:42,9 --> 0:1:44,5
most selfish people out there.


31
0:1:44,5 --> 0:1:46,15
And we have every right to be.


32
0:1:46,15 --> 0:1:49,28
So after the fights or even
leading up to the fights--


33
0:1:49,28 --> 0:1:51,39
it gets even that much
more intense


34
0:1:51,39 --> 0:1:52,17
leading up to the fight.


35
0:1:52,17 --> 0:1:56,44
I fought Chad in April, and I
went back a week later to


36
0:1:56,44 --> 0:1:59,81
train for 146 just
as an alternate.


37
0:1:59,81 --> 0:2:1,93
And then I went back two weeks
later to train for my fight


38
0:2:1,93 --> 0:2:3,18
with Ben Rothwell.


39
0:2:3,18 --> 0:2:7,12
That got cut a week
before the fight.


40
0:2:7,12 --> 0:2:10,9
And then I went home for two
weeks and then came back and


41
0:2:10,9 --> 0:2:11,69
did another seven week
camp for this fight.


42
0:2:11,69 --> 0:2:15,395
So it was like rough, bro.


43
0:2:15,395 --> 0:2:17,5
-What have you guys been
chatting about so far?


44
0:2:17,5 --> 0:2:18,74
They're from New York.


45
0:2:18,74 --> 0:2:21,284
You've got a fight tomorrow.


46
0:2:21,284 --> 0:2:22,8
TRAVIS BROWNE: Yeah, we've
got a fight tomorrow.


47
0:2:22,8 --> 0:2:23,63
You guys came in.


48
0:2:23,63 --> 0:2:24,91
-I saw Big Foot in the hotel.


49
0:2:24,91 --> 0:2:25,782
He looked a little
scared actually.


50
0:2:25,782 --> 0:2:26,22
TRAVIS BROWNE: Oh, did you?


51
0:2:26,22 --> 0:2:27,24
-He did, yeah.


52
0:2:27,24 --> 0:2:28,725
-He didn't really look
as big as I expected.


53
0:2:28,725 --> 0:2:30,26
You're actually a lot taller.


54
0:2:30,26 --> 0:2:30,62
TRAVIS BROWNE: Oh, yeah.


55
0:2:30,62 --> 0:2:31,34
I'm a lot taller.


56
0:2:31,34 --> 0:2:33,12
But he's a big dude.


57
0:2:33,12 --> 0:2:33,95
Did you shake his hand?


58
0:2:33,95 --> 0:2:34,42
-No.


59
0:2:34,42 --> 0:2:37,13
TRAVIS BROWNE: His hands
are like this big.


60
0:2:37,13 --> 0:2:41,3



61
0:2:41,3 --> 0:2:43,83
With Silva, there's little
things that he does that we


62
0:2:43,83 --> 0:2:45,55
just have to be careful about.


63
0:2:45,55 --> 0:2:49,5
In the long run, I'm just
training to train.


64
0:2:49,5 --> 0:2:52,82
I'm just training to fight
like I'm going to fight.


65
0:2:52,82 --> 0:2:57,5
My style isn't going to change
regardless who it is.


66
0:2:57,5 --> 0:2:59,11
I'm one of the taller guys
in the division.


67
0:2:59,11 --> 0:3:0,77
I have one of the
longer reaches.


68
0:3:0,77 --> 0:3:3,51
So I'm just going to use that
in every single fight I can.


69
0:3:3,51 --> 0:3:8,94
-Travis Hapa Browne versus
Antonio Big Foot Silva.


70
0:3:8,94 --> 0:3:20,37
246 for Travis Browne.


71
0:3:20,37 --> 0:3:23,3
TRAVIS BROWNE: I think usually
the guys that feel like they


72
0:3:23,3 --> 0:3:26,92
have to try and intimidate
somebody are usually the ones


73
0:3:26,92 --> 0:3:29,9
that feel like they have
something to make up for.


74
0:3:29,9 --> 0:3:30,99
You know?


75
0:3:30,99 --> 0:3:33,73
I go there.


76
0:3:33,73 --> 0:3:38,53
I do my stare down, and I'm good
with just walking away.


77
0:3:38,53 --> 0:3:41,15
But if somebody wants to get
in there and get in my face


78
0:3:41,15 --> 0:3:45,24
and try to posture on me to
make me back down, they're


79
0:3:45,24 --> 0:3:46,56
going to get it right back.


80
0:3:46,56 --> 0:3:48,5
And that's what happened
today.


81
0:3:48,5 --> 0:3:51,68
He got where we are like
touching noses and all this


82
0:3:51,68 --> 0:3:52,64
kind of stuff.


83
0:3:52,64 --> 0:3:53,68
And Dana had to come in.


84
0:3:53,68 --> 0:3:56,36
And at that point, I'm not
going to back down.


85
0:3:56,36 --> 0:3:59,15
If you're going to bring it up
like that, you better be able


86
0:3:59,15 --> 0:4:0,4
to back it up the next day.


87
0:4:0,4 --> 0:4:3,9



88
0:4:3,9 --> 0:4:4,3
-Travis, can I get
your autograph?


89
0:4:4,3 --> 0:4:4,186
TRAVIS BROWNE: Yeah.


90
0:4:4,186 --> 0:4:5,44
For sure, bud.


91
0:4:5,44 --> 0:4:7,19
-Thanks, dude.


92
0:4:7,19 --> 0:4:13,712
[CHATTERING]


93
0:4:13,712 --> 0:4:14,575
-Thanks, man.


94
0:4:14,575 --> 0:4:15,73
Can I get a picture
with you too, bro?


95
0:4:15,73 --> 0:4:16,98
TRAVIS BROWNE: Yeah.


96
0:4:16,98 --> 0:4:20,7



97
0:4:20,7 --> 0:4:20,81
-Good luck, dude.


98
0:4:20,81 --> 0:4:22,6
TRAVIS BROWNE: Thanks, man.


99
0:4:22,6 --> 0:4:23,95



100
0:4:23,95 --> 0:4:27,1
Fans coming up to you wanting to
take your picture, or have


101
0:4:27,1 --> 0:4:30,22
an autograph, or just talk for
a little bit or something is,


102
0:4:30,22 --> 0:4:32,29
for me, that means I'm
doing my job right.


103
0:4:32,29 --> 0:4:34,15
It means that they're interested
in me as a fighter,


104
0:4:34,15 --> 0:4:36,81
and they're excited
to watch me fight.


105
0:4:36,81 --> 0:4:39,82
That's why they bought the
ticket, to go and spend the


106
0:4:39,82 --> 0:4:43,53
night there waiting for me to
get into the cage and knock


107
0:4:43,53 --> 0:4:45,32
somebody out.


108
0:4:45,32 --> 0:4:50,12
Today during the stare down,
my opponent kind of got a


109
0:4:50,12 --> 0:4:51,63
little close.


110
0:4:51,63 --> 0:4:53,89
And he wanted to keep
an eye on me.


111
0:4:53,89 --> 0:4:57,99
So I was just showing him that
he's got a fight tomorrow.


112
0:4:57,99 --> 0:4:58,78
You can't look away, you know?


113
0:4:58,78 --> 0:5:0,34
You can't submit like that.


114
0:5:0,34 --> 0:5:1,8
So he knows.


115
0:5:1,8 --> 0:5:3,22
He knows what's coming
down tomorrow.


116
0:5:3,22 --> 0:5:5,9
And I look forward to it.


117
0:5:5,9 --> 0:5:19,6



118
0:5:19,6 --> 0:5:20,82
I try to eat these pretty
plain, even


119
0:5:20,82 --> 0:5:22,59
though this is curry.


120
0:5:22,59 --> 0:5:24,57
It's still eight hours
before my fight.


121
0:5:24,57 --> 0:5:30,74
So my next meal will
be pretty bland.


122
0:5:30,74 --> 0:5:33,66
I just try to eat stuff
that gives me energy.


123
0:5:33,66 --> 0:5:36,78
The day of my fight, in the
morning I'll be waking up.


124
0:5:36,78 --> 0:5:40,35
And I'll just be warming up with
my coach and really just


125
0:5:40,35 --> 0:5:42,44
going over last minute
game plan things.


126
0:5:42,44 --> 0:5:45,35
And just break a sweat, hitting
pads, doing a little


127
0:5:45,35 --> 0:5:49,77
bit of wrestling, staying
focused on our game plan.


128
0:5:49,77 --> 0:5:52,69
That way when I'm in the cage,
it's just second nature.


129
0:5:52,69 --> 0:5:53,6
I don't have to think
about it.


130
0:5:53,6 --> 0:5:54,7
It just happens.


131
0:5:54,7 --> 0:5:58,95
It helps you get over that first
hump in the day where


132
0:5:58,95 --> 0:6:1,25
you might feel a little
sluggish, a little slow, or


133
0:6:1,25 --> 0:6:2,42
something like that.


134
0:6:2,42 --> 0:6:5,22
That way when you're warming up
right before you walk out


135
0:6:5,22 --> 0:6:7,95
for your fight, you're already
on your second wind.


136
0:6:7,95 --> 0:6:9,25
You're like, OK, I'm
ready to go.


137
0:6:9,25 --> 0:6:10,55
This is it.


138
0:6:10,55 --> 0:6:12,7
There's nothing holding
me back.


139
0:6:12,7 --> 0:6:14,77
And you're walking into that
arena knowing that you're


140
0:6:14,77 --> 0:6:16,3
ready to fight.


141
0:6:16,3 --> 0:6:17,77
-Mr. Browne, what's up, baby?


142
0:6:17,77 --> 0:6:19,94
TRAVIS BROWNE: What's up?


143
0:6:19,94 --> 0:6:22,56
-All the way down on
the end, baby.


144
0:6:22,56 --> 0:6:24,35
All the way down on the end.


145
0:6:24,35 --> 0:6:26,5
TRAVIS BROWNE: Coach, that
spin kick's coming nasty.


146
0:6:26,5 --> 0:6:27,476
-Is it?


147
0:6:27,476 --> 0:6:28,726
TRAVIS BROWNE: Yeah.


148
0:6:28,726 --> 0:6:30,9



149
0:6:30,9 --> 0:6:36,55
With coach Jackson and coach
Wink has really helped me in a


150
0:6:36,55 --> 0:6:39,47
couple different ways.


151
0:6:39,47 --> 0:6:43,3
They have the perfect yin
and yang tactics, I


152
0:6:43,3 --> 0:6:45,9
guess you could say.


153
0:6:45,9 --> 0:6:47,15
But really it's the environment
that they've


154
0:6:47,15 --> 0:6:51,72
created in the gym also with my
training partners and the


155
0:6:51,72 --> 0:6:54,1
environment where the gym is.


156
0:6:54,1 --> 0:6:56,15
Definitely my striking has
come around a lot.


157
0:6:56,15 --> 0:6:57,82
I've really learned what
my body can do.


158
0:6:57,82 --> 0:7:0,17
And I think coach Wink has had
a lot to do with that.


159
0:7:0,17 --> 0:7:1,16
He's like, oh, you like that?


160
0:7:1,16 --> 0:7:1,995
Yeah, let's work it.


161
0:7:1,995 --> 0:7:6,34
Let's make it a weapon and
go out and perform and


162
0:7:6,34 --> 0:7:7,3
do what I do best.


163
0:7:7,3 --> 0:7:9,743
And I already have the mentality
that I'm going to go


164
0:7:9,743 --> 0:7:12,43
in that cage, and I'm going to
go in that cage to hurt you.


165
0:7:12,43 --> 0:7:14,43
I'm not your friend.


166
0:7:14,43 --> 0:7:16,29
I'm not your family.


167
0:7:16,29 --> 0:7:20,83
And even if I was, if you're in
that cage with me on flight


168
0:7:20,83 --> 0:7:23,8
day, I'm still going
to try to hurt you.


169
0:7:23,8 --> 0:7:24,67
Because you're going to try to
do the same thing to me.


170
0:7:24,67 --> 0:7:53,11



171
0:7:53,11 --> 0:7:59,131

[FIGHT COMMENTARY]


173
0:8:25,578 --> 0:8:32,564
-Declaring the winner by TKO
Antonio Big Foot Silva.


174
0:8:32,564 --> 0:9:0,9



175
0:9:0,9 --> 0:9:2,17
TRAVIS BROWNE: At this point
it just motivates me.


176
0:9:2,17 --> 0:9:4,613
It pisses me off that somebody
like that is going to make a


177
0:9:4,613 --> 0:9:6,17
name off me.


178
0:9:6,17 --> 0:9:7,81
He's my first defeat.


179
0:9:7,81 --> 0:9:16,19
And being cordial and all that
kind of shit put aside, that


180
0:9:16,19 --> 0:9:18,78
mother fucker doesn't beat
me on my worst day.


181
0:9:18,78 --> 0:9:21,34
I got injured in the fight.


182
0:9:21,34 --> 0:9:25,41
And I wouldn't mind that being
my first fight back.


183
0:9:25,41 --> 0:9:27,71
I want that fight back,
everybody knows it.


184
0:9:27,71 --> 0:9:30,41



185
0:9:30,41 --> 0:9:34,12
And all it's going to do is
motivate the fuck out of me.


186
0:9:34,12 --> 0:9:37,19
If I wasn't motivated
before, I am now.


187
0:9:37,19 --> 0:9:39,95
My whole thing is that if he
was better than me today, I


188
0:9:39,95 --> 0:9:40,916
wouldn't have a problem
with it.


189
0:9:40,916 --> 0:9:44,7
But the fact that I got injured
and I was hurt in the


190
0:9:44,7 --> 0:9:46,3
first fucking 30 seconds
of the fight, just


191
0:9:46,3 --> 0:9:47,98
fucking pisses me off.


192
0:9:47,98 --> 0:9:52,885
And for him to make a staple in
his career off of my name,


193
0:9:52,885 --> 0:9:54,155
makes it even worse.
