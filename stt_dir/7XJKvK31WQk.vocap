###6 CARL AZUZ, HOST: Hi, I`m Carl Azuz.
###14 And today we`re going to one-up Phineas Fogg. Instead of 80 days, we`re going around the
###18 world in 80 seconds for some global headlines at the start of today`s show.
###24 Our first stop is in Syria, where a civil war is driving hundreds of thousands of people
###29 out of the country. According to estimates from the United Nations, more than half a
###33 million Syrian refugees have crossed over the border. They`re looking for safety. They`re
###38 also looking for warmth. And with predictions for a harsh winter, that could be hard to
###43 find.
###43 Next, we`re heading to China, where some newspaper journalists are protesting against the government.
###48 They`ve accused officials of censorship and restricting freedom of the press. Local government
###53 officials aren`t commenting about the situation. The people you see here are supporting the
###58 journalists laying flowers down at the newspaper`s headquarters.
###61 Now, we`re going to go to Australia, where intense heat and strong winds are fueling
###66 the flames of two wildfires. This is happening on the island of the Tasmania. The first have
###71 destroyed more than 100 homes, but as of late Sunday night, officials said there hadn`t
###77 been any deaths reported, although they were looking into reports about potentially missing
###81 people.
###83 Last stop on our global tour, Alaska, where an oil rig was a little closer to shore than
###88 you might expect -- right up on it. This Royal Dutch Shell rig ran aground last week. It
###94 happened while it was being towed back to its winter home. There could be up to 150,000
###99 gallons of diesel on board, but observers are saying there are no signs that any of
###104 it is leaking out.
###106 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s Shout Out goes out to Mr. Apfeld`s social studies classes
###112 at All Saint`s Catholic School in Fort Worth, Texas.
###116 The U.S. Defense secretary`s office is located in what building?
###120 Here we go now.
###121 Is it at the U.S. Capitol, Pentagon, White House or Fort Knox?
###126 You`ve got 30 seconds. Go.
###132 The Defense Department`s headquarters is in the Pentagon, one of the world`s largest office
###139 buildings.
###139 That`s your answer and that`s your Shout Out.
###144 AZUZ: There might be a new person behind that desk in the Pentagon soon. On Monday, President
###149 Obama announced his nominee to be the next secretary of Defense, former Senator Chuck
###155 Hagel. He`s a Republican who served 12 years in the U.S. Senate and he`s also a veteran
###160 who fought in the Vietnam War. If he`s confirmed as the next Defense secretary, he`ll be the
###165 first enlisted soldier to eventually hold that office. Hagel has made some controversial
###170 statements in the past and that could lead to some challenges during his confirmation
###175 process.
###176 Yesterday, the president also nominated John Brennan to be the next director of the CIA.
###182 Right now, Brennan is the president`s chief adviser on counter-terrorism. He worked at
###186 the CIA for 25 years, so getting the job as director could be seen as kind of a homecoming
###191 for him.
###192 And just because President Obama nominates them doesn`t mean Hagel and Brennan will get
###197 those jobs. We mentioned they have to be confirmed. And that power belongs to the U.S. Senate.
###202 There will be confirmation hearings, where senators will get to ask these nominees questions
###207 before deciding whether or not to vote for them, to approve them for the jobs.
###211 Confirming presidential nominees is one of the responsibilities that can only be done
###216 by one part of Congress or the other. For example, the House of Representatives can
###220 decide if a government official should be put on trial, but the Senate is the group
###225 that holds that trial.
###226 On other things, obviously, the House and Senate work together, like coming up with
###230 laws.
###231 Yesterday, Athena Jones looked at the issue of gun control.
###234 Today, she`s putting the focus on another subject that could be a priority for the new
###238 Congress -- immigration reform.
###240 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###240 ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): What might comprehensive legislation look
###243 like?
###243 The president says it should include measures to beef up border security, punish companies
###248 that purposely hire undocumented workers and give the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants
###254 here a way to obtain legal status.
###257 Groups that want to restrict immigration are skeptical.
###259 DAN STEIN, FEDERATION FOR AMERICAN IMMIGRATION REFORM: The president himself has said he
###261 doesn`t think these laws are enforceable. How -- how on earth is Congress ever going
###266 to be convinced to pass a package of -- of the kind he`s talking about when no guarantees
###270 can be made to the general public that the laws will be respected?
###272 JONES: Doubts that could signal a long road ahead for this legislative push.
###277 JOHN GRAMLICH, "CQ ROLL CALL": Right now, what`s interesting on immigration is that
###280 everyone is talking the talk, and that includes Democrats and Republicans. But, again, there`s
###284 a big difference between talking the talk and walking the walk on policy.
###286 JONES (on camera): A big question is whether the parties can agree on how to approach this
###290 immigration issue.
###291 Should it be one big bill, which many Democrats are pushing?
###295 Or several smaller ones, which many Republicans favor, because they say this issue is so complex?
###301 Athena Jones, CNN, Washington.
###303 (END VIDEO TAPE)
###305 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can ID me. I`m an annual celebration that includes parties
###312 and parades. I start on the 12th day after Christmas and I end on Mardi Gras.
###318 My biggest U.S. celebration is in New Orleans. I`m Carnival and I occur right before the
###328 season of Lent.
###330 (END VIDEO TAPE)
###332 AZUZ: Carnival season is on in New Orleans and it runs through Fat Tuesday. One artist
###337 is honoring the city by using items that are associated with the celebration.
###342 This is a mosaic. It`s a type of art that uses small items to form a picture or a pattern.
###347 In this case, the artist and his helpers are using recycled Mardi Gras beads. They`re recreating
###352 a cityscape of New Orleans. And when they`re finished, the 42-foot wide work of art is
###358 expected to set a new record. All it takes is one and a half million beads, some very
###363 precise placements and a whole lot of patience.
###367 While Carnival brings huge crowds to New Orleans, a different event brought tens of thousands
###371 of people right here to Atlanta, Georgia last week. It`s the Passion Conference, a gathering
###376 of young Christians who are committed to changing the world, in part by taking on the issue
###381 of human slavery.
###382 Jim Clancy looks at how the movement is gaining momentum.
###385 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###385 JIM CLANCY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: (voice-over): More than 60,000 young Christians from around
###390 the country and around the world held candles aloft in the frosty air. Their own faces shine
###396 back at them from a massive cube set up outside the Georgia Dome -- faces of those who have
###402 pledged to light up the world and put an end to human trafficking in their lifetimes.
###409 BRYSON VOGELTANZ, PASSION 2013: Slavery is trapped in dark places all over the world.
###417 It`s trapped here in Atlanta in the shadows. It`s in the shadows in Mumbai, India. It`s
###422 in the shadows in Cambodia. It`s in the shadows around the world in brothels and factories.
###427 These 60,000 students, they`re going to shine a light on slavery.
###432 CLANCY: For many, this is a journey of the Christian faith, one that brings them here
###437 to the Passion Conference to worship, pray and learn. For the past two years, they`ve
###441 been focusing on the unholy scourge of sexual slavery and forced labor, the 27 million victims,
###449 the billions of dollars churned out by robbing men, women and children of their freedom.
###455 These young men and women are determined to change that.
###457 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The truth is spoken here. And where truth is spoken, things change.
###461 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`re going to raise the awareness. We`re going to fight for those
###463 that ho -- don`t have a voice. And we`re just going to tell people about this. And we`re
###467 going to let this world know that there`s an issue and we`re not OK with it.
###469 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To just know that this is out there and like it - - it just opened
###472 my eyes to all this. Like I had no idea this was really going on. And then like I just
###477 want to be able to help as much as I can.
###479 VOGELTANZ: This is about students starting a journey of justice, that their entire lives
###484 would count for justice, their entire lives would count for freedom. And that`s happening
###488 here.
###488 CLANCY: Last year, the event raised $3.5 million. With 20,000 more participants this year, tablet
###495 computers were used to help speed the donation process.
###499 Some of the money comes from the students themselves. More was raised in their communities.
###503 It will be used to help raise awareness, rescue victims and help them restore their lives.
###510 (END VIDEO TAPE)
###511 AZUZ: Describe the civil rights leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner in just one word.
###516 It`s a challenge, but we know you`re up for it. Martin Luther King Day is coming up soon.
###519 We want you to send in iReports describing Dr. King in just one word. The deadline is
###524 January 15th, so you`ve got one week to do it and one place to find all the detail, CNNStudentNews.com.
###530 All right, we`re going to wrap things up today in the skies over the California coast. It`s
###535 a bird, it`s a plane, it`s Super Man?
###537 It certainly looks like the comic book character. It turns out this souped up soups is a remote-controlled
###543 flier. And this YouTube video has made him an online sensation.
###546 Not exactly the man of steel. He`s more like the man of lightweight foam. Of course, this
###552 cape-fur happened in Cal-Al-Fornia. We just wish that it happened in a city named Clark,
###556 but I guess you Kent get everything you want. These puns are just super bad.
###559 We`re going to go before we get carried up, up and away.
###562 One real quick thing. We have a new blog up on our home page.
###565 One week into the new year, how are your resolutions holding up?
###568 Tell us at CNNStudentNews.com.
###569 And we`ll see you right back here again tomorrow.
