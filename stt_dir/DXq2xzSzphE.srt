and violence--

0:0:20,33 --> 0:0:25,575
these properties reside in the
soul, along with God and love


4
0:0:25,575 --> 0:0:27,185
and such things.


5
0:0:27,185 --> 0:0:29,36
So when people say that violence
followed my brothers


6
0:0:29,36 --> 0:0:36,99
all their lives, I am inclined
to disagree.


7
0:0:36,99 --> 0:0:38,9
It was always there--

-We are survivors.


11
0:0:46,47 --> 0:0:47,72
We control the fear.


12
0:0:47,72 --> 0:0:51,43



13
0:0:51,43 --> 0:1:0,27
And without the fear, we are
all as good as dead.

15
0:1:3,54 --> 0:1:4,585
-This here's the new deputy.


16
0:1:4,585 --> 0:1:6,8
He wants to work it
out so everybody

gets to do some business.

-I'm going to make your life
real difficult from now on if

0:1:10,58 --> 0:1:12,19
you don't toe the line,
country boy.

21
0:1:14,705 --> 0:1:18,84
-Don't you ever touch
me again.


22
0:1:18,84 --> 0:1:20,71
-There's a feeling around
these parts that these

Do you have any idea what a
Thompson submachine gun does


27

31
0:1:44,28 --> 0:1:44,875
-That's impressive.


32
0:1:44,875 --> 0:1:46,39
-You want more of this stuff?


33
0:1:46,39 --> 0:1:48,652
-As much as you can bring me.


34
0:1:48,652 --> 0:1:50,2
-You're an outlaw, Jack.


35
0:1:50,2 --> 0:1:50,345
-No.


36
0:1:50,345 --> 0:1:52,92
It's just a matter
of perspective.


37
0:1:52,92 --> 0:1:54,89
-This is a war they's
a-waging.


38
0:1:54,89 --> 0:1:56,435
You ain't going to survive.


39
0:1:56,435 --> 0:1:57,71
-I'm a Bondurant.

Forrest, once said, nothing
