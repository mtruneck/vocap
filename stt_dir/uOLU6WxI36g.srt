Hey Food Tubers.
I'm Tim Shieff, athlete, World Free Running


2
0:0:8,799 --> 0:0:13,39
Champion and also a vegan. After a workout
a lot of people reach for a protein shake,


3
0:0:13,39 --> 0:0:16,6
but I realised that what you need to replace
is the carbs. So I came up with an all natural,


4
0:0:16,6 --> 0:0:22,5
high carb smootie.
Check it out, it's Datorade.


5
0:0:22,5 --> 0:0:30,9
I've only been a vegan for a year, I like
tom keep things as simple as possible. So


6
0:0:30,9 --> 0:0:33,649
I chose the fruit with the highest carbs.
Bananas and dates.


7
0:0:33,649 --> 0:0:37,93
Start things off, bananas. I want four of
these. That's when you want to be blending


8
0:0:37,93 --> 0:0:44,12
them up when they're spotty, nice and ripe.
Peel them, from the bottom. Bananas are 93%


9
0:0:44,12 --> 0:0:50,64
carbs, 3% fat, 4% protein so you're getting
some protein in there as well. It really doesn't


10
0:0:50,64 --> 0:0:53,1
matter if they're bruised, they're getting
blended up anyway.


11
0:0:53,1 --> 0:0:58,26
Natural sugars you've for in the banana which
is helping to replace the glycogen you need


12
0:0:58,26 --> 0:1:1,559
to replace in your body after a workout.
Another thing I like to do is scrape from


13
0:1:1,559 --> 0:1:5,19
the peel. You wouldn't want to eat that if
you're eating from the banana, but blending


14
0:1:5,19 --> 0:1:8,909
it into a smoothie it really doesn't matter.
I came up with these smoothie recipes. Just


15
0:1:8,909 --> 0:1:10,939
have fun with whole foods and see what you
like.


16
0:1:10,939 --> 0:1:15,249
I've got four bananas in there, now you want
to double up with the dates. I go 8 dates,


17
0:1:15,249 --> 0:1:20,829
two for every banana.
Medjool are my favourite, look how gooey that


18
0:1:20,829 --> 0:1:25,369
is. It's like fudge caramel. You want to make
sure there's no stone inside.


19
0:1:25,369 --> 0:1:31,189
These ones have already been de stoned. Put
it in. These have really dense calories. That's


20
0:1:31,189 --> 0:1:34,929
2,3,4,5,6,7,8.
I really enjoy cinnamon. I add it to almost


21
0:1:34,929 --> 0:1:40,31
everything I have, so one spoon of that. Also
some ginger, gives it that nice little after


22
0:1:40,31 --> 0:1:45,13
kick then about one litre of water.
Keeps you hydrated, which you really need


23
0:1:45,13 --> 0:1:47,74
to do as you are going throughout \the day.
It;s important.


24
0:1:47,74 --> 0:1:51,179
If you're going all out and don't mind a bit
of fat in there, you can use almond milk to


25
0:1:51,179 --> 0:1:54,909
make it a bit creamier. You can put other
things. If you want to put a squeeze of lemon,


26
0:1:54,909 --> 0:1:56,88
it's all up to you.
It's whatever you like, whatever you enjoy.


27
0:1:56,88 --> 0:1:59,689
Whatever you know is good for your body you
can mix it in there as well. You might not


28
0:1:59,689 --> 0:2:10,91
even taste it so that's fine.
Let's whizz it up.


29
0:2:10,91 --> 0:2:26,41
Alright, here it is. One big, fat datorade
smoothie. I don't like to blend it too fine.


30
0:2:26,41 --> 0:2:31,54
Because it's nice to have a bit of dates to
chew on as your drinking it, i think it's


31
0:2:31,54 --> 0:2:35,17
important.
Banana and dates makes a nice caramel liquid


32
0:2:35,17 --> 0:2:49,1
here. Creamy like fudge drink.
That is so sweet, so good post workout.


33
0:2:49,1 --> 0:2:53,73
So that's it, real simple, real delicious
being vegan can be so sweet when you have


34
0:2:53,73 --> 0:2:56,62
datorade.
