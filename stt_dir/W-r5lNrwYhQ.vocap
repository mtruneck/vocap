###10 CHRIS ROACH: I see it taking a different image than lately,
###13 kind of more skateboard influenced.
###15 People are going to start doing some shit.
###18 I think for sure that people were milking snowboarding
###20 because snowboarding is fucking easy, and they were
###22 making money off of nothing doing nothing.
###25 And I think it was starting to show.
###26 And those people that got cut for that shouldn't have been
###29 making money anyway, you know?
###31 
###34 My main influence in snowboarding was
###36 probably Mike Ranquet.
###39 I met Mike.
###40 Once I met Mike, we had the same kind of backgrounds.
###43 And we felt the same way about snowboarding.
###47 We didn't take it as seriously as a lot of the
###49 other people did.
###49 We didn't care about contests.
###51 We just felt like, I guess, skateboarding on the snow.
###55 We weren't trying to win everything or whatnot.
###57 And Mike just ripped.
###59 To this day, I think Mike's one of the best
###61 snowboarders out there.
###63 He just does so many great things.
###65 MIKE RANQUET: God, I think I met Roach in Colorado
###67 on some Sims trip.
###68 And we just hit it off.
###69 We were like two peas in a pod.
###72 We had the same ideals of snowboarding.
###76 When you go to Europe in 1989, you're the only
###79 person in soft boots.
###80 It's like me and Craig Kelly and Palmer and a
###83 couple other guys.
###84 We were the only people in soft boots.
###85 Everyone was in ski boots, you know what I mean?
###88 And meeting Roach was like a breath of fresh air, because
###91 it was like he dressed proper.
###94 And he was concerned with style.
###97 Whereas other people just wanted to do method airs and
###101 get their arm up like that and stuff like that.
###103 We wanted to grab the board behind your foot or right in
###106 front of your foot, and not gay it out, you know?
###112 CHRIS ROACH: We went to the Sim's camp together, I think.
###115 And everybody was training or something.
###118 And me and Mikey were just like, dude, we can do cabs.
###122 We can go switch and do switch tricks.
###124 And I remember talking with Shaun later, he's like what
###128 the fuck dude, you guys are doing cabs now on snow
###131 and all this shit.
###131 It was just like skateboarding all over again.
###134 It's so early in snowboarding that going fakey or whatever
###138 was like a new step in snowboarding.
###141 It was just a new progression, I guess.
###143 But crazy they weren't doing it before.
###145 I'm sure they were, though, Terry and all those guys.
###147 But I think we started doing different tricks.
###150 Yeah, I think-- well, I don't know.
###151 Mikey was pretty on top of everything.
###153 He probably brought it to me first, to be honest.
###156 TODD RICHARDS: Who is my favorite snowboarder?
###158 I would say it was, back in that time, it
###161 was Roach, for sure.
###162 I mean, he was definitely--
###164 between Roach and Ranquet because those were two guys
###168 that both skated.
###169 And as far as doing tricks and things, they were grabbing and
###175 holding longer than anybody else.
###176 It was insane to see that coming from like-- you know,
###184 we weren't doing half cabs and all that stuff.
###187 We were kind of just doing this weird like kick out
###189 things off mobiles.
###190 And then I remember I was at the US Open in 1990--
###193 or no, '89.
###195 And we were riding up the gondola at Stratton.
###197 And I looked down, and it was Roach, Ranquet, Keith Wallace,
###203 Tucker Fransen, and some other random dudes that were from
###207 like Tahoe-- maybe Monte, Chris's brother, were all
###210 riding under the gondola, like just half
###213 cabbing off the knolls.
###214 And we were just like, what?
###215 We had never seen that before.
###217 And that's all we tried to do after that day, was like
###220 imitate that, you know?
###222 MIKE RANQUET: Yeah, we just started doing like out of the
###224 end of the pipe in Breckenridge and at the US
###226 Open that year.
###228 Just switch tricks basically, what is now switch tricks.
###233 But it was only me and Roach.
###234 It wasn't like a couple other people.
###236 It was like maybe Duck Boy was in there.
###238 But he was way more into like the pipe, whereas I started to
###243 look at the whole mountain.
###245 Like Roachy and I, it felt like we were the only ones
###251 carrying the flag of the skateboarding, you know?
###255 And then just having Noah then Cardiel kind of come
###258 on board, you know.
###259 It helped legitimize it in skating too because up to that
###263 point, I wouldn't even really admit I was a snowboarder
###266 among certain circles.
###268 It might come out, but then, OK, not all snowboarders are
###272 gay by birth, you know.
###274 Because at that time, I won't name names, but just goofy
###279 outfits, jester hats, and might as well have been
###283 juggling up there or something, you know?
###284 Like neon, and it was just bad, you know?
###290 CHRIS ROACH: I don't know because I
###291 wasn't really a skier.
###293 And that was isn't background.
###295 And I don't know where all the DayGlo came from.
###298 Wave Rave didn't help that situation.
###301 But it just didn't fit with me and where I was.
###305 I mean, black looked better on snow than bright yellow did.
###310 And that was more my attitude and how I felt.
###314 But I think a lot of guys make good money off wearing DayGlo.
###317 Damian did very well for himself.
###319 So whatever, that's good for him.
###322 There was plenty of guys that would wear the DayGlo, so
###325 there was no shortage of that.
###329 JP WALKER: Just his fashion at the time,
###330 too, was pretty sick.
###331 Like with those big--
###332 I don't know if they were Oakley Frogskins or something,
###335 rainbow, tan, and big bleached hair, and all
###340 grown out and stuff.
###341 And just the way he even talked, too, was so like
###345 snowboard speak, like decent pokes in the pipe.
###350 I don't know, Brushie used to talk like that, too.
###351 But I don't know, it was pretty sick, his whole
###355 everything.
###356 
###358 DAVE SEOANE: And, I don't know if you guys know this, but I
###361 think it was like Tucker Fransen and
###363 Chris Roach who actually--
###364 the traditional method airs, when you pull it out and you
###367 poke your leg way out, traditionally that was called
###371 the grasser.
###371 And that was because of Chris Roach and Tucker Fransen.
###375 The grasser.
###376 CHRIS ROACH: I coined it up here because a lot of my
###379 friends, we're all from Grass Valley here.
###381 And like I said, Shaun and Terry did the best backside
###385 airs known to man.
###386 And so we all did them mimicking those two guys.
###389 And we called it the grasser because everybody from Grass
###392 Valley had to do it like those guys.
###394 So now it's like the grasser, you know?
###397 You know who knows how to do a backside air and who doesn't.
###402 I mean, even to this day, you can see someone do a fucking
###406 method air, and I wouldn't call it a backside air or
###409 grasser either way.
###410 I mean, that's one of the good things, is if you have to
###413 explain it, then you're not doing it.
###415 So either you know you're doing it right, or you're not.
###418 You do whatever feels good.
###420 If the method feels good, so be it, and thanks for not
###422 doing the grasser.
###423 
###425 Jamie does grassers.
###428 He knows the feelings.
###430 JAMIE LYNN: You know, when I'm in Tahoe, I'm doing grassers.
###434 Any place else, I'm kicking out a method.
###438 Those guys grew up watching Kidwell at the Tahoe Donner
###441 quarter pipe kicking out killer skate methods.
###445 And they were the generation kind of just a
###447 nick before I was.
###448 So Roach had one of the sickest grassers ever.
###455 He was a big influence.
###457 He probably doesn't get as much credit as he deserves for
###459 being influential on a backside method.
###464 Grasser.
###465 
###467 Thanks, Chris.
###470 CHRIS ROACH: My favorite trick right now is grasser reverts.
###472 Made it up.
###473 I don't know.
###474 No one else does it.
###474 It's pretty cool.
###476 -How does it work?
###477 CHRIS ROACH: You go backside wall, do a grasser, then keep
###480 rotating it.
###481 Over-rotate it and land fakey.
###483 It's pretty cool.
###484 And you poke to fakeys over-rotating,
###486 those are good, too.
###488 JP WALKER: Yeah, grasser reverts.
###488 I made them up.
###490 No one's doing but me, or something like that.
###492 
###495 I didn't even notice it back then.
###496 But it seems like if somebody said something like that now,
###499 they'd just be so crucified by everyone
###502 else, like what a claimer.
###503 You know what I mean?
###504 So it's kind of funny because I just watched that
###508 not too long ago.
###509 And I was laughing so hard about what he was
###511 saying about that.
###512 It was pretty sick.
###513 CHRIS ROACH: We were filming for Dogger's movies up in
###517 Mount Hood.
###518 And Dogger's the kind of guy who's like yeah, that's pretty
###521 sick, but I know you got more in you.
###522 You know?
###523 You got to start bringing that thing around or
###524 do something else.
###525 And I was like, well, dude, what about backside 360s?
###528 We'll do grasser and turn it around.
###530 He's like do it, do it.
###532 So that's when it started up in Mount Hood.
###535 And during the summer, we started doing those.
###537 I think I was the only one doing them that day.
###540 Obviously, Noah and all those guys started doing
###542 them right away too.
###543 But I think Dogger pushed me into doing them that day.
###548 It was good when Santa Cruz called and said they were
###551 going to make snowboards, you know, super excited.
###555 Joel Gomez was the team manager.
###558 Me, Mike Ranquet, and John Cardiel were the first riders.
###561 And to me, that was an all time team.
###564 I was so excited to have that as a team.
###566 And I remember telling Joel, I was like man, whatever we do,
###569 we've got to keep this team together.
###570 This is a great, great team for this time in the sport.
###575 There's not that much skateboard influence, and we
###577 could take this long way.
###578 And it fell apart right away.
###580 Santa Cruz just didn't have the money, or didn't want to
###583 pay those boys what they needed to make.
###586 And I stayed, and was happy to stay, but I sure would have
###589 liked to have them on as teammates a couple more years
###592 or whatever.
###593 MIKE RANQUET: I rode for Sessions at the time.
###595 And so did Roach.
###597 And Sessions didn't even close then.
###600 It was like the coolest shop sponsor to have.
###602 And Santa Cruz hired Joel as a team manager.
###605 And yes, so it just made sense.
###607 Santa Cruz snowboards sponsor Roach and Ranquet, you know?
###611 And that to us was so cool because Santa Cruz was
###614 so cool back then.
###614 But their snowboard division got taken over by the
###616 Europeans, and all of a sudden, the snowboarding side
###619 of Santa Cruz wasn't as cool as we thought it
###621 would be, you know?
###622 So we're not dealing with NHS, like Independent Trucks, Santa
###625 Cruz skateboards.
###626 We're not dealing with that.
###626 We're dealing with some hotshot
###629 racer guys from Europe.
###631 And so when we got kicked out of Japan, that was over the
###635 top for them.
###636 They were just like, fuck that.
###640 -Easter man.
###641 
###646 -Or Ted Martin?
###647 Is that the guy?
###650 JERRY DUGAN: Yeah, so Ranquet rode for
###651 pretty much the shitsters.
###653 They were the worst.
###654 I mean, they're the two that got kicked out of Japan.
###656 And they were together, just like bad news.
###659 A food fight happened in an area that
###661 shouldn't have happened.
###664 And it was stupid.
###665 They were just drunk and being dumb.
###668 But it wasn't like they got their hands slapped.
###670 They basically got kicked off the property, kicked out of
###672 Japan, and sent home.
###674 Yeah, the Japanese had a little different understanding
###678 of what should be appropriate or not appropriate behavior.
###681 DAMIAN SANDERS: They were pretty serious over there.
###682 And it's funny how they can kick you out of their country.
###684 Like around here, they might put you in jail
###686 or give you a ticket.
###687 But they rounded them up and actually escorted them to the
###690 airport and got them on a plane and said see ya.
###693 [LAUGHTER]
###695 -You got to film getting on the bus, dude.
###698 You got to walk out, Mike.
###701 -Where's Roach?
###703 -The rubber frog incident, bro.
###707 Gonna miss you.
###708 
###714 -Bye, guys!
###715 -I love you.
###716 -Bye, guys!
###717 -Bye, guys!
###719 MIKE RANQUET: I mean, it wasn't any part due to
###722 anything Joel did or said.
###724 He was just the messenger, you know what I mean?
###726 He felt bad for both sides because he saw that you can
###729 capitalize on these kids, but he also saw that in their
###732 eyes, we blew it, 100%.
###735 We got kicked off the World Cup tour forever.
###738 We get kicked out of Japan.
###739 And I also knew, and I tried to tell Chris at the time,
###742 like Santa Cruz ain't going to back you.
###744 They're not at all.
###747 They're going to brush you under the rug.
###748 And they did.
###750 But Roach, out of pride, just like NorCal, dude.
###754 You know?
###755 Like, Santa Cruz.
###757 And I wish I could still feel that then, because I kind of
###760 did, only because of the camaraderie of Roach and I.
###764 But the other thing was I found I could hang out with
###768 Roach more.
###768 Because at the end of Santa Cruz, they didn't want us
###770 hanging out together.
###771 They wouldn't put us on trips together.
###773 You know what I mean?
###774 And all of a sudden, I was like, killer.
###775 I can go hang out with Roach.
###777 There's no weird binding thing.
###780 But it was just kind of like too bad to watch Roach at the
###783 height of his riding and kind of image just get a wet
###788 blanket put over him by his sponsor.
###790 They gave him a pro model, but they didn't promote it.
###794 You know what I mean?
###794 So Roach probably sold one board for every five of mine,
###797 which then Noah sold probably 10 for every one of mine, you
###801 know what I mean?
###802 So me and Noah had these successful pro models.
###805 And Roach's was successful, but they didn't promote it.
###810 It's like a band having a record contract.
###813 And then all of a sudden, the record company ain't going to
###815 promote their record.
###816 It's going to sell, but not as well as with advertising,
###820 blah, blah, blah.
###821 CHRIS ROACH: You know, I kind of went full circle, and now I
###823 have another model with them.
###824 And I get to still be involved in Santa Cruz.
###827 So Santa Cruz definitely has given me a good life.
###831 And they've always been behind me, and I appreciate that.
###836 MIKE RANQUET: After the Japan incident where we both got
###838 kicked out, I went back to Japan the next year.
###842 He never went back.
###843 But he was fine with that.
###844 He was cool just not traveling.
###846 He just didn't care, you know?
###848 He was like, dude, I just want to kick it at home in Tahoe,
###849 go to Grass Valley, smoke pot.
###852 You know?
###853 That's pretty funny.
###854 This guy's got the opportunity to go anywhere in the world,
###857 he's like eh, you know?
###858 Like, yawn.
###861 CHRIS ROACH: If you're a professional snowboarder and
###862 you got to just do videos, I think that in
###864 itself was a statement.
###867 You know, you didn't have to deal with
###868 the pressure of contests.
###870 You didn't have to go to all the shitty resorts and spend
###874 your time doing that.
###875 You could chase the snow and the weather and
###878 be with your friends.
###880 And that atmosphere, it was obviously a lot funner.
###884 There's always pressure to try to get footage and stuff.
###886 But it's a different kind of pressure.
###888 It's more enjoyable.
###890 I think Montana was one of my funnest ones with Ranquet and
###894 Graham, and probably Seoane too.
###897 Just the snow was so good.
###898 It snowed so much up there in big sky Montana.
###901 That was a super fun trip.
###902 And I don't remember too much of any of those.
###907 I don't remember any of my own highlights
###909 in any of the movies.
###911 JASON BORGSTEDE: You know you were watching
###912 people's whole season.
###914 They were hour, hour and a half long movies, you know?
###916 What I remember more than anything is getting a Santa
###918 Cruz towel, riding down the hill.
###921 And in those days, you just emulated in your head.
###924 You thought, OK, I'm basically this guy this run.
###927 You know?
###928 And him and Noah and people like that were those guys for
###931 me a lot of times.
###932 I remember, of course, his broken leg in critical
###935 condition, and all that stuff.
###938 CHRIS ROACH: Yeah, we were at Snowbird, and there's a blind
###944 little drop.
###944 And Tucker went off at first, and I yelled at him, how fast?
###948 He goes, as fast as you want.
###949 And I was like, all right, cool.
###950 Not that it's Tucker's fault by any means, but we were
###953 setting up, and I just went off it I guess too fast and
###957 jumped right into little trees and hooked up into them, and
###960 just started rag dolling had over and stopped.
###963 And my femur got wrapped around a tree and broke and
###969 sat in the fucking snow for probably an hour or whatever
###972 because we were out of bounds and with my shirt up and snow
###975 down my back and got dragged out of there and waited for
###980 the helicopter.
###982 As soon as the morphine kicked in, I was all right.
###984 Took the helicopter ride into the hospital, and that
###987 hospital treated me really well for a few weeks until I
###990 flew home and got healed up.
###992 Two and a half months into it, I went to Chile with Dave
###995 Seoane just to see-- and Noah Salasnek-- to see how my knee
###999 was, or my femur.
###1001 And the only thing that hurt was my knee where they tied
###1003 that rod to my knee.
###1004 And I was stoked to be back on the snow two and a half months
###1007 after that.
###1008 -What's up, dude?
###1008 We're in Chile.
###1009 We're having fun.
###1010 [INAUDIBLE].
###1011 A lot of nice girls come from different countries.
###1015 -OK, OK.
###1015 Stop.
###1016 Stop.
###1016 CHRIS ROACH: Portillo's in Chile.
###1018 And yeah, I went there with I think the same guys, Noah and
###1022 Dave Seoane and Shawn Farmer.
###1025 That was just the funnest trip.
###1028 You go up there in the summer, it's like Tahoe weather.
###1030 It snowed for probably three days, and was probably 60
###1033 degrees during the day.
###1035 And then it's like a little resort for maybe the Brazilian
###1040 people who come down or whoever comes down and spends
###1043 their summertimes or whatever.
###1046 So it's a night life thing too.
###1047 You don't have to leave the mountain.
###1050 Everything's right there at the resort.
###1053 -The strobe lights are going.
###1054 So they can't really see my moves.
###1056 CHRIS ROACH: I don't know, man.
###1057 I found one little troll thing.
###1062 And I think Noah had some fun with maybe one other
###1065 one, and you know.
###1068 The girls, we couldn't speak their language.
###1070 They couldn't speak ours.
###1071 So it was kind of one of those fun things.
###1072 You know, you just mess around.
###1076 -That's right, that's right.
###1078 Come one.
###1079 -I hate you.
###1081 -She hates me.
###1084 -But I love him.
###1086 CHRIS ROACH: I think we were in Colorado, one of those
###1089 mountains, just because Colorado, they think they have
###1092 the best mountains, but there's nothing there.
###1094 It's just all fucking ski slopes.
###1097 So you stay in bounds.
###1098 And there's nothing else to do there besides do
###1102 blood slides and shit.
###1103 So we did those for a week and learned how to press the board
###1107 up shitty hill and trying to progress snowboarding.
###1110 What can we have fun doing, you know?
###1112 Nothing to jump and nothing to do.
###1116 I don't know, man.
###1117 I don't know.
###1117 I don't like the--
###1118 I don't know.
###1119 Whatever, you know how it is.
###1123 Just, I guess, having fun and riding sideways.
###1127 I don't know.
###1128 I didn't do anything for anybody that I didn't give it.
###1130 I don't know.
###1131 If I did something for younger kids, and I like to give my
###1135 boards away as well at contests, and that was it.
###1139 I didn't try to snowboard for anybody or any other reasons
###1144 than for me.
###1144 And if I help people enjoy it more, then that's cool.
###1149 But nothing more than that.
###1152 I wouldn't change anything I ever did.
###1154 I mean, shit, I went through my snowboarding career pretty
###1157 much just partying and having fun.
###1159 I mean, snowboarding was on the back burner almost to me.
###1162 And that's unfortunate, but that's the way it was.
###1165 You know, you do what you can, but you know what I mean.
###1167 And you would do shit a little smarter, maybe put a little
###1170 bit more money in the bank and shit.
###1173 But you know, I mean, what do you do?
###1174 You know, you're out getting paid to travel the world and
###1177 ride ski lifts.
###1178 I mean, that's incredible.
###1180 I mean, who doesn't dream about that kind
###1182 of shit, you know?
###1182 That's insane.
###1183
