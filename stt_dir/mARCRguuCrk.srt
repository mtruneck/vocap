1
0:0:9,734 --> 0:0:12,353
When you know


2
0:0:12,353 --> 0:0:15,5
that you know


3
0:0:15,5 --> 0:0:16,855
who you love,


4
0:0:16,855 --> 0:0:20,235
you can't deny it.


5
0:0:20,235 --> 0:0:22,507
Or go back,


6
0:0:22,507 --> 0:0:25,215
or give up,


7
0:0:25,215 --> 0:0:27,753
or pretend


8
0:0:27,753 --> 0:0:30,475
that you don't buy it.


9
0:0:30,475 --> 0:0:33,363
When it's clear this time


10
0:0:33,363 --> 0:0:35,707
you've found the one,


11
0:0:35,707 --> 0:0:40,671
you'll never let him go


12
0:0:40,671 --> 0:0:43,39
'cause you know


13
0:0:43,39 --> 0:0:46,17
and you know


14
0:0:46,17 --> 0:0:51,434
that you know.


15
0:0:51,434 --> 0:0:54,74
When you feel


16
0:0:54,74 --> 0:0:56,579
in your skin,


17
0:0:56,579 --> 0:0:59,238
in your bones,


18
0:0:59,238 --> 0:1:1,873
and the hollow


19
0:1:1,873 --> 0:1:4,402
of your heart,


20
0:1:4,402 --> 0:1:7,101
there's no way


21
0:1:7,101 --> 0:1:9,791
you can wait


22
0:1:9,791 --> 0:1:12,45
'til tomorrow.


23
0:1:12,45 --> 0:1:17,968
When there isn't any doubt about it


24
0:1:17,968 --> 0:1:22,596
once you come this close


25
0:1:22,596 --> 0:1:25,283
'cause you know


26
0:1:25,283 --> 0:1:27,944
and you know


27
0:1:27,944 --> 0:1:33,76
that you know.


28
0:1:33,76 --> 0:1:35,643
You can feel


29
0:1:35,643 --> 0:1:38,147
love's around you


30
0:1:38,147 --> 0:1:40,757
like the sky


31
0:1:40,757 --> 0:1:43,429
'round the moon.


32
0:1:43,429 --> 0:1:45,885
This is how


33
0:1:45,885 --> 0:1:48,412
love has found you,


34
0:1:48,412 --> 0:1:50,941
now you know


35
0:1:50,941 --> 0:1:53,828
what to do.


36
0:1:53,828 --> 0:1:56,238
When you know


37
0:1:56,238 --> 0:1:59,14
that you know


38
0:1:59,14 --> 0:2:1,547
who you need,


39
0:2:1,547 --> 0:2:4,532
you can't deny it


40
0:2:4,532 --> 0:2:6,788
or go back,


41
0:2:6,788 --> 0:2:9,381
or give up,


42
0:2:9,381 --> 0:2:11,864
or pretend


43
0:2:11,864 --> 0:2:14,623
that you don't buy it.


44
0:2:14,623 --> 0:2:17,312
When it's clear this time


45
0:2:17,312 --> 0:2:20,94
you've found the one,


46
0:2:20,94 --> 0:2:24,989
you'll never let him go


47
0:2:24,989 --> 0:2:27,716
'cause you know


48
0:2:27,716 --> 0:2:30,4
and you know


49
0:2:30,4 --> 0:2:33,198
that you know.


50
0:2:33,198 --> 0:2:35,47
Hmmm...


51
0:2:35,47 --> 0:2:38,35
And it's time


52
0:2:38,35 --> 0:2:40,795
you come in


53
0:2:40,795 --> 0:2:43,406
from the cold.


54
0:2:43,406 --> 0:2:45,746
Haaa...


55
0:2:45,746 --> 0:2:48,556
And you know


56
0:2:48,556 --> 0:4:48,556
that you know.
