0:0:27,477 --> 0:0:30,53
JON KESSLER: I had a friend in
undergrad who grew up on North


5
0:0:30,53 --> 0:0:31,1
7th Street.


6
0:0:31,1 --> 0:0:32,52
He was Polish-American.


7
0:0:32,52 --> 0:0:35,15
I was in the East Village
for six months in a


8
0:0:35,15 --> 0:0:37,64
tiny, crappy apartment.


9
0:0:37,64 --> 0:0:40,35
He just said, you should really
check out the first


10
0:0:40,35 --> 0:0:41,58
stop on the L train.


11
0:0:41,58 --> 0:0:43,16
And I'd never been
out here before.


12
0:0:43,16 --> 0:0:47,68
And came out, drew a circle on
the map around the Bedford


13
0:0:47,68 --> 0:0:48,45
Avenue stop.


14
0:0:48,45 --> 0:0:51,97
And that day, I found about
six or seven places.


15
0:0:51,97 --> 0:0:55,965
And I moved into this building
where I paid $150 a month for


16
0:0:55,965 --> 0:0:58,59
the whole building, and
I got a 10-year lease.


17
0:0:58,59 --> 0:0:59,93
MALE SPEAKER: What
year was that?


18
0:0:59,93 --> 0:1:2,45
JON KESSLER: That was 1980.


19
0:1:2,45 --> 0:1:8,41
I had that moment in my life
which I'd wanted, which was


20
0:1:8,41 --> 0:1:11,28
the older generation had had
it in Tribeca and in Soho,


21
0:1:11,28 --> 0:1:15,6
where you just go to a factory
building, and the landlord


22
0:1:15,6 --> 0:1:18,79
just could not imagine that
you'd want to live in an


23
0:1:18,79 --> 0:1:19,7
abandoned factory.


24
0:1:19,7 --> 0:1:21,89
And this neighborhood was
so desolate at night.


25
0:1:21,89 --> 0:1:24,3
And he was just happy
to have someone


26
0:1:24,3 --> 0:1:25,42
looking over his factory.


27
0:1:25,42 --> 0:1:27,38
It really seemed far
away back then.


28
0:1:27,38 --> 0:1:29,24
I mean, I would tell people
I was going to Manhattan.


29
0:1:29,24 --> 0:1:30,89
They'd say, you going
to the city?


30
0:1:30,89 --> 0:1:33,41
This is only 27 years
ago, but it really


31
0:1:33,41 --> 0:1:35,8
was a different mindset.


32
0:1:35,8 --> 0:1:37,29
This is a photograph--


33
0:1:37,29 --> 0:1:41,51
which I didn't take, it actually
was given to me-- of


34
0:1:41,51 --> 0:1:45,73
a flower arrangement from Japan
of quite a well-known


35
0:1:45,73 --> 0:1:49,56
arranger, Sofu Teshigahara.


36
0:1:49,56 --> 0:1:52,4
And this will be motorized
and mechanized.


37
0:1:52,4 --> 0:1:56,77
And so the motor here will be
moving these panels slowly, so


38
0:1:56,77 --> 0:2:1,3
it actually deconstructs and
looks like that a lot.


39
0:2:1,3 --> 0:2:2,52
But these are constantly
shifting.


40
0:2:2,52 --> 0:2:4,63
And there is one moment
when it registers, and


41
0:2:4,63 --> 0:2:5,88
it looks like that.


42
0:2:5,88 --> 0:2:10,139



43
0:2:10,139 --> 0:2:14,39
And I've used motors and lights
principally since I


44
0:2:14,39 --> 0:2:17,94
started showing in 1983
at Artist's Space.


45
0:2:17,94 --> 0:2:19,19
It was my first show.


46
0:2:19,19 --> 0:2:21,84



47
0:2:21,84 --> 0:2:25,17
The work always did have a
relationship to what was


48
0:2:25,17 --> 0:2:28,63
mechanically creating
a representation.


49
0:2:28,63 --> 0:2:31,34
Sometimes that representation
would be projected onto a


50
0:2:31,34 --> 0:2:34,52
screen, sometimes a
representation would just be


51
0:2:34,52 --> 0:2:40,49
the performance itself that
would sort of flatten out.


52
0:2:40,49 --> 0:2:42,56
I learned how to do all the
stuff I was doing just from


53
0:2:42,56 --> 0:2:44,74
the store owners on
Canal Street.


54
0:2:44,74 --> 0:2:49,32
They were so generous, and I
didn't know really how to wire


55
0:2:49,32 --> 0:2:50,17
up a light bulb.


56
0:2:50,17 --> 0:2:54,73
And I'd go in there, and it was
pretty desolate back then,


57
0:2:54,73 --> 0:2:56,97
Canal Street.


58
0:2:56,97 --> 0:3:2,93
It wasn't the pirated CD, Louis
Vuitton, Gucci industry


59
0:3:2,93 --> 0:3:3,43
that it is now.


60
0:3:3,43 --> 0:3:7,18
It was just kind of a sleepy,
industrial, surplus


61
0:3:7,18 --> 0:3:7,72
neighborhood.


62
0:3:7,72 --> 0:3:11,79
And I'd go in there, and
buy the owners a beer.


63
0:3:11,79 --> 0:3:14,68
And they'd sit down with me
and draw up diagrams.


64
0:3:14,68 --> 0:3:17,192
That's how I really learned how
to make what I'm making.


65
0:3:17,192 --> 0:3:18,47
That was my school.


66
0:3:18,47 --> 0:3:23,79



67
0:3:23,79 --> 0:3:25,14
This space had been
abandoned for 20


68
0:3:25,14 --> 0:3:26,59
years, so it was a wreck.


69
0:3:26,59 --> 0:3:27,46
It was really a wreck.


70
0:3:27,46 --> 0:3:31,725
I lived without a toilet for
almost six months, and I had a


71
0:3:31,725 --> 0:3:33,9
wood burning stove.


72
0:3:33,9 --> 0:3:36,56
So I used to go out with my
truck, and collecting wood


73
0:3:36,56 --> 0:3:40,6
pallets, bringing them home,
chopping them up with a


74
0:3:40,6 --> 0:3:43,54
chainsaw, and sticking them
in the wood stove.


75
0:3:43,54 --> 0:3:47,73



76
0:3:47,73 --> 0:3:51,89
With Planet Thailand, they
started in Green Point, and


77
0:3:51,89 --> 0:3:53,7
then they opened a small little


78
0:3:53,7 --> 0:3:54,35
restaurant on Bedford Avenue.


79
0:3:54,35 --> 0:3:55,68
And then they opened
this big place.


80
0:3:55,68 --> 0:3:58,873
And when they did, they asked
me to design the fountain.


81
0:3:58,873 --> 0:3:59,82
MALE SPEAKER: How'd
they know you?


82
0:3:59,82 --> 0:4:1,88
JON KESSLER: They actually
knew me through my friend


83
0:4:1,88 --> 0:4:5,76
Julius, who was the general
contractor on this job.


84
0:4:5,76 --> 0:4:7,1
And they didn't know me.


85
0:4:7,1 --> 0:4:9,15
They just basically said
they wanted a fountain.


86
0:4:9,15 --> 0:4:12,85
And Julius said, you got to look
at my friend Jon's work.


87
0:4:12,85 --> 0:4:14,52
So that's how it happened.


88
0:4:14,52 --> 0:4:18,0
The idea was to make a
fountain with a boat.


89
0:4:18,0 --> 0:4:20,88
I was determined to do
it without a motor.


90
0:4:20,88 --> 0:4:24,95
So I guess starting with the
idea of maybe a rowboat, I


91
0:4:24,95 --> 0:4:26,93
happened to have found
a large boat which


92
0:4:26,93 --> 0:4:29,4
had two sets of oars.


93
0:4:29,4 --> 0:4:31,0
And then the symmetry
of the fore-oars


94
0:4:31,0 --> 0:4:32,61
sort of found itself.


95
0:4:32,61 --> 0:4:36,5
And then I used the principle
of a Japanese--


96
0:4:36,5 --> 0:4:39,54
this is quite common in a
Japanese garden, which would


97
0:4:39,54 --> 0:4:43,57
be a bamboo cup which would
fill up with water.


98
0:4:43,57 --> 0:4:47,99
And then the weight of the water
would tip the cup over.


99
0:4:47,99 --> 0:4:49,48
And it would make a
knocking sound.


100
0:4:49,48 --> 0:4:52,65
Just a sort of typical Japanese
idea of just the


101
0:4:52,65 --> 0:4:53,73
small sound.


102
0:4:53,73 --> 0:4:55,19
You're aware of it.


103
0:4:55,19 --> 0:4:56,64
It keeps time.


104
0:4:56,64 --> 0:5:0,35
And so when the cups fill up,
actually the oars move.


105
0:5:0,35 --> 0:5:2,91
And then when the cups release
the water, the


106
0:5:2,91 --> 0:5:3,91
oars move back down.


107
0:5:3,91 --> 0:5:6,22
So it's a constant
moving piece.


108
0:5:6,22 --> 0:5:10,34
The last element was the duck,
which is actually a taxidermy


109
0:5:10,34 --> 0:5:13,62
duck that-- oh, my god, this is
such a crazy trip, going to


110
0:5:13,62 --> 0:5:16,82
a taxidermist in the Bronx.


111
0:5:16,82 --> 0:5:18,26
I found him in the
Yellow Pages.


112
0:5:18,26 --> 0:5:21,1
And I go back there, and
it was mostly rats.


113
0:5:21,1 --> 0:5:24,23
He had mostly taxidermy rats,
and then this one duck.


114
0:5:24,23 --> 0:5:25,75
I called him on the phone,
he said he had a duck.


115
0:5:25,75 --> 0:5:26,57
And I go there.


116
0:5:26,57 --> 0:5:28,35
And then I put a life
preserver on him.


117
0:5:28,35 --> 0:5:30,415
And he's wearing a little
sailor cap, and


118
0:5:30,415 --> 0:5:31,798
he's walking the plank.


119
0:5:31,798 --> 0:5:35,74



120
0:5:35,74 --> 0:5:36,525
MALE SPEAKER: You ever get
mugged on this street?


121
0:5:36,525 --> 0:5:37,47
JON KESSLER: Yeah.


122
0:5:37,47 --> 0:5:43,62
I wasn't mugged, but I had a
knife to my throat, right at


123
0:5:43,62 --> 0:5:44,92
my driveway.


124
0:5:44,92 --> 0:5:51,31
And it turns out the guy puts
a knife to my throat.


125
0:5:51,31 --> 0:5:55,35
And he was the guy from
Joe's Busy Corner.


126
0:5:55,35 --> 0:5:56,25
The girls--


127
0:5:56,25 --> 0:5:57,8
slice him up, Jimmie!


128
0:5:57,8 --> 0:5:59,15
Slice him up!


129
0:5:59,15 --> 0:6:0,41
And I'm like, I got
a knife here.


130
0:6:0,41 --> 0:6:2,56
And I'm like, you're the guy
from Joe's Busy Corner!


131
0:6:2,56 --> 0:6:7,91



132
0:6:7,91 --> 0:6:10,7
They could have slit
my throat.


133
0:6:10,7 --> 0:6:13,783
And no one would have found
me here for a few days.


134
0:6:13,783 --> 0:6:21,511



135
0:6:21,511 --> 0:6:25,38



136
0:6:25,38 --> 0:6:29,81
It wasn't until after 9/11,
really, that the work changed


137
0:6:29,81 --> 0:6:31,62
with the use of video.


138
0:6:31,62 --> 0:6:36,3
And I had in mind a piece which
was in the PS1 show


139
0:6:36,3 --> 0:6:39,38
called "One Hour Photo." Just
really, I couldn't get the


140
0:6:39,38 --> 0:6:42,58
image of the cockpit, what the
terrorists saw on 9/11, I


141
0:6:42,58 --> 0:6:43,44
couldn't get it out
of my head.


142
0:6:43,44 --> 0:6:45,4
And I decided to actually
create it.


143
0:6:45,4 --> 0:6:48,13
I used a surveillance camera
in order to make that scene


144
0:6:48,13 --> 0:6:52,8
come to life using postcards
of the World Trade Center.


145
0:6:52,8 --> 0:6:54,11
And that's when the work really


146
0:6:54,11 --> 0:6:56,69
shifted and took a turn.


147
0:6:56,69 --> 0:7:0,78
And all of a sudden I had this
duality between the mechanisms


148
0:7:0,78 --> 0:7:2,54
and the monitors.


149
0:7:2,54 --> 0:7:6,55
And that's when the work got a
new life, I would say, like a


150
0:7:6,55 --> 0:7:8,424
new pair of legs.


151
0:7:8,424 --> 0:7:16,63



152
0:7:16,63 --> 0:7:19,58
The research that I did for the
show I feel like wasn't


153
0:7:19,58 --> 0:7:23,18
really anything special, having
lived in America in the


154
0:7:23,18 --> 0:7:27,145
last four years, that we are
all sort of experiencing


155
0:7:27,145 --> 0:7:31,4
day-to-day all the lies and all
the deceit, and the shock


156
0:7:31,4 --> 0:7:34,61
at things like, well, Bush
winning the first time around,


157
0:7:34,61 --> 0:7:37,29
and then Bush winning again
the second time around.


158
0:7:37,29 --> 0:7:40,19
It was an incredible
disappointment


159
0:7:40,19 --> 0:7:42,15
and shock to me.


160
0:7:42,15 --> 0:7:46,44



161
0:7:46,44 --> 0:7:48,9
I think the show does
encapsulate a certain amount


162
0:7:48,9 --> 0:7:52,3
of rage that I have, and
disappointment, but also a


163
0:7:52,3 --> 0:7:55,21
certain alienation that I have,
the country in some ways


164
0:7:55,21 --> 0:7:59,8
being stolen from me, and that
the Constitution was being


165
0:7:59,8 --> 0:8:0,19
stolen from us.


166
0:8:0,19 --> 0:8:6,5
And that in a funny way, had you
told me that I'd be making


167
0:8:6,5 --> 0:8:8,61
this show four years ago, I
wouldn't have believed you.


168
0:8:8,61 --> 0:8:11,7
And I feel in some ways I'm sort
of like Michael Douglas


169
0:8:11,7 --> 0:8:14,42
in "Falling Down," or Henry
Fonda in "The Wrong Man," or


170
0:8:14,42 --> 0:8:16,1
something, being
pushed, pushed,


171
0:8:16,1 --> 0:8:18,39
pushed, until this happens.


172
0:8:18,39 --> 0:8:23,854
And I'm just reacting to
what's coming upon me.


173
0:8:23,854 --> 0:8:29,7



174
0:8:29,7 --> 0:8:34,919
It was almost like a diary, just
like me processing all of


175
0:8:34,919 --> 0:8:38,309
that information, all of that
day-to-day existence in


176
0:8:38,309 --> 0:8:42,21
America, from 9/11 to the
buildup of the war, to the


177
0:8:42,21 --> 0:8:44,66
Hurricane Katrina, to lots of


178
0:8:44,66 --> 0:8:46,88
connections that were happening.


179
0:8:46,88 --> 0:8:49,59
And coming to the studio, and
really sort of for the first


180
0:8:49,59 --> 0:8:54,57
time maybe in a very long time
where I was just working very,


181
0:8:54,57 --> 0:8:58,5
very intuitively, very
immediately, and very, very


182
0:8:58,5 --> 0:8:58,92
quickly, actually.


183
0:8:58,92 --> 0:9:4,6
And then not even processing
it so much.


184
0:9:4,6 --> 0:9:10,1
Really just consciously sort
of knowing that as I was


185
0:9:10,1 --> 0:9:12,32
working, I was getting my
confidence back, and my


186
0:9:12,32 --> 0:9:15,57
intuition was being restored,
and I was just


187
0:9:15,57 --> 0:9:16,91
going to let it flow.


188
0:9:16,91 --> 0:9:18,975
And that's what I did.


189
0:9:18,975 --> 0:9:24,21



190
0:9:24,21 --> 0:9:26,38
Toys have been something that's
been very consistent in


191
0:9:26,38 --> 0:9:28,73
my work since the beginning.


192
0:9:28,73 --> 0:9:32,61
I think of the necessity
in this work to play.


193
0:9:32,61 --> 0:9:34,72
It doesn't come off didactic.


194
0:9:34,72 --> 0:9:38,9
And there's a level of play
that disarms the viewer.


195
0:9:38,9 --> 0:9:42,15
And then you can, on
top of that, lay on


196
0:9:42,15 --> 0:9:43,88
any content you want.


197
0:9:43,88 --> 0:9:47,19
And I think there's a
certain power in the


198
0:9:47,19 --> 0:9:48,65
simplicity of the mechanism.


199
0:9:48,65 --> 0:9:51,65
But then the image that you see
on the screen is actually


200
0:9:51,65 --> 0:9:52,9
quite sophisticated.


201
0:9:52,9 --> 0:10:3,27



202
0:10:3,27 --> 0:10:6,15
I wanted people to be suspicious
of the images that


203
0:10:6,15 --> 0:10:7,47
they're getting.


204
0:10:7,47 --> 0:10:10,58
I think you have to constantly
be questioning how those


205
0:10:10,58 --> 0:10:13,35
images are coming at you, why
they're coming at you,


206
0:10:13,35 --> 0:10:18,8
connecting the dots back to what
the media, in some ways,


207
0:10:18,8 --> 0:10:19,72
is constructing for you.


208
0:10:19,72 --> 0:10:22,3
And these pieces
are all there.


209
0:10:22,3 --> 0:10:24,63
There's not a single thing in
that show that is not in the


210
0:10:24,63 --> 0:10:26,7
room if you have the
energy and the will


211
0:10:26,7 --> 0:10:28,388
to deconstruct it.


212
0:10:28,388 --> 0:10:37,37



213
0:10:37,37 --> 0:10:40,73
When I'm working on a
show, I don't know--


214
0:10:40,73 --> 0:10:42,83
especially one of these big
shows, like the show I'm


215
0:10:42,83 --> 0:10:48,88
planning, in scope is going to
be a very ambitious project


216
0:10:48,88 --> 0:10:51,18
like the "Palace At 4 AM." And
I don't know what it's going


217
0:10:51,18 --> 0:10:52,31
to be like before I start.


218
0:10:52,31 --> 0:10:57,35
And I really do feel like I'm
finding my way in the dark,


219
0:10:57,35 --> 0:11:2,9
and just gathering evidence,
and gathering forensic


220
0:11:2,9 --> 0:11:5,77
information, bits and pieces,
like after the bombing, in


221
0:11:5,77 --> 0:11:10,5
order to put it back together,
the scene of the crime.


222
0:11:10,5 --> 0:11:11,86
The show is called "10:10--


223
0:11:11,86 --> 0:11:15,93
The Time Was Now." And there's
going to be photographs I'm


224
0:11:15,93 --> 0:11:16,47
working on.


225
0:11:16,47 --> 0:11:18,56
There's going to be sculptural
installations.


226
0:11:18,56 --> 0:11:21,37
There's going to be lots of
monitors all over the room.


227
0:11:21,37 --> 0:11:22,76
So it's very, very crowded.


228
0:11:22,76 --> 0:11:23,94
These are very large.


229
0:11:23,94 --> 0:11:28,5
These are these paper pulp
pieces I'm working on.


230
0:11:28,5 --> 0:11:32,37
These will be covering the
walls of suicide bombers.


231
0:11:32,37 --> 0:11:35,135
Then you walk in, and it's
sort of all about time.


232
0:11:35,135 --> 0:11:35,89
Here's the time.


233
0:11:35,89 --> 0:11:36,79
It's 10:09.


234
0:11:36,79 --> 0:11:40,0
This is like a minute before
the moment of detonation.


235
0:11:40,0 --> 0:11:42,48
These will just be covering
the walls.


236
0:11:42,48 --> 0:11:43,74
MALE SPEAKER: They're
all 10:10.


237
0:11:43,74 --> 0:11:46,785
JON KESSLER: They're all,
you know, 10:08, 10:09.


238
0:11:46,785 --> 0:11:51,34
And it's really how the
advertisers choose to portray


239
0:11:51,34 --> 0:11:53,36
the watch face, because
it's kind of like


240
0:11:53,36 --> 0:11:54,45
a happy face, right?


241
0:11:54,45 --> 0:11:55,99
And it still shows the logo.


242
0:11:55,99 --> 0:11:59,96
So I'm just taking advantage
of that fact, and sampling,


243
0:11:59,96 --> 0:12:3,17
and using that, and stealing
the watch ads for my show.


244
0:12:3,17 --> 0:12:6,14



245
0:12:6,14 --> 0:12:9,48
The whole center of the show
is going to be sort of like


246
0:12:9,48 --> 0:12:13,94
the atrocity exhibition of
using figurines, mostly


247
0:12:13,94 --> 0:12:18,7
soldiers, to create
these events.


248
0:12:18,7 --> 0:12:22,42
And here is one where
the soldier's just


249
0:12:22,42 --> 0:12:25,37
covered in crude oil.


250
0:12:25,37 --> 0:12:29,73
There's the one that you
saw where he's being


251
0:12:29,73 --> 0:12:32,42
dragged along the floor.


252
0:12:32,42 --> 0:12:35,65
And I've just started
to compose these.


253
0:12:35,65 --> 0:12:39,5



254
0:12:39,5 --> 0:12:40,96
And then there's this guy.


255
0:12:40,96 --> 0:12:44,82
He's an aging hippie waking up
sort of on the beaches of


256
0:12:44,82 --> 0:12:49,1
California, sun tanned, and
the long, gray hair, maybe


257
0:12:49,1 --> 0:12:51,45
with a bottle of Ripple
in his hand.


258
0:12:51,45 --> 0:12:58,7
And then he morphed into a kind
of much more complicated,


259
0:12:58,7 --> 0:12:59,22
political character.


260
0:12:59,22 --> 0:13:3,46
He figured very prominently in
the "Palace At 4 AM." And he


261
0:13:3,46 --> 0:13:6,6
became a piece called
"Evolution," where he became a


262
0:13:6,6 --> 0:13:6,81
right wing senator.


263
0:13:6,81 --> 0:13:10,69
And he was on a blog site
kissing the troops in Baghdad,


264
0:13:10,69 --> 0:13:12,29
and waking up in the
burning embers of


265
0:13:12,29 --> 0:13:13,31
the World Trade Center.


266
0:13:13,31 --> 0:13:18,6
But now he's really sort of
turned into just everything.


267
0:13:18,6 --> 0:13:20,0
He's the mash-up.


268
0:13:20,0 --> 0:13:22,44
I collide him with all
the characters


269
0:13:22,44 --> 0:13:23,685
that I'm working with.


270
0:13:23,685 --> 0:13:25,16
But his voice is gone.


271
0:13:25,16 --> 0:13:27,5
He's trying to speak, trying
to communicate.


272
0:13:27,5 --> 0:13:30,33
And all of those sounds, those
motor sounds, those server


273
0:13:30,33 --> 0:13:33,79
motors are actually going to
be picked up with little


274
0:13:33,79 --> 0:13:37,1
microphones that are on his
face, and they're going to be


275
0:13:37,1 --> 0:13:38,31
coming through the
sound system.


276
0:13:38,31 --> 0:13:39,16
So it'll be loud.


277
0:13:39,16 --> 0:13:40,99
It'll be sort of a
loud, worrying,


278
0:13:40,99 --> 0:13:44,3
whizzing, motor sound.


279
0:13:44,3 --> 0:13:45,48
I'm not glorifying this.


280
0:13:45,48 --> 0:13:48,26
But I really want there to be
this feeling when you walk


281
0:13:48,26 --> 0:13:52,4
into this show that death is
imminent, or that it's somehow


282
0:13:52,4 --> 0:13:56,68
suspended in that moment just
before death in order to make


283
0:13:56,68 --> 0:13:59,91
you feel completely alive.


284
0:13:59,91 --> 0:14:3,14
So the work, you can see,
has changed a lot.


285
0:14:3,14 --> 0:14:5,202
Flowers and beauty.


286
0:14:5,202 --> 0:14:8,88
Although I think the work is
quite beautiful still.


287
0:14:8,88 --> 0:16:8,88
[SOUND OF CLOCK TICKING]
