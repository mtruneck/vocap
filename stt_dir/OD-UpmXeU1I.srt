1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:12,73



2
0:0:12,73 --> 0:0:13,95
ERIK ELLINGTON: This is where
I'm going to put the tire


3
0:0:13,95 --> 0:0:17,91
swing, and eventually I'll
build Julius's tree fort.


4
0:0:17,91 --> 0:0:19,16
That's going to be sick.


5
0:0:19,16 --> 0:0:21,52



6
0:0:21,52 --> 0:0:24,82
I'm going to refinish that, get
it all cleaned up, maybe


7
0:0:24,82 --> 0:0:27,385
put some white Christmas tree
lights around here, make it


8
0:0:27,385 --> 0:0:30,6
all enchanted.


9
0:0:30,6 --> 0:0:32,7
This is the grand finale
right here.


10
0:0:32,7 --> 0:0:37,3



11
0:0:37,3 --> 0:0:40,4
There's downtown Hollywood.


12
0:0:40,4 --> 0:0:41,37
MALE SPEAKER: In life, like--


13
0:0:41,37 --> 0:0:44,6
I mean, you seem like you've
come a long way in life to get


14
0:0:44,6 --> 0:0:45,26
a place like this.


15
0:0:45,26 --> 0:0:47,31
ERIK ELLINGTON: Yeah,
I feel like that.


16
0:0:47,31 --> 0:0:49,78
I'm definitely pretty
thankful, man.


17
0:0:49,78 --> 0:0:52,16
I try not to take
it for granted.


18
0:0:52,16 --> 0:0:54,35
MALE SPEAKER: You didn't grow
up wealthy or anything?


19
0:0:54,35 --> 0:0:55,8
ERIK ELLINGTON: No, no.


20
0:0:55,8 --> 0:0:56,61
We moved around a lot.


21
0:0:56,61 --> 0:0:58,58
When we lived in Alaska,
my step-dad--


22
0:0:58,58 --> 0:0:59,64
he had money.


23
0:0:59,64 --> 0:1:0,95
He made a decent living.


24
0:1:0,95 --> 0:1:4,519
He had a body shop for
cars and stuff.


25
0:1:4,519 --> 0:1:7,54
But then like, move back and
forth, shit goes wrong up


26
0:1:7,54 --> 0:1:10,36
there, move into a janky
little apartment.


27
0:1:10,36 --> 0:1:12,7
Or, you know, whatever.


28
0:1:12,7 --> 0:1:14,82
We've been up and down.


29
0:1:14,82 --> 0:1:16,36
I think it's a good way.


30
0:1:16,36 --> 0:1:18,27
It's a good experience.


31
0:1:18,27 --> 0:1:23,76
To know both sides
of the tracks.


32
0:1:23,76 --> 0:1:26,21
Hey, how you doing?


33
0:1:26,21 --> 0:1:28,85
Oh, I just bought the
house right here.


34
0:1:28,85 --> 0:1:29,12
Yeah.


35
0:1:29,12 --> 0:1:30,53
I'm Erik Ellington.


36
0:1:30,53 --> 0:1:30,68
PATRICK O'DELL: Hi.


37
0:1:30,68 --> 0:1:32,49
Welcome back to the show.


38
0:1:32,49 --> 0:1:34,41
This episode is about
one of my favorite


39
0:1:34,41 --> 0:1:36,47
skaters, Erik Ellington.


40
0:1:36,47 --> 0:1:39,34
Erik's style is always
really cool, and the


41
0:1:39,34 --> 0:1:41,0
way he lands tricks.


42
0:1:41,0 --> 0:1:43,34
He's got something that he has
that not very many other


43
0:1:43,34 --> 0:1:44,26
skaters have.


44
0:1:44,26 --> 0:1:48,9
It's kind of sketchy, but
it just looks so cool.


45
0:1:48,9 --> 0:1:49,68
And he's still of my
favorite dudes.


46
0:1:49,68 --> 0:1:51,87
He's the kind of guy, you see
him do a flat ground kickflip,


47
0:1:51,87 --> 0:1:54,7
and you go, oh, that's
why that guy's pro.


48
0:1:54,7 --> 0:1:56,552
MALE SPEAKER: Wait, what's
on that tape you were


49
0:1:56,552 --> 0:1:57,72
going to give me?


50
0:1:57,72 --> 0:1:59,17
ERIK ELLINGTON: Old footage
from Alaska.


51
0:1:59,17 --> 0:2:1,48
Like, sponsor me tape
footage, when I


52
0:2:1,48 --> 0:2:5,33
was like 15 or something.


53
0:2:5,33 --> 0:2:6,51
We had a launch ramp.


54
0:2:6,51 --> 0:2:11,1
We put the launch ramp up to
a high ledge or something.


55
0:2:11,1 --> 0:2:12,44
Just all kinds of stuff.


56
0:2:12,44 --> 0:2:15,452
Like, little rails and
curbs and shit.


57
0:2:15,452 --> 0:2:17,8
MALE SPEAKER: What kind of
gear are you wearing?


58
0:2:17,8 --> 0:2:18,65
ERIK ELLINGTON: Let me see.


59
0:2:18,65 --> 0:2:22,55
Oh actually, 101 had just
started, maybe.


60
0:2:22,55 --> 0:2:23,71
Yeah.


61
0:2:23,71 --> 0:2:27,22
It's just maybe like shorts
and a beanie and--


62
0:2:27,22 --> 0:2:28,22
I don't know--


63
0:2:28,22 --> 0:2:29,725
a purple t-shirt or something.


64
0:2:29,725 --> 0:2:31,79
I don't know.


65
0:2:31,79 --> 0:2:35,88
I did a 360 flip board lipslide
on a curb, just a


66
0:2:35,88 --> 0:2:37,93
regular curb where you're
sliding and your wheel's over,


67
0:2:37,93 --> 0:2:40,57
so it's like--


68
0:2:40,57 --> 0:2:41,64
What else was there?


69
0:2:41,64 --> 0:2:44,644
Nollie nose manual.


70
0:2:44,644 --> 0:2:47,85
Just some stuff at the time, it
seemed like it was like--


71
0:2:47,85 --> 0:2:50,43
at the time of that,
it was kind of--


72
0:2:50,43 --> 0:2:51,68
I was pretty psyched.


73
0:2:51,68 --> 0:2:58,41



74
0:2:58,41 --> 0:3:0,32
Maybe it was a little bit before
that, I sent the tape


75
0:3:0,32 --> 0:3:1,15
to H-Street.


76
0:3:1,15 --> 0:3:2,69
And they sent me the
Mike Carroll


77
0:3:2,69 --> 0:3:4,58
Calvin and Hobbes board.


78
0:3:4,58 --> 0:3:6,46
Yeah, I was freaking out, man.


79
0:3:6,46 --> 0:3:8,44
I was shaking when
I got the box.


80
0:3:8,44 --> 0:3:9,69
That was pretty cool.


81
0:3:9,69 --> 0:3:12,515



82
0:3:12,515 --> 0:3:14,94
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah!


83
0:3:14,94 --> 0:3:16,19
Fuck, that was bad.


84
0:3:16,19 --> 0:3:19,387



85
0:3:19,387 --> 0:3:21,742
[PHONE RINGING]


86
0:3:21,742 --> 0:3:22,68
JAMIE THOMAS: Hello?


87
0:3:22,68 --> 0:3:23,57
PATRICK O'DELL: Jamie.


88
0:3:23,57 --> 0:3:26,2
This is Patrick.


89
0:3:26,2 --> 0:3:27,38
JAMIE THOMAS: Patrick,
this is Jamie.


90
0:3:27,38 --> 0:3:28,84
PATRICK O'DELL: What's
up, man?


91
0:3:28,84 --> 0:3:29,77
JAMIE THOMAS: Not much.


92
0:3:29,77 --> 0:3:32,496
PATRICK O'DELL: How would you
describe Erik's skating?


93
0:3:32,496 --> 0:3:35,59



94
0:3:35,59 --> 0:3:36,65
JAMIE THOMAS: This is
kind of a hard one.


95
0:3:36,65 --> 0:3:38,74
It's kind of like, that's
not really a good--


96
0:3:38,74 --> 0:3:40,77
I know you probably will only
use the things that make sense


97
0:3:40,77 --> 0:3:41,3
in this interview.


98
0:3:41,3 --> 0:3:43,15
But what am I supposed to say?


99
0:3:43,15 --> 0:3:44,135
He looks sick.


100
0:3:44,135 --> 0:3:46,72
And doing stuff good.


101
0:3:46,72 --> 0:3:48,68
Like, that's a hard
thing to answer.


102
0:3:48,68 --> 0:3:50,7
MALE SPEAKER: What tricks have
you done that you were the


103
0:3:50,7 --> 0:3:50,8
most psyched on?


104
0:3:50,8 --> 0:3:54,8
That you look back and you go,
that was my pinnacle trick?


105
0:3:54,8 --> 0:3:54,46
ERIK ELLINGTON: I don't know.


106
0:3:54,46 --> 0:3:56,72
I hope I really haven't
had a pinnacle trick.


107
0:3:56,72 --> 0:3:57,43
I don't even know.


108
0:3:57,43 --> 0:3:59,89
I mean, I'd say like an
era or something.


109
0:3:59,89 --> 0:4:1,1
Like, just times--


110
0:4:1,1 --> 0:4:3,1
times in your life different
things are happening, and you


111
0:4:3,1 --> 0:4:4,57
feel differently about--


112
0:4:4,57 --> 0:4:5,87
you know, I don't know.


113
0:4:5,87 --> 0:4:8,54
First video that I
was in that was--


114
0:4:8,54 --> 0:4:10,55
I guess it would have
had to have been


115
0:4:10,55 --> 0:4:12,1
the first Zero video.


116
0:4:12,1 --> 0:4:16,4
Thrill of it All was the first
video I was in that was kind


117
0:4:16,4 --> 0:4:18,1
of major, where everybody
saw it.


118
0:4:18,1 --> 0:4:20,66
But before that was the Welcome
to Hell video in the


119
0:4:20,66 --> 0:4:21,73
fringe section.


120
0:4:21,73 --> 0:4:26,27
Because Jamie Thomas came
out to Arizona.


121
0:4:26,27 --> 0:4:28,63
Me and Scott Copalman talked
to Jamie quite a bit.


122
0:4:28,63 --> 0:4:31,8
And it was like we were on
Balance at the time, and he


123
0:4:31,8 --> 0:4:33,85
was starting Zero clothing.


124
0:4:33,85 --> 0:4:36,12
So he wanted us to ride
for the clothing.


125
0:4:36,12 --> 0:4:40,42
Actually, he wanted Scott to
ride for the clothing.


126
0:4:40,42 --> 0:4:44,7
And Scott said he wouldn't do
it unless I was on too.


127
0:4:44,7 --> 0:4:46,69
Well, he just said, I won't
leave Balance unless Erik


128
0:4:46,69 --> 0:4:48,46
comes with me.


129
0:4:48,46 --> 0:4:51,4
So by default, I got on Zero.


130
0:4:51,4 --> 0:4:54,34
JUSTIN REGAN: But he did
have some slams.


131
0:4:54,34 --> 0:4:55,58
There's this one where--


132
0:4:55,58 --> 0:4:57,56
and I'm not even sure if
it's the same video.


133
0:4:57,56 --> 0:5:0,9
But it's like this
kinked rail.


134
0:5:0,9 --> 0:5:3,29
And like, I don't know.


135
0:5:3,29 --> 0:5:6,365
He just decided he wanted to
go off and do this rail.


136
0:5:6,365 --> 0:5:9,53
And he got wrecked on it.


137
0:5:9,53 --> 0:5:9,91
ERIK ELLINGTON: Oh, yeah.


138
0:5:9,91 --> 0:5:11,31
I tried to boardslide
that thing.


139
0:5:11,31 --> 0:5:12,7
I don't know what
I was thinking.


140
0:5:12,7 --> 0:5:13,5
I can't really even boardslide
kinked rails.


141
0:5:13,5 --> 0:5:15,134
I just thought, maybe
I could do it.


142
0:5:15,134 --> 0:5:19,4



143
0:5:19,4 --> 0:5:22,586
MALE SPEAKER: (SLOW MOTION)
Fucking shit.


144
0:5:22,586 --> 0:5:23,836
ERIK ELLINGTON: Dude, that
thing was like--


145
0:5:23,836 --> 0:5:26,4



146
0:5:26,4 --> 0:5:29,47
I think it was like three
or four kinks.


147
0:5:29,47 --> 0:5:33,99
No, I tried it about maybe
20 times or something.


148
0:5:33,99 --> 0:5:35,83
No, I slid through a couple
of the kinks.


149
0:5:35,83 --> 0:5:36,47
You got to, like--


150
0:5:36,47 --> 0:5:36,77
I don't know.


151
0:5:36,77 --> 0:5:38,68
I just don't really
know how to do it.


152
0:5:38,68 --> 0:5:40,6
I was just amped, you know?


153
0:5:40,6 --> 0:5:40,47
MALE SPEAKER: You
just thought--


154
0:5:40,47 --> 0:5:42,456
ERIK ELLINGTON: I thought
I could do it.


155
0:5:42,456 --> 0:5:45,2
JUSTIN REGAN: Erik's one
of those skaters that--


156
0:5:45,2 --> 0:5:49,9
he puts in the work
to get his part.


157
0:5:49,9 --> 0:5:52,656
When he does a trick, it
just looks so cool.


158
0:5:52,656 --> 0:5:57,275
And there's like sweat flying,
and his shirt's dirty because


159
0:5:57,275 --> 0:6:0,55
you know he was battling
for it.


160
0:6:0,55 --> 0:6:5,72
But somehow the one that he
makes, it's effortless.


161
0:6:5,72 --> 0:6:6,86
ERIK ELLINGTON: Zero time
was cool because


162
0:6:6,86 --> 0:6:7,8
I was kind of like--


163
0:6:7,8 --> 0:6:10,65
I was on the verge of being
kicked off Zero, and I was on


164
0:6:10,65 --> 0:6:12,92
the verge of not knowing
what I was going


165
0:6:12,92 --> 0:6:14,43
to do with my life.


166
0:6:14,43 --> 0:6:15,68
And then it was like--


167
0:6:15,68 --> 0:6:20,61
I was just like, fuck,
I'm in California.


168
0:6:20,61 --> 0:6:23,22
Tripping out, ready to be
chop, chop, chopped.


169
0:6:23,22 --> 0:6:25,8



170
0:6:25,8 --> 0:6:26,7
I don't know.


171
0:6:26,7 --> 0:6:27,0
Adrian Lopez told me.


172
0:6:27,0 --> 0:6:28,41
One time he was like, man--


173
0:6:28,41 --> 0:6:30,2
because we were on a tour, and
it was just sort of towards


174
0:6:30,2 --> 0:6:30,68
the ending.


175
0:6:30,68 --> 0:6:34,5
Like, it was after that Thrill
of it All video came out.


176
0:6:34,5 --> 0:6:36,54
And it was like, I think Jamie
had a little bit higher


177
0:6:36,54 --> 0:6:41,21
expectations for what I was
supposed to be doing.


178
0:6:41,21 --> 0:6:44,85
And then I didn't really
come through.


179
0:6:44,85 --> 0:6:45,94
I kind of was just piled out.


180
0:6:45,94 --> 0:6:49,1
I was thinking like, oh, I
was just smooth sailing.


181
0:6:49,1 --> 0:6:51,75
And then he kind of let me know
I wasn't, but in a way


182
0:6:51,75 --> 0:6:52,35
that it was like--


183
0:6:52,35 --> 0:6:55,9
I think it taught me quite a
bit about things that have


184
0:6:55,9 --> 0:6:58,91
worn off on me-- to where to
this day-- that I look back on


185
0:6:58,91 --> 0:7:4,32
and think like, those are some
fucking pretty important tips


186
0:7:4,32 --> 0:7:6,51
or pointers or whatever.


187
0:7:6,51 --> 0:7:8,66
JAMIE THOMAS: We're trying to
film for Misled Youth, and


188
0:7:8,66 --> 0:7:11,7
Scotty and Erik went through
a spell of several months


189
0:7:11,7 --> 0:7:13,35
without doing absolutely
anything.


190
0:7:13,35 --> 0:7:16,4
And everybody on the team was
trying to film, and everyone


191
0:7:16,4 --> 0:7:19,59
was trying to do things and get
stuff going for the video.


192
0:7:19,59 --> 0:7:23,5
And those guys were starting
to drink a little more and


193
0:7:23,5 --> 0:7:24,61
starting to do their
own thing.


194
0:7:24,61 --> 0:7:26,44
It kind of really didn't have
anything to do with what we


195
0:7:26,44 --> 0:7:28,26
were doing.


196
0:7:28,26 --> 0:7:31,25
And Eric had this sketchbook,
and he just-- it was basically


197
0:7:31,25 --> 0:7:33,26
a sketchbook and a journal, and
he just wrote everything


198
0:7:33,26 --> 0:7:35,49
about every day and
all this stuff.


199
0:7:35,49 --> 0:7:38,4
We're riding in a van on this
tour, and Lopez like leaned


200
0:7:38,4 --> 0:7:42,98
over and borrowed Erik's
pencil and drew a boot.


201
0:7:42,98 --> 0:7:46,33
Like, when we were filming for
Misled Youth, he probably had


202
0:7:46,33 --> 0:7:50,69
10 or 15 tricks right up until
the last month of the video.


203
0:7:50,69 --> 0:7:52,935
He seriously probably
filmed a trick a


204
0:7:52,935 --> 0:7:54,42
month up to that point.


205
0:7:54,42 --> 0:7:56,28
And then all of a sudden
he filmed like 25


206
0:7:56,28 --> 0:7:57,18
tricks in one month.


207
0:7:57,18 --> 0:8:0,18
And it was all the gnarliest
stuff in Misled Youth.


208
0:8:0,18 --> 0:8:2,17
It was all done in one month.


209
0:8:2,17 --> 0:8:5,3
And so it goes to show what
he's capable of and his


210
0:8:5,3 --> 0:8:9,3
potential, but he just always
put it off until


211
0:8:9,3 --> 0:8:10,0
he had to do it.


212
0:8:10,0 --> 0:8:12,84
And then when he had to do it,
he would always get it done.


213
0:8:12,84 --> 0:8:15,46
So that's pretty much the
story of Misled Youth.


214
0:8:15,46 --> 0:8:18,65
His part came together in the
last month and helped launch


215
0:8:18,65 --> 0:8:19,69
his pro career.


216
0:8:19,69 --> 0:8:22,42
It's pretty rad.


217
0:8:22,42 --> 0:8:25,9
ERIK ELLINGTON: They take a look
from outside of being in


218
0:8:25,9 --> 0:8:28,31
his circle, and they just
hear what he's doing.


219
0:8:28,31 --> 0:8:31,49
And a lot of the things I
disagree with, a lot of things


220
0:8:31,49 --> 0:8:33,98
he probably disagrees
with what I'm doing.


221
0:8:33,98 --> 0:8:36,539
And then a lot of
people fucking--


222
0:8:36,539 --> 0:8:37,86
I don't know--


223
0:8:37,86 --> 0:8:38,96
talk shit or something.


224
0:8:38,96 --> 0:8:40,789
But it's like, he's
down to work.


225
0:8:40,789 --> 0:8:42,929
And if somebody's not putting
in the work, then he's going


226
0:8:42,929 --> 0:8:43,835
to let them know.


227
0:8:43,835 --> 0:8:46,1
He's not going to pussy
foot around the fact


228
0:8:46,1 --> 0:8:47,704
to that, you know?


229
0:8:47,704 --> 0:8:48,954
MALE SPEAKER: Fuck him up!


230
0:8:48,954 --> 0:8:51,92



231
0:8:51,92 --> 0:8:53,17
ERIK ELLINGTON: Julius,
come here.


232
0:8:53,17 --> 0:8:56,833



233
0:8:56,833 --> 0:8:59,328
Come here.


234
0:8:59,328 --> 0:9:0,594
GREG: My name's Greg,
by the way.


235
0:9:0,594 --> 0:9:1,68
ERIK ELLINGTON: Erik.


236
0:9:1,68 --> 0:9:1,542
GREG: How do you do?


237
0:9:1,542 --> 0:9:2,792
ERIK ELLINGTON: Nice
to meet you.


238
0:9:2,792 --> 0:9:8,89



239
0:9:8,89 --> 0:9:10,14
Yeah, pro skater.


240
0:9:10,14 --> 0:9:22,925



241
0:9:22,925 --> 0:9:24,175
What is it?


242
0:9:24,175 --> 0:9:27,325



243
0:9:27,325 --> 0:9:28,7
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.


244
0:9:28,7 --> 0:9:30,14
But I wouldn't be able to
tell you without knowing


245
0:9:30,14 --> 0:9:32,1
what it was, but--


246
0:9:32,1 --> 0:9:32,865
GREG: You understand why--


247
0:9:32,865 --> 0:9:34,14
ERIK ELLINGTON: I understand
that, though.


248
0:9:34,14 --> 0:9:35,2
I understand that.


249
0:9:35,2 --> 0:9:36,51
But I pretty much--


250
0:9:36,51 --> 0:9:37,5
I can give you some--


251
0:9:37,5 --> 0:9:40,2
you could probably talk to the
people that are running this


252
0:9:40,2 --> 0:9:42,566
thing, and then maybe they can
give you some advice on what


253
0:9:42,566 --> 0:9:46,52
to do and kind of handle
things that way.


254
0:9:46,52 --> 0:9:48,16
And I was like, I'm
a little confused.


255
0:9:48,16 --> 0:9:53,41
You know, I can't really
give you much advice.


256
0:9:53,41 --> 0:9:55,43
I don't know what it is.


257
0:9:55,43 --> 0:9:56,71
I pointed him to Erica.


258
0:9:56,71 --> 0:9:59,14
I pawned him off on Erica.


259
0:9:59,14 --> 0:10:1,31
NECK FACE: Oh, Ellington is--


260
0:10:1,31 --> 0:10:2,92
Ellington's my favorite.


261
0:10:2,92 --> 0:10:4,81
I mean, he was my favorite
growing up.


262
0:10:4,81 --> 0:10:6,84
Like, seeing his skating
and shit.


263
0:10:6,84 --> 0:10:9,1
Like, damn, this fool's straight
white trash fucking


264
0:10:9,1 --> 0:10:10,5
skating and shit.


265
0:10:10,5 --> 0:10:14,19
And then when I met the
dude, it was like


266
0:10:14,19 --> 0:10:15,59
even more of my favorite.


267
0:10:15,59 --> 0:10:17,7
I was like, damn, this
fool doesn't give


268
0:10:17,7 --> 0:10:18,81
a shit about anything.


269
0:10:18,81 --> 0:10:19,96
He's fucking crazy.


270
0:10:19,96 --> 0:10:21,21
Ellington is nuts.


271
0:10:21,21 --> 0:10:27,158



272
0:10:27,158 --> 0:10:28,408
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, shit!


273
0:10:28,408 --> 0:10:31,3



274
0:10:31,3 --> 0:10:33,53
ERIK ELLINGTON: Let's get
fucked up tonight!


275
0:10:33,53 --> 0:10:34,91
ANDREW REYNOLDS: To me,
when I look at him,


276
0:10:34,91 --> 0:10:38,31
he's like Eric Koston.


277
0:10:38,31 --> 0:10:40,8
But just with this like--


278
0:10:40,8 --> 0:10:47,68
take away all the perfection
and everything and add this


279
0:10:47,68 --> 0:10:49,71
lazy attitude problem
or something.


280
0:10:49,71 --> 0:10:52,99
He's that good, but it's just
like, well whatever.


281
0:10:52,99 --> 0:10:55,48
He's really that good.


282
0:10:55,48 --> 0:10:58,95
And it's just like, everything
he does has this special


283
0:10:58,95 --> 0:11:1,95
Ellington style about it, like
every move he makes.


284
0:11:1,95 --> 0:11:5,76
It's in his skating, in his
walk, when he bowls, when he


285
0:11:5,76 --> 0:11:6,79
carries his kid.


286
0:11:6,79 --> 0:11:9,84
It's just this certain
way of doing it.


287
0:11:9,84 --> 0:11:13,77
ERIK ELLINGTON: It's not too
bad except that the top


288
0:11:13,77 --> 0:11:17,11
doesn't really match
the pants.


289
0:11:17,11 --> 0:11:17,996
All right.


290
0:11:17,996 --> 0:11:19,77
Ooh, let me get a little--


291
0:11:19,77 --> 0:11:20,398
MALE SPEAKER: Te-qui-lia.


292
0:11:20,398 --> 0:11:22,7
ERIK ELLINGTON: Have
a bit of that.


293
0:11:22,7 --> 0:11:23,32
MALE SPEAKER: Little standby.


294
0:11:23,32 --> 0:11:25,555



295
0:11:25,555 --> 0:11:27,99
ERIK ELLINGTON: Little tequila
right in there, huh?


296
0:11:27,99 --> 0:11:29,451
You look beautiful.


297
0:11:29,451 --> 0:11:30,912
Look at you.


298
0:11:30,912 --> 0:11:33,35
Look at you.


299
0:11:33,35 --> 0:11:35,395
[KISSING]


300
0:11:35,395 --> 0:11:36,2
[THUD]


301
0:11:36,2 --> 0:11:36,6
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh!


302
0:11:36,6 --> 0:11:37,732
ERIK ELLINGTON: Jujube!


303
0:11:37,732 --> 0:11:39,178
FEMALE SPEAKER: All right!


304
0:11:39,178 --> 0:11:41,11
MALE SPEAKER: How'd
you meet her?


305
0:11:41,11 --> 0:11:42,26
ERIK ELLINGTON: She
was out here.


306
0:11:42,26 --> 0:11:44,66
I wanted to take her out for
dinner, and then she took off


307
0:11:44,66 --> 0:11:46,35
the next morning
and ditched me.


308
0:11:46,35 --> 0:11:49,19
So then I took a train down
to San Diego, and I


309
0:11:49,19 --> 0:11:51,2
shacked up with her.


310
0:11:51,2 --> 0:11:53,913
Ever since then, I moved into
her apartment with like three


311
0:11:53,913 --> 0:11:55,29
of her friends.


312
0:11:55,29 --> 0:11:59,18
They bought a Suzuki Swift, this
fucking piece of shit.


313
0:11:59,18 --> 0:12:2,87
And we were driving that thing
back and forth all the time.


314
0:12:2,87 --> 0:12:8,33
It's like, damn, got
a car, rolling.


315
0:12:8,33 --> 0:12:9,92
Yeah, we got married three
months after that.


316
0:12:9,92 --> 0:12:10,325
MALE SPEAKER: Really?


317
0:12:10,325 --> 0:12:11,135
Three months?


318
0:12:11,135 --> 0:12:11,54
ERIK ELLINGTON: Mm-hmm.


319
0:12:11,54 --> 0:12:14,115
And we've been married for
seven years in October.


320
0:12:14,115 --> 0:12:15,87
MALE SPEAKER: Whoa, so you just
knew at three months?


321
0:12:15,87 --> 0:12:17,366
ERIK ELLINGTON: How
do you like that?


322
0:12:17,366 --> 0:12:18,62
MALE SPEAKER: You
got actually--


323
0:12:18,62 --> 0:12:20,286
did you plan it out?


324
0:12:20,286 --> 0:12:20,96
ERIK ELLINGTON: No, no.


325
0:12:20,96 --> 0:12:23,78
We were like, well let's
just get married.


326
0:12:23,78 --> 0:12:25,3
Fuck it.


327
0:12:25,3 --> 0:12:27,28



328
0:12:27,28 --> 0:12:27,57
BRAYDON SZAFRANSKI: Check.


329
0:12:27,57 --> 0:12:29,43
One, two, one, two.


330
0:12:29,43 --> 0:12:32,69
What it is.


331
0:12:32,69 --> 0:12:34,84
Please get the stages of Erik.


332
0:12:34,84 --> 0:12:38,342
The drunken stages are by far
the best thing of him.


333
0:12:38,342 --> 0:12:39,825
Like, his skating, amazing.


334
0:12:39,825 --> 0:12:41,785
His life, amazing.


335
0:12:41,785 --> 0:12:44,29
Drunken stages, golden.


336
0:12:44,29 --> 0:12:45,432
First, OK.


337
0:12:45,432 --> 0:12:47,29
Like, I've seen him tonight.


338
0:12:47,29 --> 0:12:48,36
He has a button up shirt on.


339
0:12:48,36 --> 0:12:49,55
Great.


340
0:12:49,55 --> 0:12:52,12
So this is where you can
fully catch his stages.


341
0:12:52,12 --> 0:12:52,85
What'd he start with?


342
0:12:52,85 --> 0:12:55,8
Probably like five or
six buttons down it.


343
0:12:55,8 --> 0:12:56,98
You know what I mean?


344
0:12:56,98 --> 0:12:59,61
The more he drinks-- because
this is an open bar in here.


345
0:12:59,61 --> 0:13:2,52
The more he drinks, every
half an hour, a


346
0:13:2,52 --> 0:13:3,23
button will be popped.


347
0:13:3,23 --> 0:13:3,69
Bam.


348
0:13:3,69 --> 0:13:5,33
Easily.


349
0:13:5,33 --> 0:13:6,83
Was that a fourth button?


350
0:13:6,83 --> 0:13:7,67
ERIK ELLINGTON: That's
a fourth button.


351
0:13:7,67 --> 0:13:8,746
BRAYDON SZAFRANSKI: Did
I just see a fourth--


352
0:13:8,746 --> 0:13:10,174
I seen it.


353
0:13:10,174 --> 0:13:12,39
I actually witnessed it
with my own eyes.


354
0:13:12,39 --> 0:13:13,46
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Look, it fits
perfectly in there.


355
0:13:13,46 --> 0:13:14,34
Look, look, look.


356
0:13:14,34 --> 0:13:15,62
Look.


357
0:13:15,62 --> 0:13:18,2
BRAYDON SZAFRANSKI: Whoa, it
does fit perfectly in there.


358
0:13:18,2 --> 0:13:19,27
Whoa!


359
0:13:19,27 --> 0:13:21,47



360
0:13:21,47 --> 0:13:23,38
MALE SPEAKER: Don't do that.


361
0:13:23,38 --> 0:13:26,6
DUSTIN DOLLIN: Anyway, he's
basically my father.


362
0:13:26,6 --> 0:13:28,4
I don't have one.


363
0:13:28,4 --> 0:13:33,32
So he's pretty much the tough
guy I got to look up to.


364
0:13:33,32 --> 0:13:34,43
You know what you should do?


365
0:13:34,43 --> 0:13:37,7
You should do an episode
on all of our mothers.


366
0:13:37,7 --> 0:13:38,79
That would be a fucking--


367
0:13:38,79 --> 0:13:39,75
our mother--


368
0:13:39,75 --> 0:13:40,26
his father.


369
0:13:40,26 --> 0:13:42,17
Like, whoever we think's
weirdest in our family.


370
0:13:42,17 --> 0:13:43,48
BRAYDON SZAFRANSKI: Yeah,
everyone in the family that's


371
0:13:43,48 --> 0:13:44,73
just jacked.


372
0:13:44,73 --> 0:13:46,81



373
0:13:46,81 --> 0:13:48,29
ERIK ELLINGTON: Well, I'll
call you in a little bit.


374
0:13:48,29 --> 0:13:50,25
All right?


375
0:13:50,25 --> 0:13:52,21
All right.


376
0:13:52,21 --> 0:13:52,606
MALE SPEAKER: Luciana?


377
0:13:52,606 --> 0:13:54,96
ERIK ELLINGTON: Yeah.


378
0:13:54,96 --> 0:14:0,89
MALE SPEAKER: You had to get
permission for another night?


379
0:14:0,89 --> 0:14:3,26
ERIK ELLINGTON: Well, I didn't
really get permission.


380
0:14:3,26 --> 0:14:4,97
MALE SPEAKER: What'd she say?


381
0:14:4,97 --> 0:14:7,1
ERIK ELLINGTON: She's
just over it.


382
0:14:7,1 --> 0:14:11,17
Yeah, it's been like a lot
of nights in a row.


383
0:14:11,17 --> 0:14:13,57
I normally don't even
go out anymore.


384
0:14:13,57 --> 0:14:15,96
Me and her, we just chill
at the house, watch


385
0:14:15,96 --> 0:14:18,24
movies or do whatever.


386
0:14:18,24 --> 0:14:19,15
Damn.


387
0:14:19,15 --> 0:14:20,34
It's like, all this.


388
0:14:20,34 --> 0:14:21,53
This makes me so happy.


389
0:14:21,53 --> 0:14:24,5
My son makes me happy-- my wife,
my mom, my family, my


390
0:14:24,5 --> 0:14:25,44
friends, all that.


391
0:14:25,44 --> 0:14:28,36
But then it's just like, you
land something that you didn't


392
0:14:28,36 --> 0:14:29,49
think you could do
or something.


393
0:14:29,49 --> 0:14:30,47
And it's just like--


394
0:14:30,47 --> 0:14:33,23
I mean it's like the best--
gives you chills, you know?


395
0:14:33,23 --> 0:14:34,48
It's the best thing ever.


396
0:14:34,48 --> 0:14:37,59



397
0:14:37,59 --> 0:14:38,84
Give the camera a kiss.


398
0:14:38,84 --> 0:14:43,55



399
0:14:43,55 --> 0:14:44,45
Where'd you guys park?


400
0:14:44,45 --> 0:14:45,7
Down here?


401
0:14:45,7 --> 0:14:47,75



402
0:14:47,75 --> 0:14:50,15
One, two, three.


403
0:14:50,15 --> 0:14:51,4
Woo!


404
0:14:51,4 --> 0:16:51,4
