###108 - Ladies and gentlemen...
###114 When the Russian actress and dancer Natalya Dolzhenko
###119 made Salome in 1908,
###122 she wore a necklace made of magnificent pearls
###126 given to her by the czar.
###131 Last week, at an auction in Paris,
###134 I paid 300,000 francs for that same pearl necklace.
###142 My wife is going to show it to you now.
###161 - Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends,
###165 our new play premieres here at your beautiful theater
###170 next week, prior to a six-month tour of America.
###174 - Yes, Margaret is taking the leading part,
###177 and she will be wearing the czar's pearls
###180 at each and every performance.
###183 - Mr. Opalsen, don't the pearls get stolen
###187 in the course of the play?
###190 - Yes, they do.
###192 But that's in the play.
###193 They will be under guard 24 hours a day.
###198 I think I can promise you that they're not going anywhere.
###210 - Ah. Ah.
###211 - And again, please.
###214 - Ah.
###217 - Thank you.
###221 - Well, Doctor? Tell me.
###223 What is your diagnosis?
###226 - Well, essentially... - Yes?
###229 - You're run down.
###231 Even those famous gray cells of yours
###234 need an occasional rest.
###237 - It is true, Mr. Poirot.
###239 You've been taking on much too much recently.
###242 - Two weeks' complete rest.
###244 That's the answer.
###247 If I were you, I'd think of getting out of London.
###258 - This hotel, Hastings,
###260 it has, I hope, the full central heating.
###262 - Well, Miss Lemon said it had all the comforts.
###264 Now, where's a cab?
###267 Well, I must say, it's good to be out of London.
###270 Less traffic, for a start.
###273 - Less taxis also, it would appear.
###276 - Yes.
###277 - I know you.
###279 - It is possible, yes.
###280 - Your face been in the paper.
###282 - Yes, that is true, on many occasions.
###284 - You're Lucky Len, and I claim my ten guineas.
###292 I've got my paper, I said the right words,
###294 so where's my money?
###295 - Please. Do you mind?
###296 Grand Metropolitan Hotel, driver.
###298 - Right-o, guv.
###304 - It's a sort of game, Poirot.
###307 The newspaper prints a photograph
###308 of this character Lucky Len,
###310 and whoever finds him gets ten guineas.
###316 - This holiday, Hastings.
###318 Already, I begin to have the second thoughts.
###329 - Your key, Mr. Worthing.
###331 - Room 113?
###332 - Yes, sir.
###334 It's as you requested: on the first floor.
###337 - Good. Thank you.
###346 - I'll have your bags sent up, sir.
###359 - It is most curious, that, Hastings.
###361 Did you not remark? - What's what?
###363 - The gentleman that just booked in ahead of us.
###365 - Honestly, Poirot, you are incorrigible.
###368 - Mr. Poirot, isn't it?
###370 - Yes?
###371 - What a great privilege to have you here
###373 at the Grand Metropolitan.
###375 - Thank you.
###376 - Boy?
###377 - You got a nice sea view here.
###379 Bathroom through there.
###382 Two bedrooms.
###387 You going to the race?
###388 - Oh, we might.
###389 - I think not.
###390 - Laughing Boy in the 4:00, that's my tip.
###394 How about the theater?
###396 There's a new show opening this week.
###398 I can get you tickets.
###399 - Hastings?
###401 - Well, I reckon you'd enjoy it, sir,
###403 you being a detective and that.
###405 They got a necklace worth a bundle onstage.
###408 - Yes, I read about that.
###409 - Mr. Opalsen, the producer, he's staying here too,
###413 him and his wife.
###414 Oh, thank you, sir.
###419 - Un moment, s'il vous plait.
###423 This Monsieur Opalsen,
###425 would you happen to know which is his room?
###427 - Poirot.
###428 - Yes, of course I do, sir.
###430 The Imperial Suite, number 114.
###433 Just here, sir.
###435 - Merci.
###444 - Ah, here we are, Laughing Boy in the 4:00.
###447 Seven to one.
###448 Perhaps I will have a try.
###452 - Mr. Poirot--
###454 - I hope you'll forgive me, Mr. Poirot,
###456 but when I heard that the famous detective
###457 was staying at the hotel, I just had to meet him.
###460 - Mr. Poirot, this is Mr. Opalsen,
###461 the producer.
###463 - Ah, yes, of course.
###465 Monsieur Opalsen.
###467 My associate, Captain Hastings, and myself
###469 have already heard much about your production.
###471 Will you join us?
###472 - Thank you.
###473 Yes, Pearls Before Swine.
###477 It opens tonight.
###479 I'd be honored if you'd come as my guests.
###482 And to the party afterwards?
###484 - Oh, that's jolly decent of you.
###488 - And it is tonight, I think,
###489 that your famous necklace makes also its debut.
###492 - Yes, the maid's just taking it to the theater now.
###495 Celestine, show Mr. Poirot the pearls.
###503 Well, get them out of the box.
###504 - I can't, sir.
###506 I don't have the key.
###508 - Why not, damn it? Where'd you put it?
###511 - Mr. Opalsen keeps it, sir.
###513 She insists.
###514 - Ugh. Security.
###518 - You carry the necklace on your own?
###520 - No, sir.
###522 - No, Saunders, my driver, always goes with her.
###525 As a matter of fact, he's late.
###527 - Then perhaps you will permit Captain Hastings and myself
###531 to accompany la mademoiselle.
###532 - Well, that's very kind.
###534 - Not at all.
###535 It is our pleasure, is it not, Hastings?
###536 - Oh, rather.
###542 - Margaret?
###543 Now, listen, dear.
###545 You'll never guess who I've just met.
###548 Yup.
###549 It's Poirot, Hercule Poirot.
###552 He's on his way over now.
###554 I know.
###555 That's right.
###556 We're going to have to do something.
###564 - Mademoiselle, your name of Celestine,
###566 it is French, n'est-ce pas?
###568 - My mother was French, sir,
###570 but I've always lived here.
###572 I was hoping to be in the theater myself one day.
###575 - Ah.
###576 And you have been working with Monsieur Opalsen
###578 for how long?
###579 - About two years.
###581 He's not normally so edgy, sir.
###583 It's just when there's a first night.
###585 - Have you seen Pearls Before Swine?
###587 - Only in rehearsal, but it's beautifully written.
###591 I'm sure Mr. Opalsen has nothing to worry--
###593 - Stop!
###596 Stop.
###598 You are Lucky Len of the Daily Echo,
###601 and I claim my ten guineas.
###603 - No, madame, I am not Len.
###605 And, therefore, for you, I am not lucky.
###607 Excuse me.
###620 - Here we are.
###621 We can go in the back way.
###625 - All right, where is it?
###628 - Let me go!
###629 - The money.
###630 - Look, you'll have it.
###632 - When?
###633 - Tomorrow.
###634 - You said that yesterday.
###635 - No!
###639 - Tomorrow.
###640 - I promise you.
###641 - Andrew!
###642 - Tomorrow, then, or else.
###645 - Give me the bag, mademoiselle.
###650 - Are you all right?
###652 - Fine.
###654 They haven't hurt me.
###657 My God, you're Hercule Poirot, aren't you?
###660 - Oui.
###661 It would appear that you are in need of assistance, monsieur.
###664 - Me?
###665 No, no, those are just
###668 what you might call business associates.
###672 It's nothing I can't handle.
###673 - This is Andrew Hall,
###675 the writer I was telling you about.
###677 - Ah, Monsieur Hall.
###679 - So it's your play.
###681 - It's Ed Opalsen's play.
###684 He bought it, cut it, rewrote it,
###685 and left me with about 2% of it.
###687 Hence my current difficulties.
###689 - Are you sure you're all right?
###692 - Yes.
###693 - I have to go in.
###694 - I'll come with you.
###696 - Thank you, Mr. Poirot.
###698 - Mademoiselle.
###709 You know, Hastings,
###711 I begin, I think, to look forward to this play.
###714 - Glad to hear it.
###716 - Thank you.
###720 - I'll go.
###722 - Thank you, Hastings.
###727 - Ah.
###728 - Mr. Poirot?
###729 - I am Poirot.
###731 - Ah.
###733 My name is Saunders, sir.
###735 Mr. Opalsen's chauffeur.
###737 - Yes?
###738 - Mr. Opalsen has sent me to take you to the theater, sir,
###741 with his compliments.
###743 - Thank you.
###749 - Here he comes.
###750 Mr. Poirot? - Mr. Poirot.
###752 Have you been challenged to solve the play, sir?
###754 - This I do not believe. Hastings!
###756 - Mr. Poirot, how many acts do you think it will take?
###759 - Excuse me!
###760 It is an outrage, Hastings,
###762 to use Hercule Poirot for the publicity of this play.
###764 - Absolutely.
###765 It's beginning.
###768 - Inspector Drake should be here pretty soon.
###771 - Oh, is Inspector Drake really coming here?
###775 I've read so much about him in the newspapers.
###777 - Oh, yes, Inspector Drake and I have worked together
###780 quite a lot recently.
###782 - Good luck, my dear.
###783 - And you're a mere local sergeant.
###786 Oh, here's Inspector Drake coming now.
###788 Shh! Good evening, sir.
###790 My lady will be here presently.
###792 - Good. I must speak to her at once.
###794 - My dear inspector.
###798 - Forgive me, Lady Jane,
###800 but I don't think you should be wearing that.
###803 - The necklace? Whyever not?
###806 - Because the Phantom has sworn to have it,
###811 and the Phantom has never once failed.
###818 - I think it's about time
###819 we made an appearance at the party.
###822 Well, you're not going to wear the pearls?
###824 - I'm tired of being upstaged by them.
###827 Celestine.
###828 - Yes, Mrs. Opalsen.
###830 - Is it safe just leaving them there?
###833 - Of course. Celestine won't leave the room.
###835 - More champagne? - No, thank you.
###839 - I don't see why you don't wear the pearls.
###841 It's good publicity.
###842 - That's all you ever think about.
###844 Now, you heard what I said, didn't you, Celestine?
###846 - Yes, mum.
###848 - I'll have your supper sent up to you.
###850 There.
###862 - Come on, then.
###863 Time to play host and hostess.
###877 - Thank you.
###884 - I hope you enjoy the party, sir.
###886 - Thank you.
###887 Oh, pardon. You will forgive me?
###889 - Oh.
###891 Thank you very much, sir.
###893 - Not at all.
###897 - I'll be waiting for you here, sir.
###899 - Thank you.
###906 - Who is it?
###907 - Maid, mum. Got your supper for you.
###909 - One moment.
###913 That's very kind of you.
###914 - All part of the service.
###915 Do you want me to carry it in?
###917 - Yes, put it over there.
###921 - All on your own, are you?
###922 - Yes.
###923 - That's a shame.
###925 All the rest of them at the party.
###927 Tell you what.
###928 I'll sit with you, if you like.
###933 - Thank you.
###935 My name's Grace, Grace Wilson.
###937 So how do you like the Grand Metropolitan?
###940 - Let us say it was an evening I shall not easily forget.
###942 - Ah, Mr. Poirot.
###944 - Excuse me.
###945 - I'm delighted you could make it.
###947 - Monsieur. Madame.
###949 Monsieur Opalsen, at the theater this evening,
###952 there were some journalists awaiting me.
###954 This was not, I think, a coincidence.
###956 - Uh, no.
###958 But a man in my position needs all the publicity he can get.
###961 - I bet you'd guessed who'd stolen the pearls
###964 by the second interval, Monsieur Poirot.
###966 - Not at all, madame.
###967 It was a question that ceased to occupy my mind
###970 long before the first.
###972 Excuse me.
###976 - They're not really that bad.
###978 - Oh, you should try this job.
###979 I could tell you a thing or two.
###981 - Have you worked here long?
###983 - Not here, no...
###1006 - Mr. Poirot.
###1008 Hubert Devine.
###1010 I played the detective, Drake.
###1013 - Ah, yes, of course.
###1014 I found your performance most engaging.
###1018 - It's a jolly good play.
###1019 - Yes, I think it's going to be a success.
###1022 And just as well.
###1024 Dear Ed needs a winner.
###1027 Well, three disasters last season.
###1030 He only had one success, and that was a revival.
###1033 Oh, yes.
###1037 If Pearls doesn't run,
###1040 I'd say he was finished.
###1047 - I do like these telegrams.
###1050 They're really nice.
###1052 They always send them? - Mm.
###1053 Oh, I need some scissors.
###1056 - I can get you some, if you like.
###1059 - No, it's all right; I've got some somewhere.
###1061 Oh, I hate sewing.
###1066 - Good night. Thank you.
###1067 - Did you enjoy yourself, sir?
###1069 - Yes, thank you, Saunders.
###1071 But now, you know, the fatigue.
###1072 - Well, it is after midnight.
###1074 - Yes, indeed, Hastings.
###1075 Thank you.
###1081 - We're back, Celestine.
###1083 Everything all right?
###1084 - Yes, mum. Everything's fine.
###1086 - What a dreary party.
###1088 - Well, you weren't exactly glittering yourself, my dear.
###1092 - And you drank too much.
###1094 - Why not? I paid for it.
###1096 - Celestine, my jewelry box.
###1099 - Yes, mum.
###1103 - That damn writer Andrew Hall didn't even bother to show up.
###1106 - I saw him leave the theater.
###1109 He was avoiding you.
###1110 - Are you inferring something?
###1111 - No.
###1113 Here's the key.
###1115 Are you still drinking?
###1117 - Yes. Do you want one?
###1123 - Sir?
###1126 Mrs. Opalsen.
###1127 - What is it?
###1130 - The necklace.
###1133 I don't understand it. It's not here.
###1136 - What do you mean, it's not there?
###1137 It's got to be.
###1138 - Out of the way. Let me look.
###1143 For heaven's sake.
###1145 Call the police.
###1147 Someone has stolen my pearls!
###1156 - I take it, Monsieur Opalsen,
###1159 that you have summoned the police?
###1165 - Yes, of course.
###1167 They're sending someone down from London.
###1169 But that's not good enough.
###1170 I want you, Mr. Poirot.
###1173 - Ah.
###1174 - I beg of you. I've got to get them back.
###1181 - And these pearls, they were, without doubt,
###1186 insured?
###1187 - Well, yes, but-- but that's not the point.
###1192 The play, Mr. Poirot,
###1194 all the publicity about the pearls.
###1197 If they aren't returned, I'll be a laughingstock.
###1199 We have an American tour.
###1200 How can we do Pearls Before Swine with no pearls?
###1204 - Poirot?
###1205 - Excuse me.
###1206 Mon cher Hastings?
###1208 - The doctor. - Comment?
###1209 - I just think you ought to remember why you're here.
###1213 - Yes, that is true.
###1215 But, Hastings--
###1224 Monsieur Opalsen,
###1227 I regret that Poirot cannot help you in this matter.
###1232 - What?
###1234 - I am here
###1237 en vacances.
###1245 - Ah, morning, Poirot.
###1247 - Bonjour, Chief Inspector Japp.
###1256 - Imperial Suite, please.
###1263 - I took the necklace off before the party
###1266 and put it in my jewelry box.
###1268 And then I put the box in the drawer.
###1271 - Was the drawer locked?
###1274 - No, it wasn't.
###1275 Celestine was here, so I felt there was no need.
###1280 - How many keys are there to this box, Mrs. Opalsen?
###1283 - Only one, and I keep it with me all the time.
###1287 - You're sure of that?
###1288 It doesn't seem to have been forced.
###1290 - Of course I'm sure.
###1293 There's only ever been one key.
###1302 - I'm going to offer a reward, Chief Inspector, a big one.
###1306 You think that'll help?
###1307 - It may, sir.
###1312 So what were you doing when all this was going on?
###1316 - I was doing the sewing, sir.
###1319 I only went into the side room...
###1323 The first time for scissors and later for thread.
###1329 - Look at the little boats over there.
###1339 - Oh, cheer up, Poirot.
###1341 It is for the best.
###1343 - I have no doubt, Hastings.
###1345 - Well, you're here for a rest.
###1347 If you're going to get involved in another case,
###1349 you might just as well have stayed in London.
###1351 - It is true.
###1353 - I don't know why you can't just sit back
###1355 and enjoy the sea air.
###1361 - I know you.
###1362 - No, no, no, Hastings.
###1364 It is no use.
###1365 Not to take this case is, for Poirot,
###1366 more hard work than to take it.
###1375 - Saunders, get the car started.
###1377 I'm in a hurry.
###1378 - Monsieur Hall. - What?
###1380 Oh, um, Mr. Poirot.
###1382 I'm afraid I can't stop.
###1383 - You've heard, then, about the pearls?
###1385 - Yes.
###1386 What was it about life imitating art?
###1388 Serves Ed right.
###1389 Anyway, it's not my problem.
###1392 - Monsieur Hall?
###1393 I noticed that you were not at the party last night.
###1395 - Well, I wasn't in a party mood.
###1397 - May I ask where you were?
###1399 - I went for a walk.
###1400 Now, if you'll excuse me, I really will be late.
###1403 Thank you, Saunders.
###1413 - I only stayed with her 'cause I felt sorry for her.
###1416 - So you were alone in the room with the necklace.
###1418 - Yeah, for about two seconds.
###1421 Didn't even know it was there.
###1422 Blooming cheek.
###1424 - Chief Inspector?
###1426 - Ah, hello, Poirot.
###1428 - Excuse us, mademoiselle.
###1429 - Thought you were sitting this one out.
###1431 - Well-- - No, no, no, no, no, no.
###1434 So how goes the investigation?
###1436 - Pretty routine.
###1437 - Have you got any more questions?
###1439 I've got a ton of work.
###1440 - Oh, no, that's all right, Miss Wilson.
###1442 That's all for now.
###1446 Grace Wilson.
###1448 Been with the hotel a couple of months.
###1449 Barmaid before that, Dog and Duck in Holborn.
###1453 She took that girl Celestine her supper.
###1456 First floor, please.
###1459 - So tell me, Chief Inspector.
###1461 What is it that you have so far found out?
###1469 - Grace Wilson or Celestine.
###1471 The hotel maid or the ladies' maid.
###1474 Seems to me it's got to be one of them.
###1475 - A necklace in a box within a chest, Chief Inspector,
###1478 and only one key?
###1480 It is as a magical trick.
###1492 The necklace, it was in this drawer?
###1495 - That's right.
###1499 - And this door?
###1501 - Oh, that leads to the maid's room.
###1502 That's where Celestine went to get the scissors and thread.
###1505 - Leaving Grace alone in the room.
###1508 - Tell me, Hastings, how long do you think
###1510 it would have taken Mademoiselle Celestine
###1512 to retrieve the scissors from that room?
###1514 - Oh, I don't know. 20 seconds?
###1517 - 20 seconds.
###1519 And for how much of that time
###1520 would she have been out of this room?
###1522 - Four or five seconds at the most.
###1525 - Exactement.
###1529 And for Mademoiselle Grace Wilson
###1531 to open this drawer, remove the box,
###1533 somehow to unlock it, open the box,
###1535 take out the necklace, close the box,
###1537 and return it?
###1539 - Well, she couldn't possibly have had time.
###1541 - I do not think so.
###1543 - Right.
###1545 Excuse me.
###1547 - Where are you going, Chief Inspector?
###1549 - I think it's about time I had Miss Celestine searched.
###1555 - Can't imagine why they didn't lock it.
###1564 - This drawer runs easily, Hastings.
###1569 But not this one.
###1580 C'est interessant.
###1583 I wonder...
###1589 - Well, that must interconnect with the room next door.
###1592 - It is bolted.
###1600 Bolted on both sides.
###1602 But, Hastings, we know who it is who occupies this room.
###1606 - Room 113?
###1609 - Oui.
###1610 His name, I think, was Mr. Worthing.
###1614 - That's right, sir.
###1615 He was an American gent.
###1616 He only stayed the night.
###1617 Left this morning.
###1620 - You saw him depart?
###1622 - Oh, no, sir.
###1623 Carried his own luggage.
###1625 Must have left at the crack of dawn.
###1628 - You did not, by chance, see him yesterday evening?
###1631 - No, sir.
###1634 I can tell you who I did see, though, sir.
###1637 Well, it was just as I was leaving.
###1639 Well, I don't want to talk out of turn, sir,
###1642 but, well, if there's a reward and all that, well...
###1646 - Please to continue.
###1648 - Yeah.
###1649 Well, that writer, Mr. Hall,
###1651 he was hanging around outside the hotel.
###1653 Must have been about 11:00.
###1658 - Outside? - Yes, sir.
###1666 - Would he have been near to the window
###1668 of Monsieur and Madame Opalsen?
###1670 - Well, yes, sir.
###1673 Right under it.
###1675 - Thank you.
###1690 - Well.
###1691 Now, here's something that shouldn't be here.
###1705 - That's a duplicate key to the jewel box.
###1707 We found it hidden in the hem of Celestine's petticoat.
###1711 - Sounds pretty conclusive.
###1713 But what about the necklace?
###1715 - No sign of that yet.
###1716 - Going up, ladies and gentlemen.
###1718 - But if you say her boyfriend was seen
###1722 outside the hotel last night...
###1727 - Monsieur Hall? He was here, yes.
###1729 - Yes, well, that explains it, doesn't it?
###1731 - Explains what?
###1733 - How she got the necklace out of the hotel.
###1735 She couldn't leave the room,
###1736 so she simply dropped it out of the window,
###1738 and he was there to catch it.
###1739 - You have arrested Mademoiselle Celestine?
###1741 - Yes, and the sooner we find Andrew Hall, the better.
###1750 Ah, Mr. Saunders.
###1752 We want a word with you.
###1757 - I hear you've already solved the case, sir.
###1760 - Never mind about that. Have you seen Mr. Hall?
###1763 - Mr. Hall, sir?
###1764 I drove him to the race course.
###1767 Is he in some sort of trouble, sir?
###1769 - He could be in a lot of trouble.
###1770 Why do you ask?
###1772 - Well, he did seem a little anxious.
###1776 - I'm not surprised.
###1778 Have you any idea where we might find him?
###1780 - Well, he always places his bets with the same man,
###1785 Harry Wax.
###1787 - Harry Wax?
###1790 - He's a bookie, sir.
###1813 - Just the sort of place I'd expect him to go.
###1815 - What do you mean, Chief Inspector?
###1816 - A race course.
###1818 This is where you'll find every criminal element, Poirot.
###1821 And what better place to do this kind of business
###1823 than in the middle of a crowd?
###1824 I only hope we're not too late.
###1826 We've got all the entrances covered?
###1827 - Yes, sir. - Right.
###1828 You lot come with me,
###1830 and keep your eyes out for a bookie called Harry Wax.
###1832 All right, come on, lads.
###1833 - Hastings, this is wrong.
###1835 To Poirot, it makes no sense.
###1839 - 45, 50,
###1843 55, 60.
###1846 - Next race is the...
###1848 - Take six to four, This Favorite,
###1850 and four to one Balwon.
###1853 Take six to...
###1859 Take six to four--
###1874 - You Harry Wax? - Yeah.
###1876 - Is there a tall, blond-haired chap
###1877 made a bet this morning?
###1882 - Poirot!
###1887 There's Mr. Worthing. I could have sworn it.
###1890 - Oi!
###1893 There he is!
###1898 Halt!
###1906 - You can't come in here.
###1910 - Stop him! Stop him!
###1915 Get him!
###1919 - Come on.
###1924 - Right. Get him in the car.
###1926 - All right, in the car. Come on.
###1928 - I'm afraid we got to him just too late.
###1930 But we found this and this.
###1933 - The pearls.
###1934 - No, just the pouch they were kept in.
###1936 Empty.
###1937 - So what's happened to the pearls?
###1973 - You've got it all wrong, Chief Inspector.
###1975 - Ah, so I suppose you won this lot on a horse, did you?
###1979 - Yes.
###1981 Laughing Boy came in at seven to one.
###1983 - Then why did you try and run for it when you saw me?
###1985 - I owe money.
###1988 I've had a bad run
###1989 and fell in with some pretty bad company.
###1991 Well, you saw what they were like
###1993 outside the theater.
###1994 - Yes.
###1998 - I didn't know who you were, so...
###2002 - How do you explain this?
###2012 - I can't.
###2013 I've never seen it before.
###2015 - It was in your pocket.
###2016 - Then somebody must have put it there.
###2019 - Chief Inspector?
###2023 Monsieur Hall.
###2027 Why did you not go to the party of Monsieur Opalsen?
###2030 - I've told you.
###2032 I went for a walk.
###2034 - And your walk took you back to the Grand Metropolitan Hotel.
###2040 - Yes.
###2046 I wanted to see Celestine.
###2050 I just needed to be with her.
###2051 But then, when I saw she wasn't alone,
###2057 I went to bed.
###2067 - Mr. Poirot, you've got to believe me.
###2070 I'd never seen that key before.
###2072 Someone must have hidden it there.
###2074 - Now, now, now, now, now, mon petit.
###2077 Tell me, about Monsieur Hall,
###2079 you know of his gambling?
###2082 - Yes.
###2084 I've tried to stop him, but it's no good.
###2088 It's like a disease.
###2090 - And you are aware, mademoiselle,
###2091 that for the return of these pearls,
###2093 Monsieur Opalsen is offering a reward most substantial?
###2096 - Yes.
###2098 But I didn't take them, Mr. Poirot, I swear to you.
###2101 - But nobody else came into the room while you were there.
###2105 - No,
###2108 only the hotel maid.
###2110 - Tell me, Mademoiselle Celestine.
###2113 Monsieur Hall, how did you first meet?
###2119 - It was at the theater.
###2121 One of Mr. Opalsen's productions.
###2124 An Oscar Wilde.
###2126 - Lady Windermere's Fan?
###2128 - No.
###2132 It was The Importance of Being Earnest.
###2137 - Of course.
###2145 Hastings, I must contact the good Miss Lemon in London.
###2148 - What for?
###2149 - This case, Hastings, I begin to see the light.
###2151 - I don't understand.
###2152 - You heard what the young lady said.
###2154 - Oscar Wilde?
###2155 - Exactement.
###2157 Hastings, there is work to be done.
###2182 - Left to get married about six months ago.
###2185 - Really?
###2202 - Good shooting, Chief Inspector.
###2203 - I used to go out on Isleworth Marshes
###2205 when I was a boy.
###2207 Some things you never forget.
###2209 - Well, I must say, it's nice to have an evening off.
###2211 - What's Poirot up to, then?
###2212 - Thinking.
###2214 - Oh.
###2215 - This was meant to be a rest, you know.
###2217 Heaven knows what Miss Lemon's going to say when she arrives.
###2221 - Hello, sir.
###2222 Evening, Chief Inspector.
###2224 - Hello, Miss Wilson.
###2225 - It's nice to see the police is human too.
###2227 That for your little boy?
###2230 - Yes.
###2231 - I'm glad I ran into you.
###2232 There's something I was wanting to tell you.
###2234 - Oh, yes? What's that?
###2235 - Well, it may not mean nothing, but it's that writer.
###2238 - What about him?
###2240 - Well, I saw him in Mr. Opalsen's room
###2242 day before that necklace got swiped.
###2245 He was there when I did the cleaning.
###2246 Said he was looking for something,
###2248 but I don't know.
###2249 Anyway...
###2250 - The day before.
###2264 - Mr. Poirot?
###2266 - Ah, Miss Lemon.
###2268 Allow me to take your case.
###2269 - Thank you.
###2278 - Good morning, Miss Lemon.
###2282 - I thought this was meant to be a holiday,
###2285 Captain Hastings.
###2286 I'll talk to you later.
###2289 - Poirot?
###2296 What are you up to, Poirot?
###2297 - Chief Inspector, you must make an immediate arrest.
###2301 - I've already made an arrest, thank you very much.
###2303 - Chief Inspector, what if this case
###2305 was not just a question of theft but of fraud?
###2308 And what also if the pearls of the czar
###2311 did not exist?
###2313 - There's Mr. Opalsen.
###2315 Can we have a statement, please, sir?
###2317 Can we have a statement?
###2319 - Make a statement, Chief Inspector.
###2320 - Mr. Opalsen?
###2322 - Poirot!
###2323 How dare you?
###2325 - But, Monsieur Opalsen,
###2327 a man in your position needs all the publicity he can get.
###2332 - Mr. Opalsen.
###2334 - Could you tell us what's going on, sir?
###2335 - Following our investigations, we discovered
###2337 that the necklace that was stolen was a fake.
###2339 There never were any real pearls.
###2341 - You mean he did it for the insurance,
###2342 Chief Inspector?
###2343 - We are now investigating the possibility
###2345 of an insurance fraud.
###2346 That's all I can tell you for the present.
###2348 Thank you.
###2349 - One more question, sir.
###2351 What made you think the pearls were fake?
###2354 - Mr. Opalsen? - Mr. Opalsen.
###2364 - Oh, yes, Inspector Drake and I have worked together
###2366 quite a lot recently.
###2367 - Oh, here's Inspector Drake coming now.
###2369 Shh! Shh! Good evening, sir.
###2371 My lady will be here presently.
###2373 - My dear Inspector.
###2375 - Forgive me, Lady Jane,
###2377 but I don't think you should be wearing that.
###2383 - The necklace?
###2384 Whyever not?
###2386 - Because the Phantom has sworn he'll have it.
###2391 And the Phantom has never once failed.
###2396 - Poirot.
###2397 Why did you want to see the play again?
###2400 - Tomorrow the play travels to New York, mon ami.
###2404 - Yes?
###2405 - Miss Lemon has yet to see a performance.
###2407 - Shh!
###2408 - I mean to have him.
###2421 - Good night, sir.
###2438 - What are we doing here, Poirot?
###2441 The play is finished.
###2443 - The play, it has finished, yes, Hastings.
###2447 But there is still one more act.
###2451 - I don't understand.
###2452 - Ah, mon cher Hastings,
###2453 the pearls so celebrated of the czar,
###2456 where do you think a market could be found for them?
###2458 - Well, I don't know.
###2460 Somewhere on the Continent, I suppose.
###2462 - No, no, no, Hastings.
###2463 And that is what Miss Lemon discovered for me in London.
###2466 - They're just too well known over here.
###2468 No one would touch them.
###2469 - In America, then?
###2471 - Exactement.
###2473 And with everyone searching for them,
###2475 what would be the best way to smuggle them abroad?
###2485 - Well, of course, in among the scenery and props
###2488 for the play.
###2489 - Oui.
###2490 - You mean they're here somewhere?
###2492 - Oui.
###2493 - Well, where?
###2494 And who put them here?
###2496 - This case, it has been most curious,
###2498 n'est-ce pas, Chief Inspector?
###2500 From the start, there were only two people
###2504 who could possibly have stolen those pearls
###2505 of Monsieur Opalsen:
###2507 Mademoiselle Celestine
###2510 or Mademoiselle Grace Wilson, the hotel maid.
###2514 - Well, it must have been Celestine.
###2515 She had the key.
###2516 It was sewn into her petticoat.
###2518 - It has always puzzled me, that, Hastings.
###2521 Why keep the key?
###2522 It was so needless, so clumsy.
###2524 - Are you saying it was planted?
###2526 - Yes, of course.
###2528 - Well, if it wasn't Celestine, it must have been Grace.
###2531 But we know that she didn't have time to take the pearls.
###2533 You said so yourself.
###2535 - It is a riddle, is it not, Hastings?
###2536 - So which of them was it?
###2545 - Let us imagine.
###2549 Mademoiselle Grace Wilson is in the room of Monsieur Opalsen.
###2554 She is there only to be friendly.
###2556 - I can get you some, if you like.
###2557 - No, it's all right.
###2558 - The moment that Mademoiselle Celestine
###2560 leaves the room to retrieve the scissors,
###2562 as quick as a flash, she acts.
###2573 She was able to execute the theft of the pearls
###2576 in an instant,
###2577 because she did not need to unlock the box herself.
###2580 She had in the adjoining room an accomplice
###2583 with a duplicate key,
###2585 and it was he who removed the pouch and the pearls.
###2593 - Mr. Worthing.
###2596 - Exactement, Hastings.
###2599 And when Mademoiselle Celestine leaves the room
###2601 for the second time, this time for some thread,
###2604 the box, it is returned in exactly the same manner.
###2611 Only now, the necklace, it has gone.
###2616 - And I suppose it was this mysterious Mr. Worthing
###2619 who hid the key in Celestine's petticoat.
###2622 - He or his accomplice, Chief Inspector, yes.
###2625 But it was definitely Monsieur Worthing
###2629 who placed into the pocket of Monsieur Hall
###2630 the pouch which was empty.
###2634 - Poirot!
###2635 That's right.
###2636 I saw him at the race course.
###2637 There's Mr. Worthing. I could have sworn it.
###2640 But who is he?
###2642 Who is this Mr. Worthing?
###2653 Mr. Poirot.
###2654 - Shh.
###2659 - Shh. Wait there.
###2688 - It is a pleasure to meet you at last,
###2691 Mr. Worthing.
###2700 - Saunders.
###2705 - Let go!
###2707 Get off me! I done nothing wrong!
###2709 Let go of me!
###2711 Oh, God.
###2724 You bloody fool.
###2726 I told you we shouldn't ought to have come.
###2728 - But I think it is too late for that, Madame Saunders.
###2731 - Madame--what, you mean they're married?
###2734 - Yes, of course, Chief Inspector.
###2736 It was that that Miss Lemon discovered for me
###2738 at the Dog and the Duck in Holborn.
###2739 - Grace Saunders.
###2741 The landlord remembered her well.
###2743 - But why the disguise?
###2746 - Ah, Hastings.
###2749 How else could Monsieur Saunders reserve for himself
###2751 a room next door to Monsieur Opalsen?
###2754 He had to assume a new identity.
###2758 - How could you possibly know?
###2761 - As ever, Monsieur, it was the little details,
###2765 the matters of no consequence
###2767 that caught the attention of Poirot.
###2769 You will recall, Hastings, on the night of the theft,
###2773 that I remarked on some white powder
###2774 on the sleeve of Monsieur Saunders.
###2776 Pardon. You will forgive me?
###2780 - I thought it was talcum powder.
###2782 - Thank you very much, sir. - Not at all.
###2784 No, Hastings, it was not the talcum powder.
###2786 It was the French chalk, which cabinetmaker use
###2789 to let the drawers made of wood run more smoothly
###2792 and with which Monsieur Worthing prepared beforehand
###2794 the drawer containing the pearls.
###2799 But I was suspicious of Mr. Worthing
###2802 long before this.
###2803 - Your key, Mr. Worthing.
###2805 - When Hastings and myself,
###2806 we first came to the Grand Metropolitan Hotel,
###2808 there was a man at the desk.
###2810 He was elderly. He must walk with a stick.
###2814 - Thank you.
###2815 - But when he goes to his room, which is on the first floor,
###2819 he proceeds not to the lift that is waiting, no,
###2822 but to the staircase.
###2831 It was a performance, Monsieur,
###2833 but a performance that, to Poirot, did not ring true.
###2840 - Damn you.
###2842 - That's enough of that.
###2843 Take him away.
###2854 - One thing, Poirot.
###2855 I know you were waiting for them,
###2857 but why did you think they'd come here?
###2858 - They came here, Hastings, to retrieve the necklace.
###2861 - I see.
###2865 Where is the necklace?
###2867 - The necklace, Hastings?
###2870 It is, I think...
###2895 Voila.
###2902 - Damn Poirot!
###2905 You mean that bloody little man set me up?
###2908 - It's your own fault.
###2910 You tried to use him.
###2911 - But, Margaret, what about the pearls?
###2913 - Don't worry.
###2915 That "bloody little man" got them back.
###2929 - So you made up the story about the fake pearls
###2932 to smoke out the thieves.
###2934 - Hmm.
###2935 So now you learn the plot of your next play,
###2937 Monsieur Hall.
###2939 Yes, I told to them that the necklace, it was false,
###2942 because I knew that they would then have to examine it.
###2944 - We're all packed, Mr. Poirot.
###2946 - Thank you, Miss Lemon.
###2947 - The reward, Mr. Poirot.
###2949 It should be yours.
###2950 Why have you given it to me?
###2952 - Because, Mademoiselle,
###2953 it was you who told to me the title of the play
###2956 The Importance of Being Earnest.
###2959 And there is in that play a character
###2961 that is very well known who is called...
###2964 - Jack Worthing.
###2965 - C'est ca.
###2966 And it was then that I saw the light.
###2969 So the reward, I think, must be for you.
###2976 Miss Lemon? Hastings?
###2990 - So much for your holiday, Mr. Poirot.
###2993 - But, Miss Lemon, I feel completely refreshed.
###2995 - Even so, this wasn't what the doctor ordered.
###2997 - Daily Echo! Daily Echo!
###3005 - You are Lucky Len of the Daily Echo,
###3007 and I claim my ten guineas.
###3009 - You're right. I was Lucky Len.
###3012 But I'm sorry; I got fired this morning.
###3015 - Fired? Why?
###3017 - Too many people were recognizing me.
###3019 The paper decided it must be my face.
###3022 It's too common.
###3024 - Common?
###3025 - That's what they said.
###3026 Bit of a cheek, if you ask me.
###3028 But there you are.
###3029 - They are wrong, mon ami.
###3031 You have a face that is most distinguished.
###3033 You have no need to work for this newspaper.
###3037 You have a face of a great man.
###3040 - You think so?
###3041 - Oh, yes.
###3042 I know it.
