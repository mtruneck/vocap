###3 The science of communication does not exist actually, there is no science of communication
###12 as of yet, although to a limitted extent, we do communicate, but communication is misunderstood.
###23 For example, if a price desires a particular woman, he may send her a gift, the expense
###34 of that gift determines to what extent that women will yeild to the prince, so that's
###44 a form of communication. You ask an ordinary man to repair your roof, he might say "no".
###52 If you offer him 20 dollars an hour, he might say maybe. If you offer him 30 dollars an
###60 hour, he says "when do you want me to start?" So money can be a mechanism that affects human
###68 behavior. Ultimately, communication was a means of trying to affect human behavior.
###78 A woman that can operate a sawing machine quite well can not communicate with a physiologist.
###86 Only to a limitted extent. So communication, in the society where there are multiplicity
###97 of different reactions and different values, does not assure communication. You understand
###105 what that means? You have problems with that? Ok. So, if a man is very good with a bow and
###115 arrow, in order to serve his tribe, he might train others to use the bow and arrow efficiently.
###123 Now when people fly an airplane today, they try to aim the missile at an airplane. If
###133 someone designs a heat seeking missile, that goes up the hot end of an airplane, or the
###140 exhaust port, they don't need to aim or develop a training program for that. You merely release
###150 the missile and it seeks heat. If you released a missile and it seeked the human body, you
###158 don't need to train people to aim. So communication, to a limitted extent, has to do with the state
###166 of technology today. Do you understand? Communication as a system, is always undergoing change.
###175 Now if you sit there and say "well what is communication?" well in essense, you want
###184 control the behavior of another person. That's what you say "I'll see ya Wednesday" Wednesday
###191 means the same thing to the other person, but if it's a forgeiner he says "what means
###197 Wednesday?" So you have to find out what that means. So when people set out to communicate,
###205 they set out to share language, and that all depends on what the rewards are, for a certain
###216 behavior. If you have a certain philosophy, and you're a ruler of a certain country, and
###222 someone offers you 2 million dollars, you may sell your country short, if they deposit
###231 2 million in the bank, so the 2 million dollars is a method of persuasion, or communication.
###235 Do you understand that? That's why it's not possible, in a monetary system, where there
###244 are certain ways of gaining advantage. If the communication takes away your advantage,
###254 there's no need for you to learn that kind of communication. If you're head of the Catholic
###260 church and the Presperterian church becomes dominant in your community, there's no basis
###266 for you learning about that, because it takes away your job. So in a monetary system where
###275 rewards vary, it's very difficult to establish communication. That's why people that come
###283 from different cultures, can not communicate, except to a limitted extent. If one Indian
###290 tribe has a different philosophy than another, the may not want to communicate, cause it
###297 may upset the conduct of people in the tribe, but if a common enemy appears, then the tribes
###306 might merge temporarily, to defeat the common enemy, but they don't sit down and communicate.
###315 They communicate - their communication is maintaining positions of differential advantage.
###321 They do not seek to communicate, they seek to maintain those positions. Now there's many
###330 scientists that say "yes, we're interested in developing a means of communication" but
###337 even scientists have vested interest, so their communication is affected by vested interest.
###348 Nobodies so pure as to say, "I seek pure communication" you'd have to forget all about your culture,
###356 advantages and living in a nice house making money, all of that would interfere, but if
###365 you wish to communicate with another person, you either set out advantages - in other words
###372 you bring the other person gifts, then they say "what have you to say?" If you come at
###378 them and say "we're taking your land away, cause we can operate your land more efficiently
###383 than you can" they don't say "great, do that" they have vested interest, and they maintain
###393 their vested interest, that's why you can communicate on the nature of the plannets,
###398 and people will listen to you, it doesn't affect their income, their style of living,
###404 or their values. If you tell them that the moon always faces the earth as it goes around,
###410 they're willing to listen to that, but if you tell them things that interfere with their
###416 positions of differential advantage, communication fails, that is there's no such thing. Am I
###424 clear up to now? This is why people, can only communicate in areas where they have common
###432 values, and common sense of gain, in learning to communicate. If you learned to communicate
###441 with very primitive people, you might be able to talk to them, but it's no real advantage
###447 to you if you're technical, to communicate to primitive people, unless you're doing a
###453 autobiography of some particular cheif. So I would say, in the future, all primitive
###462 people would be updated, not treated as an anthropology study. Anthropology will be considered
###471 socially offensive behavior. If you go to a primitive tribe and make notes of how they
###479 behave and what they talk to the trees about, would not be the propper study of mankind.
###485 The propper study would be the conditions they live under and their limitted communications.
###491 You would have nothing to say to a seminal Indian, of extensionality of you, you might
###499 be able to extend the Indian a little bit, but he can't say anything that would help
###505 you. That's why I point out, it wouldn't make much sense for you to talk to children, because
###513 they can't say anything new. If they're 10 years old, say "my daddy has a bigger car
###518 than your daddy" - they can't say "the engine of a Mercedes displaces so many cubic inches,
###527 therefore it's more efficient." They can't about those things, unless they have wrote
###534 memory, with unreal or no real understanding of what they're saying. So when you say "is
###543 it possible to develop a science of communication?" I would say no, not within established systems.
###552 If a system's established, it automatically cuts communication. Now, if you visit people
###561 from another planet, that have achieved, most  - and have solved most of the problems we
###567 had here, there's a reason for you to learn their language, there's a real advantage,
###573 in learning their language, if they've overcome cancer, heart desease, most nervous disorders,
###581 there's a reason for you to listen. But some people have such a damaged ego, they can't
###587 even hear things that would serve as an advantage to them, they really can't hear it, he may
###594 say "well they don't wanna hear it, cause they feel they've achieved a level advantage,
###600 and who are they to listen to other people?" You know you've got ego problems, so let me
###608 say this, in order for us to communicate we have to establish what communication is! If
###617 we don't establish what that is, and we can't at our present state of development. Say "what
###624 is communication?" without using a referent of our own values, so I'm using this term,
###631 it is impossible to communicate with other people today, unless you teach them your language,
###640 your referants, and they accept them, then you might be able to communicate within the
###649 referants you have given others. So there's no reason right today, for republicans and
###657 democrats to communicate because there's one system that offers advantages. Nobody is interested
###664 in long term advantages. If I say there's an advantage to your culture 50 years from
###671 now, he says "what will serve now?" So that's what he wants to learn, the advantages of
###678 the immediate. If I say 500 years from now, people will live perfectly well, nobodies
###683 interested, because there's no communication of value, that they can receive. So, if scientists,
###694 really were able to - which is almost impossible  - to let go of everything they have and ask
###701 what is communication? They can't ask that question. Do you understand? Ok. So when you
###709 effectively communicate with another person, you either are training them in some way so
###716 that you can - your words would have similar meaning, not subject to interpretation. If
###725 a person develops even a hearing aid, and it works better than another one, he has to
###732 communicate the means of making that work better. Now why does he want it to work better?
###737 Because he gets more money for it. If he doesn't get more money for it, he doesn't concern
###743 himself with it. So there can't be a science of communication, where there's a system of
###749 differential advantage. So it's much easier to give a young girl a gift, and she says
###755 "oh, I'm so impressed by the expense of gift you gave me" what you're doing is softening
###762 her up, toward your value system. She has no fixed value system, if that occurs. If
###770 a person has a fixed value system, like religion which is rigid and fixed, they're not interested
###777 in any kind of communication which takes that away, cause the project a lot of meaning into
###784 that, and you say "their communication is ineffective" they don't give a damn. It does
###792 not communicate what you have in mind. So, first of all, before you even talk about communication,
###799 you have to convince people that they tend to move along established lines, cause they
###807 have proven to be worth while, within a given culture. Do you understand what I'm saying?
###815 I'm leaving out sunny day in May, I'm going right to the point. So if you sit down and
###822 you wanna communicate with another person, first ask them, why they wanna listen to you,
###829 because it serves no immediate value. Unless they're studying communication. Now, the science
###839 of communication today, would be within a given field. If you learn mathematics you
###845 can get jobs doing certain things. So people do not study to improve communication, they
###853 study to pick up advantage to advantage to this system. Is that clear? They do not study
###861 to improve communication, even though a person says "I'm a student of the language of communication"
###868 they can't be that, and be a member of society. Do you understand that? If a person comes
###873 up to you and says "I'm completely neutral, I've come to study communication" that is
###881 not possible. Do you understand why? No one can be completely neutral, you're always a
###888 victim of culture.
