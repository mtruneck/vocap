###1 FREUND: The brain initiative recently announced by the White House is really designed to facilitate
###11 innovative strategies to better understand the brain. And in order to do that we need
###16 new technologies. CLARITY is a great example of the type of new technologies that will
###22 enable future brain studies.
###25 So prior to this technology, scientists used methods where they would take thin slices
###31 of the brain. They would put these on glass slides, process them with antibodies, which
###38 illuminate what chemicals are there. And then they would have to use a microscope to study
###44 which transmitters are in which locations. Unfortunately, you can’t see the structure
###49 of a neuron in a brain slice.
###52 So with this technology, they’re able to look at the entire neuron in a three dimensional
###57 volume. And with this three dimensional structure intact, you can see where the neuron starts
###65 and what brain region it projects to. In slices, you can only see what’s in the position
###72 where you started. And what this technology will allow is to do is not only study what
###78 molecular or single elements of a cell are located in a neuron, but how those communicate
###85 with other elements in the brain.
###87 So in the recent publication by Deisseroth and colleagues, they describe not only the
###91 ability to look at animal models – or whole brains of animals – but also the ability
###97 to look in human brain. So in a post-mortem brain from a child suffering from autism,
###103 they were able to trace neuronal projections from a significant volume of tissue. They’re
###109 also able to use the technology to stain for neurochemicals located in that brain region.
###117 And the potential for this type of research is great for understanding how disruptions
###122 in neural circuitry are involved in disorders. It has really transformative potential.
###129 The technology shows us in the video an area of the brain that’s involved in memory,
###136 the hippocampus. And this video shows the neurons that are involved in processing memory,
###141 where they project, and what neurotransmitters, or chemicals are contained in those neurons.
###147 And it shows this in three dimensions, so you see not only where they start and where
###151 they project and how they might interact to form memories.
###155 The video through an entire mouse brain shows us how neurons are connected. So the neural
###161 circuitry – which neurons project to which areas in the brain, how they might be involved
###165 in giving commands to execute certain functions that we know about from physiology studies,
###172 but we don’t actually know how they connect to each other. This technology allows you
###177 to bring those together.
