###0 MICHAEL HASTINGS: I had never heard that level of disrespect
###2 directed towards the commander-in-chief from an
###5 officer or any officer, certainly.
###7 Guys on the ground, and this is a very underreported story,
###10 you could go into Afghanistan and do day after day of
###12 stories of quoting Marines, quoting American soldiers
###15 trashing President Obama.
###16 Nobody does that.
###17 They did it for Bush in Iraq.
###18 When a soldier criticized President Bush, it was news.
###21 So this criticising Obama because of the media's love
###23 for Obama is not news.
###25 
###28 BEN ANDERSON: McChrystal was supposed to have gotten fired
###29 because of your piece in Rolling Stone.
###31 Do you think he was fired because of that piece?
###33 MICHAEL HASTINGS: No.
###33 I think there had been tensions between the Pentagon
###36 and the White House.
###38 Was the Rolling Stone story the excuse to fire this guy?
###42 Look, if he'd been winning the war, and the president would
###44 have been happy with him, they could have easily said, oh,
###47 it's Rolling Stone.
###49 People make mistakes.
###50 General McChrystal and his staff didn't think they were
###52 going to get fired even when the story came out.
###55 They thought the story was going to be worse,
###56 according to them.
###57 I had overheard this other comment, which
###59 was very, very bad.
###61 BEN ANDERSON: From McChrystal himself?
###62 MICHAEL HASTINGS: From one of his guys.
###64 I can't even go into what it was,
###65 because it's so explosive.
###66 So to see these senior military officials criticize
###70 the president not only in front of me, but in front of
###73 staffs of dozens, I think was--
###77 they questioned the judgment.
###78 BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.
###79 Everything came out in the book.
###80 You named people you hadn't named in the
###81 Rolling Stone article.
###82 MICHAEL HASTINGS: Sure.
###82 BEN ANDERSON: Well, did you get a reaction
###83 from the guys featured?
###84 MICHAEL HASTINGS: The book critically did quite well.
###86 It was well received.
###88 Really positive response in terms of consumers and
###92 whatnot, actually.
###93 The most overt volley from the sort of Pentagon was this
###101 review in the Wall Street Journal, which they had a
###103 military contractor who worked for Petraeus and General
###107 Caldwell and was an unofficial advisor to General McChrystal
###110 trashed the book in the Wall Street Journal
###112 in the first day.
###113 And he didn't disclose that he actually worked
###115 for all these generals.
###117 So that's how they operate.
###119 They had made attempts over the previous year.
###121 There had been two, actually three Pentagon investigations
###123 into my work.
###125 They had made pretty serious attempts to try to undermine
###127 the reporting in Rolling Stone.
###128 I bet they felt on some level they were making progress
###131 there, but I think that with the success of the book and
###134 the fact that no one has disputed anything in the book.
###136 No one has ever-- has yet to dispute any facts in the
###138 original story.
###139 BEN ANDERSON: Whenever you meet anyone from the very top
###141 guy to the very bottom guy, nothing is off the record.
###143 MICHAEL HASTINGS: Yeah.
###144 BEN ANDERSON: That's one of the first
###144 things they tell you.
###144 MICHAEL HASTINGS: Yeah.
###145 You actually have to sign a piece of paper when you go on
###147 embed that says everything is on the record.
###149 And it was interesting.
###150 Complicit in this were my colleagues in the Washington
###153 Pentagon Press Corps, who would just sort of take this
###157 bullshit that the Pentagon was feeding them and run stories,
###161 not calling for comments from me, not even reading the
###165 reports that they were quoting from and characterizing.
###167 So this is me complaining about my Pentagon colleagues.
###170 BEN ANDERSON: I think I was in Afghanistan and someone said
###172 you'd applied for an embed and been denied
###174 MICHAEL HASTINGS: Right.
###175 BEN ANDERSON: --an embed.
###175 That's true?
###176 MICHAEL HASTINGS: I had already been approved for an
###177 embed, and I don't think the military knew.
###180 ISAF didn't even know about it.
###182 And then I was doing a talk, and someone asked me, well,
###185 how is your relationship with the military?
###186 I said, actually, I talk to soldiers all the time, and in
###188 fact, I'm going on an embed next month.
###191 They sent in, someone did a blog post within 24 hours.
###193 Apparently my name is in Google Alerts somewhere.
###196 I got a letter that said, because of your story about
###198 General McChrystal and the political fallout, you're no
###201 longer allowed to come over unless you get like four
###204 written sworn statements.
###205 And it was a headquarters thing.
###207 BEN ANDERSON: I was reading before the fuss it caused, you
###210 still thought this would make a--
###211 MICHAEL HASTINGS: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
###212 And I interviewed them for hours and hours when
###214 I was on this trip.
###214 I knew after day two of them that I want to write a book
###216 about them.
###217 BEN ANDERSON: And they knew that?
###219 MICHAEL HASTINGS: Yeah, I'd make jokes
###219 about it all the time.
###220 And one of the interesting things was they were sort of
###222 holding out access.
###223 They were playing this game with a variety of reporters,
###225 some big names, about who was going to get the best access
###228 for the book projects.
###229 BEN ANDERSON: Because someone was going to do the official
###230 biography of McChrystal, which was going to be a big seller.
###233 MICHAEL HASTINGS: So this was sort of the carrot they were
###235 putting out there for me.
###236 BEN ANDERSON: You know, they seemed excited by the idea of
###238 having a Rolling Stone journalist as opposed to Wall
###240 Street Journal, or Washington Post, or New York Times.
###242 McChrystal said, my kids want me to be on the cover of
###245 Rolling Stone.
###245 So you feel like you've change the course of the war in
###248 Afghanistan or changed policy?
###250 MICHAEL HASTINGS: Well, a lot of this story is actually
###251 about how counter-insurgency doesn't work.
###254 We can take credit for sort of cementing that narrative or at
###257 least making it very obvious that this is a real problem.
###261 Great.
###261 BEN ANDERSON: Michael, thank you very much.
###262 MICHAEL HASTINGS: Later, man.
###263
