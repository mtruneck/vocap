1
0:0:2,55 --> 0:0:4,58
this about really


2
0:0:4,58 --> 0:0:7,809
apresentava almost considering signing a
new packed on


3
0:0:7,809 --> 0:0:12,69
uh... trade relations and factory was
unit remove the european union


4
0:0:12,69 --> 0:0:15,569
now this could be rather on controversy
already had a very good trade relations


5
0:0:15,569 --> 0:0:16,96
with europe


6
0:0:16,96 --> 0:0:17,97
uh... but in


7
0:0:17,97 --> 0:0:21,39
said they decide to put something in
there called investors state


8
0:0:21,39 --> 0:0:22,4
dispute resolution


9
0:0:22,4 --> 0:0:26,169
now that sounds terrific legoland not
clear what it is right well let's


10
0:0:26,169 --> 0:0:26,89
explain


11
0:0:26,89 --> 0:0:29,47
and that's just a dispute resolution


12
0:0:29,47 --> 0:0:33,1
would allow company to kill a regulatory
winnie world war


13
0:0:33,1 --> 0:0:35,11
to international core


14
0:0:35,11 --> 0:0:39,6
so that's why this in this field between
investors and the state


15
0:0:39,6 --> 0:0:42,28
and what this is saying is waiting it
will also see


16
0:0:42,28 --> 0:0:44,31
what was also small system is


17
0:0:44,31 --> 0:0:47,61
wasn't just a johnson has the dispute
with param


18
0:0:47,61 --> 0:0:50,91
and we've got a trade agreement with
panama for example if we did


19
0:0:50,91 --> 0:0:52,36
and were about to


20
0:0:52,36 --> 0:0:54,85
well they just uh... does it was a on a
u_s_ company to go to the u_s_


21
0:0:54,85 --> 0:0:56,279
government seeking u


22
0:0:56,279 --> 0:0:58,51
hope resolve this dispute


23
0:0:58,51 --> 0:1:1,84
under this new way of doing it and it
hasn't been siding yet but


24
0:1:1,84 --> 0:1:5,7
president bomb isn't there i'm sure all
the republicans are going to be in favor


25
0:1:5,7 --> 0:1:6,69
because they do


26
0:1:6,69 --> 0:1:10,11
it's a corporation the corporation what
other problems that yes or how how are


27
0:1:10,11 --> 0:1:10,81
you sir


28
0:1:10,81 --> 0:1:12,56
bob will jump to smother stuffed


29
0:1:12,56 --> 0:1:14,63
so both sides are agreed to this and


30
0:1:14,63 --> 0:1:18,94
so we're not world the trouble but now
that all of this new regime


31
0:1:18,94 --> 0:1:21,91
well then johnson does does in the
united states air worthiness is directly


32
0:1:21,91 --> 0:1:23,4
soup and


33
0:1:23,4 --> 0:1:26,67
which would allow them the ability to
intimidate so many different states all


34
0:1:26,67 --> 0:1:30,2
you really one of the cost of fighting
answer hundreds of lawyers will come in


35
0:1:30,2 --> 0:1:30,77
for you


36
0:1:30,77 --> 0:1:32,47
or you deal with that


37
0:1:32,47 --> 0:1:35,64
regulation you have an awesome pollute
you're ever


38
0:1:35,64 --> 0:1:37,55
now you think that's all no no no


39
0:1:37,55 --> 0:1:40,73
it also puts the united states


40
0:1:40,73 --> 0:1:43,68
the international body would be given
authority to impose economic sanctions


41
0:1:43,68 --> 0:1:44,649
against


42
0:1:44,649 --> 0:1:45,689
any country


43
0:1:45,689 --> 0:1:47,37
they're violating this verdict


44
0:1:47,37 --> 0:1:50,41
including the united states


45
0:1:50,41 --> 0:1:52,25
you know this is


46
0:1:52,25 --> 0:1:55,0
this is uh... clearer infringement


47
0:1:55,0 --> 0:1:58,159
on arts summer aunty


48
0:1:58,159 --> 0:2:2,5
on the conservatism poster that's


49
0:2:2,5 --> 0:2:5,85
well then they don't know what
conservative is they have no idea what


50
0:2:5,85 --> 0:2:7,579
their ideology stands for


51
0:2:7,579 --> 0:2:11,929
this is exactly what you say don't tread
on me for you're gonna get away


52
0:2:11,929 --> 0:2:15,169
you know what this would allow that
would allow foreign corporations by the


53
0:2:15,169 --> 0:2:18,99
way also u_s_ corporations the coming
years a


54
0:2:18,99 --> 0:2:21,649
walls to the unique in the united states
del piney and i think you know to


55
0:2:21,649 --> 0:2:23,67
international court and get you


56
0:2:23,67 --> 0:2:26,49
to get ready road salt you don't want

0:2:30,799 --> 0:2:34,76
i can pollute those risks who's gonna
turn corporations and the simon indies


59
0:2:34,76 --> 0:2:36,639
bind themselves


60
0:2:36,639 --> 0:2:39,22
now of course everytime giving summer
ninety


61
0:2:39,22 --> 0:2:42,609
you can't help but think of poor old
george w_ bush


62
0:2:42,609 --> 0:2:45,58
now this was the rest of tribal
sovereignty in accordance already


63
0:2:45,58 --> 0:2:48,909
at that point every hadn't even thought
of that yet right


64
0:2:48,909 --> 0:2:49,879
reminds you of this


65
0:2:49,879 --> 0:2:52,109
jam from the former president


66
0:2:52,109 --> 0:2:53,129
what do you think


67
0:2:53,129 --> 0:2:56,259
tribal sovereignty means in the truck in
the twenty-first century


68
0:2:56,259 --> 0:3:0,499
and how do we resolve conflicts between
tribes confederacy contact


69
0:3:0,499 --> 0:3:3,749
travel sovereignty sets up


70
0:3:3,749 --> 0:3:5,69
you ready


71
0:3:5,69 --> 0:3:6,249

73
0:3:9,29 --> 0:3:15,259
duties as sovereign


74
0:3:15,259 --> 0:3:18,629
therefore the relationship between the
federal government and


75
0:3:18,629 --> 0:3:20,709
tribes is one between ps


76
0:3:20,709 --> 0:3:24,4
sovereign entity


77
0:3:24,4 --> 0:3:24,51
uh...


78
0:3:24,51 --> 0:3:25,599
dot blotting is all


79
0:3:25,599 --> 0:3:26,6
laughter


80
0:3:26,6 --> 0:3:27,799
along with


81
0:3:27,799 --> 0:3:31,29

framework will be subject to the
progress a presentation within the


85
0:3:42,51 --> 0:3:43,15
government


86
0:3:43,15 --> 0:3:44,959
brokerage firms


87
0:3:44,959 --> 0:3:46,129
don't worry


88
0:3:46,129 --> 0:3:49,149
uh... we got your back that they'll be
safeguards


89
0:3:49,149 --> 0:3:53,9
was surprised uh... maybe they want to
his work


90
0:3:53,9 --> 0:3:53,79
okay


91
0:3:53,79 --> 0:3:55,2
ga-ga i'd put


92
0:3:55,2 --> 0:3:56,639
noble receptors


93
0:3:56,639 --> 0:3:59,339
uh... a la assault on from the sierra
club


94
0:3:59,339 --> 0:4:0,59
males and she says


95
0:4:0,59 --> 0:4:4,289
these provisions all big corporations
the level of nation states


96
0:4:4,289 --> 0:4:9,229
and allow them to send arms over nearly
any law or policy which reduces their


97
0:4:9,229 --> 0:4:10,989
future profits


98
0:4:10,989 --> 0:4:13,15
and it does by the way talks about their
profits


99
0:4:13,15 --> 0:4:15,63
they got a right to their profits if
your friends on the right to the


100
0:4:15,63 --> 0:4:17,949
apartments all those other sovereign
entities


101
0:4:17,949 --> 0:4:19,709
melting into an international court


102
0:4:19,709 --> 0:4:22,619
and invalidate your national law


103
0:4:22,619 --> 0:4:26,78
all conservative hence you'd be
exploring other cargonoff dogs


104
0:4:26,78 --> 0:4:30,599
these are the black helicopters my
friends


105
0:4:30,599 --> 0:4:32,37
any action willing to warn you


106
0:4:32,37 --> 0:4:36,12
say you'll be dead studies i don't think
there actually are bringing black


107
0:4:36,12 --> 0:4:38,619
welcomes them out of just be clear


108
0:4:38,619 --> 0:4:39,669
but they will


109
0:4:39,669 --> 0:4:40,729
get


110
0:4:40,729 --> 0:4:44,909
signifi only infringe on our sovereignty
by doing this


111
0:4:44,909 --> 0:4:48,229
u_s_ chamber of commerce turns it around
i love these guys


112
0:4:48,229 --> 0:4:50,819
slash i can send quote


113
0:4:50,819 --> 0:4:52,699
the they push for an increased


114
0:4:52,699 --> 0:4:57,449
regulatory compatibility an updated
comprehensive investment terms


115
0:4:57,449 --> 0:4:58,72
through caught


116
0:4:58,72 --> 0:5:0,34
prevent discrimination


117
0:5:0,34 --> 0:5:3,99
against investors in the trade pact


118
0:5:3,99 --> 0:5:4,24
all right


119
0:5:4,24 --> 0:5:8,149
the problem we had was we're
discriminating as corporations too much


120
0:5:8,149 --> 0:5:10,24
now they explain this because they said
they


121
0:5:10,24 --> 0:5:12,849
reporter asked miss women


122
0:5:12,849 --> 0:5:15,49
you seem to have gotten everything you
want in the street agreements already


123
0:5:15,49 --> 0:5:18,12
with the european what do you want here


124
0:5:18,12 --> 0:5:21,99
this thing we're trying to do this
permission against us


125
0:5:21,99 --> 0:5:22,7
and have a space offer


126
0:5:22,7 --> 0:5:24,93
and get rid of the country's


127
0:5:24,93 --> 0:5:28,449
and this is the campaign attention is
incredibly scary


128
0:5:28,449 --> 0:5:30,499
this is where corporations


129
0:5:30,499 --> 0:5:33,5
start to rule over the nation's


130
0:5:33,5 --> 0:5:35,0
these member on broadway shows


131
0:5:35,0 --> 0:5:39,119
soon nations will be under the umbrella
of corporations


132
0:5:39,119 --> 0:5:42,59
uh... ivy lori wallach who's the
director of public citizen's globaltrade


133
0:5:42,59 --> 0:5:43,569
watch


134
0:5:43,569 --> 0:5:46,46
understood their intent perfectly says
quote


135
0:5:46,46 --> 0:5:48,919
the dirty little secret about the
negotiation


136
0:5:48,919 --> 0:5:52,6
is that it is not merely a bad trade but
rather what we're target


137
0:5:52,6 --> 0:5:54,99
for elimination


138
0:5:54,99 --> 0:5:56,91
strongest consumer health safety privacy


139
0:5:56,91 --> 0:5:59,86
environmental an other public interest
policies


140
0:5:59,86 --> 0:6:2,499
on either side of that way


141
0:6:2,499 --> 0:6:6,339
so you'll have european companies and
banks in the u_s_ to get rid of our


142
0:6:6,339 --> 0:6:9,39
regulations to get rid of


143
0:6:9,39 --> 0:6:12,43
pollution standards our health and
safety standards


144
0:6:12,43 --> 0:6:13,98
annual u_s_ companies


145
0:6:13,98 --> 0:6:17,389
suing european companies uh... european
countries


146
0:6:17,389 --> 0:6:21,289
near p and given their statements


147
0:6:21,289 --> 0:6:22,97
it's a disaster in the making


148
0:6:22,97 --> 0:8:22,97
and is very likely to pass
