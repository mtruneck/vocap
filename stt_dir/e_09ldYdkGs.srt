0:0:2,76 --> 0:0:5,21
RYAN DUFFY: So not too long ago,
we went and met with J.T.


3
0:0:5,21 --> 0:0:7,9
Ready to do a piece about border
militias in Arizona.


4
0:0:7,9 --> 0:0:11,35
During our filming, it became
apparent to us that J.T. was a


5
0:0:11,35 --> 0:0:15,26
complex and complicated guy, but
we had no idea that things


6
0:0:15,26 --> 0:0:16,61
were as dark as they were.


7
0:0:16,61 --> 0:0:18,47
We were super saddened
by the events


8
0:0:18,47 --> 0:0:19,77
this morning in Arizona.


9
0:0:19,77 --> 0:0:21,68
He was a very charismatic
guy, right?


10
0:0:21,68 --> 0:0:26,98
The whole piece that you're
about to see is a PR tour,


11
0:0:26,98 --> 0:0:28,17
essentially.


12
0:0:28,17 --> 0:0:30,15
He's a spinster.


13
0:0:30,15 --> 0:0:34,76
He was very well aware of the
perceptions of him and did his


14
0:0:34,76 --> 0:0:39,49
best to counteract that and to
show a different side of what


15
0:0:39,49 --> 0:0:40,38
he was doing.


16
0:0:40,38 --> 0:0:43,2
At the same time, we
knew about him.


17
0:0:43,2 --> 0:0:46,75
We had done our research, we had
done our pre-production.


18
0:0:46,75 --> 0:0:48,37
And we knew that there
were photos of


19
0:0:48,37 --> 0:0:49,78
him at neo-Nazi rallies.


20
0:0:49,78 --> 0:0:52,97
We knew that he had made
statements to the press in the


21
0:0:52,97 --> 0:0:57,95
past that were horrible
and awful.


22
0:0:57,95 --> 0:1:2,5
And we asked him about those,
and he very kind of slickly


23
0:1:2,5 --> 0:1:6,9
and slyly denied and danced
around them, so they didn't


24
0:1:6,9 --> 0:1:9,5
become a centerpiece
of the piece.


25
0:1:9,5 --> 0:1:14,51
And I guess, in retrospect, I
guess I wish we did hammer on


26
0:1:14,51 --> 0:1:15,36
that a little bit more.


27
0:1:15,36 --> 0:1:20,8
Overall, someone that we spent
time with and shared a meal


28
0:1:20,8 --> 0:1:25,12
with has done something so
god-awful and tragic.


29
0:1:25,12 --> 0:1:30,7
So it caused us to think we
should revisit our piece, the


30
0:1:30,7 --> 0:1:33,9
Vice Guide to Border Militias,
and share it with you guys.


31
0:1:33,9 --> 0:1:35,95
So this is the Vice Guide
to Border Militias.


32
0:1:35,95 --> 0:1:41,31
[MUSIC PLAYING]


33
0:1:41,31 --> 0:1:42,87
RYAN DUFFY: So the private
militia has kind of come


34
0:1:42,87 --> 0:1:44,34
roaring back to life
in America in


35
0:1:44,34 --> 0:1:45,58
the last couple years.


36
0:1:45,58 --> 0:1:47,59
And they're rattling around a
bunch of different causes.


37
0:1:47,59 --> 0:1:50,215
Now for J.T and the Ready
Rangers, it's this stretch of


38
0:1:50,215 --> 0:1:52,7
land here in Stanfield,
Arizona.


39
0:1:52,7 --> 0:1:56,255
Basically, it's no man's land,
3,000 acres of American soil


40
0:1:56,255 --> 0:1:58,96
that US citizens are discouraged
from entering and


41
0:1:58,96 --> 0:2:1,53
illegal immigrants regularly
travel through while sneaking


42
0:2:1,53 --> 0:2:2,68
across the border.


43
0:2:2,68 --> 0:2:5,65
So J.T. Ready and the Ready
Rangers have stepped in.


44
0:2:5,65 --> 0:2:7,84
J.T. READY: We do kind of have
a Wild West spirit out here.


45
0:2:7,84 --> 0:2:9,75
We have very liberal gun laws.


46
0:2:9,75 --> 0:2:10,82
You can own machine guns.


47
0:2:10,82 --> 0:2:13,18
You can legally own grenades,
tanks even.


48
0:2:13,18 --> 0:2:16,14
We got some terrorist coming
at us with machine guns and


49
0:2:16,14 --> 0:2:18,19
ski masks in the middle of the
desert, we're allowed to shoot


50
0:2:18,19 --> 0:2:18,74
him right in the face.


51
0:2:18,74 --> 0:2:20,38
And we want him to know
there's Americans


52
0:2:20,38 --> 0:2:22,28
standing the line.


53
0:2:22,28 --> 0:2:24,45
RYAN DUFFY: The Ready Rangers
are a bunch of volunteers out


54
0:2:24,45 --> 0:2:27,3
here patrolling 160
miles of desert.


55
0:2:27,3 --> 0:2:30,84
And to be clear, absolutely
no one has asked them to.


56
0:2:30,84 --> 0:2:31,65
J.T. READY: OK, here you go.


57
0:2:31,65 --> 0:2:33,405
See this ski mask?


58
0:2:33,405 --> 0:2:36,666
You don't wear those out here
in this heat, unless


59
0:2:36,666 --> 0:2:38,36
you're a bad guy.


60
0:2:38,36 --> 0:2:40,15
RYAN DUFFY: J.T. is all about
being the good guy.


61
0:2:40,15 --> 0:2:42,56
And part of that is making
the bad guys look


62
0:2:42,56 --> 0:2:44,35
really, really bad.


63
0:2:44,35 --> 0:2:46,92
J.T. READY: Life is very low
on the totem pole when it


64
0:2:46,92 --> 0:2:47,99
comes to the cartel.


65
0:2:47,99 --> 0:2:50,75
There's a thing called rape
trees, cutting off body parts.


66
0:2:50,75 --> 0:2:52,74
They mail them back to Mom
and Pop down south.


67
0:2:52,74 --> 0:2:56,15
Bloody undergarments, Los Zetas,
pockets full of feces.


68
0:2:56,15 --> 0:2:58,19
When the coroner comes out here
and tries to remove that


69
0:2:58,19 --> 0:2:59,93
duct tape, it takes her
face with them.


70
0:2:59,93 --> 0:3:1,63
And they'll leave heads and
things like that on the


71
0:3:1,63 --> 0:3:4,76
border, just all packed
in there like Amistad.


72
0:3:4,76 --> 0:3:6,9
RYAN DUFFY: J.T. wanted us to
know that even though he wants


73
0:3:6,9 --> 0:3:9,53
to shoot drug smugglers directly
in the face, he's


74
0:3:9,53 --> 0:3:11,65
totally into helping out the
regular, old, illegal


75
0:3:11,65 --> 0:3:13,4
immigrants he finds.


76
0:3:13,4 --> 0:3:16,49
J.T. READY: We try to give the
regular UDAs as much respect


77
0:3:16,49 --> 0:3:19,69
as possible, that includes out
of our own pocket, water,


78
0:3:19,69 --> 0:3:20,92
limes, they like limes.


79
0:3:20,92 --> 0:3:23,32
They like garlic and
stuff like that.


80
0:3:23,32 --> 0:3:24,94
We try to think of their
cultural stuff.


81
0:3:24,94 --> 0:3:27,1
RYAN DUFFY: Could you imagine
if you were starving in a


82
0:3:27,1 --> 0:3:30,16
desert for a week, it was 110
degrees in the shade, and a


83
0:3:30,16 --> 0:3:31,466
dude found you and was like,
oh, don't worry, I'm


84
0:3:31,466 --> 0:3:31,93
going to help you.


85
0:3:31,93 --> 0:3:34,23
Here's a lime and a clove of
garlic because I understand


86
0:3:34,23 --> 0:3:35,79
your culture.


87
0:3:35,79 --> 0:3:38,48
J.T. Is so focused on getting
his side of the story out


88
0:3:38,48 --> 0:3:40,81
there that he turned our border
patrol into some sort


89
0:3:40,81 --> 0:3:43,72
of international press junket,
with a bunch of crews filming


90
0:3:43,72 --> 0:3:47,26
the Ready Rangers getting
the job done.


91
0:3:47,26 --> 0:3:50,23
The craziest part about all of
this is what J.T. Is doing is


92
0:3:50,23 --> 0:3:51,33
totally legal.


93
0:3:51,33 --> 0:3:53,58
Not only has the US government
not figured out how to


94
0:3:53,58 --> 0:3:56,74
regulate the border, they've
also let guys like J.T. wander


95
0:3:56,74 --> 0:3:58,15
around the desert with
some buddies and a


96
0:3:58,15 --> 0:4:0,19
military-grade arsenal.


97
0:4:0,19 --> 0:4:3,0
And that makes him feel
like an American hero.


98
0:4:3,0 --> 0:4:5,83
J.T. READY: I'm just out there
bearing assault rifles and


99
0:4:5,83 --> 0:4:8,34
saving lives and looking
for narco-terrorists.


100
0:4:8,34 --> 0:4:10,466
That which doesn't kill
me makes me smarter.


101
0:4:10,466 --> 0:4:12,48
And that which does kill me
will make me a martyr.


102
0:4:12,48 --> 0:6:12,48
