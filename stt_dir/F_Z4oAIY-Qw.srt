1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,389
-Where's his skateboard at?


2
0:0:1,389 --> 0:0:1,852
-I don't know.


3
0:0:1,852 --> 0:0:3,241
You mean Shawn?


4
0:0:3,241 --> 0:0:5,0
-Yeah, the friend
you came with.


5
0:0:5,0 --> 0:0:5,93
He's a fucking bitch.


6
0:0:5,93 --> 0:0:7,93
-You are, your boy's going
to get fucked up.


7
0:0:7,93 --> 0:0:9,975
-He's going to get his ass
kicked if I fucking see him


8
0:0:9,975 --> 0:0:10,134
again.


9
0:0:10,134 --> 0:0:10,611
-Yeah.


10
0:0:10,611 --> 0:0:11,9
Did he jet?


11
0:0:11,9 --> 0:0:11,94
-I guess, dude.


12
0:0:11,94 --> 0:0:14,15
But you tell me he shouldn't
never talk shit because we


13
0:0:14,15 --> 0:0:15,65
don't be talking shit
about nobody.


14
0:0:15,65 --> 0:0:16,219
-That's cool.


15
0:0:16,219 --> 0:0:18,19
-You respect us, we respect you,
you know what I'm saying?


16
0:0:18,19 --> 0:0:18,967
-That's cool.


17
0:0:18,967 --> 0:0:21,452
-Tell your boy,


18
0:0:21,452 --> 0:0:22,943
-Where's his board at?


19
0:0:22,943 --> 0:0:25,428
-I'll keep the [INAUDIBLE]
focused in on him.


20
0:0:25,428 --> 0:0:41,332



21
0:0:41,332 --> 0:0:45,39
PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, welcome back
to "Epicly Later'd." This


22
0:0:45,39 --> 0:0:48,9
week's episode is about
the Menace team.


23
0:0:48,9 --> 0:0:51,15
And it's not about any specific
person, it's just


24
0:0:51,15 --> 0:0:53,58
sort of about a cultural
shift in skateboarding.


25
0:0:53,58 --> 0:0:55,8
-Fuck you got to say, niggah?


26
0:0:55,8 --> 0:0:57,79
PATRICK O'DELL: You know, LA,
New York, all these city kid


27
0:0:57,79 --> 0:1:1,51
skaters that kind of came
together as the team Menace.


28
0:1:1,51 --> 0:1:3,75
It's kinda thuggy, it's
kind of dangerous.


29
0:1:3,75 --> 0:1:6,52
When I was a kid and somebody
had like the NWA tape and it


30
0:1:6,52 --> 0:1:9,55
was really bad to have.


31
0:1:9,55 --> 0:1:12,8
Menace was like skating's
version of that--


32
0:1:12,8 --> 0:1:14,76
like skating's NWA.


33
0:1:14,76 --> 0:1:17,63
Some of these skaters, like
Fabian and Steven Cales, they


34
0:1:17,63 --> 0:1:20,5
ended up doing a lot
of time in jail.


35
0:1:20,5 --> 0:1:22,45
Joey's found religion,
he has a family, he's


36
0:1:22,45 --> 0:1:23,82
doing really well.


37
0:1:23,82 --> 0:1:26,11
We caught up with Eric Pupecki
in Rhode Island.


38
0:1:26,11 --> 0:1:29,1
Javier Nunez is doing great,
he's an actor.


39
0:1:29,1 --> 0:1:32,1
So these shows aren't perfect.


40
0:1:32,1 --> 0:1:34,58
Maybe four or five times I made
a plan with Green and


41
0:1:34,58 --> 0:1:35,57
then it fell through.


42
0:1:35,57 --> 0:1:39,0
I'm not talking shit on the guy,
I'm just saying he's hard


43
0:1:39,0 --> 0:1:39,95
to a hold of.


44
0:1:39,95 --> 0:1:41,12
Basically I'm saying
we don't have the


45
0:1:41,12 --> 0:1:42,58
Kareem Campbell interview.


46
0:1:42,58 --> 0:1:43,84
That's how it is.


47
0:1:43,84 --> 0:1:46,745
For a long time I've kind of had
this on the back burner as


48
0:1:46,745 --> 0:1:47,99
an episode I wanted to do.


49
0:1:47,99 --> 0:1:49,92
Like, I should do a
Menace episode.


50
0:1:49,92 --> 0:1:52,91
So I'm glad this is finally
coming out.


51
0:1:52,91 --> 0:1:54,344
I hope you enjoy it.


52
0:1:54,344 --> 0:1:58,168



53
0:1:58,168 --> 0:2:2,33
BILLY VALDES: We had no Kareem
for, I don't know, forever.


54
0:2:2,33 --> 0:2:5,16
He'll probably deny this,
but I claim I


55
0:2:5,16 --> 0:2:7,92
taught him 360 flips.


56
0:2:7,92 --> 0:2:10,46
This is when he was
on World SMA.


57
0:2:10,46 --> 0:2:12,76
And I was trying to
get on Grind King.


58
0:2:12,76 --> 0:2:15,896
That's like '89 or something.


59
0:2:15,896 --> 0:2:19,84
PATRICK O'DELL: Tell me about
exactly how you got on Menace?


60
0:2:19,84 --> 0:2:23,26
BILLY VALDES: Kareem was a hot
boy at the time, winning all


61
0:2:23,26 --> 0:2:24,8
these contests.


62
0:2:24,8 --> 0:2:27,97
Skating for world after
the whole, basically,


63
0:2:27,97 --> 0:2:30,39
Girl/Chocolate team
now, or then--


64
0:2:30,39 --> 0:2:33,79
I guess now it's
different, too.


65
0:2:33,79 --> 0:2:37,68
Al Quinn started Girl
Skateboards, and Kareem had an


66
0:2:37,68 --> 0:2:39,71
opportunity to start
his own company.


67
0:2:39,71 --> 0:2:44,6
And since we had all been
friends for a while, I guess


68
0:2:44,6 --> 0:2:45,782
he saw something in this.


69
0:2:45,782 --> 0:2:47,28
No, that's boring.


70
0:2:47,28 --> 0:2:51,63



71
0:2:51,63 --> 0:2:54,84
SOCRATES LEAL: Kareem came
back, got on World.


72
0:2:54,84 --> 0:2:56,8
We were all psyched.


73
0:2:56,8 --> 0:3:0,33
And he was on World for a couple
years before he came up


74
0:3:0,33 --> 0:3:3,36
with the idea for Menace and
just put together a team of


75
0:3:3,36 --> 0:3:5,99
dudes that hung out in LA.


76
0:3:5,99 --> 0:3:8,17
They always hung out at
that extra large shop.


77
0:3:8,17 --> 0:3:10,77
So he put together that team
and said hey, wouldn't you


78
0:3:10,77 --> 0:3:11,83
mind filming these guys?


79
0:3:11,83 --> 0:3:13,54
I was like, oh yeah, I'm down
to film these dudes.


80
0:3:13,54 --> 0:3:21,73



81
0:3:21,73 --> 0:3:25,6
This is the first transfer tip
for Menace because that was


82
0:3:25,6 --> 0:3:26,14
their first logo right there.


83
0:3:26,14 --> 0:3:28,8
PATRICK O'DELL: What were the
plans with all the footage?


84
0:3:28,8 --> 0:3:29,66
SOCRATES LEAL: Well, of course
we were going to try to make


85
0:3:29,66 --> 0:3:30,79
them a video.


86
0:3:30,79 --> 0:3:31,992
PATRICK O'DELL: What were
the challenges of that?


87
0:3:31,992 --> 0:3:34,745
SOCRATES LEAL: That Kareem
needed to approve it.


88
0:3:34,745 --> 0:3:38,97
It's his company and his first
video, and I feel him on that.


89
0:3:38,97 --> 0:3:40,81
He wanted to make sure
it was top notch.


90
0:3:40,81 --> 0:3:42,956
PATRICK O'DELL: He didn't think
it was good enough?


91
0:3:42,956 --> 0:3:45,67
SOCRATES LEAL: I can't put words
in his mouth, you know?


92
0:3:45,67 --> 0:3:48,975
All I know is that he just
kind of put a stop on it.


93
0:3:48,975 --> 0:3:53,66



94
0:3:53,66 --> 0:3:56,95
Filming for Menace was one of
those deals where it was at


95
0:3:56,95 --> 0:3:57,53
the moment.


96
0:3:57,53 --> 0:4:0,41
If you were there at a spot,
and I had the camera and


97
0:4:0,41 --> 0:4:1,8
everyone else was kind
of along with


98
0:4:1,8 --> 0:4:3,72
it, it would happen.


99
0:4:3,72 --> 0:4:5,94
And if it didn't for whatever
reason, like we'd get kicked


100
0:4:5,94 --> 0:4:8,86
out of a spot or he'd break his
board, then that day was


101
0:4:8,86 --> 0:4:10,52
over and that would never
happen again.


102
0:4:10,52 --> 0:4:12,45
PATRICK O'DELL: Were you ever
worried about going to some of


103
0:4:12,45 --> 0:4:13,795
the sketchy neighborhoods
and stuff like that?


104
0:4:13,795 --> 0:4:15,82
Because I always heard of like
Lockwood, people get their


105
0:4:15,82 --> 0:4:16,55
cameras stolen.


106
0:4:16,55 --> 0:4:16,76
SOCRATES LEAL: Yeah.


107
0:4:16,76 --> 0:4:19,264
I mean, I found out about all
that after I had been filming


108
0:4:19,264 --> 0:4:20,72
it for like a year or two.


109
0:4:20,72 --> 0:4:24,23
One day we were there filming,
it was like a 4th of July, and


110
0:4:24,23 --> 0:4:25,61
I remember hearing the shots.


111
0:4:25,61 --> 0:4:31,4
But I was filming lines running
around the schoolyard.


112
0:4:31,4 --> 0:4:33,215
PATRICK O'DELL: Originally,
not that many


113
0:4:33,215 --> 0:4:34,24
people skated here?


114
0:4:34,24 --> 0:4:35,3
FABIAN ALOMAR: No.


115
0:4:35,3 --> 0:4:38,12
It was only a few gang members
right here from La Medalla


116
0:4:38,12 --> 0:4:39,19
neighborhood.


117
0:4:39,19 --> 0:4:41,97
And then when we started skating
here, they would kind


118
0:4:41,97 --> 0:4:44,4
of give us a little
bit of static.


119
0:4:44,4 --> 0:4:46,55
I've got uncles from that
same neighborhood.


120
0:4:46,55 --> 0:4:50,7
And it turns out that my uncle
snatched them up and told them


121
0:4:50,7 --> 0:4:52,44
that's my nephew and
his friends.


122
0:4:52,44 --> 0:4:54,586
Those dudes are cool to skate
here whenever they want.


123
0:4:54,586 --> 0:4:56,54
And you know, back then
I wasn't even trying


124
0:4:56,54 --> 0:4:57,3
to look for no beef.


125
0:4:57,3 --> 0:4:58,23
We were just trying to skate.


126
0:4:58,23 --> 0:4:59,876
Trying to get away
from the beef.


127
0:4:59,876 --> 0:5:1,95
GUY MARIANO: These kids were
like the outcasts of


128
0:5:1,95 --> 0:5:3,56
skateboarding.


129
0:5:3,56 --> 0:5:4,9
They didn't have the skateboard


130
0:5:4,9 --> 0:5:7,43
image that people wanted.


131
0:5:7,43 --> 0:5:10,26
I really like the fact that
when Menace was started,


132
0:5:10,26 --> 0:5:13,2
Kareem was really good friends
with everybody in


133
0:5:13,2 --> 0:5:13,94
skateboarding.


134
0:5:13,94 --> 0:5:18,46
He could have handpicked just
top skaters, but he came for


135
0:5:18,46 --> 0:5:21,67
Billy, Joey, Eric Pupecki
and Fabian.


136
0:5:21,67 --> 0:5:22,57
It was the real thing.


137
0:5:22,57 --> 0:5:28,765
It was just like you guys are a
little crew, and I want it.


138
0:5:28,765 --> 0:5:32,25
ERIC PUPECKI: It was like kind
of the same thing as the


139
0:5:32,25 --> 0:5:32,91
deluxe deal.


140
0:5:32,91 --> 0:5:34,36
They don't know what
to do with me.


141
0:5:34,36 --> 0:5:35,64
That's what Menace
is all about.


142
0:5:35,64 --> 0:5:37,97
The team of guys that
no one knows what


143
0:5:37,97 --> 0:5:38,9
the fuck to do with.


144
0:5:38,9 --> 0:5:41,49
All right, I'll take
you, you and you.


145
0:5:41,49 --> 0:5:45,254
Boom, now we got a team or
misfits or whatever.


146
0:5:45,254 --> 0:5:47,42
-All you motherfucking
corns, eat.


147
0:5:47,42 --> 0:5:48,82
ERIC PUPECKI: Like I
said, no contracts.


148
0:5:48,82 --> 0:5:52,37
Not even like, hey Eric, would
you like to be on Menace


149
0:5:52,37 --> 0:5:53,37
skateboards?


150
0:5:53,37 --> 0:5:55,94
One day I'm on Menace now, I'm
hanging out with all of them,


151
0:5:55,94 --> 0:5:58,7
I'm on the team.


152
0:5:58,7 --> 0:6:0,57
So it was just kind
of nonchalant.


153
0:6:0,57 --> 0:6:2,68
So that's why there was
no real money either.


154
0:6:2,68 --> 0:6:4,65
It was just different times.


155
0:6:4,65 --> 0:6:6,585



156
0:6:6,585 --> 0:6:9,7
LEE SMITH: I skated for
ATM for about, I guess


157
0:6:9,7 --> 0:6:10,46
it was like a year.


158
0:6:10,46 --> 0:6:14,91
And that turned to 60/40
and kind of dissolved.


159
0:6:14,91 --> 0:6:18,66
And then when Joey and those
guys got with Kareem, I guess


160
0:6:18,66 --> 0:6:20,16
Kareem was looking for an am.


161
0:6:20,16 --> 0:6:22,9
And they were like well, we were
already skating with Lee


162
0:6:22,9 --> 0:6:24,34
on 60/40 at ATM, so let's
bring him over.


163
0:6:24,34 --> 0:6:27,4



164
0:6:27,4 --> 0:6:31,16
STEVEN CALES: I got out of
prison, right, and I'm hanging


165
0:6:31,16 --> 0:6:33,27
out with Maurice Key.


166
0:6:33,27 --> 0:6:35,77
He was going on a World
Menace tour.


167
0:6:35,77 --> 0:6:39,27
So I said, man, I'm just going
to go see my boys.


168
0:6:39,27 --> 0:6:43,31
So I'm on parole and I'm not
supposed to leave, but I know


169
0:6:43,31 --> 0:6:45,4
I could sneak away
for a weekend.


170
0:6:45,4 --> 0:6:47,27
I met up with Kareem
and all these guys.


171
0:6:47,27 --> 0:6:49,51
And so we went skating, and
we did those demos.


172
0:6:49,51 --> 0:6:52,1
I skated in the demos and
whatever, and I guess I skated


173
0:6:52,1 --> 0:6:55,16
good enough and maybe the World
went back to wherever it


174
0:6:55,16 --> 0:6:57,74
went to and I was on.


175
0:6:57,74 --> 0:7:0,4
I was on Menace and somebody
was like hey, this little


176
0:7:0,4 --> 0:7:1,33
kid's on Menace, too,
from out here.


177
0:7:1,33 --> 0:7:2,59
And I was like oh yeah, who?


178
0:7:2,59 --> 0:7:4,206
PATRICK O'DELL: What
did he look like?


179
0:7:4,206 --> 0:7:8,4
STEVEN CALES: He's just little
with big hands and big arms.


180
0:7:8,4 --> 0:7:8,87
He was a little pothead.


181
0:7:8,87 --> 0:7:11,26
I was like dang, this
is a bad ass kid.


182
0:7:11,26 --> 0:7:13,98
But it reminded me of me
because I was doing


183
0:7:13,98 --> 0:7:15,466
that at that age.


184
0:7:15,466 --> 0:7:17,78
JAVIER NUNEZ: Yeah, well I'm
not "Little Hob" no more.


185
0:7:17,78 --> 0:7:19,45
Everyone knows me
for Little Hob.


186
0:7:19,45 --> 0:7:21,8
It's been documented.


187
0:7:21,8 --> 0:7:25,74
So like I said, from 11 to 13
being in New York a lot of


188
0:7:25,74 --> 0:7:27,79
things were rolling for me.


189
0:7:27,79 --> 0:7:30,13
Me and Maurice were skating that
night and Kareem happened


190
0:7:30,13 --> 0:7:32,55
to see us do our thing.


191
0:7:32,55 --> 0:7:34,78
Got Maurice Key on
World Industries.


192
0:7:34,78 --> 0:7:40,37
And he put me on Menace before
it actually started, but it


193
0:7:40,37 --> 0:7:43,365
was in the process of becoming
the real thing.


194
0:7:43,365 --> 0:7:47,29
BILLY VALDES: We had plans for
Ivan Perez in Brooklyn.


195
0:7:47,29 --> 0:7:49,76
I wanted to get Rick Ibaseta
on the team.


196
0:7:49,76 --> 0:7:51,89
PATRICK O'DELL: Socrates was
saying that Shiloh was going


197
0:7:51,89 --> 0:7:53,43
to get on, too.


198
0:7:53,43 --> 0:7:54,95
Or, these was talk of
that or something.


199
0:7:54,95 --> 0:7:58,27
BILLY VALDES: That's between
Shiloh and Kareem.


200
0:7:58,27 --> 0:8:1,44
I don't know, I thought
at first it was, too.


201
0:8:1,44 --> 0:8:3,68
I think that was the
original plan.


202
0:8:3,68 --> 0:8:5,6
I don't know who changed it.


203
0:8:5,6 --> 0:8:7,1
Kareem's the mastermind.


204
0:8:7,1 --> 0:8:9,62
Like it said, if you look at
the bottom, [INAUDIBLE]


205
0:8:9,62 --> 0:8:12,91
Mastermind distribution and
he's lurking in the


206
0:8:12,91 --> 0:8:13,39
background.


207
0:8:13,39 --> 0:8:17,16
PATRICK O'DELL: Are they much
different from 101, Blind,


208
0:8:17,16 --> 0:8:17,775
Plan B, World?


209
0:8:17,775 --> 0:8:19,9
SOCRATES LEAL: Well, yeah,
image-wise definitely.


210
0:8:19,9 --> 0:8:22,28
Because right off the bat, it
seemed like their whole thing


211
0:8:22,28 --> 0:8:25,82
was a thugged out image,
the whole Menace.


212
0:8:25,82 --> 0:8:28,2
In the first one, I was like
beating up that kid.


213
0:8:28,2 --> 0:8:29,51
SOCRATES LEAL: Yeah,
that wasn't a skit.


214
0:8:29,51 --> 0:8:31,48
We were at Lockwood and that
was a friend of theirs.


215
0:8:31,48 --> 0:8:33,58
And for some reason they always
use to get off on


216
0:8:33,58 --> 0:8:35,21
hitting him really hard.


217
0:8:35,21 --> 0:8:38,2
So yeah, that day it started
off as something simple.


218
0:8:38,2 --> 0:8:42,2
And one of the dudes might let
a couple of those kicks or


219
0:8:42,2 --> 0:8:43,73
punches go a little too far.


220
0:8:43,73 --> 0:8:45,49
He got a little hurt
on that deal.


221
0:8:45,49 --> 0:8:48,4
I think maybe they thought they
had to put a little more


222
0:8:48,4 --> 0:8:49,62
effort into it because the
cameras were rolling.


223
0:8:49,62 --> 0:8:54,686



224
0:8:54,686 --> 0:8:57,9
JOEY SURIEL: Nothing was
scripted, everything was


225
0:8:57,9 --> 0:8:58,0
spontaneous.


226
0:8:58,0 --> 0:9:1,68
Before I can only probably count
two or three people that


227
0:9:1,68 --> 0:9:4,14
ever used hip-hop in
a skate video.


228
0:9:4,14 --> 0:9:8,84
Now looking back at those
specific times, it was just us


229
0:9:8,84 --> 0:9:13,89
really showing the skateboard
world skateboarding through


230
0:9:13,89 --> 0:9:16,266
our perspective.


231
0:9:16,266 --> 0:9:18,636
-Like this, like this, yeah.


232
0:9:18,636 --> 0:9:21,63
-Make it look like that,
bitch ass niggas.


233
0:9:21,63 --> 0:9:24,52
-And I'll be honest with you,
I never thought that we made


234
0:9:24,52 --> 0:9:28,71
the impact that obviously I've
come to know that we made.


235
0:9:28,71 --> 0:9:31,93
Just from the response that
we've been getting from all


236
0:9:31,93 --> 0:9:34,91
these people that we deal with
now on a different level.


237
0:9:34,91 --> 0:9:38,65
And say wow, I remember what an
impact it had on our lives.


238
0:9:38,65 --> 0:9:41,88
And we'd see that video part
over and over again every time


239
0:9:41,88 --> 0:9:42,9
we'd go out and skate.


240
0:9:42,9 --> 0:9:45,23
And I've said this before, I
don't think it had anything to


241
0:9:45,23 --> 0:9:49,2
do with cutting edge
skateboarding.


242
0:9:49,2 --> 0:9:52,17
But I think it had more to
do with the way we were


243
0:9:52,17 --> 0:9:54,44
presenting skateboarding.


244
0:9:54,44 --> 0:9:57,19
It wasn't like we were
inventing tricks.


245
0:9:57,19 --> 0:10:0,71
But it was like the stuff we put
out, it was quality and it


246
0:10:0,71 --> 0:10:3,47
was genuine.


247
0:10:3,47 --> 0:10:5,51
-I think Valele thought Joey
was skating around with a


248
0:10:5,51 --> 0:10:8,53
blunt around on the course.


249
0:10:8,53 --> 0:10:10,67
-I think he thought a lot
of our behavior was


250
0:10:10,67 --> 0:10:11,7
inappropriate.


251
0:10:11,7 --> 0:10:14,31
-Back in those days,
skateboarders shouldn't


252
0:10:14,31 --> 0:10:17,72
represent themselves that way,
which I think is corny.


253
0:10:17,72 --> 0:10:23,6
Because I mean, you look at
fucking old Alva Dogtown Days.


254
0:10:23,6 --> 0:10:30,5
We just kind of pulled an Alva
move in the '90s, I guess.


255
0:10:30,5 --> 0:10:31,3
Got psyched on ourselves.


256
0:10:31,3 --> 0:12:31,3
