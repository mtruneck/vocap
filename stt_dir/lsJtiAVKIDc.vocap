###11 RYAN DUFFY: So we're here in Bolivar Square in the middle
###12 of central Caracas.
###13 As you might be able to tell from the cathedral behind me,
###16 Venezuela is, like most Latin American countries,
###18 predominantly Catholic.
###19 Now the interesting bit here is there's a good bit of kind
###22 of Santeria and spiritism in the mix as well.
###24 And we've recently found a particular group of Saints
###27 that fascinates us.
###28 They're called the Santos Malandros, translated roughly
###31 as the Holy Thugs.
###33 Now, it's either kind of perfect or really troubling
###36 that in Caracas, widely regarded as the world's most
###39 violent city, the Venezuelan people are worshipping at the
###42 feet of tiny statues of now dead armed criminals.
###45 
###57 Over 14,000 people were killed in Venezuela last year.
###60 And Caracas has the highest murder rate per
###62 capita in the world.
###64 Hugo Chavez's Bolivarian Revolution may have reduced
###67 poverty in this oil-rich country, but he's yet to bring
###70 any sense of safety or security to the streets.
###73 It's in the middle of all this violence that the cult of the
###75 Holy Thugs was born.
###78 The Holy Thugs are part of a very unique mix of Catholicism
###81 and spiritism.
###82 So we first visited with sociologist Tulio Hernandez to
###85 try and get our heads around it.
###88 TULIO HERNANDEZ: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###90 
###120 RYAN DUFFY: He explained that the main goddess of Venezuela
###122 spiritism is Maria Lionza, who is represented, of course, as
###126 a naked lady riding what looks to be an anteater.
###130 Maria Lionza, essentially the queen of all spirits.
###135 Below her there's a whole bunch of other saints grouped
###138 into courts.
###139 There's the court of doctors, of Indians, of Africans, of
###142 Vikings, and even of revolutionaries.
###144 TULIO HERNANDEZ: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###146 
###165 RYAN DUFFY: Every court has a leader.
###166 And the leader of the Court de Malandro or the Court of the
###169 Thugs is Ismael Sanchez.
###172 So it's mid-afternoon and we just got to the cemetery here
###174 in Caracas.
###175 And right over here is where Ishmael Sanchez is buried,
###180 along with the other members of the Holy Thugs.
###183 And this is where everyone comes to kind
###185 of pay their respects.

###228 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###230 
###247 RYAN DUFFY: At the cemetery, we met Omar, the unofficial
###249 caretaker of Ismael's shrine, and his buddies, Johann and
###253 Vamonde, who both seem to be spiritism
###255 priests of some sort.
###257 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

###276 
###286 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###287 
###297 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###298 
###305 RYAN DUFFY: We talked a lot about Ismael.
###307 There's, you know, another few saints in similar fashion who
###311 are part of this group.
###313 Can you tell us about some of the others?
###314 Like, who is that right there?
###316 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###318 
###349 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###351 
###384 RYAN DUFFY: About how many people are coming through a
###386 day to pay respects, or to celebrate, or
###390 whatever they're doing?
###391 And how long are they staying?
###392 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###394 
###410 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###411 
###422 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###423 
###434 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###436 
###460 RYAN DUFFY: At some point, we saw a funeral
###461 procession drive by.
###462 And we were told that it was a kid murdered in the nearby
###465 slums that weekend.
###466 Soon after, we heard a few rounds of automatic weapon
###469 fire and decided it was time to leave.
###471 [GUNSHOTS]
###473 TULIO HERNANDEZ: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###474 
###486 RYAN DUFFY: So leaving the cemetery just now, we drove by
###489 this shop and noticed they have a bunch of the Holy Thugs
###491 displayed in front.
###492 So we're going to pop in, and go check them out, and see if
###495 we can meet the folks who run the place.
###496 
###503 We met the shop owner, a spiritist named Clara, who
###505 said she could only talk to us with Ismael's permission.
###508 So she went back to her alter to ask.
###511 It's a boy Ismael.
###513 It's the leader the pack and the rest of the pack as well.
###518 This is Antonio.
###520 He's got a pretty serious scar.
###522 It's kind of right in there above his eye.
###526 That's a knife fight that Antonio got in.
###529 Fresh out of the Thunderbird.
###532 It's the one Holy Thug who came from Jersey, Johnny.
###537 Domicito, that's a serious dude.
###542 He also has the Nike hat.
###543 
###547 He's perhaps a little more devious than the rest.
###550 He's somewhat concealing his weapon.
###555 Clara eventually invited us back, where she actually
###558 offered to channel Ismael himself for us.
###561 CLARA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###563 
###611 RYAN DUFFY: Yeah.
###612 I mean, I'm very interested by it, certainly.
###614 CLARA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###616 
###626 RYAN DUFFY: You can see that just by looking at me?
###628 CLARA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###630 
###641 RYAN DUFFY: We said goodbye to Clara, picked up some statues,
###643 and got on our way.
###646 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###647 
###662 RYAN DUFFY: For many Venezuelans, living in poverty
###664 and amidst all of this violence, believing in the
###666 pure and perfect Catholic saints is a bit more of a
###669 stretch than believing in the more familiar and flawed
###671 figureheads like Ismael.
