0:0:6,895 --> 0:0:10,911
(ChÃ¶gyam Trungpa Rinpoche)
Spirituality


2
0:0:10,911 --> 0:0:17,391
is a particular term
which actually means


3
0:0:17,391 --> 0:0:24,92
a dealing with intuition.


4
0:0:24,92 --> 0:0:27,565
In the theistic tradition


5
0:0:27,565 --> 0:0:34,165
there is a notion of
clinging into a word.


6
0:0:34,165 --> 0:0:38,238
A certain act is regarded as


7
0:0:38,238 --> 0:0:42,623
displeasing to our
divine principles.


8
0:0:42,623 --> 0:0:50,136
A certain act is regarded as
pleasing for the divine whatever.


9
0:0:50,136 --> 0:0:53,417
In the tradition of
non-theism, however


10
0:0:53,417 --> 0:0:56,301
it is very direct


11
0:0:56,301 --> 0:1:0,14
that the case history is not
particularly important.


12
0:1:0,14 --> 0:1:6,174
What is actually important
is here and now.


13
0:1:6,174 --> 0:1:9,364
Now is definitely now.


14
0:1:9,364 --> 0:1:17,515
We try to experience what is
available there, on the spot.


15
0:1:17,515 --> 0:1:22,26
There's no point in thinking
that a past did exist


16
0:1:22,26 --> 0:1:25,95
that we could have now.


17
0:1:25,95 --> 0:1:28,47
This is now.


18
0:1:28,47 --> 0:1:30,976
This very moment.


19
0:1:30,976 --> 0:1:36,282
Nothing mystical, just now,
very simple, straight forward.


20
0:1:36,282 --> 0:1:39,119
And from that nowness, however


21
0:1:39,119 --> 0:1:44,662
arises a sense of
intelligence, always


22
0:1:44,662 --> 0:1:49,148
that you are constantly
interacting with reality


23
0:1:49,148 --> 0:1:53,453
one by one, spot by
spot, constantly.


24
0:1:53,453 --> 0:2:0,379
We actually experience
fantastic precision, always.


25
0:2:0,379 --> 0:2:2,95
But we are threatened by the now


26
0:2:2,95 --> 0:2:9,626
so we jump to the
past or the future.


27
0:2:9,626 --> 0:2:15,882
Paying attention to the materials
that exist in our life


28
0:2:15,882 --> 0:2:19,767
all these choices take
place all the time


29
0:2:19,767 --> 0:2:24,31
but none of them are regarded
as bad or good per se.


30
0:2:24,31 --> 0:2:27,838
Everything we experience are
unconditional experience.


31
0:2:27,838 --> 0:2:30,513
They don't come along
with a label by saying


32
0:2:30,513 --> 0:2:34,895
"This is regarded as
bad" or "This is good".


33
0:2:34,895 --> 0:2:40,561
We experience them but we don't
actually pay heed to them properly.


34
0:2:40,561 --> 0:2:44,514
We don't actually regard that
as we are going somewhere.


35
0:2:44,514 --> 0:2:47,9
We regard that as a hassle


36
0:2:47,9 --> 0:2:50,312
waiting to be dead.


37
0:2:50,312 --> 0:3:3,951
[Echoed: waiting to be dead]


38
0:3:3,951 --> 0:3:9,492
That's a problem. And that is not
trusting the nowness properly


39
0:3:9,492 --> 0:3:12,451
that what is actually
experienced now


40
0:3:12,451 --> 0:3:17,561
possesses a lot of
powerful things.


41
0:3:17,561 --> 0:3:20,533
It is so powerful


42
0:3:20,533 --> 0:3:23,4
that we can't face it.


43
0:3:23,4 --> 0:3:29,95
Therefore, we have to borrow from the
past, invite the future, all the time


44
0:3:29,95 --> 0:3:34,171
and maybe that's why
we seek religion.


45
0:3:34,171 --> 0:3:39,129
Maybe that's why we
march in the street.


46
0:3:39,129 --> 0:3:44,25
Maybe that's why we
complain to society.


47
0:3:44,25 --> 0:3:50,994
Maybe that's why we vote
for the presidents.


48
0:3:50,994 --> 0:8:43,451
It is quite ironical and
very funny, indeed.


49
0:8:43,451 --> 0:9:8,467
ZEITGEIST


50
0:9:8,467 --> 0:9:12,288
(J. Maxwell) 
The more you
begin to investigate


51
0:9:12,288 --> 0:9:15,602
what we think we understand,
where we came from


52
0:9:15,602 --> 0:9:18,23
what we think we're doing


53
0:9:18,23 --> 0:9:21,83
the more you begin to
see we've been lied to.


54
0:9:21,83 --> 0:9:25,99
We've been lied to by every institution.
What makes you think


55
0:9:25,99 --> 0:9:28,174
for one minute, that the
religious institution


56
0:9:28,174 --> 0:9:30,951
is the only one that's
never been touched?


57
0:9:30,951 --> 0:9:38,23
The religious institutions of this
world are at the bottom of the dirt.


58
0:9:38,23 --> 0:9:42,502
The religious institutions
in this world are put there


59
0:9:42,502 --> 0:9:46,712
by the same people who gave you your
government, your corrupt education


60
0:9:46,712 --> 0:9:50,9
who set up your international
banking cartels.


61
0:9:50,9 --> 0:9:55,221
We have been misled away from
the true and divine presence


62
0:9:55,221 --> 0:9:58,262
in the universe that
men have called God.


63
0:9:58,262 --> 0:10:1,745
I don't know what God is
but I know what He isn't.


64
0:10:1,745 --> 0:10:6,712
And unless and until you are
prepared to look at the whole truth


65
0:10:6,712 --> 0:10:10,616
wherever it may go,
whoever it may lead to


66
0:10:10,616 --> 0:10:13,332
the more you educate yourself,
the more you understand


67
0:10:13,332 --> 0:10:16,336
where things come from, the
more obvious things become


68
0:10:16,336 --> 0:10:20,126
and you begin to see lies everywhere.
You have to know the truth


69
0:10:20,126 --> 0:10:23,487
and seek the truth and the
truth will set you free.


70
0:10:23,487 --> 0:10:27,408
They must find it difficult...


71
0:10:27,408 --> 0:10:32,9
Those who have taken
authority as the truth


72
0:10:32,9 --> 0:10:35,841
rather than truth
as the authority.


73
0:10:35,841 --> 0:11:16,895
G. Massey, Egyptologist


74
0:11:16,895 --> 0:11:23,67
(G. Carlin)
Because I have to
tell you the truth, folks.


75
0:11:23,67 --> 0:11:26,17
When it comes to bullshit


76
0:11:26,17 --> 0:11:29,866
big time, major league bullshit


77
0:11:29,866 --> 0:11:34,587
you have to stand in awe of the
all-time champion of false promises


78
0:11:34,587 --> 0:11:40,291
and exaggerated
claims: religion!


79
0:11:40,291 --> 0:11:45,65
Think about it.
Religion has actually convinced people


80
0:11:45,65 --> 0:11:49,583
that there's an invisible
man living in the sky


81
0:11:49,583 --> 0:11:53,44
who watches everything you do,
every minute of every day.


82
0:11:53,44 --> 0:11:57,37
And the invisible man has a
special list of ten things


83
0:11:57,37 --> 0:11:59,726
he does not want you to do.


84
0:11:59,726 --> 0:12:3,402
And if you do any of these ten
things, he has a special place


85
0:12:3,402 --> 0:12:7,9
full of fire and smoke and
burning and torture and anguish


86
0:12:7,9 --> 0:12:10,406
where He will send you to live
and suffer and burn and choke


87
0:12:10,406 --> 0:12:17,37
and scream and cry forever and
ever until the end of time!


88
0:12:17,37 --> 0:12:19,939
But He loves you.


89
0:12:19,939 --> 0:12:25,692
[Laughter and applause]


90
0:12:25,692 --> 0:12:30,124
He loves you.


91
0:12:30,124 --> 0:12:34,868
He loves you and He needs money!


92
0:12:34,868 --> 0:12:37,472
He always needs money!


93
0:12:37,472 --> 0:12:40,342
He's all-powerful, all-perfect,
all-knowing, and all-wise;


94
0:12:40,342 --> 0:12:45,31
somehow, just can't
handle money!


95
0:12:45,31 --> 0:12:48,398
Religion takes in
billions of dollars


96
0:12:48,398 --> 0:12:52,561
they pay no taxes and they
always need a little more.


97
0:12:52,561 --> 0:12:55,919
Now, you talk about a
good bullshit story.


98
0:12:55,919 --> 0:13:5,479
Holy shit!


99
0:13:5,479 --> 0:13:9,18
PART I:


100
0:13:9,18 --> 0:13:38,56
The Greatest Story Ever Told


101
0:13:38,56 --> 0:13:41,291
(P. Joseph)
This is the sun.


102
0:13:41,291 --> 0:13:43,624
As far back as 10,000 BC


103
0:13:43,624 --> 0:13:47,573
history is abundant with carvings and
writings reflecting people's respect


104
0:13:47,573 --> 0:13:50,642
and adoration for this object.


105
0:13:50,642 --> 0:13:53,179
And it is simple to understand
why, as every morning


106
0:13:53,179 --> 0:13:56,204
the sun would rise, bringing
vision, warmth and security


107
0:13:56,204 --> 0:14:1,7
saving man from the cold, blind,
predator-filled darkness of night.


108
0:14:1,7 --> 0:14:4,168
Without it, the cultures understood,
the crops would not grow


109
0:14:4,168 --> 0:14:7,166
and life on the planet
would not survive.


110
0:14:7,166 --> 0:14:13,736
These realities made the sun the
most adored object of all time.


111
0:14:13,736 --> 0:14:17,321
Likewise, they were also
very aware of the stars.


112
0:14:17,321 --> 0:14:20,88
The tracking of the stars allowed them
to recognize and anticipate events


113
0:14:20,88 --> 0:14:23,376
which occurred over
long periods of time


114
0:14:23,376 --> 0:14:25,884
such as eclipses and full moons.


115
0:14:25,884 --> 0:14:27,873
They in turn cataloged
celestial groups


116
0:14:27,873 --> 0:14:33,714
into what we know today
as constellations.


117
0:14:33,714 --> 0:14:35,666
This is the cross of the Zodiac


118
0:14:35,666 --> 0:14:39,323
one of the oldest conceptual
images in human history.


119
0:14:39,323 --> 0:14:41,995
It reflects the sun as
it figuratively passes


120
0:14:41,995 --> 0:14:46,358
through the 12 major constellations
over the course of a year.


121
0:14:46,358 --> 0:14:49,773
It also reflects the 12 months
of the year, the four seasons


122
0:14:49,773 --> 0:14:52,949
and the solstices and equinoxes.


123
0:14:52,949 --> 0:14:55,973
The term Zodiac relates to
the fact that constellations


124
0:14:55,973 --> 0:15:1,782
were anthropomorphized or
personified as figures or animals.


125
0:15:1,782 --> 0:15:5,561
In other words, the early civilizations
did not just follow the sun and stars


126
0:15:5,561 --> 0:15:7,941
they personified them
with elaborate myths


127
0:15:7,941 --> 0:15:11,246
involving their movements
and relationships.


128
0:15:11,246 --> 0:15:14,86
The sun, with its life-giving
and saving qualities


129
0:15:14,86 --> 0:15:18,5
was personified as a representative
of the unseen creator or God.


130
0:15:18,5 --> 0:15:23,89
God's Sun: the Light of the world,
the Savior of human kind.


131
0:15:23,89 --> 0:15:27,36
Likewise, the 12 constellations represented
places of travel for God's Sun


132
0:15:27,36 --> 0:15:30,685
and were identified by names, usually
representing elements of nature


133
0:15:30,685 --> 0:15:32,95
that happened during
that period of time.


134
0:15:32,95 --> 0:15:42,204
For example, Aquarius the water
bearer, who brings the spring rains.


135
0:15:42,204 --> 0:15:47,374
This is Horus. He is the Sun God
of Egypt of around 3000 BC.


136
0:15:47,374 --> 0:15:50,23
He is the sun,
anthropomorphized and his life


137
0:15:50,23 --> 0:15:54,25
is a series of allegorical myths
involving the sun's movement in the sky.


138
0:15:54,25 --> 0:15:56,679
From the ancient
hieroglyphics in Egypt


139
0:15:56,679 --> 0:15:58,95
we know much about
this solar messiah.


140
0:15:58,95 --> 0:16:1,598
For instance, Horus, being
the sun or the light


141
0:16:1,598 --> 0:16:5,368
had an enemy known as Set
who was the personification


142
0:16:5,368 --> 0:16:7,823
of the darkness or night


143
0:16:7,823 --> 0:16:10,26
and metaphorically
speaking, every morning


144
0:16:10,26 --> 0:16:13,923
Horus would win the battle against
Set, while in the evening


145
0:16:13,923 --> 0:16:19,295
Set would conquer Horus and
send him into the underworld.


146
0:16:19,295 --> 0:16:22,922
It is important to note that 'dark vs.
light' or 'good vs. evil'


147
0:16:22,922 --> 0:16:27,61
is one of the most ubiquitous
mythological dualities ever known


148
0:16:27,61 --> 0:16:30,92
and is still expressed on
many levels to this day.


149
0:16:30,92 --> 0:16:34,903
Broadly speaking, the story
of Horus is as follows:


150
0:16:34,903 --> 0:16:39,549
Horus was born on December 25th of the Virgin Isis
- Mary


151
0:16:39,549 --> 0:16:42,652
His birth was accompanied
by a star in the east


152
0:16:42,652 --> 0:16:46,842
and upon his birth he was
adored by three kings.


153
0:16:46,842 --> 0:16:49,57
At the age of 12, he was a
prodigal child teacher.


154
0:16:49,57 --> 0:16:52,814
At the age of 30 he was baptized
by a figure known as Anup


155
0:16:52,814 --> 0:16:57,66
and thus began his ministry.
Horus had 12 disciples he traveled about with


156
0:16:57,66 --> 0:17:0,644
performing miracles such as healing
the sick and walking on water.


157
0:17:0,644 --> 0:17:3,774
Horus was known by many gestural
names such as The Truth


158
0:17:3,774 --> 0:17:6,822
The Light, God's Anointed
Son, The Good Shepherd


159
0:17:6,822 --> 0:17:9,571
The Lamb of God and many others.


160
0:17:9,571 --> 0:17:12,965
After being betrayed by
Typhon, Horus was crucified


161
0:17:12,965 --> 0:17:18,859
buried for 3 days and
thus, resurrected.


162
0:17:18,859 --> 0:17:21,643
These attributes of Horus,
whether original or not


163
0:17:21,643 --> 0:17:24,906
seem to permeate in many cultures
of the world for many other gods


164
0:17:24,906 --> 0:17:28,649
are found to have the same
general mythological structure.


165
0:17:28,649 --> 0:17:32,233
Attis of Phrygia, born of the
Virgin Nana on December 25th


166
0:17:32,233 --> 0:17:37,504
crucified, placed in a tomb and
after three days, was resurrected.


167
0:17:37,504 --> 0:17:40,324
Krishna of India, born
of the Virgin Devaki


168
0:17:40,324 --> 0:17:43,11
with a star in the east
signaling his coming.


169
0:17:43,11 --> 0:17:46,882
He performed miracles with his
disciples and upon his death


170
0:17:46,882 --> 0:17:50,88
was resurrected.


171
0:17:50,88 --> 0:17:54,193
Dionysus of Greece, born of
a virgin on December 25th


172
0:17:54,193 --> 0:17:58,25
was a traveling teacher who performed
miracles such as turning water into wine.


173
0:17:58,25 --> 0:18:1,54
He was referred to as The King of
Kings, God's only begotten son


174
0:18:1,54 --> 0:18:5,4
the Alpha and Omega and many others.
Upon his death


175
0:18:5,4 --> 0:18:7,242
he was resurrected.


176
0:18:7,242 --> 0:18:10,83
Mithra of Persia, born of
a virgin on December 25th


177
0:18:10,83 --> 0:18:13,381
had 12 disciples and
performed miracles


178
0:18:13,381 --> 0:18:17,8
upon his death was buried for
3 days and thus resurrected.


179
0:18:17,8 --> 0:18:20,448
He was also referred to as the
truth, the light and many others.


180
0:18:20,448 --> 0:18:27,416
Interestingly, the sacred day of
worship of Mithra was Sunday.


181
0:18:27,416 --> 0:18:30,44
The fact of the matter is
there are numerous saviors


182
0:18:30,44 --> 0:18:32,638
from different periods
from all over the world


183
0:18:32,638 --> 0:18:36,59
which subscribe to these
general characteristics.


184
0:18:36,59 --> 0:18:39,283
The question remains:
why these attributes?


185
0:18:39,283 --> 0:18:41,704
Why the virgin birth
on December 25th?


186
0:18:41,704 --> 0:18:44,323
Why dead for 3 days and the
inevitable resurrection?


187
0:18:44,323 --> 0:18:47,104
Why 12 disciples or followers?


188
0:18:47,104 --> 0:18:54,292
To find out, let's examine the
most recent of the solar messiahs.


189
0:18:54,292 --> 0:18:57,74
Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin
Mary on December 25th in Bethlehem.


190
0:18:57,74 --> 0:19:0,87
His birth was announced by a star in
the east which Three Kings or Magi


191
0:19:0,87 --> 0:19:3,369
followed to locate and
adore the new savior.


192
0:19:3,369 --> 0:19:6,115
He was a child teacher at 12.
At the age of 30 he was baptized


193
0:19:6,115 --> 0:19:10,51
by John the Baptist and
thus began his ministry.


194
0:19:10,51 --> 0:19:12,915
Jesus had 12 disciples which he
traveled about with performing miracles


195
0:19:12,915 --> 0:19:15,934
such as healing the sick, walking
on water, raising the dead.


196
0:19:15,934 --> 0:19:19,26
He was also known as the King of Kings,
the Son of God, the Light of the World


197
0:19:19,26 --> 0:19:21,556
the Alpha and Omega, the
Lamb of God and many others.


198
0:19:21,556 --> 0:19:23,984
After being betrayed by his
disciple Judas and sold


199
0:19:23,984 --> 0:19:26,88
for 30 pieces of silver, he was
crucified, placed in a tomb


200
0:19:26,88 --> 0:19:35,301
and after 3 days was resurrected
and ascended into heaven.


201
0:19:35,301 --> 0:19:40,28
First of all, the birth sequence
is completely astrological.


202
0:19:40,28 --> 0:19:43,643
The star in the east is Sirius, the
brightest star in the night sky


203
0:19:43,643 --> 0:19:49,7
which on December 24th aligns with the
3 brightest stars in Orion's belt.


204
0:19:49,7 --> 0:19:51,9
These 3 bright stars in the
Orion's belt are called today


205
0:19:51,9 --> 0:19:56,137
what they were called in ancient
times 'The Three Kings'.


206
0:19:56,137 --> 0:19:59,336
And the Three Kings and the
brightest star, Sirius


207
0:19:59,336 --> 0:20:3,774
all point to the place of the
sunrise on December 25th.


208
0:20:3,774 --> 0:20:7,693
This is why the Three Kings
follow the star in the east


209
0:20:7,693 --> 0:20:17,567
in order to locate the sunrise,
the birth of the Sun.


210
0:20:17,567 --> 0:20:21,967
The Virgin Mary is the constellation
Virgo also known as Virgo the Virgin.


211
0:20:21,967 --> 0:20:25,35
Virgo in Latin means Virgin.


212
0:20:25,35 --> 0:20:28,415
Virgo was also referred
to as the House of Bread


213
0:20:28,415 --> 0:20:32,71
and the representation of Virgo is
a virgin holding a sheaf of wheat.


214
0:20:32,71 --> 0:20:34,619
This house of bread and
its symbol of wheat


215
0:20:34,619 --> 0:20:37,567
represents August and September,
the time of harvest.


216
0:20:37,567 --> 0:20:42,664
In turn, Bethlehem literally
translates to "house of bread".


217
0:20:42,664 --> 0:20:46,6
Bethlehem is thus a reference
to the constellation Virgo


218
0:20:46,6 --> 0:20:49,363
a place in the sky,
not on earth.


219
0:20:49,363 --> 0:20:51,52
There's another very
interesting phenomenon


220
0:20:51,52 --> 0:20:54,734
that occurs around December
25th or the winter solstice.


221
0:20:54,734 --> 0:20:57,43
From the summer solstice
to the winter solstice


222
0:20:57,43 --> 0:20:59,6
the days become
shorter and colder.


223
0:20:59,6 --> 0:21:1,414
And from the perspective
of the northern hemisphere


224
0:21:1,414 --> 0:21:4,854
the Sun appears to move south and
gets smaller and more scarce.


225
0:21:4,854 --> 0:21:7,769
The shortening of the days
and expiration of the crops


226
0:21:7,769 --> 0:21:11,239
when approaching the winter solstice
symbolized the process of death


227
0:21:11,239 --> 0:21:17,85
to the ancients.
It was the death of the Sun.


228
0:21:17,85 --> 0:21:21,617
And by December 22nd the Sun's
demise was fully realized.


229
0:21:21,617 --> 0:21:25,5
For the Sun having moved south
continually for six months


230
0:21:25,5 --> 0:21:28,349
makes it to its lowest
point in the sky.


231
0:21:28,349 --> 0:21:30,632
Here a curious thing occurs:


232
0:21:30,632 --> 0:21:36,178
The Sun stops moving south, at
least perceivably, for three days.


233
0:21:36,178 --> 0:21:39,744
And during this three day pause,
the Sun resides in the vicinity


234
0:21:39,744 --> 0:21:44,244
of the Southern Cross,
or Crux constellation.


235
0:21:44,244 --> 0:21:46,972
And after this time
on December 25th


236
0:21:46,972 --> 0:21:50,84
the Sun moves one
degree, this time north


237
0:21:50,84 --> 0:21:54,872
foreshadowing longer
days, warmth and spring.


238
0:21:54,872 --> 0:21:59,224
And thus it was said:
The Son died on a cross


239
0:21:59,224 --> 0:22:4,556
was dead for three days, only to
be resurrected or born again.


240
0:22:4,556 --> 0:22:7,559
This is why Jesus and
numerous other Sun gods


241
0:22:7,559 --> 0:22:12,682
share the crucifixion, three-day
death and resurrection concept.


242
0:22:12,682 --> 0:22:16,671
It is the Sun's transition period
before it shifts its direction back


243
0:22:16,671 --> 0:22:21,57
into the northern hemisphere,
bringing spring and thus salvation.


244
0:22:21,57 --> 0:22:24,325
However, they did not celebrate
the resurrection of the Sun


245
0:22:24,325 --> 0:22:27,643
until the spring
equinox or Easter.


246
0:22:27,643 --> 0:22:31,668
This is because at the spring equinox,
the Sun officially overpowers


247
0:22:31,668 --> 0:22:36,61
the evil darkness as daytime
thereafter becomes longer in duration


248
0:22:36,61 --> 0:22:41,364
than the night and the revitalizing
conditions of spring emerge.


249
0:22:41,364 --> 0:22:44,725
Probably the most obvious of
all the astrological symbolism


250
0:22:44,725 --> 0:22:47,94
around Jesus regards
the 12 disciples.


251
0:22:47,94 --> 0:22:50,818
They are simply the 12
constellations of the zodiac


252
0:22:50,818 --> 0:22:58,153
which Jesus, being the
Sun, travels about with.


253
0:22:58,153 --> 0:23:6,297
In fact, the number 12 is
replete throughout the Bible.


254
0:23:6,297 --> 0:23:11,5
Coming back to the cross of the zodiac,
the figurative life of the Sun


255
0:23:11,5 --> 0:23:14,18
this was not just an
artistic expression


256
0:23:14,18 --> 0:23:16,934
or tool to track the
Sun's movement.


257
0:23:16,934 --> 0:23:20,234
It was also a pagan
spiritual symbol


258
0:23:20,234 --> 0:23:25,92
the shorthand of which
looked like this.


259
0:23:25,92 --> 0:23:28,83
This is not a symbol
of Christianity.


260
0:23:28,83 --> 0:23:43,575
It is a pagan adaptation of
the cross of the zodiac.


261
0:23:43,575 --> 0:23:46,553
This is why Jesus in earlier
cult art is always shown


262
0:23:46,553 --> 0:23:51,45
with his head on the cross
for Jesus is the Sun.


263
0:23:51,45 --> 0:23:55,672
The Son of God, the Light of
the World, the risen Savior


264
0:23:55,672 --> 0:23:59,416
who will come again as
it does every morning


265
0:23:59,416 --> 0:24:4,334
of the glory of God, who defends
against the works of darkness


266
0:24:4,334 --> 0:24:7,496
as he is born again
every morning


267
0:24:7,496 --> 0:24:10,86
and can be seen
coming in the clouds


268
0:24:10,86 --> 0:24:12,985
up in heaven


269
0:24:12,985 --> 0:24:23,7
with his crown of
thorns or sun rays.


270
0:24:23,7 --> 0:24:28,743
Of the many astrological/astronomical
metaphors in the Bible


271
0:24:28,743 --> 0:24:32,368
one of the most important
has to do with the ages.


272
0:24:32,368 --> 0:24:36,639
Throughout the scriptures, there are
numerous references to the age.


273
0:24:36,639 --> 0:24:39,923
In order to understand this, we need
to be familiar with the phenomenon


274
0:24:39,923 --> 0:24:43,361
known as the precession
of the equinoxes.


275
0:24:43,361 --> 0:24:46,549
The ancient Egyptians, along
with cultures long before them


276
0:24:46,549 --> 0:24:49,887
recognized that approximately
every 2150 years


277
0:24:49,887 --> 0:24:52,48
the sunrise on the morning
of the spring equinox


278
0:24:52,48 --> 0:24:56,316
would occur at a different
sign of the zodiac.


279
0:24:56,316 --> 0:24:58,782
This has to do with a
slow angular wobble


280
0:24:58,782 --> 0:25:2,381
that the Earth maintains
as it rotates on its axis.


281
0:25:2,381 --> 0:25:5,501
It is called a precession because
the constellations go backwards


282
0:25:5,501 --> 0:25:8,1
rather than through the
normal yearly cycle.


283
0:25:8,1 --> 0:25:11,353
The amount of time it takes for the
precession to go through all 12 signs


284
0:25:11,353 --> 0:25:15,294
is roughly 25,765 years.


285
0:25:15,294 --> 0:25:18,15
This is also called
the great year


286
0:25:18,15 --> 0:25:20,855
and ancient societies
were very aware of this


287
0:25:20,855 --> 0:25:27,414
and they referred to each
2150 year period as an age.


288
0:25:27,414 --> 0:25:32,413
From 4300 BC
- 2150 BC, it was the age of Taurus, the Bull.


289
0:25:32,413 --> 0:25:37,242
From 2150 BC
- 1 AD, it was the age of Aries, the Ram.


290
0:25:37,242 --> 0:25:41,384
And from 1 AD
- 2150 AD, it is the age of Pisces


291
0:25:41,384 --> 0:25:45,147
the age we are still
in to this day.


292
0:25:45,147 --> 0:25:48,616
And in and around 2150 we
will enter the new age


293
0:25:48,616 --> 0:25:52,474
the age of Aquarius.


294
0:25:52,474 --> 0:25:56,113
The Bible reflects broadly
speaking a symbolic movement


295
0:25:56,113 --> 0:26:0,112
through three ages while
foreshadowing a fourth.


296
0:26:0,112 --> 0:26:2,971
In the Old Testament when
Moses comes down Mount Sinai


297
0:26:2,971 --> 0:26:5,355
with the Ten Commandments,
he is very upset


298
0:26:5,355 --> 0:26:9,417
to see his people worshiping
a golden bull calf.


299
0:26:9,417 --> 0:26:12,82
In fact, he shattered the stone
tablets and instructed his people


300
0:26:12,82 --> 0:26:16,152
to kill each other in order
to purify themselves.


301
0:26:16,152 --> 0:26:20,428
Most Biblical scholars will attribute this
anger to the fact that the Israelites


302
0:26:20,428 --> 0:26:23,63
were worshiping a false idol
or something to that effect.


303
0:26:23,63 --> 0:26:27,428
The reality is, the golden
bull is Taurus the Bull


304
0:26:27,428 --> 0:26:31,226
and Moses represents the
new age of Aries the Ram.


305
0:26:31,226 --> 0:26:34,718
This is why Jews even today
still blow the ram's horn.


306
0:26:34,718 --> 0:26:37,978
Moses represents the
new age of Aries


307
0:26:37,978 --> 0:26:42,36
and upon the new age everyone
must shed the old age.


308
0:26:42,36 --> 0:26:45,989
Other deities mark these
transitions as well such as Mithra


309
0:26:45,989 --> 0:26:51,335
a pre-Christian god who kills
the bull in the same symbology.


310
0:26:51,335 --> 0:26:55,338
Jesus is the figure who ushers
in the age following Aries


311
0:26:55,338 --> 0:26:59,498
the Age of Pisces
or the two fish.


312
0:26:59,498 --> 0:27:2,552
Fish symbolism is very
abundant in the New Testament.


313
0:27:2,552 --> 0:27:8,8
Jesus feeds 5,000 people
with bread and two fish.


314
0:27:8,8 --> 0:27:11,193
When he begins his ministry
walking along Galilee


315
0:27:11,193 --> 0:27:15,16
he befriends two fishermen
who follow him.


316
0:27:15,16 --> 0:27:18,988
And I think we have all seen the "Jesus
fish" on the back of people's cars.


317
0:27:18,988 --> 0:27:22,298
Little do they know
what it actually means.


318
0:27:22,298 --> 0:27:25,373
It is a pagan
astrological symbolism


319
0:27:25,373 --> 0:27:30,516
for the Sun's kingdom
during the age of Pisces.


320
0:27:30,516 --> 0:27:37,354
Also, Jesus' assumed birth date is
essentially the start of this age.


321
0:27:37,354 --> 0:27:40,908
At Luke 22:10 when Jesus
is asked by his disciples


322
0:27:40,908 --> 0:27:43,464
where the last Passover would be


323
0:27:43,464 --> 0:27:48,176
Jesus replies "Behold, when
ye are entered into the city


324
0:27:48,176 --> 0:27:51,915
there shall a man meet you
bearing a pitcher of water


325
0:27:51,915 --> 0:27:55,688
follow him into the house
where he entereth in."


326
0:27:55,688 --> 0:27:58,233
This scripture is by far
one of the most revealing


327
0:27:58,233 --> 0:28:1,54
of all the astrological
references.


328
0:28:1,54 --> 0:28:3,932
The man bearing a pitcher
of water is Aquarius


329
0:28:3,932 --> 0:28:7,116
the water-bearer, who is
always pictured as a man


330
0:28:7,116 --> 0:28:9,734
pouring out a pitcher of water.


331
0:28:9,734 --> 0:28:12,34
He represents the
age after Pisces


332
0:28:12,34 --> 0:28:16,944
and when the Sun (God's Sun)
leaves the Age of Pisces (Jesus)


333
0:28:16,944 --> 0:28:20,449
it will go into the House of
Aquarius, as Aquarius follows Pisces


334
0:28:20,449 --> 0:28:22,413
in the precession
of the equinoxes.


335
0:28:22,413 --> 0:28:25,76
All Jesus is saying is that
after the Age of Pisces


336
0:28:25,76 --> 0:28:32,687
will come the Age of Aquarius.


337
0:28:32,687 --> 0:28:37,742
We have all heard about the "End
Times" and the end of the world.


338
0:28:37,742 --> 0:28:41,36
The cartoonish depictions in
the Book of Revelation aside


339
0:28:41,36 --> 0:28:45,124
the main source of this idea
comes from Matthew 28:20


340
0:28:45,124 --> 0:28:49,942
where Jesus says "I will be with
you even to the end of the world."


341
0:28:49,942 --> 0:28:54,9
However, in the King James Version,
'world' is a mistranslation


342
0:28:54,9 --> 0:28:56,757
among many mistranslations.


343
0:28:56,757 --> 0:29:2,227
The actual word being used is
'aeon', which means 'age'.


344
0:29:2,227 --> 0:29:5,49
"I will be with you even
to the end of the age."


345
0:29:5,49 --> 0:29:10,116
which is true, as Jesus' Solar
Piscean personification will end


346
0:29:10,116 --> 0:29:12,898
when the Sun enters
the Age of Aquarius.


347
0:29:12,898 --> 0:29:15,999
The entire concept of End Times
and the end of the world


348
0:29:15,999 --> 0:29:19,451
is a misinterpreted
astrological allegory.


349
0:29:19,451 --> 0:29:24,125
Let's tell that to the approximately
100 million people in America


350
0:29:24,125 --> 0:29:27,919
who believe the end of
the world is coming.


351
0:29:27,919 --> 0:29:30,858
Furthermore, the character
of Jesus being a literary


352
0:29:30,858 --> 0:29:35,412
and astrological hybrid is most
explicitly a plagiarization


353
0:29:35,412 --> 0:29:38,268
of the Egyptian Sun-god Horus.


354
0:29:38,268 --> 0:29:42,164
For example, inscribed
about 3500 years ago


355
0:29:42,164 --> 0:29:45,281
on the walls of the
Temple of Luxor in Egypt


356
0:29:45,281 --> 0:29:47,894
are images of the enunciation


357
0:29:47,894 --> 0:29:50,671
the miracle
conception, the birth


358
0:29:50,671 --> 0:29:53,64
and the adoration of Horus.


359
0:29:53,64 --> 0:29:56,662
The images begin with Thoth
announcing to the Virgin Isis


360
0:29:56,662 --> 0:29:58,614
that she will conceive Horus


361
0:29:58,614 --> 0:30:2,619
then Kneph, the holy ghost,
impregnating the virgin


362
0:30:2,619 --> 0:30:6,55
and then the virgin birth
and the adoration.


363
0:30:6,55 --> 0:30:11,441
This is exactly the story of
Jesus' miracle conception.


364
0:30:11,441 --> 0:30:15,255
The literary similarities
between the Egyptian religion


365
0:30:15,255 --> 0:30:28,88
and the Christian
religion are staggering.


366
0:30:28,88 --> 0:30:31,245
And the plagiarism
is continuous.


367
0:30:31,245 --> 0:30:35,632
The story of Noah and Noah's Arc
is taken directly from tradition.


368
0:30:35,632 --> 0:30:39,123
The concept of The Great Flood is
ubiquitous throughout the ancient world


369
0:30:39,123 --> 0:30:42,755
with over 200 different cited claims
in different periods and times.


370
0:30:42,755 --> 0:30:46,407
However, one need look no further
for a pre-Christian source


371
0:30:46,407 --> 0:30:51,323
than the Epic of Gilgamesh,
written in 2600 BC.


372
0:30:51,323 --> 0:30:55,302
This story talks of a great
flood commanded by God


373
0:30:55,302 --> 0:30:58,802
an ark with saved animals
upon it and even the release


374
0:30:58,802 --> 0:31:3,551
and return of a dove, all held in
common with the Biblical story


375
0:31:3,551 --> 0:31:8,213
among many other similarities.


376
0:31:8,213 --> 0:31:11,22
And then there is the
plagiarized story of Moses.


377
0:31:11,22 --> 0:31:14,803
Upon Moses' birth, it is said that
he was placed in a reed basket


378
0:31:14,803 --> 0:31:19,256
and set adrift in a river in
order to avoid infanticide.


379
0:31:19,256 --> 0:31:24,257
He was later rescued by a daughter of
royalty and raised by her as a Prince.


380
0:31:24,257 --> 0:31:27,561
This baby in a basket
story was lifted directly


381
0:31:27,561 --> 0:31:32,894
from the myth of Sargon of
Akkad of around 2250 BC.


382
0:31:32,894 --> 0:31:37,384
Sargon was born, placed in a reed
basket in order to avoid infanticide


383
0:31:37,384 --> 0:31:39,731
and set adrift in a river.


384
0:31:39,731 --> 0:31:44,361
He was in turn rescued and raised
by Akki, a royal mid-wife.


385
0:31:44,361 --> 0:31:47,134
Furthermore, Moses is
known as the Law Giver


386
0:31:47,134 --> 0:31:49,959
the giver of the Ten
Commandments, the Mosaic Law.


387
0:31:49,959 --> 0:31:53,551
However, the idea of a Law being
passed from God to a prophet


388
0:31:53,551 --> 0:31:57,61
up on a mountain is
also a very old motif.


389
0:31:57,61 --> 0:32:0,87
Moses is just another law giver
in a long line of law givers


390
0:32:0,87 --> 0:32:1,963
in mythological history.


391
0:32:1,963 --> 0:32:4,641
In India, Manou was
the great law giver.


392
0:32:4,641 --> 0:32:7,48
In Crete, Minos
ascended Mount Dicta


393
0:32:7,48 --> 0:32:9,219
where Zeus gave him
the sacred laws.


394
0:32:9,219 --> 0:32:12,469
While in Egypt there was Mises,
who carried stone tablets


395
0:32:12,469 --> 0:32:16,151
and upon them the laws
of God were written.


396
0:32:16,151 --> 0:32:21,331
Manou. Minos. Mises. Moses.


397
0:32:21,331 --> 0:32:24,227
And as far as the Ten Commandments,
they are taken outright


398
0:32:24,227 --> 0:32:27,352
from Spell 125 in the
Egyptian Book of the Dead.


399
0:32:27,352 --> 0:32:31,8
What the Book of the Dead phrased "I have
not stolen" became "Thou shall not steal".


400
0:32:31,8 --> 0:32:34,71
"I have not killed" became
"Thou shall not kill".


401
0:32:34,71 --> 0:32:38,351
"I have not told lies" became "Thou
shall not bear false witness"


402
0:32:38,351 --> 0:32:40,45
and so forth.


403
0:32:40,45 --> 0:32:44,84
In fact, the Egyptian religion is
likely the primary foundational basis


404
0:32:44,84 --> 0:32:47,296
for the Judeo-Christian
theology.


405
0:32:47,296 --> 0:32:51,654
Baptism, afterlife, final
judgment, virgin birth


406
0:32:51,654 --> 0:32:55,231
death and resurrection, crucifixion,
the Ark of the Covenant


407
0:32:55,231 --> 0:32:58,626
circumcision, saviors,
Holy Communion


408
0:32:58,626 --> 0:33:2,415
Great Flood, Easter,
Christmas, Passover


409
0:33:2,415 --> 0:33:6,733
and many more, are all
attributes of Egyptian ideas


410
0:33:6,733 --> 0:33:9,726
long pre-dating
Christianity and Judaism.


411
0:33:9,726 --> 0:33:16,1
Justin Martyr, one of the first Christian
historians and defenders, wrote:


412
0:33:16,1 --> 0:33:19,176
"When we say that he,
Jesus Christ, our teacher


413
0:33:19,176 --> 0:33:22,432
was produced without sexual
union, was crucified and died


414
0:33:22,432 --> 0:33:25,205
and rose again, and
ascended into Heaven


415
0:33:25,205 --> 0:33:28,383
we propound nothing different
from what you believe


416
0:33:28,383 --> 0:33:32,431
regarding those who you
esteem Sons of Jupiter."


417
0:33:32,431 --> 0:33:34,912
In a different writing,
Justin Martyr said:


418
0:33:34,912 --> 0:33:37,695
"He was born of a virgin,
accept this in common


419
0:33:37,695 --> 0:33:40,895
with what you believe
of Perseus."


420
0:33:40,895 --> 0:33:43,393
It's obvious that Justin
and other early Christians


421
0:33:43,393 --> 0:33:47,395
knew how similar Christianity
was to the pagan religions.


422
0:33:47,395 --> 0:33:50,241
However, Justin had a solution.


423
0:33:50,241 --> 0:33:54,367
As far as he was concerned,
the Devil did it.


424
0:33:54,367 --> 0:33:57,258
The Devil had the foresight
to come before Christ


425
0:33:57,258 --> 0:34:3,83
and create his characteristics
in the pagan world.


426
0:34:3,83 --> 0:34:6,192
(B. Hicks)
Fundamentalist
Christianity, fascinating!


427
0:34:6,192 --> 0:34:13,648
These people actually believe
the world is 12,000 years old.


428
0:34:13,648 --> 0:34:17,805
I actually asked one of these
guys "OK, dinosaur fossils?"


429
0:34:17,805 --> 0:34:20,633
He says "Dinosaur fossils?


430
0:34:20,633 --> 0:34:24,16
God put those here
to test our faith!"


431
0:34:24,16 --> 0:34:29,171
[Laughter]


432
0:34:29,171 --> 0:34:37,16
"I think God put you here
to test my faith, dude!"


433
0:34:37,16 --> 0:34:40,918
(P. Joseph)
The Bible is nothing more than
an astro-theological literary hybrid,


434
0:34:40,918 --> 0:34:44,47
just like nearly all
religious myths before it.


435
0:34:44,47 --> 0:34:48,37
In fact, the aspect of transference
of one character's attributes


436
0:34:48,37 --> 0:34:51,499
to a new character can be
found within the book itself.


437
0:34:51,499 --> 0:34:54,504
In the Old Testament there's
the story of Joseph.


438
0:34:54,504 --> 0:34:58,168
Joseph was a
prototype for Jesus.


439
0:34:58,168 --> 0:35:2,614
Joseph was born of a miracle birth.
Jesus was born of a miracle birth.


440
0:35:2,614 --> 0:35:6,512
Joseph was of 12 brothers.
Jesus had 12 disciples.


441
0:35:6,512 --> 0:35:8,599
Joseph was sold for
20 pieces of silver.


442
0:35:8,599 --> 0:35:10,796
Jesus was sold for
30 pieces of silver.


443
0:35:10,796 --> 0:35:14,296
Brother Judah suggests
the sale of Joseph.


444
0:35:14,296 --> 0:35:18,569
Disciple Judas suggests
the sale of Jesus.


445
0:35:18,569 --> 0:35:20,919
Joseph began his work
at the age of 30.


446
0:35:20,919 --> 0:35:23,136
Jesus began his work
at the age of 30.


447
0:35:23,136 --> 0:35:25,897
The parallels go on and on.


448
0:35:25,897 --> 0:35:30,57
Furthermore, is there any non-Biblical
historical evidence of any person


449
0:35:30,57 --> 0:35:32,99
living with the name
Jesus, the Son of Mary


450
0:35:32,99 --> 0:35:36,484
who traveled about with 12
followers, healing people?


451
0:35:36,484 --> 0:35:40,76
There are numerous historians who
lived in and around the Mediterranean


452
0:35:40,76 --> 0:35:44,228
either during or soon after
the assumed life of Jesus.


453
0:35:44,228 --> 0:35:49,569
How many of these historians
document this figure? Not one.


454
0:35:49,569 --> 0:35:52,298
However, to be fair, that
doesn't mean defenders


455
0:35:52,298 --> 0:35:55,499
of the historical Jesus
haven't claimed the contrary.


456
0:35:55,499 --> 0:35:59,234
Four historians are typically
referenced to justify Jesus' existence.


457
0:35:59,234 --> 0:36:3,3
Pliny the younger, Suetonius and
Tacitus are the first three.


458
0:36:3,3 --> 0:36:6,82
Each one of their entries consists
of only a few sentences at best


459
0:36:6,82 --> 0:36:10,79
and only refer to 'Christus' or the
Christ, which in fact is not a name


460
0:36:10,79 --> 0:36:13,814
but a title.
It means 'The Anointed One'.


461
0:36:13,814 --> 0:36:16,931
The fourth source is
Josephus and this source


462
0:36:16,931 --> 0:36:20,589
has been proven to be a forgery
for hundreds of years.


463
0:36:20,589 --> 0:36:26,274
Sadly, it is still
cited as truth.


464
0:36:26,274 --> 0:36:28,902
You would think that a guy
who rose from the dead


465
0:36:28,902 --> 0:36:31,544
and ascended into Heaven
for all eyes to see


466
0:36:31,544 --> 0:36:34,468
and performed the wealth of
miracles acclaimed to him


467
0:36:34,468 --> 0:36:36,96
would have made it into
the historical record.


468
0:36:36,96 --> 0:36:39,675
It didn't because once
the evidence is weighed


469
0:36:39,675 --> 0:36:42,993
there are very high odds that
the figure known as Jesus


470
0:36:42,993 --> 0:36:45,355
did not even exist.


471
0:36:45,355 --> 0:36:49,94
"The Christian religion is a
parody on the worship of the sun


472
0:36:49,94 --> 0:36:52,419
in which they put a man called
Christ in the place of the sun


473
0:36:52,419 --> 0:36:55,71
pay him the adoration
originally paid to the sun."


474
0:36:55,71 --> 0:36:58,276
Thomas Paine (1737-1809)


475
0:36:58,276 --> 0:37:2,574
(J. Maxwell)
We don't want to be
unkind, but we want to be factual.


476
0:37:2,574 --> 0:37:5,697
We don't want to
cause hurt feelings


477
0:37:5,697 --> 0:37:8,21
but we want to be
academically correct


478
0:37:8,21 --> 0:37:11,38
in what we understand
and know to be true.


479
0:37:11,38 --> 0:37:16,281
Christianity just is
not based on truth.


480
0:37:16,281 --> 0:37:21,42
We find that Christianity was in
fact nothing more than a Roman story


481
0:37:21,42 --> 0:37:25,604
developed politically.


482
0:37:25,604 --> 0:37:28,952
(P. Joseph)
The reality is,
Jesus was the Solar Deity


483
0:37:28,952 --> 0:37:31,98
of the Gnostic Christian sect


484
0:37:31,98 --> 0:37:36,95
and like all other pagan gods,
he was a mythical figure.


485
0:37:36,95 --> 0:37:39,837
It was the political establishment
that sought to historize


486
0:37:39,837 --> 0:37:44,41
the Jesus figure for
social control.


487
0:37:44,41 --> 0:37:50,143
In 325 AD in Rome, Emperor Constantine
convened the Council of Nicea.


488
0:37:50,143 --> 0:37:52,708
It was during this meeting
that the politically motivated


489
0:37:52,708 --> 0:37:55,56
Christian Doctrines
were established


490
0:37:55,56 --> 0:38:0,834
and thus began a long history of
religious bloodshed and spiritual fraud.


491
0:38:0,834 --> 0:38:3,702
And for over the next
1000 years, the Vatican


492
0:38:3,702 --> 0:38:7,315
maintained a political
stranglehold on all of Europe


493
0:38:7,315 --> 0:38:10,74
leading to such joyous
periods as the Dark Ages


494
0:38:10,74 --> 0:38:19,49
along with enlightening events such
as the Crusades and the Inquisition.


495
0:38:19,49 --> 0:38:22,82
Christianity, along with all
other related theologies


496
0:38:22,82 --> 0:38:25,27
is a historical fraud.


497
0:38:25,27 --> 0:38:29,214
These religions now serve to detach
the species from the natural world


498
0:38:29,214 --> 0:38:31,332
and likewise, each other.


499
0:38:31,332 --> 0:38:34,237
They support blind
submission to authority.


500
0:38:34,237 --> 0:38:36,805
They reduce human
responsibility to the effect


501
0:38:36,805 --> 0:38:40,91
that 'God' controls everything
and in turn awful crimes


502
0:38:40,91 --> 0:38:44,808
can be justified in the
name of a divine pursuit.


503
0:38:44,808 --> 0:38:49,875
And most critically, it empowers
the political establishment


504
0:38:49,875 --> 0:38:55,468
who have been using the myth to
manipulate and control societies.


505
0:38:55,468 --> 0:38:59,15
The religious myth is one of the
most powerful devices ever created


506
0:38:59,15 --> 0:39:9,928
and serves as the psychological soil
upon which other myths can flourish.


507
0:39:9,928 --> 0:39:17,52
(D. Griffin)
A myth is an idea that,
while widely believed, is false.


508
0:39:17,52 --> 0:39:22,378
In a deeper sense, in
the religious sense


509
0:39:22,378 --> 0:39:28,702
a myth serves as an orienting and
mobilizing story for a people.


510
0:39:28,702 --> 0:39:34,677
The focus is not on the story's relation
to reality but on its function.


511
0:39:34,677 --> 0:39:38,984
A story cannot function, unless
it is believed to be true


512
0:39:38,984 --> 0:39:42,366
in the community or the nation.


513
0:39:42,366 --> 0:39:47,38
It is not a matter of debate if
some people have the bad taste


514
0:39:47,38 --> 0:39:50,873
to raise the question of the
truth of the sacred story.


515
0:39:50,873 --> 0:39:54,491
The keepers of the faith do not
enter into debate with them.


516
0:39:54,491 --> 0:39:57,741
They ignore them or denounce
them as blasphemers.


517
0:39:57,741 --> 0:40:1,543
It is wrong, blasphemous and
sinful for you to suggest, imply


518
0:40:1,543 --> 0:40:3,956
or help other people
come to the conclusion


519
0:40:3,956 --> 0:40:10,646
that the US government killed
3,000 of its own citizens.


520
0:40:10,646 --> 0:40:13,404
Part II:


521
0:40:13,404 --> 0:40:52,4
All the World's a Stage


522
0:40:52,4 --> 0:40:54,231
(Man on phone) 
As if a
demolition team set off...


523
0:40:54,231 --> 0:40:56,291
when you see demolitions
of these old buildings.


524
0:40:56,291 --> 0:40:58,682
(Series of 3 reporters)
It looks like
one of those scenes


525
0:40:58,682 --> 0:41:0,864
of an old building being
purposely blown up.


526
0:41:0,864 --> 0:41:3,704
Anybody who's ever watched a
building being demolished


527
0:41:3,704 --> 0:41:6,543
on purpose knows that if you're
going to do this you have to get


528
0:41:6,543 --> 0:41:9,974
at the under-infrastructure of
a building and bring it down.


529
0:41:9,974 --> 0:41:13,6
The way the structure is
collapsing, this was the result


530
0:41:13,6 --> 0:41:16,168
of something that was planned.
It's not accidental


531
0:41:16,168 --> 0:41:19,8
that the 1st tower just happened
to collapse and then the 2nd tower


532
0:41:19,8 --> 0:41:22,333
just happened to collapse
in exactly the same way.


533
0:41:22,333 --> 0:41:24,914
How they accomplished
this, we don't know.


534
0:41:24,914 --> 0:41:28,102
(Fireman Casaliggi) 
The building
collapsed to dust.


535
0:41:28,102 --> 0:41:32,101
You don't find a desk,
you don't find a chair


536
0:41:32,101 --> 0:41:35,49
you don't find a
telephone or a computer.


537
0:41:35,49 --> 0:41:37,773
The biggest piece of
a telephone I found


538
0:41:37,773 --> 0:41:41,44
was half of the keypad and
it was about this big.


539
0:41:41,44 --> 0:41:44,213
- What happened to the concrete?
- The concrete was pulverized.


540
0:41:44,213 --> 0:41:48,506
From river to river there was dust
powder, two or three inches thick.


541
0:41:48,506 --> 0:41:51,8
The concrete was
just pulverized!


542
0:41:51,8 --> 0:41:54,546
(Man on phone)
...reminiscent of those
pictures we've all seen too much


543
0:41:54,546 --> 0:41:57,775
on TV before when a building
was deliberately destroyed


544
0:41:57,775 --> 0:42:0,76
by well-placed dynamite
to knock it down.


545
0:42:0,76 --> 0:42:3,396
- It's as if they had detonators...
- Yes, detonators


546
0:42:3,396 --> 0:42:5,72
-...planned to take down the
building, boom, boom...


547
0:42:5,72 --> 0:42:7,48
I heard a 2nd explosion.


548
0:42:7,48 --> 0:42:9,56
There was a
heavy-duty explosion.


549
0:42:9,56 --> 0:42:12,56
There was a secondary explosion
and then a subsequent collapse.


550
0:42:12,56 --> 0:42:14,96
...explosion blew and then
it knocked everybody over.


551
0:42:14,96 --> 0:42:16,86
To me it sounded
like an explosion.


552
0:42:16,86 --> 0:42:19,162
It sounded like
gun-fire, bang-bang!


553
0:42:19,162 --> 0:42:21,6
And then all of a sudden
three big explosions.


554
0:42:21,6 --> 0:42:23,48
... and we heard big
explosion coming down.


555
0:42:23,48 --> 0:42:26,12
... and then the entire top
of the building just blew up.


556
0:42:26,12 --> 0:42:30,138
- We saw some kind of explosion.
- By the force of the explosions... - big explosion...


557
0:42:30,138 --> 0:42:34,16
It blew us back into the 8th floor.
- We got to the lobby, there was a big explosion.


558
0:42:34,16 --> 0:42:36,64
The lobby looked as if a
bomb had exploded there.


559
0:42:36,64 --> 0:42:39,16
(Series of 7 witnesses)
Huge explosion,
now raining debris...


560
0:42:39,16 --> 0:42:41,36
There's been a huge explosion!!!


561
0:42:41,36 --> 0:42:44,32
Huge explosion that we
all heard and felt.


562
0:42:44,32 --> 0:42:47,28
We just witnessed some kind
of follow up explosion...


563
0:42:47,28 --> 0:42:50,28
We heard a very loud (It blasted!
) explosion...


564
0:42:50,28 --> 0:42:53,423
Smoke and secondary
explosion in Tower One...


565
0:42:53,423 --> 0:42:57,391
That is another bomb going off.
He thinks that there were actually devices


566
0:42:57,391 --> 0:43:2,211
that were planted in the building...
planted in the building...


567
0:43:2,211 --> 0:43:5,47
The 9/11 Myth


568
0:43:5,47 --> 0:43:8,472
19 hijackers, directed by Osama bin
Laden, took over 4 commercial jets


569
0:43:8,472 --> 0:43:12,11
and, while evading the Air Defense System
(NORAD), hit 75% of their targets.


570
0:43:12,11 --> 0:43:15,101
In turn, World Trade
Towers 1, 2 & 7 collapsed


571
0:43:15,101 --> 0:43:18,788
due to structural failure through
fire in a 'pancake' fashion


572
0:43:18,788 --> 0:43:22,382
while the plane that hit the
Pentagon vaporized upon impact


573
0:43:22,382 --> 0:43:25,271
as did the plane that
crashed in Shanksville.


574
0:43:25,271 --> 0:43:29,813
The 911 Commission found that there were
no warnings for this act of terrorism


575
0:43:29,813 --> 0:43:33,547
while multiple government failures
prevented adequate defense.


576
0:43:33,547 --> 0:43:39,961
'no warnings'


577
0:43:39,961 --> 0:43:43,273
(C. Rice)
I don't think
anybody could have predicted


578
0:43:43,273 --> 0:43:45,5
that they would try to use
an airplane as a missile


579
0:43:45,5 --> 0:43:47,551
a hijacked airplane
as a missile.


580
0:43:47,551 --> 0:43:49,98
Nobody in our government at least, and
I don't think the prior government


581
0:43:49,98 --> 0:43:52,39
could have envisioned flying
airplanes into buildings.


582
0:43:52,39 --> 0:43:55,643
No specific threat involving
domestic operations


583
0:43:55,643 --> 0:43:59,946
involving what happened obviously,
the cities, airliners and so on.


584
0:43:59,946 --> 0:44:3,88
There were no warning
signs that I'm aware of.


585
0:44:3,88 --> 0:44:9,53
USAToday reports that in the 2 years
before the attacks on September 11th


586
0:44:9,53 --> 0:44:13,88
NORAD conducted exercises using
hijacked airliners as weapons.


587
0:44:13,88 --> 0:44:17,25
And one target was the
World Trade Center.


588
0:44:17,25 --> 0:44:22,1
Cover of FEMA response
manual, 1997.


589
0:44:22,1 --> 0:44:27,702
Operation "Mascal", Oct.
2000, simulated a plane crash into the Pentagon.


590
0:44:27,702 --> 0:44:31,231
(Journalist)
In confidential documents
from the Philippines obtained by CNN


591
0:44:31,231 --> 0:44:35,853
the plan was clear: He will board
any American commercial aircraft


592
0:44:35,853 --> 0:44:40,24
control its cockpit, and dive
it at the CIA headquarters.


593
0:44:40,24 --> 0:44:43,96
Other buildings targeted included the
Pentagon and World Trade Center.


594
0:44:43,96 --> 0:44:48,52
The Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) received 52 warnings


595
0:44:48,52 --> 0:44:51,878
about Al-Qaeda in the
six months before 9/11


596
0:44:51,878 --> 0:44:54,419
and did not
apparently heed them.


597
0:44:54,419 --> 0:44:56,881
(Journalist)
The Pentagon reportedly
does not want the public to hear


598
0:44:56,881 --> 0:44:59,734
next week's Senate
Testimony about the former


599
0:44:59,734 --> 0:45:3,176
secret intelligence unit,
known as 'Able Danger'


600
0:45:3,176 --> 0:45:7,104
And it identified Mohammed Atta
and three other 9/11 terrorists


601
0:45:7,104 --> 0:45:9,799
as members of an Al-Qaeda
cell in Brooklyn, New York


602
0:45:9,799 --> 0:45:12,4
more than a year
before the attacks.


603
0:45:12,4 --> 0:45:15,16
And we found two of the three cells
which conducted the 9/11 attacks.


604
0:45:15,16 --> 0:45:18,106
(Journalist)
Lt Colonel Anthony Shaffer,
the first member of 'Able Danger'


605
0:45:18,106 --> 0:45:22,76
to go public, has now been told in writing
by the Defense Intelligence Agency


606
0:45:22,76 --> 0:45:26,737
that it can't speak to members of Congress
or their staff without prior approval.


607
0:45:26,737 --> 0:45:29,486
This is an attempt to
prevent the American people


608
0:45:29,486 --> 0:45:33,127
from knowing the facts about how
we could have prevented 9/11


609
0:45:33,127 --> 0:45:36,606
and people are
covering it up today.


610
0:45:36,606 --> 0:45:40,48
(Journalist)
Security and
counter-terrorism was blinking red


611
0:45:40,48 --> 0:45:44,1
in the words of George Tenet, that
the warnings of an imminent attack


612
0:45:44,1 --> 0:45:47,629
were so severe that something
dramatic should have been done.


613
0:45:47,629 --> 0:45:56,158
It was unparalleled. Instead, our
president went on a month-long vacation.


614
0:45:56,158 --> 0:46:0,827
19 Hijackers


615
0:46:0,827 --> 0:46:5,594
(M. Meacher) 
The head of Pakistani
intelligence (ISI) Mahmood Ahmed


616
0:46:5,594 --> 0:46:8,964
requested Omar Sheikh to wire


617
0:46:8,964 --> 0:46:13,244
$100,000 to Mohammed Atta
who was the lead hijacker.


618
0:46:13,244 --> 0:46:17,895
(2 journalists)
Hijacker Mohammed Atta
received wire transfers via Pakistan.


619
0:46:17,895 --> 0:46:20,155
The man sending
the money to Atta


620
0:46:20,155 --> 0:46:23,121
is believed to be Ahmed
Omar Saeed Sheikh.


621
0:46:23,121 --> 0:46:25,569
Omar Sheikh admitted
he was supported


622
0:46:25,569 --> 0:46:29,8
by the Pakistani Government's
intelligence service, the ISI.


623
0:46:29,8 --> 0:46:33,93
No inquiry was ever made as to why
General Ahmad ordered $100,000


624
0:46:33,93 --> 0:46:35,746
to be sent to Mohamed Atta.


625
0:46:35,746 --> 0:46:39,814
On the morning of September 11, government
officials were having breakfast


626
0:46:39,814 --> 0:46:42,133
with General Ahmad
in Washington.


627
0:46:42,133 --> 0:46:45,206
The 911 Commission deemed the
financing of the attacks


628
0:46:45,206 --> 0:46:48,564
was 'of little practical significance'
in their official report.


629
0:46:48,564 --> 0:46:52,25
(Journalist)
As hard as this is to believe,
that two of the alleged terrorists


630
0:46:52,25 --> 0:46:54,258
involved in what
happened on Tuesday


631
0:46:54,258 --> 0:46:57,896
may have attended schools run by U.
S. military.


632
0:46:57,896 --> 0:47:0,25
Evidence was also
apparently planted.


633
0:47:0,25 --> 0:47:2,327
The passport of one
of the hijackers


634
0:47:2,327 --> 0:47:5,79
on Flight 11 was allegedly
found in the rubble.


635
0:47:5,79 --> 0:47:7,326
The hijacker's passport
was found blocks


636
0:47:7,326 --> 0:47:10,23
from the World Trade Center crash
site, if you can believe that.


637
0:47:10,23 --> 0:47:12,645
The 9/11 hijackers
are alive and well


638
0:47:12,645 --> 0:47:15,493
that's according to the chief
of Japan's Democratic Party


639
0:47:15,493 --> 0:47:18,277
who says 9/11 is a hoax.


640
0:47:18,277 --> 0:47:21,41
Several of these 19
men are still alive.


641
0:47:21,41 --> 0:47:24,256
"I couldn't believe it when
the FBI put me on their list.


642
0:47:24,256 --> 0:47:27,287
They gave my name and my date of
birth but I'm not a suicide bomber.


643
0:47:27,287 --> 0:47:30,318
I am alive.
I have no idea how to fly a plane."


644
0:47:30,318 --> 0:47:34,272
At least 7 of the hijackers
are still alive.


645
0:47:34,272 --> 0:47:38,773
The FBI has to this day
not revised their list.


646
0:47:38,773 --> 0:47:47,801
At least 5 hijackers are reported as
linked to US Military Institutions.


647
0:47:47,801 --> 0:47:53,543
Osama B. Laden


648
0:47:53,543 --> 0:47:57,48
Of course we're after Saddam
Hussein, I mean bin Laden, he's...


649
0:47:57,48 --> 0:48:0,478
(Journalist)
In the early 80s bin
Laden worked with operatives


650
0:48:0,478 --> 0:48:5,231
from US Intelligence, the Pakistani
military and Arab states.


651
0:48:5,231 --> 0:48:10,543
January 2001.
The Bush Administration orders the FBI


652
0:48:10,543 --> 0:48:14,285
and intelligence agencies
to back off investigations


653
0:48:14,285 --> 0:48:16,541
involving the bin Laden family


654
0:48:16,541 --> 0:48:19,598
including two of Osama
bin Laden's relatives


655
0:48:19,598 --> 0:48:22,991
who were living, guess where?
In Falls Church, Virginia


656
0:48:22,991 --> 0:48:25,199
right next to CIA headquarters.


657
0:48:25,199 --> 0:48:28,307
When he was already America's
'most wanted criminal'


658
0:48:28,307 --> 0:48:32,339
he reportedly spent two weeks in
the American hospital in Dubai


659
0:48:32,339 --> 0:48:36,91
was treated by an American doctor
and visited by the local CIA agent.


660
0:48:36,91 --> 0:48:41,52
We have not seen one piece of
evidence that links Osama bin Laden


661
0:48:41,52 --> 0:48:44,358
directly to the planning
stages of September 11th.


662
0:48:44,358 --> 0:48:47,524
(D. Griffin)
This failure to provide
proof was later said to be unnecessary


663
0:48:47,524 --> 0:48:51,403
because bin Laden, in a video
allegedly found in Afghanistan


664
0:48:51,403 --> 0:48:54,72
admitted responsibility
for the attacks.


665
0:48:54,72 --> 0:48:56,92
"I have carefully examined
the Pentagon's translation


666
0:48:56,92 --> 0:48:59,15
which is very problematic.
At the most important pieces where it is held


667
0:48:59,15 --> 0:49:1,482
to prove the guilt of bin Laden, it
is not identical with the Arabic."


668
0:49:1,482 --> 0:49:3,6
Arabist Dr. Abdel EIM Husseini


669
0:49:3,6 --> 0:49:5,713
"The American translators who listened
to the tapes and transcribed them


670
0:49:5,713 --> 0:49:8,332
apparently wrote a lot of things
in that they wanted to hear


671
0:49:8,332 --> 0:49:11,374
but cannot be heard, no matter how
many times you listen to the tapes."


672
0:49:11,374 --> 0:49:14,1
Gernot Rotter, Prof.
of Islamic Studies at University of Hamburg


673
0:49:14,1 --> 0:49:19,521
In 1976, Osama's older
brother Saleem bin Laden


674
0:49:19,521 --> 0:49:22,439
hired a man in Texas by
the name of Jim Bath


675
0:49:22,439 --> 0:49:26,468
to handle all the investments in the
United States for the bin Laden family.


676
0:49:26,468 --> 0:49:29,915
Jim Bath also happens to be a
personal, almost life-long friend


677
0:49:29,915 --> 0:49:33,4
and former international guard
pilot, with George W. Bush.


678
0:49:33,4 --> 0:49:36,429
The connections between the
Bushes and the bin Ladens


679
0:49:36,429 --> 0:49:39,607
become much more clear when
George Herbert Walker Bush


680
0:49:39,607 --> 0:49:44,571
made trips to Saudi Arabia in
1998 and 2000 to meet with


681
0:49:44,571 --> 0:49:50,53
the bin Laden family on behalf of a
company called the Carlyle Group.


682
0:49:50,53 --> 0:49:53,554
On the morning of 9/11, the Carlyle
Group was having a conference


683
0:49:53,554 --> 0:49:57,165
in Washington, which included Osama's
older brother, Shafig bin Laden.


684
0:49:57,165 --> 0:50:0,345
The Carlyle Group is linked to the
world's largest defense contractors


685
0:50:0,345 --> 0:50:3,92
which continue to reap massive profits
off of the post 9/11 'War on Terrorism'


686
0:50:3,92 --> 0:50:9,7
and Afghan/Iraq Wars.


687
0:50:9,7 --> 0:50:13,436
Pentagon


688
0:50:13,436 --> 0:50:17,92
(Reporter)
How could anyone
fly a 60 ton, 125 foot wide


689
0:50:17,92 --> 0:50:21,12
44 foot tall plane through
this obstacle course?


690
0:50:21,12 --> 0:50:24,469
(D. Griffin)
The aircraft before striking
the Pentagon reportedly executed


691
0:50:24,469 --> 0:50:28,703
a 270 degree downward spiral


692
0:50:28,703 --> 0:50:32,347
and yet Hani Hanjour was
known as a terrible pilot


693
0:50:32,347 --> 0:50:35,528
who could not safely fly
even a small plane.


694
0:50:35,528 --> 0:50:38,793
"He didn't care about the fact that
he couldn't get through the course."


695
0:50:38,793 --> 0:50:42,196
"I am still to this day amazed that he
could have flown into the Pentagon... "


696
0:50:42,196 --> 0:50:46,81
- AZ Flight school employee (New
York Times Report 5/4/2002)


697
0:50:46,81 --> 0:50:49,56
(Reporter) No seats,
no luggage, no bodies.


698
0:50:49,56 --> 0:50:51,68
Nothing but bricks
and limestone.


699
0:50:51,68 --> 0:50:54,662
(D. Avery)
The official explanation is
that the intense heat from the jet fuel


700
0:50:54,662 --> 0:50:58,632
vaporized the entire plane.
Flight 77 had two Rolls Royce engines


701
0:50:58,632 --> 0:51:2,463
made of steel and titanium
alloy and weighed 6 tons each.


702
0:51:2,463 --> 0:51:5,7
It is scientifically impossible
that 12 tons of steel


703
0:51:5,7 --> 0:51:8,16
and titanium was
vaporized by jet fuel.


704
0:51:8,16 --> 0:51:12,982
We're also told that the bodies
were able to be identified


705
0:51:12,982 --> 0:51:16,51
either by the fingerprints
or by their DNA.


706
0:51:16,51 --> 0:51:20,64
So what kind of fire can vaporize
aluminum and tempered steel


707
0:51:20,64 --> 0:51:23,218
and yet leave human
bodies intact?


708
0:51:23,218 --> 0:51:27,154
(Reporter)
From my close-up inspection
there's no evidence of a plane


709
0:51:27,154 --> 0:51:29,222
having crashed anywhere
near the Pentagon


710
0:51:29,222 --> 0:51:32,546
and the only pieces
left that you can see


711
0:51:32,546 --> 0:51:35,4
are small enough that you
can pick up in your hand.


712
0:51:35,4 --> 0:51:37,161
(D. Griffin)
Shortly after the
strike, government agents


713
0:51:37,161 --> 0:51:39,711
picked up debris and
carried it off.


714
0:51:39,711 --> 0:51:43,11
The entire lawn was covered
with dirt and gravel


715
0:51:43,11 --> 0:51:47,253
so that any remaining forensic
evidence was literally covered up.


716
0:51:47,253 --> 0:51:50,27
The videos from security
cameras which would show


717
0:51:50,27 --> 0:51:53,414
what really hit the Pentagon
were immediately confiscated


718
0:51:53,414 --> 0:51:55,716
by agents of the FBI


719
0:51:55,716 --> 0:51:59,866
and the Department of Justice has to
this day refused to release them.


720
0:51:59,866 --> 0:52:4,721
If these videos would prove that the
Pentagon was really hit by a 757


721
0:52:4,721 --> 0:52:8,438
most of us would assume the
Government would release them.


722
0:52:8,438 --> 0:52:15,642
[Request Denied]


723
0:52:15,642 --> 0:52:20,402
Shanksville


724
0:52:20,402 --> 0:52:23,874
- It looks like there's nothing there
except for a hole in the ground.


725
0:52:23,874 --> 0:52:27,135
- Basically that's right, the only
thing you could see from where we were


726
0:52:27,135 --> 0:52:30,548
was a big gouge in the earth
and some broken trees.


727
0:52:30,548 --> 0:52:34,164
You could see some people working,
walking around in the area


728
0:52:34,164 --> 0:52:36,663
but from where we could see
there wasn't much left.


729
0:52:36,663 --> 0:52:39,761
- Any large pieces of debris at all?
- No, there was nothing.


730
0:52:39,761 --> 0:52:43,338
Nothing that you could distinguish
that a plane had crashed there.


731
0:52:43,338 --> 0:52:48,855
Commercial plane
crash in Nigeria


732
0:52:48,855 --> 0:52:56,493
Flight 93 "Crash" in Shanksville


733
0:52:56,493 --> 0:52:59,899
The FBI and state police here have
confirmed that they have cordoned off


734
0:52:59,899 --> 0:53:3,808
a second area about 6 to 8 miles
away from the crater here.


735
0:53:3,808 --> 0:53:7,63
This is apparently
another debris site.


736
0:53:7,63 --> 0:53:9,135
Why would debris be
located 6 miles away?


737
0:53:9,135 --> 0:53:18,137
Could that have blown that far away?
Seems highly unlikely.


738
0:53:18,137 --> 0:53:23,987
World Trade Towers 1, 2 & 7


739
0:53:23,987 --> 0:53:26,809
(D. Griffin)
Pancake theory,
according to which the fires


740
0:53:26,809 --> 0:53:29,659
while not melting the steel,
heated it up sufficiently


741
0:53:29,659 --> 0:53:32,305
to cause the floors weakened
by the airplane strikes


742
0:53:32,305 --> 0:53:36,14
to break loose from the steel columns
and this started a chain reaction.


743
0:53:36,14 --> 0:53:39,889
- So, you would expect then from that
theory, which is the official theory


744
0:53:39,889 --> 0:53:43,525
to see a whole stack of floors
piled up on top of each other


745
0:53:43,525 --> 0:53:46,45
and then a spindle of core
columns standing too.


746
0:53:46,45 --> 0:53:51,223
- The core of each of the Twin Towers
consisted of 47 massive steel columns.


747
0:53:51,223 --> 0:53:53,892
If the floors had broken loose
from them, these columns


748
0:53:53,892 --> 0:53:57,32
would have still been sticking up
into the air, a thousand feet.


749
0:53:57,32 --> 0:54:0,415
The plane did not cut
all those core columns.


750
0:54:0,415 --> 0:54:5,632
We designed the buildings to take
the impact of the Boeing 707


751
0:54:5,632 --> 0:54:7,92
hitting the building
at any location.


752
0:54:7,92 --> 0:54:13,411
The building probably could sustain
multiple impacts of jetliners.


753
0:54:13,411 --> 0:54:17,111
- ...that the plane flew straight into the building.
- Straight through, right.


754
0:54:17,111 --> 0:54:19,643
- So you're saying that the building
was actually designed to cope


755
0:54:19,643 --> 0:54:23,862
with a hole like that and then still survive?
- Yes, it was.


756
0:54:23,862 --> 0:54:26,784
- If you would drop,
say a billiard ball


757
0:54:26,784 --> 0:54:29,832
from the top of the World Trade
Center, 110 floors up there


758
0:54:29,832 --> 0:54:32,995
it would have taken 8 to 10
seconds to hit the ground


759
0:54:32,995 --> 0:54:35,28
encountering no
resistance whatsoever.


760
0:54:35,28 --> 0:54:38,178
(D. Avery)
The Twin Towers came
down in nearly free fall speed.


761
0:54:38,178 --> 0:54:42,987
200,000 tons of steel shatters and
explodes outwards over 500 feet.


762
0:54:42,987 --> 0:54:46,9
- This means that floors
shattered at an average rate


763
0:54:46,9 --> 0:54:48,449
of about ten floors per second.


764
0:54:48,449 --> 0:54:51,81
- There is no scenario for a pancake
effect of buildings falling


765
0:54:51,81 --> 0:54:54,22
that allows them to fall
at a rate of free fall.


766
0:54:54,22 --> 0:54:56,956
Now what can do that?
What can move mass out of the way?


767
0:54:56,956 --> 0:55:5,526
Explosives.


768
0:55:5,526 --> 0:55:10,632
47 huge steel columns going up the
core that are interconnected.


769
0:55:10,632 --> 0:55:14,895
How do you get them to fail
simultaneously so the core disappeared?


770
0:55:14,895 --> 0:55:17,95
It looks like those
core columns were cut.


771
0:55:17,95 --> 0:55:20,618
(Controlled demolition expert)
We do this by cutting the beam


772
0:55:20,618 --> 0:55:27,296
at an angle.


773
0:55:27,296 --> 0:55:32,866
World Trade Center core
column after the collapse.


774
0:55:32,866 --> 0:55:38,636
Notice the 'cut' shape and the melted...
or 'molten metal'.


775
0:55:38,636 --> 0:55:41,579
(S. Jones)
I started looking
at the molten metal.


776
0:55:41,579 --> 0:55:45,639
All three buildings, both towers in
the rubble, in the basement areas


777
0:55:45,639 --> 0:55:49,18
and Building 7, there were
these pools of molten metal.


778
0:55:49,18 --> 0:55:51,301
For well over 6 weeks
after the collapse


779
0:55:51,301 --> 0:55:53,978
hot spots of 2000Â°F were
documented in the debris.


780
0:55:53,978 --> 0:55:57,8
That is 500Â°F hotter
than jet fuel can burn


781
0:55:57,8 --> 0:55:59,868
in the most controlled
conditions.


782
0:55:59,868 --> 0:56:4,129
You'd get down below and
you'd see molten steel


783
0:56:4,129 --> 0:56:7,87
molten steel running
down the channel rails


784
0:56:7,87 --> 0:56:10,807
like you were in a foundry


785
0:56:10,807 --> 0:56:12,811
like lava of a volcano.


786
0:56:12,811 --> 0:56:16,359
(D. Avery)
The molten steel was
found 3, 4 and 5 weeks later


787
0:56:16,359 --> 0:56:18,404
when the rubble was
being removed.


788
0:56:18,404 --> 0:56:22,4
He said that molten steel was also
found underneath World Trade Center 7.


789
0:56:22,4 --> 0:56:25,58
So I'm looking through the official reports.
What do they say


790
0:56:25,58 --> 0:56:29,229
about the molten metal?
They say nothing.


791
0:56:29,229 --> 0:56:32,502
Wait a minute.
This is important evidence.


792
0:56:32,502 --> 0:56:36,647
Where did that come from?


793
0:56:36,647 --> 0:56:40,142
(S. Jones)
Thermite is so hot that
it will just cut through steel


794
0:56:40,142 --> 0:56:44,64
through structural steel, for example,
like a knife through butter.


795
0:56:44,64 --> 0:56:48,59
The products are molten
iron and aluminum oxide


796
0:56:48,59 --> 0:56:52,441
which goes off
primarily as a dust.


797
0:56:52,441 --> 0:56:54,736
You know, those
enormous dust clouds?


798
0:56:54,736 --> 0:57:2,136
You can imagine, when you assemble
these chemicals on a large scale.


799
0:57:2,136 --> 0:57:5,59
- So, professor Niels Harrit,
you examined the rubble


800
0:57:5,59 --> 0:57:9,281
that came from the World Trade Center.
What did you find in it?


801
0:57:9,281 --> 0:57:12,255
- In there, we find remains


802
0:57:12,255 --> 0:57:15,868
of what we characterize
as a thermitic material.


803
0:57:15,868 --> 0:57:18,55
This is very energetic material


804
0:57:18,55 --> 0:57:22,442
which can be used
either for melting iron


805
0:57:22,442 --> 0:57:26,162
or it can be designed
as an explosive.


806
0:57:26,162 --> 0:57:30,12
The evidence for controlled
demolition is overwhelming.


807
0:57:30,12 --> 0:57:33,791
I told you that the thermite
reaction produced molten iron.


808
0:57:33,791 --> 0:57:39,464
Molten iron was in pools of
molten iron in the rubble


809
0:57:39,464 --> 0:57:42,867
and the point is that the
thermite kept on reacting.


810
0:57:42,867 --> 0:57:45,834
This was the witches' brew
of thermite chemistry.


811
0:57:45,834 --> 0:57:50,1
Molten metal pools under both
towers after they collapsed


812
0:57:50,1 --> 0:57:54,42
and Building 7, which
wasn't even hit by a jet.


813
0:57:54,42 --> 0:57:56,574
(Reporter)
Part of the
problem is that most people


814
0:57:56,574 --> 0:57:58,93
simply don't know
much about Building 7


815
0:57:58,93 --> 0:58:2,183
due to the extraordinary secrecy
surrounding this collapse.


816
0:58:2,183 --> 0:58:5,44
(Reporter)
This was a
47-story skyscraper.


817
0:58:5,44 --> 0:58:9,102
This building fell at 5:25.


818
0:58:9,102 --> 0:58:11,186
(D. Griffin)
It was not hit
by a plane.


819
0:58:11,186 --> 0:58:14,357
This building had fires
on only 2 or 3 floors.


820
0:58:14,357 --> 0:58:18,702
- ... and it was brought down by what
we know was a controlled demolition.


821
0:58:18,702 --> 0:58:21,532
- Demolitions look just like
that, kink in the middle


822
0:58:21,532 --> 0:58:28,691
and then that building just comes
straight down almost at free fall speed.


823
0:58:28,691 --> 0:58:32,99
In 2005, The National Institute
of Standards and Technology


824
0:58:32,99 --> 0:58:34,622
released its report
on WTC Towers 1 & 2.


825
0:58:34,622 --> 0:58:38,786
The 10,000 page report does not
address the actual collapse.


826
0:58:38,786 --> 0:58:42,35
In 2008, The National Institute
of Standards and Technology


827
0:58:42,35 --> 0:58:44,541
released its report
on WTC Tower 7.


828
0:58:44,541 --> 0:58:46,951
They did not analyze
one piece of steel


829
0:58:46,951 --> 0:58:49,493
or test a controlled
demolition hypothesis.


830
0:58:49,493 --> 0:58:52,827
Rather, they built a computer
model with a predisposition


831
0:58:52,827 --> 0:58:55,358
that it was a
'fire-induced' collapse.


832
0:58:55,358 --> 0:58:59,49
The parameters used
have not been released.


833
0:58:59,49 --> 0:59:3,548
While admitting there was a period of
'free fall' for 2.25 sec (8 floors)


834
0:59:3,548 --> 0:59:6,574
they provide no explanation
as to how this is possible


835
0:59:6,574 --> 0:59:9,612
since their 'progressive
collapse' theory is based


836
0:59:9,612 --> 0:59:14,139
on systemic collisions
and triggered failures.


837
0:59:14,139 --> 0:59:17,221
The Law of Conservation of
Momentum simply cannot allow


838
0:59:17,221 --> 0:59:20,781
for a 'progressive'
movement through resistance


839
0:59:20,781 --> 0:59:28,8
at the rate of 'free fall'.


840
0:59:28,8 --> 0:59:31,667
Did we review the
sub-basement explosions


841
0:59:31,667 --> 0:59:34,975
which occurred moments
before the first plane hit?


842
0:59:34,975 --> 0:59:39,959
Our office was on the B1 level.
As I was talking to a supervisor at 8.46


843
0:59:39,959 --> 0:59:42,951
and all of a sudden we hear
- BOOM!


844
0:59:42,951 --> 0:59:45,73
(William Rodriguez, 20
year employee of the WTC)


845
0:59:45,73 --> 0:59:48,847
An explosion so hard
that pushed us upwards.


846
0:59:48,847 --> 0:59:53,769
And it came from the basement, between
the B2 level and the B3 level.


847
0:59:53,769 --> 0:59:57,616
And when I went to verbalize, we hear
- BOOM!


848
0:59:57,616 --> 1:0:0,2
The impact of the
plane on the top.


849
1:0:0,2 --> 1:0:4,44
(Reporter)
It would appear as if there's
more smoke coming from the ground...


850
1:0:4,44 --> 1:0:8,24
I was down at the basement, came down,
all of a sudden the elevator blew up.


851
1:0:8,24 --> 1:0:11,274
And as we were coming out, we passed a lobby.
There was no lobby


852
1:0:11,274 --> 1:0:13,648
so I believe the bomb
hit the lobby first


853
1:0:13,648 --> 1:0:15,57
and couple of seconds,
then the first plane hit.


854
1:0:15,57 --> 1:0:20,89
As I'm walking by the main freight
car of the building in the corridor


855
1:0:20,89 --> 1:0:22,891
that's when I got blown.


856
1:0:22,891 --> 1:0:26,84
I mean, the impact of the
explosion threw me to the floor


857
1:0:26,84 --> 1:0:28,88
and that's when everything
started happening.


858
1:0:28,88 --> 1:0:31,332
All of a sudden a big
impact happened again


859
1:0:31,332 --> 1:0:34,609
and all the ceiling tiles and
light fixtures were falling down.


860
1:0:34,609 --> 1:0:38,983
You have to go clear across the
hall from 1 to 2 World Trade Center


861
1:0:38,983 --> 1:0:41,35
and then all of a sudden it
happened all over again.


862
1:0:41,35 --> 1:0:44,993
Something else hit us to the floor.
Right in the basement, you felt it.


863
1:0:44,993 --> 1:0:48,61
Walls were caving in,
everything that was going on...


864
1:0:48,61 --> 1:0:50,338
I know people that got
killed in the basement.


865
1:0:50,338 --> 1:0:53,182
I know people that got
broken legs in the basement.


866
1:0:53,182 --> 1:1:0,76
People got reconstructive surgery
because the walls hit them in the face.


867
1:1:0,76 --> 1:1:6,392
NORAD (North American
Aerospace Defense Command)


868
1:1:6,392 --> 1:1:9,97
According to standard operating
procedure, if an FAA flight control


869
1:1:9,97 --> 1:1:12,869
notices anything that
suggests a possible hijacking


870
1:1:12,869 --> 1:1:16,5
controllers are to contact their superior.
If the problem cannot be fixed


871
1:1:16,5 --> 1:1:18,674
within about a minute, the
superior should ask NORAD


872
1:1:18,674 --> 1:1:21,28
the North American Aerospace
Command to send up


873
1:1:21,28 --> 1:1:24,103
or scramble jet fighters to
find out what is going on.


874
1:1:24,103 --> 1:1:26,8
NORAD then issues
a scramble order


875
1:1:26,8 --> 1:1:28,937
to the nearest air force
base with fighters on alert.


876
1:1:28,937 --> 1:1:32,835
Although interceptions usually
occur within 10 or so minutes


877
1:1:32,835 --> 1:1:36,33
in this case 80 or so
minutes had elapsed


878
1:1:36,33 --> 1:1:38,268
before fighters
were even airborne.


879
1:1:38,268 --> 1:1:40,614
(Reporter)
It's a
mind-bending anomaly.


880
1:1:40,614 --> 1:1:45,56
Not a single US Air Force interceptor
turns a wheel until it's too late.


881
1:1:45,56 --> 1:1:47,432
There are no jets at all.


882
1:1:47,432 --> 1:1:51,645
What if they were so confused, and
had been so deliberately confused


883
1:1:51,645 --> 1:1:53,8
that they couldn't respond?


884
1:1:53,8 --> 1:1:58,364
The reason that they didn't know where to
go was because a number of conflicting


885
1:1:58,364 --> 1:2:2,437
and overlapping war game
exercises were taking place


886
1:2:2,437 --> 1:2:5,688
that involved the insertion
of false radar blips


887
1:2:5,688 --> 1:2:8,88
on the radar screens in the
north-east air defense sector.


888
1:2:8,88 --> 1:2:11,161
(FAA)
"Hi, Boston Center TMU,
we have a problem here.


889
1:2:11,161 --> 1:2:14,101
We have a hijacked aircraft
headed towards New York


890
1:2:14,101 --> 1:2:18,181
we need someone to scramble some F-16s
or something up there to help us out."


891
1:2:18,181 --> 1:2:21,76
(NORAD)
"Is this real
world or exercise?"


892
1:2:21,76 --> 1:2:24,428
There was another exercise,
"Vigilant Warrior"


893
1:2:24,428 --> 1:2:26,839
which was in fact according
to a NORAD source


894
1:2:26,839 --> 1:2:30,406
a live-fly hijack drill being
conducted at the same time.


895
1:2:30,406 --> 1:2:32,656
With only 8 available
fighter aircraft


896
1:2:32,656 --> 1:2:35,5
and they have to be
dispatched in pairs


897
1:2:35,5 --> 1:2:39,776
they were dealing with as many as 22
possible hijacks on the day of 9/11


898
1:2:39,776 --> 1:2:44,581
and they couldn't separate the war game
exercises from the actual hijacks.


899
1:2:44,581 --> 1:2:48,152
In 2000, NORAD had 67 intercepts.
100% accuracy.


900
1:2:48,152 --> 1:2:52,338
On 9/11 they failed
4 times in one day.


901
1:2:52,338 --> 1:2:56,233
In at least one of the many war
games going on the morning of 9/11


902
1:2:56,233 --> 1:3:4,702
planes being flown into
buildings was a scenario.


903
1:3:4,702 --> 1:3:9,62
9/11 Commission


904
1:3:9,62 --> 1:3:13,64
Page 172: "The US Government
has not been able to determine


905
1:3:13,64 --> 1:3:16,216
the origin of the money
used for the 9/11 attacks.


906
1:3:16,216 --> 1:3:19,32
Ultimately, the question is of
little practical significance."


907
1:3:19,32 --> 1:3:22,359
The American authorities
have not managed to trace


908
1:3:22,359 --> 1:3:26,128
the source of the funding
and then the most amazingly


909
1:3:26,128 --> 1:3:29,96
disingenuous statement: "Ultimately,
is it of little consequence".


910
1:3:29,96 --> 1:3:32,395
It is of massive consequence!


911
1:3:32,395 --> 1:3:34,404
Doesn't it matter
who paid for 9/11?


912
1:3:34,404 --> 1:3:37,301
(D. Griffin)
The collapse of
Building 7 has been recognized


913
1:3:37,301 --> 1:3:40,316
as especially
difficult to explain.


914
1:3:40,316 --> 1:3:44,562
The 9/11 Commission Report implicitly
admitted that it could not explain


915
1:3:44,562 --> 1:3:48,24
the collapse of this building
by not even mentioning it.


916
1:3:48,24 --> 1:3:50,896
- Mr. President, why are you and
the Vice President insisting on


917
1:3:50,896 --> 1:3:53,333
appearing together before
the 9/11 Commission?


918
1:3:53,333 --> 1:3:56,48
- Because the 9/11 Commission
wants to ask us questions.


919
1:3:56,48 --> 1:3:58,786
That's why we are meeting and I
look forward to meeting with them


920
1:3:58,786 --> 1:4:0,969
and answering their questions.


921
1:4:0,969 --> 1:4:4,28
- The question was, why are you appearing
together rather than separately


922
1:4:4,28 --> 1:4:6,547
which was their request?


923
1:4:6,547 --> 1:4:9,656
- Because it's a good chance for
both of us to answer questions


924
1:4:9,656 --> 1:4:13,761
that the 9/11 Commission is
looking forward to asking us


925
1:4:13,761 --> 1:4:17,11
and I am looking forward to
answering them. Let's see.


926
1:4:17,11 --> 1:4:20,802
- Do you think they should be able to
stand up and speak their own words?


927
1:4:20,802 --> 1:4:23,447
- They should go under oath.
In public!


928
1:4:23,447 --> 1:4:26,45
When Bush and Cheney met with the
9/11 Commission, they did so


929
1:4:26,45 --> 1:4:29,164
only on their own terms:
They appeared together.


930
1:4:29,164 --> 1:4:31,546
They were not under oath.


931
1:4:31,546 --> 1:4:33,996
No press or family members
were allowed to attend.


932
1:4:33,996 --> 1:4:36,794
No recording of any
kind was allowed.


933
1:4:36,794 --> 1:4:40,12
- Don't you think that the families
deserve to have a transcript


934
1:4:40,12 --> 1:4:43,12
or to be able to see...
- Adam, you asked me that question yesterday


935
1:4:43,12 --> 1:4:45,602
and got the same answer.


936
1:4:45,602 --> 1:4:48,371
- The final report was
a unanimous report.


937
1:4:48,371 --> 1:4:51,904
That means that if there was a single
commissioner who had any objection


938
1:4:51,904 --> 1:4:55,574
about anything, that fact would
be dropped from the report.


939
1:4:55,574 --> 1:4:59,518
- We have found out that he not
only served on the transition team


940
1:4:59,518 --> 1:5:1,78
of the Bush Administration


941
1:5:1,78 --> 1:5:4,383
that he was a person
who wrote a draft memo


942
1:5:4,383 --> 1:5:8,69
for the setup of the Bush Administration's
National Security Council


943
1:5:8,69 --> 1:5:11,22
that he was an individual who
wrote the preemptive war strategy


944
1:5:11,22 --> 1:5:13,322
that was eventually used
for the war on Iraq


945
1:5:13,322 --> 1:5:16,48
that he's a close friend
of Condoleezza Rice's.


946
1:5:16,48 --> 1:5:18,32
We want him to resign.


947
1:5:18,32 --> 1:5:21,167
There is literally nothing
in the 9/11 Report


948
1:5:21,167 --> 1:5:24,28
that the Bush Administration
did not approve of.


949
1:5:24,28 --> 1:5:26,939
(D. Griffin)
We can understand
therefore why the Commission


950
1:5:26,939 --> 1:5:30,818
under Zelikow's leadership would
have ignored all the evidence


951
1:5:30,818 --> 1:5:32,88
that would point to the truth


952
1:5:32,88 --> 1:5:35,536
that 9/11 was a false
flag operation


953
1:5:35,536 --> 1:5:38,622
intended to authorize
the doctrines and funds


954
1:5:38,622 --> 1:5:48,65
needed for a new level of
imperial mobilization.


955
1:5:48,65 --> 1:5:51,68
Terrorism


956
1:5:51,68 --> 1:5:54,202
Terrorism: 1) Systematic
use of terror


957
1:5:54,202 --> 1:5:59,72
manifesting itself in violence or
intimidation, for generating fear.


958
1:5:59,72 --> 1:6:3,249
Armed with knives. Armed with chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons.


959
1:6:3,249 --> 1:6:6,57
Fanatics. Terrorists. September 11th.
September 11th. Killers.


960
1:6:6,57 --> 1:6:8,4
September 11th. Terrorists.
Al Qaeda, Terrorists.


961
1:6:8,4 --> 1:6:11,8
Nuclear weapons. Terror.
9/11. Terror. Evil.


962
1:6:11,8 --> 1:6:15,659
September 11th. September 11th.
The terrorists. War and danger.


963
1:6:15,659 --> 1:6:19,28
September 11th. Terrorism.
Global terrorism. Terrorism. Terrorist


964
1:6:19,28 --> 1:6:22,72
Terrorist. (Repeated 5 times)


965
1:6:22,72 --> 1:6:26,16
Terrorists. Terrorism.
September 11th. Global terrorism.


966
1:6:26,16 --> 1:6:30,209
Terrorism. Terrorism. Terrorists.
September 11th. World terrorism.


967
1:6:30,209 --> 1:6:32,96
Terrorism. September 11th.
Global Terrorism.


968
1:6:32,96 --> 1:6:35,612
September the 11th. Terrorist.
Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist.


969
1:6:35,612 --> 1:6:38,16
Weapons of mass destruction.
September 11th.


970
1:6:38,16 --> 1:6:42,653
September the 11th. The evil terrorists.
Terrorists. Terrorists Know!


971
1:6:42,653 --> 1:6:45,96
(Journalist)
Terrorism.
The words are hypnotically repeated:


972
1:6:45,96 --> 1:6:48,999
Terrorism. Terrorists.
Terrorist threat.


973
1:6:48,999 --> 1:6:53,101
And of course, "believed
to be linked to al-Qaeda".


974
1:6:53,101 --> 1:6:56,386
But, it's the so-called
'War on Terrorism'


975
1:6:56,386 --> 1:6:59,254
that's in our faces
practically 24/7


976
1:6:59,254 --> 1:7:2,156
as the inescapable focus
of our existence.


977
1:7:2,156 --> 1:7:5,876
(D. Rumsfeld)
One day our grandchildren
will look back on this time and ask


978
1:7:5,876 --> 1:7:8,55
"How was the War on Terror won?"


979
1:7:8,55 --> 1:7:12,149
The entire US ruling
class, ruling elite


980
1:7:12,149 --> 1:7:15,402
comes to see terrorism
as the preferred means


981
1:7:15,402 --> 1:7:19,62
indeed the only means to
provide social cohesion


982
1:7:19,62 --> 1:7:22,431
to provide an enemy image for the
society, to keep it together.


983
1:7:22,431 --> 1:7:24,99
According to neocon theory from
Carl Schmitt, you have to have


984
1:7:24,99 --> 1:7:27,373
an enemy image in order
to have a society.


985
1:7:27,373 --> 1:7:30,795
A very dangerous thing because now it
means that the entire social order


986
1:7:30,795 --> 1:7:34,37
the political parties, intellectual
life, politics in general


987
1:7:34,37 --> 1:7:36,96
are all based on a
monstrous myth.


988
1:7:36,96 --> 1:7:44,268
[Echoed: monstrous myth]


989
1:7:44,268 --> 1:7:47,525
Terrorism: 2) Technique
used by governments


990
1:7:47,525 --> 1:7:51,76
to manipulate public opinion
in order to further an agenda.


991
1:7:51,76 --> 1:7:54,499
Look, what the CIA has
done in this country


992
1:7:54,499 --> 1:7:56,922
what they have done to
us is unbelievable.


993
1:7:56,922 --> 1:7:59,323
Look at the terrorist
acts that have occurred.


994
1:7:59,323 --> 1:8:1,76
The CIA is behind most
if not all of them.


995
1:8:1,76 --> 1:8:5,781
We had the Marine barracks,
their embassy in Kenya.


996
1:8:5,781 --> 1:8:10,681
We had Pan Am 103.
We had the USS Cole.


997
1:8:10,681 --> 1:8:15,559
We had Oklahoma City.
We had the World Trade Center in 1993.


998
1:8:15,559 --> 1:8:20,284
...that helped the terrorists to blow up
the World Trade Center the first time.


999
1:8:20,284 --> 1:8:23,754
They built the bomb.
They got the driver's license.


1000
1:8:23,754 --> 1:8:29,414
The informer Emad A. Salem, a 43-year-old
former Egyptian Army officer


1001
1:8:29,414 --> 1:8:32,601
was given the assignment
to put the bomb together


1002
1:8:32,601 --> 1:8:35,24
and he went to his
FBI supervisor


1003
1:8:35,24 --> 1:8:37,665
and he said "We're going to put
a dummy bomb in here, right?"


1004
1:8:37,665 --> 1:8:40,6
and the FBI supervisor said "No,
we're going to put a real bomb."


1005
1:8:40,6 --> 1:8:43,741
(Journalist)
FBI agents might
have been able to prevent


1006
1:8:43,741 --> 1:8:47,704
last February's deadly explosion
at New York's World Trade Center.


1007
1:8:47,704 --> 1:8:51,719
They discussed secretly substituting
harmless powder for the explosives


1008
1:8:51,719 --> 1:8:56,326
but they didn't, according to the
FBI's own informant Emad Salem.


1009
1:8:56,326 --> 1:8:58,74
Unbeknownst to the
FBI at the time


1010
1:8:58,74 --> 1:9:2,322
Salem recorded many of his
conversations with his handlers.


1011
1:9:2,322 --> 1:9:6,426
Unfortunately for them, there
were only six people killed


1012
1:9:6,426 --> 1:9:8,52
not enough to pass
the legislation.


1013
1:9:8,52 --> 1:9:11,299
So, what happened
is two years later


1014
1:9:11,299 --> 1:9:15,436
April 19, 1995 down
comes Oklahoma City


1015
1:9:15,436 --> 1:9:18,694
the Murrah Building,
168 people killed.


1016
1:9:18,694 --> 1:9:21,92
One year later, the anti-terror
legislation, which takes away


1017
1:9:21,92 --> 1:9:25,845
many of our constitutional rights
and civil liberties, is passed.


1018
1:9:25,845 --> 1:9:38,1
Madrid, 2004


1019
1:9:38,1 --> 1:9:45,268
7/7/2005 London: 3 trains and a bus
were bombed, killing 56 people.


1020
1:9:45,268 --> 1:9:47,93
That morning, an "anti-terror
exercise" just happened


1021
1:9:47,93 --> 1:9:50,129
to be taking place as
well, dealing with...


1022
1:9:50,129 --> 1:9:52,342
THE EXACT SAME BOMBING SCENARIO


1023
1:9:52,342 --> 1:9:54,46
AT THE EXACT SAME TRAIN STATIONS


1024
1:9:54,46 --> 1:9:56,751
AT THE EXACT SAME TIME.


1025
1:9:56,751 --> 1:10:0,296
- ... because at half past 9 this morning,
we were actually running an exercise


1026
1:10:0,296 --> 1:10:4,69
for a company of over a thousand people
in London based on simultaneous bombs


1027
1:10:4,69 --> 1:10:7,189
going off precisely at the railway
stations where it happened this morning


1028
1:10:7,189 --> 1:10:9,723
so I still have the hairs on the
back of my neck standing upright!


1029
1:10:9,723 --> 1:10:14,9
- To get this straight, you were running
an exercise to see how you would cope


1030
1:10:14,9 --> 1:10:17,634
with this and it happened while you
were running the exercise? - Precisely!


1031
1:10:17,634 --> 1:10:21,439
Yeah... That's right. The exact same
bombing at the exact same train stations


1032
1:10:21,439 --> 1:10:23,624
at virtually the same time.


1033
1:10:23,624 --> 1:10:26,802
[We're] supposed to believe it
was some kind of coincidence


1034
1:10:26,802 --> 1:10:30,401
that there was also an anti-terrorist
drill going on on 7/7.


1035
1:10:30,401 --> 1:10:32,85
And again, just like on 9/11


1036
1:10:32,85 --> 1:10:35,423
they were talking about
attacks on the same targets


1037
1:10:35,423 --> 1:10:38,906
the same kind of tube stations
at exactly the same time


1038
1:10:38,906 --> 1:10:41,169
as the actual attack happened


1039
1:10:41,169 --> 1:10:44,704
providing some kind of
cover for what must be


1040
1:10:44,704 --> 1:11:1,17
operations orchestrated
in some way by the State.


1041
1:11:1,17 --> 1:11:3,574
(J. Maxwell)
I am
absolutely appalled


1042
1:11:3,574 --> 1:11:7,397
at how much people in this
country do not think.


1043
1:11:7,397 --> 1:11:10,183
We are given to understand


1044
1:11:10,183 --> 1:11:13,874
that a guy out there
up in the mountains


1045
1:11:13,874 --> 1:11:17,483
financed the most elaborate
attack on this country.


1046
1:11:17,483 --> 1:11:21,716
(A. Jones)
Do you think
some people in a cave


1047
1:11:21,716 --> 1:11:24,221
were able to have
NORAD stand down?


1048
1:11:24,221 --> 1:11:26,616
Do you think that
people in a cave


1049
1:11:26,616 --> 1:11:28,987
were able to have
all of this happen?


1050
1:11:28,987 --> 1:11:31,419
(J. Maxwell)
And when I think
about how many Americans


1051
1:11:31,419 --> 1:11:34,419
were killed in New York City


1052
1:11:34,419 --> 1:11:38,84
and believing as I do that
this thing was a set-up job


1053
1:11:38,84 --> 1:11:42,241
this is a textbook
operation that Nazis used


1054
1:11:42,241 --> 1:11:45,538
and they've used it
over and over again.


1055
1:11:45,538 --> 1:11:52,558
America has been suckered
in one more time.


1056
1:11:52,558 --> 1:11:55,44
("Network" 1976)
I don't have
to tell you things are bad.


1057
1:11:55,44 --> 1:11:57,9
Everybody knows things are bad.


1058
1:11:57,9 --> 1:12:0,112
The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
Banks are going bust.


1059
1:12:0,112 --> 1:12:2,713
Shopkeepers keep a gun
under the counter.


1060
1:12:2,713 --> 1:12:5,114
Punks are running wild in the street.
There's nobody anywhere


1061
1:12:5,114 --> 1:12:8,526
who seems to know what to do
and there's no end to it.


1062
1:12:8,526 --> 1:12:13,417
We know the air is unfit to breathe
and our food is unfit to eat.


1063
1:12:13,417 --> 1:12:16,595
We sit watching our TVs while
some local newscaster tells us


1064
1:12:16,595 --> 1:12:20,272
that today we had 15 homicides
and 63 violent crimes


1065
1:12:20,272 --> 1:12:23,316
as if that's the way it's supposed to be!
We know things are bad.


1066
1:12:23,316 --> 1:12:25,694
Worse than bad, they're crazy!


1067
1:12:25,694 --> 1:12:29,137
It's like everything everywhere is going
crazy, so we don't go out anymore.


1068
1:12:29,137 --> 1:12:32,428
We sit in the house and slowly the world
we're living in is getting smaller


1069
1:12:32,428 --> 1:12:36,56
and all we say is "Please, at least
leave us alone in our living rooms.


1070
1:12:36,56 --> 1:12:39,588
Let me have my toaster and my
TV, my steel-belted radials


1071
1:12:39,588 --> 1:12:41,871
and I won't say anything.
Just leave us alone!"


1072
1:12:41,871 --> 1:12:46,22
Well I'm not going to leave you alone.
I want you to get mad!


1073
1:12:46,22 --> 1:12:48,311
I don't want you to protest,
I don't want you to riot.


1074
1:12:48,311 --> 1:12:50,49
I don't want you to write to your
Congressman because I wouldn't know


1075
1:12:50,49 --> 1:12:53,4
what to tell you to write.
I don't know what to do about the depression


1076
1:12:53,4 --> 1:12:56,217
and the inflation and the Russians
and the crime in the street.


1077
1:12:56,217 --> 1:12:59,298
All I know is that first
you've got to get mad!


1078
1:12:59,298 --> 1:13:2,41
You've got to say "I'm a
human being, goddamn it!


1079
1:13:2,41 --> 1:13:38,963
My life has value!"


1080
1:13:38,963 --> 1:13:45,155
(Man on phone)
There's smoke, real bad!
105, two tower.


1081
1:13:45,155 --> 1:13:48,585
It's real bad, it's
black, it's arid.


1082
1:13:48,585 --> 1:13:52,63
My wife thinks I'm all right.
I called and said I was leaving the building.


1083
1:13:52,63 --> 1:13:55,73
I was fine, and then BANG!


1084
1:13:55,73 --> 1:13:58,761
Three of us - two
broken windows.


1085
1:13:58,761 --> 1:14:28,64
Oh God!


1086
1:14:28,64 --> 1:14:32,599
(Charles Lindbergh, 1941)
When hostilities
commenced in Europe in 1939


1087
1:14:32,599 --> 1:14:38,3
it was realized that the American people
had no intention of entering the war.


1088
1:14:38,3 --> 1:14:41,89
But they believed that this country
could be enticed into the war


1089
1:14:41,89 --> 1:14:46,38
in very much the same way that it
was enticed into the last one.


1090
1:14:46,38 --> 1:14:51,891
They planned, first, to prepare
the United States for foreign war


1091
1:14:51,891 --> 1:14:55,401
under the guise of
American defense.


1092
1:14:55,401 --> 1:14:58,481
Second, to involve us in the war


1093
1:14:58,481 --> 1:15:2,4
step by step, without
our realization.


1094
1:15:2,4 --> 1:15:5,403
Third, to create a
series of incidents


1095
1:15:5,403 --> 1:15:8,654
which would force us into
the actual conflict.


1096
1:15:8,654 --> 1:15:12,821
These plans were, of course,
to be covered and assisted


1097
1:15:12,821 --> 1:15:17,4
by the full power of
their propaganda.


1098
1:15:17,4 --> 1:15:20,91
Our theaters soon became
filled with plays


1099
1:15:20,91 --> 1:15:22,717
portraying the glory of war.


1100
1:15:22,717 --> 1:15:26,803
News reels lost all
semblance of objectivity


1101
1:15:26,803 --> 1:15:28,937
and they have used the war


1102
1:15:28,937 --> 1:15:32,614
to justify the restriction
of congressional power


1103
1:15:32,614 --> 1:15:35,549
and the assumption of
dictatorial procedures


1104
1:15:35,549 --> 1:15:40,361
on the part of the President
and his appointees.


1105
1:15:40,361 --> 1:15:45,622
A fear campaign was inaugurated.


1106
1:15:45,622 --> 1:15:50,267
We cannot allow the natural
passions and prejudices


1107
1:15:50,267 --> 1:15:56,832
of other peoples, to lead
our country to destruction.


1108
1:15:56,832 --> 1:16:1,47
Part III:


1109
1:16:1,47 --> 1:16:8,192
Don't Mind The Men
Behind The Curtain


1110
1:16:8,192 --> 1:16:11,345
"Behind the ostensible government sits
enthroned an invisible government


1111
1:16:11,345 --> 1:16:14,0
owing no allegiance and
acknowledging no responsibility


1112
1:16:14,0 --> 1:16:16,323
to the people."
- Theodore Roosevelt


1113
1:16:16,323 --> 1:16:18,633
"The real menace of our republic
is the invisible government...


1114
1:16:18,633 --> 1:16:21,5
The little coterie of powerful international
bankers virtually runs the US government


1115
1:16:21,5 --> 1:16:23,638
for their own selfish purposes.
" John F. Hylan


1116
1:16:23,638 --> 1:16:26,898
"The real truth of the matter is that a
financial element in the large centers


1117
1:16:26,898 --> 1:16:29,94
has owned the government since the days of Andrew Jackson."
- Franklin D. Roosevelt


1118
1:16:29,94 --> 1:16:33,984
(P. Joseph)
1775, the American
Revolutionary War began


1119
1:16:33,984 --> 1:16:36,716
as the American colonies
sought to detach from England


1120
1:16:36,716 --> 1:16:38,83
and its oppressive monarchy.


1121
1:16:38,83 --> 1:16:41,44
Though many reasons are
cited for the revolution


1122
1:16:41,44 --> 1:16:44,428
one in particular sticks
out as a prime cause:


1123
1:16:44,428 --> 1:16:47,92
that King George llI
of England outlawed


1124
1:16:47,92 --> 1:16:49,827
the interest-free
independent currency


1125
1:16:49,827 --> 1:16:52,123
the colonies were
producing themselves


1126
1:16:52,123 --> 1:16:56,243
in turn forcing them to borrow money
from the Central Bank of England


1127
1:16:56,243 --> 1:16:59,595
immediately creating economic
hardship and despair.


1128
1:16:59,595 --> 1:17:2,111
In the words of Peter Cooper,
former vice-president


1129
1:17:2,111 --> 1:17:5,71
of the New York Board of Currency:
"After Franklin had explained


1130
1:17:5,71 --> 1:17:7,99
to the British government as
the real cause of prosperity


1131
1:17:7,99 --> 1:17:11,85
they immediately passed laws forbidding
the payment of taxes in that money.


1132
1:17:11,85 --> 1:17:14,927
This produced such great inconvenience
and misery to the people


1133
1:17:14,927 --> 1:17:17,617
that it was the principal
cause of the revolution."


1134
1:17:17,617 --> 1:17:21,297
In 1783, America won its
independence from England.


1135
1:17:21,297 --> 1:17:24,288
However, its battle against
the central bank concept


1136
1:17:24,288 --> 1:17:27,52
and the corrupt, power-hungry
mentality associated with it


1137
1:17:27,52 --> 1:17:29,606
had just begun.


1138
1:17:29,606 --> 1:17:33,228
So what is a central bank?
A central bank is an institution


1139
1:17:33,228 --> 1:17:36,967
that issues and regulates the
currency of an entire nation.


1140
1:17:36,967 --> 1:17:40,133
Based on historical precedent,
the typical powers inherent


1141
1:17:40,133 --> 1:17:44,285
in central banking practice include
the control of interest rates


1142
1:17:44,285 --> 1:17:47,928
and the expansion and contraction
of the money supply itself.


1143
1:17:47,928 --> 1:17:51,566
The Central Bank does not simply
issue money to the government.


1144
1:17:51,566 --> 1:17:54,6
It loans it to them
with interest.


1145
1:17:54,6 --> 1:17:58,264
Then, through the mechanisms of increasing
and decreasing the supply of money


1146
1:17:58,264 --> 1:18:2,874
the Central Bank essentially regulates
the value of the currency issued.


1147
1:18:2,874 --> 1:18:7,169
It is critical to understand that
the entire structure of this system


1148
1:18:7,169 --> 1:18:11,521
can only produce one thing
in the long run: debt.


1149
1:18:11,521 --> 1:18:14,721
It doesn't take a lot of ingenuity
to figure this scam out


1150
1:18:14,721 --> 1:18:18,248
for nearly every single dollar
produced by both the Central Bank


1151
1:18:18,248 --> 1:18:22,611
and its regulated commercial
banks is loaned at interest.


1152
1:18:22,611 --> 1:18:25,586
That means every dollar
produced is actually the dollar


1153
1:18:25,586 --> 1:18:30,34
plus a certain percentage of
debt based on that dollar.


1154
1:18:30,34 --> 1:18:33,25
And since the banking system has
the monopoly of the production


1155
1:18:33,25 --> 1:18:36,74
of the currency and they
loan each dollar out


1156
1:18:36,74 --> 1:18:38,887
with an immediate
debt attached to it


1157
1:18:38,887 --> 1:18:42,56
where does the money to pay
for the debt come from?


1158
1:18:42,56 --> 1:18:44,618
It can only come
from the banks again


1159
1:18:44,618 --> 1:18:47,806
which means the banking system
has to perpetually increase


1160
1:18:47,806 --> 1:18:52,376
its money supply to temporarily
cover the outstanding debt created


1161
1:18:52,376 --> 1:18:56,506
which in turn, since that new
money is loaned out at interest


1162
1:18:56,506 --> 1:18:58,93
creates even more debt!


1163
1:18:58,93 --> 1:19:2,233
The end result of this system
is essentially slavery


1164
1:19:2,233 --> 1:19:6,29
for it is technically impossible for
a government and thus the public


1165
1:19:6,29 --> 1:19:10,747
to ever come out of the
self-generating debt.


1166
1:19:10,747 --> 1:19:13,561
"And I sincerely believe...
that banking establishments are


1167
1:19:13,561 --> 1:19:16,65
more dangerous than
standing armies;


1168
1:19:16,65 --> 1:19:19,279
and that the principle of spending
money to be paid by posterity


1169
1:19:19,279 --> 1:19:23,127
under the name of funding, is but
swindling futurity on a large scale"


1170
1:19:23,127 --> 1:19:26,662
Letter from Thomas Jefferson
to John Taylor (May 28, 1816)


1171
1:19:26,662 --> 1:19:29,887
"Banking was conceived in
iniquity and was born in sin.


1172
1:19:29,887 --> 1:19:33,688
The bankers own the Earth...
If you wish to remain the slaves of bankers


1173
1:19:33,688 --> 1:19:37,68
and pay the cost of your own slavery,
let them continue to create money."


1174
1:19:37,68 --> 1:19:40,356
Sir Josiah Stamp, University
of Texas speech, 1927


1175
1:19:40,356 --> 1:19:44,31
By the early 20th century, the US
had already implemented and removed


1176
1:19:44,31 --> 1:19:47,83
a few central banking systems,
which were maneuvered into place


1177
1:19:47,83 --> 1:19:49,947
by ruthless banking interests.


1178
1:19:49,947 --> 1:19:53,433
At this time, the dominant families
in the banking and business world


1179
1:19:53,433 --> 1:19:58,32
were the Rockefellers, the Morgans,
the Warburgs, the Rothschilds.


1180
1:19:58,32 --> 1:20:1,557
In the early 1900's, they
sought to push once again


1181
1:20:1,557 --> 1:20:5,483
legislation to create
another central bank.


1182
1:20:5,483 --> 1:20:7,714
However, they knew the
government and public


1183
1:20:7,714 --> 1:20:10,133
were very weary of
such an institution.


1184
1:20:10,133 --> 1:20:14,375
They needed to create an incident
to affect public opinion.


1185
1:20:14,375 --> 1:20:18,852
JP Morgan, publicly considered a
financial luminary at the time


1186
1:20:18,852 --> 1:20:22,783
exploited his mass influence
by reportedly creating rumors


1187
1:20:22,783 --> 1:20:26,462
that prominent banks in New York
were insolvent, or bankrupt.


1188
1:20:26,462 --> 1:20:30,864
Morgan knew this would trigger mass
hysteria and a systemic crisis.


1189
1:20:30,864 --> 1:20:34,17
And it did. The public, in
fear of losing their deposits


1190
1:20:34,17 --> 1:20:36,182
immediately began
mass withdrawals.


1191
1:20:36,182 --> 1:20:39,213
Consequently, the banks were
forced to call in their loans


1192
1:20:39,213 --> 1:20:41,91
causing the recipients
to sell their property


1193
1:20:41,91 --> 1:20:47,178
and thus a spiral of bankruptcies,
repossessions, and turmoil emerged.


1194
1:20:47,178 --> 1:20:51,269
Putting the pieces together years later,
Congressman Charles Lindbergh wrote:


1195
1:20:51,269 --> 1:20:55,141
"The King Bankers put in motion,
in 1907, a great scheme.


1196
1:20:55,141 --> 1:20:57,344
They had gambled and
speculated on Wall Street


1197
1:20:57,344 --> 1:21:1,47
until so many watered stocks and
bonds had been manufactured...


1198
1:21:1,47 --> 1:21:3,282
The King Bankers knew the
condition and informed


1199
1:21:3,282 --> 1:21:5,916
the favored of their
friends what was to come.


1200
1:21:5,916 --> 1:21:9,682
There was to be a panic in the fall
of 1907 that would be advertised


1201
1:21:9,682 --> 1:21:14,211
as the result of our bad
banking and currency laws."


1202
1:21:14,211 --> 1:21:17,92
The Panic of 1907 led to a
Congressional investigation


1203
1:21:17,92 --> 1:21:20,129
headed by Senator Nelson Aldrich


1204
1:21:20,129 --> 1:21:22,665
who had intimate ties
to the financial powers


1205
1:21:22,665 --> 1:21:26,278
and later became part of Rockefeller
family through marriage.


1206
1:21:26,278 --> 1:21:29,234
The Commission led by Aldrich
recommended a Central Bank


1207
1:21:29,234 --> 1:21:34,671
should be implemented so a panic
like 1907 could never happen again.


1208
1:21:34,671 --> 1:21:38,102
This was the spark that the bankers
needed to initiate their plan


1209
1:21:38,102 --> 1:21:41,947
and in 1910 a secret meeting
was held at JP Morgan estate


1210
1:21:41,947 --> 1:21:44,692
on Jekyll Island off
the coast of Georgia.


1211
1:21:44,692 --> 1:21:47,3
It was there where the
Central Banking Bill


1212
1:21:47,3 --> 1:21:49,743
called 'The Federal
Reserve Act' was written.


1213
1:21:49,743 --> 1:21:53,397
This legislation was written
by bankers, not lawmakers.


1214
1:21:53,397 --> 1:21:56,626
This meeting was so secretive,
so concealed from government


1215
1:21:56,626 --> 1:21:59,411
and public knowledge that most
of the figures who attended


1216
1:21:59,411 --> 1:22:2,944
disguised their names when
in route to the island.


1217
1:22:2,944 --> 1:22:5,502
After this bill was constructed,
it was then handed over


1218
1:22:5,502 --> 1:22:10,396
to their political frontman, Senator
Nelson Aldrich, to push through Congress.


1219
1:22:10,396 --> 1:22:14,525
In 1913, with heavy political
sponsorship by the bankers


1220
1:22:14,525 --> 1:22:17,984
Woodrow Wilson became President,
having already agreed to sign


1221
1:22:17,984 --> 1:22:21,64
the Federal Reserve Act in
exchange for campaign support.


1222
1:22:21,64 --> 1:22:24,485
A few days before Christmas,
when much of Congress


1223
1:22:24,485 --> 1:22:28,1
was at home with their families, the
Federal Reserve Act was voted in


1224
1:22:28,1 --> 1:22:30,667
and Wilson made it law.


1225
1:22:30,667 --> 1:22:34,872
The night before its passage,
Congressman Charles Lindbergh pleaded:


1226
1:22:34,872 --> 1:22:37,959
"This act establishes the most
gigantic trust on Earth...


1227
1:22:37,959 --> 1:22:40,88
When the President signs this
act, the invisible government


1228
1:22:40,88 --> 1:22:44,55
by the money power
will be legalized."


1229
1:22:44,55 --> 1:22:47,684
The public was told that
the Federal Reserve System


1230
1:22:47,684 --> 1:22:51,852
was an economic stabilizer and
inflation and economic crisis


1231
1:22:51,852 --> 1:22:53,821
were a thing of the past.


1232
1:22:53,821 --> 1:22:57,445
As history has shown, nothing
was further from the truth.


1233
1:22:57,445 --> 1:23:0,761
The fact is the bankers now
had a streamlined machine


1234
1:23:0,761 --> 1:23:3,436
for economic manipulation.


1235
1:23:3,436 --> 1:23:7,666
(From the movie 'Frankenstein'
,1931) It's alive!


1236
1:23:7,666 --> 1:23:13,431
For example, from 1914 to 1919, the FED
substantially increased the money supply


1237
1:23:13,431 --> 1:23:17,348
resulting in extensive loans
to small banks and the public.


1238
1:23:17,348 --> 1:23:21,953
Then in 1920, the FED deliberately
contracted credit in an extreme way


1239
1:23:21,953 --> 1:23:25,223
thus resulting in banks having to
call in large numbers of loans


1240
1:23:25,223 --> 1:23:31,5
and just like 1907, bank runs, bankruptcy
and systemic collapse occurred.


1241
1:23:31,5 --> 1:23:35,257
Numerous competitive banks outside of
the Federal Reserve System collapsed


1242
1:23:35,257 --> 1:23:41,492
further consolidating the monopoly
of the money trust cartel.


1243
1:23:41,492 --> 1:23:45,13
Privy to this scheme, Congressman
Charles Lindbergh pronounced:


1244
1:23:45,13 --> 1:23:48,831
"Under the Federal Reserve Act,
panics are scientifically created.


1245
1:23:48,831 --> 1:23:51,718
The present panic is the first
scientifically created one


1246
1:23:51,718 --> 1:23:56,17
worked out as we figure a
mathematical equation."


1247
1:23:56,17 --> 1:23:59,723
However, the panic of
1920 was just a warm-up.


1248
1:23:59,723 --> 1:24:4,281
From 1921 to 1929 the FED again
increased the money supply


1249
1:24:4,281 --> 1:24:8,408
resulting once again in extensive
loans to the public and banks.


1250
1:24:8,408 --> 1:24:11,647
There was also a fairly new type
of loan in the stock market:


1251
1:24:11,647 --> 1:24:14,64
the Broker Call Loan.
Very simply


1252
1:24:14,64 --> 1:24:17,374
this loan allowed an investor
to put down only a fraction


1253
1:24:17,374 --> 1:24:21,29
of the stock's value, with the
rest being loaned from the broker.


1254
1:24:21,29 --> 1:24:24,293
This method was very popular
in the roaring '20s


1255
1:24:24,293 --> 1:24:26,932
as everyone seemed to be
making money in the market.


1256
1:24:26,932 --> 1:24:29,76
However, there was a
catch to this loan.


1257
1:24:29,76 --> 1:24:33,601
It could be called in at any time,
and had to be paid within 24 hours.


1258
1:24:33,601 --> 1:24:38,924
and the typical result was the selling
of the stock purchased with that loan.


1259
1:24:38,924 --> 1:24:42,44
A few months before
October in 1929


1260
1:24:42,44 --> 1:24:45,273
JD Rockefeller, Bernard
Baruck, and other insiders


1261
1:24:45,273 --> 1:24:49,49
quietly exited the market, knowing the
bubble created was about to burst.


1262
1:24:49,49 --> 1:24:54,64
On October 24th, 1929, the financiers
who furnished the call loans


1263
1:24:54,64 --> 1:24:57,257
started calling
them in, in mass.


1264
1:24:57,257 --> 1:25:1,622
This sparked an instantaneous massive
sell-off in the already inflated market


1265
1:25:1,622 --> 1:25:4,904
as sell orders and margin calls
were systemically triggered.


1266
1:25:4,904 --> 1:25:9,339
That then lead to mass bank runs,
eventually collapsing thousands of banks


1267
1:25:9,339 --> 1:25:16,101
enabling the large banks to buy up
the now failed ones at a discount.


1268
1:25:16,101 --> 1:25:18,1
But it didn't stop there.


1269
1:25:18,1 --> 1:25:20,651
Rather than expanding the money
supply in order to recover


1270
1:25:20,651 --> 1:25:25,2
from this economic collapse,
the FED actually contracted it


1271
1:25:25,2 --> 1:25:30,264
fueling one of the largest
depressions in American history.


1272
1:25:30,264 --> 1:25:33,378
Outraged, Congressman Louis
McFadden then Chairman


1273
1:25:33,378 --> 1:25:36,991
of the House Banking Committee
filed petition for impeachment


1274
1:25:36,991 --> 1:25:40,5
against the Federal
Reserve Board, stating:


1275
1:25:40,5 --> 1:25:42,167
"Mr. Chairman, we
have in this country


1276
1:25:42,167 --> 1:25:45,308
one of the most corrupt institutions
the world has ever known.


1277
1:25:45,308 --> 1:25:49,22
I refer to the Federal Reserve Board
and the Federal Reserve banks.


1278
1:25:49,22 --> 1:25:52,311
This evil institution has
impoverished and ruined the people


1279
1:25:52,311 --> 1:25:56,349
of the United States...
and has practically bankrupted our government.


1280
1:25:56,349 --> 1:26:0,163
It has done this through the defects
of the law under which it operates.


1281
1:26:0,163 --> 1:26:3,904
Through the maladministration of that
law by the Federal Reserve Board


1282
1:26:3,904 --> 1:26:9,394
and through the corrupt practices of
the moneyed vultures who control it."


1283
1:26:9,394 --> 1:26:12,48
Having reduced the
society to squalor


1284
1:26:12,48 --> 1:26:15,3
it was then decided that the
gold standard should be removed.


1285
1:26:15,3 --> 1:26:19,217
In order to do this, they needed to
acquire the remaining gold in the system.


1286
1:26:19,217 --> 1:26:23,33
Under the pretense of helping
to end the depression


1287
1:26:23,33 --> 1:26:25,303
came the 1933 gold seizure.


1288
1:26:25,303 --> 1:26:28,804
Under the threat of imprisonment
for 10 years, everyone in America


1289
1:26:28,804 --> 1:26:32,87
was required to turn in all
gold bullion to the Treasury


1290
1:26:32,87 --> 1:26:35,93
essentially robbing the public of what
little real wealth they had left.


1291
1:26:35,93 --> 1:26:39,247
At the end of 1933, the gold
standard was abolished.


1292
1:26:39,247 --> 1:26:44,344
If you look at a dollar bill before
1933, it says it is redeemable in gold.


1293
1:26:44,344 --> 1:26:47,74
You look at the dollar bill today,
it says it is legal tender


1294
1:26:47,74 --> 1:26:50,246
which means it is backed
by absolutely nothing.


1295
1:26:50,246 --> 1:26:53,603
The only thing that gives our
money value is the public faith


1296
1:26:53,603 --> 1:26:55,934
and how much of it
is in circulation.


1297
1:26:55,934 --> 1:26:58,711
Therefore, the power to
regulate the money supply


1298
1:26:58,711 --> 1:27:1,335
is also the power to
regulate its value


1299
1:27:1,335 --> 1:27:6,43
which is also the power to manipulate
and control entire economies.


1300
1:27:6,43 --> 1:27:9,232
"Whoever controls the volume
of money in any country


1301
1:27:9,232 --> 1:27:12,82
is absolute master of all
industry and commerce."


1302
1:27:12,82 --> 1:27:14,35
James A. Garfield, 20th
president of the United States


1303
1:27:14,35 --> 1:27:16,5
It is important to
clearly understand:


1304
1:27:16,5 --> 1:27:19,254
The Federal Reserve is
a private corporation.


1305
1:27:19,254 --> 1:27:22,251
It is about as 'federal'
as Federal Express.


1306
1:27:22,251 --> 1:27:25,16
It makes its own policies and
is under little regulation


1307
1:27:25,16 --> 1:27:27,606
by the US government.
It is a private bank


1308
1:27:27,606 --> 1:27:31,79
that loans all the currency
at interest to the government


1309
1:27:31,79 --> 1:27:34,454
completely consistent with
the central banking model


1310
1:27:34,454 --> 1:27:37,881
that the country sought to escape
from when it declared independence


1311
1:27:37,881 --> 1:27:40,115
in the American
Revolutionary War.


1312
1:27:40,115 --> 1:27:44,342
Going back to 1913, the Federal
Reserve Act was not the only bill


1313
1:27:44,342 --> 1:27:47,373
pushed through Congress for the
vested financial interests.


1314
1:27:47,373 --> 1:27:51,712
They also pushed its partner:
the federal income tax.


1315
1:27:51,712 --> 1:27:55,795
First of all, the federal income
tax is completely unconstitutional


1316
1:27:55,795 --> 1:27:58,403
as it is a direct,
unapportioned tax.


1317
1:27:58,403 --> 1:28:1,471
And the required number of
states needed in order to ratify


1318
1:28:1,471 --> 1:28:5,803
the amendment to allow the
income tax was never legally met


1319
1:28:5,803 --> 1:28:8,772
and this has even been cited
in modern court cases.


1320
1:28:8,772 --> 1:28:11,917
"If you were to go back and try to
find and review the ratification


1321
1:28:11,917 --> 1:28:15,399
of the 16th amendment...
you would find that a sufficient number of states


1322
1:28:15,399 --> 1:28:18,737
never ratified that amendment."
- US District Court Judge JC Fox, 2003


1323
1:28:18,737 --> 1:28:22,775
Second, at the present day, roughly
25% of the average worker's income


1324
1:28:22,775 --> 1:28:24,93
is taken from them via this tax.


1325
1:28:24,93 --> 1:28:27,454
That means you work 3 months
out of the year to fulfill


1326
1:28:27,454 --> 1:28:30,917
this tax obligation and
where does that money go?


1327
1:28:30,917 --> 1:28:34,308
According to the Grace
Commission Report of the '80s:


1328
1:28:34,308 --> 1:28:37,881
"100% of what is collected is
absorbed solely by interest


1329
1:28:37,881 --> 1:28:41,37
on the federal debt and by
federal government contributions


1330
1:28:41,37 --> 1:28:45,26
to transfer payments. In other words,
all individual income tax revenues


1331
1:28:45,26 --> 1:28:48,383
are gone before one nickel
is spent on the services


1332
1:28:48,383 --> 1:28:51,231
which taxpayers expect
from their government."


1333
1:28:51,231 --> 1:28:54,501
Today, the money Americans make
working 3 months out of the year


1334
1:28:54,501 --> 1:28:57,475
goes almost entirely
to the interest fees


1335
1:28:57,475 --> 1:29:0,645
charged for the
debt-based fiat currency.


1336
1:29:0,645 --> 1:29:5,688
The fact is, the Federal Income Tax
exists to feed the Federal Reserve


1337
1:29:5,688 --> 1:29:8,2
federal government money machine


1338
1:29:8,2 --> 1:29:11,357
making sure the interest
payments are always there.


1339
1:29:11,357 --> 1:29:16,83
And 3) Even with the government claim
as to the legality of the income tax


1340
1:29:16,83 --> 1:29:18,46
there is evidently
no clear statute.


1341
1:29:18,46 --> 1:29:22,503
No law in existence that
requires you to pay this tax.


1342
1:29:22,503 --> 1:29:25,876
(Former IRS agent)
I really expected
that of course there's a law


1343
1:29:25,876 --> 1:29:28,385
that you can point
to in the law book


1344
1:29:28,385 --> 1:29:32,302
a code, that requires you to file tax return.
Of course there is!


1345
1:29:32,302 --> 1:29:35,152
I was at that point where I
couldn't find the statute


1346
1:29:35,152 --> 1:29:37,999
that clearly made
a person liable


1347
1:29:37,999 --> 1:29:41,237
at least not me and
most people I know


1348
1:29:41,237 --> 1:29:44,9
and I had no choice in my
mind except to resign.


1349
1:29:44,9 --> 1:29:48,91
Based on the research that I
did throughout the year 2000


1350
1:29:48,91 --> 1:29:50,785
and that I'm still doing, I
have not found that law!


1351
1:29:50,785 --> 1:29:53,999
I've asked Congress, we've asked
a lot of people in the IRS


1352
1:29:53,999 --> 1:29:57,414
the IRS Commissioners' helpers.
They can't answer


1353
1:29:57,414 --> 1:30:0,38
because if they answer, the
American people are going to know


1354
1:30:0,38 --> 1:30:2,119
that this whole
thing is a fraud.


1355
1:30:2,119 --> 1:30:6,8
I haven't filed a federal
income tax return since I left.


1356
1:30:6,8 --> 1:30:9,895
I have not filed a tax
return since 1999.


1357
1:30:9,895 --> 1:30:13,128
(Joseph)
Now, the control of the economy
and the manipulation of society


1358
1:30:13,128 --> 1:30:18,41
for the vested financial powers is
only a part of the game being played.


1359
1:30:18,41 --> 1:30:22,639
Another level is the
business of war.


1360
1:30:22,639 --> 1:30:25,902
Since the inception of the
Federal Reserve in 1913


1361
1:30:25,902 --> 1:30:28,389
a number of large and small
wars have commenced.


1362
1:30:28,389 --> 1:30:31,14
The three most pronounced
might be World War I


1363
1:30:31,14 --> 1:30:33,533
World War 2 and Vietnam.


1364
1:30:33,533 --> 1:30:37,95
World War 1: In 1914
European wars broke out


1365
1:30:37,95 --> 1:30:39,295
centered around
England and Germany.


1366
1:30:39,295 --> 1:30:41,924
The American public wanted
nothing to do with the war.


1367
1:30:41,924 --> 1:30:45,549
In turn, president Woodrow Wilson
publicly declared neutrality.


1368
1:30:45,549 --> 1:30:48,143
However, under the surface,
evidence now shows


1369
1:30:48,143 --> 1:30:50,404
that the financial powers
behind the Administration


1370
1:30:50,404 --> 1:30:53,76
were looking for any excuse
it could to enter it.


1371
1:30:53,76 --> 1:30:56,649
It is important to understand that
one of the most lucrative things


1372
1:30:56,649 --> 1:30:59,188
that can happen for
the bankers is war


1373
1:30:59,188 --> 1:31:2,875
for it forces the country to
borrow even more money at interest


1374
1:31:2,875 --> 1:31:7,724
not to mention the profits generated through
the financing of military productions.


1375
1:31:7,724 --> 1:31:10,527
In the words of two-time
Congressional Medal of Honor winner


1376
1:31:10,527 --> 1:31:14,983
Smedley D. Butler "War is a racket.
It always has been.


1377
1:31:14,983 --> 1:31:18,266
It is possibly the oldest,
easily the most profitable


1378
1:31:18,266 --> 1:31:22,42
and surely the most vicious.
It is the only one international in scope


1379
1:31:22,42 --> 1:31:25,215
and it is the only one in which the
profits are reckoned in dollars


1380
1:31:25,215 --> 1:31:27,92
and the losses of lives."


1381
1:31:27,92 --> 1:31:32,4
Woodrow Wilson's top adviser and
mentor was Colonel Edward House


1382
1:31:32,4 --> 1:31:34,194
a man found to have
intimate connections


1383
1:31:34,194 --> 1:31:36,444
with the financial
interests of the time.


1384
1:31:36,444 --> 1:31:39,602
In a conversation between
Colonel House, Wilson's adviser


1385
1:31:39,602 --> 1:31:42,455
and Sir Edward Grey, the
Foreign Secretary of England


1386
1:31:42,455 --> 1:31:46,9
regarding America and
the war, Grey inquired:


1387
1:31:46,9 --> 1:31:48,598
"What will America do if
Germans sink an ocean liner


1388
1:31:48,598 --> 1:31:51,765
with American passengers on board?
" House responded:


1389
1:31:51,765 --> 1:31:54,923
"I believe that a flame of indignation
would sweep the United States


1390
1:31:54,923 --> 1:31:59,127
and that by itself would be
sufficient to carry us into war."


1391
1:31:59,127 --> 1:32:2,718
On May 7th 1915, a ship
called the 'Lusitania'


1392
1:32:2,718 --> 1:32:6,215
was sent where German military
vessels were known to be.


1393
1:32:6,215 --> 1:32:9,899
As likely expected, German
U-boats torpedoed the ship


1394
1:32:9,899 --> 1:32:14,926
exploding stored munitions,
killing 1200 people.


1395
1:32:14,926 --> 1:32:18,292
To further understand the obvious
anticipation of this setup


1396
1:32:18,292 --> 1:32:22,174
the German Embassy actually put
advertisements in the New York Times


1397
1:32:22,174 --> 1:32:26,78
telling people that if they boarded the
Lusitania they did so at their own risk


1398
1:32:26,78 --> 1:32:29,407
as such a ship sailing from America
to England through the war zone


1399
1:32:29,407 --> 1:32:31,635
would be liable to destruction.


1400
1:32:31,635 --> 1:32:34,75
In turn and as anticipated,
the sinking of the Lusitania


1401
1:32:34,75 --> 1:32:38,268
created a wave of anger among
the American population


1402
1:32:38,268 --> 1:32:42,379
and America entered the
war a short time after.


1403
1:32:42,379 --> 1:32:44,674
Major General 
Smedley D. Butler summarizes


1404
1:32:44,674 --> 1:32:48,441
the monetary reality
of World War I:


1405
1:32:48,441 --> 1:32:51,782
"Looking back, Woodrow Wilson was
re-elected president in 1916 on a platform


1406
1:32:51,782 --> 1:32:54,974
that he had "kept us out of war".
Yet, five months later he asked Congress


1407
1:32:54,974 --> 1:32:57,4
to declare war on Germany...
The 4 million young men


1408
1:32:57,4 --> 1:33:0,173
who put on uniforms and marched
or sailed away were not asked


1409
1:33:0,173 --> 1:33:2,536
whether they wanted to go
forth to suffer and die.


1410
1:33:2,536 --> 1:33:5,588
Then what caused our government to
change its mind so suddenly? Money.


1411
1:33:5,588 --> 1:33:8,536
An Allied Commission...
came over shortly before the war declaration


1412
1:33:8,536 --> 1:33:11,623
and called on the President, who
summoned a group of advisers.


1413
1:33:11,623 --> 1:33:14,604
The head of the Commission spoke.
Stripped of its diplomatic language


1414
1:33:14,604 --> 1:33:17,519
this is what he told the President
and his group: "There is no use


1415
1:33:17,519 --> 1:33:20,298
kidding ourselves any longer.
The cause of the Allies is lost.


1416
1:33:20,298 --> 1:33:23,4
We now owe you American bankers,
American munitions makers


1417
1:33:23,4 --> 1:33:25,82
American manufacturers, American
speculators, American exporters


1418
1:33:25,82 --> 1:33:28,541
5 or so billion dollars.
If we lose (and without the help


1419
1:33:28,541 --> 1:33:31,46
of the US we must lose), we,
England, France and Italy


1420
1:33:31,46 --> 1:33:33,372
cannot pay back this money...
and Germany won't."


1421
1:33:33,372 --> 1:33:36,391
It has been estimated by statisticians,
economists and researchers


1422
1:33:36,391 --> 1:33:39,791
that the war yielded $16 billion in profits.
That is how the 21,000 billionaires


1423
1:33:39,791 --> 1:33:43,185
and millionaires got that way.
This $16 billion profits is not to be sneezed at.


1424
1:33:43,185 --> 1:33:45,383
It is quite a tidy sum.
And it went to very few."


1425
1:33:45,383 --> 1:33:47,66
World War II


1426
1:33:47,66 --> 1:33:51,954
On December 7th 1941, Japan attacked
the American fleet at Pearl Harbor


1427
1:33:51,954 --> 1:33:54,336
triggering US entry
into that war.


1428
1:33:54,336 --> 1:33:57,303
President Franklin D.
Roosevelt declared the attack was:


1429
1:33:57,303 --> 1:34:1,185
'a day that will live in infamy'.
A day of infamy indeed


1430
1:34:1,185 --> 1:34:4,655
but not because of the alleged
surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.


1431
1:34:4,655 --> 1:34:7,584
After 60 years of surfacing
information it is clear


1432
1:34:7,584 --> 1:34:10,525
that not only was the attack
known well in advance


1433
1:34:10,525 --> 1:34:13,528
it was outright
wanted and provoked.


1434
1:34:13,528 --> 1:34:17,826
In a journal entry by Roosevelt's
Secretary of War Henry Stimson


1435
1:34:17,826 --> 1:34:22,114
dated November 25th, 1941,
he documented a conversation


1436
1:34:22,114 --> 1:34:25,9
he had with Roosevelt: "The question
was how we should maneuver them


1437
1:34:25,9 --> 1:34:29,719
into firing the first shot...
" and in Congressional testimony


1438
1:34:29,719 --> 1:34:32,247
he later added: "It was
desirable to make sure


1439
1:34:32,247 --> 1:34:36,7
the Japanese be the ones to do this
so that there should remain no doubt


1440
1:34:36,7 --> 1:34:38,178
as to who were the aggressors."


1441
1:34:38,178 --> 1:34:40,607
In the months leading up to
the attack on Pearl Harbor


1442
1:34:40,607 --> 1:34:42,811
Roosevelt had done almost
everything in his power


1443
1:34:42,811 --> 1:34:45,89
to anger the Japanese, showing
a posture of aggression.


1444
1:34:45,89 --> 1:34:49,38
He halted all of Japan's
imports of American petroleum.


1445
1:34:49,38 --> 1:34:51,931
He froze all the Japanese
assets in the United States.


1446
1:34:51,931 --> 1:34:55,583
He made public loans to Nationalist
China and supplied military aid


1447
1:34:55,583 --> 1:34:58,363
to the British, both enemies
of Japan in the war


1448
1:34:58,363 --> 1:35:2,124
which, by the way, was in complete
violation of international war rules.


1449
1:35:2,124 --> 1:35:5,62
With numerous Japanese
codes broken in advance


1450
1:35:5,62 --> 1:35:8,575
revealing the plan to attack,
on December 7th 1941


1451
1:35:8,575 --> 1:35:14,323
Japan was allowed to attack Pearl
Harbor killing 2400 soldiers.


1452
1:35:14,323 --> 1:35:18,111
Before Pearl Harbor, 83% of the
American public wanted nothing to do


1453
1:35:18,111 --> 1:35:20,564
with the war. After Pearl Harbor


1454
1:35:20,564 --> 1:35:27,207
one million men
volunteered for that war.


1455
1:35:27,207 --> 1:35:31,243
It is important to note, Nazi Germany's
war effort was largely supported


1456
1:35:31,243 --> 1:35:34,656
by two organizations, one of
which was called IG Farben.


1457
1:35:34,656 --> 1:35:38,104
IG Farben produced 84%
of Germany's explosives.


1458
1:35:38,104 --> 1:35:40,63
One of the unspoken
partners of IG Farben


1459
1:35:40,63 --> 1:35:44,739
was JD Rockefeller's Standard
Oil Company in America.


1460
1:35:44,739 --> 1:35:48,763
The German Air Force could not
operate without a special additive


1461
1:35:48,763 --> 1:35:51,429
patented by Rockefeller's
Standard Oil.


1462
1:35:51,429 --> 1:35:54,844
The drastic bombing of London
by Nazi Germany for example


1463
1:35:54,844 --> 1:35:58,752
was made possible by a $20 million
sale of fuel to IG Farben


1464
1:35:58,752 --> 1:36:1,263
by the Rockefeller's
Standard Oil Company.


1465
1:36:1,263 --> 1:36:4,878
This is just one small point on the
topic of how American businesses


1466
1:36:4,878 --> 1:36:7,897
funded both sides
of World War II.


1467
1:36:7,897 --> 1:36:10,51
One other treasonous
organization worth mentioning


1468
1:36:10,51 --> 1:36:13,366
is the Union Banking
Corporation of New York City.


1469
1:36:13,366 --> 1:36:17,98
Not only did they finance numerous
aspects of Hitler's rise to power


1470
1:36:17,98 --> 1:36:19,548
along with actual
materials during the war


1471
1:36:19,548 --> 1:36:23,819
it was also a Nazi money laundering
bank, which was eventually exposed


1472
1:36:23,819 --> 1:36:27,204
for having millions of dollars
of Nazi money in its vaults.


1473
1:36:27,204 --> 1:36:30,524
The Union Banking Corporation of
New York was eventually seized


1474
1:36:30,524 --> 1:36:33,577
for violations of the
Trading with the Enemy Act.


1475
1:36:33,577 --> 1:36:37,147
Guess who the director and Vice
President of the Union Bank was?


1476
1:36:37,147 --> 1:36:41,439
Prescott Bush, the father and
grandfather of former US President


1477
1:36:41,439 --> 1:36:46,52
George W.
Bush and George HW Bush.


1478
1:36:46,52 --> 1:36:51,48
Vietnam: United States official
escalation and entry in the Vietnam War


1479
1:36:51,48 --> 1:36:54,731
came after an alleged incident
involving two US destroyers


1480
1:36:54,731 --> 1:36:59,99
being attacked by North Vietnamese
PT boats in the Gulf of Tonkin.


1481
1:36:59,99 --> 1:37:1,672
This was known as the
Gulf of Tonkin Incident.


1482
1:37:1,672 --> 1:37:5,732
This situation was the catalystic
pretext for massive troop deployment


1483
1:37:5,732 --> 1:37:9,855
and full fledged warfare.
One problem, however


1484
1:37:9,855 --> 1:37:13,246
the attack on the US destroyers
by Vietnamese PT boats


1485
1:37:13,246 --> 1:37:15,152
never happened.


1486
1:37:15,152 --> 1:37:18,839
Former Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara stated years later


1487
1:37:18,839 --> 1:37:22,22
that the Gulf of Tonkin
incident was a 'mistake'


1488
1:37:22,22 --> 1:37:25,105
while declassified documents
released years later show


1489
1:37:25,105 --> 1:37:28,765
that it was a farce, manipulated
for the purposes of war


1490
1:37:28,765 --> 1:37:32,181
and once in the war, it
was business as usual.


1491
1:37:32,181 --> 1:37:36,459
In October 1966, President Lyndon
Johnson lifted trade restrictions


1492
1:37:36,459 --> 1:37:39,387
on the Soviet Block knowing
full well that the Soviets


1493
1:37:39,387 --> 1:37:43,662
were providing upwards of 80% of
North Vietnam's war supplies.


1494
1:37:43,662 --> 1:37:47,37
Consequently, the Rockefeller
interests financed factories


1495
1:37:47,37 --> 1:37:49,989
in the Soviet Union, which the
Soviets used to manufacture


1496
1:37:49,989 --> 1:37:53,189
military equipment and
send it to North Vietnam.


1497
1:37:53,189 --> 1:37:56,84
However, the funding of
both sides in this conflict


1498
1:37:56,84 --> 1:37:58,14
was only one side of the coin.


1499
1:37:58,14 --> 1:38:1,79
In 1985, Vietnam's Rules of
Engagement were declassified.


1500
1:38:1,79 --> 1:38:5,974
This detailed what American troops were
and were not allow to do in the war.


1501
1:38:5,974 --> 1:38:10,624
It included such absurdities as: North
Vietnamese anti-aircraft missile systems


1502
1:38:10,624 --> 1:38:14,59
could not be bombed until they were
known to be fully operational.


1503
1:38:14,59 --> 1:38:16,268
No enemy could be pursued
once they crossed


1504
1:38:16,268 --> 1:38:18,308
the border of Laos or Cambodia.


1505
1:38:18,308 --> 1:38:21,579
Most revealing of all, the most
critical strategic targets


1506
1:38:21,579 --> 1:38:26,272
were not allow to be attacked, unless
initiated by high military officials.


1507
1:38:26,272 --> 1:38:30,101
Apart from these illogical limitations,
North Vietnam was informed


1508
1:38:30,101 --> 1:38:33,57
of these restrictions and therefore
could base entire strategies


1509
1:38:33,57 --> 1:38:36,55
around the limitations
of the American Forces.


1510
1:38:36,55 --> 1:38:40,302
This is why the war went on for so
long and the bottom line is this:


1511
1:38:40,302 --> 1:38:45,66
The Vietnam War was never meant
to be won, just sustained.


1512
1:38:45,66 --> 1:38:49,773
This war for profit and resources
resulted in 58,000 American deaths


1513
1:38:49,773 --> 1:38:54,482
and 3 million dead Vietnamese.


1514
1:38:54,482 --> 1:38:56,934
Where are we now?


1515
1:38:56,934 --> 1:39:0,629
September 11th was the jump-start
for a hegemonic agenda


1516
1:39:0,629 --> 1:39:4,37
enabling the possibility of
constant global warfare.


1517
1:39:4,37 --> 1:39:8,656
It was a staged war pretext no different
than the sinking of the Lusitania


1518
1:39:8,656 --> 1:39:12,4
the provoking of Pearl Harbor
and the Gulf of Tonkin lie.


1519
1:39:12,4 --> 1:39:15,212
If 9/11 wasn't a
planned war pretext


1520
1:39:15,212 --> 1:39:17,185
it would be an
exception to the rule.


1521
1:39:17,185 --> 1:39:20,554
It has been used to launch
two unprovoked illegal wars:


1522
1:39:20,554 --> 1:39:23,631
one against Iraq and one
against Afghanistan.


1523
1:39:23,631 --> 1:39:27,178
However, 9/11 was the pretext
for another war as well.


1524
1:39:27,178 --> 1:39:29,789
The war against you.
The Patriot Act


1525
1:39:29,789 --> 1:39:32,663
Homeland Security, the
Military Tribunals Act


1526
1:39:32,663 --> 1:39:35,863
and other legislations are
all completely designed


1527
1:39:35,863 --> 1:39:40,378
to destroy your civil liberties
and protect those in power.


1528
1:39:40,378 --> 1:39:43,834
Currently in the United States,
unannounced to most Americans


1529
1:39:43,834 --> 1:39:48,37
your home can be searched without a
warrant, without you being home.


1530
1:39:48,37 --> 1:39:52,326
You can in turn be detained indefinitely
with no charges revealed to you


1531
1:39:52,326 --> 1:39:55,477
no access to a lawyer
and legally tortured.


1532
1:39:55,477 --> 1:40:0,419
All under the suspicion that
you might be a 'terrorist'.


1533
1:40:0,419 --> 1:40:2,85
If you need a painted picture
of what is happening


1534
1:40:2,85 --> 1:40:5,799
let's recognize how
history repeats itself.


1535
1:40:5,799 --> 1:40:9,844
In February 1933, Hitler
staged the false flag attack


1536
1:40:9,844 --> 1:40:13,208
burning down his own German
parliament building the Reichstag


1537
1:40:13,208 --> 1:40:18,262
blaming it on
communist terrorists.


1538
1:40:18,262 --> 1:40:21,4
Within the next few weeks
he passed the Enabling Act


1539
1:40:21,4 --> 1:40:23,748
which completely eradicated
the German constitution


1540
1:40:23,748 --> 1:40:25,905
destroying people's liberties.


1541
1:40:25,905 --> 1:40:30,76
He then led a series of preemptive
wars, all justified as necessary


1542
1:40:30,76 --> 1:40:36,349
to maintaining
'homeland security'.


1543
1:40:36,349 --> 1:40:40,17
An evil exists that threatens
every man, woman and child


1544
1:40:40,17 --> 1:40:43,58
of this great nation.
We must take steps to ensure


1545
1:40:43,58 --> 1:40:46,104
our domestic security and
protect our homeland.


1546
1:40:46,104 --> 1:40:50,755
George W. Bush?


1547
1:40:50,755 --> 1:40:53,971
Adolf Hitler


1548
1:40:53,971 --> 1:40:58,32
when announcing the
Gestapo to the people.


1549
1:40:58,32 --> 1:41:3,997
On the matter of communism
and its front organizations


1550
1:41:3,997 --> 1:41:7,519
should not obscure the issues!


1551
1:41:7,519 --> 1:41:10,557
Our enemy is a radical
network of terrorists


1552
1:41:10,557 --> 1:41:16,572
and every government
that supports them.


1553
1:41:16,572 --> 1:41:18,629
(P.Joseph)
It's time to wake up.


1554
1:41:18,629 --> 1:41:21,336
The people in power go out
of their way to make sure


1555
1:41:21,336 --> 1:41:24,746
you are perpetually
mislead and manipulated.


1556
1:41:24,746 --> 1:41:26,961
The majorities'
perception of reality


1557
1:41:26,961 --> 1:41:30,457
especially in the political
arena is not their own.


1558
1:41:30,457 --> 1:41:34,774
It is shrewdly imposed upon them
without them even knowing it.


1559
1:41:34,774 --> 1:41:38,122
For example, the public at large
now believes the invasions of Iraq


1560
1:41:38,122 --> 1:41:41,24
and the Middle East, along
with the resulting instability


1561
1:41:41,24 --> 1:41:44,71
are the consequences of political
and military mistakes.


1562
1:41:44,71 --> 1:41:48,973
What the public fails to see is that
the destabilization of the Middle East


1563
1:41:48,973 --> 1:41:52,28
is exactly what the
Western interests want.


1564
1:41:52,28 --> 1:41:55,73
This war is to be sustained, so
the region can be divided up


1565
1:41:55,73 --> 1:41:59,225
domination of the oil maintained,
continual profits reaped


1566
1:41:59,225 --> 1:42:2,161
for defense contractors,
and most obviously


1567
1:42:2,161 --> 1:42:6,425
permanent military bases established
to be used as a launching pads


1568
1:42:6,425 --> 1:42:11,802
against other oil bearing,
non-conforming countries, such as Iran.


1569
1:42:11,802 --> 1:42:14,702
For further implication that the
Middle East destabilization


1570
1:42:14,702 --> 1:42:19,957
is purely intentional, in 2005,
two elite British SAS officers


1571
1:42:19,957 --> 1:42:23,534
were arrested by Iraqi police
after being caught driving around


1572
1:42:23,534 --> 1:42:28,329
in their car shooting at civilians
while dressed up as Arabs.


1573
1:42:28,329 --> 1:42:31,243
After being arrested and
taken to a jail in Basra


1574
1:42:31,243 --> 1:42:34,823
the British army immediately
demanded the release of these men.


1575
1:42:34,823 --> 1:42:37,915
When the Basra government
refused, British tanks came in


1576
1:42:37,915 --> 1:42:41,747
and physically broke out the
men from the Basra prison.


1577
1:42:41,747 --> 1:42:46,131
(L. LaRouche)
If you wish to
destroy an area, how do you do it?


1578
1:42:46,131 --> 1:42:48,453
There are two ways: You can
go in there and bomb it


1579
1:42:48,453 --> 1:42:50,599
but that is not very efficient.


1580
1:42:50,599 --> 1:42:53,75
What you do is you try to get the
people in that area to kill each other


1581
1:42:53,75 --> 1:42:57,377
and to destroy there own
territory, their own farms.


1582
1:42:57,377 --> 1:42:59,7
And that's what has
been done in that area.


1583
1:42:59,7 --> 1:43:3,803
The way in which you destroy
an opponent is by getting him


1584
1:43:3,803 --> 1:43:7,635
to destroy himself by dividing
his ranks against one another.


1585
1:43:7,635 --> 1:43:11,25
Then you feed both sides, you
have agents feeding both sides


1586
1:43:11,25 --> 1:43:14,786
inflaming both sides.
And they kill each other off.


1587
1:43:14,786 --> 1:43:19,185
It's time that some of us
woke up to this reality.


1588
1:43:19,185 --> 1:43:25,53
To understand that people who try to
maintain empires and create empires


1589
1:43:25,53 --> 1:43:30,119
do it by manipulating the people
they are trying to conquer.


1590
1:43:30,119 --> 1:43:32,989
(P. Joseph)
You might want to ask
yourself why the entire culture


1591
1:43:32,989 --> 1:43:37,397
is utterly saturated with mass
media entertainment from all sides


1592
1:43:37,397 --> 1:43:40,206
while the educational
system in America continues


1593
1:43:40,206 --> 1:43:42,406
its stupefying downward slide


1594
1:43:42,406 --> 1:43:44,875
since the US government
decided to take over


1595
1:43:44,875 --> 1:43:49,286
and subsidize the
public school system.


1596
1:43:49,286 --> 1:43:52,978
(J. Maxwell)
What your
government pays for, it gets.


1597
1:43:52,978 --> 1:43:57,679
When we understand that, then
we look at government financed


1598
1:43:57,679 --> 1:44:2,192
institutions of education and
see the kind of students


1599
1:44:2,192 --> 1:44:4,691
and the kind of education
that is being turned out


1600
1:44:4,691 --> 1:44:7,503
by these government-financed
schools


1601
1:44:7,503 --> 1:44:12,384
logic will tell you that if what is
being turned out in those schools


1602
1:44:12,384 --> 1:44:17,541
was not in accord with what the state
and the federal government wanted


1603
1:44:17,541 --> 1:44:20,41
then it would change it.


1604
1:44:20,41 --> 1:44:24,624
The bottom line is that the government
is getting what they have ordered.


1605
1:44:24,624 --> 1:44:30,307
They do not want your
children to be educated.


1606
1:44:30,307 --> 1:44:34,249
They do not want you
to think too much.


1607
1:44:34,249 --> 1:44:36,722
That is why our
country and our world


1608
1:44:36,722 --> 1:44:40,426
has become so proliferated
with entertainments


1609
1:44:40,426 --> 1:44:43,439
mass media, television shows


1610
1:44:43,439 --> 1:44:47,176
amusement parks, drugs, alcohol


1611
1:44:47,176 --> 1:44:52,464
and every kind of entertainment, to
keep the human mind entertained.


1612
1:44:52,464 --> 1:44:56,246
So that you don't get in the
way of important people


1613
1:44:56,246 --> 1:44:59,811
by doing too much thinking.


1614
1:44:59,811 --> 1:45:3,117
You had better wake up and
understand that there are people


1615
1:45:3,117 --> 1:45:6,36
who are guiding your life
and you don't even know it.


1616
1:45:6,36 --> 1:45:9,521
We are in a lot of trouble!


1617
1:45:9,521 --> 1:45:11,711
Because you people


1618
1:45:11,711 --> 1:45:15,87
and 62 million other Americans
are listening to me right now.


1619
1:45:15,87 --> 1:45:21,59
Because less than 3 percent
of you people read books.


1620
1:45:21,59 --> 1:45:24,759
Because less than 15 percent
of you read newspapers.


1621
1:45:24,759 --> 1:45:28,687
Because the only truth you know
is what you get over this tube.


1622
1:45:28,687 --> 1:45:33,521
Right now there is a whole, an entire
generation that never knew anything


1623
1:45:33,521 --> 1:45:36,671
that didn't come
out of this tube.


1624
1:45:36,671 --> 1:45:41,45
This tube is the gospel,
the ultimate revelation.


1625
1:45:41,45 --> 1:45:46,102
This tube can make or break
presidents, popes, prime ministers.


1626
1:45:46,102 --> 1:45:51,343
This tube is the most awesome goddamn
force in the whole godless world


1627
1:45:51,343 --> 1:45:54,16
and woe is us if it ever falls in
the hands of the wrong people.


1628
1:45:54,16 --> 1:45:56,682
And when the largest
company in the world


1629
1:45:56,682 --> 1:46:1,78
controls the most awesome
goddamn propaganda force


1630
1:46:1,78 --> 1:46:4,518
in the whole godless world
who knows what shit


1631
1:46:4,518 --> 1:46:7,233
will be peddled for
truth on this network.


1632
1:46:7,233 --> 1:46:10,427
So you listen to me.
Listen to me:


1633
1:46:10,427 --> 1:46:13,33
Television is not the truth.


1634
1:46:13,33 --> 1:46:15,675
Television is a goddamned
amusement park.


1635
1:46:15,675 --> 1:46:20,23
Television is a circus, a carnival,
a traveling troop of acrobats


1636
1:46:20,23 --> 1:46:23,714
story tellers, dancers, singers,
jugglers, sideshow freaks


1637
1:46:23,714 --> 1:46:26,218
lion tamers and
football players.


1638
1:46:26,218 --> 1:46:28,821
We are in the boredom
killing business!


1639
1:46:28,821 --> 1:46:33,146
But you people sit there day
after day, night after night


1640
1:46:33,146 --> 1:46:37,404
all ages, colors, creeds...
We are all you know!


1641
1:46:37,404 --> 1:46:40,211
You're beginning to believe the
illusions we are spinning here.


1642
1:46:40,211 --> 1:46:42,399
You are beginning to think
the tube is reality


1643
1:46:42,399 --> 1:46:44,491
and that your own
lives are unreal.


1644
1:46:44,491 --> 1:46:47,68
You do whatever the tube tells you.
You dress like the tube


1645
1:46:47,68 --> 1:46:50,402
eat like the tube, raise
your children like the tube


1646
1:46:50,402 --> 1:46:55,47
you even think like the tube.
This is mass madness, you maniacs!


1647
1:46:55,47 --> 1:46:58,256
In God's name you people
are the real thing.


1648
1:46:58,256 --> 1:47:3,696
We are the illusion!


1649
1:47:3,696 --> 1:47:6,197
(P. Joseph)
The last thing the
power establishment wants


1650
1:47:6,197 --> 1:47:10,614
is a conscious informed public
capable of critical thinking.


1651
1:47:10,614 --> 1:47:14,1
This is why a continually
fraudulent zeitgeist is output


1652
1:47:14,1 --> 1:47:17,821
via religion, the mass media,
and the educational system.


1653
1:47:17,821 --> 1:47:21,632
It is in their interest to keep
you in a distracted naive bubble.


1654
1:47:21,632 --> 1:47:25,89
And they are doing a
damn good job of it.


1655
1:47:25,89 --> 1:47:29,384
This is Aaron Russo, a filmmaker
and former politician.


1656
1:47:29,384 --> 1:47:34,238
To his left is Nicholas Rockefeller
of the Council on Foreign Relations.


1657
1:47:34,238 --> 1:47:37,264
After maintaining a close friendship
with Nicholas Rockefeller


1658
1:47:37,264 --> 1:47:41,843
Aaron eventually ended the relationship,
appalled by what he had learned.


1659
1:47:41,843 --> 1:47:45,908
(A. Russo)
I got a call one day
from an attorney woman I knew


1660
1:47:45,908 --> 1:47:48,765
and she said "Would you like to
meet one of the Rockefellers?"


1661
1:47:48,765 --> 1:47:50,739
And I said "Sure, I'd love to."


1662
1:47:50,739 --> 1:47:53,739
And we became friends


1663
1:47:53,739 --> 1:47:56,61
and he began to divulge
a lot of things to me


1664
1:47:56,61 --> 1:47:58,797
so he said to me one night:


1665
1:47:58,797 --> 1:48:2,155
"There's going to be an event,
Aaron, and out of that event


1666
1:48:2,155 --> 1:48:4,711
you're going to see, we're
going to go into Afghanistan


1667
1:48:4,711 --> 1:48:8,754
so we can run pipelines from the Caspian Sea.
We are going to go into Iraq


1668
1:48:8,754 --> 1:48:11,432
to take the oil and establish
a base in the Middle East


1669
1:48:11,432 --> 1:48:15,525
and we are going to go into
Venezuela and get rid of Chavez."


1670
1:48:15,525 --> 1:48:19,541
The first two they have accomplished,
Chavez they didn't accomplish.


1671
1:48:19,541 --> 1:48:23,216
And he said "You are going
to see guys going into caves


1672
1:48:23,216 --> 1:48:27,55
looking for people they are
never going to find. "


1673
1:48:27,55 --> 1:48:31,175
He was laughing about the fact
that you have this war on terror


1674
1:48:31,175 --> 1:48:33,724
and there is no real enemy,
he was talking about


1675
1:48:33,724 --> 1:48:36,929
how by having this war on
terror you can never win it


1676
1:48:36,929 --> 1:48:39,61
because it is an eternal war.


1677
1:48:39,61 --> 1:48:42,732
So you can always keep taking
peoples liberties away.


1678
1:48:42,732 --> 1:48:46,279
And I said "How are you going to
convince people that this war is real?"


1679
1:48:46,279 --> 1:48:49,413
And he said "By the media, which can
convince everybody that it's real. "


1680
1:48:49,413 --> 1:48:53,672
You just keep talking about things, you
keep saying them over and over again


1681
1:48:53,672 --> 1:48:55,687
and eventually
people believe it.


1682
1:48:55,687 --> 1:48:59,503
You created the Federal
Reserve in 1913 through lies.


1683
1:48:59,503 --> 1:49:3,1
You create 9/11, which
is another lie.


1684
1:49:3,1 --> 1:49:5,831
Through 9/11, then you are
fighting a war on terror


1685
1:49:5,831 --> 1:49:9,31
and all the sudden you go into
Iraq, which was another lie


1686
1:49:9,31 --> 1:49:11,318
and now they are
going to do Iran.


1687
1:49:11,318 --> 1:49:14,475
It's all one thing leading to
another, leading to another...


1688
1:49:14,475 --> 1:49:17,62
I would say to him "What are you doing this for?
What's the point of this thing?


1689
1:49:17,62 --> 1:49:19,759
You have all the money
you would ever want.


1690
1:49:19,759 --> 1:49:23,814
You have all the power. You're hurting people.
It's not a good thing."


1691
1:49:23,814 --> 1:49:26,67
And he would say "What do you
care about the people for?


1692
1:49:26,67 --> 1:49:29,48
Take care of yourself and
take care of your family."


1693
1:49:29,48 --> 1:49:33,14
And then I said "So what are
the ultimate goals here?"


1694
1:49:33,14 --> 1:49:36,338
He said "The ultimate goal is
to get everyone in this world


1695
1:49:36,338 --> 1:49:38,978
chipped with an RFID chip.


1696
1:49:38,978 --> 1:49:42,778
And have all money be on those chips
and everything on those chips


1697
1:49:42,778 --> 1:49:46,52
and if anybody wants to protest
what we do, or violate what we want


1698
1:49:46,52 --> 1:49:50,73
we just turn off their chip."


1699
1:49:50,73 --> 1:49:53,243
(P. Joseph)
How far will
the sickness of power go?


1700
1:49:53,243 --> 1:49:55,7
To what lengths will
those in control go


1701
1:49:55,7 --> 1:49:59,8
in order to maintain and
preserve their positions?


1702
1:49:59,8 --> 1:50:4,478
We have a Florida family who are
really pioneers in a brave new world.


1703
1:50:4,478 --> 1:50:7,432
They have volunteered
to be the first ever


1704
1:50:7,432 --> 1:50:12,154
to have microchip identification
devices implanted into their bodies.


1705
1:50:12,154 --> 1:50:19,155
After 9/11, I was really concerned
with the security of my family.


1706
1:50:19,155 --> 1:50:22,49
I wouldn't mind having something
planted permanently in my arm


1707
1:50:22,49 --> 1:50:24,924
that would identify me.


1708
1:50:24,924 --> 1:50:30,95
(P. Joseph)
George Orwell in his famed and
possibly prophetic work '1984', stated:


1709
1:50:30,95 --> 1:50:33,928
"Power is not a means,
it is an end.


1710
1:50:33,928 --> 1:50:36,498
The object of persecution
is persecution.


1711
1:50:36,498 --> 1:50:41,902
The object of torture is torture.
The object of power is power."


1712
1:50:41,902 --> 1:50:45,465
Today, symptoms of a surveillance
society continue to grow


1713
1:50:45,465 --> 1:50:48,213
as irrational fears
of invisible enemies


1714
1:50:48,213 --> 1:50:52,873
coupled with rising economic
instability spread across the globe.


1715
1:50:52,873 --> 1:50:56,57
It is under this guise of security
that we can foreshadow a world


1716
1:50:56,57 --> 1:50:59,495
where everyone is tracked,
everyone is on camera


1717
1:50:59,495 --> 1:51:3,461
and everyone is subordinated.


1718
1:51:3,461 --> 1:51:6,186
The most incredible
aspect of all:


1719
1:51:6,186 --> 1:51:9,826
Such totalitarianism would likely
not be forced upon the people.


1720
1:51:9,826 --> 1:51:12,361
Rather, the people
will demand it.


1721
1:51:12,361 --> 1:51:16,105
For the social manipulation of society
through the generation of fear


1722
1:51:16,105 --> 1:51:19,944
and division has completely
inhibited the culture.


1723
1:51:19,944 --> 1:51:24,158
Religion, patriotism,
race, wealth


1724
1:51:24,158 --> 1:51:28,576
class and every other form of
arbitrary separatist identification


1725
1:51:28,576 --> 1:51:32,669
and thus conceit has served to
create a controlled population


1726
1:51:32,669 --> 1:51:35,367
utterly malleable in
the hands of the few.


1727
1:51:35,367 --> 1:51:37,795
'Divide and Conquer'
is the motto


1728
1:51:37,795 --> 1:51:40,768
and as long as people continue
to see themselves as separate


1729
1:51:40,768 --> 1:51:46,231
from everything else, they lend
themselves to being completely enslaved.


1730
1:51:46,231 --> 1:51:50,899
However, if the people ever realized the
truth of their relationship to nature


1731
1:51:50,899 --> 1:51:54,497
and the truth of their personal
power to affect change


1732
1:51:54,497 --> 1:51:57,922
the entire manufactured
zeitgeist that's preyed upon


1733
1:51:57,922 --> 1:52:13,32
would collapse like
a house of cards.


1734
1:52:13,32 --> 1:52:16,903
(R. Alpert)
The whole
system that we live in


1735
1:52:16,903 --> 1:52:20,13
drills into us that we're
powerless, that we're weak


1736
1:52:20,13 --> 1:52:23,894
that our society is evil,
that it's crime ridden, etc.


1737
1:52:23,894 --> 1:52:26,342
It's all a big, fat lie!


1738
1:52:26,342 --> 1:52:30,454
We are powerful, beautiful,
extraordinary.


1739
1:52:30,454 --> 1:52:35,381
There is no reason why we cannot
understand who we truly are


1740
1:52:35,381 --> 1:52:39,333
where we are going.
There is no reason why the average individual


1741
1:52:39,333 --> 1:52:45,302
cannot be fully empowered, we
are incredibly powerful beings.


1742
1:52:45,302 --> 1:52:48,0
- I think I spent
30 years of my life


1743
1:52:48,0 --> 1:52:52,322
the first 30, trying to become something.
I wanted to become good at things


1744
1:52:52,322 --> 1:52:55,47
I wanted to become good at
tennis, school and grades


1745
1:52:55,47 --> 1:52:57,882
and everything I viewed
in that perspective:


1746
1:52:57,882 --> 1:53:2,99
I'm not OK the way I am, but
if I got good at things...


1747
1:53:2,99 --> 1:53:4,453
I realized that I
had the game wrong.


1748
1:53:4,453 --> 1:53:30,86
The game was to find out
what I already was.


1749
1:53:30,86 --> 1:53:32,3
(R. Albert)
Now, in our
culture we have been trained


1750
1:53:32,3 --> 1:53:34,871
for individual differences
to stand out.


1751
1:53:34,871 --> 1:53:37,253
You look at each person
and the immediate hit is:


1752
1:53:37,253 --> 1:53:40,289
brighter, dumber, older,
younger, richer, poorer


1753
1:53:40,289 --> 1:53:43,114
and we make all these
dimensional distinctions


1754
1:53:43,114 --> 1:53:45,856
put them into categories
and treat them that way.


1755
1:53:45,856 --> 1:53:49,465
And we get so that we only see
others as separate from ourselves


1756
1:53:49,465 --> 1:53:51,624
in the ways in which
they are separate.


1757
1:53:51,624 --> 1:53:56,115
And one of the dramatic
characteristics of experience


1758
1:53:56,115 --> 1:53:58,444
is being with another
person and suddenly seeing


1759
1:53:58,444 --> 1:54:2,33
the ways in which they are like
you, not different from you.


1760
1:54:2,33 --> 1:54:5,2
And experiencing the fact,
that which is essence in you


1761
1:54:5,2 --> 1:54:7,838
and which is essence
in me, is indeed one.


1762
1:54:7,838 --> 1:54:16,151
The understanding that there is no other.
It is all one.


1763
1:54:16,151 --> 1:54:19,467
I wasn't born Richard Albert, I
was just born as a human being


1764
1:54:19,467 --> 1:54:22,908
and then I learned this
whole business of who I am


1765
1:54:22,908 --> 1:54:26,21
and whether I'm good or
bad, achieving or not


1766
1:54:26,21 --> 1:54:28,79
all that's learned
along the way.


1767
1:54:28,79 --> 1:54:33,949
"When the power of love
overcomes the love of power


1768
1:54:33,949 --> 1:54:44,617
the world will know peace."
- Sri Chinmoy Ghose


1769
1:54:44,617 --> 1:54:49,619
(C. Sagan)
The old appeals to racial,
sexual and religious chauvinism


1770
1:54:49,619 --> 1:54:54,905
to rabid nationalist fervor,
are beginning not to work.


1771
1:54:54,905 --> 1:54:57,514
A new consciousness is
developing which sees the Earth


1772
1:54:57,514 --> 1:55:2,168
as a single organism
and recognizes


1773
1:55:2,168 --> 1:55:38,4
that an organism at war
with itself is doomed.


1774
1:55:38,4 --> 1:55:45,412
- Bill Hicks used to finish
his shows with this:


1775
1:55:45,412 --> 1:55:48,299
"Life's like a ride
in an amusement park


1776
1:55:48,299 --> 1:55:50,33
and when you go on it
you think it's real


1777
1:55:50,33 --> 1:55:52,988
because that's how
powerful our minds are.


1778
1:55:52,988 --> 1:55:55,404
The ride goes up and
down and round and round


1779
1:55:55,404 --> 1:55:58,538
it has thrills and chills and
it's very brightly colored.


1780
1:55:58,538 --> 1:56:1,979
And it's very loud and
it's fun for a while.


1781
1:56:1,979 --> 1:56:5,174
Some have been on the ride for a long
time and they begin to question:


1782
1:56:5,174 --> 1:56:8,598
Is this real?
Or is this just a ride?


1783
1:56:8,598 --> 1:56:11,82
And other people have remembered
and they come back to us


1784
1:56:11,82 --> 1:56:14,851
and they say: 'Hey, don't
worry, don't be afraid ever


1785
1:56:14,851 --> 1:56:18,111
because this is just a ride."


1786
1:56:18,111 --> 1:56:20,469
And we kill those people.


1787
1:56:20,469 --> 1:56:24,249
Shut him up I have got a lot
invested in this ride, shut him up!


1788
1:56:24,249 --> 1:56:26,274
Look at my furrows of worry...


1789
1:56:26,274 --> 1:56:30,811
Look at my big bank account and my family.
This has to be real.


1790
1:56:30,811 --> 1:56:34,743
It's just a ride. But we will kill those
good guys who try and tell us that.


1791
1:56:34,743 --> 1:56:38,827
Have you ever notice that?
And let the demons run amok...


1792
1:56:38,827 --> 1:56:41,672
But it doesn't matter,
because it is just a ride


1793
1:56:41,672 --> 1:56:43,947
and we can change
it anytime we want.


1794
1:56:43,947 --> 1:56:49,227
It is only a choice. No effort, no
work, no job, no savings of money.


1795
1:56:49,227 --> 1:56:51,633
Just a choice right now.


1796
1:56:51,633 --> 1:57:15,476
Between fear and love.


1797
1:57:15,476 --> 1:57:31,787
