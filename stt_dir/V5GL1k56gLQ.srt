MIKE RUBENDALL: I guess
you could say I'm


3
0:0:14,81 --> 0:0:16,6
obsessed with tattooing.


4
0:0:16,6 --> 0:0:18,77



5
0:0:18,77 --> 0:0:21,45
I feel like tattooing has
always challenged me in


6
0:0:21,45 --> 0:0:23,862
certain ways.


7
0:0:23,862 --> 0:0:27,1
I always drew my whole life,
but I never felt like I was


8
0:0:27,1 --> 0:0:28,38
gifted in any way.


9
0:0:28,38 --> 0:0:30,44
Out of hard work, I developed
this talent.


10
0:0:30,44 --> 0:0:34,254
I never had God-gifted talent.


11
0:0:34,254 --> 0:0:36,8
FRANK ROMANO: What separates
him from


12
0:0:36,8 --> 0:0:38,73
the rest of the pack--


13
0:0:38,73 --> 0:0:40,79
work ethic.


14
0:0:40,79 --> 0:0:45,1
He may not know more than you
know, but he's going to


15
0:0:45,1 --> 0:0:46,8
outwork you.


16
0:0:46,8 --> 0:0:47,97
No question about it.


17
0:0:47,97 --> 0:0:49,71
He's going to get up earlier.


18
0:0:49,71 --> 0:0:51,73
He's going to stay up later.


19
0:0:51,73 --> 0:0:54,3
And he's going to try harder.


20
0:0:54,3 --> 0:0:55,28
And he's not going to stop.


21
0:0:55,28 --> 0:0:57,66



22
0:0:57,66 --> 0:0:58,91
How do you beat that?


23
0:0:58,91 --> 0:2:58,91
