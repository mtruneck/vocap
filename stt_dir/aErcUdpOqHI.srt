1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,95
MALE SPEAKER 1: And now, the CEO
of K-Swiss, Kenny Powers.


2
0:0:2,95 --> 0:0:3,28
[APPLAUSE]


3
0:0:3,28 --> 0:0:5,8
KENNY POWERS: Woo hoo, yeah!


4
0:0:5,8 --> 0:0:6,55
Kenny fucking Powers!


5
0:0:6,55 --> 0:0:8,2
Come on, raise it up!


6
0:0:8,2 --> 0:0:8,51
Woo hoo!


7
0:0:8,51 --> 0:0:9,49
Come on!


8
0:0:9,49 --> 0:0:11,45
There you go, two at you!


9
0:0:11,45 --> 0:0:12,43
Let me hear fucking more!


10
0:0:12,43 --> 0:0:12,92
[APPLAUSE]


11
0:0:12,92 --> 0:0:13,9
KENNY POWERS: All right, cool!


12
0:0:13,9 --> 0:0:14,39
OK.


13
0:0:14,39 --> 0:0:17,82
OK, OK, shut the fuck up!


14
0:0:17,82 --> 0:0:22,48
I have a dream, a wet dream, and
today you get the pleasure


15
0:0:22,48 --> 0:0:26,92
of witnessing my dream
come true.


16
0:0:26,92 --> 0:0:29,83
The way I see it, there's three
things an athlete needs


17
0:0:29,83 --> 0:0:31,36
to succeed.


18
0:0:31,36 --> 0:0:35,78
Talent, strippers, and most
importantly, speed.


19
0:0:35,78 --> 0:0:39,64
Because speed is what takes an
athlete to the next level.


20
0:0:39,64 --> 0:0:43,7
Today, it's time to unleash my
greatest creation ever, my


21
0:0:43,7 --> 0:0:46,94
magnum fucking opus, Blades!


22
0:0:46,94 --> 0:0:50,322
[APPLAUSE]


23
0:0:50,322 --> 0:0:52,29
[MUSIC]


24
0:0:52,29 --> 0:0:54,7
KENNY POWERS: Witness and
behold the world's most


25
0:0:54,7 --> 0:0:55,95
advanced running shoe.


26
0:0:55,95 --> 0:0:57,6



27
0:0:57,6 --> 0:0:59,24
He's doing the running
man, get it?


28
0:0:59,24 --> 0:1:0,3
That's hilarious.


29
0:1:0,3 --> 0:1:1,75
Look how nimble he is.


30
0:1:1,75 --> 0:1:3,7
OK, running man, that's cool.


31
0:1:3,7 --> 0:1:3,77
You're overdoing it now.


32
0:1:3,77 --> 0:1:5,0
You're making yourself
look stupid.


33
0:1:5,0 --> 0:1:6,61
Get the fuck out of here.


34
0:1:6,61 --> 0:1:9,12
Now, let me give you a
sneak peek into the


35
0:1:9,12 --> 0:1:12,3
brilliant mind of me.


36
0:1:12,3 --> 0:1:13,43
Yo, word.


37
0:1:13,43 --> 0:1:16,12
Welcome to the K-Swiss
R and double D lab.


38
0:1:16,12 --> 0:1:19,2
Double D for development,
and also for huge tits.


39
0:1:19,2 --> 0:1:20,27
Come on in.


40
0:1:20,27 --> 0:1:26,75



41
0:1:26,75 --> 0:1:28,29
Cool science, dog.


42
0:1:28,29 --> 0:1:30,34
In order to create a shoe that
will make an athlete run


43
0:1:30,34 --> 0:1:31,95
faster than fuck, I not
only watch how fast


44
0:1:31,95 --> 0:1:32,92
this cheetah runs.


45
0:1:32,92 --> 0:1:34,4
I watch how that motherfucker
kills.


46
0:1:34,4 --> 0:1:36,62
Suck it, slow ass animal.


47
0:1:36,62 --> 0:1:37,22
What's up?


48
0:1:37,22 --> 0:1:40,0
Me and my smart as hell
scientists here have developed


49
0:1:40,0 --> 0:1:42,84
what I like to call speed
activated technology.


50
0:1:42,84 --> 0:1:45,56
Run slow and the blades will
become soft and pillowy, like


51
0:1:45,56 --> 0:1:46,56
these awesome things.


52
0:1:46,56 --> 0:1:48,895
Or, flip the fucking
turbo switch and


53
0:1:48,895 --> 0:1:50,3
blades will react quickly.


54
0:1:50,3 --> 0:1:53,2
Like a spring loaded shotgun for
your fucking feet parts.


55
0:1:53,2 --> 0:1:54,582
Nice work, dickheads.


56
0:1:54,582 --> 0:1:57,7
But next level technology like
this doesn't mean jack shit if


57
0:1:57,7 --> 0:2:0,21
it doesn't translate to peak
performance on game day.


58
0:2:0,21 --> 0:2:1,84
That's why I enlisted
the help of all pro


59
0:2:1,84 --> 0:2:2,8
linebacker Patrick Willis.


60
0:2:2,8 --> 0:2:3,34
PATRICK WILLIS: Aah!


61
0:2:3,34 --> 0:2:4,79
KENNY POWERS: See if he can run
this motherfucker through


62
0:2:4,79 --> 0:2:5,305
some tests.


63
0:2:5,305 --> 0:2:7,107
Fuck that wildebeest up!


64
0:2:7,107 --> 0:2:8,45
PATRICK WILLIS: [YELLING]


65
0:2:8,45 --> 0:2:9,295
Aah!


66
0:2:9,295 --> 0:2:12,266



67
0:2:12,266 --> 0:2:13,98
KENNY POWERS: Willis, that
is fucking bad ass!


68
0:2:13,98 --> 0:2:15,6
That is how I invented Blades.


69
0:2:15,6 --> 0:2:16,236
[APPLAUSE]


70
0:2:16,236 --> 0:2:18,32
KENNY POWERS: As for the name,
I got to give credit where


71
0:2:18,32 --> 0:2:19,39
credit is due.


72
0:2:19,39 --> 0:2:24,346
To a Chinese man by
the name of Bruce.


73
0:2:24,346 --> 0:2:25,85
Ni Hao, player.


74
0:2:25,85 --> 0:2:27,37
You're fucking blown
up these days.


75
0:2:27,37 --> 0:2:29,1
You got like a bagillion
Facebook fans.


76
0:2:29,1 --> 0:2:30,25
BRUCE LEE: Definitely,
definitely.


77
0:2:30,25 --> 0:2:30,52
[LAUGHING]


78
0:2:30,52 --> 0:2:31,72
KENNY POWERS: Whoa, whoa.


79
0:2:31,72 --> 0:2:33,1
Don't get cocky on me
there kimosabe.


80
0:2:33,1 --> 0:2:34,45
BRUCE LEE: I meant that
as a joke, of course.


81
0:2:34,45 --> 0:2:34,85
[LAUGHTER]


82
0:2:34,85 --> 0:2:36,84
KENNY POWERS: All right,
time for serious.


83
0:2:36,84 --> 0:2:38,615
Remember that time when me and
you were fucking around in


84
0:2:38,615 --> 0:2:40,41
your dojo playing with swords
and shit and those derelicts


85
0:2:40,41 --> 0:2:41,56
tried to step to us?


86
0:2:41,56 --> 0:2:42,335
BRUCE LEE: Violence man.


87
0:2:42,335 --> 0:2:42,47
[LAUGHTER]


88
0:2:42,47 --> 0:2:43,87
KENNY POWERS: Oh yeah,
that was violence.


89
0:2:43,87 --> 0:2:45,91
Well while you were busy tearing
them a new asshole, I


90
0:2:45,91 --> 0:2:46,96
saw something.


91
0:2:46,96 --> 0:2:48,8
You see these motherfuckers?


92
0:2:48,8 --> 0:2:50,78
These little scratches on your
titties, they were the


93
0:2:50,78 --> 0:2:52,49
inspiration for the
name Blades.


94
0:2:52,49 --> 0:2:54,38
BRUCE LEE: And it's a
heck of a name, man.


95
0:2:54,38 --> 0:2:54,87
KENNY POWERS: Yeah, no shit.


96
0:2:54,87 --> 0:2:55,66
I came up with it.


97
0:2:55,66 --> 0:2:59,9
BRUCE LEE: All type of knowledge
ultimately means


98
0:2:59,9 --> 0:3:2,0
self knowledge.


99
0:3:2,0 --> 0:3:5,9
Now you put water into a cup,
it becomes the cup--.


100
0:3:5,9 --> 0:3:7,42
KENNY POWERS: OK,
how about this?


101
0:3:7,42 --> 0:3:9,35
How about instead of doing all
this poetry shit, we just go


102
0:3:9,35 --> 0:3:11,37
fuck some dudes up with
this blade, huh?


103
0:3:11,37 --> 0:3:12,819
BRUCE LEE: [LAUGHTER]


104
0:3:12,819 --> 0:3:13,785
KENNY POWERS: [LAUGHTER]


105
0:3:13,785 --> 0:3:15,234
Woo!


106
0:3:15,234 --> 0:3:15,717
[APPLAUSE]


107
0:3:15,717 --> 0:3:17,56
KENNY POWERS: Yep,
that was me.


108
0:3:17,56 --> 0:3:19,38
That exchange was
completely real.


109
0:3:19,38 --> 0:3:21,65
But all this blood, sweat, and
innovation doesn't mean a


110
0:3:21,65 --> 0:3:25,31
goddamn thing if we don't
get feet in the shoes.


111
0:3:25,31 --> 0:3:27,22
So we're making Saturday
morning commercials


112
0:3:27,22 --> 0:3:29,85
specifically for the soft little
minds of children.


113
0:3:29,85 --> 0:3:31,695
Let's get these kids fucking
hooked on speed!


114
0:3:31,695 --> 0:3:35,25



115
0:3:35,25 --> 0:3:37,53
All right ladies, let's see
what these blades can do.


116
0:3:37,53 --> 0:3:40,862



117
0:3:40,862 --> 0:3:42,766
Fuck yeah, Blades!


118
0:3:42,766 --> 0:3:43,718
Woo!


119
0:3:43,718 --> 0:3:44,194
Speed!


120
0:3:44,194 --> 0:3:45,91
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!


121
0:3:45,91 --> 0:3:47,842
You just shit your pants, nerd.


122
0:3:47,842 --> 0:3:48,316
Blades!


123
0:3:48,316 --> 0:3:49,566
Woo!


124
0:3:49,566 --> 0:3:51,79



125
0:3:51,79 --> 0:3:54,9
Aw shit, evil dude.


126
0:3:54,9 --> 0:3:55,34
Run fast or die, hombre.


127
0:3:55,34 --> 0:3:57,804



128
0:3:57,804 --> 0:3:58,275
Speed!


129
0:3:58,275 --> 0:3:59,69
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!


130
0:3:59,69 --> 0:4:0,94
Speed!


131
0:4:0,94 --> 0:4:3,322



132
0:4:3,322 --> 0:4:6,36
Take that, fuckers!


133
0:4:6,36 --> 0:4:7,975
Blades, go buy them.


134
0:4:7,975 --> 0:4:11,266
[APPLAUSE]


135
0:4:11,266 --> 0:4:16,176
[MUSIC]


136
0:4:16,176 --> 0:4:21,89
[ASTRONAUT BREATHING]


137
0:4:21,89 --> 0:4:23,215
KENNY POWERS: Walking on the--


138
0:4:23,215 --> 0:4:25,7
fuck.


139
0:4:25,7 --> 0:4:29,41
Walking on the moon was the
greatest thing that man had


140
0:4:29,41 --> 0:4:32,7
ever done, until now.


141
0:4:32,7 --> 0:4:34,61
I've basically taken all the
fastest shit I've ever seen--


142
0:4:34,61 --> 0:4:37,63
bionic missiles, fucking
Bruce Lee, cheetahs--


143
0:4:37,63 --> 0:4:41,14
and I've combined them together
to make the best shoe


144
0:4:41,14 --> 0:4:43,34
you've ever seen.


145
0:4:43,34 --> 0:4:44,21
You may applaud now.


146
0:4:44,21 --> 0:4:45,498
[APPLAUSE]


147
0:4:45,498 --> 0:4:50,188
KENNY POWERS: Oh yeah, water on
the moon feels just right.


148
0:4:50,188 --> 0:4:53,47
What do you ladies say we
take a trip to Uranus?


149
0:4:53,47 --> 0:4:53,81
You get it?


150
0:4:53,81 --> 0:4:55,6
MALE SPEAKER 2: Blades.


151
0:4:55,6 --> 0:6:55,6
