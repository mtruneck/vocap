0:0:0,32 --> 0:0:5,71
Tibet matters because it represents a wisdom
tradition 2,500 years old.


2
0:0:5,71 --> 0:0:10,99
Tibet matters because it is one example in
history of a warrior nation


3
0:0:10,99 --> 0:0:15,9
that deliberately and quite consciously became
a devotional culture of peace.


4
0:0:15,9 --> 0:0:19,7
I made a film once called "The Science of
The Mind" about Tibetan Buddhism


5
0:0:19,7 --> 0:0:21,539
and you may wonder why did we use the word
"science"


6
0:0:21,539 --> 0:0:25,39
to describe what you might think of as a purely
religious tradition.


7
0:0:25,39 --> 0:0:29,8
But, what is science but the empirical pursuit
of the truth?


8
0:0:29,8 --> 0:0:30,39
What is Tibetan Buddhism,


9
0:0:30,39 --> 0:0:35,96
but 2,500 years of direct observation as to
the nature of mind.


10
0:0:35,96 --> 0:0:38,2
Tibet matters because it represents


11
0:0:38,2 --> 0:0:43,219
one of the greatest living theological, devotional
philosophies and traditions


12
0:0:43,219 --> 0:2:43,219
that can inspire all of us to live lives of
love and compassion.
