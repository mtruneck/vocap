###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: We have a lot of ground to cover today. Asia, Australia, the Middle
###7 East, North America - even what could be the edge of the solar system. Let`s go.

###17 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Today I want to make it absolutely
###27 clear to Assad and those under his command, the world is watching. The use of chemical
###34 weapons is and would be totally unacceptable.
###39 And if you make the tragic mistake of using these weapons, there will be consequences.
###46 And you will be held accountable.
###47 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###48 AZUZ: That was President Obama on Monday talking about Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. There
###53 are concerns that al-Assad`s government forces might use chemical weapons, like poison gas
###58 in its fight against rebels in Syria`s ongoing civil war. Syrian officials say the government
###64 doesn`t have any plans to use those kinds of weapons. The fighting in Syria, though,
###68 is not letting up. You can see some of the damage here in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
###73 Reports say more than 42,000 Syrians have been killed since the civil war started 21
###78 months ago.
###79 This picture was taken from the international space station. The giant white spiral, that`s
###84 a typhoon, it`s the same kind of storm as a hurricane. This one is called Bopha, and
###89 it`s huge. At one point on Monday it was a super typhoon, the same size and speed as
###95 a category five hurricane. Yesterday, it hit the Philippines. This is some of what it left
###101 behind: massive flooding, landslides, homes destroyed, more than two dozen people were
###106 killed and more than 50,000 have been affected by the typhoon. A lot of the communities in
###111 Bopha`s path weren`t prepared for it before the typhoon hit. Government agencies tried
###115 to get people out of the way and to get relief supplies and emergency crews in place to help
###120 out afterward.
###120 Less than four weeks to go, and still, no deal in D.C. Yes, we are talking about the
###126 fiscal cliff, the series of automatic government spending cuts and tax increases that will
###131 take place on January First, if President Obama and Congress can`t agree on ways to
###136 cut the nation`s debt.
###138 We don`t have a deal, we do have a proposal. Two of them, in fact. President Obama offered
###144 his plan last week, Republican leaders rejected it. Republicans offered a counter plan this
###149 week. The president rejected it. There are some ideas that both sides agree on, but the
###154 two big sticking points are government spending and tax rates for Americans who make more
###159 than $250,000 a year. So, right now we have proposals, but no agreement.

###165 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to coach Christinsen`s social studies
###169 classes at Maize South High School in Wichita, Kansas.
###173 "Which of these was launched into space first? Here we go. Was it the Curiosity Rover, International
###181 Space Station, Voyager I spacecraft of space shuttle Discovery. You`ve got three seconds,
###190 go!
###192 Voyager One was first taking off on September Fifth, 1977. That`s your answer and that`s
###201 your "Shoutout."
###202 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###204 AZUZ: A 35-year road trip, and it`s not going to be over any time soon. Voyager I is getting
###210 ready to leave the Solar System? Or maybe, let`s go back to start. When it launched in
###215 1977 few people could have imagined that Voyager might tell us more about our Solar System
###220 than any other spacecraft. The main mission was to explore Jupiter and Saturn. It did
###225 that. And NASA decided to just let the thing keep on going. Past the other planets, heading
###230 toward interstellar space. That means out of our Solar System. NASA officials thought
###236 it was almost at the border, but than on Monday when it was about 11 billion miles from the
###241 Sun, Voyager sent back some surprising news. Sorry, all, it turns out the Solar System
###246 is bigger than we thought. Voyager has traveled farther in the space than any other man-made
###251 object, but it`s going to have to keep on going to bust out of the Solar System. NASA`s
###256 new prediction is that it could happen in the few months or a couple of years.
###261 Imagine the life of a presidential nominee: for months of campaigning, TV cameras follow
###266 your every move. There are these giant cheering crowds everywhere you go. And then you get
###271 to election night, and if you end up on the short hand of the electoral college count,
###275 everything stops. What is it like to lose the presidential election and what do you
###280 do after that? Lisa Sylvester takes a look.

###283 LISA SYLVESTER, CBS CORRESPONDENT: They are a hair away from the highest office of the
###286 land.
###286 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The next president of the United States of America Mitt Romney!
###293 SYLVESTER: Then suddenly, it`s over. Mitt Romney joins the list of the almost but not
###296 quite, along with Senator John McCain, Senator John Kerry, former Vice President Al Gore,
###303 former Governor Michael Dukakis, and former Senator Bob Dole.
###306 DOUGLAS BRINKLEY, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: In Great Britain, if somebody like Mitt Romney,
###309 you know, after they lost, they would be able to go in the House of Lords, kind of a wise
###313 men council. We don`t have it in the United States. When you lose, you lose.
###317 SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R ), ARIZONA: That alone.
###318 SYLVESTER: Reinvention can take different forms. Senators McCain and Kerry have their
###322 day jobs to return to on Capitol Hill. In fact, Kerry`s name is now being floated for
###327 secretary of state replacing Hillary Clinton.
###330 Vice President Al Gore made global warming his calling, winning the 2007 Nobel Peace
###336 Prize, Gore also promoted sustainable investing and co- founded current TV. Bob Dole has been
###342 a special council at a top law firm.
###346 Moving from the political life back to civilian life can be tricky. Take Mitt Romney, he had
###352 round the clock secret service protection, a legion of followers.
###355 (applause)
###357 SYLVESTER: Crowds of thousands chanting his name. And then, nothing.
###364 Former congressman Mark Kennedy who now heads up George Washington University`s Graduate
###368 School of Political Management offers this sage advice:
###371 MARK KENNEDY, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: I think what makes a difference is having a focus:
###375 you mentioned Al Gore. He focused on environmental issues. If you look at John Kerry who`s focuses
###379 on foreign policy issues. If you pick some piece of your message that did resonate with
###384 the American people and after a pause come back and start emphasizing that in important
###390 ways, that I think is the path to really helping to make a difference after you run.

###397 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me.
###400 I`m a geographic landmark that`s also a popular tourist attraction. I`m home to thousands
###407 of different species. I`m located off the coast of Australia and I`m the world`s largest
###412 coral reef system.
###416 I`m the Great Barrier Reef. And I cover around a 135,000 square miles.
###424 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###427 AZUZ: One group is trying to map out every inch of the Great Barrier Reef, and they are
###431 posting the pictures online. Sure, it`s a way for people who can`t visit in person to
###435 see the world`s largest coral reef, but the point of this project isn`t just for people
###439 to see the reef, is to help keep it from disappearing. Philippe Cousteau dives into the details.

###445 PHILIPPE COUSTEAU: We are in the water with the researchers of the Catlin Seaview Survey.
###450 Their mission map the world`s coral reefs creating a comprehensive study for scientists
###456 while giving the rest of us a chance to see their work in real time.
###460 360 degree panoramic images that will soon be used by researchers monitoring the effects
###468 of climate change are already available on Google maps. And a social media campaign connects
###474 the team with more than 2 million followers online.
###479 Coral reefs are source of food and income for over 500 million people in more than 50
###486 countries. But for most of us, they remain out of sight and out of mind. And the neglect
###493 is taking its toll. Overfishing, pollution, warming ocean temperatures have all contributed
###500 to what scientists are discovering is the reefs` rapid decline.
###504 OVE HOEGH-GULDBERG, CHIEF SCIENTIST: We had a paper published on it at the (inaudible)
###509 Sciences that shows that half of the coral in the Great Barrier Reef has disappeared
###512 over the last 27 years. That`s a momentous change. And if continue on that pathway, the
###518 Great Barrier Reef will largely not have coral on it.
###521 COUSTEAU: The Catlin team says waiting to share results simply is not an option. The
###526 future health of the reefs needs to be understood now and not just by researchers.
###531 RICHARD VEVERS, PROJECT DIRECTOR: There is amazing scientific work being done, but it`s
###536 being read by up to sort of 100 people around the world. And we wanted to bridge this gap,
###543 well, we need to bridge this gap between scientific awareness and public understanding.
###549 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###550 AZUZ: Before we go, dogs like to splash around in water. But this guy might want to rethink
###556 his choice of play pals. That is a killer whale. The close encounter in this Youtube
###561 video happened in New Zealand. Luckily, the dog did get to safety in time, although turning
###566 around and barking back at the whale might not have been the best decision. We`d say
###570 the whale should pick on someone its own size, but that doesn`t leave many options. Maybe
###574 the thing he was just lonely and just wanted some company. When the dog swam away, the
###579 massive mammal was just this blubbering mess. It brings us to the finish line for today,
###583 but we whale be back tomorrow with more CNN STUDENT NEWS. See you then.
