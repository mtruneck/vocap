what happens.

When you pour it in like
this, you get more.


72
0:1:59,4 --> 0:2:1,34
And you get a little
bit more here.


73
0:2:1,34 --> 0:2:3,25
And then you pour these
two in like this,


74
0:2:3,25 --> 0:2:6,54
and watch what happens.


75
0:2:6,54 --> 0:2:8,99
Ta-da!


76
0:2:8,99 --> 0:2:10,63
Well, it's a pretty
easy thing to do.


77
0:2:10,63 --> 0:2:14,38
This is a classic science trick
called "wine water." So


78
0:2:14,38 --> 0:2:17,13
if you see it in the old
chemistry books, it was a


79
0:2:17,13 --> 0:2:20,6
reaction called "wine water." In
today's day and age, you'd


80
0:2:20,6 --> 0:2:21,36
probably call it,
I don't know.


81
0:2:21,36 --> 0:2:22,54
Kool-Aid water?


82
0:2:22,54 --> 0:2:24,38
You don't drink it in the first
place, so who knows what


83
0:2:24,38 --> 0:2:25,65
to call it.


84
0:2:25,65 --> 0:2:27,79
All I can tell you is it's a
cool color change, and it's an


85
0:2:27,79 --> 0:2:29,39
acid base kind of indicator.


86
0:2:29,39 --> 0:2:32,78
So, here's what you have to
start with-- four cups and a


87
0:2:32,78 --> 0:2:33,79
container of water.


88
0:2:33,79 --> 0:2:34,86
That's all I have.


89
0:2:34,86 --> 0:2:37,52
And what we're actually doing is
we're causing it to change


90
0:2:37,52 --> 0:2:39,44
color depending on
if something is


91
0:2:39,44 --> 0:2:40,65
an acid or a base.


92
0:2:40,65 --> 0:2:43,2
So you know what pH paper
is, it changes color.


93
0:2:43,2 --> 0:2:46,52
Well, we're using a chemical
here called phenolphthalein.


94
0:2:46,52 --> 0:2:48,94
Phenolphthalein is an indicator
that changes color


95
0:2:48,94 --> 0:2:51,6
if a base is present.


96
0:2:51,6 --> 0:2:54,8
And the base that we're going
to use is ammonia.


97
0:2:54,8 --> 0:2:56,52
So whenever those two come in
contact with one another, you


98
0:2:56,52 --> 0:2:58,34
get that characteristic
pink color.


99
0:2:58,34 --> 0:2:59,8
So here's what we're gonna do.


100
0:2:59,8 --> 0:3:2,5
The first thing is we're gonna
put a small amount of the


101
0:3:2,5 --> 0:3:3,72
indicator in each
one of these.


102
0:3:3,72 --> 0:3:5,48
So that's in the first
and the third cup.


103
0:3:5,48 --> 0:3:7,0
Those are the ones that I
want to change color.


104
0:3:7,0 --> 0:3:9,14
Now, we take a little of the
ammonia, and you put the


105
0:3:9,14 --> 0:3:10,29
ammonia in over here.


106
0:3:10,29 --> 0:3:13,5
So ammonia is a weak base.


107
0:3:13,5 --> 0:3:15,7
So this works very
well over here.


108
0:3:15,7 --> 0:3:17,2
So now, we're ready to go.


109
0:3:17,2 --> 0:3:19,47
We had this color change at the
very end where everything


110
0:3:19,47 --> 0:3:20,72
went colorless.


111
0:3:20,72 --> 0:3:23,25
And so that means that
I had to put


112
0:3:23,25 --> 0:3:24,42
something else in there.


113
0:3:24,42 --> 0:3:25,84
And that's where the
vinegar comes in.


114
0:3:25,84 --> 0:3:31,55
So, in the last cups here, the
second and the fourth cup, a


115
0:3:31,55 --> 0:3:32,84
small amount of vinegar.


116
0:3:32,84 --> 0:3:35,5
Nobody will see a color change
at all, but it's everything


117
0:3:35,5 --> 0:3:36,55
that we need.


118
0:3:36,55 --> 0:3:37,7
Perfect.


119
0:3:37,7 --> 0:3:38,46
To color it back.


120
0:3:38,46 --> 0:3:40,32
All right, quick aside.


121
0:3:40,32 --> 0:3:43,15
Phenolphthalein is this
indicator, and if you befriend


122
0:3:43,15 --> 0:3:45,65
a high school chemistry teacher,
he or she may have


123
0:3:45,65 --> 0:3:47,87
some phenolphthalein to
be able to do it.


124
0:3:47,87 --> 0:3:50,0
Instead of getting it from a
chemical supply company, a


125
0:3:50,0 --> 0:3:53,61
long time ago people used to
take Ex-Lax and grind some


126
0:3:53,61 --> 0:3:56,61
Ex-Lax up and add a little bit
of rubbing alcohol, and it's


127
0:3:56,61 --> 0:3:59,33
because Ex-Lax contained
phenolphthalein.


128
0:3:59,33 --> 0:4:1,56
That's not the case anymore,
so if you see stuff online


129
0:4:1,56 --> 0:4:3,91
that says use phenolphthalein,
just realize that they don't


130
0:4:3,91 --> 0:4:5,74
use the phenolphthalein
anymore.


131
0:4:5,74 --> 0:4:6,96
You're gonna have to
befriend that high


132
0:4:6,96 --> 0:4:8,62
school chemistry teacher.

134
0:4:9,57 --> 0:4:10,8
It's show time.


135
0:4:10,8 --> 0:4:13,82
So, you start with the
colorless, right, because


136
0:4:13,82 --> 0:4:14,81
clear is not a color.


137
0:4:14,81 --> 0:4:17,41
The colorless water here,
and the four cups.


138
0:4:17,41 --> 0:4:19,13
Nobody will ever notice
what's inside.


139
0:4:19,13 --> 0:4:21,79
Make sure they know there's not
food coloring, otherwise


140
0:4:21,79 --> 0:4:22,28
it's not amazing to them.


141
0:4:22,28 --> 0:4:25,64
So you say, whenever I
pour with this hand.


142
0:4:25,64 --> 0:4:27,63
Whenever you see that color,
you know that it's


143
0:4:27,63 --> 0:4:28,62
phenolphthalein.


144
0:4:28,62 --> 0:4:30,44
Switch hands, of course
for the story.


145
0:4:30,44 --> 0:4:32,41
Nothing happens here, because
all that's in there is a


146
0:4:32,41 --> 0:4:33,75
little bit of that vinegar.


147
0:4:33,75 --> 0:4:37,3
So when we pour this again, this
has the phenolphthalein.


148
0:4:37,3 --> 0:4:38,13
Nice.


149
0:4:38,13 --> 0:4:39,95
And this one pours in here.


150
0:4:39,95 --> 0:4:41,74
That's great.


151
0:4:41,74 --> 0:4:43,17
And you're done.


152
0:4:43,17 --> 0:4:45,24
Now, you can do it
a different way.


153
0:4:45,24 --> 0:4:47,58
You can have it change back
instantly and so I kind of


154
0:4:47,58 --> 0:4:50,86
like this, to start with the
clear ones, to pour these in


155
0:4:50,86 --> 0:4:52,65
the colorless ones.


156
0:4:52,65 --> 0:4:53,32
Nice.


157
0:4:53,32 --> 0:4:56,11
And now watch what happens when
you pour these two in.


158
0:4:56,11 --> 0:4:57,36
It looks very cool.


159
0:4:57,36 --> 0:5:0,324



160
0:5:0,324 --> 0:5:3,5

to end the trick.

0:5:3,5 --> 0:5:5,43
Why that's a cool science
magic trick?


162
0:5:5,43 --> 0:5:8,4
A lot of kids have seen that
before because of a high


163
0:5:8,4 --> 0:5:10,7
school chemistry class, and
it's an instant kind of


164
0:5:10,7 --> 0:5:12,95

leads us to this.

0:5:13,84 --> 0:5:14,97

167
0:5:14,97 --> 0:5:18,93

they remain colorless.

And it's just chemistry.


176

me how to do this years


177

ago, my dad.


178

I grew up in this family of
professional magicians, and I


179

think that it's probably a good
opportunity for us to go

see what the little Steve

whole thing started for me.

My mom and dad had regular
jobs, but they

0:5:56,8 --> 0:5:57,87
also did some magic.

don't know, drinking coffee

kind of a normal house and

0:6:12,432 --> 0:6:15,204
well, it's kind of normal.

routines and shows.

Mom, dad!


209
0:6:54,242 --> 0:6:56,702
[SIGHS]


210
0:6:56,702 --> 0:7:0,16



211
0:7:0,16 --> 0:7:2,24
This used to be my room.


212
0:7:2,24 --> 0:7:4,62
And now there's magic tricks.


213
0:7:4,62 --> 0:7:5,92
When did you guys move
out the furniture?


214
0:7:5,92 --> 0:7:7,412
BRUCE: What was your
name again?


215
0:7:7,412 --> 0:7:8,64
STEVE SPANGLER: Seriously,
when did you


216
0:7:8,64 --> 0:7:9,64
move out the furniture?


217
0:7:9,64 --> 0:7:11,7
This is uh--


218
0:7:11,7 --> 0:7:13,13
when I left, there were some
pretty cool magic tricks in


219
0:7:13,13 --> 0:7:14,76
the house, but this
is a little bit


220
0:7:14,76 --> 0:7:16,11
bigger than when I left.


221
0:7:16,11 --> 0:7:18,38
BRUCE: It was about 15 or 20
minutes we didn't know what we


222
0:7:18,38 --> 0:7:20,44
were going to do with this room,
but this is the way it


223
0:7:20,44 --> 0:7:20,83
turned out.


224
0:7:20,83 --> 0:7:21,45
What do you think?


225
0:7:21,45 --> 0:7:24,14
STEVE SPANGLER: Uh, I think
this has become


226
0:7:24,14 --> 0:7:25,88
bigger than an obsession.


227
0:7:25,88 --> 0:7:26,897
This is a--


228
0:7:26,897 --> 0:7:28,15
KITTY: A disease.


229
0:7:28,15 --> 0:7:29,35
STEVE SPANGLER: It
is a disease.


230
0:7:29,35 --> 0:7:31,65
BRUCE: We used to think it was
a collection, and then Kitty


231
0:7:31,65 --> 0:7:34,46
pointed out that collectors
collect antiques


232
0:7:34,46 --> 0:7:36,74
or red things or--


233
0:7:36,74 --> 0:7:38,16
we are accumulators.


234
0:7:38,16 --> 0:7:39,71
We just accumulate stuff.


235
0:7:39,71 --> 0:7:41,405
STEVE SPANGLER: It's
called hoarding.


236
0:7:41,405 --> 0:7:42,66
BRUCE: What was that
word again?


237
0:7:42,66 --> 0:7:45,37
STEVE SPANGLER: Nothing, it was
called, I am excited to be


238
0:7:45,37 --> 0:7:46,43
able to say--


239
0:7:46,43 --> 0:7:46,99
oh my gosh.


240
0:7:46,99 --> 0:7:49,25
All right, when did you
start collecting?


241
0:7:49,25 --> 0:7:50,925
Because you started doing
magic when you were--


242
0:7:50,925 --> 0:7:52,45
BRUCE: Five.


243
0:7:52,45 --> 0:7:52,55
STEVE SPANGLER: Five?


244
0:7:52,55 --> 0:7:54,46
BRUCE: Still have my
first magic set.


245
0:7:54,46 --> 0:7:56,21
STEVE SPANGLER: And so then
what happened from there?


246
0:7:56,21 --> 0:7:57,99
So you started doing magic.


247
0:7:57,99 --> 0:8:0,72
And then how do you feed this?


248
0:8:0,72 --> 0:8:3,135
BRUCE: Well, I found a
magic shop downtown.


249
0:8:3,135 --> 0:8:6,21
A lot of kids usually find their
way to a magic shop.


250
0:8:6,21 --> 0:8:8,87
And on Saturdays, we went down
and the kids would all gather


251
0:8:8,87 --> 0:8:10,89
in the basement, where we had
a little stage set up, and


252
0:8:10,89 --> 0:8:12,69
we'd do tricks for each other.


253
0:8:12,69 --> 0:8:14,38
That's how you learn
the magic.


254
0:8:14,38 --> 0:8:17,3
And I was fortunate enough to
have a teacher at that time


255
0:8:17,3 --> 0:8:20,6
who believed you never sold
your magic tricks.


256
0:8:20,6 --> 0:8:22,63
We'd always want to sell a silk
handkerchief in order to


257
0:8:22,63 --> 0:8:25,75
buy a little production box,
and he said, no, you don't


258
0:8:25,75 --> 0:8:26,13
sell those.


259
0:8:26,13 --> 0:8:26,79
Those are your kids.


260
0:8:26,79 --> 0:8:29,24
Someday you're gonna need
everything you ever bought.


261
0:8:29,24 --> 0:8:31,23
Well, this is some day.


262
0:8:31,23 --> 0:8:32,25
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah, this is.


263
0:8:32,25 --> 0:8:34,49
Yeah, this is some day.


264
0:8:34,49 --> 0:8:35,909
This is true.


265
0:8:35,909 --> 0:8:37,25
BRUCE: These are all my
friends, you know.


266
0:8:37,25 --> 0:8:39,25
STEVE SPANGLER: So,
how do magicians


267
0:8:39,25 --> 0:8:40,86
pass down their equipment?


268
0:8:40,86 --> 0:8:44,3
You didn't go to a magic shop
and buy all of this stuff, so


269
0:8:44,3 --> 0:8:45,59
what is this a representation
of?


270
0:8:45,59 --> 0:8:46,76
BRUCE: We have to
kill them off.


271
0:8:46,76 --> 0:8:48,87
When they get to a certain
age, we arrange


272
0:8:48,87 --> 0:8:50,85
to have them disappear.


273
0:8:50,85 --> 0:8:51,17
STEVE SPANGLER: OK, please
cut that from


274
0:8:51,17 --> 0:8:52,34
the record, all right?


275
0:8:52,34 --> 0:8:54,64
Next.


276
0:8:54,64 --> 0:8:57,41
Dad, where did you get these
cool magic tricks?


277
0:8:57,41 --> 0:9:0,215
BRUCE: Well, we inherit them
from deceased magi.


278
0:9:0,215 --> 0:9:1,35
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.


279
0:9:1,35 --> 0:9:4,24
Which means that a magician
dies, and the kids are looking


280
0:9:4,24 --> 0:9:5,83
at it, going, what do
I do with this crap?


281
0:9:5,83 --> 0:9:10,59
BRUCE: That's right, and we say,
we like crap. and so we


282
0:9:10,59 --> 0:9:13,23
agreed to keep them together
as collections of


283
0:9:13,23 --> 0:9:15,2
their former magician.


284
0:9:15,2 --> 0:9:18,16
And so that's what you see here,
collections that belong


285
0:9:18,16 --> 0:9:19,7
to other magicians.


286
0:9:19,7 --> 0:9:22,41
STEVE SPANGLER: So what I'm
noticing is that there are


287
0:9:22,41 --> 0:9:25,2
things on the shelf now that are
collections, and there's a


288
0:9:25,2 --> 0:9:28,85
person's name next to
each one of these.


289
0:9:28,85 --> 0:9:30,56
How do you put all the
stuff together?


290
0:9:30,56 --> 0:9:33,78
BRUCE: In some cases, we had
an agreement with a former


291
0:9:33,78 --> 0:9:35,7
owner's wife or husband,
that we would keep


292
0:9:35,7 --> 0:9:37,29
their collection together.


293
0:9:37,29 --> 0:9:39,2
And so that's how this
collection is organized.


294
0:9:39,2 --> 0:9:41,0
And it's unique in
that manner.


295
0:9:41,0 --> 0:9:44,46
We don't think that there are
any other collections that are


296
0:9:44,46 --> 0:9:46,61
maintained as collections
belonging


297
0:9:46,61 --> 0:9:48,14
to a previous magician.


298
0:9:48,14 --> 0:9:50,75
So you'll see lots of magic
wands because each magician


299
0:9:50,75 --> 0:9:52,6
had his own magic wand.


300
0:9:52,6 --> 0:9:54,99
You'll see lots of linking
rings, because every magician


301
0:9:54,99 --> 0:9:57,11
has his favorite set
of linking rings.


302
0:9:57,11 --> 0:9:59,1
And so that's what they are.


303
0:9:59,1 --> 0:10:0,69
They're really preserved
as memories


304
0:10:0,69 --> 0:10:2,1
of the former performer.


305
0:10:2,1 --> 0:10:5,81
Virtually everything you see on
all of these shelves is not


306
0:10:5,81 --> 0:10:7,17
what it appears to be.


307
0:10:7,17 --> 0:10:10,33
You may see a drinking glass and
think, oh, that's a nice


308
0:10:10,33 --> 0:10:12,22
glass, why is it in
the collection?


309
0:10:12,22 --> 0:10:14,52
Well, it's because it's not
a common drinking glass.


310
0:10:14,52 --> 0:10:16,65
There's something very
special about it.


311
0:10:16,65 --> 0:10:20,33
It has threads, or motors, or
something that makes it


312
0:10:20,33 --> 0:10:23,815
perform a specific job,
a specific feat.


313
0:10:23,815 --> 0:10:25,48
STEVE SPANGLER: One of the
things that you taught me when


314
0:10:25,48 --> 0:10:28,43
I was a kid was that you
practice a magic trick like a


315
0:10:28,43 --> 0:10:30,95
coin vanishing, or here.


316
0:10:30,95 --> 0:10:31,77
Like a ball that
may disappear.


317
0:10:31,77 --> 0:10:34,6
And we would practice that for
hours and hours and hours.


318
0:10:34,6 --> 0:10:35,8
BRUCE: Where the heck
did that go?


319
0:10:35,8 --> 0:10:36,1
STEVE SPANGLER: Oh,
it's in my elbow.


320
0:10:36,1 --> 0:10:38,32
But you would practice these
silly things for hours and--


321
0:10:38,32 --> 0:10:38,4
[GASP]


322
0:10:38,4 --> 0:10:40,31
it's in your ear, Dad.


323
0:10:40,31 --> 0:10:41,98
I'm doing schtick.


324
0:10:41,98 --> 0:10:43,33
But you would do this--


325
0:10:43,33 --> 0:10:46,42
you would make me do this over
and over and over again until


326
0:10:46,42 --> 0:10:47,37
I got it right.


327
0:10:47,37 --> 0:10:50,195
And the only reward that you
would get is somebody to


328
0:10:50,195 --> 0:10:52,12
either say, hey, do a trick,
or somebody will give you a


329
0:10:52,12 --> 0:10:53,68
little smile and go,
that's cool.


330
0:10:53,68 --> 0:10:56,14
But it's not like you're
trading this for money


331
0:10:56,14 --> 0:11:0,32
necessarily, unless you're in
a big Vegas kind of thing.


332
0:11:0,32 --> 0:11:1,54
Is that art still around?


333
0:11:1,54 --> 0:11:3,155
Do you still see that dedication
with the kids that


334
0:11:3,155 --> 0:11:3,98
are coming up today?


335
0:11:3,98 --> 0:11:6,22
BRUCE: It's still a personal
challenge, and we have the


336
0:11:6,22 --> 0:11:9,13
belief that nothing ever really
is good until you can


337
0:11:9,13 --> 0:11:10,84
do it without thinking
about it.


338
0:11:10,84 --> 0:11:14,3
That's why you see magicians
doing the slight of hand and


339
0:11:14,3 --> 0:11:16,46
working with a deck
of cards or coins.


340
0:11:16,46 --> 0:11:19,18
They're doing it over and over
and over to teach their brain


341
0:11:19,18 --> 0:11:21,32
how to do when they're
doing something else.


342
0:11:21,32 --> 0:11:23,48
When they're worried about, are
the lights right, or is


343
0:11:23,48 --> 0:11:26,69
the music gonna start on time,
or is the stage crew going to


344
0:11:26,69 --> 0:11:28,71
take something off when
they're supposed to.


345
0:11:28,71 --> 0:11:29,62
So that's what they're doing.


346
0:11:29,62 --> 0:11:32,26
They're practicing and teaching
that brain to do it


347
0:11:32,26 --> 0:11:33,64
without really thinking
about it.


348
0:11:33,64 --> 0:11:37,83
STEVE SPANGLER: I remember you
at a theater and peeking


349
0:11:37,83 --> 0:11:40,42
behind the curtain and watching
you guys perform.


350
0:11:40,42 --> 0:11:44,9
And then the very end is
you'd both eat fire.


351
0:11:44,9 --> 0:11:45,91
And when you're five years old,
and your mom and dad eat


352
0:11:45,91 --> 0:11:49,17
fire, it probably-- you win over
anybody else's parents.


353
0:11:49,17 --> 0:11:51,165
So what did you do for
show and tell?


354
0:11:51,165 --> 0:11:54,42
BRUCE: Well, it's what you did
for show and tell that got us


355
0:11:54,42 --> 0:11:55,7
into trouble.


356
0:11:55,7 --> 0:11:56,95
KITTY: You came home with
a note pinned on you.


357
0:11:56,95 --> 0:11:57,825
STEVE SPANGLER: And what
did the note say?


358
0:11:57,825 --> 0:12:0,18
BRUCE: The note said-- it was
from the principal, who said


359
0:12:0,18 --> 0:12:1,38
we need to have a meeting.


360
0:12:1,38 --> 0:12:4,27
And when we went to see the
principal of the grade school,


361
0:12:4,27 --> 0:12:8,23
he said at show and tell, your
son told us that his parents


362
0:12:8,23 --> 0:12:9,75
were fire eaters.


363
0:12:9,75 --> 0:12:11,82
And we couldn't get him
to change his mind.


364
0:12:11,82 --> 0:12:15,1
He insisted to the point of
having tears in his eyes.


365
0:12:15,1 --> 0:12:18,15
And we think that maybe he needs
some psychological help.


366
0:12:18,15 --> 0:12:19,59
STEVE SPANGLER: So how
do we cure that?


367
0:12:19,59 --> 0:12:21,54
You came to school the next
week and ate fire.


368
0:12:21,54 --> 0:12:24,28
But that's a whole
different time.


369
0:12:24,28 --> 0:12:25,16
That doesn't happen now.


370
0:12:25,16 --> 0:12:27,41
And let me tell you that the
counseling has been wonderful.


371
0:12:27,41 --> 0:12:30,2
Honestly, I've got it all
out and I'm fine now.


372
0:12:30,2 --> 0:12:31,93
BRUCE: And you know, they
rebuilt that school, and you


373
0:12:31,93 --> 0:12:33,41
can't even tell that
there was a fire.


374
0:12:33,41 --> 0:12:35,16
STEVE SPANGLER: No, and they
showed up so quickly, too.


375
0:12:35,16 --> 0:12:36,35
And who would've thought.


376
0:12:36,35 --> 0:12:39,35
Kids eating fire, and walking
on glass, or whatever else.


377
0:12:39,35 --> 0:12:43,92
But maybe the best memory that I
have is bringing kids over--


378
0:12:43,92 --> 0:12:46,6
not living in this house, but we
were in another house, and


379
0:12:46,6 --> 0:12:48,5
bringing kids over, and there
were some blenders in the


380
0:12:48,5 --> 0:12:51,14
basement because what
did you make, mom?


381
0:12:51,14 --> 0:12:53,11
KITTY: We made stage blood.


382
0:12:53,11 --> 0:12:53,91
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


383
0:12:53,91 --> 0:12:55,23
This is fake blood.


384
0:12:55,23 --> 0:12:57,17
But it isn't any fake blood.


385
0:12:57,17 --> 0:12:58,55
It's pretty special
fake blood.


386
0:12:58,55 --> 0:12:59,385
KITTY: It's the best.


387
0:12:59,385 --> 0:13:0,88
STEVE SPANGLER: Fake blood
in the whole world.


388
0:13:0,88 --> 0:13:2,69
KITTY: It was micro
encapsulated.


389
0:13:2,69 --> 0:13:6,11
So it didn't stain
your costumes.


390
0:13:6,11 --> 0:13:7,785
When it dried, you just
brush it off.


391
0:13:7,785 --> 0:13:9,26
STEVE SPANGLER: It's totally
a normal house.


392
0:13:9,26 --> 0:13:12,47
I'm telling you, this stuff
happens to everybody.


393
0:13:12,47 --> 0:13:14,1
You know what I want you to
do is show me a trick.


394
0:13:14,1 --> 0:13:16,8
So there's got to be a cool
trick that you can show me.


395
0:13:16,8 --> 0:13:17,3
Out of all these things
that are down


396
0:13:17,3 --> 0:13:17,755
here, show me a trick.


397
0:13:17,755 --> 0:13:19,64
BRUCE: You wanna see
something big time?


398
0:13:19,64 --> 0:13:20,925
STEVE SPANGLER: Huge.


399
0:13:20,925 --> 0:13:23,5
BRUCE: This is one of our
favorites back here.


400
0:13:23,5 --> 0:13:26,85
This is a mummy cabinet that's
well over 50 years.


401
0:13:26,85 --> 0:13:28,0
But you've got to help me.


402
0:13:28,0 --> 0:13:29,41
If you and Kitty will help me.


403
0:13:29,41 --> 0:13:30,5
You get that end.


404
0:13:30,5 --> 0:13:30,71
I'll get this end.


405
0:13:30,71 --> 0:13:34,15
We'll carry it outside and do
it outside, because it's too


406
0:13:34,15 --> 0:13:34,92
cramped in here.


407
0:13:34,92 --> 0:13:36,16
STEVE SPANGLER NARRATING:
No, we're not doing--


408
0:13:36,16 --> 0:13:37,61
uh, no, you know what, Dad?


409
0:13:37,61 --> 0:13:40,32
That's probably a really good
weekend project for Wayne or


410
0:13:40,32 --> 0:13:43,9
Holly to help with, but I was
thinking, maybe you could do


411
0:13:43,9 --> 0:13:44,72
just-- you and Mom could
do a little trick.


412
0:13:44,72 --> 0:13:48,28
So Mom, you grab linking rings
and do the little ring thing


413
0:13:48,28 --> 0:13:49,39
and show me what you're
working on.


414
0:13:49,39 --> 0:13:50,52
Just do something small.


415
0:13:50,52 --> 0:13:51,31
BRUCE: Well, that's
kind of nuts.


416
0:13:51,31 --> 0:13:53,215
You don't want to see the
big illusion outside?


417
0:13:53,215 --> 0:13:54,42
STEVE SPANGLER: Please.


418
0:13:54,42 --> 0:13:55,96
Please just do something
small.


419
0:13:55,96 --> 0:13:58,0
BRUCE: We've got something
with a bolt and a nut.


420
0:13:58,0 --> 0:13:58,53
Would that work?


421
0:13:58,53 --> 0:13:59,2
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah,
that's perfect.


422
0:13:59,2 --> 0:13:59,53
Let's do it.


423
0:13:59,53 --> 0:14:2,6
BRUCE: All right, let's do it.


424
0:14:2,6 --> 0:14:3,43
STEVE SPANGLER: I
love this stuff.


425
0:14:3,43 --> 0:14:6,806
When's he's doing the small
stuff that he's working on.


426
0:14:6,806 --> 0:14:9,3
BRUCE: Well, I told you it was
kind of nuts, and it is,


427
0:14:9,3 --> 0:14:11,39
because we use a
bolt and a nut.


428
0:14:11,39 --> 0:14:13,53
And what I'd like for you to
do is I'd like for you to


429
0:14:13,53 --> 0:14:16,27
thread the nut onto the bolt.


430
0:14:16,27 --> 0:14:19,8
About halfway would
be really good.


431
0:14:19,8 --> 0:14:20,48
So you believe in
psychic things?


432
0:14:20,48 --> 0:14:21,35
Telekinesis?


433
0:14:21,35 --> 0:14:23,3
The power of the mind
to control objects?


434
0:14:23,3 --> 0:14:25,19
STEVE SPANGLER: Of
course I do.


435
0:14:25,19 --> 0:14:26,84
BRUCE: That's what we're
gonna try to do.


436
0:14:26,84 --> 0:14:27,54
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


437
0:14:27,54 --> 0:14:29,49
BRUCE: Let me roll up my
sleeves as if I were a


438
0:14:29,49 --> 0:14:29,85
professional.


439
0:14:29,85 --> 0:14:31,62
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


440
0:14:31,62 --> 0:14:34,79
BRUCE: Now, the idea is to
concentrate on that--


441
0:14:34,79 --> 0:14:35,79
oh, you're good.


442
0:14:35,79 --> 0:14:38,6
You are really good.


443
0:14:38,6 --> 0:14:39,23
Look at that.


444
0:14:39,23 --> 0:14:40,705
That is amazing.


445
0:14:40,705 --> 0:14:42,4
STEVE SPANGLER: There's no
threads or anything.


446
0:14:42,4 --> 0:14:45,45
BRUCE: No.


447
0:14:45,45 --> 0:14:47,465
This would be great if they used
these to build airplanes,


448
0:14:47,465 --> 0:14:48,76
wouldn't it?


449
0:14:48,76 --> 0:14:50,472
Then you'd just concentrate
on the plane and


450
0:14:50,472 --> 0:14:51,68
the wing falls off.


451
0:14:51,68 --> 0:14:53,99
STEVE SPANGLER: I was used to
him doing like three sponge


452
0:14:53,99 --> 0:14:55,67
balls in my hand and then
there's rabbits.


453
0:14:55,67 --> 0:14:57,968
And now there's a bolt
that comes off.


454
0:14:57,968 --> 0:14:59,252
This is good.


455
0:14:59,252 --> 0:15:3,63
BRUCE: Well, this is the way
we develop a routine, is we


456
0:15:3,63 --> 0:15:5,305
practice and practice
and practice.


457
0:15:5,305 --> 0:15:6,97
STEVE SPANGLER: Are you
concentrating with your mind


458
0:15:6,97 --> 0:15:7,9
again to make that happen?


459
0:15:7,9 --> 0:15:8,91
BRUCE: Oh, yes, absolutely.


460
0:15:8,91 --> 0:15:9,65
STEVE SPANGLER: I can tell.


461
0:15:9,65 --> 0:15:13,125
BRUCE: Communicating
with the spirits.


462
0:15:13,125 --> 0:15:13,67
That's it.


463
0:15:13,67 --> 0:15:15,41
STEVE SPANGLER: It's cool.


464
0:15:15,41 --> 0:15:16,52
Magic is so cool.


465
0:15:16,52 --> 0:15:17,41
Mom, do this, would you?


466
0:15:17,41 --> 0:15:18,66
Do the ring thing.


467
0:15:18,66 --> 0:15:24,854



468
0:15:24,854 --> 0:15:27,5
Is that totally cool or what?


469
0:15:27,5 --> 0:15:30,99
All right, when your
mom can [GASP]


470
0:15:30,99 --> 0:15:32,82
Do you understand that birthday
parties were so


471
0:15:32,82 --> 0:15:34,71
awesome at my house?


472
0:15:34,71 --> 0:15:36,15
They were.


473
0:15:36,15 --> 0:15:38,32
So when I was a kid, I remember
mom and dad making


474
0:15:38,32 --> 0:15:39,23
these magic products.


475
0:15:39,23 --> 0:15:41,7
So in addition to having the
magic school, they had these


476
0:15:41,7 --> 0:15:41,98
magic products.


477
0:15:41,98 --> 0:15:43,45
And so, this was
their catalog.


478
0:15:43,45 --> 0:15:46,46
You have to remember this
is back in the '70s.


479
0:15:46,46 --> 0:15:49,5
And inside the catalog, there
are these things about-- oh,


480
0:15:49,5 --> 0:15:51,27
you remember that, the fake
blood that they were talking


481
0:15:51,27 --> 0:15:52,7
about before?


482
0:15:52,7 --> 0:15:54,76
But there's a whole line of
chemical magic tricks.


483
0:15:54,76 --> 0:15:56,75
And I guess what was
cool is that--


484
0:15:56,75 --> 0:15:59,32
I didn't realize this,
but when--


485
0:15:59,32 --> 0:16:2,82
our YouTube viewers know Doug
Hotis, my chemistry teacher--


486
0:16:2,82 --> 0:16:6,27
I remember getting to blow him
away when he did the classic


487
0:16:6,27 --> 0:16:8,2
wine water that you just
saw where you turn the


488
0:16:8,2 --> 0:16:8,97
water into the wine.


489
0:16:8,97 --> 0:16:11,41
But I did your version,
and he had never seen


490
0:16:11,41 --> 0:16:11,93
anything like that.


491
0:16:11,93 --> 0:16:14,75
So what was the thought behind
creating a whole new line of


492
0:16:14,75 --> 0:16:16,71
chemical magic for magicians?


493
0:16:16,71 --> 0:16:19,12
BRUCE: Well, the whole idea
of bringing magic into the


494
0:16:19,12 --> 0:16:20,29
classroom is--


495
0:16:20,29 --> 0:16:23,74
we kind of go along with what
Socrates said, that wisdom


496
0:16:23,74 --> 0:16:25,2
begins in wonder.


497
0:16:25,2 --> 0:16:27,59
Once you get a kid
to ask, how?


498
0:16:27,59 --> 0:16:28,29
How did that happen?


499
0:16:28,29 --> 0:16:29,51
Why did that happen?


500
0:16:29,51 --> 0:16:30,63
They're fully engaged.


501
0:16:30,63 --> 0:16:33,35
The mind is open, and they're
ready then to learn something.


502
0:16:33,35 --> 0:16:35,29
So we wanted to do something
that was a little different.


503
0:16:35,29 --> 0:16:38,42
What they used back in those
early days was an indicator


504
0:16:38,42 --> 0:16:41,8
dye that had a characteristic
pink color that's not like


505
0:16:41,8 --> 0:16:41,92
anything else.


506
0:16:41,92 --> 0:16:43,5
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah, that's
exactly what they saw.


507
0:16:43,5 --> 0:16:46,95
I was telling them about
grinding up the Ex-Lax and


508
0:16:46,95 --> 0:16:48,2
creating the phenolphthalein.


509
0:16:48,2 --> 0:16:50,22
BRUCE: So the way to change
that into a magic trick is


510
0:16:50,22 --> 0:16:53,42
change the color, which is a
little harder to do, or change


511
0:16:53,42 --> 0:16:54,45
the way it reacts.


512
0:16:54,45 --> 0:16:56,74
And so we decided to
do the latter.


513
0:16:56,74 --> 0:16:58,9
We wanted to change
the reactions.


514
0:16:58,9 --> 0:16:59,5
Would you like for
me to show you?


515
0:16:59,5 --> 0:17:0,27
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah,
of course.


516
0:17:0,27 --> 0:17:1,1
I'm setting you up for this.


517
0:17:1,1 --> 0:17:2,49
I'm your straight man.


518
0:17:2,49 --> 0:17:4,609
BRUCE: I guess.


519
0:17:4,609 --> 0:17:7,19
OK, well, we start
out now with two


520
0:17:7,19 --> 0:17:8,369
perfectly clear liquids.


521
0:17:8,369 --> 0:17:8,93
STEVE SPANGLER: Got it.


522
0:17:8,93 --> 0:17:9,91
BRUCE: OK.


523
0:17:9,91 --> 0:17:12,48
And normally, when you mix those
together, you would get


524
0:17:12,48 --> 0:17:14,0
an instant color change.


525
0:17:14,0 --> 0:17:17,14
But you'll notice that
they remain clear.


526
0:17:17,14 --> 0:17:18,54
The chemicals are fully mixed.


527
0:17:18,54 --> 0:17:19,29
But they remain clear.


528
0:17:19,29 --> 0:17:20,54
STEVE SPANGLER: It's just
a glass of water.


529
0:17:20,54 --> 0:17:21,369
BRUCE: That's right.


530
0:17:21,369 --> 0:17:26,619
We don't have to secretly add a
little dye to it or do some


531
0:17:26,619 --> 0:17:30,17
of the things that we
used to have to do.


532
0:17:30,17 --> 0:17:33,13
And so we have is a timed
chemical reaction.


533
0:17:33,13 --> 0:17:36,47
It takes it from a science
demonstration, the typical


534
0:17:36,47 --> 0:17:37,75
science demonstration.


535
0:17:37,75 --> 0:17:39,55
Although many teachers
use this now


536
0:17:39,55 --> 0:17:41,25
because it's in the books.


537
0:17:41,25 --> 0:17:42,835
And you sell it, too.


538
0:17:42,835 --> 0:17:43,73
STEVE SPANGLER NARRATING:
Yeah, a different


539
0:17:43,73 --> 0:17:47,4
version of it, yeah.


540
0:17:47,4 --> 0:17:48,53
You gotta carry on
the tradition.


541
0:17:48,53 --> 0:17:50,11
This was very amazing.


542
0:17:50,11 --> 0:17:52,77
When I walked into Doug Hotis's
class, it was an


543
0:17:52,77 --> 0:17:55,62
instant reputation builder
because I said, watch this.


544
0:17:55,62 --> 0:17:59,13
And immediately, I went from a
junior in high school that's


545
0:17:59,13 --> 0:18:2,24
just screwing around to "get
over here, kid, I need to see


546
0:18:2,24 --> 0:18:4,55
this." And that was the
beginning of that


547
0:18:4,55 --> 0:18:5,5
relationship.


548
0:18:5,5 --> 0:18:8,5
BRUCE: And one of the things
you said was, we need to do


549
0:18:8,5 --> 0:18:9,2
something patriotic.


550
0:18:9,2 --> 0:18:10,91
Can you do this in red,
white, and blue?


551
0:18:10,91 --> 0:18:13,65
And so then, we added the
second part of it.


552
0:18:13,65 --> 0:18:17,8
We added the red dye, changed
this pink to red, and used


553
0:18:17,8 --> 0:18:21,5
blue, and actually produced a
milk-like white change, using


554
0:18:21,5 --> 0:18:22,68
the same family of reactions.


555
0:18:22,68 --> 0:18:23,67
STEVE SPANGLER: All right, let's
do it again and explain


556
0:18:23,67 --> 0:18:24,9
the science.


557
0:18:24,9 --> 0:18:26,6
BRUCE: All right.


558
0:18:26,6 --> 0:18:29,58
We actually have created a
little war here between two


559
0:18:29,58 --> 0:18:30,58
sets of chemicals.


560
0:18:30,58 --> 0:18:31,8
They're gonna fight
for dominance.


561
0:18:31,8 --> 0:18:35,1
When we mix them together, the
chemicals that produce an acid


562
0:18:35,1 --> 0:18:37,34
are struggling to dominate
over those


563
0:18:37,34 --> 0:18:38,71
that produce a base.


564
0:18:38,71 --> 0:18:42,44
And it takes some time for
that little war to go on.


565
0:18:42,44 --> 0:18:43,78
So that's what you're seeing.


566
0:18:43,78 --> 0:18:45,5
STEVE SPANGLER: So they would
teach a reaction like this


567
0:18:45,5 --> 0:18:47,63
when they're doing redox
reactions or whatever.


568
0:18:47,63 --> 0:18:49,69
BRUCE: It's an oxidation
reduction reaction.


569
0:18:49,69 --> 0:18:50,63
That's right.


570
0:18:50,63 --> 0:18:53,81
So, we've got-- our dye is
actually in here, which is


571
0:18:53,81 --> 0:18:57,33
colorless in its neutral
or acidic state.


572
0:18:57,33 --> 0:18:59,94
So this one is slightly
acidic.


573
0:18:59,94 --> 0:19:2,64
This over here contains a
reducing agent which is going


574
0:19:2,64 --> 0:19:5,3
to produce this little war.


575
0:19:5,3 --> 0:19:5,52
Should we do it?


576
0:19:5,52 --> 0:19:6,16
STEVE SPANGLER: Yep, do it.


577
0:19:6,16 --> 0:19:7,16
BRUCE: All right.


578
0:19:7,16 --> 0:19:11,4
So now, that starts
the reaction.


579
0:19:11,4 --> 0:19:15,69
And we're pouring it back and
forth to show how clean it is,


580
0:19:15,69 --> 0:19:18,76
in terms of no gimmicks
or dyes.


581
0:19:18,76 --> 0:19:21,57
But we're also giving it a
chance to mix absolutely


582
0:19:21,57 --> 0:19:25,59
thoroughly, so that we get
a nice color change.


583
0:19:25,59 --> 0:19:28,59
STEVE SPANGLER: So when you
produced a product called


584
0:19:28,59 --> 0:19:31,6
Splash of Color, you had eight
full colors of the rainbow.


585
0:19:31,6 --> 0:19:32,77
BRUCE: Isn't that crazy?


586
0:19:32,77 --> 0:19:33,54
STEVE SPANGLER: I know.


587
0:19:33,54 --> 0:19:35,0
BRUCE: Who in their right
mind would do that?


588
0:19:35,0 --> 0:19:36,59
STEVE SPANGLER: It was hard.


589
0:19:36,59 --> 0:19:39,78
Because how great-- and you
need to know that there's


590
0:19:39,78 --> 0:19:42,22
teachers today in the classroom
doing a version of


591
0:19:42,22 --> 0:19:46,31
that to a Kermit the Frog kind
of song, "The Rainbow Song."


592
0:19:46,31 --> 0:19:47,58
But not as a time delay.


593
0:19:47,58 --> 0:19:50,24
It's when they touch it, that
time delay all the way across


594
0:19:50,24 --> 0:19:50,76
is absolutely gorgeous.


595
0:19:50,76 --> 0:19:52,5
BRUCE: You think the teachers
were amazed?


596
0:19:52,5 --> 0:19:53,46
You should've seen
the magicians.


597
0:19:53,46 --> 0:19:55,79
They had never seen anything
like this.


598
0:19:55,79 --> 0:19:58,2
They were accustomed to the--
well, they had a thing called


599
0:19:58,2 --> 0:20:2,1
Think Ink, which was clear to
black and this color, and that


600
0:20:2,1 --> 0:20:3,2
was about it.


601
0:20:3,2 --> 0:20:4,58
There were a few other
variations.


602
0:20:4,58 --> 0:20:8,19
But to have seven or eight
clocked reactions all going at


603
0:20:8,19 --> 0:20:12,58
the same time and eight glasses,
goblets changing


604
0:20:12,58 --> 0:20:14,37
color, bing bing
bing bing bing.


605
0:20:14,37 --> 0:20:16,68
They had never seen anything
like that before.


606
0:20:16,68 --> 0:20:19,86
So we took the science into the
magic community, rather


607
0:20:19,86 --> 0:20:21,34
than the other way around.


608
0:20:21,34 --> 0:20:25,183
STEVE SPANGLER: I remember as a
kid, mom and dad were on one


609
0:20:25,183 --> 0:20:28,8
of the big shows, a big magic
show for magicians, and we


610
0:20:28,8 --> 0:20:29,32
were in Kansas City, Missouri.


611
0:20:29,32 --> 0:20:30,755
And I remember seeing
you backstage.


612
0:20:30,755 --> 0:20:32,69
And I'd never seen you
in this state before,


613
0:20:32,69 --> 0:20:33,82
because you were flustered.


614
0:20:33,82 --> 0:20:37,28
And the pH of the water was
different in Kansas City than


615
0:20:37,28 --> 0:20:38,69
it was here in Denver.


616
0:20:38,69 --> 0:20:41,54
And when you went to do the
reaction, it wasn't timed


617
0:20:41,54 --> 0:20:42,33
correctly to the music.


618
0:20:42,33 --> 0:20:45,49
And so you literally had to
change the pH of the water and


619
0:20:45,49 --> 0:20:48,32
try to buffer that for the
reaction, so it would time up


620
0:20:48,32 --> 0:20:48,97
with the music.


621
0:20:48,97 --> 0:20:52,38
BRUCE: And not only that, the
water had been softened, so


622
0:20:52,38 --> 0:20:55,36
they had added chemicals to it,
which affected not only


623
0:20:55,36 --> 0:20:58,32
the pH, but the oxidation
reduction reaction


624
0:20:58,32 --> 0:20:59,66
that was going on.


625
0:20:59,66 --> 0:21:2,39
So we had to literally reinvent
the chemistry on the


626
0:21:2,39 --> 0:21:4,47
spot for a show that night.


627
0:21:4,47 --> 0:21:6,3
And it worked out pretty
well, didn't it?


628
0:21:6,3 --> 0:21:6,47
STEVE SPANGLER: It was great.


629
0:21:6,47 --> 0:21:8,11
It's one of those things
I'll never forget.


630
0:21:8,11 --> 0:21:10,17
There's a classic that you
do that really is yours.


631
0:21:10,17 --> 0:21:12,23
Nobody's ever done it, and
it's a thing called


632
0:21:12,23 --> 0:21:12,71
Switcheroo.


633
0:21:12,71 --> 0:21:14,43
And so if you don't mind,
let's see Switcheroo.


634
0:21:14,43 --> 0:21:15,28
BRUCE: Let's set it up.


635
0:21:15,28 --> 0:21:16,89
STEVE SPANGLER: All right,
so this will


636
0:21:16,89 --> 0:21:18,58
go down as a classic.


637
0:21:18,58 --> 0:21:21,25
This is your signature
demonstration in my mind.


638
0:21:21,25 --> 0:21:21,88
BRUCE: All right.


639
0:21:21,88 --> 0:21:23,68
STEVE SPANGLER: OK, so do it
the way you do it for kids.


640
0:21:23,68 --> 0:21:26,7
BRUCE: Well, in the classroom,
we ask the kids if they know


641
0:21:26,7 --> 0:21:27,7
what a chameleon is.


642
0:21:27,7 --> 0:21:29,58
Now, almost all the kids know
what a chameleon is.


643
0:21:29,58 --> 0:21:30,93
Most of them tell
us it's somebody


644
0:21:30,93 --> 0:21:32,0
who tells funny stories.


645
0:21:32,0 --> 0:21:33,54
And then we tell them, no,
that's a comedian.


646
0:21:33,54 --> 0:21:33,92
STEVE SPANGLER: Got it.


647
0:21:33,92 --> 0:21:36,62
BRUCE: OK, but then they get
the chameleon thing right.


648
0:21:36,62 --> 0:21:38,76
We tell them we didn't bring
any live animals.


649
0:21:38,76 --> 0:21:40,56
But we did bring a
chameleon color.


650
0:21:40,56 --> 0:21:43,71
This is a yellow chameleon
color.


651
0:21:43,71 --> 0:21:45,11
I think we set this up wrong.


652
0:21:45,11 --> 0:21:46,11
It's in the wrong color glass.


653
0:21:46,11 --> 0:21:46,51
Chameleons--


654
0:21:46,51 --> 0:21:47,405
STEVE SPANGLER: It's
in the red glass.


655
0:21:47,405 --> 0:21:49,16
BRUCE: Yeah, they like to
blend in with their


656
0:21:49,16 --> 0:21:49,77
background.


657
0:21:49,77 --> 0:21:51,85
If you'll hang on to this, let
me see what we have over here.


658
0:21:51,85 --> 0:21:55,48
Oh, this is another chameleon
color, but it also is in the


659
0:21:55,48 --> 0:21:56,52
wrong color glass.


660
0:21:56,52 --> 0:21:57,882
STEVE SPANGLER: He's doing
schtick right now.


661
0:21:57,882 --> 0:21:59,65
BRUCE: There's another
problem.


662
0:21:59,65 --> 0:21:59,76
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.


663
0:21:59,76 --> 0:22:1,23
BRUCE: I know we've had
a water shortage.


664
0:22:1,23 --> 0:22:2,57
STEVE SPANGLER: Of course
we have, Dad.


665
0:22:2,57 --> 0:22:3,32
I mean, Mr. Magician.


666
0:22:3,32 --> 0:22:5,96
BRUCE: With all these people
watching, don't you think we


667
0:22:5,96 --> 0:22:7,27
could feel these
up to the top?


668
0:22:7,27 --> 0:22:8,505
STEVE SPANGLER: And we should.


669
0:22:8,505 --> 0:22:10,86
BRUCE: That way, everybody can
see, Those that are close to


670
0:22:10,86 --> 0:22:12,68
the set, and those
farther away.


671
0:22:12,68 --> 0:22:14,93
So let's fill this one
up to the very top.


672
0:22:14,93 --> 0:22:17,18
STEVE SPANGLER: So there's
red in the yellow glass.


673
0:22:17,18 --> 0:22:21,465
BRUCE: And yellow in
the red glass.


674
0:22:21,465 --> 0:22:23,15
STEVE SPANGLER: So this
is very wrong.


675
0:22:23,15 --> 0:22:26,28
BRUCE: This is like an optical
illusion, a trick of the eyes.


676
0:22:26,28 --> 0:22:28,42
So keep them separate here.


677
0:22:28,42 --> 0:22:28,88
That's right.


678
0:22:28,88 --> 0:22:30,47
So everybody knows where
the yellow one is


679
0:22:30,47 --> 0:22:31,47
and the red one is.


680
0:22:31,47 --> 0:22:33,92
And we're going to bring them
closer together, without


681
0:22:33,92 --> 0:22:36,47
letting them touch, because
that would be cheating.


682
0:22:36,47 --> 0:22:39,73
And you keep one eye on the
yellow glass, one-- or the red


683
0:22:39,73 --> 0:22:41,12
yellow chameleon.


684
0:22:41,12 --> 0:22:43,76
One eye on the red, and
the other eye on you.


685
0:22:43,76 --> 0:22:44,93
STEVE SPANGLER: Whatever
it might be.


686
0:22:44,93 --> 0:22:47,11
BRUCE: We're short a couple
of eyes there, aren't we.


687
0:22:47,11 --> 0:22:49,1
And it gets harder and harder
to tell which one's the red


688
0:22:49,1 --> 0:22:50,92
one and which one's
the yellow one.


689
0:22:50,92 --> 0:22:53,92
But as you stare at it, you
begin to see why we call it


690
0:22:53,92 --> 0:22:56,76
the chameleon colors,
because the red has


691
0:22:56,76 --> 0:22:58,29
gone to the red glass.


692
0:22:58,29 --> 0:22:58,97
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.


693
0:22:58,97 --> 0:23:0,55
BRUCE: The yellow one here's
starting to look a little


694
0:23:0,55 --> 0:23:0,9
orange-ish.


695
0:23:0,9 --> 0:23:1,59
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.


696
0:23:1,59 --> 0:23:2,68
BRUCE: And now we can
move it away.


697
0:23:2,68 --> 0:23:4,72
STEVE SPANGLER: Look at this.


698
0:23:4,72 --> 0:23:5,45
There it is.


699
0:23:5,45 --> 0:23:7,42
Red over here in this glass.


700
0:23:7,42 --> 0:23:8,96
Yellow sits over here
in this glass.


701
0:23:8,96 --> 0:23:11,74
BRUCE: And it will continue to
get yellower and yellower as


702
0:23:11,74 --> 0:23:13,655
it stills there for
a little while.


703
0:23:13,655 --> 0:23:16,79
STEVE SPANGLER: That's when
the kids applaud and--


704
0:23:16,79 --> 0:23:18,1
there it is, right there.


705
0:23:18,1 --> 0:23:18,72
That's perfect.


706
0:23:18,72 --> 0:23:19,81
Would you look at that?


707
0:23:19,81 --> 0:23:20,96
It's all in the story.


708
0:23:20,96 --> 0:23:22,76
Yellow is over here,
red's over here.


709
0:23:22,76 --> 0:23:25,145
BRUCE: And that it gives us an
opportunity then to talk to


710
0:23:25,145 --> 0:23:27,27
them about oxidation
reduction reactions


711
0:23:27,27 --> 0:23:28,93
and acid base reactions.


712
0:23:28,93 --> 0:23:30,63
STEVE SPANGLER: But you forgot,
nobody actually cares.


713
0:23:30,63 --> 0:23:33,1
They're just going, they changed
color, and you're


714
0:23:33,1 --> 0:23:34,75
trying to say oxidation
reaction.


715
0:23:34,75 --> 0:23:36,27
But they could care less.


716
0:23:36,27 --> 0:23:37,36
They're looking at this thing.


717
0:23:37,36 --> 0:23:39,35
BRUCE: The important thing is
that they start to wonder and


718
0:23:39,35 --> 0:23:40,81
they start to ask questions.


719
0:23:40,81 --> 0:23:42,53
And that's when the mind
is open and we can


720
0:23:42,53 --> 0:23:43,43
start feeding them.


721
0:23:43,43 --> 0:23:43,81
STEVE SPANGLER: Cheers.


722
0:23:43,81 --> 0:23:45,37
BRUCE: Don't drink that!


723
0:23:45,37 --> 0:23:46,9
Never drink your experiments.


724
0:23:46,9 --> 0:23:47,76
STEVE SPANGLER: OK, Dad.


725
0:23:47,76 --> 0:23:50,16
BRUCE: It's a rule.


726
0:23:50,16 --> 0:23:53,15
STEVE SPANGLER: Well, I'll
probably go down with somebody


727
0:23:53,15 --> 0:23:55,19
going, Mentos and Diet Coke.


728
0:23:55,19 --> 0:23:59,33
You, however, are much better
than Mentos and Diet Coke.


729
0:23:59,33 --> 0:24:1,98
You invented fake blood.


730
0:24:1,98 --> 0:24:4,84
This is the stuff that you sold
to Universal Studios and


731
0:24:4,84 --> 0:24:6,55
Paramount Pictures.


732
0:24:6,55 --> 0:24:7,71
You used to make it
in the basement.


733
0:24:7,71 --> 0:24:9,61
That was the coolest thing, is
you'd bring friends over to


734
0:24:9,61 --> 0:24:13,1
the basement and you had these
blenders that were set up.


735
0:24:13,1 --> 0:24:14,69
So how'd you get into
the blood business?


736
0:24:14,69 --> 0:24:16,26
How'd you make fake blood?


737
0:24:16,26 --> 0:24:20,8
BRUCE: Back in the '50s,
Universal Studios came out


738
0:24:20,8 --> 0:24:23,64
with a movie called Macumba
Love, which was about voodoo.


739
0:24:23,64 --> 0:24:26,66
And it was, I guess, a B-rated
movie would be--


740
0:24:26,66 --> 0:24:27,31
KITTY: Not good.


741
0:24:27,31 --> 0:24:29,72
BRUCE: Not the greatest movie.


742
0:24:29,72 --> 0:24:32,58
But they wanted something
to promote the movie.


743
0:24:32,58 --> 0:24:33,75
They wanted something--


744
0:24:33,75 --> 0:24:36,2
back in those days, you'd do
something in the lobby or out


745
0:24:36,2 --> 0:24:37,4
in front of the theater.


746
0:24:37,4 --> 0:24:40,38
And kids on Saturday with some
money to spend would say, oh,


747
0:24:40,38 --> 0:24:41,41
I think I wanna go
see that movie.


748
0:24:41,41 --> 0:24:42,84
STEVE SPANGLER: Because how much
was a movie back then?


749
0:24:42,84 --> 0:24:44,898
BRUCE: A quarter.


750
0:24:44,898 --> 0:24:46,24
STEVE SPANGLER: It's pretty
close to that


751
0:24:46,24 --> 0:24:46,98
now, so it's fine.


752
0:24:46,98 --> 0:24:48,69
BRUCE: Yeah, and popcorn
was a dime.


753
0:24:48,69 --> 0:24:50,47
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah,
I got it.


754
0:24:50,47 --> 0:24:51,67
BRUCE: Dinosaurs roamed
the earth.


755
0:24:51,67 --> 0:24:54,28
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah, the
earth was still cooling.


756
0:24:54,28 --> 0:24:55,95
So, you're a barker.


757
0:24:55,95 --> 0:24:59,96
So there'd be a show out in
front of the theater and you


758
0:24:59,96 --> 0:25:0,47
created it.


759
0:25:0,47 --> 0:25:2,31
So what year was that that
this all happened?


760
0:25:2,31 --> 0:25:7,285
BRUCE: Oh, I'm thinking 1959.


761
0:25:7,285 --> 0:25:8,99
STEVE SPANGLER: So what was your
voodoo trick that you had


762
0:25:8,99 --> 0:25:9,875
to come up with?


763
0:25:9,875 --> 0:25:12,99
BRUCE: You simply cleaned off
your arm, you took a needle,


764
0:25:12,99 --> 0:25:14,865
and you shoved it through
your arm.


765
0:25:14,865 --> 0:25:17,255
STEVE SPANGLER: That's
a great trick.


766
0:25:17,255 --> 0:25:21,67
And then you marketed it under
the name You-Do Voodoo.


767
0:25:21,67 --> 0:25:23,32
It wasn't invented to
be a magic trick.


768
0:25:23,32 --> 0:25:25,7
It was invented to be
something to draw


769
0:25:25,7 --> 0:25:26,17
people into the movie.


770
0:25:26,17 --> 0:25:27,14
KITTY: A geek trick.


771
0:25:27,14 --> 0:25:27,43
BRUCE: A geek trick.


772
0:25:27,43 --> 0:25:29,15
A geek stunt.


773
0:25:29,15 --> 0:25:31,19
So we took it down.


774
0:25:31,19 --> 0:25:32,75
I was working in a magic
shop at the time.


775
0:25:32,75 --> 0:25:34,79
We took it down to the shop and
packaged it up and put it


776
0:25:34,79 --> 0:25:36,94
on the counter to see if
anybody would buy it.


777
0:25:36,94 --> 0:25:38,71
And lo and behold, the magicians
thought it was a


778
0:25:38,71 --> 0:25:40,11
magic trick.


779
0:25:40,11 --> 0:25:44,69
And so we started making them
up a dozen at a time.


780
0:25:44,69 --> 0:25:48,0
This is one of few tricks that
have survived all these years,


781
0:25:48,0 --> 0:25:49,64
over 50, 60 years.


782
0:25:49,64 --> 0:25:51,826
KITTY: We've made thousands
of them.


783
0:25:51,826 --> 0:25:53,48
STEVE SPANGLER: But you don't
make them anymore, right?


784
0:25:53,48 --> 0:25:54,26
So people online--


785
0:25:54,26 --> 0:25:57,31
you can find them on eBay so
you're gonna pay a pretty


786
0:25:57,31 --> 0:25:58,97
penny for one of these.


787
0:25:58,97 --> 0:26:1,14
The kicker was, it really
fooled people.


788
0:26:1,14 --> 0:26:2,93
It fooled doctors and nurses.


789
0:26:2,93 --> 0:26:5,15
It really looked like you were
putting a needle in here and


790
0:26:5,15 --> 0:26:5,41
coming out here.


791
0:26:5,41 --> 0:26:6,7
We're not gonna be gory
on this, but--


792
0:26:6,7 --> 0:26:9,49
BRUCE: One of the neatest things
to do is, when you go


793
0:26:9,49 --> 0:26:13,2
in for your annual and you get
a blood check, and the


794
0:26:13,2 --> 0:26:14,81
phlebotomist comes in, and
she says, now this


795
0:26:14,81 --> 0:26:15,61
won't hurt a bit.


796
0:26:15,61 --> 0:26:17,82
And you say, wait, I'll get it
for you here and you shove the


797
0:26:17,82 --> 0:26:18,95
needle in your arm and you
get blood gushing.


798
0:26:18,95 --> 0:26:20,246
STEVE SPANGLER: Do you see
why I had to be in


799
0:26:20,246 --> 0:26:20,806
therapy going around?


800
0:26:20,806 --> 0:26:23,92
Do you see why the three of us,
my sister and brother--


801
0:26:23,92 --> 0:26:26,9
got it from them.


802
0:26:26,9 --> 0:26:28,4
All right, so here, let's take
a look at the blood.


803
0:26:28,4 --> 0:26:29,1
The blood was very cool.


804
0:26:29,1 --> 0:26:32,77
I remember as a kid putting
blood in containers like this.


805
0:26:32,77 --> 0:26:34,95
This blood's very cool,
so I'll put it on me.


806
0:26:34,95 --> 0:26:36,89
But I want you to talk a little
bit about the blood.


807
0:26:36,89 --> 0:26:38,91
How is this different than the
blood that you would just


808
0:26:38,91 --> 0:26:40,1
make, like for Halloween?


809
0:26:40,1 --> 0:26:44,91
BRUCE: We needed blood that
would look good in sunlight,


810
0:26:44,91 --> 0:26:49,14
would not change color when you
brought it indoors, under


811
0:26:49,14 --> 0:26:51,91
incandescent light or
fluorescent lights, that would


812
0:26:51,91 --> 0:26:55,23
run smoothly across the skin,
and most importantly, if you


813
0:26:55,23 --> 0:26:58,9
happen to get it on a
multi-thousand dollar


814
0:26:58,9 --> 0:27:0,57
wardrobe, you had to be
able to get it out.


815
0:27:0,57 --> 0:27:3,78
Well, all of the pigment in
this blood is sealed up in


816
0:27:3,78 --> 0:27:6,35
tiny little capsules,
microscopic capsules


817
0:27:6,35 --> 0:27:7,21
about the size of--


818
0:27:7,21 --> 0:27:8,96
STEVE SPANGLER: No, I just
did that finger.


819
0:27:8,96 --> 0:27:10,34
It was the wrong one.


820
0:27:10,34 --> 0:27:12,99
BRUCE: --a human bloody
corpuscle.


821
0:27:12,99 --> 0:27:15,19
And when they dry, you
can just brush


822
0:27:15,19 --> 0:27:16,24
it off of your clothes.


823
0:27:16,24 --> 0:27:17,57
STEVE SPANGLER: It
looks so good.


824
0:27:17,57 --> 0:27:19,925
BRUCE: It just doesn't strain.


825
0:27:19,925 --> 0:27:23,28
STEVE SPANGLER: I had a chance
to be able to see Frank Oz


826
0:27:23,28 --> 0:27:25,19
here recently, you know,
with the Muppet fame.


827
0:27:25,19 --> 0:27:29,57
And Jim Henson used to use your
blood for the puppets,


828
0:27:29,57 --> 0:27:32,82
because there's very thin little
tubes, almost like


829
0:27:32,82 --> 0:27:34,38
capillary-like tubes.


830
0:27:34,38 --> 0:27:36,71
And when you look at it this
way, look, this is a whole


831
0:27:36,71 --> 0:27:37,39
blood shelf.


832
0:27:37,39 --> 0:27:37,89
See this?


833
0:27:37,89 --> 0:27:40,56
A shelf with blood tricks.


834
0:27:40,56 --> 0:27:41,78
Look at this.


835
0:27:41,78 --> 0:27:45,21
This is what blew people away,
because it really looked like


836
0:27:45,21 --> 0:27:46,84
there were serum and plasma.


837
0:27:46,84 --> 0:27:47,12
Correct?


838
0:27:47,12 --> 0:27:49,36
BRUCE: You can see that all of
the color separates to the


839
0:27:49,36 --> 0:27:51,736
bottom, as it should.


840
0:27:51,736 --> 0:27:54,9
KITTY: And when it dries,
you just brush it off.


841
0:27:54,9 --> 0:27:55,54
STEVE SPANGLER: And not
available anymore.


842
0:27:55,54 --> 0:27:57,35
BRUCE: Not available anymore.


843
0:27:57,35 --> 0:27:59,58
STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah,
That's done.


844
0:27:59,58 --> 0:28:0,855
This is very cool.


845
0:28:0,855 --> 0:28:2,5
I've got to go see what else
you did to my room.


846
0:28:2,5 --> 0:28:3,86
KITTY: What did you
do to this thing?


847
0:28:3,86 --> 0:28:5,99
STEVE SPANGLER: Where's
the ping pong table?


848
0:28:5,99 --> 0:28:7,925
Where's the ping pong table?


849
0:28:7,925 --> 0:28:10,27
Well, I hope you enjoyed our
little trip down memory lane.


850
0:28:10,27 --> 0:28:11,92
Kind of the normal house
I grew up in,


851
0:28:11,92 --> 0:28:14,67
normal family, you know.


852
0:28:14,67 --> 0:28:16,45
She even took down my Farrah
Fawcett poster.


853
0:28:16,45 --> 0:28:18,3
There's nothing of
my room left.


854
0:28:18,3 --> 0:28:20,8
Is this really how we
have to end this?


855
0:28:20,8 --> 0:28:20,846
KITTY: Yeah.


856
0:28:20,846 --> 0:28:21,57
Put that in there.


857
0:28:21,57 --> 0:28:23,835
STEVE SPANGLER: I know, I've
done the routine before.


858
0:28:23,835 --> 0:28:25,94
BRUCE: Remember all those years
you used to terrorize


859
0:28:25,94 --> 0:28:27,0
your sister with this thing?


860
0:28:27,0 --> 0:28:27,81
KITTY: You were so
mean to her.


861
0:28:27,81 --> 0:28:28,39
STEVE SPANGLER: I know, but
she was mean to me.


862
0:28:28,39 --> 0:28:29,33
BRUCE: It's payback time.


863
0:28:29,33 --> 0:28:29,63
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


864
0:28:29,63 --> 0:28:30,53
BRUCE: Here we go.


865
0:28:30,53 --> 0:28:34,524
One, two, three.


866
0:28:34,524 --> 0:28:36,26
STEVE SPANGLER: Give me that.


867
0:28:36,26 --> 0:28:38,37
Radioshack.


868
0:28:38,37 --> 0:28:40,64
Magicians.


869
0:28:40,64 --> 0:28:41,91
Can you get me out
of here, please?


870
0:28:41,91 --> 0:28:43,425
BRUCE: Let's go play
in the street.


871
0:28:43,425 --> 0:28:44,3
STEVE SPANGLER: No.


872
0:28:44,3 --> 0:28:45,715
Can you guys get me out
of here, please?


873
0:28:45,715 --> 0:28:46,41
BRUCE: No.


874
0:28:46,41 --> 0:28:47,693
KITTY: We're going to
go play a song.


875
0:28:47,693 --> 0:28:48,943
STEVE SPANGLER: Come on, guys.


876
0:28:48,943 --> 0:28:51,43



877
0:28:51,43 --> 0:28:54,73
Hey, this isn't funny.


878
0:28:54,73 --> 0:28:57,415
Call Holly right now.


879
0:28:57,415 --> 0:28:58,385
Hey!


880
0:28:58,385 --> 0:28:59,83
Don't play your dumb
songs again.


881
0:28:59,83 --> 0:29:1,52
Just get me out of here.


882
0:29:1,52 --> 0:29:8,2



883
0:29:8,2 --> 0:29:9,27
Lunch.


884
0:29:9,27 --> 0:31:9,27
