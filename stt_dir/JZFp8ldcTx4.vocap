###117 ADRI MURGUIA: Faustino Barrientos embodies the
###118 timeless lifestyle of the Chilean gaucho, the more
###121 isolated equivalent of the North American cowboy.
###124 Bringing settlers into Patagonia was a challenge.
###127 And in 1937, Chile started handing out land claims to
###131 each colonizer who could clear 120 acres of forest in an
###134 effort to make the land fertile.
###137 Although construction of routes to Patagonia land made
###140 the gauchos more accessible, we heard that Faustino had
###143 moved far beyond the last stretch of the Pan-American
###145 Highway to Peninsula La Florida, where he continued
###148 living in complete isolation, like the original settlers.
###154 Faustino is rumored to be living alone on his land for
###156 the past 46 years, removed from civilization and
###159 technology as if time had never struck Patagonia.
###162 
###174 We set out on a journey to find Faustino Barrientos--
###176 from New York on a cold winter night.
###180 We had about a dozen bags with us and had no idea of what we
###183 were getting ourselves into.
###184 What we did know is it will take us four days of travel
###187 time to reach him.
###188 
###190 We caught an 11 hour flight to Santiago.
###193 We had a layover, and then got on a
###194 shorter flight to Balmaceda.
###196 
###198 There we met our crew, gathered our gear, loaded the
###201 truck, and drove to Cochrane, which took five hours.
###204 
###208 We spent the night there and headed out to Port Yungay in
###210 the morning to catch our ferry to Rio Bravo.
###213 It had taken us two days to get this far.
###216 And we weren't even halfway there.
###217 It was impossible to imagine how you would ever get here by
###220 horse rides from Santiago, like Faustino had probably
###223 done in the past.
###224 
###228 Patagonia's a region at the southern end of South America.
###231 The area covers about one-third of both Chile and
###234 Argentina and is home to a rich and
###236 mostly untouched ecosystem.
###239 It's an important fresh water source, which also makes it
###242 one of the least polluted places on earth.
###243 
###255 On our third day of travel, we finally arrived at the end of
###258 the Pan-American Highway, which was built to connect
###260 remote communities in the region.
###264 Its final stretch reaches Villa O'Higgins, a town
###267 formerly only accessible by plane or horse ride, which is
###270 why it's called the "Last Frontier of Chilean
###272 Patagonia." With a population of roughly 400 people, it's
###278 considered a stomping ground for explorers and scientists
###281 heading towards the South Patagonian Ice Field, which
###283 doubles as deepest lake in the Americas.
###285 
###288 While we were in O'Higgins, we visited Faustino's brother to
###291 get a better idea of what to expect from him.

###356 
###359 It seemed that Faustino had a bad reputation
###361 throughout the town.
###362 There was even a rumor that he had attempted
###364 to shoot his nephew.

###416 ADRI MURGUIA: After learning that Faustino not only
###418 disliked other people's company, but also had tried to
###420 kill one of his family members, we're more than
###423 concerned about staying with him on a deserted piece of
###425 land without escape routes or forms of communication with
###428 the outside world.
###430 But we continued on our way to find him.
###431 
###452 Since 2005, this boat started taking tourists on glacial
###456 expeditions and contributed to bringing civilization closer
###459 to those who lived out here in isolation.
###462 It was appropriately named Robinson Crusoe.
###464 
###499 I made it.
###501 We're in Faustino's land.
###504 We were told to walk straight from the shore towards the
###506 mountains and we'd find his home.
###509 I don't know if we're walking in the right
###511 direction, to be honest.
###512 
###516 As the boat took off in the distance, we realized how
###519 isolated we really were.
###520 
###525 We walked for about a mile until we finally spotted
###527 Faustino's retreat.
