###19 Hey, this is Christina Milian and this is
###21 my crazy party story.
###22 So me and my girls decided we're going to
###24 take a trip to Vegas.
###26 All of us girls had red lipstick on and high heels.
###29 We started drinking in the plane.
###31 I was drinking Bloody Marys.
###32 By the time we got to the hotel, they sent us to this
###34 VIP room where they had champagne and we made mimosas.
###38 We were just ready to party.
###39 So we went out to eat some sushi, and after that
###42 [INAUDIBLE] took us to club.
###43 We were all being sexy, touchy-feelie, having fun with
###46 each other, dancing.
###47 We started pounding tequilas and shots.
###49 We had some guys that were sitting next to us, and
###51 they're like, Ey, what's up?
###53 You guys want to party with us?
###54 And we're like, yeah!
###55 Totally!
###55 Let's go!
###56 And they were like, we're leaving!
###58 We're going to go to the strip club!
###59 You guys wanna come with us?
###60 And we're like, Yeah!
###61 Let's go!
###62 We hop in their car with them and somehow we end up at this
###66 VIP room with a bunch of Barbie dolls with giant boobs.
###69 The next thing you know, the guys break out these wads of
###71 $100 bills, and these girls ran to
###74 us like hungry piranhas.
###76 So one thing led to another, of course, more drinks, more,
###79 more, and more drinks.
###81 The same rules don't go for girls that go for guys.
###83 And the strippers had these giant balloon boobs, like
###86 motorboating them and-- you'd stick your head in-between and
###89 you go [MOTOR NOISE]
###90 We all had a stripper on us.
###92 We all had to go to the bathroom,
###93 really, really buzzed.
###94 And I think one of us hurled a little bit.
###96 One of the guys is knocking on the door.
###97 And he's like, what are you guys doing in there?
###98 I was like, she's not feeling good!
###100 And he's trying to push the door open.
###102 My other girl's holding her hair up for her and
###104 everything.
###104 Can't get hurl in your hair.
###106 And I'm like, oh my gosh, I feel like I'm sick.
###108 I feel like I'm going to be sick.
###109 A friend of mine happened to be in town.
###111 I texted him, I'm like, dude!
###112 I need you to come save us!
###113 I think somebody spiked our drinks.
###115 We made our great escape out of the bathroom.
###117 We were like, we gotta go!
###118 We have to leave!
###119 That boy was downstairs waiting for us
###121 with two silver Ferraris.
###123 And we hopped into the cars, and we were like whoa!
###126 You saved the day!
###129 And that was my craziest party story.
