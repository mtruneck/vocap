###2 PROFESSOR: OKAY, SO I HOPE YOU ALL DID WELL ON THE EXAM, AND
###4 IT'S GOOD TO BE ABLE TO JUST FOCUS ON ONE PART OF THE COURSE FROM
###8 NOW ON. I KNOW YOU'VE ALL MET WITH YOUR LAB AT LEAST ONCE OR
###13 ONCE NOW WITH REGARD TO THE BOTANY PART OF COURSE AND SEEN SOME
###17 OF THE ORGANISMS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY AND JUST
###20 MENTIONED BRIEFLY LAST TIME AS WELL AS SOME WE TALKED ABOUT
###24 EARLIER. AND THIS WEEK YOU'RE GOING TO FOCUS MORE ON VASCULAR
###29 PLANTS, GET INTO THE VASCULAR PLANTS, WHICH WE'LL START TO TALK
###31 ABOUT IN TODAY'S LAB OR TODAY'S LECTURE. SO FIRST OFF I'M GOING
###39 TO REVIEW JUST A BIT ABOUT LAND PLANTS, SOME OF THE THINGS I HAD
###43 TO SAY AT THE LAST, AT THE END OF LAST LECTURE SO WE'RE ALL ON
###46 THE SAME PAGE HERE NOW THAT YOU CAN FOCUS JUST ON THIS PART OF
###50 THE COURSE. AND THEN WE'LL EVENTUALLY GET INTO INTRODUCING
###54 VASCULAR PLANTS TODAY WHICH ARE THE PLANTS THAT WE'RE PROBABLY
###57 MOST FAMILIAR WITH. BUT FIRST I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY RECAP LIFE
###62 CYCLES BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIFE
###65 CYCLES IN THE LAST WEEK AND A HALF OR SO. AND FROM NOW ON WE'RE
###70 JUST GOING TO BE LOOKING AT LAND PLANTS. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO
###74 NOT TO GET THEIR LIFE CYCLE CONFUSED WITH SOME OF THE ONES WE
###77 TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. OKAY, SO FIRST OF ALL, OF COURSE HUMANS
###82 AND ALSO DIATOMS, AMONGST SOME OTHER ALGAE WE DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT,
###89 HAVE A LIFE CYCLE WHERE WE JUST HAVE ONE MULTICELLULAR
###93 GENERATION, A DIPLOID GENERATION, YOU KNOW, YOU AND ME. AND THE
###97 ONLY HAPLOID STAGE THEN IS THE GAMETE. SO THERE'S NO
###102 
###102 MULTICELLULAR HAPLOID GENERATION. THE FUNGI AND ACTUALLY ALSO
###110 THE CLOSEST RELATIVES OF THE LAND PLANTS HAVE A ZYGOTIC LIFE
###115 CYCLE WHERE THE ONLY DIPLOID STAGE IS THE ZYGOTE. AND THE ONLY
###120 MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM IN THAT LIFE CYCLE HAS HAPLOID NUCLEI.
###126 AND OF COURSE IN THE CASE OF FUNGI, THERE ARE ALSO SOME FUNGAL
###132 GROUPS, THE MAJORITY OF THE DIVERSITY IN THE FUNGI THAT HAVE THIS
###135 DIKARYOTIC STAGE. BUT WE WON'T BE SEEING THAT AGAIN. THAT'S
###139 EXCLUSIVELY FOUND SOME OF THE HIGHER FUNG-, IN THE HIGHER FUNGI,
###142 LIKE THE ASCOMYCOTA, BASIDIOMYCOTA, THOSE TWO GROUPS, WHERE WE
###146 HAD TWO HAPLOID NUCLEI IN THE SAME CELLULAR PARTITION. SO
###151 THAT'S SORT OF AN ANOMALY FOR THE FUNGI. AND WE WON'T BE SEEING
###155 THAT ANY LONGER. NOW IN ALL THE LAND PLANTS  -- AND I ALSO
###161 MENTIONED IN THE SEA LETTUCE, THE ULVA, ONE OF THE GREEN ALGAE,
###166 WHICH HAS INDEPENDENTLY EVOLVED THIS LIFE CYCLE FROM THE LAND
###169 PLANTS -- WE HAVE MULTICELLULAR GENERATIONS THAT ARE BOTH DIPLOID
###173 AND HAPLOID. SO WE HAVE THIS ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS BETWEEN
###178 DIPLOID AND HAPLOID MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS OF SAME SPECIES.
###184 AND SO JUST TO RECAP IT HERE IN IT'S, IN THE ACTUAL CYCLE FORMAT
###188 HERE YOU CAN SEE A MULTICELLULAR HAPLOID ORGANISM WHICH WE CALL
###193 THE GAMETE PRODUCING PLANT OR THE GAMETOPHYTE. SO THE HAPLOID
###198 GENERATION PRODUCES THE GAMETES, OKAY, BY MITOSIS BECAUSE THEY'RE
###202 ALREADY HAPLOID. THE GAMETES THEN FUSE TOGETHER TO FORM THE
###209 ZYGOTE. AND THEN WE HAVE MITOSES THAT FORM A MULTICELLULAR
###214 DIPLOID ORGANISM. REMEMBER THE ZYGOTE'S DIPLOID OBVIOUSLY. WE
###218 HAD A MULTICELLULAR DIPLOID ORGANISM THAT'S ALWAYS CALLED THE
###222 
###222 SPOROPHYTE, WHICH IS THE SPORE-PRODUCING PLANT. PHYTE JUST MEANS
###226 PLANT. AND THEN WE HAVE MEIOSIS OCCURING TO PRODUCE SPORES, SO
###232 WE GO FROM DIPLOID TO HAPLOID HERE IN MEIOSIS. AND THEN MITOSES
###236 TO GIVE US ANOTHER MULTICELLULAR HAPLOID ORGANISM. SO IT JUST
###239 GOES BACK AND FORTH OR IT GOES AROUND AND AROUND HERE BETWEEN THE
###243 DIPOLID AND THE HAPLOID ORGANISMS. AND THE STRUCTURES WHERE THE
###248 GAMETES ARE BORN ON THE GAMETOPHYTE ARE CALLED GAMETANGIA.
###252 THOSE ARE JUST HOLLOW SAC-LIKE, SAC-SHAPED STRUCTURES THAT BEAR
###256 GAMETES. AND SIMILARLY IN THE SPOROPHYTE THE STRUCTURE THAT
###261 BEARS THE SPORES WHERE MEIOSIS OCCURS IS CALLED THE SPORANGIUM.
###267 SO THOSE ARE REALLY SIMPLE CLEAR STEPS. AND THEY'RE CONSISTENT
###272 THROUGHOUT THE LAND PLANTS. BUT THERE'S ELABORATION IN THESE
###276 THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO, YOU NEED TO HAVE THIS DOWN IN TERMS OF
###281 THE MAIN STEPS IN THIS ALTERNATION BETWEEN THESE STEPS TO REALLY
###286 UNDERSTAND THESE SUBSEQUENT LIFE CYCLES. SO PLEASE AS I
###290 MENTIONED EARLIER, TRY TO EMBRACE THIS AND MEMORIZE IT AS SOON AS
###292 POSSIBLE AND IT'LL HELP YOU A LOT. OKAY SO NOW WE ALREADY
###299 TALKED ABOUT HOW THE, THE LAND PLANTS ARE A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP.
###304 SO THE LAND PLANTS APPEAR TO HAVE EVOLVED FROM, ALL THE MODERN
###307 LAND PLANTS AND SOME LAND PLANTS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY GONE BACK TO
###311 AQUATIC SITUATIONS OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL, THOSE ARE A
###314 MONOPHYLETIC GROUP THAT DESCEND FROM PART OF THE GREEN ALGAE.
###319 SO THE ORGANISMS WE WERE CALLING GREEN ALGAE EARLIER ARE ACTUALLY
###323 PARAPHYLETIC, THAT IS SOME GREEN ALGAE ARE MORE CLOSELY RELATED
###329 TO LAND PLANTS THAN THEY ARE TO THE OTHER GREEN ALGAE. SO THESE
###332 
###332 ARE THE BASE OF TREE HERE. THESE ARE THE ANCESTRAL, THE
###337 ANCESTORS OF THIS GROUP AND THE TIPS HERE, SO YOU CAN SEE THAT
###342 THE, THE MOST RECENT COMMON ANCESTOR HERE OF ALL THE GREEN ALGAE
###347 IS ALSO SHARED WITH THE LAND PLANTS. SO THE TERM GREEN PLANT
###353 HAS COME TO BE USED FOR ALL OF THE GREEN ORGANISMS, INCLUDING THE
###357 LAND PLANTS SINCE WE KNOW NOW THAT THE GREEN ALGAE DON'T
###361 CONSTITUTE A NATURAL GROUP WITHOUT INCLUDING THE LAND PLANTS.
###366 OKAY, AND SO THE CLOSEST RELATIVES OF THE LAND PLANTS ARE
###369 FRESHWATER GREEN ALGAE, NOT SALTWATER GREEN ALGAE. SO THE
###374 COLONIZATION OF LAND HAPPENED NOT DIRECTLY FROM THE OCEAN OR FROM
###379 MARINE SITUATIONS TO LAND BUT WITH AN INTERMEDIARY STEP INTO
###383 FRESHWATER BEFORE COLONIZATION OF LAND. SO THAT'S, THAT'S
###387 SOMETHING THAT'S BECOME WELL-RECOGNIZED NOW WITH A LOT OF RECENT
###391 EVIDENCE, BOTH MORPHOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR. OKAY. THOUGH THESE
###401 ARE THE SEVEN MAJOR GROUPS OF LAND PLANTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO
###405 FOCUS ON IN THIS COURSE. THERE ARE OTHERS BUT THESE ARE THE
###408 SEVEN MAJOR LINEAGES OR CLADES. AND HERE'S THE MOST RECENT
###413 COMMON ANCESTOR OF ALL OF THE, THE LAND PLANTS NOW EXTINCT. AND
###419 YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS, BASED ON MOLECULAR AND FOSSIL DATA, WE
###423 THINK THIS IS BACK IN THE EARLY PALEOZOIC, SO RIGHT AROUND THE
###429 TIME WE HAVE A LOT OF MULTICELLULAR LIFE EVOLVING. WE HAVE THE
###434 LAND PLANTS EVOLVING. AND THEN ABOUT 50 MILLION YEARS LATER WE
###440 GET THE ORIGIN OF THE VASCULAR PLANTS WHICH ARE THESE FOUR MAJOR
###444 LINEAGES THAT I'LL GET TO IN A MOMENT. BUT THESE ARE THE ONES
###447 THAT HAVE RIGID CONDUCTING TISSUES, AND THEY'RE SPOROPHYTES THAT
###450 
###450 ALLOWS THEM TO GET TO VERY LARGE SIZES AND HAVE BRANCHING,
###456 BRANCHING GROWTH FOR THE SPOROPHYTE. SO THE GROUPS LIKE THE
###459 SEED PLANTS, THE FERNS AND RELATIVES AND THE LYCOPHYTES THAT I'LL
###463 MENTION WHICH HAVE OFTEN BEEN CALLED FERN ALLIES, THESE ARE ALL
###466 THE VASCULAR PLANTS THAT HAVE THE MAJOR CONDUCTING TISSUE. THEY
###470 HAVE ROOTS. THEY HAVE A LOT OF FEATURES THAT, THICK CUTICLES OR
###474 WAXY COVERING ON THEIR PLANT BODY THAT ALLOWS THEM TO WITHSTAND
###479 DROUGHT. SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF FEATURES THAT MAKE THEM WELL
###482 ADAPTED TO LAND. YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE THESE OTHER THREE
###486 GROUPS HERE, THE MOSSES, THE HORNWORTS, AND THE LIVERWORTS THAT I
###491 STARTED TO INTRODUCE LAST TIME WHICH ARE NOT A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP
###495 BY A BASAL GRADE HERE WITHIN THE LAND PLANTS. SO YOU CAN SEE
###502 HOW THEY BRANCH OFF IN A SEQUENTIAL FASHION HERE. THEY DON'T,
###506 THE MOST RECENT COMMON ANCESTOR OF ALL THE BRYOPHYTES IS ALSO
###510 SHARED WITH THE VASCULAR PLANTS. AND THE VASCULAR PLANTS ARE
###514 MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO SOME BRYOPHYTES THAN TO OTHERS. AND THE
###519 INTERESTING THING HERE IS THE BRYOPHYTES HAVE LONG BEEN
###521 CONSIDERED A NATURAL GROUP BUT IN FACT THEY'RE ACTUALLY A GRADE,
###526 A PARAPHYLETIC GROUP. SO THE FEATURES THAT THEY SHARE IN COMMON
###530 THAT LEAD TO THEM BEING CALLED A GROUP OF PLANTS, THE BRYOPHYTES,
###533 GIVEN THAT THEY'RE PARAPHYLETIC, WE'D INFER THAT THOSE FEATURES
###539 WERE FOUND IN THE COMMON ANCESTOR OF ALL THE LAND PLANTS,
###542 INCLUDING THE VASCULAR PLANTS, OKAY. SO UNDERSTANDING OF
###547 BRYOPHYTES REALLY ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND THE ANCESTOR OF ALL THE
###551 LAND PLANTS, THE MOST RECENT COMMON ANCESTOR. SO THAT'S A REALLY
###556 
###556 IMPORTANT FINDING. AND THIS WAS DISCOVERED BACK IN THE 1980S,
###559 BASED ON MORPHOLOGY. ACTUALLY BRENT MISHLER IS ONE OF THE
###563 FACULTY IN IB, MADE THAT DISCOVERY INITIALLY, AND IT'S BEEN
###566 REINFORCED WITH MOLECULAR DATA. THE PRECISE BRANCHING ORDER OF
###570 THESE THREE MAJOR GROUPS IS A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR STILL, BUT IT'S
###575 PRETTY CLEAR THAT THEY ARE PARAPHYLETIC AND THAT THE LIVERWORTS
###579 SHOWN HERE ARE THE EARLIEST LINEAGE TO BRANCH OFF AND ARE SISTER
###582 TO ALL THE OTHER LAND PLANTS. SO ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT
###588 THAT? OKAY. SO ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN WE LOOK TO THE
###596 BRYOPHYTES THAT YOU SEE RIGHT AWAY IS THEY HAVE SOME INTERESTING
###599 FEATURES THAT MAKE THEM PRETTY WELL ADAPTED TO LAND. I MEAN
###602 THEY'RE A VERY SUCCESSFUL GROUP. YOU FIND THEM ON ALL THE
###605 CONTINENTS. AND THEY OCCUR IN A WIDE VARIETY OF HABITATS,
###609 TEMPERATE AND TROPICAL. ONE THING YOU SEE IS THAT THEIR SPORES
###615 ARE RESISTANT TO DESICCATION TO SOME EXTENT, THAT IS THEY DON'T
###617 DRY OUT READILY. SO THEY CAN DISPERSE SPORES AND THE SPORES CAN
###622 TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES AND WITHSTAND SOME ENVIRONMENTAL EXTREMES.
###626 BUT ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS ABOUT THE BRYOPHYTES AND SOMETHING
###629 THAT'S ONLY BECOME REALLY APPRECIATED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS,
###633 WELL, IT'S BEEN KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME BUT IT'S BEEN STUDIED MORE
###636 INTENSIVELY, IS THAT EVEN THEIR MAIN BODY, THEIR, THE MAIN PLANT
###641 BODY, THE GAMETOPHYTE IN THIS CASE -- WE'LL GET TO THE LIFE CYCLE
###645 IN A MOMENT -- IS DESICCATION TOLERANT. AND SO NOT ONLY CAN THE
###652 SPORES WITHSTAND DESICCATION BUT THE ACTUAL VEGETATIVE BODY OF
###656 THE PLANT CAN DRY OUT ESSENTIALLY COMPLETELY AND THE BRYOPHYTES
###661 
###661 THAT AT LEAST OCCUR IN SEASONALLY DRY ENVIRONMENTS OR PERENNIALLY
###665 PRETTY DRY ENVIRONMENTS. AND THEY LOOK FOR ALL PRACTICAL
###669 PURPOSES TO BE LIFELESS WHEN THEY'RE IN THAT STATE. YOU CAN'T
###672 DETECT ANY METABOLIC ACTIVITY. BUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ADD
###676 WATER AND THEY'RE RIGHT BACK, THEY REHYDRATE VERY, VERY QUICKLY.
###682 AND THEY'RE PHOTOSYNTHESIZING AGAIN IN NO TIME. SO THIS IS
###687 SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN REALLY INTERESTING. AND A LOT OF CROP
###690 SCIENTISTS, FOR EXAMPLE, REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS AND SEE
###693 IF THEY CAN GET GENES FROM BRYOPHYTES INTO CROPS BECAUSE THE
###697 VASCULAR PLANTS, AS SUCCESSFUL AS THEY'VE BEEN ON LAND, MOSTLY
###701 DON'T HAVE THIS CAPABILITY. THEY HAVE A LOT OF WAYS OF
###704 PREVENTING THEMSELVES FROM DRYING OUT. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE GREAT
###707 CONDUCTING TISSUE AND ROOT SYSTEMS, THICK CUTICLES, THESE WAXY
###711 COVERINGS, BUT ONCE THEY ACTUALLY DO DRY OUT, MOST OF THEM ARE
###716 TOAST. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO REVIVE. THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL,
###719 AND I'LL SHOW YOU A COUPLE. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE
###723 BRYOPHYTES HAVE DOWN. THEY DON'T HAVE ROOT SYSTEMS. THEY DON'T
###727 HAVE, YOU KNOW, DESICCATION RESISTANT LEAVES, BUT THEY SURVIVE
###730 DESICCATION OR DRYING OUT REALLY WELL. OKAY, SO THE LIFE CYCLE
###736 OF BRYOPHYTES IS INTERESTING. AND REMEMBER THAT THE CLOSEST
###744 RELATIVES OF THE LAND PLANTS ARE ALGAE THAT DIDN'T HAVE AN
###748 ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS. THEY JUST HAD A HAPLOID ORGANISM
###753 AND THE ONLY DIPLOID STAGE WAS THE ZYGOTE. NOW WHAT YOU SEE IN
###758 THE BRYOPHYTES AND PRESUMABLY THE ANCESTOR OF ALL THE MODERN LAND
###762 PLANTS IS THAT THE DOMINANT GENERATION IS THE GAMETOPHYTE, THE
###767 
###767 HAPLOID GENERATION, WHICH MAKES A LOT OF SENSE CONSIDERING THAT
###771 THEIR CLOSEST RELATIVES ONLY HAD A HAPLOID GENERATION. THESE
###775 HAVE A DOMINANT HAPLOID GENERATION. AND THE SPOROPHYTE
###779 GENERATION WHICH IS SHOWN HERE IN THIS PINK PART OF THE LIFE
###782 CYCLE IS A PARASITE ON THE GAMETOPHYTE, ON THE MATERNAL
###787 GAMETOPHYTE. SO THE SPOROPHYTE IS AN EXTREMELY SMALL AND
###792 EPHEMERAL TYPICALLY PRETTY SHORT-LIVED ORGANISM THAT'S PARASITIC
###797 ON THE MORE LONG, TYPICALLY MORE, OFTEN MORE LONG-LIVED
###799 GAMETOPHYTE. AND IT BASICALLY IS PRETTY MUCH AN ORGANISM THAT
###805 PRODUCES SPORES BY MEIOSIS AND IT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT MORE GOING
###809 FOR IT. IT'S, IT'S BEEN INTERJECTED INTO THIS LIFE CYCLE. I
###814 MEAN WE KNOW THAT THE, THAT A HAPLOID ORGANISM WITHOUT A DIPLOID
###820 GENERATION WAS ANCESTRAL TO ALL THE LAND PLANTS. AND WE
###823 BASICALLY HAD THE INTERJECTION OF A SPOROPHYTE GENERATION HERE
###827 THAT IS PARASITIC ON THE GAMETOPHYTE. OKAY, SO THE SPOROPHYTE
###832 DOES PRODUCE SPORES. AND THESE SPORES AS I MENTIONED ARE
###836 SOMEWHAT RESISTANT TO DESICCATION. THEY'RE COVERED WITH A
###839 SUBSTANCE CALLED SPOROPOLLENIN THAT MAKES THEM RESISTANT. AND IT
###842 ALSO IS PRESENT IN THE ZYGOTES OF THE CLOSELY RELATED GREEN
###847 ALGAE, THE CHAROPHYTES. BUT IT'S, THESE ARE LAND DISPERSED
###851 SPORES. AND THEY GERMINATE. MITOSES OCCUR. WE GET A
###856 FILAMENOUS GAMETOPHYTE INITIALLY IN THIS MOSSES. THIS IS A MOSS
###862 LIFE CYCLE HERE. AND EVENTUALLY WE GET THE MATURE GAMETOPHYTES
###867 FORMING WHICH LOOK LEAFY. AND AT THEIR APEX WE HAVE GAMETANGIA
###872 PRODUCED. REMEMBER THESE ARE THE SAC-LIKE STRUCTURES THAT BEAR
###876 
###876 THE GAMETES ON GAMETOPHYTES. AND IN A LOT OF MOSSES LIKE THE ONE
###881 REPRESENTED HERE, WE HAVE UNISEXUAL GAMETOPHYTES. THERE ARE TWO
###885 DIFFERENT TYPES OF GAMETOPHYTES, ONE THAT PRODUCES SPERM, ONE
###889 THAT PRODUCES EGGS. BUT SOME OF, SOME OF THE MOSSES HAVE
###893 BISEXUAL GAMETOPHYTES OR HERMAPHRODITIC GAMETOPHYTES THAT PRODUCE
###897 BOTH GAMET-, BOTH TYPES OF GAMETANGIA. AND WE CALL THOSE
###902 ANTHERIDIA. SINGULAR WOULD BE THE ANTHERIDIUM WHICH PRODUCES
###907 THE SPERM. AND THE ARCHEGONIA OR THE ARCHEGONIUM IS SINGULAR,
###911 THAT'S THE TYPE OF GAMETANGIA THAT PRODUCES AN EGG. AND SO ONE
###917 OF THINGS THAT PRETTY MUCH LOCKS THE MOSSES INTO AT LEAST
###922 SEASONALLY WET ENVIRONMENTS TO SOME EXTENT IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE
###926 SEXUALLY REPRODUCING IS THAT THEY HAVE FREE-SWIMMING SPERM. AND
###931 THE SPERM HAS TO LEAVE THE ANTHERIDIUM AND SWIM TO THE NECK OF
###936 THE ARCHEGONIUM AND SWIM DOWN THE CANAL OF THE ARCHEGONIUM WHICH
###941 IS THE FLASK-SHAPED GAMETANGIUM WITH AN OPENING AT THE TIP AND
###945 THEN A LONG NECK. AND THEN AT THE BASE IT'S SWOLLEN AND THERE'S
###947 AN EGG THERE. THAT'S A TYPICAL SHAPE OF AN ARCHEGONIUM. AND
###953 THE SPERM HAVE TO SWIM DOWN THERE TO FERTILIZE THE EGG. BUT NOT
###957 ONLY DOES THE FEMALE GAMETANGIUM PRODUCE A GAMETE, THE EGG, BUT
###962 IT'S ALSO WHERE FERTILIZATION OCCURS AND WHERE THE EMBRYO
###966 DEVELOPS. SO IT'S ANALOGOUS IN A LOT OF WAYS TO FEMALE
###972 REPRODUCTIVE TRACKS IN ANIMALS, BUT IT'S COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT
###975 EVOLUTION OF THOSE, OF THESE FEATURES. AND SO WE SEE A
###981 FERTILIZATION OCCURRING HERE. THE ZYGOTE DOWN AT THE BASE OF
###985 THE ARCHEGONIUM, DIPLOID NOW. AND THEN THIS UNDERGOES MITOSES
###991 
###991 TO FORM AN EMBRYO. NOW AN EMBRYO IN PLANTS BASICALLY JUST
###995 REFERS TO AN IMMATURE SPOROPHYTE THAT'S AT THE STAGE WHERE THERE
###1000 CAN BE A RESTING STAGE. AND IT'S ELABORATED TO A GREATER OR
###1005 LESSER EXTENT IN DIFFERENT GROUPS OF LAND PLANTS. BUT THEY ALL
###1009 HAVE EMBRYOS. AND SO ALL THE LAND PLANTS, THAT IS THE
###1012 BRYOPHYTES PLUS THE VASCULAR PLANTS ARE OFTEN CALLED EMBRYOPHYTES
###1017 OR EMBRYO-PRODUCING PLANTS. AND THE EMBRYO BECOMES REALLY
###1021 IMPORTANT WHEN WE GET TO THE SEED PLANTS. TALK ABOUT THEM
###1024 SHORTLY. BUT HERE'S THE YOUNG SPOROPHYTE THEN DEVELOPING. AND
###1029 AS I MENTIONED, IT'S PARASITIC ON THE GAMETOPHYTE, THE MATERNAL
###1032 GAMETOPHYTE. SO IT HAS A FOOT HERE, WHAT THEY CALL A FOOT
###1037 THAT'S, IT'S ACTUALLY EMBEDDED IN THE TIP OF THE GAMETANGIUM OR
###1041 IN THE TIP OF THE GAMETOPHYTE HERE. AND IT ALSO HAS A STALK AND
###1045 MOSSES WHICH WE CALL THE SETA. AND AT THE TIP OF IT IS
###1049 BASICALLY JUST THE SPORANGIUM, WHICH IS SOME, WHICH THE MOSS
###1053 SPECIALISTS, THE BRYOLOGISTS CALL A CAPSULE. AND HERE YOU CAN
###1058 SEE THE SPORANGIUM OR THE CAPSULE MAGNIFIED. AND HERE YOU CAN
###1063 SEE THE TIP OF IT MAGNIFIED USING SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY TO
###1068 SHOW THIS ELABORATE STRUCTURE AT THE TIP CALLED A PERISTOME.
###1072 AND THE MAIN POINT HERE IS THAT THE MOSSES CAN REGULATE THEIR
###1075 SPORE DISPERSAL BY MEANS OF THIS SPECIALIZED STRUCTURE THAT
###1080 RESPONDS TO ATMOSPHERIC HUMIDITY SUCH THAT SPORES WILL TEND TO BE
###1085 RELEASED WHEN IT'S DRY OUT. SO IT'S MORE EASY TO DISPERSE
###1089 SPORES INTO THE ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM AWAY FROM THE PARENT
###1093 GAMETOPHYTE OR AND THE PARENT SPOROPHYTE HERE IF, IF IT'S DRY, IF
###1099 
###1099 WE HAVE DRY, A DRY CLIMATE. AND UNDER WET CONDITIONS IT WOULD BE
###1103 ENCLOSED. SO THE SPORES HAVE SOME, SOME REGULATION OF THEIR
###1108 SPORE DISPERSAL THAT'S A NICE ADAPTATION TO LAND. WE DON'T SEE
###1112 THIS STRUCTURE IN THE LIVERWORTS OR THE HORNWORTS, THE OTHER TWO
###1116 GROUPS OF BRYOPHYTES. ALSO SOME OF THE MOSSES HAVE THE ABILITY
###1121 TO CONDUCT WATER AND NUTRIENTS IN THEIR TISSUES BY MEANS OF
###1128 SPECIALIZED CONDUCTING CELLS THAT DON'T APPEAR TO BE HOMOLOGOUS
###1133 WITH THOSE IN VASCULAR PLANTS. AND THEY'RE NOT STRONGLY
###1136 REINFORCED STRUCTURALLY SO THEY DON'T ALLOW MOSSES TO GET VERY
###1140 LARGE. THE LARGEST BRYOPHYTES ARE TYPICALLY ONLY ABOUT
###1143 15 CENTIMETERS TALL, SO UNDER A FOOT TALL. NOT VERY BIG PLANTS.
###1149 SOME OF THE MOSSES CAN GET UP TO A COUPLE OF METERS TALL, BUT
###1152 THOSE ARE REAL EXCEPTIONS. OKAY, SO JUST TO, SO ARE THERE
###1158 QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LIFE CYCLE OF BRYOPHYTES? OR SOME OF THESE?
###1164 YEAH?
###1165 STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].
###1167 PROFESSOR: YEAH, THEY HAVE A SIMILAR LIFE CYCLE. IN THE
###1172 LIVERWORTS, THERE ARE SOME LEAFY LIVERWORTS THAT HAVE THIS KIND
###1175 OF LEAFY APPEARANCE. THE LIFE CYCLE'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
###1179 EXCEPT THAT MOST OF THE LIVERWORTS AND HORNWORTS DON'T HAVE AN
###1183 ELONGATED STALK THAT BEARS THE CAPSULE. SO THE MOSSES GET THEIR
###1187 CAPSULE UP AWAY FROM THE GAMETOPHYTE PRETTY WELL. AND SOME OF
###1193 THE LIVERWORTS DO ACTUALLY HAVE A STALK, BUT THEY, THEY
###1196 BASICALLY, WHEN THE SPORES ARE READY TO DISPERSE, THE CAPSULE
###1199 JUST COMPLETELY OPENS UP AND ALL THE SPORES ARE RELEASED. THEY
###1202 
###1202 DON'T HAVE THIS REGULATION OF SPORE DISPERSAL. BUT THE GENERAL
###1206 STEPS OF THE CYCLE ARE THE SAME. THE GAMETOPHYTE IS DOMINANT.
###1210 AND THE SPOROPHYTE, IF ANYTHING, IS EVEN LESS CONSPICIOUS. AND
###1214 THE LIVERWORTS DEFINITELY. I'LL SHOW YOU A HORNWORT SPOROPHYTE
###1218 IN A MOMENT. THOUGH HERE ARE THE THREE MAJOR GROUPS OF
###1223 BRYOPHYTES JUST BRIEFLY. THE MOSSES, AGAIN WORLDWIDE, ABOUT
###1229 9,000 SPECIES, REALLY PRETTY DIVERSE. PROBABLY A LOT MORE
###1234 SPECIES THAN ARE RECOGNIZED BECAUSE MOSSES SEEM TO EVOLVE FAIRLY
###1240 QUICKLY. I MEAN, I SHOULD SAY THEIR MORPHOLOGY EVOLVES REALLY
###1244 SLOWLY BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY'RE SPECIATING OR DIVERSIFYING
###1248 MUCH MORE RAPIDLY THAN THEY'RE CHANGING IN CONSPICUOUS WAYS
###1251 MORPHOLOGICALLY AND THAT'S CLEAR FROM MOLECULAR DATA. SO
###1255 THEY'RE PROBABLY A MORE DIVERSE GROUP THAN WE RECOGNIZE. BUT
###1258 THEY HAVE THIS GREEN GAMETOPHYTE. IT DOESN'T LOOK VERY GREEN IN
###1262 THIS SHOT BUT THE, TRUST ME, THESE ARE PHYTOSYNTHETIC, THIS
###1265 DARKER AREA. HERE YOU CAN SEE A SHOOT, A GAMETOPHYTE HERE
###1271 THAT'S GREEN. AND HERE'S THE SPOROPHYTE WITH THE LONG SETA
###1276 EMBEDDED IN THE TIP OF THE GAMETOPHYTE. THE SPORANGIUM OR
###1280 CAPSULE, AND THERE'S THE LITTLE PERISTOME AT THE TIP THAT
###1283 REGULATES SPORE DISPERSAL. OKAY, NOW THE LIVERWORTS ARE, THERE
###1290 ARE ABOUT 6,000 SPECIES RECOGNIZED. IT'S STILL A PRETTY DIVERSE
###1294 GROUP. ALSO FOUND WORLDWIDE. AND THEY HAVE A VARIETY OF
###1298 DIFFERENT FORMS. THE ONES YOU MOST COMMONLY ENCOUNTER, AND ARE
###1303 EASILY RECOGNIZABLE IS LIVERWORTS, HAVE THESE WHAT ARE CALLED
###1306 PHALLOID BODIES WHICH ARE BASICALLY JUST FLATTENED BODIES THAT
###1309 
###1309 LIE FLAT ON SUBSTRATE LIKE SOIL AND CAN BECOME LOBED LIKE THIS.
###1317 AND THE, AS I MENTIONED, THE SPOROPHYTE IS PRETTY MUCH EMBEDDED
###1321 USUALLY INSIDE THE GAMETOPHYTE, ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES ON A STALK.
###1326 BUT THE STALK IS PRETTY FRAGILE BY COMPARISON WITH THE ONE THAT
###1329 WE DID IN MOSSES IF THERE IS ONE. AND THE HORNWORTS ARE A
###1336 PRETTY LOW DIVERSITY GROUP. THERE ARE JUST A COUPLE HUNDRED
###1338 SPECIES OF THESE. AND THEY ALSO HAVE A PHALLOID BODY LIKE SOME
###1344 OF THE LIVERWORTS THAT'S JUST BASICALLY LYING FLAT ON SUBSTRATE.
###1348 AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THE SPOROPHYTES OF HORNWORTS WHICH ARE
###1354 PHOTOSYNTHETIC. AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE STOMATA WHICH ARE PORES
###1358 THAT REGULATE GAS EXCHANGE WHICH IS INTERESTING. AND THEY ALSO
###1362 HAVE BASICALLY THIS WHOLE ELONGATED HORN-SHAPED STRUCTURE, WHICH
###1367 IS THE BASIS OF THE NAME HORNWORT, IS A CAPSULE. IT'S JUST AN
###1371 ELONGATED SPORANGIUM. IT DOESN'T HAVE A STALK. IT SPLITS OPEN
###1375 AT MATURITY. AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE HORNWORTS ARE THE
###1378 CLOSEST RELATIVES OF THE VASCULAR PLANTS OR THE MOSSES. THERE'S
###1384 SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THAT. BUT ANYWAYS, THERE'S SOME
###1390 CONSIDERABLE DIVERSITY IN THE BRYOPHYTES. AND THESE THREE
###1395 GROUPS ARE DEFINITELY NATURAL GROUPS. AND WORT, YOU'LL SEE THE
###1399 NAME WORT USED A LOT IN BOTANY. IT'S JUST AN ARCHAIC TERM FOR
###1403 AN HERB, BASICALLY A NON-WOODY PLANT. SO THAT'S WHAT THE BASIS
###1407 FOR WORT IS. OKAY, SO THOSE ARE THE THREE MAJOR GROUPS OF
###1413 BRYOPHYTES. AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT THEY BEGAN TO DIVERSIFY
###1417 FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR, OOPS, PRIOR TO THE ORIGIN OF THE VASCULAR
###1424 PLANTS. REMEMBER THEY'RE A PARAPHYLETIC GROUP. ALL RIGHT, SO
###1429 
###1430 ECONOMICALLY AND ECOLOGICALLY THE MOSSES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT.
###1433 AND ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T PRODUCE FOOD ITEMS LIKE VASCULAR PLANTS
###1440 FOR US, THEY ARE IMPORTANT IN MANY WAYS. SOME OF THE MOST
###1444 CONSPICUOUSLY IMPORTANT MOSSES -- AND MOSSES ARE WHERE WE FIND A
###1449 LOT OF ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT BRYOPHYTES -- ARE THE PEAT MOSSES,
###1453 MEMBERS OF THE GENUS SPHAGNUM. IT'S A VERY DISTINCTIVE MOSS
###1457 GROUP. AND THESE ARE OFTEN FOUND IN BOGGY ENVIRONMENTS,
###1461 SATURATING ENVIRONMENTS. AND THEY IMPART ACIDITY, LOW PH, AND
###1469 CERTAIN CHEMICAL PROPERTIES TO THESE BOGS DUE TO THESE PHENOLIC
###1472 COMPOUNDS THEY PRODUCE THAT RESULT IN VERY LOW RATES OF
###1478 DECOMPOSITION IN THESE BOG ENVIRONMENTS. AND SO THE CARBON
###1482 THAT'S FIXED BY THE, BY THE, BY THE PEAT MOSS AND OTHER
###1488 PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS IN THESE SITUATIONS, IN THESE
###1491 ENVIRONMENTS WILL TEND NOT TO DECAY RAPIDLY AND WILL TEND TO BE
###1497 DEPOSITED AND REMAIN IN THE SOIL ENVIRONMENT OR REMAIN, RAIN OUT
###1501 OF THE ATMOSPHERE. AND SO BRYOPHYTES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR
###1506 FIXING CARBON AND KEEPING IT OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE. AND
###1511 UNFORTUNATELY NOW, WELL, THE PEAT HAS ACCUMULATED OVER THE AGES
###1515 TO SUCH AN EXTENT, ESPECIALLY IN SOME NORTHERN CLIMATES WHERE WE
###1518 HAVE COOL TEMPERATURES AND ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS  -- THAT'S
###1520 TYPICALLY WHERE WE FIND SPHAGNUM ARE IN COOL ENVIRONMENTS -- THAT
###1526 NOW THIS IS BEING EXTENSIVELY USED AS FUEL. AND HERE YOU CAN
###1530 SEE, THIS IS ONE OF THESE INDUSTRIAL PEAT HARVESTING OPERATIONS
###1533 IN THE U.K. AND SO A LOT OF THIS CARBON IS BEING RETURNED BACK TO
###1537 THE ATMOSPHERE. BUT EVEN MORE DISCONCERTING IS THAT A LOT OF THE
###1541 
###1541 PEAT THAT'S BEEN DEPOSITED IN SOILS OVER THE YEARS, A LOT OF
###1547 THESE PEAT ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE STILL INTACT IN NORTHERN
###1551 CLIMATES ARE STARTING TO DRY OUT WITH GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE AND
###1556 RATES OF RESPIRATION ARE INCREASING AND THIS CARBON'S BEING
###1559 RETURNED TO THE ATMOSPHERE. SO THERE'S A REAL CONCERN ABOUT,
###1564 ABOUT SOME POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS THAT MIGHT RESULT IN A LOT OF
###1568 CARBON RETURNING TO THE ATMOSPHERE FROM THESE KINDS OF
###1570 ENVIRONMENTS. IN ANY CASE PEAT MOSS IS ALSO USEFUL
###1574 ECONOMICALLY. IT'S, HOLDS WATER REALLY WELL. AND THE ACIDITY
###1579 OF IT, AND AS I MENTIONED THESE PHENOLICS, MAKE IT AN
###1583 ANTIMICROBIAL ENVIRONMENT THAT'S GOOD FOR, SAY, WRAPPING UP PLANT
###1586 CUTTINGS OR ROOTS FOR SHIPMENT. IT'S ALSO GOOD AS A SOIL
###1591 CONDITIONER, ET CETERA. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF USES FOR PEAT
###1595 MOSS. THERE ARE SOME MOSSES TOO THAT ARE MEDICINALLY IMPORTANT.
###1598 IT'S A MINORITY, BUT IN SOME ASIAN MEDICINAL TRADITIONS THERE ARE
###1603 SOME USEFUL MOSES THAT ARE BEING ACTIVELY STUDIED. NOW ANOTHER
###1608 REALLY THING IMPORTANT SCIENTIFICALLY ABOUT THESE PEAT BOG
###1612 ENVIRONMENTS AND BOGGY ENVIRONMENTS IN GENERAL IS THAT THEIR
###1616 ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS -- THE LACK OF OXYGEN, THE COOL ENVIRONMENT,
###1620 THE LOW PH -- HAS NOT ONLY LEAD TO THESE BIG CARBON DEPOSITS BUT
###1625 ALSO PRESERVATION OF FOSSILS. AND A LOT OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT
###1630 THE LAST SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS OF HISTORY FROM THE FOSSIL
###1634 PERSPECTIVE COMES FROM THESE KINDS OF ENVIRONMENTS. AND NOT
###1639 ONLY PLANT REMAINS ARE PRESERVED IN THESE SITUATIONS BUT ALSO
###1643 ANIMAL REMAINS ARE WELL PRESERVED, INCLUDING HUMAN REMAINS. AND
###1649 
###1649 IN NORTHERN EUROPE, THERE ARE THESE SO-CALLED "BOG PEOPLE" THAT
###1653 HAVE BEEN EXCAVATED, USUALLY INADVERTENTLY FROM BOG ENVIRONMENTS.
###1658 AND SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS LIKE THIS ONE LOOK LIKE THEY'RE
###1660 SLEEPING. THEY SHOW NO DECOMPOSITION. YOU CAN MAKE OUT THEIR
###1664 FACIAL FEATURES PERFECTLY. AND THEY'RE BASICALLY JUST DEEPLY
###1668 STAINED BY THE PHENOLICS. THIS IS A LEVEL OF PRESERVATION FOR
###1672 CORPSES THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD THAT YOU CAN'T SEE IN ANY OTHER
###1675 CONDITIONS, ANY OTHER SITUATIONS. THERE'S OVER A THOUSAND OF
###1679 THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND. AND YOU CAN SEE THE ROPE
###1681 AROUND THIS PERSON'S NECK. THESE PEOPLE ALMOST INADVERTENTLY, I
###1687 MEAN ALMOST ALWAYS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN EXECUTED. AND THEY MAY
###1692 HAVE BEEN RITUAL SACRIFICES. THEY MAY HAVE BEEN EXECUTED
###1696 CRIMINALS. IT'S UNCLEAR BUT IN ANY CASE THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN
###1700 BE LEARNED ABOUT. THESE ACTUALLY DATE BACK TO THE IRON AGE, SO
###1704 THERE'S A LOT OF IMPORTANT HUMAN REMAINS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND IN
###1707 THESE SITUATIONS FOR ARCHEOLOGISTS. OKAY. SO ALSO ANOTHER
###1716 THING THAT PEAT MOSS USED TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR, HERE YOU
###1719 CAN SEE SPHAGNUM MOSS FOR THE WOUNDED ON THE FRONT BEING
###1724 HARVESTED UP IN CANADA, BRITISH COLUMBIA, IN PRINCE RUPERT.
###1728 PEAT MOSS WAS EXTENSIVELY COLLECTED AND SHIPPED TO THE FRONT
###1731 DURING WORLD WAR I TO USE AS STERILE BANDAGING FOR SOLDIERS THAT
###1737 WERE INVOLVED IN TRENCH WARFARE IN THESE REALLY UNSANITARY
###1741 CONDITIONS. AND IT SAVED A LOT OF LIVES AT A TIME WHEN
###1746 ANTIBIOTICS, PENICILLIN IN PARTICULAR, WASN'T AVAILABLE. THOUGH
###1753 THAT'S NOT SUCH A COMMON USE ANYMORE OF COURSE, BUT THAT'S AN
###1756 
###1756 INTERESTING HISTORICAL FOOTNOTE. OKAY, SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO
###1760 MOVE ON TO VASCULAR PLANTS, WHICH AS I MENTIONED THESE ARE THE
###1764 ORGANISMS THAT DOMINATE THE TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENT TODAY AND
###1769 THAT HAVE EXTENSIVE CONDUCTING TISSUE TO CONDUCT BOTH WATER AND
###1776 NUTRIENTS IN THEIR PLANT BODY. THEY ALSO HAVE WELL-DEVELOPED
###1783 ROOT SYSTEMS FOR CONDUCTING WATER AND WELL-DEVELOPED CUTICLES,
###1788 THAT IS WAXY COVERINGS ON THEIR SPOROPHYTE GENERATION. WE SHOW
###1792 A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT FEATURES FOR SURVIVAL ON LAND. AND ONE OF
###1799 THE MOST INTERESTING FOSSIL FINDINGS ABOUT ANCIENT VASCULAR
###1803 PLANTS WHICH ARE A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP IS THAT THE EARLIEST
###1809 VASCULAR PLANTS APPEAR VERY DIFFERENT FROM OUR MODERN VASCULAR
###1813 PLANTS. AND THESE ARISE ABOUT 50 MILLION YEARS AFTER THE
###1817 BRYOPHYTES FIRST APPEAR. AND THESE THINGS ARE ONLY ABOUT THE
###1822 SIZE OF A MATCHSTICK. THESE ARE REALLY SMALL. AND THEY DON'T
###1827 HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF CONDUCTING TISSUE. THEY ALSO DON'T HAVE
###1830 ANY LEAVES. THIS IS, THIS ARTIST'S RENDITION IS ACTUALLY
###1833 INACCURATE. YOU CAN, THIS IS, THESE SHOULD'T BE, THIS SHOULDN'T
###1836 SHOW LEAVES HERE. THESE ACTUALLY AREN'T THERE IN THE FOSSILS.
###1839 THERE ARE NO LEAVES. THERE ARE NO ROOTS. AND THEY HAVE
###1843 DICHOTOMOUS BRANCHING WHICH MEANS THERE'S NO APICAL DOMINANCE OF
###1847 ANY PARTICULAR BRANCH. THE APEX OF THE SHOOT JUST SPLITS INTO
###1851 TWO EQUAL BRANCHES AND YOU GET THIS Y-SHAPED BRANCHING THROUGHOUT
###1856 THE PLANT. AND THE TIPS OF THE BRANCHES ARE TERMINATED BY THESE
###1861 REPRODUCTIVE BODIES, EITHER BY A SPORANGIUM IN THE CASE OF A
###1865 SPOROPHYTE OR A GAMETANGIUM IN THE CASE OF A GAMETOPHYTE. AND
###1870 
###1870 THE GAMETOPHYTE GENERATION AND THE SPOROPHYTE GENERATION, THE
###1873 HAPLOID AND THE DIPLOID GENERATIONS ARE VERY, VERY SIMILAR
###1878 MORPHOLOGICALLY. SO WE'VE GONE FROM A SPORE OR GAMETOPHYTE
###1883 DOMINANT GENERATION, I SHOULD SAY GAMETOPHYTE DOMINANT LIFE CYCLE
###1888 AND THE BRYOPHYTES, TO A LIFE CYCLE WHERE THE GAMETOPHYTE AND THE
###1893 SPOROPHYTE SHARE DOMINANCE WHERE THEY ESSENTIALLY ARE ON EQUAL
###1895 FOOTING AS FAR AS THE DEGREE OF ELABORATION OF THESE TWO
###1898 GENERATIONS. THOUGH THAT'S A, A VERY SIMPLE VASCULAR PLANT
###1905 ORGANIZATION. AND THERE ARE NO MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP LEFT
###1909 TODAY. THEY'RE EXTINCT. RHYNIOPHYTE IS THE NAME, NAMED AFTER
###1913 THE RHYNIE CHERT WHERE THEY WERE FOUND IN THE U.K. BUT THESE
###1917 AREN'T AROUND ANYMORE, SO WE WON'T BE SEEING THESE. THE MODERN
###1923 VASCULAR PLANTS INCLUDE THOSE, THE FOUR GROUPS THAT I MENTIONED
###1928 EARLIER HERE. HERE YOU CAN SEE VASCULAR PLANTS, THE LYCOPHYTES,
###1934 WHICH OFTEN HAVE BEEN CALLED THE FERN ALLIES. THE TRUE FERNS
###1937 AND RELATIVES AND THEN THE SEED PLANTS OF WHICH THERE ARE
###1940 GYMNOSPERMS AND ANGIOSPERMS. WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THESE A
###1944 LOT. SO FIRST IT'S EASIEST TO INTRODUCE YOU TO TWO OF THESE
###1949 LINEAGES WHICH WE CALL THE FREE-SPORING VASCULAR PLANTS. AND
###1954 THESE REALLY SHOULD BE IN QUOTES BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A
###1956 MONOPHYLETIC GROUP. BUT IT INCLUDES TWO MONOPHYLETIC GROUPS,
###1962 THE FERNS AND RELATIVES, AND THE LYCOPHYTES. LYCOPHYTES HAVE
###1968 OFTEN BEEN THOUGHT TO BE VERY, VERY CLOSELY RELATED TO THE FERNS.
###1970 THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED FERN ALLIES COMMONLY. BUT, IN FACT,
###1974 THE FERNS AND RELATIVES ARE MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE SEED
###1978 
###1978 PLANTS THAN THEY ARE TO THE LYCOPHYTES. AND THIS HAS BEEN
###1982 REINFORCED BY MANY LINES OF EVIDENCE. THIS IS A BULLETPROOF
###1985 FINDING AT THIS POINT. THE LYCOPHYTES ARE SISTER TO ALL THE
###1990 OTHER VASCULAR PLANTS. AND THE LYCOPHYTES, THESE SO-CALLED FERN
###1997 ALLIES PLUS THE FERNS, THEY BOTH FREELY DISPERSE THEIR SPORES
###2002 INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. SO THEY DON'T HAVE SEEDS. THESE ARE THE
###2006 SEEDLESS VASCULAR PLANTS AS OPPOSED TO THIS VASCULAR PLANTS THAT
###2010 HAVE SEEDS, THE SEED PLANTS HERE. WELL THE ABSENCE OF SEEDS IS
###2014 A PRIMITIVE OR ANCESTRAL FEATURE, SO IT SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE
###2018 THAT THESE AREN'T A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP TAKEN TOGETHER. BUT
###2021 THESE ARE TWO WELL-SUPPORTED CLADES, THESE TWO GROUPS. AND HERE
###2026 THERE ARE, THE SEEDLESS VASCULAR PLANTS. LYCOPHYTES ON THE
###2031 RIGHT. AND FERNS, HORSETAILS AND WHISK FERNS, WHICH ARE ALL
###2036 BASICALLY THE FERN GROUP, ON THE LEFT. NOW THE LYCOPHYTES WHICH
###2041 ARE SISTER TO ALL THE OTHER VASCULAR PLANTS ARE INTERESTING
###2046 BECAUSE THERE ARE BASICALLY THREE MAJOR GROUPS THAT ARE STILL
###2049 ALIVE. TWO OF THEM ARE SHOWN HERE. AND YOU MIGHT AT THESE AND
###2052 SAY, WAIT A MINUTE, HE MIXED UP THE SLIDES. THOSE ARE MOSSES.
###2055 WELL, THEY LOOK LIKE MOSSES. BUT THESE ARE SPOROPHYTES, NOT
###2059 GAMETOPHYTES. SO THE DOMINANT GENERATION IN ALL THE MODERN
###2063 VASCULAR PLANTS, INCLUDING THE LYCOPHYTES IS THE SPOROPHYTE
###2066 GENERATION. THE GAMETOPHYTE GENERATION IS HIGHLY REDUCED. SO
###2072 WE'VE GONE FROM ONLY HAVING A GAMETOPHYTE GENERATION, IN THE CASE
###2076 OF THE FRESHWATER GREEN ALGAE THAT ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO LAND
###2079 PLANTS, TO HAVING A GAMETOPHYTE DOMINANT ALTERNATION OF
###2084 
###2084 GENERATIONS WITH A PARASITIC SPOROPHYTE IN THE BRYOPHYTES.
###2087 THOUGH THE SHARING OF DOMINANCE IN THE FIRST VASCULAR PLANTS THAT
###2092 ARE NOW EXTINCT, SHARING OF DOMINANCE BETWEEN THE GAMETOPHYTE AND
###2095 THE SPOROPHYTE. AND IN ALL THE MODERN VASCULAR PLANTS THE
###2099 SPOROPHYTE IS DOMINATE. IT'S THE MAJOR PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISM,
###2103 THE BIG BRANCHING ORGANISM. AND THE GAMETOPHYTE IS HIGHLY
###2106 REDUCED. THOUGH IN LYCOPHYTES HERE WE SEE, ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN
###2112 TELL THESE AREN'T MOSSES, IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY YOU SEE THAT THERE
###2116 ARE ACTUALLY, WELL, IT'S HARD TO MAKE OUT, BUT THERE ARE CONES ON
###2122 THESE, ACTUAL STROBILI. SO IN A LOT OF THE VASCULAR PLANTS WE
###2127 HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED CONES OR A STROBILUS OR STROBILI, PLURAL,
###2131 WHICH ARE BASICALLY JUST A STRUCTURE MADE UP OF MODIFIED LEAVES
###2138 THAT ARE IN ASSOCIATION WITH SPORANGIA. SO IT'S A STRUCTURE
###2142 THAT BEARS SPORANGIA. AND THESE INCLUDE, IN THIS PARTICULAR
###2148 GROUP WHAT ARE CALLED THE SPIKE MOSSES. THESE ARE THE CLUB
###2152 MOSES. THESE ARE NOT MOSSES THOUGH. THEY'RE, THEY ARE VASCULAR
###2156 PLANTS. IN THIS GROUP WE HAVE DESICCATION TOLERANCE IN SOME OF
###2159 THEM. THEY CAN DRY OUT COMPLETELY AND REVIVE. SO SOME OF THESE
###2162 EARLY BRANCHING LINEAGES OF VASCULAR PLANTS DO HAVE THIS ABILITY
###2169 TO DESICCATE AND REVIVE. BUT IT'S VERY LIMITED WITHIN THE
###2175 VASCULAR PLANTS IN GENERAL. OKAY, SO THE LYCOPHYTES ARE
###2179 WIDESPREAD. THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 1200 SPECIES WORLDWIDE. IT'S
###2183 NOT A VERY DIVERSE GROUP. BUT IT USED TO BE REALLY DIVERSE,
###2186 AND I'LL SHOW YOU SOME ANCIENT LYCOPHYTES IN A MOMENT. BACK IN
###2190 THE CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD, IN THE PALEOZOIC THEY WERE REALLY BIG
###2195 
###2195 TREES. NOW THEY'RE JUST SMALL PLANTS THAT, YOU KNOW, DON'T
###2200 TYPICALLY GET MORE THAN ABOUT YEA BIG. SO THAT'S A, IT'S NOT A
###2204 PARTICULARLY CONSPICUOUS GROUP OF PLANTS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE
###2208 FOUND FROM TROPICAL TO TEMPERATE ENVIRONMENTS. OKAY, THE FERNS
###2213 AND RELATIVES ARE MUCH MORE DIVERSE. THERE ARE ABOUT 12,000
###2217 SPECIES OF THESE. ABOUT TEN TIMES MORE THAN THERE ARE OF THE
###2220 LYCOPHYTES. AND PROBABLY A LOT OF UNDESCRIBED DIVERSITY TOO.
###2225 NOW WE SINGLE OUT THE HORSETAILS HERE AND THE WHISK FERNS HERE
###2231 BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY FAIRLY RECENTLY, WITHIN THE LAST TEN, 15
###2234 YEARS THAT IT WAS REALIZED THAT THESE ARE NOT, THAT THESE ARE
###2238 ACTUALLY FERNS. THESE DON'T LOOK TOO FERN-LIKE. THEIR STEMS,
###2244 THEY HAVE AERIAL STEMS THAT ARE PHOTOSYNTHETIC AND IMPREGNATED
###2249 WITH SILICA, THE HORSETAILS. THESE WHORLED BRANCHES, WITH MINI
###2254 BRANCHES THAT ARE NODE, IT'S A VERY BIZARRE LOOKING PLANT.
###2257 THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT A DOZEN SPECIES WORLDWIDE. BUT THEY'RE WIDE
###2260 SPREAD IN NORTHERN TEMPERATE AREAS. IN ANY CASE, THIS IS A GROUP
###2265 THAT WAS THOUGHT TO REPRESENT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LINEAGE, BUT
###2267 IN FACT TURNS OUT TO BE A FERN GROUP. AND THIS THING MAY LOOK
###2271 FAMILIAR AS SIMILAR TO THAT EARLIEST VASCULAR PLANT THAT I SHOWED
###2276 YOU WITH THAT Y-SHAPED BRANCHING AND AND NO LEAVES. AND IT
###2280 DOESN'T HAVE ROOTS EITHER. IT'S ONE OF THE FEW VASCULAR PLANTS
###2283 THAT DOESN'T HAVE ROOTS. AND IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE ONE OF THE
###2287 LAST SURVIVING REMNANTS OF THAT EARLIEST GROUP OF VASCULAR PLANTS
###2290 UNTIL MOLECULAR DATA CAME ALONG AND SHOWED THAT IT'S JUST A
###2294 HIGHLY MODIFIED FERN. SO THE GUY THAT ACTUALLY USED TO PUSH THE
###2299 
###2299 IDEA THAT THIS WAS THE LAST OF THE RHYNIOPHYTES WHEN HE, HE WAS
###2304 ACTUALLY PRESENT WHEN THE MOLECULAR DATA WERE PRESENTED SHOWING
###2307 THAT THE WHISK FERNS ARE FERNS AND NOT ANCIENT RHYNIOPHYTES.
###2311 AND HE STOOD UP AND SAID, YOU KNOW HE WAS AN OLD MAN AT POINT
###2313 POINT, HE STOOD UP AND SAID, YOU JUST RUINED MY LIFE, YOU KNOW,
###2316 TO THE GUY THAT MADE THAT FINDING. SO IT WAS A PRETTY DRAMATIC
###2320 MOMENT AND, FOR THE SPEAKER WHO WAS JUST A YOUNG GRADUATE
###2325 STUDENT. AND THE GUY THAT SAID THAT, YOU KNOW THAT HE WRECKED
###2331 HIS LIFE, WAS ONE OF THE, WAS CONSIDERED THE WORLD AUTHORITY ON
###2335 SEEDLESS VASCULAR PLANTS. OKAY, SO THE LIFE CYCLE OF FERNS --
###2342 YEAH, SO BASICALLY YOU CAN'T GET TOO ATTACHED TO YOUR IDEAS IN
###2345 SCIENCE. THEY'RE ALWAYS SUBJECT TO BEING OVERTURNED WITH
###2349 ADDITIONAL DATA. SO LIFE CYCLE OF FERNS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE
###2356 SAW IN THE MOSSES. BUT AS I MENTIONED THE HAPLOID GENERATION IS
###2360 RELATIVELY REDUCED, AND THE SPOROPHYTE GENERATION IS DOMINANT IN
###2365 TERMS OF BEING THE, THE CONSPICUOUS AND TYPICALLY MUCH MORE
###2370 LONG-LIVED ORGANISM. HERE YOU CAN SEE THE SPOROPHYTE GENERATION
###2375 IN THE LOWER HALF. THE HAPLOID GENERATION IN THE UPPER HALF.
###2379 SO AGAIN, MEIOSIS RESULTING IN SPORES, HAPLOID SPORES. AND HERE
###2384 YOU CAN SEE A TYPICAL FERN GAMETOPHYTE. AND THIS IS USUALLY AN
###2389 EXTREMELY TINY ORGANISM THAT YOU WOULD EASILY OVERLOOK UNLESS
###2394 YOU'RE DOWN ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES DIGGING AROUND IN THE SOIL.
###2399 AND OFTENTIMES THE FERN GAMETOPHYTE IS HEART-SHAPED LIKE THIS.
###2403 THAT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE. AND THEY'RE OFTEN PHOTOSYNTHETIC. SOME
###2409 OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY FOUND UNDERGROUND AND THEY DON'T
###2411 
###2411 PHOTOSYNTHESIZE AT ALL. THEY'RE IN ASSOCIATION WITH MYCORRHIZAL
###2414 FUNGI THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER AND GAIN THEIR NUTRITION THAT WAY.
###2420 BUT THEY'RE TINY ORGANISMS. BUT THEY DO PRODUCE GAMETANGIA.
###2425 AND THEY'RE COMMONLY IN THE CASE OF FERNS, THEY'RE COMMONLY
###2428 BISEXUAL OR HERMAPHRODITIC, PRODUCING BOTH ANTHERIDIA, THE MALE
###2434 GAMETANGIUM OR ARCHEGONIA, THE FEMALE GAMETANGIA. SO WE HAVE
###2439 SPERM WHICH, AND AGAIN IN THE FERNS, EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A REALLY
###2443 WIDELY, WIDESPREAD AND DIVERSE GROUP OF PLANTS, THEY HAVE
###2448 FREE-SWIMMING SPERM. THE SPERM HAVE TO SWIM THROUGH THE OPEN
###2452 ENVIRONMENT TO THE NECK OF THE ARCHEGONIUM AND SWIM DOWN THE NECK
###2457 CANAL TO THE, THE CANAL DOWN TO THE EGG AND FERTILIZE THE EGG.
###2463 NOW THERE ARE FERNS THAT YOU FIND IN DESERT ENVIRONMENTS. AND
###2466 SOME OF THESE ARE DESICCATION TOLERANT. THEIR LEAVES CAN TRY
###2470 UP. IN FACT, THAT'S COMMON IN FERNS THAT OCCUR IN DESERT-LIKE
###2474 ENVIRONMENTS. BUT IN GENERAL THOSE DESERT FERNS ARE STRICTLY
###2480 ASEXUAL IN THEIR REPRODUCTION. THIS IS A REALLY LIMITING BIOLOGY
###2486 FOR BEING ABLE TO HAVE SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN DRY ENVIRONMENTS.
###2492 OKAY, SO THEN WE HAVE FERTILIZATION DOWN INSIDE THE ARCHEGONIUM
###2495 AGAIN LIKE IN THE MOSSES. WE GET A DEVELOPMENT OF AN EMBRYO
###2499 AGAIN. AND HERE'S THE YOUNG SPOROPHYTE, GERMINATING OUT OF THE
###2503 ARCHEGONIUM. AND IT'S ACTUALLY PARASITIC ON THE GAMETOPHYTE
###2508 INITIALLY. BUT THAT DOESN'T LAST LONG. IT DEVELOPS ITS OWN
###2511 ROOT SYSTEM. THE GAMETOPHYTE DOESN'T HAVE A ROOT ASSIGNMENT.
###2515 IT JUST HAS RHIZOIDS, THESE FILAMENTS OF CELLS THAT ASSOCIATE
###2520 WITH THE UPPER SUBSTRATE BUT ARE NOT REALLY PARTICULARLY
###2523 
###2523 IMPORTANT IN CONDUCTION. BUT THE SPOROPHYTE DOES HAVE A GOOD
###2527 ROOT SYSTEM AS YOU CAN SEE HERE. AND THE SPOROPHYTE OF FERNS
###2533 TYPICALLY HAS ITS STEM UNDERGROUND AS A HORIZONTAL STEM OR A
###2538 RHIZOME. A RHIZOME IS JUST A HORIZONTAL UNDERGROUND STEM. AND
###2544 STEMS PRODUCE LEAVES AS WELL AS IN THIS CASE ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS
###2549 OR ROOTS THAT FORM WHERE THEY NORMALLY WOULDN'T FROM THE SIDE OF
###2552 THE STEM. AND THE LEAVES EMERGE FROM THE GROUND. AND THE MAIN
###2558 FERN BODY THAT WE SEE ABOVE GROUND ARE THE LEAVES TYPICALLY.
###2562 THERE ARE SOME TREE FERNS THAT PRODUCE LONG STEMS, AERIAL STEMS
###2569 THAT CAN GET UP TO SEVERAL METERS IN HEIGHT, BUT THEY'RE A
###2571 MINORITY OF THE FERNS. AND ALSO THERE ARE THOSE HORSETAILS I
###2574 MENTIONED WHICH HAVE AERIAL STEMS THAT ARE PRETTY BIZARRE THINGS
###2578 THAT WERE ONLY RECENTLY RECOGNIZED AS FERNS. NOW THE SPORANGIA
###2584 OF FERNS ARE TYPICALLY, BUT NOT ALWAYS, BUT TYPICALLY ON THE
###2588 UNDERSIDE OF THE LEAF. OR SHELTERED ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE
###2591 LEAF IN THESE LITTLE CLUSTERS CALLED SORI. SINGULAR WOULD BE A
###2596 SORUS. HERE'S JUST ONE OF SPORANGIA ASSOCIATED WITH EACH ONE OF
###2600 THE SORI. AND IN FERNS THERE'S OFTEN A MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS FOR
###2607 FORCEFUL EJECTION OF THE, OF THE SPORES. AND MOST FERNS HAVE
###2612 THIS CATAPULT-LIKE EJECTION SYSTEM WHERE THE SPORANGIUM BURSTS
###2616 OPEN IN A PARTICULAR WAY AS IT DRIES OUT AND IT FORCEFULLY
###2619 CATAPULTS THESE SPORES. SO THE SPORES ARE EJECTED AWAY FROM
###2625 THE, THE PARENT PLANT. SO THAT'S A NICE DISPERSAL MECHANISM.
###2631 AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THE UNDERSIDE OF A FERN LEAF. THIS IS A
###2635 SWORD FERN WHICH YOU FIND OUT IN REDWOOD FORESTS, UNDERSTORIES
###2639 
###2639 TYPICALLY. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE INDIVIDUAL SORI, THESE CIRCULAR
###2645 LITTLE BROWN STRUCTURES. HERE'S ONE OF THOSE ENLARGED. AND YOU
###2649 CAN SEE EACH ONE OF THEM IS ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF
###2653 SPORANGIA, SO THIS, FOR EXAMPLE, IS A SPORANGIUM, NOT A SPORE.
###2659 EACH ONE OF THESE CONTAINS DOZENS OF SPORES. SO THERE ARE A
###2664 LARGE NUMBER OF SPORES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH ONE OF THESE
###2667 SPORANGIA. IT'S PROTECTED SOMETIMES BY A SHIELD-LIKE STRUCTURE
###2670 HERE WHICH IS AN INDUSIUM. NOT ALL FERNS HAVE THIS. BUT IT
###2674 SERVES TO PROTECT THE DEVELOPING SPORANGIA. AND IT WITHERS AWAY
###2679 WHEN THE SPORES ARE READY TO DISPERSE. IT GETS OUT OF THE WAY
###2682 OF THE DISPERSAL MECHANISM. SO THE SHAPE AND SIZE AND LOCATION
###2687 OF THESE SO-CALLED SORI IS DIAGNOSTIC FOR DIFFERENT TAXA OF
###2693 FERNS. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IF YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY FERNS,
###2698 YOU USUALLY ARE HAVING TO LOOK FOR THEIR SPORANGIA AND HOW
###2700 THEY'RE ARRANGED ON THE LEAVES. OKAY, SO, WE'RE AT THE POINT
###2707 NOW WHERE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO INTRODUCE THIS CONCEPT OF
###2712 HETEROSPORY WHICH JUST MEANS BASICALLY OTHER SPORES, WHERE
###2716 THERE'S MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF SPORE AS OPPOSED TO HOMOSPORY WHERE
###2720 THERE'S ONLY ONE TYPE OF SPORE. AND THE FERN THAT WE JUST LOOKED
###2726 AT, THAT LIFE CYCLE IS HOMOSPOROUS. REMEMBER THERE WAS JUST ONE
###2730 TYPE OF SPORE THAT GAVE RISE TO ONE TYPE OF GAMETOPHYTE THAT BORE
###2734 BOTH TYPES OF GAMETANGIA, BOTH, IT PRODUCED BOTH SPERM AND EGGS
###2739 ON THE SAME INDIVIDUAL. I SHOULD MENTION THAT FERNS HAVE
###2742 DIFFERENTIAL TIMING OF SPERM PRODUCTION AND EGG PRODUCTION ON THE
###2748 SAME GAMETOPHYTE THAT TENDS TO LIMIT SELFING. OTHERWISE THERE'D
###2754 
###2754 BE POTENTIALLY A LOT OF INBREEDING. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF
###2759 PLANTS THAT HAVE UNISEXUAL GAMETOPHYTES. AND I SHOWED YOU A
###2762 CASE OF A MOSS THAT DID THAT. IN THE CASE OF MOSSES WE DON'T
###2766 HAVE REALLY DISTINCTIVE SPORE SIZE DIFFERENCES LIKE WE SEE IN THE
###2770 VASCULAR PLANTS. FOR EXAMPLE, SELAGINELLA SHOWN HERE WHERE WE
###2774 HAVE HETEROSPORY, LEADING TO UNISEXUAL GAMETOPHYTES. THOUGH
###2780 SOME OF THE LYCOPHYTES AND A MINORITY OF THE FERNS, NAMELY THE
###2783 WATER FERNS, PRODUCE TWO TYPES OF SPORES. THIS IS ACTUALLY A
###2788 LYCOPHYTE CONE THAT'S BEEN SLICED DOWN THE MIDDLE LONGITUDINALLY,
###2794 RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE SPORANGIA HERE. ON ONE SIDE
###2798 IT'S PRODUCING MICROSPORANGIA WITH ONE TYPE OF SPORE, THE
###2801 MICROSPORES. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE IT'S PRODUCING MEGASPORANGIA
###2806 WITH MEGASPORES WHICH ARE LARGER OBVIOUSLY. YOU CAN SEE THERE'S
###2809 ONLY FOUR PRODUCTS OF MEIOSIS IN ONE OF THESE. THE FOUR PRODUCTS
###2813 OF MEIOSIS ARE THE ONLY SPORES IN ONE OF THESE SPORANGIA WHEREAS
###2818 THERE ARE LARGE NUMBERS OF MICROSPORES HERE. THOUGH THE
###2821 MICROSPORES GERMINATE TO BECOME MALE GAMETOPHYTES THAT PRODUCE
###2828 SPERM, THE MEGASPORES GERMINATE TO BECOME MEGAGAMETOPHYTES,
###2832 FEMALE GAMETOPHYTES THAT PRODUCE EGGS. AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE
###2839 INDICATED HERE. THE HOMOSPORY, THE PRESENCE OF ONE TYPE OF
###2844 SPORE, IS ANCESTRAL IN BOTH THE LYCOPHYTES AND THE FERNS. AND
###2847 HETEROSPORY IS DERIVED IN BOTH GROUPS INDEPENDENTLY. AND IN
###2851 BOTH CASES WHAT WE SEE IS THAT THE GAMETOPHYTES THAT DEVELOP FROM
###2855 THESE DIFFERENT SPORES HAVE ALL OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT OCCURRING
###2860 INSIDE THE SPORE WALL. SO THEY'RE PROTECTED INSIDE THE SPORE
###2865 
###2865 WALL. AND IT'S ONLY LATE IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY EMERGE
###2869 FROM THE SPORE WALL. SO THERE'S SOME ADDITIONAL PROTECTION
###2872 AFFORDED THESE HETEROSPOROUS GAMETOPHYTES IN BOTH THE FERNS AND
###2878 THE, THE LYCOPHYTES. THOUGH HETEROSPORY MAY HAVE ARISEN IN PART
###2886 AS A MEANS OF PROMOTING OUTCROSSING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SELF WITH
###2890 YOURSELF OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE ONLY PRODUCING ONE TYPE OF GAMETE.
###2894 BUT IT ALSO MAY HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT FOR PROTECTION OF THE
###2897 GAMETOPHYE GENERATION, THAT VULNERABLE GAMETOPHYTE GENERATION MAY
###2901 BE MORE READILY PROTECTED IN THESE PARTICULAR TYPE, IN THESE
###2907 HETEROSPOROUS LIFE CYCLE. AND WE'LL SEE THIS TAKEN TO A REAL
###2909 EXTREME IN THE SEED PLANTS. AND THAT'S WHY I'M BOTHERING TO
###2912 MENTION IT. IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE AN ESOTERIC ASIDE RIGHT NOW, BUT
###2918 THE SEED PLANTS, ALL OF THEM ARE HETEROSPOROUS, AND THE EVOLUTION
###2922 OF THE SEED WAS, WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF HETEROSPORY. THOUGH
###2928 GETTING BACK TO THE LYCOPHYTES AND FERNS, EVEN THOUGH TODAY
###2932 THEY'RE FAIRLY LOW STATURE PLANTS FOR THE MOST PART, IF WE GO
###2936 BACK TO THE TIME WHEN THE SEED PLANTS WERE JUST BEGINNING TO
###2939 EVOLVE, BACK IN THE LATE PALEOZOIC, ABOUT 300 TO 350 MILLION
###2944 YEARS AGO, THE LYCOPHYTES WERE ABSOLUTELY IMMENSE. HERE'S A
###2948 6-FOOT TALL PERSON FOR COMPARISON. HERE'S A TREE LYCOPHYTE.
###2954 AND HERE'S A HORSETAIL, BASICALLY A TREE HORSETAIL. AND THESE
###2958 THINGS DOMINATED THE SO-CALLED COAL FORESTS OF THE CARBONIFEROUS,
###2962 WHICH ARE THE BASIS FOR OUR EXTENSIVE COAL DEPOSITS WORLDWIDE.
###2968 AND THIS WAS A TIME WHEN THERE WAS VERY LOW TOPOGRAPHY ON EARTH
###2971 FOR THE MOST PART. AND TEMPERATURES AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS
###2975 
###2975 PERIOD WERE VERY WARM AND WET. AND THERE WERE BOGGY
###2979 ENVIRONMENTS WHERE FOSSILIZATION WOULD HAVE BEEN PROMOTED. ALSO
###2982 THESE TREE LYCOPHYTES AND TREE FERNS HAD A LOT OF LIGNIN IN THEIR
###2987 TISSUES WHICH IS ALSO FOUND IN WOOD. BUT PRIMARILY IN THEIR
###2992 BARK, THEY DIDN'T HAVE VERY MUCH WOOD. AND THIS ALLOWED THEM TO
###2995 FOSSILIZE EASILY BECAUSE LIGNIN'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DECOMPOSE AND
###3000 THERE MAY NOT HAVE EVEN BEEN THE APPROPRIATE DECOMPOSERS AT THIS
###3003 TIME. OKAY, SO WE'LL GET INTO SEED PLANTS NEXT TIME. AND
###3010 YOU'LL START TO SEE THESE IN LAB THIS WEEK.
###3014
