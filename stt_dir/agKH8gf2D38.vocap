###6 THE PRESIDENT: Thanks for coming by to say hello. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your kind
###9 introduction, and thanks for the invitation to tour this impressive facility. The restart
###16 of Browns Ferry Unit Number 1 represents the first nuclear reactor to come online in the
###23 United States in more than a decade. (Applause.) This is a demonstration that one is capable
###39 of doing a job on time and on budget. And I congratulate you all for your hard work,
###47 and thank you for the contribution you're making to the United States of America.
###51 I'm going to talk a little bit about nuclear power today, and there's no better place to
###59 do it here than with a group of folks who understand the great benefits of nuclear power
###65 to our country. I believe that it is essential that we have a comprehensive energy policy
###72 to be able to deal with the challenges we're going to face in the 21st century, whether
###78 that be energy independence or economic security or good environmental policy. And at the core
###84 of such policy must be electricity generated from nuclear power. (Applause.)
###95 I'm also here to nudge Congress along. They're working on a bill -- (laughter) -- that I
###103 hope that they can get to my desk, that is a good bill, a balanced bill, a reasonable
###107 approach to making sure we continue to be wise about how we use energy in the United
###114 States.
###114 I do want to thank Bill for his leadership, and I thank the members of the board of the
###119 TVA. I thank Tom Kilgore for taking time to visit today. He's led me on a tour with R.G.
###126 Jones. Some of you may have heard of R.G. (Applause.) R.G. and I discovered we're both
###138 60. (Laughter.) We were born in 1946, which is a fine year to be born, at least as far
###145 as R.G. and I are concerned. (Laughter.) I reminded him 60 is not as old as it used to
###152 sound -- until I climbed up all those stairs to get to the control room. (Laughter.) I
###157 also want to thank Brian O'Grady, the Vice President here. (Applause.)
###166 Put a good man who understands nuclear power as the head of the Energy Department, Sam
###173 Bodman. He's with us today. Mr. Secretary, thank you for traveling with us. Appreciate
###178 you coming. (Applause.) Also with us is Dr. Dale Klein, Chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
###186 Commission. It's an important position. It's a position that's going to expedite the regulations
###193 so we can get more plants up and running. And I'll talk a little bit about his intentions
###198 and our intentions to help increase nuclear power here in the United States.
###203 I'm traveling with a fine United States Senator, in Jeff Sessions. (Applause.) As well as the
###214 Congressman from this district, a man awfully proud of the work you do here, and that's
###217 Bud Cramer. (Applause.) Finally, we let a fellow from Mobile tag along with us, Congressman
###227 Jo Bonner. Appreciate you coming, Congressman. (Applause.)
###228 I thank all the employees who work at this plant. Thanks for what you're doing. Thanks
###237 for being skillful. Thanks for working hard. Thanks for helping the country.
###242 The world is seeing the promise and potential of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. I emphasize
###248 that word, peaceful use, because one of my predecessors, Dwight David Eisenhower, in
###254 1953 called on the world's scientists and engineers to find a way to produce peaceful
###259 power from atomic energy that would serve the needs, rather than the fears, of mankind.
###267 That's exactly what we're doing here. You're serving the needs, rather than the fears,
###272 of mankind. You're helping implement the vision of President Dwight David Eisenhower.
###280 Nuclear power is America's third leading source of electricity. It provides nearly 20 percent
###285 of our country's electricity. I don't know if a lot of our citizens understand that,
###290 but nuclear power is a key component of economic vitality, because it provides 20 percent of
###297 the electricity.
###298 Interestingly enough, nuclear power provides 78 percent of electricity for France, provides
###303 50 percent for Sweden, 30 percent for the entire European Union. China has nine nuclear
###312 reactors in operation and has ambitious plans to build many more over the next two decades.
###319 Nuclear power is prevalent and it's recognized as a necessary power source, not only here
###326 in the United States, but around the world. Nuclear power is clean. It's clean, domestic
###336 energy. There is a lot of discussion about the environment, as there should be. We certainly
###340 want to leave the environment better for the next generation that comes along. There's
###343 a lot of discussion about greenhouse gases, which I believe is a serious problem.
###350 And therefore, I remind those who share my concern about greenhouse gases that nuclear
###356 energy produces no greenhouse gases. If you are interested in cleaning up the air, then
###362 you ought to be an advocate for nuclear power. (Applause.) Without nuclear power here in
###374 the United States, there would be nearly 700 million additional tons of carbon dioxide
###378 in the atmosphere every year. There is no single solution to climate change, but there
###385 can be no solution without nuclear power.
###390 Nuclear power is safe. The nuclear sector is one of the safest industries in the United
###396 States. Advances in science and engineering and plant design have made nuclear plants
###403 even safer than the last generation of plants. In other words, technology has advanced, knowledge
###409 has advanced, engineering has advanced. This is a safe plant and the people in the United
###413 States must understand that.
###415 They've also got to understand that NRC inspectors are stationed full time at these plants to
###421 provide daily inspections, and I appreciate the NRC inspectors who are with us today.
###425 In other words, we go extra steps to be able to say to the American people, this is a safe
###431 place to work and it's a safe facility to have in the area of the country in which you
###437 live.
###439 Nuclear power is affordable and it is reliable. Once a nuclear plant is constructed, fuel
###447 and operating costs are low. The cost of electricity from a nuclear power plant is stable. It is
###454 predictable. The cost of electricity from a plant like this doesn't fluctuate the way
###464 plants fired by natural gas can fluctuate. The flow of power is not intermittent like
###470 the wind. This is a reliable source of low-cost energy.
###477 We need nuclear power to play a greater role in our future. That's what I want to share
###482 with you and the American people, as we talk about a comprehensive energy strategy, a comprehensive
###489 energy plan, nuclear power has got to be a really important part of our future.
###496 Nuclear power is the only large-scale emissions-free power source that is currently able to meet
###499 the growing need for electricity. As our economy grows, with additional demands for power and
###507 electricity, nuclear power can handle those needs.
###510 In order to keep pace with our nuclear energy needs, experts believe it will be necessary
###514 to build an average of three new plants per year starting in 2015. In other words, it's
###519 one thing to talk about nuclear power; it's another thing to have -- understand the strategy
###523 necessary.
###525 So we are going to need three plants starting in 2015. And as we tackle climate change,
###529 it may be necessary to have even more plants. Here's the problem: Our country has not ordered
###536 a new nuclear power plant since the 1970s, partially as a result of constant litigation
###545 and overly complex regulations. So we're working to overcome those obstacles. I appreciate
###552 the fact that the TVA is making decisions to move forward nuclear power. It's time for
###559 our country to start building nuclear power plants again. That's what I want to share
###564 with you. (Applause.)
###568 One thing to restart one, and I congratulate you. It's another thing to build the new ones.
###578 And that's what we ought to have happen if we're interested in a comprehensive, sound,
###583 wise energy policy that is environmentally friendly. The federal government is helping
###589 to expand the safe use of nuclear power in some important ways. First, we've set up what's
###595 called the Nuclear Power 2010 initiative. We launched the nuclear power initiative,
###601 which is a partnership between industry and the U.S. government, to reduce regulatory
###606 and other barriers to the development of new nuclear power plants. That's why we set it
###611 up. We want to start building plants, and we recognize that there have been some regulatory
###617 burdens that prevent the construction of new plants or at least discourage the construction
###623 of new plants.
###624 The 2008 budget I submitted would double the requested funding for this initiative to $114
###630 million. In other words, it takes money to get this initiative moving. And we're asking
###635 Congress to spend money on it in order to help us put in a comprehensive energy strategy.
###639 It makes sense. It's just a common sense strategy. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is working
###647 to improve and streamline the regulatory process to help accelerate the construction of nuclear
###652 plants. Under the old system, the permitting process was slow. Some of the older hands
###658 here might remember that. It was cumbersome, because it limited builders to completing
###665 only one step at a time before moving on. You could only do one thing, and then there
###669 would be regulatory deals, and another thing -- and it just took a long time. And when
###673 something takes a long time to build, that discourages capital and discourages people
###680 from moving forward. Plus you could get sued all the time. That would discourage people,
###687 as well.
###688 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is implementing a more efficient review process that allows
###692 builders to complete several steps at a time without compromising safety. They took a good
###697 look at the problems, they said we need more nuclear power, and so we're going to streamline
###702 the process. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission now expects 20 applications for combined construction
###709 and operating licenses for up to 30 new reactors. In other words, we're beginning to make some
###714 progress. Things are beginning to change. Attitudes are changing, and so is the regulatory
###719 process, which has enabled me to tell you we've got 20 applications for up to 30 new
###726 reactors. That is good news for the American consumer. (Applause.)
###731 We think that we ought to -- America ought to -- should be able to start construction
###739 on additional nuclear plants by the end of this decade. That's not all that far away.
###746 So I've got the Chairman of the NRC here. I want him to hear what I just said. (Laughter.)
###751 He's doing some good work. He's got more work to do.
###756 I signed an energy bill in 2005 that included important incentives to support the development
###764 of nuclear power, including federal risk insurance for builders of new nuclear plants, loan guarantee
###771 eligibility and production tax credits. In other words, to get this industry started,
###776 put some incentives out there for people that would be spending the money to get the plants
###780 going.
###781 We're working to settle the issue of storage for nuclear waste. That's an issue. More than
###789 55,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste are stored at a hundred sites
###794 in 39 states. I've submitted a budget of $495 million to continue progress on licensing
###802 Yucca Mountain as a repository for spent fuel.
###807 There's also another idea that I want you to -- I know you know about it, but I want
###813 Americans and Congress to consider. We ought to do something about reprocessing. We ought
###819 to bring that technology to bear. (Applause.) We ought to bring new technologies to bear
###829 to help us all deal with the spent fuel. So we proposed a global nuclear energy partnership
###837 to work with nations with advanced civilian nuclear energy programs, such as France, Japan,
###844 China, and Russia. And the reason why we proposed this partnership is we want to use technologies,
###850 new technologies -- develop and use technologies that effectively and safely recycle spent
###857 nuclear fuel.
###860 Reprocessing spent uranium fuel for use in advanced reactors will allow us to extract
###865 more energy and has the potential to reduce storage requirements for nuclear waste by
###871 up to 90 percent. I am confident that we can have the technological breakthroughs necessary
###878 to deal with the fuel. Congress needs to spend the money in order to do the research. And
###885 when we do, we will be able to answer a lot of the charges of our critics that say, what
###890 are you going to do with the fuel?
###890 Well, here's a good answer: Recycle it, reburn it and reduce the amount of the problem. And
###899 that's what the United States needs to be doing. (Applause.)
###908 Nuclear power is part of a broader strategy. I want to spend a little time on the broader
###914 strategy before we all pass out in here. (Laughter.) There's enough hot air in the room as there
###931 is. (Laughter.)
###932 We're too dependent on oil. And you know, in 1985, about 27 percent of our oil came
###938 from other countries; today, about 60 percent does. And that's a dependency that creates
###944 economic and national security problems for us.
###948 On the national security side, our dependence on oil leaves us more vulnerable to hostile
###954 regimes and terrorists. If you can blow up oil facilities overseas, it will affect the
###959 price of oil here at home. When you're dependent on something and somebody disrupts the supply
###964 on which you're dependent, it will affect you. It effects international politics, to
###971 a certain extent, to be dependent on oil.
###973 When the price of oil goes up for whatever reason overseas, it affects the price of gasoline
###981 here in northern Alabama. So there is an economic issue for being dependent on oil. And, of
###988 course, when oil is burned as a fuel, it effects the environment. So we've got to change our
###996 dependency.
###997 One way to do so is to spend some of your money on new technologies that will change
###1003 how we live in positive ways. So we spent $12 billion since I've been the President
###1010 to develop cleaner, cheaper and more reliable energy sources. I think that's a wise use
###1014 of your money -- to encourage research and development on new ways to drive your cars,
###1022 for example.
###1024 One such example is -- that we're spending your money on is for clean coal technologies.
###1033 We've got to do something to make sure that when we have electricity generated by coal
###1038 that we can say to future generations of Americans that we're going to protect the environment,
###1042 as well. We've got a lot of coal. If you want to be less dependent on foreign sources of
###1047 oil, you ought to use the energy sources you've got here at home. Not all electricity is going
###1051 to be generated as a result of nuclear power. We're going to be burning coal. And so we
###1056 are spending a lot of money, and I believe that we'll have emission-free coal plants
###1062 that will capture and remove virtually all air pollutants and greenhouse gases from burning
###1066 coal. That's what the experts tell me.
###1068 So some of your money, some of your hard-earned money is going to encourage that kind of research.
###1073 I think it's worth it. And I know it's necessary if we want to be less dependent on oil and
###1079 be good about how we deal with the environment.
###1080 And we're also spending money to help others research wind and solar power. That's a nice
###1088 alternative. It's certainly not going to -- wind power is not going to be nearly as effective
###1092 and efficient as nuclear power, but it can be a part of the mix.
###1097 If you want to affect dependency on oil, then we've got to figure out how to use -- put
###1102 different power sources in our cars. Gasoline is oil. You know, so when you say I'm using
###1112 gasoline, you really are using oil. Because that's how -- that's where gasoline comes
###1117 from. And so one idea that we're working on is to encourage ethanol, which works. See,
###1126 if you're driving your automobile based upon something a farmer grows here in northern
###1131 Alabama, as opposed to something that's as a result of buying from overseas -- makes
###1137 sense to me.
###1138 You've got your farmer growing something that powers your automobile, I think it puts us
###1141 in a much better position economically, from a national security perspective. And we're
###1146 spending a fair amount of your money to make sure that we can use something other than
###1151 corn from which to make ethanol. If you're a hog farmer, you're getting tired of seeing
###1156 the corn prices go up. If you're a corn farmer, it's a nice feeling to see the prices go up.
###1163 (Laughter.)
###1164 But we believe we can come up with technologies that will enable us to use wood chips to make
###1170 ethanol that you can put in your automobiles to help us become less dependent on oil, or
###1175 switchgrasses. That would be nice for some of the people from my state. Switchgrass grows
###1179 in a nice dry environment. I understand you're dry here, by the way. The senator and the
###1184 congressmen are working hard on me about the drought that you've got here. (Laughter.)
###1189 But some parts of our country need to -- have got dry country and they can grow some switchgrass.
###1194 The whole idea is to come up with different ways to power our automobiles. And along those
###1201 lines, I think it's not going to be long before you're going to be able to drive an automobile
###1206 with new battery technologies that you can just plug in to your garage. And your automobile
###1211 won't look like a golf cart. It will be a normal size pickup truck. (Laughter and applause.)
###1224 So I laid out a goal that said we're going to reduce our gasoline usage by 20 percent
###1230 over 10 years as a part of our energy diversification strategy. And I think we can achieve that.
###1240 I also know we need to change our fuel economy standards just like we did for trucks, and
###1244 I want to work with Congress to do that as well.
###1246 In other words, it's part of a comprehensive strategy. I call it the 20-10 goal. And I
###1252 commend Congress for pursuing the framework for the 20-10 proposal. It's a promising start.
###1257 However, as bills get written, it's being frustrated by special interests and, of course,
###1262 all the politics that takes place in Washington, D.C.
###1266 The current plan being debated in the Senate falls far short of the ambitious goal I laid
###1272 out. But it's a realistic goal. It's a necessary goal if we want to become less dependent on
###1279 oil from overseas. The Senate's proposed fuel mandate, for example, calls for just a 10
###1285 percent reduction in gasoline usage by 2017. We can do much better than that. We really
###1290 can. We've got to be optimistic about what America can do when we put our mind to doing
###1295 something.
###1295 And so I urge the Congress to be realistic about the bills they're talking about and
###1303 get it done. Get it to my desk so we can all say we've done a good job of representing
###1309 the people.
###1310 By the way, as we talk about these new technologies, we're still going to need oil and gas. And
###1315 we can explore for oil and gas in environmentally friendly ways. I strongly believe that we
###1320 ought to open up more outer continental shelf area, as well as ANWR in Alaska. You know,
###1326 there's a big debate about whether or not you can drill and find oil and gas that's
###1332 good for you without ruining the environment. I'm telling you we can. Technologies have
###1336 changed. (Applause.)
###1338 By the way, when they're debating the bill up there, they've also got to fill up -- add
###1346 to the strategic petroleum reserve. If you're worried about a terrorist attack which could
###1352 affect the price of oil, we ought to have oil in the ground that we can use to protect
###1356 the American consumer. And they need to expand the petroleum reserve against natural disasters,
###1364 protection against natural disasters, as well as a potential attack.
###1369 By the way, the Supreme Court -- I don't know if you follow the Supreme Court at all, but
###1374 they've ruled that the EPA must take action under the Clean Air Act regarding greenhouse
###1378 gas emissions from motor vehicles. That's what the Court said. And when the Court says
###1384 something, then the executive branch of government says, okay, you said it, now we'll listen.
###1388 We'll do what you asked us to do.
###1390 And so I directed the EPA and the Department of Transportation, Energy, and Agriculture
###1396 to take the first steps toward regulations that would cut gasoline consumption and greenhouse
###1401 gases using the plan I just described to you. So Congress can pass the law, which I hope
###1407 they do, but if they don't, we're moving forward because the Supreme Court told us to move
###1411 forward. And either way, in either case, we're going to become less dependent on oil, and
###1416 that's good for the United States of America. (Applause.)
###1423 So I appreciate you letting me come by and talk a little energy. You live it, I'm talking
###1429 it. (Laughter.) I thank you for what you're doing for the country. I thank you for your
###1433 hard work, I thank you for your skill, I thank you for your prayers. I thank you for being
###1438 good Americans.
###1439 And may God bless you. And may God bless our country. Thank you all. (Applause.)
