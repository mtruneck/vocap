###1 STEVE SPANGLER: Welcome to Toy Fair 2012.
###5 So look at this.
###6 God, that's amazing.
###7 Oh, and it doesn't take much of a squeeze at all.
###10 You are now compressing some of the air
###11 that's in that packet.
###12 So I bet you think this is the part of the show where I'm
###14 going to say, don't try these experiments at home.
###17 And you're right, except there is one experiment
###19 we want you to try.
###20 Just look for the graphic that's right here
###22 that says try it.
###23 That's your signal that you can try that
###25 experiment at home.
###26 Everything else off limits.
###27 Look, I've already given you homework, and the show hasn't
###29 even started.
###31 I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all about making science fun.
###35 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###37 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###40 experiences.
###41 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###44 affect the way people think about science.
###47 And to do that, I live by one motto--
###49 "Make it big, do it right, give
###52 it class." All right.
###58 Watch this.
###59 There's a squid in the bottle--
###61 seriously.
###62 And you just take a hair like this-- it's a trained squid--
###64 and you wrap the hair around the squid.
###66 It's almost like a lasso.
###67 Hard to see.
###68 See I can kind of pull the little--
###69 here let him go.
###70 Just grab the hair, pull him down like this.
###72 And you can take him to the bottom and just pull the hair
###74 off, and he'll go right back up to the top, and--
###77 OK, that's not how it works.
###79 But it's the first science toy I ever invented.
###82 And some people will ask, so how does a science teacher own
###85 a toy company?
###85 And the reason why is because of that dumb squid in a bottle
###89 that goes up and down when you actually squeeze the bottle.
###91 This is it.
###92 It's the very, very first toy that started the toy company.
###95 And it's nothing more than an eye dropper and a hex nut and
###98 this little rubber piece that's the squid.
###101 And let me show you how easy it is to make the diver.
###104 Well, here are the pieces, parts that we're using today.
###105 I've got just some 1 liter bottles filled with water, a
###109 couple of deep containers, because we're going to need to
###111 do some things that sink and float.
###112 The original Cartesian diver, named after
###115 Rene Descartes, used--
###117 well, the original one, I'm sure used something other than
###120 glass eye droppers.
###121 The oldest one I can remember used a glass eye dropper.
###124 And today, you can still find them at stores like Walmart or
###127 wherever, a pharmacy.
###128 Let me show you how to do it with the original one.
###131 The whole idea is this.
###131 You have to get a container of water like this here, and you
###134 drop the eye dropper inside.
###136 And you say float or sink, and, of course, it floats.
###139 And it floats because there's air inside that eye dropper.
###141 Even though it's a glass eye dropper, there's air.
###144 If I hold it up like this-- here, take a look at this--
###146 I can squeeze some of the bubbles out like this, and
###149 pull some water in.
###150 So in essence, I'm changing the mass, right?
###153 And now it just barely bobs there.
###156 See how it bobs up and down that way?
###158 OK, so that's perfect.
###159 When you make a Cartesian diver, you've got to have that
###161 kind of set up there, so it just barely bounces around.
###164 Now we've got a 1 liter bottle.
###166 And I'm using a 1 liter.
###166 You could use a 2 liter.
###168 It's just easier to squeeze with a 1 liter.
###170 Remove the label.
###171 It's almost full to the top.
###173 And one of the secrets of a Cartesian diver, to make it
###175 easier to squeeze, anyway, is to make sure there's just no
###178 air inside the bottle.
###179 The only air that we want--
###181 if you take a look at this right here-- the only air that
###183 you want is the air that's in that Cartesian diver.
###186 All right.
###186 So now, here's what happens.
###187 You take a cap and put the cap on like this.
###191 And now, we're ready to go.
###193 So the way it floats and it sinks is if I can change the
###197 mass, ultimately changing the density-- if I can change the
###201 mass, because the volume is going to stay the same, then
###204 density equals mass divided by volume.
###206 I know it's nerd fest here, but I've just got to change
###209 the density so it's greater than 1 and so it will sink.
###212 So watch-- as I squeeze it, you can actually see the water
###215 level going up.
###216 You see this here?
###217 So I'm just barely squeezing it.
###219 So water's being pushed up into here.
###221 The air compresses, because the water cannot compress.
###224 And when it gets heavy enough, it finally sinks.
###226 Isn't that nice?
###227 And as you let go, it will float.
###230 So we've got a perfect way to be able to make something
###233 float or sink.
###234 And of course, we're just using our fingers to be able
###237 to squeeze it.
###238 You can do all the magic that you want to.
###239 You pretend like you have the magnetic finger.
###241 And when the person comes up, their finger follows.
###243 And if you just don't want the person to have the magnetic
###246 finger, then you just don't let them make it work, right?
###249 But that's the classic Cartesian diver.
###252 I was introduced to a new style of Cartesian diver by a
###255 man by the name of Bob Becker.
###257 Bob is a chemistry teacher in Kirkwood, Missouri, and
###260 actually showed me this version using plastic eye
###263 droppers called pipettes.
###265 And they're very, very prevalent in
###266 the chemistry classroom.
###268 A lot of teachers use these pipettes.
###270 They may be a little bit harder for just the average
###272 person to get their hands on, but just befriend a teacher,
###274 and for sure they know about pipettes.
###277 This one is special, because it's graduated.
###279 Do you see this one here?
###280 And when you're picking one, just make sure that you can
###282 find one that the hex nut will go over the top.
###286 So if I drop this into the water like this-- so here's
###290 our container.
###290 Let me drop this into the water.
###291 Of course it floats, right?
###294 I want to weight it down.
###295 So here's what we're going to do.
###296 We're taking a regular quarter-inch hex nut.
###299 And I use these brass ones, because they don't rust.
###302 This goes on the pipette like that.
###304 So here's what it looks like.
###306 It's just right there on the pipette.
###308 And then I'm going to twist and turn it into place like
###311 this, so it kind of holds it into place.
###314 And that's what it looks like.
###317 It's held into place.
###318 A pair of scissors will help us cut the end off.
###321 And now we have the makings of a modern-day Cartesian diver.
###325 So the same thing-- of course it floats.
###327 So watch.
###327 When we drop it inside, it floats.
###330 If I squeeze some of the air out and pull some of the water
###333 in, I can make it so it just barely floats.
###335 Of course, of we have too much water in altogether, then the
###338 whole thing will sink.
###339 So I want it so it just barely floats.
###341 So I'm going to just continue to play with it.
###344 That seems to be a pretty good buoyancy there.
###348 Again, that whole idea is so it just barely floats.
###350 So now that we have it adjusted, you just have to be
###352 careful that you don't get any of the water out.
###354 It goes down inside.
###355 Notice how it's full almost to the very, very top.
###358 That's exactly what we want--
###359 no air inside the bottle.
###361 And now we cap it off.
###362 Again, just as it happened before, that we saw with the
###365 glass eye dropper, when you squeeze, notice how the water
###368 goes up inside.
###369 This systems just works perfectly.
###371 Bob's a genius.
###372 And there is the making of the modern day Cartesian diver.
###378 We had to find a way to disguise
###380 this diver right here.
###381 I was working in television in the early 1990s for a program
###384 called News for Kids.
###386 And so on the set, we had a whole bunch of kids.
###388 And they were squeezing this.
###389 And the director kept on commenting that she couldn't
###393 see the diver very well inside.
###395 So we found other ways to be able to glue things on, for
###399 example, or use a Sharpie pen to color on them.
###402 Again, Bob Becker had a bunch of great ideas.
###405 But I wanted something that was just a little
###407 bit easier to see.
###408 So I'll show you how we changed everything.
###410 It looks like a fishing lure.
###412 It's not really a fishing lure that would catch a fish.
###415 These were specially made, because the regular fishing
###417 lure just wouldn't go over the pipette.
###419 Remember coming back and trying to find a way to be
###422 able to use this and put it over the pipette.
###424 So here, watch.
###425 This is Squiddy.
###426 So you just open up the little opening here like this.
###430 And then this slides over the workings of
###433 the squid like this.
###436 And this is the new squid.
###439 All right, so this is in place.
###441 Enough history.
###442 As you squeeze, the water goes inside, the little squid falls
###446 down, and as you let go, the squid goes up again.
###449 And that was Squiddy.
###451 So let's say you don't have a squid and you don't have
###454 pipettes and hex nuts and everything else and you'd like
###456 to do the Cartesian diver.
###457 I'm going to show you how to do one.
###458 This is ingenious.
###459 It's done out of a condiment.
###461 It's just ketchup.
###462 So you're going to start collecting
###463 some ketchup packets.
###465 This is an interesting Cartesian diver.
###468 And it's interesting because, in this style of Cartesian
###471 diver, there was an open end.
###472 So when you squeeze, water would go inside.
###475 You would increase the mass, and it would sink.
###477 But when you use something like this, these ketchup
###479 packets have never been opened.
###481 And so this means that the mass has to stay the same.
###484 We would have to possibly change the volume if you want
###487 to change the density.
###488 So here's what you need to do.
###489 Not all ketchup packets work.
###490 Collect a whole bunch of different ketchup packets and
###492 in a container of water, just drop them inside.
###495 Some will float, and some will sink.
###496 You're hoping that a couple will float.
###498 And pick the ones that will float.
###500 OK, so this is a good one here.
###502 This one may float just a little too much.
###505 And this one right over here, this Carl's Jr. one might do
###508 fairly well.
###509 So you want the two of them that just barely float.
###512 All right?
###513 The other ones are out of the question.
###515 So again, here's our bottle.
###516 Let's try that Carl's Jr. one.
###518 Let's see if this one works fairly well.
###520 So you're going to take the ketchup packet.
###522 Don't open it up.
###523 Just kind of fold it and push it down into the bottle.
###528 And you're going to lose some water, so you're going to have
###530 to fill it back up again.
###531 Ah, so there it is.
###532 Bingo.
###533 Got it.
###534 And now, cap it or top if off this way.
###537 And we need a cap.
###540 So this will go on the top.
###542 So now, look at what we have.
###543 This is fairly cool, because this now doesn't get ruined if
###548 you turn it upside down or anything like that.
###549 It just kind of sits in here.
###552 While you can't see it, as you squeeze--
###554 and it doesn't take much of a squeeze at all--
###557 you're now compressing some of the air that's in that packet
###560 and changing the density or the buoyancy.
###562 And that's the simplest of the Cartesian divers.
###567 Now that you know how Squiddy works-- a simple science toy--
###570 there's a big jump from having an idea like this to actually
###572 getting it into stores.
###573 And the best way to do that is a convention called the New
###576 York Toy Fair.
###577 It attracts thousands and thousands of people.
###580 These are people who own educational stores, regular
###583 toy stores.
###585 And that's the best way to be able to show people.
###587 Well, the product line has grown from just a couple
###589 products that we started with the 1993 to now over 75
###593 products in a company called Be Amazing!
###595 Toys.
###596 So I want to give you a behind the scenes glimpse of what Toy
###599 Fair looks like-- the normal public isn't allowed in-- and
###602 what happens when you walk the aisles and ask other people to
###606 show you some of their best toys, as well.
###608 Take a look.
###609 Well, it's cold for a reason.
###610 It's February in New York.
###612 It can only mean one thing--
###613 Toy Fair.
###614 And we'd like to have you help us out a little bit.
###616 So we want to comment below and tell us which toys we're
###618 going to show you are the great ones and which ones are
###620 kind of-- eh.
###621 Well, you be the judge.
###623 And welcome to Toy Fair 2012.
###629 All right.
###629 This is a sneak peak of Toy Fair.
###631 We're actually in the exhibit hall, because we're exhibitors
###634 today with Be Amazing!
###635 Toys.
###636 It's wonderful company they carries so many of the Steve
###639 Spangler science items.
###640 But they carry it for things like Target and Walmart and
###643 mass-market stores in addition to small ma and pa stores.
###647 Those brick and mortar stores are there as well.
###649 And this is where I get to hang out for
###651 the next eight hours.
###653 And I have a feeling-- see these hands?
###655 They are going to be coke-covered here in no time,
###658 because it's my job to launch as many geysers as I can.
###661 I have 780 bottles to get through.
###663 And it'll be a successful day if I get it.
###666 See ya.
###667 
###673 Now, when I pull the pin, the Mentos will fall, just like
###676 the model here, right?
###678 The secret is that those little pits on the outside of
###681 the Mentos, all the carbon dioxide rushes to that--
###684 they're called nucleation points-- and it
###686 shoots the soda out.
###687 We're just going to turn it sideways, see if Isaac Newton
###689 was correct.
###690 And if he was, we get a little shot.
###692 All right?
###692 So this goes in here like this.
###695 All right, normally you're outside or you're sneaking in
###697 some place that has great floors like Home Depot.
###700 You'd shoot it all past plumbing and down the--
###702 don't do that.
###703 This pulls like this when it falls.
###705 It starts to flow.
###706 And as you let go, bam!
###708 Isn't that a good shot?
###709 That was.
###710 It'll go about 150 feet at about 30 miles an hour with
###714 what you saw there.
###716 Now that we're done at the booth, let's go check out some
###718 of the cool toys at Toy Fair.
###721 Who doesn't like a severed hand that runs around on a
###724 wall and scares the crap out of kids?
###726 That's perfect.
###727 
###733 You know, of anybody doing science kits today, Thames &
###736 Kosmos has got to be one of my favorites and one of the best.
###739 You look at this-- they're doing real science.
###741 The materials that you see here are not watered down.
###743 So if you're looking for chemistry along the way, this
###746 Thames & Kosmos place is great.
###748 MALE SPEAKER: Straw with flavored beads in the middle.
###752 STEVE SPANGLER: Lobster?
###753 Is it lobster?
###754 MALE SPEAKER: That's it.
###756 STEVE SPANGLER: Shrimp?
###756 MALE SPEAKER: Taste it again.
###756 Maybe let the beads dissolve a little bit more.
###758 You're not quite getting the flavor.
###760 Now what do you think?
###761 STEVE SPANGLER: Strawberry.
###761 MALE SPEAKER: Strawberry, you got it.
###762 STEVE SPANGLER: Strawberry lobster.
###762 It actually tastes like strawberry lobster and shrimp.
###765 Well, we're at Insect Lore.
###766 These are people that I've known for years
###767 and years and years.
###768 And there, they manufacture this wonderful thing called
###771 the butterfly pavilion.
###772 And so I would stand in their booth years ago and tell
###775 people that the butterflies were good to eat, and they
###777 were just raising them for salads.
###778 And a lot of people would believe that.
###780 And then I got kicked out.
###782 Do not eat the butterflies.
###783 
###786 I thought it was just all about buying bugs.
###788 And now it's a campfire.
###789 MALE SPEAKER: Now it's all about camping.
###791 STEVE SPANGLER: OK, go away.
###792 I need to get in the camp.
###793 MALE SPEAKER: It's time for bed.
###794 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, so here's kind of a you choose it
###796 an adventure.
###796 You can choose what you want me to do.
###798 I'll either A, go sneak into the tent at Insect Lore and
###803 sleep there for the night, or B, I'll pretend like I'm a
###806 sales person, and I'll sell butterflies, but convince
###809 people that they're not real and they're animatronics.
###810 
###823 All right, well, 3D is all the rage.
###824 And these are 3D glasses here from Look3D.
###828 And not only are they 3D glasses, they make you look
###831 really sexy.
###832 And watch this, I can look--
###833 oh my god.
###835 See that?
###836 All contained in these classes here.
###838 No batteries at all.
###839 How many pounds?
###839 MALE SPEAKER: This is 25 pounds.
###841 STEVE SPANGLER: All right.
###841 25 pounds of Aaron's Thinking Putty.
###843 It changes color.
###845 This is a tremendous amount of fun.
###847 I don't think he was a problem in school at all.
###850 This is just what he does.
###852 MALE SPEAKER: We're going to turn that
###853 nice lady into a butterfly.
###855 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, let's go see the butterfly.
###858 How cool is that?
###859 MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].
###860 
###867 STEVE SPANGLER: That is awesome and tasty too.
###871 Tastes like that lobster stuff that I had at the other booth.
###873 Look at this.
###875 MALE SPEAKER: When you spread out your fingers, they weave
###876 in and out.
###876 Here, we'll show them his nose.
###878 Oh, he's scared.
###879 Put it on your shower door, it turns your whole
###881 shower into a speaker.
###883 STEVE SPANGLER: You're using the entire box to just
###884 resonate the sound.
###886 Here's a booth--
###887 four million different kinds of dice.
###890 
###900 So here's the deal.
###901 This nice man right here said that I can go sneak a toy away
###905 during a live shot.
###906 So they wrote something like "Hello, Denver" or something.
###909 But during the live shot, we'll go sneak it away and
###911 just see how he reacts.
###912 He's good.
###913 So he'll react well.
###914 CHRIS BYRNE: And you know who's running around here?
###915 Steve Spangler's running around Toy Fair creating all
###917 kinds of havoc.
###918 And I-- wait, there he is.
###920 STEVE SPANGLER: I'm taking this back to the station.
###921 CHRIS BYRNE: He's taking it back to the station.
###923 So we are having so much fun here at the American
###925 International Toy Fair.
###926 So great to see you.
###927 STEVE SPANGLER: You too.
###927 There's the regular--
###928 there's six things on a die.
###931 And then there's this one that's red.
###932 And this one, it's another die, which looks a lot like
###935 this one, but it's completely called the swirl die.
###937 And this is the gator die and the pearl die.
###940 This would be the cow die, the dog die, and the woodland
###943 animal die--
###944 not to be confused with the bison die, the beetle die, the
###946 scorpion die, and the ladybug die.
###948 One of my favorites--
###949 the bat die.
###950 There's the sided die-- the 16-sided die.
###953 There's the hip dice, Chinese dice, Amish dice, regular
###957 dice, Japanese dice, and another alien dice which is
###959 probably a knock-off of that alien dice over there.
###962 There's spotted, spotted, spotted, counting.
###964 There's loaded dice, just in case you have a craps game and
###967 you want to win--
###968 loaded dice.
###969 Nothing says I love you more, kids, than to give you a bowl
###972 of dice for your birthday.
###974 Happy birthday.
###974 Here's a bowl of dice.
###976 My all time favorite-- you can vote on it down below--
###979 opaque die.
###980 
###983 One question we never get to ask-- what do you think about
###985 alligators?
###987 
###989 And do you have any thoughts on the current debate over
###992 endoplasmic reticulum?
###995 MALE SPEAKER: I'll show you just a quick trick here.
###996 You've got a ring now, right?
###997 STEVE SPANGLER: Right.
###997 MALE SPEAKER: If I squeeze them together,
###998 now I've got a triangle.
###1000 If I fold up the tips, I've got an octahedron.
###1003 I can put it back down and smash it and it goes right
###1005 back into a ring.
###1005 STEVE SPANGLER: Nice.
###1006 MALE SPEAKER: Now, pinch here, fold it over, and I've got
###1008 myself a spinning top.
###1010 And if I add two, I get eight.
###1011 Eight's a cool number.
###1013 I known to be two times two times two, or two cubed.
###1017 Just like that.
###1018 Now, I'll show you a really cool trick.
###1021 It requires 12.
###1022 So I'm going to add four more here.
###1024 And 12's a really interesting number, because it allows me
###1026 to just wrap them around my fingers twice.
###1028 STEVE SPANGLER: Right.
###1028 MALE SPEAKER: Pinch here, and I pull these two to the side.
###1031 Now I've got myself a ball.
###1033 STEVE SPANGLER: God, that's amazing.
###1036 [STEVE, POORLY, PLAYING "CLOSE TO YOU" ON UKELELE]
###1038 
###1047 STEVE SPANGLER: It's out of tune.
