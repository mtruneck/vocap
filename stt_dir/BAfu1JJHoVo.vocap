###4 It's just all she seems to talk about is this bloody dog, you know ?
###8 It's like "Ooh, Colin did this" and "Ooh, Colin did that",
###11 and I'm sick of it, you know ?
###13 I should talk to her, but she's been so happy ever since Colin arrived on the scene.
###17 She'd been having a hard time.
###19 She'd had some articles rejected, she'd split up with her boyfriend.
###22 To top it all off, her hair looked stupid all the time.
###25 Then Colin arrives on the scene and she's writing again.
###28 She doesn't seem that bothered about Richard and her hair looks good !
###37 Tim, I know how you feel about dogs and I know how you feel about Daisy.
###41 Sometimes, where friends are concerned, sacrifices have to be made.
###45 You're saying we kill the dog ?
###48 - No. - Spoilsport.
###51 - Count to 100 ? - All right.
###54 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
###70 <i>I used to know this guy Minty,</i>
###73 <i>He had a dog who he'd train to attack rich people,</i>
###78 <i>He was into the whole class-war thing,</i>
###80 <i>He called the dog Gramsci after an Italian Marxist,</i>
###84 <i>Rumour has it, it could smell wealth from up to 20 feet,</i>
###90 <i>The thing is, it all backfired, Minty won 100 grand on a scratchcard,,,</i>
###96 <i>and Gramsci bit his knees off,</i>
###102 That's terrible.
###104 Not really. He used the money to buy new knees.
###110 So what happened to Gramsci, then ?
###112 Well, no-one knows, although some people still believe
###117 he roams wild on Hampstead Heath.
###120 Close to the meat.
###124 Hiya !
###131 - Is that it ? - Well, it's not what it is.
###133 It's what it will be - a cold-blooded killer.
###138 It's a fact, sure as day follows night, sure as eggs is eggs,
###141 sure as every odd-numbered Star Trek movie is shit.
###144 - Ahhh ! - Mwah !
###147 - I'm going shopping. Do you want anything ? - A crossbow ?
###150 And also, if Richard calls,
###153 tell him I'm out with Colin.
###156 We'll make him pay, won't we ? We'll make them all pay.
###160 - Who's Richard ? - Ex-boyfriend.
###162 - Your ex-boyfriend ? - No, Daisy's ex-boyfriend.
###164 - My ex-boyfriend. - Oh, I'm sorry. What happened ?
###167 Well, you know, I was upset but I'm not any more, you know.
###171 In the end, our relationship was just like a sandwich toaster.
###174 You know, you forget you've got one.
###178 It just sits on top of the cupboard collecting a layer of greasy fudge.
###180 If you see it, you assume it's broken, otherwise you'd be using it all the time,
###185 but you don't and it just sits there.
###187 Then one day, you get an overwhelming desire for toasted sandwiches
###191 and you get it down and it works and you can't believe it, you know.
###195 You make every kind of sandwich there is, you have toasted-sandwich parties.
###199 You make Marmite and cheese and chocolate and...
###201 - Pilchards. - Banana and...
###203 - Acorns. - Acorns.
###205 Then as quickly as desire comes, it just goes,
###208 and then you put the toasted-sandwich maker away
###212 - and... you know what ? - What ?
###217 You don't miss it.
###219 So what you're saying is "Don't hide the toasted-sandwich maker away,
###224 use him regularly and you'll get the most out of him."
###226 No, she's saying "Chuck your boyfriend, have a sandwich."
###229 Anyway, I've got to go cos I'm meeting Twist.
###234 Don't you just love my hair ?
###303 How can you not like him ? He's so cute.
###306 Ahh !
###308 That's how it all starts, with "Oohs" and "Aahs", but later there's barking and biting.
###314 He's a ticking timebomb of death, Daisy.
###316 You give him all the love in the world, you spend years doting on his little furry head
###321 and one day you get back from aerobics and there he is,
###324 panting over the half-eaten remains of some hapless handyman
###327 you left fixing the tumble dryer.
###329 We don't have a tumble dryer.
###332 You will, my friend, you will.
###335 Look, Tim, I know that I've been... insensitive, OK,
###340 and I do appreciate that you are riddled with deep-seated psychological disorders.
###344 Thank you.
###345 But Colin lives here now and I'd like it if we could all live happily, you know ?
###350 - Your mum remarried, didn't she ? - What's that got to do with anything ?
###353 Well,... you know what it feels like to be...
###357 to be a stepchild,
###359 to be resented by a patriarch.
###362 My stepdad was a nice guy !
###369 Timmy boy !
###374 All right, I'll give it a try.
###377 Thanks, Tim.
###379 - So, what are you doing tonight ? - Brian's coming up.
###383 To see you ?
###384 I went to a gallery with him last week, so he's coming up to see the Star Wars Trilogy.
###388 It's like a cultural exchange thing.
###390 Do you mind if we sit in ? We could be like independent observers.
###395 No, not at all. I'll get some popcorn. And a muzzle.
###408 Ooh ! Sorry, mate.
###411 You idiot. Why don't you watch where you're going ?
###414 Takes the fun out of it.
###417 I just know this street well. I've never seen an evil, suspicious-Iooking man here before.
###421 What makes you think I'm evil and suspicious-Iooking ?
###424 All right ! I was just being friendly.
###439 It's so moving.
###445 Little Ewoks.
###448 An entire empire brought to its knees by small furry creatures.
###454 - That's my point exactly. - Leave him alone.
###458 Did you notice that everything that transpired in those films, and I mean everything,
###462 can be attributed to the actions of one very minor character ?
###466 Who ?
###467 The gunner on the Star Destroyer at the beginning of the first film.
###470 How come ?
###472 Well, if the gunner had shot the pod that C-3PO and R2 were in,
###477 they wouldn't have got to Tatooine, they wouldn't have met Luke,
###479 Luke wouldn't have met Ben, they wouldn't have met Han and Chewie,
###481 they wouldn't have rescued Princess Leia - none of it would have happened.
###484 Chaos theory.
###487 - Eh ? - The predictability of random events,
###490 the notion that reality as we know it - past, present, future -
###493 is in fact a mathematically predictable preordained system.
###499 So somewhere out there in the vastness of the unknown
###503 is an equation...
###506 for predicting the future ?
###508 An equation so complex as to utterly defy any possibility of comprehension
###513 by even the most brilliant human mind,
###517 but an equation nonetheless.
###522 - Oh, my God. - What ?
###525 What ?
###526 I've got some fucking Jaffa Cakes in my coat pocket.
###530 Oh, Mama !
###532 Oh, Daddy, let's all play kabaddi.
###533 - You get 'em, Daise. - I made the tea.
###536 I opened the window. Brian, it's your turn to do something.
###539 - Colin needs to go out for a walk. - I opened the window.
###543 Yeah, I made the tea and Brian's getting the Jaffa Cakes.
###546 Shit !
###547 It'll give you a chance to get to know each other.
###551 All right, all right, I'll do it, if it'll make you happy.
###554 Come on, then, Cujo, or whatever your bloody name is.
###557 Stay away from me, mind. Go on.
###577 What's the matter with you ? Just do your thing.
###581 Just do it. Do it. Just go, will you ?
###585 Oh, right. Well, hurry up.
###592 Come on, you bastards. I know you're up there.
###596 Come and get me. Take me to your homeworld.
###599 Come on, abduct me !
###604 Shit ! Colin's been abducted !
###606 - What do you mean, he's been abducted ? - Yeah, by a crocodile or something.
###610 - A crocodile ? ! - Or something.
###616 <i>- You let him go, didn't you ? - Wha... ? !</i>
###620 - Daisy, I'm sure Tim... - No, Brian !
###622 He's had it in for him from the start.
###626 Now, Daisy, I admit I wasn't keen on the idea of getting a dog,
###629 but I would never stoop so low as to do something like that.
###632 - I think you know me well enough. - Do I ?
###634 Daisy !
###635 I obviously don't know you as well as I thought !
###645 Ow.
###657 Do you want a Jaffa Cake ?
###659 No.
###661 I can't believe she'd think that.
###663 She's upset and not thinking straight.
###665 People say things they don't mean in those situations,
###668 she's just lashing out at someone close to her.
###671 Thanks, mate.
###673 It's all right.
###676 <i>So what did you do with it, then ?</i>
###686 Colin !
###688 Colin !
###690 - Colin ! - Colin !
###710 Colin ! Colin !
###726 Colin ! Colin ! Colin !
###729 Col... Oh, I'm sorry,
###732 I thought you were someone else.
###735 Colin !
###739 - Colin ! - Colin !
###741 - Colin ! - Colin !
###744 Come on, you little... Colin.
###759 - Any luck ? - No.
###762 This came.
###767 "To whom it may concern, I'm writing to inform you of the whereabouts of your dog."
###772 "Colin has been taken by a man named James Eldridge, a freelance vivisectionist."
###776 "I cannot return your dog personally, but the lab site is located 11-13 Kettle Road, N1."
###781 "Colin is being kept in Terrapin 5."
###783 "The lab has a skeleton security staff of one."
###786 "I hope this information is of use to you. Yours in search of justice,...
###790 ..a friend."
###794 This came with it.
###798 Call Twist, get Brian, I'll get Mike.
###800 - What are you gonna do ? - We're gonna get our dog back.
###824 I'd like to thank you all for coming. Daisy and me, we...
###829 We really appreciate it. We all know this is gonna be tough.
###833 - Do you want a Bourbon ? - Ooh, thanks very much.
###836 One of our number is in trouble and we have to help.
###838 Thanks to the information obtained by Mike,
###841 - Hello. - ..we've got a rough idea of the lab's layout.
###844 The main gate is here, the guard hut is here,
###847 and Terrapin 5, where we believe Colin is being held, is here.
###852 We'll go over the fence here. It's two metres high, so we'll have to do some climbing.
###855 - It's impossible. - It's not impossible.
###857 I used to climb over my neighbour's fence when I was a kid. It was about two metres.
###861 - Mike and Brian will handle the guard. - Why Mike and Brian ?
###865 Because you're tallest and Mike's good at handling people.
###867 Brian's not bad at handling people, are you, Brian ?
###874 Once inside, Daisy, Twist and myself will locate Terrapin 5.
###877 When we find it, Daisy and Twist will stand guard and I'll go in for Colin.
###881 - Why are you going in ? - Because I'm the one that lost him.
###886 I want you all wearing black tonight.
###888 <i>- All black ? - All black.</i>
###890 I don't know much about security lighting,
###892 but I'm guessing they'll use 180-degree dispersing halogens with motion sensors,
###896 so we'll have to stick to the shadows. Any questions ?
###899 - Are charcoal-grey pumps OK ? - Yes, they'll be fine.
###902 If we get separated, we'll meet at the Beech Tree Inn on Stone Street.
###905 Brian, put your hand down. Mike, I'll see you here at 2200 hours,
###909 everybody else, I'll see you here at ten.
###925 That's very...
###927 - That's very good, Mike. - Ta.
###934 Well done, Daisy.
###937 - You've done really well, Twist. - It's from the DKNY open-warfare range.
###941 - Well, great. Well done. What's this ? - It's my make-up bag.
###945 We're rescuing a dog from an animal-testing laboratory - there'll be lots of make-up there.
###948 - Oh, it's for luck. - Twist...
###950 Tim !
###952 Let her take it.
###954 OK.
###955 When we get there, it's important while we're doing this we don't use our real names.
###959 From now on, we'll be using code names, OK ?
###962 Mike, you're Luke.
###963 Brian, you're Chewie.
###964 Daisy, you're Leia.
###965 Twist,... you're... Jabba.
###968 - I'm Han. - Can't I be Han ?
###970 No !
###972 - Sound off. Luke ? - Ho.
###974 - Chewie ? - Erm, me.
###975 - Leia ? - Yes, Tim... Han.
###977 - Jabba ? - Is Jabba the princess ?
###978 Yeah. - Here !
###980 OK. Let's go get Colin.
###987 Brian ?
###989 Come back in one piece.
###991 Yep.
###994 You know what piece I mean.
###1024 OK, this is it, people. None of us have ever done anything like this before,
###1028 apart from Mike who, as we all know, once stole a tank and tried to invade Paris.
###1032 - Hello. - We're through the looking glass here, OK ?
###1035 We've been given a responsibility and if we don't do this, nobody else will.
###1040 Good luck, and I'll see you at the Beech.
###1042 Go ! Go ! Go !
###1050 - Oo-ooh ! - What are you doing ?
###1053 The gate's open.
###1066 Erm, excuse me.
###1071 Excuse me.
###1076 Excuse me !
###1078 Let's play.
###1093 OK, this is it. Stand guard. If it gets pear-shaped, just go.
###1096 Han !
###1098 - Good luck. - You too, Princess.
###1100 Thanks !
###1113 You must get terrible headaches looking at the screens all day long.
###1117 Oh, it's all right, really.
###1119 I find if I keep a little bottle of eye drops handy,
###1123 it's not too bad, really.
###1126 You should get one of those eye masks with the cooling gel in. I find them very soothing.
###1131 Oh, that sounds nice, yeah.
###1147 Colin ? Colin !
###1149 Colin !
###1151 What if they set the dogs on us ?
###1154 Don't worry, Twist. We trap 'em. Ahh-ah, ahh-ah, ahh-ah !
###1158 - Shh ! - Sorry.
###1170 Colin ? Colin !
###1172 I'm risking a lot being here, you know.
###1175 You're only doing it cos you fancy Chewie.
###1178 - Brian ? ! - Yeah.
###1180 - Uh-uh. - Uh-huh.
###1181 - Uh-uh ! - Nn !
###1183 - Uh-uh ! - Eh-eh-eh !
###1197 Colin !
###1199 Ahh !
###1201 You stay back, OK, I'm coming in.
###1205 Italian make, 9mm parabellum, 13 in the clip, one in the spout.
###1210 Kill zone. Feel that.
###1213 That, my friend, will mash up through the engine block of a Fiat Uno, no problem.
###1219 - How's it feel ? - It's so cold.
###1224 You're always wiggling your arse when he's around.
###1226 - I do not ! - You do, I've seen you.
###1229 Yes, well, what about you and "Han" ?
###1232 Tim ? !
###1234 What about me and Tim ?
###1236 - Run ! - Colin !
###1243 Come on !
###1246 Er, 14 across, three letters - "To walk at speed, manage or oversee."
###1253 - Run ! - Bye.
###1254 No, wait !
###1261 - We're stuck ! - Do something with it.
###1263 No, you're all right, Officer. Must have been a fox or something set off the motion sensors.
###1268 No, everything's fine. You stay where you are.
###1276 There you go. There's, erm, a bit of a knack to it.
###1281 It was you who sent the letter, wasn't it ?
###1284 - Yeah. - Why ?
###1288 Well, Eldridge left one of the Portakabins open last week.
###1291 I couldn't believe it, all those little animals in cages.
###1295 I'd never have taken the job if I knew what he was up to, but...
###1299 I knew he'd clean away any evidence if I went through the official channels,
###1304 and when Colin arrived, I saw my chance.
###1307 See, I... I've always been a bit of a yes man, you see.
###1312 Have you ?
###1315 Yeah. So I thought it was time I just stood up and said no.
###1322 Aren't you worried about getting in trouble with the police, being involved in a break-in ?
###1326 It won't look very good on your permanent record, will it ?
###1329 There's not much I can do about that, is there ?
###1332 Wait a minute, everyone. I've got an idea.
###1336 What ?
###1338 Voilа !
###1341 Blimey.
###1343 There you go - it wasn't your fault, we beat you up.
###1351 Hey, I suppose I'd better call the police, then, eh ?
###1358 - You lot had better get off. - Right.
###1364 Colin says thanks. "Thanks !"
###1366 - "Bye !" -Bye.
###1372 Daisy, look at this.
###1373 "Scientist James Eldridge, wanted by police for his involvement in an illegal laboratory,
###1379 is missing today."
###1380 "Eldridge, whose nefarious dealings may have earnt him in excess of Ј250,000,
###1385 was last seen on Tuesday near Hampstead Heath."
###1388 <i>Hampstead Heath, Hampstead Heath,</i>
###1390 <i>Close to the meat, Hampstead Heath,</i>
###1393 <i>He roams wild on Hampstead Heath, Hampstead Heath,</i>
###1399 Hello ?
###1401 Is anyone there ?
###1405 I can assure you, this isn't the least bit amusing.
