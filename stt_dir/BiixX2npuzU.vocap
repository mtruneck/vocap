###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: It is Friday, which is awesome. It`s the end of the week, end
###4 of the month and the start of a new day of CNN STUDENT NEWS. Hello, everyone. My name
###8 is Carl Azuz. Let`s go in and get started.
###23 Permanent observer -- or non-member observer state -- now they might not sound like much
###29 of a difference between those two terms, but if you ask some Palestinian officials, the
###33 difference is huge. Yesterday, the United Nations voted to upgrade the status of the
###38 Palestinian Authority. Palestinian officials had been pushing for this. They think it will
###43 give them some leverage in negotiating with Israel, but Israel and the United States have
###48 been against this upgrade, they argue that it won`t have much of an effect on efforts
###53 to create a Middle East peace deal.
###55 When you hear about drones, unmanned aircraft you might think about them flying over Afghanistan.
###61 These are remote controlled vehicles, and they are used a lot by the U.S. military in
###65 the fight against terrorism. But drones could start popping up in the skies over the United
###69 States. Lisa Sylvester looks at the capabilities and the concerns that might come along for
###75 the ride.
###75 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###76 LISA SYLVESTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Right now, only groups with special FAA permission, like
###80 the U.S. Customs and Border Protection can operate drones in the United States, but that
###85 is going to change: Congress has asked the Federal Aviation Administration to find a
###90 safe way to expand the use of drones, or unmanned aerial systems domestically.
###94 BEN WIITTES, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: The bottom line is that by 2015, the FAA has to have
###101 a comprehensive plan to open the air space to both public and private UAS.
###108 SYLVESTER: Think of the potential from crop dusting to news traffic reports to surveilling
###116 land to monitoring forest fires.
###122 There is a big industry pushing the federal government to open up the skies arguing these
###127 unmanned air craft systems are safer and less expensive.
###131 SYLVESTER: Unmanned aerial vehicles or drones can be as large as a fighter jet or only just
###137 a couple of feet long, and people have actually been flying unmanned vehicles or even model
###142 airplanes for years, but with certain restrictions. They can`t fly them above 400 feet, or in
###147 certain areas like airports without running into problems with FAA.
###152 That brings us to one of the problems the FAA is trying to solve: how to ensure safety
###157 if the sky suddenly become a lot more crowded.
###160 KEVIN HIATT, FIGHT SAFETY FOUNDATION: Some of the larger concerns are the construction
###163 of the aircraft. Who`s piloting them? The actual bandwidth. Also, taking a look at some
###169 of those social issues, which we`ve all started to look into as far as privacy.
###174 SYLVESTER: It`s the privacy peace that Representative Edward Markey is most concerned about: could
###178 prying paparazzi hound celebrities? When can drones be used by law enforcement to gather
###184 evidence? And what about the information gathered by the drones?
###187 REP. EDWARD MARKEY, (D ), MASSACHUSETTS: Is it possible that this is just going to be
###190 a rampant, eyes in the sky gathering information about Americans with no rules, whatsoever.
###198 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###199 AZUZ: During the 2012 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney only came face
###204 to face four times: they had their three debates and a fundraising dinner. On election night,
###211 President Obama suggested another get together:
###213 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###213 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: In the weeks ahead, I also look
###216 forward to sitting down with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to
###221 move this country forward.
###222 AUDIENCE: Yes!
###223 (applause)
###224 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###225 AZUZ: That meeting happened yesterday. The former opponents got together for lunch at
###229 the White House. Now, we don`t know exactly what was sad, there were no news media allowed.
###234 But a White House statement said President Obama and Governor Romney talked about America`s
###239 role in the world. And they promised to stay in touch with each other.
###243 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: See, if you can I.D. me.
###248 I was born in Germany in 1879. In my early life, I worked in the Swiss patent office.
###255 But I`m known as a famous physicist. And in 1921 I won the Nobel Prize for physics.
###263 I`m Albert Einstein. And you`ve probably heard about my theory of relativity.
###270 AZUZ: When a Nobel prize came up with the theory of relativity, it`s no wonder that
###278 a lot of people think of Einstein as a genius. And that`s why there is a lot interest in
###282 the organ that did Einstein`s thinking: his brain. Some photographs were published recently
###287 that show Einstein`s brain after he died. Scientists were eager to get a look and see
###293 if there were any clues to the famous Germans genius. Doctor Sanjay Gupta has more on this.
###298 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###299 DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Let me just say as a starting point. You know, for
###302 the last nearly half century now, people have been fascinated with trying to figure out
###306 what it was about Einstein brain that might be different. And let`s take a look at these
###310 images. Here, it`s a good place to start, specifically looking at all those ridges and
###315 valleys on the brain. These convolutions that are sort of -- they develop as the brain is
###320 developing as someone ages.
###321 What do we know about his brain is that he had more of these ridges and valleys. And
###326 the reason that`s significant is you just think about that -- as the result of those
###330 increased ridges and valleys and convolutions, you get more surface area. You get more neurons
###335 and you have more capacity for different parts of the brain to talk to each other.
###339 It doesn`t necessarily means someone`s going to be more intelligent, I think it`s best
###342 to say that they have the capacity for higher intelligence because of that increased surface
###347 area neurons.
###347 There is also a couple of other things that people really honed in on, again, in terms
###351 of differences. Take a look at this image over here. That`s frontal lobe area, and in
###356 most people whose brains have been examined that area of the brain is fused, but if you
###361 look at that red line there, that`s an area of the brain of Albert Einstein where it was
###365 actually split. This is an executive area of the brain. This is where you implement
###369 things, get things done. He had a higher executive sort of capability there.
###374 Again, it doesn`t necessarily correlate directly with intelligence, but it does correlate with
###377 this idea that if you have significant thoughts, to be able to do something with those could
###383 be -- you could have a greater capacity for that.
###385 A lot of people ask, you know, what does it mean for us? Could my brain be like Einstein?
###388 There is more (inaudible) things that he was born with. There are certain areas of the
###392 brain like look at this area over here that`s sort of upside down a horse shoe. That`s an
###396 area of the brain that`s responsible typically for motor control of the hand. In this case,
###400 the left hand. And now you`d look at that area and you realize it, because it`s bigger
###404 like that, it`s typically associated with someone who`s very good with their hands.
###408 In this case, Einstein was a musician, played the violin.
###411 But that is not something that people are born with. That is something that develops.
###414 And that gives us a little bit of an insight into other parts of his brain as well that
###419 may have increased in size, may have increased in capacity as a result of all the work that
###423 he was doing. It`s fascinating stuff. Back to you.

###428 HIILLARY CLINTON, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Make no mistake about it - - HIV may well
###433 be with us into the future, but the disease that it causes, need not be.
###440 We can reach a point where virtually no children are born with the virus and as these children
###447 become teenagers and adults, they are at a far lower risk of becoming infected than they
###455 are today.
###457 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###461 AZUZ: You heard Secretary Clinton mention the disease that HIV causes. She`s talking
###466 about AIDS, which stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Tomorrow, December First is world
###472 AIDS day. It`s the time to support the millions of people living with these disease and honor
###476 those who have lost their lives to it.
###478 Around 34 million people around the world have AIDS. New cases are recorded every year.
###483 But the number of new cases is decreasing. And yesterday, Secretary Clinton announced
###488 a plan that aims to get rid of AIDS, but focuses on preventing the spread of the disease and
###493 improving treatment for people who have it.
###495 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###495 CLINTON: Thank you all very much.

###498 AZUZ: "CNN Heroes": ordinary people doing extraordinary things to make a difference
###501 in their communities. We know who this year`s top ten are on Sunday night and all-star tribute
###506 honors them and announces the hero of the year. A special program starts at 8 p.m. Eastern
###511 on CNN. Then the CNN "Heroes " tribute as it 9 Eastern, 6 central. It`s this Sunday,
###518 so check it out.
###521 When you step off an airplane you might hope to be greeted by a friendly face. Not this
###527 one. It`s what visitors to Wellington, New Zealand are coming face to face with for a
###532 few months, though. Gollum can be a larger than life character in the "Lord of the Rings"
###537 and the "Hobbit" movies. And at this airport, he`s just larger than a life. The 43 foot
###542 sculpture -- it`s 43 feet high, and it`s part of a publicity campaign, but it`s only going
###548 to be up for a while. So we don`t think this kind of thing is going to be habitual. Now,
###552 I don`t think anybody is going to make the mistake of calling it cute, although some
###555 might see it as precious. Calling it that, though, would take some Gollum. We know these
###559 puns will get a ringing endorsement for some of you , but we really only have two options:
###563 more, door -- we`re just going to baggins them. Those of you who follow the "Lord of
###568 the Rings" are like OK, OK, the rest of you like. So we`re just going to end in there.
###571 We`ll see you next Monday with more news and more puns. Bye now.
