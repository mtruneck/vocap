0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:15,51



2
0:0:15,51 --> 0:0:18,21
THOMAS MORTON: We're in the
goat house, basically.


3
0:0:18,21 --> 0:0:22,2
It's like a farmhouse
kind of on the


4
0:0:22,2 --> 0:0:22,782
other side of the mountain.


5
0:0:22,782 --> 0:0:25,0
We slept here.


6
0:0:25,0 --> 0:0:27,35
It's just from yesterday, this
kind of felt like a third


7
0:0:27,35 --> 0:0:30,45
grade slumber party.


8
0:0:30,45 --> 0:0:31,939
God, it's like the
whole fucking


9
0:0:31,939 --> 0:0:33,51
yard is an alarm clock.


10
0:0:33,51 --> 0:0:39,5



11
0:0:39,5 --> 0:0:42,2
The day after PJAK's birthday,
we finally headed up to the


12
0:0:42,2 --> 0:0:44,255
mountains to meet the female
division we'd be fighting


13
0:0:44,255 --> 0:0:47,695
with, or at least hanging
out with.


14
0:0:47,695 --> 0:0:51,23
The one-hour car trip across
one hill we were promised


15
0:0:51,23 --> 0:0:54,9
turned out to be a nine-hour
journey that involved numerous


16
0:0:54,9 --> 0:1:3,44
hills, numerous stops to get
the truck out of the mud,


17
0:1:3,44 --> 0:1:7,52
possibly took us across the
Iranian border at some point,


18
0:1:7,52 --> 0:1:9,38
and required a magic
[INAUDIBLE]


19
0:1:9,38 --> 0:1:10,63
with the fourth and
final river.


20
0:1:10,63 --> 0:1:32,24



21
0:1:32,24 --> 0:1:33,16
This is it.


22
0:1:33,16 --> 0:1:36,8
We just met the guys who are
going to be hanging out with


23
0:1:36,8 --> 0:1:39,68
us, and they took our cell
phones so we can't sext while


24
0:1:39,68 --> 0:1:40,32
we're here.


25
0:1:40,32 --> 0:1:43,2
I kind of expected it to be kind
of buried in the trees


26
0:1:43,2 --> 0:1:48,28
and covered with those weird
perforated leaf things they


27
0:1:48,28 --> 0:1:50,3
put on helicopters and stuff.


28
0:1:50,3 --> 0:1:53,82
This is pretty out in the open,
I guess, just incredibly


29
0:1:53,82 --> 0:1:55,7
impossible to get to is all.


30
0:1:55,7 --> 0:1:59,71



31
0:1:59,71 --> 0:2:2,15
We took a short hike up the hill
to our soldiers' camp and


32
0:2:2,15 --> 0:2:3,68
ran another awkward
handshake line.


33
0:2:3,68 --> 0:2:8,74



34
0:2:8,74 --> 0:2:10,975
This particular PJAK division
fights for women's rights in


35
0:2:10,975 --> 0:2:13,85
and around the Iranian border.


36
0:2:13,85 --> 0:2:16,42
Thankfully, after a grueling
morning trek, we caught them


37
0:2:16,42 --> 0:2:19,685
just as they were sitting
down for tea.

0:2:19,685 --> 0:2:21,7
FEMALE SPEAKER:

39
0:2:21,7 --> 0:2:40,51



40
0:2:40,51 --> 0:2:42,92
THOMAS MORTON: How are women's
rights there--


41
0:2:42,92 --> 0:2:46,19
better or worse than they are
for Kurdish women in like


42
0:2:46,19 --> 0:2:48,65
Turkey, and Syria, and Iraq?


43
0:2:48,65 --> 0:2:50,13
Is Iran the worst?


44
0:2:50,13 --> 0:2:51,49
FEMALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


45
0:2:51,49 --> 0:3:51,29



46
0:3:51,29 --> 0:3:52,79
THOMAS MORTON: The leader of
the division took us on a


47
0:3:52,79 --> 0:3:55,33
short tour of the camp, where
the women were all boning up


48
0:3:55,33 --> 0:3:57,82
on their Apoism after lunch.


49
0:3:57,82 --> 0:3:59,71
If you took away the sniper
rifles, they'd, basically,


50
0:3:59,71 --> 0:4:4,32
look like college kids out
on a nice day doing their


51
0:4:4,32 --> 0:4:5,29
[INAUDIBLE] reading.


52
0:4:5,29 --> 0:4:7,64
We were still a little unsure if
this was really business as


53
0:4:7,64 --> 0:4:9,64
usual, or if we were
being given the old


54
0:4:9,64 --> 0:4:12,47
dog and pony show.


55
0:4:12,47 --> 0:4:14,59
The division had a pretty
permanent looking bunker dug


56
0:4:14,59 --> 0:4:17,17
into one of the hills, filled
with sleeping bags and posters


57
0:4:17,17 --> 0:4:19,91
of PJAK martyrs they were
keen on showing us.

59
0:4:21,16 --> 0:4:28,25



60
0:4:28,25 --> 0:4:30,605
THOMAS MORTON: Again, a little
suspicious on the whole, is


61
0:4:30,605 --> 0:4:31,98
this all just set up
for us, front.


62
0:4:31,98 --> 0:4:33,34
FEMALE SPEAKER:

63
0:4:33,34 --> 0:4:37,6



64
0:4:37,6 --> 0:4:39,0
THOMAS MORTON: Does everybody
have their portrait


65
0:4:39,0 --> 0:4:41,13
taken when they join?


66
0:4:41,13 --> 0:4:42,455
FEMALE SPEAKER:

67
0:4:42,455 --> 0:4:56,3



68
0:4:56,3 --> 0:4:57,83
MALE SPEAKER 1: Finally, study
time ended, and the division


69
0:4:57,83 --> 0:5:0,13
reassembled to run some drills
and show us what makes them


70
0:5:0,13 --> 0:5:2,56
the most fearsome female
warriors in the Middle East.

72
0:5:4,508 --> 0:5:16,683



73
0:5:16,683 --> 0:5:19,17
THOMAS MORTON: Probably a closer
resemblance to, like, a


74
0:5:19,17 --> 0:5:22,24
girl's summer camp than what I
would associate with usual


75
0:5:22,24 --> 0:5:23,705
military drilling.


76
0:5:23,705 --> 0:5:26,85
The Kalashnikovs are a little
different, but that could be


77
0:5:26,85 --> 0:5:28,1
replaced by archery.


78
0:5:28,1 --> 0:5:40,39



79
0:5:40,39 --> 0:5:43,276
I don't know if I hit
the rock or not.


80
0:5:43,276 --> 0:5:46,34
I feel like I'm getting all
the positive reinforcement


81
0:5:46,34 --> 0:5:47,26
with everybody else though.


82
0:5:47,26 --> 0:5:50,64
It's more about putting
in an effort.

85

THOMAS MORTON: Just basic army
stuff, just having lunch on


86
0:6:4,127 --> 0:6:7,76
the grass and then
line dancing.

88

89
0:6:11,76 --> 0:6:12,59
THOMAS MORTON: It's interesting,
I don't know,


90
0:6:12,59 --> 0:6:15,785
every time you think of women
soldiers, I think of like Lt.


91
0:6:15,785 --> 0:6:19,21
Vasquez in "Aliens," girls
butching themselves


92
0:6:19,21 --> 0:6:21,15
up to meet the boys.


93
0:6:21,15 --> 0:6:24,6
It's kind of refreshing to see
female soldiers who, on their


94
0:6:24,6 --> 0:6:27,435
own, hold on to a modest
amount of femininity.


95
0:6:27,435 --> 0:6:32,86



96
0:6:32,86 --> 0:6:35,39
Shortly after the circle dance,
somebody radioed our


97
0:6:35,39 --> 0:6:37,48
division leader that they'd
compromised their unit's


98
0:6:37,48 --> 0:6:40,37
security by firing their guns.


99
0:6:40,37 --> 0:6:43,52
And so, our time with the ladies
of PJAK came to an end,


100
0:6:43,52 --> 0:6:46,62
with us completely baffled how
these very nice, but not


101
0:6:46,62 --> 0:6:49,52
exactly professional, female
fighters could ever hold their


102
0:6:49,52 --> 0:6:53,38
own against the Iranian
Revolutionary Guard--


103
0:6:53,38 --> 0:6:55,51
that is, without a lot
of outside help.


104
0:6:55,51 --> 0:6:58,79
But as confusing as it was to
watch a supposed crack squad


105
0:6:58,79 --> 0:7:2,8
of PJAK guerrillas giggle and
clap their way through basic


106
0:7:2,8 --> 0:7:5,78
calisthenics and introductory
riflery, it actually sums up


107
0:7:5,78 --> 0:7:7,535
the whole Kurdish situation
pretty nicely.


108
0:7:7,535 --> 0:7:10,74



109
0:7:10,74 --> 0:7:12,98
There are sort of two competing
narratives with the


110
0:7:12,98 --> 0:7:14,43
Kurds in Iraq.


111
0:7:14,43 --> 0:7:17,52
In one, they're the classic
scrappy underdogs who, by dint


112
0:7:17,52 --> 0:7:20,41
of their skill and sheer
commitment to their cause,


113
0:7:20,41 --> 0:7:22,51
beat the greatest army in their
region and establish a


114
0:7:22,51 --> 0:7:24,65
beachhead for their
future nation.


115
0:7:24,65 --> 0:7:27,6
In the other, they are the
persecuted minority, who


116
0:7:27,6 --> 0:7:29,62
appeals to the West to save them
from genocide, and are


117
0:7:29,62 --> 0:7:31,85
now forever grateful for
America's intervention on


118
0:7:31,85 --> 0:7:33,1
their behalf.


119
0:7:33,1 --> 0:7:35,14



120
0:7:35,14 --> 0:7:37,43
The thing is, they're
sort of both true.


121
0:7:37,43 --> 0:7:39,55
And the Kurds are more than
happy to use whichever one


122
0:7:39,55 --> 0:7:42,92
suits their needs at any given
time, and whichever one suits


123
0:7:42,92 --> 0:7:45,72
the needs of their allies,
whoever those happen to be on


124
0:7:45,72 --> 0:7:48,39
that particular day.


125
0:7:48,39 --> 0:7:50,11
It's basically the old
schoolyard technique of


126
0:7:50,11 --> 0:7:52,24
pitting the bigger kids
against each other.


127
0:7:52,24 --> 0:7:55,21
I tell them, hey, Craig just
beat me up, and he says you're


128
0:7:55,21 --> 0:7:57,61
too much of a pussy to
do anything about it.


129
0:7:57,61 --> 0:7:59,64
But the Kurds have raised it
to the level of national


130
0:7:59,64 --> 0:8:2,71
political philosophy, which is,
honestly, a pretty great


131
0:8:2,71 --> 0:8:5,16
approach if you're a homeless
ethnic group sandwiched


132
0:8:5,16 --> 0:8:8,57
between Iran, Turkey,
Syria and Iraq--


133
0:8:8,57 --> 0:8:12,126
just provided the older
kids never catch on.
