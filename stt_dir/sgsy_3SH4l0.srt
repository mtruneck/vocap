0:0:4,52 --> 0:0:5,83
JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: Hello.


3
0:0:5,83 --> 0:0:9,4
We're going to see my friend
Mat Hoffman right now.


4
0:0:9,4 --> 0:0:13,75
And if you don't know
who he is, Mat is--


5
0:0:13,75 --> 0:0:17,52
he's like the Evel Knievel of
our time-- not "like," "is."


6
0:0:17,52 --> 0:0:23,84
And me, Jeff, and Spike just
did a documentary on him.


7
0:0:23,84 --> 0:0:25,84
Tremaine was actually
the director, me


8
0:0:25,84 --> 0:0:28,8
and Spike, mere producers.


9
0:0:28,8 --> 0:0:30,88
Anyway, the documentary is
called The Birth of Big Air.


10
0:0:30,88 --> 0:0:36,26
And we made the movie because
Mat is awesome.


11
0:0:36,26 --> 0:0:37,73
TONY HAWK: If you know anything
about BMX, you know


12
0:0:37,73 --> 0:0:40,4
who Mat Hoffman is.


13
0:0:40,4 --> 0:0:42,515
And maybe that's all you know.

0:0:42,515 --> 0:0:52,43
[PUNK MUSIC]


15
0:0:52,43 --> 0:0:55,43
SPIKE JONZE: There is this
point where it feels like


16
0:0:55,43 --> 0:0:56,8
everything's been done.


17
0:0:56,8 --> 0:0:58,94
And then somebody does something
else, and it opens


18
0:0:58,94 --> 0:1:0,67
up a whole new realm
of possibilities.


19
0:1:0,67 --> 0:1:4,17
And Mat's probably done
that a dozen times.


20
0:1:4,17 --> 0:1:6,3
MAT HOFFMAN: Is that really
possible, or am I just


21
0:1:6,3 --> 0:1:7,5
completely an idiot?


22
0:1:7,5 --> 0:1:9,71
MALE SPEAKER 1: Mat's holding
on one-handed down this


23
0:1:9,71 --> 0:1:12,46
rickety-ass plywood runway.


24
0:1:12,46 --> 0:1:14,1
MALE SPEAKER 2: You could crash
and kill yourself just


25
0:1:14,1 --> 0:1:16,26
on the run-up to the ramp.


26
0:1:16,26 --> 0:1:18,17
SPIKE JONZE: He's like that
big, and there's that


27
0:1:18,17 --> 0:1:19,19
much air under him.


28
0:1:19,19 --> 0:1:21,72
The ramp's that big.


29
0:1:21,72 --> 0:1:24,84
MAT HOFFMAN: And whether I
hold it, or skip to the


30
0:1:24,84 --> 0:1:29,27
ground, that moment
was everything.


31
0:1:29,27 --> 0:1:31,2
MALE SPEAKER 3: Three years
after Mat tore down his last


32
0:1:31,2 --> 0:1:34,13
big ramp, X Games added MegaRamp
and made it the


33
0:1:34,13 --> 0:1:36,9
centerpiece of the event.


34
0:1:36,9 --> 0:1:37,75
MALE SPEAKER 4: You watch the X
Games today, and you've got


35
0:1:37,75 --> 0:1:39,64
guys risking their lives
on these huge ramps.


36
0:1:39,64 --> 0:1:43,42
And Mat was definitely the guy
who started ratcheting it up


37
0:1:43,42 --> 0:1:44,67
to where it got to today.


38
0:1:44,67 --> 0:1:46,8



39
0:1:46,8 --> 0:1:48,4
TONY HAWK: He was the
first guy to do any


40
0:1:48,4 --> 0:1:48,68
sort of big ramp stuff.


41
0:1:48,68 --> 0:1:51,6
And now we've got the whole Big
Air event in the X Games.


42
0:1:51,6 --> 0:1:55,395
And that's largely because of
Mat ever trying it, or ever


43
0:1:55,395 --> 0:1:57,8
dreaming it.


44
0:1:57,8 --> 0:1:59,36
JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: Today's a
little nerve-wracking because


45
0:1:59,36 --> 0:2:3,57
a couple years ago, Mat almost
lost his right arm.


46
0:2:3,57 --> 0:2:5,7
He was in a big wreck.


47
0:2:5,7 --> 0:2:6,29
A semi hit him.


48
0:2:6,29 --> 0:2:10,66
So he hasn't ridden anything
big for two years, and the


49
0:2:10,66 --> 0:2:13,41
doctors told him he would
never ride again.


50
0:2:13,41 --> 0:2:19,84
And today he's riding
a very gnarly bowl.


51
0:2:19,84 --> 0:2:23,2
People say, oh, I love that
so much I'd give my


52
0:2:23,2 --> 0:2:24,53
right arm for it.


53
0:2:24,53 --> 0:2:26,39
Mat could do that today.


54
0:2:26,39 --> 0:2:32,48
I don't know, I'm just
a little nervous.


55
0:2:32,48 --> 0:2:34,85
MAT HOFFMAN: I have
no idea what I'm--


56
0:2:34,85 --> 0:2:37,34
this is like a new beginning,
this is like a first


57
0:2:37,34 --> 0:2:38,15
challenge, of like--


58
0:2:38,15 --> 0:2:40,67
I've never ridden a
ramp like this.


59
0:2:40,67 --> 0:2:42,25
I have whole new equipment.


60
0:2:42,25 --> 0:2:46,86
My arm has got totally
new limits.


61
0:2:46,86 --> 0:2:48,12
It's been a long kind
of ride that I've


62
0:2:48,12 --> 0:2:49,74
been doing with this--


63
0:2:49,74 --> 0:2:53,17



64
0:2:53,17 --> 0:2:54,1
Thanks, PJ, man.


65
0:2:54,1 --> 0:2:55,38
JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: Man, he's a
foul-mouthed little prick.


66
0:2:55,38 --> 0:2:57,35
He cussed me the whole
way up here for


67
0:2:57,35 --> 0:2:58,95
leaving him in the car.


68
0:2:58,95 --> 0:3:1,31
I said, Yoda, I am a Baptist,
and my ears


69
0:3:1,31 --> 0:3:3,816
aren't garbage cans.


70
0:3:3,816 --> 0:3:6,38
So I'll put him over here.


71
0:3:6,38 --> 0:3:8,48
MAT HOFFMAN: I really believed
that my arm wasn't going to


72
0:3:8,48 --> 0:3:11,53
work, and that I had totally
new limits, but they were


73
0:3:11,53 --> 0:3:14,19
limits that--


74
0:3:14,19 --> 0:3:17,26
pain tolerance-- couldn't really
ignore, because it just


75
0:3:17,26 --> 0:3:19,36
didn't work anymore.


76
0:3:19,36 --> 0:3:22,5
The power of a semi truck
hitting you at 50 miles an


77
0:3:22,5 --> 0:3:23,41
hour is just ridiculous.


78
0:3:23,41 --> 0:3:26,68
And so I've just lost these
muscles that control this arm.


79
0:3:26,68 --> 0:3:29,11
If you can kind of see my
collarbone, how that just


80
0:3:29,11 --> 0:3:30,98
moves around, it's not even
attached to anything.


81
0:3:30,98 --> 0:3:31,75
I've gone through here.


82
0:3:31,75 --> 0:3:32,75
I've gone through
this one twice.


83
0:3:32,75 --> 0:3:34,1
And I've gone through
this one.


84
0:3:34,1 --> 0:3:36,19
And I've been looking at my
bike-- how am I going to


85
0:3:36,19 --> 0:3:37,94
figure this out again, how
am I going to play?


86
0:3:37,94 --> 0:3:39,85
I started looking at my
body like, more as--


87
0:3:39,85 --> 0:3:42,56
JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: A bicycle
part, like Spike said.


88
0:3:42,56 --> 0:3:43,82
MAT HOFFMAN: And doctors
are like carpenters.


89
0:3:43,82 --> 0:3:47,42
After you get hurt enough, you
just start seeing your--


90
0:3:47,42 --> 0:3:49,23
you're just a piece of--


91
0:3:49,23 --> 0:3:51,74
your body's a part
of your bike.


92
0:3:51,74 --> 0:3:52,66
It's all one piece
of equipment.


93
0:3:52,66 --> 0:3:54,5
We're trying to keep going.


94
0:3:54,5 --> 0:3:55,43
JOHNNY KNOXVILLE: I don't
think most people


95
0:3:55,43 --> 0:3:57,83
look at it that way.


96
0:3:57,83 --> 0:3:59,79
MAT HOFFMAN: And really, what
people don't understand is I'm


97
0:3:59,79 --> 0:4:2,12
happy either way.


98
0:4:2,12 --> 0:4:4,411

bar, as happy as I am


99
0:4:4,411 --> 0:4:4,99

bunch of surgeries on you

25 something surgeries.

forearm, so you don't pull his

opportunity to do this with

up with this spirit and this
fire, like, being able to tell

a whole new level.

give me some props on this.

untalented, but then still go

that anybody should have.
