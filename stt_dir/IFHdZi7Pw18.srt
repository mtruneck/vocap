0:1:28,4 --> 0:1:30,68
I'm 83 years old.


38
0:1:30,68 --> 0:1:36,1
And I think since 1960 I've
seen 13 Olympic Games.


39
0:1:36,1 --> 0:1:39,8
My first Games was in 1960,
and what gave me the great


40
0:1:39,8 --> 0:1:44,46
passion to go again was the end
of the Olympic Games, at


41
0:1:44,46 --> 0:1:47,71
the closing ceremony in Rome.


42
0:1:47,71 --> 0:1:52,45
There was a big sign and a big
announcement that said


43
0:1:52,45 --> 0:1:58,57
arrivederci, and we would
meet again in Tokyo


44
0:1:58,57 --> 0:2:0,41
in four years time.


45
0:2:0,41 --> 0:2:3,75
And that brought tears to
my eyes, and I said


46
0:2:3,75 --> 0:2:7,58
yes, I shall be there.


47
0:2:7,58 --> 0:2:9,93
The games came first always.


48
0:2:9,93 --> 0:2:12,11
I wanted to see the one
more and the one


49
0:2:12,11 --> 0:2:14,19
more and the one more.

Eight years ago, we knew
that the games were

0:2:24,83 --> 0:2:26,97
going to be in London.


54
0:2:26,97 --> 0:2:30,77
And I thought well, in eight
years' time, I could well be


55
0:2:30,77 --> 0:2:32,475
in a wheelchair.


56
0:2:32,475 --> 0:2:36,94

disappointment.

I'm never down hearted, it

off the enthusiasm.

now not really more than a


63

couple of hundred yards from
the main Olympic site.

0:2:59,82 --> 0:3:2,19
And yet you're already dropping
into another world.


65
0:3:2,19 --> 0:3:7,53
A strange mix of decaying
industrial grunge with


66
0:3:7,53 --> 0:3:10,19
elements of the country, with
the wilderness-- the real


67
0:3:10,19 --> 0:3:12,105
wilderness that was untouched.


68
0:3:12,105 --> 0:3:17,4



69
0:3:17,4 --> 0:3:20,61
This was a zone that was
dangerously dirty.


70
0:3:20,61 --> 0:3:24,18
It was where there were
two landfill dumps.


71
0:3:24,18 --> 0:3:27,81
There was a factory making
luminous watch dials.


72
0:3:27,81 --> 0:3:30,72
There was a small nuclear
reactor that belonged to Queen


73
0:3:30,72 --> 0:3:31,99
Mary College.


74
0:3:31,99 --> 0:3:35,99
The tarmac that we're standing
on now is actually being


75
0:3:35,99 --> 0:3:38,32
re-branded as the Olympic
Greenway.


76
0:3:38,32 --> 0:3:40,65
And in reality what
it is is Joseph


77
0:3:40,65 --> 0:3:42,18
Bazalgette's sewage outfall.


78
0:3:42,18 --> 0:3:44,64
So it was a thing that
was functional.


79
0:3:44,64 --> 0:3:48,33
It was carrying the sewage out
of London and therefore


80
0:3:48,33 --> 0:3:51,99
helping to alleviate cholera and
all the diseases that were


81
0:3:51,99 --> 0:3:55,1
making London intolerable with
stinks and smells, and


82
0:3:55,1 --> 0:3:57,39
creating something viable
and useful.


83
0:3:57,39 --> 0:4:1,66
And that is being cosmetically
doctored with tarmac that's


84
0:4:1,66 --> 0:4:4,23
turned it into an airport
runway, or a motorway.


85
0:4:4,23 --> 0:4:8,78
And so in a sense you have the
entire panorama of cultural


86
0:4:8,78 --> 0:4:13,57

MIKE WELLS: One of the things we
discovered at Games Monitor


90
0:4:21,279 --> 0:4:27,28
was that radioactive waste had
been buried in the cesspit of


91
0:4:27,28 --> 0:4:30,93
a house that had previously
stood on our site.


92
0:4:30,93 --> 0:4:32,49
We were living on the estate.

These clowns, the Olympic
Delivery Authority-- the ODA--


94
0:4:35,7 --> 0:4:39,51
came on to the landfill site and
started excavating, taking


95
0:4:39,51 --> 0:4:42,4
no precautions for
the existence


96
0:4:42,4 --> 0:4:43,39
of radioactive waste.


97
0:4:43,39 --> 0:4:46,98
They were excavating for months
before finally, we


98
0:4:46,98 --> 0:4:50,21
don't know why, they called in
radiation protection advisers.


99
0:4:50,21 --> 0:4:52,3
The first day they were
on site, they


100
0:4:52,3 --> 0:4:53,37
started finding stuff.


101
0:4:53,37 --> 0:4:57,4
They had to trace back where
it had been excavated from,


102
0:4:57,4 --> 0:4:58,53
and they actually traced
it back to the


103
0:4:58,53 --> 0:5:0,0

is so hot that you're gonna

something like that, but there


106

IAIN SINCLAIR: The interesting
thing about the Lower Lea


108

was a borderline.

lived in the density of East

trouble making I've been


160
0:7:34,585 --> 0:7:37,65
involved in with regards to
the Olympic Games has been


161
0:7:37,65 --> 0:7:41,17
getting the truth out, and has
been trying to bust the myths


162
0:7:41,17 --> 0:7:44,4
that LOCOG-- the London
Organizing Committee of the


163
0:7:44,4 --> 0:7:47,47

166

One of the biggest myths that
LOCOG has been trying to sell


167
0:7:54,13 --> 0:7:57,4
about the Olympic games is
that it's going to bring


168
0:7:57,4 --> 0:8:0,41
regeneration to London and
to the rest of Britain.


169
0:8:0,41 --> 0:8:4,69
Regeneration is when preexisting
community remains


170
0:8:4,69 --> 0:8:5,71
in an area.


171
0:8:5,71 --> 0:8:9,25
And you bring in more schools,
you bring better hospitals,


172
0:8:9,25 --> 0:8:10,8
you bring in better
public services.


173
0:8:10,8 --> 0:8:13,32
And you generally make
life smiley.


174
0:8:13,32 --> 0:8:14,24
It's not--


175
0:8:14,24 --> 0:8:16,64
as what's happening in the
London borough of Newham, and


176
0:8:16,64 --> 0:8:18,92
lots of parts of Hackney and
parts of East London which are


177
0:8:18,92 --> 0:8:19,68
most affected--


178
0:8:19,68 --> 0:8:22,75
directly affected by the games,
where people are being


179
0:8:22,75 --> 0:8:26,4
taken from their neighborhood
and then being told to leave


180
0:8:26,4 --> 0:8:28,94
that community, so that
you can then build new


181
0:8:28,94 --> 0:8:32,659
condominiums, built a smacking
new shopping center and bring


182
0:8:32,659 --> 0:8:34,83

economic class to


183
0:8:34,83 --> 0:8:35,89
up the area a bit.


184

But what happens to all
those families?


185
0:8:37,83 --> 0:8:40,919
They get sent as far as places
like Stoke, or they get sent


186
0:8:40,919 --> 0:8:42,44
to Essex, or they get
sent elsewhere.


187

188
0:8:43,1 --> 0:8:44,47

0:9:25,36 --> 0:9:28,8
and visit, seeing as it's
right on your doorstep.


204
0:9:28,8 --> 0:9:30,82
Absolutely nothing,
no mention of us.


205
0:9:30,82 --> 0:9:33,12
It's almost like we
just don't exist.


206
0:9:33,12 --> 0:9:35,32
And it's sad, really, because
it's right on your doorstep,


207
0:9:35,32 --> 0:9:38,47
and you should be able to enjoy
it and be part of it,


208
0:9:38,47 --> 0:9:40,37
but we're not.


209
0:9:40,37 --> 0:9:41,29
JOE ALEXANDER: We're up
in Denison Point--


210
0:9:41,29 --> 0:9:44,11
I think it's floor 17 or 18--


211
0:9:44,11 --> 0:9:49,94
and the council have
leased the top five


212
0:9:49,94 --> 0:9:52,84
floors to the BBC.


213
0:9:52,84 --> 0:9:56,21
Initially they said that the
blocks had asbestos in, so


214
0:9:56,21 --> 0:9:57,36
they're not fit for purpose.


215
0:9:57,36 --> 0:9:58,23
It's not safe.


216
0:9:58,23 --> 0:10:1,5
But it's safe enough to
build media suites.


217
0:10:1,5 --> 0:10:4,37
Community's been dispersed,
you know?


218
0:10:4,37 --> 0:10:5,55
And this is why they did it.


219
0:10:5,55 --> 0:10:10,52
They wanted the BBC, wanted to
have these lovely views and


220
0:10:10,52 --> 0:10:11,84
sing praise to the Olympics.


221
0:10:11,84 --> 0:10:14,46
Which is probably not a bad
thing except when you have to


222
0:10:14,46 --> 0:10:17,49
factor in that just down here
you see all these houses and


223
0:10:17,49 --> 0:10:20,82
all these people are going to be
kicked out of their homes.


224
0:10:20,82 --> 0:10:26,6
And many of them have lived
there for 40 plus years.


225
0:10:26,6 --> 0:10:29,14
This community's nearly
half a century old.


226
0:10:29,14 --> 0:10:31,5
Lately gentrification--


227
0:10:31,5 --> 0:10:33,53
especially when it comes
to regeneration--


228
0:10:33,53 --> 0:10:36,22
is about wholesale land grab.


229
0:10:36,22 --> 0:10:41,77
About moving communities away
from where their homes and


230
0:10:41,77 --> 0:10:44,19
where they're used to, and
effectively just dismantling.


231
0:10:44,19 --> 0:10:45,44
It's like social cleansing.


232
0:10:45,44 --> 0:10:49,21



233
0:10:49,21 --> 0:10:52,77
I think what the Olympics does
is it speeds the process up.


234
0:10:52,77 --> 0:10:55,7
I think it was already
happening, but the Olympics


235
0:10:55,7 --> 0:10:57,13
has given it an extra boost.


236
0:10:57,13 --> 0:11:0,1
And it's helped it to kind of
like a move lot quicker.


237
0:11:0,1 --> 0:11:1,54
DOLORES JOHN-PHILLIP: Because
it's like now, oh, because of


238
0:11:1,54 --> 0:11:3,85
the Olympics we're regenerating,
you know, we're


239
0:11:3,85 --> 0:11:5,54
doing up East London.


240
0:11:5,54 --> 0:11:9,7
Always been a very poor borough,
and so forth, and


241
0:11:9,7 --> 0:11:13,49
they're throwing money into it
as if to say, oh look what


242
0:11:13,49 --> 0:11:13,98
we're doing for you.


243
0:11:13,98 --> 0:11:17,35
No, they're not doing it for
us, the people like me.


244
0:11:17,35 --> 0:11:20,565
It's not for us, because they
don't want us here.


245
0:11:20,565 --> 0:13:20,565
