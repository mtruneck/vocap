###11 MALE SPEAKER: And your hand shakes from Parkinson's?
###13 THOM DEVITA: Yes, and you noticed my hand shaking?
###15 MALE SPEAKER: And how long ago did Parkinson's set in?
###19 THOM DEVITA: About a year and a half ago.
###22 I was born with a central tremor.
###25 A central tremor shakes when you pick something up.
###30 Parkinson's stops when you pick something up.
###33 When the Parkinson's stops, the central tremor immediately
###36 takes over.
###39 MALE SPEAKER: That got you all in.
###41 THOM DEVITA: There's also another one.
###44 You ever see somebody so scared they shake?
###47 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###50 THOM DEVITA: I asked this today of the neurologist, if
###55 being scared could make your hands shake, if that was part
###60 of a central tremor.
###61 He says no, no, no, but that's another kind of tremor and he
###67 had a name for it.
###70 I forgot the name, but I think I got that also.
###74 MALE SPEAKER: You have all the tremors?
###75 THOM DEVITA: All the three tremors.
###77 MALE SPEAKER: What are you scared of, you think?
###79 THOM DEVITA: It's mental.
###80 You don't know, the mind works without even you knowing it.
###85 
###107 JOHN WYATT: Well, somebody else told me that Thom
###110 actually moved to Newburgh, New York.
###112 I know that he moved there, because his wife took an
###115 engineering job for IBM.
###119 When I got up there, he greeted me on the porch.
###121 And I said to him, Thom, I'm shocked that you
###124 moved out of New York.
###125 You never were comfortable being outside of it.
###128 And he said, but think about this.
###130 I always lived a couple blocks from the Hudson River.
###133 When I was a kid in Harlem, we lived near the Hudson River,
###137 when I was on the Lower East Side, I wasn't far from it.
###140 And then he pointed, and he said there it
###142 is, two blocks away.
###144 
###152 MALE SPEAKER: How long have you lived over here?
###156 NICK BUBASH: Remember when we moved out of your apartment on
###158 Fourth Street?
###159 There was that one closet we'd never open, and you
###163 said don't open it.
###165 You remember that?
###166 There was so much stuff.
###167 Remember we had to hold the stuff, I think [INAUDIBLE]
###170 held the stuff.
###171 And then we slammed the doors of the truck real fast so it
###174 wouldn't all fall out.
###175 There was so much stuff.
###176 We took the doors off the hinges, everything, because he
###179 had made art out of everything.
###181 And I drove the truck and Jenny went the wrong way.
###186 Oh boy, it was crazy getting up here, but we did it.
###189 SCOTT HARRISON: I mean, I'm sure he probably would have
###190 preferred to stay in Manhattan his whole life, but that
###193 didn't work out.
###194 NICK BUBASH: Yeah, we took a train out.
###196 You remember when Cliff Raven came?
###198 SCOTT HARRISON: But he said if you're not in Manhattan, you
###202 might as well be anywhere.
###204 And Newburgh was anywhere.
###205 
###211 ROBERT RYAN: It's definitely a pilgrimage.
###213 I always feel great after I go.
###216 Well, first you make an arrangement to go see him.
###220 THOM DEVITA: Visits by referral only.
###222 ROBERT RYAN: Once the dog mellows out and then you can
###224 walk a little bit more freely around.
###226 And he'll start to show you all this amazing art that he's
###230 been making since he's moved up there, and probably even
###233 before he was up there.
###234 
###241 His work area and his living area are the same thing.
###245 He lives within what he's creating every day.
###250 Going into Thom's home studio was like the
###253 next level for me.
###254 I had seen his tattoos, I had seen some of the art that he
###258 had been making.
###259 But to see it in his place is like, now you're seeing the
###263 true living art, it's everywhere.
###267 It's like going to a museum.
###270 By the end, I'm not sure what I'd even seen.
###273 I'm just overwhelmed, there's so much of it and it's such a
###277 strong, powerful volume that it's kind of disorienting
###281 after a while.
###283 THOM DEVITA: You want to see a Sailor Jerry?
###285 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###286 
###291 Is that an original?
###292 THOM DEVITA: Yes.
###293 MALE SPEAKER: And you put this Gotham Tattoo stamp on it?
###295 THOM DEVITA: Yes, it belongs to me.
###298 I can do anything I want with it.
###301 That's the way I feel about art, if it belongs to you, you
###304 can do anything you want with it.
###306 Unless you made a deal with the artist that you
###308 couldn't touch it.
###310 I collect all kind of things.
###312 MALE SPEAKER: I've noticed.
###313 THOM DEVITA: I think they're nice, they're good-looking.
###317 NICK BUBASH: Thom and I were always hunting for objects.
###319 We'd go trashing, go into stores, and antique stores or
###323 junk shops.
###324 And we were always looking for objects, constantly.
###327 That was one of his big things, he got a lot of
###329 inspiration out of anything.
###333 My relationship with Thom deVita, well, at this point I
###337 suppose you could say good friend.
###338 But he was my mentor, my teacher.
###341 I first met him, I think, about 1971.
###344 MALE SPEAKER: Did you teach Nick how to tattoo?
###347 THOM DEVITA: You never tattooed before you met me.
###350 NICK BUBASH: No.
###350 THOM DEVITA: He's the only guy who ever tattooed in my shop.
###355 NICK BUBASH: I tattooed in his shop on Fourth Street.
###359 I can't remember how I found him.
###361 I think I just found him, and there he was, he was sitting
###364 on the stoop.
###365 I walked up to him and said I was interested
###367 in getting a tattoo.
###368 I followed him into his studio, and
###371 that's how I met him.
###372 I looked for him and I found him.
###375 I got these in 1973 or something like that.
###378 There's a big fish.
###379 Here, I'll take my shirt off if you promise not to take a
###383 picture of my body.
###384 I'm getting old and fat.
###385 THOM DEVITA: I'm getting old and skinny.
###388 I am old and skinny.
###390 NICK BUBASH: This is a early Japanese fish.
###393 MALE SPEAKER: It looks a lot like your style of tattooing.
###397 NICK BUBASH: It's where it all began, man.
###401 ROBERT RYAN: Definitely two guys that have spent a lot of
###404 time together and have been through a lot together.
###407 And I think they're probably best friends, as far as best
###411 friends can be.
###413 NICK BUBASH: Good bye.
###414 
###417 I love you, you old [INAUDIBLE].
###420 THOM DEVITA: I'm not a hugger.
###422 NICK BUBASH: He won't hug you.
###425 ROBERT RYAN: And Nick has so much respect for Thom.
###427 I think he feels like Thom helped him in a great way.
###431 NICK BUBASH: When I met him, he was probably 40.
###434 I was 19.
###437 I was trying to make art, and I was doing everything you
###439 have to do to stay alive in New York.
###440 I was driving a cab, I was doing landscaping, I was doing
###443 whatever I needed to do.
###445 I was basically just a working stiff with an idea that I
###451 wanted to be an artist.
###453 I found Thom.
###455 I saw what he was doing.
###456 I really got turned on by the fact that he
###460 was actually an artist.
###462 I thought well, I'm going to do some big drawings and take
###465 them down here and show them to him.
###466 So I did some big dragon drawings.
###467 And when he saw the drawings, I can remember clearly, he
###471 said to me, you can come back here anytime you want to come.
###476 And I said OK, man, and I was there all the time.
###479 deVita's influence was enormous on me.
###482 Thom taught me the mental part of it-- the attitude, the
###487 lifestyle, and how you create your own reality.
###491 He was my greatest influence.
###493 ROBERT RYAN: The deVita influence on Nick's work is
###497 very, very strong.
###499 NICK BUBASH: "The Porcupine of God," it's painted over an old
###502 lithograph.
###503 ROBERT RYAN: And Nick comes from definitely a more
###506 schooled art background.
###509 He does fine art sculpture, and he does also great
###513 paintings and drawings and he does these amazing
###516 assemblages.
###517 You can definitely see Thom's influences there, and it's
###520 really present in his work.
###522 NICK BUBASH: Thom did a lot of assemblages.
###524 I think that's probably where I got the inclination to
###529 assemble things into works of art, because he that a lot.
###533 
###536 This is the thinking table.
###540 Believe it or not, there's order to this.
###543 And my philosophy is that I bring order to
###547 the chaos that surrounds.
###549 The chaos forces the order.
###553 This one I imagine is like a prehistoric animal with the
###556 largest set of horns ever seen or ever discovered.
###562 These things evolve.
###562 And sometimes I'll get obsessed with one object and
###565 I'll start working on it.
###566 But at times I'll be passing by and I'll move something on
###570 it or change something.
###571 That's kind of how this table works.
###575 But as you can see, I have a million things down here and
###577 I'm adding to them.
###580 Hopefully I'll get up to two or three million before I die.
###583 
###586 Thom's never been to this studio.
###589 I think it's kind of getting hard for him to move around.
###593 He's getting tired and old.
###595 Who knows, he may live to be 100--
###597 I hope he does.
###598 I hope he lives to be 200.
###599 I hope he outlives me because I don't want
###603 to see him go ever.
###604 
###612 So here's the list of things you have to do, right?
###616 These are the books you have to sign and number.
###618 
###621 Number two, I think all you have to do is--
###623 THOM DEVITA: I won't remember all of that.
###624 NICK BUBASH: Well look, books to sign and number.
###627 Two, 17, 18, 19, 20.
###629 THOM DEVITA: Here's what I wanted you to do, is to do one
###633 of these for yourself.
###634 This was you can tell me [INAUDIBLE].
###636 NICK BUBASH: OK, give me a piece of paper.
###637 
###641 If you have any questions, you know what to
###643 do with those books.
###644 I'm going to call you every goddamn day until--
###645 THOM DEVITA: After you sell them all.
###649 ED HARDY: Oh, he drives Nick crazy.
###651 I mean, Nick will tell you.
###652 He'll call me up and go Jesus Christ.
###654 And we're trying to help Thom out a lot, but
###659 he's just who he is.
###660 THOM DEVITA: What were we going to do?
###662 NICK BUBASH: We're going to work on my piece here.
###666 THOM DEVITA: Oh, we're going to do it on the original?
###668 NICK BUBASH: No, on this one.
###669 Yeah, on the original, not on the book.
###671 THOM DEVITA: OK, I'm confused.
###673 NICK BUBASH: We collaborated on a bunch of stuff.
###675 He would send me stuff and then I'd re-do it, and then
###678 he'd re-do it.
###679 And finally he told me [INAUDIBLE]
###681 I didn't know what I was doing and he quit.
###683 
###686 He didn't like what I was doing.
###689 Were you going to make the whole goddamn thing red?
###691 THOM DEVITA: No, Sherlock.
###693 
###697 If you don't like it, you can erase it.
###698 NICK BUBASH: If I don't like it, I can erase it.
###702 He was never mean or harmful.
###704 He would criticize you, there's no
###707 two ways about that.
###708 He would say well, do you like this?
###711 And I'd say no, I don't like it.
###712 And he'd say well, you just aren't advanced
###714 enough to like it.
###716 THOM DEVITA: Nick, did you see the poster for the
###718 show we were in?
###719 This is one that I made up.
###721 NICK BUBASH: Mine and Ed's don't have the copper border
###725 that he put on there.
###726 But when I go home I'm going to put a copper border on mine
###729 same that Thom did.
###730 THOM DEVITA: You don't know what brush I used.
###732 NICK BUBASH: Well, I mean, how's anybody going to know?
###736 THOM DEVITA: If I hadn't told you it was copper, he would
###740 have done it in gold.
###741 NICK BUBASH: No.
###742 You know what, you can use that.
###745 I know what to use.
###746 THOM DEVITA: Well, you would have done it in gold.
###748 NICK BUBASH: No, I would have done it in copper.
###750 I've learned to use copper.
###752 JOHN WYATT: It could be argumentative, but I think a
###754 lot of that was he liked to play a lot of semantics.
###758 ROBERT RYAN: That's me getting tattooed.
###761 I'm not sure who took this photo.
###762 So you remember?
###763 THOM DEVITA: I claim all them things to be mine beyond
###766 [INAUDIBLE].
###768 ROBERT RYAN: But you couldn't do the tattoo and take the
###770 photo at the same time, so someone had to take it.
###774 THOM DEVITA: That's not important.
###776 MALE SPEAKER: Do you ever get nervous that you're going to
###778 misspeak around him?
###779 ROBERT RYAN: Always.
###781 But he'll tell me that I misspoke.
###785 THOM DEVITA: It's true, but it's a little mixed up.
###788 No, that's not what I'm saying.
###790 I said yes, yeah, no.
###793 ROBERT RYAN: Ed still has the stencil for your dragon on the
###796 center of your chest.
###799 THOM DEVITA: No, he doesn't.
###800 ROBERT RYAN: No?
###801 THOM DEVITA: I got the stencil.
###803 ROBERT RYAN: Oh yeah?
###804 THOM DEVITA: I was thinking about it the other day, but I
###806 haven't seen it for a while.
###807 ROBERT RYAN: Do you think maybe he took it?
###810 THOM DEVITA: No.
###813 Unless I cut another stencil and I gave him that one.
###817 CLAYTON PATTERSON: Thom is an au
###818 contraire kind of character.
###819 His whole thing is kind of arguing
###821 and setting up debates.
###823 And it's a certain kind of Italian, a little Sicilian
###826 kind of thing.
###827 Throwing a lot of salt in there and the fire and getting
###830 the sparks going.
###831 NICK BUBASH: [INAUDIBLE] machines and you could tattoo
###833 with them, but it was tough.
###835 It was tough to get the coloring with them.
###838 THOM DEVITA: No, you could tattoo with a Spaulding
###842 machine if you know how to tattoo.
###844 NICK BUBASH: Right, that's true.
###846 THOM DEVITA: If you don't know how to tattoo, you got to go
###848 to somebody else maybe.
###849 NICK BUBASH: Do you understand my point?
###851 Like, with a better tool you can--
###852 THOM DEVITA: No.
###852 ED HARDY: I don't know if I've ever seen Thom visibly excited
###855 in my life, except if he gets mad about something.
###858 He's really stubborn.
###859 He's really opinionated.
###860 I mean, you can get into an argument with him about what
###862 the correct term is if you're locking the card door.
###866 I mean, you just get into stuff all the time.
###869 THOM DEVITA: What's this guy you mentioned the other day?
###871 NICK BUBASH: R. Crumb.
###873 THOM DEVITA: Yeah, I dislike him.
###874 NICK BUBASH: You don't like R. Crumb?
###876 THOM DEVITA: No, I don't like cartoons.
###879 You understand that?
###880 NICK BUBASH: But you've got nothing against R. Crumb?
###882 THOM DEVITA: I don't know him, so I don't know
###883 anything about him.
###884 I don't like his work.
###885 NICK BUBASH: You don't like his work?
###888 THOM DEVITA: I don't like cartoons.
###889 NICK BUBASH: OK, all right.
###891 You don't like cartoons.
###893 I get the point.
###897 You didn't even like Al Capp?
###898 THOM DEVITA: Not even Al Capp.
###902 MALE SPEAKER: Do a lot of kids skateboard past your--
###904 THOM DEVITA: No, not that many.
###906 NICK BUBASH: Thom puts rocks out there so they can't do it.
###911 THOM DEVITA: No, I don't mind kids.
###913 It looks all right for kids.
###915 But for grownups to be on a skateboard, it looks stupid.
###919 NICK BUBASH: Yeah.
###920
