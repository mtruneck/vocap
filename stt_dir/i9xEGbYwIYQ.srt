0:0:0,17 --> 0:0:4,85
i love this story about boxes did you
and your story about perhaps the


2
0:0:4,85 --> 0:0:8,869
preserve cost ten dollars and this
controversy right


3
0:0:8,869 --> 0:0:12,28
but it's perfect because his fox is one
oh working


4
0:0:12,28 --> 0:0:15,399
so what's fluxes one-on-one when it
comes to race issues


5
0:0:15,399 --> 0:0:19,15
what is the four elicit you must have


6
0:0:19,15 --> 0:0:21,63
what you need to blame black people


7
0:0:21,63 --> 0:0:23,8
using its there


8
0:0:23,8 --> 0:0:24,34
the particular sir


9
0:0:24,34 --> 0:0:27,669
number two immediate axle rights groups


10
0:0:27,669 --> 0:0:28,56
number three


11
0:0:28,56 --> 0:0:30,779
you need to protect corporations would


12
0:0:30,779 --> 0:0:32,25
and a number four


13
0:0:32,25 --> 0:0:36,94
you must use a black man as a proxy for
these effects of course i was like i


14
0:0:36,94 --> 0:0:37,3
said


15
0:0:37,3 --> 0:0:40,25
isn't mentioned three hundred dollars
sneakers on like this is going to be


16
0:0:40,25 --> 0:0:41,41
some sort of like


17
0:0:41,41 --> 0:0:45,27
picked up on the black community are
already any abuse of like it


18
0:0:45,27 --> 0:0:46,73
so in this clip


19
0:0:46,73 --> 0:0:50,37
big building they wait four four four


20
0:0:50,37 --> 0:0:52,94
sold three hundred fifty dollars seekers


21
0:0:52,94 --> 0:0:55,8
our civil rights issue


22
0:0:55,8 --> 0:0:58,749
ice pack share the sticker shock i think
we ought to three hundred dollars


23
0:0:58,749 --> 0:1:0,93
prepare sneakers so when you look at


24
0:1:0,93 --> 0:1:4,28
some of the real problems facing black
america


25
0:1:4,28 --> 0:1:7,3
fourteen point four percent unemployment
six


26
0:1:7,3 --> 0:1:8,38
points higher


27
0:1:8,38 --> 0:1:11,47
than the national average kids are
heading back to school black kids


28
0:1:11,47 --> 0:1:15,22
disproportionately will head back to the
worst schools the most violent schools


29
0:1:15,22 --> 0:1:16,35
with the worse


30
0:1:16,35 --> 0:1:18,23
performing teachers


31
0:1:18,23 --> 0:1:19,9
and this is what


32
0:1:19,9 --> 0:1:24,34
uh... national urban league wants to
talk about the price of sneakers doesn't


33
0:1:24,34 --> 0:1:27,74
make a lot of sense yet as in the
national normally is saying hey you know


34
0:1:27,74 --> 0:1:28,39
what


35
0:1:28,39 --> 0:1:31,1
since you wanted to our kids


36
0:1:31,1 --> 0:1:34,7
and that you tried in these incredible
amounts of money it doesn't help their


37
0:1:34,7 --> 0:1:37,35
poverty doesn't help the situation is
set up


38
0:1:37,35 --> 0:1:38,77
that's what it concerned about it


39
0:1:38,77 --> 0:1:41,8
now you can argue about that whether
that is a legitimate


40
0:1:41,8 --> 0:1:43,81
safety concern itself with its own


41
0:1:43,81 --> 0:1:48,679
but here fox was a major it's not the
corporations law it's not their fault


42
0:1:48,679 --> 0:1:51,4
for overcharging et cetera okay


43
0:1:51,4 --> 0:1:54,43
whose fault is it is the black people's
fault of the terrible schools is that


44
0:1:54,43 --> 0:1:55,51
are set up


45
0:1:55,51 --> 0:1:59,649
idled as the wall street journal
columnist wall street journal also owned


46
0:1:59,649 --> 0:2:2,5
by rupert murdoch who owns this court


47
0:2:2,5 --> 0:2:4,78
jason miley tells me something he's
black


48
0:2:4,78 --> 0:2:6,88
here let's let 'em uh... explain


49
0:2:6,88 --> 0:2:10,14
to use worked out the president of the
national program we says


50
0:2:10,14 --> 0:2:14,63
quote it's insensitive to market of
three hundred dollars shoot to kids and


51
0:2:14,63 --> 0:2:18,889
teens as people are going back to school
and struggling to buy school supplies


52
0:2:18,889 --> 0:2:24,54
this fee is not produce is not read it's
a single pair of sneakers sorry same


53
0:2:24,54 --> 0:2:26,63
it's insensitive sent out their work


54
0:2:26,63 --> 0:2:28,669
they're worried about the feelings


55
0:2:28,669 --> 0:2:30,79
to the extent that this is an issue


56
0:2:30,79 --> 0:2:34,619
establishing record at the black
community this is about bally's


57
0:2:34,619 --> 0:2:37,96
services about culture puts blaine that
puts


58
0:2:37,96 --> 0:2:40,129
conspicuous consumption hadith


59
0:2:40,129 --> 0:2:44,819
industry and threat and the focus needs
to be on the black community to to


60
0:2:44,819 --> 0:2:46,139
rectify that


61
0:2:46,139 --> 0:2:49,73
blaming corporate america is not gonna
fix that problem


62
0:2:49,73 --> 0:2:53,709
that clinton is one way or another you
need to understand the right people to


63
0:2:53,709 --> 0:2:56,269
blame or black people


64
0:2:56,269 --> 0:3:0,11
humpback partridge what you'd have a
legitimate conversation about


65
0:3:0,11 --> 0:3:1,559
they say you know what


66
0:3:1,559 --> 0:3:5,399
list you know as bill cosby tries to do
from time to have any dislike each and i


67
0:3:5,399 --> 0:3:6,83
have history of this error


68
0:3:6,83 --> 0:3:8,469
but try to help


69
0:3:8,469 --> 0:3:11,66
this is not helping people destroy a
national television is saying


70
0:3:11,66 --> 0:3:15,21
it's black people's fault and don't
worry we got a black eye this a but


71
0:3:15,21 --> 0:3:16,159
they're not


72
0:3:16,159 --> 0:3:18,519
done yet


73
0:3:18,519 --> 0:3:21,58
so if it's shifting the blame alan on
this uh...


74
0:3:21,58 --> 0:3:24,37
the cultures and and the sensibilities
of the black community


75
0:3:24,37 --> 0:3:28,9
but he uh... you name the topic you know
obvious she'd make happen schools is not


76
0:3:28,9 --> 0:3:32,56
because you know black kids watch twice
as much television is like it's it's


77
0:3:32,56 --> 0:3:36,71
because standardized tests are biased
great you know uh... tub of black men


78
0:3:36,71 --> 0:3:38,96
are ever filling our prisons


79
0:3:38,96 --> 0:3:40,749
are not because of lack the head here


80
0:3:40,749 --> 0:3:43,79
but because the criminal justice system
is racist


81
0:3:43,79 --> 0:3:44,29
this is all about


82
0:3:44,29 --> 0:3:47,87
shifting blame when it comes to civil
rights leaders and they're not doing


83
0:3:47,87 --> 0:3:51,339
any favors for the people they claim to
represent


84
0:3:51,339 --> 0:3:53,139
perfect point number five


85
0:3:53,139 --> 0:3:56,38
as there is no duty assignment shifting
blaine


86
0:3:56,38 --> 0:4:1,45
usse well you see that civil rights
leaders to black people are sitting way


87
0:4:1,45 --> 0:4:6,26
it's that needs to be and their their in
the ear amazingly talented during this


88
0:4:6,26 --> 0:4:8,479
they do it over and over again and what
with it


89
0:4:8,479 --> 0:4:11,889
it's not like they're trying to help the
black community it's not like boxes as


90
0:4:11,889 --> 0:4:12,98
this huge


91
0:4:12,98 --> 0:4:16,379
lack of your eagerness you're like a
guys hit list let's have an honest


92
0:4:16,379 --> 0:4:18,759
conversation about what's happening
right


93
0:4:18,759 --> 0:4:21,439
no this is the right that there was no
audience


94
0:4:21,439 --> 0:4:25,839
so they got all you have towards those
black kids wasting their money in the


95
0:4:25,839 --> 0:4:28,36
three hundred dollars sneakers


96
0:4:28,36 --> 0:4:30,6
that we found a nice one


97
0:4:30,6 --> 0:4:32,86
and he says it's all their fault the
crime as their fault the schools are


98
0:4:32,86 --> 0:4:36,89
their fault it's all their culture
that's the problem


99
0:4:36,89 --> 0:4:39,129
fall where they would be made out white
culture but i guess of mom's going to


100
0:4:39,129 --> 0:4:42,479
take your money give them out of three
hundred dollars speakers and of course


101
0:4:42,479 --> 0:4:46,549
this is the type of programming that
gives you know individuals in this


102
0:4:46,549 --> 0:4:51,18
country and molly to speak out against
social programs because they'll say


103
0:4:51,18 --> 0:4:54,79
all working on these minorities taking
advantage of social programs like


104
0:4:54,79 --> 0:4:56,46
welfare and food stamps


105
0:4:56,46 --> 0:4:59,8
when at the same time combined the three
hundred dollars sneakers that's what


106
0:4:59,8 --> 0:5:3,699
this is really about at live in the
edison that nobody resist seed in


107
0:5:3,699 --> 0:5:8,669
back-to-back segments and holders how do
you want to thank you and i don't know


108
0:5:8,669 --> 0:5:11,479
alright jr analysis


109
0:5:11,479 --> 0:5:13,27
because they recovered a bit


110
0:5:13,27 --> 0:5:17,629
really in reality what happens is you
have some of them social programs


111
0:5:17,629 --> 0:5:19,419
its actions that


112
0:5:19,419 --> 0:5:20,42
if it's not like


113
0:5:20,42 --> 0:5:22,86
devised by sneakers with


114
0:5:22,86 --> 0:5:26,409
food stamps 'cause as we already know
again and again the which citizen that


115
0:5:26,409 --> 0:5:28,36
could mean the times against it


116
0:5:28,36 --> 0:5:29,6
black folks


117
0:5:29,6 --> 0:5:31,9
aren't too many recipients of


118
0:5:31,9 --> 0:5:34,129
about government assistance obviously we
know that i read it but you know who


119
0:5:34,129 --> 0:5:35,14
cares what will keep


120
0:5:35,14 --> 0:5:36,61
protecting the life


121
0:5:36,61 --> 0:5:37,61
is its debt


122
0:5:37,61 --> 0:5:41,3
mildly white kids can afford through
june fifteen dollars shoes


123
0:5:41,3 --> 0:5:43,93
uh... why parents out there you guys
were aren't cast


124
0:5:43,93 --> 0:5:46,159
the browser three hundred fifty


125
0:5:46,159 --> 0:5:49,909
no nobody can afford that there's
nothing to do black kids but yes


126
0:5:49,909 --> 0:5:53,1
wouldn't miss this poor kids first
people they can afford it


127
0:5:53,1 --> 0:5:56,689
and then you know we know it is the
discrepancies on that but


128
0:5:56,689 --> 0:6:0,789
when it comes to focusing on and on some
of the first clip


129
0:6:0,789 --> 0:6:3,339
because some of the river link isn't
focusing on


130
0:6:3,339 --> 0:6:4,259
that schools


131
0:6:4,259 --> 0:6:7,89
that teaches and and and uh...


132
0:6:7,89 --> 0:6:8,159
violent neighborhoods


133
0:6:8,159 --> 0:6:11,389
acquittal that'll concerns of the time
of the strongly built the first place


134
0:6:11,389 --> 0:6:16,9
the order of the league's ever said his
skepticism runs for president denies


135
0:6:16,9 --> 0:6:20,49
right in his sex is not true immigrate
majority what they do are those topics


136
0:6:20,49 --> 0:6:21,24
right


137
0:6:21,24 --> 0:6:22,659
and generated great point


138
0:6:22,659 --> 0:6:24,59
watson


139
0:6:24,59 --> 0:6:28,59
do a segment on white kids being the
same three hundred fifty


140
0:6:28,59 --> 0:6:31,359
uh... dollars however they don't have a
white guy from west virginia on say hey


141
0:6:31,359 --> 0:6:32,449
you know what


142
0:6:32,449 --> 0:6:37,79
answering what will work struggling to
find any jobs in this community and most


143
0:6:37,79 --> 0:6:41,419
of the federal assistance to the white
people uh... and you know the same time


144
0:6:41,419 --> 0:6:44,759
they're blind the speakers just like
anybody else's


145
0:6:44,759 --> 0:6:48,949
the issue of the not to do that side
this is make the assumption that this is


146
0:6:48,949 --> 0:6:52,13
that you know black kids buying these
expenses sneakers


147
0:6:52,13 --> 0:6:55,53
ending and look what you see this more
white people that black people because


148
0:6:55,53 --> 0:6:56,969
you're my guess is


149
0:6:56,969 --> 0:8:56,969
as a whole lot more white kids by
mistake is that what
