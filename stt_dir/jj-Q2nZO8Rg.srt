0:0:0,89 --> 0:0:5,64
Last week, the fish were growing legs to
become amphibians - this week the


2
0:0:5,64 --> 0:0:11,58
amphibians lose their legs!  Butterflies
inspire stunning technology, and Venus is


3
0:0:11,58 --> 0:0:14,9
mysteriously winding down - this is
Genesis Week.


4
0:0:14,9 --> 0:0:30,53

5
0:0:30,53 --> 0:0:35,6
And a welcome to this episode of Genesis
Week, the weekly program of creationary


6
0:0:35,6 --> 0:0:39,98
commentary on news, views and events
pertaining to the origins controversy,


7
0:0:39,98 --> 0:0:43,86
proudly brought to you by CORE Ottawa -
Citizens for Origins Research and


8
0:0:43,86 --> 0:0:48,72
Education, and exclusive right here on
youtube.  Showing the glory of God in the


9
0:0:48,72 --> 0:0:52,9
Creation, and broadcasting from the
Justice League Satellite, now that the


10
0:0:52,9 --> 0:0:56,4
Justice league no longer exists and the
organization was going into receivership,


11
0:0:56,4 --> 0:1:0,45
we got their space station hideout for a
song and a dance! We bring you the


12
0:1:0,45 --> 0:1:4,2
information the anti-creationists don't
want you to see or hear.  One of the most


13
0:1:4,2 --> 0:1:7,41
talked about shows in Science and
Technology on youtube.

17
0:1:22,52 --> 0:1:25,39
your host, Ian Juby


18
0:1:25,39 --> 0:1:30,46
I discussed the fishy story of fishapods
last week - the alleged history of the


19
0:1:30,46 --> 0:1:34,62
fishees growing legs and walking up onto
land and becoming amphibians -


20
0:1:34,62 --> 0:1:39,81
tetrapods.  A wonderful story, complete
with an alleged fossil ancestral tree!


21
0:1:39,81 --> 0:1:45,99
So now we look to this weeks report of a
find of bizarre, legless amphibians which


22
0:1:45,99 --> 0:1:50,27
live predominantly underground.  Although
they are called Caecilians, rest assured


23
0:1:50,27 --> 0:1:55,16
they have nothing to do with Italy.  The
report discusses finding a whole mess of


24
0:1:55,16 --> 0:1:58,93
these strange creatures nesting in
Northern India.  Now this is not the first


25
0:1:58,93 --> 0:2:3,57
find of ceacilians, they are well known,
just not in India.


26
0:2:3,57 --> 0:2:10,62
However, you'll recall the convoluted
history of evolution presented last week,


27
0:2:10,62 --> 0:2:16,5
which has now gotten even weirder:
according to the evolutionism myth, fish


28
0:2:16,5 --> 0:2:20,52
grew legs, walked up on to land to
become four-legged amphibians which


29
0:2:20,52 --> 0:2:25,49
diversified into all kinds of other land
creatures - including cows, dogs,


30
0:2:25,49 --> 0:2:30,17
cheetahs, apes and humans....while many
other organisms decided to go on strike


31
0:2:30,17 --> 0:2:34,72
and never evolve, while still yet some of
those four-legged amphibians


32
0:2:34,72 --> 0:2:40,88
mysteriously decided they were better off
without legs, and evolved into these


33
0:2:40,88 --> 0:2:46,0
legless amphibians.  And so the
evolutionism myth takes another bizarre


34
0:2:46,0 --> 0:2:53,62
twist in its just-so story.
So obviously these legless amphbians


35
0:2:53,62 --> 0:2:58,88
have been quite successful without legs,
so why did the fish evolve legs in the first


36
0:2:58,88 --> 0:3:5,1
place?  If there was an advantage to legs,
then why did these amphibians de-evolve,


37
0:3:5,1 --> 0:3:11,2
losing their legs?
In the end, the answer is irrelevent,


38
0:3:11,2 --> 0:3:17,51
because Evolution will simply make it fit -
answers or not, because evolution


39
0:3:17,51 --> 0:3:23,9
conforms to whatever evidence it is
presented with, because it is not science.


40
0:3:23,9 --> 0:3:28,43
You are certainly welcome to believe
evolution, just please, don't call it


41
0:3:28,43 --> 0:3:30,15
science.


42
0:3:30,15 --> 0:3:35,8
General Electric released details on its
stunning new thermal-imaging technology


43
0:3:35,8 --> 0:3:39,78
last week, along with a report in Nature
Photonics.  Researchers were studying


44
0:3:39,78 --> 0:3:45,24
the wings of butterflies, and made a
surprise discovery.  The Morpho butterfly


45
0:3:45,24 --> 0:3:50,43
glistens with a stunning, beautiful blue.
It's what causes this colour that caught


46
0:3:50,43 --> 0:3:55,5
the eye of researchers and inspired the
design of an electronic eye.


47
0:3:55,5 --> 0:4:0,59
Examined under an electron microscope,
the researchers discovered the surface of


48
0:4:0,59 --> 0:4:7,78
the wings were covered in an array of
tree-like nanostructures.  This "forest" did


49
0:4:7,78 --> 0:4:12,11
several things: It refracted light,
enhancing blues and removing other


50
0:4:12,11 --> 0:4:17,39
colours of light.  That was already
interesting, but what they also realized


51
0:4:17,39 --> 0:4:24,22
was that this forest expands and
contracts with temperature, which alters


52
0:4:24,22 --> 0:4:27,96
what colour of light is enhanced or
removed.


53
0:4:27,96 --> 0:4:33,52
Taking this tip from the butterfly, GE
engineers then set out to design a camera


54
0:4:33,52 --> 0:4:38,82
that "sees" temperature - thermal imaging
- based on what they learned from the


55
0:4:38,82 --> 0:4:42,68
butterfly wings.
The results are stunning - with the


56
0:4:42,68 --> 0:4:48,95
camera able to see temperature
differences less than 0.2 degrees Celcius


57
0:4:48,95 --> 0:4:55,61
- and with incredible speed - a response
time of about 1/40th of a second.  To give


58
0:4:55,61 --> 0:5:0,5
you an idea of just how fast that is,
consider that this video is a series of


59
0:5:0,5 --> 0:5:5,27
different pictures, every picture on the
screen for a fleeting moment - 1/30th of a


60
0:5:5,27 --> 0:5:10,3
second.  In less time then it took for you
to see this subliminal message ***********,


61
0:5:10,3 --> 0:5:14,96
the GE thermal camera has taken millions
of temperature readings and recorded


62
0:5:14,96 --> 0:5:16,46
them!.


63
0:5:16,46 --> 0:5:21,63
But of course, even though the camera
was intelligently designed, why is it so


64
0:5:21,63 --> 0:5:27,58
hard for people to believe the butterfly
was also designed?  Such intricacies in


65
0:5:27,58 --> 0:5:31,75
the butterfly wing have no apparent
evolutionary purpose.  Yet it is within the


66
0:5:31,75 --> 0:5:36,48
character of a Creator God to make
things that are just plain pleasing to the


67
0:5:36,48 --> 0:5:39,88
eye, which He also created.


68
0:5:39,88 --> 0:5:45,36
A baffling mystery was revealed this week
in National Geographic magazine: The


69
0:5:45,36 --> 0:5:49,87
European Space Agency's Venus Express
orbiter has been mapping the surface of


70
0:5:49,87 --> 0:5:55,13
Venus. A problem arose when the
photographic maps did not line up with


71
0:5:55,13 --> 0:6:0,88
the photographic maps taken by NASA a
mere 16 years ago.  After checking, double


72
0:6:0,88 --> 0:6:5,55
checking and triple checking, the planet's
features almost seemed to have moved


73
0:6:5,55 --> 0:6:11,51
12.4 MILES from where they were last
seen!


74
0:6:11,51 --> 0:6:17,65
It would appear that the rotation of the
planet is slowing down - and dramatically


75
0:6:17,65 --> 0:6:24,51
so.  Venus is already an odd-ball in our
solar system with a retrograde rotation - it


76
0:6:24,51 --> 0:6:30,32
spins in a direction opposite the majority
of planets.  This is already a fatal problem


77
0:6:30,32 --> 0:6:35,91
for the naturalist theories of the origin of
the planet. But now to discover the


78
0:6:35,91 --> 0:6:41,7
planet's spin slowing down? And
dramatically so at that!  It remains to be


79
0:6:41,7 --> 0:6:46,65
seen exactly what is going on here, but
one thing can be said: If this change in


80
0:6:46,65 --> 0:6:52,81
spin rate is consistent, it poses
astronomical problems for an old universe


81
0:6:52,81 --> 0:6:58,22
- pun intended.  The farther you go back in
time, hypothetically the faster it was


82
0:6:58,22 --> 0:7:3,81
spinning - to the point where forces would
rip the planet apart long before you hit


83
0:7:3,81 --> 0:7:10,43
the alleged age of 4.6 billions years old.
We'll follow this story with interest.


84
0:7:10,43 --> 0:7:15,49
[scary, dramatic music]


85
0:7:15,49 --> 0:7:19,3
Wahoo! Mail for me?


86
0:7:19,3 --> 0:7:24,75
[beeping sounds]


87
0:7:24,75 --> 0:7:30,53
Hmmm...I forget - are you supposed to cut
the red wire or blue wire first?


88
0:7:30,53 --> 0:7:32,64
Or I could just pull the detonator...


89
0:7:32,64 --> 0:7:36,73
[dramatic, scary music]


90
0:7:36,73 --> 0:7:40,85
WilliamTyndale1 made a comment on last
week's show, the likes of which I hear


91
0:7:40,85 --> 0:8:15,32
often:


92
0:8:15,32 --> 0:8:20,5
OnceForgivenNowFree also expressed
the exasperation so many feel when


93
0:8:20,5 --> 0:8:45,58
reading the skeptical comments:


94
0:8:45,58 --> 0:8:49,66
It should be noted that I frequently get
similar comments from non-Christians


95
0:8:49,66 --> 0:8:53,98
and non-creationists.
Interestingly, I was having a discussion


96
0:8:53,98 --> 0:8:57,7
with my friend Shannon this week, and
she made a very interesting observation


97
0:8:57,7 --> 0:9:1,45
which I think is quite accurate. She had
seen some studies written up on road


98
0:9:1,45 --> 0:9:8,28
rage - how people can become absolutely
insane from their rage - completely


99
0:9:8,28 --> 0:9:13,68
irrational, emotional, even physically
violent.  Normal people who suddenly lose


100
0:9:13,68 --> 0:9:19,25
all control of reason or rationale.  This
study apparently concluded that people


101
0:9:19,25 --> 0:9:24,65
considered their cars an extension of
their person, and thus violating your car's


102
0:9:24,65 --> 0:9:29,61
personal space was a very personal
violation against themselves.


103
0:9:29,61 --> 0:9:34,32
In like fashion, Shannon I think correctly
deduced that some people


104
0:9:34,32 --> 0:9:39,67
subconsciously consider evolutionism
theory an extension of themselves - for


105
0:9:39,67 --> 0:9:43,6
whatever reason.  And thus when
evolutionism is questioned, it becomes an


106
0:9:43,6 --> 0:9:49,4
attack on their person, and they respond
with a completely irrational, unreasonable


107
0:9:49,4 --> 0:9:54,5
reaction akin to road rage.  I don't want to
pick out examples from the comments,


108
0:9:54,5 --> 0:9:59,32
because I have no interest in publically
humiliating people, but the very irrational,


109
0:9:59,32 --> 0:10:5,67
illogical, yea even stupid comments that
are persistently and consistently made,


110
0:10:5,67 --> 0:10:11,11
are made by people that I would not
consider stupid.  Why? Look at the


111
0:10:11,11 --> 0:10:17,12
comments - they're in a rage. An
irrational, illogical, unreasonable rage.


112
0:10:17,12 --> 0:10:21,46
One lady on twitter responded to my last
video response to the living dinosaur with


113
0:10:21,46 --> 0:10:25,78
"Ian, he's only going to rub your nose into
the dirt even more. You have no chance


114
0:10:25,78 --> 0:10:28,36
of winning against him. None!"


115
0:10:28,36 --> 0:10:34,11
Umm.....who said anything about
"winning?"  Such comment is emotional,


116
0:10:34,11 --> 0:10:40,35
personal, irrational - such people are only
interested in "winning" - whatever that


117
0:10:40,35 --> 0:10:48,3
means. Personally, I'm interested in the
truth, not "winning."  So let the skeptics


118
0:10:48,3 --> 0:10:50,2
rage.

Thanks for writing in.  However,
apparently you are unaware that fossil


121
0:11:5,47 --> 0:11:10,29
footprints are very seldom found with the
track maker. Of all of the dinosaur


122
0:11:10,29 --> 0:11:15,6
megatrack sites in the world, I only know
of four that had some dinosaur remains


123
0:11:15,6 --> 0:11:20,45
contained within the track bearing layers,
for example.  I am unaware of a single


124
0:11:20,45 --> 0:11:25,24
body fossil found anywhere in the
Coconino sandstone, though there are


125
0:11:25,24 --> 0:11:29,23
innumerable fossil tracks scattered
throughout the layers.  The lack of body


126
0:11:29,23 --> 0:11:33,36
fossils has nothing to do with the
legitimacy of the tracks.  Police at a crime


127
0:11:33,36 --> 0:11:38,93
scene who see human tracks can
positively identify that it's a human, even


128
0:11:38,93 --> 0:11:42,58
if they don't have the human who made
the tracks.

Excellent question, but you're mixing
things up there. For example, the same


131
0:12:6,28 --> 0:12:10,7
comments could be applied to evolution:
What practical benefits for humanity has


132
0:12:10,7 --> 0:12:14,62
evolution produced?  You could also ask
the same question for the science of


133
0:12:14,62 --> 0:12:19,38
paleontology.  What are the benefits to
humanity? The science you are referring


134
0:12:19,38 --> 0:12:25,73
to uses physics, chemistry, etc... applied
to the here and now. Both Creation and


135
0:12:25,73 --> 0:12:31,19
Evolutionism are attempts to explain the
past - it's totally different.  Paleontology


136
0:12:31,19 --> 0:12:35,4
and aspects of Geology also have this
limitation.


137
0:12:35,4 --> 0:12:40,68
In fact, evolutionism has been detrimental
to scientific research - medical research


138
0:12:40,68 --> 0:12:47,85
in particular.  For example: Eugenics. Or
Junk DNA and vestigial organs.  The


139
0:12:47,85 --> 0:12:52,4
original, evolutionary interpretation for
these things was that they were useless


140
0:12:52,4 --> 0:12:57,7
leftovers from our evolutionary history.
We now know that all of the alleged


141
0:12:57,7 --> 0:13:4,81
vestigial organs have purpose, as does
the alleged "Junk DNA."


142
0:13:4,81 --> 0:13:10,11
Creationary thinkers would claim that any
DNA has purpose - there is no such thing


143
0:13:10,11 --> 0:13:14,74
as useless leftovers. There may be
broken DNA or organs, but creationary


144
0:13:14,74 --> 0:13:19,87
thinking would inspire, not hinder
scientific research. As a result of


145
0:13:19,87 --> 0:13:24,98
evolutionary teaching that things like the
tonsils were useless leftovers, doctors


146
0:13:24,98 --> 0:13:29,2
cut them out of patients quite
regularly.....until the discovery that a


147
0:13:29,2 --> 0:13:35,23
tonsillectomy left you prone to polio, and
paralysis.  Evolution has HINDERED


148
0:13:35,23 --> 0:13:37,2
scientific process.


149
0:13:37,2 --> 0:13:42,38
The difference here is how your
worldview affects how you do science.  In


150
0:13:42,38 --> 0:13:47,75
this case, one world view expects useless
leftovers, and deters scientists from


151
0:13:47,75 --> 0:13:52,58
seeking the purpose of useless leftovers.
The other worldview would say that


152
0:13:52,58 --> 0:13:56,4
everything had purpose and was part of
the overall design, thus compelling


153
0:13:56,4 --> 0:14:2,3
scientists to seek out the purpose and
design.  Creationary thinking looks to


154
0:14:2,3 --> 0:14:7,21
nature as DESIGNED, with the intention of
copying the Designer's ideas - because


155
0:14:7,21 --> 0:14:10,35
He is such an incredible designer.


156
0:14:10,35 --> 0:14:14,91
A very lengthy discussion about stasis
went on last week, and I must give kudos


157
0:14:14,91 --> 0:14:19,75
to Youtuber Fusion840 who attempted to
explain the significance and obvious case


158
0:14:19,75 --> 0:14:25,7
for stasis in the fossil record to people
who would not listen nor believe.  Hey - at


159
0:14:25,7 --> 0:14:30,25
least you tried!  But the discussion was
ended and summed up so nicely in one
