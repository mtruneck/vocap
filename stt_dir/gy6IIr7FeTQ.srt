The next piece is serendipity.


2
0:0:5,1 --> 0:0:8,63
And I can't really teach you this, but serendipity plays a huge role,


3
0:0:8,63 --> 0:0:11,7
and you now I disdain the idea that entrepreneurs


4
0:0:11,7 --> 0:0:15,6
are lucky and it's all about luck. I don't think that's true at all.


5
0:0:15,6 --> 0:0:17,64
Entrepreneurs take advantage of serendipity.


6
0:0:17,64 --> 0:0:19,8
Let me explain what I mean.


7
0:0:19,8 --> 0:0:22,43
I know so many entrepreneurs who are like the Forrest Gump's,


8
0:0:22,43 --> 0:0:24,6
you know, remember the scene when he was meeting


9
0:0:24,6 --> 0:0:25,64
John F. Kennedy and he'd already met,


10
0:0:25,64 --> 0:0:28,84
and I guess President Johnson or vice versa.


11
0:0:28,84 --> 0:0:32,13
He said; I have to go to the White House again, right?


12
0:0:32,13 --> 0:0:36,74
So, you know, this idea of serendipity is so interesting to me


13
0:0:36,74 --> 0:0:41,21
because entrepreneurs put themselves in a position to be lucky.


14
0:0:41,21 --> 0:0:44,9
They put themselves in a position to be fortunate. Why?


15
0:0:44,9 --> 0:0:47,48
To prepare their minds to take full advantage


16
0:0:47,48 --> 0:0:51,57
of that opportunity when it presents itself.


17
0:0:51,57 --> 0:0:55,81
So, here's Louis Pasteur, chance favors the prepared mind, right?


18
0:0:55,81 --> 0:0:58,63
Have you ever thought to yourself for a moment?


19
0:0:58,63 --> 0:1:1,93
Have you prepared yourself to be fortunate?


20
0:1:1,93 --> 0:1:5,14
Have you prepared your thought pattern,


21
0:1:5,14 --> 0:1:8,68
your action agenda so that when that opportunity presents itself,


22
0:1:8,68 --> 0:1:11,7
you're ready to grab it?


23
0:1:11,7 --> 0:1:13,56
Have you prepared yourself for that moment?


24
0:1:13,56 --> 0:1:17,46
The best way I can explain it, would be to use Niccolo Machiavelli.


25
0:1:17,46 --> 0:1:19,59
He wrote a great book called The Discourses.


26
0:1:19,59 --> 0:1:22,79
Has anyone here who read The Discourses?


27
0:1:22,79 --> 0:1:26,69
Right. How many people have read, The Prince? Right.


28
0:1:26,69 --> 0:1:27,98
Go back and read The Discourses and


29
0:1:27,98 --> 0:1:29,26
I saw one person raise their hand,


30
0:1:29,26 --> 0:1:32,3
you raised it again proudly, right. The Discourses was a great book.


31
0:1:32,3 --> 0:1:34,1
And this was written when he was in prison,


32
0:1:34,1 --> 0:1:37,99
de' Medici had put him in prison. It was an angry, angry book.


33
0:1:37,99 --> 0:1:40,54
He talked about fortune as a set of wheels.


34
0:1:40,54 --> 0:1:43,8
And those wheels were turning in different directions,


35
0:1:43,8 --> 0:1:45,67
in different velocities.


36
0:1:45,67 --> 0:1:49,46
And a fortunate person is the person who jumps from wheel to wheel to


37
0:1:49,46 --> 0:1:53,83
wheel to wheel at the right moment and makes progress in their life.


38
0:1:53,83 --> 0:1:56,51
How many of you are sitting on that wheel right now,


39
0:1:56,51 --> 0:1:58,52
when the opportunity presents itself and


40
0:1:58,52 --> 0:2:1,58
you're just going to stay on it, right?


41
0:2:1,58 --> 0:2:3,89
An entrepreneur makes the move.


42
0:2:3,89 --> 0:2:5,95
One thing I had to learn as an entrepreneur,


43
0:2:5,95 --> 0:2:9,34
frankly, was to make the move.


44
0:2:9,34 --> 0:2:12,25
I wasn't prepared. I had to think everything through.


45
0:2:12,25 --> 0:2:15,97
I had to plan everything. Before I know, my competitors are already


46
0:2:15,97 --> 0:2:20,16
four steps down the road testing it out, trying it, making it happen,


47
0:2:20,16 --> 0:4:20,16
while I'm still thinking about it, right?
