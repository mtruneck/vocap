2
0:0:10,34 --> 0:0:12,72
J.F. MUSIAL: Welcome to
Angelholm, Sweden, about an


3
0:0:12,72 --> 0:0:15,87
hour north of Copenhagen, and
like most European cities,


4
0:0:15,87 --> 0:0:18,245
it's beautiful, both the
scenery and the people.


5
0:0:18,245 --> 0:0:38,17



6
0:0:38,17 --> 0:0:41,48
Sweden has had a great legacy
of innovation design and


7
0:0:41,48 --> 0:0:44,8
engineering, especially in
aerospace and automotive.


8
0:0:44,8 --> 0:0:45,51
Think of Volvo.


9
0:0:45,51 --> 0:0:47,4
Think of Saab.


10
0:0:47,4 --> 0:0:49,0
But what if you mixed the two,
aerospace and automotive?


11
0:0:49,0 --> 0:1:18,81



12
0:1:18,81 --> 0:1:21,67
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: I had
a lifelong dream to start


13
0:1:21,67 --> 0:1:23,18
my car company and build cars.


14
0:1:23,18 --> 0:1:24,76
It started when I was
five years old.


15
0:1:24,76 --> 0:1:26,61
I mean, I got the question,
always, why do


16
0:1:26,61 --> 0:1:27,2
you have this dream?


17
0:1:27,2 --> 0:1:28,15
And I couldn't really answer.


18
0:1:28,15 --> 0:1:30,2
I didn't really know.


19
0:1:30,2 --> 0:1:30,93
And then I started thinking.


20
0:1:30,93 --> 0:1:35,23
I said, when I was five years,
I saw this Norwegian animated


21
0:1:35,23 --> 0:1:38,18
stop motion movie about a
bicycle repairman who built a


22
0:1:38,18 --> 0:1:42,38
fantastic racing car up on a
mountaintop in Norway, and


23
0:1:42,38 --> 0:1:44,89
took it to LeMans and won
over the establishment.


24
0:1:44,89 --> 0:1:47,35
And I was so fascinated by this
movie, I remember, when I


25
0:1:47,35 --> 0:1:50,56
walked out of the movies, that
I said to myself, that's what


26
0:1:50,56 --> 0:1:51,92
I want to do when I grow up.


27
0:1:51,92 --> 0:1:56,15
And when you're like five years
old, you don't really


28
0:1:56,15 --> 0:1:57,64
think about--


29
0:1:57,64 --> 0:1:58,515
fiction or reality.


30
0:1:58,515 --> 0:2:0,55
It's kind of intertwined.


31
0:2:0,55 --> 0:2:2,49
And you're really
impressionable.


32
0:2:2,49 --> 0:2:4,96
So I think that was what was the
triggering me to do this


33
0:2:4,96 --> 0:2:6,58
and it's just stuck with me.


34
0:2:6,58 --> 0:2:8,771
I was kind of pre-programmed to
do this from that day on.


35
0:2:8,771 --> 0:2:11,71



36
0:2:11,71 --> 0:2:13,97
When I started the company,
I was only 22.


37
0:2:13,97 --> 0:2:14,83
J.F. MUSIAL: Is that so?


38
0:2:14,83 --> 0:2:18,0
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: So
I've always had a keen


39
0:2:18,0 --> 0:2:22,33
interest for engineering,
technical things and worked


40
0:2:22,33 --> 0:2:25,95
with cars and mopeds and boats
and electronical things.


41
0:2:25,95 --> 0:2:30,33
But I never really started
it officially.


42
0:2:30,33 --> 0:2:32,49
So we have, of course, a bunch
of engineers here that are


43
0:2:32,49 --> 0:2:37,35
trained engineers, but I'm kind
of more like an inventor


44
0:2:37,35 --> 0:2:38,6
or something like that.


45
0:2:38,6 --> 0:2:42,84



46
0:2:42,84 --> 0:2:46,32
So this is our development room
for all the carbon fiber


47
0:2:46,32 --> 0:2:50,6
parts that we use in our cars,
so we have all the technology,


48
0:2:50,6 --> 0:2:51,44
all the carbon fiber technology


49
0:2:51,44 --> 0:2:54,24
proprietary to our company.


50
0:2:54,24 --> 0:2:58,29
We started developing carbon
fiber parts back in 1996 for


51
0:2:58,29 --> 0:2:59,5
the first time.


52
0:2:59,5 --> 0:3:2,5
So we have quite a vast
experience of special


53
0:3:2,5 --> 0:3:5,84
manufacturing carbon fiber
parts for cars.


54
0:3:5,84 --> 0:3:13,67
What you can see here is the
material that is the visible


55
0:3:13,67 --> 0:3:14,65
part of the carbon.


56
0:3:14,65 --> 0:3:18,57
It's kind of a twill weave.


57
0:3:18,57 --> 0:3:20,11
And there are different
types of carbon fiber.


58
0:3:20,11 --> 0:3:23,3
There are uni-directional,
different weaves, different


59
0:3:23,3 --> 0:3:25,45
directions depending
on the need, the


60
0:3:25,45 --> 0:3:27,4
stiffness, the strength.


61
0:3:27,4 --> 0:3:29,49
We always want to optimize to
keep the weight down and the


62
0:3:29,49 --> 0:3:32,41
costs down of the carbon fiber
and to make the car as light


63
0:3:32,41 --> 0:3:33,66
as possible.


64
0:3:33,66 --> 0:3:36,31
So the tools, I would say
are either made out of--


65
0:3:36,31 --> 0:3:37,39
the tools are large.


66
0:3:37,39 --> 0:3:40,53
They're made out of carbon fiber
to make them not too


67
0:3:40,53 --> 0:3:42,8
cumbersome and heavy
to deal with.


68
0:3:42,8 --> 0:3:45,1
And they have exactly the same
heat expansion as the part


69
0:3:45,1 --> 0:3:46,96
itself, so there needs to be no


70
0:3:46,96 --> 0:3:49,94
compensation for thermal expansion.


71
0:3:49,94 --> 0:3:53,57
But smaller parts we machine
most of the time straight out


72
0:3:53,57 --> 0:3:56,51
of a billet aluminum.


73
0:3:56,51 --> 0:3:59,75
So here, for example, we
have a lamp clusters.


74
0:3:59,75 --> 0:4:1,81
We have turbo tubing.


75
0:4:1,81 --> 0:4:9,0
Here we have a tool
for intake plenum.


76
0:4:9,0 --> 0:4:14,14
So, then we have a lot of turbo
tubes made up here.


77
0:4:14,14 --> 0:4:15,895
So what you're seeing here
is a vacuum bagging


78
0:4:15,895 --> 0:4:18,45
process, where we--


79
0:4:18,45 --> 0:4:21,24
we only use the most extreme
type of carbon fiber material


80
0:4:21,24 --> 0:4:23,69
which is called the pre-preg
from Advanced Composite Group


81
0:4:23,69 --> 0:4:24,63
in England.


82
0:4:24,63 --> 0:4:26,6
And it's the same material
you make--


83
0:4:26,6 --> 0:4:30,87
well again, fighter jets or Indy
cars, or F1 cars out of.


84
0:4:30,87 --> 0:4:54,92



85
0:4:54,92 --> 0:4:59,67
In our carbon fiber monocoque,
we actually have aluminum


86
0:4:59,67 --> 0:5:1,65
honeycomb inside.


87
0:5:1,65 --> 0:5:4,91
And this is very unusual
for a road car.


88
0:5:4,91 --> 0:5:10,4
I think, well, let's say most
Formula One carbon tops, they


89
0:5:10,4 --> 0:5:12,33
use aluminum honeycomb.


90
0:5:12,33 --> 0:5:15,65
The advantage of aluminum
honeycomb, compared to other


91
0:5:15,65 --> 0:5:17,92
types of core structures or
other types of honeycomb


92
0:5:17,92 --> 0:5:21,49
materials, is that it's very
crash absorbent and it holds


93
0:5:21,49 --> 0:5:25,18
the pieces together very well
in an accident situation.


94
0:5:25,18 --> 0:5:28,44
But the negative side is it's
very expensive to work with


95
0:5:28,44 --> 0:5:30,6
and takes a long time
to implement.


96
0:5:30,6 --> 0:5:35,5
And as far as I'm aware, we're
the only road car manufacturer


97
0:5:35,5 --> 0:5:39,79
with a carbon fiber monocoque
that actually use aluminum


98
0:5:39,79 --> 0:5:40,98
honeycomb in the monocoque.


99
0:5:40,98 --> 0:5:45,6
So it makes it basically safer,
extremely strong.


100
0:5:45,6 --> 0:5:47,82
But it takes more time
and more cost.


101
0:5:47,82 --> 0:5:51,4
But I think, in a car like
this, that's acceptable.


102
0:5:51,4 --> 0:5:55,73
If you look at these two pieces,
they almost have the


103
0:5:55,73 --> 0:5:58,82
same stiffness, but this
has the core inside.


104
0:5:58,82 --> 0:6:1,16
And this is just solid carbon.


105
0:6:1,16 --> 0:6:3,34
So it saves a lot of weight.


106
0:6:3,34 --> 0:6:7,7
You maintain the stiffness, but
of course, you reduce some


107
0:6:7,7 --> 0:6:11,3
of this strength due to
that it's less carbon.


108
0:6:11,3 --> 0:6:13,97
But still, it's massively
stronger than anything else of


109
0:6:13,97 --> 0:6:17,98
the same size, shape
and weight.


110
0:6:17,98 --> 0:6:23,21
So what we're seeing here is
what we call Station 2.


111
0:6:23,21 --> 0:6:26,36
By this time, we've made all
the carbon fiber bits and


112
0:6:26,36 --> 0:6:29,41
pieces and received them
from our suppliers.


113
0:6:29,41 --> 0:6:32,7
And then we put them on this
fixture and pre-fit everything


114
0:6:32,7 --> 0:6:36,56
prior to paint, and make sure
everything aligns perfectly.


115
0:6:36,56 --> 0:6:39,18
And if there are any specific
customer demands to the body


116
0:6:39,18 --> 0:6:45,29
work, we adjust it here and
custom fabricate parts, if


117
0:6:45,29 --> 0:6:46,87
there's a need for that.


118
0:6:46,87 --> 0:6:51,33
And then we take it all apart
and send it to the paint shop.


119
0:6:51,33 --> 0:6:52,48
J.F. MUSIAL: Is everything
painted here?


120
0:6:52,48 --> 0:6:54,55
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG:
Everything is painted here.


121
0:6:54,55 --> 0:6:58,42
I jokingly say that when people
ask how much can you


122
0:6:58,42 --> 0:7:1,93
customize, and I say, well, if
you pay us enough, we can


123
0:7:1,93 --> 0:7:3,9
build you a helicopter.


124
0:7:3,9 --> 0:7:5,88
J.F. MUSIAL: So I must ask.


125
0:7:5,88 --> 0:7:6,87
How old are you?


126
0:7:6,87 --> 0:7:7,75
ROBERT BERWANSKI: I'm 24.


127
0:7:7,75 --> 0:7:9,35
J.F. MUSIAL: 24 years old and
you're the test driver for


128
0:7:9,35 --> 0:7:12,16
Koenigsegg.


129
0:7:12,16 --> 0:7:13,7
You must love it.


130
0:7:13,7 --> 0:7:14,32
ROBERT BERWANSKI: I love it.


131
0:7:14,32 --> 0:7:15,15
I seriously do.


132
0:7:15,15 --> 0:7:16,88
J.F. MUSIAL: So this is my first
time in a Koenigsegg.


133
0:7:16,88 --> 0:7:18,807
Let's see how it does.


134
0:7:18,807 --> 0:7:19,83
ROBERT BERWANSKI: Yeah, I can
show you how it runs.


135
0:7:19,83 --> 0:7:21,108
That's the interesting bit.


136
0:7:21,108 --> 0:7:21,41
J.F. MUSIAL: Let's
see how it goes.


137
0:7:21,41 --> 0:7:26,0
And I love the fact that you
have your own private runway


138
0:7:26,0 --> 0:7:26,75
to do whatever you want.


139
0:7:26,75 --> 0:7:29,6
ROBERT BERWANSKI:
We need that.


140
0:7:29,6 --> 0:7:30,0
J.F. MUSIAL: So what
do we [INAUDIBLE]?


141
0:7:30,0 --> 0:7:31,88
That's 100 kilometers an
hour, right there.


142
0:7:31,88 --> 0:7:35,215
In seventh gear, so it's
a seven-speed gear box.


143
0:7:35,215 --> 0:7:37,156
ROBERT BERWANSKI: And now
we're on 1,600 revs.


144
0:7:37,156 --> 0:7:37,54
J.F. MUSIAL: Got it.


145
0:7:37,54 --> 0:7:39,345
ROBERT BERWANSKI: So actually,
on the highway, it's quite


146
0:7:39,345 --> 0:7:42,48
economic for the car it is.


147
0:7:42,48 --> 0:7:44,24
But you don't usually do that.


148
0:7:44,24 --> 0:7:45,77
Here you have 1,200
horsepower.


149
0:7:45,77 --> 0:7:51,35



150
0:7:51,35 --> 0:7:52,74
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: So
then we take the parts into


151
0:7:52,74 --> 0:7:54,76
our paint department.


152
0:7:54,76 --> 0:7:57,26
You can actually see
them spraying it.


153
0:7:57,26 --> 0:7:59,0
J.F. MUSIAL: And is any
color possible?


154
0:7:59,0 --> 0:7:59,83
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG:
Any color is pretty


155
0:7:59,83 --> 0:8:0,92
much possible, yes.


156
0:8:0,92 --> 0:8:2,42
We have our own mixing room.


157
0:8:2,42 --> 0:8:5,91
We, actually, even come up with
our own paint mixtures.


158
0:8:5,91 --> 0:8:11,1
We're very proud of our paint
result because we put a lot of


159
0:8:11,1 --> 0:8:12,85
effort into it.


160
0:8:12,85 --> 0:8:15,54
Let's say that the thickness
of the clear coat is about


161
0:8:15,54 --> 0:8:18,53
three, four times that of
a normal production car.


162
0:8:18,53 --> 0:8:21,7
That adds a little bit of
weight, but it also means you


163
0:8:21,7 --> 0:8:26,24
get a fantastic gloss and the
ability to polish for a long


164
0:8:26,24 --> 0:8:29,78
time and polish out scratches
and stuff like that.


165
0:8:29,78 --> 0:8:32,549
And you get this very
deep sensation when


166
0:8:32,549 --> 0:8:34,799
you look at the car.


167
0:8:34,799 --> 0:8:37,72
And there's a lot of specialist
polishing companies


168
0:8:37,72 --> 0:8:40,429
around the world that work with
all these hypercars and


169
0:8:40,429 --> 0:8:43,935
many of them tell us that they
really like to work on our


170
0:8:43,935 --> 0:8:45,63
cars because they're
really the top.


171
0:8:45,63 --> 0:8:52,16



172
0:8:52,16 --> 0:8:54,54
What I noted was that people
close the door like this and


173
0:8:54,54 --> 0:8:56,11
then they want to walk away.


174
0:8:56,11 --> 0:8:58,18
They didn't want to push it
down and then push it in.


175
0:8:58,18 --> 0:9:2,168
Because a 2-step motion
is not natural.


176
0:9:2,168 --> 0:9:3,48
J.F. MUSIAL: Especially
for a door.


177
0:9:3,48 --> 0:9:4,87
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG:
You're not used to that.


178
0:9:4,87 --> 0:9:6,99
People are used to slamming
the door and going.


179
0:9:6,99 --> 0:9:8,78
And here you have to push it
down and then push it in.


180
0:9:8,78 --> 0:9:11,56
So I said, there must
be a way that can


181
0:9:11,56 --> 0:9:13,83
be done in one motion.


182
0:9:13,83 --> 0:9:17,96
And that's when I came up with
this idea that it's actually


183
0:9:17,96 --> 0:9:19,71
not a 2-step process.


184
0:9:19,71 --> 0:9:21,84
And most people, at the time,
thought that's impossible


185
0:9:21,84 --> 0:9:25,9
because how can you slide in
and down at the same time


186
0:9:25,9 --> 0:9:26,68
without hitting and getting
the rubber seals


187
0:9:26,68 --> 0:9:28,1
to seal and so on.


188
0:9:28,1 --> 0:9:30,9
And that's where we have to
really engineer the whole


189
0:9:30,9 --> 0:9:34,6
entry of the car to the movement
of the hinge, and the


190
0:9:34,6 --> 0:9:37,52
movement of the hinge to
the entry of the car.


191
0:9:37,52 --> 0:9:39,87
A properly engineered
part, when you look


192
0:9:39,87 --> 0:9:40,99
at it, looks natural.


193
0:9:40,99 --> 0:9:44,57
But to get the complex function
looking simple and


194
0:9:44,57 --> 0:9:46,35
natural, that's really
difficult.


195
0:9:46,35 --> 0:9:49,41
So we spent thousands of hours
developing this hinge.


196
0:9:49,41 --> 0:9:52,11
And it's not only the hinge,
it's how it's combined with


197
0:9:52,11 --> 0:9:53,3
the whole car.


198
0:9:53,3 --> 0:9:54,93
It's the shape of the door.


199
0:9:54,93 --> 0:9:56,56
It's the angle of
the door seals.


200
0:9:56,56 --> 0:9:57,66
It's how the door seals look.


201
0:9:57,66 --> 0:10:0,51
It's how it interacts with the
roof, how the door interacts


202
0:10:0,51 --> 0:10:2,5
with the roof, how it
interacts with the


203
0:10:2,5 --> 0:10:3,41
body, when it's open.


204
0:10:3,41 --> 0:10:6,36
So it's kind of a parallelogram
here, and then


205
0:10:6,36 --> 0:10:10,27
you have the helical cut gears
here, hydraulic damper.


206
0:10:10,27 --> 0:10:13,38
The door mounts to this portion
here, so when I push


207
0:10:13,38 --> 0:10:14,92
this in, you can see
what it does.


208
0:10:14,92 --> 0:10:21,48



209
0:10:21,48 --> 0:10:23,51
ROBERT BERWANSKI: I'll give it
a slow start because the gear


210
0:10:23,51 --> 0:10:26,515
box isn't finished.


211
0:10:26,515 --> 0:10:28,511
Are you ready?


212
0:10:28,511 --> 0:10:29,761
J.F. MUSIAL: Let's go.


213
0:10:29,761 --> 0:10:44,479



214
0:10:44,479 --> 0:10:45,729
Oh God.


215
0:10:45,729 --> 0:10:47,972



216
0:10:47,972 --> 0:10:49,968
That was incredible.


217
0:10:49,968 --> 0:10:52,962
Oh, my God.


218
0:10:52,962 --> 0:10:54,47
That was incredible.


219
0:10:54,47 --> 0:10:57,64
ROBERT BERWANSKI: So that was
300, and this engine nor gear


220
0:10:57,64 --> 0:11:0,32
box isn't fine tuned yet.


221
0:11:0,32 --> 0:11:3,24
So it will go better
and it will shift


222
0:11:3,24 --> 0:11:4,9
faster when it's done.


223
0:11:4,9 --> 0:11:6,34
J.F. MUSIAL: That's the
fastest I've ever been


224
0:11:6,34 --> 0:11:7,3
[INAUDIBLE].


225
0:11:7,3 --> 0:11:8,26
Right there.


226
0:11:8,26 --> 0:11:10,4
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: So
this is, basically, a normal


227
0:11:10,4 --> 0:11:13,85
chassis dyno, but what's pretty
cool about it is that


228
0:11:13,85 --> 0:11:16,88
we have the engine management
hooked up


229
0:11:16,88 --> 0:11:17,76
to this whole system.


230
0:11:17,76 --> 0:11:20,62
So with remote keyboard, when
you sit in the car, you can


231
0:11:20,62 --> 0:11:23,74
actually program the engine
and see what it's doing.


232
0:11:23,74 --> 0:11:25,51
And on these screens, we can get
the power and torque and


233
0:11:25,51 --> 0:11:25,93
everything.


234
0:11:25,93 --> 0:11:30,1
We can take up to about
1,500 horsepower on


235
0:11:30,1 --> 0:11:32,91
these hydraulic brakes.


236
0:11:32,91 --> 0:11:36,74
And we use it for tuning cars,
for different types of fuel


237
0:11:36,74 --> 0:11:37,96
for different markets.


238
0:11:37,96 --> 0:11:40,54
For example, we had a customer
in Brazil who wanted to run on


239
0:11:40,54 --> 0:11:42,1
E100 instead of E85.


240
0:11:42,1 --> 0:11:44,88
So we made a flex
fuel for E100.


241
0:11:44,88 --> 0:11:46,4
And then, in certain
areas, they have


242
0:11:46,4 --> 0:11:47,75
better or worse fuels.


243
0:11:47,75 --> 0:11:51,57
We kind of buy in the local
fuel, make sure the car runs


244
0:11:51,57 --> 0:11:52,43
good on it.


245
0:11:52,43 --> 0:11:53,56
J.F. MUSIAL: Do you actually
bring the fuel in?


246
0:11:53,56 --> 0:11:54,67
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG:
We do, yes.


247
0:11:54,67 --> 0:11:58,67
And then, of course, we have
our own airfield which is


248
0:11:58,67 --> 0:11:59,94
very, very convenient.


249
0:11:59,94 --> 0:12:0,936
J.F. MUSIAL: For any super
car manufacturer, you


250
0:12:0,936 --> 0:12:2,6
just need that air.


251
0:12:2,6 --> 0:12:5,14
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: Yeah,
I think, without that we


252
0:12:5,14 --> 0:12:6,38
could not do what we're doing.


253
0:12:6,38 --> 0:12:7,94
Because we can any--


254
0:12:7,94 --> 0:12:11,49
24/7, we can go out high speed
testing and really push things


255
0:12:11,49 --> 0:12:14,11
to the limit, so it's really,
really convenient.


256
0:12:14,11 --> 0:12:21,9



257
0:12:21,9 --> 0:12:25,1
In the engine system, we
actually have a few


258
0:12:25,1 --> 0:12:27,22
interesting patents.


259
0:12:27,22 --> 0:12:29,73
We're working very much with
the new type of valve


260
0:12:29,73 --> 0:12:30,32
technology.


261
0:12:30,32 --> 0:12:32,86
It's not implemented
in production, but


262
0:12:32,86 --> 0:12:34,7
it's for the future.


263
0:12:34,7 --> 0:12:37,86
So we have like 12 patents
within the company, within the


264
0:12:37,86 --> 0:12:39,19
Koenigsegg group.


265
0:12:39,19 --> 0:12:45,3
And then we have turbo patents,
a new type of


266
0:12:45,3 --> 0:12:50,29
variable turbo that very much
reduced back pressure when


267
0:12:50,29 --> 0:12:55,3
connected to catalytic
converters, and let's say,


268
0:12:55,3 --> 0:12:59,62
well, puts the spool up point
at lower RPM, and


269
0:12:59,62 --> 0:13:0,78
gives better response.


270
0:13:0,78 --> 0:13:4,35
So if we go around to the other
side here, you can see


271
0:13:4,35 --> 0:13:7,3
this little R thing here.


272
0:13:7,3 --> 0:13:9,75
That's actually a flex
fuel sensor.


273
0:13:9,75 --> 0:13:14,73
So depending on what fuel the
driver puts in the tank, it


274
0:13:14,73 --> 0:13:16,9
comes in here and it's sensed
and then the whole engine


275
0:13:16,9 --> 0:13:22,76
management is reprogrammed,
depending on what's entering


276
0:13:22,76 --> 0:13:24,27
into the engine.


277
0:13:24,27 --> 0:13:30,46
So the whole fuel management
system is geared to handle


278
0:13:30,46 --> 0:13:32,17
massive amounts of fuel.


279
0:13:32,17 --> 0:13:36,21
Alcohol has less energy density,
so let's say that if


280
0:13:36,21 --> 0:13:39,16
you only would run on petrol,
the pumps, injectors,


281
0:13:39,16 --> 0:13:42,54
everything, is sized for
over 2,000 horsepower.


282
0:13:42,54 --> 0:13:45,7
But when you run on an alcohol,
it's a good safety


283
0:13:45,7 --> 0:13:48,67
margin, but we can
get around 1,200.


284
0:13:48,67 --> 0:13:51,42
We didn't realize it until
recently, but this is actually


285
0:13:51,42 --> 0:13:54,94
the most downsized engine in
the world of any production


286
0:13:54,94 --> 0:13:56,19
car engine.


287
0:13:56,19 --> 0:13:58,6



288
0:13:58,6 --> 0:14:1,97
When you think of it, it's a
five liter engine and we have


289
0:14:1,97 --> 0:14:4,16
almost 1,200 horsepower.


290
0:14:4,16 --> 0:14:9,79
So you have like 228
horsepower per


291
0:14:9,79 --> 0:14:10,84
liter engine volume.


292
0:14:10,84 --> 0:14:13,74
That's 33% percent higher
than any other


293
0:14:13,74 --> 0:14:17,74
production car in the world.


294
0:14:17,74 --> 0:14:21,24
There are 214 Newton meters of
torque per liter, which I


295
0:14:21,24 --> 0:14:24,26
don't know exactly what it
equates to in foot-pounds.


296
0:14:24,26 --> 0:14:28,25
We have six horsepower per kilo
engine weight, which is


297
0:14:28,25 --> 0:14:32,97
100% more horsepower per kilo
than the nearest other


298
0:14:32,97 --> 0:14:34,22
production car engine.


299
0:14:34,22 --> 0:15:1,74



300
0:15:1,74 --> 0:15:1,499
J.F. MUSIAL: That's incredible
how it's so


301
0:15:1,499 --> 0:15:3,59
steady at that speed.


302
0:15:3,59 --> 0:15:4,54
Oh, my God.


303
0:15:4,54 --> 0:15:7,99
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG:
That was 315.


304
0:15:7,99 --> 0:15:9,64
And you don't need to hold the
steering wheel when you brake


305
0:15:9,64 --> 0:15:13,22
either because it's so stable
and it's so high.


306
0:15:13,22 --> 0:15:14,78
This is station four, here.


307
0:15:14,78 --> 0:15:15,35
SPEAKER 1: Four, okay.


308
0:15:15,35 --> 0:15:15,77
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: Yes.


309
0:15:15,77 --> 0:15:19,8
So here the monocoque comes
clear coated in the areas


310
0:15:19,8 --> 0:15:21,99
needed from the paint job.


311
0:15:21,99 --> 0:15:26,29
And we fit a lot of wiring
harnesses, electrical systems,


312
0:15:26,29 --> 0:15:33,14
dry sump tank, oil cooler, air
conditioning condenser.


313
0:15:33,14 --> 0:15:34,87
This is kind of interesting.


314
0:15:34,87 --> 0:15:39,48
We have a lithium iron, not ion,
iron battery because it's


315
0:15:39,48 --> 0:15:43,35
safer, instead of normal
lead based batteries.


316
0:15:43,35 --> 0:15:46,25
So it basically has half
the size and a


317
0:15:46,25 --> 0:15:47,72
third of the weight.


318
0:15:47,72 --> 0:15:50,21
And we put it very centrally
in the car, even though it


319
0:15:50,21 --> 0:15:52,13
doesn't weigh that
much anymore.


320
0:15:52,13 --> 0:15:55,283
It's the center part of the car,
to try to keep the mass


321
0:15:55,283 --> 0:15:57,33
in the center as much
as possible.


322
0:15:57,33 --> 0:16:0,42
This is also why the fuel tanks
are actually inside the


323
0:16:0,42 --> 0:16:2,44
carbon monocoque.


324
0:16:2,44 --> 0:16:5,555
So the fuel tanks are in here,
the back, and there.


325
0:16:5,555 --> 0:16:8,505
And it's only one piece, like
a big horseshoe tank.


326
0:16:8,505 --> 0:16:9,42
J.F. MUSIAL: Oh, so
they're all--


327
0:16:9,42 --> 0:16:9,848
That's good to know.


328
0:16:9,848 --> 0:16:11,56
They're all physically
connected.


329
0:16:11,56 --> 0:16:12,3
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG:
No, you only fill


330
0:16:12,3 --> 0:16:12,94
it up from one point.


331
0:16:12,94 --> 0:16:14,71
It's one huge tank, like that.


332
0:16:14,71 --> 0:16:17,77
And this is, as far as we can
see, the absolutely best


333
0:16:17,77 --> 0:16:21,36
position for a fuel tank because
it's, again, central.


334
0:16:21,36 --> 0:16:25,16
Most of it is extremely low down
and it's definitely the


335
0:16:25,16 --> 0:16:26,81
most safe area of the car.


336
0:16:26,81 --> 0:16:28,96
It's protected by the monocoque


337
0:16:28,96 --> 0:16:30,88
being inside the monocoque.


338
0:16:30,88 --> 0:16:32,56
And that makes it
very complex.


339
0:16:32,56 --> 0:16:36,26
It's like, almost, a airplane
fuel tank, if you consider


340
0:16:36,26 --> 0:16:37,54
them being in the wings.


341
0:16:37,54 --> 0:16:41,11
Even though we don't have
a roof helping out as a


342
0:16:41,11 --> 0:16:44,25
stiffening structure, as far as
we are aware, we have the


343
0:16:44,25 --> 0:16:48,44
stiffest carbon monocoque,
whether it has a roof or not.


344
0:16:48,44 --> 0:16:52,37
Because it actually has 65,000
Newton meters per degree's


345
0:16:52,37 --> 0:16:53,81
difference.


346
0:16:53,81 --> 0:16:56,99
And if you look at how massive
these sections are, it becomes


347
0:16:56,99 --> 0:16:58,21
understandable.


348
0:16:58,21 --> 0:17:1,37
Of course, if you would put a
fixed roof in it, it would be


349
0:17:1,37 --> 0:17:4,18
even better, but it's still
extremely high.


350
0:17:4,18 --> 0:17:6,3
Inside there, we have
the honeycomb.


351
0:17:6,3 --> 0:17:9,79
And then you have this massive
section of 21 layers of carbon


352
0:17:9,79 --> 0:17:11,25
fiber, uni-directional in
the correct direction.


353
0:17:11,25 --> 0:17:15,119
So it just becomes extremely
stiff and strong.


354
0:17:15,119 --> 0:17:18,8
And the weight of the chassis
is under 70 kilos, including


355
0:17:18,8 --> 0:17:21,94
fuel tanks.


356
0:17:21,94 --> 0:17:23,599
And this is also
pretty extreme.


357
0:17:23,599 --> 0:17:26,15



358
0:17:26,15 --> 0:17:29,15
The windshield area
and the roll bar,


359
0:17:29,15 --> 0:17:30,68
it's all carbon fiber.


360
0:17:30,68 --> 0:17:33,8
There aren't really
any metal parts.


361
0:17:33,8 --> 0:17:36,78
Of course, power means heat.


362
0:17:36,78 --> 0:17:39,644
And a large portion of our
market is in the hot climate


363
0:17:39,644 --> 0:17:41,91
like the Middle East,
and so on.


364
0:17:41,91 --> 0:17:44,72
And we heard many horror stories
about even famous


365
0:17:44,72 --> 0:17:46,74
brands, big car manufacturers
having


366
0:17:46,74 --> 0:17:48,41
issues in those regions.


367
0:17:48,41 --> 0:17:50,7
Our first customers came from
that region and they said,


368
0:17:50,7 --> 0:17:55,1
whatever you do, put as big of a
water radiator that you can.


369
0:17:55,1 --> 0:17:56,615
And we told them, well, OK,
we would calculate it.


370
0:17:56,615 --> 0:17:58,342
We need a certain size
and we'll test it.


371
0:17:58,342 --> 0:18:0,21
And they said, forget
about that.


372
0:18:0,21 --> 0:18:1,56
Put the biggest you can.


373
0:18:1,56 --> 0:18:2,69
Everyone can [INAUDIBLE].


374
0:18:2,69 --> 0:18:4,15
That doesn't mean anything.


375
0:18:4,15 --> 0:18:5,52
Just put a huge one in.


376
0:18:5,52 --> 0:18:8,27
So we managed to extend
it this much from our


377
0:18:8,27 --> 0:18:8,82
calculations.


378
0:18:8,82 --> 0:18:11,1
We never ever had any issues.


379
0:18:11,1 --> 0:18:13,35
Even parts like this that look
standard are actually


380
0:18:13,35 --> 0:18:15,18
specially manufactured
to control


381
0:18:15,18 --> 0:18:16,96
airflow out of the car.


382
0:18:16,96 --> 0:18:21,35
This is just a water bottle,
but it's our own.


383
0:18:21,35 --> 0:18:23,346
J.F. MUSIAL: Very cool,
thank you, Robert.


384
0:18:23,346 --> 0:18:23,845
ROBERT BERWANSKI:
You're welcome.


385
0:18:23,845 --> 0:18:26,34
I could show you some
[INAUDIBLE] as well.


386
0:18:26,34 --> 0:18:27,59
J.F. MUSIAL: Sure, why not?


387
0:18:27,59 --> 0:18:57,278



388
0:18:57,278 --> 0:18:58,775
ROBERT BERWANSKI:
That was 220.


389
0:18:58,775 --> 0:19:25,721
J.F. MUSIAL: 220 sideways.


390
0:19:25,721 --> 0:19:28,61
You are insane.


391
0:19:28,61 --> 0:19:31,998
You have the best job in
the entire g-d world.


392
0:19:31,998 --> 0:19:33,934
Robert, you really are--


393
0:19:33,934 --> 0:19:36,594
at 24 years old, you are one of
the luckiest people to ever


394
0:19:36,594 --> 0:19:38,58
face this earth.


395
0:19:38,58 --> 0:19:39,64
ROBERT BERWANSKI: I know.


396
0:19:39,64 --> 0:19:40,906
J.F. MUSIAL: You're
very lucky.


397
0:19:40,906 --> 0:19:42,44
Thank you so much, Robert.


398
0:19:42,44 --> 0:19:44,304
ROBERT BERWANSKI:
You're welcome.


399
0:19:44,304 --> 0:19:44,77
J.F. MUSIAL: That was
such a pleasure.


400
0:19:44,77 --> 0:19:46,634
I've never been a car
that is that fast at


401
0:19:46,634 --> 0:19:48,498
spin and in the turns.


402
0:19:48,498 --> 0:19:49,85
It's incredible.


403
0:19:49,85 --> 0:19:51,52
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: The
gear box is partially


404
0:19:51,52 --> 0:19:53,8
developed by ourselves.


405
0:19:53,8 --> 0:19:57,85
It's manufactured by a company
in Italy, called Sima, and


406
0:19:57,85 --> 0:20:1,67
we've developed our own
electronic differential.


407
0:20:1,67 --> 0:20:3,45
On the side, you can see
this black cover.


408
0:20:3,45 --> 0:20:6,51
So we can actually adapt the
differential locking


409
0:20:6,51 --> 0:20:11,3
depending, from our own issues,
depending on setting


410
0:20:11,3 --> 0:20:15,0
of the driver and driver
behavior and track and so on.


411
0:20:15,0 --> 0:20:18,52
And then, we have here, it's not
mounted right now, but in


412
0:20:18,52 --> 0:20:22,7
here and it sits hydraulic
clutch.


413
0:20:22,7 --> 0:20:25,72
We call this the first
single input shaft


414
0:20:25,72 --> 0:20:27,87
dual clutch gear box.


415
0:20:27,87 --> 0:20:31,11
When we shift, at the same time
as we open the clutch


416
0:20:31,11 --> 0:20:34,3
here, we have this hydraulic
clutch sitting on the same


417
0:20:34,3 --> 0:20:36,71
shaft, which works in the
opposite direction.


418
0:20:36,71 --> 0:20:40,1
It actually cloaks us against
the casing to slow down the


419
0:20:40,1 --> 0:20:43,81
input shaft so that we can push
the synchros much harder


420
0:20:43,81 --> 0:20:46,34
because it's already
pre-synchronized.


421
0:20:46,34 --> 0:20:50,48
So it basically takes out 2/3
of the synchronization time.


422
0:20:50,48 --> 0:20:53,95
So it's not that it's
zero shifting time,


423
0:20:53,95 --> 0:20:55,8
but it's close to.


424
0:20:55,8 --> 0:20:58,18
And it's so close that you
hardly can notice it anymore.


425
0:20:58,18 --> 0:21:1,46
J.F. MUSIAL: I always thought it
was very cool, this little


426
0:21:1,46 --> 0:21:1,96
gauge on the side.


427
0:21:1,96 --> 0:21:3,28
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG:
Right, yes, yes.


428
0:21:3,28 --> 0:21:6,7
This is, of course, also
completely custom.


429
0:21:6,7 --> 0:21:7,81
J.F. MUSIAL: So whose
idea was this?


430
0:21:7,81 --> 0:21:10,8
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: That
was my idea because we needed


431
0:21:10,8 --> 0:21:17,8
a custom expansion bottle and
it's pretty much hidden.


432
0:21:17,8 --> 0:21:19,0
And normally these are made in
plastic, but it didn't really


433
0:21:19,0 --> 0:21:19,98
make sense.


434
0:21:19,98 --> 0:21:22,3
We used to have one in plastic
earlier on, but you would have


435
0:21:22,3 --> 0:21:24,52
to look from the back and
you couldn't see it.


436
0:21:24,52 --> 0:21:26,78
And we wanted to fabricate the
one that was really more


437
0:21:26,78 --> 0:21:28,89
optimized to the shape
of the car


438
0:21:28,89 --> 0:21:30,53
And then I came up with--


439
0:21:30,53 --> 0:21:33,54
you can actually see the
level through a tube


440
0:21:33,54 --> 0:21:35,49
with a glass on it.


441
0:21:35,49 --> 0:21:39,23
And here, you can see also a
triplex suspension which is


442
0:21:39,23 --> 0:21:42,54
one of my ideas I had.


443
0:21:42,54 --> 0:21:45,34
And the reason for it,
basically, is that the more


444
0:21:45,34 --> 0:21:46,92
power we got--


445
0:21:46,92 --> 0:21:51,8
Well, OK, in the engine room
you saw the wishbones.


446
0:21:51,8 --> 0:21:56,28
And we decided early on not to
have anti-squat geometry


447
0:21:56,28 --> 0:21:58,3
because we have very
stiff springs.


448
0:21:58,3 --> 0:22:2,2
The car was light and it didn't
squat very much and we


449
0:22:2,2 --> 0:22:5,27
want a little bit of
squat for traction.


450
0:22:5,27 --> 0:22:9,6
But as the power increased
over the years, the car


451
0:22:9,6 --> 0:22:12,1
started squatting a bit more and
more, and to a degree, we


452
0:22:12,1 --> 0:22:13,81
felt it was a little bit
too much with the


453
0:22:13,81 --> 0:22:15,34
latest power level.


454
0:22:15,34 --> 0:22:18,64
So instead of building in an
anti-squat geometry into the


455
0:22:18,64 --> 0:22:21,44
suspension, which has downsides,
it actually upsets


456
0:22:21,44 --> 0:22:23,72
other parts of the suspension.


457
0:22:23,72 --> 0:22:26,46
I came up with this idea that we
put in an anti-squat damper


458
0:22:26,46 --> 0:22:28,4
instead, which we call the
triplex suspension.


459
0:22:28,4 --> 0:22:31,75
So when it squat, it actually
pushes from both sides, and it


460
0:22:31,75 --> 0:22:33,61
means double the speed
compared to the


461
0:22:33,61 --> 0:22:35,11
normal shock absorber.


462
0:22:35,11 --> 0:22:41,5
So it calms down the squat, but
it doesn't, in cornering,


463
0:22:41,5 --> 0:22:41,6
do anything.


464
0:22:41,6 --> 0:22:43,44
You just go sideways.


465
0:22:43,44 --> 0:22:46,26
Unless you hit something with
one wheel, it starts doing it


466
0:22:46,26 --> 0:22:46,36
a little bit.


467
0:22:46,36 --> 0:22:47,36
So it's about fine tune.


468
0:22:47,36 --> 0:22:50,33
It's kind of a new dimension,
another dimension of shock


469
0:22:50,33 --> 0:22:53,7
absorbing compared to just
having two separate ones.


470
0:22:53,7 --> 0:22:59,77
It adds a little bit of weight
but it controls the squat and


471
0:22:59,77 --> 0:23:4,5
it maintains a very clean,
true suspension geometry.


472
0:23:4,5 --> 0:23:7,72
You can only drive really fast
if you feel safe and it's easy


473
0:23:7,72 --> 0:23:9,2
to control.


474
0:23:9,2 --> 0:23:12,12
So you can see how very
calm it is with


475
0:23:12,12 --> 0:23:14,5
this enormous power.


476
0:23:14,5 --> 0:23:16,2
It's totally controlled.


477
0:23:16,2 --> 0:23:18,98
When we did this world record
in braking and acceleration,


478
0:23:18,98 --> 0:23:20,89
you can do that record,
basically, with a finger on


479
0:23:20,89 --> 0:23:24,18
the steering wheel, full
break from 300.


480
0:23:24,18 --> 0:23:25,46
It doesn't do anything
like this.


481
0:23:25,46 --> 0:23:27,525
It's just track solid, yeah.


482
0:23:27,525 --> 0:23:39,886



483
0:23:39,886 --> 0:23:41,136
ROBERT BERWANSKI: I got it.


484
0:23:41,136 --> 0:23:49,59



485
0:23:49,59 --> 0:23:51,34
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: This
is also our own product.


486
0:23:51,34 --> 0:23:54,18
We even go in and engineer
all the switch gears and


487
0:23:54,18 --> 0:23:56,93
everything inside these paddles
because it needs to


488
0:23:56,93 --> 0:23:58,3
have the right feel.


489
0:23:58,3 --> 0:24:2,9
I want kind of a trigger feel.


490
0:24:2,9 --> 0:24:4,64
You can't go halfway.


491
0:24:4,64 --> 0:24:7,62
It's either you've pushed it or
you haven't, so it's a very


492
0:24:7,62 --> 0:24:10,37
clear, distinctive feel to it.


493
0:24:10,37 --> 0:24:15,45
And then, underneath this
leather, it's actually a foam


494
0:24:15,45 --> 0:24:17,35
core to make a soft grip.


495
0:24:17,35 --> 0:24:19,665
And underneath that, it's a
hollow carbon structure made


496
0:24:19,665 --> 0:24:20,7
in one piece.


497
0:24:20,7 --> 0:24:25,28
This is what we call alignment
PDI test driving.


498
0:24:25,28 --> 0:24:27,32
Actually this station goes all
the way over there because


499
0:24:27,32 --> 0:24:28,67
that's the washing area.


500
0:24:28,67 --> 0:24:33,34
We have wheel alignment, corner
waiting and then a test


501
0:24:33,34 --> 0:24:34,44
track outdoors.


502
0:24:34,44 --> 0:24:38,49
Here we take care of our test
cars, our prototypes.


503
0:24:38,49 --> 0:24:43,14
We have four service mechanics
in here and they also service


504
0:24:43,14 --> 0:24:46,78
customer cars, for example,
where we have customers where


505
0:24:46,78 --> 0:24:49,92
we have no dealers, we either
fly these guys out there to


506
0:24:49,92 --> 0:24:53,35
service the car or they
fly their car here to


507
0:24:53,35 --> 0:24:54,69
service their car.


508
0:24:54,69 --> 0:24:56,6
But usually when they take
the car here, they


509
0:24:56,6 --> 0:24:57,27
also upgrade them.


510
0:24:57,27 --> 0:25:2,33
We have upgrade programs for
the CCA test, the CCR, the


511
0:25:2,33 --> 0:25:3,5
CCX, the CCXR.


512
0:25:3,5 --> 0:25:6,66
Basically, you can upgrade
a CCX to a CCXR.


513
0:25:6,66 --> 0:25:11,19
And a gear 2 and a gear
R, a CCA test to CCR


514
0:25:11,19 --> 0:25:12,71
engine, if you like.


515
0:25:12,71 --> 0:25:16,77
And there is some cross, even
though there's big differences


516
0:25:16,77 --> 0:25:18,96
between a CCR and a CCX, it's
actually a completely new


517
0:25:18,96 --> 0:25:21,22
chassis and completely new body,
and a completely new


518
0:25:21,22 --> 0:25:22,2
electronic system.


519
0:25:22,2 --> 0:25:23,85
They look similar but
are different.


520
0:25:23,85 --> 0:25:27,1
But some systems can be adopted
backwards, so we keep


521
0:25:27,1 --> 0:25:30,43
the earlier cars really fresh
and alive and modern by


522
0:25:30,43 --> 0:25:33,44
implementing the latest
technology we have for them.


523
0:25:33,44 --> 0:25:36,43
And as it's being done here
at the factory, it's not


524
0:25:36,43 --> 0:25:37,31
bastardizing them.


525
0:25:37,31 --> 0:25:40,32
It's actually original
equipment, but it's making


526
0:25:40,32 --> 0:25:43,46
them stay alive and fresh.


527
0:25:43,46 --> 0:25:48,25
We started producing cars in
2002 and now, it's 2012, when


528
0:25:48,25 --> 0:25:50,98
we'll build over 100
cars this year.


529
0:25:50,98 --> 0:25:53,82
But in 2002, we built
three cars.


530
0:25:53,82 --> 0:25:56,88
In 2003, we built five cars.


531
0:25:56,88 --> 0:25:59,42
In 2004, it was seven, eight.


532
0:25:59,42 --> 0:26:1,55
So it's, of course, grown over
the years, but on an


533
0:26:1,55 --> 0:26:3,383
average, around 12.


534
0:26:3,383 --> 0:26:4,5
J.F. MUSIAL: So in this
year, how many do you


535
0:26:4,5 --> 0:26:5,52
think you will produce?


536
0:26:5,52 --> 0:26:7,16
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG:
Hopefully, a little bit more.


537
0:26:7,16 --> 0:26:8,19
Yeah.


538
0:26:8,19 --> 0:26:11,47
You saw the steering wheel
down there and we first


539
0:26:11,47 --> 0:26:13,66
designed it to print
out, feel it.


540
0:26:13,66 --> 0:26:17,2
And then I had some ideas
about this shape, so I


541
0:26:17,2 --> 0:26:18,45
reshaped this by hand.


542
0:26:18,45 --> 0:26:21,29
And then we have a laser
scanner, so we scan that back


543
0:26:21,29 --> 0:26:24,53
in, get into the computer, and
then print out another one and


544
0:26:24,53 --> 0:26:27,1
test it again until
we're satisfied.


545
0:26:27,1 --> 0:26:32,19
So we can go from 3D CAD to
physical model, modify it by


546
0:26:32,19 --> 0:26:35,83
hand, putting it back in 3D CAD
with a hand modifications,


547
0:26:35,83 --> 0:26:37,46
re-engineering it, and
then out again.


548
0:26:37,46 --> 0:26:39,28
And then OK, a couple
of iterations


549
0:26:39,28 --> 0:26:39,92
and then we're done.


550
0:26:39,92 --> 0:26:43,1
So it's really nice to touch and
feel and see in reality.


551
0:26:43,1 --> 0:26:44,62
It really changes everything.


552
0:26:44,62 --> 0:26:48,9
If you only do it on the screen
you will never end up


553
0:26:48,9 --> 0:26:49,8
exactly how you want
it in the end.


554
0:26:49,8 --> 0:26:53,68
You have to have this fast,
simple process of going from


555
0:26:53,68 --> 0:26:56,3
virtual reality into reality
and then back again.


556
0:26:56,3 --> 0:26:59,61
I found a fantastic factory,
10 minutes away from here,


557
0:26:59,61 --> 0:27:3,23
which was kind of a rebuilt old
farmhouse with the marble


558
0:27:3,23 --> 0:27:5,62
floors and thatched roof
and it was like


559
0:27:5,62 --> 0:27:6,81
20,000 square feet.


560
0:27:6,81 --> 0:27:10,44
It was perfect, and
we started there.


561
0:27:10,44 --> 0:27:13,79
However, in 2003, we had a
fire, so the building got


562
0:27:13,79 --> 0:27:15,3
pretty much destroyed.


563
0:27:15,3 --> 0:27:19,6
We managed to save most of the
equipment and the parts while


564
0:27:19,6 --> 0:27:20,83
it was in the fire.


565
0:27:20,83 --> 0:27:22,69
We just got everything out.


566
0:27:22,69 --> 0:27:27,91
And then this was still a
military area, so the mayor


567
0:27:27,91 --> 0:27:28,83
came to the site.


568
0:27:28,83 --> 0:27:32,42
It was a Saturday, and we were
all suited up and said, well,


569
0:27:32,42 --> 0:27:34,37
we managed to get most of it
out, but now we don't have a


570
0:27:34,37 --> 0:27:35,54
building anymore.


571
0:27:35,54 --> 0:27:38,17
And he said, I'll talk to some
people at the military base.


572
0:27:38,17 --> 0:27:40,57
So we actually got into one of
the buildings, next door here,


573
0:27:40,57 --> 0:27:42,4
that was already cleared
out because they


574
0:27:42,4 --> 0:27:43,51
were shutting down.


575
0:27:43,51 --> 0:27:46,82
And that, ironically, was the
fire station, used to be the


576
0:27:46,82 --> 0:27:48,7
fire station.


577
0:27:48,7 --> 0:27:50,71
And we first planned to rebuild
our first factory


578
0:27:50,71 --> 0:27:52,15
because we really liked it.


579
0:27:52,15 --> 0:27:55,6
But when we got all the plans
for it and how long it would


580
0:27:55,6 --> 0:27:58,47
take, it would take one to one
half year to get it done.


581
0:27:58,47 --> 0:28:0,81
We would have to set up
temporarily here.


582
0:28:0,81 --> 0:28:2,85
And we did that at
the first site.


583
0:28:2,85 --> 0:28:5,5
And we realized, if we're going
to make this work, and


584
0:28:5,5 --> 0:28:6,91
start producing cars and then
move again, we're never going


585
0:28:6,91 --> 0:28:7,94
to get it going.


586
0:28:7,94 --> 0:28:9,94
And then we had a look here.


587
0:28:9,94 --> 0:28:12,1
There were still airplanes in
here, and he said, maybe this


588
0:28:12,1 --> 0:28:14,19
could be something for you.


589
0:28:14,19 --> 0:28:18,5
It's not a quaint and elegant
place we used to have, which


590
0:28:18,5 --> 0:28:21,34
we really liked, but
it's practical.


591
0:28:21,34 --> 0:28:23,18
And of course, people think,
well, then you got access to


592
0:28:23,18 --> 0:28:27,27
the test track, which is not
true, because we already had


593
0:28:27,27 --> 0:28:28,13
access to the test track.


594
0:28:28,13 --> 0:28:30,91
Actually the gate to the test
track is closer to where our


595
0:28:30,91 --> 0:28:33,27
old factory was than
where this is.


596
0:28:33,27 --> 0:28:36,45
So that had nothing to do with
it because it was just next


597
0:28:36,45 --> 0:28:37,92
door anyway.


598
0:28:37,92 --> 0:28:39,15
But it's practical.


599
0:28:39,15 --> 0:28:39,53
It's nice.


600
0:28:39,53 --> 0:28:41,68
It has the heritage
of the airplanes.


601
0:28:41,68 --> 0:28:42,94
So we've got the ghost.


602
0:28:42,94 --> 0:28:44,14
When we moved in here,
we got the ghost.


603
0:28:44,14 --> 0:28:46,15
J.F. MUSIAL: That was going
to be my final question.


604
0:28:46,15 --> 0:28:46,79
What is the ghost?


605
0:28:46,79 --> 0:28:48,58
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: Yeah,
that ghost was on that


606
0:28:48,58 --> 0:28:51,11
wall when we came in here, and
you see these lines, here on


607
0:28:51,11 --> 0:28:54,83
the floor, it's where they
taxied in the airplanes.


608
0:28:54,83 --> 0:28:57,96
And that's actually the symbol
for this squadron that used to


609
0:28:57,96 --> 0:29:1,62
be here, which was the oldest
airplane squadron or fighter


610
0:29:1,62 --> 0:29:5,14
squadron in Sweden, from
the '30s or something.


611
0:29:5,14 --> 0:29:7,83
And they were called the ghost
because before, they had a


612
0:29:7,83 --> 0:29:12,58
kind of modern aviation
electronics and so on.


613
0:29:12,58 --> 0:29:19,52
They just flew on their senses
and they took off before dawn.


614
0:29:19,52 --> 0:29:21,19
And people could only hear
them and not see them.


615
0:29:21,19 --> 0:29:23,65
And then they came back after
dusk, so they heard these


616
0:29:23,65 --> 0:29:24,67
airplanes but didn't see them.


617
0:29:24,67 --> 0:29:26,94
And of course, airplane was
quite a new thing then.


618
0:29:26,94 --> 0:29:27,76
So they were called the Ghost.


619
0:29:27,76 --> 0:29:29,81
So they have adopted
this symbol.


620
0:29:29,81 --> 0:29:31,74
And for some reason, very early
on, they adopted the


621
0:29:31,74 --> 0:29:33,96
slogan, the show must go on.


622
0:29:33,96 --> 0:29:37,0
And they wrote that on their
airplane, in English even.


623
0:29:37,0 --> 0:29:38,91
Then the show stopped.


624
0:29:38,91 --> 0:29:42,76
And we came here and some of the
people working there with


625
0:29:42,76 --> 0:29:45,47
airplanes said, please can't
you continue our tradition?


626
0:29:45,47 --> 0:29:47,46
Put our ghost on your card.


627
0:29:47,46 --> 0:29:49,5
Then the show will go on.


628
0:29:49,5 --> 0:29:50,41
And we said OK, yes.


629
0:29:50,41 --> 0:29:52,37
So we said, every car we will
build here we will put the


630
0:29:52,37 --> 0:29:54,87
ghost on to honor
the squadron.


631
0:29:54,87 --> 0:29:56,12
So that's the story.


632
0:29:56,12 --> 0:31:56,12
