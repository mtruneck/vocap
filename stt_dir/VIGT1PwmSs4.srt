2
0:0:0,739 --> 0:0:1,53
SHANNON: All right.


3
0:0:1,53 --> 0:0:2,75
Welcome.


4
0:0:2,75 --> 0:0:5,8
Well today, I am
pleased to introduce,


5
0:0:5,8 --> 0:0:8,58
on behalf of the Talks at
Google program, author Gregory


6
0:0:8,58 --> 0:0:10,16
Orfalea.


7
0:0:10,16 --> 0:0:12,45
Greg was born and
raised in Los Angeles


8
0:0:12,45 --> 0:0:14,71
and educated at
Georgetown University


9
0:0:14,71 --> 0:0:16,93
and the University of Alaska.


10
0:0:16,93 --> 0:0:21,86
He is the author or editor of
eight books-- I guess nine now,


11
0:0:21,86 --> 0:0:27,61
including "The Man Who Guarded
the Bomb" and "Angelino Days."


12
0:0:27,61 --> 0:0:31,58
The recipient of many awards for
his writing, Greg's "Angelino


13
0:0:31,58 --> 0:0:34,94
Days" won the 2010 Arab
American Book Award


14
0:0:34,94 --> 0:0:38,37
and was named a finalist for
the PEN USA Award in Creative


15
0:0:38,37 --> 0:0:41,5
Writing-- I'm sorry,
Creative Nonfiction.


16
0:0:41,5 --> 0:0:44,38
He has taught at the
Claremont Colleges, Georgetown


17
0:0:44,38 --> 0:0:48,9
University, and
Westmont College.


18
0:0:48,9 --> 0:0:51,89
Greg is here today to talk about
his most recent work, "Journey


19
0:0:51,89 --> 0:0:54,81
to the Sun, Junipero Serra's
Dream and the Founding


20
0:0:54,81 --> 0:0:58,97
of California," an authoritative
and incisive biography


21
0:0:58,97 --> 0:1:2,92
of the man who founded
California's missions.


22
0:1:2,92 --> 0:1:6,57
Combining European
and American history,


23
0:1:6,57 --> 0:1:10,38
his religious scholarship,
geography, and anthropology,


24
0:1:10,38 --> 0:1:12,78
Greg masterfully
recounts the story


25
0:1:12,78 --> 0:1:15,48
and brings new information
to our knowledge


26
0:1:15,48 --> 0:1:18,99
of a man whose massive cultural
project not only created


27
0:1:18,99 --> 0:1:21,31
the blueprint for
modern California,


28
0:1:21,31 --> 0:1:23,66
but changed the
future of our nation.


29
0:1:23,66 --> 0:1:25,87
Please join me in
welcoming Greg Orfalea.


30
0:1:25,87 --> 0:1:27,34
[APPLAUSE]


31
0:1:27,34 --> 0:1:34,2



32
0:1:34,2 --> 0:1:36,73
GREGORY ORFALEA:
Thank you, Shannon.


33
0:1:36,73 --> 0:1:37,87
Who is God's companion?


34
0:1:37,87 --> 0:1:41,3



35
0:1:41,3 --> 0:1:45,91
Junipero Serra might have
contemplated this thought


36
0:1:45,91 --> 0:1:50,84
on the road in the Salinas
Valley of California,


37
0:1:50,84 --> 0:1:55,99
where in 1771 he met
an Indian woman who


38
0:1:55,99 --> 0:1:59,57
offered him "a present."


39
0:1:59,57 --> 0:2:5,25
When he asked her name, she
murmured "Soledad," Spanish


40
0:2:5,25 --> 0:2:7,31
for "solitude."


41
0:2:7,31 --> 0:2:13,4
Or at least that's what he
heard- "I was astonished,


42
0:2:13,4 --> 0:2:16,97
and turning to my companions
said, 'Here, gentleman,


43
0:2:16,97 --> 0:2:20,94
you have Maria de la Soledad.'"


44
0:2:20,94 --> 0:2:26,3
He gave her glass beads
for seeds; she nodded.


45
0:2:26,3 --> 0:2:30,19
As "the name stuck
to the place,"


46
0:2:30,19 --> 0:2:32,77
Serra made a note
to found a mission


47
0:2:32,77 --> 0:2:35,85
in that desolate, treeless spot.


48
0:2:35,85 --> 0:2:40,2
Soledad later became the hardest
luck mission of them all.


49
0:2:40,2 --> 0:2:43,9



50
0:2:43,9 --> 0:2:48,21
Serra had undergone
plenty of solitude,


51
0:2:48,21 --> 0:2:52,3
the "soledad" of the trail,
the one that surrounded


52
0:2:52,3 --> 0:2:57,44
your neck like water
at night, a "soledad"


53
0:2:57,44 --> 0:3:2,51
to conquer by singing
Matins at first light.


54
0:3:2,51 --> 0:3:5,78
Not English or
American "soledad,"


55
0:3:5,78 --> 0:3:10,21
which celebrated being on
one's own, without others;


56
0:3:10,21 --> 0:3:13,1
Spanish "soledad,"
which longed for them.


57
0:3:13,1 --> 0:3:16,87



58
0:3:16,87 --> 0:3:20,48
Serra was not about
"soledad"-- neither


59
0:3:20,48 --> 0:3:23,14
were the Franciscan fathers.


60
0:3:23,14 --> 0:3:26,73
He'd swallowed his
fill of it as a boy,


61
0:3:26,73 --> 0:3:29,94
losing two sisters
and a brother,


62
0:3:29,94 --> 0:3:33,2
working the quiet
fields of Petra,


63
0:3:33,2 --> 0:3:38,63
his home village on the
Spanish island of Mallorca.


64
0:3:38,63 --> 0:3:42,49
But his father's hand,
that leather hand,


65
0:3:42,49 --> 0:3:47,99
was always on his shoulder, and
later his confreres' abrazos;


66
0:3:47,99 --> 0:3:52,3
even though strangers in the
confessional cut "soledad"


67
0:3:52,3 --> 0:3:54,93
with their pain.


68
0:3:54,93 --> 0:3:59,9
Serra respected solitude,
the solitude Christ


69
0:3:59,9 --> 0:4:3,73
felt in the garden the
last night of his life


70
0:4:3,73 --> 0:4:5,25
when the apostles slept.


71
0:4:5,25 --> 0:4:7,58



72
0:4:7,58 --> 0:4:11,89
But Serra wasn't Simon of the
Desert, standing on his pillar


73
0:4:11,89 --> 0:4:13,96
alone.


74
0:4:13,96 --> 0:4:19,519
He loved community, loved
performing marriages.


75
0:4:19,519 --> 0:4:23,48
He traveled as much as he
could in a pair or group,


76
0:4:23,48 --> 0:4:26,3
because outside
the mission walls,


77
0:4:26,3 --> 0:4:33,25
lay a solitude so vast only
the sun could disperse it.


78
0:4:33,25 --> 0:4:38,6
Now the dew was on the leaf,
the earth shorn briefly of dust,


79
0:4:38,6 --> 0:4:41,98
dark and lovely and cool.


80
0:4:41,98 --> 0:4:47,14
The sun began its climb of
the Santa Lucia Mountains,


81
0:4:47,14 --> 0:4:50,82
casting them in gray outline.


82
0:4:50,82 --> 0:4:57,7
As his mule snorted, taking
him north in the early morning,


83
0:4:57,7 --> 0:5:4,53
the sun regarded Serra;
he dared not look back.


84
0:5:4,53 --> 0:5:9,4
The sun, warm on
his forehead, rising


85
0:5:9,4 --> 0:5:12,78
over the crown of the forest,
now arched in his mind


86
0:5:12,78 --> 0:5:17,59
above the Tramuntana
range of his old island


87
0:5:17,59 --> 0:5:23,11
and its olive groves to the
sea, the Mediterranean waded


88
0:5:23,11 --> 0:5:29,15
into the Pacific, the sun
wrapping the world in its arms.


89
0:5:29,15 --> 0:5:32,29
Who was God's companion?


90
0:5:32,29 --> 0:5:34,23
He was.


91
0:5:34,23 --> 0:5:38,16
For a second, he
looked at the sun;


92
0:5:38,16 --> 0:5:40,87
God put a white spot in his eye.


93
0:5:40,87 --> 0:5:43,49



94
0:5:43,49 --> 0:5:45,5
Anybody here ever
looked at the sun?


95
0:5:45,5 --> 0:5:48,11



96
0:5:48,11 --> 0:5:49,61
Not supposed to do that, right?


97
0:5:49,61 --> 0:5:52,33



98
0:5:52,33 --> 0:5:57,85
And just to show you how
complicated the choices are


99
0:5:57,85 --> 0:6:2,52
for a writer trying to bring
an 18th century figure back


100
0:6:2,52 --> 0:6:8,6
to life, I still don't know if
those spots are white or black.


101
0:6:8,6 --> 0:6:12,4
I chose white
though in this case.


102
0:6:12,4 --> 0:6:14,64
What I just read you was
the prologue to the book,


103
0:6:14,64 --> 0:6:16,726
"Journey to the Sun."


104
0:6:16,726 --> 0:6:20,35
It's barely more than a page.


105
0:6:20,35 --> 0:6:24,95
At one time, it
was about 20 pages.


106
0:6:24,95 --> 0:6:27,497
My editor, whose name
is Colin Harrison, who


107
0:6:27,497 --> 0:6:30,99
is an accomplished
novelist, told


108
0:6:30,99 --> 0:6:34,84
me to throw out the 20
pages of the prologue,


109
0:6:34,84 --> 0:6:37,69
throw out the 10
pages of the preface,


110
0:6:37,69 --> 0:6:41,95
throw out the 30 pages
of the introduction,


111
0:6:41,95 --> 0:6:43,49
everything at the beginning.


112
0:6:43,49 --> 0:6:46,81
And this is what
his rationale was.


113
0:6:46,81 --> 0:6:51,88
Colin said, "I want the reader
to encounter Serra's story


114
0:6:51,88 --> 0:6:56,76
right from the start and be
pulled in by the force of it,


115
0:6:56,76 --> 0:6:58,96
by that and that alone.


116
0:6:58,96 --> 0:7:2,62
I don't want you parsing
it or indicating upfront


117
0:7:2,62 --> 0:7:5,78
with the reader should
expect or look for.


118
0:7:5,78 --> 0:7:7,84
I want him captured."


119
0:7:7,84 --> 0:7:12,21
And in a way, that's kind of
like falling in love, right?


120
0:7:12,21 --> 0:7:16,52
Nobody explains to you
why they feel that way.


121
0:7:16,52 --> 0:7:18,9
They just do.


122
0:7:18,9 --> 0:7:21,58
You just do.


123
0:7:21,58 --> 0:7:25,27
I hope that's what
a good book does.


124
0:7:25,27 --> 0:7:27,83
The work on the prologue
was only the first


125
0:7:27,83 --> 0:7:34,64
of many waves of
editing the manuscript.


126
0:7:34,64 --> 0:7:40,53
It was 1,300 pages at one time.


127
0:7:40,53 --> 0:7:45,13
A good part of just 2013 alone
was this relentless onslaught


128
0:7:45,13 --> 0:7:47,77
to bring it down.


129
0:7:47,77 --> 0:7:51,5
I mean there was blood
all over the floor,


130
0:7:51,5 --> 0:7:53,25
Serra martyred many times.


131
0:7:53,25 --> 0:7:57,12



132
0:7:57,12 --> 0:8:0,36
My own editor had an
idea-- my own editor,


133
0:8:0,36 --> 0:8:4,56
Colin Harrison actually, and
my provost at Westmont College,


134
0:8:4,56 --> 0:8:6,16
had a title for a talk.


135
0:8:6,16 --> 0:8:10,7
I've given two different kinds
of talks for the past two weeks


136
0:8:10,7 --> 0:8:11,62
on this book tour.


137
0:8:11,62 --> 0:8:13,94
One is a general
summary of Serra's life.


138
0:8:13,94 --> 0:8:17,28
And I'm going to do something
different for you Google folks


139
0:8:17,28 --> 0:8:20,67
because I think you're sort of
natively ready for something


140
0:8:20,67 --> 0:8:22,56
different.


141
0:8:22,56 --> 0:8:25,47
I'm going to give you the talk
I gave my own faculty, which


142
0:8:25,47 --> 0:8:31,66
is I'm going to give you
five major obstacles I had


143
0:8:31,66 --> 0:8:34,21
to encounter in
writing this book,


144
0:8:34,21 --> 0:8:42,409
five challenges about dealing
with the life of Father Serra


145
0:8:42,409 --> 0:8:45,11
and indeed researching it.


146
0:8:45,11 --> 0:8:45,91
And here they are.


147
0:8:45,91 --> 0:8:47,1
I'll summarize it for you.


148
0:8:47,1 --> 0:8:49,61
And then we'll go
down one by one.


149
0:8:49,61 --> 0:8:55,98
Number one, how to transcend
the regional critique?


150
0:8:55,98 --> 0:8:58,4
Oh, Serra?


151
0:8:58,4 --> 0:9:1,36
That's a California story.


152
0:9:1,36 --> 0:9:4,72
No New York publisher is going
to be interested in that.


153
0:9:4,72 --> 0:9:5,22
OK.


154
0:9:5,22 --> 0:9:7,94
So the regional critique,
how to get over it.


155
0:9:7,94 --> 0:9:12,32
Two, how to deal with the
fact that half of Serra's life


156
0:9:12,32 --> 0:9:17,1
is document poor and half
of it is document rich?


157
0:9:17,1 --> 0:9:20,9



158
0:9:20,9 --> 0:9:23,51
Number three, what
is the pivotal moment


159
0:9:23,51 --> 0:9:25,15
in the Serra story?


160
0:9:25,15 --> 0:9:31,16
Not so easy to figure,
and we'll explore that.


161
0:9:31,16 --> 0:9:36,65
How to understand the fact
of floggings in the missions?


162
0:9:36,65 --> 0:9:40,6
A tough one, that's number four.


163
0:9:40,6 --> 0:9:43,13
And number five,
what techniques--


164
0:9:43,13 --> 0:9:45,35
writers' techniques--
what can I bring


165
0:9:45,35 --> 0:9:47,81
to bear after
writing for 30 years?


166
0:9:47,81 --> 0:9:54,45
What tricks do I have in my
basket and research goals


167
0:9:54,45 --> 0:9:59,86
could I best marshall to bring
a celibate Spanish priest


168
0:9:59,86 --> 0:10:5,72
of the 18th century to
life for a jaded, if not


169
0:10:5,72 --> 0:10:8,63
cynical, American culture?


170
0:10:8,63 --> 0:10:12,22
That's probably the
hardest one of all.


171
0:10:12,22 --> 0:10:13,19
OK.


172
0:10:13,19 --> 0:10:15,96
Now, I want to say
at the outset let's


173
0:10:15,96 --> 0:10:18,32
make this interactive in a way.


174
0:10:18,32 --> 0:10:21,259
We can do the Q&A in
general at the end.


175
0:10:21,259 --> 0:10:22,8
Shannon, I'd would
be happy to do it.


176
0:10:22,8 --> 0:10:27,49
But jump in if you feel you want
more on something as we go down


177
0:10:27,49 --> 0:10:29,42
these five obstacles.


178
0:10:29,42 --> 0:10:31,71
I'll pause after
each obstacle to see


179
0:10:31,71 --> 0:10:34,385
if you want to throw
in another obstacle.


180
0:10:34,385 --> 0:10:37,86



181
0:10:37,86 --> 0:10:41,82
OK, first, how to transcend
the regional critique?


182
0:10:41,82 --> 0:10:45,8



183
0:10:45,8 --> 0:10:48,27
Anybody have an idea?


184
0:10:48,27 --> 0:10:50,42
How would you transcend
the regional critique?


185
0:10:50,42 --> 0:10:53,58



186
0:10:53,58 --> 0:10:58,75
It's only a California
story, right?


187
0:10:58,75 --> 0:11:1,75
Nobody's going to be
interested in Junipero Serra.


188
0:11:1,75 --> 0:11:6,93
We already have William Bradford
and the Massachusetts Bay


189
0:11:6,93 --> 0:11:7,58
Colony.


190
0:11:7,58 --> 0:11:10,48
We have Captain John
Smith at Jamestown.


191
0:11:10,48 --> 0:11:14,6
What do we need Serra for?


192
0:11:14,6 --> 0:11:17,73
All right, I'll go into it.


193
0:11:17,73 --> 0:11:20,37
I wrote the first
outline in 2001.


194
0:11:20,37 --> 0:11:23,82
So it's a 12-year year journey.


195
0:11:23,82 --> 0:11:27,57
I toiled alone without
an agent for a long time,


196
0:11:27,57 --> 0:11:31,18
with that outline
and a sample chapter.


197
0:11:31,18 --> 0:11:33,13
No success.


198
0:11:33,13 --> 0:11:37,1
Even my own former editor-- I
had a great editor at the Free


199
0:11:37,1 --> 0:11:40,32
Press, which is another
subsidiary of Simon & Schuster,


200
0:11:40,32 --> 0:11:44,694
for a book on World War II,
about my father, in the war,


201
0:11:44,694 --> 0:11:46,36
call "Messengers of
the Lost Battalion."


202
0:11:46,36 --> 0:11:48,9
My editor was Adam
Bellow, who is


203
0:11:48,9 --> 0:11:51,95
the son of Saul Bellow, the
Nobel Prize winning novelist.


204
0:11:51,95 --> 0:11:53,87
Adam is a pretty
well-educated guy.


205
0:11:53,87 --> 0:11:54,97
He went to Princeton.


206
0:11:54,97 --> 0:12:0,33
He had never heard of
Serra, never heard of him.


207
0:12:0,33 --> 0:12:3,31
So to me, now I
thought I was holding


208
0:12:3,31 --> 0:12:6,78
onto a hopeless obsession.


209
0:12:6,78 --> 0:12:11,43
Even my old editor
wasn't going to take it.


210
0:12:11,43 --> 0:12:14,2
One day, a friend of mine
from Georgetown days,


211
0:12:14,2 --> 0:12:18,2
my undergraduate days-- his
name is Jason Berry, who


212
0:12:18,2 --> 0:12:21,24
loved what I was trying to
do and was gung ho about it


213
0:12:21,24 --> 0:12:28,77
from the start-- said send an
outline and a sample chapter


214
0:12:28,77 --> 0:12:30,46
to my agent.


215
0:12:30,46 --> 0:12:33,84
I think he might look at it.


216
0:12:33,84 --> 0:12:36,7
Now, Jason is an
interesting person.


217
0:12:36,7 --> 0:12:38,28
I don't want to get
too off track on him.


218
0:12:38,28 --> 0:12:43,51
But I will just say that Jason
Berry was the first author


219
0:12:43,51 --> 0:12:45,84
to uncover the
pedophilia scandal


220
0:12:45,84 --> 0:12:48,76
in the Catholic priesthood.


221
0:12:48,76 --> 0:12:53,42
And he remained a
Catholic, after 25 years


222
0:12:53,42 --> 0:12:56,27
of writing this hellish story.


223
0:12:56,27 --> 0:12:59,91
I have often told Jason, there's
the book you got to write,


224
0:12:59,91 --> 0:13:4,23
why you stayed after
all that misery.


225
0:13:4,23 --> 0:13:10,19
Well, maybe Francis I is
the better part of it.


226
0:13:10,19 --> 0:13:15,8
So Jason's agent, Steve
Hanselman, took a look


227
0:13:15,8 --> 0:13:17,1
and he got it.


228
0:13:17,1 --> 0:13:18,51
And why did he get it?


229
0:13:18,51 --> 0:13:21,12
Because he was born in
Shafter, California,


230
0:13:21,12 --> 0:13:23,51
right outside of Bakersfield.


231
0:13:23,51 --> 0:13:27,12
But he was living and
working in New York.


232
0:13:27,12 --> 0:13:28,3
So he loved it.


233
0:13:28,3 --> 0:13:29,755
And he knew what
it was all about.


234
0:13:29,755 --> 0:13:32,72



235
0:13:32,72 --> 0:13:36,89
Steve Hanselman understood
that the Serra story


236
0:13:36,89 --> 0:13:38,82
was one that was
important to him


237
0:13:38,82 --> 0:13:43,48
from childhood, in fact
since the fourth grade.


238
0:13:43,48 --> 0:13:46,92
Now, how many here did a
fourth grade mission project?


239
0:13:46,92 --> 0:13:48,23
All right.


240
0:13:48,23 --> 0:13:51,76
Which mission, Mike?


241
0:13:51,76 --> 0:13:53,81
Do you remember
which one you did?


242
0:13:53,81 --> 0:13:54,61
MIKE: [INAUDIBLE].


243
0:13:54,61 --> 0:13:58,17
GREGORY ORFALEA: I see that
was a mission you really loved.


244
0:13:58,17 --> 0:13:59,974
Shannon, do you remember?


245
0:13:59,974 --> 0:14:0,64
SHANNON: Carmel.


246
0:14:0,64 --> 0:14:2,515
GREGORY ORFALEA: Carmel,
San Carlos Borromeo.


247
0:14:2,515 --> 0:14:3,91
I just was there.


248
0:14:3,91 --> 0:14:5,73
I love that mission.


249
0:14:5,73 --> 0:14:7,39
Mine was San Juan Capistrano.


250
0:14:7,39 --> 0:14:10,46
Anyone else?


251
0:14:10,46 --> 0:14:13,14
Anybody do San
Gabriel, down in LA?


252
0:14:13,14 --> 0:14:14,48
That's a good one.


253
0:14:14,48 --> 0:14:19,75
Anyway, Steve Hanselman had
done San Juan Capistrano too.


254
0:14:19,75 --> 0:14:24,1
Steve was convinced
that Serra badly


255
0:14:24,1 --> 0:14:28,18
needed a realistic,
unbiased treatment, one


256
0:14:28,18 --> 0:14:31,61
that was both
celebratory and critical.


257
0:14:31,61 --> 0:14:35,24
He was convinced that the
story had ripple effects far


258
0:14:35,24 --> 0:14:37,58
beyond California
and could tell us


259
0:14:37,58 --> 0:14:42,36
much about the origins of the
Hispanic influenced country we


260
0:14:42,36 --> 0:14:43,5
were becoming.


261
0:14:43,5 --> 0:14:45,79



262
0:14:45,79 --> 0:14:48,0
So we went at it.


263
0:14:48,0 --> 0:14:53,22
And we totally revised the
outline and the sample chapter.


264
0:14:53,22 --> 0:14:57,0
But we were turned
down by 12 publishers,


265
0:14:57,0 --> 0:14:58,41
even with a gung ho agent.


266
0:14:58,41 --> 0:15:2,13



267
0:15:2,13 --> 0:15:4,97
However, just when I was going
to give up-- isn't that the way


268
0:15:4,97 --> 0:15:5,71
it always is?


269
0:15:5,71 --> 0:15:9,71
Just when you're about
ready to pack it in,


270
0:15:9,71 --> 0:15:13,8
you get a little tinkle
of a bell on your phone


271
0:15:13,8 --> 0:15:17,39
or at your door.


272
0:15:17,39 --> 0:15:21,48
And in this case, it was Colin
Harrison at Scribner, the best


273
0:15:21,48 --> 0:15:26,84
publisher and the best editor,
in my opinion, in New York.


274
0:15:26,84 --> 0:15:28,81
Colin-- and this is
kind of what he said,


275
0:15:28,81 --> 0:15:30,8
I'm sort of paraphrasing.


276
0:15:30,8 --> 0:15:33,5
I am interested in
alternate foundation


277
0:15:33,5 --> 0:15:35,81
stories for this country.


278
0:15:35,81 --> 0:15:39,87
And this is certainly one we
know almost nothing about.


279
0:15:39,87 --> 0:15:41,81
And I thought, well,
that's how it works.


280
0:15:41,81 --> 0:15:47,39
You're lost and then by dint of
a kindred soul, you're found.


281
0:15:47,39 --> 0:15:50,1
Now, the flip side to
the regional critique


282
0:15:50,1 --> 0:15:52,33
immediately hit me.


283
0:15:52,33 --> 0:15:53,59
Now, we have a contract.


284
0:15:53,59 --> 0:15:55,77
We have a pretty decent advance.


285
0:15:55,77 --> 0:15:58,66
I'm raring to go.


286
0:15:58,66 --> 0:16:2,0
The critique about the
smallness of the story


287
0:16:2,0 --> 0:16:5,93
suddenly becomes the
reality of an immense story.


288
0:16:5,93 --> 0:16:8,73
So what's the fear now?


289
0:16:8,73 --> 0:16:10,2
And I up to it?


290
0:16:10,2 --> 0:16:11,83
Can I handle this?


291
0:16:11,83 --> 0:16:14,58
I'm a literature
guy, not a historian,


292
0:16:14,58 --> 0:16:16,42
although I've written histories.


293
0:16:16,42 --> 0:16:19,11
My background is
literature and writing.


294
0:16:19,11 --> 0:16:21,615
So what can I bring to
this task that's different?


295
0:16:21,615 --> 0:16:24,2



296
0:16:24,2 --> 0:16:27,25
Well, I thought maybe-- what's
literature most fascinated


297
0:16:27,25 --> 0:16:27,75
with?


298
0:16:27,75 --> 0:16:32,247
Character, character, a
person, that's what I want.


299
0:16:32,247 --> 0:16:34,94
I want to get into the
character of Serra.


300
0:16:34,94 --> 0:16:37,75
I want the people to
walk in his sandals


301
0:16:37,75 --> 0:16:40,73
and know what it was like
to live in the 18th century


302
0:16:40,73 --> 0:16:41,84
and to do what he did.


303
0:16:41,84 --> 0:16:45,8



304
0:16:45,8 --> 0:16:49,98
Luckily, I had an editor that
divined right away that I


305
0:16:49,98 --> 0:16:54,9
was insecure and bolstered
me almost from the start.


306
0:16:54,9 --> 0:16:57,356
He gave me his cell phone,
his private cell phone.


307
0:16:57,356 --> 0:16:58,73
I could call him
on the weekends.


308
0:16:58,73 --> 0:17:0,59
This has never
happened to me before.


309
0:17:0,59 --> 0:17:4,254
It happens to very few authors
who aren't best sellers.


310
0:17:4,254 --> 0:17:6,76



311
0:17:6,76 --> 0:17:10,92
He said we're going to go at it
chapter by chapter and we did.


312
0:17:10,92 --> 0:17:14,6
22 chapters, we had
22 conversations


313
0:17:14,6 --> 0:17:18,119
of an hour or more on the phone
for each of those chapters.


314
0:17:18,119 --> 0:17:18,619
Uncanny.


315
0:17:18,619 --> 0:17:21,349



316
0:17:21,349 --> 0:17:21,849
OK.


317
0:17:21,849 --> 0:17:25,26
Yeah, the question is
what drew me to Serra?


318
0:17:25,26 --> 0:17:30,17



319
0:17:30,17 --> 0:17:32,589
Well, actually answer is
the regional critique.


320
0:17:32,589 --> 0:17:33,63
I was part of California.


321
0:17:33,63 --> 0:17:36,88



322
0:17:36,88 --> 0:17:39,29
I don't know.


323
0:17:39,29 --> 0:17:48,19
The earliest memory I have as
a child is about 2 and 1/2,


324
0:17:48,19 --> 0:17:53,82
of having a bird land
on my upturned arm


325
0:17:53,82 --> 0:17:56,5
at San Juan Capistrano Mission.


326
0:17:56,5 --> 0:18:0,9
And the bird was pecking the
bird seed out of my hand.


327
0:18:0,9 --> 0:18:2,31
There's a photograph of it.


328
0:18:2,31 --> 0:18:4,13
But I hadn't seen the
photo in many years.


329
0:18:4,13 --> 0:18:6,52
And in my mind I thought,
oh, it must be a swallow


330
0:18:6,52 --> 0:18:9,14
because the swallows
come back to Capistrano,


331
0:18:9,14 --> 0:18:12,8
on March 19, Saint
Joseph's Feast Day.


332
0:18:12,8 --> 0:18:15,171
And I thought I
was part of that.


333
0:18:15,171 --> 0:18:16,67
Well, it turned out
it was a pigeon.


334
0:18:16,67 --> 0:18:19,26



335
0:18:19,26 --> 0:18:22,91
But that early memory and
that sense of sacred space,


336
0:18:22,91 --> 0:18:24,97
the sense too of
going to Georgetown


337
0:18:24,97 --> 0:18:27,73
in the East for college,
feeling like nobody


338
0:18:27,73 --> 0:18:29,92
understood things that
were really close to me


339
0:18:29,92 --> 0:18:33,5
from California, the assumption
that there's no history.


340
0:18:33,5 --> 0:18:35,35
Californians are ahistorical.


341
0:18:35,35 --> 0:18:36,84
They're trying to
escape history.


342
0:18:36,84 --> 0:18:38,69
That's why people go West.


343
0:18:38,69 --> 0:18:44,6
Well, people went West after
the Spaniards were there.


344
0:18:44,6 --> 0:18:47,43
There's a lot of history
before the Americans get here.


345
0:18:47,43 --> 0:18:51,8
And that's what I want-- I think
I was building up the instinct


346
0:18:51,8 --> 0:18:53,78
to do this for many years,
particularly in the East,


347
0:18:53,78 --> 0:18:55,97
at Georgetown.


348
0:18:55,97 --> 0:18:56,76
OK.


349
0:18:56,76 --> 0:19:0,9
Challenge number
two, how to deal


350
0:19:0,9 --> 0:19:5,31
with the dearth of material
on Serra's early life.


351
0:19:5,31 --> 0:19:8,24
Up until "Journey to the
Sun," there was in fact


352
0:19:8,24 --> 0:19:13,51
only one extant letter
of Junipero Serra,


353
0:19:13,51 --> 0:19:18,55
up to his leaving Spain forever
at the age of 36 from Cadiz.


354
0:19:18,55 --> 0:19:21,86
OK, so I said one letter for
the first half of his life


355
0:19:21,86 --> 0:19:23,94
before he set sail.


356
0:19:23,94 --> 0:19:26,68
That's not a lot.


357
0:19:26,68 --> 0:19:31,72
Five letters for Mexico-- he
was in Mexico for 18 years,


358
0:19:31,72 --> 0:19:33,62
longer than he was here.


359
0:19:33,62 --> 0:19:37,76
So six letters up
through age 54.


360
0:19:37,76 --> 0:19:41,17
I found two in my journeys.


361
0:19:41,17 --> 0:19:43,28
Doesn't sound like a lot.


362
0:19:43,28 --> 0:19:49,6
But you guys know better than
I, what that is, a 33% increase.


363
0:19:49,6 --> 0:19:53,8
So I feel pretty
good about that.


364
0:19:53,8 --> 0:19:55,96
I also should mention
that part of this problem


365
0:19:55,96 --> 0:20:0,44
with a dearth of
material-- the challenges,


366
0:20:0,44 --> 0:20:2,31
you got to become
not just a historian,


367
0:20:2,31 --> 0:20:5,65
but a sort of
investigative reporter.


368
0:20:5,65 --> 0:20:6,72
And you've got to travel.


369
0:20:6,72 --> 0:20:8,813
I did five trips to
Spain and Mexico.


370
0:20:8,813 --> 0:20:12,78



371
0:20:12,78 --> 0:20:14,59
You've got to
focus on the myths,


372
0:20:14,59 --> 0:20:18,42
like a laser,
especially the ones that


373
0:20:18,42 --> 0:20:20,68
are most controversial.


374
0:20:20,68 --> 0:20:24,46
And I've done that I hope
in "Journey to the Sun."


375
0:20:24,46 --> 0:20:31,22
Also the challenge becomes how
to weave a story progression


376
0:20:31,22 --> 0:20:35,13
through the creation
of nine missions?


377
0:20:35,13 --> 0:20:36,7
That's a challenge in itself.


378
0:20:36,7 --> 0:20:42,43
Because no mission's story stops
with the creation of a new one.


379
0:20:42,43 --> 0:20:45,76
So you're weaving
this man's life story


380
0:20:45,76 --> 0:20:47,79
through the nine
missions, which is


381
0:20:47,79 --> 0:20:51,7
part three of the four
parts of the book.


382
0:20:51,7 --> 0:20:53,6
And you've got a chapter
for each mission,


383
0:20:53,6 --> 0:20:58,52
but then they
overlap, interlace.


384
0:20:58,52 --> 0:21:2,11
For example-- just
a quick example--


385
0:21:2,11 --> 0:21:3,9
the pivotal moment
of the story, which


386
0:21:3,9 --> 0:21:6,5
I think I'm coming
up to that soon,


387
0:21:6,5 --> 0:21:8,44
is the attack on
San Diego Mission.


388
0:21:8,44 --> 0:21:13,73
But the attack on San Diego
Mission occurs in 1775.


389
0:21:13,73 --> 0:21:16,78
Mission San Juan Capistrano
is being founded.


390
0:21:16,78 --> 0:21:19,5
So I have the attack on
San Diego in the San Juan


391
0:21:19,5 --> 0:21:21,14
Capistrano chapter.


392
0:21:21,14 --> 0:21:25,52
And those are the kinds of
things you have to deal with.


393
0:21:25,52 --> 0:21:28,43
Now, you may wonder why
is the Serra story so


394
0:21:28,43 --> 0:21:33,67
document poor for the
first 36 years of his life?


395
0:21:33,67 --> 0:21:38,544
Anybody have any just
random guesses or thoughts?


396
0:21:38,544 --> 0:21:39,71
There's quite a few reasons.


397
0:21:39,71 --> 0:21:42,87



398
0:21:42,87 --> 0:21:44,83
OK.


399
0:21:44,83 --> 0:21:47,41
First of all, he taught
at the Lullian University.


400
0:21:47,41 --> 0:21:48,535
He had a chair in theology.


401
0:21:48,535 --> 0:21:53,84
He was a very respected,
erudite theologian in Palma


402
0:21:53,84 --> 0:21:56,1
at the time.


403
0:21:56,1 --> 0:21:59,3
That university, the
Lullian University in Palma


404
0:21:59,3 --> 0:22:3,12
was closed in 1835.


405
0:22:3,12 --> 0:22:7,14
And a lot of the records, and
sermons probably, and lectures


406
0:22:7,14 --> 0:22:9,56
were lost.


407
0:22:9,56 --> 0:22:14,1
How about 1936 to 1939?


408
0:22:14,1 --> 0:22:17,1
What was going on in
Spain at that time?


409
0:22:17,1 --> 0:22:17,96
AUDIENCE: Civil war.


410
0:22:17,96 --> 0:22:20,0
GREGORY ORFALEA:
Civil war, to which


411
0:22:20,0 --> 0:22:22,97
I would compare the
Syrians' civil war today.


412
0:22:22,97 --> 0:22:30,5
I think that's the one terribly
tragic and bloody parallel


413
0:22:30,5 --> 0:22:31,86
to what's going on in Syria.


414
0:22:31,86 --> 0:22:35,67
The Spanish Civil War had
Franco wiping out anything


415
0:22:35,67 --> 0:22:39,53
having to do with
Catalan identities.


416
0:22:39,53 --> 0:22:42,53
Towns, Basque or
Catalan, everything


417
0:22:42,53 --> 0:22:44,1
was to be Castillian.


418
0:22:44,1 --> 0:22:47,582
The language, the
Catalan dialect,


419
0:22:47,582 --> 0:22:49,9
he destroyed the dictionaries.


420
0:22:49,9 --> 0:22:54,62
So Palma and Mallorca
is part of Catalonia.


421
0:22:54,62 --> 0:22:58,15
So it's very likely we lost
Serra, or at least many


422
0:22:58,15 --> 0:23:1,86
of Serra's holdings at the
time of Generalissimo Franco.


423
0:23:1,86 --> 0:23:3,99
So when you see
"Guernica," the next time


424
0:23:3,99 --> 0:23:8,46
you see that great painting
by Picasso of "Guernica,"


425
0:23:8,46 --> 0:23:12,8
with the explosions in
San Sebastian and Bilbao,


426
0:23:12,8 --> 0:23:16,92
think about we lost Serra
right there, or at least


427
0:23:16,92 --> 0:23:17,965
records of Serra.


428
0:23:17,965 --> 0:23:23,36



429
0:23:23,36 --> 0:23:26,49
I did unearth four
sermons of Serra


430
0:23:26,49 --> 0:23:31,46
to Claretian nuns in the
1730s that very few had ever


431
0:23:31,46 --> 0:23:32,99
seen before in Spanish.


432
0:23:32,99 --> 0:23:36,66
And someone had done a sort
of bad English translation


433
0:23:36,66 --> 0:23:39,14
in the '90s that I
found in Mallorca.


434
0:23:39,14 --> 0:23:40,57
I added my own translation.


435
0:23:40,57 --> 0:23:42,43
That really helped
me with his way


436
0:23:42,43 --> 0:23:46,53
of thinking about God
and grace and suffering.


437
0:23:46,53 --> 0:23:50,1
Walking the streets where
Serra grew up in Petra,


438
0:23:50,1 --> 0:23:53,37
being taken around Palma
by a seminarian, who


439
0:23:53,37 --> 0:23:57,51
was living in the same hall in
the Confendo de San Francisco


440
0:23:57,51 --> 0:24:1,2
in Palma that Serra had
lived in as a young priest,


441
0:24:1,2 --> 0:24:3,2
was invaluable.


442
0:24:3,2 --> 0:24:7,5
In Barcelona, I sustained
"the terrible triad."


443
0:24:7,5 --> 0:24:10,35
I don't know if any of you have
ever broken your elbows before.


444
0:24:10,35 --> 0:24:13,65
Like an idiot, I chased
a thief out of the metro


445
0:24:13,65 --> 0:24:16,76
and hit a little
escalan, which we


446
0:24:16,76 --> 0:24:19,35
don't have in our metros,
a little tiny step.


447
0:24:19,35 --> 0:24:21,5
And when flying as
I was chasing him


448
0:24:21,5 --> 0:24:25,38
and smashed my elbow against
stone, and broke two bones,


449
0:24:25,38 --> 0:24:28,397
the radial, the ulna,
and the tendon came off.


450
0:24:28,397 --> 0:24:29,98
And they call that
the terrible triad.


451
0:24:29,98 --> 0:24:36,26
So on my wife and I spent a
week in a hospital in Barcelona,


452
0:24:36,26 --> 0:24:39,8
all in the service of trying
to find some original documents


453
0:24:39,8 --> 0:24:41,24
of Serra's.


454
0:24:41,24 --> 0:24:45,8
And, in fact, I did come up
with an original letter which


455
0:24:45,8 --> 0:24:49,5
revealed several things
that couldn't possibly


456
0:24:49,5 --> 0:24:50,95
be seen in the transcription.


457
0:24:50,95 --> 0:24:54,95
I actually held Serra's
goodbye letter to his parents


458
0:24:54,95 --> 0:24:59,16
in my hands, given to me by
a Capuchin monk in Barcelona.


459
0:24:59,16 --> 0:25:1,62
I had to put the white
gloves and hold it.


460
0:25:1,62 --> 0:25:4,59
And I saw two spots, which I'm
going to share with you soon,


461
0:25:4,59 --> 0:25:6,92
two spots on the goodbye letter.


462
0:25:6,92 --> 0:25:12,12
Now, what do you think two spots
would be in a goodbye letter


463
0:25:12,12 --> 0:25:13,22
to parents?


464
0:25:13,22 --> 0:25:16,66
Llora, tears, yeah, tears.


465
0:25:16,66 --> 0:25:17,63
That's my guess.


466
0:25:17,63 --> 0:25:20,49
Could be moisture
damage too, I mean.


467
0:25:20,49 --> 0:25:22,6
But that was sort of my feeling.


468
0:25:22,6 --> 0:25:25,54



469
0:25:25,54 --> 0:25:30,56
I also uncovered in Oaxaca,
after some relentless research


470
0:25:30,56 --> 0:25:33,77
and coming up empty
for days, I found


471
0:25:33,77 --> 0:25:40,33
the name of a man who was having
a 14-year affair with a woman,


472
0:25:40,33 --> 0:25:46,0
who confessed it to Serra.


473
0:25:46,0 --> 0:25:51,27
Now, we knew about this
unknown person's confession.


474
0:25:51,27 --> 0:25:52,96
We didn't know the
name of the man.


475
0:25:52,96 --> 0:25:57,9
It's briefly disgusted
in a 1787 biography


476
0:25:57,9 --> 0:26:0,38
by a friend of his,
Francisco Palou,


477
0:26:0,38 --> 0:26:2,83
and then dropped for 200 years.


478
0:26:2,83 --> 0:26:6,7
Briefly mentioned in 1959
by Father Maynard Geiger,


479
0:26:6,7 --> 0:26:8,44
the last major biography.


480
0:26:8,44 --> 0:26:12,36
I thought, whoa, I want to
find out who those people were.


481
0:26:12,36 --> 0:26:14,28
And I did.


482
0:26:14,28 --> 0:26:16,5
And once I had the
name of the man who


483
0:26:16,5 --> 0:26:19,28
was carrying on the affair,
Don Mathias Cortabarria,


484
0:26:19,28 --> 0:26:22,5
I ran around Oaxaca
to five archivists


485
0:26:22,5 --> 0:26:26,3
And archivists love it when
you give them something.


486
0:26:26,3 --> 0:26:29,54
They just love-- they sit around
in these kind of dreary jobs


487
0:26:29,54 --> 0:26:34,875
all day long-- dust
of the archive.


488
0:26:34,875 --> 0:26:36,469
And it's pretty grim.


489
0:26:36,469 --> 0:26:38,1
But when they have
something and they


490
0:26:38,1 --> 0:26:40,68
know someone's on the trail
of something centuries back,


491
0:26:40,68 --> 0:26:41,91
they love it.


492
0:26:41,91 --> 0:26:43,6
And they just really
worked hard for me


493
0:26:43,6 --> 0:26:47,35
and found many of these names.


494
0:26:47,35 --> 0:26:53,13
OK, any questions about the
document-poor, document-rich?


495
0:26:53,13 --> 0:26:55,43
I should save the
document-rich part of the story


496
0:26:55,43 --> 0:26:57,335
is that one Serra
gets to California,


497
0:26:57,335 --> 0:26:59,96
you have 264 letters.


498
0:26:59,96 --> 0:27:1,41
So it's a bumper crop.


499
0:27:1,41 --> 0:27:3,28
Now, it's what do you use?


500
0:27:3,28 --> 0:27:7,51
What do you throw out
and what do you use?


501
0:27:7,51 --> 0:27:8,2
OK.


502
0:27:8,2 --> 0:27:11,78
Number three, the
third obstacle,


503
0:27:11,78 --> 0:27:15,2
trying to pin down
the pivotal moment.


504
0:27:15,2 --> 0:27:18,75
Because a lot of the editors,
prior to Collin taking it,


505
0:27:18,75 --> 0:27:21,1
want to know, OK,
what's the fulcrum here?


506
0:27:21,1 --> 0:27:24,56
What's the fulcrum of the story?


507
0:27:24,56 --> 0:27:25,61
I struggled at first.


508
0:27:25,61 --> 0:27:30,82
I thought maybe it was Serra's
decision to leave everything.


509
0:27:30,82 --> 0:27:31,639
He ever went home.


510
0:27:31,639 --> 0:27:32,93
He never saw his parents again.


511
0:27:32,93 --> 0:27:36,9
He was so nervous about
saying goodbye to them,


512
0:27:36,9 --> 0:27:40,16
he couldn't address the
goodbye letter to them.


513
0:27:40,16 --> 0:27:43,8
He addressed the goodbye letter
to a cousin, who was a priest,


514
0:27:43,8 --> 0:27:46,72
and said give it to them.


515
0:27:46,72 --> 0:27:48,38
Could that be the
pivotal moment?


516
0:27:48,38 --> 0:27:49,5
Well, maybe.


517
0:27:49,5 --> 0:27:50,8
But what do you do then?


518
0:27:50,8 --> 0:27:51,496
If that's the
pivotal moment, he's


519
0:27:51,496 --> 0:27:53,72
still got half of his life left.


520
0:27:53,72 --> 0:27:54,545
That doesn't serve.


521
0:27:54,545 --> 0:27:58,43



522
0:27:58,43 --> 0:28:0,86
How about the spider
bite at Vera Cruz?


523
0:28:0,86 --> 0:28:4,74
When he first landed in
Vera Cruz, and he was 36,


524
0:28:4,74 --> 0:28:8,47
he was bitten by a spider,
walking from Vera Cruz


525
0:28:8,47 --> 0:28:10,88
to Mexico City, 250 miles.


526
0:28:10,88 --> 0:28:12,22
It festered.


527
0:28:12,22 --> 0:28:13,96
It necrotized over time.


528
0:28:13,96 --> 0:28:17,52
And it pained him for 25
years, the rest of his life,


529
0:28:17,52 --> 0:28:19,555
walking all over California.


530
0:28:19,555 --> 0:28:24,82
A pretty serious pivotal moment,
but a little amorphous too.


531
0:28:24,82 --> 0:28:28,58
Was it his despair after
the Cortabarria incident?


532
0:28:28,58 --> 0:28:29,84
I didn't mention this.


533
0:28:29,84 --> 0:28:33,27
But the man who was having
the affair with the woman that


534
0:28:33,27 --> 0:28:37,36
confessed to Serra, when he
realized that the woman was not


535
0:28:37,36 --> 0:28:41,71
coming back to him,
he hanged himself.


536
0:28:41,71 --> 0:28:48,93
And this had great repercussions
in Oaxaca and affected Serra.


537
0:28:48,93 --> 0:28:56,42
How about Serra's meeting
with the viceroy in 1774, when


538
0:28:56,42 --> 0:28:59,35
he went all the way
back from Carmel,


539
0:28:59,35 --> 0:29:5,11
down through Baja, over on ship
to San Blas, to Mexico City,


540
0:29:5,11 --> 0:29:7,85
and pleaded with the viceroy
not to shut the whole


541
0:29:7,85 --> 0:29:13,16
project down because there
was a terrible epidemic


542
0:29:13,16 --> 0:29:16,7
almost of molestation
by the soldiers,


543
0:29:16,7 --> 0:29:23,65
of the Indian women, which Serra
totally decried and fought.


544
0:29:23,65 --> 0:29:28,7
But he was worried because
their one was stopping them.


545
0:29:28,7 --> 0:29:31,16
The commandantes were not
cashiering these soldiers,


546
0:29:31,16 --> 0:29:36,44
that the viceroy was going to
end the project at California.


547
0:29:36,44 --> 0:29:38,8
In the end, I
picked the incident


548
0:29:38,8 --> 0:29:42,32
I mentioned to you,
Serra's reaction


549
0:29:42,32 --> 0:29:46,1
to the murder of Father
Luis Jayme, who grew up


550
0:29:46,1 --> 0:29:50,83
with him in Mallorca, during
the second attack of Mission San


551
0:29:50,83 --> 0:29:52,65
Diego by the Kumeyaay.


552
0:29:52,65 --> 0:29:54,94
And I'll read just a
brief little part of that,


553
0:29:54,94 --> 0:29:58,2
and then we'll run to the end.


554
0:29:58,2 --> 0:30:3,45
In the wake of the second major
Indian uprising in California,


555
0:30:3,45 --> 0:30:8,52
Serra sat down
December 15, 1775,


556
0:30:8,52 --> 0:30:12,771
to write a soul-searching letter
to Viceroy Bucareli in Mexico


557
0:30:12,771 --> 0:30:13,27
City.


558
0:30:13,27 --> 0:30:16,69
I should mention that
although the attack took place


559
0:30:16,69 --> 0:30:18,46
in San Diego, Serra
was not there.


560
0:30:18,46 --> 0:30:19,62
He was in Carmel.


561
0:30:19,62 --> 0:30:21,1
Carmel was his home mission.


562
0:30:21,1 --> 0:30:23,3
So he didn't get the
news for a couple weeks.


563
0:30:23,3 --> 0:30:27,9
But when he did, and he knew
that Indians had been arrested,


564
0:30:27,9 --> 0:30:31,43
at least nine, and then
later a total of 24,


565
0:30:31,43 --> 0:30:36,61
to be executed-- they were on
death row-- he had to act fast.


566
0:30:36,61 --> 0:30:39,38
So he wrote this letter.


567
0:30:39,38 --> 0:30:43,86
He contemplated the burned,
shredded baptismal records,


568
0:30:43,86 --> 0:30:48,4
the stolen vestments and
utensils of the Sacristy.


569
0:30:48,4 --> 0:30:51,23
He hovered on giving up.


570
0:30:51,23 --> 0:30:54,78
He reminded Bucareli
of his insistence


571
0:30:54,78 --> 0:30:58,55
at the beginning of these
conquests quote, "That in case


572
0:30:58,55 --> 0:31:3,66
the Indians, whether pagans
or Christians, would kill me,


573
0:31:3,66 --> 0:31:7,29
they should be pardoned."


574
0:31:7,29 --> 0:31:10,31
From the very onset of the
Spanish movement into Alta


575
0:31:10,31 --> 0:31:16,47
California, Serra seemed to
sense violence was inevitable


576
0:31:16,47 --> 0:31:20,38
and he wasn't
going to return it.


577
0:31:20,38 --> 0:31:22,53
Nor did he want the
military to return it.


578
0:31:22,53 --> 0:31:26,72



579
0:31:26,72 --> 0:31:29,9
Serra's insistent
note to Bucareli


580
0:31:29,9 --> 0:31:32,89
was not only exceptional
in its anticipatory mercy,


581
0:31:32,89 --> 0:31:37,34
it seemed to beg the question
of the whole enterprise.


582
0:31:37,34 --> 0:31:40,89
This is a stunning position.


583
0:31:40,89 --> 0:31:43,83
It's almost as if Serra
were asking for forgiveness,


584
0:31:43,83 --> 0:31:49,32
not only for the
Indian, but from him,


585
0:31:49,32 --> 0:31:50,85
knowing what the
Indian was going


586
0:31:50,85 --> 0:31:54,69
to have to give up even if he
felt he was offering a better


587
0:31:54,69 --> 0:31:58,2
way, salvation, as
he understood it.


588
0:31:58,2 --> 0:32:0,65



589
0:32:0,65 --> 0:32:4,38
So Serra attacked the clemency
simply and profoundly.


590
0:32:4,38 --> 0:32:8,81
And I'll give you the
exact quote in his letter


591
0:32:8,81 --> 0:32:10,62
to Bucareli.


592
0:32:10,62 --> 0:32:13,99
"To prevent the Indian
from killing others,


593
0:32:13,99 --> 0:32:18,0
let the soldiers protect us
in better fashion than they


594
0:32:18,0 --> 0:32:21,9
did the now deceased padre.


595
0:32:21,9 --> 0:32:27,24
And as to the killer, let him
live so that he can be saved.


596
0:32:27,24 --> 0:32:29,36
For that is the
purpose of our coming


597
0:32:29,36 --> 0:32:34,14
here and its sole
justification."


598
0:32:34,14 --> 0:32:42,21
In short, "the gospel of love."


599
0:32:42,21 --> 0:32:43,85
All right, the fourth challenge.


600
0:32:43,85 --> 0:32:44,76
Yes, sir?


601
0:32:44,76 --> 0:32:45,76
AUDIENCE: What happened?


602
0:32:45,76 --> 0:32:47,51
GREGORY ORFALEA: What happened?


603
0:32:47,51 --> 0:32:48,78
AUDIENCE: Did the
letter take effect?


604
0:32:48,78 --> 0:32:51,2
GREGORY ORFALEA: Bucareli
was deeply moved.


605
0:32:51,2 --> 0:32:53,84
He ordered all the
Indians released.


606
0:32:53,84 --> 0:32:57,25
In fact, one of them, probably
the leader of the attack,


607
0:32:57,25 --> 0:33:3,94
Carlos, whose native name was
Chisli, Carlos and his brother


608
0:33:3,94 --> 0:33:6,71
Francisco, they were both
in on this rebellion,


609
0:33:6,71 --> 0:33:10,12
became very close to the
missions, particularly


610
0:33:10,12 --> 0:33:10,74
Francisco.


611
0:33:10,74 --> 0:33:14,13
I think he was a leader of
Christian Indians in San Diego.


612
0:33:14,13 --> 0:33:16,62
Carlos kind of went
in and out of-- he


613
0:33:16,62 --> 0:33:18,86
was a bit of a recidivist.


614
0:33:18,86 --> 0:33:21,34
But he ended up at
Carmel ironically,


615
0:33:21,34 --> 0:33:24,26
after Serra died, and
had his family there


616
0:33:24,26 --> 0:33:25,4
and worked the
mission in Carmel.


617
0:33:25,4 --> 0:33:29,77



618
0:33:29,77 --> 0:33:31,74
The fourth challenge
was how to deal


619
0:33:31,74 --> 0:33:33,97
with the most troubling,
if not revolting,


620
0:33:33,97 --> 0:33:38,83
fact of Father Serra's life,
that he allowed and even


621
0:33:38,83 --> 0:33:43,92
advocated floggings for penance
and discipline in the missions,


622
0:33:43,92 --> 0:33:47,6
often against the very Indians
he was otherwise protecting.


623
0:33:47,6 --> 0:33:50,16



624
0:33:50,16 --> 0:33:55,66
I'll only say here I was
faced with a twofold problem,


625
0:33:55,66 --> 0:34:0,42
a moral one and a narrative one.


626
0:34:0,42 --> 0:34:3,4
The first was
easier to confront.


627
0:34:3,4 --> 0:34:6,41
Serra was wrong.


628
0:34:6,41 --> 0:34:8,67
There's no way to gainsay it.


629
0:34:8,67 --> 0:34:11,78
Despite the fact that
disciplinary floggings were


630
0:34:11,78 --> 0:34:15,28
commonly used in schools,
as well as prisons,


631
0:34:15,28 --> 0:34:18,239
throughout Europe,
Serra should have


632
0:34:18,239 --> 0:34:22,949
had the wisdom to be as ahead
of his times in this area


633
0:34:22,949 --> 0:34:25,73
as he was in others.


634
0:34:25,73 --> 0:34:28,54
The narrative
problem was tougher.


635
0:34:28,54 --> 0:34:32,73
If I tackled the issue
of floggings too early,


636
0:34:32,73 --> 0:34:36,5
I might lose the reader's
commitment to the Serra story


637
0:34:36,5 --> 0:34:37,655
before it even began.


638
0:34:37,655 --> 0:34:40,489



639
0:34:40,489 --> 0:34:43,489
And although I sprinkled
references to the floggings


640
0:34:43,489 --> 0:34:47,179
in the book prior, I don't
focus intensely on it


641
0:34:47,179 --> 0:34:51,429
until the last
night of his life.


642
0:34:51,429 --> 0:34:57,2
And it's the end of part
three of a four-part book.


643
0:34:57,2 --> 0:34:59,65
And that night, I
begin the chapter


644
0:34:59,65 --> 0:35:1,91
actually with this
quote from that night.


645
0:35:1,91 --> 0:35:7,417
Serra says, "I have come
under the shadow of fear."


646
0:35:7,417 --> 0:35:9,0
That's when I deal
with the floggings.


647
0:35:9,0 --> 0:35:11,69



648
0:35:11,69 --> 0:35:13,34
It's hard to explain them away.


649
0:35:13,34 --> 0:35:16,67
But you have to
remember that this


650
0:35:16,67 --> 0:35:20,43
was a sort utopic
community, the mission.


651
0:35:20,43 --> 0:35:23,73
And the Indians were
not forced to come in.


652
0:35:23,73 --> 0:35:24,74
That's a myth.


653
0:35:24,74 --> 0:35:27,9
It wasn't slavery.


654
0:35:27,9 --> 0:35:30,44
It was a kind of indentured
servitude though.


655
0:35:30,44 --> 0:35:32,5
Because once they
were in, then they


656
0:35:32,5 --> 0:35:37,14
were committed to a community
that needed their work.


657
0:35:37,14 --> 0:35:39,32
They were given clothes.


658
0:35:39,32 --> 0:35:44,67
They were given food and
shelter and a home at a time


659
0:35:44,67 --> 0:35:48,74
when lots was going on
in the native villages.


660
0:35:48,74 --> 0:35:50,24
The germs were spreading.


661
0:35:50,24 --> 0:35:52,92
The microbes were out and about.


662
0:35:52,92 --> 0:35:54,75
And a lot of Indians were dying.


663
0:35:54,75 --> 0:35:58,87
So the mission, and I
say this at one point,


664
0:35:58,87 --> 0:36:1,4
the great irony of the
California missions


665
0:36:1,4 --> 0:36:7,53
is that they were both
protection and exposure.


666
0:36:7,53 --> 0:36:11,53
The Indians were seen as
children, not-- how can


667
0:36:11,53 --> 0:36:14,46
I say this?


668
0:36:14,46 --> 0:36:17,76
We've all read some books where
the padres refer to their flock


669
0:36:17,76 --> 0:36:19,12
as "my children."


670
0:36:19,12 --> 0:36:22,5
I don't think it was
you're inferior than me.


671
0:36:22,5 --> 0:36:26,11
But it was a kind of way
of regarding the neophytes,


672
0:36:26,11 --> 0:36:29,24
as they were
called, as newcomers


673
0:36:29,24 --> 0:36:31,43
in the Christian faith.


674
0:36:31,43 --> 0:36:37,68
As such, the number
of the thrashings


675
0:36:37,68 --> 0:36:41,49
was half of what
an adult would get.


676
0:36:41,49 --> 0:36:43,42
That's 12 versus 25.


677
0:36:43,42 --> 0:36:45,47
That still doesn't
make it right.


678
0:36:45,47 --> 0:36:47,204
Personally, I think
probably the worst


679
0:36:47,204 --> 0:36:48,62
thing about the
thrashings was not


680
0:36:48,62 --> 0:36:51,95
the physical pain,
but the humiliation.


681
0:36:51,95 --> 0:36:54,9



682
0:36:54,9 --> 0:36:56,96
People would steal.


683
0:36:56,96 --> 0:36:59,334
There was adultery that went on.


684
0:36:59,334 --> 0:37:1,5
I don't have to tell you
what went on in New England


685
0:37:1,5 --> 0:37:2,3
with adultery.


686
0:37:2,3 --> 0:37:3,26
they didn't whip you.


687
0:37:3,26 --> 0:37:5,41
They burned witches
at the stake,


688
0:37:5,41 --> 0:37:8,11
who they thought to be witches.


689
0:37:8,11 --> 0:37:10,6
We have to be careful
when writing history


690
0:37:10,6 --> 0:37:15,83
of what's known as the
presentism problem,


691
0:37:15,83 --> 0:37:22,32
to judge the past with
our present attitudes


692
0:37:22,32 --> 0:37:25,88
and moral standards.


693
0:37:25,88 --> 0:37:30,12
Still, like I say-- and I
make no bones about this,


694
0:37:30,12 --> 0:37:32,31
I think it was wrong.


695
0:37:32,31 --> 0:37:32,856
Yes, sir?


696
0:37:32,856 --> 0:37:33,772
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].


697
0:37:33,772 --> 0:37:38,549



698
0:37:38,549 --> 0:37:40,9
GREGORY ORFALEA: It
was actually part


699
0:37:40,9 --> 0:37:43,45
of the whole Spanish project.


700
0:37:43,45 --> 0:37:45,9
And, in fact, it was part
of the English project.


701
0:37:45,9 --> 0:37:47,95
The English thrashed
their students


702
0:37:47,95 --> 0:37:51,16
at prep schools, such as Eaton.


703
0:37:51,16 --> 0:37:51,79
What was it?


704
0:37:51,79 --> 0:37:54,35



705
0:37:54,35 --> 0:37:57,9
Four thrashings was a scrubbing.


706
0:37:57,9 --> 0:38:4,35
Six lashes was a
bibling in Eaton.


707
0:38:4,35 --> 0:38:6,31
This was the
standard of the time.


708
0:38:6,31 --> 0:38:10,15
I suspect it was probably
not much different in Asia.


709
0:38:10,15 --> 0:38:13,74
I mean, unfortunately,
corporeal punishment


710
0:38:13,74 --> 0:38:16,62
or corporal punishment
was a standard.


711
0:38:16,62 --> 0:38:21,98
Now, I will hasten to say
that even during Serra's time,


712
0:38:21,98 --> 0:38:23,69
people took issue with it.


713
0:38:23,69 --> 0:38:25,85
One of the governor's
took issue with it.


714
0:38:25,85 --> 0:38:28,59
And he got into a big
argument with him in 1780.


715
0:38:28,59 --> 0:38:30,43
And I mention that.


716
0:38:30,43 --> 0:38:34,8
By the 1820s, it was abolished
throughout the Spanish lands.


717
0:38:34,8 --> 0:38:39,19
So although it was
the standard, it


718
0:38:39,19 --> 0:38:42,69
was beginning to
come under question.


719
0:38:42,69 --> 0:38:44,73
To move forward
to last obstacle--


720
0:38:44,73 --> 0:38:49,65
and then we'll open it
up-- the last obstacle


721
0:38:49,65 --> 0:38:53,225
was, in the words of Frank Buck,
how to bring him back alive.


722
0:38:53,225 --> 0:38:55,8



723
0:38:55,8 --> 0:39:0,21
Another way of stating this
is how to make the Serra story


724
0:39:0,21 --> 0:39:4,6
neither hagiography--
and hagiography,


725
0:39:4,6 --> 0:39:10,9
overly praising or
excessive adulation


726
0:39:10,9 --> 0:39:14,47
of the subject-- nor
a broadside attack.


727
0:39:14,47 --> 0:39:17,75
In short, how to make
Serra a real man.


728
0:39:17,75 --> 0:39:20,82
One way to do this
was to make those


729
0:39:20,82 --> 0:39:25,37
that he came to save for
Christ, real men and women, that


730
0:39:25,37 --> 0:39:27,0
is the Indians of California.


731
0:39:27,0 --> 0:39:30,68
So I had to do a lot of
research about Indian culture.


732
0:39:30,68 --> 0:39:32,69
As those of you have
written books know--


733
0:39:32,69 --> 0:39:36,46
or people who've organized
them, been involved


734
0:39:36,46 --> 0:39:40,8
with researching--
organization is theme.


735
0:39:40,8 --> 0:39:44,3
I tried to effect
a kind of ecumenism


736
0:39:44,3 --> 0:39:46,93
by dividing the first two
parts of the book like this.


737
0:39:46,93 --> 0:39:51,3
Part one is Serra
before California


738
0:39:51,3 --> 0:39:55,15
and part two is
California before Serra.


739
0:39:55,15 --> 0:39:57,8
Then we combine
them in part three.


740
0:39:57,8 --> 0:40:0,3
And then it's after his
death and the sainthood


741
0:40:0,3 --> 0:40:1,34
issue in part four.


742
0:40:1,34 --> 0:40:2,39
So it's pretty simple.


743
0:40:2,39 --> 0:40:7,88
But there was a
method to my madness.


744
0:40:7,88 --> 0:40:9,73
Another method of
bringing him back alive


745
0:40:9,73 --> 0:40:11,36
was to bring back
alive the women


746
0:40:11,36 --> 0:40:15,56
he loved, which included
the Blessed Mother


747
0:40:15,56 --> 0:40:20,86
herself, his sister and mother,
Maria Contreras in Oaxaca.


748
0:40:20,86 --> 0:40:24,61
That's the woman who
confessed to him, the affair.


749
0:40:24,61 --> 0:40:27,54
And Maria de Agreda-- has
anyone here ever heard


750
0:40:27,54 --> 0:40:31,65
of the 17th century
nun, Maria de Agreda?


751
0:40:31,65 --> 0:40:35,24
I had never heard of her
before I started the story.


752
0:40:35,24 --> 0:40:39,23
She was said to have
by bilocated 500 times


753
0:40:39,23 --> 0:40:43,269
from Spain, Agreda,
Spain, to New Mexico.


754
0:40:43,269 --> 0:40:44,81
And in the book, I
say, well, there's


755
0:40:44,81 --> 0:40:47,48
a spiritual frequent
flyer if there was one.


756
0:40:47,48 --> 0:40:50,12



757
0:40:50,12 --> 0:40:52,5
It's quite a story,
Maria de Agreda.


758
0:40:52,5 --> 0:40:55,84
But all this to say that
other than his Bible


759
0:40:55,84 --> 0:40:58,4
and his divine office,
the only other book


760
0:40:58,4 --> 0:41:2,7
that Serra had in his
bag all over California


761
0:41:2,7 --> 0:41:4,14
was "The Mystical
City of God" written


762
0:41:4,14 --> 0:41:8,17
by Maria de Agreda, a
four-volume novelistic


763
0:41:8,17 --> 0:41:10,58
treatment of the Blessed Mother.


764
0:41:10,58 --> 0:41:12,36
Anybody here interested
in women studies,


765
0:41:12,36 --> 0:41:14,3
take a look at that book.


766
0:41:14,3 --> 0:41:17,63
Not too many women novelists
in the 17th century.


767
0:41:17,63 --> 0:41:20,717
And here's one writing
four volumes about Mary.


768
0:41:20,717 --> 0:41:21,55
Serra was entranced.


769
0:41:21,55 --> 0:41:24,15



770
0:41:24,15 --> 0:41:27,11
Another way I tried to
bring him back alive


771
0:41:27,11 --> 0:41:31,7
was to use fictional
techniques about nonfiction.


772
0:41:31,7 --> 0:41:35,52
And that is, occasionally I
will put interior thoughts


773
0:41:35,52 --> 0:41:36,71
in italics.


774
0:41:36,71 --> 0:41:38,46
I try not to overdo it.


775
0:41:38,46 --> 0:41:42,49
I always ground it
in the real record.


776
0:41:42,49 --> 0:41:44,88
And when the record
runs out, I'll


777
0:41:44,88 --> 0:41:49,83
sometimes use the
subjunctive mood.


778
0:41:49,83 --> 0:41:52,83
And my editor said, oh,
yeah, the subjunctive


779
0:41:52,83 --> 0:41:55,34
will be the salve for the wound.


780
0:41:55,34 --> 0:41:58,9



781
0:41:58,9 --> 0:42:2,63
Beyond research for new
primary and secondary material


782
0:42:2,63 --> 0:42:4,35
and the somewhat
risky techniques


783
0:42:4,35 --> 0:42:6,35
was the matter of
walking in his shoes,


784
0:42:6,35 --> 0:42:9,26
in Mallorca, mainland
Spain, Mexico,


785
0:42:9,26 --> 0:42:10,93
and the two Californians.


786
0:42:10,93 --> 0:42:13,15
This was exhausting,
exhilarating,


787
0:42:13,15 --> 0:42:16,99
and for me at times
deeply humbling.


788
0:42:16,99 --> 0:42:19,91
The Serra story is
interdisciplinary from start


789
0:42:19,91 --> 0:42:20,49
to finish.


790
0:42:20,49 --> 0:42:23,49
You must steep yourself
in the art he loved,


791
0:42:23,49 --> 0:42:27,3
his theological models,
the history of the times,


792
0:42:27,3 --> 0:42:30,57
the history of the Church,
music, literature, geography,


793
0:42:30,57 --> 0:42:32,22
and the environment.


794
0:42:32,22 --> 0:42:35,18
And finally, I had a
field day envisioning


795
0:42:35,18 --> 0:42:39,26
the beauty of our wondrous state
through the eyes of one who


796
0:42:39,26 --> 0:42:42,67
fell in love with it for
life, causing great hope


797
0:42:42,67 --> 0:42:44,7
and great pain for
its inhabitants.


798
0:42:44,7 --> 0:42:47,59
And I'll leave you with
this short paragraph


799
0:42:47,59 --> 0:42:52,3
of Serra traveling south,
looking out on the water.


800
0:42:52,3 --> 0:42:54,53
Troubled before La
Assumpta-- La Assumpta


801
0:42:54,53 --> 0:42:58,34
is an Indian village near
present-day Ventura-- Serra


802
0:42:58,34 --> 0:43:2,59
saw something out on
the blue of the calm


803
0:43:2,59 --> 0:43:9,69
morning, a wound on the sea,
a lambent dark red, the kelp


804
0:43:9,69 --> 0:43:14,17
beds, like a stigmata
on the water.


805
0:43:14,17 --> 0:43:16,15
At the hottest
point of the sun, he


806
0:43:16,15 --> 0:43:20,75
might have climbed off the mule,
taken to the sea, the water


807
0:43:20,75 --> 0:43:24,36
making his robes heavy,
but his heart light.


808
0:43:24,36 --> 0:43:29,67
Close up, the kelp was golden,
its pods upright in the water.


809
0:43:29,67 --> 0:43:33,1
The kelp leaf could pass
over his face like a hand.


810
0:43:33,1 --> 0:43:37,26
God, he loved suffering
for this beauty.


811
0:43:37,26 --> 0:43:38,848
Thanks.


812
0:43:38,848 --> 0:43:44,84
[APPLAUSE]


813
0:43:44,84 --> 0:43:49,4
So a couple of quick images and
then we'll call it an evening.


814
0:43:49,4 --> 0:43:50,6
This is Mt.


815
0:43:50,6 --> 0:43:54,68
Ronda in Mallorca, a
beautiful upsurge of mountain.


816
0:43:54,68 --> 0:43:55,94
They're all over the island.


817
0:43:55,94 --> 0:43:59,78
And there are sanctuaries and
monks, monasteries up there.


818
0:43:59,78 --> 0:44:3,66
This is where one
of Serra's models,


819
0:44:3,66 --> 0:44:5,96
the 13th century
monk Raymond Lull,


820
0:44:5,96 --> 0:44:11,31
claimed to have seen a vision
of Christ crucified while he was


821
0:44:11,31 --> 0:44:13,46
living his dissolute
life, sort of like Saint


822
0:44:13,46 --> 0:44:15,81
Augustine in his 20s.


823
0:44:15,81 --> 0:44:18,83
Raymond Lull was writing a
letter to one of his lovers.


824
0:44:18,83 --> 0:44:21,75
And he saw this image of
Christ crucified on Mt.


825
0:44:21,75 --> 0:44:22,25
Ronda.


826
0:44:22,25 --> 0:44:25,3
And it was a place
that Serra loved.


827
0:44:25,3 --> 0:44:26,59
Here's Soller.


828
0:44:26,59 --> 0:44:30,33
Now, what does that remind
you of, that landscape?


829
0:44:30,33 --> 0:44:31,31
California.


830
0:44:31,31 --> 0:44:35,45
So I always say, Serra
left home to go home.


831
0:44:35,45 --> 0:44:36,2
It's beautiful.


832
0:44:36,2 --> 0:44:39,625
If you've never been to
Mallorca, you won't regret it.


833
0:44:39,625 --> 0:44:42,98
This is Soller, which is
where the olive press,


834
0:44:42,98 --> 0:44:44,55
the great olive press was.


835
0:44:44,55 --> 0:44:46,87
And Serra and his father
would take the olives


836
0:44:46,87 --> 0:44:50,4
on a mule train over the
mountain, the Tramuntana,


837
0:44:50,4 --> 0:44:52,92
down into Soller,
which was a port town,


838
0:44:52,92 --> 0:44:55,67
and put the olives
in the great grinder.


839
0:44:55,67 --> 0:44:58,15
There he is.


840
0:44:58,15 --> 0:45:4,2
Now, that's probably the only
painting he really sat for.


841
0:45:4,2 --> 0:45:6,99
But we're not even
sure that he did.


842
0:45:6,99 --> 0:45:10,22
But we guess around
1773, we think


843
0:45:10,22 --> 0:45:16,63
it was Jose de Paez, who
was a great Mexican painter.


844
0:45:16,63 --> 0:45:20,945
He looks a little
fraught, I'd say, puzzled.


845
0:45:20,945 --> 0:45:23,56



846
0:45:23,56 --> 0:45:27,77
The copy-- the original, if
it ever existed, is no more.


847
0:45:27,77 --> 0:45:30,62
This is one extant copy.


848
0:45:30,62 --> 0:45:32,94
And it's at Mission
Santa Barbara.


849
0:45:32,94 --> 0:45:35,51
So if you ever want to see
it, that's where it is.


850
0:45:35,51 --> 0:45:37,81
OK, the goodbye
letter to his parents.


851
0:45:37,81 --> 0:45:38,65
I flipped it.


852
0:45:38,65 --> 0:45:41,94
This is the fourth leaf.


853
0:45:41,94 --> 0:45:44,75
Remember, I was
talking about the spots


854
0:45:44,75 --> 0:45:46,5
on the goodbye letter?


855
0:45:46,5 --> 0:45:48,19
Let's see, can you see it here?


856
0:45:48,19 --> 0:45:51,819
There's one way up here
and then one down here.


857
0:45:51,819 --> 0:45:53,11
I don't know if you can see it.


858
0:45:53,11 --> 0:45:54,69
It's not quite focused.


859
0:45:54,69 --> 0:45:56,43
But it's there.


860
0:45:56,43 --> 0:46:0,15
Also take a look at how
he finished the letter.


861
0:46:0,15 --> 0:46:1,32
This is the actual letter.


862
0:46:1,32 --> 0:46:2,35
This is the margin.


863
0:46:2,35 --> 0:46:5,32
And on the side of
the leaf, he just


864
0:46:5,32 --> 0:46:7,57
couldn't stop saying goodbye.


865
0:46:7,57 --> 0:46:11,86
Goodbye to my-- please express
goodbye to my cousins, Jose.


866
0:46:11,86 --> 0:46:15,87
And please say goodbye to the
baker down the street in Petra.


867
0:46:15,87 --> 0:46:17,94
He just filled
this with goodbyes.


868
0:46:17,94 --> 0:46:20,93
It's obviously a
very painful letter.


869
0:46:20,93 --> 0:46:22,8
And then he ends
it, cordial amigo


870
0:46:22,8 --> 0:46:25,96
in Cristo, your cordial
friend in Christ,


871
0:46:25,96 --> 0:46:30,45
Junipero Serra, Junipero
Serra, indigno sacerdote,


872
0:46:30,45 --> 0:46:33,28
which in Latin is
"unworthy priest."


873
0:46:33,28 --> 0:46:35,44
But look at this.


874
0:46:35,44 --> 0:46:37,83
There's a little squiggle here.


875
0:46:37,83 --> 0:46:40,38
And I think-- and
you wouldn't see


876
0:46:40,38 --> 0:46:45,0
unless you saw the original--
that he added a superlative.


877
0:46:45,0 --> 0:46:46,16
It's not "indigno."


878
0:46:46,16 --> 0:46:51,84
It's "indignisimo," which
means "most unworthy priest."


879
0:46:51,84 --> 0:46:56,194
All right, here's
North America in 1663.


880
0:46:56,194 --> 0:46:56,985
You see California?


881
0:46:56,985 --> 0:47:1,51



882
0:47:1,51 --> 0:47:3,67
It's this huge island.


883
0:47:3,67 --> 0:47:7,37
And that's what California
was taken as for a long time.


884
0:47:7,37 --> 0:47:9,5
Into the middle of
the 18th century,


885
0:47:9,5 --> 0:47:11,67
California was thought
to be an island.


886
0:47:11,67 --> 0:47:15,31
And in this case, it's half the
size of the continental United


887
0:47:15,31 --> 0:47:16,4
States.


888
0:47:16,4 --> 0:47:18,56
This is "The Founding"
in Monterrey--


889
0:47:18,56 --> 0:47:21,97
the great painting
called "The Founding."


890
0:47:21,97 --> 0:47:28,98
The painting is 1877, but the
event was 1700-- 1770, sorry,


891
0:47:28,98 --> 0:47:32,13
the second mission.


892
0:47:32,13 --> 0:47:33,68
This is the Vizcaino.


893
0:47:33,68 --> 0:47:35,8
It's no longer there today.


894
0:47:35,8 --> 0:47:38,63
But there was an earlier
mass done in 1602


895
0:47:38,63 --> 0:47:41,5
by the explorer
Sebastian Vizcaino.


896
0:47:41,5 --> 0:47:44,51
And in it lasted for many
years, until it finally


897
0:47:44,51 --> 0:47:46,69
rotted and was thrown
into the bay when


898
0:47:46,69 --> 0:47:52,9
they were building a
train, in about 1905.


899
0:47:52,9 --> 0:47:55,68
Probably one of the more famous
trees in American history.


900
0:47:55,68 --> 0:47:57,77
I mentioned Maria de Agreda.


901
0:47:57,77 --> 0:48:2,1
This is a picture of her I
got from Zacatecas in Mexico.


902
0:48:2,1 --> 0:48:3,66
Here's Maria.


903
0:48:3,66 --> 0:48:6,61
And she's sitting next to
one of the evangelists.


904
0:48:6,61 --> 0:48:10,455
Can you guess which one,
the four gospel writers?


905
0:48:10,455 --> 0:48:12,56
It's John, Saint John.


906
0:48:12,56 --> 0:48:16,7
And they each are
wielding a pen-- writers.


907
0:48:16,7 --> 0:48:21,94
And this is the name of
her great book on Mary.


908
0:48:21,94 --> 0:48:24,13
I mentioned to you the
last night of his life


909
0:48:24,13 --> 0:48:27,99
was-- great fear
had come over him.


910
0:48:27,99 --> 0:48:29,51
This is the great fear painting.


911
0:48:29,51 --> 0:48:32,3



912
0:48:32,3 --> 0:48:35,95
If there was any doubt that's
what he had said-- very soon,


913
0:48:35,95 --> 0:48:37,7
he died in 1784.


914
0:48:37,7 --> 0:48:41,22
So six years later, there's
a painting about this moment.


915
0:48:41,22 --> 0:48:43,21
It was legendary even then.


916
0:48:43,21 --> 0:48:44,96
And it would have to
have been transferred


917
0:48:44,96 --> 0:48:48,78
by his very close friend and
first biographer, Francisco


918
0:48:48,78 --> 0:48:50,56
Palou.


919
0:48:50,56 --> 0:48:51,18
Here's Serra in the middle.


920
0:48:51,18 --> 0:48:54,16
This is Palou himself,
doing last rites.


921
0:48:54,16 --> 0:48:54,84
Can you see?


922
0:48:54,84 --> 0:48:57,14
It's not easy to see it.


923
0:48:57,14 --> 0:48:59,4
Maybe over here, more easy.


924
0:48:59,4 --> 0:49:1,68
There's a face above Palou.


925
0:49:1,68 --> 0:49:3,475
Can you see it?


926
0:49:3,475 --> 0:49:6,36
It's very difficult to see
on this project-- that's


927
0:49:6,36 --> 0:49:9,5
an Indian, Indian chief.


928
0:49:9,5 --> 0:49:13,61
And on the left is probably
Governor Pedro Fagus,


929
0:49:13,61 --> 0:49:17,21
who clashed with
Serra constantly.


930
0:49:17,21 --> 0:49:18,36
I love this painting.


931
0:49:18,36 --> 0:49:21,66
It's shown in Carmel
Mission once a year,


932
0:49:21,66 --> 0:49:23,23
for the week before Christmas.


933
0:49:23,23 --> 0:49:28,0
And it's Mary being visited
by St. Elizabeth, who's


934
0:49:28,0 --> 0:49:29,54
pregnant with John the Baptist.


935
0:49:29,54 --> 0:49:32,93
And Mary, of course, is
pregnant with Christ.


936
0:49:32,93 --> 0:49:35,13
The painting was
done around 1500.


937
0:49:35,13 --> 0:49:40,7
And it is in the Uffizi in
Florence, the great Uffizi


938
0:49:40,7 --> 0:49:40,87
gallery.


939
0:49:40,87 --> 0:49:42,4
This is a copy.


940
0:49:42,4 --> 0:49:46,89
And the copy-- a very good
one-- is in Carmel Mission.


941
0:49:46,89 --> 0:49:50,1
Oh god, forget him.


942
0:49:50,1 --> 0:49:51,75
I'm out the childhood window.


943
0:49:51,75 --> 0:49:53,76
And the last picture
will make my wife--


944
0:49:53,76 --> 0:49:59,39
she's in the backyard of
Serra's home in Petra, looking


945
0:49:59,39 --> 0:50:2,88
a little-- oh, Greg,
isn't it time to go?


946
0:50:2,88 --> 0:50:4,29
Well, thank you.


947
0:50:4,29 --> 0:52:4,29
[APPLAUSE]
