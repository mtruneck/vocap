1
0:0:0,834 --> 0:0:3,633
The President:
Please, everybody have a seat.


2
0:0:3,633 --> 0:0:10,6
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice
President, members of Congress,


3
0:0:10,6 --> 0:0:16,967
fellow Americans: Fifty-one
years ago, John F. Kennedy


4
0:0:16,967 --> 0:0:22,667
declared to this chamber that
"the Constitution makes us not


5
0:0:22,667 --> 0:0:27,1
"rivals for power but
partners for progress."


6
0:0:27,1 --> 0:0:34,3
(applause)


7
0:0:34,3 --> 0:0:40,834
"It is my task," he said, "to
report the State of the Union --


8
0:0:40,834 --> 0:0:46,0
"to improve it is
the task of us all."


9
0:0:46,0 --> 0:0:50,0
Tonight, thanks to the grit and
determination of the American


10
0:0:50,0 --> 0:0:55,6
people, there is much
progress to report.


11
0:0:55,6 --> 0:0:59,667
After a decade of grinding
war, our brave men and women in


12
0:0:59,667 --> 0:1:2,0
uniform are coming home.


13
0:1:2,0 --> 0:1:22,467
(applause)


14
0:1:22,467 --> 0:1:25,867
After years of
grueling recession,


15
0:1:25,867 --> 0:1:30,8
our businesses have created
over six million new jobs.


16
0:1:30,8 --> 0:1:34,333
We buy more American cars
than we have in five years,


17
0:1:34,333 --> 0:1:37,834
and less foreign oil
than we have in 20.


18
0:1:37,834 --> 0:1:43,367
(applause)


19
0:1:43,367 --> 0:1:48,4
Our housing market is healing,
our stock market is rebounding,


20
0:1:48,4 --> 0:1:52,3
and consumers, patients, and
homeowners enjoy stronger


21
0:1:52,3 --> 0:1:54,8
protections than ever before.


22
0:1:54,8 --> 0:1:58,8
(applause)


23
0:1:58,8 --> 0:2:5,4
So, together, we have cleared
away the rubble of crisis,


24
0:2:5,4 --> 0:2:9,633
and we can say with renewed
confidence that the State of our


25
0:2:9,633 --> 0:2:11,367
Union is stronger.


26
0:2:11,367 --> 0:2:24,8
(applause)


27
0:2:24,8 --> 0:2:30,467
But we gather here knowing that
there are millions of Americans


28
0:2:30,467 --> 0:2:35,233
whose hard work and dedication
have not yet been rewarded.


29
0:2:35,233 --> 0:2:38,6
Our economy is adding jobs --
but too many people still can't


30
0:2:38,6 --> 0:2:41,367
find full-time employment.


31
0:2:41,367 --> 0:2:45,767
Corporate profits have
skyrocketed to all-time highs --


32
0:2:45,767 --> 0:2:48,734
but for more than a decade,
wages and incomes have


33
0:2:48,734 --> 0:2:51,5
barely budged.


34
0:2:51,5 --> 0:2:54,266
It is our generation's
task, then,


35
0:2:54,266 --> 0:2:58,367
to reignite the true engine of
America's economic growth --


36
0:2:58,367 --> 0:3:0,9
a rising, thriving middle class.


37
0:3:0,9 --> 0:3:14,367
(applause)


38
0:3:14,367 --> 0:3:18,734
It is our unfinished task to
restore the basic bargain that


39
0:3:18,734 --> 0:3:22,734
built this country -- the idea
that if you work hard and meet


40
0:3:22,734 --> 0:3:25,967
your responsibilities,
you can get ahead,


41
0:3:25,967 --> 0:3:28,834
no matter where you come from,
no matter what you look like,


42
0:3:28,834 --> 0:3:31,5
or who you love.


43
0:3:31,5 --> 0:3:34,834
It is our unfinished task to
make sure that this government


44
0:3:34,834 --> 0:3:37,9
works on behalf of the
many, and not just the few;


45
0:3:37,9 --> 0:3:41,266
that it encourages
free enterprise,


46
0:3:41,266 --> 0:3:45,4
rewards individual initiative,
and opens the doors of


47
0:3:45,4 --> 0:3:48,934
opportunity to every child
across this great nation.


48
0:3:48,934 --> 0:3:56,4
(applause)


49
0:3:56,4 --> 0:3:59,734
The American people don't
expect government to solve


50
0:3:59,734 --> 0:4:2,3
every problem.


51
0:4:2,3 --> 0:4:5,33
They don't expect those of us
in this chamber to agree on


52
0:4:5,33 --> 0:4:7,233
every issue.


53
0:4:7,233 --> 0:4:11,9
But they do expect us to put the
nation's interests before party.


54
0:4:11,9 --> 0:4:32,6
(applause)


55
0:4:32,6 --> 0:4:35,4
They do expect us to forge
reasonable compromise


56
0:4:35,4 --> 0:4:37,5
where we can.


57
0:4:37,5 --> 0:4:40,8
For they know that America
moves forward only when we do so


58
0:4:40,8 --> 0:4:44,4
together, and that the
responsibility of improving this


59
0:4:44,4 --> 0:4:49,834
union remains the
task of us all.


60
0:4:49,834 --> 0:4:53,533
Our work must begin by making
some basic decisions about our


61
0:4:53,533 --> 0:4:57,1
budget -- decisions that will
have a huge impact on the


62
0:4:57,1 --> 0:5:0,7
strength of our recovery.


63
0:5:0,7 --> 0:5:3,834
Over the last few years, both
parties have worked together to


64
0:5:3,834 --> 0:5:7,6
reduce the deficit by
more than $2.5 trillion --


65
0:5:7,6 --> 0:5:12,734
mostly through spending cuts,
but also by raising tax rates on


66
0:5:12,734 --> 0:5:16,734
the wealthiest 1% of Americans.


67
0:5:16,734 --> 0:5:20,767
As a result, we are more than
halfway towards the goal of


68
0:5:20,767 --> 0:5:24,233
$4 trillion in deficit reduction
that economists say we need to


69
0:5:24,233 --> 0:5:27,633
stabilize our finances.


70
0:5:27,633 --> 0:5:30,233
Now we need to finish the job.


71
0:5:30,233 --> 0:5:33,667
And the question is, how?


72
0:5:33,667 --> 0:5:37,767
In 2011, Congress passed a law
saying that if both parties


73
0:5:37,767 --> 0:5:41,533
couldn't agree on a plan
to reach our deficit goal,


74
0:5:41,533 --> 0:5:44,66
about a trillion dollars'
worth of budget cuts would


75
0:5:44,66 --> 0:5:48,6
automatically go into
effect this year.


76
0:5:48,6 --> 0:5:53,834
These sudden, harsh, arbitrary
cuts would jeopardize our


77
0:5:53,834 --> 0:5:56,233
military readiness.


78
0:5:56,233 --> 0:5:59,333
They'd devastate priorities
like education, and energy,


79
0:5:59,333 --> 0:6:2,1
and medical research.


80
0:6:2,1 --> 0:6:5,4
They would certainly
slow our recovery,


81
0:6:5,4 --> 0:6:9,33
and cost us hundreds
of thousands of jobs.


82
0:6:9,33 --> 0:6:12,1
That's why Democrats,
Republicans, business leaders,


83
0:6:12,1 --> 0:6:15,5
and economists have already
said that these cuts,


84
0:6:15,5 --> 0:6:18,867
known here in Washington
as the sequester,


85
0:6:18,867 --> 0:6:22,734
are a really bad idea.


86
0:6:22,734 --> 0:6:27,7
Now, some in Congress have
proposed preventing only the


87
0:6:27,7 --> 0:6:31,934
defense cuts by making even
bigger cuts to things like


88
0:6:31,934 --> 0:6:35,967
education and job training,
Medicare and Social


89
0:6:35,967 --> 0:6:38,867
Security benefits.


90
0:6:38,867 --> 0:6:40,7
That idea is even worse.


91
0:6:40,7 --> 0:6:57,3
(applause)


92
0:6:57,3 --> 0:7:1,533
Yes, the biggest driver of our
long-term debt is the rising


93
0:7:1,533 --> 0:7:4,834
cost of health care for
an aging population.


94
0:7:4,834 --> 0:7:8,367
And those of us who care deeply
about programs like Medicare


95
0:7:8,367 --> 0:7:11,734
must embrace the need
for modest reforms --


96
0:7:11,734 --> 0:7:15,367
otherwise, our retirement
programs will crowd out the


97
0:7:15,367 --> 0:7:17,7
investments we need
for our children,


98
0:7:17,7 --> 0:7:20,433
and jeopardize the promise
of a secure retirement for


99
0:7:20,433 --> 0:7:21,5
future generations.


100
0:7:21,5 --> 0:7:26,9
But we can't ask senior citizens
and working families to shoulder


101
0:7:26,9 --> 0:7:30,4
the entire burden of deficit
reduction while asking nothing


102
0:7:30,4 --> 0:7:32,6
more from the wealthiest
and the most powerful.


103
0:7:32,6 --> 0:7:39,3
(applause)


104
0:7:39,3 --> 0:7:41,834
We won't grow the middle class
simply by shifting the cost of


105
0:7:41,834 --> 0:7:44,367
health care or college onto
families that are already


106
0:7:44,367 --> 0:7:47,867
struggling, or by forcing
communities to lay off more


107
0:7:47,867 --> 0:7:51,967
teachers and more cops
and more firefighters.


108
0:7:51,967 --> 0:7:56,633
Most Americans -- Democrats,
Republicans, and independents --


109
0:7:56,633 --> 0:8:1,166
understand that we can't just
cut our way to prosperity.


110
0:8:1,166 --> 0:8:4,33
They know that broad-based
economic growth requires a


111
0:8:4,33 --> 0:8:6,7
balanced approach to
deficit reduction,


112
0:8:6,7 --> 0:8:11,0
with spending cuts and revenue,
and with everybody doing


113
0:8:11,0 --> 0:8:13,3
their fair share.


114
0:8:13,3 --> 0:8:17,166
And that's the approach
I offer tonight.


115
0:8:17,166 --> 0:8:20,33
On Medicare, I'm prepared to
enact reforms that will achieve


116
0:8:20,33 --> 0:8:23,33
the same amount of health care
savings by the beginning of the


117
0:8:23,33 --> 0:8:26,233
next decade as the reforms
proposed by the bipartisan


118
0:8:26,233 --> 0:8:27,6
Simpson-Bowles commission.


119
0:8:27,6 --> 0:8:31,5
(applause)


120
0:8:31,5 --> 0:8:34,734
Already, the Affordable Care Act
is helping to slow the growth of


121
0:8:34,734 --> 0:8:36,0
health care costs.


122
0:8:36,0 --> 0:8:40,66
(applause)


123
0:8:40,66 --> 0:8:43,567
And the reforms I'm
proposing go even further.


124
0:8:43,567 --> 0:8:47,0
We'll reduce taxpayer subsidies
to prescription drug companies


125
0:8:47,0 --> 0:8:49,2
and ask more from the
wealthiest seniors.


126
0:8:49,2 --> 0:8:50,367
(applause)


127
0:8:50,367 --> 0:8:54,66
We'll bring down costs by
changing the way our government


128
0:8:54,66 --> 0:8:56,834
pays for Medicare, because our
medical bills shouldn't be based


129
0:8:56,834 --> 0:9:0,7
on the number of tests ordered
or days spent in the hospital;


130
0:9:0,7 --> 0:9:2,433
they should be based on the
quality of care that our


131
0:9:2,433 --> 0:9:3,6
seniors receive.


132
0:9:3,6 --> 0:9:12,6
(applause)


133
0:9:12,6 --> 0:9:16,767
And I am open to additional
reforms from both parties,


134
0:9:16,767 --> 0:9:19,133
so long as they don't
violate the guarantee of a


135
0:9:19,133 --> 0:9:21,3
secure retirement.


136
0:9:21,3 --> 0:9:24,7
Our government shouldn't make
promises we cannot keep --


137
0:9:24,7 --> 0:9:27,667
but we must keep the
promises we've already made.


138
0:9:27,667 --> 0:9:44,734
(applause)


139
0:9:44,734 --> 0:9:48,133
To hit the rest of our
deficit reduction target,


140
0:9:48,133 --> 0:9:50,8
we should do what leaders
in both parties have already


141
0:9:50,8 --> 0:9:55,433
suggested, and save hundreds of
billions of dollars by getting


142
0:9:55,433 --> 0:9:57,867
rid of tax loopholes and
deductions for the well-off and


143
0:9:57,867 --> 0:10:0,66
the well-connected.


144
0:10:0,66 --> 0:10:4,233
After all, why would we choose
to make deeper cuts to education


145
0:10:4,233 --> 0:10:9,133
and Medicare just to protect
special interest tax breaks?


146
0:10:9,133 --> 0:10:11,5
How is that fair?


147
0:10:11,5 --> 0:10:16,7
Why is it that deficit reduction
is a big emergency justifying


148
0:10:16,7 --> 0:10:19,934
making cuts in Social Security
benefits but not closing


149
0:10:19,934 --> 0:10:21,9
some loopholes?


150
0:10:21,9 --> 0:10:23,433
How does that promote growth?


151
0:10:23,433 --> 0:10:27,767
(applause)


152
0:10:27,767 --> 0:10:31,633
Now is our best
chance for bipartisan,


153
0:10:31,633 --> 0:10:35,9
comprehensive tax reform that
encourages job creation and


154
0:10:35,9 --> 0:10:37,367
helps bring down the deficit.


155
0:10:37,367 --> 0:10:42,166
(applause)


156
0:10:42,166 --> 0:10:51,633
We can get this done.


157
0:10:51,633 --> 0:10:54,33
The American people deserve
a tax code that helps small


158
0:10:54,33 --> 0:10:57,533
businesses spend less time
filling out complicated forms,


159
0:10:57,533 --> 0:11:0,533
and more time
expanding and hiring --


160
0:11:0,533 --> 0:11:2,667
a tax code that ensures
billionaires with high-powered


161
0:11:2,667 --> 0:11:5,367
accountants can't work the
system and pay a lower rate than


162
0:11:5,367 --> 0:11:9,433
their hardworking secretaries; a
tax code that lowers incentives


163
0:11:9,433 --> 0:11:13,2
to move jobs overseas, and
lowers tax rates for businesses


164
0:11:13,2 --> 0:11:16,133
and manufacturers that are
creating jobs right here in the


165
0:11:16,133 --> 0:11:17,834
United States of America.


166
0:11:17,834 --> 0:11:20,133
That's what tax
reform can deliver.


167
0:11:20,133 --> 0:11:21,567
That's what we can do together.


168
0:11:21,567 --> 0:11:31,3
(applause)


169
0:11:31,3 --> 0:11:35,567
I realize that tax reform
and entitlement reform will


170
0:11:35,567 --> 0:11:38,467
not be easy.


171
0:11:38,467 --> 0:11:42,133
The politics will be
hard for both sides.


172
0:11:42,133 --> 0:11:46,667
None of us will get
100% of what we want.


173
0:11:46,667 --> 0:11:51,734
But the alternative will cost
us jobs, hurt our economy,


174
0:11:51,734 --> 0:11:56,667
visit hardship on millions
of hardworking Americans.


175
0:11:56,667 --> 0:12:0,467
So let's set party interests
aside and work to pass a budget


176
0:12:0,467 --> 0:12:4,467
that replaces reckless cuts
with smart savings and wise


177
0:12:4,467 --> 0:12:6,133
investments in our future.


178
0:12:6,133 --> 0:12:8,667
And let's do it without the
brinksmanship that stresses


179
0:12:8,667 --> 0:12:11,233
consumers and scares
off investors.


180
0:12:11,233 --> 0:12:16,133
(applause)


181
0:12:16,133 --> 0:12:18,3
The greatest nation on Earth
cannot keep conducting its


182
0:12:18,3 --> 0:12:21,834
business by drifting from one
manufactured crisis to the next.


183
0:12:21,834 --> 0:12:23,266
(applause)


184
0:12:23,266 --> 0:12:24,367
We can't do it.


185
0:12:24,367 --> 0:12:31,867
(applause)


186
0:12:31,867 --> 0:12:36,7
Let's agree right here, right
now to keep the people's


187
0:12:36,7 --> 0:12:39,567
government open, and
pay our bills on time,


188
0:12:39,567 --> 0:12:43,166
and always uphold the full faith
and credit of the United States


189
0:12:43,166 --> 0:12:44,166
of America.


190
0:12:44,166 --> 0:12:55,5
(applause)


191
0:12:55,5 --> 0:12:58,734
The American people have
worked too hard, for too long,


192
0:12:58,734 --> 0:13:2,66
rebuilding from one crisis to
see their elected officials


193
0:13:2,66 --> 0:13:3,4
cause another.


194
0:13:3,4 --> 0:13:5,7
(applause)


195
0:13:5,7 --> 0:13:11,834
Now, most of us agree that a
plan to reduce the deficit must


196
0:13:11,834 --> 0:13:13,467
be part of our agenda.


197
0:13:13,467 --> 0:13:19,834
But let's be clear, deficit
reduction alone is not an


198
0:13:19,834 --> 0:13:21,66
economic plan.


199
0:13:21,66 --> 0:13:25,9
(applause)


200
0:13:25,9 --> 0:13:29,533
A growing economy that creates
good, middle-class jobs --


201
0:13:29,533 --> 0:13:32,467
that must be the North Star
that guides our efforts.


202
0:13:32,467 --> 0:13:40,1
(applause)


203
0:13:40,1 --> 0:13:43,166
Every day, we should ask
ourselves three questions as a


204
0:13:43,166 --> 0:13:47,767
nation: How do we attract
more jobs to our shores?


205
0:13:47,767 --> 0:13:50,7
How do we equip our people
with the skills they need to


206
0:13:50,7 --> 0:13:52,734
get those jobs?


207
0:13:52,734 --> 0:13:55,467
And how do we make sure
that hard work leads to a


208
0:13:55,467 --> 0:13:58,133
decent living?


209
0:13:58,133 --> 0:14:1,233
A year and a half ago, I put
forward an American Jobs Act


210
0:14:1,233 --> 0:14:3,367
that independent economists
said would create more than


211
0:14:3,367 --> 0:14:4,567
1 million new jobs.


212
0:14:4,567 --> 0:14:9,233
And I thank the last Congress
for passing some of that agenda.


213
0:14:9,233 --> 0:14:12,734
I urge this Congress
to pass the rest.


214
0:14:12,734 --> 0:14:13,734
(applause)


215
0:14:13,734 --> 0:14:17,1
But tonight, I'll lay out
additional proposals that are


216
0:14:17,1 --> 0:14:21,133
fully paid for and fully
consistent with the budget


217
0:14:21,133 --> 0:14:25,133
framework both parties
agreed to just 18 months ago.


218
0:14:25,133 --> 0:14:30,133
Let me repeat -- nothing
I'm proposing tonight should


219
0:14:30,133 --> 0:14:32,934
increase our deficit
by a single dime.


220
0:14:32,934 --> 0:14:35,4
It is not a bigger
government we need,


221
0:14:35,4 --> 0:14:39,133
but a smarter government that
sets priorities and invests in


222
0:14:39,133 --> 0:14:40,333
broad-based growth.


223
0:14:40,333 --> 0:14:43,467
(applause)


224
0:14:43,467 --> 0:14:44,8
That's what we should
be looking for.


225
0:14:44,8 --> 0:14:54,934
(applause)


226
0:14:54,934 --> 0:14:58,633
Our first priority is making
America a magnet for new jobs


227
0:14:58,633 --> 0:15:0,567
and manufacturing.


228
0:15:0,567 --> 0:15:3,2
After shedding jobs
for more than 10 years,


229
0:15:3,2 --> 0:15:6,467
our manufacturers have
added about 500,000 jobs over


230
0:15:6,467 --> 0:15:8,333
the past three.


231
0:15:8,333 --> 0:15:11,633
Caterpillar is bringing
jobs back from Japan.


232
0:15:11,633 --> 0:15:14,233
Ford is bringing jobs
back from Mexico.


233
0:15:14,233 --> 0:15:17,767
And this year, Apple will start
making Macs in America again.


234
0:15:17,767 --> 0:15:23,367
(applause)


235
0:15:23,367 --> 0:15:25,9
There are things we
can do, right now,


236
0:15:25,9 --> 0:15:28,3
to accelerate this trend.


237
0:15:28,3 --> 0:15:31,367
Last year, we created our
first manufacturing innovation


238
0:15:31,367 --> 0:15:32,934
institute in Youngstown, Ohio.


239
0:15:32,934 --> 0:15:37,567
A once-shuttered warehouse is
now a state-of-the art lab where


240
0:15:37,567 --> 0:15:40,6
new workers are mastering the 3D
printing that has the potential


241
0:15:40,6 --> 0:15:44,2
to revolutionize the way
we make almost everything.


242
0:15:44,2 --> 0:15:47,8
There's no reason this
can't happen in other towns.


243
0:15:47,8 --> 0:15:50,734
So tonight, I'm announcing the
launch of three more of these


244
0:15:50,734 --> 0:15:53,433
manufacturing hubs, where
businesses will partner with the


245
0:15:53,433 --> 0:15:57,33
Department of Defense and Energy
to turn regions left behind by


246
0:15:57,33 --> 0:16:1,333
globalization into global
centers of high-tech jobs.


247
0:16:1,333 --> 0:16:5,166
And I ask this Congress to help
create a network of 15 of these


248
0:16:5,166 --> 0:16:8,867
hubs and guarantee that the next
revolution in manufacturing is


249
0:16:8,867 --> 0:16:10,967
made right here in America.


250
0:16:10,967 --> 0:16:12,266
We can get that done.


251
0:16:12,266 --> 0:16:26,166
(applause)


252
0:16:26,166 --> 0:16:28,767
Now, if we want to
make the best products,


253
0:16:28,767 --> 0:16:33,433
we also have to invest
in the best ideas.


254
0:16:33,433 --> 0:16:39,133
Every dollar we invested to map
the human genome returned $140


255
0:16:39,133 --> 0:16:42,6
to our economy -- every dollar.


256
0:16:42,6 --> 0:16:45,567
Today, our scientists are
mapping the human brain to


257
0:16:45,567 --> 0:16:48,4
unlock the answers
to Alzheimer's.


258
0:16:48,4 --> 0:16:52,4
They're developing drugs to
regenerate damaged organs;


259
0:16:52,4 --> 0:16:55,3
devising new material to
make batteries 10 times


260
0:16:55,3 --> 0:16:57,333
more powerful.


261
0:16:57,333 --> 0:17:0,667
Now is not the time to gut these
job-creating investments in


262
0:17:0,667 --> 0:17:2,1
science and innovation.


263
0:17:2,1 --> 0:17:6,367
Now is the time to reach a level
of research and development not


264
0:17:6,367 --> 0:17:8,533
seen since the height
of the Space Race.


265
0:17:8,533 --> 0:17:10,2
We need to make
those investments.


266
0:17:10,2 --> 0:17:20,5
(applause)


267
0:17:20,5 --> 0:17:23,967
Today, no area holds more
promise than our investments in


268
0:17:23,967 --> 0:17:26,867
American energy.


269
0:17:26,867 --> 0:17:31,467
After years of talking about it,
we're finally poised to control


270
0:17:31,467 --> 0:17:33,967
our own energy future.


271
0:17:33,967 --> 0:17:36,834
We produce more oil at home
than we have in 15 years.


272
0:17:36,834 --> 0:17:38,3
(applause)


273
0:17:38,3 --> 0:17:42,8
We have doubled the distance our
cars will go on a gallon of gas,


274
0:17:42,8 --> 0:17:45,467
and the amount of renewable
energy we generate from sources


275
0:17:45,467 --> 0:17:48,467
like wind and solar -- with tens
of thousands of good American


276
0:17:48,467 --> 0:17:50,967
jobs to show for it.


277
0:17:50,967 --> 0:17:54,333
We produce more natural
gas than ever before --


278
0:17:54,333 --> 0:17:57,734
and nearly everyone's energy
bill is lower because of it.


279
0:17:57,734 --> 0:18:1,567
And over the last four years,
our emissions of the dangerous


280
0:18:1,567 --> 0:18:7,867
carbon pollution that threatens
our planet have actually fallen.


281
0:18:7,867 --> 0:18:11,2
But for the sake of our
children and our future,


282
0:18:11,2 --> 0:18:14,233
we must do more to
combat climate change.


283
0:18:14,233 --> 0:18:28,633
(applause)


284
0:18:28,633 --> 0:18:34,667
Now, it's true that no
single event makes a trend.


285
0:18:34,667 --> 0:18:39,8
But the fact is the 12 hottest
years on record have all come in


286
0:18:39,8 --> 0:18:42,734
the last 15.


287
0:18:42,734 --> 0:18:48,467
Heat waves, droughts,
wildfires, floods --


288
0:18:48,467 --> 0:18:52,934
all are now more frequent
and more intense.


289
0:18:52,934 --> 0:18:56,233
We can choose to believe
that Superstorm Sandy,


290
0:18:56,233 --> 0:18:58,767
and the most severe
drought in decades,


291
0:18:58,767 --> 0:19:1,633
and the worst wildfires some
states have ever seen were all


292
0:19:1,633 --> 0:19:4,867
just a freak coincidence.


293
0:19:4,867 --> 0:19:7,934
Or we can choose to believe in
the overwhelming judgment of


294
0:19:7,934 --> 0:19:10,533
science -- and act
before it's too late.


295
0:19:10,533 --> 0:19:18,9
(applause)


296
0:19:18,9 --> 0:19:21,533
Now, the good news is we can
make meaningful progress on this


297
0:19:21,533 --> 0:19:25,433
issue while driving
strong economic growth.


298
0:19:25,433 --> 0:19:28,4
I urge this Congress to get
together, pursue a bipartisan,


299
0:19:28,4 --> 0:19:30,767
market-based solution
to climate change,


300
0:19:30,767 --> 0:19:33,233
like the one John McCain and Joe
Lieberman worked on together a


301
0:19:33,233 --> 0:19:35,567
few years ago.


302
0:19:35,567 --> 0:19:40,3
But if Congress won't act soon
to protect future generations,


303
0:19:40,3 --> 0:19:41,533
I will.


304
0:19:41,533 --> 0:19:45,5
(applause)


305
0:19:45,5 --> 0:19:48,633
I will direct my Cabinet to come
up with executive actions we can


306
0:19:48,633 --> 0:19:51,967
take, now and in the
future, to reduce pollution,


307
0:19:51,967 --> 0:19:55,433
prepare our communities for the
consequences of climate change,


308
0:19:55,433 --> 0:20:0,667
and speed the transition to more
sustainable sources of energy.


309
0:20:0,667 --> 0:20:3,233
Four years ago, other countries
dominated the clean energy


310
0:20:3,233 --> 0:20:5,533
market and the jobs
that came with it.


311
0:20:5,533 --> 0:20:8,433
And we've begun to change that.


312
0:20:8,433 --> 0:20:11,767
Last year, wind energy added
nearly half of all new power


313
0:20:11,767 --> 0:20:13,266
capacity in America.


314
0:20:13,266 --> 0:20:16,33
So let's generate even more.


315
0:20:16,33 --> 0:20:17,934
Solar energy gets
cheaper by the year --


316
0:20:17,934 --> 0:20:21,166
let's drive down
costs even further.


317
0:20:21,166 --> 0:20:23,967
As long as countries like China
keep going all in on clean


318
0:20:23,967 --> 0:20:26,667
energy, so must we.


319
0:20:26,667 --> 0:20:30,66
Now, in the meantime, the
natural gas boom has led to


320
0:20:30,66 --> 0:20:33,0
cleaner power and greater
energy independence.


321
0:20:33,0 --> 0:20:34,667
We need to encourage that.


322
0:20:34,667 --> 0:20:37,633
And that's why my administration
will keep cutting red tape and


323
0:20:37,633 --> 0:20:40,367
speeding up new oil
and gas permits.


324
0:20:40,367 --> 0:20:41,734
(applause)


325
0:20:41,734 --> 0:20:44,567
That's got to be part of
an all-of-the-above plan.


326
0:20:44,567 --> 0:20:47,266
But I also want to work with
this Congress to encourage the


327
0:20:47,266 --> 0:20:50,9
research and technology that
helps natural gas burn even


328
0:20:50,9 --> 0:20:55,967
cleaner and protects
our air and our water.


329
0:20:55,967 --> 0:20:58,767
In fact, much of our new-found
energy is drawn from lands and


330
0:20:58,767 --> 0:21:3,166
waters that we, the
public, own together.


331
0:21:3,166 --> 0:21:5,8
So tonight, I propose we use
some of our oil and gas revenues


332
0:21:5,8 --> 0:21:9,3
to fund an Energy Security Trust
that will drive new research and


333
0:21:9,3 --> 0:21:14,767
technology to shift our cars
and trucks off oil for good.


334
0:21:14,767 --> 0:21:17,767
If a nonpartisan coalition of
CEOs and retired generals and


335
0:21:17,767 --> 0:21:21,667
admirals can get behind
this idea, then so can we.


336
0:21:21,667 --> 0:21:25,1
Let's take their advice and free
our families and businesses from


337
0:21:25,1 --> 0:21:28,7
the painful spikes in gas
prices we've put up with for


338
0:21:28,7 --> 0:21:31,133
far too long.


339
0:21:31,133 --> 0:21:33,66
I'm also issuing a
new goal for America:


340
0:21:33,66 --> 0:21:36,533
Let's cut in half the energy
wasted by our homes and


341
0:21:36,533 --> 0:21:38,166
businesses over
the next 20 years.


342
0:21:38,166 --> 0:21:46,33
(applause)


343
0:21:46,33 --> 0:21:47,967
We'll work with the
states to do it.


344
0:21:47,967 --> 0:21:50,633
Those states with the best ideas
to create jobs and lower energy


345
0:21:50,633 --> 0:21:53,867
bills by constructing more
efficient buildings will receive


346
0:21:53,867 --> 0:21:58,33
federal support to
help make that happen.


347
0:21:58,33 --> 0:22:1,7
America's energy sector is
just one part of an aging


348
0:22:1,7 --> 0:22:5,333
infrastructure badly
in need of repair.


349
0:22:5,333 --> 0:22:8,433
Ask any CEO where they'd
rather locate and hire --


350
0:22:8,433 --> 0:22:11,567
a country with deteriorating
roads and bridges,


351
0:22:11,567 --> 0:22:15,367
or one with high-speed rail and
Internet; high-tech schools,


352
0:22:15,367 --> 0:22:18,2
self-healing power grids.


353
0:22:18,2 --> 0:22:21,567
The CEO of Siemens America -- a
company that brought hundreds of


354
0:22:21,567 --> 0:22:24,667
new jobs to North Carolina --
said that if we upgrade our


355
0:22:24,667 --> 0:22:27,767
infrastructure, they'll
bring even more jobs.


356
0:22:27,767 --> 0:22:29,533
And that's the attitude
of a lot of companies all


357
0:22:29,533 --> 0:22:31,166
around the world.


358
0:22:31,166 --> 0:22:33,166
And I know you want these
job-creating projects in


359
0:22:33,166 --> 0:22:34,166
your district.


360
0:22:34,166 --> 0:22:35,533
I've seen all those
ribbon-cuttings.


361
0:22:35,533 --> 0:22:41,6
(laughter)


362
0:22:41,6 --> 0:22:48,266
So tonight, I propose a
"Fix-It-First" program to put


363
0:22:48,266 --> 0:22:51,4
people to work as soon as
possible on our most urgent


364
0:22:51,4 --> 0:22:55,333
repairs, like the nearly 70,000
structurally deficient bridges


365
0:22:55,333 --> 0:22:56,4
across the country.


366
0:22:56,4 --> 0:23:11,2
(applause)


367
0:23:11,2 --> 0:23:14,433
And to make sure taxpayers
don't shoulder the whole burden,


368
0:23:14,433 --> 0:23:18,66
I'm also proposing a Partnership
to Rebuild America that attracts


369
0:23:18,66 --> 0:23:22,433
private capital to upgrade
what our businesses need most:


370
0:23:22,433 --> 0:23:26,367
modern ports to move our goods,
modern pipelines to withstand a


371
0:23:26,367 --> 0:23:31,133
storm, modern schools
worthy of our children.


372
0:23:31,133 --> 0:23:31,533
(applause)


373
0:23:31,533 --> 0:23:34,6
Let's prove that there's no
better place to do business than


374
0:23:34,6 --> 0:23:36,5
here in the United
States of America,


375
0:23:36,5 --> 0:23:38,0
and let's start right away.


376
0:23:38,0 --> 0:23:40,667
We can get this done.


377
0:23:40,667 --> 0:23:43,767
And part of our rebuilding
effort must also involve our


378
0:23:43,767 --> 0:23:46,633
housing sector.


379
0:23:46,633 --> 0:23:49,66
The good news is our housing
market is finally healing from


380
0:23:49,66 --> 0:23:51,867
the collapse of 2007.


381
0:23:51,867 --> 0:23:56,266
Home prices are rising at the
fastest pace in six years.


382
0:23:56,266 --> 0:23:59,266
Home purchases
are up nearly 50%,


383
0:23:59,266 --> 0:24:2,9
and construction
is expanding again.


384
0:24:2,9 --> 0:24:7,0
But even with mortgage
rates near a 50-year low,


385
0:24:7,0 --> 0:24:10,533
too many families with solid
credit who want to buy a home


386
0:24:10,533 --> 0:24:12,967
are being rejected.


387
0:24:12,967 --> 0:24:16,6
Too many families who never
missed a payment and want to


388
0:24:16,6 --> 0:24:20,367
refinance are being told no.


389
0:24:20,367 --> 0:24:22,867
That's holding our
entire economy back.


390
0:24:22,867 --> 0:24:25,66
We need to fix it.


391
0:24:25,66 --> 0:24:27,8
Right now, there's a bill in
this Congress that would give


392
0:24:27,8 --> 0:24:31,7
every responsible homeowner
in America the chance to save


393
0:24:31,7 --> 0:24:37,66
$3,000 a year by refinancing
at today's rates.


394
0:24:37,66 --> 0:24:40,533
Democrats and Republicans
have supported it before,


395
0:24:40,533 --> 0:24:42,767
so what are we waiting for?


396
0:24:42,767 --> 0:24:44,9
Take a vote, and
send me that bill.


397
0:24:44,9 --> 0:24:51,667
(applause)


398
0:24:51,667 --> 0:24:53,333
Why would we be against that?


399
0:24:53,333 --> 0:24:59,233
(applause)


400
0:24:59,233 --> 0:25:4,433
Why would that be a partisan
issue, helping folks refinance?


401
0:25:4,433 --> 0:25:7,7
Right now, overlapping
regulations keep responsible


402
0:25:7,7 --> 0:25:10,667
young families from
buying their first home.


403
0:25:10,667 --> 0:25:11,667
What's holding us back?


404
0:25:11,667 --> 0:25:17,1
Let's streamline the process,
and help our economy grow.


405
0:25:17,1 --> 0:25:20,467
These initiatives in
manufacturing, energy,


406
0:25:20,467 --> 0:25:24,333
infrastructure, housing --
all these things will help


407
0:25:24,333 --> 0:25:27,2
entrepreneurs and small
business owners expand and


408
0:25:27,2 --> 0:25:29,934
create new jobs.


409
0:25:29,934 --> 0:25:32,967
But none of it will matter
unless we also equip our


410
0:25:32,967 --> 0:25:36,533
citizens with the skills and
training to fill those jobs.


411
0:25:36,533 --> 0:25:43,66
(applause)


412
0:25:43,66 --> 0:25:48,533
And that has to start at
the earliest possible age.


413
0:25:48,533 --> 0:25:53,3
Study after study shows that the
sooner a child begins learning,


414
0:25:53,3 --> 0:25:57,4
the better he or she
does down the road.


415
0:25:57,4 --> 0:26:1,667
But today, fewer than 3 in 10
four year-olds are enrolled in a


416
0:26:1,667 --> 0:26:4,934
high-quality preschool program.


417
0:26:4,934 --> 0:26:7,133
Most middle-class parents can't
afford a few hundred bucks a


418
0:26:7,133 --> 0:26:9,567
week for a private preschool.


419
0:26:9,567 --> 0:26:13,166
And for poor kids who
need help the most,


420
0:26:13,166 --> 0:26:16,433
this lack of access to preschool
education can shadow them for


421
0:26:16,433 --> 0:26:19,166
the rest of their lives.


422
0:26:19,166 --> 0:26:23,9
So tonight, I propose working
with states to make high-quality


423
0:26:23,9 --> 0:26:27,934
preschool available to every
single child in America.


424
0:26:27,934 --> 0:26:30,567
(applause)


425
0:26:30,567 --> 0:26:32,1
That's something we
should be able to do.


426
0:26:32,1 --> 0:26:46,867
(applause)


427
0:26:46,867 --> 0:26:49,834
Every dollar we invest in
high-quality early childhood


428
0:26:49,834 --> 0:26:53,9
education can save more than
seven dollars later on --


429
0:26:53,9 --> 0:26:58,133
by boosting graduation rates,
reducing teen pregnancy,


430
0:26:58,133 --> 0:27:1,834
even reducing violent crime.


431
0:27:1,834 --> 0:27:4,934
In states that make it a
priority to educate our youngest


432
0:27:4,934 --> 0:27:8,834
children, like
Georgia or Oklahoma,


433
0:27:8,834 --> 0:27:13,1
studies show students grow up
more likely to read and do math


434
0:27:13,1 --> 0:27:17,834
at grade level, graduate
high school, hold a job,


435
0:27:17,834 --> 0:27:21,266
form more stable
families of their own.


436
0:27:21,266 --> 0:27:23,5
We know this works.


437
0:27:23,5 --> 0:27:26,7
So let's do what works and make
sure none of our children start


438
0:27:26,7 --> 0:27:28,567
the race of life already behind.


439
0:27:28,567 --> 0:27:30,467
Let's give our kids that chance.


440
0:27:30,467 --> 0:27:42,867
(applause)


441
0:27:42,867 --> 0:27:46,9
Let's also make sure that a high
school diploma puts our kids on


442
0:27:46,9 --> 0:27:49,934
a path to a good job.


443
0:27:49,934 --> 0:27:52,433
Right now, countries like
Germany focus on graduating


444
0:27:52,433 --> 0:27:55,266
their high school students with
the equivalent of a technical


445
0:27:55,266 --> 0:27:58,333
degree from one of our
community colleges.


446
0:27:58,333 --> 0:28:0,5
So those German kids, they're
ready for a job when they


447
0:28:0,5 --> 0:28:2,367
graduate high school.


448
0:28:2,367 --> 0:28:6,133
They've been trained for
the jobs that are there.


449
0:28:6,133 --> 0:28:8,7
Now at schools like
P-Tech in Brooklyn,


450
0:28:8,7 --> 0:28:11,6
a collaboration between New
York Public Schools and City


451
0:28:11,6 --> 0:28:15,4
University of New York and IBM,
students will graduate with a


452
0:28:15,4 --> 0:28:19,166
high school diploma and an
associate's degree in computers


453
0:28:19,166 --> 0:28:21,467
or engineering.


454
0:28:21,467 --> 0:28:24,6
We need to give every American
student opportunities like this.


455
0:28:24,6 --> 0:28:25,6
(applause)


456
0:28:25,6 --> 0:28:32,367
And four years ago, we
started Race to the Top --


457
0:28:32,367 --> 0:28:35,333
a competition that convinced
almost every state to develop


458
0:28:35,333 --> 0:28:38,734
smarter curricula
and higher standards,


459
0:28:38,734 --> 0:28:42,834
all for about 1% of what we
spend on education each year.


460
0:28:42,834 --> 0:28:46,734
Tonight, I'm announcing a new
challenge to redesign America's


461
0:28:46,734 --> 0:28:50,233
high schools so they better
equip graduates for the demands


462
0:28:50,233 --> 0:28:51,834
of a high-tech economy.


463
0:28:51,834 --> 0:28:54,4
And we'll reward schools that
develop new partnerships with


464
0:28:54,4 --> 0:28:57,767
colleges and employers, and
create classes that focus on


465
0:28:57,767 --> 0:29:2,567
science, technology,
engineering and math --


466
0:29:2,567 --> 0:29:5,767
the skills today's employers
are looking for to fill the jobs


467
0:29:5,767 --> 0:29:10,667
that are there right now and
will be there in the future.


468
0:29:10,667 --> 0:29:12,633
Now, even with
better high schools,


469
0:29:12,633 --> 0:29:16,6
most young people will
need some higher education.


470
0:29:16,6 --> 0:29:20,333
It's a simple fact the
more education you've got,


471
0:29:20,333 --> 0:29:23,66
the more likely you are to have
a good job and work your way


472
0:29:23,66 --> 0:29:25,4
into the middle class.


473
0:29:25,4 --> 0:29:28,8
But today, skyrocketing costs
price too many young people out


474
0:29:28,8 --> 0:29:35,0
of a higher education, or saddle
them with unsustainable debt.


475
0:29:35,0 --> 0:29:38,2
Through tax credits,
grants and better loans,


476
0:29:38,2 --> 0:29:40,567
we've made college more
affordable for millions of


477
0:29:40,567 --> 0:29:44,33
students and families
over the last few years.


478
0:29:44,33 --> 0:29:47,9
But taxpayers can't keep on
subsidizing higher and higher


479
0:29:47,9 --> 0:29:51,2
and higher costs for
higher education.


480
0:29:51,2 --> 0:29:54,2
Colleges must do their
part to keep costs down,


481
0:29:54,2 --> 0:29:56,266
and it's our job to
make sure that they do.


482
0:29:56,266 --> 0:30:3,2
(applause)


483
0:30:3,2 --> 0:30:6,834
So tonight, I ask Congress to
change the Higher Education Act


484
0:30:6,834 --> 0:30:10,533
so that affordability and value
are included in determining


485
0:30:10,533 --> 0:30:13,166
which colleges receive
certain types of federal aid.


486
0:30:13,166 --> 0:30:18,233
(applause)


487
0:30:18,233 --> 0:30:20,767
And tomorrow, my administration
will release a new


488
0:30:20,767 --> 0:30:24,333
"College Scorecard" that parents
and students can use to compare


489
0:30:24,333 --> 0:30:26,633
schools based on a
simple criteria --


490
0:30:26,633 --> 0:30:31,767
where you can get the most
bang for your educational buck.


491
0:30:31,767 --> 0:30:36,166
Now, to grow our middle class,
our citizens have to have access


492
0:30:36,166 --> 0:30:38,7
to the education and training
that today's jobs require.


493
0:30:38,7 --> 0:30:42,734
But we also have to make sure
that America remains a place


494
0:30:42,734 --> 0:30:45,667
where everyone who's
willing to work --


495
0:30:45,667 --> 0:30:48,266
everybody who's willing to
work hard has the chance to


496
0:30:48,266 --> 0:30:50,633
get ahead.


497
0:30:50,633 --> 0:30:54,633
Our economy is stronger when
we harness the talents and


498
0:30:54,633 --> 0:30:57,4
ingenuity of striving,
hopeful immigrants.


499
0:30:57,4 --> 0:31:0,5
(applause)


500
0:31:0,5 --> 0:31:3,667
And right now, leaders
from the business, labor,


501
0:31:3,667 --> 0:31:5,533
law enforcement,
faith communities --


502
0:31:5,533 --> 0:31:9,7
they all agree that the time
has come to pass comprehensive


503
0:31:9,7 --> 0:31:10,767
immigration reform.


504
0:31:10,767 --> 0:31:11,633
(applause)


505
0:31:11,633 --> 0:31:12,934
Now is the time to do it.


506
0:31:12,934 --> 0:31:17,767
Now is the time to get it done.


507
0:31:17,767 --> 0:31:19,0
Now is the time to get it done.


508
0:31:19,0 --> 0:31:31,734
(applause)


509
0:31:31,734 --> 0:31:35,266
Real reform means
stronger border security,


510
0:31:35,266 --> 0:31:36,567
and we can build on the progress
my administration has already


511
0:31:36,567 --> 0:31:41,467
made -- putting more boots on
the Southern border than at any


512
0:31:41,467 --> 0:31:45,5
time in our history and reducing
illegal crossings to their


513
0:31:45,5 --> 0:31:48,9
lowest levels in 40 years.


514
0:31:48,9 --> 0:31:52,834
Real reform means establishing
a responsible pathway to earned


515
0:31:52,834 --> 0:31:55,834
citizenship -- a path that
includes passing a background


516
0:31:55,834 --> 0:31:59,4
check, paying taxes and
a meaningful penalty,


517
0:31:59,4 --> 0:32:2,934
learning English, and going to
the back of the line behind the


518
0:32:2,934 --> 0:32:4,5
folks trying to
come here legally.


519
0:32:4,5 --> 0:32:9,667
(applause)


520
0:32:9,667 --> 0:32:14,767
And real reform means fixing the
legal immigration system to cut


521
0:32:14,767 --> 0:32:18,266
waiting periods and attract the
highly-skilled entrepreneurs and


522
0:32:18,266 --> 0:32:21,633
engineers that will help create
jobs and grow our economy.


523
0:32:21,633 --> 0:32:34,533
(applause)


524
0:32:34,533 --> 0:32:39,2
In other words, we know
what needs to be done.


525
0:32:39,2 --> 0:32:42,834
And as we speak, bipartisan
groups in both chambers are


526
0:32:42,834 --> 0:32:44,867
working diligently
to draft a bill,


527
0:32:44,867 --> 0:32:46,667
and I applaud their efforts.


528
0:32:46,667 --> 0:32:48,166
So let's get this done.


529
0:32:48,166 --> 0:32:51,66
Send me a comprehensive
immigration reform bill in the


530
0:32:51,66 --> 0:32:53,767
next few months, and I
will sign it right away.


531
0:32:53,767 --> 0:32:55,567
And America will
be better for it.


532
0:32:55,567 --> 0:32:56,467
(applause)


533
0:32:56,467 --> 0:32:57,867
Let's get it done.


534
0:32:57,867 --> 0:32:58,867
Let's get it done.


535
0:32:58,867 --> 0:33:8,734
(applause)


536
0:33:8,734 --> 0:33:11,667
But we can't stop there.


537
0:33:11,667 --> 0:33:15,4
We know our economy is stronger
when our wives, our mothers,


538
0:33:15,4 --> 0:33:18,834
our daughters can live their
lives free from discrimination


539
0:33:18,834 --> 0:33:23,6
in the workplace, and free from
the fear of domestic violence.


540
0:33:23,6 --> 0:33:26,633
Today, the Senate passed the
Violence Against Women Act that


541
0:33:26,633 --> 0:33:29,567
Joe Biden originally
wrote almost 20 years ago.


542
0:33:29,567 --> 0:33:32,266
And I now urge the
House to do the same.


543
0:33:32,266 --> 0:33:36,2
(applause)


544
0:33:36,2 --> 0:33:37,333
Good job, Joe.


545
0:33:37,333 --> 0:33:46,33
(applause)


546
0:33:46,33 --> 0:33:49,266
And I ask this Congress to
declare that women should earn a


547
0:33:49,266 --> 0:33:54,2
living equal to their efforts,
and finally pass the Paycheck


548
0:33:54,2 --> 0:33:55,5
Fairness Act this year.


549
0:33:55,5 --> 0:34:8,133
(applause)


550
0:34:8,133 --> 0:34:11,6
We know our economy is stronger
when we reward an honest day's


551
0:34:11,6 --> 0:34:15,133
work with honest wages.


552
0:34:15,133 --> 0:34:18,967
But today, a full-time worker
making the minimum wage earns


553
0:34:18,967 --> 0:34:23,533
$14,500 a year.


554
0:34:23,533 --> 0:34:27,233
Even with the tax
relief we put in place,


555
0:34:27,233 --> 0:34:30,8
a family with two kids that
earns the minimum wage still


556
0:34:30,8 --> 0:34:33,767
lives below the poverty line.


557
0:34:33,767 --> 0:34:36,0
That's wrong.


558
0:34:36,0 --> 0:34:38,567
That's why, since the last time
this Congress raised the minimum


559
0:34:38,567 --> 0:34:43,5
wage, 19 states have chosen
to bump theirs even higher.


560
0:34:43,5 --> 0:34:47,567
Tonight, let's declare that in
the wealthiest nation on Earth,


561
0:34:47,567 --> 0:34:51,3
no one who works full-time
should have to live in poverty,


562
0:34:51,3 --> 0:34:54,7
and raise the federal minimum
wage to $9.00 an hour.


563
0:34:54,7 --> 0:34:58,867
(applause)


564
0:34:58,867 --> 0:35:0,266
We should be able
to get that done.


565
0:35:0,266 --> 0:35:7,567
(applause)


566
0:35:7,567 --> 0:35:10,4
This single step would raise
the incomes of millions of


567
0:35:10,4 --> 0:35:12,767
working families.


568
0:35:12,767 --> 0:35:15,33
It could mean the difference
between groceries or the food


569
0:35:15,33 --> 0:35:21,934
bank; rent or eviction; scraping
by or finally getting ahead.


570
0:35:21,934 --> 0:35:23,2
For businesses
across the country,


571
0:35:23,2 --> 0:35:25,667
it would mean customers with
more money in their pockets.


572
0:35:25,667 --> 0:35:29,734
And a whole lot of folks out
there would probably need less


573
0:35:29,734 --> 0:35:32,367
help from government.


574
0:35:32,367 --> 0:35:35,834
In fact, working folks shouldn't
have to wait year after year for


575
0:35:35,834 --> 0:35:39,767
the minimum wage to go up while
CEO pay has never been higher.


576
0:35:39,767 --> 0:35:43,233
So here's an idea that Governor
Romney and I actually agreed on


577
0:35:43,233 --> 0:35:46,567
last year -- let's tie the
minimum wage to the cost of


578
0:35:46,567 --> 0:35:49,5
living, so that it finally
becomes a wage you can live on.


579
0:35:49,5 --> 0:36:1,967
(applause)


580
0:36:1,967 --> 0:36:4,367
Tonight, let's also recognize
that there are communities in


581
0:36:4,367 --> 0:36:6,834
this country where no
matter how hard you work,


582
0:36:6,834 --> 0:36:10,1
it is virtually
impossible to get ahead.


583
0:36:10,1 --> 0:36:14,5
Factory towns decimated from
years of plants packing up.


584
0:36:14,5 --> 0:36:18,834
Inescapable pockets of
poverty, urban and rural,


585
0:36:18,834 --> 0:36:23,133
where young adults are still
fighting for their first job.


586
0:36:23,133 --> 0:36:25,934
America is not a place where the
chance of birth or circumstance


587
0:36:25,934 --> 0:36:27,33
should decide our destiny.


588
0:36:27,33 --> 0:36:31,233
And that's why we need to build
new ladders of opportunity into


589
0:36:31,233 --> 0:36:35,2
the middle class for all who
are willing to climb them.


590
0:36:35,2 --> 0:36:37,867
Let's offer incentives to
companies that hire Americans


591
0:36:37,867 --> 0:36:39,934
who've got what it takes
to fill that job opening,


592
0:36:39,934 --> 0:36:42,4
but have been out of work so
long that no one will give them


593
0:36:42,4 --> 0:36:44,533
a chance anymore.


594
0:36:44,533 --> 0:36:47,233
Let's put people back to work
rebuilding vacant homes in


595
0:36:47,233 --> 0:36:49,4
run-down neighborhoods.


596
0:36:49,4 --> 0:36:53,66
And this year, my administration
will begin to partner with 20 of


597
0:36:53,66 --> 0:36:56,2
the hardest-hit towns in America
to get these communities back


598
0:36:56,2 --> 0:36:57,433
on their feet.


599
0:36:57,433 --> 0:37:0,834
We'll work with local leaders
to target resources at public


600
0:37:0,834 --> 0:37:4,533
safety, and education,
and housing.


601
0:37:4,533 --> 0:37:8,133
We'll give new tax credits to
businesses that hire and invest.


602
0:37:8,133 --> 0:37:11,266
And we'll work to strengthen
families by removing the


603
0:37:11,266 --> 0:37:14,7
financial deterrents to
marriage for low-income couples,


604
0:37:14,7 --> 0:37:16,867
and do more to
encourage fatherhood --


605
0:37:16,867 --> 0:37:19,633
because what makes you a man
isn't the ability to conceive a


606
0:37:19,633 --> 0:37:23,66
child; it's having the
courage to raise one.


607
0:37:23,66 --> 0:37:25,166
And we want to encourage that.


608
0:37:25,166 --> 0:37:26,667
We want to help that.


609
0:37:26,667 --> 0:37:40,133
(applause)


610
0:37:40,133 --> 0:37:42,3
Stronger families.


611
0:37:42,3 --> 0:37:44,8
Stronger communities.


612
0:37:44,8 --> 0:37:47,667
A stronger America.


613
0:37:47,667 --> 0:37:52,8
It is this kind of
prosperity -- broad, shared,


614
0:37:52,8 --> 0:37:55,433
built on a thriving
middle class --


615
0:37:55,433 --> 0:37:59,7
that has always been the
source of our progress at home.


616
0:37:59,7 --> 0:38:2,433
It's also the foundation
of our power and influence


617
0:38:2,433 --> 0:38:5,3
throughout the world.


618
0:38:5,3 --> 0:38:8,567
Tonight, we stand united
in saluting the troops and


619
0:38:8,567 --> 0:38:12,567
civilians who sacrifice
every day to protect us.


620
0:38:12,567 --> 0:38:16,834
Because of them, we can say with
confidence that America will


621
0:38:16,834 --> 0:38:19,834
complete its mission in
Afghanistan and achieve our


622
0:38:19,834 --> 0:38:23,66
objective of defeating
the core of al Qaeda.


623
0:38:23,66 --> 0:38:40,266
(applause)


624
0:38:40,266 --> 0:38:44,433
Already, we have brought home
33,000 of our brave servicemen


625
0:38:44,433 --> 0:38:46,1
and women.


626
0:38:46,1 --> 0:38:49,467
This spring, our forces will
move into a support role,


627
0:38:49,467 --> 0:38:53,266
while Afghan security
forces take the lead.


628
0:38:53,266 --> 0:38:56,1
Tonight, I can announce
that over the next year,


629
0:38:56,1 --> 0:39:0,767
another 34,000 American troops
will come home from Afghanistan.


630
0:39:0,767 --> 0:39:4,1
This drawdown will continue
and by the end of next year,


631
0:39:4,1 --> 0:39:7,1
our war in Afghanistan
will be over.


632
0:39:7,1 --> 0:39:23,834
(applause)


633
0:39:23,834 --> 0:39:27,533
Beyond 2014, America's
commitment to a unified and


634
0:39:27,533 --> 0:39:30,633
sovereign Afghanistan
will endure,


635
0:39:30,633 --> 0:39:33,967
but the nature of our
commitment will change.


636
0:39:33,967 --> 0:39:36,233
We're negotiating an agreement
with the Afghan government that


637
0:39:36,233 --> 0:39:40,3
focuses on two missions --
training and equipping Afghan


638
0:39:40,3 --> 0:39:44,66
forces so that the country
does not again slip into chaos,


639
0:39:44,66 --> 0:39:47,4
and counterterrorism efforts
that allow us to pursue the


640
0:39:47,4 --> 0:39:51,8
remnants of al Qaeda
and their affiliates.


641
0:39:51,8 --> 0:39:56,233
Today, the organization that
attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow


642
0:39:56,233 --> 0:39:57,9
of its former self.


643
0:39:57,9 --> 0:40:3,9
(applause)


644
0:40:3,9 --> 0:40:6,767
It's true, different al Qaeda
affiliates and extremist groups


645
0:40:6,767 --> 0:40:11,734
have emerged -- from the
Arabian Peninsula to Africa.


646
0:40:11,734 --> 0:40:15,367
The threat these groups
pose is evolving.


647
0:40:15,367 --> 0:40:18,66
But to meet this threat, we
don't need to send tens of


648
0:40:18,66 --> 0:40:21,367
thousands of our sons and
daughters abroad or occupy


649
0:40:21,367 --> 0:40:23,166
other nations.


650
0:40:23,166 --> 0:40:26,66
Instead, we'll need to help
countries like Yemen, and Libya,


651
0:40:26,66 --> 0:40:29,5
and Somalia provide
for their own security,


652
0:40:29,5 --> 0:40:31,867
and help allies who take
the fight to terrorists,


653
0:40:31,867 --> 0:40:34,1
as we have in Mali.


654
0:40:34,1 --> 0:40:37,767
And where necessary, through
a range of capabilities,


655
0:40:37,767 --> 0:40:41,433
we will continue to take direct
action against those terrorists


656
0:40:41,433 --> 0:40:44,0
who pose the gravest
threat to Americans.


657
0:40:44,0 --> 0:40:48,1
(applause)


658
0:40:48,1 --> 0:40:58,934
Now, as we do, we must enlist
our values in the fight.


659
0:40:58,934 --> 0:41:2,4
That's why my administration
has worked tirelessly to forge a


660
0:41:2,4 --> 0:41:5,9
durable legal and policy
framework to guide our


661
0:41:5,9 --> 0:41:8,934
counterterrorism efforts.


662
0:41:8,934 --> 0:41:11,8
Throughout, we have kept
Congress fully informed of


663
0:41:11,8 --> 0:41:13,9
our efforts.


664
0:41:13,9 --> 0:41:16,133
I recognize that
in our democracy,


665
0:41:16,133 --> 0:41:18,867
no one should just take my word
for it that we're doing things


666
0:41:18,867 --> 0:41:20,5
the right way.


667
0:41:20,5 --> 0:41:23,633
So in the months ahead, I will
continue to engage Congress to


668
0:41:23,633 --> 0:41:26,1
ensure not only
that our targeting,


669
0:41:26,1 --> 0:41:29,533
detention and prosecution of
terrorists remains consistent


670
0:41:29,533 --> 0:41:33,233
with our laws and system
of checks and balances,


671
0:41:33,233 --> 0:41:36,2
but that our efforts are even
more transparent to the American


672
0:41:36,2 --> 0:41:38,467
people and to the world.


673
0:41:38,467 --> 0:41:43,767
(applause)


674
0:41:43,767 --> 0:41:47,1
Of course, our challenges
don't end with al Qaeda.


675
0:41:47,1 --> 0:41:50,367
America will continue to lead
the effort to prevent the spread


676
0:41:50,367 --> 0:41:53,5
of the world's most
dangerous weapons.


677
0:41:53,5 --> 0:41:56,834
The regime in North Korea must
know they will only achieve


678
0:41:56,834 --> 0:41:58,734
security and prosperity
by meeting their


679
0:41:58,734 --> 0:42:1,467
international obligations.


680
0:42:1,467 --> 0:42:4,33
Provocations of the sort we saw
last night will only further


681
0:42:4,33 --> 0:42:7,166
isolate them, as we
stand by our allies,


682
0:42:7,166 --> 0:42:10,66
strengthen our own missile
defense and lead the world in


683
0:42:10,66 --> 0:42:14,1
taking firm action in
response to these threats.


684
0:42:14,1 --> 0:42:17,0
Likewise, the leaders of Iran
must recognize that now is the


685
0:42:17,0 --> 0:42:20,734
time for a diplomatic solution,
because a coalition stands


686
0:42:20,734 --> 0:42:23,767
united in demanding that
they meet their obligations,


687
0:42:23,767 --> 0:42:27,66
and we will do what is necessary
to prevent them from getting a


688
0:42:27,66 --> 0:42:28,3
nuclear weapon.


689
0:42:28,3 --> 0:42:43,633
(applause)


690
0:42:43,633 --> 0:42:47,266
At the same time, we'll
engage Russia to seek further


691
0:42:47,266 --> 0:42:49,867
reductions in our
nuclear arsenals,


692
0:42:49,867 --> 0:42:52,967
and continue leading the
global effort to secure nuclear


693
0:42:52,967 --> 0:42:55,834
materials that could fall
into the wrong hands --


694
0:42:55,834 --> 0:42:58,867
because our ability to
influence others depends on our


695
0:42:58,867 --> 0:43:4,567
willingness to lead and
meet our obligations.


696
0:43:4,567 --> 0:43:7,5
America must also face
the rapidly growing threat


697
0:43:7,5 --> 0:43:9,266
from cyber-attacks.


698
0:43:9,266 --> 0:43:11,33
(applause)


699
0:43:11,33 --> 0:43:14,667
Now, we know hackers steal
people's identities and


700
0:43:14,667 --> 0:43:17,533
infiltrate private emails.


701
0:43:17,533 --> 0:43:20,1
We know foreign countries
and companies swipe our


702
0:43:20,1 --> 0:43:22,433
corporate secrets.


703
0:43:22,433 --> 0:43:25,5
Now our enemies are also seeking
the ability to sabotage our


704
0:43:25,5 --> 0:43:29,2
power grid, our
financial institutions,


705
0:43:29,2 --> 0:43:32,166
our air traffic control systems.


706
0:43:32,166 --> 0:43:35,934
We cannot look back years
from now and wonder why we did


707
0:43:35,934 --> 0:43:39,0
nothing in the face of real
threats to our security and


708
0:43:39,0 --> 0:43:40,233
our economy.


709
0:43:40,233 --> 0:43:43,9
And that's why, earlier today,
I signed a new executive order


710
0:43:43,9 --> 0:43:46,9
that will strengthen our
cyber defenses by increasing


711
0:43:46,9 --> 0:43:49,867
information sharing, and
developing standards to protect


712
0:43:49,867 --> 0:43:52,8
our national security,
our jobs, and our privacy.


713
0:43:52,8 --> 0:43:58,433
(applause)


714
0:43:58,433 --> 0:44:2,633
But now Congress
must act as well,


715
0:44:2,633 --> 0:44:6,66
by passing legislation to
give our government a greater


716
0:44:6,66 --> 0:44:10,3
capacity to secure our
networks and deter attacks.


717
0:44:10,3 --> 0:44:12,767
This is something we should
be able to get done on a


718
0:44:12,767 --> 0:44:14,233
bipartisan basis.


719
0:44:14,233 --> 0:44:21,333
(applause)


720
0:44:21,333 --> 0:44:23,767
Now, even as we
protect our people,


721
0:44:23,767 --> 0:44:27,33
we should remember that today's
world presents not just dangers,


722
0:44:27,33 --> 0:44:31,367
not just threats, it
presents opportunities.


723
0:44:31,367 --> 0:44:35,633
To boost American exports,
support American jobs and level


724
0:44:35,633 --> 0:44:38,533
the playing field in the
growing markets of Asia,


725
0:44:38,533 --> 0:44:40,4
we intend to complete
negotiations on a


726
0:44:40,4 --> 0:44:41,633
Trans-Pacific Partnership.


727
0:44:41,633 --> 0:44:45,1
And tonight, I'm announcing
that we will launch talks on a


728
0:44:45,1 --> 0:44:48,567
comprehensive Transatlantic
Trade and Investment Partnership


729
0:44:48,567 --> 0:44:51,867
with the European Union --
because trade that is fair and


730
0:44:51,867 --> 0:44:55,0
free across the Atlantic
supports millions of good-paying


731
0:44:55,0 --> 0:44:56,367
American jobs.


732
0:44:56,367 --> 0:45:3,767
(applause)


733
0:45:3,767 --> 0:45:8,266
We also know that progress in
the most impoverished parts of


734
0:45:8,266 --> 0:45:13,133
our world enriches us all --
not only because it creates new


735
0:45:13,133 --> 0:45:18,2
markets, more stable order in
certain regions of the world,


736
0:45:18,2 --> 0:45:21,734
but also because it's
the right thing to do.


737
0:45:21,734 --> 0:45:26,734
In many places, people live on
little more than a dollar a day.


738
0:45:26,734 --> 0:45:30,66
So the United States will join
with our allies to eradicate


739
0:45:30,66 --> 0:45:33,467
such extreme poverty in the next
two decades by connecting more


740
0:45:33,467 --> 0:45:37,166
people to the global
economy; by empowering women;


741
0:45:37,166 --> 0:45:39,467
by giving our young
and brightest minds new


742
0:45:39,467 --> 0:45:43,1
opportunities to serve, and
helping communities to feed,


743
0:45:43,1 --> 0:45:45,834
and power, and
educate themselves;


744
0:45:45,834 --> 0:45:49,567
by saving the world's children
from preventable deaths;


745
0:45:49,567 --> 0:45:53,433
and by realizing the promise
of an AIDS-free generation,


746
0:45:53,433 --> 0:45:55,367
which is within our reach.


747
0:45:55,367 --> 0:46:7,467
(applause)


748
0:46:7,467 --> 0:46:11,633
You see, America must remain a
beacon to all who seek freedom


749
0:46:11,633 --> 0:46:15,8
during this period
of historic change.


750
0:46:15,8 --> 0:46:18,8
I saw the power of hope last
year in Rangoon, in Burma,


751
0:46:18,8 --> 0:46:22,9
when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed
an American President into the


752
0:46:22,9 --> 0:46:26,734
home where she had been
imprisoned for years;


753
0:46:26,734 --> 0:46:28,8
when thousands of Burmese
lined the streets,


754
0:46:28,8 --> 0:46:32,3
waving American flags,
including a man who said,


755
0:46:32,3 --> 0:46:35,867
"There is justice and
law in the United States.


756
0:46:35,867 --> 0:46:40,667
"I want our country
to be like that."


757
0:46:40,667 --> 0:46:44,1
In defense of freedom, we'll
remain the anchor of strong


758
0:46:44,1 --> 0:46:49,433
alliances from the Americas to
Africa; from Europe to Asia.


759
0:46:49,433 --> 0:46:52,3
In the Middle East, we will
stand with citizens as they


760
0:46:52,3 --> 0:46:56,233
demand their universal rights,
and support stable transitions


761
0:46:56,233 --> 0:46:57,567
to democracy.


762
0:46:57,567 --> 0:47:4,767
(applause)


763
0:47:4,767 --> 0:47:9,266
We know the process
will be messy,


764
0:47:9,266 --> 0:47:12,233
and we cannot presume to
dictate the course of change in


765
0:47:12,233 --> 0:47:15,233
countries like Egypt,
but we can -- and will --


766
0:47:15,233 --> 0:47:18,433
insist on respect for
the fundamental rights of


767
0:47:18,433 --> 0:47:20,6
all people.


768
0:47:20,6 --> 0:47:23,266
We'll keep the pressure on a
Syrian regime that has murdered


769
0:47:23,266 --> 0:47:26,667
its own people, and support
opposition leaders that respect


770
0:47:26,667 --> 0:47:29,6
the rights of every Syrian.


771
0:47:29,6 --> 0:47:33,3
And we will stand steadfast with
Israel in pursuit of security


772
0:47:33,3 --> 0:47:34,934
and a lasting peace.


773
0:47:34,934 --> 0:47:51,767
(applause)


774
0:47:51,767 --> 0:47:53,667
These are the messages I'll
deliver when I travel to the


775
0:47:53,667 --> 0:47:57,333
Middle East next month.


776
0:47:57,333 --> 0:48:2,166
And all this work depends on the
courage and sacrifice of those


777
0:48:2,166 --> 0:48:6,867
who serve in dangerous places
at great personal risk --


778
0:48:6,867 --> 0:48:11,233
our diplomats, our
intelligence officers,


779
0:48:11,233 --> 0:48:15,333
and the men and women of the
United States Armed Forces.


780
0:48:15,333 --> 0:48:16,667
As long as I'm
Commander-in-Chief,


781
0:48:16,667 --> 0:48:19,767
we will do whatever we must to
protect those who serve their


782
0:48:19,767 --> 0:48:23,7
country abroad, and we will
maintain the best military the


783
0:48:23,7 --> 0:48:25,33
world has ever known.


784
0:48:25,33 --> 0:48:39,734
(applause)


785
0:48:39,734 --> 0:48:41,6
We'll invest in
new capabilities,


786
0:48:41,6 --> 0:48:45,367
even as we reduce waste
and wartime spending.


787
0:48:45,367 --> 0:48:48,6
We will ensure equal treatment
for all servicemembers,


788
0:48:48,6 --> 0:48:52,1
and equal benefits for their
families -- gay and straight.


789
0:48:52,1 --> 0:49:2,734
(applause)


790
0:49:2,734 --> 0:49:6,633
We will draw upon the courage
and skills of our sisters and


791
0:49:6,633 --> 0:49:10,133
daughters and moms, because
women have proven under fire


792
0:49:10,133 --> 0:49:13,66
that they are ready for combat.


793
0:49:13,66 --> 0:49:15,367
We will keep faith
with our veterans,


794
0:49:15,367 --> 0:49:18,633
investing in world-class care,
including mental health care,


795
0:49:18,633 --> 0:49:20,133
for our wounded warriors --


796
0:49:20,133 --> 0:49:34,8
(applause)


797
0:49:34,8 --> 0:49:37,433
-- supporting our
military families;


798
0:49:37,433 --> 0:49:39,967
giving our veterans the
benefits and education and job


799
0:49:39,967 --> 0:49:41,7
opportunities that
they have earned.


800
0:49:41,7 --> 0:49:43,8
And I want to thank
my wife, Michelle,


801
0:49:43,8 --> 0:49:47,0
and Dr. Jill Biden for their
continued dedication to serving


802
0:49:47,0 --> 0:49:50,667
our military families as
well as they have served us.


803
0:49:50,667 --> 0:49:52,1
Thank you, honey.


804
0:49:52,1 --> 0:49:53,133
Thank you, Jill.


805
0:49:53,133 --> 0:50:7,166
(applause)


806
0:50:7,166 --> 0:50:11,33
Defending our freedom, though,
is not just the job of our


807
0:50:11,33 --> 0:50:13,8
military alone.


808
0:50:13,8 --> 0:50:17,66
We must all do our part to make
sure our God-given rights are


809
0:50:17,66 --> 0:50:20,367
protected here at home.


810
0:50:20,367 --> 0:50:23,8
That includes one of the
most fundamental rights of a


811
0:50:23,8 --> 0:50:27,0
democracy: the right to vote.


812
0:50:27,0 --> 0:50:41,3
(applause)


813
0:50:41,3 --> 0:50:45,967
When any American, no matter
where they live or what their


814
0:50:45,967 --> 0:50:51,967
party, are denied that right
because they can't afford to


815
0:50:51,967 --> 0:50:56,867
wait for five or six or seven
hours just to cast their ballot,


816
0:50:56,867 --> 0:50:59,2
we are betraying our ideals.


817
0:50:59,2 --> 0:51:2,333
(applause)


818
0:51:2,333 --> 0:51:10,5
So tonight, I'm announcing
a nonpartisan commission to


819
0:51:10,5 --> 0:51:13,66
improve the voting
experience in America.


820
0:51:13,66 --> 0:51:16,867
And it definitely
needs improvement.


821
0:51:16,867 --> 0:51:20,0
I'm asking two long-time
experts in the field --


822
0:51:20,0 --> 0:51:23,66
who, by the way, recently served
as the top attorneys for my


823
0:51:23,66 --> 0:51:27,567
campaign and for Governor
Romney's campaign -- to lead it.


824
0:51:27,567 --> 0:51:30,5
We can fix this, and we will.


825
0:51:30,5 --> 0:51:33,4
The American people demand
it, and so does our democracy.


826
0:51:33,4 --> 0:51:47,867
(applause)


827
0:51:47,867 --> 0:51:54,133
Of course, what I've said
tonight matters little if we


828
0:51:54,133 --> 0:51:58,734
don't come together to protect
our most precious resource:


829
0:51:58,734 --> 0:52:1,767
our children.


830
0:52:1,767 --> 0:52:6,734
It has been two
months since Newtown.


831
0:52:6,734 --> 0:52:9,266
I know this is not the first
time this country has debated


832
0:52:9,266 --> 0:52:13,66
how to reduce gun violence.


833
0:52:13,66 --> 0:52:16,8
But this time is different.


834
0:52:16,8 --> 0:52:20,0
Overwhelming majorities
of Americans --


835
0:52:20,0 --> 0:52:22,9
Americans who believe in
the Second Amendment --


836
0:52:22,9 --> 0:52:26,66
have come together around
common-sense reform,


837
0:52:26,66 --> 0:52:28,834
like background checks that will
make it harder for criminals to


838
0:52:28,834 --> 0:52:30,367
get their hands on a gun.


839
0:52:30,367 --> 0:52:36,934
(applause)


840
0:52:36,934 --> 0:52:39,9
Senators of both parties are
working together on tough new


841
0:52:39,9 --> 0:52:42,9
laws to prevent anyone
from buying guns for resale


842
0:52:42,9 --> 0:52:45,0
to criminals.


843
0:52:45,0 --> 0:52:48,266
Police chiefs are asking our
help to get weapons of war and


844
0:52:48,266 --> 0:52:51,2
massive ammunition
magazines off our streets,


845
0:52:51,2 --> 0:52:53,8
because these police chiefs,
they're tired of seeing their


846
0:52:53,8 --> 0:52:59,3
guys and gals being outgunned.


847
0:52:59,3 --> 0:53:3,33
Each of these proposals
deserves a vote in Congress.


848
0:53:3,33 --> 0:53:18,867
(applause)


849
0:53:18,867 --> 0:53:23,467
Now, if you want to vote
no, that's your choice.


850
0:53:23,467 --> 0:53:27,166
But these proposals
deserve a vote.


851
0:53:27,166 --> 0:53:29,967
Because in the two
months since Newtown,


852
0:53:29,967 --> 0:53:33,667
more than a thousand
birthdays, graduations,


853
0:53:33,667 --> 0:53:38,767
anniversaries have been stolen
from our lives by a bullet from


854
0:53:38,767 --> 0:53:44,266
a gun -- more than a thousand.


855
0:53:44,266 --> 0:53:51,166
One of those we lost was a young
girl named Hadiya Pendleton.


856
0:53:51,166 --> 0:53:54,2
She was 15 years old.


857
0:53:54,2 --> 0:53:58,333
She loved Fig Newtons
and lip gloss.


858
0:53:58,333 --> 0:54:1,5
She was a majorette.


859
0:54:1,5 --> 0:54:4,3
She was so good to her friends
they all thought they were


860
0:54:4,3 --> 0:54:7,233
her best friend.


861
0:54:7,233 --> 0:54:10,667
Just three weeks ago, she
was here, in Washington,


862
0:54:10,667 --> 0:54:14,133
with her classmates,
performing for her country at


863
0:54:14,133 --> 0:54:16,967
my inauguration.


864
0:54:16,967 --> 0:54:20,7
And a week later, she was shot
and killed in a Chicago park


865
0:54:20,7 --> 0:54:27,2
after school, just a
mile away from my house.


866
0:54:27,2 --> 0:54:31,3
Hadiya's parents, Nate and Cleo,
are in this chamber tonight,


867
0:54:31,3 --> 0:54:35,166
along with more than two dozen
Americans whose lives have been


868
0:54:35,166 --> 0:54:38,567
torn apart by gun violence.


869
0:54:38,567 --> 0:54:40,233
They deserve a vote.


870
0:54:40,233 --> 0:54:44,233
(applause)


871
0:54:44,233 --> 0:54:45,5
They deserve a vote.


872
0:54:45,5 --> 0:54:53,734
(applause)


873
0:54:53,734 --> 0:54:54,934
They deserve a vote.


874
0:54:54,934 --> 0:55:4,133
(applause)


875
0:55:4,133 --> 0:55:6,5
Gabby Giffords deserves a vote.


876
0:55:6,5 --> 0:55:9,0
(applause)


877
0:55:9,0 --> 0:55:11,834
The families of
Newtown deserve a vote.


878
0:55:11,834 --> 0:55:13,5
(applause)


879
0:55:13,5 --> 0:55:16,0
The families of
Aurora deserve a vote.


880
0:55:16,0 --> 0:55:17,6
(applause)


881
0:55:17,6 --> 0:55:21,467
The families of Oak Creek
and Tucson and Blacksburg,


882
0:55:21,467 --> 0:55:24,734
and the countless other
communities ripped open by gun


883
0:55:24,734 --> 0:55:26,934
violence -- they
deserve a simple vote.


884
0:55:26,934 --> 0:55:35,266
(applause)


885
0:55:35,266 --> 0:55:41,5
They deserve a simple vote.


886
0:55:41,5 --> 0:55:45,533
Our actions will not prevent
every senseless act of violence


887
0:55:45,533 --> 0:55:48,6
in this country.


888
0:55:48,6 --> 0:55:51,0
In fact, no laws,
no initiatives,


889
0:55:51,0 --> 0:55:54,9
no administrative acts will
perfectly solve all the


890
0:55:54,9 --> 0:55:58,6
challenges I've
outlined tonight.


891
0:55:58,6 --> 0:56:3,133
But we were never sent
here to be perfect.


892
0:56:3,133 --> 0:56:7,266
We were sent here to make
what difference we can,


893
0:56:7,266 --> 0:56:11,767
to secure this nation,
expand opportunity,


894
0:56:11,767 --> 0:56:15,467
uphold our ideals through
the hard, often frustrating,


895
0:56:15,467 --> 0:56:22,7
but absolutely necessary
work of self-government.


896
0:56:22,7 --> 0:56:26,367
We were sent here to look out
for our fellow Americans the


897
0:56:26,367 --> 0:56:31,166
same way they look out for
one another, every single day,


898
0:56:31,166 --> 0:56:36,66
usually without fanfare,
all across this country.


899
0:56:36,66 --> 0:56:39,266
We should follow their example.


900
0:56:39,266 --> 0:56:42,433
We should follow the example
of a New York City nurse named


901
0:56:42,433 --> 0:56:45,3
Menchu Sanchez.


902
0:56:45,3 --> 0:56:49,166
When Hurricane Sandy plunged
her hospital into darkness,


903
0:56:49,166 --> 0:56:53,734
she wasn't thinking about
how her own home was faring.


904
0:56:53,734 --> 0:56:57,567
Her mind was on the 20 precious
newborns in her care and the


905
0:56:57,567 --> 0:57:3,333
rescue plan she devised
that kept them all safe.


906
0:57:3,333 --> 0:57:7,1
We should follow the example
of a North Miami woman named


907
0:57:7,1 --> 0:57:10,266
Desiline Victor.


908
0:57:10,266 --> 0:57:11,934
When Desiline arrived
at her polling place,


909
0:57:11,934 --> 0:57:14,633
she was told the wait to
vote might be six hours.


910
0:57:14,633 --> 0:57:19,333
And as time ticked by, her
concern was not with her tired


911
0:57:19,333 --> 0:57:23,133
body or aching feet, but whether
folks like her would get to


912
0:57:23,133 --> 0:57:25,233
have their say.


913
0:57:25,233 --> 0:57:28,6
And hour after hour, a throng of
people stayed in line to support


914
0:57:28,6 --> 0:57:32,667
her -- because Desiline
is 102 years old.


915
0:57:32,667 --> 0:57:33,767
(applause)


916
0:57:33,767 --> 0:57:35,734
And they erupted in cheers when
she finally put on a sticker


917
0:57:35,734 --> 0:57:37,867
that read, "I voted."


918
0:57:37,867 --> 0:58:11,867
(applause)


919
0:58:11,867 --> 0:58:14,133
We should follow the example
of a police officer named


920
0:58:14,133 --> 0:58:17,2
Brian Murphy.


921
0:58:17,2 --> 0:58:23,0
When a gunman opened fire on
a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and


922
0:58:23,0 --> 0:58:25,834
Brian was the first to arrive,
he did not consider his


923
0:58:25,834 --> 0:58:28,66
own safety.


924
0:58:28,66 --> 0:58:31,7
He fought back until help
arrived and ordered his fellow


925
0:58:31,7 --> 0:58:35,834
officers to protect the safety
of the Americans worshiping


926
0:58:35,834 --> 0:58:40,3
inside, even as he lay
bleeding from 12 bullet wounds.


927
0:58:40,3 --> 0:58:45,734
And when asked how he
did that, Brian said,


928
0:58:45,734 --> 0:58:49,9
"That's just the
way we're made."


929
0:58:49,9 --> 0:58:53,633
That's just the way we're made.


930
0:58:53,633 --> 0:58:58,0
We may do different jobs
and wear different uniforms,


931
0:58:58,0 --> 0:59:3,33
and hold different views
than the person beside us.


932
0:59:3,33 --> 0:59:8,567
But as Americans, we all
share the same proud title --


933
0:59:8,567 --> 0:59:11,433
we are citizens.


934
0:59:11,433 --> 0:59:14,467
It's a word that doesn't just
describe our nationality or


935
0:59:14,467 --> 0:59:17,433
legal status.


936
0:59:17,433 --> 0:59:20,834
It describes the way we're made.


937
0:59:20,834 --> 0:59:24,66
It describes what we believe.


938
0:59:24,66 --> 0:59:28,33
It captures the enduring idea
that this country only works


939
0:59:28,33 --> 0:59:31,133
when we accept certain
obligations to one another and


940
0:59:31,133 --> 0:59:35,133
to future generations, that our
rights are wrapped up in the


941
0:59:35,133 --> 0:59:39,533
rights of others; and that well
into our third century as a

nation, it remains
the task of us all,

as citizens of

to be the authors of the
next great chapter of our

0:59:51,367 --> 0:59:52,367
