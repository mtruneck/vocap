1
0:0:0,979 --> 0:0:3,18
MORNING. I JUST WANT TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
ABOUT


2
0:0:3,18 --> 0:0:6,47
THE LAB. MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN
COMING


3
0:0:6,47 --> 0:0:8,75
THROUGH THE LABS AND TALKING TO YOU AND ONE
OF THE


4
0:0:8,75 --> 0:0:11,509
THINGS THAT I HAVE NOTICED IS THAT I HAVE
TRIED TO


5
0:0:11,509 --> 0:0:15,19
GIVE YOU A SETTING FOR THE EXAM QUESTIONS.
AND


6
0:0:15,19 --> 0:0:17,31
SOMETIMES THE EXAM QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO
PRESENT YOU


7
0:0:17,31 --> 0:0:21,109
WITH AN INTERMEDIATE STAGE. LIKE YOU MIGHT
SAY SPORE,


8
0:0:21,109 --> 0:0:24,369
AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE
FORWARD


9
0:0:24,369 --> 0:0:26,81
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT COULD COME FROM
THAT SPORE.


10
0:0:26,81 --> 0:0:30,409
AND MOVE BACKWARDS WHAT MIGHT HAVE RESULTED
IN THE


11
0:0:30,409 --> 0:0:33,76
PRODUCTION OF THAT SPORE. AND I AM TALKING
TO SOME OF


12
0:0:33,76 --> 0:0:36,26
YOU I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU ARE TRYING
TO


13
0:0:36,26 --> 0:0:39,39
MEMORIZE IT. AND IF YOU TRY TO MEMORIZE IS
IT IS


14
0:0:39,39 --> 0:0:41,64
GOING TO BE HARD BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO PUT THIS


15
0:0:41,64 --> 0:0:44,1
IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR MEMORIZATION. BUT IF
YOU


16
0:0:44,1 --> 0:0:46,96
UNDERSTAND IT, YOU WILL BE MUCH BETTER PLACE
FOR THE


17
0:0:46,96 --> 0:0:47,76
MIDTERM.


18
0:0:47,76 --> 0:0:49,59
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO I HAVE SPOKEN TO
AND


19
0:0:49,59 --> 0:0:51,85
 EXPRESSED A SENSE OF FRUSTRATION BECAUSE
YOU ARE


20
0:0:51,85 --> 0:0:54,5
CLEARLY MEMORIZING IT, I WANT TO TELL YOU
THAT I AM


21
0:0:54,5 --> 0:0:57,859
THERE TO HELP YOU AND TRYING TO IMPRESS UPON
YOU THE


22
0:0:57,859 --> 0:1:1,739
IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING NOT MEMORIZING.
THOSE OF


23
0:1:1,739 --> 0:1:4,32
YOU WHO TRY TO MEMORIZE WILL REALLY NOT VERY
ABLE TO


24
0:1:4,32 --> 0:1:6,87
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS WHEN I CAME THROUGH THE
LAB. AND


25
0:1:6,87 --> 0:1:9,97
I GUESS YOU SORT OF SENSED THAT WHEN I TALKED
WITH


26
0:1:9,97 --> 0:1:11,33
YOU.


27
0:1:11,33 --> 0:1:14,22
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS? ALL RIGHT. TODAY


28
0:1:14,22 --> 0:1:16,9
WHAT WE ARE GOING TO START DOING IS TO TALK
ABOUT THE


29
0:1:16,9 --> 0:1:19,61
FIRST ORGAN IN THE PLANTS THAT WE ARE ENCOUNTERING.


30
0:1:19,61 --> 0:1:22,84
AN ORGAN IS SOMETHING WHICH IS MADE UP OF
A NUMBER OF


31
0:1:22,84 --> 0:1:25,5
DIFFERENT CELL TYPES, A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
TISSUE


32
0:1:25,5 --> 0:1:29,51
TYPES. AND THE FIRST ORGAN WE ARE GOING TO
TALK ABOUT


33
0:1:29,51 --> 0:1:33,7
BEGINNING TODAY IS THE ROOT SYSTEM. NOW FOR
MOST OF


34
0:1:33,7 --> 0:1:37,6
US THE ROOT SYSTEM IS THE PART OF THE PLANT
THAT IS,


35
0:1:37,6 --> 0:1:40,25
WE NEVER THINK ABOUT, WE NEVER SEE. IT IS
THE PART OF


36
0:1:40,25 --> 0:1:42,8
THE PLANT THAT IS UNDERGROUND, AT LEAST THAT
IS YOUR


37
0:1:42,8 --> 0:1:46,9
 IMPRESSION OF IT AND IT FITS THE OLD SAYING,
OUT OF


38
0:1:46,9 --> 0:1:50,75
SIGHT, OUT OF MIND. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOME
SLIDES TO


39
0:1:50,75 --> 0:1:53,69
ILLUSTRATE TO YOU THAT ROOTS COME IN VERY
MANY


40
0:1:53,69 --> 0:1:56,86
DIFFERENT FORMS OTHER THAN WHAT YOU CONSIDER
TO BE THE


41
0:1:56,86 --> 0:1:59,27
STEREOTYPICAL FORM BELOW GROUND. BUT I WOULD
LIKE TO


42
0:1:59,27 --> 0:2:2,61
BEGIN FIRST BY DISCUSSING SOME OF THE MAIN
FUNCTIONS


43
0:2:2,61 --> 0:2:7,6
OF THE ROOT. SOME OF THESE MAIN FUNCTIONS
AND WE WILL


44
0:2:7,6 --> 0:2:11,109
DISCUSS SOME OF THEM IN MORE DETAIL TODAY.
THE FIRST


45
0:2:11,109 --> 0:2:17,829
ONE IS ANCHORAGE OR SUPPORT. AND YOU WILL
SEE SOME


46
0:2:17,829 --> 0:2:19,989
GOOD EXAMPLES OF THIS. ANCHORAGE OR SUPPORT.


47
0:2:19,989 --> 0:2:24,75
THE SECOND, AND IT IS A MAJOR FUNCTION THAT
WE


48
0:2:24,75 --> 0:2:27,18
WILL SPEND QUITE A BIT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT
IT, IS


49
0:2:27,18 --> 0:2:39,209
ABSORPTION OF WATER AND NUTRIENTS. A THIRD
FUNCTION


50
0:2:39,209 --> 0:2:41,79
AMONG THE MANY WHICH ROOTS HAVE AND WHAT WE
WILL


51
0:2:41,79 --> 0:2:43,959
BRIEFLY TOUCH UPON TODAY IS THAT THEY CAN
BECOME


52
0:2:43,959 --> 0:2:48,37
A STORAGE ORGAN.


53
0:2:48,37 --> 0:2:51,15
AND MANY OF YOU WITHOUT REALIZING THAT IT
IS


54
0:2:51,15 --> 0:2:53,629
A ROOT OR REALIZING IT IS A STORAGE ORGAN
ENCOUNTER


55
0:2:53,629 --> 0:2:58,379
 ROOTS DAILY IF NOT WEEKLY. HERE ARE TWO
EXAMPLES OF


56
0:2:58,379 --> 0:3:2,93
ROOT STORAGE ORGANS, CARROTS, BEETS, THESE
ARE STORAGE


57
0:3:2,93 --> 0:3:6,409
ORGANS WHERE SUGARS AND STARCHES ARE PLACED
IN THE


58
0:3:6,409 --> 0:3:9,18
ROOT SYSTEM AND THEY PROVIDE THE PLANT MATERIAL
TO


59
0:3:9,18 --> 0:3:11,59
START GROWING THE FOLLOWING YEAR WHEN THE
SPRING COMES


60
0:3:11,59 --> 0:3:14,359
ALONG. WE CAN CONSUME THESE BECAUSE THEY ARE
SWEET OR


61
0:3:14,359 --> 0:3:16,17
BECAUSE THEY HAVE STARCH IN THEM.


62
0:3:16,17 --> 0:3:18,719
A LESS COMMON, AT LEAST TO MANY OF YOU ROOT


63
0:3:18,719 --> 0:3:21,54
SYSTEM, IS CASABA. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO COME
FROM


64
0:3:21,54 --> 0:3:24,45
TROPICAL CULTURES OR MAYBE EAST ASIAN CULTURES
THIS IS


65
0:3:24,45 --> 0:3:27,219
SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD USE. IT REPRESENTS
A ROOT


66
0:3:27,219 --> 0:3:29,409
SYSTEM IN WHICH LARGE AMOUNTS OF STARCH HAVE
BEEN


67
0:3:29,409 --> 0:3:31,129
STORED.


68
0:3:31,129 --> 0:3:33,749
AN EXAMPLE OF A ROOT SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT STORAGE


69
0:3:33,749 --> 0:3:36,54
BUT ALSO HAS PLAYED PROMINENT ROLES IN MANY
CULTURES


70
0:3:36,54 --> 0:3:40,65
PARTICULARLY IN ASIAN CULTURES IS OVER HERE,
THIS IS


71
0:3:40,65 --> 0:3:44,999
A ROOT OF A GINSENG. GINSENG SUPPOSEDLY HAS
MEDICINAL


72
0:3:44,999 --> 0:3:48,25
PROPERTIES AND THE PROPERTIES OF THE GINSENG
ARE


73
0:3:48,25 --> 0:3:52,469
 SUPPOSEDLY DICTATED BY THE SHAPE OF THE
ROOT BY


74
0:3:52,469 --> 0:3:55,359
WHETHER IT HAS BRANCHES. THIS IS SORT OF A
CULTURAL


75
0:3:55,359 --> 0:3:58,139
ONE. IT IS A THICKER ROOT. IT IS A STORAGE
ROOT, BUT


76
0:3:58,139 --> 0:4:1,59
IT IS MAINLY INVOLVED IN CULTURAL PRACTICES
NOT FOR


77
0:4:1,59 --> 0:4:5,51
THEIR STORAGE PROPERTIES. AND FINALLY WHAT
I WANT TO


78
0:4:5,51 --> 0:4:8,56
MENTION AS FAR AS THE FUNCTION OF THE ROOTS
IS THAT


79
0:4:8,56 --> 0:4:10,709
AND WE PROBABLY WON'T HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT
IT, BUT


80
0:4:10,709 --> 0:4:13,209
IT IS AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION, IS THAT ROOTS
FREQUENTLY


81
0:4:13,209 --> 0:4:22,81
ESTABLISH SYMBIOTIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH SOIL


82
0:4:22,81 --> 0:4:32,53
MICROORGANISMS.


83
0:4:32,53 --> 0:4:35,98
AND, THIS ESTABLISHMENT OF SOIL MICROORGANISMS


84
0:4:35,98 --> 0:4:39,85
BENEFITS BOTH THE ROOT SYSTEM AND THE MICROORGANISM.


85
0:4:39,85 --> 0:4:43,72
WE ARE HAVING SOME PROBLEMS HERE. OKAY. LET'S
BEGIN


86
0:4:43,72 --> 0:4:46,33
WITH THE SLIDES, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW
YOU SOME


87
0:4:46,33 --> 0:4:50,14
SLIDES NOW TO ILLUSTRATE THE DIVERSITY THAT
ROOT


88
0:4:50,14 --> 0:4:54,63
SYSTEMS HAVE BEYOND WHAT YOU NORMALLY ASSOCIATE
WITH


89
0:4:54,63 --> 0:4:57,97
A ROOT SYSTEM.


90
0:4:57,97 --> 0:5:3,22
THE FIRST SLIDE IS OF A TROPICAL, THESE ARE
 MOSTLY TROPICAL ROOT SYSTEMS, PLANT CALLED


91
0:5:3,22 --> 0:5:4,1
SCREW PINE


92
0:5:4,1 --> 0:5:8,14
OR PANDANUS, AND IN THIS PARTICULAR PLANT
THE ROOTS


93
0:5:8,14 --> 0:5:10,79
FORM ON THE STEM AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT,
AND THEY


94
0:5:10,79 --> 0:5:13,87
SUPPORT THE PLANT. THEY KEEP IT UPRIGHT AND
THEY ALSO


95
0:5:13,87 --> 0:5:16,51
ABSORB WATER ONCE THEY ENTER THE SOIL. HERE
IS


96
0:5:16,51 --> 0:5:19,46
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A ROOT OF A TROPICAL PLANT
OF


97
0:5:19,46 --> 0:5:22,87
A RELATED TO THE FIG FAMILY. THESE ARE ACTUALLY
ROOTS


98
0:5:22,87 --> 0:5:24,89
HERE. THEY LOOK LIKE BRANCHES, WHAT THEY DO
IS THEY


99
0:5:24,89 --> 0:5:27,77
SUPPORT THESE VERY LARGE BRANCHES WHICH ALLOW
THIS


100
0:5:27,77 --> 0:5:31,57
TREE TO COVER A LARGE AREA. HERE IS AN EXAMPLES
OF


101
0:5:31,57 --> 0:5:34,47
A ROOT SYSTEM IN A, OF A VERY TALL TREE IN
THE


102
0:5:34,47 --> 0:5:39,38
TROPICS, AREA WHICH IS RECEIVES VERY HIGH
WINDS


103
0:5:39,38 --> 0:5:42,53
OCCASIONALLY. AND THESE ARE SO CALLED BUTTRESS
ROOTS,


104
0:5:42,53 --> 0:5:44,4
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE DIVERSITY OF ROOTS,
AND


105
0:5:44,4 --> 0:5:47,61
THEY PROVIDE SORT OF EXTRA SUPPORT FOR THE
TREE IN


106
0:5:47,61 --> 0:5:50,6
WINDY WEATHER. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN
TO


107
0:5:50,6 --> 0:5:53,8
FLORIDA OR DOWN TO MEXICO, YOU MAY HAVE ENCOUNTERED


108
0:5:53,8 --> 0:5:57,39
MANGROVE SWAMPS AND IN MANGROVE SWAMPS THE
WATER COMES


109
0:5:57,39 --> 0:6:0,24
 IN WITH THE TIDES SEVERAL TIMES A DAY, AND
THESE ROOT


110
0:6:0,24 --> 0:6:3,46
SYSTEMS ACT TO ELEVATE THE TREES, THE MANGROVE
TREES,


111
0:6:3,46 --> 0:6:6,74
ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE WATER. THE MANGROVE
ROOTS CAN


112
0:6:6,74 --> 0:6:10,22
ALSO BE MODIFIED TO GROW UP ABOVE THE LEVEL
OF THE


113
0:6:10,22 --> 0:6:13,62
WATER AND PROVIDE AN AIR TUBE SO TO SPEAK
FOR AIR TO


114
0:6:13,62 --> 0:6:15,96
COME DOWN TO THE ROOT SYSTEM, WHICH OTHERWISE
WOULD BE


115
0:6:15,96 --> 0:6:19,41
FLOODED AND WOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO OXYGEN.
HERE IS


116
0:6:19,41 --> 0:6:21,57
A ROOT SYSTEM THAT MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR
WITH, WITH


117
0:6:21,57 --> 0:6:24,4
THE ROOT SYSTEM OF CLIMBING IVY. THIS ROOT
SYSTEM


118
0:6:24,4 --> 0:6:27,52
SECRETES A GLUE AND THIS GLUE, IF YOU TRY
TO PULL THE


119
0:6:27,52 --> 0:6:30,25
IVY OFF FROM THE BUILDING, FREQUENTLY WILL
STAY ON THE


120
0:6:30,25 --> 0:6:33,37
BUILDING, IT STICKS SO TIGHTLY. FOR THOSE
OF YOU WHO


121
0:6:33,37 --> 0:6:36,8
ARE INTERESTED IN BIOMIMICRY THAT IS USING
NATURE TO


122
0:6:36,8 --> 0:6:39,97
DESIGN VARIOUS THINGS, THIS GLUE FOR EXAMPLE
WOULD BE


123
0:6:39,97 --> 0:6:42,78
A GOOD START. NO ONE HAS EVER ANALYZED THIS
GLUE TO


124
0:6:42,78 --> 0:6:46,14
SEE WHETHER IT IS SOMETHING WE AS HUMANS MIGHT
BE ABLE


125
0:6:46,14 --> 0:6:48,13
TO USE IN OUR LIVES.


126
0:6:48,13 --> 0:6:52,46
HERE IS AN INTERESTING ROOT SYSTEM, NOT
 UNDERGROUND, THIS IS A ROOT SYSTEM FORMING


127
0:6:52,46 --> 0:6:53,0
ON THE STEM


128
0:6:53,0 --> 0:6:55,58
OF A PALM TREE. AND THESE ROOTS, WHICH GREW
OUT OF


129
0:6:55,58 --> 0:6:57,93
THE PALM TREE, STOP GROWING WHEN THEY ARE
RELATIVELY


130
0:6:57,93 --> 0:7:0,74
SHORT AND THEY TURN INTO SPINES. AND THIS
IS


131
0:7:0,74 --> 0:7:3,52
PRESUMABLY TO PREVENT ANIMALS FROM CLIMBING
UP THE


132
0:7:3,52 --> 0:7:7,65
TREE AND EATING THE FRUITS OR THE FLOWERS.


133
0:7:7,65 --> 0:7:9,52
HERE IS A ROOT SYSTEM OF A PLANT WHERE


134
0:7:9,52 --> 0:7:11,75
ESSENTIALLY THE WHOLE BODY OF THE PLANT CONSISTS
OF


135
0:7:11,75 --> 0:7:14,79
THE ROOT SYSTEM. EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE THAT
IS


136
0:7:14,79 --> 0:7:17,39
GREEN, AND IN FACT EVEN THIS WHITE STUFF,
THIS GREEN


137
0:7:17,39 --> 0:7:20,15
IS ROOT SYSTEM. THE SHOOT SYSTEM IN THIS PLANT
HAS


138
0:7:20,15 --> 0:7:23,67
BEEN REDUCED TO A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE
BODY. AND


139
0:7:23,67 --> 0:7:26,72
ALL OF THE BODY THAT YOU SEE HERE, WHICH IS
GREEN, IS


140
0:7:26,72 --> 0:7:28,46
THE ROOT SYSTEM AND THE ROOT SYSTEM IS THE


141
0:7:28,46 --> 0:7:33,2
PHOTOSYNTHETIC PART OF THE PLANT. SHOW YOU
AGAIN USES


142
0:7:33,2 --> 0:7:36,81
OF ROOTS IN OUR LIVES WHERE WE HAVE CASABA,
BEETS AND


143
0:7:36,81 --> 0:7:39,56
CARROTS. THESE ARE STORAGE ROOTS WHICH STORE
LARGE


144
0:7:39,56 --> 0:7:42,48
AMOUNTS OF SUGAR AND STARCH. AND FINALLY,
I WANT TO


145
0:7:42,48 --> 0:7:44,67
 MENTION THAT ALL OF OVER THE UNITED STATES,
IN FACT,


146
0:7:44,67 --> 0:7:47,25
ALL OVER THE WORLD, ROOT SYSTEMS CAUSE TREMENDOUS


147
0:7:47,25 --> 0:7:50,58
DAMAGE. VERY EXPENSIVE DAMAGE. THIS IS A PICTURE


148
0:7:50,58 --> 0:7:54,51
INSIDE A SEWER. AND MANY OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED


149
0:7:54,51 --> 0:7:57,61
HAVING YOUR WATER PIPE OR YOUR DRAINS BACKED
UP. MOST


150
0:7:57,61 --> 0:8:0,8
OFTEN IF IT IS NOT WITHIN THE HOUSE. IF IT
IS OUTSIDE


151
0:8:0,8 --> 0:8:2,65
OF THE HOUSE, IT IS BECAUSE ROOT SYSTEMS HAVE
INVADED


152
0:8:2,65 --> 0:8:6,14
THE PIPE AND ARE SUCKING THE MINERALS UP.
IN THIS


153
0:8:6,14 --> 0:8:9,53
CASE, IN A SEWER, AND THESE MINERALS THEN
ARE


154
0:8:9,53 --> 0:8:12,5
NOURISHING THE PLANT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I THINK I


155
0:8:12,5 --> 0:8:14,98
WILL LEAVE THIS SCREEN DOWN, SORRY, AT THE
SAME TIME,


156
0:8:14,98 --> 0:8:21,2
BLOCKING YOUR, YOUR WATER TO LEAVE. NOW, WHAT
I WOULD


157
0:8:21,2 --> 0:8:26,24
LIKE TO DO, IS TO BEGIN A DISCUSSION OF THE


158
0:8:26,24 --> 0:8:28,0
DEVELOPMENT OF THE ROOT SYSTEM. AND I AM GOING
TO


159
0:8:28,0 --> 0:8:30,0
LEAVE THIS SCREEN DOWN BECAUSE I AM GOING
TO SHOW YOU


160
0:8:30,0 --> 0:8:32,38
MORE SLIDES IN A MOMENT. AND I WOULD LIKE
TO BEGIN


161
0:8:32,38 --> 0:8:36,99
WITH THE EMBRYO. IN THE EMBRYO THE FIRST ROOT
SYSTEM


162
0:8:36,99 --> 0:8:45,29
IS PRESENT. SO, THE FIRST ROOT SYSTEM IS PRESENT
IN


163
0:8:45,29 --> 0:8:51,459
 THE EMBRYO.


164
0:8:51,459 --> 0:8:54,12
AND WE CALL THAT FIRST ROOT OR ROOT SYSTEM
THE


165
0:8:54,12 --> 0:9:1,3
PRIMARY ROOT. IT IS OFTEN REFERRED IN YOUR
TEXT BOOK


166
0:9:1,3 --> 0:9:4,399
OR IN COMMON LITERATURE AS A TAP ROOT.


167
0:9:4,399 --> 0:9:10,829
A TAP ROOT.


168
0:9:10,829 --> 0:9:19,19
NOW, IF THIS WAS A EUDICOT THE TAP ROOT GROWS


169
0:9:19,19 --> 0:9:26,55
DOWN. GROWS STRONGLY DOWNWARD.


170
0:9:26,55 --> 0:9:30,339
AND GOES DEEPLY INTO THE SOIL.


171
0:9:30,339 --> 0:9:32,839
SO, YOU WOULD FIND THIS FIRST ROOT, WHICH
COMES


172
0:9:32,839 --> 0:9:36,72
FROM THE EMBRYO GROWING DOWN, IT BECOMES PROMINENT,


173
0:9:36,72 --> 0:9:43,5
THE MOST PROMINENT OF THE ROOTS.


174
0:9:43,5 --> 0:9:51,12
IT CAN ALSO PRODUCE BRANCH ROOTS.


175
0:9:51,12 --> 0:9:51,249
AND THESE


176
0:9:51,249 --> 0:9:54,98
BRANCH ROOTS ARE KNOWN AS SECONDARY ROOTS.
AS OPPOSED


177
0:9:54,98 --> 0:10:1,6
TO PRIMARY. OR LATERAL ROOTS. ANOTHER TERM.


178
0:10:1,6 --> 0:10:7,309
WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF
THE


179
0:10:7,309 --> 0:10:10,579
BRANCH ROOTS AND LATERAL ROOTS IN A FEW MINUTES.
THIS


180
0:10:10,579 --> 0:10:16,199
IS WHAT OCCURS IN A EUDICOT. IN A MONOCOT,
IN


181
0:10:16,199 --> 0:10:20,49
A MONOCOT EMBRYO, WE ALSO HAVE A PRIMARY ROOT
IN THE


182
0:10:20,49 --> 0:10:28,199
 EMBRYO.


183
0:10:28,199 --> 0:10:32,759
BUT THIS ROOT IS SHORT LIVED. THAT IS, IT


184
0:10:32,759 --> 0:10:38,48
DOESN'T LIVE VERY LONG. AND IS QUICKLY REPLACED
BY


185
0:10:38,48 --> 0:10:46,5
SECONDARY ROOTS. I WILL ABBREVIATE SECONDARY
WITH


186
0:10:46,5 --> 0:10:51,9
A 2. SECONDARY ROOTS.


187
0:10:51,9 --> 0:10:54,779
THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE ROOT SYSTEMS RESULTS
IN


188
0:10:54,779 --> 0:10:59,769
THESE MONOCOTS HAVING A FIBROUS ROOT SYSTEM.
FIBROUS


189
0:10:59,769 --> 0:11:6,68
ROOT SYSTEM. AND BECAUSE MONOCOTS PRODUCE


190
0:11:6,68 --> 0:11:11,87
A RELATIVELY SHALLOW FIBROUS ROOT SYSTEM,
FOR THOSE OF


191
0:11:11,87 --> 0:11:15,37
YOU WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE OR WHO KNOW OF A FOREST
FIRES


192
0:11:15,37 --> 0:11:18,4
OR FIRES WHICH BURN THE LAND, SAY IN SOUTHERN


193
0:11:18,4 --> 0:11:21,199
CALIFORNIA. BEFORE THE WINTER RAINS COME,
THE LAND


194
0:11:21,199 --> 0:11:23,87
WHICH HAS BEEN BURNED IS BROADCAST AND COVERED
WITH


195
0:11:23,87 --> 0:11:27,79
SEED USUALLY BY HELICOPTERS OF MONOCOT, MONOCOT
SEEDS.


196
0:11:27,79 --> 0:11:30,319
AND IT IS HOPED THAT THESE SEEDS WILL GERMINATE
AND


197
0:11:30,319 --> 0:11:33,16
BECAUSE OF THE FIBROUS NATURE OF THE ROOT
SYSTEMS,


198
0:11:33,16 --> 0:11:35,769
THAT THEY WILL KNIT TOGETHER THE SOIL AND
PREVENT


199
0:11:35,769 --> 0:11:39,79
EROSION. SO, THESE ROOT SYSTEMS HAVE A COMMON
USE AS


200
0:11:39,79 --> 0:11:43,79
 FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED. NOW, WHAT ABOUT
THE SIZE OF


201
0:11:43,79 --> 0:11:45,8
ROOT SYSTEMS. BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDER GROUND
MOST OF


202
0:11:45,8 --> 0:11:48,9
US DON'T REALLY HAVE AN APPRECIATION OF THE
SIZE OF


203
0:11:48,9 --> 0:11:53,139
ROOT SYSTEMS. THE RATIO OF SHOOT TO ROOT FREQUENTLY


204
0:11:53,139 --> 0:11:56,959
CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF A PLANT. WHEN
A SEED


205
0:11:56,959 --> 0:11:59,619
IS TRYING TO ESTABLISH ITSELF, IT USUALLY
HAS MORE


206
0:11:59,619 --> 0:12:2,22
ROOT THAN SHOOT. BECAUSE IT WANTS TO BE ABLE
TO GET


207
0:12:2,22 --> 0:12:5,129
LOTS OF WATER AND NUTRIENTS BEFORE IT MAKES
A BIG


208
0:12:5,129 --> 0:12:9,54
SHOOT SYSTEM. AS A PLANT AGES AND GETS TO
BE AN ADULT


209
0:12:9,54 --> 0:12:12,68
OR MATURE INDIVIDUAL, THE ROOT AND SHOOT SYSTEM
COME


210
0:12:12,68 --> 0:12:14,92
INTO BALANCE WITH EACH OTHER, SO THERE IS
A ABOUT A 1


211
0:12:14,92 --> 0:12:18,19
TO 1 RATIO BETWEEN THE VEGETABLE MATTER AND
THE ROOT


212
0:12:18,19 --> 0:12:19,97
AND THE SHOOT SYSTEM. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
ARE


213
0:12:19,97 --> 0:12:22,61
GARDENERS, WHEN YOU TRANSPLANT THE PLANT AND
WHEN YOU


214
0:12:22,61 --> 0:12:25,529
CUT IT OUT OF THE SOIL AND MOVE IT SOMEPLACE
ELSE,


215
0:12:25,529 --> 0:12:28,589
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IS ESSENTIALLY SEVERING
OR CUTTING


216
0:12:28,589 --> 0:12:30,949
OFF PART OF THE ROOT SYSTEM. YOU ARE CHANGING
THAT


217
0:12:30,949 --> 0:12:34,669
RATIO BY CUTTING OFF THE ROOT SYSTEM. AND
THAT IS WHY


218
0:12:34,669 --> 0:12:37,379
 IT IS RECOMMENDED WHEN YOU TRANSPLANT A
PLANT TO CUT


219
0:12:37,379 --> 0:12:39,999
OFF SOME OF THE SHOOT SYSTEM AT THE SAME TIME.


220
0:12:39,999 --> 0:12:43,91
TO BETTER KEEP THIS RATIO IN ORDER. SO WHAT
I


221
0:12:43,91 --> 0:12:47,69
WOULD LIKE TO DO NOW IS TO SHOW YOU A FEW
SLIDES OF


222
0:12:47,69 --> 0:12:50,97
DIFFERENT ROOT SYSTEMS AND SHOW YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT


223
0:12:50,97 --> 0:12:55,279
THE PRIMARY ROOTS. HERE IS A SEEDLING OF A
RADISH


224
0:12:55,279 --> 0:12:59,48
WHICH HAS JUST GERMINATED AND HERE IS A EUDICOT.
HERE


225
0:12:59,48 --> 0:13:2,369
IS THE PRIMARY ROOT. HERE ARE THE COTYLEDONS
AND THE


226
0:13:2,369 --> 0:13:5,629
PRIMARY ROOT GROWS STRAIGHT DOWN. THIS IS
A, AS


227
0:13:5,629 --> 0:13:8,339
OPPOSED TO THE ROOT SYSTEM OF A MONOCOT. THIS
IS A


228
0:13:8,339 --> 0:13:10,86
CORN PLANT. MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN CORN PLANTS
BUT


229
0:13:10,86 --> 0:13:13,869
HAVEN'T REALIZED THAT THESE ARE ROOTS WHICH
ARE


230
0:13:13,869 --> 0:13:17,839
FORMING ON THE STEM AND THEY ACTUALLY REPLACE
THE


231
0:13:17,839 --> 0:13:20,689
PRIMARY ROOT, WHICH HAS DIED. SO, THAT IF
WE COULD


232
0:13:20,689 --> 0:13:24,249
PEEL AWAY THE SOIL FROM A CORN ROOT SYSTEM,
WE


233
0:13:24,249 --> 0:13:27,89
WOULDN'T FIND ANY ROOT PARTICULARLY PROMINENT,
WE


234
0:13:27,89 --> 0:13:29,49
WOULD FIND A LOT OF ROOTS AT THE SURFACE AND
THESE ARE


235
0:13:29,49 --> 0:13:32,259
ALL, THEY ARE NOT PRIMARY ROOTS, THEY ARE
ALL


236
0:13:32,259 --> 0:13:34,749
 SECONDARY ROOTS OR ANOTHER TYPE OF ROOT
SYSTEM. BUT


237
0:13:34,749 --> 0:13:37,199
THEY ARE NOT PRIMARY ROOTS.


238
0:13:37,199 --> 0:13:40,29
THIS IS, AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING LIKE EUDICOT,


239
0:13:40,29 --> 0:13:42,689
IN WHICH THE PRIMARY ROOT IS STILL EVIDENT
HERE IN


240
0:13:42,689 --> 0:13:45,629
THIS PARTICULAR PLANT. THIS IS CLOVER, OR
ALFALFA AND


241
0:13:45,629 --> 0:13:48,4
YOU CAN SEE THE PRIMARY ROOT GROWING STRAIGHT
DOWN.


242
0:13:48,4 --> 0:13:50,639
BUT IT ALSO, THIS ROOT SYSTEM HAS MADE SECONDARIES
OR


243
0:13:50,639 --> 0:13:54,19
BRANCH ROOTS ALONG THE SURFACE OF THE SOIL.
HERE IS


244
0:13:54,19 --> 0:13:56,67
AN EXAMPLE OF A MATURE INDIVIDUAL, AN APPLE
TREE, IN


245
0:13:56,67 --> 0:13:59,309
WHICH THE ROOT SYSTEM WAS EXCAVATED. HERE
IS THE


246
0:13:59,309 --> 0:14:2,429
SHOOT SYSTEM, AND TO GIVE YOU SOME IDEA OF
THE BIOMASS


247
0:14:2,429 --> 0:14:6,16
THAT IS IN THE ROOT SYSTEM, THIS EXCAVATION,
NOTICE


248
0:14:6,16 --> 0:14:8,55
THAT THE ROOT SYSTEM HAS FREQUENTLY MORE EXTENSIVE,


249
0:14:8,55 --> 0:14:11,189
GOES OUT FURTHER THAN THE SHOOT SYSTEM DOES.
AND


250
0:14:11,189 --> 0:14:14,42
PERHAPS THE BEST EXAMPLE I CAN SHOW YOU OF
THAT, OF


251
0:14:14,42 --> 0:14:16,73
THE EXTENT OF THE ROOT SYSTEM, THIS IS TAKEN
DOWN IN


252
0:14:16,73 --> 0:14:18,999
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE DESERT. HERE IS
AN


253
0:14:18,999 --> 0:14:23,22
INDIVIDUAL OVER HERE AND HE HAS EXCAVATED
A ROOT


254
0:14:23,22 --> 0:14:25,99
 SYSTEM OR COMING FROM THIS PARTICULAR PLANT.
SHOWING


255
0:14:25,99 --> 0:14:29,199
THAT THE ROOT SYSTEMS CAN HAVE QUITE EXTENSIVE
AREAS


256
0:14:29,199 --> 0:14:31,679
THAT THEY COVER AND DEPENDING UPON THE ENVIRONMENT
IN


257
0:14:31,679 --> 0:14:33,829
WHICH THE PLANT IS GROWING, THEY CAN COVER


258
0:14:33,829 --> 0:14:35,439
CONSIDERABLE AREAS.


259
0:14:35,439 --> 0:14:38,61
SO, THESE ARE THE ROOT SYSTEMS AS FAR AS THEIR


260
0:14:38,61 --> 0:14:41,79
DIVERSITY, AS FAR AS THEIR COVERAGE.


261
0:14:41,79 --> 0:14:45,4
AND NOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO BEGIN
TO


262
0:14:45,4 --> 0:14:48,22
TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ROOT DEVELOPMENT.
AND,


263
0:14:48,22 --> 0:14:50,79
THIS WILL BE A SETTING FOR SOME OF THE GROWTH
AND


264
0:14:50,79 --> 0:14:52,639
DEVELOPMENT THAT WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT
LATER IN THE


265
0:14:52,639 --> 0:14:58,79
CLASS. AND, FOR THIS PARTICULAR INTRODUCTION,
I HAVE


266
0:14:58,79 --> 0:15:0,809
BROUGHT A MODEL ALONG, AND YOU WILL HAVE THIS
SAME


267
0:15:0,809 --> 0:15:3,86
MODEL IN THE CLASS. AND WHAT I WANT TO POINT
OUT TO


268
0:15:3,86 --> 0:15:6,889
YOU ON THIS MODEL IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO MADE
THE


269
0:15:6,889 --> 0:15:9,529
MODEL AND THIS IS REALLY PRETTY GOOD FOR OUR
CLASS,


270
0:15:9,529 --> 0:15:12,449
HAVE DIVIDED THE ROOT SYSTEM INTO TWO PARTS;
INTO THIS


271
0:15:12,449 --> 0:15:15,189
KIND OF GRAYISH PART, WHICH IS AT THE TIP
AND THIS


272
0:15:15,189 --> 0:15:17,369
 DARKER PART OVER HERE.


273
0:15:17,369 --> 0:15:19,639
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO TALK ABOUT THESE


274
0:15:19,639 --> 0:15:22,5
TWO PORTIONS. AND WE WILL BEGIN FIRST WITH
THE GRAY


275
0:15:22,5 --> 0:15:27,209
PART. SO LET ME FIRST MAKE A SECTION DOWN
THROUGH THE


276
0:15:27,209 --> 0:15:29,679
CENTER OF THIS ROOT. A SECTION, WHICH IS A


277
0:15:29,679 --> 0:15:32,279
LONGITUDINAL SECTION, WHICH IS ON THIS SIDE
HERE. WE


278
0:15:32,279 --> 0:15:34,6
ARE GOING TO CUT THAT LONGITUDINALLY AND I
AM GOING TO


279
0:15:34,6 --> 0:15:38,67
DRAW THAT SECTION FOR YOU UP HERE ON THE BOARD.
SO,


280
0:15:38,67 --> 0:15:47,649
HERE IS A LONG STUDENT SIGNAL SECTION OF A
ROOT. WE


281
0:15:47,649 --> 0:15:51,269
ARE GOING TO DRAW THESE TWO MAIN TISSUES THAT
ARE


282
0:15:51,269 --> 0:15:55,869
ILLUSTRATED BY THIS MODEL HERE.


283
0:15:55,869 --> 0:15:57,939
THE GRAY TISSUE TOWARD THE BACK OR TOWARD
THE


284
0:15:57,939 --> 0:16:5,11
BOTTOM, IS A TISSUE WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE
ROOT CAP.


285
0:16:5,11 --> 0:16:8,59
AND THE DARKER TISSUE, WHICH COMPRISES MOST
OF THE


286
0:16:8,59 --> 0:16:15,209
MODEL OVER HERE, IS THE MAIN ROOT BODY.


287
0:16:15,209 --> 0:16:18,179
MAIN ROOT BODY. AND I WANT TO PUT ONE MORE


288
0:16:18,179 --> 0:16:20,86
LANDMARK ON THIS PICTURE BECAUSE WE WILL BE
REFERRING


289
0:16:20,86 --> 0:16:23,879
TO IT AS WE GO THROUGH THE TALK TODAY. AND
THAT


290
0:16:23,879 --> 0:16:27,329
 LANDMARK IS A GROUP OF CELLS IN THIS REGION
HERE,


291
0:16:27,329 --> 0:16:42,489
WHICH IS THE REGION OF THE ROOT APICAL MERISTEM.
AND


292
0:16:42,489 --> 0:16:44,769
NOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO BEGIN TO
TALK TO YOU


293
0:16:44,769 --> 0:16:48,79
ABOUT THOSE TWO MAIN TISSUES WHICH COMPRISE
THE ROOT.


294
0:16:48,79 --> 0:16:50,97
THE MAIN BODY OF THE ROOT, AND THE ROOT CAP.
AND


295
0:16:50,97 --> 0:16:56,869
LET'S BEGIN FIRST WITH THE ROOT CAP. THE ROOT
CAP HAS


296
0:16:56,869 --> 0:17:1,569
A NUMBER OF REMARKABLE FUNCTIONS. THE FIRST
FUNCTION


297
0:17:1,569 --> 0:17:13,519
IS THAT IT PROTECTS THE ROOT MERISTEM AS THE
ROOT


298
0:17:13,519 --> 0:17:21,699
ADVANCES THROUGH THE SOIL.


299
0:17:21,699 --> 0:17:22,76
JUST LIKE IN THE SHOOT


300
0:17:22,76 --> 0:17:25,559
WHERE WE SAID THERE WERE EITHER THE BENDING
OF THE


301
0:17:25,559 --> 0:17:28,529
EPICOTYL OR THE HYPOCOTYL OR A SHEATH COVERING
THE


302
0:17:28,529 --> 0:17:32,82
SHOOT APICAL MERISTEM, THIS ROOT CAP COVERS
THE ROOT


303
0:17:32,82 --> 0:17:36,32
APICAL MERISTEM AND PROTECTS IT AS THE ROOT
GROWS


304
0:17:36,32 --> 0:17:40,24
THROUGH THE SOIL. ANOTHER RELATIVELY INTERESTING


305
0:17:40,24 --> 0:17:42,23
FUNCTION AND AGAIN SOMETHING WHICH WE HAVEN'T


306
0:17:42,23 --> 0:17:45,38
EXPLOITED, WE HAVEN'T REALLY ANALYZED, IS
TA IS ROOT


307
0:17:45,38 --> 0:17:53,149
SYSTEM OR THE ROOT CAP SECRETES A LUBRICANT.
AND THIS


308
0:17:53,149 --> 0:17:57,22
LUBRICANT IS THOUGHT TO HELP OR EASE THE PASSAGE
OF


309
0:17:57,22 --> 0:18:1,21
 THE ROOT THROUGH THE SOIL. AND A THIRD FUNCTION
OF


310
0:18:1,21 --> 0:18:3,89
THE MANY, WHICH THE ROOT CAP DOES, AND WHICH
WE CAN


311
0:18:3,89 --> 0:18:6,75
ONLY TALK ABOUT TODAY, A THIRD FUNCTION IS
THAT THE


312
0:18:6,75 --> 0:18:16,89
ROOT CAP IS THE SITE OF PERCEPTION OF GRAVITY.
IT IS


313
0:18:16,89 --> 0:18:19,45
THE SITE WHERE GRAVITY IS PERCEIVED IN THE
ROOT


314
0:18:19,45 --> 0:18:29,1
SYSTEM. IN OTHER WORDS THE ACTIVITIES OF THE
CAP


315
0:18:29,1 --> 0:18:41,39
ALLOW A ROOT TO ORIENT TO GRAVITY. AND I WOULD
LIKE


316
0:18:41,39 --> 0:18:44,39
TO DISCUSS WITH YOU BRIEFLY HOW THIS OCCURS,
BECAUSE


317
0:18:44,39 --> 0:18:48,519
IT IS REALLY QUITE A REMARKABLE SYSTEM. I
WILL DRAW


318
0:18:48,519 --> 0:18:52,25
FOR YOU ON THIS PARTICULAR DIAGRAM JUST THE
ROOT CAP.


319
0:18:52,25 --> 0:18:56,7
NOT THE MAIN BODY. SO THE ROOT IS HERE AND
HERE IS


320
0:18:56,7 --> 0:19:2,46
THE CAP. AND I WANT TO PUT A COUPLE OF CELLS
IN THIS


321
0:19:2,46 --> 0:19:5,46
CAP, WHICH ARE INVOLVED, WE BELIEVE, IN THE
PERCEPTION


322
0:19:5,46 --> 0:19:7,98
OF GRAVITY. AND I AM JUST GOING TO MAKE TWO
OF THEM,


323
0:19:7,98 --> 0:19:11,71
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MORE OF THEM IN THE CAP.
THESE


324
0:19:11,71 --> 0:19:19,429
CELLS ARE CALLED STATOCYTES. AND IF WE COULD
LOOK AT


325
0:19:19,429 --> 0:19:23,13
ONE OF THESE CELLS MORE CAREFULLY IN HIGHER
POWER,


326
0:19:23,13 --> 0:19:27,83
A HIGHER POWER VIEW, WE WOULD FIND THAT ON
THEIR


327
0:19:27,83 --> 0:19:35,929
 LOWER-MOST SURFACE, ON THEIR LOWER-MOST
SURFACE, THEY


328
0:19:35,929 --> 0:19:47,32
WOULD HAVE COLLECTIONS OF MEMBRANE-BOUND STARCH


329
0:19:47,32 --> 0:19:54,419
GRAINS. MEMBRANE-BOUND STARCH GRAINS WHICH
HAVE


330
0:19:54,419 --> 0:20:0,649
COLLECTED ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE STATOCYTE.


331
0:20:0,649 --> 0:20:3,1
THESE MEMBRANE-BOUND STARCH GRAINS ARE GIVEN


332
0:20:3,1 --> 0:20:10,84
A NAME. THEY ARE CALLED AMYLOPLAST. AND NOW
I WOULD


333
0:20:10,84 --> 0:20:15,39
LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW WE THINK THE
AMYLOPLAST


334
0:20:15,39 --> 0:20:21,559
ARE INVOLVED IN THE PERCEPTION OF THE GRAVITY
VECTOR.


335
0:20:21,559 --> 0:20:23,919
YOU NOTICE THAT I SAID THAT THE AMYLOPLAST
ARE ON THE


336
0:20:23,919 --> 0:20:26,84
LOWER MOST SURFACE OF THE PARTICULAR STATOCYTE
THAT


337
0:20:26,84 --> 0:20:29,5
THEY ARE IN. THEY ARE ON THE LOWER MOST SURFACE


338
0:20:29,5 --> 0:20:32,72
BECAUSE THEY ARE HEAVY. THEY ARE DENSE. SO,
LET'S


339
0:20:32,72 --> 0:20:35,33
TAKE A STATOCYTE AND WE WILL ONLY LOOK AT
ONE


340
0:20:35,33 --> 0:20:38,75
STATOCYTE HERE. IT IS IN THE CAP. AND WE ARE
GOING


341
0:20:38,75 --> 0:20:44,74
TO CALL THIS SIDE OF THE ROOT A, OF THE STATOCYTE
A,


342
0:20:44,74 --> 0:20:52,74
AND THIS SIDE B. AND AT TIME ZERO, THE ROOT
IS IN


343
0:20:52,74 --> 0:20:56,809
THIS PARTICULAR ORIENTATION LIKE SO, AND NOW
WE ARE


344
0:20:56,809 --> 0:21:1,33
GOING TO DO IS TAKE THE ROOT AND TURN IT ON
ITS SIDE.


345
0:21:1,33 --> 0:21:6,169
 TURN IT ON ITS SIDE LIKE SO. SO, NOW WHEN
WE TURN IT


346
0:21:6,169 --> 0:21:14,7
ON ITS SIDE THE NEW LOWER SURFACE IS GOING
TO BE B AND


347
0:21:14,7 --> 0:21:20,22
A IS GOING TO BE OVER HERE. AND WHAT IS GOING
TO


348
0:21:20,22 --> 0:21:25,38
HAPPEN IS THAT THESE STARCH GRAINS ARE GOING
TO FALL


349
0:21:25,38 --> 0:21:30,63
TO THE NEW LOWER SURFACE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT
IT IS


350
0:21:30,63 --> 0:21:34,24
THE MOVEMENT OF THESE STARCH GRAINS TO THE
LOWER MOST


351
0:21:34,24 --> 0:21:38,19
SURFACE WHICH ACTUALLY ACCOUNTS FOR BOTH THE


352
0:21:38,19 --> 0:21:44,13
PERCEPTION OF GRAVITY AND ULTIMATELY WITH
TIME THE


353
0:21:44,13 --> 0:21:47,69
REORIENTATION OF THE ROOT TO THE GRAVITY VECTOR.
THIS


354
0:21:47,69 --> 0:21:51,1
IS A VERY INTERESTING MECHANISM. IT WAS STUDIED
BY


355
0:21:51,1 --> 0:21:53,75
DARWIN AND HIS SON FRANCIS AND THEY HAVE WRITTEN


356
0:21:53,75 --> 0:21:57,279
A LARGE NUMBER OF PAPERS ON THIS PARTICULAR
SYSTEM AND


357
0:21:57,279 --> 0:22:0,11
IT REALLY FASCINATED THEM. AND DARWIN WAS
ONE OF THE


358
0:22:0,11 --> 0:22:3,12
FIRST TO APPRECIATE THIS PARTICULAR ACTIVITY
WHICH


359
0:22:3,12 --> 0:22:7,539
WENT ON IN THE ROOT. NOW, IF YOU TAKE OFF
THE ROOT


360
0:22:7,539 --> 0:22:11,38
CAP OF A ROOT, WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN?
WELL,


361
0:22:11,38 --> 0:22:14,399
IF YOU TAKE OFF THE CAP OF A ROOT IT, YOU
WILL SEE IN


362
0:22:14,399 --> 0:22:16,76
A SLIDE THAT I SHOW YOU, IT DOESN'T RESPOND
TO GRAVITY


363
0:22:16,76 --> 0:22:19,22
 ANYMORE. IT CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHERE THE
GRAVITY


364
0:22:19,22 --> 0:22:23,21
VECTOR IS. AND NASA HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN ROOT
SYSTEMS


365
0:22:23,21 --> 0:22:25,94
AND THEY HAVE TAKEN THEM UP INTO THE SPACE
SHUTTLE OR


366
0:22:25,94 --> 0:22:29,679
INTO THE SPACE STATIONS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS,
WHICH


367
0:22:29,679 --> 0:22:32,309
WAY WOULD THE ROOT SYSTEM GROW. ANYBODY HAVE
ANY IDEA


368
0:22:32,309 --> 0:22:34,32
WHICH WAY THE ROOT SYSTEM WOULD GROW IN THE


369
0:22:34,32 --> 0:22:37,919
MICROGRAVITY OR GRAVITY?


370
0:22:37,919 --> 0:22:41,529
ANY IDEAS? EVERYWHERE. THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.


371
0:22:41,529 --> 0:22:43,889
IT GROWS EVERYWHERE. THERE IS NOTHING FOR
IT, RANDOM,


372
0:22:43,889 --> 0:22:46,289
NOTHING FOR IT TO PICK UP ON BUT IN FACT WHAT
IT DOES


373
0:22:46,289 --> 0:22:49,929
PICK UP ON AS THE ASTRONAUTS WALK AROUND THE
SPACE


374
0:22:49,929 --> 0:22:52,889
SHUTTLE OR THE SPACE STATION THEY IMPART SMALL
MONTH


375
0:22:52,889 --> 0:22:55,22
MEN TA AND THE ROOTS ARE ABLE TO PICK THAT
UP AND SO


376
0:22:55,22 --> 0:22:58,39
THEY DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF PERCEPTION, BUT
MOSTLY


377
0:22:58,39 --> 0:23:0,389
THEY GROW EVERY DIRECTION BECAUSE THEY DON'T
HAVE


378
0:23:0,389 --> 0:23:4,57
ANYWAY OF SEDIMENTING THEIR STARCH GRAINS.
NOW, WHAT


379
0:23:4,57 --> 0:23:7,6
I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO SPEND SOME TIME LOOKING
AT


380
0:23:7,6 --> 0:23:10,909
THE MAIN BODY OF THE ROOT. THIS OTHER PORTION
OF THE


381
0:23:10,909 --> 0:23:16,32
 ROOT WHICH IS REALLY OCCUPIES MOST OF THE,
OF THE


382
0:23:16,32 --> 0:23:19,419
ROOT, THE CAP IS ONLY A VERY TINY PART. AND
LET'S


383
0:23:19,419 --> 0:23:22,0
MAKE ANOTHER DRAWING OF THAT SAME ROOT, WHICH
WE HAD


384
0:23:22,0 --> 0:23:25,94
BEFORE. AND THE POINTS I WANT TO MAKE TO YOU
ARE THE


385
0:23:25,94 --> 0:23:33,29
FOLLOWING: WE HAVE THE MERISTEM, WHICH WE
SAID WAS


386
0:23:33,29 --> 0:23:36,399
A ZONE OF HIGH DIVISION. THAT IS WHERE CELLS
ARE


387
0:23:36,399 --> 0:23:40,659
BEING PRODUCED. IF WE GO A LITTLE FURTHER
BACK ON THE


388
0:23:40,659 --> 0:23:47,179
ROOT WE FIND WE HAVE CELLS ELONGATING. CELLS


389
0:23:47,179 --> 0:23:52,48
ELONGATING. AND IF WE GO EVEN FURTHER BACK
IN THE


390
0:23:52,48 --> 0:24:1,899
ROOT WE FIND THAT THE CELLS ARE DIFFERENTIATING.
THAT


391
0:24:1,899 --> 0:24:4,21
IS, THEY ARE BECOMING THE VARIOUS CELL TYPES
THAT WE


392
0:24:4,21 --> 0:24:8,659
TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, COLLENCHYMA, FIBERS AND
XYLEM AND


393
0:24:8,659 --> 0:24:14,889
PHLOEM. NOW, BECAUSE THESE 3 DIFFERENT EVENTS
OCCUR


394
0:24:14,889 --> 0:24:18,22
WITHIN A SINGLE ROOT, DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGISTS
HAVE


395
0:24:18,22 --> 0:24:21,22
BEEN USING ROOTS FOR STUDIES FOR A LONG TIME.
BECAUSE


396
0:24:21,22 --> 0:24:25,29
IN A SINGLE ORGAN YOU CAN HAVE CELLS DIVIDING,


397
0:24:25,29 --> 0:24:27,99
ENLARGING AND UNDERGOING A STATE OF DIFFERENTIATION


398
0:24:27,99 --> 0:24:30,78
ALL AT THE SAME TIME. AND SO, ROOT SYSTEMS
HAVE


399
0:24:30,78 --> 0:24:33,59
 ATTRACTED A LOT OF INTEREST FROM PLANT MOLECULAR


400
0:24:33,59 --> 0:24:36,659
BIOLOGISTS BECAUSE ALL OF THESE EVENTS GO
ON WITHIN


401
0:24:36,659 --> 0:24:40,639
A SINGLE PLANT, A SINGLE ROOT SYSTEM. NOW
WHAT I


402
0:24:40,639 --> 0:24:45,1
WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO TAKE THIS ROOT SYSTEM,
WHICH WE


403
0:24:45,1 --> 0:24:48,6
HAVE DRAWN AND LONGITUDINAL SECTION AND TO
LOOK AT IT


404
0:24:48,6 --> 0:24:51,23
IN CROSS SECTION, TO MAKE A CROSS SECTION
OF THIS


405
0:24:51,23 --> 0:24:54,419
ROOT. YOU WILL HAVE THIS MODEL IN THE LAB,
YOU ARE


406
0:24:54,419 --> 0:24:57,539
ALSO GOING TO HAVE A MICROSCOPE SLIDES TO
ALLOW YOU TO


407
0:24:57,539 --> 0:24:59,789
LOOK AT THESE VARIOUS CELL TYPES, BUT WHAT
I WOULD


408
0:24:59,789 --> 0:25:2,59
LIKE TO DO IS TO PUT THE LANDMARKS OF THE
CELL TYPES


409
0:25:2,59 --> 0:25:5,409
ON NOW IN A DRAWING BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING
TO BE SEEING


410
0:25:5,409 --> 0:25:10,44
THEM IN THE LAB, I THINK NEXT WEEK. SO, LET'S
NOW


411
0:25:10,44 --> 0:25:15,88
BEGIN WITH A CROSS SECTION, A CROSS SECTION
OF


412
0:25:15,88 --> 0:25:24,7
A TYPICAL EUDICOT ROOT. WE ARE MAKING A CUT
ACROSS


413
0:25:24,7 --> 0:25:30,44
THE ROOT. AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH A ROUND PICTURE


414
0:25:30,44 --> 0:25:33,47
WHICH IS THE CROSS SECTION OF THE ROOT AND
LET'S START


415
0:25:33,47 --> 0:25:38,649
WITH A COUPLE OF LANDMARKS FOR OUR DISCUSSION,
IN THE


416
0:25:38,649 --> 0:25:44,34
VERY CENTER OF THE ROOT IS THE VASCULAR TISSUE,
THAT


417
0:25:44,34 --> 0:25:50,9
 IS THE XYLEM AND THE PHLOEM. VASCULAR TISSUE
WHICH WE


418
0:25:50,9 --> 0:25:54,24
TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. AND HAS VARIOUS ARRANGEMENTS
AND


419
0:25:54,24 --> 0:25:56,19
YOU WILL SEE SOME OF THE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE
SLIDES


420
0:25:56,19 --> 0:26:0,45
THAT I SHOW YOU AND ALSO IN THE LAB. AT THE
VERY


421
0:26:0,45 --> 0:26:5,159
OUTSIDE YOU HAVE THE EPIDERMIS. AND YOU MIGHT
EVEN


422
0:26:5,159 --> 0:26:12,169
HAVE A ROOT HERE.


423
0:26:12,169 --> 0:26:13,71
THE MAJOR BODY OF THE ROOT, THE


424
0:26:13,71 --> 0:26:19,649
MAJOR CELLS OF THE ROOT ARE IN THIS REGION
HERE AND


425
0:26:19,649 --> 0:26:23,6
THEY ARE THE CORTEX. THEY ARE MOSTLY PARENCHYMA


426
0:26:23,6 --> 0:26:34,9
CELLS. MOSTLY PARENCHYMA CELLS AND THEY FUNCTION
IN


427
0:26:34,9 --> 0:26:36,259
STORAGE. THAT IS WHAT MAKES UP THE BODY OF
THESE


428
0:26:36,259 --> 0:26:38,669
ROOTS, MOSTLY PARENCHYMA CELLS. THEY FUNCTION
IN


429
0:26:38,669 --> 0:26:42,59
STORAGE OF STARCH AND SUGARS. NOW WE HAVE
ONLY A TWO


430
0:26:42,59 --> 0:26:44,5
MORE REAL IMPORTANT CELL TYPES TO PUT ON HERE
FOR


431
0:26:44,5 --> 0:26:49,29
DISCUSSION TODAY. AT THIS POINT OVER HERE
THE


432
0:26:49,29 --> 0:26:57,96
INNER-MOST LAYER OF THE CORTEX, INNER MOST
LAYER OF


433
0:26:57,96 --> 0:27:1,69
THE CORTEX IS GIVEN A SPECIAL NAME. AND IT
IS GOING


434
0:27:1,69 --> 0:27:4,11
TO FIGURE PROMINENTLY IN A MOMENT WHEN WE
TALK ABOUT


435
0:27:4,11 --> 0:27:7,46
HOW ROOTS FUNCTION. THAT INNER MOST LAYER
IS CALLED


436
0:27:7,46 --> 0:27:18,12
 THE ENDODERMIS. THE ENDODERMIS.


437
0:27:18,12 --> 0:27:19,23
AND THE LAST LAYER


438
0:27:19,23 --> 0:27:25,269
WHICH I AM GOING TO PUT ON FOR YOU HERE IS
THE LAYER


439
0:27:25,269 --> 0:27:30,83
DIRECTLY INSIDE THE ENDODERMIS.


440
0:27:30,83 --> 0:27:37,919
A LAYER DIRECTLY INSIDE THE ENDODERMIS THAT
IS


441
0:27:37,919 --> 0:27:40,19
THE LAST LAYER YOU HAVE TO KNOW.


442
0:27:40,19 --> 0:27:42,97
AND THAT LAYER INDIRECTLY INSIDE THE ENDODERMIS


443
0:27:42,97 --> 0:27:55,19
IS CALLED THE PARACYCLE. NOW WHY IS THE PARACYCLE


444
0:27:55,19 --> 0:27:58,59
IMPORTANT? WHY AM I POINTING IT OUT TO YOU?
THE


445
0:27:58,59 --> 0:28:9,789
PARACYCLE IS THE SITE OF ORIGIN OF THE BRANCH
ROOT OF


446
0:28:9,789 --> 0:28:19,46
THE LATERAL BRANCH ROOTS.


447
0:28:19,46 --> 0:28:21,179
IT IS THE PLACE WHERE WE


448
0:28:21,179 --> 0:28:25,84
FIND THAT LATERALS ARE PRODUCED AND WHERE
THEY


449
0:28:25,84 --> 0:28:29,72
ORIGINATE AND THEY HAVE AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION
AS FAR


450
0:28:29,72 --> 0:28:33,379
AS INCREASING THE SURFACE AREA OF THE ROOT.
WE WILL


451
0:28:33,379 --> 0:28:36,809
TALK ABOUT THE LATERALS A LITTLE LATER ON
TODAY. NOW,


452
0:28:36,809 --> 0:28:39,279
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO SHOW YOU SOME
PICTURES


453
0:28:39,279 --> 0:28:41,97
OF THESE VARIOUS ITEMS THAT I HAVE JUST BRIEFLY


454
0:28:41,97 --> 0:28:45,85
INTRODUCED YOU TO. THE FIRST PICTURE IS GOING
TO BE


455
0:28:45,85 --> 0:28:48,97
OF A ROOT WHICH IS SORT OF IN PREPARED TWO
WAYS. ON


456
0:28:48,97 --> 0:28:51,86
 YOUR LEFT IS A LONG STUDENT SIGNAL SECTION
THROUGH THE


457
0:28:51,86 --> 0:28:55,9
ROOT, AND ON THE RIGHT IS A WHOLE ROOT, THEY
HAVE SORT


458
0:28:55,9 --> 0:28:57,919
OF BEEN PUT TOGETHER IN A SINGLE PICTURE.
HERE IS THE


459
0:28:57,919 --> 0:29:0,58
BODY OF THE ROOT, AND HERE IS THE ROOT CAP.
AND WHAT


460
0:29:0,58 --> 0:29:3,44
I WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU IS THIS SORT OF
TRANSLUCENT


461
0:29:3,44 --> 0:29:7,9
TYPE OF MATERIAL HERE. THIS IS THE LUBRICANT
WHICH


462
0:29:7,9 --> 0:29:9,799
COMES FROM THE ROOT AND FROM THE ROOT CAP,
AND WHICH


463
0:29:9,799 --> 0:29:12,69
IS USED IN HELPING THE ROOT GET THROUGH THE
SOIL.


464
0:29:12,69 --> 0:29:14,929
NOW, HERE IS THE SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE TAKEN
A CORN


465
0:29:14,929 --> 0:29:17,71
SEEDLING AND THE ROOT WAS ORIGINALLY GROWING
DOWN.


466
0:29:17,71 --> 0:29:20,909
AND WE NOW REORIENTED IT AT 90 DEGREES AND
THIS


467
0:29:20,909 --> 0:29:25,0
REPRESENTS TIME ON THIS AXIS. AND AS TIME
GOES ON YOU


468
0:29:25,0 --> 0:29:28,279
NOTICE THAT THE ROOT SYSTEM IS PRECEDING GRAVITY
AND


469
0:29:28,279 --> 0:29:31,5
AS IT IS GROWING IT IS REORIENTING WITH REGARD,
SO


470
0:29:31,5 --> 0:29:33,71
THAT ITS ORIGINAL ORIENTATION WITH REGARD
TO THE


471
0:29:33,71 --> 0:29:36,919
GRAVITY VECTOR HAS BEEN RESTORED. THIS IS
BECAUSE THE


472
0:29:36,919 --> 0:29:40,429
AMYLOPLAST NOW HAS FALLEN TO THE NEW SURFACE
AND HAS


473
0:29:40,429 --> 0:29:43,47
STARTED THE PROCESS TO THE DETECTION OF GRAVITY
AND


474
0:29:43,47 --> 0:29:46,149
 THOSE PROCESSES WHICH RESULT IN THE REORIENTATION
OF


475
0:29:46,149 --> 0:29:50,29
THE ROOT. AS A CONTRAST WITH AN EXAMPLE HERE
IN WHICH


476
0:29:50,29 --> 0:29:53,549
THE ROOT CAP IS TAKEN OFF PRIOR TO THE TIME
THE ROOT


477
0:29:53,549 --> 0:29:56,5
IS REORIENTED, IT IS THEN REORIENTED AND THE
ROOT


478
0:29:56,5 --> 0:29:59,72
CONTINUES TO GROW ALONG BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
HAVE A CAP


479
0:29:59,72 --> 0:30:4,269
NOW TO INDICATE WHERE THE GRAVITY VECTOR IS
LOCATED.


480
0:30:4,269 --> 0:30:6,539
TO GIVE YOU A SORT OF SOME CARTOONS OR BETTER
VIEWS OF


481
0:30:6,539 --> 0:30:8,94
THESE STATOCYTES, AS I SAID THERE ARE MORE
THAN TWO IN


482
0:30:8,94 --> 0:30:12,23
THE CAP. HERE ARE THE STATOCYTES. HERE ARE
THE


483
0:30:12,23 --> 0:30:15,799
AMYLOPLAST THESE ARE MEMBRANE-BOUND STARCH
GRAINS. IF


484
0:30:15,799 --> 0:30:19,8
WE CHANGE THE ORIENTATION OF THE ROOT, THAT
IS OF THE


485
0:30:19,8 --> 0:30:22,39
STATOCYTE, THEY FALL TO A NEW LOWER SURFACE
AND THAT


486
0:30:22,39 --> 0:30:24,95
IS HOW THE ROOT DETECTS THE NEW DIRECTION.
AND THIS


487
0:30:24,95 --> 0:30:27,72
IS JUST WHAT WE DRAW UP ON THE BOARD BEFORE
WHERE WE


488
0:30:27,72 --> 0:30:31,36
HAVE THE SURFACE WHICH IS HERE. WE NOW REORIENT
THE


489
0:30:31,36 --> 0:30:33,94
ROOT 90'S DEGREES AND THE STARCH GRAINS WHICH
WERE


490
0:30:33,94 --> 0:30:37,22
RESTING OR COLLECTING ON THIS SURFACE NOW
COLLECT ON


491
0:30:37,22 --> 0:30:39,2
THIS NEW LOWER SURFACE NOW AND COLLECT ON
THIS NEW


492
0:30:39,2 --> 0:30:40,659
 LOWER SURFACE AND THIS IS THE SIGNAL OR
AT LEAST THE


493
0:30:40,659 --> 0:30:44,509
BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS FOR NOTING THAT THE
GRAVITY


494
0:30:44,509 --> 0:30:47,669
VECTOR HAS CHANGED IN ITS DIRECTION. HERE
ARE SOME


495
0:30:47,669 --> 0:30:50,169
AMYLOPLAST, THE ELCTROMICROGRAPH TO SHOW WHAT
THEY


496
0:30:50,169 --> 0:30:52,37
LOOK LIKE. EACH OF THESE DARK BODIES IS A
STARCH


497
0:30:52,37 --> 0:30:54,45
GRAIN AND YOU CAN SEE THE MEMBRANE, THE


498
0:30:54,45 --> 0:30:57,74
ELECTROMICROGRAPH MEMBRANE SURROUNDING THIS
COLLECTION


499
0:30:57,74 --> 0:31:1,61
OF STARCH GRAINS, WHICH MAKES THEM VERY DENSE.
CROSS


500
0:31:1,61 --> 0:31:4,71
SECTION OF A TYPICAL DICOT ROOT, THE VASCULAR
TISSUE,


501
0:31:4,71 --> 0:31:6,44
THE XYLEM AND PHLOEM ARE IN THE MIDDLE AND
I WILL SHOW


502
0:31:6,44 --> 0:31:8,929
YOU A HIGHER POWER OF IT IN A MOMENT. MOST
OF THE


503
0:31:8,929 --> 0:31:11,84
ROOT IS MADE UP OF CORTEX AND THESE PURPLE
CELLS ARE


504
0:31:11,84 --> 0:31:14,519
DYED PURPLE BECAUSE OF THE STARCH, WHICH IS
IN THE


505
0:31:14,519 --> 0:31:17,44
CORTEX. WE HAVE THE EPIDERMIS ALONG THE OUTSIDE
AND


506
0:31:17,44 --> 0:31:19,7
NOW IF WE LOOK AT THAT CENTER PORTION WITH
A LITTLE


507
0:31:19,7 --> 0:31:23,22
MORE DETAIL THIS LAYER OF CELLS WITH THE RED
ON IT IS


508
0:31:23,22 --> 0:31:26,22
THE ENDODERMIS. AND DIRECTIONALLY INSIDE,
BY


509
0:31:26,22 --> 0:31:29,47
DEFINITION, IS THE PARACYCLE. THAT LAYER OF
CELLS IN


510
0:31:29,47 --> 0:31:32,49
 WHICH THE LATERAL ROOTS FORM. AND THIS IS
THE


511
0:31:32,49 --> 0:31:34,58
VASCULAR TISSUE. THE XYLEM AND THE PHLOEM
AND WE WILL


512
0:31:34,58 --> 0:31:36,919
TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE MORE.


513
0:31:36,919 --> 0:31:39,309
WHEN THE LATERAL ROOTS GROW OUT, THEY GROW
OUT


514
0:31:39,309 --> 0:31:42,889
IN A PATTERN, THEY HAVE TO PUSH THEIR WAY
THROUGH THE


515
0:31:42,889 --> 0:31:45,559
CORTEX. HERE IS THE PARACYCLE WHERE THEY ORIGINATE


516
0:31:45,559 --> 0:31:47,57
FROM AND THEY HAVE TO PUSH THEIR WAY THROUGH
THE


517
0:31:47,57 --> 0:31:51,34
CORTEX, ESSENTIALLY DISSOLVING THE CELL WALLS
OF THE


518
0:31:51,34 --> 0:31:54,45
CORTEX UNTIL THE LATERAL ROOT FINALLY MAKES
IT OUT TO


519
0:31:54,45 --> 0:31:57,62
THE SURFACE AND THEN BEGINS TO FUNCTION AS
A ROOT ON


520
0:31:57,62 --> 0:32:2,34
ITS OWN. OKAY. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE LANDMARKS,


521
0:32:2,34 --> 0:32:4,86
SORT OF THE GENERALIZED CHARACTERISTICS AND
ACTIVITIES


522
0:32:4,86 --> 0:32:6,24
OF ROOTS.


523
0:32:6,24 --> 0:32:8,429
NOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS SPEND THE LAST
20


524
0:32:8,429 --> 0:32:11,21
MINUTES OF TODAY TALKING TO YOU ABOUT PROBABLY
THE


525
0:32:11,21 --> 0:32:13,58
MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE ROOT. AND THAT


526
0:32:13,58 --> 0:32:16,279
IMPORTANT FUNCTION HAS TO DO WITH WATER AND
NUTRIENT


527
0:32:16,279 --> 0:32:20,109
UPTAKE. AND I WANT TO BEGIN BY SAYING A ROOT
IS


528
0:32:20,109 --> 0:32:22,59
 GROWING IN THE SOIL, LET'S TAKE THIS CARROT,
IT IS


529
0:32:22,59 --> 0:32:27,59
GROWING IN THE SOIL AND IT IS EXPOSED TO LOTS
OF


530
0:32:27,59 --> 0:32:29,769
DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE SOIL. MANY OF THE
THINGS THAT


531
0:32:29,769 --> 0:32:32,62
ARE IN THE SOIL SURROUNDING THE ROOT SYSTEM
THE CARROT


532
0:32:32,62 --> 0:32:36,19
WANTS NITROGEN, MAGNESIUM, CALCIUM, THESE
ARE ALL


533
0:32:36,19 --> 0:32:38,279
IMPORTANT ELEMENTS FOR THE CARROT TO BE ABLE
TO


534
0:32:38,279 --> 0:32:41,23
SURVIVE. BUT, THERE ARE A LOT OF TOXIC COMPOUNDS
IN


535
0:32:41,23 --> 0:32:43,45
THE SOIL. A LOT OF COMPOUNDS IN THE SOIL THAT
THE


536
0:32:43,45 --> 0:32:46,389
CARROT DOESN'T WANT. IT DOESN'T WANT SALT,
IT DOESN'T


537
0:32:46,389 --> 0:32:49,139
WANT SODIUM. SODIUM IS BAD FOR ITS SYSTEM.
SO THE


538
0:32:49,139 --> 0:32:52,389
QUESTION IS, HOW IS THIS ROOT SYSTEM ABLE
TO


539
0:32:52,389 --> 0:32:55,94
DISCRIMINATE TO FUNCTION, TO TAKE IN MINERALS
WHICH


540
0:32:55,94 --> 0:32:59,659
ARE BENEFICIAL, BUT TO EXCLUDE THOSE TOXINS
OR


541
0:32:59,659 --> 0:33:2,499
POTENTIALLY TOXIC ELEMENTS OR OTHER COMPOUNDS
IN THE


542
0:33:2,499 --> 0:33:5,58
SOIL WHICH WOULD NOT BE SUITABLE FOR THE GROWTH
OF THE


543
0:33:5,58 --> 0:33:8,83
ROOT. WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND IN ORDER
TO


544
0:33:8,83 --> 0:33:14,84
CONSIDER THIS TOPIC, I WANT TO DRAW FOR YOU
A COUPLE


545
0:33:14,84 --> 0:33:17,529
MORE LANDMARKS THAT WE WILL BE DISCUSSING
AND TO


546
0:33:17,529 --> 0:33:21,769
 MAGNIFY AND ABBREVIATED SOME WAY THE PORTION
OF THE


547
0:33:21,769 --> 0:33:23,899
ROOT THAT WE HAVE ALREADY HAD. SO, WE WILL
NOW MAKE


548
0:33:23,899 --> 0:33:27,44
ANOTHER CROSS SECTION OF A ROOT. AGAIN, BUT
WE ARE


549
0:33:27,44 --> 0:33:29,98
GOING TO DO IT IN HIGH POWER AND WE ARE GOING
TO DO IT


550
0:33:29,98 --> 0:33:33,82
ONLY WITH A FEW CELLS. ON THIS SIDE WE ARE
GOING TO


551
0:33:33,82 --> 0:33:36,47
HAVE THE VASCULAR TISSUE, IN THE VARIOUS CENTER,
SO


552
0:33:36,47 --> 0:33:43,8
THIS IS THE XYLEM AND THE PHLOEM. THEN WE
ARE GOING


553
0:33:43,8 --> 0:33:45,799
TO HAVE AS WE MOVE OUT THE CELLS THAT WE NEED
TO KNOW.


554
0:33:45,799 --> 0:33:51,659
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE ENDODERMIS AND THEN
WE ARE


555
0:33:51,659 --> 0:33:54,409
GOING TO HAVE, I WILL JUST MAKE ONE LAYER
HERE RIGHT


556
0:33:54,409 --> 0:33:59,33
NOW, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A NUMBER OF CELLS
OF THE


557
0:33:59,33 --> 0:34:5,139
CORTEX. AND THEN FINALLY, WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE THE


558
0:34:5,139 --> 0:34:10,71
EPIDERMIS.


559
0:34:10,71 --> 0:34:13,45
NOW, IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS ROOT
IS


560
0:34:13,45 --> 0:34:16,7
ABLE TO TAKE IN ONLY THOSE THINGS THAT IT
WANTS TO


561
0:34:16,7 --> 0:34:19,399
TAKE IN, AND EXCLUDE THOSE THAT IT DOESN'T
WANT, WE


562
0:34:19,399 --> 0:34:22,379
HAVE TO PUT A FEW MORE THINGS ON HERE FOR
YOU. THE


563
0:34:22,379 --> 0:34:25,29
FIRST THING THAT WE NEED TO PUT ON AND THEN
OUT HERE


564
0:34:25,29 --> 0:34:28,309
 WILL BE THE SOIL, OF COURSE, FIRST THING
WE WANT TO


565
0:34:28,309 --> 0:34:31,5
PUT ON THIS, WHICH IS IMPORTANT, IS THAT EACH
OF THESE


566
0:34:31,5 --> 0:34:46,78
CELLS WHICH MAKE UP THE ROOT HAVE A MEMBRANE.
SO,


567
0:34:46,78 --> 0:34:53,78
THIS IS A MEMBRANE. VERY IMPORTANT. AND IF
WE COULD


568
0:34:53,78 --> 0:34:56,89
LOOK WITH WITH AN ELECTROMICROGRAPH, AND I
WILL SHOW


569
0:34:56,89 --> 0:34:57,94
YOU SOME PICTURES OF THESE ELECTROMICROGRAPHS
IN


570
0:34:57,94 --> 0:35:7,67
A MOMENT, WE WOULD NOTICE THAT RUNNING BETWEEN
CELLS


571
0:35:7,67 --> 0:35:13,18
ARE TINY PORES.


572
0:35:13,18 --> 0:35:15,23
TINY PORES.


573
0:35:15,23 --> 0:35:17,64
WE CAN'T SEE THESE PORES WITH OUR EYE, WE
NEED


574
0:35:17,64 --> 0:35:19,93
AN ELECTROMICROSCOPE TO BE ABLE TO VISUALIZE
THESE


575
0:35:19,93 --> 0:35:24,839
PORES. BUT, IF YOU WERE A MOLECULE, IF YOU
WERE AN


576
0:35:24,839 --> 0:35:29,25
ATOM OR A MOLECULE OF SAY A CALCIUM, TO YOU
THESE


577
0:35:29,25 --> 0:35:32,51
PORES WOULD LOOK GIANT. THEY WOULD BE ABLE
TO, THEY


578
0:35:32,51 --> 0:35:34,22
WOULD BE LIKE FREEWAYS, YOU COULD MOVE THROUGH
THEM


579
0:35:34,22 --> 0:35:36,99
WITHOUT ANY, ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL.


580
0:35:36,99 --> 0:35:42,69
THESE PORES ARE, AS I SAID, VIEWED ONLY WITH
THE


581
0:35:42,69 --> 0:35:52,79
ELECTROMICROSCOPE AND THEY ARE CALLED PLASMODESMATA.
 AND I WILL SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF THEM VERY


582
0:35:52,79 --> 0:35:55,2
SHORTLY.


583
0:35:55,2 --> 0:35:58,67
NOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS AN EXPERIMENT.
AND IN


584
0:35:58,67 --> 0:36:1,359
THIS EXPERIMENT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS
WE ARE


585
0:36:1,359 --> 0:36:7,99
GOING TO HAVE A SOLUTION WITH WATER, DOESN'T
MAKE ANY


586
0:36:7,99 --> 0:36:10,99
DIFFERENCE, AND IN TO THIS SOLUTION OF WATER
WE ARE


587
0:36:10,99 --> 0:36:13,609
GOING TO DISSOLVE TWO COMPOUNDS. WE WILL CALL
THEM A


588
0:36:13,609 --> 0:36:22,18
AND B. A AND B. AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO PUT
A PLANT


589
0:36:22,18 --> 0:36:26,3
IN THIS WATER WITH ITS ROOT SYSTEM, IN THIS
WATER, AND


590
0:36:26,3 --> 0:36:28,88
ITS GOING TO SIT IN THERE AND WE ARE GOING
TO ALLOW


591
0:36:28,88 --> 0:36:36,47
FOR SOME TIME TO PASS. ALLOW FOR SOME TIME
TO PASS.


592
0:36:36,47 --> 0:36:39,4
SO HERE WE HAVE THIS PLANT SITTING IN THE
WATER


593
0:36:39,4 --> 0:36:43,23
WHICH HAS A AND B IN IT. AND NOW SOME TIME
HAS PASSED


594
0:36:43,23 --> 0:36:47,79
AND WE ARE GOING TO ASK WHAT IS HAPPENED TO
A AND B.


595
0:36:47,79 --> 0:36:49,75
WHERE ARE THEY? WHERE DID THEY GO INTO THIS


596
0:36:49,75 --> 0:36:53,54
PARTICULAR PLANT? LET'S SAY FOR THIS EXAMPLE
WHAT WE


597
0:36:53,54 --> 0:36:58,77
FIND IS THAT A MAKES IT ALL OF THE WAY TO
THE TOP OF


598
0:36:58,77 --> 0:37:4,99
THE PLANT. IF WE LOOK FOR B WHERE DID B GO,
B IS


599
0:37:4,99 --> 0:37:11,24
CONFINED. IT APPEARS TO BE CONFINED TO THE
ROOT


600
0:37:11,24 --> 0:37:11,64
 SYSTEM.


601
0:37:11,64 --> 0:37:20,52
IT IS CONFINED TO THE ROOT SYSTEM.


602
0:37:20,52 --> 0:37:23,599
NOW, IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THIS A LITTLE MORE


603
0:37:23,599 --> 0:37:26,38
CAREFULLY TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE ROOT
SYSTEM,


604
0:37:26,38 --> 0:37:31,569
I AM GOING TO DRAW THIS AGAIN. NOT QUITE AS
DETAILED,


605
0:37:31,569 --> 0:37:33,91
BUT I AM GOING TO PUT SEVERAL LAYERS ON THIS
ONE FOR


606
0:37:33,91 --> 0:37:37,98
YOU. SO, WE WILL START OUT AGAIN WITH THE
VASCULAR


607
0:37:37,98 --> 0:37:42,22
TISSUE AND NOW WE HAVE SEVERAL LAYERS OF ENDODERMIS


608
0:37:42,22 --> 0:37:48,18
AND NOW I AM GOING TO PUT ON SEVERAL LAYERS
OF CORTEX.


609
0:37:48,18 --> 0:37:51,89
AND THE EPIDERMIS. HERE IS ANOTHER EPIDERMAL
CELL.


610
0:37:51,89 --> 0:37:53,23
SO IT IS THE SAME THING YOU SAW BEFORE. NOW
I AM GOING


611
0:37:53,23 --> 0:37:58,829
TO PUT SEVERAL LAYERS OF CELLS ON. LIKE SO.


612
0:37:58,829 --> 0:38:5,2
SAME THING, THIS IS A CROSS SECTION OF A ROOT.


613
0:38:5,2 --> 0:38:8,42
AND NOW LET'S LOOK TO SEE WHERE A AND B ARE
IN THIS


614
0:38:8,42 --> 0:38:12,66
PARTICULAR ROOT, IN WHICH THAT PLANT HAS SHOWN
US THAT


615
0:38:12,66 --> 0:38:16,3
A HAS GOTTEN ALL OF THE WAY TO THE TOP. IF
WE LOOK TO


616
0:38:16,3 --> 0:38:22,349
SEE WHERE A IS, WE FIND THAT A IS INSIDE THE
CELL OF


617
0:38:22,349 --> 0:38:28,92
THE EPIDERMIS INSIDE ALL OF THE CORTEX CELLS.
INSIDE


618
0:38:28,92 --> 0:38:33,75
 THE ENDODERMIS AND HAS MADE IT TO THE INSIDE
OF THE


619
0:38:33,75 --> 0:38:36,869
VASCULAR TISSUE. THAT SEEMS LOGICAL BECAUSE
A IS


620
0:38:36,869 --> 0:38:44,619
CLEAR UP AT THE TOP OF THE PLANT. THIS PATHWAY
THAT A


621
0:38:44,619 --> 0:38:50,22
HAS TAKEN, THIS PATHWAY THAT A HAS TAKEN IN
ORDER, WE


622
0:38:50,22 --> 0:39:2,16
ARE WRITING THIS DOWN TO YOU, THIS PATHWAY
OF A


623
0:39:2,16 --> 0:39:15,95
INVOLVES CROSSING A MEMBRANE.


624
0:39:15,95 --> 0:39:17,619
SO, LET'S GO BACK TO


625
0:39:17,619 --> 0:39:20,7
THIS BIG PICTURE THAT I DREW OVER HERE AND
IN ORDER


626
0:39:20,7 --> 0:39:25,109
FOR A TO GET INSIDE OF THIS CELL IT HAD TO
CROSS THE


627
0:39:25,109 --> 0:39:30,25
MEMBRANE. THIS IS THE CRITICAL PART OF WHEN
THE PLANT


628
0:39:30,25 --> 0:39:36,79
DECIDES TO MAKE A CHOICE. IF IT ALLOWS A TO
CROSS THE


629
0:39:36,79 --> 0:39:39,16
MEMBRANE ITS MAKING A CHOICE. IT IS SAYING,
I WANT


630
0:39:39,16 --> 0:39:41,45
YOU A, I WANT YOU TO COME IN, WHATEVER YOU
HAPPEN TO


631
0:39:41,45 --> 0:39:47,77
BE. ONCE A ENTERS THOUGH, KEEP IN MIND IT
NOW HAS


632
0:39:47,77 --> 0:39:52,359
FREE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE CELLS THROUGH THE
PORES.


633
0:39:52,359 --> 0:39:55,41
FREE ACCESS AND IT CAN GO ALL OF THE WAY TO
THE


634
0:39:55,41 --> 0:39:58,579
CENTRAL PORTION BY PASSING THROUGH THE PORES.
ANY


635
0:39:58,579 --> 0:40:2,819
QUESTIONS ON THAT? AN IMPORTANT POINT.


636
0:40:2,819 --> 0:40:26,79
THIS PATHWAY, THIS PATHWAY WHICH IS INSIDE
 A MEMBRANE, IS KNOWN AS THE SYMPLAST OR


637
0:40:26,79 --> 0:40:28,69
THE SYMPLASTIC


638
0:40:28,69 --> 0:40:34,89
PATHWAY.


639
0:40:34,89 --> 0:40:37,819
SYMPLASTIC PATHWAY.


640
0:40:37,819 --> 0:40:50,5
ONCE AN ION ENTERS A SYMPLASTIC PATHWAY, THIS


641
0:40:50,5 --> 0:41:8,99
PATHWAY, IT HAS ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE PLANT.


642
0:41:8,99 --> 0:41:11,819
NOTICE THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO CROSS THE


643
0:41:11,819 --> 0:41:14,75
MEMBRANE HERE, IT CAN CROSS THE MEMBRANE OVER
HERE,


644
0:41:14,75 --> 0:41:17,119
BUT WHENEVER IT CROSSES A MEMBRANE, ONCE IT
GETS


645
0:41:17,119 --> 0:41:20,319
ACROSS IT HAS ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE PLANT.
THAT IS AN


646
0:41:20,319 --> 0:41:23,38
IMPORTANT PATHWAY. NOW, LET'S LOOK TO SEE
WHAT


647
0:41:23,38 --> 0:41:26,5
HAPPENED WITH B. WE SAID B DIDN'T MAKE IT
UP TO THE


648
0:41:26,5 --> 0:41:29,49
TOP OF THE PLANT. LET'S SEE WHERE B IS IN
THE ROOT


649
0:41:29,49 --> 0:41:34,53
THOUGH. IF WE FOLLOW B WHAT WE FIND IS THAT
B IS


650
0:41:34,53 --> 0:41:38,66
LOCATED IN THESE SPACES BETWEEN CELLS. THESE
SPACES


651
0:41:38,66 --> 0:41:47,67
ARE KNOWN AS INTERCELLULAR SPACES.


652
0:41:47,67 --> 0:41:48,42
AND IF WE HAD A


653
0:41:48,42 --> 0:41:51,799
ELECTROMICROSCOPE WE WOULD ALSO FIND THAT
B IS IN THE


654
0:41:51,799 --> 0:42:0,38
CELL WALL. IT IS IN THE CELL WALL. B IS IN
THE CELL


655
0:42:0,38 --> 0:42:4,15
WALL. TO US THE CELL WALL MAY SEEM TO BE VERY
SOLID.


656
0:42:4,15 --> 0:42:7,41
BUT, TO A SMALL MOLECULE THE CELL WALL IS
A MESH. IT


657
0:42:7,41 --> 0:42:10,619
 HAS LOTS OF SPACES AND PORES INSIDE OF IT.
AND IF WE


658
0:42:10,619 --> 0:42:14,799
FOLLOW B WE FIND THAT IT IS IN THE CELL WALLS,
IT IS


659
0:42:14,799 --> 0:42:19,69
IN THE INTRACELLULAR SPACES, IT GETS ALL OF
THE WAY TO


660
0:42:19,69 --> 0:42:22,25
THE ENDODERMIS IN THE ROOT SYSTEM. ALL OF
THE WAY TO


661
0:42:22,25 --> 0:42:26,43
THE ENDODERMIS. AND THEN IT IS STOPPED. IT
CANNOT GO


662
0:42:26,43 --> 0:42:36,339
ANY FURTHER.


663
0:42:36,339 --> 0:42:39,77
THE PATHWAY WHICH INVOLVES THE INTRACELLULAR


664
0:42:39,77 --> 0:42:44,579
SPACES AND THE CELL WALLS DOES NOT INVOLVE
CROSSING


665
0:42:44,579 --> 0:42:53,42
ANY MEMBRANES SO THE PATHWAY INVOLVING INTRACELLULAR


666
0:42:53,42 --> 0:43:9,51
SPACES IS NOT INVOLVED IN CROSSING A MEMBRANE.


667
0:43:9,51 --> 0:43:19,22
SO, WE GIVE A SEPARATE NAME TO THIS SECOND


668
0:43:19,22 --> 0:43:22,619
PATHWAY, WHICH INCLUDES THE INTRACELLULAR
SPACES AND


669
0:43:22,619 --> 0:43:27,96
THE CELL WALL. WE CALL THIS THE APPLEPLAST
OR THE


670
0:43:27,96 --> 0:43:36,79
APPLEPLASTIC PATHWAY.


671
0:43:36,79 --> 0:43:39,66
SO, THE PLANT DIDN'T WANT B, IT


672
0:43:39,66 --> 0:43:43,19
DECIDED NOT TO ALLOW B TO CROSS THE MEMBRANE.
BUT, B


673
0:43:43,19 --> 0:43:48,359
WAS ABLE TO FUSE INTO THE ROOT SYSTEM, TO
A CERTAIN


674
0:43:48,359 --> 0:43:53,569
POINT, THEN IT WAS STOPPED. AND THIS IS THE
SECRET OF


675
0:43:53,569 --> 0:43:57,28
HOW THE PLANT WORKS. BECAUSE THIS SPECIAL
LAYER HERE,


676
0:43:57,28 --> 0:44:1,299
 THE ENDODERMIS, WHICH I POINTED OUT TO YOU
BEFORE HAS


677
0:44:1,299 --> 0:44:5,66
A PARTICULAR FEATURE WHICH STOPS ANYTHING
FROM MOVING


678
0:44:5,66 --> 0:44:9,559
FURTHER INTO THE ROOT UNLESS THAT THING IS
IN THE


679
0:44:9,559 --> 0:44:14,59
SYMPLAST. IT ESSENTIALLY IS THE GATE FOR THE
APPLE


680
0:44:14,59 --> 0:44:18,13
PLAST. AND HOW DOES THE ENDODERMIS WORK?


681
0:44:18,13 --> 0:44:21,45
I HAVE HERE A CARDBOARD BOX WHICH IS MEANT
TO


682
0:44:21,45 --> 0:44:25,38
SORT OF ILLUSTRATE FOR YOU AN ENDODERMAL CELL.
AND


683
0:44:25,38 --> 0:44:29,28
YOU NOTICE ON THIS CARDBOARD BOX, THAT I HAVE
THIS RED


684
0:44:29,28 --> 0:44:32,24
CIRCLE GOING AROUND. THIS RED CIRCLE, ASSUME
THE


685
0:44:32,24 --> 0:44:35,15
CARDBOARD BOX REPRESENTS THE WALL OF THE EPIDERMAL


686
0:44:35,15 --> 0:44:40,119
CELL, AND THIS RED MATERIAL EXTENDS INTO THE
WALL AND


687
0:44:40,119 --> 0:44:43,38
IT EXTENDS INTO THE INSIDE, IT GOES THROUGH
THE WALL.


688
0:44:43,38 --> 0:44:46,4
WHAT IS THIS RED MATERIAL? WHAT DOES THIS
RED


689
0:44:46,4 --> 0:44:49,7
MATERIAL FUNCTION AS? THIS RED MATERIAL IS
CALLED


690
0:44:49,7 --> 0:44:56,78
SUBERIN. IT IS THE SAME MATERIAL WHICH MAKES
CORK


691
0:44:56,78 --> 0:45:5,4
FLOAT. IT IS WATER IMPERVIOUS.


692
0:45:5,4 --> 0:45:6,97
WATER IMPERVIOUS.


693
0:45:6,97 --> 0:45:11,94
THAT IS, BECAUSE IT IS WATER IMPERVIOUS AS
SOMETHING


694
0:45:11,94 --> 0:45:14,89
IN THE APPLE PLASTIC PATHWAY IS MOVING THROUGH
THE


695
0:45:14,89 --> 0:45:20,869
 CELL WALL IN A WATER SOLUTION, ONCE IT ENCOUNTERS
THIS


696
0:45:20,869 --> 0:45:24,77
SUBERIN LAYER IT CAN'T GO ANY FURTHER. IT
CAN'T REACH


697
0:45:24,77 --> 0:45:29,619
THE SITE OF THE CELL WALL BECAUSE OF THE BLOCKAGE.


698
0:45:29,619 --> 0:45:38,559
THIS SUBERIN LAYER IS CALLED THE CASPERIAN
STRIP.
YOU


699
0:45:38,559 --> 0:45:43,15
MIGHT SAY, OKAY, WELL, IT CAN'T GO THROUGH
THIS WALL


700
0:45:43,15 --> 0:45:45,14
ANY MORE, IT CAN'T GO THROUGH THE APPLE PLAST
ANY


701
0:45:45,14 --> 0:45:47,22
MORE. WHY CAN'T IT JUST GO AROUND IT, WHY
CAN'T IT


702
0:45:47,22 --> 0:45:50,599
JUST GO THROUGH THE CELL AND WIND UP ON THIS
SIDE OVER


703
0:45:50,599 --> 0:45:53,839
HERE? LET'S PRETEND LIKE THIS BALLOON REPRESENTS
THE


704
0:45:53,839 --> 0:45:57,77
MEMBRANE SYSTEM OF THE ENDODERMAL CELL. THIS
MEMBRANE


705
0:45:57,77 --> 0:46:2,53
SYSTEM IS TIGHTLY OPPRESSED ON ALL SIDES TO
THE


706
0:46:2,53 --> 0:46:5,339
CASPERIAN STRIP INSIDE. IT IS RIGHT NEXT TO
IT. SO


707
0:46:5,339 --> 0:46:9,19
THERE IS NO SPACE BETWEEN IT AND THE CELL
WALL. SO,


708
0:46:9,19 --> 0:46:14,17
IF AN ION WANTS TO ENTER WHERE I AM, FROM
WHERE YOU


709
0:46:14,17 --> 0:46:18,89
ARE, IT CAN'T SQUEEZE THROUGH THE CELL WALL.
IT CAN'T


710
0:46:18,89 --> 0:46:21,2
SQUEEZE THROUGH THE SPACES BETWEEN THE MEMBRANE
AND


711
0:46:21,2 --> 0:46:25,49
THE CASPERIAN STRIP. THE ONLY WAY IT CAN ENTER
IS BY


712
0:46:25,49 --> 0:46:30,72
NOW PASSING ACROSS THE MEMBRANE.
 ONCE IT IS ACROSS THE MEMBRANE, IT IS NOW


713
0:46:30,72 --> 0:46:31,49
IN THE


714
0:46:31,49 --> 0:46:34,53
SYMPLAST AND IT IS HOME FREE. AT THIS POINT
THE


715
0:46:34,53 --> 0:46:37,47
PLANT, THOUGH, HAS STOPPED B FROM GOING IN
BY


716
0:46:37,47 --> 0:46:41,49
PREVENTING IT FROM SQUEEZING THROUGH BETWEEN
THE


717
0:46:41,49 --> 0:46:44,92
MEMBRANE AND THE CELL WALL OR BY CONTINUING
MOVEMENT


718
0:46:44,92 --> 0:46:47,95
IN THE APPLE PLAST OF THIS CELL WALL. AND
TO GIVE YOU


719
0:46:47,95 --> 0:46:51,45
SORT OF A BETTER EXAMPLE OF THIS, IT IS HARD
BECAUSE I


720
0:46:51,45 --> 0:46:53,78
AM ASKING YOU TO THINK 3 DIMENSIONALLY HAVE
THESE 3


721
0:46:53,78 --> 0:46:57,609
XEROX BOXES AND I WANT TO PRETEND LIKE THESE
ARE TWO


722
0:46:57,609 --> 0:47:0,299
ENDODERMAL CELLS AND YOU SHOULD REALIZE THAT
IF I AM


723
0:47:0,299 --> 0:47:3,819
THE VASCULAR TISSUE THEY EXTEND ALL OF THE
WAY AROUND


724
0:47:3,819 --> 0:47:5,69
AND ALL OF THE WAY UP, BUT I CAN'T GO TOO
FAR UP OKAY,


725
0:47:5,69 --> 0:47:9,14
SO THEY EXTEND ALL OF THE WAY AROUND. THE
CASPERIAN


726
0:47:9,14 --> 0:47:13,109
STRIP IS REPRESENTED BY THE RED. AND THE CELLS
ARE


727
0:47:13,109 --> 0:47:15,72
TIGHTLY GLUED TOGETHER WHERE INDIVIDUAL CELLS
COME IN


728
0:47:15,72 --> 0:47:18,21
CONTACT. SO THERE IS NO WAY OF GETTING BETWEEN
THE


729
0:47:18,21 --> 0:47:21,88
CELLS INSIDE WHERE I AM. THIS BUBBLE WRAP
IS MEANT TO


730
0:47:21,88 --> 0:47:25,21
REPRESENT ONE OF THE MEMBRANES BETWEEN THE
CELLS. SO


731
0:47:25,21 --> 0:47:27,66
 THERE WOULD BE CORTICAL CELLS OUT IN THE
AUDIENCE OUT


732
0:47:27,66 --> 0:47:30,39
WHERE YOU ARE AND THE BLUE REPRESENT THE


733
0:47:30,39 --> 0:47:33,789
PLASMODESMATA, THE PORES. SO, ONCE YOU ARE
INSIDE THE


734
0:47:33,789 --> 0:47:37,88
SYMPLAST YOU ARE ABLE THEN, TO MOVE WHERE
I AM IN THE


735
0:47:37,88 --> 0:47:41,809
VASCULAR TISSUE. AND IF YOU WERE IN THE SYMPLAST
AND


736
0:47:41,809 --> 0:47:44,569
YOU MADE IT THROUGH THIS PARTICULAR MEMBRANE
AND LET'S


737
0:47:44,569 --> 0:47:47,59
SAY NOW YOU WERE INSIDE THE ENDODERMAL CELL,
WHAT


738
0:47:47,59 --> 0:47:49,74
WOULD YOU SEE? IF YOU WERE INSIDE THE ENDODERMAL


739
0:47:49,74 --> 0:47:51,569
CELL SAY YOU ARE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS
CELL


740
0:47:51,569 --> 0:47:54,67
HERE, YOU WOULD LOOK UP, AND DOWN, TO THE
SIDE AND


741
0:47:54,67 --> 0:47:57,28
AROUND. YOU WOULD SEE THE CASPERIAN STRIP.
BUT YOU


742
0:47:57,28 --> 0:47:59,9
WOULDN'T CARE BECAUSE YOU ARE ALREADY IN THE
SYMPLAST


743
0:47:59,9 --> 0:48:3,39
IN THE CASPERIAN STRIP IS A LONG THE OUTSIDE.
THE


744
0:48:3,39 --> 0:48:6,95
CASPERIAN TRIP IS NOT A CURTAIN, IT IS ONLY
IMBEDDED


745
0:48:6,95 --> 0:48:10,539
IN THE CELL WALL AND THE PROTOPLAST OR THE
MEMBRANE IS


746
0:48:10,539 --> 0:48:15,349
WHAT PREVENTS MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE CELL WALL
AND THE


747
0:48:15,349 --> 0:48:18,51
SYMPLAST, BECAUSE IT IS DIRECTLY AGAINST THE
CASPERIAN


748
0:48:18,51 --> 0:48:21,57
STRIP. SO MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS IN THE BOOK.
IT IS


749
0:48:21,57 --> 0:48:23,97
 AN IMPORTANT POINT AND I KNOW THAT I AM
ASKING YOU TO


750
0:48:23,97 --> 0:48:28,5
THINK 3 DIMENSION ALLEY ABOUT THIS. LET ME
NOW SHOW


751
0:48:28,5 --> 0:48:32,64
YOU A FEW PICTURES OF THIS TO HELP YOU PUT
IT IN TO


752
0:48:32,64 --> 0:48:35,97
CONTEXT AS FAR AS 3 DIMENSIONS. I REALIZE
IT IS HARD.


753
0:48:35,97 --> 0:48:37,68
HERE IS THE CROSS SECTION OF THE ROOT JUST
AS WE


754
0:48:37,68 --> 0:48:42,2
LOOKED AT BEFORE. HERE WOULD BE THE CORTEX
AND WHAT I


755
0:48:42,2 --> 0:48:44,289
WANT TO POINT OUT TO THE CORTEX, HERE ARE
THE INTRA


756
0:48:44,289 --> 0:48:48,94
CELLULAR SPACES BETWEEN ADJACENT CORTICAL
CELLS. SO,


757
0:48:48,94 --> 0:48:52,559
IN THE APPLE PLASTIC PATHWAY, AND ION COULD
MOVE ALL


758
0:48:52,559 --> 0:48:54,3
OF THE WAY THROUGH THE CELL WALLS AND INTO


759
0:48:54,3 --> 0:48:56,96
INTRACELLULAR SPACES. UP TO THIS POINT HERE,
WHERE IT


760
0:48:56,96 --> 0:48:59,72
WOULD ENCOUNTER THE CASPERIAN STRIP. ONCE
IT GOT


761
0:48:59,72 --> 0:49:2,109
INSIDE THE CELL THOUGH, JUST LIKE I DREW THOSE
LITTLE


762
0:49:2,109 --> 0:49:5,39
BLUE DOTS, THESE ARE THE PLASMODESMATA. THESE
ARE THE


763
0:49:5,39 --> 0:49:8,21
PORES THAT YOU WOULD SEE IF YOU WERE MOVING
THROUGH


764
0:49:8,21 --> 0:49:12,16
FROM ONE CELL TO ANOTHER. NOW, I WANT TO JUST
POINT


765
0:49:12,16 --> 0:49:15,69
OUT TO YOU THE CASPERIAN STRIP AGAIN AND ITS
LOCATION


766
0:49:15,69 --> 0:49:18,869
AROUND THIS HERE. IF YOU WERE A CELL MOVING,
AN ION


767
0:49:18,869 --> 0:49:22,64
 MOVING IN, THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD SEE. HERE
IS THE


768
0:49:22,64 --> 0:49:24,829
ENDODERMIS, AND HERE IS THE CASPERIAN STRIP
ALL OF THE


769
0:49:24,829 --> 0:49:27,64
WAY AROUND. IF YOU WERE IN THE SYMPLAST YOU
COULD


770
0:49:27,64 --> 0:49:31,539
MOVE DIRECTLY THROUGH FROM THE CORTEX TO THE
CENTRAL


771
0:49:31,539 --> 0:49:34,71
CYLINDER TO THE VASCULAR TISSUE. BUT YOU NEED
TO BE


772
0:49:34,71 --> 0:49:37,619
IN THE SYMPLAST. AND THE SLIDE THAT WILL TAKE
THIS


773
0:49:37,619 --> 0:49:40,579
HOME AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU LOOK AT IT,
IF NOT


774
0:49:40,579 --> 0:49:43,349
HERE, IN YOUR TEXT BOOK, THE SLIDE WHICH WILL
TAKE IT


775
0:49:43,349 --> 0:49:45,63
HOME IS THE SUMMARY SLIDE SHOWING YOU THE
TWO


776
0:49:45,63 --> 0:49:49,22
PATHWAYS. THE APPLEPLASTIC PATHWAY IN WHICH
THE ION


777
0:49:49,22 --> 0:49:52,13
IS STOPPED, HAVING TRAVELED THROUGH THE CELL
WALL AND


778
0:49:52,13 --> 0:49:55,2
INTO INTRACELLULAR SPACE. AND THIS SYMPLASTIC
PATHWAY


779
0:49:55,2 --> 0:49:57,49
WHERE THE ION HAS CROSSED THE MEMBRANE IN
THIS


780
0:49:57,49 --> 0:49:59,96
PARTICULAR CASE, CROSSED IT AT THE ROOT HERE.
ONCE


781
0:49:59,96 --> 0:50:2,859
HAVING CROSSED THE MEMBRANE, IT IS IN THE
SYMPLAST AND


782
0:50:2,859 --> 0:50:5,5
CAN MAKE IT ALL OF THE WAY TO THE VASCULAR
TISSUE.


783
0:50:5,5 --> 0:50:7,859
MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THIS FUNCTIONS.
IT IS AN


784
0:50:7,859 --> 0:52:7,859
IMPORTANT WAY THE ROOT WORKS.
