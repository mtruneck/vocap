you wanted to do


3
0:0:3,9 --> 0:0:3,99
something with octopus?


4
0:0:3,99 --> 0:0:5,45
[MUSIC PLAYING]


5
0:0:5,45 --> 0:0:7,7
MICHAEL WHITE: We'll
make a little ragu.


6
0:0:7,7 --> 0:0:9,13
It smells just like the sea.


7
0:0:9,13 --> 0:0:11,69
But this is the whole edible
part of the octopi.


8
0:0:11,69 --> 0:0:14,17
We can use all of this.


9
0:0:14,17 --> 0:0:16,872
We'll break it for a bit and
then we'll grill it.


10
0:0:16,872 --> 0:0:20,0



11
0:0:20,0 --> 0:0:22,27
When we're doing the octopus
with bone marrow, instead of


12
0:0:22,27 --> 0:0:24,91
putting olive oil in, we put
the piped bone marrow.


13
0:0:24,91 --> 0:0:27,805
This is what we put inside the
fusilli with bone marrow when


14
0:0:27,805 --> 0:0:31,32
we toss it with tomato sauce,
and the braising liquid of


15
0:0:31,32 --> 0:0:33,91
octopus and red wine, until
that unctuous, really


16
0:0:33,91 --> 0:0:37,84
delicate, rich flavor
comes out.


17
0:0:37,84 --> 0:0:40,45
This dish is like, you know
Jimmy Buffett has to sing


18
0:0:40,45 --> 0:0:43,16
"Cheeseburger in Paradise"
at every concert?


19
0:0:43,16 --> 0:0:44,34
This is the equivalent.


20
0:0:44,34 --> 0:0:47,44
But that's a good
thing to have.


21
0:0:47,44 --> 0:0:50,12
People use the word "chef"
very, very lightly.


22
0:0:50,12 --> 0:0:52,79
When people come up to me and
say, you know my husband he's


23
0:0:52,79 --> 0:0:53,72
a great chef.


24
0:0:53,72 --> 0:0:54,72
I say, really?


25
0:0:54,72 --> 0:0:55,91
I said, where does he work?


26
0:0:55,91 --> 0:0:58,88
No, no, no, he's in finance,
but he's a great chef.


27
0:0:58,88 --> 0:1:4,3
So he's probably a great home
cook and I'd love to go eat


28
0:1:4,3 --> 0:1:5,848
dinner with him, but
he's not a chef.


29
0:1:5,848 --> 0:1:7,514

what a chef is.

MICHAEL WHITE: My name is Chef
Michael White, and I'm the


33
0:1:19,38 --> 0:1:21,59
chef-owner of Marea
in Columbus Circle


34
0:1:21,59 --> 0:1:23,13
here in New York City.


35
0:1:23,13 --> 0:1:28,47



36
0:1:28,47 --> 0:1:31,82
Marea is known for
Italian cooking.


37
0:1:31,82 --> 0:1:35,83
Marea had become synonymous
for a couple of dishes.


38
0:1:35,83 --> 0:1:41,29
Whether it's a sea urchin
crostini with lardo, actually


39
0:1:41,29 --> 0:1:44,44
the grilled octopus with
the salsa tonnata.


40
0:1:44,44 --> 0:1:47,14
Italy is surrounded by the
Mediterranean and the Adriatic


41
0:1:47,14 --> 0:1:51,84
Sea and the Ionian Sea, so
we do lots of fish here.


42
0:1:51,84 --> 0:1:54,57
It also has quite
a few pastas.


43
0:1:54,57 --> 0:1:57,31
Italian restaurants are
judged upon pastas.


44
0:1:57,31 --> 0:1:59,225
You could cook the greatest veal
chop in the world, but


45
0:1:59,225 --> 0:2:0,97
people come here for pasta.


46
0:2:0,97 --> 0:2:3,97
I got interested in Italian
cooking because Italian food


47
0:2:3,97 --> 0:2:6,41
in the Midwest, where
I grew up, was the


48
0:2:6,41 --> 0:2:7,83
ethnic food of choice.


49
0:2:7,83 --> 0:2:11,17
It was usually going to
Domenico's, which was a local


50
0:2:11,17 --> 0:2:13,74
Italian restaurant in the
city, Beloit, Wisconsin.


51
0:2:13,74 --> 0:2:15,32
So that's kind of how
I caught the bug.


52
0:2:15,32 --> 0:2:17,59
And I had a football injury.


53
0:2:17,59 --> 0:2:21,5
In rehab I was watching a bit of
TV and "Great Chefs" was on


54
0:2:21,5 --> 0:2:24,17
the Discovery Channel back in
the day, those first shows.


55
0:2:24,17 --> 0:2:29,46
And I knew that was what
I wanted to do.


56
0:2:29,46 --> 0:2:32,59
The camaraderie in working with
all the people in the


57
0:2:32,59 --> 0:2:33,89
kitchen, it really drives
you every day.


58
0:2:33,89 --> 0:2:38,44
It's a ginormous team that's
always working together.


59
0:2:38,44 --> 0:2:41,55
There's 138 people that
work at Marea.


60
0:2:41,55 --> 0:2:45,49
We have wonderful line cooks,
garde manger people.


61
0:2:45,49 --> 0:2:50,17
It's really all those people
working together that watch

to the pass every night.

We're very fortunate to be a
popular restaurant here.


67
0:3:2,93 --> 0:3:6,48
I'm dealing with very, very high
end people that make the

it's dignitaries,

whether it's the Clintons.

At the same time, I get young
people that are in the

72
0:3:14,95 --> 0:3:18,79

about being a chef is that you

0:7:34,47 --> 0:7:35,78
It's a high wire act.


203
0:7:35,78 --> 0:7:37,476
If you go a little bit
too much in one


204
0:7:37,476 --> 0:7:40,74
direction, it's ludicrous.


205
0:7:40,74 --> 0:7:43,18
MICHAEL WHITE: We were on our
12th dish at SriPraPhai, and


206
0:7:43,18 --> 0:7:46,42
there was some pre-talk about
eating some lamb kebabs.


207
0:7:46,42 --> 0:7:48,3
I'm really glad we went
to the pudding place.


208
0:7:48,3 --> 0:7:52,19



209
0:7:52,19 --> 0:7:54,63
JOSH OZERSKY: I can't eat hot
food in the outdoors.


210
0:7:54,63 --> 0:7:56,39
JOSH CAPON: I am praying to God
I'll be able to make it to


211
0:7:56,39 --> 0:7:58,8
the pudding place.


212
0:7:58,8 --> 0:7:59,52
MICHAEL WHITE: What's the
worst that can happen?


213
0:7:59,52 --> 0:8:1,135
You're just going to pass out.


214
0:8:1,135 --> 0:8:1,88

an accident.


216
0:8:2,94 --> 0:8:4,11
JOSH CAPON: I might
have an accident.


217
0:8:4,11 --> 0:8:4,37
MICHAEL WHITE: OK, listen.


218
0:8:4,37 --> 0:8:5,722
Let's talk about
pudding because


219
0:8:5,722 --> 0:8:7,11
pudding is our next stop.


220
0:8:7,11 --> 0:8:8,71
JOSH CAPON: Have
you been there?


221
0:8:8,71 --> 0:8:10,686
JOSH OZERSKY: No, I fucking read
about it in a book once.


222
0:8:10,686 --> 0:8:12,342
No of course, it's a block
from my house.


223
0:8:12,342 --> 0:8:12,815
JOSH CAPON: So the
question is--


224
0:8:12,815 --> 0:8:15,541
JOSH OZERSKY: Do you
know who I am?


225
0:8:15,541 --> 0:8:16,972
MICHAEL WHITE: Hey this
is a serious decision.


226
0:8:16,972 --> 0:8:18,403
JOSH OZERSKY: Don't
take this lightly.


227
0:8:18,403 --> 0:8:21,81
JOSH CAPON: A regular chocolate,
a regular vanilla,


228
0:8:21,81 --> 0:8:24,3
a regular banana, a regular
butterscotch--


229
0:8:24,3 --> 0:8:25,92
JOSH OZERSKY: And how
about a small lemon?


230
0:8:25,92 --> 0:8:27,283
JOSH CAPON: A small lemon.


231
0:8:27,283 --> 0:8:28,189
OLIVIA YOUNG: And can we
get salted caramel


232
0:8:28,189 --> 0:8:29,95
sauce on the side?


233
0:8:29,95 --> 0:8:29,55
JOSH OZERSKY: Why don't you
get chicken one of those?


234
0:8:29,55 --> 0:8:30,94
MICHAEL WHITE: Aaahhh!


235
0:8:30,94 --> 0:8:31,407
JOSH CAPON: Oh, I'm sorry.


236
0:8:31,407 --> 0:8:33,275
Wait a minute.


237
0:8:33,275 --> 0:8:35,61
Let's change the banana
coconut--


238
0:8:35,61 --> 0:8:38,44
MICHAEL WHITE: Listen, Josh was
fucking crazy last night.


239
0:8:38,44 --> 0:8:40,19
Josh went crazy in
there, seeing as


240
0:8:40,19 --> 0:8:41,25
though he has no neck.


241
0:8:41,25 --> 0:8:43,151
I mean, like now we know why.


242
0:8:43,151 --> 0:8:44,444
JOSH CAPON: It's not pie.


243
0:8:44,444 --> 0:8:45,31
OLIVIA YOUNG: What?


244
0:8:45,31 --> 0:8:46,39
JOSH OZERSKY: Are you
out of your mind?


245
0:8:46,39 --> 0:8:48,62
Are you on peyote
or something?


246
0:8:48,62 --> 0:8:50,372
[LAUGHTER]


247
0:8:50,372 --> 0:8:52,154
MICHAEL WHITE: Time out!


248
0:8:52,154 --> 0:8:53,9
Out of control.


249
0:8:53,9 --> 0:8:53,93
Out of control!


250
0:8:53,93 --> 0:8:55,878
JOSH OZERSKY: He's lost it.


251
0:8:55,878 --> 0:8:59,774
Someone's gonna pull your
card, my friend.


252
0:8:59,774 --> 0:9:2,21
Someone's gonna pull
your card.


253
0:9:2,21 --> 0:9:3,28
MICHAEL WHITE: The pudding
that we had was


254
0:9:3,28 --> 0:9:3,876
off the hook, though.


255
0:9:3,876 --> 0:9:6,43
You know how when your mom used
to make pudding and that


256
0:9:6,43 --> 0:9:9,18
scum went across the top
and you knew that


257
0:9:9,18 --> 0:9:11,958
it was cooked pudding?


258
0:9:11,958 --> 0:9:13,416
JOSH OZERSKY: That's
really good.


259
0:9:13,416 --> 0:9:16,82
That's fantastic.


260
0:9:16,82 --> 0:9:18,7
MICHAEL WHITE: Which
one is this?


261
0:9:18,7 --> 0:9:21,345
This looks like tiramisu.


262
0:9:21,345 --> 0:9:24,13
The chocolate was great the way
it was, but then when you


263
0:9:24,13 --> 0:9:27,32
put that little bit of whipped
cream on the top, and they


264
0:9:27,32 --> 0:9:31,53
happen to be using Battenkill
Farms milk


265
0:9:31,53 --> 0:9:33,4
from Salem, New York.


266
0:9:33,4 --> 0:9:34,785
JOSH OZERSKY: You're not going
to believe this shit.


267
0:9:34,785 --> 0:9:35,98
You know why it's so good?


268
0:9:35,98 --> 0:9:36,686
MICHAEL WHITE: Why?


269
0:9:36,686 --> 0:9:38,1
JOSH OZERSKY: You know what
the milk they use?


270
0:9:38,1 --> 0:9:38,94
From "Bambi".


271
0:9:38,94 --> 0:9:38,98
MICHAEL WHITE: Yes!


272
0:9:38,98 --> 0:9:39,48
I knew it!


273
0:9:39,48 --> 0:9:41,3
JOSH OZERSKY: From Battenkill,
Battenkill.


274
0:9:41,3 --> 0:9:42,45
MICHAEL WHITE: Is this
Battenkill milk?


275
0:9:42,45 --> 0:9:44,202
JOSH OZERSKY: It's
Battenkill milk!


276
0:9:44,202 --> 0:9:47,51
That's what Michael always had
his cream sauces with the


277
0:9:47,51 --> 0:9:52,49
incredible yellow cream
from Battenkill Farms.


278
0:9:52,49 --> 0:9:53,38
Sick.


279
0:9:53,38 --> 0:9:55,32
JOSH CAPON: The vanilla
is the best.


280
0:9:55,32 --> 0:9:56,16

281
0:9:56,16 --> 0:9:57,766
MICHAEL WHITE: Take care.

0:9:57,766 --> 0:9:58,224
OLIVIA YOUNG: [INAUDIBLE].


283
0:9:58,224 --> 0:10:0,4
JOSH OZERSKY: Please tell me you
can get back in the car.


284
0:10:0,4 --> 0:10:3,238



285
0:10:3,238 --> 0:10:4,488
JOSH CAPON: [SINGING].


286
0:10:4,488 --> 0:10:7,13



287
0:10:7,13 --> 0:10:9,69
JOSH OZERSKY: Why do you keep
singing these strange songs?


288
0:10:9,69 --> 0:10:11,22
He's not annoying enough.


289
0:10:11,22 --> 0:10:12,66
I need him to be
more annoying.


290
0:10:12,66 --> 0:10:14,955
JOSH CAPON: Why do you have to
be a self-loathing fat man?

[MUSIC PLAYING]


292
0:10:17,25 --> 0:10:18,2
MICHAEL WHITE: We're here.


293
0:10:18,2 --> 0:10:20,72
And then the munchies
food frenzy


294
0:10:20,72 --> 0:10:21,97
started at Osteria Morini.


295
0:10:21,97 --> 0:10:26,619



296
0:10:26,619 --> 0:10:28,85
One of the great parts about
going to your own restaurants


297
0:10:28,85 --> 0:10:31,14
is you're there with
your people.


298
0:10:31,14 --> 0:10:34,51
I text them and they were in the
area so that's really how


299
0:10:34,51 --> 0:10:35,11
it happens a lot.


300
0:10:35,11 --> 0:10:38,157
We-- it's very hard to organize
in the chef world.


301
0:10:38,157 --> 0:10:39,81
This is a pu pu platter.


302
0:10:39,81 --> 0:10:42,85
This is a Swiss chard
and pancetta cake


303
0:10:42,85 --> 0:10:46,31
with parmigiano perma.


304
0:10:46,31 --> 0:10:49,23
We hit it pretty hard in the
restaurant, so munchies


305
0:10:49,23 --> 0:10:52,12
happens like from the time we
start to the time we end.


306
0:10:52,12 --> 0:10:54,61
It was loaded, loaded.


307
0:10:54,61 --> 0:10:59,33
But I would say our go-to
food would be pizza.


308
0:10:59,33 --> 0:11:0,67
Pizza's a big deal.


309
0:11:0,67 --> 0:11:2,49
Did you guys know you were
eating Nicoletta pizza


310
0:11:2,49 --> 0:11:2,958
tonight?


311
0:11:2,958 --> 0:11:3,894
-Nicoletta pizza!

0:11:3,894 --> 0:11:7,586

313
0:11:7,586 --> 0:11:8,88

a Josh Ozersky


314
0:11:8,88 --> 0:11:9,61
special right now.


315
0:11:9,61 --> 0:11:12,26
It's going to be
a meat-lover's.


316
0:11:12,26 --> 0:11:13,53
This is all wild fennel
from Italy.


317
0:11:13,53 --> 0:11:17,98



318
0:11:17,98 --> 0:11:18,59
And then we're going
to put some of


319
0:11:18,59 --> 0:11:21,76
this thick-cut pepperoni.


320
0:11:21,76 --> 0:11:23,73
Because it has collagen
casings, natural,


321
0:11:23,73 --> 0:11:25,906
and they cup up.


322
0:11:25,906 --> 0:11:28,33
I think pizza is probably the
most satisfying thing.

0:11:28,33 --> 0:11:33,54

0:11:33,54 --> 0:11:35,52

there my friend, that's--
you're the first

0:11:38,47 --> 0:11:39,99
person having Nicoletta.


328
0:11:39,99 --> 0:11:42,65
I'm so excited about Nicoletta
Pizzeria-- that's the new


329
0:11:42,65 --> 0:11:46,6
place I'm doing, and then to eat
with those guys, because


330
0:11:46,6 --> 0:11:47,39
they're going to be
tough on me, too.


331
0:11:47,39 --> 0:11:49,468
They're not going
to hold back.

it's got a little dom, it's
got a little dom in it.

MICHAEL WHITE: Josh kind of gave
his this is good, this is


338
0:12:4,91 --> 0:12:6,45
better than I thought
it was going to be.


339
0:12:6,45 --> 0:12:9,28
Which is kind of like a
backhanded compliment, but I


340
0:12:9,28 --> 0:12:11,491
would expect nothing
less from him.

0:12:11,491 --> 0:12:12,38

0:12:32,16 --> 0:12:33,23
when he eats, though.


353
0:12:33,23 --> 0:12:35,1
He says, that's it, that's--
