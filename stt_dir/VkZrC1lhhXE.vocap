###8 TREVOR KUNK: I knew walking in here, I knew even before I got
###11 here, that I wanted to be at Blue Hill.
###12 There wasn't anywhere else that I wanted to be.
###15 If I came here to eat with my parents, just because they
###18 were visiting from Florida, they were like, well, where
###19 should we go eat?
###20 I was like there's this place called Blue Hill.
###21 And I want to try it.
###22 I want to go so bad.
###24 We came.
###25 I can remember exactly where I sat, where my mother and my
###29 father sat, at what table, and just had a mind-blowing meal.
###32 It's exciting.
###33 It's alive.
###34 So at that point is when I knew that I had to
###37 come here and work.
###38 
###50 My name's Trevor Kunk.
###51 I'm a Chef de Cuisine at Blue Hill New York
###52 in Greenwich Village.
###54 
###57 Farm to table is kind of loosely used right now.
###60 If it's a seasonal restaurant.
###61 But it's more of a micro-seasonal.
###63 When we say seasonal, it's truly seasonal with the
###66 vegetables that we're serving here, the fruit that we're
###68 serving, with the meat, with the fish.
###70 And that window of usage is anywhere from, let's say, two
###74 weeks to three months.
###77 There isn't really any dish that's on the menu year round.
###79 That somebody could come here in January and then come back
###82 in June and say, you know what, I was here in January, I
###85 really want that salt-baked rutabaga.
###87 They're not going to have it when they're coming in June.
###89 So what we have here is a gill feather rutabaga, though this
###92 is salt dough made with compost.
###95 The initial idea behind this was the way of taking a salt
###98 crust and cooking something inside.
###102 Why can't we use the compost to bake with?
###105 A little bit of hay as well.
###106 The hay does lend a little bit of flavor, a little earthiness
###109 to the rutabaga.
###111 We just played with the recipe a little bit and essentially
###113 developed a way to use the salt crust.
###116 Kind of an earthy depth that the rutabaga already has.
###119 But it just kind of helps develop it a little bit more,
###122 and it wakes it up a little bit.
###125 What we found is we work incredibly hard to source the
###128 best ingredients possible.
###129 And we look everywhere.
###131 We were looking for a great source of venison, and we
###135 found it with Halloran Farm.
###137 We actually made a road trip up there.
###139 They proposed to us that they would farm the venison for us
###142 exclusively.
###143 We hopped on it right away.
###145 And it is truly the best venison that
###147 you will ever taste.
###148 -Oh my God.
###150 -It's so good.
###151 TREVOR KUNK: I think what initially drew me to Blue Hill
###153 was at that point the local seasonal idea was just
###157 starting to take off.
###158 And there wasn't anybody that was doing it like Blue Hill
###161 was doing, and what Dan was doing.
###163 Blue Hill New York was started by Dan and David Barber.
###166 I don't know if Dan ever knew that it was going to
###169 take off like this.
###169 I don't know if he knew it was going to
###171 grow in this direction.
###172 RUBY DUKE: Almost two years ago, Trevor got
###177 in touch with us.
###178 And he had heard that we were raising whey-fed pigs.
###181 Basically, we work with only three chefs.
###184 Trevor is one of them and really, he supports our farm.
###188 Really makes it possible for our farm to exist.
###190 -Very, very fatty, but well-marbled kobe as well.
###194 TREVOR KUNK: We're cooking for the ingredient.
###197 We prepare it simply in the way that their ingredient is
###199 going to be showcased, and elevate that flavor.
###204 It's truly a passion.
###205 It's truly a family.
###206 Torch it here.
###207 And then when we pour it, we'll pour it
###209 over here on the table.
###211 So Katie Bell was a service director here.
###214 She's also, I guess, a cocktail
###215 maker, or cocktail creator.
###219 Kenny Hogue is sous chef here.
###220 He's been here for about a year and a half or so.
###223 So we left Blue Hill about 9 o'clock.
###226 First of all, it's going to be actually our
###228 first time out together--
###229 KATIE BELL: Yeah.
###229 TREVOR KUNK: --for a meal, ever.
###231 So that's very, very exciting.
###233 We're going to Gwynnett Street in Williamsburg, because
###236 there's Owen and Justin.
###238 KATIE BELL: Living in Brooklyn, I obviously have a
###239 little bit of a different perspective.
###241 But I think Brooklyn gets such a rap for good food, but
###246 absolutely lack of service, and just snooty attitudes, and
###250 all this sort of stuff.
###251 I think there's incredible food being made in Brooklyn--
###255 absolutely gorgeous food.
###256 And then also the knowledge to back it up and really
###258 beautiful service.
###259 
###263 TREVOR KUNK: What happens here in Blue Hill is the people
###265 that we bring on end up becoming friends.
###268 They end up being family.
###269 So once they do move on from Blue Hill, they'll go to
###272 another restaurant.
###273 OWEN CLARK: Hey, what's up?
###274 TREVOR KUNK: Went to go visit Owen, as well as Justin who's
###278 the chef at Gwynnett.
###279 JUSTIN HILBERT: You don't want to be on TV?
###281 You get ladies when you're on TV, bro.
###285 TREVOR KUNK: It's amazing for us to be able to go visit
###288 them, the new location, see how they're doing, taste the
###291 food that they're cooking.
###292 All right, cheers.
###292 KATIE BELL: Cheers!
###293 First night out.
###294 TREVOR KUNK: First night out ever.
###295 KATIE BELL: Took a year.
###297 TREVOR KUNK: One of the staples, whisky bread.
###300 So I think they bake it to order, right?
###301 KATIE BELL: Yeah.
###302 TREVOR KUNK: It takes like 10-12 minutes to come out.
###305 It's really delicious.
###306 
###311 TREVOR KUNK: Beautiful.
###312 KENNY HOGUE: Nice.
###313 TREVOR KUNK: All looks incredible.
###314 KENNY HOGUE: Yeah, it does.
###315 JUSTIN HILBERT: I guess it's modern American cuisine.
###318 It's in par with fine-dining food, but it's much more
###321 relaxed so there's no pretension involved or
###324 anything like that.
###324 You can wear whatever you want.
###325 You just go in and have a good time and enjoy your meal.
###328 We're just trying to do our own thing for the most part.
###331 TREVOR KUNK: Food-wise, I would say the highlights for
###334 me were the egg dish with the squid, which was mind-blowing.
###337 JUSTIN HILBERT: Take squid, you char it on the flat top.
###340 Slice it really thin and that gets sauteed with celery root
###343 that we make noodles out of.
###344 So the eggs have been poached slowly for about an hour.
###347 And then this is sea salt that's
###350 mixed with smoked paprika.
###352 Just gives it a little spice.
###353 That's it, man.
###354 TREVOR KUNK: There was a little bit of heat, there was
###356 definitely the salt, there was the acid.
###357 It was like it was warm, it was welcoming, it was what I
###360 think we needed.
###361 We had a pretty hectic day yesterday, so Katie, Kenny and
###364 I didn't really have a chance to eat that much, which was I
###366 think in the end a very good thing.
###368 What's the--
###369 dried lime?
###370 KENNY HOGUE: Yeah, it's like a hint of lime in there.
###371 It just looks like shaved lime zest.
###374 TREVOR KUNK: I will taste things and
###375 we'll learn from it.
###377 With the egg that we had tonight, there's definitely
###380 some kind of preserved lime--
###383 something to that.
###383 Weather it's dried lemon grass or dried lime leaves, that's
###386 something that we'll probably try to figure out
###387 how they did it.
###388 It's amazing.
###389 It wakes your pallet up.
###390 And it's a wakening.
###392 KENNY HOGUE: Since we are open seven days a week, whatever
###393 one of the cooks gets a day off to go eat, everyone's like
###396 where'd you go eat?
###397 Where'd you go?
###398 Tell us about it.
###399 TREVOR KUNK: Right.
###399 JUSTIN HILBERT: Thought you might like some dessert.
###403 TREVOR KUNK: All right.
###404 KENNY HOGUE: Thank you.
###405 TREVOR KUNK: Thank you for everything.
###406 Well I think with Justin, having the experience of
###410 working in a pastry department, whether inside a
###413 wd-50 or any restaurant, working in the pasty
###415 department is incredibly important.
###417 You're not only learning technique, we you're also
###421 learning how to think outside the box a little bit.
###424 KATIE BELL: They're really into the savory and sweet.
###427 TREVOR KUNK: And I think with Justin, he's taken that
###430 experience and not only developed that technique of
###434 the sweet side, but it also lends to the savory side.
###437 Comes with the ability to be able to have some sweetness in
###442 a savory dish, but not have it be overpowering, but lend
###445 itself to a duck that we ate last night with the
###448 lingonberry jam.
###450 Yes, it was sweet, but it went very well with that succulent,
###454 savory duck breast.
###456 And it comes to the plating, it comes with the flavors.
###458 We thought it was to mind-blowing as well, egg yolk
###461 encasing the cod.
###463 We had a pretty phenomenal meal.
###468 OWEN CLARK: Where are we off to, Eunice?
###469 KENNY HOGUE: I think next is Mother's Ruin.
###473 OWEN CLARK: Where is this place?
###475 TREVOR KUNK: I guess like NoLIta area.
###477 OWEN CLARK: It's weird.
###478 Living in this neighborhood and working over here all the
###480 time, it is so nice to not be in Williamsburg
###483 for a little while.
###484 That's the same skinny jeans dufus.
###487 It's like hey, what's up?
###489 TREVOR KUNK: Dude, I'm wearing skinny jeans.
###490 
###493 So after we left Gwynnett Street we
###495 went to Mother's Ruin.
###499 And walking in, I don't want to call it a neighborhood bar,
###502 because I don't think it really is, ultimately.
###504 But it was kind of like walking into home.
###506 Everybody was very friendly.
###507 And everybody that was there was excited to be there.
###510 And you could tell that they had been there before and they
###511 want you to come back again.
###513 It was like an instant party.
###516 TJ came over with the Amaro.
###517 A couple of Amaro shots.
###519 Cheers, everyone.
###520 TJ LYNCH: All right, happy Tuesday.
###523 Salute.
###524 
###526 TREVOR KUNK: The cocktails were great.
###528 TJ told us the little story having to do
###530 with the slushie machine.
###533 It began as a gift. and now they're selling it.
###535 They're like OK, we'll take your slushy machine.
###538 We'll see what we can do with it.
###539 Left it on the bar.
###540 Started playing with different ideas.
###541 And slowly developed into the whiskey slushie that we had
###545 last night, which was delicious.
###547 Whiskey, they had like some fall, aromatic spices as well.
###551 We're going back to Blue Hill for family meal.
###554 OWEN CLARK: Nice.
###555 TREVOR KUNK: And we want you to come if you can swing it.
###557 TJ LYNCH: Yeah, cheers, guys.
###558 TREVOR KUNK: All right, cheers.
###559 
###568 TJ LYNCH: It's nice when I get out of there.
###570 TREVOR KUNK: Yeah?
###571 [INAUDIBLE].
###574 TREVOR KUNK: The new addition is TJ.
###577 The other TJ, yes.
###578 And actually, I'm a TJ as well, born and raised.
###582 But when I came to New York, I became Trevor.
###584 TJ LYNCH: We're going to go for family meal, huh?
###585 TREVOR KUNK: We are.
###586 TJ LYNCH: Very exciting.
###587 TREVOR KUNK: Special.
###587 TJ LYNCH: Tacos.
###588 TREVOR KUNK: Yeah, like Penny said, taco Sunday on Tuesday.
###591 
###594 Hello!
###597 So we came back to Blue Hill and cooked what we like to
###602 call a family meal.
###603 So it was kind of our taco Sunday that we do every Sunday
###606 for our staff, but elevated to times 20.
###610 Michelle, our wine director, opened up a double magnum of
###613 champagne, so we were able to share that as we got back.
###615 In the kitchen I cooked what was essentially like a braised
###619 pig head that we had diced and pressed, and then just fried
###622 off in the black pans.
###624 So it's a pig head.
###626 We cooked it in a [INAUDIBLE], then finished with raw
###631 shallots, pickled shallots, lots of chopped herbs.
###635 Now the idea is that it's going to start popping, it's
###637 going to start rendering.
###638 All the fat's going to come out.
###640 All the protein's going to get crispy.
###641 Kind of like a sisig, the Filipino traditional dish.
###646 There's something in that realm of the world that I
###649 guess I really like when I'm not working.
###651 
###654 KENNY HOGUE: Everybody contributed.
###656 TREVOR KUNK: Francine Lee who works in our pastry department
###660 here was born and raised in Korea.
###661 So she'll make a kimchi and bring it in for us to share
###665 with the family.
###666 Alfredo who's was one of our prep cooks here, is from
###670 Mexico originally.
###671 And his mother is a very, very good cook, especially when it
###673 comes to her mole.
###675 So I think the rotation's like once a month or
###678 so she'll make mole.
###679 She'll freeze it and then she'll ship it to Alfredo.
###681 So Alfredo actually came in on his day off yesterday to cook
###684 that for us and to share it with us.
###686 
###689 Here we go.
###691 Haskell, you're next buddy, let's go.
###694 Come on.
###696 The kind of amazing thing with Haskell is, is he's been
###698 eating here since he was a small child.
###700 But he used to come in like once or twice a year.
###702 He would come in with his mom.
###703 He was just very passionate about food
###704 and loved Blue Hill.
###706 So over the years, after all those meals, he decided to go
###709 to a special school here in New York, kind of like a
###711 technical school slash culinary school.
###714 After finishing that, he's like I want to
###716 intern at Blue Hill.
###716 That's where I want to be.
###718 It reflects on what we do for our guests.
###721 We cook our hearts out for them, and we want to serve
###723 them the best food possible.
###725 But we also have found that the staff that's serving them,
###729 our family, is incredibly important as well.
###731 And to keep them the happiest is to feed them well.
###736 It just makes people happy and it makes people excited.
###738
