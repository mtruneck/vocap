0:0:19,43 --> 0:0:20,0
DAVID: I'm David Chang.


3
0:0:20,0 --> 0:0:22,906
We're going to the mean
streets of K-Town.


4
0:0:22,906 --> 0:0:24,328
[LAUGHTER]


5
0:0:24,328 --> 0:0:28,6



6
0:0:28,6 --> 0:0:30,56
DAVID: I got into this
profession because there's


7
0:0:30,56 --> 0:0:32,78
something honest about getting
better every day.


8
0:0:32,78 --> 0:0:36,33
Like, OK, my knife skills aren't
very good here but, use


9
0:0:36,33 --> 0:0:36,85
it every day.


10
0:0:36,85 --> 0:0:39,81
And after a year or two you can
start to see progression.


11
0:0:39,81 --> 0:0:46,818



12
0:0:46,818 --> 0:0:49,98
I spent time at the Mercer
kitchen, worked at a variety


13
0:0:49,98 --> 0:0:52,59
of little establishment
in Tokyo.


14
0:0:52,59 --> 0:0:55,6
Spent some time at Cafe Boulud
under Andrew Carmellini.


15
0:0:55,6 --> 0:0:59,8
There was a variety of things
that led to me leaving.


16
0:0:59,8 --> 0:1:1,16
I was having a hard time keeping
up with the rest of


17
0:1:1,16 --> 0:1:2,99
the crew at Cafe Boulud.


18
0:1:2,99 --> 0:1:6,49
It sort of reminded me that
I wasn't that great.


19
0:1:6,49 --> 0:1:10,28
The cooks around me were
all more talented.


20
0:1:10,28 --> 0:1:13,8
And ultimately I would always
look at Andrew Carmellini and


21
0:1:13,8 --> 0:1:16,122
be like, I'm never going
to be as good as him.


22
0:1:16,122 --> 0:1:19,74



23
0:1:19,74 --> 0:1:21,652
PETER: What's the awareness
of Momofuku among the


24
0:1:21,652 --> 0:1:23,52
Korean-American population
here?


25
0:1:23,52 --> 0:1:24,72
DAVID: Do you see me
hanging out with


26
0:1:24,72 --> 0:1:26,332
Korean Americans much?


27
0:1:26,332 --> 0:1:28,8
SUE: They love you.


28
0:1:28,8 --> 0:1:31,3
Every single day I have like
10 requests from a fucking


29
0:1:31,3 --> 0:1:32,18
Korean newspaper--


30
0:1:32,18 --> 0:1:34,68
the third largest Korean
newspaper.


31
0:1:34,68 --> 0:1:36,38
DAVID: I needed to
challenge myself.


32
0:1:36,38 --> 0:1:42,17
I thought opening a restaurant
would be the ultimate test to


33
0:1:42,17 --> 0:1:43,87
see if I could just do it.


34
0:1:43,87 --> 0:1:45,59
And that was really
the first goal.


35
0:1:45,59 --> 0:1:46,83
Can I open it up?


36
0:1:46,83 --> 0:1:49,5
Didn't really think about the
food I was going to serve.


37
0:1:49,5 --> 0:1:52,39
I knew I wanted to do a noodle
bar, and that was


38
0:1:52,39 --> 0:1:54,53
the extent of it.


39
0:1:54,53 --> 0:1:56,74
This spot was the first
restaurant.


40
0:1:56,74 --> 0:1:58,8
This was the original
noodle bar.


41
0:1:58,8 --> 0:2:1,34
And now this is transformed
to Momofuku Ko.


42
0:2:1,34 --> 0:2:5,8
And we have Ssam Bar on 13th
and Second, and Milk Bar.


43
0:2:5,8 --> 0:2:9,46
And yeah, shit, just a lot.


44
0:2:9,46 --> 0:2:12,74
We are on the corner
of 32nd and 5th.


45
0:2:12,74 --> 0:2:15,46
We're going to Mad
for Chicken.


46
0:2:15,46 --> 0:2:18,13
We're here with our good
friend, Peter Meehan,


47
0:2:18,13 --> 0:2:20,94
co-author of our cookbook.


48
0:2:20,94 --> 0:2:25,68
And Sue Chan works at our
office at Momofuku.


49
0:2:25,68 --> 0:2:28,935
So that's it.


50
0:2:28,935 --> 0:2:49,572
[MUSIC-- THE DIRTY FENCES]


51
0:2:49,572 --> 0:2:52,32
SUE CHAN: Oh my god,
what's this?


52
0:2:52,32 --> 0:2:53,16
What the hell is that?


53
0:2:53,16 --> 0:2:56,39
DAVID: Beer.


54
0:2:56,39 --> 0:2:59,45
SUE: Oh my god.


55
0:2:59,45 --> 0:3:2,26
DAVID: When I lived in Korea,
you could get the mini liter,


56
0:3:2,26 --> 0:3:3,78
or like the huge liter.


57
0:3:3,78 --> 0:3:7,18
You just try to drink it
as fast as possible.


58
0:3:7,18 --> 0:3:8,41
PETER: Wow.


59
0:3:8,41 --> 0:3:10,4
DAVID: That's just
fucking great.


60
0:3:10,4 --> 0:3:12,33
I feel like I'm in Korea.


61
0:3:12,33 --> 0:3:14,87
This is so Korean it's insane.


62
0:3:14,87 --> 0:3:18,36
I am the worst type
of chef, I guess.


63
0:3:18,36 --> 0:3:20,89
I don't like to go out to eat
to fancy restaurant, or


64
0:3:20,89 --> 0:3:22,3
restaurants in general.


65
0:3:22,3 --> 0:3:24,37
Why did they give us the
non-chicken menu?


66
0:3:24,37 --> 0:3:26,494
I can't find any chicken.


67
0:3:26,494 --> 0:3:29,2
Oh, there, on the front page.


68
0:3:29,2 --> 0:3:30,5
I'm dumb.


69
0:3:30,5 --> 0:3:31,93
PETER: Mad for wings, mad for
drums, mad for combo.


70
0:3:31,93 --> 0:3:33,43
DAVID: I think we go combo.


71
0:3:33,43 --> 0:3:36,86
What I want to eat, personally,
is straightforward


72
0:3:36,86 --> 0:3:39,28
stuff, something that's
assuming, and you can go to,


73
0:3:39,28 --> 0:3:40,41
and there's no bullshit.


74
0:3:40,41 --> 0:3:41,29
There's no pretense.


75
0:3:41,29 --> 0:3:42,72
You're just going to eat.


76
0:3:42,72 --> 0:3:44,77
Can we get a mad for combo?


77
0:3:44,77 --> 0:3:46,52
Hot and spicy.


78
0:3:46,52 --> 0:3:48,75
SUE: Notice his nice voice?


79
0:3:48,75 --> 0:3:50,77
DAVID: Sue's leaving soon.


80
0:3:50,77 --> 0:3:53,94
I don't know, Chinese food
sort of hits the spot.


81
0:3:53,94 --> 0:3:56,1
Or Asian food, or Korean Town.


82
0:3:56,1 --> 0:3:59,55



83
0:3:59,55 --> 0:4:2,25
I want to have a successful
restaurant group.


84
0:4:2,25 --> 0:4:4,16
I want our employees
to do well.


85
0:4:4,16 --> 0:4:6,18
I want them to have the creative
freedom to express


86
0:4:6,18 --> 0:4:7,41
themselves.


87
0:4:7,41 --> 0:4:10,73
I want a lot of different
things.


88
0:4:10,73 --> 0:4:13,7
But I'm not necessarily too
thrilled with the baggage that


89
0:4:13,7 --> 0:4:13,93
comes with it.


90
0:4:13,93 --> 0:4:14,77
We were open.


91
0:4:14,77 --> 0:4:18,525
And we didn't get reviewed
for eight months.


92
0:4:18,525 --> 0:4:20,7
I was like, man, we must really


93
0:4:20,7 --> 0:4:22,45
fucking suck, or something.


94
0:4:22,45 --> 0:4:23,93
We did suck.


95
0:4:23,93 --> 0:4:26,62
So it was terrible.


96
0:4:26,62 --> 0:4:28,65
The food was fucking bad.


97
0:4:28,65 --> 0:4:31,67
Because we were just learning
how to run a restaurant.


98
0:4:31,67 --> 0:4:35,36
I was trying to figure how
to run a cash register.


99
0:4:35,36 --> 0:4:36,755
PETER: The first time
I went to Momofuku I


100
0:4:36,755 --> 0:4:37,63
fucking hated it.


101
0:4:37,63 --> 0:4:40,32
I went back later on when
they got better.


102
0:4:40,32 --> 0:4:41,64
I had heard they were
getting better.


103
0:4:41,64 --> 0:4:44,656
And I had a great meal,
and then had three


104
0:4:44,656 --> 0:4:45,8
or four great meals.


105
0:4:45,8 --> 0:4:47,33
And then I wrote the review.


106
0:4:47,33 --> 0:4:50,36
DAVID: And I was trying to
figure out who this fucking


107
0:4:50,36 --> 0:4:52,2
Peter Meehan dude was.


108
0:4:52,2 --> 0:4:53,79
Because you always want
to spot the critics.


109
0:4:53,79 --> 0:4:57,44
PETER: I was eating at Momofuku
every Saturday with


110
0:4:57,44 --> 0:4:59,9
Mark Bittman, who was the
guy I used to work for.


111
0:4:59,9 --> 0:5:1,8
He had written about Dave.


112
0:5:1,8 --> 0:5:4,42
And at some point he was like,
I'm telling Dave who you are.


113
0:5:4,42 --> 0:5:5,81
And I was like, OK, whatever.


114
0:5:5,81 --> 0:5:8,22
You already gone on to such
great heights of fame that I


115
0:5:8,22 --> 0:5:11,67
know I could never sully
your reputation


116
0:5:11,67 --> 0:5:12,6
with my byline again.


117
0:5:12,6 --> 0:5:16,3
And it was very awkward and
fast, how you want if if


118
0:5:16,3 --> 0:5:17,8
you're a restaurant reviewer.


119
0:5:17,8 --> 0:5:19,71
DAVID: You guys ordered
grits and pig tails.


120
0:5:19,71 --> 0:5:21,54
And I think I might have
been hungover.


121
0:5:21,54 --> 0:5:23,92
PETER: Quite possibly.


122
0:5:23,92 --> 0:5:24,58
DAVID: And that was it.


123
0:5:24,58 --> 0:5:26,316
I was like, you're
fucking Meehan?


124
0:5:26,316 --> 0:5:28,1
I was like, you're the guy.


125
0:5:28,1 --> 0:5:30,23
PETER: Then there was a point
at which Dave was getting


126
0:5:30,23 --> 0:5:32,36
bombarded with offers
to do a cookbook


127
0:5:32,36 --> 0:5:34,55
from agents and authors.


128
0:5:34,55 --> 0:5:37,16
We were having dinner at Ssam
Bar, actually with Mark


129
0:5:37,16 --> 0:5:38,3
Bittman again.


130
0:5:38,3 --> 0:5:39,9
And he was like, well you're
not going to be


131
0:5:39,9 --> 0:5:40,87
this popular forever.


132
0:5:40,87 --> 0:5:42,53
So you better cash
in quick, and do


133
0:5:42,53 --> 0:5:44,5
this as soon as possible.


134
0:5:44,5 --> 0:5:48,22
And Chang was like, well if
people do it with me.


135
0:5:48,22 --> 0:5:49,17
DAVID: I had no idea.


136
0:5:49,17 --> 0:5:50,5
Everyone wanted to write
a fucking book.


137
0:5:50,5 --> 0:5:53,6
And I was just like,
that's news to me.


138
0:5:53,6 --> 0:5:55,67
PETER: You were less interested
in doing a book of


139
0:5:55,67 --> 0:6:2,28
recipes than in kind of getting
the story down of the


140
0:6:2,28 --> 0:6:7,2
wild and early years
of Momofuku.


141
0:6:7,2 --> 0:6:9,892
And I was more interested in the
recipes, because I have to


142
0:6:9,892 --> 0:6:11,7
pay for food at Momofuku.


143
0:6:11,7 --> 0:6:12,66
So being able to make
it home seemed


144
0:6:12,66 --> 0:6:13,84
like it might be cheaper.


145
0:6:13,84 --> 0:6:14,89
So I get a little bit.


146
0:6:14,89 --> 0:6:15,75
You get a little bit.


147
0:6:15,75 --> 0:6:17,343
In the end, no one's happy?


148
0:6:17,343 --> 0:6:21,5

JOSE: I couldn't believe you
came up with this thing.


211
0:9:6,67 --> 0:9:13,167



212
0:9:13,167 --> 0:9:14,82
DAVID: I was reading the
Jose Andres cookbook.


213
0:9:14,82 --> 0:9:16,9
JOSE: And it's amazing.


214
0:9:16,9 --> 0:9:18,668
DAVID: It inspired me.


215
0:9:18,668 --> 0:9:21,74
JOSE: Before I taste it I was
like, this guy is insane.


216
0:9:21,74 --> 0:9:22,99
He's a nice kid, but--


217
0:9:22,99 --> 0:9:26,211



218
0:9:26,211 --> 0:9:28,15
and then it's good.


219
0:9:28,15 --> 0:9:29,32
DAVID: It works, right?


220
0:9:29,32 --> 0:9:30,166
It works.


221
0:9:30,166 --> 0:9:31,984
Weirdly enough it works.


222
0:9:31,984 --> 0:9:32,85
Looting.


223
0:9:32,85 --> 0:9:36,32
Here's to fucking burning
and looting.


224
0:9:36,32 --> 0:9:37,76
That's a Bob Marley song.


225
0:9:37,76 --> 0:9:39,695
I have no idea.


226
0:9:39,695 --> 0:9:42,9
I'm drunk.


227
0:9:42,9 --> 0:9:44,96
We're at Momofuku Ssam Bar.


228
0:9:44,96 --> 0:9:47,42
And I'm making pork buns.


229
0:9:47,42 --> 0:9:49,55
And this has become a signature
dish at this


230
0:9:49,55 --> 0:9:50,46
restaurant.


231
0:9:50,46 --> 0:9:52,5
I think we probably sell between
all the restaurants


232
0:9:52,5 --> 0:9:55,16
maybe 300, 400 a day.


233
0:9:55,16 --> 0:9:59,17
Even though I haven't made a
pork bun in quite a while, I


234
0:9:59,17 --> 0:10:2,61
will still say I think I make
more pork buns than most


235
0:10:2,61 --> 0:10:4,483
people will on this planet.


236
0:10:4,483 --> 0:10:6,95
You've had Wonder
Bread before.


237
0:10:6,95 --> 0:10:10,44
So imagine Wonder Bread without
it being cooked in an


238
0:10:10,44 --> 0:10:14,17
oven, and it being
steamed instead.


239
0:10:14,17 --> 0:10:19,67
Sauce is Hoisin, which
translates to--


240
0:10:19,67 --> 0:10:22,45
I have no fucking
idea anymore.


241
0:10:22,45 --> 0:10:24,25
SUE: It's got sesame, salt.


242
0:10:24,25 --> 0:10:29,1



243
0:10:29,1 --> 0:10:35,67
DAVID: It's a couple teaspoons
of salt, and some black


244
0:10:35,67 --> 0:10:39,475
pepper, and a couple hours of
don't fucking worry about it.


245
0:10:39,475 --> 0:10:49,68



246
0:10:49,68 --> 0:10:52,93
DAVID: Chef Jose Andres, one
of the greatest chefs in


247
0:10:52,93 --> 0:10:54,76
America is giving me shit.


248
0:10:54,76 --> 0:10:56,83
And I'm cool with that.


249
0:10:56,83 --> 0:10:59,6
Put the belly on
some sea folds.


250
0:10:59,6 --> 0:11:1,4
And that's what you'd have.


251
0:11:1,4 --> 0:11:2,35
Pork buns.


252
0:11:2,35 --> 0:11:4,1
This is not how we
really serve it.


253
0:11:4,1 --> 0:11:7,31
SUE: This is just when Dave is
alone here at Ssam Bar in the


254
0:11:7,31 --> 0:11:9,11
middle of the night at
2:00 in the morning.


255
0:11:9,11 --> 0:11:11,4
This is how he treats
himself right.


256
0:11:11,4 --> 0:11:14,5



257
0:11:14,5 --> 0:11:16,65
DAVID: What's your favorite
thing you eat before you go to


258
0:11:16,65 --> 0:11:19,47
bed while you're fucking
drunk as shit?


259
0:11:19,47 --> 0:11:20,982
What are you going to say?


260
0:11:20,982 --> 0:11:24,26
Ox tail, fucking bone marrow?


261
0:11:24,26 --> 0:11:25,6
Bullshit.


262
0:11:25,6 --> 0:11:28,27
It's that fucking crappy ass
piece of pizza that you ate.


263
0:11:28,27 --> 0:11:30,984
And you don't even fucking
remember that you ate.


264
0:11:30,984 --> 0:11:39,44



265
0:11:39,44 --> 0:11:42,33
Usually it's like,
that's weird.


266
0:11:42,33 --> 0:11:43,84
I just vomited something
this morning that I


267
0:11:43,84 --> 0:11:46,57
don't remember I ate.


268
0:11:46,57 --> 0:13:46,57
