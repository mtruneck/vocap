###0 -Where's his skateboard at?
###1 -I don't know.
###1 You mean Shawn?
###3 -Yeah, the friend you came with.
###5 He's a fucking bitch.
###5 -You are, your boy's going to get fucked up.
###7 -He's going to get his ass kicked if I fucking see him
###9 again.
###10 -Yeah.
###10 Did he jet?
###11 -I guess, dude.
###11 But you tell me he shouldn't never talk shit because we
###14 don't be talking shit about nobody.
###15 -That's cool.
###16 -You respect us, we respect you, you know what I'm saying?
###18 -That's cool.
###18 -Tell your boy,
###21 -Where's his board at?
###22 -I'll keep the [INAUDIBLE] focused in on him.

###41 PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, welcome back to "Epicly Later'd." This
###45 week's episode is about the Menace team.
###48 And it's not about any specific person, it's just
###51 sort of about a cultural shift in skateboarding.
###53 -Fuck you got to say, niggah?
###55 PATRICK O'DELL: You know, LA, New York, all these city kid
###57 skaters that kind of came together as the team Menace.
###61 It's kinda thuggy, it's kind of dangerous.
###63 When I was a kid and somebody had like the NWA tape and it
###66 was really bad to have.
###69 Menace was like skating's version of that--
###72 like skating's NWA.
###74 Some of these skaters, like Fabian and Steven Cales, they
###77 ended up doing a lot of time in jail.
###80 Joey's found religion, he has a family, he's
###82 doing really well.
###83 We caught up with Eric Pupecki in Rhode Island.
###86 Javier Nunez is doing great, he's an actor.
###89 So these shows aren't perfect.
###92 Maybe four or five times I made a plan with Green and
###94 then it fell through.
###95 I'm not talking shit on the guy, I'm just saying he's hard
###99 to a hold of.
###99 Basically I'm saying we don't have the
###101 Kareem Campbell interview.
###102 That's how it is.
###103 For a long time I've kind of had this on the back burner as
###106 an episode I wanted to do.
###107 Like, I should do a Menace episode.
###109 So I'm glad this is finally coming out.
###112 I hope you enjoy it.
###114 
###118 BILLY VALDES: We had no Kareem for, I don't know, forever.
###122 He'll probably deny this, but I claim I
###125 taught him 360 flips.
###127 This is when he was on World SMA.
###130 And I was trying to get on Grind King.
###132 That's like '89 or something.
###135 PATRICK O'DELL: Tell me about exactly how you got on Menace?
###139 BILLY VALDES: Kareem was a hot boy at the time, winning all
###143 these contests.
###144 Skating for world after the whole, basically,
###147 Girl/Chocolate team now, or then--
###150 I guess now it's different, too.
###153 Al Quinn started Girl Skateboards, and Kareem had an
###157 opportunity to start his own company.
###159 And since we had all been friends for a while, I guess
###164 he saw something in this.
###165 No, that's boring.
###167 
###171 SOCRATES LEAL: Kareem came back, got on World.
###174 We were all psyched.
###176 And he was on World for a couple years before he came up
###180 with the idea for Menace and just put together a team of
###183 dudes that hung out in LA.
###185 They always hung out at that extra large shop.
###188 So he put together that team and said hey, wouldn't you
###190 mind filming these guys?
###191 I was like, oh yeah, I'm down to film these dudes.
###193 
###201 This is the first transfer tip for Menace because that was
###205 their first logo right there.
###206 PATRICK O'DELL: What were the plans with all the footage?
###208 SOCRATES LEAL: Well, of course we were going to try to make
###209 them a video.
###210 PATRICK O'DELL: What were the challenges of that?
###211 SOCRATES LEAL: That Kareem needed to approve it.
###214 It's his company and his first video, and I feel him on that.
###218 He wanted to make sure it was top notch.
###220 PATRICK O'DELL: He didn't think it was good enough?
###222 SOCRATES LEAL: I can't put words in his mouth, you know?
###225 All I know is that he just kind of put a stop on it.
###228 
###233 Filming for Menace was one of those deals where it was at
###236 the moment.
###237 If you were there at a spot, and I had the camera and
###240 everyone else was kind of along with
###241 it, it would happen.
###243 And if it didn't for whatever reason, like we'd get kicked
###245 out of a spot or he'd break his board, then that day was
###248 over and that would never happen again.
###250 PATRICK O'DELL: Were you ever worried about going to some of
###252 the sketchy neighborhoods and stuff like that?
###253 Because I always heard of like Lockwood, people get their
###255 cameras stolen.
###256 SOCRATES LEAL: Yeah.
###256 I mean, I found out about all that after I had been filming
###259 it for like a year or two.
###260 One day we were there filming, it was like a 4th of July, and
###264 I remember hearing the shots.
###265 But I was filming lines running around the schoolyard.
###271 PATRICK O'DELL: Originally, not that many
###273 people skated here?
###274 FABIAN ALOMAR: No.
###275 It was only a few gang members right here from La Medalla
###278 neighborhood.
###279 And then when we started skating here, they would kind
###281 of give us a little bit of static.
###284 I've got uncles from that same neighborhood.
###286 And it turns out that my uncle snatched them up and told them
###290 that's my nephew and his friends.
###292 Those dudes are cool to skate here whenever they want.
###294 And you know, back then I wasn't even trying
###296 to look for no beef.
###297 We were just trying to skate.
###298 Trying to get away from the beef.
###299 GUY MARIANO: These kids were like the outcasts of
###301 skateboarding.
###303 They didn't have the skateboard
###304 image that people wanted.
###307 I really like the fact that when Menace was started,
###310 Kareem was really good friends with everybody in
###313 skateboarding.
###313 He could have handpicked just top skaters, but he came for
###318 Billy, Joey, Eric Pupecki and Fabian.
###321 It was the real thing.
###322 It was just like you guys are a little crew, and I want it.
###328 ERIC PUPECKI: It was like kind of the same thing as the
###332 deluxe deal.
###332 They don't know what to do with me.
###334 That's what Menace is all about.
###335 The team of guys that no one knows what
###337 the fuck to do with.
###338 All right, I'll take you, you and you.
###341 Boom, now we got a team or misfits or whatever.
###345 -All you motherfucking corns, eat.
###347 ERIC PUPECKI: Like I said, no contracts.
###348 Not even like, hey Eric, would you like to be on Menace
###352 skateboards?
###353 One day I'm on Menace now, I'm hanging out with all of them,
###355 I'm on the team.
###358 So it was just kind of nonchalant.
###360 So that's why there was no real money either.
###362 It was just different times.
###364 
###366 LEE SMITH: I skated for ATM for about, I guess
###369 it was like a year.
###370 And that turned to 60/40 and kind of dissolved.
###374 And then when Joey and those guys got with Kareem, I guess
###378 Kareem was looking for an am.
###380 And they were like well, we were already skating with Lee
###382 on 60/40 at ATM, so let's bring him over.
###384 
###387 STEVEN CALES: I got out of prison, right, and I'm hanging
###391 out with Maurice Key.
###393 He was going on a World Menace tour.
###395 So I said, man, I'm just going to go see my boys.
###399 So I'm on parole and I'm not supposed to leave, but I know
###403 I could sneak away for a weekend.
###405 I met up with Kareem and all these guys.
###407 And so we went skating, and we did those demos.
###409 I skated in the demos and whatever, and I guess I skated
###412 good enough and maybe the World went back to wherever it
###415 went to and I was on.
###417 I was on Menace and somebody was like hey, this little
###420 kid's on Menace, too, from out here.
###421 And I was like oh yeah, who?
###422 PATRICK O'DELL: What did he look like?
###424 STEVEN CALES: He's just little with big hands and big arms.
###428 He was a little pothead.
###428 I was like dang, this is a bad ass kid.
###431 But it reminded me of me because I was doing
###433 that at that age.
###435 JAVIER NUNEZ: Yeah, well I'm not "Little Hob" no more.
###437 Everyone knows me for Little Hob.
###439 It's been documented.
###441 So like I said, from 11 to 13 being in New York a lot of
###445 things were rolling for me.
###447 Me and Maurice were skating that night and Kareem happened
###450 to see us do our thing.
###452 Got Maurice Key on World Industries.
###454 And he put me on Menace before it actually started, but it
###460 was in the process of becoming the real thing.
###463 BILLY VALDES: We had plans for Ivan Perez in Brooklyn.
###467 I wanted to get Rick Ibaseta on the team.
###469 PATRICK O'DELL: Socrates was saying that Shiloh was going
###471 to get on, too.
###473 Or, these was talk of that or something.
###474 BILLY VALDES: That's between Shiloh and Kareem.
###478 I don't know, I thought at first it was, too.
###481 I think that was the original plan.
###483 I don't know who changed it.
###485 Kareem's the mastermind.
###487 Like it said, if you look at the bottom, [INAUDIBLE]
###489 Mastermind distribution and he's lurking in the
###492 background.
###493 PATRICK O'DELL: Are they much different from 101, Blind,
###497 Plan B, World?
###497 SOCRATES LEAL: Well, yeah, image-wise definitely.
###499 Because right off the bat, it seemed like their whole thing
###502 was a thugged out image, the whole Menace.
###505 In the first one, I was like beating up that kid.
###508 SOCRATES LEAL: Yeah, that wasn't a skit.
###509 We were at Lockwood and that was a friend of theirs.
###511 And for some reason they always use to get off on
###513 hitting him really hard.
###515 So yeah, that day it started off as something simple.
###518 And one of the dudes might let a couple of those kicks or
###522 punches go a little too far.
###523 He got a little hurt on that deal.
###525 I think maybe they thought they had to put a little more
###528 effort into it because the cameras were rolling.
###529 
###534 JOEY SURIEL: Nothing was scripted, everything was
###537 spontaneous.
###538 Before I can only probably count two or three people that
###541 ever used hip-hop in a skate video.
###544 Now looking back at those specific times, it was just us
###548 really showing the skateboard world skateboarding through
###553 our perspective.
###556 -Like this, like this, yeah.
###558 -Make it look like that, bitch ass niggas.
###561 -And I'll be honest with you, I never thought that we made
###564 the impact that obviously I've come to know that we made.
###568 Just from the response that we've been getting from all
###571 these people that we deal with now on a different level.
###574 And say wow, I remember what an impact it had on our lives.
###578 And we'd see that video part over and over again every time
###581 we'd go out and skate.
###582 And I've said this before, I don't think it had anything to
###585 do with cutting edge skateboarding.
###589 But I think it had more to do with the way we were
###592 presenting skateboarding.
###594 It wasn't like we were inventing tricks.
###597 But it was like the stuff we put out, it was quality and it
###600 was genuine.
###603 -I think Valele thought Joey was skating around with a
###605 blunt around on the course.
###608 -I think he thought a lot of our behavior was
###610 inappropriate.
###611 -Back in those days, skateboarders shouldn't
###614 represent themselves that way, which I think is corny.
###617 Because I mean, you look at fucking old Alva Dogtown Days.
###623 We just kind of pulled an Alva move in the '90s, I guess.
###630 Got psyched on ourselves.
###631
