###5 Bioblitz is a partnership that we've had with the National Geographic Society,
###9 
###10 where, we bring together, in a unit of the national park system,
###15 young people,
###16 and scientists,
###18 and park staff,
###19 for a twenty-four-hour intensive
###22 inventory of the natural resources of the park.
###31 Biodiversity
###33 is one of the most important words in the English language.
###36 And Bioblitz is about exploring, understanding, and documenting
###41 the diversity of life,
###42 biodiversity.
###44 And it's for all ages. It's to bring that joy to all ages. From the very youngest to the lifelong
###48 learners.
###50 Many of the kids have
###51 not really experienced what it's like to be in
###54 nature that's less affected by humans. So sometimes it's
###58 the first experience in getting close to people who care and close to the lovely
###63 parts of nature.
###69 They need the experience of actually gathering the materials
###72 and being a part of
###74 everything and they need to know that this is where it all starts,
###78 and we need to preserve it.
###80 And the only way they're going to really remember that is to
###83 actually experience it.
###84 By being in the park. It's like, you know like,
###87 watching a ball game on TV, and it's going to a ball game. They're two
###91 completely different experiences.
###93 And you can learn all the plants' names
###94 and what
###96 they look like in books,
###97 and you come out here in the field
###99 and you might be able to get a few of them but you're not going to be very good.
###102 Because there is just so much variation in nature
###104 that you just can't get it in a textbook.
###111 I'd rather be out here
###111 than in my classroom (laughter).
###114 Well sitting in a classroom
###117 and studying science
###118 is important.
###119 But we've seen time and time again that when you get kids out into the outdoors
###123 
###124 something happens.
###126 Some change occurs in their psychology, that suddenly this is fun.
###132 It's not as dry,
###135 they're having discovery,
###136 and...a sense of wonder.
###138 It's amazing seeing the
###140 different ecosystems, the biodiversity,
###144 and seeing the tundra, which I've never been to before.
###146 I've never even been to Colorado before.
###149 Never really been to many forests. So this is just an amazing experience for me!
###153 It's great for people who have no idea of what is around them
###158 and what is actually happening.
###160 Because, now biodiversity and environment and climate change have been in the
###164 limelight and have been talked about for so long.
###171 Having a scientifically literate society,
###174 has never been more important.
###176 The only way to build an increasingly literate society,
###180 is by getting
###181 kids turned on to science.
###184 Here at Bioblitz you actually get to interact with the animals
###188 and learn about stuff.
###189 And I think for kids, they actually
###192 become really excited
###193 and enthusiastic about...
###195 science.
