1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,683
First of all, I think I'm in love.


2
0:0:2,683 --> 0:0:6,211
Why is it all right for you to have
a boyfriend but not for me?


3
0:0:6,211 --> 0:0:9,464
So long as you live under my roof,
you live by my rules.


4
0:0:9,464 --> 0:0:10,745
Finn's got an admirer.


5
0:0:10,745 --> 0:0:14,419
Who would even send a love letter?
That is so stupid.


6
0:0:14,419 --> 0:0:17,533
Keep your voice down.
This is where I work.


7
0:0:17,533 --> 0:0:21,892
Don't tell me to keep my voice down.


8
0:0:21,892 --> 0:0:24,733
Either we're friends
or we're not friends.


9
0:0:24,733 --> 0:0:28,252
Maybe... I don't want
to be your friend.


10
0:0:28,252 --> 0:0:29,614
We are...


11
0:0:29,614 --> 0:0:31,293
Married!


12
0:0:31,293 --> 0:0:33,13
Can I tell you something?


13
0:0:33,13 --> 0:0:41,88
It was me who sent the letter
to Finn.


14
0:0:41,88 --> 0:0:43,992
Don't mention Friday to anyone.


15
0:0:43,992 --> 0:0:45,671
Why are you looking at me?


16
0:0:45,671 --> 0:0:47,33
I'm looking at everyone.


17
0:0:47,33 --> 0:0:50,592
Don't tell your brothers,
don't tell your sisters,


18
0:0:50,592 --> 0:0:52,193
don't even tell knobheads
from school.


19
0:0:52,193 --> 0:0:53,314
At the end of the day...


20
0:0:53,314 --> 0:0:54,594
'Whatever, Chop.


21
0:0:54,594 --> 0:0:59,755
'Dear Diary, the fight for Finn's
delicious heart has begun.'


22
0:0:59,755 --> 0:1:1,714
'In the red corner, Chloe.


23
0:1:1,714 --> 0:1:4,553
'Seen here looking at Finn
like a black widow


24
0:1:4,553 --> 0:1:7,635
'sizing up how much Gaviscon
she's going to need


25
0:1:7,635 --> 0:1:9,514
'after eating him whole.


26
0:1:9,514 --> 0:1:13,34
'In the blue corner, see me.


27
0:1:13,34 --> 0:1:15,314
'Finn is so out of my league


28
0:1:15,314 --> 0:1:19,409
;that no-one would ever even suspect
I liked him.


29
0:1:19,409 --> 0:1:21,529
'Nay, loved him.


30
0:1:21,529 --> 0:1:26,89
'But since we had had that amazing
heart-to-heart at the party,


31
0:1:26,89 --> 0:1:29,569
'my odds have shortened massively.'


32
0:1:29,569 --> 0:1:31,648
This Friday is between
the six of us.


33
0:1:31,648 --> 0:1:36,729
Put it in the vault, people.
Lock it in the fucking vault.


34
0:1:36,729 --> 0:1:47,849
'We've even developed
a secret mode of communication.'


35
0:1:47,849 --> 0:1:50,294
'I had to use every ounce
of my willpower


36
0:1:50,294 --> 0:1:52,734
'not to move his hand over
just a few inches


37
0:1:52,734 --> 0:1:55,336
'and ask him to write out
all of War And Peace.'


38
0:1:55,336 --> 0:1:58,375
Here you are,
check out this bad ass!


39
0:1:58,375 --> 0:2:0,335
Oh, my God!


40
0:2:0,335 --> 0:2:3,495
Hi, Rae. Hi, Chloe.
Hi, everyone.


41
0:2:3,495 --> 0:2:6,95
Hi.


42
0:2:6,95 --> 0:2:7,696
What are you doing here?


43
0:2:7,696 --> 0:2:11,895
I'm booking the function room
for Saturday.


44
0:2:11,895 --> 0:2:15,695
Oh, Rae's friends.
This is my new husband, Karim.


45
0:2:15,695 --> 0:2:16,935
Congratulations.


46
0:2:16,935 --> 0:2:18,415
Pleased to meet you.


47
0:2:18,415 --> 0:2:21,214
We're getting the marriage blessed
and then we're gonna come here


48
0:2:21,214 --> 0:2:22,774
and have the reception afterwards.


49
0:2:22,774 --> 0:2:25,174
- You're all invited, of course.
- They can't, they're busy.


50
0:2:25,174 --> 0:2:27,896
We're not busy at all.
That's wonderful, Mrs Earl.


51
0:2:27,896 --> 0:2:29,455
Congratulations.


52
0:2:29,455 --> 0:2:33,296
Thank you, Chloe. But actually,
my name is Mrs Bouchtat now.


53
0:2:33,296 --> 0:2:34,815
Oh, Bouchtat.


54
0:2:34,815 --> 0:2:37,855
Does that mean
your name is Rae Bouchtat?


55
0:2:37,855 --> 0:2:40,256
- No, it doesn't.
- This is so exciting.


56
0:2:40,256 --> 0:2:46,575
We can use it as a wind-down session
after the rave.


57
0:2:46,575 --> 0:2:47,935
What did you say?


58
0:2:47,935 --> 0:2:51,95
Nothing.


59
0:2:51,95 --> 0:2:54,688
Did she say "rave"?


60
0:2:54,688 --> 0:3:33,186
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>


61
0:3:33,186 --> 0:3:35,947
How many calories a minute
does high-intensity sex burn?


62
0:3:35,947 --> 0:3:37,26
18.


63
0:3:37,26 --> 0:3:39,987
How long would I have to have sex to
burn off a six-pack of Wagon Wheels?


64
0:3:39,987 --> 0:3:41,95
- Jammy or normal?
- Jammy.


65
0:3:41,95 --> 0:3:44,31
Jammy Wagon Wheels are 167 cal.


66
0:3:44,31 --> 0:3:46,7
Six are 1,002.


67
0:3:46,7 --> 0:3:48,109
18 cal a minute...
Just under an hour.


68
0:3:48,109 --> 0:3:52,59
Ooh! Maybe I should get Dr Nick
to cancel his one o'clock.


69
0:3:52,59 --> 0:3:55,149
Hand jobs are supposed to be
exhausting too.


70
0:3:55,149 --> 0:3:57,789
I've heard you sometimes have to
change arms halfway through.


71
0:3:57,789 --> 0:4:2,15
So what you're saying is
I could essentially sex myself thin.


72
0:4:2,15 --> 0:4:6,69
Well, you could eat two roast
dinners, have sex for an hour,


73
0:4:6,69 --> 0:4:9,989
throw in a couple of hand jobs and
you'd actually be in minus calories.


74
0:4:9,989 --> 0:4:11,942
What is not to like?
Where do I sign?


75
0:4:11,942 --> 0:4:13,341
What day is it?


76
0:4:13,341 --> 0:4:20,381
It's Wednesday, 21 August 1996.


77
0:4:20,381 --> 0:4:23,541
'Dear Diary, I want to be
more like Rae.


78
0:4:23,541 --> 0:4:29,181
'Then my life would be
full of things like boys.


79
0:4:29,181 --> 0:4:32,74
'Rather than things like
how many calories things contain.


80
0:4:32,74 --> 0:4:40,301
'And how to lose those calories.'


81
0:4:40,301 --> 0:4:43,26
I want you to try to drink
at least two of these a day.


82
0:4:43,26 --> 0:4:44,46
They taste like tar.


83
0:4:44,46 --> 0:4:46,5
Tix, your BMI has dropped again.


84
0:4:46,5 --> 0:4:48,22
It's dropped significantly.


85
0:4:48,22 --> 0:4:50,62
You've become in danger
of falling very ill, OK?


86
0:4:50,62 --> 0:4:54,701
There is a risk of organ failure,
of heart problems, hormone problems,


87
0:4:54,701 --> 0:4:58,61
problems with your brain.


88
0:4:58,61 --> 0:5:0,2
Angie says you're refusing solids.


89
0:5:0,2 --> 0:5:1,78
I don't like people watching me eat.


90
0:5:1,78 --> 0:5:3,582
You are on supervised eating, Tix.


91
0:5:3,582 --> 0:5:7,621
It's her job to watch you eat.


92
0:5:7,621 --> 0:5:9,58
If you don't start eating
in the next few days,


93
0:5:9,58 --> 0:5:11,102
if your weight doesn't stabilise,


94
0:5:11,102 --> 0:5:15,981
I'll have to put you
on a tube feed, Tix.


95
0:5:15,981 --> 0:5:19,62
I really, really don't want
to have to do that.


96
0:5:19,62 --> 0:5:20,421
Do you understand?


97
0:5:20,421 --> 0:5:27,861
Yeah.


98
0:5:27,861 --> 0:5:33,141
So how have you been
since our last session?


99
0:5:33,141 --> 0:5:37,661
Are you scared?


100
0:5:37,661 --> 0:5:42,101
You have to let go, Tix.


101
0:5:42,101 --> 0:5:45,461
It's OK to lose control... sometimes.


102
0:5:45,461 --> 0:5:47,142
You don't have to worry
all the time,


103
0:5:47,142 --> 0:5:50,701
you don't have to count calories.


104
0:5:50,701 --> 0:5:55,621
Tell me something
that makes you feel good.


105
0:5:55,621 --> 0:5:58,501
Anything.


106
0:5:58,501 --> 0:5:59,581
Rae.


107
0:5:59,581 --> 0:6:0,781
Rae, great.


108
0:6:0,781 --> 0:6:8,341
So, supposing I set up a date
between you and Rae for dinner.


109
0:6:8,341 --> 0:6:12,141
She'd like that. I'd like that.


110
0:6:12,141 --> 0:6:13,702
It would have to be Rae, though.


111
0:6:13,702 --> 0:6:16,901
Hm.


112
0:6:16,901 --> 0:6:19,302
Because I said no
and that means no.


113
0:6:19,302 --> 0:6:21,461
But everyone's going.


114
0:6:21,461 --> 0:6:25,701
It's not like an illegal rave anyway.
It's more like a big dance event.


115
0:6:25,701 --> 0:6:26,941
You're not going.


116
0:6:26,941 --> 0:6:31,301
I know sometimes I tell you to do
things and you ignore me, right,


117
0:6:31,301 --> 0:6:33,82
well, this isn't going to be
one of those times.


118
0:6:33,82 --> 0:6:36,1
Anyway, what do you think
Kester would say


119
0:6:36,1 --> 0:6:38,302
if you told him you were going
to a rave?


120
0:6:38,302 --> 0:6:41,621
He'd say, "Go for it." I know Kester.


121
0:6:41,621 --> 0:6:45,221
And he would love the idea
of me enjoying myself.


122
0:6:45,221 --> 0:6:46,982
Cos he's not a complete ball-breaker.


123
0:6:46,982 --> 0:6:48,821
Thank you, I'm not deaf.


124
0:6:48,821 --> 0:6:59,21
Right, how does it look?


125
0:6:59,21 --> 0:7:0,421
Oh, great!


126
0:7:0,421 --> 0:7:5,421
I look like a cross between a
profiterole and a prolapsed colon.


127
0:7:5,421 --> 0:7:12,621
I love it, I absolutely love it.


128
0:7:12,621 --> 0:7:14,621
Mmm.


129
0:7:14,621 --> 0:7:16,141
Oh!


130
0:7:16,141 --> 0:7:17,742
Well, what about this one?


131
0:7:17,742 --> 0:7:19,101
It's too expensive.


132
0:7:19,101 --> 0:7:20,941
But I love it.


133
0:7:20,941 --> 0:7:24,6
If everyone is going to be there,
I have to look nice.


134
0:7:24,6 --> 0:7:26,18
Right, Rae, when I say no
to something,


135
0:7:26,18 --> 0:7:27,9
it doesn't mean keep arguing,


136
0:7:27,9 --> 0:7:32,581
it means end of discussion!


137
0:7:32,581 --> 0:7:34,18
I think I'm going to be sick.


138
0:7:34,18 --> 0:7:40,701
Oh, don't be so dramatic.


139
0:7:40,701 --> 0:7:44,741
'You always wonder what it would be
like to sit in front of a doctor


140
0:7:44,741 --> 0:7:46,822
'and hear the worst possible news.


141
0:7:46,822 --> 0:7:50,741
'How you'd cope, how you'd feel.'


142
0:7:50,741 --> 0:7:53,142
Rae, I'm afraid you're going to have
to stop drinking alcohol.


143
0:7:53,142 --> 0:7:54,821
Why?


144
0:7:54,821 --> 0:7:57,14
The meds we switched you to,
some people feel nauseous


145
0:7:57,14 --> 0:7:58,98
if they drink on them,
especially at first.


146
0:7:58,98 --> 0:8:1,34
- Right, so it's nothing serious.
- What?


147
0:8:1,34 --> 0:8:3,1
I want to go back to the old ones.


148
0:8:3,1 --> 0:8:6,18
No, I wasn't happy with the SSRIs.
You said they make you feel drowsy.


149
0:8:6,18 --> 0:8:8,3
I'd rather feel drowsy
than feel sick.


150
0:8:8,3 --> 0:8:10,902
No, it's fine,
she can just give up the booze.


151
0:8:10,902 --> 0:8:13,381
- This is bullshit.
- Rae!


152
0:8:13,381 --> 0:8:15,58
We can review your meds
in the next few weeks,


153
0:8:15,58 --> 0:8:21,301
but changing them or stopping them
now is not a good idea.


154
0:8:21,301 --> 0:8:25,501
Oh, Dr Nick, I meant to say.
I got married last week.


155
0:8:25,501 --> 0:8:27,102
Oh, wow, great, congratulations!


156
0:8:27,102 --> 0:8:29,501
Are we all right?


157
0:8:29,501 --> 0:8:33,141
Yeah.


158
0:8:33,141 --> 0:8:39,981
Ohh!


159
0:8:39,981 --> 0:8:43,382
'When you're sick, you don't belong
to yourself any more.


160
0:8:43,382 --> 0:8:45,341
'You don't get a say.


161
0:8:45,341 --> 0:8:49,781
'Every doctor is another parent,
every ward another classroom,


162
0:8:49,781 --> 0:9:7,981
'every pill another piece of their
bollocks that you have to swallow.'


163
0:9:7,981 --> 0:9:9,781
'So that was it. No booze


164
0:9:9,781 --> 0:9:26,581
'because of my pills and no rave
because of my cowbag of a mum.'


165
0:9:26,581 --> 0:9:34,621
'You never know,
maybe the rave would be shit.


166
0:9:34,621 --> 0:9:36,181
'Who was I kidding?


167
0:9:36,181 --> 0:9:40,701
'It was gonna be fuckin' amazing.
The perfect opportunity


168
0:9:40,701 --> 0:9:42,46
'to lick the fillings from his teeth,


169
0:9:42,46 --> 0:9:45,742
'to suck on his fingers,
to grab hold of his firm...'


170
0:9:45,742 --> 0:9:49,461
Rae, what are you thinking about?


171
0:9:49,461 --> 0:9:51,861
I'm thinking...


172
0:9:51,861 --> 0:9:55,1
how I'm going to tell you
that you smell of BO.


173
0:9:55,1 --> 0:9:58,741
I'm sure you'll find something
to say.


174
0:9:58,741 --> 0:10:2,821
Oh, shit! There's Kendo.


175
0:10:2,821 --> 0:10:4,61
Who's Kendo?


176
0:10:4,61 --> 0:10:6,701
Some twat dealer from Dalehead.


177
0:10:6,701 --> 0:10:8,22
Do I look all right?


178
0:10:8,22 --> 0:10:13,901
What do you mean, "Do I look all
right"? He's a scumbag.


179
0:10:13,901 --> 0:10:15,301
All right, ladies?


180
0:10:15,301 --> 0:10:16,542
All right, Chopper?


181
0:10:16,542 --> 0:10:17,781
All right, Kendo?


182
0:10:17,781 --> 0:10:23,501
Tell your fuckin' brother I'm gonna
smash his face in when I see him


183
0:10:23,501 --> 0:10:25,702
I'm only joking.
How is the cunt?


184
0:10:25,702 --> 0:10:28,821
He's all right.


185
0:10:28,821 --> 0:10:30,46
Do you want some pills for Friday?


186
0:10:30,46 --> 0:10:31,422
Yeah, yeah, sounds good.


187
0:10:31,422 --> 0:10:35,581
Drop round tomorrow and I'll see
what I can do for you.


188
0:10:35,581 --> 0:10:43,301
In a bit.
See you later, girls.


189
0:10:43,301 --> 0:10:46,261
What are you getting drugs for?


190
0:10:46,261 --> 0:10:49,702
- It's a rave, innit?
- Finn, can I get a ride on
the back of your scooter?


191
0:10:49,702 --> 0:10:51,941
Yeah, course, no problem.


192
0:10:51,941 --> 0:10:54,18
There's room for you to all go
in the one car.


193
0:10:54,18 --> 0:10:55,422
What are you talking about?


194
0:10:55,422 --> 0:10:57,381
I'm not going.


195
0:10:57,381 --> 0:10:59,61
What?
Why?


196
0:10:59,61 --> 0:11:2,221
Is it because of your mum?


197
0:11:2,221 --> 0:11:3,94
I'm not going if Rae's not going.


198
0:11:3,94 --> 0:11:5,38
I'm not going if Rae's not going.


199
0:11:5,38 --> 0:11:8,582
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no.
No-one is backing out of this.


200
0:11:8,582 --> 0:11:9,941
Rae?


201
0:11:9,941 --> 0:11:14,781
Come here.


202
0:11:14,781 --> 0:11:18,61
Rae, what's going on?


203
0:11:18,61 --> 0:11:19,981
My mum won't let me go.


204
0:11:19,981 --> 0:11:22,501
Rae, listen to everyone.


205
0:11:22,501 --> 0:11:24,341
You've got to go.


206
0:11:24,341 --> 0:11:28,1
Right, you're always being reminded
about how sick you were.


207
0:11:28,1 --> 0:11:29,902
It's just making you worse.


208
0:11:29,902 --> 0:11:36,861
You even said yourself,
you're getting better.


209
0:11:36,861 --> 0:11:39,981
You know,
you and Finn are getting close.


210
0:11:39,981 --> 0:11:41,741
Yeah. He's a good laugh.


211
0:11:41,741 --> 0:11:44,981
Does he ever mention me?


212
0:11:44,981 --> 0:11:46,6
I don't know really.


213
0:11:46,6 --> 0:11:48,46
What do you reckon he'd do
if I tried to kiss him?


214
0:11:48,46 --> 0:11:50,262
How should I know what he'd do?


215
0:11:50,262 --> 0:11:53,661
Can you imagine sleeping with him?


216
0:11:53,661 --> 0:11:54,982
You'd need a fucking bib.


217
0:11:54,982 --> 0:11:57,541
That's disgusting.


218
0:11:57,541 --> 0:11:59,86
It's what you said about Jarvis
Cocker last week.


219
0:11:59,86 --> 0:12:1,9
- It's still disgusting.
- Well, you're disgusting.


220
0:12:1,9 --> 0:12:4,862
Right, I'm off. Rae, come round
to mine tomorrow if you want.


221
0:12:4,862 --> 0:12:6,21
Why?


222
0:12:6,21 --> 0:12:9,62
Because I've got some really crap
reggae I want to show you.


223
0:12:9,62 --> 0:12:20,301
And you can give me
some personal hygiene tips.


224
0:12:20,301 --> 0:12:23,145
'Round one to me.'


225
0:12:23,145 --> 0:12:26,942
Rachel, come name...
Special bird for you.


226
0:12:26,942 --> 0:12:27,982
No, thanks.


227
0:12:27,982 --> 0:12:32,582
Oh, Rae, come and name a bird.


228
0:12:32,582 --> 0:12:34,302
Oh!


229
0:12:34,302 --> 0:12:37,342
Ah! What's the matter with you?


230
0:12:37,342 --> 0:12:40,61
You're not still in a mood, are you,
about that rave?


231
0:12:40,61 --> 0:12:41,313
I'd like to see Kester's face


232
0:12:41,313 --> 0:12:43,953
if he thought I was letting you go
to a rave.


233
0:12:43,953 --> 0:12:46,995
Stop pretending like you know him.
I already told you,


234
0:12:46,995 --> 0:12:49,434
he wants me to have a life.


235
0:12:49,434 --> 0:12:52,674
Are you going to name this bird
or not?


236
0:12:52,674 --> 0:12:54,753
You know, they might not even
like each other


237
0:12:54,753 --> 0:12:56,993
and you've got them
all cooped up together.


238
0:12:56,993 --> 0:12:59,833
- Well, a lot of us have to live like that, so...
- It doesn't make it right.


239
0:12:59,833 --> 0:13:1,824
You shouldn't cage up wild animals.


240
0:13:1,824 --> 0:13:2,906
Just name the bird!


241
0:13:2,906 --> 0:13:8,945
Fine!


242
0:13:8,945 --> 0:13:10,745
He's called Mandela.


243
0:13:10,745 --> 0:13:12,185
Mandela.


244
0:13:12,185 --> 0:13:14,945
That's like Nelson.


245
0:13:14,945 --> 0:13:24,265
I like.


246
0:13:24,265 --> 0:13:26,26
'So are you go to
the rave tomorrow?'


247
0:13:26,26 --> 0:13:27,825
It doesn't look like it.


248
0:13:27,825 --> 0:13:29,146
Will you go out with me?


249
0:13:29,146 --> 0:13:30,465
Where?


250
0:13:30,465 --> 0:13:32,664
'In the hospital. A dinner date.'


251
0:13:32,664 --> 0:13:35,104
I'm going to try
and have some proper food.


252
0:13:35,104 --> 0:13:37,386
'Kester says I need
to lose control.'


253
0:13:37,386 --> 0:13:39,945
Oh, I love Kester for saying that.


254
0:13:39,945 --> 0:13:42,465
How do I lose control?


255
0:13:42,465 --> 0:13:46,265
Do something that you've always
wanted to do,


256
0:13:46,265 --> 0:13:51,705
but you've been too scared of.


257
0:13:51,705 --> 0:13:53,306
Can you think of anything?


258
0:13:53,306 --> 0:14:0,665
Maybe.


259
0:14:0,665 --> 0:14:2,505
Hiya, Tix. Hiya.


260
0:14:2,505 --> 0:14:3,985
What are you up to?


261
0:14:3,985 --> 0:14:10,865
A bit of admin.


262
0:14:10,865 --> 0:14:13,226
Do you fancy going to the lake
with me later?


263
0:14:13,226 --> 0:14:14,585
Me?
Yeah.


264
0:14:14,585 --> 0:14:16,145
OK. Cool. What time?


265
0:14:16,145 --> 0:14:25,25
- Four-ish?
- Four-ish, OK, cool.


266
0:14:25,25 --> 0:14:27,905
'Even his house was a bit sexy.


267
0:14:27,905 --> 0:14:29,465
'Oh, God, stop!


268
0:14:29,465 --> 0:14:33,825
'No craziness. Stop the craziness.


269
0:14:33,825 --> 0:14:35,545
'I'm breathing too deep.


270
0:14:35,545 --> 0:14:37,545
'I'm hyperventilating.


271
0:14:37,545 --> 0:14:41,265
'Put your hands on something flat.'


272
0:14:41,265 --> 0:14:45,665
I pulled a hamstring.
Just stretching it out.


273
0:14:45,665 --> 0:14:46,946
Come up to my room.


274
0:14:46,946 --> 0:14:52,25
If my dad sees you,
he'll bend your ear for weeks.


275
0:14:52,25 --> 0:14:53,745
'His bedroom?


276
0:14:53,745 --> 0:14:55,385
'My God!


277
0:14:55,385 --> 0:14:59,705
'This was it.


278
0:14:59,705 --> 0:15:12,866
'About to enter the lion's den.'


279
0:15:12,866 --> 0:15:16,25
Hi.


280
0:15:16,25 --> 0:15:19,545
'Round two.'


281
0:15:19,545 --> 0:15:22,824
Well, I didn't want to miss out
on listening to some reggae.


282
0:15:22,824 --> 0:15:24,224
Yeah, cos you love reggae.


283
0:15:24,224 --> 0:15:26,466
I don't particularly like
any type of music best.


284
0:15:26,466 --> 0:15:28,625
I just like good music.


285
0:15:28,625 --> 0:15:34,505
You know.


286
0:15:34,505 --> 0:15:35,786
Finn, I love this song.


287
0:15:35,786 --> 0:15:38,225
Who do you like best, Chloe?


288
0:15:38,225 --> 0:15:41,26
Morrissey, or the lead singer
of the Smiths?


289
0:15:41,26 --> 0:15:45,25
Well, it depends what mood I'm in.


290
0:15:45,25 --> 0:15:46,425
What?


291
0:15:46,425 --> 0:15:50,625
'In your face, Chloe!'


292
0:15:50,625 --> 0:15:51,666
Right, who wants a beer?


293
0:15:51,666 --> 0:15:54,25
- I will.
- Rae?


294
0:15:54,25 --> 0:15:55,866
- No, I'm all right.
- Serious?


295
0:15:55,866 --> 0:15:59,105
Come on, Rea. Don't be boring.


296
0:15:59,105 --> 0:16:15,505
Don't be a weirdo.


297
0:16:15,505 --> 0:16:17,824
'I can't believe I asked a boy out.


298
0:16:17,824 --> 0:16:20,584
'Finally, I'm going to be able to
talk to Rea about kissing


299
0:16:20,584 --> 0:16:23,425
'and sex things and flirting
and love.'


300
0:16:23,425 --> 0:16:33,385
'Just like a normal girl.


301
0:16:33,385 --> 0:17:3,185
'Maybe I can be normal.'


302
0:17:3,185 --> 0:17:7,265
So what about Rae, then?
Is your mum not letting you go?


303
0:17:7,265 --> 0:17:8,785
It's complicated.


304
0:17:8,785 --> 0:17:10,504
It would be shit if you don't come.


305
0:17:10,504 --> 0:17:12,784
Well, the rest of the gang
are still going.


306
0:17:12,784 --> 0:17:14,424
You're still going
to have a good time.


307
0:17:14,424 --> 0:17:16,906
The rest of the gang would fall
apart if you're not there.


308
0:17:16,906 --> 0:17:20,465
You are the gang.
No, I mean that, Rae.


309
0:17:20,465 --> 0:17:22,864
Everyone else has got
too much stuff going on.


310
0:17:22,864 --> 0:17:24,746
You're the most, you know, normal.


311
0:17:24,746 --> 0:17:26,585
That's bollocks.


312
0:17:26,585 --> 0:17:28,945
It's true!


313
0:17:28,945 --> 0:17:31,706
Anyway, you've got to go. I won't
take no for an answer because...


314
0:17:31,706 --> 0:18:4,705
Because what?


315
0:18:4,705 --> 0:18:6,946
- Are you OK?
- No, I just, um...


316
0:18:6,946 --> 0:18:9,185
What's up?


317
0:18:9,185 --> 0:18:10,785
I don't feel very well.


318
0:18:10,785 --> 0:18:16,905
Well, d'you want me to see
if my dad will give you a lift home?


319
0:18:16,905 --> 0:18:19,745
'Oh, God! No vomitorium!'


320
0:18:19,745 --> 0:18:21,185
You'll like this.


321
0:18:21,185 --> 0:18:37,825
I got really bladdered
at a Status Quo concert once.


322
0:18:37,825 --> 0:18:41,985
'Round two to Chloe.'


323
0:18:41,985 --> 0:18:43,505
'Just relax.


324
0:18:43,505 --> 0:18:46,265
'He's just a boy.


325
0:18:46,265 --> 0:18:49,265
'Rae would say something funny.


326
0:18:49,265 --> 0:18:51,66
'Maybe I should tell a joke?


327
0:18:51,66 --> 0:18:52,225
'No.


328
0:18:52,225 --> 0:18:54,865
'Don't tell any jokes.


329
0:18:54,865 --> 0:18:56,905
'Just make conversation.'


330
0:18:56,905 --> 0:19:1,705
What do you want to talk about?


331
0:19:1,705 --> 0:19:2,865
Ducks.


332
0:19:2,865 --> 0:19:6,65
They're one of my favourite things,
ducks.


333
0:19:6,65 --> 0:19:9,386
I mean, when you think about a duck,
they're just so...


334
0:19:9,386 --> 0:19:10,465
chilled out.


335
0:19:10,465 --> 0:19:13,304
They're not chilled out.
I've seen them fight.


336
0:19:13,304 --> 0:19:15,464
Yeah, but once they've done
flapping their wings


337
0:19:15,464 --> 0:19:16,826
and splashing about and stuff,


338
0:19:16,826 --> 0:19:22,145
they just go back to being
so... chilled out.


339
0:19:22,145 --> 0:19:24,26
- Hey, d'you know what we should do?
- What?


340
0:19:24,26 --> 0:19:26,65
We should become ducks.


341
0:19:26,65 --> 0:19:34,425
We'd go into the pond.


342
0:19:34,425 --> 0:19:37,346
Danny, no,
they'll see you from the windows.


343
0:19:37,346 --> 0:19:44,945
I fear nothing.


344
0:19:44,945 --> 0:19:48,585
Come on, then.


345
0:19:48,585 --> 0:19:52,225
'Lose control.


346
0:19:52,225 --> 0:19:54,305
'Let go.


347
0:19:54,305 --> 0:19:56,465
'Lose control.


348
0:19:56,465 --> 0:19:59,145
'Let go.


349
0:19:59,145 --> 0:20:0,425
'Lose control.


350
0:20:0,425 --> 0:20:1,705
'Let go.


351
0:20:1,705 --> 0:20:3,665
'Lose control.


352
0:20:3,665 --> 0:20:4,825
'Let go.


353
0:20:4,825 --> 0:20:10,465
'Lose control.'


354
0:20:10,465 --> 0:20:24,265
Come on.


355
0:20:24,265 --> 0:20:28,225
Oh, shit!


356
0:20:28,225 --> 0:20:31,105
'Fucking pills! Fucking doctors!


357
0:20:31,105 --> 0:20:36,505
'How was I supposed to compete for
Finn when I couldn't go anywhere,


358
0:20:36,505 --> 0:20:43,345
'couldn't do anything?


359
0:20:43,345 --> 0:20:46,986
'At least there was one adult
on the planet who understood.'


360
0:20:46,986 --> 0:20:48,985
It's a load of crap.


361
0:20:48,985 --> 0:20:50,385
I mean, I'm 16.


362
0:20:50,385 --> 0:20:52,425
Everyone else is going.


363
0:20:52,425 --> 0:20:55,904
And she's all like, "Oh, you can't go
because you're different.


364
0:20:55,904 --> 0:21:0,185
"You shouldn't be exposing yourself
to that kind of situation."


365
0:21:0,185 --> 0:21:2,585
She even used you in an argument.


366
0:21:2,585 --> 0:21:5,105
"Oh, think of what Kester would say."


367
0:21:5,105 --> 0:21:7,105
What did she think I'd say?


368
0:21:7,105 --> 0:21:10,665
She said that you would think
it was a bad idea.


369
0:21:10,665 --> 0:21:13,744
But she doesn't know about everything
we talk about in here.


370
0:21:13,744 --> 0:21:16,504
She doesn't know about
all the work we've done


371
0:21:16,504 --> 0:21:18,504
on me being brave and confident.


372
0:21:18,504 --> 0:21:21,586
She just reminds me
that I'm ill all the time.


373
0:21:21,586 --> 0:21:23,425
I agree with your mum.


374
0:21:23,425 --> 0:21:26,625
I think it's a terrible idea.


375
0:21:26,625 --> 0:21:27,664
You don't think that.


376
0:21:27,664 --> 0:21:29,624
You're recovering
from a serious illness.


377
0:21:29,624 --> 0:21:30,866
If you'd broken your leg,


378
0:21:30,866 --> 0:21:36,425
would you try and run a marathon
two months later?


379
0:21:36,425 --> 0:21:38,584
Do you still think I'm a mess, then?


380
0:21:38,584 --> 0:21:40,344
I don't think you're a mess.


381
0:21:40,344 --> 0:21:42,826
I think you need
to take care of yourself.


382
0:21:42,826 --> 0:21:49,905
I need to take myself?


383
0:21:49,905 --> 0:21:52,185
Who were you arguing with?


384
0:21:52,185 --> 0:21:54,985
Last week in the car park.


385
0:21:54,985 --> 0:21:57,185
I saw you.


386
0:21:57,185 --> 0:22:0,105
Was it your wife?


387
0:22:0,105 --> 0:22:2,985
How am I supposed to listen
to someone


388
0:22:2,985 --> 0:22:5,865
whose life is a bigger mess
than mine?


389
0:22:5,865 --> 0:22:8,704
What is even the point
of these sessions, seriously?


390
0:22:8,704 --> 0:22:10,704
To find out what pushed you
over the edge


391
0:22:10,704 --> 0:22:12,544
and to stop it from happening again.


392
0:22:12,544 --> 0:22:14,184
Oh, you're always asking questions.


393
0:22:14,184 --> 0:22:16,586
"Why did you hurt yourself?
Why did you go crazy?"


394
0:22:16,586 --> 0:22:19,665
Sometimes there is no why.
I just did.


395
0:22:19,665 --> 0:22:23,426
And being here and being asked
about it every bloody day


396
0:22:23,426 --> 0:22:25,425
is what's keeping it alive.


397
0:22:25,425 --> 0:22:27,306
Look, I know this is painful...


398
0:22:27,306 --> 0:22:34,305
Are you even listening to me?


399
0:22:34,305 --> 0:22:37,385
I was bored.


400
0:22:37,385 --> 0:22:39,825
I was lonely.


401
0:22:39,825 --> 0:22:41,505
I had no mates.


402
0:22:41,505 --> 0:22:46,105
Now I'm finally popular.


403
0:22:46,105 --> 0:22:52,865
And you just want to make me
feel different again.


404
0:22:52,865 --> 0:22:54,944
I don't want to come here any more.


405
0:22:54,944 --> 0:22:56,824
You are not obliged to come here,
Rae.


406
0:22:56,824 --> 0:22:59,24
But I think it would be a bad idea.


407
0:22:59,24 --> 0:23:1,984
I think we're making some real...
progress here. I think...


408
0:23:1,984 --> 0:23:4,906
What would happen if I walked out
of the door right now


409
0:23:4,906 --> 0:23:7,865
and never came back?


410
0:23:7,865 --> 0:23:13,385
Aren't you going to try and say
something insightful to make me stay?


411
0:23:13,385 --> 0:23:16,465
Do you think perhaps...


412
0:23:16,465 --> 0:23:19,504
..your anger is born
out of frustration with yourself?


413
0:23:19,504 --> 0:23:26,105
That you're angry and frustrated
with yourself for being ill?


414
0:23:26,105 --> 0:24:11,385
You see, that is not something
you are entirely responsible for.


415
0:24:11,385 --> 0:25:9,289
I don't half bloody love you,
beastie.


416
0:25:9,289 --> 0:25:12,335
'Friday, the 23rd of August.


417
0:25:12,335 --> 0:25:19,815
'Dear Diary...


418
0:25:19,815 --> 0:25:28,55
'Oh, bollocks to it!'


419
0:25:28,55 --> 0:25:38,95
Morning.


420
0:25:38,95 --> 0:25:45,15
Morning.


421
0:25:45,15 --> 0:26:19,15
What?


422
0:26:19,15 --> 0:26:22,495
What happened?


423
0:26:22,495 --> 0:26:24,455
What happened?


424
0:26:24,455 --> 0:26:27,802
Someone let all the birds
out of the cage.


425
0:26:27,802 --> 0:26:29,481
That's what happened.


426
0:26:29,481 --> 0:26:31,177
Who did?


427
0:26:31,177 --> 0:26:35,337
Why would someone do such a thing?
I don't know.


428
0:26:35,337 --> 0:26:38,18
Maybe you could tell me
why someone would do such a thing.


429
0:26:38,18 --> 0:26:40,337
Oh, my...!


430
0:26:40,337 --> 0:26:42,378
Do you want to tell me
why you did it?


431
0:26:42,378 --> 0:26:45,257
Well, I didn't know that they'd die.


432
0:26:45,257 --> 0:26:48,178
Well, what did you think they'd do?
Fly back to the Bahamas?


433
0:26:48,178 --> 0:26:50,617
Check in at the local RSPB?


434
0:26:50,617 --> 0:26:53,17
Karim is in bits.


435
0:26:53,17 --> 0:26:56,256
He built this because he doesn't
know many people here.


436
0:26:56,256 --> 0:27:0,216
He wanted a project, something nice,
so he didn't feel so trapped.


437
0:27:0,216 --> 0:27:2,296
I did it because they
shouldn't be in a cage.


438
0:27:2,296 --> 0:27:3,936
They're birds, they're not toys.


439
0:27:3,936 --> 0:27:6,58
No, you did it to get back at me


440
0:27:6,58 --> 0:27:9,417
for not letting you go to the rave,
didn't you?


441
0:27:9,417 --> 0:27:12,936
Well, is it any wonder I won't let
you go when you do things like this?


442
0:27:12,936 --> 0:27:14,738
When you behave like a mental case?


443
0:27:14,738 --> 0:27:17,257
Don't call me a mental case.


444
0:27:17,257 --> 0:27:20,16
But... you know what I meant.
Don't you ever


445
0:27:20,16 --> 0:27:21,738
call me a fuckin' mental case.


446
0:27:21,738 --> 0:27:24,937
Don't talk to me like that, Rae.
I'm your mum.


447
0:27:24,937 --> 0:27:28,16
I meant you need to start
behaving like an adult


448
0:27:28,16 --> 0:27:30,656
instead of behaving like a child.
Yeah?


449
0:27:30,656 --> 0:27:34,817
Well, maybe you need to start
behaving like my mum instead of


450
0:27:34,817 --> 0:27:40,137
behaving like a twat.


451
0:27:40,137 --> 0:27:42,937
Oh, I'm sorry, Rae.


452
0:27:42,937 --> 0:27:59,137
Save it.


453
0:27:59,137 --> 0:28:1,97
Where are you going?


454
0:28:1,97 --> 0:28:3,177
I don't know, anywhere.


455
0:28:3,177 --> 0:28:5,177
Away from you, away from him.


456
0:28:5,177 --> 0:28:7,738
Rae, don't go.
Let's talk about this.


457
0:28:7,738 --> 0:28:10,697
I'm really sorry.


458
0:28:10,697 --> 0:28:13,977
Why don't you slap me
and then we're even?


459
0:28:13,977 --> 0:28:16,257
I don't want to slap you.


460
0:28:16,257 --> 0:28:32,257
I don't even want to look at you.


461
0:28:32,257 --> 0:28:36,256
'I'd always known I'd have to run
away from home at some point.


462
0:28:36,256 --> 0:28:39,216
'I'd always planned
that I don't stop at Chloe's.


463
0:28:39,216 --> 0:28:45,977
'We'd be like sisters.
I'd have a normal family.'


464
0:28:45,977 --> 0:29:11,497
'But things change.'


465
0:29:11,497 --> 0:29:15,617
There you go.


466
0:29:15,617 --> 0:29:20,257
Tea makes everything all right.


467
0:29:20,257 --> 0:29:23,218
I reckon it'll be all right,
you know, in a couple of days.


468
0:29:23,218 --> 0:29:28,17
When you've both had some space
or whatever.


469
0:29:28,17 --> 0:29:29,738
Thanks for letting me stop.


470
0:29:29,738 --> 0:29:31,377
It's all right.


471
0:29:31,377 --> 0:29:34,336
My dad's ironing the sheets
for the spare room as we speak.


472
0:29:34,336 --> 0:29:35,778
Oh, please don't let him do that.


473
0:29:35,778 --> 0:29:39,97
I wouldn't try and stop him.


474
0:29:39,97 --> 0:29:40,616
So what time's the rave?


475
0:29:40,616 --> 0:29:42,416
We'll probably set off
in about an hour.


476
0:29:42,416 --> 0:29:44,138
Why, are you thinking of coming?


477
0:29:44,138 --> 0:29:48,137
No. No, I'm not.


478
0:29:48,137 --> 0:29:50,136
It would mess up all the lifts
and stuff anyway.


479
0:29:50,136 --> 0:29:52,818
Would it bollocks, no! I'll tell
Chloe to jump in with Chop.


480
0:29:52,818 --> 0:30:2,324
And you can get on the scooter
with me.


481
0:30:2,324 --> 0:30:4,763
'I can't even dip my toe
in a pond.


482
0:30:4,763 --> 0:30:8,283
'I can't even lose control enough
to get my feet wet.


483
0:30:8,283 --> 0:30:9,603
'I'll never be normal.


484
0:30:9,603 --> 0:30:13,532
'I'll never be able to talk to Rae
about kissing and flirting and love.


485
0:30:13,532 --> 0:30:15,51
'I'll never be like...'


486
0:30:15,51 --> 0:30:18,407
- Rae?
- It's me.


487
0:30:18,407 --> 0:30:20,38
What are you doing in here?


488
0:30:20,38 --> 0:30:21,66
Hiding.


489
0:30:21,66 --> 0:30:23,581
Why, what are you doing in here?


490
0:30:23,581 --> 0:30:26,46
Hiding.


491
0:30:26,46 --> 0:30:31,62
I thought you'd be getting ready
your big date with Rae.


492
0:30:31,62 --> 0:30:33,62
I'm not going.


493
0:30:33,62 --> 0:30:37,82
Please don't try
and convince me to go.


494
0:30:37,82 --> 0:30:43,3
I once treated a young boy,
he was about seven years old.


495
0:30:43,3 --> 0:30:46,19
He used to pull down on his
testicles whenever he was upset.


496
0:30:46,19 --> 0:30:51,34
I mean really yank down,
it was truly eye-watering to behold.


497
0:30:51,34 --> 0:30:55,94
Then one day,
I asked him a difficult question.


498
0:30:55,94 --> 0:31:0,9
He pulled down so hard upon them
that he had to go to hospital.


499
0:31:0,9 --> 0:31:3,34
That's crazy.


500
0:31:3,34 --> 0:31:6,73
You'd be surprised what lengths
people will go to


501
0:31:6,73 --> 0:31:7,395
not to face what's real


502
0:31:7,395 --> 0:31:10,674
and painful inside them.


503
0:31:10,674 --> 0:31:13,234
But then, that's what my job is.


504
0:31:13,234 --> 0:31:16,154
I'm essentially a torturer.


505
0:31:16,154 --> 0:31:18,595
This is where you say
that I'm not a torturer,


506
0:31:18,595 --> 0:31:21,394
that I'm actually quite lovely.


507
0:31:21,394 --> 0:31:25,194
My methods of torture
are asking you to trust people.


508
0:31:25,194 --> 0:31:27,514
Asking you to lose control.


509
0:31:27,514 --> 0:31:32,594
But if I'd been treated the way
you have been treated by people...


510
0:31:32,594 --> 0:31:34,113
..I'd want to sit in a toilet


511
0:31:34,113 --> 0:31:36,715
and hide away from
the rest of the world as well.


512
0:31:36,715 --> 0:31:40,714
You are sitting in a toilet.


513
0:31:40,714 --> 0:31:42,555
It's really quite nice, actually.


514
0:31:42,555 --> 0:31:45,794
I can see why you and Rae
hang out here.


515
0:31:45,794 --> 0:31:48,914
I do trust people, you know.


516
0:31:48,914 --> 0:31:50,554
I trust Rae.


517
0:31:50,554 --> 0:33:48,34
Well, then maybe you should
have dinner with her.


518
0:33:48,34 --> 0:33:50,354
Are you all right?


519
0:33:50,354 --> 0:33:54,314
Listen, try and have a good night.
Enjoy yourself.


520
0:33:54,314 --> 0:33:56,794
Er, what's going on with you two?


521
0:33:56,794 --> 0:33:58,953
What do you mean?
You look like a couple.


522
0:33:58,953 --> 0:34:25,434
Come on, Chloe, we look like
a better couple than they do.


523
0:34:25,434 --> 0:34:28,34
I've got one for everyone.


524
0:34:28,34 --> 0:34:31,314
You fucking know this, come on.


525
0:34:31,314 --> 0:34:33,594
Finn?
No, I'm all right.


526
0:34:33,594 --> 0:34:35,474
Chloe?
No way.


527
0:34:35,474 --> 0:34:37,193
What are you doing?
Taking a pill.


528
0:34:37,193 --> 0:34:39,833
What, you hate drugs.
You don't take drugs.


529
0:34:39,833 --> 0:34:41,433
You said there was one for everyone.


530
0:34:41,433 --> 0:34:42,875
Not for you, you're different.


531
0:34:42,875 --> 0:34:47,794
Why am I different?
Rae, are you in?


532
0:34:47,794 --> 0:34:55,544
Ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines.


533
0:34:55,544 --> 0:34:57,733
What's the point in keeping
a diary


534
0:34:57,733 --> 0:35:0,295
when you're too scared
to even do anything?


535
0:35:0,295 --> 0:35:2,294
When your life is boring?


536
0:35:2,294 --> 0:35:8,374
When the only things you know are
how many calories things contain?


537
0:35:8,374 --> 0:35:39,934
And how to lose them?


538
0:35:39,934 --> 0:35:43,614
Oh, my God, Rae!
I can't believe you dropped a pill.


539
0:35:43,614 --> 0:35:47,574
Yeah, well, you're the one
that told me to chill.


540
0:35:47,574 --> 0:35:51,534
So, how's things going with Finn?


541
0:35:51,534 --> 0:35:52,734
OK.


542
0:35:52,734 --> 0:35:54,553
Are you staying at his tonight?


543
0:35:54,553 --> 0:35:56,32
Yeah.


544
0:35:56,32 --> 0:35:57,792
But it's a long story.


545
0:35:57,792 --> 0:36:0,392
But you like him?
What, Finn?


546
0:36:0,392 --> 0:36:3,512
No! We're just best mates.


547
0:36:3,512 --> 0:36:6,273
I really want to kiss him,
but I don't know...


548
0:36:6,273 --> 0:36:8,672
I think he likes someone else.


549
0:36:8,672 --> 0:36:10,912
Who?


550
0:36:10,912 --> 0:36:12,632
I'm not too sure.


551
0:36:12,632 --> 0:36:14,73
Has he said anything to you?


552
0:36:14,73 --> 0:36:15,112
No.


553
0:36:15,112 --> 0:36:19,272
Maybe I won't try then.


554
0:36:19,272 --> 0:36:21,552
Whoo!


555
0:36:21,552 --> 0:36:29,872
Archie, come here.


556
0:36:29,872 --> 0:36:33,552
If you were a bloke,
I'd shag your lights out.


557
0:36:33,552 --> 0:36:36,832
Yeah. And if I was a bloke,
I'd let you.


558
0:36:36,832 --> 0:36:38,312
Really?


559
0:36:38,312 --> 0:36:40,912
I fucking love you, Rae.


560
0:36:40,912 --> 0:36:50,592
Promise me we'll hang out
next year at college, yeah?


561
0:36:50,592 --> 0:37:24,752
Whoo!


562
0:37:24,752 --> 0:37:28,552
I know you.
Everyone knows me.


563
0:37:28,552 --> 0:37:31,232
You've got the fuckin' moves, girl.


564
0:37:31,232 --> 0:37:33,592
I love it. I love to dance.


565
0:37:33,592 --> 0:37:35,32
I just love it.


566
0:37:35,32 --> 0:37:38,752
Right, come dance with me.


567
0:37:38,752 --> 0:37:47,752
Have you got anything?


568
0:37:47,752 --> 0:37:50,272
I'm single, are you?


569
0:37:50,272 --> 0:37:52,992
Are you here with someone?


570
0:37:52,992 --> 0:37:55,912
No. I'm not single.


571
0:37:55,912 --> 0:38:7,952
You can be single if you want.


572
0:38:7,952 --> 0:38:10,272
Rae, Rae, come here.
Come here.


573
0:38:10,272 --> 0:38:12,71
What are you doing?
I'm talking to her.


574
0:38:12,71 --> 0:38:14,873
I'll bring her back in a second.
I just need to borrow her a minute.


575
0:38:14,873 --> 0:38:25,552
Bye.


576
0:38:25,552 --> 0:38:28,633
What are you doing with knobheads?
What are doing with Kendo?


577
0:38:28,633 --> 0:38:30,152
Are you crying?


578
0:38:30,152 --> 0:38:32,552
- I fuckin' love her.
- Who?


579
0:38:32,552 --> 0:38:34,912
Izzy, I fuckin' love her.


580
0:38:34,912 --> 0:38:36,352
Whoa!


581
0:38:36,352 --> 0:38:37,911
Why are you telling me this?


582
0:38:37,911 --> 0:38:41,633
Because you're the daddy. You know
everything. Tell me what to do.


583
0:38:41,633 --> 0:38:43,592
Oh!


584
0:38:43,592 --> 0:38:44,912
Tell her.


585
0:38:44,912 --> 0:38:48,992
Just go over there and tell her
and be happy.


586
0:38:48,992 --> 0:38:51,432
Yeah?


587
0:38:51,432 --> 0:39:2,152
Yeah.


588
0:39:2,152 --> 0:39:5,672
Bloody hell!


589
0:39:5,672 --> 0:39:8,472
Come on.


590
0:39:8,472 --> 0:39:12,552
Chop!


591
0:39:12,552 --> 0:39:14,593
Hey, Barney, have you seen Chop?


592
0:39:14,593 --> 0:39:15,912
Huh!


593
0:39:15,912 --> 0:39:21,432
Er, Chop!


594
0:39:21,432 --> 0:39:22,872
Chop!


595
0:39:22,872 --> 0:39:25,672
Jesus, Rae, I'm so fucked.


596
0:39:25,672 --> 0:39:27,232
Yeah.


597
0:39:27,232 --> 0:39:28,912
Me too.


598
0:39:28,912 --> 0:39:30,352
Um...


599
0:39:30,352 --> 0:39:32,552
where the fuck is he?


600
0:39:32,552 --> 0:39:35,392
That boy's a constant flight risk.


601
0:39:35,392 --> 0:39:38,152
Right, just leave it.


602
0:39:38,152 --> 0:39:40,593
Right? He'll come back when he's
ready.


603
0:39:40,593 --> 0:39:43,552
And... I need another drink.


604
0:39:43,552 --> 0:39:45,552
So come on.
So come on.


605
0:39:45,552 --> 0:39:48,912
Come on, let's go.


606
0:39:48,912 --> 0:39:57,32
Why are you laughing?


607
0:39:57,32 --> 0:39:59,272
No way, I'll chunder.


608
0:39:59,272 --> 0:40:5,32
Pussy!


609
0:40:5,32 --> 0:40:6,992
Right...


610
0:40:6,992 --> 0:40:9,792
I need to kiss him tonight, babes.
Who?


611
0:40:9,792 --> 0:40:12,832
I need to kiss him.


612
0:40:12,832 --> 0:40:14,672
I need to tell him.


613
0:40:14,672 --> 0:40:16,351
What...
He needs to know!


614
0:40:16,351 --> 0:40:17,953
What are you on about?
You're fucked.


615
0:40:17,953 --> 0:40:19,592
No.


616
0:40:19,592 --> 0:40:21,112
I'm all right.


617
0:40:21,112 --> 0:40:23,513
I need to kiss him and I need to
tell him.


618
0:40:23,513 --> 0:40:27,432
He needs to know!


619
0:40:27,432 --> 0:40:28,832
Finn?


620
0:40:28,832 --> 0:40:32,672
Piss off!


621
0:40:32,672 --> 0:40:34,352
Finn?


622
0:40:34,352 --> 0:40:40,352
Finn!


623
0:40:40,352 --> 0:40:46,552
Finn?


624
0:40:46,552 --> 0:40:52,392
No...


625
0:40:52,392 --> 0:40:54,992
Rae, what are you going? Rae?
No!


626
0:40:54,992 --> 0:40:59,392
Rae!


627
0:40:59,392 --> 0:41:0,672
Rae!


628
0:41:0,672 --> 0:42:9,392
Rae!


629
0:42:9,392 --> 0:42:11,832
How you feeling?


630
0:42:11,832 --> 0:42:13,632
Like twice-boiled shit.


631
0:42:13,632 --> 0:42:20,112
Can you remember anything
from last night?


632
0:42:20,112 --> 0:42:22,152
A little.


633
0:42:22,152 --> 0:42:24,672
Oh, I can't remember a thing.


634
0:42:24,672 --> 0:42:28,272
Oh... You're stopping at Finn's,
right?


635
0:42:28,272 --> 0:42:30,592
No, just take me home.


636
0:42:30,592 --> 0:42:59,832
What about your mum?
Ohhh...


637
0:42:59,832 --> 0:43:1,593
What the fuck?!


638
0:43:1,593 --> 0:43:10,232
Karim?


639
0:43:10,232 --> 0:43:12,673
You sure you want to go home?


640
0:43:12,673 --> 0:43:51,432
Yeah.


641
0:43:51,432 --> 0:43:55,512
'Dear Diary,
if tea makes everything better,


642
0:43:55,512 --> 0:43:57,752
'I need an ocean of it.


643
0:43:57,752 --> 0:44:0,72
'I need all the tea in China.


644
0:44:0,72 --> 0:44:3,272
'Sorry I haven't written for a while
but...


645
0:44:3,272 --> 0:44:6,272
'well, what do you expect?


646
0:44:6,272 --> 0:44:8,112
'I'm unreliable.


647
0:44:8,112 --> 0:44:9,432
'I'm a mess.


648
0:44:9,432 --> 0:44:17,632
'I'm mental.'


649
0:44:17,632 --> 0:44:39,712
Hello, Mandela.


650
0:44:39,712 --> 0:44:40,712
Hello?


651
0:44:40,712 --> 0:44:42,992
'Rae? It's Kester.


652
0:44:42,992 --> 0:44:44,632
'Look, it's about Tix.'


653
0:44:44,632 --> 0:44:47,392
Oh, shit. The meal. I missed it.


654
0:44:47,392 --> 0:44:49,33
Is she there? Can I speak to her?


655
0:44:49,33 --> 0:44:51,192
'No, it's... it's not...


656
0:44:51,192 --> 0:44:54,392
'She...'
What?


657
0:44:54,392 --> 0:44:57,352
'She collapsed this morning.'


658
0:44:57,352 --> 0:44:58,992
Is it serious?


659
0:44:58,992 --> 0:46:58,992
'How quickly can you get to
the hospital?'
