0:0:6,804 --> 0:0:9,29
CHRISTINA TOSI: I moved to the
city to become a pastry chef.


3
0:0:9,29 --> 0:0:13,6
I just thought a real job
sounds boring to me.


4
0:0:13,6 --> 0:0:15,91
I really like to eat sweets
all the time.


5
0:0:15,91 --> 0:0:19,225
I'd rather do it all day, every
day than anything else.


6
0:0:19,225 --> 0:0:20,85
And so I'm just going to
jump in and do it.


7
0:0:20,85 --> 0:0:23,29
And I'll figure the
rest out later.

9
0:0:42,89 --> 0:0:44,86
CHRISTINA TOSI: We have a very
fun afternoon planned.


10
0:0:44,86 --> 0:0:48,82
We take having fun
very seriously.


11
0:0:48,82 --> 0:0:50,72
My name is Christina Tosi.


12
0:0:50,72 --> 0:0:55,26
I am the chef and owner
of Momofuku Milk Bar.


13
0:0:55,26 --> 0:0:57,34
We serve mostly sweet items.


14
0:0:57,34 --> 0:1:0,19
They're sort of kooky baked
goods with an American


15
0:1:0,19 --> 0:1:0,505
perspective.


16
0:1:0,505 --> 0:1:2,79
But we also have a lot
of savory breads.


17
0:1:2,79 --> 0:1:5,83
And we now have five stores
in New York City.


18
0:1:5,83 --> 0:1:8,63
We're most known for our cereal
milk, which is the


19
0:1:8,63 --> 0:1:11,9
flavor of what's left in your
bowl after you eat all of the


20
0:1:11,9 --> 0:1:12,27
cereal out of it.


21
0:1:12,27 --> 0:1:15,76
So the pretzel milk is the milk
that we're the most proud


22
0:1:15,76 --> 0:1:16,7
of right now.


23
0:1:16,7 --> 0:1:18,39
Most of the flavor of
the pretzels is


24
0:1:18,39 --> 0:1:20,175
actually on the outside.


25
0:1:20,175 --> 0:1:24,56
So you're sort of just washing
that salty layer off of them.


26
0:1:24,56 --> 0:1:27,28
For me, it's like the ultimate
salty, malty,


27
0:1:27,28 --> 0:1:31,4
sweet flavored milk.


28
0:1:31,4 --> 0:1:33,33
We've made ice cream
with it, like a


29
0:1:33,33 --> 0:1:34,42
pretzel-flavored ice cream.


30
0:1:34,42 --> 0:1:36,91
But when you have a really good
burger, it's not like


31
0:1:36,91 --> 0:1:38,35
it's the first burger
you've ever had.


32
0:1:38,35 --> 0:1:40,6
But you still want to talk
about it like it's a


33
0:1:40,6 --> 0:1:40,406
revelation.


34
0:1:40,406 --> 0:1:42,8
And that's what good food is.


35
0:1:42,8 --> 0:1:44,82
And then, of course, we have
pork buns, which are the


36
0:1:44,82 --> 0:1:46,4
Momofuku staple.


37
0:1:46,4 --> 0:1:48,52
If you know the name Momofuku,
you probably


38
0:1:48,52 --> 0:1:50,55
have had a pork bun.


39
0:1:50,55 --> 0:1:53,86
Long ago, when Dave Chang and
I were first coming up with


40
0:1:53,86 --> 0:1:56,65
the foundation of what Momofuku
Milk Bar would be, we


41
0:1:56,65 --> 0:2:0,21
said that it would be like Dairy
Queen with pork buns.


42
0:2:0,21 --> 0:2:3,83
We like to use our formal
foundations in cooking and in


43
0:2:3,83 --> 0:2:8,0
baking and sort of give it to
you as a customer in a really


44
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:11,48
easy, approachable way.


45
0:2:11,48 --> 0:2:13,36
You ladies ready?


46
0:2:13,36 --> 0:2:17,91
The foundations of Milk Bar come
from four of my favorite


47
0:2:17,91 --> 0:2:21,6
people in the whole wide world,
Courtney McBroom, Helen


48
0:2:21,6 --> 0:2:25,21
Jo, Jaime Dessecker,
and Jena Derman.


49
0:2:25,21 --> 0:2:26,56
They help run the kitchen.


50
0:2:26,56 --> 0:2:27,94
They help run the Milk Bars.


51
0:2:27,94 --> 0:2:31,42
They help do everything big
and small in between.


52
0:2:31,42 --> 0:2:34,41
They're sort of like
Wonder Women.


53
0:2:34,41 --> 0:2:36,18
Yeah.


54
0:2:36,18 --> 0:2:39,88
First we're going to go to Dairy
Queen for breakfast.


55
0:2:39,88 --> 0:2:44,12
On our way to Dairy Queen, we
started off with some jello


56
0:2:44,12 --> 0:2:48,24
shots that Jaime cast in these
orange rinds and then cut up


57
0:2:48,24 --> 0:2:50,58
like they were little orange
slices that you would eat


58
0:2:50,58 --> 0:2:52,986
after a crazy soccer match.


59
0:2:52,986 --> 0:2:54,93
Jaime, these are ridiculous.


60
0:2:54,93 --> 0:2:57,36
-Breakfast of champions.


61
0:2:57,36 --> 0:2:57,846
CHRISTINA TOSI: Cheers.


62
0:2:57,846 --> 0:2:59,96

63
0:2:59,96 --> 0:3:4,67



64
0:3:4,67 --> 0:3:5,55
CHRISTINA TOSI: And
we also made some


65
0:3:5,55 --> 0:3:7,52
kimchi Bloody Mary's.


66
0:3:7,52 --> 0:3:11,0
Being part of the Momofuku
family means having kimchi in


67
0:3:11,0 --> 0:3:12,46
house all the time.


68
0:3:12,46 --> 0:3:15,43
And for me, the kimchi Bloody
Mary was clutch on the way


69
0:3:15,43 --> 0:3:17,654
over to Dairy Queen.


70
0:3:17,654 --> 0:3:20,94

88
0:3:47,89 --> 0:3:50,444
Butterfinger, Heath,
and cookie dough?


89
0:3:50,444 --> 0:3:54,61



90
0:3:54,61 --> 0:3:57,53
I have a very strong opinion
about what goes into a


91
0:3:57,53 --> 0:4:0,7
Blizzard-- as many mix-ins
as possible.


92
0:4:0,7 --> 0:4:1,42
There must be Oreos.


93

all in one sitting.

COURTNEY MCBROOM: You got to
do fries in the Blizzard.


105

like eating ice cream


106
0:4:21,93 --> 0:4:22,79
when it's too cold.


107
0:4:22,79 --> 0:4:24,685
I like letting it melt
a little bit.


108
0:4:24,685 --> 0:4:26,505
And you got to go
salty French fry


109
0:4:26,505 --> 0:4:28,731
straight into your Blizzard.


110
0:4:28,731 --> 0:4:31,91
I'm also really into
the CheeseQuake.


111

Why didn't we come up with
the liquid CheeseQuake?


112
0:4:34,51 --> 0:4:37,85
I think Dairy Queen also has a
sense of humor in the way that


113
0:4:37,85 --> 0:4:41,61
they name some of their menu
items, which I really relate


114
0:4:41,61 --> 0:4:43,24
to for obvious reasons.


115
0:4:43,24 --> 0:4:45,975

scratch is like the ultimate--

I think-- experience, in terms
of what's my mood.

CHRISTINA TOSI: It maintains
that working hard and kicking


213
0:8:10,38 --> 0:8:12,43
butt and pushing yourself,
but also not taking


214
0:8:12,43 --> 0:8:13,842
yourself too seriously.

Hands down.

it's fairly obvious

who the winner is.

Clearly ours is the tallest.

You know, it's fun to
be competitive.


224
0:8:33,309 --> 0:8:35,34
It's fun to be like who's going
to scoop cookies the

we to decided to head


228
0:8:43,57 --> 0:8:46,21
to Randall's Island Golf Center
for a little game of


229
0:8:46,21 --> 0:8:47,24
putt-putt golf.


230
0:8:47,24 --> 0:8:49,38
All right.

235
0:8:55,54 --> 0:8:59,1
Duck pin bowling and putt-putt
golf were the foundations of


236
0:8:59,1 --> 0:9:0,46
my childhood.


237
0:9:0,46 --> 0:9:5,26
So whenever I see a putt-putt
golf course, I can't stop


238
0:9:5,26 --> 0:9:9,0
talking about it until I get out
of the car and can hit the


239
0:9:9,0 --> 0:9:11,455
putt-putt golf course.


240
0:9:11,455 --> 0:9:13,28
Dave Chang met us there.


241
0:9:13,28 --> 0:9:16,82
Most people don't know that when
he was a kid, he was sort


242
0:9:16,82 --> 0:9:21,55
of on the road to becoming a
professional golf player.


243
0:9:21,55 --> 0:9:24,24
He was one-handing some
putt-putt holes, which I


244
0:9:24,24 --> 0:9:26,88
thought was pretty intense.


245
0:9:26,88 --> 0:9:29,636
Where'd you get those hot
putt-putt golf kicks?


246
0:9:29,636 --> 0:9:31,425
Just a little something
you picked up?

0:9:31,425 --> 0:9:37,126

0:9:37,126 --> 0:9:37,61
COURTNEY MCBROOM: Yeah.


249
0:9:37,61 --> 0:9:39,14
CHRISTINA TOSI: Courtney got
the first hole-in-one.


250
0:9:39,14 --> 0:9:40,96
We had a little friendly
wager.


251
0:9:40,96 --> 0:9:42,65
I owe her $20, I think.


252
0:9:42,65 --> 0:9:44,68
Damn it.


253
0:9:44,68 --> 0:9:48,45
COURTNEY MCBROOM: You can put me
down for one on this hole.


254
0:9:48,45 --> 0:9:50,3
CHRISTINA TOSI: Some more
friends started arriving.


255
0:9:50,3 --> 0:9:54,26
Danny from Mission Chinese and
Steve from Asia Dog ended up


256
0:9:54,26 --> 0:9:57,84
joining us at Randall's Island
with the hot new Taco Bell


257

cheese taco shell.


258
0:10:1,11 --> 0:10:3,72
DANNY BOWIEN: We went and we
got 40 of the Dorito tacos.


259
0:10:3,72 --> 0:10:4,17
CHRISTINA TOSI: Why
did you do that?


260
0:10:4,17 --> 0:10:5,33
We have too many.


261
0:10:5,33 --> 0:10:5,921
DANNY BOWIEN: Because
you have to try it.


262
0:10:5,921 --> 0:10:7,394
Because we were talking
about it yesterday.


263

one now, or what?

JENA DERMAN: This
is ridiculous.

mixed for years.

on putt-putt and just start

tailgating.

0:10:30,97 --> 0:10:31,958

to like, let's get

0:10:49,14 --> 0:10:51,936
You want these in here?

COURTNEY MCBROOM: We're going
to take care of you later.


289
0:10:54,57 --> 0:10:56,69
CHRISTINA TOSI: For a proper
tailgate, I feel like there


290
0:10:56,69 --> 0:10:58,73
has to be some sort
of chips and dip.


291
0:10:58,73 --> 0:11:0,45
We're very big on chips and
dip in our kitchens.


292
0:11:0,45 --> 0:11:3,83
So we brought ranch dip and
potato chips and we made a


293
0:11:3,83 --> 0:11:5,906
sick seven layer dip with
tortilla chips.


294
0:11:5,906 --> 0:11:8,84



295
0:11:8,84 --> 0:11:13,15
For me, a good tailgate
has warm food.


296
0:11:13,15 --> 0:11:14,92
So these are kimchi
quesadillas.


297
0:11:14,92 --> 0:11:17,845
They're tortillas with a little
bit of shredded cheddar


298
0:11:17,845 --> 0:11:21,642
cheese and our home-made
kimchi, Napa cabbage.


299
0:11:21,642 --> 0:11:22,892

bring our favorite throw


302
0:11:28,0 --> 0:11:30,61
together sandwich, which is
a grilled cheese sandwich.


303
0:11:30,61 --> 0:11:32,14
But instead of sandwich
bread, we use


304
0:11:32,14 --> 0:11:33,7
two of our corn cookies.


305
0:11:33,7 --> 0:11:36,615
And we make a ham and cheese
grilled cheese sandwich.

307

tailgate it's because I was


308
0:11:42,3 --> 0:11:43,9
going to a Redskins game.


309
0:11:43,9 --> 0:11:47,27

up to the stadium at 7:45

in the morning.


311
0:11:47,775 --> 0:11:50,68
And we got so shit-faced
my sister was trying to


312
0:11:50,68 --> 0:11:53,21
roundhouse kick me.


313
0:11:53,21 --> 0:11:55,23
Shit-faced at 10 o'clock
in the morning.


314
0:11:55,23 --> 0:11:57,59
And then she got mad at me
because she fell on the ground


315
0:11:57,59 --> 0:11:58,726
and couldn't beat me up.

0:12:0,154 --> 0:12:2,54
That was the last time I
tailgated, the one and only


318
0:12:2,54 --> 0:12:4,13
time that I think I properly
tailgated.

0:12:9,97 --> 0:12:11,7
kumbaya-ing around the tailgate.


323
0:12:11,7 --> 0:12:15,56
And all of a sudden, this woman
at the Randall's Island


324
0:12:15,56 --> 0:12:18,24
Golf Center called the cops
on us because apparently,


325
0:12:18,24 --> 0:12:21,48
tailgating is not legal
in their parking lot.


326
0:12:21,48 --> 0:12:22,72
They weren't having
us anymore.


327
0:12:22,72 --> 0:12:25,62
So we packed up and
got out of there.

0:12:25,62 --> 0:12:26,203
