0:0:7,727 --> 0:0:14,86
ALICE ROBERTS: They say this is where it all began.


2
0:0:14,86 --> 0:0:20,687
That we are all children of Africa.


3
0:0:20,687 --> 0:0:26,327
But if so, why do we look so different?


4
0:0:26,327 --> 0:0:29,966
And how on earth could a handful of African families


5
0:0:29,966 --> 0:0:45,246
become a whole world full of people?


6
0:0:45,246 --> 0:0:50,6
I'm Alice Roberts, medical doctor and anthropologist.


7
0:0:50,6 --> 0:0:55,326
I'm fascinated by what bones, stones


8
0:0:55,326 --> 0:1:1,567
and even our bodies can reveal about the distant past.


9
0:1:1,567 --> 0:1:6,126
I'm going in search of the traces left by our African ancestors


10
0:1:6,126 --> 0:1:12,486
and their journeys to populate the world.


11
0:1:12,486 --> 0:1:18,406
This time, the Americas, seemingly impossible to reach.


12
0:1:18,406 --> 0:1:20,486
Ow!


13
0:1:20,486 --> 0:1:26,46
In one direction, a vast wall of ice.


14
0:1:26,46 --> 0:1:31,527
In the other, thousands of miles of empty ocean.


15
0:1:31,527 --> 0:1:33,966
It just doesn't seem to stack up.


16
0:1:33,966 --> 0:1:37,887
That makes us rethink all of our theories about early Americans.


17
0:1:37,887 --> 0:1:42,447
So how did people reach the Americas?


18
0:1:42,447 --> 0:1:45,606
Come with me in the footsteps of our ancestors


19
0:1:45,606 --> 0:2:18,7
on the most epic adventure ever undertaken.


20
0:2:18,7 --> 0:2:21,167
With a modern population of almost a billion,


21
0:2:21,167 --> 0:2:24,526
it's easy to forget that until quite recently


22
0:2:24,526 --> 0:2:36,646
not a single person lived in the Americas.


23
0:2:36,646 --> 0:2:41,127
For our ancient ancestors, there were two very good reasons for this.


24
0:2:41,127 --> 0:2:44,887
To the south, the vast, uncrossable Pacific Ocean,


25
0:2:44,887 --> 0:2:51,687
and to the north, ice.


26
0:2:51,687 --> 0:2:53,926
At the peak of the last Ice Age


27
0:2:53,926 --> 0:2:58,567
much of North America was swathed in a massive blanket of ice


28
0:2:58,567 --> 0:3:4,486
up to 3 kilometres deep.


29
0:3:4,486 --> 0:3:7,526
I've come to the Ipsuit Glacier in Canada,


30
0:3:7,526 --> 0:3:10,447
a remnant of those ancient ice sheets,


31
0:3:10,447 --> 0:3:15,247
to try to understand the challenge facing our ancestors.


32
0:3:15,247 --> 0:3:18,806
JIM: Just do everything very gently.


33
0:3:18,806 --> 0:3:21,167
ROBERTS: My guide is Jim Orava.


34
0:3:21,167 --> 0:3:24,407
He's climbed some of the world's most formidable peaks.


35
0:3:24,407 --> 0:3:26,646
This is making me somewhat nervous.


36
0:3:26,646 --> 0:3:29,766
Jim is going up a vertical wall of ice


37
0:3:29,766 --> 0:3:33,766
with a couple of ice axes and crampons.


38
0:3:33,766 --> 0:3:36,206
Okay, we're just about to bring you up now, Alice.


39
0:3:36,206 --> 0:3:41,127
Jim's just put an ice screw in up there and he's belaying me with this rope.


40
0:3:41,127 --> 0:3:43,727
So if I do fall, I shouldn't fall too far.


41
0:3:43,727 --> 0:3:48,766
Okay, climbing.


42
0:3:48,766 --> 0:3:50,366
(GROANS)


43
0:3:50,366 --> 0:3:54,167
Ice can be treacherous and deceptive.


44
0:3:54,167 --> 0:3:56,407
I can hear the ice creaking.


45
0:3:56,407 --> 0:4:0,727
It's hard to tell what's solid.


46
0:4:0,727 --> 0:4:2,46
JIM: You're doing very well.


47
0:4:2,46 --> 0:4:6,326
My heart is in my mouth.


48
0:4:6,326 --> 0:4:8,526
JIM: It's steep.


49
0:4:8,526 --> 0:4:18,966
-You got me there, Jim? -I've got you, yeah.


50
0:4:18,966 --> 0:4:20,447
This really is nerve-wracking.


51
0:4:20,447 --> 0:4:25,887
I am standing on the very edge of this precipice-like crevasse.


52
0:4:25,887 --> 0:4:31,47
And I've got to walk up this knife edge. I cannot rely on the snow this side.


53
0:4:31,47 --> 0:4:39,447
I don't wanna be at the bottom of that crevasse.


54
0:4:39,447 --> 0:4:47,526
JIM: Don't stand on the snow, 'cause that could be a trapdoor.


55
0:4:47,526 --> 0:4:49,86
-Okay. -Well done. Tricky bit.


56
0:4:49,86 --> 0:4:51,206
Oh, thank you.


57
0:4:51,206 --> 0:4:59,406
Even with crampons, ice picks and Jim's help, it's been a challenge.


58
0:4:59,406 --> 0:5:6,247
So imagine Stone Age families on a 5,000-kilometre trek across ice


59
0:5:6,247 --> 0:5:13,846
with no guide, no safety gear, and only as much food as they can carry.


60
0:5:13,846 --> 0:5:24,567
Surely every bit as impossible as crossing the oceans.


61
0:5:24,567 --> 0:5:28,487
And that's what's so puzzling about the peopling of the Americas.


62
0:5:28,487 --> 0:5:33,687
Because this was a land that was, to all intents and purposes, unreachable.


63
0:5:33,687 --> 0:5:38,646
And yet we know that people got here.


64
0:5:38,646 --> 0:5:43,326
So just how did our ancestors do it?


65
0:5:43,326 --> 0:5:49,86
My investigation starts in Calgary.


66
0:5:49,86 --> 0:5:50,887
(DRUMS BEATING)


67
0:5:50,887 --> 0:5:54,927
(SINGING)


68
0:5:54,927 --> 0:6:3,367
Every summer, descendants of the first Americans gather together.


69
0:6:3,367 --> 0:6:7,646
I've come to the annual powwow of the Tsuu T'ina Nation.


70
0:6:7,646 --> 0:6:14,127
For them, it's a chance to celebrate their roots.


71
0:6:14,127 --> 0:6:16,127
What a beautiful dress.


72
0:6:16,127 --> 0:6:21,646
And for me, it's a chance to search for some hint of their past.


73
0:6:21,646 --> 0:6:23,447
(SINGING)


74
0:6:23,447 --> 0:6:25,406
ROBERTS: Are those leaders from lots of different tribes?


75
0:6:25,406 --> 0:6:26,607
No, from this tribe.


76
0:6:26,607 --> 0:6:28,406
-From the Tsuu T'ina? -The leaders of this land.


77
0:6:28,406 --> 0:6:32,406
-Right. -Yeah, from the Tsuu T'ina.


78
0:6:32,406 --> 0:6:37,966
Recent scientific discoveries suggest that around 70,000 years ago


79
0:6:37,966 --> 0:6:45,206
a tiny group of us left Africa and went on to populate the rest of the world.


80
0:6:45,206 --> 0:6:47,687
But how we reached the Americas,


81
0:6:47,687 --> 0:6:55,966
whether from the north or across the oceans, is a mystery.


82
0:6:55,966 --> 0:7:6,526
Does Tsuu T'ina folklore say anything about how their ancestors got here?


83
0:7:6,526 --> 0:7:9,206
Chief, I'm very interested in


84
0:7:9,206 --> 0:7:13,687
how the Tsuu T'ina came to be in this place.


85
0:7:13,687 --> 0:7:19,206
Well, what was told to us by our ancestors, the old people,


86
0:7:19,206 --> 0:7:24,487
was that thousands of years ago we were travelling, migrating across the ice


87
0:7:24,487 --> 0:7:27,47
over a disagreement in a huge camp.


88
0:7:27,47 --> 0:7:28,367
So they were going across ice?


89
0:7:28,367 --> 0:7:31,286
They were going across the ice at Slave Lake.


90
0:7:31,286 --> 0:7:34,966
And there was a young child that was on her grandmother's back.


91
0:7:34,966 --> 0:7:38,286
And there was a horn sticking out of the ice.


92
0:7:38,286 --> 0:7:42,646
So the child was asking for that horn, so they had to stop the migration.


93
0:7:42,646 --> 0:7:47,47
So they started to chip away at that ice to get that horn out


94
0:7:47,47 --> 0:7:49,526
and then it cracked and split in two.


95
0:7:49,526 --> 0:7:55,326
So the clans that were already on the south side continued to migrate south,


96
0:7:55,326 --> 0:7:58,47
and the ones in the north stayed up in the north.


97
0:7:58,47 --> 0:8:0,607
That's what we've been told through history.


98
0:8:0,607 --> 0:8:5,247
That's fascinating.


99
0:8:5,247 --> 0:8:9,726
It's really intriguing that this story of the first Tsuu T'ina


100
0:8:9,726 --> 0:8:14,367
hints at a journey across the ice.


101
0:8:14,367 --> 0:8:23,127
But it's how these people look that might be a more important clue.


102
0:8:23,127 --> 0:8:28,766
I visited a tribe in Siberia and I think that there are some similarities


103
0:8:28,766 --> 0:8:31,487
between your people and those people in Siberia.


104
0:8:31,487 --> 0:8:33,86
And it might just be quite interesting


105
0:8:33,86 --> 0:8:36,206
to look at these pictures of Evenki faces.


106
0:8:36,206 --> 0:8:40,527
So there's an old lady...


107
0:8:40,527 --> 0:8:43,326
And a mum and a child.


108
0:8:43,326 --> 0:8:44,886
Do you think these faces look similar?


109
0:8:44,886 --> 0:8:48,606
The eyes are similar to the real far-northern Dene


110
0:8:48,606 --> 0:8:50,287
up in the Yukon and that.


111
0:8:50,287 --> 0:8:51,567
-Yeah. -very similar.


112
0:8:51,567 --> 0:8:53,807
-These almond-shaped eyes. -Yes.


113
0:8:53,807 --> 0:8:55,407
And high, wide cheekbones.


114
0:8:55,407 --> 0:8:57,687
very wide cheekbones, yeah.


115
0:8:57,687 --> 0:8:59,47
CHIEF: Prominent noses.


116
0:8:59,47 --> 0:9:2,246
Yeah.


117
0:9:2,246 --> 0:9:5,366
And it's not just facial similarities.


118
0:9:5,366 --> 0:9:12,647
This teepee is almost identical to the tchum of the Siberian Evenki.


119
0:9:12,647 --> 0:9:14,567
Could this be more evidence


120
0:9:14,567 --> 0:9:18,647
that the first American families came from Siberia?


121
0:9:18,647 --> 0:9:22,6
Or is it just coincidence?


122
0:9:22,6 --> 0:9:25,606
If the ancestors of the Tsuu T'ina did come from the north,


123
0:9:25,606 --> 0:9:29,86
they could have made it as far as Alaska.


124
0:9:29,86 --> 0:9:31,567
Because instead of the Bering Straits,


125
0:9:31,567 --> 0:9:42,886
20,000 years ago there was a vast swath of land, Beringia.


126
0:9:42,886 --> 0:9:47,6
But a huge eXpanse of ice still blocks the way


127
0:9:47,6 --> 0:10:2,287
to the rest of the Americas.


128
0:10:2,287 --> 0:10:13,366
It's time to look at those ice sheets in more detail.


129
0:10:13,366 --> 0:10:16,647
Well, climate scientists can now do something rather wonderful.


130
0:10:16,647 --> 0:10:22,687
They can let us peer back in time and give us an ancient weather report.


131
0:10:22,687 --> 0:10:25,126
I'm looking here at a map of North America


132
0:10:25,126 --> 0:10:28,206
as it was 22,000 years ago.


133
0:10:28,206 --> 0:10:31,6
So actually before the peak of the last Ice Age.


134
0:10:31,6 --> 0:10:36,407
And you can see this massive sheet of ice right across the top here.


135
0:10:36,407 --> 0:10:40,927
Well, I'm gonna run this through time...


136
0:10:40,927 --> 0:10:44,527
and we'll see what happens to that ice sheet.


137
0:10:44,527 --> 0:10:47,167
It's moving at the edges.


138
0:10:47,167 --> 0:10:49,126
And in fact it's splitting in two.


139
0:10:49,126 --> 0:10:55,807
It parts into two separate ice sheets and a corridor appears.


140
0:10:55,807 --> 0:11:4,86
So there was a way down at about 1 3,500 years ago.


141
0:11:4,86 --> 0:11:15,567
Was this corridor the gateway to the Americas?


142
0:11:15,567 --> 0:11:17,126
Hello. Are you Bert?


143
0:11:17,126 --> 0:11:28,86
BERT: I'm Bert.


144
0:11:28,86 --> 0:11:32,527
If a few adventurous hunters did come through the corridor in the ice,


145
0:11:32,527 --> 0:11:35,447
we can be sure of one thing -


146
0:11:35,447 --> 0:11:38,687
it wouldn't have been easy.


147
0:11:38,687 --> 0:11:41,647
Even today, it feels as though the Ice Age


148
0:11:41,647 --> 0:11:45,246
still has a grip on these mountains.


149
0:11:45,246 --> 0:11:47,447
Trucker Bert Van de Wetering


150
0:11:47,447 --> 0:11:54,726
knows how treacherous this northern landscape can suddenly become.


151
0:11:54,726 --> 0:11:57,206
ROBERTS: So it's the middle of summer and you've still got snow.


152
0:11:57,206 --> 0:12:1,486
That's correct. The area that we're gonna get into here in a little bit


153
0:12:1,486 --> 0:12:4,527
has all these chutes coming down, so there are slides,


154
0:12:4,527 --> 0:12:8,726
and the highway is closed a lot of the time because of these avalanches.


155
0:12:8,726 --> 0:12:12,966
I presume it gets quite icy and slippery in the depths of winter.


156
0:12:12,966 --> 0:12:15,567
BERT: It can get very crazy here.


157
0:12:15,567 --> 0:12:18,807
You can get freezing rain, you can get real cold temperatures.


158
0:12:18,807 --> 0:12:20,767
Sometimes we see a lot of snow.


159
0:12:20,767 --> 0:12:23,447
Yeah. How cold does it get?


160
0:12:23,447 --> 0:12:27,606
We get minus 20. I think it's been colder in the past,


161
0:12:27,606 --> 0:12:29,47
but we're still getting minus 20.


162
0:12:29,47 --> 0:12:30,126
That's cold enough.


163
0:12:30,126 --> 0:12:34,206
Oh, yeah.


164
0:12:34,206 --> 0:12:44,407
But that's nothing compared with the ice-free corridor 1 3,500 years ago.


165
0:12:44,407 --> 0:12:47,6
Any families coming through that corridor


166
0:12:47,6 --> 0:12:51,567
would surely have faced a hellish journey,


167
0:12:51,567 --> 0:12:53,846
huddled against the howling wind


168
0:12:53,846 --> 0:13:7,767
in a land of torrential rivers and floating ice.


169
0:13:7,767 --> 0:13:10,167
So did anyone try?


170
0:13:10,167 --> 0:13:15,366
And if so, did they make it?


171
0:13:15,366 --> 0:13:25,486
The answers to all these questions lie in that direction.


172
0:13:25,486 --> 0:13:28,86
Because right across North America


173
0:13:28,86 --> 0:13:35,767
archaeologists have been finding thousands of objects like this.


174
0:13:35,767 --> 0:13:45,167
They're called Clovis points.


175
0:13:45,167 --> 0:13:48,567
And they date from just a few hundred years


176
0:13:48,567 --> 0:13:54,647
after the corridor in the ice appeared.


177
0:13:54,647 --> 0:14:0,927
So this could have been the way in.


178
0:14:0,927 --> 0:14:3,167
But what kind of a world


179
0:14:3,167 --> 0:14:18,527
would these pioneers find on the other side of the ice?


180
0:14:18,527 --> 0:14:21,807
The tools themselves are important clues.


181
0:14:21,807 --> 0:14:26,366
And to find out how, I'm meeting archaeologist Andy Hemmings.


182
0:14:26,366 --> 0:14:30,807
So these are these really classic stone Clovis spear points.


183
0:14:30,807 --> 0:14:33,527
Yeah. It's important to understand about Clovis, though,


184
0:14:33,527 --> 0:14:35,47
that they aren't just stone points,


185
0:14:35,47 --> 0:14:39,447
they also made some very lethal and effective bone and ivory points as well.


186
0:14:39,447 --> 0:14:44,47
These are state-of-the-art, lethal killing machines from 1 3,000 years ago.


187
0:14:44,47 --> 0:14:47,126
And what sort of animals do you think they would have hunted with them?


188
0:14:47,126 --> 0:14:50,6
The most common that we've found them directly associated with


189
0:14:50,6 --> 0:14:54,407
are mammoths, bison and mastodon, in that order.


190
0:14:54,407 --> 0:14:56,726
But at clovis sites across the New World,


191
0:14:56,726 --> 0:15:0,606
we've found more than 1 25 species of plants and animals.


192
0:15:0,606 --> 0:15:2,126
So they're general hunters,


193
0:15:2,126 --> 0:15:5,167
but you really think they were hunting mammoth?


194
0:15:5,167 --> 0:15:6,567
Oh, absolutely.


195
0:15:6,567 --> 0:15:9,527
The best example probably is a site in southeast Arizona,


196
0:15:9,527 --> 0:15:12,807
where eight Clovis points were found with one mammoth body.


197
0:15:12,807 --> 0:15:14,966
Five of them were found behind the back of the head


198
0:15:14,966 --> 0:15:16,407
and in front of the shoulder blades,


199
0:15:16,407 --> 0:15:20,167
any one of which probably would have been about a lethal wound.


200
0:15:20,167 --> 0:15:27,966
Andy shows me how he thinks they did it.


201
0:15:27,966 --> 0:15:31,126
Andy, that doesn't look much like a mammoth to me.


202
0:15:31,126 --> 0:15:34,167
There's no animal in the Pleistocene that had a hide that tough.


203
0:15:34,167 --> 0:15:37,726
And if we can poke a hole in that... If you can poke a hole in that,


204
0:15:37,726 --> 0:15:40,246
we could've eaten anything. Just like the Clovis people did.


205
0:15:40,246 --> 0:15:42,167
Right. So I've got my spear thrower.


206
0:15:42,167 --> 0:15:47,6
ANDY: Let's see what you can do.


207
0:15:47,6 --> 0:15:48,886
A glancing blow, you've slowed him.


208
0:15:48,886 --> 0:15:54,846
-Got his feet. -Try again.


209
0:15:54,846 --> 0:15:56,846
Scratched it.


210
0:15:56,846 --> 0:15:58,606
Do you wanna show me how it's done, Andy?


211
0:15:58,606 --> 0:16:1,846
I'll give it a try.


212
0:16:1,846 --> 0:16:6,47
ROBERTS: Oh, my God!


213
0:16:6,47 --> 0:16:9,167
Well, that's made a hell of a dent in this metal door.


214
0:16:9,167 --> 0:16:12,527
I hit it pretty cleanly, and you can see I just destroyed the end of my spear.


215
0:16:12,527 --> 0:16:14,807
It would have stuck in the hide of a mammoth or a mastodon.


216
0:16:14,807 --> 0:16:18,366
Yeah.


217
0:16:18,366 --> 0:16:21,767
The mammoth and mastodon, two of the mighty animals


218
0:16:21,767 --> 0:16:28,886
roaming this vast landscape.


219
0:16:28,886 --> 0:16:39,6
But little match for people with a weapon as deadly as the Clovis point.


220
0:16:39,6 --> 0:16:42,486
Some think that these pioneers of the new frontier


221
0:16:42,486 --> 0:16:45,47
plunged into an orgy of slaughter,


222
0:16:45,47 --> 0:16:51,47
wiping out Ice Age animals like the mammoth.


223
0:16:51,47 --> 0:16:53,606
The evidence is questionable.


224
0:16:53,606 --> 0:17:7,807
But that image of the mighty hunter has stuck.


225
0:17:7,807 --> 0:17:11,567
(BARKING)


226
0:17:11,567 --> 0:17:15,646
So it looks as if small groups of men, women and children


227
0:17:15,646 --> 0:17:22,366
made that first push into America about 1 3,500 years ago.


228
0:17:22,366 --> 0:17:27,247
Using their sophisticated tools, they made the most of their new home


229
0:17:27,247 --> 0:17:35,247
and spread right across the continent from coast to coast.


230
0:17:35,247 --> 0:17:38,287
Until recently, this was the version of American prehistory


231
0:17:38,287 --> 0:17:40,406
that most experts agreed on.


232
0:17:40,406 --> 0:17:42,886
But a new discovery here in Texas


233
0:17:42,886 --> 0:17:57,846
is threatening to rewrite the entire story.


234
0:17:57,846 --> 0:18:8,366
Archaeologist Mike Collins is a very patient man.


235
0:18:8,366 --> 0:18:15,727
For 1 5 years, he's been digging away in this small field near Austin.


236
0:18:15,727 --> 0:18:20,686
And he's found something that no one eXpected.


237
0:18:20,686 --> 0:18:23,487
So, Mike, what sort of dates have you got coming out of here?


238
0:18:23,487 --> 0:18:27,886
We have the entire prehistory of central Texas represented at this site.


239
0:18:27,886 --> 0:18:32,487
The kinds of artefacts we find and the few absolute dates that we have


240
0:18:32,487 --> 0:18:35,767
tell us that people were here from 500 years ago,


241
0:18:35,767 --> 0:18:39,767
back 1 3,500 years ago.


242
0:18:39,767 --> 0:18:43,446
Even more importantly, we have stuff below that.


243
0:18:43,446 --> 0:18:45,7
Below Clovis, so older than Clovis?


244
0:18:45,7 --> 0:18:47,86
Older than Clovis. Pre-Clovis.


245
0:18:47,86 --> 0:18:50,446
-Right. -Right here at this site.


246
0:18:50,446 --> 0:18:52,287
But for years archaeologists have thought


247
0:18:52,287 --> 0:18:54,967
that Clovis was the first culture in the Americas.


248
0:18:54,967 --> 0:18:56,767
Yeah, most archaeologists have thought that,


249
0:18:56,767 --> 0:18:59,47
but there's a few of us that have known better.


250
0:18:59,47 --> 0:19:2,567
And over on the other side of the site, you can see the Clovis level


251
0:19:2,567 --> 0:19:4,446
and you can see artefacts below it.


252
0:19:4,446 --> 0:19:6,7
-You want to see that? -I'd love to see it.


253
0:19:6,7 --> 0:19:16,606
Let's go see it.


254
0:19:16,606 --> 0:19:18,807
Mike, this is an incredibly deep test pit.


255
0:19:18,807 --> 0:19:20,366
Yes, it's a deep test pit


256
0:19:20,366 --> 0:19:23,166
and we're really interested in this part of it, right here.


257
0:19:23,166 --> 0:19:25,926
Because right through here we get Clovis artefacts,


258
0:19:25,926 --> 0:19:29,166
but as we dug down we continued to get artefacts below that


259
0:19:29,166 --> 0:19:33,86
for about 20 or 25 centimetres more.


260
0:19:33,86 --> 0:19:36,86
A nice flake here, for example, with a platform


261
0:19:36,86 --> 0:19:39,366
and good flake scars on it.


262
0:19:39,366 --> 0:19:43,287
We have one date from down here of 1 4,400 years.


263
0:19:43,287 --> 0:19:44,807
1 4,400?


264
0:19:44,807 --> 0:19:46,7
Yeah.


265
0:19:46,7 --> 0:19:47,646
So that's pre-Clovis.


266
0:19:47,646 --> 0:19:49,646
By a thousand years.


267
0:19:49,646 --> 0:19:53,287
I mean, that's amazing, because that makes us rethink


268
0:19:53,287 --> 0:19:55,967
all of our theories about early Americans.


269
0:19:55,967 --> 0:19:58,767
Yes, we have to rethink our paradigm.


270
0:19:58,767 --> 0:20:2,967
We have to come up with a new accounting of the peopling of the Americas.


271
0:20:2,967 --> 0:20:6,886
Mike, how sure are you about the date of these artefacts?


272
0:20:6,886 --> 0:20:8,406
It's just one date,


273
0:20:8,406 --> 0:20:11,326
so you need to corroborate it with further evidence.


274
0:20:11,326 --> 0:20:26,846
And that's what we're working on.


275
0:20:26,846 --> 0:20:29,886
Now, we can only draw tentative conclusions


276
0:20:29,886 --> 0:20:32,446
from the evidence emerging here,


277
0:20:32,446 --> 0:20:37,47
but our grand theory about how humans first got into North America


278
0:20:37,47 --> 0:20:39,926
is starting to look decidedly dodgy.


279
0:20:39,926 --> 0:20:42,7
Because if there really were


280
0:20:42,7 --> 0:20:45,366
people living here at Gault as early as Mike says there were,


281
0:20:45,366 --> 0:20:49,326
then there must have been another route into the Americas,


282
0:20:49,326 --> 0:20:52,606
because the ice-free corridor wasn't open yet.


283
0:20:52,606 --> 0:20:54,727
But what I need is more proof.


284
0:20:54,727 --> 0:20:58,686
And if the claims coming out of South America are to believed,


285
0:20:58,686 --> 0:21:3,47
then they may have even earlier and more compelling evidence


286
0:21:3,47 --> 0:21:8,567
than I've seen here in Texas.


287
0:21:8,567 --> 0:21:12,446
It's time to leave North America for the South.


288
0:21:12,446 --> 0:21:17,527
Ahead of me is a three-day journey, but one I hope will be worth it.


289
0:21:17,527 --> 0:21:22,487
Because what I'm off to see could change everything.


290
0:21:22,487 --> 0:21:26,686
My destination is Santarem in Brazil.


291
0:21:26,686 --> 0:21:52,646
And it's got a rather eXcellent prehistoric transport link - the Amazon.


292
0:21:52,646 --> 0:21:55,207
I'm about to embark on a seven-hour river journey


293
0:21:55,207 --> 0:21:59,366
to reach a very special place, the home of some of the earliest South Americans.


294
0:21:59,366 --> 0:22:12,406
And unless I want to be standing the whole way, I'd better get a move-on.


295
0:22:12,406 --> 0:22:18,366
I think this is going to be quite comfortable.


296
0:22:18,366 --> 0:22:24,727
Looking around at my fellow passengers, I have a sense of deja vu.


297
0:22:24,727 --> 0:22:28,646
I'm sure I can see those same East Asian features


298
0:22:28,646 --> 0:22:32,487
that I saw in the north.


299
0:22:32,487 --> 0:22:35,807
Could it be that these are still echoes


300
0:22:35,807 --> 0:22:59,487
of an ancient Siberian ancestry?


301
0:22:59,487 --> 0:23:3,686
Impromptu fireworks finally announce our arrival


302
0:23:3,686 --> 0:23:6,926
at the tiny port of Monte Alegre.


303
0:23:6,926 --> 0:23:10,487
Well, we're just coming into port, so my journey's almost over for today.


304
0:23:10,487 --> 0:23:17,7
But I've still got quite a long way to go tomorrow.


305

311
0:23:48,166 --> 0:23:52,527

313
0:23:54,406 --> 0:24:0,646
Ow!


314
0:24:0,646 --> 0:24:2,767
We're just going to clear some foliage out of the way


315
0:24:2,767 --> 0:24:4,967
before we can go any further.


316
0:24:4,967 --> 0:24:8,686
I can see why it isn't a major tourist attraction.


317
0:24:8,686 --> 0:24:19,166

318
0:24:19,166 --> 0:24:32,967
Ooh, it's hot now.

(BATS SQUEAKING)


320
0:24:35,406 --> 0:24:38,326
We really have to proceed with caution here,


321
0:24:38,326 --> 0:24:40,86
because there are bats, I can hear them.


322
0:24:40,86 --> 0:24:44,166
So a risk of rabies, and there are poisonous wasps as well


323
0:24:44,166 --> 0:24:45,807
that have made their nests all over this cave.


324
0:24:45,807 --> 0:24:52,807
So we don't want to disturb them.


325
0:24:52,807 --> 0:24:57,446
Oh, look, look. Bats.


326
0:24:57,446 --> 0:24:59,406

0:25:1,727 --> 0:25:5,7
-Honestly? -Yes.


330
0:25:5,7 --> 0:25:10,807
Right. Even more cautious, then.


331
0:25:10,807 --> 0:25:13,166
When these caves were eXcavated,


332
0:25:13,166 --> 0:25:17,487
it became clear that they had been home to ancient people.


333
0:25:17,487 --> 0:25:26,567
Archaeologists found animal bones, shells and some eXquisite stone tools.


334
0:25:26,567 --> 0:25:29,567
Well, this is a replica of some of the points


335
0:25:29,567 --> 0:25:31,567
that have been found in these caves.


336
0:25:31,567 --> 0:25:36,527
And it's very beautiful. Perhaps an arrowhead or a harpoon point.


337
0:25:36,527 --> 0:25:39,247
very finely worked, and you can see the stem here,


338
0:25:39,247 --> 0:25:42,7
where it's designed to be attached to a shaft.


339
0:25:42,7 --> 0:25:45,846
And it's also very different from those characteristic points


340
0:25:45,846 --> 0:25:48,247
that we saw in North America.


341
0:25:48,247 --> 0:25:51,326
And, in fact, all of the stone tools are different down here.


342
0:25:51,326 --> 0:25:55,727
They tell us that people are surviving in a very different environment.


343

It's a wonderful eXample of our ability to adjust to new environments.

Because it means that people were here in Pedra Pintada


370
0:28:10,846 --> 0:28:15,86
at the same time as those hunters in North America.


371
0:28:15,86 --> 0:28:19,166
The date is so early that I find it really difficult to believe


372
0:28:19,166 --> 0:28:23,126
that their ancestors came through that ice-free corridor.


373
0:28:23,126 --> 0:28:26,287
Because if they did, that means they would have had


374
0:28:26,287 --> 0:28:30,807
just a few hundred years to work their way


375
0:28:30,807 --> 0:28:35,807
all the way down through North America, Central America


376
0:28:35,807 --> 0:28:37,406
and down here to the Amazon basin,


377
0:28:37,406 --> 0:28:41,487
adapting to all the diverse environments as they went.


378
0:28:41,487 --> 0:28:46,86
I don't believe it.


379
0:28:46,86 --> 0:28:48,807
It now looks even more unlikely


380
0:28:48,807 --> 0:28:55,446
that the ice-free corridor was the first route into the Americas.


381
0:28:55,446 --> 0:29:1,767
The dates from the Cave of the Painted Rock just don't fit.


382
0:29:1,767 --> 0:29:5,606
But there's another even more incredible discovery


383
0:29:5,606 --> 0:29:12,886
from South America that should settle this argument for good.


384
0:29:12,886 --> 0:29:18,47
The archaeological trail leads 5,000 kilometres south


385
0:29:18,47 --> 0:29:23,287
to a part of Chile, called Los Lagos, the lake district,


386
0:29:23,287 --> 0:29:33,606
famous for its stunning, volcanic landscape.


387
0:29:33,606 --> 0:29:36,7
It's the middle of the Chilean winter,


388
0:29:36,7 --> 0:29:39,326
and after the heat and humidity of Brazil,


389
0:29:39,326 --> 0:29:45,967
the conditions feel very different here.


390
0:29:45,967 --> 0:29:48,166
I'm headed to a place called Monte verde,


391
0:29:48,166 --> 0:29:52,86
a tiny hamlet of no real significance at all,


392
0:29:52,86 --> 0:29:54,126
were it not for the fact it's the site


393
0:29:54,126 --> 0:29:57,207
of perhaps the most important archaeological discovery


394
0:29:57,207 --> 0:30:3,47
in the whole of the Americas.


395
0:30:3,47 --> 0:30:17,926
The finds from Monte Verde are nothing short of miraculous.


396
0:30:17,926 --> 0:30:19,686
It's quite strange, there's no evidence at all


397
0:30:19,686 --> 0:30:22,686
of it ever having been an archaeological site.


398
0:30:22,686 --> 0:30:24,727
There are sheep grazing.


399
0:30:24,727 --> 0:30:27,767
There's nothing obvious at all.


400
0:30:27,767 --> 0:30:32,446
But a few years back, local villagers came across something strange


401
0:30:32,446 --> 0:30:35,767
sticking out of the river bank.


402
0:30:35,767 --> 0:30:38,567
Bones from a mastodon,


403
0:30:38,567 --> 0:30:43,166
a prehistoric relative of the modern elephant.


404
0:30:43,166 --> 0:30:45,326
It was a bank just like this that


405
0:30:45,326 --> 0:30:47,807
the animal bones were originally found in


406
0:30:47,807 --> 0:30:54,686
that alerted people to the fact that this was an archaeological site.


407
0:30:54,686 --> 0:30:56,527
As eXperts dug down,


408
0:30:56,527 --> 0:31:5,366
they discovered much more than just ancient animal bones.


409
0:31:5,366 --> 0:31:7,126
Layer by layer,


410
0:31:7,126 --> 0:31:12,446
the remains of an entire human settlement emerged.


411
0:31:12,446 --> 0:31:17,7
Home to a community of perhaps 20 or 30 people,


412
0:31:17,7 --> 0:31:21,646
with shelters, work areas and rubbish tips.


413
0:31:21,646 --> 0:31:29,247
A unique relic of our prehistoric past.


414
0:31:29,247 --> 0:31:34,86
The main structure on this site was a very long hut, 20 metres long.


415
0:31:34,86 --> 0:31:36,926
I'm gonna have a go at measuring it out,


416
0:31:36,926 --> 0:31:38,606
but I think I might come into some difficulties,


417
0:31:38,606 --> 0:31:42,646
because of where the stream is today.


418
0:31:42,646 --> 0:31:48,7
Because this log is actually around about 7 metres long.


419
0:31:48,7 --> 0:31:49,126
(CHUCKLES)


420
0:31:49,126 --> 0:31:51,527
Ten metres is gonna take me up to there.


421
0:31:51,527 --> 0:31:53,47
I don't want to go any further,


422
0:31:53,47 --> 0:31:55,287
'cause I don't want to end up in that very cold stream.


423
0:31:55,287 --> 0:32:0,166
But you can imagine how far this hut extended.


424
0:32:0,166 --> 0:32:3,767
And amazingly, we know how this hut was built,


425
0:32:3,767 --> 0:32:8,207
because the remains of the wooden stakes and the animal hides that covered it


426
0:32:8,207 --> 0:32:12,287
were preserved in the waterlogged ground.


427
0:32:12,287 --> 0:32:16,207
And inside this long hut the archaeologists found hearths,


428
0:32:16,207 --> 0:32:19,366
and in them the remains of nuts and berries and seeds


429
0:32:19,366 --> 0:32:20,727
that people had been eating.


430
0:32:20,727 --> 0:32:22,926
The hearths were lined with clay.


431
0:32:22,926 --> 0:32:27,207
And in part of this clay that presumably was wet at some point,


432
0:32:27,207 --> 0:32:37,287
there was somebody's footprint.


433
0:32:37,287 --> 0:32:41,807
About 30 metres away was this strange outline


434
0:32:41,807 --> 0:32:46,727
of what was, perhaps, another much smaller hut.


435
0:32:46,727 --> 0:32:50,7
Outside it there were butchered mastodon bones,


436
0:32:50,7 --> 0:32:53,446
but inside it there were some very intriguing finds indeed.


437
0:32:53,446 --> 0:32:56,247
Some plant remains, a few of them seaweeds


438
0:32:56,247 --> 0:33:2,166
that are still used by the Mapuche Indians today as medicines.


439
0:33:2,166 --> 0:33:7,807
Incredibly, the team even discovered the remains of potato skins.


440
0:33:7,807 --> 0:33:11,7
It's the first evidence anywhere in the world


441
0:33:11,7 --> 0:33:14,406
of humans using, eating potatoes.


442
0:33:14,406 --> 0:33:19,326
It's amazing to have this degree of preservation on an archaeological site.


443
0:33:19,326 --> 0:33:27,846
This really is a treasure trove.


444
0:33:27,846 --> 0:33:32,846
Monte Verde gives us an incredibly rare and wonderful window


445
0:33:32,846 --> 0:33:36,446
into our ancestors' daily lives.


446
0:33:36,446 --> 0:33:38,7
But for all that,


447
0:33:38,7 --> 0:33:49,567
what's most astonishing about Monte Verde is its age.


448
0:33:49,567 --> 0:33:54,567
The 50,000-odd artefacts from the site are now stored here


449
0:33:54,567 --> 0:34:2,846
at the University of Southern Chile.


450
0:34:2,846 --> 0:34:6,767
The archaeological finds from Monte verde really are extraordinary.


451
0:34:6,767 --> 0:34:10,726
This piece of wood here has obviously been worked by human hand.


452
0:34:10,726 --> 0:34:14,7
It's been drilled or gouged into here.


453
0:34:14,7 --> 0:34:16,527
Perhaps used to make fire.


454
0:34:16,527 --> 0:34:18,927
This piece of wood has been sharpened into a point.


455
0:34:18,927 --> 0:34:22,567
It was found stuck in the ground, as though it was a tent peg.


456
0:34:22,567 --> 0:34:24,686
And this is really wonderful.


457
0:34:24,686 --> 0:34:28,766
This is a piece of mastodon hide.


458
0:34:28,766 --> 0:34:35,367
Just look at that.


459
0:34:35,367 --> 0:34:39,567
Using radiocarbon dating on charred wood from the site,


460
0:34:39,567 --> 0:34:45,527
scientists could pinpoint its age.


461
0:34:45,527 --> 0:34:47,246
And what those dates tell us


462
0:34:47,246 --> 0:34:50,367
is that there were people down here in southern Chile


463
0:34:50,367 --> 0:34:53,286
1 4,500 years ago.


464
0:34:53,286 --> 0:34:57,847
That's even earlier than the evidence I looked at in Brazil.


465
0:34:57,847 --> 0:35:1,686
So early as to completely rule out the idea


466
0:35:1,686 --> 0:35:5,527
that the first Americans came through the ice-free corridor


467
0:35:5,527 --> 0:35:8,206
once and for all.


468
0:35:8,206 --> 0:35:10,646
People must have got to the Americas


469
0:35:10,646 --> 0:35:14,487
long before the corridor appeared.


470
0:35:14,487 --> 0:35:16,487
But how did people get here,


471
0:35:16,487 --> 0:35:28,686
when the way down through North America was blocked by solid ice?


472
0:35:28,686 --> 0:35:35,246
Well, maybe I've just been missing the obvious


473
0:35:35,246 --> 0:35:46,206
and there was another way we could have reached this continent.


474
0:35:46,206 --> 0:35:49,407
Up until now, I've assumed that people got into the Americas


475
0:35:49,407 --> 0:35:51,806
from the north, from Beringia.


476
0:35:51,806 --> 0:35:53,327
But what if they didn't?


477
0:35:53,327 --> 0:35:57,527
What if they came straight from Asia from across the ocean?


478
0:35:57,527 --> 0:36:0,327
Then the ice sheets wouldn't have even been an issue.


479
0:36:0,327 --> 0:36:11,887
Is it really such a crazy idea?


480
0:36:11,887 --> 0:36:15,527
If the forefathers of those early South Americans


481
0:36:15,527 --> 0:36:19,206
couldn't have arrived through the ice-free corridor,


482
0:36:19,206 --> 0:36:26,766
then maybe they did come across the Pacific.


483
0:36:26,766 --> 0:36:29,606
And if they did, that might eXplain


484
0:36:29,606 --> 0:36:36,47
one of the great mysteries of our human journey.


485
0:36:36,47 --> 0:36:39,166
I'm back in Brazil, this time in Rio de Janeiro,


486
0:36:39,166 --> 0:36:42,447
where I'm going to see some very ancient human remains


487
0:36:42,447 --> 0:36:45,567
that I'm hoping will shed some light on this idea


488
0:36:45,567 --> 0:36:57,527
of our migration across the Pacific.


489
0:36:57,527 --> 0:36:59,606
So precious are these remains


490
0:36:59,606 --> 0:37:3,286
that they've been kept for 30 years under lock and key


491
0:37:3,286 --> 0:37:6,7
at Brazil's National Museum.


492
0:37:6,7 --> 0:37:9,487
This beautiful skull has been nicknamed Luzia.


493
0:37:9,487 --> 0:37:13,327
It belonged to a woman who was in her early 20s when she died.


494
0:37:13,327 --> 0:37:17,686
And it dates to around 1 3,000 years ago.


495
0:37:17,686 --> 0:37:21,47
But it's not just the date that I'm interested in.


496
0:37:21,47 --> 0:37:28,407
It's what she looks like.


497
0:37:28,407 --> 0:37:30,686
Anthropologist Walter Neves


498
0:37:30,686 --> 0:37:35,527
believes that he's uncovered a secret about Luzia.


499
0:37:35,527 --> 0:37:37,967
Well, this is Luzia's skull.


500
0:37:37,967 --> 0:37:43,967
And the bad news are that she doesn't look like she should look like.


501
0:37:43,967 --> 0:37:45,806
So what would you expect her to look like?


502
0:37:45,806 --> 0:37:47,447
Well, as you know,


503
0:37:47,447 --> 0:37:50,726
Native Americans came from East Asia.


504
0:37:50,726 --> 0:37:55,967
And I will show you a typical skull from East Asia.


505
0:37:55,967 --> 0:37:58,327
And as you can see,


506
0:37:58,327 --> 0:38:1,7
they have very different faces.


507
0:38:1,7 --> 0:38:3,126
One of the greatest differences,


508
0:38:3,126 --> 0:38:5,206
in terms of facial morphology,


509
0:38:5,206 --> 0:38:7,286
happens in the cheekbones.


510
0:38:7,286 --> 0:38:9,567
You see that Asians,


511
0:38:9,567 --> 0:38:12,367
they have very wide cheekbones.


512
0:38:12,367 --> 0:38:13,487
-ROBERTS: Yes. -Okay?


513
0:38:13,487 --> 0:38:15,766
Kind of laterally projecting.


514
0:38:15,766 --> 0:38:18,206
-Yes, it gives this very wide face. -That's right.


515
0:38:18,206 --> 0:38:20,766
-Doesn't it, across the cheekbones? -That's right. Yeah, yeah.


516
0:38:20,766 --> 0:38:28,887
If you go to Luzia, you find kind of narrow cheekbones.


517
0:38:28,887 --> 0:38:32,327
Okay, if Luzia and her population


518
0:38:32,327 --> 0:38:36,487
don't look like East Asians and they don't look like modern Native Americans,


519
0:38:36,487 --> 0:38:38,126
who do they look like?


520
0:38:38,126 --> 0:38:41,126
We discovered that, amazingly,


521
0:38:41,126 --> 0:38:46,766
she looks much more like Australasians,


522
0:38:46,766 --> 0:38:51,927
than with East Asians or Native Americans, if you want.


523
0:38:51,927 --> 0:38:56,487
ROBERTS: Australasian? It sounds bizarre.


524
0:38:56,487 --> 0:38:58,447
But Walter found that Luzia


525
0:38:58,447 --> 0:39:4,847
had more similarities with Australasian skulls than any others.


526
0:39:4,847 --> 0:39:7,726
And when Luzia's features are reconstructed,


527
0:39:7,726 --> 0:39:9,567
it's even more obvious


528
0:39:9,567 --> 0:39:17,726
that she looks nothing like modern Siberians or Native Americans.


529
0:39:17,726 --> 0:39:24,567
It suggests a superhuman feat of seafaring.


530
0:39:24,567 --> 0:39:29,447
So if these early Americans look more like Australians or Melanesians,


531
0:39:29,447 --> 0:39:32,487
does that mean that they arrived here across the Pacific?


532
0:39:32,487 --> 0:39:36,327
No, no, no, because if you take into account


533
0:39:36,327 --> 0:39:41,646
the technology available like 1 2-1 3,000 years ago,


534
0:39:41,646 --> 0:39:43,367
that would be impossible.


535
0:39:43,367 --> 0:39:44,447
Okay.


536
0:39:44,447 --> 0:39:47,367
But then how do you explain the fact that


537
0:39:47,367 --> 0:39:52,487
modern living Native Americans don't look like Luzia,


538
0:39:52,487 --> 0:39:54,327
they do look like East Asians?


539
0:39:54,327 --> 0:39:56,367
It's very easy to explain.


540
0:39:56,367 --> 0:39:59,286
Because if you go back to Asia,


541
0:39:59,286 --> 0:40:3,126
around 1 4,000 years ago,


542
0:40:3,126 --> 0:40:5,487
the people that lives today in Asia,


543
0:40:5,487 --> 0:40:8,847
with their typical morphology, they were not there.


544
0:40:8,847 --> 0:40:10,887
Right, so you're saying that


545
0:40:10,887 --> 0:40:13,487
Luzia's people came into the Americas


546
0:40:13,487 --> 0:40:15,646
before the appearance of East Asian features.


547
0:40:15,646 --> 0:40:17,367
Definitely, definitely.


548
0:40:17,367 --> 0:40:20,766
But they used the same route


549
0:40:20,766 --> 0:40:25,806
as the Mongoloids did some couple of thousand years later.


550
0:40:25,806 --> 0:40:27,806
So this is absolutely


551
0:40:27,806 --> 0:40:31,967
not evidence for any sort of trans-Pacific crossing.


552
0:40:31,967 --> 0:40:35,887
Definitely not a crossing.


553
0:40:35,887 --> 0:40:38,527
ROBERTS: Walter is adamant that Stone Age people


554
0:40:38,527 --> 0:40:43,47
could not have made it across the Pacific.


555
0:40:43,47 --> 0:40:46,606
He believes Luzia's ancestors did come from Asia,


556
0:40:46,606 --> 0:40:53,766
but before those classic East Asian features became common.


557
0:40:53,766 --> 0:40:57,7
However, Walter hasn't solved the mystery


558
0:40:57,7 --> 0:41:8,327
of how Luzia's ancestors found a way past all that ice.


559
0:41:8,327 --> 0:41:10,367
Well, it looks like I've reached a dead end again.


560
0:41:10,367 --> 0:41:15,927
There doesn't seem to be any evidence for a migration across the Pacific.


561
0:41:15,927 --> 0:41:20,407
So that means the only way into South America was from the north,


562
0:41:20,407 --> 0:41:26,206
across the ice sheets, but that just doesn't make sense.


563
0:41:26,206 --> 0:41:30,47
Unless, rather than coming across the ice,


564
0:41:30,47 --> 0:41:35,567
the first Americans found a way to get around it.


565
0:41:35,567 --> 0:41:39,246
Perhaps the sea might hold the answer after all.


566
0:41:39,246 --> 0:41:41,806
If they didn't cross the open ocean,


567
0:41:41,806 --> 0:41:46,806
could they possibly have followed the coast?


568
0:41:46,806 --> 0:41:51,86
It still seems unlikely.


569
0:41:51,86 --> 0:41:53,726
It's time to retrace my steps,


570
0:41:53,726 --> 0:42:3,927
and head back up north to the west coast of Canada.


571
0:42:3,927 --> 0:42:9,86
There should be evidence along these shores.


572
0:42:9,86 --> 0:42:11,726
But there's a problem.


573
0:42:11,726 --> 0:42:13,686
How do you search for something


574
0:42:13,686 --> 0:42:17,967
that's hidden beneath a hundred metres of water?


575
0:42:17,967 --> 0:42:19,967
Well, at the peak of the last Ice Age


576
0:42:19,967 --> 0:42:23,86
the water level would have been so much lower than it is today


577
0:42:23,86 --> 0:42:29,927
that many of these fjords would have been steep-sided valleys.


578
0:42:29,927 --> 0:42:34,407
Today, those same valleys, where our ancestors may have lived,


579
0:42:34,407 --> 0:42:37,567
are full of water.


580
0:42:37,567 --> 0:42:40,166
So as much as this could be the perfect place


581
0:42:40,166 --> 0:42:42,567
to look for signs of a coastal route...


582
0:42:42,567 --> 0:42:52,527
The frustrating thing is that so much of the evidence is probably down there.


583
0:42:52,527 --> 0:42:55,327
...this is the point at which direct evidence


584
0:42:55,327 --> 0:43:0,166
of humans in North America runs out.


585
0:43:0,166 --> 0:43:18,206
But can we discover whether such a coastal journey was at least possible?


586
0:43:18,206 --> 0:43:26,126
I'm in Vancouver to meet forensic botanist Rolf Mathewes.


587
0:43:26,126 --> 0:43:31,86
His skills are often called upon in high-profile murder cases.

590
0:43:34,726 --> 0:43:37,887
of the little girl was discovered floating in...


591
0:43:37,887 --> 0:43:41,686
ROBERTS: When the body of a young girl was recently discovered in a lake,


592
0:43:41,686 --> 0:43:45,47
Rolf's identification of plant remains in her hair


593
0:43:45,47 --> 0:43:51,487
helped convict the killer.


594
0:43:51,487 --> 0:43:53,726
But when he's not solving murders,


595
0:43:53,726 --> 0:44:2,86
Rolf has a passion for trying to solve riddles of the past.


596
0:44:2,86 --> 0:44:4,407
And the evidence he relies on


597
0:44:4,407 --> 0:44:9,887
is so minuscule as to be invisible to the naked eye.


598
0:44:9,887 --> 0:44:13,367
This is one pollen grain of a sedge.


599
0:44:13,367 --> 0:44:15,527
And they're fairly nondescript-looking things,


600
0:44:15,527 --> 0:44:17,847
but I can put it on the screen over here.


601
0:44:17,847 --> 0:44:22,206
It's only about thirty-thousandths of a millimetre in size.


602
0:44:22,206 --> 0:44:26,606
So this is a sedge pollen grain from a marine core?


603
0:44:26,606 --> 0:44:27,927
Well, it's not a marine core.


604
0:44:27,927 --> 0:44:31,606
It's a core taken under 30 metres of water in the Hecate Strait.


605
0:44:31,606 --> 0:44:35,47
When the sea level was much lower, this area was dry land


606
0:44:35,47 --> 0:44:37,447
with marshes and rivers and lakes on it.


607
0:44:37,447 --> 0:44:39,766
-But now it's submerged. -Now it's submerged.


608
0:44:39,766 --> 0:44:41,527
So have you got dates on this pollen, then?


609
0:44:41,527 --> 0:44:43,927
Have you been able to radiocarbon date them?


610
0:44:43,927 --> 0:44:46,206
We can't radiocarbon date individual pollen grains,


611
0:44:46,206 --> 0:44:48,166
but this core where this sample has come from,


612
0:44:48,166 --> 0:44:52,126
this sample is about 1 7,000 years old.


613
0:44:52,126 --> 0:44:54,327
So 1 7,000 years ago, then,


614
0:44:54,327 --> 0:44:56,686
in the Queen Charlotte Islands here off the west coast of Canada,


615
0:44:56,686 --> 0:45:0,367
the ice sheets are pulling back and we've got vegetation.


616
0:45:0,367 --> 0:45:2,487
Not as a single straight-line wall.


617
0:45:2,487 --> 0:45:5,126
It came back in very irregular lobes,


618
0:45:5,126 --> 0:45:6,806
and pulled back at various rates,


619
0:45:6,806 --> 0:45:10,166
depending on how thick the ice was, and so forth.


620
0:45:10,166 --> 0:45:12,367
Now, what I'm really interested in is


621
0:45:12,367 --> 0:45:15,447
the possibility of a coastal route


622
0:45:15,447 --> 0:45:18,126
into North America for the first colonisers.


623
0:45:18,126 --> 0:45:20,887
-Yes. -So is this,


624
0:45:20,887 --> 0:45:24,86
the pollen on those islands, an isolated incidence


625
0:45:24,86 --> 0:45:27,407
or do we actually find vegetation along the coast?


626
0:45:27,407 --> 0:45:30,806
By the time you get to about 1 6,000 years ago,


627
0:45:30,806 --> 0:45:34,7
there are a number of ice-free areas from the Gulf of Alaska


628
0:45:34,7 --> 0:45:37,367
all the way to down to southern British Columbia,


629
0:45:37,367 --> 0:45:40,166
which were also de-glaciating rapidly.


630
0:45:40,166 --> 0:45:41,766
So do you think


631
0:45:41,766 --> 0:45:46,47
humans could have been coming down this de-glaciated route?


632
0:45:46,47 --> 0:45:47,806
Well, I think absolutely.


633
0:45:47,806 --> 0:45:49,407
The possibilities are very strong.


634
0:45:49,407 --> 0:45:52,686
In fact, the only other route I can think of that they could have come


635
0:45:52,686 --> 0:45:55,7
is really down the coastal corridor,


636
0:45:55,7 --> 0:45:58,806
using these early de-glaciated areas as stopping places,


637
0:45:58,806 --> 0:46:10,367
as they worked their way south.


638
0:46:10,367 --> 0:46:17,367
ROBERTS: At last it feels like I'm getting somewhere.


639
0:46:17,367 --> 0:46:21,166
Before I met Rolf, I imagined the ice rising straight up out of the sea,


640
0:46:21,166 --> 0:46:24,967
and stretching from coast to coast, forming an impenetrable barrier.


641
0:46:24,967 --> 0:46:27,447
But what the pollen in his cores proves


642
0:46:27,447 --> 0:46:29,166
is that it would have been at least possible


643
0:46:29,166 --> 0:46:32,606
for humans to have got around the edge of the ice along the coast,


644
0:46:32,606 --> 0:46:39,766
long before the ice-free corridor opened further inland.


645
0:46:39,766 --> 0:46:42,606
But it wouldn't have been easy.


646
0:46:42,606 --> 0:46:46,847
Families inching along the coast would often have found the way blocked


647
0:46:46,847 --> 0:46:52,206
where the ice still reached right down to the sea.


648
0:46:52,206 --> 0:46:55,126
So if our ancestors did come this way,


649
0:46:55,126 --> 0:47:1,47
then at least part of their journey must have been made by boat.


650
0:47:1,47 --> 0:47:9,527
But is there anything to support this idea of ancient seafaring?


651
0:47:9,527 --> 0:47:11,567
1,500 kilometres away,


652
0:47:11,567 --> 0:47:13,766

0:47:13,766 --> 0:47:17,567

I'm on my way to a string of rocky islands


657
0:47:28,806 --> 0:47:31,447
just off the southern Californian coast.


658
0:47:31,447 --> 0:47:33,646
They're called the Channel Islands.


659
0:47:33,646 --> 0:47:37,367
And the one I'm interested in is Santa Rosa.

0:47:37,367 --> 0:47:39,286

661
0:47:39,286 --> 0:47:41,887

Because back then,


697
0:51:9,646 --> 0:51:16,86
this island would still have been 1 0 kilometres away from the mainland.


698
0:51:16,86 --> 0:51:20,86
And that means the only way to have got here


699
0:51:20,86 --> 0:51:27,327
would have been by boat.


700
0:51:27,327 --> 0:51:31,126
So it doesn't seem so far-fetched to imagine


701
0:51:31,126 --> 0:51:34,246
that the very first people to reach America


702
0:51:34,246 --> 0:51:39,726
might also have had small boats,

in the hope that around the corner


705
0:51:46,646 --> 0:51:54,126
the ice would have melted enough to allow them to feel dry land again.


706

But perhaps that's rather a lot to read into a couple of old leg bones.

What's so fascinating is this is a rare type of DNA.

0:53:3,407 --> 0:53:7,487
It's only found among 2% of American Indians.

0:53:10,726 --> 0:53:13,847
with modern samples from across the two continents,


728
0:53:13,847 --> 0:53:15,847
he noticed a pattern.


729
0:53:15,847 --> 0:53:18,927

We've found it among the Caiap6 Indians in coastal Ecuador.

0:53:42,447 --> 0:53:47,766
And here in prehistoric burials in Tierra del Fuego.


737
0:53:47,766 --> 0:53:50,847
All the way down the Pacific coast.


738
0:53:50,847 --> 0:53:54,206
Primarily Pacific coastal in distribution.


739
0:53:54,206 --> 0:53:56,447
So for you, does this really clinch it?


740
0:53:56,447 --> 0:54:0,447
Does this mean that there was a coastal dispersal?


741
0:54:0,447 --> 0:54:3,367
I think this is the best evidence to date.


742
0:54:3,367 --> 0:54:6,206
Indirect evidence of an ancient coastal migration,


743
0:54:6,206 --> 0:54:10,646
that this particular group gradually moved down the Pacific coast,


744
0:54:10,646 --> 0:54:13,7
taking advantage of coastal resources.


745
0:54:13,7 --> 0:54:20,407
And left behind descendants today who still live in all of these areas.


746
0:54:20,407 --> 0:54:24,7
ROBERTS: It feels as if the great mystery of this,


747
0:54:24,7 --> 0:54:29,527
our last human journey, is resolved.


748
0:54:29,527 --> 0:54:32,206
Looking at all these strands of evidence, then,


749
0:54:32,206 --> 0:54:35,887
it seems the most likely route taken by the first Americans


750
0:54:35,887 --> 0:54:38,646
was not down through the ice sheets,


751
0:54:38,646 --> 0:54:40,646
as many archaeologists used to think,


752
0:54:40,646 --> 0:54:48,646
but all the way down along the Pacific coast of the Americas.


753
0:54:48,646 --> 0:54:51,686
We can imagine those first pioneers


754
0:54:51,686 --> 0:54:56,766
paddling along the edge of the ice some 17,000 years ago.


755
0:54:56,766 --> 0:55:0,47
And their descendants moving down along the coast,


756
0:55:0,47 --> 0:55:3,126
reaching the southernmost tip of the Americas,


757
0:55:3,126 --> 0:55:8,726
within just a couple of thousand years.


758
0:55:8,726 --> 0:55:11,246
With a foothold in this New World,


759
0:55:11,246 --> 0:55:13,766
the first Americans flourished here,


760
0:55:13,766 --> 0:55:17,126
until eventually, some 15,000 years later,


761
0:55:17,126 --> 0:55:27,327
they were to come face to face with some distant members of their family tree.


762
0:55:27,327 --> 0:55:29,286
In 1492,


763
0:55:29,286 --> 0:55:34,967
a small group of European eXplorers arrived on the shores of the Americas,


764
0:55:34,967 --> 0:55:44,327
where they were met by bewildered locals.


765
0:55:44,327 --> 0:55:47,47
Even though both groups were branches


766
0:55:47,47 --> 0:55:51,927
of that original exodus from Africa some 70,000 years ago,


767
0:55:51,927 --> 0:55:55,646
the Europeans didn't see the inhabitants of America


768
0:55:55,646 --> 0:55:57,407
as long-lost cousins,


769
0:55:57,407 --> 0:56:2,686
but rather as wild, savage, even unhuman.


770
0:56:2,686 --> 0:56:5,967
And the Native Americans saw those strange visitors


771
0:56:5,967 --> 0:56:10,86
as deities possessed of supernatural powers.


772
0:56:10,86 --> 0:56:23,646
They just didn't recognise each other.


773
0:56:23,646 --> 0:56:29,286
Over the neXt 400 years or so, this physical and cultural divide


774
0:56:29,286 --> 0:56:36,47
would help fuel the slaughter of the native people.


775
0:56:36,47 --> 0:56:48,327
Even conservative estimates run into hundreds of thousands dead.


776
0:56:48,327 --> 0:56:52,206
A tragedy which seems so much more senseless


777
0:56:52,206 --> 0:56:59,166
in light of what we now know about our human story.


778
0:56:59,166 --> 0:57:4,806
Our origins in Africa, the journeys our ancestors made


779
0:57:4,806 --> 0:57:11,527
and the close genetic bond we all share.


780
0:57:11,527 --> 0:57:15,567
The differences between us all are really just superficial.


781
0:57:15,567 --> 0:57:21,686
We're all members of a young species that goes back less than 200,000 years,


782
0:57:21,686 --> 0:57:25,166
and we're all surprisingly closely related.


783
0:57:25,166 --> 0:57:26,646
This is the story


784
0:57:26,646 --> 0:57:29,487
that has emerged from the study of stones,


785
0:57:29,487 --> 0:57:31,887
bones and our genes.


786
0:57:31,887 --> 0:57:35,806
That wherever we've ended up all over the world,


787
0:57:35,806 --> 0:57:39,7
we are Africans under the skin.


788
0:57:39,7 --> 0:57:44,646
And uncovering that story, retracing the steps of our ancestors,


789
0:57:44,646 --> 0:57:49,206
has given me a profound sense of our common humanity,


790
0:57:49,206 --> 0:59:49,206
our shared past and our shared future.
