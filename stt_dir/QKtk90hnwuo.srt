0:0:0,429 --> 0:0:8,97
THE PRESIDENT: Hello, North Carolina! (Applause.)
Hello, Mount Holly! (Applause.) Thank you,


2
0:0:8,97 --> 0:0:15,86
Juan, for that introduction. I did not know
he was a preacher. (Laughter.) He must be


3
0:0:15,86 --> 0:0:25,9
at least a deacon. (Laughter.) I was hearing
-- "Welll" -- (Laughter.) He was starting


4
0:0:25,9 --> 0:0:34,21
to get the spirit up here. I'm going to take
Juan on the road to introduce me everywhere.


5
0:0:34,21 --> 0:0:39,579
(Laughter.) Can I hear an "amen"?


6
0:0:39,579 --> 0:0:41,37
AUDIENCE: Amen!


7
0:0:41,37 --> 0:0:44,5
THE PRESIDENT: Amen.


8
0:0:44,5 --> 0:0:48,809
I want to thank Mark Hernandez, Ricky McDowell
-- (applause) -- and Martin Daum for hosting


9
0:0:48,809 --> 0:0:53,59
us and being such great tour guides. Thank
you so much, everybody. Give them a big round


10
0:0:53,59 --> 0:0:56,18
of applause. (Applause.)


11
0:0:56,18 --> 0:1:4,46
We've got a few outstanding North Carolinians
in the house. You've got your Governor, Bev


12
0:1:4,46 --> 0:1:13,45
Perdue, is here. (Applause.) Your mayors,
Bryan Hough and Anthony Foxx are here. (Applause.)


13
0:1:13,45 --> 0:1:19,53
Two outstanding Congressmen, Mel Watt and
Heath Shuler are here. (Applause.) Thank you


14
0:1:19,53 --> 0:1:20,659
all for being here.


15
0:1:20,659 --> 0:1:29,86
It is good to be in North Carolina. Anthony
Foxx pointed out that I decided to wear a


16
0:1:29,86 --> 0:1:40,39
tie that could be a Tar Heel -- (applause)
-- but it's got a little Duke color in there,


17
0:1:40,39 --> 0:1:40,39
too.


18
0:1:40,39 --> 0:1:40,39
AUDIENCE: Booo --


19
0:1:40,39 --> 0:1:55,88
THE PRESIDENT: I didn’t want to get in trouble
with anybody, so I was hedging my bets. (Laughter.)


20
0:1:55,88 --> 0:2:2,88
I always tell people I am one of the best
advertisers for North Carolina. I love this


21
0:2:2,88 --> 0:2:10,729
state. (Applause.) Love this state. Everybody
here is so nice, so welcoming. Even the folks


22
0:2:10,729 --> 0:2:22,12
who don't vote for me, they're nice to me.
They usually wave five fingers. (Laughter.)


23
0:2:22,12 --> 0:2:25,219
So it's just a great pleasure.


24
0:2:25,219 --> 0:2:30,209
And I just had a chance to see some of the
folks who are doing the work here today. I


25
0:2:30,209 --> 0:2:35,739
couldn't be more impressed. Some people have
been here -- like Juan -- 32 years, 25 years.


26
0:2:35,739 --> 0:2:40,309
Some folks have been here for four months,
or six months, have just gotten hired. But


27
0:2:40,309 --> 0:2:45,49
everybody had such pride in their work.


28
0:2:45,49 --> 0:2:52,49
And the Freighterline trucks that you’re
making here at this plant run on natural gas,


29
0:2:52,49 --> 0:2:57,299
and that makes them quieter, it makes them
better for the environment, it makes them


30
0:2:57,299 --> 0:3:4,589
cheaper to fill up than they would be with
diesel. I hear you sold your 1,000th natural


31
0:3:4,589 --> 0:3:12,73
gas truck last November -– (applause) -- the
first company to reach that milestone. And


32
0:3:12,73 --> 0:3:19,849
it was made right here in Mount Holly. (Applause.)
And last year, this plant added more than


33
0:3:19,849 --> 0:3:27,729
1,000 workers, hiring back a lot of folks
who were laid off during the recession. (Applause.)


34
0:3:27,729 --> 0:3:30,18
That is something to be proud of.


35
0:3:30,18 --> 0:3:37,589
Now, here at Daimler, you're not just building
trucks. You're building better trucks.


36
0:3:37,589 --> 0:3:38,519
AUDIENCE: That’s right.


37
0:3:38,519 --> 0:3:43,739
THE PRESIDENT: You're building trucks that
use less oil. And you know that’s especially


38
0:3:43,739 --> 0:3:47,37
important right now because most of you have
probably filled up your gas tank a time or


39
0:3:47,37 --> 0:3:56,599
two in the last week, and you've seen how
quickly the price of gas is going up. A lot


40
0:3:56,599 --> 0:4:4,69
of you may have to drive a distance to work.
Higher gas prices are like a tax straight


41
0:4:4,69 --> 0:4:10,19
out of your paycheck.
And for companies that operate a whole fleet


42
0:4:10,19 --> 0:4:18,199
of trucks, the higher costs can make a big
difference in terms of the profitability of


43
0:4:18,199 --> 0:4:19,5
the company.


44
0:4:19,5 --> 0:4:26,9
Now, here's the thing, though -- this is not
the first time we've seen gas prices spike.


45
0:4:26,9 --> 0:4:32,8
It's been happening for years. Every year,
about this time, gas starts spiking up, and


46
0:4:32,8 --> 0:4:39,509
everybody starts wondering, how high is it
going to go? And every year, politicians start


47
0:4:39,509 --> 0:4:45,24
talking when gas prices go up. They get out
on the campaign trail -- and you and I both


48
0:4:45,24 --> 0:4:51,24
know there are no quick fixes to this problem
-- but listening to them, you'd think there


49
0:4:51,24 --> 0:4:52,8
were.


50
0:4:52,8 --> 0:5:0,2
As a country that has 2 percent of the world's
oil reserves, but uses 20 percent of the world's


51
0:5:0,2 --> 0:5:6,46
oil -- I'm going to repeat that -- we've got
2 percent of the world oil reserves; we use


52
0:5:6,46 --> 0:5:14,4
20 percent. What that means is, as much as
we're doing to increase oil production, we're


53
0:5:14,4 --> 0:5:20,31
not going to be able to just drill our way
out of the problem of high gas prices. Anybody


54
0:5:20,31 --> 0:5:23,949
who tells you otherwise either doesn’t know
what they’re talking about or they aren’t


55
0:5:23,949 --> 0:5:25,659
telling you the truth.


56
0:5:25,659 --> 0:5:32,719
Here is the truth. If we are going to control
our energy future, then we’ve got to have


57
0:5:32,719 --> 0:5:36,649
an all-of-the-above strategy. We’ve got
to develop every source of American energy


58
0:5:36,649 --> 0:5:45,37
-- not just oil and gas, but wind power and
solar power, nuclear power, biofuels. We need


59
0:5:45,37 --> 0:5:51,909
to invest in the technology that will help
us use less oil in our cars and our trucks,


60
0:5:51,909 --> 0:5:57,65
in our buildings, in our factories. That’s
the only solution to the challenge. Because


61
0:5:57,65 --> 0:6:5,499
as we start using less, that lowers the demand,
prices come down. It's pretty straightforward.


62
0:6:5,499 --> 0:6:8,969
That’s the only solution to this challenge.


63
0:6:8,969 --> 0:6:13,34
And that’s the strategy that we’ve now
been pursuing for the last three years. And


64
0:6:13,34 --> 0:6:20,499
I’m proud to say we’ve made progress.
Since I took office, America’s dependence


65
0:6:20,499 --> 0:6:28,469
on foreign oil has gone down every single
year. In fact, in 2010, it went under 50 percent


66
0:6:28,469 --> 0:6:30,469
for the first time in 13 years.


67
0:6:30,469 --> 0:6:38,3
You wouldn’t know it from listening to some
of these folks out here -- (laughter) -- some


68
0:6:38,3 --> 0:6:48,909
of these folks -- (laughter) -- but a key
part of our energy strategy has been to increase


69
0:6:48,909 --> 0:6:54,33
safe, responsible oil production here at home.
Under my administration, America is producing


70
0:6:54,33 --> 0:7:1,15
more oil today than any time in the last eight
years. Under my administration, we’ve quadrupled


71
0:7:1,15 --> 0:7:6,789
the number of operating oilrigs to a record
high. We’ve got more oilrigs operating now


72
0:7:6,789 --> 0:7:13,259
than we’ve ever seen. We’ve opened up
millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration.


73
0:7:13,259 --> 0:7:18,93
We’ve approved more than 400 drilling permits
that follow new safety standards after we


74
0:7:18,93 --> 0:7:21,409
had that mess down in the Gulf.


75
0:7:21,409 --> 0:7:26,61
We’re approving dozens of new pipelines.
We just announced that we’ll do whatever


76
0:7:26,61 --> 0:7:32,29
we can to speed up construction of a pipeline
in Oklahoma that’s going to relieve a bottleneck


77
0:7:32,29 --> 0:7:36,43
and get more oil to the Gulf -- to the refineries
down there -- and that’s going to help create


78
0:7:36,43 --> 0:7:39,3
jobs, encourage more production.


79
0:7:39,3 --> 0:7:43,909
So these are the facts on oil production.
If somebody tells you we’re not producing


80
0:7:43,909 --> 0:7:48,199
enough oil, they just don’t know the facts.


81
0:7:48,199 --> 0:7:53,52
But how much oil we produce here at home,
because we only have 2 percent and we use


82
0:7:53,52 --> 0:7:59,3
20, that’s not going to set the price of
gas worldwide, or here in the United States.


83
0:7:59,3 --> 0:8:5,159
Oil is bought and sold on the world market.
And the biggest thing that’s causing the


84
0:8:5,159 --> 0:8:8,759
price of oil to rise right now is instability
in the Middle East. You guys have been hearing


85
0:8:8,759 --> 0:8:15,909
about what’s happening with Iran; there
are other oil producers that are having problems.


86
0:8:15,909 --> 0:8:20,199
And so people have gotten uncertain. And when
uncertainty increases, then sometimes you


87
0:8:20,199 --> 0:8:25,9
see speculation on Wall Street that drives
up gas prices even more.


88
0:8:25,9 --> 0:8:31,49
But here's the thing. Over the long term,
the biggest reason oil prices will go up is


89
0:8:31,49 --> 0:8:35,669
there's just growing demand in countries like
China and India and Brazil. There are a lot


90
0:8:35,669 --> 0:8:45,5
of people there. In 2010 alone, China added
nearly 10 million cars on its roads. Think


91
0:8:45,5 --> 0:8:54,999
about that -- 2010, 10 million new cars. People
in China, folks in India, folks in Brazil


92
0:8:54,999 --> 0:8:59,49
-- they're going to want cars, too, as their
standard of living goes up, and that means


93
0:8:59,49 --> 0:9:5,949
more demand for oil, and that's going to kick
up the price of oil worldwide. Those numbers


94
0:9:5,949 --> 0:9:8,6
are only going to get bigger over time.


95
0:9:8,6 --> 0:9:16,35
So what does that mean for us? It means we
can't just keep on relying on the old ways


96
0:9:16,35 --> 0:9:22,85
of doing business. We can't just rely on fossil
fuels from the last century. We've got to


97
0:9:22,85 --> 0:9:25,519
continually develop new sources of energy.


98
0:9:25,519 --> 0:9:31,37
And that’s why we've made investments that
have nearly doubled the use of clean, renewable


99
0:9:31,37 --> 0:9:37,769
energies in this country. And thousands of
Americans have jobs because of it. It also


100
0:9:37,769 --> 0:9:41,88
means we’ve got to develop the resources
that we have that are untapped, like natural


101
0:9:41,88 --> 0:9:46,68
gas. We're developing a near hundred-year
supply of natural gas -– and that's something


102
0:9:46,68 --> 0:9:53,55
that we expect could support more than 600,000
jobs by the end of the decade.


103
0:9:53,55 --> 0:9:58,48
And that’s why we've worked with the private
sector to develop a high-tech car battery


104
0:9:58,48 --> 0:10:4,87
that costs half as much as other batteries
and can go up to 300 miles on a single charge.


105
0:10:4,87 --> 0:10:12,43
Think about that. That will save you some
money at the pump. And that is why we are


106
0:10:12,43 --> 0:10:17,92
helping companies like this one right here
and plants like this one right here to make


107
0:10:17,92 --> 0:10:21,94
more cars and trucks that use less oil.


108
0:10:21,94 --> 0:10:29,9
When I ran for office, I went to Detroit and
I gave a speech to automakers where I promised


109
0:10:29,9 --> 0:10:33,25
that I was going to raise fuel standards on
our cars, so that they’d go further on a


110
0:10:33,25 --> 0:10:37,62
gallon of gas. I said we should do the same
thing on trucks. I have to tell you, when


111
0:10:37,62 --> 0:10:43,6
I said it, I didn't get a lot of applause
in the room, because there was a time when


112
0:10:43,6 --> 0:10:49,13
automakers were resisting higher fuel standards
-- because change isn't easy. But you know


113
0:10:49,13 --> 0:10:54,339
what, after three decades of not doing anything,
we got together with the oil companies, we


114
0:10:54,339 --> 0:10:59,759
got together with the unions, we got together
with folks who usually do not see eye to eye,


115
0:10:59,759 --> 0:11:5,259
and we negotiated new fuel economy standards
that are going to make sure our cars average


116
0:11:5,259 --> 0:11:9,88
nearly 55 miles per gallon by the middle of
the next decade. That's nearly double what


117
0:11:9,88 --> 0:11:12,8
they get today -- nearly double. (Applause.)


118
0:11:12,8 --> 0:11:21,769
Now, because of these new standards for cars
and trucks, they're going to -- all going


119
0:11:21,769 --> 0:11:27,29
to be able to go further and use less fuel
every year. And that means pretty soon you’ll


120
0:11:27,29 --> 0:11:32,48
be able to fill up your car every two weeks
instead of every week -– and, over time,


121
0:11:32,48 --> 0:11:35,399
that saves you, a typical family, about $8,000
a year.


122
0:11:35,399 --> 0:11:37,29
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We like that.


123
0:11:37,29 --> 0:11:37,66
THE PRESIDENT: You like that, don't you?


124
0:11:37,66 --> 0:11:40,139
AUDIENCE: Yes! (Applause.)


125
0:11:40,139 --> 0:11:48,68
THE PRESIDENT: Eight thousand dollars -- that's
no joke. We can reduce our oil consumption


126
0:11:48,68 --> 0:11:54,819
by more than 12 billion barrels. And thanks
to the SuperTruck program that we’ve started


127
0:11:54,819 --> 0:12:2,279
with companies like this one, trucks will
be able to save more than $15,000 in fuel


128
0:12:2,279 --> 0:12:6,399
costs every year. Think about that, $15,000.


129
0:12:6,399 --> 0:12:14,889
It looks like somebody might have fainted
up here. Have we got some of the EMS, somebody.


130
0:12:14,889 --> 0:12:23,48
Don’t worry about -- folks do this all the
time in my meetings. (Laughter.) You’ve


131
0:12:23,48 --> 0:12:29,139
always got to eat before you stand for a long
time. That’s a little tip. But they'll be


132
0:12:29,139 --> 0:12:40,97
okay. Just make sure that -- give them a little
room. All right, everybody all right? Okay.


133
0:12:40,97 --> 0:12:49,319
So these trucks can save $15,000 every year.
I want people to think about what that means


134
0:12:49,319 --> 0:12:55,949
for businesses, what it means for consumers.
It is real progress. And it's happening because


135
0:12:55,949 --> 0:13:3,67
of American workers and American know-how.
It's happening because of you. It's happening


136
0:13:3,67 --> 0:13:5,31
because of you.


137
0:13:5,31 --> 0:13:11,509
We’re also making it easier for big companies
-- some of your customers, like UPS and FedEx


138
0:13:11,509 --> 0:13:18,49
-- to make the shift to fuel-efficient cars
and trucks. We call it the National Clean


139
0:13:18,49 --> 0:13:24,22
Fleets Partnership. And since we announced
it last year, the number of companies that


140
0:13:24,22 --> 0:13:31,23
are taking part in it has tripled. And that
means more customers for your trucks. (Applause.)


141
0:13:31,23 --> 0:13:38,72
We're creating more customers for your trucks.


142
0:13:38,72 --> 0:13:45,569
And I am proud to say that the federal government
is leading by example. One thing the federal


143
0:13:45,569 --> 0:13:53,4
government has a lot of is cars and trucks.
We got a lot of cars and we got a lot of trucks.


144
0:13:53,4 --> 0:13:58,459
And so what I did was I directed every department,
every agency in the federal government, to


145
0:13:58,459 --> 0:14:7,199
make sure that by 2015, 100 percent of the
vehicles we buy run on alternative fuels -- 100


146
0:14:7,199 --> 0:14:9,62
percent. (Applause.)


147
0:14:9,62 --> 0:14:19,17
So we’re one of the biggest customers in
the world for cars and trucks and we want


148
0:14:19,17 --> 0:14:27,0
to set that bar high. We want to set a standard
that says by 2015, 100 percent of cars, alternative


149
0:14:27,0 --> 0:14:28,269
fuels.


150
0:14:28,269 --> 0:14:33,18
So we’re making progress, Mount Holly. But
at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter


151
0:14:33,18 --> 0:14:38,879
how much natural gas, or flex-fuel or electric
vehicles you have if there’s no place to


152
0:14:38,879 --> 0:14:45,47
charge them up or fill them up. So that’s
why I’m announcing today a program that


153
0:14:45,47 --> 0:14:50,509
will put our communities on the cutting edge
of what clean energy can do.


154
0:14:50,509 --> 0:14:55,54
To cities and towns all across the country,
what we’re going to say is, if you make


155
0:14:55,54 --> 0:15:1,79
a commitment to buy more advanced vehicles
for your community -- whether they run on


156
0:15:1,79 --> 0:15:8,569
electricity or biofuels or natural gas -- we’ll
help you cut through the red tape and build


157
0:15:8,569 --> 0:15:20,97
fueling stations nearby. (Applause.) And we’ll
offer tax breaks to families that buy these


158
0:15:20,97 --> 0:15:25,519
cars, companies that buy alternative fuel
trucks like the ones that are made right here


159
0:15:25,519 --> 0:15:32,129
at Mount Holly. (Applause.) So we’re going
to give communities across the country more


160
0:15:32,129 --> 0:15:37,29
of an incentive to make the shift to more
energy-efficient cars.


161
0:15:37,29 --> 0:15:46,1
In fact, when I was up in New Hampshire, in
Nashua, they had already converted all their


162
0:15:46,1 --> 0:15:50,16
dump trucks -- they were in a process because
of this program -- they were converting it


163
0:15:50,16 --> 0:15:53,62
to natural gas-driven trucks.


164
0:15:53,62 --> 0:15:59,42
This is something that we did in education
-- we called it Race to the Top. We said we’ll


165
0:15:59,42 --> 0:16:3,259
put in more money but we want you to reform.
We’re going to give you an incentive to


166
0:16:3,259 --> 0:16:8,55
do things in a different way. And if we do
the same thing with clean energy, we can save


167
0:16:8,55 --> 0:16:14,649
consumers money and we can make sure the economy
is more secure. So we’ve got to keep investing


168
0:16:14,649 --> 0:16:19,879
in American-made energy and we’ve got to
keep investing in the vehicles that run on


169
0:16:19,879 --> 0:16:23,829
it. That’s where our future is.


170
0:16:23,829 --> 0:16:27,36
And in order to continue this progress, we’re
going to have to make a choice. We’ve got


171
0:16:27,36 --> 0:16:33,69
to decide where our priorities are as a country.
And that’s up to all of you. And I’ll


172
0:16:33,69 --> 0:16:39,6
give you an example. Right now, $4 billion
of your tax dollars goes straight to the oil


173
0:16:39,6 --> 0:16:46,75
industry every year -- $4 billion in subsidies
that other companies don’t get. Now, keep


174
0:16:46,75 --> 0:16:51,92
in mind, these are some of the same companies
that are making record profits every time


175
0:16:51,92 --> 0:17:0,92
you fill up your gas tank. We’re giving
them extra billions of dollars on top of near-record


176
0:17:0,92 --> 0:17:6,98
profits that they’re already making. Anybody
think that’s a good idea?


177
0:17:6,98 --> 0:17:10,37
AUDIENCE No!


178
0:17:10,37 --> 0:17:13,2
THE PRESIDENT: Me, neither. (Laughter.) It
doesn’t make any sense. The American people


179
0:17:13,2 --> 0:17:16,72
have subsidized the oil industry long enough
-- they don’t need the subsidies. It’s


180
0:17:16,72 --> 0:17:22,1
time to end that taxpayer giveaway to an industry
that's never been more profitable, invest


181
0:17:22,1 --> 0:17:26,54
in clean energy that's never been more promising.
(Applause.)


182
0:17:26,54 --> 0:17:35,29
So I called on Congress, eliminate these subsidies
right away. There’s no excuse to wait any


183
0:17:35,29 --> 0:17:35,54
longer.


184
0:17:35,54 --> 0:17:36,27
AUDIENCE: That's right!


185
0:17:36,27 --> 0:17:40,45
THE PRESIDENT: And we should put every member
of Congress on record: They can stand up for


186
0:17:40,45 --> 0:17:45,37
the oil companies or they can stand up for
the American people and this new energy future.


187
0:17:45,37 --> 0:17:53,3
(Applause.) We can place our bets on the fuel
of the past, or we can place our bets on American


188
0:17:53,3 --> 0:17:58,22
know-how and American ingenuity and American
workers like the ones here at Daimler. (Applause.)


189
0:17:58,22 --> 0:18:3,61
That’s the choice we face. That’s what’s
at stake right now.


190
0:18:3,61 --> 0:18:12,48
So, in between shifts, get on the phone or
email or send a letter or tweet -- (laughter)


191
0:18:12,48 --> 0:18:17,46
-- your member of Congress; ask them where
they stand on this -- because it will make


192
0:18:17,46 --> 0:18:24,5
a difference. And you’ll know where I stand
on this. Let’s make sure our voices are


193
0:18:24,5 --> 0:18:34,18
heard. The next time you hear some politician
trotting out some 3-point plan for $2 gas


194
0:18:34,18 --> 0:18:37,39
-- (laughter) -- you let them know, we know
better.


195
0:18:37,39 --> 0:18:38,65
AUDIENCE: Yes!


196
0:18:38,65 --> 0:18:42,74
THE PRESIDENT: Tell them we’re tired of
hearing phony election-year promises that


197
0:18:42,74 --> 0:18:51,38
never come about. What we need is a serious,
sustained, all-of-the-above strategy for American-made


198
0:18:51,38 --> 0:18:59,16
energy, American-made efficiency, American
innovation, American fuel-efficient trucks,


199
0:18:59,16 --> 0:19:3,19
American fuel-efficient cars. We may not get
there in one term --


200
0:19:3,19 --> 0:19:5,67
AUDIENCE: Four more years! (Applause.)


201
0:19:5,67 --> 0:19:21,7
THE PRESIDENT: It's going to take us a while
to wean ourselves off of the old and grab


202
0:19:21,7 --> 0:19:30,74
the new. But we're going to meet this challenge
because we are Americans. Our destiny is not


203
0:19:30,74 --> 0:19:35,37
written for us; it is written by us. We decide
what that next chapter is going to be.


204
0:19:35,37 --> 0:19:36,5
AUDIENCE: Yes!


205
0:19:36,5 --> 0:19:41,35
THE PRESIDENT: And I'm confident, working
with folks like you, the outstanding working


206
0:19:41,35 --> 0:19:49,81
people of Mount Holly, of this plant, of North
Carolina, of states all across the country,


207
0:19:49,81 --> 0:19:55,54
we can pull together, and remind everybody
around the world just why it is that the United


208
0:19:55,54 --> 0:19:58,38
States of America is the greatest nation on
Earth.


209
0:19:58,38 --> 0:20:1,94
Thank you very much, everybody. God bless
you. God bless the United States of America.


210
0:20:1,94 --> 0:22:1,94
(Applause.)
