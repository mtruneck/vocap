1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:17,676



2
0:0:17,676 --> 0:0:21,59
SUROOSH ALVI: Well, Al Aqsa is
basically Hamas television.


3
0:0:21,59 --> 0:0:23,15
Who owns the channel?


4
0:0:23,15 --> 0:0:24,59
Is it independently owned?


5
0:0:24,59 --> 0:0:26,5
BAHAAUDDIN AL GHOUL: We belong
to the Palestinian


6
0:0:26,5 --> 0:0:28,61
rights, we say so.


7
0:0:28,61 --> 0:0:34,26
Just like the Israeli TVs belong
to Israel, and Al Aqsa


8
0:0:34,26 --> 0:0:35,69
TV belongs to Palestine.


9
0:0:35,69 --> 0:0:41,11
It's the first Palestinian
channel to produce resistance.


10
0:0:41,11 --> 0:0:45,79
The Palestinians have always
said we want our land.


11
0:0:45,79 --> 0:0:50,65
People have the right to defend
himself and to use


12
0:0:50,65 --> 0:0:53,98
resistance against the
occupation force.


13
0:0:53,98 --> 0:0:57,98
If you could give us a
well-targeted weapon that


14
0:0:57,98 --> 0:1:2,12
could only kill the soldiers
of the Israeli, the


15
0:1:2,12 --> 0:1:5,939
Palestinians wouldn't
use such ruckus.


16
0:1:5,939 --> 0:1:9,779



17
0:1:9,779 --> 0:1:13,37
SUROOSH ALVI: The last time I
came, in 2007, I met with an


18
0:1:13,37 --> 0:1:15,96
organization called Palestinian
Media Watch.


19
0:1:15,96 --> 0:1:19,3
They're Israeli, and they sit
and they just watch everything


20
0:1:19,3 --> 0:1:20,81
that you're making here.


21
0:1:20,81 --> 0:1:23,18
And they study it, and they
analyze it, and then they go


22
0:1:23,18 --> 0:1:26,305
to make presentations
to the US Congress.


23
0:1:26,305 --> 0:1:30,28
And they say look how radical
the people in Gaza are.


24
0:1:30,28 --> 0:1:33,3
They're making Mickey
Mouse with AK-47s.


25
0:1:33,3 --> 0:1:36,11
BAHAAUDDIN AL GHOUL: They also
say to their people that


26
0:1:36,11 --> 0:1:39,22
killing a Palestinian is good.


27
0:1:39,22 --> 0:1:43,89
So there's a different
way to see.


28
0:1:43,89 --> 0:1:47,75
If you look to the same video
on an Israeli channel, they


29
0:1:47,75 --> 0:1:50,98
tell their people that killing
Palestinians is a good thing.


30
0:1:50,98 --> 0:1:53,78
SUROOSH ALVI: Can you tell me
about some of the risks that


31
0:1:53,78 --> 0:1:56,61
are involved with working as
a reporter for Al Aqsa?


32
0:1:56,61 --> 0:2:1,23
BAHAAUDDIN AL GHOUL: Our office,
which is now renewed,


33
0:2:1,23 --> 0:2:5,75
has been targeted with
an F-16 bomb--


34
0:2:5,75 --> 0:2:7,54
totally demolished.


35
0:2:7,54 --> 0:2:11,2
Two of our cameramen's
been killed.


36
0:2:11,2 --> 0:2:11,77
[INAUDIBLE]


37
0:2:11,77 --> 0:2:14,92
who was murdered by
an Israeli rocket.


38
0:2:14,92 --> 0:2:18,93
Two of our correspondents have
lost some of their body.


39
0:2:18,93 --> 0:2:22,72
Our cameraman has lost his two
legs, and he shoot and shoot


40
0:2:22,72 --> 0:2:24,94
until he lost his legs.


41
0:2:24,94 --> 0:2:28,5
Made his legs cut, two legs.


42
0:2:28,5 --> 0:2:31,47
So this is an occupation.


43
0:2:31,47 --> 0:2:35,77
And the Palestinians
who resist are


44
0:2:35,77 --> 0:2:38,1
called freedom fighters.


45
0:2:38,1 --> 0:2:41,19
They would like to get
their homeland freed.


46
0:2:41,19 --> 0:2:44,582
If Isreal wants to stop,
they can stop.


47
0:2:44,582 --> 0:2:45,57
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello.


48
0:2:45,57 --> 0:2:46,82
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello.


49
0:2:46,82 --> 0:2:50,16



50
0:2:50,16 --> 0:2:52,33
FEMALE SPEAKER: The first
building was attacked at


51
0:2:52,33 --> 0:2:57,3
approximately 1:30 AM, it
was a media building.


52
0:2:57,3 --> 0:3:1,71
This media building had an
infrastructure of Hamas


53
0:3:1,71 --> 0:3:4,86
electronics communications
on the roof.


54
0:3:4,86 --> 0:5:4,86
