###12 Detail the difference between how we make decisions now
###16 as opposed to how decisions are arrived at
###19 in a Resource-Based Economy - Well, the decision making system now
###24 is mainly based upon different industries
###28 which feel that they have a good product
###30 so they advertise and convince people to buy that product.
###36 Whereas in the future, in a saner system
###40 we would design products not to wear out and break down
###44 to last as long as possible
###46 so that the responsibility of the service sector
###51 would not be overloaded.
###54 The longer materials last
###57 the less burdensome to society.
###60 Therefore, our major concern is not profit
###64 it's the well-being of human beings throughout the world.
###68 To the degree that we neglect people
###72 we hurt our own future.  For example
###75 if we or the United States controlled
###79 most of the Earth's resources
###82 we would produce anxiety in other countries
###85 for fear of running out of resources:
###88 arable land, water, etc.  And therefore, they might invade
###93 this country to try to get the necessary resources for survival.
###99 I don't think it's wise for a nation to defend itself
###104 or try to make sustainability available
###108 only in the area that they live
###110 because they would produce hatred and envy
###113 and try to control the resources of other countries
###117 so that we can enslave people or put them on minimum wage
###122 and get whatever we want produced
###125 for the self-centered reason of our nation.
###129 And we seek national advantage
###132 rather than global advantage.
###135 As long as we seek national advantage
###139 it may work for a while.  It may enhance the lifestyles
###143 or increase the productivity of goods and services
###147 but that's not of long duration. This is the only thing I worry about.
###152 Sustainability for separate nations is OK in the short run
###158 but in the long run it produces negative retroaction.
###162 So this is how we really work if you want to know.
###167 The best way to understand it
###170 was assuming that we found a planet similar to the Earth
###175 with lots of resources, unspoiled waters
###179 non-contaminated air;
###181 and brought a group of people together and ask:
###184 "What is it that people really need?"
###188 And then you list all the things that people really need.
###192 The next question is: "Can that planet
###196 provide for those needs?"
###198 And if it cannot, you have to base your needs
###201 on what the planet can provide.
###204 If the population is too large
###207 the planet cannot provide for that enlarged population.
###212 Therefore, the size of the population
###215 would be built and based upon the carrying capacity
###219 of that regional division or the planet's capacity
###224 to produce sustainable materials.
###228 Therefore, we cannot invite
###230 billions of people to live on the new planet
###233 if the planet cannot sustain them.
###235 So when I say "Decisions have to be arrived at"
###240 first you have to study the carrying capacity of a planet
###244 what it's capable of supporting.  Then you design your cities
###248 and population densities so that they correspond
###252 to the carrying capacity of the environment.
###256 That's what I mean when I say "People do not make decisions
###260 they arrive at them." And how do you decide
###264 how much oxygen to carry on a submarine?
###267 Well, that depends on the amount of people in a submarine
###270 and how long you wish to be submerged. That determines that.
###275 How do you know how much water to carry on the submarine?
###278 How do you know how much food to carry?
###281 How do you know how much electrical power?
###283 It depends on the performance you want of that submarine.
###287 Then you put in the proper electrical power
###290 for operating the submarine.
###293 You have to put in enough food and refrigeration equipment
###297 to feed the crew. If you don't provide for that
###301 the technology may work, but the crew won't.
###305 You have to not make decisions, you have to arrive at them.
###310 -That is a small portion of a talk about arriving at decisions.
###313 It's by survey and Scientific Method.
###317 And he covers some other things in there about population, laws
###322 negative retroactions of separate nations and national advantage
###327 and so forth. All of that lecture is posted
