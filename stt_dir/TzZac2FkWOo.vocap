###0 Travis Taylor: Now on Rocket City Rednecks.
###2 We're helping our troops by building
###4 an armor suit that protects the entire body.
###8 We'll find out if our armor suit
###9 can take the physical abuse.
###12 I can run a marathon in this thing.
###15 But can the guy wearing the suit take the abuse
###17 dished out by a real marine drill instructor?
###21 Bodette: You ain't got time to be tired.
###24 Travis Taylor: I'm Travis Taylor.
###26 I'm a rocket scientist in the space and
###27 defense industry here in my hometown of
###29 Huntsville, Alabama
###30 where my daddy helped build the rockets
###32 that sent us to the moon.
###34 Daddy: Have y'all been drinking
###35 rocket fuel again?
###36 Travis Taylor: Sometimes big science
###38 moves too slow for me.
###39 So come the weekend I round up
###41 my best friend Rog.
###42 Rog: Hey!
###43 Travis Taylor: My nephew Michael and
###45 my buddy Pete to tackle important
###46 problems with a little down-home ingenuity.
###50 Rog: Damn it, boy.
###55 Travis Taylor: Right on.
###56 Hey, is there any more beers in the cooler?
###60 Today we are doing a little shooting,
###61 but it's not just for fun.
###64 My big brother, Michael's Daddy
###67 he's in the Air Force and he tells all the time
###69 about this big armored jacket that
###71 he has to wear when he goes
###72 into combat situations.
###73 There has got to be better way.
###75 So we're doing some baseline testing of
###77 military issued body armor to see if we can
###80 come up with a lighter version that
###81 works just as good or better.
###84 Michael: My daddy wears one of these all the time
###85 so it be good to put something else out there
###88 as an option that could be better.
###90 Travis Taylor: Holy crap.
###91 Pete: I was really surprised at how
###93 well the vest stood up to gunfire.
###95 A typical military vest is sewn out of
###97 multiple layers of Kevlar, which is a synthetic woven
###101 fabric that is 5 times stronger than steel.
###104 Travis Taylor: Pull that plate out.
###105 Kevlar alone can stop certain ammunition.
###108 The vest also holds armor plates.
###110 And this piece right here.
###111 Pete: That's what, boron carbonate?
###113 Travis Taylor: That's boron carbonate or
###115 silicate carbonate look at that.
###116 They are small arms protection inserts that
###118 are made of hard ceramic materials and
###120 they offer additional protection.
###121 It weighs whatever just to cover their torso and
###124 then they have to carry their packs.
###125 That's a lot of weight to be walking around in.
###127 I got something in the back of the truck
###129 I want to show you all.
###130 I want to play around with this and
###131 let y'all see what it feels like to
###133 have to wear one of these things.
###135 I think for us to truly understand what
###139 these guys have to wear and do and put up with.
###142 The only thing to do is to run a mile in the
###144 shoes of the people who wear it.
###145 Daddy, I am gonna take 'em all around this way
###147 and up this hill you get in the truck
###149 and you follow us on out.
###151 Out that way and we are gonna do at least a mile.
###153 Rog: I don't want to do this,
###155 I'm no runner but it's for the troops
###157 so I'll give it a try.
###159 Travis Taylor: Come on.
###163 Daddy: Hey keep it going, doing good, doing good.
###167 Left, left, left, right, left.
###170 Travis Taylor: You ok Rog?
###171 Back in high school I couldn't out run
###173 Rog to save my life.
###175 Rog was one of the fastest at the 800-meter run and
###178 I would run about 10 or 20 seconds
###180 behind him at least.
###182 Stay with it, Rog.
###184 Rog: I'm through running!
###187 Travis Taylor: And now seeing how after only
###190 .4 miles he just falls over and off the side of the
###193 road and he is so winded he can't get along.
###196 I think he sees what his lifestyle has done to him.
###199 Daddy: Get in here before you have a heart attack.
###204 Michael: These suits are heavy and they're hot and
###206 they're awkward to wear and they're bulky because
###209 these plates are stiff so every time you move you
###211 feel 'em on your back and you can feel
###213 where they restrict you.
###214 Travis Taylor: What we got to do is
###216 figure out something better.
###217 They're good I mean it's the best state of
###219 art armor in the world, but it'd be great if
###220 we could do something even better.
###224 There are dozens of new materials and
###226 ultra tough polymers out there
###228 that the government hasn't tested yet.
###230 We could research these materials for them.
###232 And we are gonna do it lighter, faster,
###234 cheaper and we are gonna do it all in one weekend.
###237 I like to the cut the weight in half
###238 and keep the same protection.
###240 Daddy: Now, I don't know of anyone
###242 creating a full armor suit.
###245 That's a tall order.
###246 Travis Taylor: We want to make a full
###248 body armor suit that covers a soldier's
###250 torso, arms, legs and head.
###253 It's got to be bullet proof and blast proof
###255 and still be light and flexible enough to
###257 maneuver through a battlefield.
###259 Once we figure out the materials which you all
###261 need to go be gathering up some materials and
###262 go do some testing but you know got to make
###264 a vest out of that.
###265 So uh I think I'm gonna have to go recruit some
###267 help on that cause don't none of us how to sew.
###270 Daddy: I know as much about sewing
###271 as a hog does arithmetic.
###273 Travis won't do it, Michael and Pete
###275 not gonna do it, Rog sure ain't gonna do it.
###278 Travis Taylor: Guess what, momma!
###280 Well look you all gather up all the materials you
###282 can think of that might be useful and
###284 I'll see if mom can break her sewing machine out
###286 and help us figure out to make a vest
###287 out of this thing.
###288 Y'all, y'all go get with it.
###290 Michael: You go get with it.
###291 Mama: Show me what you got in mind.
###294 Travis Taylor: Well, we are gonna make a vest.
###296 We're starting with a vest the same size
###297 as the military vest.
###299 Our first challenge is to make half the weight
###301 and just as bullet proof.
###302 Now if we can pull that off,
###303 then we'll scale it up to a full suit.
###306 Rog: Get out of the way, Yerp.
###307 Quit calling them gals!
###309 Pete: We were looking around for materials in
###310 the neighborhood and we picked up a water tank
###312 from the neighbors farm it's made of
###314 high-density polyethylene.
###317 We also found a sheet of ultra high molecular
###319 weight polyethylene which is used for
###321 anything from fishing line to hip replacements.
###324 These should make great body armor plates.
###326 And then we picked up some Kevlar material
###328 from the local surplus store for
###329 Mrs. Taylor to sew the vest with.
###332 Travis Taylor: Hold up a minute,
###333 hold up a minute, hold up a minute.
###334 Hold up a minute;
###335 let me show you all something.
###337 Michael: Show us something.
###338 Rog: What do you got?
###339 Travis Taylor: Mom and I have been in there
###340 working on a template for what we got to have.
###342 This is what the vets is gonna look like;
###344 these are the hard pieces that we got to make.
###347 Go head and draw it up on a piece of
###348 plywood or something.
###349 Michael: Something to trace.
###350 Travis Taylor: 'Cause I got to get these back to
###352 momma and get her some fabric did you
###353 all find me some Kevlar fabric yet?
###354 Pete: Yes.
###355 Michael: Yes there is some out right over there.
###357 Travis Taylor: Hey lookie here.
###359 Pete: The boys came up with several things.
###361 The first thing is we got this UHMWPE
###364 Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
###367 Travis Taylor: Oh, yeah, yeah.
###368 Pete: So it's a lot more dense it's got
###369 a look more aero density.
###371 Travis Taylor: Yeah it's the same polymer but
###373 that stuff there has like thousands of atoms
###375 on the molecule chain and
###377 this one has like millions right?
###378 Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene
###381 is a polymer made up of very long chains
###384 of polyethylene molecules.
###386 The more molecules on the chain,
###388 the greater the impact resistance.
###390 This stuff has a molecular weight 15 times
###393 greater than regular polyethylene
###395 that makes it incredibly tough.
###397 Yeah this stuff should stop a .22 cold just by itself.
###401 While Momma sews the Kevlar vest together
###403 we cut our armor plate pieces.
###406 Michael and Rog and I were hanging out in
###408 the back of the truck and
###409 I looked at my bed liner on the truck.
###411 Look at this right here.
###413 And that reminded me that Line-X is one
###416 of the strongest materials that you can
###418 put on a bed liner of a truck and
###420 you dump rocks and all sorts of
###422 stuff in there and never bothers it.
###423 What if we sprayed that armor with Line-X?
###428 Michael: Uh they're tough.
###429 Rog: Their tougher on hobo stuff.
###431 Michael: It would sure make it rugged.
###432 Travis Taylor: It would make it rugged.
###433 Michael: You wouldn't never tear it,
###435 or scratch it or it would never come apart.
###437 Travis Taylor: A lot of folks take their
###438 trucks to the Line-X shop to have their
###440 bed sprayed for added protection.
###442 Line-X is made of a strong polyurethane plastic
###445 and it's so tough, the Pentagon building
###448 is even got parts sprayed with this
###449 stuff to protect it from bomb blasts.
###452 I think a coat or two would really help
###454 with our armor protection.
###455 You know Momma is about done with that
###457 vest in there, I am gonna go get it
###458 and get it sprayed.
###460 Rog: Shot gun.
###461 Michael: Road trip.
###461 Travis Taylor: No, no, no you two get
###464 back in there and you all, you all stay
###465 and work on that armor.
###467 Michael: Let's go.
###468 Travis Taylor: And the helmet and all that.
###469 I am gonna take Pete over.
###471 It's about time that me and
###472 Pete got to go on a road trip.
###474 We grabbed the vest that Momma sewed all
###475 the armor plates into and
###477 we took it over to get it sprayed.
###480 Safety glasses Pete.
###482 Pete: I'm suprised he has any buckets left.
###484 Travis Taylor: Check that out, look at that.
###485 Pete: It get's pulled right to those vents over there?
###487 Travis Taylor: Oh yeah, oh yeah,
###489 that's beautiful man.
###490 I think we're done.
###491 As soon as it cools off enough we can pick it up,
###492 we'll pick it up and we'll throw it in the truck.
###494 We'll shoot it, blow it up.
###497 Now it's time for our big test.
###499 Will this lighter vest hold up to combat
###501 conditions as well as the standard issue vest?
###504 We had the guys meet us at the gun range
###506 along with a buddy of ours.
###508 And Daddy you got your 9-millimeter
###509 and what else?
###511 Daddy: I got it.
###512 Travis Taylor: Look here, look here.
###514 A buddy of ours, Soupy, came up he's a vet;
###516 he actually wore these things over in Iraq.
###519 I wanted you to take a look at what we did and
###522 maybe give us some pointers on it and
###523 tell us whatever, this is our prototype
###525 we are about to blow it up,
###526 shoot at it do whatever we come up with.
###528 But I wanted you to see what you think about it.
###532 Soupy: Man, I'll tell you that,
###534 that's a whole lot lighter than
###535 what we actually wore.
###537 Travis Taylor: Yeah?
###538 Soupy: Yes, sir.
###539 The main thing is the flexibility.
###542 Travis Taylor: We're gonna work on that a
###544 little bit more too but this is the basis
###546 of what the material would be.
###547 So we wanted to use this as the one we shoot.
###549 Soupy: All right.
###550 Travis Taylor: Well Michael,
###552 let's go throw this thing on that dummy.
###553 You all get the guns ready.
###554 Daddy: I'm ready.
###555 Travis Taylor: We in good shape,
###556 move his arms down so Pete can shoot them off.
###558 Rog: He's got pretty eyes don't he?
###560 Travis Taylor: I'm scared to look into them.
###562 First Pete gave them the same treatment
###563 with his AK-47 that we gave the standard vest.
###569 Then it was Daddy's turn with his 9 millimeter.
###572 Daddy?
###574 Daddy: Yes son?
###575 Travis Taylor: I hate to ask but do you
###576 think you can hit that thing from here
###578 with your 9 millimeter?
###579 Daddy: We'll try it and see.
###580 Travis Taylor: See what you can do.
###581 Daddy: All right, ready?
###583 Going hot.
###590 That's it.
###591 Travis Taylor: Well let's go look.
###593 Rog: Yeah.
###595 Travis Taylor: Well it looks like you
###596 shot right through his hand right there.
###598 Daddy: Yeah.
###599 Travis Taylor: Look it went in right there.
###600 The question is did it come on
###601 out the other side?
###602 I can get right here and
###603 I can see if he got this one.
###605 Try to feel the bullet caught in;
###606 right there I got the bullet in my hand
###607 it's caught in the Kevlar.
###608 The plates stopped the bullets but there
###610 is a serious design flaw.
###612 The bullets went through the seams
###613 between the armor plates.
###615 We got to figure that out.
###616 I say we raise it up a notch.
###617 Now we know that the methods and
###619 materials we used on this first vest
###621 can stop bullets, which is great,
###623 but can it stop an IED?
###625 I rigged us up an IED this could be
###628 loud so be prepared, are we ready?
###631 3, 2, 1.
###633 <i> [explosion]</i>
###638 Travis Taylor: We've been creating lightweight
###639 flexible body armor for soldiers to use in combat.
###642 We already proved that our armored
###644 vest stops bullets.
###646 Now we are gonna see if it can
###648 stand up to explosives.
###649 This could be loud so be prepared.
###652 Pete: All right.
###653 Travis Taylor: Let's see how we do against
###654 an IED, are we ready?
###657 3, 2, 1.
###661 <i> [explosion]</i>
###668 Pete: Whoo!
###670 Michael: What happened?
###673 Travis Taylor: Just look at this thing.
###674 Michael: Let's go check him out.
###676 Daddy: Man, there is his poor old leg.
###679 I'll tell you, doin' a test like this makes you
###681 think about what our soldiers have to deal with.
###685 Travis Taylor: Look at this it didn't
###686 bother him up here.
###687 Michael: No.
###688 Travis Taylor: Didn't bother him at all up here.
###690 Soupy: But that proves that you know we still
###691 need something on the lower torso.
###693 Travis Taylor: Yeah that's right man.
###695 Soupy: I mean you can see what an IED does.
###697 Travis Taylor: Yeah it blows,
###698 that's why we have so many guys with
###699 their legs blown off right now.
###701 Soupy: Exactly.
###702 Travis Taylor: We got to make some armor that
###704 will do just that for the legs.
###706 This test was a success;
###707 we made a bullet proof, bombproof vest that's
###710 less than half the weight of the standard vest.
###713 The challenge here is to find a way to protect
###715 the limbs while maintaining flexibility
###718 and mobility in a full suit.
###720 We need to get back to the garage and
###722 make this thing so it will protect
###723 not just the torso, but also the legs.
###725 Poor old mannequin.
###729 So I went and recruited my mom some help.
###732 I got some my students from some my
###733 classes over at the local university to
###736 come over and help her out.
###737 Look at this right here,
###739 there's a bullet in there.
###740 Mama: Oh wow.
###741 Travis Taylor: It caught it just fine
###742 and it worked well.
###743 The interesting thing that we learned though
###745 mom is look here, these bullets came
###747 out in a straight line
###749 and that there is where the seam is.
###750 Mama: That's where the seams are.
###751 Travis Taylor: So we are gonna have to figure out
###753 a way to overlap that armor in there
###755 so that they wont come out on the seams.
###756 Maybe where they overlap more like
###758 fish scale or lizard scales or something.
###760 Hey, hey, look here!
###763 Rog: Whatcha got?
###765 Travis Taylor: Well I have been talking with mom and
###766 been thinking about how we wore this we are gonna
###769 have to do these pieces smaller and Line-X the
###772 individual pieces and then put them on the inside of
###774 the armor in order for it to be where
###776 I can move around in it.
###777 That's gonna be the key in stopping fragments
###779 and bullets and making it more mobile.
###781 Let's work on that.
###793 The suit is one thing,
###795 but what about head protection?
###796 The American military has been making helmets
###798 for a hundred years, but we want to make one
###800 with full-face protection.
###802 We used the design of a motorcycle helmet to
###805 protect more of the face.
###806 We added some foam pieces to make up the basic
###808 structure and then covered it all in Kevlar.
###811 And then we held it all together with fiberglass.
###815 Michael: I am gonna wash my hands so they
###816 don't like smell like these nasty gloves.
###817 Smell my fingers, Rog.
###819 Rog: Nope, nope.
###820 Travis Taylor: We got plenty more to do
###822 lets get on the next one.
###823 Pete: Heard that.
###824 Travis Taylor: Things are moving along.
###826 Momma and her student helpers Chris and
###827 Katie spent all day cutting and
###829 sewing on that yellow Kevlar fabric.
###834 Mama: And that will make, easy to make
###837 strips of pockets and then we do another layer
###839 and come back over here.
###841 Travis Taylor: Then they sewed them into
###842 pocket packs that fit perfectly in the vest.
###844 I decided that we needed to add armor plates
###847 to the outside of the legs and
###848 arms just like a catcher's shin guard.
###851 That's gonna have to be tightened up.
###855 So these, I need to put a strap on it
###857 for me Michael.
###858 Just maybe uh cut 'em, drill out a slot.
###861 Michael: Use a Velcro strap yeah.
###862 Travis Taylor: Yeah ok.
###864 This time around we only sprayed the
###866 armor plates with the Line-X
###868 to make the whole suit more flexible.
###870 Mama: The last step is cover all
###872 that itchy Kevlar with cotton fabric.
###874 I hope Travis likes orange cause that's all I got.
###878 Travis Taylor: We've got to finish these
###879 exterior armor plates,
###880 which means dinner in the garage again.
###884 Tomorrow we do a full mobility test on the suit.
###890 Everybody worked really hard.
###891 Mom and students worked their butts off;
###894 we worked really hard cutting all the
###896 plates up getting everything all together.
###899 Here's the suit.
###902 Rog: Tear it up, Mule.
###903 Travis Taylor: All this is Kevlar.
###905 The inner shirt and the vest with the
###908 armor plates in it, it's ready to go;
###911 total weight, 39 lbs.
###915 Rog: That thing looks like bulky as hell.
###917 He ain't gonna be able to even move in
###919 that thing much less run across
###920 a battlefield getting shot at.
###923 Travis Taylor: This thing might look kind
###924 of goofy in prototype stage,
###926 but the concept is what's important.
###928 It's got to save lives.
###929 So I decided the best place to test a
###931 military armor suit was the local playground.
###937 Man, I believe its getting warm up in here.
###939 Michael: Yeah, it's getting hot.
###940 Travis Taylor: A kid's playground is a
###942 great place for a mobility test.
###943 It's got a challenging terrain,
###945 sand and lots of obstacles to get through.
###950 Michael: Really, a playground?
###952 Uncle Travis doesn't know it yet,
###954 but after this I'm gonna set him with
###955 something a little more challenging.
###960 Daddy: This playground test is simple.
###962 Can Travis move enough in this thing
###964 to get through every obstacle without stopping?
###966 On 3, you ready?
###968 Travis Taylor: Mm-hmm.
###968 Daddy: 3, 2, 1.
###970 Travis Taylor: Wait a minute you just said 3.
###972 Rog: You should have went.
###973 Michel: Go.
###975 Rog: Watch them kids.
###978 Daddy: It was just like the pied piper every kid
###980 on that playground got right behind him and
###983 tried to emulate what he was doing,
###986 it was funny.
###989 Rog: Stay with it, Mule.
###990 Travis Taylor: Turns out it's not so easy
###992 to do monkey bars in an armor suit.
###1000 Pete: Come on, technique.
###1003 Travis: [sighs].
###1004 Rog: How bad is it, Mule?
###1007 Travis Taylor: That was a lot harder than
###1008 I thought but this proves the suit works
###1011 and it's flexible enough to tackle
###1012 anything on this playground.
###1014 And uh Michael must have thought that was silly.
###1016 Michael: How are we gonna test anything
###1017 to military specs on a playground?
###1019 You know if he was running through this
###1021 and being chased by a bunch of 7 year old
###1022 kids that's not gonna get it;
###1024 that shows you right there that is not gonna get it.
###1026 So I call in my buddy Bodette who
###1027 is a retired Marine.
###1029 He is gonna put Uncle Travis through
###1030 a real training course.
###1035 Travis Taylor: He walks like a Marine.
###1036 Michael: Yeah he does.
###1037 Bodette: Hey uh, explain something to
###1039 me real quick you really think that
###1041 playing on a little kiddie
###1042 playground is gonna simulate you in anyway
###1043 shape or form in any type of combat situation?
###1046 Travis Taylor: Uh.
###1047 Bodette: Absolutely not, it ain't gonna happen!
###1048 The playground was stupid.
###1051 Well I got news for you if you cannot shoot,
###1053 move and communicate wearing that it's
###1055 absolutely useless to me.
###1056 I got a real test for you.
###1058 Michael: Its funny to me to get ready to
###1059 see what old Bodette is gonna put him through.
###1066 Travis Taylor: We're making a lightweight armor suit
###1069 and a retired Marine Corps Drill Instructor
###1071 is gonna put me through the ringer.
###1073 Bodette: What we are gonna do here today gentlemen,
###1075 is I am gonna put Travis through a
###1076 civilian version of a combat fitness test.
###1079 It's simulating him being able to overcome
###1081 obstacles in a combat situation
###1084 while wearing his gear.
###1085 Daddy: I am thinking now this is gonna be
###1086 tough on Travis you know.
###1088 Bodette: I need you Michael to go over there
###1090 and put that flight jacket on and lay down.
###1091 Michael: All right.
###1092 Bodette: You're gonna be a wounded warrior.
###1093 Michael: All right.
###1094 Bodette: You go do that right now we
###1095 are getting ready to start.
###1096 Any type of protective gear that you wear
###1098 you cannot really give up mobility.
###1099 If you can't shoot, move and communicate with the
###1101 body armor then it's absolutely useless.
###1104 Are you ready?
###1105 Travis Taylor: Ready as I'll ever be.
###1106 Bodette: Go!
###1107 Pete: Come on, Travis.
###1109 Bodette: All right, Travis, drop right now.
###1111 Drop right now and right now give me
###1112 5 push ups hurry up!
###1112 1, 2!
###1114 Travis Taylor: When Bodette said go,
###1115 I thought I was just simply running over to
###1118 a log to cross it but somewhere in the middle
###1119 he stopped me and had me do a bunch of push ups.
###1121 Bodette: 5.
###1122 Get up, hurry up, hurry, get up.
###1123 Rog: Get up, mule!
###1124 Bodette: Hurry up, come on we ain't got
###1125 all day now hurry up.
###1127 Rog: This sucks.
###1128 I am glad I ain't doing that crap.
###1129 Bodette: Go, go, go!
###1131 Rog: Go mule!
###1132 Michel: Look at him go.
###1133 Travis Taylor: By then I was getting winded
###1135 and then we come to these wires that
###1136 I had to balance across.
###1137 Bodette: You ain't have all day;
###1138 people are shooting at you right now.
###1140 People are depending on you, you got to move,
###1141 you got to move, you ain't got time.
###1143 Keep going, keep going!
###1145 Your buddies need you right now.
###1147 They're depending on you right now!
###1149 You need to hurry up, go!
###1150 That's it.
###1152 Rog: Arch your back.
###1153 Bodette: Grab that rope.
###1154 I ain't grabbing it for ya!
###1158 Rog: He ain't never gonna make it.
###1161 Bodette: Grab it.
###1162 That's right, that's right good job.
###1163 Rog: Stay with it mule.
###1165 Bodette: Come on hurry up,
###1166 you got people shooting at you.
###1167 You ain't got time to be tired right now.
###1168 Go ahead and grab that log right there,
###1169 press it above your head 5 times.
###1171 Travis Taylor: Then I had to pick up a log,
###1172 I wasn't expecting that.
###1174 Bodette: 1, keep going, 2, 3.
###1178 Pete: Yeah!
###1179 Bodette: 4, 5, good job,
###1180 put 'em down now go over there.
###1181 Get over there and run over there.
###1182 Now let's go Travis,
###1183 you are gonna jump over all these tables.
###1185 Travis Taylor: Ahh!
###1186 Bodette: Jump over 'em.
###1187 Travis Taylor: I had to go and jump over these tables
###1188 and I was getting really winded at that point.
###1190 Bodette: There's gonna be a lot of obstacles
###1191 in combat you are gonna have a lot of gear on you,
###1193 people are depending on you.
###1194 You can do this.
###1195 That's right.
###1196 Keep going, keep going.
###1197 Rog: Go, mule.
###1198 Bodette: Keep going.
###1200 Go over here, here just go right over here,
###1200 crawl underneath this thing low crawl.
###1202 You got to be low, you got to be fast.
###1203 You got a low crawl you got to be fast.
###1205 Daddy: And I figured well he'll get that
###1206 suit all tangled up in it we'll be out there
###1208 cutting him out of it.
###1209 Bodette: Right about now you got machine gunfire
###1211 breaking over your body right now you
###1213 got to be low.
###1214 You got to hurry up and get there.
###1215 Rog: Go mule.
###1216 Bodette: Fire, go get it.
###1217 Pete: Stay low, brother.
###1218 Bodette: We ain't got time;
###1219 you ain't got time to be tired.
###1220 Rog: Stay with it, mule.
###1221 Bodette: Let's go, hurry up, let's go,
###1222 hurry up get on up out of there right now!
###1223 Hurry up, get up and hurry up!
###1225 Get on those tires right now!
###1226 Daddy: But he made it through that thing.
###1227 Bodette: This ain't nothin'.
###1228 This ain't nothin' your buddies need you.
###1230 Pete: Come on buddy.
###1231 Bodette: Your buddies need you right now.
###1233 Yup, just like that, just like that.
###1236 Travis Taylor: And then run through a bunch of
###1237 tires that was the hardest part the tires
###1239 cause I was already dead.
###1241 Rog: Oh, man.
###1242 Bodette: Just like that, just like that,
###1243 just like that.
###1245 Let's go!
###1246 That's all right.
###1247 Let's go, let's go!
###1248 Right now people are shooting at you.
###1250 You got buddy he is laying down right over
###1251 he's got a 762 round right in
###1253 his chest let's go.
###1254 Hurry up, go pick him up!
###1258 This ain't nothin, this ain't nothin'.
###1259 Rog: Stay with it.
###1261 Travis Taylor: Then at the end of all that
###1262 he's got Michael laying over there as
###1264 a wounded warrior and I had to
###1266 drag him probably 20 or 30 feet.
###1268 Bodette: Let's go!
###1269 Rog: Get him, mule.
###1270 Pull him, mule!
###1271 Bodette: Little bit farther,
###1272 little bit farther, little bit farther,
###1273 little bit farther, hurry up!
###1274 Rog: Bring him on home.
###1275 Bodette: There you go, there you go!
###1276 All right, you're done.
###1277 Good job.
###1278 Rog: Come on, bubba.
###1280 Bodette: Good job.
###1281 Pete: All right, man, all right.
###1283 Rog: Good job, bubba.
###1284 You need some air.
###1284 Put them arms up, get them arms up.
###1286 Travis Taylor: And at that point I was
###1287 just ready to throw up.
###1288 Michael: Uncle Travis did pretty good that
###1289 was a tough obstacle course and
###1290 Bodette didn't take it easy on him.
###1292 Travis Taylor: Take my helmet off.
###1293 Pete: Take your helmet off?
###1295 Bodette: Let me tell you something.
###1296 That was a great job.
###1298 One of the things that, that either makes you or
###1300 breaks you in combat isn't always your gear its your
###1302 intestinal fortitude and that's exactly
###1305 what you had right there.
###1306 That's exactly what you showed me.
###1307 Travis Taylor: One of the things I learned
###1308 a lot was uh was something about myself.
###1310 That I believe I could push through some things
###1313 that I didn't think I could before and,
###1315 and had it not been for Bill Bodette
###1317 I probably wouldn't have done that.
###1319 Travis Taylor: You know what?
###1320 I believe with a little bit of training I could
###1322 run a marathon in this thing.
###1325 So I did run a marathon in this suit.
###1335 26.2 miles in a 40-pound suit;
###1339 it took me over 6 hours.
###1341 Like I said, I'm a science geek from
###1342 North Alabama and I did this.
###1344 Thank you very much, man.
###1345 Marine: Congratulations.
###1346 Travis Taylor: Think what a young strappin'
###1347 marine could do.
