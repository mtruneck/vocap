###42 HAMILTON MORRIS: Hello.
###43 I'm Hamilton Morris.
###44 We're currently boating through flooded forests on our
###50 way to meet the Mayoruna Indians, a formerly
###55 cannibalistic tribe who use a strange frog derived
###61 drug they call sapo.
###63 They use it to give themselves energy before hunting.
###66 They use it to abort pregnancies by rubbing these
###70 womens' vaginas with it.
###72 This venom contains an opioid peptide that's 100 times
###78 stronger than morphine.
###80 And some people say that it's psychedelic.
###82 It doesn't activity any of the psychedelic receptors
###85 are far as I know.
###87 But there's also a lot about the venom we don't know.
###89 
###92 The venom produces some kind of a strange
###96 effect to make you vomit.
###97 And then supposedly you spending the next eight hours
###101 in some kind of a daze.
###105 And wake up feeling fantastic the next day.
###109 
###112 And they're going to ritualistically burn me and
###116 rub the frog venom into my wounds.
###118 And then it's going to produce some sort of a strange effect.
###121 I'm not exactly sure what it's going to do.
###124 But we'll find out.

###147 ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN) Thank you for flying with
###149 [INAUDIBLE].
###150 
###158 HAMILTON MORRIS: I have arrived in Tabatinga after
###160 days of traveling.
###161 It's an impossibly humid rainforest city built by drug
###165 traffickers and sandwiched between the borders of
###167 Colombia and Peru.
###168 
###179 I feel like I'm being gang banged by vegetation.
###182 Every visible surface is coated with growing plants.
###185 The streets are overrun with motorcycles,
###187 scooters, and mopeds.
###189 I can feel that the jungle is near.
###193 I go to the dock where the journey will begin and meet
###196 our guide, Juan.
###198 Before we exchange a word, he looked at my long hair and
###201 started laughing hysterically.
###202 He said the Mayoruna Indians are going
###204 to think I'm a woman.
###206 They're going to kidnap me as a wife.
###208 Then he repeated the joke a million times during the
###210 course of our day.
###212 
###214 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###217 HAMILTON MORRIS: I board a boat, which is a 30-foot long
###219 canoe with a wicker awning in the middle.
###221 
###224 I meet the other crew member, a man introduced as the
###227 captain who will run the boat's small motor.
###230 
###244 We make a quick stop to pick up a giant block of filthy
###248 frozen river water.
###249 
###258 The ice block is dragged out of the freezer through a heap
###261 of bloody gutted catfish.
###262 
###267 The captain then proceeds to smash up the ice blocks with
###270 the rusty machete and throw the chunks into a couple of
###273 styrofoam coolers which will hold our
###275 minuscule food supply.
###277 Juan says the ice will last six days, but that seems
###280 totally impossible.
###281 
###286 We're on the Amazon River right now.
###290 We're still on the border of Peru, Brazil, and Colombia
###296 with Columbia this way, Brazil this way, and Peru that way.
###303 Because of it's proximity to Colombia and Peru, Tabatinga
###306 has become one of the main entry points for cocaine
###309 traffickers into Brazil.
###311 I'm told the chance of us encountering cocaine being
###314 shuttled around is not too low.
###316 
###321 The rainy season is when the Amazon River swells over the
###324 land and life hemorrhages out of everything in sight.
###328 There are trees growing on trees, ants crawling on ants,
###331 and penis fish swimming up the urethra of other penis fish.
###334 It's exhausting to watch.
###337 In order to save time, we take a detour
###339 through the flooded jungle.
###340 
###352 Our crew consists of Juan in front with the machete, the
###357 captain in the back motoring us around, and Alex who is in
###363 charge of security should we run into any hostile drug
###369 traffickers.
###370 But that's sort of something that hasn't been discussed in
###374 too much detail at this point, I guess.
###378 It's going to be three days up river.
###381 Each night we're going to stay on the side of the river in
###385 some sort of a shack.
###387 And then we find the Mayoruna.
###389 
###415 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###416 
###424 HAMILTON MORRIS: The sun sets and we dock at the home of
###426 some strangers.
###428 The river surrounds their home and
###429 reaches up to their doorstep.
###431 Apparently, families living on the river are obliged to take
###434 in travelers.
###436 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###437 
###449 HAMILTON MORRIS: Here we are on the banks
###451 of the Javari River.
###453 This is where we're going to be spending the night tonight.
###459 These are our hammocks, complete with
###463 mosquito-proof netting.
###464 
###467 There's a very nice view of the river.
###470 
###482 Here is the bathroom.
###483 It consists of a board with two holes cut in it.
###488 I'm not exactly even sure what to do with
###490 it or what it means.
###492 I just peed into the hole that had the most
###496 pee surrounding it.
###498 This seems like a pretty authentic Amazon experience.
###501 
###505 I like this dog.
###506 
###508 I think he likes me.
###511 Night comes and our hosts cook us a chicken meal.
###515 I'm ready to eat some chicken, get some fitful sleep, and
###518 then spend another day on the boat.
###520 
###525 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###526 
###538 HAMILTON MORRIS: There's definitely
###539 mosquitoes inside my tent.
###542 I can, like, hear them buzzing next to my
###544 face as I was sleeping.
###546 But it was too dark to do anything.
###548 
###595 It's ten in the morning right now.
###597 Last night we stayed at someone's house.
###599 And there was a big debate about whether it was OK to
###603 bathe because the bathing water was right next to the
###607 peeing and shitting water.
###608 And there really didn't even seem to be
###612 any reason to bathe.
###613 Because it's only the second day.
###615 I didn't feel the need.
###617 But a lot of other people in our crew decided that it was
###620 hot and they would sleep better after they
###623 washed their hair.
###625 
###659 Around 11:00 in the morning we stop for a bite to eat.
###663 Alex stabs open a can of winners with a giant chrome
###666 hunting knife.
###668 I eat a few.
###668 And they taste like wet toilet paper.
###670 
###673 Every time we stop for someone to pee, flocks of majestic
###677 yellow butterflies swarm around us.
###680 I'm going to go pee into this flock of
###683 butterflies right now.
###684 
###704 Here we are in another flooded forest region.
###708 It's pretty spectacular actually.
###711 We're just floating on the tree tops.
###714 We're floating halfway up a forest.
###718 The river is, like, S-shaped.
###721 But since it's the rainy season, we're able to cut
###723 through sections of forest that have flooded.
###726 And this isn't normally a river.
###728 It's only a river six months of the year,
###731 or maybe even less.
###733 But we're just floating by the top of a tree.
###735 It's, like, very strange.
###738 
###755 Around noon I have to shit off the side of the boat while
###758 everyone films me, not fun.
###763 I was definitely poisoned many times over by last night's
###766 chicken dinner.
###768 
###771 I sincerely fear that I may shit my only pair of pants.
###774 
###781 Fantastic.
###782 
###801 I recently learned that we were on
###802 this expedition illegally.
###804 FUNAI, the Brazilian agency dedicated to indian affairs,
###808 patrols these waters looking for unlicensed groups like
###811 ours who are trying to contact the Indians.
###814 Juan also tells me the Amazon is full of creatures
###817 scientists know nothing about.
###819 Once while deep in the jungle, he encountered a fur covered
###823 beast with only one eye.
###825 Him and the beast exchanged a glance.
###827 And as a result, Juan suffered a five month long fever.
###832 I had been smoking JWH-018-laced cigarettes and
###836 was too high to be skeptical.
###838 So instead, I opted for extreme fear.
###841 
###844 The sight of FUNAI will be of plenty to worry about.
###846 There's ramped malaria, and hepatitis epidemics.
###849 The waters are infested with piranhas, snakes, and Candiru
###852 penis fish, and the air is filled with biting insects.
###855 
###859 The homes along the river are becoming
###861 further and further apart.
###862 And we dock early today with a small family
###864 living on the shore.
###867 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###869 
###874 HAMILTON MORRIS: The air is vibrating with swarms of
###877 mosquitoes.
###878 I've never seen anything like this in my life.
###881 The insects are impossibly bloodthirsty and they remove a
###885 plug of flesh when they bite.
###887 In minutes my hands are covered with
###889 bleeding, swollen sores.

###938 HAMILTON MORRIS: I'm just hoping that I don't get bitten
###942 too terribly tonight.
###944 And that the food doesn't poison me too severely.

###962 
###977 HAMILTON MORRIS: Night falls and the incredible number of
###979 bugs discourages me from bathing once again.
###984 I lay in my hammock while mosquitoes
###986 squeal past my ears.
###987 The mosquito net and bug spray are only a
###989 formality at this point.
###990 There is no escape.
###992 
###1004 I wake up totally massacred by bugs.
###1007 It would be much easier to describe where I don't have
###1010 mosquito bites--
###1011 my hair, fingernails, asshole, and the inside of my mouth.
###1015 
###1023 We take a Polaroid of our host's daughter, give it to
###1027 her, and get out of there.
###1028 
###1033 Today, we are scheduled to arrived at the Mayoruna
###1035 village, the ancient village of the frog.
###1038 
###1045 Day three, I still haven't bathed.
###1047 But I think that's going to change soon because I want to
###1051 look my best for the Mayoruna.
###1054 I have mosquito bites on every square inch of my body.
###1059 My neck is just like a necklace of searing pain.
###1065 Well, I don't even know how they were able
###1066 to target my neck.
###1068 
###1071 Well, I'm miserable right now.
###1073 
###1079 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1082 HAMILTON MORRIS: It's been four days since I've bathed--
###1086 four incredibly sweaty days.
###1090 [SIGHS]
###1095 HAMILTON MORRIS: It's been a long time since I've
###1096 taken off my pants.
###1098 
###1103 Oh, it's very cool.
###1106 OK.
###1108 Oh, it's actually ice cold, ice cold.
###1112 
###1128 MALE SPEAKER: Help him, [INAUDIBLE].
###1129 
###1161 HAMILTON MORRIS: We see the Mayoruna around midday.
###1163 They live on top of an orange cliff that juts straight out
###1166 of the river.
###1168 Children peer over the edge at us and then run to our boat to
###1171 carry our bags up the cliff.
###1172 
###1180 The clay crumbles under my feet.
###1182 If I fall, I'm three days from the nearest hospital.
###1187 Oh.
###1188 
###1191 So it's actually very refreshing to be here although
###1195 it's extremely hot.
###1198 The Mayoruna village is a collection of huts spread
###1200 across a large dusty clearing.
###1202 The insects are prehistoric.
###1205 [SOUND OF BUGS SWARMING]
###1219 HAMILTON MORRIS: As of now, the plan is to go out tonight
###1222 and catch the frog.
###1223 And then in the morning after the frog has been caught we'll
###1227 harvest the secretions and burn me and rub
###1231 them into my wounds.
###1233 
###1241 [GROWLING]
###1243 HAMILTON MORRIS: We walk into the hut of our host, a man
###1245 named Petro.
###1247 His face is covered in tattoos he gave himself with a tree
###1250 thorn needle and black fungus ink.
###1253 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1258 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1261 HAMILTON MORRIS: Juan asks Petro if he
###1263 thinks I'm a woman.
###1264 Petro says no.
###1266 Juan looks defeated.
###1267 
###1272 This is the stick.
###1275 You can actually see some dried sapo.
###1278 
###1282 That's a moldy bread type smell definitely.

###1311 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1312 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1313 
###1340 HAMILTON MORRIS: The chief's son takes me to his pharmacy,
###1342 which is a hut stockpiled with a modest supply of
###1345 antibiotics.
###1346 Ibuprofen, aspirin, neo ampicillin.
###1351 I think it's very good.
###1353 It makes me feel like if I come close to death after my
###1356 sapo administration, they will be able to slap me with some
###1364 ampicillin.
###1365 It's just nice to see people on top of medicine.
###1370 It's good.
###1371 [SIGHS]
###1374 HAMILTON MORRIS: I could go for some ice cold
###1376 lemonade right now.
###1377 
###1382 Here we are outside waiting for the frog to sing.
###1387 Even though it's the rainy season, it
###1389 hasn't rained in days.
###1390 And usually the frog doesn't make any
###1392 sounds unless it's wet.
###1394 So we're just waiting.
###1396 It might be hours and hours and hours before it makes any
###1399 sound at all.
###1400 But right now I'd like to just have an ice cream cone.
###1403 And maybe a cool glass of lemonade.
###1411 [SOUNDS OF AMAZON]
###1419 HAMILTON MORRIS: A little bit before dawn Petro hears the
###1421 song and calls back to the sapo imitating it's bark.
###1425 [MAKING BARKING SOUNDS]
###1428 HAMILTON MORRIS: He runs out of the hut, into the jungle,
###1430 and out of sight.
###1431 He returns half an hour later empty handed.
###1433 
###1436 It's 5:20 in the morning right now.
###1439 They just came back out of the woods and said that they
###1441 didn't hear it after all.
###1442 If it rains then the frog will sing and
###1445 we'll go into the woods.
###1446 But until then, I will return to my hammock and continue
###1450 waiting and scratching my bites.
###1455
