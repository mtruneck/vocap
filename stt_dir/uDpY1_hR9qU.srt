0:0:0,929 --> 0:0:2,72
OMAR ERLINGSSON: My
name's Omar Erlingsson.


3
0:0:2,72 --> 0:0:5,9
I'm in infrastructure security.


4
0:0:5,9 --> 0:0:10,16
I'm here to present the speaker
for today's special talk


5
0:0:10,16 --> 0:0:12,76
with the Authors
at Google series.


6
0:0:12,76 --> 0:0:15,93
So our speaker is
Gudrun Johnsen,


7
0:0:15,93 --> 0:0:19,42
who is a statistician and
economist from University


8
0:0:19,42 --> 0:0:24,79
of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and she
has worked for the Icelandic


9
0:0:24,79 --> 0:0:27,5
Parliamentary Special
Investigation Commission


10
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:31,226
on investigating the causes
of the economic collapse that


11
0:0:31,226 --> 0:0:33,664
happened in Iceland in 2008.


12
0:0:33,664 --> 0:0:37,8
So for me, it's quite
a personal subject.


13
0:0:37,8 --> 0:0:39,1
I'm originally from Iceland.


14
0:0:39,1 --> 0:0:42,67
My family and I moved
there in 2007 from here


15
0:0:42,67 --> 0:0:45,8
in Silicon Valley, where
I've been working until then.


16
0:0:45,8 --> 0:0:49,31
And on a trip back,
one of my colleagues


17
0:0:49,31 --> 0:0:52,42
asked me about what
were the underpinnings


18
0:0:52,42 --> 0:0:56,762
of the Icelandic
economy, and I knew


19
0:0:56,762 --> 0:0:57,97
that there was a lot of fish.


20
0:0:57,97 --> 0:1:0,11
That's what had been there
when I was growing up,


21
0:1:0,11 --> 0:1:1,945
and I knew that there
was a lot of banking,


22
0:1:1,945 --> 0:1:4,209
and I didn't exactly know what.


23
0:1:4,209 --> 0:1:7,31
There was some financing,
banking, stocks,


24
0:1:7,31 --> 0:1:12,73
and so on, and very
soon after that,


25
0:1:12,73 --> 0:1:16,25
it all came down with a bang.


26
0:1:16,25 --> 0:1:19,89
95% of the market value
of the stock market


27
0:1:19,89 --> 0:1:21,574
vanished overnight.


28
0:1:21,574 --> 0:1:26,6
Three of the six-largest
bankruptcies in world history


29
0:1:26,6 --> 0:1:33,61
are Icelandic banks, so
quite a large turn of events.


30
0:1:33,61 --> 0:1:35,77
As it turned out,
what really happened


31
0:1:35,77 --> 0:1:41,53
behind all of this, and this
great, rapid rise in the banks,


32
0:1:41,53 --> 0:1:44,186
seems to be all kinds of
different shenanigans.


33
0:1:44,186 --> 0:1:48,22
And so Gudrun is here to tell us
about those shenanigans, which,


34
0:1:48,22 --> 0:1:50,9
because Iceland is
relatively small,


35
0:1:50,9 --> 0:1:52,31
and because of this
completely unprecedented


36
0:1:52,31 --> 0:1:56,74
special commission set up by the
Parliament, which had basically


37
0:1:56,74 --> 0:1:59,83
total powers of
investigative authority,


38
0:1:59,83 --> 0:2:2,925
able to see all data
everywhere, with no exceptions,


39
0:2:2,925 --> 0:2:5,31
we actually know
what happened there.


40
0:2:5,31 --> 0:2:10,289
But I think in a greater
context, most of us


41
0:2:10,289 --> 0:2:12,54
had just moved to
Iceland, and there's


42
0:2:12,54 --> 0:2:16,35
a lot of stuff that's
going on in world finance


43
0:2:16,35 --> 0:2:18,779
and so on that is quite
reminiscent of the shenanigans


44
0:2:18,779 --> 0:2:21,32
that were happening there a few
years ago, and I don't think,


45
0:2:21,32 --> 0:2:23,24
fundamentally, very
much has changed.


46
0:2:23,24 --> 0:2:26,55
So anyway, with those words,
I will give the word over


47
0:2:26,55 --> 0:2:27,39
to Gudrun.


48
0:2:27,39 --> 0:2:28,723
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Thank you, Omar.


49
0:2:28,723 --> 0:2:30,909
[APPLAUSE]


50
0:2:30,909 --> 0:2:33,2
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Thank you so
much, and a special thanks


51
0:2:33,2 --> 0:2:37,31
to Omar for inviting me here
and organizing this event.


52
0:2:37,31 --> 0:2:41,71
It's a great opportunity
for me to be here with you.


53
0:2:41,71 --> 0:2:45,2
I have been giving this
talk mostly at financial


54
0:2:45,2 --> 0:2:47,36
institutions and
government agencies,


55
0:2:47,36 --> 0:2:50,83
but I wrote this book, "Bringing
Down the Banking System,"


56
0:2:50,83 --> 0:2:55,88
as a wrapping up this 2,400-page
report that we issued that


57
0:2:55,88 --> 0:3:1,16
nobody read into manageable
size of 200 pages,


58
0:3:1,16 --> 0:3:6,93
but I wrote it for
non-financiers, let's say,


59
0:3:6,93 --> 0:3:8,46
if there's such a word.


60
0:3:8,46 --> 0:3:14,27
So it's great to finally be in
front of my targeted audience.


61
0:3:14,27 --> 0:3:21,69
Now, as Omar mentioned briefly,
97% of the Icelandic banking


62
0:3:21,69 --> 0:3:26,89
sector collapsed
in October 2008,


63
0:3:26,89 --> 0:3:30,98
and before we entered
into the investigation


64
0:3:30,98 --> 0:3:33,2
of the Special
Investigation Commission,


65
0:3:33,2 --> 0:3:35,43
where I was actually
the first employee


66
0:3:35,43 --> 0:3:39,8
to be hired by the Commission--
so I was there from day one


67
0:3:39,8 --> 0:3:44,3
until the minute it
was published in 2012--


68
0:3:44,3 --> 0:3:48,7
we sort of had an idea
why this happened.


69
0:3:48,7 --> 0:3:52,4
But obviously, that wasn't
enough for the Icelandic public


70
0:3:52,4 --> 0:3:56,36
to be told that that was
a result of a rapid growth


71
0:3:56,36 --> 0:4:1,9
of credit, and size of the
banking balance sheets to GDP,


72
0:4:1,9 --> 0:4:3,33
and inadequate
financial supervision.


73
0:4:3,33 --> 0:4:6,2
I mean, that's the
short, elevator story,


74
0:4:6,2 --> 0:4:10,22
but we needed to tell them
how exactly this is possible,


75
0:4:10,22 --> 0:4:14,0
and how do you do this--
expanding your banking


76
0:4:14,0 --> 0:4:18,899
sector from being about
1 times GDP to 10 times


77
0:4:18,899 --> 0:4:22,21
GDP at the peak?


78
0:4:22,21 --> 0:4:27,49
We also needed to tell them why
would you ever want to do this,


79
0:4:27,49 --> 0:4:34,67
given that this is a really
risky strategy, so why would


80
0:4:34,67 --> 0:4:36,53
you ever want to do this?


81
0:4:36,53 --> 0:4:41,47
The third question we had
to answer was why on earth


82
0:4:41,47 --> 0:4:44,55
didn't anybody stop
this development?


83
0:4:44,55 --> 0:4:49,2
And finally, in my book,
I try to bring forward


84
0:4:49,2 --> 0:4:51,84
to the rest of the
financial world


85
0:4:51,84 --> 0:4:55,65
what we can learn
from this calamity.


86
0:4:55,65 --> 0:4:59,22
Now, I will ask you to
jot down your questions.


87
0:4:59,22 --> 0:5:2,75
We're going to save the best
for last-- your questions.


88
0:5:2,75 --> 0:5:4,37
It's quite a lot of material.


89
0:5:4,37 --> 0:5:8,43
It demands quite a
bit from the audience,


90
0:5:8,43 --> 0:5:11,98
so I'll ask you to wait
with your questions


91
0:5:11,98 --> 0:5:14,64
until at the very
end, unless something


92
0:5:14,64 --> 0:5:19,92
is horribly vague or confusing.


93
0:5:19,92 --> 0:5:24,6
Now, very briefly, on the SIC,
it was installed by Parliament,


94
0:5:24,6 --> 0:5:27,8
and there were three people
appointed by the Parliament


95
0:5:27,8 --> 0:5:28,24
to sit on the Commission.


96
0:5:28,24 --> 0:5:31,39
There was a Supreme Court
justice, Pall Hreinsson,


97
0:5:31,39 --> 0:5:34,25
Sigridur Benediktsdottir, who
was a lecturer at the Economics


98
0:5:34,25 --> 0:5:36,66
Department at Yale
University at the time,


99
0:5:36,66 --> 0:5:40,38
and another lawyer,
Tryggvi Gunnarsson,


100
0:5:40,38 --> 0:5:43,72
who's Althingi's Ombudsman.


101
0:5:43,72 --> 0:5:47,8
Althingi is the
Icelandic parliament.


102
0:5:47,8 --> 0:5:53,45
Now, the mandate was not
of any insignificance.


103
0:5:53,45 --> 0:5:57,85
It was to seek the truth, no
less, behind the events leading


104
0:5:57,85 --> 0:6:0,82
up to the fall of
the Icelandic banks,


105
0:6:0,82 --> 0:6:3,6
and what was also
quite challenging


106
0:6:3,6 --> 0:6:5,99
in a small society--
and bear this in mind


107
0:6:5,99 --> 0:6:7,29
throughout the lecture.


108
0:6:7,29 --> 0:6:11,75
Iceland is a large
country, relatively large,


109
0:6:11,75 --> 0:6:16,58
but we are only 330,000,
roughly, who live there.


110
0:6:16,58 --> 0:6:20,375
So somebody told me
half of Frankfurt.


111
0:6:20,375 --> 0:6:26,89
Half of Frankfurt-- that struck
me as a quite a good benchmark.


112
0:6:26,89 --> 0:6:33,74
Now, the challenging part
was to basically find out


113
0:6:33,74 --> 0:6:36,85
whether mistakes or
negligence had occurred


114
0:6:36,85 --> 0:6:41,72
in the course of the
implementation of the laws


115
0:6:41,72 --> 0:6:44,61
and other rules regulating,
or providing control for,


116
0:6:44,61 --> 0:6:46,3
the financial market.


117
0:6:46,3 --> 0:6:50,65
And in addition, what
persons may be responsible?


118
0:6:50,65 --> 0:6:55,16
Now, the degrees of
separation in Iceland


119
0:6:55,16 --> 0:6:59,76
is obviously one or two, so
this is a delicate matter.


120
0:6:59,76 --> 0:7:5,45
This was a privilege to actually
be involved with this effort,


121
0:7:5,45 --> 0:7:8,6
simply because the
Icelandic parliament thought


122
0:7:8,6 --> 0:7:15,75
that it would be impossible to
deliver a proper investigation


123
0:7:15,75 --> 0:7:22,39
without full access to all
data that the Commission deemed


124
0:7:22,39 --> 0:7:27,24
necessary to deliver
on their mission.


125
0:7:27,24 --> 0:7:33,22
Now, we basically had powers
to search all premises,


126
0:7:33,22 --> 0:7:34,93
seize evidence
considered necessary


127
0:7:34,93 --> 0:7:36,58
for the purpose of
its investigation,


128
0:7:36,58 --> 0:7:38,44
subpoena witnesses.


129
0:7:38,44 --> 0:7:43,65
And in return, we were to
report any suspicious contact


130
0:7:43,65 --> 0:7:49,75
to the special prosecutor,
who was still working on cases


131
0:7:49,75 --> 0:7:54,35
brought about as a result of
this investigation and other.


132
0:7:54,35 --> 0:7:59,28
The final product was
a 2,400-page report,


133
0:7:59,28 --> 0:8:6,51
published 12th of April 2010,
and the task was quite big.


134
0:8:6,51 --> 0:8:9,7
We did not like the
Lehman examiner's report.


135
0:8:9,7 --> 0:8:11,1
It's also 2,400 pages.


136
0:8:11,1 --> 0:8:16,22
We'll go over that soon,
but just to tell you,


137
0:8:16,22 --> 0:8:21,31
the scope of the research was
the third-largest bankruptcy


138
0:8:21,31 --> 0:8:23,62
in history.


139
0:8:23,62 --> 0:8:28,73
And we had to go
into three banks--


140
0:8:28,73 --> 0:8:31,89
not only one-- and all
surveillance authorities


141
0:8:31,89 --> 0:8:38,2
involved with oversight
of the financial sector.


142
0:8:38,2 --> 0:8:40,84
In addition, a special
request from Parliament


143
0:8:40,84 --> 0:8:43,539
was to investigate
the cross-ownership


144
0:8:43,539 --> 0:8:47,39
of Icelandic firms,
and I think there,


145
0:8:47,39 --> 0:8:50,63
the biggest contribution to the
rest of the world of finance


146
0:8:50,63 --> 0:8:51,51
lies.


147
0:8:51,51 --> 0:8:55,81
This analysis into
the cross-ownership


148
0:8:55,81 --> 0:8:58,29
of Icelandic firms.


149
0:8:58,29 --> 0:9:0,54
Now, we were 48 people.


150
0:9:0,54 --> 0:9:5,29
We're, again, 330,000
people living in Iceland,


151
0:9:5,29 --> 0:9:8,96
and it was quite
remarkable that we


152
0:9:8,96 --> 0:9:14,45
were able to find people who
were not conflicted in any way.


153
0:9:14,45 --> 0:9:18,2
Many of them had been
living here in the States.


154
0:9:18,2 --> 0:9:24,9
Most of them had done
research, were PhDs from here


155
0:9:24,9 --> 0:9:28,702
in the States-- Yale,
Stanford, and elsewhere.


156
0:9:28,702 --> 0:9:33,15
So basically, with
all this data,


157
0:9:33,15 --> 0:9:41,47
we collected data from the
entire financial market,


158
0:9:41,47 --> 0:9:44,57
funding of the banks, all
loan portfolios of the banks,


159
0:9:44,57 --> 0:9:50,45
so every single loan,
including Visa statements,


160
0:9:50,45 --> 0:9:57,62
the salary data, and also, what
I'm particularly proud of-- we


161
0:9:57,62 --> 0:10:0,32
gathered data from
the stock market,


162
0:10:0,32 --> 0:10:4,88
and down to basically
individual investors


163
0:10:4,88 --> 0:10:9,65
on both sides of
the trade-- so this


164
0:10:9,65 --> 0:10:12,57
is a high-frequency dataset.


165
0:10:12,57 --> 0:10:16,61
In addition to the data I
mentioned before, we also


166
0:10:16,61 --> 0:10:20,32
received the entire registry
of enterprises in Iceland,


167
0:10:20,32 --> 0:10:25,11
and that was essential
to be able to drill down


168
0:10:25,11 --> 0:10:28,6
the cross-ownership of firms.


169
0:10:28,6 --> 0:10:34,51
Now, just for the
sake of comparison,


170
0:10:34,51 --> 0:10:37,5
the cost of the
investigation-- you


171
0:10:37,5 --> 0:10:39,12
can find the whole
report on this.


172
0:10:39,12 --> 0:10:43,26
There are selected chapters
translated in English.


173
0:10:43,26 --> 0:10:47,72
2,400 pages, 800
pages supplement


174
0:10:47,72 --> 0:10:51,27
online-- it took us 15
months, and the cost


175
0:10:51,27 --> 0:10:54,34
was $2.5 million US.


176
0:10:54,34 --> 0:10:59,51
Now, the examiner report on
the fall of Lehman Brothers


177
0:10:59,51 --> 0:11:1,56
is also available online.


178
0:11:1,56 --> 0:11:3,99
It is 2,200 pages.


179
0:11:3,99 --> 0:11:8,14
It took them 15
months to get it done.


180
0:11:8,14 --> 0:11:11,8
The cost was $38
million-plus US.


181
0:11:11,8 --> 0:11:14,97
So you can see that
you can get experts


182
0:11:14,97 --> 0:11:15,18
from Iceland on the cheap.


183
0:11:15,18 --> 0:11:18,38
[LAUGHTER]


184
0:11:18,38 --> 0:11:21,68
Now, to start answering
the questions I proposed


185
0:11:21,68 --> 0:11:27,52
in the beginning--
how did this happen?


186
0:11:27,52 --> 0:11:30,48
At the early start,
funding was easy,


187
0:11:30,48 --> 0:11:33,98
and basically the bankers went
into the European medium-term


188
0:11:33,98 --> 0:11:40,29
note market, and received
about 35 billion euros'


189
0:11:40,29 --> 0:11:42,64
worth of bond issues.


190
0:11:42,64 --> 0:11:44,65
AUDIENCE: Sorry, the
European what market?


191
0:11:44,65 --> 0:11:48,39
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: The European
medium-term note market.


192
0:11:48,39 --> 0:11:53,62
That is a standardized,
bond-issuance program.


193
0:11:53,62 --> 0:12:0,41
So you see here that
the columns here


194
0:12:0,41 --> 0:12:4,43
show that the
European market had


195
0:12:4,43 --> 0:12:8,47
a big appetite for the
Icelandic bonds in 2005.


196
0:12:8,47 --> 0:12:10,81
It dropped somewhat
in 2006, and you


197
0:12:10,81 --> 0:12:14,86
see what opened up-- that was
the US medium-term note market.


198
0:12:14,86 --> 0:12:17,76
It opened up for
the Icelandic banks,


199
0:12:17,76 --> 0:12:21,17
simply because of this
very nice feature.


200
0:12:21,17 --> 0:12:24,84
They had a stellar credit
rating that was largely


201
0:12:24,84 --> 0:12:28,17
inherited by the Icelandic
state, which was virtually


202
0:12:28,17 --> 0:12:30,92
debt-free at the time,
but they were also


203
0:12:30,92 --> 0:12:33,57
willing to pay
high interest rates


204
0:12:33,57 --> 0:12:36,4
at the level of other
emerging-market institutions


205
0:12:36,4 --> 0:12:39,9
a with lower credit rating.


206
0:12:39,9 --> 0:12:44,1
Now, it was as if they didn't
really think this through.


207
0:12:44,1 --> 0:12:47,45
The appetite for issuing
bonds was enormous,


208
0:12:47,45 --> 0:12:52,61
but they were bond issues for
three- to five-year maturity,


209
0:12:52,61 --> 0:13:0,9
and in fact, the
first big payment


210
0:13:0,9 --> 0:13:4,42
was too big for
them to deliver on.


211
0:13:4,42 --> 0:13:8,35
So in October 2008,
Glitnir bank went


212
0:13:8,35 --> 0:13:11,18
to the Central Bank of
Iceland, and basically said


213
0:13:11,18 --> 0:13:13,98
that they wouldn't be
able to meet this payment,


214
0:13:13,98 --> 0:13:18,17
and asked for of a loan of
last resort, and from then on,


215
0:13:18,17 --> 0:13:21,74
things started to
unravel quickly.


216
0:13:21,74 --> 0:13:26,7
Now, the terms were
good in the beginning,


217
0:13:26,7 --> 0:13:29,1
as credit rating went
through the roof.


218
0:13:29,1 --> 0:13:32,18
In 2007, they received
the highest grade,


219
0:13:32,18 --> 0:13:38,2
top of the class, triple-A
rating from Moody's, which


220
0:13:38,2 --> 0:13:41,53
Moody's corrected in
a couple of months.


221
0:13:41,53 --> 0:13:47,52
Moody's thought that these banks
were simply too big to fail,


222
0:13:47,52 --> 0:13:55,85
and would be bailed out in
whichever circumstances,


223
0:13:55,85 --> 0:13:59,61
but failed to recognize
that the banks had already


224
0:13:59,61 --> 0:14:2,98
exceeded the GDP, where
everything we produce


225
0:14:2,98 --> 0:14:6,45
in Iceland 10 times,
so we would never


226
0:14:6,45 --> 0:14:8,94
be able to bail out those banks.


227
0:14:8,94 --> 0:14:12,66
Now, as you see here, it's
a nice-- here at Google,


228
0:14:12,66 --> 0:14:15,72
the first thing you do
is to plot your data--


229
0:14:15,72 --> 0:14:20,12
and here you see Kaupthing
five-year bond issues.


230
0:14:20,12 --> 0:14:23,5
At the beginning, they are
issuing 1 billion euros.


231
0:14:23,5 --> 0:14:29,1
At the time, at a rate around
20, 20 to 30, and it rapidly


232
0:14:29,1 --> 0:14:30,41
grows.


233
0:14:30,41 --> 0:14:32,77
Here are some peculiar outliers.


234
0:14:32,77 --> 0:14:38,34
Somebody is accepting much
lower rate than the market is.


235
0:14:38,34 --> 0:14:44,52
Now, we did receive our warning.


236
0:14:44,52 --> 0:14:48,17
In 2006, a market
analyst started


237
0:14:48,17 --> 0:14:52,75
to point out that this
rapid growth of the balance


238
0:14:52,75 --> 0:14:55,1
sheets of the banks
was unsustainable,


239
0:14:55,1 --> 0:14:58,52
and, well, primarily,
Danske Bank


240
0:14:58,52 --> 0:15:3,1
came up with this very nice
term for it-- the geysir crisis.


241
0:15:3,1 --> 0:15:6,4
And it fitted this
episode very well,


242
0:15:6,4 --> 0:15:9,63
because the CDS spreads--
the Credit Default


243
0:15:9,63 --> 0:15:14,86
Spreads-- they kind of blew
up, but settled down quickly


244
0:15:14,86 --> 0:15:17,81
again at a lower level.


245
0:15:17,81 --> 0:15:23,38
But that did not measure up to
what was to happen later on,


246
0:15:23,38 --> 0:15:26,5
when the big, blue
mountain blew up,


247
0:15:26,5 --> 0:15:32,68
and we had CDS spreads going
through the 1,000 mark.


248
0:15:32,68 --> 0:15:37,4
Both Icelandic bankers
and officials alike


249
0:15:37,4 --> 0:15:39,74
dismissed this market
signal completely,


250
0:15:39,74 --> 0:15:43,73
and they claimed
that the CDS market


251
0:15:43,73 --> 0:15:47,9
was marked by
collusion, ignorance--


252
0:15:47,9 --> 0:15:51,66
it was a thin market,
and so on, and so forth.


253
0:15:51,66 --> 0:15:54,2
And it is just as if
they didn't really


254
0:15:54,2 --> 0:15:55,59
know what they
were talking about,


255
0:15:55,59 --> 0:16:1,68
or they didn't really look,
because when the banks failed,


256
0:16:1,68 --> 0:16:6,27
there were $70 billion
US outstanding CDS


257
0:16:6,27 --> 0:16:8,15
contracts on those three banks.


258
0:16:8,15 --> 0:16:12,67
And again, comparing to Lehman,
outstanding CDS contracts


259
0:16:12,67 --> 0:16:15,41
on Lehman were
$72 billion, so it


260
0:16:15,41 --> 0:16:21,444
was, by no means, a liquid
market, in that sense.


261
0:16:21,444 --> 0:16:23,11
Of course, it's a
market with insurance,


262
0:16:23,11 --> 0:16:27,64
so it's not going to behave
like stock markets, right?


263
0:16:27,64 --> 0:16:35,21
Now, being faced with such
a high cost of funding,


264
0:16:35,21 --> 0:16:41,99
the banks simply had to turn
elsewhere to refund the banks,


265
0:16:41,99 --> 0:16:43,72
and where did they go?


266
0:16:43,72 --> 0:16:46,53
They went into two directions.


267
0:16:46,53 --> 0:16:50,48
One was to go to the supremely
informed central banks,


268
0:16:50,48 --> 0:16:56,5
and they managed to borrow the
equivalent of 9 billion euros


269
0:16:56,5 --> 0:16:58,33
at the very height.


270
0:16:58,33 --> 0:17:2,2
Again, comparing to the
financial rescue package


271
0:17:2,2 --> 0:17:6,44
that Iceland received from the
IMF and the rest of Scandinavia


272
0:17:6,44 --> 0:17:13,17
was about 3.5 billion euros, so
a significant amount of money


273
0:17:13,17 --> 0:17:15,819
they borrowed from
the central banks.


274
0:17:15,819 --> 0:17:19,79
And how did they
manage to do that?


275
0:17:19,79 --> 0:17:25,31
Well, they backed it with
bank bonds, to large degree.


276
0:17:25,31 --> 0:17:28,17
Here you can see the
collateralized lending


277
0:17:28,17 --> 0:17:29,99
from the Central
Bank of Iceland.


278
0:17:29,99 --> 0:17:33,34
This is denominated in ISK,
so you can see basically


279
0:17:33,34 --> 0:17:39,51
how dependent they are of this
short-term, fine-tuning funding


280
0:17:39,51 --> 0:17:42,41
facility from the central bank,
so for three years, they're


281
0:17:42,41 --> 0:17:46,64
completely dependent here on
the $100 billion-- at the time,


282
0:17:46,64 --> 0:17:49,54
was roughly half of the
budget of the Icelandic state.


283
0:17:49,54 --> 0:17:51,183
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?


284
0:17:51,183 --> 0:17:52,266
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Say again?


285
0:17:52,266 --> 0:17:54,99
AUDIENCE: What's the
conversion [INAUDIBLE]?


286
0:17:54,99 --> 0:17:57,99
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Roughly 100.


287
0:17:57,99 --> 0:18:4,73
Now, they backed it with
government-secured bonds,


288
0:18:4,73 --> 0:18:9,8
but also with fellow bank
bonds, and that they did


289
0:18:9,8 --> 0:18:13,44
at an increasing rate.


290
0:18:13,44 --> 0:18:17,54
The central bank
acknowledged that


291
0:18:17,54 --> 0:18:21,7
this collateralized lending
was getting excessive,


292
0:18:21,7 --> 0:18:25,9
so they tried to stem the
funding to three banks,


293
0:18:25,9 --> 0:18:28,31
but the bankers really
didn't stop at that,


294
0:18:28,31 --> 0:18:31,96
so they asked a rival,
small, cooperative bank


295
0:18:31,96 --> 0:18:35,3
to aid them in the process of
virtually printing money out


296
0:18:35,3 --> 0:18:37,22
of the Icelandic Central Bank.


297
0:18:37,22 --> 0:18:41,9
So what they did was they
issued new bonds, fresh bonds.


298
0:18:41,9 --> 0:18:46,51
That's a certain interest
term, and then they


299
0:18:46,51 --> 0:18:50,48
turned to the rival bank, which
received the bank bonds, which


300
0:18:50,48 --> 0:18:53,49
then, again, turned to the
Central Bank of Iceland


301
0:18:53,49 --> 0:18:59,5
to get liquidity out the
Central Bank of Iceland.


302
0:18:59,5 --> 0:19:2,8
And the bankers reported it
to the Special Investigation


303
0:19:2,8 --> 0:19:6,99
Commission that this was a
stunt that they played, and had


304
0:19:6,99 --> 0:19:11,32
learned about from other
European bankers, which


305
0:19:11,32 --> 0:19:14,48
is a little bit
worrying, obviously.


306
0:19:14,48 --> 0:19:20,3
Now, they did try to play the
same trick on the European


307
0:19:20,3 --> 0:19:23,7
Central Bank.


308
0:19:23,7 --> 0:19:30,27
They placed bonds as
collateral against the loans


309
0:19:30,27 --> 0:19:33,37
from the European
Central Bank, but you


310
0:19:33,37 --> 0:19:36,95
see how they pick
up on it in May,


311
0:19:36,95 --> 0:19:42,11
and the story goes
that the ECB basically


312
0:19:42,11 --> 0:19:46,31
directed their demands towards
the governors of the Central


313
0:19:46,31 --> 0:19:50,43
Bank of Iceland to have
the bankers take this out,


314
0:19:50,43 --> 0:19:52,26
realizing that they
were swapping bonds.


315
0:19:52,26 --> 0:19:57,24
There was no original investor
backing them at the outset,


316
0:19:57,24 --> 0:20:2,85
and after awhile, they basically
disappeared from the books


317
0:20:2,85 --> 0:20:5,8
as collaterals of the ECB.


318
0:20:5,8 --> 0:20:11,23
Now, what they did,
though, and the amounts


319
0:20:11,23 --> 0:20:17,11
were quite steep-- 4.5
billion euros they received


320
0:20:17,11 --> 0:20:20,44
at the very top from the
European Central Bank--


321
0:20:20,44 --> 0:20:25,2
so after having been asked to
take out the Icelandic bank


322
0:20:25,2 --> 0:20:29,9
bonds, well, they replaced
them with CLOs and CDOs


323
0:20:29,9 --> 0:20:33,58
that had ISK assets among them.


324
0:20:33,58 --> 0:20:37,92
So collateral in ISK,
in Icelandic krona,


325
0:20:37,92 --> 0:20:42,5
against the loan in euros is
not a good collateral at all,


326
0:20:42,5 --> 0:20:44,15
so there's a whole
story about that.


327
0:20:44,15 --> 0:20:48,8
And the Icelandic
Central Bank, in fact,


328
0:20:48,8 --> 0:20:52,27
bought these CLOs from
the European Central Bank


329
0:20:52,27 --> 0:21:0,7
in the year 2010, and
the European Central Bank


330
0:21:0,7 --> 0:21:4,59
reported that it did
not lose anything


331
0:21:4,59 --> 0:21:9,2
on the deals with
the Icelandic banks.


332
0:21:9,2 --> 0:21:12,135
That was not the same story
with the Icelandic central bank,


333
0:21:12,135 --> 0:21:17,8
which virtually became bankrupt,
as a result of receiving


334
0:21:17,8 --> 0:21:19,1
collaterals that
they couldn't collect


335
0:21:19,1 --> 0:21:23,49
after the banks had gone over.


336
0:21:23,49 --> 0:21:27,37
Back to the growth, and I know
I'm cheating here a little bit.


337
0:21:27,37 --> 0:21:31,58
I am showing you
here nominal growth,


338
0:21:31,58 --> 0:21:37,85
but it was reported-- nominal
growth, 20-fold in seven years.


339
0:21:37,85 --> 0:21:42,5
So prior to getting involved
with the Special Investigation


340
0:21:42,5 --> 0:21:46,52
Commission, I was working for
the IMF, where we were studying


341
0:21:46,52 --> 0:21:48,65
rapid credit growth,
and I can tell you


342
0:21:48,65 --> 0:21:53,79
that it's impossible
to find data


343
0:21:53,79 --> 0:22:1,3
that would show you larger
growth of any banking sector.


344
0:22:1,3 --> 0:22:7,98
Now, obviously, when you
see banks grow this fast,


345
0:22:7,98 --> 0:22:9,88
some people get worried.


346
0:22:9,88 --> 0:22:14,77
They know that
institutional structure,


347
0:22:14,77 --> 0:22:17,33
or an institutional
capacity, does not really


348
0:22:17,33 --> 0:22:18,76
support this growth.


349
0:22:18,76 --> 0:22:24,9
People cannot extend
credit at this fast a pace,


350
0:22:24,9 --> 0:22:29,64
and ensuring that all relevant
documents have been collected,


351
0:22:29,64 --> 0:22:33,55
and the credit scoring
has been proper.


352
0:22:33,55 --> 0:22:37,69



353
0:22:37,69 --> 0:22:40,38
So the bankers
basically pointed out,


354
0:22:40,38 --> 0:22:42,35
after receiving this
criticism, that they


355
0:22:42,35 --> 0:22:43,89
were growing too fast.


356
0:22:43,89 --> 0:22:46,3
Well, we are diversifying.


357
0:22:46,3 --> 0:22:48,29
We are getting
outside of Iceland,


358
0:22:48,29 --> 0:22:55,44
acquiring new institutions,
new banks, new endeavors.


359
0:22:55,44 --> 0:22:59,94
But when we looked at this, and
tried to verify this statement,


360
0:22:59,94 --> 0:23:5,16
we saw that not only was the
acquisition growth large,


361
0:23:5,16 --> 0:23:10,16
but the organic growth was also
quite large-- another world


362
0:23:10,16 --> 0:23:11,65
record, basically.


363
0:23:11,65 --> 0:23:16,859
We saw the banks
grow 50%, 60%, 35%.


364
0:23:16,859 --> 0:23:17,65
This is phenomenal.


365
0:23:17,65 --> 0:23:20,56



366
0:23:20,56 --> 0:23:27,1
So it surely was a strain on the
institutional infrastructure.


367
0:23:27,1 --> 0:23:29,91
Now, then you could
ask yourself, again


368
0:23:29,91 --> 0:23:33,85
with the 330,000 people,
all of this money coming in,


369
0:23:33,85 --> 0:23:35,25
what did they do with the money?


370
0:23:35,25 --> 0:23:42,33



371
0:23:42,33 --> 0:23:44,89
The Commission
basically was able to,


372
0:23:44,89 --> 0:23:50,57
although the data that was a
little bit difficult there--


373
0:23:50,57 --> 0:23:53,39
background variables
weren't properly collected--


374
0:23:53,39 --> 0:23:56,56
but there are features in
the identification number,


375
0:23:56,56 --> 0:23:58,77
or social security
number in Iceland,


376
0:23:58,77 --> 0:24:1,86
that aided us in
categorizing the loans that


377
0:24:1,86 --> 0:24:3,74
had been extended.


378
0:24:3,74 --> 0:24:7,3
And we found out that
about 60% of the loan books


379
0:24:7,3 --> 0:24:12,28
were to foreign entities--
so implying diversification--


380
0:24:12,28 --> 0:24:19,46
and to holding
companies in 2007.


381
0:24:19,46 --> 0:24:24,73
But after good cooperation
with Luxembourgian authorities,


382
0:24:24,73 --> 0:24:29,41
because we didn't, obviously,
have the same data privileges


383
0:24:29,41 --> 0:24:33,22
in the UK or Luxembourg
or elsewhere,


384
0:24:33,22 --> 0:24:35,44
where the Icelandic
banks had operations.


385
0:24:35,44 --> 0:24:43,37
We did not have any access to
data from the subsidiaries.


386
0:24:43,37 --> 0:24:46,56
The Luxembourgian
authorities supplied us


387
0:24:46,56 --> 0:24:49,477
with two data points,
where we could


388
0:24:49,477 --> 0:24:53,14
see that the maturity of the
loan books of the subsidiaries


389
0:24:53,14 --> 0:24:59,49
were also somehow
connected to ISK risk,


390
0:24:59,49 --> 0:25:5,32
so dismissing this statement
that the growth was primarily


391
0:25:5,32 --> 0:25:10,1
outside of the country, and at
the hands of diversification.


392
0:25:10,1 --> 0:25:15,34
Now, back to that
small population,


393
0:25:15,34 --> 0:25:19,19
you've got to wonder how
is it possible to extend


394
0:25:19,19 --> 0:25:24,73
such an amount of credit, given
the legal constraint that one


395
0:25:24,73 --> 0:25:28,95
banking institution can
only extend about 25%


396
0:25:28,95 --> 0:25:35,29
of its equity base towards
a group of related parties?


397
0:25:35,29 --> 0:25:41,27
Now, we think we
know how you do that,


398
0:25:41,27 --> 0:25:45,52
and this is basically
how you do that.


399
0:25:45,52 --> 0:25:49,68
This is the cross-ownership
of firms in Iceland.


400
0:25:49,68 --> 0:25:52,89
The red dots
represent each firm,


401
0:25:52,89 --> 0:25:56,17
and there are some ownership
connections to the next dot,


402
0:25:56,17 --> 0:26:3,59
but these are only large firms
in Iceland, so let's say,


403
0:26:3,59 --> 0:26:8,33
500 million ISK is $5
million US, roughly,


404
0:26:8,33 --> 0:26:12,93
is the balance sheet of
each and every firm here.


405
0:26:12,93 --> 0:26:15,17
You see where the nodes lead?


406
0:26:15,17 --> 0:26:19,47
These nodes are the
banks themselves,


407
0:26:19,47 --> 0:26:21,6
so this is the
interconnectedness


408
0:26:21,6 --> 0:26:25,56
of the Icelandic economy
before the collapse.


409
0:26:25,56 --> 0:26:34,5
Then our task was to assess
who are the related parties,


410
0:26:34,5 --> 0:26:37,7
according to the
definition of the law?


411
0:26:37,7 --> 0:26:40,88
And using an algorithm
and this network analysis,


412
0:26:40,88 --> 0:26:44,87
we were able to assess,
or rather come up


413
0:26:44,87 --> 0:26:49,26
with an unbiased methodology,
to actually find out


414
0:26:49,26 --> 0:26:52,93
who were connected, and here you
see just two random examples.


415
0:26:52,93 --> 0:26:58,61
And what was also a
little bit scary to see


416
0:26:58,61 --> 0:27:2,8
is the circular
events that you see.


417
0:27:2,8 --> 0:27:4,91
Here is a firm A that
owns firm B that owns firm


418
0:27:4,91 --> 0:27:9,49
C that owns firm A. So
under these circumstances,


419
0:27:9,49 --> 0:27:14,81
virtually no equity, no
skin, is put in the game.


420
0:27:14,81 --> 0:27:22,16
So one of the lessons is
that if we don't properly


421
0:27:22,16 --> 0:27:26,31
analyze ownership
or ownership ties


422
0:27:26,31 --> 0:27:29,84
or interconnectedness
in our system,


423
0:27:29,84 --> 0:27:36,305
we know that agents that play
this game simply have-- the sky


424
0:27:36,305 --> 0:27:40,54
is the limit, so there's really
no limit to how much risk


425
0:27:40,54 --> 0:27:42,75
they're willing to take,
because they are not


426
0:27:42,75 --> 0:27:46,6
risking their own money at all.


427
0:27:46,6 --> 0:27:52,23
Now, after we had identified
the related parties,


428
0:27:52,23 --> 0:27:54,41
we then merged them
to the portfolios


429
0:27:54,41 --> 0:27:58,73
of the banks-- the loan
portfolios-- and lo and behold,


430
0:27:58,73 --> 0:28:2,47
we found out that the borrowers
were, to a large extent,


431
0:28:2,47 --> 0:28:5,3
the owners of the banks.


432
0:28:5,3 --> 0:28:9,81
It varied a little bit
in levels how much access


433
0:28:9,81 --> 0:28:13,71
they had to their bank, but
here, this particular group,


434
0:28:13,71 --> 0:28:19,73
Baugur Group, received the
equivalent of about 80%


435
0:28:19,73 --> 0:28:26,96
of the equity base
of Glitnir, where


436
0:28:26,96 --> 0:28:29,2
they were controlling
shareholders.


437
0:28:29,2 --> 0:28:30,83
So here you see the
legal limit is 25.


438
0:28:30,83 --> 0:28:34,24
They exceeded it
throughout the time.


439
0:28:34,24 --> 0:28:37,55
Now, here's their
business partner,


440
0:28:37,55 --> 0:28:40,69
who also gained a
controlling stake at the bank


441
0:28:40,69 --> 0:28:41,57
at some point.


442
0:28:41,57 --> 0:28:44,106
Somebody wants to venture
a guess when that happened?


443
0:28:44,106 --> 0:28:44,96
AUDIENCE: 2007.


444
0:28:44,96 --> 0:28:51,81
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: So yeah, it's
right here, in June 2007.


445
0:28:51,81 --> 0:28:56,95
So as I say, it was the same
pattern in all three banks.


446
0:28:56,95 --> 0:29:1,12
Here Bjorgolfur
Thor Bjorgolfsson,


447
0:29:1,12 --> 0:29:3,8
one of the controlling
stakeholders,


448
0:29:3,8 --> 0:29:8,7
exceeded the 25% threshold
throughout the four-year period


449
0:29:8,7 --> 0:29:12,89
we had data for.


450
0:29:12,89 --> 0:29:16,6
And the same goes for Exista,
controlling stakeholder


451
0:29:16,6 --> 0:29:19,83
in Kaupthing bank, again,
dancing along the line


452
0:29:19,83 --> 0:29:22,51
throughout the period.


453
0:29:22,51 --> 0:29:25,35
Now, obviously the
loan portfolios


454
0:29:25,35 --> 0:29:30,49
were marked by excessive
risk, and the next task


455
0:29:30,49 --> 0:29:33,9
was to see the payment
structure of these loans,


456
0:29:33,9 --> 0:29:37,48
and that was also quite
shocking to discover


457
0:29:37,48 --> 0:29:39,98
that not only had
they been extended


458
0:29:39,98 --> 0:29:43,55
to holding companies that
were tied to the owners


459
0:29:43,55 --> 0:29:45,97
to a large degree,
but also they were not


460
0:29:45,97 --> 0:29:47,98
paying anything off the loans.


461
0:29:47,98 --> 0:29:50,0
They were not paying
interest rates,


462
0:29:50,0 --> 0:29:52,96
and they were not paying
off any of the loan


463
0:29:52,96 --> 0:29:55,35
during the lifetime of
the loan, so bullet loans


464
0:29:55,35 --> 0:29:59,72
became the largest
share of the portfolios.


465
0:29:59,72 --> 0:30:2,92
Then you wonder, what
type of collateral


466
0:30:2,92 --> 0:30:7,57
are these borrowers
putting forward?


467
0:30:7,57 --> 0:30:8,57
And that really matters.


468
0:30:8,57 --> 0:30:15,48



469
0:30:15,48 --> 0:30:19,72
Because we had this beautiful
data privilege and this dataset


470
0:30:19,72 --> 0:30:23,87
from the stock market, and we
had also access to the bank,


471
0:30:23,87 --> 0:30:27,6
so we could see what was
inside of the custodian


472
0:30:27,6 --> 0:30:30,15
accounts of the banks, because
that's an old trick in the book


473
0:30:30,15 --> 0:30:33,66
to have your bank hold the
stocks that you are pledged,


474
0:30:33,66 --> 0:30:37,37
so your ownership is
not disclosed at all.


475
0:30:37,37 --> 0:30:40,34



476
0:30:40,34 --> 0:30:42,73
So what did they pledge?


477
0:30:42,73 --> 0:30:45,92
Basically, to a large
degree, the banks


478
0:30:45,92 --> 0:30:48,93
had received a
collateral in the form


479
0:30:48,93 --> 0:30:51,33
of listed stocks in Iceland.


480
0:30:51,33 --> 0:30:54,38



481
0:30:54,38 --> 0:30:59,41
There is a caveat here, because
the data quality on collateral


482
0:30:59,41 --> 0:31:3,9
was incredibly poor,
so this was really


483
0:31:3,9 --> 0:31:9,83
the only comprehensive
data that we could receive,


484
0:31:9,83 --> 0:31:11,37
in terms of collateral.


485
0:31:11,37 --> 0:31:13,91
So this is a little bit
misrepresentative here,


486
0:31:13,91 --> 0:31:18,35
but still we saw
that, for example,


487
0:31:18,35 --> 0:31:21,65
FL Group was an investment
boutique, or investment


488
0:31:21,65 --> 0:31:25,7
closed-end fund, in
fact, and about 70%


489
0:31:25,7 --> 0:31:28,61
of all outstanding
shares in this firm


490
0:31:28,61 --> 0:31:32,66
were pledged into
the banking sector.


491
0:31:32,66 --> 0:31:45,25
To our horror, though, we saw
that about 40% of Kaupthing


492
0:31:45,25 --> 0:31:49,25
was pledged into Kaupthing
as collateral, or as treasury


493
0:31:49,25 --> 0:31:50,53
stocks.


494
0:31:50,53 --> 0:31:52,9
Now, that is illegal.


495
0:31:52,9 --> 0:31:55,23
You are only allowed,
according to Icelandic law,


496
0:31:55,23 --> 0:31:58,11
to hold 10% of treasury stocks.


497
0:31:58,11 --> 0:32:2,86
This is illegal in the States.


498
0:32:2,86 --> 0:32:5,37
At least if you do
have treasury stocks,


499
0:32:5,37 --> 0:32:8,5
you need to deduct them
from your equity base.


500
0:32:8,5 --> 0:32:13,82
It's money that hasn't
been paid into the firm,


501
0:32:13,82 --> 0:32:17,51
or equity that hasn't
been paid into the firm.


502
0:32:17,51 --> 0:32:20,5
The following question,
after having discovered this,


503
0:32:20,5 --> 0:32:23,34
we had to ask ourselves, how
did they behave in the stock


504
0:32:23,34 --> 0:32:25,54
market, then, I mean,
now that they were


505
0:32:25,54 --> 0:32:29,93
dependent on collaterals
from the stock market?


506
0:32:29,93 --> 0:32:35,92
And lo and behold, we saw a
certain pattern there as well.


507
0:32:35,92 --> 0:32:41,88
Here you see Kaupthing
trading in own shares,


508
0:32:41,88 --> 0:32:47,45
and Kaupthing is buying above
0, and they are selling below 0,


509
0:32:47,45 --> 0:32:49,32
and the blue line
here represents


510
0:32:49,32 --> 0:32:56,9
the price of the share price
of the Kaupthing stocks.


511
0:32:56,9 --> 0:32:59,4
And you immediately-- it
jumps out of the picture


512
0:32:59,4 --> 0:33:2,22
that this is not
symmetric, so they


513
0:33:2,22 --> 0:33:6,79
are buying close to
60% of the volume.


514
0:33:6,79 --> 0:33:9,24
Of all trades in
Kaupthing, they are


515
0:33:9,24 --> 0:33:11,337
on the buying side
at the very end,


516
0:33:11,337 --> 0:33:13,17
but what are they doing
in terms of selling?


517
0:33:13,17 --> 0:33:15,57
They're not selling anything.


518
0:33:15,57 --> 0:33:19,91
So what were they then doing?


519
0:33:19,91 --> 0:33:22,39
What type of business was this?


520
0:33:22,39 --> 0:33:25,345
What we figured out was
that they were primarily--


521
0:33:25,345 --> 0:33:28,64
you see the blue columns
here-- they are above 0,


522
0:33:28,64 --> 0:33:32,5
so they are being bought
on the stock exchange,


523
0:33:32,5 --> 0:33:36,77
but Kaupthing is selling
over the counter.


524
0:33:36,77 --> 0:33:42,86
Now, one of my favorite pictures
in the whole 2,400 pages


525
0:33:42,86 --> 0:33:44,8
is right here.


526
0:33:44,8 --> 0:33:48,77
It represents the level of
leverage in the Icelandic stock


527
0:33:48,77 --> 0:33:51,14
exchange.


528
0:33:51,14 --> 0:33:53,68
It's a delta, so how
much are we increasing,


529
0:33:53,68 --> 0:33:59,5
in terms of taking collateral
in the form of listed shares?


530
0:33:59,5 --> 0:34:2,32
And as long as you are receiving
more and more collateral,


531
0:34:2,32 --> 0:34:5,28
or you're accepting
more and more collateral


532
0:34:5,28 --> 0:34:9,6
in the form of stocks they
are buying on the margin


533
0:34:9,6 --> 0:34:11,655
more and more, you see
that the price is rising.


534
0:34:11,655 --> 0:34:14,429



535
0:34:14,429 --> 0:34:16,48
The red line there
leveling out--


536
0:34:16,48 --> 0:34:21,37
as soon as you stop accepting
listed shares as collateral,


537
0:34:21,37 --> 0:34:23,44
the price drops like a stone.


538
0:34:23,44 --> 0:34:28,184
So this is virtually a picture
of an asset price bubble.


539
0:34:28,184 --> 0:34:32,639



540
0:34:32,639 --> 0:34:34,43
AUDIENCE: Why were they
buying [INAUDIBLE]?


541
0:34:34,43 --> 0:34:44,231



542
0:34:44,231 --> 0:34:45,73
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Why
were they buying


543
0:34:45,73 --> 0:34:47,92
all these shares in themselves?


544
0:34:47,92 --> 0:34:53,17
Basically they had become quite
dependent on the share price,


545
0:34:53,17 --> 0:34:56,34
and we will see it on
the next slide, which


546
0:34:56,34 --> 0:34:59,18
added to their demise,
is that the largest


547
0:34:59,18 --> 0:35:0,79
controlling
stakeholders had also


548
0:35:0,79 --> 0:35:4,21
borrowed money from the big
investment houses in the US--


549
0:35:4,21 --> 0:35:6,6
so Citigroup, Morgan
Stanley, and those--


550
0:35:6,6 --> 0:35:8,88
and they had pledged
the Icelandic stocks


551
0:35:8,88 --> 0:35:11,45
in the Icelandic
banks as collateral


552
0:35:11,45 --> 0:35:14,94
against these
international loans.


553
0:35:14,94 --> 0:35:20,19
Now, after the stock market
had started to decline,


554
0:35:20,19 --> 0:35:23,21
the Americans basically
called on the margin,


555
0:35:23,21 --> 0:35:26,52
and what the bankers in
Iceland decided then-- well,


556
0:35:26,52 --> 0:35:28,33
we can't allow this to
happen, because they


557
0:35:28,33 --> 0:35:30,72
will go into the market,
and sell those shares,


558
0:35:30,72 --> 0:35:33,21
and what will happen with
our pool of collaterals?


559
0:35:33,21 --> 0:35:34,58
It will decline.


560
0:35:34,58 --> 0:35:38,75
So they decide to chip in,
and pay the margin calls,


561
0:35:38,75 --> 0:35:42,58
and refund those shares that
were in themselves, accepting


562
0:35:42,58 --> 0:35:44,5
their own shares as collateral.


563
0:35:44,5 --> 0:35:48,25
So basically, a year
before the banks


564
0:35:48,25 --> 0:35:50,43
finally collapsed,
they had become


565
0:35:50,43 --> 0:35:53,24
so dependent on their
own stock prices


566
0:35:53,24 --> 0:35:56,23
that they decide
to bat for life,


567
0:35:56,23 --> 0:36:3,9
and take over this collateral
that is no collateral,


568
0:36:3,9 --> 0:36:5,9
if they themselves go under.


569
0:36:5,9 --> 0:36:7,84



570
0:36:7,84 --> 0:36:11,39
Which then, again, this
would have been fine


571
0:36:11,39 --> 0:36:15,89
if they had deducted the
shares that they took


572
0:36:15,89 --> 0:36:18,8
as collaterals from
the equity base,


573
0:36:18,8 --> 0:36:21,3
but they forgot about that.


574
0:36:21,3 --> 0:36:25,77
So if we take that
into account--


575
0:36:25,77 --> 0:36:28,62
and here you see we only
take that into account--


576
0:36:28,62 --> 0:36:31,67
the capital adequacy
ratio that they reported


577
0:36:31,67 --> 0:36:35,96
was misreported basically,
and here you see Glitnir.


578
0:36:35,96 --> 0:36:39,86
It's, in fact, close to
the legal limit, which


579
0:36:39,86 --> 0:36:45,9
is 8%, a year before
the bank collapsed.


580
0:36:45,9 --> 0:36:50,94
For Landsbanki, it had already
gone below the 8% limit,


581
0:36:50,94 --> 0:36:53,42
so there the Financial
Supervisory Authority


582
0:36:53,42 --> 0:36:59,77
should have tapped in and
taken over the operations.


583
0:36:59,77 --> 0:37:4,39
And if you count
cross-financing--


584
0:37:4,39 --> 0:37:6,65
financing of the
rivals-- in fact,


585
0:37:6,65 --> 0:37:12,887
22% of the equity is basically
funded this way, and 36%, 33%,


586
0:37:12,887 --> 0:37:18,36
2008, so one third of the
equity was basically not there,


587
0:37:18,36 --> 0:37:21,7
and in my mind, that is
falsification of equity,


588
0:37:21,7 --> 0:37:24,62
but the report goes the route
that claiming that this is weak


589
0:37:24,62 --> 0:37:30,1
equity that cannot be drawn
on in the case of bankruptcy.


590
0:37:30,1 --> 0:37:38,56
Now, you've got to start
wondering why people do this,


591
0:37:38,56 --> 0:37:43,2
and the short answer
is, they became rich.


592
0:37:43,2 --> 0:37:45,71
Here you see the
incentive schemes


593
0:37:45,71 --> 0:37:49,37
pushed for excessive
risk taking,


594
0:37:49,37 --> 0:37:53,63
and just as a very
small evidence


595
0:37:53,63 --> 0:37:59,33
of that is that here you see
the total share of base salary,


596
0:37:59,33 --> 0:38:4,64
of total pay, in
2004 in Landsbanki.


597
0:38:4,64 --> 0:38:8,2
Here's the 99th percentile,
so the CEO is placed here,


598
0:38:8,2 --> 0:38:12,9
and the key personnel--
they received about 40%


599
0:38:12,9 --> 0:38:15,53
in base salary in 2004.


600
0:38:15,53 --> 0:38:22,38
In 2007, it's below
10%, so economists--


601
0:38:22,38 --> 0:38:26,16
we have sympathy towards the
decision-making process that


602
0:38:26,16 --> 0:38:27,62
happens there.


603
0:38:27,62 --> 0:38:32,7
One, if you're not going to meet
your bonus target, you going


604
0:38:32,7 --> 0:38:35,18
to reduce your
consumption by 90%?


605
0:38:35,18 --> 0:38:38,81
No, there's is a
very strong incentive


606
0:38:38,81 --> 0:38:42,83
to start manipulating
a little bit,


607
0:38:42,83 --> 0:38:44,51
or extending the
evergreening loans,


608
0:38:44,51 --> 0:38:47,1
and so on, and so forth--
rolling over loans,


609
0:38:47,1 --> 0:38:51,549
so that the picture looks a bit
more rosy to meet the targets,


610
0:38:51,549 --> 0:38:52,965
and that is exactly
what happened.


611
0:38:52,965 --> 0:38:55,92



612
0:38:55,92 --> 0:38:59,13
There's enough material for a
separate talk on the incentive


613
0:38:59,13 --> 0:39:5,1
schemes themselves, but in
short, whether intentional


614
0:39:5,1 --> 0:39:9,65
or not, the management
of the banks


615
0:39:9,65 --> 0:39:13,53
used staff as vehicles
to falsify equity.


616
0:39:13,53 --> 0:39:16,81
In Landsbanki, for
example, stock options


617
0:39:16,81 --> 0:39:23,61
were issued one day, not as
a bargaining tool in salary


618
0:39:23,61 --> 0:39:26,8
negotiations, but
one day, we have


619
0:39:26,8 --> 0:39:31,71
a record within Landsbanki,
where staffers were called up,


620
0:39:31,71 --> 0:39:34,8
and said, hey, you've
got an option grant now.


621
0:39:34,8 --> 0:39:36,86
Please come up and sign.


622
0:39:36,86 --> 0:39:47,73
And the management decided
to hatch those options,


623
0:39:47,73 --> 0:39:53,4
so basically in the beginning,
they lent money into SPVs


624
0:39:53,4 --> 0:39:57,44
in Cayman Islands and
offshore, lent money


625
0:39:57,44 --> 0:40:2,69
to have the SPV go into the
market to buy the stocks,


626
0:40:2,69 --> 0:40:6,41
and hold them until
the options were vested


627
0:40:6,41 --> 0:40:8,8
or they were exercised.


628
0:40:8,8 --> 0:40:14,5
Now, this is a rather unusual
and unnecessary hatch.


629
0:40:14,5 --> 0:40:17,29
As I say, we can
go into depth here,


630
0:40:17,29 --> 0:40:22,5
but in short, obviously
the management


631
0:40:22,5 --> 0:40:24,35
decides on the timing on
when to go into the market


632
0:40:24,35 --> 0:40:27,52
and buy those shares, and
what happens when you inject


633
0:40:27,52 --> 0:40:32,93
into the market billions of ISK
buying stocks in Landsbanki?


634
0:40:32,93 --> 0:40:35,11
Well, the price will
go up, of course,


635
0:40:35,11 --> 0:40:38,94
and the options will be
in the money immediately.


636
0:40:38,94 --> 0:40:42,7
Kaupthing started out with this,
but they faded out their option


637
0:40:42,7 --> 0:40:47,38
program, and instead they
had their staff borrow money


638
0:40:47,38 --> 0:40:49,95
from the bank to go themselves
into the stock market,


639
0:40:49,95 --> 0:40:52,22
and buy the shares.


640
0:40:52,22 --> 0:40:59,45
The shares were a collateral
in that loan deal,


641
0:40:59,45 --> 0:41:4,64
and therefore should have been
deducted from the equity base.


642
0:41:4,64 --> 0:41:9,95
Now, back to the funding side.


643
0:41:9,95 --> 0:41:11,61



644
0:41:11,61 --> 0:41:15,18
The banks were experiencing
incredibly high prices


645
0:41:15,18 --> 0:41:18,88
on funding, or terms,
in the bond markets,


646
0:41:18,88 --> 0:41:22,93
so apart from going
to central banks,


647
0:41:22,93 --> 0:41:25,96
they went into the streets
of London and Amsterdam


648
0:41:25,96 --> 0:41:31,127
to get money through
deposit collection,


649
0:41:31,127 --> 0:41:33,21
and here you can see the
total debt of Landsbanki.


650
0:41:33,21 --> 0:41:34,57
It changes rapidly.


651
0:41:34,57 --> 0:41:39,34
The loans and deposits
become the largest share


652
0:41:39,34 --> 0:41:42,1
of the funding structure.


653
0:41:42,1 --> 0:41:47,93
Now, as it is very risky to
extend credit out rapidly,


654
0:41:47,93 --> 0:41:52,44
it is also very risky to
collect deposits very rapidly,


655
0:41:52,44 --> 0:41:55,33
and they tend to
be not so loyal.


656
0:41:55,33 --> 0:42:0,62
And how were they ever able
to attract all these 300,000


657
0:42:0,62 --> 0:42:4,1
depositors in the UK in
less than six months?


658
0:42:4,1 --> 0:42:7,83
They basically offered
the highest rate.


659
0:42:7,83 --> 0:42:14,57
And you're not supposed to
scrutinize this regression


660
0:42:14,57 --> 0:42:15,7
analysis.


661
0:42:15,7 --> 0:42:18,43
This is very crude, and you
see that there is not very much


662
0:42:18,43 --> 0:42:23,13
variation here, but
basically we saw


663
0:42:23,13 --> 0:42:28,97
that if Landsbanki reached the
first place, as highest deposit


664
0:42:28,97 --> 0:42:34,61
rates-- they attracted about
18 million, on average, a week


665
0:42:34,61 --> 0:42:40,49
into the accounts, but if it
dropped down to fifth place,


666
0:42:40,49 --> 0:42:46,81
they lost 16 million, so
these were not very sticky.


667
0:42:46,81 --> 0:42:49,9
It's very volatile
funding, and here


668
0:42:49,9 --> 0:42:52,77
is a picture of basically outrun
on the bank that happened here


669
0:42:52,77 --> 0:42:55,95
in the early of 2008.


670
0:42:55,95 --> 0:42:57,91
There's a whole
story behind that,


671
0:42:57,91 --> 0:43:0,332
but I will leave my
book to tell you.


672
0:43:0,332 --> 0:43:2,405
AUDIENCE: Are they able
to pay those high rates


673
0:43:2,405 --> 0:43:4,357
by attracting future customers?


674
0:43:4,357 --> 0:43:6,19
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: So the
question is, are they


675
0:43:6,19 --> 0:43:7,99
able to pay those high rates?


676
0:43:7,99 --> 0:43:11,3
Well, at the end of the
day, no, of course not.


677
0:43:11,3 --> 0:43:13,21
They were run upon.


678
0:43:13,21 --> 0:43:19,61
Well, as they collecting, they
paid the interest rates, yes,


679
0:43:19,61 --> 0:43:22,959
but it was not sustainable
model, as it turned out.


680
0:43:22,959 --> 0:43:25,5
AUDIENCE: So is it sort of like
a pyramid-scheme thing, where


681
0:43:25,5 --> 0:43:25,998
by offering higher
rates, we'll get


682
0:43:25,998 --> 0:43:27,581
a lot of [INAUDIBLE]
customers, and we


683
0:43:27,581 --> 0:43:30,31
can use [INAUDIBLE] deposits,
and pay the high rate?


684
0:43:30,31 --> 0:43:31,6
[INAUDIBLE]


685
0:43:31,6 --> 0:43:33,48
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: So is it
like a Ponzi scheme, where


686
0:43:33,48 --> 0:43:40,35
you are giving up high rates
as you have the program open,


687
0:43:40,35 --> 0:43:41,83
and then you just disappear?


688
0:43:41,83 --> 0:43:45,13
Yeah, well, it was not
intended like that,


689
0:43:45,13 --> 0:43:47,99
but that is the effect of it.


690
0:43:47,99 --> 0:43:58,36
Now, as you can see here, here's
a random Icesave in April 2008,


691
0:43:58,36 --> 0:44:2,19
and at the time, the
management of Landsbanki


692
0:44:2,19 --> 0:44:4,79
reported it to the
Central Bank of Iceland


693
0:44:4,79 --> 0:44:7,28
that with this
outflow, they would


694
0:44:7,28 --> 0:44:10,92
survive for six more days.


695
0:44:10,92 --> 0:44:15,26
The Icelandic governors of
the Central Bank of Iceland


696
0:44:15,26 --> 0:44:17,55
then reported that
to the government,


697
0:44:17,55 --> 0:44:26,57
to the prime minister
and the foreign minister,


698
0:44:26,57 --> 0:44:32,74
and there was really no
reaction to this news.


699
0:44:32,74 --> 0:44:35,53
Icesave has been the
largest foreign dispute


700
0:44:35,53 --> 0:44:38,71
Iceland has had
since the Cod Wars,


701
0:44:38,71 --> 0:44:45,42
and this is an ongoing saga,
and hasn't been fully resolved,


702
0:44:45,42 --> 0:44:52,52
although the EFTA Court ruled on
whether the Icelandic state was


703
0:44:52,52 --> 0:44:57,5
liable for the deposits, or
should pay out the deposit


704
0:44:57,5 --> 0:45:0,31
insurance amount to
the foreign depositors.


705
0:45:0,31 --> 0:45:3,7



706
0:45:3,7 --> 0:45:8,33
The Court ruled in
favor of Iceland


707
0:45:8,33 --> 0:45:13,69
basically, so we have figured
out where the liability lies


708
0:45:13,69 --> 0:45:17,533
with a state or with
an insurance fund that


709
0:45:17,533 --> 0:45:19,48
has been set up, and,
in fact, in this case,


710
0:45:19,48 --> 0:45:23,31
the insurance fund is liable.


711
0:45:23,31 --> 0:45:33,44
Now, as Lehman Brothers
failed, obviously that


712
0:45:33,44 --> 0:45:35,59
proved to be an
accelerator, in terms


713
0:45:35,59 --> 0:45:39,73
of deciding the fates
of the Icelandic banks.


714
0:45:39,73 --> 0:45:42,59
After the collapse of
Lehman, the collaterals


715
0:45:42,59 --> 0:45:48,18
that had been pledged
against loans from the ECB


716
0:45:48,18 --> 0:45:53,11
fell sharply, so the ECB
started to call on the margin.


717
0:45:53,11 --> 0:46:1,32
Also, the depositors in
the UK and the Netherlands


718
0:46:1,32 --> 0:46:4,91
became uneasy, so they started
to withdraw their funds


719
0:46:4,91 --> 0:46:9,88
from the accounts, and
essentially, Landsbanki


720
0:46:9,88 --> 0:46:21,35
was run upon, and since they had
collected the Icesave deposits


721
0:46:21,35 --> 0:46:25,24
into a branch, which was
under the supervision


722
0:46:25,24 --> 0:46:28,63
of the Icelandic Financial
Supervisory Authority,


723
0:46:28,63 --> 0:46:33,83
the Brits had very
little means to step in.


724
0:46:33,83 --> 0:46:37,7
They knew that Landsbanki
was not meeting its liquidity


725
0:46:37,7 --> 0:46:41,22
requirements, because the
money was just rolling out,


726
0:46:41,22 --> 0:46:45,7
so they they found
no other option


727
0:46:45,7 --> 0:46:51,44
except for intervening
through a legal act that


728
0:46:51,44 --> 0:46:54,16
has become very
controversial in Iceland--


729
0:46:54,16 --> 0:46:57,4
the so-called Terrorist
Act, whose name is,


730
0:46:57,4 --> 0:47:2,55
in fact, Anti-Terrorism, Crime,
and Security Act of 2001.


731
0:47:2,55 --> 0:47:8,63
So the deposits of Landsbanki
were moved out of Landsbanki,


732
0:47:8,63 --> 0:47:14,77
and basically the fate of the
bank was therefore decided,


733
0:47:14,77 --> 0:47:18,62
or they had met their
fate, let's say.


734
0:47:18,62 --> 0:47:26,71
But we know now that the
banks had little chance,


735
0:47:26,71 --> 0:47:29,7
both because they were
so interconnected,


736
0:47:29,7 --> 0:47:35,99
and they had not enough
equity as a buffer


737
0:47:35,99 --> 0:47:41,87
to see any of their
assets go down in value.


738
0:47:41,87 --> 0:47:49,921
Now, basically Kaupthing met
the same fate a day later.


739
0:47:49,921 --> 0:47:51,67
The story is a little
bit different there,


740
0:47:51,67 --> 0:47:55,5
because Kaupthing adds, where
they were collecting deposits


741
0:47:55,5 --> 0:47:58,24
from the UK residents
and elsewhere, was


742
0:47:58,24 --> 0:48:0,67
done through a subsidiary.


743
0:48:0,67 --> 0:48:5,93
And this is one of the lessons
of the Icelandic episode


744
0:48:5,93 --> 0:48:11,52
is the difference between
a subsidiary and branch,


745
0:48:11,52 --> 0:48:15,55
and who is responsible for
the financial oversight.


746
0:48:15,55 --> 0:48:20,13
Now, the Brits were responsible
for the oversight in this case,


747
0:48:20,13 --> 0:48:22,76
and after Northern Rock
had failed-- first bank


748
0:48:22,76 --> 0:48:27,66
in 150 years or so
to fail in the UK--


749
0:48:27,66 --> 0:48:33,42
the supervisory authority became
quite worried that there might


750
0:48:33,42 --> 0:48:35,9
be other vulnerabilities
in their system,


751
0:48:35,9 --> 0:48:37,43
and what they
spotted immediately


752
0:48:37,43 --> 0:48:39,7
were the Icelandic banks.


753
0:48:39,7 --> 0:48:47,38
And basically the Deposit
Insurance Fund was underfunded,


754
0:48:47,38 --> 0:48:50,74
so the British
depositors acknowledged


755
0:48:50,74 --> 0:48:54,4
that in case of failure,
it would be difficult


756
0:48:54,4 --> 0:48:57,84
for them to reclaim the money.


757
0:48:57,84 --> 0:49:0,2
So in all of the
circumstances-- and obviously,


758
0:49:0,2 --> 0:49:2,37
bear in mind that
Lehman had just


759
0:49:2,37 --> 0:49:7,22
failed-- the British had seen
some movement of funds out


760
0:49:7,22 --> 0:49:13,22
of the UK over to
the US just prior


761
0:49:13,22 --> 0:49:17,64
to the collapse of Lehman, the
British authorities basically


762
0:49:17,64 --> 0:49:20,22
set up a very stringent
liquidity rule


763
0:49:20,22 --> 0:49:24,71
against Kaupthing saying,
95% of those deposits


764
0:49:24,71 --> 0:49:27,19
that you are collecting
through Kaupthing Edge--


765
0:49:27,19 --> 0:49:29,75
we need you to put
them into liquid funds,


766
0:49:29,75 --> 0:49:36,15
into treasuries and papers that
can be converted into cash very


767
0:49:36,15 --> 0:49:38,4
quickly.


768
0:49:38,4 --> 0:49:44,25
So with this rule, the
Kaupthing management


769
0:49:44,25 --> 0:49:47,45
should not have been able to
use it for their own good,


770
0:49:47,45 --> 0:49:49,13
but, in fact, they
managed to trick


771
0:49:49,13 --> 0:49:51,88
the financial supervisory
authority in the UK


772
0:49:51,88 --> 0:49:55,8
for awhile, because they
engaged in a liquidity


773
0:49:55,8 --> 0:50:0,87
swap between the parent
company and the subsidiary.


774
0:50:0,87 --> 0:50:4,4
So in essence, they counted
the money two or three times,


775
0:50:4,4 --> 0:50:8,82
so the first time around, it
was counted as liquid money.


776
0:50:8,82 --> 0:50:11,3
The second time
around it was just


777
0:50:11,3 --> 0:50:14,76
their funds, which they could
do whatever with, and including


778
0:50:14,76 --> 0:50:17,57
sending it up to Iceland
for the parent company


779
0:50:17,57 --> 0:50:20,18
to meet their margins,
or pay off their bonds,


780
0:50:20,18 --> 0:50:23,73
and so on, and so forth, and
that is exactly what happened.


781
0:50:23,73 --> 0:50:31,25
Now, on top of this, so
there were 1.1 billion pounds


782
0:50:31,25 --> 0:50:34,4
sterling engaged
in this, so missing


783
0:50:34,4 --> 0:50:38,87
from the liquidity
pool of Kaupthing.


784
0:50:38,87 --> 0:50:41,24
But on top of that,
the collateral


785
0:50:41,24 --> 0:50:46,4
that they had pledged to
the subsidiary for lending


786
0:50:46,4 --> 0:50:50,21
from the daughter company
declined in value,


787
0:50:50,21 --> 0:50:54,38
but the subsidiary
was irrespectively


788
0:50:54,38 --> 0:51:1,54
willing to extend the credit
lines by 500 million pounds,


789
0:51:1,54 --> 0:51:3,66
without taking any
collateral, and this


790
0:51:3,66 --> 0:51:8,67
the British interpreted
as siphoning money up


791
0:51:8,67 --> 0:51:12,45
through the chain of firms,
and up to the parent company.


792
0:51:12,45 --> 0:51:15,93



793
0:51:15,93 --> 0:51:21,2
And as a result, having waited
for the management of Kaupthing


794
0:51:21,2 --> 0:51:25,79
to react, the British
authorities deemed


795
0:51:25,79 --> 0:51:29,63
it necessary to take over
the Kaupthing Edge deposits


796
0:51:29,63 --> 0:51:33,42
and move them into ING,
and withdraw the bank


797
0:51:33,42 --> 0:51:36,84
license from the
[INAUDIBLE] of KSF--


798
0:51:36,84 --> 0:51:42,37
so a similar fate,
slightly different story.


799
0:51:42,37 --> 0:51:49,52
Back to Iceland, the debt-free
state-- in early 2008,


800
0:51:49,52 --> 0:51:52,74
suggestions were being made
to the Icelandic authorities


801
0:51:52,74 --> 0:51:57,14
that it should turn
to the IMF for help.


802
0:51:57,14 --> 0:51:59,52
That was after the
Central Bank of Iceland


803
0:51:59,52 --> 0:52:2,58
had tried to get credit
or foreign-exchange


804
0:52:2,58 --> 0:52:6,19
swaps with central
banks in Europe,


805
0:52:6,19 --> 0:52:8,94
and even here in
America, without success.


806
0:52:8,94 --> 0:52:12,91
And that is a signal
that is fairly decisive--


807
0:52:12,91 --> 0:52:16,78
a debt-free state unable
to get any credit anywhere.


808
0:52:16,78 --> 0:52:20,86
That should tell you
something about the situation.


809
0:52:20,86 --> 0:52:25,55
The only takers in
the FX swap market


810
0:52:25,55 --> 0:52:27,77
were the Scandinavian
central banks,


811
0:52:27,77 --> 0:52:33,62
who, in turn, put forward very
strict conditions, in exchange


812
0:52:33,62 --> 0:52:35,68
for the money swapped.


813
0:52:35,68 --> 0:52:43,0
And the conditions were at the
microeconomic management level,


814
0:52:43,0 --> 0:52:53,18
such as, the centrally
negotiated wages cannot


815
0:52:53,18 --> 0:52:56,6
increase in real terms.


816
0:52:56,6 --> 0:52:59,88
The Icelandic state cannot take
on any further debt whatsoever,


817
0:52:59,88 --> 0:53:8,93
so this is very invasive type
of debt covenance, if you will.


818
0:53:8,93 --> 0:53:13,55
And as it turned out, very
few people knew about it


819
0:53:13,55 --> 0:53:17,62
in Iceland, and the prime
minister did not even


820
0:53:17,62 --> 0:53:20,49
disclose this information
to the entire cabinet,


821
0:53:20,49 --> 0:53:27,94
and as a result, he got
indicted and brought


822
0:53:27,94 --> 0:53:32,4
before the special court in
Iceland that rules on breaches


823
0:53:32,4 --> 0:53:34,63
on the part of ministers
in Iceland-- Landsdomur,


824
0:53:34,63 --> 0:53:35,28
it's called.


825
0:53:35,28 --> 0:53:39,6
So for the first time in 100
years' history of that court,


826
0:53:39,6 --> 0:53:42,23
the case was
brought against him.


827
0:53:42,23 --> 0:53:47,34
Now, now you know how all this
happened, and why it happened.


828
0:53:47,34 --> 0:53:49,3
So the next question
is, why didn't anybody


829
0:53:49,3 --> 0:53:51,35
stop this development?


830
0:53:51,35 --> 0:53:57,27
And the short answer is, it was
too rapid of a credit growth,


831
0:53:57,27 --> 0:54:4,7
and there were too few
people to handle all of this,


832
0:54:4,7 --> 0:54:9,61
or rather, the main
cause here is, basically


833
0:54:9,61 --> 0:54:11,59
the politicians
didn't acknowledge


834
0:54:11,59 --> 0:54:15,47
the need for strong supervision.


835
0:54:15,47 --> 0:54:19,13
If you're going to build your
economic system on the pillars


836
0:54:19,13 --> 0:54:21,14
of a financial
institution's being one


837
0:54:21,14 --> 0:54:25,95
of the main industries
of the economy,


838
0:54:25,95 --> 0:54:30,53
well, you need to have
something to back it up,


839
0:54:30,53 --> 0:54:35,31
or strong oversight, and there,
the policymakers basically


840
0:54:35,31 --> 0:54:37,53
failed in Iceland.


841
0:54:37,53 --> 0:54:41,16
So we had the Financial
Supervisory Authorities


842
0:54:41,16 --> 0:54:43,44
doing financial
oversight of something


843
0:54:43,44 --> 0:54:48,92
that was 10 times the GDP of
Iceland with only 36 employees.


844
0:54:48,92 --> 0:54:52,86
And for a trained
statistician, such as myself,


845
0:54:52,86 --> 0:55:1,21
it was a shock to observe
that no proper data-analysis


846
0:55:1,21 --> 0:55:3,59
equipment were used.


847
0:55:3,59 --> 0:55:8,33
Data was gathered in
Excel sheets of 47 sheets


848
0:55:8,33 --> 0:55:11,96
from each and every
institution-- hundreds


849
0:55:11,96 --> 0:55:14,65
of small and large financial
institutions in Iceland,


850
0:55:14,65 --> 0:55:18,28
and this was the data
archiving and collection,


851
0:55:18,28 --> 0:55:21,2
so it's impossible
to have an oversight


852
0:55:21,2 --> 0:55:24,48
under these circumstances.


853
0:55:24,48 --> 0:55:29,55
So Financial Supervisory
Authorities, in short, there


854
0:55:29,55 --> 0:55:32,16
were lack of experience
and incompetence,


855
0:55:32,16 --> 0:55:33,965
lack of proper IT systems.


856
0:55:33,965 --> 0:55:39,83
Tool and processes for data
analysis weren't in place.


857
0:55:39,83 --> 0:55:41,71
There was lack of
authority and follow-up.


858
0:55:41,71 --> 0:55:45,379
Cases were kept too
informal for too long.


859
0:55:45,379 --> 0:55:46,92
Violations of the
law went unnoticed,


860
0:55:46,92 --> 0:55:49,12
and law was not enforced.


861
0:55:49,12 --> 0:55:54,47
Now, the Central Bank of Iceland
did have some more insight


862
0:55:54,47 --> 0:55:59,82
into the risk, and
also a legal obligation


863
0:55:59,82 --> 0:56:2,36
to ensure financial
stability in the country.


864
0:56:2,36 --> 0:56:4,91



865
0:56:4,91 --> 0:56:10,2
It, however, never formally
or informally conveyed it


866
0:56:10,2 --> 0:56:14,9
to the government what needed
to be done to avert the risk,


867
0:56:14,9 --> 0:56:18,65
and had it thought that they
lacked the legal means to do


868
0:56:18,65 --> 0:56:24,52
so, they did not report that
either to the government.


869
0:56:24,52 --> 0:56:29,69
Now, there were a host of
tools in the policy toolbox


870
0:56:29,69 --> 0:56:34,25
that could have been used,
but were, in fact, not.


871
0:56:34,25 --> 0:56:40,14
So one of the lessons-- and
he put it very nicely out,


872
0:56:40,14 --> 0:56:43,88
Thorarinn Petursson, senior
economist of Central Bank,


873
0:56:43,88 --> 0:56:45,94
the state of affairs in
Iceland at the time--


874
0:56:45,94 --> 0:56:48,42
"I think there is a fundamental
misunderstanding of what


875
0:56:48,42 --> 0:56:51,76
financial supervision is
all about here in Iceland.


876
0:56:51,76 --> 0:56:55,9
Not only at the FME, Financial
Supervisory Authorities,


877
0:56:55,9 --> 0:56:56,991
but also the Central Bank.


878
0:56:56,991 --> 0:56:58,99
They thought that the
role of these institutions


879
0:56:58,99 --> 0:57:1,0
was to follow upon whether
the letter of the law


880
0:57:1,0 --> 0:57:3,33
was met by those
under supervision.


881
0:57:3,33 --> 0:57:6,85
So you are watching an entire
financial system falling off


882
0:57:6,85 --> 0:57:9,4
a cliff, and as long as
you are following the law,


883
0:57:9,4 --> 0:57:11,3
you are fine."


884
0:57:11,3 --> 0:57:16,17
So one of the recommendations
of the Turner review in Britain,


885
0:57:16,17 --> 0:57:18,65
which was issued
after their crisis,


886
0:57:18,65 --> 0:57:21,6
is that the regulatory
and supervisory coverage


887
0:57:21,6 --> 0:57:24,995
should follow the principle
of economic substance, and not


888
0:57:24,995 --> 0:57:27,59
a legal form.


889
0:57:27,59 --> 0:57:31,32
Just to inform you
of the losses that


890
0:57:31,32 --> 0:57:35,44
were incurred after the
collapse, about five times


891
0:57:35,44 --> 0:57:37,9
GDP was written off in
a matter of four or five


892
0:57:37,9 --> 0:57:43,19
months after the
system collapsed,


893
0:57:43,19 --> 0:57:48,38
and these delicate findings,
or the challenges that we were


894
0:57:48,38 --> 0:57:51,56
faced in the beginning,
this special investigation


895
0:57:51,56 --> 0:57:57,31
commission ruled that on
the mistakes or negligence


896
0:57:57,31 --> 0:58:0,28
by ministers and public
officials in the period


897
0:58:0,28 --> 0:58:2,14
leading up to the
collapse of the banks,


898
0:58:2,14 --> 0:58:4,2
the SIC is in the
opinion that the Prime


899
0:58:4,2 --> 0:58:6,9
Minister, the
Minister of Finance,


900
0:58:6,9 --> 0:58:9,5
the Minister of Business
Affairs, Director


901
0:58:9,5 --> 0:58:12,93
General of the FME, governors
of the Central Bank of Iceland


902
0:58:12,93 --> 0:58:16,91
showed negligence within
the meaning of Article 1.1


903
0:58:16,91 --> 0:58:21,3
of the law on the Special
Investigation Commission.


904
0:58:21,3 --> 0:58:24,55
And as I told you before,
the prime minister


905
0:58:24,55 --> 0:58:27,75
was found guilty on one count
out of four of negligence


906
0:58:27,75 --> 0:58:30,31
by a special court, Landsdomur.


907
0:58:30,31 --> 0:58:33,14
Now, fraud or failure
on part of the bankers


908
0:58:33,14 --> 0:58:35,3
is still being decided.


909
0:58:35,3 --> 0:58:38,71
Some of them have already
received a sentence


910
0:58:38,71 --> 0:58:43,2
on a regional level
or a local court.


911
0:58:43,2 --> 0:58:45,47
Management of Kaupthing
has been sentenced


912
0:58:45,47 --> 0:58:48,9
to three to five years in
prison for fraudulent lending


913
0:58:48,9 --> 0:58:51,21
practices and
market manipulation.


914
0:58:51,21 --> 0:58:52,67
They have appealed.


915
0:58:52,67 --> 0:58:56,81
Cases are pending against the
Landsbanki management for fraud


916
0:58:56,81 --> 0:59:0,44
and market manipulation, and
Larus Welding, CEO of Glitnir,


917
0:59:0,44 --> 0:59:5,12
was found guilty, but
acquitted by the Supreme Court.


918
0:59:5,12 --> 0:59:8,22
Several other cases are
pending against him.


919
0:59:8,22 --> 0:59:13,89
The special prosecutor had
over 200 cases in total.


920
0:59:13,89 --> 0:59:16,42
58 are currently
under investigation.


921
0:59:16,42 --> 0:59:18,35
20 indictments--
15 already brought


922
0:59:18,35 --> 0:59:20,48
to court-- and eight
cases have been


923
0:59:20,48 --> 0:59:23,61
ruled upon against
46 individuals,


924
0:59:23,61 --> 0:59:27,49
so this is already exceeding
your legal efforts,


925
0:59:27,49 --> 0:59:32,18
or prosecutional efforts,
looking into savings and loans


926
0:59:32,18 --> 0:59:34,58
crisis in the '80s.


927
0:59:34,58 --> 0:59:36,13
Now, what can we learn?


928
0:59:36,13 --> 0:59:40,64



929
0:59:40,64 --> 0:59:42,99
My husband is a human
factors engineer,


930
0:59:42,99 --> 0:59:47,83
and he has taught me how the
human mind perceives things


931
0:59:47,83 --> 0:59:49,94
inadequately, and
one of the things


932
0:59:49,94 --> 0:59:55,51
is that we seem not to be
able to sense acceleration.


933
0:59:55,51 --> 0:59:58,96
We all know the story when we
are going over the speed limit,


934
0:59:58,96 --> 1:0:1,8
and we withdraw to
the legal limit,


935
1:0:1,8 --> 1:0:4,96
we find that we are
not moving at all.


936
1:0:4,96 --> 1:0:9,85
Taking this into account,
you don't put anybody


937
1:0:9,85 --> 1:0:13,1
at the seat of the F-18, is it?


938
1:0:13,1 --> 1:0:15,1
18, 19, 16?


939
1:0:15,1 --> 1:0:21,39
Thank you-- unless he or she
has several thousand hours


940
1:0:21,39 --> 1:0:22,68
in the air.


941
1:0:22,68 --> 1:0:28,3
So banks are like
monstrous machines,


942
1:0:28,3 --> 1:0:31,85
so you need people that
have the proper training


943
1:0:31,85 --> 1:0:36,27
and the proper insight, and also
at the realm of the Financial


944
1:0:36,27 --> 1:0:38,35
Supervisory Authorities.


945
1:0:38,35 --> 1:0:47,58
So that said, it
is very important


946
1:0:47,58 --> 1:0:51,73
that, as you do here
so well in America,


947
1:0:51,73 --> 1:0:56,55
acknowledging the efforts that
go into further education,


948
1:0:56,55 --> 1:1:0,86
and, yeah, that's
the aim-- to put


949
1:1:0,86 --> 1:1:3,23
the right people
at the right spot.


950
1:1:3,23 --> 1:1:7,95
But another lesson is
the importance of equity.


951
1:1:7,95 --> 1:1:11,84
These monstrous
institutions, the banks,


952
1:1:11,84 --> 1:1:16,2
are running at the
very low-equity ratio,


953
1:1:16,2 --> 1:1:18,19
so there's not much
room for their assets


954
1:1:18,19 --> 1:1:22,98
to move downwards at all.


955
1:1:22,98 --> 1:1:25,73
This is one thing-- I
mean, now in Iceland we


956
1:1:25,73 --> 1:1:30,57
have banks that are set
up, or have a funding


957
1:1:30,57 --> 1:1:35,66
mix of up to 25%
equity, and it's


958
1:1:35,66 --> 1:1:45,13
just that incentives
become very risky,


959
1:1:45,13 --> 1:1:49,56
let's say, or people
engage in risky activities,


960
1:1:49,56 --> 1:1:52,16
and it all depends on how
they are incentivized.


961
1:1:52,16 --> 1:1:55,61
So if you have your own
money in an enterprise,


962
1:1:55,61 --> 1:1:58,77
you behave very
differently from where


963
1:1:58,77 --> 1:2:5,41
you have no money of your
own in the operation.


964
1:2:5,41 --> 1:2:9,5
Another lesson is
that bankers need


965
1:2:9,5 --> 1:2:12,84
to understand that when they
are lending money in the holding


966
1:2:12,84 --> 1:2:20,71
companies, they have a
claim on the residual claim.


967
1:2:20,71 --> 1:2:24,56
So these structures that I
showed you should theoretically


968
1:2:24,56 --> 1:2:29,93
not be possible to construct,
simply because if you take


969
1:2:29,93 --> 1:2:32,28
into account that
you, the bank, you


970
1:2:32,28 --> 1:2:34,65
are lending the money
for the equity part,


971
1:2:34,65 --> 1:2:38,6
you should price it accordingly,
so there should be no money


972
1:2:38,6 --> 1:2:40,81
left on the table
for the constructors


973
1:2:40,81 --> 1:2:41,84
of these structures.


974
1:2:41,84 --> 1:2:44,49



975
1:2:44,49 --> 1:2:47,665
So pricing obviously
failed enormously


976
1:2:47,665 --> 1:2:51,37
in the Icelandic banks.


977
1:2:51,37 --> 1:2:54,62
Supervision should be built
on [INAUDIBLE] substance.


978
1:2:54,62 --> 1:2:58,7
We should try to have our
legal framework set up in a way


979
1:2:58,7 --> 1:3:3,86
that it supports
potential policies that


980
1:3:3,86 --> 1:3:8,64
need to be adjusted quickly.


981
1:3:8,64 --> 1:3:14,1
The letter of the law is
obviously fairly sticky.


982
1:3:14,1 --> 1:3:18,73
It's difficult to change
in a short period of time.


983
1:3:18,73 --> 1:3:22,64
The medium-term
effects in Iceland--


984
1:3:22,64 --> 1:3:25,72
we had massive market
manipulation on our hands.


985
1:3:25,72 --> 1:3:28,44
People were not following
the legal letter.


986
1:3:28,44 --> 1:3:33,68
They were evading the rules
and the law, so as a result,


987
1:3:33,68 --> 1:3:38,92
we have a clear case where
the markets break down.


988
1:3:38,92 --> 1:3:41,53
They just disappear, and
that is what happened.


989
1:3:41,53 --> 1:3:44,69
The bond market was
virtually non-functioning.


990
1:3:44,69 --> 1:3:47,1
Stock market
virtually disappeared.


991
1:3:47,1 --> 1:3:50,29
There was no currency
market right after the fall,


992
1:3:50,29 --> 1:3:53,654
so in de facto, we had
imposed capital controls


993
1:3:53,654 --> 1:3:55,32
right after the
collapse, because nobody


994
1:3:55,32 --> 1:3:58,63
wanted to trade the
Icelandic krona.


995
1:3:58,63 --> 1:4:0,68
So there are a lot
of small stories


996
1:4:0,68 --> 1:4:2,88
to learn from,
obviously, but I think


997
1:4:2,88 --> 1:4:6,5
if there's only one that
I can leave you with,


998
1:4:6,5 --> 1:4:12,5
it is that we know how our
system is interconnected.


999
1:4:12,5 --> 1:4:13,983
It is a question
whether you know


1000
1:4:13,983 --> 1:4:16,69
how your system
is interconnected.


1001
1:4:16,69 --> 1:4:20,48
And now I am open for questions.


1002
1:4:20,48 --> 1:4:26,3
[APPLAUSE]


1003
1:4:26,3 --> 1:4:27,766
So to answer your
question, which


1004
1:4:27,766 --> 1:4:29,39
was along the lines
that, what happened


1005
1:4:29,39 --> 1:4:30,69
to the Icelandic people?


1006
1:4:30,69 --> 1:4:33,63
How many are unemployed,
and so on, and so forth.


1007
1:4:33,63 --> 1:4:37,31
The short answer is, we had
a spike in the unemployment


1008
1:4:37,31 --> 1:4:41,27
rate reaching 8%, 9%.


1009
1:4:41,27 --> 1:4:44,5
It has come down to
4%, roughly, now.


1010
1:4:44,5 --> 1:4:47,68
So we have had a history of very
low unemployment in Iceland.


1011
1:4:47,68 --> 1:4:50,35
I mean, most of us had
three or three or four jobs,


1012
1:4:50,35 --> 1:4:57,2
like you saw on my
profile, but Iceland


1013
1:4:57,2 --> 1:5:0,4
has been portrayed, like
here in the US media,


1014
1:5:0,4 --> 1:5:4,12
as a poster child of economic
recovery after the crisis.


1015
1:5:4,12 --> 1:5:5,82
But I have to tell
you, unfortunately,


1016
1:5:5,82 --> 1:5:10,95
that the judges haven't
ruled on it yet.


1017
1:5:10,95 --> 1:5:13,84
We have still got the most
challenge on our hand,


1018
1:5:13,84 --> 1:5:15,51
and that is to get
rid of the capital


1019
1:5:15,51 --> 1:5:18,15
controls that were
installed right after.


1020
1:5:18,15 --> 1:5:20,73
So, for example, if you're
traveling abroad from Iceland,


1021
1:5:20,73 --> 1:5:26,6
you can only bring $3,000
or so for your rental car


1022
1:5:26,6 --> 1:5:28,3
and your hotel, and
so on, and so forth,


1023
1:5:28,3 --> 1:5:29,89
so it's being sanctioned.


1024
1:5:29,89 --> 1:5:32,37
Currency is being sanctioned.


1025
1:5:32,37 --> 1:5:38,43
So net foreign direct
investment is at a historic low.


1026
1:5:38,43 --> 1:5:40,7
Investment, in
general, is very low,


1027
1:5:40,7 --> 1:5:42,56
so people are seeing
their wages have


1028
1:5:42,56 --> 1:5:46,52
been cut in half in real terms.


1029
1:5:46,52 --> 1:5:49,2
Even nominal terms
have been lowered.


1030
1:5:49,2 --> 1:5:51,88



1031
1:5:51,88 --> 1:5:54,81
Government officials,
for example,


1032
1:5:54,81 --> 1:5:57,26
haven't seen a raise
in eight years,


1033
1:5:57,26 --> 1:6:1,84
so this is a big chunk of
a person's life's work,


1034
1:6:1,84 --> 1:6:9,294
or of career, so we are
not part of the woods yet.


1035
1:6:9,294 --> 1:6:10,21
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].


1036
1:6:10,21 --> 1:6:12,91
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: They
were primarily the loans


1037
1:6:12,91 --> 1:6:18,188
to holding companies that
were just foam, or they were--


1038
1:6:18,188 --> 1:6:19,771
AUDIENCE: The holding
companies didn't


1039
1:6:19,771 --> 1:6:20,58
want to be [INAUDIBLE], or what?


1040
1:6:20,58 --> 1:6:22,23
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Yeah, they did.


1041
1:6:22,23 --> 1:6:26,35
The majority of them held the
stocks of the banks themselves,


1042
1:6:26,35 --> 1:6:30,92
who became bankrupt, and then
you had all this domino effect.


1043
1:6:30,92 --> 1:6:35,0
Most firms in Iceland have
become technically bankrupt.


1044
1:6:35,0 --> 1:6:37,17
That has been the
most challenge that we


1045
1:6:37,17 --> 1:6:40,55
have been faced with after
the crash is to reorganize


1046
1:6:40,55 --> 1:6:44,44
and restructure the loan
portfolios of the banks,


1047
1:6:44,44 --> 1:6:50,435
because more than every
other loan of the portfolios


1048
1:6:50,435 --> 1:6:54,16
of the banks were nonperforming.


1049
1:6:54,16 --> 1:6:58,29
That's a very good question
on how we kept politics out


1050
1:6:58,29 --> 1:7:1,52
of the reporting on the
failures of the banks.


1051
1:7:1,52 --> 1:7:2,48
That's your question?


1052
1:7:2,48 --> 1:7:3,565
AUDIENCE: More or less.


1053
1:7:3,565 --> 1:7:5,34
I mean, we can't do that here.


1054
1:7:5,34 --> 1:7:7,71
How did you do it there?


1055
1:7:7,71 --> 1:7:10,95
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: I think that you
might see different reactions


1056
1:7:10,95 --> 1:7:12,68
on part of your
politicians if you


1057
1:7:12,68 --> 1:7:16,57
had your 97% of your
banking sector collapse.


1058
1:7:16,57 --> 1:7:19,19
It's just such a severity
of the situation that


1059
1:7:19,19 --> 1:7:23,16
did not allow for any scrutiny.


1060
1:7:23,16 --> 1:7:24,89
I mean, you can
wonder about reasons


1061
1:7:24,89 --> 1:7:26,67
why the politicians,
for example,


1062
1:7:26,67 --> 1:7:29,34
extended this type
of data access.


1063
1:7:29,34 --> 1:7:32,24
I mean, this is unheard of
that the one government that


1064
1:7:32,24 --> 1:7:36,85
has failed so miserably in
their policy making actually


1065
1:7:36,85 --> 1:7:39,39
brings on themselves
an investigation where


1066
1:7:39,39 --> 1:7:41,895
they can be exposed, and that
is exactly what happened.


1067
1:7:41,895 --> 1:7:45,4



1068
1:7:45,4 --> 1:7:47,85
But you've got to applaud
this type of behavior


1069
1:7:47,85 --> 1:7:49,19
on part of the politicians.


1070
1:7:49,19 --> 1:7:53,8



1071
1:7:53,8 --> 1:7:56,18
We're a small society.


1072
1:7:56,18 --> 1:8:0,34
We were a trusting bunch
before the collapse,


1073
1:8:0,34 --> 1:8:5,96
and one of the guests that
I had in the audience at one


1074
1:8:5,96 --> 1:8:8,12
of the financial
institutions pointed out


1075
1:8:8,12 --> 1:8:11,38
that you need a healthy dose
of mistrust in any system,


1076
1:8:11,38 --> 1:8:13,29
and that was lacking.


1077
1:8:13,29 --> 1:8:15,83
The mistrust was not
enough, but now we


1078
1:8:15,83 --> 1:8:25,6
swung from the totally trusting
system over to a full mistrust.


1079
1:8:25,6 --> 1:8:29,97
So there was a lot of scrutiny
on part of the public.


1080
1:8:29,97 --> 1:8:33,25
Obviously we had a pots
and pans revolution,


1081
1:8:33,25 --> 1:8:35,0
where people were
banging on pots and pans


1082
1:8:35,0 --> 1:8:36,84
in front of Parliament,
so that was not


1083
1:8:36,84 --> 1:8:43,49
much room for politicians
to try to cast sand


1084
1:8:43,49 --> 1:8:47,13
into the eyes of
the voting public.


1085
1:8:47,13 --> 1:8:48,729
In terms of incentives,
the question


1086
1:8:48,729 --> 1:8:51,6
was, what type of
prisons do you have,


1087
1:8:51,6 --> 1:8:56,1
where people involved in this
sentence of guilty verdict--


1088
1:8:56,1 --> 1:8:59,29
where can they expect
themselves to end up?


1089
1:8:59,29 --> 1:9:7,359
And one answer is, the length
of the sentences in Iceland


1090
1:9:7,359 --> 1:9:11,17
are very short, so
as it turns out,


1091
1:9:11,17 --> 1:9:13,3
we have had one case
of insider trading


1092
1:9:13,3 --> 1:9:16,399
that has been ruled upon,
and the person involved


1093
1:9:16,399 --> 1:9:20,529
has gone to jail for
six months total.


1094
1:9:20,529 --> 1:9:22,399
The sentence was two years.


1095
1:9:22,399 --> 1:9:24,6
If you behave well
in the prison,


1096
1:9:24,6 --> 1:9:26,66
you can get your sentence
halved, and then you


1097
1:9:26,66 --> 1:9:33,27
can do community service for
half of the remaining part,


1098
1:9:33,27 --> 1:9:42,34
so in this particular
instance, the expected value


1099
1:9:42,34 --> 1:9:45,81
was positive, so--


1100
1:9:45,81 --> 1:9:47,81
AUDIENCE: And the conditions
themselves are bad?


1101
1:9:47,81 --> 1:9:49,6
GUDRUN JOHNSEN: Oh, very nice.


1102
1:9:49,6 --> 1:9:51,18
[LAUGHTER]


1103
1:9:51,18 --> 1:9:54,27
You need to be trained to
understand acceleration


1104
1:9:54,27 --> 1:9:55,97
and growth and what it means.


1105
1:9:55,97 --> 1:9:59,33
Lawyers, for example, are
not trained in this way.


1106
1:9:59,33 --> 1:10:8,79
But the explanations need to be
sought in the behavioral part,


1107
1:10:8,79 --> 1:10:12,82
and in small society,
there's a big hurdle effect.


1108
1:10:12,82 --> 1:10:14,77
People were just cheering
for those bankers,


1109
1:10:14,77 --> 1:10:18,84
and the government officials
and the political leaders


1110
1:10:18,84 --> 1:10:22,1
were applauding the
people who were in charge,


1111
1:10:22,1 --> 1:10:28,7
and so we basically
risked being ridiculed,


1112
1:10:28,7 --> 1:10:33,11
and I was certainly one of those
who had been doing research


1113
1:10:33,11 --> 1:10:35,76
on credit growth especially.


1114
1:10:35,76 --> 1:10:39,58
I pointed it out a year and a
half before the banks failed,


1115
1:10:39,58 --> 1:10:42,78
and to tell you the truth,
there was no reaction to it


1116
1:10:42,78 --> 1:10:48,2
whatsoever, so
that's how that was.


1117
1:10:48,2 --> 1:10:50,43
Right, so what are the
capital controls that


1118
1:10:50,43 --> 1:10:53,29
are in place, and what
are they meant to prevent?


1119
1:10:53,29 --> 1:10:57,87
So they are meant to prevent a
capital outflow of the country,


1120
1:10:57,87 --> 1:11:5,52
so if there are claims on the
bankrupt estates, for one,


1121
1:11:5,52 --> 1:11:10,93
there are also foreign investors
who own ISK-denominated bonds.


1122
1:11:10,93 --> 1:11:13,5
They want to get
rid of their krona,


1123
1:11:13,5 --> 1:11:16,84
and buy foreign exchange for
it, and leave the economy,


1124
1:11:16,84 --> 1:11:20,73
and if people do
that massively, you


1125
1:11:20,73 --> 1:11:23,68
have a run on the
bank situation.


1126
1:11:23,68 --> 1:11:25,79
So you want to prevent
that to happen,


1127
1:11:25,79 --> 1:11:28,95
because if you allow that,
the currency of the krona


1128
1:11:28,95 --> 1:11:32,98
will devalue, and most
of mortgages in Iceland,


1129
1:11:32,98 --> 1:11:36,14
because we have had a history of
high inflation in our economy,


1130
1:11:36,14 --> 1:11:39,2
they are index-linked,
so they're


1131
1:11:39,2 --> 1:11:40,73
linked to the CPI index.


1132
1:11:40,73 --> 1:11:45,3
So if foreigners leave
rapidly, the system-- the krona


1133
1:11:45,3 --> 1:11:48,41
devalues, and, for example,
debt of corporates,


1134
1:11:48,41 --> 1:11:53,86
as well as households,
will increase, as a result.


1135
1:11:53,86 --> 1:11:57,81
So you will have a turbulence--
probably nonperforming loans,


1136
1:11:57,81 --> 1:12:0,7
et cetera, so turbulence
in the financial sector.


1137
1:12:0,7 --> 1:12:4,87
Financial instability is what
