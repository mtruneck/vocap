###8 - Deep within the far reaches of the universe, in a galaxy
###15 not yet known to us humans, lived a tiny and complex
###21 creature, Lil Bub.
###26 [INSTRUMENTAL SPACE MUSIC]
###30 One day, Bub decided to leave her planet and venture off
###38 into the darkness of space.

###62 LARA SPENCER: All right, here we go.
###63 It is finally time to meet Bub, a kitten born the runt of
###67 the litter, who is now the toast of the internet.
###69 Yeah, she's toothless, stubby-legged, extra-toed and,
###72 perhaps, I dare say, the cutest cat in the world.
###74 - This is a normal cat's pelvis.
###76 This is Bub's pelvis.
###78 A normal cat would have nice, straight bones that have a
###82 darker marrow cavity, compared to Bub.
###85 There's no marrow cavity, and, of course, there's no twisting
###90 and deformity of the bones.
###92 [INSTRUMENTAL PASTORAL MUSIC]
###98 - I got Bub, because I thought she was amazing.
###102 I took her home.
###103 I posted pictures of her on the internet.
###105 And then that one photo just, like, blew up.
###109 [CURSOR CLICKING]
###110 - Everything in my life was really awful, and then it got
###113 pretty cool.
###114 [INSTRUMENTAL SPACE MUSIC]
###116 - There was a lot of cute cat videos of normal cats doing
###119 cute things.
###119 But, like, this is, like, an incredibly unique cat doing
###123 weird things.
###125 - If we look at human life through a cat's eyes, does so
###129 much of what we do seem futile?
###131 - If there's going to be half a decade for crazy cat people
###135 to come out of the closet, then let it be now.
