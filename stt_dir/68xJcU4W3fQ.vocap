###0 [PUNK MUSIC]
###43 -Tom Burt.
###44 Where's Tom?
###45 Is he still here?
###45 He had to catch a flight.
###48 [INAUDIBLE] you out there?
###51 Shawn, you want to--
###52 Yeah, come on up, Shawn.
###53 Shawn, you were out there taking runs, getting in
###55 people's ways and stuff.
###56 You should have two shirts.
###59 Shawn Farmer-- two shirts for being out there.
###63 Wasn't in the competition, but he was in the pipe.
###67 DAVE SEOANE: Farmer definitely goes through stages where he,
###69 like, takes care of himself.
###71 And he--
###75 this is kind of a hard one-- but today, he's like, I would
###78 totally quit drinking if I had a reason to.
###80 Like, if I had a girl that I was totally in love with, I
###82 would probably quit drinking, but I don't really have a
###85 reason to quit drinking.
###86 That was pretty heavy.
###90 Because when he drinks, he is not afraid.
###93 And it's actually kind of scary.
###94 He turns into this caveman.
###96 And you can't, you can't--
###98 you're like, Farm.
###99 And he's like a dog.
###100 And you have to say, Farmer-- you can't talk to him and be
###103 reasonable.
###103 You have to say, Farmer, sit, now.
###105 And he'll, like, OK.
###108 Definitely got to be careful about crossing the line.
###111 SHAWN FARMER: These [INAUDIBLE] wool pants from
###113 the army store.
###115 A pair of Sorels, right?
###118 You know when your feet hurt too bad from the pair of
###121 Sorels If you could get a pair [INAUDIBLE] liners, you were
###125 like, Jesus Christ on a fucking popsicle stick.
###129 Right?
###132 That's why we're here, man, today, because we were here
###140 back then, man.
###142 -Back then?
###144 SHAUN WHITE: Dude, one of the first times I met Farmer was
###149 at the "My Way" premiere video.
###151 It was Arnette's video.
###153 And he showed up with, like, fur boots and some bondage
###158 weird gear like this, with a leash on his girlfriend in the
###162 same sort of getup.
###164 And I'm just like who is this guy?
###166 Like, he's so unreal, and he's never been afraid to go the
###172 distance for anything.
###173 And he's a great guy.
###174 He's just, like, way into snowboarding, way into the
###178 back country.
###179 SHAWN FARMER: My house is super trashed, man.
###183 Because I've just been on the go lately.
###185 
###195 I've got shit everywhere.
###196 
###203 Let me scoop some of this up.
###205 
###218 I have one plastic cup-- probably because I don't have
###220 any glasses.
###221 
###224 I had one glass.
###225 I have one plastic cup.
###228 I've got that going for me.
###230 If someone wants to stay with me, they can stay with me.
###233 I've told people all winter come up and stay, and, like,
###236 nobody came and stayed with me, dude, except for the guys
###239 I work with.
###242 It's like an emergency thing for the guys that I work with.
###244 Because we plow snow and sometimes if it snows really
###246 bad, then they don't have to drive home to Reno.
###249 They can, like, stay up here.
###251 And so I'm just like a house man--
###254 guy---
###254 house mom, I guess.
###256 I'm not a very good house mom, but yeah.
###260 But I've been telling my friends, man, come up.
###262 I have a room.
###263 The beds are all made and ready for you.
###265 
###268 JERRY DUGAN: You know, Sean Farmer's an interesting
###271 individual on so many levels.
###273 He's super high-functioning intelligent and a total idiot
###277 at the same time.
###279 I love the guy with my whole heart.
###281 And he's super creative, super talented, and is completely
###288 ADD, as I am.
###290 So he's just all over the board.
###292 SHAWN FARMER: The boot drier.
###294 The boot drier I made.
###297 It goes together like this so you can, like,
###299 transport it, you know?
###300 You put this blow dryer on here like this.
###303 
###306 It's rad.
###308 Sick, huh?
###310 Then you put your boots in.
###314 You put your boots in there.
###315 
###319 You put this in your boots, you know, and then your gloves
###322 on top of here.
###324 It totally kicks out the heat, man, like in 10 minutes.
###327 10 minutes, you're good.
###330 -You should patent that.
###331 SHAWN FARMER: It's so bad ass.
###332 It's probably a fire hazard and everything.
###334 I want to get a timer for it so you can just set it for,
###336 like, 10 minutes or 20 minutes.
###338 Because, you know, have you ever seen those boot dryers
###339 that don't do anything?
###340 Like, what is this?
###342 It blows, like, room temperature air on there?
###344 And you're like, what the fuck is that?
###346 What you want is, like, when you come out-- when you get
###348 your boots out of your car because you forgot and left
###350 them in and they're frozen solid?
###351 You put that thing on there.
###353 And I swear to god in 10 minutes, 15 minutes
###355 tops, it's bone dry.
###357 Shit is just steaming hot.
###358 
###363 Maybe I should get a different shirt.
###365 -I just wanted to know how you got into snowboarding, because
###368 where are you from, originally?
###369 SHAWN FARMER: Missouri.
###370 -Where at?
###371 SHAWN FARMER: Missoura.
###373 Jefferson City.
###374 Some people say Missoura.
###375 Some people say Missouri, you know?
###377 No, it's Jefferson City, Missoura.
###378 I just got on a thing-- you know, whatever.
###380 It's just a stunt.
###381 It's something to do for, like, first for the actual--
###384 yeah, I got on what we call the snowboard at the time.
###388 One of my buddies even had one of those Sims ones.
###390 It's like a plastic tray kind of thing.
###392 You bolt your skateboard deck to it.
###394 But I mean, we just did that because it was wintertime and
###397 you couldn't really skateboard.
###400 And we thought it was cool.
###401 At one point, I graduated from high school.
###403 I went to college for one semester, and I was just like
###406 pretty much not into it.
###408 I mean, I got OK grades, and I was like, I want to go ski.
###413 The idea was skiing.
###414 It wasn't even snowboarding.
###415 I was like, I was going to ski out in Colorado.
###417 I was like, I'll take a semester off, or a year off,
###420 and go mess around out there and ski.
###423 And then I went out there.
###424 And then I saw a snowboard video.
###426 I think it was called "One Track Mind," or something.
###429 It was an old Burton one.
###431 Once I saw that, I was just like, I skateboard.
###434 I'm getting one of those.
###435 Me and my buddy, Joey [INAUDIBLE], we went to Wave
###437 Rave in Boulder.
###440 And we had like our whole paychecks for the week.
###442 And we bought the only two snowboards they had in that
###445 store, which was two Burton Elite--
###450 yeah, Performer Elites with no high backs.
###452 That was '85, '86.
###454 And so by the end of season-- well, no ski
###456 areas allowed it, really.
###458 We had to go to Berthoud Pass so that we could snowboard.
###463 That was the only place.
###464 Berthoud Pass would allow snowboarding.
###466 Not Summit County, not Breckenridge, no nothing,
###470 until like halfway through the season.
###471 Then they converted it.
###472 Then they had the world championships in the spring.
###474 They did a complete 180.
###476 So then I started riding at Breckenridge.
###479 And by the time it was time for like the world
###482 championships, I was pretty decent.
###485 Because everyone no one around there could like--
###487 you couldn't ride unless you hiked or
###490 went to Berthoud Pass.
###491 So I was in the mix pretty quick.
###494 My name's Shawn Farmer.
###496 I've been snowboarding about five or 10 years.
###499 And it's pretty much all I do.
###503 MIKE HATCHETT: Yeah.
###503 Farmer's always been pretty much Farm.
###505 He's a really amazing guy.
###507 He's got a really unique personality.
###510 And if he's on your good side--
###512 I mean if you're on his good side, it's a good thing.
###515 And we pretty much clicked right off the bat, my brother
###517 and I and Shawn.
###518 And he's been my friend ever since.
###520 And some people would say he's kind of crazy in certain ways,
###524 and on a snowboard, definitely.
###526 SHAWN FARMER: I was living in Colorado at the time.
###528 And I was doing a little contest circuit a little bit.
###530 And I was not really into it, because we'd go in the
###533 backcountry and kind of take pictures.
###534 And we always looked cool.
###536 And then I'd go to these events and they had such a--
###539 the stuff was not that cool.
###540 The half pipes were horrible.
###542 And once and a while, I could throw a backflip or do
###544 something pretty rad, but I was never
###545 consistent in a half pipe.
###547 And I just wasn't into the contest scene.
###551 And then I went to the Mount Baker Bank Slalom is what it
###554 was in Washington.
###557 I got second place in the event the first time I ever
###559 went, and then--
###561 behind Craig Kelly.
###564 Anyway, I got from Colorado to Washington.
###567 And snowed like 5 feet.
###570 I don't know.
###571 It just snows and snows and snows up there.
###573 And I was riding with Craig Kelly.
###574 And I was like, is this how it is all the time up here?
###576 And he's like, yeah, pretty much.
###578 And I was like, rad.
###579 So next year I moved there.
###581 Baker's got just crazy steeps, and it dumps there.
###586 MIKE HATCHETT: He was living in Baker at one point.
###588 And he just was one of the first guys to really nail
###590 [INAUDIBLE] lines and just charge the steeps.
###592 And he was super, super gutsy on a snowboard.
###596 He would just go huge.
###599 PAT BRIDGES: Yeah, Shawn Farmer came in and--
###601 
###604 you got to understand, in, like, 1990, 1991, while
###608 everybody--
###608 and I mean everybody--
###610 who was making a living off of snowboarding was competing, a
###615 small group of guys, as opposed to competing, they cut
###619 down on their contest regimen.
###621 Instead of doing one a month, they decided to do two a year.
###625 And they started filming.
###626 And they saw that this is a way to take a sport that's
###631 cold, remote, and bring it to the masses.
###636 SHAWN FARMER: But to rewind little bit, Nick Perata, I met
###639 him when I was competing and touring around Colorado.
###643 At one point a buddy of his-- they were from LA.
###646 One of his buddies was from LA.
###647 And he was into filming, 16 millimeter.
###649 And they started making this movie.
###651 And they were just like, hey, do you want
###652 to be in this movie?
###653 And I'm like, cool, let's do the movie.
###655 So I mean, it's sort of a blur.
###657 It was like the Hatchett brothers, Nick Perata, our
###662 buddy Jeff--
###665 this Jeff dude from--
###667 I can't remember his last name right now.
###669 Whatever.
###669 We just started making this movie, man, "Totally Board 1."
###673 MIKE HATCHETT: It was our first film.
###674 And we really didn't have--
###676 the concept wasn't out there of shooting dudes' segments on
###681 this certain person.
###681 There was no real set formula.
###683 Those guys were our bros.
###684 And they were available to shoot.
###686 And we decided to commit a whole winter to it.
###688 Basically was just Nick, Dave, and Shawn were the main stars
###692 of that movie.
###693 SHAWN FARMER: I mean I did some cool stuff.
###695 I jumped the Mount Baker road gap--
###699 that I'd heard talked about forever.
###701 But I never saw any pictures of it.
###704 So I was just like, right here, right here?
###706 This is it?
###706 OK.
###707 Let's got up there and do that.
###708 MIKE HATCHETT: He was definitely one of the
###710 ballsiest snowboarders back in that day in '88, '89, '90.
###716 We we're driving up to Baker to shoot.
###718 And we were like, that looks like a place you
###719 could jump the road.
###720 We just built a kicker and Shawn jumped it and didn't
###723 really think that much of it.
###725 SHAWN FARMER: I almost got hurt on that a couple times,
###727 just on the in run, coming in, like, fell down, like,
###731 directly over the road.
###732 The snow just dumped off, and I was like, oh my god, but did
###736 it again and pulled that pretty clean.
###739 MIKE RANQUET: I remember I was sitting on the road drinking
###742 beers, just going, what a fucking nut bag.
###745 And he kept coming over.
###748 He was like, hey Ranquet, I'm going to do it
###751 with my shirt off.
###752 You know, peels his shirt off.
###754 He's just cut.
###754 I'm like, what are you doing?
###756 And he pulled it, just did this sweet kicked out method
###759 air and landed it.
###760 Didn't even eat shit like I expected--
###763 wanted him to.
###765 SHAWN FARMER: Jeff Tulloch, he did it to.
###766 I don't think anyone even knows that he did it.
###768 But he did it too.
###769 MIKE HATCHETT: Shawn had to duck under this tree branch
###771 right before the in run, because it was low.
###773 I'm sure someone hacked it off with a tree saw by now.
###775 But it was just a small branch going across the in run.
###778 But of course, back in the day, we didn't think about
###780 doing stuff like that.
###782 I would never cut a tree branch down either.
###785 SHAWN FARMER: I think I was the first one to hit that.
###786 Now guys--
###787 I did a method over it.
###788 Now guys are doing rodeos and who knows what over it.
###792 Plus, they build a cheese wedge that's six feet high.
###795 I mean, we built like-- for us a kicker was like,
###799 OK, we got a kicker.
###801 Stomp on that little bit.
###802 That was it.
###805 And then we got to go to Alaska.
###807 I don't know.
###807 All this stuff happened in a short period of time.
###812 I was in Colorado.
###813 I was riding Sims boards.
###815 Then I was in Washington.
###817 Next thing I knew, I was on G&S boards.
###820 Because what happened was, I went from Washington to Tahoe
###823 to film some more after we filmed all spring and winter.
###827 And then we got sent that summer to Alaska with K2, just
###831 because, hey, you want to be on K2?
###832 We'll pay you.
###833 And I go, OK.
###834 The K2 thing was probably my best run.
###837 And then we just started jumping off
###838 stuff up there in Alaska.
###840 They dropped us off on a glacier with an airplane.
###845 We're flying in on the airplane
###846 looking up at the mountain.
###847 It's like you're down in here in the airplane.
###849 Here's this face.
###850 And you're going, [WHINING SOUND].
###852 You're looking up at this rock wall, just going, damn.
###857 And then we got dropped off with a bunch of, like, free
###860 heel ski gear and a bunch of crampons and backpacks.
###866 I didn't know nothing about any of that stuff-- a bunch of
###868 dried food and stuff.
###870 Luckily the people that were with us were organized enough
###873 to get the good stuff.
###874 And the North Face, we had all the North Face gear--
###877 North Face tents, North Face bags.
###879 And just started climbing this mountain, the Moose's Tooth,
###882 which is 9,000.
###883 Doesn't sound like a lot, but up there, 9,000 is like 9,000,
###887 you know what I mean?
###888 It's like 8,000 feet above the glaciers.
###891 So you're up there.
###892 We were definitely some of the first snowboarders to get
###895 recognition for going up there, and certainly probably
###899 one of only a handful of people from the lower 48, as
###903 they call it, to go up there and do that stuff.
###905 My other buddies were from Alaska, so they were dinking
###908 around and getting in some hellies.
###910 But we were some of the first guys, probably out of a
###914 handful of five people--
###916 maybe Zellers and Burt and me and Nick and Pappas were the
###920 first guys to do it, really, for sure.
###924 Well it was "Totally Board" and then Hatchett worked for
###930 Fall Line Films one year.
###933 JERRY DUGAN: Shawn Farmer came into the scene in "Critical
###935 Condition," which would have been our third film.
###937 And he had worked with--
###941 it was the original "Totally Board." And it got a little
###943 bit of play, and then kind of disappeared off the map.
###946 And that year, Hatchett came to work for me.
###950 Farmer, who was working with them, really had no film
###953 company to go to.
###954 So he called me and just was like pretty much the cockiest
###959 asshole you ever would have met.
###960 He was just like, dude, your film needs me.
###963 I'm like, what do you mean my film need you?
###964 He's like, dude, no one's doing the kind
###966 of stuff I'm doing.
###967 You need me in your film.
###969 And he just wouldn't stop calling.
###971 At some point, I'm just like, dude, come on.
###972 I saw your film.
###973 I saw you do some stuff in it.
###975 Yeah, you're OK.
###976 But you've kind of got this ape-like style.
###977 And you're kind of Cro-Magnon.
###980 And he just kept calling.
###982 SHAWN FARMER: They called me, man.
###984 That part is bullshit.
###986 "Farmer called us." They called me, or they at least,
###990 like, put the word out.
###993 I was just like, OK, these guys want to do it.
###996 I'm available.
###998 Point the camera at me.
###1000 They wanted to put me on the map.
###1003 JERRY DUGAN: Finally that's where we
###1004 came up with the thing.
###1004 It was like, fine, dude.
###1005 Put up or shut up.
###1007 We sent him a bus ticket because he was stuck in Utah.
###1009 He couldn't get out to Tahoe.
###1010 He couldn't get himself here to film.
###1012 So I was like fine.
###1013 We sent him a bus ticket and said, put up or shut up.
###1016 You're talking all this smack.
###1017 Back it up.
###1018 SHAWN FARMER: You know, I think it's basically pretty
###1021 close to the truth.
###1023 I don't remember riding the bus.
###1026 I think I might have bought my own plane ticket.
###1028 I think they said they'd buy me a plane ticket.
###1030 And I was like, fuck you guys.
###1032 I'll just buy my own fucking plane ticket.
###1035 And so I came out.
###1036 And then we came out of the bus station or whatever.
###1041 Anyway, there was some argument.
###1043 There was definitely some argument or issue there.
###1047 JERRY DUGAN: And I think he pretty much lived with me on
###1049 off for two or three years after that point.
###1054 Sponsorship and him were a really tough animal to sort of
###1057 cohabitate together.
###1058 He was a very outspoken and not always
###1066 controllable commodity.
###1067 And he's got a million things and a million ideas and a
###1070 million things he wants to do.
###1071 And when he gets something in his head, he just doesn't
###1073 really let it rest until he gets it out and does it.
###1078 And that was kind of like his rap.
###1081 He wanted to be a rap star, not just a snowboard star.
###1083 He wanted to be a rap star too.
###1085 So we gave him a shot at it.
###1089 [MUSIC - SHAWN FARMER, "FARMER'S RAP"]
###1090 
###1094 SHAWN FARMER: I think I just kept hammering on Jerry and
###1096 going, man, I want to make a video.
###1098 I want to make a rap video.
###1099 I want to make a song.
###1099 I got this song, you know?
###1102 He's like, fine, let's do it.
###1104 And luckily, he had this buddy who could loop.
###1107 As soon as I heard that people were looping beats, I was like
###1110 man, you take a song that's already a hit
###1113 and sing on it again?
###1116 How can you go wrong, unless you're a total retard?
###1120 I was like, here's what I want to do.
###1122 I want to take this Doors lick.
###1124 And don't ask me how they got away with that or what the
###1128 hell they did, if they settled.
###1129 I have no idea.
###1131 JERRY DUGAN: My original partner in my first company
###1134 with Artie was this guy named Kendrick Wells.
###1137 And he was an old friend of mine I grew up with in Marin.
###1140 And he had a little recording studio and
###1143 recorded some rappers.
###1145 He was one of Tupac's really good friends.
###1147 And he worked with Farmer and myself to come up with that
###1150 first song.
###1151 SHAWN FARMER: I was loaded one day and dropped a 40 in the
###1154 studio and broke it all over all the wires and everything.
###1158 That was the kind of stuff I did.
###1160 But we got it done.
###1161 And then I think I did one take, I know
###1164 not more than two.
###1165 I was just like, man, I feel it right now.
###1168 But if you keep making me do this over
###1170 and over, I'll just--
###1172 I think we did one take and a couple overdubs, and that was
###1175 it, and a couple of punch tracks.
###1178 JERRY DUGAN: Those were the old days before we knew you
###1179 could attach cameras.
###1180 I think I just pretty much hung out on the hood.
###1183 It was back old school style before I knew about cool
###1186 mounts and fancy rigging and grips and gaffers.
###1189 You can get a lot more done in life sometimes before you know
###1191 how to do it.
###1193 You just do it, and it kind of works.
###1196 SHAWN FARMER: So I knew that would work.
###1198 And whether it's a hit or not, I don't care.
###1200 But people like it.
###1201 I dig it.
###1202 And I thought it came out pretty good.
###1205 They did a good job.
###1206 And I think they did pretty awesome production.
###1209 Back then, that year, that movie was the shit.
###1212 It was like, yeah, at the trade show or whatever.
###1216 JERRY DUGAN: There's very few people I've been as impressed
###1218 with as him.
###1219 He is one of the ballsiest technicians I've ever met.
###1223 We'll be on the ground.
###1226 We'll be back at the barbie angles.
###1227 We used to call it the barbecue angle.
###1228 And he'll look at a line-- he's like, I'm going to make
###1230 two turns, I'm going to pop off here, jump 20 feet, land
###1232 on that patch right there, you know, 15-foot patch of snow,
###1235 get it together and then pop off that 50-footer.
###1238 And I'm like, OK have fun.
###1241 I'll be down here.
###1242 I've got the angle.
###1243 You go.
###1243 And he'll go up there and he'll just fricking do it
###1245 every time.
###1246 It's just, his awareness of where he was in spatial
###1249 relationship to the mountains, the snow, and his ability to
###1252 get himself to where he said was hands down better than
###1257 almost everyone, except, I'd say, like, Tom Burt.
###1262 DAMIAN SANDERS: Farmer was bad ass.
###1263 He was like a bear.
###1265 He was almost like a biker.
###1267 He was a big guy.
###1267 He had all that crazy hair.
###1268 But he was just funny.
###1270 He was hilarious back in the days.
###1272 We had so much fun riding together-- a
###1274 hell of a lot of talent.
###1275 He could ride steep cliffs and big jumps
###1278 like nobody's business.
###1279 He was like a Tom Burt-style rider.
###1280 Those guys were kind of in the same world.
###1283 TOM BURT: Farmer was kind of a loose cannon rider.
###1288 He kind of did a little bit of everything, but
###1291 mostly he free rode.
###1292 So he rode kind of big mountains.
###1296 But he also did tricks and airs and
###1299 stupid stunts and things.
###1302 But he was actually real progressive.
###1303 He was doing back flips to fakie.
###1307 He was the first person I ever saw do anything with that.
###1311 Pretty early on, the only other kind of guy landing
###1314 fakie was Ranquet at that time.
###1318 But he brought another character to the sport.
###1324 SHAWN FARMER: I still think the "Critical Condition"
###1325 part's probably my best thing.
###1328 I had a lot of delusions of grandeur and stuff, and just
###1331 get sidetracked.
###1333 I like rapping.
###1335 Really, at the time, I was like, man, all I'm going to do
###1336 is I'm going to make this rhyme.
###1338 And I'm just going to walk.
###1340 I'm going to step right out of this whole thing and just
###1341 start doing hip hop.
###1345 And then, I don't know, man.
###1347 I love the mountains.
###1348 The city just fucks me up.
###1351 And that's where it seems like all that glamour boy shit goes
###1354 on, or even the production stuff.
###1357 If I have to actually drive around down there and try to
###1360 figure this shit out, I'll literally just turn around and
###1364 leave town.
###1366 I just freak out.
###1367 I freak out in Reno.
###1370 [HEAVY RAP MUSIC]
###1378 SHAWN FARMER: Jime Hale--
###1380 he's a buddy mine.
###1381 I met that guy in '85 or '86 or '87 when I
###1384 was still in Colorado.
###1385 He was always this crazy heavy metal dude.
###1388 The band we were in was called Soak.
###1390 But he just kind of brought me in.
###1392 He was like, we want to put rap with metal, which was
###1394 really a novel idea at the time.
###1396 I still don't think anyone is doing it right.
###1398 I mean, there's a couple guys.
###1400 There's Rage Against The Machine and Anthrax.
###1401 We were doing it right at the same time or maybe even before
###1404 some of those guys.
###1404 And he's just like, yeah, you can be the rapper.
###1409 And I'm like, OK, but we were always butting heads.
###1412 It's so hard to have two singers.
###1414 Played in that band for quite a few years off and on.
###1416 It's just so sort to balance.
###1418 You're trying to be a pro snowboarder and go whatever,
###1420 around the world, and then come back to this band.
###1425 Everybody's pissed at you because you were gone for
###1427 three weeks.
###1429 But it was still fun, man.
###1430 We rocked.
###1431 [HEAVY RAP MUSIC]
###1449 SHAWN FARMER: And that whole game is so crazy, but I still
###1452 am into it.
###1453 I still like rapping and stuff.
###1454 And I love snowboarding.
###1456 I still love snowboarding.
###1457 I don't care whether anyone's around or not.
###1460 I just dig it.
###1461 The thing that trips me out, man, is like if things
###1464 would've fell together differently, we'd probably be
###1468 sitting in my mansion by the pool or something.
###1471 But it didn't.
###1473 And I don't know--
###1475 sometimes I feel like you're just chasing that thing.
###1478 And for some people, it all happens, and when it is
###1481 happening, you better get it, and hang onto it as
###1485 tight as you can.
###1486 I steered.
###1488 I took a couple wrong turns, I think.
###1490 I'd rather fucking pound nails than deal with some of these
###1494 kooks that had nothing to do.
###1497 I could go crazy on this.
###1499 But I just saw a lot of this stuff coming.
###1501 And I was just like, man, you just want to be with people
###1509 that you trust or that you believe in.
###1510 And I just think a lot of these people are just like,
###1513 yo, what's the next big thing.
###1515 It's like, yo, fucking the slinky, man.
###1519 I don't fucking know.
###1521 
###1524 JERRY DUGAN: I think that he scared a lot of people,
###1528 because he was a little bit of a loose cannon.
###1531 He did kind of do his own thing.
###1535 And if you're trying to promote an image, and you're
###1538 trying to promote a wholesome image, or you're trying to
###1541 promote a healthy image, and all of a sudden, you've got
###1544 Farmer drunk, taking his clothes off, jumping off
###1548 something, or getting in a fight or yelling at someone.
###1551 Then that's a tough thing when you're a company that has to
###1555 justify results to a board--
###1557 people that don't understand the nature of the sport.
###1561 And I think that's where he got into some problems.
###1564 That said, he had a good run at it.
###1566 He did get paid.
###1567 He got paid well for a while.
###1569 So for sure, someone believed in him at some point.
###1573 But he had different ideas on things too.
###1576 He didn't want to make the board that was the all around
###1579 everything board.
###1580 He wanted to make a big board that he could fly 100-foot
###1582 cliffs off of.
###1583 And there's a small amount of the market
###1585 that rides that way.
###1588 SHAWN FARMER: I don't know what the reason was, but man,
###1589 boards were always breaking.
###1590 Those things broke too, but they just seemed have more
###1594 life than a lot of stuff that was out there.
###1597 I just always thought-- and I still like big boards.
###1600 They're great for certain things.
###1603 It's kind of a lot of work, is all, to ride one.
###1608 JERRY DUGAN: The Farmer--
###1609 the 185-centimeter Farmer board made by Summit was not a
###1612 board that everyone was riding.
###1615 That thing was great if you wanted to drop an 80-fot
###1617 cliff, and you had nice fresh powder on the way in and
###1619 powder on the way out, and you had enough balls and muscle to
###1623 turn the thing.
###1624 But in his sort of theory, it's like, no, no,
###1627 that's what I want.
###1629 He had a pretty good run with K2 for a while.
###1631 K2 had a bunch of boards under his name that encompassed a
###1635 broader riding style.
###1638 SHAWN FARMER: I had a pretty good run at it.
###1641 I look back, and I'm just like, I could've don this,
###1643 this, and this different, and maybe even
###1645 still be up in there.
###1647 But it's like, what are you going to do, man?
###1651 You're fricking snowboarding.
###1652 What do you want?
###1653 
###1658 HANNA TETER: I remember getting asked to do that
###1661 "First Descent" movie with Shawn Farmer and Terje and
###1665 Nick Perata.
###1666 I'd never met Nick or Shawn Farmer.
###1669 It was New Year's before we started filming that movie,
###1672 and I met him at a bar.
###1674 And I just thought he was a sketchy dude.
###1676 And I was like, I have to go on a trip with this crazy guy
###1679 for three weeks.
###1680 And I was all scared, but then when I actually got out to the
###1683 backcountry with them, and they were just super chill,
###1685 and made it, like, the best experience of my life.
###1688 I mean, Shawn is a crazy, crazy man.
###1691 And he can rap like no other.
###1694 But he's a hell of a snowboarder.
###1697 SHAUN WHITE: I was impressed.
###1698 I mean, I know he felt a little overwhelmed when we
###1701 built this massive jump out there in the mountains,
###1703 because it's not really his style.
###1705 But whatever myself and Travis were doing on the jump, he was
###1713 beating that tenfold on just getting down these crazy runs
###1716 on the mountain there.
###1717 I was impressed.
###1719 I was just blown away because he looked at it so differently
###1722 from the way I would look at it.
###1723 I'm like, oh, I want to jump off that.
###1724 He's like, no, I'm going to creep down this ridge, then
###1727 I'm going to cut over.
###1727 And it was impressive to see how he looks at it, because
###1733 everybody sees something but it's always different from
###1736 what everybody else sees.
###1738 SHAWN FARMER: I like big mountain stuff, man.
###1740 I really like slashes.
###1741 I like doing airs.
###1743 And I'm not super focused on tricks.
###1748 If I do a big grab or a big method or a big back or
###1750 something, and just a really sweet line, I like to try to
###1754 be relatively fluid.
###1755 And I like to haul ass.
###1757 I like speed a lot, like really carrying a lot of
###1760 speed, and just getting, like, to that point, where
###1763 I'm like, oh my god.
###1764 I can't even turn anymore.
###1767 I'm just not obsessed with tricks or anything so much as
###1772 I just like being out on the mountain, man.
###1774 I like snowboarding.
###1776 I don't have to try to do a lot of craziness.
###1780 I just take whatever's in front of me, do a couple
###1782 things, get out there, and keep going.
###1785 
###1787 MIKE HATCHETT: Shawn's one of those guys I wish there was
###1789 more people like him today in
###1790 snowboarding, more like Farmer.
###1792 Not to say there's not great personalities out there.
###1795 But Farmer's just one of those guys that you just, you meet
###1799 him and he sticks in your head forever.
###1801 And he's the kind of guy that his personality and his
###1805 charisma, just everything about the guy,
###1809 you just know him.
###1809 And like I said, I wish there was more people like that in
###1812 snowboarding today.
###1813 It's almost like the marketability of someone like
###1814 that, just someone with that amazing of a--
###1819 he's an amazing person.
###1820 And there's not a lot of guys like that around.
###1823 He's amazing.
###1825 
###1828 SHAWN FARMER: All right.
###1831 Ready?
###1832 
###1845 Like that.
###1848 -What's this shirt?
###1850 SHAWN FARMER: Jefferson City Correctional Facility.
###1852 That's where I'm from.
###1854 Jefferson City, Missouri.
###1856 
###1858 It gets the job done.
###1859 
###1863 All right.
###1863 That's enough of that.
