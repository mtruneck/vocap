1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,84



2
0:0:1,84 --> 0:0:3,71
JONATHAN BENNO: I'm not
accustomed to--


3
0:0:3,71 --> 0:0:8,68
I've always done these kinds
of interviews or cooking


4
0:0:8,68 --> 0:0:11,32
segments, they're always
very brief.


5
0:0:11,32 --> 0:0:12,86
Like when we made the pasta.


6
0:0:12,86 --> 0:0:15,1
It's demo a couple of dishes
and it's over.


7
0:0:15,1 --> 0:0:17,54
Tell me about your career
and it's over.


8
0:0:17,54 --> 0:0:20,84
But last night was a little
challenging for me at points.


9
0:0:20,84 --> 0:0:27,15
Because we were together
for four or five hours.


10
0:0:27,15 --> 0:0:32,4
And four or five hours together
with the camera and


11
0:0:32,4 --> 0:0:35,2
you and questions.


12
0:0:35,2 --> 0:0:37,4
You need to keep things going.


13
0:0:37,4 --> 0:0:38,74
And you need to keep
asking questions.


14
0:0:38,74 --> 0:0:43,6
And you just keep shooting--
what did you say, 12 minutes--


15
0:0:43,6 --> 0:0:47,44
that is fun and hit
all the bases.


16
0:0:47,44 --> 0:0:50,81
Honestly, for me, I
wasn't embarrassed


17
0:0:50,81 --> 0:0:53,13
to be with the entourage.


18
0:0:53,13 --> 0:0:57,57
But I felt to stay--


19
0:0:57,57 --> 0:0:58,82
it was a little bit
challenging.


20
0:0:58,82 --> 0:1:2,56



21
0:1:2,56 --> 0:1:3,81
Mm!


22
0:1:3,81 --> 0:1:25,46



23
0:1:25,46 --> 0:1:29,94
It's a casonsei that has a sweet
potato as the filling,


24
0:1:29,94 --> 0:1:33,23
toasted almonds, just a little
bit of sherry vinegar.


25
0:1:33,23 --> 0:1:35,68
And then this one we finish
with mozzarella


26
0:1:35,68 --> 0:1:37,3
that we smoke in-house.


27
0:1:37,3 --> 0:1:40,5



28
0:1:40,5 --> 0:1:42,54
My name is Jonathan Benno and
I'm the chef at Lincoln


29
0:1:42,54 --> 0:1:45,6
Ristorante.


30
0:1:45,6 --> 0:1:49,85
Lincoln Ristorante is on 65th
street, between Amsterdam and


31
0:1:49,85 --> 0:1:52,76
Broadway, right in the
Lincoln Center.


32
0:1:52,76 --> 0:1:55,79
With everything that happens
up here, there are all the


33
0:1:55,79 --> 0:1:58,27
performing arts houses,
it's a pretty


34
0:1:58,27 --> 0:2:0,86
inspirational place to work.


35
0:2:0,86 --> 0:2:4,55
There's been a lot of allusions
to being on stage


36
0:2:4,55 --> 0:2:7,5
when you're working on
the line at Lincoln.


37
0:2:7,5 --> 0:2:8,83
The kitchen is completely
open.


38
0:2:8,83 --> 0:2:11,41



39
0:2:11,41 --> 0:2:17,55
The food is a modern
interpretation of a classic


40
0:2:17,55 --> 0:2:20,22
Italian cuisine.


41
0:2:20,22 --> 0:2:22,685
It doesn't have a
regional focus.


42
0:2:22,685 --> 0:2:25,26
The pasta dishes here are
very, very popular.


43
0:2:25,26 --> 0:2:28,568



44
0:2:28,568 --> 0:2:29,564
Where's the strozz?


45
0:2:29,564 --> 0:2:31,556
-Strozz is behind here.


46
0:2:31,556 --> 0:2:39,4



47
0:2:39,4 --> 0:2:41,2
JONATHAN BENNO: This
is a strozzapreti.


48
0:2:41,2 --> 0:2:44,99
So it's another pasta that
we make in-house.


49
0:2:44,99 --> 0:2:46,4
It has a little bit of
squid ink in it.


50
0:2:46,4 --> 0:2:47,56
That's what gives
it the color.


51
0:2:47,56 --> 0:2:50,78
This is probably one
of the few--


52
0:2:50,78 --> 0:2:54,51
what we'll call signature pastas
at the restaurant.


53
0:2:54,51 --> 0:2:56,62
Strozzapreti means
priest strangler.


54
0:2:56,62 --> 0:3:0,55
Strozza, preti, priest.


55
0:3:0,55 --> 0:3:2,13
I never worked in Italy.


56
0:3:2,13 --> 0:3:4,72
I've been lucky enough
to travel there.


57
0:3:4,72 --> 0:3:7,97
I'd say, I had a good foundation
in pasta making


58
0:3:7,97 --> 0:3:11,91
over the course of the
past couple years.


59
0:3:11,91 --> 0:3:13,26
I grew up in Connecticut.


60
0:3:13,26 --> 0:3:15,956
I start washing dishes
when I was 15.


61
0:3:15,956 --> 0:3:17,47
I moved out to Hawaii.


62
0:3:17,47 --> 0:3:18,87
I worked out there
for a while.


63
0:3:18,87 --> 0:3:20,45
I came back to New York.


64
0:3:20,45 --> 0:3:22,695
I went to the Culinary
Institute of America.


65
0:3:22,695 --> 0:3:24,58
I went back out West.


66
0:3:24,58 --> 0:3:27,4
I was lucky enough to work in
Napa with Thomas Keller the


67
0:3:27,4 --> 0:3:29,49
first year the French
Laundry was open.


68
0:3:29,49 --> 0:3:33,92
I came to New York for about
eight years, and worked for


69
0:3:33,92 --> 0:3:35,49
Daniel Boulud.


70
0:3:35,49 --> 0:3:39,685
I was working at Craft with
Marco Canora and Tom Colicchio


71
0:3:39,685 --> 0:3:44,51
when the opportunity came
up to open Per Se.


72
0:3:44,51 --> 0:3:46,97
I was at Per Se for six years.


73
0:3:46,97 --> 0:3:49,8
I started thinking about
what was next.


74
0:3:49,8 --> 0:3:50,76
I knew that I wanted to do


75
0:3:50,76 --> 0:3:54,47
something completely different.


76
0:3:54,47 --> 0:3:57,26
I've always been passionate
about Italian food.


77
0:3:57,26 --> 0:4:1,25
And I've always loved going to
Italy, and learning about the


78
0:4:1,25 --> 0:4:3,38
culture and the cuisine.


79
0:4:3,38 --> 0:4:7,11
I've tried to take everything
that I've learned up until


80
0:4:7,11 --> 0:4:9,29
this point, and and
apply it here.


81
0:4:9,29 --> 0:4:13,88



82
0:4:13,88 --> 0:4:18,5
Here we are now, two years
later, with a restaurant that


83
0:4:18,5 --> 0:4:22,83
has a firm identity and
a strong following.


84
0:4:22,83 --> 0:4:28,37
The restaurant knows who it is
and what it is and what it


85
0:4:28,37 --> 0:4:31,9
wants to be for, what you
can imagine, is a


86
0:4:31,9 --> 0:4:32,66
very diverse clientele.


87
0:4:32,66 --> 0:4:39,52



88
0:4:39,52 --> 0:4:42,32
You told me to pick a restaurant
that I really


89
0:4:42,32 --> 0:4:43,74
wanted to go eat at.


90
0:4:43,74 --> 0:4:47,14
I've been dying to go to Nick
Kim's restaurant, Neta, in the


91
0:4:47,14 --> 0:4:48,39
West Village.


92
0:4:48,39 --> 0:4:54,29



93
0:4:54,29 --> 0:4:57,95
I know Nick probably for eight
years now, since he opened


94
0:4:57,95 --> 0:5:0,962
Masa and we opened Per Se.


95
0:5:0,962 --> 0:5:3,91
The two guys that joined
me for dinner--


96
0:5:3,91 --> 0:5:7,25
Chung Chow and Dominick
Tesoriero.


97
0:5:7,25 --> 0:5:10,71
Chung, I met out in California,
when he was a cook


98
0:5:10,71 --> 0:5:13,9
at Bouchon and I went back out
to work at the French Laundry,


99
0:5:13,9 --> 0:5:17,19
and then was one of the opening
sous chefs here.


100
0:5:17,19 --> 0:5:19,23
Dominick is a real character.


101
0:5:19,23 --> 0:5:22,2
DOMINICK TESORIERO: I'm
still a [INAUDIBLE].


102
0:5:22,2 --> 0:5:23,84
JONATHAN BENNO: He was probably
with us for about six


103
0:5:23,84 --> 0:5:27,64
months, and comes back often,
and helps us with off-site


104
0:5:27,64 --> 0:5:29,22
events, and things.


105
0:5:29,22 --> 0:5:30,39
Chung is from Hawaii.


106
0:5:30,39 --> 0:5:34,7
And I think we share certainly
a passion for fish and sushi.


107
0:5:34,7 --> 0:5:41,76



108
0:5:41,76 --> 0:5:45,36
NICK KIM: Neta, for us, means
fresh ingredients, what's


109
0:5:45,36 --> 0:5:48,59
available now versus when
it's not in season.


110
0:5:48,59 --> 0:5:50,76
So we're very seasonal driven.


111
0:5:50,76 --> 0:5:53,736
Simple, honest.


112
0:5:53,736 --> 0:5:56,79
And right now what Jimmy is
doing is breaking down the


113
0:5:56,79 --> 0:5:57,54
collar piece.


114
0:5:57,54 --> 0:6:0,8
A lot of the restaurants will
basically just cut right


115
0:6:0,8 --> 0:6:1,78
through it.


116
0:6:1,78 --> 0:6:4,41
But we take the time to
remove each layer.


117
0:6:4,41 --> 0:6:6,93
And what we do with the sinew
is we'll marinate it.


118
0:6:6,93 --> 0:6:7,79
And then we'll grill it.


119
0:6:7,79 --> 0:6:9,62
And we'll make sinew sushi.


120
0:6:9,62 --> 0:6:14,87



121
0:6:14,87 --> 0:6:20,38
-Here we have beautiful, fresh
dungeness crab salad with some


122
0:6:20,38 --> 0:6:23,24
cucumber, wild parsley, and
a dashi vinaigrette.


123
0:6:23,24 --> 0:6:27,4



124
0:6:27,4 --> 0:6:29,6
JONATHAN BENNO: One of the
really beautiful things about


125
0:6:29,6 --> 0:6:32,9
eating like that is it always
leaves you wanting more.


126
0:6:32,9 --> 0:6:35,29
That two to three bites,
and you wish there


127
0:6:35,29 --> 0:6:36,305
was a fourth bite.


128
0:6:36,305 --> 0:6:39,38
But by the time you realize that
there's no fourth bite,


129
0:6:39,38 --> 0:6:41,884
the next course is already
coming to the table.


130
0:6:41,884 --> 0:6:50,34



131
0:6:50,34 --> 0:6:52,66
It's almost the kind of meal,
and the kind of experience,


132
0:6:52,66 --> 0:6:54,44
where you really want
to be quiet.


133
0:6:54,44 --> 0:6:58,27
And you really want to think
about what you're eating.


134
0:6:58,27 --> 0:7:2,61
And I think you pick up on
that pretty quickly.


135
0:7:2,61 --> 0:7:8,16



136
0:7:8,16 --> 0:7:10,305
NICK KIM: We cook things very
lightly, so when you taste


137
0:7:10,305 --> 0:7:13,46
things it's very gentle.


138
0:7:13,46 --> 0:7:16,61
Like this scallop dish,
for example.


139
0:7:16,61 --> 0:7:19,52
Scallop's warm, foie
gras is hot.


140
0:7:19,52 --> 0:7:23,27
And the uni is room
temperature-ish.


141
0:7:23,27 --> 0:7:28,155
Our soy sauce that we age
in a bourbon cask.


142
0:7:28,155 --> 0:7:32,12
JONATHAN BENNO: If you had said
to me warm foie gras, sea


143
0:7:32,12 --> 0:7:36,42
urchin, scallop, I wouldn't
connect those dots myself.


144
0:7:36,42 --> 0:7:39,66
But the way that he did it--


145
0:7:39,66 --> 0:7:42,31
definitely one of the best
things that I'd ever had.


146
0:7:42,31 --> 0:7:47,76



147
0:7:47,76 --> 0:7:49,505
Although I was full--


148
0:7:49,505 --> 0:7:52,11
not like overstuffed
but perfect at


149
0:7:52,11 --> 0:7:53,81
the end of the meal--


150
0:7:53,81 --> 0:7:57,401
it was one of those meals that
I didn't want it to end.


151
0:7:57,401 --> 0:8:1,46



152
0:8:1,46 --> 0:8:3,9
I remember the first time I
ate at the French Laundry,


153
0:8:3,9 --> 0:8:5,39
feeling the same way.


154
0:8:5,39 --> 0:8:7,27
Thank you very much.


155
0:8:7,27 --> 0:8:10,53
What Nick and his team are doing
there, they really stand


156
0:8:10,53 --> 0:8:15,0
out in my mind as one of the
best meals that I've ever had.


157
0:8:15,0 --> 0:8:21,11



158
0:8:21,11 --> 0:8:23,59
After that we went to
probably one of my


159
0:8:23,59 --> 0:8:25,38
favorite bars in the city--


160
0:8:25,38 --> 0:8:26,63
Peter McManus Cafe.


161
0:8:26,63 --> 0:8:34,49



162
0:8:34,49 --> 0:8:36,7
My wife is a chef as well.


163
0:8:36,7 --> 0:8:38,12
That was always kind of
our rendezvous point.


164
0:8:38,12 --> 0:8:41,24
We would meet there, and
have a beer together.


165
0:8:41,24 --> 0:8:42,82
INTERVIEWER: Would you say it's
a hard thing to bring a


166
0:8:42,82 --> 0:8:44,6
camera to your favorite bar?


167
0:8:44,6 --> 0:8:46,53
JONATHAN BENNO: That was kind
of a funny location.


168
0:8:46,53 --> 0:8:49,17
People want to see what's going
on, and who is that.


169
0:8:49,17 --> 0:8:51,142
Why is there a camera?


170
0:8:51,142 --> 0:8:53,329
I've lived in that neighborhood
for a long time,


171
0:8:53,329 --> 0:8:55,516
and I know those guys
very, very well.


172
0:8:55,516 --> 0:8:59,9



173
0:8:59,9 --> 0:9:5,1
For me to be out at McManus at
midnight was surreal, almost.


174
0:9:5,1 --> 0:9:7,74
My wife and I moved up to
Westchester recently.


175
0:9:7,74 --> 0:9:8,76
We have two little girls.


176
0:9:8,76 --> 0:9:12,41
I started bobbing a little bit
towards the end, because for


177
0:9:12,41 --> 0:9:13,946
me to be out--


178
0:9:13,946 --> 0:9:14,938
it's just funny.


179
0:9:14,938 --> 0:9:16,922
I guess I'm getting older.


180
0:9:16,922 --> 0:9:27,86



181
0:9:27,86 --> 0:9:32,84
The dish I chose to make
for the real munchie--


182
0:9:32,84 --> 0:9:35,2
I love sandwiches.


183
0:9:35,2 --> 0:9:38,75
I'm crazy about sandwiches.


184
0:9:38,75 --> 0:9:40,57
I always have been.


185
0:9:40,57 --> 0:9:42,49
I also love to work
with tripe.


186
0:9:42,49 --> 0:9:45,53
So what we did was we took the
honeycomb tripe and braised it


187
0:9:45,53 --> 0:9:47,96
whole, until it was tender.


188
0:9:47,96 --> 0:9:53,205
And then cut it into cutlet-size
pieces, breaded


189
0:9:53,205 --> 0:9:54,884
it, and fried it.


190
0:9:54,884 --> 0:9:57,61



191
0:9:57,61 --> 0:10:4,6
So it was a tripe cutlet on our
country bread with lemon


192
0:10:4,6 --> 0:10:8,76
aoli, B&G hot peppers, pickled
red onions, and arugula.


193
0:10:8,76 --> 0:10:13,46



194
0:10:13,46 --> 0:10:14,7
DOMINICK TESORIERO: Amazing.


195
0:10:14,7 --> 0:10:19,73
Sometimes, life is
really grand--


196
0:10:19,73 --> 0:10:21,822
just sometimes.


197
0:10:21,822 --> 0:10:24,74
JONATHAN BENNO: Cheers.


198
0:10:24,74 --> 0:10:25,977
DOMINICK TESORIERO: Chung.


199
0:10:25,977 --> 0:10:28,9
CHUNG CHOW: Cheers it up.


200
0:10:28,9 --> 0:10:31,42
JONATHAN BENNO: You
drove, right?


201
0:10:31,42 --> 0:10:33,22
DOMINICK TESORIERO: I did.


202
0:10:33,22 --> 0:10:34,47
CHUNG CHOW: This is so good.


203
0:10:34,47 --> 0:12:34,47
