###48 - Whoa. - What a wild kickflip wallplant!
###51 It takes me back to my boarding days.
###54 Funny. Cos I feel like the only boarding you did
###57 was with Charlie and Henry and the horrid biscuit game.
###60 Oh, OK, yeah, fair point.
###63 The competition has been amazing. The girls have been great.
###66 But the one everyone is talking about, Kim Matthews, is still missing.
###69 We've actually got some footage of her as an early skateboarding prodigy.
###74 Kim started competing when she was seven.
###76 She won the National Mixed Under-16s
###78 when she was just 11 years old.
###80 I mean, attractive girl even then.
###82 - Really? Because I said 11. - Yeah, objectively.
###85 Two years ago, aged 17,
###87 she won the London Trials.
###88 Mum and Dad supported her
###92 with parental pride
###93 and simplistic homemade signs.
###95 Then nothing. We haven't seen her since.
###98 There was an accident, Rick.
###100 The car crash, when she lost her mum.
###103 We're thinking of you, Kim. Wherever you are,
###107 whatever you're doing, we hope you're riding high and living the dream.
###111 And todayk special: two for one on onion rings.
###114 Onion rings, two for one.
###116 Please don't push.
###126 I thought it was junk mail. -Big red letters.
###129 "Notjunk mail." It says "Urgent Demand" on it.
###131 - They always say that. it's hardly... - it's nearly a grand.
###138 Dad, you can'tjust ignore it.
###141 But, hey, we're big hitters, right? We'll just sell the Bentley.
###145 Oh, no, someone's stolen the Bentley. Plan B?
###149 They're bluffing. I'll think of something.
###154 How are you getting on?
###157 No. Nothing yet.
###161 - I'll talk to Les. Sort something out. - What would I do without you?
###165 Fester.
###168 Hmm!
###170 My rota is... full.
###176 Maybe if you're extra nice to me? Hmm?
###180 Oh, Les, don't be a cock all your life.
###183 That's your extra nice?
###186 How did my summerjob become the rest-of-my life job?
###189 A friend of my cousin's just got into this well-good scam.
###193 Catering agencies. Serving champagne and tiny food to toffs. £12.50 an hour.
###200 Hmm. Toffs and champagne or Les and... Urgh.
###205 I can get the number if you want. You gotta be posh, though.
###209 Posh? Trace, I can do posh.
###214 - Hi, I'm Arabella. - I'm Henrietta.
###217 - Isabella. - Petronella.
###222 Kim.
###223 White wine? Yes.
###226 Red wine?
###228 Yes.
###230 Dessert wine?
###233 No.
###234 I ls it true what they say about posh girls?
###239 I ls it true what they say about posh girls?
###245 shit.
###249 You're a lovely girl, but I'm just not sure.
###252 Let me try. You're just not sure
###255 I'm the right kind of girl for your clients.
###257 It's hard to say why exactly,
###260 but it's probably to do with the fact that I'm not called Arabella
###263 or Isabella or anything-bella.
###265 I don't have hundred-quid highlights, perfect nails
###268 or, I'm just guessing here, expensively trimmed pubes.
###272 So even though I'm the only person
###274 with actual experience of actual work in the actual real world,
###277 and you know I'd try really, really hard,
###282 I'm just not the right kind of girl.
###287 - Is that about the size of it? - About there, yes.
###296 This is Bella.
###298 She did what?
###301 Oh, for God's sake, the silly cow.
###304 Yes, it's the day after tomorrow. Everyone's booked out.
###310 Wait there,
###312 er,... Kim.
###316 - It sounds great. - I said no.
###318 - What was the job? - Cooking and cleaning.
###321 Same as I do at work. Same as I do here.
###323 - Was the pay rubbish? - No, it's better. Double, plus tips.
###326 But... But still...
###329 But still what?
###332 It's in a ski chalet. In Austria.
###337 For four months.
###338 - Right. Well, I'm sure I could... - You couldn't.
###342 I'd come home and find a skeleton on the couch holding the remote.
###348 That's a bit harsh.
###349 - Totally the right decision. - You think so?
###352 Yeah. What's a luxury chalet with hot, rich clients in a beautiful ski resort
###357 got on this place? it's a no-brainer.
###360 - Oi, I found this toenail in my... - Don't even try.
###364 See? Would you get that kind of quality entertainment in Austria?
###368 I don't think so.
###378 Hi, it's Kim Matthews from yesterday. I was wondering if you're still...
###382 Still desperately seeking a chalet girl? Yes, I am.
###385 - You are? - Could you do it?
###387 You have to be there tomorrow. It's ten hours on the overnight train.
###393 Right. I'm making freezer food to last until April.
###396 You know how the microwave works?
###398 It's a magnetron that converts electricity...
###401 - No, no, no. Like on, off? -Yeah, yeah.
###405 What am I doing? I'm packing you off to some mountainous wasteland,
###408 while I'm stuck here looking for a job.
###411 it'll happen, as long as you keep trying.
###414 - But you're only 19. -Exactly! I'm 19.
###416 Lt% Austria. Hardly a wasteland.
###419 Austria. Famous for "The Sound of Music", breaded food
###422 and the invention of psychoanalysis. You join the dots.
###424 You Te such a freak. No wonder nobody will hire you.
###429 - And you won't forget to have a bath? - Every month.
###433 I give up.
###465 And what exactly am I supposed to do with this?
###467 - What is it? - You can't live on beans on toast.
###470 We won two world wars and one World Cup on beans on toast,
###473 so don't knock 'em.
###474 I've set it up online, so you'll get a delivery every week.
###477 Lexi, this is my health-freak dad, Bill. Bill, this is Lexi.
###481 I'm trusting you to keep him alive till I get back, OK?
###483 - Shit.
###486 My pay goes into the mortgage account.
###488 I'll send any tips back. Any envelopes...
###490 Big red letters. I know. Now hurry up, you'll miss your train.
###495 - Maybe this isn't a great idea. - Go, now.
###504 - I love you, Kimberley. -I love you, William.
###510 Bye, Dad.
###516 - See you later. Auf Wiedersehen.
###532 Oh, my God, I'm never doing that again! I can't remember the whole night.
###536 Honestly.
###538 Oh, my God, did you see that guy staring at my tits the whole night?
###542 It was so awkward.
###543 He was such a perv. And he had a hairy chest and everything. Can you imagine?
###548 Yeah.
###551 Can I call you back, babes?
###558 - Seriously? - Yep.
###562 OK, let's go. Put your bags in the back and get in.
###575 Shit.
###582 Oh, my God, they're huge.
###585 Yeah, they're mountains. Huge is part of the concept.
###590 You don't even ski, do you? What are you doing here?
###593 - it's a job. I need to earn money. - Earn? What, as in, like, "save"?
###613 - Oh. - Thought I recognised that arse.
###615 - Alright, ugly. You coming out? - Yeah. Just dumping the new girl off.
###619 - The new girl! Let me see. - Kim, Jules. Jules, Kim.
###623 - Hi. - Hi.
###629 - I'll see you later, babes. - See you later, babes.
###651 it's a bit poky, isn't it?
###653 So is this guy head of some evil criminal empire?
###656 - He's a banker. - That's a yes, then.
###658 - You don't get it, do you? - Get what?
###660 This is the best job in the Alps.
###663 They use the place to entertain clients plus a few family weekends.
###666 Apart from that, they're hardly ever here.
###669 I had 30 girls texting me after Milly broke her leg, begging me for the job.
###674 But the agency said it had to be someone they'd seen.
###677 You know what's really funny is, I wasn't going to take it at first.
###680 OK, maybe not really funny but...
###683 Do what I tell you and if you're not up to it, I will tell them.
###687 Listen, a week ago I was mopping up puke in a burger bar.
###690 No, you listen, little Miss Essex no-coat, non-skiing freak show.
###696 I'm not actually from...
###697 The Madsens fly in at five. They expect perfection from the start.
###701 Now, if you screw up or, more importantly, if you make me look bad,
###706 then clearing up puke will be a fond memory of the good old days. Got it?
###711 Oh!
###714 Got it.
###717 So I'll just make myself at home, then.
###738 J' Farmer in my own farm
###740 I In, out and far
###743 I From the high ceilings
###802 - Look out! - Hey!
###832 it's a total nightmare.
###833 It's not like you've got to spend the next four months
###836 sharing a room with her.
###838 - Oh, no, wait, you have. - I'm serious, babes.
###842 It's like she's never seen snow before. it's like she's from Africa.
###846 A chalet girl who can't ski. That's classic.
###850 - Tell me about it. Later, babes. - Later, babes.
###859 The three golden rules of chalet-girling.
###862 One, no friends up in the chalet.
###864 Two, party all you like, as long as breakfast is on the table at eight.
###868 - You oversleep, you pack your bags. - Friends, breakfast, check.
###872 Three, no sleeping with the clients.
###875 Unless they're fit. Or minted. Or hitting on you.
###879 - Basically, there's only two rules. - Basically, yeah.
###885 We're just going to get the essentials for now.
###888 Right, so shall I go and get the veg?
###890 Six tins of caviar, please. Beluga.
###893 Caviar, right. Of course.
###896 I'm more front-of-house type, you're more back office.
###900 Because I know how to talk to them.
###902 Yeah, I don't speak much posh. Dropped it after GCSEs.
###906 - Do you want to prep the veg? -I live to prep veg.
###909 Right, carrots, we've got a big game coming up.
###911 I want to see each and every one of you giving 110 per cent.
###915 Are you done?
###917 Yeah. I thought you said they landed at five.
###919 I did. But the pilot called. They ran into some headwind.
###922 Oh, right... The who called?
###927 -God, he's here already. -Who?
###930 The owners' all-round ski guide, fixer and gimp.
###936 Kim, meet the very handsome, very powerful Bernhardt.
###940 - You're late. - Did I mention very charming too?
###945 - Is this the new Hausmédchen? - Hi.
###950 Hey, welcome!
###955 - So, who is everyone? - Oh, you'll figure it out.
###960 You know, you're going to have to stop being so helpful all the time.
###970 Rule three. Anyway, he's taken.
###973 - Turned you down, did he? - No.
###977 So, what's the deal? How do I, you know, talk to them?
###982 You don't talk to them. You don't look them directly in the eye.
###988 - And curtsey when you meet them. - Oh.
###991 - Alright, needle cock? - You old slapper.
###994 - You OK down there? - Yeah, yeah, just... stretching.
###998 - Right. Is this the new helper? - Er, something like that.
###1002 Hi, rm Kim.
###1004 Jonny. And I don't actually have a needle cock.
###1007 - He did when he was ten. - Hey.
###1011 I'm so excited to be back! Hi!
###1013 - Hey, Chloe. - How are you?
###1015 - This is Milly's replacement, Kate. - Kim.
###1018 This heartbreaker is her brother Nigel.
###1021 - Nigel. The famous Nigel. - He really does have a tiny cock.
###1025 Hey, it's not what you got, it's about where you put it in...
###1032 Please ignore him.
###1034 This is my dad Richard, "Call me Dickie."
###1036 Are you following this?
###1038 - Dad, this is Kim. - Call me Dickie.
###1041 Thank you for stepping in. Just do whatever Georgie does.
###1044 Except that thing with her chin.
###1046 - We liked that, didn't we? - That was a one-off.
###1049 - Speaking of one-offs... - Hey!
###1051 Hello.
###1053 This is my wife Caroline.
###1058 Who apparently has a throat infection.
###1061 - Help us with the bags? - Ah, yes.
###1065 - Ahem. - Give her a chance.
###1067 I didn't say anything.
###1077 And lovingly topped off with gravy, é Ia me.
###1084 Back office.
###1087 Wouldn't want to steal your thunder with the sprouts.
###1092 Oh, brilliant. Look at that!
###1106 Ibble dibble number one, with 12 ibble dibbles calls ibble dibble number...
###1117 There. Right there.
###1120 Mmm! I want to be a profiterole.
###1125 So these guys fly in on a private jet
###1127 and their idea of fun is rubbing a burnt cork on each ether's faces?
###1131 That's insane.
###1133 Sanity's overrated. Tried it once, didn't get it.
###1139 Join in. We don't bite.
###1141 Well, my mum bites a bit. The rest of us just nibble ibble dibble...
###1145 Talking crap.
###1146 - You! it's time. - No, there's absolutely no way.
###1149 - Yes! Yes! -I don't want to!
###1153 Georgie! Georgie! Georgie! Georgie!
###1156 OK, OK.
###1159 Hark! The Herald.
###1163 Ooh.
###1177 - Go, go, go. - Oh, Nigel.
###1179 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
###1184 See now, this is my idea of fun. You should join in.
###1188 J' Hark! The herald angels sing
###1191 Unfortunately I'm only grade one at... whatever that is.
###1197 Yeah!
###1199 - You eating alright? - Five a day. How's it going?
###1202 - It's fine. - What are the people like?
###1205 - They're...
###1207 Who wants more champagne?
###1209 ..fine.
###1211 If it doesn't work out, I can always nick one of their paintings.
###1214 - What's that noise?
###1217 Oh, nothing, er...
###1219 No, it's next door. There's a truck reversing,
###1223 I think.
###1227 Listen, Kimmy,
###1229 I really miss you, you know?
###1231 I know, Dad. Me too.
###1241 Georgie? Georgie?
###1245 It's seven.
###1251 Rule two?
###1259 - Is this caviar? - Sure looks like it.
###1262 Well, dig in, everyone, and enjoy your $300 omelettes.
###1269 Jesus, Kim. You have to wake me. I don't need you making me look bad.
###1274 - No kidding.
###1277 So what am I supposed to do all day, then?
###1280 I don't know. I'm sure you'll find something. Look around.
###1314 Oh, shit.
###1317 Wait! Stop!
###1337 - Georgie, this cake is supreme. - Thank you, Jonny.
###1339 Hm-hmm! Sure is.
###1341 - This place is so magical. - It is when you're here.
###1344 Enjoy it. You won't ski this much when you're starting a family.
###1348 - Do I get a say in any of this? - No, snoogles, you don't.
###1351 I'm not sure I'm ready for any of this. Do I look like a grandfather?
###1355 - Don't answer that!
###1359 Thank you. Ooh.
###1364 That's hot!
###1382 I Angels watching over me with smiles upon their face
###1387 J' Cos I have made it through this far in an unforgiving place
###1392 J' it feels sometimes this hill's too steep for a girl like me to climb
###1398 I But I must knock those thoughts right down
###1401 I I'll do it in my own time
###1403 J* I don't care
###1405 I I?n halfway there
###1408 J* On a road that leads me straight to who knows where
###1418 You crazy freak! Watch where you're going!
###1420 I'm so sorry. Sorry.
###1422 Stay safe, Betty Boop. Hang outside on the ripside!
###1425 - Yeah, and in English? - Hang outside on the ripside.
###1432 Ciao!
###1434 .P I tell you what
###1436 I What I have found
###1439 I That I?n no fool
###1442 J* I'm just upside down
###1444 I Ain 't got no cares
###1447 I I ain 't got no rules
###1450 J' I think I like
###1452 I Living upside down
###1458 I You gotta slow it down
###1459 - J' But then you pick it up
###1463 J' Come on and try a little topsy-tun/y back-to-front the right way round
###1469 You blow at boarding. But you sure are styley.
###1472 I'll take it you're not into pink all-in-ones?
###1480 - Mikki. Single guy from Finland. - Kim. Not interested from England.
###1487 - You know the skateboarding? - A bit.
###1489 Same, same, but different. You want some help?
###1494 - Yeah. - OK, come on, get up.
###1500 OK, in skateboarding, weight back. In snowboarding, weight centred.
###1504 OK. Right.
###1508 - Knees. - OK.
###1513 Turn with your shoulders, not the knees.
###1516 You're a natural.
###1519 It's like skateboarding, huh?
###1521 Whoo-hoo!
###1525 - That was pretty cool. - That was nothing, Betty.
###1528 Let's get high.
###1530 UP-
###1531 Oh. No, I can't. I'm on the budget tour.
###1535 Betty... Follow me.
###1548 Hey, look. That's the biggest snowboarding competition in Tyrol.
###1552 Every year I enter, every year I face-plant.
###1556 But this year I rock it!
###1558 Hey, we'll enter together.
###1561 Why? Because I'm such a pro boarder?
###1563 Three months, maybe.
###1565 Maybe, maybe not.
###1568 Come on. $25,000. it's easy for you. You're a skateboarder.
###1572 I pulled a 360 my first day on a board.
###1575 And broke your neck, right? -No. My leg.
###1580 Just so you know, I've given Jonny your mother's ring.
###1583 That's a coincidence. I've given him one of her dresses. He'll look lovely.
###1587 It is not funny. The marquee is pencilled for June.
###1590 It was quite funny.
###1592 Didn't you get the message? You're joining us. Dress up.
###1597 I... did.
###1598 Don't worry. She made me change too.
###1601 Drainpipe jeans and winkle-pickers aren't very this season apparently.
###1607 You were never a style guru.
###1609 I was.
###1613 Lippy.
###1616 Liner.
###1617 Lashes.
###1619 Accessories.
###1621 I want those back.
###1622 And... hair gum. Use sparingly.
###1626 Hair gum?
###1637 And like that, she became a swan.
###1638 So I used to be an ugly duckling, then?
###1640 Someone needs to learn how to take a compliment.
###1645 - Ah, it all makes sense now. - Yeah. I'm just back office.
###1654 - It's a shoelace. - Er, it's bow tie.
###1657 No, it's a shoelace knot. Come here.
###1666 Didn't think you'd be the kind of girl who knew how to tie a bow tie.
###1669 And here's me thinking you were the kind of boy who would.
###1678 Big night for you, then?
###1688 There.
###1690 Licensed to kill.
###1694 - Or be killed.
###1706 Right, who needs a drink?
###1711 - Oh, Georgie. What are these? - Mini-burgers. Don't blame me.
###1716 They are sensational.
###1719 - Trying to get me drunk? - Just helping you on your way.
###1721 Greasing your nuts, as it were.
###1723 - Rule three? - Oh, shut up.
###1727 What are you grinning at?
###1730 Nothing. Just think I'm starting to get the hang of this.
###1733 The cake's on the oven. The beef is nearly done. And the mousse has set.
###1737 Oh, thank you.
###1741 Thank you.
###1743 - Wow. Did you hear what... - Yeah, don't get used to it.
###1746 Get a fresh one of these.
###1748 Such responsibility. Do I get a performance star?
###1751 - What? - Doesn't matter.
###1763 Chloe, you look wonderful.
###1772 Oh, look. Looks like the new girl's putting on pre-dinner entertainment.
###1776 Oh, dear, stand back.
###1779 Kim, wait. Kim...
###1784 What a waste. That's vintage.
###1793 Doctor's orders. The good news is, you've already got the headache,
###1797 so you can drink as much as you like.
###1799 - I should go and help Georgie. - I wouldn't worry.
###1801 - I think Nigel has her covered. - Thanks.
###1809 - Hit the spot. - Yeah, it should. '62 Dom.
###1814 - Dom? - It's 500 quid a bottle.
###1817 500? Think I'll just take the cash next time.
###1824 Why am I here? I'm stuck in a parallel reality
###1827 where people drink my monthly salary every ten minutes.
###1829 You're right. We're aliens. My mother has a tail. Did you see it?
###1834 Your mum is the scariest woman I've ever met.
###1837 You want to know how she met my dad? Air stewardess. Concorde.
###1840 Your dad was an air stewardess?
###1844 She's not that scary.
###1849 Well, look, I should be getting back.
###1851 Yeah, of course. Thanks for the Dom.
###1857 Yeah.
###1872 Can we talk about this later?
###1874 She won't wait forever, Jonny.
###1877 I feel so sorry for her.
###1881 See?
###1886 - Thank you. - Everything alright?
###1888 Yeah, everything's fine. We'll be back out in February.
###1892 See if you can figure out the whole champagne-bottle thing by then.
###1895 - Yep, I will practise daily. - Knock yourself out.
###1900 Trying to shake your hand, punch you in the stomach. Not cool.
###1903 So, I'll put the photos on Facebook.
###1907 Well,... poke me.
###1911 Right. OK, girls.
###1913 This is for all your hard work. Thank you so much.
###1917 And, Kim, you know you get a lift pass too, don't you?
###1920 Just charge it to the chalet. Unless you'd prefer the cash.
###1924 - Lift pass would be great. - OK.
###1927 - Alright, let's go. - It's a private plane. It can wait.
###1930 - It will. I won't. - Desperate to get back to work.
###1933 OK, maybe I'll quit, and next time we can hitchhike here.
###1936 A father-son adventure. I like the sound of that. Bye.
###1944 - "Poke me"? - Piss off.
###1947 Slut.
###1950 - 200-euro tip for one week?
###1953 Are you sure you're just cooking?
###1955 I'll put it in the bank when I can. You OK?
###1959 - Yeah. Solid. - Huh?
###1961 I mean sound, yeah.
###1963 - Don't let them work you too hard. - I won't.
###1979 Right, Finland, let's do this. Where do we start?
###1982 Well, in slopestyle, you are scored on your tricks on the rails,
###1987 and the jump you pull at the end.
###1989 - You smell me? - Yes, I smell you. Unfortunately.
###1994 Think about the run. Only the run. Be the board.
###2002 Let's get tricky with Mikki!
###2010 Right, come on, Kim.
###2032 Yes!
###2039 - Hey. - Hey.
###2042 You do realise you're riding a beginner board from, like, the 16th century?
###2046 I thought the 16th century was the golden age of snowboarding.
###2050 Go to the rental shop and pick yourself up a park board.
###2052 You'll have more fun on that, trust me.
###2055 And ask for Willy. Tell him Tara sent you. He'll hook you up.
###2060 Stay safe out there.
###2063 Thanks.
###2076 Kann ich dir helfen?
###2079 Oh, I'm just looking, thanks.
###2081 Rentals are only 80 euros a week, and half-price for staff.
###2086 Well, I'm staff. And actually, Tara told me to come by.
###2091 OK, fine. 30.
###2094 Freestyle board, boots and helmet. You get top end for that.
###2109 Cool. Deal.
###2113 J* For such a long time
###2117 J* We've been standing in line
###2120 .P And it's been so long
###2124 Whoo!
###2133 - Georgie! - Hey!
###2137 Check it out! That's your buddy, Kim.
###2139 Whoo!
###2141 I thought you said she hadn't been in the mountains before.
###2144 She hadn't.
###2146 I Far away with me
###2147 J* You will never know
###2149 Hey, Kimmy. I've got my first interview tomorrow.
###2152 And, well, I'm being a good boy and going through the statements, but I saw
###2157 that tip money hasn't gone in. it's probably their fault
###2160 but I just thought I'd let you know.
###2162 And, hey, Kimmy, aubergines. Whoo! My new favourite food. Who knew?
###2167 Alright, Kimmy, love you.
###2184 - Didn't hear you get up. - I haven't.
###2216 Level nine! Yeah, baby.
###2223 You really think you're going to win that pro?
###2225 N-N-No.
###2227 Hallo!
###2229 Abend. Friulein.
###2232 - Hey, Bernie. - What's with the towel, Bernie?
###2235 My name is Bernhardt. Mr Madsen, he asked me to test the hot tub.
###2240 - Did he now? - Jawohl.
###2243 There is, you must know, room for more than just one.
###2248 That is so funny,
###2250 because Kim and I were just saying
###2253 how much we would love to share a hot tub with Bernhardt.
###2256 - For sure? - Yeah.
###2259 But the problem is, we don't have our swimsuits.
###2263 Who needs swimsuits?
###2266 Yeah, Kim, who needs swimsuits?
###2268 You are so right.
###2270 Maybe when we're out there you could give me a back rub.
###2273 And then we can, like, frolic naked in the snow!
###2277 Yeah.
###2284 Ah! I understand. The famous English humour.
###2289 I forget.
###2300 Stop snowing!
###2301 I You cannot change this
###2304 J* We are not going back
###2309 I Yeah
###2326 Yes!
###2334 it's your birthday?
###2336 What makes you think that?
###2347 You want to look at anything else? Bank statements, knicker drawer?
###2351 - Bertie's. Now. - I'm can't, I'm saving.
###2354 I thought you were just about to win $25,000.
###2357 I don't think you need to save. Come on.
###2360 No, Georgie. I'm not going.
###2362 Betty in the house!
###2365 You owe me ten euros, G. She bet me you'd never come in.
###2368 She says you were too much of a... How you say? Chav? What is a chav?
###2372 Yeah, Georgie, what is a chav?
###2374 I didn't... His English is awful.
###2377 Buy yourself some vegetables.
###2380 Hey, Willy. This is Kim.
###2382 We already met. Tara says you look sweet on the freestyle.
###2385 Do you know who that is?
###2388 - Yeah. It's Tara. - Tara Dakides!
###2390 She won, like, 1,000 X Games medals.
###2393 First chick in the world to pull a backside rodeo, right, Willy?
###2396 Broke her back in three places learning it.
###2399 Now she needs a painkiller every time she rides.
###2401 - Insane. What is she doing here? - The Roxy. Her big comeback.
###2404 She reckons this girl has game.
###2406 I taught her everything she knows!
###2411 - Alright. -Yeah.
###2413 Happy birthday! Blow out your candles!
###2418 Whoo-hoo!
###2436 J' Come away with me, far away with me
###2440 I You will never know until you go
###2446 J' When will you go?
###2452 J' Fly away with me, just leave the gravity
###2455 .P it's all just for show
###2458 J' When will you go?
###2462 I Just let go
###2466 J* For such a long time
###2470 J* We've been standing in line
###2473 I it% been so long
###2477 - it's just a few. Come on. - But it's rule number one.
###2481 The night is young, and so are we.
###2485 Just a few.
###2495 - This is your fault. - You are welcome.
###2498 Oh, come on!
###2502 - Little Finnish lunatic. - How long have you been together?
###2507 - Oh, we're not together. - My balls are ice cream!
###2517 Argh.
###2520 Chillout.
###2523 Chill out, chill out, chill out,
###2526 chill out, chill out, chill out, chill out, chill out, chill out!
###2533 Chill out, chill out, chill out, chill out, chill out, chill out!
###2574 You here all season?
###2576 - Jimmy's going home. - Don't tempt me.
###2578 There's a broken coffee table in the hall, the speaker system is kaput,
###2582 and vomit on the yucca plant.
###2585 Excellent work, girls.
###2588 Just as long as nobody painted a comedy moustache on the...
###2600 OK, look, just clean up the mess, I'll replace the kit,
###2604 you pay me back later. We'll take it out of your tips.
###2606 - But what's happened... - They don't need to know.
###2609 I don't understand why they would do this if they knew we were coming.
###2613 - You told them, right? - Ja, sicher.
###2615 Jawohl. I say Mr Jonny come early because of the good snow.
###2619 - No, no, no, he didn't! - You didn't!
###2621 -I did. - Awesome sauna, bro.
###2627 OK, erm... You do not get to call me needle cock ever again.
###2630 And you, next time you have a birthday party, do it at your own house.
###2634 Yeah, yeah, a few rounds of Twister,
###2637 a couple of games of gin rummy and we're away.
###2639 - Great. - Pop round if you're in the area.
###2641 - Maybe I will. - Cool.
###2647 Er, breakfast at eight. OK?
###2654 Better luck next time, Scheisskopt
###2660 - Kim? - Georgie?
###2662 You're really going to have to win that competition now.
###2669 - Yep.
###2677 Come on, babes.
###2679 First day of the season.
###2685 See you later. Try not to organise any mass raves while we're out.
###2692 I I?n not Mr Muscle but I can be loathsome and I can hustle you
###2700 Look, Dad. I'll speak to you later. I've really got to go. Love you.
###2704 Bye'
###2712 Come on.
###2721 - Hi. - Hi.
###2726 Ill
###2727 Jesus, have you slept with half the bloody resort?
###2730 - Only the useful half. -I can be useful.
###2733 I I?n not Mr Muscle but I can be loathsome and I can hustle you
###2738 J' I'm not Mr Muscle but I can be loathsome
###2740 Is it true chalet girls all have sex in gondolas?
###2743 Oh, yeah. Non-stop. We are crazy for it.
###2746 Come on, can't people see in?
###2747 The windows steam up if you do it right.
###2750 Yep. On this one you only have 90 seconds. No time for foreplay.
###2754 90 seconds is Nige's record.
###2756 - I still think I can do better. - OK, sister present.
###2761 - Check out the fresh tracks. -Wow.
###2764 - The Yeti. - The who?
###2767 Not really a Yeti. Just some local mystery guy.
###2769 He's always first to put fresh tracks down the powder.
###2772 - You know he's a guy because... - Local mystery person.
###2775 He, she, they climb through the night, ski down at dawn. Pretty amazing.
###2779 Amazing I weird.
###2783 I'd love to have sex in a gondola.
###2796 You girls want to come ski with us? Bernhardt told me about this empty run.
###2799 I'm sure they have things they want to do.
###2802 - I'm meeting someone at the snowpark. - Worried you can't keep up, huh?
###2806 - We'll see about that.
###2843 Hey. Over here!
###2863 Come on. Your turn to jump.
###2885 You OK?
###2894 Chloe. Chloe, wait!
###2896 No, Chloe please don't! Chloe.
###2904 - Does it hurt? - Of course it f ricking hurts, idiot!
###2908 OK, give her some more of that strong stuff. Yeah.
###2913 - I feel bad. - So you should. It's all your fault.
###2916 I'm joking. it's really not.
###2917 I'll get her back to London this afternoon. We know a good surgeon.
###2921 I'll back out in a couple of weeks with some clients.
###2924 So I'll see you then, then.
###2927 Then.
###2947 Three! Two! One!
###2955 - I need help. - Me too.
###2959 Taking big jumps, lesson one.
###2961 It's complex, so watch close.
###2975 Jump into my arms, Betty!
###2981 Betty Boop? You there?
###2983 - Betty?
###3002 What's wrong?
###3007 Betty, jumping is easy.
###3011 Landing is the hard bit.
###3013 Come on.
###3023 - You ready? - Yeah.
###3026 On three. Three!
###3049 Yeah!
###3055 J' Chicken! Pay the chicken back back, pay the chicken back
###3059 I Pay back the chicken back, do the chicken payback
###3063 I Piggy! Pay the piggy back back, pay the piggy back
###3066 J' Pay back the piggy back, do the piggy payback
###3069 J' Monkey! Pay the monkey back back, pay the monkey back
###3072 J' See the monkey, do the monkey, pay the monkey back
###3075 Slamdownl Yes!
###3083 - My flying angel! - Ow!
###3087 - Are you really going to go for it? - Yeah. This girl is a podgy.
###3090 - She's a what...? - Podgy. She's a real podgy.
###3094 I'm not podgy!
###3096 Oh, prodigy.
###3098 Hey, Nigel, my sexy beast! How are you?
###3102 Nigel?
###3103 Hey, Kim! What's up?
###3106 Hey. Hey, Tara, erm...
###3109 Just... taking a break.
###3113 Well, like they say, if it were easy...
###3119 You guys ready? Let's go.
###3124 Right, come on, buster.
###3127 It's been a long day, Betty. Take it easy.
###3143 Hey, watch and learn, my friend!
###3146 Betty, wait up! it's too soon!
###3155 Whoa!
###3174 I think that's enough carrots.
###3179 Why give up now after you've worked so hard?
###3182 - Because I don't feel like it, OK? - It's just a sprain.
###3186 This time. Then next time I break my neck. Then what?
###3188 People die doing this stuff.
###3190 - I thought you needed the money. - I do.
###3192 Maybe if I hadn't spent it renting ski kit
###3195 and replacing stupid speakers, which we haven't paid for yet...
###3198 Jesus, Kim, we're meant to be having fun.
###3210 Hello, this is Kim Matthews"s phone. Leave a message after the tone. Bye!
###3217 Cheer up, babe. It might never happen.
###3219 It has. It continues to.
###3223 Do you know what you need to do?
###3226 Drink bleach? Good idea.
###3228 Two capfuls. Bucket. Hot water.
###3230 You know what they say, don't you? Tidy kitchen, tidy mind.
###3239 I just feel like I'm losing her.
###3242 People change. Change is good.
###3246 Where's her mum, then?
###3249 Sutton Row Cemetery. Change isn't always good.
###3259 Two capfuls?
###3264 Yo-ho, snow-ho!
###3268 - How's your arm? - it's alright. it's getting there.
###3272 The doctor said it'll be fine in a few days.
###3274 Oh. Wow, she can talk to me now, right?
###3277 Now that Captain America isn't calling her 50 times a day.
###3280 I need my training buddy. They started building the course for the pro.
###3284 - You wanna take a sneaky peeky? - No, I can't.
###3287 We've got corporate guests. Big weekend.
###3290 One hour? You've got to do this.
###3296 Betty, you on a board, it's where you're meant to be.
###3300 You've got so much talent it's unfair on the rest of us, so why...
###3306 Betty...
###3310 Sorry, Mikki. I can't.
###3322 Bye.
###3328 - Thank you, Kate. - Dad, her name's Kim.
###3330 Where's that one from last year, Dickie? Really big tits, big arse?
###3334 Henry Goodwin? He went bust, didn't you hear?
###3336 - You prick! The chalet girl. - Milly broke her leg.
###3339 - What, skiing? - Aprés-skiing.
###3341 You're too lean for my taste. We'll have to fatten you up, love.
###3345 Yeah, a bit more cushion for the pushin'.
###3350 - They tip well. - They'd better.
###3352 We need Malcolm to come in first.
###3354 40 mill, 50 maybe. The others will follow.
###3357 - You worry too much. - You don't worry enough.
###3359 Dickie, shift your arse! - Right. Let's get going.
###3363 Georgie, you're coming with us to dish up lunch?
###3365 Erm, actually I've come down with something.
###3369 It's like a little tickle. It's like...
###3374 Oh. Well, you'd better come, then, erm...
###3377 - Oh, Dad, for God's sake, it's Kim. - Kim.
###3379 No, I should be...
###3382 Ow.
###3384 Fine. I'll get changed and get my lift pass.
###3388 You don't need a lift pass.
###3391 How can you not need a lift pass?
###3396 Ah.
###3399 You ever been in one of these things?
###3401 Yeah, we got one at home. This one's pretty small.
###3404 - Do we pay extra for irony? - No, the irony's free.
###3407 - It's the sarcasm you're paying for.
###3410 Ironically.
###3428 Oh, wow.
###3430 - How long have you been on that thing? - About eight weeks.
###3434 Jesus. Dickie...
###3436 You can fly back on the bird if you're not sure.
###3439 - She's fine. Trust me. - I don't want her holding us up.
###3457 The global financial meltdown just happened to other people, right?
###3462 I warned you about sub-primes. Greed is only good when it comes to lunch.
###3466 Speaking of which, what is this?
###3468 Special Austrian food. Strudel, nudel and... kniidel.
###3473 I wouldn't mind a "canoodle" with this one in fact.
###3478 Right, nearest the pin, lads. it's 50s in and it's...
###3481 I'm going to go 32C.
###3483 It's hard to tell. The jumper might be bulking her up.
###3486 Put me down for a 30B.
###3488 Miles off. I'm thinking 30D, the Holy Grail of bra sizes.
###3491 Controversial. Go on, Kimmy, put us out of our misery.
###3495 No, Kim, don't answer that.
###3498 I'm sorry. I was under the impression that we were enjoying ourselves.
###3501 Unlike most women you know, Malcolm, Kim keeps her clothes on for a living.
###3505 Oh.
###3506 It's alright. You know what they say.
###3508 The bigger the chat, the smaller the chap.
###3513 New game. Waistlines. Malcolm?
###3519 Fantastic weekend, Dickie.
###3521 Flattery will get you nowhere
###3524 but some fresh powder and a couple of tasty chalet tarts will get you 40 mill.
###3530 - Dad, wait. - Forgotten your hair-care products?
###3535 Actually, I was thinking about staying a couple more days if it's OK.
###3539 Hey, do your thing. Back for the weekend, obviously?
###3543 Yeah, of course.
###3547 I'll see you guys soon.
###3551 There's, like, 400 euros here. Should think so too. Bloody perverts.
###3554 Jonny didn't ask us to pay him back for...
###3557 Thanks for reminding me.
###3563 - Oh, and you. Yes.
###3570 OK, so that you can earn yours back, I want to hire you.
###3574 50 euros an hour.
###3577 Not like that.
###3582 - Need a hand? The meter's running. - No.
###3585 That's three euros right there. Well, it's your money.
###3588 Actually, it's mine now. Again.
###3590 Show me what's so great about boarding. Let's get gnarled.
###3593 - Gnarly. - Whatever. Sick, phat, ill.
###3596 You sound like a doctor.
###3601 - Holy shit, I'm a natural. - Shut up, snoogles.
###3608 Move back into position.
###3610 -Watch this one. - Now concentrate.
###3613 -OK. - Idiot.
###3615 I think you mean, "Concentrate, please, valued paying customer."
###3621 - Oops. - Owl
###3624 - OK, that was an accident. - I'm not going to be your bit of fun.
###3631 -Go on, then. - Yes, yes, yes.
###3636 Come on, loser. I'll show you how it's done.
###3647 Yes!
###3649 So you have a pretty rough life, huh?
###3652 - Hideous, isn't it? -I don't know how you stand it.
###3655 It's not all it's cracked up to be.
###3657 I've heard that having loads of money can be a real let-down.
###3662 You think I could do anything I want to?
###3666 Truth is, my dad's been saving a place for me on the board since I was two
###3670 and my mother won't be happy until I've married Chloe
###3673 and have nine children with perfect teeth.
###3676 They've got it all planned out for me
###3678 and I'm, like, "This is it? This is my life?"
###3684 No, nice try, but not quite.
###3687 Oh, angst. The rich kid's alternative to real problems.
###3690 Sarcasm. The chalet girl's alternative to real humour. I know I'm lucky...
###3694 "But I'm stuck in this caged existence
###3697 of vintage champagne and luxury ski chalets
###3699 when I just want to be a pop star."
###3701 Rock star.
###3710 - Why don't you just do it, then? - it's just not that simple.
###3716 - What? - it's nothing.
###3719 No, what? Go on.
###3722 It's just a bit silly. My mum always used to say,
###3724 "You've got brains in your head, feet in your shoes."
###3728 "You can steer yourself in any direction you choose."
###3734 Clever girl, your mum.
###3741 Yeah. We should get going.
###3744 Yeah.
###3747 I hope you know what you're doing.
###3751 - Excuse me? - I'm just saying.
###3753 The season ends, he goes back to his world, you go back to yours.
###3757 What are you left with?
###3758 My world? Where exactly is that? Pluto?
###3762 - No, that's not what I meant. - Don't judge me by your standards.
###3766 You'd rather be with a rich idiot like Nigel
###3768 instead of Mikki who you are clearly in love with.
###3771 - I'm going for a beer. - There's something you need to know.
###3775 I think I'm done on the friendly advice for now, thanks.
###3779 It'd be better if you just stay out of it, OK?
###3786 Do you want to talk about it? A barman's cheaper than a shrink.
###3790 A beer's cheaper than a barman.
###3793 - I'm pretty cheap. - Beer doesn't talk back either.
###3820 Hey. Are you OK?
###3822 - She told you where I was, then? - I'm staying out of it.
###3827 Look, about us...
###3831 Night, Jonny.
###3834 What I really came to say was I booked the helicopter again.
###3840 I need someone to serve me lunch.
###3844 You are so annoying.
###3859 I I feel sweet
###3861 J' Do you feel sweet?
###3863 .P It's amazing
###3869 J' I have no skin, and I feel everything
###3873 .P It's amazing
###3879 I I've wanted this for so long
###3881 I Now the deed has been done
###3884 I We shall rise with the sun
###3887 J' Spend our time as one
###3898 I Now there is no sin in anything
###3902 .P it's life-changing
###3905 J' This feeling
###3919 J' This feeling
###3926 J' This feeling
###3931 .P It's amazing
###3937 J* From now on
###3940 J* From now on
###3942 J* We are one
###3945 .P It's amazing
###3947 J* it's in the stars, in the sun
###3950 .P it's everywhere, in everyone
###3952 I And it will be every day
###3957 J* From now on
###3961 J* We are one
###3964 .P It's amazing
###3967 It's like pass the parcel.
###3971 34B. Knew it.
###3991 Wh at?
###3994 Nothing.
###4007 Would it freak you out if I said that was the best day of my life?
###4012 OK, maybe not the best, but certainly top... five.
###4020 What is with you people walking in on me naked?
###4023 I think the idea was you stayed below stairs, young lady.
###4027 And you, don't you have an engagement party to go to?
###4033 For a second there I thought she meant...
###4038 Oh.
###4054 - I did try to tell you. -it's not hard.
###4056 "Did you hear Jonny proposed to Chloe?"
###4059 "No. Thanks for letting me know, chum."
###4061 I didn't want to see you get hurt.
###4063 Yeah, you just did a spiffing job all round, didn't you?
###4067 She's a chalet girl. My God, it is such a cliché.
###4071 I wouldn't have minded so much if you were discreet
###4074 but Bernhardt said you were all over each other, on the beginner slope!
###4077 Bernhardt could learn a few things about being discreet himself.
###4081 Honey, do you realise what you're risking here?
###4084 You have to stop this right now, or I will.
###4086 This isn't Jane Austen, Mum. Look, when you and Dad met...
###4090 Enough, Jonathan.
###4093 I just think you can do better.
###4095 Well, I don't think Dad could have done better.
###4099 Look, your father and I, we got lucky.
###4102 But believe me, this girl is only after one thing.
###4106 Yeah. And it was great.
###4108 - Is there a reason you're still here? - Look, Kim, can we just...
###4111 There's a noise. I can't quite... Oh, that's right, it's a lying bastard.
###4116 Yeah. OK.
###4119 Erm, well, look, I owe you... three hours.
###4128 Shit.
###4129 Kim! Kim, wait! Kim!
###4136 Kim!
###4152 About 8:30 tomorrow. I'll cook you a nice tea to celebrate.
###4155 - What about the competition? -I was never going to win.
###4158 It's fine. I can come back and sort you out.
###4160 I've lasted three months. I'm sure I can manage another week.
###4163 Dad, I looked online at your latest order. 24 tins of beans?
###4169 Are you giving up the chance of a lifetime
###4171 because I'm eating too many baked beans?
###4173 Someone's got to take care of you.
###4175 Oh, no, you don't. Don't you dare do that, Kimmy.
###4178 Don't you put this on me. This is your decision.
###4181 Anyway, since when did my Kimmy ever say there was no way
###4185 she was gonna win something?
###4187 I'll tell you something else, Kimberley.
###4191 What, William?
###4194 It's what she would have wanted.
###4198 Hallo. Was bekommst du?
###4202 Erm, what do you want?
###4214 It's a beautiful spring morning here in St Anton,
###4217 perfect conditions for the open qualifiers!
###4221 Come on! Come on!
###4229 ranks with a kicker.
###4232 Mixing things up
###4235 and finishing off with a super styley 540
###4237 that should see him through to the weekend's final.
###4240 And there it is, a 73! That sends Hampton through.
###4245 Next up, from Finland, Mikki Niemenan!
###4250 - That's you, champ. - Is Georgie out there?
###4253 Well, don't think about her. Think about the run. Only the run.
###4257 Be the board.
###4263 Go!
###4269 hammers those rails!
###4273 Niemenan showing some impressive skills.
###4277 Switch 50-50, backside 180.
###4280 Sweet! Coming up to the booter where he fell last year.
###4284 Hits it, going for broke!
###4287 Whoa!
###4292 And broke it is!
###4294 He's up, but he's going to have a monster headache in the morning.
###4299 - You sure you want this? - Just do it.
###4301 And in the ladies' qualifiers now...
###4304 Don't worry, it's legal.
###4310 - Better than sex too. - ..Tara Dakides!
###4314 A solid 50-50 on the goalpost. Boom!
###4319 She spread some butter on the box!
###4323 And a frontside seven lean!
###4328 A master class from the master!
###4330 The Greek goddess!
###4333 Whatever, man! She is awesome!
###4337 The Queen of Scream is back!
###4340 - Ow! - Now, last up, strapped in,
###4343 trying to follow an amazing run, newcomer Kim Matthews.
###4346 Let's see what she has got!
###4348 Drei, zwei, eins. Go!
###4354 A front 180 to switch tail, a 180 out!
###4358 Textbook awesomeness!
###4361 A silky tail press. Nice one, Matthews!
###4366 Throwing an indy grab coming off the box!
###4371 And here she goes now, coming up to the big booter!
###4381 What's happened there?
###4383 She's stopped short and takes the lame line down.
###4387 Kim might have done just enough on the top section to get into the main event.
###4392 Oh, no. 59, just outside qualification.
###4396 Kim will be back on finals day,
###4398 but she'll have to wait and see if she gets a ride.
###4401 I came 21 st. Yay!
###4403 That's great. How many qualify?
###4406 The top 20. So, suddenly, not so yay. I am first reserve though.
###4410 - I get a chance if someone pulls out. - You gave it your best shot though.
###4416 - Dad, I've got to go. - OK, bye.
###4419 Bye.
###4421 - Finland!
###4424 Morphine rules!
###4426 It's just ligaments, thank God.
###4433 Oh, piss off! Again.
###4512 -Hi.
###4519 So you are the Yeti.
###4523 Must be the hair.
###4559 Want to talk about it?
###4566 No.
###4569 It's just something that...
###4583 Er...
###4585 We were...
###4587 We were driving home, and, erm...
###4589 I'd just won the London Trials
###4591 and... all of us in the car,
###4594 me and my mum and dad,
###4596 were singing at the top of our voices
###4598 and we were all laughing cos none of us can sing for shit.
###4601 And, erm...
###4605 Er...
###4607 My dad had to swerve, and...
###4611 And he skidded off the road.
###4617 And my...
###4621 My mum was on the side that got hit, and...
###4628 And she died.
###4632 My mum died.
###4639 I just really miss her.
###4653 Sorry. I'm so sorry.
###4657 I always get like this when I'm around Yetis.
###4666 Let's ride.
###4671 I always tell the mountains my problems. They're good listeners.
###4724 Two minutes. I'm going to go and tell the caterers.
###4734 Jonathan!
###4735 Deidre and I would like to say...
###4738 Lord and Lady Marberry, can I get you another drink?
###4740 Well, why not? Good to see you.
###4745 If you've got to do it, do it now.
###4752 He had it the entire time we were there and I had no idea. Such a surprise.
###4758 - Excuse me. Can I have a word? - Yeah.
###4761 Thanks.
###4763 What's up?
###4766 Wh at?
###4770 - What is it? - Erm...
###4772 I have an idea that I wanted to run by you.
###4778 How-How would you feel if we didn't get married?
###4782 How would that sit with you?
###4787 - Good idea. - Really? You're OK with this?
###4794 Of course I'm not OK with it.
###4798 - Look, I understand it's bad timing. - Do you really?
###4801 Ending a five-year relationship in the middle of our engagement party?
###4805 Yes, I think that constitutes bad timing!
###4811 - I'm sorry, I'm... - An asshole is what you are!
###4818 Exactly right. I am.
###4824 You're in love with her, aren't you?
###4831 Exactly right. I am.
###4845 Someday I will probably thank you for this,
###4847 for not going through with it just to please your mother.
###4853 But today...
###4863 Today, it's not quite how I'm feeling.
###4868 Here, I got you some ice for the swelling.
###4874 They're gonna blow up.
###4880 Come on, let's go.
###4883 - And for your next trick... - You're not upset?
###4886 She's lovely, but I trust you.
###4888 - Your mother, on the other hand... - (wine glass tings)
###4894 Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the happy couple.
###4898 In the unlikely event of an emergency landing,
###4900 the cabin crew will direct you to the nearest available exit.
###4903 It was like love at first sight.
###4905 They were kids, if you can believe that.
###4909 OK, baby. Let's get you drunk.
###4915 Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
###4919 Yeah, laters, babe. Yeah.
###4921 Oh, my God! You guys are never going to believe
###4924 what happened to Jonny and Chloe.
###4925 Apparently there was this major showdown at their engagement party.
###4929 Hattie says Chloe dumped Jonny in front of everyone
###4932 and Jonny stormed out.
###4934 But Pips also tweeted that it was Jonny who broke up with Chloe
###4937 and Chloe just passed out, right there.
###4940 Either way, it was just super-dramatic, right?
###4949 Wh at?
###4951 I couldn't care less.
###4957 Welcome to Channel 419, broadcasting live from St Anton, Austria.
