'The novelist Aldous Huxley
once wrote


3
0:0:15,32 --> 0:0:17,36
'that most human beings
behave as though


4
0:0:17,36 --> 0:0:25,56
'death were no more than
an unfounded rumour.


5
0:0:25,56 --> 0:0:31,48
'But what happens when you realise
the rumour is true?'


6
0:0:31,48 --> 0:0:32,84
'Let's face it, none of us,


7
0:0:32,84 --> 0:0:36,92
'until it hits us in the face,
think we're going to die.


8
0:0:36,92 --> 0:0:39,56
'I can still sort of picture
the consultant's room.

0:0:39,56 --> 0:0:42,2
'He said, "Well,
I've got some bad news for you.


10
0:0:42,2 --> 0:0:46,0
'"We think you've got
motor neurone disease."'

0:0:46,0 --> 0:0:50,64
'As we film this, Richard Chell
has only months to live.


12
0:0:50,64 --> 0:0:53,36
'His comfort lies
in his religious faith.


13
0:0:53,36 --> 0:0:57,56
'For him, death is not the end.'


14
0:0:57,56 --> 0:0:59,68
Death, to me,
the actual process of dying,


15
0:0:59,68 --> 0:1:2,64
is not something I'm scared of.
For me, it's going through


16
0:1:2,64 --> 0:1:3,92
a door into another room.


17
0:1:3,92 --> 0:1:5,2
What do you mean by that?


18
0:1:5,2 --> 0:1:8,4
I'm a Christian and therefore
I do believe in a life after death.


19
0:1:8,4 --> 0:1:12,36
I do believe that this life
is just part of a process,


20
0:1:12,36 --> 0:1:15,52
and that there's another part
of that process to complete.


21
0:1:15,52 --> 0:1:18,56
I know very well your feelings
about on religion and the rest of it.


22
0:1:18,56 --> 0:1:20,28
But I would say


23
0:1:20,28 --> 0:1:22,72
having a view that is finite


24
0:1:22,72 --> 0:1:25,76
is a bit like having half a meal.


25
0:1:25,76 --> 0:1:27,68
It will leave you hungry
at the end of the day.


26
0:1:27,68 --> 0:1:30,0
But, of course,
the existence of hunger


27
0:1:30,0 --> 0:1:32,32
doesn't mean that there's food.


28
0:1:32,32 --> 0:1:34,44
No, but it means that there's a need.


29
0:1:34,44 --> 0:1:36,84
And I would argue that
there is a food.


30
0:1:36,84 --> 0:1:39,24
If you faced a situation where,


31
0:1:39,24 --> 0:1:41,16
like myself, say,
you were suddenly saying,


32
0:1:41,16 --> 0:1:45,12
"Well, look. Death is fairly close
and you're going to die."


33
0:1:45,12 --> 0:1:48,4
Do you think you would feel
any differently?


34
0:1:48,4 --> 0:1:50,8
Or are you clear in your own mind,
if that was the situation,


35
0:1:50,8 --> 0:1:57,72
"I know exactly how I'd respond
and exactly how I'd feel"?


36
0:1:57,72 --> 0:2:1,2
'It is a fair question.


37
0:2:1,2 --> 0:2:5,68
'I follow reason
and I don't believe in God.


38
0:2:5,68 --> 0:2:10,4
'But this series is not about
whether God exists or not.


39
0:2:10,4 --> 0:2:12,96
'It's about
a more difficult problem -


40
0:2:12,96 --> 0:2:18,28
'what, if anything,
can take God's place?


41
0:2:18,28 --> 0:2:21,72
'Religion has shaped
our understanding of life


42
0:2:21,72 --> 0:2:24,72
'for thousands of years.


43
0:2:24,72 --> 0:2:27,8
'Ideas of the soul,


44
0:2:27,8 --> 0:2:30,48

45
0:2:30,48 --> 0:2:33,64
'and the afterlife

46
0:2:33,64 --> 0:2:37,76
'even for non-religious people
like me.


47
0:2:37,76 --> 0:2:41,52
'As more and more of us
realise there is no God,


48
0:2:41,52 --> 0:2:46,24
'what happens as we leave
religion behind?'


49
0:2:46,24 --> 0:2:48,84
I have to believe there's a plan,


50
0:2:48,84 --> 0:2:51,64
and that God is going to
accomplish something through this.


51
0:2:51,64 --> 0:2:54,6
I suppose Jesus is
an unpaid babysitter.


52
0:2:54,6 --> 0:2:56,92
It's like, "If I'm not watching you,
Jesus is."


53
0:2:56,92 --> 0:3:1,8
So do you think that we,
in the West, are too materialistic?


54
0:3:1,8 --> 0:3:3,48
I think so.


55
0:3:3,48 --> 0:3:5,64
'In this film, Death,


56
0:3:5,64 --> 0:3:9,4
'religion has traditionally
been thought to bring comfort


57
0:3:9,4 --> 0:3:12,4
'at the end of life.


58
0:3:12,4 --> 0:3:15,88
'But does it really?


59
0:3:15,88 --> 0:3:22,4
'What can science
and reason tell us?'


60
0:3:22,4 --> 0:3:50,12
How does someone like me,
who has no religion, face death?


61
0:3:50,12 --> 0:3:52,8
'Varanasi, India -


62
0:3:52,8 --> 0:3:58,76
'one of the oldest cities
in the world.


63
0:3:58,76 --> 0:4:3,28
'It has a macabre speciality.


64
0:4:3,28 --> 0:4:12,8
'Its main business
is the industry of death.


65
0:4:12,8 --> 0:4:16,12
'Every year, a million
Hindu pilgrims visit Varanasi,


66
0:4:16,12 --> 0:4:18,84
'dragging with them
some 40,000 corpses


67
0:4:18,84 --> 0:4:29,64
'to be cremated
on the banks of the Ganges.'


68
0:4:29,64 --> 0:4:33,44
This the holiest place
in the whole of Hinduism.


69
0:4:33,44 --> 0:4:37,56
This is the place where Hindus
aspire to come to die,


70
0:4:37,56 --> 0:4:41,72
to escape from the cycle
of birth and death and rebirth.


71
0:4:41,72 --> 0:4:43,6
It is the most amazing scene.


72
0:4:43,6 --> 0:4:48,64
It's probably been going on like
this for centuries, even millennia.


73
0:4:48,64 --> 0:4:51,2
It looks as though
there are ashes down here


74
0:4:51,2 --> 0:5:3,6
in the river, swirling around.


75
0:5:3,6 --> 0:5:7,16
'As an atheist for whom death
is a full stop,


76
0:5:7,16 --> 0:5:10,92
'I suppose I shouldn't feel
sentimental about the carcasses.


77
0:5:10,92 --> 0:5:24,56
'They are ex-people
who have ceased to be.


78
0:5:24,56 --> 0:5:28,68
'Yet I find something
a little bit shocking here.


79
0:5:28,68 --> 0:5:32,8
'The partially-burnt corpses...


80
0:5:32,8 --> 0:5:34,48
'..the locals casually searching for


81
0:5:34,48 --> 0:5:40,64
'precious metals

82
0:5:40,64 --> 0:5:48,84
'..and the rejected dead.'


83
0:5:48,84 --> 0:5:51,76
Although this is
clearly steeped in religion,


84
0:5:51,76 --> 0:5:56,84
there's a surprising lack
of evident reverence or solemnity.


85
0:5:56,84 --> 0:5:59,48
The people standing around
the funeral pyres


86
0:5:59,48 --> 0:6:6,0
are doing the job of work
in a pretty matter-of-fact way.


87
0:6:6,0 --> 0:6:12,8
'But there is a kind of logic behind
the apparent lack of reverence.


88
0:6:12,8 --> 0:6:17,16
'In this religious tradition,
the flesh is no longer important.


89
0:6:17,16 --> 0:6:25,36
'What matters here is
releasing the spirit or soul.


90
0:6:25,36 --> 0:6:28,76
'This is where religion
plays its strongest card.


91
0:6:28,76 --> 0:6:35,28
'The body may not live for ever
but the soul does.


92
0:6:35,28 --> 0:6:38,6
'On the face of it,
it's a comforting idea.


93
0:6:38,6 --> 0:6:52,24
'And a challenge
for an atheist like me.


94
0:6:52,24 --> 0:6:56,32
'If you want to hear the challenge
starkly expressed,


95
0:6:56,32 --> 0:7:2,52
'you can go to a place like this
in Kansas City.'


96
0:7:2,52 --> 0:7:6,12
Hello, I'm Richard.


97
0:7:6,12 --> 0:7:9,4
'This Catholic hospice,
Alexandra's House,


98
0:7:9,4 --> 0:7:14,2
'is for babies who die
within hours of birth.'


99
0:7:14,2 --> 0:7:16,76
These are clearly fatal disorders.


100
0:7:16,76 --> 0:7:18,52
Babies perhaps with anencephaly,


101
0:7:18,52 --> 0:7:21,64
Potter's Syndrome,
where they have no kidneys,


102
0:7:21,64 --> 0:7:23,88
severe genetic heart disease.


103
0:7:23,88 --> 0:7:25,48
So, they're all going to die.


104
0:7:25,48 --> 0:7:26,36
They're all going to die.


105
0:7:26,36 --> 0:7:28,96
They're all going to die.
And so, the normal recommendation
by the medical profession


106
0:7:28,96 --> 0:7:30,32
would be probably be an abortion
at that point, would it?


107
0:7:30,32 --> 0:7:32,96
would be probably be an abortion
at that point, would it?
Yes.


108
0:7:32,96 --> 0:7:36,44
This may, you know,
be hard for some people to see.


109
0:7:36,44 --> 0:7:39,4
These are many of our babies
for whom we've cared,


110
0:7:39,4 --> 0:7:42,28
some who have lived here,
but all of them that we've cared for.


111
0:7:42,28 --> 0:7:48,32
And so this is leading us up
to where the families stay.


112
0:7:48,32 --> 0:7:49,92
This is where the parents stay.


113
0:7:49,92 --> 0:7:52,32
'Over the last 11 years, Patti Lewis


114
0:7:52,32 --> 0:7:56,4
'has helped the families
of over 500 babies


115
0:7:56,4 --> 0:7:59,2
'who have died within these walls.'


116
0:7:59,2 --> 0:8:2,84
Do you think their mothers are ever
going to meet their babies again?


117
0:8:2,84 --> 0:8:4,2
Yes.


118
0:8:4,2 --> 0:8:5,88
I think the mothers believe that,
too,


119
0:8:5,88 --> 0:8:13,24
and the fathers and the siblings.


120
0:8:13,24 --> 0:8:16,52
'I do sympathise with the desire
to meet again


121
0:8:16,52 --> 0:8:18,8
'somebody whom you've known
and loved.


122
0:8:18,8 --> 0:8:20,52
'But a newborn baby?


123
0:8:20,52 --> 0:8:23,8
'I feel very sorry
for these parents,


124
0:8:23,8 --> 0:8:26,2
'but still, reality may be raw.


125
0:8:26,2 --> 0:8:30,12
'But we have to face it.


126
0:8:30,12 --> 0:8:34,48
The baby was born on Saturday,
7/9/11.


127
0:8:34,48 --> 0:8:36,32
Which was yesterday.


128
0:8:36,32 --> 0:8:39,24
Yeah.


129
0:8:39,24 --> 0:8:41,0
And she came into the world at 6pm


130
0:8:41,0 --> 0:8:42,96
and she lived 30 minutes.


131
0:8:42,96 --> 0:8:48,28
And those 30 minutes seemed so short
and so precious.


132
0:8:48,28 --> 0:8:51,52
We held her and loved her and...


133
0:8:51,52 --> 0:8:56,8
got to give her a little bath and
put her in her christening outfit.


134
0:8:56,8 --> 0:8:58,48
We baptised her.


135
0:8:58,48 --> 0:9:4,64
The family was there with us,
and it was a very precious time.


136
0:9:4,64 --> 0:9:7,0
Can you talk us through
when you first found out


137
0:9:7,0 --> 0:9:11,24
that there was a problem
with the baby?


138
0:9:11,24 --> 0:9:16,4
We found out in January that we were
expecting and it would be our third.


139
0:9:16,4 --> 0:9:18,44
And we were overjoyed.
And we go in for our ultrasound


140
0:9:18,44 --> 0:9:20,88
and find out
if it was a boy or girl.


141
0:9:20,88 --> 0:9:22,96
She did the scan
and told us there was no kidneys.


142
0:9:22,96 --> 0:9:24,52
No kidneys? Right.


143
0:9:24,52 --> 0:9:28,4
That was the first time that
we had heard that diagnosis.


144
0:9:28,4 --> 0:9:31,0
And she called it
a "lethal pregnancy".


145
0:9:31,0 --> 0:9:33,76
So, that's when you sort of
went into shock, is it?


146
0:9:33,76 --> 0:9:35,16
More so, yes.


147
0:9:35,16 --> 0:9:39,44
Did it occur to you that
the total sum of suffering would be


148
0:9:39,44 --> 0:9:43,56
much less if you drew a line under
it then and restarted you life?


149
0:9:43,56 --> 0:9:46,68
You've got to restart your life now.


150
0:9:46,68 --> 0:9:51,44
Why did you decide to go on
for the remaining months?


151
0:9:51,44 --> 0:9:55,6
Well, there's hope in everything
and God can do great things.


152
0:9:55,6 --> 0:9:57,68
So, you were hoping for a miracle?


153
0:9:57,68 --> 0:9:59,48
Hoping for a miracle,
but if it wasn't,


154
0:9:59,48 --> 0:10:2,8
it was still going to be precious
and it's a baby and it's a life.


155
0:10:2,8 --> 0:10:7,8
It's not my decision to
terminate that. It's not my choice.


156
0:10:7,8 --> 0:10:13,4
I carried it and loved it and can
feel it move every single day and...


157
0:10:13,4 --> 0:10:17,28
And also the 30 minutes or so that
we got to spend with her was worth,


158
0:10:17,28 --> 0:10:21,12
I didn't have any of the pain,
but I would say it was worth


159
0:10:21,12 --> 0:10:24,92
all of the trial of getting to
where we were.


160
0:10:24,92 --> 0:10:27,4
And not only did we get to
spend 30 minutes with her


161
0:10:27,4 --> 0:10:29,88
we got to be with
her for, like, 12 hours,


162
0:10:29,88 --> 0:10:33,96
she wasn't with us spiritually,
but we got to hold her.


163
0:10:33,96 --> 0:10:35,8
And you took photographs? &gt;


164
0:10:35,8 --> 0:10:37,72
Oh, yes.


165
0:10:37,72 --> 0:10:40,16
We have one that we
have printed off.


166
0:10:40,16 --> 0:10:43,12
She was beautiful,
she was perfect and everything...


167
0:10:43,12 --> 0:10:46,8
&lt; She looked just like her mom
even down to her fingernails.


168
0:10:46,8 --> 0:10:48,76
Yes, beautiful.


169
0:10:48,76 --> 0:10:51,32
I wouldn't have changed
it for anything.


170
0:10:51,32 --> 0:10:53,96
Do you think you will ever
meet the baby? &gt;


171
0:10:53,96 --> 0:10:57,92
Oh, of course, there is
great hope in that.


172
0:10:57,92 --> 0:11:8,64
We will meet the baby,
it's in heaven with God.


173
0:11:8,64 --> 0:11:11,8
'I feel for Runae and Lee.


174
0:11:11,8 --> 0:11:13,88
'They sincerely think they are
gaining reassurance


175
0:11:13,88 --> 0:11:20,92
'from their faith.


176
0:11:20,92 --> 0:11:24,16
'So now, I need to understand how
this relationship


177
0:11:24,16 --> 0:11:43,12
'between death and religion has
evolved to be so strong.'


178
0:11:43,12 --> 0:11:47,36
Religion denies death is real.


179
0:11:47,36 --> 0:11:51,8
It sets up, instead,
the forbidding prospect of eternity


180
0:11:51,8 --> 0:11:54,52
either in heaven, or worse,
in hell.


181
0:11:54,52 --> 0:11:58,24
For me, what's frightening
is not death itself but eternity,


182
0:11:58,24 --> 0:12:0,8
whether you're there or not.


183
0:12:0,8 --> 0:12:3,72
Yet people still reach instinctively
for religion and its rituals


184
0:12:3,72 --> 0:12:6,8
when it comes to the end.


185
0:12:6,8 --> 0:12:10,8
Why?


186
0:12:10,8 --> 0:12:13,4
It's a very, very artificial
situation.


187
0:12:13,4 --> 0:12:15,6
We see the person lying down.


188
0:12:15,6 --> 0:12:18,44
Unless you're intimately acquainted
with someone,


189
0:12:18,44 --> 0:12:20,44
you don't really see them lying down


190
0:12:20,44 --> 0:12:23,4
and they may well be dressed
in their own clothes


191
0:12:23,4 --> 0:12:26,76
lying down with their eyes closed
in an artificial situation


192
0:12:26,76 --> 0:12:29,0
that they're inside a wooden box.


193
0:12:29,0 --> 0:12:32,4
Now, all of these things
bring a surrealism,


194
0:12:32,4 --> 0:12:36,24
but despite that,
people are very, very focused


195
0:12:36,24 --> 0:12:40,8
on the fact that the last physical
connection they have with that person


196
0:12:40,8 --> 0:12:46,28
is lying in that coffin, and that's
what they're saying farewell to.


197
0:12:46,28 --> 0:12:53,2
So why do people go on
with these strange rituals?


198
0:12:53,2 --> 0:12:57,76
It's the business of walking away
from the funeral and feeling,


199
0:12:57,76 --> 0:13:1,88
"That was well done,
we liked what they've done for us


200
0:13:1,88 --> 0:13:6,16
"and we feel that we laid someone
we cared about very deeply to rest


201
0:13:6,16 --> 0:13:8,88
"in a very dignified
and meaningful way."


202
0:13:8,88 --> 0:13:13,8
And even if the beautiful oak coffin
is then burned or buried,


203
0:13:13,8 --> 0:13:16,6
somehow you feel you've given
the person a good send-off.


204
0:13:16,6 --> 0:13:24,72
Very much so.


205
0:13:24,72 --> 0:13:31,48
More and more of us have no faith
in God but we cling to the rituals.


206
0:13:31,48 --> 0:13:35,2
Even in secular
woodland burial sites,


207
0:13:35,2 --> 0:13:40,4
we find death brings
illogical superstition.


208
0:13:40,4 --> 0:13:44,64
It is fascinating
to see people thinking of themselves


209
0:13:44,64 --> 0:13:47,12
as part of this place.


210
0:13:47,12 --> 0:13:50,28
They're anticipating
their postmortem identity.


211
0:13:50,28 --> 0:13:53,6
So that when people talk about,
as they can in this place,


212
0:13:53,6 --> 0:13:55,0
facing any direction,


213
0:13:55,0 --> 0:13:57,84
so some want to look up the hill,
some want to look down the hill,


214
0:13:57,84 --> 0:13:59,8
some want to look towards the sun,


215
0:13:59,8 --> 0:14:3,32
they are buried
in different spatial directions.


216
0:14:3,32 --> 0:14:6,24
'Douglas Davies is an anthropologist


217
0:14:6,24 --> 0:14:10,52
'fascinated by the fuss
and trappings surrounding death.'


218
0:14:10,52 --> 0:14:12,76
Do you think a part
of what's going on


219
0:14:12,76 --> 0:14:16,64
is a reluctance to believe
that the dead person is really dead?


220
0:14:16,64 --> 0:14:19,88
Yes. One lady, her father
used to farm around here.


221
0:14:19,88 --> 0:14:23,32
And so he's been buried
looking up towards the hill,


222
0:14:23,32 --> 0:14:26,56
cos he used to shoot rabbits up
there and the like,


223
0:14:26,56 --> 0:14:29,12
and to her,
this is dreadfully important


224
0:14:29,12 --> 0:14:31,4
because the relatives, too,


225
0:14:31,4 --> 0:14:32,84
are thinking about their dead
after they've died.


226
0:14:32,84 --> 0:14:35,36
are thinking about their dead
after they've died.
Yes.


227
0:14:35,36 --> 0:14:39,32
'I find I'm not immune
to these notions.'


228
0:14:39,32 --> 0:14:43,28
There's a place in Cornwall
where my mother's family come from


229
0:14:43,28 --> 0:14:47,2
and where we used to spend childhood
holidays called Dollar Cove.


230
0:14:47,2 --> 0:14:50,4
And I think I'm right in saying
there's a little tiny church


231
0:14:50,4 --> 0:14:54,56
more or less on the beach,
more or less built in the sand,


232
0:14:54,56 --> 0:14:57,76
and I've sometimes fantasised
about being buried there


233
0:14:57,76 --> 0:15:1,0
somehow with the sea crashing in
and the tide coming in and out.


234
0:15:1,0 --> 0:15:4,2
What is the allure
that would be there for you


235
0:15:4,2 --> 0:15:6,12
in a location for your body?


236
0:15:6,12 --> 0:15:9,24
It's totally illogical.
It's pure sentimentality.


237
0:15:9,24 --> 0:15:12,8
I suppose there's no rational
defence for it whatever.


238
0:15:12,8 --> 0:15:16,76
One should say, "Just stick me
in a dustbin bag and throw me away."


239
0:15:16,76 --> 0:15:19,2
But you don't want to be
in a dustbin bag?


240
0:15:19,2 --> 0:15:21,56
No, that's right,
and it is pure sentiment.


241
0:15:21,56 --> 0:15:22,56
We are sentimental animals...


242
0:15:22,56 --> 0:15:23,52
We are sentimental animals...
Yes, absolutely.


243
0:15:23,52 --> 0:15:28,44
We are sentimental animals...
Yes, absolutely.
..as well as social animals.


244
0:15:28,44 --> 0:15:30,92
So why do even atheists like me


245
0:15:30,92 --> 0:15:38,36
carry around
this sentimental baggage?


246
0:15:38,36 --> 0:15:47,36
When did these illogical thoughts
first develop?


247
0:15:47,36 --> 0:15:50,76
As a child, I don't think I worried
about God looking down at me


248
0:15:50,76 --> 0:15:53,68
and seeing what I was doing.
I worried about ancestors.


249
0:15:53,68 --> 0:15:57,0
I worried about my great uncles
and great aunts


250
0:15:57,0 --> 0:16:1,28
looking down from heaven
and seeing everything that I did.


251
0:16:1,28 --> 0:16:6,96
Childish, perhaps, but don't
let's be too quick to dismiss it.


252
0:16:6,96 --> 0:16:8,36
Hello, Iggy. Whoops.


253
0:16:8,36 --> 0:16:9,36
CHILD LAUGHS


254
0:16:9,36 --> 0:16:11,16
CHILD LAUGHS
He doesn't want to come out
and play.


255
0:16:11,16 --> 0:16:13,4
(OK, OK, there we go...)


256
0:16:13,4 --> 0:16:17,12
'From an early age, we start to
believe that there's more to us


257
0:16:17,12 --> 0:16:19,92
'than just our physical bodies,


258
0:16:19,92 --> 0:16:22,2
'as this experiment reveals.'


259
0:16:22,2 --> 0:16:24,52
Shall we give him a little tickle?


260
0:16:24,52 --> 0:16:27,2
He's very sweet, isn't he?


261
0:16:27,2 --> 0:16:29,92
This is a fake machine
to fool children


262
0:16:29,92 --> 0:16:33,32
into thinking live beings
can be duplicated.


263
0:16:33,32 --> 0:16:36,64
MACHINE BUZZES


264
0:16:36,64 --> 0:16:40,6
There's Iggy.


265
0:16:40,6 --> 0:16:43,48
And there's Iggy.


266
0:16:43,48 --> 0:16:46,52
As scientists, we seem to be
committed to the view


267
0:16:46,52 --> 0:16:49,8
that if you could take a person
and make an exact copy,


268
0:16:49,8 --> 0:16:51,56
molecule by molecule,


269
0:16:51,56 --> 0:16:55,4
that copy would have exactly
the same thoughts and memories,


270
0:16:55,4 --> 0:16:57,68
would be the same person.


271
0:16:57,68 --> 0:17:0,4
But intuition rebels.


272
0:17:0,4 --> 0:17:4,4
We seem to want to believe that
there's some essence of ourselves,


273
0:17:4,4 --> 0:17:7,96
something that would not go across
with all those molecules,


274
0:17:7,96 --> 0:17:15,68
something that a religious person
might want to call a soul.


275
0:17:15,68 --> 0:17:19,76
This is an attempt to look at
an old philosophical problem,


276
0:17:19,76 --> 0:17:22,52
which is, imagine
if you could copy anything,


277
0:17:22,52 --> 0:17:27,52
and in these experiments, rather
than getting children to imagine it,


278
0:17:27,52 --> 0:17:28,76
we produce a machine


279
0:17:28,76 --> 0:17:32,4
which looks as if it can duplicate
and copy anything,


280
0:17:32,4 --> 0:17:36,72
a bit like a photocopier
for objects.


281
0:17:36,72 --> 0:17:38,16
Now there's two.


282
0:17:38,16 --> 0:17:39,96
It made two.


283
0:17:39,96 --> 0:17:41,24
It made two.


284
0:17:41,24 --> 0:17:44,36
We've shown in previous studies
they can believe it can copy toys


285
0:17:44,36 --> 0:17:47,72
very easily, but the question is,
would they really extend that


286
0:17:47,72 --> 0:17:50,32
to something like a living thing,
like a hamster?


287
0:17:50,32 --> 0:17:54,6
Shall we tell him your name?
Do you want to whisper?


288
0:17:54,6 --> 0:17:57,84
And so what copies over
is the body of the hamster,


289
0:17:57,84 --> 0:18:0,64
the ideas of a hamster,
the memories of the hamster?


290
0:18:0,64 --> 0:18:4,68
We believe the intuition is that
the physical object can be copied,


291
0:18:4,68 --> 0:18:7,0
and therefore the physical
body can be copied,


292
0:18:7,0 --> 0:18:10,12
but we're not so sure that children
think the mind can be copied.


293
0:18:10,12 --> 0:18:13,44
Just like adults, they have this
sense that maybe the mind


294
0:18:13,44 --> 0:18:15,8
is different to the physical body.


295
0:18:15,8 --> 0:18:18,6
The reason this is so interesting
is because if you believe the mind


296
0:18:18,6 --> 0:18:21,8
is separate to the physical body,
then it means if the body goes,


297
0:18:21,8 --> 0:18:24,2
then maybe the mind can stay on
and exist.


298
0:18:24,2 --> 0:18:28,4
And this allows for all sorts of
notions of spirits and the soul,


299
0:18:28,4 --> 0:18:31,8
as being something entirely
untethered to the physical world.


300
0:18:31,8 --> 0:18:34,56
Yes, disembodied ghosts after death


301
0:18:34,56 --> 0:18:39,92
or surviving death in other ways,
the soul goes on.


302
0:18:39,92 --> 0:18:44,8
So these young children believe
bodies can be copied but not minds.


303
0:18:44,8 --> 0:18:45,84
Shall we have a look?


304
0:18:45,84 --> 0:18:48,8
One...


305
0:18:48,8 --> 0:18:50,28
Two.  Two.


306
0:18:50,28 --> 0:18:53,64
They are already thinking there's
something in charge of each being


307
0:18:53,64 --> 0:18:55,88
that is unique.


308
0:18:55,88 --> 0:18:59,6
Something like a soul?


309
0:18:59,6 --> 0:19:1,56
Did this hamster see your picture?


310
0:19:1,56 --> 0:19:2,52
(Yes.)


311
0:19:2,52 --> 0:19:4,16
(Yes.)
Does it know what your picture is?


312
0:19:4,16 --> 0:19:5,68
(No.)


313
0:19:5,68 --> 0:19:9,52
Does this hamster know your name?


314
0:19:9,52 --> 0:19:11,36
Does  this  hamster know your name?


315
0:19:11,36 --> 0:19:13,16
(No.)


316
0:19:13,16 --> 0:19:16,32
Evolutionary psychology suggests


317
0:19:16,32 --> 0:19:20,12
that we have evolved
a sense of separate mind or soul


318
0:19:20,12 --> 0:19:24,12
because it's useful to us.


319
0:19:24,12 --> 0:19:26,96
Because the experience
of being in control of your body


320
0:19:26,96 --> 0:19:29,72
is so pervasive, you just feel
that you've made a decision,


321
0:19:29,72 --> 0:19:31,24
you'll have a cup of coffee,


322
0:19:31,24 --> 0:19:33,48
you feel like you're driving
this very complex machine.


323
0:19:33,48 --> 0:19:35,12
you feel like you're driving
this very complex machine.
Yes, you certainly do.


324
0:19:35,12 --> 0:19:37,72
If you didn't feel that you wouldn't
be very well adapted to the world.


325
0:19:37,72 --> 0:19:39,32
If you didn't feel that you wouldn't
be very well adapted to the world.
No, that's right.


326
0:19:39,32 --> 0:19:43,0
To be a fully functional animal,
which is what our ancestors were,


327
0:19:43,0 --> 0:19:47,8
hunting and feeding and running
and escaping from predators,


328
0:19:47,8 --> 0:20:2,28
you need to feel like a soul
that's in control of the body.


329
0:20:2,28 --> 0:20:5,4
This is one reason why
it's so hard to shake off


330
0:20:5,4 --> 0:20:8,76
the religious way of death.


331
0:20:8,76 --> 0:20:14,76
We are programmed to believe
in something like a soul.


332
0:20:14,76 --> 0:20:17,56
Now, of course,
I don't believe in a soul


333
0:20:17,56 --> 0:20:21,28
but I, too, have the feeling
that there is some sort of essence


334
0:20:21,28 --> 0:20:24,88
of Richard Dawkins
that makes me who I am...


335
0:20:24,88 --> 0:20:31,4
..that gives me
my unique personal identity.


336
0:20:31,4 --> 0:20:33,92
'To understand more about this,


337
0:20:33,92 --> 0:20:36,28
'I need to look at the role
our memories play,


338
0:20:36,28 --> 0:20:39,36
'with the person who's known me
longest ?


339
0:20:39,36 --> 0:20:43,44
'my mother.'


340
0:20:43,44 --> 0:20:46,4
So what have we got here?
We've got, um...


341
0:20:46,4 --> 0:20:47,24
Your first birthday party.


342
0:20:47,24 --> 0:20:49,4
Your first birthday party.
First birthday party.  Yes.


343
0:20:49,4 --> 0:20:53,48
Well, I've no memory of this at all.
That's presumably me, is it?


344
0:20:53,48 --> 0:20:55,4
Yes, that's you.


345
0:20:55,4 --> 0:20:59,16
In a little dress that your granny
sent out from England.


346
0:20:59,16 --> 0:21:6,52
'Our memories are hugely important
to our sense of who we are.'


347
0:21:6,52 --> 0:21:8,8
That's Kilimanjaro.


348
0:21:8,8 --> 0:21:10,12
Oh, yes.


349
0:21:10,12 --> 0:21:12,84
You used to like saying words
like Kilimanjaro.


350
0:21:12,84 --> 0:21:14,4
Oh, right.


351
0:21:14,4 --> 0:21:19,72
'But our memories lull us
into a false sense of certainty.


352
0:21:19,72 --> 0:21:24,52
'They are fallible,
riddled with errors.'


353
0:21:24,52 --> 0:21:28,8
Another early memory
was being stung by a scorpion.


354
0:21:28,8 --> 0:21:31,84
Yes, we were miles,
absolutely miles from anywhere,


355
0:21:31,84 --> 0:21:36,32
and you suddenly jumped off
your chair without your shoes on,


356
0:21:36,32 --> 0:21:38,92
which you weren't allowed to do,


357
0:21:38,92 --> 0:21:42,36
and stepped on a scorpion...


358
0:21:42,36 --> 0:21:44,64
..and Ali,


359
0:21:44,64 --> 0:21:47,24
our African boy,


360
0:21:47,24 --> 0:21:52,64
rushed in and got your foot and
squeezed it and sucked it for hours.


361
0:21:52,64 --> 0:21:55,4
Gosh! Good for Ali. Yes.


362
0:21:55,4 --> 0:21:56,8
Well, not hours but...


363
0:21:56,8 --> 0:22:0,88
And you were screaming. We had to
hold you while he sucked your foot...


364
0:22:0,88 --> 0:22:4,4
Yes. I...
My memory is slightly different.


365
0:22:4,4 --> 0:22:7,8
My memory is that
I was walking along the floor


366
0:22:7,8 --> 0:22:10,56
and I saw this creature
walking across...  Yes.


367
0:22:10,56 --> 0:22:12,36
..and I thought it was a lizard.


368
0:22:12,36 --> 0:22:13,4
Really?


369
0:22:13,4 --> 0:22:14,92
Really?
And I didn't step on it,


370
0:22:14,92 --> 0:22:17,96
I put my foot in the way of it
to let it crawl over my foot.


371
0:22:17,96 --> 0:22:20,36
Well...you jumped off your chair...


372
0:22:20,36 --> 0:22:22,92
Mmm. I don't remember the pain.


373
0:22:22,92 --> 0:22:28,64
Don't you? Isn't that interesting?
Cos that was the terrible bit.


374
0:22:28,64 --> 0:22:32,68
We think back to our first memory,
our first big adventure,


375
0:22:32,68 --> 0:22:36,0
and it's almost as though there
was a movie camera in our head


376
0:22:36,0 --> 0:22:37,88
recording every detail.


377
0:22:37,88 --> 0:22:40,6
But that's not the way it is.
That's an illusion.


378
0:22:40,6 --> 0:22:44,8
What we're remembering is a memory
of a memory of a memory,


379
0:22:44,8 --> 0:22:47,4
of perhaps the real thing.


380
0:22:47,4 --> 0:22:49,92
A man may wear a wrist watch
when he's 20


381
0:22:49,92 --> 0:22:51,88
and the same watch when he's 50.


382
0:22:51,88 --> 0:22:55,36
It's the same watch
but it's not the same man inside.


383
0:22:55,36 --> 0:22:59,4
Every atom in his body has changed,
has turned over.


384
0:22:59,4 --> 0:23:2,48
I'm not the child I once was.


385
0:23:2,48 --> 0:23:9,68
The child I once was is dead.


386
0:23:9,68 --> 0:23:14,4
So the physical cells
that once made me are long gone


387
0:23:14,4 --> 0:23:19,48
and my memories are more tenuous
than I would wish.


388
0:23:19,48 --> 0:23:23,36
The connection between younger
and older Richard Dawkins


389
0:23:23,36 --> 0:23:27,56
isn't as strong
as I might like it to be.


390
0:23:27,56 --> 0:23:30,4
And I think this is why


391
0:23:30,4 --> 0:23:33,16
the religious idea
of something permanent,


392
0:23:33,16 --> 0:23:36,64
the soul, is so plausible.


393
0:23:36,64 --> 0:23:57,8
Now I want to explore the reality
of why we die.


394
0:23:57,8 --> 0:24:2,12
Religion still dominates
our thinking about death.


395
0:24:2,12 --> 0:24:6,68
If we get rid of God, what's left?


396
0:24:6,68 --> 0:24:9,72
I'm on a voyage to tell you
the extraordinary truth


397
0:24:9,72 --> 0:24:19,12
that science reveals about death.


398
0:24:19,12 --> 0:24:20,96
According to evolutionary science,


399
0:24:20,96 --> 0:24:23,88
death is not something
to be overcome at all.


400
0:24:23,88 --> 0:24:30,4
It's a necessary part
of the picture.


401
0:24:30,4 --> 0:24:32,32
'I'm joining the scientists on board


402
0:24:32,32 --> 0:24:36,16
'Bangor University's
research vessel on the Irish Sea.'


403
0:24:36,16 --> 0:24:37,0
Is that alive?


404
0:24:37,0 --> 0:24:37,68
Is that alive?
Yeah, yeah.


405
0:24:37,68 --> 0:24:39,4
Is that alive?
Yeah, yeah.
So where do you put that?


406
0:24:39,4 --> 0:24:42,16
'They are studying the lifespan
of a species of clam


407
0:24:42,16 --> 0:24:44,12
'called Arctica Islandica.


408
0:24:44,12 --> 0:24:46,32
'They may look rather ordinary


409
0:24:46,32 --> 0:24:50,72
'but they have one attribute
that is really quite amazing.


410
0:24:50,72 --> 0:24:59,52
'These clams are among the
longest-living animals on Earth.'


411
0:24:59,52 --> 0:25:3,4
Save that one or not?


412
0:25:3,4 --> 0:25:5,44
The reason why we are
so interested in this


413
0:25:5,44 --> 0:25:7,4
is that this is a very
long-lived species.


414
0:25:7,4 --> 0:25:9,8
We can pull it up from the wild


415
0:25:9,8 --> 0:25:13,48
and assign a year - almost to
within one year - how old it is.


416
0:25:13,48 --> 0:25:16,6
Basically, the shell grows
in incremental steps.


417
0:25:16,6 --> 0:25:21,12
Each ring is an annual ring, so
the growth is very much like a tree.


418
0:25:21,12 --> 0:25:23,4
Can you guess from this one
how old is it?


419
0:25:23,4 --> 0:25:28,0
There's a size growth curve. This
is probably 80 to 150 years old.


420
0:25:28,0 --> 0:25:30,12
The oldest of them
reach what sort of age?


421
0:25:30,12 --> 0:25:34,56
Around the UK,
it's around about 220 years.


422
0:25:34,56 --> 0:25:36,4
Up in Iceland, in the far north,


423
0:25:36,4 --> 0:25:46,84
they'll hit 350, 400,
maybe even 500 years.


424
0:25:46,84 --> 0:25:50,48
Only recently, this research team
found a clam that had lived


425
0:25:50,48 --> 0:25:56,16
for more than half a millennium.


426
0:25:56,16 --> 0:25:59,28
It's amazing to think that some of
these clams that we're dredging up


427
0:25:59,28 --> 0:26:1,92
were born before Darwin,


428
0:26:1,92 --> 0:26:5,88
even before Elizabeth I.


429
0:26:5,88 --> 0:26:10,28
So, why do they live so long?


430
0:26:10,28 --> 0:26:13,6
Any evolutionary explanation
of why aging happens


431
0:26:13,6 --> 0:26:17,68
has to do two things.
It has to be able to explain


432
0:26:17,68 --> 0:26:23,4
why you see aging in many species.
It also has to be able to explain


433
0:26:23,4 --> 0:26:25,92
why you see
enormously long lifespans


434
0:26:25,92 --> 0:26:29,92
or possibly no aging
in a very few species.


435
0:26:29,92 --> 0:26:32,84
And the clams, I think,
may be an example of this.


436
0:26:32,84 --> 0:26:35,16
You've seen them and
handled them for yourself.


437
0:26:35,16 --> 0:26:37,2
They have enormously thick shells.


438
0:26:37,2 --> 0:26:40,0
I don't think there are
very many things down there


439
0:26:40,0 --> 0:26:42,64
that can actually bite through them.


440
0:26:42,64 --> 0:26:45,72
And so they can sit around


441
0:26:45,72 --> 0:26:48,96
and they can just carry on
producing offspring


442
0:26:48,96 --> 0:26:53,64
once they've reached
a certain size.


443
0:26:53,64 --> 0:26:56,8
'These clams are continuing to
pass on their genes to


444
0:26:56,8 --> 0:27:3,0
'the next generation,
even at 200 and 300 years old.'


445
0:27:3,0 --> 0:27:5,92
So, from the evolutionary point
of view, it is not just that


446
0:27:5,92 --> 0:27:9,56
the individuals are well protected
against being eaten.


447
0:27:9,56 --> 0:27:12,84
Because  they're
well-protected against being eaten,


448
0:27:12,84 --> 0:27:16,4
it's a good gamble
to stay alive a long time,


449
0:27:16,4 --> 0:27:19,24
because you've got
a good chance of reproducing later.


450
0:27:19,24 --> 0:27:21,36
Whereas something like a salmon


451
0:27:21,36 --> 0:27:24,88
has a very poor chance
of reproducing again,


452
0:27:24,88 --> 0:27:29,24
so it might as well throw everything
it's got into one big gamble now.


453
0:27:29,24 --> 0:27:31,24
That's exactly it.


454
0:27:31,24 --> 0:27:33,8
There is no point
in spending resources


455
0:27:33,8 --> 0:27:36,56
to make a body that
will last 400 years


456
0:27:36,56 --> 0:27:48,12
if your chance of making it
through the night is pretty slim.


457
0:27:48,12 --> 0:27:55,4
So, evolutionary science tells us
a lot about ageing and death.


458
0:27:55,4 --> 0:27:58,84
The clams are able to reproduce
when they are hundreds of years old,


459
0:27:58,84 --> 0:28:1,68
and so long as they are
able to reproduce,


460
0:28:1,68 --> 0:28:5,96
their genes keep them alive.


461
0:28:5,96 --> 0:28:13,8
We need to see death from
a gene's eye point of view.


462
0:28:13,8 --> 0:28:17,16
Our bodies are survival
machines for genes.


463
0:28:17,16 --> 0:28:19,52
Once our genes have got us
to reproductive age


464
0:28:19,52 --> 0:28:22,64
and copied themselves into
a new generation,


465
0:28:22,64 --> 0:28:25,8
our bodies have less purpose.


466
0:28:25,8 --> 0:28:27,96
Time bombs inside us go off.


467
0:28:27,96 --> 0:28:33,76
We age. We die.


468
0:28:33,76 --> 0:28:37,96
So, rather than looking upon
ageing as a wearing out of the body,


469
0:28:37,96 --> 0:28:46,88
perhaps we should see it as a
side effect of how our genes work.


470
0:28:46,88 --> 0:28:54,68
Even extraordinary exceptions
throw light on this truth.


471
0:28:54,68 --> 0:28:57,4
This is Irving Kahn,


472
0:28:57,4 --> 0:29:0,28
a financial trader
on New York's Madison Avenue,


473
0:29:0,28 --> 0:29:6,8
who has come to work
every day since 1927.


474
0:29:6,8 --> 0:29:9,72
Irving is 105 years old.


475
0:29:9,72 --> 0:29:12,28
Do you remember
the Wall Street crash?


476
0:29:12,28 --> 0:29:15,2
Oh, yes.
I came just at the time.


477
0:29:15,2 --> 0:29:24,4
About three or four months before
the peak, the summer of 1928, '29.


478
0:29:24,4 --> 0:29:27,4
And that was one reason
I didn't like the business.


479
0:29:27,4 --> 0:29:28,4
And that was one reason
I didn't like the business.
&lt; Yes.


480
0:29:28,4 --> 0:29:33,12
Because I came here,
went to the exchange on Wall Street,


481
0:29:33,12 --> 0:29:38,28
and found, after a week on the floor,
that it was like working in a casino.


482
0:29:38,28 --> 0:29:39,0
&lt; I can imagine.


483
0:29:39,0 --> 0:29:40,4
&lt; I can imagine.
A gambling house.


484
0:29:40,4 --> 0:29:42,6
I understand that, not just you


485
0:29:42,6 --> 0:29:46,24
but many members of your family
are extremely long-lived.


486
0:29:46,24 --> 0:29:50,0
Yes, my brother Peter is about
103 or 104.


487
0:29:50,0 --> 0:29:51,68
I'm 105.


488
0:29:51,68 --> 0:29:56,8
I have limited renals
and limited hearsight -


489
0:29:56,8 --> 0:30:1,12
and I hope, the right
number of marbles.


490
0:30:1,12 --> 0:30:2,92
You have got a lot of marbles,
I think!


491
0:30:2,92 --> 0:30:4,84
What about your sister,
how old is she?


492
0:30:4,84 --> 0:30:7,2
What about your sister,
how old is she?
She's 108.


493
0:30:7,2 --> 0:30:9,6
Mr Kahn, is it possible to
give us an idea


494
0:30:9,6 --> 0:30:12,48
what it feels like to be your age?


495
0:30:12,48 --> 0:30:20,96
It's much better
and it's much worse.


496
0:30:20,96 --> 0:30:24,36
So, why do some people's genes
keep their bodies going


497
0:30:24,36 --> 0:30:27,96
for so much longer?


498
0:30:27,96 --> 0:30:31,16
The curious case of Irving Kahn
and his family


499
0:30:31,16 --> 0:30:37,52
has intrigued scientists who are
trying to answer this very question.


500
0:30:37,52 --> 0:30:41,96
When we ask our people, why do
you think you live to be so old?


501
0:30:41,96 --> 0:30:44,96
One of the things they're saying,


502
0:30:44,96 --> 0:30:49,0
"Hey, it's in my family. My mother
was 102, my grandfather was 108."


503
0:30:49,0 --> 0:30:59,8
Irving can show that he has four
other siblings that lived to be 100.


504
0:30:59,8 --> 0:31:3,92
The study looked at
500 aged Ashkenazi Jews,


505
0:31:3,92 --> 0:31:7,36
like Irving Kahn,
from the same geographical area,


506
0:31:7,36 --> 0:31:14,2
whose environment and genes
can be easily compared.


507
0:31:14,2 --> 0:31:18,4
For Irving, and especially
for his sister, Helen,


508
0:31:18,4 --> 0:31:21,2
she's been smoking for 95 years,


509
0:31:21,2 --> 0:31:23,96
two packs for 95 years,


510
0:31:23,96 --> 0:31:27,8
which shows you that if you smoke
for 95 years, you live a long life!


511
0:31:27,8 --> 0:31:29,24
I know it doesn't!


512
0:31:29,24 --> 0:31:31,0
I know it doesn't!
I can assure you that that's true.


513
0:31:31,0 --> 0:31:35,44
And Irving has smoked
for about 30 years in his life.


514
0:31:35,44 --> 0:31:40,4
So the point here is that
our centenarians, as a group,


515
0:31:40,4 --> 0:31:42,8
did not interact
with their environment


516
0:31:42,8 --> 0:31:47,0
the way the doctors
tell their patients,


517
0:31:47,0 --> 0:31:50,4
that you have to watch your weight,
you have to exercise,


518
0:31:50,4 --> 0:31:52,4
you shouldn't smoke


519
0:31:52,4 --> 0:31:55,24
and you should drink
one cup of alcohol a day


520
0:31:55,24 --> 0:32:0,16
and all the things we know to tell
them. It doesn't matter for them.


521
0:32:0,16 --> 0:32:3,32
So, for some,
lifestyle and environment


522
0:32:3,32 --> 0:32:7,36
don't play as large a role
as we've been told.


523
0:32:7,36 --> 0:32:11,52
But if Irving's genes hold
the secret to long life,


524
0:32:11,52 --> 0:32:16,32
why hasn't evolution given us
all genes like his?


525
0:32:16,32 --> 0:32:20,8
If there are genes that increase
longevity out into the hundreds,


526
0:32:20,8 --> 0:32:25,56
why didn't natural selection favour
those genes in our ancestral past?


527
0:32:25,56 --> 0:32:29,36
Well, I will tell you,
there is something very upsetting


528
0:32:29,36 --> 0:32:32,56
in this sense in our group.
First of all,


529
0:32:32,56 --> 0:32:35,92
a third of the centenarians
in the world don't have children.


530
0:32:35,92 --> 0:32:39,64
OK, so I don't know, is it
having children, raising them,


531
0:32:39,64 --> 0:32:41,64
rearing them, I don't know what?


532
0:32:41,64 --> 0:32:43,4
But the point is that there is


533
0:32:43,4 --> 0:32:46,4
some exchange between
reproduction and aging.


534
0:32:46,4 --> 0:32:50,8
But also, in my study,
the centenarians had less kids


535
0:32:50,8 --> 0:32:54,6
at a much later age
than my control population.


536
0:32:54,6 --> 0:32:59,48
So, if the control population has
three to five kids on average,


537
0:32:59,48 --> 0:33:3,12
our centenarians
are 1.7 kids on average.


538
0:33:3,12 --> 0:33:6,8
And so, if you
are thinking that way,


539
0:33:6,8 --> 0:33:9,24
we're losing longevity genes, right?


540
0:33:9,24 --> 0:33:12,12
Because in every generation,
we populate more


541
0:33:12,12 --> 0:33:15,36
with kids of the people
who don't have longevity genes


542
0:33:15,36 --> 0:33:22,4
than have longevity genes.


543
0:33:22,4 --> 0:33:27,12
Our genes appear to trade
long life for reproduction.


544
0:33:27,12 --> 0:33:30,24
Longevity seems to be connected
to later reproduction


545
0:33:30,24 --> 0:33:34,8
or no children at all.


546
0:33:34,8 --> 0:33:38,48
So how long we live and why
we die are dependent on our genes.


547
0:33:38,48 --> 0:33:48,8
And I'm about to look my own
genetic code straight in the face.


548
0:33:48,8 --> 0:33:50,24
Advances in genetic science mean


549
0:33:50,24 --> 0:33:59,6
it is now possible for me
to get my entire genome decoded.


550
0:33:59,6 --> 0:34:2,6
There's something very personal
and intimate about it as well.


551
0:34:2,6 --> 0:34:5,16
This is something that is
absolutely unique to me,


552
0:34:5,16 --> 0:34:8,52
there's never ever been,
in the history of the world,


553
0:34:8,52 --> 0:34:10,4
nor will there be again


554
0:34:10,4 --> 0:34:12,56
a genome which is the same as mine,


555
0:34:12,56 --> 0:34:23,8
or the same as yours,
or the same as anybody else's.


556
0:34:23,8 --> 0:34:26,8
This new science
is still in its infancy.


557
0:34:26,8 --> 0:34:29,56
I'm going to be one of just
a dozen people in the world


558
0:34:29,56 --> 0:34:31,8
and the first person in Britain


559
0:34:31,8 --> 0:34:40,64
publicly to have
their whole genome sequenced.


560
0:34:40,64 --> 0:34:42,92
What we're doing here
is very new for us, actually,


561
0:34:42,92 --> 0:34:45,32
and it's actually
very exciting for us.


562
0:34:45,32 --> 0:34:49,28
We're taking a genome of
a healthy person and we are asking,


563
0:34:49,28 --> 0:34:51,68
what can we learn about that person?


564
0:34:51,68 --> 0:34:54,76
It is your most important bit
of information about you,


565
0:34:54,76 --> 0:34:56,24
is your genome sequence.


566
0:34:56,24 --> 0:34:59,52
But on a serious note,
of course, we may find information


567
0:34:59,52 --> 0:35:4,16
in your genome that has clinical
or health implications.


568
0:35:4,16 --> 0:35:5,92
Yes, I have thought about that.


569
0:35:5,92 --> 0:35:7,68
So, let's go, let's go and do it.


570
0:35:7,68 --> 0:35:9,72
OK.


571
0:35:9,72 --> 0:35:13,0
It'll just be a little scratch
as the needle goes in.


572
0:35:13,0 --> 0:35:17,4
'Having my blood taken is only the
first stage in a complex process.'


573
0:35:17,4 --> 0:35:18,56
OK, so we're almost there.


574
0:35:18,56 --> 0:35:22,68
This is the most painless
blood test I've ever had.


575
0:35:22,68 --> 0:35:26,2
'Having my genome decoded
is, in effect, a way


576
0:35:26,2 --> 0:35:30,52
'of narrowing down how and when
I'm going to die.


577
0:35:30,52 --> 0:35:34,68
'My journey to understand death
has become personal.'


578
0:35:34,68 --> 0:35:37,4
You have roughly 100 mutations


579
0:35:37,4 --> 0:35:53,52
which have been reported as being
associated with a disease.


580
0:35:53,52 --> 0:35:56,56
'I may be one of a handful
of individuals in the world


581
0:35:56,56 --> 0:36:1,24
'to have their genome sequenced,
but before I find out my results


582
0:36:1,24 --> 0:36:5,24
'I'm off to meet the man
who was first.


583
0:36:5,24 --> 0:36:7,84
'And he isn't just anyone.


584
0:36:7,84 --> 0:36:11,92
'He's one of the two men who made
this new science possible -


585
0:36:11,92 --> 0:36:14,12
'James Watson.'


586
0:36:14,12 --> 0:36:16,92
Well, it's certainly
a very beautiful thing.


587
0:36:16,92 --> 0:36:18,84
'Together with Francis Crick,


588
0:36:18,84 --> 0:36:22,48
'James Watson discovered that genes
are digital codes


589
0:36:22,48 --> 0:36:25,76
'written on DNA molecules.


590
0:36:25,76 --> 0:36:29,36
'Watson and Crick's names
will live forever.


591
0:36:29,36 --> 0:36:34,8
'And Watson isn't shy about it.'


592
0:36:34,8 --> 0:36:38,4
So now I realise, I am,
except for Hawking,


593
0:36:38,4 --> 0:36:40,24
the most famous scientist alive.


594
0:36:40,24 --> 0:36:43,44
Oh, wonderful, yes.


595
0:36:43,44 --> 0:36:46,92
I turned out to be helped by people
looking at my DNA.


596
0:36:46,92 --> 0:36:48,16
In what way?


597
0:36:48,16 --> 0:36:54,36
It revealed that I have a genetic
polymorphism which metabolises drugs


598
0:36:54,36 --> 0:36:56,84
and I have one which acts
very slowly.


599
0:36:56,84 --> 0:37:0,8
So if I take, er, beta blockers,


600
0:37:0,8 --> 0:37:5,44
it stays in my system for a week
instead of going away for a day.


601
0:37:5,44 --> 0:37:8,84
So I've been given them for,
you know,


602
0:37:8,84 --> 0:37:15,68
to help control my blood pressure
and I went to sleep!


603
0:37:15,68 --> 0:37:19,92
Watson took a personal risk
in making his genome available


604
0:37:19,92 --> 0:37:24,52
for study, exposing all its
imperfections to public scrutiny


605
0:37:24,52 --> 0:37:28,88
for the sake
of advancing genetic research.


606
0:37:28,88 --> 0:37:31,36
Do you get great pleasure
from ideas?


607
0:37:31,36 --> 0:37:34,4
No, I get pleasure
from understanding.


608
0:37:34,4 --> 0:37:38,0
Yes. So understanding,
everything falls into place
when you understand?


609
0:37:38,0 --> 0:37:43,28
Yes, you move from...
It's understanding, er...


610
0:37:43,28 --> 0:37:49,56
that gives you happiness and I think
it's one of the unique human features


611
0:37:49,56 --> 0:37:54,28
because it's not limited to me
but it clearly,


612
0:37:54,28 --> 0:38:3,92
you know, when you're able to
find out how to do something.


613
0:38:3,92 --> 0:38:7,12
This, for me, is what is
so thrilling about science -


614
0:38:7,12 --> 0:38:10,92
understanding things,
such as how the DNA molecule


615
0:38:10,92 --> 0:38:16,12
underlies all life on Earth.


616
0:38:16,12 --> 0:38:19,2
It's because Watson discovered
the structure of DNA,


617
0:38:19,2 --> 0:38:24,68
over half a century ago, that today
I'm able to have my genome analysed


618
0:38:24,68 --> 0:38:33,28
and understand what makes me live,
and how and when I might die.


619
0:38:33,28 --> 0:38:36,8
Today is a very special day for me.


620
0:38:36,8 --> 0:38:39,4
In 50 years, lots of people
will be able to say this,


621
0:38:39,4 --> 0:38:42,8
but today I'm one of very few people


622
0:38:42,8 --> 0:38:44,76
who's had
their entire genome sequenced.


623
0:38:44,76 --> 0:38:50,96
Today is the big day
when I get to see the results.


624
0:38:50,96 --> 0:38:53,64
So Richard, it's a long time
since you were in Oxford


625
0:38:53,64 --> 0:38:56,8
and we took an armful of your blood.


626
0:38:56,8 --> 0:38:58,16
We've had a team
busy working since then,


627
0:38:58,16 --> 0:39:1,2
trying to extract the DNA
and reconstruct your genome.


628
0:39:1,2 --> 0:39:2,68
We take these fragments...


629
0:39:2,68 --> 0:39:4,48
'To understand my genes,


630
0:39:4,48 --> 0:39:8,36
'Gil McVean matches them against
the human reference genome -


631
0:39:8,36 --> 0:39:11,32
'a composite of anonymous donors


632
0:39:11,32 --> 0:39:14,52
'that took ten years to decode
and construct.'


633
0:39:14,52 --> 0:39:16,32
What we're really interested in


634
0:39:16,32 --> 0:39:19,12
is not saying where you agree
with this reference


635
0:39:19,12 --> 0:39:21,0
but finding places where you differ.


636
0:39:21,0 --> 0:39:24,24
In that,
we find over four million differences


637
0:39:24,24 --> 0:39:26,4
between your genome
and that reference.


638
0:39:26,4 --> 0:39:29,24
We have about 50,000 variants
that we have seen in you


639
0:39:29,24 --> 0:39:32,84
for the very first time,
completely new to science.


640
0:39:32,84 --> 0:39:36,48
'It is extraordinary that this
enormous quantity of data


641
0:39:36,48 --> 0:39:40,12
'reveals incredibly precise details
about me.


642
0:39:40,12 --> 0:39:42,52
'Elements of my private world


643
0:39:42,52 --> 0:39:46,24
'that I've never shared with anyone
before, or known myself.'


644
0:39:46,24 --> 0:39:48,52
You have a classic European mutation


645
0:39:48,52 --> 0:39:50,8
that means that you've got
runny earwax.


646
0:39:50,8 --> 0:39:54,92
Another one which means that you can
smell asparagus in your own urine.


647
0:39:54,92 --> 0:39:58,24
You've got another one that
means you can taste broccoli.


648
0:39:58,24 --> 0:40:0,8
They sound frivolous,


649
0:40:0,8 --> 0:40:3,56
but at the same time they probably
point to an evolutionary process


650
0:40:3,56 --> 0:40:8,64
and that's probably to do with
your ability to detect toxins.


651
0:40:8,64 --> 0:40:11,8
Plants have different toxins
across the world.


652
0:40:11,8 --> 0:40:14,0
There are local adaptations to toxins


653
0:40:14,0 --> 0:40:18,56
that you need to be able to recognise
to survive.


654
0:40:18,56 --> 0:40:21,92
'Buried in my genome
is the story of my own survival,


655
0:40:21,92 --> 0:40:25,88
'but also clues about how I may die.


656
0:40:25,88 --> 0:40:31,16
'Do I have ticking time bombs
in my genetic code?'


657
0:40:31,16 --> 0:40:33,4
You have roughly a hundred mutations


658
0:40:33,4 --> 0:40:36,88
which have been seen before
in clinical settings


659
0:40:36,88 --> 0:40:40,6
and have been reported
as being associated with a disease.


660
0:40:40,6 --> 0:40:45,8
Having these mutations doesn't mean
you'll definitely get the disease,


661
0:40:45,8 --> 0:40:47,0
it just alters your chance
of getting that.


662
0:40:47,0 --> 0:40:49,44
These are the variants
that you carry


663
0:40:49,44 --> 0:40:54,56
which have been associated with a
whole range of common disorders.


664
0:40:54,56 --> 0:40:57,4
Everything from cancer
through to type II diabetes


665
0:40:57,4 --> 0:40:59,32
through to schizophrenia.


666
0:40:59,32 --> 0:41:1,88
Let's just take an example of this.


667
0:41:1,88 --> 0:41:5,8
If you zoom in on chromosome 11,
you've got a mutation


668
0:41:5,8 --> 0:41:9,68
which the literature tells you is
associated with, or causes porphyria,


669
0:41:9,68 --> 0:41:13,48
which is the disease that people
hypothesised for a while


670
0:41:13,48 --> 0:41:15,8
caused the madness of King George.


671
0:41:15,8 --> 0:41:17,92
It's a nasty disease.
You would know if you had it.


672
0:41:17,92 --> 0:41:22,52
You should have
a 70% chance of getting porphyria.


673
0:41:22,52 --> 0:41:26,72
'So I've dodged that bullet,
but there are other threats.


674
0:41:26,72 --> 0:41:29,76
'It's so impressively precise!


675
0:41:29,76 --> 0:41:31,96
'My genome reveals that if I smoked,


676
0:41:31,96 --> 0:41:34,64
'I would have been
in the most high-risk group


677
0:41:34,64 --> 0:41:37,64
'for developing lung cancer.'


678
0:41:37,64 --> 0:41:41,12
Your genotype doubles your risk
of getting lung cancer


679
0:41:41,12 --> 0:41:43,2
but actually the way it does it


680
0:41:43,2 --> 0:41:46,76
is through doubling your risk
of smoking in a particular way.


681
0:41:46,76 --> 0:41:50,64
So this variant influences your risk
of getting lung cancer


682
0:41:50,64 --> 0:41:52,84
because it changes the way
people smoke.


683
0:41:52,84 --> 0:41:54,6
They smoke deeper breaths,


684
0:41:54,6 --> 0:41:56,72
they smoke closer
to the end of the cigarette.


685
0:41:56,72 --> 0:42:0,48
What it actually does
is change your smoking habits.


686
0:42:0,48 --> 0:42:5,8
How fascinating! So it's picked
up as a gene for lung cancer


687
0:42:5,8 --> 0:42:8,32
but the method of transmission,


688
0:42:8,32 --> 0:42:11,96
the method of effect
is via smoking behaviour.


689
0:42:11,96 --> 0:42:14,92
Exactly. This raises the question
of whether you've ever smoked.


690
0:42:14,92 --> 0:42:16,28
Do you like the smell of wood smoke?


691
0:42:16,28 --> 0:42:17,48
Do you like the smell of wood smoke?
No, I've never smoked.


692
0:42:17,48 --> 0:42:20,76
That's good, but don't take up
smoking is my advice.


693
0:42:20,76 --> 0:42:23,72
It seems to me
to be utterly astonishing


694
0:42:23,72 --> 0:42:28,4
that it's possible for scientists
to take an individual


695
0:42:28,4 --> 0:42:35,32
and to detect these millions
of digital pieces of information


696
0:42:35,32 --> 0:42:39,64
to actually read it out
as though it was a computer disk.


697
0:42:39,64 --> 0:42:43,76
Well, here it is then. Here is
your genome. Look after it!


698
0:42:43,76 --> 0:42:47,8
Thank you very much!
I'm delighted to have it.


699
0:42:47,8 --> 0:42:51,88
Thank you so much for all the work
you and your colleagues have put in.


700
0:42:51,88 --> 0:42:54,52
I mean, when I look at this,
this little box here,


701
0:42:54,52 --> 0:42:59,8
what it contains is all the
information necessary to make...


702
0:42:59,8 --> 0:43:3,0
not quite me,
to make an identical twin of me.


703
0:43:3,0 --> 0:43:6,4
And I think that's an astonishing
thought.


704
0:43:6,4 --> 0:43:8,84
Thank you very, very much for this.


705
0:43:8,84 --> 0:43:19,76
It's been a pleasure.


706
0:43:19,76 --> 0:43:21,96
As we come to learn more about DNA,


707
0:43:21,96 --> 0:43:28,88
our relationship with death
is bound to change.


708
0:43:28,88 --> 0:43:31,96
And as more of us
have our genomes analysed,


709
0:43:31,96 --> 0:43:36,28
will we be able to avoid
those ticking time bombs
contained in our codes


710
0:43:36,28 --> 0:43:49,2
that killed our ancestors
after they reproduced?


711
0:43:49,2 --> 0:43:52,64
This is my genome, my whole genome.


712
0:43:52,64 --> 0:43:57,4
And strangely enough, portions
of my genome are behind that door.


713
0:43:57,4 --> 0:44:0,84
Behind there
is the Dawkins' family vault.


714
0:44:0,84 --> 0:44:5,8
This has been the Dawkins' church
since the 1720s


715
0:44:5,8 --> 0:44:10,88
and in there are 20 of my relations,
many of them my ancestors,


716
0:44:10,88 --> 0:44:13,24
and they have contributed
some of the genes


717
0:44:13,24 --> 0:44:17,24
that are inside
this little silver box.


718
0:44:17,24 --> 0:44:20,76
At the top,
next to the top there,


719
0:44:20,76 --> 0:44:26,52
Henry Dawkins, and then three down,
his wife, Lady Juliana Dawkins.


720
0:44:26,52 --> 0:44:31,4
They are my four greats - my great,
great, great, great grandparents.


721
0:44:31,4 --> 0:44:37,2
One-64th of the genes
inside this little silver box
come from Henry.


722
0:44:37,2 --> 0:44:40,2
The bottom of this column here,
the middle column, is another Henry,


723
0:44:40,2 --> 0:44:45,12
his son -
he has contributed one-32nd part


724
0:44:45,12 --> 0:44:48,4
of the genes inside this hard disk.


725
0:44:48,4 --> 0:44:51,52
Unfortunately,
the door can't be opened.


726
0:44:51,52 --> 0:44:54,4
It hasn't been opened since,
I think, 1919.


727
0:44:54,4 --> 0:44:56,88
They've lost the key,
nobody knows how to open it.


728
0:44:56,88 --> 0:45:0,32
There are some slots in there
that I should never occupy


729
0:45:0,32 --> 0:45:3,72
unless they can get the door open!
What would be rather nice


730
0:45:3,72 --> 0:45:7,44
would be if we could somehow post
this disk in there


731
0:45:7,44 --> 0:45:11,6
to rest alongside my ancestors.


732
0:45:11,6 --> 0:45:17,4
But the genes, the set of
instructions inside us, don't rest.


733
0:45:17,4 --> 0:45:20,44
Just as they have come
from our ancestors before us,


734
0:45:20,44 --> 0:45:23,24
so too do they march on
into our children


735
0:45:23,24 --> 0:45:28,28
and their children's children.


736
0:45:28,28 --> 0:45:33,12
Our genes are a kind of archive
of the remote past.


737
0:45:33,12 --> 0:45:37,4
They go through us
to the remote future.


738
0:45:37,4 --> 0:45:40,56
Henry Dawkins may be
my four greats grandfather


739
0:45:40,56 --> 0:45:42,56
and he's put some genes in here,


740
0:45:42,56 --> 0:45:46,28
but my two hundred million
greats grandfather was a fish


741
0:45:46,28 --> 0:45:47,76
and, by the way,


742
0:45:47,76 --> 0:45:51,44
the same fish was your two hundred
million greats grandfather too.


743
0:45:51,44 --> 0:45:56,12
Amazingly, even he
has put some genes in here,


744
0:45:56,12 --> 0:46:1,32
and they, too, have a chance
of going on to the remote future.


745
0:46:1,32 --> 0:46:4,44
Our genes are, in a sense, immortal.


746
0:46:4,44 --> 0:46:8,4
That's not comforting in the way
the soul is supposed to be,


747
0:46:8,4 --> 0:46:13,6
but it is a wonderful thought
and it is true.


748
0:46:13,6 --> 0:46:17,96
We may argue about whether
we have an immortal soul


749
0:46:17,96 --> 0:46:22,12
that survives our death, but one
thing science tells us for sure
