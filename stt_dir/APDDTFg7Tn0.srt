BEN LASHES: Brad O'Farrell
kind of


4
0:0:24,69 --> 0:0:25,88
started this whole thing.


5
0:0:25,88 --> 0:0:27,66
BRAD O'FARRELL: Oh
yeah, I guess.


6
0:0:27,66 --> 0:0:31,14
BEN LASHES: The internet,
he started the internet.


7
0:0:31,14 --> 0:0:33,22
BRAD O'FARRELL: My name is Brad
O'Farrell, and I posted


8
0:0:33,22 --> 0:0:36,66
the first Keyboard Cat video
and started the meme of


9
0:0:36,66 --> 0:0:39,69
mashing up Keyboard Cat to fail
videos so he's playing


10
0:0:39,69 --> 0:0:40,94
people off.


11
0:0:40,94 --> 0:0:47,7



12
0:0:47,7 --> 0:0:51,9
So the actual video of the cat
was filmed in 1985, I think.


13
0:0:51,9 --> 0:0:53,78
And I was born in 1986, so
I didn't film the video.


14
0:0:53,78 --> 0:0:57,23
The original video was made by
a guy named Charlie Schmidt.


15
0:0:57,23 --> 0:1:1,41
And he's an artist who does
lots of different mediums.


16
0:1:1,41 --> 0:1:3,8
He's kind of like
an old hippie.


17
0:1:3,8 --> 0:1:5,57
It sounds mean that I said that,
but that's very much


18
0:1:5,57 --> 0:1:6,18
what he is.


19
0:1:6,18 --> 0:1:8,1
CHARLIE SCHMIDT: You're not
getting anything done on this


20
0:1:8,1 --> 0:1:8,96
spray paint thing.


21
0:1:8,96 --> 0:1:10,8
Look at this mess.


22
0:1:10,8 --> 0:1:12,365
If you want to see weird,
just be it.


23
0:1:12,365 --> 0:1:14,39
BRAD O'FARRELL: Completely
unrelated to Keyboard Cat, he


24
0:1:14,39 --> 0:1:16,81
has a nose that he can move
like an elephant.


25
0:1:16,81 --> 0:1:20,23
He can move it in directions,
and he used to be in Japanese


26
0:1:20,23 --> 0:1:21,81
commercials and stuff.


27
0:1:21,81 --> 0:1:24,21
And he has an agent
for his nose.


28
0:1:24,21 --> 0:1:26,58
And that was his job
at some point.


29
0:1:26,58 --> 0:1:29,65
I can't remember exactly
how I came across it.


30
0:1:29,65 --> 0:1:32,34
I was looking at a lot of
videos at the time.


31
0:1:32,34 --> 0:1:34,8
Every day, my job was
to look at videos.


32
0:1:34,8 --> 0:1:36,55
So somebody sent it to me,
but I can't remember


33
0:1:36,55 --> 0:1:37,75
who sent it to me.


34
0:1:37,75 --> 0:1:43,15
The first video that I made was
just a fail video of a guy


35
0:1:43,15 --> 0:1:46,232
trying to go up an escalator on
a wheelchair, and then he


36
0:1:46,232 --> 0:1:46,64
tumbles backwards.


37
0:1:46,64 --> 0:1:47,89
And then Keyboard Cat
plays him off.


38
0:1:47,89 --> 0:1:57,49



39
0:1:57,49 --> 0:1:58,954
-You OK, man?


40
0:1:58,954 --> 0:1:59,95
-Yeah.


41
0:1:59,95 --> 0:2:2,53
BEN LASHES: So that's when all
of a sudden this video that no


42
0:2:2,53 --> 0:2:6,12
one had cared about started
exploding, going viral, and


43
0:2:6,12 --> 0:2:8,9
turning his life upside
down a little bit.


44
0:2:8,9 --> 0:2:8,919
BRAD O'FARRELL: And I was
originally going to do a


45
0:2:8,919 --> 0:2:12,84
series of them, so I sort of
made it into a template of--


46
0:2:12,84 --> 0:2:15,25
I can easily repeat this
template later, like a


47
0:2:15,25 --> 0:2:17,5
knock-knock joke
type template.


48
0:2:17,5 --> 0:2:18,54
BEN LASHES: And why it
was smart and why it


49
0:2:18,54 --> 0:2:20,15
caught on so well was--


50
0:2:20,15 --> 0:2:23,494
so much about the internet
that's about shocking people


51
0:2:23,494 --> 0:2:24,78
as much as you can.


52
0:2:24,78 --> 0:2:27,28
BRAD O'FARRELL: Then I saw
people starting unprompted


53
0:2:27,28 --> 0:2:27,83
doing parodies.


54
0:2:27,83 --> 0:2:29,3
I was like, whoa.


55
0:2:29,3 --> 0:2:31,69
BEN LASHES: A lot of these
videos that it got put with,


56
0:2:31,69 --> 0:2:35,33
you almost don't know if
it's right to laugh.


57
0:2:35,33 --> 0:2:38,36
It could be the most awful thing
that you've ever seen,


58
0:2:38,36 --> 0:2:41,68
and if you put Keyboard
Cat at the end of it,


59
0:2:41,68 --> 0:2:44,38
then you can smile.


60
0:2:44,38 --> 0:2:46,8
BRAD O'FARRELL: When it was
happening, I was like, yeah.


61
0:2:46,8 --> 0:2:47,53
I was talking to people about
that all the time.


62
0:2:47,53 --> 0:2:51,7
Because something I did was on
MTV Movie Awards, and Bill


63
0:2:51,7 --> 0:2:53,67
O'Reilly said that Keyboard
Cat was a patriot.


64
0:2:53,67 --> 0:2:55,44
I just wanted to talk about
it, because it was an


65
0:2:55,44 --> 0:2:57,13
interesting thing that was
going on in my life.


66
0:2:57,13 --> 0:2:58,98
BEN LASHES: About a year and a
half into it, we'd already


67
0:2:58,98 --> 0:3:3,96
done a Wonderful Pistachios
commercial.


68
0:3:3,96 --> 0:3:6,57
-Keyboard Cat does
it purrrfectly.


69
0:3:6,57 --> 0:3:9,68
BEN LASHES: Movie trailer from
"Exit Through the Gift Shop,"


70
0:3:9,68 --> 0:3:12,563
but he did it with all cats and
he called it "Exit Through


71
0:3:12,563 --> 0:3:17,15
the Pet Shop." Still getting
some cool deals coming across


72
0:3:17,15 --> 0:3:20,49
that was making Keyboard
Cat a household name.


73
0:3:20,49 --> 0:3:21,662
BRAD O'FARRELL: Most of the
stuff that's popular on


74
0:3:21,662 --> 0:3:24,77
YouTube isn't bloggers trying
really hard to be popular.


75
0:3:24,77 --> 0:3:27,99
It's a baby biting
another baby.


76
0:3:27,99 --> 0:3:30,225
-Charlie, that really hurt.


77
0:3:30,225 --> 0:3:33,93



78
0:3:33,93 --> 0:3:34,87
Charlie bit me.


79
0:3:34,87 --> 0:3:36,53
BRAD O'FARRELL: You know, all
these people that do things on


80
0:3:36,53 --> 0:3:38,8
the internet, there's two
different categories.


81
0:3:38,8 --> 0:3:43,48
There's some people who ended
up doing internet stuff, and


82
0:3:43,48 --> 0:3:45,89
they don't know how they got
there, Like "David After the


83
0:3:45,89 --> 0:3:48,91
Dentist," where the little boy
was at the dentist, and then


84
0:3:48,91 --> 0:3:49,89
he was on drugs.


85
0:3:49,89 --> 0:3:52,61
And he's in the car, and he's
like, is this real life?


86
0:3:52,61 --> 0:3:54,64
-Stay in your seat.


87
0:3:54,64 --> 0:4:0,952
-[SCREAMING]


88
0:4:0,952 --> 0:4:3,654
I don't feel tired.

-You don't?


90
0:4:4,55 --> 0:4:5,45
-Uh uh.


91
0:4:5,45 --> 0:4:6,32
BRAD O'FARRELL: You ever
seen Tron Guy?


92
0:4:6,32 --> 0:4:11,42
He's this guy in a latex Tron
costume, but he's really old


93
0:4:11,42 --> 0:4:13,19
and fat and has a pot belly.


94
0:4:13,19 --> 0:4:15,8
TRON GUY: I will never
again be anonymous.


95
0:4:15,8 --> 0:4:17,0
And one of these days,
somebody's going to come up


96
0:4:17,0 --> 0:4:20,339
with a way to synthesize
3D images from


97
0:4:20,339 --> 0:4:21,54
pictures on the internet.


98
0:4:21,54 --> 0:4:24,41
And 3D models of me are going
to float around known space


99
0:4:24,41 --> 0:4:25,38
until there isn't any more.


100
0:4:25,38 --> 0:4:26,915

0:4:36,18 --> 0:4:41,3



105
0:4:41,3 --> 0:4:45,21
I've met him like eight times
and never on purpose.


106
0:4:45,21 --> 0:4:47,1
I'll be traveling to a place,
and he'll just happen to be


107
0:4:47,1 --> 0:4:48,87
also in that place, because
we both go to

an alternate set of high

just follow where everyone


112

keep in touch.

And he just looks
like a douche.

like, borrows your lighter and

never gives it back.
