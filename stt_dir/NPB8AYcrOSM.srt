0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,667
Hi, I'm Sharon Long,


2
0:0:1,667 --> 0:0:2,6
from Stanford University,


3
0:0:2,6 --> 0:0:5,667
and I'm here today to talk about our recent on the plant side


4
0:0:5,667 --> 0:0:8,667
of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, specifically about


5
0:0:8,667 --> 0:0:11,567
genes and cell responses.


6
0:0:11,567 --> 0:0:15,7
By way of review, I'll mention again that the Rhizobium symbiosis


7
0:0:15,7 --> 0:0:19,5
happens in organs called root nodules.


8
0:0:19,5 --> 0:0:23,767
And within these nodules, bacteria are able to fix nitrogen


9
0:0:23,767 --> 0:0:26,167
and provide that to the plant for nutrition.


10
0:0:26,167 --> 0:0:29,67
This is complex developmental process,


11
0:0:29,67 --> 0:0:30,567
it goes through a number of stages,


12
0:0:30,567 --> 0:0:32,233
and you'll see some of those today.


13
0:0:32,233 --> 0:0:36,367
It is species specific, which I've discussed in some of my earlier talks.


14
0:0:36,367 --> 0:0:39,667
And importantly, for today's lecture,


15
0:0:39,667 --> 0:0:44,1
bacterium and plant each respond to signals from the other.


16
0:0:44,1 --> 0:0:46,267
An outline of my talk today is shown here.


17
0:0:46,267 --> 0:0:48,4
At the beginning, I'll give you some introduction,


18
0:0:48,4 --> 0:0:52,4
reviewing some of the dynamics of how bacteria and plants interact.


19
0:0:52,4 --> 0:0:55,333
Then I'd like to talk about some recent work in our lab,


20
0:0:55,333 --> 0:1:0,133
first about infection and about of group of proteins called flotillins,


21
0:1:0,133 --> 0:1:4,0
and also about a Nod Factor receptor from the plant.


22
0:1:4,0 --> 0:1:8,267
Then I'd like to talk about two plant mutants, dnf1 and dnf2,


23
0:1:8,267 --> 0:1:13,633
which we've identified as being defective in late stages of nodulation.


24
0:1:13,633 --> 0:1:17,7
And by describing the genes that we've now cloned from those mutants,


25
0:1:17,7 --> 0:1:23,367
I can share with you some of our ideas on how the symbiosis is working.


26
0:1:23,367 --> 0:1:27,733
So, here I'm showing a review of the basic idea


27
0:1:27,733 --> 0:1:31,733
of signal exchange in the early phases of nodulation.


28
0:1:31,733 --> 0:1:35,1
The plant secretes a flavonoid signal,


29
0:1:35,1 --> 0:1:38,3
this flavonoid acts as a trigger in the bacterium,


30
0:1:38,3 --> 0:1:42,167
and that causes the transcription of genes called nod genes,


31
0:1:42,167 --> 0:1:45,167
which encode enzymes. Those enzymes are able to


32
0:1:45,167 --> 0:1:50,533
synthesize this second signal, the so-called Nod Factor, down here,


33
0:1:50,533 --> 0:1:53,967
sometimes abbreviated as NF in some of the slides to come.


34
0:1:53,967 --> 0:1:57,267
This is a modified chitin fragment,


35
0:1:57,267 --> 0:2:1,933
you can see there's four residues of N-acetylglucosamine.


36
0:2:1,933 --> 0:2:6,133
These are modified at the reducing end with a sulfate,


37
0:2:6,133 --> 0:2:11,367
and at the non-reducing end with both an acetyl and an N-acyl group.


38
0:2:11,367 --> 0:2:14,367
And in one of the slides yet to come,


39
0:2:14,367 --> 0:2:17,8
I'll be talking about the differences between the plant response


40
0:2:17,8 --> 0:2:21,167
to chitin to a true Nod Factor.


41
0:2:21,167 --> 0:2:23,4
So Nod Factors are very powerful,


42
0:2:23,4 --> 0:2:26,6
and this gives you an idea of just how powerful they are.


43
0:2:26,6 --> 0:2:30,467
On the top, we have an alfalfa root, and on this root,


44
0:2:30,467 --> 0:2:34,933
Sinorhizobium meliloti, the symbiont, has established a nodule,


45
0:2:34,933 --> 0:2:36,5
and this is an intact nodule.


46
0:2:36,5 --> 0:2:40,267
It's been cleared, and you can see the deep brown color,


47
0:2:40,267 --> 0:2:43,567
which is from the metals that are in the various cytochromes


48
0:2:43,567 --> 0:2:47,3
and enzymes of the bacteria while they're fixing nitrogen.


49
0:2:47,3 --> 0:2:51,33
Now at the bottom, we see a form that looks very similar,


50
0:2:51,33 --> 0:2:53,3
and yet this has no bacteria in it.


51
0:2:53,3 --> 0:2:55,9
This entire structure on an alfalfa root


52
0:2:55,9 --> 0:3:0,9
was caused just by a small droplet of Nod Factor.


53
0:3:0,9 --> 0:3:7,6
So this one chemical is able to produce an entire organ on the plant.


54
0:3:7,6 --> 0:3:10,633
Here is another one of the characteristic early events


55
0:3:10,633 --> 0:3:13,767
in Rhizobium-legume interactions.


56
0:3:13,767 --> 0:3:20,0
This shows root hairs on the root of a plant, and here on the right,


57
0:3:20,0 --> 0:3:22,233
you can see a normal root hair, which grows straight.


58
0:3:22,233 --> 0:3:25,733
And here you see a root hair that has been provoked


59
0:3:25,733 --> 0:3:30,367
by Rhizobium to grow in a such a way that it tops over


60
0:3:30,367 --> 0:3:35,367
and forms a curl. And here in the crook is where the


61
0:3:35,367 --> 0:3:40,6
bacteria are trapped, and these deformed root hairs


62
0:3:40,6 --> 0:3:44,167
of various kinds are very characteristic of the effect


63
0:3:44,167 --> 0:3:49,133
of the correct Rhizobium on its compatible host.


64
0:3:49,133 --> 0:3:55,433
Now, the bacteria are then able to travel by proliferating


65
0:3:55,433 --> 0:3:59,533
and burrowing their way into the plant cell itself.


66
0:3:59,533 --> 0:4:2,6
And this white arrow shows an infection thread;


67
0:4:2,6 --> 0:4:6,333
this is formed by the plant in response to the bacteria.


68
0:4:6,333 --> 0:4:9,7
Within the infection thread, bacteria are proliferating,


69
0:4:9,7 --> 0:4:13,67
and they are invading through the root hair cell,


70
0:4:13,67 --> 0:4:17,567
and as you'll see, eventually down into further cell layers.


71
0:4:17,567 --> 0:4:22,133
So there's the infection thread, and you'll see more about that in a little while.


72
0:4:22,133 --> 0:4:24,667
I'd now like to show you something about the dynamics


73
0:4:24,667 --> 0:4:27,267
of how Rhizobium affect plants.


74
0:4:27,267 --> 0:4:29,633
Let's start by looking at normal root hairs.


75
0:4:29,633 --> 0:4:32,967
So, on a root, the youngest part of the root is over here,


76
0:4:32,967 --> 0:4:35,4
and you can see that they don't have any root hairs yet,


77
0:4:35,4 --> 0:4:37,5
and then the root hairs get longer.


78
0:4:37,5 --> 0:4:40,67
And over here, they're full sized.


79
0:4:40,67 --> 0:4:43,767
So, root hairs get to a particular size, and then they stop.


80
0:4:43,767 --> 0:4:45,567
Now let's watch in this movie,


81
0:4:45,567 --> 0:4:50,367
to see how root hairs elongate normally, that's without Rhizobium.


82
0:4:50,367 --> 0:4:52,33
So here you see root hairs.


83
0:4:52,33 --> 0:4:55,167
They start, they grow, and then at some point


84
0:4:55,167 --> 0:4:58,8
they reach a mature length, and they just stop,


85
0:4:58,8 --> 0:5:2,9
but they grow fairly straight during this entire process.


86
0:5:2,9 --> 0:5:5,667
Now we're going to look at root hairs on a plant that


87
0:5:5,667 --> 0:5:9,7
has been treated with its Rhizobium symbiont.


88
0:5:9,7 --> 0:5:12,767
So here, the root hairs are in the process of growing,


89
0:5:12,767 --> 0:5:16,6
and if you watch what happens to them as they grow,


90
0:5:16,6 --> 0:5:22,833
you'll see how different it is from unperturbed growth.


91
0:5:22,833 --> 0:5:28,767
So here, for example, we see root hairs that are curling.


92
0:5:28,767 --> 0:5:33,0
Over on this side, if you look at this root hair, you can see that it's growing,


93
0:5:33,0 --> 0:5:35,567
and then it pauses, see that pause?


94
0:5:35,567 --> 0:5:39,6
And then it emerges, and now it pauses and branches again.


95
0:5:39,6 --> 0:5:41,367
So there's two things going on.


96
0:5:41,367 --> 0:5:46,33
One is this characteristic pause, so right here you can see


97
0:5:46,33 --> 0:5:49,167
there's a pause right before it starts to top over.


98
0:5:49,167 --> 0:5:53,1
And the other is that you're getting branching or curling,


99
0:5:53,1 --> 0:5:55,67
other kinds of deformation.


100
0:5:55,67 --> 0:5:58,2
So Rhizobium has a profound effect on the morphogenesis


101
0:5:58,2 --> 0:6:1,633
of this particular plant cell.


102
0:6:1,633 --> 0:6:5,0
Now, we've seen a little bit now about root hair deformation,


103
0:6:5,0 --> 0:6:9,3
and I'll mention along the way that Rhizobium can also


104
0:6:9,3 --> 0:6:13,0
cause roots to engage in specific transcription,


105
0:6:13,0 --> 0:6:14,733
which we study with microarrays,


106
0:6:14,733 --> 0:6:17,0
and they provoke cell division.


107
0:6:17,0 --> 0:6:19,467
But for the moment, I just want to look a little bit more


108
0:6:19,467 --> 0:6:22,33
about what happens to these root hairs,


109
0:6:22,33 --> 0:6:26,333
because if you think about it, root hairs are on the surface of the plant,


110
0:6:26,333 --> 0:6:30,0
they're single cells, they have a high surface-to-volume ratio...


111
0:6:30,0 --> 0:6:32,367
it makes sense that these are going to be


112
0:6:32,367 --> 0:6:34,367
exposed to the signals from the outside,


113
0:6:34,367 --> 0:6:38,1
and they might be the place where signal transduction begins.


114
0:6:38,1 --> 0:6:43,733
So, we might ask, by cell biology and by genetics,


115
0:6:43,733 --> 0:6:47,767
are there receptors, and what is the signal transduction pathway?


116
0:6:47,767 --> 0:6:49,967
And ask whether we can study root hairs


117
0:6:49,967 --> 0:6:51,633
as a way of capturing those.


118
0:6:51,633 --> 0:6:56,4
Now, signal transduction is often a complex and fairly rapid


119
0:6:56,4 --> 0:7:0,4
multiprotein process, so we set out to look for events


120
0:7:0,4 --> 0:7:6,567
that occur in root hairs that are cell autonomous and fairly rapid.


121
0:7:6,567 --> 0:7:10,633
One of the earliest studies that we did in this area was


122
0:7:10,633 --> 0:7:15,933
simply to look at the electrochemical potential across the plant membrane.


123
0:7:15,933 --> 0:7:20,0
So in this, we're taking a single root hair here,


124
0:7:20,0 --> 0:7:23,433
and by putting in a microelectrode and measuring the difference


125
0:7:23,433 --> 0:7:26,967
in potential between the interior of the cell and exterior of the cell,


126
0:7:26,967 --> 0:7:31,967
we were able to find that untreated root hairs have a stable,


127
0:7:31,967 --> 0:7:37,267
very negative potential at about -130 to -140 mV.


128
0:7:37,267 --> 0:7:40,7
However, if we treated a root hair with Rhizobium,


129
0:7:40,7 --> 0:7:45,5
what we found was that the Rhizobium and its Nod Factor


130
0:7:45,5 --> 0:7:49,967
are able to cause a depolarization of that plasma membrane,


131
0:7:49,967 --> 0:7:55,0
so that the potential change across the membrane here diminishes.


132
0:7:55,0 --> 0:7:58,167
And that happens actually within a minute.


133
0:7:58,167 --> 0:8:1,5
In our studies and others', this has been shown to be accompanied


134
0:8:1,5 --> 0:8:5,367
by ion fluxes (ion currents) near the tip.


135
0:8:5,367 --> 0:8:8,3
Now one ion in particular is very interesting to us,


136
0:8:8,3 --> 0:8:11,467
and that is calcium. We've used different techniques,


137
0:8:11,467 --> 0:8:13,967
but here's one of them that we have used.


138
0:8:13,967 --> 0:8:17,1
On the left, you can see a root hair,


139
0:8:17,1 --> 0:8:19,533
and into this root hair we're delivering a mixture of


140
0:8:19,533 --> 0:8:21,233
two different fluorescent proteins.


141
0:8:21,233 --> 0:8:25,33
One is fluorescent irrespective of the calcium concentration,


142
0:8:25,33 --> 0:8:28,9
the other increases its fluorescence when calcium is high.


143
0:8:28,9 --> 0:8:31,667
Using those two together, we can take a ratio


144
0:8:31,667 --> 0:8:34,1
and get the value of calcium corrected


145
0:8:34,1 --> 0:8:37,1
for the concentration of the cytoplasm.


146
0:8:37,1 --> 0:8:39,567
And then we can track that over time.


147
0:8:39,567 --> 0:8:42,967
So now we're going to follow calcium in this slide.


148
0:8:42,967 --> 0:8:45,767
Now, this is a pseudo-color representation


149
0:8:45,767 --> 0:8:50,267
of the fluorescence corrected for cytoplasmic concentration.


150
0:8:50,267 --> 0:8:55,633
Cool colors mean low calcium, warm colors mean high calcium.


151
0:8:55,633 --> 0:8:59,567
If you take a look at the root hairs here, they're all blue,


152
0:8:59,567 --> 0:9:0,933
that means low calcium.


153
0:9:0,933 --> 0:9:4,233
As you move in time, and these are ten second intervals,


154
0:9:4,233 --> 0:9:9,233
you see the warmer color, yellow, appearing from the tip of the root hair,


155
0:9:9,233 --> 0:9:12,9
so calcium is getting high at the tip.


156
0:9:12,9 --> 0:9:15,967
As you continue the time series up here,


157
0:9:15,967 --> 0:9:19,833
you can now get to a point where you see this extremely high calcium,


158
0:9:19,833 --> 0:9:23,67
shown by red, and this happens to be in the part of the


159
0:9:23,67 --> 0:9:26,2
cell represented by the nucleus.


160
0:9:26,2 --> 0:9:31,67
So, what can we say, and I'll quantify that with the following graphs.


161
0:9:31,67 --> 0:9:34,567
First, if you compare an untreated cell, that's here,


162
0:9:34,567 --> 0:9:38,233
and here's the baseline of the calcium, with the presentation of


163
0:9:38,233 --> 0:9:40,8
one nanomolar of Nod Factor,


164
0:9:40,8 --> 0:9:44,33
what you find is that about ten minutes after the presentation


165
0:9:44,33 --> 0:9:49,33
of the Nod Factor, you get these sharp upswings in calcium.


166
0:9:49,33 --> 0:9:51,833
And that's what's going on here.


167
0:9:51,833 --> 0:9:55,433
This is the calcium spiking represented there.


168
0:9:55,433 --> 0:10:0,967
Now, number two, if you put in a higher amount of Nod Factor,


169
0:10:0,967 --> 0:10:6,33
10 nanomolar, now you get something more complex.


170
0:10:6,33 --> 0:10:10,7
You get a faster response, and this turns out to be the


171
0:10:10,7 --> 0:10:15,333
tip flux of calcium coming in, and then calcium spiking


172
0:10:15,333 --> 0:10:18,0
happens at the same time.


173
0:10:18,0 --> 0:10:21,7
Now the other data that I'll show you here is that,


174
0:10:21,7 --> 0:10:25,133
if you take chitin alone...


175
0:10:25,133 --> 0:10:28,933
Now remember I pointed out that Nod Factor is like an


176
0:10:28,933 --> 0:10:32,8
oligomer of chitin N-acetylglucosamine resides,


177
0:10:32,8 --> 0:10:36,33
with some modifications. But what if you take the modifications off?


178
0:10:36,33 --> 0:10:38,867
It's not Nod Factor anymore, it's just chitin.


179
0:10:38,867 --> 0:10:46,967
If you add very, very large amounts of chitin,


180
0:10:46,967 --> 0:10:50,333
we've got one micromolar here, so a thousand-fold higher,


181
0:10:50,333 --> 0:10:56,533
you get some spiking, but you need much more chitin than Nod Factor,


182
0:10:56,533 --> 0:10:58,2
and it's not completely normal.


183
0:10:58,2 --> 0:11:2,5
So for that, we can say that the plant is


184
0:11:2,5 --> 0:11:5,8
exquisitely tuned to the Nod Factor.


185
0:11:5,8 --> 0:11:10,433
Finally, we do know that the calcium flux and calcium spiking


186
0:11:10,433 --> 0:11:17,1
are not just separated in space, but they're really independent


187
0:11:17,1 --> 0:11:23,533
in that you can add high Nod Factor after calcium spiking


188
0:11:23,533 --> 0:11:26,9
has started, and you'll get the big influx.


189
0:11:26,9 --> 0:11:31,133
So they really do appear to be two separate events.


190
0:11:31,133 --> 0:11:34,2
Now a third response that we were able to document


191
0:11:34,2 --> 0:11:37,67
very early in nodulation is this one:


192
0:11:37,67 --> 0:11:42,0
Using a whole seedling assay and with an indicator


193
0:11:42,0 --> 0:11:45,0
that shows the presence of hydrogen peroxide,


194
0:11:45,0 --> 0:11:49,367
we can follow normal roots over time,


195
0:11:49,367 --> 0:11:52,867
and we can assess how much peroxide are they producing.


196
0:11:52,867 --> 0:11:56,467
And in a normal, untreated root hair, that's shown here.


197
0:11:56,467 --> 0:11:59,267
They don't produce zero, they produce a modest amount,


198
0:11:59,267 --> 0:12:3,0
and here's what it looks like over a period of about 1.5 hours.


199
0:12:3,0 --> 0:12:5,633
Now what if we treat those with Nod Factor?


200
0:12:5,633 --> 0:12:10,0
What we find, very intriguingly, is that Nod Factor causes


201
0:12:10,0 --> 0:12:13,6
the rate of evolution to be diminished.


202
0:12:13,6 --> 0:12:18,967
So a lower level of hydrogen peroxide is produced


203
0:12:18,967 --> 0:12:22,3
in the presence of Nod Factor.


204
0:12:22,3 --> 0:12:26,533
Now what if we add an "elicitor," pathogenic elicitor?


205
0:12:26,533 --> 0:12:29,6
We would expect an elicitor to cause the plant to


206
0:12:29,6 --> 0:12:31,767
mount a defense response, and sure enough,


207
0:12:31,767 --> 0:12:35,633
if you look at the amount of hydrogen peroxide coming in the plant


208
0:12:35,633 --> 0:12:39,433
after the treatment with the elicitor, it's accelerated.


209
0:12:39,433 --> 0:12:45,8
So it seems that roots are able to elaborate hydrogen peroxide,


210
0:12:45,8 --> 0:12:49,167
an example of reactive oxygen species,


211
0:12:49,167 --> 0:12:51,6
that Nod Factor diminishes that,


212
0:12:51,6 --> 0:12:54,33
which would suggest it's lowering its defenses,


213
0:12:54,33 --> 0:12:59,867
and an elicitor increases it, consistent with an increase in defenses.


214
0:12:59,867 --> 0:13:2,6
Now, this is only over the couple of hours,


215
0:13:2,6 --> 0:13:6,167
we're interested here only in very early events.


216
0:13:6,167 --> 0:13:11,467
In fact, the defense reactions appear to have a very interesting


217
0:13:11,467 --> 0:13:17,467
and complex role later on in nodulation, but this is not related to those.


218
0:13:17,467 --> 0:13:20,833
This is just in the first two hours or so.


219
0:13:20,833 --> 0:13:22,933
So now we can fill in a bit what we know


220
0:13:22,933 --> 0:13:28,533
about the early responses of the plants to the rhizobial Nod Factor.


221
0:13:28,533 --> 0:13:36,833
We know that it causes nodules to form, cell divisions in the plant.


222
0:13:36,833 --> 0:13:41,533
We now can fill in that, in addition to the overall root hair curling,


223
0:13:41,533 --> 0:13:44,7
which we could see in the microscope,


224
0:13:44,7 --> 0:13:48,767
other kinds of assays demonstrate that there's a rapid depolarization


225
0:13:48,767 --> 0:13:52,767
across the plant plasma membrane in response to Nod Factor.


226
0:13:52,767 --> 0:13:55,333
This is accompanied by calcium flux.


227
0:13:55,333 --> 0:13:58,433
Slightly later there's calcium spiking in the cytoplasm and


228
0:13:58,433 --> 0:14:3,433
a suppression of the rate of reactive oxygen production.


229
0:14:3,433 --> 0:14:8,8
Now one other topic that I'll just mention briefly is transcription.


230
0:14:8,8 --> 0:14:13,433
We've been able to assess transcription during nodulation,


231
0:14:13,433 --> 0:14:18,533
at various stages, with a specialized approach,


232
0:14:18,533 --> 0:14:21,33
which is shown on the next slide.


233
0:14:21,33 --> 0:14:26,467
We, following our work on determining the complete genome


234
0:14:26,467 --> 0:14:32,167
sequence of the bacterium, we then constructed an Affymetrix chip


235
0:14:32,167 --> 0:14:34,8
in which we had the complete bacterial genome,


236
0:14:34,8 --> 0:14:40,533
plus about 10,000 sequences representing probable genes


237
0:14:40,533 --> 0:14:43,567
from EST libraries in the plant, and we put


238
0:14:43,567 --> 0:14:47,7
the two genomes on the same Affymetrix chip.


239
0:14:47,7 --> 0:14:54,0
So we call this our SymbioChip, and through analysis of RNA


240
0:14:54,0 --> 0:14:57,6
species from the nodules, we can actually get a readout of


241
0:14:57,6 --> 0:15:0,9
both bacteria and the plant at the same time.


242
0:15:0,9 --> 0:15:4,233
And through that, we were able to show that,


243
0:15:4,233 --> 0:15:9,867
within the first 24 hours after treatment with Nod Factor or


244
0:15:9,867 --> 0:15:15,33
after treatment with bacteria, a characteristic set of plant genes


245
0:15:15,33 --> 0:15:18,333
are upregulated or are downregulated.


246
0:15:18,333 --> 0:15:21,767
Some four dozen or so sequences,


247
0:15:21,767 --> 0:15:24,67
and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment when


248
0:15:24,67 --> 0:15:26,633
I get to the mutant analysis.


249
0:15:26,633 --> 0:15:30,7
But now, let me put all of those events on a timeline for you.


250
0:15:30,7 --> 0:15:32,9
So I'm going to start here on the left.


251
0:15:32,9 --> 0:15:36,533
Now, we know that in the very early stages, within a minute,


252
0:15:36,533 --> 0:15:41,967
we get calcium flux, suppression of reactive oxygen,


253
0:15:41,967 --> 0:15:43,7
we get a depolarization.


254
0:15:43,7 --> 0:15:46,567
There's also calcium spiking at about 10 minutes.


255
0:15:46,567 --> 0:15:48,5
There are morphological changes.


256
0:15:48,5 --> 0:15:51,933
You saw in the film that the root hairs pause


257
0:15:51,933 --> 0:15:55,0
and swell a little bit right before they start to curl.


258
0:15:55,0 --> 0:15:57,733
Then there's morphogenesis of the root hair,


259
0:15:57,733 --> 0:16:1,433
forming branches and curls and both.


260
0:16:1,433 --> 0:16:5,867
And we can see the cell divisions. Finally, the transcription.


261
0:16:5,867 --> 0:16:8,467
Now here's the timeline for that happening.


262
0:16:8,467 --> 0:16:12,833
If we start at time zero, and this is where the bacteria are being added,


263
0:16:12,833 --> 0:16:18,167
those first events, such as the calcium flux and the depolarization,


264
0:16:18,167 --> 0:16:21,67
happen within a few minutes, one to a few minutes.


265
0:16:21,67 --> 0:16:24,333
Calcium spiking at an average of 10 minutes.


266
0:16:24,333 --> 0:16:26,667
The gene expression that I mentioned, that we can assess


267
0:16:26,667 --> 0:16:30,467
with our Affymetrix chip, that's happening as early as a


268
0:16:30,467 --> 0:16:33,9
few hours and goes on for about 24 hours.


269
0:16:33,9 --> 0:16:37,7
Now the actual curling of the root hair, the deformation of the root hair,


270
0:16:37,7 --> 0:16:40,1
takes a while to express.


271
0:16:40,1 --> 0:16:44,333
Of course we have to keep in mind that this is limited by how


272
0:16:44,333 --> 0:16:46,767
fast the root hair can grow.


273
0:16:46,767 --> 0:16:49,833
We don't know when the decision to curl is made,


274
0:16:49,833 --> 0:16:52,867
but the actual outcome, the mechanics of curling,


275
0:16:52,867 --> 0:16:54,567
take somewhat longer.


276
0:16:54,567 --> 0:16:56,567
And then, here around 20 hours,


277
0:16:56,567 --> 0:16:58,733
we're going to start to get infection.


278
0:16:58,733 --> 0:17:2,367
The production of the infection thread and the ability of the bacteria


279
0:17:2,367 --> 0:17:5,433
now to penetrate in through that root hair.


280
0:17:5,433 --> 0:17:8,8
And then the cell division here leading


281
0:17:8,8 --> 0:17:13,3
to the production of the nodule, that's all happening over this


282
0:17:13,3 --> 0:17:16,0
period of a day to two days.


283
0:17:16,0 --> 0:17:21,6
Now through a set of genetic mutageneses and screens,


284
0:17:21,6 --> 0:17:25,6
our group and others have identified many different plant mutants


285
0:17:25,6 --> 0:17:30,133
that arrest at one or the other of these stages.


286
0:17:30,133 --> 0:17:33,67
And having these subcellular assays to do


287
0:17:33,67 --> 0:17:37,67
allowed us to distinguish between the different kinds of


288
0:17:37,67 --> 0:17:41,933
plant Nod- mutants. So here's an example.


289
0:17:41,933 --> 0:17:46,233
Here, on the left, is a gene called


290
0:17:46,233 --> 0:17:50,5
NFP for "Nod Factor perception." If that gene is mutated,


291
0:17:50,5 --> 0:17:54,3
you have a block right here, so nothing happens at all,


292
0:17:54,3 --> 0:17:58,1
there's no depolarization, there's no calcium flux,


293
0:17:58,1 --> 0:18:0,8
no change in the morphology.


294
0:18:0,8 --> 0:18:6,167
And then, here are two mutants that are


295
0:18:6,167 --> 0:18:10,9
present in such a way that they allow the plant to have calcium flux,


296
0:18:10,9 --> 0:18:15,333
and it has suppression of reactive oxygen species and so forth.


297
0:18:15,333 --> 0:18:18,0
However, it doesn't show calcium spiking.


298
0:18:18,0 --> 0:18:20,933
So these two mutants were able to distinguish


299
0:18:20,933 --> 0:18:25,233
between the early calcium flux and the calcium spiking itself.


300
0:18:25,233 --> 0:18:29,867
They are not only separated in the cell in geography and in time,


301
0:18:29,867 --> 0:18:33,0
but they can be separated genetically.


302
0:18:33,0 --> 0:18:39,967
Here, we found one or more mutants that allow calcium spiking


303
0:18:39,967 --> 0:18:42,733
but do not allow any gene expression.


304
0:18:42,733 --> 0:18:45,333
And so forth and so on down the line.


305
0:18:45,333 --> 0:18:49,133
So with all of this, we are able to set a timeline


306
0:18:49,133 --> 0:18:53,833
and a developmental sequence for how signals are transduced.


307
0:18:53,833 --> 0:18:58,33
And among other things, we were able to use that transcription assay


308
0:18:58,33 --> 0:19:3,633
to distinguish between root hair curling genes


309
0:19:3,633 --> 0:19:6,833
and early calcium transduction genes.


310
0:19:6,833 --> 0:19:10,833
And we were able to show that all of those plant genes


311
0:19:10,833 --> 0:19:14,7
that are expressed come on at the same time.


312
0:19:14,7 --> 0:19:18,167
It's not the case that you can get a few genes here,


313
0:19:18,167 --> 0:19:20,533
and a few more here, and a few more after that.


314
0:19:20,533 --> 0:19:25,367
You get no genes expressed at all, up until this point here.


315
0:19:25,367 --> 0:19:27,867
And we were able to show that by a combination of


316
0:19:27,867 --> 0:19:33,233
mutant analysis and transcription analysis.


317
0:19:33,233 --> 0:19:36,967
So that means we're going to be able to say that


318
0:19:36,967 --> 0:19:39,833
the series of events of shown here --


319
0:19:39,833 --> 0:19:44,867
calcium flux, suppression, growth arrest (the pausing) --


320
0:19:44,867 --> 0:19:50,3
can cluster, and we can see that one particular gene called NFP,


321
0:19:50,3 --> 0:19:52,3
which we believe encodes a receptor,


322
0:19:52,3 --> 0:19:55,933
is responsible and required for those events.


323
0:19:55,933 --> 0:20:0,233
Then there's a set of two genes, DMI1 and DMI2,


324
0:20:0,233 --> 0:20:3,4
that are required in order to get to calcium spiking.


325
0:20:3,4 --> 0:20:5,433
One of these is an ion channel,


326
0:20:5,433 --> 0:20:8,733
the other is a putative receptor kinase.


327
0:20:8,733 --> 0:20:13,8
Intriguingly, just downstream from calcium spiking


328
0:20:13,8 --> 0:20:17,933
is a mutant, DMI3, and another mutant, CYCLOPS;


329
0:20:17,933 --> 0:20:20,5
these are both required in order


330
0:20:20,5 --> 0:20:25,3
for any of the later events to occur, such as transcription.


331
0:20:25,3 --> 0:20:28,667
So we believe that these genes help interpret the


332
0:20:28,667 --> 0:20:32,267
calcium spiking signal and transduce it to the


333
0:20:32,267 --> 0:20:35,133
next set of genes, NSP1 and NSP2.


334
0:20:35,133 --> 0:20:38,367
These are required for transcription, and indeed,


335
0:20:38,367 --> 0:20:42,1
they turn out by sequence to be predicted transcription factors.


336
0:20:42,1 --> 0:20:45,3
More transcription factors are also required in order for


337
0:20:45,3 --> 0:20:48,333
nodulation to occur. Now all of these events


338
0:20:48,333 --> 0:20:54,67
on the right require the one pathway, this is called the signaling pathway,


339
0:20:54,67 --> 0:20:57,133
starting with the signaling receptor NFP1,


340
0:20:57,133 --> 0:20:59,867
and going through transcription factors.


341
0:20:59,867 --> 0:21:2,633
But I haven't said anything about infection,


342
0:21:2,633 --> 0:21:5,367
and I'd like to mention that.


343
0:21:5,367 --> 0:21:10,8
It turns out that the plants appear to have not one receptor, but two.


344
0:21:10,8 --> 0:21:15,367
The second receptor is called the "stringent" or "entry" receptor,


345
0:21:15,367 --> 0:21:20,733
and the name of that gene is LYK3, in the case of Medicago truncatula.


346
0:21:20,733 --> 0:21:23,533
This, and one of the transcription factors,


347
0:21:23,533 --> 0:21:26,733
are required in order for infection to occur.


348
0:21:26,733 --> 0:21:32,9
So you can have these other events happening, but no infection.


349
0:21:32,9 --> 0:21:38,267
This additional set of factors is required for infection.


350
0:21:38,267 --> 0:21:40,4
So back to the outline.


351
0:21:40,4 --> 0:21:43,567
I've gone through a description of some of the plant cell


352
0:21:43,567 --> 0:21:45,967
responses to Nod Factor, and told you about


353
0:21:45,967 --> 0:21:49,7
how we have used plant mutants, plus those cell phenotypes,


354
0:21:49,7 --> 0:21:53,2
in order to create an ordered set of steps that we believe


355
0:21:53,2 --> 0:21:57,933
represents the signal transduction pathway in early nodulation.


356
0:21:57,933 --> 0:22:2,433
In the next part of the talk, I'm now going to move, as I say,


357
0:22:2,433 --> 0:22:5,767
beyond nodulation: I'll be talking about infection


358
0:22:5,767 --> 0:22:10,4
and also about later stages in nodulation.


359
0:22:10,4 --> 0:22:14,867
So, as we think about the symbiosis, remember,


360
0:22:14,867 --> 0:22:18,8
everything that I described in terms of early signal transduction


361
0:22:18,8 --> 0:22:22,633
is over here. That's just the beginning.


362
0:22:22,633 --> 0:22:24,6
There's so much more to come.


363
0:22:24,6 --> 0:22:30,2
There's as the bacteria infect and eventually form the nodule.


364
0:22:30,2 --> 0:22:32,333
So now let's take a look at some of the


365
0:22:32,333 --> 0:22:36,433
specific topics that are interesting. First, infection.


366
0:22:36,433 --> 0:22:38,867
We've already seen that more genes are needed


367
0:22:38,867 --> 0:22:41,67
for infection than just for signaling.


368
0:22:41,67 --> 0:22:44,267
And the infection thread is a remarkable structure.


369
0:22:44,267 --> 0:22:47,767
It penetrates not just through the root hair,


370
0:22:47,767 --> 0:22:51,133
but then through multiple layers of plant cells,


371
0:22:51,133 --> 0:22:56,2
on its way in to find target cells.


372
0:22:56,2 --> 0:23:2,5
Now, as this proceeds, the plant elaborates an entire nodule,


373
0:23:2,5 --> 0:23:8,367
and all the dark cells in this photo are packed full of bacteria.


374
0:23:8,367 --> 0:23:10,867
And if you look close up at those,


375
0:23:10,867 --> 0:23:15,8
each bacterium is surrounded by an envelope of plant membrane,


376
0:23:15,8 --> 0:23:19,33
and within that, the bacteria are going to differentiate.


377
0:23:19,33 --> 0:23:21,6
So, using different approaches,


378
0:23:21,6 --> 0:23:25,633
we're going to take a look at how the plant manages


379
0:23:25,633 --> 0:23:28,167
to support these really remarkable events.


380
0:23:28,167 --> 0:23:33,333
We'll start with infection. As I mentioned,


381
0:23:33,333 --> 0:23:36,5
infection occurs beginning in the root hairs,


382
0:23:36,5 --> 0:23:38,0
and what we wanted to ask is,


383
0:23:38,0 --> 0:23:40,567
how does the inside of the plant cell


384
0:23:40,567 --> 0:23:42,867
cope with the invasion of the bacterium?


385
0:23:42,867 --> 0:23:44,7
How does it reorganize itself?


386
0:23:44,7 --> 0:23:50,367
We decided to take a look at some candidate genes called flotillins.


387
0:23:50,367 --> 0:23:54,67
These are genes that are originally identified in animals.


388
0:23:54,67 --> 0:23:57,133
I'll give a brief review, and then I'll show you


389
0:23:57,133 --> 0:24:3,733
our data that demonstrate that plant flotillins are active in nodulation.


390
0:24:3,733 --> 0:24:7,8
There's two copies of flotillins that are specifically upregulated


391
0:24:7,8 --> 0:24:13,167
in nodules, their transcription is regulated along with other


392
0:24:13,167 --> 0:24:18,667
nodulation genes, they're required for infection,


393
0:24:18,667 --> 0:24:21,933
they're required for elongation, and remarkably,


394
0:24:21,933 --> 0:24:25,233
the proteins of these flotillins have very striking


395
0:24:25,233 --> 0:24:28,67
localizations that we believe relate to the


396
0:24:28,67 --> 0:24:31,2
mechanism of infection. So, what are flotillins?


397
0:24:31,2 --> 0:24:34,367
They've been studied widely in animal cells.


398
0:24:34,367 --> 0:24:38,733
This diagram shows an animal cell with plasma membrane.


399
0:24:38,733 --> 0:24:44,167
Flotillins are shown here. There's two of them, they're outlined in red.


400
0:24:44,167 --> 0:24:47,233
They have a domain that is affiliated with the membrane,


401
0:24:47,233 --> 0:24:50,667
and a tail that is more cytoplasmic.


402
0:24:50,667 --> 0:24:56,833
And it is thought that they relate to signaling, to endocytosis,


403
0:24:56,833 --> 0:25:3,867
and to activity of the actin network within the cell.


404
0:25:3,867 --> 0:25:10,467
It's also been demonstrated that these flotillins occur


405
0:25:10,467 --> 0:25:14,533
in what are sometimes termed "membrane microdomains,"


406
0:25:14,533 --> 0:25:16,733
also sometimes called lipid rafts,


407
0:25:16,733 --> 0:25:24,1
although the terminologies are actively being discussed these days.


408
0:25:24,1 --> 0:25:25,967
Now plants have flotillins, too,


409
0:25:25,967 --> 0:25:29,1
although they have not been widely studied.


410
0:25:29,1 --> 0:25:31,1
In Arabidopsis, the sequence shows that


411
0:25:31,1 --> 0:25:33,9
there are three flotillins. In our analysis,


412
0:25:33,9 --> 0:25:41,367
we found more than seven in the legume Medicago truncatula.


413
0:25:41,367 --> 0:25:47,33
Of these seven, we found that two are uniquely expressed in nodules.


414
0:25:47,33 --> 0:25:50,733
We found that the proteins are, as with animals,


415
0:25:50,733 --> 0:25:55,733
flotillins present in small domains, or puncta.


416
0:25:55,733 --> 0:26:1,167
And I'll show you that one of the two has a very special localization


417
0:26:1,167 --> 0:26:2,833
during infection.


418
0:26:2,833 --> 0:26:6,67
Now, the predicted structures of the flotillins in plants


419
0:26:6,67 --> 0:26:7,833
looks very much like the animals',


420
0:26:7,833 --> 0:26:11,9
with a head domain and a tail domain,


421
0:26:11,9 --> 0:26:16,133
so we might expect that it's going to have some of the same properties.


422
0:26:16,133 --> 0:26:20,5
So, as I mentioned, Arabidopsis has only three flotillins,


423
0:26:20,5 --> 0:26:24,867
but Medicago truncatula has more than seven,


424
0:26:24,867 --> 0:26:27,7
and here's one of the really interesting things for us,


425
0:26:27,7 --> 0:26:31,0
is that there are a great number of these that are actually


426
0:26:31,0 --> 0:26:32,533
all linked together.


427
0:26:32,533 --> 0:26:35,833
Now you'll see here that there's flotillin 3 and 1,


428
0:26:35,833 --> 0:26:39,0
then there's down here flotillin 4 and flotillin 2.


429
0:26:39,0 --> 0:26:42,1
We believe that those are active flotillins.


430
0:26:42,1 --> 0:26:44,233
One of the others, shown here flotillin 5,


431
0:26:44,233 --> 0:26:51,4
is in the same genomic regiion, but we believe it's not an active gene.


432
0:26:51,4 --> 0:26:55,533
Now, we took a look at the activity of the promoters


433
0:26:55,533 --> 0:26:58,667
for each of those flotillins, and what you can see here is


434
0:26:58,667 --> 0:27:4,833
that the top, flotillin 1, its promoter is active in the vasculature.


435
0:27:4,833 --> 0:27:8,333
Here it's expressing a GUS fusion.


436
0:27:8,333 --> 0:27:12,233
Flotillin 3 is also active in the vasculature.


437
0:27:12,233 --> 0:27:15,533
But if you take a look at flotillin 2 and flotillin 4,


438
0:27:15,533 --> 0:27:19,33
these are being expressed in nodules.


439
0:27:19,33 --> 0:27:23,667
We can also quantify the transcript, and the same story emerges.


440
0:27:23,667 --> 0:27:26,5
We can see here that flotillin 1 and 3


441
0:27:26,5 --> 0:27:29,3
are at a low level throughout nodulation,


442
0:27:29,3 --> 0:27:34,533
but both flotillin 2 and flotillin 4 are strongly upregulated


443
0:27:34,533 --> 0:27:40,233
in the first day after roots are presented with bacteria.


444
0:27:40,233 --> 0:27:47,433
Flotillin 4 comes down, although flotillin 2 stays fairly well expressed


445
0:27:47,433 --> 0:27:51,567
during at least a couple of weeks of nodulation.


446
0:27:51,567 --> 0:27:54,2
So in terms of their expression,


447
0:27:54,2 --> 0:27:59,9
these appear to be especially associated with nodule development.


448
0:27:59,9 --> 0:28:3,767
Does that relate to any of the formalities that we know


449
0:28:3,767 --> 0:28:7,67
right now about the genetics of early nodulation?


450
0:28:7,67 --> 0:28:10,933
So remember that there are a set of genes that I introduced earlier,


451
0:28:10,933 --> 0:28:13,767
and we have mutations in these various


452
0:28:13,767 --> 0:28:18,867
steps for nodule signal transduction,


453
0:28:18,867 --> 0:28:24,2
and that transcription occurs only after a whole set of steps


454
0:28:24,2 --> 0:28:28,667
have taken place. So what about flotillin 2 and 4?


455
0:28:28,667 --> 0:28:32,67
And as you can see in this bar graph,


456
0:28:32,67 --> 0:28:36,533
those two flotillins actually require the same signal transduction pathway


457
0:28:36,533 --> 0:28:38,267
in order to be expressed.


458
0:28:38,267 --> 0:28:42,567
Here is a wild type on the left, we're seeing flotillin 2 and 4.


459
0:28:42,567 --> 0:28:47,2
And then here are a couple of the nodulation mutants.


460
0:28:47,2 --> 0:28:52,533
LYK3, NSP2, NIN-1, those are here.


461
0:28:52,533 --> 0:28:58,5
NSP and NIN, here's LYK3 for a receptor for Nod Factor.


462
0:28:58,5 --> 0:29:3,633
These appear to be required in order for the flotillins to be upregulated.


463
0:29:3,633 --> 0:29:6,3
We could also show that some of the downstream genes


464
0:29:6,3 --> 0:29:8,5
are not required.


465
0:29:8,5 --> 0:29:12,5
Now, we know that these flotillins are controlled


466
0:29:12,5 --> 0:29:15,433
in the same way nodulation genes are controlled,


467
0:29:15,433 --> 0:29:18,133
but what about their function?


468
0:29:18,133 --> 0:29:22,167
Through using RNAi approaches, we can diminish the


469
0:29:22,167 --> 0:29:28,4
activity of the various flotillins, and here's one particular experiment,


470
0:29:28,4 --> 0:29:31,767
and these results have been borne out in others',


471
0:29:31,767 --> 0:29:35,367
though the absolute numbers tend to vary.


472
0:29:35,367 --> 0:29:38,5
So if we take a look at a wild-type plant for example,


473
0:29:38,5 --> 0:29:42,2
we can see that it's got about six nodules per plant.


474
0:29:42,2 --> 0:29:46,8
If you knock out flotillin 1 and 3, there's again about six.


475
0:29:46,8 --> 0:29:52,67
But if you knock out flotillin 2, there's many fewer nodules.


476
0:29:52,67 --> 0:29:56,7
Flotillin 2 and flotillin 4, if knocked out together, is even more.


477
0:29:56,7 --> 0:29:58,767
But flotillin 4 knocked out by itself


478
0:29:58,767 --> 0:30:3,133
does not appear to have much an effect on the number of nodules.


479
0:30:3,133 --> 0:30:6,267
If you look at the percent of plants with nodules,


480
0:30:6,267 --> 0:30:7,933
you don't see a major effect.


481
0:30:7,933 --> 0:30:12,1
In fact, if anything, you seem to get a few increases


482
0:30:12,1 --> 0:30:16,533
of the percentage of plants that have some kind of growth on them.


483
0:30:16,533 --> 0:30:20,1
But now if we look at the percentage of nodules


484
0:30:20,1 --> 0:30:24,967
that are actually Fix+, which is indicated by the pink color


485
0:30:24,967 --> 0:30:29,167
from leghemoglobin, you can see that about,


486
0:30:29,167 --> 0:30:34,33
in this particular experiment, almost 30% of the wild-type nodules


487
0:30:34,33 --> 0:30:40,167
appear to be functioning, about the same for flotillin 1 and 3 knockouts.


488
0:30:40,167 --> 0:30:43,67
But if flotillin 2 is knocked out,


489
0:30:43,67 --> 0:30:48,8
then there's a striking diminution of the number of functional nodules,


490
0:30:48,8 --> 0:30:54,533
and a less striking but still significant change for flotillin 4.


491
0:30:54,533 --> 0:30:58,3
And the double mutant almost completely wipes out


492
0:30:58,3 --> 0:31:1,667
any effectiveness of the nodules that do form.


493
0:31:1,667 --> 0:31:5,433
So, we would conclude from that that flotillin 2 and flotillin 4


494
0:31:5,433 --> 0:31:9,4
are both required for nodulation, and that they are not redundant,


495
0:31:9,4 --> 0:31:12,3
because the double mutant has a more severe phenotype


496
0:31:12,3 --> 0:31:16,1
than either of the single mutants alone.


497
0:31:16,1 --> 0:31:18,833
We've also now gone to take a look at the proteins,


498
0:31:18,833 --> 0:31:21,267
and what we found is the following:


499
0:31:21,267 --> 0:31:24,767
Let's begin on the left with flotillin 2.


500
0:31:24,767 --> 0:31:26,933
This is a view of epidermal cells,


501
0:31:26,933 --> 0:31:29,7
so we're looking down at the surface of the root here.


502
0:31:29,7 --> 0:31:34,133
And you can see that flotillin 2 is present in little dots, or puncta,


503
0:31:34,133 --> 0:31:38,567
and there's a very striking localization of flotillin 2


504
0:31:38,567 --> 0:31:43,633
at the polar end of the cell.


505
0:31:43,633 --> 0:31:47,867
In the root hairs, the flotillin 2 is very strikingly punctate,


506
0:31:47,867 --> 0:31:55,767
it's present in these little dots, and this kind of distribution


507
0:31:55,767 --> 0:32:0,133
remains the case if the plants are inoculated,


508
0:32:0,133 --> 0:32:3,433
and that's shown in the lower part of the left-hand side.


509
0:32:3,433 --> 0:32:8,7
So, uninoculated and inoculated, flotillin 2 is punctate,


510
0:32:8,7 --> 0:32:13,567
it remains fairly stable, although there are some subtle changes


511
0:32:13,567 --> 0:32:16,767
in density and in polarity.


512
0:32:16,767 --> 0:32:21,67
But we got a very striking result with flotillin 4,


513
0:32:21,67 --> 0:32:23,933
and I'll show you that here. Now let's start on the top again.


514
0:32:23,933 --> 0:32:26,733
The epidermal cells and root hair cells,


515
0:32:26,733 --> 0:32:32,9
and it's very striking that the flotillin 4 signal (a GFP fusion signal)


516
0:32:32,9 --> 0:32:37,167
is present in puncta. But even more striking was that,


517
0:32:37,167 --> 0:32:42,8
after inoculation, what starts out as an even distribution of flotillin 4


518
0:32:42,8 --> 0:32:46,967
in root hairs becomes a highly polar distribution,


519
0:32:46,967 --> 0:32:49,367
and that's shown with these red arrows,


520
0:32:49,367 --> 0:32:52,4
where you can see that at the tips of these inoculated,


521
0:32:52,4 --> 0:32:58,2
bacteria-treated root hairs, flotillin 4 has migrated to the tip.


522
0:32:58,2 --> 0:33:4,233
So, that suggests that flotillin 4 has a very active participation


523
0:33:4,233 --> 0:33:7,433
in something having to do with what goes on at root hair tips.


524
0:33:7,433 --> 0:33:10,7
So we began to look specifically at infection,


525
0:33:10,7 --> 0:33:16,233
using wild type as control, where you can see bacteria invading.


526
0:33:16,233 --> 0:33:19,967
These blue, lac-stained bacteria show infection threads


527
0:33:19,967 --> 0:33:24,33
for bacteria on a wild-type plant.


528
0:33:24,33 --> 0:33:26,533
Here's a nice infection thread growing through a root hair


529
0:33:26,533 --> 0:33:29,833
on the wild type. But in a flotillin 4 "minus" mutant,


530
0:33:29,833 --> 0:33:32,67
things are not working very well.


531
0:33:32,67 --> 0:33:36,5
What you're seeing here is that there's no significant


532
0:33:36,5 --> 0:33:39,667
penetration deep into the nodule.


533
0:33:39,667 --> 0:33:42,233
Furthermore, even if you look at a root hair,


534
0:33:42,233 --> 0:33:49,3
the infection threads lack integrity, they're not well structured,


535
0:33:49,3 --> 0:33:54,733
and we find in fact that they don't succeed, they don't penetrate.


536
0:33:54,733 --> 0:33:59,133
So it appears that flotillin 4 function is important for infection threads,


537
0:33:59,133 --> 0:34:2,7
and we also now have evidence that shows that flotillin 4 is


538
0:34:2,7 --> 0:34:6,4
associated with infection threads.


539
0:34:6,4 --> 0:34:13,33
Flotillin 2 is shown here, bright green fluorescence around the cell.


540
0:34:13,33 --> 0:34:16,633
This particular root hair, which is curled, has been infected,


541
0:34:16,633 --> 0:34:21,133
and it has bacteria that fluoresce red. Those bacteria are shown here.


542
0:34:21,133 --> 0:34:26,33
But you can see that the flotillin 2 is around the membrane of the outer cell,


543
0:34:26,33 --> 0:34:31,2
it's not affected, not close by to the red fluorescence of the bacteria.


544
0:34:31,2 --> 0:34:35,4
However, if we look at flotillin 4, that's shown here.


545
0:34:35,4 --> 0:34:40,867
Flotillin 4-GFP is around the outside, but it's also here, see?


546
0:34:40,867 --> 0:34:44,4
Around the infection thread. Green fluorescence,


547
0:34:44,4 --> 0:34:47,367
and here's the red bacteria inside the fluorescence.


548
0:34:47,367 --> 0:34:51,167
So that suggests that flotillin 4 is affiliated with the


549
0:34:51,167 --> 0:34:53,67
infection thread membrane.


550
0:34:53,67 --> 0:34:57,867
Now you'll recall that, in the sequence of genes


551
0:34:57,867 --> 0:35:1,367
that are important for nodulation signal transduction,


552
0:35:1,367 --> 0:35:4,367
one set is called the signaling pathway, here,


553
0:35:4,367 --> 0:35:7,433
but more genes are needed in order to get infection,


554
0:35:7,433 --> 0:35:10,633
including the entry receptor LYK3.


555
0:35:10,633 --> 0:35:14,367
Now that we've got some clue that flotillins are involved in infection,


556
0:35:14,367 --> 0:35:18,733
we might want to ask whether we can place flotillins in any kind of


557
0:35:18,733 --> 0:35:21,767
relationship to the genes that have been previously found


558
0:35:21,767 --> 0:35:24,9
to be important for early signaling and infection.


559
0:35:24,9 --> 0:35:27,767
Now, in the following photos,


560
0:35:27,767 --> 0:35:33,2
I'm looking at the puncta density of flotillin 4.


561
0:35:33,2 --> 0:35:37,633
Here's a wild type, and the puncta density is the number of


562
0:35:37,633 --> 0:35:40,933
bright spots per square micron,


563
0:35:40,933 --> 0:35:45,367
so you might have a little square micron there,


564
0:35:45,367 --> 0:35:47,867
and then you plot the number.


565
0:35:47,867 --> 0:35:52,233
And I'm going to compare that wild type to three different mutants.


566
0:35:52,233 --> 0:35:56,667
Each of these is a mutant in the putative entry receptor LYK3.


567
0:35:56,667 --> 0:36:0,7
lyk3-1, which is the most severe,


568
0:36:0,7 --> 0:36:6,767
and two other alleles, lyk3-2 and 3-4.


569
0:36:6,767 --> 0:36:13,833
The lyk3-1 is predicted to have a protein with a dead kinase domain,


570
0:36:13,833 --> 0:36:17,233
and what we saw looking at this particular index of


571
0:36:17,233 --> 0:36:22,4
puncta density is that, if you compare the wild-type number here


572
0:36:22,4 --> 0:36:27,33
to the number in the lyk3-1 mutant, the puncta density for FLOT4


573
0:36:27,33 --> 0:36:30,533
is greatly diminished, significantly lower.


574
0:36:30,533 --> 0:36:33,3
We don't draw any mechanistic conclusion from this,


575
0:36:33,3 --> 0:36:37,33
but it did give us the sense that maybe LYK3 itself,


576
0:36:37,33 --> 0:36:41,767
together with FLOT4, would be worth looking at.


577
0:36:41,767 --> 0:36:46,4
So we want to ask whether LYK3 and flotillin 4 interact.


578
0:36:46,4 --> 0:36:48,9
We're going to need to study LYK3,


579
0:36:48,9 --> 0:36:52,733
and we were fortunate to collaborate with Doug Cook, Brendan Riely,


580
0:36:52,733 --> 0:36:57,333
and their colleagues at UC Davis, and thanks to their contributions,


581
0:36:57,333 --> 0:36:59,967
we have the following tools for study:


582
0:36:59,967 --> 0:37:3,733
First and most importantly, a stable transgenic of


583
0:37:3,733 --> 0:37:7,733
Medicago truncatula that carries a GFP fusion to LYK3,


584
0:37:7,733 --> 0:37:10,0
under the control of its own promoter.


585
0:37:10,0 --> 0:37:13,2
It's known that this is functional because it complements


586
0:37:13,2 --> 0:37:15,633
a lyk3-1 mutant.


587
0:37:15,633 --> 0:37:19,0
Because it's under its own promoter, we have more reassurance


588
0:37:19,0 --> 0:37:22,567
about its correct position and localization.


589
0:37:22,567 --> 0:37:27,367
Now into this stable transgenic, we're now going to introduce


590
0:37:27,367 --> 0:37:31,67
a second marker, we're going to create a transformant


591
0:37:31,67 --> 0:37:37,767
that also has flotillin 4 linked to the fluorescent mCherry protein,


592
0:37:37,767 --> 0:37:41,133
so we'll have green fluorescence for LYK3, red fluorescence for FLOT4.


593
0:37:41,133 --> 0:37:44,567
And our particular tool is going to be a spinning-disk confocal


594
0:37:44,567 --> 0:37:50,133
at the Carnegie Institution, in collaboration with David Ehrhardt.


595
0:37:50,133 --> 0:37:57,267
We were able to visualize the LYK3 putative receptor in root hairs.


596
0:37:57,267 --> 0:37:59,3
So the results are shown here.


597
0:37:59,3 --> 0:38:2,867
We have LYK3-GFP, it's present in the root hair,


598
0:38:2,867 --> 0:38:7,233
you can see that it's punctate.


599
0:38:7,233 --> 0:38:12,467
And when we took a look at the LYK3 plant with infections,


600
0:38:12,467 --> 0:38:16,67
we found the following: Here's a curled root hair,


601
0:38:16,67 --> 0:38:18,533
and you can see going down through the curled root hair


602
0:38:18,533 --> 0:38:21,967
is an infection thread, and the green fluorescence of


603
0:38:21,967 --> 0:38:25,867
that LYK3 is all the way along the infection thread membrane,


604
0:38:25,867 --> 0:38:30,233
so we can see that the LYK3 putative receptor is localizing


605
0:38:30,233 --> 0:38:35,4
the same way that the flotillin 4 appears to do along the


606
0:38:35,4 --> 0:38:38,333
infection thread, as it moves into the cell.


607
0:38:38,333 --> 0:38:41,733
Now, an important control is shown here also.


608
0:38:41,733 --> 0:38:46,33
Root hairs and other parts of plant cell walls have


609
0:38:46,33 --> 0:38:50,2
autofluorescence as well, and we wanted to ask whether


610
0:38:50,2 --> 0:38:54,533
the green fluorescence we saw here was really due to the LYK3,


611
0:38:54,533 --> 0:38:56,3
or was it autofluorescence.


612
0:38:56,3 --> 0:38:59,667
The results of that are shown in this other panel.


613
0:38:59,667 --> 0:39:5,533
Now, this is a fusion of LYK3 to a nonfluorescent protein.


614
0:39:5,533 --> 0:39:8,933
And again, there are bacteria that are fluorescing red.


615
0:39:8,933 --> 0:39:11,567
Well, what you can see is that it's a good idea


616
0:39:11,567 --> 0:39:15,1
to do this control because the crook of the root hair


617
0:39:15,1 --> 0:39:19,0
is very highly autofluorescent, so if we were to see this


618
0:39:19,0 --> 0:39:22,267
and say it's GFP fluorescence, we'd be wrong,


619
0:39:22,267 --> 0:39:25,767
because that's just what root hair cell wall is doing.


620
0:39:25,767 --> 0:39:29,2
You can see here the infection thread is moving down


621
0:39:29,2 --> 0:39:34,0
with the red fluorescence, and there is no


622
0:39:34,0 --> 0:39:35,633
green fluorescence around it.


623
0:39:35,633 --> 0:39:39,367
So infection threads are not intrinsically fluorescent;


624
0:39:39,367 --> 0:39:44,7
it's only that the LYK3-GFP is providing that signal.


625
0:39:44,7 --> 0:39:48,533
So now we know that flotillin 4 and LYK3 appear


626
0:39:48,533 --> 0:39:50,4
to localize to the same place.


627
0:39:50,4 --> 0:39:53,433
Can we find out anything else about them?


628
0:39:53,433 --> 0:40:1,8
So in this, we have started to use that double transgenic.


629
0:40:1,8 --> 0:40:6,8
So what's going on here is that this plant has LYK3-GFP.


630
0:40:6,8 --> 0:40:9,667
It also has flotillin 4-mCherry.


631
0:40:9,667 --> 0:40:14,167
Now, these are closeups below, you can see the LYK3-GFP,


632
0:40:14,167 --> 0:40:16,167
flotillin 4-mCherry.


633
0:40:16,167 --> 0:40:19,667
And these are uninfected root hairs.


634
0:40:19,667 --> 0:40:21,633
And if you merge the two images,


635
0:40:21,633 --> 0:40:26,0
it's possible to see here that the green and red are distinct.


636
0:40:26,0 --> 0:40:29,167
So that suggests that they are not co-localizing


637
0:40:29,167 --> 0:40:32,167
within the distance where their fluorescence would


638
0:40:32,167 --> 0:40:35,367
mix and make a yellow color.


639
0:40:35,367 --> 0:40:38,433
Now, taking a look at that more statistically,


640
0:40:38,433 --> 0:40:41,8
we can do a correlation plot, as shown here,


641
0:40:41,8 --> 0:40:47,5
where on one axis, on the x-axis, that's the fluorescence intensity of one,


642
0:40:47,5 --> 0:40:51,267
on the y-axis is the fluorescence intensity of the other.


643
0:40:51,267 --> 0:40:55,167
And in fact, there's a distribution all the way around,


644
0:40:55,167 --> 0:40:57,67
it doesn't particularly correlate.


645
0:40:57,67 --> 0:40:59,633
If you have a high fluorescence of mCherry,


646
0:40:59,633 --> 0:41:4,4
that could be either low or high fluorescence of GFP.


647
0:41:4,4 --> 0:41:10,5
But what happens when we treat root hairs with bacteria?


648
0:41:10,5 --> 0:41:12,4
And that's shown here.


649
0:41:12,4 --> 0:41:16,867
Now, again we've got the GFP, here's a closeup.


650
0:41:16,867 --> 0:41:20,3
We've got the mCherry for the flotillins, and a closeup.


651
0:41:20,3 --> 0:41:22,833
But now, when we do the co-localization,


652
0:41:22,833 --> 0:41:25,967
you can see that there appears to be a


653
0:41:25,967 --> 0:41:28,833
merging of the green and red fluorescence,


654
0:41:28,833 --> 0:41:33,8
to present a higher number of puncta that look yellow.


655
0:41:33,8 --> 0:41:37,0
So we would say there appears to be an increase


656
0:41:37,0 --> 0:41:41,167
in the correlation of their location,


657
0:41:41,167 --> 0:41:43,733
and here's another way of looking at that.


658
0:41:43,733 --> 0:41:48,867
The correlation plot now shows a correlation coefficient


659
0:41:48,867 --> 0:41:52,5
that's more than 0.5.


660
0:41:52,5 --> 0:41:55,367
That means that more than half the time,


661
0:41:55,367 --> 0:41:58,133
you're getting a correlation of the intensity of fluorescence


662
0:41:58,133 --> 0:42:0,267
of one and the other.


663
0:42:0,267 --> 0:42:5,433
So that suggests to us that whether or not flotillin 4 and LKY3


664
0:42:5,433 --> 0:42:8,433
are associated depends on


665
0:42:8,433 --> 0:42:11,833
whether the bacteria have interacted with the root hair.


666
0:42:11,833 --> 0:42:14,1
So we pursued that a little more.


667
0:42:14,1 --> 0:42:16,867
Another way that we have started to look at that


668
0:42:16,867 --> 0:42:20,7
is to examine the dynamics, not just the location,


669
0:42:20,7 --> 0:42:23,567
but dynamics of what these proteins are doing.


670
0:42:23,567 --> 0:42:28,733
So in this experiment, we're going to be looking at a root hair


671
0:42:28,733 --> 0:42:33,867
which has a LYK3-GFP fusion, so that's the only fluorescence


672
0:42:33,867 --> 0:42:37,433
you're going to see, it's just the receptor LYK3.


673
0:42:37,433 --> 0:42:40,1
And what you're going to be seeing in the micrographs


674
0:42:40,1 --> 0:42:44,667
is as if you took a plane like this, right?


675
0:42:44,667 --> 0:42:49,667
Through the root hair and, where you see this bright point,


676
0:42:49,667 --> 0:42:54,733
that's what is going to be shown now on the films.


677
0:42:54,733 --> 0:42:56,367
Now the left-hand...


678
0:42:56,367 --> 0:43:1,567
we're going to look at LYK3 in an uninfected root hair.


679
0:43:1,567 --> 0:43:5,567
So one of the things you can see is that it's very dynamic.


680
0:43:5,567 --> 0:43:10,433
If you try to focus on a point and follow the LYK3,


681
0:43:10,433 --> 0:43:13,933
it's moving around too much, you can't do that.


682
0:43:13,933 --> 0:43:19,0
But now let's look at a root hair that has been treated with bacteria.


683
0:43:19,0 --> 0:43:20,333
What a difference.


684
0:43:20,333 --> 0:43:22,467
Now you're looking at the LYK3 fluorescence,


685
0:43:22,467 --> 0:43:25,667
and it's really behaving itself. It's sort of staying place,


686
0:43:25,667 --> 0:43:27,5
and these two arrowheads, for example,


687
0:43:27,5 --> 0:43:29,533
show places that you can focus in,


688
0:43:29,533 --> 0:43:34,967
and you can see a LYK3 signal that's not moving, that's fairly stable.


689
0:43:34,967 --> 0:43:40,233
So that suggests to us that it's not just where LYK3 is,


690
0:43:40,233 --> 0:43:45,4
it's how fast it's moving and perhaps shuttling around,


691
0:43:45,4 --> 0:43:47,8
that is being changed by the presence of the bacteria,


692
0:43:47,8 --> 0:43:52,967
which is remarkable, and that led us to another way


693
0:43:52,967 --> 0:43:56,6
to look at LYK3 together with flotillin 4.


694
0:43:56,6 --> 0:43:59,167
In the following, we won't be looking at movies,


695
0:43:59,167 --> 0:44:1,933
but we'll be representing the dynamics over time


696
0:44:1,933 --> 0:44:3,667
through what's called a kymograph.


697
0:44:3,667 --> 0:44:9,7
Now what you're seeing on the left is a micrograph of the receptor


698
0:44:9,7 --> 0:44:14,8
LYK3-GFP fluorescence, flotillin 4 fluorescence, and the merge.


699
0:44:14,8 --> 0:44:19,533
Likewise, here for bacterially treated root hairs,


700
0:44:19,533 --> 0:44:24,733
LYK3-GFP, flotillin 4-mCherry, and then the merge.


701
0:44:24,733 --> 0:44:30,533
Now, at each point in time, we don't look at the whole root hair,


702
0:44:30,533 --> 0:44:34,2
we're going to just be looking at a transect shown here,


703
0:44:34,2 --> 0:44:38,167
and also shown over here, by these blue arrows.


704
0:44:38,167 --> 0:44:42,433
And at any one point in time, just that line is going to


705
0:44:42,433 --> 0:44:45,433
be represented as follows.


706
0:44:45,433 --> 0:44:54,433
Here, if we take this line going across the uninfected LYK3-GFP,


707
0:44:54,433 --> 0:44:58,367
then we can see at one 10-second period


708
0:44:58,367 --> 0:45:1,767
whether a particular position was light or dark.


709
0:45:1,767 --> 0:45:5,2
We can follow that over time and we can see that the correlation


710
0:45:5,2 --> 0:45:9,367
is rather loose. However, flotillin 4 is very stable;


711
0:45:9,367 --> 0:45:12,233
if you look at the flotillin 4,


712
0:45:12,233 --> 0:45:15,67
10 seconds, 20 seconds, and so forth...


713
0:45:15,67 --> 0:45:18,533
if it's fluorescent at one 10-second interval,


714
0:45:18,533 --> 0:45:20,633
it's highly likely to be fluorescent in the next one,


715
0:45:20,633 --> 0:45:24,933
and so you get this set of lines going through.


716
0:45:24,933 --> 0:45:28,33
Now, if we take a look at root hairs that are treated with bacteria,


717
0:45:28,33 --> 0:45:31,767
we find the following.


718
0:45:31,767 --> 0:45:36,1
Again, this is what the root hairs look like,


719
0:45:36,1 --> 0:45:39,767
but if we follow them over time, you can now see that the LYK3-GFP


720
0:45:39,767 --> 0:45:44,533
is very stable. If that transect shows a bright point


721
0:45:44,533 --> 0:45:46,967
at one 10-second interval, it's probably going to be bright


722
0:45:46,967 --> 0:45:52,67
the next 10-second interval as well, so the LYK3 has settled down,


723
0:45:52,67 --> 0:45:57,267
the flotillin 4 is still very stable, and when you take a look at the merge,


724
0:45:57,267 --> 0:46:2,33
you can see that there appears to be a correlation of the brightness.


725
0:46:2,33 --> 0:46:6,733
So, as we summarize, we can say the following:


726
0:46:6,733 --> 0:46:14,67
That the puncta density is changed for FLOT4-GFP


727
0:46:14,67 --> 0:46:18,333
in a genetic background where LYK3 is mutated.


728
0:46:18,333 --> 0:46:23,667
We can see that LYK3 itself localizes in puncta


729
0:46:23,667 --> 0:46:26,3
that suggests it's in membrane microdomains.


730
0:46:26,3 --> 0:46:29,833
Also, it also localizes to infection threads.


731
0:46:29,833 --> 0:46:35,0
We found that in uninfected root hairs, the receptor


732
0:46:35,0 --> 0:46:39,0
and the flotillin do not have much overlap,


733
0:46:39,0 --> 0:46:43,333
and also they are very different in their motility, in their dynamics.


734
0:46:43,333 --> 0:46:48,533
However, after inoculation with Sinorhizobium meliloti,


735
0:46:48,533 --> 0:46:51,933
the receptor and the flotillin co-localize,


736
0:46:51,933 --> 0:46:54,867
and their dynamics remain similar.


737
0:46:54,867 --> 0:46:58,33
Not known is whether this is direct or indirect.


738
0:46:58,33 --> 0:47:0,9
What is the nature of the protein-protein interactions?


739
0:47:0,9 --> 0:47:6,567
Because fluorescence in and of itself is relatively loose,


740
0:47:6,567 --> 0:47:11,967
it does not have to have precise molecular adjacency.


741
0:47:11,967 --> 0:47:16,367
So further fluorescence studies with FRET


742
0:47:16,367 --> 0:47:18,733
and biochemical studies will be necessary,


743
0:47:18,733 --> 0:47:22,467
and we think that following the combination of


744
0:47:22,467 --> 0:47:26,8
flotillins and receptors is going to be a very exciting way


745
0:47:26,8 --> 0:47:31,933
to ask how the plant is mobilizing itself to accept infection.


746
0:47:31,933 --> 0:47:33,733
So back to the outline.


747
0:47:33,733 --> 0:47:38,633
I've finished talking a little bit about how a candidate gene approach


748
0:47:38,633 --> 0:47:42,3
took us from the study of flotillins to the study of infection.


749
0:47:42,3 --> 0:47:46,167
In this next segment, I'd like to talk about some mutants


750
0:47:46,167 --> 0:47:49,6
that we've isolated called the dnf mutants.


751
0:47:49,6 --> 0:47:52,3
These have identified plants genes


752
0:47:52,3 --> 0:47:55,8
necessary for the final stages of symbiosis.


753
0:47:55,8 --> 0:47:59,0
And I'll talk about two of those, DNF1,


754
0:47:59,0 --> 0:48:1,33
which encodes a signal peptidase,


755
0:48:1,33 --> 0:48:5,0
and DNF2, a putative phospholipase C.


756
0:48:5,0 --> 0:48:7,767
So looking again at the sequence of nodulation,


757
0:48:7,767 --> 0:48:11,6
we're now taking a look at an even later stage,


758
0:48:11,6 --> 0:48:15,567
where bacteria have penetrated into the nodule,


759
0:48:15,567 --> 0:48:22,367
and they get released into the cells, and they're able to fix nitrogen.


760
0:48:22,367 --> 0:48:27,133
So the dnf mutants, called "defective in nitrogen fixation,"


761
0:48:27,133 --> 0:48:30,533
were isolated out of a screen that we did of


762
0:48:30,533 --> 0:48:34,67
mutants that we generated by fast neutron bombardment.


763
0:48:34,67 --> 0:48:39,433
This often creates deletions, it's an ionizing radiation,


764
0:48:39,433 --> 0:48:41,933
and so these are severe mutants.


765
0:48:41,933 --> 0:48:45,667
When we screen them, we found a number of mutants


766
0:48:45,667 --> 0:48:48,4
which were like this. Instead of being nice,


767
0:48:48,4 --> 0:48:51,467
pink nodules here, the dnf mutants are white,


768
0:48:51,467 --> 0:48:55,7
and they're small. They don't have any nitrogenase activity,


769
0:48:55,7 --> 0:48:58,433
and that's shown in this slide


770
0:48:58,433 --> 0:49:2,833
by assessment of acetylene reduction, shown here.


771
0:49:2,833 --> 0:49:5,7
Wild type is able to convert acetylene to ethylene,


772
0:49:5,7 --> 0:49:8,867
which an indicator for nitrogenase enzyme.


773
0:49:8,867 --> 0:49:10,567
But the dnf mutants, as you can see,


774
0:49:10,567 --> 0:49:15,733
have very low or even no ability to fix nitrogen.


775
0:49:15,733 --> 0:49:20,233
Now, they also don't seem to have completely normal development.


776
0:49:20,233 --> 0:49:22,467
One of the mutants, dnf1, is shown here,


777
0:49:22,467 --> 0:49:25,333
and we got two alleles of that, they're very similar.


778
0:49:25,333 --> 0:49:31,467
A wild-type nodule has cells filled with bacteria.


779
0:49:31,467 --> 0:49:36,233
The bacteria do get infected into the dnf1 nodules as well;


780
0:49:36,233 --> 0:49:39,3
nonetheless, they are not as large,


781
0:49:39,3 --> 0:49:43,3
and they do not seem to be able to fix nitrogen.


782
0:49:43,3 --> 0:49:47,6
So we took a look further at dnf1,


783
0:49:47,6 --> 0:49:53,767
and one of the ways in which we studied this was as follows.


784
0:49:53,767 --> 0:49:59,333
Here's a wild-type nodule shown in section, and this nodule,


785
0:49:59,333 --> 0:50:4,9
in this case, has been established by the action of a bacterium


786
0:50:4,9 --> 0:50:8,9
carrying a glucuronidase fusion into the promoter


787
0:50:8,9 --> 0:50:13,1
for the nitrogenase gene. That means that if the bacteria


788
0:50:13,1 --> 0:50:18,633
are expressing their nitrogenase, then the nodule will turn blue


789
0:50:18,633 --> 0:50:21,3
in the presence of a glucuronidase substrate.


790
0:50:21,3 --> 0:50:26,267
So, what we see here is that the nifH (which is nitrogenase)-glucuronidase


791
0:50:26,267 --> 0:50:28,67
fusion is turned on.


792
0:50:28,67 --> 0:50:31,5
That's good, that means that the bacteria are expressing their


793
0:50:31,5 --> 0:50:33,533
nitrogen fixation genes.


794
0:50:33,533 --> 0:50:38,467
However, what we found with the dnf1 was the following:


795
0:50:38,467 --> 0:50:42,533
Taking a look at these nodules with the same exact bacterium


796
0:50:42,533 --> 0:50:47,467
carrying a glucuronidase fusion to the nif promoter, we found no activity.


797
0:50:47,467 --> 0:50:50,467
You could see here with the red arrow; it's pointing toward the nodule,


798
0:50:50,467 --> 0:50:51,733
but there's no blue stain.


799
0:50:51,733 --> 0:50:55,767
So we conclude from this that the bacteria are not able to


800
0:50:55,767 --> 0:50:59,167
express the genes for nitrogen fixation.


801
0:50:59,167 --> 0:51:3,933
So we can say that the bacteria need the plant's DNF1


802
0:51:3,933 --> 0:51:6,1
in order for the bacteria to fix nitrogen,


803
0:51:6,1 --> 0:51:9,4
or even to express their nitrogen fixation genes.


804
0:51:9,4 --> 0:51:14,33
So what is dnf1? This gene in the plant encodes


805
0:51:14,33 --> 0:51:18,1
one of the subunits of what turns out to be a nodule-specific


806
0:51:18,1 --> 0:51:19,567
signal peptidase.


807
0:51:19,567 --> 0:51:21,4
And I'll tell you about nodule-specific


808
0:51:21,4 --> 0:51:23,3
and the other components in a moment.


809
0:51:23,3 --> 0:51:26,6
But first I'll just review a little bit what signal peptidase is.


810
0:51:26,6 --> 0:51:31,167
In a eukaryotic cell, we've got the endoplasmic reticulum,


811
0:51:31,167 --> 0:51:36,133
and proteins that are extruded into the lumen


812
0:51:36,133 --> 0:51:38,9
may get there by a signal peptide,


813
0:51:38,9 --> 0:51:43,967
and if the signal peptidase cleaves off that signal peptide,


814
0:51:43,967 --> 0:51:47,1
and that allows the production of the mature protein,


815
0:51:47,1 --> 0:51:48,9
which would be shown here.


816
0:51:48,9 --> 0:51:51,833
Now, once that mature protein is formed,


817
0:51:51,833 --> 0:51:54,367
after its signal peptide is taken off,


818
0:51:54,367 --> 0:52:0,67
then it may be targeted for secretion or for vesicle trafficking.


819
0:52:0,67 --> 0:52:2,733
So what we found is that DNF1,


820
0:52:2,733 --> 0:52:7,1
required for bacterial gene expression and differentiation,


821
0:52:7,1 --> 0:52:10,6
has something to do with protein processing.


822
0:52:10,6 --> 0:52:13,333
Now let's take a look at the expression of this gene.


823
0:52:13,333 --> 0:52:15,833
If you take a look at the vegetative parts of the plant,


824
0:52:15,833 --> 0:52:20,233
such as the leaf and stem or flowers,


825
0:52:20,233 --> 0:52:25,533
what you find is that expression of the DNF1 signal peptidase subunit


826
0:52:25,533 --> 0:52:29,233
is very low, but it's quite high in nodules.


827
0:52:29,233 --> 0:52:32,6
It's also present to some extent in developing seeds,


828
0:52:32,6 --> 0:52:34,733
although at a much lower level.


829
0:52:34,733 --> 0:52:37,967
Taking a look at the time course, what we can see is here.


830
0:52:37,967 --> 0:52:43,1
The DNF1, if you plot days of nodule growth and development,


831
0:52:43,1 --> 0:52:45,6
and DNF1 expression, you can see that DNF1


832
0:52:45,6 --> 0:52:49,9
goes up early in nodule development.


833
0:52:49,9 --> 0:52:52,333
You can also track it during seeds and find that


834
0:52:52,333 --> 0:52:56,4
it's relatively steady during the maturation of seeds.


835
0:52:56,4 --> 0:52:59,367
So, DNF1 is most highly expressed in nodules


836
0:52:59,367 --> 0:53:2,9
and it goes up very early in those nodules.


837
0:53:2,9 --> 0:53:9,467
Now, let's take a look not just at DNF1, but using transcription,


838
0:53:9,467 --> 0:53:12,2
let's take a look at what genes,


839
0:53:12,2 --> 0:53:15,867
out of all the microarray data, tend to be expressed


840
0:53:15,867 --> 0:53:19,167
whenever DNF1 is expressed, and those are shown here.


841
0:53:19,167 --> 0:53:24,9
Now, on the left, you can see the names of the proteins.


842
0:53:24,9 --> 0:53:27,3
This is what they do, and what you can see is that there's


843
0:53:27,3 --> 0:53:34,9
the other subunits in the signal peptidase complex,


844
0:53:34,9 --> 0:53:40,467
are also regulated up in early nodules the same way the DNF1 is.


845
0:53:40,467 --> 0:53:42,533
In addition, the signal peptide peptidase,


846
0:53:42,533 --> 0:53:47,733
which is needed for completion of the degradation of the signal peptide,


847
0:53:47,733 --> 0:53:49,767
that's also upregulated.


848
0:53:49,767 --> 0:53:55,967
And finally, this very intriguing protein, SYP132, syntaxin 132...


849
0:53:55,967 --> 0:53:57,9
Now what are syntaxins?


850
0:53:57,9 --> 0:54:2,9
This is a reminder of how they have been characterized in animal cells;


851
0:54:2,9 --> 0:54:10,167
syntaxins are important proteins for vesicle targeting, and in fact,


852
0:54:10,167 --> 0:54:16,467
SYP132 here in the plant probably marks the last step of protein secretion,


853
0:54:16,467 --> 0:54:20,967
and empirically, it has been observed on plant plasma membranes


854
0:54:20,967 --> 0:54:24,5
and also on what's called the symbiosome membrane.


855
0:54:24,5 --> 0:54:28,833
That's the membrane that surrounds the bacterium once it's inside the cell.


856
0:54:28,833 --> 0:54:31,133
So if we take a look at all of these genes,


857
0:54:31,133 --> 0:54:34,133
we can see that they are co-regulated.


858
0:54:34,133 --> 0:54:38,67
So we've got a whole signal peptidase complex, and what is it doing?


859
0:54:38,67 --> 0:54:40,7
One of the most important questions that could be asked is,


860
0:54:40,7 --> 0:54:42,533
what are the substrates?


861
0:54:42,533 --> 0:54:46,733
What proteins does this signal peptidase help to mature?


862
0:54:46,733 --> 0:54:49,767
And the answer came from work in the labs


863
0:54:49,767 --> 0:54:53,8
in Gif-sur-Yvette and in Szeged, Hungary,


864
0:54:53,8 --> 0:54:57,933
led by Eva Kondorosi and Peter Mergaert, and their colleagues.


865
0:54:57,933 --> 0:55:0,533
And what they have described is a set of proteins


866
0:55:0,533 --> 0:55:4,867
called "nodule cysteine-rich peptides."


867
0:55:4,867 --> 0:55:7,767
These are characteristic of nodules,


868
0:55:7,767 --> 0:55:10,6
they are not expressed anyplace else in the plant.


869
0:55:10,6 --> 0:55:14,7
And they are rich in cysteine and bear some resemblance to defensins,


870
0:55:14,7 --> 0:55:18,967
which are proteins made by plants and animals


871
0:55:18,967 --> 0:55:21,0
in response to microbes.


872
0:55:21,0 --> 0:55:26,1
They were able to show using our dnf1 mutant, that one of these,


873
0:55:26,1 --> 0:55:31,367
for example, NCR peptide #1, in a wild-type plant,


874
0:55:31,367 --> 0:55:35,267
gets processed to a smaller molecular weight.


875
0:55:35,267 --> 0:55:40,533
But unless the DNF1 peptidase is there, it does not get processed,


876
0:55:40,533 --> 0:55:44,433
because here's our mutant, and you can see that the protein,


877
0:55:44,433 --> 0:55:47,467
shown here in immunoblot, is larger.


878
0:55:47,467 --> 0:55:50,667
It's because its signal peptide was never taken off.


879
0:55:50,667 --> 0:55:54,333
They have also been able to show that, with antibodies,


880
0:55:54,333 --> 0:55:59,633
that in wild-type cells, if you use a green dye to indicate the bacteria


881
0:55:59,633 --> 0:56:5,5
and a red fluorescence for the antibody to the NCR peptide,


882
0:56:5,5 --> 0:56:6,833
they co-localize.


883
0:56:6,833 --> 0:56:12,567
Bacteria and NCR peptides co-localize in a normal wild-type cell.


884
0:56:12,567 --> 0:56:18,0
Here, they showed an example of what happens in a mutant dnf1 cell.


885
0:56:18,0 --> 0:56:23,67
You can see that the bacteria are all over the place in green,


886
0:56:23,67 --> 0:56:26,1
but that this NCR peptide,


887
0:56:26,1 --> 0:56:28,133
which we know is not being processed, right?


888
0:56:28,133 --> 0:56:29,733
Because it's large molecular weight?


889
0:56:29,733 --> 0:56:32,567
That NCR peptide is stuck someplace,


890
0:56:32,567 --> 0:56:34,833
probably in the endoplasmic reticulum.


891
0:56:34,833 --> 0:56:39,0
So, their conclusions, together with our work on the DNF1,


892
0:56:39,0 --> 0:56:43,567
are that the NCR peptides are substrates of the DNF1 complex.


893
0:56:43,567 --> 0:56:46,233
In wild type, these are delivered to the symbiosome,


894
0:56:46,233 --> 0:56:49,3
and in dnf1, they're retained in the ER.


895
0:56:49,3 --> 0:56:53,4
They've shown in other work that these mature NCR peptides


896
0:56:53,4 --> 0:56:55,667
have profound effects on bacteria,


897
0:56:55,667 --> 0:56:58,7
such as causing them to cease cell division


898
0:56:58,7 --> 0:57:1,767
and changing their membrane permeability,


899
0:57:1,767 --> 0:57:6,433
so that's an ongoing story about the activity of the NCRs.


900
0:57:6,433 --> 0:57:10,667
To complete the model so far, we might ask,


901
0:57:10,667 --> 0:57:12,367
what does DNF1 do,


902
0:57:12,367 --> 0:57:18,767
and one likely activity is that it processes NCR proteins.


903
0:57:18,767 --> 0:57:22,267
These end up in the lumen of the ER, and they are targeted,


904
0:57:22,267 --> 0:57:28,267
perhaps using SYP132 as part of the mechanism for targeting,


905
0:57:28,267 --> 0:57:33,7
into vesicles, which come over and fuse with the symbiosome,


906
0:57:33,7 --> 0:57:37,733
in which Rhizobium are going to be differentiating.


907
0:57:37,733 --> 0:57:42,567
Now, we also have questions about DNF1 beyond the NCR proteins.


908
0:57:42,567 --> 0:57:46,333
For example, DNF1 is present even in legume plants


909
0:57:46,333 --> 0:57:49,1
that do not have the NCR proteins.


910
0:57:49,1 --> 0:57:51,167
So what is it doing there?


911
0:57:51,167 --> 0:57:57,67
Another question is, in the dnf1 mutant,


912
0:57:57,67 --> 0:58:2,167
the bacteroids do not differentiate, but they also stop dividing,


913
0:58:2,167 --> 0:58:5,167
so it seems that even without DNF1,


914
0:58:5,167 --> 0:58:10,1
there may be other signals that are helping these bacteria


915
0:58:10,1 --> 0:58:13,967
to stop dividing. So we hope that we'll be able to work on those,


916
0:58:13,967 --> 0:58:17,233
as well as on the actual mechanism of DNF1


917
0:58:17,233 --> 0:58:20,0
in the next period of our work.


918
0:58:20,0 --> 0:58:24,833
I'd now like to finish by telling you about the other mutant, dnf2.


919
0:58:24,833 --> 0:58:27,9
And this, as you recall, as shown right there,


920
0:58:27,9 --> 0:58:31,0
that also had no nitrogen fixation.


921
0:58:31,0 --> 0:58:34,567
And we've done some work to characterize


922
0:58:34,567 --> 0:58:36,567
what's going on with dnf2


923
0:58:36,567 --> 0:58:38,9
and also to figure out what the gene is.


924
0:58:38,9 --> 0:58:41,767
Here is a picture in which you can see,


925
0:58:41,767 --> 0:58:46,567
from the root part to the distal part of the nodule,


926
0:58:46,567 --> 0:58:50,267
fluorescently labeled bacteria, and they are inside.


927
0:58:50,267 --> 0:58:56,833
We can tell that the bacteria get inside the dnf2 mutant nodules.


928
0:58:56,833 --> 0:59:0,1
However, they don't express nitrogenase,


929
0:59:0,1 --> 0:59:3,967
and they don't express many other bacterial genes either.


930
0:59:3,967 --> 0:59:8,567
So, somehow, DNF2 is again required for the bacteria


931
0:59:8,567 --> 0:59:13,8
to differentiate and, in fact, to express genes.


932
0:59:13,8 --> 0:59:18,467
Now we know that DNF2 is expressed only in nodules,


933
0:59:18,467 --> 0:59:21,267
even more strictly than DNF1.


934
0:59:21,267 --> 0:59:23,833
This shows you some promoter-GUS fusions


935
0:59:23,833 --> 0:59:29,767
where you can see that the early part of the nodule is expressing DNF2,


936
0:59:29,767 --> 0:59:31,5
and here you can see it at the tip,


937
0:59:31,5 --> 0:59:38,633
and then it diminishes just slightly as the nodules get somewhat older.


938
0:59:38,633 --> 0:59:41,33
What is DNF2?


939
0:59:41,33 --> 0:59:46,233
It appears to be similar to a phospholipase C,


940
0:59:46,233 --> 0:59:50,7
but it's not a canonical phospholipase C the way we're used to seeing.


941
0:59:50,7 --> 0:59:53,33
Here would be the classic PLC.


942
0:59:53,33 --> 0:59:59,967
You can see it's got the inositol trisphosphate binding, EF-hands,


943
0:59:59,967 --> 1:0:4,533
catalytic domains, calcium-binding domains, and so forth.


944
1:0:4,533 --> 1:0:9,433
The DNF2 is only homologous to


945
1:0:9,433 --> 1:0:15,1
one part of this large, complex phospholipase C.


946
1:0:15,1 --> 1:0:19,33
However, we do find that it is very, very similar


947
1:0:19,33 --> 1:0:23,9
to a phospholipase C whose model is shown here.


948
1:0:23,9 --> 1:0:27,33
This is actually a bacterial phospholipase C,


949
1:0:27,33 --> 1:0:31,7
and if you take this in red and then superpose DNF2,


950
1:0:31,7 --> 1:0:36,433
it does appear to be very, very similar in its 3D structure.


951
1:0:36,433 --> 1:0:39,7
So we want to know what's the biochemical activity;


952
1:0:39,7 --> 1:0:43,2
sequence alone doesn't tell us whether it really acts


953
1:0:43,2 --> 1:0:50,267
to process phospholipids or as a signaling.


954
1:0:50,267 --> 1:0:54,133
But we found one other thing that's really surprising to us.


955
1:0:54,133 --> 1:0:58,467
First, as I mentioned, it's only expressed in nodules,


956
1:0:58,467 --> 1:1:5,833
but secondly, it's not expressed in the cells of the plant that have Rhizobium.


957
1:1:5,833 --> 1:1:9,267
It's expressed in the noninfected cells of the nodule.


958
1:1:9,267 --> 1:1:11,867
And that's really a first.


959
1:1:11,867 --> 1:1:15,8
There are known metabolic enzymes in soybean, for example,


960
1:1:15,8 --> 1:1:18,133
that are present in uninfected cells.


961
1:1:18,133 --> 1:1:20,667
But there has never been found a regulator


962
1:1:20,667 --> 1:1:26,267
that appears to be active in the noninfected cells of the root nodule.


963
1:1:26,267 --> 1:1:29,667
So, what we're trying to ask ourselves is,


964
1:1:29,667 --> 1:1:33,7
does the DNF2 protein mediate the infection process


965
1:1:33,7 --> 1:1:36,67
directly or indirectly?


966
1:1:36,67 --> 1:1:40,267
Is it acting in some way that allows the noninfected cells


967
1:1:40,267 --> 1:1:43,833
to send signals or perhaps to avoid signals?


968
1:1:43,833 --> 1:1:47,7
So those are some of the questions that lie ahead for us.


969
1:1:47,7 --> 1:1:51,9
So winding up the combination of the studies that I've shown you today,


970
1:1:51,9 --> 1:1:54,933
I think that the future of our field is going to be very exciting


971
1:1:54,933 --> 1:1:58,1
as we take the results of the plant mutants and


972
1:1:58,1 --> 1:2:1,867
we study the proteins that are defined by those mutations,


973
1:2:1,867 --> 1:2:5,8
and look at how those work, both plant and bacteria together,


974
1:2:5,8 --> 1:2:8,8
not looking just at position, but looking at time.


975
1:2:8,8 --> 1:2:12,967
We're interested in the great questions of:


976
1:2:12,967 --> 1:2:14,5
What the signals are,


977
1:2:14,5 --> 1:2:16,633
and how the signals are transduced.


978
1:2:16,633 --> 1:2:20,633
Given that so much complicated cell biology has to happen


979
1:2:20,633 --> 1:2:25,67
between the beginning of the infection thread and the maturation of the symbiosome,


980
1:2:25,67 --> 1:2:27,333
we want to know not just the regulation,


981
1:2:27,333 --> 1:2:30,2
but what is the machinery of this infection,


982
1:2:30,2 --> 1:2:33,9
and we believe that both the proteins and molecular probes


983
1:2:33,9 --> 1:2:38,67
that we can obtain can be used to study the individual steps of


984
1:2:38,67 --> 1:2:41,133
nodulation as they move forward.


985
1:2:41,133 --> 1:4:41,133
So that concludes our journey through the plant side of symbiosis.
