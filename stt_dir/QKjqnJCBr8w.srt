1
0:0:0,12 --> 0:0:3,139
PROFESSOR: OKAY, SO I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
TO GET STARTED. SO


2
0:0:3,139 --> 0:0:8,4
YOU'LL RECALL LAST TIME WE STARTED TALKING
ABOUT SOME OF THE


3
0:0:8,4 --> 0:0:11,25
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLOWERING PLANTS AND OTHER
SEED PLANTS WE'D


4
0:0:11,25 --> 0:0:15,419
SEEN EARLIER THAT MIGHT AT LEAST IN PART BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR


5
0:0:15,419 --> 0:0:20,97
SUCCESS LIKE THE OVARY THAT PROTECTS THE OVULES
AND MECHANISMS


6
0:0:20,97 --> 0:0:24,96
PROMOTING OUTCROSSING. AND THEN I STARTED
TALKING ABOUT SOME OF


7
0:0:24,96 --> 0:0:29,48
THESE POLLINATION SYNDROMES THAT REFLECT ADAPTATION
WITH


8
0:0:29,48 --> 0:0:33,41
PARTICULAR GROUPS OF POLLINATORS. WE TALKED
ABOUT BEE


9
0:0:33,41 --> 0:0:37,96
POLLINATION, THE MOST IMPORTANT BIOTIC POLLINATION,
MOTHS,


10
0:0:37,96 --> 0:0:43,379
BUTTERFLIES, BIRDS AND BATS. AND I JUST WANT
TO WRAP THAT UP


11
0:0:43,379 --> 0:0:47,1
BEFORE GETTING INTO SOME OF THE INNOVATIONS
OF THE ANGIOSPERM


12
0:0:47,1 --> 0:0:51,46
LIFE CYCLE THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER
IN TERMS OF THE


13
0:0:51,46 --> 0:0:55,249
SUCCESS OF ANGIOSPERMS. AND THEN WE'LL TALK
ABOUT FRUITS AND


14
0:0:55,249 --> 0:1:0,719
SEED GERMINATION TO WRAP UP THIS OVERVIEW
OF DIVERSITY IN THE


15
0:1:0,719 --> 0:1:5,47
COURSE. AND THEN STARTING NEXT TIME WE'LL
BE GETTING MORE INTO


16
0:1:5,47 --> 0:1:10,44
THE ANATOMY AND STRUCTURE OF PLANTS AND HOW
THAT AFFECTS THEIR


17
0:1:10,44 --> 0:1:15,43
ABILITY TO GROW AND TRANSPORT NUTRIENTS AND
WATER ET CETERA. SO


18
0:1:15,43 --> 0:1:19,12
SOME REALLY DIFFERENT TYPES OF ADAPTATIONS
IN THINGS YOU'VE SEEN


19
0:1:19,12 --> 0:1:26,42
IN ANIMALS. ALL RIGHT, SO I JUST BRIEFLY TALKED
ABOUT FLY


20
0:1:26,42 --> 0:1:29,86
POLLINATION AT THE END OF LAST LECTURE AS
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF


21
0:1:29,86 --> 0:1:34,32
DECEIT POLLINATION. REMEMBER IN POLLINATION,
IT'S OFTEN A


22
0:1:34,32 --> 0:1:38,67
MUTUALISM WHERE THE PLANT OFFERS A REWARD
TO THE POLLINATOR THAT


23
0:1:38,67 --> 0:1:45,49
BENEFITS IN SOME TANGIBLE WAY, OFTEN GENERALLY
FOOD. THE PLANT,


24
0:1:45,49 --> 0:1:49,8
OF COURSE, BENEFITS BY BEING POLLINATED. BUT
IN FLY POLLINATION


25
0:1:49,8 --> 0:1:49,8



26
0:1:49,8 --> 0:1:53,56
LIKE IN THOSE BEE ORCHIDS, THE POLLINATOR
LOSES, BUT IT'S STILL


27
0:1:53,56 --> 0:2:0,13
EFFECTIVE. THE FLY POLLINATION SYNDROME IS
ASSOCIATED WITH


28
0:2:0,13 --> 0:2:4,85
REDDISH OR MAROON-COLORED INFLORESCENCES OR
FLOWERS THAT AS I


29
0:2:4,85 --> 0:2:8,159
MENTIONED ARE LIGHT-SPOTTED WHICH SORT OF
RESEMBLES MAGGOTS


30
0:2:8,159 --> 0:2:13,39
GROWING ON ROTTING MEAT. AND THEY OFTEN HAVE
A FLESHY TEXTURE,


31
0:2:13,39 --> 0:2:16,749
I MEAN A DEFINITE FLESHY TEXTURE COMPARED
TO MOST FLOWERS THAT


32
0:2:16,749 --> 0:2:20,89
CAN FOOL FLIES INTO THINKING THEY'RE WALKING
AROUND ON ROTTING


33
0:2:20,89 --> 0:2:26,249
MEAT AND IN THE PROCESS POLLINATE THE PLANTS.
AND THE FLOWER,


34
0:2:26,249 --> 0:2:30,739
THE FLORAL SCENTS ARE INCREDIBLY SIMILAR TO
CADAVERS, WHICH HAS


35
0:2:30,739 --> 0:2:33,489
LEAD TO A LOT OF THESE PLANTS, FLOWERS BEING
CALLED CORPSE


36
0:2:33,489 --> 0:2:37,469
FLOWERS WHICH BOTH OF THESE ARE, EVEN THOUGH
THIS IS AN


37
0:2:37,469 --> 0:2:42,26
INFLORESCENCE, NOT A, NOT AN INDIVIDUAL FLOWER.
AND SO THE


38
0:2:42,26 --> 0:2:46,889
FLIES, THE FEMALE FLIES VISIT THESE, THESE
FLOWERS AND LAY THEIR


39
0:2:46,889 --> 0:2:51,469
EGGS. AND THEN THE EGGS HATCH AND THE MAGGOTS
DIE. THEY STARVE


40
0:2:51,469 --> 0:2:54,569
TO DEATH BECAUSE THERE'S NO FOOD HERE FOR
THEM. SO THIS IS REAL


41
0:2:54,569 --> 0:2:57,98
DECEIT POLLINATION. BUT FORTUNATELY FOR THE
PLANTS AND THE


42
0:2:57,98 --> 0:3:1,969
FLIES, THERE ARE A LOT OF FLIES TO GO AROUND,
SO THERE'S NO LOSS


43
0:3:1,969 --> 0:3:6,629
OF THE POLLINATOR THROUGH TIME. AND ONE OF
THE NEAT THINGS


44
0:3:6,629 --> 0:3:9,98
ABOUT FLY POLLINATION IS IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH
SOME OF THESE


45
0:3:9,98 --> 0:3:14,959
ABSOLUTELY HUGE INFLORESCENCES AND FLOWERS.
AND I MENTIONED


46
0:3:14,959 --> 0:3:19,959
LAST TIME THE TITAN ARUM WHICH IS ACTUALLY
IN CULTIVATION UP AT


47
0:3:19,959 --> 0:3:24,409
THE U.C. BOTANICAL GARDEN. AND WHEN IT FLOWERS,
IT'S ADVERTISED


48
0:3:24,409 --> 0:3:29,609
ON THE BERKELEY HOME PAGE AND DEFINITELY WORTH
CHECKING OUT. IT


49
0:3:29,609 --> 0:3:34,409
GETS UP TO 10 FEET TALL, THE INFLORESCENCE,
AN IMMENSE THING.


50
0:3:34,409 --> 0:3:39,159
IT'S NATIVE TO THE FORESTS, RAIN FORESTS OF
INDONESIA, WHICH


51
0:3:39,159 --> 0:3:39,159



52
0:3:39,159 --> 0:3:43,249
HAPPENS TO BE WHERE YOU ALSO FIND THIS PLANT
WHICH IS DISTANTLY


53
0:3:43,249 --> 0:3:46,65
RELATED. IT'S A CASE OF CONVERGENT EVOLUTION
ON FLY


54
0:3:46,65 --> 0:3:50,829
POLLINATION. IT'S CALLED, THE NAME IS RAFFLESIA
ARNOLDII. THE


55
0:3:50,829 --> 0:3:55,62
NAME'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT AT ALL. BUT IT'S
A INDIVIDUAL FLOWER,


56
0:3:55,62 --> 0:3:59,599
AND IT'S THE LARGEST FLOWER KNOWN ON EARTH.
IT GETS UP TO ABOUT


57
0:3:59,599 --> 0:4:5,469
A METER IN DIAMETER. AND IT, IT WEIGHS, IT
WEIGHS IN AT OVER


58
0:4:5,469 --> 0:4:10,969
20 POUNDS, SO IT'S A HUGE FLOWER. AND IT'S
NOT ONLY A, IT'S NOT


59
0:4:10,969 --> 0:4:14,99
ONLY CHEATING FLIES IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING
POLLINATED BUT IT'S


60
0:4:14,99 --> 0:4:18,629
ALSO PARASITIZING ANOTHER FLOWERING PLANT
FOR ALL OF ITS


61
0:4:18,629 --> 0:4:22,65
NUTRIENTS. THIS THING IS A HOLOPARASITE. IT
HAS NO STEMS,


62
0:4:22,65 --> 0:4:26,979
LEAVES, TRUE ROOTS. IT'S JUST GROWING INSIDE
THE TISSUES OF A


63
0:4:26,979 --> 0:4:30,419
MEMBER OF THE GRAPE FAMILY. SO YOU CAN'T EVEN
TELL IT'S THERE


64
0:4:30,419 --> 0:4:34,6
UNTIL IT FLOWERS AND THIS GIGANTIC FLOWER
EMERGES. IT'S PRETTY


65
0:4:34,6 --> 0:4:43,759
BIZARRE. OKAY, SO WIND POLLINATION ALSO OCCURS
IN ANGIOSPERMS,


66
0:4:43,759 --> 0:4:46,19
AND REMEMBER THIS IS THE DOMINANT TYPE OF
POLLINATION IN


67
0:4:46,19 --> 0:4:52,96
GYMNOSPERMS EXCEPT FOR CYCADS. AND IT'S SECONDARILY
EVOLVED WE


68
0:4:52,96 --> 0:4:58,27
KNOW NOW FROM INSECT POLLINATION OR ANIMAL
POLLINATION. IT


69
0:4:58,27 --> 0:5:0,949
OCCURS IN ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF ALL FLOWERING
PLANTS, SO NOT AN


70
0:5:0,949 --> 0:5:4,979
INSIGNIFICANT NUMBER, GIVEN THAT THERE ARE
LIKE 300,000 FLOWERING


71
0:5:4,979 --> 0:5:9,169
PLANTS. AND IT USED TO BE THOUGHT THAT THESE
WIND-POLLINATED


72
0:5:9,169 --> 0:5:14,78
FLOWERING PLANTS MOSTLY CONSTITUTED A SINGLE
GROUP, A NATURAL


73
0:5:14,78 --> 0:5:18,169
GROUP. BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT TRUE. THINGS
LIKE OAKS,


74
0:5:18,169 --> 0:5:23,83
BIRCHES, BEECHES, HAZELNUTS SHOWN HERE ARE
NOT CLOSELY RELATED TO


75
0:5:23,83 --> 0:5:28,699
THINGS LIKE MULBERRIES AND STINGING NETTLES
AND MARIJUANA WHICH


76
0:5:28,699 --> 0:5:31,919
ARE A SEPARATE ORIGIN OF WIND POLLINATION.
AND THERE ARE SOME


77
0:5:31,919 --> 0:5:31,919



78
0:5:31,919 --> 0:5:37,22
OTHER EXAMPLES TOO. BUT THEY'VE ALL EVOLVED,
OR NOT ALL, NOT


79
0:5:37,22 --> 0:5:40,199
EVERY CASE, BUT THERE'S A SUITE OF FEATURES
THAT THEY'VE


80
0:5:40,199 --> 0:5:45,569
CONVERGED ON EVOLUTIONARILY THAT MAKE THEM
APPEAR VERY SIMILAR.


81
0:5:45,569 --> 0:5:48,58
SO IT'S A REALLY GREAT CASE WHERE WE HAVE
MULTIPLE ORIGINS OF A


82
0:5:48,58 --> 0:5:52,44
TYPE OF POLLINATION WHERE A WHOLE SUITE OF
FEATURES COMES ALONG


83
0:5:52,44 --> 0:5:55,909
WITH THAT THAT PRETTY CLEARLY ARE IMPORTANT
ADAPTATIONS TO THAT


84
0:5:55,909 --> 0:6:0,83
TYPE OF POLLINATION. SO ONE THING IS THAT
THE FLOWERS ARE


85
0:6:0,83 --> 0:6:5,75
EITHER PISTILLATE OR STAMINATE BUT NOT BOTH.
SO THAT HAS SOME


86
0:6:5,75 --> 0:6:11,12
OBVIOUS ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF PREVENTING
SELF-POLLINATION. AND


87
0:6:11,12 --> 0:6:14,2
OFTEN THE PISTILLATE AND STAMINATE FLOWERS
ARE BORNE IN SEPARATE


88
0:6:14,2 --> 0:6:18,379
INFLORESCENCES, SOMETIMES ON SEPARATE PLANTS,
ALSO PROMOTING


89
0:6:18,379 --> 0:6:24,36
OUTCROSSING. AND THE PETALS NOT SURPRISINGLY
ARE REALLY SMALL


90
0:6:24,36 --> 0:6:28,12
OR ALL TOGETHER ABSENT. AND THAT MAKES SENSE
BOTH IN TERMS OF


91
0:6:28,12 --> 0:6:32,59
INVESTMENT, WHY INVEST IN A BIG ATTRACTIVE
SET OF DISPLAY


92
0:6:32,59 --> 0:6:35,639
FEATURES WHEN YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO ATTRACT
AN ANIMAL POLLINATOR


93
0:6:35,639 --> 0:6:39,939
ANYMORE, BUT ALSO IT'S A REAL DISADVANTAGE
TO HAVE BIG SHOWY


94
0:6:39,939 --> 0:6:42,479
PETALS IF YOU'RE WIND-POLLINATED BECAUSE THEY'RE
JUST GOING TO


95
0:6:42,479 --> 0:6:47,43
GET IN THE WAY OF THE POLLEN BEING DISPERSED
AND RECEIVED. SO


96
0:6:47,43 --> 0:6:50,59
IT'S TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PLANT TO NOT
HAVE THESE INERT


97
0:6:50,59 --> 0:6:55,69
SURFACES AROUND THAT CAN BLOCK POLLEN. AND
THAT ALSO THE CASE


98
0:6:55,69 --> 0:6:59,43
ABOUT THEIR FLOWERING TIME. SO IN MANY CASES,
NOT ALL CASES BUT


99
0:6:59,43 --> 0:7:3,919
IN MANY CASES, ESPECIALLY, WELL, WHEN WE HAVE
DECIDUOUS TAXA


100
0:7:3,919 --> 0:7:7,55
INVOLVED, WHICH MANY OF THESE ARE, A LOT OF
OUR HARDWOODS FALL


101
0:7:7,55 --> 0:7:12,199
INTO THIS CATEGORY, WIND POLLINATION THAT
ARE WINTER DECIDUOUS,


102
0:7:12,199 --> 0:7:16,419
THEY'LL FLOWER BEFORE THE, THE LEAVES EXPAND
IN THE SPRINGTIME.


103
0:7:16,419 --> 0:7:17,159



104
0:7:17,159 --> 0:7:21,58
AND THAT'S AN ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF MINIMIZING
BLOCKAGE OF POLLEN


105
0:7:21,58 --> 0:7:26,21
BY THESE INERT SURFACES. AND ALSO THE ANTHERS
LIKE IN A LOT OF


106
0:7:26,21 --> 0:7:30,55
CASES WHERE WE HAVE DISPERSAL FROM SPORANGIA
AS WELL AS


107
0:7:30,55 --> 0:7:35,389
MICROSPORANGIA AND GYNOSPERMS, THE ANTHERS
OPEN IN DRY WEATHER


108
0:7:35,389 --> 0:7:41,349
WHICH PROMOTES DISPERSAL OF POLLEN. AND THEY
TEND TO HAVE


109
0:7:41,349 --> 0:7:44,96
ENLARGED STIGMATIC SURFACES. THIS IS REALLY
COMMON LIKE IN


110
0:7:44,96 --> 0:7:47,43
GRASSES AND OTHER GROUPS WHERE YOU GET THESE
FEATHERY LOOKING


111
0:7:47,43 --> 0:7:52,49
STIGMAS THAT MAXIMIZE SURFACE AREA TO CAPTURE
POLLEN. SO THAT'S


112
0:7:52,49 --> 0:7:55,62
A, A COMMON FEATURE. AND ALSO WHEN YOU LOOK
AT THE POLLEN


113
0:7:55,62 --> 0:8:0,2
ITSELF, IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE INSECT
POLLINAT- OR


114
0:8:0,2 --> 0:8:5,539
ANIMAL-POLLINATED FLOWERS WHERE THE POLLEN
IS IN CLUMPS AND IT'S


115
0:8:5,539 --> 0:8:10,689
STICKY OR OILY AND ORNAMENTED. HERE YOU CAN
SEE IT'S DRY AND


116
0:8:10,689 --> 0:8:16,77
IT'S SMOOTH-WALLED. IT'S DISPERSED IN SINGLE
GRAINS, WHICH


117
0:8:16,77 --> 0:8:21,169
MAXIMIZES BOUNCY IN THE AIR. SO THERE'S A
LOT OF THESE GREAT


118
0:8:21,169 --> 0:8:26,949
FEATURES THAT WIND-POLLINATED PLANTS HAVE
EVOLVED. AND, AND


119
0:8:26,949 --> 0:8:29,749
THEY, THEY'RE REALLY, THEY CAN GET THEIR POLLEN
AROUND REALLY


120
0:8:29,749 --> 0:8:33,349
WELL. SOME WIND-POLLINATED PLANTS CAN DISPERSE
POLLEN OVER


121
0:8:33,349 --> 0:8:38,6
LARGE DISTANCES AND TO THE MISFORTUNE TO A
LOT OF US THAT HAVE


122
0:8:38,6 --> 0:8:43,389
HAYFEVER, POLLEN ALLERGIES. AND THERE'S ALSO
EVEN WATER


123
0:8:43,389 --> 0:8:46,2
POLLINATION. THIS IS REALLY RARE, BUT THERE
ARE SOME


124
0:8:46,2 --> 0:8:51,93
ANGIOSPERMS THAT HAVE GONE BACK TO AN AQUATIC
ENVIRONMENT.


125
0:8:51,93 --> 0:8:55,6
ANCESTRALLY THESE WERE LAND PLANTS. BUT SOME
ANGIOSPERMS HAVE


126
0:8:55,6 --> 0:9:1,35
BECOME AQUATIC, BOTH IN FRESH WATER AND IN
MARINE SITUATIONS.


127
0:9:1,35 --> 0:9:4,92
AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM, VALLISNERIA WHICH
IS THE RIBBON WEED.


128
0:9:4,92 --> 0:9:7,41
AND THESE, SOME OF THESE HAVE, THEY HAVE A
WHOLE, THERE'S A BUNCH


129
0:9:7,41 --> 0:9:7,41



130
0:9:7,41 --> 0:9:11,72
OF DIFFERENT ADAPTATIONS TO POLLINATION IN
THESE DIFFERENT GROUPS


131
0:9:11,72 --> 0:9:15,43
OF PLANTS THAT HAVE GONE BACK TO WATER. BUT
IN VALLISNERIA YOU


132
0:9:15,43 --> 0:9:18,87
HAVE THE RELEASE OF THE MALE FLOWERS. IT ACTUALLY
JUST POPS THE


133
0:9:18,87 --> 0:9:22,91
MALE FLOWERS OFF OF THE PEDESTAL AND THEY
FLOAT UP TO THE TOP.


134
0:9:22,91 --> 0:9:26,35
AND THEY FLOAT AROUND ON THE SURFACE. THE
FEMALE FLOWERS ARE


135
0:9:26,35 --> 0:9:30,43
HELD WITH SOME TENSION SO THAT THERE'S, THERE'S
ACTUALLY A


136
0:9:30,43 --> 0:9:34,75
DEPRESSION IN THE WATER SURFACE, AND THE MALE
FLOWERS FLOATING


137
0:9:34,75 --> 0:9:37,81
AROUND WILL BE DRAWN INTO THE DEPRESSION IN
THE WATER SURFACE AND


138
0:9:37,81 --> 0:9:40,63
POLLINATE THE FEMALE FLOWER OR THE, I SHOULD
SAY THE PISTILLATE


139
0:9:40,63 --> 0:9:47,16
FLOWERS. SO IN THE EELGRASSES WHICH, I SHOULD
SAY RIBBON


140
0:9:47,16 --> 0:9:51,529
GRASSES ARE NOT REALLY GRASSES. THEY ARE MONOCOTS
JUST IN CASE


141
0:9:51,529 --> 0:9:54,709
YOU'RE INTERESTED. EELGRASSES, WHICH YOU CAN
SEE OUT IN


142
0:9:54,709 --> 0:9:58,87
ESTUARIES ALONG THE COAST HERE AND EVEN OUT
IN THE OPEN OCEAN,


143
0:9:58,87 --> 0:10:3,4
ARE OUR ONLY LOCAL GROUP OF MARINE ANGIOSPERMS.
AND THEY'RE


144
0:10:3,4 --> 0:10:7,75
ALSO NOT REALLY GRASSES, BUT THEY ARE MONOCOTS.
AND THEY


145
0:10:7,75 --> 0:10:11,32
ACTUALLY RELEASE THEIR POLLEN UNDER WATER.
POLLEN IS USUALLY


146
0:10:11,32 --> 0:10:14,269
REALLY VULNERABLE TO WETTING. IF POLLEN GETS
WET, IT'S USUALLY


147
0:10:14,269 --> 0:10:18,85
CURTAINS. BUT IN THE CASE OF RIBBON, I SHOULD,
EELGRASSES THEY


148
0:10:18,85 --> 0:10:23,23
CAN WITHSTAND EMERGING IN SALTWATER. AND THIS
THREAD-LIKE POLLEN


149
0:10:23,23 --> 0:10:27,43
THAT IS CARRIED AROUND IN THE CURRENTS WILL
WRAP AROUND THE


150
0:10:27,43 --> 0:10:31,8
STIGMA WHEN IT COMES INTO CONTACT AND GERMINATE
IT. SO THERE'S


151
0:10:31,8 --> 0:10:35,23
A BUNCH OF REALLY AMAZING ADAPTATIONS OF FLOWERING
PLANTS TO


152
0:10:35,23 --> 0:10:41,699
POLLINATION, SPECIALIZATIONS INVOLVING BOTH
ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC


153
0:10:41,699 --> 0:10:47,94
AGENTS. OKAY, SO ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT POLLINATION?
BEFORE WE


154
0:10:47,94 --> 0:10:53,31
MOVE ON? ALL RIGHT, SO I JUST WANT TO TALK
BRIEFLY ABOUT SOME,


155
0:10:53,31 --> 0:10:53,31



156
0:10:53,31 --> 0:10:59,839
SOME EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS THAT WE SEE IN FLOWERING
PLANT FLOWER


157
0:10:59,839 --> 0:11:5,23
EVOLUTION. THERE IS A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT
COME UP REPEATEDLY


158
0:11:5,23 --> 0:11:10,339
ACROSS FLOWERING PLANTS. ONE OF THEM IS THE
LOSS OR REDUCTION


159
0:11:10,339 --> 0:11:14,519
IN NUMBER OF FLORAL PARTS. SO WE LOOK AT SOME
OF THESE


160
0:11:14,519 --> 0:11:17,47
FLOWERING PLANTS THAT RECONSTRUCT AS HAVING
FAIRLY ANCESTRAL


161
0:11:17,47 --> 0:11:21,89
FLOWERS, THEY USUALLY HAVE A LARGE AND INDEFINITE
NUMBER OF PARTS


162
0:11:21,89 --> 0:11:26,38
OF THE DIFFERENT FLORALS OR DIFFERENT GROUPS
OF PERIANTHER,


163
0:11:26,38 --> 0:11:29,75
SEPALS, PETALS, STAMENS, AND CARPELS. AND
WE TEND TO SEE A


164
0:11:29,75 --> 0:11:33,19
GENERAL REDUCTION THROUGH TIME. THIS IS A
RED MAPLE WHERE IT'S


165
0:11:33,19 --> 0:11:38,86
LOST THE PISTILS, FUNCTIONAL PISTILS IN THESE
PARTICULAR FLOWERS.


166
0:11:38,86 --> 0:11:42,48
THERE ARE SOME PLANT, FLOWERS ON THESE PLANTS
THAT CAN BE


167
0:11:42,48 --> 0:11:46,399
BISEXUAL. AND THEY READILY SELF. BUT WE SEE,
THIS IS A


168
0:11:46,399 --> 0:11:50,889
PARTICULAR SPECIES WHERE WE SEE A TREND TOWARD
DIOECY OCCURRING


169
0:11:50,889 --> 0:11:55,829
DURING THIS SNAPSHOT IN TIME. SO IT'S KIND
OF AN INTERESTING


170
0:11:55,829 --> 0:11:59,829
SPECIES IN THAT REGARD. ALSO I MENTIONED IN
WIND-POLLINATED


171
0:11:59,829 --> 0:12:3,829
PLANTS YOU CAN HAVE LOSS OF THE PETALS ALL
TOGETHER. THERE ARE


172
0:12:3,829 --> 0:12:7,1
VARIOUS SPECIALIZATIONS THAT HAVE RESULTED
IN LOSS OF FLORAL


173
0:12:7,1 --> 0:12:10,38
PARTS. AND IT'S RARE THAT WE SEE AN AMPLIFICATION
IN NUMBER OF


174
0:12:10,38 --> 0:12:16,19
FLORAL PARTS ALTHOUGH IT CAN HAPPEN. ANOTHER
THING THAT WE SEE


175
0:12:16,19 --> 0:12:22,94
IS FUSION OF PARTS OF BOTH THE SAME TYPE,
LIKE PETALS TO PETALS


176
0:12:22,94 --> 0:12:26,55
IN THE CASE OF THIS FOXGLOVE HERE WHERE ALL
THE PETALS ARE FUSED


177
0:12:26,55 --> 0:12:31,6
TOGETHER INTO THIS TUBULAR COROLLA. THAT'S
A COMMON THING. WE


178
0:12:31,6 --> 0:12:35,17
CAN ALSO GET FUSION OF UNLIKE PARTS. FOR EXAMPLE,
STAMENS FUSE


179
0:12:35,17 --> 0:12:39,13
TO THE INSIDE OF PETALS. AND THAT'S WHAT'S
GOING ON INSIDE THE


180
0:12:39,13 --> 0:12:43,139
FLOWER HERE. YOU CAN'T SEE IT. BUT THAT SORT
OF FUSION OF LIKE


181
0:12:43,139 --> 0:12:43,139



182
0:12:43,139 --> 0:12:48,37
PARTS AND UNLIKE PARTS CAN HELP TO INTEGRATE
THE FLOWER IN A WAY


183
0:12:48,37 --> 0:12:53,54
THAT IT FUNCTIONS AS A WHOLE VERY EFFECTIVELY
DURING POLLINATION


184
0:12:53,54 --> 0:12:57,449
AND CAN ALLOW FOR MORE PRECISE, ACCURATE PLACEMENT
OF POLLEN ON A


185
0:12:57,449 --> 0:13:0,82
POLLINATOR. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, A POLLINATOR
LANDS ON THE THROAT OF


186
0:13:0,82 --> 0:13:5,399
THIS FLOWER AND DEPRESSES THAT LOWER LIP AND
THAT'S GOING TO


187
0:13:5,399 --> 0:13:9,23
CAUSE THE STAMENS ABOVE TO COME DOWN ON TOP
OF THE BACK OF THE


188
0:13:9,23 --> 0:13:12,98
POLLINATOR AND DEPOSIT POLLEN OR THE STIGMA
TO COME DOWN AND PICK


189
0:13:12,98 --> 0:13:17,199
UP POLLEN. THOUGH THAT CAN GO HAND-IN-HAND
WITH REDUCTION IN


190
0:13:17,199 --> 0:13:21,23
NUMBER OF PARTS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE MORE ACCURACY
AND PRECISION


191
0:13:21,23 --> 0:13:24,269
IN YOUR POLLEN PLACEMENT AND POLLEN REMOVAL,
YOU DON'T NEED


192
0:13:24,269 --> 0:13:29,29
NECESSARILY, FOR EXAMPLE, AS MANY STAMENS.
THAT'S SO THESE


193
0:13:29,29 --> 0:13:36,79
KINDS, THESE TRAITS, THESE TRENDS CAN GO TOGETHER
IN SOME CASES.


194
0:13:36,79 --> 0:13:40,74
ANOTHER TREND THAT WE SEE IS A SHIFT FROM
RADIAL SYMMETRY WHERE


195
0:13:40,74 --> 0:13:47,24
WE HAVE BASICALLY LIKE A PIE WHERE YOU CAN
CUT IT IN ANY, IN ANY


196
0:13:47,24 --> 0:13:52,89
DIRECTION AND GET TWO EQUAL HALVES, RADIAL
SYMMETRY, AS OPPOSED


197
0:13:52,89 --> 0:13:55,13
TO BILATERAL SYMMETRY LIKE US WHERE YOU CAN
ONLY CUT US IN HALF


198
0:13:55,13 --> 0:13:58,97
IN ONE PLANE AND GET TWO EQUAL HALVES. AND
THAT'S WHAT WE SEE


199
0:13:58,97 --> 0:14:2,66
IN THIS FOXGLOVE AS WELL AS IN THIS ORCHID
WHERE THAT'S THE ONLY


200
0:14:2,66 --> 0:14:8,279
PLANE IN WHICH WE COULD CUT THIS FLOWER AND
GET TWO EQUAL HALVES.


201
0:14:8,279 --> 0:14:13,99
AND WE GET THIS BILATERAL SYMMETRY EVOLVING
IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT


202
0:14:13,99 --> 0:14:17,61
GROUPS, THE FLOWERING PLANTS, AND IT OFTEN
GOES ALONG REALLY WELL


203
0:14:17,61 --> 0:14:22,81
WITH SPECIALIZATION IN POLLINATOR, IN POLLINATION
WITH PARTICULAR


204
0:14:22,81 --> 0:14:28,399
POLLINATORS. SO IT ALSO PROMOTES PRECISION
AND ACCURACY OF


205
0:14:28,399 --> 0:14:32,5
POLLEN PLACEMENT. IN THE CASE OF ORCHIDS,
MOST ORCHIDS ONLY


206
0:14:32,5 --> 0:14:36,399
HAVE A SINGLE STAMEN. SO THEY'VE GONE DOWN
TO A SINGLE STAMEN,


207
0:14:36,399 --> 0:14:37,99



208
0:14:37,99 --> 0:14:41,3
AND THEY TRANSFER ALL THEIR POLLEN AT ONCE
WITH THAT SINGLE


209
0:14:41,3 --> 0:14:45,779
STAMEN. THOUGH THERE'S, THAT'S A REPEATED
TREND AND THESE


210
0:14:45,779 --> 0:14:50,66
GROUPS THAT SHOW BILATERAL SYMMETRY OF FLOWERS
HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY


211
0:14:50,66 --> 0:14:54,8
HIGHER DIVERSITY THAN GROUPS THAT DON'T. THAT'S
BEEN SHOWN IN A


212
0:14:54,8 --> 0:14:57,18
NUMBER, THERE'S ENOUGH DIFFERENT PLANT FAMILIES
WHERE THAT'S


213
0:14:57,18 --> 0:15:1,829
EVOLVED THAT IT'S BEEN, WE CAN DO COMPARATIVE
STUDIES AND MAKE A


214
0:15:1,829 --> 0:15:5,319
RIGOROUS CASE FOR AN INCREASED DIVERSITY WHEN
YOU EVOLVE THIS


215
0:15:5,319 --> 0:15:12,17
KIND OF SPECIALIZATION. AND ANOTHER TREND
THAT WE SEE HAPPENING


216
0:15:12,17 --> 0:15:17,25
OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS ADDITIONAL PROTECTION
OF THE OVARY, OF THE


217
0:15:17,25 --> 0:15:20,86
OVULES. AND REMEMBER THE OVULES ARE ALREADY
CONTAINED WITHIN AN


218
0:15:20,86 --> 0:15:24,769
OVARY IN FLOWERING PLANTS UNLIKE IN GYMNOSPERMS
WHICH PROVIDE


219
0:15:24,769 --> 0:15:31,339
SOME PROTECTION FROM HERBIVORES, FROM DRYING
OUT IN THE, WITH


220
0:15:31,339 --> 0:15:36,129
REGARD TO ABIOTIC FACTORS, ET CETERA. AND
IN SOME FLOWERING


221
0:15:36,129 --> 0:15:41,69
PLANTS, OTHER FLORAL WHORLS LIKE THE PERIANTH,
THE, THE PETALS


222
0:15:41,69 --> 0:15:46,279
AND SEPALS, THE BASES OF THE STAMENS CAN FORM
A FLORAL TUBE THAT


223
0:15:46,279 --> 0:15:51,5
FUSES AROUND THE OVARY OR THE OVARY CAN ACTUALLY
BECOME EMBEDDED


224
0:15:51,5 --> 0:15:55,35
IN THE TIP OF THE STEM LIKE IN A CACTUS HERE.
AND WE CAN HAVE


225
0:15:55,35 --> 0:16:0,129
TISSUE IN ADDITION TO THE OVARY FUSED AROUND
AND PROTECTING THE


226
0:16:0,129 --> 0:16:3,42
OVULES. SO THE OVARY IS WHAT WE CALL INFERIOR
IN THIS CASE


227
0:16:3,42 --> 0:16:8,29
BECAUSE IT'S LOOKS LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY DEPRESSED
DOWN INTO THE


228
0:16:8,29 --> 0:16:11,86
STEM WHICH IT ACTUALLY IS IN CACTI, BUT IN
MOST PLANTS THAT HAVE


229
0:16:11,86 --> 0:16:14,899
AN INFERIOR OVARY, IT'S THE OTHER OUTSIDE
PARTS OF THE FLOWER


230
0:16:14,899 --> 0:16:18,399
THAT FUSE AROUND THE OVARY. BUT THOSE ARE
JUST DETAILS. BUT


231
0:16:18,399 --> 0:16:23,25
THE MAIN POINT IS THAT THERE'S OTHER TISSUE
IN ADDITION TO OVARY


232
0:16:23,25 --> 0:16:26,889
TISSUE THAT SURROUNDS THE, THE OVULES THAT'S
FUSED TO THE


233
0:16:26,889 --> 0:16:26,889



234
0:16:26,889 --> 0:16:32,43
OVARIES, TO THE OVARY. AND YOU ONLY GET A
SINGLE OVARY IN CASES


235
0:16:32,43 --> 0:16:38,55
LIKE THAT. OKAY, SO NOW THE LIFE CYCLE OF
ANGIOSPERMS IS PRETTY


236
0:16:38,55 --> 0:16:41,449
SIMILAR TO THE GYMNSPERMS, THE OTHER SEED
PLANTS, BUT THERE'S


237
0:16:41,449 --> 0:16:45,94
SOME REALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES THAT MAKE
A LOT OF SENSE IN


238
0:16:45,94 --> 0:16:51,199
TERMS OF HOW THESE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL
TO SUCCESS OF


239
0:16:51,199 --> 0:16:57,129
ANGIOSPERMS. SO LET'S LOOK AT THE POLLEN DEVELOPMENT
FIRST.


240
0:16:57,129 --> 0:17:2,41
AND THIS IS A DIAGRAM FROM YOUR TEXTBOOK.
AND JUST LIKE IN THE


241
0:17:2,41 --> 0:17:6,699
GYMNOSPERMS WE HAVE THE MICROSPOROGENESIS.
WE HAVE MICROSPORES


242
0:17:6,699 --> 0:17:13,62
FORMED IN MICROSPORANGIA WHICH, THROUGH MEIOSIS.
THIS IS, THESE


243
0:17:13,62 --> 0:17:18,959
ARE POLLEN SACS AS WE CALL THEM, BUT THEY'RE
MICROSPORANGIA.


244
0:17:18,959 --> 0:17:24,4
AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THE FOUR PRODUCTS OF
MEIOSIS. AND THE MALE


245
0:17:24,4 --> 0:17:27,25
GAMETOPHYTE THEN, OF COURSE THE MICROSPORE
GERMINATES, UNDERGOES


246
0:17:27,25 --> 0:17:33,99
MITOTIC DIVISIONS, ALREADY HAPLOID LIKE ANY
OTHER SPORE. AND


247
0:17:33,99 --> 0:17:39,35
THE GAMETOPHYTE'S HAPLOID. BUT AT THE TIME
OF DISPERSAL THE MALE


248
0:17:39,35 --> 0:17:43,52
GAMETOPHYTE USUALLY CONSISTS OF ONLY TWO CELLS,
A TUBE CELL THAT


249
0:17:43,52 --> 0:17:48,789
WILL DIRECT THE GROWTH OF THE POLLEN TUBE
AND A GENERATIVE CELL


250
0:17:48,789 --> 0:17:53,53
THAT WILL UNDERGO ANOTHER MITOTIC DIVISION
TO PRODUCE TWO SPERM


251
0:17:53,53 --> 0:17:57,5
CELLS. THOUGH THIS IS THE BEAR MINIMUM NUMBER
OF CELLS THAT


252
0:17:57,5 --> 0:18:2,36
THIS MALE GAMETOPHYTE NEEDS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY.
IT HAS TO HAVE


253
0:18:2,36 --> 0:18:5,24
A TUBE CELL IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THE POLLEN
TUBE TO GROW DOWN


254
0:18:5,24 --> 0:18:10,48
THROUGH THE STYLE AND REACH THE OVULES IN
THE OVARY. AND IT


255
0:18:10,48 --> 0:18:15,32
NEEDS BOTH OF THOSE SPERM CELLS, OKAY, UNLIKE
IN THE GYMNOSPERMS


256
0:18:15,32 --> 0:18:19,11
THAT ONLY NEED ONE OF THEIR SPERM CELLS, ANGIOSPERMS
NEED BOTH OF


257
0:18:19,11 --> 0:18:22,309
THE SPERM CELLS OF THE MALE GAMETOPHYTE. WE'LL
GET INTO THAT IN


258
0:18:22,309 --> 0:18:25,76
A MINUTE. THAT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT INNOVATION
WE'LL GET TO.


259
0:18:25,76 --> 0:18:28,59



260
0:18:28,59 --> 0:18:31,45
OKAY, BUT FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FEMALE
GAMETOPHYTE.


261
0:18:31,45 --> 0:18:34,789
REMEMBER IN THE GYMNOSPERMS THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE
IS A FAIRLY,


262
0:18:34,789 --> 0:18:39,84
IT'S TAKES UP THE MAJORITY OF THE SEED AND
IS THE MAIN NUTRITIVE


263
0:18:39,84 --> 0:18:45,11
TISSUE FOR THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO AFTER IT
DEVELOP, AFTER


264
0:18:45,11 --> 0:18:50,13
FERTILIZATION OF THE EGG. SO IN THE CASE OF
THE FLOWERING


265
0:18:50,13 --> 0:18:54,63
PLANTS, THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE, IT'S NOT THIS
LARGE MULTICELLULAR


266
0:18:54,63 --> 0:18:58,13
GAMETOPHYTE OR I SAID LARGE, YOU KNOW, FAIR-,
RELATIVELY


267
0:18:58,13 --> 0:19:2,73
SPEAKING, BUT MORE CELLS THAN YOU'D CARE TO
COUNT THAT'S FOR SURE


268
0:19:2,73 --> 0:19:6,39
IN THE CASE OF THE GYMNOSPERM FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE.
AND THE


269
0:19:6,39 --> 0:19:11,33
PRESENCE USUALLY OF MULTIPLE ARCHEGONIA IN
THE GYMNOSPERM FEMALE


270
0:19:11,33 --> 0:19:14,78
GAMETOPHYTE REMEMBER WHERE THE EGGS ARE FOUND.
BUT IN THE


271
0:19:14,78 --> 0:19:19,26
FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE OF ANGIOSPERMS, THE MATURE
FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE


272
0:19:19,26 --> 0:19:26,28
ONLY CONSISTS USUALLY OF ABOUT SEVEN CELLS
AND EIGHT NUCLEI.


273
0:19:26,28 --> 0:19:29,82
ONE OF THE CELLS, THE CENTRAL CELL, THE LARGEST
HAS TWO NUCLEI,


274
0:19:29,82 --> 0:19:33,909
WHAT ARE CALLED THE POLAR NUCLEI. BUT HERE
YOU CAN SEE THE


275
0:19:33,909 --> 0:19:39,26
OPENING IN THE OVULE HERE WHERE THE POLLEN
TUBE WILL ENTER. AND


276
0:19:39,26 --> 0:19:41,9
THERE'S VERY LITTLE TO THIS FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE.
THERE ARE THREE


277
0:19:41,9 --> 0:19:47,32
CELLS UP AT THE BACK END OF THE OVULE, THE
ANTIPODAL SO-CALLED,


278
0:19:47,32 --> 0:19:50,63
THESE TWO POLAR NUCLEI IN THE BIG CENTRAL
CELL. AND HERE'S THE


279
0:19:50,63 --> 0:19:56,23
EGG AGAIN CLOSE TO THE OPENING IN THE OVULE,
THE MICROPYLAR END.


280
0:19:56,23 --> 0:19:59,83
AND IT'S FLANKED BY TWO INDIVIDUAL CELLS,
ONE ON EITHER SIDE,


281
0:19:59,83 --> 0:20:3,279
THAT ARE CALLED SYNERGIDS. NOT IMPORTANT BUT
THESE MAY BE THE


282
0:20:3,279 --> 0:20:7,87
VESTIGES OF AN ARCHEGONIUM. BUT THERE'S REALLY
NO CLEAR


283
0:20:7,87 --> 0:20:13,27
ARCHEGONIUM PRESENT, NO GAMETANGIUM, YOU KNOW
SAC THAT CONTAINS


284
0:20:13,27 --> 0:20:17,71
THE GAMETES. JUST LIKE IN THE POLLEN, THEY'VE
LOST THE


285
0:20:17,71 --> 0:20:17,71



286
0:20:17,71 --> 0:20:21,75
GAMETANGIUM. SO THE ANGIOSPERMS DON'T HAVE
EITHER FEMALE OR


287
0:20:21,75 --> 0:20:26,57
MALE GAMETANGIA IN THEIR GAMETOPHYTES. THOSE
ARE THE REALLY


288
0:20:26,57 --> 0:20:31,29
STRIPPED DOWN FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE AND THE SUPER
STRIPPED DOWN MALE


289
0:20:31,29 --> 0:20:34,5
GAMETOPHYTE AS WELL AS IN THE ANGIOSPERMS.
SO A PRETTY MINOR


290
0:20:34,5 --> 0:20:38,99
INVESTMENT HERE COMPARED TO THE WHAT THE GYMNOSPERMS
MAKE IN


291
0:20:38,99 --> 0:20:44,25
THEIR GAMETOPHYTES. ALL RIGHT, SO FERTILIZATION,
WE TALKED


292
0:20:44,25 --> 0:20:49,49
ABOUT POLLINATION LAST TIME OF ANGIOSPERMS
WHERE THE POLLEN'S


293
0:20:49,49 --> 0:20:53,85
DEPOSITED NOT ON THE OVULE ITSELF LIKE IN
GYMNOSPERMS, BUT AT THE


294
0:20:53,85 --> 0:20:58,659
STIGMATIC AREA, ON THE STIGMA. AND WE TALKED
ABOUT HOW THE


295
0:20:58,659 --> 0:21:2,35
POLLEN TUBES HAVE TO GROW DOWN THROUGH THE
STYLE TO REACH THE


296
0:21:2,35 --> 0:21:9,96
OVULES. AND ONCE THAT OCCURS, THE POLLEN TUBES
GROW IN THROUGH


297
0:21:9,96 --> 0:21:16,679
THE MICROPYLAR END, AS THEY DO IN GYMNOSPERMS.
AND WE HAVE


298
0:21:16,679 --> 0:21:20,72
FERTILIZATION OF THE EGG BY ONE OF THE SPERM
CELLS. AND THERE'S


299
0:21:20,72 --> 0:21:24,21
NEVER ANY FLAGELLAE ON THE, I THINK I ALREADY
MENTIONED THERE'S


300
0:21:24,21 --> 0:21:27,59
NO FLAGELLUM ON THE SPERM AND ANGIOSPERMS.
THEY'RE DELIVERED


301
0:21:27,59 --> 0:21:33,8
RIGHT TO THE, TO THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE BY
THE POLLEN TUBE. SO


302
0:21:33,8 --> 0:21:36,36
THAT'S NOTHING NEW IN TERMS OF A ZYGOTE BEING
FORMED. BUT THE


303
0:21:36,36 --> 0:21:43,63
OTHER SPERM, THE SECOND SPERM PRODUCED BY
THE POLLEN TUBE, ALSO


304
0:21:43,63 --> 0:21:48,34
UNDERGOES FUSION NOT WITH THE EGG BUT WITH
THOSE TWO POLAR NUCLEI


305
0:21:48,34 --> 0:21:52,669
IN THE CENTRAL CELL. AND SO YOU END UP WITH
THIS TRIPLOID


306
0:21:52,669 --> 0:21:56,89
NUCLEUS. AND THIS WILL NOW UNDERGO A LOT OF
FREE NUCLEAR


307
0:21:56,89 --> 0:22:2,38
DIVISIONS WITHOUT THE FORMATION OF CELL MEMBRANES
AND CELL WALLS


308
0:22:2,38 --> 0:22:6,669
SEPARATING THEM FROM ONE ANOTHER INITIALLY.
AND THEN IT'LL START


309
0:22:6,669 --> 0:22:12,5
WALLING OFF THOSE NUCLEI. SO WE GO FROM THIS
MILKY ENDOSPERM TO


310
0:22:12,5 --> 0:22:16,19
A CELLULAR ENDOSPERM. NOW THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF THIS, SO WHAT


311
0:22:16,19 --> 0:22:16,19



312
0:22:16,19 --> 0:22:20,58
HAPPENS IS AFTER THE ZYGOTE FORMS AND THIS
ENDOSPERM FORMS, WE


313
0:22:20,58 --> 0:22:26,89
START GETTING A LOT OF ACTIVITY OF THIS ENDOSPERM
TISSUE. IT


314
0:22:26,89 --> 0:22:30,37
STARTS RAPIDLY DEVELOPING REALLY BEFORE THE
ZYGOTE'S DOING


315
0:22:30,37 --> 0:22:34,429
ANYTHING. SO WE'RE INVESTING IN WHAT BECOMES
THE NUTRITIVE


316
0:22:34,429 --> 0:22:37,429
TISSUE. THE ENDOSPERM BECOMES THE NUTRITIVE
TISSUE FOR THE


317
0:22:37,429 --> 0:22:41,159
EMBRYO, THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO. THOUGH THE
IMPORTANT THING TO


318
0:22:41,159 --> 0:22:45,809
CONSIDER HERE IS THAT IN THE GYMNOSPERMS,
THERE'S THIS HUGE


319
0:22:45,809 --> 0:22:49,63
INVESTMENT IN THE FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE, THIS
VERY LARGE ORGANISM


320
0:22:49,63 --> 0:22:55,39
INSIDE THE SEED RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF THE
FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE IN


321
0:22:55,39 --> 0:23:1,779
ANGIOSPERMS. BUT IN THE CASE OF, BUT IF IT
DOESN'T GET, IF THE


322
0:23:1,779 --> 0:23:5,76
EGG DOESN'T GET FERTILIZED IN A GYMNOSPERM,
ALL THAT INVESTMENT


323
0:23:5,76 --> 0:23:8,799
IS A BIG WASTE OF RESOURCES FOR THE PARENT
SPOROPHYTE THAT


324
0:23:8,799 --> 0:23:13,27
PRODUCED THOSE OVULES BECAUSE THAT FEMALE
GAMETOPHYTE AND THE


325
0:23:13,27 --> 0:23:17,34
GYMNOSPERM IS PARASITIC ON THE, ON THE SPOROPHYTE
THAT GAVE BIRTH


326
0:23:17,34 --> 0:23:23,26
TO IT. SO THAT'S A REAL PROB-, OR THAT'S A
POTENTIAL PROBLEM IN


327
0:23:23,26 --> 0:23:28,2
TERMS OF WASTAGE THAT ANGIOSPERMS GET AROUND
BY WAITING TO INVEST


328
0:23:28,2 --> 0:23:31,65
IN THE NUTRITIVE TISSUE FOR THEIR DEVELOPING
EMBRYOS UNTIL AFTER


329
0:23:31,65 --> 0:23:38,4
FERTILIZATION HAPPENS. SO ANGIOSPERMS WAIT
AND THEN START


330
0:23:38,4 --> 0:23:43,62
DEVELOPING THE NUTRITIVE TISSUE, THIS ENDOSPERM.
AND IF YOU'VE


331
0:23:43,62 --> 0:23:47,37
EVER BROKEN OPEN A COCONUT, WHICH COCONUTS
HAVE THE WORLD'S


332
0:23:47,37 --> 0:23:53,8
LARGEST SEED SO THIS IS EASY TO SEE, THE MILK
INSIDE THE COCONUT


333
0:23:53,8 --> 0:23:58,549
IS THE ACELLULAR ENDOSPERM, SO THAT'S THE
FREE NUCLEI FLOATING IN


334
0:23:58,549 --> 0:24:2,57
CYTOPLASM WHERE WE HAVEN'T YET HAD CELL WALLS
FORM. WHEREAS THE


335
0:24:2,57 --> 0:24:5,47
MEAT OF THE COCONUT THAT LINES THE INSIDE
OF THE SEED, THAT'S THE


336
0:24:5,47 --> 0:24:10,179
CELLULAR ENDOSPERM THAT, WHERE WE HAVE HAD
CELL MEMBRANES AND


337
0:24:10,179 --> 0:24:10,179



338
0:24:10,179 --> 0:24:13,789
CELL WALLS PARTITION OFF THE NUCLEI. AND THE
EMBRYO'S REALLY


339
0:24:13,789 --> 0:24:18,33
JUST A TINY LITTLE THING THAT YOU HAVE TO
BREAK OPEN THE, YOU


340
0:24:18,33 --> 0:24:25,22
HAVE TO DIG AROUND IN THE CELLULAR ENDOSPERM
TO LOCATE. SO


341
0:24:25,22 --> 0:24:28,59
THAT'S, GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT FOR
ENDOSPERM. SO ARE


342
0:24:28,59 --> 0:24:36,39
THERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT DOUBLE FERTILIZATION
THEN? OKAY, SO IN


343
0:24:36,39 --> 0:24:41,94
THE END THEN AN ANGIOSPERM SEED -- YEAH?


344
0:24:41,94 --> 0:24:44,399
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]


345
0:24:44,399 --> 0:24:47,789
PROFESSOR: THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S, THAT'S


346
0:24:47,789 --> 0:24:50,97
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET TO RIGHT NOW.
IT'S REALLY


347
0:24:50,97 --> 0:24:55,24
UNCLEAR TO BE FRANK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF WHETHER
THE TRIPLOIDY OF


348
0:24:55,24 --> 0:24:59,86
THOSE NUCLEI, YOU KNOW, HAS ANY NUTRITIVE
BENEFIT TO THE EMBRYO


349
0:24:59,86 --> 0:25:4,279
OR NOT. BUT IT IS STILL A CLEAR DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN WHAT YOU SEE


350
0:25:4,279 --> 0:25:9,0
IN AN ANGIOSPERM SEED VERSUS A GYNOPSPERM
SEED. HERE'S A CARTOON


351
0:25:9,0 --> 0:25:13,46
OF AN ANGIOSPERM SEED. AGAIN WE HAVE THIS
DIPLOID EMBRYO, THE


352
0:25:13,46 --> 0:25:19,429
YOUNG SPOROPHYTE. WE HAVE THE TRIPLOID ENDOSPERM
THAT FORMS THE


353
0:25:19,429 --> 0:25:23,7
NUTRITIVE TISSUE FROM, DEVELOPED AFTER FERTILIZATION
WITH THAT


354
0:25:23,7 --> 0:25:28,1
SECOND SPERM FUSING TO THE POLAR NUCLEI. AND
THEN WE HAVE


355
0:25:28,1 --> 0:25:31,919
DIPLOID SEED COAT TISSUE FROM THE INTEGUMENT
THAT WAS PRODUCED


356
0:25:31,919 --> 0:25:36,96
AROUND THE OVULE BY THE PARENT SPOROPHYTE
THAT MADE THE OVULE.


357
0:25:36,96 --> 0:25:41,309
AND IN CONTRAST IN THE GYMNOSPERM WE HAVE
BASICALLY THE SAME


358
0:25:41,309 --> 0:25:44,49
ARRANGEMENT EXCEPT FOR THE NUTRITIVE TISSUE
HERE IS HAPLOID, IT'S


359
0:25:44,49 --> 0:25:49,1
FEMALE GAMETOPHYTE TISSUE. WHEREAS THE FEMALE
GAMETOPHYTE, IT'S


360
0:25:49,1 --> 0:25:53,549
RELATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF ITS NUTRITIVE
VALUE TO THE


361
0:25:53,549 --> 0:26:1,919
EMBRYO COMPARED TO THE ENDOSPERM. OKAY? THOUGH
THIS INVESTMENT


362
0:26:1,919 --> 0:26:5,509
WAS MADE BEFORE FERTILIZATION. THIS INVESTMENT
WAS MADE AFTER


363
0:26:5,509 --> 0:26:5,61



364
0:26:5,61 --> 0:26:11,929
FERTILIZATION IN THAT NUTRITIVE TISSUE. ALL
RIGHT, SO ANOTHER


365
0:26:11,929 --> 0:26:16,37
INNOVATION THAT MAY HELP TO EXPLAIN SUCCESS
OF ANGIOSPERMS IN


366
0:26:16,37 --> 0:26:21,86
PART IS THE EVOLUTION OF FRUIT. AND WE'VE
TALKED ABOUT FRUITING


367
0:26:21,86 --> 0:26:25,61
BODIES IN MUSHROOMS. BUT THAT'S SHORTHAND.
STRICTLY


368
0:26:25,61 --> 0:26:30,23
BOTANICALLY SPEAKING, THE ONLY REAL FRUIT
IS PRODUCED BY


369
0:26:30,23 --> 0:26:36,72
ANGIOSPERMS. AND FRUIT HAS REAL VALUE TO ANGIOSPERMS
IN TERMS OF


370
0:26:36,72 --> 0:26:40,25
PROMOTING DISPERSAL OF SEEDS. SO WE TALKED
ABOUT DIFFERENT


371
0:26:40,25 --> 0:26:43,74
POLLINATION SPECIALIZATIONS, THESE DIFFERENT
POLLINATION


372
0:26:43,74 --> 0:26:48,95
SYNDROMES, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT PROMOTE DISPERSAL
OF POLLEN WHICH IS


373
0:26:48,95 --> 0:26:52,6
ONE WAY IN WHICH ANGIOSPERMS CAN GET THEIR
GENES AROUND IS BY


374
0:26:52,6 --> 0:26:56,789
MOVING AROUND THE MALE GAMETOPHYTES WHICH
ARE MOBILE RELATIVE TO


375
0:26:56,789 --> 0:27:0,24
THE REST OF THE LIFE CYCLE. THE OTHER STAGE
OF THE LIFE CYCLE


376
0:27:0,24 --> 0:27:5,21
THAT'S MOBILE ARE THE SEEDS. AND SO FRUIT
IS AN INNOVATION OF


377
0:27:5,21 --> 0:27:12,14
ANGIOSPERMS THAT PROMOTES DISPERSAL OF SEEDS.
AND BASICALLY


378
0:27:12,14 --> 0:27:17,88
SPEAKING A FRUIT IN ITS STRICTEST SENSE IS
JUST A RIPENED OVARY.


379
0:27:17,88 --> 0:27:21,799
SO REMEMBER THE OVARY IS THE BASE OF THE PISTAL,
THE CHAMBER IN


380
0:27:21,799 --> 0:27:29,29
WHICH THE SEED OR, THE OVULE OR OVULES ARE
LOCATED. AND AT


381
0:27:29,29 --> 0:27:34,21
MATURITY THE RIPENED OVARY BECOMES ALL OR
PART OF THE FRUIT.


382
0:27:34,21 --> 0:27:38,289
SOMETIMES THERE ARE ADDITIONAL TISSUES THAT
MAKE UP THE DISPERSAL


383
0:27:38,289 --> 0:27:42,98
UNIT OF THE FRUIT. SOMETIMES THE FRUIT ISN'T
THE DISPERSAL UNIT


384
0:27:42,98 --> 0:27:50,149
BUT IT IS STILL THE RIPENED OVARY, AND WE'LL
GET TO THAT IN A


385
0:27:50,149 --> 0:27:53,94
SECOND, THAT IS, ANGIOSPERMS CAN DIRECTLY
RELEASE THEIR SEEDS AND


386
0:27:53,94 --> 0:27:56,99
THE SEEDS CAN BE DISPERSAL UNITS, BUT OFTEN
THE FRUIT IS THE


387
0:27:56,99 --> 0:28:1,1
DISPERSAL UNIT CONTAINING THE SEEDS. SO THERE'S
A LOT OF


388
0:28:1,1 --> 0:28:5,8
CLASSIFICATION THAT HAS REVOLVED AROUND DESCRIBING
DIFFERENT


389
0:28:5,8 --> 0:28:5,13



390
0:28:5,13 --> 0:28:8,58
TYPES OF FRUITS. AND THE IMPORTANT THING TO
REALIZE HERE IS


391
0:28:8,58 --> 0:28:11,83
THAT THE CLASSIFICATION OF FRUITS IS NOT A
NATURAL


392
0:28:11,83 --> 0:28:16,11
CLASSIFICATION, THAT IS IT DOESN'T REFLECT
PHYLOGENY. THESE


393
0:28:16,11 --> 0:28:20,809
DIFFERENT SO-CALLED TYPES OF FRUITS ARE CONVENIENT
WAYS OF


394
0:28:20,809 --> 0:28:25,97
CLASSIFYING FRUITS THAT HELP TO UNDERSTAND
THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE


395
0:28:25,97 --> 0:28:30,1
FRUITS, AND THE ANATOMY OF FRUITS AND CAN
ALSO BE BENEFICIAL IN


396
0:28:30,1 --> 0:28:34,779
UNDERSTANDING DISPERSAL. BUT THEY'RE NOT,
THESE DIFFERENT TYPES


397
0:28:34,779 --> 0:28:40,169
OF FRUITS HAVE EVOLVED MULTIPLE TIMES IN DIFFERENT
GROUPS OF


398
0:28:40,169 --> 0:28:44,299
FLOWERING PLANTS. AND THE MOST WIDESPREAD
TYPE OF FRUIT IN THIS


399
0:28:44,299 --> 0:28:47,519
THREE, THREE-TYPE CLASSIFICATION I'M GOING
TO TALK ABOUT HERE


400
0:28:47,519 --> 0:28:51,919
BRIEFLY IS IN YOUR TEXTBOOK IS CALLED A SIMPLE
FRUIT. AND A


401
0:28:51,919 --> 0:28:55,48
SIMPLE FRUIT'S A GOOD NAME FOR IT BECAUSE
IT SIMPLY IS A FRUIT


402
0:28:55,48 --> 0:29:0,539
DERIVED FROM ONE IS OVARY. THOUGH IT'S BASICALLY
DERIVED FROM


403
0:29:0,539 --> 0:29:5,679
ONE OVARY OF ONE FLOWER. THAT OVARY MIGHT
BE FROM ONE CARPEL OR


404
0:29:5,679 --> 0:29:8,71
FROM MULTIPLE CARPELS THAT WERE FUSED TOGETHER
INTO A COMPOUND


405
0:29:8,71 --> 0:29:12,44
PISTIL, BUT IT'S FROM ONE PISTIL REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER THAT


406
0:29:12,44 --> 0:29:18,429
PISTIL IS FROM ONE OR MORE CARPELS FUSED TOGETHER.
AND A


407
0:29:18,429 --> 0:29:22,64
CHERRY, APRICOT, THESE ARE GREAT EXAMPLES
OF SIMPLE FRUITS THAT


408
0:29:22,64 --> 0:29:25,98
ARE FLESHY FRUITS OBVIOUSLY, ALTHOUGH THE
PIT OF THE CHERRY, THE


409
0:29:25,98 --> 0:29:29,88
PIT OF THE APRICOT IS ALSO A FRUIT WALL THAT
PROTECTS THE SEED


410
0:29:29,88 --> 0:29:35,14
INSIDE. THERE ARE DIFFERENT WALLS OF, DIFFERENT
LAYERS OF FRUIT


411
0:29:35,14 --> 0:29:38,309
THAT CAN BE REALLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER.
AND FRUITS CAN


412
0:29:38,309 --> 0:29:43,36
BE DEHISCENT OR INDEHISCENT, THAT IS FRUITS
CAN OPEN UP AT


413
0:29:43,36 --> 0:29:46,73
MATURITY AND RELEASE THE SEEDS DIRECTLY IN
WHICH CASE THE SEED IS


414
0:29:46,73 --> 0:29:51,599
GENERALLY THE DISPERSAL UNIT, OR THE FRUIT
CAN REMAIN FUSED


415
0:29:51,599 --> 0:29:51,84



416
0:29:51,84 --> 0:29:55,659
AROUND THE, OR IT CAN REMAIN, IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY
OPEN BY SOME


417
0:29:55,659 --> 0:29:59,929
SORT OF SUTURE AND SURROUNDS THE SEEDS IN
WHICH CASE THE WHOLE


418
0:29:59,929 --> 0:30:11,21
FRUIT IS TYPICALLY THE DISPERSAL UNIT ALONG
WITH THE SEEDS. SO


419
0:30:11,21 --> 0:30:15,34
ANOTHER TYPE OF FRUIT THEN IS AN AGGREGATE
FRUIT, THE SECOND OF


420
0:30:15,34 --> 0:30:19,309
THESE THREE MAJOR TYPES THAT YOUR BOOK DESCRIBES.
AND AN


421
0:30:19,309 --> 0:30:23,21
AGGREGATE FRUIT IS SOMETHING LIKE A RASPBERRY
OR A BLACKBERRY


422
0:30:23,21 --> 0:30:26,82
THAT IS A FRUIT DERIVED FROM MORE THAN ONE
SEPARATE CARPEL OF ONE


423
0:30:26,82 --> 0:30:33,69
FLOWER. SO SEPARATE PISTILS, EACH FROM ONE
CARPEL YOU CAN SEE


424
0:30:33,69 --> 0:30:37,1
ARE THESE LITTLE, EACH ONE OF THESE LITTLE
FRUITLETS THAT MAKES


425
0:30:37,1 --> 0:30:43,47
UP A RASPBERRY OR BLACKBERRY IS AN INDIVIDUAL
PISTIL FROM ONE


426
0:30:43,47 --> 0:30:50,97
CARPEL THAT ARE, THEY'RE SEPARATE BUT THEY'RE
STILL BASICALLY


427
0:30:50,97 --> 0:30:55,519
PART OF A COMMON DISPERSAL UNIT HERE. THE
WHOLE, THE WHOLE


428
0:30:55,519 --> 0:30:59,85
AGGREGATE FRUIT IS REMOVED AS A UNIT TYPICALLY,
BY AN ANIMAL AND


429
0:30:59,85 --> 0:31:6,38
DISPERSED. SO THAT'S ONE, ANOTHER TYPE OF,
OF FRUIT THAT'S


430
0:31:6,38 --> 0:31:14,7
STILL IS FROM A SINGLE FLOWER BUT FROM MULTIPLE
PISTILS. AND


431
0:31:14,7 --> 0:31:18,58
ANOTHER TYPE OF FRUIT IS A MULTIPLE FRUIT.
AND A MULTIPLE FRUIT


432
0:31:18,58 --> 0:31:23,139
IS A FRUIT DERIVED FROM MULTIPLE FLOWERS.
AND THIS IS A CASE IN


433
0:31:23,139 --> 0:31:28,37
THE PINEAPPLE WHERE YOU HAVE CLEARLY DISTINCT
FLOWERS INITIALLY.


434
0:31:28,37 --> 0:31:32,57
I MEAN THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY DISTINCT AT THIS
POINT IN THEIR, IN


435
0:31:32,57 --> 0:31:36,63
THEIR DEVELOPMENT. AND THEN AFTER, AFTER WE'VE
HAD


436
0:31:36,63 --> 0:31:41,799
FERTILIZATION AND SEED DEVELOPMENT, THE FRUIT'S
DEVELOPING HERE.


437
0:31:41,799 --> 0:31:46,49
AND EVENTUALLY ALL OF THESE FLOWERS COALESCE
TOGETHER INTO ONE


438
0:31:46,49 --> 0:31:50,519
BIG DISPERSAL UNIT, ONE LARGE PINEAPPLE WHERE
EACH OF THE LITTLE


439
0:31:50,519 --> 0:31:55,19
SEGMENTS THAT YOU SEE, THOSE LITTLE WALLED-OFF
UNITS IN THE


440
0:31:55,19 --> 0:31:59,66
PINEAPPLE REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS OF
A COMMON INFLORESCENCE


441
0:31:59,66 --> 0:31:59,659



442
0:31:59,659 --> 0:32:4,399
OF AN ENTIRE ARRAY, A COMPACT ARRAY OF FLOWERS.
ANOTHER GREAT


443
0:32:4,399 --> 0:32:7,179
EXAMPLE OF THIS KIND OF FLOWER OR THIS KIND
OF FRUIT IS A


444
0:32:7,179 --> 0:32:12,49
MULBERRY WHICH LOOKS A LOT SUPERFICIALLY LIKE
SOMETHING LIKE A


445
0:32:12,49 --> 0:32:16,429
RASPBERRY BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MULTIPLE FLOWERS
THAT MAKE UP THAT,


446
0:32:16,429 --> 0:32:22,26
THAT STRUCTURE. AND HERE AGAIN, THE SIMPLE
FRUIT, THE AGGREGATE


447
0:32:22,26 --> 0:32:26,419
FRUIT, THE MULTIPLE FRUIT. FRUITS CAN BE EITHER
DRY, THEY DON'T


448
0:32:26,419 --> 0:32:32,24
HAVE TO BE FLESHY. FRUITS CAN BE DRY ALTOGETHER.
LIKE A PEAPOD


449
0:32:32,24 --> 0:32:37,429
AT MATURITY, IT DRIES OUT, SPLITS OPEN, AND
RELEASES THE SEEDS.


450
0:32:37,429 --> 0:32:42,269
THOUGH FRUIT IS JUST A MATURE OVARY. IT DOESN'T
NECESSARILY HAVE


451
0:32:42,269 --> 0:32:46,87
TO BE THE DISPERSAL UNIT BUT IT OFTEN IS.
AND EVEN IF IT IS, IF


452
0:32:46,87 --> 0:32:51,35
IT IS THE DISPERSAL UNIT, IT CAN BE DRY OR
FLESHY, AS WE'LL LOOK


453
0:32:51,35 --> 0:32:59,46
AT HERE IN A MINUTE. ONE LAST TYPE OF FRUIT
TO MENTION IS THIS


454
0:32:59,46 --> 0:33:2,97
ACCESSORY FRUIT. AND THIS IS KIND OF A COOL
THING TO THINK ABOUT


455
0:33:2,97 --> 0:33:9,5
BECAUSE IN ACCESSORY FRUITS, THE RIPENED OVARY
IS PART OF THE


456
0:33:9,5 --> 0:33:13,549
FRUIT BUT IT'S NOT THE FLESHY PART. THERE'S
ANOTHER FLESHY PART


457
0:33:13,549 --> 0:33:17,45
THAT'S DERIVED FROM OTHER PARTS OF EITHER
THE FLOWER OR THE


458
0:33:17,45 --> 0:33:21,51
INFLORESCENCE. AND THERE ARE ACCESSORY FRUITS
THAT FALL IN THE


459
0:33:21,51 --> 0:33:26,88
CATEGORY OF SIMPLE, AGGREGATE, AND MULTIPLE.
SO THIS IS A, SO


460
0:33:26,88 --> 0:33:29,899
SIMPLE AGG-, SIMPLE, AGGREGATE, AND MULTIPLE
FRUITS CAN ALSO BE


461
0:33:29,899 --> 0:33:34,97
ACCESSORY FRUITS WHEREAS I MENTIONED THE FRUIT
HAS FLESHY PARTS


462
0:33:34,97 --> 0:33:38,529
THAT ARE DERIVED FROM, LARGELY FROM TISSUES
OTHER THAN THE OVARY.


463
0:33:38,529 --> 0:33:42,57
AND AN APPLE'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS. SO
HERE'S THE STALK OF


464
0:33:42,57 --> 0:33:47,19
THE APPLE FLOWER, WHERE THE FLOWER WAS ATTACHED.
AND HERE'S


465
0:33:47,19 --> 0:33:53,919
WHAT'S LEFT OF THE, OF THE SEPALS, THE STAMENS,
AND THE, THE


466
0:33:53,919 --> 0:33:56,95
STYLES OF AN APPLE. AND YOU'VE KNOW DOUBT
SEEN THOSE AT THE


467
0:33:56,95 --> 0:33:56,95



468
0:33:56,95 --> 0:34:1,34
SUMMIT OF AN APPLE. SO THE OVARY IS RIGHT
HERE. THE OVARY IS


469
0:34:1,34 --> 0:34:5,39
THE CORE OF THE APPLE, THE PAPERY PART THAT
YOU GENERALLY DON'T


470
0:34:5,39 --> 0:34:10,92
EAT BUT THROW ASIDE. AND THE, THE REALLY JUICY
CHOICE PART OF


471
0:34:10,92 --> 0:34:15,18
THE APPLE, THIS OUTER PART IS ACCESSORY TISSUE.
IT'S ACTUALLY


472
0:34:15,18 --> 0:34:19,56
THE FLORAL TUBE FORMED FROM THE BASIS OF THE
SEPALS, PETALS, AND


473
0:34:19,56 --> 0:34:24,16
STAMENS THAT HAVE FUSED TOGETHER AND FUSED
AROUND THE OVARY. SO


474
0:34:24,16 --> 0:34:27,34
THE OVARY IS INFERIOR LIKE WE MENTIONED BEFORE.
IT'S PROTECTED


475
0:34:27,34 --> 0:34:33,16
BY THIS TISSUE. AND DISPERSAL AGENT COMING
AND GRABBING AN


476
0:34:33,16 --> 0:34:37,98
APPLE OR EATING AN APPLE IS PROBABLY GOING
TO BE CONSUMING MOSTLY


477
0:34:37,98 --> 0:34:42,66
THIS EXTERNAL PART AND LEAVING THE CORE AND
THE SEEDS. THOUGH


478
0:34:42,66 --> 0:34:46,58
THE ACCESSORY TISSUE'S IMPORTANT IN DISPERSAL
AND IT'S NOT PART


479
0:34:46,58 --> 0:34:50,5
OF THE OVARY. THE OVARY CAN BE SPARED FROM
BEING EATEN AND THE


480
0:34:50,5 --> 0:34:55,17
SEEDS AS WELL, BUT IT CAN GET MOVED AWAY FROM
THE PARENT PLANT.


481
0:34:55,17 --> 0:34:57,79
THE STRAWBERRY'S ANOTHER TYPE OF ACCESSORY
FRUIT THAT'S AN


482
0:34:57,79 --> 0:35:3,2
AGGREGATE. AND THE LITTLE GRAINY INCLUSIONS
ON THE OUTSIDE OF A


483
0:35:3,2 --> 0:35:6,65
STRAWBERRY, THOSE ARE THE OVARIES. SO THE
OVARIES ARE LITTLE DRY


484
0:35:6,65 --> 0:35:10,25
INDEHISCENT FRUITS THAT WE CALL ACHENES. THE
TERM'S NOT


485
0:35:10,25 --> 0:35:13,3
IMPORTANT, BUT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY, THEY
DON'T OPEN AT MATURITY.


486
0:35:13,3 --> 0:35:18,5
THEY CONTAIN A SINGLE SEED EACH. AND THE ACTUAL
FLESHY PART OF


487
0:35:18,5 --> 0:35:22,8
A STRAWBERRY IS THE RECEPTACLE OF THE FLOWER,
WHICH IS BASICALLY


488
0:35:22,8 --> 0:35:26,31
THE PODIUM ON WHICH THE OTHER PARTS OF THE
FLOWER ARE BORNE.


489
0:35:26,31 --> 0:35:28,67
AND IT'S USUALLY NOT AN ENLARGED STRUCTURE.
IT'S PRETTY


490
0:35:28,67 --> 0:35:32,45
INSIGNIFICANT. WE DIDN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT
BEFORE. IT'S JUST


491
0:35:32,45 --> 0:35:37,35
THE TIP OF THE STEM THAT THE FLOWER'S BORNE
ON, BUT IT BECOMES


492
0:35:37,35 --> 0:35:41,48
THE FLESHY PART OF THE FRUIT THAT'S THE ATTRACTANT
FOR ANIMAL


493
0:35:41,48 --> 0:35:41,89



494
0:35:41,89 --> 0:35:48,2
DISPERSAL HERE. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THE SEPALS.
AND IN A FIG,


495
0:35:48,2 --> 0:35:50,78
THE FLESHY PART OF THE FRUIT IS BASICALLY
THE WHOLE


496
0:35:50,78 --> 0:35:54,37
INFLORESCENCE. THE FIG INFLORESCENCE IS LIKE
AN INFLORESCENCE


497
0:35:54,37 --> 0:36:1,31
TURNED INSIDE OUT. AND THE, ALL THE FLESHY
JUICY PART IS MOSTLY


498
0:36:1,31 --> 0:36:6,58
NON-FLORAL TISSUE. SO IT'S THE WHOLE INFLORESCENCE.
THOUGH


499
0:36:6,58 --> 0:36:14,86
THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATION AND DIVERSITY
IN FRUIT MORPHOLOGY.


500
0:36:14,86 --> 0:36:18,88
AND IN DIFFERENT GROUP OF PLANTS THEY'VE GONE
IN FOR VERY


501
0:36:18,88 --> 0:36:25,36
DIFFERENT KINDS OF WAYS OF ATTRACTING POLLINATORS
AND DISPERSING


502
0:36:25,36 --> 0:36:29,29
THEIR, THEIR SEEDS VIA DIFFERENT FRUIT INNOVATIONS.
AND SOME OF


503
0:36:29,29 --> 0:36:34,57
THESE ARE SHOWN HERE. NOW THIS IS DISPERSAL
BY WIND AND WATER.


504
0:36:34,57 --> 0:36:40,83
SO NON-ANIMAL DISPERSAL. AND THERE'S A REALLY
WIDE RANGE OF


505
0:36:40,83 --> 0:36:43,4
ADAPTATIONS TO NON-ANIMAL DISPERSAL, TO WIND
AND WATER DISPERSAL,


506
0:36:43,4 --> 0:36:48,93
OR ABIOTIC DISPERSAL IN ANGIOSPERMS. AND SOME
OF THESE ARE LIKE


507
0:36:48,93 --> 0:36:53,6
IN GYMNOSPERMS WHERE THE FRUIT OPENS UP AT
MATURITY AND RELEASES


508
0:36:53,6 --> 0:36:57,79
THE SEEDS, AND THE SEEDS MIGHT BE WINGED OR
HAVE A TUFT OF HAIR


509
0:36:57,79 --> 0:37:1,68
ON THEM THAT MAKES THEM DISPERSABLE BY WIND
FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE


510
0:37:1,68 --> 0:37:8,4
THIS WINGED GOURD SEED HERE. SO SIMILAR TO
SAY A PINE SEED.


511
0:37:8,4 --> 0:37:11,44
WHERE THE SEED'S THE DISPERSAL UNIT. BUT IN
OTHER CASES THE


512
0:37:11,44 --> 0:37:16,51
FRUIT IS DISPERSED IN THE WIND. FOR EXAMPLE,
IN A MAPLE, THERE


513
0:37:16,51 --> 0:37:19,85
ARE WINGS ON THE FRUIT, THIS KIND OF FRUIT
WE CALL SAMARA THAT


514
0:37:19,85 --> 0:37:23,38
BLOWS IN THE WIND. AND IN SOMETHING LIKE A
DANDELION, YOU'VE NO


515
0:37:23,38 --> 0:37:27,17
DOUBT SEEN THE FRUITS. THE FRUITS ARE ACTUALLY
DRY, INDEHISCENT


516
0:37:27,17 --> 0:37:32,32
STRUCTURES THAT ARE ATTACHED TO THE SEPALS
WHICH ARE PERSISTENT,


517
0:37:32,32 --> 0:37:37,9
AND THE SEPALS BECOME PARACHUTE-LIKE AND CARRY
THE FRUIT ALONG IN


518
0:37:37,9 --> 0:37:44,37
THE WIND, VERY BUOYANT. AND IN SOME PLANTS
THE ENTIRE PLANT IS


519
0:37:44,37 --> 0:37:44,37



520
0:37:44,37 --> 0:37:48,12
THE, IS A WIND DISPERSAL UNIT LIKE THE TUMBLEWEED
WHERE IT BREAKS


521
0:37:48,12 --> 0:37:52,81
OFF AT THE BASE AT MATURITY AFTER IT DRIES
OUT. THE OUTLINE OF


522
0:37:52,81 --> 0:37:55,46
THE WHOLE PLANT IS SPHERICAL, AND IT JUST
BLOWS IN THE WIND


523
0:37:55,46 --> 0:37:59,37
CARRYING ALL THE FRUITS WITH IT. SO THERE
ARE DIFFERENT UNITS


524
0:37:59,37 --> 0:38:3,97
OF DISPERSAL FROM THE SMALLEST UNIT, THE SEED,
TO THE ENTIRE


525
0:38:3,97 --> 0:38:9,33
PLANT. CACTI ARE ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE ENTIRE
STEMS CAN BE


526
0:38:9,33 --> 0:38:13,19
DISPERSED BY IMPALING AN ANIMAL'S LEG WITH
THE SPINES OF THE


527
0:38:13,19 --> 0:38:17,54
CACTUS AND CARRYING THE FRUIT ALONG WITH IT
LIKE IN THE SO-CALLED


528
0:38:17,54 --> 0:38:20,15
JUMPING CHOLLA DOWN IN OUR DESERTS HERE WHICH
ARE PRETTY


529
0:38:20,15 --> 0:38:25,13
DANGEROUS TO WALK AROUND FOR THAT REASON.
AND ALSO YOU CAN GET


530
0:38:25,13 --> 0:38:28,92
DISPERSAL BY WATER. A LOT OF DIFFERENT TROPICAL,
ESPECIALLY


531
0:38:28,92 --> 0:38:32,85
PLANTS, A LOT OF OUR ISLAND PLANTS IF YOU
GO TO THE HAWAIIAN


532
0:38:32,85 --> 0:38:37,16
ISLANDS OR TAHITI, SOME OF THE TROPICAL ISLANDS,
RIGHT ALONG THE


533
0:38:37,16 --> 0:38:39,97
EDGE OF THE WATER YOU'LL FIND A LOT OF PLANTS
THAT HAVE DISPERSAL


534
0:38:39,97 --> 0:38:45,75
ADAPTATIONS TO WATER, WHICH HAVE BUOYANT FRUITS
LIKE THE COCONUT.


535
0:38:45,75 --> 0:38:49,82
AND THESE FRUITS HAVE HARD SEED LAYERS OR
FRUIT LAYERS THAT


536
0:38:49,82 --> 0:38:57,21
PREVENT THE, THE SEED FROM BEING PENETRATED
BY SALT WATER UNTIL


537
0:38:57,21 --> 0:39:1,74
AFTER DISPERSAL. SO THIS IS ANOTHER WAY IN
WHICH PLANTS CAN GET


538
0:39:1,74 --> 0:39:5,9
AROUND. THOUGH AS I MENTIONED HERE, YOU KNOW
JUST AS FLOWERS


539
0:39:5,9 --> 0:39:9,55
HAVE EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO POLLINATORS, FRUITS
HAVE EVOLVED IN


540
0:39:9,55 --> 0:39:13,24
RESPONSE TO DISPERSAL AGENTS. AND SO WE HAVE
THESE, ALL OF


541
0:39:13,24 --> 0:39:17,27
THESE DISPERSAL, ALL OF THESE MECHANISMS FOR
DISPERSING POLLEN IN


542
0:39:17,27 --> 0:39:22,37
POLLINATION, WE HAVE ALL THESE MECHANISMS
FOR DISPERSING SEEDS


543
0:39:22,37 --> 0:39:26,55
WITH, THAT INVOLVE, OFTEN INVOLVE FRUIT. SO
THESE ARE VARIOUS


544
0:39:26,55 --> 0:39:31,3
IMPORTANT INNOVATIONS OF ANGIOSPERMS. AND
AS FAR AS ANIMAL


545
0:39:31,3 --> 0:39:31,3



546
0:39:31,3 --> 0:39:36,35
DISPERSAL GOES, THERE'S A REALLY WIDE DIVERSITY
HERE AS WELL.


547
0:39:36,35 --> 0:39:40,66
SOME DRY FRUITS ARE ANIMAL DISPERSED EITHER
INTENTIONALLY LIKE


548
0:39:40,66 --> 0:39:45,26
ACORNS WHICH CAN BEING PICKED UP BY SQUIRRELS
OR BLUEJAYS AND


549
0:39:45,26 --> 0:39:48,77
CARRIED SOME DISTANCE AND CACHED. AND THEN
SOME PROPORTION OF


550
0:39:48,77 --> 0:39:52,17
THOSE ARE FORGOTTEN ABOUT AND THEY END UP
GERMINATING. SOME ARE


551
0:39:52,17 --> 0:39:56,31
CARRIED LONG DISTANCES. JAYS CAN FLY BETWEEN
MOUNTAIN RANGES


552
0:39:56,31 --> 0:40:2,79
WITH ACORNS IN THEIR, DOWN, CARRIED INSIDE
AND REGURGITATED WHEN


553
0:40:2,79 --> 0:40:11,89
THEY GET TO A NEW AREA. SOME ARE INADVERTENT
LIKE BARBED FRUITS.


554
0:40:11,89 --> 0:40:15,22
AND SOME OF THESE ARE RELATIVELY PAINLESS
IN TERMS OF JUST HAVING


555
0:40:15,22 --> 0:40:19,48
SAY HOOK PRICKLES OR SOMETHING THAT ATTACHES
OR STICKY EXUDATES


556
0:40:19,48 --> 0:40:23,31
THAT ATTACHED TO THE OUTSIDE OF FUR OR FEATHERS
AND ARE CARRIED


557
0:40:23,31 --> 0:40:29,25
FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER INADVERTENTLY. BUT
OTHERS ARE MORE


558
0:40:29,25 --> 0:40:33,64
INSIDIOUS. THE PUNCTURE VINE HAS FRUITS THAT
ACTUALLY WILL


559
0:40:33,64 --> 0:40:37,16
PUNTURE THE FEET OF ANIMALS, INCLUDING PEOPLE
IF YOU'RE WALKING


560
0:40:37,16 --> 0:40:41,9
AROUND BAREFOOT IN THE DESERT, AND REALLY
NASTY THINGS THAT YOU


561
0:40:41,9 --> 0:40:45,4
HAVE TO TAKE SOME EFFORT TO GET OUT AND PRESUMABLY
CARRIED SOME


562
0:40:45,4 --> 0:40:50,8
DISTANCE SOMETIMES BEFORE THEY'RE REMOVED.
SOMETIMES AGAIN THE


563
0:40:50,8 --> 0:40:54,57
SEED IS THE DISPERSAL UNIT. AND LIKE IN THE
GOURD I SHOWED YOU


564
0:40:54,57 --> 0:40:57,54
THAT ARE, THAT'S WIND DISPERSED, SOMETIMES
THE SEED HAS SOME


565
0:40:57,54 --> 0:41:1,86
INTERESTING INNOVATIONS TO PROMOTE DISPERSAL
THAT WE DON'T SEE IN


566
0:41:1,86 --> 0:41:8,27
GYMNOSPERMS, FOR EXAMPLE, LIKE THIS LITTLE
FLESHY ATTACHMENT TO


567
0:41:8,27 --> 0:41:11,81
THE SEED HERE. THE TERM'S AN ELAIOSOME. YOU
DON'T HAVE TO


568
0:41:11,81 --> 0:41:20,29
KNOW THAT, BUT IT'S A LITTLE EDIBLE BODY,
HIGH IN OIL OR PROTEIN


569
0:41:20,29 --> 0:41:23,76
THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE SEED AND MAKES THEM
ATTRACTIVE TO ANTS


570
0:41:23,76 --> 0:41:26,53
WHICH'LL CARRY THEM ACTIVELY TO THEIR NEST
SOME DISTANCE AWAY


571
0:41:26,53 --> 0:41:26,53



572
0:41:26,53 --> 0:41:30,54
FROM THE PARENT PLANT. THEY'LL CACHE THESE
SEEDS DOWN IN THEIR


573
0:41:30,54 --> 0:41:34,12
NEST. THEY'LL EAT THE, THE FOOD BODY. AND
THEN THEY'LL DISCARD


574
0:41:34,12 --> 0:41:38,81
THE, THE SEED OR THE SEED WILL REMAIN IN THE
NEST AND EVENTUALLY


575
0:41:38,81 --> 0:41:42,3
GERMINATE. SO THERE ARE SOME, THIS HAS EVOLVED
MULTIPLE TIMES IN


576
0:41:42,3 --> 0:41:45,13
DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PLANTS. AND THEN, OF COURSE,
THERE ARE


577
0:41:45,13 --> 0:41:48,69
FLESHY FRUITS THAT ARE, OR OTHER, OR EVEN
DRIED FRUITS THAT ARE


578
0:41:48,69 --> 0:41:52,85
EATEN DIRECTLY. AND THE FRUIT MAY BE DIGESTED,
BUT THE SEED


579
0:41:52,85 --> 0:41:56,41
ISN'T. IN FACT, THE SEED CAN BE STIMULATED
TO GERMINATE BY THE


580
0:41:56,41 --> 0:42:1,84
CHEMISTRY OF THE GUT AND THEN ENDS UP IN SOME
FERTILIZER AT THE


581
0:42:1,84 --> 0:42:8,42
END OF THE PROCESS AND GERMINATES FROM THAT.
SO LOTS OF GREAT


582
0:42:8,42 --> 0:42:15,0
DISPERSAL ADAPTATIONS. AND JUST ONE FINAL
NOTE ABOUT FRUIT IS


583
0:42:15,0 --> 0:42:17,3
THAT, YOU KNOW WE PROBABLY ALL THINK WE KNOW
WHAT FRUIT IS AND


584
0:42:17,3 --> 0:42:23,96
WHAT VEGETABLES ARE, BUT THESE ARE ALL CLASSIFIED
BY U.S. LAW AS


585
0:42:23,96 --> 0:42:27,35
VEGETABLES. AND YOU CAN SEE SOME THINGS IN
HERE THAT ARE


586
0:42:27,35 --> 0:42:31,82
CLEARLY FRUITS, TOMATOES, FOR EXAMPLE, PEPPERS.
THESE ARE


587
0:42:31,82 --> 0:42:37,74
RIPENED OVARIES THAT CONTAIN SEEDS AS YOU'RE
ALL AWARE. BUT


588
0:42:37,74 --> 0:42:41,17
THEY'RE OFFICIALLY CONSIDERED VEGETABLES BECAUSE
THEY HAVE


589
0:42:41,17 --> 0:42:44,91
SAVOURY RATHER THAN SWEET FLAVOR. AND ACTUALLY
THERE WAS A CASE


590
0:42:44,91 --> 0:42:50,2
THAT WAS TAKEN TO THE SUPREME COURT YEARS
AGO BY AN IMPORTER WHO


591
0:42:50,2 --> 0:42:54,95
WAS BRINGING IN TOMATOES FROM OUTSIDE THE
COUNTRY. AND THERE WAS


592
0:42:54,95 --> 0:42:59,4
A TARIFF ON VEGETABLES AT THE TIME BUT NOT
ON FRUIT. AND SO HE


593
0:42:59,4 --> 0:43:1,74
ARGUED THAT, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST BRINGING FRUIT
IN. I'M NOT


594
0:43:1,74 --> 0:43:5,5
BRINGING IN VEGETABLES. I DON'T HAVE TO PAY
THIS TARIFF. AND


595
0:43:5,5 --> 0:43:7,99
IT WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT.
AND THE SUPREME COURT


596
0:43:7,99 --> 0:43:12,28
RULED THAT YES, WE AGREE THAT BOTANICALLY
THE TOMATO IS A FRUIT,


597
0:43:12,28 --> 0:43:12,7



598
0:43:12,7 --> 0:43:15,87
BUT WE RULE IT OFFICIALLY BY U.S. LAW TO BE
A VEGETABLE.


599
0:43:15,87 --> 0:43:21,19
[LAUGHTER] SO, SO THE SUPREME COURT HAD THE
LAST WORD ON IT EVEN


600
0:43:21,19 --> 0:43:25,19
THOUGH, YOU KNOW, THE BOTANISTS HAD TO TAKE
SECOND PLACE THERE.


601
0:43:25,19 --> 0:43:29,85
BUT BOTANICALLY SPEAKING FROM THIS COURSE'S
PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST,


602
0:43:29,85 --> 0:43:37,2
WE'RE GOING TO CONSIDER IT A FRUIT. ALL RIGHT,
SO ANGIOSPERM


603
0:43:37,2 --> 0:43:42,72
DIVERSITY AS I MENTIONED, HUGE ALL OVER THE
WORLD. WE'RE STILL


604
0:43:42,72 --> 0:43:46,2
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH DIVERSITY'S
OUT THERE AND HOW IT'S


605
0:43:46,2 --> 0:43:49,85
RELATED, HOW THESE DIFFERENT ANGIOSPERMS ARE
RELATED TO ONE


606
0:43:49,85 --> 0:43:54,41
ANOTHER. AND AS I MENTIONED, HOW ANGIOSPERMS
ARE RELATED TO


607
0:43:54,41 --> 0:43:58,41
OTHER SEED PLANTS, GYMNOSPERMS, IS SOMETHING
THAT WE HAVEN'T


608
0:43:58,41 --> 0:44:2,72
FIGURED OUT. FOR AWHILE WE THOUGHT WE HAD.
IN FACT, LIKE TEN


609
0:44:2,72 --> 0:44:5,36
YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS TEACHING MY UPPER DIVERSION
SYSTEMATICS


610
0:44:5,36 --> 0:44:8,78
COURSE, IT WAS DOGMA THAT THE ANGIOSPERMS
WERE THE CLOSEST


611
0:44:8,78 --> 0:44:12,91
RELATIVES OF THE GNETOPHYTES, THOSE THINGS
LIKE THE PLATYPUS OF


612
0:44:12,91 --> 0:44:17,36
THE PLANT KINGDOM THAT I SHOWED YOU. THE WELWITSCHIA,
OR THE


613
0:44:17,36 --> 0:44:20,72
EPHEDRA THAT PRODUCES THAT STIMULANT EPHEDRIN.
BUT NOW IT'S


614
0:44:20,72 --> 0:44:23,72
CLEAR THAT THOSE ARE ACTUALLY MORE CLOSELY
RELATED TO CONIFERS


615
0:44:23,72 --> 0:44:27,1
THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THE GNETOPHYTES AND THE
CONIFERS ARE


616
0:44:27,1 --> 0:44:30,73
CLOSELY RELATED. AND WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE
CLOSEST RELATIVES


617
0:44:30,73 --> 0:44:34,34
OF THE ANGIOSPERMS ARE, BUT WE DO HAVE A BETTER
IDEA ABOUT


618
0:44:34,34 --> 0:44:39,99
RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE MAJOR GROUPS OF ANGIOSPERMS.
AND FROM


619
0:44:39,99 --> 0:44:44,17
HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY IF YOU HAD ANY MENTION
OF FLOWERING PLANTS


620
0:44:44,17 --> 0:44:49,36
THERE, YOU PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT DICOTS VERSUS
MONOCOTS, THESE TWO


621
0:44:49,36 --> 0:44:52,83
MAJOR GROUPS OF FLOWERING PLANTS. WELL, IT
TURNS OUT THAT'S


622
0:44:52,83 --> 0:44:56,15
SORT OF AN ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTION. ITS TRADITIONAL



623
0:44:56,15 --> 0:44:59,69
DISTINCTION'S SIMPLISTIC. AND THE MONOCOTS
ARE A GOOD


624
0:44:59,69 --> 0:45:3,98
MONOPHYLETIC GROUP. AND WE'LL GET TO THEIR
FEATURES IN A


625
0:45:3,98 --> 0:45:7,37
MOMENT. BUT THAT INCLUDES ABOUT A QUARTER
OF ALL FLOWERING


626
0:45:7,37 --> 0:45:11,31
PLANTS. SO THAT'S A HUGE DIVERSITY OF FLOWERING
PLANTS THERE.


627
0:45:11,31 --> 0:45:17,46
IT INCLUDES THE GRASSES AND GRAINS. THE DICOTS
THOUGH ARE ALL


628
0:45:17,46 --> 0:45:21,35
THESE YELLOW LINEAGES, AND SO THEY'RE NOT
A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP.


629
0:45:21,35 --> 0:45:25,2
THEY'RE A PARAPHYLETIC GRADE. AND IT LOOKS
LIKE THE PRESENCE OF


630
0:45:25,2 --> 0:45:29,87
TWO COTYLEDONOUS OR EMBRYONIC LEAVES IS ANCESTRAL
FOR FLOWERING


631
0:45:29,87 --> 0:45:32,96
PLANTS. AND IT'S NOT A DERIVED FEATURE THAT
DIAGNOSES A


632
0:45:32,96 --> 0:45:38,2
MONOPHYLETIC GROUP. BUT THERE IS ONE GROUP
CALLED THE EUDICOTS


633
0:45:38,2 --> 0:45:43,3
THAT CONTAINS ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF ALL ANGIOSPERM
DIVERSITY,


634
0:45:43,3 --> 0:45:46,57
TWO-THIRDS OF THE RECOGNIZED SPECIES. AND
REMEMBER EU MEANS


635
0:45:46,57 --> 0:45:51,17
TRUE, THESE ARE THE TRUE DICOTS AS THEY'RE
SO-CALLED NOW EVEN


636
0:45:51,17 --> 0:45:54,43
THOUGH THESE OTHER LINEAGES DO HAVE TWO COTYLEDONS.
AND THEY'RE


637
0:45:54,43 --> 0:45:57,92
A NICE MONOPHYLETIC GROUP. TOGETHER WITH THE
MONOCOTS THEY MAKE


638
0:45:57,92 --> 0:46:2,91
UP THE VAST MAJORITY OF ALL THE FLOWERING
PLANTS. THESE OLDEST


639
0:46:2,91 --> 0:46:6,66
LIVING LINEAGES HERE, WHICH YOU NO DOUBT,
WELL, YOU MAY HAVE SEEN


640
0:46:6,66 --> 0:46:9,88
WATER LILIES WHICH ARE AMONG SOME OF THE EARLY
DIVERGING


641
0:46:9,88 --> 0:46:14,44
LINEAGES, BUT THE OTHERS ARE OBSCURE, MOSTLY
SOUTHERN TEMPERATE,


642
0:46:14,44 --> 0:46:17,27
SOUTHERN TEMPERATE GROUPS IN THE SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE. THAT'S


643
0:46:17,27 --> 0:46:21,38
ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED SPECIES TOTAL THERE.
AND THE MAGNOLIAS AND


644
0:46:21,38 --> 0:46:25,79
RELATIVES, THAT'S ABOUT 8,000 SPECIES. BUT
THE BULK OF THE


645
0:46:25,79 --> 0:46:29,37
300,000 OR SO SPECIES ARE OVER HERE. AND WE'RE
GOING TO FOCUS ON


646
0:46:29,37 --> 0:46:36,12
THESE FOR THE REST OF THE COURSE. ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT THAT?


647
0:46:36,12 --> 0:46:39,49
THAT'S JUST SORT OF A GENERAL OVERVIEW. JUST
WANT TO MAKE IT


648
0:46:39,49 --> 0:46:39,6



649
0:46:39,6 --> 0:46:43,3
CLEAR THAT THE, WHY WE'RE CALLING THEM EUDICOTS
RATHER THAN


650
0:46:43,3 --> 0:46:46,81
DICOTS AS A WHOLE BECAUSE THIS IS THE NATURAL
GROUP OF DICOTS


651
0:46:46,81 --> 0:46:51,56
THAT MAKES UP MOST OF THEM. SO THESE ARE SOME
OF THE FEATURES


652
0:46:51,56 --> 0:46:57,91
SHARED BY MOST MONOCOTS AND SHARED BY MOST
DICOTS. AND IN SOME


653
0:46:57,91 --> 0:47:2,95
CASES THE FEATURE IS DERIVED IN THE MONOCOTS
AND SOME CASES, OR


654
0:47:2,95 --> 0:47:7,26
SOME CASES THE FEATURES THAT DISTINGUISH THEM,
IN ONE, ONE OF


655
0:47:7,26 --> 0:47:10,44
THEM'S DERIVED AND ONE OF THEM IS ANCESTRAL
BASICALLY HERE IN


656
0:47:10,44 --> 0:47:16,1
MOST OF THESE COMPARISONS. THOUGH MONOCOTS
HAVE ONE


657
0:47:16,1 --> 0:47:19,32
COTYLEDONOUS LEAF, AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT
MORE WHEN WE TALK


658
0:47:19,32 --> 0:47:25,74
ABOUT GERMINATION. AND THAT'S A GOOD FEATURE
THAT WE FIND ACROSS


659
0:47:25,74 --> 0:47:30,96
THE GROUP. ONE EMBRYONIC LEAF IS PRODUCED
IN MONOCOTS WHEREAS


660
0:47:30,96 --> 0:47:34,77
IN EUDICOTS LIKE IN OTHER DICOTS THERE ARE
TWO COTYLEDONOUS


661
0:47:34,77 --> 0:47:39,74
LEAVES THAT WE'LL LOOK AT HERE AGAIN IN MORE
DETAIL IN A MINUTE.


662
0:47:39,74 --> 0:47:42,77
AS FAR, THIS ISN'T VERY HELPFUL THOUGH BECAUSE
THE COTYLEDONS ARE


663
0:47:42,77 --> 0:47:45,63
LOST EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT. THEY'RE JUST EMBRYONIC
LEAVES THAT


664
0:47:45,63 --> 0:47:49,38
DON'T PERSIST VERY LONG. IN TERMS OF IDENTIFICATION
IT'S NOT A


665
0:47:49,38 --> 0:47:54,7
VERY HELPFUL FEATURE EVEN THOUGH IT'S CONSISTENT.
LEAF


666
0:47:54,7 --> 0:47:58,29
VENATION'S A GOOD FEATURE. MONOCOTS HAVE THIS
DERIVED FEATURE OF


667
0:47:58,29 --> 0:48:2,29
HAVING THEIR, THEIR VEINS, THE VASCULATURE
OF THEIR LEAVES IN A


668
0:48:2,29 --> 0:48:7,99
PARALLEL ORIENTATION OR SEMI-PARALLEL, AS
YOU CAN SEE, FOR


669
0:48:7,99 --> 0:48:13,8
EXAMPLE, IN A GRASS LEAF. WHEREAS THE VEINS
OF A EUDICOT ARE


670
0:48:13,8 --> 0:48:20,9
OFTEN NET-LIKE, SORT OF A RETICULUM OR WEB
OF VENATION DIVERGING


671
0:48:20,9 --> 0:48:24,1
IN DIFFERENT ANGLES WHICH IS NOT, IS ACTUALLY
AN ANCESTRAL


672
0:48:24,1 --> 0:48:30,8
FEATURE SHARED WITH EARLIER ANGIOSPERMS. IF
YOU CUT OPEN THE


673
0:48:30,8 --> 0:48:33,37
STEM, IF YOU DO A CROSS-SECTION OF THE STEM
 -- AND WE'RE GOING TO


674
0:48:33,37 --> 0:48:33,37



675
0:48:33,37 --> 0:48:37,36
GET INTO THIS A LOT MORE, SO I'M JUST GOING
TO BRUSH OVER IT NOW


676
0:48:37,36 --> 0:48:42,85
-THE VASCULAR OR CONDUCTING TISSUE IN A MONOCOT
STEM, VASCULAR


677
0:48:42,85 --> 0:48:46,75
TISSUE IN GENERAL IS IN LITTLE BUNDLES. THESE
LITTLE BUNDLES


678
0:48:46,75 --> 0:48:52,96
HERE INSIDE THE STEMS OF FLOWERING PLANTS
DURING PRIMARY GROWTH.


679
0:48:52,96 --> 0:48:56,45
WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT LATER. BUT IT'S
SCATTERED AROUND


680
0:48:56,45 --> 0:49:2,6
INSIDE THE STEMS OF MONOCOTS WHEREAS IN EUDICOTS,
THE BUNDLES ARE


681
0:49:2,6 --> 0:49:7,29
ARRANGED IN A RING LIKE THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING.
AND WE'LL TALK


682
0:49:7,29 --> 0:49:10,59
MORE ABOUT THAT LATER. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU CAN USE TO


683
0:49:10,59 --> 0:49:16,8
DISTINGUISH MONOCOTS AND DICOTS, EUDICOTS.
AND AS FAR AS ROOTS


684
0:49:16,8 --> 0:49:19,75
GO, THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT.
IN


685
0:49:19,75 --> 0:49:26,12
EUDICOTS, THE EMBRYONIC ROOT ACTUALLY CONTINUES
TO DEVELOP AS A


686
0:49:26,12 --> 0:49:30,31
TAPROOT, THE MAIN ROOT, AND THAN LATERAL ROOTS
ARE PRODUCED FROM


687
0:49:30,31 --> 0:49:35,62
THAT. WHEREAS IN MONOCOTS, THE TAPROOT DOESN'T
PERSIST VERY


688
0:49:35,62 --> 0:49:39,53
LONG. THE EMBRYONIC ROOT GROWS FOR AWHILE.
AND THEN YOU START


689
0:49:39,53 --> 0:49:43,55
GETTING ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS. AN ADVENTITIOUS
ANYTHING IS JUST


690
0:49:43,55 --> 0:49:46,73
SOMETHING THAT ORIGINATES FROM A POINT OTHER
THAN ITS USUAL


691
0:49:46,73 --> 0:49:51,7
ORIGIN. SO ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS FORM FROM THE
BASE OF STEMS. SO


692
0:49:51,7 --> 0:49:55,93
THE BASE OF THE STEM STARTS PRODUCING ROOTS.
AND THE TAPROOT


693
0:49:55,93 --> 0:49:59,13
DOESN'T CONTINUE TO DEVELOP. AND WE END UP
WITH A FIBROUS ROOT


694
0:49:59,13 --> 0:50:5,67
SYSTEM THAT'S OFTEN QUITE SHALLOW LIKE IN
GRASSES, A TURF ROOT


695
0:50:5,67 --> 0:50:9,33
SYSTEM, WHEREAS IN THE CASE OF EUDICOTS YOU
OFTEN GET, OFTEN GET


696
0:50:9,33 --> 0:50:14,47
A DEEP TAPROOT. OKAY, AND WE'LL HAVE TO COMPLETE
THE REST OF


697
0:50:14,47 --> 0:50:18,87
THIS NEXT TIME. AND WE'LL GET INTO GERMINATION
AND DEVELOPMENT


698
0:50:18,87 --> 0:50:19,53
RIGHT AWAY.


699
0:50:19,53 --> 0:52:19,53
