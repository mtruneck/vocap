0:0:7,7 --> 0:0:16,4
Apocalypse
The Second World War


2
0:0:16,4 --> 0:0:40,7
Aggression (1933--1939)


3
0:0:40,7 --> 0:0:44,0
Berlin - 1945


4
0:0:44,0 --> 0:0:48,0
Europe has been freed from 
The Nazis' reign of terror.


5
0:0:48,0 --> 0:1:5,3
The Red Army is waging its final battles.


6
0:1:5,3 --> 0:1:8,4
Captain Joseph Prautof,
A Russian officer:


7
0:1:8,4 --> 0:1:11,3
<i> the hate ran so deep...</ i>


8
0:1:11,3 --> 0:1:15,7
<i> we wanted to end the war, and nighly 
that force that wanted to kill us...</ i>


9
0:1:15,7 --> 0:1:23,8
<i> finish it off, once and for all. </ i>


10
0:1:23,8 --> 0:1:25,7
Hitler's days are numbered.


11
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:28,8
He leaves his bunker for one final bit of 
showmanship,


12
0:1:28,8 --> 0:1:31,7
as seen in this propaganda film.


13
0:1:31,7 --> 0:1:55,0
Is there still a soldier, or a child, 
willing to die for him?


14
0:1:55,0 --> 0:1:58,3
The war left some 50 million dead.


15
0:1:58,3 --> 0:2:1,7
most of them innocent civilians.


16
0:2:1,7 --> 0:2:4,4
For the women of Germany, 
the ordeal would continue 


17
0:2:4,4 --> 0:2:8,0
even after the cannons have gone silent.


18
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:11,5
The book "A Woman in Berlin" is a 
deeply disturbing account


19
0:2:11,5 --> 0:2:23,5
of the Russians rape of 
German women in 1945.


20
0:2:23,5 --> 0:2:26,4
<i> They grab me and throw me down. </ i>


21
0:2:26,4 --> 0:2:28,7
<i> I'm lying with my head on the steps. </ i>


22
0:2:28,7 --> 0:2:33,5
<i> I see one of the soldiers keeping watch, while 
the other rips off my under clothes. </ i>


23
0:2:33,5 --> 0:2:42,5
<i> and brutally forces himself on me. </ i>


24
0:2:42,5 --> 0:2:45,9
<i> But then we'd say, better to 
have a Russian on your belly, </ i>


25
0:2:45,9 --> 0:2:49,6
<i> then an American over your head. </ i>


26
0:2:49,6 --> 0:3:2,7
This German woman was referring to the Allied bombers,
that pounded her city into ruins.


27
0:3:2,7 --> 0:3:6,5
The Kurfurstendam, 
Berlin's most fashionable avenue.


28
0:3:6,5 --> 0:3:10,1
13 years earlier, the showcase of Germany.


29
0:3:10,1 --> 0:3:13,5
A nation still plagued by crisis.


30
0:3:13,5 --> 0:3:16,3
A monument commemorating the millions of victims


31
0:3:16,3 --> 0:3:27,0
of the First World War.


32
0:3:27,0 --> 0:3:33,0
Marlene Dietrich is singing "The Blue Angel" in Berlin - 
Alexanderplatz.


33
0:3:33,0 --> 0:3:36,1
Thomas Mann is savoring his 
Noble Prize for Literature.


34
0:3:36,1 --> 0:3:41,3
in the shade of the linden trees, of 
Avenue Unter den Linden.


35
0:3:41,3 --> 0:3:44,1
Berlin is major cultural center of Europe,


36
0:3:44,1 --> 0:3:59,7
one of the most open and tolerant cities 
in the world.


37
0:3:59,7 --> 0:4:3,5
Then in 1933, all that changes.


38
0:4:3,5 --> 0:4:8,5
Through intimidation, demagoguery, and exploiting
the bitterness of the German veterans.


39
0:4:8,5 --> 0:4:14,5
Hitler and his armed malicious, like the SA 
with their hymn, the "Horst Wessel Lied",


40
0:4:14,5 --> 0:4:26,8
seized control of Germany.


41
0:4:26,8 --> 0:4:31,0
The Nazis take advantage of the fact 
that the German Left is splinted.


42
0:4:31,0 --> 0:4:34,3
And it even seems like Hitler 
with his raised fist,


43
0:4:34,3 --> 0:4:40,9
revolutionary salute, 
wants to get on *****


44
0:4:40,9 --> 0:4:43,8
German Communists take their orders from Moscow,


45
0:4:43,8 --> 0:4:47,2
which view the social democrats 
as the true enemy.


46
0:4:47,2 --> 0:4:50,4
No alliance is possible between them.


47
0:4:50,4 --> 0:5:2,9
So for the last time, German Communists 
sing "De Internazionale".


48
0:5:2,9 --> 0:5:7,9
Hitler comes to power legally 
on January 30th, 1933.


49
0:5:7,9 --> 0:5:12,3
Within a few months, his dictatorship 
is firmly in place.


50
0:5:12,3 --> 0:5:16,1
He becomes The "Fuhrer" - The Leader.


51
0:5:16,1 --> 0:5:23,4
His supporters rise and chant: "Heil Hitler!"


52
0:5:23,4 --> 0:5:27,6
However, not all Germans are totally convinced,
so again and again,


53
0:5:27,6 --> 0:5:33,1
Hitler hammers home his simplistic,
nationalist slogans:


54
0:5:33,1 --> 0:5:36,1
<i> Before us lies Germany </ i>


55
0:5:36,1 --> 0:5:38,7
<i> Within us Germany is stirring </ i>


56
0:5:38,7 --> 0:5:44,1
<i> Behind us, All Germany is following </ i>


57
0:5:44,1 --> 0:5:47,1
And he eventually wins more and more people over,


58
0:5:47,1 --> 0:5:52,1
for he has a remarkable power of 
persuasion over the masses.


59
0:5:52,1 --> 0:5:56,6
But what does Hitler want?


60
0:5:56,6 --> 0:6:2,5
In his book "Mein Kampf" - My Struggle,
He clearly states what he calls his mission.


61
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:8,5
Being one of the imbedded veteran of the First World War,
his mission will be to destroy France,


62
0:6:8,5 --> 0:6:12,8
to wipe out the humiliation of 
the Versaille Treaty of 1919


63
0:6:12,8 --> 0:6:25,2
that strips Germany of its army,
and part of its territory.


64
0:6:25,2 --> 0:6:30,7
Then, he wants to conquer what he calls 
"Lebensraum" - living space.


65
0:6:30,7 --> 0:6:35,1
Germany has a population of 80 million,
twice that of France.


66
0:6:35,1 --> 0:6:44,6
He wants to make Germany "The World Power" 
that it deserves to be.


67
0:6:44,6 --> 0:6:47,6
A pathological anti-semit,


68
0:6:47,6 --> 0:6:52,3
Hitler has also taken on the mission of asserting 
the superiority of the Germanic Arian race.


69
0:6:52,3 --> 0:6:56,7
menaced by the Jews.


70
0:6:56,7 --> 0:7:1,2
For him, the Jews were the 
cause of the Great War,


71
0:7:1,2 --> 0:7:4,3
German's defeat, inflation,
unemployment.


72
0:7:4,3 --> 0:7:10,7
The next war will be 
a war on the Jews.


73
0:7:10,7 --> 0:7:14,8
They will be sent to Dachau, 
the first concentration camp.


74
0:7:14,8 --> 0:7:25,0
Where Hitler locks up the anti-Nazis, 
the communist, social-democrats, 
75
00:07:39,103 --> 00:07:43,851
and all those opposed to the Nazi regime.


75
0:7:25,0 --> 0:7:29,3
Last lead, Hitler takes on the mission of bringing all 
German speaking people


76
0:7:29,3 --> 0:7:34,3
into the rights fold,
beginning with those of his homeland.


77
0:7:34,3 --> 0:7:37,4
The Anschluss: Austria's annex,


78
0:7:37,4 --> 0:7:41,5
and immediately submitted to the same 
reign of terror as Germany.


79
0:7:41,5 --> 0:7:44,9
With the opening of one of the infamous 
concentration camps


80
0:7:44,9 --> 0:7:48,5
at Mauthausen, near Linz.


81
0:7:48,5 --> 0:7:51,4
Which country will be his next victim?


82
0:7:51,4 --> 0:7:55,0
Neighboring Czechoslovakia, whether is 
a German population,


83
0:7:55,0 --> 0:7:56,7
the Sudeten German.


84
0:7:56,7 --> 0:8:2,2
But the country is recognized as an independent state, 
by England and France.


85
0:8:2,2 --> 0:8:6,1
The clouds of war gather.


86
0:8:6,1 --> 0:8:11,2
In Munich, temple of Nazism, 
an 11-hour peace conference is organized.


87
0:8:11,2 --> 0:8:15,3
On one side, Adolf Hitler who was becoming 
more and more frightening.


88
0:8:15,3 --> 0:8:21,9
And his ally, the Italian dictator, 
Benito Mussolini.


89
0:8:21,9 --> 0:8:27,1
Mussolini, the founder of fascism,
an indoctrination of an entire nation.


90
0:8:27,1 --> 0:8:39,6
From child to a Don,


91
0:8:39,6 --> 0:8:42,4
On the other side, the Western democracies,


92
0:8:42,4 --> 0:8:46,2
victorious but exhausted from the Great War.


93
0:8:46,2 --> 0:8:49,8
Neville Chamberlain, the conservative 
British Prime Minister.


94
0:8:49,8 --> 0:8:53,8
And the radical socialist French Premier, 
Edouard Daladier,


95
0:8:53,8 --> 0:9:1,0
want to save the peace.


96
0:9:1,0 --> 0:9:4,0
They end up accepting the unacceptable,


97
0:9:4,0 --> 0:9:7,4
They give up the Czech province of Sudetenland to Hitler,


98
0:9:7,4 --> 0:9:11,0
In exchange for his solemn promise to make no more claim


99
0:9:11,0 --> 0:9:17,6
on another European territory.


100
0:9:17,6 --> 0:9:21,5
But what is Hitler's promise worth?


101
0:9:21,5 --> 0:9:25,0
Just 6 months later, he invades 
the rest of Czechoslovakia,


102
0:9:25,0 --> 0:9:31,5
and enters Prague, accompanied 
by Marshall Hermann Goering.


103
0:9:31,5 --> 0:9:34,1
Goering, a former First World War 
fighter pilot,


104
0:9:34,1 --> 0:9:37,9
one of the founders of the Nazi party,
is now the Air Minister.


105
0:9:37,9 --> 0:9:42,9
And an ogre, trying to charm
the Czech children.


106
0:9:42,9 --> 0:9:48,1
Hitler no longer needs the excuse of 
reuniting German speaking people.


107
0:9:48,1 --> 0:9:51,8
The powerful Czech industry 
will be working for him.


108
0:9:51,8 --> 0:9:54,3
Why shouldn't he take advantage of it?


109
0:9:54,3 --> 0:10:0,9
The Allies let him get away with it.


110
0:10:0,9 --> 0:10:6,6
The U.S.S.R. is the last major neighboring 
power left to counter Hitler


111
0:10:6,6 --> 0:10:10,9
It assigned a mutual assistance treaty 
with France.


112
0:10:10,9 --> 0:10:14,4
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
is the official name


113
0:10:14,4 --> 0:10:18,5
of communist Russia, and 
its satellite republics.


114
0:10:18,5 --> 0:10:24,3
Manipulation of the masses in Red Square,
masked the ironfisted dictatorship of Stalin


115
0:10:24,3 --> 0:10:28,5
who’s also thrown million of poor wretches
into his labor camps,


116
0:10:28,5 --> 0:10:36,2
The Gulag


117
0:10:36,2 --> 0:10:42,6
Industrialization and forced militarization,
have made the U.S.S.R. a major power.


118
0:10:42,6 --> 0:10:54,5
Despite their fear of communism,
the Western powers rely on the U.S.S.R.


119
0:10:54,5 --> 0:10:58,6
Hitler is going to beat 
them to the punch.


120
0:10:58,6 --> 0:11:2,3
In the summer of 1939, in his Berchtesgarden chalet,


121
0:11:2,3 --> 0:11:5,8
with his Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
Joachim von Ribbentrop,


122
0:11:5,8 --> 0:11:11,1
he prepares a blocking maneuver.


123
0:11:11,1 --> 0:11:15,4
Hitler, who swore to destroy communism,
sends von Robbentrop, the Nazi, to Moscow


124
0:11:15,4 --> 0:11:24,2
to sign a history-making treaty
with his worst enemy.


125
0:11:24,2 --> 0:11:30,0
When Stalin's foreign affair minister, Molotov,
signed the Germano-Soviet Pact,


126
0:11:30,0 --> 0:11:36,4
communists are totally taken aback, 
like these French Party Members.


127
0:11:36,4 --> 0:11:41,8
It's August, 1939, and people in France 
are enjoying their first paid holidays.


128
0:11:41,8 --> 0:11:46,8
One of the major victories of the
Socialist Popular Front.


129
0:11:46,8 --> 0:11:50,9
One of the reasons behind 
this non-aggression pact.


130
0:11:50,9 --> 0:11:53,7
The Soviets answer that Stalin 
is playing for time.


131
0:11:53,7 --> 0:11:58,2
Letting Hitler and the Western powers
killed each other off.


132
0:11:58,2 --> 0:12:2,7
Perhaps, Stalin, who intends to grab the Baltic 
countries and part of Poland


133
0:12:2,7 --> 0:12:10,1
even has the illusion that he could share Europe 
with Hitler on a permanent basis.


134
0:12:10,1 --> 0:12:14,3
In 1936, the US Congress had passed 
the Neutrality Act,


135
0:12:14,3 --> 0:12:20,4
to avoid being dragged into 
European war once again.


136
0:12:20,4 --> 0:12:24,5
So, with nothing to fear either from 
the United States or from Russia,


137
0:12:24,5 --> 0:12:27,3
Hitler decides to wipe out what he calls 


138
0:12:27,3 --> 0:12:30,5
"the worst monstrosity of The Versaille Treaty"


139
0:12:30,5 --> 0:12:36,2
The Danzig Corridor.


140
0:12:36,2 --> 0:12:39,5
In 1919, German territory was cut in two,


141
0:12:39,5 --> 0:12:42,9
in order to give Poland access to the sea.


142
0:12:42,9 --> 0:12:47,1
Hitler decides to launch his invasion off Poland 
and recover Danzig.


143
0:12:47,1 --> 0:12:50,1
On September 1, 1939,


144
0:12:50,1 --> 0:12:59,4
At 5:35 AM.


145
0:12:59,4 --> 0:13:21,5
The first cannon shot of the Second World War,
is fired on Danzig.


146
0:13:21,5 --> 0:13:26,2
Hitler is convinced that the French and the British
will not take action.


147
0:13:26,2 --> 0:13:29,7
He had the two governments meet immediately,
and sent him an ultimatum


148
0:13:29,7 --> 0:13:37,3
demanding that he hold all military action 
against Poland.


149
0:13:37,3 --> 0:13:41,3
Hitler declares, "Our enemies are little worms,"


150
0:13:41,3 --> 0:13:47,2
and he adds, "Who wants to get bogged down 
in a world war for Danzig? "


151
0:13:47,2 --> 0:13:49,5
September 3, 1939.


152
0:13:49,5 --> 0:13:56,6
At 11 AM, The Ambassador of Great Britain in Berlin
delivers a declaration of war.


153
0:13:56,6 --> 0:14:1,2
At 5 PM, France declares war on Germany.


154
0:14:1,2 --> 0:14:4,6
Hitler can hardly believe it.


155
0:14:4,6 --> 0:14:8,2
German generals find themselves facing 
their worst case scenario:


156
0:14:8,2 --> 0:14:11,2
war, on two fronts.


157
0:14:11,2 --> 0:14:13,7
But the die is cast.


158
0:14:13,7 --> 0:14:18,2
Hitler unleashes the Wehrmacht,
The Armed Forces of Nazi Germany,


159
0:14:18,2 --> 0:14:29,2
onto Poland.


160
0:14:29,2 --> 0:14:35,5
Entering battle as if in a bygone age, the Polish cavalry 
charges the German tanks,


161
0:14:35,5 --> 0:14:53,3
and is slaughtered.


162
0:14:53,3 --> 0:14:56,8
Paris, the Gare de l'Est train station,


163
0:14:56,8 --> 0:15:1,3
Many of these men had shipped out from 
these same platforms 25 years ago,


164
0:15:1,3 --> 0:15:4,3
in a totally different atmosphere.


165
0:15:4,3 --> 0:15:8,1
In August 1914, they marched off
to war in high spirit


166
0:15:8,1 --> 0:15:11,0
with flowers in their riffles.


167
0:15:11,0 --> 0:15:13,8
But there are no flowers this time.


168
0:15:13,8 --> 0:15:22,4
And no riffles.


169
0:15:22,4 --> 0:15:27,4
Nobody wants to fight this war.


170
0:15:27,4 --> 0:15:31,5
4 million men are mobilized.


171
0:15:31,5 --> 0:15:36,3
Many of them are farmers.
France is still a largely rural country.


172
0:15:36,3 --> 0:15:43,8
They head for the German border on foot, 
with their officers following on horseback.


173
0:15:43,8 --> 0:15:52,6
Army's still rely heavily on horses.
And these are requisition surround the country.


174
0:15:52,6 --> 0:15:55,7
Motorization is not kept up.


175
0:15:55,7 --> 0:15:59,2
Gaston Chirac, a driver of one of these
outdated trucks,


176
0:15:59,2 --> 0:16:3,2
with solid rubber tires, recalls:


177
0:16:3,2 --> 0:16:8,3
<i> There was such a shortage of equipment.
we have one riffle for two per truck </ I>


178
0:16:8,3 --> 0:16:13,7
<i> We have one box of 10 bullets,
which we won't allow to open. </ i>


179
0:16:13,7 --> 0:16:15,7
<i> It was pathetic. </ i>


180
0:16:15,7 --> 0:16:18,5
<i> If we had what we needed, we'd have fought, </ i>


181
0:16:18,5 --> 0:16:26,1
<i> cause we're no a great friend 
of the "Bosche". </ i>


182
0:16:26,1 --> 0:16:31,6
The "Bosche" was a pejorative term for the German soldiers
during the previous war.


183
0:16:31,6 --> 0:16:36,1
They were also called "vert-de-gris", 
which in French means "field gray",


184
0:16:36,1 --> 0:16:44,2
the color of their uniform, which enable them 
to blend in with their surroundings.


185
0:16:44,2 --> 0:16:47,6
But just who are these soldiers?


186
0:16:47,6 --> 0:16:52,0
Let’s take for an example, one of these 
young German, marching as he sings:


187
0:16:52,0 --> 0:16:57,0
<i> "Our lag is waving before us, 
Our flag is a new age." </ i>


188
0:16:57,0 --> 0:17:5,1
<i> "Our flag is stronger than death." </ i>


189
0:17:5,1 --> 0:17:8,8
His name is August von Kageneck, 
he writes:


190
0:17:8,8 --> 0:17:14,3
<i> I thought that the military career was the right choice. 
My parents thought so as well. </ i>


191
0:17:14,3 --> 0:17:19,6
<i> My father would tell me: "At least there, you can still 
open your mouth and say what you like,  </ i>


192
0:17:19,6 --> 0:17:23,4
<i> and you don't have to do 
that Nazi salute. "</ i>


193
0:17:23,4 --> 0:17:30,3
In September 1939, August von Kageneck is still
training to become a tank commander.


194
0:17:30,3 --> 0:17:31,3
He writes:


195
0:17:31,3 --> 0:17:33,8
<i> My father who is a general was telling me: </ i>


196
0:17:33,8 --> 0:17:38,0
<i> The French have 40 divisions on the border,
we have 15. </ i>


197
0:17:38,0 --> 0:17:44,0
<i> All the rest of them are in  Poland.
500,000 men against 200,000.  </ I>


198
0:17:44,0 --> 0:17:51,9
<i> They outnumber us,
2 to 1. </ i>


199
0:17:51,9 --> 0:17:55,8
French Forces attack on September 7, 1939,


200
0:17:55,8 --> 0:17:59,3
4 days after declaring war.


201
0:17:59,3 --> 0:18:3,6
This offensive notched to show public opinion 
that Poland is not being abandoned,


202
0:18:3,6 --> 0:18:12,0
advances 8 km into the Saar region.


203
0:18:12,0 --> 0:18:17,2
The French army's cinema department shows off 
the spoils of war.


204
0:18:17,2 --> 0:18:21,3
Bicycles..


205
0:18:21,3 --> 0:18:48,503



206
0:18:48,503 --> 0:18:35,1
The Saar offensive stops there,
and degenerates into a series of skirmishes,


207
0:18:35,1 --> 0:18:39,6
raids by lead commandos, 
led by the hero, Joseph Darnand,


208
0:18:39,6 --> 0:18:50,5
who receives the citation of 
"Premier Soldier of France".


209
0:18:50,5 --> 0:18:55,2
Later, he will become one of the most rabid 
collaborators with the German.


210
0:18:55,2 --> 0:19:1,1
And eventually, he'll be executed after the war.


211
0:19:1,1 --> 0:19:8,8
The French army, in spite of its hero and its superiority 
in numbers, takes no further action, 


212
0:19:8,8 --> 0:19:12,2
General Maurice Gamelin
67 years old,


213
0:19:12,2 --> 0:19:16,6
is Commandeer-in-Chief of the 
Allied-Franco British Land Forces.


214
0:19:16,6 --> 0:19:18,3
For the French outnumber the British,


215
0:19:18,3 --> 0:19:32,8
who also thinks that this war isn't for real,
and it'll all be settled  soon.


216
0:19:32,8 --> 0:19:37,9
Gamelin himself has no desire 
to re-fight the war of 1914.


217
0:19:37,9 --> 0:19:42,4
He wants to avoid another blood bath,
at any cost.


218
0:19:42,4 --> 0:19:46,5
He considers that he needs 2 years 
save behind the Maginot Line,


219
0:19:46,5 --> 0:19:50,1
in order to re-arm the country.


220
0:19:50,1 --> 0:19:55,4
The Maginot line is the work of a former 
Minister of war, Andre Maginot.


221
0:19:55,4 --> 0:20:1,0
This complex of fortification was meant to stop 
the German enemy, once and for all.


222
0:20:1,0 --> 0:20:3,3
It took nearly 10 years to construct,


223
0:20:3,3 --> 0:20:7,0
and swallowed up 1,5 million 
cubic meters of concrete,


224
0:20:7,0 --> 0:20:11,2
and 150,000 tons of steel.


225
0:20:11,2 --> 0:20:17,5
All these ***** are linked together by a labyrinth 
of tunnels, 100 km of them.


226
0:20:17,5 --> 0:20:21,2
The line itself, stretch for 720 km,


227
0:20:21,2 --> 0:20:25,4
from the Swiss to the Belgian borders.


228
0:20:25,4 --> 0:20:28,8
The Maginot Lines ends on the foot 
of the Ardennes Forrest.


229
0:20:28,8 --> 0:20:33,4
The French military command thought that German tanks 
could never cross these extremely


230
0:20:33,4 --> 0:20:35,3
rough terrain. 


231
0:20:35,3 --> 0:20:38,0
The French didn't extend the line 
all the way to the sea,


232
0:20:38,0 --> 0:20:40,4
because Belgium before declaring
its neutrality


233
0:20:40,4 --> 0:20:44,4
was an ally of France,
and opposed it.


234
0:20:44,4 --> 0:20:49,8
This northern part of the France is man by a French army
and the British Expeditionary Forces.


235
0:20:49,8 --> 0:21:7,8
Later reinforced by Canadians, and troops 
from the far flunk British Empire.


236
0:21:7,8 --> 0:21:13,2
In Britain a popular song of the day was 
"The Washing on the Siegfried Line"


237
0:21:13,2 --> 0:21:17,3
<i> We're going to hang out the washing 
on the Siegfried Line. </ i>


238
0:21:17,3 --> 0:21:21,3
<i> Have you any dirty washing, mother dear? </ i>


239
0:21:21,3 --> 0:21:25,4
<i> We're gonna hang out the washing 
on the Siegfried Line. </ i>


240
0:21:25,4 --> 0:21:32,0
<i> 'Cause the washing day is here. </ i>


241
0:21:32,0 --> 0:21:36,1
The Siegfried line is the string of fortifications 
constructed by Hitler,


242
0:21:36,1 --> 0:21:39,3
facing the Maginot Line.


243
0:21:39,3 --> 0:21:46,9
The Germans don't attack,
they're still trying to avoid a second front.


244
0:21:46,9 --> 0:21:49,9
The French, nevertheless, 
takes some precaution.


245
0:21:49,9 --> 0:21:53,1
They evacuated the population of 
Alsace and  Lorraine


246
0:21:53,1 --> 0:22:1,4
to the region of Perigord and Charentes
in the south west.


247
0:22:1,4 --> 0:22:6,4
Strasbourg, a ghost town,


248
0:22:6,4 --> 0:22:9,0
abandoned by its population,


249
0:22:9,0 --> 0:22:11,7
emptied off its soul


250
0:22:11,7 --> 0:22:27,4
especially that of the synagogues.


251
0:22:27,4 --> 0:22:47,844



252
0:22:47,844 --> 0:22:35,1
On September 20,
Hitler orders the bombing of Warsaw.


253
0:22:35,1 --> 0:23:2,1
The city is surrounded,
but still holding out.


254
0:23:2,1 --> 0:23:6,7
The Fuhrer wants to strike terror into the hearts and mind 
not only of the Polish
 .


255
0:23:6,7 --> 0:23:10,4
but also the French's and British' as well.


256
0:23:10,4 --> 0:23:19,3
"This is what is in the store for you."


257
0:23:19,3 --> 0:23:21,6
The world is horrified.


258
0:23:21,6 --> 0:23:25,8
In New York, the bombing of Warsaw 
is up in lights in Time Square,


259
0:23:25,8 --> 0:23:31,6
and on the front page of 
all the newspapers.


260
0:23:31,6 --> 0:23:36,9
Franklin D. Roosevelt, The President of The United States
addresses the nation:


261
0:23:36,9 --> 0:23:40,7
<i> This nation will remain a neutral nation, </ i>


262
0:23:40,7 --> 0:23:47,6
<i> But I cannot ask that every American 
remain neutral in thought as well. </ i>


263
0:23:47,6 --> 0:23:53,4
<i> Even a neutral has a right 
to take account of facts. </ i>


264
0:23:53,4 --> 0:23:58,7
<i> Even a neutral cannot be asked 
to close his mind, </ i>


265
0:23:58,7 --> 0:24:2,7
<i> or to close his conscious. </ i>


266
0:24:2,7 --> 0:24:6,9
The bombing of Warsaw shows how vulnerable 
the cities are.


267
0:24:6,9 --> 0:24:9,7
Paris sets about protecting its monuments.


268
0:24:9,7 --> 0:24:15,7
and hides its museum masterpieces 
out in the provinces.


269
0:24:15,7 --> 0:24:20,9
The Champ de Mars, at the foot of the Eiffel Tower,
is dug full of bomb shelters,


270
0:24:20,9 --> 0:24:32,4
and there are frequent air raid drills.


271
0:24:32,4 --> 0:25:5,6
Gas masks are compulsory.


272
0:25:5,6 --> 0:25:12,1
Poison gases were used in the First World War,
and now, everyone is afraid of them.


273
0:25:12,1 --> 0:25:21,3
Even the horses.


274
0:25:21,3 --> 0:25:46,7
Meanwhile, Poland, is being ruthlessly 
carved up.


275
0:25:46,7 --> 0:25:52,7
As previously agreed with Hitler,
the Soviet have invaded the eastern half of Poland. 


276
0:25:52,7 --> 0:25:56,0
Here, German and Soviet soldiers are fraternizing,


277
0:25:56,0 --> 0:25:59,2
and in congruent side, to say the least.


278
0:25:59,2 --> 0:26:1,8
The Nazis hand out flyers that read:


279
0:26:1,8 --> 0:26:5,5
<i> The German Army salutes the Red Army 
of workers and farmers </ i>


280
0:26:5,5 --> 0:26:12,4
<i> which is always held 
in the highest respect. </ i>


281
0:26:12,4 --> 0:26:22,3
The Polish Army surrenders to the German,
and in the east, to the Soviet.


282
0:26:22,3 --> 0:26:35,1
Stalin then orders the execution of 
20,000 Polish prisoners.


283
0:26:35,1 --> 0:26:40,4
He wants to eliminated their leads of 
this country he intends to annex.


284
0:26:40,4 --> 0:26:45,6
4,500 Polish officers are executed 
with a bullet in their head,


285
0:26:45,6 --> 0:26:52,2
in the Katyn forest, near Smolensk, 
in Russia.


286
0:26:52,2 --> 0:26:56,7
2 years later, at the Kremlin, Stalin meets with 
the head of the Polish Government in exile,


287
0:26:56,7 --> 0:27:7,1
General Sikorski, who delivers a list of 
Polish missing officers.


288
0:27:7,1 --> 0:27:20,7
The Soviets deny any wrong-doing.


289
0:27:20,7 --> 0:27:24,9
In 1992, the president of post-Soviet Russia,
Boris Yeltsin


290
0:27:24,9 --> 0:27:30,4
will present the Polish president, Lech Walesa,
with the original order of execution,


291
0:27:30,4 --> 0:27:38,2
signed by Stalin himself.


292
0:27:38,2 --> 0:27:41,0
Stalin, by occupying half of Poland,


293
0:27:41,0 --> 0:27:45,2
is in fact, playing into the hands of Hitler,
who needs a common border 


294
0:27:45,2 --> 0:27:52,0
with U.S.S.R. to facilitate his plan, 
to invade Russia.


295
0:27:52,0 --> 0:27:57,1
Hitler and Himmler, the head of the SS,
will now take care of Poland


296
0:27:57,1 --> 0:28:3,2
by naming the Nazi, Hans Frank,
Governor General of the Occupied Polish Provinces


297
0:28:3,2 --> 0:28:4,4
who proclaims:


298
0:28:4,4 --> 0:28:13,3
<i> I have the power of life and death
over the Polish people. </ i>


299
0:28:13,3 --> 0:28:16,2
After the war, he will be tried in Nurenberg


300
0:28:16,2 --> 0:28:28,5
and hanged for crime against humanity.


301
0:28:28,5 --> 0:28:33,3
These gypsies, held in a pen,
are filmed by a German.


302
0:28:33,3 --> 0:28:37,0
For the Nazis, they are 'non-persons'.


303
0:28:37,0 --> 0:28:39,5
The women will be forced 
to undergo sterilization,


304
0:28:39,5 --> 0:28:46,3
because they "do not deserve to reproduce".


305
0:28:46,3 --> 0:28:50,5
The Nazis declare 'open season'
on gypsies.


306
0:28:50,5 --> 0:29:3,2
Hundreds of thousands will be interned 
in concentration camps,


307
0:29:3,2 --> 0:29:9,3
The ordeal of the Jewish people,
begin.


308
0:29:9,3 --> 0:29:21,4
The Nazis now have 3 millions of Polish Jews
at their mercy.


309
0:29:21,4 --> 0:29:25,3
Hitler is still uncertain about 
what to do with them.


310
0:29:25,3 --> 0:29:29,6
As long as the war is going well for him,
he considers deporting them to the east.


311
0:29:29,6 --> 0:29:35,5
or even shipping them to Madagascar.


312
0:29:35,5 --> 0:29:38,5
It's only when the outcome of the wars 
becomes less certain


313
0:29:38,5 --> 0:29:43,7
that Hitler and his accomplices unleashed
a frenzy of hate and murder.


314
0:29:43,7 --> 0:29:50,5
"The Final Solution".


315
0:29:50,5 --> 0:29:53,5
For the time being, the Jews had to be identified,


316
0:29:53,5 --> 0:29:57,5
marked with the yellow star,
and herded into ghettos.


317
0:29:57,5 --> 0:30:5,3
Some of which, are completely
walled-off.


318
0:30:5,3 --> 0:30:9,7
From the diary of one of these 
unfortunate souls:


319
0:30:9,7 --> 0:30:13,3
<i> It's heart-rending to see the shameful 
scenes of violence that take place </ i>


320
0:30:13,3 --> 0:30:15,1
<i> before our eyes. </ i>


321
0:30:15,1 --> 0:30:20,3
<i> Women and the elderly, beaten right out 
in the street by petty thugs. </ i>


322
0:30:20,3 --> 0:30:23,1
<i> Tears come to my eyes. </ i>


323
0:30:23,1 --> 0:30:26,5
<i> All our powerlessness,  </ i>


324
0:30:26,5 --> 0:30:31,3
<i> all our isolation is there to see right in the open 
where not a single person takes on offence. </ i>


325
0:30:31,3 --> 0:30:38,0
<i> We are so weak. </ i>


326
0:30:38,0 --> 0:30:41,8
All the major cities of Poland 
will have their ghetto prisons


327
0:30:41,8 --> 0:30:50,2
where German, Austrian, and Czech Jews
will also be interned.


328
0:30:50,2 --> 0:30:56,4
The Jews here still feel confidence that, perhaps someday, 
they'll be able to return to their home.


329
0:30:56,4 --> 0:31:1,0
They don't know that they will die 
of hunger and cold.


330
0:31:1,0 --> 0:31:7,2
They don't know that the show 
is about to begin.


331
0:31:7,2 --> 0:31:17,7
<i> Inhabited by Jew.
No Entrance. </ i>


332
0:31:17,7 --> 0:31:20,9
Warsaw, is in ruins.


333
0:31:20,9 --> 0:31:23,9
Hitler comes to be filmed
by a propaganda crew,


334
0:31:23,9 --> 0:31:35,9
seen here traveling in 
a car in the background.


335
0:31:35,9 --> 0:31:41,1
These victorious German soldiers march their goose step 
to the sound of the grenadiers' march.


336
0:31:41,1 --> 0:31:45,9
But they weren't too efficient 
during the Polish campaign.


337
0:31:45,9 --> 0:31:50,8
Poor preparation, a lack of fighting spirit,
and even cases of indiscipline


338
0:31:50,8 --> 0:31:54,1
are the points that the commander-in-chief,
General von Brauchitsch,


339
0:31:54,1 --> 0:32:4,2
dares report to the Fuhrer.


340
0:32:4,2 --> 0:32:10,5
Hitler is furious, but he is immune to doubt and 
orders the attack to the West to be prepared.


341
0:32:10,5 --> 0:32:15,4
An attack on the Netherlands, 
Belgium, and France.


342
0:32:15,4 --> 0:32:18,2
Some of his generals think its madness,


343
0:32:18,2 --> 0:32:22,6
some of them begin plotting 
to overthrow the Fuhrer.


344
0:32:22,6 --> 0:32:29,2
This is a crucial moment, the course of history
lies in the balance.


345
0:32:29,2 --> 0:32:35,2
November 8, 1939. 
Hitler narrowly escaped an assassination attempt.


346
0:32:35,2 --> 0:32:39,5
It's seems that he enjoys some kind of 
divine protection.


347
0:32:39,5 --> 0:32:44,9
When he attempts the funeral for the victims,
he's no longer the same man.


348
0:32:44,9 --> 0:32:51,5
His power over the army and the German people
has grown even stronger.


349
0:32:51,5 --> 0:32:53,1
He told to the generals:


350
0:32:53,1 --> 0:32:57,6
<i> My decision is irrevocable. 
I will attack France when the time is right.</ i>


351
0:32:57,6 --> 0:33:2,4
<i> I will be victorious,
or die in the attempt. </ i>


352
0:33:2,4 --> 0:33:7,4
Yet, Hitler is still uncertain about attacking the West,
for he also says:


353
0:33:7,4 --> 0:33:11,0
<i> War is like opening the door on a dark room. </ i>


354
0:33:11,0 --> 0:33:18,0
<i> You'll never know what will happen. </ i>


355
0:33:18,0 --> 0:33:22,8
Eventually, he postpones the order on the attack,
and goes back to his chalet in the Alps


356
0:33:22,8 --> 0:33:31,4
to join his mistress, Eva Braun.


357
0:33:31,4 --> 0:33:34,4
She shot this footage of Hitler entourage


358
0:33:34,4 --> 0:33:40,1
of the Reich's architect, Albert Speer,
who goes for a long walk with Hitler.


359
0:33:40,1 --> 0:33:42,2
Speer recalls:


360
0:33:42,2 --> 0:33:46,1
<i> Hitler wanted to re-christened Berlin,
Germania. </ I>


361
0:33:46,1 --> 0:33:49,6
<i> We already had a mark up of the future,
Adolf Hitler Square </ i>


362
0:33:49,6 --> 0:33:53,4
<i> with a dome, 
inspired by St. Peter's in Rome, </ i>


363
0:33:53,4 --> 0:33:56,5
<i> but 17 times bigger. </ i>


364
0:33:56,5 --> 0:34:1,0
<i> I said to him, "My Fuhrer, wouldn't that
make an ideal target for bombers? </ i>


365
0:34:1,0 --> 0:34:4,1
<i> He answered:
Not at all. Goering has assured me that </ i>


366
0:34:4,1 --> 0:34:12,8
<i> no enemy aircraft will ever fly 
over the Reich. </ i>


367
0:34:12,8 --> 0:34:18,1
From his barrack, the future German officer, 
August von Kageneck, writes to his mother:


368
0:34:18,1 --> 0:34:22,2
<i> We are all eager to fight. 
We are ready for battle.</ I>


369
0:34:22,2 --> 0:34:23,7
His mother answers:


370
0:34:23,7 --> 0:34:34,3
<i> This war is a crime, and we are going 
to have to pay for it. </ i>


371
0:34:34,3 --> 0:34:37,1
The war then enters a new bizarre face,


372
0:34:37,1 --> 0:34:44,6
The Germans call it the "Sitzkrieg",
"the sitting war".


373
0:34:44,6 --> 0:34:50,7
The British call it the "phoney war", 


374
0:34:50,7 --> 0:35:0,4
and for the French, it's "Drole de Guerre", 
"the funny war".


375
0:35:0,4 --> 0:35:5,2
A long, strange waiting period,
especially hard on the women.


376
0:35:5,2 --> 0:35:24,0
For them there's not only the anguish of war,
but also the survival of their family to worry about.


377
0:35:24,0 --> 0:35:32,0
As in the last war, the soldiers dig in
and try to make the best of things.


378
0:35:32,0 --> 0:35:34,8
The French soldier, Gaston Chirac,
writes to his wife:


379
0:35:34,8 --> 0:35:39,6
<i> It's 30 degrees below zero,
the bread is frozen. </ I>


380
0:35:39,6 --> 0:36:45,1
<i> I'm one of the lucky ones. They gave us some straw, 
and with that, we can sleep better. </ i>


381
0:36:45,1 --> 0:36:50,9
The winter of 1939-1940 is indeed 
one of the coldest of the century .


382
0:36:50,9 --> 0:37:30,9
To make a bad situation worst, all the winters of this war, 
will be brutally cold.


383
0:37:30,9 --> 0:37:36,0
The commander-in-chief, General Gamelin, 
is expecting the Germans to attack through Belgium


384
0:37:36,0 --> 0:37:41,9
and move towards Paris across 
this open plain, like in 1914.


385
0:37:41,9 --> 0:37:48,9
Gamelin plans to make his stand against 
the German, on Belgium soil.


386
0:37:48,9 --> 0:37:53,1
In France, Colonel de Gaulle, a tank officer,
who is beginning to make a name for himself 


387
0:37:53,1 --> 0:37:56,2
criticizes this strategy.


388
0:37:56,2 --> 0:37:59,3
He calls it the "Maginot Lines Mentality"


389
0:37:59,3 --> 0:38:4,0
which consist in waiting for the other side 
to make a move.


390
0:38:4,0 --> 0:38:6,4
It is booked towards the professional army.


391
0:38:6,4 --> 0:38:12,8
He argues in favor of taking the offensive,
making massive use of tanks.


392
0:38:12,8 --> 0:38:15,6
France is producing 300 tanks a month,


393
0:38:15,6 --> 0:38:28,8
but they're being disperse in all the sections
to back up the infantry.


394
0:38:28,8 --> 0:38:32,4
French aviation has also fallen behind.


395
0:38:32,4 --> 0:38:36,1
France ordered 4,000 planes 
from the United States.


396
0:38:36,1 --> 0:38:40,9
Inspired the ever growing isolationist trend
championed by Charles Lindbergh,


397
0:38:40,9 --> 0:38:43,9
the hero who made the first 
Trans Atlantic solo flight


398
0:38:43,9 --> 0:38:49,4
and now a leading proponent of 
the "America First" movement.


399
0:38:49,4 --> 0:38:54,0
<i> If you believe in an independent destiny 
for America, </ i>


400
0:38:54,0 --> 0:38:59,0
<i> if you believe that this country 
should not enter the war in Europe, </ i>


401
0:38:59,0 --> 0:39:4,7
<i> we ask you to join the America First Committee 
in its stand. </ i>


402
0:39:4,7 --> 0:39:7,5
It's the isolationists'
voice of America


403
0:39:7,5 --> 0:39:15,7
and, of public personalities like Henry Ford,
the anti-Semitic car maker,


404
0:39:15,7 --> 0:39:21,3
or like Joseph Kennedy, America's ambassador in London,
who is anti war.


405
0:39:21,3 --> 0:39:30,5
Whereas his son, John 'the future president' Kennedy,
supports European democracies.


406
0:39:30,5 --> 0:39:35,0
Nazi sympathizers in America also 
contribute to the impassion climate 


407
0:39:35,0 --> 0:39:40,0
that reigns at the beginning of 1940.


408
0:39:40,0 --> 0:39:43,9
In Europe, The British Union of Fascist 
are also quite active


409
0:39:43,9 --> 0:39:46,9
up to the moment they're banned.


410
0:39:46,9 --> 0:39:52,7
Oswald Mosley, "The English Fuhrer", challenges 
the government, right in the center of London.


411
0:39:52,7 --> 0:40:6,1
He'll spend the next several years
in prison.


412
0:40:6,1 --> 0:40:14,6
Mosley's speeches urge people to get out 
on the streets, and stop the war.


413
0:40:14,6 --> 0:40:18,8
But Winston Churchill has taken the reins 
of the British government.


414
0:40:18,8 --> 0:40:22,9
Here, we see him with French general Gamelin, 
and Admiral Darlan


415
0:40:22,9 --> 0:40:29,8
who are on an unofficial visit 
to London.


416
0:40:29,8 --> 0:40:33,9
A Franco-British Expedition Recon,
is formed to help Finland


417
0:40:33,9 --> 0:40:40,4
which is being invaded 
by the Soviet Union.


418
0:40:40,4 --> 0:40:47,1
France is preparing to send its elite soldiers,
The French Foreign Legion.


419
0:40:47,1 --> 0:40:53,9
For a century it has been taking in the world's reprobates, 
no matter what their past.  


420
0:40:53,9 --> 0:41:0,3
As long as it's not too 'shady'


421
0:41:0,3 --> 0:41:3,4
Their headquarters, in Sidi Bel Abbes, 
in Algeria 


422
0:41:3,4 --> 0:41:6,8
now signs up a good number 
of Spanish Republicans. 


423
0:41:6,8 --> 0:41:10,8
Having fled from their country, 
after Franco's fascists' victory. 


424
0:41:10,8 --> 0:41:18,6
They now eager to fight the Nazis,
who supported Franco.


425
0:41:18,6 --> 0:41:28,9
They all make the long trip 
to France.


426
0:41:28,9 --> 0:41:34,3
The Legionnaires embark at Brest, along with 
the well equipped "Chasseurs Alpins".


427
0:41:34,3 --> 0:41:40,1
A mountain corp, 
trained for action in the snow.


428
0:41:40,1 --> 0:41:44,5
But Finland and the Soviet Union
sign a peace treaty.


429
0:41:44,5 --> 0:41:50,2
A few days later, Hitler launches an offensive 
against Denmark and Norway.


430
0:41:50,2 --> 0:41:55,0
The "Blitzkrieg", 
The Lightning War.


431
0:41:55,0 --> 0:42:0,5
The Wehrmachts takes Oslo 
in 2 days.


432
0:42:0,5 --> 0:42:3,5
Hitler is seeking to protect 
"The Iron Route".


433
0:42:3,5 --> 0:42:6,0
Iron is indispensable to 
the German war effort,


434
0:42:6,0 --> 0:42:19,4
and 50 percent of it Swedish iron ore is shipped 
out of the Norwegian port of Narvik.


435
0:42:19,4 --> 0:42:27,6
The Franco-British Expedition Recon 
lands in the 'feoffee' of Narvik.


436
0:42:27,6 --> 0:42:31,0
After a month of fighting, 
The Allies take Narvik.


437
0:42:31,0 --> 0:42:40,4
The Iron Route is temporarily cut.


438
0:42:40,4 --> 0:42:44,6
This victory is good for French morale
and adds credence to their motto:


439
0:42:44,6 --> 0:42:48,5
<i> We will win because we are the strongest. </ i>


440
0:42:48,5 --> 0:42:51,5
But the expedition recon will
have to abandon Narvik,


441
0:42:51,5 --> 0:42:56,4
and for the rest of the war, train load after 
train load of Swedish iron ore


442
0:42:56,4 --> 0:42:59,9
will feed the German war machines.


443
0:42:59,9 --> 0:43:1,9
The French are brought 
back home


444
0:43:1,9 --> 0:43:9,6
for the Germans have just launched 
their offensive in the West.


445
0:43:9,6 --> 0:43:16,1
May 9, 1940, Hitler left Berlin on his private train, 
code name "Amerika".


446
0:43:16,1 --> 0:43:20,5
Heading west towards new headquarter 
near the French border.


447
0:43:20,5 --> 0:43:22,2
Hitler announces: 


448
0:43:22,2 --> 0:43:32,3
<i> Gentlemen, the offensive has just begun. </ i>


449
0:43:32,3 --> 0:43:36,7
His generals has submitted him their battle plan 
during the winter.


450
0:43:36,7 --> 0:43:42,6
It looks similar to that of 1914,
attack through Belgium.


451
0:43:42,6 --> 0:43:46,5
But Hitler preferred General von Manstein's idea.


452
0:43:46,5 --> 0:43:52,0
Cutting straight through the Ardenne forest,
and swinging up and driving towards the sea,


453
0:43:52,0 --> 0:43:56,6
encircling the allies, 
with a circle cut movement.


454
0:43:56,6 --> 0:43:59,9
But this circle-cut movement is, in fact,
a huge gamble.


455
0:43:59,9 --> 0:44:4,0
Because the Ally could turn back
and counter attack.


456
0:44:4,0 --> 0:44:7,6
However, Hitler is confident.
He notes:


457
0:44:7,6 --> 0:44:16,3
<i> The main thing is to have a good weather. </ i>


458
0:44:16,3 --> 0:44:19,2
Lieutenant August von Kageneck claims:


459
0:44:19,2 --> 0:44:23,8
<i> We are the Wehrmacht,
the armed forces of greater Germany. </ i>


460
0:44:23,8 --> 0:44:49,4
<i> Victory is certain. </ i>


461
0:44:49,4 --> 0:44:53,4
For the German soldiers,
their homeland is in danger.


462
0:44:53,4 --> 0:44:59,3
After all it was the French
who declared war on Germany.


463
0:44:59,3 --> 0:45:6,2
May 10, 1940. At dawn, German parachuters 
make a jump over Holland.


464
0:45:6,2 --> 0:45:11,6
Their mission is to capture the air fields 
and bridges around Rotterdam.


465
0:45:11,6 --> 0:45:22,7
At the same time, Hitler unleashes 
his war machines on Belgium.


466
0:45:22,7 --> 0:45:26,2
Hitler waits.


467
0:45:26,2 --> 0:47:26,2
Will The Allies fall 
into the trap?
