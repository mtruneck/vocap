0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,752



2
0:0:0,752 --> 0:0:2,71
SETH ROGEN: First, I
should answer the question


3
0:0:2,71 --> 0:0:4,8
I assume many of you are asking.


4
0:0:4,8 --> 0:0:5,74
Yes, I'm aware this
has nothing to do


5
0:0:5,74 --> 0:0:7,869
with the legalization
of marijuana.


6
0:0:7,869 --> 0:0:9,41
JACOB SOBOROFF:
You're used to seeing


7
0:0:9,41 --> 0:0:12,48
Seth Rogen in hysterical, and
somewhat juvenile, situations


8
0:0:12,48 --> 0:0:14,39
in film or on TV, but
you're probably not


9
0:0:14,39 --> 0:0:16,509
used to seeing him in a
suit and tie appearing


10
0:0:16,509 --> 0:0:18,3
before a congressional
committee to testify


11
0:0:18,3 --> 0:0:20,384
about a serious subject,
like Alzheimer's disease.


12
0:0:20,384 --> 0:0:22,466
Seth has a very personal
connection to the disease


13
0:0:22,466 --> 0:0:23,469
through his own family.


14
0:0:23,469 --> 0:0:26,1
SETH ROGEN: After forgetting
who she and her loved ones were,


15
0:0:26,1 --> 0:0:28,56
my mother-in-law, a
teacher for 35 years,


16
0:0:28,56 --> 0:0:32,49
then forgot how to speak, feed
herself, dress herself, and go


17
0:0:32,49 --> 0:0:35,96
to the bathroom herself,
all by the age of 60.


18
0:0:35,96 --> 0:0:37,22
JACOB SOBOROFF: How
disappointing is it that only 2


19
0:0:37,22 --> 0:0:39,45
of the 18 senators
on the committee


20
0:0:39,45 --> 0:0:40,83
showed up for Rogen's testimony.


21
0:0:40,83 --> 0:0:42,413
SETH ROGEN: Americans
whisper the word


22
0:0:42,413 --> 0:0:45,4
Alzheimer's because their
government whispers the word


23
0:0:45,4 --> 0:0:46,399
Alzheimer's.


24
0:0:46,399 --> 0:0:48,44
And although a whisper is
better than the silence


25
0:0:48,44 --> 0:0:51,56
that the Alzheimer's community
has been facing for decades,


26
0:0:51,56 --> 0:0:52,612
it's still not enough.


27
0:0:52,612 --> 0:0:54,57
It needs to be yelled
and screamed to the point


28
0:0:54,57 --> 0:0:57,12
that it finally gets the
attention and the funding


29
0:0:57,12 --> 0:0:58,64
that it deserves and needs.


30
0:0:58,64 --> 0:1:0,39
JACOB SOBOROFF: His presentation
was certainly informative,


31
0:1:0,39 --> 0:1:1,86
but, as you probably
expect, he was


32
0:1:1,86 --> 0:1:3,6
able to bring levity
to what is otherwise


33
0:1:3,6 --> 0:1:4,809
a very, very serious subject.


34
0:1:4,809 --> 0:1:5,85
SETH ROGEN: That's right.


35
0:1:5,85 --> 0:1:7,51
The situation is so
dire that it caused


36
0:1:7,51 --> 0:1:11,31
me, a lazy, self-involved,
generally self-medicated


37
0:1:11,31 --> 0:1:13,582
man-child, to start an
entire charity organization.


38
0:1:13,582 --> 0:1:15,4
JACOB SOBOROFF:
Rogen and his wife,


39
0:1:15,4 --> 0:1:17,17
Lauren, have created what's
called Hilarity for Charity.


40
0:1:17,17 --> 0:1:18,794
It's an organization
that raises money,


41
0:1:18,794 --> 0:1:21,41
it raises awareness, and holds
a star studded annual event.


42
0:1:21,41 --> 0:1:23,34
Last year they made
half a million bucks.


43
0:1:23,34 --> 0:1:25,3
You've probably seen Seth and
his wife talking about this.


44
0:1:25,3 --> 0:1:26,7
They have been everywhere
from Larry King


45
0:1:26,7 --> 0:1:28,61
to HuffPost Live, where
I actually had a chance


46
0:1:28,61 --> 0:1:30,7
to sit down with
Lauren last year.


47
0:1:30,7 --> 0:1:31,14
LAUREN MILLER: I'm
incredibly lucky to have


48
0:1:31,14 --> 0:1:33,96
such a wonderful, supportive
husband who was been not just


49
0:1:33,96 --> 0:1:36,75
good to Alzheimer's
personally, with my own family,


50
0:1:36,75 --> 0:1:40,11
but he's able to bring an
awareness to the disease


51
0:1:40,11 --> 0:1:41,63
that it unfortunately
doesn't have.


52
0:1:41,63 --> 0:1:42,18
JACOB SOBOROFF:
It really is cool


53
0:1:42,18 --> 0:1:44,34
when someone like this,
someone so famous, so funny,


54
0:1:44,34 --> 0:1:46,881
can use their celebrity to bring
such a big spotlight on such


55
0:1:46,881 --> 0:1:47,99
an important subject.


56
0:1:47,99 --> 0:1:49,93
Chances are you or somebody
you know has been affected


57
0:1:49,93 --> 0:1:50,555
by Alzheimer's.


58
0:1:50,555 --> 0:1:52,45
Even Charlie McDonnell
has a touching story.


59
0:1:52,45 --> 0:1:53,53
CHARLIE MCDONNEL:
Alzheimer's is something


60
0:1:53,53 --> 0:1:55,17
that has affected me personally.


61
0:1:55,17 --> 0:1:57,64
My granddad, Joe,
had Alzheimer's,


62
0:1:57,64 --> 0:1:59,61
and unfortunately passed away.


63
0:1:59,61 --> 0:2:2,2
Seeing him go through what
he did was hard for me.


64
0:2:2,2 --> 0:2:3,55
And that's just me.


65
0:2:3,55 --> 0:2:5,43
I can't even imagine what it
must have been like for him.


66
0:2:5,43 --> 0:2:6,49
JACOB SOBOROFF: There
are a ton of great videos


67
0:2:6,49 --> 0:2:8,49
out there to find out
more about Alzheimer's,


68
0:2:8,49 --> 0:2:10,4
about current research,
about treatments,


69
0:2:10,4 --> 0:2:12,217
and some really wonderful
personal stories.


70
0:2:12,217 --> 0:2:14,55
We put together a playlist
for you with much, much more.


71
0:2:14,55 --> 0:2:14,93
And you know what?


72
0:2:14,93 --> 0:2:15,495
Get involved.


73
0:2:15,495 --> 0:2:18,215
Go to hilarityforcharity.org,
or go down into the description.


74
0:2:18,215 --> 0:2:19,84
All the links you
need are right there.


75
0:2:19,84 --> 0:2:22,89
SETH ROGEN: I don't know if
you know who I am, at all.


76
0:2:22,89 --> 0:2:24,81
You told me you never saw
"Knocked Up," Chairman, so--


77
0:2:24,81 --> 0:2:27,43
TOM HARKIN: I will wager
this is the first time


78
0:2:27,43 --> 0:2:30,21
in any congressional
hearing in history


79
0:2:30,21 --> 0:2:33,82
that the words "knocked
up" have ever been--


80
0:2:33,82 --> 0:2:36,814
SETH ROGEN: Oi, you're not gonna
like the rest of this, then.


81
0:2:36,814 --> 0:4:36,814
