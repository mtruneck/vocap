(guitar, bass, ; drums

2
0:0:5,21 --> 0:0:9,21
(Carl Madsen)
The native grasslands and the
prairies of the plains states


3
0:0:9,21 --> 0:0:14,0
is a jewel
and a national treasure.


4
0:0:14,0 --> 0:0:17,19
(Jim Ringelman)
America's native prairie really
is a phenomenal resource.


5
0:0:17,19 --> 0:0:19,24
It's actually one of the most


6
0:0:19,24 --> 0:0:23,8
imperiled ecosystems
in the world.


7
0:0:23,8 --> 0:0:26,9
(Jim Faulstich)
We've lost just
tremendous amounts


8
0:0:26,9 --> 0:0:30,17
of native grass in this area.


9
0:0:30,17 --> 0:0:35,19
(Kurt Forman)
What we have going for us is
the partnership with ranchers.


10
0:0:35,19 --> 0:0:39,2
(Karen Kreil)
And the saying is, that
"Anyone can love the mountains


11
0:0:39,2 --> 0:0:48,23
but it takes soul
to love the prairie."


12
0:0:48,23 --> 0:0:51,14

This program is funded
in part by a grant


13
0:0:51,14 --> 0:0:55,18
through Ducks Unlimited, from
the MDU Resources Foundation,


14
0:0:55,18 --> 0:0:58,11
which is funded annually
by contributions


15
0:0:58,11 --> 0:1:0,4
from its member companies,


16
0:1:0,4 --> 0:1:1,23
MDU Construction Services Group,


17
0:1:1,23 --> 0:1:3,22
MDU Utilities Group,


18
0:1:3,22 --> 0:1:5,18
Knife River Corporation,


19
0:1:5,18 --> 0:1:8,6
and WBI Holdings, Inc.,


20
0:1:8,6 --> 0:1:11,13
and by the members
of Prairie Public.


21
0:1:11,13 --> 0:1:17,28
(guitar ; clarinet play soly)


22
0:1:17,28 --> 0:1:21,9
(female narrator)
One of America's
greatest resources


23
0:1:21,9 --> 0:1:24,12
is also one of its least
appreciated.


24
0:1:24,12 --> 0:1:27,17
That's why native prairie
is on the list


25
0:1:27,17 --> 0:1:29,27
of the world's
most threatened biomes.


26
0:1:29,27 --> 0:1:33,14
Native grass has been
disappearing in record amounts


27
0:1:33,14 --> 0:1:36,16
the last few years,
converted to cropland.


28
0:1:36,16 --> 0:1:38,26
The bulk of the conversion is
happening


29
0:1:38,26 --> 0:1:42,16
in the Prairie Pothole Region
of North and South Dakota,


30
0:1:42,16 --> 0:1:46,11
where there are the last great
remaining stands of grass.


31
0:1:46,11 --> 0:1:51,14
This is also the continent's
most productive breeding ground


32
0:1:51,14 --> 0:1:56,2
for waterfowl, songbirds,
and other wildlife.


33
0:1:56,2 --> 0:1:59,19
Nowhere are the grasslands
more intact in this region


34
0:1:59,19 --> 0:2:1,26
than that landscape called
the Missouri Coteau,


35
0:2:1,26 --> 0:2:4,16
which is kind of that narrow
hilly area


36
0:2:4,16 --> 0:2:7,27
that was kind of at the terminus
of the last glaciation.


37
0:2:7,27 --> 0:2:10,1
It tends to be poor soils,


38
0:2:10,1 --> 0:2:12,27
but it's an area that's also
very rich in wetlands,


39
0:2:12,27 --> 0:2:15,28
and it's that matrix
of wetlands and grasslands


40
0:2:15,28 --> 0:2:18,9
that attract waterfowl
to the region,


41
0:2:18,9 --> 0:2:21,1
provide the resources both
for food and for habitat


42
0:2:21,1 --> 0:2:24,15
for nesting in, and therefore,
they are the very best of


43
0:2:24,15 --> 0:2:30,9
the best habitats that we have
left in this part of the world.


44
0:2:30,9 --> 0:2:33,29
You could think, in Central
South Dakota,


45
0:2:33,29 --> 0:2:39,22
there is a tract of land that's
2700 square miles contiguous


46
0:2:39,22 --> 0:2:43,22
of largely native grass with
enough wetland densities


47
0:2:43,22 --> 0:2:48,8
to average 100 breeding
duck pairs per square mile.


48
0:2:48,8 --> 0:2:50,9
That's an incredibly unique
landscape


49
0:2:50,9 --> 0:2:53,7
that you can find
nowhere else on the continent.


50
0:2:53,7 --> 0:2:57,13
(Dr. Scott Stephens) The native
prairie areas with the wetlands


51
0:2:57,13 --> 0:2:59,29
are really diverse systems that
include


52
0:2:59,29 --> 0:3:19,22
a whole rich community of plant
life, forbs and flowers.


53
0:3:19,22 --> 0:3:21,24
(Mike Forsberg) Some of these
other landscapes


54
0:3:21,24 --> 0:3:24,2
that just knock you right
in the teeth


55
0:3:24,2 --> 0:3:25,24
as soon as you see them,


56
0:3:25,24 --> 0:3:27,15
Great Plains, these places,


57
0:3:27,15 --> 0:3:30,7
you have to really linger, you
have to get into 'em,


58
0:3:30,7 --> 0:3:31,29
you have to get to know them


59
0:3:31,29 --> 0:3:34,22
like you get to know a friend
and build that relationship.


60
0:3:34,22 --> 0:3:36,27
And it's only then
when you start to see


61
0:3:36,27 --> 0:3:38,27
how remarkable they are,
how important they are,


62
0:3:38,27 --> 0:3:46,5
and how valuable that they are.


63
0:3:46,5 --> 0:3:47,23
For the last 3-1/2 years


64
0:3:47,23 --> 0:3:50,26
I've been working on a book
on the Great Plains.


65
0:3:50,26 --> 0:3:53,1
And basically it's to put a face


66
0:3:53,1 --> 0:4:3,22
to the lingering wild
that's left.


67
0:4:3,22 --> 0:4:7,16
You can look down
at a square meter of prairie


68
0:4:7,16 --> 0:4:9,14
and spend an entire day.


69
0:4:9,14 --> 0:4:14,2
There is so much life,
and that life is all around you,


70
0:4:14,2 --> 0:4:18,22
and it's also at your feet.


71
0:4:18,22 --> 0:4:22,5
But you just don't see it
if you don't get into it,


72
0:4:22,5 --> 0:4:23,26
and I think that's the thing.


73
0:4:23,26 --> 0:4:26,22
It's the biggest conservation
challenge in the plains to me,


74
0:4:26,22 --> 0:4:29,18
if they can understand it,
then they can appreciate it.


75
0:4:29,18 --> 0:4:31,29
If they appreciate it, then
they can value it.


76
0:4:31,29 --> 0:4:34,23
And if they value it, then
they'll want to conserve it.


77
0:4:34,23 --> 0:4:37,29
It's not lions
and tigers and bears


78
0:4:37,29 --> 0:4:46,4
but it's every bit
as remarkable.


79
0:4:46,4 --> 0:4:50,12
(Carl Madsen)
The native grasslands and the
prairies of the plains states


80
0:4:50,12 --> 0:4:53,1
is a jewel
and a national treasure


81
0:4:53,1 --> 0:4:56,26
the same as the redwoods
of California,


82
0:4:56,26 --> 0:5:5,19
the Rocky Mountains,
the great rivers.


83
0:5:5,19 --> 0:5:10,12
(Karen Kreil)
Once I was introduced to
prairie, I fell in love with it.


84
0:5:10,12 --> 0:5:12,12
It has such a subtle beauty.


85
0:5:12,12 --> 0:5:14,11
I think that because of that,


86
0:5:14,11 --> 0:5:17,2
it's hard for people who aren't
from here


87
0:5:17,2 --> 0:5:19,1
to have an appreciation for it.


88
0:5:19,1 --> 0:5:22,23
They drive by the prairie and
wetlands at 75 miles an hour


89
0:5:22,23 --> 0:5:25,22
and think that it sort of
looks all the same.


90
0:5:25,22 --> 0:5:29,4
But if they stepped out of their
vehicle and took a walk,


91
0:5:29,4 --> 0:5:32,7
they'd see 250 species
of plants,


92
0:5:32,7 --> 0:5:37,1
150-plus species of birds,
including many migratory birds,


93
0:5:37,1 --> 0:5:40,1
insects, wildlife galore.


94
0:5:40,1 --> 0:5:41,17
(bird sings)


95
0:5:41,17 --> 0:5:45,12
I just feel such a sense
of place in the prairie.


96
0:5:45,12 --> 0:5:49,16
And the saying is that
"Anyone can love the mountains,


97
0:5:49,16 --> 0:6:9,21
but it takes soul
to love the prairie."


98
0:6:9,21 --> 0:6:14,29
(Randy Meidinger)
Across the hilltops here you can
imagine hundreds of years ago,


99
0:6:14,29 --> 0:6:16,29
the massive herds of bison


100
0:6:16,29 --> 0:6:19,24
that once roamed
across the prairie here.


101
0:6:19,24 --> 0:6:23,17
We have dozens of teepee rings


102
0:6:23,17 --> 0:6:25,22
scattered across the hilltops.


103
0:6:25,22 --> 0:6:28,15
You can just see where the rocks
were placed


104
0:6:28,15 --> 0:6:33,4
in circular fashion to hold down
the buffalo hide.


105
0:6:33,4 --> 0:6:35,4
There's also many wagon trails


106
0:6:35,4 --> 0:6:39,6
coming across the Coteau region
here that are still intact.


107
0:6:39,6 --> 0:6:41,18
That's part of our history where


108
0:6:41,18 --> 0:6:43,9
the pioneers and homesteaders


109
0:6:43,9 --> 0:6:45,8
came across the prairie here.


110
0:6:45,8 --> 0:6:48,9
And once you destroy
that prairie,


111
0:6:48,9 --> 0:6:50,12
you lose that forever.


112
0:6:50,12 --> 0:6:52,2
Certainly you can plant grasses


113
0:6:52,2 --> 0:6:56,17
and native grass and forbs
back onto the prairie,


114
0:6:56,17 --> 0:7:0,6
but it's taken 10,000 years
for Mother Nature


115
0:7:0,6 --> 0:7:3,21
to get these hundreds of
different grasses, forbs,


116
0:7:3,21 --> 0:7:8,12
sedges, mosses, and lichens to
be in the place that they are.


117
0:7:8,12 --> 0:7:15,15
(cicadas chirp)


118
0:7:15,15 --> 0:7:25,14
(piano plays softly)


119
0:7:25,14 --> 0:7:28,4
(Jim Ringelman) Just in the last
5 years,


120
0:7:28,4 --> 0:7:30,7
we've lost almost 400,000 acres


121
0:7:30,7 --> 0:7:32,28
of native prairie in North and
South Dakota.


122
0:7:32,28 --> 0:7:35,19
That's a substantial amount, and
if that rate continues,


123
0:7:35,19 --> 0:7:37,17
a large percentage will be lost


124
0:7:37,17 --> 0:7:39,19
over a period
of a couple decades.


125
0:7:39,19 --> 0:7:42,9
(a cow moos)


126
0:7:42,9 --> 0:7:45,18
(Jimaulstich)
We've lost tremendous amounts


127
0:7:45,18 --> 0:7:48,5
of native grass in this area.


128
0:7:48,5 --> 0:7:51,22
A real concern I have is


129
0:7:51,22 --> 0:7:54,14
the amount of true native grass


130
0:7:54,14 --> 0:7:56,16
that's being broke and
converted,


131
0:7:56,16 --> 0:7:58,8
and when I say broke,


132
0:7:58,8 --> 0:8:1,9
turned to farm ground and
converted to cropland.


133
0:8:1,9 --> 0:8:6,8
There's a real push for more
crops, grain crops are


134
0:8:6,8 --> 0:8:8,3
obviously more profitable than


135
0:8:8,3 --> 0:8:11,23
the average cattle operation
the last couple years.


136
0:8:11,23 --> 0:8:18,9
(a cow moos)


137
0:8:18,9 --> 0:8:21,15
(Harris Hoistad)
The threats to prairie
grasslands are significant.


138
0:8:21,15 --> 0:8:25,27
There's so many other economic
forces that are driving


139
0:8:25,27 --> 0:8:28,4
the whole grassland conversion
thing.


140
0:8:28,4 --> 0:8:31,24
The fuel prices right now are
driving people


141
0:8:31,24 --> 0:8:36,1
to break up prairie grasslands
to grow corn for ethanol.


142
0:8:36,1 --> 0:8:39,26
Not to say that ethanol's bad,
it's just that it's adding


143
0:8:39,26 --> 0:8:43,14
one more factor into that
equation that is causing people


144
0:8:43,14 --> 0:8:47,22
to take a second look and think
maybe I suld break that up


145
0:8:47,22 --> 0:8:53,26
and try and grow
some corn on it.


146
0:8:53,26 --> 0:8:56,18
Doug Goehring)
There's only so much margin
to work with


147
0:8:56,18 --> 0:8:58,24
on every acre, so ultimately
what happens is


148
0:8:58,24 --> 0:9:0,29
you are not squeezing enough
out of there


149
0:9:0,29 --> 0:9:3,19
to meet your family living,
to meet your cost of living.


150
0:9:3,19 --> 0:9:5,27
So those farms continually
got bigger,


151
0:9:5,27 --> 0:9:9,18
and there's a point at which
you have to determine,


152
0:9:9,18 --> 0:9:11,16
do you continue to grow,


153
0:9:11,16 --> 0:9:16,19
or what are you going to do to
try to make these things work?


154
0:9:16,19 --> 0:9:19,4
And there's some
tough decisions made.


155
0:9:19,4 --> 0:9:23,6
And the reality is about every
year things change enough


156
0:9:23,6 --> 0:9:27,22
that one year it might have been
somewhat economically feasible


157
0:9:27,22 --> 0:9:32,6
to have more cattle or to be
in a livestock operation,


158
0:9:32,6 --> 0:9:34,22
and the next year grain
production looks like


159
0:9:34,22 --> 0:9:36,14
it's actually
a little bit better.


160
0:9:36,14 --> 0:9:38,25
But it does come back
to this issue


161
0:9:38,25 --> 0:9:42,5
of what's my legacy going to be
when I leave this land?


162
0:9:42,5 --> 0:9:45,21
What are my children, what do
they want to do with this place?


163
0:9:45,21 --> 0:9:50,22
What are my intentions for it?


164
0:9:50,22 --> 0:9:54,3
(Kurt Forman)
What's different
in recent years is that


165
0:9:54,3 --> 0:9:56,14
the majority of the native
grassland loss


166
0:9:56,14 --> 0:9:58,25
is occurring in
the prairie pothole region.


167
0:9:58,25 --> 0:10:2,29
For example, the last 3 years
we know that 80%


168
0:10:2,29 --> 0:10:6,0
of the native prairie converted
to tillage agriculture


169
0:10:6,0 --> 0:10:9,1
occurred in the prairie pothole
region of South Dakota.


170
0:10:9,1 --> 0:10:12,21
Most people don't realize
that particularly for ducks,


171
0:10:12,21 --> 0:10:16,24
the majority of the birds
that we're interested in,


172
0:10:16,24 --> 0:10:20,2
including upland nesting ducks,
nest in grasslands.


173
0:10:20,2 --> 0:10:23,19
Songbirds, shorebirds.


174
0:10:23,19 --> 0:10:27,25
(motor rumbles)


175
0:10:27,25 --> 0:10:30,13
(narrator)
Each spring in the Dakotas,


176
0:10:30,13 --> 0:10:34,25
scientists evaluate what effect
the loss of grassland has


177
0:10:34,25 --> 0:10:37,14
on how successful
nesting waterfowl are


178
0:10:37,14 --> 0:10:39,22
at producing
the next generation.


179
0:10:39,22 --> 0:10:42,29
We found 5 or six nests today,
which,


180
0:10:42,29 --> 0:10:47,0
just in the short time we were
searching, was pretty good.


181
0:10:47,0 --> 0:10:48,25
This is good nesting habitat,


182
0:10:48,25 --> 0:10:52,6
thick vegetation as
a result of all the rain.


183
0:10:52,6 --> 0:10:55,22
Having the large expanses
of grassland make it easier


184
0:10:55,22 --> 0:10:58,28
for the birds to disperse
their nests


185
0:10:58,28 --> 0:11:1,26
and make it more difficult
for the predators


186
0:11:1,26 --> 0:11:4,26
that would search
for those nests to find them.


187
0:11:4,26 --> 0:11:6,21
(Kurt Forman) What we're


188
0:11:6,21 --> 0:11:8,12
interested in, bird production,


189
0:11:8,12 --> 0:11:10,29
bird conservation, is a strong
relationship


190
0:11:10,29 --> 0:11:13,17
between the patch size
of a grassland


191
0:11:13,17 --> 0:11:15,6
and that grassland's ability


192
0:11:15,6 --> 0:11:16,27
to produce ducks, pheasants,


193
0:11:16,27 --> 0:11:22,11
and a wide array of songbirds.


194
0:11:22,11 --> 0:11:25,2
(narrator)
In North Dakota,
when the eggs begin to hatch,


195
0:11:25,2 --> 0:11:29,9
researchers put bands on the
legs of hens and ducklings


196
0:11:29,9 --> 0:11:30,29
to follow their travels.


197
0:11:30,29 --> 0:11:34,19
(Jacob)
We've captured
a hen blue-winged here.


198
0:11:34,19 --> 0:11:36,16
We found her yesterday


199
0:11:36,16 --> 0:11:38,7
and marked her nest.


200
0:11:38,7 --> 0:11:40,22
We're leg-banding these birds


201
0:11:40,22 --> 0:11:44,18
and also putting nasal markers
on them,


202
0:11:44,18 --> 0:11:47,15
so that if a hunter shoots
this bird somewhere,


203
0:11:47,15 --> 0:11:50,1
or if this bird is found
or recaptured somewhere,


204
0:11:50,1 --> 0:11:52,14
that band number
is unique to that bird,


205
0:11:52,14 --> 0:11:54,5
and it can be reported,


206
0:11:54,5 --> 0:11:56,27
and then that will go
in this bird's data file


207
0:11:56,27 --> 0:12:0,2
and we'll know a little bit
about migration and also learn


208
0:12:0,2 --> 0:12:2,27
a little bit about
just how long these birds live


209
0:12:2,27 --> 0:12:5,17
and their survival rates
while they're up here


210
0:12:5,17 --> 0:12:8,15
on the breeding grounds
in the prairie pothole region.


211
0:12:8,15 --> 0:12:13,16
We're going to pull her nest
file up on our PDA.


212
0:12:13,16 --> 0:12:16,0
We have all the nests
entered in here.


213
0:12:16,0 --> 0:12:17,2
Once a bird is banded,


214
0:12:17,2 --> 0:12:20,25
that number is assigned to that
bird throughout its life.


215
0:12:20,25 --> 0:12:24,6
When they are in the uplands
incubating eggs,


216
0:12:24,6 --> 0:12:26,21
it's a dangerous time for them.


217
0:12:26,21 --> 0:12:30,3
A lot of hens
become predated by predators,


218
0:12:30,3 --> 0:12:33,15
and it's also
a stressful time for them.


219
0:12:33,15 --> 0:12:36,12
There's a lot of food available,
but you've got


220
0:12:36,12 --> 0:12:39,21
the demands of laying eggs
and preparing for a molt,


221
0:12:39,21 --> 0:12:42,14
so it's also a fairly physically
demanding time for them.


222
0:12:42,14 --> 0:12:46,21
And then on a year-to-year
basis, site fidelity,


223
0:12:46,21 --> 0:12:49,0
which is basically
how site faithful


224
0:12:49,0 --> 0:12:51,1
these birds are
in nesting locations.


225
0:12:51,1 --> 0:12:54,27
Some of these birds
we've been able to document


226
0:12:54,27 --> 0:12:59,14
over the past several years,
return to the same site to nest.


227
0:12:59,14 --> 0:13:2,5
We're particularly interested
in blue-winged teal


228
0:13:2,5 --> 0:13:5,7
because North Dakota
is the main area


229
0:13:5,7 --> 0:13:7,28
where the continental
blue-winged teal population


230
0:13:7,28 --> 0:13:10,18
comes every spring
to nest and reproduce


231
0:13:10,18 --> 0:13:12,8
and subsequently raise ducklings


232
0:13:12,8 --> 0:13:14,26
that end up
in the fall migration.


233
0:13:14,26 --> 0:13:17,27
We've got fresh hatched
blue-winged teal ducklings.


234
0:13:17,27 --> 0:13:20,6
These probably hatched
earlier this afternoon,


235
0:13:20,6 --> 0:13:22,26
and they've dried off now,
and we're


236
0:13:22,26 --> 0:13:27,11
going to put leg bands on these
not even day old ducklings.


237
0:13:27,11 --> 0:13:33,4
It's a female.


238
0:13:33,4 --> 0:13:35,1
Okay now
that they're all banded,


239
0:13:35,1 --> 0:13:37,1
we're just going
to take them back


240
0:13:37,1 --> 0:13:40,14
and put them back in their nests
and then cover them up


241
0:13:40,14 --> 0:13:42,13
so that their mother
can come back


242
0:13:42,13 --> 0:13:45,6
and uncover them and find them


243
0:13:45,6 --> 0:13:48,12
and eventually lead them
to the nearest pothole,


244
0:13:48,12 --> 0:13:55,24
where they'll begin feeding
and start growing.


245
0:13:55,24 --> 0:13:59,3
(narrator)
As the young ducks
are learning to fly,


246
0:13:59,3 --> 0:14:2,15
researchers in South Dakota
capture even more for banding.


247
0:14:2,15 --> 0:14:5,12
(Randy Meidinger)
This is an adult male
blue-winged.


248
0:14:5,12 --> 0:14:8,1
You can tell obviously
by the blue patch.


249
0:14:8,1 --> 0:14:10,5
Are we doing left foot?


250
0:14:10,5 --> 0:14:13,17
Left leg upsidedown
this year.


251
0:14:13,17 --> 0:14:16,1
Some of these birds
are pretty good travelers.


252
0:14:16,1 --> 0:14:18,2
We've banded
birds here


253
0:14:18,2 --> 0:14:20,12
on the Goebel Ranch in
mid September,


254
0:14:20,12 --> 0:14:22,8
and two days later,
they were


255
0:14:22,8 --> 0:14:23,28
harvested in early
teal season


256
0:14:23,28 --> 0:14:30,2
on the Gulf Coast, so they can
really move when they need to.


257
0:14:30,2 --> 0:14:35,12
(a duck call)


258
0:14:35,12 --> 0:14:41,7
(a duck call)


259
0:14:41,7 --> 0:14:44,8
(shotgun fires two shots,
a dog whines)


260
0:14:44,8 --> 0:14:47,27
(man) Fetch him!


261
0:14:47,27 --> 0:14:50,19
This is the Horseshoe Lake
Hunting Club


262
0:14:50,19 --> 0:14:52,11
here in Morehouse Parish,
Louisiana.


263
0:14:52,11 --> 0:14:54,6
Because of the type of habitat
we have,


264
0:14:54,6 --> 0:14:56,16
the type of food we have,
we typically see gadwall,


265
0:14:56,16 --> 0:14:58,1
also known as gray ducks.


266
0:14:58,1 --> 0:15:0,13
We shoot mallards and widgeon
and green-winged teal.


267
0:15:0,13 --> 0:15:2,3
(a whistle blows)


268
0:15:2,3 --> 0:15:3,23
The prairie pothole region,


269
0:15:3,23 --> 0:15:5,28
or the Missouri Coteau
of North Dakota


270
0:15:5,28 --> 0:15:8,28
is very important to ducks
'cause that's where they breed


271
0:15:8,28 --> 0:15:12,0
in the glacial landforms,
the water and very importantly,


272
0:15:12,0 --> 0:15:15,2
the grasslands of North Dakota
are what's critical to ducks.


273
0:15:15,2 --> 0:15:18,8
Ducks nest in the grass and they
take their broods to the water,


274
0:15:18,8 --> 0:15:20,2
and so that's
what makes it important.


275
0:15:20,2 --> 0:15:23,15
The average gadwall or mallard
or whatever from Louisiana


276
0:15:23,15 --> 0:15:27,11
will make its way back in March,
in that time frame,


277
0:15:27,11 --> 0:15:29,2
and then they'll breed


278
0:15:29,2 --> 0:15:33,1
and then they'll come back
to us to Louisiana in October.


279
0:15:33,1 --> 0:15:35,17
They actually spend more time
in the wintering grounds


280
0:15:35,17 --> 0:15:37,8
than they do
the breeding grounds,


281
0:15:37,8 --> 0:15:38,29
but again,
those breeding ground times


282
0:15:38,29 --> 0:15:57,16
are very critical
to the population.


283
0:15:57,16 --> 0:16:0,14
(Randy Meidinger)
This is an example


284
0:16:0,14 --> 0:16:2,29
of native prairie pasture


285
0:16:2,29 --> 0:16:6,21
that supported livestock for the
last hundred-plus years.


286
0:16:6,21 --> 0:16:10,12
And just this spring, they were
sprayed down with herbicide


287
0:16:10,12 --> 0:16:15,14
to kill the native sod
and soybeans were planted.


288
0:16:15,14 --> 0:16:17,15
(Harris Hoistad)
It's going fast.


289
0:16:17,15 --> 0:16:20,1
Technology has changed,
equipment has changed.


290
0:16:20,1 --> 0:16:23,19
It's so easy to convert prairie
into cropland.


291
0:16:23,19 --> 0:16:27,3
It used to be in the old days,
in the '40s and '50s


292
0:16:27,3 --> 0:16:29,9
that you had to physically
turn the land over


293
0:16:29,9 --> 0:16:30,28
with some type of implement.


294
0:16:30,28 --> 0:16:33,1
Now you can plant
right into the sod,


295
0:16:33,1 --> 0:16:36,2
and the corn and soybeans will
grow right through it.


296
0:16:36,2 --> 0:16:41,27
(fiddle ; guitar play)


297
0:16:41,27 --> 0:16:44,14
From the first sodbuster
that came here,


298
0:16:44,14 --> 0:16:46,29
he broke the prairie to grow it,


299
0:16:46,29 --> 0:16:48,24
so it started changing
immediately.


300
0:16:48,24 --> 0:16:51,0
And you can go back
to the Atlantic Coast


301
0:16:51,0 --> 0:16:53,13
when the pilgrims landed, we
changed things, for the better.


302
0:16:53,13 --> 0:16:56,11
For those of us who eat 3 meals
a day, we're glad it's changed.


303
0:16:56,11 --> 0:16:59,1
(Karen Kreil)
Grassland birds are
declining at a rate


304
0:16:59,1 --> 0:17:1,21
faster than any other
bird communities.


305
0:17:1,21 --> 0:17:5,1
So just from that standpoint
alone, it's a concern.


306
0:17:5,1 --> 0:17:8,25
But on the other hand,
I really like bread,


307
0:17:8,25 --> 0:17:13,3
I really like corn on the cob.


308
0:17:13,3 --> 0:17:17,13
(Doug Goehring)
Those farmers want to provide
a living for their families.


309
0:17:17,13 --> 0:17:20,21
They want to feed
a growing world,


310
0:17:20,21 --> 0:17:23,1
understanding that food security
means something.


311
0:17:23,1 --> 0:17:27,23
A country without its ability to
feed itself will be held hostage


312
0:17:27,23 --> 0:17:32,28
by every other country in the
world.


313
0:17:32,28 --> 0:17:36,7
(Karen Kreil)
It's going to be
an incredible challenge


314
0:17:36,7 --> 0:17:39,13
for both conservation
and agriculture to work together


315
0:17:39,13 --> 0:17:43,4
to find a way to ensure
that we have


316
0:17:43,4 --> 0:17:45,9
grasslands and wetlands
for the future,


317
0:17:45,9 --> 0:17:51,17
but at the same time, meet
our growing needs for food.


318
0:17:51,17 --> 0:17:55,17
(Carl Madsen) I remember
in the mid to early '70s,


319
0:17:55,17 --> 0:17:58,25
we had a big grain boom
at that time.


320
0:17:58,25 --> 0:18:3,6
We plowed up a lot of land
and said we got to meet


321
0:18:3,6 --> 0:18:6,19
this big market, we've got
to go-- that did not last.


322
0:18:6,19 --> 0:18:11,5
We were left with a lot of
fragile lands that were broken.


323
0:18:11,5 --> 0:18:13,1
Now we're looking
at the same thing,


324
0:18:13,1 --> 0:18:16,15
and we've got to ask
the question, will it last?


325
0:18:16,15 --> 0:18:20,26
And should we be making our
long-term plans


326
0:18:20,26 --> 0:18:22,27
to permanently
convert grasslands


327
0:18:22,27 --> 0:18:33,24
to meet this immediate
market demand?


328
0:18:33,24 --> 0:18:36,13
(Jim Faulstich) Between the
rocks, the potholes,


329
0:18:36,13 --> 0:18:41,15
we tend to be a dry area, it's
just more conducive


330
0:18:41,15 --> 0:18:44,27
to raising grass than crops in
the typical scenario.


331
0:18:44,27 --> 0:18:48,5
I guess my concern long term is


332
0:18:48,5 --> 0:18:52,12
that the way the production
costs are going up,


333
0:18:52,12 --> 0:18:54,22
mainly fertilizer
and diesel fuel,


334
0:18:54,22 --> 0:18:57,21
I question how sustainable
farming's going to be


335
0:18:57,21 --> 0:19:2,14
in the long run
on these marginal lands.


336
0:19:2,14 --> 0:19:6,11
(narrator)
A United States Government
Accountability Office report


337
0:19:6,11 --> 0:19:8,11
says federal farm programs


338
0:19:8,11 --> 0:19:11,12
may inadvertently be
encouraging grass conversion.


339
0:19:11,12 --> 0:19:15,18
The nonpartisan research group
says farm program payments


340
0:19:15,18 --> 0:19:20,14
provide a significant incentive
to convert grass to cropland.


341
0:19:20,14 --> 0:19:23,14
The report says federal crop
insurance in particular,


342
0:19:23,14 --> 0:19:27,3
takes most of the risk out
of raising crops


343
0:19:27,3 --> 0:19:29,13
on land less suited for farming.


344
0:19:29,13 --> 0:19:32,16
(Jim) When you can look at being
subsidized


345
0:19:32,16 --> 0:19:34,1
and have crop insurance,


346
0:19:34,1 --> 0:19:37,17
and you can get insurance on
grasslands as well,


347
0:19:37,17 --> 0:19:41,13
but a typical payment back
from insurance on grassland


348
0:19:41,13 --> 0:19:44,25
may be 2 to 3 bucks an acre,


349
0:19:44,25 --> 0:19:48,22
where on cropland
it may be 200 to 300.


350
0:19:48,22 --> 0:19:52,7
That's not
a level playing field.


351
0:19:52,7 --> 0:19:56,1
The good Lord put grass here
for a reason,


352
0:19:56,1 --> 0:19:59,23
and it's unfortunate
that the tables are tilted


353
0:19:59,23 --> 0:20:2,16
so far to the cropping side.


354
0:20:2,16 --> 0:20:4,22
Cropping is important,
we farm too.


355
0:20:4,22 --> 0:20:7,22
It's just that it's an awful
important ecosystem,


356
0:20:7,22 --> 0:20:10,8
not only
from a rancher's standpoint,


357
0:20:10,8 --> 0:20:13,28
I mean I don't think people want
to give up eating beef


358
0:20:13,28 --> 0:20:19,1
and the other products
that come from livestock.


359
0:20:19,1 --> 0:20:23,2
The question is how much grass
loss can we lose before the


360
0:20:23,2 --> 0:20:26,21
whole grassland based ag economy
doesn't remain sustainable,


361
0:20:26,21 --> 0:20:30,7
and then we see a wholesale
loss of it


362
0:20:30,7 --> 0:20:34,1
as there's no cattle barn to
take your cows to,


363
0:20:34,1 --> 0:20:36,12
there's not enough pasture
to maintain


364
0:20:36,12 --> 0:20:40,0
the large herds of cows
that we have now.


365
0:20:40,0 --> 0:20:42,25
And if we see that, we'll see


366
0:20:42,25 --> 0:20:51,9
huge detrimental impacts
on the wildlife population.


367
0:20:51,9 --> 0:20:55,1
(Brad Magness)
I have a concern,
not just because I'm a rancher,


368
0:20:55,1 --> 0:20:57,15
but because I run a livestock
auction market.


369
0:20:57,15 --> 0:21:1,19
When I see grass get torn up,
that's just that many fewer


370
0:21:1,19 --> 0:21:5,3
cattle that might have a chance
to come through my sale.


371
0:21:5,3 --> 0:21:8,29
So now along comes the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service


372
0:21:8,29 --> 0:21:13,8
and other donors and said
we want to reward guys for


373
0:21:13,8 --> 0:21:16,3
good stewardship of taking care
of the grass.


374
0:21:16,3 --> 0:21:17,28
So it wa't a hard decision


375
0:21:17,28 --> 0:21:21,1
because it really wasn't going
to alter any of our operations.


376
0:21:21,1 --> 0:21:25,29
(Harris Holstad)
The Magness family came to us
a couple of years ago


377
0:21:25,29 --> 0:21:29,5
and expressed an interest in our
grassland easement program.


378
0:21:29,5 --> 0:21:32,14
And they had a very, very nice,


379
0:21:32,14 --> 0:21:36,9
very, very attractive piece
of property in that


380
0:21:36,9 --> 0:21:40,4
over 95% of it was
unbroken native prairie.


381
0:21:40,4 --> 0:21:45,26
If you'll look off to my right,
you'll see a wetland there.


382
0:21:45,26 --> 0:21:49,0
And way back in the day,
I don't know


383
0:21:49,0 --> 0:21:53,9
if it was in the '30s or '20s
or when, with horses


384
0:21:53,9 --> 0:21:56,22
they dug a ditch across here
to drain that wetland.


385
0:21:56,22 --> 0:22:0,12
The Fish and Wildlife Service
filled this back in


386
0:22:0,12 --> 0:22:4,1
to where they feel that this was
the original grade,


387
0:22:4,1 --> 0:22:6,28
so that that will
hold water again,


388
0:22:6,28 --> 0:22:10,4
as opposed to just running on
and running on.


389
0:22:10,4 --> 0:22:14,8
And there's years that that's
the only feed you might have is


390
0:22:14,8 --> 0:22:17,21
in that wetland, so I'm not
opposed to preserving that.


391
0:22:17,21 --> 0:22:22,9
(a cow moos.

392
0:22:22,9 --> 0:22:24,21
(narrator)
Keeping the grass
in beef production


393
0:22:24,21 --> 0:22:26,22
is a key to protecting it.


394
0:22:26,22 --> 0:22:30,5
Cattle producers own the vast
majority of this region's grass,


395
0:22:30,5 --> 0:22:31,25
and wildlife and livestock


396
0:22:31,25 --> 0:22:34,29
do a good job of sharing
the same space.


397
0:22:34,29 --> 0:22:38,23
Helping cattle producers stay
viable will mean the grass


398
0:22:38,23 --> 0:22:42,17
will still be there for cows,
wildlife, and people.


399
0:22:42,17 --> 0:22:45,2
What we have going for us is


400
0:22:45,2 --> 0:22:47,13
the partnership with ranchers.


401
0:22:47,13 --> 0:22:51,2
We have estimates that there's
about 5-1/2 million acres


402
0:22:51,2 --> 0:22:54,8
of native grass remaining in
eastern South Dakota.


403
0:22:54,8 --> 0:22:58,29
Almost all of that is in
a grazing regime, so you have


404
0:22:58,29 --> 0:23:1,24
landowners, ranchers,
who have a vested interest


405
0:23:1,24 --> 0:23:4,16
in maintaining that grassland
for their reasons.


406
0:23:4,16 --> 0:23:8,3
And those are
the same reasons in many cases


407
0:23:8,3 --> 0:23:10,26
that we're interested
in that same landscape.


408
0:23:10,26 --> 0:23:13,29
Keep the grass
and the water in place


409
0:23:13,29 --> 0:23:16,8
for grazing
and for wildlife production.


410
0:23:16,8 --> 0:23:18,25
There's interest from landowners
to protect these areas


411
0:23:18,25 --> 0:23:20,14
that's sort of consistent


412
0:23:20,14 --> 0:23:23,2
with their view of how this land
should be used,


413
0:23:23,2 --> 0:23:27,7
and so they're interested in
protection of it via easement.


414
0:23:27,7 --> 0:23:30,12
Our science tells us these are
the most important areas


415
0:23:30,12 --> 0:23:33,6
for waterfowl and a whole host
of other wildlife.


416
0:23:33,6 --> 0:23:39,25
Really, we just need the funding
to sort of get that job done.


417
0:23:39,25 --> 0:23:42,17
Probably one of the greatest
feelings


418
0:23:42,17 --> 0:23:44,15
that I've ever had is


419
0:23:44,15 --> 0:23:47,2
to be able to do something
so positive


420
0:23:47,2 --> 0:23:49,28
and something that will have


421
0:23:49,28 --> 0:23:53,1
meaning for a very long time.


422
0:23:53,1 --> 0:23:55,25
(narrator)
Private donors are helping


423
0:23:55,25 --> 0:23:58,19
conservation groups
and public agencies


424
0:23:58,19 --> 0:24:2,15
work with landowners
to protect native prairie.


425
0:24:2,15 --> 0:24:4,29
(Karen Kreil)
It's about the future.


426
0:24:4,29 --> 0:24:7,2
There's no other way


427
0:24:7,2 --> 0:24:9,16
to look at things because


428
0:24:9,16 --> 0:24:13,3
we have a responsibility,
I think,


429
0:24:13,3 --> 0:24:15,2
to ensure
that all of our children,


430
0:24:15,2 --> 0:24:18,18
the children of the world
have wild places,


431
0:24:18,18 --> 0:24:20,24
they have grasslands
and wetlands


432
0:24:20,24 --> 0:24:24,26
so that they continue
to be able to recreate in them,


433
0:24:24,26 --> 0:24:32,2
to gain the benefits from them.


434
0:24:32,2 --> 0:24:35,6
(Michael Forsberg)
The land ethic Aldo Leopold
talked about.


435
0:24:35,6 --> 0:24:38,11
The soil has to be well
taken care of,


436
0:24:38,11 --> 0:24:40,25
the grass has to be
well taken care of,


437
0:24:40,25 --> 0:24:43,5
the water has to be well taken
care of


438
0:24:43,5 --> 0:24:44,27
and that will sustain life.


439
0:24:44,27 --> 0:24:49,6
And that means all life,
from the tiniest little insect


440
0:24:49,6 --> 0:24:52,2
to the most powerful species
on the planet-- us.


441
0:24:52,2 --> 0:24:55,2
When we start to lose wildlife,


442
0:24:55,2 --> 0:24:56,2
when wildlife
becomes compromised,


443
0:24:56,2 --> 0:24:59,24
and when the systems that
sustain wildlife


444
0:24:59,24 --> 0:25:2,18
become compromised,
that's the proverbial


445
0:25:2,18 --> 0:25:6,22
canary in the coal mine--
because guess who's next.


446
0:25:6,22 --> 0:25:18,2
(birds sing.

447
0:25:18,2 --> 0:25:20,28
(Carl Madsen) I hope that 40
years from now,


448
0:25:20,28 --> 0:25:23,7
we can say boy,
we were wise


449
0:25:23,7 --> 0:25:25,13
to hang on
to some of this


450
0:25:25,13 --> 0:25:30,9
because we really need it for
clean water, for clean air,


451
0:25:30,9 --> 0:25:32,15
for livestock production,
for wildlife,


452
0:25:32,15 --> 0:25:44,17
and for all the good reasons
that we have natural resources.


453
0:25:44,17 --> 0:25:50,29
(birds sing.
cicadas chirp)


454
0:25:50,29 --> 0:26:21,21
