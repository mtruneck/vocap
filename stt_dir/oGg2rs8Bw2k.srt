CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Want to kick off today
with a big hello to the students and teachers


2
0:0:4,58 --> 0:0:10,41
at JC Booth (ph) in Peach Tree City, Georgia.
Really enjoyed meeting with you on Friday.


3
0:0:10,41 --> 0:0:15,139
Delivering the Monday edition of CNN STUDENT
NEWS to you and classrooms all over the world,


4
0:0:15,139 --> 0:0:29,85
I`m Carl Azuz.


5
0:0:29,85 --> 0:0:35,629
New York City subway, closed. The New Jersey
bus and rail service, shut down. We just got


6
0:0:35,629 --> 0:0:40,51
word that almost 2 million public school students
are out today, and it`s all because of this


7
0:0:40,51 --> 0:0:46,649
massive storm system named Sandy. On Sunday,
it was a Category 1 hurricane. A lot of times


8
0:0:46,649 --> 0:0:51,8
with these storms, forecasters focus on the
center and where and when it might land. With


9
0:0:51,8 --> 0:0:56,28
Sandy, one expert said it might not matter
where the center is, because the entire thing


10
0:0:56,28 --> 0:1:1,89
is so large. And things could get worse. There`s
a cold front coming from the western part


11
0:1:1,89 --> 0:1:6,43
of the U.S. If that meets up with Sandy and
the two weather systems merge together, it


12
0:1:6,43 --> 0:1:9,31
could have a severe impact on the East Coast.


13
0:1:9,31 --> 0:1:14,57
Sandy is already being blamed for at least
60 deaths from when it moved through the Caribbean.


14
0:1:14,57 --> 0:1:19,7
Yesterday it was off the coast of North Carolina
and moving north. Predictions estimated that


15
0:1:19,7 --> 0:1:23,299
Delaware, Maryland and Virginia could get
up to a foot of rain.


16
0:1:23,299 --> 0:1:27,399
Governors all over the northeast declared
states of emergency to help make resources


17
0:1:27,399 --> 0:1:30,1
and money available to prepare for this storm.


18
0:1:30,1 --> 0:1:35,2
Our next headline takes us all the way across
North America to Canada`s British Colombia.


19
0:1:35,2 --> 0:1:40,93
An earthquake, and a pretty big one, hit there
on Saturday. And no major damage was reported,


20
0:1:40,93 --> 0:1:45,969
but the quake`s potential impact, where the
quake had threatened reached across the Pacific


21
0:1:45,969 --> 0:1:50,289
Ocean out to the Hawaiian islands.


22
0:1:50,289 --> 0:1:57,13
The sirens in this Youtube video are letting
people know about a tsunami warning. The concern


23
0:1:57,13 --> 0:2:2,219
was that the quake in Canada would trigger
a large ocean wave that would wash up in Hawaii.


24
0:2:2,219 --> 0:2:7,49
Now, that didn`t happen, and the tsunami warning
was canceled after a few hours.


25
0:2:7,49 --> 0:2:14,1
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? In order
to be U.S. president, you have to be at least


26
0:2:14,1 --> 0:2:22,48
45 years old. Not true. There is an age requirement,
but it`s not 45. Presidents have to be at


27
0:2:22,48 --> 0:2:24,68
least 35.


28
0:2:24,68 --> 0:2:32,19
AZUZ: Well, of course this year`s presidential
candidates meet that constitutional requirement.


29
0:2:32,19 --> 0:2:38,29
Barack Obama is 51, Mitt Romney is 65. With
the election just eight days away, we wanted


30
0:2:38,29 --> 0:2:42,98
to share a little more about the men running
for the Oval Office. Both of them are family


31
0:2:42,98 --> 0:2:48,299
men. Romney and his wife Ann have five sons.
Obama and his wife Michelle have two daughters.


32
0:2:48,299 --> 0:2:52,68
If you look back at where they went to school,
they started at almost opposite sides of the


33
0:2:52,68 --> 0:2:57,549
country. Obama went to college at Columbia
University; Romney graduated from Brigham


34
0:2:57,549 --> 0:3:2,239
Young. One thing they have in common: both
men have degrees from Harvard Law School.


35
0:3:2,239 --> 0:3:5,549
Romney also has a degree from Harvard Business
School.


36
0:3:5,549 --> 0:3:9,72
How about prior work experience? Mitt Romney
helped found an investment company called


37
0:3:9,72 --> 0:3:15,129
Bain Capital. He also helped organize and
run the 2002 Winter Olympics, and he served


38
0:3:15,129 --> 0:3:17,159
as governor of Massachusetts.


39
0:3:17,159 --> 0:3:22,1
Barack Obama worked as a community organizer
in Chicago. He served two terms in the Illinois


40
0:3:22,1 --> 0:3:26,14
State Senate, and he was elected to the U.S.
Senate in 2004.


41
0:3:26,14 --> 0:3:30,48
This is the second time that both men have
run for president. They were candidates in


42
0:3:30,48 --> 0:3:36,15
2008 as well, and they both made some history
along the way. In 2008, Barack Obama became


43
0:3:36,15 --> 0:3:41,909
the first African-American presidential nominee
for a major political party, and this year,


44
0:3:41,909 --> 0:3:47,909
Mitt Romney became the first Mormon to be
a major political party`s presidential nominee.


45
0:3:47,909 --> 0:3:53,269
President Obama and Governor Romney are both
aiming for the same number -- 270. If you


46
0:3:53,269 --> 0:3:57,39
want to win the presidency, that`s at least
how many votes you need to get in the electoral


47
0:3:57,39 --> 0:4:1,829
college. Jonathan Mann explains how that works
and what it could take for the candidates


48
0:4:1,829 --> 0:4:3,579
to reach that magic number.


49
0:4:3,579 --> 0:4:3,98
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


50
0:4:3,98 --> 0:4:8,23
JONATHAN MANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It`s nice
to be popular, but it does not win the White


51
0:4:8,23 --> 0:4:12,659
House. The national poll numbers show that
more people prefer Mitt Romney lately, but


52
0:4:12,659 --> 0:4:17,459
winning the presidency is not a popularity
contest. You have to win states, not just


53
0:4:17,459 --> 0:4:21,919
votes. And for Romney, that`s a problem. Even
though the poll numbers are moving his way,


54
0:4:21,919 --> 0:4:26,74
the color-coded CNN electoral map has barely
budged in months, and it speaks volumes. It


55
0:4:26,74 --> 0:4:32,3
still projects that Obama is leading in the
electoral vote with the blue states, comfortably


56
0:4:32,3 --> 0:4:37,169
in his corner. Romney`s safe states are in
red. Each state has a different number of


57
0:4:37,169 --> 0:4:42,81
electoral votes, though, based on its population.
And the thing is that whoever wins 270 electoral


58
0:4:42,81 --> 0:4:44,35
votes will win the election.


59
0:4:44,35 --> 0:4:49,37
That`s why the yellow states, the tossup states
are crucial. Polls in those states show the


60
0:4:49,37 --> 0:4:55,15
race is still too close to call. Romney`s
problem is that he needs to win most of them.


61
0:4:55,15 --> 0:4:59,53
Just this week, North Carolina turned light
red, showing that the state is now in the


62
0:4:59,53 --> 0:5:4,44
leaning Romney category. Romney has a slight
edge in Florida, so we`ll be turning that


63
0:5:4,44 --> 0:5:9,419
state red as well. He has high hopes for Virginia
and for Colorado. If they turn red too, he


64
0:5:9,419 --> 0:5:15,16
is still, though, 13 electoral votes short
of the 270 he needs to win. He`d have to win


65
0:5:15,16 --> 0:5:19,5
two more of the smaller states, or the big
prize, Ohio, to win the election.


66
0:5:19,5 --> 0:5:24,24
Now, resetting the map, there is more wiggle
room in Obama`s path to the presidency. His


67
0:5:24,24 --> 0:5:29,43
campaign is setting its sights on Iowa, Wisconsin
and all- important Ohio. Those three states


68
0:5:29,43 --> 0:5:34,419
alone could put him over the top. Any other
wins would just be extra insurance. But say


69
0:5:34,419 --> 0:5:40,25
Obama wins Ohio and Wisconsin, and loses Iowa.
Well, he wins New Hampshire, Romney wins the


70
0:5:40,25 --> 0:5:46,96
rest. Each candidate ends up with 269 electoral
votes, a tie. That hasn`t happened in more


71
0:5:46,96 --> 0:5:52,24
than 200 years, but it could, and if it did,
the newly elected House of Representatives


72
0:5:52,24 --> 0:5:54,81
would actually be the ones to vote to break
the tie.


73
0:5:54,81 --> 0:5:55,49
(END VIDEOTAPE)


74
0:5:55,49 --> 0:6:0,62
AZUZ: A tie for president. That might sound
unbelievable, but it has happened before,


75
0:6:0,62 --> 0:6:5,34
and it`s something we`re going to look into
more later on this week, so please keep watching.


76
0:6:5,34 --> 0:6:14,9
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can ID me.
I was established in 1789. I lead one branch


77
0:6:14,9 --> 0:6:20,139
of the U.S. government. I have one chief and
eight associates, who can serve as members


78
0:6:20,139 --> 0:6:24,229
for the rest of their lives.


79
0:6:24,229 --> 0:6:30,419
I`m the U.S. Supreme Court, to which thousands
of cases are filed each year.


80
0:6:30,419 --> 0:6:37,93
AZUZ: So let`s say you`re a college student,
you`re looking for ways to help pay for tuition,


81
0:6:37,93 --> 0:6:42,77
and you come up with a plan to buy some stuff
and then sell it to make some money. Sounds


82
0:6:42,77 --> 0:6:46,389
simple, but it might not turn out that way.
It`s the starting point for a case that the


83
0:6:46,389 --> 0:6:51,74
Supreme Court is about to hear, and as Joe
Johns explains, the decision could go a lot


84
0:6:51,74 --> 0:6:53,319
further than just college campuses.


85
0:6:53,319 --> 0:6:53,96
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


86
0:6:53,96 --> 0:6:58,15
JOE JOHNS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It`s a case
that could cause trouble for anyone who ever


87
0:6:58,15 --> 0:7:4,69
thought about selling an old iPhone or iPad,
donating clothes to charity, or even unloading


88
0:7:4,69 --> 0:7:9,27
junk at a yard sale. The issue about to be
argued before the Supreme Court is whether


89
0:7:9,27 --> 0:7:14,479
the original copyright holder on U.S. products
manufactured or purchased in other countries


90
0:7:14,479 --> 0:7:20,139
can control your ability to resell the product
once you buy it.


91
0:7:20,139 --> 0:7:24,69
Davis Klyonaga resells old products at this
eBay consignment store.


92
0:7:24,69 --> 0:7:26,509
(on camera): How much of this stuff is foreign
manufactured?


93
0:7:26,509 --> 0:7:30,8
DAVIS KLYONAGA, OWNER, DROP & SHIP: I`d probably
say 85, 95 percent.


94
0:7:30,8 --> 0:7:33,5
JOHNS: He fears the case could put him out
of business.


95
0:7:33,5 --> 0:7:38,16
KLYONAGA: I think it`s ridiculous. I mean,
I have known about it because it could affect


96
0:7:38,16 --> 0:7:42,199
my business so horribly, but I kind of pushed
it back, because I`m like, how could this


97
0:7:42,199 --> 0:7:45,52
possibly happen? The repercussions would be
ridiculous.


98
0:7:45,52 --> 0:7:50,729
JOHNS: Even libraries are worried that a legal
defeat could require them to seek the copyright


99
0:7:50,729 --> 0:7:54,629
owner`s permission before lending books printed
overseas.


100
0:7:54,629 --> 0:7:58,159
Andrew Shore represents a coalition of interests,
including libraries.


101
0:7:58,159 --> 0:8:2,289
ANDREW SHORE, ATTORNEY: The rule we`d like
to see is very simple. You bought it, you


102
0:8:2,289 --> 0:8:4,319
own it, and you could do with it as you please.


103
0:8:4,319 --> 0:8:9,479
JOHNS: Otherwise, Shore says, copyright owners
could demand a fee every time you try to resell


104
0:8:9,479 --> 0:8:11,52
almost anything not made in America.


105
0:8:11,52 --> 0:8:13,58
(on camera): Anything I`m wearing, would that
apply?


106
0:8:13,58 --> 0:8:14,479
SHORE: It`s got a copyright.


107
0:8:14,479 --> 0:8:15,74
JOHNS: Right. DVDs?


108
0:8:15,74 --> 0:8:16,58
SHORE: Yes.


109
0:8:16,58 --> 0:8:18,259
JOHNS: What else? Iphones?


110
0:8:18,259 --> 0:8:19,99
SHORE: Iphones.


111
0:8:19,99 --> 0:8:19,94
JOHNS: Computers.


112
0:8:19,94 --> 0:8:20,78
SHORE: Yes.


113
0:8:20,78 --> 0:8:21,62
JOHNS: Televisions?


114
0:8:21,62 --> 0:8:22,46
SHORE: Yes.


115
0:8:22,46 --> 0:8:23,3
JOHNS: Cars?


116
0:8:23,3 --> 0:8:24,139
SHORE: Yes.


117
0:8:24,139 --> 0:8:24,979
JOHNS: Jewelry?


118
0:8:24,979 --> 0:8:26,159
SHORE: Everything with copyright.


119
0:8:26,159 --> 0:8:30,39
JOHNS (VOICE-OVER): The copyright`s holders
and their lawyers say the rhetoric has gotten


120
0:8:30,39 --> 0:8:30,61
a little overheated.


121
0:8:30,61 --> 0:8:33,39
THEODORE OLSON, LAWYER FOR PLAINTIFF: You
know that you`re on the right side of the


122
0:8:33,39 --> 0:8:37,26
case when the other side, the best answer
that they can come up with is that the sky


123
0:8:37,26 --> 0:8:41,75
is going to fall. Garage sales, museums, and
that sort of thing, none of that is going


124
0:8:41,75 --> 0:8:42,18
to happen.


125
0:8:42,18 --> 0:8:46,51
JOHNS: Powerhouse attorney Ted Olson says
this is mostly about books and movies and


126
0:8:46,51 --> 0:8:52,7
other so-called intellectual properties, and
making sure producers of such works have exclusive


127
0:8:52,7 --> 0:8:54,12
rights to distribute them in the U.S.


128
0:8:54,12 --> 0:9:0,21
OLSON: It is protecting the integrity of the
copyright system in the United States, which


129
0:9:0,21 --> 0:9:6,48
was created by the Constitution in order to
create an incentive for people to create works


130
0:9:6,48 --> 0:9:8,98
that make us all laugh or cry or educate us.


131
0:9:8,98 --> 0:9:9,66
(END VIDEOTAPE)


132
0:9:9,66 --> 0:9:14,73
AZUZ: Finally today, there are times I`m very
glad I do most of my reporting from a studio,


133
0:9:14,73 --> 0:9:19,36
because the field presents perils, like when
this fish flaps and the field correspondent


134
0:9:19,36 --> 0:9:26,4
freaks. Only problem, her backup`s balance.
But it is more or less embarrassing than what`s


135
0:9:26,4 --> 0:9:29,82
about to happen to this reporter. The problem
with being out in the air is the birds, and


136
0:9:29,82 --> 0:9:35,7
one of them just dropped a present on the
reporter`s shoulder. That`s just a sign of


137
0:9:35,7 --> 0:9:40,4
disrespect. You word hard, toil at your job,
and then a bird does something to foul it


138
0:9:40,4 --> 0:9:43,6
up. If we keep this up, this show is going
down the tubes, so we`ll see you tomorrow


139
0:9:43,6 --> 0:11:43,6
on CNN STUDENT NEWS.
