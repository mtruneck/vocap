1
0:0:2,75 --> 0:0:8,879
The *second* bravest person who ever lived
was the first person to try a raw oyster.


2
0:0:8,879 --> 0:0:14,63
The bravest person was the first one to consent
to being circumcised. Today, some people routinely


3
0:0:14,63 --> 0:0:20,9
eat oysters, and up to 30% of the world's
male population have a part of their penis


4
0:0:20,9 --> 0:0:27,55
removed shortly after birth. The statistics
for Americans are around 70%, or as high as


5
0:0:27,55 --> 0:0:34,33
80% among European-Americans, and the rates
vary with religion and region. By contrast,


6
0:0:34,33 --> 0:0:41,23
the European rates are much lower, less than
20%, less than 1% in places like Finland,


7
0:0:41,23 --> 0:0:47,809
and in Muslim controlled central Asia and
the Mid-East, the rates are nearly 100%.


8
0:0:47,809 --> 0:0:53,68
The faiths of Islam, Christianity and Judaism
practice circumcision as a religious rite,


9
0:0:53,68 --> 0:0:59,469
an obligation of faith, and some African tribes
practice adult circumcision as part of the


10
0:0:59,469 --> 0:1:5,7
rites of manhood. The earliest record of circumcision
comes from ancient Egyptian art, and the Semitic


11
0:1:5,7 --> 0:1:11,21
peoples appear to have adopted the practice
long before the writing of scriptures, suggesting


12
0:1:11,21 --> 0:1:17,0
that wide-spread circumcision pre-dated the
Bible by thousands of years. Alexander the


13
0:1:17,0 --> 0:1:22,75
Great, a Greek Macedonian who was raised in
a non-circumcision culture, was said to have


14
0:1:22,75 --> 0:1:27,9
radically altered the traditional circumcision
practice of the peoples he conquered.


15
0:1:27,9 --> 0:1:34,369
What an odd thing for diverse cultures to
have adopted. I suppose certain early cultures


16
0:1:34,369 --> 0:1:40,619
might have associated foreskin with poor hygenic
practices. In some cultures, circumcision


17
0:1:40,619 --> 0:1:46,18
of young boys was probably a sort of coming-out
party for the genitals, a test of manhood


18
0:1:46,18 --> 0:1:52,32
as well. Some tribal cultures consider the
phallus to be a symbol of fertility or power.


19
0:1:52,32 --> 0:1:58,28
The act of modifying it has an effect on the
perception of the person. That cultural interest


20
0:1:58,28 --> 0:2:4,34
probably became codified in cults and religious
ceremonies, like ceremonial tatooing or ear


21
0:2:4,34 --> 0:2:10,869
piercing or many other body modifications
practiced by world cultures. The genitals


22
0:2:10,869 --> 0:2:17,69
have always been a religious obsession: up
to and including full self-castration by male


23
0:2:17,69 --> 0:2:23,26
priests of Cybele. (sib-ellee). So, although
we associate circumcision with certain religious


24
0:2:23,26 --> 0:2:29,629
groups, the practice seems to predate the
religion, and the cultural practice was co-opted


25
0:2:29,629 --> 0:2:33,51
by priests, rather than invented by them.


26
0:2:33,51 --> 0:2:39,4
I had no idea that male circumcision was such
a touchy subject. Growing up as I did in the


27
0:2:39,4 --> 0:2:45,18
American MidWest, circumcision was a normal
part of labor and delivery. When my wife and


28
0:2:45,18 --> 0:2:52,1
I were discussing our plans with our obstetrician,
we really hadn't discussed the topic together.


29
0:2:52,1 --> 0:2:57,849
In the end, we made a hasty decision to carry
on the tradition in my family: circumcision.


30
0:2:57,849 --> 0:3:3,68
Now that I look back, I regret basing such
an important medical decision on such casual


31
0:3:3,68 --> 0:3:10,78
thinking or lack thereof. However, I don't
think the issue is as clear-cut, pun intended,


32
0:3:10,78 --> 0:3:15,7
as it might appear at first glance. I want
to throw out a few issues that I've been thinking


33
0:3:15,7 --> 0:3:21,15
about. I hope you'll watch the full video,
tell me your thoughts on the topic, and hopefully


34
0:3:21,15 --> 0:3:23,67
start some useful discussion.


35
0:3:23,67 --> 0:3:29,45
My mind is far from made up on this topic,
and I confess the more I learn, the more complex


36
0:3:29,45 --> 0:3:34,879
are the issues and the harder it's been to
take a strong stand on either side. Sometimes


37
0:3:34,879 --> 0:3:39,48
knowledge is the enemy of confidence and vice
versa.


38
0:3:39,48 --> 0:3:45,92
1. Modern infant circumcision methods are
relatively safe and minimize suffering, but


39
0:3:45,92 --> 0:3:50,49
are not RISK-FREE nor painless.


40
0:3:50,49 --> 0:3:55,78
Most circumcisions are done in one of three
methods, the Plastibell, Gomco or Mogen clamps.


41
0:3:55,78 --> 0:4:1,549
All of them are relatively very safe, with
few recorded complications, but there ARE


42
0:4:1,549 --> 0:4:7,19
complications and risks. Not the least of
which is the risk of cosmetic or functional


43
0:4:7,19 --> 0:4:13,11
damage to the penis, minor or serious infection,
and bleeding or hemmorage. These risks are


44
0:4:13,11 --> 0:4:19,6
usually lowest in newborns. Older children
and adults who undergo the surgery are much


45
0:4:19,6 --> 0:4:24,21
more likely to have serious complications.
There've been numerous studies that attempted


46
0:4:24,21 --> 0:4:31,19
to quantify adverse events. If we simply include
any symptom, including redness or bleeding,


47
0:4:31,19 --> 0:4:38,169
the rates range from 2 to 40 percent, depending
on definitions. If the study only includes


48
0:4:38,169 --> 0:4:43,669
serious complications, which would be issues
requiring further medical care, the rates


49
0:4:43,669 --> 0:4:50,88
are usually around 0.2%. That's 2 out of a
1000 circumcisions where the procedure required


50
0:4:50,88 --> 0:4:56,24
additional medical care. Usually these were
a matter of bringing the baby back in to the


51
0:4:56,24 --> 0:5:1,94
doctor, or it could include an ER visit. I
couldn't find any recorded cases of deaths


52
0:5:1,94 --> 0:5:7,41
in my survey of the medical literature, but
I did find an estimate of 1 death for every


53
0:5:7,41 --> 0:5:15,44
500,000 circumcisions suggested by an opponent
of circumcision , Lowell King, in a 1975 report.


54
0:5:15,44 --> 0:5:20,24
I suspect that's a bit high, and includes
cases where the proximal cause may not have


55
0:5:20,24 --> 0:5:27,21
actually been the circumcision. Nevertheless,
there are risks, up to and including death,


56
0:5:27,21 --> 0:5:28,37
though they are very rare.


57
0:5:28,37 --> 0:5:36,889
2. There are some medical benefits to routine
infant circumcision.


58
0:5:36,889 --> 0:5:42,5
In some cases, removal of the foreskin is
medically necessary to prevent more serious


59
0:5:42,5 --> 0:5:48,68
pathology. We could call that medical circumcision,
but I'm talking here specifically about circumcision


60
0:5:48,68 --> 0:5:51,389
of boys as a routine practice.


61
0:5:51,389 --> 0:5:58,96
We can break the topics of benefits into three
categories: STD transmission risk, UTI risk


62
0:5:58,96 --> 0:6:3,259
and severity, and avoidance of rare conditions.


63
0:6:3,259 --> 0:6:11,5
Particularly the HIV risk argument must be
addressed. Foreskin is a favorite target of


64
0:6:11,5 --> 0:6:16,27
HIV infection. It is loaded with the kinds
of cells most easily infected, the Langerhan's


65
0:6:16,27 --> 0:6:22,669
cell, but not protected by a resistant layer
of protein called keratin. We would predict,


66
0:6:22,669 --> 0:6:29,69
therefore, that circumcised men without a
foreskin would be less likely to be infected.


67
0:6:29,69 --> 0:6:34,46
The process should also affect the ability
to transmit the virus, as microscopic openings


68
0:6:34,46 --> 0:6:39,729
in the foreskin allow the virus an easy exit
to the next host.


69
0:6:39,729 --> 0:6:45,63
That's the mechanism or theory behind protective
circumcision, how does that translate into


70
0:6:45,63 --> 0:6:51,83
actual protection? Well, the evidence seems
pretty strongly in favor, although there are


71
0:6:51,83 --> 0:6:58,289
some who disagree. In high risk populations,
like those in East and Southern Africa, it's


72
0:6:58,289 --> 0:7:5,319
very protective. We're talking about 60% or
more reductions in transmission. That could


73
0:7:5,319 --> 0:7:10,599
save millions of lives, and the public health
agencies that operate in the area, like the


74
0:7:10,599 --> 0:7:16,69
World Health Organization, are actively investigating
if the benefits outweigh the risks, and if


75
0:7:16,69 --> 0:7:22,34
circumcision clinics for adults are practical.
If we had an effective alternative for preventing


76
0:7:22,34 --> 0:7:28,669
the spread of HIV, if condom use and testing
were more prevalent, I would say this argument


77
0:7:28,669 --> 0:7:34,569
would be neutralized. However, at the present
moment, circumcision is very effective in


78
0:7:34,569 --> 0:7:41,24
these high risk populations. In lower risk
populations the HIV risk reduction is more


79
0:7:41,24 --> 0:7:43,44
modest.


80
0:7:43,44 --> 0:7:48,6
The protection doesn't just benefit men, it
also benefits women, since the protective


81
0:7:48,6 --> 0:7:54,8
effects are only detectable in heterosexual
transmission. By benefitting women, it can


82
0:7:54,8 --> 0:7:59,629
also prevent newborn children from being born
infected and that saves the lives of little


83
0:7:59,629 --> 0:8:1,55
baby boys.


84
0:8:1,55 --> 0:8:6,919
Similar effects and similar mechanisms have
been identified for several other STDs: genital


85
0:8:6,919 --> 0:8:13,91
ulcers, Herpes, Trichomoniasis and human papillomavirus
infection transmission are all reduced in


86
0:8:13,91 --> 0:8:19,94
circumsized individuals. Chlamydia and gonnorhea
transmission, on the other hand, don't appear


87
0:8:19,94 --> 0:8:21,58
to be affected.


88
0:8:21,58 --> 0:8:27,509
The papillomavirus infection is especially
important, as HPVs are associated with various


89
0:8:27,509 --> 0:8:35,0
cancers, most especially of the cervix, where
it's implicated in nearly 100% of cases. Worldwide,


90
0:8:35,0 --> 0:8:42,61
cervical cancer is estimated to affect 490,000
women, and cause 270,000 deaths annually.


91
0:8:42,61 --> 0:8:48,31
Circumcised men are both less likely to be
infected, and also less likely to transmit


92
0:8:48,31 --> 0:8:55,7
the infection. This may help to save the lives
of women. Vaccines against HPV may change


93
0:8:55,7 --> 0:8:59,88
the cost to benefit equation, but for the
moment, I think this is a point in favor of


94
0:8:59,88 --> 0:9:3,57
circumcision.


95
0:9:3,57 --> 0:9:8,6
Circumcision also reduces the risk of penile
cancer, although the prevalence of this condition


96
0:9:8,6 --> 0:9:13,22
is so rare that it's hard to put much emphasis
on this benefit.


97
0:9:13,22 --> 0:9:18,7
Circumcision reduces the likelihood of a urinary
tract infection by eliminating an area where


98
0:9:18,7 --> 0:9:24,49
infections can form and remain hidden. Since
newborns have a non-retractable foreskin,


99
0:9:24,49 --> 0:9:30,17
it provides a little pocket where bacteria
can lodge and grow. As a result, keeping a


100
0:9:30,17 --> 0:9:36,48
circumcised penis clean and dry appears to
be easier, but this could probably be overcome


101
0:9:36,48 --> 0:9:41,38
by a little extra effort on the part of the
parents.


102
0:9:41,38 --> 0:9:47,79
What kind of magnitude of benefit is seen
in circumcised infant boys? 1% of newborn


103
0:9:47,79 --> 0:9:55,959
boys develop a UTI, and the risk reduction
is about 10 fold. That sounds pretty impressive,


104
0:9:55,959 --> 0:10:2,32
but it means that we have to circumcise about
110 boys to prevent one UTI from occurring,


105
0:10:2,32 --> 0:10:8,14
which probably doesn't quite overcome the
risk of complications from the procedure.


106
0:10:8,14 --> 0:10:13,57
On the other hand, some little boys have a
high risk of UTI due to medical conditions


107
0:10:13,57 --> 0:10:19,23
where urine flows back into the ureter and
kidney, and circumcision lowers their risk


108
0:10:19,23 --> 0:10:25,75
enormously. In these cases, benefits clearly
outweigh risks, and only four circumcisions


109
0:10:25,75 --> 0:10:32,13
are needed to prevent one UTI. If you've ever
had a urinary tract infection, you know that


110
0:10:32,13 --> 0:10:36,579
they are not fun, and can potentially become
quite severe.


111
0:10:36,579 --> 0:10:41,97
Lastly, male infant circumcision can be protective
against certain rare conditions. Phimosis


112
0:10:41,97 --> 0:10:47,79
is a good example, where the foreskin doesn't
become retractible. This is a serious medical


113
0:10:47,79 --> 0:10:53,69
condition, and can require therapeutic circumcision,
or it can sometimes be treated with a simple


114
0:10:53,69 --> 0:10:56,649
steroid cream.


115
0:10:56,649 --> 0:11:0,45
There are other such conditions of the foreskin
that can be prevented by its removal at a


116
0:11:0,45 --> 0:11:6,87
very young age, although the cost to benefit
ratio for these may be questionable.


117
0:11:6,87 --> 0:11:11,47
3. Routine circumcisions are not recommended
by most medical authorities


118
0:11:11,47 --> 0:11:17,779
I'm just going to read the position statement
of the American Academy of Pediatrics. It


119
0:11:17,779 --> 0:11:23,99
typifies the fairly generic statements that
neither condone nor condemn the cultural practice


120
0:11:23,99 --> 0:11:31,17
of circumcision, but don't endorse a purely
medical indication for infant circumcision.


121
0:11:31,17 --> 0:11:35,99
"The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
believes that circumcision has potential medical


122
0:11:35,99 --> 0:11:41,64
benefits and advantages, as well as risks.
The existing scientific evidence is not sufficient


123
0:11:41,64 --> 0:11:47,66
to recommend routine circumcision. Therefore,
because the procedure is not essential to


124
0:11:47,66 --> 0:11:53,24
a child’s current well-being, we recommend
that the decision to circumcise is one best


125
0:11:53,24 --> 0:11:58,36
made by parents in consultation with their
pediatrician, taking into account what is


126
0:11:58,36 --> 0:12:3,949
in the best interests of the child, including
medical, religious, cultural, and ethnic traditions.


127
0:12:3,949 --> 0:12:5,42
"


128
0:12:5,42 --> 0:12:10,779
This is the current position statement, and
it reflects the modern consensus. In the past,


129
0:12:10,779 --> 0:12:16,47
the AAP has taken stronger stands against
or in favor of circumcision, depending on


130
0:12:16,47 --> 0:12:21,459
current evidence and the political environment.
Circumcision has seen a decline in recent


131
0:12:21,459 --> 0:12:26,899
years in the US, and I think the medical community
themselves are responsible for the change,


132
0:12:26,899 --> 0:12:32,66
advising parents about both medical and ethical
concerns of circumcision.


133
0:12:32,66 --> 0:12:41,7
4. The evidence about the negative health
consequences of circumcision is a mixed bag.


134
0:12:41,7 --> 0:12:46,11
One odd thing about being a biologist is that
so much is known about the human body that


135
0:12:46,11 --> 0:12:51,899
we have to specialize in one particular topic.
In this case, as I read through the list of


136
0:12:51,899 --> 0:12:58,42
adverse events associated with male circumcision,
I was painfully reminded of how little I know


137
0:12:58,42 --> 0:13:6,209
about that area of the body, despite EXTENSIVE
personal study and examination in my youth.


138
0:13:6,209 --> 0:13:12,72
Male infant circumcision may have some serious
associated risks, but it has to be remembered


139
0:13:12,72 --> 0:13:17,91
that 1 in 3 men are circumcised and that the
practice goes back into the misty recesses


140
0:13:17,91 --> 0:13:24,839
of pre-history, so the effects must be fairly
rare or non-critical. However, the kinds of


141
0:13:24,839 --> 0:13:30,649
complications listed in the literature required
that I go back to a medical dictionary. Here


142
0:13:30,649 --> 0:13:37,839
are some of the terms I encountered: lymphedema,
urinary fistula, hypospadias, epispadias,


143
0:13:37,839 --> 0:13:44,529
meatus ulceration and glans skin bridges.
Catastrophic events like partial or total


144
0:13:44,529 --> 0:13:51,17
loss of the function of the penis occur once
in every million or so circumcisions done


145
0:13:51,17 --> 0:13:52,88
under modern surgical conditions.


146
0:13:52,88 --> 0:14:0,269
One primary concern is a loss of sexual pleasure.
The tip of the penis is exposed, and over


147
0:14:0,269 --> 0:14:6,449
time the skin might be more likely to become
keratinized, or tougher and thicker, and therefore


148
0:14:6,449 --> 0:14:12,829
a little less sensitive, although most studies
didn't find this to be the case. There is


149
0:14:12,829 --> 0:14:18,19
also some concern about mutual enjoyment of
intercourse, although I didn't find much evidence


150
0:14:18,19 --> 0:14:23,87
for this in the literature, either. In fact,
in some studies the opposite is true, with


151
0:14:23,87 --> 0:14:29,1
surveys of female partners in Africa stating
that they preferred sex with their partner


152
0:14:29,1 --> 0:14:32,1
after he was circumcised.


153
0:14:32,1 --> 0:14:36,589
There are also some who speculate that the
pain and suffering of the procedure, together


154
0:14:36,589 --> 0:14:42,7
with inadequate anaesthesia, has an effect
on the child that translates into psychological


155
0:14:42,7 --> 0:14:48,69
damage. There is a definite effect on older
children between 2 and 6 who are old enough


156
0:14:48,69 --> 0:14:55,7
to be aware, but too young to understand,
called castration anxiety.


157
0:14:55,7 --> 0:15:1,99
All of this represents the purely scientific,
purely medical, pros and cons. This ignores


158
0:15:1,99 --> 0:15:8,93
the most deeply controversial topic, the ethics
and morality of surgical removal of a natural


159
0:15:8,93 --> 0:15:16,459
part of the human body. Here, science is silent.
Is it right for a parent to make such a decision


160
0:15:16,459 --> 0:15:23,269
for a child, one that is permanent and profound,
painful and risky? Does the physician honor


161
0:15:23,269 --> 0:15:28,48
their oath to do no harm, if they perform
this procedure without a medical indication?


162
0:15:28,48 --> 0:15:34,37
I've thought a very long time on this topic,
and I think that my own decision for my son


163
0:15:34,37 --> 0:15:41,19
might not have been justified. I deeply regret
that all this consideration comes now, when


164
0:15:41,19 --> 0:15:46,72
the decision is long past. I don't think he
was permanently harmed, and I don't think


165
0:15:46,72 --> 0:15:51,11
he'll have any problems in the future, but
I wish I had given the topic more thought


166
0:15:51,11 --> 0:15:53,31
at the time.


167
0:15:53,31 --> 0:15:57,519
I am most swayed by the argument about the
rights of the infant to make choices about


168
0:15:57,519 --> 0:16:3,66
their own body. I would prefer if the child
could make this decision. Unfortunately, the


169
0:16:3,66 --> 0:16:10,48
risk of complications of adult circumcision
make it much higher risk compared to infant


170
0:16:10,48 --> 0:16:14,199
circumcision. If the child can't make the
decision at the point where the procedure


171
0:16:14,199 --> 0:16:19,259
is safest, I think the parent usually has
the best interests of the child at heart,


172
0:16:19,259 --> 0:16:26,32
and any decision they make is part of their
legal guardianship. It's not an optimal solution,


173
0:16:26,32 --> 0:16:31,41
but it's one we've practiced in other cases
where important medical or legal decisions


174
0:16:31,41 --> 0:16:34,279
need to be made.


175
0:16:34,279 --> 0:16:39,16
I strongly support the use of anaesthetic
during the procedure, something that is not


176
0:16:39,16 --> 0:16:45,759
routinely done in the US. Some figures suggest
only about 25% of circumcisions are done under


177
0:16:45,759 --> 0:16:50,889
anaesthesia. Maybe I don't understand the
case against, but it seems like preventing


178
0:16:50,889 --> 0:16:56,42
pain and suffering is the least we can do
for the baby boy.


179
0:16:56,42 --> 0:17:1,639
Lastly, I know the topic of female genital
cutting is bound to come up in discussion.


180
0:17:1,639 --> 0:17:6,91
I don't consider the two procedures to be
equal. The closest analog in women to the


181
0:17:6,91 --> 0:17:12,63
male foreskin is the clitoral hood. This is
rarely the only tissue removed, usually the


182
0:17:12,63 --> 0:17:19,689
clitoris is either partially or entirely removed.
This is the equivalent of castration in males,


183
0:17:19,689 --> 0:17:25,839
something not practiced in modern cultures.
I'd like to keep the two issues separated,


184
0:17:25,839 --> 0:17:32,0
but I think it's only fair to allow for comparisons
so long as a proper equivalence is made. I


185
0:17:32,0 --> 0:17:37,39
am strongly opposed to female genital cutting.


186
0:17:37,39 --> 0:17:42,58
I'd like to summarize my own impressions from
research on this topic. I think the medical


187
0:17:42,58 --> 0:17:49,46
evidence is slightly in favor of routine circumcision.
There are no benefits that cannot be obtained


188
0:17:49,46 --> 0:17:56,309
in other ways. The most effective way to prevent
HIV and other STD transmission is still condom


189
0:17:56,309 --> 0:18:3,52
use or abstinence. Condom use is the best
solution. Proper foreskin hygeine, likewise,


190
0:18:3,52 --> 0:18:9,76
can greatly reduce UTI rates in young boys
without the need for surgical prevention.


191
0:18:9,76 --> 0:18:16,799
In the very real world, circumcision is an
imperfect solution, but one that seems to


192
0:18:16,799 --> 0:18:23,96
work. It could potentially save millions of
lives in high risk areas. The medical benefits


193
0:18:23,96 --> 0:18:31,32
are offset by medical risks and possible psychological
or sexual effects later in life, but I still


194
0:18:31,32 --> 0:18:34,9
think the evidence is slightly in favor.


195
0:18:34,9 --> 0:18:42,52
On the other hand, the ethical issues around
circumcision are, on the balance, anti-circumcision.


196
0:18:42,52 --> 0:18:47,66
It seems a violation of the rights of the
child to an intact body, and it seems to violate


197
0:18:47,66 --> 0:18:51,23
core medical ethics to do no harm.


198
0:18:51,23 --> 0:18:56,53
There is also the religious, cultural, or
family tradition to consider. Parents could


199
0:18:56,53 --> 0:19:1,26
be argued to have certain rights to decide
what traditions their children follow until


200
0:19:1,26 --> 0:19:6,32
their age of maturity. This is not an argument
that I find very compelling, so I won't go


201
0:19:6,32 --> 0:19:8,82
any deeper into it.


202
0:19:8,82 --> 0:19:13,88
I look forward to a "robust" discussion on
this topic. Before you start writing your


203
0:19:13,88 --> 0:19:21,289
500 character argument, though, I would make
three requests. One, try to avoid overly emotional


204
0:19:21,289 --> 0:19:28,47
wording and tactics. Two, if you make an assertion
of fact, a proper citation to a source is


205
0:19:28,47 --> 0:19:33,62
much appreciated. Note that links are not
only not allowed in YouTube comments, but


206
0:19:33,62 --> 0:19:39,36
they aren't even proper citations. Three,
and this is the challenge: I would ask that


207
0:19:39,36 --> 0:19:44,25
you avoid using any terms that you'd be uncomfortable
reading aloud to a nice old lady you met on


208
0:19:44,25 --> 0:19:50,72
the bus. Good luck, and be creative. Extravagantly
fictional prizes will be awarded to the best


209
0:19:50,72 --> 0:19:53,28
use of creatively non-offensive language.


210
0:19:53,28 --> 0:19:58,45
I have so many papers to cite that I've had
trouble posting them below. Instead, I've


211
0:19:58,45 --> 0:20:1,83
posted a link to the citations in the under-bar.


212
0:20:1,83 --> 0:22:1,83
As always, thanks for watching.
