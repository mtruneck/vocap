MATT CUTTS: Today's question
comes from Tokyo, Japan.


3
0:0:3,51 --> 0:0:6,59
The question is, you've been
sending various kinds of


4
0:0:6,59 --> 0:0:10,35
messages via Webmaster Tools
to improve transparency.


5
0:0:10,35 --> 0:0:11,59
It's a good move.


6
0:0:11,59 --> 0:0:14,65
How many types of messages do
you send, and how do you


7
0:0:14,65 --> 0:0:16,7
decide what message you send?


8
0:0:16,7 --> 0:0:17,46
Great question.


9
0:0:17,46 --> 0:0:20,5
So I can share a little
bit of stats.


10
0:0:20,5 --> 0:0:23,17
At this point, we do send
hundreds of thousands of


11
0:0:23,17 --> 0:0:24,97
messages each month.


12
0:0:24,97 --> 0:0:27,98
That might sound like a lot,
but for example, one search


13
0:0:27,98 --> 0:0:31,72
engine named Blekko estimated
that a million spam pages are


14
0:0:31,72 --> 0:0:33,39
created every hour.


15
0:0:33,39 --> 0:0:36,72
So the web is very large, so
it shouldn't be a surprise


16
0:0:36,72 --> 0:0:38,57
that some percentage
of it is spam.


17
0:0:38,57 --> 0:0:42,61
And as a result, we do spend a
lot of time finding that spam.


18
0:0:42,61 --> 0:0:45,66
And since we automatically
send messages and


19
0:0:45,66 --> 0:0:49,2
notifications when we find it,
there are a lot, hundreds of


20
0:0:49,2 --> 0:0:52,13
thousands of notifications that
we send out each month.


21
0:0:52,13 --> 0:0:54,4
There's a lot of different
categories of spam.


22
0:0:54,4 --> 0:0:55,7
They're covered in our
Webmaster Guidelines,


23
0:0:55,7 --> 0:0:59,64
everything from cloaking to
scraping to sneaky JavaScript


24
0:0:59,64 --> 0:1:2,57
redirects, paid links,
all sorts of stuff.


25
0:1:2,57 --> 0:1:6,43
But all of those boil down to
roughly about 10 different


26
0:1:6,43 --> 0:1:8,1
messages that we send.


27
0:1:8,1 --> 0:1:11,35
So hidden text, keyword
stuffing, gibberish, all that


28
0:1:11,35 --> 0:1:13,69
would go into one message
that we send out.


29
0:1:13,69 --> 0:1:16,45
I can share some stats from
earlier this year, from


30
0:1:16,45 --> 0:1:18,9
January and February.


31
0:1:18,9 --> 0:1:20,33
Out of the hundreds of thousands
of messages that we


32
0:1:20,33 --> 0:1:24,54
sent over that time period,
roughly 90% of those were for


33
0:1:24,54 --> 0:1:25,62
what we call Black Hat.


34
0:1:25,62 --> 0:1:29,1
That's pure, egregious spam,
clear cut, anybody


35
0:1:29,1 --> 0:1:31,74
sufficiently tech savvy would
probably be able to recognize


36
0:1:31,74 --> 0:1:32,56
that it's spam.


37
0:1:32,56 --> 0:1:35,57
It's the stuff that you think
of as traditional junk that


38
0:1:35,57 --> 0:1:38,46
you just don't want to show up
in your results because it is


39
0:1:38,46 --> 0:1:41,26
very clearly spam.


40
0:1:41,26 --> 0:1:45,89
About 4% of the messages were
because the content had little


41
0:1:45,89 --> 0:1:48,89
or no added value, and so it's
not ranking as highly in our


42
0:1:48,89 --> 0:1:50,21
search results.


43
0:1:50,21 --> 0:1:52,65
About 3% of the messages
that we sent


44
0:1:52,65 --> 0:1:53,97
were related to hacking.


45
0:1:53,97 --> 0:1:57,34
So hacking is a big attack
as far as Black Hats.


46
0:1:57,34 --> 0:1:59,65
And even though it's illegal,
there's a lot of people that


47
0:1:59,65 --> 0:2:2,78
do that-- trying to promote
their pharmacy pills or


48
0:2:2,78 --> 0:2:4,16
whatever, that sort of thing.


49
0:2:4,16 --> 0:2:7,54
So about 3% of those messages
were related to hacking.


50
0:2:7,54 --> 0:2:10,12
Something like 2% of the
messages that we sent out were


51
0:2:10,12 --> 0:2:12,38
related to link buying,
and about 1% were


52
0:2:12,38 --> 0:2:13,83
related to link selling.


53
0:2:13,83 --> 0:2:18,26
So overall between 2% and 3%
related to links and link spam


54
0:2:18,26 --> 0:2:20,47
overall about buying
and selling links.


55
0:2:20,47 --> 0:2:23,87
So that gives you a broad idea
of the sorts of categories


56
0:2:23,87 --> 0:2:27,2
that we send things out for
and the rough number of


57
0:2:27,2 --> 0:2:28,64
messages that we send
out each month.


58
0:2:28,64 --> 0:4:28,64
