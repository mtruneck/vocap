1
0:0:14,695 --> 0:0:19,966
One cannot deny, I suppose,
that murder has its uses in society.


2
0:0:19,966 --> 0:0:21,935
But I must say that in the past,


3
0:0:21,935 --> 0:0:28,608
it has been pursued with more
enthusiasm than accuracy.


4
0:0:28,608 --> 0:0:35,549
Explosive devices certainly went off,
but usually in the wrong place...


5
0:0:35,549 --> 0:0:38,218
...at the right time,


6
0:0:38,218 --> 0:0:45,258
or the right place at the wrong time.


7
0:0:45,258 --> 0:0:49,763
Quite suddenly, all this inefficiency
became a thing of the past.


8
0:0:49,763 --> 0:0:56,937
Murders began to be committed
with a sort of unholy precision.


9
0:0:56,937 --> 0:1:0,841
A comprehensive service
was now being offered by


10
0:1:0,841 --> 0:2:39,84
the Assassination Bureau... Limited.


11
0:2:39,84 --> 0:2:43,577
This is from your own paper,
two weeks ago.


12
0:2:43,577 --> 0:2:47,247
There is only one common factor in
these killings: Ruthless efficiency.


13
0:2:47,247 --> 0:2:52,85
No social or political bias,
just murder as a fine art.


14
0:2:52,85 --> 0:2:54,788
"Mesopotamia"?
What the devil does that mean?


15
0:2:54,788 --> 0:2:58,492
Personal Column of The Times, three
weeks before Alderman J.T. Langer


16
0:2:58,492 --> 0:3:2,329
was blown up by
an exploding casket.


17
0:3:2,329 --> 0:3:5,432
Berliner Morgenpost,
two weeks before Count von Kissen


18
0:3:5,432 --> 0:3:9,736
fell down the lift shaft
at the Adlon Hotel.


19
0:3:9,736 --> 0:3:11,538
- Our own paper.
- Good heavens.


20
0:3:11,538 --> 0:3:14,307
One week before the affair
of the exploding Bible.


21
0:3:14,307 --> 0:3:18,44
I believe this is how prospective
clients contact this organization.


22
0:3:18,44 --> 0:3:21,248
Employ me, and you
can have my story.


23
0:3:21,248 --> 0:3:23,45
But that's our paper again.


24
0:3:23,45 --> 0:3:25,785
Find out who placed it.
Get to Small Ads!


25
0:3:25,785 --> 0:3:27,988
Pray, don't bother.
I know who placed it.


26
0:3:27,988 --> 0:3:30,9
- Who?
- I did.


27
0:3:30,9 --> 0:3:33,26
The ad has been answered,
my name and address supplied.


28
0:3:33,26 --> 0:3:35,795
I expect them to get in touch
with me at any moment.


29
0:3:35,795 --> 0:3:38,64
- Splendid. Splendid!
- My lord.


30
0:3:38,64 --> 0:3:41,167
You certainly are the New Woman
incarnate, Miss Winter.


31
0:3:41,167 --> 0:3:44,204
I slipped in unobserved so
Miss Winter would talk freely.


32
0:3:44,204 --> 0:3:46,206
I always talk freely. Who are you?


33
0:3:46,206 --> 0:3:49,242
This is Lord Bostwick,
the owner of our newspaper.


34
0:3:49,242 --> 0:3:51,177
How do you do?


35
0:3:51,177 --> 0:3:53,68
The newspaper business
is a male preserve.


36
0:3:53,68 --> 0:4:1,421
If you are plotting to breach the citadel,
it should be done in privacy. Come.


37
0:4:1,421 --> 0:4:4,691
Sit down. Sit down.


38
0:4:4,691 --> 0:4:7,761
Put you to work in this office,
and they'd all walk out.


39
0:4:7,761 --> 0:4:10,3
But they'd leap
to take you out to dinner.


40
0:4:10,3 --> 0:4:12,98
Why should they ask
me out to dinner?


41
0:4:12,98 --> 0:4:14,601
Because you are a very
attractive young woman.


42
0:4:14,601 --> 0:4:18,405
There can be no sexual equality whilst
women exploit their appearance.


43
0:4:18,405 --> 0:4:19,906
I rigidly avoid it.


44
0:4:19,906 --> 0:4:25,245
Yes, well, this lift will take us
to my office.


45
0:4:25,245 --> 0:4:30,5
- Allow me to offer you a little reviver.
- I touch no spirituous liquor.


46
0:4:30,5 --> 0:4:33,153
I should hope not.
This is a fine Madeira.


47
0:4:33,153 --> 0:4:36,623
I have a partiality for it, just as I have
for adventurous women.


48
0:4:36,623 --> 0:4:39,59
What, then, is your reaction
to my proposal?


49
0:4:39,59 --> 0:4:43,797
That this newspaper should support
you to the full extent of its resources.


50
0:4:43,797 --> 0:4:46,132
It is truly wonderful
to find someone as


51
0:4:46,132 --> 0:4:49,336
liberal as yourself in a position
of power and authority.


52
0:4:49,336 --> 0:4:52,872
Yes, indeed. It's not at all common.


53
0:4:52,872 --> 0:4:55,442
My newspapers are only
a means to an end.


54
0:4:55,442 --> 0:4:59,279
I have a genuine concern
for the political welfare of the world.


55
0:4:59,279 --> 0:5:3,75
You'd be astonished if I told you of the
courts in Europe where I wield power.


56
0:5:3,75 --> 0:5:6,419
Behind the thrones, of course.
I am a retiring man.


57
0:5:6,419 --> 0:5:8,588
It will be an honor to work for you.


58
0:5:8,588 --> 0:5:10,857
I'd like to keep it
a secret between us.


59
0:5:10,857 --> 0:5:12,759
- Why?
- Because, Miss Winter,


60
0:5:12,759 --> 0:5:16,63
if there's truth to what you say, I'd be
a marked man for supporting you.


61
0:5:16,63 --> 0:5:19,32
- I see.
- You'll have to be satisfied,


62
0:5:19,32 --> 0:5:21,768
- with the thin end of the wedge.
- Very well.


63
0:5:21,768 --> 0:5:24,871
I want your employment,
and need your resources behind me.


64
0:5:24,871 --> 0:5:28,274
In that case, sit down and tell me
a little bit about your plan.


65
0:5:28,274 --> 0:5:30,977
I must admit that one
thing intrigues me.


66
0:5:30,977 --> 0:5:33,446
- And what is that?
- Apart from your desire


67
0:5:33,446 --> 0:5:37,45
to prove women's equality with men,
what is your object in contacting


68
0:5:37,45 --> 0:5:41,187
- these organized assassins?
- Surely that's obvious.


69
0:5:41,187 --> 0:5:56,603
I want someone assassinated.


70
0:5:56,603 --> 0:6:1,7
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's all right, lady. I'm used to it.


71
0:6:1,7 --> 0:6:3,9
- Your matches.
- It doesn't matter.


72
0:6:3,9 --> 0:6:7,8
I've lost me eyes, lady,
but I've still got my pride.


73
0:6:7,8 --> 0:6:19,259
Yes, of course.


74
0:6:19,259 --> 0:6:44,384
"Mr. Pemberty's bowler."


75
0:6:44,384 --> 0:6:47,454
Pardon me, madam.
Are you being attended to?


76
0:6:47,454 --> 0:6:51,691
No. I've come to collect
Mr. Pemberty's bowler.


77
0:6:51,691 --> 0:6:54,294
- Mr. Pemberty's?
- Yes.


78
0:6:54,294 --> 0:6:58,665
Very hard-wearing felt, madam,
from Mesopotamia.


79
0:6:58,665 --> 0:7:1,301
I am sure Mr. Pemberty
will be pleased with it.


80
0:7:1,301 --> 0:7:3,136
Oh, I'm sure he will.


81
0:7:3,136 --> 0:7:9,409
If you would care to take it,
we will deliver it for you.


82
0:7:9,409 --> 0:7:40,774
This way, madam.


83
0:7:40,774 --> 0:7:45,879
Just through here, madam.


84
0:7:45,879 --> 0:7:48,181
I must apologize for the lack
of amenities,


85
0:7:48,181 --> 0:7:50,65
but we don't usually cater
for lady customers.


86
0:7:50,65 --> 0:8:26,286
However, the journey
will not take long.


87
0:8:26,286 --> 0:8:28,421
Whoa.


88
0:8:28,421 --> 0:8:32,225
Back. Back.


89
0:8:32,225 --> 0:8:43,837
Whoa.


90
0:8:43,837 --> 0:8:45,772
This way, madam.


91
0:8:45,772 --> 0:8:49,175
These cloak-and-dagger precautions
are an unfortunate necessity.


92
0:8:49,175 --> 0:9:28,915
We try and keep them
to a minimum.


93
0:9:28,915 --> 0:9:34,2
Forgive me. A test for our customers.
We're not used to dealing with ladies.


94
0:9:34,2 --> 0:9:36,789
- Evidently.
- An interesting reaction.


95
0:9:36,789 --> 0:9:39,659
Men come on gruesome business,
yet without exception


96
0:9:39,659 --> 0:9:43,96
they are frightened out of their wits
by a whiff of gunpowder.


97
0:9:43,96 --> 0:9:50,57
You seem to be made of sterner stuff.
Will you please be seated?


98
0:9:50,57 --> 0:9:52,538
Miss Winter, you are not married.


99
0:9:52,538 --> 0:9:56,643
You have, as far as we can ascertain,
no romantic associations.


100
0:9:56,643 --> 0:10:0,647
Whom, other than a husband or lover,
could a young lady wish to kill?


101
0:10:0,647 --> 0:10:3,917
- You know a lot about me.
- Naturally, or you'd not be here.


102
0:10:3,917 --> 0:10:6,386
At least may I know
whom I am addressing?


103
0:10:6,386 --> 0:10:11,291
Certainly. I am lvan Dragomiloff.
Oh, don't be put off by the name.


104
0:10:11,291 --> 0:10:14,46
My father's Russian sentimentality
has been counteracted by


105
0:10:14,46 --> 0:10:18,364
- an English public school education.
- Are you head of this organization?


106
0:10:18,364 --> 0:10:21,0
- Certainly.
- You look extremely young.


107
0:10:21,0 --> 0:10:24,37
Oh, don't let that worry you.
I was born and bred for the job.


108
0:10:24,37 --> 0:10:26,539
- That's terrible.
- It's not terrible.


109
0:10:26,539 --> 0:10:29,242
My father brought me up
to continue his life work.


110
0:10:29,242 --> 0:10:32,245
It's natural for a son to inherit
the family business.


111
0:10:32,245 --> 0:10:34,147
Business? You're murderers.


112
0:10:34,147 --> 0:10:38,318
Our proper title is
the Assassination Bureau, Limited.


113
0:10:38,318 --> 0:10:42,655
- Our dividends are quite substantial.
- You admit you take life for money.


114
0:10:42,655 --> 0:10:46,292
Money is life, don't you agree?
The lack of it has killed more people


115
0:10:46,292 --> 0:10:49,128
one way or another than
100 Assassination Bureaus.


116
0:10:49,128 --> 0:10:53,533
Human life is possibly the most
expendable commodity we possess.


117
0:10:53,533 --> 0:11:2,141
It's so easily replaced,
and so pleasurably.


118
0:11:2,141 --> 0:11:4,978
This is fantastic.
You're a monster.


119
0:11:4,978 --> 0:11:9,849
No. My father only saw to it that I was
educated in the logic of my profession.


120
0:11:9,849 --> 0:11:13,252
- He was somewhat of a philosopher.
- I'm not interested in him.


121
0:11:13,252 --> 0:11:16,556
- May we get down to business?
- Certainly. Please be seated.


122
0:11:16,556 --> 0:11:19,459
Very well, then.
What about your fees?


123
0:11:19,459 --> 0:11:23,229
Oh, we have a sliding scale, according
to the importance of the victim.


124
0:11:23,229 --> 0:11:26,733
Quality is always worth paying for.
We have very high overheads.


125
0:11:26,733 --> 0:11:30,336
Since taking over, I have tried
to completely modernize our methods.


126
0:11:30,336 --> 0:11:33,506
This, after all, is the age of science.


127
0:11:33,506 --> 0:11:35,842
Take, for instance, this little bomb.


128
0:11:35,842 --> 0:11:38,11
We've just issued it
to all our branches.


129
0:11:38,11 --> 0:11:44,25
It can be timed to go off
at any hour one chooses.


130
0:11:44,25 --> 0:11:47,72
And its tick is no louder
than a normal clock.


131
0:11:47,72 --> 0:11:51,758
Switched off, it's as harmless
as your pocket watch...


132
0:11:51,758 --> 0:11:55,528
...unless you drop it, of course.
Miss Winter, please don't be shy.


133
0:11:55,528 --> 0:11:59,966
Confide in me as you would
in a doctor or a priest.


134
0:11:59,966 --> 0:12:1,901
Whom do you wish to kill?


135
0:12:1,901 --> 0:12:4,737
You will undertake this assignment,
Mr. Dragomiloff?


136
0:12:4,737 --> 0:12:8,908
I shall want justification.
Of what sins is he guilty?


137
0:12:8,908 --> 0:12:12,11
Pride.


138
0:12:12,11 --> 0:12:15,48
- Avarice.
- Oh, dear, dear.


139
0:12:15,48 --> 0:12:18,951
And murder.


140
0:12:18,951 --> 0:12:21,22
He seems a suitable candidate.


141
0:12:21,22 --> 0:12:23,589
You guarantee that he will be killed?


142
0:12:23,589 --> 0:12:26,25
You have my word.


143
0:12:26,25 --> 0:12:28,561
The name, please.


144
0:12:28,561 --> 0:12:34,467
Very well, then. His name is...


145
0:12:34,467 --> 0:12:40,506
...lvan Dragomiloff.


146
0:12:40,506 --> 0:12:44,577
I shall need further identification.


147
0:12:44,577 --> 0:12:49,82
He is of Russian extraction,
though educated in England.


148
0:12:49,82 --> 0:12:51,951
Physical characteristics?


149
0:12:51,951 --> 0:12:54,787
Approximately your size,
weight and age.


150
0:12:54,787 --> 0:13:0,59
I was born in the province of Valenko.
Where was your man born?


151
0:13:0,59 --> 0:13:10,937
In the province of Valenko.


152
0:13:10,937 --> 0:13:16,42
I am compelled to believe
that you mean me.


153
0:13:16,42 --> 0:13:17,51
I do.


154
0:13:17,51 --> 0:13:19,612
You puzzle me, Miss Winter.


155
0:13:19,612 --> 0:13:23,449
We've never met, yet you want my life.
Why? Why?


156
0:13:23,449 --> 0:13:25,17
Because of my organization?


157
0:13:25,17 --> 0:13:34,193
Because you believe "kill me,
kill my bureau." Is that it? Is that it?!


158
0:13:34,193 --> 0:13:38,598
What an absolutely marvelous idea.


159
0:13:38,598 --> 0:13:41,334
It was not intended to amuse you.


160
0:13:41,334 --> 0:13:44,7
But it does. It intrigues me too.


161
0:13:44,7 --> 0:13:49,175
It will let me put my aging colleagues
on their mettle. Wonderful.


162
0:13:49,175 --> 0:13:53,412
Since you'll enjoy it, perhaps you'd
give me a bargain price?


163
0:13:53,412 --> 0:13:57,15
There's one matter upon which my
board never compromise, on finance.


164
0:13:57,15 --> 0:14:0,119
Without self-flattery,
you'll never afford me.


165
0:14:0,119 --> 0:14:2,321
Name your price.


166
0:14:2,321 --> 0:14:4,29
Well, I'm not my father, of course,


167
0:14:4,29 --> 0:14:8,161
but in all due honesty I couldn't put
myself in at a penny less than...


168
0:14:8,161 --> 0:14:10,263
...20,000 pounds.


169
0:14:10,263 --> 0:14:14,66
- What a pity.
- I accept.


170
0:14:14,66 --> 0:14:17,77
- You do?
- You will no doubt wish to count it.


171
0:14:17,77 --> 0:14:23,409
But you will find each bundle
contains a thousand pounds.


172
0:14:23,409 --> 0:14:28,147
I trust your board
will be quite satisfied.


173
0:14:28,147 --> 0:14:30,249
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.


174
0:14:30,249 --> 0:14:32,785
- Popescu, good job in Zagreb.
- Thank you.


175
0:14:32,785 --> 0:14:34,287
Gentlemen.


176
0:14:34,287 --> 0:14:38,24
General von Pinck. Military life
certainly keeps you fit, sir.


177
0:14:38,24 --> 0:14:42,562
Lucoville, welcome to London.
You too, my dear Weiss.


178
0:14:42,562 --> 0:14:45,131
Cesare, you're putting on weight.


179
0:14:45,131 --> 0:14:47,333
Food is the greatest
pleasure in my life.


180
0:14:47,333 --> 0:14:51,137
Greatest? They tell me your wife
is the most beautiful woman in Venice.


181
0:14:51,137 --> 0:14:53,706
She is also the best cook.


182
0:14:53,706 --> 0:15:22,301
And now, gentlemen,
to business, please.


183
0:15:22,301 --> 0:15:25,871
It is fortunate that you're all
in London for this meeting.


184
0:15:25,871 --> 0:15:29,909
Something has come up
which has... How shall I put it?


185
0:15:29,909 --> 0:15:32,878
Crystallized thoughts I've had
for some time past.


186
0:15:32,878 --> 0:15:35,915
Look at the great deeds recorded
on these walls, gentlemen,


187
0:15:35,915 --> 0:15:39,85
each one performed in the course
of bettering the world,


188
0:15:39,85 --> 0:15:42,622
purging it of evil,
striking down tyranny.


189
0:15:42,622 --> 0:15:46,325
In those days, you were all ruled by
my father's principle that our bureau


190
0:15:46,325 --> 0:15:50,196
would never kill anyone without
a sound moral reason for doing so.


191
0:15:50,196 --> 0:15:54,2
He was a saintly man.


192
0:15:54,2 --> 0:15:57,57
Do you still adhere to his principles?


193
0:15:57,57 --> 0:16:0,706
Consider a moment. Be honest.
Haven't we, in the pursuit of profit,


194
0:16:0,706 --> 0:16:4,377
fallen short of the high morals
upon which our bureau was founded?


195
0:16:4,377 --> 0:16:7,98
It's always possible to find a good
moral reason for killing anybody.


196
0:16:7,98 --> 0:16:11,25
Everybody, from some point
of view, deserves death.


197
0:16:11,25 --> 0:16:12,885
Man is born to die.


198
0:16:12,885 --> 0:16:16,188
No operation that
consistently shows a profit


199
0:16:16,188 --> 0:16:20,826
can do so without answering
a legitimate demand.


200
0:16:20,826 --> 0:16:23,396
You say that we are justified
by the prosperity


201
0:16:23,396 --> 0:16:25,364
our operations have brought us all.


202
0:16:25,364 --> 0:16:27,767
You, Lucoville,
with your string of hotels.


203
0:16:27,767 --> 0:16:30,436
You, general, with your
estates and castles.


204
0:16:30,436 --> 0:16:33,172
You, Weiss, with your
Swiss banking syndicates,


205
0:16:33,172 --> 0:16:40,179
and you Spado, with your
fake antiques. And you...


206
0:16:40,179 --> 0:16:43,983
Oh, dear, we seem to have started our
meeting without our vice chairman.


207
0:16:43,983 --> 0:16:50,189
Does anybody know?


208
0:16:50,189 --> 0:16:52,958
Lord Bostwick, my apologies.
We started without you.


209
0:16:52,958 --> 0:16:56,996
Forgive me. A fallen horse in Piccadilly
caused a terrible congestion.


210
0:16:56,996 --> 0:16:59,899
How the traffic will flow
when it is all motorized.


211
0:16:59,899 --> 0:17:2,1
Please, proceed, Mr. Chairman.


212
0:17:2,1 --> 0:17:5,271
Thank you, my lord. I wish to put
a commission before you.


213
0:17:5,271 --> 0:17:8,674
It is an assignment I welcome
and have accepted on your behalf.


214
0:17:8,674 --> 0:17:11,711
To the commission of
Miss Sonya Winter for 20,000 pounds,


215
0:17:11,711 --> 0:17:24,56
the assassination of lvan Dragomiloff,
your chairman.


216
0:17:24,56 --> 0:17:27,693
Miss Winter has put into my hands
the very weapon I need.


217
0:17:27,693 --> 0:17:30,196
With all respect, I no longer
see in you the idealism


218
0:17:30,196 --> 0:17:32,431
without which we are no more
than murderers.


219
0:17:32,431 --> 0:17:35,668
Murderers! We are assassins!


220
0:17:35,668 --> 0:17:39,605
I aim to put you to the test.
I believe Miss Winter has shown us


221
0:17:39,605 --> 0:17:43,109
the way to rekindle the torch
we once held so high.


222
0:17:43,109 --> 0:17:48,781
We won't stand for it.


223
0:17:48,781 --> 0:17:50,383
It's really quite simple.


224
0:17:50,383 --> 0:17:52,585
Under our constitution
we have the right


225
0:17:52,585 --> 0:17:56,21
to accept commissions on behalf of all.
I have accepted this one.


226
0:17:56,21 --> 0:17:58,958
But what does it mean?


227
0:17:58,958 --> 0:18:3,329
It means, my friends,
that you must kill me,


228
0:18:3,329 --> 0:18:8,134
or I will kill you.


229
0:18:8,134 --> 0:18:15,341
Kill us?


230
0:18:15,341 --> 0:18:17,109
Yes, gentlemen, kill you.


231
0:18:17,109 --> 0:18:20,546
Not to put too fine a point on it,
I consider you all expendable.


232
0:18:20,546 --> 0:18:23,282
Taking the honorable course,
I challenge you to this duel.


233
0:18:23,282 --> 0:18:27,82
Yes, but supposing, my dear young
friend, that we succeed in killing you?


234
0:18:27,82 --> 0:18:30,756
Then you, Lord Bostwick,
whom I appoint as neutral referee


235
0:18:30,756 --> 0:18:34,16
in this game, will, as vice chairman,
take over my position,


236
0:18:34,16 --> 0:18:36,195
pending the election
of my successor.


237
0:18:36,195 --> 0:18:44,67
I repeat, gentlemen.
The commission has been accepted.


238
0:18:44,67 --> 0:18:47,807
We must now settle a moment
to begin this little adventure.


239
0:18:47,807 --> 0:18:49,608
We must give you time
to return home.


240
0:18:49,608 --> 0:18:51,911
Some of your journeys
will be longer than others.


241
0:18:51,911 --> 0:18:55,347
Let us say that 24 hours from now
we shall be considered at hazard.


242
0:18:55,347 --> 0:18:59,952
Lord Bostwick, we'd better
synchronize our watches.


243
0:18:59,952 --> 0:19:3,556
7:30.


244
0:19:3,556 --> 0:19:8,461
Gentlemen, 24 hours from the striking
of this gavel, we shall be at hazard.


245
0:19:8,461 --> 0:19:33,419
From tomorrow then,
at precisely 7:30 p.m.


246
0:19:33,419 --> 0:19:35,488
Hardly the act of a gentleman.


247
0:19:35,488 --> 0:19:43,62
But one should always
applaud initiative.


248
0:19:43,62 --> 0:19:48,3
Good night to you, gentlemen,
and good luck.


249
0:19:48,3 --> 0:19:52,71
We must go after him. This ridiculous
nonsense must be stopped.


250
0:19:52,71 --> 0:19:54,907
The motion has been accepted.
Discipline must be observed.


251
0:19:54,907 --> 0:19:58,944
Why should we accept it?
We've given our lives for the Bureau.


252
0:19:58,944 --> 0:20:1,247
- Not yet.
- Gentlemen,


253
0:20:1,247 --> 0:20:5,751
it's not a moneymaking proposition.


254
0:20:5,751 --> 0:20:8,254
As acting chairman,
I call you to order.


255
0:20:8,254 --> 0:20:12,525
Gentlemen, we have all been very loyal
to the memory of our dear founder,


256
0:20:12,525 --> 0:20:15,6
but let us be honest with ourselves.


257
0:20:15,6 --> 0:20:19,31
I think we have all felt that seniority
should have counted for something


258
0:20:19,31 --> 0:20:20,9
when the succession was decided.


259
0:20:20,9 --> 0:20:23,369
He should not have
come in at the top.


260
0:20:23,369 --> 0:20:26,372
- His father trained the boy well.
- Of course.


261
0:20:26,372 --> 0:20:28,774
Please do not misunderstand me,
gentlemen.


262
0:20:28,774 --> 0:20:31,544
I'm merely suggesting that it is
in everybody's interest


263
0:20:31,544 --> 0:20:35,648
to go along with our young
chairman's sporting proposition.


264
0:20:35,648 --> 0:20:40,92
In fact, I feel it is my duty as referee
to stimulate your enthusiasm.


265
0:20:40,92 --> 0:20:44,99
In addition to Miss Winter's fee,
I offer a prize of 10,000 pounds


266
0:20:44,99 --> 0:20:47,693
to whichever member accomplishes
her commission.


267
0:20:47,693 --> 0:20:50,93
A very sporting gesture, my lord.


268
0:20:50,93 --> 0:20:53,265
No, no, no, no.


269
0:20:53,265 --> 0:20:56,135
Our young chairman deserves
all the credit.


270
0:20:56,135 --> 0:21:16,855
He conceived this great adventure.
He is certainly a sportsman.


271
0:21:16,855 --> 0:21:20,626
Isn't he handsome.


272
0:21:20,626 --> 0:21:24,663
Really.


273
0:21:24,663 --> 0:21:29,501
Good morning.


274
0:21:29,501 --> 0:21:36,976
Shall we take a little walk
in the park, Miss Winter?


275
0:21:36,976 --> 0:21:38,711
Mr. Dragomiloff.


276
0:21:38,711 --> 0:21:42,147
Oh, forgive the disguise.
Thanks to you, I'm a marked man.


277
0:21:42,147 --> 0:21:45,918
My bureau accepted
your commission.


278
0:21:45,918 --> 0:21:47,987
Well, really.


279
0:21:47,987 --> 0:21:50,222
The Albert Memorial?


280
0:21:50,222 --> 0:21:52,491
It was an agreed rendezvous.


281
0:21:52,491 --> 0:21:55,561
It was glorious in
the park this morning.


282
0:21:55,561 --> 0:21:58,731
- Well, when are you leaving?
- Leaving?


283
0:21:58,731 --> 0:22:3,2
Miss Winter, have you forgotten
so soon that you're a journalist?


284
0:22:3,2 --> 0:22:5,304
- What more can I do?
- Follow Dragomiloff.


285
0:22:5,304 --> 0:22:7,373
Report on his execution.


286
0:22:7,373 --> 0:22:11,243
It's the greatest story of the decade,
and covered by a woman.


287
0:22:11,243 --> 0:22:14,613
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- Of course.


288
0:22:14,613 --> 0:22:19,585
My secretary will take care
of everything. Money, tickets...


289
0:22:19,585 --> 0:22:21,954
But I suppose you don't
know where he'll go.


290
0:22:21,954 --> 0:22:24,623
Well, he did tell me quite
a lot about the Bureau,


291
0:22:24,623 --> 0:22:27,226
where it operates and everything.


292
0:22:27,226 --> 0:22:30,462
- We walked by the Serpentine.
- Miss Winter,


293
0:22:30,462 --> 0:22:32,531
you do want to go
on with the story?


294
0:22:32,531 --> 0:22:34,5
I've invested a lot of money in it.


295
0:22:34,5 --> 0:22:39,304
Oh, most certainly. I shall have the
greatest pleasure in reporting his...


296
0:22:39,304 --> 0:22:41,84
- Whatever happens to him.
- Splendid.


297
0:22:41,84 --> 0:22:46,612
Now, remember, you are to wire me
personally about all his movements.


298
0:22:46,612 --> 0:22:50,749
Now, to where shall
we buy you a ticket?


299
0:22:50,749 --> 0:22:57,156
To Paris.


300
0:22:57,156 --> 0:23:3,429
Shocking.


301
0:23:3,429 --> 0:23:8,534
Disgusting.


302
0:23:8,534 --> 0:23:12,37
It's disgraceful. It's a scandal.


303
0:23:12,37 --> 0:23:16,975
Oh! It's an outrage.
What has happened to my Paris?


304
0:23:16,975 --> 0:23:21,78
It has become a sink of iniquity.
A sewer. A den of vice.


305
0:23:21,78 --> 0:23:24,95
- The tourists expect it, my dear.
- Oh, nonsense!


306
0:23:24,95 --> 0:23:27,92
The whole civilized world
is shocked by it.


307
0:23:27,92 --> 0:23:31,59
Nobody knows that better than you,
Henri. Oh, yes, my dear.


308
0:23:31,59 --> 0:23:34,159
You are one of the few
senators of the republic


309
0:23:34,159 --> 0:23:37,296
who have dared to
stand out against evil.


310
0:23:37,296 --> 0:23:39,198
I suppose it was my duty.


311
0:23:39,198 --> 0:23:42,901
Oh, I respect you for it.
Though sometimes I must confess,


312
0:23:42,901 --> 0:23:45,471
- I fear for you.
- Fear for me?


313
0:23:45,471 --> 0:23:49,208
To oppose this underworld of vice
may endanger your very life.


314
0:23:49,208 --> 0:23:52,511
Well, it was your idea.


315
0:23:52,511 --> 0:23:55,47
Somebody had to speak out.
As I've always said,


316
0:23:55,47 --> 0:23:57,416
if you want something done,
do it yourself.


317
0:23:57,416 --> 0:24:0,419
Well, my dear, I must be
off to the senate.


318
0:24:0,419 --> 0:24:3,21
We've a sitting that may
go on most of the night.


319
0:24:3,21 --> 0:24:6,892
The women of France will never forget
what you're doing for them, Henri.


320
0:24:6,892 --> 0:24:21,173
I hope not. Good night.


321
0:24:21,173 --> 0:24:24,176
- Anything to report?
- There's not a sign of him.


322
0:24:24,176 --> 0:24:25,944
Everyone has been shown
his photo.


323
0:24:25,944 --> 0:24:50,135
Watch carefully. He's a devil.


324
0:24:50,135 --> 0:24:52,571
- Good evening, Monsieur Lucoville.
- Good evening.


325
0:24:52,571 --> 0:24:55,24
- How is business?
- Up a little on last week.


326
0:24:55,24 --> 0:24:57,709
And how is the new
cheap champagne going?


327
0:24:57,709 --> 0:25:1,46
We serve it after midnight, same price,
and nobody notices.


328
0:25:1,46 --> 0:25:5,317
Excellent. You have been warned
to look out for a certain man.


329
0:25:5,317 --> 0:25:7,186
I have his picture here.


330
0:25:7,186 --> 0:25:26,738
- He will not pass.
- Excellent.


331
0:25:26,738 --> 0:25:28,907
I am informed that one
may find here


332
0:25:28,907 --> 0:25:34,146
the most suitable
arrangements for the night.


333
0:25:34,146 --> 0:25:37,649
Monsieur le Comte de...
Certainly, Your Excellency.


334
0:25:37,649 --> 0:25:42,921
We shall arrange for you
something special.


335
0:25:42,921 --> 0:25:46,425
Good evening.


336
0:25:46,425 --> 0:25:59,4
Just one moment.


337
0:25:59,4 --> 0:26:1,773
My dear count, it's a pleasure
to welcome you to our house.


338
0:26:1,773 --> 0:26:4,776
- Well, madame, I am incognito.
- But of course.


339
0:26:4,776 --> 0:26:8,313
You will be one of our best-known
unknown visitors. This way.


340
0:26:8,313 --> 0:26:20,926
Phillippe, champagne
in the Swan Room at once.


341
0:26:20,926 --> 0:26:24,396
Absolutely hopeless.
This one has knock-knees


342
0:26:24,396 --> 0:26:28,433
and this one has the most frightful
hangdog look about her.


343
0:26:28,433 --> 0:26:30,302
And as for this one,


344
0:26:30,302 --> 0:26:35,173
I seem to remember her at least
five years ago in le Sphinx.


345
0:26:35,173 --> 0:26:39,144
I demand something different,
something fresh.


346
0:26:39,144 --> 0:26:42,581
But Your Excellency has seen
the most beautiful girls in the house!


347
0:26:42,581 --> 0:26:45,984
Damn it! Damn it!
I demand to see the director.


348
0:26:45,984 --> 0:26:49,621
But he does not concern himself
with the customers, Excellency.


349
0:26:49,621 --> 0:26:51,79
He will concern himself
with me, madame.


350
0:26:51,79 --> 0:26:54,259
You tell Monsieur Lucoville
to come here now!


351
0:26:54,259 --> 0:26:56,28
And get these creatures out of here!


352
0:26:56,28 --> 0:27:0,165
Of course, Excellency. Spank to your
pleasure, Your Excellency, Your Honor.


353
0:27:0,165 --> 0:27:3,702
Oh! Allez, vite!


354
0:27:3,702 --> 0:27:6,939
Good evening. I was recommended
to you by Lord Bostwick.


355
0:27:6,939 --> 0:27:9,408
Lord Bostwick?
Yes, he's a very old customer.


356
0:27:9,408 --> 0:27:12,978
He knows we like to cater
for the English taste.


357
0:27:12,978 --> 0:27:15,347
Nothing I can do will
please the gentleman.


358
0:27:15,347 --> 0:27:24,723
Nothing you can do. I don't wonder.
Let someone else try.


359
0:27:24,723 --> 0:27:27,793
Surely this is a place
of assignation?


360
0:27:27,793 --> 0:27:31,196
It is certainly not a convent.
Just stay here. I'll tell madame.


361
0:27:31,196 --> 0:27:35,133
How very interesting.


362
0:27:35,133 --> 0:27:36,902
I must make some notes.


363
0:27:36,902 --> 0:27:38,704
The count wants something different.


364
0:27:38,704 --> 0:27:48,981
- Excuse me. There is a new girl.
- No, not now.


365
0:27:48,981 --> 0:27:52,217
That's the most exciting
creature in the place!


366
0:27:52,217 --> 0:27:54,72
But she looks completely innocent.


367
0:27:54,72 --> 0:28:0,158
Yes, exactly.


368
0:28:0,158 --> 0:28:2,561
- I am the patron, mademoiselle.
- How do you do?


369
0:28:2,561 --> 0:28:4,329
Come this way, please.


370
0:28:4,329 --> 0:28:7,632
I wonder if I might ask
you one or two questions.


371
0:28:7,632 --> 0:28:19,711
Don't worry, cherie, he doesn't
want anyone experienced.


372
0:28:19,711 --> 0:28:25,417
Entrez.


373
0:28:25,417 --> 0:28:28,12
Your Excellency,
it is an honor to meet you.


374
0:28:28,12 --> 0:28:31,356
I have found you
something entirely fresh.


375
0:28:31,356 --> 0:28:35,494
What delightful surprises you
have up your sleeve, patron.


376
0:28:35,494 --> 0:28:39,865
In there. In there.


377
0:28:39,865 --> 0:28:44,69
For the exceptional customer,
there is always something...


378
0:28:44,69 --> 0:28:49,608
How shall I say... special.


379
0:28:49,608 --> 0:28:53,979
Special, yes. The room is to
your satisfaction, Excellency?


380
0:28:53,979 --> 0:28:56,982
They have sent you champagne.
It's on the house, of course.


381
0:28:56,982 --> 0:28:58,517
Oui, oui, oui, oui.


382
0:28:58,517 --> 0:29:0,752
Where is that girl?


383
0:29:0,752 --> 0:29:2,554
Where are you?


384
0:29:2,554 --> 0:29:6,24
Tell me. Are all the rooms
decorated in this fashion?


385
0:29:6,24 --> 0:29:9,494
What are you doing, girl? The count
doesn't want to be kept waiting.


386
0:29:9,494 --> 0:29:25,177
Get your clothes off.


387
0:29:25,177 --> 0:29:29,381
Dear, dear chairman, is this fair?


388
0:29:29,381 --> 0:29:31,917
- I am unarmed.
- Of course.


389
0:29:31,917 --> 0:29:34,52
You see, you're slack
as well as degenerate.


390
0:29:34,52 --> 0:29:36,588
I really must apologize...


391
0:29:36,588 --> 0:29:40,859
It's you.


392
0:29:40,859 --> 0:29:44,396
Pierre. Gaston. In there.


393
0:29:44,396 --> 0:29:46,164
What's a girl like
you doing here?


394
0:29:46,164 --> 0:29:49,34
- I thought it was a hotel.
- Break down the door.


395
0:29:49,34 --> 0:29:51,603
- Let's get out of the window.
- You stay here.


396
0:29:51,603 --> 0:29:53,772
You can't leave me
in a place like this.


397
0:29:53,772 --> 0:29:59,945
- Your bed, Miss Winter. You lie on it.
- Shoot off the lock.


398
0:29:59,945 --> 0:30:3,48
All right. Come on.


399
0:30:3,48 --> 0:30:6,618
Let's cut through here.


400
0:30:6,618 --> 0:30:13,125
No, perhaps not.


401
0:30:13,125 --> 0:30:17,162
It's a raid. It's a raid.
It's a raid.


402
0:30:17,162 --> 0:30:18,897
My God, it's a raid!
A raid, patron.


403
0:30:18,897 --> 0:30:22,134
- Don't panic, gentlemen!
- What's the meaning of this intrusion?


404
0:30:22,134 --> 0:30:24,97
A madman has seized
one of my girls against her will.


405
0:30:24,97 --> 0:30:27,139
- Impossible.
- Carry on, gentlemen!


406
0:30:27,139 --> 0:30:28,84
The emergency will soon be over.


407
0:30:28,84 --> 0:30:36,114
Jacques, champagne on the house
for our guests!


408
0:30:36,114 --> 0:30:41,119
Search the whole place!


409
0:30:41,119 --> 0:30:50,162
Oh, Mallon, my dear fellow,
how nice to see you. Au revoir.


410
0:30:50,162 --> 0:30:55,467
We must go in somewhere.


411
0:30:55,467 --> 0:30:57,736
I begin to suspect you're
protecting my virtue.


412
0:30:57,736 --> 0:31:1,706
I'm afraid it will have to
look after itself.


413
0:31:1,706 --> 0:31:5,944
You're too beautiful, cherie.
I dare not look at you.


414
0:31:5,944 --> 0:31:18,456
No! No! I can wait no longer!


415
0:31:18,456 --> 0:31:26,865
Quick! The stairs.


416
0:31:26,865 --> 0:32:3,969
No! Don't shoot the customers!


417
0:32:3,969 --> 0:32:5,503
In there, patron.


418
0:32:5,503 --> 0:32:7,806
Now we have him trapped.
Shoot the lock.


419
0:32:7,806 --> 0:32:17,249
It's no use, patron.
He's bolted the door.


420
0:32:17,249 --> 0:32:23,788
Very well. We'll smoke him out.


421
0:32:23,788 --> 0:32:26,258
- You've got us into a pretty pickle.
- I have?


422
0:32:26,258 --> 0:32:30,362
- You're not here at my invitation.
- Well, how do we get out?


423
0:32:30,362 --> 0:32:38,303
All problems are capable
of solution.


424
0:32:38,303 --> 0:32:44,376
Keep your guns ready.


425
0:32:44,376 --> 0:32:52,584
Gas.


426
0:32:52,584 --> 0:32:55,92
A laundry chute.
I told you there's always a solution.


427
0:32:55,92 --> 0:32:59,124
- It is exceedingly small.
- Fortunately, I am not too fat,


428
0:32:59,124 --> 0:33:0,859
and you are positively skinny.


429
0:33:0,859 --> 0:33:4,95
- Skinny.
- Come along.


430
0:33:4,95 --> 0:33:6,831
We've got a little while.
Get on the floor, please.


431
0:33:6,831 --> 0:33:9,2
- I beg your pardon!
- Gas.


432
0:33:9,2 --> 0:33:12,404
It's lighter than air.
It fills the room from the ceiling...


433
0:33:12,404 --> 0:33:14,339
...downwards.


434
0:33:14,339 --> 0:33:16,508
- It won't take long.
- Long enough.


435
0:33:16,508 --> 0:33:18,41
This commodious bag of yours


436
0:33:18,41 --> 0:33:31,356
wouldn't by any chance contain
such a thing as a first-aid kit, would it?


437
0:33:31,356 --> 0:33:34,326
Do not arrest anyone wearing
the Legion d'Honneur!


438
0:33:34,326 --> 0:33:37,829
Surely you do not wish to harm
that innocent young lady.


439
0:33:37,829 --> 0:33:43,268
Come out and face the music.


440
0:33:43,268 --> 0:33:46,838
When they burst the door open,
they'll strike these matches alight.


441
0:33:46,838 --> 0:33:52,977
The room will become a bomb.


442
0:33:52,977 --> 0:33:54,979
- Now, Miss Winter,
- Yes.


443
0:33:54,979 --> 0:33:59,217
I thought I told you to keep close
to the floor!


444
0:33:59,217 --> 0:34:3,54
- Yes, I will...
- Miss Winter?


445
0:34:3,54 --> 0:34:5,457
Inspector, we have nothing to hide.


446
0:34:5,457 --> 0:34:11,596
I assure you that this is a perfectly
respectable hotel.


447
0:34:11,596 --> 0:34:39,424
En avant!


448
0:34:39,424 --> 0:34:44,562
Now, open the door, lvan.


449
0:34:44,562 --> 0:34:46,898
We might even make a bargain.


450
0:34:46,898 --> 0:34:53,905
If I was to become vice chairman...


451
0:34:53,905 --> 0:34:55,607
He's drawing the bolts!


452
0:34:55,607 --> 0:34:58,209
I knew you'd see reason, lvan.


453
0:34:58,209 --> 0:35:3,481
I can't manage the lock.


454
0:35:3,481 --> 0:35:8,386
It's the gas! The gas!


455
0:35:8,386 --> 0:35:9,988
We'll have to break in.


456
0:35:9,988 --> 0:35:29,541
Quick, quick!
Break open the door!


457
0:35:29,541 --> 0:35:33,278
No, no, no!
Out of the way!


458
0:35:33,278 --> 0:35:37,816
I always say, if you want something
done, you've got to do it yourself.


459
0:35:37,816 --> 0:36:6,244
Stand back!
Champagne on the house!


460
0:36:6,244 --> 0:36:8,646
Come on, you.
No use hiding in here.


461
0:36:8,646 --> 0:36:10,81
Been at the bottle?


462
0:36:10,81 --> 0:36:33,137
Put her in the wagon
with the others.


463
0:36:33,137 --> 0:36:37,775
Let me go, please!
Let me go!


464
0:36:37,775 --> 0:36:41,613
I am a British citizen!


465
0:36:41,613 --> 0:37:6,938
I demand to see
the British ambassador!


466
0:37:6,938 --> 0:37:9,173
- Good morning.
- Good God.


467
0:37:9,173 --> 0:37:12,1
May I come in?
Thanks to those ridiculous policemen,


468
0:37:12,1 --> 0:37:13,611
I nearly missed the train.


469
0:37:13,611 --> 0:37:15,513
I thought I'd given you the slip.


470
0:37:15,513 --> 0:37:17,849
Thank you, it was
most considerate.


471
0:37:17,849 --> 0:37:21,386
There was a first-class ticket
to Zurich in the pocket.


472
0:37:21,386 --> 0:37:23,421
An oversight.


473
0:37:23,421 --> 0:37:26,624
Miss Winter, our rules do not allow
our clients to supervise


474
0:37:26,624 --> 0:37:28,66
the execution of their commissions.


475
0:37:28,66 --> 0:37:30,461
Oh, I'm not doing that.


476
0:37:30,461 --> 0:37:33,598
I'm just covering the story
in the course of my profession.


477
0:37:33,598 --> 0:37:36,67
Our records didn't show
you were a journalist.


478
0:37:36,67 --> 0:37:38,703
Well, this is my first assignment.


479
0:37:38,703 --> 0:37:41,306
Which newspaper
are you writing for?


480
0:37:41,306 --> 0:37:43,708
For the Daily...


481
0:37:43,708 --> 0:37:46,21
For the Daily Press, at large.


482
0:37:46,21 --> 0:37:48,78
Women are not yet accepted
in journalism.


483
0:37:48,78 --> 0:37:51,449
But when I have this story,
anyone will employ me.


484
0:37:51,449 --> 0:37:53,718
It will strike a great blow for women.


485
0:37:53,718 --> 0:37:56,12
Well, Miss Winter...


486
0:37:56,12 --> 0:38:0,525
...if anybody is to write the story
of this epic adventure,


487
0:38:0,525 --> 0:38:3,394
- it is only right that it should be you.
- Thank you.


488
0:38:3,394 --> 0:38:6,965
And since you're to be my constant
shadow, I suppose I'd better feed you.


489
0:38:6,965 --> 0:38:20,345
Shall we adjourn to the dining car
for luncheon?


490
0:38:20,345 --> 0:38:22,513
But how can I accept
your point of view?


491
0:38:22,513 --> 0:38:24,415
To take life is
the ultimate wrong.


492
0:38:24,415 --> 0:38:27,418
- It's basic to all civilized ethics.
- Really.


493
0:38:27,418 --> 0:38:30,488
You accept the gallows,
guillotine and the gas chamber.


494
0:38:30,488 --> 0:38:34,292
And not to mention the field of battle.


495
0:38:34,292 --> 0:38:37,395
- Brandy?
- No, thank you. I never touch spirits.


496
0:38:37,395 --> 0:38:41,32
Pity. Taken in moderation,
it can greatly clarify the mind.


497
0:38:41,32 --> 0:38:44,502
Thank you. My mind is perfectly clear
on one topic concerning us:


498
0:38:44,502 --> 0:38:46,37
All killing is wrong.


499
0:38:46,37 --> 0:38:49,574
- And yet you commissioned mine.
- That was quite different.


500
0:38:49,574 --> 0:38:51,876
You don't go into
a butcher to buy a steak


501
0:38:51,876 --> 0:38:54,512
and question his morality
in killing the cow.


502
0:38:54,512 --> 0:38:57,882
Really, you're impossible.
I shall return to my carriage.


503
0:38:57,882 --> 0:39:0,118
- Shall I accompany you?
- No, thank you.


504
0:39:0,118 --> 0:39:11,162
I'm sure you are the one
in need of the brandy.


505
0:39:11,162 --> 0:39:13,798
- Cognac, monsieur?
- Please.


506
0:39:13,798 --> 0:39:15,667
Thank you.


507
0:39:15,667 --> 0:39:19,971
- Excellent, an '88.
- Anything further, sir?


508
0:39:19,971 --> 0:39:28,112
- Just a cigar, thank you.
- A cigar.


509
0:39:28,112 --> 0:39:29,814
That'll be all, thank you.


510
0:39:29,814 --> 0:39:36,954
Not quite all, lvan.


511
0:39:36,954 --> 0:39:43,161
Popescu?


512
0:39:43,161 --> 0:39:45,263
What a marvelous makeup.


513
0:39:45,263 --> 0:39:47,865
You know, these new
Leichner waxes are fantastic!


514
0:39:47,865 --> 0:39:52,97
Thank you, lvan. And now
there is much sadness in the world,


515
0:39:52,97 --> 0:39:55,606
and there must be a little more.


516
0:39:55,606 --> 0:39:58,843
Won't you at least permit me
to finish my brandy and cigar?


517
0:39:58,843 --> 0:40:1,512
The drink certainly,
the cigar will take too long.


518
0:40:1,512 --> 0:40:5,75
The kitchen staff won't
stay locked in the galley forever.


519
0:40:5,75 --> 0:40:9,22
While you were enjoying yourself
in Paris, lvan,


520
0:40:9,22 --> 0:40:11,956
I was preparing this operation.


521
0:40:11,956 --> 0:40:34,178
You will admit it has
the merit of surprise.


522
0:40:34,178 --> 0:40:36,514
What's this?


523
0:40:36,514 --> 0:40:40,752
"Popescu...
Romanian businessman...


524
0:40:40,752 --> 0:40:46,257
"...falls from Paris-Zurich express..."
Et cetera...


525
0:40:46,257 --> 0:40:48,76
"...burns on body"?


526
0:40:48,76 --> 0:40:50,695
What did that young devil
do to him?


527
0:40:50,695 --> 0:40:53,397
The toast is absent friends.


528
0:40:53,397 --> 0:40:55,366
Lucoville was a fool.


529
0:40:55,366 --> 0:40:58,603
Any business with women
is bad business.


530
0:40:58,603 --> 0:41:1,105
But Popescu will be a great loss.


531
0:41:1,105 --> 0:41:4,8
Does your agent report
where our chairman is now?


532
0:41:4,8 --> 0:41:6,41
Not yet. But she is
a very able young woman,


533
0:41:6,41 --> 0:41:12,817
and I'm sure that we shall hear
something quite soon.


534
0:41:12,817 --> 0:41:15,286
That idiot in Liechtenstein!


535
0:41:15,286 --> 0:41:17,855
His talent lay in company fraud.


536
0:41:17,855 --> 0:41:22,627
Certainly not in handling explosives.


537
0:41:22,627 --> 0:41:25,163
Things are not going well, Muntzov.


538
0:41:25,163 --> 0:41:27,498
I want this matter finished quickly.


539
0:41:27,498 --> 0:41:32,136
Political tension is growing in Europe.
The Bureau is the instrument I need.


540
0:41:32,136 --> 0:41:34,438
Weiss understands the value
of money.


541
0:41:34,438 --> 0:41:40,211
I'm sure we can rely on
Swiss efficiency in Zurich.


542
0:41:40,211 --> 0:41:43,8
Suspect everyone!


543
0:41:43,8 --> 0:41:46,5
Do you understand? Everyone.


544
0:41:46,5 --> 0:41:54,792
The man is a master of disguises.
Better to be safe than sorry.


545
0:41:54,792 --> 0:41:57,261
- If we spot him, what do we do?
- I told you.


546
0:41:57,261 --> 0:42:1,32
Ring the bell to my office.
But on no account


547
0:42:1,32 --> 0:42:11,209
wink an eyelid even.
Otherwise, you are a dead man.


548
0:42:11,209 --> 0:42:16,714
Right. Go to your places, everyone!


549
0:42:16,714 --> 0:42:56,254
Open the doors!


550
0:42:56,254 --> 0:42:58,289
Is this where they keep the money?


551
0:42:58,289 --> 0:43:1,392
Well, yes, mein Herr.


552
0:43:1,392 --> 0:43:4,695
What? What did you require?


553
0:43:4,695 --> 0:43:9,901
The mountains are full of thieves.
Nothing is safe.


554
0:43:9,901 --> 0:43:14,705
Bad luck, lvan!
You don't fool me with this, my boy.


555
0:43:14,705 --> 0:43:16,841
In Switzerland we are efficient, yes?


556
0:43:16,841 --> 0:43:21,479
What are you doing?
My box! Take care of my box!


557
0:43:21,479 --> 0:43:23,281
The box.


558
0:43:23,281 --> 0:43:26,384
Of course. The box.


559
0:43:26,384 --> 0:43:29,186
- Throw it out into the street.
- What?


560
0:43:29,186 --> 0:43:31,822
Throw it out before it goes off.


561
0:43:31,822 --> 0:43:34,392
The game is up, lvan.


562
0:43:34,392 --> 0:43:38,29
Come back! Come back!
My box! My savings!


563
0:43:38,29 --> 0:43:39,897
Stop it, lvan.


564
0:43:39,897 --> 0:43:45,569
The game is up.


565
0:43:45,569 --> 0:43:57,648
Das geht zu weit.


566
0:43:57,648 --> 0:44:0,451
I never know if I can trust you.


567
0:44:0,451 --> 0:44:2,987
Dear, you know I might be
recognized anywhere.


568
0:44:2,987 --> 0:44:5,79
Simply hand it in for the attention
of the director.


569
0:44:5,79 --> 0:44:14,432
- That's all.
- Very well.


570
0:44:14,432 --> 0:44:16,334
- You're a villain.
- I beg you...


571
0:44:16,334 --> 0:44:19,904
Thief! Give me my money.


572
0:44:19,904 --> 0:44:22,34
They told me you would look
after my money.


573
0:44:22,34 --> 0:44:24,775
What do you do?
You throw it in the gutter!


574
0:44:24,775 --> 0:44:28,612
I want my money!
Give it to me!


575
0:44:28,612 --> 0:44:34,652
Excuse me.


576
0:44:34,652 --> 0:44:41,859
- Yes, mademoiselle.
- I have something for the director.


577
0:44:41,859 --> 0:44:43,294
What? What is it?


578
0:44:43,294 --> 0:44:53,504
Well, she has something
for the director.


579
0:44:53,504 --> 0:44:57,508
Half-wit. Idiot!


580
0:44:57,508 --> 0:45:0,945
My apologies, mademoiselle.


581
0:45:0,945 --> 0:45:6,25
Take it, man.
Put it in my office!


582
0:45:6,25 --> 0:45:11,822
A terrible misunderstanding,
mein Herr.


583
0:45:11,822 --> 0:45:17,61
Get away!


584
0:45:17,61 --> 0:45:20,64
What are you all standing here for?
Get back to work!


585
0:45:20,64 --> 0:45:29,507
All of you!
Get back to work.


586
0:45:29,507 --> 0:45:32,309
What exactly was in that case?


587
0:45:32,309 --> 0:45:36,247
Purely technical details. They belong
to our research department.


588
0:45:36,247 --> 0:45:39,35
We have some very brilliant scientists
working for us.


589
0:45:39,35 --> 0:45:52,463
When they make a discovery, they
deposit their secrets in a safe place.


590
0:45:52,463 --> 0:46:30,868
I think they'll be pleased
with the result.


591
0:46:30,868 --> 0:46:33,804
There is no one in the army
to match you, Herr General.


592
0:46:33,804 --> 0:46:36,64
- Congratulations, Herr General.
- Congratulate him.


593
0:46:36,64 --> 0:46:40,277
It is not a disgrace to be beaten
by the ex-champion of Germany.


594
0:46:40,277 --> 0:46:43,781
You will bear the scars of
your general's saber.


595
0:46:43,781 --> 0:46:47,451
Carry them with honor, lieutenant.


596
0:46:47,451 --> 0:46:50,121
What is the army coming to?


597
0:46:50,121 --> 0:46:54,24
- Take him away and stitch him up!
- A visitor, Herr General.


598
0:46:54,24 --> 0:46:55,593
Lord Bostwick.


599
0:46:55,593 --> 0:46:58,62
General, I'm glad you're keeping
your hand in.


600
0:46:58,62 --> 0:47:0,831
I'm just from Essen.
Alfred Krupp sends his regards.


601
0:47:0,831 --> 0:47:3,4
- Can we talk privately?
- Leave us.


602
0:47:3,4 --> 0:47:8,139
- You've heard the news from Zurich?
- So much for the efficient Swiss.


603
0:47:8,139 --> 0:47:13,477
Ja, ja. Always one must be alert.
And to be alert, you must be fit.


604
0:47:13,477 --> 0:47:18,315
En garde!


605
0:47:18,315 --> 0:47:19,95
Absent friends.


606
0:47:19,95 --> 0:47:22,486
For heaven's sake, stop it, Muntzov!


607
0:47:22,486 --> 0:47:25,55
I've a good mind to send you
back to Petrograd.


608
0:47:25,55 --> 0:47:28,259
No, no, we don't want
to risk any more of us.


609
0:47:28,259 --> 0:47:30,161
Well, this fooling
has got to stop.


610
0:47:30,161 --> 0:47:32,863
What good is the Bureau
with its best members gone?


611
0:47:32,863 --> 0:47:34,865
The cream still remains.


612
0:47:34,865 --> 0:47:37,101
Prove it, general, in Vienna.


613
0:47:37,101 --> 0:47:39,403
Our young chairman
is on his way there now.


614
0:47:39,403 --> 0:47:44,275
- We have no one in Vienna.
- Send someone.


615
0:47:44,275 --> 0:47:47,678
It will be arranged.


616
0:47:47,678 --> 0:47:52,783
To poor lvan.


617
0:47:52,783 --> 0:47:58,389
Drunken idiot. Young Dragomiloff
is worth ten of you.


618
0:47:58,389 --> 0:48:2,92
What a tragedy that he lacks
the vision to go along with me.


619
0:48:2,92 --> 0:48:6,33
His whole romantic notion
on moral killing is out-of-date.


620
0:48:6,33 --> 0:48:9,133
If only he could realize
that our organization


621
0:48:9,133 --> 0:48:13,237
is the most lethal instrument
of power ever conceived.


622
0:48:13,237 --> 0:48:17,775
The Assassination Bureau is
a political weapon or it is nothing.


623
0:48:17,775 --> 0:48:19,51
Properly used, as I can use it,


624
0:48:19,51 --> 0:48:24,848
it could bring down governments,
dynasties and empires.


625
0:48:24,848 --> 0:48:28,852
I could rule the destiny of Europe.


626
0:48:28,852 --> 0:48:32,489
Great things are afoot.


627
0:48:32,489 --> 0:48:36,827
Sell everything you possess, my
friends, and buy shares in armaments.


628
0:48:36,827 --> 0:48:40,931
Krupp, Skoda, Vickers-Armstrong.
Take your pick.


629
0:48:40,931 --> 0:49:42,459
Europe is already in ferment!


630
0:49:42,459 --> 0:49:44,862
- Good morning, Miss Winter.
- Good morning.


631
0:49:44,862 --> 0:49:48,332
- You evidently sleep well in Vienna.
- A luxury I appreciate.


632
0:49:48,332 --> 0:49:51,835
Our bureau hasn't a branch here.
A day off is a pleasant prospect.


633
0:49:51,835 --> 0:49:55,673
Are you impressed with the
emperor's forces? Thank you.


634
0:49:55,673 --> 0:49:59,91
How ridiculous men are. All this
dressing up and rattling of sabers.


635
0:49:59,91 --> 0:50:2,813
Who's that barbarous gentleman
taking the salute?


636
0:50:2,813 --> 0:50:6,684
Prince Ferdinand of Ruthenia.
He's Austria's Balkan puppet.


637
0:50:6,684 --> 0:50:10,487
He's here in Vienna to be impressed
by his master's military might.


638
0:50:10,487 --> 0:50:14,792
When will we learn that force
is meaningless?


639
0:50:14,792 --> 0:50:17,594
Never. After all,
you're paying to have me killed


640
0:50:17,594 --> 0:50:21,465
because you believe
that you are right and I am wrong.


641
0:50:21,465 --> 0:50:30,341
It's nothing personal.
It's just that...


642
0:50:30,341 --> 0:50:36,513
Oh, my God!


643
0:50:36,513 --> 0:50:41,352
Die, Ruthenian dogs,
long live Carpathia!


644
0:50:41,352 --> 0:50:50,561
Long live Carpathia!


645
0:50:50,561 --> 0:50:52,329
Thank you, Miss Winter.


646
0:50:52,329 --> 0:50:55,432
- I... I thought...
- That the bullet was meant for me.


647
0:50:55,432 --> 0:50:58,402
Sadly, I have no monopoly
in the assassination business.


648
0:50:58,402 --> 0:51:1,405
- Now, I insist you have a brandy.
- No, thank you, I...


649
0:51:1,405 --> 0:51:4,742
Your mind needs clarifying.
You're paying to have me killed,


650
0:51:4,742 --> 0:51:7,411
yet when you think I might be,
you try to save me.


651
0:51:7,411 --> 0:51:10,481
A revelation comparable
with Saint Paul's at Tarsus.


652
0:51:10,481 --> 0:51:52,122
Surely that calls for a celebration.


653
0:51:52,122 --> 0:51:54,525
I'm quite out of breath.


654
0:51:54,525 --> 0:51:57,761
- You're a very good dancer.
- Of course.


655
0:51:57,761 --> 0:52:1,98
My father liked me
to excel... in everything.


656
0:52:1,98 --> 0:52:4,802
Your father. You know something,
I don't think you've really grown up.


657
0:52:4,802 --> 0:52:8,105
- I was born old.
- Well, maybe that's the trouble.


658
0:52:8,105 --> 0:52:12,75
Now, while we're in Vienna,
there's a certain Professor Freud...


659
0:52:12,75 --> 0:52:13,51
Don't mention that name.


660
0:52:13,51 --> 0:52:17,314
To meddle with my basic instincts
would be professional suicide.


661
0:52:17,314 --> 0:52:31,128
That's what I had in mind.


662
0:52:31,128 --> 0:52:34,231
- I like it here.
- Good.


663
0:52:34,231 --> 0:52:48,645
You wait till you taste the Blutwurst.
Where's that waiter got to?


664
0:52:48,645 --> 0:52:53,15
Get me his apron.
Put the bomb inside the sausage.


665
0:52:53,15 --> 0:52:55,652
Quickly, man, and be careful.
Mind the knife!


666
0:52:55,652 --> 0:53:2,793
The slightest touch of metal
will set it off.


667
0:53:2,793 --> 0:53:6,563
Drink to the days
The days going by


668
0:53:6,563 --> 0:53:9,933
Some day we'll meet again


669
0:53:9,933 --> 0:53:13,804
Remember me till then


670
0:53:13,804 --> 0:53:15,706
While we're young
While we're young


671
0:53:15,706 --> 0:53:17,674
There are songs to be sung


672
0:53:17,674 --> 0:53:21,345
And a pledge that's warm and gay


673
0:53:21,345 --> 0:53:25,549
"I promise to
Remember you


674
0:53:25,549 --> 0:53:28,986
"The way you are today"


675
0:53:28,986 --> 0:53:31,121
While we're young
While we're young


676
0:53:31,121 --> 0:53:33,56
There are songs to be sung


677
0:53:33,56 --> 0:53:37,694
And a pledge that's warm and gay


678
0:53:37,694 --> 0:53:39,129
Excellencies.


679
0:53:39,129 --> 0:53:43,1
The Archduke Ferdinand of Ruthenia
has decided to visit this establishment.


680
0:53:43,1 --> 0:53:44,635
It is an honor, Excellency.


681
0:53:44,635 --> 0:53:46,537
His Highness wants
some relaxation.


682
0:53:46,537 --> 0:53:49,206
We were against it,
after this morning's incident.


683
0:53:49,206 --> 0:53:51,575
You must see that everything
is in order.


684
0:53:51,575 --> 0:53:54,444
Of course. This is a most
respectable establishment.


685
0:53:54,444 --> 0:54:9,259
I hope not. I told you,
he wanted some relaxation.


686
0:54:9,259 --> 0:54:16,733
Now, leave it to me and get out!


687
0:54:16,733 --> 0:54:20,404
Lift up your glass on high


688
0:54:20,404 --> 0:54:25,8
Drink to the days
The days going by


689
0:54:25,8 --> 0:54:28,512
Some day we'll meet again


690
0:54:28,512 --> 0:54:32,149
Remember me till then


691
0:54:32,149 --> 0:54:34,84
While we're young
While we're young


692
0:54:34,84 --> 0:54:35,686
There are songs to be sung


693
0:54:35,686 --> 0:54:39,456
And a pledge that's warm and gay


694
0:54:39,456 --> 0:54:43,26
"I promise to
Remember you


695
0:54:43,26 --> 0:54:46,797
"The way you are today"


696
0:54:46,797 --> 0:54:48,765
While we're young
While we're young


697
0:54:48,765 --> 0:54:50,534
There are songs to be sung


698
0:54:50,534 --> 0:54:54,204
And a pledge that's warm and gay


699
0:54:54,204 --> 0:54:57,908
"I promise to
Remember you


700
0:54:57,908 --> 0:55:0,444
"The way you are today"


701
0:55:0,444 --> 0:55:2,846
- The Blutwurst.
- Here we are, mein Herr,


702
0:55:2,846 --> 0:55:7,918
the riesen Blutwurst,
the greatest delicacy in all Vienna.


703
0:55:7,918 --> 0:55:12,723
The pigs for the Blutwurst are bred
here in our Vienna woods.


704
0:55:12,723 --> 0:55:16,93
They were slaughtered
only this morning.


705
0:55:16,93 --> 0:55:20,797
The blood must be quite fresh.
Yes, yes.


706
0:55:20,797 --> 0:55:23,266
In Vienna we have the best
of everything.


707
0:55:23,266 --> 0:55:24,868
Enjoy yourselves.


708
0:55:24,868 --> 0:55:29,94
And drink it down, down
Down, down, down


709
0:55:29,94 --> 0:55:34,711
Down, down, down
Down, down


710
0:55:34,711 --> 0:55:38,81
Lift up your glass on high


711
0:55:38,81 --> 0:55:40,617
Drink to the days
The days gone by


712
0:55:40,617 --> 0:55:42,52
Waiter!


713
0:55:42,52 --> 0:55:44,688
Some day we'll meet again


714
0:55:44,688 --> 0:55:48,892
Remember me till then


715
0:55:48,892 --> 0:55:52,396
Lift up your glass on high


716
0:55:52,396 --> 0:55:56,5
A sausage! But what did I say?
This is indeed a place of fun!


717
0:55:56,5 --> 0:55:58,769
Excellency, apologies. Allow me.


718
0:55:58,769 --> 0:56:0,704
No, no, no. Put it on the table.


719
0:56:0,704 --> 0:56:4,107
The Blutwurst is my favorite dish.


720
0:56:4,107 --> 0:56:5,742
Bring me a knife.


721
0:56:5,742 --> 0:56:10,247
- Come on!
- But why? Why are we going?


722
0:56:10,247 --> 0:56:15,686
You're acting completely like a lunatic!
It was just warming up in there.


723
0:56:15,686 --> 0:56:23,226
Evidently.


724
0:56:23,226 --> 0:56:26,797
- That poor man.
- Archduke Ferdie?


725
0:56:26,797 --> 0:56:30,233
Waste no tears on him.
A petty tyrant, if ever there was one.


726
0:56:30,233 --> 0:56:33,804
An historic event. You should
make an excellent journalist.


727
0:56:33,804 --> 0:56:36,239
You're always on the spot.


728
0:56:36,239 --> 0:56:39,443
- But that bomb was meant for you.
- Precisely.


729
0:56:39,443 --> 0:56:42,446
I thought you said the Bureau
had no one here in Vienna.


730
0:56:42,446 --> 0:56:44,347
They sent someone.


731
0:56:44,347 --> 0:56:51,288
I wonder how they knew I was here.


732
0:56:51,288 --> 0:56:54,524
Perhaps you've been followed.


733
0:56:54,524 --> 0:56:58,628
- Indeed. I have, my dear. By you.
- Me?


734
0:56:58,628 --> 0:57:1,164
At Lord Bostwick's command,
no doubt.


735
0:57:1,164 --> 0:57:3,266
How did you know?
He said not to say...


736
0:57:3,266 --> 0:57:6,403
He also didn't tell you he's
vice chairman of our bureau.


737
0:57:6,403 --> 0:57:9,873
Lord Bostwick?


738
0:57:9,873 --> 0:57:12,809
- I can't believe it.
- A man of many parts.


739
0:57:12,809 --> 0:57:16,58
- He's a villain.
- Well, he'll hear no more from you.


740
0:57:16,58 --> 0:57:20,317
On the contrary. I intend to
keep him fully informed.


741
0:57:20,317 --> 0:57:21,885
You what?


742
0:57:21,885 --> 0:57:25,55
I want to know exactly why
he wants control of the Bureau.


743
0:57:25,55 --> 0:57:30,293
I shall wire him at once
you're on your way to Venice.


744
0:57:30,293 --> 0:57:32,496
Can't you make any more
of it than this?


745
0:57:32,496 --> 0:57:35,899
- There's nothing but facts!
- We mustn't inflame the situation.


746
0:57:35,899 --> 0:57:40,103
Ruthenia and Carpathia are puppets!
Russia and Austria pull the strings.


747
0:57:40,103 --> 0:57:42,372
So punch in some big headlines:


748
0:57:42,372 --> 0:57:46,143
"Russia Warns Austria"!
"Austria Warns Russia"!


749
0:57:46,143 --> 0:57:48,478
"The Kaiser Summons
his General Staff"!


750
0:57:48,478 --> 0:57:50,881
You have private sources
of information?


751
0:57:50,881 --> 0:57:52,883
Of course. So get on with it, man.


752
0:57:52,883 --> 0:57:56,987
We're running a newspaper.
Give them news!


753
0:57:56,987 --> 0:57:59,956
This is a stroke of luck, Muntzov.


754
0:57:59,956 --> 0:58:2,692
Ferdinand's death is the spark
I needed. Cheer up.


755
0:58:2,692 --> 0:58:5,228
To a Russian,
death is a serious matter.


756
0:58:5,228 --> 0:58:8,899
- Life is no joke, either.
- But time is running out.


757
0:58:8,899 --> 0:58:11,1
I've got my new members picked.


758
0:58:11,1 --> 0:58:14,638
But I need the Bureau
in my hands now.


759
0:58:14,638 --> 0:58:18,8
We must make sure once
and for all in Venice.


760
0:58:18,8 --> 0:58:23,18
Thank heaven for Cesare Spado.
He has all the skill of the Borgias.


761
0:58:23,18 --> 0:58:27,784
All my friends in London tell me
I'm getting a little fat.


762
0:58:27,784 --> 0:58:33,59
I can't resist.


763
0:58:33,59 --> 0:58:37,627
My dearest one! You haven't put
vanilla in the zabaglione!


764
0:58:37,627 --> 0:58:41,698
You know how I dislike it!


765
0:58:41,698 --> 0:58:45,202
Nonsense, Cesare.
Just peel of tangerine.


766
0:58:45,202 --> 0:58:49,39
I prepared it myself.
There's not a drop of vanilla in it.


767
0:58:49,39 --> 0:58:51,107
I can taste it distinctly.


768
0:58:51,107 --> 0:58:54,778
There is positively no vanilla
in the zabaglione.


769
0:58:54,778 --> 0:58:59,49
Taste it again.


770
0:58:59,49 --> 0:59:0,55
Perhaps you're right.


771
0:59:0,55 --> 0:59:4,12
Eat it up now or I shall be
very offended.


772
0:59:4,12 --> 0:59:6,923
I will not speak to you.


773
0:59:6,923 --> 0:59:10,26
Or let you...


774
0:59:10,26 --> 0:59:14,998
No, no, no.
Eleanora, my angel...


775
0:59:14,998 --> 0:59:17,67
It's delicious.


776
0:59:17,67 --> 0:59:19,703
I tell everyone your cooking
is supreme.


777
0:59:19,703 --> 0:59:22,572
The taste has quite disappeared.


778
0:59:22,572 --> 0:59:28,678
You've outdone yourself,
my darling.


779
0:59:28,678 --> 0:59:31,815
Eleanora, my dear,
it's just possible that a man


780
0:59:31,815 --> 0:59:34,684
with whom I have business
connections may call here.


781
0:59:34,684 --> 0:59:37,52
- I would prefer not to see him.
- As you wish.


782
0:59:37,52 --> 0:59:41,57
His name is Dragomiloff,
but he may not declare himself.


783
0:59:41,57 --> 0:59:44,261
I would like you to describe carefully
anyone who may call.


784
0:59:44,261 --> 0:59:57,474
What a dreadful fuss.


785
0:59:57,474 --> 0:59:59,209
This is our finest view,


786
0:59:59,209 --> 1:0:2,45
the room Signor Dragomiloff
always prefers, signora.


787
1:0:2,45 --> 1:0:6,82
You will see the sun rise up behind
the Santa Maria della Salute.


788
1:0:6,82 --> 1:0:9,352
- A sight never to be forgotten.
- A little misunderstanding.


789
1:0:9,352 --> 1:0:12,489
I am not a signora and therefore
require a separate room.


790
1:0:12,489 --> 1:0:14,791
Scusi, signorina.
What a pity.


791
1:0:14,791 --> 1:0:17,494
I hope you have another
equally delightful room.


792
1:0:17,494 --> 1:0:19,696
The room, yes, signor.
The view, no.


793
1:0:19,696 --> 1:0:23,166
- I have only a room at the back.
- Then she must have this room.


794
1:0:23,166 --> 1:0:24,668
- Oh, no.
- No, I insist.


795
1:0:24,668 --> 1:0:27,504
Take my luggage to whatever room.
I'll see you later.


796
1:0:27,504 --> 1:0:31,41
It is a very delightful room, signor.
You will be most comfortable.


797
1:0:31,41 --> 1:0:35,578
I'm sure I will.
Thank you very much indeed.


798
1:0:35,578 --> 1:0:38,181
Well, it seems we have
a married look.


799
1:0:38,181 --> 1:0:40,35
Because you're after my blood,
no doubt.


800
1:0:40,35 --> 1:0:45,689
Don't talk nonsense.
We've got no time to waste.


801
1:0:45,689 --> 1:0:48,124
- What are you doing?
- Can't be too careful.


802
1:0:48,124 --> 1:0:54,798
My dear friend Spado might have
left me a welcoming present.


803
1:0:54,798 --> 1:0:57,367
That's all clear.
Bombs aren't the Italian line.


804
1:0:57,367 --> 1:1:1,671
They prefer more subtle methods.


805
1:1:1,671 --> 1:1:5,842
Well, the sooner you talk to him
the better. Isn't it time you left?


806
1:1:5,842 --> 1:1:9,546
Miss Winter.


807
1:1:9,546 --> 1:1:11,781
Since our relationship
became less formal,


808
1:1:11,781 --> 1:1:14,718
I observe a tendency
on your part to nag.


809
1:1:14,718 --> 1:1:19,155
- Sometimes you can be very irritating.
- I have been told that.


810
1:1:19,155 --> 1:1:22,859
Stay here until I return, understand?
Absolutely no one is allowed in.


811
1:1:22,859 --> 1:1:26,62
If you sleep, lock the windows.
The balcony's an easy climb.


812
1:1:26,62 --> 1:1:29,466
To be on the safe side,
I will lock you in and keep the key.


813
1:1:29,466 --> 1:1:32,68
But this is absurd.
If Spado is so dangerous,


814
1:1:32,68 --> 1:1:34,804
how can you hope to win him over
to our plan?


815
1:1:34,804 --> 1:1:37,4
Cesare and my father
were very close.


816
1:1:37,4 --> 1:1:39,42
I doubt he'd go the way
of the others


817
1:1:39,42 --> 1:1:41,745
had it not been
for such a demanding wife.


818
1:1:41,745 --> 1:1:45,582
- As usual, the woman gets the blame.
- Not without good cause, I gather.


819
1:1:45,582 --> 1:1:48,785
I'm told that Signora Spado
has considerable charms


820
1:1:48,785 --> 1:1:53,69
and doesn't hesitate
to use them.


821
1:1:53,69 --> 1:1:55,792
She hasn't your high principles.


822
1:1:55,792 --> 1:1:58,194
Your self-denial is
really quite remarkable.


823
1:1:58,194 --> 1:2:4,534
A woman's beauty
can be a lethal weapon.


824
1:2:4,534 --> 1:2:7,737
- My God.
- My darling, what can it be?


825
1:2:7,737 --> 1:2:10,473
Is it something you have eaten?


826
1:2:10,473 --> 1:2:12,75
It's working.


827
1:2:12,75 --> 1:2:19,616
The poison,
it's doing its work.


828
1:2:19,616 --> 1:2:21,951
Poison?


829
1:2:21,951 --> 1:2:24,687
What are you saying, Cesare?


830
1:2:24,687 --> 1:2:27,624
How could he have managed it?


831
1:2:27,624 --> 1:2:31,294
He? Who are you talking of,
my darling?


832
1:2:31,294 --> 1:2:33,73
The son of my old friend
and comrade.


833
1:2:33,73 --> 1:2:36,8
I had arranged his death,
but he has got me first.


834
1:2:36,8 --> 1:2:40,437
- Cesare, you're delirious.
- There is so much I must tell you.


835
1:2:40,437 --> 1:2:49,746
Lie still.
Angelo has gone for a doctor.


836
1:2:49,746 --> 1:2:51,748
You must hear it all.


837
1:2:51,748 --> 1:2:54,851
This business I am in
with this man Dragomiloff,


838
1:2:54,851 --> 1:3:0,623
it is called...


839
1:3:0,623 --> 1:3:8,398
...the Assassination Bureau.


840
1:3:8,398 --> 1:3:12,335
This Englishman lord
will pay 10,000 pounds


841
1:3:12,335 --> 1:3:14,37
for this man Dragomiloff's death?


842
1:3:14,37 --> 1:3:19,42
Pieces of silver.
Pieces of silver.


843
1:3:19,42 --> 1:3:21,444
Many pieces.


844
1:3:21,444 --> 1:3:24,447
Can you forgive me?


845
1:3:24,447 --> 1:3:29,352
It was for you that I did
these dreadful things.


846
1:3:29,352 --> 1:3:34,23
But you are so tender, so innocent.


847
1:3:34,23 --> 1:4:2,652
What can you know
of assassination?


848
1:4:2,652 --> 1:4:10,693
Life flows along


849
1:4:10,693 --> 1:4:19,302
Just like a boat on a river


850
1:4:19,302 --> 1:4:25,375
All that I want is to


851
1:4:25,375 --> 1:4:29,712
Find a place


852
1:4:29,712 --> 1:4:35,318
Safe in the harbor


853
1:4:35,318 --> 1:4:40,123
Of love's embrace


854
1:4:40,123 --> 1:4:42,792
Good evening.


855
1:4:42,792 --> 1:4:45,795
- Forgive my entering unannounced.
- Who are you?


856
1:4:45,795 --> 1:4:48,798
- A friend of your husband.
- My husband is away.


857
1:4:48,798 --> 1:4:51,1
Strange.


858
1:4:51,1 --> 1:4:53,536
He knew I was coming.


859
1:4:53,536 --> 1:4:56,639
We had some business
to do together.


860
1:4:56,639 --> 1:5:0,81
You... You haven't told me
your name.


861
1:5:0,81 --> 1:5:3,98
My name is...


862
1:5:3,98 --> 1:5:9,18
...lvan Dragomiloff.


863
1:5:9,18 --> 1:5:12,88
Signor Dragomiloff.


864
1:5:12,88 --> 1:5:16,492
I've heard him talk
so often about you.


865
1:5:16,492 --> 1:5:19,462
I feel we are old friends.


866
1:5:19,462 --> 1:5:21,97
Me too.


867
1:5:21,97 --> 1:5:26,469
I have heard much about you.
Cesare is a... A lucky man.


868
1:5:26,469 --> 1:5:30,6
May I ask you
where he has gone?


869
1:5:30,6 --> 1:5:31,441
I don't know.


870
1:5:31,441 --> 1:5:34,344
He's just, well, floating around.


871
1:5:34,344 --> 1:5:37,18
Since you are alone,
my presence might compromise you.


872
1:5:37,18 --> 1:5:41,5
- Perhaps I should go.
- No, no. We'll have a glass of wine.


873
1:5:41,5 --> 1:5:45,521
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.


874
1:5:45,521 --> 1:5:49,325
How much do you know
about his business?


875
1:5:49,325 --> 1:5:51,294
Oh, nothing.


876
1:5:51,294 --> 1:5:56,566
Well, then, you'll hardly be able
to make up for his absence, will you?


877
1:5:56,566 --> 1:6:6,509
I wouldn't say that.


878
1:6:6,509 --> 1:6:8,378
Will you think me
very wicked


879
1:6:8,378 --> 1:6:12,482
if I confess to being pleased
that Cesare is away?


880
1:6:12,482 --> 1:6:14,884
I would think you very flattering.


881
1:6:14,884 --> 1:6:17,754
But that's not the reason
why you made away with him.


882
1:6:17,754 --> 1:6:19,489
I what?!


883
1:6:19,489 --> 1:6:21,924
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.


884
1:6:21,924 --> 1:6:24,294
How dare you accuse me
of such a thing!


885
1:6:24,294 --> 1:6:25,928
Let's not have melodramatics.


886
1:6:25,928 --> 1:6:28,598
I saw your handsome gondolier
dispose of the body.


887
1:6:28,598 --> 1:6:30,33
Now please sit down.


888
1:6:30,33 --> 1:6:33,836
Perhaps we can come
to some arrangement.


889
1:6:33,836 --> 1:6:42,578
One moment.
Angelo, I must deal with him.


890
1:6:42,578 --> 1:6:44,514
- You have a man in.
- Not for long.


891
1:6:44,514 --> 1:6:47,55
- Long, short, what is the difference?
- Don't be a fool.


892
1:6:47,55 --> 1:6:50,53
He knows. He saw you.
He could destroy us.


893
1:6:50,53 --> 1:6:52,855
- Then I will fix him.
- I will.


894
1:6:52,855 --> 1:6:55,858
My way.


895
1:6:55,858 --> 1:6:58,27
Go and prepare the gondola,
then wait.


896
1:6:58,27 --> 1:7:6,102
I will ring when it is done.
It will be quick this time.


897
1:7:6,102 --> 1:7:9,205
You can't prove
your ridiculous accusation.


898
1:7:9,205 --> 1:7:10,773
I hope I won't have to.


899
1:7:10,773 --> 1:7:12,875
We have plenty of time
to talk it over.


900
1:7:12,875 --> 1:7:16,179
Then let's have
another glass of wine.


901
1:7:16,179 --> 1:7:20,717
Please, close the window.
The night has grown chilly.


902
1:7:20,717 --> 1:7:22,752
Even if what you say was true,


903
1:7:22,752 --> 1:7:29,192
wouldn't I have been merely doing
your job for you?


904
1:7:29,192 --> 1:7:32,28
You said you knew nothing
of your husband's business.


905
1:7:32,28 --> 1:7:43,206
Perhaps it is now my business.


906
1:7:43,206 --> 1:7:46,242
I'm sure that you'll handle it
very capably.


907
1:7:46,242 --> 1:7:51,814
Thank you.


908
1:7:51,814 --> 1:8:0,323
Please draw the curtains.


909
1:8:0,323 --> 1:8:2,725
It appears we understand
each other well.


910
1:8:2,725 --> 1:8:5,461
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.


911
1:8:5,461 --> 1:8:8,331
I told you I could take
my husband's place.


912
1:8:8,331 --> 1:8:13,236
What a delightful little table,
like a wheel of fortune.


913
1:8:13,236 --> 1:8:15,37
Our fortunes, it seems,


914
1:8:15,37 --> 1:8:16,572
are to be linked.


915
1:8:16,572 --> 1:8:19,509
- Shall we drink to that?
- I...


916
1:8:19,509 --> 1:8:23,479
- I can't drink to the unknown.
- You're not adventurous.


917
1:8:23,479 --> 1:8:49,672
I drink to it.


918
1:8:49,672 --> 1:8:53,543
Bellissima.


919
1:8:53,543 --> 1:8:55,578
Get rid of him.


920
1:8:55,578 --> 1:8:57,38
What a pity.


921
1:8:57,38 --> 1:9:0,65
He was so young.


922
1:9:0,65 --> 1:9:5,555
All that I want is to


923
1:9:5,555 --> 1:9:9,559
Find a place


924
1:9:9,559 --> 1:9:14,53
Safe in the harbor


925
1:9:14,53 --> 1:9:18,401
Of love's embrace


926
1:9:18,401 --> 1:12:38,834
How sweet...


927
1:12:38,834 --> 1:12:40,87
Fortunately, I kept wicket for Eton.


928
1:12:40,87 --> 1:12:44,473
- Oh, don't worry, I've turned it off.
- It...


929
1:12:44,473 --> 1:12:46,809
It was on the canopy.


930
1:12:46,809 --> 1:12:50,279
Splendid. I knew these new
time bombs would come in useful.


931
1:12:50,279 --> 1:12:55,51
Can't you talk anything but shop?
I've nearly been killed.


932
1:12:55,51 --> 1:12:58,32
Oh, I'm sorry.


933
1:12:58,32 --> 1:13:3,259
I am sorry.


934
1:13:3,259 --> 1:13:5,261
I'll never forgive myself.


935
1:13:5,261 --> 1:13:12,201
This room was meant for me.
I should never have left you here.


936
1:13:12,201 --> 1:13:16,305
What on earth are you doing
in that ridiculous costume?


937
1:13:16,305 --> 1:13:18,107
I forgot.


938
1:13:18,107 --> 1:13:23,779
I regret to have to inform you
that lvan Dragomiloff is now dead.


939
1:13:23,779 --> 1:13:26,749
- What?
- Yes, events took an unexpected turn.


940
1:13:26,749 --> 1:13:29,652
However, the first part of our plot
has been achieved.


941
1:13:29,652 --> 1:13:32,154
- You mean they think you're dead?
- Precisely.


942
1:13:32,154 --> 1:13:35,91
I shall now have to disappear
into hiding.


943
1:13:35,91 --> 1:13:40,663
And the rest, Miss Winter,
is up to you.


944
1:13:40,663 --> 1:13:59,381
Now, that's what I call
a really pretty dress.


945
1:13:59,381 --> 1:14:10,259
Miss Winter.


946
1:14:10,259 --> 1:14:20,35
Miss Winter, surrender.


947
1:14:20,35 --> 1:14:22,37
Why not?


948
1:14:22,37 --> 1:14:24,54
Surrender is no defeat...


949
1:14:24,54 --> 1:14:39,188
...for a woman.


950
1:14:39,188 --> 1:14:42,892
My friend has not returned to the hotel.
He's been out all night.


951
1:14:42,892 --> 1:14:45,694
I'm desperately afraid
he was run over.


952
1:14:45,694 --> 1:14:49,799
- In Venice, signorina?
- Well, fallen in a canal, anything.


953
1:14:49,799 --> 1:14:52,568
- Please, you must help me.
- Of course, signorina.


954
1:14:52,568 --> 1:14:55,271
- The name of your friend?
- Dragomiloff.


955
1:14:55,271 --> 1:14:57,306
Ivan Dragomiloff.


956
1:14:57,306 --> 1:15:11,487
One moment, signorina.


957
1:15:11,487 --> 1:15:14,89
Signorina, I am sorry.


958
1:15:14,89 --> 1:15:18,194
- I fear I have very bad news.
- What?


959
1:15:18,194 --> 1:15:20,129
- What is it?
- Your friend.


960
1:15:20,129 --> 1:15:23,365
There must have been an accident.
He has been drowned.


961
1:15:23,365 --> 1:15:32,274
His body has been taken
from the canal.


962
1:15:32,274 --> 1:15:35,711
- I'll be all right.
- There were papers with his name.


963
1:15:35,711 --> 1:15:44,887
But we would like you to identify
the body, if you are able.


964
1:15:44,887 --> 1:16:12,915
- Very well.
- Please come this way, signorina.


965
1:16:12,915 --> 1:16:15,15
It is...


966
1:16:15,15 --> 1:16:22,391
...he.


967
1:16:22,391 --> 1:16:40,743
This way, signorina.


968
1:16:40,743 --> 1:16:44,113
It... It... It is him.


969
1:16:44,113 --> 1:16:48,25
- Yes, we found papers on the body.
- Was Dragomiloff a good friend?


970
1:16:48,25 --> 1:16:51,186
He was the best friend
my husband had.


971
1:16:51,186 --> 1:16:53,122
We were very close.


972
1:16:53,122 --> 1:16:56,625
We will save you
any more pain, signora.


973
1:16:56,625 --> 1:17:0,95
I would be very glad if he could
be brought to my palazzo.


974
1:17:0,95 --> 1:17:5,434
It is not fitting that such a man
should lie here.


975
1:17:5,434 --> 1:17:7,87
Whatever the signora desires.


976
1:17:7,87 --> 1:17:9,838
We salvaged the gondola, signora.


977
1:17:9,838 --> 1:17:13,876
But alas, there is as yet
no sign of the gondolier.


978
1:17:13,876 --> 1:18:4,994
Poor Angelo.


979
1:18:4,994 --> 1:18:8,197
Poor Angelo's clothes
fit you perfectly.


980
1:18:8,197 --> 1:18:12,134
A little tight, perhaps,
because you are more muscular.


981
1:18:12,134 --> 1:18:14,37
I prefer that.


982
1:18:14,37 --> 1:18:16,205
Go to the undertakers.


983
1:18:16,205 --> 1:18:18,707
I want this gruesome thing removed


984
1:18:18,707 --> 1:18:21,71
as soon as my guests
have paid their respects.


985
1:18:21,71 --> 1:18:26,448
Well, come along, Piero.
Get on with it.


986
1:18:26,448 --> 1:18:43,599
I hope you're not going
to take liberties.


987
1:18:43,599 --> 1:18:48,27
Miss Winter?


988
1:18:48,27 --> 1:18:50,973
Miss Winter,
I hardly recognized you.


989
1:18:50,973 --> 1:18:53,275
- My congratulations.
- Lord Bostwick.


990
1:18:53,275 --> 1:18:56,845
I came as soon as I received
your telegram announcing his death.


991
1:18:56,845 --> 1:18:59,648
May I introduce an associate of mine,
Baron Muntzov.


992
1:18:59,648 --> 1:19:1,25
Well, my dear young lady,


993
1:19:1,25 --> 1:19:5,154
the press has once again shown itself
to be the conscience of the nation.


994
1:19:5,154 --> 1:19:8,9
Your story will be syndicated
all over the world.


995
1:19:8,9 --> 1:19:10,392
Come, we will go directly
to Spado's house,


996
1:19:10,392 --> 1:19:12,694
and pay our respects
to the dead.


997
1:19:12,694 --> 1:19:14,129
At Spado's house?


998
1:19:14,129 --> 1:19:15,931
But his body is at the morgue.


999
1:19:15,931 --> 1:19:20,369
As I so often find, my information
is more up-to-date than my reporters'.


1000
1:19:20,369 --> 1:19:23,539
Signora Spado's had the coffin
taken to her palazzo.


1001
1:19:23,539 --> 1:19:26,475
My lord. My lord.


1002
1:19:26,475 --> 1:19:30,913
I've just arrived from Berlin,
the news is grave.


1003
1:19:30,913 --> 1:19:35,15
Dragomiloff has gone
just in time.


1004
1:19:35,15 --> 1:19:38,287
Miss Winter, may I introduce
General von Pinck.


1005
1:19:38,287 --> 1:19:40,722
Collect the luggage
and bring Miss Winter.


1006
1:19:40,722 --> 1:19:48,63
The general and I will go on ahead.
We have important matters to discuss.


1007
1:19:48,63 --> 1:19:55,571
There's mobilization.
I must return tonight.


1008
1:19:55,571 --> 1:19:57,206
Will there be war?


1009
1:19:57,206 --> 1:20:0,309
Not yet, the kaiser's proposing
a secret peace conference.


1010
1:20:0,309 --> 1:20:3,479
- Indeed.
- He goes to Ruthenia for the funeral,


1011
1:20:3,479 --> 1:20:6,215
and that's where
the conference will take place.


1012
1:20:6,215 --> 1:20:10,252
They will all be there:
The English king. Tsar Nicholas.


1013
1:20:10,252 --> 1:20:13,322
The president of France.
The Austrian emperor. The...


1014
1:20:13,322 --> 1:20:16,458
Spare me this catalog
of mediocrity.


1015
1:20:16,458 --> 1:20:25,2
All this may suit me very well.


1016
1:20:25,2 --> 1:20:27,903
Signora Spado, my greetings
and congratulations.


1017
1:20:27,903 --> 1:20:30,272
My colleague, General von Pinck.


1018
1:20:30,272 --> 1:20:32,975
My husband is away.
I had to act on his behalf.


1019
1:20:32,975 --> 1:20:37,179
It's hard to believe a beautiful lady
succeeds where many men failed.


1020
1:20:37,179 --> 1:20:39,248
We should invite you
onto the board.


1021
1:20:39,248 --> 1:20:42,417
Thank you, Lord Bostwick.
But I don't think it is suitable


1022
1:20:42,417 --> 1:20:45,954
for an Italian lady to
practice murder professionally.


1023
1:20:45,954 --> 1:20:49,691
I will be content with the reward
you have so kindly offered.


1024
1:20:49,691 --> 1:20:52,461
And you shall have it, dear lady.


1025
1:20:52,461 --> 1:20:54,53
So there he lies.


1026
1:20:54,53 --> 1:20:56,31
Poor lvan.


1027
1:20:56,31 --> 1:20:59,468
He was too young to see
the potentialities of his inheritance.


1028
1:20:59,468 --> 1:21:1,36
Requiescat in pace.


1029
1:21:1,36 --> 1:21:4,54
Ivan killed by a woman, that's droll.


1030
1:21:4,54 --> 1:21:7,709
I believe Spado's house
is quite beautiful.


1031
1:21:7,709 --> 1:21:11,346
As with so many things,
first impressions are the worst.


1032
1:21:11,346 --> 1:21:14,95
This way, signorina.


1033
1:21:14,95 --> 1:21:16,985
And so you see,
my dear signora,


1034
1:21:16,985 --> 1:21:22,391
this young lady has served
her purpose and must be disposed of.


1035
1:21:22,391 --> 1:21:25,794
Miss Winter, Muntzov has been
monopolizing you.


1036
1:21:25,794 --> 1:21:27,996
Signora Spado, this is Miss Winter,


1037
1:21:27,996 --> 1:21:34,403
whose commission you executed
on behalf of your husband.


1038
1:21:34,403 --> 1:21:38,4
If you'll excuse me, I'll make a room
ready for the discussion.


1039
1:21:38,4 --> 1:21:40,409
No, no, no.
This will do splendidly.


1040
1:21:40,409 --> 1:21:44,12
The presence of our ex-chairman
will be a spur to our deliberations.


1041
1:21:44,12 --> 1:21:46,815
You openly admit you are a member
of the Bureau?


1042
1:21:46,815 --> 1:21:48,25
A member?


1043
1:21:48,25 --> 1:21:51,22
Thanks to you and Signora Spado,
I am now the chairman.


1044
1:21:51,22 --> 1:21:53,355
What a journalist
you would have made.


1045
1:21:53,355 --> 1:21:56,491
In at the death of the old Bureau
and the birth of the new.


1046
1:21:56,491 --> 1:22:7,169
Unfortunately, you must also be
its first victim.


1047
1:22:7,169 --> 1:22:10,372
Dispose of her, Muntzov.
It's time you did something useful.


1048
1:22:10,372 --> 1:22:18,647
This way.


1049
1:22:18,647 --> 1:22:21,49
Take her below.
There are steps to the canal.


1050
1:22:21,49 --> 1:22:37,666
Don't make any false moves.
I'm a dangerous man.


1051
1:22:37,666 --> 1:22:45,707
Go to that wall, please,
Miss Winter.


1052
1:22:45,707 --> 1:22:48,377
If you would please face
the wall, my dear.


1053
1:22:48,377 --> 1:22:50,912
We Slavs are so temperamental.


1054
1:22:50,912 --> 1:22:54,383
Somehow, I don't feel like it
at all today.


1055
1:22:54,383 --> 1:22:57,152
So you're a coward as well
as a murderer.


1056
1:22:57,152 --> 1:23:1,323
I don't seem really to care
for killing people anymore.


1057
1:23:1,323 --> 1:23:4,793
Keep quite still, Miss Winter.


1058
1:23:4,793 --> 1:23:44,733
It's best to make a clean job of it.


1059
1:23:44,733 --> 1:23:49,338
Ivan.


1060
1:23:49,338 --> 1:23:51,573
What on earth?


1061
1:23:51,573 --> 1:23:55,11
- I'm in mourning.
- For your lost principles, I presume?


1062
1:23:55,11 --> 1:23:57,879
You look like you're got up
to seduce an archbishop.


1063
1:23:57,879 --> 1:24:1,65
- Don't you like it?
- Oh, I'm turning in my grave.


1064
1:24:1,65 --> 1:24:6,221
Will you at least get rid
of that preposterous hat.


1065
1:24:6,221 --> 1:24:9,891
- How dare you!
- That's better.


1066
1:24:9,891 --> 1:24:12,327
At any rate, you played
your part admirably.


1067
1:24:12,327 --> 1:24:14,963
See what results the report
of my death produced.


1068
1:24:14,963 --> 1:24:18,2
- It nearly produced mine.
- It's brought them here,


1069
1:24:18,2 --> 1:24:19,768
as I knew it would.


1070
1:24:19,768 --> 1:24:22,704
Now we see whether
I can learn more dead than alive.


1071
1:24:22,704 --> 1:24:25,307
But the coffin in the room upstairs,
who's in it?


1072
1:24:25,307 --> 1:24:28,61
The man you identified as me,
of course, her gondolier.


1073
1:24:28,61 --> 1:24:30,946
- Muntzov!
- Come on.


1074
1:24:30,946 --> 1:24:32,414
Muntzov, where are you?


1075
1:24:32,414 --> 1:24:34,95
- Where could that idiot go?
- He'd be here.


1076
1:24:34,95 --> 1:24:38,286
The secret stairs from my apartments
lead down to that landing.


1077
1:24:38,286 --> 1:24:41,923
A girl, even Muntzov
couldn't fail.


1078
1:24:41,923 --> 1:24:44,326
He evidently did.


1079
1:24:44,326 --> 1:24:46,661
And the girl's hat.


1080
1:24:46,661 --> 1:24:53,969
- If he killed her, then...
- Then who killed him?


1081
1:24:53,969 --> 1:24:57,272
- I want to see inside that coffin.
- Oh, no.


1082
1:24:57,272 --> 1:25:11,686
- And why not, signora?
- You're not squeamish, surely?


1083
1:25:11,686 --> 1:25:13,655
Take off the lid.


1084
1:25:13,655 --> 1:25:34,9
- Please, don't disturb the dead.
- Be silent.


1085
1:25:34,9 --> 1:25:41,183
Replace the lid.


1086
1:25:41,183 --> 1:25:44,686
My apologies, signora.
You've done your job well.


1087
1:25:44,686 --> 1:25:50,892
Don't worry, signora.
He can't get away.


1088
1:25:50,892 --> 1:25:54,796
General, I will return to Germany.
Where will your headquarters be?


1089
1:25:54,796 --> 1:25:57,132
At my hunting lodge at Rothenburg.


1090
1:25:57,132 --> 1:26:2,17
The peace conference will take place
across the frontier in the Castle Minsk.


1091
1:26:2,17 --> 1:26:6,41
Convenient. I'll summon the Bureau
members to meet us at Rothenburg.


1092
1:26:6,41 --> 1:26:11,413
- But my staff will be there, officers.
- Of course, and they'll be very useful.


1093
1:26:11,413 --> 1:26:13,648
So goodbye, lvan.


1094
1:26:13,648 --> 1:26:17,85
You're going to miss
our greatest assignment of all.


1095
1:26:17,85 --> 1:26:24,96
At my commission,
the assassination of Europe.


1096
1:26:24,96 --> 1:26:29,297
They have come to take him away.


1097
1:26:29,297 --> 1:27:55,15
Make sure the screws are tight.


1098
1:27:55,15 --> 1:27:59,487
We'll have a glass of wine, and then
we can complete our business.


1099
1:27:59,487 --> 1:28:1,756
Of course, the reward.


1100
1:28:1,756 --> 1:28:4,459
I suppose it was rather tactless
of Cesare


1101
1:28:4,459 --> 1:28:7,128
to tell me so much about
your secret business.


1102
1:28:7,128 --> 1:28:10,465
Who can quarrel with
such an excellent result?


1103
1:28:10,465 --> 1:28:13,401
Surely it is worth more
than a mere 10,000 pounds?


1104
1:28:13,401 --> 1:28:15,537
Of course.
How much would you suggest?


1105
1:28:15,537 --> 1:28:19,7
Naturally, you would not like
your affairs made public.


1106
1:28:19,7 --> 1:28:22,444
Shall we say 100,000?


1107
1:28:22,444 --> 1:28:25,347
Oh, alas, signora,
we are not a rich organization.


1108
1:28:25,347 --> 1:28:29,584
But you have such great plans
now that I have given you control.


1109
1:28:29,584 --> 1:28:32,654
Surely that is worth
special consideration?


1110
1:28:32,654 --> 1:28:34,122
Indeed.


1111
1:28:34,122 --> 1:29:9,624
Von Pinck, see that signora gets the
most special consideration we offer.


1112
1:29:9,624 --> 1:29:23,605
Well done, Miss Winter.
On the spot as usual.


1113
1:29:23,605 --> 1:29:28,109
As Europe's heads of state travel
to Ruthenia for the funeral of its ruler,


1114
1:29:28,109 --> 1:29:33,515
the Archduke Ferdinand's tragic death
threatens to set Europe ablaze.


1115
1:29:33,515 --> 1:29:36,685
Throughout Germany
and the Austro-Hungarian Empire,


1116
1:29:36,685 --> 1:29:41,89
troops of the Grand Alliance are
moving toward the Ruthenian frontier.


1117
1:29:41,89 --> 1:29:45,26
In Russia, Tsar Nicholas assumes
personal command of his forces,


1118
1:29:45,26 --> 1:29:48,797
as his Balkan allies call impatiently
for action.


1119
1:29:48,797 --> 1:29:52,767
In the Republic of France, military
preparations are already afoot.


1120
1:29:52,767 --> 1:30:3,645
Great Britain puts her armed forces
in a state of instant readiness.


1121
1:30:3,645 --> 1:30:8,216
After the funeral, the heads of state
will proceed to the royal castle at Minsk.


1122
1:30:8,216 --> 1:30:11,586
Here, close to the Ruthenian border
with Germany.


1123
1:30:11,586 --> 1:30:15,724
Just across the valley at Rothenburg
is a German army...


1124
1:30:15,724 --> 1:30:18,793
...commanded by
General von Pinck.


1125
1:30:18,793 --> 1:30:21,93
- What do you make of it?
- The kaiser is at the conference.


1126
1:30:21,93 --> 1:30:24,966
- What can the German army do?
- Nothing.


1127
1:30:24,966 --> 1:30:30,672
But what Lord Bostwick does with the
remains of my bureau is the question.


1128
1:30:30,672 --> 1:30:32,307
Mein Gott!


1129
1:30:32,307 --> 1:30:35,944
You might look all right
around the board table, my friends,


1130
1:30:35,944 --> 1:30:39,681
but thank God
I don't have to take you into battle.


1131
1:30:39,681 --> 1:30:49,357
That goes under the jacket, man.


1132
1:30:49,357 --> 1:30:51,292
The Russian anthem.


1133
1:30:51,292 --> 1:30:53,428
The czar is arriving.


1134
1:30:53,428 --> 1:30:56,64
We shall need an anthem
of our own.


1135
1:30:56,64 --> 1:30:58,366
Remind me.


1136
1:30:58,366 --> 1:31:20,54
The czar.


1137
1:31:20,54 --> 1:31:23,458
The others will soon be here.


1138
1:31:23,458 --> 1:31:26,561
The time has come to
make a move, gentlemen.


1139
1:31:26,561 --> 1:31:28,93
Are your officers
safely under lock and key?


1140
1:31:28,93 --> 1:31:31,466
Quite safe and very angry
in their underwear.


1141
1:31:31,466 --> 1:31:35,103
I've sent a limber ahead
with our little toy.


1142
1:31:35,103 --> 1:31:43,912
My engineers will have it loaded
by the time we arrive.


1143
1:31:43,912 --> 1:31:46,648
There it is,
the castle at Minsk.


1144
1:31:46,648 --> 1:31:50,518
All the crowned heads of Europe
under one roof, what an opportunity.


1145
1:31:50,518 --> 1:31:52,2
Now, lvan.


1146
1:31:52,2 --> 1:31:54,689
For his lordship, I mean,
if war is what he wants.


1147
1:31:54,689 --> 1:31:58,126
With your ideas, I'm surprised
you're shocked at war.


1148
1:31:58,126 --> 1:32:1,863
Not at all. It's a matter of business.
How can we charge our prices


1149
1:32:1,863 --> 1:32:5,4
with everybody happily killing
each other for a shilling a day?


1150
1:32:5,4 --> 1:32:30,758
Look out.


1151
1:32:30,758 --> 1:32:32,393
- What is it?
- A bomb.


1152
1:32:32,393 --> 1:32:34,162
It's so big.
What will they do?


1153
1:32:34,162 --> 1:32:35,597
- Drop it.
- What?


1154
1:32:35,597 --> 1:32:38,9
On the castle. Ride there quickly.
It must be evacuated.


1155
1:32:38,9 --> 1:32:51,412
- But the frontier will be guarded.
- Ride, I say. I must follow that bomb.


1156
1:32:51,412 --> 1:34:3,551
French president.


1157
1:34:3,551 --> 1:34:5,219
Vorsicht, vorsicht.


1158
1:34:5,219 --> 1:34:8,623
Corporal? Corporal!


1159
1:34:8,623 --> 1:34:10,858
What are you doing?
What is that thing?


1160
1:34:10,858 --> 1:34:13,261
Some new sort of bomb.
We are to load it.


1161
1:34:13,261 --> 1:34:15,83
Aboard my zeppelin?
What's the devil next?


1162
1:34:15,83 --> 1:34:18,666
- General's orders, sir.
- This is a naval ship.


1163
1:34:18,666 --> 1:34:23,738
We'll soon see about that.


1164
1:34:23,738 --> 1:34:26,507
Come on, come on, get busy, there.


1165
1:34:26,507 --> 1:34:28,476
Los, get this thing unloaded.


1166
1:34:28,476 --> 1:34:31,379
The general gave me
the order himself. Los!


1167
1:34:31,379 --> 1:34:35,216
What the devil are you talking about?
Bombs in zeppelins, ridiculous.


1168
1:34:35,216 --> 1:34:45,893
Weg mit dem Objekt. Es muss
heute nicht getan werden.


1169
1:34:45,893 --> 1:35:2,81
Get up.


1170
1:35:2,81 --> 1:35:6,481
A life on the ocean wave and here
we are in the middle of a forest


1171
1:35:6,481 --> 1:35:9,65
- with a bloody gas bag.
- You men there,


1172
1:35:9,65 --> 1:35:12,86
what are you doing?
Do up your buttons.


1173
1:35:12,86 --> 1:35:13,721
Where is your officer?


1174
1:35:13,721 --> 1:35:16,724
- Your officer, where is he?
- He was here a moment ago.


1175
1:35:16,724 --> 1:35:19,494
Well, he is not here now.
I shall take over command.


1176
1:35:19,494 --> 1:35:21,662
General's orders.
The zeppelin takes off


1177
1:35:21,662 --> 1:35:25,7
and returns to base immediately.
Get that thing away from there.


1178
1:35:25,7 --> 1:35:28,669
Corporal, do you hear me?
Get that thing away from here!


1179
1:35:28,669 --> 1:35:31,339
Jawohl, Herr Kapitan.


1180
1:35:31,339 --> 1:35:32,94
Bloody officers.


1181
1:35:32,94 --> 1:35:36,511
- Who is the pilot?
- The Herr Kapitan, Herr Kapitan.


1182
1:35:36,511 --> 1:35:40,348
- But he is not here.
- Well, I also am a pilot, Herr Kapitan.


1183
1:35:40,348 --> 1:35:46,254
Then why didn't you say so?
Get on with it, man.


1184
1:35:46,254 --> 1:35:49,29
Get that thing down here.


1185
1:35:49,29 --> 1:36:16,384
Careful, careful.


1186
1:36:16,384 --> 1:36:19,954
- Hey, you. Where's the officer?
- Well, there was one here.


1187
1:36:19,954 --> 1:36:22,69
- Where is he now?
- I don't know, Herr General.


1188
1:36:22,69 --> 1:36:25,159
- We've lost one already.
- Don't answer back.


1189
1:36:25,159 --> 1:36:28,429
Prepare to take off immediately.


1190
1:36:28,429 --> 1:36:30,364
What are you doing there, corporal?


1191
1:36:30,364 --> 1:36:52,887
- Get that thing aboard.
- Jawohl, Herr General.


1192
1:36:52,887 --> 1:36:55,49
- Where are you going?
- I must go to the castle.


1193
1:36:55,49 --> 1:36:59,227
You have, have you? The frontier
is closed. No one is allowed through.


1194
1:36:59,227 --> 1:37:2,23
The castle must be evacuated.
They're gonna bomb it.


1195
1:37:2,23 --> 1:37:6,267
Do you think we're idiots in Ruthenia?
Evacuate! They've only just arrived.


1196
1:37:6,267 --> 1:37:8,636
They are going
to drop a bomb, I tell you.


1197
1:37:8,636 --> 1:37:15,877
Oh, drop it?
Who is going to? An eagle?


1198
1:37:15,877 --> 1:37:17,812
Through you go.


1199
1:37:17,812 --> 1:37:23,651
There are no frontiers
for the Sisters of Mercy.


1200
1:37:23,651 --> 1:37:25,686
Will you please listen to me?


1201
1:37:25,686 --> 1:37:36,597
Get out of here,
before I have you arrested.


1202
1:37:36,597 --> 1:37:38,9
Heave ho.


1203
1:37:38,9 --> 1:37:41,369
Heave.


1204
1:37:41,369 --> 1:37:43,905
Heave.


1205
1:37:43,905 --> 1:37:46,807
Heave ho.


1206
1:37:46,807 --> 1:37:50,645
Steady. Good.


1207
1:37:50,645 --> 1:37:52,413
Up.


1208
1:37:52,413 --> 1:37:55,55
- Up. Up.
- Careful.


1209
1:37:55,55 --> 1:37:58,719
Up. Up.


1210
1:37:58,719 --> 1:38:3,124
Halt.


1211
1:38:3,124 --> 1:38:11,966
The bomb is secured.


1212
1:38:11,966 --> 1:38:28,983
Stand by to cast off.


1213
1:38:28,983 --> 1:38:33,955
Release ballast.


1214
1:38:33,955 --> 1:38:37,191
Cast off of it.


1215
1:38:37,191 --> 1:38:48,769
Cast off now.


1216
1:38:48,769 --> 1:38:51,973
- Set course for Minsk.
- Minsk, Herr General?


1217
1:38:51,973 --> 1:39:14,595
Drive and ask no questions.


1218
1:39:14,595 --> 1:39:18,266
Bombs from the air.
What a marvelous idea.


1219
1:39:18,266 --> 1:39:28,75
All those little houses down there, just
pull a lever and poof! They're gone.


1220
1:39:28,75 --> 1:39:45,59
My God, let's go and see.


1221
1:39:45,59 --> 1:39:58,606
Dragomiloff!


1222
1:39:58,606 --> 1:40:2,743
Revolutionary idea, general,
an aerial bomb.


1223
1:40:2,743 --> 1:40:10,51
History in the making.
A frightening concept.


1224
1:40:10,51 --> 1:40:42,49
In 15 minutes,
we should be over the castle.


1225
1:40:42,49 --> 1:40:57,31
What's that fool up to?


1226
1:40:57,31 --> 1:41:51,318
- What the devil are you doing there?
- There's a naval officer onboard.


1227
1:41:51,318 --> 1:41:55,956
Get it back on course.


1228
1:41:55,956 --> 1:41:58,559
The captain. He must
have hidden on board.


1229
1:41:58,559 --> 1:42:5,166
- Well, why didn't you search?
- He'll give no more trouble.


1230
1:42:5,166 --> 1:42:7,334
- We're back on course.
- Not too soon.


1231
1:42:7,334 --> 1:42:16,844
We're approaching the frontier.


1232
1:42:16,844 --> 1:42:19,346
Look! Look!


1233
1:42:19,346 --> 1:42:21,382
So, what is this?


1234
1:42:21,382 --> 1:42:26,554
It is un ballon.


1235
1:42:26,554 --> 1:42:32,226
By Jove! It looks like
some sort of airship.


1236
1:42:32,226 --> 1:42:34,762
Nothing is supposed
to cross the frontier.


1237
1:42:34,762 --> 1:42:37,598
It's one of those damned zeppelins.
Where's that Hun?


1238
1:42:37,598 --> 1:42:40,601
- Good morning.
- There you are, Herr Oberleutnant.


1239
1:42:40,601 --> 1:42:42,369
General von Pinck has sent word.


1240
1:42:42,369 --> 1:42:46,106
- It's a patrol for security purposes.
- Why was I not informed?


1241
1:42:46,106 --> 1:42:49,477
- Prussians do what they like.
- They're invading our frontier.


1242
1:42:49,477 --> 1:42:51,779
Now, then. Now, then.
Steady the butts.


1243
1:42:51,779 --> 1:43:3,958
This is supposed to be
a peace conference.


1244
1:43:3,958 --> 1:43:12,766
- Starboard two points.
- Gentlemen.


1245
1:43:12,766 --> 1:43:14,969
Dragomiloff.


1246
1:43:14,969 --> 1:43:18,38
- It's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible, general.


1247
1:43:18,38 --> 1:43:21,408
- This time we'll make quite sure.
- Unwise, my lord.


1248
1:43:21,408 --> 1:43:27,181
You see, a bullet through a hydrogen
balloon will blow us all out of the sky.


1249
1:43:27,181 --> 1:43:29,617
It's true, my lord.
Leave him to me.


1250
1:43:29,617 --> 1:43:32,553
He will not stand a chance.


1251
1:43:32,553 --> 1:43:42,496
I was the saber champion
of all Germany.


1252
1:43:42,496 --> 1:43:59,446
En garde.


1253
1:43:59,446 --> 1:44:3,25
Now, here! And here!


1254
1:44:3,25 --> 1:44:5,386
Come on.


1255
1:44:5,386 --> 1:44:7,221
Very good.


1256
1:44:7,221 --> 1:44:17,298
Take this.


1257
1:44:17,298 --> 1:44:49,496
Here, here, here.


1258
1:44:49,496 --> 1:44:57,905
- Get him.
- This way. After him.


1259
1:44:57,905 --> 1:45:1,542
Keep her steady.


1260
1:45:1,542 --> 1:45:5,679
Don't do it, Charles. Indiscriminate
destruction will engulf you too.


1261
1:45:5,679 --> 1:45:8,349
One death or a million,
where's the difference?


1262
1:45:8,349 --> 1:45:11,852
We're surgeons, not butchers.
We only kill to destroy evil.


1263
1:45:11,852 --> 1:45:15,99
- Hypocrite. You kill for money.
- Only those who deserve to die.


1264
1:45:15,99 --> 1:45:19,526
- We must judge before we kill.
- Judge? Young fool.


1265
1:45:19,526 --> 1:45:22,496
You're not an assassin,
you're a critic.


1266
1:45:22,496 --> 1:45:25,65
Steady.


1267
1:45:25,65 --> 1:46:1,201
Steady.


1268
1:46:1,201 --> 1:47:48,108
It's jammed.


1269
1:47:48,108 --> 1:47:52,112
Damn you, get out of my way.


1270
1:47:52,112 --> 1:47:58,485
Rise, Sir lvan.


1271
1:47:58,485 --> 1:48:3,49
Your Majesties, you must evacuate
the castle immediately.


1272
1:48:3,49 --> 1:48:6,827
Miss Winter, not quite
on the spot for once.


1273
1:48:6,827 --> 1:48:11,198
- Ivan, what happened?
- Sir lvan, if you please.


1274
1:48:11,198 --> 1:48:13,867
Virtue has been rewarded.


1275
1:48:13,867 --> 1:50:13,867
Well, really.
