###4 NARRATOR: Welcome to Fashion Week International, the show
###8 that reports on the most fabulous fashion weeks in the
###11 world, and the culture and politics behind them.
###14 First up, we head to Rio de Janeiro.
###16 
###20 [BOSSA NOVA]
###28 NARRATOR: 30 years ago, the Rio de Janeiro tourist board
###31 decided that the best person to tell the story of their
###34 city was Arnold Schwarzenegger.
###38 He was enchanted by Rio, and by one element of it in
###41 particular.
###42 ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: I can absolutely understand why
###44 Brazil is totally devoted to my favorite
###47 body part, the ass.
###50 NARRATOR: 30 years on, we felt it was time to update Arnie's
###53 razor sharp observations.
###56 But perhaps some things never change.
###59 [HIP HOP MUSIC]
###66 NARRATOR: Brazil is booming.
###68 This year, it was named the sixth biggest economy in the
###71 world, overtaking the UK, and shows no signs of stopping as
###76 it gears up to host the 2014 World Cup
###79 and the 2016 Olympics.
###82 Like Arnie said, Rio is the city that seems to have it
###85 all, boasting one of the most idyllic urban landscapes in
###88 the world, from the famous the beaches to the infamous
###91 favelas, and a population that really pays testimony to the
###95 fact that mixing the gene pools of the world is
###98 a pretty good idea.
###100 [TECHNO MUSIC]
###104 
###109 NARRATOR: We were here, of course, for Rio Fashion Week,
###112 which was being held at one Rio's biggest landmarks, a
###115 horse racecourse in the middle of the city.
###118 Being one of the more established events we've been
###121 to this series, we knew the official Fashion Week would be
###124 more of the same.
###125 But we wanted to learn about a transgender phenomenon on the
###128 runways, a race debate dividing the industry, and see
###132 for ourselves how big butts and skinny models play
###135 alongside each other.
###138 In the last few years, the Brazilian fashion industry has
###141 been leading the way in the use of transgender models on
###144 the catwalk.
###145 The world's only high profile transsexual
###148 supermodel hails from Rio.
###151 Lea T hit the headlines last year when she was featured in
###154 "Elle Brazil," photographed kissing Kate Moss for the
###158 cover of high end fashion magazine, Love.
###161 And Brazilian bikini history was rewritten when she was
###164 shot by Terry Richardson for the Blue Man campaign.
###168 In fact, Brazil's first ever known transsexual model was
###172 working in Rio long before that.
###174 Roberta Close came onto the scene you in the 80s, and had
###177 everybody fooled, including--
###180 if you believe her autobiography--
###182 Eddie Murphy, George Clooney, and Robert deNiro.
###185 
###188 Antonio Bizarro was one of the designers using transsexual
###191 models among the other girls to showcase his collection at
###194 the fashion week.
###196 Personally, I'm just really excited [INAUDIBLE]
###199 choice in models.
###201 
###228 ANTONIO BIZARRO: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###229 
###266 NARRATOR: He said we have to guess which one was a
###270 transsexual.
###270 And that's obviously a really sensitive issue.
###272 I don't just want to go up to some girl and be like, can I
###275 see your dick?
###276 Which is, unfortunately, pretty much
###279 what I ended up doing.
###281 The worst thing just happened.
###282 I was sure that this girl was a transsexual, just a really,
###286 the most convincing feminine one.
###289 So I just stormed right up there and was like, excuse me,
###293 is your name Camilla.
###294 And she was like, no.
###295 And everybody kind of jumped in and went no, this is Linda.
###298 I think that they all know that Camilla is the
###301 transsexual, and it was just like a massive faux pas.
###304 And now that girl thinks that I think she's a man.
###306 
###311 Just as I wished the ground would swallow me up, Carol
###314 Marra, the other transsexual model was pointed out to me.
###318 You look very beautiful.
###320 I'm Charlotte.
###321 Nice to meet you.
###323 So, Antonio's show, he told me, is based around India's
###327 third gender, which we all know about.
###330 For you, is being you being a third gender?
###334 Or for you are you a woman?
###335 CAROL MARRA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###337 
###363 NARRATOR: I can't wait to see you on the catwalk.
###366 It's really good to speak to you.
###367 Thank you.
###368 Have fun.
###370 Carol is an inspiring example in the transgender
###373 community of Rio.
###375 However, transgenderism is still a subject all too often
###378 oppressed by taboo.
###380 Carol had spoken about another reality for many other
###383 transgenders, the sex industry.
###386 As these girls aren't exactly listed in the phone book, I
###390 found myself having to do something
###392 I've never done before.
###395 So we're currently cruising around in the bang bus.
###398 We're cruising around Rio, trying to pick up some
###401 transgender prostitutes.
###403 And the truth is there's still some things I'm kind of
###405 itching to find out, such as how do they hide their penis.
###411 I've never knowingly approached a prostitute for
###414 sex or for an interview.
###418 My heart's pounding.
###420 Bye.
###421 
###425 We're looking for transgenders.
###427 Because they're obviously not, I can tell from looking now.
###430 I can tell from now they're women.
###433 Yes.
###433 So let's ask them if they know any.
###435 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###436 
###445 NARRATOR: Oh, I swear.
###447 I think it was a man.
###449 I think the one in the little shorts had a penis.
###452 My interpreter and I felt like maybe something had got lost
###455 in translation.
###456 Because I was sure these were girls who were boys.
###459 So we went back out to clarify.
###461 
###464 In no time at all, I had gone from complete confusion to
###468 learning they were in fact pre-op transsexuals.
###472 Hola.
###473 
###477 NAYARA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###479 
###520 NARRATOR: Nayara had to get back to work, but there was
###522 still so much more I wanted to know.
###525 To my surprise, she asked if we wanted to
###527 meet up with her again.
###529 She said she wanted to show us more about her life.
###532 But just how much more, I had no idea.
###535 [CHURCH CHOIR]
###545 NARRATOR: From the red light district, we headed straight
###548 to the Santo Antonio Church to meet an unlikely crusader in
###552 another controversial catwalk story, Friar David Santos.
###558 DAVID SANTOS: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###559 
###589 NARRATOR: In recent years, a race row has hit the Brazilian
###592 fashion industry over the limited use of black models on
###595 Brazilian catwalks.
###597 Earlier in the day, the Franciscan friar had led a
###600 protest outside the fashion week.
###603 Together with his group Educafros, he's been
###605 campaigning against institutional racial bias
###608 across all aspects of Brazilian
###610 society, including fashion.
###613 Brazil is over 50% black, the largest black
###617 population after Nigeria.
###619 In 2010, thanks to Friar David's protests at Sao Paolo
###623 fashion week, a government quota was introduced, stating
###626 that there were to be no less than 10% black
###629 models on the catwalk.
###631 The following year, this was repealed, deemed
###634 unconstitutional.
###636 DAVID SANTOS: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###637 
###664 [SINGING HYMNS IN PORTUGUESE]
###678 DAVID SANTOS: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###679 
###699 NARRATOR: Backstage at the fashion week, the mood was a
###701 little less somber than that at the church.
###704 And none of these girls looked like they were about to take
###706 communion any time soon.
###707 
###710 On the catwalk, there were definitely fewer black models.
###713 But in fact, there was not a lot of any one kind of model--
###717 apart from skinny, of course.
###719 To suggest an entire industry is racist might be pushing it.
###724 When you look at what an incredible mix of races makes
###726 this country, it actually becomes a question of what
###730 does define Brazilian beauty.
###733 We went to meet Sergio Mattos, one of the old guard of
###737 Brazilian fashion, and the man who helped
###739 launch Giselle's career.
###741 NARRATOR: Thank you for letting us be here.
###742 I am very distracted by all these ugly
###745 people on the walls.
###747 So do you want to show me, maybe, some of the big names
###750 you discovered.
###751 
###789 
###814 NARRATOR: So I mean, obviously, when we were at the
###816 Fashion Week, there were these people protesting that there
###819 aren't enough black people in the fashion industry.
###822 Is the fashion industry racist?
###824 Or is it that clients don't want the black models?
###828 
###868 NARRATOR: Only 15!
###870 Oh my god, I can't look.
###871 
###874 [MUSIC IN PORTUGUESE]
###880 NARRATOR: From the favelas of Rocinha to City of God, other
###884 slightly less high profile modeling schools are catering
###887 to those who don't want to wait to be discovered.
###890 [MUSIC IN PORTUGUESE]
###892 
###908 NARRATOR: Dream Models is one such school at the heart of
###911 Rocinha, a notorious favela with a dramatic presence in
###915 Rio's urban landscape.
###916 Wow.
###917 This is absolutely breathtaking.
###919 Look.
###921 ZE LUIZ: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###922 NARRATOR: It's incredible.
###924 Yeah.
###926 ZE LUIZ: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###928 
###1043 [SINGING IN PORTUGUESE]
###1044 
###1097 [MUSIC IN PORTUGUESE]
###1102 NARRATOR: For tourists, Rio comes with the postcard
###1105 promise of the iconic thong-clad
###1107 bountiful beach bottom.
###1110 Sadly, this shape had been somewhat
###1112 scarce on the catwalks.
###1113 So we've gone out for a bit of good old
###1115 fashioned bottom hunting.
###1117 We've come to this gym in Rio because I'm going to take part
###1120 in a special sort of dance class, which, it seems that
###1124 all girls here seem to know how to do instinctively.
###1128 It's something that's done in all the [INAUDIBLE]
###1131 clubs.
###1132 And the girls who are going to be teaching me to dance are
###1134 actually one of the biggest funkera girl groups.
###1138 And their name is, direct
###1140 conversation, Cage of Hot Girls.
###1142 
###1150 Cage of Hot Girls are an all girl funkera group.
###1154 Female purveyors of Brazilian funk music, a hard-hitting
###1158 genre born in Rio's favelas in the '90s.
###1161 The female bottom has long had symbolic importance in
###1164 Brazilian culture.
###1166 And today this is nowhere more apparent
###1168 than in the funk scene.
###1170 At street level, funk has been a huge influence on Brazilian
###1173 girls in terms of self-expression and
###1175 aesthetic--
###1176 from the way dance to the clothes that
###1178 compliment their curves.
###1179 
###1183 It would seem that every Brazilian girl knows
###1185 inherently how to perform the magical bum dance, and can't
###1189 wait to show you, whether on YouTube dancing for her
###1193 boyfriend, with her dog, or in any nightclub across Rio.
###1198 Today, I was going to be shown the ropes.
###1201 I'd been invited to crash Cage of Hot Girls rehearsal session
###1204 and try to keep up.
###1206 However, I had a feeling this was something that
###1209 could not be taught.
###1211 Their bodies are completely different to mine.
###1213 They couldn't be any more different.
###1215 The outfits just make their body shape pop even more than
###1221 it does without bright colors glued to it.
###1224 [BRAZILIAN FUNK]
###1232 NARRATOR: When I came to Brazil, this is what I was
###1234 hoping to see-- colors and curves, and attitude.
###1237 We spent a lot of our time here at the fashion week,
###1240 where I've seen a lot more influence of European and
###1244 international beauty standards.
###1246 And the girls are very thin.
###1249 What, for you, does Brazilian beauty mean?
###1253 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1255 
###1258 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1260 
###1277 NARRATOR: Where did this trend for dancing
###1279 like this come from?
###1281 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1282 
###1308 NARRATOR: Your bottom just moves when you walk.
###1311 Mine doesn't even move when I walk.
###1313 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1315 
###1319 NARRATOR: OK so I'll stay here until it happens.
###1321 
###1326 Ten.
###1328 It hurts a bit.
###1331 Is it moving?
###1332 
###1336 Is it doing it?
###1337 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1338 
###1345 NARRATOR: It's too small.
###1347 
###1353 Ta da.
###1354 How long do I have to do the exercises before my bum and my
###1357 thighs look like yours?
###1358 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1360 
###1392 NARRATOR: Injections and implants aside, I guess these
###1395 girls really do echo a widespread ideal
###1397 of Brazilian beauty.
###1399 And the crowds that gathered around their post-rehearsal
###1402 shopping spree confirmed this to me.
###1404 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1406 
###1409 NARRATOR: Rio Fashion Week understandably strives for a
###1412 more Eurocentric perspective, afraid to break away from the
###1415 skinny mold guaranteed to sell clothes.
###1418 But I was pleased I'd come to Brazil, met Cage of Hot Girls,
###1422 and not just come away with an impression of
###1424 flaccid model bottoms.
###1426 
###1434 We were going back to meet Carol, the transsexual model
###1436 from the fashion week, to hang out during a swimwear shoot
###1439 taking place on the roof of her Ipanema apartment.
###1443 Carol might still be pre-op, but nevertheless finds lots of
###1447 the jobs she gets require little to be left to the
###1449 imagination, such as swimwear.
###1453 CAROL MARRA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1454 
###1486 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1490 NARRATOR: Can you tell me when you decided to make the
###1494 changes to become a woman fully?
###1496 CAROL MARRA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1497 
###1549 NARRATOR: Is it important for you to be able to help and
###1551 inspire other people who want to become transsexuals?
###1556 NARRATOR: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1557 
###1604 NARRATOR: As far as guys on the street are concerned,
###1606 Carol is a female model.
###1608 And although her success may be partly down to being a
###1611 transsexual, as is often the case in fashion, what is
###1615 thought to be unusual soon becomes the norm.
###1619 Oh my god.
###1620 
###1626 They all stop for you.
###1628 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1629 
###1669 [MUSIC IN PORTUGUESE]
###1674 NARRATOR: With Fashion Week over, we had one
###1676 last night in Rio.
###1678 And despite a host of after parties to attend, I decided
###1681 to take up a different offer, from Nayara, the transsexual
###1685 prostitute as she prepared herself for a night's work.
###1689 Marginalized not only by her gender, but also her economic
###1692 background, Nayara had come to represent everything we'd
###1695 learned from the Fashion Week since we arrived.
###1697 
###1702 You look super cute today.
###1703 I love your dress.
###1704 You look different when you're in your daytime wear.
###1707 Tell me about this dress.
###1708 Was it a football shirt?
###1710 NAYARA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1711 
###1724 NARRATOR: Nayara ran us through her outfit choices,
###1727 and explained what's needed to hide her manhood.
###1732 If I was your customer, I think I'd be a bit naive.
###1735 I wouldn't know what was going on under there.
###1737 How do you disguise it so well?
###1739 NAYARA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1741 
###1761 NARRATOR: We went back into the red light district, where
###1764 we'd first met, to one of the many sex hotels in Rio.
###1768 NAYARA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1769 
###1775 [WOLF WHISTLE]
###1781 NARRATOR: No one is supposed to set foot inside these
###1783 places, unless they're getting a leg over.
###1785 
###1795 We're in a sex hotel in Rio, with Nayara and Daniela, our
###1800 two new sex worker friends.
###1802 Daniela is Nayara's best friend.
###1805 They work as a team.
###1808 DANIELA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1809 
###1832 NAYARA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1833 
###1859 DANIELA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1861 
###1884 NARRATOR: What's this?
###1885 
###1889 DANIELA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1890 
###1923 NARRATOR: Who is this?
###1924 DANIELA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1926 NARRATOR: Amazing.
###1927 Not only was Daniela a mother of someone else's three kids,
###1930 but also father to one of her own.
###1932 DANIELA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1934 
###1957 NARRATOR: After everything they told me, I wondered if
###1960 the genital sex change operation was the best life
###1963 choice for them after all.
###1966 So when do you hope to be able to afford the
###1968 final sex change operation?
###1972 DANIELA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]

###1982 NAYARA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]

###2022 [MUSIC IN PORTUGUESE]
###2024 
###2039 NARRATOR: As the girls strutted off into the night to
###2041 make a days of it, nightclubs across Rio heaved with the
###2045 funk-fueled passion of boys and girls magical bum dancing
###2049 the night away.
###2052 As day breaks, the beach once more becomes the democratizing
###2056 leveler of Rio's society where, as is the case with
###2060 many of our friends we met this week, wearing fewer
###2063 clothes brings people from all walks of life together.
###2067 Our week with transgender models, prostitutes, and
###2070 turbulent priests had shown us that Rio is a place with a
###2074 unique capacity for embracing fashion at the margins.
###2079 The thriving economy and fast-approaching global
###2082 sporting events are bound to change the face of Rio in
###2085 coming years.
###2086 But there are some things which clearly
###2088 aren't going anywhere.
