1
0:0:4,228 --> 0:0:7,579
- Hey mom.
- Hey Lindsey.


2
0:0:7,579 --> 0:0:11,98
Mom, do you know any stories of any
interesting relatives in your family?


3
0:0:11,98 --> 0:0:13,667
- Uh, let's see...


4
0:0:13,667 --> 0:0:15,2
Oh, there was cousin Isaac.


5
0:0:15,2 --> 0:0:16,203
We called him Izzy.


6
0:0:16,203 --> 0:0:17,704
- Oh, really? What's his story?


7
0:0:17,704 --> 0:0:19,106
- That was it.


8
0:0:19,106 --> 0:0:20,807
His name was Isaac,
and we called him Izzy.


9
0:0:20,807 --> 0:0:22,976
- He did do
something important once,


10
0:0:22,976 --> 0:0:24,678
but nobody would tell me
what it was,


11
0:0:24,678 --> 0:0:25,712
and he went to jail.


12
0:0:25,712 --> 0:0:27,47
- Hey, you know,


13
0:0:27,47 --> 0:0:28,415
I know this story about a boy


14
0:0:28,415 --> 0:0:30,717
who had a sister
who was half girl, half dog.


15
0:0:30,717 --> 0:0:32,252
- And I know a story
about a girl


16
0:0:32,252 --> 0:0:33,72
who punched her brother
in the face


17
0:0:33,72 --> 0:0:34,888
and gave him two swollen eyes.


18
0:0:34,888 --> 0:0:36,823
- Okay, enough.


19
0:0:36,823 --> 0:0:37,958
What is this for anyway?


20
0:0:37,958 --> 0:0:39,92
- I have to write about


21
0:0:39,92 --> 0:0:40,928
an interesting relative
for my English class.


22
0:0:40,928 --> 0:0:42,329
- Oh. Well, your father
has a bunch


23
0:0:42,329 --> 0:0:43,463
of old family photo albums.


24
0:0:43,463 --> 0:0:45,98
Maybe you can find
somebody interesting


25
0:0:45,98 --> 0:0:46,266
on his side of the family.


26
0:0:46,266 --> 0:0:47,668
- Wow.
That's a really good idea.


27
0:0:47,668 --> 0:0:48,669
Thanks.


28
0:0:48,669 --> 0:0:50,137
- Hey, you know,
if that doesn't work,


29
0:0:50,137 --> 0:0:51,738
I know another story
about this kid...


30
0:0:51,738 --> 0:0:54,208
- Say another word,
and I will spit in your ear.


31
0:0:54,208 --> 0:0:57,578
By the time mom gets over here,
it'll be too late.


32
0:0:57,578 --> 0:0:59,379
Thanks, mom.


33
0:0:59,379 --> 0:1:8,789
- Oh, you're welcome.

35
0:1:12,559 --> 0:1:14,828
- Hey, thanks for coming over
and doing my blog for me, Ray.


36
0:1:14,828 --> 0:1:16,93
- Hey, man, I just want
to get as much attention


37
0:1:16,93 --> 0:1:18,699
for my charity
as I possibly can.


38
0:1:18,699 --> 0:1:21,34
We got this real big event
coming up:


39
0:1:21,34 --> 0:1:24,204
music, comedy,
a celebrity basketball game,


40
0:1:24,204 --> 0:1:27,4
a fashion show,
and a pancake breakfast.


41
0:1:27,4 --> 0:1:28,342
- Throw in Tom joyner,


42
0:1:28,342 --> 0:1:32,446
and you could put all that
on a cruise.


43
0:1:32,446 --> 0:1:35,682
- Yes, it's for the kids.


44
0:1:35,682 --> 0:1:37,451
But I'm telling you,
I'm having the hardest time


45
0:1:37,451 --> 0:1:39,419
pulling it all together, man.
Seriously.


46
0:1:39,419 --> 0:1:42,89
- You know what,
you should talk to my wife.


47
0:1:42,89 --> 0:1:44,157
She plans stuff like this
all the time.


48
0:1:44,157 --> 0:1:46,36
- Hello.
- And there she is.


49
0:1:46,36 --> 0:1:47,761
- Here I am.


50
0:1:47,761 --> 0:1:49,796
- Suzanne, this is star
first baseman Ray savage.


51
0:1:49,796 --> 0:1:51,465
Ray, this my wife, Suzanne.


52
0:1:51,465 --> 0:1:53,333
- Hi.
- Oh, it's nice to meet you.


53
0:1:53,333 --> 0:1:56,837
All right, now, is that Suzanne
with a "z" or an "s"?


54
0:1:56,837 --> 0:1:58,71
- Ah, a "z."


55
0:1:58,71 --> 0:2:0,107
- Mmm. I like the "z"s.


56
0:2:0,107 --> 0:2:3,477
You're a lucky man, Nick.
Lucky man.


57
0:2:3,477 --> 0:2:4,711
- You know, I know you.


58
0:2:4,711 --> 0:2:7,214
I've seen you in those
commercials with the kids.


59
0:2:7,214 --> 0:2:8,482
Yeah, that's kind of my thing.


60
0:2:8,482 --> 0:2:10,817
You know, George Clooney is
for helping out Africa.


61
0:2:10,817 --> 0:2:12,452
Sting is for saving
the rain forests.


62
0:2:12,452 --> 0:2:15,122
And Sean penn, you know, he's
for helping out them Haitians.


63
0:2:15,122 --> 0:2:19,159
Me? I'm for the kids.


64
0:2:19,159 --> 0:2:21,628
- Hey, babe, are we still going
to the movie on Wednesday night?


65
0:2:21,628 --> 0:2:22,996
- Oh, yeah. We're good.


66
0:2:22,996 --> 0:2:24,865
- Okay, 'cause I was just
looking at the review.


67
0:2:24,865 --> 0:2:26,33
Four stars.


68
0:2:26,33 --> 0:2:27,267
- I can't wait.
- All right, bye.


69
0:2:27,267 --> 0:2:28,702
- Oh, whoa. Wait, wait.


70
0:2:28,702 --> 0:2:31,505
Ray is putting together
this huge charity event,


71
0:2:31,505 --> 0:2:33,373
and, uh, it sounds like
he could use your help.


72
0:2:33,373 --> 0:2:34,608
- Oh, okay.


73
0:2:34,608 --> 0:2:36,376
Well, I will get
your information from Nick,


74
0:2:36,376 --> 0:2:38,278
and I'll have my assistant,
Gigi, give you call


75
0:2:38,278 --> 0:2:40,881
and schedule something
and discuss consultation fees.


76
0:2:40,881 --> 0:2:42,115
- Fees?


77
0:2:42,115 --> 0:2:43,183
- Yeah.


78
0:2:43,183 --> 0:2:46,86
I do it for money,
not for the kids.


79
0:2:46,86 --> 0:2:49,99
- Ha.


80
0:2:49,99 --> 0:2:52,926
- Oh, and this is my mother
with granny "V"


81
0:2:52,926 --> 0:2:54,828
at a negro league baseball game.


82
0:2:54,828 --> 0:2:57,898
One of her boyfriends played
for the San Francisco sea lions.


83
0:2:57,898 --> 0:2:59,299
- What's that in her hand?


84
0:2:59,299 --> 0:3:1,535
- Oh, that's an early version
of the number one finger.


85
0:3:1,535 --> 0:3:3,203
It was made entirely of wood.


86
0:3:3,203 --> 0:3:4,438
- Wood?


87
0:3:4,438 --> 0:3:6,74
- Yeah, styrofoam was
too expensive back then.


88
0:3:6,74 --> 0:3:8,141
You know, a lot of people say


89
0:3:8,141 --> 0:3:9,776
granny "V" was ahead
of her time.


90
0:3:9,776 --> 0:3:10,911
- Why do they say that?


91
0:3:10,911 --> 0:3:13,88
- Have you ever heard
of madam C.J. Walker?


92
0:3:13,88 --> 0:3:15,215
- No. Who's she?


93
0:3:15,215 --> 0:3:17,784
- Well, she was the first
woman millionaire.


94
0:3:17,784 --> 0:3:20,53
- Wow, she was like
the first Oprah.


95
0:3:20,53 --> 0:3:21,722
- Yeah.
- Was granny "V" her partner?


96
0:3:21,722 --> 0:3:23,156
- Oh, no, no.


97
0:3:23,156 --> 0:3:26,193
Granny "V" was the first woman
to borrow $20,000 from her.


98
0:3:26,193 --> 0:3:29,863
She was more like
the first Gayle.


99
0:3:29,863 --> 0:3:31,531
- Anyway, she had
this great idea for a shop


100
0:3:31,531 --> 0:3:33,4
where people could get
eyeglasses in an hr.


101
0:3:33,4 --> 0:3:35,769
Now, at the time,
nobody thought it would work.


102
0:3:35,769 --> 0:3:37,17
- Did it?
- No.


103
0:3:37,17 --> 0:3:38,572
She lost every dime.


104
0:3:38,572 --> 0:3:41,308
And madam C.J. Walker
never spoke to her again.


105
0:3:41,308 --> 0:3:42,509
Wow.


106
0:3:42,509 --> 0:3:45,45
- Yeah, she was pretty special.


107
0:3:45,45 --> 0:3:46,646
- Wow, this is
the weirdest-looking leg


108
0:3:46,646 --> 0:3:47,914
I have ever seen.


109
0:3:47,914 --> 0:3:50,851
- Yeah, that's Nick's
great Uncle Blackie.


110
0:3:50,851 --> 0:3:53,253
And he wasn't white.
He was an albino.


111
0:3:53,253 --> 0:3:55,689
- Then why'd they
call him Blackie?


112
0:3:55,689 --> 0:3:56,79
- Because if they didn't,


113
0:3:56,79 --> 0:3:58,525
everybody would have thought
he was white.


114
0:3:58,525 --> 0:4:0,327
- Oh, it's kind of like
the first the rock.


115
0:4:0,327 --> 0:4:10,537
Special.


116
0:4:10,537 --> 0:4:13,407
- Hey, man.
Here's your package.


117
0:4:13,407 --> 0:4:15,375
Man, you got
your feet up on my...


118
0:4:15,375 --> 0:4:16,81
What the hell?


119
0:4:16,81 --> 0:4:18,245
Martin.


120
0:4:18,245 --> 0:4:19,613
Martin!


121
0:4:19,613 --> 0:4:20,814
Are you okay?


122
0:4:20,814 --> 0:4:21,915
- He can't hear you.


123
0:4:21,915 --> 0:4:24,251
What you lookin' at here...


124
0:4:24,251 --> 0:4:28,155
Is the latest in advanced
field-interrogation <i>apparati.</i>


125
0:4:28,155 --> 0:4:29,923
- It's not just a box
on his head?


126
0:4:29,923 --> 0:4:30,957
- No, it's not.


127
0:4:30,957 --> 0:4:32,492
It's the all-new,


128
0:4:32,492 --> 0:4:39,65
portable
sensory-deprivation chamber.


129
0:4:39,65 --> 0:4:41,701
Oh, God. Free at last.


130
0:4:41,701 --> 0:4:43,703
They use that thing on people?


131
0:4:43,703 --> 0:4:47,541
- Not if you tell us
what we need to know.


132
0:4:47,541 --> 0:4:49,42
- Hey, man.


133
0:4:49,42 --> 0:4:51,144
Thanks for signing
for my package.


134
0:4:51,144 --> 0:4:52,479
- Why are you having
all this stuff


135
0:4:52,479 --> 0:4:53,947
sent to my house anyway?


136
0:4:53,947 --> 0:4:57,918
- You think I'm crazy enough
to let people know my address?


137
0:4:57,918 --> 0:4:59,719
- Or is it that the post office
doesn't deliver


138
0:4:59,719 --> 0:5:2,422
to a windowless black van?


139
0:5:2,422 --> 0:5:5,292
- How you know it's black?


140
0:5:5,292 --> 0:5:6,46
- Okay, so what's in that one?


141
0:5:6,46 --> 0:5:8,128
- Oh, that's just some socks.


142
0:5:8,128 --> 0:5:10,33
Argyle.


143
0:5:10,33 --> 0:5:11,498
What's that?


144
0:5:11,498 --> 0:5:14,601
- What? What could it be?
- What is what?


145
0:5:14,601 --> 0:5:17,137
- So lame.


146
0:5:17,137 --> 0:5:18,939
So...


147
0:5:18,939 --> 0:5:21,475
Suzanne is meeting up
with Ray savage, huh?


148
0:5:21,475 --> 0:5:23,9
- Yeah. Why?


149
0:5:23,9 --> 0:5:26,12
- Let's just say my man has
a bit of a...reputation,


150
0:5:26,12 --> 0:5:28,782
and that Sandra Bullock would
do well to stay away from it.


151
0:5:28,782 --> 0:5:31,751
- Yeah, well, Suzanne's
just doing business with him.


152
0:5:31,751 --> 0:5:39,726
- Okay. I'm just saying,
keep your eye on that guy.


153
0:5:39,726 --> 0:5:41,161
- Good morning.


154
0:5:41,161 --> 0:5:42,162
- Hey, baby.


155
0:5:42,162 --> 0:5:43,563
I saved you some breakfast.


156
0:5:43,563 --> 0:5:45,265
The kids left
for school already.


157
0:5:45,265 --> 0:5:46,299
- Thank you.


158
0:5:46,299 --> 0:5:48,768
I didn't realize
it was so late.


159
0:5:48,768 --> 0:5:51,37
- Hmm. What time
you'd get in last night?


160
0:5:51,37 --> 0:5:52,806
- I don't know.
Around midnight.


161
0:5:52,806 --> 0:5:57,878
- Oh, that was a long meeting.


162
0:5:57,878 --> 0:5:59,546
Well, I guess you guys
got everything


163
0:5:59,546 --> 0:6:1,781
pretty much figured out.


164
0:6:1,781 --> 0:6:4,484
- Nick, I know you don't want
to admit this,


165
0:6:4,484 --> 0:6:7,988
but you should just say it,
"I am jealous."


166
0:6:7,988 --> 0:6:9,589
- I am not jealous.


167
0:6:9,589 --> 0:6:11,258
- If it makes you feel
any better,


168
0:6:11,258 --> 0:6:12,759
Ray was the perfect gentleman.


169
0:6:12,759 --> 0:6:15,161
All he did all night
was talk about the kids.


170
0:6:15,161 --> 0:6:17,13
- At a hotel lounge
at 1:00 in the morning.


171
0:6:17,13 --> 0:6:20,267
- I was not there
at 1:00 in the morning.


172
0:6:20,267 --> 0:6:23,436
- Well, you weren't here.


173
0:6:23,436 --> 0:6:24,671
- Yes, I was.


174
0:6:24,671 --> 0:6:27,974
- So you do know
what time you came in?


175
0:6:27,974 --> 0:6:31,211
- Yes, after you were asleep
and before 1:00 A.M.


176
0:6:31,211 --> 0:6:32,812
I can't believe you.


177
0:6:32,812 --> 0:6:34,18
- Oh, you can't believe me?


178
0:6:34,18 --> 0:6:37,35
What if I was the one coming in
at who knows what time?


179
0:6:37,35 --> 0:6:39,886
- After 12:00 and before 1:00.


180
0:6:39,886 --> 0:6:41,788
- In a hotel lobby
with some strange woman?


181
0:6:41,788 --> 0:6:42,989
- That I introduced you to.


182
0:6:42,989 --> 0:6:44,925
- Well, what difference
does it make how I met her?


183
0:6:44,925 --> 0:6:46,459
- I wouldn't introduce you
to somebody


184
0:6:46,459 --> 0:6:48,194
that I was worried about
you being around?


185
0:6:48,194 --> 0:6:49,663
- Well, what if
you didn't get worried


186
0:6:49,663 --> 0:6:50,83
until after I was around her?


187
0:6:50,83 --> 0:6:52,165
- And why would I be worried?


188
0:6:52,165 --> 0:6:54,367
- Because I came home
after 12:00 and before 1:00


189
0:6:54,367 --> 0:6:58,138
when I said
I'd be back by 10:00.


190
0:6:58,138 --> 0:7:4,871
And, yeah, I'm jealous.


191
0:7:4,871 --> 0:7:6,406
- Okay, so at 6:00 P.M.,


192
0:7:6,406 --> 0:7:8,475
we'll have
the celebrity basketball game.


193
0:7:8,475 --> 0:7:9,843
And that should give us
enough time


194
0:7:9,843 --> 0:7:12,278
to open the doors at 9:30
for the comedy show.


195
0:7:12,278 --> 0:7:13,213
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.


196
0:7:13,213 --> 0:7:14,647
You think we can get
Wanda Sykes?


197
0:7:14,647 --> 0:7:16,983
- You think we can bet
a big, fat check?


198
0:7:16,983 --> 0:7:18,485
- Bob Saget'll work.


199
0:7:18,485 --> 0:7:20,82
- Suzanne,
can you come over here


200
0:7:20,82 --> 0:7:22,155
and take a look at this web page?


201
0:7:22,155 --> 0:7:23,323
- Just send me a link.


202
0:7:23,323 --> 0:7:25,325
- You know, I don't know
how to do that.


203
0:7:25,325 --> 0:7:26,593
- I'll help you
with that, baby.


204
0:7:26,593 --> 0:7:27,861
- No, thank you.


205
0:7:27,861 --> 0:7:29,729
Suzanne, I really need you
to come look at it.


206
0:7:29,729 --> 0:7:32,165
- Flowers for
Mrs. Kingston-persons.


207
0:7:32,165 --> 0:7:35,68
- Oh, thank you.


208
0:7:35,68 --> 0:7:36,936
So...


209
0:7:36,936 --> 0:7:38,638
What's this?


210
0:7:38,638 --> 0:7:41,41
- Ah, my check.
- Oh.


211
0:7:41,41 --> 0:7:43,877
Thank you.
But it's missing a zero.


212
0:7:43,877 --> 0:7:46,12
- Uh, you know what, I think you
might have to earn that.


213
0:7:46,12 --> 0:7:47,747
- If I work too hard,


214
0:7:47,747 --> 0:7:49,449
you're not gonna be able
to afford me.


215
0:7:49,449 --> 0:7:51,17
- Mmm.


216
0:7:51,17 --> 0:7:53,987
- So, Gigi,
what'd you want to...


217
0:7:53,987 --> 0:7:55,388
Did you see where Gigi went?


218
0:7:55,388 --> 0:7:56,923
- I wasn't watching her.


219
0:7:56,923 --> 0:8:0,86
I was watching you.


220
0:8:0,86 --> 0:8:3,329
- Okay. Sure.


221
0:8:3,329 --> 0:8:4,931
So when will you need me
to pick that up?


222
0:8:4,931 --> 0:8:6,633
- Hello?


223
0:8:6,633 --> 0:8:8,601
- So can you explain to me
exactly what it is


224
0:8:8,601 --> 0:8:9,869
you're trying to do.


225
0:8:9,869 --> 0:8:11,171
- Oh, I'm sorry.


226
0:8:11,171 --> 0:8:12,839
I have no idea
what you're talking about.


227
0:8:12,839 --> 0:8:14,24
- No, uh, uh, I'm sorry.


228
0:8:14,24 --> 0:8:16,543
It's just... it's a little
too close for comfort.


229
0:8:16,543 --> 0:8:17,71
- Yeah.


230
0:8:17,71 --> 0:8:20,46
Well, I understand
your concern.


231
0:8:20,46 --> 0:8:22,48
But I don't think
that's gonna be an issue.


232
0:8:22,48 --> 0:8:24,184
- Yeah, well,
I just want you to know,


233
0:8:24,184 --> 0:8:25,652
I've done
a full background check,


234
0:8:25,652 --> 0:8:27,187
and it turns out not only
is the client


235
0:8:27,187 --> 0:8:28,555
married to another firm,


236
0:8:28,555 --> 0:8:31,157
but he's doing business
with several small companies


237
0:8:31,157 --> 0:8:32,525
around town.


238
0:8:32,525 --> 0:8:33,793
Yes.


239
0:8:33,793 --> 0:8:35,662
Yeah, I just don't think
this is a relationship


240
0:8:35,662 --> 0:8:36,863
we want to continue.


241
0:8:36,863 --> 0:8:38,598
- Well, I've got everything
under control,


242
0:8:38,598 --> 0:8:40,934
and I'm gonna wrap this up
in a couple of days,


243
0:8:40,934 --> 0:8:42,102
and I'll talk to you then.


244
0:8:42,102 --> 0:8:43,436
Okay? All right.


245
0:8:43,436 --> 0:8:44,637
Thanks so much for calling.


246
0:8:44,637 --> 0:8:46,106
Buh-bye.


247
0:8:46,106 --> 0:8:47,14
- Yeah, okay.


248
0:8:47,14 --> 0:8:48,875
Okay. Yeah.


249
0:8:48,875 --> 0:8:50,43
Mm-Hmm.


250
0:8:50,43 --> 0:8:51,611
Yeah, I just want you to know


251
0:8:51,611 --> 0:8:53,446
that I'm not happy
with the situation.


252
0:8:53,446 --> 0:8:54,781
Right.


253
0:8:54,781 --> 0:8:56,749
Yeah, and I can't promise
to keep my mouth closed.


254
0:8:56,749 --> 0:8:58,985
Right. Okay.


255
0:8:58,985 --> 0:9:0,286
All right.


256
0:9:0,286 --> 0:9:3,456
Bye-bye.


257
0:9:3,456 --> 0:9:4,858
- Gigi, what'd you want
to show me?


258
0:9:4,858 --> 0:9:6,259
- I sent you the link.


259
0:9:6,259 --> 0:9:7,56
- Ladies,


260
0:9:7,56 --> 0:9:9,596
as much as I've enjoyed
the pleasure of your company,


261
0:9:9,596 --> 0:9:12,465
I have a stadium to fill
and bases to steal.


262
0:9:12,465 --> 0:9:13,633
- Oh, that's too bad.


263
0:9:13,633 --> 0:9:14,901
Let me get your jacket.


264
0:9:14,901 --> 0:9:17,904
- I didn't bring one.
- Take one anyway.


265
0:9:17,904 --> 0:9:19,606
- Uh, I'll text you later.
- Bye.


266
0:9:19,606 --> 0:9:20,974
Bye!


267
0:9:20,974 --> 0:9:22,775
- Yeah.
- B-y-e.


268
0:9:22,775 --> 0:9:28,948
Bye.


269
0:9:28,948 --> 0:9:32,18
- And then in 1956,
granny "V" lost her house


270
0:9:32,18 --> 0:9:33,353
and moved into a retirement home


271
0:9:33,353 --> 0:9:35,388
after spending
her entire savings


272
0:9:35,388 --> 0:9:38,458
in an attempt to market water
sold inside of bottles.


273
0:9:38,458 --> 0:9:39,592
What do you think so far?


274
0:9:39,592 --> 0:9:40,66
- Boring.


275
0:9:40,66 --> 0:9:42,729
What you should do
is write that report


276
0:9:42,729 --> 0:9:45,765
on somebody who's
ten times more interesting,


277
0:9:45,765 --> 0:9:49,68
more dynamic,
mystious, and handsome.


278
0:9:49,68 --> 0:9:51,638
- Like who?
- Like me.


279
0:9:51,638 --> 0:9:53,64
- Well, I guess
it's not too late.


280
0:9:53,64 --> 0:9:55,909
Do you mind if I ask you
some questions to start?


281
0:9:55,909 --> 0:9:57,71
- Shoot.
- When were you born?


282
0:9:57,71 --> 0:10:1,481
- I was born on the 127th day
in the Chinese year


283
0:10:1,481 --> 0:10:3,183
of the Yang metal dog.


284
0:10:3,183 --> 0:10:4,751
- Can you give me a number?


285
0:10:4,751 --> 0:10:6,519
- 4667.


286
0:10:6,519 --> 0:10:9,589
Dang, are you they teaching
y'all anything in school?


287
0:10:9,589 --> 0:10:11,191
- What's your middle name?


288
0:10:11,191 --> 0:10:12,625
- I don't want to tell you.


289
0:10:12,625 --> 0:10:14,694
- Is that top-secret too?


290
0:10:14,694 --> 0:10:16,596
- No. I just don't like it.


291
0:10:16,596 --> 0:10:18,998
- Is there anything
you <i>can</i> tell me.


292
0:10:18,998 --> 0:10:22,135
- Lindsey, I told you enough,
all right?


293
0:10:22,135 --> 0:10:23,67
I told you
I have a middle name.


294
0:10:23,67 --> 0:10:24,971
I told you my birthday.


295
0:10:24,971 --> 0:10:26,372
You know I'm your uncle.


296
0:10:26,372 --> 0:10:28,107
You still can't write it?


297
0:10:28,107 --> 0:10:31,244
- Look, I once had to do
a report, 300 pages,


298
0:10:31,244 --> 0:10:33,813
off of a severed ear
I found in the sand,


299
0:10:33,813 --> 0:10:36,616
using the severed ear.


300
0:10:36,616 --> 0:10:37,917
Tell me,
could granny "V" do that?


301
0:10:37,917 --> 0:10:39,285
- Mm-mm.
- Uh-uh.


302
0:10:39,285 --> 0:10:41,2
Now, when you finish
your report on me,


303
0:10:41,2 --> 0:10:42,555
I need to look at that
because I might


304
0:10:42,555 --> 0:10:44,591
have to redact a few things,
you know what I mean?


305
0:10:44,591 --> 0:10:45,558
I done told you enough.


306
0:10:45,558 --> 0:10:47,293
Tell your father thanks
for the package.


307
0:10:47,293 --> 0:10:48,695
- What is in that anyway?


308
0:10:48,695 --> 0:10:51,664
- Oh, this is
a sonic annihilator.


309
0:10:51,664 --> 0:10:53,366
- What's a sonic annihilator do?


310
0:10:53,366 --> 0:10:57,637
- It delivers an incapacitating,
seemingly silent shot of sound


311
0:10:57,637 --> 0:10:59,272
to any hostile target.


312
0:10:59,272 --> 0:11:0,473
- Mm.


313
0:11:0,473 --> 0:11:2,642
- It's the latest
in nonlethal close combat.


314
0:11:2,642 --> 0:11:8,147
Watch this. Kevin!


315
0:11:8,147 --> 0:11:9,515
- Oh, my God.


316
0:11:9,515 --> 0:11:10,817
Is he gonna be okay?


317
0:11:10,817 --> 0:11:12,619
- Uh, yeah, you know what,


318
0:11:12,619 --> 0:11:14,187
just... just wrap him up
in a snuggie


319
0:11:14,187 --> 0:11:15,755
and don't tell your mom
I was here.


320
0:11:15,755 --> 0:11:27,333
Uh...What's that?


321
0:11:27,333 --> 0:11:30,336
- Ugh!


322
0:11:30,336 --> 0:11:33,906
- Yeah, I forgot my keys.


323
0:11:33,906 --> 0:11:39,112
What's that?


324
0:11:39,112 --> 0:11:43,783
- Two pizzas, 20 minutes. Cool.


325
0:11:43,783 --> 0:11:46,19
Ooh-whee.


326
0:11:46,19 --> 0:11:48,921
Look at you. You look amazing.


327
0:11:48,921 --> 0:11:50,123
- Thank you, honey.


328
0:11:50,123 --> 0:11:52,358
You look nice too.
Where are you going?


329
0:11:52,358 --> 0:11:54,961
- I'm going out with you.


330
0:11:54,961 --> 0:11:56,95
Dinner, movies.


331
0:11:56,95 --> 0:11:57,297
Four stars, remember?


332
0:11:57,297 --> 0:12:0,433
- Oh, Nick. I'm so sorry.


333
0:12:0,433 --> 0:12:2,869
I forgot. Can we reschedule?


334
0:12:2,869 --> 0:12:4,504
- You forgot we were going out?


335
0:12:4,504 --> 0:12:5,672
- I forgot.


336
0:12:5,672 --> 0:12:7,173
- Then, why are you dressed
like that?


337
0:12:7,173 --> 0:12:9,442
- I told Ray I would meet him
and his partners again tonight


338
0:12:9,442 --> 0:12:11,511
so we could finalize everything.


339
0:12:11,511 --> 0:12:12,945
- Dressed like that?


340
0:12:12,945 --> 0:12:20,753
Where's the meeting... Vegas?


341
0:12:20,753 --> 0:12:22,522
- Nick.


342
0:12:22,522 --> 0:12:24,123
It's at a restaurant.


343
0:12:24,123 --> 0:12:25,758
- Does your dress know that?


344
0:12:25,758 --> 0:12:26,859
- Nick, stop it.


345
0:12:26,859 --> 0:12:28,227
- I don't have to stop it.


346
0:12:28,227 --> 0:12:30,763
Look, when you didn't like women
I was working with,


347
0:12:30,763 --> 0:12:32,632
you were ready to upside
people's heads


348
0:12:32,632 --> 0:12:34,0
and put bullets
in their behinds.


349
0:12:34,0 --> 0:12:36,169
- That was different.
- How?


350
0:12:36,169 --> 0:12:38,71
- Okay, that wasn't different.


351
0:12:38,71 --> 0:12:40,106
But, Nick, if you just
give me a chance


352
0:12:40,106 --> 0:12:41,607
to finalize everything tonight,


353
0:12:41,607 --> 0:12:44,31
after that, I promise,
I am all yours.


354
0:12:44,31 --> 0:12:47,613
- Okay. You go ahead.


355
0:12:47,613 --> 0:12:48,848
But while you at dinner,


356
0:12:48,848 --> 0:12:50,583
I want you to think
of something.


357
0:12:50,583 --> 0:12:51,551
- What's that?


358
0:12:51,551 --> 0:12:55,588
- Me, here, hungry,


359
0:12:55,588 --> 0:12:58,858
alone, and sad,


360
0:12:58,858 --> 0:13:0,293
watching a one-star movie.


361
0:13:0,293 --> 0:13:1,794
- Okay, now, that's low.


362
0:13:1,794 --> 0:13:3,496
- Not lower than me.


363
0:13:3,496 --> 0:13:5,298
- Oh, my God.


364
0:13:5,298 --> 0:13:15,83
- Have fun.


365
0:13:15,83 --> 0:13:17,418
- I'll take another one, please,
and one for her too.


366
0:13:17,418 --> 0:13:18,686
- Uh, no, actually.


367
0:13:18,686 --> 0:13:20,388
Thank you. I'm fine.


368
0:13:20,388 --> 0:13:22,19
- Yes, you are.


369
0:13:22,19 --> 0:13:23,725
- Thanks.


370
0:13:23,725 --> 0:13:24,959
- Come on. Loosen up.


371
0:13:24,959 --> 0:13:26,494
Let's have some fun.


372
0:13:26,494 --> 0:13:29,464
- You know, Ray, I like having
fun as much the next person,


373
0:13:29,464 --> 0:13:31,9
but I'm actually here
to discuss business.


374
0:13:31,9 --> 0:13:33,868
- Okay, ivanka trump.


375
0:13:33,868 --> 0:13:36,504
Let's discuss business,
all right?


376
0:13:36,504 --> 0:13:38,606
- Okay, thank you.
- Business.


377
0:13:38,606 --> 0:13:41,743
- So I was thinking we could get
all the local food restaurants


378
0:13:41,743 --> 0:13:43,878
to sponsor food tents,
and that way, they could...


379
0:13:43,878 --> 0:13:45,914
W-what... what are you doing?


380
0:13:45,914 --> 0:13:48,82
- I couldn't see your face
when you were talking.


381
0:13:48,82 --> 0:13:51,52
- You want to go somewhere
where there's more light?


382
0:13:51,52 --> 0:13:53,922
- I was thinking someplace
with less light.


383
0:13:53,922 --> 0:13:55,29
- Can we bring your wife?


384
0:13:55,29 --> 0:13:57,926
- She's with the kids.


385
0:13:57,926 --> 0:14:0,395
Hey, my boy's got
a table at the club.


386
0:14:0,395 --> 0:14:2,664
Let's roll over there,
and we can talk on the way.


387
0:14:2,664 --> 0:14:4,933
- Ray, I'm not going
to a club with you.


388
0:14:4,933 --> 0:14:6,968
- Come on,
Suzanne Kingston-persons.


389
0:14:6,968 --> 0:14:8,703
Look, if we're gonna
discuss business,


390
0:14:8,703 --> 0:14:10,905
we gotta hit this club,
and we got to hit it right.


391
0:14:10,905 --> 0:14:12,507
Let's ride.


392
0:14:12,507 --> 0:14:13,508
I see ride in your eyes.


393
0:14:13,508 --> 0:14:14,776
Are you rolling or not?
Come on.


394
0:14:14,776 --> 0:14:20,14
- I'll take "or not" for $20.


395
0:14:20,14 --> 0:14:21,349
- Girl, quit playing.


396
0:14:21,349 --> 0:14:22,984
Ser...


397
0:14:22,984 --> 0:14:24,786
Hey, I'll text you the address.


398
0:14:24,786 --> 0:14:37,265
No, serious...
I'll see you there.


399
0:14:37,265 --> 0:14:38,7
- Hey, babe.


400
0:14:38,7 --> 0:14:40,301
- Hey.


401
0:14:40,301 --> 0:14:42,503
What are you doing here
so early?


402
0:14:42,503 --> 0:14:44,405
I didn't expect to see you
till the morning.


403
0:14:44,405 --> 0:14:46,207
- Okay, okay. I'm sorry.


404
0:14:46,207 --> 0:14:47,475
I was wrong.


405
0:14:47,475 --> 0:14:49,978
- Well, I hope you got
all your work done.


406
0:14:49,978 --> 0:14:53,114
I hate to think I was sitting
here sad and lonely for nothing.


407
0:14:53,114 --> 0:14:57,452
- Okay, Nick, stop it.


408
0:14:57,452 --> 0:15:1,22
Nick, Ray hit on me.


409
0:15:1,22 --> 0:15:2,357
- Really?


410
0:15:2,357 --> 0:15:5,259
You mean to tell me you met
a guy in a dark place


411
0:15:5,259 --> 0:15:7,528
late at night in a sexy dress
and he hit on you?


412
0:15:7,528 --> 0:15:9,664
Really?


413
0:15:9,664 --> 0:15:10,832
I'm shocked.


414
0:15:10,832 --> 0:15:12,967
In other news,
ice cream is cold.


415
0:15:12,967 --> 0:15:15,703
- You're not mad, are you?


416
0:15:15,703 --> 0:15:17,138
- A little bit.


417
0:15:17,138 --> 0:15:18,539
How am I supposed to feel?


418
0:15:18,539 --> 0:15:20,475
- Disappointed but proud of me


419
0:15:20,475 --> 0:15:22,644
that as soon as I realized
what was happening,


420
0:15:22,644 --> 0:15:24,145
I got out there and came home.


421
0:15:24,145 --> 0:15:26,948
- Nah, I'm gonna stick
with mad.


422
0:15:26,948 --> 0:15:29,15
So what now?


423
0:15:29,15 --> 0:15:31,85
- Well, tomorrow I'll have Ray
come to the office.


424
0:15:31,85 --> 0:15:32,62
I'll return his deposit,


425
0:15:32,62 --> 0:15:34,822
and I'll tell him
I can't take the job.


426
0:15:34,822 --> 0:15:36,157
- Good.


427
0:15:36,157 --> 0:15:38,459
'Cause you have a lot of work
to do at home.


428
0:15:38,459 --> 0:15:40,795
- When do I start?


429
0:15:40,795 --> 0:15:42,997
- Right after the game goes off.


430
0:15:42,997 --> 0:15:45,299
- After the game?


431
0:15:45,299 --> 0:15:53,808
- Yeah, unless you want me
to be sad.


432
0:15:53,808 --> 0:15:56,77
Good morning, everybody.
- Hey, dad.


433
0:15:56,77 --> 0:15:58,312
- Knock knock.


434
0:15:58,312 --> 0:15:59,414
- Hey, Terrence.


435
0:15:59,414 --> 0:16:0,915
- Hey, Dick.


436
0:16:0,915 --> 0:16:2,5
Where's baby sis?


437
0:16:2,5 --> 0:16:3,51
- Here I am.


438
0:16:3,51 --> 0:16:4,185
- Look, we need to talk.


439
0:16:4,185 --> 0:16:6,54
- Okay.
- About what?


440
0:16:6,54 --> 0:16:8,256
- First of all, I think you need
to get these kids out of here,


441
0:16:8,256 --> 0:16:9,724
'cause this is
grown-folk business.


442
0:16:9,724 --> 0:16:13,294
- Kevin, Lindsey, please go
finish getting ready for school.


443
0:16:13,294 --> 0:16:15,396
- Okay.


444
0:16:15,396 --> 0:16:16,864
- Kevin, get moving.


445
0:16:16,864 --> 0:16:17,965
- Good morning.


446
0:16:17,965 --> 0:16:20,334
- Boy, what is wrong
with your hearing?


447
0:16:20,334 --> 0:16:22,904
- Hey, Kevin.


448
0:16:22,904 --> 0:16:24,405
You gotta get ready
for school now.


449
0:16:24,405 --> 0:16:26,24
- Oh, okay.


450
0:16:26,24 --> 0:16:27,542
I'll catch ya later.


451
0:16:27,542 --> 0:16:29,343
- Oh, calculator?
Yes, in the drawer.


452
0:16:29,343 --> 0:16:31,612
- What is wrong with that boy?
- I don't know.


453
0:16:31,612 --> 0:16:33,614
- It's them damn Dr. Dre
headphones you bought him.


454
0:16:33,614 --> 0:16:34,982
I told ya they was too loud.


455
0:16:34,982 --> 0:16:38,419
- Okay, so what is going on,
Terrence?


456
0:16:38,419 --> 0:16:39,754
- You tell me.


457
0:16:39,754 --> 0:16:42,99
What's this I hear about you
all up in the club,


458
0:16:42,99 --> 0:16:45,693
getting close and personal
with Ray Savage?


459
0:16:45,693 --> 0:16:47,962
- You know what,
is this any of your business?


460
0:16:47,962 --> 0:16:49,363
- You my baby sis, right?


461
0:16:49,363 --> 0:16:51,466
- Yeah.
- And you knew about this, man?


462
0:16:51,466 --> 0:16:52,567
- It's not what you think.


463
0:16:52,567 --> 0:16:54,235
Suzanne was there for work.


464
0:16:54,235 --> 0:16:56,437
I guess he had some other ideas.


465
0:16:56,437 --> 0:16:59,707
- But I came home,
and I told my husband, Nick.


466
0:16:59,707 --> 0:17:1,75
Okay? Are you happy?


467
0:17:1,75 --> 0:17:4,11
- No. I'm not happy. All right?


468
0:17:4,11 --> 0:17:5,68
I got a reputation.


469
0:17:5,68 --> 0:17:8,483
I can't have my little sister's
name drug through the streets.


470
0:17:8,483 --> 0:17:10,251
- Hey, man.
Don't worry about that.


471
0:17:10,251 --> 0:17:12,86
Look, you can't stop
people from talking,


472
0:17:12,86 --> 0:17:14,522
especially when they don't know
what they're talking about.


473
0:17:14,522 --> 0:17:16,457
- I know that's right,


474
0:17:16,457 --> 0:17:18,359
'cause I don't brought down
more than a few people


475
0:17:18,359 --> 0:17:20,962
with my campaigns
of misinformation.


476
0:17:20,962 --> 0:17:22,93
You heard about mubarak?


477
0:17:22,93 --> 0:17:24,332
- You did that?


478
0:17:24,332 --> 0:17:25,5
- Did what?


479
0:17:25,5 --> 0:17:28,402
- Nothing.


480
0:17:28,402 --> 0:17:29,871
- I got your package.


481
0:17:29,871 --> 0:17:32,306
- Oh, yeah. Thanks, man.


482
0:17:32,306 --> 0:17:34,342
This should be the last one.


483
0:17:34,342 --> 0:17:36,811
- What in the world?


484
0:17:36,811 --> 0:17:38,98
- Oh, whoa.


485
0:17:38,98 --> 0:17:40,281
- What is that?


486
0:17:40,281 --> 0:17:44,152
- I can't tell you,
but it's not socks.


487
0:17:44,152 --> 0:17:45,686
Man, you're a better man
than me, trick.


488
0:17:45,686 --> 0:17:48,556
Look, man, if my wife was
in the club with some dude


489
0:17:48,556 --> 0:17:51,926
and he was pushing all on her,
man, I don't know what I'd do.


490
0:17:51,926 --> 0:17:53,528
- Let's just hope
you wouldn't have done


491
0:17:53,528 --> 0:17:55,963
whatever you was gonna do
with whatever's in that package.


492
0:17:55,963 --> 0:17:57,799
- Ah, man, this ain't gonna
do nothing to you.


493
0:17:57,799 --> 0:17:59,534
This ain't nothing
but a blow-dryer.


494
0:17:59,534 --> 0:18:6,808
See y'all later.


495
0:18:6,808 --> 0:18:8,776
- Hey, good morning, ladies.


496
0:18:8,776 --> 0:18:9,844
- Hi, Ray.


497
0:18:9,844 --> 0:18:11,312
- We gonna get down
to some business?


498
0:18:11,312 --> 0:18:13,314
You know, we could have took
care of this last night.


499
0:18:13,314 --> 0:18:14,982
- I'm sorry, but we're not
going to be able


500
0:18:14,982 --> 0:18:16,117
to coordinate your event.


501
0:18:16,117 --> 0:18:17,919
- Oh, well, I thought
this was a done deal.


502
0:18:17,919 --> 0:18:20,154
- Well, it's not.


503
0:18:20,154 --> 0:18:21,389
- Well, then,
what have we been doing


504
0:18:21,389 --> 0:18:22,49
for the past few days, then?


505
0:18:22,49 --> 0:18:24,625
- I was about to ask you
the same question.


506
0:18:24,625 --> 0:18:27,461
- Whoa.
What's that supposed to mean?


507
0:18:27,461 --> 0:18:29,73
- Wow.


508
0:18:29,73 --> 0:18:31,666
You aren't going to
actually stand there


509
0:18:31,666 --> 0:18:34,569
and act like you don't know why
you've been inviting my wife


510
0:18:34,569 --> 0:18:35,77
out to clubs and dinners


511
0:18:35,77 --> 0:18:38,39
and hotels
for the past few days?


512
0:18:38,39 --> 0:18:38,973
Really, Ray?


513
0:18:38,973 --> 0:18:40,408
Are you gonna come at me
like that?


514
0:18:40,408 --> 0:18:41,742
- Hey, man.


515
0:18:41,742 --> 0:18:43,344
I was doing it for the kids.


516
0:18:43,344 --> 0:18:47,315
- You know what, man,
I think you better go,


517
0:18:47,315 --> 0:18:49,35
'cause what I'm about to do


518
0:18:49,35 --> 0:18:53,2
ain't got nothing to do
with the kids.


519
0:18:53,2 --> 0:18:54,422
- Oh?
- Yeah.


520
0:18:54,422 --> 0:18:55,623
- Oh-ho.


521
0:18:55,623 --> 0:18:57,291
Are you threatening me?


522
0:18:57,291 --> 0:18:58,559
- He just said
what he about to do


523
0:18:58,559 --> 0:18:59,994
ain't got nothing to do
with the kids.


524
0:18:59,994 --> 0:19:1,329
What part of
"ain't for the kids"


525
0:19:1,329 --> 0:19:2,396
don't you understand?


526
0:19:2,396 --> 0:19:8,369
- It's time for you to go.


527
0:19:8,369 --> 0:19:10,972
- I've been hit
by a pitch before.


528
0:19:10,972 --> 0:19:12,607
Call me.
- Bye.


529
0:19:12,607 --> 0:19:14,75
- Tweet me.
- Bye.


530
0:19:14,75 --> 0:19:15,409
- Facebook.
- Bye.


531
0:19:15,409 --> 0:19:16,611
- Skype.
- Bye.


532
0:19:16,611 --> 0:19:21,82
- Hey, brother.


533
0:19:21,82 --> 0:19:28,169
- BBN.
- Bye.


534
0:19:28,169 --> 0:19:29,971
- Even after she moved
into a retirement home,


535
0:19:29,971 --> 0:19:32,707
granny "V" remained
as active as ever.


536
0:19:32,707 --> 0:19:36,1
In 1955, after eating a dinner
of barbecued ribs,


537
0:19:36,1 --> 0:19:38,512
granny "V" complained that there
wasn't enough meat on the bones


538
0:19:38,512 --> 0:19:40,348
and wrote a letter
to the butcher.


539
0:19:40,348 --> 0:19:42,583
Afterwards, she became
a local spokesperson


540
0:19:42,583 --> 0:19:44,719
for their new-and-improved
meatier ribs,


541
0:19:44,719 --> 0:19:46,687
when her slogan,
"where's the pork?",


542
0:19:46,687 --> 0:19:49,49
became the tag-line
on their radio and tv ads.


543
0:19:49,49 --> 0:19:51,759
- Very good.
- Nice job.


544
0:19:51,759 --> 0:19:53,6
- Wow.


545
0:19:53,6 --> 0:19:55,496
Oh, sweetheart,
that was just beautiful.


546
0:19:55,496 --> 0:19:58,466
Your granny "V" would be
so honored.


547
0:19:58,466 --> 0:19:59,867
- And thanks so much, Marilyn.


548
0:19:59,867 --> 0:20:2,36
I couldn't have done any of this
without your help.


549
0:20:2,36 --> 0:20:3,938
- Oh, baby, you are so welcome.


550
0:20:3,938 --> 0:20:5,506
Now, if you'll excuse me,


551
0:20:5,506 --> 0:20:9,31
there seems to be a hole
in the bottom of my glass.


552
0:20:9,31 --> 0:20:12,513
- Lindsey, that was
a very well-written essay.


553
0:20:12,513 --> 0:20:13,447
- Thanks, dad.


554
0:20:13,447 --> 0:20:16,284
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.


555
0:20:16,284 --> 0:20:18,19
- Wow.


556
0:20:18,19 --> 0:20:19,887
She did a great job
on that paper.


557
0:20:19,887 --> 0:20:20,888
- I know.


558
0:20:20,888 --> 0:20:22,323
Too bad none of it was true.


559
0:20:22,323 --> 0:20:25,159
- What? You lied to Lindsey?


560
0:20:25,159 --> 0:20:27,94
- Embellished.


561
0:20:27,94 --> 0:20:28,396
Well, what was I gonna do?


562
0:20:28,396 --> 0:20:29,563
She needed help with her paper.


563
0:20:29,563 --> 0:20:30,765
What was I gonna tell her?


564
0:20:30,765 --> 0:20:32,633
My granny "V" was
a big, fat liar?


565
0:20:32,633 --> 0:20:34,802
Spent her last few years
in the crazy house?


566
0:20:34,802 --> 0:20:36,871
- Ma, you never told me that.


567
0:20:36,871 --> 0:20:38,239
- I didn't?


568
0:20:38,239 --> 0:20:39,941
Well, sorry.


569
0:20:39,941 --> 0:20:41,842
But, in my defense,


570
0:20:41,842 --> 0:20:44,345
everything I told her was stuff
that people told me


571
0:20:44,345 --> 0:20:45,513
until I got older


572
0:20:45,513 --> 0:20:47,248
and other people told me
it wasn't true,


573
0:20:47,248 --> 0:20:48,749
which I am now telling you,


574
0:20:48,749 --> 0:20:50,584
which you can tell her one day.


575
0:20:50,584 --> 0:20:53,54
Anyway, let me know
what grade she gets.


576
0:20:53,54 --> 0:20:57,584
And if there's trouble
at school, don't call me.


577
0:20:57,584 --> 0:22:57,584
