2
0:0:10,37 --> 0:0:11,6
DAVID CHOE: Quick recap.


3
0:0:11,6 --> 0:0:16,37
We got picked up in a van, like
a delivery maintenance


4
0:0:16,37 --> 0:0:21,12
van with a older white lady,
someone that looked like her


5
0:0:21,12 --> 0:0:25,44
son or her boyfriend that was
about to go in the Army, and a


6
0:0:25,44 --> 0:0:27,5
shady Mexican guy in
the back seat.


7
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:28,5
We pulled over.


8
0:0:28,5 --> 0:0:29,97
She got into a truck--


9
0:0:29,97 --> 0:0:32,33
like, a 18 wheeler truck
and drove away.


10
0:0:32,33 --> 0:0:33,83
Her son went into Walmart.


11
0:0:33,83 --> 0:0:38,9
And then Oncho, the guy in the
back, got in the front,


12
0:0:38,9 --> 0:0:41,32
threatened our cameramen to turn
the camera off or else.


13
0:0:41,32 --> 0:0:44,98
And then we didn't
talk that much.


14
0:0:44,98 --> 0:0:48,7
But we found out, A, he has
no sense of direction,


15
0:0:48,7 --> 0:0:49,95
which he's proud of.


16
0:0:49,95 --> 0:0:51,15
But he's also a delivery man.


17
0:0:51,15 --> 0:0:53,7
So that sort of doesn't
go together.


18
0:0:53,7 --> 0:0:55,85
And two, he lives in Nevada.


19
0:0:55,85 --> 0:0:59,7
But his parole is in Arizona,
which is where we are now,


20
0:0:59,7 --> 0:1:6,268
standing in front of the
American flag, the USA.


21
0:1:6,268 --> 0:1:7,756
MALE SPEAKER: One,
two, three, go.


22
0:1:7,756 --> 0:1:28,13



23
0:1:28,13 --> 0:1:29,731
DAVID CHOE: This is Lars.


24
0:1:29,731 --> 0:1:32,154
This is a '56--


25
0:1:32,154 --> 0:1:33,17
LARS: Pontiac.


26
0:1:33,17 --> 0:1:34,168
DAVID CHOE: Pontiac.


27
0:1:34,168 --> 0:1:38,659
He gave us a ride into
Flagstaff today.


28
0:1:38,659 --> 0:1:40,655
Why did you give us a ride?


29
0:1:40,655 --> 0:1:42,88
LARS: Oh, you look like
the friendly folk.


30
0:1:42,88 --> 0:1:43,832
DAVID CHOE: And then were
you scared at any


31
0:1:43,832 --> 0:1:44,48
point in the ride?


32
0:1:44,48 --> 0:1:45,25
LARS: Nope.


33
0:1:45,25 --> 0:1:48,507
DAVID CHOE: Even when we
were doing funny stuff?


34
0:1:48,507 --> 0:1:49,501
LARS: Nope.


35
0:1:49,501 --> 0:1:50,0
DAVID CHOE: OK.


36
0:1:50,0 --> 0:1:51,3
All right.


37
0:1:51,3 --> 0:1:52,6
I guess he wasn't scared.


38
0:1:52,6 --> 0:1:54,49
And I guess he was nice enough
to give us a ride.


39
0:1:54,49 --> 0:1:55,7
Thank you.


40
0:1:55,7 --> 0:1:56,552
We appreciate it.


41
0:1:56,552 --> 0:1:57,802
LARS: You're welcome.


42
0:1:57,802 --> 0:2:3,468



43
0:2:3,468 --> 0:2:4,259
DAVID CHOE: This is day four.


44
0:2:4,259 --> 0:2:5,77
We're at Flagstaff, Arizona.


45
0:2:5,77 --> 0:2:9,52
We got into some small town
in Arizona last night.


46
0:2:9,52 --> 0:2:11,88
And it was dark already.


47
0:2:11,88 --> 0:2:13,31
So we had a really tough
time getting out.


48
0:2:13,31 --> 0:2:15,39
We were standing out there
for quite a bit.


49
0:2:15,39 --> 0:2:16,46
We made a sign.


50
0:2:16,46 --> 0:2:19,25
We couldn't find too
much cardboard.


51
0:2:19,25 --> 0:2:22,82
Had no luck with our
Flagstaff sign.


52
0:2:22,82 --> 0:2:26,546
And on offense to
our gay viewers.


53
0:2:26,546 --> 0:2:35,67
But the second I made this
adjustment, we got picked up


54
0:2:35,67 --> 0:2:38,132
immediately in about
30 seconds.


55
0:2:38,132 --> 0:2:40,96
I don't think the last
one was gay.


56
0:2:40,96 --> 0:2:40,587
Yeah.


57
0:2:40,587 --> 0:2:42,6
I don't think he even
noticed the sign.


58
0:2:42,6 --> 0:2:45,6
But just one of those things
that went that way.


59
0:2:45,6 --> 0:2:47,48
So this sign's pretty
useless now.


60
0:2:47,48 --> 0:2:50,35
We're in Flagstaff now,
where I guess a lot of


61
0:2:50,35 --> 0:2:52,332
hippies live here.


62
0:2:52,332 --> 0:2:55,72
And the locals here don't
really like them.


63
0:2:55,72 --> 0:2:58,14
They call them treehuggers.


64
0:2:58,14 --> 0:3:3,464
I don't know if we're going
to catch a train out


65
0:3:3,464 --> 0:3:6,6
or hop out of here.


66
0:3:6,6 --> 0:3:10,24
Yesterday was a little tough.


67
0:3:10,24 --> 0:3:14,916
You see those dudes over there
by the porta potty by the


68
0:3:14,916 --> 0:3:15,28
train tracks.


69
0:3:15,28 --> 0:3:17,716
So I think we're going
to go talk to them.


70
0:3:17,716 --> 0:3:18,54
Hi.


71
0:3:18,54 --> 0:3:23,46
So it looks like we have kindred
spirits along the side


72
0:3:23,46 --> 0:3:24,525
of the road here.


73
0:3:24,525 --> 0:3:25,88
We got fellow travelers.


74
0:3:25,88 --> 0:3:27,468
You guys--


75
0:3:27,468 --> 0:3:28,68
TOBY: We're from Canada.


76
0:3:28,68 --> 0:3:29,99
DAVID CHOE: They're Canadians.


77
0:3:29,99 --> 0:3:30,26
TOBY: Montreal.


78
0:3:30,26 --> 0:3:30,53
[INAUDIBLE]


79
0:3:30,53 --> 0:3:32,3
ROXANE: We came from Montreal.


80
0:3:32,3 --> 0:3:33,58
DAVID CHOE: Did you
guys hitchhike


81
0:3:33,58 --> 0:3:33,17
all over Canada before?


82
0:3:33,17 --> 0:3:34,17
ROXANE: No.


83
0:3:34,17 --> 0:3:34,8
TOBY: I did.


84
0:3:34,8 --> 0:3:35,13
DAVID CHOE: You did.


85
0:3:35,13 --> 0:3:36,83
TOBY: Not all over.


86
0:3:36,83 --> 0:3:37,59
But I did few province.


87
0:3:37,59 --> 0:3:38,902
DAVID CHOE: And now that you're
hitchhiking with a


88
0:3:38,902 --> 0:3:41,9
woman, do you get
rides faster?


89
0:3:41,9 --> 0:3:43,44
TOBY: Yeah, I think so.


90
0:3:43,44 --> 0:3:45,67
ROXANE: Obviously.


91
0:3:45,67 --> 0:3:46,67
Oh, yeah.


92
0:3:46,67 --> 0:3:48,235
But everything's going
pretty well.


93
0:3:48,235 --> 0:3:50,26
TOBY: And you know what
that was crazy?


94
0:3:50,26 --> 0:3:51,63
Because we've been
in a desert.


95
0:3:51,63 --> 0:3:52,68
And we found people.


96
0:3:52,68 --> 0:3:57,56
And they gave food to us and
place to stay for free.


97
0:3:57,56 --> 0:3:59,51
And they gave to us money.


98
0:3:59,51 --> 0:4:1,39
And they had food
and everything.


99
0:4:1,39 --> 0:4:1,82
DAVID CHOE: Wow.


100
0:4:1,82 --> 0:4:2,68
They were nice?


101
0:4:2,68 --> 0:4:3,2
ROXANE: Oh, yeah.


102
0:4:3,2 --> 0:4:4,4
TOBY: They were all nice.


103
0:4:4,4 --> 0:4:6,22
I was scared to be hitchhiking
in USA.


104
0:4:6,22 --> 0:4:7,56
Because it's not our country.


105
0:4:7,56 --> 0:4:7,69
ROXANE: Yeah.


106
0:4:7,69 --> 0:4:10,215
TOBY: And I was like maybe
we will get problem.


107
0:4:10,215 --> 0:4:11,4
But you know, life is good.


108
0:4:11,4 --> 0:4:14,27
And there is an angel somewhere
in the sky for us.


109
0:4:14,27 --> 0:4:15,33
ROXANE: Oh, yeah.


110
0:4:15,33 --> 0:4:15,74
Yeah.


111
0:4:15,74 --> 0:4:16,916
He helps us.


112
0:4:16,916 --> 0:4:17,394
TOBY: Yeah.


113
0:4:17,394 --> 0:4:18,829
DAVID CHOE: That's
the road angel.


114
0:4:18,829 --> 0:4:19,49
ROXANE: Yeah.


115
0:4:19,49 --> 0:4:21,294
DAVID CHOE: How long has
it been since you left?


116
0:4:21,294 --> 0:4:22,196
TOBY: Pardon?


117
0:4:22,196 --> 0:4:24,0
DAVID CHOE: How long has it been
since you left your home?


118
0:4:24,0 --> 0:4:24,471
ROXANE: One year.


119
0:4:24,471 --> 0:4:24,942
TOBY: [INAUDIBLE]


120
0:4:24,942 --> 0:4:26,826
Yeah, I left before July.


121
0:4:26,826 --> 0:4:28,8
DAVID CHOE: What's the plan?


122
0:4:28,8 --> 0:4:29,2
Where are you guys going?


123
0:4:29,2 --> 0:4:30,7
How far and long
are you going?


124
0:4:30,7 --> 0:4:30,17
ROXANE: We don't know.


125
0:4:30,17 --> 0:4:30,45
TOBY: We don't know.


126
0:4:30,45 --> 0:4:31,28
We have to get to Montreal.


127
0:4:31,28 --> 0:4:31,595
ROXANE: Yeah.


128
0:4:31,595 --> 0:4:32,88
TOBY: And we don't have
a lot of money.


129
0:4:32,88 --> 0:4:33,29
So it should--


130
0:4:33,29 --> 0:4:34,84
ROXANE: I have 35
bucks til there.


131
0:4:34,84 --> 0:4:36,57
DAVID CHOE: Oh, wow.


132
0:4:36,57 --> 0:4:39,74
TOBY: We just hope that we've
going to get a ride soon and


133
0:4:39,74 --> 0:4:41,27
we're going to get home soon.


134
0:4:41,27 --> 0:4:44,743
And we're proud of
what we got here.


135
0:4:44,743 --> 0:4:45,71
ROXANE: Oh, yeah.


136
0:4:45,71 --> 0:4:46,3
Everybody is so nice.


137
0:4:46,3 --> 0:4:46,18
TOBY: Thank you for
everything.


138
0:4:46,18 --> 0:4:47,48
DAVID CHOE: Road warriors.


139
0:4:47,48 --> 0:4:48,34
ROXANE: That was a pleasure.


140
0:4:48,34 --> 0:4:49,59
DAVID CHOE: Fellow
kindred spirits.


141
0:4:49,59 --> 0:4:53,38



142
0:4:53,38 --> 0:4:55,64
DAVID CHOE: We're trying to
catch a ride off the 40 East


143
0:4:55,64 --> 0:4:58,0
to go to Albuquerque.


144
0:4:58,0 --> 0:4:59,73
I saw this spot also.


145
0:4:59,73 --> 0:5:2,5
And I thought this would be a
good spot to hitch out of.


146
0:5:2,5 --> 0:5:3,21
And then I saw you hat.


147
0:5:3,21 --> 0:5:5,27
And I said oh, there's someone
else there too.


148
0:5:5,27 --> 0:5:6,749
And you've been here since--


149
0:5:6,749 --> 0:5:8,721
DONALD: Since about eight
o'clock this morning.


150
0:5:8,721 --> 0:5:10,2
I got up at daylight.


151
0:5:10,2 --> 0:5:12,172
And then I had enough money
to get me a cup of coffee.


152
0:5:12,172 --> 0:5:13,651
Got a cup of coffee.


153
0:5:13,651 --> 0:5:14,472
And I walked up here.


154
0:5:14,472 --> 0:5:15,14
I've been here since then.


155
0:5:15,14 --> 0:5:19,24
DAVID CHOE: If you haven't
gotten a right in like eight


156
0:5:19,24 --> 0:5:22,32
hours, you move to a different
spot and you just--


157
0:5:22,32 --> 0:5:23,5
DONALD: There's no place
else to move to.


158
0:5:23,5 --> 0:5:23,98
DAVID CHOE: All right.


159
0:5:23,98 --> 0:5:25,17
DONALD: Unless you
walk a long ways.


160
0:5:25,17 --> 0:5:26,38
But that backpack--


161
0:5:26,38 --> 0:5:27,575
I don't want to walk
a long ways.


162
0:5:27,575 --> 0:5:28,4
It's heavy.


163
0:5:28,4 --> 0:5:30,2
DAVID CHOE: What's
your story then?


164
0:5:30,2 --> 0:5:31,35
Where are you trying
to get to?


165
0:5:31,35 --> 0:5:31,56
Where are you coming from?


166
0:5:31,56 --> 0:5:32,97
DONALD: I'm trying to
get to Al Paso.


167
0:5:32,97 --> 0:5:33,775
DAVID CHOE: Is there
a reason why you're


168
0:5:33,775 --> 0:5:34,6
trying to get there?


169
0:5:34,6 --> 0:5:36,179
DONALD: I stay there
every winter.


170
0:5:36,179 --> 0:5:37,157
I'm homeless.


171
0:5:37,157 --> 0:5:38,135
So I stay there during
the winter.


172
0:5:38,135 --> 0:5:39,113
Because the winter's
mild there.


173
0:5:39,113 --> 0:5:40,91
DAVID CHOE: Right.


174
0:5:40,91 --> 0:5:42,536
So you migrate towards
the temperatures.


175
0:5:42,536 --> 0:5:44,3
DONALD: Yeah.


176
0:5:44,3 --> 0:5:46,56
DAVID CHOE: And the people that
give you rides-- they're


177
0:5:46,56 --> 0:5:46,95
nice, they're mean,
they're weird?


178
0:5:46,95 --> 0:5:47,285
DONALD: Yeah.


179
0:5:47,285 --> 0:5:47,62
No.


180
0:5:47,62 --> 0:5:48,48
I get a few weird ones.


181
0:5:48,48 --> 0:5:49,47
But most of them's all nice.


182
0:5:49,47 --> 0:5:50,2
I've had no problems.


183
0:5:50,2 --> 0:5:52,146
DAVID CHOE: Can you tell us
one of the weird ones?


184
0:5:52,146 --> 0:5:56,18
DONALD: Oh, there's gays
trying to pick you up.


185
0:5:56,18 --> 0:5:58,48
Or some of them act like
they're a little drunk.


186
0:5:58,48 --> 0:5:59,877
They're just weird acting.


187
0:5:59,877 --> 0:6:0,851
DAVID CHOE: All right.


188
0:6:0,851 --> 0:6:2,799
Well, would you rather us
hitchhike behind you or in


189
0:6:2,799 --> 0:6:3,286
front of you.


190
0:6:3,286 --> 0:6:4,26
DONALD: Yeah, you
can go ahead.


191
0:6:4,26 --> 0:6:5,721
Actually, if you want to
go up there, you can.


192
0:6:5,721 --> 0:6:6,84
DAVID CHOE: Well, I mean, if we
get picked up before you,


193
0:6:6,84 --> 0:6:11,5
then I'll for sure tell them to
pick you up also, you know?


194
0:6:11,5 --> 0:6:14,2
So out of respect, we're letting
grandpa take the prime


195
0:6:14,2 --> 0:6:15,82
real estate hitchhiking spot.


196
0:6:15,82 --> 0:6:18,44
We were sort of assholes and
we're trying to cut them off


197
0:6:18,44 --> 0:6:21,2
at the pass and try to
get a ride earlier.


198
0:6:21,2 --> 0:6:22,51
But if we get a ride, of
course, he'll give


199
0:6:22,51 --> 0:6:23,8
grandpa a ride too.


200
0:6:23,8 --> 0:6:25,8
It looks like he just
almost got a ride.


201
0:6:25,8 --> 0:6:27,42
But then I guess they weren't
going where he's going.


202
0:6:27,42 --> 0:6:29,5
So he's back out over there.


203
0:6:29,5 --> 0:6:31,26
But I like our anywhere
but here sign.


204
0:6:31,26 --> 0:6:33,42
Because Flagstaff is--


205
0:6:33,42 --> 0:6:34,55
it's no good here.


206
0:6:34,55 --> 0:6:35,8
It's bad mojo.


207
0:6:35,8 --> 0:6:44,55



208
0:6:44,55 --> 0:6:47,66
We're trying to catch a ride
off the 40 East to go into


209
0:6:47,66 --> 0:6:49,7
Albuquerque.


210
0:6:49,7 --> 0:6:51,115
Because Flagstaff is--


211
0:6:51,115 --> 0:6:53,55
it's no good here.


212
0:6:53,55 --> 0:6:57,42
It's bad mojo.


213
0:6:57,42 --> 0:6:58,28
Thanks for picking us up.


214
0:6:58,28 --> 0:6:59,45
I appreciate it.


215
0:6:59,45 --> 0:6:59,91
WAYLON: Yeah, yeah.


216
0:6:59,91 --> 0:7:0,83
No problem at all.


217
0:7:0,83 --> 0:7:1,13
[INAUDIBLE]


218
0:7:1,13 --> 0:7:1,77
DAVID CHOE: Jump on in.


219
0:7:1,77 --> 0:7:2,33
I told you we'd get--


220
0:7:2,33 --> 0:7:2,98
DONALD: Could you throw this
back there for me?


221
0:7:2,98 --> 0:7:3,25
DAVID CHOE: OK, yeah.


222
0:7:3,25 --> 0:7:5,594
We'll throw it back there.


223
0:7:5,594 --> 0:7:6,59
WAYLON: All right.


224
0:7:6,59 --> 0:7:8,582
One big happy family.


225
0:7:8,582 --> 0:7:9,8
What's up?


226
0:7:9,8 --> 0:7:9,715
DAVID CHOE: It's awesome.


227
0:7:9,715 --> 0:7:11,11
WAYLON: Look at this.


228
0:7:11,11 --> 0:7:12,505
Wow, boy.


229
0:7:12,505 --> 0:7:15,18
I dropped off one guy in
town here in Flag.


230
0:7:15,18 --> 0:7:16,59
Just picked up four more.


231
0:7:16,59 --> 0:7:17,6
How about it?


232
0:7:17,6 --> 0:7:17,68
DAVID CHOE: That's awesome.


233
0:7:17,68 --> 0:7:19,78
WAYLON: So what do you guys
got going on, you know?


234
0:7:19,78 --> 0:7:21,91
DAVID CHOE: We're just trying
to get as far as we


235
0:7:21,91 --> 0:7:22,99
can get, you know.


236
0:7:22,99 --> 0:7:25,81
WAYLON: Well I'm going to make
it as far as Atlanta.


237
0:7:25,81 --> 0:7:26,45
DAVID CHOE: Are you really?


238
0:7:26,45 --> 0:7:27,38
WAYLON: Yeah.


239
0:7:27,38 --> 0:7:31,593
So you guys are pretty styling
as far as rides go if you guys


240
0:7:31,593 --> 0:7:32,45
are into it?


241
0:7:32,45 --> 0:7:34,29
DAVID CHOE: Well
that's awesome.


242
0:7:34,29 --> 0:7:37,453
But we're trying to get as many


243
0:7:37,453 --> 0:7:39,36
different rides as possible.


244
0:7:39,36 --> 0:7:39,85
WAYLON: Really?


245
0:7:39,85 --> 0:7:40,76
That's sick.


246
0:7:40,76 --> 0:7:42,63
So how far are guys going
to rip with me then?


247
0:7:42,63 --> 0:7:43,995
Until I get boring or what?


248
0:7:43,995 --> 0:7:46,16
DAVID CHOE: No, no, no.


249
0:7:46,16 --> 0:7:46,58
It's not that.


250
0:7:46,58 --> 0:7:48,625
We just want to stop
in every state.


251
0:7:48,625 --> 0:7:51,0
WAYLON: You guys are
hitching masters.


252
0:7:51,0 --> 0:7:52,9
Check you guys out.


253
0:7:52,9 --> 0:7:53,99
DAVID CHOE: Can you tell
us a little bit like


254
0:7:53,99 --> 0:7:54,71
what your story is?


255
0:7:54,71 --> 0:7:56,55
Like have you hitchhiked
before?


256
0:7:56,55 --> 0:7:58,17
Obviously you've picked
up hitchhikers.


257
0:7:58,17 --> 0:7:59,922
WAYLON: Oh, yeah, yeah.


258
0:7:59,922 --> 0:8:2,64
Yeah, I've hitched quite a bit,
man Yeah, on the East


259
0:8:2,64 --> 0:8:4,828
coast and on the West coast.


260
0:8:4,828 --> 0:8:7,188
It's not so bad on
the West coast.


261
0:8:7,188 --> 0:8:10,56
But I think they made a lot of
movies back in the late '80s


262
0:8:10,56 --> 0:8:11,78
about hitchhikers
killing people.


263
0:8:11,78 --> 0:8:12,68
DAVID CHOE: Right.


264
0:8:12,68 --> 0:8:15,24
WAYLON: So everybody's scared to
death, not to mention that


265
0:8:15,24 --> 0:8:17,321
the media's got everybody so
scared shitless of each


266
0:8:17,321 --> 0:8:21,15
other's shadows these days that
nobody wants to pick up


267
0:8:21,15 --> 0:8:22,75
anybody for jack.


268
0:8:22,75 --> 0:8:24,83
DAVID CHOE: That's the same
feeling I get is just sometime


269
0:8:24,83 --> 0:8:26,99
during the '80s, like two or
three people got killed.


270
0:8:26,99 --> 0:8:29,29
But people forget that, like,
everyone used to hitchhike and


271
0:8:29,29 --> 0:8:30,15
everyone used to give rides.


272
0:8:30,15 --> 0:8:30,965
And it was no problem.


273
0:8:30,965 --> 0:8:31,29
WAYLON: Yeah.


274
0:8:31,29 --> 0:8:34,7
DAVID CHOE: And then they blow
something out of proportion.


275
0:8:34,7 --> 0:8:35,44
And I've hitchhiked for years.


276
0:8:35,44 --> 0:8:37,61
And I've never really
had any major--


277
0:8:37,61 --> 0:8:38,555
you get picked up by weirdos.


278
0:8:38,555 --> 0:8:39,105
But nothing--


279
0:8:39,105 --> 0:8:40,32
you know.


280
0:8:40,32 --> 0:8:42,72
If you're out of luck
and you need a ride,


281
0:8:42,72 --> 0:8:44,55
it's nice, you know.


282
0:8:44,55 --> 0:8:45,95
HARRY KIM: This is Donald.


283
0:8:45,95 --> 0:8:48,63
And he's been telling me about
how for the last four years


284
0:8:48,63 --> 0:8:49,44
he's been homeless.


285
0:8:49,44 --> 0:8:51,75
So he's kind of become
like a US traveler.


286
0:8:51,75 --> 0:8:53,14
DONALD: The thing about
homeless, you know--


287
0:8:53,14 --> 0:8:55,198
there's a lot of you
get broke, and


288
0:8:55,198 --> 0:8:56,56
you get a hard time.


289
0:8:56,56 --> 0:8:57,8
But life's full of hard
times anyhow.


290
0:8:57,8 --> 0:8:59,0
You've got go through bad.


291
0:8:59,0 --> 0:9:1,1
You have good times, all that.


292
0:9:1,1 --> 0:9:4,458
But in a way, I'm free.


293
0:9:4,458 --> 0:9:7,24
Because I don't have to worry
about nothing really, just


294
0:9:7,24 --> 0:9:10,5
surviving, on being alive.


295
0:9:10,5 --> 0:9:12,13
DAVID CHOE: Where's
home base for you?


296
0:9:12,13 --> 0:9:13,17
WAYLON: Right here, my man.


297
0:9:13,17 --> 0:9:13,9
DAVID CHOE: Oh, you're from--


298
0:9:13,9 --> 0:9:15,16
WAYLON: You're right.


299
0:9:15,16 --> 0:9:16,544
DAVID CHOE: You're
from Flagstaff?


300
0:9:16,544 --> 0:9:16,946
WAYLON: No.


301
0:9:16,946 --> 0:9:19,681
I'm from my Dolphin
right here.


302
0:9:19,681 --> 0:9:20,603
I'm from the RV.


303
0:9:20,603 --> 0:9:21,64
DAVID CHOE: Oh, this is is?


304
0:9:21,64 --> 0:9:21,99
WAYLON: Yeah, man.


305
0:9:21,99 --> 0:9:23,9
Yeah.


306
0:9:23,9 --> 0:9:26,6
DAVID CHOE: I think everyone
that works an office job


307
0:9:26,6 --> 0:9:31,8
secretly desires exactly what
you're doing, like fucking


308
0:9:31,8 --> 0:9:32,3
jump in your car.


309
0:9:32,3 --> 0:9:32,25
Get your dog.


310
0:9:32,25 --> 0:9:33,91
WAYLON: Yeah.


311
0:9:33,91 --> 0:9:35,0
DAVID CHOE: Live from
place to place.


312
0:9:35,0 --> 0:9:36,74
Where you lay your head
is home, just go.


313
0:9:36,74 --> 0:9:39,73
Wherever you go, new adventures,
new things.


314
0:9:39,73 --> 0:9:41,695
WAYLON: You know, everybody
wants a van.


315
0:9:41,695 --> 0:9:44,605
But there's fewer and fewer
people who are willing to do


316
0:9:44,605 --> 0:9:48,485
what it takes or to succeed
at their dream and live a


317
0:9:48,485 --> 0:9:50,425
fulfilled life, man.


318
0:9:50,425 --> 0:9:52,57
So I'm just trying to take
advantage of my life is all--


319
0:9:52,57 --> 0:9:53,9
DAVID CHOE: Right.


320
0:9:53,9 --> 0:9:55,21
WAYLON: Not take it for granted
and appreciate this


321
0:9:55,21 --> 0:9:57,202
beautiful gift we call life.


322
0:9:57,202 --> 0:9:58,2
DAVID CHOE: Right.


323
0:9:58,2 --> 0:10:0,4
WAYLON: So other than that,
my man, that's about it.


324
0:10:0,4 --> 0:10:1,57
I worked for a while,
saved up some money.


325
0:10:1,57 --> 0:10:5,41
And I'm just doing my thing.


326
0:10:5,41 --> 0:10:6,41
DAVID CHOE: Was it a girl?


327
0:10:6,41 --> 0:10:7,77
WAYLON: Just kind of
creating my scene.


328
0:10:7,77 --> 0:10:8,17
What's that?


329
0:10:8,17 --> 0:10:9,3
DAVID CHOE: Was it a girl?


330
0:10:9,3 --> 0:10:10,19
WAYLON: Oh, this is the
only girl for me


331
0:10:10,19 --> 0:10:11,76
right here, this Angus.


332
0:10:11,76 --> 0:10:15,77



333
0:10:15,77 --> 0:10:16,705
DAVID CHOE: This guy
is like basically


334
0:10:16,705 --> 0:10:18,27
the hitchhiking paradise.


335
0:10:18,27 --> 0:10:20,6
He picks up everyone.


336
0:10:20,6 --> 0:10:22,82
He's living in the present.


337
0:10:22,82 --> 0:10:25,32
Basically, our entire trip
can end right here.


338
0:10:25,32 --> 0:10:26,57
He basically offered
us a ride to the


339
0:10:26,57 --> 0:10:27,32
other side of the country.


340
0:10:27,32 --> 0:10:29,47
So we'll see if we do that.


341
0:10:29,47 --> 0:10:32,91
We have another guy down here
that we're going to pick up.


342
0:10:32,91 --> 0:10:34,12
So it's still a sausage
fest right now.


343
0:10:34,12 --> 0:10:36,81
But we'll see how it goes.


344
0:10:36,81 --> 0:10:38,44
Is he holding a dog?


345
0:10:38,44 --> 0:10:39,434
HARRY KIM: I'm Harry.


346
0:10:39,434 --> 0:10:40,428
DAVID CHOE: David


347
0:10:40,428 --> 0:10:41,919
MALE SPEAKER: Nice
to meet you.


348
0:10:41,919 --> 0:10:42,913
Where are you from?


349
0:10:42,913 --> 0:10:43,41
Where are you headed?


350
0:10:43,41 --> 0:10:43,907
DAVID CHOE: Greenbay.


351
0:10:43,907 --> 0:10:44,404
MALE SPEAKER: Greenbay?


352
0:10:44,404 --> 0:10:45,398
DAVID CHOE: Yeah.


353
0:10:45,398 --> 0:10:46,889
WAYLON: So who's
driving, y'all?


354
0:10:46,889 --> 0:10:47,883
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]


355
0:10:47,883 --> 0:10:48,38
WAYLON: Hey, brother.


356
0:10:48,38 --> 0:10:49,871
DAVID CHOE: Do you know
how to drive stick?


357
0:10:49,871 --> 0:10:50,865
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


358
0:10:50,865 --> 0:10:51,362
DAVID CHOE: Do you
want to drive?


359
0:10:51,362 --> 0:10:52,356
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.


360
0:10:52,356 --> 0:10:53,35
DAVID CHOE: OK, cool.


361
0:10:53,35 --> 0:10:54,344
WAYLON: Ah, poor boys.


362
0:10:54,344 --> 0:10:56,332
Wake me up in Saint Louis.


363
0:10:56,332 --> 0:11:14,721



364
0:11:14,721 --> 0:11:17,206
DAVID CHOE: Calling all lost
souls seems to be the


365
0:11:17,206 --> 0:11:19,26
theme of this one.


366
0:11:19,26 --> 0:11:20,99
We're going to ride
on the Dolphin.


367
0:11:20,99 --> 0:11:24,75
It's like the Noah's
Arc of hitchhikers.


368
0:11:24,75 --> 0:11:29,9
We picked up two guys
and two dogs also.


369
0:11:29,9 --> 0:11:32,66
So total, there's five
hitchhikers on there and one


370
0:11:32,66 --> 0:11:35,58
awesome guy named Waylon,
kindred spirits.


371
0:11:35,58 --> 0:11:36,28
Just picked us up.


372
0:11:36,28 --> 0:11:37,5
Picks up all hitchhikers.


373
0:11:37,5 --> 0:11:40,67
He doesn't care if they're
carrying a trash bag full of


374
0:11:40,67 --> 0:11:42,115
french fries or smell
like shit.


375
0:11:42,115 --> 0:11:44,43
He'll pick anywhere up.


376
0:11:44,43 --> 0:11:46,1
And weed seems to be the common


377
0:11:46,1 --> 0:11:50,14
theme of all the travelers.


378
0:11:50,14 --> 0:11:52,92
Grandpa here has a huge weed
tattoo on his arm.


379
0:11:52,92 --> 0:11:53,64
The other fellow--


380
0:11:53,64 --> 0:11:54,74
I forgot his name--


381
0:11:54,74 --> 0:11:55,79
was stranded on the street.


382
0:11:55,79 --> 0:11:58,6
Because he had a weed deal with
his cousin that went bad.


383
0:11:58,6 --> 0:12:1,17
So his cousin had a hissy fit
and then threw him out.


384
0:12:1,17 --> 0:12:4,34
And then Waylon, who actually
enjoys weed, but then doesn't


385
0:12:4,34 --> 0:12:5,22
smoke it anymore.


386
0:12:5,22 --> 0:12:8,61
He's got his own spiritual
dilemma going on right now.


387
0:12:8,61 --> 0:12:10,15
And all around, good guys.


388
0:12:10,15 --> 0:12:14,9



389
0:12:14,9 --> 0:12:17,2
So we're 60 miles outside of
Albuquerque and our longest


390
0:12:17,2 --> 0:12:19,2
ride so far.


391
0:12:19,2 --> 0:12:20,44
In four days, we've
gone through


392
0:12:20,44 --> 0:12:24,85
California, Nevada, Arizona.


393
0:12:24,85 --> 0:12:27,83
And now we're in New Mexico,
in a place called Moriarty.


394
0:12:27,83 --> 0:12:28,11
And it was funny.


395
0:12:28,11 --> 0:12:30,75
Because the guy that picked us
up and one of the other guys


396
0:12:30,75 --> 0:12:31,77
that we picked up--


397
0:12:31,77 --> 0:12:33,312
we're all of 30.


398
0:12:33,312 --> 0:12:35,378
Those two guys still--


399
0:12:35,378 --> 0:12:37,354
they're wandering souls.


400
0:12:37,354 --> 0:12:40,318
But they still live at home
with their parents.


401
0:12:40,318 --> 0:12:44,45
And besides weed and
drywalling, they


402
0:12:44,45 --> 0:12:46,79
all had funny tattoos.


403
0:12:46,79 --> 0:12:48,8
Great guys though,
really cool guys.


404
0:12:48,8 --> 0:12:50,58
It's about midnight right now.


405
0:12:50,58 --> 0:12:51,98
And we're at the truck stop.


406
0:12:51,98 --> 0:12:55,63
So we'll see what this
own has to offer.


407
0:12:55,63 --> 0:12:56,88
Thumbs up.


408
0:12:56,88 --> 0:13:2,1



409
0:13:2,1 --> 0:13:2,27
All right.


410
0:13:2,27 --> 0:13:2,79
This is David Choe.


411
0:13:2,79 --> 0:13:4,78
And this is Thumbs Up.


412
0:13:4,78 --> 0:13:7,97
This is day five
on our journey.


413
0:13:7,97 --> 0:13:10,81
We are still in New Mexico.


414
0:13:10,81 --> 0:13:12,61
Yesterday we rode
for 12 hours.


415
0:13:12,61 --> 0:13:15,75
We got a ride with a nice fellow
named Waylon Powers.


416
0:13:15,75 --> 0:13:17,465
And then we picked up grandpa.


417
0:13:17,465 --> 0:13:18,92
And then we also picked up--


418
0:13:18,92 --> 0:13:19,71
I can't remember his name.


419
0:13:19,71 --> 0:13:22,5
Strong, silent type, looked
like Paul Newman.


420
0:13:22,5 --> 0:13:25,4
Paul Newman didn't say much for
most of the ride unless it


421
0:13:25,4 --> 0:13:25,7
had anything to do with


422
0:13:25,7 --> 0:13:27,5
construction work or dry walling.


423
0:13:27,5 --> 0:13:31,42
And then all of a sudden out of
nowhere comes out with, I


424
0:13:31,42 --> 0:13:34,23
think I tend to fall in love
really easily if the pussy's


425
0:13:34,23 --> 0:13:35,33
really good.


426
0:13:35,33 --> 0:13:39,6
Where Waylon comes
in with, on, man.


427
0:13:39,6 --> 0:13:40,91
It's just a box, man.


428
0:13:40,91 --> 0:13:42,71
It's just a box.


429
0:13:42,71 --> 0:13:45,43
You got to deny yourself
the box, man.


430
0:13:45,43 --> 0:13:48,7
Deny yourself the weed, the
beer, and the pussy.


431
0:13:48,7 --> 0:13:51,2
And that's how you
empower yourself.


432
0:13:51,2 --> 0:13:54,36
I guess we all had that in
common is that we all tend to


433
0:13:54,36 --> 0:13:56,923
fall in love with the box, fall
in love with the pussy if


434
0:13:56,923 --> 0:13:57,34
it's really good.


435
0:13:57,34 --> 0:13:59,35
I guess I don't know if
that's love or not.


436
0:13:59,35 --> 0:14:1,87
But that was that.


437
0:14:1,87 --> 0:14:3,61
So we're going to try to
get to Texas today.


438
0:14:3,61 --> 0:14:6,46



439
0:14:6,46 --> 0:14:8,15
So, hi.


440
0:14:8,15 --> 0:14:11,1
We're in the town of Moriarty.


441
0:14:11,1 --> 0:14:12,78
And this is in--


442
0:14:12,78 --> 0:14:13,365
VANESSA: New Mexico.


443
0:14:13,365 --> 0:14:13,66
BUBBA: New Mexico.


444
0:14:13,66 --> 0:14:14,5
DAVID CHOE: New Mexico.


445
0:14:14,5 --> 0:14:17,4
Everyone introduce yourselves.


446
0:14:17,4 --> 0:14:18,21
BUBBA: I'm Bubba.


447
0:14:18,21 --> 0:14:19,57
DAVID CHOE: That's Bubba.


448
0:14:19,57 --> 0:14:20,28
VANESSA: I'm Vanessa.


449
0:14:20,28 --> 0:14:21,45
DAVID CHOE: Vanessa.


450
0:14:21,45 --> 0:14:23,4
SUSIE: I'm Susie.


451
0:14:23,4 --> 0:14:24,36
CHRIS: I'm Chris


452
0:14:24,36 --> 0:14:25,43
PUMPKIN: Pumpkin.


453
0:14:25,43 --> 0:14:27,4
AMANDA: Amanda.


454
0:14:27,4 --> 0:14:28,92
DAVID CHOE: So you guys want to
tell us a little bit about


455
0:14:28,92 --> 0:14:30,6
this town and what
goes on here?


456
0:14:30,6 --> 0:14:31,965
BUBBA: It's very small.


457
0:14:31,965 --> 0:14:32,84
There's a lot of drinking.


458
0:14:32,84 --> 0:14:33,71
DAVID CHOE: A lot of drinking.


459
0:14:33,71 --> 0:14:35,9
Oh, everyone's waiting
for the liquor


460
0:14:35,9 --> 0:14:35,78
store to open on Sunday.


461
0:14:35,78 --> 0:14:36,13
CHRIS: Yeah.


462
0:14:36,13 --> 0:14:37,5
BUBBA: Yeah.


463
0:14:37,5 --> 0:14:38,26
How many minutes?


464
0:14:38,26 --> 0:14:39,1
Those open.


465
0:14:39,1 --> 0:14:40,42
SUSIE: The average age
in Moriarty to start


466
0:14:40,42 --> 0:14:42,75
drinking is like six.


467
0:14:42,75 --> 0:14:44,866
DAVID CHOE: What's the
population here?


468
0:14:44,866 --> 0:14:47,196
SUSIE: No, about 2,200
right now.


469
0:14:47,196 --> 0:14:47,59
DAVID CHOE: All right.


470
0:14:47,59 --> 0:14:50,45
Were you guys all born and
raised in this town?


471
0:14:50,45 --> 0:14:51,15
PUMPKIN: Fuck, no.


472
0:14:51,15 --> 0:14:52,47
AMANDA: No.


473
0:14:52,47 --> 0:14:53,75
PUMPKIN: You're fucking funny.


474
0:14:53,75 --> 0:14:56,16
DAVID CHOE: Texas?


475
0:14:56,16 --> 0:14:58,75
SUSIE: Texas, yeah,
born and bred.


476
0:14:58,75 --> 0:14:59,95
DAVID CHOE: Which city?


477
0:14:59,95 --> 0:15:1,19
SUSIE: These two were
born in Albuquerque.


478
0:15:1,19 --> 0:15:3,43
He was born in Florida.


479
0:15:3,43 --> 0:15:4,65
I don't know where
he was born at.


480
0:15:4,65 --> 0:15:7,118
PUMPKIN: I was born in hell.


481
0:15:7,118 --> 0:15:8,28
SUSIE: No.


482
0:15:8,28 --> 0:15:10,41
DAVID CHOE: So you guys seem to
come from various parts of


483
0:15:10,41 --> 0:15:13,55
purgatory, hell, and other
parts of the South.


484
0:15:13,55 --> 0:15:16,35
What brought you guys to--


485
0:15:16,35 --> 0:15:17,36
SUSIE: These are my two
daughters and my two


486
0:15:17,36 --> 0:15:17,65
son-in-laws.


487
0:15:17,65 --> 0:15:19,0
DAVID CHOE: Oh.


488
0:15:19,0 --> 0:15:21,7
SUSIE: And my husband.


489
0:15:21,7 --> 0:15:22,78
DAVID CHOE: And so why did
you guys pick this town?


490
0:15:22,78 --> 0:15:23,47
SUSIE: Because we hate
Albuquerque.


491
0:15:23,47 --> 0:15:25,173
AMANDA: New Mexico sucks.


492
0:15:25,173 --> 0:15:26,37
Because Texas is better.


493
0:15:26,37 --> 0:15:27,43
BUBBA: Texas is better, man.


494
0:15:27,43 --> 0:15:28,26
DAVID CHOE: God bless Texas.


495
0:15:28,26 --> 0:15:28,7
SUSIE: This is what one is.


496
0:15:28,7 --> 0:15:29,19
We were out here.


497
0:15:29,19 --> 0:15:30,695
We were looking for land.


498
0:15:30,695 --> 0:15:32,362
And we were looking in Berlin
and all that stuff, and


499
0:15:32,362 --> 0:15:32,94
looking for land out here.


500
0:15:32,94 --> 0:15:35,77
We came out here on his
Harley, no less, huh?


501
0:15:35,77 --> 0:15:38,5
And a 10-year-old boy held the
door open for me and stood


502
0:15:38,5 --> 0:15:40,7
there and said yes,
ma'am, no, ma'am.


503
0:15:40,7 --> 0:15:42,49
And I was like well, this
is where we're moving.


504
0:15:42,49 --> 0:15:43,18
DAVID CHOE: Just like that.


505
0:15:43,18 --> 0:15:44,36
SUSIE: Just like that.


506
0:15:44,36 --> 0:15:46,49
DAVID CHOE: So you guys all
drink together as a family.


507
0:15:46,49 --> 0:15:46,8
AMANDA: I don't know


508
0:15:46,8 --> 0:15:46,97
PUMPKIN: I do.


509
0:15:46,97 --> 0:15:49,871
I've never touched a drop
of alcohol in my life.


510
0:15:49,871 --> 0:15:50,74
SUSIE: The girls can't drink.


511
0:15:50,74 --> 0:15:52,25
Because they're both
expecting.


512
0:15:52,25 --> 0:15:52,735
DAVID CHOE: Are you really?


513
0:15:52,735 --> 0:15:53,59
BUBBA: Yeah.


514
0:15:53,59 --> 0:15:53,93
DAVID CHOE: Oh, wow.


515
0:15:53,93 --> 0:15:55,22
Congratulations.


516
0:15:55,22 --> 0:15:57,7
PUMPKIN: They call me Pumpkin
for one reason.


517
0:15:57,7 --> 0:15:59,795
Because I was born in McCaws's
pumpkin patch, lost it at


518
0:15:59,795 --> 0:16:1,585
McCale's motherfucking farm.


519
0:16:1,585 --> 0:16:3,705
This is why they call
me Pumpkin.


520
0:16:3,705 --> 0:16:7,21
Because I roam with the wicked
shit, here and everybody else,


521
0:16:7,21 --> 0:16:9,2
feeling nothing but
that acid trip.


522
0:16:9,2 --> 0:16:9,67
Don't give a fuck.


523
0:16:9,67 --> 0:16:10,86
Water fall down, all around.


524
0:16:10,86 --> 0:16:13,995
Motherfucker, UCWC represent
wicked clown.


525
0:16:13,995 --> 0:16:14,84
Slit your throat.


526
0:16:14,84 --> 0:16:15,666
Watch you die.


527
0:16:15,666 --> 0:16:17,95
Motherfucker, I hope
you croak.


528
0:16:17,95 --> 0:16:19,26
Don't give a fuck on how
many motherfuckers you


529
0:16:19,26 --> 0:16:20,175
want to try to fool.


530
0:16:20,175 --> 0:16:21,12
Because I hit 'em bad.


531
0:16:21,12 --> 0:16:23,54
Beat you down, motherfucking
50 in my hand.


532
0:16:23,54 --> 0:16:24,47
Be eternally fucking glad.


533
0:16:24,47 --> 0:16:25,38
Don't give a shit.


534
0:16:25,38 --> 0:16:26,402
Slit your throat.


535
0:16:26,402 --> 0:16:26,94
Watch you fucking die.


536
0:16:26,94 --> 0:16:29,995
Don't give a shit, smoking
this J, send out your


537
0:16:29,995 --> 0:16:31,35
motherfucking heart.


538
0:16:31,35 --> 0:16:32,96
Beat your ass all around.


539
0:16:32,96 --> 0:16:34,1
Smoking all that grass.


540
0:16:34,1 --> 0:16:35,28
Because I am the wicked shit.


541
0:16:35,28 --> 0:16:38,76
Remember that all about when
you hit this fucking blast.


542
0:16:38,76 --> 0:16:39,495
DAVID CHOE: Wow.


543
0:16:39,495 --> 0:16:43,29
Wow, amazing.


544
0:16:43,29 --> 0:16:44,68
You guys start early.


545
0:16:44,68 --> 0:16:45,34
BUBBA: Yep.


546
0:16:45,34 --> 0:16:46,834
CHRIS: Why not?


547
0:16:46,834 --> 0:16:48,9
VANESSA: [INAUDIBLE] early.


548
0:16:48,9 --> 0:16:48,5
BUBBA: No.


549
0:16:48,5 --> 0:16:49,38
You go to El Paso.


550
0:16:49,38 --> 0:16:51,35
They start at like three
in the morning.


551
0:16:51,35 --> 0:16:51,72
DAVID CHOE: Wait.


552
0:16:51,72 --> 0:16:55,34
So you guys are smashed by,
like, two in the afternoon.


553
0:16:55,34 --> 0:16:56,23
SUSIE: There's only two of
us that get smashed--


554
0:16:56,23 --> 0:16:57,25
him and him.


555
0:16:57,25 --> 0:16:59,312
DAVID CHOE: And none of this
leads to violence.


556
0:16:59,312 --> 0:16:59,734
VANESSA: Nope.


557
0:16:59,734 --> 0:17:1,0
SUSIE: No.


558
0:17:1,0 --> 0:17:1,86
PUMPKIN: No.


559
0:17:1,86 --> 0:17:1,99
I do got a lot of
misdemeanors.


560
0:17:1,99 --> 0:17:3,58
BUBBA: And he's not here yet.


561
0:17:3,58 --> 0:17:5,602
PUMPKIN: I do got a lot
of criminal charges.


562
0:17:5,602 --> 0:17:6,589
DAVID CHOE: But no felonies.


563
0:17:6,589 --> 0:17:7,845
PUMPKIN: No felonies.


564
0:17:7,845 --> 0:17:8,22
DAVID CHOE: That's good.


565
0:17:8,22 --> 0:17:9,42
PUMPKIN: Just a lot of
criminal charges.


566
0:17:9,42 --> 0:17:10,27
That's all.


567
0:17:10,27 --> 0:17:12,49
All misdemeanors, all
misdemeanors.


568
0:17:12,49 --> 0:17:13,736
DAVID CHOE: Well, it was
nice meeting you all.


569
0:17:13,736 --> 0:17:14,986
CHRIS: Same here.


570
0:17:14,986 --> 0:17:20,54



571
0:17:20,54 --> 0:17:22,971
DAVID CHOE: We're at a freeway
underpass right now.


572
0:17:22,971 --> 0:17:25,319
We're trying to hop out,
hopefully get into a different


573
0:17:25,319 --> 0:17:27,56
state by today.


574
0:17:27,56 --> 0:17:31,412
We have some really classic
graffiti here that I'm going


575
0:17:31,412 --> 0:17:34,31
to try to decipher for you.


576
0:17:34,31 --> 0:17:36,24
It doesn't get more
perfect than this.


577
0:17:36,24 --> 0:17:40,3
First we have the pentagram with
the six, six, six, with a


578
0:17:40,3 --> 0:17:42,83
pitchfork, a swastika, and
upside down cross.


579
0:17:42,83 --> 0:17:49,71
Here we have an abstract cow,
and then of course Metallica,


580
0:17:49,71 --> 0:17:50,34
another swastika--


581
0:17:50,34 --> 0:17:53,0
awesome job--


582
0:17:53,0 --> 0:17:56,505
hammer, white power, and the
classic graffiti S that


583
0:17:56,505 --> 0:17:59,116
everyone draws when they're
in high school.


584
0:17:59,116 --> 0:18:1,51
And I don't know if this is the
exactly how it happened.


585
0:18:1,51 --> 0:18:4,27
But this is how I imagine
it happened in my mind.


586
0:18:4,27 --> 0:18:7,68
I'm guessing white power,
white trash, gutter punk


587
0:18:7,68 --> 0:18:11,33
couple was up here getting
drunk, spray painting.


588
0:18:11,33 --> 0:18:14,4
And then those past two columns,
the male, who is


589
0:18:14,4 --> 0:18:16,28
usually more aggressive, was
painting the swastikas and the


590
0:18:16,28 --> 0:18:17,69
six, six, six.


591
0:18:17,69 --> 0:18:20,78
And his girlfriend was like I
took one of the cans and came


592
0:18:20,78 --> 0:18:23,37
over here and did the
Pac Man ghosts.


593
0:18:23,37 --> 0:18:26,69
So here's the Pac Man ghosts,
which are much more friendlier


594
0:18:26,69 --> 0:18:28,85
and more light-hearted.


595
0:18:28,85 --> 0:18:29,782
Oh my goodness.


596
0:18:29,782 --> 0:18:32,8
Look at what I found.


597
0:18:32,8 --> 0:18:33,91
I thought it couldn't get
better than this.


598
0:18:33,91 --> 0:18:39,48
A China man the only
other color--


599
0:18:39,48 --> 0:18:41,55
I mean, so for all the grafiti's
been in black, but


600
0:18:41,55 --> 0:18:43,89
they broke out the metallics
for this one.


601
0:18:43,89 --> 0:18:47,37
It's a buck tooth China man
with a coolie cap on.


602
0:18:47,37 --> 0:18:51,31
And someone crossed him out,
saying no China man, with


603
0:18:51,31 --> 0:18:52,32
silver paint.


604
0:18:52,32 --> 0:18:56,68
And right there we have,
of course, the


605
0:18:56,68 --> 0:18:57,93
classic human shit.


606
0:18:57,93 --> 0:19:22,71



607
0:19:22,71 --> 0:19:24,97
We're having a really tough
time catching out of


608
0:19:24,97 --> 0:19:25,72
this part of town.


609
0:19:25,72 --> 0:19:29,55
So we're breaking out the
instruments, who, Hasinto, our


610
0:19:29,55 --> 0:19:33,2
cameraman, has been carrying
for us this whole time.


611
0:19:33,2 --> 0:19:35,63
We're going to play our golden
medley, the one that usually


612
0:19:35,63 --> 0:19:40,7
gets us picked up, which is a
fusion of Guns n' Roses, Mr.


613
0:19:40,7 --> 0:19:44,51
Brownstone, the Police's, Every
Breath You Take, and


614
0:19:44,51 --> 0:19:47,402
whatever Led Zeppelin
songs Harry decides


615
0:19:47,402 --> 0:19:48,758
moves him at the moment.


616
0:19:48,758 --> 0:19:51,47



617
0:19:51,47 --> 0:19:51,71
HARRY KIM: [SINGING]


618
0:19:51,71 --> 0:19:52,97
Fuck New Mexico.


619
0:19:52,97 --> 0:19:57,66
Texas is better.


620
0:19:57,66 --> 0:20:1,82
Texas is better.


621
0:20:1,82 --> 0:20:2,561
Fuck New Mexico.


622
0:20:2,561 --> 0:20:16,89



623
0:20:16,89 --> 0:20:18,85
DAVID CHOE: We rocked Moriarty,
New Mexico.


624
0:20:18,85 --> 0:20:19,235
We rocked California.


625
0:20:19,235 --> 0:20:21,24
We rocked Nevada.


626
0:20:21,24 --> 0:20:24,71
Is Texas going to rock us
or will we rock Texas?


627
0:20:24,71 --> 0:20:26,49
Find out in Thumbs Up,
the next issue.


628
0:20:26,49 --> 0:20:31,38



629
0:20:31,38 --> 0:20:33,25
We're in New Mexico still.


630
0:20:33,25 --> 0:20:34,58
New Mexico, Texas.


631
0:20:34,58 --> 0:20:36,82
A lot of fucking cows.


632
0:20:36,82 --> 0:20:37,15
We're getting hungry.


633
0:20:37,15 --> 0:20:39,47
We're going to try to catch
one, try to jump on one.


634
0:20:39,47 --> 0:20:47,51



635
0:20:47,51 --> 0:20:49,6
God bless John Wayne.


636
0:20:49,6 --> 0:21:5,33



637
0:21:5,33 --> 0:21:9,31
So as the day comes to a close,
many lessons to learn.


638
0:21:9,31 --> 0:21:13,57
A, as humans, we can't
even run as fast


639
0:21:13,57 --> 0:21:16,5
as chickens or cows.


640
0:21:16,5 --> 0:21:19,17
We're in a beautiful town of
Tucumcari, New Mexico.


641
0:21:19,17 --> 0:21:23,65
We were in Moriarty, New Mexico,
earlier today, where


642
0:21:23,65 --> 0:21:26,22
we met an amazing beautiful
family.


643
0:21:26,22 --> 0:21:28,25
Well, I mean they were something
really special.


644
0:21:28,25 --> 0:21:30,98
They were beautiful
human beings.


645
0:21:30,98 --> 0:21:33,55
We learned lots of things from
them, that going to the liquor


646
0:21:33,55 --> 0:21:36,73
store in two different cars
early on a Sunday morning is a


647
0:21:36,73 --> 0:21:37,47
family affair.


648
0:21:37,47 --> 0:21:41,63
And it's great, families
sticking close together.


649
0:21:41,63 --> 0:21:46,38
We learned that if you're a 15
or 16-year-old woman that's


650
0:21:46,38 --> 0:21:48,22
pregnant, that's carrying,
that's holding,


651
0:21:48,22 --> 0:21:48,95
you shouldn't drink.


652
0:21:48,95 --> 0:21:50,29
But it's OK to smoke.


653
0:21:50,29 --> 0:21:51,96
We pretty much fucking
rocked this town.


654
0:21:51,96 --> 0:21:52,8
We came in.


655
0:21:52,8 --> 0:21:53,89
We rocked it hard.


656
0:21:53,89 --> 0:21:55,1
The chickens got rocked.


657
0:21:55,1 --> 0:21:56,36
The cows got rocked.


658
0:21:56,36 --> 0:21:58,38
The locals got rocked.


659
0:21:58,38 --> 0:22:1,58
And that's about all I have
to say about that.


660
0:22:1,58 --> 0:22:32,208



661
0:22:32,208 --> 0:22:33,458
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]


662
0:22:33,458 --> 0:22:36,12



663
0:22:36,12 --> 0:22:39,33
DAVID CHOE: That's party
is this possible.


664
0:22:39,33 --> 0:22:41,33
FEMALE SPEAKER: All right.


665
0:22:41,33 --> 0:22:42,83
DAVID CHOE: Take care, guys.


666
0:22:42,83 --> 0:22:43,27
FEMALE SPEAKER: Bye.


667
0:22:43,27 --> 0:22:44,52
MALE SPEAKER: Bye.


668
0:22:44,52 --> 0:22:46,77



669
0:22:46,77 --> 0:22:48,2
DAVID CHOE: Excuse me, sir.


670
0:22:48,2 --> 0:22:51,2



671
0:22:51,2 --> 0:22:52,25
I'm sorry to bother you.


672
0:22:52,25 --> 0:22:56,895
But me and my friend, we're the
two guys that just played


673
0:22:56,895 --> 0:22:58,205
in the bar right here.


674
0:22:58,205 --> 0:23:0,39
Do you think--


675
0:23:0,39 --> 0:23:3,255
I mean, I think we could fit.


676
0:23:3,255 --> 0:23:5,12
Do you think you could give
us a ride into Texas?


677
0:23:5,12 --> 0:23:5,68
MALE SPEAKER: To where?


678
0:23:5,68 --> 0:23:7,352
DAVID CHOE: To Texas?


679
0:23:7,352 --> 0:23:7,73
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


680
0:23:7,73 --> 0:23:8,9
[INAUDIBLE].


681
0:23:8,9 --> 0:23:9,7
DAVID CHOE: I mean,
just anywhere.


682
0:23:9,7 --> 0:23:11,911
Just we've been in
town for so long.


683
0:23:11,911 --> 0:23:14,366
We just want to get
a ride out.


684
0:23:14,366 --> 0:23:15,616
MALE SPEAKER: OK.


685
0:23:15,616 --> 0:23:36,98



686
0:23:36,98 --> 0:23:39,3
DAVID CHOE: So two
in the morning.


687
0:23:39,3 --> 0:23:42,35
We just entered Amarillo,
Texas.


688
0:23:42,35 --> 0:23:44,2
God bless Texas.


689
0:23:44,2 --> 0:23:45,47
We are in Texas.


690
0:23:45,47 --> 0:23:48,123
Things get weird in Texas.


691
0:23:48,123 --> 0:23:52,75
[BLEEP]'s one of my favorite
24 hour diners that doesn't


692
0:23:52,75 --> 0:23:54,22
exist in California.


693
0:23:54,22 --> 0:23:56,4
Surprisingly, we haven't
hit one of them


694
0:23:56,4 --> 0:23:57,33
since our whole journey.


695
0:23:57,33 --> 0:23:59,71
And this is the first
one in Texas.


696
0:23:59,71 --> 0:24:2,92
And our waitresses--


697
0:24:2,92 --> 0:24:4,65
very nice, very kind,
very shy--


698
0:24:4,65 --> 0:24:6,35
would not go on camera, As we
were paying the check, I asked


699
0:24:6,35 --> 0:24:9,47
them, because this place is
known to have the most insane


700
0:24:9,47 --> 0:24:11,65
people coming in
at all hours--


701
0:24:11,65 --> 0:24:14,7
and I just asked them who are
the worst people ever that


702
0:24:14,7 --> 0:24:14,905
come in here.


703
0:24:14,905 --> 0:24:16,55
And I thought she was going to
say drunks or something.


704
0:24:16,55 --> 0:24:19,18
All the waitresses at the
same time chime in--


705
0:24:19,18 --> 0:24:20,25
the blacks.


706
0:24:20,25 --> 0:24:21,88
The blacks?


707
0:24:21,88 --> 0:24:22,46
OK.


708
0:24:22,46 --> 0:24:24,89
And explain why.


709
0:24:24,89 --> 0:24:28,2
So the reasons why the
blacks are the worst.


710
0:24:28,2 --> 0:24:30,17
And this is not just at
four in the morning


711
0:24:30,17 --> 0:24:30,69
when they're drunk.


712
0:24:30,69 --> 0:24:32,39
It's at all hours.


713
0:24:32,39 --> 0:24:33,51
They're annoying.


714
0:24:33,51 --> 0:24:35,59
They're loud.


715
0:24:35,59 --> 0:24:39,91
And why they choose [BLEEP], not
IHOP or Denny's is because


716
0:24:39,91 --> 0:24:40,95
chicken and waffles.


717
0:24:40,95 --> 0:24:42,56
And it's cheap.


718
0:24:42,56 --> 0:24:45,49
And so according to
Texas [BLEEP]


719
0:24:45,49 --> 0:24:49,8
Amarillo, the blacks are
the worst people.


720
0:24:49,8 --> 0:24:50,258
I disagree.


721
0:24:50,258 --> 0:24:52,95



722
0:24:52,95 --> 0:24:56,725
Besides truck stops, 24 hour
super mega-mats can be a haven


723
0:24:56,725 --> 0:25:0,55
for drifters like us.


724
0:25:0,55 --> 0:25:3,12
And I will show you
why in one second.


725
0:25:3,12 --> 0:25:3,39
Come on.


726
0:25:3,39 --> 0:25:4,384
Follow me.


727
0:25:4,384 --> 0:25:5,634
Let's go.


728
0:25:5,634 --> 0:25:9,851



729
0:25:9,851 --> 0:25:12,169
Besides the awesome savings,
when you get here late at


730
0:25:12,169 --> 0:25:14,821
night, everyone is cracked out,
including the workers.


731
0:25:14,821 --> 0:25:17,803
Sp they pretty much let you
get away with murder.


732
0:25:17,803 --> 0:25:22,773
We got an awesome ride and
if we are lucky, a


733
0:25:22,773 --> 0:25:24,23
good place to sleep.


734
0:25:24,23 --> 0:25:30,228



735
0:25:30,228 --> 0:25:33,707
Do you remember these things,
this fun game you played when


736
0:25:33,707 --> 0:25:35,695
you were kids.


737
0:25:35,695 --> 0:25:38,2
You just open up.


738
0:25:38,2 --> 0:25:39,66
And you go to sleep.


739
0:25:39,66 --> 0:25:40,91
Good night.


740
0:25:40,91 --> 0:27:40,91
