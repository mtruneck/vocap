0:0:1,25 --> 0:0:21,74



3
0:0:21,74 --> 0:0:24,1
MALE SPEAKER: What led
you to join PJAK?

6
0:0:41,6 --> 0:0:43,92
MALE SPEAKER: Apo is like
the Kurdish Mao.


7
0:0:43,92 --> 0:0:47,43
Really, he is the Kurdish Mao,
since all he did was basically


8
0:0:47,43 --> 0:0:50,135
take Mao's Little Red Book and
tweak a couple points to make


9
0:0:50,135 --> 0:0:54,9
it more "Kurdy." So Apoism is
an essentially a grassroots


10
0:0:54,9 --> 0:0:56,435
socialist movement that promotes
full gender equality


11
0:0:56,435 --> 0:0:58,65
and guerrilla warfare, hearts
and minds, 1,000


12
0:0:58,65 --> 0:1:0,7
blossoms, et cetera--


13
0:1:0,7 --> 0:1:1,48
but for Kurds.


14
0:1:1,48 --> 0:1:6,4
Apo is the political father
of both the PKK and PJAK.


15
0:1:6,4 --> 0:1:8,64
Like with most good leftists,
feminism is a


16
0:1:8,64 --> 0:1:10,73
staple of Apoist thought.


17
0:1:10,73 --> 0:1:13,14
PJAK likes to claim that roughly
50% of their fighting


18
0:1:13,14 --> 0:1:14,16
forces is women--


19
0:1:14,16 --> 0:1:16,8
which is pretty progressive in
general, but completely insane


20
0:1:16,8 --> 0:1:18,68
for the Middle East.

RUKEN: [SPEAKING KURDISH]


24
0:1:35,17 --> 0:2:3,78



25
0:2:3,78 --> 0:2:6,18
MALE SPEAKER: Kurdish society
seems to put such a strong


26
0:2:6,18 --> 0:2:7,68
emphasis on the family.


27
0:2:7,68 --> 0:2:11,21
Do women in PJAK, are they able
to have families and be


28
0:2:11,21 --> 0:2:12,3
part of that too?


29
0:2:12,3 --> 0:2:13,85
Or is that something
you have to give


30
0:2:13,85 --> 0:2:15,42
up to become a soldier?


31
0:2:15,42 --> 0:2:16,67
RUKEN: [SPEAKING KURDISH]


32
0:2:16,67 --> 0:2:33,6



33
0:2:33,6 --> 0:2:36,25



34
0:2:36,25 --> 0:2:38,25
MALE SPEAKER: The conventional
view of liberated women is a


35
0:2:38,25 --> 0:2:41,12
bunch of crew-cut, masculated
butchies--


36
0:2:41,12 --> 0:2:42,96
basically women acting
like men.


37
0:2:42,96 --> 0:2:45,61
But aside from the uniforms and
in spite of the strictures


38
0:2:45,61 --> 0:2:48,59
against motherhood and fucking,
the female PJAK


39
0:2:48,59 --> 0:2:50,71
fighters we'd seen so far
all preserved a sense of


40
0:2:50,71 --> 0:2:53,99
femininity that went well with
their Kalashnikov in a kind of


41
0:2:53,99 --> 0:2:56,8
Leila Khaled meets the Viet Cong
sniper from Full Metal


42
0:2:56,8 --> 0:2:58,5
Jacket way.


43
0:2:58,5 --> 0:3:0,18

48
0:3:39,97 --> 0:3:56,3



49
0:3:56,3 --> 0:3:57,65
MALE SPEAKER: While everything
sounded good, we were well


50
0:3:57,65 --> 0:4:0,7
aware that we were still at a
press event, and everybody's


51
0:4:0,7 --> 0:4:2,762
answers felt extremely
well-rehearsed.


52
0:4:2,762 --> 0:4:5,52
So we were a little anxious to
get up in PJAK's friends, the


53
0:4:5,52 --> 0:4:7,88
mountains, and see how well
all this translated to the


54
0:4:7,88 --> 0:4:9,13
actual battlefield.

0:4:9,13 --> 0:6:9,13
