FRANK PINELLO: My name is Frank
Pinello, and my place is


18
0:1:2,0 --> 0:1:5,18
Best Pizza.


19
0:1:5,18 --> 0:1:7,91
Best Pizza's pretty much just
a by the slice pizzeria.


20
0:1:7,91 --> 0:1:10,96
Very much a New York-style place
where you could walk in,


21
0:1:10,96 --> 0:1:13,64
grab a slice of pizza, grab
something to drink, and be out


22
0:1:13,64 --> 0:1:16,7
the door in five minutes if
that's what you want.


23
0:1:16,7 --> 0:1:19,59
We're lucky enough to have a
100-year-old wood fire oven,


24
0:1:19,59 --> 0:1:21,82
so we cook the big 20-inch pies
in about four minutes.


25
0:1:21,82 --> 0:1:24,682



26
0:1:24,682 --> 0:1:27,26
Pizza time.


27
0:1:27,26 --> 0:1:29,74
I'm just going to go ahead and
make you a white pizza.


28
0:1:29,74 --> 0:1:33,43
It's like one of our signature
pies over here.


29
0:1:33,43 --> 0:1:35,49
When we first started making
it, we were playing around


30
0:1:35,49 --> 0:1:37,72
with like some arugula and stuff
like that on it, and


31
0:1:37,72 --> 0:1:40,52
then we decided that the white
pie is about the ricotta


32
0:1:40,52 --> 0:1:43,23
cheese, so let's not do
anything too crazy.


33
0:1:43,23 --> 0:1:46,16
Let's let the ricotta cheese
kind of be the star the show.


34
0:1:46,16 --> 0:1:49,1
And we do these caramelized
onions that we let sit on the


35
0:1:49,1 --> 0:1:50,89
raw dough and caramelize
for a long time.


36
0:1:50,89 --> 0:1:53,65
It's how that sweetness that
people always keep talking


37
0:1:53,65 --> 0:1:55,341
about coming in.


38
0:1:55,341 --> 0:2:0,22



39
0:2:0,22 --> 0:2:1,79
Pizza came from Napoli.


40
0:2:1,79 --> 0:2:3,92
And when all those southern
Italian immigrants started


41
0:2:3,92 --> 0:2:6,2
coming over to New York,
everybody started opening up


42
0:2:6,2 --> 0:2:10,3
these small pizzerias, and it
kept a lot of those values of


43
0:2:10,3 --> 0:2:13,2
using really fresh ingredients
and having really great


44
0:2:13,2 --> 0:2:14,15
techniques.


45
0:2:14,15 --> 0:2:17,5
And as time went on, their sons
took it over or they sold


46
0:2:17,5 --> 0:2:19,786
the pizzerias, and I think
people started realizing, oh,


47
0:2:19,786 --> 0:2:22,5
you know we could just use
shitty pepperoni and shitty


48
0:2:22,5 --> 0:2:25,54
mozzarella cheese and make
a whole lot more money.


49
0:2:25,54 --> 0:2:27,67
We started realizing, man, this
pizza isn't as good as it


50
0:2:27,67 --> 0:2:28,66
used to be.


51
0:2:28,66 --> 0:2:31,77
So when we finally got in here,
it was important to me


52
0:2:31,77 --> 0:2:34,41
to try to preserve some of those
old techniques and those


53
0:2:34,41 --> 0:2:38,8
ideas of using the best stuff
that you possibly can and hope


54
0:2:38,8 --> 0:2:39,33
that we'll make it up.


55
0:2:39,33 --> 0:2:44,19



56
0:2:44,19 --> 0:2:46,582
I know a lot of people love
pizza across the world-- you


57
0:2:46,582 --> 0:2:48,75
know what I I mean-- across the
country, but I'm not so


58
0:2:48,75 --> 0:2:51,66
sure that anyone has done it
better than Brooklyn--


59
0:2:51,66 --> 0:2:53,45
like Napoli, like anywhere.


60
0:2:53,45 --> 0:2:55,4
Pizza and Brooklyn
go hand in hand.


61
0:2:55,4 --> 0:2:56,53
I thought it would only be
right to bring you to


62
0:2:56,53 --> 0:2:57,59
Bensonhurst, of course.


63
0:2:57,59 --> 0:2:58,61
Billy.


64
0:2:58,61 --> 0:2:59,81
Billy.


65
0:2:59,81 --> 0:3:1,46
My partner in crime is Bill.


66
0:3:1,46 --> 0:3:4,23
Bill is a delivery guy here,
but we spend a lot of time


67
0:3:4,23 --> 0:3:6,64
together out at the bars,
so I figured I'd bring


68
0:3:6,64 --> 0:3:9,11
Bill along as well.


69
0:3:9,11 --> 0:3:11,15
I've worked in pizzerias
my entire life.


70
0:3:11,15 --> 0:3:14,825
Delivery is a huge part of pizza
places, and the second I


71
0:3:14,825 --> 0:3:19,18
met Bill, I knew it was a
match made in heaven.


72
0:3:19,18 --> 0:3:22,47
BILL: I've been a bike
messenger since 1982.


73
0:3:22,47 --> 0:3:24,83
FRANK PINELLO: I've seen Bill
take eight pies in a bag, and


74
0:3:24,83 --> 0:3:26,23
to me, like that's
mind blowing.


75
0:3:26,23 --> 0:3:29,67
This guy rides a fixed gear
bike with no brakes on it.


76
0:3:29,67 --> 0:3:32,9
BILL: I have a break.


77
0:3:32,9 --> 0:3:34,8
FRANK PINELLO: And sometimes
it'll be like torrential


78
0:3:34,8 --> 0:3:38,14
downpour, and he'll be fucking
soaked to the bone, but he


79
0:3:38,14 --> 0:3:39,3
gets the job done, man.


80
0:3:39,3 --> 0:3:42,25
But we get the job done.


81
0:3:42,25 --> 0:3:45,55
I think it was Brandon's from
the Bergess's to get you a


82
0:3:45,55 --> 0:3:47,75
cape, and I was like,
fuck yes.


83
0:3:47,75 --> 0:3:52,23
BILL: I told him I would
totally rock the cape.


84
0:3:52,23 --> 0:3:54,16
FRANK PINELLO: For me, the
home base for pizza--


85
0:3:54,16 --> 0:3:56,95
18th avenue in Bensonhurst is
a old Sicilian neighborhood,


86
0:3:56,95 --> 0:3:58,38
and they got some
great pizzerias.


87
0:3:58,38 --> 0:4:9,3



88
0:4:9,3 --> 0:4:12,81
J&V Pizza is a great by the
slice pizzeria that's on the


89
0:4:12,81 --> 0:4:15,732
corner of 64th Street
and 18th Avenue.


90
0:4:15,732 --> 0:4:19,16
Like the square slice at J&V
is what their known for.


91
0:4:19,16 --> 0:4:21,74
As a kid, I used to always go
there and scrape up some


92
0:4:21,74 --> 0:4:25,34
change, grab a square slice from
J&V and an Italian ice,


93
0:4:25,34 --> 0:4:27,403
and my afternoon was made.


94
0:4:27,403 --> 0:4:28,505
What's up, Pop?


95
0:4:28,505 --> 0:4:32,17
Can I get four squares please?


96
0:4:32,17 --> 0:4:34,59
Thank you, Papa.


97
0:4:34,59 --> 0:4:36,13
Bill, sit down.


98
0:4:36,13 --> 0:4:37,38
Let's eat.


99
0:4:37,38 --> 0:4:39,57



100
0:4:39,57 --> 0:4:43,93
A proper square Sicilian slice
is a nice thick, fluffy slice,


101
0:4:43,93 --> 0:4:47,41
a crusty bottom, a nice fluffy
middle, a saucy,


102
0:4:47,41 --> 0:4:48,99
cheesy top to it.


103
0:4:48,99 --> 0:4:50,83
So it's like three different
components.


104
0:4:50,83 --> 0:4:54,98
And when you get that ratio
right, that's a


105
0:4:54,98 --> 0:4:55,94
good Sicilian slice.


106
0:4:55,94 --> 0:4:57,0
BILL: Crispity crunchy
on the bottom.


107
0:4:57,0 --> 0:4:58,91
Nice and fluffy in the middle.


108
0:4:58,91 --> 0:5:1,568



109
0:5:1,568 --> 0:5:2,46
[INAUDIBLE].


110
0:5:2,46 --> 0:5:3,725
FRANK PINELLO: The cheese
is really good.


111
0:5:3,725 --> 0:5:6,72
You can tell, like, this is one
of those places that just


112
0:5:6,72 --> 0:5:8,21
kept the quality up throughout
the years,


113
0:5:8,21 --> 0:5:8,74
you know what I mean.


114
0:5:8,74 --> 0:5:11,75
You could look around and see
how many pizza boxes they


115
0:5:11,75 --> 0:5:13,12
have, and you know that these
guys are doing really good


116
0:5:13,12 --> 0:5:14,94
business and that they're a
staple in the neighborhood.


117
0:5:14,94 --> 0:5:19,334



118
0:5:19,334 --> 0:5:21,67
From J&V, we want
to DaVinci's.


119
0:5:21,67 --> 0:5:22,31
Thank you, man.


120
0:5:22,31 --> 0:5:24,6
Take care, buddy.


121
0:5:24,6 --> 0:5:26,0
And that was sort of like
always the toss up.


122
0:5:26,0 --> 0:5:28,7
Like when we had a couple bucks
in our pocket or my


123
0:5:28,7 --> 0:5:30,38
grandmother maybe didn't feel
like cooking and wanted to


124
0:5:30,38 --> 0:5:32,18
order some pizzas, it was always
like, all right, where


125
0:5:32,18 --> 0:5:35,71
are we going, J&V
or DaVinci's?


126
0:5:35,71 --> 0:5:37,58
Here we are.


127
0:5:37,58 --> 0:5:39,62
The world famous DaVinci's
Pizzeria.


128
0:5:39,62 --> 0:5:47,67



129
0:5:47,67 --> 0:5:50,95
Every classic pizzeria offers
their version of a square and


130
0:5:50,95 --> 0:5:55,14
their version of a round, and
J&V for me was the square


131
0:5:55,14 --> 0:5:56,61
size, DaVinci's was the round.


132
0:5:56,61 --> 0:6:1,57



133
0:6:1,57 --> 0:6:4,802
And as you can see, these
guys do a nice job.


134
0:6:4,802 --> 0:6:8,176
Beautiful crust,
nice and thick.


135
0:6:8,176 --> 0:6:9,426
Let's give it a shot.


136
0:6:9,426 --> 0:6:12,53



137
0:6:12,53 --> 0:6:13,77
ANGELO GNERRE: It's always
been the same.


138
0:6:13,77 --> 0:6:14,59
The recipe hasn't changed.


139
0:6:14,59 --> 0:6:16,72
I just try to perfect it.


140
0:6:16,72 --> 0:6:18,495
Maybe I add a little of this,
a little of that.


141
0:6:18,495 --> 0:6:21,31
I use different types of flour
to give it that color, that


142
0:6:21,31 --> 0:6:25,45
consistency, that flavor,
that crunchiness.


143
0:6:25,45 --> 0:6:25,805
FRANK PINELLO: Classic.


144
0:6:25,805 --> 0:6:27,12
These guys know how
to do it right.


145
0:6:27,12 --> 0:6:31,44



146
0:6:31,44 --> 0:6:33,96
So we were feeling pretty
full after DaVinci's--


147
0:6:33,96 --> 0:6:35,25
Thank you so much, man.


148
0:6:35,25 --> 0:6:38,48
--and it was only right to bring
you guys to Villabate.


149
0:6:38,48 --> 0:6:42,5
It's just like Sicily rolled up
into a ball and like thrown


150
0:6:42,5 --> 0:6:43,75
in like a store front.


151
0:6:43,75 --> 0:6:51,46



152
0:6:51,46 --> 0:6:54,34
They make great espresso, like
really, really tasty, and the


153
0:6:54,34 --> 0:6:58,6
flavor of the coffee when
it was in your mouth.


154
0:6:58,6 --> 0:7:0,432
When I worked for a chef that
I really loved, what I would


155
0:7:0,432 --> 0:7:3,57
do is come here and by them a
dozen cannolis and bring it to


156
0:7:3,57 --> 0:7:4,27
them as a treat.


157
0:7:4,27 --> 0:7:7,2
And the second they tasted it,
they knew that it was like the


158
0:7:7,2 --> 0:7:8,62
primo stuff.


159
0:7:8,62 --> 0:7:9,85
Here you go--


160
0:7:9,85 --> 0:7:11,82
Sicilian-style cannoli.


161
0:7:11,82 --> 0:7:13,7
This place does it the best.


162
0:7:13,7 --> 0:7:16,6



163
0:7:16,6 --> 0:7:17,8
Thank you very much.


164
0:7:17,8 --> 0:7:20,39
Grazie [INAUDIBLE].


165
0:7:20,39 --> 0:7:21,64
Amazing.


166
0:7:21,64 --> 0:7:23,82



167
0:7:23,82 --> 0:7:25,922
Come on, Bill.


168
0:7:25,922 --> 0:7:27,74
BILL: --being on a TV
show right now.


169
0:7:27,74 --> 0:7:30,26
It's called "Munchies."


170
0:7:30,26 --> 0:7:31,55
FRANK PINELLO: I lived in
Brooklyn till I was about 10


171
0:7:31,55 --> 0:7:33,99
years old, and then my family
moved out to Long Island.


172
0:7:33,99 --> 0:7:36,9
On the weekends, you would
always sort of drive back to


173
0:7:36,9 --> 0:7:39,28
Brooklyn to spend the weekend
with my grandmother.


174
0:7:39,28 --> 0:7:41,54
And as soon as you would kind
of like approach the steps,


175
0:7:41,54 --> 0:7:43,99
you could like smell the aroma
of what my grandmother was


176
0:7:43,99 --> 0:7:46,4
been cooking for like the last
three or four hours.


177
0:7:46,4 --> 0:7:47,84
Oh yeah.


178
0:7:47,84 --> 0:7:50,52
My grandmother would buzz us
in and the door would open,


179
0:7:50,52 --> 0:7:53,77
walk down the long hallway, and
that aroma starts getting


180
0:7:53,77 --> 0:7:56,47
a little bit more strong.


181
0:7:56,47 --> 0:7:56,835
DIANE PINELLO: Frank?


182
0:7:56,835 --> 0:7:57,2
FRANK PINELLO: Yes.


183
0:7:57,2 --> 0:7:58,83
DIANE PINELLO: Hi.


184
0:7:58,83 --> 0:8:2,8
Shower us with hugs and kisses
and then walk right through


185
0:8:2,8 --> 0:8:4,6
the little doorway, and bam--
the table would just be


186
0:8:4,6 --> 0:8:6,72
stocked with food.


187
0:8:6,72 --> 0:8:7,22
BILL: Oh wow.


188
0:8:7,22 --> 0:8:8,27
FRANK PINELLO: You
got some food?


189
0:8:8,27 --> 0:8:9,846
DIANE PINELLO: Well, it's 8
o'clock and you can't keep a


190
0:8:9,846 --> 0:8:11,61
room full of Italians--


191
0:8:11,61 --> 0:8:14,1
FRANK PINELLO: Oh, what's
up, Thomas?


192
0:8:14,1 --> 0:8:16,5
What's going on with
everybody?


193
0:8:16,5 --> 0:8:19,1
I had never imagined I would
take that walk with Bill.


194
0:8:19,1 --> 0:8:19,52
Hi.


195
0:8:19,52 --> 0:8:20,77
How are you?


196
0:8:20,77 --> 0:8:26,16



197
0:8:26,16 --> 0:8:27,28
Everybody sit down.


198
0:8:27,28 --> 0:8:28,53
Eat.


199
0:8:28,53 --> 0:8:31,5



200
0:8:31,5 --> 0:8:32,435
BILL: Oh sweet.


201
0:8:32,435 --> 0:8:33,965
Thank you very much.


202
0:8:33,965 --> 0:8:35,89
FRANK PINELLO: We talked a
lot about pizza today.


203
0:8:35,89 --> 0:8:37,429
This is the style of pizza
that I grew up eating--


204
0:8:37,429 --> 0:8:39,75
country-style grandma's pizza.


205
0:8:39,75 --> 0:8:43,11
My grandmother stuffed this one
with some tomatoes, some


206
0:8:43,11 --> 0:8:46,65
caramelized onions, possibly
some anchovies in there--


207
0:8:46,65 --> 0:8:47,52
I haven't tasted it yet,
so I'm not sure.


208
0:8:47,52 --> 0:8:49,15
But this is the way we do it.


209
0:8:49,15 --> 0:8:51,97
Full table full of food, and
eat until we're stuffed.


210
0:8:51,97 --> 0:8:56,19



211
0:8:56,19 --> 0:8:57,57
My grandmother put out
a lot of dishes.


212
0:8:57,57 --> 0:8:59,94
I know she knew that camera was
coming, but I'll be honest


213
0:8:59,94 --> 0:9:1,19
with you, it's always
like that.


214
0:9:1,19 --> 0:9:4,1



215
0:9:4,1 --> 0:9:8,42
Classic Sicilian pasta
right here.


216
0:9:8,42 --> 0:9:11,732
Put a little bit of bread
crumbs as a topping.


217
0:9:11,732 --> 0:9:14,29
A lot of people in Sicily
couldn't afford cheese as a


218
0:9:14,29 --> 0:9:17,3
topping, so you see bread crumb
pretty often on top of


219
0:9:17,3 --> 0:9:20,29
pasta, which it's starch on
starch but like the texture


220
0:9:20,29 --> 0:9:21,85
combination goes really,
really well.

FRANK PINELLO: Yeah I know.


224
0:9:30,785 --> 0:9:32,84
He needs to eat, right, Nonna?


225
0:9:32,84 --> 0:9:35,375
He needs to eat.

STEVE PINELLO: He loved to eat,
and he was like around


236
0:9:52,4 --> 0:9:55,9
the kitchen when my wife,
Diane, was cooking.


237
0:9:55,9 --> 0:9:59,28
He would actually advise us
as to what spice to use


238
0:9:59,28 --> 0:10:0,12
every now and then.


239
0:10:0,12 --> 0:10:6,73
He would kind of put his own two
cents into it as to say.

FRANK PINELLO: My family was
never rich by any means, you


241
0:10:8,68 --> 0:10:9,125
know what I mean.


242
0:10:9,125 --> 0:10:12,1
We always grew up in apartments
in Brooklyn, but


243
0:10:12,1 --> 0:10:13,79
the one thing that we
did right was eat.


244
0:10:13,79 --> 0:10:16,4
The commitment to food that I
think Sicilian people have in


245
0:10:16,4 --> 0:10:17,83
general, it's crazy.


246
0:10:17,83 --> 0:10:21,31
It's amazing, and I feel lucky
that I was born into it.

249
0:10:25,37 --> 0:10:25,76
All right.


250
0:10:25,76 --> 0:10:26,76
Thanks again you all.


251
0:10:26,76 --> 0:10:28,35
It's great to see you.


252
0:10:28,35 --> 0:10:30,14
STEVE PINELLO: Bill, be
careful, brother.


253
0:10:30,14 --> 0:10:30,84

FRANK PINELLO: After we left
grandma's house, we came back


258
0:10:42,77 --> 0:10:44,2
to Best Pizza.


259
0:10:44,2 --> 0:10:48,26



260
0:10:48,26 --> 0:10:50,33
And we had some friends waiting
for us here, and we


261
0:10:50,33 --> 0:10:52,83
did a meatball pizza, which is
starting to become a popular


262
0:10:52,83 --> 0:10:55,21
pie here, especially towards
the end of the night when


263
0:10:55,21 --> 0:10:57,96
people come in hammered
from the bar.


264
0:10:57,96 --> 0:11:0,35



265
0:11:0,35 --> 0:11:2,22
We get our meat from
Pat Lafrieda.


266
0:11:2,22 --> 0:11:4,92
It's 50% short rib,
50% brisket.


267
0:11:4,92 --> 0:11:8,51
All that fat is flavor, so we
want to make sure that we get


268
0:11:8,51 --> 0:11:12,27
all that nice, beautiful, clear
fat mixed in with those


269
0:11:12,27 --> 0:11:14,97
meatballs and back on
top of the pizza.


270
0:11:14,97 --> 0:11:19,1
Pizza is like the perfect
accompaniment for drinking.


271
0:11:19,1 --> 0:11:22,21
You come into a pizzeria, you
have a few beers, some pizza.


272
0:11:22,21 --> 0:11:25,18
You get yourself a nice base
before you go out to the bar


273
0:11:25,18 --> 0:11:28,4
and usually get hungry at
the end of the night.


274
0:11:28,4 --> 0:11:30,58
If you're done partying with
your buds, coming back and


275
0:11:30,58 --> 0:11:34,11
having a nice fresh pie out of
the oven is to me-- it's like


276
0:11:34,11 --> 0:11:35,46
you can't go wrong.


277
0:11:35,46 --> 0:11:38,953
