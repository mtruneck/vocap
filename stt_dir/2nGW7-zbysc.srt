0:9:46,81 --> 0:9:48,29
BETH HOYT: Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.


3
0:9:48,29 --> 0:9:51,95
Welcome to the final night of
YouTube Comedy Week in sunny


4
0:9:51,95 --> 0:9:53,55
Playa-- who gives a shit.


5
0:9:53,55 --> 0:9:54,78
I'm Beth Hoyt.


6
0:9:54,78 --> 0:9:57,0
MICHAEL GALLAGHER:
Thank you, Diane.


7
0:9:57,0 --> 0:10:0,13
As you can see, all the
stars are here tonight


8
0:10:0,13 --> 0:10:1,86
for Set List Live.


9
0:10:1,86 --> 0:10:3,83
You can literally smell
the glamour.


10
0:10:3,83 --> 0:10:5,4
Isn't that right,
Steve Greene?


11
0:10:5,4 --> 0:10:7,78
STEVE GREENE: Michael, if you're
not here you might as


12
0:10:7,78 --> 0:10:9,7
well be dead.


13
0:10:9,7 --> 0:10:11,42
BETH HOYT: Or you can just watch
it from home on your--


14
0:10:11,42 --> 0:10:13,94
on youtube.com/comedyweek, so.


15
0:10:13,94 --> 0:10:16,45
MICHAEL GALLAGHER: Diane, if you
missed any of this week's


16
0:10:16,45 --> 0:10:20,4
webtastic events you can use
your mouse and literally walk


17
0:10:20,4 --> 0:10:20,95
the red carpet--


18
0:10:20,95 --> 0:10:22,47
that is, your mouse pad--


19
0:10:22,47 --> 0:10:25,4
youtube.com/comedyweek.


20
0:10:25,4 --> 0:10:28,5
STEVE GREENE: If you're not
drinking yet, crack open a


21
0:10:28,5 --> 0:10:31,6
bottle because Smosh, The
Annoying Orange, and The Onion


22
0:10:31,6 --> 0:10:34,4
all have uploaded new
videos on YouTube.


23
0:10:34,4 --> 0:10:37,5
BETH HOYT: As well as two new
videos, Henry Phillips' "You


24
0:10:37,5 --> 0:10:40,3
and Your Fucking Coffee" and the
Eric Wareheim Major Lazer


25
0:10:40,3 --> 0:10:43,6
video collaboration,
"Bubble Butt."


26
0:10:43,6 --> 0:10:45,15
MICHAEL GALLAGHER: I don't know
about you, Steve, but I


27
0:10:45,15 --> 0:10:45,97
have a boner.


28
0:10:45,97 --> 0:10:48,46
BETH HOYT: OK.


29
0:10:48,46 --> 0:10:49,7
MICHAEL GALLAGHER: Diane,
how you doing there?


30
0:10:49,7 --> 0:10:51,61
BETH HOYT: See, well, my name
is Beth, so there's that.


31
0:10:51,61 --> 0:10:53,53
But also, you guys are really
going off book.


32
0:10:53,53 --> 0:10:56,41
STEVE GREENE: Diane, I don't
know how you are, but I could


33
0:10:56,41 --> 0:10:58,54
fill a cup.


34
0:10:58,54 --> 0:10:59,93
With excitement.


35
0:10:59,93 --> 0:11:0,36
BETH HOYT: Right.


36
0:11:0,36 --> 0:11:1,76
MICHAEL GALLAGHER: That's
what I'm talking about.


37
0:11:1,76 --> 0:11:3,86
Male juices.


38
0:11:3,86 --> 0:11:4,63
Comedy Week!


39
0:11:4,63 --> 0:11:6,31
BETH HOYT: Can we-- can we
get security over here?


40
0:11:6,31 --> 0:11:6,68
Is that--?


41
0:11:6,68 --> 0:11:7,9
MICHAEL GALLAGHER:
Thank you, Diane!


42
0:11:7,9 --> 0:11:8,57
Thank you, America!


43
0:11:8,57 --> 0:11:9,51
STEVE GREENE: Enjoy
the glamour!


44
0:11:9,51 --> 0:11:9,97
Enjoy the Hollywood!


45
0:11:9,97 --> 0:11:10,383
MICHAEL GALLAGHER: Good night!


46
0:11:10,383 --> 0:11:10,59
Good night!


47
0:11:10,59 --> 0:11:11,716
We're this way, Steve.


48
0:11:11,716 --> 0:11:12,102
BETH HOYT: Awesome.


49
0:11:12,102 --> 0:11:12,49
OK, great.


50
0:11:12,49 --> 0:11:14,82
Once again--


51
0:11:14,82 --> 0:11:15,59
OK.


52
0:11:15,59 --> 0:11:16,34
Right.


53
0:11:16,34 --> 0:11:17,71
Great.


54
0:11:17,71 --> 0:11:20,5
Also, just to throw it in there
again, my name is Beth.


55
0:11:20,5 --> 0:11:21,58
Beth in Show, Beth Hoyt.


56
0:11:21,58 --> 0:11:21,92
Thanks a lot.


57
0:11:21,92 --> 0:11:22,39
Thanks, guys.


58
0:11:22,39 --> 0:11:22,99
OK.


59
0:11:22,99 --> 0:11:25,17
We'll be back a little later for
the second show, but right


60
0:11:25,17 --> 0:11:28,312
now here's Set List Live.


61
0:11:28,312 --> 0:11:38,95
[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]


62
0:11:38,95 --> 0:11:40,9
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, YouTube!


63
0:11:40,9 --> 0:11:42,46
Welcome to Set List, Stand-Up
Without a Net.


64
0:11:42,46 --> 0:11:44,84
Now here's your host,
Paul Provenza!


65
0:11:44,84 --> 0:11:48,53



66
0:11:48,53 --> 0:11:50,5
PAUL PROVENZA: Thank you.


67
0:11:50,5 --> 0:11:52,19
Good evening.


68
0:11:52,19 --> 0:11:53,47
Hello, YouTube.


69
0:11:53,47 --> 0:11:56,51



70
0:11:56,51 --> 0:11:59,5
What are you doing
with your lives?


71
0:11:59,5 --> 0:12:2,7
Welcome to Set List, Stand-Up
Without a Net.


72
0:12:2,7 --> 0:12:3,0
It's very exciting.


73
0:12:3,0 --> 0:12:5,67
This is our first live
stream ever.


74
0:12:5,67 --> 0:12:8,9
It's really, really exciting
for us because stands--


75
0:12:8,9 --> 0:12:10,81
Set List is a different kind
of stand up comedy show.


76
0:12:10,81 --> 0:12:13,63
Set List is unique.


77
0:12:13,63 --> 0:12:15,62
Now normally when you see a
stand up comedian perform,


78
0:12:15,62 --> 0:12:17,17
you're seeing them give you
material that they have


79
0:12:17,17 --> 0:12:20,13
created, they have crafted,
they have honed, they have


80
0:12:20,13 --> 0:12:22,67
perfected, to give
you the very best


81
0:12:22,67 --> 0:12:25,1
for your comedy value.


82
0:12:25,1 --> 0:12:26,54
That's too much hard work.


83
0:12:26,54 --> 0:12:29,42
None of that happens here.


84
0:12:29,42 --> 0:12:31,34
What happens here is
far more dangerous.


85
0:12:31,34 --> 0:12:34,6
The comedians are going to take
a leap into the comedy


86
0:12:34,6 --> 0:12:36,77
unknown, ladies and gentlemen.


87
0:12:36,77 --> 0:12:39,2
Now let me explain what
a set list is.


88
0:12:39,2 --> 0:12:42,92
A set list looks something
like this--


89
0:12:42,92 --> 0:12:44,43
something like this--


90
0:12:44,43 --> 0:12:45,18
there you go.


91
0:12:45,18 --> 0:12:46,67
This is a set list for a band.


92
0:12:46,67 --> 0:12:48,41
It's basically the names
of their titles--


93
0:12:48,41 --> 0:12:49,85
the titles of their songs--
in the order


94
0:12:49,85 --> 0:12:50,99
they're going to do them.


95
0:12:50,99 --> 0:12:52,41
Everybody knows what
the show is.


96
0:12:52,41 --> 0:12:53,65
A comedian's set list?


97
0:12:53,65 --> 0:12:55,97
A little bit different.


98
0:12:55,97 --> 0:12:59,56
Generally written on the back
of the hand, because nobody


99
0:12:59,56 --> 0:13:0,42
else has to see it.


100
0:13:0,42 --> 0:13:1,86
And these words here--


101
0:13:1,86 --> 0:13:3,17
who knows what they mean?


102
0:13:3,17 --> 0:13:5,64
Only the comedian knows what's
on their set list.


103
0:13:5,64 --> 0:13:7,315
Two words could be 15
minutes of material.


104
0:13:7,315 --> 0:13:9,7
It could be a phrase they want
to remember to try out.


105
0:13:9,7 --> 0:13:10,14
Who knows?


106
0:13:10,14 --> 0:13:11,53
It could mean anything.


107
0:13:11,53 --> 0:13:12,91
Only the comedian knows.


108
0:13:12,91 --> 0:13:15,74
Well, tonight, ladies and
gentlemen, we are taking out


109
0:13:15,74 --> 0:13:17,9
of that comfort zone
some of the finest


110
0:13:17,9 --> 0:13:18,89
comedians in America.


111
0:13:18,89 --> 0:13:20,9
They are coming up
here without a


112
0:13:20,9 --> 0:13:21,48
set list of any kind.


113
0:13:21,48 --> 0:13:23,76
We are going to give
them a set list.


114
0:13:23,76 --> 0:13:26,86
They are going to improvise a
stand up comedy routine out of


115
0:13:26,86 --> 0:13:31,236
thin air for your sadistic
enjoyment.


116
0:13:31,236 --> 0:13:37,2
[APPLAUSE]


117
0:13:37,2 --> 0:13:40,58
Here's an example of some of
the kinds of items we'll be


118
0:13:40,58 --> 0:13:41,78
giving them.


119
0:13:41,78 --> 0:13:45,45
Shame Ringtone, I think you know
when that one comes in.


120
0:13:45,45 --> 0:13:46,7
Caucasionally.


121
0:13:46,7 --> 0:13:49,6



122
0:13:49,6 --> 0:13:52,23
Violent Vegan Poetry.


123
0:13:52,23 --> 0:13:52,77
Frenema.


124
0:13:52,77 --> 0:13:56,53
I could do 10 minutes on
that myself, folks.


125
0:13:56,53 --> 0:13:59,12
But we guarantee that none of
the set list items that the


126
0:13:59,12 --> 0:14:1,96
comedians will be given tonight
have appeared on any


127
0:14:1,96 --> 0:14:4,89
comedian's set list ever.


128
0:14:4,89 --> 0:14:6,5
They've never seen them.


129
0:14:6,5 --> 0:14:7,12
You've never seen them.


130
0:14:7,12 --> 0:14:9,72
They will come up here, they
will appear on the screen one


131
0:14:9,72 --> 0:14:12,21
at a time, the comedians will
see their set list topics at


132
0:14:12,21 --> 0:14:13,95
the exact same moment that
you see them for


133
0:14:13,95 --> 0:14:15,12
the very first time.


134
0:14:15,12 --> 0:14:17,18
We're not only taking them out
of their comfort zone by


135
0:14:17,18 --> 0:14:19,31
leaving them up here with set
lists they have never


136
0:14:19,31 --> 0:14:22,15
imagined, we're also taking them
out of their comfort zone


137
0:14:22,15 --> 0:14:24,53
with subject matter or
topics or whatever.


138
0:14:24,53 --> 0:14:28,23
The whole point is to watch
the moment of creation.


139
0:14:28,23 --> 0:14:30,58
It is a journey, ladies
and gentlemen.


140
0:14:30,58 --> 0:14:33,64
Enjoy it.


141
0:14:33,64 --> 0:14:35,98
The comedians have one rule.


142
0:14:35,98 --> 0:14:37,88
That is, use your material--


143
0:14:37,88 --> 0:14:38,65
excuse me.


144
0:14:38,65 --> 0:14:39,54
Sorry.


145
0:14:39,54 --> 0:14:42,22
I just said the worst
thing you could say.


146
0:14:42,22 --> 0:14:43,28
Their rule is use your


147
0:14:43,28 --> 0:14:48,38
imaginations, not your material.


148
0:14:48,38 --> 0:14:49,63
You play a very big part here.


149
0:14:49,63 --> 0:14:54,47
Your role is, don't be a dick.


150
0:14:54,47 --> 0:14:54,79
OK?


151
0:14:54,79 --> 0:14:56,84
They're coming out here, leaping
into the comedy abyss


152
0:14:56,84 --> 0:15:0,26
with nothing protecting them
but really fragile egos.


153
0:15:0,26 --> 0:15:2,8
You must be the wind
under their wings.


154
0:15:2,8 --> 0:15:5,22
You must carry them to
the comedic heights.


155
0:15:5,22 --> 0:15:6,36
You're a big part of this.


156
0:15:6,36 --> 0:15:9,55
You can watch the process, you
can see how each comedian


157
0:15:9,55 --> 0:15:11,14
deals differently with this.


158
0:15:11,14 --> 0:15:11,98
Show them your support.


159
0:15:11,98 --> 0:15:13,25
Show them your love.


160
0:15:13,25 --> 0:15:16,36
Don't be the guy who goes to
the circus and hopes the


161
0:15:16,36 --> 0:15:18,33
tightrope walker doesn't
make it.


162
0:15:18,33 --> 0:15:21,49



163
0:15:21,49 --> 0:15:24,34
That's all you have to do,
ladies and gentlemen.


164
0:15:24,34 --> 0:15:26,34
And I think it'll become
self-explanatory.


165
0:15:26,34 --> 0:15:28,482
Should we just crack on
and give it a go?


166
0:15:28,482 --> 0:15:29,84
[APPLAUSE]


167
0:15:29,84 --> 0:15:30,66
All right!


168
0:15:30,66 --> 0:15:34,88
Keep that energy going,
ladies and gentlemen.


169
0:15:34,88 --> 0:15:38,77
For your first fearless set
lister, here at Set List,


170
0:15:38,77 --> 0:15:42,29
Stand-Up Without a Net, live
streaming on YouTube, ladies


171
0:15:42,29 --> 0:15:44,49
and gentlemen, the never
before seen set


172
0:15:44,49 --> 0:15:46,475
list of Mr. John Dore!


173
0:15:46,475 --> 0:15:52,201



174
0:15:52,201 --> 0:15:52,69
JOHN DORE: Hi.


175
0:15:52,69 --> 0:15:53,94
Thank you, Paul.


176
0:15:53,94 --> 0:15:56,844



177
0:15:56,844 --> 0:15:58,74
Oh, boy.


178
0:15:58,74 --> 0:16:0,44
Here we go.


179
0:16:0,44 --> 0:16:2,76
Stand up without a net.


180
0:16:2,76 --> 0:16:4,47
Set list.


181
0:16:4,47 --> 0:16:5,72
All right.


182
0:16:5,72 --> 0:16:8,17



183
0:16:8,17 --> 0:16:10,1
I'm gonna let you in on a little
secret I've never told


184
0:16:10,1 --> 0:16:13,965
anyone ever before, but
this is a fact.


185
0:16:13,965 --> 0:16:16,86



186
0:16:16,86 --> 0:16:18,975
I am straight.


187
0:16:18,975 --> 0:16:21,95



188
0:16:21,95 --> 0:16:26,61
Never told anyone that before,
but that's one of the reasons


189
0:16:26,61 --> 0:16:29,91
the US government asked me to
do something very special.


190
0:16:29,91 --> 0:16:32,4
They asked me to go and
spy for the Chinese.


191
0:16:32,4 --> 0:16:33,96
And you're probably wondering,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,


192
0:16:33,96 --> 0:16:34,86
whoa, Steve.


193
0:16:34,86 --> 0:16:36,34
And I would say, name's John.


194
0:16:36,34 --> 0:16:38,86
And then you would say, sorry.


195
0:16:38,86 --> 0:16:42,2
John, I thought you were
spying for the Chinese.


196
0:16:42,2 --> 0:16:45,62
It's like, yeah, but who you
think funds the operation?


197
0:16:45,62 --> 0:16:46,79
The United States.


198
0:16:46,79 --> 0:16:47,29
And that's right.


199
0:16:47,29 --> 0:16:48,19
I spy for the Chinese.


200
0:16:48,19 --> 0:16:50,57
You're probably wondering what
I do for the Chinese.


201
0:16:50,57 --> 0:16:52,7
Like, are you concerned?


202
0:16:52,7 --> 0:16:54,5
Like, do you wonder what
I do for the Chinese?


203
0:16:54,5 --> 0:16:55,47
Do you want to know what
I do for the Chinese?


204
0:16:55,47 --> 0:16:57,87
Well I'm not going to fucking
tell you, am I, because then I


205
0:16:57,87 --> 0:17:0,34
wouldn't be a very good spy.


206
0:17:0,34 --> 0:17:2,51
You saying yes, I want to know
what you do for the Chinese,


207
0:17:2,51 --> 0:17:4,76
means you want to see me dead
right here on the spot.


208
0:17:4,76 --> 0:17:6,27
So that's what you want?


209
0:17:6,27 --> 0:17:8,68
Unbelievable.


210
0:17:8,68 --> 0:17:10,81
Unberievable, as some
people would say.


211
0:17:10,81 --> 0:17:12,569
But I'll tell you
this right now.


212
0:17:12,569 --> 0:17:15,49
That's only when I'm spying,
I'll say unberievable.


213
0:17:15,49 --> 0:17:16,74
Only when I'm spying.


214
0:17:16,74 --> 0:17:19,609



215
0:17:19,609 --> 0:17:22,23
Because, yes, I stereotypically
have to fit in


216
0:17:22,23 --> 0:17:23,68
with the Chinese, all right?


217
0:17:23,68 --> 0:17:27,49
And they traditionally have
trouble with L's and R's.


218
0:17:27,49 --> 0:17:29,84
Now let's move on to the next
topic before I get really


219
0:17:29,84 --> 0:17:31,51
racist, all right?


220
0:17:31,51 --> 0:17:32,13
I [? confess ?]


221
0:17:32,13 --> 0:17:37,63
for every one at home and in
the audience and myself.


222
0:17:37,63 --> 0:17:38,52
Oh, boy.


223
0:17:38,52 --> 0:17:39,77
Oh, yeah.


224
0:17:39,77 --> 0:17:45,76



225
0:17:45,76 --> 0:17:50,174
One summer I went camping with
my uncle, and, uh--.


226
0:17:50,174 --> 0:17:53,36
[APPLAUSE]


227
0:17:53,36 --> 0:17:54,13
All right, let's move on.


228
0:17:54,13 --> 0:17:54,84
Let's move on.


229
0:17:54,84 --> 0:17:56,89
All right.


230
0:17:56,89 --> 0:17:58,28
Sometimes that's all
you need, I guess.


231
0:17:58,28 --> 0:17:58,67
I don't know.


232
0:17:58,67 --> 0:17:59,44
Let's move on.


233
0:17:59,44 --> 0:18:0,21
Or maybe there's more.


234
0:18:0,21 --> 0:18:0,75
Don't move on.


235
0:18:0,75 --> 0:18:1,78
Maybe there is more.


236
0:18:1,78 --> 0:18:2,97
Oh, we moved on.


237
0:18:2,97 --> 0:18:3,98
Can we go back?


238
0:18:3,98 --> 0:18:5,34
Oh, we can't go back now!


239
0:18:5,34 --> 0:18:9,68



240
0:18:9,68 --> 0:18:11,0
What do you mean, oh no?


241
0:18:11,0 --> 0:18:12,74
I don't know if you can hear
at home, but a lady


242
0:18:12,74 --> 0:18:14,56
just said, oh no.


243
0:18:14,56 --> 0:18:16,81
Like you've had an abortune.


244
0:18:16,81 --> 0:18:18,78
You don't even know what
an abortune is.


245
0:18:18,78 --> 0:18:20,7
You can't oh no it.


246
0:18:20,7 --> 0:18:23,57
That word doesn't exist until
it came up on the screen.


247
0:18:23,57 --> 0:18:25,8
Oh no, he's going to talk
about abortunes.


248
0:18:25,8 --> 0:18:26,23
Unbeliev--


249
0:18:26,23 --> 0:18:27,48
my daughter had an abortune.


250
0:18:27,48 --> 0:18:31,37



251
0:18:31,37 --> 0:18:33,46
You don't have to be a girl
to have an abortune.


252
0:18:33,46 --> 0:18:35,9
Guys have abortunes.


253
0:18:35,9 --> 0:18:37,66
You don't even know what
an abortune is.


254
0:18:37,66 --> 0:18:39,66
It's not what you think,
all right?


255
0:18:39,66 --> 0:18:42,6
You're thinking it is-- it's
a musical abortion.


256
0:18:42,6 --> 0:18:44,62
That's what you're
all thinking.


257
0:18:44,62 --> 0:18:46,37
You're not far off, I'll
give you that.


258
0:18:46,37 --> 0:18:47,12
You're not far off.


259
0:18:47,12 --> 0:18:49,55
You're very close.


260
0:18:49,55 --> 0:18:50,8
I'll tell you what
an abortune is.


261
0:18:50,8 --> 0:18:54,7



262
0:18:54,7 --> 0:18:55,7
You've heard of the
band Nickelback?


263
0:18:55,7 --> 0:18:57,74
Have you ever heard of
the band Nickelback?


264
0:18:57,74 --> 0:19:0,1
That's an abortune.


265
0:19:0,1 --> 0:19:0,96
Oh, that's a little--


266
0:19:0,96 --> 0:19:2,32
don't clap.


267
0:19:2,32 --> 0:19:4,81
I feel bad about that
one for two reasons.


268
0:19:4,81 --> 0:19:5,73
It is a little too easy.


269
0:19:5,73 --> 0:19:7,84
Also, they are from my home
country of Canada, so I feel


270
0:19:7,84 --> 0:19:9,0
terrible about that.


271
0:19:9,0 --> 0:19:11,33
Let's move on from-- let's
go back to Rock, Paper,


272
0:19:11,33 --> 0:19:13,3
Handjob if we can.


273
0:19:13,3 --> 0:19:14,55
Oh, too late.


274
0:19:14,55 --> 0:19:17,9



275
0:19:17,9 --> 0:19:19,24
Speaking of rock, paper,
handjob, I've got to, to tell


276
0:19:19,24 --> 0:19:20,49
you story here.


277
0:19:20,49 --> 0:19:31,7



278
0:19:31,7 --> 0:19:32,0
This is all part of it.


279
0:19:32,0 --> 0:19:35,68
This is all part of it.


280
0:19:35,68 --> 0:19:38,78
Oh, god.


281
0:19:38,78 --> 0:19:41,16
I used to pace like this
when I was in the


282
0:19:41,16 --> 0:19:42,41
lunch line at school.


283
0:19:42,41 --> 0:19:45,72



284
0:19:45,72 --> 0:19:46,76
Oh, fuck me.


285
0:19:46,76 --> 0:19:49,81
You get one and you're just
like, oh, no what do you do?


286
0:19:49,81 --> 0:19:50,1
But you know what?


287
0:19:50,1 --> 0:19:50,91
You just talk it out.


288
0:19:50,91 --> 0:19:52,16
You just talk it out.


289
0:19:52,16 --> 0:19:55,628



290
0:19:55,628 --> 0:19:59,55
And I'd get to the front of the
line at the cafeteria and


291
0:19:59,55 --> 0:20:6,3
be handed my order and I'd say,
excuse me, what is this?


292
0:20:6,3 --> 0:20:9,6
And the lunch lady would say,
none of your business.


293
0:20:9,6 --> 0:20:11,23
And I'd say, no, no, no, it
actually is my business.


294
0:20:11,23 --> 0:20:11,94
I paid for it.


295
0:20:11,94 --> 0:20:14,28
I want to know what it is.


296
0:20:14,28 --> 0:20:15,99
She'd say, well, it's
not in my job


297
0:20:15,99 --> 0:20:16,91
description to tell you.


298
0:20:16,91 --> 0:20:17,87
And I'd say, you know what?


299
0:20:17,87 --> 0:20:19,66
I think it is.


300
0:20:19,66 --> 0:20:21,84
I want to know what I'm putting
in my body, all right?


301
0:20:21,84 --> 0:20:24,56
I want to know if I'm going
to be replenishing my


302
0:20:24,56 --> 0:20:28,51
carbohydrates while my glycogen
windows are open.


303
0:20:28,51 --> 0:20:30,77
And the lunch lady says,
I don't know what


304
0:20:30,77 --> 0:20:31,94
you're talking about.


305
0:20:31,94 --> 0:20:33,21
I didn't graduate high school.


306
0:20:33,21 --> 0:20:37,4
And then I say, that's
a mean joke.


307
0:20:37,4 --> 0:20:39,33
Like if someone were to say that
on stage, I'm glad you


308
0:20:39,33 --> 0:20:43,303
said it, and some of this--
this is factual-- yeah.


309
0:20:43,303 --> 0:20:47,1



310
0:20:47,1 --> 0:20:50,815
Long story short, you're going
have to buy my CD if you want


311
0:20:50,815 --> 0:20:51,76
to hear the end of it.


312
0:20:51,76 --> 0:20:53,1
Because I haven't quite
written it yet.


313
0:20:53,1 --> 0:20:53,57
Don't clap.


314
0:20:53,57 --> 0:20:54,53
This is horrible.


315
0:20:54,53 --> 0:20:55,65
Trust me, this is horrible.


316
0:20:55,65 --> 0:20:57,1
This is horrible.


317
0:20:57,1 --> 0:21:0,82
Get rid of that one.


318
0:21:0,82 --> 0:21:3,4
[APPLAUSE]


319
0:21:3,4 --> 0:21:4,962
Uh, OK.


320
0:21:4,962 --> 0:21:7,77
For this one I'm going to need a
volunteer from the audience.


321
0:21:7,77 --> 0:21:10,4
Uh, sir, if you don't mind
just come on up here.


322
0:21:10,4 --> 0:21:12,22
Thank you very much.


323
0:21:12,22 --> 0:21:13,8
OK.


324
0:21:13,8 --> 0:21:14,85
And stand right there
for a second.


325
0:21:14,85 --> 0:21:15,97
Yeah.


326
0:21:15,97 --> 0:21:16,82
OK, can sit down now.


327
0:21:16,82 --> 0:21:18,426
Thank you very much.


328
0:21:18,426 --> 0:21:22,32
So remember where
he was, right?


329
0:21:22,32 --> 0:21:25,63
So my uncle would take us
camping and every now and then


330
0:21:25,63 --> 0:21:28,34
he would say, hey, you want
to play a little RPH?


331
0:21:28,34 --> 0:21:31,163
And I would say, I'd say,
yo yo, what are


332
0:21:31,163 --> 0:21:31,98
you, a lunch lady?


333
0:21:31,98 --> 0:21:32,83
What's your agenda?


334
0:21:32,83 --> 0:21:33,7
What's that mean?


335
0:21:33,7 --> 0:21:35,78
And he'd say, no, I'm
not a lunch lady.


336
0:21:35,78 --> 0:21:37,25
It's called rock,
paper, handjob.


337
0:21:37,25 --> 0:21:41,17
And I'd say lookit, I'm not very
comfortable with rock and


338
0:21:41,17 --> 0:21:44,59
paper, but other than that, I
think we've got a deal here.


339
0:21:44,59 --> 0:21:51,366
And long story longer, um,
ladies and gentleman, I'm


340
0:21:51,366 --> 0:21:53,27
going to introduce my uncle
to you right now.


341
0:21:53,27 --> 0:21:54,49
Actually, no, he's not
here to do that.


342
0:21:54,49 --> 0:21:58,8
But if he was here, I'd be very
proud to say he gives one


343
0:21:58,8 --> 0:22:0,3
of the better handjobs,
because--


344
0:22:0,3 --> 0:22:2,0
and I know you're thinking
that's disgusting.


345
0:22:2,0 --> 0:22:3,2
It is not disgusting.


346
0:22:3,2 --> 0:22:3,98
It's tender.


347
0:22:3,98 --> 0:22:4,66
It was very tender.


348
0:22:4,66 --> 0:22:6,21
He wasn't rude about.


349
0:22:6,21 --> 0:22:7,64
It wasn't rude about
it at all.


350
0:22:7,64 --> 0:22:10,24
It didn't feel like incest
at any moment.


351
0:22:10,24 --> 0:22:11,36
It just felt natural.


352
0:22:11,36 --> 0:22:12,2
It felt fun.


353
0:22:12,2 --> 0:22:12,85
It felt--


354
0:22:12,85 --> 0:22:13,98
felt familiar.


355
0:22:13,98 --> 0:22:14,57
Do you know what I mean?


356
0:22:14,57 --> 0:22:16,43
And the reason it felt
familiar's because of course


357
0:22:16,43 --> 0:22:18,54
we share genes.


358
0:22:18,54 --> 0:22:20,27
And we share jeans.


359
0:22:20,27 --> 0:22:22,56
So he's like--


360
0:22:22,56 --> 0:22:23,78
OK, let's skip it.


361
0:22:23,78 --> 0:22:26,29
I don't know what else is going
to happen with that one.


362
0:22:26,29 --> 0:22:28,22
The people watching
at home just--


363
0:22:28,22 --> 0:22:30,66
hey, anyone know the score
of the Sens game?


364
0:22:30,66 --> 0:22:31,76
That'll prove this is
live, by the way.


365
0:22:31,76 --> 0:22:32,7
No?


366
0:22:32,7 --> 0:22:33,21
Anyone know who the Sens are?


367
0:22:33,21 --> 0:22:34,52
They're a hockey team
from Ottawa.


368
0:22:34,52 --> 0:22:35,62
Grow the fuck up.


369
0:22:35,62 --> 0:22:36,87
All right.


370
0:22:36,87 --> 0:22:39,38



371
0:22:39,38 --> 0:22:40,63
Um.


372
0:22:40,63 --> 0:22:42,21



373
0:22:42,21 --> 0:22:45,57
OK, here's the thing.


374
0:22:45,57 --> 0:22:47,14
Don't transfer me, OK?


375
0:22:47,14 --> 0:22:48,35
Leave me in the jail.


376
0:22:48,35 --> 0:22:50,17
I do not want you
to transfer me.


377
0:22:50,17 --> 0:22:51,34
I do not need to go anywhere.


378
0:22:51,34 --> 0:22:53,53
I got a really funny feeling
about this and besides, you


379
0:22:53,53 --> 0:22:55,62
haven't even heard me
out yet, all right?


380
0:22:55,62 --> 0:22:58,81



381
0:22:58,81 --> 0:23:0,83
You ever gone duck hunting
in the city?


382
0:23:0,83 --> 0:23:4,94
It sounds crazy, but I'll
tell you something.


383
0:23:4,94 --> 0:23:7,4
It is loads of fun.


384
0:23:7,4 --> 0:23:8,43
And rarely--


385
0:23:8,43 --> 0:23:11,81
the problem is, he didn't hear
me say duck, all right?


386
0:23:11,81 --> 0:23:14,79
So that's what city
duck hunting is.


387
0:23:14,79 --> 0:23:17,79
You yell duck and hope
the gentleman ducks.


388
0:23:17,79 --> 0:23:21,1
And if he doesn't then the
lady's going to have brain on


389
0:23:21,1 --> 0:23:23,94
her dress and that's
just a fact.


390
0:23:23,94 --> 0:23:25,87
OK, lookit, I know I'm
in America, and--


391
0:23:25,87 --> 0:23:28,64



392
0:23:28,64 --> 0:23:29,58
too soon?


393
0:23:29,58 --> 0:23:30,43
Too soon, is that it?


394
0:23:30,43 --> 0:23:32,63
Probably too late
is what it is.


395
0:23:32,63 --> 0:23:34,2
It's too late.


396
0:23:34,2 --> 0:23:37,25
And guys, you can ew
it if you want, but


397
0:23:37,25 --> 0:23:40,588
this is my big closer.


398
0:23:40,588 --> 0:23:41,6
You know what?


399
0:23:41,6 --> 0:23:41,85
Fuck it.


400
0:23:41,85 --> 0:23:42,47
I'm done.


401
0:23:42,47 --> 0:23:43,838
I'm absolutely finished.


402
0:23:43,838 --> 0:23:46,555
[APPLAUSE]


403
0:23:46,555 --> 0:23:48,0
Hey, Paul.


404
0:23:48,0 --> 0:23:48,924
Sorry about that.


405
0:23:48,924 --> 0:23:49,732
No, I'm--


406
0:23:49,732 --> 0:23:50,54
I'm done.


407
0:23:50,54 --> 0:23:51,66
PAUL PROVENZA: What are
you sorry about, John?


408
0:23:51,66 --> 0:23:53,14
JOHN DORE: Oh, just I'll
see you later.


409
0:23:53,14 --> 0:23:56,71
If you hear a gunshot
go off, that's me.


410
0:23:56,71 --> 0:23:58,374
PAUL PROVENZA: John Dore,
ladies and gentlemen!


411
0:23:58,374 --> 0:24:0,734
[APPLAUSE]


412
0:24:0,734 --> 0:24:3,566
Oh, ho ho.


413
0:24:3,566 --> 0:24:4,38
Oh.


414
0:24:4,38 --> 0:24:7,79
That was some fancy skating
there, John Dore.


415
0:24:7,79 --> 0:24:9,145
You Canuck.


416
0:24:9,145 --> 0:24:10,45
Um.


417
0:24:10,45 --> 0:24:11,79
Well, that's how
Set List works.


418
0:24:11,79 --> 0:24:13,85
Pretty clear, eh?


419
0:24:13,85 --> 0:24:16,85
It's like weaving gold
out of lead.


420
0:24:16,85 --> 0:24:18,43
It's alchemy, what happens
here on the


421
0:24:18,43 --> 0:24:19,6
stage, ladies and gentlemen.


422
0:24:19,6 --> 0:24:20,51
And we're going to
kick it off again


423
0:24:20,51 --> 0:24:21,86
with this next gentleman.


424
0:24:21,86 --> 0:24:22,62
A Set--


425
0:24:22,62 --> 0:24:25,68
a favorite of Set List, he's
one of our UK cousins.


426
0:24:25,68 --> 0:24:28,56
Ladies and gentlemen, are you
ready for your next fearless


427
0:24:28,56 --> 0:24:29,81
Set Lister?


428
0:24:29,81 --> 0:24:31,67



429
0:24:31,67 --> 0:24:34,13
Ladies and gentlemen, the never
before seen set list of


430
0:24:34,13 --> 0:24:35,43
the brilliant Mr.
Matt Kirshen.


431
0:24:35,43 --> 0:24:40,502



432
0:24:40,502 --> 0:24:42,932
MATT KIRSHEN: Yeah.


433
0:24:42,932 --> 0:24:45,86
Yeah.


434
0:24:45,86 --> 0:24:46,8
Hey.


435
0:24:46,8 --> 0:24:49,616
Hello, the internet.


436
0:24:49,616 --> 0:24:52,24
Uh, I just want to thank you
for being here in the room.


437
0:24:52,24 --> 0:24:55,69
For those you all watching at
home, if you do choose to


438
0:24:55,69 --> 0:24:58,94
comment underneath our
video, just remember


439
0:24:58,94 --> 0:25:0,19
my mum reads them.


440
0:25:0,19 --> 0:25:2,83



441
0:25:2,83 --> 0:25:4,5
So maybe call her something
as well.


442
0:25:4,5 --> 0:25:8,52



443
0:25:8,52 --> 0:25:9,96
She'd love to be a faggot.


444
0:25:9,96 --> 0:25:10,48
She would.


445
0:25:10,48 --> 0:25:13,49
She would love--


446
0:25:13,49 --> 0:25:17,87
she's a woman in her
sixties, you know.


447
0:25:17,87 --> 0:25:20,26
No way she'd be as well-dressed
as a derogatory


448
0:25:20,26 --> 0:25:23,32
term for a gay man.


449
0:25:23,32 --> 0:25:25,81
I did one of their shows
on Monday, and eh.


450
0:25:25,81 --> 0:25:27,41
That seemed to be the go to.


451
0:25:27,41 --> 0:25:29,85
So never read the comments.


452
0:25:29,85 --> 0:25:31,1
Let's see what you got.


453
0:25:31,1 --> 0:25:36,36



454
0:25:36,36 --> 0:25:44,9
One of the things that's nice
about growing up in Europe is


455
0:25:44,9 --> 0:25:46,9
how much more fancy
things seem.


456
0:25:46,9 --> 0:25:49,75



457
0:25:49,75 --> 0:25:53,795
It's the joy of coming
to America as a Brit.


458
0:25:53,795 --> 0:25:58,11
You're like, everything just
sounds that little bit nicer.


459
0:25:58,11 --> 0:26:2,81
Is it a burning sensation
as you pee or is


460
0:26:2,81 --> 0:26:4,405
it a tingling fountain?


461
0:26:4,405 --> 0:26:8,54



462
0:26:8,54 --> 0:26:12,275
Is it a unsightly rash
or are you dappled?


463
0:26:12,275 --> 0:26:15,19



464
0:26:15,19 --> 0:26:18,95
Speckled, if you will.


465
0:26:18,95 --> 0:26:24,85
Horribly, horribly infected with
a disease that's caused


466
0:26:24,85 --> 0:26:27,28
exclusively by sticking
a part of a human in


467
0:26:27,28 --> 0:26:30,11
another part of a human--


468
0:26:30,11 --> 0:26:31,36
or koala.


469
0:26:31,36 --> 0:26:33,21



470
0:26:33,21 --> 0:26:37,25
That's the only other species I
know of that gets chlamydia.


471
0:26:37,25 --> 0:26:39,45
That is a fact.


472
0:26:39,45 --> 0:26:41,62
Most of these people are
connected to the internet.


473
0:26:41,62 --> 0:26:42,71
Check it out.


474
0:26:42,71 --> 0:26:43,91
Koala chlamydia.


475
0:26:43,91 --> 0:26:45,31
Genuine problem.


476
0:26:45,31 --> 0:26:51,29
So like to point out, nothing
to do with me.


477
0:26:51,29 --> 0:26:53,93
I don't necessarily want
that association.


478
0:26:53,93 --> 0:26:55,68
I know how Google
bombing works.


479
0:26:55,68 --> 0:26:58,65
I know it wouldn't take too much
effort for it to be the


480
0:26:58,65 --> 0:27:1,59
case that when you start typing
in my name, koala


481
0:27:1,59 --> 0:27:5,81
chlamydia is the next
thing that comes up.


482
0:27:5,81 --> 0:27:7,46
It's a the risk I'm willing
to take, the internet.


483
0:27:7,46 --> 0:27:20,61



484
0:27:20,61 --> 0:27:23,95
Here's the thing.


485
0:27:23,95 --> 0:27:25,37
If you're in prison--


486
0:27:25,37 --> 0:27:30,57
I've never been in prison, but
I imagine if I were, I would


487
0:27:30,57 --> 0:27:31,82
be kneeling a lot.


488
0:27:31,82 --> 0:27:34,415



489
0:27:34,415 --> 0:27:42,85
[APPLAUSE]


490
0:27:42,85 --> 0:27:45,16
There's very little that I
could get in [? Cajun ?].


491
0:27:45,16 --> 0:27:45,77
Maybe--


492
0:27:45,77 --> 0:27:46,54
I don't know--


493
0:27:46,54 --> 0:27:51,25
I could be a librarian, maybe.


494
0:27:51,25 --> 0:27:55,48
Teach some of the fellow
prisoners how to get through


495
0:27:55,48 --> 0:27:58,72
their prison degree.


496
0:27:58,72 --> 0:28:0,88
But we know that's not
my job's going to be.


497
0:28:0,88 --> 0:28:3,67



498
0:28:3,67 --> 0:28:9,54
I will at best--


499
0:28:9,54 --> 0:28:15,73
I would probably be on my knees
in a cell, but I'd maybe


500
0:28:15,73 --> 0:28:20,82
be able to find religion, find
faith, go to the chaplain's


501
0:28:20,82 --> 0:28:23,39
room and be on my knees there.


502
0:28:23,39 --> 0:28:24,99
I wouldn't escape it,
is what I'm saying.


503
0:28:24,99 --> 0:28:26,93
I--


504
0:28:26,93 --> 0:28:31,17
you don't want to be in prison
with a face and cheekbones of


505
0:28:31,17 --> 0:28:36,71
a choir boy, which I have
and will always have.


506
0:28:36,71 --> 0:28:39,85
I think I could be like,
seventy, gray, and balding,


507
0:28:39,85 --> 0:28:45,5
and I'll still look like a sort
of withered choir boy.


508
0:28:45,5 --> 0:28:47,27
I'll look like a choir boy
with a wasting disease.


509
0:28:47,27 --> 0:28:50,51



510
0:28:50,51 --> 0:28:51,56
Those diseases--


511
0:28:51,56 --> 0:28:54,27
it's like that genetic condition
that very few people


512
0:28:54,27 --> 0:28:58,8
have the way they look 60
from the age of 12.


513
0:28:58,8 --> 0:29:0,91
That that'll be me, age 60.


514
0:29:0,91 --> 0:29:2,87
Probably be me and
the real thing.


515
0:29:2,87 --> 0:29:5,4
We could talk together.


516
0:29:5,4 --> 0:29:7,1
And I'd be in prison
with that.


517
0:29:7,1 --> 0:29:8,49
I don't know why I'd
be in prison.


518
0:29:8,49 --> 0:29:10,305
There are very few things that
I'd be willing to do that


519
0:29:10,305 --> 0:29:13,8
would put me in prison, but--


520
0:29:13,8 --> 0:29:16,12
we've all killed a man.


521
0:29:16,12 --> 0:29:18,96
We've all done a bit
of murder, right?


522
0:29:18,96 --> 0:29:19,87
No one's watching this.


523
0:29:19,87 --> 0:29:20,77
This isn't a confession.


524
0:29:20,77 --> 0:29:22,2
Next topic.


525
0:29:22,2 --> 0:29:38,534



526
0:29:38,534 --> 0:29:40,55
There must've been,
there must've been


527
0:29:40,55 --> 0:29:41,55
some sheepish ones.


528
0:29:41,55 --> 0:29:44,25
There must've been some, like,
there must've been these some


529
0:29:44,25 --> 0:29:47,48
closet-- like, I think once
you got to the mid, mid to


530
0:29:47,48 --> 0:29:50,75
late '30s in Germany, you pretty
much-- like it's harder


531
0:29:50,75 --> 0:29:52,88
to not be a Nazi than
to be a Nazi, right?


532
0:29:52,88 --> 0:29:54,94
I think, you know, people
mostly went for


533
0:29:54,94 --> 0:29:55,88
the whole Nazi thing.


534
0:29:55,88 --> 0:29:58,73
But there's got to be a few
like at the beginning, you


535
0:29:58,73 --> 0:30:4,12
know, late '20s, early '30s,
where there'll be like one guy


536
0:30:4,12 --> 0:30:4,655
who's all proud.


537
0:30:4,655 --> 0:30:6,72
He's like, heil Hitler
and he's doing--


538
0:30:6,72 --> 0:30:7,1
I don't--


539
0:30:7,1 --> 0:30:8,84
I was about to do the mustache
but I don't think


540
0:30:8,84 --> 0:30:10,9
they did the mustache.


541
0:30:10,9 --> 0:30:13,19



542
0:30:13,19 --> 0:30:14,81
But they'd be doing like the
thing and there'd be a couple


543
0:30:14,81 --> 0:30:16,655
in the back who were
like, oh, maybe.


544
0:30:16,655 --> 0:30:21,49



545
0:30:21,49 --> 0:30:23,78
Just sneaking their way there.


546
0:30:23,78 --> 0:30:28,39
One day, one day I'll have
strength in numbers.


547
0:30:28,39 --> 0:30:31,75
For the moment I'm just
going to hate


548
0:30:31,75 --> 0:30:34,64
them lot from a distance.


549
0:30:34,64 --> 0:30:35,89
I'm going to hide
there and just--


550
0:30:35,89 --> 0:30:38,43



551
0:30:38,43 --> 0:30:42,52
it's quite adorable until you do
the full salute, isn't it?


552
0:30:42,52 --> 0:30:44,0
I never realized how lovely.


553
0:30:44,0 --> 0:30:46,26
Like until you-- like once you
full up do the whole straight


554
0:30:46,26 --> 0:30:48,49
and throw it right up then
that's like no, that's bad,


555
0:30:48,49 --> 0:30:49,74
that's unpleasant.


556
0:30:49,74 --> 0:30:50,99
But just a little
bit of the ways?


557
0:30:50,99 --> 0:30:53,702



558
0:30:53,702 --> 0:30:56,343
You know, if you go a little--
go the full way and it's full


559
0:30:56,343 --> 0:30:56,7
on heil Hitler.


560
0:30:56,7 --> 0:30:58,82
But you just go a little
bit it's like cooey.


561
0:30:58,82 --> 0:31:0,185
You know?


562
0:31:0,185 --> 0:31:3,54
Kind of adorable, it's--


563
0:31:3,54 --> 0:31:6,36
it's the way you'd, you'd
wave to, like, the


564
0:31:6,36 --> 0:31:7,61
daughter of your neighbor.


565
0:31:7,61 --> 0:31:15,11



566
0:31:15,11 --> 0:31:16,6
That's the difference.


567
0:31:16,6 --> 0:31:18,17
Just a slight flex in the
arm and a wiggle.


568
0:31:18,17 --> 0:31:18,89
That's all it takes.


569
0:31:18,89 --> 0:31:19,48
That--


570
0:31:19,48 --> 0:31:21,945
that's the difference between
genocide and adorable.


571
0:31:21,945 --> 0:31:31,35



572
0:31:31,35 --> 0:31:32,62
OK.


573
0:31:32,62 --> 0:31:35,54
You're going to have to move
it on to the next topic.


574
0:31:35,54 --> 0:31:36,8
I could bluff off this one.


575
0:31:36,8 --> 0:31:39,15
I could bullshit my way through
this one, but I did


576
0:31:39,15 --> 0:31:41,29
Set List a month ago
and that topic came


577
0:31:41,29 --> 0:31:42,45
up and I'm not cheesing.


578
0:31:42,45 --> 0:31:43,7
Next topic.


579
0:31:43,7 --> 0:31:49,558



580
0:31:49,558 --> 0:31:51,19
Can we go back a topic?


581
0:31:51,19 --> 0:32:2,11



582
0:32:2,11 --> 0:32:6,79
I was raised Jewish, and--


583
0:32:6,79 --> 0:32:7,2
no.


584
0:32:7,2 --> 0:32:7,41
I can't--


585
0:32:7,41 --> 0:32:9,415
I can't do Nazi and then
instantly going into


586
0:32:9,415 --> 0:32:10,43
anti-Semitism as well.


587
0:32:10,43 --> 0:32:13,94
I can't do that in a row.


588
0:32:13,94 --> 0:32:15,19
Really engaging.


589
0:32:15,19 --> 0:32:19,4



590
0:32:19,4 --> 0:32:20,75
It's gotta be--


591
0:32:20,75 --> 0:32:23,185
it's a bit suspicious that
we all lose our teeth.


592
0:32:23,185 --> 0:32:28,14



593
0:32:28,14 --> 0:32:30,92
It's a little bit suspicious,
isn't it?


594
0:32:30,92 --> 0:32:35,76
Supposedly it's so that bigger
teeth can grow through, but do


595
0:32:35,76 --> 0:32:37,48
we really need the
bigger teeth?


596
0:32:37,48 --> 0:32:38,866
Like I--


597
0:32:38,866 --> 0:32:40,7
I think--


598
0:32:40,7 --> 0:32:42,74
I think I would do perfectly
well with--


599
0:32:42,74 --> 0:32:45,31
I've got quite big teeth
and I don't think they


600
0:32:45,31 --> 0:32:46,32
need to be this big.


601
0:32:46,32 --> 0:32:52,41
I think if I just had the
original lot, I'd look fine.


602
0:32:52,41 --> 0:32:56,31
I don't think it's evolution
that is responsible for us


603
0:32:56,31 --> 0:32:58,67
having the second set of
teeth coming through,


604
0:32:58,67 --> 0:33:1,57
the first half leaving.


605
0:33:1,57 --> 0:33:3,65
I don't believe in God.


606
0:33:3,65 --> 0:33:6,35
I don't believe in Santa.


607
0:33:6,35 --> 0:33:10,44
But I once put a tooth under my
pillow, and when I woke up


608
0:33:10,44 --> 0:33:15,19
in the morning, that tooth was
gone and money was there.


609
0:33:15,19 --> 0:33:16,44
Explain that, science.


610
0:33:16,44 --> 0:33:20,98



611
0:33:20,98 --> 0:33:24,975
Explain that, Professor
Richard Dawkins.


612
0:33:24,975 --> 0:33:27,88
If that is your real name.


613
0:33:27,88 --> 0:33:29,16
You explain that.


614
0:33:29,16 --> 0:33:30,38
Some stuff you can't work out.


615
0:33:30,38 --> 0:33:32,12
Occam's razor.


616
0:33:32,12 --> 0:33:35,4
Likeliest solution
is the most--


617
0:33:35,4 --> 0:33:36,29
happened.


618
0:33:36,29 --> 0:33:38,61



619
0:33:38,61 --> 0:33:40,2
It's the exact wording,
including that pause.


620
0:33:40,2 --> 0:33:41,21
Go to the Oxford English
Dictionary.


621
0:33:41,21 --> 0:33:41,94
That's how it happens.


622
0:33:41,94 --> 0:33:43,72
Maybe not Webster's, maybe
not in America.


623
0:33:43,72 --> 0:33:47,2
Oxford has got that
awkward pause.


624
0:33:47,2 --> 0:33:48,93
Go to Oxford Dictionary,
that's the definition.


625
0:33:48,93 --> 0:33:49,81
Occam's razor.


626
0:33:49,81 --> 0:33:53,456
Most likely solution
is m-- happens.


627
0:33:53,456 --> 0:33:55,91
That's how we do it. 'Cause
in Britain, more adorable.


628
0:33:55,91 --> 0:33:57,11
We already proved that.


629
0:33:57,11 --> 0:33:59,57
So--


630
0:33:59,57 --> 0:34:1,16
no, what's more likely?


631
0:34:1,16 --> 0:34:3,68
That there's a genetic, there's
an evolutionary reason


632
0:34:3,68 --> 0:34:6,272
for one row of tooth-- of teeth
to leave and another row


633
0:34:6,272 --> 0:34:8,34
of teeth to grow in?


634
0:34:8,34 --> 0:34:16,67
Or that there's some weird imp,
some freakish, smaller


635
0:34:16,67 --> 0:34:20,989
than average, semi-magical
creature, that wants


636
0:34:20,989 --> 0:34:23,994
children's teeth for a reason?


637
0:34:23,994 --> 0:34:26,6



638
0:34:26,6 --> 0:34:28,2
We just tell our kids this.


639
0:34:28,2 --> 0:34:30,2
We tell our kids there's the--


640
0:34:30,2 --> 0:34:31,99
that's the-- that's
fucking horrible.


641
0:34:31,99 --> 0:34:34,1
That is a awful thing--


642
0:34:34,1 --> 0:34:34,679
I mean they--


643
0:34:34,679 --> 0:34:35,429
no, not adult teeth.


644
0:34:35,429 --> 0:34:38,9
They just want children's
teeth.


645
0:34:38,9 --> 0:34:40,739
The tooth fairy, there's only
one thing, and it specifically


646
0:34:40,739 --> 0:34:42,5
wants the teeth of children.


647
0:34:42,5 --> 0:34:44,63
Once you're over a certain
age it's teeth are of


648
0:34:44,63 --> 0:34:47,449
no interest to you.


649
0:34:47,449 --> 0:34:49,159
The children's teeth,
they do it.


650
0:34:49,159 --> 0:34:50,37
Just for a ritual.


651
0:34:50,37 --> 0:34:51,12
Just so--


652
0:34:51,12 --> 0:34:52,929
I don't actually imagine the
tooth fairy lives in some


653
0:34:52,929 --> 0:34:57,46
building this made entirely
of children's teeth.


654
0:34:57,46 --> 0:34:57,92
That's--


655
0:34:57,92 --> 0:35:1,1
I've never got that noise out
of people on stage before.


656
0:35:1,1 --> 0:35:2,52
I've been doing stand
up for a while.


657
0:35:2,52 --> 0:35:3,93
I've never said something
that has actually got


658
0:35:3,93 --> 0:35:6,64
people to go, ughhh.


659
0:35:6,64 --> 0:35:8,86
That was a visceral reaction
I got off that.


660
0:35:8,86 --> 0:35:11,9
That was as if at one point in
your childhood you actually


661
0:35:11,9 --> 0:35:14,25
went to a building that was
all children's teeth.


662
0:35:14,25 --> 0:35:16,7
And I just stirred up a
horrendous memory and now


663
0:35:16,7 --> 0:35:18,6
you're gonna have to go to
counseling and it's my fault.


664
0:35:18,6 --> 0:35:28,8



665
0:35:28,8 --> 0:35:31,2
Well, you'd have to write it
in blood, wouldn't you?


666
0:35:31,2 --> 0:35:35,19



667
0:35:35,19 --> 0:35:38,55
I guess if you were, like,
if you were a--


668
0:35:38,55 --> 0:35:44,72
if you were a graffiti artist
who was a bit sad--


669
0:35:44,72 --> 0:35:45,65
well more than a bit sad.


670
0:35:45,65 --> 0:35:47,52
You have to be very sad
to commit suicide.


671
0:35:47,52 --> 0:35:50,55
If you're a bit sad
don't commit--


672
0:35:50,55 --> 0:35:51,9
don't commit suicide anyway.


673
0:35:51,9 --> 0:35:52,36
If you're watching this
and complement--


674
0:35:52,36 --> 0:35:56,54
contemplating suicide, I mean I
shouldn't be the one to tell


675
0:35:56,54 --> 0:36:0,56
you this, but, like, get help.


676
0:36:0,56 --> 0:36:0,88
OK?


677
0:36:0,88 --> 0:36:2,44
Don't--


678
0:36:2,44 --> 0:36:6,48
I hope I've cheered
you up a bit.


679
0:36:6,48 --> 0:36:8,89
I hope I haven't stirred up a
memory of you being in a house


680
0:36:8,89 --> 0:36:12,5
of teeth and that was
the final straw.


681
0:36:12,5 --> 0:36:13,91
Go open a different tab.


682
0:36:13,91 --> 0:36:16,2
Stop watching us for a second
and go to-- there's plenty of


683
0:36:16,2 --> 0:36:18,24
help things.


684
0:36:18,24 --> 0:36:24,47
But if you do insist on
it, if you've really


685
0:36:24,47 --> 0:36:25,88
made up your mind--


686
0:36:25,88 --> 0:36:27,7
and I mean really--


687
0:36:27,7 --> 0:36:28,32
but still get help.


688
0:36:28,32 --> 0:36:33,766
But if you've really made up
your mind, make an effort.


689
0:36:33,766 --> 0:36:35,75
You know, there aren't
enough adventurous


690
0:36:35,75 --> 0:36:36,88
suicides these days.


691
0:36:36,88 --> 0:36:38,28
If you--


692
0:36:38,28 --> 0:36:41,87
draw-- draw something pretty
with the blood as you're--


693
0:36:41,87 --> 0:36:43,93
you know, you've got a limited
amount of time, so don't go


694
0:36:43,93 --> 0:36:44,78
too adventurous.


695
0:36:44,78 --> 0:36:47,16
We're not talking Sistine
Chapel here.


696
0:36:47,16 --> 0:36:51,579
Maybe something funny so when
they discover you they're


697
0:36:51,579 --> 0:36:53,82
like, ahhh-- ha ha ha.


698
0:36:53,82 --> 0:36:57,306



699
0:36:57,306 --> 0:36:59,82
Like a rabbit with a massive
cock and balls, or


700
0:36:59,82 --> 0:37:1,68
something like that.


701
0:37:1,68 --> 0:37:2,5
Just in blood.


702
0:37:2,5 --> 0:37:6,2
Just something that makes them
go, well, this is sad.


703
0:37:6,2 --> 0:37:10,36
But not as sad as it could be.


704
0:37:10,36 --> 0:37:13,68
It's what he would
have wanted.


705
0:37:13,68 --> 0:37:17,345
A final little giggle.


706
0:37:17,345 --> 0:37:19,52
And just-- and they don't call
it-- and that-- but like the


707
0:37:19,52 --> 0:37:21,36
person would hear that noise.


708
0:37:21,36 --> 0:37:22,23
They'd go like, what happened?


709
0:37:22,23 --> 0:37:22,76
What happened?


710
0:37:22,76 --> 0:37:24,58
And they'd burst in as well and
do exactly the same thing,


711
0:37:24,58 --> 0:37:26,4
one after another, including--


712
0:37:26,4 --> 0:37:27,79
and then the ambulance
guys as well.


713
0:37:27,79 --> 0:37:31,36
But they probably
seen it before.


714
0:37:31,36 --> 0:37:33,5
Listen, it's been a pleasure
talking to you.


715
0:37:33,5 --> 0:37:34,49
Enjoy the rest of your show.


716
0:37:34,49 --> 0:37:35,395
I've been Matt Kirshen.


717
0:37:35,395 --> 0:37:37,82
Thank you, the internet.


718
0:37:37,82 --> 0:37:39,7
PAUL PROVENZA: Matt Kirshen!


719
0:37:39,7 --> 0:37:42,67



720
0:37:42,67 --> 0:37:43,92
Matt Kirshen, ladies
and gentlemen.


721
0:37:43,92 --> 0:37:48,99



722
0:37:48,99 --> 0:37:52,33
Uh, and it's true what he about
koalas, by the way.


723
0:37:52,33 --> 0:37:56,33



724
0:37:56,33 --> 0:37:58,63
It's not just a cover story.


725
0:37:58,63 --> 0:37:59,556
It's true.


726
0:37:59,556 --> 0:38:2,275
Um, yeah, you guys having
a good time?


727
0:38:2,275 --> 0:38:4,82



728
0:38:4,82 --> 0:38:6,7
You folks at home?


729
0:38:6,7 --> 0:38:8,49
All of you when you get a chance
check out the Nerdist


730
0:38:8,49 --> 0:38:12,2
Channel series of Set List,
Stand-Up Without a Net.


731
0:38:12,2 --> 0:38:13,97
One going up every week.


732
0:38:13,97 --> 0:38:16,37
Just check when-- soon as you're
done watching th--


733
0:38:16,37 --> 0:38:17,3
not now.


734
0:38:17,3 --> 0:38:19,38
Fuck it.


735
0:38:19,38 --> 0:38:20,79
Let's bring out our
next fearless Set


736
0:38:20,79 --> 0:38:22,4
Lister, what do you say?


737
0:38:22,4 --> 0:38:27,7



738
0:38:27,7 --> 0:38:30,29
Ladies and gentlemen, will you
welcome the never before seen


739
0:38:30,29 --> 0:38:33,28
set list of another favorite
of ours, the brilliant Miss


740
0:38:33,28 --> 0:38:34,53
Kira Soltanovich!


741
0:38:34,53 --> 0:38:41,11



742
0:38:41,11 --> 0:38:43,1
KIRA SOLTANOVICH: Thank you.


743
0:38:43,1 --> 0:38:45,91
It's Paul Provenza,
guys, right?


744
0:38:45,91 --> 0:38:47,41
It's exciting stuff.


745
0:38:47,41 --> 0:38:48,412
Look at you.


746
0:38:48,412 --> 0:38:50,96
You got dropped off here
by an adult, right?


747
0:38:50,96 --> 0:38:52,476
Good for you!


748
0:38:52,476 --> 0:38:53,5
That's exciting!


749
0:38:53,5 --> 0:38:54,9
You're out.


750
0:38:54,9 --> 0:38:54,765
You're on a date.


751
0:38:54,765 --> 0:38:58,525
With your-- with Jude Law.


752
0:38:58,525 --> 0:39:1,34
You're going to lose your
virginity tonight.


753
0:39:1,34 --> 0:39:3,23
It's going to happen
for you, right?


754
0:39:3,23 --> 0:39:4,0
It's going to happen.


755
0:39:4,0 --> 0:39:5,54
You excited?


756
0:39:5,54 --> 0:39:5,67
OK.


757
0:39:5,67 --> 0:39:7,21
I'm excited for you.


758
0:39:7,21 --> 0:39:8,64
Can I watch?


759
0:39:8,64 --> 0:39:9,75
Is that inappropriate?


760
0:39:9,75 --> 0:39:11,63
All right.


761
0:39:11,63 --> 0:39:13,73
Hey, you guys who are watching
on the internet!


762
0:39:13,73 --> 0:39:15,18
Pull your pants up,
you perverts.


763
0:39:15,18 --> 0:39:17,68



764
0:39:17,68 --> 0:39:18,78
Nah, keep 'em down.


765
0:39:18,78 --> 0:39:19,275
It's fine.


766
0:39:19,275 --> 0:39:20,9
It's fine.


767
0:39:20,9 --> 0:39:21,49
It doesn't matter to me.


768
0:39:21,49 --> 0:39:22,8
I don't care.


769
0:39:22,8 --> 0:39:25,83
I'm just going to talk to fine
folks, youngsters over here.


770
0:39:25,83 --> 0:39:27,5
Oh, is this like
a high school?


771
0:39:27,5 --> 0:39:29,64
Did a bus drop you guys off?


772
0:39:29,64 --> 0:39:32,416
Holy cow.


773
0:39:32,416 --> 0:39:33,3
All right.


774
0:39:33,3 --> 0:39:34,41
Let's have some fun, you know?


775
0:39:34,41 --> 0:39:36,7
We're going to discuss
some things.


776
0:39:36,7 --> 0:39:38,88
A lot of them will go directly
over your head, young


777
0:39:38,88 --> 0:39:40,38
man, but it's OK.


778
0:39:40,38 --> 0:39:44,7
Whatever anyone around you is
laughing, you laugh too.


779
0:39:44,7 --> 0:39:45,19
All right?


780
0:39:45,19 --> 0:39:47,981
And you will be just fine.


781
0:39:47,981 --> 0:39:48,8
Oh, man.


782
0:39:48,8 --> 0:39:50,6
Speaking of feeling
old, right?


783
0:39:50,6 --> 0:39:55,61



784
0:39:55,61 --> 0:40:0,23
You know, I'm just a
creature of habit.


785
0:40:0,23 --> 0:40:3,46
I'm going to tell you
guys right now.


786
0:40:3,46 --> 0:40:4,35
I really am.


787
0:40:4,35 --> 0:40:5,46
Here's what it is.


788
0:40:5,46 --> 0:40:7,34
You know, you do get
set in your ways.


789
0:40:7,34 --> 0:40:8,23
You know what I mean?


790
0:40:8,23 --> 0:40:10,11
You get set in your ways.


791
0:40:10,11 --> 0:40:14,27
I was just printing up
something-- like something I


792
0:40:14,27 --> 0:40:18,2
wrote-- on my dot matrix
earlier today, and--


793
0:40:18,2 --> 0:40:20,37
it's a printer that goes
like this, [BUZZES].


794
0:40:20,37 --> 0:40:27,16



795
0:40:27,16 --> 0:40:29,103
And then after that
one line is done--


796
0:40:29,103 --> 0:40:35,19



797
0:40:35,19 --> 0:40:36,41
you don't even know what
dot matrix is.


798
0:40:36,41 --> 0:40:37,26
Do you have any idea?


799
0:40:37,26 --> 0:40:38,14
You don't know.


800
0:40:38,14 --> 0:40:40,43
Is it a shoe brand?


801
0:40:40,43 --> 0:40:43,56
Is it the new Christian
band out there?


802
0:40:43,56 --> 0:40:44,63
Is it--


803
0:40:44,63 --> 0:40:45,67
the Dot Matrix!


804
0:40:45,67 --> 0:40:47,19
Ahhhh!


805
0:40:47,19 --> 0:40:48,44
For Jesus!


806
0:40:48,44 --> 0:40:51,85



807
0:40:51,85 --> 0:40:52,21
No.


808
0:40:52,21 --> 0:40:53,75
It's a printer, all right?


809
0:40:53,75 --> 0:40:56,28



810
0:40:56,28 --> 0:40:58,9
And I'm not going to get
rid of it, all right?


811
0:40:58,9 --> 0:40:59,72
I'm not.


812
0:40:59,72 --> 0:41:5,946
With your fancy I can print
off a smartphone, wh--


813
0:41:5,946 --> 0:41:9,16
how smart is a smartphone
if you can't


814
0:41:9,16 --> 0:41:12,322
type in the word boobless?


815
0:41:12,322 --> 0:41:13,572
How smart?


816
0:41:13,572 --> 0:41:15,86



817
0:41:15,86 --> 0:41:18,95
Oh, did I just blow
your minds?


818
0:41:18,95 --> 0:41:19,59
That's right.


819
0:41:19,59 --> 0:41:21,91
You don't even know what
a pager is, do you?


820
0:41:21,91 --> 0:41:22,694
You don't even know.


821
0:41:22,694 --> 0:41:24,41
Oh, my god.


822
0:41:24,41 --> 0:41:26,89
Do you even know what
a crackhead is?


823
0:41:26,89 --> 0:41:30,908
Because that's what pagers
were used for--


824
0:41:30,908 --> 0:41:33,59
for crackheads.


825
0:41:33,59 --> 0:41:35,19
Were your parents born
in the '80s?


826
0:41:35,19 --> 0:41:38,55
How old are you,
is my question.


827
0:41:38,55 --> 0:41:38,9
I do.


828
0:41:38,9 --> 0:41:39,8
I still use one.


829
0:41:39,8 --> 0:41:40,54
I still use it.


830
0:41:40,54 --> 0:41:41,52
I'll tell you why.


831
0:41:41,52 --> 0:41:42,7
I'll tell you why.


832
0:41:42,7 --> 0:41:44,17
And it's not because I'm
a drug dealer from


833
0:41:44,17 --> 0:41:46,1
a few decades ago.


834
0:41:46,1 --> 0:41:49,185
It's because I never went
to medical school.


835
0:41:49,185 --> 0:41:52,38



836
0:41:52,38 --> 0:41:55,43
And I'm constantly waiting
for a table.


837
0:41:55,43 --> 0:42:0,1



838
0:42:0,1 --> 0:42:2,17
I figure, why not beat
'em to the punch?


839
0:42:2,17 --> 0:42:2,72
Boom.


840
0:42:2,72 --> 0:42:5,17
We'll let you know when your
table at the Cheesecake


841
0:42:5,17 --> 0:42:5,88
Factory is ready.


842
0:42:5,88 --> 0:42:7,2
I go no.


843
0:42:7,2 --> 0:42:8,27
No.


844
0:42:8,27 --> 0:42:11,26
I'll let you know.


845
0:42:11,26 --> 0:42:12,8
When this goes [BUZZ]


846
0:42:12,8 --> 0:42:15,4
boobless [BUZZ]


847
0:42:15,4 --> 0:42:16,5
I will seat myself.


848
0:42:16,5 --> 0:42:17,14
Boom.


849
0:42:17,14 --> 0:42:18,39
In your face.


850
0:42:18,39 --> 0:42:21,13



851
0:42:21,13 --> 0:42:22,42
And then I also pretend
like I have surgery.


852
0:42:22,42 --> 0:42:29,2



853
0:42:29,2 --> 0:42:31,72
Oh, goodness.


854
0:42:31,72 --> 0:42:35,95
So, uh, if you guys don't know
anything about me, Soltanovich


855
0:42:35,95 --> 0:42:37,55
is my last name, Soltanovich.


856
0:42:37,55 --> 0:42:42,91
So yes, I am a Soviet
Communist.


857
0:42:42,91 --> 0:42:43,68
Thank you.


858
0:42:43,68 --> 0:42:44,64
And uh--


859
0:42:44,64 --> 0:42:46,665
you don't even know
what that is.


860
0:42:46,665 --> 0:42:48,1
Uh, just--


861
0:42:48,1 --> 0:42:50,65
nothing in the front row is
going to [? know ?] that one.


862
0:42:50,65 --> 0:42:55,42
Um, so the first stereotype you
think of when you think of


863
0:42:55,42 --> 0:42:57,95
Russians, liquid people.


864
0:42:57,95 --> 0:42:59,83
That's right.


865
0:42:59,83 --> 0:43:0,43
That's right.


866
0:43:0,43 --> 0:43:2,67
We eat our breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.


867
0:43:2,67 --> 0:43:3,86
Guess what?


868
0:43:3,86 --> 0:43:4,67
We don't care.


869
0:43:4,67 --> 0:43:6,36
That's the stereotype that
you think about us.


870
0:43:6,36 --> 0:43:7,27
Thank you for saying hot.


871
0:43:7,27 --> 0:43:7,95
I appreciate that.


872
0:43:7,95 --> 0:43:11,1
That's also the second one.


873
0:43:11,1 --> 0:43:11,47
We are.


874
0:43:11,47 --> 0:43:13,62
We are liquid people.


875
0:43:13,62 --> 0:43:17,51
It's one of those things where
we don't like to talk about


876
0:43:17,51 --> 0:43:19,65
it, because why bring it up?


877
0:43:19,65 --> 0:43:22,39
Why talk about something
that is both fun--


878
0:43:22,39 --> 0:43:24,84
vodka--


879
0:43:24,84 --> 0:43:26,24
and destructive--


880
0:43:26,24 --> 0:43:29,35
drinking every meal?


881
0:43:29,35 --> 0:43:32,34
We don't bring it up.


882
0:43:32,34 --> 0:43:35,88
We don't want to be judged
by you, or you.


883
0:43:35,88 --> 0:43:36,79
Everyone else is cool.


884
0:43:36,79 --> 0:43:40,6
I don't mind if anyone else
judges us, just not this boy


885
0:43:40,6 --> 0:43:42,49
band in the front row.


886
0:43:42,49 --> 0:43:43,83
They're making me very uneasy.


887
0:43:43,83 --> 0:43:46,435



888
0:43:46,435 --> 0:43:47,58
But it's true.


889
0:43:47,58 --> 0:43:48,432
It's true.


890
0:43:48,432 --> 0:43:50,77
Hey, are Asian people
bad drivers?


891
0:43:50,77 --> 0:43:53,7
Not all of them, come on.


892
0:43:53,7 --> 0:43:54,6
Not all of them.


893
0:43:54,6 --> 0:43:55,63
When they're doing math
while driving,


894
0:43:55,63 --> 0:43:56,89
yes, that's very dangerous.


895
0:43:56,89 --> 0:44:0,2



896
0:44:0,2 --> 0:44:2,56
Do all Mexicans have
lawnmowers?


897
0:44:2,56 --> 0:44:4,0
I don't know.


898
0:44:4,0 --> 0:44:7,384
I don't hang out
with Mexicans.


899
0:44:7,384 --> 0:44:10,33
Are all Russians
liquid people?


900
0:44:10,33 --> 0:44:12,35
Yes.


901
0:44:12,35 --> 0:44:14,94
Yes, we are.


902
0:44:14,94 --> 0:44:17,51
And we're not ashamed of it.


903
0:44:17,51 --> 0:44:20,22
Or of our pagers.


904
0:44:20,22 --> 0:44:22,3
I'm not going to be ashamed
of a pager, everybody.


905
0:44:22,3 --> 0:44:24,48
I'm not going-- you're not
going to shame me.


906
0:44:24,48 --> 0:44:28,773



907
0:44:28,773 --> 0:44:30,98
Oh, if I could impart
any kind of wisdom


908
0:44:30,98 --> 0:44:34,41
on you young people--


909
0:44:34,41 --> 0:44:37,34
you young, young people-- first
thing I would do is take


910
0:44:37,34 --> 0:44:40,18
out your smartphone and
Google Lionel Richie.


911
0:44:40,18 --> 0:44:43,46



912
0:44:43,46 --> 0:44:46,18
'Cause you don't know
who that is.


913
0:44:46,18 --> 0:44:48,53
If I could impart-- seriously,
I'm being serious right now--


914
0:44:48,53 --> 0:44:51,46
let's just really get
down to brass tacks,


915
0:44:51,46 --> 0:44:52,42
as they say, right?


916
0:44:52,42 --> 0:44:53,67
Which is a new band.


917
0:44:53,67 --> 0:44:56,3



918
0:44:56,3 --> 0:44:59,27
We sometimes in life-- you know
what I mean-- you come to


919
0:44:59,27 --> 0:45:1,21
a fork in the road.


920
0:45:1,21 --> 0:45:3,1
It zigs when you want to zag.


921
0:45:3,1 --> 0:45:4,16
Which way do I go?


922
0:45:4,16 --> 0:45:5,5
What do I do?


923
0:45:5,5 --> 0:45:7,61
Do I finish junior high?


924
0:45:7,61 --> 0:45:8,92
Go to DeVry?


925
0:45:8,92 --> 0:45:10,425
What-- what do I?


926
0:45:10,425 --> 0:45:12,5
Change my liquid every meal?


927
0:45:12,5 --> 0:45:13,61
What do I do?


928
0:45:13,61 --> 0:45:17,12
And if you don't believe in a
higher power, you know what I


929
0:45:17,12 --> 0:45:19,57
mean, and if no one on Facebook
is giving you good


930
0:45:19,57 --> 0:45:24,61
advice, do what I
do, you guys.


931
0:45:24,61 --> 0:45:26,29
And I have lived by this.


932
0:45:26,29 --> 0:45:29,59
And I have lived a very
fulful-- fulfil--


933
0:45:29,59 --> 0:45:32,43
I don't want to even say
the word because it's


934
0:45:32,43 --> 0:45:34,29
that full of fill.


935
0:45:34,29 --> 0:45:37,242
It's a very fulfilled life.


936
0:45:37,242 --> 0:45:40,72
It's fulfilling out
of my face.


937
0:45:40,72 --> 0:45:41,4
Alliteration.


938
0:45:41,4 --> 0:45:41,68
Boom.


939
0:45:41,68 --> 0:45:44,54
You try it.


940
0:45:44,54 --> 0:45:46,97
Here's what I do when I
get stuck and I say,


941
0:45:46,97 --> 0:45:48,13
god, what do I do?


942
0:45:48,13 --> 0:45:51,72
Please, universe out there?


943
0:45:51,72 --> 0:45:53,29
And it's always the
same thing.


944
0:45:53,29 --> 0:45:58,3
It is always the same thing.


945
0:45:58,3 --> 0:45:59,28
Dancing on the ceiling.


946
0:45:59,28 --> 0:46:2,601



947
0:46:2,601 --> 0:46:4,2
Think about it.


948
0:46:4,2 --> 0:46:6,52



949
0:46:6,52 --> 0:46:7,46
It's all you have to do.


950
0:46:7,46 --> 0:46:10,95
Just look up to that ceiling
and you dance on it.


951
0:46:10,95 --> 0:46:11,73
Look him up.


952
0:46:11,73 --> 0:46:12,49
Wikipedia.


953
0:46:12,49 --> 0:46:13,2
Thank you so much.


954
0:46:13,2 --> 0:46:15,342
My name's Kira Soltanovich.


955
0:46:15,342 --> 0:46:16,592
PAUL PROVENZA: Kira
Soltanovich!


956
0:46:16,592 --> 0:46:21,27



957
0:46:21,27 --> 0:46:22,52
Kira Soltanovich.


958
0:46:22,52 --> 0:46:26,72



959
0:46:26,72 --> 0:46:29,76
Folks, this is a nice time to
give a big round of applause


960
0:46:29,76 --> 0:46:32,49
to the evil genius creator and
the man behind the Set List,


961
0:46:32,49 --> 0:46:33,74
Mr. Troy Conrad.


962
0:46:33,74 --> 0:46:40,79



963
0:46:40,79 --> 0:46:43,96
And I'm anxious to see this next
journey we're going to go


964
0:46:43,96 --> 0:46:46,3
on, ladies and gentlemen,
because this tour guide takes


965
0:46:46,3 --> 0:46:47,73
us to places we don't
often go.


966
0:46:47,73 --> 0:46:50,1
Ladies and gentlemen, are you
ready for your next fearless


967
0:46:50,1 --> 0:46:52,85
Set Lister?


968
0:46:52,85 --> 0:46:54,86
Give it up for the never before
seen set list of Mr.


969
0:46:54,86 --> 0:46:56,11
Moshe Kasher!


970
0:46:56,11 --> 0:47:2,12



971
0:47:2,12 --> 0:47:3,59
MOSHE KASHER: All right,
all right.


972
0:47:3,59 --> 0:47:4,57
OK.


973
0:47:4,57 --> 0:47:7,45
It's been pretty good
so far, huh?


974
0:47:7,45 --> 0:47:8,22
Yeah.


975
0:47:8,22 --> 0:47:11,17
I'm about to take a shit
on that right now.


976
0:47:11,17 --> 0:47:14,0
I don't know, straight up don't
know, I straight up


977
0:47:14,0 --> 0:47:15,704
can't do this.


978
0:47:15,704 --> 0:47:17,55
I just fucking can't do it.


979
0:47:17,55 --> 0:47:18,57
In the back I heard them.


980
0:47:18,57 --> 0:47:19,11
They were talking.


981
0:47:19,11 --> 0:47:21,7
They were like, we're running
a little low on time.


982
0:47:21,7 --> 0:47:22,46
Make 'em go quicker.


983
0:47:22,46 --> 0:47:23,95
This is the fucking internet.


984
0:47:23,95 --> 0:47:25,5
Why-- there's nothing--


985
0:47:25,5 --> 0:47:28,49
is something else happening
afterwards?


986
0:47:28,49 --> 0:47:30,72
Is there a live stream of "Two
Girls, One Cup" we're


987
0:47:30,72 --> 0:47:31,68
about to get into?


988
0:47:31,68 --> 0:47:35,495
I think we'll be OK if we go a
little long on the internet.


989
0:47:35,495 --> 0:47:38,145
You know, the place where they
store all of the information?


990
0:47:38,145 --> 0:47:47,26



991
0:47:47,26 --> 0:47:51,81
Sometimes I write jokes that I
find disrespectful myself.


992
0:47:51,81 --> 0:47:55,94
The very topic of my own joke
I find to be offensive.


993
0:47:55,94 --> 0:47:58,69
I wrote a joke about this when
I was younger, when I had a


994
0:47:58,69 --> 0:48:1,56
less nuanced idea
of sexuality.


995
0:48:1,56 --> 0:48:3,93
I thought oh, it'd be funny if
I wrote a long joke about how


996
0:48:3,93 --> 0:48:6,57
I fuck old-ass people--


997
0:48:6,57 --> 0:48:9,36
brittle-ass hips,
popping bones--


998
0:48:9,36 --> 0:48:10,9
from the streets.


999
0:48:10,9 --> 0:48:10,95
I'm a straight up gangster.


1000
0:48:10,95 --> 0:48:12,59
I'm a Crip.


1001
0:48:12,59 --> 0:48:13,28
What's up?


1002
0:48:13,28 --> 0:48:15,22
What's up?


1003
0:48:15,22 --> 0:48:15,68
Find me.


1004
0:48:15,68 --> 0:48:20,74
YouTube.com/anonymous.


1005
0:48:20,74 --> 0:48:23,73
So I wrote this long bit about
how I sleep with old people so


1006
0:48:23,73 --> 0:48:24,45
that you don't have to.


1007
0:48:24,45 --> 0:48:26,7
But then I started
doing it for real


1008
0:48:26,7 --> 0:48:27,12
because what would happen--


1009
0:48:27,12 --> 0:48:30,0
I started off comedy
like, 1920, 1922.


1010
0:48:30,0 --> 0:48:31,58
I was basically the
first dude.


1011
0:48:31,58 --> 0:48:33,5
It was me, it was Mel--


1012
0:48:33,5 --> 0:48:37,1
Mel B-- we called him Mel
B back then, Mel Brooks.


1013
0:48:37,1 --> 0:48:39,7
It was Sammy Davis, Jr. We
didn't like him because of--


1014
0:48:39,7 --> 0:48:40,123
you know.


1015
0:48:40,123 --> 0:48:42,14
And--


1016
0:48:42,14 --> 0:48:43,23
because of the lazy eye.


1017
0:48:43,23 --> 0:48:45,96
What was happening for
you guys in that?


1018
0:48:45,96 --> 0:48:47,23
Anyway, I was the young dude.


1019
0:48:47,23 --> 0:48:50,44
They call me the young cat,
the Crip of comedy.


1020
0:48:50,44 --> 0:48:53,14
The Crips had started
at that point, 1922.


1021
0:48:53,14 --> 0:48:56,0
And I started doing my big
closer, which was I sleep with


1022
0:48:56,0 --> 0:48:56,78
the elderly.


1023
0:48:56,78 --> 0:48:58,85
And then I-- and then I'd go
like this and everybody would


1024
0:48:58,85 --> 0:49:0,68
say, so that you
don't have to.


1025
0:49:0,68 --> 0:49:1,85
And I'd be like, that's
my time, y'all.


1026
0:49:1,85 --> 0:49:3,1
And then I'd just ejaculate.


1027
0:49:3,1 --> 0:49:5,21



1028
0:49:5,21 --> 0:49:7,4
That was what comedy was
like before all those


1029
0:49:7,4 --> 0:49:8,61
standards and practices.


1030
0:49:8,61 --> 0:49:10,2
That's why we're getting
back to the internet.


1031
0:49:10,2 --> 0:49:12,35
I first started comedy on
the internet in 1922.


1032
0:49:12,35 --> 0:49:13,83
Here's the point.


1033
0:49:13,83 --> 0:49:16,49
What ended up happening was as
a result of my big closer--


1034
0:49:16,49 --> 0:49:18,79
I sleep with the elderly so that
you don't have to-- after


1035
0:49:18,79 --> 0:49:21,8
the show I would just be lined
up, just like the guy-- just


1036
0:49:21,8 --> 0:49:23,66
like lines of just
senior citizens.


1037
0:49:23,66 --> 0:49:26,56
I mean straight up cr--
people-- dialysis,


1038
0:49:26,56 --> 0:49:27,49
they were just like.


1039
0:49:27,49 --> 0:49:28,4
You know what I mean?


1040
0:49:28,4 --> 0:49:29,73
They were just like,
one favor. .


1041
0:49:29,73 --> 0:49:31,75
Just pound it out before I go.


1042
0:49:31,75 --> 0:49:32,62
You know what I mean?


1043
0:49:32,62 --> 0:49:34,52
Pound it out before I go.


1044
0:49:34,52 --> 0:49:35,42
That's what they would say.


1045
0:49:35,42 --> 0:49:38,52
They were very weird
old people.


1046
0:49:38,52 --> 0:49:39,52
And so I would.


1047
0:49:39,52 --> 0:49:40,23
I would do that.


1048
0:49:40,23 --> 0:49:42,64
I started to-- slowly, over the
time, over the course of


1049
0:49:42,64 --> 0:49:43,42
my comedy career--


1050
0:49:43,42 --> 0:49:46,66
I started to just knock boots
with many an old person.


1051
0:49:46,66 --> 0:49:49,3
And I started to realize
the flaw in my very--


1052
0:49:49,3 --> 0:49:52,32
in my own joke, which is that I
don't sleep with the elderly


1053
0:49:52,32 --> 0:49:53,31
so you don't have to.


1054
0:49:53,31 --> 0:49:55,64
I sleep with the elderly
so that I can.


1055
0:49:55,64 --> 0:49:56,99
It's the best.


1056
0:49:56,99 --> 0:49:59,28
It's better than-- what do you
want a young woman for?


1057
0:49:59,28 --> 0:50:0,13
[INAUDIBLE]


1058
0:50:0,13 --> 0:50:1,51
I fuck women, surprise.


1059
0:50:1,51 --> 0:50:2,49
What do you-- you know
what I mean?


1060
0:50:2,49 --> 0:50:4,3
Like, what do I want
a young woman for?


1061
0:50:4,3 --> 0:50:6,54
Bad conversation and,
like, perfect body?


1062
0:50:6,54 --> 0:50:7,78
No thanks.


1063
0:50:7,78 --> 0:50:8,37
I want some--


1064
0:50:8,37 --> 0:50:9,5
I want some leather.


1065
0:50:9,5 --> 0:50:11,67
You know what I mean?


1066
0:50:11,67 --> 0:50:12,58
I want to slide--


1067
0:50:12,58 --> 0:50:15,11
I want to pull it around
myself like a lap band.


1068
0:50:15,11 --> 0:50:18,23



1069
0:50:18,23 --> 0:50:20,55
I sleep with the elderly
because I can.


1070
0:50:20,55 --> 0:50:23,198



1071
0:50:23,198 --> 0:50:24,448
Yeah.


1072
0:50:24,448 --> 0:50:29,89



1073
0:50:29,89 --> 0:50:31,85
Yeah, there's a lot of people
that are going to have a lot


1074
0:50:31,85 --> 0:50:34,15
of explaining to do when they
get up-- first of all, Jesus.


1075
0:50:34,15 --> 0:50:34,94
I'm a Jew.


1076
0:50:34,94 --> 0:50:35,62
Not real.


1077
0:50:35,62 --> 0:50:36,87
But--


1078
0:50:36,87 --> 0:50:39,32



1079
0:50:39,32 --> 0:50:40,1
no, he's real.


1080
0:50:40,1 --> 0:50:41,85
He's just--


1081
0:50:41,85 --> 0:50:45,3
a really real great guy.


1082
0:50:45,3 --> 0:50:45,93
No, I'm just--


1083
0:50:45,93 --> 0:50:47,5
I'm sure, I'm sure
he's up there.


1084
0:50:47,5 --> 0:50:49,32
I'm sure he's got a beard and
he's going to be all floating


1085
0:50:49,32 --> 0:50:50,18
when-- you know what I mean?


1086
0:50:50,18 --> 0:50:52,26
He's going to be like, hello,
and welcome to heaven.


1087
0:50:52,26 --> 0:50:54,22
You'll be like, uh, Jesus, why
do you sound like a ghost?


1088
0:50:54,22 --> 0:50:56,98
He's like, I always
have been a ghost.


1089
0:50:56,98 --> 0:50:59,39
And then he'll pull off is own
face and it'll be like the--


1090
0:50:59,39 --> 0:51:0,19
it'll be the father--


1091
0:51:0,19 --> 0:51:1,83
God, the Father, and he'll pull
it off again and it'll be


1092
0:51:1,83 --> 0:51:3,87
God, the son, and he'll pull it
off again and it'll be the


1093
0:51:3,87 --> 0:51:4,41
Holy Ghost.


1094
0:51:4,41 --> 0:51:5,61
Holy Ghost, get it?


1095
0:51:5,61 --> 0:51:6,3
A ha ha ha.


1096
0:51:6,3 --> 0:51:9,85
And then it'll be like, you
laugh like the Count and he'll


1097
0:51:9,85 --> 0:51:10,35
be like, I'm also the Count.


1098
0:51:10,35 --> 0:51:11,32
I am all things.


1099
0:51:11,32 --> 0:51:12,836
All things are possible
for me.


1100
0:51:12,836 --> 0:51:14,37
No one gets to heaven
but by me.


1101
0:51:14,37 --> 0:51:15,66
And I'd be like, I'm Jewish.


1102
0:51:15,66 --> 0:51:16,72
And he'd be like, me too.


1103
0:51:16,72 --> 0:51:18,82
The point--


1104
0:51:18,82 --> 0:51:24,1
the point is, if Jesus is
standing at the pearly gates


1105
0:51:24,1 --> 0:51:26,17
or whatever, and people
get up there,


1106
0:51:26,17 --> 0:51:27,13
there's a lot of people--


1107
0:51:27,13 --> 0:51:29,48
I'm on Twitter, @moshekasher,
please follow me--


1108
0:51:29,48 --> 0:51:32,5
and there's a lot of people
who're going to have a lot of


1109
0:51:32,5 --> 0:51:33,3
explaining to do.


1110
0:51:33,3 --> 0:51:34,73
A lot of you YouTube people
are going to have a lot of


1111
0:51:34,73 --> 0:51:35,51
explaining to do.


1112
0:51:35,51 --> 0:51:36,17
You know what I mean?


1113
0:51:36,17 --> 0:51:39,11
We go to church on Sunday, but
then you log onto the internet


1114
0:51:39,11 --> 0:51:40,41
and bully some kid--


1115
0:51:40,41 --> 0:51:42,76
you know what I mean-- maybe
some kid who's maybe 33 years


1116
0:51:42,76 --> 0:51:44,89
old and trying his best to
make a career at stand up


1117
0:51:44,89 --> 0:51:46,2
comedy that doesn't need
these negative


1118
0:51:46,2 --> 0:51:48,74
comments all the time.


1119
0:51:48,74 --> 0:51:50,91
You're going to have to explain
your maker, Jesus--


1120
0:51:50,91 --> 0:51:52,16
the magic man--


1121
0:51:52,16 --> 0:51:56,26



1122
0:51:56,26 --> 0:51:58,98
why you say I look like Buddy
Holly, why you say I look like


1123
0:51:58,98 --> 0:52:1,54
Harry Potter, why you say I look
like every white person


1124
0:52:1,54 --> 0:52:2,985
with glasses that has
ever existed.


1125
0:52:2,985 --> 0:52:9,82



1126
0:52:9,82 --> 0:52:13,93
And then Jesus will be like,
have you met Rob Delaney?


1127
0:52:13,93 --> 0:52:14,81
I love that guy.


1128
0:52:14,81 --> 0:52:17,362
Great jokes.


1129
0:52:17,362 --> 0:52:21,75
And then I'll be like,
yeah, I met him.


1130
0:52:21,75 --> 0:52:25,17
He was the main bully on Twitter
this whole time.


1131
0:52:25,17 --> 0:52:34,79



1132
0:52:34,79 --> 0:52:37,938
I'm into some freaky
shit, right?


1133
0:52:37,938 --> 0:52:38,75
No, I am.


1134
0:52:38,75 --> 0:52:39,3
But I'm not--


1135
0:52:39,3 --> 0:52:40,35
I'm not, I'm not the best.


1136
0:52:40,35 --> 0:52:41,21
I mean, I'm--


1137
0:52:41,21 --> 0:52:43,58
I'm the best stand up comedian
you'll ever see, obviously.


1138
0:52:43,58 --> 0:52:46,25



1139
0:52:46,25 --> 0:52:47,997
Thank you so much, guys.


1140
0:52:47,997 --> 0:52:50,86



1141
0:52:50,86 --> 0:52:52,62
But I'm not the best at S&M.


1142
0:52:52,62 --> 0:52:53,69
I didn't invent the shit.


1143
0:52:53,69 --> 0:52:55,13
You know what I mean?


1144
0:52:55,13 --> 0:52:57,22
I'm an amateur at best.


1145
0:52:57,22 --> 0:53:0,41
Every year there's the AVN in
Las Vegas, where they-- they


1146
0:53:0,41 --> 0:53:2,46
honor all the best pornographers
in the world and


1147
0:53:2,46 --> 0:53:3,93
they give awards away for
things like that.


1148
0:53:3,93 --> 0:53:5,17
I've won many an award--


1149
0:53:5,17 --> 0:53:10,33
the best lap band act out,
I won that award--


1150
0:53:10,33 --> 0:53:11,72
but not everybody knows this.


1151
0:53:11,72 --> 0:53:14,42
That's the hotels in Las Vegas--
the AVN pornography


1152
0:53:14,42 --> 0:53:16,29
awards-- if you go to that--
the AVN awards--


1153
0:53:16,29 --> 0:53:18,15
you take the elevator to the
basement and then you walk


1154
0:53:18,15 --> 0:53:19,14
down five more flights.


1155
0:53:19,14 --> 0:53:22,35
In the dungeon of the AVN
awards is the dungeon


1156
0:53:22,35 --> 0:53:23,735
captivity awards.


1157
0:53:23,735 --> 0:53:25,89
Now, some of the first winners
of this were of course the


1158
0:53:25,89 --> 0:53:27,5
Spanish, for the Spanish
Inquisition.


1159
0:53:27,5 --> 0:53:29,97
They won a lot of great
awards for that.


1160
0:53:29,97 --> 0:53:32,28
There was course the "Goodbye
Horses" guy.


1161
0:53:32,28 --> 0:53:34,95
Tuck your dick between your
legs, that was his move.


1162
0:53:34,95 --> 0:53:36,63
"Goodbye Horses," that
was an improv.


1163
0:53:36,63 --> 0:53:38,38
That was-- he was
doing Set List.


1164
0:53:38,38 --> 0:53:39,18
I'm serious.


1165
0:53:39,18 --> 0:53:41,31
The "Goodbye Horses" guy, this
was straight up-- it just said


1166
0:53:41,31 --> 0:53:42,44
fucking do some freaky shit.


1167
0:53:42,44 --> 0:53:44,84
And he just tucked and
he went for it.


1168
0:53:44,84 --> 0:53:46,28
That guy was the first winner.


1169
0:53:46,28 --> 0:53:48,91



1170
0:53:48,91 --> 0:53:52,25
Now, I did win an award one
time for spooling thread


1171
0:53:52,25 --> 0:53:53,81
around my own balls for
more than a week,


1172
0:53:53,81 --> 0:53:55,12
but that was an accident.


1173
0:53:55,12 --> 0:53:57,29
People thought I was doing it as
a performance piece because


1174
0:53:57,29 --> 0:54:0,46
I did film it, of course, and
live stream it on [? Josh. ?]


1175
0:54:0,46 --> 0:54:2,26
But no, that was just
an accident.


1176
0:54:2,26 --> 0:54:3,95
I won an amateur award.


1177
0:54:3,95 --> 0:54:5,98
But the greatest winner, of
course, of all time--


1178
0:54:5,98 --> 0:54:9,67
the greatest dungeon captivity
winner of all time--


1179
0:54:9,67 --> 0:54:12,16
do you guys know who it was?


1180
0:54:12,16 --> 0:54:13,56
It was the last dude.


1181
0:54:13,56 --> 0:54:15,49
It was the dude you have
to explain Twitter to.


1182
0:54:15,49 --> 0:54:18,733
It was that Jesus dude for his
wonderful trick, stay in a


1183
0:54:18,733 --> 0:54:21,11
cave for three days, float up to
heaven, come back down, and


1184
0:54:21,11 --> 0:54:24,7
change the world.


1185
0:54:24,7 --> 0:54:25,32
That was Jesus.


1186
0:54:25,32 --> 0:54:31,45



1187
0:54:31,45 --> 0:54:34,36
[LAUGHS]


1188
0:54:34,36 --> 0:54:35,58
I mean, it's the
old dichotomy.


1189
0:54:35,58 --> 0:54:36,975
It's the old pussy-dick
dichotomy,


1190
0:54:36,975 --> 0:54:39,7
you know what I mean?


1191
0:54:39,7 --> 0:54:40,41
Which way do you go, you
know what I mean?


1192
0:54:40,41 --> 0:54:40,86
Like, sir.


1193
0:54:40,86 --> 0:54:42,56
You seem like a dude that has
fucked a hermaphrodite or two


1194
0:54:42,56 --> 0:54:43,13
in your day.


1195
0:54:43,13 --> 0:54:45,2
Like--


1196
0:54:45,2 --> 0:54:45,68
no, I'm saying.


1197
0:54:45,68 --> 0:54:46,93
When you go out to-- let's
say you're a herm--


1198
0:54:46,93 --> 0:54:48,63
OK, so most some hermaphrodites
have made a


1199
0:54:48,63 --> 0:54:49,27
choice, right?


1200
0:54:49,27 --> 0:54:49,88
Or not a choice.


1201
0:54:49,88 --> 0:54:50,44
It's not a choice.


1202
0:54:50,44 --> 0:54:50,91
There's no choice.


1203
0:54:50,91 --> 0:54:51,32
But you're--


1204
0:54:51,32 --> 0:54:53,3
most hermaphrodites do
identify with gender.


1205
0:54:53,3 --> 0:54:54,96
But as we all know, gender
is mostly a myth.


1206
0:54:54,96 --> 0:54:56,86
So let's say you're a person
that's really straight down


1207
0:54:56,86 --> 0:54:57,6
the middle, know what I mean?


1208
0:54:57,6 --> 0:55:0,42
Maybe you are person that has
not decided male or female,


1209
0:55:0,42 --> 0:55:2,49
but you've got a-- you've got
maybe-- you've got a Moshe


1210
0:55:2,49 --> 0:55:4,51
Kasher sized dick, you know what
I mean, and you've got a


1211
0:55:4,51 --> 0:55:6,2
real nice tight teenage pussy.


1212
0:55:6,2 --> 0:55:7,34
And you have to make--


1213
0:55:7,34 --> 0:55:8,24
come on, guys, go with it.


1214
0:55:8,24 --> 0:55:9,6
It's the internet.


1215
0:55:9,6 --> 0:55:10,51
And you guys--


1216
0:55:10,51 --> 0:55:11,6
you've got to make a decision.


1217
0:55:11,6 --> 0:55:13,69
Tonight am I going to
get fucked or fuck?


1218
0:55:13,69 --> 0:55:14,16
But you know what?


1219
0:55:14,16 --> 0:55:14,87
Here's the deal.


1220
0:55:14,87 --> 0:55:15,97
Here's the field.


1221
0:55:15,97 --> 0:55:16,78
Here's the seal.


1222
0:55:16,78 --> 0:55:18,61
Here's the Seal, "Kissed
By A Rose." I've


1223
0:55:18,61 --> 0:55:21,59
been kissed by a rose.


1224
0:55:21,59 --> 0:55:24,475
As we all know-- as we all know,
except for the people on


1225
0:55:24,475 --> 0:55:26,29
the internet who've never
experienced the touch of


1226
0:55:26,29 --> 0:55:31,25
another's-- of a lover, that
at times it's difficult.


1227
0:55:31,25 --> 0:55:32,71
At times it's not worth
the effort.


1228
0:55:32,71 --> 0:55:33,45
You got out to the club.


1229
0:55:33,45 --> 0:55:34,14
You meet somebody.


1230
0:55:34,14 --> 0:55:35,55
You meet the pr-- you
go to the club.


1231
0:55:35,55 --> 0:55:35,99
You know the club.


1232
0:55:35,99 --> 0:55:37,15
We all go to da club, right?


1233
0:55:37,15 --> 0:55:38,3
We all do that, right?


1234
0:55:38,3 --> 0:55:38,46
Strikes?


1235
0:55:38,46 --> 0:55:38,78
OK.


1236
0:55:38,78 --> 0:55:40,93
The point is, you go out.


1237
0:55:40,93 --> 0:55:41,61
You meet somebody.


1238
0:55:41,61 --> 0:55:43,93
You have to engage in boring
conversation then you bring


1239
0:55:43,93 --> 0:55:46,34
them home and you guys-- you
guys rut like little animals.


1240
0:55:46,34 --> 0:55:48,8
And you come and you're like,
fuck, you're still here?


1241
0:55:48,8 --> 0:55:49,45
You know what I mean?


1242
0:55:49,45 --> 0:55:52,14
Sometimes it's not
worth the effort.


1243
0:55:52,14 --> 0:55:53,84
There's no tough hermaphrodite
decision.


1244
0:55:53,84 --> 0:55:56,26
You stay home, wrap
into yourself,


1245
0:55:56,26 --> 0:55:57,8
close the deal on yourself.


1246
0:55:57,8 --> 0:55:59,77
It's the greatest thing
anyone could do.


1247
0:55:59,77 --> 0:56:0,7
Don't oh.


1248
0:56:0,7 --> 0:56:1,68
Think, I wish.


1249
0:56:1,68 --> 0:56:3,56
I wish that could be me.


1250
0:56:3,56 --> 0:56:4,44
I truly do.


1251
0:56:4,44 --> 0:56:6,67
I wish you all could've
experienced what it was like


1252
0:56:6,67 --> 0:56:8,67
to perform for you because
it was a really great.


1253
0:56:8,67 --> 0:56:9,75
Thank you guys very much.


1254
0:56:9,75 --> 0:56:10,994
I'm Moshe Kasher.


1255
0:56:10,994 --> 0:56:12,455
Good night.


1256
0:56:12,455 --> 0:56:13,705
PAUL PROVENZA: Moshe Kasher!


1257
0:56:13,705 --> 0:56:16,85



1258
0:56:16,85 --> 0:56:18,1
Wow.


1259
0:56:18,1 --> 0:56:20,31



1260
0:56:20,31 --> 0:56:22,576
That was fun.


1261
0:56:22,576 --> 0:56:25,67
Folks, if any of you watching
out there are in Montreal or


1262
0:56:25,67 --> 0:56:27,94
Chicago, we'll be at Just for
Laughs festivals, we'll be at


1263
0:56:27,94 --> 0:56:29,89
the Edinburgh Fringe Festival
in Scotland.


1264
0:56:29,89 --> 0:56:31,7
Come see Set List Live.


1265
0:56:31,7 --> 0:56:32,24
And this is really exciting.


1266
0:56:32,24 --> 0:56:35,1
We always have people drop in
unexpectedly to do Set List


1267
0:56:35,1 --> 0:56:38,75
and we have a very special
treat just stopped in.


1268
0:56:38,75 --> 0:56:39,64
We're-- this is so exciting.


1269
0:56:39,64 --> 0:56:41,33
Ladies and gentlemen, are you
ready for your next fearless


1270
0:56:41,33 --> 0:56:41,81
Set Lister?


1271
0:56:41,81 --> 0:56:43,614
Are you ready for your next
fearless Set Lister?


1272
0:56:43,614 --> 0:56:46,215
Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome
the never before seen


1273
0:56:46,215 --> 0:56:48,8
set list of Mark Wahlberg!


1274
0:56:48,8 --> 0:57:9,3



1275
0:57:9,3 --> 0:57:9,89
DAN VAN KIRK: How
you guys doin'?


1276
0:57:9,89 --> 0:57:11,14
You guys doin' good?


1277
0:57:11,14 --> 0:57:16,51



1278
0:57:16,51 --> 0:57:18,56
How you doin'?


1279
0:57:18,56 --> 0:57:19,81
I like the way you look, OK?


1280
0:57:19,81 --> 0:57:23,27



1281
0:57:23,27 --> 0:57:25,87
You guys like my Voss bottle?


1282
0:57:25,87 --> 0:57:28,22
Celebrity edition.


1283
0:57:28,22 --> 0:57:31,21
You can't buy this.


1284
0:57:31,21 --> 0:57:32,46
It has to be given to you.


1285
0:57:32,46 --> 0:57:37,64



1286
0:57:37,64 --> 0:57:39,36
I was like, hey,
you know what?


1287
0:57:39,36 --> 0:57:41,844
I'm a movie star.


1288
0:57:41,844 --> 0:57:43,62
But I can do comedy too, OK?


1289
0:57:43,62 --> 0:57:46,62



1290
0:57:46,62 --> 0:57:47,87
Did you guys see "Ted"?


1291
0:57:47,87 --> 0:57:50,27



1292
0:57:50,27 --> 0:57:53,63
I destroyed that
fucking movie.


1293
0:57:53,63 --> 0:57:56,3
Did you guys see "Pain
and Gain"?


1294
0:57:56,3 --> 0:57:59,97
I let The Rock be in
that fucking movie.


1295
0:57:59,97 --> 0:58:1,4
He was like, Mark, can I
be in a movie with you?


1296
0:58:1,4 --> 0:58:4,25
I'm like, yes you can, Rock.


1297
0:58:4,25 --> 0:58:5,45
But you're going to stand
behind me the


1298
0:58:5,45 --> 0:58:6,7
whole fucking time.


1299
0:58:6,7 --> 0:58:9,626



1300
0:58:9,626 --> 0:58:10,876
He did.


1301
0:58:10,876 --> 0:58:13,94



1302
0:58:13,94 --> 0:58:17,25
You guys ready to do this?


1303
0:58:17,25 --> 0:58:18,5
You're welcome.


1304
0:58:18,5 --> 0:58:23,41



1305
0:58:23,41 --> 0:58:25,348
You guys ever feel like things
were made for you?


1306
0:58:25,348 --> 0:58:32,518



1307
0:58:32,518 --> 0:58:36,9
You know, you go into a house
and you're like, I could buy


1308
0:58:36,9 --> 0:58:38,2
this house.


1309
0:58:38,2 --> 0:58:41,56
Or you put on a pair of shoes
and you're like, did they make


1310
0:58:41,56 --> 0:58:44,3
these shoes for me?


1311
0:58:44,3 --> 0:58:46,665
That's how I feel about
reflections.


1312
0:58:46,665 --> 0:58:51,11



1313
0:58:51,11 --> 0:58:54,61
Sometimes I'll just be walking
places on Robertson's.


1314
0:58:54,61 --> 0:58:56,295
It's like a street
for rich people.


1315
0:58:56,295 --> 0:58:58,815



1316
0:58:58,815 --> 0:59:1,14
And I'll just be like, who
the fuck is that dude?


1317
0:59:1,14 --> 0:59:2,39
He looks like a hot
Donny Wahlberg.


1318
0:59:2,39 --> 0:59:5,1



1319
0:59:5,1 --> 0:59:7,13
It is a hot Donny Wahlberg.


1320
0:59:7,13 --> 0:59:8,38
It's me.


1321
0:59:8,38 --> 0:59:11,49



1322
0:59:11,49 --> 0:59:12,74
Let's do another one of these.


1323
0:59:12,74 --> 0:59:19,96



1324
0:59:19,96 --> 0:59:21,22
I'm gonna teach you guys
something, OK?


1325
0:59:21,22 --> 0:59:23,77



1326
0:59:23,77 --> 0:59:27,8
If you didn't learn this from
the movie "Pain and Gain," I'm


1327
0:59:27,8 --> 0:59:30,36
just going to fucking spoon
feed it to you.


1328
0:59:30,36 --> 0:59:34,5
Don't trust people
in tank tops.


1329
0:59:34,5 --> 0:59:35,9
I'm talking about all
of them, too, OK?


1330
0:59:35,9 --> 0:59:38,51
Out here in L.A. we got
this neighborhood.


1331
0:59:38,51 --> 0:59:39,76
It's called Echo Park.


1332
0:59:39,76 --> 0:59:42,18



1333
0:59:42,18 --> 0:59:45,702
Don't trust those people
in tank tops.


1334
0:59:45,702 --> 0:59:49,242
They got credit cards with
their dad's name on them.


1335
0:59:49,242 --> 0:59:50,15
All right?


1336
0:59:50,15 --> 0:59:51,8
Here's another thing.


1337
0:59:51,8 --> 0:59:54,27
If you live outside of the
Midwest, and you're not doing


1338
0:59:54,27 --> 0:59:58,3
manual labor, and you have a
tank top on, your car better


1339
0:59:58,3 --> 0:59:59,98
be broke down somewhere and
you just had to walk here.


1340
0:59:59,98 --> 1:0:2,83



1341
1:0:2,83 --> 1:0:4,8
Here's another thing.


1342
1:0:4,8 --> 1:0:7,17



1343
1:0:7,17 --> 1:0:9,89
I'm saving you guys time right
now, you know why?


1344
1:0:9,89 --> 1:0:12,55
'Cause I'm Mark Wahlberg.


1345
1:0:12,55 --> 1:0:14,35
I do good things.


1346
1:0:14,35 --> 1:0:16,49
Did you see "The Fighter"?


1347
1:0:16,49 --> 1:0:18,14
Maybe somebody else should have
gotten an Academy Award


1348
1:0:18,14 --> 1:0:21,73
for that fucking movie, that's
all I'm saying, OK?


1349
1:0:21,73 --> 1:0:23,72
I really fucking boxed
in that movie.


1350
1:0:23,72 --> 1:0:25,33
They were like, Mark,
do you have a


1351
1:0:25,33 --> 1:0:26,38
problem fighting people?


1352
1:0:26,38 --> 1:0:28,79
I'm like, what?


1353
1:0:28,79 --> 1:0:32,87
No, I don't have a problem
fighting people.


1354
1:0:32,87 --> 1:0:33,88
I'm from Boston.


1355
1:0:33,88 --> 1:0:36,69
I fought my kindergarten
teacher.


1356
1:0:36,69 --> 1:0:37,89
When I was 22.


1357
1:0:37,89 --> 1:0:39,14
I went back.


1358
1:0:39,14 --> 1:0:42,58



1359
1:0:42,58 --> 1:0:45,1
Here's the last thing
I'll say about this.


1360
1:0:45,1 --> 1:0:48,12
If you've got a pattern on your
shirt, but a different


1361
1:0:48,12 --> 1:0:51,405
pattern on your collar, don't
talk to that person.


1362
1:0:51,405 --> 1:0:53,99



1363
1:0:53,99 --> 1:0:56,99
They don't deserve to
be here and they're


1364
1:0:56,99 --> 1:1:0,12
willing to wait in lines.


1365
1:1:0,12 --> 1:1:1,67
At clubs.


1366
1:1:1,67 --> 1:1:3,49
In Las Vegas.


1367
1:1:3,49 --> 1:1:5,24
And you know what I do?


1368
1:1:5,24 --> 1:1:8,14
I don't wait in fucking lines,
I'll tell you that much.


1369
1:1:8,14 --> 1:1:10,51
That's called a Donny thing.


1370
1:1:10,51 --> 1:1:11,76
Line waiting.


1371
1:1:11,76 --> 1:1:20,18



1372
1:1:20,18 --> 1:1:21,45
All right, here's the deal.


1373
1:1:21,45 --> 1:1:25,13



1374
1:1:25,13 --> 1:1:30,62
When you're a former rap star
and then A-plus list


1375
1:1:30,62 --> 1:1:35,23
celebrity, some rules
don't apply.


1376
1:1:35,23 --> 1:1:39,75
For example, maybe I can't
read or write.


1377
1:1:39,75 --> 1:1:40,46
I can--


1378
1:1:40,46 --> 1:1:42,37
fucking assholes for laughing
at that shit-- but


1379
1:1:42,37 --> 1:1:43,695
maybe I can't, OK?


1380
1:1:43,695 --> 1:1:46,93



1381
1:1:46,93 --> 1:1:49,19
I got problems with
the alphabet.


1382
1:1:49,19 --> 1:1:51,33
First of all, I never liked
that fucking cereal.


1383
1:1:51,33 --> 1:1:55,79



1384
1:1:55,79 --> 1:1:57,59
It was like Apple Jacks
for smart kids.


1385
1:1:57,59 --> 1:1:58,84
I don't fucking want
this shit.


1386
1:1:58,84 --> 1:2:2,68



1387
1:2:2,68 --> 1:2:5,16
One time I spent two and a half
hours just trying to get


1388
1:2:5,16 --> 1:2:6,85
my own fucking name
in the bowl.


1389
1:2:6,85 --> 1:2:10,66



1390
1:2:10,66 --> 1:2:11,98
But I got it!


1391
1:2:11,98 --> 1:2:14,775
M-A-R-R-K. Fucking
nailed that shit.


1392
1:2:14,775 --> 1:2:18,0



1393
1:2:18,0 --> 1:2:19,63
But people invent things to
fucking make you wrong.


1394
1:2:19,63 --> 1:2:21,6
Like, for example--


1395
1:2:21,6 --> 1:2:25,86
I don't know if this applies
to you guys--


1396
1:2:25,86 --> 1:2:28,68
but you can drive as
fast as you want.


1397
1:2:28,68 --> 1:2:30,58
Sure, they have fucking rules
for that shit, but


1398
1:2:30,58 --> 1:2:35,24
one, pay for it.


1399
1:2:35,24 --> 1:2:36,75
You guys are in movies
like me, right?


1400
1:2:36,75 --> 1:2:38,2
We're all friends, this
is a safe place?


1401
1:2:38,2 --> 1:2:40,93



1402
1:2:40,93 --> 1:2:43,19
The other thing is you just tell
them when they pull over.


1403
1:2:43,19 --> 1:2:46,15
Be like, that's a rule
you set for yourself.


1404
1:2:46,15 --> 1:2:48,282
That applies to other people.


1405
1:2:48,282 --> 1:2:50,105
I'm Mark Wahlberg.


1406
1:2:50,105 --> 1:2:52,15
That doesn't apply to me.


1407
1:2:52,15 --> 1:2:52,94
You can try saying that.


1408
1:2:52,94 --> 1:2:56,22
I don't know how fucking
far it'll get you.


1409
1:2:56,22 --> 1:2:58,61
But if you whisper it, you can
get pretty fucking far.


1410
1:2:58,61 --> 1:3:2,41



1411
1:3:2,41 --> 1:3:3,71
I'll beat one more of these.


1412
1:3:3,71 --> 1:3:5,49
By the way, for the record--


1413
1:3:5,49 --> 1:3:8,94
don't tell this to everybody
else you saw tonight--


1414
1:3:8,94 --> 1:3:10,19
I'm winning.


1415
1:3:10,19 --> 1:3:16,99



1416
1:3:16,99 --> 1:3:18,24
I used to not be rich.


1417
1:3:18,24 --> 1:3:21,4



1418
1:3:21,4 --> 1:3:24,48
But I still wanted to
be with a girl, OK?


1419
1:3:24,48 --> 1:3:28,15
So sometimes you get
what you pay for.


1420
1:3:28,15 --> 1:3:31,69



1421
1:3:31,69 --> 1:3:34,33
But it's about the
exchange, OK?


1422
1:3:34,33 --> 1:3:37,87
So you might say to a girl, what
are you willing to do for


1423
1:3:37,87 --> 1:3:41,3
this amount of money?


1424
1:3:41,3 --> 1:3:42,37
She only fucking
blinked at me.


1425
1:3:42,37 --> 1:3:45,68



1426
1:3:45,68 --> 1:3:48,51
But here's the deal--


1427
1:3:48,51 --> 1:3:51,87
here's the deal, OK--


1428
1:3:51,87 --> 1:3:55,0
I put on the song
"Drive." Right?


1429
1:3:55,0 --> 1:3:56,25
She blinked to the beats.


1430
1:3:56,25 --> 1:3:58,64



1431
1:3:58,64 --> 1:4:0,7
That was extra.


1432
1:4:0,7 --> 1:4:2,17
You guys might not get that
shit, because you know why?


1433
1:4:2,17 --> 1:4:3,5
Newsflash.


1434
1:4:3,5 --> 1:4:4,75
You're not even Donny
Wahlberg.


1435
1:4:4,75 --> 1:4:7,39



1436
1:4:7,39 --> 1:4:9,57
You're like Linda Wahlberg, who
nobody even fucking talks


1437
1:4:9,57 --> 1:4:12,71
to and I only see at
family reunions.


1438
1:4:12,71 --> 1:4:15,23
Which you're all more than
welcome to, but nobody gets to


1439
1:4:15,23 --> 1:4:16,78
be my partner for the
egg toss, OK?


1440
1:4:16,78 --> 1:4:19,53



1441
1:4:19,53 --> 1:4:24,6
That's reserved because
I like to fucking win.


1442
1:4:24,6 --> 1:4:25,31
Let's do one more of these.


1443
1:4:25,31 --> 1:4:34,37



1444
1:4:34,37 --> 1:4:37,69
You guys, I've got to
tell you a secret.


1445
1:4:37,69 --> 1:4:40,83
I got a movie coming out, OK?


1446
1:4:40,83 --> 1:4:44,97
Yes, for the 32nd time,
I play a cop.


1447
1:4:44,97 --> 1:4:48,926



1448
1:4:48,926 --> 1:4:49,86
People got mad at me.


1449
1:4:49,86 --> 1:4:50,82
Did you guys see "The
Happening"?


1450
1:4:50,82 --> 1:4:52,6
Everybody got so mad
at that movie.


1451
1:4:52,6 --> 1:4:52,99
So what?


1452
1:4:52,99 --> 1:4:54,72
I wanted to be a teacher
for one god damn


1453
1:4:54,72 --> 1:4:55,73
fucking time in a movie.


1454
1:4:55,73 --> 1:4:59,43
I wanted to be something
other than a cop, OK.


1455
1:4:59,43 --> 1:5:3,6
But then when I sat down to
write a movie, I still ended


1456
1:5:3,6 --> 1:5:6,91
up writing myself as
a fucking cop.


1457
1:5:6,91 --> 1:5:9,1
Here's the deal, though.


1458
1:5:9,1 --> 1:5:11,4
I wrote it myself.


1459
1:5:11,4 --> 1:5:13,11
By hand.


1460
1:5:13,11 --> 1:5:14,48
You guys ever try to spell
check something


1461
1:5:14,48 --> 1:5:17,46
you wrote by hand?


1462
1:5:17,46 --> 1:5:18,765
There's no fucking red lines.


1463
1:5:18,765 --> 1:5:22,99



1464
1:5:22,99 --> 1:5:25,19
Problem being Mark fucking
Wahlberg is, by the time I got


1465
1:5:25,19 --> 1:5:28,881
done, I went to go hand it to
people, I had already sold it.


1466
1:5:28,881 --> 1:5:31,65



1467
1:5:31,65 --> 1:5:34,11
Now we established earlier
this is a safe place, OK?


1468
1:5:34,11 --> 1:5:36,8
So I'm going to tell
you guys this.


1469
1:5:36,8 --> 1:5:39,64
I don't know have the heart to
tell these people it's not


1470
1:5:39,64 --> 1:5:47,18
called "Investibation." It's
called "Investigation." But I


1471
1:5:47,18 --> 1:5:48,43
already fucking sold
that movie.


1472
1:5:48,43 --> 1:5:52,0



1473
1:5:52,0 --> 1:5:54,73
So now I had to write in, I'm
like, I'm a cop who can stop


1474
1:5:54,73 --> 1:5:55,47
touching himself.


1475
1:5:55,47 --> 1:5:56,72
And they were like--


1476
1:5:56,72 --> 1:6:0,28



1477
1:6:0,28 --> 1:6:5,9
which, to be honest, I fucking
do that shit anyway.

The character's trying to raise
money through a fund


1590
1:10:1,467 --> 1:10:5,204

1592
1:10:11,11 --> 1:10:13,16
-And, start campaign.


1593
1:10:13,16 --> 1:10:14,5
And now we wait.


1594
1:10:14,5 --> 1:10:15,59
-I said if they donated fifty
dollars you'd kill a zombie


1595
1:10:15,59 --> 1:10:16,75
with your fork.


1596
1:10:16,75 --> 1:10:18,65
-You can't tell them I'm
going to do stuff.


1597
1:10:18,65 --> 1:10:20,434
-Think fast.


1598
1:10:20,434 --> 1:10:21,84
TODD WOMACK: That was amazing.


1599
1:10:21,84 --> 1:10:24,82
Now we shed a tear of
fond farewell as we


1600
1:10:24,82 --> 1:10:25,625

1:10:33,39 --> 1:10:34,32
MARK DOUGLAS: Yes.


1608
1:10:34,32 --> 1:10:36,913

1609
1:10:36,913 --> 1:10:37,72
TODD WOMACK: What?


1610
1:10:37,72 --> 1:10:39,79

MARK DOUGLAS: The editor of
"Shapely Male" magazine.


1614
1:10:45,95 --> 1:10:47,13
TODD WOMACK: Is that
guy-- is it you?


1615
1:10:47,13 --> 1:10:49,87
MARK DOUGLAS: Maybe.


1616
1:10:49,87 --> 1:10:51,12

1625
1:11:13,77 --> 1:11:14,76
Holy crap.


1626
1:11:14,76 --> 1:11:19,92
Our first performers you may
have seen on Conan or at Largo


1627
1:11:19,92 --> 1:11:21,23
here in Los Angeles.


1628
1:11:21,23 --> 1:11:24,35
We are lucky to have them as
they are on their way to the


1629
1:11:24,35 --> 1:11:26,24
airport to play to Sasquatch!


1630
1:11:26,24 --> 1:11:28,37

C-Zoners out there, you guys?

1:18:28,9 --> 1:18:31,853
Your girl Swynn here, joined
by a very special guest.


1637
1:18:31,853 --> 1:18:34,49
We've got Bob the Baker
in the house.


1638
1:18:34,49 --> 1:18:36,55
BOB THE BAKER: Mike, call me
back if you get a chance.


1639
1:18:36,55 --> 1:18:53,29



1640
1:18:53,29 --> 1:18:54,25
SWYNN: What is it about
the album that


1641
1:18:54,25 --> 1:18:56,48
you're most proud of?


1642
1:18:56,48 --> 1:18:59,59
BOB THE BAKER: I'm real proud of
the album artwork, done by


1643
1:18:59,59 --> 1:19:2,23
my homie Mike who I haven't
talked in a couple days.


1644
1:19:2,23 --> 1:19:3,98
Mike, call me back.


1645
1:19:3,98 --> 1:19:6,54
SWYNN: If you were going to be
any reality show, what reality


1646
1:19:6,54 --> 1:19:8,7
show would you choose?


1647
1:19:8,7 --> 1:19:10,74
BOB THE BAKER: The
Surreal Life.


1648
1:19:10,74 --> 1:19:11,98
It doesn't come on no more.


1649
1:19:11,98 --> 1:19:14,83
SWYNN: I was gonna say--


1650
1:19:14,83 --> 1:19:15,72
BOB THE BAKER: It was
cool, though.


1651
1:19:15,72 --> 1:19:16,92
It was like washed
up celebrities.


1652
1:19:16,92 --> 1:19:19,0
Vanilla Ice was on there--


1653
1:19:19,0 --> 1:19:20,46
heavily influenced by him.


1654
1:19:20,46 --> 1:19:22,83
I'd like to do things that
he does in life.


1655
1:19:22,83 --> 1:19:24,8
Mike, call me back.


1656
1:19:24,8 --> 1:19:28,44



1657
1:19:28,44 --> 1:19:30,7
SWYNN: If you could collaborate
with anyone, who


1658
1:19:30,7 --> 1:19:33,6
would you want to collaborate
with these days?


1659
1:19:33,6 --> 1:19:35,14
BOB THE BAKER: I don't like
anybody is on my dopeness


1660
1:19:35,14 --> 1:19:38,2
level but if I could collaborate
with anybody, Mike


1661
1:19:38,2 --> 1:19:38,72
knows this question.


1662
1:19:38,72 --> 1:19:40,4
Mike call me back if you--


1663
1:19:40,4 --> 1:19:41,65
if you can tell her
this answer.


1664
1:19:41,65 --> 1:19:46,29



1665
1:19:46,29 --> 1:19:47,98
SWYNN: Another exciting thing
you have going on right now,


1666
1:19:47,98 --> 1:19:50,89
the Pop Pop Fest 2013--


1667
1:19:50,89 --> 1:19:51,38
BOB THE BAKER: --yeah--


1668
1:19:51,38 --> 1:19:52,75
SWYNN: --coming up here
you're headlining--


1669
1:19:52,75 --> 1:19:54,23
BOB THE BAKER: I'm really
excited for that shit as you


1670
1:19:54,23 --> 1:19:54,98
could tell.


1671
1:19:54,98 --> 1:19:56,98
Mike, take me back.


1672
1:19:56,98 --> 1:20:0,39



1673
1:20:0,39 --> 1:20:2,79
This is where most of my
dope-ass beats come from.


1674
1:20:2,79 --> 1:20:5,37
I usually lay them
down myself.


1675
1:20:5,37 --> 1:20:7,88
And this is called the pan
because it looks like


1676
1:20:7,88 --> 1:20:10,7
something that I would fry
some orange chicken in.


1677
1:20:10,7 --> 1:20:13,885
I call this thunder.


1678
1:20:13,885 --> 1:20:17,43
And this is-- and this
is little thunder.


1679
1:20:17,43 --> 1:20:20,24
And this is the one that hurts
my ears, but I love it the


1680
1:20:20,24 --> 1:20:22,61
most because it builds character
in my brain.


1681
1:20:22,61 --> 1:20:24,33
SWYNN: Tonight you're going to
play one of the songs off your


1682
1:20:24,33 --> 1:20:27,22
album, so let's go
forward, right?


1683
1:20:27,22 --> 1:20:27,63
BOB THE BAKER: Yeah.


1684
1:20:27,63 --> 1:20:30,84
Um, this is a track called,
"Dude, I Miss You." It is not


1685
1:20:30,84 --> 1:20:33,1
written about anybody in
particular, but if you it was


1686
1:20:33,1 --> 1:20:34,3
it would probably be
about Mike, who


1687
1:20:34,3 --> 1:20:35,37
hasn't called me back.


1688
1:20:35,37 --> 1:20:37,422
He should do that.

1690
1:21:8,386 --> 1:21:14,91
SWYNN: Um, so are you
OK there, Bob?


1691
1:21:14,91 --> 1:21:17,94
Do you want to talk about it?

BETH HOYT: What's
up, music night?


1693
1:21:19,3 --> 1:21:21,51
All right, coming up soon we
have a set from YouTube

1695
1:21:23,6 --> 1:21:26,73
Our next performer is a rapper
who doesn't represent a


1696
1:21:26,73 --> 1:21:28,98
neighborhood or a city--


1697
1:21:28,98 --> 1:21:31,51
don't do that, Beth-- he
represents a season.


1698
1:21:31,51 --> 1:21:34,37
As King of Summer he has
released three albums,


1699
1:21:34,37 --> 1:21:37,55
performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live,
and hosts his on podcast


1700

"Who Charted?" When he's not


1701
1:21:40,585 --> 1:21:44,11
out dispensing summer gum he's
in the studio fighting off the


1702
1:21:44,11 --> 1:21:45,26

1714
1:22:5,47 --> 1:22:7,15
Who's really depressed
right now?


1715
1:22:7,15 --> 1:22:8,18
I'll aim my show at you.


1716
1:22:8,18 --> 1:22:10,972
Where are the depressed
people?


1717
1:22:10,972 --> 1:22:12,92
When I say--


1718
1:22:12,92 --> 1:22:17,7
when I say it's all too much,
y'all say, I know!


1719
1:22:17,7 --> 1:22:19,74
It's all too much!


1720
1:22:19,74 --> 1:22:25,12
When I say what, y'all
say, --'s the point.


1721
1:22:25,12 --> 1:22:27,32
What--


1722
1:22:27,32 --> 1:22:28,94
Exactly.


1723
1:22:28,94 --> 1:22:30,12
You guys got it.


1724
1:22:30,12 --> 1:22:31,79
All right, I came here
to do some music.

You guys want to hear
some music?


1726
1:22:34,45 --> 1:22:36,66
All right, here we go.


1727
1:22:36,66 --> 1:22:39,4
This first song is about the
time that I drank two bottles


1728
1:22:39,4 --> 1:22:42,29
of sake, ate three Vicodin,
and attempted


1729
1:22:42,29 --> 1:22:45,56
to do a comedy show.

1:22:52,15 --> 1:22:53,62
Give it up for my DJ.


1733
1:22:53,62 --> 1:22:55,932
Sounds good back there.


1734
1:22:55,932 --> 1:22:56,58
All right.


1735
1:22:56,58 --> 1:22:58,46
I'll tell you a little
bit about myself.


1736
1:22:58,46 --> 1:23:2,29
I'm wearing a dumb blue hat.


1737
1:23:2,29 --> 1:23:3,74
Thanks for catching that.


1738
1:23:3,74 --> 1:23:9,9
I could be any villain from the
movie "Taken." If it was,


1739
1:23:9,9 --> 1:23:12,4
like, cold in Bulgaria, or
wherever the hell they


1740
1:23:12,4 --> 1:23:13,88
happened to be.


1741
1:23:13,88 --> 1:23:16,21
Isn't that right, sir?


1742
1:23:16,21 --> 1:23:18,86
You're on the internet.


1743
1:23:18,86 --> 1:23:22,23
It's exc-- who's never been
on the net before?


1744
1:23:22,23 --> 1:23:23,11
A couple people.


1745
1:23:23,11 --> 1:23:24,7
It's exciting.


1746
1:23:24,7 --> 1:23:24,73
This is gonna be it.


1747
1:23:24,73 --> 1:23:26,25
This is gonna be
the only time.


1748
1:23:26,25 --> 1:23:27,17
I'll probably be on.


1749
1:23:27,17 --> 1:23:29,1
I'm not that excited.


1750
1:23:29,1 --> 1:23:32,16
Guys, if you like what you're
enjoying so far next Thursday


1751
1:23:32,16 --> 1:23:35,7
night I'll be doing a show at
the Ross Dress for Less on


1752
1:23:35,7 --> 1:23:36,92

1753
1:23:36,92 --> 1:23:39,34
Thank you.


1754
1:23:39,34 --> 1:23:39,97
You got it.


1755
1:23:39,97 --> 1:23:42,29
I'm also a consultant there.


1756
1:23:42,29 --> 1:23:44,57
I consult them on how to keep
the place looking like a


1757
1:23:44,57 --> 1:23:47,5
disaster area at all times.


1758
1:23:47,5 --> 1:23:48,89
I'm very hands on about it.


1759
1:23:48,89 --> 1:23:51,86
I'll actually move a children's
story into the size


1760
1:23:51,86 --> 1:23:55,79
58 jeans section.


1761
1:23:55,79 --> 1:23:58,8
The ones with the Fat Albert
painted on the side.


1762
1:23:58,8 --> 1:24:0,7
Yeah, that's it.


1763
1:24:0,7 --> 1:24:0,49
All right.


1764
1:24:0,49 --> 1:24:3,64
Next Friday I'll be doing a show
at the kids Foot Locker


1765
1:24:3,64 --> 1:24:6,23
at the Glendale Galleria.


1766
1:24:6,23 --> 1:24:9,92
I noticed some of you not that
into my stuff, but Armenian


1767
1:24:9,92 --> 1:24:14,0
children being fitted for
size three Nikes--


1768
1:24:14,0 --> 1:24:17,39
that's my demographic.


1769
1:24:17,39 --> 1:24:18,92
All right, let's do
another song.


1770
1:24:18,92 --> 1:24:21,11
Here we go.


1771
1:24:21,11 --> 1:24:24,69
This one's called "Applebee's,
We Found a Way to Fuck Up


1772
1:24:24,69 --> 1:24:25,98
Salad." Here we go.


1773
1:24:25,98 --> 1:24:28,62



1774
1:24:28,62 --> 1:24:29,23
Sounds good.


1775
1:24:29,23 --> 1:24:31,801
Give up for my DJ,
Scratchitory--


1776
1:24:31,801 --> 1:24:32,743
Scratchitory Rape.


1777
1:24:32,743 --> 1:24:34,156
He's right back there on
the ones and twos.


1778
1:24:34,156 --> 1:24:38,4



1779
1:24:38,4 --> 1:24:39,33
The music sounded good.


1780
1:24:39,33 --> 1:24:40,79
Well, why don't we just
do another one?


1781
1:24:40,79 --> 1:24:42,54
Here we go.


1782
1:24:42,54 --> 1:24:46,65
This song is about the curative
powers of my wang.


1783
1:24:46,65 --> 1:24:49,926
It's called, "I Heal With
My Steel." Here we go.


1784
1:24:49,926 --> 1:24:50,842
Let's do it.


1785
1:24:50,842 --> 1:24:52,67
Oh my god, real song.


1786
1:24:52,67 --> 1:24:53,832
Hands!


1787
1:24:53,832 --> 1:24:54,736
Side to side!


1788
1:24:54,736 --> 1:24:55,64
What's going to happen?


1789
1:24:55,64 --> 1:24:56,55
Oh, no.


1790
1:24:56,55 --> 1:24:57,815
There you go, yeah.


1791
1:24:57,815 --> 1:24:59,48
Side to side, people.


1792
1:24:59,48 --> 1:25:4,21
Like you're at a Jay-Z
internet only show.


1793
1:25:4,21 --> 1:25:5,81
Keep 'em moving, keep
'em moving.


1794
1:25:5,81 --> 1:25:8,19
Here we go.


1795
1:25:8,19 --> 1:26:9,286
[MUSIC]


1796
1:26:9,286 --> 1:26:10,98
Cut that off, Scratchitory.


1797
1:26:10,98 --> 1:26:11,35
Beautiful.


1798
1:26:11,35 --> 1:26:13,46
Give it up for the ladies.


1799
1:26:13,46 --> 1:26:16,1
Oh, yeah.


1800
1:26:16,1 --> 1:26:19,2
Wow, that was something.


1801
1:26:19,2 --> 1:26:20,44
I don't know if you
guys enjoyed the


1802
1:26:20,44 --> 1:26:22,65
lyrics to that song.


1803
1:26:22,65 --> 1:26:26,94
My target demographic is boys
between the age of 15 and 15


1804
1:26:26,94 --> 1:26:28,19
and a half.


1805
1:26:28,19 --> 1:26:30,39



1806
1:26:30,39 --> 1:26:31,86
I think we nailed
it right there.


1807
1:26:31,86 --> 1:26:32,655
I think we did.


1808
1:26:32,655 --> 1:26:33,57
I think we did.


1809
1:26:33,57 --> 1:26:36,0
Hey, you know, I'm trying to get
out of the comedy business


1810
1:26:36,0 --> 1:26:39,92
and I've been trying
for a while now.


1811
1:26:39,92 --> 1:26:40,93
It's tough.


1812
1:26:40,93 --> 1:26:44,48
I came up with a business
idea, Shreds-taurant.


1813
1:26:44,48 --> 1:26:48,27
Shreds-taurant, a guitar
themed eatery.


1814
1:26:48,27 --> 1:26:51,18
All the waiters can shred
on the guitar.


1815
1:26:51,18 --> 1:26:53,11
We give them a custom made
guitar, they take


1816
1:26:53,11 --> 1:26:55,59
your order on guitar.


1817
1:26:55,59 --> 1:26:59,18
I'm still speaking
English, right?


1818
1:26:59,18 --> 1:27:1,58
Just checking.


1819
1:27:1,58 --> 1:27:2,35
Just checking.


1820
1:27:2,35 --> 1:27:3,98
Let's make believe we're
at Shreds-taurant.


1821
1:27:3,98 --> 1:27:4,57
Hi, ma'am.


1822
1:27:4,57 --> 1:27:5,64
Welcome to Shreds-taurant.


1823
1:27:5,64 --> 1:27:8,451
What can I get you to drink?


1824
1:27:8,451 --> 1:27:11,11
A beer, no problem.


1825
1:27:11,11 --> 1:27:14,49
[HUMS]


1826
1:27:14,49 --> 1:27:15,74
--a beer.


1827
1:27:15,74 --> 1:27:18,31



1828
1:27:18,31 --> 1:27:19,2
And they send that.


1829
1:27:19,2 --> 1:27:20,6
It's a beautiful thing.


1830
1:27:20,6 --> 1:27:21,79
You know you'd eat there.


1831
1:27:21,79 --> 1:27:25,34
Hello, sir, what can I get you
for dinner tonight, even


1832
1:27:25,34 --> 1:27:26,53
though I'm looking at a lady?


1833
1:27:26,53 --> 1:27:28,8
Hello, sir.


1834
1:27:28,8 --> 1:27:29,63
We're not really at
Shreds-taurant.


1835
1:27:29,63 --> 1:27:30,5
It's OK.


1836
1:27:30,5 --> 1:27:30,86
It doesn't matter.


1837
1:27:30,86 --> 1:27:33,88
What can I get you
to eat tonight?


1838
1:27:33,88 --> 1:27:34,89
A steak.


1839
1:27:34,89 --> 1:27:37,134
You got it.

1:27:37,134 --> 1:27:40,18

1841
1:27:40,18 --> 1:27:41,43
--a steak.


1842
1:27:41,43 --> 1:27:43,98



1843
1:27:43,98 --> 1:27:46,29
Pick it up on this
side, come on.


1844
1:27:46,29 --> 1:27:50,59
Laugh or the bit
will continue.


1845
1:27:50,59 --> 1:27:53,1
There, that-- now you
see how it works.


1846
1:27:53,1 --> 1:27:54,12
All right, let's do a song.


1847
1:27:54,12 --> 1:27:54,66
Here we go.


1848
1:27:54,66 --> 1:27:57,11
You know, before I got into the
rap game I didn't have a


1849
1:27:57,11 --> 1:27:58,16
lot of cash.


1850
1:27:58,16 --> 1:28:1,5
I had to do creative things to
keep the ladies interested.


1851
1:28:1,5 --> 1:28:5,23
This song is called, "Buy You
Clothes, Do You In Them, Take


1852
1:28:5,23 --> 1:28:11,1
Them Back." Thank you so much.


1853
1:28:11,1 --> 1:28:15,11
Give it up for Scratchitory
Rape on the ones and twos.


1854
1:28:15,11 --> 1:28:17,49
Fantastic.


1855
1:28:17,49 --> 1:28:19,15
Really fantastic.


1856
1:28:19,15 --> 1:28:21,48
Tell you a little
about myself, I


1857
1:28:21,48 --> 1:28:24,41
recently bought a goldfish.


1858
1:28:24,41 --> 1:28:27,17
Turns out it's epileptic.


1859
1:28:27,17 --> 1:28:28,76
Weird thing is, as long
as I leave it in


1860
1:28:28,76 --> 1:28:32,16
the bowl it's fine.


1861
1:28:32,16 --> 1:28:33,87
Second--


1862
1:28:33,87 --> 1:28:34,8
come on, corner--


1863
1:28:34,8 --> 1:28:38,38
second you take it out, just
seizure city, flipping out all


1864
1:28:38,38 --> 1:28:40,6
over the place.


1865
1:28:40,6 --> 1:28:41,94
Fantastic.


1866
1:28:41,94 --> 1:28:43,1
Let's add another song.


1867
1:28:43,1 --> 1:28:45,83
Let's do it.


1868
1:28:45,83 --> 1:28:49,7
This song is called, "A Strip
Club Shouldn't Smell Like


1869
1:28:49,7 --> 1:28:56,9
Pierogies." Spearmint Rhino
Oxnard, that's right, sir.


1870
1:28:56,9 --> 1:28:56,73
You got it.


1871
1:28:56,73 --> 1:28:57,39
That's the one.


1872
1:28:57,39 --> 1:28:59,15
That's the place.


1873
1:28:59,15 --> 1:29:0,68
That's the place.


1874
1:29:0,68 --> 1:29:5,79
Guys, it feels good to be
here, working the net.


1875
1:29:5,79 --> 1:29:8,91
Anybody else make money
on the net?


1876
1:29:8,91 --> 1:29:11,14
Any eBay people?


1877
1:29:11,14 --> 1:29:12,39
All right, let's do a song.


1878
1:29:12,39 --> 1:29:14,98



1879
1:29:14,98 --> 1:29:17,555
How many people here are
in a relationship?


1880
1:29:17,555 --> 1:29:18,39
All right.


1881
1:29:18,39 --> 1:29:20,71
Out of those people, who here's
in a relationship with


1882
1:29:20,71 --> 1:29:22,68
someone who likes
to talk back?


1883
1:29:22,68 --> 1:29:25,44



1884
1:29:25,44 --> 1:29:26,84
Who's in a relationship
with someone who


1885
1:29:26,84 --> 1:29:30,37
likes to give you lip?


1886
1:29:30,37 --> 1:29:31,27
This song's for you.


1887
1:29:31,27 --> 1:29:33,58
It's a tale of revenge.


1888
1:29:33,58 --> 1:29:37,1
This song is called, "You Won't
Sass Me Like That When I


1889
1:29:37,1 --> 1:29:42,47
Can Summon Wolves."
Here we go.


1890

1:30:29,233 --> 1:30:30,2

Let's hear some wolf
noises, everybody!


1894
1:30:32,565 --> 1:30:36,36



1895
1:30:36,36 --> 1:30:38,344
Give it up for the wolf.


1896
1:30:38,344 --> 1:30:39,93
All right, cut that,
Scratchitory.


1897
1:30:39,93 --> 1:30:44,29
Hey, let's hear some wolves'
noises in this corner.


1898
1:30:44,29 --> 1:30:45,15
There you go.


1899
1:30:45,15 --> 1:30:47,76
You're gonna be ready once we
crank this thing up and really


1900
1:30:47,76 --> 1:30:50,28
show it on the net.


1901
1:30:50,28 --> 1:30:51,32
How are you?


1902
1:30:51,32 --> 1:30:53,55
All right.


1903
1:30:53,55 --> 1:30:56,5
Tell you a little bit more about
myself, I could turn any


1904
1:30:56,5 --> 1:30:59,86
cat against its owner.


1905
1:30:59,86 --> 1:31:1,26
Something about the
way I pet them.


1906
1:31:1,26 --> 1:31:3,21
Do you have a cat, sir?


1907
1:31:3,21 --> 1:31:4,21
Same lady as before.


1908
1:31:4,21 --> 1:31:7,5
Sir, do you have a cat?


1909
1:31:7,5 --> 1:31:7,61
No cat.


1910
1:31:7,61 --> 1:31:9,52
All right, I won't come
over and prove it.


1911
1:31:9,52 --> 1:31:10,47
Until you get one.


1912
1:31:10,47 --> 1:31:11,82
Buy yourself a cat.


1913
1:31:11,82 --> 1:31:14,98



1914
1:31:14,98 --> 1:31:17,508
Hey, guys.


1915
1:31:17,508 --> 1:31:20,36
I'm giving the people at home
a chance to go to the men's


1916
1:31:20,36 --> 1:31:24,29
room, maybe get themselves
something to drink.


1917
1:31:24,29 --> 1:31:25,54
Let's do another song.


1918
1:31:25,54 --> 1:31:31,11



1919
1:31:31,11 --> 1:31:34,74
This song is called, "A Baby's
Hand Is Cuter Than An Adult


1920
1:31:34,74 --> 1:31:39,27
Hand." But if you're sitting
on the toilet and a hand


1921
1:31:39,27 --> 1:31:43,94
reaches up out of the bowl, the
baby's hand is creepier.


1922
1:31:43,94 --> 1:31:47,51



1923
1:31:47,51 --> 1:31:50,26
It's an unwieldy chorus, but
I think we made it work.


1924
1:31:50,26 --> 1:31:50,81
Yes, we did.


1925
1:31:50,81 --> 1:31:52,6
Give it up for Scratchitory.


1926
1:31:52,6 --> 1:31:57,69



1927
1:31:57,69 --> 1:31:59,74
One final song to do for you.


1928
1:31:59,74 --> 1:32:2,17
This one is on the new album
"Douche Manouche." Pick it up


1929
1:32:2,17 --> 1:32:4,89
on iTunes, pick it up on
YouTube, [? Jash, ?] wherever


1930
1:32:4,89 --> 1:32:5,84
they sell it.


1931
1:32:5,84 --> 1:32:8,37
Ladies and gentlemen, this
song is about when


1932
1:32:8,37 --> 1:32:9,76
you're kind of, uh--


1933
1:32:9,76 --> 1:32:14,4
been doing some work in the
bedroom, sir, right?


1934
1:32:14,4 --> 1:32:19,54
And you've been pound it in an
aggressive way, and then the


1935
1:32:19,54 --> 1:32:26,91
girl when she gets up to walk
away, she's wobbling like a


1936
1:32:26,91 --> 1:32:27,95
newborn baby colt.


1937
1:32:27,95 --> 1:32:28,38
Here we go.


1938
1:32:28,38 --> 1:32:29,17

"Newborn Baby Colt." [MUSIC]

Thank you so much.


1942
1:33:32,735 --> 1:33:34,72
Comedy Week was fantastic.


1943
1:33:34,72 --> 1:33:36,155
Give it up for the dancers.

1945
1:33:37,62 --> 1:33:38,92
Take care.

1949
1:33:48,54 --> 1:33:49,502
Hey.


1950
1:33:49,502 --> 1:33:50,94
That was easy for me.


1951
1:33:50,94 --> 1:33:52,6
I know how to yawn.


1952
1:33:52,6 --> 1:33:53,32
What about you?


1953
1:33:53,32 --> 1:33:55,29
How many times have you
been in a situation


1954
1:33:55,29 --> 1:33:56,36
where you need to yawn?


1955
1:33:56,36 --> 1:33:58,53
Whether you're at school,
playing some milk caps at


1956
1:33:58,53 --> 1:34:1,34
recess, or down by the local
pond with your friends,


1957
1:34:1,34 --> 1:34:3,587
yawning is essential
to acting.

1959
1:34:15,108 --> 1:34:19,13
TERRY SILK: The yawn is a
perfect way to sabotage other


1960
1:34:19,13 --> 1:34:20,21
people's game--


1961
1:34:20,21 --> 1:34:23,285
for example, that guy trying
to get into the panties of


1962
1:34:23,285 --> 1:34:24,23
that girl you like.


1963
1:34:24,23 --> 1:34:27,231
You could roll up to him, yawn
while he's trying to fuck her,


1964
1:34:27,231 --> 1:34:30,177
and ruin the whole thing.


1965
1:34:30,177 --> 1:34:31,78
Off the top of my head,
probably the


1966
1:34:31,78 --> 1:34:34,2
best yawning scene?


1967
1:34:34,2 --> 1:34:35,69
"The City Just Ain't
White," maybe.


1968
1:34:35,69 --> 1:34:37,58
It's a pretty solid one.


1969
1:34:37,58 --> 1:34:46,39
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]


1970
1:34:46,39 --> 1:34:49,2
TERRY SILK: Well, you've seen
some pretty serious yawns from


1971
1:34:49,2 --> 1:34:52,9
some pretty seriously talented
people, but what about if


1972
1:34:52,9 --> 1:34:56,53
you're not just yawning in a
play, but you're on an actual


1973
1:34:56,53 --> 1:34:58,3
motion picture set?


1974
1:34:58,3 --> 1:35:0,78
Knowing when to yawn and
how to yawn isn't


1975
1:35:0,78 --> 1:35:2,46
as easy as it looks.


1976
1:35:2,46 --> 1:35:6,5
Sometimes you have to wait hours
in between takes, so


1977
1:35:6,5 --> 1:35:9,84
freezing the yawn on your face
isn't always an option.


1978
1:35:9,84 --> 1:35:11,9
That's why I sell these.


1979
1:35:11,9 --> 1:35:12,345
It's a yawn sack.


1980
1:35:12,345 --> 1:35:15,67
Keeps your yawn good up to 24
hours and they're available on


1981
1:35:15,67 --> 1:35:17,14
my website.


1982
1:35:17,14 --> 1:35:21,44
Just freeze the yawn and use
it when you need it.


1983
1:35:21,44 --> 1:35:23,345
Well, thanks for
watching, guys.


1984
1:35:23,345 --> 1:35:24,62
It's been a blast.


1985
1:35:24,62 --> 1:35:25,86
I'll be back soon.


1986
1:35:25,86 --> 1:35:28,51
And like that old dude said,
all the world's a stage.


1987
1:35:28,51 --> 1:35:30,45
So why stop acting?


1988
1:35:30,45 --> 1:35:32,85
It will only show people who
you really are, and that'll


1989
1:35:32,85 --> 1:35:34,1
give them the upper hand.


1990
1:35:34,1 --> 1:35:40,8



1991
1:35:40,8 --> 1:35:42,9
BETH HOYT: Welcome back
to our big finale.


1992
1:35:42,9 --> 1:35:46,79
Coming up, get ready for the
godfather of musical comedy,


1993
1:35:46,79 --> 1:35:48,34
Weird Al Yankovic.


1994
1:35:48,34 --> 1:35:52,26
But first, our next performer
is a very funny lady.


1995
1:35:52,26 --> 1:35:54,54
You may know her from the
classic sketch comedy show


1996
1:35:54,54 --> 1:35:57,802
"Mr. Show," or from a time as
head writer for "The Ellen


1997
1:35:57,802 --> 1:36:1,32
Show," or maybe even from her
time as creator of The Girls


1998
1:36:1,32 --> 1:36:2,2
Guitar Club.


1999
1:36:2,2 --> 1:36:4,5
Please give it up for
Karen Kilgariff!


2000
1:36:4,5 --> 1:36:9,5



2001
1:36:9,5 --> 1:36:11,464
KAREN KILGARIFF: Thank you.

2003
1:38:20,36 --> 1:38:22,78
Thank you so much.


2004
1:38:22,78 --> 1:38:23,73
Thank you very much.


2005
1:38:23,73 --> 1:38:25,35
It's an honor to be here.


2006
1:38:25,35 --> 1:38:28,98
This is one of my favorite
clubs to play.


2007
1:38:28,98 --> 1:38:31,43
I like to come here on Saturdays
and listen to smooth


2008
1:38:31,43 --> 1:38:32,7
jazz so it's amazing.


2009
1:38:32,7 --> 1:38:35,525



2010
1:38:35,525 --> 1:38:36,78
I'm going to sing a
little song about


2011
1:38:36,78 --> 1:38:39,275
all of us right now.


2012
1:38:39,275 --> 1:40:30,458

2013
1:40:30,458 --> 1:40:32,31
Thank you.


2014
1:40:32,31 --> 1:40:34,24
Thanks, I know that
one's heavy.


2015
1:40:34,24 --> 1:40:38,7
It's a lot to take for one
audience and you probably want


2016
1:40:38,7 --> 1:40:40,62
me to joke you out of it right
now, but I'm not going to


2017
1:40:40,62 --> 1:40:41,87
because you're adults, OK?


2018
1:40:41,87 --> 1:40:48,6



2019
1:40:48,6 --> 1:40:49,22
It's really nice to be here.


2020
1:40:49,22 --> 1:40:49,82
I--


2021
1:40:49,82 --> 1:40:51,81
just tell you a little bit of
something about myself--


2022
1:40:51,81 --> 1:40:59,84
I have a really mean dad and
so I'm really funny.


2023
1:40:59,84 --> 1:41:0,86
And this is just an example--


2024
1:41:0,86 --> 1:41:3,32
I'm sure he'll see this and he'd
like to argue, but this


2025
1:41:3,32 --> 1:41:4,94
is my example.


2026
1:41:4,94 --> 1:41:7,61
My dad came down to visit me
once and we went to get in the


2027
1:41:7,61 --> 1:41:8,35
car together.


2028
1:41:8,35 --> 1:41:11,16
We walked out into the driveway
and I could smell the


2029
1:41:11,16 --> 1:41:13,13
lemon tree that was
in my backyard.


2030
1:41:13,13 --> 1:41:16,32
And so I was like, ooo,
it smells like lemons.


2031
1:41:16,32 --> 1:41:18,75
And immediately, without pause,
my dad goes, what are


2032
1:41:18,75 --> 1:41:21,42
you, half Iroquois?


2033
1:41:21,42 --> 1:41:22,87
Yeah.


2034
1:41:22,87 --> 1:41:25,4
Drink that in.


2035
1:41:25,4 --> 1:41:27,31
You do know Iroquois
are Indians, right?


2036
1:41:27,31 --> 1:41:28,35
Native Americans?


2037
1:41:28,35 --> 1:41:30,94
They're very attuned to nature
and they can smell things from


2038
1:41:30,94 --> 1:41:33,238
a distance.

1:41:33,238 --> 1:44:45,85

2040
1:44:45,85 --> 1:44:47,1
Thank you.

1:44:47,1 --> 1:44:50,97



2042
1:44:50,97 --> 1:44:53,17
BETH HOYT: Ladies and gentleman,
tonight isn't just


2043
1:44:53,17 --> 1:44:57,2
about the wild and the giddy
fun of musical comedy, it's


2044
1:44:57,2 --> 1:45:0,9
also about the hard road
back to the spotlight.


2045
1:45:0,9 --> 1:45:4,0
Our next guest recently had a
fall from grace and has only


2046
1:45:4,0 --> 1:45:6,97
recently began to put his
life back together.


2047
1:45:6,97 --> 1:45:10,21
Nick Thune has fallen, and it
may surprise you how he gets


2048
1:45:10,21 --> 1:45:11,62
back on his feet.


2049
1:45:11,62 --> 1:45:12,811
Please take a look.


2050
1:45:12,811 --> 1:45:27,86
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]


2051
1:45:27,86 --> 1:45:33,4
-So tonight's my first night
back on stage since the break.


2052
1:45:33,4 --> 1:45:34,27
I've been scared.


2053
1:45:34,27 --> 1:45:37,37
I thought maybe I wasn't going
to make it back on stage.


2054
1:45:37,37 --> 1:45:39,82
Doctor said I'm never to
play guitar again.


2055
1:45:39,82 --> 1:45:43,2
For about six weeks.


2056
1:45:43,2 --> 1:45:45,76
Bo Jackson broke his hip.


2057
1:45:45,76 --> 1:45:46,84
He did not give up.


2058
1:45:46,84 --> 1:45:50,94
First game back, first
pitch, first swing,


2059
1:45:50,94 --> 1:45:52,19
he hit a home run.


2060
1:45:52,19 --> 1:45:56,82



2061
1:45:56,82 --> 1:46:0,59
Will I get a standing ovation
on my first joke tonight?


2062
1:46:0,59 --> 1:46:1,41
I don't know.


2063
1:46:1,41 --> 1:46:2,597
That's my goal, though.


2064
1:46:2,597 --> 1:46:6,89
-Please put your hands together
for Mr. Nick Thune!


2065
1:46:6,89 --> 1:46:7,57
-I can't do it.


2066
1:46:7,57 --> 1:46:8,915
I'm not going to do the show.


2067
1:46:8,915 --> 1:46:9,92
What am I even thinking?


2068
1:46:9,92 --> 1:46:12,14
It's an unattainable dream.


2069
1:46:12,14 --> 1:46:12,7
Should I jump?


2070
1:46:12,7 --> 1:46:13,76
Should I just break
my other arm?


2071
1:46:13,76 --> 1:46:15,64
It's like I'm re-learning
everything.


2072
1:46:15,64 --> 1:46:18,22
I'm re-learning how
to love again.


2073
1:46:18,22 --> 1:46:20,95
My wife, she says, you're
not the man I married.


2074
1:46:20,95 --> 1:46:22,56
The man I married
had two arms.


2075
1:46:22,56 --> 1:46:25,262
I actually feel sick
right now.


2076
1:46:25,262 --> 1:46:29,1
I don't even know who
I am anymore.


2077
1:46:29,1 --> 1:46:31,4
A standing ovation
off of one joke.


2078
1:46:31,4 --> 1:46:33,76
Now I know why people compare
me to Bo Jackson, you know,


2079
1:46:33,76 --> 1:46:35,58
because that's what I'm
going to do tonight.


2080
1:46:35,58 --> 1:46:36,96
Doctor said he would
never play a


2081
1:46:36,96 --> 1:46:38,17
professional sport again.


2082
1:46:38,17 --> 1:46:39,17
Bo can't hear that.


2083
1:46:39,17 --> 1:46:40,93
He started working out.


2084
1:46:40,93 --> 1:46:43,12
I got a letter last week from
an 11-year-old boy in Fort


2085
1:46:43,12 --> 1:46:45,21
Lauderdale who broke
his wrist.


2086
1:46:45,21 --> 1:46:46,595
He was trying to light
a fart in his bunk


2087
1:46:46,595 --> 1:46:47,8
bed and he fell off.


2088
1:46:47,8 --> 1:46:51,39
He said knowing that I'm going
to go out on stage tonight,


2089
1:46:51,39 --> 1:46:52,64
that he wants to live.


2090
1:46:52,64 --> 1:47:1,258



2091
1:47:1,258 --> 1:47:4,31
It sounds so stupid, but
I feel like I can


2092
1:47:4,31 --> 1:47:6,75
almost smell his fart.


2093
1:47:6,75 --> 1:47:8,0
It smells good.


2094
1:47:8,0 --> 1:47:15,63



2095
1:47:15,63 --> 1:47:16,24
BETH HOYT: OK, guys.


2096
1:47:16,24 --> 1:47:17,882
That's a tough, tough
road for Nick.


2097
1:47:17,882 --> 1:47:20,9
Tell you what, it's been hard
for me tonight, too.


2098
1:47:20,9 --> 1:47:22,98
I came in and the hairdresser
said I was having a bad hair


2099
1:47:22,98 --> 1:47:24,88
day, but she fixed it.


2100
1:47:24,88 --> 1:47:26,51
So that's why I look
like Heidi.


2101
1:47:26,51 --> 1:47:28,26
But ladies and gentleman, don't
worry about it, because


2102
1:47:28,26 --> 1:47:31,68
please welcome Nick Thune
featuring The Narcs.


2103
1:47:31,68 --> 1:47:42,17



2104
1:47:42,17 --> 1:47:43,605
NICK THUNE: Thank you
guys so much.


2105
1:47:43,605 --> 1:47:47,79
I know it means a lot
for you to be here.


2106
1:47:47,79 --> 1:47:49,46
I'm honored to be in the front
row of your audience.


2107
1:47:49,46 --> 1:47:53,237



2108
1:47:53,237 --> 1:47:54,93
Could we get just a little more


2109
1:47:54,93 --> 1:47:57,68
laughter in these monitors?


2110
1:47:57,68 --> 1:47:59,3
Thank you.


2111
1:47:59,3 --> 1:48:4,2



2112
1:48:4,2 --> 1:48:7,5
I know you guys are looking at
me and you're thinking, this


2113
1:48:7,5 --> 1:48:8,3
guy's an athlete.


2114
1:48:8,3 --> 1:48:10,92



2115
1:48:10,92 --> 1:48:11,65
And I love sports.


2116
1:48:11,65 --> 1:48:13,4
I'm not going to tell you guys
I don't love sports.


2117
1:48:13,4 --> 1:48:14,51
I do.


2118
1:48:14,51 --> 1:48:15,72
But I don't play any sports.


2119
1:48:15,72 --> 1:48:16,78
What's my favorite sport?


2120
1:48:16,78 --> 1:48:17,11
Thank you.


2121
1:48:17,11 --> 1:48:19,51
Great question.


2122
1:48:19,51 --> 1:48:23,3
I'd say my favorite sport's
a back flip.


2123
1:48:23,3 --> 1:48:25,54
It's just a guy on the streets,
jumping up, no


2124
1:48:25,54 --> 1:48:29,1
trampoline, no diving board.


2125
1:48:29,1 --> 1:48:30,88
The cement.


2126
1:48:30,88 --> 1:48:33,34
A guy who can jump off the
ground, flip his whole body


2127
1:48:33,34 --> 1:48:35,99
around backwards and land on his
feet, any time of the day,


2128
1:48:35,99 --> 1:48:39,63
any street, any pair of
shoes in their closet.


2129
1:48:39,63 --> 1:48:40,85
I'm not talking about
back handsprings.


2130
1:48:40,85 --> 1:48:43,35
I'm not talking about
cartwheels.


2131
1:48:43,35 --> 1:48:45,13
Nick, do you have a joke
about back flips?


2132
1:48:45,13 --> 1:48:46,44
Another great question
from the back.


2133
1:48:46,44 --> 1:48:48,57
No.


2134
1:48:48,57 --> 1:48:51,24
I'm-- right now, and knowing
that there's at least hundreds


2135
1:48:51,24 --> 1:48:56,46
of people watching this live,
for me to just to get the word


2136
1:48:56,46 --> 1:48:57,88
out there-- back flip
awarenesss--


2137
1:48:57,88 --> 1:48:59,8
and if I can get that
camera to zoom in on


2138
1:48:59,8 --> 1:49:2,4
my face right now.


2139
1:49:2,4 --> 1:49:3,45
Teach your children
back flips.


2140
1:49:3,45 --> 1:49:6,2
If you're a child,
learn back flips.


2141
1:49:6,2 --> 1:49:11,7
It's never too late, unless
you're over 15.


2142
1:49:11,7 --> 1:49:11,475
That's it.


2143
1:49:11,475 --> 1:49:12,89
That's just the public
service part.


2144
1:49:12,89 --> 1:49:14,62
If you have a stage, you've got
to use it sometimes for


2145
1:49:14,62 --> 1:49:15,87
the right thing.


2146
1:49:15,87 --> 1:49:17,95



2147
1:49:17,95 --> 1:49:21,38
Now that that's behind us,
again, thank you guys for


2148
1:49:21,38 --> 1:49:21,8
being here.


2149
1:49:21,8 --> 1:49:23,59
And I want to tell you a little
story about something


2150
1:49:23,59 --> 1:49:25,26
that happened to me recently
at the bank.


2151
1:49:25,26 --> 1:49:36,87
[MUSIC]


2152
1:49:36,87 --> 1:49:41,8
I was at the bank,
pretty crowded.


2153
1:49:41,8 --> 1:49:43,48
Standing in line for 90 minutes,
an hour and a half.


2154
1:49:43,48 --> 1:49:47,48
I don't want anyone doing math
out there right now.


2155
1:49:47,48 --> 1:49:50,27
Hour and a half in line at the
bank, it's inappropriate.


2156
1:49:50,27 --> 1:49:51,13
It's unacceptable.


2157
1:49:51,13 --> 1:49:54,36
And ATMs are down outside.


2158
1:49:54,36 --> 1:49:56,3
All the pens aren't working.


2159
1:49:56,3 --> 1:49:57,79
You've all been there.


2160
1:49:57,79 --> 1:50:0,36
At one point a fire marshal
comes and says, listen up,


2161
1:50:0,36 --> 1:50:2,83
we're at maximum capacity.


2162
1:50:2,83 --> 1:50:4,5
Nobody's coming in this
bank until somebody


2163
1:50:4,5 --> 1:50:5,43
walks out of this bank.


2164
1:50:5,43 --> 1:50:7,51
I'm running it like a
fucking dance club.


2165
1:50:7,51 --> 1:50:9,9
Excuse my language.


2166
1:50:9,9 --> 1:50:11,2
He walked out.


2167
1:50:11,2 --> 1:50:13,18
There's a line around
the corner.


2168
1:50:13,18 --> 1:50:14,43
Lot of banking needs.


2169
1:50:14,43 --> 1:50:17,66



2170
1:50:17,66 --> 1:50:20,81
When I finally got up to the
teller, I was right.


2171
1:50:20,81 --> 1:50:22,6
She was a C-cup.


2172
1:50:22,6 --> 1:50:24,63



2173
1:50:24,63 --> 1:50:27,95
She was this amazing C-cup.


2174
1:50:27,95 --> 1:50:29,73
I started to open up a second
savings account.


2175
1:50:29,73 --> 1:50:31,25
I don't have money in my
first savings account.


2176
1:50:31,25 --> 1:50:31,97
I'm just--


2177
1:50:31,97 --> 1:50:35,4
just trying to create
conversation.


2178
1:50:35,4 --> 1:50:37,83
And as I'm talking to C-cup,
having the time of both of our


2179
1:50:37,83 --> 1:50:43,12
lives, a gentleman walks
into the bank.


2180
1:50:43,12 --> 1:50:44,9
Kitty-corner from where I'm
standing, from here to the


2181
1:50:44,9 --> 1:50:49,35
other end, a regular guy, got a
baby in his left arm, about


2182
1:50:49,35 --> 1:50:49,94
two months old.


2183
1:50:49,94 --> 1:50:53,2
It's a beautiful kid.


2184
1:50:53,2 --> 1:50:55,25
I'd seen maybe about 30 kids
that day, it was the best


2185
1:50:55,25 --> 1:50:58,6
looking baby I'd seen.


2186
1:50:58,6 --> 1:51:2,18
In his right hand he
had a handgun.


2187
1:51:2,18 --> 1:51:4,77
This guy jumps up on a table
disrupting everybody's


2188
1:51:4,77 --> 1:51:8,8
business in that bank and
screams out, I will shoot!


2189
1:51:8,8 --> 1:51:13,93
I will shoot this fucking baby
in the face right now, right


2190
1:51:13,93 --> 1:51:17,981
now, unless somebody in this
bank does a fucking back flip.


2191
1:51:17,981 --> 1:51:23,64



2192
1:51:23,64 --> 1:51:24,53
People are freaking out.


2193
1:51:24,53 --> 1:51:25,61
Nobody could do a back flip.


2194
1:51:25,61 --> 1:51:26,67
Everybody know it.


2195
1:51:26,67 --> 1:51:28,11
C-cup's bouncing all
over the place.


2196
1:51:28,11 --> 1:51:30,35
I got to calm her down.


2197
1:51:30,35 --> 1:51:33,4
I said, listen, don't press
the red button.


2198
1:51:33,4 --> 1:51:34,87
Don't press-- we've
seen every movie.


2199
1:51:34,87 --> 1:51:35,84
We know where the
red button is.


2200
1:51:35,84 --> 1:51:36,675
It's under the table.


2201
1:51:36,675 --> 1:51:39,59
If you press it, the
cops are coming.


2202
1:51:39,59 --> 1:51:41,14
This guy doesn't
want any money.


2203
1:51:41,14 --> 1:51:43,985
He just wants to see
a back flip.


2204
1:51:43,985 --> 1:51:47,67
There's nothing illegal
about that.


2205
1:51:47,67 --> 1:51:50,77
Just give me two minutes,
let me talk to him.


2206
1:51:50,77 --> 1:51:54,45
She said, will you
come back for me?


2207
1:51:54,45 --> 1:51:57,96
And I said, yeah, now I will.


2208
1:51:57,96 --> 1:52:0,65
When I walked across the bank
everybody got out of my way.


2209
1:52:0,65 --> 1:52:2,16
Why?


2210
1:52:2,16 --> 1:52:5,3
Because everybody wants to see
a back flip, that's why.


2211
1:52:5,3 --> 1:52:5,83
They're amazing.


2212
1:52:5,83 --> 1:52:6,99
Are people worried
about the baby?


2213
1:52:6,99 --> 1:52:7,82
Great question.


2214
1:52:7,82 --> 1:52:9,24
No.


2215
1:52:9,24 --> 1:52:11,1
No one gives a shit about
that when there's a


2216
1:52:11,1 --> 1:52:12,28
million babies out there.


2217
1:52:12,28 --> 1:52:15,62
Two people know this
specific one.


2218
1:52:15,62 --> 1:52:17,415
No, no one's worried
about that baby.


2219
1:52:17,415 --> 1:52:20,43



2220
1:52:20,43 --> 1:52:22,75
When I get to the middle of the
bank a circle forms around


2221
1:52:22,75 --> 1:52:25,17
me like I'm in the middle of
some kind of dance facility.


2222
1:52:25,17 --> 1:52:30,3



2223
1:52:30,3 --> 1:52:34,16
I looked up at the guy with the
baby and I said listen, I


2224
1:52:34,16 --> 1:52:35,36
didn't hear what you said.


2225
1:52:35,36 --> 1:52:40,1
I was talking to my lady
friend back there.


2226
1:52:40,1 --> 1:52:42,9
He said, I'm going to shoot this
baby in the face, that's


2227
1:52:42,9 --> 1:52:46,35
what I said, unless
I see a back flip.


2228
1:52:46,35 --> 1:52:49,64
I said it doesn't have
to be like that.


2229
1:52:49,64 --> 1:52:51,5
He said, I need to see
one pretty bad.


2230
1:52:51,5 --> 1:52:53,77



2231
1:52:53,77 --> 1:52:56,29
And I understood him.


2232
1:52:56,29 --> 1:53:0,12
I understood what he
was going through.


2233
1:53:0,12 --> 1:53:1,27
I looked over to my right.


2234
1:53:1,27 --> 1:53:2,37
Cuba Gooding Ju--


2235
1:53:2,37 --> 1:53:3,62
Cuba Gooding Joinier--


2236
1:53:3,62 --> 1:53:5,82



2237
1:53:5,82 --> 1:53:8,17
Cuba Gooding Junior was standing
in the corner.


2238
1:53:8,17 --> 1:53:10,55
He had a cast on his left leg,
he's got crutches under each


2239
1:53:10,55 --> 1:53:11,54
arm, he's injured.


2240
1:53:11,54 --> 1:53:13,29
We've seen Jerry Maguire.


2241
1:53:13,29 --> 1:53:14,55
We've seen his Wikipedia page.


2242
1:53:14,55 --> 1:53:16,4
We know he can do back flips.


2243
1:53:16,4 --> 1:53:19,7
We know he does his
own stunts.


2244
1:53:19,7 --> 1:53:20,57
And there he is.


2245
1:53:20,57 --> 1:53:23,79
Rod Tidwell's injured
on the sideline.


2246
1:53:23,79 --> 1:53:25,18
Probably the biggest game
of his life, he


2247
1:53:25,18 --> 1:53:28,35
can't do a back flip.


2248
1:53:28,35 --> 1:53:29,6
It's up to me.


2249
1:53:29,6 --> 1:53:31,78



2250
1:53:31,78 --> 1:53:32,64
So I just jumped.


2251
1:53:32,64 --> 1:53:35,29
I know that's step one.


2252
1:53:35,29 --> 1:53:39,41
I started leaning
back, step two.


2253
1:53:39,41 --> 1:53:40,99
Next thing I know, I
land on my feet.


2254
1:53:40,99 --> 1:53:42,1
Everybody sits down.


2255
1:53:42,1 --> 1:53:44,6
They stand back up.


2256
1:53:44,6 --> 1:53:46,686
That's a standing ovation
in my country.


2257
1:53:46,686 --> 1:53:49,11
They let me keep the baby,
I didn't see that coming.


2258
1:53:49,11 --> 1:53:51,78



2259
1:53:51,78 --> 1:53:54,25
When I was walking out of that
bank for a late lunch with


2260
1:53:54,25 --> 1:53:59,99
Cuba, C-cup comes bouncing
up behind me.


2261
1:53:59,99 --> 1:54:4,9
And she says, Mr. Thune, Mr.
Thune, before you go I just


2262
1:54:4,9 --> 1:54:6,67
want to know we caught that
whole back flip on our


2263
1:54:6,67 --> 1:54:9,73
security cameras.


2264
1:54:9,73 --> 1:54:12,18
My dad works at YouTube.


2265
1:54:12,18 --> 1:54:13,43
I could cut a video together.


2266
1:54:13,43 --> 1:54:14,5
We could get it on
the front page.


2267
1:54:14,5 --> 1:54:16,3
I mean, maybe not this week,
it's Comedy Week, but


2268
1:54:16,3 --> 1:54:18,56
definitely next week.


2269
1:54:18,56 --> 1:54:22,98
And you're going to be a hero
all over the world wide web.


2270
1:54:22,98 --> 1:54:25,94



2271
1:54:25,94 --> 1:54:27,783
I just need you to sign this
release form and then we'll


2272
1:54:27,783 --> 1:54:30,7
put the footage out there.


2273
1:54:30,7 --> 1:54:33,25
And I said no.


2274
1:54:33,25 --> 1:54:36,43
Thanks but no thanks, C-cup.


2275
1:54:36,43 --> 1:54:39,87
I didn't do this back
flip to be a hero.


2276
1:54:39,87 --> 1:54:43,49
I did this back flip
to be a father.


2277
1:54:43,49 --> 1:54:45,63
And right now the most important
thing to me is I


2278
1:54:45,63 --> 1:54:47,87
want to be a good dad to Nick
junior and I want to be a good


2279
1:54:47,87 --> 1:54:50,48
friend to Cuba Gooding Junior.


2280
1:54:50,48 --> 1:54:51,37
We named him after both of us.


2281
1:54:51,37 --> 1:54:52,62
He took Cuba's last name.


2282
1:54:52,62 --> 1:54:56,63



2283
1:54:56,63 --> 1:54:59,21
I said, so you can't
put it online.


2284
1:54:59,21 --> 1:55:2,87
And as I turned to walk away
she said, but Nick, we just


2285
1:55:2,87 --> 1:55:6,74
caught everything you
said on camera.


2286
1:55:6,74 --> 1:55:9,56
And I said yeah, I know.


2287
1:55:9,56 --> 1:55:12,25
Now you can put it on YouTube.


2288
1:55:12,25 --> 1:55:13,23
Thank you guys.


2289
1:55:13,23 --> 1:55:16,17
You're welcome.


2290
1:55:16,17 --> 1:55:17,42
Keep it going for The Narcs.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

1:55:34,57 --> 1:55:39,81
-Three time LPGA champion Linda
Munns is back, but not


2294
1:55:39,81 --> 1:55:41,17
on the course.


2295
1:55:41,17 --> 1:55:44,1
She's out of prison and headed
to your kids' school to talk


2296
1:55:44,1 --> 1:55:45,695
to them about drugs.


2297
1:55:45,695 --> 1:55:46,19
Hey, Linda.


2298
1:55:46,19 --> 1:55:47,18
Who's that cutie?


2299
1:55:47,18 --> 1:55:47,71
-Hey, guys.


2300
1:55:47,71 --> 1:55:51,9
This is my friend Little Linda
and you can tell she's been


2301
1:55:51,9 --> 1:55:54,27
smoking a little bit
of marijuana today.


2302
1:55:54,27 --> 1:55:57,65
Linda, marijuana is bad.


2303
1:55:57,65 --> 1:55:58,66
-No, girl.


2304
1:55:58,66 --> 1:55:59,91
It's good.


2305
1:55:59,91 --> 1:56:2,184



2306
1:56:2,184 --> 1:56:5,67
You used to be a lot more
fun when you smoked.


2307
1:56:5,67 --> 1:56:6,75
-That's true.


2308
1:56:6,75 --> 1:56:9,69
But that's what caused me to
crash my Miata into that

Linda Munns they'll never


2311
1:56:13,34 --> 1:56:17,2
smoke marijuana, guaranteed.


2312
1:56:17,2 --> 1:56:19,6
Watch Linda deal with
peer pressure.


2313
1:56:19,6 --> 1:56:23,78
-You could take a puff of this
sweet green shag carpet and


2314
1:56:23,78 --> 1:56:27,7
have everything back that
you used to have.


2315
1:56:27,7 --> 1:56:30,34
-Nice try, Little Linda.


2316
1:56:30,34 --> 1:56:33,44
I'm stronger than you, drugs.


2317
1:56:33,44 --> 1:56:35,47
-She's talking diet.


2318
1:56:35,47 --> 1:56:37,3
-Gimme, gimme.


2319
1:56:37,3 --> 1:56:38,54
-Linda, that's junk food.


2320
1:56:38,54 --> 1:56:40,23
You're going to get fat.

-You can't do a push-up.

going to have to


2331

stab people to survive.

natural high from exercise?


2337
1:57:19,78 --> 1:57:21,29
-Screw that.


2338
1:57:21,29 --> 1:57:25,3
I just want to watch Borat
and masturbate.

-And she's handing out quan.

1:57:27,71 --> 1:57:28,758
-It's fresh quan.


2341
1:57:28,758 --> 1:57:32,26

-Man, Linda, maybe I
should quit smoking


2348
1:57:47,26 --> 1:57:48,51
and be a better person.

Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Nice Peter.


2363
1:58:43,71 --> 1:58:47,786



2364
1:58:47,786 --> 1:58:49,18
NICE PETER: Hi.


2365
1:58:49,18 --> 1:58:51,79
This is a song about
the internet.


2366
1:58:51,79 --> 1:58:52,64
Kind of.


2367
1:58:52,64 --> 1:58:54,253
One, two--


2368
1:58:54,253 --> 2:0:56,68
[MUSIC]


2369
2:0:56,68 --> 2:0:57,93
Thank you so much.


2370
2:0:57,93 --> 2:1:1,254



2371
2:1:1,254 --> 2:1:3,39
So this next song is very
important because we have a--


2372
2:1:3,39 --> 2:1:4,985
we have an important
guest with us.


2373
2:1:4,985 --> 2:1:6,34
There's a young man
named Devin.


2374
2:1:6,34 --> 2:1:7,756
Devin, are you out
there somewhere?


2375
2:1:7,756 --> 2:1:8,78
Hey, Devin, how's it going?


2376
2:1:8,78 --> 2:1:10,37
Devin, why don't you
come up on stage?


2377
2:1:10,37 --> 2:1:13,47
So let me tell you a little bit
about Devin, and uh, well,


2378
2:1:13,47 --> 2:1:14,27
I'll tell you a little story.


2379
2:1:14,27 --> 2:1:17,52
So about six months ago I
realized that I had been


2380
2:1:17,52 --> 2:1:21,49
losing my hair for approximately
17,000 years and


2381
2:1:21,49 --> 2:1:23,66
I decided to just take the
plunge and shave my head.


2382
2:1:23,66 --> 2:1:26,9
So about, it was in
last May, Devin--


2383
2:1:26,9 --> 2:1:28,543
Devin kicked the crap out of
cancer, that's what Devin did.


2384
2:1:28,543 --> 2:1:31,72
I never had to do that.


2385
2:1:31,72 --> 2:1:33,98
But, you know, part of kicking
the crap out of cancer means


2386
2:1:33,98 --> 2:1:36,16
you've got to go through
chemotherapy and get a lot of


2387
2:1:36,16 --> 2:1:38,63
chemicals in your body and it
messes with your hair and


2388
2:1:38,63 --> 2:1:39,89
that's what happens.


2389
2:1:39,89 --> 2:1:42,52
So your hair starts falling out
and being weird and it's


2390
2:1:42,52 --> 2:1:44,95
one of those things you just
kind of take the plunge on and


2391
2:1:44,95 --> 2:1:45,77
you've got to do it.


2392
2:1:45,77 --> 2:1:47,87
So tonight we're going to shave
Devin's head right here


2393
2:1:47,87 --> 2:1:50,1
on stage while we sing
a song to him.


2394
2:1:50,1 --> 2:1:51,28
That's a good thing,
you can clap.


2395
2:1:51,28 --> 2:1:53,83
Not just because, I mean--.


2396
2:1:53,83 --> 2:1:57,17
But the thing is, when I dealt
with it was tricky.


2397
2:1:57,17 --> 2:1:57,69
It was hard.


2398
2:1:57,69 --> 2:1:59,79
I didn't even have to beat
cancer in the process and it


2399
2:1:59,79 --> 2:2:1,21
was still emotionally
difficult.


2400
2:2:1,21 --> 2:2:3,74
But I had my subscribers out
there-- hi, if you're out


2401
2:2:3,74 --> 2:2:5,5
there-- and they kind of helped
me through the whole


2402
2:2:5,5 --> 2:2:6,27
experience.


2403
2:2:6,27 --> 2:2:8,22
I made a video about it and
shaved my head in the video


2404
2:2:8,22 --> 2:2:9,96
and they were all very
supportive and nice.


2405
2:2:9,96 --> 2:2:13,72
So tonight if you're out there
on the comment boards, stop


2406
2:2:13,72 --> 2:2:15,67
typing hateful things that
are misspelled for


2407
2:2:15,67 --> 2:2:16,82
one second and let's--


2408
2:2:16,82 --> 2:2:18,42
let's all be Devlin
subscribers.


2409
2:2:18,42 --> 2:2:19,376
We're-- we're--


2410
2:2:19,376 --> 2:2:21,856
I subscribe to you,
Devin-- hello!


2411
2:2:21,856 --> 2:2:25,41
So if you could say hi to the
people at home-- don't worry


2412
2:2:25,41 --> 2:2:26,82
about these people, they're
not real-- look at


2413
2:2:26,82 --> 2:2:27,55
how purple they are.


2414
2:2:27,55 --> 2:2:28,75
No one is that purple.


2415
2:2:28,75 --> 2:2:30,0
Say hi to the people at
home, and all the


2416
2:2:30,0 --> 2:2:32,19
people, say hi to Devin.


2417
2:2:32,19 --> 2:2:33,51
You guys can say hi
to Devin, too.


2418
2:2:33,51 --> 2:2:34,74
I'm just kidding.


2419
2:2:34,74 --> 2:2:36,37
So we have my friend
Sue Lions here.


2420
2:2:36,37 --> 2:2:37,2
Sue Lions, come out.


2421
2:2:37,2 --> 2:2:39,55
She's going to help us and she's
going to shave his head.


2422
2:2:39,55 --> 2:2:40,72
So we're going to do
this all together.


2423
2:2:40,72 --> 2:2:41,37
This is a moment.


2424
2:2:41,37 --> 2:2:43,89
We're going to help him
take the plunge.


2425
2:2:43,89 --> 2:2:45,79
Any other guys out there losing
their hair right here


2426
2:2:45,79 --> 2:2:46,32
in the audience?


2427
2:2:46,32 --> 2:2:47,44
Anyone?


2428
2:2:47,44 --> 2:2:49,325
It's kind of-- yeah,
it's a pain, man.


2429
2:2:49,325 --> 2:2:50,81
That guy's like, yeah!


2430
2:2:50,81 --> 2:2:51,56
That's all right!


2431
2:2:51,56 --> 2:2:53,15
Tonight, we're the cool guys!


2432
2:2:53,15 --> 2:2:54,444
It's you and me!


2433
2:2:54,444 --> 2:2:56,1
Hey man, look at the
hair on that dork.


2434
2:2:56,1 --> 2:2:58,48
Nice hair, dork.


2435
2:2:58,48 --> 2:3:0,34
And there's some people
at home probably too.


2436
2:3:0,34 --> 2:3:1,28
So this is our moment.


2437
2:3:1,28 --> 2:3:3,19
This is our shiny-headed
moment.


2438
2:3:3,19 --> 2:3:7,24
I see the future in your head.

go into a bank.

2:6:43,79 --> 2:6:44,37
BETH HOYT: Hi, guys.


2463
2:6:44,37 --> 2:6:45,48
It's me, Beth, again.


2464
2:6:45,48 --> 2:6:46,18
I'm here with you.


2465
2:6:46,18 --> 2:6:48,17
I feel like I'm the baby
sitter and then the--


2466
2:6:48,17 --> 2:6:49,73
before the parents come out.


2467
2:6:49,73 --> 2:6:50,91
I babysat.


2468
2:6:50,91 --> 2:6:52,98
Well, I had a babysitting
job when I was 10.


2469
2:6:52,98 --> 2:6:54,77
My first one I babysat twins--


2470
2:6:54,77 --> 2:6:56,29
this is just me time.


2471
2:6:56,29 --> 2:6:58,15
I'm talking to you about
how I babysat twins.


2472
2:6:58,15 --> 2:6:58,91
I lost one of them--


2473
2:6:58,91 --> 2:6:59,37
Diane--


2474
2:6:59,37 --> 2:7:0,38
I never found her.


2475
2:7:0,38 --> 2:7:1,44
I-- the parents came home.


2476
2:7:1,44 --> 2:7:2,76
I said Diane is--


2477
2:7:2,76 --> 2:7:4,3
they're playing hide and seek.


2478
2:7:4,3 --> 2:7:6,88
So this is my chance
to ask the world if


2479
2:7:6,88 --> 2:7:8,38
Diane has been found.


2480
2:7:8,38 --> 2:7:9,22
But I was only 10.


2481
2:7:9,22 --> 2:7:10,77
It's not really my fault.


2482
2:7:10,77 --> 2:7:11,9
Here's what I think.


2483
2:7:11,9 --> 2:7:13,38
How old is someone who's 10?


2484
2:7:13,38 --> 2:7:15,47
I don't know the difference
of the like, four to 11.


2485
2:7:15,47 --> 2:7:16,47
Especially--


2486
2:7:16,47 --> 2:7:19,89
I live in New York City and I
feel like kids there, like you


2487
2:7:19,89 --> 2:7:21,66
ask them, how old are you?


2488
2:7:21,66 --> 2:7:22,71
Can you show me with
your fingers?


2489
2:7:22,71 --> 2:7:24,75
And they're like, we're going to
be late for Mandarin class.


2490
2:7:24,75 --> 2:7:26,9
I'm like, I totally
missed that one.


2491
2:7:26,9 --> 2:7:28,62
But guess what I didn't
miss, is that our next


2492
2:7:28,62 --> 2:7:29,86
performer is ready.


2493
2:7:29,86 --> 2:7:33,15
And he is a titan in the
musical comedy scene.


2494
2:7:33,15 --> 2:7:36,8
He stars in the IFC TV series
"Comedy Bang Bang," and he has


2495
2:7:36,8 --> 2:7:38,95
performed with acts like Regina
Spektor, [? Bergy ?]

2:11:50,94 --> 2:11:53,3
He does lots of voices.


2556
2:11:53,3 --> 2:11:55,4
Let's see, I can do things
with my face.


2557
2:11:55,4 --> 2:11:55,93
I will show you guys.


2558
2:11:55,93 --> 2:11:59,1
This is my impression of Claire
Danes when she found


2559
2:11:59,1 --> 2:12:2,17
out she was going
to have a baby.


2560
2:12:2,17 --> 2:12:3,81
This is for all you guys.


2561
2:12:3,81 --> 2:12:6,8
It's for all of them.


2562
2:12:6,8 --> 2:12:7,42
This is my impression of you.


2563
2:12:7,42 --> 2:12:8,67
OK.


2564
2:12:8,67 --> 2:12:10,96



2565
2:12:10,96 --> 2:12:14,88
That's when you think you left
your iPhone at the restaurant.


2566
2:12:14,88 --> 2:12:17,65
This is my impression of
Claire Danes when--


2567
2:12:17,65 --> 2:12:19,34
when she orders a salad.


2568
2:12:19,34 --> 2:12:20,87
OK.


2569
2:12:20,87 --> 2:12:21,78
I missed something.


2570
2:12:21,78 --> 2:12:23,636
There's something else I want.


2571
2:12:23,636 --> 2:12:25,97
Um.


2572
2:12:25,97 --> 2:12:26,59
Oh, you guys got--


2573
2:12:26,59 --> 2:12:29,27
that translated.


2574
2:12:29,27 --> 2:12:30,63
Um, here's another
one for you guys.


2575
2:12:30,63 --> 2:12:33,13
This is when you get an
email from Louis CK.


2576
2:12:33,13 --> 2:12:36,46



2577
2:12:36,46 --> 2:12:37,71
Right, because you know,
everybody, so.


2578
2:12:37,71 --> 2:12:39,72



2579
2:12:39,72 --> 2:12:40,34
Guess what?


2580
2:12:40,34 --> 2:12:43,69
Our final performer for the
evening is a legend in music


2581
2:12:43,69 --> 2:12:47,93
comedy, comedy music, comedy
comedy, and music music.


2582
2:12:47,93 --> 2:12:51,66
He's sold millions of albums,
been on hundreds of TV shows,


2583
2:12:51,66 --> 2:12:53,5
and toured the world.


2584
2:12:53,5 --> 2:12:55,135
And his work is the inspiration
for everyone on


2585
2:12:55,135 --> 2:12:56,8
the show tonight.


2586
2:12:56,8 --> 2:12:58,83
He's got a tour this summer, a
children's book available for


2587
2:12:58,83 --> 2:13:1,94
pre order, and even a spot set
for Bonnaroo this year.


2588
2:13:1,94 --> 2:13:4,56
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome the godfather of


2589
2:13:4,56 --> 2:13:6,42
musical comedy, Weird
Al Yankovic!


2590
2:13:6,42 --> 2:13:10,93



2591
2:13:10,93 --> 2:15:46,5
WEIRD AL YANKOVIC: [MUSIC]


2592
2:15:46,5 --> 2:15:47,494
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen!


2593
2:15:47,494 --> 2:15:47,991
Thank you!


2594
2:15:47,991 --> 2:15:49,241
Thank you!


2595
2:15:49,241 --> 2:16:3,895



2596
2:16:3,895 --> 2:16:5,8
BETH HOYT: That was awesome!


2597
2:16:5,8 --> 2:16:7,26
Were we going to be like--


2598
2:16:7,26 --> 2:16:8,22
I'm fine.


2599
2:16:8,22 --> 2:16:9,67
Oh, come on.


2600
2:16:9,67 --> 2:16:12,19
You guys, I did it
all for you.


2601
2:16:12,19 --> 2:16:13,75
That was amazing.


2602
2:16:13,75 --> 2:16:15,91
Have you seen a digger
like that?


2603
2:16:15,91 --> 2:16:17,68
I wish I could see it.


2604
2:16:17,68 --> 2:16:19,67
Everybody, that is Comedy Week.


2605
2:16:19,67 --> 2:16:20,91
I--


2606
2:16:20,91 --> 2:16:22,49
could I have planned that
pratfall better?


2607
2:16:22,49 --> 2:16:23,71
OK.


2608
2:16:23,71 --> 2:16:24,77
Wow, was amazing.


2609
2:16:24,77 --> 2:16:27,86
We've seen stand up, improv,
Set List, and music.


2610
2:16:27,86 --> 2:16:30,6
Thank you to everyone who made
it happen, especially the


2611
2:16:30,6 --> 2:16:32,425
comics and improvisers
who gave so much.


2612
2:16:32,425 --> 2:16:34,379
We've had a blast doing it and
we can't wait to do it again.


2613
2:16:34,379 --> 2:16:41,1



2614
2:16:41,1 --> 2:16:43,36
So the teleprompter has stopped
working so I'm going


2615
2:16:43,36 --> 2:16:44,629
to go ahead and say it.


2616
2:16:44,629 --> 2:16:47,44
Everyone who watched gets
free Google Glasses.


2617
2:16:47,44 --> 2:16:47,99
Pretty sure--


2618
2:16:47,99 --> 2:16:49,41
I'm pretty sure I'm supposed
to say that.


2619
2:16:49,41 --> 2:16:52,59
OK, watch your email
for details.


2620
2:16:52,59 --> 2:16:53,58
Special thanks to everyone
who watched.


2621
2:16:53,58 --> 2:16:55,77
Thank you for making the
week such a success.


2622
2:16:55,77 --> 2:16:56,92
Good night!


2623
2:16:56,92 --> 2:16:57,52
Yeah.


2624
2:16:57,52 --> 2:16:58,12
Thank you so much!


2625
2:16:58,12 --> 2:18:58,12
