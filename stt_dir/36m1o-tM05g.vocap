###18 Hello everyone.
###20 I'm Sam,
###21 and I just turned 17.
###24 A few years ago, before my freshman year in High School,
###27 I wanted to play snare drum in the Foxboro High School Marching Band,
###32 and it was a dream that I just had to accomplish.
###35 But each snare drum and harness
###37 weighed about 40 pounds each,
###40 and I have a disease called Progeria.
###42 So just to give you an idea, I weigh only about 50 pounds.
###46 So, logistically, I really couldn't carry a regular sized snare drum,
###51 and because of this the band director assigned me to play
###55 pit percussion during the halftime show.
###59 Now pit percussion was fun.
###61 It involved some really cool auxiliary percussion instruments,
###64 like the bongos, timpani,
###68 and timbales, and cowbell.
###71 So it was fun,
###73 but it involved no marching, and I was just so devastated.
###78 However, nothing was going to stop me
###80 from playing snare drum with the marching band
###83 in the halftime show.
###85 So my family and I worked with an engineer to design
###89 a snare drum harness
###91 that would be lighter, and easier for me to carry.
###95 So after continuous work, we made
###99 a snare drum apparatus that weighs only about 6 pounds.
###103 (Applause)
###108 I just want to give you some more information about Progeria.
###112 It affects only about 350 kids today, worldwide.
###118 So it's pretty rare,
###120 and the effects of Progeria include:
###123 tight skin, lack of weight gain, stunted growth,
###127 and heart disease.
###129 Last year my Mom and her team of scientists
###132 published the first successful Progeria Treatment Study,
###136 and because of this I was interviewed on NPR,
###139 and John Hamilton asked me the question:
###142 "What is the most important thing
###144 that people should know about you?"
###146 And my answer was simply that
###149 I have a very happy life.
###151 (Applause)
###155 So even though there are many obstacles in my life,
###159 with a lot of them being created by Progeria,
###162 I don't want people to feel bad for me.
###165 I don't think about these obstacles all the time,
###167 and I'm able to overcome most of them anyway.
###171 So I’m here today, to share with you my philosophy for a happy life.
###176 So, for me, there are 3 aspects to this philosophy.
###180 So this is a quote from the famous Ferris Bueller.
###184 The first aspect to my philosophy is that
###188 I’m okay with what I ultimately can’t do
###191 because there is so much I can do.
###194 Now people sometimes ask me questions like,
###196 &quot;Isn’t it hard living with Progeria?&quot;, or
###199 "What daily challenges of Progeria do you face?"
###202 And I’d like to say that, even though I have Progeria,
###206 most of my time is spent thinking about things
###208 that have nothing to do with Progeria at all.
###211 Now this doesn’t mean that I ignore the negative aspects of these obstacles.
###216 When I can’t do something like
###218 run a long distance, or go on an intense roller coaster,
###222 I know what I’m missing out on.
###224 But instead, I choose to focus on the activities
###228 that I can do through things that I’m passionate about,
###232 like scouting, or music, or comic books,
###235 or any of my favorite Boston sports teams.
###238 Yeah, so -- (Laughter)
###241 However, sometimes I need to find a different way to do something
###246 by making adjustments,
###247 and I want to put those things in the "can do" category.
###251 Kind of like you saw with the drum earlier.
###254 So here’s a clip
###256 with me playing Spider-Man
###258 with the Foxboro High School Marching Band
###261 at halftime a couple of years ago.
###263 (Video)
###266 ♫ Spider-Man theme song ♫
###307 (Applause)
###310 Thank you.
###312 All right, all right, so --
###314 That was pretty cool,
###316 and so I was able to accomplish my dream
###319 of playing snare drum with the marching band,
###322 as I believe I can do for all of my dreams.
###325 So hopefully, you can accomplish your dreams as well, with this outlook.
###330 The next aspect to my philosophy is
###332 that I surround myself with people I want to be with,
###336 people of high quality.
###338 I’m extremely lucky to have an amazing family,
###342 who have always supported me throughout my entire life.
###346 And I’m also really fortunate to have
###348 a really close group of friends at school.
###351 Now we’re kind of goofy, a lot of us are band geeks,
###355 but we really enjoy each other’s company,
###357 and we help each other out when we need to.
###360 We see each other for who we are on the inside.
###364 So this is us goofing off a little bit.
###366 So we’re juniors in High School now,
###369 and we can now mentor younger band members,
###375 as a single collective unit.
###376 What I love about being in a group like the band,
###379 is that the music that we make together,
###382 is true, is genuine, and it supersedes Progeria.
###388 So I don’t have to worry about that
###389 when I’m feeling so good about making music.
###393 But even having made a documentary,
###396 going on TV a couple of times,
###398 I feel like I’m at my highest point
###401 when I’m with the people that surround me every day.
###405 They provide the real positive influences in my life,
###409 as I hope I can provide a positive influence in theirs as well.
###414 (Applause)
###418 Thank you.
###419 So the bottom line here,
###421 is that I hope you appreciate and love your family,
###425 love your friends, for you guys, love you Bro’s
###428 and acknowledge your mentors,
###431 and your community,
###433 because they are a very real aspect of everyday life,
###436 they can make a truly significant, positive impact.
###440 The third aspect to the philosophy is,
###443 Keep moving forward.
###445 Here’s a quote by a man you may know, named Walt Disney,
###449 and it’s one of my favorite quotes.
###451 I always try to have something to look forward to.
###454 Something to strive for to make my life richer.
###457 It doesn’t have to be big.
###458 It could be anything from
###461 looking forward to the next comic book to come out,
###463 or going on a large family vacation,
###466 or hanging out with my friends,
###468 to going to the next High School football game.
###471 However, all of these things keep me focused,
###475 and know that there’s a bright future ahead,
###477 and may get me through some difficult times that I may be having.
###482 Now this mentality includes staying in a forward thinking state of mind.
###487 I try hard not to waste energy feeling badly for myself,
###491 because when I do, I get stuck in a paradox,
###494 where there’s no room for any happiness or any other emotion.
###499 Now, it’s not that I ignore when I’m feeling badly,
###503 I kind of accept it,
###504 I let it in, so that I can acknowledge it,
###508 and do what I need to do to move past it.
###511 When I was younger, I wanted to be an engineer.
###515 I wanted to be an inventor,
###516 who would catapult the world into a better future.
###520 Maybe this came from my love of Legos,
###522 and the freedom of expression that I felt
###524 when I was building with them.
###527 And this was also derived from my family and my mentors,
###533 who always make me feel whole, and good about myself.
###537 Now today my ambitions have changed a little bit,
###541 I’d like to go into the field of Biology,
###543 maybe cell biology, or genetics,
###547 or biochemistry, or really anything.
###552 This is a friend of mine, who I look up to,
###555 Francis Collins, the director of the NIH,
###559 and this is us at TEDMED last year, chatting away.
###562 I feel that no matter what I choose to become,
###566 I believe that I can change the world.
###569 And as I’m striving to change the world, I will be happy.
###574 About four years ago,
###576 HBO began to film a documentary
###579 about my family and me called “Life According to Sam”.
###582 That was a pretty great experience, but it was also four years ago.
###586 And like anyone, my views on many things have changed,
###589 and hopefully matured, like my potential career choice.
###594 However, some things have stayed the same throughout that time.
###598 Like my mentality, and philosophy towards life.
###602 So I would like to show you
###604 a clip of my younger self from the film,
###607 that I feel embodies that philosophy.
###611 (Video)
###612 I know more about it genetically.
###616 So it’s less of an embodiment now.
###619 It used to be like
###621 this thing that prevents me from doing all this stuff,
###624 that causes other kids to die,
###626 that causes everybody to be stressed,
###629 and now it’s a protein that is abnormal,
###635 that weakens the structure of cells.
###640 So,
###642 and it takes a burden off of me because now
###645 I don’t have to think about
###648 Progeria as an entity.
###655 Okay, pretty good, huh?
###657 (Applause)
###661 Thank you.
###662 So, as you can see I’ve been thinking this way for many years.
###665 But I’d never really had to apply all of these aspects of my philosophy
###670 to the test at one time, until last January.
###674 I was pretty sick, I had a chest cold, and I was in the hospital for a few days,
###679 and I was secluded from all of the aspects of my life that I felt
###683 made me, me,
###685 that kind of gave me my identity.
###687 But knowing that I was going to get better,
###691 and looking forward to a time that I would feel good again,
###694 helped me to keep moving forward.
###696 And sometimes I had to be brave,
###699 and it wasn’t always easy.
###701 Sometimes I faltered,
###702 I had bad days,
###704 but I realized that being brave isn’t supposed to be easy.
###707 And for me, I feel it’s the key way to keep moving forward.
###711 So, all in all,
###714 I don’t waste energy feeling bad for myself.
###717 I surround myself with people that I want to be with,
###721 and I keep moving forward.
###723 So with this philosophy, I hope that all of you,
###726 regardless of your obstacles,
###728 can have a very happy life as well.
###731 Oh, wait, hang on a second,
###733 one more piece of advice –-
###735 (Laughter)
###737 Never miss a party if you can help it.
###739 My school’s homecoming dance is tomorrow night,
###742 and I will be there.
###744 Thank you very much.
###745 (Applause)
