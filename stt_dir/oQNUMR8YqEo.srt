1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:13,14



2
0:0:13,14 --> 0:0:16,55
JASON MCAFEE: His spiritual side
is all over the place, in


3
0:0:16,55 --> 0:0:17,81
a good way.


4
0:0:17,81 --> 0:0:20,46
I think Freddy believes and
dabbles in a little


5
0:0:20,46 --> 0:0:21,7
bit of all of it.


6
0:0:21,7 --> 0:0:24,59
JOHN ODA: My teacher, he's
a Tibetan Buddhist.


7
0:0:24,59 --> 0:0:26,5
This is called Gongfucha.


8
0:0:26,5 --> 0:0:28,3
It's like Kung Fu tea.


9
0:0:28,3 --> 0:0:31,37
And then if all the elements
are in the right proportion


10
0:0:31,37 --> 0:0:36,607
with care and good timing, then
it's like liquid gold.


11
0:0:36,607 --> 0:0:38,34
JASON MCAFEE: I really
enjoyed it.


12
0:0:38,34 --> 0:0:41,65
And it took me a few times
to realize what it was.


13
0:0:41,65 --> 0:0:44,1
I mean, there's a lot
of love behind it.


14
0:0:44,1 --> 0:0:48,23
What's really great about it,
too, is you actually sit


15
0:0:48,23 --> 0:0:49,642
together and talk.


16
0:0:49,642 --> 0:0:51,4
JOHN ODA: Apocalypto really
fucked me up.


17
0:0:51,4 --> 0:0:54,76
JASON MCAFEE: Yeah, dude,
that shit was crazy.


18
0:0:54,76 --> 0:0:58,1
When you saw the Royal Family
and how all the kids are all


19
0:0:58,1 --> 0:0:59,9
fat with all this jewelry.


20
0:0:59,9 --> 0:1:0,623
JOHN ODA: Yeah.


21
0:1:0,623 --> 0:1:3,3
JASON MCAFEE: There are times
we'll just like keep drinking


22
0:1:3,3 --> 0:1:4,976
and keep drinking, and we're
just like la, la, la, la.


23
0:1:4,976 --> 0:1:7,66



24
0:1:7,66 --> 0:1:11,98
We're just so caught up in our
chores, and day-to-day life,


25
0:1:11,98 --> 0:1:14,61
and television, and what's
going on on the news or


26
0:1:14,61 --> 0:1:17,89
whatever, that it's something
that's been going on for


27
0:1:17,89 --> 0:1:21,59
centuries that we can still
participate in, and I think


28
0:1:21,59 --> 0:1:25,5
that's really a magical
part of it, too.


29
0:1:25,5 --> 0:1:27,75
JOHN ODA: Did you guys
get it good?


30
0:1:27,75 --> 0:1:29,152
JASON MCAFEE: Yeah, I'm so glad
that we had to do this.


31
0:1:29,152 --> 0:1:30,96
JOHN ODA: Do you guys
feel different?


32
0:1:30,96 --> 0:1:34,21
I mean, it does something
to your awareness.


33
0:1:34,21 --> 0:1:37,6
You feel up but relaxed
and almost a


34
0:1:37,6 --> 0:1:38,11
little euphoric sometimes.


35
0:1:38,11 --> 0:1:39,36
JASON MCAFEE: Mm-hm.


36
0:1:39,36 --> 0:3:39,36
