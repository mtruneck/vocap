Greetings Food Tubers, I'm Aaron Craze and
I'm back! I've got something in store for


2
0:0:9,8 --> 0:0:14,45
you today. Stuffed Steak rolls.
A nice bit of steak filled with couscous.


3
0:0:14,45 --> 0:0:20,999
We have a nice bit of skirt. So I'm going
to just literally cut a little butterfly,


4
0:0:20,999 --> 0:0:25,269
I don't want to go all the way through, just
enough so it opens out up like that.


5
0:0:25,269 --> 0:0:30,55
We want to bash it out, okay to make it flat
enough to roll it.


6
0:0:30,55 --> 0:0:35,17
Nearly there. Looking good, looking fresh
to me.


7
0:0:35,17 --> 0:0:39,719
What was that you say? No bread, bread is
dead. You don't need no bread for this one.


8
0:0:39,719 --> 0:0:44,51
It's all about the filling.
Trust me, this will be the best couscous you


9
0:0:44,51 --> 0:0:48,269
will ever make.
Here we go, I've got some lovely couscous


10
0:0:48,269 --> 0:0:53,329
here. Right, about 100 grams there. You know
when it's ready when it just flakes like that.


11
0:0:53,329 --> 0:0:58,19
We've got our dried apricots, chopped up.
Now they bring a really nice sweetness to


12
0:0:58,19 --> 0:1:2,679
it. A little bit of a bite. And we've got
some onions that Have just been caramelised


13
0:1:2,679 --> 0:1:8,35
with some caraway seed and some cumin.
Peppers, when you're making this, try and


14
0:1:8,35 --> 0:1:12,96
chop everything the same sort of size.
That way you get a little bit of everything


15
0:1:12,96 --> 0:1:18,93
when you take a bite. Grated beetroot. Gives
it a nice acidity, a nice crunch. Olives,


16
0:1:18,93 --> 0:1:25,35
chop them up. Beautiful.
Already, it's like a rainbow of love. Toasted,


17
0:1:25,35 --> 0:1:28,29
whole almonds. You can use flake. I'm just
going to crush them up a little bit.


18
0:1:28,29 --> 0:1:34,78
Coriander. Bit of basil, bit of tarragon there.
So let's chop these up.


19
0:1:34,78 --> 0:1:42,56
Are you licking your lips right now?
Bit of garlic. Background flavour. Bit of


20
0:1:42,56 --> 0:1:46,1
salt on there. We've got to make sure it's
minced up.


21
0:1:46,1 --> 0:1:51,39
Now halloumi.
Chilli. We're going to spice it up a bit.


22
0:1:51,39 --> 0:1:57,149
Take the seeds out.
I just go like that, over the bin.


23
0:1:57,149 --> 0:2:4,289
Nice little rings in there.
Bit of seasoning. Salt and pepper. The best


24
0:2:4,289 --> 0:2:9,399
food marriage in the world.
We're going to lift it up in the air with


25
0:2:9,399 --> 0:2:13,75
a bit of orange and lemon zest. A little bit
of oil. Let's get a bit Jamie Oliver about


26
0:2:13,75 --> 0:2:17,27
it,
He loves doing all of this doesn't he!


27
0:2:17,27 --> 0:2:22,25
It adds like a peppery, grassy, creamy sort
of taste to it. Right, that's done. Ready


28
0:2:22,25 --> 0:2:27,71
to go, it's got every texture, every flavour
going on in there you can imagine.


29
0:2:27,71 --> 0:2:32,66
We've got three layers of cling film down
there. Get our beef of here. You might have


30
0:2:32,66 --> 0:2:40,38
to coach it a little bit. There is a few little
bits that are broken. It's not a problem.


31
0:2:40,38 --> 0:2:46,3
Little bit of salt and pepper. Not too much
because remember we seasoned our filling over


32
0:2:46,3 --> 0:2:48,6
there.
I've got some creme fraiche you can use. Yoghurt.


33
0:2:48,6 --> 0:2:51,33
Let's put a little bit of that on. We're pasting
the wall.


34
0:2:51,33 --> 0:2:56,99
Right?
I'm going to put a little splash of horseradish


35
0:2:56,99 --> 0:3:0,53
in there.
Basil leaves these are going to be like wallpaper.


36
0:3:0,53 --> 0:3:3,16
With loads of flavour. It's going to fill
it up look!


37
0:3:3,16 --> 0:3:7,47
This is the way I think.
Wonderful, now we're ready for the filling.


38
0:3:7,47 --> 0:3:14,9
I'm going to grab a big old handful like that.
You can imagine being on the streets of Mexico


39
0:3:14,9 --> 0:3:18,11
city, or somewhere like that, you know what
I'm saying. Boom, they're putting this all


40
0:3:18,11 --> 0:3:22,73
out. The sun's shining.
Use the cling film to bring everything together.


41
0:3:22,73 --> 0:3:28,37
So I'm trying to get this as tight as possible,
yeah? And the other hand here. I'm sort of


42
0:3:28,37 --> 0:3:33,87
pulling and tucking, pulling, making sure
the cling films nice and straight. Tie a little


43
0:3:33,87 --> 0:3:39,39
knot in the side.
The idea is we want it to set. As a sausage


44
0:3:39,39 --> 0:3:43,19
In the fridge.
So, that is it. Er, ready to go into the fridge.


45
0:3:43,19 --> 0:3:49,33
Ready to chill for about half an hour, an
hour if you've got the time. See you in a


46
0:3:49,33 --> 0:3:52,68
bit.
Thirty minutes is up and this is ready to


47
0:3:52,68 --> 0:3:57,3
be grilled. So nice bit of oil on there.
Never put the oil in the pan because it will


48
0:3:57,3 --> 0:4:5,29
start smoking up. That's a noise that you're
looking for there. Back to the Building tray.


49
0:4:5,29 --> 0:4:8,84
We're going a bit of welding now.
Alright? So we're just sealing that crack


50
0:4:8,84 --> 0:4:17,699
down there right. Be patient. We want those
really nice dark brown grill marks. Come on,


51
0:4:17,699 --> 0:4:20,9
come on baby.
It's still a little bit pink in the middle.


52
0:4:20,9 --> 0:4:26,12
That's fine, that's the way I like it.
That's ready.


53
0:4:26,12 --> 0:4:29,9
Very important. Leave that to rest for about
5 to 7 minutes. There you go it's rested.


54
0:4:29,9 --> 0:4:43,37
Now you just need to wrap it up and eat it!
Oh my god look at this! I'm going to pout


55
0:4:43,37 --> 0:4:49,77
ti down for a minute and do this.
WOW. W O W. There's more of these out there.


56
0:4:49,77 --> 0:4:53,65
I've got a steak tortilla. It's up there now,
press it.


57
0:4:53,65 --> 0:5:1,24
Ohh mate! That beautiful couscous. Loads of
flavours going on.


58
0:5:1,24 --> 0:5:8,33
No bread, just meat.
