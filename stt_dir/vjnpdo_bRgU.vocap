###23 BRAZIER: Better nutrition is basically what the core [INDISTINCT] talks about, whether
###28 it's last night's performance or other types of performance. So it's kind of just a full
###35 gamut of what performance is. I'll be talking about how to prove that through what we eat.
###46 I'll give you a little background first. I started off in 1990. I started running track
###55 in high school and I just really enjoyed it. I just loved running, so I thought, "Well,
###64 if I have to do this full-time as a career, as a job, that would be ideal." So that's
###68 when I started working towards just trying to be a full-time professional runner just
###76 because enjoyed it. I'm just really--like it or not by nature a competitive person,
###84 you know, I just--just something I like to do. So, unfortunately, soon after, I got injured.
###94 I ran too much, did it too much too soon and I got stressed up. So, I started swimming,
###109 cycling trying to maintain my fitness while I was injured and I realized I really like
###116 swimming and cycling as well. So I kind of figured swimming, cycling, running, that's
###124 triathlon. Maybe I can do triathlon full-time and have that as my career and have that as
###133 my job and now this could be ideal, this could be perfect. And I might say, by nature, I'm
###142 not really a competitive person, so I wasn't doing this to try to prove anything to myself
###153 or anyone, I just like doing it. So, I'm not really a motivational type of speaker, so
###168 thought about overcoming odds and, like, breaking through barriers and trying to push myself
###175 to experience times like this, so I hope I don't disappoint anyone. But soon after, I
###182 decided to do Ironman Triathlon. Ironman Triathlon is made up of a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike
###193 ride and a marathon, so 26.2 miles. So, obviously, a really long event but if you want to do
###205 well, you have to train a lot. But like I said, I enjoyed the training so that was--that
###217 was the easy part for me just--because I like it. But what surprised me is when I started
###231 looking into this seriously and I found that some of the top athletes in the world were
###246 doing the identical training to the average athletes. Their training programs differed
###253 very little. And, of course, I asked myself, "Well, if some of these guys are top in the
###261 world and now they are just average, what is it that separates that?" Obviously, it's
###268 not the training, so there's another factor there that is allowing some to become world-class
###276 while others remain average in [INDISTINCT]. So, I started to investigate that and I found
###281 it had more to do with what happened between the training as opposed to the actual training
###284 itself. So, the recovery phase, the phase that your body generates and renews itself
###289 after exercise is what we realized is the most important phase. And, of course, when
###294 we rest, we eat well, our body overcompensates and becomes stronger, that's why training
###301 works, is that overcompensation by our body that I think only happened during the recovery
###310 phase and when our cell regenerate and renew themselves. So, that's where I began to focus,
###322 is on that renewal process. And I realized that around 80% of recovery could be attributed
###338 to nutrition, so, obviously, an overwhelming amount. So that's what I started focusing
###343 on, was nutrition. And that's why I value and trust the nutrition [INDISTINCT] age.
###349 And I didn't care about nutrition just so I could say nutrition. I cared about it because
###359 I knew it would stab the [INDISTINCT] as an athlete. And I've never really being entrusted
###367 with nutrition so much, but I'm entrusting the outcome of a good nutrition; the mental
###376 clarity, the ability to get away with less sleep, the ability to be more productive which,
###388 you know, I need to tell you people about, so things like that that are very tightly
###391 tied to good nutrition, what it can do for you. So I became quite interested in this.
###399 And I started trying different ways of eating just to see if I could boost my performance
###404 with these--these different types of diets. I tried the whole gamut; I tried the high
###411 carb, low carb, high protein, low protein and nothing really impressed me. And some
###419 were better than others, but nothing was really amazing and I found that I wasn't really getting
###431 the results I wanted. So, I kept on trying different ones and I tried to completely file
###439 these diets to a vegan--completely vegan diet and it didn't work. At first, I was always
###449 hungry, I was tired and I wasn't recovering well and my high school track coach asked
###458 me what I was doing wrong and I'm almost trying this--this new diet, this new way of eating.
###467 And he was a very good coach but because he was so good, he was somewhat closed-minded.
###479 He had had a lot of success, he had the template that worked, he put all of his athletes through
###493 it, they got results, so he wasn't willing to change and he had zero interest in this
###498 new way of eating. And that discouraged me at the time, but when I look back on that,
###507 I think that was actually a good thing because it's helped me realize that if this top level
###516 coach doesn't place any value to good nutrition, then probably a lot of other top level coaches
###530 doesn't either. So I thought, "Okay. Well, if I can find a recovery program that works
###539 well for myself maybe that's the sort of thing that then can be passed onto athletes through--through
###549 coaches. And he, like I say, was resistant to this but I kept on pursuing it and looking
###559 into ways to boost performance through better nutrition. I tried a whole bunch of different
###565 ways of eating. Like I say, there's different high carb, low protein also [INDISTINCT].
###573 And then the [INDISTINCT] I start investigating further. I thought, "I think there's something
###589 to this. I was eating wrong" and I was eating wrong. I was basically eating a junk food
###595 vegan diet and that's very easy to do. And keep in mind too when I--when I'm telling
###604 this story this was happening in 1990, so information didn't flow the way that it does
###607 today. So information about all this nutrition was very hard to come by, information about
###615 sports-specific kind of based nutrition is near impossible. So I had to do a lot of research
###623 and really find out what's--what would help me and I have--I--I revealed five major things
###628 initially that I was lacking in my diet, to this eating junk food diet, and it was complete
###637 protein, vitamin B12, iron, calcium and omega 3 fatty acids. So, pretty major stuff that
###645 I simply didn't have in my nutrition program. So as I investigated, I did some research
###653 more, I found what each of these nutrients came from, which plants. And then I found
###659 those plants, started planting them together kind of [INDISTINCT] working and it really
###663 did work. It did allow me to speed recovery. It didn't taste very good but it's functional.
###673 It got me what I wanted it. It got me to the point where I could--did considerably more
###682 training than people I trained with and that was a huge advantage because that enforced-obviously,
###689 my performance improved at a quicker rate and I got closer to achieving my goal of having
###696 that triathlon. So I was pleased with that. In 1990, I started all this, in '98 I started
###708 my professional career as an athlete, as an Ironman triathelete. So I did that seven years
###717 full-time and it was great. I really enjoyed that, that seven-year career. It went--it
###724 went well. But in 2004, I slipped [INDISTINCT] in cycling and I couldn't raise my gear, and
###733 obviously not a good thing to have happened but for the first time I thought, "I have
###743 trained all this time. I have always been training, racing and [INDISTINCT] for anything."
###750 So, this is kind of exciting to me and I've been getting asked the same question over
###757 and over. These people knew that I raced at a high level, they knew I had [INDISTINCT],
###767 so I always getting asked where do I get my calcium, my iron, protein, all these things.
###774 So, I decided to address those and write about them in a short book that I published that's
###783 called Thrive. Self-published book, 500 pages long and it came up in 2004. Then I expanded
###793 it, added a bunch of new ideas, expanded on the ideas that existed and added 500 recipes
###806 and that became called the Thrive Diet. It was published by Penguin in Canada and then
###814 published the following year here [INDISTINCT] diet. Apparently, the word "diet" sounds [INDISTINCT]
###821 here, so I don't know. So it's just--if you see a book called Thrive Diet, it is the same
###836 book [INDISTINCT]; different publisher, different cover, different title, same book. And anyway,
###842 so what I wanted to do today is kind of go over some of the main ideas in--in those books
###850 that you can use to apply to life whether you're athletic or not. They are very broad,
###856 so they will help you perform better, like I said, when you're an athlete or you just
###866 want to maximize you ability to think clearly, you can sleep amount by quality, [INDISTINCT],
###873 all those things. As I was mentioning, in 2004, I have partnered with someone else and
###881 we collaborated and made a replica the [INDISTINCT] myself for years and it's now available in
###890 all pretty much all healthy stores, it's called [INDISTINCT] appetizer. If you love samples,
###895 [INDISTINCT] and if you want to talk a little bit on that as I finish speaking here you're
###904 very welcome to. We made some of that [INDISTINCT]. So it was pronounced six years in Canada,
###920 five years here. Anyway, the first thing I want to talk about pertaining to the book
###928 is something called gaining energy through conservation as opposed to consumption. What
###936 do I mean by that? It's eating food, you use less energy, it's digested similarly but give
###946 you more new things in return. Now, I made a mistake for years and I think a lot of people
###956 make this mistake, it's very common, to assume that since calories [INDISTINCT] food energy,
###962 you would think that the more calories you ate the more energy you would have. It seems
###971 to make sense, but if that worked really true, people eat lots of fast food, lots of high
###985 calorie foods without [INDISTINCT]. So the problem is, is that you have to spend energy
###991 to digest when eating highly processed foods and when you spend something you no longer
###998 have it, just like anything. It's like money, if you spend it, it's gone, you don't have
###1004 it. However, you can make a good investment and get a return on that investment. So that's
###1008 something that you have to think about food, is something that I would get a return on
###1014 if I made the right choice. So, for example, I went from eating tons of grand peanut butter,
###1026 not that that's the worst thing in the world to eat but it is very highly processed, it
###1039 is [INDISTINCT] bread and processed peanut butter. So we spend a lot of energy to digest--disseminate
###1053 that food so you have lots of it. Pretty simple not like--plus, it has very few nutrients
###1064 in it and when I say nutrients that's speaking of micronutrients. You know, we don't lack
###1074 calories. Calories are very, very easy to get. It's the micronutrients that a lot of
###1086 us lack and micronutrients are vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, anti-oxidants, all those things
###1097 are the base to good health that by eating these way, I was getting the calories but
###1102 I wasn't getting the micronutrinets. So I switched over and started squatting out right
###1108 a bread and even regular bread and pasta and all types of flours, all types of refined
###1112 starchy foods. [INDISTINCT] started eating, most likely, carbohydrate and fruit. Fruit
###1117 is a great source of carbohydrate, it digest much more easily than these refined carbs
###1123 plus there's more micronutrients. So, less energy out, more micronutrients in, I call
###1128 that high net-gain food. So that's the first part that I [INDISTINCT] on my focus on the
###1135 basic diet on high net-gain foods. Now, in other high net-gain food, in addition to this
###1143 fruit, there's something called [INDISTINCT] amaranth, [INDISTINCT] wild rice, these are
###1151 typically seeds, they're not grains. So they're anti-coagulant, they digest more easily because
###1160 they are seeds, they have more protein, they're around 25% protein supposed to, with grain
###1167 it will be much low. So, just making that little change with my diet, I found--I had
###1169 significantly more energy, yet my calories dropped, 20% to 30% but more energy. It is
###1174 like, so, is it spending so much to get it? Plus, I started getting more micronutrients
###1179 in. Now when you get the micronutrients in, that's going to help turn off your hunger
###1186 signal. Now, our hunger signal of course, is a cardinal signal that goes back to our
###1201 previous ancestor that tells us we need food and we need food for fuel and building blocks.
###1215 So, as soon as we get hungry, that's a sign, a biological sign, it speaks in from our brain
###1226 and tells to eat. Now, the problem is, most of Americans, a lot of food they eat lacks
###1234 micronutrients. So, our hunger signal remains active, you see, white bread as an example.
###1240 White bread, pretty much no micronutrients but you could eat it, it would physically
###1246 fill up your stomach but you're still going to be hungry, you're still going to want eat--keep
###1251 eating because that chemical hunt--hunger signal remains active. Now that's the number
###1257 reason for obesity in North America. It's very simple, we'd over consume. But the reason
###1264 we over consume is because there's so few micronutrients in the food we have these days
###1272 that we keep on eating and until we get the micronutrients to satisfy our hunger signal
###1281 and turn it on. And of course that, that's a lot of food, and then that's a lot of calories,
###1290 that's why people gain weight. And of course we gain weight, your risk factor for a whole
###1297 bunch of diseases goes up. So, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases,
###1298 all these things. So, if we [INDISTINCT] foods plus all of--some specifics that have been
###1304 here, we're going to get full much more easily. We just don't want you to eat it. So, very
###1311 clearly, I'm not an advocate of portion control, I think if you're hungry, you should eat.
###1321 Food is not the enemy. Food is good. Food is a good thing for you. Why do we get ourselves
###1330 in trouble? It's because we eat--at times Americans, a lot of highly refined foods that
###1341 do not turn off our hunger signal and just creates a wealth of calories that basically
###1350 you're not healing. And it's actually very common, you have to be overfed, you have to
###1357 be nourished. I mean, I would have been a paradox, you know, 15, 20 years ago but I
###1366 was pretty much the norm and people who are obese are calling me, showing symptoms of
###1372 malnutrition. And you'll figure, how can you mean so much to become obese yet, be malnourished?
###1382 Very strange, but that's a testament to other direction our food system is going with producing,
###1394 yes, a lot of calories, a lot of starch, very low micronutrients. So, like I said, basically,
###1408 a diet on these high net-gain foods, a lot of energy out, lots of micronutrients in and
###1418 basically [INDISTINCT] a lot. There's something else I think is really important, is the relationship
###1424 between stress and hormones. Now, there are [INDISTINCT] a lot of people don't realize
###1432 this, I didn't realize this until I experience the downside of it and this is really a lot
###1439 of what my [INDISTINCT] me making states--taking years to figure them out and then, you know,
###1440 remembering the [INDISTINCT] so, hopefully, you don't have to be in the same states but
###1447 stress does not know where it comes from. It's perceived by your body the same way and
###1458 it has the same physiological response which is causing cortisol to get a lot of cortisol
###1466 stress hormones. So, stress can come from too much work, not enough downtime, you have
###1473 initial stress; concerns about family, concerns about relationship, concerns about professional
###1479 problems, walking down the street could be included there, that's environmental stress
###1485 or eating food that takes a lot of energy to digest because a very few nutrients returned
###1496 is nutritional stress. You know, work without getting something back is--it's biologically
###1503 stressful. It's [INDISTINCT] so, all those things even--it's like, logical stress. It's
###1510 like, we're going to go things you have control of it. Stress, you know, some people are more
###1526 [INDISTINCT] than other than [INDISTINCT] personality types [INDISTINCT] and, you know,
###1531 90% of those things they can't control. So, that's just extra stress that you don't need.
###1540 So, when that happens, anyone of those things triggers a stress response, cortisol will
###1548 go up, when cortisol goes up several bad things happen. One, physiologically you will not
###1554 be able to get to deep phase of sleep, on delta; that's a really deep rejuvenating phase
###1565 that as North Americans, most of us never get into it. And the reason of that of course
###1575 is cortisol being high. So, then we don't sleep deeply, we don't get this deep delta
###1587 phase of sleep, so what happens is, of course we wake up and we're still tired and then
###1596 when we do eventually get on that, we'll take coffee and sugar. Coffee and sugar works.
###1604 They give us energy right away and puts through stimulation and obviously it's treating the
###1613 symptom [INDISTINCT] it's altering the cause--the cause is we didn't sleep well. We didn't sleep
###1620 well is because the cortisol's high and the cortisol's high because of stress. So, it
###1629 all comes back to that. So if you do drink coffee, [INDISTINCT] to overcome this, it
###1638 just perpetuates the circle and then we become dependent on this stimulants and I realize
###1643 that we all can be successful in [INDISTINCT] not to break that cycle and it's hard to do,
###1653 you look around and see all the coffee shop and deli shops, it's very clear. The poor
###1663 society that is dependent on these stimulants but as we lower cortisol and I'll give you
###1675 specifics in a minute on how it is but cortisol starts [INDISTINCT] sleep deeply, you wake
###1685 up, you're freshly rested, you're ready to go, you don't have to take coffee and take
###1692 sugar. It [INDISTINCT] now the down side to this of course, is that it's [INDISTINCT]
###1695 it will take a couple of weeks to kick in, you drink coffee, obviously it's a medium,
###1705 this is not a medium. So, you have to be prepared putting in a little bit of an effort and invest
###1711 a little bit enough but of course, once it happens, then the problem is solved, you don't
###1718 have to deal with it anymore. And now there's a huge advantage to reducing cortisol is that,
###1722 when you sleep more deeply, when you get to that deep delta phase of sleep, you're colony
###1731 obviously is getting better. So therefore, naturally, you're quantity will come down.
###1739 So, maybe, you just need eight or nine hours sleep at night. Now, you can get away with
###1742 seven. And that's obviously very beneficial, I mean, anyone will sure benefit from that
###1744 extra hours of sleep at night or an extra hour of balance sleep a day. So it's kind
###1748 of a deal that saying everyday is [INDISTINCT] so, it's great. It's obviously a very practical
###1752 solution to freeing up more [INDISTINCT] by improving sleep quality and quantity to able
###1755 to [INDISTINCT] and I'm sure you've noticed this, you have pretty much had conversations
###1756 with people and you're wondering, are these people totally paying attention? Are they
###1758 fully awake? And the answer is probably no, they're not. Because when they're sleeping,
###1765 they probably weren't fully asleep. So I want it to become blur between being sleepy and
###1769 being awake. We don't sleep fully deeply; when we're awake, we're not fully awake in
###1769 some people, so. I'm honestly defining up on deep sleep and then complete being awake
###1771 and focus concentration and obviously productivity and stuff like that goes up. So, I'm sure
###1774 you don't appreciate that. Less sleep, another problem with high cortisol level is the inability
###1777 to tone muscle and move body fat efficiently. Now again, I learned this the hard way. I
###1780 was training in 1997, 35, 40 hours a week, I was trying to build up for my first [INDISTINCT]
###1783 even, first professional career as a triathlete for the following year and I was training
###1786 35 to 40 hours a week, it was great up until the fourth week and then I stared, first of
###1787 all, I started getting really tired and I thought, well, this [INDISTINCT] reason I'm
###1792 exercising a lot. But the more tired I got, the worst quality of sleep became. And I realize
###1794 now of course, that's because I've--has cortisol to go high, which should prevent me from sleeping
###1795 deeply so I can compensate by adding extra sleep and it [INDISTINCT] back in front but
###1796 I was sleeping nine hours a night and obviously, you don't have to do that and to make up for
###1802 the, you know, the shortcomings of my quality of sleep but also with the more quantity.
###1803 But like, as I got to back on track, I didn't understand it since I was [INDISTINCT] dressing
###1806 properly but now I know of course, if it had been to better nutrition that it would release
###1811 cortisone. What's starting to happen at the following year is even more strange, I began
###1811 gaining weight and it wasn't muscle, it was fat. I started gaining by pound of fat every
###1811 three weeks and I thought, "How is it possible to gain fat when I'm exercising 35, 40 hours
###1812 a week. No idea why. So I started asking around. I started asking, the so-called professionals,
###1813 reading a lot of books and everyone said the same thing. If you're gaining weight, it's
###1818 simple, you're taking more calories than you burn. And I thought, well, you know, that's
###1821 pretty strange because, yes, I was taking a lot calories but even if I was burning,
###1831 I thought, there's no way I would have taking in these excess fat. This can't be. But I
###1833 was out of idea. I had no idea what was going on. So I tried this suggestion, I cut back
###1835 in my food intake. I started gaining weight more for like--about a pound every two weeks
###1842 and I thought, "How is this possible?" If I'm right in eating, I'm gaining fat and I'm
###1847 exercising 35 to 40 hours a week, I don't get it. And I didn't get it until about a
###1851 year and a half later, until I spoke with men with problems to explain to me the relationship
###1851 between stress and hormones. Now, what I've done is I had over trained. So that's physical
###1853 stress, of course exercise is good but in excess, it's not and I stepped over the line.
###1855 So, I had put some physical strain in my body for me--having to find--recover from all these
###1856 exercise that--I've had some cortisol to be chronically elevated and burned up my adrenals.
###1857 So, I wasn't sleeping well, but also if cortisol goes high, it's near possible to tone muscle
###1857 and lose fat. In extreme cases, will be [INDISTINCT], so that's exactly what was happening to me
###1858 as I've gone to that extreme. And I think a lot of people are in that situation, not
###1861 from necessarily over training stress but just stress; work, family, all of those things
###1861 I mentioned before. So, it caused the cortisol to go up, so that means it's very difficult
###1862 to tone muscle and lose fat and breakthrough those athletic plateaus. So if you've been
###1863 working out consistently and you can't seem to get the results that you think you should,
###1864 look into at your life [INDISTINCT], look at all those other stresses and all those
###1866 other things going on as opposed to just calories in and calories out. The reason I started
###1866 gaining weight more quickly when I cut back on eating the food I was eating was because
###1866 I was down to five in my body nutrition. I wasn't getting the body--my body the fuel
###1866 it needed to fuel these workouts or the building blocks it needed to recover from it. So that
###1866 was just the greatest stress, I just placed more stress in my body which prompts the cortisol
###1866 to go up even higher which causes me to lean back that more quickly. So, on the surface
###1866 that seemed counter intuitive, obviously if you're exercising a lot, you're not eating
###1866 much and you're gaining weight, well, the tendency of course is exercise in the morning
###1866 less. That was the opposite if--of what I should have done. What I should have done
###1866 is ate more nutrient that's called high net-gain foods and alkaline-forming foods, I'll talk
###1867 about that in a minute and that's when it started to bring cortisol back down. So, I
###1868 think--like I said, a lot of people are in that situation and I'm sure you've seen people
###1870 like this. You see them at the gym, you go to the gym regularly. You see the same people
###1871 like week after week, maybe month after month, year after years. It's the same people at
###1873 your gym. And they have lose--that have lost 5 to 10 pounds or change their body shape,
###1875 whatever. And I'm sure if you were to go to those people and ask them what was going on,
###1877 then I must suggest you [INDISTINCT] right away if you were to do that. They'd probably
###1879 be confused, they probably wouldn't know what the problem is, but then we started looking
###1879 at--holistically as a person and not just the machine, calories in and calories out
###1880 but you started asking about their professional life, their personal life and you saw all
###1880 things that cause worry and concern in your, there's an answer; worry, concern, stress,
###1881 cortisol. So, essentially those people are and I was hormonally injured and that's the
###1882 way the endocrinologist explained me. And I think that's an excellent way to look at
###1882 it because--of course you can't see it, you know, like it's another type of injury; a
###1883 broken arm or something but it's still an injury. When your hormones are so far in the
###1883 [INDISTINCT] that you cannot tone muscle, you cannot lose fat. So, something to consider,
###1883 you know, if you're in that situation, you exercise diligently and you can't seem to
###1883 break through or you can go backwards then take a look at all the other things in your
###1883 life. Now, it's easier said than done in some cases. Now I understand that obviously there's
###1883 a lot of stresses in our life that we can't control and those things are family related,
###1884 work related, some of those things are out of our control. I will say one thing to that
###1884 though, perception also has a large component to do with the stress. If you could see something
###1884 stressful, it's stressful. So, as an example, I like to run, so for me to go for a run,
###1885 I actually get a greater physiological benefit, but some [INDISTINCT] forcing herself to go
###1892 for a run. So if you don't like running, don't run. It's pretty much that simple. People
###1893 say yoga is great for stress relief, yes, that's true if you like yoga, if you don't,
###1899 it's not so good. So, I think when you [INDISTINCT] your activity too, find something that you
###1900 really do enjoy and know that that is actually going to have a greater benefit to your end--your
###1901 end goal. >> [INDISTINCT]
###1901 >> BRAZIER: Now, I was--I was kind of flailing around with this, trying to fix this for awhile
###1903 and it wasn't until I piece those things together that it really made sense to me. So, what
###1904 I am going to say is, well, when I was researching the book, I found that of the average of North
###1905 America's total stress, 40% could be attributed to poor nutrition. Forty percent is huge.
###1906 Now, at first I thought it was terribly, you know, we're doing that to ourselves, we're
###1906 placing all types of stress on us by making poor or good choices. But then I realized
###1907 that was actually a good thing because we all control what we choose to eat and we make
###1907 those choices obviously. Like I say, we don't all control these other aspects that cause
###1907 stress but we control what we put in our mouths. So therefore, we have a lot of control over
###1907 lowering cortisol and bringing the cause of these symptoms which of course is overall
###1907 stress. So, the high net-gain foods, those will be the base, that's going to reduce a
###1907 large amount of cortisol, therefore a large amount of overall stress, therefore you're
###1907 going to free up a lot of these problems. I spoke a bit about acid alkaline and I think
###1908 that's where the--I'm going to talk a little more about. That's something that is better
###1908 understood now than it was a few years ago, but as North American's, we're actually getting
###1908 osteoporosis at a younger age that's never before in history. And originally that was
###1908 thought--the reason for that is that we weren't having enough calcium in our diet. It turns
###1908 out not to be the case. The reason we're getting osteoporosis at such a young age because we
###1908 take too much calcium out of our bodies and we do that by eating acid-forming foods, so
###1908 anything that is highly processed, white flour, white breads, synthetic vitamins, synthetic
###1908 drugs, meat, dairy, soda, all those are standard American diet, 100% acid-forming. So what
###1908 happens when you eat that? Is your body has to compensate, it has to off set this acid-forming
###1908 food that remains in your body. So what it does is it pulls calcium which is highly alkaline
###1908 out of the bones, into the blood to keep it neutral. Neutral pH is 7.35, so blood is going
###1908 to stay that way as a survival [INDISTINCT]. But in doing so, it draws calcium from the
###1908 bones. And you can add, you know, the course of one, two, or three that [INDISTINCT] every
###1908 meal, every snack is being acid-forming. You're going to get weaker bones and then eventually
###1908 osteoporosis. So that's why it's not uncommon now to see people get [INDISTINCT] who have
###1908 died and have osteoporosis in their 20s. So lastly, that saying, you obviously need alkaline-forming
###1908 foods. Alkaline-forming foods are basically any whole plant-based foods. They're going
###1908 to be much more alkaline-forming, the [INDISTINCT] feeling better they're going to be. The most
###1908 alkaline-forming foods are the... >> [INDISTINCT]
###1908 >> BRAZIER: ...green foods so anything with chlorophyll; spinach, [INDISTINCT], anything
###1908 like that, chlorella, spirulina which are both vegan as well, they're alkaline. Those
###1908 really help you to get alkaline. So, base salad everyday, the best thing to do for your
###1908 bones [INDISTINCT] great for your bones. But another huge advantage to keeping alkaline
###1908 is functionality. If you eat acid-forming food that all promotes inflammation and if
###1908 you have arthritis obviously that's, you know, that's a given, that's going to make a big
###1908 difference by just switching over. But even if you don't, just an average person, do you
###1908 think if--you have to work harder for every muscle contraction because they're inflamed,
###1908 you won't even know they're inflamed, that takes energy. So just walking across the room,
###1908 you don't have to spend energy obviously to do that and if you spend it, you have less
###1908 of it. So by the end of the day, you're going to be more tired which obviously again, you
###1908 know, it's just creating a more efficient body by reducing inflammation that is going
###1908 to free up your ability to move efficiently. Now, to an athlete, that becomes more important,
###1908 you know, if you think of all the muscle contractions during a 5K to 9K marathon, triathlon, there's
###1908 a lot. So, if you have to work hard for every month, you're going to needless to say spend
###1909 energy inefficiently. So, by eating these alkaline-forming foods, functionality improves
###1909 because it's [INDISTINCT]. Now, obviously I'm an endurance athlete, so it's all about
###1909 the strength to weight ratio, I want to be strong but I want to stay light and that's
###1909 a great way to do that. Obviously, getting this way, you know, keeps it pretty lean and
###1909 pretty light but what about if you want to grow a muscle? What if you're body building?
###1909 What is you're a power lifter and you want to put on some muscle? Can this type of eating
###1909 help? And yes, it can. Right after a workout, you're inflamed, your muscles are far down
###1909 from--and from the exercise and your body has to rebuild, so you need protein as building
###1909 blocks. But the problem is a lot of proteins, animal-based protein weight, protein--anything
###1909 from an animal is going to be more acid-forming. So if you eat alkaline-forming proteins, plant-based
###1909 proteins like [INDISTINCT] proteins, spirulina proteins, alfalfa, anything like that, rice
###1909 proteins, those things have chlorophyll in them, they're more alkaline-forming, they're
###1909 going to reduce inflammation right after workout. Now, when you reduce inflammation after your
###1909 workout--like I say, your functionality goes up. When your functionality goes up, you're
###1909 ability to life with heavier weight improves. So you'll be able to lift heavier weight next
###1909 time you're in the gym, which is--what makes it bigger and stronger, lifting heavier weight
###1909 is what build bigger and stronger muscle. So, eating this way in itself is not going
###1909 to make you stronger or bigger but it will allow you to train harder, you're just going
###1909 to get bigger and stronger. So, this kind of paves the road into that. Now, I'll talk
###1909 specifically to about some other ways to reduce overall stress. I talked about obviously perception
###1909 of different things, receiving and stress [INDISTINCT] and food. [INDISTINCT] the high
###1909 net-gain foods, the alkaline-forming foods, but there's something called maca as well.
###1909 It's spelled M-A-C-A, it's a root vegetable from Peru and it's grown at around 15,000
###1909 feet. And as with any plants, it's really a suppliant for the nutrient that are in the
###1909 soil. So it draws nutrition, vitamins and minerals--well minerals, draws them out and
###1909 it and extracts vitamins in its tissue by doing that and then it passes it onto the
###1909 animal or the person who eats it. So it's really a conduit for good quality soil. Now,
###1909 what makes maca eating is it has the ability to grow in this very difficult planet; so
###1909 very hot in the day, very cold at night, other plants can't grow at this altitude but maca
###1909 can. So it's monopolized all the nutrients from this volcanic soil and it will pass it
###1909 on to you which helps rebuild the [INDISTINCT] function. So, that was around seven or eight
###1909 years ago, I found out about maca and started adding it to my [INDISTINCT] grain and it
###1909 made a big difference. It took about six weeks to kick in but once it did, I noticed better
###1910 sleep quality right away and I noticed just--obviously then--so sleeping better, you have more energy
###1910 and then you have sugar cravings, starch cravings, all those things. So it kind of got things
###1910 back on track. So if you're eating those highly alkaline-forming foods and if you're eating
###1910 those high net-gain foods and you still find you have the symptoms of stress which are
###1910 general fatigue, [INDISTINCT] and apnea and sugar cravings, starch cravings especially
###1910 in the evening, dependence on stimulants such as coffee and sugar, difficulty toning muscle,
###1910 moving fat event though you exercise, all those things. Those are signs of high cortisol.
###1910 Those are signs that you're probably in a lot of stress in your life which is the most
###1910 high and that's in North America. Especially, you know, with high achievers where people
###1910 got a lot to do; if you've got a lot of things to work on, on projects, a lot of big stuff
###1910 to do. It's a--you know, it's the norm. So, that's normal. It's how you--how you off set
###1910 a lot with it, the nutrition that can make the difference. So, like I say, I eat about
###1910 two and a half grams of [INDISTINCT] a day, help me get through that. So, you may want
###1910 to consider that. It isn't [INDISTINCT] as well so if you are having [INDISTINCT] a day,
###1910 you won't get that anyways. And like I say, we'll have--we'll have some [INDISTINCT] to
###1910 try.
