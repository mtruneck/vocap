1
0:0:0,6 --> 0:0:3,419
all volunteers who told you about the
drone program in the killers that


2
0:0:3,419 --> 0:0:8,44
president obama has and how ridges that
is well we now have a memo that confirms


3
0:0:8,44 --> 0:0:11,15
exactly how bad we thought it was


4
0:0:11,15 --> 0:0:14,949
and of course uh... previous reports
came from weeks within the white house


5
0:0:14,949 --> 0:0:16,57
that's what we believe that they were


6
0:0:16,57 --> 0:0:20,9
true in terms of reporting it 'cause it
was the white house bragging about it


7
0:0:20,9 --> 0:0:20,71
all now


8
0:0:20,71 --> 0:0:24,7
michael's a couple of n_b_c_ news has
the white papers a sixteen page memo


9
0:0:24,7 --> 0:0:28,56
that justifies killing u_s_ citizens
would throw strikes


10
0:0:28,56 --> 0:0:30,189
so


11
0:0:30,189 --> 0:0:31,419
is it as they


12
0:0:31,419 --> 0:0:36,56
is short of something that they knew all
in the most dire circumstances and


13
0:0:36,56 --> 0:0:41,91
somebody's about the launch against the
united act out a few why dot we have to


14
0:0:41,91 --> 0:0:44,239
take out the sitting quietly important


15
0:0:44,239 --> 0:0:45,6
are clearly


16
0:0:45,6 --> 0:0:50,21
as you read the memo to becomes obvious
that of course that's not what happened


17
0:0:50,21 --> 0:0:52,22
so let me begin quoting it too


18
0:0:52,22 --> 0:0:54,97
the threat posed by allocated a explain


19
0:0:54,97 --> 0:1:0,9
and its associated forces demands a
broader concept of p


20
0:1:0,9 --> 0:1:4,67
imminence in judging what a person
continually planning terror attacks


21
0:1:4,67 --> 0:1:8,3
presents


22
0:1:8,3 --> 0:1:10,87
i love lawyerly language he had a sale
that means


23
0:1:10,87 --> 0:1:12,47
i'm is an eminent thread


24
0:1:12,47 --> 0:1:14,68
does it mean an imminent threat


25
0:1:14,68 --> 0:1:16,93
it doesn't have to be immediate


26
0:1:16,93 --> 0:1:18,33
except threat


27
0:1:18,33 --> 0:1:20,33
whenever


28
0:1:20,33 --> 0:1:23,37
as long as somebody in the executive
branch is decided


29
0:1:23,37 --> 0:1:26,91
yelling all like that guy he might be
someone at some point


30
0:1:26,91 --> 0:1:28,42
big is asap


31
0:1:28,42 --> 0:1:31,94
now here are the so-called limitations


32
0:1:31,94 --> 0:1:33,79
it does not require the u_s_


33
0:1:33,79 --> 0:1:37,36
to have information about a specific
imminent but i guess the u_s_


34
0:1:37,36 --> 0:1:41,14
uh... that those of a limitation this
seems like the exact opposite


35
0:1:41,14 --> 0:1:44,21
simple go-ahead bombs away number two


36
0:1:44,21 --> 0:1:47,38
it requires that they can to return a
suspect


37
0:1:47,38 --> 0:1:48,83
not be feasible


38
0:1:48,83 --> 0:1:50,79
but as a memo explains later


39
0:1:50,79 --> 0:1:54,64
or be in undue burden on our troops


40
0:1:54,64 --> 0:1:58,52
well he now would have been impaired and
trying to capture that guy


41
0:1:58,52 --> 0:2:1,34
or perhaps at post country didn't agree


42
0:2:1,34 --> 0:2:5,479
so we excuse somebody within the host
country because it was an undue burden


43
0:2:5,479 --> 0:2:6,27
okay


44
0:2:6,27 --> 0:2:7,43
and number three


45
0:2:7,43 --> 0:2:11,579
operation complies with the fundamental
law of war principles


46
0:2:11,579 --> 0:2:12,879
and that's where it's


47
0:2:12,879 --> 0:2:15,66
as a whole memo violates the law war
principles


48
0:2:15,66 --> 0:2:17,999
but it says at the end worried


49
0:2:17,999 --> 0:2:20,42
were following the law war principles
why


50
0:2:20,42 --> 0:2:22,369
because we said so


51
0:2:22,369 --> 0:2:24,699
now new laws of war allow you to


52
0:2:24,699 --> 0:2:25,93
excuse someone


53
0:2:25,93 --> 0:2:27,96
who is not an imminent threat


54
0:2:27,96 --> 0:2:33,249
and not on the battlefield and not the
jury came in many ways


55
0:2:33,249 --> 0:2:34,349
now


56
0:2:34,349 --> 0:2:35,369
they don't


57
0:2:35,369 --> 0:2:39,359
but we just said they did so trust us
where the government


58
0:2:39,359 --> 0:2:41,19
mhm i don't think so


59
0:2:41,19 --> 0:2:42,469
so uh... that


60
0:2:42,469 --> 0:2:46,219
that leads to while who's in making this
decision while don't worry we've got


61
0:2:46,219 --> 0:2:47,93
more information on that


62
0:2:47,93 --> 0:2:51,39
is a cough explained several different
quotes put together her from the white


63
0:2:51,39 --> 0:2:52,229
paper


64
0:2:52,229 --> 0:2:53,699
and informed


65
0:2:53,699 --> 0:2:57,95
high-level officials their forbidden of
course the was right


66
0:2:57,95 --> 0:3:0,879
and for my little official of the u_s_
government


67
0:3:0,879 --> 0:3:3,679
may determine did the targeted american
has been


68
0:3:3,679 --> 0:3:7,219
recently involved in activities


69
0:3:7,219 --> 0:3:9,389
posing a threat of violence that


70
0:3:9,389 --> 0:3:14,559
and there is no evidence suggesting that
he has renounced or abandoned such


71
0:3:14,559 --> 0:3:16,759
activities


72
0:3:16,759 --> 0:3:20,99
so women high-level official within the
imperial government


73
0:3:20,99 --> 0:3:21,919
who has decided that you


74
0:3:21,919 --> 0:3:24,699
have some activities at some point


75
0:3:24,699 --> 0:3:27,149
well the reason is not defined


76
0:3:27,149 --> 0:3:29,869
that uh... is a cause of concern for us


77
0:3:29,869 --> 0:3:32,27
and as far as we know


78
0:3:32,27 --> 0:3:36,499
you're not rebels those things that we
found somewhat suspicious


79
0:3:36,499 --> 0:3:39,339
this doesn't involve you get interested
in we finding out


80
0:3:39,339 --> 0:3:41,829
hey you know what what were those
activities and what were you planning


81
0:3:41,829 --> 0:3:45,459
certainly this involves your execution


82
0:3:45,459 --> 0:3:48,759
now remember during the bush years they
used to have a euphemism for torture was


83
0:3:48,759 --> 0:3:50,28
enhanced interrogation


84
0:3:50,28 --> 0:3:53,479
we fought a long battle to make sure it
was called a was torture


85
0:3:53,479 --> 0:3:54,719
now


86
0:3:54,719 --> 0:3:58,249
these are not executions there targeted
killings


87
0:3:58,249 --> 0:4:1,79
all r_t_c_


88
0:4:1,79 --> 0:4:2,89
no here's what they are


89
0:4:2,89 --> 0:4:4,31
assassinations


90
0:4:4,31 --> 0:4:5,84
and executions


91
0:4:5,84 --> 0:4:8,81
these are you would have said is is
remembered for u_s_ citizens


92
0:4:8,81 --> 0:4:10,639
have already been assassinated


93
0:4:10,639 --> 0:4:13,539
including as sixteen-year-old


94
0:4:13,539 --> 0:4:17,889
that was the branches are all walked
these slander


95
0:4:17,889 --> 0:4:19,709
and one robert gibbs was asked about it


96
0:4:19,709 --> 0:4:23,1
former white house spokesperson he said
well then they should know who they're


97
0:4:23,1 --> 0:4:25,319
associating with


98
0:4:25,319 --> 0:4:28,889
but he was an associating with an that
was is that it wasn't even in the same


99
0:4:28,889 --> 0:4:29,999
strike


100
0:4:29,999 --> 0:4:33,469
it was in a different strike


101
0:4:33,469 --> 0:4:37,169
but trust the government don't worrying
what we execute


102
0:4:37,169 --> 0:4:39,19
sixteen year old u_s_ citizens


103
0:4:39,19 --> 0:4:41,3
i'm sure we had a good reason


104
0:4:41,3 --> 0:4:43,44
that since there was another threat well


105
0:4:43,44 --> 0:4:46,59
your physician any information about the
strike


106
0:4:46,59 --> 0:4:49,29
well we continue here with this of


107
0:4:49,29 --> 0:4:53,229
orwellian words a decision maker
determining


108
0:4:53,229 --> 0:4:56,44
whether al qaeda operational leader
presents an imminent threat a violent


109
0:4:56,44 --> 0:5:0,5
act against the united states must take
into account that certain numbers of al


110
0:5:0,5 --> 0:5:5,159
qaeda are continually plotting attacks
against the united states


111
0:5:5,159 --> 0:5:8,139
units and i want


112
0:5:8,139 --> 0:5:11,71
we don't have to have information that
they attack is imminent or immediate or


113
0:5:11,71 --> 0:5:12,91
any such thing


114
0:5:12,91 --> 0:5:15,409
ever understand it had been al-qaeda


115
0:5:15,409 --> 0:5:17,1
they're constantly planning


116
0:5:17,1 --> 0:5:19,34
so we can tell them that anytime


117
0:5:19,34 --> 0:5:21,22
because we have seen they were


118
0:5:21,22 --> 0:5:24,139
they are in mid-atlantic


119
0:5:24,139 --> 0:5:27,819
how've much broader can this possibly be


120
0:5:27,819 --> 0:5:29,85
if you allow the president to do this


121
0:5:29,85 --> 0:5:32,279
what won't you allowed to do


122
0:5:32,279 --> 0:5:35,259
these are u_s_ citizens there excuse me


123
0:5:35,259 --> 0:5:37,79
al-qaeda would engage in such a tax
relief


124
0:5:37,79 --> 0:5:40,34
to accept that they were able to do so


125
0:5:40,34 --> 0:5:42,249
this is from amma


126
0:5:42,249 --> 0:5:44,39
in other words


127
0:5:44,39 --> 0:5:45,199
well


128
0:5:45,199 --> 0:5:47,9
what it might not have particular
evidence in this case


129
0:5:47,9 --> 0:5:53,2
but trust us iftikhar they work be
attacking us that's what we come up with


130
0:5:53,2 --> 0:5:55,679
a chance to


131
0:5:55,679 --> 0:5:56,879
well that's great


132
0:5:56,879 --> 0:5:59,33
so we're actually u_s_ citizens abroad


133
0:5:59,33 --> 0:6:1,99
based on three crops


134
0:6:1,99 --> 0:6:4,889
but trust the government we've got a
good man in charge oquawka hunter got


135
0:6:4,889 --> 0:6:7,83
maggie he would make a mistake worried


136
0:6:7,83 --> 0:6:9,569
he won be malicious about this


137
0:6:9,569 --> 0:6:14,9
that's what we trust the cake that's
what he has arctic ordained by god


138
0:6:14,9 --> 0:6:16,7
all-white he's supposed to be a
president


139
0:6:16,7 --> 0:6:20,77
now we're supposed to be a democracy we
settle messed up back in a magna carta


140
0:6:20,77 --> 0:6:21,879
they're setting us back


141
0:6:21,879 --> 0:6:24,11
aids under two years bush did it


142
0:6:24,11 --> 0:6:25,58
all but i was going at once


143
0:6:25,58 --> 0:6:28,44
was never executed u_s_ citizens like
this


144
0:6:28,44 --> 0:6:32,24
dick cheney thought now that's a bridge
to fall


145
0:6:32,24 --> 0:6:33,95
and now a part of the way


146
0:6:33,95 --> 0:6:34,9
yes bush


147
0:6:34,9 --> 0:6:39,439
stardust femina strode yes he said the
entire planet as a battlefield which is


148
0:6:39,439 --> 0:6:43,559
outrageous which means a tissue people
on-site basically because all i have an


149
0:6:43,559 --> 0:6:47,37
imminent danger everything's a
battlefield obama took at at what a step


150
0:6:47,37 --> 0:6:48,719
further


151
0:6:48,719 --> 0:6:50,449
the memo continues


152
0:6:50,449 --> 0:6:54,36
the u_s_ government may not be aware of
al qaeda plots as they're developing and


153
0:6:54,36 --> 0:6:55,72
those cannot be cabinet


154
0:6:55,72 --> 0:6:58,36
that none is about the car


155
0:6:58,36 --> 0:7:1,999
all for christ sake when you thought it
could be anywhere


156
0:7:1,999 --> 0:7:5,339
we're not confident that a plot is not
happening


157
0:7:5,339 --> 0:7:8,7
so we decided to executed u_s_ citizen


158
0:7:8,7 --> 0:7:14,2
artist verdict might be happening


159
0:7:14,2 --> 0:7:15,77
all the political will


160
0:7:15,77 --> 0:7:18,659
and yet it continues


161
0:7:18,659 --> 0:7:22,11
a lawful killing in self defense the
memo explains


162
0:7:22,11 --> 0:7:24,559
is not an assassination


163
0:7:24,559 --> 0:7:26,969
are well when you put it that way


164
0:7:26,969 --> 0:7:30,5
i didn't know your acting in
self-defense just in case the guy was


165
0:7:30,5 --> 0:7:32,18
going to do something else that's


166
0:7:32,18 --> 0:7:34,18
but we're not really sure about


167
0:7:34,18 --> 0:7:36,74
but yet security before he had a chance
to do it


168
0:7:36,74 --> 0:7:39,229
well then that would make a lawful
killing right because the courts to


169
0:7:39,229 --> 0:7:41,149
decide


170
0:7:41,149 --> 0:7:42,849
no judicial review


171
0:7:42,849 --> 0:7:45,24
ne for america's excuse so far


172
0:7:45,24 --> 0:7:50,3
had a trial or you've been any due
process in terms of the judiciary we


173
0:7:50,3 --> 0:7:52,369
never went to the judiciary


174
0:7:52,369 --> 0:7:55,519
it would just that budget reducing the
executive department deciding that you


175
0:7:55,519 --> 0:7:56,379
know what


176
0:7:56,379 --> 0:8:0,659
we'll talk to you that seems like due
process the guys i hired to work for me


177
0:8:0,659 --> 0:8:3,42
as lawyers have agreed that i can tell
that guy


178
0:8:3,42 --> 0:8:7,13
well are you not possible you check with
the guys you hire whose project depends


179
0:8:7,13 --> 0:8:9,15
on and and bring with you


180
0:8:9,15 --> 0:8:10,419
and of course are


181
0:8:10,419 --> 0:8:12,479
beloved attorney general eric holder


182
0:8:12,479 --> 0:8:13,8
summarize all this


183
0:8:13,8 --> 0:8:16,469
earlier in a speech that he made last
year


184
0:8:16,469 --> 0:8:17,649
depressants


185
0:8:17,649 --> 0:8:22,979
ten judicial process for another one in
the same particularly when it comes to


186
0:8:22,979 --> 0:8:27,859
national security the constitution
guarantees due process


187
0:8:27,859 --> 0:8:31,309
he does not guarantee judicial process


188
0:8:31,309 --> 0:8:34,85
stephen colbert joke crown about of said
well


189
0:8:34,85 --> 0:8:36,38
it could be a process of


190
0:8:36,38 --> 0:8:37,849
brock reverses


191
0:8:37,849 --> 0:8:39,51
could be a trial by fire


192
0:8:39,51 --> 0:8:42,589
ways that you will recall our this is
not process


193
0:8:42,589 --> 0:8:46,75
the new processes for a while back
together on this edition retail acti


194
0:8:46,75 --> 0:8:47,99
got bad luck


195
0:8:47,99 --> 0:10:47,99
after due process
