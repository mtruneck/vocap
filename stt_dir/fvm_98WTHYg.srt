1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,25



2
0:0:1,25 --> 0:0:18,504



3
0:0:18,504 --> 0:0:21,53
MITT ROMNEY: My dad had been
born in Mexico and his family


4
0:0:21,53 --> 0:0:23,785
had to leave during the
Mexican Revolution.


5
0:0:23,785 --> 0:0:25,9
He had big dreams.


6
0:0:25,9 --> 0:0:28,99
We were Mormons and growing up
in Michigan, that might have


7
0:0:28,99 --> 0:0:31,72
seemed unusual or out of place,
but I really don't


8
0:0:31,72 --> 0:0:33,23
remember it that way.


9
0:0:33,23 --> 0:0:35,91
My friends cared more about what
sports teams we followed


10
0:0:35,91 --> 0:0:37,34
than what church we went to.


11
0:0:37,34 --> 0:0:42,1



12
0:0:42,1 --> 0:0:44,7
SHANE SMITH: So we're on our
way down here to Colonial


13
0:0:44,7 --> 0:0:47,83
Juarez, which is in Northern
Mexico in Chihuahua state.


14
0:0:47,83 --> 0:0:51,45
A lot of people may know that
Romney and his family are


15
0:0:51,45 --> 0:0:52,5
actually from here.


16
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:55,52
His father was actually born
here in a Mormon colony.


17
0:0:55,52 --> 0:0:57,94
But maybe what they don't know
is that these Mormon colonies


18
0:0:57,94 --> 0:0:59,21
are still here.


19
0:0:59,21 --> 0:1:2,19
And they're actually fighting
the narco cartels, the drug


20
0:1:2,19 --> 0:1:4,31
cartels, that run this
whole region.


21
0:1:4,31 --> 0:1:5,64
They're standing up and
they're fighting the


22
0:1:5,64 --> 0:1:8,6
kidnapping and the violence
and the crime.


23
0:1:8,6 --> 0:1:11,28
So the question is, what are
the Mormons doing down in


24
0:1:11,28 --> 0:1:15,0
Mexico in the first place?


25
0:1:15,0 --> 0:1:19,3
Mormons originally came down
to Mexico in the late 1800s


26
0:1:19,3 --> 0:1:21,95
after the American government
forced the Mormon church to


27
0:1:21,95 --> 0:1:23,5
ban polygamy.


28
0:1:23,5 --> 0:1:26,31
The problem with this is that
Joseph Smith, the prophet of


29
0:1:26,31 --> 0:1:29,44
the religion, held that polygamy
was actually a divine


30
0:1:29,44 --> 0:1:30,16
commandment.


31
0:1:30,16 --> 0:1:33,1
He believed that you could only
reach the highest level


32
0:1:33,1 --> 0:1:36,23
of the celestial kingdom, or
heaven, if you are actually a


33
0:1:36,23 --> 0:1:38,1
partner in a plural marriage.


34
0:1:38,1 --> 0:1:40,36
So basically, the more wives
you had, the better


35
0:1:40,36 --> 0:1:41,48
heaven would be.


36
0:1:41,48 --> 0:1:44,21
And rather than give up their
place in heaven, many moved


37
0:1:44,21 --> 0:1:47,94
down to Mexico to continue to
practice polygamy, and thereby


38
0:1:47,94 --> 0:1:50,32
assure their place
in the afterlife.


39
0:1:50,32 --> 0:1:53,22
Here in the seclusion of the
Mexican desert, they could


40
0:1:53,22 --> 0:1:56,42
practice all the standard Mormon
rituals, like baptizing


41
0:1:56,42 --> 0:1:59,46
the dead or wearing magic
underwear, but also the more


42
0:1:59,46 --> 0:2:1,16
controversial plural marriage.


43
0:2:1,16 --> 0:2:4,38
Or, as we were soon to find
out, the outright insane


44
0:2:4,38 --> 0:2:6,86
practice of blood atonement.


45
0:2:6,86 --> 0:2:10,18
So after about five hours of
some very nervous driving and


46
0:2:10,18 --> 0:2:13,25
a couple of very thorough stops
at military checkpoints,


47
0:2:13,25 --> 0:2:15,72
not to mention two stops at
drive-through liquor stores to


48
0:2:15,72 --> 0:2:19,38
calm our very jangly nerves,
we finally arrived at the


49
0:2:19,38 --> 0:2:20,63
Mormon promised land.


50
0:2:20,63 --> 0:2:26,49



51
0:2:26,49 --> 0:2:29,11
We left Juarez, which
is very dirty and


52
0:2:29,11 --> 0:2:31,14
poor and very druggie.


53
0:2:31,14 --> 0:2:33,63
And then all of a sudden you
come over this hill, and


54
0:2:33,63 --> 0:2:35,61
there's orchards and
golf courses.


55
0:2:35,61 --> 0:2:37,82
The streets are laid out nice,
they've got nice schools, kids


56
0:2:37,82 --> 0:2:39,64
are playing baseball,
and there's angels.


57
0:2:39,64 --> 0:2:43,38
And it's kind of like ah, we've
come to God's country.


58
0:2:43,38 --> 0:2:46,35
Because it's beautiful here and
they obviously have money.


59
0:2:46,35 --> 0:2:48,52
So this is why they're being
targeted by the narcos, and


60
0:2:48,52 --> 0:2:49,89
this is why they have
to fight back.


61
0:2:49,89 --> 0:2:52,8
So now we're going to go meet
some Mormons who are actually


62
0:2:52,8 --> 0:2:53,33
fighting the narco cartel.


63
0:2:53,33 --> 0:2:59,18



64
0:2:59,18 --> 0:3:1,4
This is Brent LeBaron's farm.


65
0:3:1,4 --> 0:3:4,95
They are sort of famously
secretive about their weapons,


66
0:3:4,95 --> 0:3:6,97
their fighting, because they
don't want to be targeted


67
0:3:6,97 --> 0:3:8,34
anymore by the cartels.


68
0:3:8,34 --> 0:3:10,44
We're going to go meet him and
see if he'll show us around.


69
0:3:10,44 --> 0:3:13,5



70
0:3:13,5 --> 0:3:13,385
Brent?


71
0:3:13,385 --> 0:3:14,48
BRENT LEBARON: Yeah,
how's it going?


72
0:3:14,48 --> 0:3:15,335
SHANE SMITH: Shane Smith.


73
0:3:15,335 --> 0:3:16,7
BRENT LEBARON: Brent LeBaron.


74
0:3:16,7 --> 0:3:16,59
Nice to meet you.


75
0:3:16,59 --> 0:3:17,92
SHANE SMITH: Nice to meet
you, how you doing?


76
0:3:17,92 --> 0:3:18,475
BRENT LEBARON: I'm
very, very well.


77
0:3:18,475 --> 0:3:19,85
SHANE SMITH: This
is your farm?


78
0:3:19,85 --> 0:3:20,81
BRENT LEBARON: This
is my farm.


79
0:3:20,81 --> 0:3:24,32
We farm chili and a little bit
of wheat-- all depends on the


80
0:3:24,32 --> 0:3:25,49
time of the season.


81
0:3:25,49 --> 0:3:28,22
SHANE SMITH: We've heard that
the LeBaron family, the


82
0:3:28,22 --> 0:3:31,48
LeBaron colony, has sort of been
standing up to some of


83
0:3:31,48 --> 0:3:32,415
the narco cartels.


84
0:3:32,415 --> 0:3:36,81
BRENT LEBARON: Yeah, we've had
a few run-ins with them.


85
0:3:36,81 --> 0:3:39,52
I don't like to say too
much about them.


86
0:3:39,52 --> 0:3:41,86
But I'd love to show
you around.


87
0:3:41,86 --> 0:3:42,44
Let's go.


88
0:3:42,44 --> 0:3:43,47
SHANE SMITH: Let's do it.


89
0:3:43,47 --> 0:3:45,88
Now, I didn't know what to
expect when I first met Brent.


90
0:3:45,88 --> 0:3:47,33
And when I did, he
seemed to me more


91
0:3:47,33 --> 0:3:48,81
American than most Americans.


92
0:3:48,81 --> 0:3:50,8
In fact, I wouldn't have been
surprised if he told me he


93
0:3:50,8 --> 0:3:52,99
played linebacker for Alabama.


94
0:3:52,99 --> 0:3:55,67
But when he started to give me
the tour around the cemetery,


95
0:3:55,67 --> 0:3:58,64
I realized that his story
was anything but normal.


96
0:3:58,64 --> 0:4:1,38
BRENT LEBARON: This is a
graveyard where my grandfather


97
0:4:1,38 --> 0:4:4,816
and great grandfather
are buried.


98
0:4:4,816 --> 0:4:7,92
The original story is they come
down for the cause of


99
0:4:7,92 --> 0:4:10,12
plural marriage to
continue it--


100
0:4:10,12 --> 0:4:10,71
Mexico allowed it.


101
0:4:10,71 --> 0:4:12,97
SHANE SMITH: So they wanted
to continue polygamy?


102
0:4:12,97 --> 0:4:13,92
BRENT LEBARON: Yes.


103
0:4:13,92 --> 0:4:16,87
My great grandfather, being a
fundamentalist, he broke away


104
0:4:16,87 --> 0:4:19,459
from the Mormon church because
he had two wives.


105
0:4:19,459 --> 0:4:21,92
That's when he went to establish
Colonial LeBaron.


106
0:4:21,92 --> 0:4:25,33
They established five or
six colonies down here.


107
0:4:25,33 --> 0:4:26,42
SHANE SMITH: The colony would
be like a family?


108
0:4:26,42 --> 0:4:28,315
BRENT LEBARON: A few families.


109
0:4:28,315 --> 0:4:31,12
SHANE SMITH: And then your
grandfather had 10 wives.


110
0:4:31,12 --> 0:4:31,89
BRENT LEBARON: Yes.


111
0:4:31,89 --> 0:4:33,98
Had children by eight
of those 10.


112
0:4:33,98 --> 0:4:35,62
SHANE SMITH: And how many
grand kids did he have?


113
0:4:35,62 --> 0:4:37,72
BRENT LEBARON: Between grandkids
and great grandkids,


114
0:4:37,72 --> 0:4:40,21
they're probably pushing
the 400 mark right now.


115
0:4:40,21 --> 0:4:40,84
SHANE SMITH: Wow.


116
0:4:40,84 --> 0:4:41,68
All named LeBaron.


117
0:4:41,68 --> 0:4:42,67
BRENT LEBARON: All
named LeBaron.


118
0:4:42,67 --> 0:4:45,88
SHANE SMITH: Now, having more
than 400 grandchildren might


119
0:4:45,88 --> 0:4:49,38
seem extreme to some, but it's
nothing compared to the shit


120
0:4:49,38 --> 0:4:51,47
that Brent's Uncle
Ervil got up to.


121
0:4:51,47 --> 0:4:56,11
He was a straight up
fucking lunatic.


122
0:4:56,11 --> 0:5:0,34
Now Ervil not only had 13 wives
and over 50 children,


123
0:5:0,34 --> 0:5:2,95
but he also used his own family,
including his own


124
0:5:2,95 --> 0:5:5,455
kids, as assassins.


125
0:5:5,455 --> 0:5:8,62
Dubbed "The Mormon Manson,"
Ervil and his family were


126
0:5:8,62 --> 0:5:11,1
suspects in over 40 murders.


127
0:5:11,1 --> 0:5:14,21
Joel LeBaron was killed by his
own brother Ervil because of


128
0:5:14,21 --> 0:5:14,56
blood atonement?


129
0:5:14,56 --> 0:5:16,1
BRENT LEBARON: Yes.


130
0:5:16,1 --> 0:5:18,39
Well, Ervil tried to take over
the Church and he started


131
0:5:18,39 --> 0:5:21,6
claiming blood atonement,
the right to kill


132
0:5:21,6 --> 0:5:22,2
in the name of God.


133
0:5:22,2 --> 0:5:25,3
If you oppose him, he has
the right to kill you.


134
0:5:25,3 --> 0:5:28,18
Once Ervil snapped, he just
went on a killing spree.


135
0:5:28,18 --> 0:5:32,53
He had his daughters killed,
his wives killed, his sons


136
0:5:32,53 --> 0:5:34,44
killed and it just
went from there.


137
0:5:34,44 --> 0:5:35,8
He went haywire.


138
0:5:35,8 --> 0:5:38,42
SHANE SMITH: So Ervil goes on
this killing spree across


139
0:5:38,42 --> 0:5:40,38
Mexico and the United States.


140
0:5:40,38 --> 0:5:43,9
And at one point the Secret
Service is after him because


141
0:5:43,9 --> 0:5:45,49
he threatens to kill
President Carter.


142
0:5:45,49 --> 0:5:49,36
They finally captured Ervil in
1979 and sent him to prison,


143
0:5:49,36 --> 0:5:51,45
and all the killing
stops, right?


144
0:5:51,45 --> 0:5:52,16
Wrong.


145
0:5:52,16 --> 0:5:55,14
And then after he dies
in jail, people keep


146
0:5:55,14 --> 0:5:55,95
on killing for him.


147
0:5:55,95 --> 0:5:59,22
He killed up to 25 people after
he died because he left


148
0:5:59,22 --> 0:6:1,5
a sort of hit list, and they
just kept killing.


149
0:6:1,5 --> 0:6:2,51
BRENT LEBARON: They
kept killing.


150
0:6:2,51 --> 0:6:3,58
Yes, they did.


151
0:6:3,58 --> 0:6:5,35
SHANE SMITH: Now as Brent is
telling me all this, I had to


152
0:6:5,35 --> 0:6:8,5
keep in mind that this blood
atonement killing spree isn't


153
0:6:8,5 --> 0:6:11,27
taking place in the 1880s
or anything, this is all


154
0:6:11,27 --> 0:6:13,18
happening in the 1980s.


155
0:6:13,18 --> 0:6:15,3
BRENT LEBARON: My grandfather
ran from him


156
0:6:15,3 --> 0:6:16,5
for probably 10 years.


157
0:6:16,5 --> 0:6:16,98
SHANE SMITH: Wow.


158
0:6:16,98 --> 0:6:17,76
BRENT LEBARON: I mean,
he chased my


159
0:6:17,76 --> 0:6:19,6
grandpa clear to Nicaragua.


160
0:6:19,6 --> 0:6:22,18
SHANE SMITH: Your great uncle
was trying to kill your


161
0:6:22,18 --> 0:6:22,44
grandfather?


162
0:6:22,44 --> 0:6:23,37
BRENT LEBARON: Yeah.


163
0:6:23,37 --> 0:6:26,13
Verlan M. LeBaron died in a
car accident right out of


164
0:6:26,13 --> 0:6:27,7
Mexico City.


165
0:6:27,7 --> 0:6:30,47
A lot of people have been
skeptical that actually Ervil


166
0:6:30,47 --> 0:6:31,78
had something to do with it.


167
0:6:31,78 --> 0:6:36,2
And his last recorded words were
"Brother, it looks like


168
0:6:36,2 --> 0:6:38,18
you've been ran off the road."


169
0:6:38,18 --> 0:6:39,51
SHANE SMITH: That's
some crazy shit.


170
0:6:39,51 --> 0:6:40,76
BRENT LEBARON: Yeah.


171
0:6:40,76 --> 0:6:44,28
That's just a modern-day
Cain and Abel here.


172
0:6:44,28 --> 0:6:46,24
SHANE SMITH: Do you think that
that's one of the reasons why,


173
0:6:46,24 --> 0:6:49,35
because you had this sort of
familial civil war, you got


174
0:6:49,35 --> 0:6:50,6
tighter as a family?


175
0:6:50,6 --> 0:6:52,93
So when the narcos came
after your family you


176
0:6:52,93 --> 0:6:53,75
were sort of tougher?


177
0:6:53,75 --> 0:6:55,15
BRENT LEBARON: Well, definitely


178
0:6:55,15 --> 0:6:57,391
everyone was a watchman.


179
0:6:57,391 --> 0:6:59,78
SHANE SMITH: Now what he's
saying here is that because of


180
0:6:59,78 --> 0:7:3,18
Ervil, everyone in the LeBaron
clan watched out


181
0:7:3,18 --> 0:7:4,6
for everyone else.


182
0:7:4,6 --> 0:7:6,7
So when the cartels kidnapped
one of their


183
0:7:6,7 --> 0:7:8,53
own, they were ready.


184
0:7:8,53 --> 0:7:13,6
Eric LeBaron was only 16 when
he was abducted and held for


185
0:7:13,6 --> 0:7:15,13
$1 million ransom.


186
0:7:15,13 --> 0:7:16,46
And you didn't pay the ransom?


187
0:7:16,46 --> 0:7:17,69
BRENT LEBARON: We didn't
pay the ransom.


188
0:7:17,69 --> 0:7:19,9
SHANE SMITH: Even if you could
get the money and paid it,


189
0:7:19,9 --> 0:7:20,89
they're just going
to keep doing it.


190
0:7:20,89 --> 0:7:22,75
BRENT LEBARON: Just going to
keep coming and keep doing it.


191
0:7:22,75 --> 0:7:24,84
SHANE SMITH: They'll just use
the money to buy more guns and


192
0:7:24,84 --> 0:7:25,565
get more powerful.


193
0:7:25,565 --> 0:7:26,73
BRENT LEBARON: Exactly.


194
0:7:26,73 --> 0:7:29,84
If we don't sever the head off
this monster right now, it's


195
0:7:29,84 --> 0:7:31,1
just going to get worse.


196
0:7:31,1 --> 0:7:34,19
We had to go to the government
and say hey, you won't allow


197
0:7:34,19 --> 0:7:37,73
us to bear arms, but you're
supposed to protect us.


198
0:7:37,73 --> 0:7:40,13
SHANE SMITH: The protest forced
the government to put


199
0:7:40,13 --> 0:7:41,73
pressure on the kidnappers.


200
0:7:41,73 --> 0:7:44,67
And as is quite rare in these
situations, Eric was returned


201
0:7:44,67 --> 0:7:47,25
unharmed after paying
no ransom.


202
0:7:47,25 --> 0:7:51,7
However, it also served to
enrage the local drug lord


203
0:7:51,7 --> 0:7:54,43
named El Rikin, who only lived
eight miles down the road from


204
0:7:54,43 --> 0:7:55,93
Colonial LeBaron.


205
0:7:55,93 --> 0:7:59,2
Now, this is a narco who loves
drugs so much that he actually


206
0:7:59,2 --> 0:8:2,91
massacred 18 people trying to
get off the stuff at a drug


207
0:8:2,91 --> 0:8:4,15
rehab center.


208
0:8:4,15 --> 0:8:6,276
And now he's after
the LeBarons.


209
0:8:6,276 --> 0:8:13,91



210
0:8:13,91 --> 0:8:15,75
BRENT LEBARON: They had
threatened his family with a


211
0:8:15,75 --> 0:8:16,12
hand grenade.


212
0:8:16,12 --> 0:8:17,84
SHANE SMITH: So they said they'd
blow up the family with


213
0:8:17,84 --> 0:8:19,0
the grenade unless
he surrendered.


214
0:8:19,0 --> 0:8:21,5
BRENT LEBARON: Unless
he opened the door.


215
0:8:21,5 --> 0:8:23,28
MALE SPEAKER: They shot them
four times in the head each.


216
0:8:23,28 --> 0:8:26,17
10 children under the age of
seven were left orphans when


217
0:8:26,17 --> 0:8:27,42
that happened.


218
0:8:27,42 --> 0:10:27,42
