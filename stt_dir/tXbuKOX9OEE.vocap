###1 So why is it that you guys are so infatuated with fire.
###4 It seems like every time we do an experiment, your comment
###7 is, more fire, we need more-- well, truth be told, I'm
###10 infatuated with fire as well.
###11 And this is the kind of episode where most shows would
###15 say, don't try anything at home.
###16 And that's kind of the problem.
###18 This is what we want you to be able to try.
###20 So, a couple things said.
###21 You're going to be using flammable materials.
###23 There's a couple things that you need.
###25 First of all, safety glasses.
###26 And secondly, you need a fire extinguisher.
###29 You don't have those two, you can't do this at home.
###32 And third, if you're a kid, you got to have adult
###34 supervision.
###35 If you're an adult who is careless, you need to have a
###39 better adult to give you better adult supervision.
###42 Make sense?
###42 I think you're going like this.
###43 Watch.
###44 So here are the things we need.
###45 So we need some isopropyl alcohol--
###46 this is just rubbing alcohol, 70%--
###49 something to mix it in, water-- just in case we get
###51 into trouble--
###52 some tongs, and of course, the lighter.
###55 So here's what happens, let's start
###56 with the rubbing alcohol.
###58 And now, we need something that will catch on fire.
###62 Ah, this is perfect.
###63 Lunch money.
###65 I don't know even a lunch that you could buy using a dollar,
###68 but a long time ago, this, I guess, was your lunch money.
###70 All right, so this goes down--
###72 and you always borrow this.
###74 This is where we say, don't try this at home, try it at a
###76 friend's home, right?
###77 Well you always use a friend's bill as well.
###80 So you say, can I please borrow some money, and they,
###82 of course, will only give you a dollar.
###84 It's a hundred times better if you could get a hundred dollar
###86 bill, but good luck.
###88 So this dips down inside.
###89 This is our flammable material, here.
###91 OK.
###92 You ready?
###93 Watch this.
###94 This is off to the side like this.
###96 And now let's light it and see what happens.
###99 Oh, that's a nice flame, looks good.
###101 And--
###103 perfect.
###104 It's out.
###105 Well, there was a little bit of trickery.
###107 Although we used all the materials that you see on the
###109 table, if you had done it exactly the way I just showed
###112 you, there would have been a problem.
###113 And I'll show you what that looks like.
###115 We actually used a real dollar bill, but this solution here
###118 isn't actually just 70% rubbing alcohol.
###121 Let me show you what would happen if you would have used
###123 real rubbing alcohol in its full strength.
###125 
###128 Now we pull it out of the way so that nothing
###130 else catches on fire.
###132 Watch what happens with pure rubbing alcohol.
###136 It burns and it burns.
###138 And then, it continues to burn, and it burns, and you'll
###143 notice that it continues to burn.
###145 And well, this is a problem, because now you've destroyed
###149 money, and you might think that there's going to be
###152 another problem on top of that.
###154 Come to find out, the way the law reads, you can destroy
###157 money and not go to jail.
###159 You just can't destroy money and try to pass it.
###161 That's counterfeit, right.
###163 And I think you can see there's just no possible way
###166 that I think you can probably pass that.
###169 You know as a kid, you would take a penny and you'd go to
###171 the circus or that place, and you'd put it in that machine
###174 and crank it, and it would flatten the penny and put a
###176 logo on there or you just got a name or your birthday, or
###179 whatever it is.
###180 That is kind of the same thing that we're doing here.
###183 It's destroying the penny, but by law, that's OK to do
###187 because you'd never take that penny and then
###189 try to pass it again.
###190 Same thing here.
###190 We're not trying to pass it.
###191 The whole goal is that you're not lighting the
###193 bill on fire at all.
###194 I just wanted you to see what would happen if you really had
###196 done it the way I told you.
###198 Here's the secret.
###199 First of all, 70% rubbing alcohol-- isopropyl alcohol--
###202 means that there's seven parts of the isopropyl alcohol to
###206 three parts water, right.
###207 So there's already water in this mixture.
###209 And at the very beginning, I said, this is everything that
###211 you'll need.
###212 The secret was sitting in front of you the entire time
###214 and it was actually right here.
###215 It's the water that's in this pitcher.
###218 What we want is we want to add more water to the isopropyl
###222 alcohol so that what happens is that we
###224 burn off that fuel--
###226 but by the time the fuel burns off, the evaporating water
###230 that has coated the dollar bill as
###232 well begins to evaporate.
###234 And as it begins to evaporate, it cools the bill down.
###237 So here's the mixture that you're going to need.
###239 This all varies, so you're going to have to experiment a
###242 little bit.
###242 And I think you can do the dollar to experiment.
###246 Here's 70% rubbing alcohol, and we're going to add--
###249 I'm going to put about 300 milliliters.
###251 I'm going to add about 200 milliliters, which again, is
###255 going to be about 3/4 of a cup if you're doing it that way,
###258 of water, and there's your mixture.
###260 It looks just like rubbing alcohol, and that entire
###263 mixture got put back into the bottle.
###265 So I hadn't dumped that last little part out and put it
###268 back into bottle so that you didn't know that I had done
###271 anything to it.
###272 There is a little secret.
###273 If you use this mixture right here, it's going to burn
###276 awfully blue, so you need some salt.
###279 And if you put some salt inside, the sodium from the
###281 salt will help kind of color it yellow.
###283 The salt dissolves with no problem at all.
###286 Good.
###287 And now just kind of stir it up.
###288 
###292 All right.
###292 Now our special watered-down mixture goes
###295 back into the container.
###298 That's perfect.
###299 And now we're ready to go.
###301 This is the set up.
###304 This looks awfully science-y, so you could
###306 substitute a bowl.
###308 That'll be perfect.
###309 You need a friend's dollar bill.
###310 Friend?
###311 Got a dollar bill, that's perfect, and now
###313 you're ready to go.
###314 All right.
###314 So now we put the mixture out.
###317 Again, we're telling them that, look, it's
###319 just rubbing alcohol.
###320 But you know that it's a mixture of
###322 rubbing alcohol and water.
###323 And now, here's the cool thing.
###324 When you take this, the secret is you've got to completely
###327 soak the dollar bill.
###328 If you don't soak the dollar bill, then it's easy for it to
###331 catch on fire.
###332 So just make sure it's completely soaked.
###334 Move this container off to the side, and now we're simply
###338 going to light this on fire.
###340 What's going to burn, instead of the dollar
###342 bill, is the fuel.
###343 Look at that nice yellow kind of look there.
###345 And--
###346 it's perfectly fine.
###348 Now if you're trying this and you see that it starts to
###350 burn, just shake it for a second and it will come out,
###353 and you may have to tweak the formula just
###355 a little tiny bit.
###356 But your dollar bill is back.
###358 You can't tell this, but right now, it's cool to the touch.
###360 So anybody who touches it will be amazed that it feels cold.
###363 It was just on fire, but it's cold.
###364 And of course, that adds to the secret and kind of gives
###367 away that part of it, that it's the evaporating water
###370 that kind of keeps this safe.
###372 All right, so this is the true test of your solution, if it
###374 really is going to work.
###375 This makes you a little bit nervous.
###377 All right, so there's the hundred dollar bill.
###379 This goes down inside like this.
###382 I'm going to make sure that every little piece of this is
###385 completely soaked.
###387 If you paid your dues in the local science club, you've
###391 done well--
###392 I'll move this out of the way--
###393 hopefully everything will be just fine.
###396 Watch.
###399 There it burns.
###399 It's looking good, it's looking good, and--
###402 bam.
###404 It's there.
###404 Look at this.
###406 There is my good hundred dollar bill.
###410 I know what you're thinking.
###411 Let's say you're watching us from another country, and
###413 you're thinking well, does it work with my money.
###414 We have this huge following in the UK, so you just use your
###418 UK, your pounds.
###419 Do you have any pounds?
###421 This is a pound, got it.
###423 Let's see if it works.
###425 This goes down into the water like this.
###427 I've never tried this before, so this will be interesting.
###429 
###432 OK, ready?
###434 This is really thin and flimsy.
###436 Your money is going to be much better than this.
###438 Let's just see if this is OK.
###440 Watch.
###442 That's looking pretty good.
###443 And--
###445 that's truly amazing.
###446 Look at that.
###446 With just notebook paper, it's still perfectly fine.
###451 That's pretty cool.
###452 All right, so you want to try this and you want to use
###454 paper, right?
###455 And you might say, I'm not using my money--
###457 although that is the best way to do it.
###459 You can do it the original way that I learned how to do it
###462 using a man's handkerchief.
###464 I know you don't use these today, but just head to the
###466 local department store, you can find a piece of cloth or a
###469 man's handkerchief.
###470 We just need to have ceilings that are higher than what you
###473 see here, otherwise it's going to be a much more exciting
###476 science experiment than I'd ever want.
###478 Let's go to bigger and higher ceilings.
###480 Taller ceilings, safety glasses, we're going to use
###482 the man's handkerchief, and we need a fire extinguisher, so
###486 make sure that you have a fire--
###487 Bo, you got a fire extinguisher?
###488 OK, here's your job.
###489 Stand close by.
###490 You hang on to this.
###491 If anything bad happens and I start to catch on
###493 fire, take me off.
###495 Pull the pin and go for it, OK.
###496 Don't get overactive, I'm not catching on fire, just stay
###499 there, all right.
###500 See this, so excited to maybe get to pull the fire
###503 extinguisher.
###503 OK, here we go.
###504 Are we ready.
###504 So here is the cloth.
###507 Now this one here, you really got to work on kind of getting
###512 it nice and wet.
###513 OK, nice and wet.
###515 And now you're going to take this out, and we're going to
###519 wring it out.
###520 
###522 The other thing I can tell you is that you want to make sure
###525 that your hands now are not wet.
###527 So now, dry your hands off.
###530 OK, perfect.
###534 Now my hands are completely dry.
###536 All right, move this out of the way.
###538 It's time for fire.
###541 Hopefully, the water will keep it nice and safe.
###546 Here we go.
###547 Oh, this is looking good.
###549 So here it is.
###551 Now this is a pretty good flame, you definitely don't
###553 want to do this in your house.
###555 This is outside.
###556 Here's the flame.
###559 Look at that, isn't that awesome.
###561 Look.
###562 To the touch, it's fine.
###564 It's not singed.
###566 Ta-da.
###567 Take your bow.
###569 The secret is water.
###570 It keeps the material from catching on fire.
###573 And whether you're doing it with a dollar bill or you're
###575 doing it with a handkerchief, the secret is trapping water
###577 close to the surface, because the evaporation of that water
###581 produces this cooling effect.
###583 Water is this great conductor of heat.
###586 And we're not just messing around with this.
###587 This is actually being used as a fire-fighting technique.
###589 They're finding ways to be able to take water, make it
###593 sticky, so to speak, and to put it on a structure like a
###595 building and try to keep it from burning.
###597 And believe it or not, you might have played
###598 with it as a toy.
###600 The toy is called Gravi-Goo.
###602 It's actually a powder that you can see inside.
###605 It's really a very, very high molecular weight polymer,
###609 polymer just being a long chain of molecules.
###611 Look, we haven't used much there at all, you can see that
###613 little bit sitting in the bottom.
###615 Let me add the water.
###617 And now you just keep on pouring it back and forth.
###620 The super-absorbent polymer will literally pull itself out
###624 of the beaker like a self-siphoning gel.
###627 So here's the batch that I made previously.
###630 This is probably four or five of these batches.
###632 And now, I'm going to get my hands inside so we can kind of
###635 play with it, and you can see what it looks like.
###637 
###642 It's extremely sticky, and it's almost
###645 completely made of water.
###649 Here's the test, nothing terribly scientific, but
###652 here's our board.
###653 And let's take some of this polymer in the water and put
###660 it on the board like this.
###662 Perfect.
###664 Now we just test it with the fire.
###666 Watch the side of the board without the polymer.
###668 Watch.
###669 
###674 It doesn't take long at all for that to start on fire.
###677 Watch this over here.
###678 
###684 See, it's the heat-absorbing properties of the water that
###686 are keeping the board safe.
###688 Now eventually, it'll catch on fire because it will burn all
###690 the way through.
###691 But it definitely is better than no water at all to be
###697 able to help mitigate any of the damage.
###699 Am I saying that this toy right here is going to save a
###703 burning structure?
###704 No, but I think the science of it is very, very solid.
###707 If you can get water close to the structure and allow the
###710 heat from the fire to be able to cause the water to
###713 evaporate, it only makes sense that you're going to buy time
###716 for firefighters as they try to save the property.
###720 Who would have thought that the science of toys could help
###724 possibly save a burning structure.
