###29 RYAN DUFFY: So it's the 13th year of the Chavez regime here
###32 in Venezuela, and his Bolivarian revolution has left
###35 the country deeply divided along political lines.
###37 And despite its egalitarian aims, the economic divide
###41 between the haves and the have-nots remains staggering.
###44 Despite all this, in this election year, the issue that
###47 will decide the future of this country is violence.
###50 Venezuela has become known as one of the most dangerous
###53 countries in the world, and last year alone, Caracas had
###56 more violent deaths than Baghdad.
###58 
###62 With a population a tenth the size of the United States,
###66 Venezuela last year managed to record more
###68 murders than America.
###69 An astonishing 19,000 violent deaths in a
###73 population of 29 million.
###75 LUIS CEDENO: If you want to compare with wars going on in
###77 other countries, they don't have that
###80 death toll every week.
###82 So we have to ask ourselves, are we in a state of war?
###86 
###90 RYAN DUFFY: With the protection of Caracas' finest,
###92 we headed to Pitara--
###93 a sprawling slum where a shocking percentage of the
###96 city's violence happens--
###97 to get a lay of the criminal landscape.
###100 There's probably two ways to go to this neighborhood, with
###102 the guys who run it from the inside, and the guys who
###104 control it from the outside, otherwise, the guys with guns.

###123 RYAN DUFFY: I was feeling OK about this until the eight
###126 hundred disclaimers about what to do when and if we come
###129 under fire, and here's the evacuation, and
###132 hide under the tires.
###134 And all that kind of made it a little more real.
###137 We spoke with Luis Cedeno, the head of Paz Activa, an NGO
###141 that tracks violence in Venezuela.
###143 LUIS CEDENO: What violence you would see in Pitara?
###145 You would see gang violence.
###147 When these gangs have a shoot out, you're in the middle of
###151 the shoot out, you're going to get hurt.
###154 RYAN DUFFY: The craziest part is that this isn't organized
###156 narco-violence, this is petty, you looked at my sister
###159 sideways, street bullshit.
###161 Someone turns the corner and shoots at him and misses,
###166 either you or I is going to die.

###180 RYAN DUFFY: In Caracas, living in Pitara
###181 counts as probable cause.
###183 FELIX JEREZ RIVERA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###184 
###187 LUIS CEDENO: There are actually little arsenals in
###189 every barrio.
###190 You can go there and you can actually buy a gun, buy
###193 ammunition, access to grenades.
###196 You can actually rent the gun if you don't want to buy it,
###198 and it's a lot cheaper.

###214 RYAN DUFFY: Just made a stop here on the patrol.
###217 Looks like a guy was not just drunk driving, but actually
###220 drinking while he was driving.
###221 
###224 And apparently drinking and driving isn't a big deal here.
###228 On an average day in Venezuela,
###230 58 people are murdered.
###232 This is my nervous tic.
###232 The entire time we were with the cops, of the radio was
###235 crackling with reports of killings all around the city,
###238 and we were soon in pursuit of an armed suspect.

###247 RYAN DUFFY: With over 90% of crimes in Venezuela going
###250 unsolved, it wasn't quite a surprise that this call ended
###253 without a suspect.

###316 RYAN DUFFY: Although the slums have always had problems with
###318 violence, it's only in the last decade that it has risen
###321 to war zone levels.
###322 So the question is, what the hell happened
###325 in the last 10 years?

###335 RYAN DUFFY: Venezuela is ruled by socialist
###336 superhero, Hugo Chavez.
###338 A man who, at a glance, seems completely out of his mind.
###342 HUGO CHAVEZ: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###343 
###354 RYAN DUFFY: Despite its third world crime stats, Venezuela
###357 isn't exactly a poor country.
###359 It's a massive oil industry produces 2.5
###362 million barrels a day.
###363 Most of which is consumed by the United States.
###366 And the country has larger proven
###368 reserves than Saudi Arabia.
###370 Before he took power, foreign companies like Exxon Mobil
###373 made huge profits from Venezuela's oil fields.
###376 But when Chavez nationalized the industry and sent the
###378 multinationals packing, all those profits went directly
###382 into government accounts.
###384 But despite this, and after 13 years of power, he still
###387 shifts the blame for the problems of violence and
###389 poverty onto previous governments.

###399 RYAN DUFFY: But in October, the Bolivarian Revolution
###401 faces its toughest electoral challenge ever from Henrique
###404 Capriles Radonski who's hoping to tap into the public's
###408 pent-up frustration over the violence
###410 issue among other things.
###412 But even with a strong opponent and his fierce battle
###415 with cancer, Chavez is still plowing forward with his
###417 socialist agenda.
