2
0:0:1,82 --> 0:0:1,79
BEN EBBRELL: Hey.


3
0:0:1,79 --> 0:0:2,7
We're SORTEDFood.


4
0:0:2,7 --> 0:0:5,214
And today, we're here to show
you a YouTube Crush cocktail.


5
0:0:5,214 --> 0:0:7,5
BARRY TAYLOR: This is
our pomegranate kiss.


6
0:0:7,5 --> 0:0:8,84
BEN EBBRELL: And it needs to
start off with a loving kiss.


7
0:0:8,84 --> 0:0:9,4
MIKE HUTTLESTONE: OK.


8
0:0:9,4 --> 0:0:9,805
I've got this covered.


9
0:0:9,805 --> 0:0:10,49
BARRY TAYLOR: Oh, god.


10
0:0:10,49 --> 0:0:11,12
MIKE HUTTLESTONE: You carry on.


11
0:0:11,12 --> 0:0:13,1
BEN EBBRELL: So here,
we've got 3/4 bottle


12
0:0:13,1 --> 0:0:14,66
of pomegranate juice.


13
0:0:14,66 --> 0:0:18,14
Reduce down in a pan with a
couple of tablespoons of sugar


14
0:0:18,14 --> 0:0:21,71
until it becomes really,
really syrupy and sweet.


15
0:0:21,71 --> 0:0:23,72
BARRY TAYLOR: Mike, have
you done this before?


16
0:0:23,72 --> 0:0:26,849
BEN EBBRELL: Apply and smear.


17
0:0:26,849 --> 0:0:28,14
MIKE HUTTLESTONE: There you go.


18
0:0:28,14 --> 0:0:28,46
Not bad.


19
0:0:28,46 --> 0:0:29,42
BEN EBBRELL: Job done.


20
0:0:29,42 --> 0:0:32,32
Now, for the actual cocktail--
I'll leave that to one side.


21
0:0:32,32 --> 0:0:35,821
Baz, 50-50 pomegranate juice.


22
0:0:35,821 --> 0:0:36,32
Why?


23
0:0:36,32 --> 0:0:38,413
Because it's tropical and
every Valentine's drink


24
0:0:38,413 --> 0:0:39,91
needs to be pink-- so 50-50.


25
0:0:39,91 --> 0:0:41,493
BARRY TAYLOR: Of
course, it has to be.


26
0:0:41,493 --> 0:0:42,7
How much?


27
0:0:42,7 --> 0:0:43,55
BEN EBBRELL: 50-50,
so that's fine.


28
0:0:43,55 --> 0:0:45,903
Equal measure of
ginger ale, and that's


29
0:0:45,903 --> 0:0:47,2
there for the fiery kick.


30
0:0:47,2 --> 0:0:47,23
MIKE HUTTLESTONE: Yeah.


31
0:0:47,23 --> 0:0:49,605
Fiery passion-- also
important to a relationship.


32
0:0:49,605 --> 0:0:50,32
BARRY TAYLOR: What are
you getting at, Mike?


33
0:0:50,32 --> 0:0:51,78
MIKE HUTTLESTONE: I'm
talking like I'm an expert.


34
0:0:51,78 --> 0:0:52,614
[LAUGHTER]


35
0:0:52,614 --> 0:0:54,945
BEN EBBRELL: It's all
about balancing flavors.


36
0:0:54,945 --> 0:0:56,46
There we go.


37
0:0:56,46 --> 0:0:59,21
And then perhaps a
little bit of a cliche,


38
0:0:59,21 --> 0:1:2,46
but we've got to pop a cork.


39
0:1:2,46 --> 0:1:3,33
There we go.


40
0:1:3,33 --> 0:1:3,89
MIKE HUTTLESTONE: Don't
aim it towards me.


41
0:1:3,89 --> 0:1:6,466
BARRY TAYLOR: [INAUDIBLE]
impress the date by--


42
0:1:6,466 --> 0:1:9,123
BEN EBBRELL: And we've
crushed up some ice.


43
0:1:9,123 --> 0:1:12,112
Our ginger and pomegranate
in over the ice.


44
0:1:12,112 --> 0:1:13,695
BARRY TAYLOR: Look
how pretty that is.


45
0:1:13,695 --> 0:1:14,736
MIKE HUTTLESTONE: Mm-hmm.


46
0:1:14,736 --> 0:1:16,93
BEN EBBRELL: And then
finish it with the fizz.


47
0:1:16,93 --> 0:1:17,82
BARRY TAYLOR: Ben, did you
make this one for yourself


48
0:1:17,82 --> 0:1:18,79
rather than your date?


49
0:1:18,79 --> 0:1:19,29
MIKE HUTTLESTONE:
This is what he's


50
0:1:19,29 --> 0:1:22,27
going to be drinking by
himself on Valentine's night.


51
0:1:22,27 --> 0:1:23,44
BEN EBBRELL: Beautiful.


52
0:1:23,44 --> 0:1:26,565
Every Valentine loves
a perfume fragrance.


53
0:1:26,565 --> 0:1:27,44
BARRY TAYLOR: Indeed.


54
0:1:27,44 --> 0:1:28,91
BEN EBBRELL: So here,
we've got some basil.


55
0:1:28,91 --> 0:1:29,82
It might sound weird.


56
0:1:29,82 --> 0:1:30,22
MIKE HUTTLESTONE: Yeah.


57
0:1:30,22 --> 0:1:30,62
BARRY TAYLOR: A little bit.


58
0:1:30,62 --> 0:1:33,25
BEN EBBRELL: So basil with
ginger, absolutely beautiful.


59
0:1:33,25 --> 0:1:34,15
That can go in there.


60
0:1:34,15 --> 0:1:36,45
Top it right up now
those bubbles have died.


61
0:1:36,45 --> 0:1:39,4
BARRY TAYLOR: Be generous.


62
0:1:39,4 --> 0:1:42,9
BEN EBBRELL: And finish
it with a pincher


63
0:1:42,9 --> 0:1:43,82
berry, or a physalis fruit.


64
0:1:43,82 --> 0:1:46,772
And that just sits
on top of there.


65
0:1:46,772 --> 0:1:47,73
MIKE HUTTLESTONE: Nice.


66
0:1:47,73 --> 0:1:51,91
BEN EBBRELL: Basil, pincher
berry, pomegranate, ginger,


67
0:1:51,91 --> 0:1:54,88
champagne-- that's
our YouTube Crush


68
0:1:54,88 --> 0:1:58,689
cocktail for your
Valentine sorted.


69
0:1:58,689 --> 0:1:59,48
BARRY TAYLOR: Look.


70
0:1:59,48 --> 0:2:0,64
How easy is that?


71
0:2:0,64 --> 0:2:1,71
MIKE HUTTLESTONE: But
if you missed any of it,


72
0:2:1,71 --> 0:2:4,0
you can check out the full
recipe in the description box


73
0:2:4,0 --> 0:2:4,46
below.


74
0:2:4,46 --> 0:2:4,56
BEN EBBRELL: Here.


75
0:2:4,56 --> 0:2:5,4
Have a taste.


76
0:2:5,4 --> 0:2:6,9
I'll crack on, make some more.


77
0:2:6,9 --> 0:2:7,48
BARRY TAYLOR: Boomtown!


78
0:2:7,48 --> 0:4:7,48
