###21 SUROOSH ALVI: So we're here in Baghdad.
###23 Right down there, that's Firdos Square.
###25 That's where the famous scene took place where Saddam
###29 Hussein's statue was pulled down.
###31 We came here in 2006 when we filmed "Heavy Metal in
###34 Baghdad."
###36 It was a very, very different city then.
###37 It was the height of the insurgency.
###39 It was a war zone, full occupation.
###43 And that occupation is now over.
###45 A year ago, America pulled out their troops.
###47 BARACK OBAMA: Tonight, I am announcing that the American
###50 combat mission in Iraq has ended.
###53 Operation Iraqi Freedom is over.
###56 Last February, I announced a plan that would bring our
###59 combat brigades out of Iraq, while re-doubling our efforts
###62 to strengthen Iraq's security forces and support its
###65 government and people.
###67 That's what we've done.
###69 SUROOSH ALVI: We found it strange that Baghdad is not in
###71 the news at all these days.
###73 What happened?
###73 It was the biggest news story in the world
###76 for almost a decade.
###77 And then overnight, it's over.
###79 So we wanted to come here and see what the effects of this
###83 occupation were.
###84 
###91 When the Americans left, prime minister Nouri Al-Malaki
###94 intensified his efforts to consolidate power among the
###97 Shia majority.
###98 This Sunni minority, a group that enjoyed great privilege
###101 under Saddam Hussein, have been marginalized.
###104 Naturally, the Sunnis are not taking this lying down.
###108 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###109 
###121 SUROOSH ALVI: Massive protests in Sunni areas and a surge of
###124 sectarian killings throughout the country become the new
###127 normal in postwar Iraq.
###129 In 2012 alone, there were more than 1,600 deaths.
###136 Through making "Heavy Metal in Baghdad," we met Waleed, the
###139 original singer of Acrassicauda.
###141 At the time, they were the only metal band in Iraq.
###145 [METAL MUSIC PLAYING]
###150 But shortly after that meeting, Waleed was forced to
###153 flee the country and seek refugee status in the West
###156 after receiving numerous death threats.
###159 With the war officially over, Waleed decided it was time to
###162 return to Iraq.
###163 It would be his first visit home since he left in 2004.
###167 We sent a cameraman to accompany him on this trip and
###169 made plans to meet up with them once we arrived.
###172 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]

###192 WALEED MOUDHAFAR: I don't even know what I'm going to do when
###194 I see my mother.
###195 
###198 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###199 
###240 SUROOSH ALVI: We arrived in Baghdad a few hours after
###241 Waleed and were headed to the guest house
###244 where we'd be staying.
###245 But that's when we ran into the [INAUDIBLE].
###247 They're a group of young punks who are
###249 basically totally insane.
###251 [MOTORCYCLES REVVING]
###265 SUROOSH ALVI: We're with a Baghdadi biker gang.
###268 We were wondering what do kids in Baghdad do for fun.
###270 Well, this is it.
###271 
###273 A variety of different styles, kind of this hybrid soccer
###277 player meets Mad Max look, which is my personal favorite.
###282 Then there's this guy, who's got the full on Fox Racing
###284 gear, leather from head to toe.
###288 This guy is riding with his flip flops.
###290 It doesn't seem totally wise.
###291 
###294 I worry about that guy.
###296 I'm not sure he's going to survive the day.
###297 
###300 So you guys are the [INAUDIBLE].
###302 Are there other gangs in other cities, like Sadr City?
###304 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###306 
###309 SUROOSH ALVI: So do you ever get in trouble with the cops?
###312 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###315 SUROOSH ALVI: Do they chase you?
###316 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###317 
###329 SUROOSH ALVI: What happened?
###329 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###331 
###333 [MOTORCYCLES REVVING]
###340 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###341 
###354 SUROOSH ALVI: Do you guys have more freedom now, or before?
###358 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###359 
###362 SUROOSH ALVI: Now, that sentiment, a seemingly
###364 contradictory one of wanting freedom but at same time,
###368 missing the rule of Saddam Hussein, was something we
###370 would hear again and again.
###372 And while these guys long for American style liberties--
###376 at least surface level liberties, like, dressing
###378 however the hell you want and acting like a maniac--
###380 it was clear that they would trade it all for the stability
###383 that they enjoyed under Saddam Hussein's
###385 notoriously cruel regime.
###386 
###396 -[SPEAKING ARABIC]
###398 
###404 -Look at this fucking shit, man.
###405 Have you noticed every street has a check point.
###408 SUROOSH ALVI: Put it down.
