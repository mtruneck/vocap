1
0:1:8,927 --> 0:1:42,56
He's coming! He's coming!


2
0:1:42,56 --> 0:1:44,229
All right, now.


3
0:1:44,229 --> 0:1:51,936
Let's give a good
Colorado welcome here!


4
0:1:51,936 --> 0:1:54,906
- Hello, sir. You're most welcome.
- Thank you, thank you.


5
0:1:54,906 --> 0:1:56,908
All right, everybody, listen up.


6
0:1:56,908 --> 0:2:3,748
I want to introduce you
to Oscar Wilde.


7
0:2:3,748 --> 0:2:6,884
Welcome to
the Matchless Silver Mine.


8
0:2:6,884 --> 0:2:9,32
Today, we opened up a new seam.


9
0:2:9,32 --> 0:2:11,556
We're gonna name it after you.


10
0:2:11,556 --> 0:2:13,157
How very kind.


11
0:2:13,157 --> 0:2:18,329
I look forward to collecting
the royalties.


12
0:2:18,329 --> 0:2:20,832
Now, why don't you
follow me over here.


13
0:2:20,832 --> 0:2:26,971
Great lecture you gave last night.
We're honored to have you visit us.


14
0:2:26,971 --> 0:2:50,561
If you'd just like to step in here.
There ya go, sir.


15
0:2:50,561 --> 0:2:52,73
I thought I was descending
into hell...


16
0:2:52,73 --> 0:2:56,834
but with these angel faces to greet me,
it must be paradise.


17
0:2:56,834 --> 0:2:59,304
Is this the way to my personal seam?


18
0:2:59,304 --> 0:3:2,373
Of course, I should have preferred
gold... purple and gold.


19
0:3:2,373 --> 0:3:6,744
But we live in a Silver Age, alas.


20
0:3:6,744 --> 0:3:10,48
So much that is exquisitely beautiful
is wrought from suffering, from pain...


21
0:3:10,48 --> 0:3:14,319
from toil... broken bones
and blistered skin.


22
0:3:14,319 --> 0:3:17,88
Benevenuto Cellini understood silver.


23
0:3:17,88 --> 0:3:19,891
He took the metal that you mine
so nobly down here...


24
0:3:19,891 --> 0:3:23,127
and transformed it into works of art
for popes and princes.


25
0:3:23,127 --> 0:3:25,563
Cellini... is he a wop?


26
0:3:25,563 --> 0:3:28,333
The Renaissance man, in every sense.


27
0:3:28,333 --> 0:3:31,235
The greatest silversmith
the world has ever seen...


28
0:3:31,235 --> 0:3:33,971
but a genius in life
as well as art.


29
0:3:33,971 --> 0:3:37,375
He experimented with
every vice known to man.


30
0:3:37,375 --> 0:3:39,444
- He committed murder.
- He killed a man?


31
0:3:39,444 --> 0:3:46,584
More than one.


32
0:3:46,584 --> 0:3:50,588
Thank you.


33
0:3:50,588 --> 0:3:53,558
I'd like to meet Cellini.
Why didn't you bring him with you?


34
0:3:53,558 --> 0:3:55,393
I'm afraid he's dead.


35
0:3:55,393 --> 0:4:52,717
Who shot him?


36
0:4:52,717 --> 0:4:57,989
Is Miss Lloyd connected
to Lloyd's Bank?


37
0:4:57,989 --> 0:4:59,457
A pity.


38
0:4:59,457 --> 0:5:1,559
But she's comfortable, Ada.


39
0:5:1,559 --> 0:5:3,327
A thousand a year.


40
0:5:3,327 --> 0:5:5,463
Then I congratulate you, Lady Wilde.


41
0:5:5,463 --> 0:5:9,167
Now that Oscar's been to America
and sown his Wildean oats...


42
0:5:9,167 --> 0:5:11,35
it's time he settled down.


43
0:5:11,35 --> 0:5:12,804
But weren't they very rough?


44
0:5:12,804 --> 0:5:15,173
No, charming.
Well, charming to me.


45
0:5:15,173 --> 0:5:17,442
With each other, it's true
they could be a little brusque.


46
0:5:17,442 --> 0:5:20,812
They hanged two men in the theater
one night before I gave a lecture.


47
0:5:20,812 --> 0:5:26,818
I felt like the sorbet
after a side of beef.


48
0:5:26,818 --> 0:5:30,221
I know your friend is famous, Ada...
notorious, at least...


49
0:5:30,221 --> 0:5:32,99
but I don't understand for what.


50
0:5:32,99 --> 0:5:36,6
For being himself,
Lady Mount-Temple.


51
0:5:36,6 --> 0:5:38,463
Don't Americans talk
the most wonderful slang, though?


52
0:5:38,463 --> 0:5:40,765
Well, I did hear one lady say...


53
0:5:40,765 --> 0:5:43,401
"After the heel-lick
I shifted my day goods."


54
0:5:43,401 --> 0:5:46,3
What on earth did she mean?


55
0:5:46,3 --> 0:5:49,407
She meant that she changed
her clothes after a dance.


56
0:5:49,407 --> 0:5:54,545
Connie, my love, Lady Mount-Temple
is so anxious to meet you.


57
0:5:54,545 --> 0:5:56,547
I knew your father, Miss Lloyd.


58
0:5:56,547 --> 0:6:0,751
She's delightful, and not stupid.
Really, not stupid at all.


59
0:6:0,751 --> 0:6:3,754
Is that quite a reason to marry her?


60
0:6:3,754 --> 0:6:7,758
Well, I must marry someone.


61
0:6:7,758 --> 0:6:10,595
And my mother has our future
planned out in every detail:


62
0:6:10,595 --> 0:6:14,198
I'm to go into Parliament,
we're to have a nice house...


63
0:6:14,198 --> 0:6:16,767
and live a proper, settled life...
literature, lectures...


64
0:6:16,767 --> 0:6:20,137
the House of Commons, receptions
for the world in general at 5:00.


65
0:6:20,137 --> 0:6:21,506
How dreary.


66
0:6:21,506 --> 0:6:24,308
Your attendance will
not be required at those.


67
0:6:24,308 --> 0:6:27,712
But your sphinxiness will be essential
for our intimate little dinners at 8:00.


68
0:6:27,712 --> 0:6:31,649
It will be a grand life,
a charming life.


69
0:6:31,649 --> 0:6:34,285
I see Constance will be busy
preparing the dinners...


70
0:6:34,285 --> 0:6:36,821
but what will she contribute
to the literature and lectures?


71
0:6:36,821 --> 0:6:38,823
She'll correct the proofs
of my articles.


72
0:6:38,823 --> 0:6:48,766
Oh, what a little sunbeam.


73
0:6:48,766 --> 0:6:52,3
I do love her, Ada. She's...


74
0:6:52,3 --> 0:6:54,238
Silent.


75
0:6:54,238 --> 0:6:58,643
- I find her very silent.
- But so sympathetic.


76
0:6:58,643 --> 0:7:38,49
And I do need an audience.


77
0:7:38,49 --> 0:7:43,354
I don't see how you can possibly
take it all in, reading at that speed.


78
0:7:43,354 --> 0:7:44,956
Try me.


79
0:7:44,956 --> 0:7:51,696
I know better.


80
0:7:51,696 --> 0:7:53,531
Where are we dining tonight?


81
0:7:53,531 --> 0:7:55,199
At the Leversons.


82
0:7:55,199 --> 0:7:59,37
Then you must show your true colors
as a propagandist for dress reform.


83
0:7:59,37 --> 0:8:2,39
The cinnamon
cashmere trousers, I think.


84
0:8:2,39 --> 0:8:5,91
And the cape with the ends
that turn up into sleeves.


85
0:8:5,91 --> 0:8:16,153
I don't think I can wear
those trousers anymore.


86
0:8:16,153 --> 0:8:18,155
A new Wilde for the world!


87
0:8:18,155 --> 0:8:23,761
Another genius for Ireland!


88
0:8:23,761 --> 0:8:36,674
We shall have to buy you
a whole new wardrobe.


89
0:8:36,674 --> 0:8:38,943
Ernest proposed to me
under that statue.


90
0:8:38,943 --> 0:8:42,113
Really, the things that go on in front
of works of art are quite appalling.


91
0:8:42,113 --> 0:8:44,48
The police should interfere.


92
0:8:44,48 --> 0:8:48,285
We were made not to marry,
whereas you and Constance are so happy.


93
0:8:48,285 --> 0:8:49,787
Everyone says so.


94
0:8:49,787 --> 0:8:52,957
It's perfectly monstrous how people
say things behind one's back...


95
0:8:52,957 --> 0:8:55,76
that are absolutely true.


96
0:8:55,76 --> 0:8:59,3
So your audience has proved
as responsive as you hoped?


97
0:8:59,3 --> 0:9:2,233
Receptive, yes. Responsive?


98
0:9:2,233 --> 0:9:4,235
I always wonder what she's thinking.


99
0:9:4,235 --> 0:9:7,571
I expect it's about the baby.


100
0:9:7,571 --> 0:9:10,274
Yes. Well, Constance is
such a natural mother.


101
0:9:10,274 --> 0:9:15,413
She's invited Robbie into the nest
while his parents are abroad.


102
0:9:15,413 --> 0:9:19,483
Robbie is Canadian.
You can tell by his youth.


103
0:9:19,483 --> 0:9:22,486
Have you been brought
to England to mature, Mr. Ross?


104
0:9:22,486 --> 0:9:26,9
Well, that was the idea,
but it doesn't seem to be working.


105
0:9:26,9 --> 0:9:30,94
I've lived here since I was three,
and you see the pitiful result.


106
0:9:30,94 --> 0:9:32,863
Robbie comes from a long line
of imperial governors.


107
0:9:32,863 --> 0:9:35,332
His grandfather was
Prime Minister of Upper Canada.


108
0:9:35,332 --> 0:9:36,834
Or was it Lower Canada?


109
0:9:36,834 --> 0:9:39,403
The British will take their class system
with them wherever they go.


110
0:9:39,403 --> 0:9:41,405
They apply it even to continents.


111
0:9:41,405 --> 0:9:43,708
Are you planning
to govern a continent?


112
0:9:43,708 --> 0:9:54,285
No. I don't even plan
to govern myself.


113
0:9:54,285 --> 0:9:57,21
Very nicely turned leg.


114
0:9:57,21 --> 0:10:1,358
Hello, sir.


115
0:10:1,358 --> 0:10:4,729
Shall I give you these, my love?
I'll see if I can find a cab.


116
0:10:4,729 --> 0:10:17,208
Coming through there, gents.
Mind your backs.


117
0:10:17,208 --> 0:10:29,987
Can you move
out of the way, please?


118
0:10:29,987 --> 0:10:35,526
Looking for someone?


119
0:10:35,526 --> 0:10:46,57
Cab, cab!


120
0:10:46,57 --> 0:10:48,906
Bedtime.


121
0:10:48,906 --> 0:10:56,547
Just one more cigarette.


122
0:10:56,547 --> 0:11:4,54
No. No, thanks, Robbie.


123
0:11:4,54 --> 0:11:7,658
Don't stay up too late, Robbie.


124
0:11:7,658 --> 0:11:13,564
Good night.


125
0:11:13,564 --> 0:11:16,534
Good night, Oscar.


126
0:11:16,534 --> 0:11:34,51
Good night, Robbie.


127
0:11:34,51 --> 0:11:40,24
He's asleep.


128
0:11:40,24 --> 0:11:45,296
He's so beautiful.


129
0:11:45,296 --> 0:11:50,167
Almost as beautiful
as his mother.


130
0:11:50,167 --> 0:12:15,159
I don't know what I'd do without you,
my constant Constance.


131
0:12:15,159 --> 0:12:18,62
Good night, my dear.


132
0:12:18,62 --> 0:12:40,351
Good night.


133
0:12:40,351 --> 0:12:43,254
A university education
is an admirable thing, of course...


134
0:12:43,254 --> 0:12:46,757
so long as you remember that nothing
worth knowing can ever be taught...


135
0:12:46,757 --> 0:12:48,659
least of all at Cambridge.


136
0:12:48,659 --> 0:12:50,661
But you told me...


137
0:12:50,661 --> 0:12:54,698
in ancient Greece the older men
taught the younger.


138
0:12:54,698 --> 0:12:57,534
They drew them out.


139
0:12:57,534 --> 0:13:1,372
I look forward to being
drawn out immensely.


140
0:13:1,372 --> 0:13:4,441
Yes, well, Greek love...
platonic love...


141
0:13:4,441 --> 0:13:8,646
is the highest form of affection
known to man, of course.


142
0:13:8,646 --> 0:13:10,547
You also told me...


143
0:13:10,547 --> 0:13:13,45
that the Greeks put statues of Apollo
in the bride's chamber...


144
0:13:13,45 --> 0:13:17,388
so she would have beautiful sons.


145
0:13:17,388 --> 0:13:24,361
But I can't help noticing that here
the statue's in your bedroom.


146
0:13:24,361 --> 0:13:43,38
Constance prefers a bath.


147
0:13:43,38 --> 0:13:46,684
She was so beautiful
when I married her, Robbie.


148
0:13:46,684 --> 0:13:49,386
Slim, white as a lily...


149
0:13:49,386 --> 0:13:51,221
such dancing eyes.


150
0:13:51,221 --> 0:13:54,425
I've never seen such love
in a pair of eyes.


151
0:13:54,425 --> 0:14:28,192
She was...


152
0:14:28,192 --> 0:14:31,996
Nothing should reveal the body...


153
0:14:31,996 --> 0:14:35,432
but the body.


154
0:14:35,432 --> 0:14:46,944
Didn't you say?


155
0:14:46,944 --> 0:14:53,217
There has to be a first time
for everything, Oscar...


156
0:14:53,217 --> 0:15:3,761
even for you.


157
0:15:3,761 --> 0:15:7,297
<i>Hush. There's
a good little fellow.</i>


158
0:15:7,297 --> 0:15:11,568
Come on. Come on, now. There.


159
0:15:11,568 --> 0:15:14,905
Now, come on, Cyril.
It's time for your bath.


160
0:15:14,905 --> 0:15:19,91
Be a good boy.
Don't make such a fuss!


161
0:15:19,91 --> 0:15:22,946
You've got to get undressed.
Come on.


162
0:15:22,946 --> 0:15:24,848
I know you hate it.


163
0:15:24,848 --> 0:15:27,918
Boys, Mrs. Wilde,
they never do what they're told.


164
0:15:27,918 --> 0:15:31,288
Oh, we're going to have
a girl next time.


165
0:15:31,288 --> 0:15:37,194
- Aren't we, Oscar?
- I must go.


166
0:15:37,194 --> 0:15:40,64
Good night, my dear.
Now you behave, Cyril.


167
0:15:40,64 --> 0:15:44,435
Remember, a gentleman should take
a bath at least once a year.


168
0:15:44,435 --> 0:15:46,537
- Good night.
- Come on, Cyril.


169
0:15:46,537 --> 0:15:48,105
It's not that bad.


170
0:15:48,105 --> 0:15:51,608
I shan't be back till late.
I'm dining with the Asquiths.


171
0:15:51,608 --> 0:15:53,11
Hush now.


172
0:15:53,11 --> 0:16:33,5
Come on, now.


173
0:16:33,5 --> 0:16:36,987
Do you love me?


174
0:16:36,987 --> 0:16:38,989
I feel...


175
0:16:38,989 --> 0:16:41,391
like a city that's been...


176
0:16:41,391 --> 0:16:45,429
under siege for 20 years.


177
0:16:45,429 --> 0:16:48,165
Suddenly the gates are thrown open...


178
0:16:48,165 --> 0:16:53,704
and the citizens come pouring out...


179
0:16:53,704 --> 0:16:56,14
to breathe the air
and walk the fields...


180
0:16:56,14 --> 0:17:0,611
and pluck the wildflowers.


181
0:17:0,611 --> 0:17:3,18
I feel...


182
0:17:3,18 --> 0:17:8,18
relieved.


183
0:17:8,18 --> 0:17:12,256
You don't worry about Constance?


184
0:17:12,256 --> 0:17:14,625
<i>"Every afternoon,
on their way home from school...</i>


185
0:17:14,625 --> 0:17:17,294
<i>the children used to play
in the garden of the selfish giant. "</i>


186
0:17:17,294 --> 0:17:19,63
Is that the garden where we play?


187
0:17:19,63 --> 0:17:24,268
No, this is much larger and lovelier
than that, with soft green grass.


188
0:17:24,268 --> 0:17:26,103
There's grass where we go.


189
0:17:26,103 --> 0:17:29,773
Yes, but are there 12 peach trees
that burst into delicate blossoms...


190
0:17:29,773 --> 0:17:32,943
of pink and pearl every springtime
and bear rich fruit in the autumn?


191
0:17:32,943 --> 0:17:34,444
Are there, Mama?


192
0:17:34,444 --> 0:17:37,748
I don't think there are,
Cyril, no.


193
0:17:37,748 --> 0:17:41,585
Would you hand me a matchstick,
and I'll put this hussar's head back on?


194
0:17:41,585 --> 0:17:47,991
Thank you.


195
0:17:47,991 --> 0:17:50,827
"The birds sat on the trees
and sang so sweetly...


196
0:17:50,827 --> 0:17:53,297
that the children used
to stop their games to listen.


197
0:17:53,297 --> 0:17:55,866
'How happy we are here,'
they said to each other."


198
0:17:55,866 --> 0:17:58,569
I don't know how they could be happy
if there was a giant.


199
0:17:58,569 --> 0:18:2,639
There wasn't, you see, not yet.
He was away, visiting a friend.


200
0:18:2,639 --> 0:18:5,842
You're always away.


201
0:18:5,842 --> 0:18:9,346
Yes, but I only go for a night or two
at a time, and I always come back.


202
0:18:9,346 --> 0:18:11,915
Whereas this giant,
the one whose garden it was...


203
0:18:11,915 --> 0:18:14,985
he'd been away for seven years,
staying with an ogre in Cornwall.


204
0:18:14,985 --> 0:18:17,688
"And after seven years,
when he'd said all he had to say...


205
0:18:17,688 --> 0:18:21,491
because his conversation
was very limited...


206
0:18:21,491 --> 0:18:24,328
he decided to return home
to his own castle.


207
0:18:24,328 --> 0:18:28,298
When he found the children playing
in his garden, he was very angry.


208
0:18:28,298 --> 0:18:31,101
'What are you doing here? ' he cried.


209
0:18:31,101 --> 0:18:33,537
And all the children ran away.


210
0:18:33,537 --> 0:18:35,772
'My own garden...


211
0:18:35,772 --> 0:18:38,809
is my own garden! '
Said the giant.


212
0:18:38,809 --> 0:18:42,112
'And I won't allow anyone
to play in it except myself.'


213
0:18:42,112 --> 0:18:44,815
So he built a high wall
all around...


214
0:18:44,815 --> 0:18:48,118
put up a large notice board on which
was written, in capital letters:


215
0:18:48,118 --> 0:18:52,889
'Trespassers will be prosecuted."'


216
0:18:52,889 --> 0:18:55,959
Arthur, you're trespassing.
Cyril will now eat you.


217
0:18:55,959 --> 0:18:58,295
It's Mr. Ross, sir, with Mr. Gray.


218
0:18:58,295 --> 0:19:0,197
Heavens, I must fly.


219
0:19:0,197 --> 0:19:3,133
The horses of Apollo are pawing
impatiently at the gates.


220
0:19:3,133 --> 0:19:4,735
I beg your pardon?


221
0:19:4,735 --> 0:19:9,84
Papa must go.


222
0:19:9,84 --> 0:19:12,643
You will come back
and finish the story?


223
0:19:12,643 --> 0:19:14,845
Of course I will.


224
0:19:14,845 --> 0:19:18,715
Come on, Cyril.
It's almost teatime.


225
0:19:18,715 --> 0:19:21,718
I really don't know why people bother
painting portraits anymore.


226
0:19:21,718 --> 0:19:26,56
You can get a much better likeness
with a photograph.


227
0:19:26,56 --> 0:19:28,325
A photograph's just
one moment in time...


228
0:19:28,325 --> 0:19:30,894
one gesture, one turn of the head.


229
0:19:30,894 --> 0:19:34,298
Yes, portraits are not
likenesses, Mr. Gray.


230
0:19:34,298 --> 0:19:37,501
Painters show the soul
of the subject, the essence.


231
0:19:37,501 --> 0:19:39,97
The essence of the sitter's
vanity, you mean.


232
0:19:39,97 --> 0:19:41,571
Well...


233
0:19:41,571 --> 0:19:46,61
this is a portrait
of Lady Battersby as a young woman.


234
0:19:46,61 --> 0:19:49,88
She's over there,
as a matter of fact.


235
0:19:49,88 --> 0:19:58,188
I must go and console her.


236
0:19:58,188 --> 0:20:0,59
How nice to see you.


237
0:20:0,59 --> 0:20:2,759
Poor thing.


238
0:20:2,759 --> 0:20:4,561
I expect in her heart...


239
0:20:4,561 --> 0:20:6,93
she thinks she still
looks like this.


240
0:20:6,93 --> 0:20:9,333
If we could look young
and innocent forever...


241
0:20:9,333 --> 0:20:12,235
Do you think we'd want to?


242
0:20:12,235 --> 0:20:14,438
If our souls were ugly, yes.


243
0:20:14,438 --> 0:20:20,911
Give a man a mask,
and he'll tell you the truth.


244
0:20:20,911 --> 0:21:3,754
Have we had enough of this?
Shall we go and have dinner somewhere?


245
0:21:3,754 --> 0:21:7,524
<i>Dorian Gray is the most
wonderful book I've ever read.</i>


246
0:21:7,524 --> 0:21:10,26
<i>And the end,
when the servants break in...</i>


247
0:21:10,26 --> 0:21:13,263
and they find him wizened,
old and dead...


248
0:21:13,263 --> 0:21:16,299
and the picture young again...


249
0:21:16,299 --> 0:21:18,402
I fainted.


250
0:21:18,402 --> 0:21:20,804
My family say it's dull and wicked.


251
0:21:20,804 --> 0:21:30,647
Dull?


252
0:21:30,647 --> 0:21:33,717
It's sublime.


253
0:21:33,717 --> 0:21:38,455
It's about the masks
we wear as faces...


254
0:21:38,455 --> 0:21:43,727
and the faces we wear as masks.


255
0:21:43,727 --> 0:21:46,463
That my son should have written
a work of such...


256
0:21:46,463 --> 0:21:50,901
People say it's full
of dangerous paradoxes.


257
0:21:50,901 --> 0:21:54,237
Hardly anyone will speak
to us anymore.


258
0:21:54,237 --> 0:21:59,743
We're ceasing to be respectable.


259
0:21:59,743 --> 0:22:4,748
Artists care nothing
about respectability.


260
0:22:4,748 --> 0:22:6,983
It's only jealousy.


261
0:22:6,983 --> 0:22:14,191
It's the spite of the untalented
for the men of genius.


262
0:22:14,191 --> 0:22:16,493
Where is Oscar?


263
0:22:16,493 --> 0:22:19,763
He's in the Lake District,
writing a play.


264
0:22:19,763 --> 0:22:23,233
- A drama?
- A comedy.


265
0:22:23,233 --> 0:22:27,471
Robbie Ross has gone
to keep him company.


266
0:22:27,471 --> 0:22:30,474
I do like Robbie.


267
0:22:30,474 --> 0:22:33,71
And they both love you.


268
0:22:33,71 --> 0:22:36,613
Oh, it'll be a great success.


269
0:22:36,613 --> 0:22:53,864
Oscar's made for the stage.


270
0:22:53,864 --> 0:23:4,574
- Author! Author!
- Author!


271
0:23:4,574 --> 0:23:6,743
Oscar, please!


272
0:23:6,743 --> 0:23:24,728
- Magnificent!
- Well done, everybody.


273
0:23:24,728 --> 0:23:29,199
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have enjoyed this evening immensely.


274
0:23:29,199 --> 0:23:33,837
The actors have given us a charming
rendering of a delightful play...


275
0:23:33,837 --> 0:23:37,307
and your appreciation
has been most intelligent.


276
0:23:37,307 --> 0:23:40,577
I congratulate you on the great success
of your performance...


277
0:23:40,577 --> 0:23:43,98
which persuades me that you think
almost as highly of this play...


278
0:23:43,98 --> 0:23:57,694
as I do myself.


279
0:23:57,694 --> 0:24:0,63
Absolutely splendid, Oscar.
An absolute triumph!


280
0:24:0,63 --> 0:24:3,133
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- Well done.


281
0:24:3,133 --> 0:24:6,369
How sweet of you to say so.


282
0:24:6,369 --> 0:24:9,773
It went so well, Oscar.


283
0:24:9,773 --> 0:24:12,108
Even better than I'd...


284
0:24:12,108 --> 0:24:14,811
They loved it.
They absolutely loved it.


285
0:24:14,811 --> 0:24:17,247
And I, dear boy, love you.


286
0:24:17,247 --> 0:24:18,982
Congratulations, Oscar.


287
0:24:18,982 --> 0:24:20,951
Thank you.


288
0:24:20,951 --> 0:24:22,819
It's good to see you.


289
0:24:22,819 --> 0:24:25,855
Hello.


290
0:24:25,855 --> 0:24:27,857
Mr. Wilde.
Wonderful, really wonderful.


291
0:24:27,857 --> 0:24:29,893
- Oscar.
- Sphinx!


292
0:24:29,893 --> 0:24:35,398
You really must be careful.
You're in grave danger of becoming rich.


293
0:24:35,398 --> 0:24:39,69
- It was wonderful. I knew it would be.
- Thank you, Robbie.


294
0:24:39,69 --> 0:24:41,738
Everyone's dying to know
who the real Lady Windermere is.


295
0:24:41,738 --> 0:24:44,641
The real Lady Windermere is every woman
in this room, and most of the men.


296
0:24:44,641 --> 0:24:46,142
- Oscar!
- Lionel!


297
0:24:46,142 --> 0:24:48,411
It's a wonderful play.


298
0:24:48,411 --> 0:24:50,413
My cousin Lord Alfred Douglas
is here.


299
0:24:50,413 --> 0:25:4,995
He would like very much
to congratulate you.


300
0:25:4,995 --> 0:25:7,631
- Wonderful.
- Oscar, this is Bosie Douglas.


301
0:25:7,631 --> 0:25:11,901
We met last year.
Lionel brought me to tea at Tite Street.


302
0:25:11,901 --> 0:25:17,44
How could I possibly forget?


303
0:25:17,44 --> 0:25:19,442
I love your play.


304
0:25:19,442 --> 0:25:21,578
The audience didn't know
whether you meant your jokes or not.


305
0:25:21,578 --> 0:25:23,546
You shocked them...


306
0:25:23,546 --> 0:25:26,316
especially with your speech.


307
0:25:26,316 --> 0:25:29,719
But the more frivolous you seem,
the more serious you are, aren't you?


308
0:25:29,719 --> 0:25:32,122
- I love that.
- Thank you.


309
0:25:32,122 --> 0:25:34,557
I always say,
the young are the only critics...


310
0:25:34,557 --> 0:25:36,693
with enough experience
to judge my work.


311
0:25:36,693 --> 0:25:39,396
- Splendid, Oscar.
- We need shocking.


312
0:25:39,396 --> 0:25:42,399
People are so banal.
And you use your wit like a foil.


313
0:25:42,399 --> 0:25:46,403
You cut through all those
starched shirt fronts.


314
0:25:46,403 --> 0:25:49,673
You draw blood.
It's magnificent.


315
0:25:49,673 --> 0:25:52,876
I wish you'd draw some blood
down in Oxford...


316
0:25:52,876 --> 0:25:54,544
though you'd need a miracle.


317
0:25:54,544 --> 0:25:57,47
All the dons at my college
have dust in their veins.


318
0:25:57,47 --> 0:26:0,917
At which college
do you educate the fellows?


319
0:26:0,917 --> 0:26:2,552
Magdalen.


320
0:26:2,552 --> 0:26:4,287
My own college.


321
0:26:4,287 --> 0:26:9,225
I shall claim the privilege of
a graduate and take tutorials with you.


322
0:26:9,225 --> 0:26:12,696
Come soon, then.
They're threatening to send me down.


323
0:26:12,696 --> 0:26:21,805
How could they be so cruel
to one so beautiful?


324
0:26:21,805 --> 0:26:24,974
Dons... they're so middle class.


325
0:26:24,974 --> 0:26:28,812
Oscar, you've shocked the whole
of London, smoking on stage like that.


326
0:26:28,812 --> 0:26:30,98
Excellent.
Then we shall run for a year.


327
0:26:30,98 --> 0:26:33,483
Oscar, you must say something
to Marion Terry.


328
0:26:33,483 --> 0:26:35,151
She was good, wasn't she?


329
0:26:35,151 --> 0:26:38,288
So good, I think she wrote
most of the lines herself.


330
0:26:38,288 --> 0:26:47,13
- Excuse me, Lord Alfred.
- Bosie, please.


331
0:26:47,13 --> 0:26:49,799
- You must be so thrilled, Oscar.
- I know.


332
0:26:49,799 --> 0:26:51,901
Isn't it humiliating?


333
0:26:51,901 --> 0:26:56,172
<i>" 'My own garden is my own garden, '
said the giant.</i>


334
0:26:56,172 --> 0:26:59,743
So he built a high wall
all round it...


335
0:26:59,743 --> 0:27:1,778
and put up a notice board:


336
0:27:1,778 --> 0:27:5,148
'Trespassers will be prosecuted.'


337
0:27:5,148 --> 0:27:8,551
He was a very selfish giant.


338
0:27:8,551 --> 0:27:11,821
The poor children
had now nowhere to play.


339
0:27:11,821 --> 0:27:13,823
They tried to play on the road...


340
0:27:13,823 --> 0:27:17,861
but the road was very dusty and full of
hard stones, and they did not like it.


341
0:27:17,861 --> 0:27:20,764
They used to wander round the high wall
when their lessons were over...


342
0:27:20,764 --> 0:27:24,667
<i>and talk about
the beautiful garden inside.</i>


343
0:27:24,667 --> 0:27:28,938
<i>'How happy we were there, '
they said to each other. "</i>


344
0:27:28,938 --> 0:27:32,542
I hope he was
a very beautiful boy.


345
0:27:32,542 --> 0:27:37,46
Well, pretty, you know,
in a street-Arab sort of way.


346
0:27:37,46 --> 0:27:46,89
There's no point being blackmailed
by an ugly one.


347
0:27:46,89 --> 0:27:50,126
What's tiresome is he's threatened
to show my letters to my father.


348
0:27:50,126 --> 0:27:55,999
Who will show them to all his friends
for the excellence of their style.


349
0:27:55,999 --> 0:27:59,869
You don't know him.
He's a brute.


350
0:27:59,869 --> 0:28:6,242
Really. He carries a whip
wherever he goes.


351
0:28:6,242 --> 0:28:9,445
He used to beat my mother.


352
0:28:9,445 --> 0:28:12,448
He beat my brothers.
He thrashed me from the age...


353
0:28:12,448 --> 0:28:16,92
My dear boy.


354
0:28:16,92 --> 0:28:21,9
Of course, he's
practically illiterate.


355
0:28:21,9 --> 0:28:23,526
He probably won't understand
the letters anyway.


356
0:28:23,526 --> 0:28:26,296
By an unforgivable oversight,
I've never been blackmailed myself...


357
0:28:26,296 --> 0:28:29,899
but my friends assure me that
a hundred pounds will usually suffice.


358
0:28:29,899 --> 0:28:31,401
Really?


359
0:28:31,401 --> 0:28:33,703
God, l... You promise?


360
0:28:33,703 --> 0:28:37,507
Leave it to Lewis...
George Lewis... my solicitor.


361
0:28:37,507 --> 0:28:49,252
He knows what he's doing.
He acts for the Prince of Wales.


362
0:28:49,252 --> 0:28:51,654
<i>Leave me not to pine</i>


363
0:28:51,654 --> 0:28:56,86
<i>Alone and desolate</i>


364
0:28:56,86 --> 0:29:1,264
<i>No fate seem fair as mine</i>


365
0:29:1,264 --> 0:29:5,568
<i>No happiness</i>


366
0:29:5,568 --> 0:29:7,503
<i>So great</i>


367
0:29:7,503 --> 0:29:9,439
Isn't he killing, Mr. Wilde?


368
0:29:9,439 --> 0:29:12,308
<i>- And nature day by day
- He's perfect.</i>


369
0:29:12,308 --> 0:29:15,411
He's perfect in every way.


370
0:29:15,411 --> 0:29:19,482
<i>In accents clear</i>


371
0:29:19,482 --> 0:29:25,21
<i>This joyous roundelay</i>


372
0:29:25,21 --> 0:29:28,625
<i>He loves me</i>


373
0:29:28,625 --> 0:29:38,568
<i>He is here</i>


374
0:29:38,568 --> 0:29:43,39
<i>He loves me</i>


375
0:29:43,39 --> 0:29:57,53
<i>He is here</i>


376
0:29:57,53 --> 0:29:59,222
That was lovely. Well done, Bosie.


377
0:29:59,222 --> 0:30:0,99
Yes, absolutely enchanting.


378
0:30:0,99 --> 0:31:28,111
More tea, anyone?


379
0:31:28,111 --> 0:31:31,28
I don't want to sit here.
I want to sit there.


380
0:31:31,28 --> 0:31:35,385
You heard what Lord Alfred said.


381
0:31:35,385 --> 0:31:37,62
I want everyone to look at us.


382
0:31:37,62 --> 0:31:50,233
I want everyone to say, "Look,
there's Oscar Wilde with his boy."


383
0:31:50,233 --> 0:31:54,637
So, what shall we let people
see us eating?


384
0:31:54,637 --> 0:31:57,974
Fois gras and lobster
and champagne.


385
0:31:57,974 --> 0:32:0,81
For two.
We do everything together.


386
0:32:0,81 --> 0:32:10,286
Very good, Mr. Wilde.


387
0:32:10,286 --> 0:32:13,99
I think he enjoyed thrashing me.


388
0:32:13,99 --> 0:32:17,86
All my family are mad.


389
0:32:17,86 --> 0:32:22,65
My uncle slit his throat last year
in a railway hotel.


390
0:32:22,65 --> 0:32:25,68
Which station?


391
0:32:25,68 --> 0:32:28,604
Euston.


392
0:32:28,604 --> 0:32:34,21
All life's really serious journeys
involve a railway terminus.


393
0:32:34,21 --> 0:32:38,81
And now I must go
to the station myself.


394
0:32:38,81 --> 0:32:41,551
Sarah Bernhardt thinks she knows
better than I do how to play Salome.


395
0:32:41,551 --> 0:32:44,654
Stay.


396
0:32:44,654 --> 0:32:48,224
Please stay.


397
0:32:48,224 --> 0:32:53,29
At least till this evening.


398
0:32:53,29 --> 0:32:56,466
Sarah is divine, as you are.


399
0:32:56,466 --> 0:33:0,57
She will be wonderful at the play's
climax when Salome kisses the lips...


400
0:33:0,57 --> 0:33:3,139
of the severed head
ofJohn the Baptist.


401
0:33:3,139 --> 0:33:6,709
"Ah, thou wouldst not suffer me
to kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan."


402
0:33:6,709 --> 0:33:9,745
Jokanaan is
an old Hebrew name forJohn.


403
0:33:9,745 --> 0:33:12,181
"Well, I will kiss it now.


404
0:33:12,181 --> 0:33:15,118
I will bite it with my teeth
as one bites a ripe fruit.


405
0:33:15,118 --> 0:33:20,123
Yes, I will kiss
thy mouth, Jokanaan.


406
0:33:20,123 --> 0:33:24,76
Thy body is white like the snows
that lie on the mountains...


407
0:33:24,76 --> 0:33:27,697
<i>like the snows that lie
on the mountains ofJudea...</i>


408
0:33:27,697 --> 0:33:30,666
<i>and come down into the valleys.</i>


409
0:33:30,666 --> 0:33:33,69
<i>The roses in the garden
of the queen of Arabia...</i>


410
0:33:33,69 --> 0:33:43,613
<i>are not so white as thy body. "</i>


411
0:33:43,613 --> 0:33:48,451
<i>I'm not good enough
for him anymore.</i>


412
0:33:48,451 --> 0:33:50,786
I'm just the son
of a carpenter, while Bosie...


413
0:33:50,786 --> 0:33:55,625
Oscar's only ever
been smitten before.


414
0:33:55,625 --> 0:33:59,228
He was smitten with me.
He was smitten with you.


415
0:33:59,228 --> 0:34:6,602
I wasn't smitten.


416
0:34:6,602 --> 0:34:8,104
I loved him.


417
0:34:8,104 --> 0:34:13,776
Well, now he's fallen in love.


418
0:34:13,776 --> 0:34:18,314
I'm halfway to hellfire.
I'm not joking.


419
0:34:18,314 --> 0:34:23,186
Someone else was
a carpenter's son.


420
0:34:23,186 --> 0:34:27,89
I've given in
and become a Catholic.


421
0:34:27,89 --> 0:34:29,859
I find confession...


422
0:34:29,859 --> 0:34:31,46
wonderfully consoling.


423
0:34:31,46 --> 0:34:34,463
I can't go to confession...


424
0:34:34,463 --> 0:34:39,569
when I want to kill Bosie...


425
0:34:39,569 --> 0:34:49,512
or myself.


426
0:34:49,512 --> 0:34:52,448
- Oscar's furious.
- He has no right to be.


427
0:34:52,448 --> 0:34:55,218
He knew perfectly well the Lord
Chamberlain would never allow...


428
0:34:55,218 --> 0:34:57,22
a play with biblical characters.


429
0:34:57,22 --> 0:34:59,855
Oscar doesn't think there should be
censorship of plays at all.


430
0:34:59,855 --> 0:35:1,958
Of course there
must be censorship.


431
0:35:1,958 --> 0:35:5,461
Or people would say what they meant,
and then where should we be?


432
0:35:5,461 --> 0:35:8,64
- When is he coming to join us?
- He's not.


433
0:35:8,64 --> 0:35:10,266
He must stay
and look after Lord Alfred.


434
0:35:10,266 --> 0:35:13,603
Those Douglases are always ill,
when they're not demented.


435
0:35:13,603 --> 0:35:15,972
One of them roasted
a kitchen boy on a spit.


436
0:35:15,972 --> 0:35:18,507
And Bosie's father,
Lord Queensberry...


437
0:35:18,507 --> 0:35:21,11
he's a dreadful man, Constance...


438
0:35:21,11 --> 0:35:23,779
eoesn't believe in God
or marriage.


439
0:35:23,779 --> 0:35:26,349
A marquis should set
a proper example...


440
0:35:26,349 --> 0:35:29,552
or what are the upper classes for?


441
0:35:29,552 --> 0:35:31,52
I tell you...


442
0:35:31,52 --> 0:35:37,56
I wouldn't want a daughter of mine
to marry a Douglas.


443
0:35:37,56 --> 0:35:39,262
I haven't got a daughter.


444
0:35:39,262 --> 0:35:48,471
Plenty of time still, my dear.


445
0:35:48,471 --> 0:35:51,374
I see.


446
0:35:51,374 --> 0:35:54,477
It's my fault.


447
0:35:54,477 --> 0:36:0,616
After Vyvyan was born,
all I could think of was the children.


448
0:36:0,616 --> 0:36:4,587
So that's why Oscar spends
so much time with his men friends.


449
0:36:4,587 --> 0:36:7,29
Oscar needs disciples.


450
0:36:7,29 --> 0:36:10,593
Lord Alfred's a poet.
A very fine poet, Oscar says.


451
0:36:10,593 --> 0:36:17,166
He's studying classics.
Oscar and he talk about Plato.


452
0:36:17,166 --> 0:36:19,835
There's nothing wrong.


453
0:36:19,835 --> 0:36:21,671
Really, there isn't.


454
0:36:21,671 --> 0:36:23,973
It's not whether
there is anything wrong.


455
0:36:23,973 --> 0:36:26,942
It's whether or not
there appears to be.


456
0:36:26,942 --> 0:36:28,944
That's all people care about.


457
0:36:28,944 --> 0:36:34,75
The empire was not built
by men like Bosie Douglas.


458
0:36:34,75 --> 0:36:38,187
<i>"Then the spring came...</i>


459
0:36:38,187 --> 0:36:41,857
<i>only in the garden of the selfish giant
it was still winter.</i>


460
0:36:41,857 --> 0:36:44,96
<i>The birds did not care to sing in it,
as there were no children.</i>


461
0:36:44,96 --> 0:36:47,563
<i>And the trees forgot to blossom.</i>


462
0:36:47,563 --> 0:36:50,766
<i>The snow covered up the grass
with her great white cloak...</i>


463
0:36:50,766 --> 0:37:47,256
<i>and the frost painted
all the trees silver. "</i>


464
0:37:47,256 --> 0:37:48,958
Let's go out.


465
0:37:48,958 --> 0:37:55,398
If you like.


466
0:37:55,398 --> 0:37:58,868
The thing about renters is you
don't have to consider their feelings.


467
0:37:58,868 --> 0:38:2,204
But if someone is willing to give one
pleasure, one should show gratitude.


468
0:38:2,204 --> 0:38:5,441
No. Money, that's all they want.


469
0:38:5,441 --> 0:38:9,845
What's wonderful about going
to Taylor's is no one pretends.


470
0:38:9,845 --> 0:38:19,855
You just do it
and be done with it.


471
0:38:19,855 --> 0:38:23,759
I do love you, Oscar.


472
0:38:23,759 --> 0:38:30,366
But variety is
the spice of life.


473
0:38:30,366 --> 0:38:34,57
You can watch me, if you like.


474
0:38:34,57 --> 0:38:38,641
<i>You must attempt to keep a grasp
upon your sobriety.</i>


475
0:38:38,641 --> 0:38:42,311
That is disgusting.
We'll have less of that.


476
0:38:42,311 --> 0:38:44,713
- Good evening.
- Lord Alfred.


477
0:38:44,713 --> 0:38:46,549
Alfred Taylor, this is Oscar.


478
0:38:46,549 --> 0:38:49,385
Delighted to make
your acquaintance, Oscar.


479
0:38:49,385 --> 0:38:52,455
Charles Parker. I remember you.


480
0:38:52,455 --> 0:38:54,99
Hello, Oscar.


481
0:38:54,99 --> 0:39:1,931
Charming to see you again.


482
0:39:1,931 --> 0:39:3,966
- Do you smoke?
- I do everything.


483
0:39:3,966 --> 0:39:10,306
- Yeah, everything that pays.
- Expertly, I might add.


484
0:39:10,306 --> 0:39:12,174
Mr. Wilde, some wine.


485
0:39:12,174 --> 0:39:14,176
Thank you.


486
0:39:14,176 --> 0:39:20,149
- It's a nice case.
- I want you to keep it.


487
0:39:20,149 --> 0:39:22,518
Thank you.


488
0:39:22,518 --> 0:39:26,889
So, this is a den of vice.
I should call it more of a garden.


489
0:39:26,889 --> 0:39:29,258
Such pretty flowers, Mr. Taylor.


490
0:39:29,258 --> 0:39:31,894
How wise of you to keep
the curtains closed.


491
0:39:31,894 --> 0:39:33,896
They would never grow
in the common light of day.


492
0:39:33,896 --> 0:39:36,899
- Who are you calling common?
- Certainly not you, dear boy.


493
0:39:36,899 --> 0:39:49,211
You seem to be a flower
of the rarest hue.


494
0:39:49,211 --> 0:39:52,982
Bosie never told me that you
were a botanist, Mr. Taylor...


495
0:39:52,982 --> 0:39:56,151
that you roam the earth, climbing
the highest peaks of the Himalayas...


496
0:39:56,151 --> 0:39:58,454
and plunging
into the darkest forests...


497
0:39:58,454 --> 0:40:1,557
of Borneo to return triumphant...


498
0:40:1,557 --> 0:40:4,593
to this delightful conservatory
in the shadow of Westminster Abbey...


499
0:40:4,593 --> 0:40:7,596
to exhibit your specimens.


500
0:40:7,596 --> 0:40:10,766
The boys are all Londoners, actually.


501
0:40:10,766 --> 0:40:13,335
Impossible.
I see Londoners every day...


502
0:40:13,335 --> 0:40:16,906
but never such
exotic blooms as these.


503
0:40:16,906 --> 0:40:19,141
Does he always talk like this?


504
0:40:19,141 --> 0:40:31,32
Not when he's in bed.


505
0:40:31,32 --> 0:40:33,155
<i>I am discreet.</i>


506
0:40:33,155 --> 0:40:38,16
<i>Bosie is far too grand for that.
He wants everyone to know.</i>


507
0:40:38,16 --> 0:40:41,163
- You must understand...
- I must be with young people, Robbie.


508
0:40:41,163 --> 0:40:43,832
They're so frank and free.


509
0:40:43,832 --> 0:40:45,834
They make me feel young myself.


510
0:40:45,834 --> 0:40:48,203
That's all very well,
but what would you say...


511
0:40:48,203 --> 0:40:51,206
if someone wanted
to go to bed with your son?


512
0:40:51,206 --> 0:40:52,708
Cyril's eight.


513
0:40:52,708 --> 0:40:58,48
What will you say when he's 18?


514
0:40:58,48 --> 0:41:2,117
Nothing. He must do
as his nature dictates...


515
0:41:2,117 --> 0:41:4,887
<i>as I only wish I had done.</i>


516
0:41:4,887 --> 0:41:8,591
"'I do believe the spring has come
at last,' said the giant.


517
0:41:8,591 --> 0:41:11,594
He jumped out of bed,
and looked out of the window."


518
0:41:11,594 --> 0:41:14,29
- What did he see?
- You tell me.


519
0:41:14,29 --> 0:41:15,698
No, you tell it.


520
0:41:15,698 --> 0:41:19,835
All right.
"He saw the most wonderful sight.


521
0:41:19,835 --> 0:41:21,971
Through a little hole
in the wall...


522
0:41:21,971 --> 0:41:24,607
the children had crept back
into the garden and were sitting...


523
0:41:24,607 --> 0:41:26,609
on the branches of the trees.


524
0:41:26,609 --> 0:41:29,878
And every tree that he could see,
there was a little child.


525
0:41:29,878 --> 0:41:31,88
The trees were so glad that they..."


526
0:41:31,88 --> 0:41:33,716
They covered themselves
with blossoms!


527
0:41:33,716 --> 0:41:35,15
Blossoms!


528
0:41:35,15 --> 0:41:38,887
"And were waving their arms gently
above the children's heads.


529
0:41:38,887 --> 0:41:42,725
And the birds were twittering
and singing above them with delight.


530
0:41:42,725 --> 0:41:46,729
And the flowers were looking up
through the grass and laughing.


531
0:41:46,729 --> 0:41:50,866
Oscar, it's time the boys changed,
or we'll miss the train.


532
0:41:50,866 --> 0:41:52,935
Come on, boys.


533
0:41:52,935 --> 0:41:55,27
Papa, can't we stay?


534
0:41:55,27 --> 0:41:59,108
Papa's got to work.
He's got to finish his play.


535
0:41:59,108 --> 0:42:0,776
Yes, poor dear Papa.


536
0:42:0,776 --> 0:42:3,45
Poor Papa.


537
0:42:3,45 --> 0:42:9,718
Poor, poor, poor, poor, poor Papa.


538
0:42:9,718 --> 0:42:12,21
<i>Where is Oscar?
We haven't seen him at all.</i>


539
0:42:12,21 --> 0:42:15,9
Where do you think he is? He's working.
He is a writer, after all.


540
0:42:15,9 --> 0:42:17,926
I hear your father's threatening
to shoot Lord Roseberry.


541
0:42:17,926 --> 0:42:21,764
Really? He usually
prefers the horsewhip.


542
0:42:21,764 --> 0:42:23,999
Says he's been buggering
your brother.


543
0:42:23,999 --> 0:42:27,2
Well, Roseberry is Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs...


544
0:42:27,2 --> 0:42:29,605
and Francis is
his private secretary.


545
0:42:29,605 --> 0:42:32,174
Actually, Francis is
about to get engaged.


546
0:42:32,174 --> 0:42:36,779
What's your father
talking about, then?


547
0:42:36,779 --> 0:42:38,947
He's obsessed with sex.


548
0:42:38,947 --> 0:42:40,983
He thinks Oscar's buggering me...


549
0:42:40,983 --> 0:42:55,497
as though I'd allow
anyone to do that.


550
0:42:55,497 --> 0:43:1,3
I'm sick of the country.


551
0:43:1,3 --> 0:43:8,711
Let's get back to London.


552
0:43:8,711 --> 0:43:11,647
What's the point of us living together
if you're always working?


553
0:43:11,647 --> 0:43:17,72
- I have responsibilities... a family.
- God, not that again!


554
0:43:17,72 --> 0:43:25,594
I ask my friends over from Oxford,
and you just disappear.


555
0:43:25,594 --> 0:43:28,397
I'd be better off
staying at my mother's.


556
0:43:28,397 --> 0:43:31,734
- At least she's there.
- You asked me to take this house...


557
0:43:31,734 --> 0:43:33,435
Now I'm bored with it.


558
0:43:33,435 --> 0:43:37,139
- And with you.
- I can't give it up.


559
0:43:37,139 --> 0:43:42,144
It's paid for in advance.
Until I finish my new...


560
0:43:42,144 --> 0:43:43,645
Bosie, dear...


561
0:43:43,645 --> 0:43:46,14
you have beauty,
you have breeding...


562
0:43:46,14 --> 0:43:48,751
and, most glorious of all,
you have youth.


563
0:43:48,751 --> 0:43:51,386
But you are very fantastical
if you think that pleasures...


564
0:43:51,386 --> 0:43:54,56
don't have to be earned
and paid for.


565
0:43:54,56 --> 0:43:58,6
Whenever I want to do anything,
you say you can't afford it...


566
0:43:58,6 --> 0:44:0,496
but you give all those renters
cigarette cases.


567
0:44:0,496 --> 0:44:2,765
But I've lavished presents on you!


568
0:44:2,765 --> 0:44:5,667
Every penny I've earned from my play
I have spent on you!


569
0:44:5,667 --> 0:44:8,47
I'm sure you've been counting.


570
0:44:8,47 --> 0:44:11,707
You're so mean
and penny-pinching...


571
0:44:11,707 --> 0:44:14,409
and middle-class, all you can
think about is your bank balance.


572
0:44:14,409 --> 0:44:16,512
For God's sake!
This is intolerable!


573
0:44:16,512 --> 0:44:22,651
No gentleman ever has the slightest idea
what his bank balance is!


574
0:44:22,651 --> 0:44:24,419
You're absurd!


575
0:44:24,419 --> 0:44:26,789
Telling everyone
how they ought to live.


576
0:44:26,789 --> 0:44:29,591
You're so vulgar!


577
0:44:29,591 --> 0:44:32,261
I never want
to see you again, ever.


578
0:44:32,261 --> 0:44:35,964
All right, then.
If that's what you want, then you go!


579
0:44:35,964 --> 0:44:41,37
Get out!


580
0:44:41,37 --> 0:44:43,939
<i>"But in the farthest corner
of the garden...</i>


581
0:44:43,939 --> 0:44:48,377
<i>it was still winter, and in it
was standing a little boy.</i>


582
0:44:48,377 --> 0:44:52,714
<i>He was so small, he could not reach up
to the branches of the tree.</i>


583
0:44:52,714 --> 0:44:55,818
<i>'Climb up, little boy, '
said the tree.</i>


584
0:44:55,818 --> 0:44:59,254
<i>But the little boy was too tiny. "</i>


585
0:44:59,254 --> 0:45:2,9
Egypt is lovely this time of year.


586
0:45:2,9 --> 0:45:5,527
- But you mustn't idle your time away.
- Mother.


587
0:45:5,527 --> 0:45:10,65
And I want you
to promise me something:


588
0:45:10,65 --> 0:45:13,635
Not to write to Oscar Wilde.


589
0:45:13,635 --> 0:45:17,639
I can't do that.
I love Oscar.


590
0:45:17,639 --> 0:45:20,375
I love him as a disciple
loves his teacher.


591
0:45:20,375 --> 0:45:23,912
But he's not fit to teach anything.
He's evil.


592
0:45:23,912 --> 0:45:28,15
Do you really think your own son
could love someone evil?


593
0:45:28,15 --> 0:45:31,653
I just wish I could love Oscar
as loyally, devotedly...


594
0:45:31,653 --> 0:45:37,192
unselfishly and purely
as he loves me.


595
0:45:37,192 --> 0:45:41,797
But I'm not as good as he is.


596
0:45:41,797 --> 0:45:46,168
I probably never will be.


597
0:45:46,168 --> 0:46:3,352
Good-bye, then.


598
0:46:3,352 --> 0:46:5,487
<i>"I adore simple pleasures.</i>


599
0:46:5,487 --> 0:46:8,423
<i>They are the last refuge
of the complex.</i>


600
0:46:8,423 --> 0:46:10,993
But, if you wish,
let us stay here.


601
0:46:10,993 --> 0:46:13,61
Yes, let us stay here.


602
0:46:13,61 --> 0:46:16,665
<i>The Book of Life begins
with a man and a woman in a garden."</i>


603
0:46:16,665 --> 0:46:18,667
"It ends with 'Revelations."'


604
0:46:18,667 --> 0:46:21,47
Yes. Mr. Tree, may I?


605
0:46:21,47 --> 0:46:24,139
I'm delighted, of course,
that you find my lines funny...


606
0:46:24,139 --> 0:46:26,675
but please don't try and make
the audience laugh with them.


607
0:46:26,675 --> 0:46:29,511
They should sound completely
spontaneous and natural...


608
0:46:29,511 --> 0:46:31,713
as though people spoke
like that all the time.


609
0:46:31,713 --> 0:46:34,182
Yes, of course.


610
0:46:34,182 --> 0:46:37,319
Let's try again.


611
0:46:37,319 --> 0:46:39,922
You should break with Bosie
more often, Oscar.


612
0:46:39,922 --> 0:46:44,293
Then we'd have more of
your spontaneous and natural plays.


613
0:46:44,293 --> 0:46:47,362
Bosie was envious.
That's why he stopped Oscar working.


614
0:46:47,362 --> 0:46:49,698
- That's not true.
- Of course it is.


615
0:46:49,698 --> 0:46:52,868
His poems aren't nearly
as good as you pretend...


616
0:46:52,868 --> 0:46:54,503
and he knows it.


617
0:46:54,503 --> 0:47:0,8
- He's just a shallow little...
- Rivulet.


618
0:47:0,8 --> 0:47:3,612
Bosie's a child, a vulnerable child.
He needs love.


619
0:47:3,612 --> 0:47:6,548
We all need love.


620
0:47:6,548 --> 0:47:8,717
But which of us can give it?


621
0:47:8,717 --> 0:47:11,553
<i>Wish you a merry Christmas</i>


622
0:47:11,553 --> 0:47:16,792
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas</i>


623
0:47:16,792 --> 0:47:19,361
<i>And a happy New Year</i>


624
0:47:19,361 --> 0:47:22,64
<i>Good tidings we bring</i>


625
0:47:22,64 --> 0:47:24,666
<i>To you and your kin</i>


626
0:47:24,666 --> 0:47:27,235
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas</i>


627
0:47:27,235 --> 0:47:30,739
<i>And a happy New Year</i>


628
0:47:30,739 --> 0:47:33,241
- Cracker time!
- It is cracker time.


629
0:47:33,241 --> 0:47:36,178
I won this time. Look. There.
One for you, one for me.


630
0:47:36,178 --> 0:47:39,781
<i>"And the giant's heart melted
as he looked out.</i>


631
0:47:39,781 --> 0:47:43,18
<i>'How selfish I have been, '
he said.</i>


632
0:47:43,18 --> 0:47:46,221
<i>'Now I know why the spring
would not come here.</i>


633
0:47:46,221 --> 0:47:48,991
<i>I will put that little boy
on top of the tree...</i>


634
0:47:48,991 --> 0:47:51,226
<i>and I will knock down the wall,
and my garden shall be...</i>


635
0:47:51,226 --> 0:47:54,62
<i>the children's playground
forever and ever. '</i>


636
0:47:54,62 --> 0:47:58,233
<i>He was really very sorry
for what he had done. "</i>


637
0:47:58,233 --> 0:48:1,603
This is really nice, even though...


638
0:48:1,603 --> 0:48:5,34
<i>"So he crept downstairs and opened
the front door quite softly...</i>


639
0:48:5,34 --> 0:48:11,46
<i>and went out into the garden.</i>


640
0:48:11,46 --> 0:48:14,16
<i>That he did not see
the giant coming.</i>


641
0:48:14,16 --> 0:48:18,453
<i>And the giant stole up behind him
and took him gently by the hand...</i>


642
0:48:18,453 --> 0:48:20,622
<i>and put him up into the tree.</i>


643
0:48:20,622 --> 0:48:22,724
<i>And the tree broke
at once into blossom...</i>


644
0:48:22,724 --> 0:48:25,494
<i>and the birds came and sang on it,
and the little boy...</i>


645
0:48:25,494 --> 0:48:27,596
<i>stretched out his two arms...</i>


646
0:48:27,596 --> 0:48:30,32
<i>and flung them
round the giant's neck...</i>


647
0:48:30,32 --> 0:49:5,167
<i>and kissed him. "</i>


648
0:49:5,167 --> 0:49:8,17
I don't care what people think.
I love you.


649
0:49:8,17 --> 0:49:11,74
It's all that matters to me.
It was agony being away from you.


650
0:49:11,74 --> 0:49:13,642
Well, here I am.


651
0:49:13,642 --> 0:49:16,11
Oh, Bosie, you're
my catastrophe, my doom.


652
0:49:16,11 --> 0:49:19,448
Everyone says so, even me.


653
0:49:19,448 --> 0:49:23,218
I missed you.


654
0:49:23,218 --> 0:49:33,395
I thought you might like something
to celebrate your return.


655
0:49:33,395 --> 0:49:36,398
When I saw them in the window,
they begged me on their knees...


656
0:49:36,398 --> 0:49:39,568
to make them yours.


657
0:49:39,568 --> 0:49:57,953
I'll put them on now.
They're superb.


658
0:49:57,953 --> 0:50:1,56
- I'll sit there. I want a proper table.
- Is there something wrong, my lord?


659
0:50:1,56 --> 0:50:4,25
This young fool wants me
to sit by the service door.


660
0:50:4,25 --> 0:50:6,128
Oh, God, my father.


661
0:50:6,128 --> 0:50:11,5
I'm extremely sorry. He's new,
and he didn't know who you were.


662
0:50:11,5 --> 0:50:19,474
Bosie, you're not going to flee.


663
0:50:19,474 --> 0:50:25,547
Give me the menu.


664
0:50:25,547 --> 0:50:28,15
I'll have the pea soup
and then the salmon.


665
0:50:28,15 --> 0:50:32,2
Will you have it with us, Papa?


666
0:50:32,2 --> 0:50:40,295
I'm lunching with Oscar Wilde.
Will you join us?


667
0:50:40,295 --> 0:50:42,731
I told you never to see
that vile cur again.


668
0:50:42,731 --> 0:50:48,803
He's not vile or a cur.
He's utterly delightful. Come and see.


669
0:50:48,803 --> 0:50:53,108
How do you know what he's like
when you've never met him?


670
0:50:53,108 --> 0:51:4,653
You're not a man to be influenced
by other people's opinions.


671
0:51:4,653 --> 0:51:8,723
Oscar, you've never met
my father, have you?


672
0:51:8,723 --> 0:51:13,528
Lord Queensberry.


673
0:51:13,528 --> 0:51:19,267
Bosie has told me so much about
your exploits on the racetrack.


674
0:51:19,267 --> 0:51:23,838
I've never heard such bad luck
as yours with the Grand National.


675
0:51:23,838 --> 0:51:26,208
Bosie tells me
that you would have won...


676
0:51:26,208 --> 0:51:30,212
but that your cousin
wouldn't let you ride the horse?


677
0:51:30,212 --> 0:51:33,348
Bloody fool said I was too old.


678
0:51:33,348 --> 0:51:37,519
Why, you're never too old.
I'd ridden Old Joe on the gallops.


679
0:51:37,519 --> 0:51:39,554
Came in at 40 to 1.


680
0:51:39,554 --> 0:51:42,23
No horse could ever have carried me
over the jumps, I fear.


681
0:51:42,23 --> 0:51:44,693
What are you having?


682
0:51:44,693 --> 0:51:47,462
- Pea soup and salmon.
- Then I shall join you.


683
0:51:47,462 --> 0:51:49,798
Spring is the time
to lunch on salmon...


684
0:51:49,798 --> 0:51:53,702
though I always think it tastes so much
nicer if you've caught it yourself.


685
0:51:53,702 --> 0:51:55,237
You fish?


686
0:51:55,237 --> 0:51:57,372
I used to when I lived in Ireland.


687
0:51:57,372 --> 0:51:59,774
My father had the most charming
hunting lodge...


688
0:51:59,774 --> 0:52:2,11
on an island in a lake.


689
0:52:2,11 --> 0:52:9,284
- Do you know the west of Ireland?
- Not really.


690
0:52:9,284 --> 0:52:25,5
Whereabouts, exactly?


691
0:52:25,5 --> 0:52:28,97
The Christians go around pretending
they know who God is and how He works.


692
0:52:28,97 --> 0:52:31,6
I've got no time for that tomfoolery.


693
0:52:31,6 --> 0:52:34,9
If you don't know something,
you should stand up and say so...


694
0:52:34,9 --> 0:52:37,912
not go around pretending
you believe in some mumbo jumbo.


695
0:52:37,912 --> 0:52:40,949
I can believe in anything,
provided it's incredible.


696
0:52:40,949 --> 0:52:44,185
That's why I intend to die a Catholic,
though I couldn't possibly live as one.


697
0:52:44,185 --> 0:52:49,391
Catholicism is such a romantic religion.
It has saints and sinners.


698
0:52:49,391 --> 0:52:51,893
The Church of England
only has respectable people...


699
0:52:51,893 --> 0:52:54,396
who believe in respectability.


700
0:52:54,396 --> 0:52:58,9
You get to be a bishop not by what
you believe but by what you don't.


701
0:52:58,9 --> 0:53:0,669
That's true enough.


702
0:53:0,669 --> 0:53:3,305
It's the only church where
the skeptic stands at the altar...


703
0:53:3,305 --> 0:53:6,308
and St. Thomas the Doubter
is prince of the apostles.


704
0:53:6,308 --> 0:53:10,912
No, I couldn't possibly die
in the Church of England.


705
0:53:10,912 --> 0:53:13,581
Where do you stand on cremation?


706
0:53:13,581 --> 0:53:18,86
I'm not sure I have a position.


707
0:53:18,86 --> 0:53:20,588
I'm for it.


708
0:53:20,588 --> 0:53:22,791
I wrote a poem:


709
0:53:22,791 --> 0:53:26,94
"When I am dead, cremate me."


710
0:53:26,94 --> 0:53:28,43
That's how it begins.


711
0:53:28,43 --> 0:53:31,633
"When I am dead, cremate me."


712
0:53:31,633 --> 0:53:35,637
What do you think of that
for an opening line?


713
0:53:35,637 --> 0:53:37,138
It's challenging.


714
0:53:37,138 --> 0:53:39,474
I'm a challenging sort of man.


715
0:53:39,474 --> 0:53:41,643
That's why people don't like me.


716
0:53:41,643 --> 0:53:44,479
I don't go along with
the ordinary ways of thinking.


717
0:53:44,479 --> 0:53:47,349
Then we are exactly alike.


718
0:53:47,349 --> 0:53:49,984
Another glass of brandy?


719
0:53:49,984 --> 0:53:52,987
I find that alcohol,
taken in sufficient quantities...


720
0:53:52,987 --> 0:53:57,125
can produce all the effects
of drunkenness.


721
0:53:57,125 --> 0:53:59,561
You were there for ages.


722
0:53:59,561 --> 0:54:3,565
You stayed talking till after 4:00.
I knew you'd like him.


723
0:54:3,565 --> 0:54:6,501
Well, he's got charm,
I admit that.


724
0:54:6,501 --> 0:54:8,2
But that's bad.


725
0:54:8,2 --> 0:54:10,372
Men shouldn't be charming.


726
0:54:10,372 --> 0:54:12,907
It's disgusting.
I don't think much of his action.


727
0:54:12,907 --> 0:54:15,844
Let's have a look at the bay.


728
0:54:15,844 --> 0:54:18,12
Mind you, Wilde's no fool.


729
0:54:18,12 --> 0:54:20,749
Talks wonderfully,
really wonderfully.


730
0:54:20,749 --> 0:54:24,386
But that means nothing
when what he says is such rot.


731
0:54:24,386 --> 0:54:27,188
Worse than rot... evil.


732
0:54:27,188 --> 0:54:29,958
Which is why I insist
you stop seeing him forthwith.


733
0:54:29,958 --> 0:54:31,96
"Insist"?
What's that supposed to mean?


734
0:54:31,96 --> 0:54:36,197
It means I will cut off your allowance
if you don't do as I say.


735
0:54:36,197 --> 0:54:39,501
- Trot him up and down a bit!
- Look, Father.


736
0:54:39,501 --> 0:54:42,771
You wasted time at Oxford pretending
you were going into the Foreign Office.


737
0:54:42,771 --> 0:54:45,106
Thank God you didn't
when thatJew queer Roseberry...


738
0:54:45,106 --> 0:54:48,109
can become Foreign Secretary and bugger
all the juniors, including your brother.


739
0:54:48,109 --> 0:54:49,677
That's all lies.


740
0:54:49,677 --> 0:54:52,18
You spent your whole time
writing obscene poetry.


741
0:54:52,18 --> 0:54:53,782
My poems aren't obscene.


742
0:54:53,782 --> 0:54:56,785
They're in the manner of Wilde.
That's filthy enough for me.


743
0:54:56,785 --> 0:54:59,421
Have you ever actually read
any of Oscar's poems?


744
0:54:59,421 --> 0:55:3,458
I wouldn't sully my mind
with perverted trash like that.


745
0:55:3,458 --> 0:55:5,46
Tell him to pick his feet up!


746
0:55:5,46 --> 0:55:7,662
He's not straight!


747
0:55:7,662 --> 0:55:9,998
Are you calling Oscar a pervert?


748
0:55:9,998 --> 0:55:11,566
Because that's libelous.


749
0:55:11,566 --> 0:55:15,69
I'm not saying he is one.
I'm saying he's posing as one...


750
0:55:15,69 --> 0:55:17,439
which is worse.


751
0:55:17,439 --> 0:55:19,474
His wife's divorcing him.


752
0:55:19,474 --> 0:55:23,378
Did you know that?
For sodomy!


753
0:55:23,378 --> 0:55:26,381
- That's completely untrue!
- I hope it is.


754
0:55:26,381 --> 0:55:32,821
Because if it were true,
I'd shoot him on sight.


755
0:55:32,821 --> 0:55:38,76
You will cease to see Wilde,
or I'll cut you off without a penny.


756
0:55:38,76 --> 0:55:40,929
As though I wanted your money...


757
0:55:40,929 --> 0:55:44,265
what little you have left
from your tarts.


758
0:55:44,265 --> 0:55:47,368
How dare you speak
to your father like that.


759
0:55:47,368 --> 0:55:51,272
What a funny little man you are.


760
0:55:51,272 --> 0:55:54,375
Come back here,
you filthy-minded sissy!


761
0:55:54,375 --> 0:55:56,11
You're absurd!


762
0:55:56,11 --> 0:55:58,913
And you're nothing but a bum-boy!


763
0:55:58,913 --> 0:56:4,352
You're pathetic!


764
0:56:4,352 --> 0:56:6,688
I'm a bloody good shot.
Better than he is.


765
0:56:6,688 --> 0:56:8,923
I'll shoot him through the heart
if he threatens me.


766
0:56:8,923 --> 0:56:11,226
Hadn't you better use
a silver bullet then?


767
0:56:11,226 --> 0:56:13,228
Here's one for the Black Douglas.


768
0:56:13,228 --> 0:56:15,43
Bosie, for God's sake!


769
0:56:15,43 --> 0:56:17,232
And one for his liver!
One for his lights!


770
0:56:17,232 --> 0:56:23,438
One for his stinking rotten soul!


771
0:56:23,438 --> 0:56:26,274
I'll save one for myself.


772
0:56:26,274 --> 0:56:45,193
My own father...
he wants to kill me.


773
0:56:45,193 --> 0:56:48,997
My life is everything
I ever wanted.


774
0:56:48,997 --> 0:56:52,166
I have fame.


775
0:56:52,166 --> 0:56:54,869
I have recognition.


776
0:56:54,869 --> 0:56:57,972
With two plays
about to open in London...


777
0:56:57,972 --> 0:57:1,175
I may even have money.


778
0:57:1,175 --> 0:57:5,13
The world is at my command...


779
0:57:5,13 --> 0:57:9,551
yet I can't command myself.


780
0:57:9,551 --> 0:57:25,733
I can't command
my feelings for you.


781
0:57:25,733 --> 0:57:28,836
<i>- Thank you.
- Constance, my dear.</i>


782
0:57:28,836 --> 0:57:40,48
How nice.


783
0:57:40,48 --> 0:57:43,451
I brought you your letters.


784
0:57:43,451 --> 0:57:46,721
You haven't been home
for so long.


785
0:57:46,721 --> 0:57:53,127
Thank you.


786
0:57:53,127 --> 0:57:55,797
It's so much more convenient
for Oscar living in the West End...


787
0:57:55,797 --> 0:57:58,66
when he has a play coming on.


788
0:57:58,66 --> 0:58:1,97
I'm like a northern businessman
keeping an eye on his factory.


789
0:58:1,97 --> 0:58:4,305
The boys ask for you
all the time.


790
0:58:4,305 --> 0:58:7,141
They're longing to see you.


791
0:58:7,141 --> 0:58:10,445
Oscar has to make sure
the play's a success, Constance.


792
0:58:10,445 --> 0:58:12,213
I'll come round this afternoon...


793
0:58:12,213 --> 0:58:16,184
for tea.


794
0:58:16,184 --> 0:58:22,757
It's the dress rehearsal
this afternoon.


795
0:58:22,757 --> 0:58:24,726
Tomorrow then.
I'll come tomorrow.


796
0:58:24,726 --> 0:58:34,268
Well, tomorrow then.


797
0:58:34,268 --> 0:58:37,372
Good-bye, my dear.


798
0:58:37,372 --> 0:58:45,647
Good-bye.


799
0:58:45,647 --> 0:58:57,392
Good-bye, Constance.


800
0:58:57,392 --> 0:58:59,861
- Something like that.
- I'm not trying to get anything.


801
0:58:59,861 --> 0:59:3,931
I hope so. It would be rather fun.
Perhaps a codfish.


802
0:59:3,931 --> 0:59:6,901
Codfish. I've a strong feeling
that codfish live rather deeper.


803
0:59:6,901 --> 0:59:13,808
- Do you think we'll have skate...
- Possibly.


804
0:59:13,808 --> 0:59:18,413
I don't think there'll be anything
for our table tonight, my love. No luck.


805
0:59:18,413 --> 0:59:20,782
I think I'd better stay.
You're getting a cold.


806
0:59:20,782 --> 0:59:24,986
No, no. I'm all right.
Let's get the boys some ices.


807
0:59:24,986 --> 0:59:29,323
- Boys, you stay and look after nanny.
- Oh, all right.


808
0:59:29,323 --> 0:59:31,359
We'll look after nanny.


809
0:59:31,359 --> 0:59:35,363
I could take the boys to the dentist
on Thursday on their way back to school.


810
0:59:35,363 --> 0:59:37,365
But the whole point of them
having dentistry now...


811
0:59:37,365 --> 0:59:44,605
is so they can stuff themselves with
sweets for a week before we lose them.


812
0:59:44,605 --> 1:0:9,397
- Are you quite sure?
- Bosie'll look after me.


813
1:0:9,397 --> 1:0:11,365
Get your coat on, quick!


814
1:0:11,365 --> 1:0:15,2
I've got a present for you!


815
1:0:15,2 --> 1:0:17,38
Oh, God.


816
1:0:17,38 --> 1:0:20,408
- You're not still seedy, are you?
- Bosie, where have you been?


817
1:0:20,408 --> 1:0:23,1
I've had no one to talk to,
no one to look after me.


818
1:0:23,1 --> 1:0:26,848
Don't be so pathetic.
I've found you the divinest boy.


819
1:0:26,848 --> 1:0:29,784
- Bosie, you promised Constance...
- Bugger Constance.


820
1:0:29,784 --> 1:0:32,42
I'm not your nanny.
Come on. We're going out.


821
1:0:32,42 --> 1:0:36,491
Bosie, please.


822
1:0:36,491 --> 1:0:40,228
You look such an idiot
lying there. Revolting.


823
1:0:40,228 --> 1:0:42,497
- Have you forgotten how to wash?
- As a matter of fact...


824
1:0:42,497 --> 1:0:46,0
I'm dying for a glass of water.


825
1:0:46,0 --> 1:0:49,537
- You know where the jug is.
- Bosie, darling.


826
1:0:49,537 --> 1:0:53,441
It stinks in here. You'll be wanting me
to empty your chamber pot next.


827
1:0:53,441 --> 1:0:57,545
Well, I emptied your chamber pot.
I looked after you.


828
1:0:57,545 --> 1:0:59,947
Well, I'm not looking after you.
Not now.


829
1:0:59,947 --> 1:1:2,617
You don't interest me.
Not when you're ill.


830
1:1:2,617 --> 1:1:5,419
You're just a boring middle-aged man
with a blocked-up nose.


831
1:1:5,419 --> 1:1:9,657
- Bosie, dearest boy.
- Shut up!


832
1:1:9,657 --> 1:1:13,594
"Dearest boy, darling Bosie."
It doesn't mean anything.


833
1:1:13,594 --> 1:1:16,931
You don't love me. The only person
you've ever loved is yourself.


834
1:1:16,931 --> 1:1:19,233
You like me.
You lust after me.


835
1:1:19,233 --> 1:1:23,971
You go about with me because
I've got a title. That's all.


836
1:1:23,971 --> 1:1:26,407
You like to write about
dukes and duchesses...


837
1:1:26,407 --> 1:1:27,975
but you know nothing about them.


838
1:1:27,975 --> 1:1:29,844
You're the biggest snob
I've ever met...


839
1:1:29,844 --> 1:1:33,247
and you think you're so daring
because you fuck the occasional boy.


840
1:1:33,247 --> 1:1:35,583
Please, you're killing me.


841
1:1:35,583 --> 1:1:37,485
You'll just about do
when you're at your best.


842
1:1:37,485 --> 1:1:41,823
You're amusing... very amusing... but when
you're not at your best, you're no one.


843
1:1:41,823 --> 1:1:46,6
All I asked for
was a glass of water.


844
1:1:46,6 --> 1:1:52,6
For Christ's sake!
There you are then!


845
1:1:52,6 --> 1:2:0,775
Now will you shut up
about the fucking water?


846
1:2:0,775 --> 1:2:2,777
There are two boys
waiting out there.


847
1:2:2,777 --> 1:2:5,79
If you're not coming,
I'll fuck them both myself.


848
1:2:5,79 --> 1:2:9,784
I'll take them to the Grand and
fuck them in front of the whole hotel...


849
1:2:9,784 --> 1:2:27,768
and I'll send you the bill.


850
1:2:27,768 --> 1:2:29,27
Drink this.


851
1:2:29,27 --> 1:2:37,345
- It will help your fever.
- He's ashamed of loving men.


852
1:2:37,345 --> 1:2:40,348
His father bullies him,
his mother spoils him...


853
1:2:40,348 --> 1:2:42,483
and then berates him
for being spoiled.


854
1:2:42,483 --> 1:2:48,689
Neither of them gives him any real love.
They're torturing him.


855
1:2:48,689 --> 1:2:52,426
And what's truly dreadful
is that when...


856
1:2:52,426 --> 1:2:56,23
he can't bear it
and has one of his...


857
1:2:56,23 --> 1:2:58,366
he becomes
exactly like his father.


858
1:2:58,366 --> 1:3:4,38
- And he hates himself for that.
- You're too kind about him.


859
1:3:4,38 --> 1:3:10,177
You can't be too kind about
someone who's been so hurt.


860
1:3:10,177 --> 1:3:16,55
Yet if I go on trying to come
between Bosie and his father...


861
1:3:16,55 --> 1:3:18,252
that'll destroy me.


862
1:3:18,252 --> 1:3:22,623
Bosie's quite capable
of destroying you on his own.


863
1:3:22,623 --> 1:3:25,493
Look how much you wrote
while he was away.


864
1:3:25,493 --> 1:3:28,996
Two wonderful plays
which will run for years.


865
1:3:28,996 --> 1:3:39,974
Back comes Bosie,
and what have you written since?


866
1:3:39,974 --> 1:3:43,844
You know how much I...


867
1:3:43,844 --> 1:3:48,82
Iove and admire you...


868
1:3:48,82 --> 1:3:50,718
but you're throwing
your genius away.


869
1:3:50,718 --> 1:3:54,455
- For what?
- It's highly ironic.


870
1:3:54,455 --> 1:3:58,59
Queensberry thinks Bosie and I
are locked in nightly embrace...


871
1:3:58,59 --> 1:4:4,432
and in reality, we've been
the purest model of Greek love since...


872
1:4:4,432 --> 1:4:9,47
Bosie doesn't like doing it with me,
but I've loved him.


873
1:4:9,47 --> 1:4:14,8
- I've educated him.
- But he's never grown up.


874
1:4:14,8 --> 1:4:17,478
And he never will.


875
1:4:17,478 --> 1:4:20,481
I'm not taking him back, Robbie.


876
1:4:20,481 --> 1:4:24,218
Not again.


877
1:4:24,218 --> 1:4:26,52
I can't.


878
1:4:26,52 --> 1:4:30,858
I've been very foolish,
very fond...


879
1:4:30,858 --> 1:4:33,461
but now I must grow up myself.


880
1:4:33,461 --> 1:4:36,364
Oh, please, don't do that.


881
1:4:36,364 --> 1:4:42,269
You're an artist.
Artists are always children at heart.


882
1:4:42,269 --> 1:4:48,642
Oh, Robbie,
I sometimes I wonder if...


883
1:4:48,642 --> 1:4:56,5
Back page, sir.


884
1:4:56,5 --> 1:4:59,854
My God. Francis Douglas.


885
1:4:59,854 --> 1:5:1,856
- What?
- Bosie's brother.


886
1:5:1,856 --> 1:5:7,228
He's been found shot.
He's dead.


887
1:5:7,228 --> 1:5:12,8
But he's just got engaged.


888
1:5:12,8 --> 1:5:27,214
Poor, poor Bosie.
He'll be utterly distraught.


889
1:5:27,214 --> 1:5:30,317
<i>He killed himself.</i>


890
1:5:30,317 --> 1:5:33,888
It was my father.
He drove him to it.


891
1:5:33,888 --> 1:5:38,826
I'm sure your father's
just as upset as everyone else.


892
1:5:38,826 --> 1:5:43,597
No, he's not.


893
1:5:43,597 --> 1:5:47,301
He says it's a judgment
on Roseberry and my mother...


894
1:5:47,301 --> 1:5:59,28
and me and you.


895
1:5:59,28 --> 1:6:3,284
We've got to stop him, Oscar...


896
1:6:3,284 --> 1:6:9,29
before he drives
my whole family to suicide.


897
1:6:9,29 --> 1:6:12,526
I promise you, I won't let him
hurt you ever again.


898
1:6:12,526 --> 1:6:21,569
I promise.


899
1:6:21,569 --> 1:6:27,508
It's not enough.
I want him stopped.


900
1:6:27,508 --> 1:6:33,481
I want the whole world
to know what he's done...


901
1:6:33,481 --> 1:6:40,2
what an evil man he is.


902
1:6:40,2 --> 1:6:41,522
Table, my lord?


903
1:6:41,522 --> 1:6:44,225
Is Lord Alfred here?
And that shit and sod Wilde?


904
1:6:44,225 --> 1:6:47,561
No, my lord. Not tonight.


905
1:6:47,561 --> 1:7:4,345
Bugger must be at Kettner's.


906
1:7:4,345 --> 1:7:8,682
Is my son staying here?


907
1:7:8,682 --> 1:7:11,385
Is Lord Alfred Douglas
staying here?


908
1:7:11,385 --> 1:7:15,422
No, sir, he's not.


909
1:7:15,422 --> 1:7:21,862
- What about Wilde?
- No, sir.


910
1:7:21,862 --> 1:7:25,533
If I find
they have been staying here...


911
1:7:25,533 --> 1:8:1,101
I'll give you the biggest
whipping of your life.


912
1:8:1,101 --> 1:8:13,747
Well, I expect you two would
like a drink after your exertions.


913
1:8:13,747 --> 1:8:15,983
I must ask you to leave,
Mr. Wilde.


914
1:8:15,983 --> 1:8:18,919
My dear man,
what are you talking about?


915
1:8:18,919 --> 1:8:22,69
At once, please.


916
1:8:22,69 --> 1:8:38,72
What's the matter? My father
cracking the whip downstairs, is he?


917
1:8:38,72 --> 1:8:40,908
- My lord.
- Bosie.


918
1:8:40,908 --> 1:8:43,611
You're not frightened of what
this little man thinks, are you?


919
1:8:43,611 --> 1:8:52,553
I think the pleasures of the evening
should be resumed elsewhere.


920
1:8:52,553 --> 1:8:54,755
You're such a coward.


921
1:8:54,755 --> 1:8:56,957
You say you despise convention...


922
1:8:56,957 --> 1:9:0,561
but you're the most
conventional man I know.


923
1:9:0,561 --> 1:9:11,905
Come on then.
If we're going, let's go.


924
1:9:11,905 --> 1:9:14,275
Until tomorrow, Tommy.


925
1:9:14,275 --> 1:9:16,41
Good-bye, sir.


926
1:9:16,41 --> 1:9:24,218
I goes in, and there's
all this tropical fruit laid out.


927
1:9:24,218 --> 1:9:27,221
Wait a minute, Oscar!


928
1:9:27,221 --> 1:9:31,325
Alfred, how nice to see you.
And Charlie, looking so well.


929
1:9:31,325 --> 1:9:33,861
I'm afraid I'm busy this evening,
but we must have dinner again soon.


930
1:9:33,861 --> 1:9:39,333
It's not a question of dinner.
I got a letter of yours to Lord Alfred.


931
1:9:39,333 --> 1:9:42,169
It's a nice letter, Oscar.
Beautiful.


932
1:9:42,169 --> 1:9:46,73
"Lips like roses. The madness
of kisses in ancient Greece."


933
1:9:46,73 --> 1:9:48,242
Then I expect
it's one of my prose poems.


934
1:9:48,242 --> 1:9:49,943
There's a gentleman's
offered me 60 pounds for it.


935
1:9:49,943 --> 1:9:52,913
Then you must accept, Alfred.
I've never received so large a sum...


936
1:9:52,913 --> 1:9:55,215
for a prose work of that length
in all my life.


937
1:9:55,215 --> 1:9:58,886
Tell him I'm delighted that someone
in England values my work so highly.


938
1:9:58,886 --> 1:10:0,954
- Well, he's gone away.
- He's gone to the country.


939
1:10:0,954 --> 1:10:5,859
Well, I'm sure
he'll be back soon.


940
1:10:5,859 --> 1:10:10,264
Oscar, look. You couldn't
let us have something, could you?


941
1:10:10,264 --> 1:10:14,435
Bit short at the moment.
You know.


942
1:10:14,435 --> 1:10:17,37
Of course. Of course.


943
1:10:17,37 --> 1:10:19,94
Here's half a sovereign. Now you mind
you take good care of that letter.


944
1:10:19,94 --> 1:10:24,345
Lord Alfred is going to publish it
in sonnet form in his new magazine.


945
1:10:24,345 --> 1:10:29,283
For fuck's sake.


946
1:10:29,283 --> 1:10:31,552
It's no good
trying to rent you.


947
1:10:31,552 --> 1:10:34,521
You just laugh at us.


948
1:10:34,521 --> 1:10:37,624
- Here.
- Thank you.


949
1:10:37,624 --> 1:10:42,229
He can be very careless,
Lord Alfred.


950
1:10:42,229 --> 1:10:44,698
What a wonderfully
wicked life you lead.


951
1:10:44,698 --> 1:10:51,805
You boys. You boys.


952
1:10:51,805 --> 1:10:54,808
- Where is he?
- Mr. Wilde is not receiving visitors.


953
1:10:54,808 --> 1:10:57,311
- Where is he?
- He's busy, sir. I cannot...


954
1:10:57,311 --> 1:11:2,383
I wish you would get out of my way.
Get out of my way!


955
1:11:2,383 --> 1:11:4,918
Excuse me, sir,
there's a gentleman...


956
1:11:4,918 --> 1:11:7,287
You!


957
1:11:7,287 --> 1:11:10,224
Listen to me.


958
1:11:10,224 --> 1:11:14,128
You're a bugger!


959
1:11:14,128 --> 1:11:17,464
I don't allow people to talk to me like
that in my house, Lord Queensberry...


960
1:11:17,464 --> 1:11:20,0
or anywhere else.


961
1:11:20,0 --> 1:11:23,504
I suppose you've come to apologize for
the lies you've been spreading about me?


962
1:11:23,504 --> 1:11:27,708
I've come to tell you
to leave my son alone, you sodomite.


963
1:11:27,708 --> 1:11:31,779
The marquis appears to be very obsessed
with other people's sexual activities.


964
1:11:31,779 --> 1:11:33,847
Has it anything to do
with his new wife...


965
1:11:33,847 --> 1:11:37,418
I wonder, and the fact that she's
seeking divorce for non-consummation?


966
1:11:37,418 --> 1:11:40,521
Unless you swear that you'll have
nothing more to do with Bosie...


967
1:11:40,521 --> 1:11:42,89
I shall go to Scotland Yard.


968
1:11:42,89 --> 1:11:44,491
You can go to the devil.


969
1:11:44,491 --> 1:11:47,27
You and your...
Who is this gargoyle?


970
1:11:47,27 --> 1:11:51,64
You're a queer!
And a sham! A poseur!


971
1:11:51,64 --> 1:11:56,69
If I catch you and Bosie together again,
I'll give you such a thrashing.


972
1:11:56,69 --> 1:11:59,44
I believe Lord Queensberry
once invented some rules for boxing.


973
1:11:59,44 --> 1:12:1,375
I've no idea what they are...


974
1:12:1,375 --> 1:12:3,444
but the Oscar Wilde rule
is to shoot on sight.


975
1:12:3,444 --> 1:12:6,213
- Now, kindly leave my house.
- You can shut up!


976
1:12:6,213 --> 1:12:13,754
I shall leave
when I'm damn well ready.


977
1:12:13,754 --> 1:12:16,457
It's a scandal
what you've been doing.


978
1:12:16,457 --> 1:12:19,693
All the scandal is your own.


979
1:12:19,693 --> 1:12:22,129
Your treatment of your wives...


980
1:12:22,129 --> 1:12:24,131
your neglect of your children...


981
1:12:24,131 --> 1:12:27,501
and, above all,
the depraved insistence...


982
1:12:27,501 --> 1:12:32,773
that they be as tyrannical
and unloving as you are yourself.


983
1:12:32,773 --> 1:12:35,876
Arthur, this is
the Marquis of Queensberry...


984
1:12:35,876 --> 1:12:40,547
the most infamous brute
and the least tender father in London.


985
1:12:40,547 --> 1:12:45,619
Never let him
into my house again.


986
1:12:45,619 --> 1:12:49,256
Very well then.


987
1:12:49,256 --> 1:13:37,204
Let's get out of this stew.


988
1:13:37,204 --> 1:13:39,473
- Out of the way, then!
- I'm sorry, sir!


989
1:13:39,473 --> 1:13:49,783
I'm very sorry,
but it's just not possible!


990
1:13:49,783 --> 1:13:52,753
What are you doing?
Rotten vegetables?


991
1:13:52,753 --> 1:13:54,655
Give that to Oscar Wilde.


992
1:13:54,655 --> 1:13:57,791
Thank you, sir.
We'll take care of it.


993
1:13:57,791 --> 1:14:2,629
I wanted to give it to him
personally as a bouquet.


994
1:14:2,629 --> 1:14:7,0
I daresay you did, sir,
but you're not going to.


995
1:14:7,0 --> 1:14:11,4
He's a cur and a sod!


996
1:14:11,4 --> 1:14:12,739
And a bugger!


997
1:14:12,739 --> 1:14:17,578
You remember that!


998
1:14:17,578 --> 1:14:20,581
I always told you, Gwendolen,
my name is Ernest, didn't I?


999
1:14:20,581 --> 1:14:22,916
Well, it is Ernest after all.


1000
1:14:22,916 --> 1:14:26,86
I mean, it naturally is Ernest.


1001
1:14:26,86 --> 1:14:29,69
Yes, I remember now
that the general was called Ernest.


1002
1:14:29,69 --> 1:14:35,495
I knew I had some particular reason
for disliking the name.


1003
1:14:35,495 --> 1:14:39,99
Ernest! My own Ernest!


1004
1:14:39,99 --> 1:14:42,803
I knew from the first
you could have had no other name.


1005
1:14:42,803 --> 1:14:46,6
Gwendolen, it's a terrible thing
for a man to find out suddenly...


1006
1:14:46,6 --> 1:14:50,43
that all his life he's been
speaking nothing but the truth.


1007
1:14:50,43 --> 1:14:52,45
Can you forgive me?


1008
1:14:52,45 --> 1:14:55,749
I can, for I feel
you are sure to change.


1009
1:14:55,749 --> 1:14:58,385
- My own one!
- Laetitia.


1010
1:14:58,385 --> 1:15:0,387
Frederick! At last!


1011
1:15:0,387 --> 1:15:5,626
- Cecily! At last!
- Gwendolen! At last!


1012
1:15:5,626 --> 1:15:11,31
My nephew, you seem to be
displaying signs of triviality.


1013
1:15:11,31 --> 1:15:13,433
On the contrary, Aunt Augusta...


1014
1:15:13,433 --> 1:15:16,637
I've now realized
for the first time in my life...


1015
1:15:16,637 --> 1:15:48,335
the vital importance
of being earnest.


1016
1:15:48,335 --> 1:15:50,837
Allen, you were wonderful!
Thank you all so much.


1017
1:15:50,837 --> 1:15:53,306
They're calling for you.
You must come on. Curtain, curtain.


1018
1:15:53,306 --> 1:16:43,29
- No, no, George, no, no.
- Come on!


1019
1:16:43,29 --> 1:16:48,328
- Mr. Wilde, sir.
- Yes?


1020
1:16:48,328 --> 1:17:1,875
- For you.
- Thank you.


1021
1:17:1,875 --> 1:17:5,512
"For Oscar Wilde...


1022
1:17:5,512 --> 1:17:6,947
Ponce," is it?


1023
1:17:6,947 --> 1:17:9,316
"Ponce and 'somdomite."'


1024
1:17:9,316 --> 1:17:13,553
"Posing as a sodomite."
He's illiterate... illiterate, ignorant.


1025
1:17:13,553 --> 1:17:16,656
- It's hideous.
- We've got him now, Robbie.


1026
1:17:16,656 --> 1:17:18,625
He wrote it down.
The porter read it.


1027
1:17:18,625 --> 1:17:21,495
That makes it a public libel.
Now we can take him to court.


1028
1:17:21,495 --> 1:17:26,833
For God's sake.


1029
1:17:26,833 --> 1:17:29,936
Oscar, you mustn't do that.
That would be... I mean...


1030
1:17:29,936 --> 1:17:32,405
We've just been waiting for a chance
to get him in the dock...


1031
1:17:32,405 --> 1:17:35,342
and show the world what a swine
and shit he's always been.


1032
1:17:35,342 --> 1:17:39,346
- To me, my mother, my brothers.
- But he'll plead justification.


1033
1:17:39,346 --> 1:17:42,182
He'll call all the renters
as witnesses for the defense.


1034
1:17:42,182 --> 1:17:45,85
Of course he won't.
He doesn't know what a renter is.


1035
1:17:45,85 --> 1:17:49,656
I hear he's had detectives following you
ever since you came back from Egypt.


1036
1:17:49,656 --> 1:17:53,627
He can't prove anything.
But we can.


1037
1:17:53,627 --> 1:17:55,929
We can prove he's the vilest man
that ever walked the earth.


1038
1:17:55,929 --> 1:17:57,931
Tear the card up, Oscar.
Pretend you never got it.


1039
1:17:57,931 --> 1:18:1,34
Are you mad?
That's our main piece of evidence.


1040
1:18:1,34 --> 1:18:3,67
I'm sure if Oscar went abroad
for a few months...


1041
1:18:3,67 --> 1:18:5,806
lived on royalties
while your father calms down...


1042
1:18:5,806 --> 1:18:8,542
- Whose side are you on?
- Bosie, if this goes to court...


1043
1:18:8,542 --> 1:18:10,644
Oscar will have to tell lies...


1044
1:18:10,644 --> 1:18:13,58
perjure himself...
everything will come out.


1045
1:18:13,58 --> 1:18:16,483
Whatever the result,
it will be utter disaster.


1046
1:18:16,483 --> 1:18:18,218
You're an enemy then.


1047
1:18:18,218 --> 1:18:22,322
No, no, Bosie, please.
Robbie...


1048
1:18:22,322 --> 1:18:25,992
you're a dear boy, but I can't
even think of leaving the country.


1049
1:18:25,992 --> 1:18:31,164
As a matter of fact, I can't even
leave this hotel. I can't pay the bill.


1050
1:18:31,164 --> 1:18:34,0
We can raise you money,
for heaven's sake.


1051
1:18:34,0 --> 1:18:36,736
Anyway, what about
your royalties?


1052
1:18:36,736 --> 1:18:39,94
We shall need all the money
we can get for the libel case.


1053
1:18:39,94 --> 1:18:44,611
My father can't go on making
all our lives a torment like this.


1054
1:18:44,611 --> 1:18:47,681
Oscar, I beg you.


1055
1:18:47,681 --> 1:18:49,449
I'm not going to run away, Robbie.


1056
1:18:49,449 --> 1:18:52,886
I'm not going to hide.
That would be the English thing to do.


1057
1:18:52,886 --> 1:18:56,456
If you take Queensberry to court,
all hell will break loose.


1058
1:18:56,456 --> 1:19:0,126
All my life I've fought
against the English vice:


1059
1:19:0,126 --> 1:19:3,163
Hypocrisy...
not that that's the point.


1060
1:19:3,163 --> 1:19:7,667
The point is, Queensberry's already
caused the death of one of his sons.


1061
1:19:7,667 --> 1:19:13,707
If I don't try and stop him now,
whom will he harm next?


1062
1:19:13,707 --> 1:19:16,877
<i>He's avoiding me, Robbie.</i>


1063
1:19:16,877 --> 1:19:20,714
I know what everyone's saying,
but it's not true.


1064
1:19:20,714 --> 1:19:24,251
It's not true.


1065
1:19:24,251 --> 1:19:28,922
- Is it?
- Of course not.


1066
1:19:28,922 --> 1:19:32,659
Oh, it's so shaming.


1067
1:19:32,659 --> 1:19:37,3
No, I find it easier to stand.


1068
1:19:37,3 --> 1:19:41,434
I'm going to Torquay for a month,
try to get my back right.


1069
1:19:41,434 --> 1:19:45,5
- Oscar's been so busy...
- I'm sure he'll be terribly upset...


1070
1:19:45,5 --> 1:19:49,843
when he knows you've been
in so much pain.


1071
1:19:49,843 --> 1:19:53,847
The truth is,
I need some money.


1072
1:19:53,847 --> 1:19:57,784
Not even sure where he is
to ask for it.


1073
1:19:57,784 --> 1:20:0,687
It does seem rather hard when he's
having such an extraordinary success.


1074
1:20:0,687 --> 1:20:6,26
I think I can find him.


1075
1:20:6,26 --> 1:20:8,628
I keep hearing these stories
about Bosie and his father.


1076
1:20:8,628 --> 1:20:14,801
- I'm sure you don't want to...
- Oh, yes. I do.


1077
1:20:14,801 --> 1:20:19,439
Men think women should be
protected by not knowing.


1078
1:20:19,439 --> 1:20:24,878
Not knowing only makes it worse.


1079
1:20:24,878 --> 1:20:29,883
Is there going to be trouble?


1080
1:20:29,883 --> 1:20:33,653
I hope not.


1081
1:20:33,653 --> 1:20:36,222
<i>I believe a prosecution
would certainly succeed...</i>


1082
1:20:36,222 --> 1:20:38,258
provided...
and I stress this...


1083
1:20:38,258 --> 1:20:42,295
provided there is no truth whatever in
the accusation made by Lord Queensberry.


1084
1:20:42,295 --> 1:20:46,232
Of course
there's no truth in it.


1085
1:20:46,232 --> 1:21:1,14
Then so long as I have Mr. Wilde's
assurance that that is indeed the case.


1086
1:21:1,14 --> 1:21:4,918
There is no truth
in the accusation whatever.


1087
1:21:4,918 --> 1:21:10,29
Good. Excellent.


1088
1:21:10,29 --> 1:21:14,127
The defense, I understand,
will be led by Mr. Edward Carson.


1089
1:21:14,127 --> 1:21:18,231
Old Ned? I was at college
with him in Dublin.


1090
1:21:18,231 --> 1:21:24,804
No doubt he will perform his task with
all the bitterness of an old friend.


1091
1:21:24,804 --> 1:21:27,54
In writing a book or a play,
I'm concerned entirely with literature...


1092
1:21:27,54 --> 1:21:31,778
with art... I do not aim
at doing good or evil...


1093
1:21:31,778 --> 1:21:34,147
but at making a thing that will have
some quality of beauty.


1094
1:21:34,147 --> 1:21:39,619
Well, listen, sir. Here is
one of your pieces of literature.


1095
1:21:39,619 --> 1:21:42,555
"Wickedness is a myth
invented by good people...


1096
1:21:42,555 --> 1:21:49,629
to account for the curious
attractiveness of others."


1097
1:21:49,629 --> 1:21:51,297
Do you think that true?


1098
1:21:51,297 --> 1:21:53,8
Oh, I rarely think
anything I write is true.


1099
1:21:53,8 --> 1:22:2,308
"If one tells the truth, one is sure,
sooner or later, to be found out."


1100
1:22:2,308 --> 1:22:6,46
That is a pleasing paradox, but
I do not set store by it as an axiom.


1101
1:22:6,46 --> 1:22:8,581
Is it good for the young?


1102
1:22:8,581 --> 1:22:11,918
Anything is good that stimulates
thought, at whatever age.


1103
1:22:11,918 --> 1:22:13,92
Whether moral or immoral?


1104
1:22:13,92 --> 1:22:16,956
There's no such thing
as morality or immorality in thought.


1105
1:22:16,956 --> 1:22:19,993
What about this then?


1106
1:22:19,993 --> 1:22:24,531
"Pleasure is the only thing
one should live for."


1107
1:22:24,531 --> 1:22:28,168
I think that the realization of
one's self is the prime aim of life...


1108
1:22:28,168 --> 1:22:32,572
and that to realize through pleasure is
finer than to do so through pain.


1109
1:22:32,572 --> 1:22:39,479
I am, on this point, entirely on
the side of the ancients, the Greeks.


1110
1:22:39,479 --> 1:22:42,749
<i>How long have you known
Alfred Taylor?</i>


1111
1:22:42,749 --> 1:22:45,752
<i>About two years,
two-and-a-half years.</i>


1112
1:22:45,752 --> 1:22:49,622
- Is he an intimate friend of yours?
- I wouldn't call him that, no.


1113
1:22:49,622 --> 1:22:52,292
But you went often to his rooms?


1114
1:22:52,292 --> 1:22:54,694
About seven or eight times,
perhaps.


1115
1:22:54,694 --> 1:23:1,935
Did you know Mr. Taylor kept
ladies' dresses in his rooms?


1116
1:23:1,935 --> 1:23:6,873
Did you know he was notorious
for introducing young men to older men?


1117
1:23:6,873 --> 1:23:10,21
I never heard it in my life.


1118
1:23:10,21 --> 1:23:13,279
Has he introduced
young men to you?


1119
1:23:13,279 --> 1:23:15,281
Yes.


1120
1:23:15,281 --> 1:23:18,952
- How many young men?
- About five.


1121
1:23:18,952 --> 1:23:23,69
- What were their occupations?
- I really don't know.


1122
1:23:23,69 --> 1:23:26,459
Oh, well, let me tell you,
Mr. Wilde.


1123
1:23:26,459 --> 1:23:30,43
You met a man called
Charles Parker there, I believe.


1124
1:23:30,43 --> 1:23:31,598
Yes.


1125
1:23:31,598 --> 1:23:34,534
Charles Parker is...


1126
1:23:34,534 --> 1:23:37,937
a gentleman's valet.


1127
1:23:37,937 --> 1:23:39,939
You met his brother there
too, I believe.


1128
1:23:39,939 --> 1:23:44,31
- Yes.
- He is a groom.


1129
1:23:44,31 --> 1:23:46,713
I didn't care tuppence
what they were.


1130
1:23:46,713 --> 1:23:51,484
I liked them. I have a passion
to civilize the community.


1131
1:23:51,484 --> 1:23:55,922
I recognize no social distinctions
at all of any kind.


1132
1:23:55,922 --> 1:23:58,24
To me, youth...
the mere fact of youth...


1133
1:23:58,24 --> 1:24:2,295
is so wonderful that I would sooner
talk to a young man for half an hour...


1134
1:24:2,295 --> 1:24:6,799
than, well, than be
cross-examined in court.


1135
1:24:6,799 --> 1:24:9,903
So, do I understand that...


1136
1:24:9,903 --> 1:24:13,473
even a boy you might pick up in the
street would be a pleasing companion?


1137
1:24:13,473 --> 1:24:17,777
I would talk to a street Arab
with pleasure if he would talk to me.


1138
1:24:17,777 --> 1:24:19,779
- And take him to your rooms?
- Yes.


1139
1:24:19,779 --> 1:24:24,217
And then commit
improprieties with him?


1140
1:24:24,217 --> 1:24:29,88
Certainly not.


1141
1:24:29,88 --> 1:24:32,859
<i>You withdraw your libel action
against Lord Queensberry.</i>


1142
1:24:32,859 --> 1:24:34,928
Well and good.


1143
1:24:34,928 --> 1:24:38,364
But there remains the question
of the evidence...


1144
1:24:38,364 --> 1:24:41,968
Lord Queensberry's evidence
against you.


1145
1:24:41,968 --> 1:24:47,707
My information is that the Crown
wishes to pursue the matter.


1146
1:24:47,707 --> 1:24:52,845
In which case, an arrest
and a charge of gross indecency...


1147
1:24:52,845 --> 1:24:54,948
are certain to follow.


1148
1:24:54,948 --> 1:24:58,952
The maximum sentence
is two years hard labor.


1149
1:24:58,952 --> 1:25:2,989
Nine months hard labor
is reckoned to be more...


1150
1:25:2,989 --> 1:25:4,991
than a man of our background...


1151
1:25:4,991 --> 1:25:9,495
can survive.


1152
1:25:9,495 --> 1:25:11,531
The children, the boys...


1153
1:25:11,531 --> 1:25:14,634
- I must go and see them.
- You have no time for that.


1154
1:25:14,634 --> 1:25:19,72
But my wife...
I have to say good-bye to my wife.


1155
1:25:19,72 --> 1:25:21,841
Unless you positively wish
to subject her...


1156
1:25:21,841 --> 1:25:24,244
to the further humiliation
of seeing you arrested...


1157
1:25:24,244 --> 1:25:27,58
and taken away
in front of the gutter press...


1158
1:25:27,58 --> 1:25:36,256
<i>Mr. Wilde, you must go.</i>


1159
1:25:36,256 --> 1:25:40,526
Oscar, you must take that train.


1160
1:25:40,526 --> 1:25:43,563
Practically everyone
you know will be on it.


1161
1:25:43,563 --> 1:25:52,839
At least 600 single gentlemen,
all in abject terror of arrest.


1162
1:25:52,839 --> 1:25:57,71
Where your life leads you,
you must go.


1163
1:25:57,71 --> 1:25:59,879
<i>I defy society.</i>


1164
1:25:59,879 --> 1:26:3,349
Tell him to go.


1165
1:26:3,349 --> 1:26:7,553
He must save himself.


1166
1:26:7,553 --> 1:26:9,656
Tell him to go abroad.


1167
1:26:9,656 --> 1:26:13,426
I've been telling him all day.


1168
1:26:13,426 --> 1:26:22,235
He won't budge.


1169
1:26:22,235 --> 1:26:26,572
People have never understood
the courage he needed to be himself.


1170
1:26:26,572 --> 1:26:28,808
You must go abroad too.


1171
1:26:28,808 --> 1:26:34,414
We must all go abroad at once.


1172
1:26:34,414 --> 1:26:39,252
Oscar says, will you
tell the boys good-bye.


1173
1:26:39,252 --> 1:26:45,124
I need to go through his papers.


1174
1:26:45,124 --> 1:26:48,961
You know,
I was always too silent.


1175
1:26:48,961 --> 1:26:56,402
If I'd known...


1176
1:26:56,402 --> 1:26:58,504
If I'd only spoken up.


1177
1:26:58,504 --> 1:27:2,342
It wouldn't have made
any difference.


1178
1:27:2,342 --> 1:27:5,78
Perhaps not...


1179
1:27:5,78 --> 1:27:31,838
but at least I wouldn't
blame myself now.


1180
1:27:31,838 --> 1:27:35,208
<i>You're an Irish gentleman.
Of course, you must stay.</i>


1181
1:27:35,208 --> 1:27:37,61
Your father fought
when he was libeled.


1182
1:27:37,61 --> 1:27:40,613
<i>- I was in the courts myself. I fought...
- Yes, I know, Madre.</i>


1183
1:27:40,613 --> 1:27:44,517
You will fight these
English philistines, and you'll win.


1184
1:27:44,517 --> 1:27:49,389
And even if you lose...
if you go to prison...


1185
1:27:49,389 --> 1:27:52,492
you'll always be my son.


1186
1:27:52,492 --> 1:27:56,295
Of course, it's too late
to change that now.


1187
1:27:56,295 --> 1:27:58,131
If you go, Oscar...


1188
1:27:58,131 --> 1:28:0,6
I'll never speak to you again.


1189
1:28:0,6 --> 1:28:5,571
No one will ever speak
to me again, whatever I do.


1190
1:28:5,571 --> 1:28:8,908
<i>Of course I'm your son, Madre...</i>


1191
1:28:8,908 --> 1:28:12,245
which is why,
even if I lose...


1192
1:28:12,245 --> 1:28:17,617
the English
will never forget me.


1193
1:28:17,617 --> 1:28:48,381
My darling.


1194
1:28:48,381 --> 1:28:52,118
Get out of my way.
Get out! Out!


1195
1:28:52,118 --> 1:29:2,328
Take me away at once!


1196
1:29:2,328 --> 1:29:4,53
Lady Wilde. Lady Wilde!


1197
1:29:4,53 --> 1:29:7,567
Have you anything to say about
your son's disgrace, Lady Wilde?


1198
1:29:7,567 --> 1:29:17,76
<i>Have you anything to say?</i>


1199
1:29:17,76 --> 1:29:25,284
Come in.


1200
1:29:25,284 --> 1:29:28,754
Mr. Wilde, I believe.


1201
1:29:28,754 --> 1:29:29,922
Yes, yes.


1202
1:29:29,922 --> 1:29:32,225
We have a warrant here
for your arrest...


1203
1:29:32,225 --> 1:29:43,169
on a charge
of committing indecent acts.


1204
1:29:43,169 --> 1:29:45,438
<i>I recommend Switzerland
as soon as possible.</i>


1205
1:29:45,438 --> 1:29:50,743
You will have to change
your name, of course.


1206
1:29:50,743 --> 1:29:52,78
I can't.


1207
1:29:52,78 --> 1:29:54,78
My dear Constance,
the name of Wilde will be...


1208
1:29:54,78 --> 1:29:56,949
a word of execration
for the next thousand years.


1209
1:29:56,949 --> 1:30:0,686
You can't possibly let your boys grow up
with people knowing who they are.


1210
1:30:0,686 --> 1:30:2,688
Think of their lives at school.


1211
1:30:2,688 --> 1:30:6,459
Thank you for your advice.


1212
1:30:6,459 --> 1:30:8,694
I'm sorry our friendship
has to end like this.


1213
1:30:8,694 --> 1:30:12,965
- Oh, you will always be my friend.
- I am still Oscar's wife.


1214
1:30:12,965 --> 1:30:17,336
That must cease forthwith.
Forthwith. Do you understand?


1215
1:30:17,336 --> 1:30:20,306
Anybody who has anything
to do with Oscar from now on...


1216
1:30:20,306 --> 1:30:23,342
will never be received
in society again...


1217
1:30:23,342 --> 1:30:29,749
ever.


1218
1:30:29,749 --> 1:30:42,395
Oh, God, Ada.
What is going to happen to him?


1219
1:30:42,395 --> 1:30:44,564
That's Oscar Wilde's boy.


1220
1:30:44,564 --> 1:30:47,199
Oscar, you must let me
in the witness box.


1221
1:30:47,199 --> 1:30:49,669
If the jury can only hear
what I have to say...


1222
1:30:49,669 --> 1:30:51,938
Bosie, darling boy.


1223
1:30:51,938 --> 1:30:55,7
As soon as they see you
in all your golden youth...


1224
1:30:55,7 --> 1:30:57,243
and me in all my corruption...


1225
1:30:57,243 --> 1:31:0,713
You didn't corrupt me.
I corrupted you, if anything.


1226
1:31:0,713 --> 1:31:2,715
That's not how it will seem.


1227
1:31:2,715 --> 1:31:6,18
But I must have my say.
It's outrageous.


1228
1:31:6,18 --> 1:31:9,221
Everyone else has said everything,
anything that came into his head.


1229
1:31:9,221 --> 1:31:11,991
But I'm the person
all this is about.


1230
1:31:11,991 --> 1:31:14,527
It's me my father wants
to get at, not you.


1231
1:31:14,527 --> 1:31:17,29
It's outrageous
that I can't have my say.


1232
1:31:17,29 --> 1:31:21,601
It won't help, Bosie.
It may actually make things worse.


1233
1:31:21,601 --> 1:31:27,907
But my father will win.
I can't endure my father winning.


1234
1:31:27,907 --> 1:31:30,209
You must go away, dear boy.


1235
1:31:30,209 --> 1:31:36,616
I couldn't bear for them
to arrest you.


1236
1:31:36,616 --> 1:31:42,388
I can't bear what they're
saying about you in court.


1237
1:31:42,388 --> 1:31:46,392
Jesus Christ.


1238
1:31:46,392 --> 1:31:48,628
Good-bye, Bosie, dear boy.


1239
1:31:48,628 --> 1:31:51,897
Don't let anyone, anything,
ever change your feeling for me...


1240
1:31:51,897 --> 1:31:53,633
change your love.


1241
1:31:53,633 --> 1:31:56,636
- See you next time.
- Time's up, my lord.


1242
1:31:56,636 --> 1:32:11,751
Oscar, never. They never will.
I won't let them.


1243
1:32:11,751 --> 1:32:14,52
<i>You've been a great deal
in the company of Lord Alfred Douglas?</i>


1244
1:32:14,52 --> 1:32:17,39
Oh, yes.


1245
1:32:17,39 --> 1:32:20,526
- Did he read his poems to you?
- Yes.


1246
1:32:20,526 --> 1:32:23,963
So, you can perhaps
understand that...


1247
1:32:23,963 --> 1:32:26,399
some of his verses...


1248
1:32:26,399 --> 1:32:32,772
would not be acceptable to a reader
with an ordinary balance to mind?


1249
1:32:32,772 --> 1:32:34,74
I'm not prepared to say.


1250
1:32:34,74 --> 1:32:37,943
It's a question of taste
and temperament...


1251
1:32:37,943 --> 1:32:40,179
and individuality.


1252
1:32:40,179 --> 1:32:43,315
I should say that one man's poetry
is another man's poison.


1253
1:32:43,315 --> 1:32:45,851
Yes, I daresay.


1254
1:32:45,851 --> 1:32:48,521
But in this poem
by Lord Alfred Douglas...


1255
1:32:48,521 --> 1:32:50,99
"Two Loves"...


1256
1:32:50,99 --> 1:32:52,992
there is one love,
true love...


1257
1:32:52,992 --> 1:32:56,796
which... and I quote...


1258
1:32:56,796 --> 1:33:0,599
"fills the hearts of boy and girl
with mutual flame."


1259
1:33:0,599 --> 1:33:4,87
And, there is another:


1260
1:33:4,87 --> 1:33:11,444
"I am the love
that dare not speak its name."


1261
1:33:11,444 --> 1:33:14,58
Was that poem explained to you?


1262
1:33:14,58 --> 1:33:18,5
- I think it's clear.
- There's no doubt as to what it means?


1263
1:33:18,5 --> 1:33:19,819
Most certainly not.


1264
1:33:19,819 --> 1:33:22,855
So, is it not clear
that the love described...


1265
1:33:22,855 --> 1:33:30,996
relates to natural
and unnatural love?


1266
1:33:30,996 --> 1:33:47,68
Then what is the love
that dare not speak its name?


1267
1:33:47,68 --> 1:33:51,55
The love that dare not
speak its name...


1268
1:33:51,55 --> 1:33:54,22
in this century...


1269
1:33:54,22 --> 1:33:56,889
is such a great affection...


1270
1:33:56,889 --> 1:34:0,459
of an elder for a younger man...


1271
1:34:0,459 --> 1:34:3,62
as there was between
David and Jonathan...


1272
1:34:3,62 --> 1:34:8,0
such as Plato made
the very basis of his philosophy...


1273
1:34:8,0 --> 1:34:11,837
and such as you may find in
the sonnets of Michelangelo...


1274
1:34:11,837 --> 1:34:15,608
and Shakespeare.


1275
1:34:15,608 --> 1:34:20,246
It is, in this century,
misunderstood...


1276
1:34:20,246 --> 1:34:23,883
so much misunderstood
that it may be described as...


1277
1:34:23,883 --> 1:34:26,786
the love that dare not
speak its name.


1278
1:34:26,786 --> 1:34:32,124
And, on account of it,
I am placed where I am now.


1279
1:34:32,124 --> 1:34:36,562
It is beautiful.
It is fine.


1280
1:34:36,562 --> 1:34:40,132
It is the noblest form
of affection.


1281
1:34:40,132 --> 1:34:44,703
There's nothing unnatural
about it.


1282
1:34:44,703 --> 1:34:47,239
It is intellectual...


1283
1:34:47,239 --> 1:34:51,177
and it repeatedly exists
between an elder and a younger man...


1284
1:34:51,177 --> 1:34:55,8
when the elder has intellect...


1285
1:34:55,8 --> 1:34:57,65
and the younger man...


1286
1:34:57,65 --> 1:35:4,89
has all the joy, hope
and glamour of life before him.


1287
1:35:4,89 --> 1:35:9,161
That it should be so,
the world does not understand.


1288
1:35:9,161 --> 1:35:11,297
The world mocks at it...


1289
1:35:11,297 --> 1:35:34,253
and sometimes puts one
in the pillory for it.


1290
1:35:34,253 --> 1:35:37,423
The crime of which
you have been convicted...


1291
1:35:37,423 --> 1:35:39,625
is so bad...


1292
1:35:39,625 --> 1:35:43,28
that I shall pass
the severest sentence...


1293
1:35:43,28 --> 1:35:46,398
that the law will allow.


1294
1:35:46,398 --> 1:35:52,404
In my judgment, it is totally
inadequate for such a case as this.


1295
1:35:52,404 --> 1:35:55,608
It is the worst case
I have ever tried!


1296
1:35:55,608 --> 1:35:58,51
The sentence of the court...


1297
1:35:58,51 --> 1:36:0,813
is that you will be imprisoned...


1298
1:36:0,813 --> 1:36:4,183
<i>and held to hard labor...</i>


1299
1:36:4,183 --> 1:36:7,52
<i>- Stand aside, please.
- for two years.</i>


1300
1:36:7,52 --> 1:36:14,426
- Shame.
- Pervert.


1301
1:36:14,426 --> 1:36:22,801
Pervert!


1302
1:36:22,801 --> 1:36:45,124
Shame on you!


1303
1:36:45,124 --> 1:37:12,384
Disgusting!


1304
1:37:12,384 --> 1:37:15,788
<i>A slim thing,
gold-haired like an angel...</i>


1305
1:37:15,788 --> 1:37:18,324
<i>stands always at my side.</i>


1306
1:37:18,324 --> 1:37:22,261
<i>He moves in the gloom
like a white flower.</i>


1307
1:37:22,261 --> 1:37:43,82
<i>I thought but to defend him from
his father. I thought of nothing else.</i>


1308
1:37:43,82 --> 1:37:45,884
<i>Now my life seems
to have gone from me.</i>


1309
1:37:45,884 --> 1:37:48,32
<i>I'm caught in a terrible net.</i>


1310
1:37:48,32 --> 1:37:51,223
<i>But so long as I think
he is thinking of me...</i>


1311
1:37:51,223 --> 1:37:55,828
<i>my sweet rose, my delicate flower,
my lily of lilies...</i>


1312
1:37:55,828 --> 1:37:59,999
<i>it is in prison that I shall
test the power of love.</i>


1313
1:37:59,999 --> 1:38:3,302
<i>I shall see if I can't make
the bitter waters sweet...</i>


1314
1:38:3,302 --> 1:38:19,284
<i>by the intensity of the love
I bear you.</i>


1315
1:38:19,284 --> 1:38:23,722
<i>He asked me not to change.
Those were his last words to me...</i>


1316
1:38:23,722 --> 1:38:25,824
"Don't change."


1317
1:38:25,824 --> 1:38:30,596
Well, things are going to have
to change when he comes out.


1318
1:38:30,596 --> 1:38:32,898
He'll have no money at all.


1319
1:38:32,898 --> 1:38:35,701
- So you're blaming me, too, are you?
- I'm not blaming anyone.


1320
1:38:35,701 --> 1:38:40,472
Bosie, you're not the only person
on this earth Oscar cares about.


1321
1:38:40,472 --> 1:38:43,609
You've always hated me,
Robbie...


1322
1:38:43,609 --> 1:38:56,889
because Oscar loved and still loves me
when you were just one of his boys.


1323
1:38:56,889 --> 1:39:1,593
I'm suffering just as much
as he is, you know.


1324
1:39:1,593 --> 1:39:3,495
My life's ruined too.


1325
1:39:3,495 --> 1:39:8,67
I'm much younger than he is. I've hardly
had any life, and it's ruined already.


1326
1:39:8,67 --> 1:39:11,937
When Oscar gets out,
we'll live together properly.


1327
1:39:11,937 --> 1:39:15,808
We'll take a villa
somewhere near here... Posilipo...


1328
1:39:15,808 --> 1:39:20,546
- or Ischia.
- Or Capri.


1329
1:39:20,546 --> 1:39:23,82
I'll take care of him.


1330
1:39:23,82 --> 1:39:26,752
I'll give him
everything he wants.


1331
1:39:26,752 --> 1:39:31,256
I love him, Robbie.


1332
1:39:31,256 --> 1:39:50,542
Oscar's mine,
and I'm going to have him.


1333
1:39:50,542 --> 1:39:55,547
<i>"Years went over, and the giant
grew very old and very feeble.</i>


1334
1:39:55,547 --> 1:39:59,618
<i>He couldn't play about anymore,
so he sat in a huge armchair...</i>


1335
1:39:59,618 --> 1:40:7,86
<i>and watched the children at their games
and admired his garden.</i>


1336
1:40:7,86 --> 1:40:10,496
<i>'I have many beautiful flowers, '
he said.</i>


1337
1:40:10,496 --> 1:40:52,638
<i>'But the children are
the most beautiful flowers of all. "'</i>


1338
1:40:52,638 --> 1:40:56,875
I'm afraid Cyril has got
some idea why you're here.


1339
1:40:56,875 --> 1:41:2,114
I'm sending him
to school in Germany.


1340
1:41:2,114 --> 1:41:8,287
I can't manage them on my own.


1341
1:41:8,287 --> 1:41:11,19
Your back isn't better then?


1342
1:41:11,19 --> 1:41:14,86
No, not really.


1343
1:41:14,86 --> 1:41:19,198
I may have to have an operation.


1344
1:41:19,198 --> 1:41:22,868
What I've done
to you and the boys...


1345
1:41:22,868 --> 1:41:24,903
I can't...


1346
1:41:24,903 --> 1:41:30,275
I shall never forgive myself.


1347
1:41:30,275 --> 1:41:35,38
If we could choose
our natures...


1348
1:41:35,38 --> 1:41:37,649
If we could only choose.


1349
1:41:37,649 --> 1:41:42,554
But it's no use.


1350
1:41:42,554 --> 1:41:47,759
Whatever our natures are,
we must fulfill them...


1351
1:41:47,759 --> 1:41:49,962
or our lives... my life...


1352
1:41:49,962 --> 1:41:55,834
would have been filled
with dishonesty.


1353
1:41:55,834 --> 1:42:4,76
Even more dishonesty
than there actually was.


1354
1:42:4,76 --> 1:42:8,547
I've always loved you,
Constance.


1355
1:42:8,547 --> 1:42:12,317
You must believe me.


1356
1:42:12,317 --> 1:42:14,953
I don't see
how you can have done...


1357
1:42:14,953 --> 1:42:17,99
not truly.


1358
1:42:17,99 --> 1:42:19,958
Not if all the time...


1359
1:42:19,958 --> 1:42:24,529
I didn't know.


1360
1:42:24,529 --> 1:42:28,867
"Know thyself,"
I used to say.


1361
1:42:28,867 --> 1:42:33,38
I didn't know myself.


1362
1:42:33,38 --> 1:42:38,277
I didn't know.


1363
1:42:38,277 --> 1:42:43,81
I suppose you want a divorce.


1364
1:42:43,81 --> 1:42:48,287
You have every reason.


1365
1:42:48,287 --> 1:42:51,79
I've been thinking,
when you do come out...


1366
1:42:51,79 --> 1:42:54,76
when they let you out...
you can go to Switzerland or Italy...


1367
1:42:54,76 --> 1:42:58,83
write another play,
get yourself back.


1368
1:42:58,83 --> 1:43:1,5
You can.


1369
1:43:1,5 --> 1:43:14,946
You're so clever.
You can.


1370
1:43:14,946 --> 1:43:21,52
I don't want a divorce.


1371
1:43:21,52 --> 1:43:25,957
Will you ever let me
see the children again?


1372
1:43:25,957 --> 1:43:34,533
Of course.


1373
1:43:34,533 --> 1:43:40,405
But there must be one condition:


1374
1:43:40,405 --> 1:43:44,509
Oscar, you must never
see Bosie again.


1375
1:43:44,509 --> 1:43:52,918
If I saw Bosie now,
I'd kill him.


1376
1:43:52,918 --> 1:44:3,962
The children love you, Oscar.


1377
1:44:3,962 --> 1:44:15,44
They'll always love you.


1378
1:44:15,44 --> 1:44:18,9
Did anyone tell you?


1379
1:44:18,9 --> 1:44:29,588
<i>They've been performing
Salome in Paris.</i>


1380
1:44:29,588 --> 1:44:33,558
<i>"The giant hastened across the grass
and came near to the child.</i>


1381
1:44:33,558 --> 1:44:36,395
<i>And when he came quite close,
his face grew red with anger.</i>


1382
1:44:36,395 --> 1:44:40,932
<i>And he said,
'Who hath dared to wound thee? '</i>


1383
1:44:40,932 --> 1:44:44,236
<i>For on the palms of the child's hands
were the prints of two nails.</i>


1384
1:44:44,236 --> 1:45:3,255
<i>And the prints of two nails
were on his little feet.</i>


1385
1:45:3,255 --> 1:45:7,626
<i>'Who hath dared to wound thee? '
Cried the giant.</i>


1386
1:45:7,626 --> 1:45:11,496
<i>'Tell me, that I may take
my big sword and slay him. '</i>


1387
1:45:11,496 --> 1:45:13,832
<i>'Nay, 'answered the child.</i>


1388
1:45:13,832 --> 1:45:24,743
<i>'For these are
the wounds of love. "'</i>


1389
1:45:24,743 --> 1:45:27,379
Bosie thinks I'm jealous.


1390
1:45:27,379 --> 1:45:29,548
I think it will come as a shock
to Bosie to realize...


1391
1:45:29,548 --> 1:45:32,617
that even he is relatively unimportant
in the scheme of things.


1392
1:45:32,617 --> 1:45:36,721
But, no doubt, Bosie will be
remembered as long as Oscar...


1393
1:45:36,721 --> 1:45:43,929
unfortunately.


1394
1:45:43,929 --> 1:45:48,9
I sometimes wonder...


1395
1:45:48,9 --> 1:45:54,372
if I hadn't...


1396
1:45:54,372 --> 1:45:56,274
pushed him into...


1397
1:45:56,274 --> 1:45:59,244
Don't.


1398
1:45:59,244 --> 1:46:2,547
Oscar was very lucky
to meet you, Robbie.


1399
1:46:2,547 --> 1:46:5,584
Think who else
it might have been.


1400
1:46:5,584 --> 1:46:7,886
Oh, I'll have that one.
Thank you.


1401
1:46:7,886 --> 1:46:14,593
- Must you go abroad again at once?
- I shouldn't be here now.


1402
1:46:14,593 --> 1:46:17,729
But has he got anywhere to go
when he's released?


1403
1:46:17,729 --> 1:46:19,698
It'll have to be in France.


1404
1:46:19,698 --> 1:46:22,567
I'm going to see
what I can arrange.


1405
1:46:22,567 --> 1:46:24,87
But here...


1406
1:46:24,87 --> 1:46:32,844
when he leaves prison...


1407
1:46:32,844 --> 1:46:35,113
- Good-bye, Mr. Harris.
- Good-bye, sir.


1408
1:46:35,113 --> 1:46:43,522
Good-bye, Mr. Snow.
Thank you.


1409
1:46:43,522 --> 1:46:47,792
My dear Sphinx.


1410
1:46:47,792 --> 1:46:50,795
How marvelous of you to know what hat
to wear at 7:00 in the morning...


1411
1:46:50,795 --> 1:46:53,865
to meet a friend
who's been away.


1412
1:46:53,865 --> 1:46:56,902
- No, I'll keep this.
- What is it.


1413
1:46:56,902 --> 1:46:59,638
It's a letter to Bosie
telling him...


1414
1:46:59,638 --> 1:47:1,94
how I love him
but can never see him again.


1415
1:47:1,94 --> 1:47:4,976
I'm going to ask Robbie
to have it copied out before I send it.


1416
1:47:4,976 --> 1:47:8,446
I rather fear Bosie
might throw it on the fire.


1417
1:47:8,446 --> 1:47:46,952
<i>I call it De Profundis.
It comes from the very depths.</i>


1418
1:47:46,952 --> 1:47:49,487
<i>"I know not whether laws
be right...</i>


1419
1:47:49,487 --> 1:47:52,23
<i>or whether laws be wrong.</i>


1420
1:47:52,23 --> 1:47:54,259
<i>All that we know
who lie in jail...</i>


1421
1:47:54,259 --> 1:47:56,528
<i>is that the wall is strong...</i>


1422
1:47:56,528 --> 1:47:59,764
<i>and that each day
is like a year...</i>


1423
1:47:59,764 --> 1:48:6,871
<i>a year whose days are long.</i>


1424
1:48:6,871 --> 1:48:10,609
<i>Yet each man kills
the thing he loves.</i>


1425
1:48:10,609 --> 1:48:13,78
<i>By each, let this be heard.</i>


1426
1:48:13,78 --> 1:48:15,146
<i>Some do it with a bitter look...</i>


1427
1:48:15,146 --> 1:48:18,316
<i>some with a flattering word.</i>


1428
1:48:18,316 --> 1:48:20,885
<i>The coward does it
with a kiss...</i>


1429
1:48:20,885 --> 1:48:26,91
<i>the brave man with a sword.</i>


1430
1:48:26,91 --> 1:48:28,46
<i>Some kill their love
when they are young...</i>


1431
1:48:28,46 --> 1:48:31,396
<i>and some when they are old.</i>


1432
1:48:31,396 --> 1:48:34,799
<i>Some strangle
with the hands of lust...</i>


1433
1:48:34,799 --> 1:48:37,702
<i>some with the hands of gold.</i>


1434
1:48:37,702 --> 1:48:40,705
<i>The kindest use a knife...</i>


1435
1:48:40,705 --> 1:48:52,15
<i>because the dead
so soon grow cold. "</i>


1436
1:48:52,15 --> 1:48:57,956
I'm sure we can find
an hotel near here.


1437
1:48:57,956 --> 1:49:8,333
Somewhere where you can work.


1438
1:49:8,333 --> 1:49:12,904
- I've decided to see him again, Robbie.
- Yes.


1439
1:49:12,904 --> 1:49:17,242
- I thought you might.
- I've nothing left.


1440
1:49:17,242 --> 1:49:19,778
I've lost my wife.


1441
1:49:19,778 --> 1:49:23,782
I've lost my children.


1442
1:49:23,782 --> 1:49:27,385
They won't allow me
to see them now.


1443
1:49:27,385 --> 1:49:29,32
No one will ever read
my plays or books again.


1444
1:49:29,32 --> 1:49:31,22
Yes, they will.


1445
1:49:31,22 --> 1:49:36,461
Bosie loves me more
than he loves anyone else...


1446
1:49:36,461 --> 1:49:38,73
as much as he can love...


1447
1:49:38,73 --> 1:49:45,336
and allow himself to be loved.


1448
1:49:45,336 --> 1:49:50,809
I think we need
some more wine.


1449
1:49:50,809 --> 1:49:54,45
I find that alcohol...


1450
1:49:54,45 --> 1:50:0,385
taken in
sufficient quantities...


1451
1:50:0,385 --> 1:50:47,65
Can bring about
all the effects of drunkenness.


1452
1:50:47,65 --> 1:50:48,8
<i>"Life cheats us with shadows.</i>


1453
1:50:48,8 --> 1:50:52,437
<i>We ask it for pleasure.
It gives it to us...</i>


1454
1:50:52,437 --> 1:50:55,874
<i>with bitterness
and disappointment in its train.</i>


1455
1:50:55,874 --> 1:50:59,11
<i>And we find ourselves looking
with dull heart of stone...</i>


1456
1:50:59,11 --> 1:51:1,346
<i>at the tress
of gold-flecked hair...</i>


1457
1:51:1,346 --> 1:51:4,82
<i>that we had once
so wildly worshipped...</i>


1458
1:51:4,82 --> 1:51:42,754
<i>and so madly kissed. "</i>


1459
1:51:42,754 --> 1:51:46,491
<i>In this world, there are
only two tragedies.</i>


1460
1:51:46,491 --> 1:51:48,827
<i>One is not getting
what one wants.</i>


1461
1:51:48,827 --> 1:53:48,827
<i>The other is getting it.</i>
