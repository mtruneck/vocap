her if tue has other names?

0:13:26,59 --> 0:13:36,622



221
0:13:36,622 --> 0:13:39,27
HAMILTON MORRIS: She leads us
through her house, and then


222
0:13:39,27 --> 0:13:41,77
out to her garden of
medicinal plants.


223
0:13:41,77 --> 0:13:45,626
She brings us to a plant and
tells us that is tue.


224
0:13:45,626 --> 0:13:47,61
This is the tue, I'm assuming.


225
0:13:47,61 --> 0:13:50,19
Some people are calling it the
Colombian Devil's Breath.


226
0:13:50,19 --> 0:13:53,52
They call it a Angel's Trumpet,
Devil's Trumpet.


227
0:13:53,52 --> 0:13:55,7
It's the deliriant that
will give me a


228
0:13:55,7 --> 0:13:56,97
miserable nightmare trip.


229
0:13:56,97 --> 0:14:0,29
And this is what the shaman was
telling me that I needed


230
0:14:0,29 --> 0:14:4,2
to get, was this Devil's
Trumpet stuff.


231
0:14:4,2 --> 0:14:7,68
It's good we cleared that up and
he didn't have any on him


232
0:14:7,68 --> 0:14:9,57
at the time because that
would have been really


233
0:14:9,57 --> 0:14:10,73
unfortunate for me.


234
0:14:10,73 --> 0:14:13,68
She then brings me to another
corner of her garden, where we


235
0:14:13,68 --> 0:14:15,93
see a small tree with
lush, green leaves.

HAMILTON MORRIS: Fantastic.


239
0:14:21,653 --> 0:14:28,36
This is the chacruna, or
psychotria viridis plant.


240
0:14:28,36 --> 0:14:33,38
It contains DMT and pretty
much nothing else.


241
0:14:33,38 --> 0:14:37,334
This is, I think, the
gold standard for


242
0:14:37,334 --> 0:14:40,92
ayahuasca and brewing.


243
0:14:40,92 --> 0:14:44,44
We pay for the chacruna, and
leave for our hotel with all


244
0:14:44,44 --> 0:14:46,11
the ingredients needed
to brew ayahuasca.


245
0:14:46,11 --> 0:14:51,1



246
0:14:51,1 --> 0:14:53,25
Our hotel was nice enough to
let me use their kitchen


247
0:14:53,25 --> 0:14:55,42
brewing ayahuasca for the
rest of the afternoon.


248
0:14:55,42 --> 0:15:4,96



249
0:15:4,96 --> 0:15:9,416
In two hours I'll strain
what's left, and


250
0:15:9,416 --> 0:15:10,68
that will be that.


251
0:15:10,68 --> 0:15:13,63



252
0:15:13,63 --> 0:15:17,75
Here we are at our hotel room
in Tabatinga, and I just


253
0:15:17,75 --> 0:15:19,185
finished brewing
the ayahuasca.


254
0:15:19,185 --> 0:15:21,81
This is the MAOI, it's
the ayahuasca vine.


255
0:15:21,81 --> 0:15:23,95
Definitely the worst thing I've
ever tasted, and I've


256
0:15:23,95 --> 0:15:26,78
tasted a lot of terrible,
terrible drugs.


257
0:15:26,78 --> 0:15:30,98
But I'm going to try and get
through about half of this.


258
0:15:30,98 --> 0:15:32,23
Here I go.


259
0:15:32,23 --> 0:15:51,35



260
0:15:51,35 --> 0:15:52,6
Oh my God.


261
0:15:52,6 --> 0:15:58,34



262
0:15:58,34 --> 0:15:59,59
OK.


263
0:15:59,59 --> 0:16:13,57



264
0:16:13,57 --> 0:16:17,28
Little sips, it's too difficult
to swallow big ones.


265
0:16:17,28 --> 0:16:24,48



266
0:16:24,48 --> 0:16:27,12
Around sunset I start
drinking the vine.


267
0:16:27,12 --> 0:16:29,77
It's truly the most
awful-tasting substance on the


268
0:16:29,77 --> 0:16:33,73
planet, and each sip takes me
within a nano-gag of vomiting.


269
0:16:33,73 --> 0:16:38,22



270
0:16:38,22 --> 0:16:40,72
Sip, gag, sip, gag.


271
0:16:40,72 --> 0:16:43,63
The vine hits me like a
tsunami of warm milk.


272
0:16:43,63 --> 0:16:45,56
I've never been so drowsy
in my life.


273
0:16:45,56 --> 0:16:56,94



274
0:16:56,94 --> 0:16:58,7
I then drink the chacruna
leaves.


275
0:16:58,7 --> 0:17:1,65
I fall asleep and have strange,
apocalyptic dreams.


276
0:17:1,65 --> 0:17:9,4



277
0:17:9,4 --> 0:17:12,4
As I fall deeper into an
ayahuasca induced trance,


278
0:17:12,4 --> 0:17:16,79
strange visions and dark
premonitions overtake me.


279
0:17:16,79 --> 0:17:18,97
In the midst of these visions,
I realize that the sapo is


280
0:17:18,97 --> 0:17:22,74
only one amphibian enigma in
an endless jungle of mind


281
0:17:22,74 --> 0:17:24,41
altering mysteries.


282
0:17:24,41 --> 0:17:27,609
There's so much territory
left to explore--


283
0:17:27,609 --> 0:17:32,19
hypnotic giraffe bone marrow in
Sudan, sedative sea sponges


284
0:17:32,19 --> 0:17:36,96
in the Caribbean, dream fish of
the Pacific Ocean, narcotic


285
0:17:36,96 --> 0:17:39,99
silkworms in China, and unknown
synthetics from


286
0:17:39,99 --> 0:17:42,94
magical laboratories
across the globe.


287
0:17:42,94 --> 0:17:45,383
Whoa.


288
0:17:45,383 --> 0:17:46,826
Oh my God.


289
0:17:46,826 --> 0:17:56,47



290
0:17:56,47 --> 0:17:59,31
The ayahuasca makes me
extremely tired.


291
0:17:59,31 --> 0:18:3,57
I take a Ritalin to combat
the sleepiness.


292
0:18:3,57 --> 0:18:5,336
Yup.


293
0:18:5,336 --> 0:18:7,13
I guess it's time for a walk.


294
0:18:7,13 --> 0:18:11,72



295
0:18:11,72 --> 0:18:12,97
Coma juice.


296
0:18:12,97 --> 0:18:20,78



297
0:18:20,78 --> 0:18:24,265
It just made me into a thousand
year old man.


298
0:18:24,265 --> 0:18:39,792



299
0:18:39,792 --> 0:18:42,76
I got a boat.


300
0:18:42,76 --> 0:18:44,729
It's really just like
the boat we were in.


301
0:18:44,729 --> 0:18:54,39
It's the exact same boat, only
it's a lot more feathers than


302
0:18:54,39 --> 0:18:56,13
the boat we were on.


303
0:18:56,13 --> 0:18:58,72
And that's one hammock
in the middle--


304
0:18:58,72 --> 0:18:59,97
it's a one-person.


305
0:18:59,97 --> 0:19:22,4



306
0:19:22,4 --> 0:19:24,42
The frog was good.


307
0:19:24,42 --> 0:19:25,67
What's next?
