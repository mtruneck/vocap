###27 Films, we love 'em.

###38 SHANE SMITH: Narco cinema's a film genre coming out of
###40 Mexico, and it's just that.
###41 It's drugs meets films.
###43 The films have in them drug dealers, good cops, bad cops,
###46 cocaine, women, and trucks.
###48 [SIREN]
###51 [GUNFIRE]
###53 SHANE SMITH: Now we didn't know that much about narco
###54 cinema, and we didn't want to show up in Mexico not knowing
###57 anything about it, so we stopped off in North Austin,
###59 which is a big distribution point for
###60 narco cinema in America.
###62 And we went to a video store there and tried to get a
###64 primer on what narco cinema is all about.
###68 OK, so first of all, what is narco cinema?
###71 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: It's exactly that.
###72 Drugs, cinema.
###74 And it kind of ties into what's going on in
###76 Mexico right now.
###77 You have a lot of drug cartels trying to take over, the
###80 police department doesn't do this, that, and the other.
###82 So they're kind of making movies about that.
###84 SHANE SMITH: For example, "Coca, Inc."
###86 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: So there you go.
###87 SHANE SMITH: And you call narco cinema,
###89 also it's called videohome?
###91 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: Yeah, yeah, in Mexico,
###91 they call it videohome.
###92 SHANE SMITH: Videohome, because it goes straight to--
###94 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: It goes straight to video.
###95 Yeah.
###95 SHANE SMITH: So is this kind of a B-movie kind of thing?
###98 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: This is basically
###99 considered a B-movie.
###99 And basically, the biggest difference, of course, you're
###101 talking budget.
###102 SHANE SMITH: And is there one sort of standout hit, sort of
###105 the biggest narco cinema title?
###107 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: Basically the ones that have like a
###109 number five and a number six and a
###111 number seven, the sequels.
###113 SHANE SMITH: So "Dos Plebes."
###113 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: "Dos Plebes."
###115 Yeah, that's part five.
###116 SHANE SMITH: That's a big one.
###117 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: That's a big one.
###117 SHANE SMITH: That's a franchise.
###118 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: That's a franchise movie.
###119 SHANE SMITH: That's "Mission--
###120 Impossible."
###121 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: Pretty much.
###121 SHANE SMITH: OK.
###122 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: Anything with any type of a truck.
###124 SHANE SMITH: So the trucks are a big deal?
###125 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: The trucks are a big deal.
###126 Yeah, I'm sure it's--
###127 SHANE SMITH: "La Hummer Negra," "The Black Hummer."
###129 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: Yeah.
###130 SHANE SMITH: So here we have kind of a classic.
###133 This is actually the one that started the whole truck
###136 themes, "La Camioneta Gris," "The Grey Truck." And now, of
###141 course we go on to "La Ram Blanca," "La Hummer Negra,"
###145 "La Durango Roja." Now we have all of the different trucks.
###150 So hyperviolent, sexy, drug dealers, bad cops, and trucks.
###154 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: And trucks.
###154 SHANE SMITH: Narco cinema.
###155 EDUARDO BETANCOURT: Narco cinema.
###157 [GUNSHOT]
###158 [MUSIC - BOSTICH + FUSSIBLE, "NORTENA DEL SUR"]
###159 
###165 SHANE SMITH: We're here in the Zocalo, the main square in
###168 Mexico City.
###169 We're here because we're fascinated with Mexico and
###171 we're fascinated with drugs.
###174 "Vice" is all about sex, drugs, and rock and roll.
###176 And there's a lot of drugs around.
###178 Mexico produces the majority of the marijuana that comes
###182 into the States.
###182 The majority of meth in America is
###184 being made in Mexico.
###185 The majority of poppy that comes into the States from the
###187 south, and all of its derivatives.
###189 And it's the main superhighway of coke.
###194 It's about $100 billion business a year here.
###197 And 30% of that money is estimated to go into paying
###200 off the government and the police.
###202 Drugs as a culture have permeated every facet of
###205 Mexican society, where they'll have their own patron saints
###208 for drug trafficking and then we have narcocorridos, which
###211 is songs about being a drug trafficker.
###214 And they'll have movies, narco cinema, which we're
###217 going to check out.
###217 And we're going to get on the set.
###219 We're going to check out the guns, helicopters.
###220 We're going to shoot some people.
###222 And we're going to get involved as deeply as we can
###224 into the drug culture in Mexico.
###226 [MUSIC - BOSTICH + FUSSIBLE, "NORTENA DEL SUR"]
###227 
###231 SHANE SMITH: We're at about 10,000 feet now
###233 in a mountain pass.
###235 We're going two hours south of Mexico City to Cuernavaca,
###239 where we're going to meet Mario Almada.
###241 Mario Almada is 86 years old, and he's starred in more films
###245 than any other person alive today.
###247 [GUNFIRE]
###252 MARIO ALMADA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###252 SHANE SMITH: Most of them are narco cinema films, so we're
###255 going to ask him about narco cinema, how it gets funded,
###258 what they're about, how they get made.
###260 He's written them, he's directed them,
###262 he's starred in them.
###262 And although he's 86, he's still making them.
###266 He's kind of like the John Wayne of Mexico.
###268 Last night we tried the narco.
###271 Ouch.
###271 Today, we're going to try the cinema.
###273 Put 'em together, narco cinema.
###277 Can you tell us exactly how many films you've worked on?
###280 MARIO ALMADA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###281 
###335 SHANE SMITH: And do you usually play the good guy or
###337 the bad guy?
###338 MARIO ALMADA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###339 
###371 SHANE SMITH: So we left Senor Almada and headed back to
###373 Mexico City, where we really wanted to meet Jorge Reynoso.
###376 Now Jorge Reynoso is another big star of narco cinema,
###379 who's acted in 500-plus films.
###382 But unlike Almada, who plays the good guy, Reynoso always
###385 plays the badass.
###388 [GUNSHOT]
###388 SHANE SMITH: And we caught up to him when he was editing his
###391 latest film.
###393 JORGE REYNOSO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###394 
###427 SHANE SMITH: So you're saying that Mexicans celebrate their
###430 drug dealers?
###431 JORGE REYNOSO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###432 
###446 SHANE SMITH: Now I've heard that actually, some of these
###448 movies are financed by--
###450 MARIO ALMADA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###451 
###468 JORGE REYNOSO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###469 
###504 MARIO ALMADA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###505 
###525 SHANE SMITH: It was interesting to hear them talk
###527 about Caro Quintero, who in the '80s was one of the
###529 biggest drug dealers in Mexico, if not the world.
###532 In fact, he was so big that when they caught him, he
###535 offered to pay off the sum total of Mexicans' foreign
###538 debt if they let him go.
###540 They didn't let him go, and he's still in jail.
###543 Caro Quintero's a perfect example of the dichotomy that
###545 is narco cinema.
###546 Because on one side, they're making movies about him and
###548 celebrating him.
###549 On the other hand, he's a criminal who actually killed
###552 DEA agents and police and everybody else.
###555 And today, that's really evident, because the drug wars
###558 that are going on there, the narco
###559 wars, are out of control.
###560 I mean, when we were down there in Mexico, every day on
###563 the news, you hear about tortures and beheadings and
###566 killings and corruption.
###567 So not only are the cartels now warring with each other,
###571 there's a new government in that is trying to fight the
###573 corruption within its own government.
###574 This started sort of more violence.
###576 The cartels were fighting the government, the government
###578 were fighting the cartels, the cartels were
###579 fighting each other.
###581 So every day now, there's killings, and it's getting
###583 worse and worse and worse.
###585 In fact, 2008 was the worst year for violent crime in
###587 Mexican history.
###589 With 5,600 narco-related murders last year alone, the
###592 situation is totally fucked up.
###594 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###604 [CHEERING AND WHOOPING]
###608 SHANE SMITH: From the 1930s to the 1960s, Mexican cinema sort
###611 of mirrored what was going on in American cinema.
###613 It was a golden age, everything shot in black and
###615 white, everyone went to the theater.
###616 But then right around the '60s and '70s, they started making
###619 more B-movies, more campy stuff.
###621 El Santo, who's a very famous wrestler, started starring in
###625 these movies, and they were sort of about wrestling, and
###626 then people from outer space, and then all kinds of stuff.
###629 And along with the wrestling science fiction movies, there
###632 were the sexy comedies, which were kind of ribald romps
###635 through the dancing whorehouses of Mexico.
###638 And then in the '80s, there was a split between new
###640 Mexican cinema--
###641 "Like Water for Chocolate," for example, and videohome or
###645 narco cinema, which became increasingly about action,
###648 guns, trucks, cars, helicopters, explosions,
###651 women, and drugs.
###654 In fact, narco cinema's probably watched by more
###656 people than the standard or status-quo filmmaking that
###659 everybody knows, like "Y Tu Mama Tambien" or "Amores
###662 Perros," because a lot of people can't afford to go see
###664 films in the theater.
###666 So what percentage of the population can actually afford
###670 to go see films in Mexico?
###672 HUGO VILLA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###673 
###682 SHANE SMITH: So more people are seeing this subcultural
###685 cinema based on drug lore than are actually going to see
###688 movies in the theaters.
###689 So we became fascinated by it.
###691 At this point, all I could think about was, how do we get
###694 into one of these movies?
###695 Ooh, we should get outfits.
###696 
###699 We should really get outfits.
###702 If you wore those blue ones, would you be considered kind
###704 of a pussy, or a badass?
###706 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###707 
###710 I gotta get an outfit to be in narco cinema.
###714 I want to be in the movies.
###715 I'm gonna try to fit in.
###718 This is a good one.
###719 
###723 It's fake, right?
###725 SHANE SMITH: Oh, shit.
###726 
###730 SHANE SMITH: So who buys elephant-skin boots
###732 or manta ray belts?
###734 -[SPEAKING SPANISH]
###735 
###747 SHANE SMITH: How'm I doing?
###749 I think I'm fitting in.
###750 We're going to go check out some narcocorridos right now.
###754 Gonna try to fit in with them, maybe get a
###756 song sung about me.
###758 And then try to get in a movie.
###760 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###763 SHANE SMITH: So this is kind of like the hooker's walk, but
###766 instead of whores up and down the street, it's mariachis.
###769 And they'll run up to your car and they'll play a little
###771 quick lick for you on the guitar, and you'll go hire
###774 them for your party or for whatever you want to do with
###776 them, actually.
###777 We're gonna see if we can get some
###779 narcocorridos to sing about--
###780 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###782 
###786 [NARCOCORRIDOS PLAYING]
###795 -[SINGING IN SPANISH]
###797 
###815 SHANE SMITH: So I'm asking, what's a narcocorrido?
###818 Well, a corrido is a song, originally from the Mexican
###821 Revolution.
###822 But now a narcocorrido is a song about drug dealing.
###826 And what happens is if you're a big drug dealer, you go
###828 across the border with 100 kis, you come back and get a
###831 song written about you, saying, I'm the best drug
###833 dealer in town, man.
###834 My name is El Jefe Shane.
###836 So we're gonna hear some now, and I'm gonna get drunk.

###929 JORGE REYNOSO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###930 
###942 SHANE SMITH: It may seem like Jorge is making it sound a lot
###944 more dangerous than it actually is, but in fact, in
###947 the past three years, there's been 25 violent killings of
###950 musicians, most of which have been attributed to drug
###953 cartels, killing them for singing in the wrong territory
###956 or for singing about the wrong person.
###959 Now the most successful narco cinema film of all time, or
###962 the one that made the most money, is called "Chrysler
###964 300." And of course, it's based on a very popular
###967 narcocorrido.
###968 And what we found out there was, yes, these films are
###972 incredibly popular in videohome in Mexico.
###975 But where they make the most money is in America.
###977 In fact, "Chrysler 300" made all its money from selling in
###980 Walmart in the States.
###981 So we called the guys from "Chrysler 300," and they said,
###984 hey, we're actually filming parts two and three in
###987 Tijuana right now.
###988 Do you want to come down?
###989 And would you like to be in the movie?
###991 And we said, yes, please.
###993 [MUSIC - NORTEC COLLECTIVE, "TIJUANA SOUND MACHINE"]
###994 
###1001 SHANE SMITH: Now most people think that Cinco de Mayo is
###1003 the big party night in Mexico.
###1004 Nothing can be further from the truth.
###1006 In fact, the real party night is the celebration of the
###1009 independence from Spain, which is on September 16.
###1012 We arrived in TJ on September 16, and TJ was in full swing.
###1016 I mean, it was party, it was crazy, it was food and booze
###1019 and music everywhere.
###1021 But while we were partying in TJ, we heard that in Morelia,
###1024 another town in Mexico, that the Zetas, who are actually
###1027 the army of the Gulf Cartel, had just started lobbing
###1030 grenades into the crowd during Independence Day celebrations.
###1032 And they killed eight people and injured hundreds.
###1037 So this is the type of atmosphere--
###1038 party, fear, tension---
###1041 as we arrive to shoot parts two and three of "Chrysler
###1044 300."
###1044 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1051 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1057 [MUSIC - NORTEC COLLECTIVE, "TIJUANA SOUND MACHINE"]
###1058 
###1066 SHANE SMITH: So we're here in Tijuana, the epicenter of
###1068 narco cinema.
###1069 We're going to be shooting tonight.
###1070 We're going to be getting in some trouble.
###1072 We're in front of a whorehouse.
###1074 Narco cinema.
###1076 Our man in Tijuana was actually one of the biggest
###1078 directors in the videohome industry.
###1080 His name is Enrique Murillo.
###1082 ENRIQUE MURILLO: Hi.
###1083 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1084 
###1117 SHANE SMITH: I think the best thing about being involved in
###1119 a narco cinema film is realizing how much fun they
###1122 are to make.
###1123 They write their scripts on the fly.
###1124 They shoot the whole thing in a couple weeks, so it's just
###1127 bang, bang, bang, bang.
###1128 The locations are all real.
###1129 If you want to shoot in a whorehouse, you go to a
###1131 whorehouse.
###1131 If you want to shoot in a cop shop, you go to a cop shop.
###1134 So are you guys real cops?
###1136 Or--
###1136 -I have a security company.
###1138 And this is the reason we can provide all these gadgets.
###1142 SHANE SMITH: So you have the security business, and on the
###1145 side, acting.
###1147 Action.
###1148 -Yeah.
###1150 JORGE REYNOSO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1151 
###1173 SHANE SMITH: You know what?
###1174 They'll take anybody.
###1175 They took our cameraman, who ended up getting shot, and the
###1177 director's like, oh, he died so well.
###1179 He was such a good actor.
###1181 They took Santi, our producer, and put him
###1183 in the film as well.
###1185 -[SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1186 
###1189 SHANE SMITH: And action.
###1191 [MACHINE GUN FIRE]
###1194 
###1197 JORGE REYNOSO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1198 
###1222 ENRIQUE MURILLO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1223 
###1237 SHANE SMITH: The shooting of a narco cinema film is sort of
###1239 an exercise in logic.
###1241 It's like, hey, we want to have a gun scene where this
###1243 guy gets shot.
###1244 OK, well, shoot him.
###1246 Just shoot him with a paintball full of red ink.
###1248 OK, great.
###1249 So they shoot him with a blank.
###1250 Bang, they shoot him at the same time
###1252 with a paintball gun.
###1253 Boom, he's shot.
###1254 Bang, on to the next shot.
###1256 And it costs you about $10.00
###1257 It's kind of genius.
###1258 And when we were watching them shoot this film, we kept on
###1261 thinking, look at Hollywood with its two-year-long shoots
###1263 and its $100-million budgets and its special
###1265 effects and its CGI.
###1267 You can go out and shoot a film in two weeks, and it kind
###1269 of looks great.
###1270 [GUNSHOT]
###1271 SHANE SMITH: So they took us to a garbage dump in 40-degree
###1274 heat, in one of the poorest neighborhoods of Tijuana,
###1276 where I waited all day to get shot.
###1278 And just as my scene was coming up, the director comes
###1280 and says, Shane, Shane, we have to go, we have to go.
###1282 We have to get to the whorehouse.
###1283 So they take us to the cathouse, but they haven't
###1285 hired any actresses to play the whores.
###1287 No problem.
###1288 They just go inside, say, hey, come out.
###1289 You want to be in a movie?
###1290 Give them $100 or whatever, we start shooting.
###1293 ENRIQUE MURILLO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1295 SHANE SMITH: Hi.
###1297 Shane.
###1299 SHANE SMITH: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1303 SHANE SMITH: Actually, being in the film was quite funny,
###1304 because they move so fast.
###1306 It's just like, you're an American cowboy.
###1307 You're pissed off.
###1308 You come out of here.
###1309 Do it on three, go.
###1310 And you kind of feel like Brando.
###1312 You're like, well, what's my emotion?
###1313 What's my range?
###1314 What's my motivation?
###1316 But actually, you don't know what the hell you're doing,
###1318 and you're just trying to hit your mark on time while the
###1320 guns hit your face.
###1321 ENRIQUE MURILLO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1323 
###1329 SHANE SMITH: Hey!
###1330 What the fuck is going--
###1331 -[SPEAKING SPANISH]
###1332 SHANE SMITH: Whoa, whoa, no problemo, no problemo, man.
###1337 By the time the guns get out of your face and you're out of
###1339 the scene, you're like, whew, glad we got through that.
###1342 Didn't show my acting skills very much, but it was a hell
###1346 of a lot of fun.
###1347 ENRIQUE MURILLO: Thank you.
###1347 SHANE SMITH: Thanks, buddy.
###1348 ENRIQUE MURILLO: Thank you, my friend.
###1348 It's a pleasure.
###1349 My pleasure.
###1350 SHANE SMITH: It's my pleasure.
###1351 Thank you very much.
###1352 ENRIQUE MURILLO: OK, thank you.
###1353 SHANE SMITH: So that's our narco cinema wrapped.
###1356 We gotta go back to the States now.
###1359 So we had a lot of fun making the narco cinema film.
###1362 But on the flight back, we read that 40 people had been
###1365 killed in Tijuana that week alone, and it
###1368 kind of sobered us.
###1369 And we thought, well, as long as there's a huge demand for
###1372 drugs in America, there's going to be blood, drugs, and
###1376 these kind of movies flowing out of Mexico.
###1379 [MUSIC PLAYING]
