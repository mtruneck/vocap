1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:12,746



2
0:0:12,746 --> 0:0:15,41
FRANK CASTRONOVO: But we're
getting our After A Hard Day's


3
0:0:15,41 --> 0:0:17,27
Work drink.


4
0:0:17,27 --> 0:0:18,81
I think we should put some of
these in our pockets, because


5
0:0:18,81 --> 0:0:21,24
when we leave here, we won't be
able to get that anymore.


6
0:0:21,24 --> 0:0:23,73
FRANK FALCINELLI: I've got a
denim jacket that has pockets


7
0:0:23,73 --> 0:0:24,1
on the inside.


8
0:0:24,1 --> 0:0:25,59
FRANK CASTRONOVO: I brought my
jacket with all the pockets so


9
0:0:25,59 --> 0:0:26,58
I can put shit in there.


10
0:0:26,58 --> 0:0:31,312
This is Frank Castronovo
of Frankies Spuntino.


11
0:0:31,312 --> 0:0:32,74
Do you want to do that?


12
0:0:32,74 --> 0:0:34,71
FRANK FALCINELLI: Frank
Falcinelli.


13
0:0:34,71 --> 0:0:35,96
Frank Castronovo.


14
0:0:35,96 --> 0:0:37,9



15
0:0:37,9 --> 0:0:38,74
All right.


16
0:0:38,74 --> 0:0:39,99
Here we go.


17
0:0:39,99 --> 0:0:44,29



18
0:0:44,29 --> 0:0:48,39
Our idea, our concept was just
to attract the least amount of


19
0:0:48,39 --> 0:0:49,94
attention as possible.


20
0:0:49,94 --> 0:0:50,94
That was pretty much it.


21
0:0:50,94 --> 0:0:52,31
FRANK CASTRONOVO: We kind
of fly under the radar.


22
0:0:52,31 --> 0:0:55,6
FRANK FALCINELLI: Yeah, be out
in Brooklyn and just fix up a


23
0:0:55,6 --> 0:0:57,81
place nice and get back to
the stuff that we ate


24
0:0:57,81 --> 0:0:59,14
when we were kids.


25
0:0:59,14 --> 0:1:2,43
In chronological order, our
restaurants are Frankies


26
0:1:2,43 --> 0:1:6,34
Spuntino on Court Street,
Frankies Spuntino on Clinton


27
0:1:6,34 --> 0:1:11,1
Street, Cafe Pedlar, Prime Meats
right next to us on 465


28
0:1:11,1 --> 0:1:11,56
Court Street.


29
0:1:11,56 --> 0:1:12,57
FRANK CASTRONOVO: Last
but not least.


30
0:1:12,57 --> 0:1:13,62
FRANK FALCINELLI: Last
but not least.


31
0:1:13,62 --> 0:1:18,756
We're in Carroll Gardens heading
over to Roberta's.


32
0:1:18,756 --> 0:1:20,506
FRANK CASTRONOVO: When you want
to feel relaxed, you want


33
0:1:20,506 --> 0:1:27,42
to just kick back your feet,
take off your shoes.


34
0:1:27,42 --> 0:1:29,68
FRANK FALCINELLI: Roll
something delicious.


35
0:1:29,68 --> 0:1:30,86
FRANK CASTRONOVO: We're
going to spread


36
0:1:30,86 --> 0:1:32,53
the joy and the cheer.


37
0:1:32,53 --> 0:1:33,88
They've got sick pizza
here, man.


38
0:1:33,88 --> 0:1:48,481



39
0:1:48,481 --> 0:1:50,392
FRANK FALCINELLI: Cheer's man.


40
0:1:50,392 --> 0:1:51,9
FRANK CASTRONOVO: Prost.


41
0:1:51,9 --> 0:1:52,84
-The Frankie story?


42
0:1:52,84 --> 0:1:55,385
Well, these two guys grew
up together in Queens.


43
0:1:55,385 --> 0:1:56,9
FRANK CASTRONOVO: Probably
like 13.


44
0:1:56,9 --> 0:1:58,53
FRANK FALCINELLI: Yeah,
12, 13 years old.


45
0:1:58,53 --> 0:2:0,28
FRANK CASTRONOVO: Frank went to
culinary school like right


46
0:2:0,28 --> 0:2:1,21
after high school.


47
0:2:1,21 --> 0:2:2,61
And I ran into him.


48
0:2:2,61 --> 0:2:4,3
And I was like, where
are you at, man?


49
0:2:4,3 --> 0:2:5,985
And he was like, I'm
working at Maxines.


50
0:2:5,985 --> 0:2:9,33
And I was like, fuck, I've got
to get out of Queens, man.


51
0:2:9,33 --> 0:2:10,72
How the fuck am I going
to get out of here?


52
0:2:10,72 --> 0:2:14,32
And he's like, oh yeah
you travel a lot.


53
0:2:14,32 --> 0:2:15,2
You could be a chef.


54
0:2:15,2 --> 0:2:16,72
You could work in any country
in the world.


55
0:2:16,72 --> 0:2:20,28
And I always loved to travel
and go places and that was


56
0:2:20,28 --> 0:2:21,14
like my ticket.


57
0:2:21,14 --> 0:2:24,885
Thinking someday, you know
I've got to do something.


58
0:2:24,885 --> 0:2:27,17
Why don't I open a restaurant?


59
0:2:27,17 --> 0:2:27,92
I love to eat.


60
0:2:27,92 --> 0:2:30,36
I go to everybody's
house to eat, man.


61
0:2:30,36 --> 0:2:32,8
I was invited to everybody's
lunch and


62
0:2:32,8 --> 0:2:33,86
everybody's dinner, man.


63
0:2:33,86 --> 0:2:36,66
I thought I was going to be 55
years old and have a little


64
0:2:36,66 --> 0:2:39,416
restaurant with my
wife and my kids.


65
0:2:39,416 --> 0:2:41,1
And we were just going to
have a little thing.


66
0:2:41,1 --> 0:2:41,86
And Frank said, uh uh.


67
0:2:41,86 --> 0:2:42,75
It's happening now.


68
0:2:42,75 --> 0:2:44,83
We're doing it now.


69
0:2:44,83 --> 0:2:47,31
Whoa.


70
0:2:47,31 --> 0:2:50,38
FRANK FALCINELLI: The one thing
that's awesome about


71
0:2:50,38 --> 0:2:53,3
being in the restaurant
business and coming to


72
0:2:53,3 --> 0:2:55,74
restaurants, you can order like
a salad and then you get


73
0:2:55,74 --> 0:2:57,96
40 entrees.


74
0:2:57,96 --> 0:3:2,79
If you're working like 90 hours
and you're incessantly


75
0:3:2,79 --> 0:3:5,45
worrying about your business,
the least you can do is go to


76
0:3:5,45 --> 0:3:8,7
another restaurant and get
a bunch of free shit.


77
0:3:8,7 --> 0:3:10,17
This is like restaurant merch.


78
0:3:10,17 --> 0:3:11,94
They are like, hey, have another
one of my t-shirts.


79
0:3:11,94 --> 0:3:16,275



80
0:3:16,275 --> 0:3:17,28
FRANK FALCINELLI: But
we've got to go


81
0:3:17,28 --> 0:3:18,843
outside and smoke, man.


82
0:3:18,843 --> 0:3:21,148
Where's that smoke
coming from, man?


83
0:3:21,148 --> 0:3:22,54
Oh, my goodness.


84
0:3:22,54 --> 0:3:26,38
And Roberta's crew has now
ingested more THC than they've


85
0:3:26,38 --> 0:3:27,7
ever ingested.


86
0:3:27,7 --> 0:3:30,7
So, we're going to see Mathieu
at Motorino now.


87
0:3:30,7 --> 0:3:34,399



88
0:3:34,399 --> 0:3:36,87
MATHIEU PALOMBINO: Welcome
to Motorino.


89
0:3:36,87 --> 0:3:42,756
And it's a great honor to
have the Frankies here.


90
0:3:42,756 --> 0:3:46,37
FRANK CASTRONOVO: Mathieu
from Motorino--


91
0:3:46,37 --> 0:3:48,2
FRANK FALCINELLI: Is a
classically trained chef.


92
0:3:48,2 --> 0:3:48,804
FRANK CASTRONOVO:
He's like us.


93
0:3:48,804 --> 0:3:50,17
He's more of a classically
trained chef.


94
0:3:50,17 --> 0:3:51,8
We talk food.


95
0:3:51,8 --> 0:3:55,63
And he knows more than
just making pizza.


96
0:3:55,63 --> 0:3:58,57
And he's also similar
to us starting out.


97
0:3:58,57 --> 0:4:1,455
Just kind of doing like very
simple things, but doing them


98
0:4:1,455 --> 0:4:2,1
really well.


99
0:4:2,1 --> 0:4:5,23
Just focusing on the quality of
the product and not trying


100
0:4:5,23 --> 0:4:7,46
to do everything
that he knows.


101
0:4:7,46 --> 0:4:9,69
FRANK FALCINELLI: We share the
same hospitality aesthetic


102
0:4:9,69 --> 0:4:12,88
that we have as far as really
making people feel


103
0:4:12,88 --> 0:4:14,51
comfortable.


104
0:4:14,51 --> 0:4:16,91
A little bit more than buying
them a drink type of thing.


105
0:4:16,91 --> 0:4:18,29
It's just real, you know--


106
0:4:18,29 --> 0:4:19,79
you feel like you want
to be part of that.


107
0:4:19,79 --> 0:4:22,68
And they want to be part of your
life while you're there


108
0:4:22,68 --> 0:4:23,73
and away from there.


109
0:4:23,73 --> 0:4:25,86
And it's just a bond
that carries on.


110
0:4:25,86 --> 0:4:27,11
They call it roasted
mortadella,


111
0:4:27,11 --> 0:4:29,8
but it's fried baloney.


112
0:4:29,8 --> 0:4:30,18
It is.


113
0:4:30,18 --> 0:4:31,62
That's fried fucking baloney.


114
0:4:31,62 --> 0:4:35,205



115
0:4:35,205 --> 0:4:35,66
Yep.


116
0:4:35,66 --> 0:4:37,8
He throws the kitchen
sink at you.


117
0:4:37,8 --> 0:4:38,57
That's the shit right there.


118
0:4:38,57 --> 0:4:47,7



119
0:4:47,7 --> 0:4:48,825
We're definitely doing a lot
of different projects.


120
0:4:48,825 --> 0:4:51,66
But we're trying to keep the
pace steady and even.


121
0:4:51,66 --> 0:4:55,66
"The Frankies Spuntino Kitchen
Companion and Cooking Manual."


122
0:4:55,66 --> 0:4:57,64
That's going to be
out in June.


123
0:4:57,64 --> 0:4:59,82
Somebody's got to be interested
in how to make the


124
0:4:59,82 --> 0:5:2,65
damn gnocchi or how to make the
cavatelli or how to make


125
0:5:2,65 --> 0:5:4,33
the white onion dressing.


126
0:5:4,33 --> 0:5:6,57
It stays true to the fact that
it is a cooking manual.


127
0:5:6,57 --> 0:5:9,48
It's meant to stay on the
kitchen counter at all times


128
0:5:9,48 --> 0:5:10,88
so that's your go-to book.


129
0:5:10,88 --> 0:5:12,79
Getting down with some
delicious, delicious--


130
0:5:12,79 --> 0:5:15,102
Cheers.


131
0:5:15,102 --> 0:5:18,9
Cheers man.


132
0:5:18,9 --> 0:5:20,85
FRANK CASTRONOVO: We're
leaving Williamsburg.


133
0:5:20,85 --> 0:5:23,16
And we're heading back
to Carroll Gardens.


134
0:5:23,16 --> 0:5:25,12
FRANK FALCINELLI: We
kidnapped Mathieu.


135
0:5:25,12 --> 0:5:31,1



136
0:5:31,1 --> 0:5:34,0
The menu is very solid.


137
0:5:34,0 --> 0:5:35,37
And all the dishes--


138
0:5:35,37 --> 0:5:38,66
when you take a dish off, you
get like an uproar and say,


139
0:5:38,66 --> 0:5:40,81
why are you taking that out?


140
0:5:40,81 --> 0:5:43,7
Something basic, like
our meatballs.


141
0:5:43,7 --> 0:5:45,43
That's everything
everybody wants


142
0:5:45,43 --> 0:5:46,49
to know about, meatballs.


143
0:5:46,49 --> 0:5:48,89
So let's make a meatball.


144
0:5:48,89 --> 0:5:50,695
It can't be that hard.


145
0:5:50,695 --> 0:5:54,61



146
0:5:54,61 --> 0:5:58,137
FRANK CASTRONOVO: We're doing
meatballs Frankie style.


147
0:5:58,137 --> 0:5:59,387
FRANK FALCINELLI: Parsley.


148
0:5:59,387 --> 0:6:5,9



149
0:6:5,9 --> 0:6:6,4
OK, two cups of bread.


150
0:6:6,4 --> 0:6:12,78



151
0:6:12,78 --> 0:6:14,3
Plenty.


152
0:6:14,3 --> 0:6:23,97



153
0:6:23,97 --> 0:6:26,92
FRANK CASTRONOVO: We're
making meatballs.


154
0:6:26,92 --> 0:6:31,311
That is some nice looking
browning Frank Falcinelli.


155
0:6:31,311 --> 0:6:34,9
You have to nice and slowly
brown everything with a lot of


156
0:6:34,9 --> 0:6:35,79
love and care.


157
0:6:35,79 --> 0:6:38,14
Tell you, chefs are like, don't
cook with olive oil,


158
0:6:38,14 --> 0:6:40,3
don't cook high-- yeah, you
don't go over a certain


159
0:6:40,3 --> 0:6:41,38
temperature.


160
0:6:41,38 --> 0:6:46,14
Keep it like at 110, 120 like
Frank's doing right now.


161
0:6:46,14 --> 0:6:46,59
All right, Frank.


162
0:6:46,59 --> 0:6:47,992
Let's go grab a bottle
of wine.


163
0:6:47,992 --> 0:6:56,83



164
0:6:56,83 --> 0:6:58,43
FRANK FALCINELLI: Um, let
me read French braille.


165
0:6:58,43 --> 0:6:59,943
Yes, it's very easy in braille.


166
0:6:59,943 --> 0:7:1,89
Ooh, yeah.


167
0:7:1,89 --> 0:7:3,8
FRANK CASTRONOVO: So, bascailly,
this is more like a


168
0:7:3,8 --> 0:7:10,3
hamburger in tomato sauce with
garlic and Parmesan cheese.


169
0:7:10,3 --> 0:7:12,93
It's really tasty like that.


170
0:7:12,93 --> 0:7:14,18
So, here we go.


171
0:7:14,18 --> 0:7:16,39



172
0:7:16,39 --> 0:7:19,25
Now, you can see the meat just
reached tempreture, so it's


173
0:7:19,25 --> 0:7:21,7
still really tender.


174
0:7:21,7 --> 0:7:23,662
You just put a little
sauce around it.


175
0:7:23,662 --> 0:7:25,8
Put sauce on top of it.


176
0:7:25,8 --> 0:7:27,252
Put a little cheese on that.


177
0:7:27,252 --> 0:7:28,22
FRANK FALCINELLI: It
looks good, man.


178
0:7:28,22 --> 0:7:28,81
FRANK CASTRONOVO: It's fresh.


179
0:7:28,81 --> 0:7:30,6
It just got cooked.


180
0:7:30,6 --> 0:7:37,875



181
0:7:37,875 --> 0:7:39,125
Holy shit.


182
0:7:39,125 --> 0:7:42,761



183
0:7:42,761 --> 0:7:46,18
You know people here say,
he's a fucking cook.


184
0:7:46,18 --> 0:7:49,4
Or that's all he does,
but it's a lot more


185
0:7:49,4 --> 0:7:50,41
serious than that.


186
0:7:50,41 --> 0:7:53,48
We're putting food in
people's mouths.


187
0:7:53,48 --> 0:7:56,98
And It's not really about how
great we can be and how


188
0:7:56,98 --> 0:7:58,78
popular we can be and how
much money we can make.


189
0:7:58,78 --> 0:8:1,56
It's really about truly
believing that what you're


190
0:8:1,56 --> 0:8:3,87
doing is something good
and what you're doing


191
0:8:3,87 --> 0:8:5,38
is the right thing.


192
0:8:5,38 --> 0:8:9,0
Because when you die and you're
done, you're not taking


193
0:8:9,0 --> 0:8:12,22
anything with you except what
you did with your soul, how


194
0:8:12,22 --> 0:8:13,2
you enriched it.


195
0:8:13,2 --> 0:8:16,611
And that's why I always feel
like what I'm doing is good


196
0:8:16,611 --> 0:8:18,866
and right and true.


197
0:8:18,866 --> 0:8:23,84
Truthfully, I'd love to go out
being known as like be


198
0:8:23,84 --> 0:8:26,75
Grateful Dead of food.


199
0:8:26,75 --> 0:8:31,48
That would be like
my ultimate.


200
0:8:31,48 --> 0:8:33,38
That's what we're trying
to do here.


201
0:8:33,38 --> 0:8:36,37
You came just in time for
the final doobie, man.


202
0:8:36,37 --> 0:10:36,37
