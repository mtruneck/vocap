1
0:0:0,89 --> 0:0:1,979
At the same time whole forests are used to satisfy another European craving:


2
0:0:1,979 --> 0:0:10,829
for magnificent buildings.


3
0:0:10,829 --> 0:0:14,99
The cathedrals in the cities are made of stone.


4
0:0:14,99 --> 0:0:22,82
Yet they require millions of logs for their basis and frames.


5
0:0:22,82 --> 0:0:25,31
Larches are needed for roof supports.


6
0:0:25,31 --> 0:0:35,7
Solid logs of oak, alder and elm are sunk into the ground to create foundations.


7
0:0:35,7 --> 0:0:41,52
Wood is indispensable for pillars and ceilings, posts and roof panels.


8
0:0:41,52 --> 0:0:51,61
ax handles and cart wheels.


9
0:0:51,61 --> 0:0:57,69
European castles, cathedrals, monasteries and churches consumed entire forests


10
0:0:57,69 --> 0:1:8,29
in Germany, France, Italy, Spain and England.


11
0:1:8,29 --> 0:1:13,86
No wonder that all the great social and economic struggles in the Middle Ages


12
0:1:13,86 --> 0:1:17,88
are fought in the forests around the forests and about the forests.


13
0:1:17,88 --> 0:1:19,75
In this competition for timber


14
0:1:19,75 --> 0:1:22,43
those who have money make the rules.


15
0:1:22,43 --> 0:1:26,32
And the money is now in the cities.


16
0:1:26,32 --> 0:1:32,87
Perhaps the richest city of all is Venice.


17
0:1:32,87 --> 0:1:35,62
It's built on wood, literally.


18
0:1:35,62 --> 0:1:41,93
Piles sunk into the mud to create the platform on which the great stone faÃ§ades can float.


19
0:1:41,93 --> 0:1:50,64
But behind all this is commerce and a great maritime republic.


20
0:1:50,64 --> 0:1:55,36
The goods that are bought and sold are transported in wooden galleons.


21
0:1:55,36 --> 0:2:4,49
Venice has denuded the forests all around them to build its fleet.


22
0:2:4,49 --> 0:2:7,15
The city's demand is insatiable


23
0:2:7,15 --> 0:2:10,469
and they started to deplete the Alps.


24
0:2:10,469 --> 0:2:13,639
Spruce for masts, larch for planking,


25
0:2:13,639 --> 0:2:15,449
elm for capstans,


26
0:2:15,449 --> 0:2:20,839
walnut for rudders and most importantly oak for hulls.


27
0:2:20,839 --> 0:2:22,469
When that is not enough


28
0:2:22,469 --> 0:2:24,32
they cut a swath across Europe


29
0:2:24,32 --> 0:2:36,149
all the way to the Baltic.


30
0:2:36,149 --> 0:2:39,779
The Europeans have exploited their natural resources,


31
0:2:39,779 --> 0:2:41,84
leaving a continent where there are few fish in the rivers


32
0:2:41,84 --> 0:2:47,9
and less and less
timber in their forests.


33
0:2:47,9 --> 0:2:49,469
Their towns are crowded with people


34
0:2:49,469 --> 0:2:56,969
and they don't know what to do with them.


35
0:2:56,969 --> 0:3:2,169
Rivalries between princes and kings have grown intense.


36
0:3:2,169 --> 0:3:8,819
Religious fervour, curiosity and greed are widespread in 1491.


37
0:3:8,819 --> 0:3:13,159
And there's a constant hunger for new ideas.


38
0:3:13,159 --> 0:3:23,839
The printing press is invented, books and ideas spread.


39
0:3:23,839 --> 0:3:31,659
But where do they go from here?


40
0:3:31,659 --> 0:3:41,319
Where can all this raw energy be channeled?


41
0:3:41,319 --> 0:3:47,489
This is the time when European kings and queens send explorers beyond the horizon


42
0:3:47,489 --> 0:3:50,769
to expand and enhance their power.


43
0:3:50,769 --> 0:3:54,879
Some explorers go around Africa to find the sea route to India.


44
0:3:54,879 --> 0:4:3,59
One has the vision to sail west to arrive in the east.


45
0:4:3,59 --> 0:4:5,209
He's a seaman from Genoa, Italy.


46
0:4:5,209 --> 0:4:13,9
A fervent amateur who has the crazy idea of sailing into the unknown to reach India.


47
0:4:13,9 --> 0:4:17,139
Christopher Columbus has spent five years trying to gain royal support to


48
0:4:17,139 --> 0:4:23,229
finance his voyage.


49
0:4:23,229 --> 0:4:30,149
Isabella, queen of Spain, finally agrees. What does the Spanish crown have to lose?


50
0:4:30,149 --> 0:4:34,789
It doesn't cost much to finance three ships.


51
0:4:34,789 --> 0:4:40,23
Spain has so much to gain from a shortcut to India: treasures,


52
0:4:40,23 --> 0:4:41,729
trade,


53
0:4:41,729 --> 0:4:52,57
and land.


54
0:4:52,57 --> 0:4:53,319
At first


55
0:4:53,319 --> 0:4:57,589
no one wants to board his ship.


56
0:4:57,589 --> 0:5:2,919
Finally he drags together a motley crew of eighty-seven men.


57
0:5:2,919 --> 0:5:6,431
Many are illiterates, petty criminals, even murderous who


58
0:5:6,431 --> 0:5:11,94
choose probable death at sea in preference to the gallows.


59
0:5:11,94 --> 0:5:19,139
Many are soldiers with nothing to do since Spain expelled the Moors just months before.


60
0:5:19,139 --> 0:5:28,82
Now they are soldiers of fortune.


61
0:5:28,82 --> 0:5:35,729
With his band of desperadoes Christopher Columbus sets sail from the port of Seville.


62
0:5:35,729 --> 0:5:41,33
It is the summer of 1492.


63
0:5:41,33 --> 0:5:46,409
He promises the queen that his expedition will be a success.


64
0:5:46,409 --> 0:5:48,869
And in a matter of weeks


65
0:5:48,869 --> 0:6:17,75
he will change the course of history.


66
0:6:17,75 --> 0:6:28,33
It is October twelve 1492 when Columbus sights land.


67
0:6:28,33 --> 0:6:32,699
"I saw neither sheep, nor goats nor any other beasts.


68
0:6:32,699 --> 0:6:37,39
All the trees were as different from ours as day from night.


69
0:6:37,39 --> 0:6:44,769
And so the herbage, the rocks and all things."


70
0:6:44,769 --> 0:6:49,43
Three Spanish ships sailed west for three months in search of India.


71
0:6:49,43 --> 0:6:51,319
Then finally they arrived.


72
0:6:51,319 --> 0:6:54,789
Eighty-seven men, among them conquistadors,


73
0:6:54,789 --> 0:6:59,87
pig farmers, murderers.


74
0:6:59,87 --> 0:7:2,62
But this is not Asia.


75
0:7:2,62 --> 0:7:5,28
It is an island in the Caribbean.


76
0:7:5,28 --> 0:7:17,669
They have no idea that they have come to a new world.


77
0:7:17,669 --> 0:7:23,72
The air is hot, water is warm.


78
0:7:23,72 --> 0:7:26,69
They have survived the voyage and have found land


79
0:7:26,69 --> 0:7:27,75
for the Spanish crown.


80
0:7:27,75 --> 0:7:30,759
And in the name of God.


81
0:7:30,759 --> 0:7:47,6
They are exhausted, tired, but thankful.


82
0:7:47,6 --> 0:7:50,139
What land is this?


83
0:7:50,139 --> 0:7:52,17
Where are the ports, the cities,


84
0:7:52,17 --> 0:7:58,449
the ships and traders they expected?


85
0:7:58,449 --> 0:8:1,559
The natives have seen many people arrive from the sea.


86
0:8:1,559 --> 0:8:2,849
Other tribes,


87
0:8:2,849 --> 0:8:54,1
but no one like this.


88
0:8:54,1 --> 0:8:55,62
They will both soon discover


89
0:8:55,62 --> 0:9:1,34
that this is just the beginning.


90
0:9:1,34 --> 0:9:5,1
Columbus and his men stay for three months in the Bahamas


91
0:9:5,1 --> 0:9:12,51
and have no idea that they are on the edge of two great continents.


92
0:9:12,51 --> 0:9:23,34
About ten times bigger than Europe.


93
0:9:23,34 --> 0:9:26,5
From the tropical seas


94
0:9:26,5 --> 0:9:31,95
to the arid deserts.


95
0:9:31,95 --> 0:9:37,44
It is vast


96
0:9:37,44 --> 0:9:40,98
and there is space,


97
0:9:40,98 --> 0:9:44,98
with room for every possible landscape.


98
0:9:44,98 --> 0:9:47,13
Stretching from the northernmost


99
0:9:47,13 --> 0:9:54,22
almost to the southernmost points of the globe.


100
0:9:54,22 --> 0:10:3,3
Spain's ** monarchy made Columbus's voyage possible.


101
0:10:3,3 --> 0:10:4,81
It is 1493


102
0:10:4,81 --> 0:10:12,36
and they've waited eagerly for seven months to learn of his discoveries.


103
0:10:12,36 --> 0:10:22,75
Upon his return he delivers the news and reports to Queen Isabella.


104
0:10:22,75 --> 0:10:24,6
In a few pages


105
0:10:24,6 --> 0:10:30,36
Columbus describes the paradise he has found in her name.


106
0:10:30,36 --> 0:10:32,8
Land to conquer,


107
0:10:32,8 --> 0:10:34,17
converts for Christianity


108
0:10:34,17 --> 0:10:42,17
riches to exploit, and gold.


109
0:10:42,17 --> 0:10:48,96
In Europe no news stays local for long.


110
0:10:48,96 --> 0:10:55,0
Traders, armies and pilgrims carry news across the continent in weeks.


111
0:10:55,0 --> 0:11:0,75
Columbus's letter is translated, copied and becomes a bestseller.


112
0:11:0,75 --> 0:11:8,8
Now many Europeans are aching for their share of the treasures.


113
0:11:8,8 --> 0:11:9,2
A few months later


114
0:11:9,2 --> 0:11:19,71
in Spain men are moving towards the ports of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.


115
0:11:19,71 --> 0:11:21,71
Men who have no land


116
0:11:21,71 --> 0:11:25,15
and no work.


117
0:11:25,15 --> 0:11:32,37
They cross the barren Spanish regions that offer little to live of.


118
0:11:32,37 --> 0:11:35,45
Desperadoes with nothing to lose.


119
0:11:35,45 --> 0:11:37,22
Men in need of a job.


120
0:11:37,22 --> 0:11:40,33
And the queen needs them.


121
0:11:40,33 --> 0:11:46,2
Anyone can come along, anyone can be a conquistador, even a pig farmer


122
0:11:46,2 --> 0:11:55,44
can win glory and riches in faraway lands.


123
0:11:55,44 --> 0:11:57,4
In 1493


124
0:11:57,4 --> 0:11:59,85
seventeen ships arrive in the new world


125
0:11:59,85 --> 0:12:2,13
on an island in the Caribbean Sea,


126
0:12:2,13 --> 0:12:5,48
carrying twelve hundred Spaniards.


127
0:12:5,48 --> 0:12:11,8
Columbus's second voyage begins a stampede of Spanish exploration and conquest.


128
0:12:11,8 --> 0:12:15,2
Some will go south, some to the Andes,


129
0:12:15,2 --> 0:12:17,5
some along the Mississippi.


130
0:12:17,5 --> 0:12:18,839
It is the conquest


131
0:12:18,839 --> 0:12:21,14
of the Americas.


132
0:12:21,14 --> 0:12:22,59
Driven by greed,


133
0:12:22,59 --> 0:12:23,96
carrying weapons


134
0:12:23,96 --> 0:12:25,31
and with one animal


135
0:12:25,31 --> 0:12:29,5
that does not exist on this continent.


136
0:12:29,5 --> 0:12:30,39
With the horse


137
0:12:30,39 --> 0:12:39,6
the Spanish are able to annihilate whole empires in just a few decades.


138
0:12:39,6 --> 0:12:41,1
Within forty years


139
0:12:41,1 --> 0:12:50,43
the Inca in the Andes fall to Pizarro.


140
0:12:50,43 --> 0:13:3,58
And the Aztecs in Central America to Cortez.


141
0:13:3,58 --> 0:13:10,45
Where there were towns and cities inhabited by millions of people,


142
0:13:10,45 --> 0:15:10,45
the Spaniards leave only ruins,
