###15 KEVIN JONES: That's one sick ass line.
###17 -[INAUDIBLE].
###19 KEVIN JONES: [INAUDIBLE].
###20 Get out of here, [INAUDIBLE]
###22 on the line.
###23 
###39 MATHIEU CREPEL: I think Kevin took freestyle snowboarding to
###43 another level.
###44 Like the thing that I remember most about Kevin was that
###47 first frontside 1080 in the back country.
###50 Nobody at that time thought it was possible, and
###53 then, boom, did it.
###55 And it was amazing.
###57 KEVIN JONES: And of course, whenever you do something, you
###60 don't know if you do it good or not.
###61 Because back in those days, you had to wait two weeks for
###65 film to be actually transferred.
###66 TIM MANNING: All of us filmers would shoot as much
###70 footage as we could.
###72 We get the film processed.
###73 The footage would come back in a VHS tape.
###76 And everybody would show up in Mike's family room.
###79 And you're sitting there biting your teeth hoping that
###82 that one shot you had in mind came out exactly the way you
###85 thought it would.
###85 And then Mike or David would be like, ah, kind of a bobble
###89 in the beginning, like you kind blew the shot.
###92 MIKE HATCHETT: Shooting film is a
###93 totally different monster.
###95 When you shoot film, you got to make it count, just like
###98 press the button and look at your shot, and go, oh, my
###101 framing's off.
###102 I wish I did that.
###103 Delete.
###104 So the film thing is definitely--
###107 you learn to be more conservative and press the
###110 button when you know you got your crap together.
###112 KEVIN JONES: I mean seriously I couldn't
###114 sleep, I couldn't eat.
###115 I was like, dude, if I blow my chance with these guys,
###119 because back then, that was it, if I fucking blow my
###122 chance with these dudes, I'm done, because it's money.
###127 MIKE HATCHETT: And this is what we used to shoot.
###129 It was 100-foot daylight loads, three minutes of
###133 footage, $1 a foot, so $100 every time you shoot this.
###137 So four rolls, one day of shooting.
###139 Just the shooting costs $400 for the one day.
###144 So we used to shoot on 16 millimeter.
###146 And this is all--
###149 what was it?
###149 Did we go to 2005?
###151 When did we stop shooting film?
###151 I think it was 2005.
###153 So this is basically 1989.
###155 And then, two years, I worked for Fall Line.
###156 And then, once we did "TB2" with Mack Dawg, all the way to
###160 2005, and these are stacked double, so they're always like
###165 twice as many in here as you can see right now.
###167 So yeah, it's kind of funny if you think about the past.
###169 When you stop to watch a trailer, we make a movie.
###172 And we make like the TV for a trailer.
###174 We put on VHS.
###176 And then, they sent out to the shops.
###177 And the only way to see the trailer is if you were in a
###179 shop, because there was no internet.
###182 And now, to watch a trailer, you just make one click, and
###187 you just watch it.
###187 A lot of people who are 15 years old right now are
###189 watching the movies don't realize you couldn't just
###191 click and watch something.
###192 You certainly couldn't just click to a BitTorrent, steal
###195 it for free.
###196 You had to buy it or put two VHS machines together
###200 obviously and copy a tape to tape.
###204 A lot has changed, that's for sure.
###205 DAVE HATCHETT: There's something cool about just
###206 making a DVD, and something you can hold in your hands,
###209 and the anticipation of waiting for that movie to come
###211 out, and see what all the writers did and if they can
###214 actually one up their segments from last year.
###216 And I think that really helps drive the
###217 progression of the sport.
###218 As much as I like the YouTube and all the free content out
###221 there, I really think it's important to kind of have at
###224 least one or two or three good movies out there a year that
###227 the kids can buy and watch that's not just a YouTube
###230 phenomenon.
###231 JUSSI OKSANEN: I think when I look back my snowboard career,
###234 I think I was very lucky to get in with those guys in the
###238 first place, because they're super
###240 professional and organized.
###243 We wake up pretty much four in the morning every day.
###246 AARON SEDWAY: You know, back in the day, it was always like
###248 pulling teeth to get the riders to get up that early.
###251 And I think it's still is these days.
###253 You know, they probably lose some riders too that don't
###256 want to always get up that early to get out there.
###259 But it's kind of what you got to do.
###262 JIM RIPPEY: If you want to be one of those guys, one of
###265 those snowboarders in those movies, it really all comes
###268 down to hard work.
###269 So you're up before it's even light, and you're getting
###272 together and heading out to where you've got to go.
###275 And usually, you got to hike through a lot of powder and
###277 get to your obstacle, fix your takeoff, get ready to do it.
###281 And then, when the light comes out, and it's good enough, be
###284 ready to go.
###284 MIKE HATCHETT: If you want to get some footage in the can,
###287 the sun comes up, and you only have from sun rise until about
###291 11:30 or noon to shoot, and everything goes in the shade.
###295 So yeah, it's all about the lighting, and caring about the
###297 lighting, and that's why we get up so early.
###299 JUSSI OKSANEN: A load of riders came by Mike's house,
###302 like they try to film for a standard movie.
###304 And then, they will get burnt out like in two weeks.
###309 They come and stay like a week, and
###311 they're like fuck this.
###313 This sucks.
###314 I don't want to wake up at four in the morning.
###316 TOM BURT: The nice thing about Standard, they had the
###320 willingness to put in the time and energy to go out
###323 there and be there.
###325 I'd say it's one of those things that has always set
###328 them apart.
###329 Now, a lot of people have pretty much copied what
###332 they've done.
###333 DAVE HATCHETT: To me, the best snowboarder film companies
###336 will always be the ones that show everything.
###338 I want to grab people segments, but I also want to
###341 see people talking.
###342 I want to see the guys break it down, and just really get
###345 to the feeling of what it's like to ride a snowboard and
###348 the thing that we all embrace and love about snowboarding,
###351 but really shows the cutting edge of what's going on.
###353 And I think, ultimately, the best snowboard movie has yet
###356 to be made.
###357 LONNIE KAUK: I think that's where all this
###358 film stuff's heading.
###359 It's not just like, oh, banger, banger, banger,
###361 banger, banger, stop.
###362 We know nothing about this person.
###365 Who is this guy?
###366 What does he feel?
###367 Does he go to the store?
###369 Does he like wash his clothes?
###372 Does he do the things that everybody does?
###376 Of course, so show it.
###378 Because really, I think with a video part, it's all about
###380 music and be able to capture that person.
###384 MATHIEU CREPEL: I've always loved snowboarding as like a
###389 global thing and not on the rail or not on the contest are
###393 not only filming or back country.
###395 I love to do everything.
###397 And I think this is the heart of Standard films.
###400 It's just like grab your board and try to show like what
###405 snowboarding means to me.
###406 And if it's like a rail, or park day, or
###410 [INAUDIBLE], just do it.
###411 And that's what I love in snowboarding because you get
###414 your stick.
###414 We got mountains.
###416 Go for it.
###416 Ride.
###417 MIKE HATCHETT: Rewind in 20 years.
###419 I didn't think I'd be sitting here now making a 20th video.
###423 For sure, the first couple years, I definitely didn't
###426 think we'd be getting to 20.
###428 When we got to 15, I was thinking there's a good chance
###430 we make it to 20.
###432 Or pretty much, when we got to 15, I knew I had
###433 to make it to 20.
###436 But yeah, I mean, I remember the first couple of years just
###440 being nervous we could even make a movie.
###442 Like are we going to have enough footage?
###445 It's not going to happen.
###446 We're not going to get enough--
###447 I would be so panicked.
###448 I'd stay up at night.
###450 And then, after like six or seven movies--
###452 I think it was actually after 10 movies, I finally realized,
###454 like you know what, you shoot all year, you make a movie.
###458 It might not be as good as the one the year before or it
###460 might be better.
###461 You're not always going to hit a home run, or maybe you're
###463 never going to hit a home run as far some people could say.
###466 If you shoot all year, you'll make a movie.
###468 
###477 KEVIN JONES: If you were to told me three years ago,
###479 you're going to be on TV, I would have laughed at you.
###483 The first film I filmed was "TB5." 15 years later, I'm
###488 still in a movie.
###490 And to be a part of this is seriously a dream come true.
###494 
###500 DAVE DOWNING: Well, I expect "TB20" to be a diverse,
###505 progressive snowboarding movie with some Alaska stuff in it,
###508 big mountain stuff, and some handrail stuff and jumps and
###511 everything.
###511 So I know Mike has always wanted it to be like that.
###515 And I hope that's what "TB20" is.
###517 I'm sure it will be.
###519 JEREMY JONES: Yeah, I'm definitely not surprised that
###522 Standard's still in the game making snowboarding movies.
###525 They have so much passion, so much knowledge, and still
###530 really love to get out there and tread.
###533 Yeah, the question is will be there a "TB30"?
