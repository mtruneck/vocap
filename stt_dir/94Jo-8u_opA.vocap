###17 CLEO: The morning after our U-Center debacle, we went back
###21 to Clichy Sous Bois to meet the kids, because they wanted
###23 to show us where they hang out during the day.
###25 
###28 The place was in tatters and didn't smell nice at all.
###31 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###32 
###81 CLEO: They seem like good kids.
###83 Not at all like the stereotypical thugs that media
###86 or right-wing grannies would make of them.
###88 They played us their latest track called "It's Time for
###91 Action."
###97 While it goes on a bit long for me, I actually love the
###100 energy of the boys.
###102 And so we decided to make a music video for the track.
###105 We're in this [INAUDIBLE] little cave shooting their
###107 video, so they're here chilling.
###109 Now walking through here, Dev's filming from backwards.
###113 I'm not keen on this room for various reasons.
###117 We get to this zone which has a strong smell.
###120 And in here is our friend, Mohammed, He's got very
###123 beautiful blue eyes.
###124 We've given him this stick and he's going
###127 to be here and sing.
###129 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###130 
###136 OK.
###137 So Dev, I'm behind you, right?
###139 
###152 CLEO: They're singing the chorus.
###155 They're getting ready, he's got his stick, he's
###157 very into his stick.
###161 CLEO: This place smells not-pleasant.
###164 Can't wait to get out of here.
###165 
###174 Oh my God, no way, no way, no way.
###179 The floor is covered with pigeon.
###181 Oh my God, I think I've just walked on a piece.
###183 I don't know if it's rat or pigeon.
###184 I'm not really sure.
###185 Am I being awk?
###188 I hope we finish soon, my nose is not enjoying.
###193 The kids were really getting on my nerve and they were
###195 really being silly and annoying.
###197 Because they were sitting behind and kept giving knees
###200 and stuff like that.
###201 And I turned around and I was really strict.
###203 I told them to call me Madam again.
###205 Because they were calling me Cleo and I said that I was too
###207 angry, and--
###210 they think I'm like an angry schoolteacher.
###213 But I am.
###214 They're too annoying and they're too noisy, and
###217 agitated, and fed up.
###220 One of them told me I was pregnant.
###222 I hate them.
###224 After a while we decided to stop shooting in that
###227 awk-smelling hangout, and drove them all to central
###231 Paris to shoot them performing at Parisian hot spot Le Baron.
###236 This venue used to be a brothel.
###238 It is now the hottest club in Paris, a.k.a., Le Baron.
###242 
###247 This person here, he's a renowned
###250 French graffiti artist.
###252 This is his trademark, it's a little man, Smiley, on the
###256 female's bum.
###257 I don't know where the shoes are from--
###260 maybe Chanel or something.
###262 I don't know whose bum this is.
###264 Everything's very disorganized.
###265 No smoke machine, no fog machine.
###269 A lot of noisy people.
###270 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###272 CLEO: While the video wasn't a 100% success, I think it was
###276 OK considering we only had half an hour to finish it
###279 before the club opened its doors to the
###280 posh Parisian adults.
###282 And of course our budget, which was about half the price
###284 of a bottle of cheap champagne.
###286
