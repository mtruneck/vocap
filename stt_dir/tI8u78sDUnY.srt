EILENE: Hello.


3
0:0:24,41 --> 0:0:25,34
My name is Eilene.


4
0:0:25,34 --> 0:0:26,59
Come and see the
red squirrels.


5
0:0:26,59 --> 0:0:33,428



6
0:0:33,428 --> 0:0:35,913
Upstairs, into the bedroom.

0:0:35,913 --> 0:0:37,404

0:0:45,853 --> 0:0:46,87
EILENE: [CHUCKLES]


11
0:0:46,87 --> 0:0:47,26
Right.


12
0:0:47,26 --> 0:0:49,41
Get out, you.


13
0:0:49,41 --> 0:0:52,66
Red squirrels are, I think,
they're reported to be the


14
0:0:52,66 --> 0:0:56,26
most intelligent of all the
small rodent family.


15
0:0:56,26 --> 0:0:59,7
They are without question one of
the cutest mammals we have


16
0:0:59,7 --> 0:0:59,64
in this country.


17
0:0:59,64 --> 0:1:1,56
There's no doubt about it--
if not the cutest.


18
0:1:1,56 --> 0:1:7,44



19
0:1:7,44 --> 0:1:10,98
These squirrels were in
a dray in a garden.


20
0:1:10,98 --> 0:1:13,2
We have terrible gales here.


21
0:1:13,2 --> 0:1:15,65
And the dray blew
out of the tree.


22
0:1:15,65 --> 0:1:17,4
There were actually
five of them.


23
0:1:17,4 --> 0:1:19,55
And when they went out to have
a look, one was dead.


24
0:1:19,55 --> 0:1:21,24
And the other four
were starting to


25
0:1:21,24 --> 0:1:22,32
crawl along the path.


26
0:1:22,32 --> 0:1:25,19
So they took them to the local
vet in [INAUDIBLE].


27
0:1:25,19 --> 0:1:27,76
That actually them rang me and
said, can you take them


28
0:1:27,76 --> 0:1:29,19
because they were going
on holiday.


29
0:1:29,19 --> 0:1:31,11
Oh, look who joined in now.


30
0:1:31,11 --> 0:1:31,9
There you go.


31
0:1:31,9 --> 0:1:33,86
Now, how cute is that?


32
0:1:33,86 --> 0:1:35,11
How cute.


33
0:1:35,11 --> 0:1:37,38



34
0:1:37,38 --> 0:1:38,82
There are three girls
and one boy.


35
0:1:38,82 --> 0:1:41,28
So the boy is easy
to distinguish.


36
0:1:41,28 --> 0:1:42,37
He's the runt of the litter.


37
0:1:42,37 --> 0:1:43,4
He's the smallest.


38
0:1:43,4 --> 0:1:45,4
All he wants to do is sleep.


39
0:1:45,4 --> 0:1:47,66
Whereas these three
girls are hyper.


40
0:1:47,66 --> 0:1:59,985



41
0:1:59,985 --> 0:2:4,39
Before-- oop, there he goes.


42
0:2:4,39 --> 0:2:7,265
Don't you dare jump
in my coffee.


43
0:2:7,265 --> 0:2:8,22
FEMALE SPEAKER: So you're
like mother--


44
0:2:8,22 --> 0:2:9,924
Mother Squirrel?


45
0:2:9,924 --> 0:2:10,35
EILENE: [CHUCKLES]


46
0:2:10,35 --> 0:2:11,21
At the moment, I'm Mommy.


47
0:2:11,21 --> 0:2:13,78
And I suppose, my
husband's Daddy.


48
0:2:13,78 --> 0:2:18,33
For me, looking after any
baby really is a joy.


49
0:2:18,33 --> 0:2:20,0
I think I must be a
natural nurturer.


50
0:2:20,0 --> 0:2:22,98
And when my children left home
and had grandchildren and then


51
0:2:22,98 --> 0:2:27,57
proceeded to live miles away, I
just had nothing to nurture.


52
0:2:27,57 --> 0:2:30,77
The cutest thing about a red
squirrel is I just have a


53
0:2:30,77 --> 0:2:33,5
thing about the little tufts
that get on the ears.


54
0:2:33,5 --> 0:2:35,91
That really just
melts my heart.


55
0:2:35,91 --> 0:2:42,92



56
0:2:42,92 --> 0:2:47,77
There's a question mark over
humanizing with wild animals.


57
0:2:47,77 --> 0:2:52,1
A lot of people will say that
maybe we've got them too tame.


58
0:2:52,1 --> 0:2:55,95
But my feeling is that if they
were with their mother, their


59
0:2:55,95 --> 0:2:57,38
mother would be nurturing
them.


60
0:2:57,38 --> 0:2:59,74
And I just feel that when
they're very young and


61
0:2:59,74 --> 0:3:3,4
vulnerable, nurturing won't
do them any harm.


62
0:3:3,4 --> 0:3:12,45



63
0:3:12,45 --> 0:3:15,0
Well, that is the most
unprofessional squirrel


64
0:3:15,0 --> 0:3:17,18
feeding I have ever done.


65
0:3:17,18 --> 0:3:20,0
It's a very bittersweet moment
the day they go.


66
0:3:20,0 --> 0:3:22,31
If they're fit and
they're healthy,


67
0:3:22,31 --> 0:3:24,21
then you have to release.


68
0:3:24,21 --> 0:3:26,0
And they are all fit
and healthy.


69
0:3:26,0 --> 0:3:28,64
And I can't, at the moment
anyway, see any reason not to


70
0:3:28,64 --> 0:3:29,5
release them.


71
0:3:29,5 --> 0:3:30,87
I'm going to be so sad.


72
0:3:30,87 --> 0:3:31,78
[CHUCKLES]


73
0:3:31,78 --> 0:3:35,42
You have such a wonderful
tail.


74
0:3:35,42 --> 0:3:38,85
And now, it's time
to go to bed--


75
0:3:38,85 --> 0:3:42,494
tired, tired little squirrel.


76
0:3:42,494 --> 0:3:44,68
Oh, look.


77
0:3:44,68 --> 0:3:47,168
Time to go to bed.


78
0:3:47,168 --> 0:3:50,172
Yes, you can be Zebedee.


79
0:3:50,172 --> 0:3:53,62
There you go into your bed.


80
0:3:53,62 --> 0:3:56,68
There'll be a little bit of
hodgy podgy, a bit of rough


81
0:3:56,68 --> 0:4:0,116
and tumble, and then eventually,
silence.
