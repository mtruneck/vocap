###1 STEVE SPANGLER: Ping pong balls.
###2 There's just something fun at the sound of a ping pong ball.
###5 I want to find a way to be able to make a
###7 ping pong ball fly.
###8 And not just like this--
###9 I want to find a way to be able to make a ping pong ball
###11 fly with force.
###13 And you can't just have one ping pong ball.
###15 It's better if you have dozens and dozens and dozens of ping
###18 pong balls.
###19 I want to find a way to launch them.
###21 I think I have some really cool ideas.
###23 I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all about making science fun.
###26 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###29 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###32 experiences.
###33 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###36 affect the way people think about science.
###39 And do that, I live by one motto--
###41 make it big, do it right, give it class.
###44 
###50 As a kid, I remember this ping pong ball popper that was
###52 pretty cool.
###53 It was just this kind of rubber device
###55 that had air inside.
###56 You would just kind of push this inside and squeeze it.
###58 It would pop.
###59 It wasn't terribly exciting, but it was a
###61 ping pong ball launcher.
###62 And then I saw this at the auto store.
###65 It's a battery filler.
###66 See this?
###67 This might be perfect for the first part.
###69 Now, I'm not advocating that you tear this
###71 apart at the store.
###72 You're going to have to buy it first.
###74 But that's the piece that you want-- this to the wayside.
###77 All right.
###77 So here's what happens is the ping pong ball fits perfectly
###81 inside here like this.
###82 It's just got enough pressure around it, like that.
###84 That's perfect.
###85 And when you squeeze it-- here, watch.
###87 Bam.
###88 This is a pretty good.
###90 What if there was an explosion inside, firing the ball out?
###93 That would be even better.
###94 And to do that, we've got to go to the camping aisle.
###97 Well, this is what you're looking for.
###98 It's a lantern spark igniter.
###101 So when you twist it, the flint inside
###104 gives it a little spark.
###105 This is what you're going to need.
###106 So take that home.
###106 You're also going to need to have some simple rules.
###109 And we're ready to build ourselves an igniter.
###112 The first step is to take that battery bulb and to poke a
###114 hole in it.
###115 The size of a screwdriver seems to be just about right.
###118 I don't want it too big-- kind of see what's going on inside,
###120 just kind of poking it through like that.
###122 That will be perfect.
###123 And then you just need to take apart the lantern lighter--
###127 the little spark igniter, right?
###129 So what I did was, just with a pair of pliers, loosened this
###133 and took this apart.
###134 All right?
###135 You need to be careful, because this is spring-loaded.
###137 It'll pop out, and it takes you another five minutes to
###139 stick everything back in again.
###140 What we want to do is to get this inside the bulb.
###144 So I'm going to put this down inside and try to feed that in
###146 through here so it pops out the other side, and we can
###149 twist this in place.
###150 Oh, that's perfect.
###151 This is what we're trying to do.
###152 Take a look at this.
###153 See how I finally get this down inside here like this?
###156 That's perfect.
###158 Again, you want to be very careful that you don't push on
###161 this little piece here, or it'll pop out.
###163 Now, I'm going to try to expose the threads that are
###166 right there--
###166 so you see-- so we have something to grab onto--
###169 that part right there.
###170 Washer goes on top like this.
###174 This piece goes on top.
###176 And now you just have to screw it together.
###179 The entire time, I'm keeping my finger on that little flute
###182 mechanism that's inside so it doesn't pop back.
###186 So that's pretty good.
###188 I'm even going to try to tighten it up a little bit
###190 just so it doesn't come undone.
###193 Perfect.
###194 Now, the last part will make you very angry if you don't
###197 keep your finger on that flint, because it's now time
###199 to put this end back on.
###201 And if you're not careful, it'll pop
###204 right back out again.
###205 So put this on here like this.
###207 
###210 All right, perfect.
###211 I think this should be great.
###213 Take a look down inside here like this.
###215 Watch.
###215 When you spin it, watch.
###218 See the little spark that's inside?
###220 That's the spark that we want to ignite the fuel that
###223 eventually will pop the ping pong ball out.
###226 I think this is great.
###227 All right, safety first, because now it's
###229 time for the fuel.
###230 And if you're a minor, make sure that you get an adult
###232 who's going to help you out with this.
###233 Here's the fuel--
###235 90% rubbing alcohol.
###236 I think this says 91%.
###238 Most rubbing alcohol is 70%.
###240 You're going to have to go to the drugstore for this.
###242 And since I'm only going to use drops at a time and I want
###245 to pour a lot out, I simply switched a small amount to
###247 this bottle right here.
###249 All right.
###249 You just need a small amount of the rubbing alcohol, so
###251 this is 15 or 20 drops in here like this.
###254 I'm being careful not to get the flint wet.
###257 And if you've shot it before, because there's no oxygen
###259 inside, you're going to go a little bit of air inside--
###263 just trying to move it around so there's
###265 enough there to combust.
###267 Now, you need to ping pong ball.
###270 Ping pong ball goes down inside like this.
###274 So now, here's what happens.
###275 Be careful.
###276 This is the business end.
###277 So when you flick it like this, you get a spark inside.
###280 The spark ignites the rubbing alcohol.
###282 The rubbing alcohol expands as it turns into a gas, and
###285 hopefully it shoots the ping pong ball out.
###287 It looks something like this.
###290 What?
###290 You want me to do it again?
###292 Of course.
###293 I have an entire bucket of these and a
###295 lot of rubbing alcohol.
###296 [HUMMING 'POP GOES THE WEASEL']
###298 
###303 STEVE SPANGLER: Pop goes the wea--
###304 sorry--
###305 the weasel.
###306 Now, if for any reason there's still a flame that's here,
###309 that's why I have a plate close by.
###310 I just put the plate over the top and it stops the flame
###313 completely.
###315 Don't put your hand over the top.
###316 Just put the plate over the top and everything is set.
###319 This is a pretty cool ping pong ball launcher.
###322 So we were recently contacted by a marketing firm that
###325 actually works for YouTube, and they wanted us to fire
###328 some ping pong balls.
###329 But they wanted us to fire of more than just
###331 one ping pong ball.
###332 They wanted 6,000 ping pong balls.
###334 And if you're going to fire 6,000 ping pong balls, this is
###336 probably not a good idea.
###338 So I knew I needed to have a bigger space.
###340 So I got some liquid nitrogen, a 55 gallon drum, 6,000 ping
###344 pong balls, and a little bit bigger space.
###347 And I think we got just exactly what they needed.
###349 Watch out.
###351 All right, so here's what we're doing right now.
###353 We just want to test just the liquid nitrogen in the barrel
###356 and just see kind of what happens before
###357 the ping pong balls.
###358 It's actually much better with the ping pong balls, because
###360 they cushion them.
###361 So this is going to be the worst loud explosion up here.
###364 We want to see what happens.
###366 So this is what's happening.
###367 We're behind the scenes.
###368 We're just making sure that all the cameras are set and
###370 we're ready to go.
###371 And everybody's got glasses and year protection.
###375 And come here.
###375 Look at this.
###376 Brian's still working.
###378 See?
###378 He just has his little headphones on and he's still
###380 working, because why wouldn't he?
###382 
###385 All right.
###385 So here's our liquid nitrogen sitting in here.
###388 I'm going to cap it off.
###390 It's going to go inside the barrel.
###391 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###393 [EXPLOSION]
###397 STEVE SPANGLER: Did I mention don't try this at home?
###398 Take a look at what happens here, right?
###400 So please understand that we're under a protective
###403 environment, and just don't try this at home.
###406 
###414 MALE SPEAKER: Whoa!
###416 MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] five.
###417 MALE SPEAKER: Whoa!
###418 
###420 STEVE SPANGLER: What's important about this is we get
###422 pristine two liter bottles.
###423 We don't want anything that's been crushed or wrinkled or
###425 anything like that.
###426 That's a bad situation.
###427 I don't know what the stress is on that bottle, so I want
###429 brand new ones.
###432 This is Brad Montgomery--
###434 a really, really good friend, funny, funny, funny, comedian,
###437 magician, best friend.
###439 This is how it works.
###440 BRAD MONTGOMERY: New glasses work.
###441 STEVE SPANGLER: Yes, and he's got his new glasses.
###442 And the deal is we're going stage him in my office.
###445 And so he's just supposed to sit there and just pretend
###447 like he doesn't even realize what's going to happen.
###448 BRAD MONTGOMERY: And I'm totally going to prank with
###450 your computer.
###451 STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.
###452 
###458 Why don't you be the safety advisor?
###461 BRAD MONTGOMERY: Yes.
###463 
###479 Steve's making a big fuss over this.
###480 It's not a horrible idea, but I'm telling you, it's not as
###483 cool as he thought, because I did this yesterday.
###486 OK, not totally 6,000--
###488 around 3,000, 3,500 ping pong balls.
###491 So I mean, it's pretty cool.
###493 You'd think he's--
###495 woo, 6,000!
###496 Whatever.
###499 STEVE SPANGLER: Oh, that's perfect.
###501 I'm ready.
###502 For today's experiment, we're going to demonstrate just how
###505 many views YouTube Mobile gets in a single day.
###508 So let's say this represents YouTube.
###512 See that ping pong ball right there?
###513 It represents 100,000 views from mobile devices.
###517 And this bottle of liquid nitrogen?
###520 It doesn't represent anything.
###521 It's just really cool.
###523 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###524 STEVE SPANGLER: Don't try this at home.

###599 STEVE SPANGLER: I want turkey wrap.
###600 FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.
