###6 Hi, Mireya Mayor. While I usually explore remote corners of the world to push the boundaries of adventure,
###13 and to inspire people to care about the planet,
###15 when I'm home, I have just as much fun exploring our corner of the world with my family.
###21 These are my daughters Emma and Eva and today we're going to explore our local park.
###25 Let's go! Let's go!
###34 Whether you have fifteen minutes or a full day, there are so many wonderful lessons
###39 for young explorers to experience locally.
###43 Whether it's the backyard, the park, or a nearby beach, there are many things to explore.
###49 Some things I always like to bring along are a digital camera.
###55 Photographs are a great way for children to show how they see the world.
###61 A magnifying glass, to look closely at a piece of grass, flower, or insect,
###67 a net to catch little critters,
###74 a little notebook to document what you found,
###79 and binoculars, to take a closer look.
###84 Remind your children to be gentle with whatever they discover.
###90 For me, the most important thing is just to get outside,
###94 and most often, adventure will find you.
###100 You can find more tips, ideas, and great activities for exploring your surroundings
###104 on potterybarnkids.com. Get out and explore!
