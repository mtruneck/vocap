0:0:17,11 --> 0:0:20,17
ALEX JONES: Politicians are
there to lie and deceive and


3
0:0:20,17 --> 0:0:23,68
to continually trick the people
into never getting


4
0:0:23,68 --> 0:0:25,59
control of their
society again.


5
0:0:25,59 --> 0:0:27,58
They are there to keep
the elites in power.


6
0:0:27,58 --> 0:0:30,5
They are there for the upper
class to wage war against the


7
0:0:30,5 --> 0:0:31,64
middle class and the
working class.


8
0:0:31,64 --> 0:0:35,42
It's the two parties teamed up
against the people, two wings


9
0:0:35,42 --> 0:0:37,14
on the same bird of prey.


10
0:0:37,14 --> 0:0:38,65
Instead of looking at the wings
all day, let's talk


11
0:0:38,65 --> 0:0:41,675
about the head, the beak, the
guts of this thing, its mind,


12
0:0:41,675 --> 0:0:45,25
its eyes, what it believes,
what this bird does.


13
0:0:45,25 --> 0:0:46,4
This is tyranny.


14
0:0:46,4 --> 0:0:47,79
This is what globalism is.


15
0:0:47,79 --> 0:0:49,26
We want a new world order?


16
0:0:49,26 --> 0:0:51,47
It's the banks that engineered
the collapse and they're


17
0:0:51,47 --> 0:0:52,41
bragging about it.


18
0:0:52,41 --> 0:0:55,26
Folks, what we know is
off the chart crazy.


19
0:0:55,26 --> 0:1:0,17
Imagine what we don't know
because truth is strange,


20
0:1:0,17 --> 0:1:1,42
ladies and gentlemen.


21
0:1:1,42 --> 0:1:4,15



22
0:1:4,15 --> 0:1:5,55
RYAN DUFFY: So we started
shooting this piece in the


23
0:1:5,55 --> 0:1:7,16
spring of 2009.


24
0:1:7,16 --> 0:1:9,82
President Obama had just been
elected and was enjoying


25
0:1:9,82 --> 0:1:11,15
really high approval ratings.


26
0:1:11,15 --> 0:1:13,25
And most people were still
holding out hope that we could


27
0:1:13,25 --> 0:1:15,42
get through the economic crisis
and things would be


28
0:1:15,42 --> 0:1:16,99
back to normal soon.


29
0:1:16,99 --> 0:1:19,33
But as we traveled across the
country, we began the kind of


30
0:1:19,33 --> 0:1:20,52
sense that there was
something else


31
0:1:20,52 --> 0:1:22,7
stirring under the surface.


32
0:1:22,7 --> 0:1:23,98
There was this growing movement
of people who really


33
0:1:23,98 --> 0:1:26,781
feared the government and
rejected this idea of hope all


34
0:1:26,781 --> 0:1:27,3
together.


35
0:1:27,3 --> 0:1:28,848
-Be out here and show
people that we--


36
0:1:28,848 --> 0:1:31,243
I've never protested anything
in my life.


37
0:1:31,243 --> 0:1:32,201
This is the first time.


38
0:1:32,201 --> 0:1:32,473
RYAN DUFFY: Oh, really.


39
0:1:32,473 --> 0:1:33,16
This is the first time.


40
0:1:33,16 --> 0:1:33,68
-This is the first time.


41
0:1:33,68 --> 0:1:34,25
RYAN DUFFY: Wow.


42
0:1:34,25 --> 0:1:37,225
-But I see a need for it and I'm
going to be here until the


43
0:1:37,225 --> 0:1:39,39
last petal falls.


44
0:1:39,39 --> 0:1:41,13
RYAN DUFFY: More and more folks
were starting to listen


45
0:1:41,13 --> 0:1:42,452
to people like Alex Jones.


46
0:1:42,452 --> 0:1:43,838
-[INAUDIBLE]


47
0:1:43,838 --> 0:1:45,105
ALEX JONES: Come on, people.


48
0:1:45,105 --> 0:1:46,56
The elite are going for broke.


49
0:1:46,56 --> 0:1:49,32
The level of crimes and looting
and corruption they


50
0:1:49,32 --> 0:1:53,12
have engaged means they were
going all the way to the--


51
0:1:53,12 --> 0:1:54,75
RYAN DUFFY: They believed we
were standing on the edge of a


52
0:1:54,75 --> 0:1:57,6
total collapse and they were
getting ready to fight in the


53
0:1:57,6 --> 0:1:59,112
second American Revolution.


54
0:1:59,112 --> 0:2:12,91
[MUSIC PLAYING]


55
0:2:12,91 --> 0:2:15,56
CHRIS HEDGES: It's the
end of an era.


56
0:2:15,56 --> 0:2:17,85
We live in a state of collective
self delusion.


57
0:2:17,85 --> 0:2:24,88



58
0:2:24,88 --> 0:2:26,73
My name is Chris Hedges.


59
0:2:26,73 --> 0:2:30,77
I graduated from seminary at
Harvard Divinity School, did


60
0:2:30,77 --> 0:2:31,94
not get ordained.


61
0:2:31,94 --> 0:2:34,66
I spent almost 20 years of
my life as a foreign


62
0:2:34,66 --> 0:2:36,64
correspondent, eventually,
15 of them with


63
0:2:36,64 --> 0:2:38,25
the New York Times.


64
0:2:38,25 --> 0:2:42,94
I came back to United States,
ran afoul of my employer over


65
0:2:42,94 --> 0:2:44,46
the issue of the Iraq War.


66
0:2:44,46 --> 0:2:47,23
I was told not to speak out
against the war or I would


67
0:2:47,23 --> 0:2:48,493
lose my job.


68
0:2:48,493 --> 0:2:51,49
And faced with that choice,
I left the paper.


69
0:2:51,49 --> 0:2:53,72
I write books.


70
0:2:53,72 --> 0:2:55,5
And when I'm not doing that,
I'm a soccer dad.


71
0:2:55,5 --> 0:2:58,98



72
0:2:58,98 --> 0:3:4,1
Conspiracy theories become a way
to explain the chaos of a


73
0:3:4,1 --> 0:3:5,95
world people don't understand.


74
0:3:5,95 --> 0:3:9,3
What conspiracy theorists don't
grasp is that the elite


75
0:3:9,3 --> 0:3:10,99
is also inept.


76
0:3:10,99 --> 0:3:14,82
And conspiracy theorists
frighten me because they can't


77
0:3:14,82 --> 0:3:20,7
read reality any more than
people who naively believe


78
0:3:20,7 --> 0:3:26,13
that a corrupt elite is going
to bring back the salad days


79
0:3:26,13 --> 0:3:28,56
of casino capitalism
can read reality.


80
0:3:28,56 --> 0:3:32,22
And the worse it gets, the less
people can confront it


81
0:3:32,22 --> 0:3:34,67
because it's painful.


82
0:3:34,67 --> 0:3:38,8
SGT. CHARLES DYER: American
patriots, you may or may not


83
0:3:38,8 --> 0:3:40,27
agree with what I'm
about to say.


84
0:3:40,27 --> 0:3:42,56
This is not the time for
reservation or political


85
0:3:42,56 --> 0:3:43,72
correctness.


86
0:3:43,72 --> 0:3:48,74
What lies before us is of grave
concern to freedom.


87
0:3:48,74 --> 0:3:52,6
Because of what your chance to
lose by remaining silent,


88
0:3:52,6 --> 0:3:54,52
silence shouldn't even
be an option.


89
0:3:54,52 --> 0:3:56,85
My name is Sergeant
Charles Dyer.


90
0:3:56,85 --> 0:4:0,32
I'm a United States Marine,
an Oath Keeper, and a


91
0:4:0,32 --> 0:4:2,35
constitutional patriot.


92
0:4:2,35 --> 0:4:7,16
I entered the Marine Corps in
1998 at the tender age of 17.


93
0:4:7,16 --> 0:4:10,98
Back then I was piss and
vinegar and ready


94
0:4:10,98 --> 0:4:12,8
for a fight, I guess.


95
0:4:12,8 --> 0:4:13,64
I didn't care about politics.


96
0:4:13,64 --> 0:4:15,83
I was all about following orders
and doing what I was


97
0:4:15,83 --> 0:4:20,35
told and fighting for freedom
across the globe, I suppose,


98
0:4:20,35 --> 0:4:23,12
as any young marine would.


99
0:4:23,12 --> 0:4:26,665
I'm actually very new to the
resistance movement.


100
0:4:26,665 --> 0:4:29,81
I've probably only been awake
with the situation for maybe


101
0:4:29,81 --> 0:4:32,38
the last year or so.


102
0:4:32,38 --> 0:4:34,66
It's the targets.


103
0:4:34,66 --> 0:4:38,8
The patriot movement is
basically consisting of all


104
0:4:38,8 --> 0:4:40,0
kinds of different organizations
all across the


105
0:4:40,0 --> 0:4:40,942
United States.


106
0:4:40,942 --> 0:4:45,34
You're looking at militias or
maybe the American resistance


107
0:4:45,34 --> 0:4:47,905
movement, the umbrella
organization.


108
0:4:47,905 --> 0:4:50,39
You may have the Ohio militia,
or Michigan militia or,


109
0:4:50,39 --> 0:4:51,84
whatever militias all
over the place.


110
0:4:51,84 --> 0:4:55,72
Citizens militias like in San
Diego, they're all under the


111
0:4:55,72 --> 0:4:57,41
patriot movement.


112
0:4:57,41 --> 0:5:0,35
And we're trying to take back
this Republic and restore this


113
0:5:0,35 --> 0:5:2,926
Republic like it's supposed to
be, what it was intended from


114
0:5:2,926 --> 0:5:4,176
our founders.


115
0:5:4,176 --> 0:5:6,89



116
0:5:6,89 --> 0:5:10,98
We're here to meet gsbamerica
from YouTube.


117
0:5:10,98 --> 0:5:12,9
His name's--


118
0:5:12,9 --> 0:5:14,78
well, I guess I probably
shouldn't say his name, huh?


119
0:5:14,78 --> 0:5:16,3
gsbamerica from YouTube.


120
0:5:16,3 --> 0:5:20,727



121
0:5:20,727 --> 0:5:21,22
JALIRA: Hello.


122
0:5:21,22 --> 0:5:21,713
SGT. CHARLES DYER: How
are you doing today?


123
0:5:21,713 --> 0:5:23,2
JALIRA: Good, how are you?


124
0:5:23,2 --> 0:5:23,535
I'm Heather.


125
0:5:23,535 --> 0:5:25,345
This is the first time
we've ever met, I


126
0:5:25,345 --> 0:5:26,9
mean, besides YouTube.


127
0:5:26,9 --> 0:5:28,18
We've talked on the phone and
we've emailed plenty.


128
0:5:28,18 --> 0:5:33,37
But everybody gets real excited
about YouTube stars.


129
0:5:33,37 --> 0:5:36,29
I'm Jalira on YouTube.


130
0:5:36,29 --> 0:5:36,75
SGT. CHARLES DYER: That's
our biggest


131
0:5:36,75 --> 0:5:37,945
weapon now, the internet.


132
0:5:37,945 --> 0:5:40,98
That's getting the
word out so fast.


133
0:5:40,98 --> 0:5:43,8
I think that's where I probably
woke up at, watch


134
0:5:43,8 --> 0:5:44,752
stuff on the net.


135
0:5:44,752 --> 0:5:47,763
GSBAMERICA: And if even a
quarter of the stuff we read


136
0:5:47,763 --> 0:5:50,48
is true, then we've
got problems.


137
0:5:50,48 --> 0:5:52,17
SGT. CHARLES DYER: Just the
stuff that you can prove is--


138
0:5:52,17 --> 0:5:54,54
we know we have problems with
the globalization, them saying


139
0:5:54,54 --> 0:5:55,81
they want a new world order.


140
0:5:55,81 --> 0:5:58,62
They want a global government.


141
0:5:58,62 --> 0:6:0,935
They want everything to be
under one law, you know.


142
0:6:0,935 --> 0:6:3,83
When you start delving into some
of this stuff-- and it's


143
0:6:3,83 --> 0:6:7,67
not hard to get on
a path of just--


144
0:6:7,67 --> 0:6:10,391
it makes you crazy, learning all
the crap that happens in


145
0:6:10,391 --> 0:6:12,38
this country.


146
0:6:12,38 --> 0:6:15,13
-I don't understand
what's going on.


147
0:6:15,13 --> 0:6:18,28
We've got to wake the people up
to realize that our country


148
0:6:18,28 --> 0:6:20,77
is just going down
the tubes and our


149
0:6:20,77 --> 0:6:23,21
government is doing it.


150
0:6:23,21 --> 0:6:28,51
I see if something is not done
very quickly to stop Obama and


151
0:6:28,51 --> 0:6:33,17
Pelosi and everything else going
on, I can guarantee you,


152
0:6:33,17 --> 0:6:36,33
we're going to be in a civil
war in a very short time.


153
0:6:36,33 --> 0:6:37,755
But I will fight.


154
0:6:37,755 --> 0:6:41,0



155
0:6:41,0 --> 0:6:44,23
Deport Illegals.


156
0:6:44,23 --> 0:6:47,32
End the deficit in California.


157
0:6:47,32 --> 0:6:50,204
-No bail out for Mexico.


158
0:6:50,204 --> 0:6:52,19
-So anyway, I have
a guest here.


159
0:6:52,19 --> 0:6:57,61
He wanted to talk to you guys
just about the Oath Keepers.


160
0:6:57,61 --> 0:6:59,99
And I don't know if everybody
knows who the Oath Keeprs.


161
0:6:59,99 --> 0:7:0,942
-Yes.


162
0:7:0,942 --> 0:7:2,38
-Yeah, they're awesome.


163
0:7:2,38 --> 0:7:3,741
They give me a lot of hope.


164
0:7:3,741 --> 0:7:6,627



165
0:7:6,627 --> 0:7:8,12
SGT. CHARLES DYER: All right,
I see a lot of older faces


166
0:7:8,12 --> 0:7:8,55
around here.


167
0:7:8,55 --> 0:7:12,89
How many of you guys
are military?


168
0:7:12,89 --> 0:7:14,41
Military?


169
0:7:14,41 --> 0:7:16,902
I All right, Oath Keepers,
that's the organization that


170
0:7:16,902 --> 0:7:21,54
I'm apart of and we try to touch
out to active and former


171
0:7:21,54 --> 0:7:24,16
military and law enforcement,
anybody's who taken an oath to


172
0:7:24,16 --> 0:7:27,55
defend the Constitution, try to
make them realize that the


173
0:7:27,55 --> 0:7:29,24
oath they took doesn't expire.


174
0:7:29,24 --> 0:7:31,22
So for you older gentleman,
too, you may


175
0:7:31,22 --> 0:7:32,7
think I'm too old.


176
0:7:32,7 --> 0:7:36,9
There's nothing I
can do, right?


177
0:7:36,9 --> 0:7:37,51
That's wrong.


178
0:7:37,51 --> 0:7:40,44
This is bigger than the
immigration problem.


179
0:7:40,44 --> 0:7:44,75
Right now, the United States
government and governments all


180
0:7:44,75 --> 0:7:48,14
over the world are trying to
bring in globalization.


181
0:7:48,14 --> 0:7:50,9
I don't know if any of you have
ever heard the term new


182
0:7:50,9 --> 0:7:52,65
world order.


183
0:7:52,65 --> 0:7:54,79
They're trying to bring in a
new world order and destroy


184
0:7:54,79 --> 0:7:56,11
our sovereignty.


185
0:7:56,11 --> 0:7:59,3
That is a direct attack
on the Constitution


186
0:7:59,3 --> 0:8:1,69
of this United States.


187
0:8:1,69 --> 0:8:6,37
That means that they are the
domestic enemy that I swore to


188
0:8:6,37 --> 0:8:10,22
defend and fight against to
defend my Constitution.


189
0:8:10,22 --> 0:8:13,33
And I'm willing to put
my life on the line


190
0:8:13,33 --> 0:8:14,42
to defend this country.


191
0:8:14,42 --> 0:8:17,43
And I'm asking that anybody
who's taken the


192
0:8:17,43 --> 0:8:18,94
oath to do the same.


193
0:8:18,94 --> 0:8:20,73
And it doesn't matter
your age.


194
0:8:20,73 --> 0:8:22,3
So that's all that I really
want to talk to


195
0:8:22,3 --> 0:8:23,91
you guys about today.


196
0:8:23,91 --> 0:8:26,628
And I thank you all for
coming out here.


197
0:8:26,628 --> 0:8:28,27
ALEX JONES: This is
very exciting.


198
0:8:28,27 --> 0:8:31,29
Oath Keeprs just started a few
months ago, Stewart Rhodes,


199
0:8:31,29 --> 0:8:33,85
former Airborne Ranger in the
army, worked for the Ron Paul


200
0:8:33,85 --> 0:8:35,76
campaign at the highest levels,
got upset about what


201
0:8:35,76 --> 0:8:37,6
was happening with the new world
order after the campaign


202
0:8:37,6 --> 0:8:39,674
ended, knew that things
were intensifying.


203
0:8:39,674 --> 0:8:42,9
And he understood that
tyranny will come to


204
0:8:42,9 --> 0:8:44,169
your door in a uniform.


205
0:8:44,169 --> 0:8:48,5
-Welcome to Lexington, the
cradle of American liberty.


206
0:8:48,5 --> 0:8:52,5



207
0:8:52,5 --> 0:8:55,52
ALEX JONES: So perfect timing
with the first big Oath


208
0:8:55,52 --> 0:8:58,84
Keepers meeting coming up on the
green in Lexington where


209
0:8:58,84 --> 0:9:2,6
it all started in 1775,
April 19th.


210
0:9:2,6 --> 0:9:3,99
SGT. CHARLES DYER: We went
to Lexington Green.


211
0:9:3,99 --> 0:9:7,85
What we were there to do was
just to let people know about


212
0:9:7,85 --> 0:9:11,48
Oath Keeprs and what Oath
Keepers were and what it was


213
0:9:11,48 --> 0:9:16,6
to keep an oath and not just
take an oath because there's a


214
0:9:16,6 --> 0:9:16,76
big difference between them.


215
0:9:16,76 --> 0:9:18,64
-[INAUDIBLE]


216
0:9:18,64 --> 0:9:19,946
-Pledging my life--


217
0:9:19,946 --> 0:9:21,57
-Pledging my life--


218
0:9:21,57 --> 0:9:22,49
-My fortune--


219
0:9:22,49 --> 0:9:23,33
-My fortune--


220
0:9:23,33 --> 0:9:24,72
-And my sacred--


221
0:9:24,72 --> 0:9:26,57
-It's where the first shots of
the revolution were fired.


222
0:9:26,57 --> 0:9:29,67
The first revolution, not the
new, second, upcoming


223
0:9:29,67 --> 0:9:30,24
revolution.


224
0:9:30,24 --> 0:9:32,32
LTD CMDR GUY CUNNINGHAM:
--studies that when I took the


225
0:9:32,32 --> 0:9:35,86
oath of office to uphold and
defend the constitution of the


226
0:9:35,86 --> 0:9:38,76
United States of America against
all enemies, foreign


227
0:9:38,76 --> 0:9:43,31
and domestic, I knew in my
heart what I meant when I


228
0:9:43,31 --> 0:9:46,1
raised my hand and
swore to it.


229
0:9:46,1 --> 0:9:46,955
-Yeah.


230
0:9:46,955 --> 0:9:53,64
[APPLAUSE]


231
0:9:53,64 --> 0:9:54,61
STEWART RHODES: You
see the need to


232
0:9:54,61 --> 0:9:55,74
stand up and say, look--


233
0:9:55,74 --> 0:9:58,38
I get letters all the time from
people that are terrified


234
0:9:58,38 --> 0:10:1,13
and concerned and worried that
the military's going to be


235
0:10:1,13 --> 0:10:1,76
used against them.


236
0:10:1,76 --> 0:10:3,11
And I saw that during Bush.


237
0:10:3,11 --> 0:10:5,31
There were Democrats that were
upset about that and rightly


238
0:10:5,31 --> 0:10:8,11
so, looking at the rhetoric of
the Bush administration.


239
0:10:8,11 --> 0:10:9,56
Now, you got Obama in there.


240
0:10:9,56 --> 0:10:11,24
And now you've got people
on the conservative side


241
0:10:11,24 --> 0:10:12,18
who are waking up.


242
0:10:12,18 --> 0:10:14,24
And the reason why they're so
afraid is because they all


243
0:10:14,24 --> 0:10:17,31
understand that power was
grown so much and the


244
0:10:17,31 --> 0:10:20,4
constraints on government has
been eroded so much that they


245
0:10:20,4 --> 0:10:21,47
are all vulnerable.


246
0:10:21,47 --> 0:10:24,475
When one guy's in charge, then
the other guys are terrified.


247
0:10:24,475 --> 0:10:27,482
When their guy's in charge,
then their terrified.


248
0:10:27,482 --> 0:10:30,14
ALEX JONES: With every
successive month that follows,


249
0:10:30,14 --> 0:10:32,85
more and more people wake up
to the two puppet system.


250
0:10:32,85 --> 0:10:35,19
There's a puppet on the left,
a puppet on the right.


251
0:10:35,19 --> 0:10:37,5
Wait, it's one guy holding
both puppets.


252
0:10:37,5 --> 0:10:39,31
I don't like that guy.


253
0:10:39,31 --> 0:10:42,5
CHRIS HEDGES: There's no dispute
among the supposed


254
0:10:42,5 --> 0:10:44,145
spectrum between the left and
the right, between Democratic


255
0:10:44,145 --> 0:10:49,44
and Republican over the
core ideology that


256
0:10:49,44 --> 0:10:52,49
is raping the country.


257
0:10:52,49 --> 0:10:59,67
So corporatism is about as close
to unmitigated evil as


258
0:10:59,67 --> 0:11:6,3
you can get because it has built
into it a kind of logic


259
0:11:6,3 --> 0:11:11,35
of increasing profits without
any regard for the human cost.


260
0:11:11,35 --> 0:11:13,62
We've destroyed our country.


261
0:11:13,62 --> 0:11:15,31
We've decimated our
working class.


262
0:11:15,31 --> 0:11:17,72
We are in the process of
decimating our middle class.


263
0:11:17,72 --> 0:11:20,33
We've created an American
oligarchy.


264
0:11:20,33 --> 0:11:23,16
We are allowing corporate
powers to destroy the


265
0:11:23,16 --> 0:11:25,95
ecosystem that sustains
the human species.


266
0:11:25,95 --> 0:11:28,89
Nobody is stepping up,
least of all Barack


267
0:11:28,89 --> 0:11:30,47
Obama, to stop it.


268
0:11:30,47 --> 0:11:35,12
And we are diverted by
bread and circus.


269
0:11:35,12 --> 0:11:38,58
If you doubt it, just watch
what passes for news.


270
0:11:38,58 --> 0:11:39,46
STEVE DOOCY: Hello, everybody.


271
0:11:39,46 --> 0:11:41,7
I'm Steve Doocy with
your FOX Flash.


272
0:11:41,7 --> 0:11:46,18
The octomom and her mother, the
octo grandma, face off in


273
0:11:46,18 --> 0:11:47,41
a heated online interview.


274
0:11:47,41 --> 0:11:48,74
-You already have six
beautiful children.


275
0:11:48,74 --> 0:11:49,48
-You need to learn to let go.


276
0:11:49,48 --> 0:11:50,3
-Why would you do this?


277
0:11:50,3 --> 0:11:51,94
-But you need to learn
to let go.


278
0:11:51,94 --> 0:11:55,75
-So I will never understand.


279
0:11:55,75 --> 0:11:55,84
BARACK OBAMA: He's sleeping
inside the White House.


280
0:11:55,84 --> 0:11:57,36
-Is he going to be in a bed?


281
0:11:57,36 --> 0:11:59,72
BARACK OBAMA: Not in my bed.


282
0:11:59,72 --> 0:12:3,74
-Recently, we've made some
life changing decisions.


283
0:12:3,74 --> 0:12:5,72
CHRIS HEDGES: Given the gravity
of the situation


284
0:12:5,72 --> 0:12:9,13
around us, it would almost
be amusing if


285
0:12:9,13 --> 0:12:13,21
it wasn't so dangerous.


286
0:12:13,21 --> 0:12:15,56
That's how empires die.


287
0:12:15,56 --> 0:12:16,21
And we're dying.


288
0:12:16,21 --> 0:12:17,46
We're dying.


289
0:12:17,46 --> 0:12:19,95



290
0:12:19,95 --> 0:12:21,68
SGT. CHARLES DYER: Let me
ask you a question.


291
0:12:21,68 --> 0:12:23,75
Would you follow the
Constitution against any


292
0:12:23,75 --> 0:12:26,1
orders, even if the President
gives an order?


293
0:12:26,1 --> 0:12:27,926
You would stay with the
constitution and defend it?


294
0:12:27,926 --> 0:12:28,37
-Yes.


295
0:12:28,37 --> 0:12:29,56
SGT. CHARLES DYER: Then
he is an Oath Keeper.


296
0:12:29,56 --> 0:12:30,71
There you go.


297
0:12:30,71 --> 0:12:33,15
It's that simple.


298
0:12:33,15 --> 0:12:35,83
All right, now we're at
Escondido, California at Mr.


299
0:12:35,83 --> 0:12:37,4
Paint Ball.


300
0:12:37,4 --> 0:12:38,42
And we come out here to play
air soft and do a little


301
0:12:38,42 --> 0:12:40,42
training and stuff.


302
0:12:40,42 --> 0:12:43,53
I normally meet some militia
members from San Diego.


303
0:12:43,53 --> 0:12:46,3
Some of my guys help train their
guys since all my guys


304
0:12:46,3 --> 0:12:49,78
are marines and they're
all civilians.


305
0:12:49,78 --> 0:12:51,83
We need a citizen militia.


306
0:12:51,83 --> 0:12:54,45
We need a citizen militia
to defend us from


307
0:12:54,45 --> 0:12:56,38
the government, basically.


308
0:12:56,38 --> 0:12:58,67
That's the only reason we have
the Second Amendment is to


309
0:12:58,67 --> 0:13:1,95
defend the American people and
our country from a tyrannical


310
0:13:1,95 --> 0:13:3,4
government, which is
what we're heading


311
0:13:3,4 --> 0:13:4,99
toward right now.


312
0:13:4,99 --> 0:13:7,2
Watch that left flank, now.


313
0:13:7,2 --> 0:13:10,61
We are definitely the guardians
of the Republic and


314
0:13:10,61 --> 0:13:14,74
the last stand if something
comes down because the


315
0:13:14,74 --> 0:13:21,19
military, they fall under the
UCMJ and a lot of people will


316
0:13:21,19 --> 0:13:25,18
follow any order just for fear
of being thrown to prison and


317
0:13:25,18 --> 0:13:26,18
put in the brig.


318
0:13:26,18 --> 0:13:30,612
There's a lot of us that will
defy orders as long as it's


319
0:13:30,612 --> 0:13:33,62
for the Constitution and defense
of the Constitution.


320
0:13:33,62 --> 0:13:35,17
We know what this
is all about.


321
0:13:35,17 --> 0:13:36,81
We know why we're here.


322
0:13:36,81 --> 0:13:39,465
And we're very strong in our
beliefs and our convictions.


323
0:13:39,465 --> 0:13:42,57



324
0:13:42,57 --> 0:13:45,25
They need to realize that the
reasons we're in Iraq and


325
0:13:45,25 --> 0:13:46,88
Afghanistan right now
are not as good as


326
0:13:46,88 --> 0:13:48,49
people think they are.


327
0:13:48,49 --> 0:13:50,33
Right now we're doing nothing
other than feeding the


328
0:13:50,33 --> 0:13:52,91
industrial military complex
and creating debt for the


329
0:13:52,91 --> 0:13:55,98
Federal Reserve, which isn't
even a federal organization,


330
0:13:55,98 --> 0:13:58,18
so that they can enslave
us and control us.


331
0:13:58,18 --> 0:14:0,6
So join the military?


332
0:14:0,6 --> 0:14:2,26
Depends on what you want
to do with it.


333
0:14:2,26 --> 0:14:4,89
Me, I'm going to use my training
from the military


334
0:14:4,89 --> 0:14:10,47
and, I suppose, become one of
those domestic terrorists that


335
0:14:10,47 --> 0:14:14,0
we're so afraid of from the
DHS and their reports.


336
0:14:14,0 --> 0:14:16,82
Ridiculous.


337
0:14:16,82 --> 0:14:19,11
-Remember, I got detained
and searched


338
0:14:19,11 --> 0:14:20,77
while I was in uniform.


339
0:14:20,77 --> 0:14:22,22
SGT. CHARLES DYER: Really?


340
0:14:22,22 --> 0:14:26,135
-Last day service uniform, two
ribbons on my breast, my


341
0:14:26,135 --> 0:14:29,57
freaking [INAUDIBLE]
badge and all.


342
0:14:29,57 --> 0:14:32,5
I got detained, Dallas, Fort
Worth, on my lay over.


343
0:14:32,5 --> 0:14:33,63
Searched my bag.


344
0:14:33,63 --> 0:14:34,36
Searched my gear.


345
0:14:34,36 --> 0:14:35,7
Searched everything.


346
0:14:35,7 --> 0:14:36,17
SGT. CHARLES DYER:
We are definitely


347
0:14:36,17 --> 0:14:37,856
targets now, military.


348
0:14:37,856 --> 0:14:39,65
We are targets.


349
0:14:39,65 --> 0:14:40,94
And that is sad.


350
0:14:40,94 --> 0:14:41,88
That's sad.


351
0:14:41,88 --> 0:14:43,48
I've been to Iraq.


352
0:14:43,48 --> 0:14:46,7
I've been deployed.


353
0:14:46,7 --> 0:14:48,2
I've got nothing but
the strongest


354
0:14:48,2 --> 0:14:49,27
feelings for my country.


355
0:14:49,27 --> 0:14:58,29



356
0:14:58,29 --> 0:15:7,99
Having marines die over there
and then we come home and


357
0:15:7,99 --> 0:15:10,5
those bastards want to talk
about how we're domestic


358
0:15:10,5 --> 0:15:13,53
terrorists and a threat
to this country.


359
0:15:13,53 --> 0:15:14,78
It makes me so angry.


360
0:15:14,78 --> 0:15:19,22



361
0:15:19,22 --> 0:15:22,1
It just saddens me to think that
we come back and we're


362
0:15:22,1 --> 0:15:24,99
treated like that by
our government.


363
0:15:24,99 --> 0:15:26,68
You know, I got one of my
marines right here being


364
0:15:26,68 --> 0:15:29,78
detained for hours because he's
in uniform trying to get


365
0:15:29,78 --> 0:15:32,61
through the metal detectors
in an airport?


366
0:15:32,61 --> 0:15:34,227
It's ridiculous.


367
0:15:34,227 --> 0:15:35,72
Ridiculous.


368
0:15:35,72 --> 0:15:36,61
Things have to change.


369
0:15:36,61 --> 0:15:38,53
It can't go on like this.


370
0:15:38,53 --> 0:15:39,78
Something has to be done.


371
0:15:39,78 --> 0:15:44,26



372
0:15:44,26 --> 0:15:46,34
ALEX JONES: I've got
this breaking news.


373
0:15:46,34 --> 0:15:51,54
National security watch, 60
right wing terror plots foiled


374
0:15:51,54 --> 0:15:55,51
in the ten years since the '95
Oklahoma City bombing killed


375
0:15:55,51 --> 0:15:56,42
168 people.


376
0:15:56,42 --> 0:15:57,65
By the way, that was
a federal bombing.


377
0:15:57,65 --> 0:15:58,74
We've proven that.


378
0:15:58,74 --> 0:16:1,7
Roughly 60 right wing terrorist
plots have been


379
0:16:1,7 --> 0:16:3,32
uncovered in the United States
according to an upcoming


380
0:16:3,32 --> 0:16:4,91
report of the Southern
Poverty Law Center's


381
0:16:4,91 --> 0:16:6,67
intelligence project.


382
0:16:6,67 --> 0:16:9,61
The media's saying the Tea
Parties are evil terrorists


383
0:16:9,61 --> 0:16:12,27
who are basically cop killers is
what they're trying to say.


384
0:16:12,27 --> 0:16:13,96
And they're a bunch of right
wingers when it isn't about


385
0:16:13,96 --> 0:16:14,69
left and right.


386
0:16:14,69 --> 0:16:17,506
They're desperate to divide
the American people.


387
0:16:17,506 --> 0:16:20,218



388
0:16:20,218 --> 0:16:21,8
CINDY MALLETTE: Barack Obama's
Department of Homeland


389
0:16:21,8 --> 0:16:26,39
Security, you may have heard,
is trying to classify us as


390
0:16:26,39 --> 0:16:29,545
right wing extremists, trying to
warn people to be aware of


391
0:16:29,545 --> 0:16:30,968
people like us.


392
0:16:30,968 --> 0:16:32,64
-Boo.


393
0:16:32,64 --> 0:16:34,7
CINDY MALLETTE: Yeah, boo.


394
0:16:34,7 --> 0:16:37,86
The real people we need to be
fearing are our so called


395
0:16:37,86 --> 0:16:38,78
elected officials in


396
0:16:38,78 --> 0:16:42,72
Washington D.C. -Amen.


397
0:16:42,72 --> 0:16:43,725
CINDY MALLETTE: That's right.


398
0:16:43,725 --> 0:16:46,33
-I do not believe in political
correctness.


399
0:16:46,33 --> 0:16:47,12
And if somebody--


400
0:16:47,12 --> 0:16:49,9
I don't care if he wears a
badge or a gun or what.


401
0:16:49,9 --> 0:16:51,56
If he does something wrong, I'm
going to be right in his


402
0:16:51,56 --> 0:16:52,54
face telling him.


403
0:16:52,54 --> 0:16:53,93
And, well, I guess I'm a


404
0:16:53,93 --> 0:16:56,41
terrorist because I'm pro-life.


405
0:16:56,41 --> 0:16:57,92
-Say one word and they
mow you down.


406
0:16:57,92 --> 0:16:59,2
-Yeah, you know--


407
0:16:59,2 --> 0:16:59,56
-They'll mow you down.


408
0:16:59,56 --> 0:17:1,65
-Die for God.


409
0:17:1,65 --> 0:17:5,849
Die for the right reasons
and it's OK.


410
0:17:5,849 --> 0:17:8,619
-Somebody just came up to the
stage and said we have


411
0:17:8,619 --> 0:17:12,859
pictures of them taking
pictures of us.


412
0:17:12,859 --> 0:17:15,722
Just call me paranoid, but that
just doesn't look like


413
0:17:15,722 --> 0:17:17,0
the local news network.


414
0:17:17,0 --> 0:17:19,68



415
0:17:19,68 --> 0:17:23,0
Let them know you're not a
threat, you have a valid


416
0:17:23,0 --> 0:17:26,21
driver's license on you, and
your passport is safely at


417
0:17:26,21 --> 0:17:29,32
home, and you love America.


418
0:17:29,32 --> 0:17:29,86
Isn't that perfect?


419
0:17:29,86 --> 0:17:32,34
There's a bald eagle and there's
Homeland Security.


420
0:17:32,34 --> 0:17:34,978



421
0:17:34,978 --> 0:17:37,36
Everybody just wave at them real
big so they get a good


422
0:17:37,36 --> 0:17:38,286
picture of us.


423
0:17:38,286 --> 0:17:40,92



424
0:17:40,92 --> 0:17:43,5
ALEX JONES: It says the number
one threat is returning


425
0:17:43,5 --> 0:17:45,19
troops, gun owners,
people buying all


426
0:17:45,19 --> 0:17:46,34
these guns and ammo.


427
0:17:46,34 --> 0:17:48,33
This is the number one
terror threat.


428
0:17:48,33 --> 0:17:49,58
That is a quote.


429
0:17:49,58 --> 0:17:53,11
And they have really
upset people.


430
0:17:53,11 --> 0:17:58,33
CHRIS HEDGES: Alienation and
anger is one that is very


431
0:17:58,33 --> 0:18:0,63
common among returning
veterans.


432
0:18:0,63 --> 0:18:4,11
You saw it after the
Vietnam War.


433
0:18:4,11 --> 0:18:7,34
You're seeing it with these
guys, men and women that are


434
0:18:7,34 --> 0:18:8,97
coming back.


435
0:18:8,97 --> 0:18:13,21
And when you couple that with
a societal breakdown that


436
0:18:13,21 --> 0:18:17,9
essentially denies them the
possibility of reintegrating


437
0:18:17,9 --> 0:18:22,8
into the society, then you are
very volatile and toxic mix.


438
0:18:22,8 --> 0:18:26,66



439
0:18:26,66 --> 0:18:28,23
SGT. CHARLES DYER: It's
like Vietnam.


440
0:18:28,23 --> 0:18:29,51
It's not a winnable war.


441
0:18:29,51 --> 0:18:30,73
It's just sustainable.


442
0:18:30,73 --> 0:18:32,42
The longer we stay over
there, the more debt


443
0:18:32,42 --> 0:18:35,35
they can put on us.


444
0:18:35,35 --> 0:18:37,18
Look at-- what did the
President say?


445
0:18:37,18 --> 0:18:38,77
We were going to be out of there
as soon as he got in


446
0:18:38,77 --> 0:18:39,81
office pretty much?


447
0:18:39,81 --> 0:18:41,42
How long has he been
president now?


448
0:18:41,42 --> 0:18:43,436
And we're still in Iraq.


449
0:18:43,436 --> 0:18:46,13
I saw some stuff over there that
kind of changed my mind.


450
0:18:46,13 --> 0:18:49,35
We lost a good marine.


451
0:18:49,35 --> 0:18:52,3
I sat there and I kept
staring at the bodies


452
0:18:52,3 --> 0:18:53,6
that were laying around.


453
0:18:53,6 --> 0:18:56,42
And it kind of hit me that these
guys are nothing but me.


454
0:18:56,42 --> 0:18:58,3
They're not terrorists.


455
0:18:58,3 --> 0:19:0,32
They're guys that are defending
their country.


456
0:19:0,32 --> 0:19:1,91
They're not terrorists.


457
0:19:1,91 --> 0:19:4,0
The guys in Afghanistan,
they're not terrorists.


458
0:19:4,0 --> 0:19:5,2
They're defending their country


459
0:19:5,2 --> 0:19:6,4
from a foreign invasion.


460
0:19:6,4 --> 0:19:8,31
We create terrorists.


461
0:19:8,31 --> 0:19:11,36
You come into my house and you
kill my wife, you kill my


462
0:19:11,36 --> 0:19:14,2
daughter, you kill any part of
my family, and I'm probably


463
0:19:14,2 --> 0:19:16,72
going to strap on a suicide
vest, go to one of your


464
0:19:16,72 --> 0:19:17,97
checkpoints.


465
0:19:17,97 --> 0:19:21,57
So that's what we're creating
over there in my mind.


466
0:19:21,57 --> 0:19:25,82
That's all I have to say about
that situation for the moment.


467
0:19:25,82 --> 0:19:28,57
CHRIS HEDGES: When you go into
combat, you come back, you not


468
0:19:28,57 --> 0:19:32,45
only suffer from trauma, but if
you become self aware, you


469
0:19:32,45 --> 0:19:35,53
suffer a tremendous existential
crisis.


470
0:19:35,53 --> 0:19:38,6
You realize that all the things
you were taught by both


471
0:19:38,6 --> 0:19:42,64
religious and secular
institutions are a lie.


472
0:19:42,64 --> 0:19:45,24
And it's very, very hard to
adjust because when you come


473
0:19:45,24 --> 0:19:53,31
back that truth, the kind of
prophetic truth, is very


474
0:19:53,31 --> 0:19:57,57
difficult for people who have
not been to war to hear.


475
0:19:57,57 --> 0:20:2,28
You are really a stranger
in a strange land.


476
0:20:2,28 --> 0:20:5,27
SGT. CHARLES DYER: Patriots,
we are not overpowered.


477
0:20:5,27 --> 0:20:8,69
If we unite under one banner of
freedom and fight for our


478
0:20:8,69 --> 0:20:12,496
children's liberty and the
defense of the Constitution,


479
0:20:12,496 --> 0:20:16,85
our resolve is invincible
to any standing army.


480
0:20:16,85 --> 0:20:19,74
They might be able to take the
very breath from our lungs,


481
0:20:19,74 --> 0:20:24,39
but they can never rip the
freedoms from our souls.


482
0:20:24,39 --> 0:20:27,87
CHRIS HEDGES: Rhetoric and
language is not benign.


483
0:20:27,87 --> 0:20:30,12
You have to get people to talk
in the language of violence


484
0:20:30,12 --> 0:20:32,22
before they commit violence.


485
0:20:32,22 --> 0:20:34,63
-Good evening, ladies and
gentleman, [INAUDIBLE]


486
0:20:34,63 --> 0:20:37,522
town watchmen.


487
0:20:37,522 --> 0:20:40,896
I got one question to
begin this video.


488
0:20:40,896 --> 0:20:45,14
I mean, you got to ask yourself,
tonight, are you


489
0:20:45,14 --> 0:20:47,26
felling lucky new world order?


490
0:20:47,26 --> 0:20:50,76
-It's all part of a plan that's
been in the works for


491
0:20:50,76 --> 0:20:52,99
many years, the new
world order.


492
0:20:52,99 --> 0:20:56,61
And I just want to be
a part of this.


493
0:20:56,61 --> 0:20:58,74
I'm really more of a follower.


494
0:20:58,74 --> 0:21:1,74
-I think that more women,
especially young women, need


495
0:21:1,74 --> 0:21:4,66
to get more involved in this,
probably going out and


496
0:21:4,66 --> 0:21:8,4
learning how to work the Mosberg
Model 88 pump action


497
0:21:8,4 --> 0:21:10,43
12 gauge shot gun to
protect yourself.


498
0:21:10,43 --> 0:21:13,41
And we need to fight alongside
our men and our friends and


499
0:21:13,41 --> 0:21:17,89
our families for our freedom
and the Constitution.


500
0:21:17,89 --> 0:21:18,74
-We don't play games.


501
0:21:18,74 --> 0:21:21,39
We quit school because
it had a recess.


502
0:21:21,39 --> 0:21:24,4
You put us out of work and
you stole our pensions.


503
0:21:24,4 --> 0:21:26,9
So we found us a new job.


504
0:21:26,9 --> 0:21:28,12
It's called chewing chewing
gum and kicking butt.


505
0:21:28,12 --> 0:21:29,302
And guess what?


506
0:21:29,302 --> 0:21:32,218
I'm about on my last piece
of chewing gum.


507
0:21:32,218 --> 0:21:35,66
And I know you've done
strategic stuff.


508
0:21:35,66 --> 0:21:37,33
And I've got the documents right
here in front of me.


509
0:21:37,33 --> 0:21:40,398
Let me move this 50 caliber
right here, and I'll shell up


510
0:21:40,398 --> 0:21:42,13
your nose and blow you away
if you mess with American


511
0:21:42,13 --> 0:21:42,48
patriot.


512
0:21:42,48 --> 0:21:45,4
-Now, listen, I love
my country.


513
0:21:45,4 --> 0:21:47,32
And that's why I have to
discourage people from joining


514
0:21:47,32 --> 0:21:49,88
the military with this guy
in the White House.


515
0:21:49,88 --> 0:21:52,21
If you want to protect
your country, join


516
0:21:52,21 --> 0:21:54,48
them or start a militia.


517
0:21:54,48 --> 0:21:57,68
But you don't want Obama to be
your commander in chief.


518
0:21:57,68 --> 0:22:0,66



519
0:22:0,66 --> 0:22:3,55
CHRIS HEDGES: So you have these
forces unleashed and


520
0:22:3,55 --> 0:22:8,79
amplified by a mass media in a
society that stands on the


521
0:22:8,79 --> 0:22:10,41
cusp of disintegration.


522
0:22:10,41 --> 0:22:12,84
And remember that within
American society there's a


523
0:22:12,84 --> 0:22:15,13
deep undercurrent of violence.


524
0:22:15,13 --> 0:22:15,854
SGT. CHARLES DYER: Back in the
90's there was a militia


525
0:22:15,854 --> 0:22:17,99
movement where a lot of people
got together doing the same


526
0:22:17,99 --> 0:22:20,78
thing that we're doing
now, training.


527
0:22:20,78 --> 0:22:23,21
A lot of it was more weekend
warriors, really, though


528
0:22:23,21 --> 0:22:27,2
because as soon as Timothy
McVeigh and those ass clowns


529
0:22:27,2 --> 0:22:30,9
went and blew up buildings and
killed innocent children.


530
0:22:30,9 --> 0:22:33,36
And the government tries
to blame the militia


531
0:22:33,36 --> 0:22:34,72
movement for that.


532
0:22:34,72 --> 0:22:37,5
No matter what, in any movement,
any group, there's


533
0:22:37,5 --> 0:22:37,89
always going to be crazies.


534
0:22:37,89 --> 0:22:40,61
There's always going to be the
people that are extreme one


535
0:22:40,61 --> 0:22:42,62
way or the other and they think
that killing people,


536
0:22:42,62 --> 0:22:45,12
just killing people period is
going to make a difference.


537
0:22:45,12 --> 0:22:46,23
And it's not.


538
0:22:46,23 --> 0:22:48,48
It's absolutely not.


539
0:22:48,48 --> 0:22:50,52
ALEX JONES: For those that don't
understand this, we are


540
0:22:50,52 --> 0:22:52,17
at a historic crossroads.


541
0:22:52,17 --> 0:22:55,31
And I can see in their eyes and
their actions, I realize


542
0:22:55,31 --> 0:22:56,72
they're actually intimidated.


543
0:22:56,72 --> 0:22:58,59
They realize that they've
put their


544
0:22:58,59 --> 0:23:0,71
criminal action into motion.


545
0:23:0,71 --> 0:23:2,86
It's a machine they
can't turn off.


546
0:23:2,86 --> 0:23:5,77
And I think they're starting
to brace for the fact--


547
0:23:5,77 --> 0:23:6,83
I mean, it's like when
you get into fights.


548
0:23:6,83 --> 0:23:9,14
Some bully punches you and then
you gear up and start


549
0:23:9,14 --> 0:23:9,81
punching back.


550
0:23:9,81 --> 0:23:11,99
And you can tell you're going
to whip their ass.


551
0:23:11,99 --> 0:23:13,59
I mean, that's the feeling
right here.


552
0:23:13,59 --> 0:23:15,8
We are going to lick the
new world order's butt.


553
0:23:15,8 --> 0:23:18,43



554
0:23:18,43 --> 0:23:19,51
SGT. CHARLES DYER: There's no
way we're going to be able to


555
0:23:19,51 --> 0:23:21,28
get [INAUDIBLE]


556
0:23:21,28 --> 0:23:24,35
unless we go way back here.


557
0:23:24,35 --> 0:23:26,585
There's some people that think
something's going to happen


558
0:23:26,585 --> 0:23:28,27
within the next two months.


559
0:23:28,27 --> 0:23:29,53
There's some people that think
something's going to


560
0:23:29,53 --> 0:23:30,38
happen in two years.


561
0:23:30,38 --> 0:23:32,66
There's some people that think
nothing will ever happen.


562
0:23:32,66 --> 0:23:36,23
So, I guess, time is the only
thing that can answer that.


563
0:23:36,23 --> 0:23:38,66
CHRIS HEDGES: We are headed
to civil unrest.


564
0:23:38,66 --> 0:23:41,38
We have dis-empowered our
working class and there are


565
0:23:41,38 --> 0:23:43,63
whole pockets now in the United
States that resemble


566
0:23:43,63 --> 0:23:46,14
the third world, where the end
of the world is no longer an


567
0:23:46,14 --> 0:23:47,24
abstraction.


568
0:23:47,24 --> 0:23:50,58
Violence is a kind of cleansing
agent because the


569
0:23:50,58 --> 0:23:53,24
world around them is one
that has betrayed them


570
0:23:53,24 --> 0:23:54,47
and that they hate.


571
0:23:54,47 --> 0:23:58,22
And that is the lure of
apocalyptic violence.


572
0:23:58,22 --> 0:24:1,41
It eradicates what almost
destroyed me.


573
0:24:1,41 --> 0:24:2,97
SGT. CHARLES DYER: I just want
to ask the American people to


574
0:24:2,97 --> 0:24:5,8
wake up and see what's
going on around you.


575
0:24:5,8 --> 0:24:7,404
Walk outside and stop playing
your video games.


576
0:24:7,404 --> 0:24:8,7
Stop watching your TV.


577
0:24:8,7 --> 0:24:12,12
CHRIS HEDGES: In a corporate
state the interests and needs


578
0:24:12,12 --> 0:24:14,1
of citizens don't matter.


579
0:24:14,1 --> 0:24:18,96
You need to destroy the machine
because if we don't


580
0:24:18,96 --> 0:24:21,58
destroy the machine, the
machine's going to destroy us.


581
0:24:21,58 --> 0:24:23,59
It is destroying us.


582
0:24:23,59 --> 0:24:26,83
SGT. CHARLES DYER: Vote and
become politically involved or


583
0:24:26,83 --> 0:24:29,62
start a militia, which
is very important.


584
0:24:29,62 --> 0:24:30,59
Do something.


585
0:24:30,59 --> 0:24:32,41
Do something to make yourselves
better and more


586
0:24:32,41 --> 0:24:35,68
prepared for what
may be coming.

CHRIS HEDGES: Violence
isn't going to work.


588
0:24:37,515 --> 0:24:39,44
Violence is a mistake.


589
0:24:39,44 --> 0:24:43,6
Machine wants violence, it
justifies further oppression.

SGT. CHARLES DYER: I'm not going
to be hiding from my


591
0:24:44,58 --> 0:24:45,38
command anymore.


592
0:24:45,38 --> 0:24:46,71
And I'm sure not hiding
from ATF.


593
0:24:46,71 --> 0:24:48,44
I'm not hiding from FBI.


594
0:24:48,44 --> 0:24:50,9
I'm not hiding from
any organization.


595
0:24:50,9 --> 0:24:52,48
If they want to come take me,
I'm not going to be afraid.


596
0:24:52,48 --> 0:24:55,13
If I'm afraid to that point,
we're in a tyrannical


597
0:24:55,13 --> 0:24:58,1
government in the first place
and people need to rise up.


598
0:24:58,1 --> 0:25:0,503
At that point, there needs to
be a violent revolution.


599
