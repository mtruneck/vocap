1
0:0:2,5 --> 0:0:7,749
Most people are not really hurt by the world.


2
0:0:7,749 --> 0:0:12,272
They're hurt by their own expectations.


3
0:0:12,272 --> 0:0:18,227
I read somewhere that H.G. Wells was very disappointed in people.


4
0:0:18,227 --> 0:0:23,118
He thought that we would have arrived at more of a scientific community


5
0:0:23,118 --> 0:0:25,79
than what we have today


6
0:0:25,79 --> 0:0:29,321
but what hurt him was not the world.


7
0:0:29,321 --> 0:0:31,705
It was his expectations.


8
0:0:31,705 --> 0:0:35,393
He expected people to lean more toward science


9
0:0:35,393 --> 0:0:38,317
and less toward metaphysics.


10
0:0:38,317 --> 0:0:42,92
He suspected that the system


11
0:0:42,92 --> 0:0:46,973
would gather intelligence and know the right direction.


12
0:0:46,973 --> 0:0:51,661
So what really hurt him was his own expectations.


13
0:0:51,661 --> 0:0:54,721
The real answer to that question is:


14
0:0:54,721 --> 0:0:58,56
Whatever happens in the world is real.


15
0:0:58,56 --> 0:1:2,533
What you think should happen is not real.


16
0:1:2,533 --> 0:1:5,143
So you're not disappointed by the world.


17
0:1:5,143 --> 0:1:8,692
You're disappointed by your own projections.


18
0:1:8,692 --> 0:1:12,386
If you meet a person, you say "There's a wonderful person"


19
0:1:12,386 --> 0:1:15,901
and they turn out to be different than you suspected


20
0:1:15,901 --> 0:1:18,986
you get mad, and you say "She isn't that wonderful"


21
0:1:18,986 --> 0:1:21,73
or "He isn't that wonderful"


22
0:1:21,73 --> 0:1:25,441
and it's your own projections that you're mad at.


23
0:1:25,441 --> 0:1:27,629
The right way to look at a person is:


24
0:1:27,629 --> 0:1:32,153
"I don't know enough about them to make a judgment."


25
0:1:32,153 --> 0:1:36,626
In time, when you make a judgment


26
0:1:36,626 --> 0:1:41,867
you say "Up to now, they appear to be so-so."


27
0:1:41,867 --> 0:1:47,85
But something may come back that reminds them of something else.


28
0:1:47,85 --> 0:1:50,892
So they hurt you. They really don't hurt you.


29
0:1:50,892 --> 0:1:55,754
They're normal. That is, normal to their values.


30
0:1:55,754 --> 0:1:58,268
Like my mother would believe in religion


31
0:1:58,268 --> 0:2:1,824
because it's normal to her background


32
0:2:1,824 --> 0:2:5,486
and when things get tough, she prays, rather then


33
0:2:5,486 --> 0:2:9,521
because she doesn't know what else to do.


34
0:2:9,521 --> 0:2:12,475
What you have to do is take time out


35
0:2:12,475 --> 0:2:16,853
and try to inform people as to how to look at things.


36
0:2:16,853 --> 0:2:21,89
It may take you two or three years to do that


37
0:2:21,89 --> 0:2:25,52
but we would expect to find people that understand what we say.


38
0:2:25,52 --> 0:2:28,94
When they shake their heads like "Yes"


39
0:2:28,94 --> 0:2:30,579
that doesn't mean they understand.


40
0:2:30,579 --> 0:2:33,948
It means they understand a limited amount.


41
0:2:33,948 --> 0:2:36,831
So, the point is:


42
0:2:36,831 --> 0:2:39,717
What are your expectations?


43
0:2:39,717 --> 0:2:42,267
Now, in chemistry, if you mix certain things together


44
0:2:42,267 --> 0:2:46,8
certain things happen, at a certain temperature.


45
0:2:46,8 --> 0:2:49,265
At different temperatures, the same thing doesn't happen.


46
0:2:49,265 --> 0:2:52,546
You can get mad and throw the experiment on the floor


47
0:2:52,546 --> 0:2:55,584
if you don't follow the rules.


48
0:2:55,584 --> 0:2:59,708
So if a person wants to be more analytical


49
0:2:59,708 --> 0:3:2,969
they have to learn how to say "I don't know"


50
0:3:2,969 --> 0:3:8,25
or "Up to now, everything seems to be OK.


51
0:3:8,25 --> 0:3:12,646
My relationship seems to work out in many different areas


52
0:3:12,646 --> 0:3:15,772
or more areas than I expected."


53
0:3:15,772 --> 0:3:18,5
Sometimes we're pleasantly surprised


54
0:3:18,5 --> 0:3:23,372
by the reaction of people we had a negative view of.


55
0:3:23,372 --> 0:3:26,759
I may have a negative view of you


56
0:3:26,759 --> 0:3:30,43
but in time, observing what you do


57
0:3:30,43 --> 0:3:32,997
my negative view becomes a positive view.


58
0:3:32,997 --> 0:3:36,957
But if I have a negative view, it means I was projecting.


59
0:3:36,957 --> 0:3:40,209
I really don't know. So the point is


60
0:3:40,209 --> 0:3:43,25
when events occur that are tough


61
0:3:43,25 --> 0:3:46,265
if a person deserts you at that time


62
0:3:46,265 --> 0:3:50,197
you'll understand that they can't live under those conditions.


63
0:3:50,197 --> 0:3:55,611
They're not bad people. They revert back to their conditioning.


64
0:3:55,611 --> 0:3:59,471
Now, "reverting back to their conditioning" means


65
0:3:59,471 --> 0:4:2,95
if the world is catastrophic


66
0:4:2,95 --> 0:4:6,444
if a man is shot, he's laying in the battlefield


67
0:4:6,444 --> 0:4:11,659
he says "I hope the first-aid people come soon. I don't feel very good."


68
0:4:11,659 --> 0:4:17,66
If they don't come soon, he says "Where the hell are they?"


69
0:4:17,66 --> 0:4:19,828
He expected them to come sooner


70
0:4:19,828 --> 0:4:24,99
but they come as soon as they can come, whenever that is.


71
0:4:24,99 --> 0:4:28,245
And if you can't take it, you can swear all you want to


72
0:4:28,245 --> 0:4:32,881
but if you continue to swear and continue to get angry


73
0:4:32,881 --> 0:4:36,939
they're apt to arrive during that period.


74
0:4:36,939 --> 0:4:39,727
And you say "Well, it's my prayers


75
0:4:39,727 --> 0:4:44,32
because I hoped they'd come and rescue me.


76
0:4:44,32 --> 0:4:46,221
That goes for...


77
0:4:46,221 --> 0:4:49,24
H.G. Wells had a scene in the movie


78
0:4:49,24 --> 0:4:52,935
I think it was called "The Shape of Things to Come"


79
0:4:52,935 --> 0:4:57,958
in which a pilot shot down a German pilot or another pilot


80
0:4:57,958 --> 0:5:0,622
and he went over to the plane crash


81
0:5:0,622 --> 0:5:4,186
and the guy was very ill.


82
0:5:4,186 --> 0:5:7,89
He couldn't leave. He says "The plane is going to explode


83
0:5:7,89 --> 0:5:11,53
and I'm badly damaged. So


84
0:5:11,53 --> 0:5:14,796
this guy gave him a gun to shoot himself.


85
0:5:14,796 --> 0:5:17,702
In the motion picture "Airmail"


86
0:5:17,702 --> 0:5:22,423
there was a guy caught in an airplane. [He] couldn't get out. [It] was burning


87
0:5:22,423 --> 0:5:25,988
so the guy shot him twice. The guy loved him


88
0:5:25,988 --> 0:5:29,13
but he didn't want him to burn to death.


89
0:5:29,13 --> 0:5:32,6
Is that murder? What is it?


90
0:5:32,6 --> 0:5:35,907
If anybody claimed he was suffering so much from cancer


91
0:5:35,907 --> 0:5:39,454
I shot him. Is that love?


92
0:5:39,454 --> 0:5:42,216
How do you talk about love?


93
0:5:42,216 --> 0:5:45,313
Do you know what I mean? If a person is suffering from cancer


94
0:5:45,313 --> 0:5:48,145
he says "Please, take my life.


95
0:5:48,145 --> 0:5:51,645
The doctor says "I can live three months with this condition."


96
0:5:51,645 --> 0:5:54,523
And you hear him crying out, suffering


97
0:5:54,523 --> 0:5:59,2
and you shoot him. Are you a murderer? Are you kind?


98
0:5:59,2 --> 0:6:2,461
All those words are very difficult to deal with.


99
0:6:2,461 --> 0:6:4,606
It depends on the situation.


100
0:6:4,606 --> 0:6:7,817
It depends on how attached you are to the person.


101
0:6:7,817 --> 0:6:11,892
If you don't give a damn about their suffering. You know what I mean?


102
0:6:11,892 --> 0:6:16,48
So people begged certain doctors to take their lives.


103
0:6:16,48 --> 0:6:20,735
They were suffering too much. It was too much on their family.


104
0:6:20,735 --> 0:6:25,116
They didn't have a bank account to pay for this medical condition


105
0:6:25,116 --> 0:6:28,634
that they were under. They said "Please, end my life


106
0:6:28,634 --> 0:6:31,88
because the pain is unbearable."


107
0:6:31,88 --> 0:6:35,255
And the Bible says you're not supposed to take a life


108
0:6:35,255 --> 0:6:37,433
no matter what the pain is.


109
0:6:37,433 --> 0:6:42,313
That's your entry into heaven, especially in India.


110
0:6:42,313 --> 0:6:47,262
If a person's suffering a great deal, they're paying off their karma.


111
0:6:47,262 --> 0:6:52,816
If you end that, you shoot them, they can't pay off their karma.


112
0:6:52,816 --> 0:6:55,659
So, you've got all these crazy things


113
0:6:55,659 --> 0:6:58,607
that you are exposed to


114
0:6:58,607 --> 0:7:2,543
and you use your logic, thinking that it makes sense.


115
0:7:2,543 --> 0:7:6,924
It only makes sense if a person says "I see your point


116
0:7:6,924 --> 0:7:10,293
but I'm unable to accept it emotionally."


117
0:7:10,293 --> 0:7:13,96
There are people like that, that can't do that.


118
0:7:13,96 --> 0:7:16,442
They can't shoot their father, even though he's suffering


119
0:7:16,442 --> 0:7:19,223
because it says "Thou shalt not kill"


120
0:7:19,223 --> 0:7:22,777
and they figure that even if they shot their father that was suffering


121
0:7:22,777 --> 0:7:26,897
they've committed a crime against God.


122
0:7:26,897 --> 0:7:31,908
So remember, it's your own expectations that hurt you


123
0:7:31,908 --> 0:7:36,804
not the world you live in. Whatever happens in the world is real.


124
0:7:36,804 --> 0:7:40,365
What you think should happen is unreal.


125
0:7:40,365 --> 0:7:43,583
So people are hurt by their expectations.


126
0:7:43,583 --> 0:7:48,1
Any questions about that?


127
0:7:48,1 --> 0:7:53,346
If you have reasonable expectations such as "I don't know"


128
0:7:53,346 --> 0:7:58,89
then whatever happens, you say "I didn't think it would be that bad."


129
0:7:58,89 --> 0:8:0,303
How do you know how bad it would be?


130
0:8:0,303 --> 0:8:3,482
Whatever happens, no matter how bad it is


131
0:8:3,482 --> 0:8:6,842
if fifty kids are killed in a bus crash


132
0:8:6,842 --> 0:8:9,553
that's a problem. Why were they killed?


133
0:8:9,553 --> 0:8:14,47
The bus slipped off an icy highway. What can you do about it?


134
0:8:14,47 --> 0:8:18,901
I don't know. And the condition will prevail


135
0:8:18,901 --> 0:8:23,775
unless you come up with a new way of friction tires


136
0:8:23,775 --> 0:8:27,341
that can't skid on icy highways.


137
0:8:27,341 --> 0:8:30,297
That's the best you can do. But if you made those tires


138
0:8:30,297 --> 0:8:34,106
and you put them on the bus, and the bus still slipped


139
0:8:34,106 --> 0:8:36,315
it means you got more to go.


140
0:8:36,315 --> 0:8:40,452
You can't say "I made ice tires that won't slip."


141
0:8:40,452 --> 0:8:45,961
That's a projection, unless you tested it out many times.


142
0:8:45,961 --> 0:8:47,807
Do you understand?


143
0:8:47,807 --> 0:8:50,265
So what does man really want?


144
0:8:50,265 --> 0:8:54,501
He really wants accurate predictability.


145
0:8:54,501 --> 0:8:57,965
You cannot achieve that unless you're technical.


146
0:8:57,965 --> 0:9:0,22
...accurate predictability.


147
0:9:0,22 --> 0:9:2,447
If an engine fails it means


148
0:9:2,447 --> 0:9:6,897
there's something wrong with a fuel pump, or any number of things.


149
0:9:6,897 --> 0:9:9,661
If you can't attend to those things


150
0:9:9,661 --> 0:9:13,872
then the probability is that at some time or other


151
0:9:13,872 --> 0:9:17,46
the engine will fail.


152
0:9:17,46 --> 0:9:21,764
Now, I don't expect you to walk around accepting everything that happens.


153
0:9:21,764 --> 0:9:26,79
I expect you to be angered and say "What can I do about it?


154
0:9:26,79 --> 0:9:32,85
I don't know, but I'm going to try. I'm going to try to make it possible


155
0:9:32,85 --> 0:9:34,778
for people not to be injured.


156
0:9:34,778 --> 0:9:37,812
I'm going to try to design a conveyor


157
0:9:37,812 --> 0:9:41,795
that's on the tracks and under the tracks, that's locked


158
0:9:41,795 --> 0:9:44,612
so even in an amusement park


159
0:9:44,612 --> 0:9:47,499
the loop-da-loop can't go off the tracks


160
0:9:47,499 --> 0:9:50,364
because it's got under-braces."


161
0:9:50,364 --> 0:9:52,617
The under-braces may be perfect


162
0:9:52,617 --> 0:9:55,729
but the structure of the unit may not be.


163
0:9:55,729 --> 0:10:0,46
So, to the ability of an individual


164
0:10:0,46 --> 0:10:4,844
to handle all those things is very difficult


165
0:10:4,844 --> 0:10:12,523
but he only knows, or she only knows, what to handle after the event.


166
0:10:12,523 --> 0:10:17,441
The event has to occur first, then the person makes a safety device


167
0:10:17,441 --> 0:10:21,215
and he solved that problem, but there may be other problems


168
0:10:21,215 --> 0:10:24,502
and another event may occur that's negative.


169
0:10:24,502 --> 0:10:26,998
And the person says "What can I do about it?


170
0:10:26,998 --> 0:10:30,547
I don't know enough about it. I'm going to read up on it


171
0:10:30,547 --> 0:10:33,994
and try to become familiar with the nature of the problem


172
0:10:33,994 --> 0:10:36,667
and try to solve it" and


173
0:10:36,667 --> 0:10:40,159
when a person says to you "Have you solved it?


174
0:10:40,159 --> 0:10:43,656
This is the device. I made in an attempt to solve it.


175
0:10:43,656 --> 0:10:48,83
Will it work? Well, according to the tests I did, it will."


176
0:10:48,83 --> 0:10:53,253
But in reality, it was cold and the oil didn't flow


177
0:10:53,253 --> 0:10:56,841
so the thing wasn't lubricated, and it didn't work.


178
0:10:56,841 --> 0:11:0,314
There are other factors you learned about later on.


179
0:11:0,314 --> 0:11:3,146
That's called "after the facts".


180
0:11:3,146 --> 0:11:6,155
So some people get mad at technicians and say


181
0:11:6,155 --> 0:11:11,568
"You're a technician. Why did that thing fail?" "What do you suggest?"


182
0:11:11,568 --> 0:11:14,118
is what you put to that person.


183
0:11:14,118 --> 0:11:18,143
If they say "You designed that unit and it failed."


184
0:11:18,143 --> 0:11:22,9
"Yes it did fail, apparently I didn't know enough about


185
0:11:22,9 --> 0:11:25,44
solving that problem. What do you suggest?


186
0:11:25,44 --> 0:11:27,56
Don't get mad at me. What do you suggest?


187
0:11:27,56 --> 0:11:31,85
You've done nothing but expect me to solve the problem."
