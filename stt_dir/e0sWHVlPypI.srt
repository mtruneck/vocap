1
0:0:25,8 --> 0:0:31,1
- The old appeals to racial,
sexual and religious chauvinism


2
0:0:31,1 --> 0:0:35,1
to rabid nationalist fervor
are beginning not to work.


3
0:0:35,1 --> 0:0:38,14
-The business of who I am
and whether I'm good or bad


4
0:0:38,14 --> 0:0:41,1
or achieving or not, all
that's learned along the way.


5
0:0:41,1 --> 0:0:42,84
-It's just a ride


6
0:0:42,84 --> 0:0:46,35
and we can change it anytime we want.
It's only a choice.


7
0:0:46,35 --> 0:0:49,22
No effort, no work, no job,
no savings of money.


8
0:0:49,22 --> 0:0:51,951
-I realized that I
had the game wrong


9
0:0:51,951 --> 0:1:58,9
that the game was to find
out what I already was.


10
0:1:58,9 --> 0:2:2,0
-We were saying,


11
0:2:2,0 --> 0:2:5,5
how very important it is


12
0:2:5,5 --> 0:2:9,362
to bring about,
in the human mind


13
0:2:9,362 --> 0:2:13,967
the radical revolution.


14
0:2:13,967 --> 0:2:23,3
The crisis is a crisis
in consciousness.


15
0:2:23,3 --> 0:2:30,2
A crisis that cannot, anymore


16
0:2:30,2 --> 0:2:32,952
accept the old norms


17
0:2:32,952 --> 0:2:36,2
the old patterns


18
0:2:36,2 --> 0:2:40,54
the ancient traditions.


19
0:2:40,54 --> 0:2:47,734
And, considering what
the world is now


20
0:2:47,734 --> 0:2:49,936
with all the misery


21
0:2:49,936 --> 0:2:52,438
conflict


22
0:2:52,438 --> 0:2:54,941
destructive brutality


23
0:2:54,941 --> 0:2:56,943
aggression


24
0:2:56,943 --> 0:3:0,513
and so on...


25
0:3:0,513 --> 0:3:2,7
Man


26
0:3:2,7 --> 0:3:5,952
is still as he was.


27
0:3:5,952 --> 0:3:7,954
Is still brutal


28
0:3:7,954 --> 0:3:9,9
violent


29
0:3:9,9 --> 0:3:10,43
aggressive


30
0:3:10,43 --> 0:3:12,1
acquisitive


31
0:3:12,1 --> 0:3:14,26
competitive.


32
0:3:14,26 --> 0:3:22,0
And, he's built a society
along these lines.


33
0:3:22,0 --> 0:3:38,48

ZEITGEIST ADDENDUM

"It is no measure of
health to be well adjusted


36
0:4:11,25 --> 0:4:25,965
to a profoundly sick society.
" J. Krishnamurti


37
0:4:25,965 --> 0:4:30,29
-Society today, is composed
of a series of institutions.


38
0:4:30,29 --> 0:4:31,33
.


39
0:4:31,33 --> 0:4:32,939
From political institutions


40
0:4:32,939 --> 0:4:34,57
legal institutions


41
0:4:34,57 --> 0:4:36,609
religious institutions.


42
0:4:36,609 --> 0:4:38,645
To institutions of social class


43
0:4:38,645 --> 0:4:40,14
familial values


44
0:4:40,14 --> 0:4:42,515
and occupational specialization.


45
0:4:42,515 --> 0:4:44,63
It is obvious the
profound influence


46
0:4:44,63 --> 0:4:46,82
these traditionalized
structures have


47
0:4:46,82 --> 0:4:51,491
in shaping our understandings
and perspectives.


48
0:4:51,491 --> 0:4:54,827
Yet, of all the social
institutions, we are born into


49
0:4:54,827 --> 0:4:57,797
directed by and conditioned upon


50
0:4:57,797 --> 0:5:0,55
there seems to be no system
as taken for granted


51
0:5:0,55 --> 0:5:2,43
and misunderstood


52
0:5:2,43 --> 0:5:5,0
as the monetary system.


53
0:5:5,0 --> 0:5:7,44
Taking on nearly
religious proportions


54
0:5:7,44 --> 0:5:10,2
the established monetary
institution exists


55
0:5:10,2 --> 0:5:14,25
as one of the most unquestioned
forms of faith there is.


56
0:5:14,25 --> 0:5:18,219
How money is created, the
policies by which it is governed


57
0:5:18,219 --> 0:5:18,22
.


58
0:5:18,22 --> 0:5:20,52
and how it truly affects society


59
0:5:20,52 --> 0:5:33,5
are unregistered interests of the
great majority of the population.


60
0:5:33,5 --> 0:5:38,75
In a world where 1% of the population
owns 40% of the planet's wealth.


61
0:5:38,75 --> 0:5:43,22
In a world where 34.000
children die every single day


62
0:5:43,22 --> 0:5:45,78
from poverty and
preventable diseases


63
0:5:45,78 --> 0:5:48,82
and where 50% of the
world's population


64
0:5:48,82 --> 0:5:51,53
lives on less than
2 dollars a day...


65
0:5:51,53 --> 0:5:53,62
One thing is clear.


66
0:5:53,62 --> 0:5:56,42
Something is very wrong.


67
0:5:56,42 --> 0:5:58,41
And, whether we are
aware of it or not


68
0:5:58,41 --> 0:6:1,35
the lifeblood of all of our
established institutions


69
0:6:1,35 --> 0:6:5,6
and thus society
itself, is money.


70
0:6:5,6 --> 0:6:9,1
Therefore, understanding this
institution of monetary policy


71
0:6:9,1 --> 0:6:13,66
is critical to understanding why
our lives are the way they are.


72
0:6:13,66 --> 0:6:17,95
Unfortunately, economics is often
viewed with confusion and boredom.


73
0:6:17,95 --> 0:6:20,12
Endless streams of
financial jargon


74
0:6:20,12 --> 0:6:22,2
coupled with
intimidating mathematics


75
0:6:22,2 --> 0:6:25,85
quickly deters people from
attempts at understanding it.


76
0:6:25,85 --> 0:6:27,63
However, the fact is:


77
0:6:27,63 --> 0:6:31,86
The complexity associated with the
financial system is a mere mask


78
0:6:31,86 --> 0:6:36,25
designed to conceal one of the most
socially paralyzing structures


79
0:6:36,25 --> 0:6:45,78
humanity has ever endured.


80
0:6:45,78 --> 0:6:49,22
"None are more
hopelessly enslaved


81
0:6:49,22 --> 0:6:53,5
than those who falsely
believe they are free."


82
0:6:53,5 --> 0:6:58,35
-Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
- 1749-1832


83
0:6:58,35 --> 0:6:59,95
-A number of years ago


84
0:6:59,95 --> 0:7:2,92
the central bank of the United
States, the Federal Reserve


85
0:7:2,92 --> 0:7:6,68
produced a document entitled
"Modern Money Mechanics".


86
0:7:6,68 --> 0:7:10,34
This publication detailed the
institutionalized practice


87
0:7:10,34 --> 0:7:13,55
of money creation as utilized
by the Federal Reserve


88
0:7:13,55 --> 0:7:16,38
and the web of global
commercial banks it supports.


89
0:7:16,38 --> 0:7:19,46
On the opening page the
document states its objective:


90
0:7:19,46 --> 0:7:21,5
"The purpose of this
booklet is to describe


91
0:7:21,5 --> 0:7:23,7
the basic process
of money creation


92
0:7:23,7 --> 0:7:26,46
in a 'fractional reserve'
banking system."


93
0:7:26,46 --> 0:7:30,7
It then proceeds to describe
this fractional reserve process


94
0:7:30,7 --> 0:7:32,7
through various
banking terminology.


95
0:7:32,7 --> 0:7:36,65
A translation of which
goes something like this:


96
0:7:36,65 --> 0:7:39,55
The United States government
decides it needs some money.


97
0:7:39,55 --> 0:7:41,24
So it calls up the
Federal Reserve


98
0:7:41,24 --> 0:7:44,3
and requests, say,
10 billion dollars.


99
0:7:44,3 --> 0:7:46,1
The FED replies saying:


100
0:7:46,1 --> 0:7:49,32
"Sure, we'll buy ten billion
in government bonds from you".


101
0:7:49,32 --> 0:7:52,19
So the government takes
some pieces of paper


102
0:7:52,19 --> 0:7:54,45
paints some official
looking designs on them


103
0:7:54,45 --> 0:7:56,52
and calls them treasury bonds.


104
0:7:56,52 --> 0:8:0,45
Then it puts a value on these bonds
to the sum of 10 billion dollars


105
0:8:0,45 --> 0:8:2,9
and sends them over to the FED.


106
0:8:2,9 --> 0:8:4,8
In turn, the people of the FED


107
0:8:4,8 --> 0:8:7,73
draw up a bunch of impressive
pieces of papers themselves


108
0:8:7,73 --> 0:8:10,86
only this time, calling them
"Federal Reserve notes"


109
0:8:10,86 --> 0:8:14,95
also designating a value of ten
billion dollars to the set.


110
0:8:14,95 --> 0:8:18,8
The FED then takes these notes
and trades them for the bonds.


111
0:8:18,8 --> 0:8:20,58
Once this exchange is complete


112
0:8:20,58 --> 0:8:23,96
the government then takes the ten
billion in federal reserve notes


113
0:8:23,96 --> 0:8:26,44
and deposits it into
an bank account.


114
0:8:26,44 --> 0:8:28,14
And, upon this deposit


115
0:8:28,14 --> 0:8:31,4
the paper notes officially
become legal tender money


116
0:8:31,4 --> 0:8:34,18
adding ten billion to
the US money supply.


117
0:8:34,18 --> 0:8:38,82
And there it is, ten billion
in new money has been created.


118
0:8:38,82 --> 0:8:41,38
Of course, this example
is a generalization.


119
0:8:41,38 --> 0:8:45,53
For, in reality, this transaction
would occur electronically


120
0:8:45,53 --> 0:8:47,39
with no paper used at all.


121
0:8:47,39 --> 0:8:53,4
In fact, only 3% of the US money
supply exists in physical currency.


122
0:8:53,4 --> 0:8:58,6
The other 97 percent essentially
exists in computers alone.


123
0:8:58,6 --> 0:9:2,98
Now, government bonds are by
design instruments of debt.


124
0:9:2,98 --> 0:9:5,13
And when the FED
purchases these bonds


125
0:9:5,13 --> 0:9:7,97
with money essentially
created out of thin air


126
0:9:7,97 --> 0:9:9,7
the government is
actually promising


127
0:9:9,7 --> 0:9:13,2
to pay back that
money to the FED.


128
0:9:13,2 --> 0:9:17,59
In other words, the money
was created out of debt.


129
0:9:17,59 --> 0:9:19,5
This mind numbing paradox


130
0:9:19,5 --> 0:9:23,8
of how money or value can be
created out of debt or a liability


131
0:9:23,8 --> 0:9:27,85
will become more clear as
we further this exercise.


132
0:9:27,85 --> 0:9:29,5
So, the exchange has been made


133
0:9:29,5 --> 0:9:32,91
and now ten billion dollars sits
in a commercial bank account.


134
0:9:32,91 --> 0:9:34,8
Here is where it gets
really interesting.


135
0:9:34,8 --> 0:9:37,68
For, as based on the
fractional reserve practice


136
0:9:37,68 --> 0:9:39,74
that ten billion dollar deposit


137
0:9:39,74 --> 0:9:42,93
instantly becomes part
of the bank's reserves


138
0:9:42,93 --> 0:9:45,73
just as all deposits do.


139
0:9:45,73 --> 0:9:47,69
And, regarding
reserve requirements


140
0:9:47,69 --> 0:9:50,5
as stated in "Modern
Money Mechanics":


141
0:9:50,5 --> 0:9:53,43
"A bank must maintain
legally required reserves


142
0:9:53,43 --> 0:9:56,66
equal to a prescribed
percentage of its deposits".


143
0:9:56,66 --> 0:10:0,549
It then quantifies this by stating:
"Under current regulations


144
0:10:0,549 --> 0:10:0,55
.


145
0:10:0,55 --> 0:10:6,23
the reserve requirement against
most transaction accounts is 10%".


146
0:10:6,23 --> 0:10:8,92
This means that with a ten
billion dollar deposit


147
0:10:8,92 --> 0:10:13,199
10%, or one billion, is held
as the required reserve


148
0:10:13,199 --> 0:10:13,2
.


149
0:10:13,2 --> 0:10:17,2
while the other nine billion is
considered an excessive reserve


150
0:10:17,2 --> 0:10:21,979
and can be used as the
basis for new loans.


151
0:10:21,979 --> 0:10:21,98
.


152
0:10:21,98 --> 0:10:25,15
Now, it is logical to assume,
that this nine billion


153
0:10:25,15 --> 0:10:29,2
is literally coming out of the
existing ten billion dollar deposit.


154
0:10:29,2 --> 0:10:31,48
However, this is
actually not the case.


155
0:10:31,48 --> 0:10:33,93
What really happens, is
that the nine billion


156
0:10:33,93 --> 0:10:36,1
is simply created
out of thin air


157
0:10:36,1 --> 0:10:39,43
on top of the existing 10
billion dollar deposit.


158
0:10:39,43 --> 0:10:42,64
This is how the money
supply is expanded.


159
0:10:42,64 --> 0:10:44,5
As stated in "Modern
Money Mechanics":


160
0:10:44,5 --> 0:10:46,47
"Of course they" -the banks-


161
0:10:46,47 --> 0:10:50,11
"do not really pay out loans for the
money they receive as deposits.


162
0:10:50,11 --> 0:10:53,51
If they did this, no additional
money would be created.


163
0:10:53,51 --> 0:10:55,3
What they do when
they make loans


164
0:10:55,3 --> 0:10:58,525
is to accept promissory
notes" -loan contracts-


165
0:10:58,525 --> 0:11:0,92
"in exchange for
credits" -money-


166
0:11:0,92 --> 0:11:2,94
"to the borrowers'
transaction accounts."


167
0:11:2,94 --> 0:11:6,42
In other words, the nine billion
can be created out of nothing


168
0:11:6,42 --> 0:11:9,21
simply because there is a
demand for such a loan


169
0:11:9,21 --> 0:11:11,66
and that there is a 10
billion dollar deposit


170
0:11:11,66 --> 0:11:15,5
to satisfy the reserve
requirements.


171
0:11:15,5 --> 0:11:18,0
Now, let's assume that
somebody walks into this bank


172
0:11:18,0 --> 0:11:21,35
and borrows the newly available
nine billion dollars.


173
0:11:21,35 --> 0:11:23,7
They will then most
likely take that money


174
0:11:23,7 --> 0:11:28,0
and deposit it into
their own bank account.


175
0:11:28,0 --> 0:11:29,8
The process then repeats.


176
0:11:29,8 --> 0:11:32,71
For that deposit becomes
part of the bank's reserves.


177
0:11:32,71 --> 0:11:38,8
10% is isolated and in turn 90% of
the nine billion, or 8.1 billion


178
0:11:38,8 --> 0:11:41,75
is now available as newly
created money for more loans.


179
0:11:41,75 --> 0:11:45,67
And, of course, that 8.1 can
be loaned out and redeposited


180
0:11:45,67 --> 0:11:48,63
creating an additional
7.2 billion.


181
0:11:48,63 --> 0:11:54,5
To 6.5 billion...
to 5.9 billion... etc.


182
0:11:54,5 --> 0:11:57,16
This deposit money
creation loan cycle


183
0:11:57,16 --> 0:11:59,43
can technically go
on to infinity.


184
0:11:59,43 --> 0:12:3,74
The average mathematical result
is that about 90 billion dollars


185
0:12:3,74 --> 0:12:7,44
can be created on top of
the original 10 billion.


186
0:12:7,44 --> 0:12:9,5
In other words,
for every deposit


187
0:12:9,5 --> 0:12:11,67
that ever occurs in
the banking system


188
0:12:11,67 --> 0:12:16,17
about nine times that amount can
be created out of thin air.


189
0:12:16,17 --> 0:12:19,89
Money-Jitters.
Ask the obliging Bank of America


190
0:12:19,89 --> 0:12:22,58
for a jar of soothing
instant money.


191
0:12:22,58 --> 0:12:28,985
M-O-N-E-Y in the form of a
convenient personal loan.


192
0:12:28,985 --> 0:12:32,0
So, now that we understand
how money is created


193
0:12:32,0 --> 0:12:34,5
by this fractional
reserve banking system


194
0:12:34,5 --> 0:12:38,57
a logical yet illusive
question might come to mind:


195
0:12:38,57 --> 0:12:42,38
What is actually giving this
newly created money value?


196
0:12:42,38 --> 0:12:46,64
The answer: the money
that already exists.


197
0:12:46,64 --> 0:12:51,63
The new money essentially steals value
from the existing money supply.


198
0:12:51,63 --> 0:12:54,65
For the total pool of
money is being increased


199
0:12:54,65 --> 0:12:57,14
irrespective to demand
for goods and services.


200
0:12:57,14 --> 0:13:1,4
And, as supply and demand finds
equilibrium, prices rise


201
0:13:1,4 --> 0:13:5,37
diminishing the purchasing power
of each individual dollar.


202
0:13:5,37 --> 0:13:8,3
This is generally
referred to as inflation.


203
0:13:8,3 --> 0:13:13,2
And inflation is essentially
a hidden tax on the public.


204
0:13:13,2 --> 0:13:15,0
-What is the advice
that you generally get?


205
0:13:15,0 --> 0:13:16,95
And that is, inflate
the currency.


206
0:13:16,95 --> 0:13:18,55
They don't say:
debase the currency.


207
0:13:18,55 --> 0:13:20,15
They don't say:
devalue the currency.


208
0:13:20,15 --> 0:13:22,4
They don't say: cheat the
people who are safe.


209
0:13:22,4 --> 0:13:24,2
They say: lower the
interest rates.


210
0:13:24,2 --> 0:13:27,83
The real deception is when we
distort the value of money.


211
0:13:27,83 --> 0:13:31,8
When we create money out of
thin air, we have no savings.


212
0:13:31,8 --> 0:13:33,35
Yet there's so called "capital".


213
0:13:33,35 --> 0:13:35,81
So, my question
boils down to this:


214
0:13:35,81 --> 0:13:41,0
How in the world can we expect to
solve the problems of inflation


215
0:13:41,0 --> 0:13:45,46
that is the increase in the supply
of money, with more inflation?


216
0:13:45,46 --> 0:13:47,43
-Of course, it can't.


217
0:13:47,43 --> 0:13:50,32
The fractional reserve
system of monetary expansion


218
0:13:50,32 --> 0:13:52,41
is inherently inflationary.


219
0:13:52,41 --> 0:13:54,64
For the act of expanding
the money supply,


220
0:13:54,64 --> 0:13:58,19
without there being a proportional
expansion of goods and services


221
0:13:58,19 --> 0:14:1,66
in the economy, will
always debase a currency.


222
0:14:1,66 --> 0:14:5,53
In fact, a quick glance at the
historical values of the US dollar


223
0:14:5,53 --> 0:14:9,0
versus the money supply,
reflects this point definitively


224
0:14:9,0 --> 0:14:13,52
for the inverse
relationship is obvious.


225
0:14:13,52 --> 0:14:22,43
One dollar in 1913 required
$21.60 in 2007 to match value.


226
0:14:22,43 --> 0:14:25,7
That is a 96% devaluation


227
0:14:25,7 --> 0:14:30,47
since the Federal Reserve
came into existence.


228
0:14:30,47 --> 0:14:34,56
Now, if this reality of inherent
and perpetual inflation


229
0:14:34,56 --> 0:14:38,57
seems absurd and
economically self defeating


230
0:14:38,57 --> 0:14:42,34
hold that thought, for
absurdity is an understatement


231
0:14:42,34 --> 0:14:46,78
in regard to how our financial
system really operates.


232
0:14:46,78 --> 0:14:51,45
For in our financial
system money is debt


233
0:14:51,45 --> 0:14:53,96
and debt is money.


234
0:14:53,96 --> 0:14:59,64
Here is a chart of the US money
supply from 1950 to 2006.


235
0:14:59,64 --> 0:15:3,15
Here is a chart of the US national
debt for the same period.


236
0:15:3,15 --> 0:15:7,34
How interesting it is that the
trends are virtually the same.


237
0:15:7,34 --> 0:15:10,55
For the more money there is,
the more debt there is.


238
0:15:10,55 --> 0:15:13,86
The more debt there is,
the more money there is.


239
0:15:13,86 --> 0:15:17,28
To put it a different way, every
single dollar in your wallet


240
0:15:17,28 --> 0:15:21,13
is owed to somebody by somebody.
For remember:


241
0:15:21,13 --> 0:15:24,78
The only way the money can come
into existence is from loans.


242
0:15:24,78 --> 0:15:28,57
Therefore, if everyone in the country
were able to pay off all debts


243
0:15:28,57 --> 0:15:30,19
including the government


244
0:15:30,19 --> 0:15:34,97
there would not be one
dollar in circulation.


245
0:15:34,97 --> 0:15:37,7
"If there were no debts
in our money system


246
0:15:37,7 --> 0:15:39,99
there wouldn't be any money."


247
0:15:39,99 --> 0:15:43,72
-Marriner Eccles- Governor of the
Federal Reserve September 30th, 1941


248
0:15:43,72 --> 0:15:46,1
-In fact, the last time
in American history


249
0:15:46,1 --> 0:15:50,42
the national debt was
completely paid off was in 1835


250
0:15:50,42 --> 0:15:54,1
after president Andrew Jackson
shut down the central bank


251
0:15:54,1 --> 0:15:56,52
that preceded the
Federal Reserve.


252
0:15:56,52 --> 0:16:0,6
In fact, Jackson's entire political
platform essentially revolved


253
0:16:0,6 --> 0:16:3,52
around his commitment to
shut down the central bank.


254
0:16:3,52 --> 0:16:5,13
Stating at one point:


255
0:16:5,13 --> 0:16:8,38
"The bold efforts the present bank
has made to control the government


256
0:16:8,38 --> 0:16:12,14
are but premonitions of the fate
that awaits the American people


257
0:16:12,14 --> 0:16:15,65
should they be deluded into a
perpetuation of this institution


258
0:16:15,65 --> 0:16:18,44
or the establishment
of another like it."


259
0:16:18,44 --> 0:16:21,0
Unfortunately his message
was short lived,


260
0:16:21,0 --> 0:16:22,88
and the international
bankers succeeded


261
0:16:22,88 --> 0:16:28,18
to install another central bank
in 1913, the Federal Reserve.


262
0:16:28,18 --> 0:16:34,569
And as long as this institution
exists, perpetual debt is guaranteed.


263
0:16:34,569 --> 0:16:34,57
.


264
0:16:34,57 --> 0:16:37,82
Now, so far we have
discussed the reality


265
0:16:37,82 --> 0:16:41,25
that money is created out
of debt through loans.


266
0:16:41,25 --> 0:16:43,39
These loans are based
on a bank's reserves


267
0:16:43,39 --> 0:16:45,85
and reserves are
derived from deposits.


268
0:16:45,85 --> 0:16:48,7
And through this
fractional reserve system


269
0:16:48,7 --> 0:16:52,17
any one deposit can create 9
times its original value.


270
0:16:52,17 --> 0:16:55,12
In turn, debasing the
existing money supply


271
0:16:55,12 --> 0:16:57,55
raising prices in society.


272
0:16:57,55 --> 0:17:0,39
And, since all this money
is created out of debt


273
0:17:0,39 --> 0:17:3,2
and circulated randomly
through commerce


274
0:17:3,2 --> 0:17:6,35
people become detached
from their original debt


275
0:17:6,35 --> 0:17:8,65
and a disequilibrium exists


276
0:17:8,65 --> 0:17:11,29
where people are forced
to compete for labor


277
0:17:11,29 --> 0:17:14,37
in order to pull enough money
out of the money supply


278
0:17:14,37 --> 0:17:18,11
to cover their costs of living.


279
0:17:18,11 --> 0:17:21,5
As dysfunctional and backwards
as all of this might seem


280
0:17:21,5 --> 0:17:25,7
there is still one thing we have
omitted from this equation.


281
0:17:25,7 --> 0:17:28,3
And it is this element
of the structure


282
0:17:28,3 --> 0:17:33,95
which reveals the truly fraudulent
nature of the system itself.


283
0:17:33,95 --> 0:17:38,4
The application of interest.


284
0:17:38,4 --> 0:17:40,76
When the government borrows
money from the FED


285
0:17:40,76 --> 0:17:43,23
or when a person borrows
money from a bank


286
0:17:43,23 --> 0:17:48,4
it almost always has to be paid
back with accrued interest.


287
0:17:48,4 --> 0:17:51,56
In other words, almost every
single dollar that exists


288
0:17:51,56 --> 0:17:55,77
must be eventually returned to a
bank with interest paid as well.


289
0:17:55,77 --> 0:17:59,53
But, if all money is borrowed
from the Central Bank


290
0:17:59,53 --> 0:18:3,32
and is expanded by commercial
banks through loans


291
0:18:3,32 --> 0:18:6,19
only what would be referred
to as the "principal"


292
0:18:6,19 --> 0:18:9,18
is being created in
the money supply.


293
0:18:9,18 --> 0:18:11,21
So then, where is the money


294
0:18:11,21 --> 0:18:14,97
to cover all of the
interest that is charged?


295
0:18:14,97 --> 0:18:16,38
Nowhere.


296
0:18:16,38 --> 0:18:18,47
It doesn't exist.


297
0:18:18,47 --> 0:18:20,85
The ramifications of
this are staggering


298
0:18:20,85 --> 0:18:24,55
for the amount of money owed back
to the banks will always exceed


299
0:18:24,55 --> 0:18:28,6
the amount of money that is
available in circulation.


300
0:18:28,6 --> 0:18:31,41
This is why inflation is a
constant in the economy


301
0:18:31,41 --> 0:18:33,65
for new money is always needed


302
0:18:33,65 --> 0:18:37,54
to help cover the perpetual
deficit built into the system


303
0:18:37,54 --> 0:18:40,49
caused by the need
to pay the interest.


304
0:18:40,49 --> 0:18:43,4
What this also means,
is that mathematically


305
0:18:43,4 --> 0:18:47,13
defaults and bankruptcy are
literally built into this system


306
0:18:47,13 --> 0:18:50,11
and there will always be
poor pockets of society


307
0:18:50,11 --> 0:18:52,3
that get the short
end of the stick.


308
0:18:52,3 --> 0:18:55,8
An analogy would be a
game of musical chairs


309
0:18:55,8 --> 0:18:59,54
for the once music stops,
somebody is left out to dry.


310
0:18:59,54 --> 0:19:1,23
And that's the point.


311
0:19:1,23 --> 0:19:5,65
It invariably transfers true wealth
from the individual to the banks.


312
0:19:5,65 --> 0:19:8,4
For, if you are unable
to pay for your mortgage


313
0:19:8,4 --> 0:19:10,0
they will take your property.


314
0:19:10,0 --> 0:19:12,9
This is particularly
enraging when you realize


315
0:19:12,9 --> 0:19:15,635
that not only is such
a default inevitable


316
0:19:15,635 --> 0:19:19,15
due to the fractional reserve practice,
but also because of the fact


317
0:19:19,15 --> 0:19:22,0
that the money that the
bank loaned to you


318
0:19:22,0 --> 0:19:25,685
didn't even legally exist
in the first place.


319
0:19:25,685 --> 0:19:28,63
In 1969 there was a
Minnesota court case


320
0:19:28,63 --> 0:19:31,4
involving a man
named Jerome Daly


321
0:19:31,4 --> 0:19:34,18
who was challenging the foreclosure
of his home by the bank


322
0:19:34,18 --> 0:19:36,24
which provided the
loan to purchase it.


323
0:19:36,24 --> 0:19:38,92
His argument was that
the mortgage contract


324
0:19:38,92 --> 0:19:41,86
required both parties
-being he and the bank-


325
0:19:41,86 --> 0:19:46,48
each put up a legitimate form
of property for the exchange.


326
0:19:46,48 --> 0:19:49,46
In legal language this
is called consideration:


327
0:19:49,46 --> 0:19:52,2
[ a contract's basis.
a contract is founded on an exchange


328
0:19:52,2 --> 0:19:54,32
of one form of consideration
for another. ]


329
0:19:54,32 --> 0:19:57,57
Mr. Daly explained that
the money was, in fact


330
0:19:57,57 --> 0:20:1,22
not the property of the bank, for
it was created out of nothing


331
0:20:1,22 --> 0:20:3,4
as soon as the loan
agreement was signed.


332
0:20:3,4 --> 0:20:6,9
Remember what "Modern Money
Mechanics" stated about loans?


333
0:20:6,9 --> 0:20:8,85
"What they do, when
they make loans, is to


334
0:20:8,85 --> 0:20:11,977
accept promissory notes
in exchange for credits.


335
0:20:11,977 --> 0:20:14,513
Reserves are unchanged by
the loan transactions.


336
0:20:14,513 --> 0:20:17,672
But, deposit credits
constitute new additions


337
0:20:17,672 --> 0:20:20,54
to the total deposits
of the banking system."


338
0:20:20,54 --> 0:20:24,1
In other words, the money doesn't
come out of their existing assets.


339
0:20:24,1 --> 0:20:27,626
The bank is simply inventing it,
putting up nothing of its own


340
0:20:27,626 --> 0:20:30,996
except for a theoretical
liability on paper.


341
0:20:30,996 --> 0:20:32,93
As the court case progressed


342
0:20:32,93 --> 0:20:35,74
the bank's president Mr.
Morgan took the stand


343
0:20:35,74 --> 0:20:39,18
and in the judge's personal
memorandum, he recalled that


344
0:20:39,18 --> 0:20:41,54
the Plaintiff - bank's
president - admitted that


345
0:20:41,54 --> 0:20:44,4
in combination with the
Federal Reserve Bank


346
0:20:44,4 --> 0:20:48,981
did create the money and credit upon
its books by book-keeping entry.


347
0:20:48,981 --> 0:20:52,5
The money and credit first came into
existence when they created it.


348
0:20:52,5 --> 0:20:53,7
Mr. Morgan admitted that


349
0:20:53,7 --> 0:20:58,59
no US Law or Statute existed which
gave him the right to do this.


350
0:20:58,59 --> 0:21:3,15
A lawful consideration must exist and
be tendered to support the note.


351
0:21:3,15 --> 0:21:6,632
The Jury found that there was no
lawful consideration and I agree.


352
0:21:6,632 --> 0:21:8,3
He also poetically added:


353
0:21:8,3 --> 0:21:12,4
"Only God can create something
of value out of nothing".


354
0:21:12,4 --> 0:21:14,18
And, upon this revelation


355
0:21:14,18 --> 0:21:17,1
the court rejected the
bank's claim for foreclosure


356
0:21:17,1 --> 0:21:19,978
and Daly kept his home.


357
0:21:19,978 --> 0:21:22,981
The implications of this
court decision are immense.


358
0:21:22,981 --> 0:21:25,64
For every time you
borrow money from a bank


359
0:21:25,64 --> 0:21:29,0
whether it is a mortgage
loan or a credit card charge


360
0:21:29,0 --> 0:21:31,955
the money given to you
is not only counterfeit


361
0:21:31,955 --> 0:21:34,993
it is an illegitimate
form of consideration


362
0:21:34,993 --> 0:21:37,789
and hence, voids the
contract to repay.


363
0:21:37,789 --> 0:21:41,967
For the bank never had the money
as property to begin with.


364
0:21:41,967 --> 0:21:45,971
Unfortunately such legal realizations
are suppressed and ignored.


365
0:21:45,971 --> 0:21:51,2
And the game of perpetual wealth
transfer and perpetual debt continues.


366
0:21:51,2 --> 0:21:53,979
And this brings us to
the ultimate question:


367
0:21:53,979 --> 0:21:56,5
Why?


368
0:21:56,5 --> 0:21:58,36
During the American Civil War


369
0:21:58,36 --> 0:22:1,59
President Lincoln bypassed
the high interest loans


370
0:22:1,59 --> 0:22:3,881
offered by the European banks


371
0:22:3,881 --> 0:22:7,14
and decided to do what the
founding fathers advocated


372
0:22:7,14 --> 0:22:11,997
which was to create an independent
and inherently debt-free currency.


373
0:22:11,997 --> 0:22:15,967
It was called "The Greenback".


374
0:22:15,967 --> 0:22:20,5
Shortly after this measure was taken,
an internal document circulated


375
0:22:20,5 --> 0:22:24,5
between private British and
American banking interests, stated:


376
0:22:24,5 --> 0:22:26,5
"...slavery is but
the owning of labor


377
0:22:26,5 --> 0:22:29,5
and carries with it
the care of laborers.


378
0:22:29,5 --> 0:22:31,288
While the European plan


379
0:22:31,288 --> 0:22:35,5
is that capital shall control
labor by controlling wages.


380
0:22:35,5 --> 0:22:38,25
This can be done by
controlling the money.


381
0:22:38,25 --> 0:22:43,662
It will not do to allow the Greenback...
as we cannot control that."


382
0:22:43,662 --> 0:22:45,76
The fractional reserve policy


383
0:22:45,76 --> 0:22:49,62
perpetrated by the Federal Reserve
which has spread in practice


384
0:22:49,62 --> 0:22:51,97
to the great majority
of banks in the world


385
0:22:51,97 --> 0:22:59,511
is, in fact, a system
of modern slavery.


386
0:22:59,511 --> 0:23:3,415
Think about it, money
is created out of debt.


387
0:23:3,415 --> 0:23:6,5
And what the people do
when they are in debt?


388
0:23:6,5 --> 0:23:9,5
They submit to employment
to pay it off.


389
0:23:9,5 --> 0:23:12,524
But if money only can only
be created out of loans


390
0:23:12,524 --> 0:23:15,994
how can society
ever be debt free?


391
0:23:15,994 --> 0:23:18,997
It can't and that's the point.


392
0:23:18,997 --> 0:23:21,84
And it is the fear
of losing assets


393
0:23:21,84 --> 0:23:23,4
coupled with the
struggle to keep up


394
0:23:23,4 --> 0:23:27,8
with the perpetual debt and
inflation inherent in the system


395
0:23:27,8 --> 0:23:31,977
compounded by the inescapable scarcity
within the money supply itself


396
0:23:31,977 --> 0:23:36,3
created by the interest
that can never be repaid


397
0:23:36,3 --> 0:23:39,985
that keeps the
wage-slave in line.


398
0:23:39,985 --> 0:23:43,15
Running on a hamster wheel,
with millions of others


399
0:23:43,15 --> 0:23:45,991
in effect powering an empire


400
0:23:45,991 --> 0:23:50,996
that truly benefits only the
elite at the top of the pyramid.


401
0:23:50,996 --> 0:23:55,966
For, at the end of the day, who
are you really working for?


402
0:23:55,966 --> 0:23:55,967
.


403
0:23:55,967 --> 0:23:57,669
The banks.


404
0:23:57,669 --> 0:24:1,5
Money is created in a bank and
invariably ends up in a bank.


405
0:24:1,5 --> 0:24:3,49
They are the true masters


406
0:24:3,49 --> 0:24:8,5
along with the corporations
and governments they support.


407
0:24:8,5 --> 0:24:12,55
Physical slavery requires
people to be housed and fed.


408
0:24:12,55 --> 0:24:18,256
Economic slavery requires people
to feed and house themselves.


409
0:24:18,256 --> 0:24:20,767
It is one of the
most ingenious scams


410
0:24:20,767 --> 0:24:22,9
for social manipulation
ever created.


411
0:24:22,9 --> 0:24:24,5
And at its core


412
0:24:24,5 --> 0:24:27,9
it is an invisible war
against the population.


413
0:24:27,9 --> 0:24:32,32
Debt is the weapon used to
conquer and enslave societies


414
0:24:32,32 --> 0:24:36,975
and interest is its
prime ammunition.


415
0:24:36,975 --> 0:24:41,2
And, as the majority walks
around oblivious to this reality


416
0:24:41,2 --> 0:24:44,76
the banks in collusion with
governments and corporations


417
0:24:44,76 --> 0:24:49,454
continue to perfect and expand
their tactics of economic warfare


418
0:24:49,454 --> 0:24:52,71
spawning new bases,
such as the World Bank


419
0:24:52,71 --> 0:24:55,2
and International
Monetary Fund [IMF]


420
0:24:55,2 --> 0:24:58,396
while also inventing a
new type of soldier:


421
0:24:58,396 --> 0:25:6,14
The birth of the
Economic Hit Man.


422
0:25:6,14 --> 0:25:9,5
"There are two ways to conquer
and enslave a nation.


423
0:25:9,5 --> 0:25:14,0
One is by sword. The other is by debt."
- John Adams - 1735-1826


424
0:25:14,0 --> 0:25:17,515
-We economic hit men, really have been
the ones responsible for creating


425
0:25:17,515 --> 0:25:22,5
this first truly global empire
and we work many different ways.


426
0:25:22,5 --> 0:25:26,94
John Perkins Former Chief Economist for Chas. T.
Main Inc. Author: Confessions of an Economic Hitman


427
0:25:26,94 --> 0:25:29,29
But perhaps the most
common is that we will


428
0:25:29,29 --> 0:25:34,51
identify a country that has resources
our corporations covet, like oil


429
0:25:34,51 --> 0:25:37,39
and then, arrange a huge
loan to that country


430
0:25:37,39 --> 0:25:40,3
from the World Bank or one
of its sister organizations.


431
0:25:40,3 --> 0:25:42,24
But the money never actually
goes to the country.


432
0:25:42,24 --> 0:25:44,202
Instead it goes to
our big corporations


433
0:25:44,202 --> 0:25:46,57
to built infrastructure
projects in that country.


434
0:25:46,57 --> 0:25:49,0
Power plants, industrial
parks, ports.


435
0:25:49,0 --> 0:25:52,0
Things that benefit a few
rich people in that country


436
0:25:52,0 --> 0:25:53,89
in addition to our corporations


437
0:25:53,89 --> 0:25:56,22
but really don't help the
majority of the people at all.


438
0:25:56,22 --> 0:26:0,87
However, those people, the whole
country is left holding a huge debt.


439
0:26:0,87 --> 0:26:3,76
It's such a big debt they can't repay
it and that's part of the plan


440
0:26:3,76 --> 0:26:5,88
that they can't repay it.
And so, at some point


441
0:26:5,88 --> 0:26:8,62
we economic hit men, go back
to them and say, "Listen,


442
0:26:8,62 --> 0:26:12,27
you owe us a lot of money.
You can't pay your debt. So, sell your oil


443
0:26:12,27 --> 0:26:14,29
real cheap to our oil companies


444
0:26:14,29 --> 0:26:17,14
allow us to build a military
base in your country", or


445
0:26:17,14 --> 0:26:21,34
"send troops in support of ours to
someplace in the world like Iraq"


446
0:26:21,34 --> 0:26:25,32
or "vote with us in the next
UN vote", to have their


447
0:26:25,32 --> 0:26:27,49
electric utility
company privatized and


448
0:26:27,49 --> 0:26:29,59
their water and sewage
system privatized


449
0:26:29,59 --> 0:26:33,83
and sold to US corporations or
other multinational corporations.


450
0:26:33,83 --> 0:26:35,716
So there is a whole
mushrooming thing and


451
0:26:35,716 --> 0:26:38,87
it's so typical of the way the
IMF and the World Bank work.


452
0:26:38,87 --> 0:26:42,845
They put a country in debt and it's
such a big debt it can't pay it


453
0:26:42,845 --> 0:26:47,46
and then you offer to refinance that
debt and pay even more interest


454
0:26:47,46 --> 0:26:51,4
and you demand this quid pro quo


455
0:26:51,4 --> 0:26:54,25
which you call a "conditionality"
or "good governance"


456
0:26:54,25 --> 0:26:57,73
which means basically that they've
got to sell off their resources


457
0:26:57,73 --> 0:27:1,92
including many of their social
services, their utility companies,


458
0:27:1,92 --> 0:27:5,54
their school systems sometimes,
their penal systems


459
0:27:5,54 --> 0:27:9,15
their insurance systems,
to foreign corporations.


460
0:27:9,15 --> 0:27:14,0
So it's a double - triple
- quadruple whammy!


461
0:27:14,0 --> 0:27:16,0
IRAN; 1953


462
0:27:16,0 --> 0:27:20,33
The precedent for economic hit men
really began back in the early 50's


463
0:27:20,33 --> 0:27:24,14
when the democratically elected
Mossadegh who was elected in Iran.


464
0:27:24,14 --> 0:27:27,23
He was considered to be the hope
for democracy in the middle east


465
0:27:27,23 --> 0:27:30,4
and around the world. He was in
Time-Magazine's "Man of the year". But...


466
0:27:30,4 --> 0:27:33,26
one of the things that he ran
on and began to implement was


467
0:27:33,26 --> 0:27:37,36
the idea that foreign oil companies
needed to pay the Iranian people


468
0:27:37,36 --> 0:27:39,7
a lot more for the oil that
they were taking out of Iran


469
0:27:39,7 --> 0:27:44,5
and the Iranian people should benefit
from their own oil. Strange policy.


470
0:27:44,5 --> 0:27:46,9
We didn't like that of course.
But...


471
0:27:46,9 --> 0:27:48,91
we were afraid to do what
we normally were doing


472
0:27:48,91 --> 0:27:53,46
which was to send in the military.
Instead we sent in one CIA agent


473
0:27:53,46 --> 0:27:58,39
Kermit Roosevelt, Teddy
Roosevelt's relative.


474
0:27:58,39 --> 0:28:0,4
And Kermit went in with a
few million dollars and


475
0:28:0,4 --> 0:28:4,17
was very, very effective and efficient
and in a short amount of time


476
0:28:4,17 --> 0:28:7,74
he managed to get
Mossadegh overthrown


477
0:28:7,74 --> 0:28:10,32
and brought in the shah
of Iran to replace him


478
0:28:10,32 --> 0:28:14,824
who always was favorable to oil.
And it was extremely effective.


479
0:28:14,824 --> 0:28:18,0
[ Revolt in Iran ]


480
0:28:18,0 --> 0:28:19,82
"Mobs overthrow Tehran.


481
0:28:19,82 --> 0:28:23,3
Army officers shout that Mossadegh
has surrendered and his regime as


482
0:28:23,3 --> 0:28:27,4
virtual dictator of Iran is ended.
Pictures of the Shah are paraded


483
0:28:27,4 --> 0:28:34,35
through the streets as sentiment reverses.
The Shah is welcomed home."


484
0:28:34,35 --> 0:28:37,1
So back here in the United
States, in Washington


485
0:28:37,1 --> 0:28:40,93
people looked around and said:
"Wow, that was easy and cheap".


486
0:28:40,93 --> 0:28:44,229
So this established
a whole new way


487
0:28:44,229 --> 0:28:47,33
of manipulating countries,
of creating empire.


488
0:28:47,33 --> 0:28:49,593
The only problem with
Roosevelt was that he was a


489
0:28:49,593 --> 0:28:53,57
card carrying CIA agent.
And if he'd been caught


490
0:28:53,57 --> 0:28:56,19
the ramifications could
have been pretty serious.


491
0:28:56,19 --> 0:28:58,527
So very quickly, at that point,
the decision was made to


492
0:28:58,527 --> 0:29:2,12
use private consultants to
channel the money through the


493
0:29:2,12 --> 0:29:5,57
World Bank or the IMF or one
of the other such agencies


494
0:29:5,57 --> 0:29:9,0
to bring in people like me, who
worked for private companies.


495
0:29:9,0 --> 0:29:11,171
So that if we got caught


496
0:29:11,171 --> 0:29:15,37
there would be no
governmental ramifications.


497
0:29:15,37 --> 0:29:22,0
GUATEMALA 1954


498
0:29:22,0 --> 0:29:24,467
When Árbenz became
president of Guatemala


499
0:29:24,467 --> 0:29:26,87
the country was very
much under the thumbs of


500
0:29:26,87 --> 0:29:30,1
United Fruit company, the big
international corporations


501
0:29:30,1 --> 0:29:32,64
and Árbenz ran on this
ticket that said: "You know


502
0:29:32,64 --> 0:29:35,13
we want to give the land
back to the people".


503
0:29:35,13 --> 0:29:39,16
And once he took power, he was
implementing policies that would


504
0:29:39,16 --> 0:29:42,46
would do exactly that, give the
land rights back to the people.


505
0:29:42,46 --> 0:29:44,43
United Fruit didn't
like that very much.


506
0:29:44,43 --> 0:29:48,53
And so, they hired a public relations
firm, launched a huge campaign


507
0:29:48,53 --> 0:29:51,38
in the United States to convince
the United States people


508
0:29:51,38 --> 0:29:53,98
the citizens of the United States,
the press of the United States and


509
0:29:53,98 --> 0:29:57,67
the Congress of the United States,
that Árbenz was a soviet puppet


510
0:29:57,67 --> 0:29:59,993
and that if we allowed
him to stay in power


511
0:29:59,993 --> 0:30:2,89
the Soviets would have a
foothold in this hemisphere.


512
0:30:2,89 --> 0:30:6,49
And that, at that point in time, was
a huge fear on everybody's mind


513
0:30:6,49 --> 0:30:8,905
of the red terror, the
communist terror.


514
0:30:8,905 --> 0:30:13,82
And so, to make a long story short,
out of this public relations campaign


515
0:30:13,82 --> 0:30:17,85
came a commitment on the part of the CIA
and the military to take this man out.


516
0:30:17,85 --> 0:30:22,145
And in fact, we did. We sent in
planes, we sent in soldiers, we sent


517
0:30:22,145 --> 0:30:25,85
in jackals, we sent everything in to take him out.
And did take him out.


518
0:30:25,85 --> 0:30:28,346
And as soon as he was
removed from office


519
0:30:28,346 --> 0:30:32,6
the new guy that took over after him
basically reinstated everything to


520
0:30:32,6 --> 0:30:40,51
the big international corporations,
including United Fruit.


521
0:30:40,51 --> 0:30:44,6
[Ecuador 1981] Ecuador, for many, many
years had been ruled by pro-US dictators


522
0:30:44,6 --> 0:30:48,8
often relatively brutal.
Then it was decided they were gonna have


523
0:30:48,8 --> 0:30:53,89
a truly democratic election.
Jaime Roldós ran for office and his main goal


524
0:30:53,89 --> 0:30:57,62
he said, as president would be
to make sure that Ecuador's


525
0:30:57,62 --> 0:31:2,85
resources were used to help the people.
And he won. Overwhelming.


526
0:31:2,85 --> 0:31:5,75
By more votes than anybody had
ever won anything in Ecuador.


527
0:31:5,75 --> 0:31:8,3
And he began to implement
these policies.


528
0:31:8,3 --> 0:31:12,35
To make sure that the profits
from oil went to help the people.


529
0:31:12,35 --> 0:31:14,87
Well, we didn't like that
in the United States.


530
0:31:14,87 --> 0:31:19,65
I was sent down as one of several
economic hit men to change Roldós.


531
0:31:19,65 --> 0:31:23,61
To corrupt him. To bring him around.
To let him know, you know.


532
0:31:23,61 --> 0:31:27,12
"Ok, you know, you can get very rich,
you and your family, if you play


533
0:31:27,12 --> 0:31:31,35
our game. But if you continue to try
to keep these policies you've promised


534
0:31:31,35 --> 0:31:36,35
you're gonna go.
" He wouldn't listen.


535
0:31:36,35 --> 0:31:39,9
He was assassinated.


536
0:31:39,9 --> 0:31:43,89
As soon as the plane crashed, the
whole area was cordoned off.


537
0:31:43,89 --> 0:31:47,16
The only people allowed in were
US military from a nearby base


538
0:31:47,16 --> 0:31:49,11
and some of the
Ecuadorian military.


539
0:31:49,11 --> 0:31:51,7
When an investigation
was launched


540
0:31:51,7 --> 0:31:54,38
two of the key witnesses
died in car accidents


541
0:31:54,38 --> 0:31:56,9
before they had a
chance to testify.


542
0:31:56,9 --> 0:31:59,95
A lot of very, very strange
things that went on around


543
0:31:59,95 --> 0:32:2,16
the assassination
of Jaime Roldós.


544
0:32:2,16 --> 0:32:6,9
I, like most people who've
really looked at this case


545
0:32:6,9 --> 0:32:8,865
have absolutely no doubt that
it was an assassination.


546
0:32:8,865 --> 0:32:11,76
And, of course, in my position
as an economic hit man


547
0:32:11,76 --> 0:32:13,82
I was always expecting
something to happen to Jaime


548
0:32:13,82 --> 0:32:16,4
whether it'd be a coup or assassination,
I wasn't sure, but that


549
0:32:16,4 --> 0:32:19,95
he would be taken down, because he
was not being corrupted, he would


550
0:32:19,95 --> 0:32:24,921
not allow himself to be corrupted
the way we wanted to corrupt him.


551
0:32:24,921 --> 0:32:28,8
PANAMA 1981


552
0:32:28,8 --> 0:32:30,17
Omar Torrijos,
president of Panama


553
0:32:30,17 --> 0:32:33,2
was, you know, one of my favorite people.
I really, really liked him.


554
0:32:33,2 --> 0:32:36,94
He was very charismatic. He was a guy
who really wanted to help his country.


555
0:32:36,94 --> 0:32:40,865
And when I tried to bribe him or
corrupt him, he said: "Look, John"


556
0:32:40,865 --> 0:32:43,37
- he called me Juanito
- He said: "Look Juanito,


557
0:32:43,37 --> 0:32:48,85
I don't need the money.
What I really need is for my country


558
0:32:48,85 --> 0:32:52,89
to be treated fairly.
I need for the US to repay the


559
0:32:52,89 --> 0:32:55,83
debts that you owe my people for all
the destruction you've done here.


560
0:32:55,83 --> 0:33:0,0
I need to be in a position where I can
help other Latin American countries


561
0:33:0,0 --> 0:33:2,94
win their independence
and be free of this


562
0:33:2,94 --> 0:33:5,92
of this terrible
presence from the North.


563
0:33:5,92 --> 0:33:7,8
You people are
exploiting us so badly.


564
0:33:7,8 --> 0:33:12,8
I need to have the Panama Canal back
in the hands of the Panamanian people.


565
0:33:12,8 --> 0:33:13,7
That's what I want.


566
0:33:13,7 --> 0:33:18,43
And so, leave me alone, don't, you
know, don't try to bribe me".


567
0:33:18,43 --> 0:33:24,385
It was 1981 and, in May, Jaime
Roldos was assassinated.


568
0:33:24,385 --> 0:33:26,94
And Omar was very aware of this.


569
0:33:26,94 --> 0:33:29,36
Torrijos got his family
together and he said:


570
0:33:29,36 --> 0:33:32,53
"I'm probably next, but it's OK


571
0:33:32,53 --> 0:33:36,6
because I've done what
I came here to do


572
0:33:36,6 --> 0:33:38,34
I've renegotiated the Canal.


573
0:33:38,34 --> 0:33:41,1
The Canal will now be in our hands.
" He'd just finished negotiating


574
0:33:41,1 --> 0:33:46,3
the treaty with Jimmy Carter.


575
0:33:46,3 --> 0:33:49,19
In June of that same year,
just a couple of months later


576
0:33:49,19 --> 0:33:52,69
he also went down in
an airplane crash


577
0:33:52,69 --> 0:33:57,15
which, there's no question, was
executed by CIA sponsored jackals.


578
0:33:57,15 --> 0:33:58,53
A tremendous amount
of evidence that


579
0:33:58,53 --> 0:34:3,22
one of Torijos' security guards
handed him, at the last moment


580
0:34:3,22 --> 0:34:5,32
as he was getting on the
plane, a tape recorder.


581
0:34:5,32 --> 0:34:13,5
A small tape recorder
that contained a bomb.


582
0:34:13,5 --> 0:34:15,0
VENEZUELA 2002


583
0:34:15,0 --> 0:34:17,13
It is interesting to me how this


584
0:34:17,13 --> 0:34:20,8
system has continued
pretty much the same way


585
0:34:20,8 --> 0:34:22,4
for years and years and years,
except the economic hit men


586
0:34:22,4 --> 0:34:24,35
have got better and
better and better.


587
0:34:24,35 --> 0:34:29,23
Then we come up with, very recently,
what happened in Venezuela.


588
0:34:29,23 --> 0:34:32,41
In 1998, Hugo Chavez
gets elected president


589
0:34:32,41 --> 0:34:34,7
following a long
line of presidents


590
0:34:34,7 --> 0:34:37,86
who'd been very corrupt and
basically destroyed the economy


591
0:34:37,86 --> 0:34:41,8
of the country.
And Chavez was elected amidst all that.


592
0:34:41,8 --> 0:34:44,5
Chavez stood up to
the United States


593
0:34:44,5 --> 0:34:48,92
and he's done it primarily
demanding that Venezuelan oil


594
0:34:48,92 --> 0:34:52,5
be used to help the
Venezuelan people.


595
0:34:52,5 --> 0:34:55,45
Well, we didn't like that
in the United States.


596
0:34:55,45 --> 0:34:57,5
So in 2002


597
0:34:57,5 --> 0:35:0,82
a coup was staged, which
there's no question in my mind


598
0:35:0,82 --> 0:35:9,3
and most other people's minds,
that the CIA was behind that coup.


599
0:35:9,3 --> 0:35:11,5
The way that that
coup was fomented


600
0:35:11,5 --> 0:35:14,8
was very reflective of what Kermit
Roosevelt had done in Iran.


601
0:35:14,8 --> 0:35:17,27
Of paying people to go
out onto the streets


602
0:35:17,27 --> 0:35:21,69
to riot, to protest, to say
that Chavez was very unpopular.


603
0:35:21,69 --> 0:35:25,15
You know, if you can get a few
thousand people to do that


604
0:35:25,15 --> 0:35:29,18
television can make it look
like it's the whole country


605
0:35:29,18 --> 0:35:31,87
and things start to mushroom.


606
0:35:31,87 --> 0:35:35,56
Except in the case of
Chavez, he was smart enough


607
0:35:35,56 --> 0:35:41,209
and the people were so strongly
behind him, that they overcame it


608
0:35:41,209 --> 0:35:41,21
.


609
0:35:41,21 --> 0:35:47,5
which was a phenomenal moment in
the history of Latin America.


610
0:35:47,5 --> 0:35:49,82
IRAQ 2003


611
0:35:49,82 --> 0:35:52,2
Iraq, actually, is
a perfect example


612
0:35:52,2 --> 0:35:54,45
of the way the whole
system works.


613
0:35:54,45 --> 0:35:57,13
So we, economic hit men, are
the first line of defense.


614
0:35:57,13 --> 0:35:59,89
We go in, we try to
corrupt the governments


615
0:35:59,89 --> 0:36:2,15
and get them to accept
these huge loans


616
0:36:2,15 --> 0:36:5,16
which we then use as leverage
to basically own them.


617
0:36:5,16 --> 0:36:9,96
If we fail, as I failed in
Panama with Omar Torrijos


618
0:36:9,96 --> 0:36:14,4
and Ecuador with Jaime Roldós,
men who refused to be corrupted


619
0:36:14,4 --> 0:36:16,68
then the second line of defense
is we send in the jackals.


620
0:36:16,68 --> 0:36:19,87
And the jackals either overthrow
governments or they assassinate.


621
0:36:19,87 --> 0:36:22,69
And, once that happens and
a new government comes in


622
0:36:22,69 --> 0:36:24,83
boy it's gonna tow
the line because


623
0:36:24,83 --> 0:36:27,74
that new president knows what
will happen if he doesn't.


624
0:36:27,74 --> 0:36:31,24
In the case of Iraq, both
of those things failed.


625
0:36:31,24 --> 0:36:34,36
The economic hit men were not able
to get through to Saddam Hussein.


626
0:36:34,36 --> 0:36:37,0
We tried very hard, we tried
to get him to accept a deal


627
0:36:37,0 --> 0:36:40,75
very similar to what the House of
Saud had accepted in Saudi Arabia


628
0:36:40,75 --> 0:36:42,36
but he wouldn't accept it.


629
0:36:42,36 --> 0:36:44,5
And so the jackals went
in to take him out.


630
0:36:44,5 --> 0:36:47,34
They couldn't do it.
His security was very good.


631
0:36:47,34 --> 0:36:50,25
After all, he at one time,
worked for the CIA.


632
0:36:50,25 --> 0:36:54,79
He'd been hired to assassinate a
former president of Iraq and failed


633
0:36:54,79 --> 0:36:56,85
but he knew the system.


634
0:36:56,85 --> 0:37:2,339
So, in '91, we send in the troops
and we take out the Iraqi military.


635
0:37:2,339 --> 0:37:2,34
.


636
0:37:2,34 --> 0:37:4,11
So, we assume at that point


637
0:37:4,11 --> 0:37:6,49
that Saddam Hussein
is gonna come around.


638
0:37:6,49 --> 0:37:9,73
We could have taken him out,
of course at that time


639
0:37:9,73 --> 0:37:12,8
but we didn't want to.
He's the kind of strong man we like.


640
0:37:12,8 --> 0:37:15,8
He controls his people.
We thought he could control the Kurds


641
0:37:15,8 --> 0:37:18,78
and keep the Iranians in their
border and keep pumping oil for us.


642
0:37:18,78 --> 0:37:22,7
And that once we took out his
military, now he's gonna come around.


643
0:37:22,7 --> 0:37:26,299
So the economic hit men go back
in in the 90's, without success.


644
0:37:26,299 --> 0:37:26,3
.


645
0:37:26,3 --> 0:37:29,4
If they'd had success he'd
still be running the country.


646
0:37:29,4 --> 0:37:32,7
We'd be selling him all
the fighter jets he wants


647
0:37:32,7 --> 0:37:35,7
and everything else he wants, but they
couldn't; they didn't have success.


648
0:37:35,7 --> 0:37:37,68
The jackals couldn't
take him out again


649
0:37:37,68 --> 0:37:39,7
so we sent the
military in once again


650
0:37:39,7 --> 0:37:42,3
and this time we did the
complete job and took him out.


651
0:37:42,3 --> 0:37:43,95
And in the process,
created for ourselves


652
0:37:43,95 --> 0:37:47,83
some very, very lucrative
construction deals


653
0:37:47,83 --> 0:37:50,58
to reconstruct the country that
we'd essentially destroyed.


654
0:37:50,58 --> 0:37:52,18
Which is a pretty good deal


655
0:37:52,18 --> 0:37:55,34
if you own construction
companies, big ones.


656
0:37:55,34 --> 0:37:58,95
So, Iraq shows the three stages.


657
0:37:58,95 --> 0:38:1,3
The economic hit
men failed there.


658
0:38:1,3 --> 0:38:8,82
The jackals failed there.
And as a final measure the military goes in.


659
0:38:8,82 --> 0:38:11,43
And in that way we've
really created an empire


660
0:38:11,43 --> 0:38:14,85
but we've done it very, very subtly.
It's clandestine.


661
0:38:14,85 --> 0:38:17,52
All empires of the past
were built on the military


662
0:38:17,52 --> 0:38:19,32
and everybody knew they
were building them.


663
0:38:19,32 --> 0:38:21,43
The British knew they were
building them, the French


664
0:38:21,43 --> 0:38:24,44
the Germans, the
Romans, the Greeks


665
0:38:24,44 --> 0:38:26,69
and they were proud of it, and
they always had some excuse


666
0:38:26,69 --> 0:38:30,37
like spreading civilization,
spreading some religion


667
0:38:30,37 --> 0:38:33,25
something like that, but they
knew they were doing it.


668
0:38:33,25 --> 0:38:34,85
We don't.


669
0:38:34,85 --> 0:38:38,11
The majority of the people in
the United States have no idea


670
0:38:38,11 --> 0:38:41,87
that we're living off the benefits
of the clandestine empire.


671
0:38:41,87 --> 0:38:48,18
That today there is more slavery
in the world than ever before.


672
0:38:48,18 --> 0:38:49,8
Then you have to ask yourself;


673
0:38:49,8 --> 0:38:52,39
well, if it's an empire,
then who is the emperor?


674
0:38:52,39 --> 0:38:56,18
Obviously our Presidents of the
United States are not emperors.


675
0:38:56,18 --> 0:38:58,15
An emperor is someone
who is not elected


676
0:38:58,15 --> 0:39:0,17
doesn't serve a limited term


677
0:39:0,17 --> 0:39:2,32
and doesn't report to
anyone, essentially.


678
0:39:2,32 --> 0:39:6,16
So you can't classify our
presidents that way.


679
0:39:6,16 --> 0:39:9,25
But we do have what I consider to
be the equivalent of the emperor


680
0:39:9,25 --> 0:39:12,55
and it's what I call
the corporatocracy.


681
0:39:12,55 --> 0:39:15,95
The corporatocracy is
this group of individuals


682
0:39:15,95 --> 0:39:17,45
who run our biggest
corporations.


683
0:39:17,45 --> 0:39:21,57
And they really act as the
emperor of this empire.


684
0:39:21,57 --> 0:39:24,5
They control our media


685
0:39:24,5 --> 0:39:26,69
either through direct
ownership or advertising.


686
0:39:26,69 --> 0:39:29,88
They control most
of our politicians


687
0:39:29,88 --> 0:39:31,65
because they finance
their campaigns


688
0:39:31,65 --> 0:39:34,599
either through the corporations
or through personal contributions


689
0:39:34,599 --> 0:39:34,6
.


690
0:39:34,6 --> 0:39:36,33
that come out of
the corporations.


691
0:39:36,33 --> 0:39:39,149
They're not elected, then
don't serve a limited term


692
0:39:39,149 --> 0:39:39,15
.


693
0:39:39,15 --> 0:39:40,96
they don't report to anybody


694
0:39:40,96 --> 0:39:43,72
and at the very top
of the corporatocracy


695
0:39:43,72 --> 0:39:45,5
you really can't tell
whether the person


696
0:39:45,5 --> 0:39:47,6
is working for a private
corporation or the government


697
0:39:47,6 --> 0:39:49,7
because they're always
moving back and forth.


698
0:39:49,7 --> 0:39:52,24
So, you know, you've got
a guy who one moment


699
0:39:52,24 --> 0:39:56,19
is the president of a big
construction company like Halliburton


700
0:39:56,19 --> 0:39:58,65
and the next moment he's Vice
President of the United States


701
0:39:58,65 --> 0:40:1,37
or the President who was in the oil business.
And this is true


702
0:40:1,37 --> 0:40:3,699
whether you get Democrats or
Republicans in the office.


703
0:40:3,699 --> 0:40:3,7
.


704
0:40:3,7 --> 0:40:7,671
You have this moving back and
forth through a revolving door.


705
0:40:7,671 --> 0:40:12,95
And in a way, our government
is invisible a lot of the time


706
0:40:12,95 --> 0:40:15,746
and its' policies are carried
out by our corporations


707
0:40:15,746 --> 0:40:18,56
on one level or another.
And then again


708
0:40:18,56 --> 0:40:21,62
the policies of the
government are basically


709
0:40:21,62 --> 0:40:25,339
forged by the corporatocracy, and
then presented to the government


710
0:40:25,339 --> 0:40:25,389
.


711
0:40:25,389 --> 0:40:28,8
and they become government policy.
So, there's an incredibly


712
0:40:28,8 --> 0:40:30,12
cozy relationship.


713
0:40:30,12 --> 0:40:33,2
This isn't a conspiracy theory type of thing.
These people don't have to


714
0:40:33,2 --> 0:40:36,0
get together and
plot to do things.


715
0:40:36,0 --> 0:40:36,14
.


716
0:40:36,14 --> 0:40:39,67
They all basically work under
one primary assumption


717
0:40:39,67 --> 0:40:42,666
and that is that they
must maximize profits


718
0:40:42,666 --> 0:40:42,71
.


719
0:40:42,71 --> 0:40:50,981
regardless of the social
and environmental costs.


720
0:40:50,981 --> 0:40:54,552
-This process of manipulation
by the corporatocracy


721
0:40:54,552 --> 0:40:58,989
through the use of debt, bribery
and political overthrow is called


722
0:40:58,989 --> 0:41:0,991
Globalization


723
0:41:0,991 --> 0:41:4,78
Just as the Federal Reserve keeps
the American public in a position


724
0:41:4,78 --> 0:41:9,5
of indentured servitude though
perpetual debt, inflation and interest


725
0:41:9,5 --> 0:41:13,838
the World Bank and IMF serve
this role on a global scale.


726
0:41:13,838 --> 0:41:15,973
The basic scam is simple.


727
0:41:15,973 --> 0:41:18,876
Put a country in debt either
by its own indiscretion


728
0:41:18,876 --> 0:41:21,6
or through corrupting the
leader of that country


729
0:41:21,6 --> 0:41:26,3
then impose "conditionalities" or
"structural adjustment policies"


730
0:41:26,3 --> 0:41:29,778
often consisting
of the following:


731
0:41:29,778 --> 0:41:31,52
Currency devaluation.


732
0:41:31,52 --> 0:41:35,426
When the value of a currency drops,
so does everything valued in it.


733
0:41:35,426 --> 0:41:39,5
This makes indigenous resources
available to predator countries


734
0:41:39,5 --> 0:41:42,399
at a fraction of their worth.


735
0:41:42,399 --> 0:41:45,1
Large funding cuts
for social programs.


736
0:41:45,1 --> 0:41:48,4
These usually include
education and healthcare


737
0:41:48,4 --> 0:41:51,25
compromising the well-being
and integrity of the society


738
0:41:51,25 --> 0:41:54,578
leaving the public
vulnerable to exploitation.


739
0:41:54,578 --> 0:41:57,381
Privatization of
state-owned enterprises.


740
0:41:57,381 --> 0:42:0,6
This means that socially
important systems


741
0:42:0,6 --> 0:42:4,65
can be purchased and regulated by
foreign corporations for profit.


742
0:42:4,65 --> 0:42:8,275
For example, in 1999,
the World Bank insisted


743
0:42:8,275 --> 0:42:10,11
that the Bolivian
government sell


744
0:42:10,11 --> 0:42:13,381
the public water-system
of its third-largest city


745
0:42:13,381 --> 0:42:16,74
to a subsidiary of the US
corporation "Bechtel."


746
0:42:16,74 --> 0:42:18,736
As soon as this
occurred, water bills


747
0:42:18,736 --> 0:42:22,973
for the already impoverished
local residents, skyrocketed.


748
0:42:22,973 --> 0:42:26,28
It wasn't until after a
full-blown revolt by the people


749
0:42:26,28 --> 0:42:31,982
that the Bechtel
contract was nullified.


750
0:42:31,982 --> 0:42:34,652
Then there is trade
liberalization


751
0:42:34,652 --> 0:42:36,761
or the opening up of the economy


752
0:42:36,761 --> 0:42:39,56
through removing any
restrictions on foreign trade.


753
0:42:39,56 --> 0:42:43,47
This allows for a number of
abusive economic manifestations


754
0:42:43,47 --> 0:42:45,659
such as transnational
corporations


755
0:42:45,659 --> 0:42:48,465
bringing in their own
mass-produced products


756
0:42:48,465 --> 0:42:52,95
undercutting the indigenous production
and ruining local economies.


757
0:42:52,95 --> 0:42:55,33
An example is Jamaica;


758
0:42:55,33 --> 0:42:59,24
which, after accepting loans and
conditionalities from the World Bank


759
0:42:59,24 --> 0:43:1,629
lost its largest
cash crop markets


760
0:43:1,629 --> 0:43:4,982
due to competition
with Western imports.


761
0:43:4,982 --> 0:43:8,986
Today, countless farmers are out of
work for they're unable to compete


762
0:43:8,986 --> 0:43:11,989
with the large corporations.


763
0:43:11,989 --> 0:43:14,847
Another variation is the
creation of numerous


764
0:43:14,847 --> 0:43:20,9
seemingly unnoticed, unregulated,
inhumane sweatshop-factories


765
0:43:20,9 --> 0:43:24,11
which take advantage of the
imposed economic hardship.


766
0:43:24,11 --> 0:43:27,47
Additionally, due to
production deregulation


767
0:43:27,47 --> 0:43:31,6
environmental destruction is
perpetual, as a country's resources


768
0:43:31,6 --> 0:43:33,978
are often exploited by the
indifferent corporations


769
0:43:33,978 --> 0:43:38,248
while outputting large amounts
of deliberate pollution.


770
0:43:38,248 --> 0:43:41,962
-The largest environmental lawsuit
in the history of the world


771
0:43:41,962 --> 0:43:43,84
today is being
brought on behalf of


772
0:43:43,84 --> 0:43:46,991
30,000 Ecuadorian and
Amazonian people


773
0:43:46,991 --> 0:43:50,243
against Texaco, which is
now owned by Chevron;


774
0:43:50,243 --> 0:43:54,2
so it's against Chevron, but for
activities conducted by Texaco.


775
0:43:54,2 --> 0:43:56,852
They're estimated to
be more than 18 times


776
0:43:56,852 --> 0:44:0,971
what the Exxon Valdez dumped
into the Coast of Alaska.


777
0:44:0,971 --> 0:44:3,801
In the case of Ecuador
it wasn't an accident.


778
0:44:3,801 --> 0:44:6,491
The oil companies did it intentionally.
They knew they were doing it


779
0:44:6,491 --> 0:44:12,0
to save money rather than
arranging for proper disposal.


780
0:44:12,0 --> 0:44:13,85
-Furthermore, a cursory glance


781
0:44:13,85 --> 0:44:16,0
at the performance
record of the World Bank


782
0:44:16,0 --> 0:44:18,989
reveals that the institution,
which publicly claims to


783
0:44:18,989 --> 0:44:22,6
help poor countries develop
and alleviate poverty


784
0:44:22,6 --> 0:44:25,4
has done nothing but increase
poverty and the wealth-gap


785
0:44:25,4 --> 0:44:27,6
while corporate profits soar.


786
0:44:27,6 --> 0:44:30,498
In 1960, the
income-gap between the


787
0:44:30,498 --> 0:44:33,345
fifth of the world's people
in the richest countries


788
0:44:33,345 --> 0:44:37,408
versus the fifth in the poorest
countries was thirty to one.


789
0:44:37,408 --> 0:44:41,779
By 1998, it was
seventy-four to one.


790
0:44:41,779 --> 0:44:47,0
While global GNP rose 40%
between 1970 and 1985


791
0:44:47,0 --> 0:44:51,3
those in poverty actually
increased by 17%.


792
0:44:51,3 --> 0:44:53,904
While from 1985 to 2000


793
0:44:53,904 --> 0:45:0,55
those living on less than one
dollar a day increased by 18%.


794
0:45:0,55 --> 0:45:4,35
Even the Joint Economic
Committee of the U.S. Congress


795
0:45:4,35 --> 0:45:7,48
admitted that there is a
mere 40% success rate


796
0:45:7,48 --> 0:45:9,94
of all World Bank projects.


797
0:45:9,94 --> 0:45:12,35
In the late 1960's,
the World Bank


798
0:45:12,35 --> 0:45:15,7
intervened in Ecuador
with large loans.


799
0:45:15,7 --> 0:45:19,93
During the next 30 years,
poverty grew from 50% to 70%.


800
0:45:19,93 --> 0:45:24,52
Under or unemployment
grew from 15% to 70%.


801
0:45:24,52 --> 0:45:29,48
Public debt increased from
240 million to 16 billion


802
0:45:29,48 --> 0:45:32,59
while the share of resources
allocated to the poor


803
0:45:32,59 --> 0:45:36,14
went from 20% to 6%.


804
0:45:36,14 --> 0:45:41,3
In fact, by the year 2000, 50%
of Ecuador's national budget


805
0:45:41,3 --> 0:45:47,33
had to be allocated
for paying its debts.


806
0:45:47,33 --> 0:45:50,82
It is important to understand:
The World Bank is, in fact


807
0:45:50,82 --> 0:45:54,27
a U.S. bank, supporting U.
S. interests.


808
0:45:54,27 --> 0:45:57,82
For the United States holds
veto-power over decisions


809
0:45:57,82 --> 0:46:0,46
as it is the largest
provider of capital.


810
0:46:0,46 --> 0:46:2,43
And where did it get this money?


811
0:46:2,43 --> 0:46:4,82
You guessed it.
It made it out of thin air


812
0:46:4,82 --> 0:46:9,37
through the fractional
reserve banking system.


813
0:46:9,37 --> 0:46:14,2
Of the world's top 100 economies,
as based on annual GDP


814
0:46:14,2 --> 0:46:19,92
51 are corporations and 47
of that 51 are U.S.-based.


815
0:46:19,92 --> 0:46:24,88
Walmart, General Motors and Exxon
are more economically powerful


816
0:46:24,88 --> 0:46:29,41
than Saudi Arabia, Poland,
Norway, South Africa


817
0:46:29,41 --> 0:46:32,85
Finland, Indonesia
and many others.


818
0:46:32,85 --> 0:46:36,38
And, as protective trade
barriers are broken down


819
0:46:36,38 --> 0:46:39,88
currencies tossed together and
manipulated in floating markets


820
0:46:39,88 --> 0:46:44,2
and State economies overturned
in favor of open competition


821
0:46:44,2 --> 0:46:49,8
in global capitalism,
the empire expands.


822
0:46:49,8 --> 0:46:55,22
-You get up on your
little 21-inch screen


823
0:46:55,22 --> 0:47:0,46
and howl about America
and democracy.


824
0:47:0,46 --> 0:47:5,1
There is no America,
there is no democracy.


825
0:47:5,1 --> 0:47:10,73
There is only IBM,
and ITT, and AT&T


826
0:47:10,73 --> 0:47:16,55
and Dupont, Dow, Union
Carbide, and Exxon.


827
0:47:16,55 --> 0:47:20,63
Those are the nations
of the world today.


828
0:47:20,63 --> 0:47:23,6
What do you think the Russians talk
about in their councils of state?


829
0:47:23,6 --> 0:47:24,76
Karl Marx?


830
0:47:24,76 --> 0:47:27,22
They get out their linear
programming charts


831
0:47:27,22 --> 0:47:29,9
statistical decision theories,
min and max solutions


832
0:47:29,9 --> 0:47:31,85
and compute the
price-cost probabilities


833
0:47:31,85 --> 0:47:35,18
of their transactions and
investments, just like we do.


834
0:47:35,18 --> 0:47:39,7
We no longer live in a world of
nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale.


835
0:47:39,7 --> 0:47:45,5
The world is a college
of corporations


836
0:47:45,5 --> 0:47:53,88
inexorably determined by the
immutable by-laws of business.


837
0:47:53,88 --> 0:47:58,97
The world is a business, Mr.
Beale.


838
0:47:58,97 --> 0:48:2,4
"Taken cumulatively, the integration
of the world as a whole


839
0:48:2,4 --> 0:48:5,5
particularly in terms of
economic globalization


840
0:48:5,5 --> 0:48:7,7
and the mythic qualities of
"free market" capitalism


841
0:48:7,7 --> 0:48:10,35
represents a veritable
"empire" in its own right.


842
0:48:10,35 --> 0:48:12,999
Few have been able to escape the
"structural adjustment" and


843
0:48:12,999 --> 0:48:13,0
.


844
0:48:13,0 --> 0:48:15,65
"conditionalities" of the W.
B, the IMF, or the WTO


845
0:48:15,65 --> 0:48:18,3
those international financial
institutions that, however inadequate


846
0:48:18,3 --> 0:48:20,95
still determine what economic
globalization means.


847
0:48:20,95 --> 0:48:23,75
Such is the power of globalization that,
within our lifetime, we are likely to see


848
0:48:23,75 --> 0:48:26,249
the integration, even if unevenly, of
all national economies in the world


849
0:48:26,249 --> 0:48:26,25
.


850
0:48:26,25 --> 0:48:28,4
into a single global,
free market system."


851
0:48:28,4 --> 0:48:32,42
-The World is being taken over
by a handful of business powers


852
0:48:32,42 --> 0:48:35,29
who dominate the natural
resources we need to live


853
0:48:35,29 --> 0:48:38,92
while controlling the money we
need to obtain these resources.


854
0:48:38,92 --> 0:48:42,8
The end result will
be world monopoly


855
0:48:42,8 --> 0:48:47,4
based not on human life but
financial and corporate power.


856
0:48:47,4 --> 0:48:50,54
And, as the inequality
grows, naturally


857
0:48:50,54 --> 0:48:53,45
more and more people are
becoming desperate.


858
0:48:53,45 --> 0:48:56,97
So the establishment was forced
to come up with a new way


859
0:48:56,97 --> 0:49:0,35
to deal with anyone who
challenges the system.


860
0:49:0,35 --> 0:49:3,78
So they gave birth
to the "Terrorist."


861
0:49:3,78 --> 0:49:6,955
The term "terrorist" is
an empty distinction


862
0:49:6,955 --> 0:49:9,25
designed for any person or group


863
0:49:9,25 --> 0:49:11,94
who chooses to challenge
the establishment.


864
0:49:11,94 --> 0:49:15,39
This isn't to be confused
with the fictional "Al Qaida"


865
0:49:15,39 --> 0:49:18,31
which was actually the name
of a computer database


866
0:49:18,31 --> 0:49:22,37
of the U.S.
-supported Mujahideen in the 1980's.


867
0:49:22,37 --> 0:49:24,8
"The truth is, there is no
Islamic army or terrorist group


868
0:49:24,8 --> 0:49:27,6
called Al Qaida. And any informed
intelligence officer knows this.


869
0:49:27,6 --> 0:49:29,8
But there is a propaganda campaign
to make the public believe


870
0:49:29,8 --> 0:49:31,4
in the presence of an identified entity...
The country behind this propaganda is the U.S."


871
0:49:31,4 --> 0:49:33,63
- Pierre-Henri Bunel, Former
French Military Intelligence


872
0:49:33,63 --> 0:49:35,34
In 2007


873
0:49:35,34 --> 0:49:40,45
the Department of Defense
received 161.8 billion dollars


874
0:49:40,45 --> 0:49:43,26
for the so-called global
war on terrorism.


875
0:49:43,26 --> 0:49:46,16
According to the national
counter-terrorism center


876
0:49:46,16 --> 0:49:50,78
in 2004 roughly 2000 people
were killed internationally


877
0:49:50,78 --> 0:49:53,185
due to supposed terrorist acts.


878
0:49:53,185 --> 0:49:56,4
Of that number,
70 were American.


879
0:49:56,4 --> 0:50:0,7
Using this number as a general
average, which is extremely generous


880
0:50:0,7 --> 0:50:4,12
it is interesting to note
that twice as many people die


881
0:50:4,12 --> 0:50:9,8
from peanut allergies a year
than from terrorist acts.


882
0:50:9,8 --> 0:50:12,6
Concurrently, the leading
cause of death in America


883
0:50:12,6 --> 0:50:18,24
is coronary heart disease, killing
roughly 450,000 each year.


884
0:50:18,24 --> 0:50:22,94
And in 2007, the government's
allocation of funds for research


885
0:50:22,94 --> 0:50:25,98
on this issue was about
three billion dollars.


886
0:50:25,98 --> 0:50:29,342
This means that the US
government, in 2007


887
0:50:29,342 --> 0:50:33,9
spent 54 times the amount
for preventing terrorism


888
0:50:33,9 --> 0:50:36,64
than it spent for
preventing a disease


889
0:50:36,64 --> 0:50:45,96
which kills 6600 times more people
annually, than terrorism does.


890
0:50:45,96 --> 0:50:50,24
Yet, as the name terrorism and
Al Qaida are arbitrarily stamped


891
0:50:50,24 --> 0:50:54,851
on every news report relating to any
action taken against US interests


892
0:50:54,851 --> 0:50:56,8
the myth grows wider.


893
0:50:56,8 --> 0:51:0,86
In mid 2008, the US Attorney
General actually proposed


894
0:51:0,86 --> 0:51:6,159
that the US Congress officially
declare war against the fantasy.


895
0:51:6,159 --> 0:51:6,163
.


896
0:51:6,163 --> 0:51:11,77
Not to mention, as of July 2008,
there are now over 1 million people


897
0:51:11,77 --> 0:51:16,973
currently on the US
terrorist watch list.


898
0:51:16,973 --> 0:51:19,523
These so called
"Counter-Terrorism Measures"


899
0:51:19,523 --> 0:51:22,4
of course, have nothing to
do with social protection


900
0:51:22,4 --> 0:51:25,982
and everything to do with
preserving the establishment


901
0:51:25,982 --> 0:51:28,84
amongst the growing
anti-American sentiment


902
0:51:28,84 --> 0:51:31,87
both domestically
and internationally


903
0:51:31,87 --> 0:51:33,812
which is legitimately founded on


904
0:51:33,812 --> 0:51:36,993
the greed-based corporate
empire expansion


905
0:51:36,993 --> 0:51:40,63
that is exploiting the world.


906
0:51:40,63 --> 0:51:45,3
The true terrorists of our world, do
not meet at the docks at midnight


907
0:51:45,3 --> 0:51:49,906
or scream "Allah Akbar"
before some violent action.


908
0:51:49,906 --> 0:51:54,1
The true terrorists of our
world wear 5000 dollar suits


909
0:51:54,1 --> 0:52:2,586
and work in the highest positions of
finance, government and business.


910
0:52:2,586 --> 0:52:5,23
So, what do we do?


911
0:52:5,23 --> 0:52:7,98
How do we stop a system
of greed and corruption


912
0:52:7,98 --> 0:52:9,993
that has so much
power and momentum?


913
0:52:9,993 --> 0:52:14,3
How do we stop this aberrant group
behavior, which feels no compassion


914
0:52:14,3 --> 0:52:18,2
for say, the millions slaughtered
in Iraq and Afghanistan


915
0:52:18,2 --> 0:52:20,493
so the corporatocracy
can control


916
0:52:20,493 --> 0:52:27,978
energy resources and opium
production for Wall St. profit?


917
0:52:27,978 --> 0:52:32,35
Before 1980, Afghanistan produced
0% of the world's opium.


918
0:52:32,35 --> 0:52:35,35
After the US/CIA backed Mujahideen
won the Soviet/Afghan war


919
0:52:35,35 --> 0:52:38,6
by 1986 they were producing 40%
of the world's heroin supply.


920
0:52:38,6 --> 0:52:44,39
By 1988, they were producing 80%
of the total market supply.


921
0:52:44,39 --> 0:52:48,999
But then, something
unexpected happened.


922
0:52:48,999 --> 0:52:53,8
The Taliban rose to power and by 2000, they
had destroyed most of the opium fields.


923
0:52:53,8 --> 0:52:57,27
Production dropped from 3000+ tons
to only 185 tons, a 94% reduction.


924
0:52:57,27 --> 0:53:2,979
On Sept. 9th 2001, the full Afghanistan
invasion plans were on President Bush's Desk.


925
0:53:2,979 --> 0:53:8,985
Two days later they
had their excuse.


926
0:53:8,985 --> 0:53:11,7
Today, opium productions in
US controlled Afghanistan


927
0:53:11,7 --> 0:53:14,5
which now provides more than
90% of the world's heroin


928
0:53:14,5 --> 0:53:17,491
breaks new production
records nearly every year.


929
0:53:17,491 --> 0:53:19,796
How do we stop a system
of greed and corruption


930
0:53:19,796 --> 0:53:23,4
that condemns poor populations
to "Sweatshop-Slavery"


931
0:53:23,4 --> 0:53:25,969
for the benefit of
Madison Avenue?


932
0:53:25,969 --> 0:53:29,169
Or that engineers
false-flag terror attacks


933
0:53:29,169 --> 0:53:31,641
for the sake of manipulation?


934
0:53:31,641 --> 0:53:35,242
Or that generates built-in
modes of social operation


935
0:53:35,242 --> 0:53:37,981
which are inherently
exploitative?


936
0:53:37,981 --> 0:53:41,551
Or that systematically
reduces civil liberties


937
0:53:41,551 --> 0:53:43,2
and violates human rights


938
0:53:43,2 --> 0:53:47,591
in order to protect itself
from its own shortcomings.


939
0:53:47,591 --> 0:53:50,76
How do we deal with the
numerous covert institutions


940
0:53:50,76 --> 0:53:52,758
such as the Council
on Foreign Relations


941
0:53:52,758 --> 0:53:55,28
the Trilateral Commission
and the Bilderberg Group


942
0:53:55,28 --> 0:53:57,7
and other undemocratically
elected groups


943
0:53:57,7 --> 0:54:2,57
which, behind closed doors
collude to control the political


944
0:54:2,57 --> 0:54:7,2
financial, social and environmental
elements of our lives?


945
0:54:7,2 --> 0:54:10,86
In order to find the
answer, we must first find


946
0:54:10,86 --> 0:54:13,25
the true underlying cause.


947
0:54:13,25 --> 0:54:15,171
For the fact is:


948
0:54:15,171 --> 0:54:19,298
The selfish, corrupt power
and profit- based groups


949
0:54:19,298 --> 0:54:22,559
are not the true
source of the problem.


950
0:54:22,559 --> 0:54:25,6
They are symptoms.


951
0:54:25,6 --> 0:54:30,4
"Greed and Competition are not the
result of immutable human temperament...


952
0:54:30,4 --> 0:54:34,5
...greed and fear of scarcity are in
fact being created and amplified...


953
0:54:34,5 --> 0:54:39,0
the direct consequence is that we have to
fight with each other in order to survive.


954
0:54:39,0 --> 0:54:41,2
- Bernard Liertaer
- Founder of the EU Currency System


955
0:54:41,2 --> 0:54:44,12
-My name is Jacque Fresco.


956
0:54:44,12 --> 0:54:48,8
I'm an industrial designer
and a social engineer.


957
0:54:48,8 --> 0:54:52,13
I'm very much
interested in society


958
0:54:52,13 --> 0:54:58,75
and developing a system that might
be sustainable, for all people.


959
0:54:58,75 --> 0:55:2,48
First of all, the word "corruption"
is a monetary invention


960
0:55:2,48 --> 0:55:4,62
that aberrant behavior


961
0:55:4,62 --> 0:55:8,56
behavior that's disruptive
to the well-being of people.


962
0:55:8,56 --> 0:55:12,2
Well you're dealing
with human behavior.


963
0:55:12,2 --> 0:55:16,76
And human behavior appears to
be environmentally determined.


964
0:55:16,76 --> 0:55:21,54
Meaning, if you were raised by
the Seminole Indians as a baby


965
0:55:21,54 --> 0:55:25,46
never saw anything else, you'd
hold that value system.


966
0:55:25,46 --> 0:55:30,29
And this goes for nations, it goes
for individuals, for families.


967
0:55:30,29 --> 0:55:34,66
They try to indoctrinate their
children to their particular faith


968
0:55:34,66 --> 0:55:39,28
and their country and make them
feel like they're part of that.


969
0:55:39,28 --> 0:55:44,35
And they build a society,
which they call established.


970
0:55:44,35 --> 0:55:49,36
They established a workable point of
view and tend to perpetuate that.


971
0:55:49,36 --> 0:55:54,93
Whereas, all societies are really
emergent, not established.


972
0:55:54,93 --> 0:55:58,2
And so they fight new ideas


973
0:55:58,2 --> 0:56:1,95
that would interfere
with the establishment.


974
0:56:1,95 --> 0:56:6,79
Governments try to perpetuate
that which keeps them in power.


975
0:56:6,79 --> 0:56:11,86
People are not elected to political
office to change things.


976
0:56:11,86 --> 0:56:15,66
They are put there to keep
things the way they are.


977
0:56:15,66 --> 0:56:20,0
So you see, the basis of
corruption is in our society.


978
0:56:20,0 --> 0:56:24,79
Let me make it clear.
All nations then are basically corrupt


979
0:56:24,79 --> 0:56:28,52
because they tend to uphold
existing institutions.


980
0:56:28,52 --> 0:56:32,2
I don't mean to uphold
or downgrade all nations


981
0:56:32,2 --> 0:56:36,79
but communism, socialism, fascism,
the free enterprise-system


982
0:56:36,79 --> 0:56:40,49
and all other sub-cultures
are the same.


983
0:56:40,49 --> 0:56:45,0
They are all basically corrupt.


984
0:56:45,0 --> 0:56:48,53
-The most fundamental characteristic
of our social institutions


985
0:56:48,53 --> 0:56:51,64
is the necessity for
self-preservation.


986
0:56:51,64 --> 0:56:55,45
Whether dealing with a corporation,
a religion or a government


987
0:56:55,45 --> 0:56:59,4
the foremost interest is to
preserve the institution itself.


988
0:56:59,4 --> 0:57:2,53
For instance, the last thing
an oil company would ever want


989
0:57:2,53 --> 0:57:6,48
is the utilization of energy
that was outside of its control.


990
0:57:6,48 --> 0:57:10,6
For it makes that company
less relevant to society.


991
0:57:10,6 --> 0:57:13,61
Likewise the Cold War and the
collapse of the Soviet Union


992
0:57:13,61 --> 0:57:17,35
was, in reality, a way to
preserve and perpetuate


993
0:57:17,35 --> 0:57:23,43
the established economic and global
hegemony of the United States.


994
0:57:23,43 --> 0:57:25,73
Similarly, religions
condition people


995
0:57:25,73 --> 0:57:28,3
to feel guilty for
natural inclinations


996
0:57:28,3 --> 0:57:33,28
each claiming to offer the only
path to forgiveness and salvation.


997
0:57:33,28 --> 0:57:36,32
At the heart of this
institutional self-preservation


998
0:57:36,32 --> 0:57:38,46
lies the monetary system


999
0:57:38,46 --> 0:57:43,32
for it is money that provides the
means for power and survival.


1000
0:57:43,32 --> 0:57:45,19
Therefore, just as a poor person


1001
0:57:45,19 --> 0:57:47,72
might be forced to steal
in order to survive


1002
0:57:47,72 --> 0:57:50,89
it is a natural inclination
to do whatever is needed


1003
0:57:50,89 --> 0:57:53,76
to continue an institution's
profitability.


1004
0:57:53,76 --> 0:57:55,87
This makes it
inherently difficult


1005
0:57:55,87 --> 0:58:0,8
for profit-based institutions to
change, for it puts in jeopardy


1006
0:58:0,8 --> 0:58:2,73
not only the survival of
large groups of people


1007
0:58:2,73 --> 0:58:5,49
but also the coveted
materialistic lifestyles


1008
0:58:5,49 --> 0:58:9,9
associated with
affluence and power.


1009
0:58:9,9 --> 0:58:12,78
Therefore, the paralyzing necessity
to preserve an institution


1010
0:58:12,78 --> 0:58:15,0
regardless of its
social relevance


1011
0:58:15,0 --> 0:58:21,0
is largely rooted in the
need for money or profit.


1012
0:58:21,0 --> 0:58:23,88
[ Industry ]


1013
0:58:23,88 --> 0:58:28,27
- "What's in it for me?
" is the way people think.


1014
0:58:28,27 --> 0:58:31,82
And so if a man makes money
selling a certain product


1015
0:58:31,82 --> 0:58:35,85
that's where he's going to fight
the existence of another product


1016
0:58:35,85 --> 0:58:39,94
that may threaten
his institution.


1017
0:58:39,94 --> 0:58:43,3
Therefore, people
cannot be fair.


1018
0:58:43,3 --> 0:58:45,33
And people do not
trust each other.


1019
0:58:45,33 --> 0:58:47,11
A guy will come
over to you and say


1020
0:58:47,11 --> 0:58:50,5
"I've got just the house you're looking for.
" He's a salesman.


1021
0:58:50,5 --> 0:58:53,74
When a doctor says, "I think
your kidney has to come out."


1022
0:58:53,74 --> 0:58:56,69
I don't know if he's
trying to pay off a yacht


1023
0:58:56,69 --> 0:58:58,67
or that my kidney
has to come out.


1024
0:58:58,67 --> 0:59:3,275
It's hard in a monetary
system to trust people.


1025
0:59:3,275 --> 0:59:6,72
If you came into my store and I
said, "This lamp that I've got


1026
0:59:6,72 --> 0:59:10,4
is pretty good, but the lamp
next door is much better."


1027
0:59:10,4 --> 0:59:13,28
I wouldn't be in business very long.
It wouldn't work.


1028
0:59:13,28 --> 0:59:16,62
If I were ethical,
it wouldn't work.


1029
0:59:16,62 --> 0:59:21,6
So when you say industry cares
for people, that's not true.


1030
0:59:21,6 --> 0:59:24,12
They can't afford to be ethical.


1031
0:59:24,12 --> 0:59:28,61
So your system is not designed to
serve the well-being of people.


1032
0:59:28,61 --> 0:59:33,96
If you still don't understand that
there would be no outsourcing of jobs


1033
0:59:33,96 --> 0:59:35,98
if they cared about people.


1034
0:59:35,98 --> 0:59:38,48
Industry does not care.
They only hire people


1035
0:59:38,48 --> 0:59:42,4
because it hasn't
been automated yet.


1036
0:59:42,4 --> 0:59:45,15
So don't talk about
decency and ethics.


1037
0:59:45,15 --> 0:59:49,77
We cannot afford it and
remain in business.


1038
0:59:49,77 --> 0:59:53,82
-It is important to point out that
regardless of the social system -


1039
0:59:53,82 --> 0:59:57,9
whether fascist, socialist,
capitalist or communist


1040
0:59:57,9 --> 1:0:3,409
the underlying mechanism is still
money, labor and competition.


1041
1:0:3,409 --> 1:0:7,718
Communist China is no less
capitalistic than the United States.


1042
1:0:7,718 --> 1:0:9,36
The only difference
is the degree


1043
1:0:9,36 --> 1:0:13,2
by which the state
intervenes in enterprise.


1044
1:0:13,2 --> 1:0:16,53
The reality is that
"Monetary-ism", so to speak


1045
1:0:16,53 --> 1:0:19,3
is the true mechanism
that guides the interests


1046
1:0:19,3 --> 1:0:22,11
of all the countries
on the planet.


1047
1:0:22,11 --> 1:0:24,35
The most aggressive and
hence dominant variation


1048
1:0:24,35 --> 1:0:28,5
of this monetary-ism is the
free enterprise system.


1049
1:0:28,5 --> 1:0:30,472
The fundamental
perspective, as put forth


1050
1:0:30,472 --> 1:0:34,5
by early free market
economists like Adam Smith


1051
1:0:34,5 --> 1:0:38,44
is that self interest and competition
leads to social prosperity


1052
1:0:38,44 --> 1:0:41,7
as the act of competition
creates incentive


1053
1:0:41,7 --> 1:0:45,3
which motivates
people to persevere.


1054
1:0:45,3 --> 1:0:49,541
However, what isn't talked about,
is how a competition based economy


1055
1:0:49,541 --> 1:0:52,42
invariably leads to
strategic corruption


1056
1:0:52,42 --> 1:0:56,464
power and wealth consolidation,
social stratification


1057
1:0:56,464 --> 1:1:2,34
technological paralysis, labor
abuse and ultimately a covert form


1058
1:1:2,34 --> 1:1:7,8
of government dictatorship
by the rich elite.


1059
1:1:7,8 --> 1:1:12,0
The word "corruption" is often
defined as moral perversion.


1060
1:1:12,0 --> 1:1:15,8
If a company dumps toxic waste
into the ocean to save money


1061
1:1:15,8 --> 1:1:19,94
most people recognize this
as "corrupt behavior".


1062
1:1:19,94 --> 1:1:23,82
On a more subtle level, when
Walmart moves into a small town


1063
1:1:23,82 --> 1:1:26,436
and forces small
businesses to shut down


1064
1:1:26,436 --> 1:1:30,5
for they are unable to compete,
a grey area emerges.


1065
1:1:30,5 --> 1:1:33,29
For what exactly is
Walmart doing wrong?


1066
1:1:33,29 --> 1:1:37,52
Why should they care about the Mom
and Pop organizations they destroy?


1067
1:1:37,52 --> 1:1:41,8
Yet, even more subtly, when a
person gets fired from their job


1068
1:1:41,8 --> 1:1:44,11
because a new machine
has been created


1069
1:1:44,11 --> 1:1:46,33
which can do the
work for less money


1070
1:1:46,33 --> 1:1:49,885
people tend to just accept
that as "the way it is"


1071
1:1:49,885 --> 1:1:49,905
.


1072
1:1:49,905 --> 1:1:55,53
not seeing the inherent corrupt
inhumanity of such an action.


1073
1:1:55,53 --> 1:1:59,44
Because the fact is, whether
it is dumping toxic waste


1074
1:1:59,44 --> 1:2:3,32
having a monopoly enterprise
or downsizing the workforce


1075
1:2:3,32 --> 1:2:6,939
the motive is the same: Profit.


1076
1:2:6,939 --> 1:2:6,94
.


1077
1:2:6,94 --> 1:2:11,2
They are all different degrees of
the same self-preserving mechanism


1078
1:2:11,2 --> 1:2:16,42
which always puts the well-being
of people second to monetary gain.


1079
1:2:16,42 --> 1:2:21,93
Therefore, corruption is not
some byproduct of monetary-ism


1080
1:2:21,93 --> 1:2:24,96
it is the very foundation.


1081
1:2:24,96 --> 1:2:27,2
And while most people
acknowledge this tendency


1082
1:2:27,2 --> 1:2:30,557
on one level or another,
the majority remains naive


1083
1:2:30,557 --> 1:2:32,93
as to the broad ramifications


1084
1:2:32,93 --> 1:2:35,545
of having such a
selfish mechanism


1085
1:2:35,545 --> 1:2:38,576
as the guiding
mentality in society.


1086
1:2:38,576 --> 1:2:40,2
-Internal documents show


1087
1:2:40,2 --> 1:2:43,69
that after this company
positively absolutely knew


1088
1:2:43,69 --> 1:2:46,831
that they had a medication that
was infected with the AIDS virus


1089
1:2:46,831 --> 1:2:49,23
they took the product off
the market in the US


1090
1:2:49,23 --> 1:2:52,34
and then they dumped it in France,
Europe, Asia and Latin America.


1091
1:2:52,34 --> 1:2:54,85
The US government
allowed it to happen.


1092
1:2:54,85 --> 1:2:57,15
The FDA allowed this to happen


1093
1:2:57,15 --> 1:2:59,9
and now the government is
completely looking the other way.


1094
1:2:59,9 --> 1:3:4,96
Thousands of innocent hemophiliacs
have died from the AIDS virus.


1095
1:3:4,96 --> 1:3:8,38
This company knew absolutely
that it was infected with AIDS,


1096
1:3:8,38 --> 1:3:15,4
they dumped it because they wanted
to turn this disaster into a profit.


1097
1:3:15,4 --> 1:3:19,14
-So you see, you have
built-in corruption.


1098
1:3:19,14 --> 1:3:21,54
We're all chiseling
off each other


1099
1:3:21,54 --> 1:3:26,302
and you can't expect decency
or that sort of thing.


1100
1:3:26,302 --> 1:3:28,73
Politics


1101
1:3:28,73 --> 1:3:32,0
...a feeling that they
don't know who to elect.


1102
1:3:32,0 --> 1:3:34,24
They think in terms
of a democracy


1103
1:3:34,24 --> 1:3:39,0
which is not possible in a
monetary based economy.


1104
1:3:39,0 --> 1:3:42,68
If you have more money to
advertise your position


1105
1:3:42,68 --> 1:3:46,749
the position you desire in
government, that isn't a democracy.


1106
1:3:46,749 --> 1:3:46,75
.


1107
1:3:46,75 --> 1:3:51,46
It serves those in positions
of differential advantage.


1108
1:3:51,46 --> 1:3:56,519
So it's always a dictatorship of the
elitist, the financially wealthy.


1109
1:3:56,519 --> 1:3:56,9
.


1110
1:3:56,9 --> 1:3:59,35
"We can either have democracy
in this country or


1111
1:3:59,35 --> 1:4:2,25
we can have great wealth
concentrated in the hands of a few,


1112
1:4:2,25 --> 1:4:4,728
but we can't have both."
- Louis Brandeis - Supreme Court Justice


1113
1:4:4,728 --> 1:4:6,74
-It is an interesting
observation


1114
1:4:6,74 --> 1:4:9,9
to note how seemingly
unknown personalities


1115
1:4:9,9 --> 1:4:13,71
magically appear on the scene
as presidential candidates.


1116
1:4:13,71 --> 1:4:16,5
Then before you know it,
somehow you are left to choose


1117
1:4:16,5 --> 1:4:19,98
from a small group of
extremely wealthy people


1118
1:4:19,98 --> 1:4:24,73
who suspiciously have the
same broad social view.


1119
1:4:24,73 --> 1:4:26,72
Obviously it's a joke.


1120
1:4:26,72 --> 1:4:28,89
The people placed on
the ballot are done so


1121
1:4:28,89 --> 1:4:32,7
because they have been
pre-decided to be acceptable


1122
1:4:32,7 --> 1:4:37,33
by the established financial
powers who actually run the show.


1123
1:4:37,33 --> 1:4:41,98
Yet many who understand this
illusion of democracy, often think


1124
1:4:41,98 --> 1:4:46,83
"If only we could just get our honest,
ethical politicians in power,


1125
1:4:46,83 --> 1:4:48,95
then we would be okay".


1126
1:4:48,95 --> 1:4:51,74
Well, while this idea, of
course, seems reasonable


1127
1:4:51,74 --> 1:4:55,9
in our established
oriented world view


1128
1:4:55,9 --> 1:4:59,24
it is unfortunately
another fallacy.


1129
1:4:59,24 --> 1:5:3,112
For when it really comes down
to what is actually important,


1130
1:5:3,112 --> 1:5:7,39
the institution of politics and
thus politicians themselves


1131
1:5:7,39 --> 1:5:10,79
have absolutely no
true relevance as to


1132
1:5:10,79 --> 1:5:14,815
what makes our world
and society function.


1133
1:5:14,815 --> 1:5:18,12
-It's not politicians
that can solve problems.


1134
1:5:18,12 --> 1:5:20,85
They have no technical
capabilities.


1135
1:5:20,85 --> 1:5:23,12
They don't know how
to solve problems.


1136
1:5:23,12 --> 1:5:27,13
Even if they were sincere, they
don't know how to solve problems.


1137
1:5:27,13 --> 1:5:32,15
It's the technicians that produce
the desalinization plants.


1138
1:5:32,15 --> 1:5:34,77
It's the technicians that
give you electricity.


1139
1:5:34,77 --> 1:5:36,5
That give you motor vehicles.


1140
1:5:36,5 --> 1:5:39,4
That heat your house and
cool it in the summer time.


1141
1:5:39,4 --> 1:5:43,37
It's technology that solves
problems, not politics.


1142
1:5:43,37 --> 1:5:49,4
Politics cannot solve problems 'cause
they are not trained to do so.


1143
1:5:49,4 --> 1:5:52,25
-Very few people today
stop and consider


1144
1:5:52,25 --> 1:5:55,72
what it is that actually
improves their lives.


1145
1:5:55,72 --> 1:5:58,5
Is it money? Obviously not.


1146
1:5:58,5 --> 1:6:3,2
One cannot eat money or stuff money
into their car to get it to run.


1147
1:6:3,2 --> 1:6:5,36
Is it politics?


1148
1:6:5,36 --> 1:6:8,3
All politicians can
do is create laws


1149
1:6:8,3 --> 1:6:11,45
establish budgets
and declare war.


1150
1:6:11,45 --> 1:6:13,69
Is it religion? Of course not.


1151
1:6:13,69 --> 1:6:15,91
Religion creates nothing except


1152
1:6:15,91 --> 1:6:19,85
intangible emotional solace
for those who require it.


1153
1:6:19,85 --> 1:6:23,78
The true gift that we
as human beings have


1154
1:6:23,78 --> 1:6:26,73
which has been solely
responsible for everything


1155
1:6:26,73 --> 1:6:29,0
that has improved our lives


1156
1:6:29,0 --> 1:6:31,79
is technology.


1157
1:6:31,79 --> 1:6:33,53
What is technology?


1158
1:6:33,53 --> 1:6:35,4
Technology is a pencil


1159
1:6:35,4 --> 1:6:39,44
which allows one to solidify ideas
on paper for communication.


1160
1:6:39,44 --> 1:6:43,14
Technology is an automobile, which
allows one to travel faster


1161
1:6:43,14 --> 1:6:44,78
than feet would allow.


1162
1:6:44,78 --> 1:6:47,35
Technology is a
pair of eye glasses


1163
1:6:47,35 --> 1:6:50,9
which enables sight for
those who need it.


1164
1:6:50,9 --> 1:6:56,43
Applied technology itself is merely
an extension of human attributes


1165
1:6:56,43 --> 1:6:58,469
which reduces human effort


1166
1:6:58,469 --> 1:7:1,97
freeing humans from a
particular chore or problem.


1167
1:7:1,97 --> 1:7:4,6
Imagine what your life
would be like today


1168
1:7:4,6 --> 1:7:6,9
without a telephone, or an oven


1169
1:7:6,9 --> 1:7:9,6
or a computer, or an airplane.


1170
1:7:9,6 --> 1:7:9,64
.


1171
1:7:9,64 --> 1:7:12,375
And, everything in your home,
which you take for granted


1172
1:7:12,375 --> 1:7:14,415
from a doorbell, to a table


1173
1:7:14,415 --> 1:7:17,58
to a dishwasher, is technology


1174
1:7:17,58 --> 1:7:23,4
generated from the creative scientific
ingenuity of human technicians.


1175
1:7:23,4 --> 1:7:26,69
Not money, politics or religion.


1176
1:7:26,69 --> 1:7:30,39
These are false institutions.


1177
1:7:30,39 --> 1:7:33,63
- ...and writing your
congressman is fantastic.


1178
1:7:33,63 --> 1:7:36,85
They tell you to write your congressman
if you want something done.


1179
1:7:36,85 --> 1:7:40,72
The men in Washington should be
at the forefront of technology.


1180
1:7:40,72 --> 1:7:42,74
The forefront of human study.


1181
1:7:42,74 --> 1:7:44,6
The forefront of crime.


1182
1:7:44,6 --> 1:7:47,4
All the factors that
shape human behavior.


1183
1:7:47,4 --> 1:7:49,4
You don't have to write
your congressman.


1184
1:7:49,4 --> 1:7:54,1
What kind of people are they that
are appointed to do that job?


1185
1:7:54,1 --> 1:7:57,1
The future will have
great difficulty...


1186
1:7:57,1 --> 1:8:0,66
and the question that's
raised by politicians is:


1187
1:8:0,66 --> 1:8:3,1
How much will a project cost?


1188
1:8:3,1 --> 1:8:6,1
The question is not "how
much will it cost".


1189
1:8:6,1 --> 1:8:8,5
Do we have the resources?


1190
1:8:8,5 --> 1:8:12,55
And we have the resources
today to house everyone,


1191
1:8:12,55 --> 1:8:15,34
build hospitals all
over the world,


1192
1:8:15,34 --> 1:8:17,54
build schools all over the world


1193
1:8:17,54 --> 1:8:22,96
the finest equipment in labs for
teaching and doing medical research.


1194
1:8:22,96 --> 1:8:27,37
So you see, we have all that,
but we're in a monetary system


1195
1:8:27,37 --> 1:8:32,15
and in a monetary
system there's profit.


1196
1:8:32,15 --> 1:8:35,915
-And what is the fundamental mechanism
that drives the profit system


1197
1:8:35,915 --> 1:8:37,92
besides self-interest?


1198
1:8:37,92 --> 1:8:41,87
What is it exactly that maintains
that competitive edge at its core?


1199
1:8:41,87 --> 1:8:45,56
Is it high efficiency
and sustainability?


1200
1:8:45,56 --> 1:8:48,888
No. That isn't part
of their design.


1201
1:8:48,888 --> 1:8:51,1
Nothing produced in our
profit based society


1202
1:8:51,1 --> 1:8:53,7
is even remotely
sustainable or efficient.


1203
1:8:53,7 --> 1:8:56,594
If it was, there wouldn't be a
multi-million dollar a year


1204
1:8:56,594 --> 1:8:58,9
service industry
for automobiles.


1205
1:8:58,9 --> 1:9:1,44
Nor would the average
lifespan for most electronics


1206
1:9:1,44 --> 1:9:5,5
be less than three months
before they're obsolete.


1207
1:9:5,5 --> 1:9:7,62
Is it abundance?


1208
1:9:7,62 --> 1:9:9,13
Absolutely not.


1209
1:9:9,13 --> 1:9:11,8
Abundance, as based on the
laws of supply and demand


1210
1:9:11,8 --> 1:9:14,0
is actually a negative thing.


1211
1:9:14,0 --> 1:9:15,63
If a diamond company finds


1212
1:9:15,63 --> 1:9:19,28
ten times the usual amount of
diamonds during their mining


1213
1:9:19,28 --> 1:9:21,57
it means the supply of
diamonds has increased


1214
1:9:21,57 --> 1:9:25,85
which means the cost and
profit per diamond drops.


1215
1:9:25,85 --> 1:9:29,7
The fact is: efficiency,
sustainability and abundance


1216
1:9:29,7 --> 1:9:31,945
are enemies of profit.


1217
1:9:31,945 --> 1:9:33,6
To put it into a word


1218
1:9:33,6 --> 1:9:41,0
it is the mechanism of scarcity
that increases profits.


1219
1:9:41,0 --> 1:9:42,8
-What is scarcity?


1220
1:9:42,8 --> 1:9:45,0
Based on keeping
products valuable.


1221
1:9:45,0 --> 1:9:48,95
Slowing up production on
oil raises the price.


1222
1:9:48,95 --> 1:9:52,685
Maintaining scarcity of
diamonds keeps the price high.


1223
1:9:52,685 --> 1:9:56,185
They burn diamonds at the
Kimberly Diamond Mine.


1224
1:9:56,185 --> 1:9:59,13
They are made of carbon.
That keeps the price up.


1225
1:9:59,13 --> 1:10:3,363
-So then, what does it mean
for society when scarcity


1226
1:10:3,363 --> 1:10:6,485
either produced naturally
or through manipulation


1227
1:10:6,485 --> 1:10:11,55
is a beneficial
condition for industry?


1228
1:10:11,55 --> 1:10:14,0
It means that sustainability
and abundance


1229
1:10:14,0 --> 1:10:17,574
will never ever occur
in a profit system


1230
1:10:17,574 --> 1:10:21,92
for it simply goes against the
very nature of the structure.


1231
1:10:21,92 --> 1:10:28,232
Therefore, it is impossible to have
a world without war or poverty.


1232
1:10:28,232 --> 1:10:31,765
It is impossible to continually
advance technology


1233
1:10:31,765 --> 1:10:35,102
to its most efficient
and productive states.


1234
1:10:35,102 --> 1:10:37,25
And, most dramatically


1235
1:10:37,25 --> 1:10:40,415
it is impossible to
expect human beings


1236
1:10:40,415 --> 1:10:45,913
to behave in truly
ethical or decent ways.


1237
1:10:45,913 --> 1:10:47,928
"Human nature


1238
1:10:47,928 --> 1:10:50,933
or human behavior? "


1239
1:10:50,933 --> 1:10:53,414
-People use the word instinct


1240
1:10:53,414 --> 1:10:57,5
because they can't account
for the behavior.


1241
1:10:57,5 --> 1:10:59,915
They sit back and they evaluate


1242
1:10:59,915 --> 1:11:2,775
with their lack of
knowledge, you know


1243
1:11:2,775 --> 1:11:5,22
and they say things like


1244
1:11:5,22 --> 1:11:8,415
"Humans are built a certain way.
Greed is a natural thing"


1245
1:11:8,415 --> 1:11:10,82
as though they'd worked
for years on it.


1246
1:11:10,82 --> 1:11:14,5
And it's no more natural
than wearing clothing.


1247
1:11:14,5 --> 1:11:17,42
-What we want to
do is to eliminate


1248
1:11:17,42 --> 1:11:19,9
the causes of the problems.


1249
1:11:19,9 --> 1:11:22,567
Eliminate the processes


1250
1:11:22,567 --> 1:11:26,7
that produce greed and
bigotry and prejudice


1251
1:11:26,7 --> 1:11:31,0
and people taking advantage
of one another and elitism


1252
1:11:31,0 --> 1:11:35,95
eliminating the need for
prisons and welfare.


1253
1:11:35,95 --> 1:11:37,65
We have always had
these problems


1254
1:11:37,65 --> 1:11:41,5
because we have always lived
within scarcity and barter


1255
1:11:41,5 --> 1:11:45,5
and monetary systems
that produce scarcity.


1256
1:11:45,5 --> 1:11:49,58
-If you eradicate the
conditions that generate


1257
1:11:49,58 --> 1:11:53,899
what you call socially offensive
behavior, it does not exist.


1258
1:11:53,899 --> 1:11:53,915
.


1259
1:11:53,915 --> 1:11:57,994
A guy says: "Well, isn't that in-born?
" No it's not.


1260
1:11:57,994 --> 1:11:58,5
.


1261
1:11:58,5 --> 1:12:1,185
-There is no human nature;
there's human behavior,


1262
1:12:1,185 --> 1:12:4,5
and that's always been
changed throughout history.


1263
1:12:4,5 --> 1:12:9,7
You're not born with bigotry and
greed and corruption and hatred.


1264
1:12:9,7 --> 1:12:13,8
You pick that up
within the society.


1265
1:12:13,8 --> 1:12:18,5
-War, poverty, corruption,
hunger, misery, human suffering


1266
1:12:18,5 --> 1:12:20,599
will not change in
a monetary system;


1267
1:12:20,599 --> 1:12:24,32
that is, there will be very
little significant change.


1268
1:12:24,32 --> 1:12:28,95
It's going to take the redesign
of our culture, our values


1269
1:12:28,95 --> 1:12:28,98
.


1270
1:12:28,98 --> 1:12:32,725
and it has to be related to the
carrying capacity of the earth


1271
1:12:32,725 --> 1:12:37,545
not some human opinion or
some politicians notions


1272
1:12:37,545 --> 1:12:39,76
of the way the world ought to be


1273
1:12:39,76 --> 1:12:45,362
or some religious notion of
the conduct of human affairs.


1274
1:12:45,362 --> 1:12:50,51
And that's what The
Venus Project is about.


1275
1:12:50,51 --> 1:12:53,2
The society that we're
about to talk about


1276
1:12:53,2 --> 1:12:58,36
is a society that is free of
all the old superstitions


1277
1:12:58,36 --> 1:13:3,321
incarceration, prisons,
police, cruelty and law.


1278
1:13:3,321 --> 1:13:5,17
All laws will disappear


1279
1:13:5,17 --> 1:13:9,423
and the professions will disappear,
that are no longer valid


1280
1:13:9,423 --> 1:13:13,12
such as stockbrokers,
bankers, advertising.


1281
1:13:13,12 --> 1:13:15,285
Gone! Forever!


1282
1:13:15,285 --> 1:13:20,54
Because it's no longer relevant.


1283
1:13:20,54 --> 1:13:23,5
-When we understand
that it is technology


1284
1:13:23,5 --> 1:13:24,999
devised by human ingenuity


1285
1:13:24,999 --> 1:13:28,35
which frees humanity and
increases our quality of life


1286
1:13:28,35 --> 1:13:32,132
we then realize that the most
important focus we can have


1287
1:13:32,132 --> 1:13:36,295
is on the intelligent management
of the earth's resources.


1288
1:13:36,295 --> 1:13:39,69
For it is from these natural
resources we gain the materials


1289
1:13:39,69 --> 1:13:44,88
to continue our path of prosperity.
Understanding this we then see


1290
1:13:44,88 --> 1:13:49,165
that money fundamentally exists
as a barrier to these resources


1291
1:13:49,165 --> 1:13:52,8
for virtually everything
has a financial cost.


1292
1:13:52,8 --> 1:13:55,948
And why do we need money
to obtain these resources?


1293
1:13:55,948 --> 1:14:0,6
Because of real or
assumed scarcity.


1294
1:14:0,6 --> 1:14:3,725
We don't usually pay
for air and tap water


1295
1:14:3,725 --> 1:14:5,67
because it is in
such high abundance,


1296
1:14:5,67 --> 1:14:8,34
selling it would be pointless.


1297
1:14:8,34 --> 1:14:11,35
So then, logically
speaking, if resources


1298
1:14:11,35 --> 1:14:15,4
and technologies applicable to
creating everything in our societies


1299
1:14:15,4 --> 1:14:19,63
such as houses, cities and
transportation, were in high enough


1300
1:14:19,63 --> 1:14:24,331
abundance, there would be
no reason to sell anything.


1301
1:14:24,331 --> 1:14:28,663
Likewise, if automation and machinery
was so technologically advanced


1302
1:14:28,663 --> 1:14:31,15
as to relieve human
beings of labor,


1303
1:14:31,15 --> 1:14:33,7
there would be no
reason to have a job.


1304
1:14:33,7 --> 1:14:36,143
And with these social
aspects taken care of,


1305
1:14:36,143 --> 1:14:40,2
there would be no reason
to have money at all.


1306
1:14:40,2 --> 1:14:42,9
So the ultimate
question remains:


1307
1:14:42,9 --> 1:14:45,73
Do we on Earth have
enough resources


1308
1:14:45,73 --> 1:14:47,64
and technological understanding


1309
1:14:47,64 --> 1:14:50,4
to create a society
of such abundance


1310
1:14:50,4 --> 1:14:54,115
that everything we have now could
be available without a price tag


1311
1:14:54,115 --> 1:14:58,527
and without the need for
submission through employment?


1312
1:14:58,527 --> 1:15:1,251
Yes, we do.


1313
1:15:1,251 --> 1:15:5,589
We have the resources and technology
to enable this at a minimum


1314
1:15:5,589 --> 1:15:5,59
.


1315
1:15:5,59 --> 1:15:9,438
along with the ability to raise
the standards of living so high


1316
1:15:9,438 --> 1:15:13,3
that people in the future will
look back at our civilization now


1317
1:15:13,3 --> 1:15:18,971
and gawk at how primitive and
immature our society was.


1318
1:15:18,971 --> 1:15:23,217
-What The Venus Project proposes
is an entirely different system


1319
1:15:23,217 --> 1:15:23,218
.


1320
1:15:23,218 --> 1:15:26,989
that's updated to
present day knowledge.


1321
1:15:26,989 --> 1:15:29,5
-We've never given
scientists the problem of


1322
1:15:29,5 --> 1:15:31,5
how do you design a
society which would


1323
1:15:31,5 --> 1:15:34,4
eliminate boring and
monotonous jobs


1324
1:15:34,4 --> 1:15:38,52
that would eliminate
accidents in transportation


1325
1:15:38,52 --> 1:15:41,803
that would enable people to
have a high standard of living


1326
1:15:41,803 --> 1:15:44,973
that would eliminate
poisons in our food


1327
1:15:44,973 --> 1:15:48,81
give us other sources of energy
that are clean and efficient.


1328
1:15:48,81 --> 1:15:51,98
We can do that out there.


1329
1:15:51,98 --> 1:15:56,18
[A resource-based economy.]


1330
1:15:56,18 --> 1:15:57,756
The major difference between a


1331
1:15:57,756 --> 1:16:0,81
Resource-Based Economy (RBE)
and a monetary system


1332
1:16:0,81 --> 1:16:5,793
is that a RBE is really concerned
with people and their well-being,


1333
1:16:5,793 --> 1:16:5,794
.


1334
1:16:5,794 --> 1:16:9,522
where the monetary system has
become so distorted that the


1335
1:16:9,522 --> 1:16:13,969
concerns of the people are really
secondary, if they're there at all.


1336
1:16:13,969 --> 1:16:18,3
The products that are turned out are
for how much money you can get.


1337
1:16:18,3 --> 1:16:20,57
If there is a problem
in society and


1338
1:16:20,57 --> 1:16:24,98
you can't earn money from solving
that problem, then it won't be done.


1339
1:16:24,98 --> 1:16:27,36
The Resource-Based
Economy is really


1340
1:16:27,36 --> 1:16:29,384
not close to anything
that's been tried.


1341
1:16:29,384 --> 1:16:32,562
And with all our technology
today we can create abundance.


1342
1:16:32,562 --> 1:16:35,49
It could be used to improve
everyone's lifestyle


1343
1:16:35,49 --> 1:16:38,78
abundance all over the world if
we use our technology wisely


1344
1:16:38,78 --> 1:16:40,88
and maintain the environment.


1345
1:16:40,88 --> 1:16:44,966
-It's a very different system and
it's very hard to talk about


1346
1:16:44,966 --> 1:16:44,967
.


1347
1:16:44,967 --> 1:16:48,17
because the public is not
that well enough informed


1348
1:16:48,17 --> 1:16:51,53
as to the state of technology.


1349
1:16:51,53 --> 1:16:55,978
[Energy]


1350
1:16:55,978 --> 1:16:59,581
At present, we don't have
to burn fossil fuels.


1351
1:16:59,581 --> 1:17:3,852
We don't have to use anything that
would contaminate the environment.


1352
1:17:3,852 --> 1:17:7,99
There are many sources
of energy available.


1353
1:17:7,99 --> 1:17:11,22
-Alternative energy solutions
pushed by the establishment


1354
1:17:11,22 --> 1:17:14,436
such as hydrogen, biomass
and even nuclear


1355
1:17:14,436 --> 1:17:17,68
are highly insufficient,
dangerous and exist only


1356
1:17:17,68 --> 1:17:21,37
to perpetuate the profit-structure
that industry has created.


1357
1:17:21,37 --> 1:17:24,973
When we look beyond the propaganda
and self-serving solutions


1358
1:17:24,973 --> 1:17:27,275
put forth by the
energy companies


1359
1:17:27,275 --> 1:17:29,845
we find a seemingly
endless stream


1360
1:17:29,845 --> 1:17:34,6
of clean, abundant and renewable
energy for generating power.


1361
1:17:34,6 --> 1:17:37,293
Solar and wind energy are
well known to the public


1362
1:17:37,293 --> 1:17:41,4
but the true potential of these
mediums remains unexpressed.


1363
1:17:41,4 --> 1:17:43,64
Solar energy, derived
from the sun


1364
1:17:43,64 --> 1:17:47,462
has such abundance that one
hour of light at high noon


1365
1:17:47,462 --> 1:17:51,967
contains more energy than what the
entire world consumes in a year.


1366
1:17:51,967 --> 1:17:55,971
If we could capture 1/100th
of a percent of this energy


1367
1:17:55,971 --> 1:17:59,99
the world would never have to
use oil, gas or anything else.


1368
1:17:59,99 --> 1:18:2,411
The question then,
is not availability


1369
1:18:2,411 --> 1:18:4,746
but the technology
to harness it.


1370
1:18:4,746 --> 1:18:6,982
And there are many
advanced mediums today


1371
1:18:6,982 --> 1:18:9,22
which could accomplish just that


1372
1:18:9,22 --> 1:18:13,27
if they were not hindered by the
need to compete for market share


1373
1:18:13,27 --> 1:18:16,992
with the established
energy power structures.


1374
1:18:16,992 --> 1:18:18,827
Then there's wind energy.


1375
1:18:18,827 --> 1:18:21,43
Wind energy has long
been denounced as weak


1376
1:18:21,43 --> 1:18:25,1
and due to being location
driven impractical.


1377
1:18:25,1 --> 1:18:26,968
This is simply not true.


1378
1:18:26,968 --> 1:18:30,1
The US Department of
Energy admitted in 2007


1379
1:18:30,1 --> 1:18:35,1
that if wind was fully harvested in
just three of America's 50 states


1380
1:18:35,1 --> 1:18:38,98
it could power the
entire nation.


1381
1:18:38,98 --> 1:18:41,226
And then there are the
rather unknown mediums


1382
1:18:41,226 --> 1:18:43,819
of tidal and wave power.


1383
1:18:43,819 --> 1:18:47,12
Tidal power is derived from
tidal shifts in the ocean.


1384
1:18:47,12 --> 1:18:51,3
Installing turbines which capture
this movement generates energy.


1385
1:18:51,3 --> 1:18:55,13
In the United Kingdom, 42 sites
are currently noted as available


1386
1:18:55,13 --> 1:18:59,161
forecasting that 34%
of all the UK's energy


1387
1:18:59,161 --> 1:19:3,15
could come from
tidal power alone.


1388
1:19:3,15 --> 1:19:5,456
Wave power, which
extracts energy


1389
1:19:5,456 --> 1:19:7,476
from the surface
motions of the ocean


1390
1:19:7,476 --> 1:19:10,158
is estimated to have
a global potential


1391
1:19:10,158 --> 1:19:13,45
of up to 80,000
terawatt-hours a year.


1392
1:19:13,45 --> 1:19:17,57
This means 50% of the entire
planet's energy usage


1393
1:19:17,57 --> 1:19:21,5
could be produced from
this medium alone.


1394
1:19:21,5 --> 1:19:23,951
Now, it is important
to point out that


1395
1:19:23,951 --> 1:19:26,93
tidal, wave, solar
and wind power


1396
1:19:26,93 --> 1:19:30,465
requires virtually no
preliminary energy to harness


1397
1:19:30,465 --> 1:19:35,971
unlike coal, oil, gas, biomass,
hydrogen and all the others.


1398
1:19:35,971 --> 1:19:38,318
In combination, these
four mediums alone


1399
1:19:38,318 --> 1:19:40,8
if efficiently harnessed
through technology


1400
1:19:40,8 --> 1:19:44,1
could power the world forever.


1401
1:19:44,1 --> 1:19:47,43
That being said, there
happens to be another form


1402
1:19:47,43 --> 1:19:50,85
of clean renewable energy,
which trumps them all.


1403
1:19:50,85 --> 1:19:53,421
Geothermal power.


1404
1:19:53,421 --> 1:19:56,95
Geothermal energy utilizes
what is called "heat mining"


1405
1:19:56,95 --> 1:19:59,42
which, through a simple
process using water


1406
1:19:59,42 --> 1:20:2,8
is able to generate massive
amounts of clean energy.


1407
1:20:2,8 --> 1:20:6,53
In 2006, an MIT report
on geothermal energy


1408
1:20:6,53 --> 1:20:11,57
found that 13,000 ZJ of power are
currently available in the earth


1409
1:20:11,57 --> 1:20:15,57
with the possibility of 2,000
ZJ being easily tappable


1410
1:20:15,57 --> 1:20:17,9
with improved technology.


1411
1:20:17,9 --> 1:20:21,0
The total energy consumption of
all the countries on the planet


1412
1:20:21,0 --> 1:20:23,68
is about half of a ZJ a year.


1413
1:20:23,68 --> 1:20:27,16
This means about 4000
years of planetary power


1414
1:20:27,16 --> 1:20:30,48
could be harnessed in
this medium alone.


1415
1:20:30,48 --> 1:20:32,993
And when we understand that
the earth's heat generation


1416
1:20:32,993 --> 1:20:36,624
is constantly renewed, this
energy is really limitless.


1417
1:20:36,624 --> 1:20:39,78
It could be used forever.


1418
1:20:39,78 --> 1:20:42,31
These energy sources
are only a few


1419
1:20:42,31 --> 1:20:44,5
of the clean renewable
mediums available


1420
1:20:44,5 --> 1:20:47,62
and as time goes on,
we will find more.


1421
1:20:47,62 --> 1:20:51,67
The grand realization is that
we have total energy abundance


1422
1:20:51,67 --> 1:20:53,43
without the need for pollution


1423
1:20:53,43 --> 1:20:59,77
traditional conservation
or, in fact, a price tag.


1424
1:20:59,77 --> 1:21:2,62
And what about transportation?


1425
1:21:2,62 --> 1:21:5,62
The prevailing means of
transportation in our societies


1426
1:21:5,62 --> 1:21:7,722
is by automobile and aircraft


1427
1:21:7,722 --> 1:21:11,36
both of which predominantly
need fossil fuels to run.


1428
1:21:11,36 --> 1:21:14,35
In the case of the automobile,
the battery technology


1429
1:21:14,35 --> 1:21:16,1
needed to power an electric car


1430
1:21:16,1 --> 1:21:18,0
that can go over a
hundred miles an hour


1431
1:21:18,0 --> 1:21:20,43
for over two hundred
miles on one charge


1432
1:21:20,43 --> 1:21:23,48
exists and has existed
for many years.


1433
1:21:23,48 --> 1:21:26,62
However, due to battery patents,
controlled by the oil industry


1434
1:21:26,62 --> 1:21:29,65
which limits their availability
to maintain market share


1435
1:21:29,65 --> 1:21:32,57
coupled with political pressure
from the energy industry


1436
1:21:32,57 --> 1:21:37,17
the accessibility and affordability
of this technology is limited.


1437
1:21:37,17 --> 1:21:38,792
There is absolutely no reason,


1438
1:21:38,792 --> 1:21:41,3
other than pure corrupt
profit interests


1439
1:21:41,3 --> 1:21:43,45
that every single
vehicle in the world


1440
1:21:43,45 --> 1:21:48,74
cannot be electric and utterly clean,
with zero need for gasoline.


1441
1:21:48,74 --> 1:21:51,3
As far as airplanes,
it is time we realize


1442
1:21:51,3 --> 1:21:54,49
that this means of travel
is inefficient, cumbersome


1443
1:21:54,49 --> 1:21:57,89
slow, and causes far
too much pollution.


1444
1:21:57,89 --> 1:22:0,13
This is a maglev train.


1445
1:22:0,13 --> 1:22:2,93
It uses magnets for propulsion.


1446
1:22:2,93 --> 1:22:5,62
It is fully suspended
by a magnetic field


1447
1:22:5,62 --> 1:22:10,24
and requires less than 2% of the
energy used for plane travel.


1448
1:22:10,24 --> 1:22:13,43
The train has no wheels,
so nothing can wear out.


1449
1:22:13,43 --> 1:22:17,12
The current maximum speed of
versions of this technology


1450
1:22:17,12 --> 1:22:21,55
as used in Japan, is three hundred
and sixty one miles per hour.


1451
1:22:21,55 --> 1:22:25,89
However this version of the
technology is very dated.


1452
1:22:25,89 --> 1:22:27,96
An organization called ET3


1453
1:22:27,96 --> 1:22:30,26
which has connections
with The Venus Project


1454
1:22:30,26 --> 1:22:33,13
has established a
tube-based maglev


1455
1:22:33,13 --> 1:22:36,39
that can travel up to
4000 miles per hour


1456
1:22:36,39 --> 1:22:38,93
in a motionless,
frictionless tube


1457
1:22:38,93 --> 1:22:42,19
which can go over
land or under water.


1458
1:22:42,19 --> 1:22:46,3
Imagine going from LA to New
York for an extended lunch break


1459
1:22:46,3 --> 1:22:50,55
or from Washington D.C.
to Beijing, China, in two hours.


1460
1:22:50,55 --> 1:22:54,7
This is the future of continental
and intercontinental travel.


1461
1:22:54,7 --> 1:22:58,649
Fast, clean, with only a
fraction of the energy usage


1462
1:22:58,649 --> 1:23:1,81
we use today for the same means.


1463
1:23:1,81 --> 1:23:4,13
In fact, between
maglev technology


1464
1:23:4,13 --> 1:23:7,89
advanced battery storage
and geothermal energy


1465
1:23:7,89 --> 1:23:11,42
there will be no reason to
ever burn fossil fuels again.


1466
1:23:11,42 --> 1:23:13,0
And we can do this now


1467
1:23:13,0 --> 1:23:17,7
if we were not held back by the
paralyzing profit structure.

toward fascism.


1470
1:23:24,46 --> 1:23:29,5
It has a propensity by its
dominant philosophy and religion


1471

to uphold the fascist
point of view.


1472

American industry is essentially
a fascist institution.

minute you punch that time clock


1474

make them ignorant.

the fact is, as technology grows


1493
1:24:38,46 --> 1:24:42,929
the need for humans in the work force
will continually be diminished.

1:24:42,93 --> 1:24:45,3
This creates a serious clash


1496
1:24:45,3 --> 1:24:50,48
which proves the falseness of
the monetary-based labor system


1497
1:24:50,48 --> 1:24:53,85
for human employment is
in direct competition


1498
1:24:53,85 --> 1:24:56,5
with technological development.


1499
1:24:56,5 --> 1:25:0,743
Therefore, given the fundamental
priority of profit by industry


1500
1:25:0,743 --> 1:25:3,647
people through time will
be continually laid off


1501
1:25:3,647 --> 1:25:6,38
and replaced by machines.


1502
1:25:6,38 --> 1:25:8,0
-When industry
takes on a machine


1503
1:25:8,0 --> 1:25:11,201
instead of shortening the
work day, they downsize.


1504
1:25:11,201 --> 1:25:15,69
You lose your job so you have
a right to fear machines.


1505
1:25:15,69 --> 1:25:19,8
-In a high technology,
resource-based economy


1506
1:25:19,8 --> 1:25:23,941
it is conservative to say that about
90% of all current occupations


1507
1:25:23,941 --> 1:25:26,191
could be phased out by machines.


1508
1:25:26,191 --> 1:25:29,909
Freeing humans to live their
life without servitude.


1509
1:25:29,909 --> 1:25:33,25
For this is the point
of technology itself.


1510
1:25:33,25 --> 1:25:35,7
And through time,
with nanotechnology


1511
1:25:35,7 --> 1:25:38,286
and other highly advanced
forms of science


1512
1:25:38,286 --> 1:25:43,144
it is not far fetched to see how
even complex medical procedures


1513
1:25:43,144 --> 1:25:45,913
could be performed
by machines as well.


1514
1:25:45,913 --> 1:25:49,55
And based on the pattern, with
much higher success rates


1515
1:25:49,55 --> 1:25:51,8
than humans get today.


1516
1:25:51,8 --> 1:25:55,41
The path is clear but our
monetary-based structure


1517
1:25:55,41 --> 1:25:59,507
which requires labor for
income, blocks this progress


1518
1:25:59,507 --> 1:26:3,3
for humans need jobs
in order to survive.


1519
1:26:3,3 --> 1:26:5,776
The bottom line is that
this system must go


1520
1:26:5,776 --> 1:26:7,8
or we will never be free


1521
1:26:7,8 --> 1:26:11,85
and technology will be
constantly paralyzed.


1522
1:26:11,85 --> 1:26:14,37
-We have machines
that clean out sewers


1523
1:26:14,37 --> 1:26:17,259
it frees a human being
from doing that.


1524
1:26:17,259 --> 1:26:23,447
So look at machines as
extensions of human performance.


1525
1:26:23,447 --> 1:26:26,325
-Furthermore, many
occupations today


1526
1:26:26,325 --> 1:26:31,0
will have simply no basis to exist
in a resource-based economy


1527
1:26:31,0 --> 1:26:34,423
such as anything associated
with the management of money


1528
1:26:34,423 --> 1:26:38,14
advertising, along with
the legal system itself.


1529
1:26:38,14 --> 1:26:41,526
For, without money, a great
majority of the crimes


1530
1:26:41,526 --> 1:26:44,271
that are committed today
would never occur.


1531
1:26:44,271 --> 1:26:46,631
Virtually all forms of
crime are a consequence


1532
1:26:46,631 --> 1:26:50,384
of the monetary system, either
directly or by neurosis


1533
1:26:50,384 --> 1:26:54,44
inflicted through
financial deprivation.


1534
1:26:54,44 --> 1:26:58,789
Therefore, laws themselves could
eventually become extinct.


1535
1:26:58,789 --> 1:27:2,0
-Instead of putting up a
sign "Drive carefully


1536
1:27:2,0 --> 1:27:5,18
slippery when wet," put
abrasive in the highway


1537
1:27:5,18 --> 1:27:7,18
so it is not slippery when wet.


1538
1:27:7,18 --> 1:27:9,48
And if a person gets
in car, they're drunk


1539
1:27:9,48 --> 1:27:11,507
and the car oscillates
a great deal


1540
1:27:11,507 --> 1:27:14,38
there's a little pendulum
that swings up and back


1541
1:27:14,38 --> 1:27:16,82
and that will pull the
car over to the side.


1542
1:27:16,82 --> 1:27:19,212
Not a law... solution.


1543
1:27:19,212 --> 1:27:19,23
.


1544
1:27:19,23 --> 1:27:23,438
Put sonar and radar on automobiles
so they can't hit one another.


1545
1:27:23,438 --> 1:27:25,893
Man-made laws are attempts


1546
1:27:25,893 --> 1:27:28,197
to deal with occurring problems


1547
1:27:28,197 --> 1:27:30,648
and not knowing
how to solve them


1548
1:27:30,648 --> 1:27:32,9
they make a law.


1549
1:27:32,9 --> 1:27:35,15
-In the United States,
the most privatized


1550
1:27:35,15 --> 1:27:39,3
capitalist country on the planet,
it should come as no surprise


1551
1:27:39,3 --> 1:27:43,151
that it also has the largest
prison population in the world


1552
1:27:43,151 --> 1:27:45,194
growing every year.


1553
1:27:45,194 --> 1:27:48,333
Statistically, most of these
people are uneducated


1554
1:27:48,333 --> 1:27:51,63
and come from poor,
deprived societies.


1555
1:27:51,63 --> 1:27:56,412
And, contrary to propaganda, it is
this environmental conditioning


1556
1:27:56,412 --> 1:27:59,999
which lures them into criminal
and violent behavior.


1557
1:27:59,999 --> 1:28:2,308
However society
looks the other way


1558
1:28:2,308 --> 1:28:4,2
in regard to this point.


1559
1:28:4,2 --> 1:28:8,113
The legal and prison systems
are just more examples


1560
1:28:8,113 --> 1:28:10,799
of how our society
avoids examining


1561
1:28:10,799 --> 1:28:13,203
the root causes of behaviour.


1562
1:28:13,203 --> 1:28:16,637
Billions are spent each
year on prisons and police


1563
1:28:16,637 --> 1:28:16,7
.


1564
1:28:16,7 --> 1:28:20,782
while only a fraction is spent
on programs for poverty


1565
1:28:20,782 --> 1:28:23,111
which is one of the most
fundamental variables


1566
1:28:23,111 --> 1:28:25,813
responsible for crime
to begin with.


1567
1:28:25,813 --> 1:28:28,433
And, as long as we have
an economic system


1568
1:28:28,433 --> 1:28:30,999
which prefers and
in fact creates


1569
1:28:30,999 --> 1:28:36,6
scarcity and deprivation,
crime will never go away.


1570
1:28:36,6 --> 1:28:40,7
[incentive]


1571
1:28:40,7 --> 1:28:45,15
-If people have access to
the necessities of life


1572
1:28:45,15 --> 1:28:51,0
without servitude,
debt, barter, trade


1573
1:28:51,0 --> 1:28:52,861
they behave very differently.


1574
1:28:52,861 --> 1:28:57,34
You want all these things
available without a price tag.


1575
1:28:57,34 --> 1:29:2,5
Now then, "you gotta have a price
tag, what will motivate people?


1576
1:29:2,5 --> 1:29:6,91
A man gets everything he wants,
he'd just lay around in the sun."


1577
1:29:6,91 --> 1:29:9,3
This is the myth
they perpetuate.


1578
1:29:9,3 --> 1:29:12,35
People in our culture
are trained to believe


1579
1:29:12,35 --> 1:29:15,6
that the monetary system
produces incentive.


1580
1:29:15,6 --> 1:29:19,3
If they have access to things, why
should they want to do anything?


1581
1:29:19,3 --> 1:29:20,838
They would lose their incentive.


1582
1:29:20,838 --> 1:29:24,36
That's what you're taught to
support the monetary system.


1583
1:29:24,36 --> 1:29:27,716
-When you take money
out of the scenario,


1584
1:29:27,716 --> 1:29:31,901
there would be different incentives,
very different incentives.


1585
1:29:31,901 --> 1:29:35,5
-When people have access to
the necessities of life,


1586
1:29:35,5 --> 1:29:36,65
their incentives change.


1587
1:29:36,65 --> 1:29:39,21
What about the moon
and the stars?


1588
1:29:39,21 --> 1:29:41,329
New incentives arise.


1589
1:29:41,329 --> 1:29:43,486
If you make a painting
that you enjoy


1590
1:29:43,486 --> 1:29:48,5
you will enjoy giving it to
other people, not selling it.


1591
1:29:48,5 --> 1:29:52,338
[education]


1592
1:29:52,338 --> 1:29:56,35
-I think most of the education that
I've seen today is essentially


1593
1:29:56,35 --> 1:29:58,76
producing a person for a job


1594
1:29:58,76 --> 1:30:1,5
It's very specialized.
They're not generalists.


1595
1:30:1,5 --> 1:30:4,65
People don't know a lot about
a lot of different subjects.


1596
1:30:4,65 --> 1:30:7,53
I don't think you could
get people to go to war


1597
1:30:7,53 --> 1:30:10,5
if they knew a lot
about a lot of things.


1598
1:30:10,5 --> 1:30:13,56
I think education is mostly rote


1599
1:30:13,56 --> 1:30:16,56
and they're not taught
how to solve problems.


1600
1:30:16,56 --> 1:30:21,24
They're not given the tools,
emotionally or within their own field


1601
1:30:21,24 --> 1:30:23,88
of how to do critical thinking.


1602
1:30:23,88 --> 1:30:27,12
In a resource-based economy, the
education would be very different.


1603
1:30:27,12 --> 1:30:31,3
-Our society's major concern
is mental development


1604
1:30:31,3 --> 1:30:35,999
and to motivate each person
to their highest potential.


1605
1:30:35,999 --> 1:30:36,0
.


1606
1:30:36,0 --> 1:30:40,36
Because our philosophy is; the smarter
people are, the richer the world


1607
1:30:40,36 --> 1:30:43,29
because everybody
becomes a contributor.


1608
1:30:43,29 --> 1:30:47,409
The smarter your kids are,
the better my life will be.


1609
1:30:47,409 --> 1:30:47,41
.


1610
1:30:47,41 --> 1:30:49,48
Because they'll be contributing
more constructively


1611
1:30:49,48 --> 1:30:52,23
to the environment
and to my life.


1612
1:30:52,23 --> 1:30:56,87
Because everything that we devise
within a resource based economy


1613
1:30:56,87 --> 1:30:59,999
would be applied to society, there
would be nothing to hold it back.


1614
1:30:59,999 --> 1:31:0,988
.


1615
1:31:0,988 --> 1:31:4,6
[civilization]


1616
1:31:4,6 --> 1:31:8,75
Patriotism, weapons,
armies, navies


1617
1:31:8,75 --> 1:31:13,199
all that is a sign that
we're not civilized yet.


1618
1:31:13,199 --> 1:31:13,2
.


1619
1:31:13,2 --> 1:31:14,98
Kids will ask their parents:


1620
1:31:14,98 --> 1:31:19,5
"Didn't you see the
necessity of the machines?


1621
1:31:19,5 --> 1:31:22,5
Dad, couldn't you see
that war was inevitable


1622
1:31:22,5 --> 1:31:25,37
when you produce scarcity?
Isn't it obvious?


1623
1:31:25,37 --> 1:31:28,529
Of course, the kid will understand
that you were pinheads,


1624
1:31:28,529 --> 1:31:28,53
.


1625
1:31:28,53 --> 1:31:32,74
raised merely to serve the
established institutions.


1626
1:31:32,74 --> 1:31:35,74
We're such an abominable,
sick society


1627
1:31:35,74 --> 1:31:37,8
that we won't make
the history book.


1628
1:31:37,8 --> 1:31:41,95
They'll just say that large nations
took land from smaller nations


1629
1:31:41,95 --> 1:31:43,6
used force and violence.


1630
1:31:43,6 --> 1:31:47,23
You'll get history talked
about as corrupt behavior


1631
1:31:47,23 --> 1:31:50,659
all the way along until the
beginning of the civilized world.


1632
1:31:50,659 --> 1:31:50,66
.


1633
1:31:50,66 --> 1:31:53,66
That's when all the
nations work together.


1634
1:31:53,66 --> 1:31:57,53
World unification, working
toward common good


1635
1:31:57,53 --> 1:31:59,645
for all human beings


1636
1:31:59,645 --> 1:32:4,15
and without anyone being
subservient to anyone else.


1637
1:32:4,15 --> 1:32:8,889
Without social stratification,
whether it be technical elitism


1638
1:32:8,889 --> 1:32:8,89
.


1639
1:32:8,89 --> 1:32:13,719
or any other kind of elitism,
eradicated from the face of the Earth.


1640
1:32:13,719 --> 1:32:13,72
.


1641
1:32:13,72 --> 1:32:18,13
The "state" does nothing
because there is no "state".


1642
1:32:18,13 --> 1:32:22,6
Because there is no state...


1643
1:32:22,6 --> 1:32:26,73
The system I advocate, a
resource based global economy


1644
1:32:26,73 --> 1:32:30,549
is not perfect, it's just a
lot better than what we have.


1645
1:32:30,549 --> 1:32:30,55
.


1646
1:32:30,55 --> 1:32:41,65
We can never achieve perfection.


1647
1:32:41,65 --> 1:32:47,499
"My country is the world...
and my religion is to do good."


1648
1:32:47,499 --> 1:32:47,5
.


1649
1:32:47,5 --> 1:32:51,23
- Thomas Paine - 1737-1809


1650
1:32:51,23 --> 1:32:53,3
-The social values
of our society


1651
1:32:53,3 --> 1:32:56,489
which has manifested in
perpetual warfare, corruption


1652
1:32:56,489 --> 1:32:56,49
.


1653
1:32:56,49 --> 1:33:1,348
oppressive laws, social stratification,
irrelevant superstitions


1654
1:33:1,348 --> 1:33:1,349
.


1655
1:33:1,349 --> 1:33:1,35
.


1656
1:33:1,35 --> 1:33:4,9
environmental destruction,
and a despotic


1657
1:33:4,9 --> 1:33:8,76
socially indifferent, profit
oriented ruling class


1658
1:33:8,76 --> 1:33:11,95
is fundamentally the result
of a collective ignorance


1659
1:33:11,95 --> 1:33:16,7
of two of the most basic insights
humans can have about reality.


1660
1:33:16,7 --> 1:33:21,93
The emergent and symbiotic
aspects of natural law.


1661
1:33:21,93 --> 1:33:25,55
The emergent nature of
reality is that all systems


1662
1:33:25,55 --> 1:33:29,2
whether it is knowledge,
society, technology


1663
1:33:29,2 --> 1:33:32,19
philosophy or any other creation


1664
1:33:32,19 --> 1:33:37,159
will, when uninhibited, undergo
fluid perpetual change.


1665
1:33:37,159 --> 1:33:37,16
.


1666
1:33:37,16 --> 1:33:39,27
What we consider
commonplace today


1667
1:33:39,27 --> 1:33:42,64
such as modern communication
and transportation


1668
1:33:42,64 --> 1:33:46,22
would have been unimaginable
in ancient times.


1669
1:33:46,22 --> 1:33:49,17
Likewise, the future will
contain technologies


1670
1:33:49,17 --> 1:33:51,74
realizations and
social structures


1671
1:33:51,74 --> 1:33:54,97
that we cannot even
fathom in the present.


1672
1:33:54,97 --> 1:33:57,83
We have gone from
alchemy to chemistry


1673
1:33:57,83 --> 1:34:1,14
from a geocentric universe
to a heliocentric


1674
1:34:1,14 --> 1:34:4,33
from believing that demons
were the cause of illness


1675
1:34:4,33 --> 1:34:6,42
to modern medicine.


1676
1:34:6,42 --> 1:34:9,13
This development shows
no sign of ending


1677
1:34:9,13 --> 1:34:12,84
and it is this awareness
that aligns us and leads us


1678
1:34:12,84 --> 1:34:17,99
on a continuous path to
growth and progress.


1679
1:34:17,99 --> 1:34:17,1
.


1680
1:34:17,1 --> 1:34:20,39
Static, empirical
knowledge does not exist


1681
1:34:20,39 --> 1:34:24,35
rather it is the insight of
the emergence of all systems


1682
1:34:24,35 --> 1:34:26,82
we must recognize.


1683
1:34:26,82 --> 1:34:30,79
This means we must be open to
new information at all times


1684
1:34:30,79 --> 1:34:33,5
even if it threatens our
current belief system


1685
1:34:33,5 --> 1:34:36,12
and hence, identities.


1686
1:34:36,12 --> 1:34:39,85
Sadly, society today has
failed to recognize this


1687
1:34:39,85 --> 1:34:43,46
and the established institutions
continue to paralyze growth


1688
1:34:43,46 --> 1:34:47,0
by preserving outdated
social structures.


1689
1:34:47,0 --> 1:34:51,0
Simultaneously, the population
suffers from a fear of change.


1690
1:34:51,0 --> 1:34:54,3
For their conditioning
assumes a static identity


1691
1:34:54,3 --> 1:34:56,26
and challenging
one's belief system


1692
1:34:56,26 --> 1:34:59,86
usually results in
insult and apprehension.


1693
1:34:59,86 --> 1:35:5,45
For being wrong is erroneously
associated with failure.


1694
1:35:5,45 --> 1:35:9,19
When in fact to be proven
wrong should be celebrated.


1695
1:35:9,19 --> 1:35:13,0
For it is elevating someone to
a new level of understanding,


1696
1:35:13,0 --> 1:35:15,309
furthering awareness.


1697
1:35:15,309 --> 1:35:19,85
The fact is, there is no such
thing as a smart human being


1698
1:35:19,85 --> 1:35:21,82
for it is merely
a matter of time


1699
1:35:21,82 --> 1:35:26,687
before their ideas are updated,
changed or eradicated.


1700
1:35:26,687 --> 1:35:30,46
And this tendency to blindly
hold on to a belief system,


1701
1:35:30,46 --> 1:35:34,495
sheltering it from new, possibly
transforming information


1702
1:35:34,495 --> 1:35:39,834
is nothing less than a form
of intellectual materialism.


1703
1:35:39,834 --> 1:35:42,97
The monetary system
perpetuates this materialism


1704
1:35:42,97 --> 1:35:45,673
not only by its
self-preserving structures


1705
1:35:45,673 --> 1:35:48,38
but also through the
countless number of people


1706
1:35:48,38 --> 1:35:50,38
who have been conditioned
into blindly


1707
1:35:50,38 --> 1:35:52,78
and thoughtlessly upholding
these structures


1708
1:35:52,78 --> 1:35:57,985
therefore becoming self-appointed
guardians of the status quo.


1709
1:35:57,985 --> 1:36:1,989
Sheep which no longer need a
sheep-dog to control them.


1710
1:36:1,989 --> 1:36:4,49
For they control each other


1711
1:36:4,49 --> 1:36:7,995
by ostracizing those who
step out of the norm.


1712
1:36:7,995 --> 1:36:11,631
This tendency to resist change
and uphold existing institutions


1713
1:36:11,631 --> 1:36:11,632
.


1714
1:36:11,632 --> 1:36:15,7
for the sake of identity,
comfort, power and profit


1715
1:36:15,7 --> 1:36:15,83
.


1716
1:36:15,83 --> 1:36:18,1
is completely unsustainable


1717
1:36:18,1 --> 1:36:20,508
and will only produce
further imbalance


1718
1:36:20,508 --> 1:36:23,976
fragmentation, distortion,
and invariably


1719
1:36:23,976 --> 1:36:23,977
.


1720
1:36:23,977 --> 1:36:23,978
.


1721
1:36:23,978 --> 1:36:27,515
destruction.


1722
1:36:27,515 --> 1:36:30,251
It's time to change.


1723
1:36:30,251 --> 1:36:32,1
From hunters and gatherers


1724
1:36:32,1 --> 1:36:34,1
to the agricultural revolution


1725
1:36:34,1 --> 1:36:36,0
to the industrial revolution


1726
1:36:36,0 --> 1:36:37,57
the pattern is clear.


1727
1:36:37,57 --> 1:36:39,994
It is time for a
new social system


1728
1:36:39,994 --> 1:36:44,17
which reflects the
understandings we have today.


1729
1:36:44,17 --> 1:36:47,99
The monetary system is a
product of a period of time


1730
1:36:47,99 --> 1:36:47,1
.


1731
1:36:47,1 --> 1:36:49,55
where scarcity was a reality.


1732
1:36:49,55 --> 1:36:54,289
Now, with the age of technology, it
is no longer relevant to society.


1733
1:36:54,289 --> 1:36:54,29
.


1734
1:36:54,29 --> 1:36:58,979
Gone with the aberrant
behavior it manifests.


1735
1:36:58,979 --> 1:37:3,5
Likewise, dominant world views,
such as theistic religion


1736
1:37:3,5 --> 1:37:6,809
operate with the same
social irrelevancy.


1737
1:37:6,809 --> 1:37:6,81
.


1738
1:37:6,81 --> 1:37:11,98
Islam, Christianity, Judaism,
Hinduism and all of the others


1739
1:37:11,98 --> 1:37:15,9
exist as barriers to
personal and social growth.


1740
1:37:15,9 --> 1:37:19,967
For each group perpetuates
a closed world view.


1741
1:37:19,967 --> 1:37:22,97
And this finite understanding
that they acknowledge


1742
1:37:22,97 --> 1:37:28,94
is simply not possible
in an emergent universe.


1743
1:37:28,94 --> 1:37:31,52
Yet, religion has succeeded in


1744
1:37:31,52 --> 1:37:33,981
shutting down the awareness
of this emergence


1745
1:37:33,981 --> 1:37:38,959
by instilling the psychological
distortion of faith upon its followers.


1746
1:37:38,959 --> 1:37:38,96
.


1747
1:37:38,96 --> 1:37:41,82
Where logic and new
information is rejected


1748
1:37:41,82 --> 1:37:46,5
in favor of traditionalized
outdated beliefs.


1749
1:37:46,5 --> 1:37:48,25
-The concept of God


1750
1:37:48,25 --> 1:37:52,4
is really a method of accounting
for the nature of things.


1751
1:37:52,4 --> 1:37:55,35
In the early days people
didn't know enough


1752
1:37:55,35 --> 1:37:56,93
about how things formed,


1753
1:37:56,93 --> 1:37:58,555
how nature worked.


1754
1:37:58,555 --> 1:38:1,75
So they invented their
own little stories


1755
1:38:1,75 --> 1:38:6,12
and they made god
in their own image.


1756
1:38:6,12 --> 1:38:8,5
A guy that gets angry


1757
1:38:8,5 --> 1:38:12,986
when people don't behave right,
he creates floods and earthquakes


1758
1:38:12,986 --> 1:38:13,15
.


1759
1:38:13,15 --> 1:38:16,95
and they say it's an act of God.


1760
1:38:16,95 --> 1:38:19,493
-A cursory glance at the
suppressed history of religion


1761
1:38:19,493 --> 1:38:22,62
reveals that even the
foundational myths themselves


1762
1:38:22,62 --> 1:38:27,34
are emergent culminations developed
through influence over time.


1763
1:38:27,34 --> 1:38:30,5
For example, a cardinal
doctrine of the Christian faith


1764
1:38:30,5 --> 1:38:32,973
is the death and
resurrection of Christ.


1765
1:38:32,973 --> 1:38:36,877
This notion is so important
that the Bible itself states


1766
1:38:36,877 --> 1:38:38,929
'And if Christ be not risen


1767
1:38:38,929 --> 1:38:44,618
then is our preaching vain and
your faith is also vain'.


1768
1:38:44,618 --> 1:38:47,988
Yet it is very difficult to
take this account literally


1769
1:38:47,988 --> 1:38:50,4
for not only is there
no primary source


1770
1:38:50,4 --> 1:38:53,627
denoting this supernatural
event in secular history


1771
1:38:53,627 --> 1:38:56,997
awareness of the enormous
number of pre-Christian saviors


1772
1:38:56,997 --> 1:38:59,667
who also died and
were resurrected


1773
1:38:59,667 --> 1:39:4,972
immediately puts this story in
mythological territory by association.


1774
1:39:4,972 --> 1:39:7,449
Early church figures,
such as Tertullian


1775
1:39:7,449 --> 1:39:7,45
.


1776
1:39:7,45 --> 1:39:10,5
went to great lengths to
break these associations


1777
1:39:10,5 --> 1:39:15,0
even claiming that the devil
caused the similarities to occur.


1778
1:39:15,0 --> 1:39:16,684
Stating in the second century:


1779
1:39:16,684 --> 1:39:19,486
"The devil, whose business
is to pervert the truth


1780
1:39:19,486 --> 1:39:22,99
mimics the exact circumstance
of the Divine Sacraments.


1781
1:39:22,99 --> 1:39:26,994
He baptizes his believers and
promises forgiveness of sins


1782
1:39:26,994 --> 1:39:29,241
he celebrates the
oblation of bread


1783
1:39:29,241 --> 1:39:31,99
and brings in the symbol
of the resurrection.


1784
1:39:31,99 --> 1:39:35,36
Let us therefore acknowledge
the craftiness of the devil


1785
1:39:35,36 --> 1:39:39,974
who copied certain things
of those that be Divine."


1786
1:39:39,974 --> 1:39:41,9
What is truly sad however


1787
1:39:41,9 --> 1:39:45,54
is that when we cease the idea
that the stories from Christianity


1788
1:39:45,54 --> 1:39:47,982
Judaism, Islam and
all the others


1789
1:39:47,982 --> 1:39:50,34
are literal history


1790
1:39:50,34 --> 1:39:52,76
and accept them for
what they really are


1791
1:39:52,76 --> 1:39:57,66
which are purely allegorical
expressions derived from many faiths


1792
1:39:57,66 --> 1:40:1,22
we see that all religions
share a common thread.


1793
1:40:1,22 --> 1:40:3,62
And it is this
unifying imperative


1794
1:40:3,62 --> 1:40:8,6
that needs to be recognized
and appreciated.


1795
1:40:8,6 --> 1:40:12,18
Religious belief has caused
more fragmentation and conflict


1796
1:40:12,18 --> 1:40:14,25
than any other ideology.


1797
1:40:14,25 --> 1:40:20,43
Christianity alone has
34,000 different subgroups.


1798
1:40:20,43 --> 1:40:23,53
-The Bible is subject
to interpretation.


1799
1:40:23,53 --> 1:40:25,22
When you read it, you say


1800
1:40:25,22 --> 1:40:28,84
"I think Jesus meant this.
I think Job meant that.


1801
1:40:28,84 --> 1:40:30,92
Oh No! He meant this."


1802
1:40:30,92 --> 1:40:35,5
So you have the Lutheran, the
Seventh-day Adventist, the Catholic


1803
1:40:35,5 --> 1:40:38,909
and a church divided
is no church at all.


1804
1:40:38,909 --> 1:40:45,4
And a church divided,
is no church at all.


1805
1:40:45,4 --> 1:40:47,64
And this point on division


1806
1:40:47,64 --> 1:40:51,23
which is a trademark of
all theistic religions,


1807
1:40:51,23 --> 1:40:54,5
brings us to our second
failure of awareness.


1808
1:40:54,5 --> 1:40:56,34
The false assumption
of separation


1809
1:40:56,34 --> 1:41:2,36
through the rejection of the
symbiotic relationship of life.


1810
1:41:2,36 --> 1:41:6,46
Apart from the understanding that
all natural systems are emergent


1811
1:41:6,46 --> 1:41:9,6
where all notions of reality
will be constantly developed


1812
1:41:9,6 --> 1:41:12,12
altered and even eradicated


1813
1:41:12,12 --> 1:41:15,873
we must also understand that
all systems are, in fact


1814
1:41:15,873 --> 1:41:20,61
invented fragments, merely for
the sake of conversation.


1815
1:41:20,61 --> 1:41:24,63
For there is no such thing
as independence in nature.


1816
1:41:24,63 --> 1:41:29,35
The whole of nature is a unified
system of interdependent variables


1817
1:41:29,35 --> 1:41:36,15
each a cause and a reaction, existing
only as a concentrated whole.


1818
1:41:36,15 --> 1:41:39,3
-You don't see the plug
connected to the environment


1819
1:41:39,3 --> 1:41:42,83
so it looks like we're
free, wandering around.


1820
1:41:42,83 --> 1:41:45,6
Take the oxygen away,
we all die immediately.


1821
1:41:45,6 --> 1:41:48,26
Take plant life away, we die.


1822
1:41:48,26 --> 1:41:50,85
And without the sun,
all the plants die.


1823
1:41:50,85 --> 1:41:52,612
So we are connected.


1824
1:41:52,612 --> 1:41:55,515
-We really must take into
account the totality.


1825
1:41:55,515 --> 1:41:58,18
This isn't just a human
experience on this planet,


1826
1:41:58,18 --> 1:41:59,454
this is a total experience.


1827
1:41:59,454 --> 1:42:1,9
And we know we can't survive
without plants and animals.


1828
1:42:1,9 --> 1:42:4,59
We know we can't survive without
the four elements, you know?


1829
1:42:4,59 --> 1:42:8,8
And so, when are we gonna really
start taking that into account?


1830
1:42:8,8 --> 1:42:10,63
That's what it is
to be successful.


1831
1:42:10,63 --> 1:42:15,64
Success depends on how well we
relate to everything around us.


1832
1:42:15,64 --> 1:42:17,714
I'm very aware of the
fact that my grandson


1833
1:42:17,714 --> 1:42:22,15
cannot possibly hope to
inherit a sustainable


1834
1:42:22,15 --> 1:42:22,76
.


1835
1:42:22,76 --> 1:42:24,35
peaceful, stable,
socially just world


1836
1:42:24,35 --> 1:42:26,804
unless every child
today growing up in


1837
1:42:26,804 --> 1:42:31,4
Ethiopia, in Indonesia, in
Bolivia, in Palestine, in Israel


1838
1:42:31,4 --> 1:42:34,266
also has that same expectation.


1839
1:42:34,266 --> 1:42:36,565
You've got to take care
of the whole community


1840
1:42:36,565 --> 1:42:38,838
or you're gonna have
serious problems.


1841
1:42:38,838 --> 1:42:42,908
And now we have to see that the
whole world is the community.


1842
1:42:42,908 --> 1:42:46,25
And we must all take care
of each other that way.


1843
1:42:46,25 --> 1:42:48,36
And it's not just a
community of human beings


1844
1:42:48,36 --> 1:42:51,455
it's a community of plants
and animals and elements.


1845
1:42:51,455 --> 1:42:54,45
And we really need
to understand that.


1846
1:42:54,45 --> 1:42:56,989
That's what's gonna bring
us joy too, and pleasure.


1847
1:42:56,989 --> 1:42:56,999
.


1848
1:42:56,999 --> 1:42:59,124
That's what's missing
in our lives right now.


1849
1:42:59,124 --> 1:43:2,415
We can call it spirituality,
but the fact of the matter is


1850
1:43:2,415 --> 1:43:2,5
.


1851
1:43:2,5 --> 1:43:6,75
joy comes from that
bliss of connectedness.


1852
1:43:6,75 --> 1:43:9,724
That's our god spirit, that's
that side of ourselves


1853
1:43:9,724 --> 1:43:13,424
that really feels it, and you
can feel it deep inside you.


1854
1:43:13,424 --> 1:43:16,477
It's this amazing wonderful feeling,
and you know it when you get it.


1855
1:43:16,477 --> 1:43:16,478
.


1856
1:43:16,478 --> 1:43:16,48
.


1857
1:43:16,48 --> 1:43:22,455
You don't get it from money,
you get it from connection.


1858
1:43:22,455 --> 1:43:22,456
.


1859
1:43:22,456 --> 1:43:26,694
-Now if that isn't a
hazard to this country.


1860
1:43:26,694 --> 1:43:28,76
How are we gonna keep
building nuclear weapons


1861
1:43:28,76 --> 1:43:31,134
you know what I mean?


1862
1:43:31,134 --> 1:43:33,76
What's gonna happen
to the arms industry


1863
1:43:33,76 --> 1:43:36,51
when we realize we're all one?


1864
1:43:36,51 --> 1:43:38,92
It's gonna fuck up the economy.


1865
1:43:38,92 --> 1:43:49,423
The economy that's fake anyway.


1866
1:43:49,423 --> 1:43:51,65
Which would be a real bummer.


1867
1:43:51,65 --> 1:43:57,74
You can see why the
government's crackin' down...


1868
1:43:57,74 --> 1:44:1,15
...on the idea of experiencing
unconditional love."


1869
1:44:1,15 --> 1:44:3,8
"I believe that unarmed truth
and unconditional love


1870
1:44:3,8 --> 1:44:7,0
will have the final
word in reality."


1871
1:44:7,0 --> 1:44:11,4
- Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
- 1929-1968


1872
1:44:11,4 --> 1:44:15,3
-Once we understand that the
integrity of our personal existences


1873
1:44:15,3 --> 1:44:17,8
are completely dependent
on the integrity


1874
1:44:17,8 --> 1:44:20,202
of everything else in our world


1875
1:44:20,202 --> 1:44:25,0
we have truly understood the
meaning of unconditional love.


1876
1:44:25,0 --> 1:44:29,0
For love is extensionality
and seeing everything as you


1877
1:44:29,0 --> 1:44:32,568
and you as everything can
have no conditionalities


1878
1:44:32,568 --> 1:44:36,55
for in fact, we are all
everything at once.


1879
1:44:36,55 --> 1:44:39,85
-If it's true that we're all
from the center of a star


1880
1:44:39,85 --> 1:44:41,0
every atom in each of us
from the center of a star


1881
1:44:41,0 --> 1:44:43,0
then we're all the same thing.


1882
1:44:43,0 --> 1:44:45,92
Even a Coke machine or a cigarette
butt in the street in Buffalo


1883
1:44:45,92 --> 1:44:47,95
is made out of atoms
that came from a star.


1884
1:44:47,95 --> 1:44:49,9
They've all been recycled
thousands of times


1885
1:44:49,9 --> 1:44:54,662
as have you and I.
And therefore, it's only me out there.


1886
1:44:54,662 --> 1:44:56,35
So what is there
to be afraid of?


1887
1:44:56,35 --> 1:44:58,364
What is there that
needs solace seeking?


1888
1:44:58,364 --> 1:45:1,83
Nothing. There's nothing to be
afraid of because it's all us.


1889
1:45:1,83 --> 1:45:4,83
The trouble is we have been
separated by being born


1890
1:45:4,83 --> 1:45:7,5
and given a name and an identity
and being individuated.


1891
1:45:7,5 --> 1:45:10,239
We've been separated from the oneness
and that's what religion exploits.


1892
1:45:10,239 --> 1:45:10,24
.


1893
1:45:10,24 --> 1:45:14,19
That people have this yearning to
be part of the overall one again.


1894
1:45:14,19 --> 1:45:17,7
So they exploit that.
They call it god, they say he has rules


1895
1:45:17,7 --> 1:45:19,4
and I think it's cruel.


1896
1:45:19,4 --> 1:45:22,2
I think you can do
it absent religion.


1897
1:45:22,2 --> 1:45:26,0
"An extraterrestrial visitor examining
the differences among human societies


1898
1:45:26,0 --> 1:45:29,1
would find those differences trivial
compared to the similarities


1899
1:45:29,1 --> 1:45:32,7
Our lives, our past and our future are
tied to the sun, the moon and the stars...


1900
1:45:32,7 --> 1:45:37,399
We humans have seen the atoms which constitute all
of nature and the forces that sculpted this work...


1901
1:45:37,399 --> 1:45:37,4
.


1902
1:45:37,4 --> 1:45:41,5
And we, we who embody the local eyes and ears
and thoughts and feelings of the cosmos,


1903
1:45:41,5 --> 1:45:45,499
we have begun at least to wonder about our origins...
star stuff contemplating the stars


1904
1:45:45,499 --> 1:45:45,5
.


1905
1:45:45,5 --> 1:45:48,5
organized collections of ten
billion billion billion atoms,


1906
1:45:48,5 --> 1:45:51,6
contemplating the evolution of
nature, tracing that long path


1907
1:45:51,6 --> 1:45:54,7
by which it arrived at consciousness
here on the planet earth...


1908
1:45:54,7 --> 1:45:57,8
Our loyalties are to the
species and to the planet.


1909
1:45:57,8 --> 1:46:0,9
Our obligation to survive and flourish
is owed not just to ourselves


1910
1:46:0,9 --> 1:46:4,0
but also to that cosmos ancient
and vast from which we spring.


1911
1:46:4,0 --> 1:46:7,0
We are one species.
We are star stuff harvesting star light.


1912
1:46:7,0 --> 1:46:9,429
- Carl Sagan - 1934-1996


1913
1:46:9,429 --> 1:46:11,565
-It's time to claim the unity


1914
1:46:11,565 --> 1:46:14,9
our outmoded social
systems have broken apart


1915
1:46:14,9 --> 1:46:18,99
and work together to create a
sustainable, global society


1916
1:46:18,99 --> 1:46:23,337
where everyone is taken care
of and everyone is truly free.


1917
1:46:23,337 --> 1:46:23,343
.


1918
1:46:23,343 --> 1:46:25,979
Your personal beliefs,
whatever they may be


1919
1:46:25,979 --> 1:46:29,649
are meaningless when it comes
to the necessities of life.


1920
1:46:29,649 --> 1:46:31,7
Every human being is born naked


1921
1:46:31,7 --> 1:46:35,27
needing warmth, food,
water, shelter.


1922
1:46:35,27 --> 1:46:37,45
Everything else is auxiliary.


1923
1:46:37,45 --> 1:46:39,993
Therefore, the most
important issue at hand


1924
1:46:39,993 --> 1:46:43,997
is the intelligent management
of the Earth's resources.


1925
1:46:43,997 --> 1:46:46,967
This can never be accomplished
in a monetary system


1926
1:46:46,967 --> 1:46:50,24
for the pursuit of profit is
the pursuit of self interest


1927
1:46:50,24 --> 1:46:53,974
and therefore imbalance
is inherent.


1928
1:46:53,974 --> 1:46:57,14
Simultaneously,
politicians are useless


1929
1:46:57,14 --> 1:47:1,982
for our true problems in life
are technical not political.


1930
1:47:1,982 --> 1:47:4,985
Furthermore, ideologies
that separate humanity


1931
1:47:4,985 --> 1:47:5,12
.


1932
1:47:5,12 --> 1:47:8,53
such as religion, need strong
reflection in the community


1933
1:47:8,53 --> 1:47:12,95
in regard to its value,
purpose and social relevancy.


1934
1:47:12,95 --> 1:47:14,461
Hopefully, through time


1935
1:47:14,461 --> 1:47:18,14
religion will lose its materialism
and basis in superstition


1936
1:47:18,14 --> 1:47:21,735
and move into the useful
field of philosophy.


1937
1:47:21,735 --> 1:47:24,738
The fact is, society
today is backwards


1938
1:47:24,738 --> 1:47:28,79
with politicians constantly talking
about protection and security


1939
1:47:28,79 --> 1:47:32,712
rather than creation,
unity and progress.


1940
1:47:32,712 --> 1:47:34,622
The US alone now spends about


1941
1:47:34,622 --> 1:47:37,984
$500 billion dollars
annually on defense.


1942
1:47:37,984 --> 1:47:41,179
That is enough to send every
high school senior in America


1943
1:47:41,179 --> 1:47:43,81
to a four year college.


1944
1:47:43,81 --> 1:47:46,1
In the 1940s the
Manhattan Project


1945
1:47:46,1 --> 1:47:49,69
produced the first true
weapon of mass destruction.


1946
1:47:49,69 --> 1:47:55,769
This program employed 130,000 people,
at an extreme financial cost.


1947
1:47:55,769 --> 1:48:0,11
Imagine what our life would be like
today if that group of scientists


1948
1:48:0,11 --> 1:48:3,1
instead of working on a
way of killing people


1949
1:48:3,1 --> 1:48:7,89
worked on a way to create a
self-sustaining abundant world.


1950
1:48:7,89 --> 1:48:13,899
Life today would be very, very
different if that was their goal.


1951
1:48:13,899 --> 1:48:13,987
.


1952
1:48:13,987 --> 1:48:16,456
Instead of weapons
of mass destruction


1953
1:48:16,456 --> 1:48:20,994
it is time to unleash
something much more powerful.


1954
1:48:20,994 --> 1:48:25,5
Weapons of Mass Creation (WMCs).


1955
1:48:25,5 --> 1:48:28,4
Our true divinity is in
our ability to create.


1956
1:48:28,4 --> 1:48:32,78
And armed with the understanding of
the symbiotic connections of life


1957
1:48:32,78 --> 1:48:36,376
while being guided by the
emergent nature of reality


1958
1:48:36,376 --> 1:48:41,448
there is nothing we
cannot do or accomplish.


1959
1:48:41,448 --> 1:48:43,984
Of course, we face
strong barriers


1960
1:48:43,984 --> 1:48:48,988
in the form of established power
structures that refuse to change.


1961
1:48:48,988 --> 1:48:48,989
.


1962
1:48:48,989 --> 1:48:51,625
At the heart of these structures
is the monetary system.


1963
1:48:51,625 --> 1:48:54,28
As explained earlier, the
fractional reserve policy


1964
1:48:54,28 --> 1:48:56,62
is a form of slavery
through debt


1965
1:48:56,62 --> 1:49:0,767
where it is literally impossible
for society to be free.


1966
1:49:0,767 --> 1:49:4,1
In turn, free market capitalism
in the form of free trade


1967
1:49:4,1 --> 1:49:7,474
uses debt to imprison the world
and manipulate countries


1968
1:49:7,474 --> 1:49:12,4
into subservience to a handful of
large business and political powers.


1969
1:49:12,4 --> 1:49:14,4
Apart from these
obvious amoralities


1970
1:49:14,4 --> 1:49:17,2
the system itself is
based on competition


1971
1:49:17,2 --> 1:49:19,92
which immediately
destroys the possibility


1972
1:49:19,92 --> 1:49:22,989
of large scale collaborations
for the common good.


1973
1:49:22,989 --> 1:49:29,14
Hence paralyzing any attempt
at true global sustainability.


1974
1:49:29,14 --> 1:49:33,2
These financial and corporate
structures are now obsolete


1975
1:49:33,2 --> 1:49:36,336
and they must be outgrown.


1976
1:49:36,336 --> 1:49:38,469
Of course, we can not be
naive enough to think that


1977
1:49:38,469 --> 1:49:41,374
the business and financial elite are
going to subscribe to this idea


1978
1:49:41,374 --> 1:49:43,543
for they will lose
power and control.


1979
1:49:43,543 --> 1:49:48,3
Therefore, peacefully yet highly
strategic action must be taken.


1980
1:49:48,3 --> 1:49:50,984
The most powerful course
of action is simple.


1981
1:49:50,984 --> 1:49:53,5
We have to alter our behavior


1982
1:49:53,5 --> 1:49:57,8
to force the power structure
to the will of the people.


1983
1:49:57,8 --> 1:50:1,9
We must stop
supporting the system.


1984
1:50:1,9 --> 1:50:4,14
The only way the
establishment will change


1985
1:50:4,14 --> 1:50:8,22
is by our refusal to participate
while continuously acknowledging


1986
1:50:8,22 --> 1:50:11,59
its endless flaws
and corruptions.


1987
1:50:11,59 --> 1:50:14,23
-They're not gonna give
up the monetary system


1988
1:50:14,23 --> 1:50:17,99
because of our designs
or what we recommend.


1989
1:50:17,99 --> 1:50:19,98
The system has to fail


1990
1:50:19,98 --> 1:50:24,97
and people have to lose confidence
in their elected leaders.


1991
1:50:24,97 --> 1:50:27,48
That will be a major
turning point


1992
1:50:27,48 --> 1:50:32,25
if The Venus Project is offered
as a possible alternative.


1993
1:50:32,25 --> 1:50:35,1
If not, I fear the consequences.


1994
1:50:35,1 --> 1:50:40,5
The trends now indicate that
our country is going bankrupt.


1995
1:50:40,5 --> 1:50:43,357
The probability is our
country will move


1996
1:50:43,357 --> 1:50:47,62
toward a military
dictatorship to prevent riots


1997
1:50:47,62 --> 1:50:50,2
and complete social breakdown.


1998
1:50:50,2 --> 1:50:53,12
Once the US breaks down,
all the other cultures


1999
1:50:53,12 --> 1:50:56,18
will undergo similar things.


2000
1:50:56,18 --> 1:50:58,48
-As of now, the world
financial system


2001
1:50:58,48 --> 1:51:2,37
is on the brink of collapse
due to its own shortcomings.


2002
1:51:2,37 --> 1:51:5,45
The controller of
currencies stated in 2003


2003
1:51:5,45 --> 1:51:7,86
that the interest on
the US national debt


2004
1:51:7,86 --> 1:51:11,9
will not be affordable
in less than ten years.


2005
1:51:11,9 --> 1:51:14,67
This theoretically means total
bankruptcy for the US economy


2006
1:51:14,67 --> 1:51:17,63
and its implications for
the world are immense.


2007
1:51:17,63 --> 1:51:20,37
In turn the fractional reserve
based monetary system


2008
1:51:20,37 --> 1:51:23,24
is reaching its theoretical
limits of expansion


2009
1:51:23,24 --> 1:51:27,47
and the banking failures you are
seeing are just the beginning.


2010
1:51:27,47 --> 1:51:31,679
This is why inflation is skyrocketing,
all debt is at record levels


2011
1:51:31,679 --> 1:51:31,68
.


2012
1:51:31,68 --> 1:51:34,29
and the government and FED
are hemorrhaging new money


2013
1:51:34,29 --> 1:51:36,67
to bailout the corrupt system.


2014
1:51:36,67 --> 1:51:38,71
For the only way to
keep the banks going


2015
1:51:38,71 --> 1:51:40,52
is by making more money.


2016
1:51:40,52 --> 1:51:44,639
The only way to make more money is
to create more debt and inflation.


2017
1:51:44,639 --> 1:51:44,64
.


2018
1:51:44,64 --> 1:51:47,827
It is simply a matter of
time before the tables turn


2019
1:51:47,827 --> 1:51:50,57
and there's no one is
willing to take new loans


2020
1:51:50,57 --> 1:51:52,95
while defaults grow
as people are unable


2021
1:51:52,95 --> 1:51:55,6
to afford their current loans.


2022
1:51:55,6 --> 1:51:57,23
Then the expansion
of money will stop


2023
1:51:57,23 --> 1:52:1,7
and contraction will begin
on a scale never before seen


2024
1:52:1,7 --> 1:52:4,72
ending a century
long pyramid scheme.


2025
1:52:4,72 --> 1:52:7,57
This has already begun.


2026
1:52:7,57 --> 1:52:11,25
Therefore, we need to expose this
financial failure for what it is


2027
1:52:11,25 --> 1:52:14,8
using this weakness
to our advantage.


2028
1:52:14,8 --> 1:52:16,17
Here are some suggestions:


2029
1:52:16,17 --> 1:52:18,23
Expose the banking fraud.


2030
1:52:18,23 --> 1:52:21,68
Citibank, JP Morgan Chase
and Bank of America


2031
1:52:21,68 --> 1:52:23,458
are the most
powerful controllers


2032
1:52:23,458 --> 1:52:26,65
within the corrupt
Federal Reserve system.


2033
1:52:26,65 --> 1:52:29,75
It's time to boycott
these institutions.


2034
1:52:29,75 --> 1:52:32,99
If you have a bank account or a
credit card with any of them


2035
1:52:32,99 --> 1:52:35,26
move your money to another bank.


2036
1:52:35,26 --> 1:52:38,69
If you have a mortgage,
re-finance with another bank.


2037
1:52:38,69 --> 1:52:40,98
If you own their stock, sell it.


2038
1:52:40,98 --> 1:52:42,92
If you work for them, quit.


2039
1:52:42,92 --> 1:52:45,0
This gesture will
express contempt


2040
1:52:45,0 --> 1:52:48,27
for the true powers behind
the private banking cartel


2041
1:52:48,27 --> 1:52:50,42
known as the Federal Reserve.


2042
1:52:50,42 --> 1:52:54,73
And create awareness about the fraud
of the banking system itself.


2043
1:52:54,73 --> 1:52:57,26
Two: Turn off the TV news.


2044
1:52:57,26 --> 1:53:0,78
Visit the emerging independent
news agencies on the internet


2045
1:53:0,78 --> 1:53:2,33
for your information.


2046
1:53:2,33 --> 1:53:6,79
CNN, NBC, ABC, FOX
and all the others


2047
1:53:6,79 --> 1:53:11,29
present all news pre-filtered
to maintain the status quo.


2048
1:53:11,29 --> 1:53:14,87
With four corporations owning
all major media outlets


2049
1:53:14,87 --> 1:53:17,5
objective information
is impossible.


2050
1:53:17,5 --> 1:53:19,73
This is the true
beauty of the internet


2051
1:53:19,73 --> 1:53:22,0
and the establishment
has been losing control


2052
1:53:22,0 --> 1:53:24,92
because of this free
flow of information.


2053
1:53:24,92 --> 1:53:27,38
We must protect the
internet at all times


2054
1:53:27,38 --> 1:53:30,99
as it is truly our
savior right now.


2055
1:53:30,99 --> 1:53:37,469
Three: Don't ever allow yourself,
your family or anyone you know


2056
1:53:37,469 --> 1:53:37,47
.


2057
1:53:37,47 --> 1:53:41,52
to ever join the military.


2058
1:53:41,52 --> 1:53:43,91
This is an obsolete institution


2059
1:53:43,91 --> 1:53:47,33
now used exclusively for
maintaining an establishment


2060
1:53:47,33 --> 1:53:49,8
that is no longer relevant.


2061
1:53:49,8 --> 1:53:53,579
US soldiers in Iraq work for US
corporations, not the people.


2062
1:53:53,579 --> 1:53:53,58
.


2063
1:53:53,58 --> 1:53:56,82
Propaganda forces us to
believe that war is natural


2064
1:53:56,82 --> 1:53:59,85
and the military is an
honorable institution.


2065
1:53:59,85 --> 1:54:1,46
Well, if war is natural


2066
1:54:1,46 --> 1:54:4,5
why are there 18 suicides
every single day


2067
1:54:4,5 --> 1:54:8,699
by American veterans who have
post-traumatic stress disorder?


2068
1:54:8,699 --> 1:54:8,7
.


2069
1:54:8,7 --> 1:54:11,73
If our military men and
women are so honored


2070
1:54:11,73 --> 1:54:18,519
why is it that 25% of the American
homeless population are veterans?


2071
1:54:18,519 --> 1:54:18,52
.


2072
1:54:18,52 --> 1:54:21,609
Four: Stop supporting
the energy companies.


2073
1:54:21,609 --> 1:54:21,61
.


2074
1:54:21,61 --> 1:54:24,949
If you live in a detached
house, get off the grid.


2075
1:54:24,949 --> 1:54:24,95
.


2076
1:54:24,95 --> 1:54:28,48
Investigate every means of making
your home self-sustainable


2077
1:54:28,48 --> 1:54:30,3
with clean energy.


2078
1:54:30,3 --> 1:54:32,87
Solar, wind and other
renewable energies


2079
1:54:32,87 --> 1:54:35,48
are now affordable
consumer realities


2080
1:54:35,48 --> 1:54:39,24
and considering the never ending
rising costs of traditional energies


2081
1:54:39,24 --> 1:54:42,35
it will likely be a cheaper
investment over time.


2082
1:54:42,35 --> 1:54:45,43
If you drive, get the
smallest car you can


2083
1:54:45,43 --> 1:54:48,49
and consider using one of the
many conversion technologies


2084
1:54:48,49 --> 1:54:50,75
that can enable your
car to be a hybrid


2085
1:54:50,75 --> 1:54:55,51
electric or run on anything
other than establishment fuels.


2086
1:54:55,51 --> 1:54:58,569
Five: Reject the
political system.


2087
1:54:58,569 --> 1:54:58,57
.


2088
1:54:58,57 --> 1:55:2,25
The illusion of democracy is
an insult to our intelligence.


2089
1:55:2,25 --> 1:55:6,0
In a monetary system, there is no
such thing as a true democracy


2090
1:55:6,0 --> 1:55:8,6
and there never was.


2091
1:55:8,6 --> 1:55:9,78
We have two political parties


2092
1:55:9,78 --> 1:55:13,25
owned by the same set
of corporate lobbyists.


2093
1:55:13,25 --> 1:55:16,3
They are placed in their
positions by the corporations


2094
1:55:16,3 --> 1:55:19,97
with popularity artificially
projected by their media.


2095
1:55:19,97 --> 1:55:22,19
In a system of
inherent corruption


2096
1:55:22,19 --> 1:55:24,52
the change of personnel
every couple of years


2097
1:55:24,52 --> 1:55:26,65
has very little relevance.


2098
1:55:26,65 --> 1:55:30,23
Instead of pretending that the
political game has any true meaning


2099
1:55:30,23 --> 1:55:36,32
focus your energy on how to
transcend this failed system.


2100
1:55:36,32 --> 1:55:39,399
And six: Join the movement.


2101
1:55:39,399 --> 1:55:39,4
.


2102
1:55:39,4 --> 1:55:41,63
Go to the thezeitgeistmovement.
com


2103
1:55:41,63 --> 1:55:45,21
and help us create the largest
mass movement for social change


2104
1:55:45,21 --> 1:55:47,47
the world has ever seen.


2105
1:55:47,47 --> 1:55:49,88
We must mobilize and
educate everyone


2106
1:55:49,88 --> 1:55:53,38
about the inherent corruption
of our current world system


2107
1:55:53,38 --> 1:55:56,83
along with the only true
sustainable solution


2108
1:55:56,83 --> 1:55:59,76
declaring all the natural
resources on the planet


2109
1:55:59,76 --> 1:56:2,75
as common heritage to all people


2110
1:56:2,75 --> 1:56:6,67
while informing everyone as to
the true state of technology


2111
1:56:6,67 --> 1:56:10,35
and how we can all be free
if the world works together


2112
1:56:10,35 --> 1:56:12,9
rather than fights.


2113
1:56:12,9 --> 1:56:14,45
The choice lies with you.


2114
1:56:14,45 --> 1:56:17,36
You can continue to be a slave
to the financial system


2115
1:56:17,36 --> 1:56:21,841
and watch the continuous wars, depressions
and injustice across the globe


2116
1:56:21,841 --> 1:56:24,978
while placating yourself
with vain entertainment


2117
1:56:24,978 --> 1:56:26,98
and materialistic garbage;


2118
1:56:26,98 --> 1:56:31,985
or, you can focus your energy on true,
meaningful, lasting, holistic change


2119
1:56:31,985 --> 1:56:35,755
which actually has the
realistic ability to support


2120
1:56:35,755 --> 1:56:40,76
and free all humans with
no one left behind.


2121
1:56:40,76 --> 1:56:44,263
But in the end, the
most relevant change


2122
1:56:44,263 --> 1:56:47,734
must occur first inside of you.


2123
1:56:47,734 --> 1:56:51,971
The real revolution is the
revolution of consciousness


2124
1:56:51,971 --> 1:56:55,408
and each one of us first
needs to eliminate


2125
1:56:55,408 --> 1:56:57,977
the diversionary,
materialistic noise


2126
1:56:57,977 --> 1:57:1,647
we have been conditioned
to think is true;


2127
1:57:1,647 --> 1:57:4,984
while discovering,
amplifying and aligning


2128
1:57:4,984 --> 1:57:11,758
with the signal coming from
our true empirical oneness.


2129
1:57:11,758 --> 1:57:15,595
It is up to you.


2130
1:57:15,595 --> 1:57:20,967
-What we are trying in all these
discussions and talks here


2131
1:57:20,967 --> 1:57:28,274
is to see if we cannot radically bring
about a transformation of the mind.


2132
1:57:28,274 --> 1:57:33,813
Not accept things as they are


2133
1:57:33,813 --> 1:57:36,983
but to understand it, to
go into it, to examine it


2134
1:57:36,983 --> 1:57:41,687
give your heart and your mind with
everything that you have to find out


2135
1:57:41,687 --> 1:57:48,995
a way of living differently.


2136
1:57:48,995 --> 1:57:53,966
But, that depends on you
and not somebody else.


2137
1:57:53,966 --> 1:57:55,968
Because in this
there is no teacher


2138
1:57:55,968 --> 1:57:57,97
no pupil


2139
1:57:57,97 --> 1:58:0,339
there's no leader


2140
1:58:0,339 --> 1:58:1,974
there's no guru


2141
1:58:1,974 --> 1:58:3,976
there's no master, no savior.


2142
1:58:3,976 --> 1:58:9,649
You yourself are the teacher and the pupil, you're
the master, you're the guru, you are the leader


2143
1:58:9,649 --> 1:58:12,618
you are everything!


2144
1:58:12,618 --> 1:58:15,288
And


2145
1:58:15,288 --> 1:58:17,39
to understand


2146
1:58:17,39 --> 1:60:17,39
is to transform what is.
