1
0:0:1,4 --> 0:0:3,235
TRAVIS:
Now on "Rocket City Rednecks"...


2
0:0:3,235 --> 0:0:5,838
We get a challenge from
Papa John himself...


3
0:0:5,838 --> 0:0:7,473
These are the guys.


4
0:0:7,473 --> 0:0:9,909
To build
the ultimate delivery vehicle--


5
0:0:9,909 --> 0:0:13,546
a pizza bike engineered
like only we can.


6
0:0:13,546 --> 0:0:16,649
But in a race between delivery
bike and delivery truck,


7
0:0:16,649 --> 0:0:19,652
will our design fail to deliver?


8
0:0:19,652 --> 0:0:21,153
ROG: You're on fire!


9
0:0:21,153 --> 0:0:23,155
TRAVIS: I'm Travis Taylor.


10
0:0:23,155 --> 0:0:25,424
I'm a rocket scientist in
the space and defense industry


11
0:0:25,424 --> 0:0:28,294
here in my hometown
of Huntsville, Alabama,


12
0:0:28,294 --> 0:0:29,962
where my daddy
helped build the rockets


13
0:0:29,962 --> 0:0:31,564
that sent us to the moon.


14
0:0:31,564 --> 0:0:34,166
DADDY: Have y'all been
drinking rocket fuel again?


15
0:0:34,166 --> 0:0:37,103
TRAVIS: Sometimes big science
moves too slow for me,


16
0:0:37,103 --> 0:0:41,24
so come the weekend,
I round up my best friend Rog,


17
0:0:41,24 --> 0:0:43,542
my nephew, Michael,
and my buddy, Pete,


18
0:0:43,542 --> 0:0:45,44
to tackle important problems


19
0:0:45,44 --> 0:0:47,847
with a little
down-home ingenuity.


20
0:0:47,847 --> 0:0:52,251
ROG: Damn it, boy!


21
0:0:52,251 --> 0:0:53,752
TRAVIS: Right on.


22
0:0:53,752 --> 0:0:55,955
Hey, is there any more
beers in the cooler?


23
0:0:55,955 --> 0:0:59,158
This weekend started off
a bit different.


24
0:0:59,158 --> 0:1:0,526
The whole gang came over


25
0:1:0,526 --> 0:1:3,195
for a video call
with John Schnatter,


26
0:1:3,195 --> 0:1:6,232
the CEO and "Papa"
of Papa John's Pizza.


27
0:1:6,232 --> 0:1:8,167
He wanted to talk to us.


28
0:1:8,167 --> 0:1:9,335
Now, this should be interesting.


29
0:1:9,335 --> 0:1:11,67
Hey, John!


30
0:1:11,67 --> 0:1:14,573
Yeah, it's Travis Taylor
and the rest of the guys here.


31
0:1:14,573 --> 0:1:15,741
JOHN SCHNATTER:
You know I'm a fan of the show,


32
0:1:15,741 --> 0:1:17,42
and I know you're
a fan of my pizzas.


33
0:1:17,42 --> 0:1:18,177
TRAVIS: Yeah, cool.


34
0:1:18,177 --> 0:1:19,712
JOHN: I wanted
to talk to you guys


35
0:1:19,712 --> 0:1:21,347
about something
we're working on at Papa John's.


36
0:1:21,347 --> 0:1:23,82
As you know,
we're constantly improving.


37
0:1:23,82 --> 0:1:26,318
In some big cities we're testing
the concept of using bicycles


38
0:1:26,318 --> 0:1:28,621
to deliver pizza faster,


39
0:1:28,621 --> 0:1:29,989
so I thought
maybe you could come up


40
0:1:29,989 --> 0:1:31,557
with some of that
redneck ingenuity


41
0:1:31,557 --> 0:1:32,992
to help us build
the ultimate pizza bike.


42
0:1:32,992 --> 0:1:35,261
TRAVIS: Well, I believe
we can do it.


43
0:1:35,261 --> 0:1:36,562
What we need to know, though,


44
0:1:36,562 --> 0:1:39,598
is what you need
a pizza delivery bike to do.


45
0:1:39,598 --> 0:1:42,168
JOHN: I think it needs to carry
multiple pizzas and drinks,


46
0:1:42,168 --> 0:1:43,269
it needs to keep the pizza hot,


47
0:1:43,269 --> 0:1:44,737
and it needs
to keep the drinks cold,


48
0:1:44,737 --> 0:1:47,206
and it needs to communicate
back to home base.


49
0:1:47,206 --> 0:1:50,142
TRAVIS: Yeah! We can come up
with something great for you.


50
0:1:50,142 --> 0:1:52,144
JOHN: Appreciate it.
Thanks, guys.


51
0:1:52,144 --> 0:1:54,28
TRAVIS: We understand why
Papa John wants to do this


52
0:1:54,28 --> 0:1:56,882
because if you're delivering
pizzas in the city


53
0:1:56,882 --> 0:1:58,25
and you've got all that traffic,


54
0:1:58,25 --> 0:1:59,885
it'd be a lot easier
if you could zip in and out,


55
0:1:59,885 --> 0:2:2,21
and the more pizzas
you could put on the bike,


56
0:2:2,21 --> 0:2:5,791
the better off you'd be.


57
0:2:5,791 --> 0:2:7,76
Look, we got to have
all these things.


58
0:2:7,76 --> 0:2:10,529
Let's think about it.
If you got a bicycle...


59
0:2:10,529 --> 0:2:13,332
I think our biggest challenge
is keeping the pizza hot


60
0:2:13,332 --> 0:2:14,967
while on a long bike ride.


61
0:2:14,967 --> 0:2:17,77
So, instead of using
some kind of warming bag,


62
0:2:17,77 --> 0:2:21,473
I want to create an actual
pizza oven on the bike.


63
0:2:21,473 --> 0:2:23,776
It's a pizza kitchen on wheels.


64
0:2:23,776 --> 0:2:26,245
Somehow we got to put an oven
back in here


65
0:2:26,245 --> 0:2:27,88
that's gonna hold five pizzas.


66
0:2:27,88 --> 0:2:30,816
The big challenge of this build
is gonna be weight and balance


67
0:2:30,816 --> 0:2:33,285
because we're gonna be adding
at least 40 pounds


68
0:2:33,285 --> 0:2:34,453
to the back of this bike


69
0:2:34,453 --> 0:2:37,156
with the drink cooler
and the pizza oven.


70
0:2:37,156 --> 0:2:39,825
And since everything has to be
custom-fit to the bike,


71
0:2:39,825 --> 0:2:42,595
we can't just go buy
our components off the shelf,


72
0:2:42,595 --> 0:2:46,332
so we cooked up our own recipe
for our homemade pizza oven.


73
0:2:46,332 --> 0:2:49,134
The first ingredient
is angle aluminum,


74
0:2:49,134 --> 0:2:50,903
which we'll use
to whip up a rack


75
0:2:50,903 --> 0:2:52,738
that will fit five pizzas.


76
0:2:52,738 --> 0:2:55,908
Then we'll blend in parts
from a camping stove,


77
0:2:55,908 --> 0:2:58,577
like battery-powered
heating elements and wiring


78
0:2:58,577 --> 0:3:0,679
and attach them along the frame.


79
0:3:0,679 --> 0:3:2,14
For the finishing touch,


80
0:3:2,14 --> 0:3:4,45
we'll cover the whole thing
in insulation


81
0:3:4,45 --> 0:3:5,618
and skin it with aluminum,


82
0:3:5,618 --> 0:3:8,921
and--bam--we've got
ourselves a pizza oven.


83
0:3:8,921 --> 0:3:11,19
I put Pete and Rog
working on the oven.


84
0:3:11,19 --> 0:3:13,525
Rog, you and Pete figured out


85
0:3:13,525 --> 0:3:15,461
how big that pizza oven's
got to be yet?


86
0:3:15,461 --> 0:3:18,497
ROG: Yeah. I don't have
any fancy degrees or anything,


87
0:3:18,497 --> 0:3:20,633
but something tells me
this pizza oven


88
0:3:20,633 --> 0:3:23,335
has to be big enough
to fit a pizza box.


89
0:3:23,335 --> 0:3:25,704
TRAVIS: Well, why aren't
you working on it?


90
0:3:25,704 --> 0:3:27,673
Where's Pete? ROG: Pete!


91
0:3:27,673 --> 0:3:30,409
TRAVIS: I picked up
some empty pizza boxes


92
0:3:30,409 --> 0:3:32,244
we could use during the build


93
0:3:32,244 --> 0:3:34,28
to make sure everything
fits perfectly.


94
0:3:34,28 --> 0:3:37,716
TRAVIS: I don't know
how to make a pizza box.


95
0:3:37,716 --> 0:3:40,753
There's got to be a trick
to making a pizza box.


96
0:3:40,753 --> 0:3:42,721
ROG: How many rocket scientists
does it take


97
0:3:42,721 --> 0:3:44,59
to put together a pizza box?


98
0:3:44,59 --> 0:3:47,359
MICHAEL: Hang on,
I think you gotta start up here.


99
0:3:47,359 --> 0:3:48,827
There you go.


100
0:3:48,827 --> 0:3:50,696
That's got to go on the inside.


101
0:3:50,696 --> 0:3:51,83
[laughs]


102
0:3:51,83 --> 0:3:53,232
TRAVIS:
That will do good enough.


103
0:3:53,232 --> 0:3:55,267
MICHAEL: Push the little tops.
TRAVIS: Yeah, like that.


104
0:3:55,267 --> 0:3:56,635
All right, that's close enough.


105
0:3:56,635 --> 0:4:0,39
ROG: We wanted the pizza boxes
to slide into a rack,


106
0:4:0,39 --> 0:4:2,508
so we notched out
and bent some aluminum angle


107
0:4:2,508 --> 0:4:3,842
to make a frame.


108
0:4:3,842 --> 0:4:5,444
PETE: Just take that over
to the grinder.


109
0:4:5,444 --> 0:4:7,713
TRAVIS: While those guys
worked on the oven rack,


110
0:4:7,713 --> 0:4:10,316
me, Michael, and Daddy
got the oven platform together.


111
0:4:10,316 --> 0:4:11,95
DADDY: We thought,
"This is gonna be


112
0:4:11,95 --> 0:4:14,42
the easiest thing we've
ever done," but I'm concerned.


113
0:4:14,42 --> 0:4:17,222
Every time you jump into
one of these all you gotta do's,


114
0:4:17,222 --> 0:4:19,758
you wind up on
the short end of the stick.


115
0:4:19,758 --> 0:4:23,195
TRAVIS: Just bolt it together.


116
0:4:23,195 --> 0:4:25,197
TRAVIS: You got a level.
Where's the level, Daddy?


117
0:4:25,197 --> 0:4:27,66
ROG: I know a lot about pizza,


118
0:4:27,66 --> 0:4:29,101
so when I saw Charlie
with that level,


119
0:4:29,101 --> 0:4:31,704
I had to step in before
they made a major mistake.


120
0:4:31,704 --> 0:4:34,606
Hey, hey, before
you tighten it,


121
0:4:34,606 --> 0:4:36,909
do we not want the pizzas
at an angle?


122
0:4:36,909 --> 0:4:39,78
MICHAEL: We want 'em level.
ROG: I was trying to tell 'em


123
0:4:39,78 --> 0:4:41,48
if the oven
wasn't angled up on the back,


124
0:4:41,48 --> 0:4:44,49
those pizzas were gonna fly out
as soon as he started pedaling.


125
0:4:44,49 --> 0:4:46,719
ROG: Them pizzas gonna
fall out of that.


126
0:4:46,719 --> 0:4:48,554
DADDY: Alright, there you go.


127
0:4:48,554 --> 0:4:50,823
MICHAEL:
We're gonna pick it up level,


128
0:4:50,823 --> 0:4:52,57
You wanna go higher than level?


129
0:4:52,57 --> 0:4:53,425
ROG: Just a little bit.


130
0:4:53,425 --> 0:4:56,695
DADDY: That's a hair
above level right there.


131
0:4:56,695 --> 0:4:58,797
ROG: You can't weld nothing.


132
0:4:58,797 --> 0:5:1,233
TRAVIS: Before we welded
anything to the platform,


133
0:5:1,233 --> 0:5:3,102
I wanted to check the weight
and balance distribution


134
0:5:3,102 --> 0:5:5,137
of the bike.


135
0:5:5,137 --> 0:5:7,473
So we loaded about 30 pounds
of sandbags onto the rack,


136
0:5:7,473 --> 0:5:9,41
and then I took it
for a test drive.


137
0:5:9,41 --> 0:5:11,443
Crap, look at that!


138
0:5:11,443 --> 0:5:12,845
God!


139
0:5:12,845 --> 0:5:15,47
What?
I'm not doing that!


140
0:5:15,47 --> 0:5:16,982
DADDY: That's got to be
operator malfunction.


141
0:5:16,982 --> 0:5:18,517
MICHAEL:
Holler at him. Tell him.


142
0:5:18,517 --> 0:5:20,85
DADDY: Operator error!


143
0:5:20,85 --> 0:5:22,788
TRAVIS: The problem seemed to be
that the weight of the bags


144
0:5:22,788 --> 0:5:24,356
was out over the end
of the wheel.


145
0:5:24,356 --> 0:5:27,292
Normally, a bike has most
of the weight over the center.


146
0:5:27,292 --> 0:5:28,961
Now the weight
was way off-center,


147
0:5:28,961 --> 0:5:32,631
and it was making me barely able
to keep the bike upright.


148
0:5:32,631 --> 0:5:33,966
We've got a lot to change


149
0:5:33,966 --> 0:5:35,634
and to straighten out
and rethink,


150
0:5:35,634 --> 0:5:37,436
and we're gonna get there.


151
0:5:37,436 --> 0:5:40,472
Yeah, I don't know what
to say about it right now.


152
0:5:40,472 --> 0:5:42,508
DADDY: This thing's going
every way but right.


153
0:5:42,508 --> 0:5:45,544
Now, who would've thought
it'd be complicated


154
0:5:45,544 --> 0:5:48,247
to build a bicycle for pizza?


155
0:5:48,247 --> 0:5:50,449
TRAVIS: We messed around with
the placement of the sandbags


156
0:5:50,449 --> 0:5:52,317
to adjust the center of gravity.


157
0:5:52,317 --> 0:5:53,852
MICHAEL: Is that any different?


158
0:5:53,852 --> 0:5:55,821
TRAVIS:
Yeah, that's a lot better.


159
0:5:55,821 --> 0:5:57,656
And it made it ride less wobbly.


160
0:5:57,656 --> 0:5:59,925
Now that we've figured out
a better weight distribution...


161
0:5:59,925 --> 0:6:1,86
Yeah, I could ride on this.


162
0:6:1,86 --> 0:6:4,363
We got back to work
on the oven and the cooler.


163
0:6:4,363 --> 0:6:5,898
Well, let's go.


164
0:6:5,898 --> 0:6:7,866
Get that weight off there.
Let's mount that oven.


165
0:6:7,866 --> 0:6:9,334
Finish building
that oven Pete, Rog.


166
0:6:9,334 --> 0:6:11,236
What are y'all doing?
Build that thing!


167
0:6:11,236 --> 0:6:14,173
ROG: I got my part done.
TRAVIS: Where's the other part?


168
0:6:14,173 --> 0:6:16,975
TRAVIS: We used the elements
out of a 12-volt camping oven


169
0:6:16,975 --> 0:6:18,544
to put in our pizza oven.


170
0:6:18,544 --> 0:6:20,12
These things should work fine,


171
0:6:20,12 --> 0:6:22,14
and they work off of
a 12-volt battery.


172
0:6:22,14 --> 0:6:24,116
Rog worked on the door
for the oven,


173
0:6:24,116 --> 0:6:25,617
while Pete did the wiring.


174
0:6:25,617 --> 0:6:26,819
PETE: Rog, I think
we're about ready


175
0:6:26,819 --> 0:6:28,32
to put this thing together.


176
0:6:28,32 --> 0:6:29,588
TRAVIS: I took it upon myself


177
0:6:29,588 --> 0:6:31,79
to build the cooler
for the two-liter soda bottles.


178
0:6:31,79 --> 0:6:32,891
The oven and the cooler


179
0:6:32,891 --> 0:6:34,793
were both covered
with insulating foam


180
0:6:34,793 --> 0:6:37,29
to keep the heat
and the cold in.


181
0:6:37,29 --> 0:6:39,97
Then we covered them
in sheet metal


182
0:6:39,97 --> 0:6:40,833
for protection
from the elements.


183
0:6:40,833 --> 0:6:44,136
PETE: Chefs,
step away from your tables.


184
0:6:44,136 --> 0:6:46,4
MICHAEL:
There's our battery ready.


185
0:6:46,4 --> 0:6:47,973
TRAVIS: When Michael
finished installing the battery,


186
0:6:47,973 --> 0:6:51,9
I sent him to get some pizzas
so we could do a test run.


187
0:6:51,9 --> 0:6:53,946
Now we just need to get the
cooler and the oven on the bike.


188
0:6:53,946 --> 0:6:55,314
MICHAEL: Why don't we just
bungee cord it on there?


189
0:6:55,314 --> 0:6:57,916
TRAVIS: No. Make me a frame
that it slides into.


190
0:6:57,916 --> 0:6:59,351
Put a stop right here.


191
0:6:59,351 --> 0:7:2,788
Just come up over it with
the three-quarter inch tubing.


192
0:7:2,788 --> 0:7:4,189
Or one inch, I don't care.


193
0:7:4,189 --> 0:7:6,91
MICHAEL: You need to wait
till you get the oven in there


194
0:7:6,91 --> 0:7:8,293
and mount it in so it slides.


195
0:7:8,293 --> 0:7:12,64
TRAVIS: And before long,
it looked ready to ride,


196
0:7:12,64 --> 0:7:14,366
until I saw
what Michael was doing.


197
0:7:14,366 --> 0:7:17,69
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't like it.
I told you what to do.


198
0:7:17,69 --> 0:7:20,72
I do not want it bungeed on,
Michael Taylor,


199
0:7:20,72 --> 0:7:21,974
'cause look--
when you start doing that,


200
0:7:21,974 --> 0:7:23,509
that bungee's
going to let it do that.


201
0:7:23,509 --> 0:7:26,545
I want you to weld me
a bar across here.


202
0:7:26,545 --> 0:7:28,347
ROG: He done told you!


203
0:7:28,347 --> 0:7:30,282
TRAVIS: Hardheaded boy!


204
0:7:30,282 --> 0:7:32,918
ROG: I'm tired of counting
how many times he told you.


205
0:7:32,918 --> 0:7:34,86
DADDY:
I've tried to argue with them.


206
0:7:34,86 --> 0:7:35,921
I never win
with either one of 'em.


207
0:7:35,921 --> 0:7:37,756
They're both just hardheaded,
and I tell 'em


208
0:7:37,756 --> 0:7:39,958
they take it after
their mother and their grandma.


209
0:7:39,958 --> 0:7:43,128
TRAVIS: Daddy, I wouldn't
be saying that out loud.


210
0:7:43,128 --> 0:7:46,665
ROG: I don't know what Travis
has against bungee cords,


211
0:7:46,665 --> 0:7:49,101
so Michael welded it up
just like he asked,


212
0:7:49,101 --> 0:7:52,4
and once again,
the diva got what he wanted,


213
0:7:52,4 --> 0:7:54,106
and we loaded her up
with pizza,


214
0:7:54,106 --> 0:7:55,44
which gave me an idea.


215
0:7:55,44 --> 0:7:58,377
Hey, somebody got to 
feed them kids, man.


216
0:7:58,377 --> 0:8:0,212
TRAVIS: What?
Feed them kids?


217
0:8:0,212 --> 0:8:1,446
ROG: Yeah, carry it over
to my house.


218
0:8:1,446 --> 0:8:3,215
TRAVIS:
Carry it to your house?


219
0:8:3,215 --> 0:8:4,683
All right,
well, that's about what?


220
0:8:4,683 --> 0:8:6,952
Five or six miles from here?
That's not a bad delivery test.


221
0:8:6,952 --> 0:8:8,62
ROG:
I don't think it's that far.


222
0:8:8,62 --> 0:8:11,56
TRAVIS: I'm gonna deliver
these pizzas to Rog's house.


223
0:8:11,56 --> 0:8:13,125
I'm gonna test drive
the fully loaded bike


224
0:8:13,125 --> 0:8:14,927
for a few miles
to make sure


225
0:8:14,927 --> 0:8:18,53
that all the earlier weight and
balance problems are solved.


226
0:8:18,53 --> 0:8:21,667
Once that's settled, we'll add
the communications systems


227
0:8:21,667 --> 0:8:23,468
that Papa John wanted.


228
0:8:23,468 --> 0:8:25,837
MICHAEL: Now kick that thing up,
and it'll stay. There you go.


229
0:8:25,837 --> 0:8:27,773
TRAVIS: We'll make it look cool


230
0:8:27,773 --> 0:8:30,375
and present
the finished bike to him.


231
0:8:30,375 --> 0:8:34,346
So I hit the road
with pizza bike version one.


232
0:8:34,346 --> 0:8:36,515
ROG:
Shake it, don't break it!


233
0:8:36,515 --> 0:8:38,35
Look at him wiggling like that.


234
0:8:38,35 --> 0:8:39,651
MICHAEL: Don't shake the Cokes!


235
0:8:39,651 --> 0:8:41,987
TRAVIS: It took a little bit
just to get started


236
0:8:41,987 --> 0:8:44,122
because the bike
is a little unstable.


237
0:8:44,122 --> 0:8:52,731
PETE: Drain a gear and push it!


238
0:8:52,731 --> 0:8:55,167
TRAVIS: Whoa!
Can't stand up on it.


239
0:8:55,167 --> 0:8:57,536
You certainly can't stand up
on the thing to climb hills.


240
0:8:57,536 --> 0:9:1,64
That's a problem.


241
0:9:1,64 --> 0:9:3,742
MICHAEL:
Drive that thing straight.


242
0:9:3,742 --> 0:9:5,611
Keep it in the road!
TRAVIS: Shut up!


243
0:9:5,611 --> 0:9:7,846
PETE: I'm a little bit
concerned about this bike.


244
0:9:7,846 --> 0:9:9,481
It just seems like
it's really wobbly.


245
0:9:9,481 --> 0:9:12,351
ROG: Don't lose him, Pete.


246
0:9:12,351 --> 0:9:14,119
TRAVIS:
If I get going really slow,


247
0:9:14,119 --> 0:9:16,188
then I start wobbling,
and it gets pretty scary.


248
0:9:16,188 --> 0:9:18,924
MICHAEL: Need me
to get out and push?


249
0:9:18,924 --> 0:9:20,392
TRAVIS: Shut up!


250
0:9:20,392 --> 0:9:24,229
Crap!


251
0:9:24,229 --> 0:9:28,367
ROG: You all right, bubba?


252
0:9:28,367 --> 0:9:31,837
MICHAEL: You all right?
TRAVIS: Yeah.


253
0:9:31,837 --> 0:9:35,73
As it started wobbling,
the front tire got off the road,


254
0:9:35,73 --> 0:9:36,8
and I crashed pretty good.


255
0:9:36,8 --> 0:9:42,681
Crap!


256
0:9:42,681 --> 0:9:45,384
You get too slow,
you just can't...


257
0:9:45,384 --> 0:9:46,885
you can't handle it.


258
0:9:46,885 --> 0:9:48,253
DADDY: We were
concerned he got hurt,


259
0:9:48,253 --> 0:9:50,856
but we checked on him.
He wasn't hurt; just his pride.


260
0:9:50,856 --> 0:9:52,658
ROG: Stay with it.


261
0:9:52,658 --> 0:9:54,926
TRAVIS: Well, hope
they don't mind us delivering


262
0:9:54,926 --> 0:9:56,628
some shook-up Coca-Colas, Rog.


263
0:9:56,628 --> 0:9:59,398
Center of gravity's
just way high.


264
0:9:59,398 --> 0:10:2,367
Soon as you slow down
to climb a hill,


265
0:10:2,367 --> 0:10:4,503
then it's just--I mean,
it's all my strength


266
0:10:4,503 --> 0:10:7,205
to just keep it from
falling over side to side.


267
0:10:7,205 --> 0:10:9,174
Center of gravity has gotta be
lower to the ground.


268
0:10:9,174 --> 0:10:12,77
MICHAEL: You gonna go to Rog's,
or we gonna load it up?


269
0:10:12,77 --> 0:10:15,8
TRAVIS: Well, I mean,
I can get on over this hill.


270
0:10:15,8 --> 0:10:16,782
DADDY:
Travis gets back on the bike,


271
0:10:16,782 --> 0:10:19,184
and he's still gonna take
these pizzas over to Rog's.


272
0:10:19,184 --> 0:10:22,22
PETE: All right, ready?
TRAVIS: Yeah.


273
0:10:22,22 --> 0:10:25,29
DADDY: And he gets about
a quarter mile on up the road.


274
0:10:25,29 --> 0:10:27,993
ROG: I smell something.
MICHAEL: I smell something.


275
0:10:27,993 --> 0:10:29,695
[horn honking]


276
0:10:29,695 --> 0:10:32,23
ROG: You're on fire!
DADDY: Hey, Travis!


277
0:10:32,23 --> 0:10:34,8
And the whole back end
of the bike is on fire.


278
0:10:34,8 --> 0:10:37,235
[honking]


279
0:10:37,235 --> 0:10:44,276
And he don't even know it.


280
0:10:44,276 --> 0:10:46,378
Daddy: These experiments are
dangerous.


281
0:10:46,378 --> 0:10:48,914
These guys are real rocket
scientests.


282
0:10:48,914 --> 0:10:52,5
Don't try this at home.


283
0:10:52,5 --> 0:10:54,252
TRAVIS: The CEO of Papa John's


284
0:10:54,252 --> 0:10:55,987
asked us
to build him a prototype


285
0:10:55,987 --> 0:10:57,823
for a pizza delivery bike,


286
0:10:57,823 --> 0:10:59,124
but so far...


287
0:10:59,124 --> 0:11:0,125
Crap!


288
0:11:0,125 --> 0:11:1,46
It hasn't delivered.


289
0:11:1,46 --> 0:11:3,829
But I hadn't even seen
the worst of it yet.


290
0:11:3,829 --> 0:11:5,464
ROG: You're on fire!


291
0:11:5,464 --> 0:11:7,766
DADDY: The whole back end
of the bike is on fire.


292
0:11:7,766 --> 0:11:9,601
And he don't even know it.


293
0:11:9,601 --> 0:11:11,203
DADDY: Look out.


294
0:11:11,203 --> 0:11:14,139
You're on fire, boy!


295
0:11:14,139 --> 0:11:16,141
ROG: Who's gonna
feed them kids?


296
0:11:16,141 --> 0:11:17,509
TRAVIS:
I didn't know it was on fire


297
0:11:17,509 --> 0:11:18,81
until it was getting
out of hand,


298
0:11:18,81 --> 0:11:20,779
and Daddy and Pete were
honking the horn and yelling,


299
0:11:20,779 --> 0:11:23,148
and Michael and Rog were yelling
that I had a fire.


300
0:11:23,148 --> 0:11:24,983
I thought they were telling me
I was just on fire


301
0:11:24,983 --> 0:11:27,652
and was riding pretty good.


302
0:11:27,652 --> 0:11:29,588
MICHAEL: What in the world?


303
0:11:29,588 --> 0:11:31,256
DADDY: How could that thing
catch on fire in there


304
0:11:31,256 --> 0:11:32,724
with a pizza?


305
0:11:32,724 --> 0:11:34,993
TRAVIS:
When I crashed back there,


306
0:11:34,993 --> 0:11:37,329
I bet we shorted out
them heating elements.


307
0:11:37,329 --> 0:11:38,63
I think your kids
are gonna have to eat


308
0:11:38,63 --> 0:11:40,232
some peanut butter and jelly
tonight or something.


309
0:11:40,232 --> 0:11:43,401
MICHAEL: Get in the truck.
Let's load this bike up.


310
0:11:43,401 --> 0:11:45,971
TRAVIS: It's been
a long, tiring day,


311
0:11:45,971 --> 0:11:47,939
so we decided to pack it in


312
0:11:47,939 --> 0:11:50,108
and start bright and early
tomorrow morning.


313
0:11:50,108 --> 0:11:51,643
We've got a lot of fixing to do


314
0:11:51,643 --> 0:11:57,949
if we're gonna have a working
pizza bike to show Papa John.


315
0:11:57,949 --> 0:12:0,352
But one thing
I wanna make sure we got


316
0:12:0,352 --> 0:12:3,588
is somehow for me to know if
this thing were to catch on fire


317
0:12:3,588 --> 0:12:6,91
or start getting too hot,
that I could shut it off.


318
0:12:6,91 --> 0:12:7,692
First thing we got to do


319
0:12:7,692 --> 0:12:10,829
is keep the oven
from catching on fire again.


320
0:12:10,829 --> 0:12:12,697
So I'm thinking we need to put
a temperature probe in there


321
0:12:12,697 --> 0:12:15,167
that somehow's
got a screen up here


322
0:12:15,167 --> 0:12:18,203
that I can tell if it's getting
too hot or whatever.


323
0:12:18,203 --> 0:12:20,772
The biggest thing with this bike
right now is stability.


324
0:12:20,772 --> 0:12:22,274
It wobbled like crazy.


325
0:12:22,274 --> 0:12:24,75
The reason the bike wobbles


326
0:12:24,75 --> 0:12:26,578
is that the center of gravity
is still too far to the rear.


327
0:12:26,578 --> 0:12:28,18
Can't move the oven up.


328
0:12:28,18 --> 0:12:31,616
We have another option:
make the bike longer.


329
0:12:31,616 --> 0:12:33,652
You know, when we went to
the beach a couple years ago,


330
0:12:33,652 --> 0:12:36,288
Calista wasn't old enough
to ride a bike yet,


331
0:12:36,288 --> 0:12:37,923
but she was old enough
to pedal a tricycle,


332
0:12:37,923 --> 0:12:39,291
and I rented this bike.


333
0:12:39,291 --> 0:12:41,226
It had one wheel come off here,


334
0:12:41,226 --> 0:12:44,62
and it had handlebars on it
and a pedal.


335
0:12:44,62 --> 0:12:45,263
Yeah, and she rode it,


336
0:12:45,263 --> 0:12:46,765
and that thing was stable
as all get out.


337
0:12:46,765 --> 0:12:48,33
We went over trails and stuff.


338
0:12:48,33 --> 0:12:49,734
That's what we need.
We need one of those.


339
0:12:49,734 --> 0:12:50,936
Why don't you and Rog
call around


340
0:12:50,936 --> 0:12:52,704
and see if y'all can find one,


341
0:12:52,704 --> 0:12:54,84
then maybe run over
and get one somewhere.


342
0:12:54,84 --> 0:12:57,442
ROG: Road trip, man.
MICHAEL: Let's ride, man.


343
0:12:57,442 --> 0:12:59,177
TRAVIS: The beer stores
ain't open yet,


344
0:12:59,177 --> 0:13:0,712
so y'all oughta be back soon.


345
0:13:0,712 --> 0:13:3,215
Now the plan is to
add a kid's trailer bike


346
0:13:3,215 --> 0:13:4,816
to our pizza bike--


347
0:13:4,816 --> 0:13:7,385
a third wheel which will
change the center of gravity,


348
0:13:7,385 --> 0:13:9,588
making the bike more stable.


349
0:13:9,588 --> 0:13:12,457
And we'll fix
the oven and cooler.


350
0:13:12,457 --> 0:13:14,259
We'll put
a see-through door on it


351
0:13:14,259 --> 0:13:15,56
and a temperature gauge


352
0:13:15,56 --> 0:13:18,96
with the read-out
mounted on the handlebars.


353
0:13:18,96 --> 0:13:22,33
That's also where we'll need to
put the GPS and a Smartphone.


354
0:13:22,33 --> 0:13:23,235
While we're at it,


355
0:13:23,235 --> 0:13:25,971
we decided to throw in
a sensor alert system,


356
0:13:25,971 --> 0:13:30,175
which will warn us if we get too
close to crashing into anything.


357
0:13:30,175 --> 0:13:33,111
While they were gone, we started
figuring out how to fix the oven


358
0:13:33,111 --> 0:13:35,714
and how to mount all that stuff
to the handlebars.


359
0:13:35,714 --> 0:13:38,383
ROG: You ain't done nothing,
man, since we been gone.


360
0:13:38,383 --> 0:13:39,718
MICHAEL: It don't look like
y'all doing nothing.


361
0:13:39,718 --> 0:13:41,72
TRAVIS: Oh, shut up. We've been
working hard up in here.


362
0:13:41,72 --> 0:13:44,322
ROG: Charlie's the only one
that's been working, I bet.


363
0:13:44,322 --> 0:13:47,125
TRAVIS: Hey, look at that.
That's it right there.


364
0:13:47,125 --> 0:13:52,33
That is exactly
what I was talking about.


365
0:13:52,33 --> 0:13:55,634
Hey, y'all break that bicycle
while you're at it.


366
0:13:55,634 --> 0:13:58,47
MICHAEL: I'm trying. This thing
don't wanna go together.


367
0:13:58,47 --> 0:14:1,406
Too many moving parts here.


368
0:14:1,406 --> 0:14:3,41
TRAVIS: Well, quit moving!


369
0:14:3,41 --> 0:14:4,142
ROG: Y'all be cool.


370
0:14:4,142 --> 0:14:6,144
MICHAEL: We should
walk off this job here.


371
0:14:6,144 --> 0:14:7,412
TRAVIS:
We had some minor setbacks,


372
0:14:7,412 --> 0:14:10,48
but it's all
coming together now.


373
0:14:10,48 --> 0:14:14,52
Before long, our third wheel
was set and the oven was ready.


374
0:14:14,52 --> 0:14:16,354
MICHAEL: We got us a good
set up oven now.


375
0:14:16,354 --> 0:14:17,589
TRAVIS: I've been working
on communication systems


376
0:14:17,589 --> 0:14:20,392
with a GPS, proximity sensors,
and all kinds of cool stuff.


377
0:14:20,392 --> 0:14:23,728
Next we need to get all that
mounted on the handlebars


378
0:14:23,728 --> 0:14:25,297
and wired up to the batteries.


379
0:14:25,297 --> 0:14:26,998
Watch out. There's cameras
and sensors everywhere


380
0:14:26,998 --> 0:14:29,0
wired onto this thing.


381
0:14:29,0 --> 0:14:31,69
PETE: And it's heavy.
TRAVIS: It is heavy.


382
0:14:31,69 --> 0:14:34,272
All right, that seat post
goes into the seat post hole.


383
0:14:34,272 --> 0:14:35,573
PETE: Okay.


384
0:14:35,573 --> 0:14:37,142
TRAVIS:
Into the saddle hole, Pete.


385
0:14:37,142 --> 0:14:39,377
PETE: Once I knew what
the trailer would look like,


386
0:14:39,377 --> 0:14:41,212
I built a much sturdier mount
for the oven


387
0:14:41,212 --> 0:14:42,714
and dropped it about six inches


388
0:14:42,714 --> 0:14:44,983
to bring
the center of gravity lower.


389
0:14:44,983 --> 0:14:47,719
TRAVIS: And then
right into the handlebar mount.


390
0:14:47,719 --> 0:14:50,488
That bar ends--that's about
right where the bar's pointing.


391
0:14:50,488 --> 0:14:51,69
MICHAEL: No, you got to 
point it down.


392
0:14:51,69 --> 0:14:53,692
TRAVIS: No, bar handles
are like that.


393
0:14:53,692 --> 0:14:55,226
I raced for years, Michael.


394
0:14:55,226 --> 0:14:58,96
And I raced on this bicycle.
I know right where I want 'em.


395
0:14:58,96 --> 0:15:0,432
Then we added
the best part of all:


396
0:15:0,432 --> 0:15:2,667
power assist.


397
0:15:2,667 --> 0:15:5,27
Back when I was huffing
and puffing up that hill,


398
0:15:5,27 --> 0:15:7,272
I thought, "Man, I need help."


399
0:15:7,272 --> 0:15:9,507
So we're making
an electrical bike engine


400
0:15:9,507 --> 0:15:11,142
out of two power drills.


401
0:15:11,142 --> 0:15:12,777
We'll attach 'em
to the rear pedals


402
0:15:12,777 --> 0:15:14,612
with triggers
on the handlebars,


403
0:15:14,612 --> 0:15:16,181
and when those drills
start spinning,


404
0:15:16,181 --> 0:15:19,25
it'll be like having
another person pedaling.


405
0:15:19,25 --> 0:15:20,885
We need to hurry up
and get this done, y'all,


406
0:15:20,885 --> 0:15:24,289
'cause we got to test
this thing for Papa John.


407
0:15:24,289 --> 0:15:25,89
What I'm thinking we're gonna do


408
0:15:25,89 --> 0:15:28,59
is I'm gonna race Michael
delivering pizzas.


409
0:15:28,59 --> 0:15:30,662
We'll go over to the University
of Alabama Huntsville,


410
0:15:30,662 --> 0:15:33,64
and we'll deliver some pizzas
to some college kids


411
0:15:33,64 --> 0:15:34,399
or something over there.


412
0:15:34,399 --> 0:15:36,134
I'm gonna be pedaling this,


413
0:15:36,134 --> 0:15:40,271
and then Michael, I figure,
can be the pizza delivery boy,


414
0:15:40,271 --> 0:15:42,507
using his truck.


415
0:15:42,507 --> 0:15:45,76
MICHAEL: You can't compete
with a pickup truck.


416
0:15:45,76 --> 0:15:47,245
TRAVIS: We shall see.


417
0:15:47,245 --> 0:15:50,548
We're gonna have us a race
that will prove the pizza bike


418
0:15:50,548 --> 0:15:52,917
is a better delivery system
than a car.


419
0:15:52,917 --> 0:15:55,2
Michael thinks
he's gonna win this race,


420
0:15:55,2 --> 0:15:58,89
but he doesn't
realize my advantage.


421
0:15:58,89 --> 0:15:59,557
Delivery trucks
get around great


422
0:15:59,557 --> 0:16:1,926
on the country roads
around here,


423
0:16:1,926 --> 0:16:4,262
but the pizza bike
will really come in handy


424
0:16:4,262 --> 0:16:7,565
in high-density areas,
like a city or college.


425
0:16:7,565 --> 0:16:8,733
I know that the students


426
0:16:8,733 --> 0:16:10,602
at the University
of Alabama Huntsville


427
0:16:10,602 --> 0:16:12,137
order a lot of pizza,


428
0:16:12,137 --> 0:16:13,972
so it's the perfect place
for our test,


429
0:16:13,972 --> 0:16:17,108
if we can just
get this thing finished.


430
0:16:17,108 --> 0:16:19,611
PETE: After we got
our communications array


431
0:16:19,611 --> 0:16:21,112
and the oven and cooler
mounted again,


432
0:16:21,112 --> 0:16:23,882
we added the final element:


433
0:16:23,882 --> 0:16:26,317
training wheels.


434
0:16:26,317 --> 0:16:29,54
Travis says they're to hold
the power drills in place.


435
0:16:29,54 --> 0:16:34,626
That's what he says, anyway.


436
0:16:34,626 --> 0:16:37,729
TRAVIS: We got to UAH
with the pizza delivery bike,


437
0:16:37,729 --> 0:16:42,1
then we checked in with the
on-campus Papa John's kitchen.


438
0:16:42,1 --> 0:16:43,768
This is where
we'll pick up the pizza orders


439
0:16:43,768 --> 0:16:45,37
for the college kids.


440
0:16:45,37 --> 0:16:46,738
Before we kicked off the race,


441
0:16:46,738 --> 0:16:49,107
I wanted to show John
the finished bike.


442
0:16:49,107 --> 0:16:50,375
JOHN:
Let's take a look at the bike.


443
0:16:50,375 --> 0:16:52,71
TRAVIS: This is the bike
that we made.


444
0:16:52,71 --> 0:16:54,612
Look right here.
This is our pizza oven.


445
0:16:54,612 --> 0:16:56,14
You can put five pizzas in it.


446
0:16:56,14 --> 0:16:58,483
You got fans, heating elements
that keep 'em warm.


447
0:16:58,483 --> 0:17:1,419
We got motors on this thing
to help us get up a hill.


448
0:17:1,419 --> 0:17:3,822
This is where the drinks go,
in the cooler.


449
0:17:3,822 --> 0:17:6,191
Then up here,
here's our control board.


450
0:17:6,191 --> 0:17:8,93
We got GPS right here.


451
0:17:8,93 --> 0:17:11,129
We got proximity sensors
tell us if somebody's around.


452
0:17:11,129 --> 0:17:13,331
Then we also have
a temperature gauge,


453
0:17:13,331 --> 0:17:15,467
tells what temperature
the oven is.


454
0:17:15,467 --> 0:17:16,968
And then, yeah, we got a horn


455
0:17:16,968 --> 0:17:18,837
in case we need
to honk at anybody.


456
0:17:18,837 --> 0:17:21,473
So then right here we got
triggers to run the drills.


457
0:17:21,473 --> 0:17:24,809
So this is the bike, and we're
about to have a competition.


458
0:17:24,809 --> 0:17:26,444
JOHN: That's unbelievable!


459
0:17:26,444 --> 0:17:28,413
You guys put
a lot of work into it.


460
0:17:28,413 --> 0:17:29,981
I'd love to see what it can do.


461
0:17:29,981 --> 0:17:32,484
TRAVIS: All right, cool.
Let's get ready to do this test.


462
0:17:32,484 --> 0:17:34,152
Michael,
I'm gonna whip your butt.


463
0:17:34,152 --> 0:17:36,654
MICHAEL: You ain't gonna do it.
Let's go get some pizza.


464
0:17:36,654 --> 0:17:38,456
We'll be back, John.


465
0:17:38,456 --> 0:17:41,92
There's no way
he can out-pedal me.


466
0:17:41,92 --> 0:17:43,828
DADDY: The pizza's are in there,
so let's go get 'em.


467
0:17:43,828 --> 0:17:46,931
So, are you ready?
Get set...


468
0:17:46,931 --> 0:17:50,602
Go!


469
0:17:50,602 --> 0:17:52,737
TRAVIS:
You can't deliver nothing!


470
0:17:52,737 --> 0:17:54,5
MICHAEL: Yeah, I can.


471
0:17:54,5 --> 0:17:55,507
MAN: Pick one!


472
0:17:55,507 --> 0:17:58,309
[laughing]


473
0:17:58,309 --> 0:18:0,845
Good luck, guys!
TRAVIS: Thanks, man!


474
0:18:0,845 --> 0:18:3,81
ROG: They came out of the store
about the same time.


475
0:18:3,81 --> 0:18:5,984
I jumped in the truck
with Michael as an observer


476
0:18:5,984 --> 0:18:8,219
while Travis loaded up the bike.


477
0:18:8,219 --> 0:18:10,488
MICHAEL: Hey, Uncle Travis,
we'll see you later.


478
0:18:10,488 --> 0:18:17,395
TRAVIS: Yeah, I hear you.
ROG: Stay with it, mule! 


479
0:18:17,395 --> 0:18:18,863
TRAVIS: We built
the ultimate pizza delivery bike


480
0:18:18,863 --> 0:18:20,431
for Papa John's.


481
0:18:20,431 --> 0:18:24,335
Now we're putting it to the test
with a race at the UAH campus.


482
0:18:24,335 --> 0:18:27,639
Michael's already off to the
first delivery in his truck.


483
0:18:27,639 --> 0:18:29,207
My start isn't going as well.


484
0:18:29,207 --> 0:18:31,142
PETE: Good luck, Travis.
DADDY: Good luck, son!


485
0:18:31,142 --> 0:18:33,444
TRAVIS: We'll see, y'all.
PETE: Show 'em how it's done.


486
0:18:33,444 --> 0:18:34,546
MICHAEL: I was pretty confident


487
0:18:34,546 --> 0:18:36,214
that my truck
would beat that bike,


488
0:18:36,214 --> 0:18:38,883
but I saw Uncle Travis
had some tricks up his sleeve.


489
0:18:38,883 --> 0:18:40,785
ROG: There he is right there!


490
0:18:40,785 --> 0:18:42,854
TRAVIS: They may be
a lot faster on the road,


491
0:18:42,854 --> 0:18:44,789
but I can cut through
parking lots,


492
0:18:44,789 --> 0:18:45,957
ride on the sidewalks,


493
0:18:45,957 --> 0:18:47,825
or whatever it takes
to shave off seconds.


494
0:18:47,825 --> 0:18:50,361
Plus, I know this campus
really well.


495
0:18:50,361 --> 0:18:52,263
MICHAEL: Where are we at?
ROG: I don't know.


496
0:18:52,263 --> 0:18:54,632
PETE: Since Travis was gonna
take some shortcuts,


497
0:18:54,632 --> 0:18:56,968
Charlie and I couldn't
follow him by truck,


498
0:18:56,968 --> 0:18:58,836
but he kept us updated.


499
0:18:58,836 --> 0:19:0,838
TRAVIS: Hey, Pete, I can see
Michael up ahead of me.


500
0:19:0,838 --> 0:19:2,674
I'm almost to my first delivery.


501
0:19:2,674 --> 0:19:7,278
PETE: Awesome, awesome.


502
0:19:7,278 --> 0:19:9,547
TRAVIS: You can't
deliver nothing!


503
0:19:9,547 --> 0:19:11,616
ROG: Stay with it, mule.


504
0:19:11,616 --> 0:19:14,419
TRAVIS:
Did y'all order a pizza?


505
0:19:14,419 --> 0:19:16,221
MICHAEL: Hey!


506
0:19:16,221 --> 0:19:17,555
TRAVIS: You watch out.
Don't drop it!


507
0:19:17,555 --> 0:19:19,424
MICHAEL: Hey, did you
order this pizza?


508
0:19:19,424 --> 0:19:22,26
Here you go, man.
Look at that.


509
0:19:22,26 --> 0:19:24,195
Have a good one.


510
0:19:24,195 --> 0:19:25,53
See ya!


511
0:19:25,53 --> 0:19:26,831
TRAVIS: Thank you, man.
Y'all have a good one.


512
0:19:26,831 --> 0:19:27,999
MICHAEL:
Where are we going next?


513
0:19:27,999 --> 0:19:31,69
TRAVIS: Game on!
You can't deliver nothing!


514
0:19:31,69 --> 0:19:33,271
MICHAEL: I'm getting hungry
smelling all them pizzas, Rog.


515
0:19:33,271 --> 0:19:35,707
ROG: I'm fixing
to open one of 'em up.


516
0:19:35,707 --> 0:19:37,942
After the first stop,
I was thinking,


517
0:19:37,942 --> 0:19:40,878
those college kids don't need
double of all those pizzas.


518
0:19:40,878 --> 0:19:43,414
MICHAEL: Do it. Get us a piece
of pizza out of the bottom box.


519
0:19:43,414 --> 0:19:45,817
ROG: It's free pizza
for them anyway.


520
0:19:45,817 --> 0:19:49,187
MICHAEL: We can't eat
all of 'em now.


521
0:19:49,187 --> 0:19:51,256
TRAVIS: I think
I've caught up with Michael


522
0:19:51,256 --> 0:19:52,59
or I'm ahead of him.


523
0:19:52,59 --> 0:19:54,92
PETE: Hell, yeah.
Keep going, man.


524
0:19:54,92 --> 0:19:56,461
MICHAEL: Uncle Travis, he cut
through everywhere in the grass.


525
0:19:56,461 --> 0:19:59,697
I had to go around these
stop signs and red lights.


526
0:19:59,697 --> 0:20:0,865
MICHAEL: Another red light.


527
0:20:0,865 --> 0:20:5,97
TRAVIS: Oh, sh...ah!


528
0:20:5,97 --> 0:20:7,305
Hello!


529
0:20:7,305 --> 0:20:11,542
Here's your pizza.
Hold on, I got you a drink.


530
0:20:11,542 --> 0:20:12,343
MICHAEL: Here it is.


531
0:20:12,343 --> 0:20:13,811
PETE: How you doing, Travis?


532
0:20:13,811 --> 0:20:15,546
TRAVIS: I just delivered
the second pizza.


533
0:20:15,546 --> 0:20:17,348
I don't see Michael nowhere.


534
0:20:17,348 --> 0:20:19,817
ROG: Where's Travis?
There he is right there!


535
0:20:19,817 --> 0:20:21,85
Look at him!


536
0:20:21,85 --> 0:20:26,624
TRAVIS: Ha! Ha ha!
You can't deliver nothing!


537
0:20:26,624 --> 0:20:28,96
MICHAEL: That made me mad
when he passed us by,


538
0:20:28,96 --> 0:20:31,262
him just off-roading
all over campus.


539
0:20:31,262 --> 0:20:35,833
MICHAEL: Yeah! This woman
ordered this pizza.


540
0:20:35,833 --> 0:20:37,135
Hey, have a good day!


541
0:20:37,135 --> 0:20:39,637
TRAVIS: Man, Michael
was right on my tail,


542
0:20:39,637 --> 0:20:41,739
and he could catch me
any minute.


543
0:20:41,739 --> 0:20:43,207
I wasn't about
to let up for a second.


544
0:20:43,207 --> 0:20:45,877
This is a race to the finish.


545
0:20:45,877 --> 0:20:48,613
Oh! Whoa.


546
0:20:48,613 --> 0:20:49,781
I was getting pretty tired,


547
0:20:49,781 --> 0:20:51,616
and the race was
getting down to the wire.


548
0:20:51,616 --> 0:20:52,95
When I hit this incline,


549
0:20:52,95 --> 0:20:56,854
I knew it was time
to kick in the power assist.


550
0:20:56,854 --> 0:20:58,189
Nice.


551
0:20:58,189 --> 0:21:1,292
Hey Pete, I just used
the drill motors.


552
0:21:1,292 --> 0:21:2,827
It worked out awesome.


553
0:21:2,827 --> 0:21:4,128
It's giving me a little bit
of advantage, I hope.


554
0:21:4,128 --> 0:21:7,999
PETE: Well, that is
too cool, man.


555
0:21:7,999 --> 0:21:11,202
TRAVIS: The final stop
was at a fraternity house.


556
0:21:11,202 --> 0:21:14,105
Man, I was really hoping these
guys didn't have pizzas already


557
0:21:14,105 --> 0:21:15,707
when I pulled up.


558
0:21:15,707 --> 0:21:19,444
Woo! Some of you fellas order
some pizzas up in here?


559
0:21:19,444 --> 0:21:23,47
Yeah! Hey, Pete, I'm delivering
my last run right now.


560
0:21:23,47 --> 0:21:24,482
PETE: All right, man.


561
0:21:24,482 --> 0:21:25,817
We're gonna see you out front.
We're on our way.


562
0:21:25,817 --> 0:21:30,788
TRAVIS: Pass 'em around.
Y'all have a good one.


563
0:21:30,788 --> 0:21:32,79
Y'all stay with it.


564
0:21:32,79 --> 0:21:34,759
MICHAEL:
What's going on, fellas?


565
0:21:34,759 --> 0:21:38,96
They already had some pizzas,
so I knew Uncle Travis beat us


566
0:21:38,96 --> 0:21:40,231
and was on his way
back to Papa John's.


567
0:21:40,231 --> 0:21:42,1
DADDY: Well, looks like
you beat Michael.


568
0:21:42,1 --> 0:21:44,268
TRAVIS: I beat him like crazy.


569
0:21:44,268 --> 0:21:47,238
First thing I did
was call up Papa John


570
0:21:47,238 --> 0:21:49,273
to fill him in on the race.


571
0:21:49,273 --> 0:21:53,111
Hey, John, we beat Michael
in the delivery truck.


572
0:21:53,111 --> 0:21:55,46
I still don't see him anywhere,


573
0:21:55,46 --> 0:21:57,315
so we made one heck
of a pizza delivery bike.


574
0:21:57,315 --> 0:21:59,217
JOHN: You guys are winners.
Great job!


575
0:21:59,217 --> 0:22:2,387
I love the fact that your bike
is really pushing the envelope.


576
0:22:2,387 --> 0:22:4,255
TRAVIS: It is. Heck yeah!


577
0:22:4,255 --> 0:22:6,491
JOHN: If some of the kinks
get worked out, who knows?


578
0:22:6,491 --> 0:22:8,426
Maybe you guys
can get a contract,


579
0:22:8,426 --> 0:22:11,763
or at least trade it in for
a bunch of Papa John's pizzas.


580
0:22:11,763 --> 0:22:13,164
TRAVIS: That's right!


581
0:22:13,164 --> 0:22:14,565
This has been a fun trip.
Thanks a lot.


582
0:22:14,565 --> 0:22:17,735
JOHN: Great job.


583
0:22:17,735 --> 0:22:19,437
PETE: There they are.


584
0:22:19,437 --> 0:22:22,39
DADDY: I guess you know
who won this race.


585
0:22:22,39 --> 0:22:25,51
TRAVIS: I proved real quickly
that I could deliver something


586
0:22:25,51 --> 0:22:27,578
and that Michael
couldn't deliver nothing.


587
0:22:27,578 --> 0:22:29,313
The ovens worked good.


588
0:22:29,313 --> 0:22:31,315
It turns left better
than it turns right.


589
0:22:31,315 --> 0:22:33,351
MICHAEL: You could deliver pizza
to NASCAR races.


590
0:22:33,351 --> 0:24:33,351
TRAVIS: I could deliver
pizza at NASCAR, man.
