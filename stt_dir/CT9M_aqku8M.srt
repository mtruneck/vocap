0:0:43,72 --> 0:0:48,905

0:0:49,47 --> 0:0:50,97
Yeah.

0:0:50,97 --> 0:0:53,33

0:0:54,38 --> 0:0:55,25
SHAN: What are you
going to do.


27
0:0:55,25 --> 0:0:58,8
MALE SPEAKER: I'm going to go
south, where it's warm and I


28
0:0:58,8 --> 0:0:59,66
think that's about it.


29
0:0:59,66 --> 0:1:0,6
Get warm.


30
0:1:0,6 --> 0:1:1,1
That's what black people like.


31
0:1:1,1 --> 0:1:1,83
We like to be warm.


32
0:1:1,83 --> 0:1:5,209
So this cold weather shit's
for, like, white people.


33
0:1:5,209 --> 0:1:7,32
SHAN: Are you going to do
anything to celebrate?


34
0:1:7,32 --> 0:1:7,48
MALE SPEAKER: No.


35
0:1:7,48 --> 0:1:8,74
I have to work.


36
0:1:8,74 --> 0:1:9,74
All day.


37
0:1:9,74 --> 0:1:12,87
SHAN: What are you going
to do today?


38
0:1:12,87 --> 0:1:14,76
MALE SPEAKER: I might do the
same thing I did last year,


39
0:1:14,76 --> 0:1:17,88
was I read a little bit about
him when I got home.


40
0:1:17,88 --> 0:1:21,5
And like, that's mostly it.


41
0:1:21,5 --> 0:1:24,48
Just read about him, and
like, what he did.


42
0:1:24,48 --> 0:1:28,95
SHAN: So you read a little
bit about him every year.


43
0:1:28,95 --> 0:1:31,15
So maybe when you're
50, you would know


44
0:1:31,15 --> 0:1:33,11
everything about him.


45
0:1:33,11 --> 0:1:35,78
What do you know
about Dr. King?


46
0:1:35,78 --> 0:1:37,68
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, he was
leader of the black civil


47
0:1:37,68 --> 0:1:39,46
rights movements here.


48
0:1:39,46 --> 0:1:41,31
MALE SPEAKER: The whites didn't
like him, and so he


49
0:1:41,31 --> 0:1:45,6
protested and he had this speech
that he had a dream for


50
0:1:45,6 --> 0:1:49,45
everybody to be the same,
equal rights.


51
0:1:49,45 --> 0:1:51,64
SHAN: Very, very impressive.


52
0:1:51,64 --> 0:1:56,3
FEMALE SPEAKER: I have a dream
my English teacher came out


53
0:1:56,3 --> 0:1:59,11
and he said, oh, you're
English is so poor.


54
0:1:59,11 --> 0:2:0,96
You have to try more.


55
0:2:0,96 --> 0:2:4,58
MALE SPEAKER: I had a dream that
I was teaching kids and


56
0:2:4,58 --> 0:2:8,15
one of them turned
into my boss.


57
0:2:8,15 --> 0:2:10,789
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're actually
experimenting with dreams at


58
0:2:10,789 --> 0:2:11,38
the moment.


59
0:2:11,38 --> 0:2:14,5
You have to go to this forest
in your dream and then meet


60
0:2:14,5 --> 0:2:16,36
this cat there while a brass
band is playing.


61
0:2:16,36 --> 0:2:18,39
SHAN: So what about, if you were
going to cook one dinner


62
0:2:18,39 --> 0:2:22,37
for Dr. King, what would
you serve him?


63
0:2:22,37 --> 0:2:23,34
Crispy kale.


64
0:2:23,34 --> 0:2:24,53
MALE SPEAKER: Maybe I'd just
have a burrito, right?


65
0:2:24,53 --> 0:2:26,11
Everybody likes Mexican food.


66
0:2:26,11 --> 0:2:27,26
FEMALE SPEAKER: Fish.


67
0:2:27,26 --> 0:2:28,25
SHAN: What type of fish?


68
0:2:28,25 --> 0:2:29,39
FEMALE SPEAKER: Whitefish.


69
0:2:29,39 --> 0:2:31,19
And steamed potatoes.


70
0:2:31,19 --> 0:2:32,38
We call that nursery food.


71
0:2:32,38 --> 0:2:33,21
SHAN: Nursery food?


72
0:2:33,21 --> 0:2:34,262
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


73
0:2:34,262 --> 0:2:35,43
It heals everything.


74
0:2:35,43 --> 0:2:37,93
And we'd make him miso
soup as well.


75
0:2:37,93 --> 0:2:44,33
SHAN: What do you think Dr. King
needs to be healed for?


76
0:2:44,33 --> 0:2:45,93
FEMALE SPEAKER: Needs
to be healed for?


77
0:2:45,93 --> 0:2:47,896
Being assassinated, I suppose.


78
0:2:47,896 --> 0:2:49,22
SHAN: Oh, OK.


79
0:2:49,22 --> 0:2:49,82
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
