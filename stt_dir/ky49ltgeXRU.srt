0:0:1,482 --> 0:0:2,732
[MUSIC - I'M IN YOU, "HERE
COMES THE WAR"]


3
0:0:2,732 --> 0:0:6,43



4
0:0:6,43 --> 0:0:8,7
THOMAS MORTON: If there's
anybody more excited about the


5
0:0:8,7 --> 0:0:10,93
impending '90s revival than us
and Mudhoney frontman Mark


6
0:0:10,93 --> 0:0:13,86
Arm, it is the militia
movement.


7
0:0:13,86 --> 0:0:17,15
Born out of the baby-ridden
ashes of Waco and Ruby Ridge,


8
0:0:17,15 --> 0:0:19,49
groups of armed citizens, like
the Tri-States Militia of


9
0:0:19,49 --> 0:0:22,74
South Dakota and Norm Olson's
Michigan Militia, coalesced to


10
0:0:22,74 --> 0:0:24,84
the delight of hack TV reporters
and editorial


11
0:0:24,84 --> 0:0:26,62
cartoonists worldwide.


12
0:0:26,62 --> 0:0:28,96
Though their depiction in the
media typically ranged from


13
0:0:28,96 --> 0:0:31,6
hey, look at these kooky
anti-government gun nuts to


14
0:0:31,6 --> 0:0:34,48
hey, look at these kooky
anti-government racists, the


15
0:0:34,48 --> 0:0:37,32
movement's numbers
grew and grew.


16
0:0:37,32 --> 0:0:39,97
They were even making inroads
into mainstream politics until


17
0:0:39,97 --> 0:0:42,77
Tim McVeigh pulled off the
ultimate PR coup by blowing up


18
0:0:42,77 --> 0:0:45,84
149 people and 19 children
in Oklahoma City.


19
0:0:45,84 --> 0:0:48,396



20
0:0:48,396 --> 0:0:50,64
Plagued by its association with
the attack, the militia


21
0:0:50,64 --> 0:0:53,46
movement foundered, and as one
of its most visible groups,


22
0:0:53,46 --> 0:0:57,57
the Michigan Militia bore the
brunt of the shit storm.


23
0:0:57,57 --> 0:0:59,65
There were allegations that
the Nichols brothers and


24
0:0:59,65 --> 0:1:2,0
McVeigh were members,
brow-beatings at the hands of


25
0:1:2,0 --> 0:1:4,84
congressional pantywaists like
Arlen Specter, and lively


26
0:1:4,84 --> 0:1:7,31
infighting by militia members
upset over the leadership's


27
0:1:7,31 --> 0:1:11,65
alternative hypothesis
for the bombing.


28
0:1:11,65 --> 0:1:14,39
The militia disbanded in the
early '00s, and founders Norm


29
0:1:14,39 --> 0:1:17,66
Olson and Ray Southwell left
Michigan for Alaska.


30
0:1:17,66 --> 0:1:19,76
While this seemed like the sad
but likely end to their


31
0:1:19,76 --> 0:1:22,32
endeavor, according to a
Homeland Security report


32
0:1:22,32 --> 0:1:25,7
earlier this year, militia
activity, like ketamine and


33
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:28,11
Docs with shorts, is once
again on the hot list.


34
0:1:28,11 --> 0:1:30,51
And Norm and Ray are gearing up
to hit the reunion circuit.


35
0:1:30,51 --> 0:1:31,51
RAY SOUTHWELL: How're
you doing?


36
0:1:31,51 --> 0:1:32,1
THOMAS MORTON: Thomas.


37
0:1:32,1 --> 0:1:32,21
RAY SOUTHWELL: Thomas.


38
0:1:32,21 --> 0:1:33,11
THOMAS MORTON: How
are you doing?


39
0:1:33,11 --> 0:1:33,86
RAY SOUTHWELL: Fine, fine.


40
0:1:33,86 --> 0:1:35,76
You're from the VBS TV, huh?


41
0:1:35,76 --> 0:1:36,23
THOMAS MORTON: Yes.


42
0:1:36,23 --> 0:1:36,578
RAY SOUTHWELL: Well,
come on in.


43
0:1:36,578 --> 0:1:37,55
We've got a lot to
talk about here.


44
0:1:37,55 --> 0:1:38,14
THOMAS MORTON: [LAUGHTER].


45
0:1:38,14 --> 0:1:40,8
RAY SOUTHWELL: [INAUDIBLE].


46
0:1:40,8 --> 0:1:43,69
THOMAS MORTON: Hi, I'm in
Nikiski, Alaska, on the Kenai


47
0:1:43,69 --> 0:1:47,266
Peninsula with Norman Olson and
Ray Southwell, formally of


48
0:1:47,266 --> 0:1:48,19
the Michigan Militia.


49
0:1:48,19 --> 0:1:50,29
Currently of the
Alaska Militia.


50
0:1:50,29 --> 0:1:54,82
NORMAN OLSON: Hi, I'm Norman
Olson, and a longtime


51
0:1:54,82 --> 0:1:57,25
proponent of the Constitution.


52
0:1:57,25 --> 0:2:0,6
20-year-plus military veteran.


53
0:2:0,6 --> 0:2:3,26
Standing by the red,
white, and blue,


54
0:2:3,26 --> 0:2:4,28
no matter what happens.


55
0:2:4,28 --> 0:2:7,96
And telling it like it is.


56
0:2:7,96 --> 0:2:9,75
Michigan Militia from
the very beginning.


57
0:2:9,75 --> 0:2:11,36
This goes back to, let's see.


58
0:2:11,36 --> 0:2:12,68
Dates--


59
0:2:12,68 --> 0:2:16,36
oh, 1994.


60
0:2:16,36 --> 0:2:19,32
Started the little
militia in--


61
0:2:19,32 --> 0:2:24,2
in fact, this one goes back
even earlier than that.


62
0:2:24,2 --> 0:2:26,6
"Patriots gather to rail
against the 'New World


63
0:2:26,6 --> 0:2:29,93
Order.'" My, were we
young then, huh?


64
0:2:29,93 --> 0:2:33,14
Year number one was what was
called Operation Visibility.


65
0:2:33,14 --> 0:2:35,24
We knew that we had
to become visible.


66
0:2:35,24 --> 0:2:37,61
If we didn't maintain our
visibility, we couldn't


67
0:2:37,61 --> 0:2:38,88
maintain our legitimacy.


68
0:2:38,88 --> 0:2:41,76
It's so important that if you
believe in what you're doing


69
0:2:41,76 --> 0:2:44,73
is right, you've got to stand up
and make yourself visible.


70
0:2:44,73 --> 0:2:47,11
Look at that mean look
on that man's face.


71
0:2:47,11 --> 0:2:48,44
Oh, boy.


72
0:2:48,44 --> 0:2:51,25
But we were just regulars,
trying to point out that we're


73
0:2:51,25 --> 0:2:52,2
not the terrorists.


74
0:2:52,2 --> 0:2:53,5
We're counter-terrorists.


75
0:2:53,5 --> 0:2:55,31
We're going to stop
those people that


76
0:2:55,31 --> 0:2:56,54
are destroying America.


77
0:2:56,54 --> 0:3:0,35
RAY SOUTHWELL: What we've always
done with our militia--


78
0:3:0,35 --> 0:3:3,19
and this is what people don't
understand, again--


79
0:3:3,19 --> 0:3:6,84
militias command information.


80
0:3:6,84 --> 0:3:8,34
So I may be a commander.


81
0:3:8,34 --> 0:3:10,4
My job is not to give
you orders.


82
0:3:10,4 --> 0:3:14,76
My job as a commander is to give
you information so that


83
0:3:14,76 --> 0:3:18,59
you sort that out in your own
conscience and decide what


84
0:3:18,59 --> 0:3:20,5
action you should take.


85
0:3:20,5 --> 0:3:22,77
The army is command control.


86
0:3:22,77 --> 0:3:25,35
You're my soldier, I'm going to
give you an order, and you


87
0:3:25,35 --> 0:3:27,13
better carry it out.


88
0:3:27,13 --> 0:3:29,93
An example, when you go back
to the Revolutionary War,


89
0:3:29,93 --> 0:3:32,15
Washington had a heck
of a time when the


90
0:3:32,15 --> 0:3:33,76
militia would show up.


91
0:3:33,76 --> 0:3:36,16
The militia was not
command control.


92
0:3:36,16 --> 0:3:38,19
If these guys got there and
they looked at that


93
0:3:38,19 --> 0:3:41,3
battlefield and they decided,
this is not a battle worth


94
0:3:41,3 --> 0:3:43,3
fighting, they left.


95
0:3:43,3 --> 0:3:47,1
That's the way it
is today, too.


96
0:3:47,1 --> 0:3:49,76
NORMAN OLSON: So we went fast
all over the country, starting


97
0:3:49,76 --> 0:3:51,305
up militias in every state.


98
0:3:51,305 --> 0:3:55,2
Some of our militia training
exercises brought in folks


99
0:3:55,2 --> 0:3:56,555
from all over the country.


100
0:3:56,555 --> 0:3:59,93
But we'd put on these training
sessions, dog-and-pony shows,


101
0:3:59,93 --> 0:4:1,39
and the media loved that too.


102
0:4:1,39 --> 0:4:3,44
They came in from all over the
world to see what we were


103
0:4:3,44 --> 0:4:5,833
doing, because it never happened
before, since 1776,


104
0:4:5,833 --> 0:4:7,75
you know, of course.


105
0:4:7,75 --> 0:4:12,5
Or 1775, I should say, Lexington
and Concord.


106
0:4:12,5 --> 0:4:14,55
And we were growing and getting


107
0:4:14,55 --> 0:4:17,0
more national exposure.


108
0:4:17,0 --> 0:4:20,12
RAY SOUTHWELL: Our goal was
to unite these militias.


109
0:4:20,12 --> 0:4:23,6
And understand, there's militias
all over the country,


110
0:4:23,6 --> 0:4:25,99
all over the peninsula, but
they're small groups-- five


111
0:4:25,99 --> 0:4:27,65
people, ten people.


112
0:4:27,65 --> 0:4:30,96
So we networked with each other
so we can be a unified


113
0:4:30,96 --> 0:4:37,8
force, a protective force, so we
don't have to call upon the


114
0:4:37,8 --> 0:4:40,6
federal troops or Blackwater.


115
0:4:40,6 --> 0:4:42,95
THOMAS MORTON: It's important,
it would seem to me, that it'd


116
0:4:42,95 --> 0:4:49,78
be as important in times of
crisis or impending crisis as


117
0:4:49,78 --> 0:4:55,28
it is in times of well-being
to have what the Second


118
0:4:55,28 --> 0:4:56,68
Amendment describes, which
you're talking about-- an


119
0:4:56,68 --> 0:4:57,97
unorganized citizens' militia.


120
0:4:57,97 --> 0:5:0,75



121
0:5:0,75 --> 0:5:4,3
How do you go about that
in times when--


122
0:5:4,3 --> 0:5:5,82
NORMAN OLSON: In
times of peace?


123
0:5:5,82 --> 0:5:6,67
THOMAS MORTON: Bingo.


124
0:5:6,67 --> 0:5:8,45
Of fatness, good--


125
0:5:8,45 --> 0:5:8,69
NORMAN OLSON: Here's
the thing.


126
0:5:8,69 --> 0:5:11,83
When you put a life preserver on
your child and you're going


127
0:5:11,83 --> 0:5:14,38
out on a lake, do
you do it after?


128
0:5:14,38 --> 0:5:16,7
Or do you do it with the
perception that something


129
0:5:16,7 --> 0:5:17,95
could happen out on the lake?


130
0:5:17,95 --> 0:5:18,855
Of course you do.


131
0:5:18,855 --> 0:5:21,56
You don't wait for your
child to drown.


132
0:5:21,56 --> 0:5:22,8
You think ahead.


133
0:5:22,8 --> 0:5:25,58
You're frightened of the
possible situation.


134
0:5:25,58 --> 0:5:29,23
That fear motivates you
to do something good.


135
0:5:29,23 --> 0:5:29,8
So is the--


136
0:5:29,8 --> 0:5:30,95
RAY SOUTHWELL: Who would
you rather trust?


137
0:5:30,95 --> 0:5:32,87
Your neighbor, or a stranger?


138
0:5:32,87 --> 0:5:34,13
NORMAN OLSON: Yeah.


139
0:5:34,13 --> 0:5:35,37
RAY SOUTHWELL: You
know, that's--


140
0:5:35,37 --> 0:5:37,4
NORMAN OLSON: And when somebody
comes rolling up your


141
0:5:37,4 --> 0:5:41,87
driveway, when the lights go
out, would you be comforted if


142
0:5:41,87 --> 0:5:44,47
you knew it was your neighbors
in it, bringing over a


143
0:5:44,47 --> 0:5:47,51
generator or bringing over
foodstuffs, rather than a big,


144
0:5:47,51 --> 0:5:51,1
black SUV coming to take
your guns away?


145
0:5:51,1 --> 0:5:53,45
Again, to keep the control.


146
0:5:53,45 --> 0:5:56,9
So the question is, who will
come in to aid us?


147
0:5:56,9 --> 0:5:57,96
If we are well-disciplined
and well-trained and


148
0:5:57,96 --> 0:6:0,15
well-equipped, then we
can take care of


149
0:6:0,15 --> 0:6:1,27
ourselves, thank you.


150
0:6:1,27 --> 0:6:3,41
But you see, the media won't
allow that to happen.


151
0:6:3,41 --> 0:6:7,66
The media has to spin it so that
we are always demonized


152
0:6:7,66 --> 0:6:11,26
with misinformation and looked
at as the bogeyman running


153
0:6:11,26 --> 0:6:14,56
around the woods with our
cammies on, rather than people


154
0:6:14,56 --> 0:6:19,316
who can help and organize
each other.


155
0:6:19,316 --> 0:6:20,45
It looks like Mark Farner.


156
0:6:20,45 --> 0:6:21,49
You know Mark Farner?


157
0:6:21,49 --> 0:6:22,6
THOMAS MORTON: Um, Grand
Funk, right?


158
0:6:22,6 --> 0:6:23,4
NORMAN OLSON: Yeah, yeah.


159
0:6:23,4 --> 0:6:23,835
He's a personal friend
of ours.


160
0:6:23,835 --> 0:6:24,9
THOMAS MORTON: Oh.


161
0:6:24,9 --> 0:6:24,527
Neat.


162
0:6:24,527 --> 0:6:26,712
NORMAN OLSON: Yeah,
he's a good boy.


163
0:6:26,712 --> 0:6:28,58
THOMAS MORTON: Are you guys
buddies with the Nuge?


164
0:6:28,58 --> 0:6:29,83
NORMAN OLSON: Oh yeah,
you betcha.


165
0:6:29,83 --> 0:6:33,826
We did a program on the steps
of the Capitol with Ted.


166
0:6:33,826 --> 0:6:37,45
Ray and I went out to Montana
there, we went up to the FBI


167
0:6:37,45 --> 0:6:40,49
lines, and I was carrying a
teddy bear, and Ray was


168
0:6:40,49 --> 0:6:42,39
carrying a Red Cross pack.


169
0:6:42,39 --> 0:6:45,12
What we want to do is humanize
it, put a human face on it, so


170
0:6:45,12 --> 0:6:47,37
that those people wouldn't
be bulldozed.


171
0:6:47,37 --> 0:6:50,65
Western New York that I helped,
they were going to


172
0:6:50,65 --> 0:6:53,44
bulldoze his house trailer
because it didn't comply with


173
0:6:53,44 --> 0:6:56,2
building codes.


174
0:6:56,2 --> 0:6:59,9
We went to help this old
gentleman, bless his heart.


175
0:6:59,9 --> 0:7:0,61
Here's an old fellow
that was--


176
0:7:0,61 --> 0:7:3,5
he was a construction worker in
Northern Michigan, 87 years


177
0:7:3,5 --> 0:7:4,58
old, he and his wife.


178
0:7:4,58 --> 0:7:6,92
And they had all this old
machinery on their property.


179
0:7:6,92 --> 0:7:8,81
Well, the county came out and
said it was a blight and they


180
0:7:8,81 --> 0:7:10,14
had to remove it all.


181
0:7:10,14 --> 0:7:12,83
And so we went out there and
faced down the sheriff and


182
0:7:12,83 --> 0:7:14,395
fought for him for
a long time.


183
0:7:14,395 --> 0:7:15,65
The Stitt family.


184
0:7:15,65 --> 0:7:21,0
And they lived down a little
island in northern Lake Huron,


185
0:7:21,0 --> 0:7:23,15
and they were being pushed off
the island because they were


186
0:7:23,15 --> 0:7:24,98
preparing for Y2K.


187
0:7:24,98 --> 0:7:26,78
And they were raising chickens
and emus and


188
0:7:26,78 --> 0:7:28,13
all sorts of stuff.


189
0:7:28,13 --> 0:7:29,93
THOMAS MORTON: Were they
trying to grow hemp?


190
0:7:29,93 --> 0:7:30,58
NORMAN OLSON: I think so.


191
0:7:30,58 --> 0:7:32,935
Now I don't have anything bad
to say about marijuana.


192
0:7:32,935 --> 0:7:35,28
To me, it's just like alcohol.


193
0:7:35,28 --> 0:7:36,63
All things in moderation.


194
0:7:36,63 --> 0:7:38,91
I'm a libertarian when
it comes to that.


195
0:7:38,91 --> 0:7:42,12
Again, it's a human right.


196
0:7:42,12 --> 0:7:45,81
If it's a measure of relaxation
and enjoyment, then


197
0:7:45,81 --> 0:7:48,73
what's the difference between
smoking a joint or popping a


198
0:7:48,73 --> 0:7:50,33
Quaalude, you know?


199
0:7:50,33 --> 0:7:54,19
We went out there
to support them.


200
0:7:54,19 --> 0:7:57,784
We're always trying to support
the little guy, you know?


201
0:7:57,784 --> 0:8:3,5



202
0:8:3,5 --> 0:8:5,3
THOMAS MORTON: One thing that's
marked a lot of the


203
0:8:5,3 --> 0:8:9,87
coverage and, I think, has
muddied the waters is trying


204
0:8:9,87 --> 0:8:12,96
to overlay many of
these issues with


205
0:8:12,96 --> 0:8:15,16
kind of racial politics.


206
0:8:15,16 --> 0:8:15,63
Mitch--


207
0:8:15,63 --> 0:8:18,3
NORMAN OLSON: Mitch
[INAUDIBLE].


208
0:8:18,3 --> 0:8:19,21
He was a Hawaiian.


209
0:8:19,21 --> 0:8:20,1
THOMAS MORTON: Ah.


210
0:8:20,1 --> 0:8:20,61
NORMAN OLSON: Yeah, yeah.


211
0:8:20,61 --> 0:8:26,73
So from the very beginning,
we had racial diversity.


212
0:8:26,73 --> 0:8:28,42
THOMAS MORTON: Now you guys
have referred to the Black


213
0:8:28,42 --> 0:8:31,68
Panthers and stuff
as a militia--


214
0:8:31,68 --> 0:8:36,19
not necessarily exactly the same
as you, but in the same


215
0:8:36,19 --> 0:8:37,535
spirit, in its early days.


216
0:8:37,535 --> 0:8:40,84



217
0:8:40,84 --> 0:8:43,299
NORMAN OLSON: Whether you sit
down with the Black Panthers


218
0:8:43,299 --> 0:8:45,76
or you sit down with the Native
Americans, I'm sure


219
0:8:45,76 --> 0:8:48,13
that we all want the
very same thing.


220
0:8:48,13 --> 0:8:51,88
RAY SOUTHWELL: So it's not the
black community that sees us


221
0:8:51,88 --> 0:8:53,6
as racists.


222
0:8:53,6 --> 0:8:58,33
It's the ignorant white
community, who are so quickly


223
0:8:58,33 --> 0:9:0,1
misled by the media.


224
0:9:0,1 --> 0:9:2,63
NORMAN OLSON: Who keeps
us divided?


225
0:9:2,63 --> 0:9:4,98
Remember we were talking about
control and power and central


226
0:9:4,98 --> 0:9:5,66
government?


227
0:9:5,66 --> 0:9:6,76
Of course.


228
0:9:6,76 --> 0:9:8,91
It's to the benefit of a central
government to keep us


229
0:9:8,91 --> 0:9:12,4
divided, to set up these
little target groups,


230
0:9:12,4 --> 0:9:16,12
marginalizing so that people
cannot come together, so that


231
0:9:16,12 --> 0:9:18,39
the power cannot be given
back to the people.


232
0:9:18,39 --> 0:9:20,95
As long as we're squabbling
among ourselves, we'll never


233
0:9:20,95 --> 0:9:24,41
be able to stand up against
tyranny and oppression.


234
0:9:24,41 --> 0:9:27,93
We'll be arguing with ourselves
while they march us


235
0:9:27,93 --> 0:9:29,7
into a trench to
machine-gun us.


236
0:9:29,7 --> 0:9:32,89



237
0:9:32,89 --> 0:9:36,6
It just doesn't make
any sense.


238
0:9:36,6 --> 0:9:37,85
Then it happened.


239
0:9:37,85 --> 0:9:39,68



240
0:9:39,68 --> 0:9:41,32
Boy, it all hit the fan.


241
0:9:41,32 --> 0:9:44,62
I'll tell you what.


242
0:9:44,62 --> 0:9:48,28
When Oklahoma City, that
event happened,


243
0:9:48,28 --> 0:9:50,14
it surprised everyone.


244
0:9:50,14 --> 0:9:52,81
I had heard rumors along the
Missouri border that there was


245
0:9:52,81 --> 0:9:55,6
going to be a bombing against
the federal building, either


246
0:9:55,6 --> 0:9:57,1
in Tulsa or in Oklahoma City.


247
0:9:57,1 --> 0:9:58,46
It was common knowledge.


248
0:9:58,46 --> 0:9:59,75
The Feds knew that.


249
0:9:59,75 --> 0:10:0,77
They knew it was going
to happen.


250
0:10:0,77 --> 0:10:2,4
They didn't know where.


251
0:10:2,4 --> 0:10:3,19
But when it happened,
it surprised


252
0:10:3,19 --> 0:10:4,67
everybody in the militia.


253
0:10:4,67 --> 0:10:7,68
I remember Leslie Stahl was in
the gun shop there when it all


254
0:10:7,68 --> 0:10:13,6
happened, and they made the
mention of Timothy McVeigh and


255
0:10:13,6 --> 0:10:14,59
the brothers, what
are their names?


256
0:10:14,59 --> 0:10:15,32
RAY SOUTHWELL: Nichols.


257
0:10:15,32 --> 0:10:16,3
NORMAN OLSON: Nichols.


258
0:10:16,3 --> 0:10:17,25
Terry Nichols.


259
0:10:17,25 --> 0:10:19,6
And they linked it with
the Michigan Militia.


260
0:10:19,6 --> 0:10:21,71
And then it all started
to unravel it.


261
0:10:21,71 --> 0:10:25,83
We deactivated after seven years
and started to go home.


262
0:10:25,83 --> 0:10:27,46
Some stayed.


263
0:10:27,46 --> 0:10:29,61
Some stayed.


264
0:10:29,61 --> 0:10:32,45
People got frightened then,
because the media picked up on


265
0:10:32,45 --> 0:10:37,31
it and ran with the militia
connection, to the extent that


266
0:10:37,31 --> 0:10:40,12
the militia, a third of the
militia ran and hid.


267
0:10:40,12 --> 0:10:41,26
A third of them went
underground.


268
0:10:41,26 --> 0:10:44,6
Didn't want to be seen, didn't
want to be on a list, didn't


269
0:10:44,6 --> 0:10:45,39
want to be photographed.


270
0:10:45,39 --> 0:10:47,4
Another third just quit the
militia altogether.


271
0:10:47,4 --> 0:10:49,67
They realized this wasn't
paintball in the


272
0:10:49,67 --> 0:10:50,5
woods on the weekend.


273
0:10:50,5 --> 0:10:52,67
This was life-and-death stuff.


274
0:10:52,67 --> 0:10:56,62
And another third became more
aggressive, more adamant about


275
0:10:56,62 --> 0:10:59,52
standing up against the
government, because we saw the


276
0:10:59,52 --> 0:11:3,29
conspiracy against it, against
what was happening.


277
0:11:3,29 --> 0:11:5,56
THOMAS MORTON: Do you think
there was ever a possibility


278
0:11:5,56 --> 0:11:11,84
that what happened in Oklahoma
and as a result of it could


279
0:11:11,84 --> 0:11:12,84
have been fully averted?


280
0:11:12,84 --> 0:11:14,34
Or was it just--


281
0:11:14,34 --> 0:11:16,57
NORMAN OLSON: Actually, I
believe it was the CIA.


282
0:11:16,57 --> 0:11:17,78
It sounds crazy.


283
0:11:17,78 --> 0:11:20,175
THOMAS MORTON: Well, the CIA's
done a lot of crazy things.


284
0:11:20,175 --> 0:11:21,15
NORMAN OLSON: Well,
listen to me.


285
0:11:21,15 --> 0:11:24,57
You know, when you talk about
neo-Nazis and skinheads and


286
0:11:24,57 --> 0:11:27,41
white supremacists,
which McVeigh was


287
0:11:27,41 --> 0:11:28,6
closely associated with--


288
0:11:28,6 --> 0:11:32,21
who's funding all
of that hatred?


289
0:11:32,21 --> 0:11:35,29
And if they could get a stooge
like Timothy McVeigh to do


290
0:11:35,29 --> 0:11:39,48
that, and Terry Nichols
collaborating?


291
0:11:39,48 --> 0:11:40,7
But what about the unknown?


292
0:11:40,7 --> 0:11:43,34
What about this fellow that
went back to Germany?


293
0:11:43,34 --> 0:11:47,66
I don't think it'll ever be
known, the extra leg they


294
0:11:47,66 --> 0:11:50,86
found in the rubble with the
military boot on it, that they


295
0:11:50,86 --> 0:11:52,6
couldn't match up to anybody.


296
0:11:52,6 --> 0:11:53,17
Where did that come from?


297
0:11:53,17 --> 0:11:55,66
You don't read about that,
but it was there.


298
0:11:55,66 --> 0:11:58,86
And so did they know
beforehand?


299
0:11:58,86 --> 0:12:1,59
Did somebody go in there
and set charges?


300
0:12:1,59 --> 0:12:2,36
I don't know.


301
0:12:2,36 --> 0:12:7,66
But I'm welcome to hear any
theory, because that's all I


302
0:12:7,66 --> 0:12:10,62
have, is a theory.


303
0:12:10,62 --> 0:12:14,38
There's something out
there, but I guess


304
0:12:14,38 --> 0:12:15,41
Fox Mulder was right.


305
0:12:15,41 --> 0:12:17,342
The truth is out there,
somewhere.


306
0:12:17,342 --> 0:12:20,46



307
0:12:20,46 --> 0:12:23,18
Did the federal government
stage the Oklahoma City


308
0:12:23,18 --> 0:12:26,23
bombing to bust up the militia
because the militia was


309
0:12:26,23 --> 0:12:29,28
growing too strong?


310
0:12:29,28 --> 0:12:30,15
That could be argued.


311
0:12:30,15 --> 0:12:33,8
And history may reveal it.


312
0:12:33,8 --> 0:12:33,75
I don't know.


313
0:12:33,75 --> 0:12:34,68
We think it did.


314
0:12:34,68 --> 0:12:37,79
We think that they had to stop
the militia because we were


315
0:12:37,79 --> 0:12:40,58
growing so fast across the
country that we were


316
0:12:40,58 --> 0:12:42,56
threatening to take the power
away from the federal


317
0:12:42,56 --> 0:12:43,3
government.


318
0:12:43,3 --> 0:12:44,0
THOMAS MORTON: Did
you personally


319
0:12:44,0 --> 0:12:45,2
meet Tim McVeigh before--


320
0:12:45,2 --> 0:12:46,59
NORMAN OLSON: No,
not personally.


321
0:12:46,59 --> 0:12:47,49
He was downstate.


322
0:12:47,49 --> 0:12:48,37
I was up north.


323
0:12:48,37 --> 0:12:50,11
I didn't get a chance
to meet him.


324
0:12:50,11 --> 0:12:52,42
Of course, the federal
government did a fine job of


325
0:12:52,42 --> 0:12:55,72
proving that Timothy McVeigh
was working out


326
0:12:55,72 --> 0:12:57,21
of an act of revenge.


327
0:12:57,21 --> 0:13:0,62
So when I went up to Washington
to testify before


328
0:13:0,62 --> 0:13:4,75
the Senate and got into that
pissing contest with Arlen


329
0:13:4,75 --> 0:13:7,23
Specter, I pointed
that out to him.


330
0:13:7,23 --> 0:13:10,31
And he couldn't understand how
I could understand what was


331
0:13:10,31 --> 0:13:12,57
going on in Timothy
McVeigh's mind.


332
0:13:12,57 --> 0:13:14,47
Well, you don't understand the
problem that we've had in


333
0:13:14,47 --> 0:13:15,16
Northern Ireland.


334
0:13:15,16 --> 0:13:16,7
You don't understand the problem
that we've had in


335
0:13:16,7 --> 0:13:17,35
South Africa.


336
0:13:17,35 --> 0:13:20,8
You do not understand the hatred
and retaliation, the


337
0:13:20,8 --> 0:13:22,39
retribution and the revenge that
has been going on around


338
0:13:22,39 --> 0:13:25,1
this globe since
time immortal.


339
0:13:25,1 --> 0:13:27,53
Then you don't understand
the dynamic, sir.


340
0:13:27,53 --> 0:13:30,86
ARLEN SPECTER: Well, Mr. Olson,
I may not understand.


341
0:13:30,86 --> 0:13:33,4
And that's why we've had these
hearings, so that you could


342
0:13:33,4 --> 0:13:35,8
have a full opportunity
to express yourself.


343
0:13:35,8 --> 0:13:37,69
NORMAN OLSON: I said well, it'd
be about as simple as I


344
0:13:37,69 --> 0:13:40,1
slap you, you slap me
in retaliation.


345
0:13:40,1 --> 0:13:40,26
OK?


346
0:13:40,26 --> 0:13:43,85
What don't we understand
about that?


347
0:13:43,85 --> 0:13:45,1
Of course, we tried to distance


348
0:13:45,1 --> 0:13:46,31
ourself from all of that.


349
0:13:46,31 --> 0:13:48,18
And we threw the meat in on the
other side of the river,


350
0:13:48,18 --> 0:13:51,38
claiming the Japanese did it,
but what happened was is that


351
0:13:51,38 --> 0:13:53,996
took all of the emphasis away
from us and headed it in


352
0:13:53,996 --> 0:13:54,71
another direction.


353
0:13:54,71 --> 0:13:58,562
Kind of dispersed that
whole feeling.


354
0:13:58,562 --> 0:14:1,53
And fear is strong.


355
0:14:1,53 --> 0:14:4,9
THOMAS MORTON: About the theory
that the Japanese were


356
0:14:4,9 --> 0:14:8,16
retaliating for the
sarin gas thing?


357
0:14:8,16 --> 0:14:9,85
NORMAN OLSON: No, we didn't have
any strong connection.


358
0:14:9,85 --> 0:14:10,98
We brought that out--


359
0:14:10,98 --> 0:14:16,41
actually, what it did
was it defused the


360
0:14:16,41 --> 0:14:17,55
direction we were going.


361
0:14:17,55 --> 0:14:19,82
Because we were going
headlong into a big


362
0:14:19,82 --> 0:14:21,84
confrontation with the Feds.


363
0:14:21,84 --> 0:14:24,9
They thought we were all
wacky and crazy.


364
0:14:24,9 --> 0:14:27,59
But that actually freed us up to
go in a different direction


365
0:14:27,59 --> 0:14:29,65
at that time, which we needed.


366
0:14:29,65 --> 0:14:35,42
And what may be thought of as
bad actually worked out good.


367
0:14:35,42 --> 0:14:38,74
Today, they laugh
at us and make--


368
0:14:38,74 --> 0:14:45,3
but it's a matter of strategic
decisions that we made.


369
0:14:45,3 --> 0:14:47,31
But things changed after
Oklahoma City, changed


370
0:14:47,31 --> 0:14:48,34
drastically.


371
0:14:48,34 --> 0:14:51,24
And a lot of people fell away.


372
0:14:51,24 --> 0:14:54,77
And then Bush came onto the
scene and everything got to be


373
0:14:54,77 --> 0:14:59,2
nice and the government was seen
to be a kind, friendly,


374
0:14:59,2 --> 0:15:2,86
benevolent government,
ready to help us.


375
0:15:2,86 --> 0:15:4,37
But that was just a facade.


376
0:15:4,37 --> 0:15:6,98
That was just a cover.


377
0:15:6,98 --> 0:15:8,605
They're not there to
help us at all.


378
0:15:8,605 --> 0:15:11,28
They're there to eke out our
substance and to rob us of


379
0:15:11,28 --> 0:15:13,14
everything that we have.


380
0:15:13,14 --> 0:15:16,2
And take away our power.


381
0:15:16,2 --> 0:15:17,86
So power to the people, huh?


382
0:15:17,86 --> 0:15:24,57



383
0:15:24,57 --> 0:15:27,86
Our job in Michigan was
pretty well done.


384
0:15:27,86 --> 0:15:29,87
THOMAS MORTON: Why did
you leave Michigan?


385
0:15:29,87 --> 0:15:31,99
And why did you pick Alaska?


386
0:15:31,99 --> 0:15:33,7
NORMAN OLSON: I often ask
people that question.


387
0:15:33,7 --> 0:15:35,82
Why did you come to Alaska?


388
0:15:35,82 --> 0:15:37,49
I'm always interested
where they come from


389
0:15:37,49 --> 0:15:39,29
and the reason why.


390
0:15:39,29 --> 0:15:42,62
And many people don't
really know.


391
0:15:42,62 --> 0:15:44,35
Something just drew them.


392
0:15:44,35 --> 0:15:46,75
I know that sounds ethereal
and all of that,


393
0:15:46,75 --> 0:15:48,5
but here's the thing.


394
0:15:48,5 --> 0:15:53,57
Alaska is a place, it's
a new frontier.


395
0:15:53,57 --> 0:15:57,19
I think socially, economically,
culturally there


396
0:15:57,19 --> 0:16:0,37
is much that appeals to us.


397
0:16:0,37 --> 0:16:1,86
We were in Michigan.


398
0:16:1,86 --> 0:16:4,74
Michigan, anybody who wants to
look at the statistics knows


399
0:16:4,74 --> 0:16:8,71
that Michigan is going bottom-up
economically.


400
0:16:8,71 --> 0:16:13,2
There was nothing there for
us, no reason to stay.


401
0:16:13,2 --> 0:16:17,6
And people had pretty well lost
their desire to stand up.


402
0:16:17,6 --> 0:16:21,23
I think the spirit of
resistance, the spirit of


403
0:16:21,23 --> 0:16:24,77
standing up against the
encroaching IRS and federal


404
0:16:24,77 --> 0:16:28,76
government intrusion into
people's lives had pretty well


405
0:16:28,76 --> 0:16:31,865
wasted away their spirit.


406
0:16:31,865 --> 0:16:35,3
And so they feel like leaving.


407
0:16:35,3 --> 0:16:39,2
We were on the tail-end of that,
and seeing it all come


408
0:16:39,2 --> 0:16:42,96
about, some of us came up here
for new adventures, new


409
0:16:42,96 --> 0:16:43,6
opportunities.


410
0:16:43,6 --> 0:16:49,0
Others came up here to leave
something behind.


411
0:16:49,0 --> 0:16:53,4
RAY SOUTHWELL: And it's the last
adventure state left in


412
0:16:53,4 --> 0:16:55,35
the union, as far as
I'm concerned.


413
0:16:55,35 --> 0:16:59,9
So I think that was probably
the big emphasis on


414
0:16:59,9 --> 0:17:1,13
why we moved up.


415
0:17:1,13 --> 0:17:3,16
NORMAN OLSON: This one was just
from a couple weeks ago,


416
0:17:3,16 --> 0:17:5,69
September 16.


417
0:17:5,69 --> 0:17:9,49
We are free from individual
income tax here.


418
0:17:9,49 --> 0:17:12,26
Much of the state is free
from sales tax.


419
0:17:12,26 --> 0:17:15,89
So there are many,
many benefits.


420
0:17:15,89 --> 0:17:17,66
THOMAS MORTON: It seems very
personal-liberty-oriented, and


421
0:17:17,66 --> 0:17:19,26
yet there's some odd
spots about it.


422
0:17:19,26 --> 0:17:24,599
I think the lack of sheriffs
in the entire state--


423
0:17:24,599 --> 0:17:29,51
how do you feel about Alaskan
state politics, in that sense?


424
0:17:29,51 --> 0:17:32,16
RAY SOUTHWELL: We had an
excellent working relationship


425
0:17:32,16 --> 0:17:34,36
in Michigan with our sheriff.


426
0:17:34,36 --> 0:17:38,44
I met with him on usually a
monthly basis to let him know


427
0:17:38,44 --> 0:17:41,54
when we were doing training,
where we were training.


428
0:17:41,54 --> 0:17:45,84
And officially, he could never
support us, you know, the


429
0:17:45,84 --> 0:17:47,73
politics involved with it.


430
0:17:47,73 --> 0:17:51,4
But he publicly came out and
told the community through the


431
0:17:51,4 --> 0:17:54,54
media that we were doing
nothing wrong.


432
0:17:54,54 --> 0:18:1,63
So the sheriff, as an elected
servant of the people, truly


433
0:18:1,63 --> 0:18:5,8
understands how to build that
relationship with the people.


434
0:18:5,8 --> 0:18:7,4
So we trusted him.


435
0:18:7,4 --> 0:18:8,96
NORMAN OLSON: You see, people
say, well, we can trust the


436
0:18:8,96 --> 0:18:9,81
Alaskan government.


437
0:18:9,81 --> 0:18:14,71
Well, I don't know how far
Alaska has sold out to the


438
0:18:14,71 --> 0:18:19,87
federals for whatever payment
is due for all that the


439
0:18:19,87 --> 0:18:22,92
federal government has
poured into Alaska.


440
0:18:22,92 --> 0:18:25,7
There's too many strings
attached to a lot of the


441
0:18:25,7 --> 0:18:27,33
bailouts and all
the rest of it.


442
0:18:27,33 --> 0:18:32,45
So I'm always concerned about
what liberties and what rights


443
0:18:32,45 --> 0:18:38,71
are at risk when we give the
promise of safety into the


444
0:18:38,71 --> 0:18:41,53
hands of governmental
authorities.


445
0:18:41,53 --> 0:18:44,1
I like to keep this liberty and
this freedom at the lowest


446
0:18:44,1 --> 0:18:44,94
level possible--


447
0:18:44,94 --> 0:18:47,4
among the citizens themselves.


448
0:18:47,4 --> 0:18:51,91
RAY SOUTHWELL: I think the other
part of this area, and


449
0:18:51,91 --> 0:18:55,9
probably throughout Alaska,
is our independence.


450
0:18:55,9 --> 0:18:58,33
And I was talking to one of
the local gun dealers.


451
0:18:58,33 --> 0:19:1,3
The peninsula has
50,000 people.


452
0:19:1,3 --> 0:19:4,7
And this particular one gun
dealer is selling 1,000


453
0:19:4,7 --> 0:19:7,9
military arms a month.


454
0:19:7,9 --> 0:19:11,87
So in the last month, or last
year, he has sold 12,000


455
0:19:11,87 --> 0:19:13,82
firearms to 50,000 people.


456
0:19:13,82 --> 0:19:16,31
So you can start seeing
those numbers.


457
0:19:16,31 --> 0:19:17,28
But what's happening--


458
0:19:17,28 --> 0:19:18,65
NORMAN OLSON: They're
upgrading.


459
0:19:18,65 --> 0:19:20,96
RAY SOUTHWELL: There's two
mindsets, I think, that are


460
0:19:20,96 --> 0:19:23,26
out there, is Alaskans'
independence.


461
0:19:23,26 --> 0:19:25,89
I can take care of myself
and my family.


462
0:19:25,89 --> 0:19:29,91
I will arm myself and I will
prepare for whatever may come,


463
0:19:29,91 --> 0:19:30,9
and I'll be ready.


464
0:19:30,9 --> 0:19:35,29
The other mindset is I am doing
that same issue, but I


465
0:19:35,29 --> 0:19:36,2
don't want anybody to know it.


466
0:19:36,2 --> 0:19:39,29
It's a secret, because the feds
might come and take my


467
0:19:39,29 --> 0:19:43,73
guns, or just a tremendous
amount of independence, but


468
0:19:43,73 --> 0:19:46,3
there's also a tremendous
amount of fear.


469
0:19:46,3 --> 0:19:53,22
What my fear is is that if and
when there's an economic


470
0:19:53,22 --> 0:19:55,53
disintegration, there's
going to be anarchy


471
0:19:55,53 --> 0:19:58,16
all over the country.


472
0:19:58,16 --> 0:20:0,6
THOMAS MORTON: Given the rate
at which things are going,


473
0:20:0,6 --> 0:20:3,7
does it concern you that militia
may not be ready?


474
0:20:3,7 --> 0:20:4,62
RAY SOUTHWELL: Yes.


475
0:20:4,62 --> 0:20:5,32
NORMAN OLSON: Oh, yes.


476
0:20:5,32 --> 0:20:5,65
RAY SOUTHWELL: Yeah.


477
0:20:5,65 --> 0:20:6,42
Yes.


478
0:20:6,42 --> 0:20:7,39
NORMAN OLSON: Too little,
too late.


479
0:20:7,39 --> 0:20:9,22
RAY SOUTHWELL: Yes.


480
0:20:9,22 --> 0:20:11,97
I foresee more anarchy.


481
0:20:11,97 --> 0:20:12,73
NORMAN OLSON: We're
very vulnerable.


482
0:20:12,73 --> 0:20:18,29
RAY SOUTHWELL: Neighbor fighting
neighbor for goods.


483
0:20:18,29 --> 0:20:19,36
NORMAN OLSON: There's
only two extremes--


484
0:20:19,36 --> 0:20:21,27
anarchy and tyranny.


485
0:20:21,27 --> 0:20:23,6
I'm concerned that we
are not networked.


486
0:20:23,6 --> 0:20:24,99
We are not prepared.


487
0:20:24,99 --> 0:20:27,4
We are very vulnerable
here in Alaska.


488
0:20:27,4 --> 0:20:29,38
One road in, one road out.


489
0:20:29,38 --> 0:20:33,2
The wise people will prepare
for what may be coming, and


490
0:20:33,2 --> 0:20:37,58
what we believe will come with
economic collapse, with social


491
0:20:37,58 --> 0:20:41,7
disruption, with more government
intrusion.


492
0:20:41,7 --> 0:20:46,77
So all we are doing is being
prudent, long-viewed people


493
0:20:46,77 --> 0:20:51,3
who are able to read the times,
prepare for the worst.


494
0:20:51,3 --> 0:20:54,8
It's as simple as that.


495
0:20:54,8 --> 0:20:57,6
And we still have some
pages to fill.


496
0:20:57,6 --> 0:21:0,97
Isn't that optimistic?


497
0:21:0,97 --> 0:21:2,98
If nothing else, you know, they
say at the end of your


498
0:21:2,98 --> 0:21:5,16
life, everything that you own is
either going to be put out


499
0:21:5,16 --> 0:21:6,76
by the side of the road,
auctioned off,


500
0:21:6,76 --> 0:21:8,4
or end up in a landfill.


501
0:21:8,4 --> 0:21:10,78
The only thing you can leave
your children is a legacy of


502
0:21:10,78 --> 0:21:12,54
who you were, what
you tried to do.


503
0:21:12,54 --> 0:21:15,38
If it's a life well spent doing
what you think is right,


504
0:21:15,38 --> 0:21:19,195
then can't argue with that.


505
0:21:19,195 --> 0:21:21,1
Just try and help the little
guy, you know?


506
0:21:21,1 --> 0:21:23,73
Help the little guy survive.


507
0:21:23,73 --> 0:21:26,1
There's a lot of folks out there
that are being chewed up


508
0:21:26,1 --> 0:21:28,54
by the system and need help.


509
0:21:28,54 --> 0:21:31,7
So we just keep on helping,
you know?


510
0:21:31,7 --> 0:21:35,24
Call us crazy, call us fanatics,
call us loons, but


511
0:21:35,24 --> 0:21:38,7
don't call us shortsighted.


512
0:21:38,7 --> 0:21:39,8
Trying to look far
enough ahead to


513
0:21:39,8 --> 0:21:41,905
prepare for what's coming.
