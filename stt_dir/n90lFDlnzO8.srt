2
0:0:5,445 --> 0:0:6,85
BILL ROHAN: Hey,
what's up guys?


3
0:0:6,85 --> 0:0:9,5
My name is Billy Rohan, and
we're here to show you today


4
0:0:9,5 --> 0:0:10,37
how to build a mini ramp.


5
0:0:10,37 --> 0:0:12,8
And we're going to be building
one that's 4 feet


6
0:0:12,8 --> 0:0:13,71
high and 12 feet wide.


7
0:0:13,71 --> 0:0:16,2
You want to have a good hammer
to start out with.


8
0:0:16,2 --> 0:0:19,78
You can find all these tools
at Home Depot or Lowes.


9
0:0:19,78 --> 0:0:22,82
An impact drill is going to be
key, especially if you're


10
0:0:22,82 --> 0:0:24,52
drilling the ramps together.


11
0:0:24,52 --> 0:0:27,69
You're also going to want to
have a jigsaw for cutting the


12
0:0:27,69 --> 0:0:28,88
transitions.


13
0:0:28,88 --> 0:0:32,8
Also, very important is to
have your Skilsaw because


14
0:0:32,8 --> 0:0:35,22
you're going to cut a lot of
2x4s when you're building a


15
0:0:35,22 --> 0:0:37,32
mini ramp, so you definitely
are going


16
0:0:37,32 --> 0:0:38,56
to need one of these.


17
0:0:38,56 --> 0:0:41,75
Also very key is
a tape measure.


18
0:0:41,75 --> 0:0:43,86
You want to have a good
assortment of drill bits.


19
0:0:43,86 --> 0:0:44,87
This is a level.


20
0:0:44,87 --> 0:0:47,37
You want to be on the level
when you're building, so


21
0:0:47,37 --> 0:0:48,75
that's really important.


22
0:0:48,75 --> 0:0:50,72
What this is called
is a chalk line.


23
0:0:50,72 --> 0:0:54,21
And the chalk line is used so
that when you put your 2x4s in


24
0:0:54,21 --> 0:0:57,14
later in the building process
you'll be able to see where


25
0:0:57,14 --> 0:0:58,95
they are under the plywood.


26
0:0:58,95 --> 0:1:1,16
It's good to have a pretty
heavy duty pencil.


27
0:1:1,16 --> 0:1:2,82
I got this one from Team Pain.


28
0:1:2,82 --> 0:1:6,0
But you're going to be writing
on wood, so a standard pencil


29
0:1:6,0 --> 0:1:6,59
isn't good.


30
0:1:6,59 --> 0:1:8,34
This is a carpenters pencil.


31
0:1:8,34 --> 0:1:11,56
Next up, your actual
wood supplies.


32
0:1:11,56 --> 0:1:14,6
So whether you're building
a 12-foot-wide ramp or a


33
0:1:14,6 --> 0:1:18,18
24-foot-wide ramp, you're
generally going to use plywood


34
0:1:18,18 --> 0:1:21,47
and 2x4s for your most
standard ramps.


35
0:1:21,47 --> 0:1:23,99
Our ramp we're going to build
in an 8-foot section and a


36
0:1:23,99 --> 0:1:27,5
4-foot section and combine
the two later.


37
0:1:27,5 --> 0:1:31,3
So right here we had to measure
the length of the 2x4s


38
0:1:31,3 --> 0:1:33,2
along with the transitions.


39
0:1:33,2 --> 0:1:35,81
So it's really important that
your 2x4 goes to the


40
0:1:35,81 --> 0:1:40,195
transition, and the distance
between the two is 8 feet or 4


41
0:1:40,195 --> 0:1:41,86
feet, depending on
the sections that


42
0:1:41,86 --> 0:1:43,29
you're going to build.


43
0:1:43,29 --> 0:1:46,24
A lot of people, they'll use
string and a pencil and try to


44
0:1:46,24 --> 0:1:49,8
run it from one end to the other
and come up with a nice


45
0:1:49,8 --> 0:1:51,35
circumference, but that's
actually not the


46
0:1:51,35 --> 0:1:52,63
best way to do it.


47
0:1:52,63 --> 0:1:54,76
I'm going to introduce
you to Curtis here.


48
0:1:54,76 --> 0:1:57,665
Curtis is getting ready to build
a transition right now.


49
0:1:57,665 --> 0:1:59,39
CURTIS RAPP: On this particular
ramp, we're going


50
0:1:59,39 --> 0:2:1,3
to do a 7-foot transition.


51
0:2:1,3 --> 0:2:4,55
So put one screw in the
middle at 7 feet.


52
0:2:4,55 --> 0:2:7,98
So this whole 2x4 is going
to pivot at that point.


53
0:2:7,98 --> 0:2:11,25
Drill a hole, the pencil's going
to fit right in there.


54
0:2:11,25 --> 0:2:15,55
And so you started out at 3
and 1/2 inches, that's the


55
0:2:15,55 --> 0:2:18,58
height of the 2x4 that's going
to be at the bottom.


56
0:2:18,58 --> 0:2:21,79
Mark it out, get your pencil
in there, and then you just


57
0:2:21,79 --> 0:2:22,45
drag it along.


58
0:2:22,45 --> 0:2:27,166
It just pivots nice
and perfect, yeah.


59
0:2:27,166 --> 0:2:30,659
You've got a perfect tranny.


60
0:2:30,659 --> 0:2:32,156
BILL ROHAN: There you go.


61
0:2:32,156 --> 0:2:36,647
It's about to drop.


62
0:2:36,647 --> 0:2:40,94
To save yourself some money,
just flip it on to the other


63
0:2:40,94 --> 0:2:44,58
side and then you would
trace over it.


64
0:2:44,58 --> 0:2:47,27
So the next step in building a
ramp, you're going to want to


65
0:2:47,27 --> 0:2:49,4
mark the transitions.


66
0:2:49,4 --> 0:2:53,73
The standard is usually every
8 inches, but since we're


67
0:2:53,73 --> 0:2:56,276
doing this as a temporary ramp,
we're going to do it


68
0:2:56,276 --> 0:2:57,7
every foot.


69
0:2:57,7 --> 0:3:0,15
So you're going to start out
with the bottom one.


70
0:3:0,15 --> 0:3:3,8
You want to make sure that
these are level.


71
0:3:3,8 --> 0:3:7,1
When you go to put in, that
this is flush with this.


72
0:3:7,1 --> 0:3:10,47



73
0:3:10,47 --> 0:3:14,9
Anytime you're going to put in
a 2x4 into plywood, you want


74
0:3:14,9 --> 0:3:16,9
at least two screws.


75
0:3:16,9 --> 0:3:18,58
Most people use three when
they're building a ramp,


76
0:3:18,58 --> 0:3:21,6
especially if it's going
to be more permanent.


77
0:3:21,6 --> 0:3:23,2
So we're going to go ahead and
use three in this, even though


78
0:3:23,2 --> 0:3:24,45
it's temporary.


79
0:3:24,45 --> 0:3:26,86



80
0:3:26,86 --> 0:3:28,94
You always want to start with
your front and back so that


81
0:3:28,94 --> 0:3:32,72
the rest of the 2x4s
fit in well.


82
0:3:32,72 --> 0:3:36,402
Now, this is where the lines
come in that we drew.


83
0:3:36,402 --> 0:3:38,79
The reason that we drew those
lines is so that we don't have


84
0:3:38,79 --> 0:3:42,58
to measure it every single time
we put in a new support.


85
0:3:42,58 --> 0:3:45,95
Since we're going every foot
instead of every 8 inches,


86
0:3:45,95 --> 0:3:50,425
it's good to use two 2x4s every
other one so that way


87
0:3:50,425 --> 0:3:52,1
you have extra support.


88
0:3:52,1 --> 0:3:54,51
All right, so since the ramp
we're building is 12 feet


89
0:3:54,51 --> 0:3:57,13
wide, we're building
two sections.


90
0:3:57,13 --> 0:4:0,41
Our section that we just worked
on is 8 feet wide, this


91
0:4:0,41 --> 0:4:2,57
section's 4 feet--


92
0:4:2,57 --> 0:4:3,97
4 plus 8 is 12.


93
0:4:3,97 --> 0:4:5,75
So this is the flat bottom.


94
0:4:5,75 --> 0:4:9,4
It's really a very basic
bit of carpentry.


95
0:4:9,4 --> 0:4:13,4
You take a 2x4 on either side,
you square it out to a box so


96
0:4:13,4 --> 0:4:16,64
you'd have one, two, three,
and then four.


97
0:4:16,64 --> 0:4:18,89
In this ramp we're going
to use 8 feet of flat.


98
0:4:18,89 --> 0:4:22,25
Some ramps are smaller flat
if they are tighter.


99
0:4:22,25 --> 0:4:23,4
It depends how you like it.


100
0:4:23,4 --> 0:4:26,12
If you like it with a lot of
flat, like we do, it gives you


101
0:4:26,12 --> 0:4:27,73
more time for setting up.


102
0:4:27,73 --> 0:4:30,55
So we're going to have 8 foot
of flat on this ramp.


103
0:4:30,55 --> 0:4:33,24
So when you start your flat
bottom, you're going to start


104
0:4:33,24 --> 0:4:34,48
with a rectangle.


105
0:4:34,48 --> 0:4:38,97
It's going to be 4 feet long
here, and 93 inches here.


106
0:4:38,97 --> 0:4:42,48
On your middle section your 2x4s
are going to be 45 inches


107
0:4:42,48 --> 0:4:46,62
long, so they're different sized
2x4s than the outside.


108
0:4:46,62 --> 0:4:49,52
And you want these 2x4s
to be every 8 inches.


109
0:4:49,52 --> 0:4:50,24
This is the coping.


110
0:4:50,24 --> 0:4:53,81
This is the most essential
part of the mini ramp.


111
0:4:53,81 --> 0:4:56,82
This is a 24-foot piece
of coping, and our


112
0:4:56,82 --> 0:4:57,95
ramp's 12 feet wide.


113
0:4:57,95 --> 0:5:0,99
So we're going to cut the coping
in half and use one on


114
0:5:0,99 --> 0:5:1,96
each side of the ramp.


115
0:5:1,96 --> 0:5:5,8
Whenever you're going to cut
coping, you have to have a


116
0:5:5,8 --> 0:5:7,7
metal bit for your saw.


117
0:5:7,7 --> 0:5:9,51
You can't use the same one as
the wood or it will destroy


118
0:5:9,51 --> 0:5:10,983
the saw and the bit.


119
0:5:10,983 --> 0:5:13,92
You always want to make sure
also that your coping is 2


120
0:5:13,92 --> 0:5:15,6
inches at least.


121
0:5:15,6 --> 0:5:17,58
You don't want anything
smaller than 2 inches.


122
0:5:17,58 --> 0:5:20,855
It's a really good size for your
trucks to lock into for


123
0:5:20,855 --> 0:5:23,36
smith grinds and stuff
like that.


124
0:5:23,36 --> 0:5:26,85
CURTIS RAPP: All right,
so this is our deck.


125
0:5:26,85 --> 0:5:31,18
The deck is just what you're
going to stand on, and some


126
0:5:31,18 --> 0:5:31,83
people do 2 feet.


127
0:5:31,83 --> 0:5:32,73
I like 4 feet.


128
0:5:32,73 --> 0:5:35,15
You can get some
standing room.


129
0:5:35,15 --> 0:5:37,865
They're not exactly the same
as the flat bottom.


130
0:5:37,865 --> 0:5:40,77
They're a little smaller because
they've got to fit in


131
0:5:40,77 --> 0:5:42,18
between the templates.


132
0:5:42,18 --> 0:5:48,415
What you do is you make it 94
and 1/2 inches so it fits


133
0:5:48,415 --> 0:5:51,17
in-between the template
and can butt up


134
0:5:51,17 --> 0:5:52,425
right against the coping.


135
0:5:52,425 --> 0:5:55,17
There's going to be 4 feet from
the coping, plywood will


136
0:5:55,17 --> 0:5:56,59
fit right on top.


137
0:5:56,59 --> 0:5:58,41
Put the studs every 16 inches.


138
0:5:58,41 --> 0:6:0,81
There's going to be 3/4-inch
plywood on it.


139
0:6:0,81 --> 0:6:1,665
That's it.


140
0:6:1,665 --> 0:6:3,9
BILL ROHAN: So there you go.


141
0:6:3,9 --> 0:6:5,2
We got the skeleton
ready to go.


142
0:6:5,2 --> 0:6:7,55
And we're going to continue to
put the skin and the other


143
0:6:7,55 --> 0:6:8,895
layers on at the
next location.


144
0:6:8,895 --> 0:6:27,78



145
0:6:27,78 --> 0:6:29,83
All right, so we got here to the
spot, and we're having to


146
0:6:29,83 --> 0:6:30,89
build on a slope.


147
0:6:30,89 --> 0:6:34,74
So we have to build a false
floor first, and then once


148
0:6:34,74 --> 0:6:37,17
we're done with that then we can
get started with the ramp.


149
0:6:37,17 --> 0:6:39,96
So it'll be a little bit of a
mission, but it should take


150
0:6:39,96 --> 0:6:42,109
about an hour or two to
finish up, I hope.


151
0:6:42,109 --> 0:7:3,14



152
0:7:3,14 --> 0:7:5,24
All right, so right now we're
getting the other two


153
0:7:5,24 --> 0:7:8,21
transitions to connect it to
the flat bottom, and then


154
0:7:8,21 --> 0:7:10,42
we'll be able to start
plying this ramp.


155
0:7:10,42 --> 0:7:13,32
It's really important when
you're getting to this part of


156
0:7:13,32 --> 0:7:15,67
building the mini ramp where you
connect the transitions to


157
0:7:15,67 --> 0:7:18,73
the flat bottom that
it's all level.


158
0:7:18,73 --> 0:7:20,11
So you want to push it up.


159
0:7:20,11 --> 0:7:21,47
You guys can push this up.


160
0:7:21,47 --> 0:7:24,87
When you push it up, then you're
going to screw in right


161
0:7:24,87 --> 0:7:28,48
there from the transition
to the flat bottom.


162
0:7:28,48 --> 0:7:31,73



163
0:7:31,73 --> 0:7:35,286
You do about four of them in
there and you should be good.


164
0:7:35,286 --> 0:7:38,75
How these 2x4s made a transition
and a flat bottom,


165
0:7:38,75 --> 0:7:42,86
there's a line that's a perfect
guide for your plywood


166
0:7:42,86 --> 0:7:44,195
to match up with.


167
0:7:44,195 --> 0:7:45,64
And that's when you
start using the


168
0:7:45,64 --> 0:7:48,35
2-inch screws for shooting.


169
0:7:48,35 --> 0:7:50,63
Every sheet's going to have
at least four screws--


170
0:7:50,63 --> 0:7:54,91
four screws on each
rim going across.


171
0:7:54,91 --> 0:7:58,91
When you put your transition
first layer up to the flat


172
0:7:58,91 --> 0:8:1,51
bottom layer, you
can stand on it.


173
0:8:1,51 --> 0:8:4,43
And you always want to work from
the bottom up so that it


174
0:8:4,43 --> 0:8:6,36
doesn't get warped
in the middle.


175
0:8:6,36 --> 0:8:10,5
So you just start with your
first 2x4, second 2x4, third


176
0:8:10,5 --> 0:8:14,765
on up so that it bends with the
wood rather than starting


177
0:8:14,765 --> 0:8:16,37
on the top and going down.


178
0:8:16,37 --> 0:8:18,39
You want to basically have
a screw at least every


179
0:8:18,39 --> 0:8:19,95
foot on your ply.


180
0:8:19,95 --> 0:8:26,212



181
0:8:26,212 --> 0:8:29,54
So now we're moving into our
second layer of ply.


182
0:8:29,54 --> 0:8:33,929
A lot of people try to get away
with using less wood, but


183
0:8:33,929 --> 0:8:36,64
it's good to use a 1/2-inch
sheet of ply, and then another


184
0:8:36,64 --> 0:8:38,61
1/2-inch sheet of ply.


185
0:8:38,61 --> 0:8:40,875
And then your third layer,
whether it's Masonite Indoors,


186
0:8:40,875 --> 0:8:43,62
or Ramp Armor, or
whatever it is.


187
0:8:43,62 --> 0:8:46,27
But it's good to have three
layers so that you don't break


188
0:8:46,27 --> 0:8:47,61
through and then
hurt yourself.


189
0:8:47,61 --> 0:8:49,59
So you want to start on the
flat bottom and then


190
0:8:49,59 --> 0:8:50,652
work your way up.


191
0:8:50,652 --> 0:8:54,87
Our top piece here is going to
16 inches because we put our


192
0:8:54,87 --> 0:8:57,88
center piece 24 inches
on either side.


193
0:8:57,88 --> 0:9:1,72
So on our second layer we used
a sheet of plywood in the


194
0:9:1,72 --> 0:9:3,25
exact middle of the ramp.


195
0:9:3,25 --> 0:9:6,19
You don't want it to follow
seam-over-seam.


196
0:9:6,19 --> 0:9:9,38
And so you could layer it
seam-over-seam which a lot of


197
0:9:9,38 --> 0:9:12,33
people do, but it's not going
to be as solid of a ramp.


198
0:9:12,33 --> 0:9:17,25
So if you change the structure
of the plys so that they don't


199
0:9:17,25 --> 0:9:19,41
go over each other, you're
going to have a


200
0:9:19,41 --> 0:9:21,14
much stronger ramp.


201
0:9:21,14 --> 0:9:23,18
So this is the platform
we built yesterday.


202
0:9:23,18 --> 0:9:25,98
We just slid it in, make sure
it's flush with your


203
0:9:25,98 --> 0:9:28,615
transition, and then give it a
couple of screws in there.


204
0:9:28,615 --> 0:9:31,69
You want to make sure that it's
level as well so that


205
0:9:31,69 --> 0:9:34,1
your platform isn't sitting
at an angle.


206
0:9:34,1 --> 0:9:37,0
And then once you get it locked
to the transition, you


207
0:9:37,0 --> 0:9:40,605
put a couple 2x4s in and then
screw those into the corners


208
0:9:40,605 --> 0:9:42,43
so that it's supported well.


209
0:9:42,43 --> 0:9:45,46
When you go to put your screw in
for the coping, you want to


210
0:9:45,46 --> 0:9:47,11
have a longer drill bit.


211
0:9:47,11 --> 0:9:49,6
Usually about 6 inches
will be good.


212
0:9:49,6 --> 0:9:55,36



213
0:9:55,36 --> 0:9:57,86
So the reason you put a smaller
screw there-- that's a


214
0:9:57,86 --> 0:10:1,1
3/8 size bit--


215
0:10:1,1 --> 0:10:4,17
is so that the screw head
doesn't go through as well.


216
0:10:4,17 --> 0:10:6,23
All right, so it's a total of
eight holes that you have to


217
0:10:6,23 --> 0:10:7,91
drill into the coping.


218
0:10:7,91 --> 0:10:11,3
We do one every three feet, so
we do four holes that you


219
0:10:11,3 --> 0:10:13,6
actually are putting
the screws into.


220
0:10:13,6 --> 0:10:15,93
The other four holes are
countersinked so that the


221
0:10:15,93 --> 0:10:18,39
screw heads go through
the coping.


222
0:10:18,39 --> 0:10:20,62
All right, so we're almost
finished with our second


223
0:10:20,62 --> 0:10:23,28
layer, and then we're going to
move on to our third layer


224
0:10:23,28 --> 0:10:25,9
which is the Ramp Armor.


225
0:10:25,9 --> 0:10:27,49
Ramp Armor is a composite
material.


226
0:10:27,49 --> 0:10:31,43
It's super strong and also very
smooth, so it's perfect.


227
0:10:31,43 --> 0:10:33,42
It's made for skate ramps.


228
0:10:33,42 --> 0:10:36,687
On this one I like to start at
the top with it right up to


229
0:10:36,687 --> 0:10:39,93
the coping because it's easy
for it to slide down.


230
0:10:39,93 --> 0:10:41,97
But if it's your third
layer, it's usually


231
0:10:41,97 --> 0:10:43,22
going to be all right.


232
0:10:43,22 --> 0:10:50,646



233
0:10:50,646 --> 0:10:53,0
All right, so these guys are
finishing up the deck.


234
0:10:53,0 --> 0:10:56,23
You want 3/4-inch ply when
you're decking the ramp,


235
0:10:56,23 --> 0:10:57,89
because you don't want
to fall through it.


236
0:10:57,89 --> 0:10:59,78
You're going to have all you and
your friends standing on


237
0:10:59,78 --> 0:11:2,42
it, so it's good to get
real thick plywood.


238
0:11:2,42 --> 0:11:4,686
Even 1 inch thick is fine for
the deck because you're not


239
0:11:4,686 --> 0:11:5,936
bending it.


240
0:11:5,936 --> 0:11:17,53



241
0:11:17,53 --> 0:11:18,9
So this is the finished
product.


242
0:11:18,9 --> 0:11:21,4
We got the ramp done and
we ended up having


243
0:11:21,4 --> 0:11:21,91
it done a day early.


244
0:11:21,91 --> 0:11:23,88
So we're all really
excited about it.


245
0:11:23,88 --> 0:11:25,96
Now the best part is
we get to skate it.


246
0:11:25,96 --> 0:11:28,56
Also check with your neighbors
and make sure you have an epic


247
0:11:28,56 --> 0:11:30,12
party to celebrate
your new ramp.


248
0:11:30,12 --> 0:12:24,12



249
0:12:24,12 --> 0:12:25,37
MALE SPEAKER: Is
that all right?


250
0:12:25,37 --> 0:12:30,42



251
0:12:30,42 --> 0:12:31,92
MALE SPEAKER: It looks good.


252
0:12:31,92 --> 0:12:32,82
MALE SPEAKER: Sweet.


253
0:12:32,82 --> 0:12:34,32
Well done.


254
0:12:34,32 --> 0:12:34,92
MALE SPEAKER: I'm psyched.


255
0:12:34,92 --> 0:12:36,17
I'm so psyched, dude.


256
0:12:36,17 --> 0:14:36,17
