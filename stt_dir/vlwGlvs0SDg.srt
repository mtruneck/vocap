1
0:0:11,5 --> 0:0:13,9
>> Right now it is my pleasure


2
0:0:13,9 --> 0:0:17,8
to introduce our luncheon
speaker today George P. Bush.


3
0:0:17,8 --> 0:0:19,14
George is a partner in
Pennybacker Capital.


4
0:0:19,14 --> 0:0:20,86
I can give you a little
bit of his background


5
0:0:20,86 --> 0:0:22,99
and I'm sure he'll fill
you in with some more.


6
0:0:22,99 --> 0:0:26,22
He received his bachelor's
degree from Rice University


7
0:0:26,22 --> 0:0:28,22
and then he's also a UT Alum.


8
0:0:28,22 --> 0:0:30,26
He graduated from the law school


9
0:0:30,26 --> 0:0:33,66
with his JD here
at, from UT Austin.


10
0:0:33,66 --> 0:0:37,12
Prior to joining Pennybacker, he
practiced law with Akin, Gump,


11
0:0:37,12 --> 0:0:40,97
Strauss, Hauer and Feld doing
corporate and securities law,


12
0:0:40,97 --> 0:0:43,8
and before that he
clerked in Dallas


13
0:0:43,8 --> 0:0:46,64
for federal district
Judge Sidney Fitzwater


14
0:0:46,64 --> 0:0:49,33
who I also clerked for so
we know each other that way.


15
0:0:49,33 --> 0:0:51,23
It's my pleasure to
introduce George P. Bush.


16
0:0:51,23 --> 0:0:53,35
As you all know, he comes
from a family with a long


17
0:0:53,35 --> 0:0:56,31
and storied tradition of
public service and he continues


18
0:0:56,31 --> 0:0:59,44
that as a naval reserves
intelligence officer


19
0:0:59,44 --> 0:1:2,71
and he recently was
mobilized to Afghanistan


20
0:1:2,71 --> 0:1:4,54
and I'm sure he'll tell us a
little bit about that as well.


21
0:1:4,54 --> 0:1:5,9
So please join in
welcoming George P. Bush.


22
0:1:5,9 --> 0:1:5,97
[applause]


23
0:1:5,97 --> 0:1:11,85
>> Thank you Ronnie [assumed
spelling], I appreciate it.


24
0:1:11,85 --> 0:1:16,2
Thank you Ronnie and thank you
for what you do for Subiendo.


25
0:1:16,2 --> 0:1:17,2
The very little that I know


26
0:1:17,2 --> 0:1:19,48
about the organization
I've been blown away


27
0:1:19,48 --> 0:1:21,89
with what you guys are
accomplishing this week.


28
0:1:21,89 --> 0:1:25,6
I wouldn't be surprised if
there's a future president in,


29
0:1:25,6 --> 0:1:27,89
in this room and I'm I'm
really delighted to to get


30
0:1:27,89 --> 0:1:31,68
to know y'all and my hope
is that you guys can think


31
0:1:31,68 --> 0:1:34,21
of any questions that
you might have for me,


32
0:1:34,21 --> 0:1:38,2
any comments you might have
about the Bush family that you'd


33
0:1:38,2 --> 0:1:42,18
like to share, and any any kind
of stories you'd like me to kind


34
0:1:42,18 --> 0:1:45,27
of focus on because I really
wanted this to be interactive


35
0:1:45,27 --> 0:1:48,33
and about you guys and
maximizing the time


36
0:1:48,33 --> 0:1:49,54
that you guys have here


37
0:1:49,54 --> 0:1:52,41
on the beautiful campus
University of Texas in Austin.


38
0:1:52,41 --> 0:1:55,89
When I was asked to talk a
little bit about leadership,


39
0:1:55,89 --> 0:1:59,84
I I wanted to talk a little bit
about my personal experiences


40
0:1:59,84 --> 0:2:1,88
and I want to first
say at the outset


41
0:2:1,88 --> 0:2:4,55
that I'm a truly blessed kid


42
0:2:4,55 --> 0:2:7,8
to be born into,
into the Bush family.


43
0:2:7,8 --> 0:2:9,2
When I was 12 years old,


44
0:2:9,2 --> 0:2:12,43
my grandfather was
first elected president


45
0:2:12,43 --> 0:2:15,74
after Ronald Reagan left office.


46
0:2:15,74 --> 0:2:18,27
But right before he was
sworn in as president


47
0:2:18,27 --> 0:2:21,87
of the United States I
was asked to join with a,


48
0:2:21,87 --> 0:2:24,17
a group called Americares
which is one


49
0:2:24,17 --> 0:2:26,89
of the largest non-for profit
organizations in the world,


50
0:2:26,89 --> 0:2:28,93
and they deliver needed supplies


51
0:2:28,93 --> 0:2:32,48
to to disaster recovery
efforts throughout the world.


52
0:2:32,48 --> 0:2:36,13
And I don't know if you recall
but in 1992 there was one


53
0:2:36,13 --> 0:2:38,69
of the largest earthquakes
recorded in human history


54
0:2:38,69 --> 0:2:43,93
in Armenia which was a former
soviet republic or a republic


55
0:2:43,93 --> 0:2:46,48
within kind of the shield of
the sov- former Soviet Union.


56
0:2:46,48 --> 0:2:51,51
And I was asked at the age of
12 years to fly in a cargo plane


57
0:2:51,51 --> 0:2:53,98
with the first supplies
to to Armenia


58
0:2:53,98 --> 0:2:59,2
to deliver much needed supplies
to kids of of that were victims


59
0:2:59,2 --> 0:3:1,68
of the earthquake and I
was totally blown away


60
0:3:1,68 --> 0:3:2,67
by the experience.


61
0:3:2,67 --> 0:3:5,48
This was a very desolate
area of the world.


62
0:3:5,48 --> 0:3:8,69
50,000 people died,
most of whom died


63
0:3:8,69 --> 0:3:11,26
under the rubble while they
were waiting for supplies


64
0:3:11,26 --> 0:3:13,2
that we were attempting
to deliver.


65
0:3:13,2 --> 0:3:16,5
The Soviets themselves were
unable to deliver these supplies


66
0:3:16,5 --> 0:3:20,73
to to their own people and yet
we at Americans at the height


67
0:3:20,73 --> 0:3:23,71
of the cold war we were
the first ones delivering


68
0:3:23,71 --> 0:3:24,77
these supplies.


69
0:3:24,77 --> 0:3:28,26
And I'll never forget going
to a children's hospital


70
0:3:28,26 --> 0:3:30,58
where a 5th grade class was,


71
0:3:30,58 --> 0:3:34,9
was sitting in class
learning their their cl-


72
0:3:34,9 --> 0:3:36,62
learning their their
instruction for the day


73
0:3:36,62 --> 0:3:38,1
and the earthquake taking place


74
0:3:38,1 --> 0:3:40,52
and over half of
the students died.


75
0:3:40,52 --> 0:3:43,76
And one kid that I met
survived that rubble,


76
0:3:43,76 --> 0:3:46,86
survived during his time in the
rumble after the earthquake.


77
0:3:46,86 --> 0:3:51,12
He had lost several limbs
and I delivered him a bible


78
0:3:51,12 --> 0:3:54,26
because this was a
religious school.


79
0:3:54,26 --> 0:3:56,65
And the kid cried and he told
me this is the best Christmas he


80
0:3:56,65 --> 0:3:57,83
ever had.


81
0:3:57,83 --> 0:4:1,0
And to me at a young age,
at the age of 12 to to have


82
0:4:1,0 --> 0:4:3,34
that perspective of
what the true meaning


83
0:4:3,34 --> 0:4:7,38
of Christmas was all about
was, was mind-blowing.


84
0:4:7,38 --> 0:4:9,16
Following that, when my
grandfather was in office,


85
0:4:9,16 --> 0:4:10,93
I had a chance to live
in the white house


86
0:4:10,93 --> 0:4:12,47
which was pretty cool.


87
0:4:12,47 --> 0:4:15,28
You know Dwight D. [inaudible]
President Eisenhower built a


88
0:4:15,28 --> 0:4:18,44
bowling alley in the in the
basement of the white house.


89
0:4:18,44 --> 0:4:21,28
There's also the rose
garden where you know some


90
0:4:21,28 --> 0:4:23,3
of my favorite professional
athletes,


91
0:4:23,3 --> 0:4:24,83
you know when they win the
championship they always go


92
0:4:24,83 --> 0:4:27,12
and say hello to the
president, deliver a jersey,


93
0:4:27,12 --> 0:4:29,61
so that was pretty
cool getting getting


94
0:4:29,61 --> 0:4:32,82
to know professional athletes
and getting their autographs.


95
0:4:32,82 --> 0:4:34,93
But my grandmother,
for those of you


96
0:4:34,93 --> 0:4:37,75
who may not know Barbara
Bush, kind of the silver fox


97
0:4:37,75 --> 0:4:41,51
of the Bush family, wears the
pants if you will [laughter].


98
0:4:41,51 --> 0:4:43,6
She's kind of the boss.


99
0:4:43,6 --> 0:4:46,2
She made sure that none of
us as grandkids were spoiled


100
0:4:46,2 --> 0:4:50,25
so she wanted us to go
work at a at a soup kitchen


101
0:4:50,25 --> 0:4:53,14
which I did during the time
that I lived in the white house.


102
0:4:53,14 --> 0:4:57,44
And again, at the young age of
14, learned tremendous amount


103
0:4:57,44 --> 0:5:1,16
about about those that
are less fortunate in one


104
0:5:1,16 --> 0:5:2,77
of the poorest areas
of our country.


105
0:5:2,77 --> 0:5:9,1
When my uncle was elected to
office from 2000 and and served


106
0:5:9,1 --> 0:5:10,98
until 2008, I had the chance


107
0:5:10,98 --> 0:5:15,2
to join three American
delegations throughout the world


108
0:5:15,2 --> 0:5:19,59
and I had a chance to see more
perspectives, more perspectives


109
0:5:19,59 --> 0:5:21,5
than most kids my age.


110
0:5:21,5 --> 0:5:24,95
Probably the most powerful
experience was getting to go


111
0:5:24,95 --> 0:5:28,37
to Nicaragua, Nicaragua
for those that are,


112
0:5:28,37 --> 0:5:29,49
for a different accent,


113
0:5:29,49 --> 0:5:33,71
but during the first
peaceful transfer of power


114
0:5:33,71 --> 0:5:37,3
in that country's history
following a president


115
0:5:37,3 --> 0:5:40,96
by the name of Chamorro
where during her swearing in,


116
0:5:40,96 --> 0:5:42,84
the inauguration
had to be called off


117
0:5:42,84 --> 0:5:44,27
because of violence basically,


118
0:5:44,27 --> 0:5:47,97
threats of of of
her assassination.


119
0:5:47,97 --> 0:5:50,85
And so we, the the new
president that was sworn


120
0:5:50,85 --> 0:5:54,39
in was President Bolanos and
being in a foreign country


121
0:5:54,39 --> 0:5:57,42
and following the
American flag to the podium


122
0:5:57,42 --> 0:5:59,16
in which the American
delegation sat


123
0:5:59,16 --> 0:6:1,6
down behind the newly
sworn president


124
0:6:1,6 --> 0:6:6,6
in the first peaceful transfer
of power was an amazing moment,


125
0:6:6,6 --> 0:6:8,95
especially when half the
crowd was booing the US.


126
0:6:8,95 --> 0:6:12,48
It really puts things in
perspective in terms of,


127
0:6:12,48 --> 0:6:16,74
in terms of of being patriotic
and supporting your country.


128
0:6:16,74 --> 0:6:19,8
The point of all these
stories that I wanted


129
0:6:19,8 --> 0:6:22,69
to convey is is the importance
of giving back, the importance


130
0:6:22,69 --> 0:6:25,3
of volunteering,
of being thoughtful


131
0:6:25,3 --> 0:6:27,9
of others in your community.


132
0:6:27,9 --> 0:6:30,44
That's the best way to
become a leader I think


133
0:6:30,44 --> 0:6:34,17
and understanding
those that need help,


134
0:6:34,17 --> 0:6:35,55
those that need support.


135
0:6:35,55 --> 0:6:38,92
When I was in high school
I had the opportunity


136
0:6:38,92 --> 0:6:40,94
to teach inner city
kids in Havana,


137
0:6:40,94 --> 0:6:43,66
in little Havana, baseball.


138
0:6:43,66 --> 0:6:47,21
I was, the only reason why I
got into Rice basically was


139
0:6:47,21 --> 0:6:48,91
because of my ability
to play baseball.


140
0:6:48,91 --> 0:6:51,79
I had a chance to play with
Alex Rodriguez in high school


141
0:6:51,79 --> 0:6:53,91
which is kinda cool,
and Lance Berkman


142
0:6:53,91 --> 0:6:56,2
and a few other pros at Rice.


143
0:6:56,2 --> 0:6:59,57
But but working with with
inner city kids and baseball


144
0:6:59,57 --> 0:7:5,26
and teaching them the life
skills of of basically stepping


145
0:7:5,26 --> 0:7:7,63
up and being leaders
in their own homes,


146
0:7:7,63 --> 0:7:11,3
in their own right was was
also an important experience.


147
0:7:11,3 --> 0:7:14,14
In, in Houston when I was at
Rice I also had the chance


148
0:7:14,14 --> 0:7:18,21
to to work for a Catholic
charity on the weekend with,


149
0:7:18,21 --> 0:7:21,2
with kids, also in inner
city schools in Houston.


150
0:7:21,2 --> 0:7:22,97
And there, once again,


151
0:7:22,97 --> 0:7:26,69
had an incredible experience
teaching English to the child


152
0:7:26,69 --> 0:7:28,42
of an undocumented immigrant


153
0:7:28,42 --> 0:7:30,69
who was illiterate
even, even in Spanish.


154
0:7:30,69 --> 0:7:34,84
And so we worked, he was a very
unruly child, I was assigned


155
0:7:34,84 --> 0:7:38,69
by one of his teachers who
had difficulties with him,


156
0:7:38,69 --> 0:7:41,2
and we worked over the
course of two years.


157
0:7:41,2 --> 0:7:42,81
Eventually he learned English.


158
0:7:42,81 --> 0:7:45,47
He graduated from junior high,
was the first in his family


159
0:7:45,47 --> 0:7:49,23
to graduate from high school and
and being patient and working


160
0:7:49,23 --> 0:7:53,62
with him, again, was a
transformational experience,


161
0:7:53,62 --> 0:7:56,59
and I think I grew
as a person in terms


162
0:7:56,59 --> 0:7:58,88
of learning what what's
important in life.


163
0:7:58,88 --> 0:8:1,33
And to this day I'm involved
with Big Brothers, Big Sisters.


164
0:8:1,33 --> 0:8:5,99
I'm sure some of you in the room
have heard of this organization.


165
0:8:5,99 --> 0:8:8,56
There's an interesting
program that we're working


166
0:8:8,56 --> 0:8:12,29
at Big Brothers, Big Sisters
where over 90% of kids


167
0:8:12,29 --> 0:8:16,28
of of felons do not go on to
graduate from high school.


168
0:8:16,28 --> 0:8:18,46
And when you look at
our state of Texas,


169
0:8:18,46 --> 0:8:21,8
even within the Latino
population in many areas


170
0:8:21,8 --> 0:8:25,77
of our great state, we have
a dropout rate of over 50%.


171
0:8:25,77 --> 0:8:29,77
This to me is one of the, the
the largest crisis that we face


172
0:8:29,77 --> 0:8:32,95
and that your, our generation
collectively will face


173
0:8:32,95 --> 0:8:34,84
as future educators,
future leaders


174
0:8:34,84 --> 0:8:36,75
in our state and our country.


175
0:8:36,75 --> 0:8:40,65
And so I look forward to working
with you on, on these issues.


176
0:8:40,65 --> 0:8:44,61
The importance of public
service can't be denied.


177
0:8:44,61 --> 0:8:46,43
You know it's very easy
when you when you look


178
0:8:46,43 --> 0:8:49,39
at the voting participation
rates in our country,


179
0:8:49,39 --> 0:8:50,19
you know whether you're looking


180
0:8:50,19 --> 0:8:53,67
at the last presidential
election cycle, less than 25%


181
0:8:53,67 --> 0:8:57,66
of 18 to 29 year olds bothered
to show up at the polls.


182
0:8:57,66 --> 0:9:0,7
Many of you will be
voting for the first time


183
0:9:0,7 --> 0:9:3,13
in the next election cycle and
I encourage you to register


184
0:9:3,13 --> 0:9:6,98
to vote, to to get involved
in that way and get involved


185
0:9:6,98 --> 0:9:8,55
in the political campaign.


186
0:9:8,55 --> 0:9:10,1
That's the best way
to to to learn


187
0:9:10,1 --> 0:9:11,95
about the issues of the day.


188
0:9:11,95 --> 0:9:14,98
There's other w- forms of
public service as well.


189
0:9:14,98 --> 0:9:18,8
My, another experience that I
had was serving in the military


190
0:9:18,8 --> 0:9:20,21
and seeing firsthand
in Afghanistan,


191
0:9:20,21 --> 0:9:22,68
the fifth poorest
country in the world,


192
0:9:22,68 --> 0:9:24,17
the importance of
public service.


193
0:9:24,17 --> 0:9:29,9
We spend $2 billion a week
in in this country rebuilding


194
0:9:29,9 --> 0:9:33,49
and creating a democracy
in an area of the country


195
0:9:33,49 --> 0:9:35,57
where not a lot of
people want democracy,


196
0:9:35,57 --> 0:9:39,75
where self-identification
is more defined by tribe


197
0:9:39,75 --> 0:9:40,9
as opposed to country.


198
0:9:40,9 --> 0:9:44,26
You ask the average Afghan
whether they consider themselves


199
0:9:44,26 --> 0:9:47,82
Afghan, they consider
themselves Pashtun or Gerudo or


200
0:9:47,82 --> 0:9:51,54
or some other ethnic tribe
as opposed to Afghan.


201
0:9:51,54 --> 0:9:55,36
And so even though we as
Americans are doing so much


202
0:9:55,36 --> 0:9:59,14
in Iraq and Afghanistan, part of
public service has to come from,


203
0:9:59,14 --> 0:10:3,44
from the community, from
people like all of y'all.


204
0:10:3,44 --> 0:10:6,2
And so I I look forward
to to further talking


205
0:10:6,2 --> 0:10:8,44
about the importance of that.


206
0:10:8,44 --> 0:10:11,1
Here in the U.S. I I
can't help but think


207
0:10:11,1 --> 0:10:14,3
about when people complain
about politics and they complain


208
0:10:14,3 --> 0:10:17,12
about government, that at
the same time they don't get


209
0:10:17,12 --> 0:10:21,6
involved and run for office or
help out political campaigns or


210
0:10:21,6 --> 0:10:24,25
or or do, or volunteer
in their communities.


211
0:10:24,25 --> 0:10:27,78
And I can't help but think of a
quote from Plato where he says


212
0:10:27,78 --> 0:10:30,9
that the consequence of
of not being involved


213
0:10:30,9 --> 0:10:33,24
in your government and not being
involved in public service is


214
0:10:33,24 --> 0:10:35,79
that you end up being
governed by your inferiors.


215
0:10:35,79 --> 0:10:38,7
And that's not to say that
our current political leaders,


216
0:10:38,7 --> 0:10:41,99
republican or democrat,
are inferior or a cast


217
0:10:41,99 --> 0:10:44,62
of of inferiors, but
it is to say that if


218
0:10:44,62 --> 0:10:49,61
if our generation doesn't step
up, then we face a huge crisis,


219
0:10:49,61 --> 0:10:52,62
a huge deficit where people
choose not to get involved


220
0:10:52,62 --> 0:10:55,63
in public service and
leadership positions.


221
0:10:55,63 --> 0:10:56,69
There's so many different ways


222
0:10:56,69 --> 0:10:58,41
to get involved outside
of politics.


223
0:10:58,41 --> 0:11:0,76
As a member of a
Bush family it's,


224
0:11:0,76 --> 0:11:3,44
it's easy to say you know
go out and run for office,


225
0:11:3,44 --> 0:11:5,62
but there's non-for-profit
organizations


226
0:11:5,62 --> 0:11:8,99
that I know y'all are already
involved in in your high schools


227
0:11:8,99 --> 0:11:11,66
and that you will be
involved in in college.


228
0:11:11,66 --> 0:11:16,14
There's also non-for-profit
organizations that affect issues


229
0:11:16,14 --> 0:11:18,8
that that you feel
passionately about.


230
0:11:18,8 --> 0:11:21,96
And it doesn't necessarily have
to be education or mentoring,


231
0:11:21,96 --> 0:11:25,3
but there's so many different
special interest groups


232
0:11:25,3 --> 0:11:28,43
that you can get involved in and
I would just encourage you all


233
0:11:28,43 --> 0:11:29,85
to volunteer time
and your effort.


234
0:11:29,85 --> 0:11:33,12
You know the extra moments
that you spend with,


235
0:11:33,12 --> 0:11:35,45
with others makes a difference.


236
0:11:35,45 --> 0:11:36,71
One person at a time.


237
0:11:36,71 --> 0:11:40,42
I remember being an inner city
high school teacher and starting


238
0:11:40,42 --> 0:11:43,98
out the year with 150
students and by the end


239
0:11:43,98 --> 0:11:45,97
of the year I was left
with about 90 students.


240
0:11:45,97 --> 0:11:50,33
I had several, several kids
drop out due to possession


241
0:11:50,33 --> 0:11:53,47
of narcotics, possession
of weapons,


242
0:11:53,47 --> 0:11:57,15
and what I learned is instead
of looking at, you know,


243
0:11:57,15 --> 0:11:58,39
the macro issue sometimes,


244
0:11:58,39 --> 0:12:0,31
sometimes your victories
are one kid at a time,


245
0:12:0,31 --> 0:12:1,82
one student at a time.


246
0:12:1,82 --> 0:12:5,27
And so I I encourage you to
look at issues that way as well.


247
0:12:5,27 --> 0:12:8,58
So with that I want to
turn it back to you guys


248
0:12:8,58 --> 0:12:11,1
to offer any kind of, any kind


249
0:12:11,1 --> 0:12:12,6
of commentary that
you might have.


250
0:12:12,6 --> 0:12:14,28
I'm I'm, I want to
open a dialogue


251
0:12:14,28 --> 0:12:17,54
to any questions you might have
'cause otherwise I could be


252
0:12:17,54 --> 0:12:21,14
up here all all night long, all
afternoon long talking to you


253
0:12:21,14 --> 0:12:25,24
so I'd encourage any
questions you might have.


254
0:12:25,24 --> 0:12:26,61
>> All right.


255
0:12:26,61 --> 0:12:28,49
Hello. So you know I think


256
0:12:28,49 --> 0:12:29,99
that everything the
United States does


257
0:12:29,99 --> 0:12:32,22
for other countries is amazing,
you know with Americare,


258
0:12:32,22 --> 0:12:35,68
with giving back, you know
helping Afghanistan rebuild


259
0:12:35,68 --> 0:12:38,79
themselves, Iraq, but you know
while all that is happening,


260
0:12:38,79 --> 0:12:41,3
in the U.S. we have
our own crisis.


261
0:12:41,3 --> 0:12:45,8
27,000 high school students, you
know, are gonna be without 70%


262
0:12:45,8 --> 0:12:47,8
of funding because of the
education budget cuts.


263
0:12:47,8 --> 0:12:50,86
So what is your stance on
the education budget cuts?


264
0:12:50,86 --> 0:12:54,19
>> Well thankfully I'm not in
elected politics so I don't ,


265
0:12:54,19 --> 0:12:57,23
I don't have a committed
position on the issue but,


266
0:12:57,23 --> 0:12:58,11
you're absolutely right.


267
0:12:58,11 --> 0:13:2,18
I mean we have, we're spending
billions of dollars a week


268
0:13:2,18 --> 0:13:7,45
if not every month on both the
conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq,


269
0:13:7,45 --> 0:13:12,64
now Libya, and we're looking
at other, other conflicts


270
0:13:12,64 --> 0:13:16,6
that arising with the
spring, the Arab spring


271
0:13:16,6 --> 0:13:21,0
if you will call it that,
and Syria and Yemen.


272
0:13:21,0 --> 0:13:22,64
And it's it's a generational
change


273
0:13:22,64 --> 0:13:24,41
that many people never
thought that they would see


274
0:13:24,41 --> 0:13:28,6
in the middle east and so
what, not only rhetorically


275
0:13:28,6 --> 0:13:29,4
as Americans in terms


276
0:13:29,4 --> 0:13:31,46
of our foreign policy is
it important what we do,


277
0:13:31,46 --> 0:13:34,55
but in terms of how we
commit our existing assets


278
0:13:34,55 --> 0:13:37,8
and resources is
going to be vital.


279
0:13:37,8 --> 0:13:42,56
I am one to to believe that
we are still the most powerful


280
0:13:42,56 --> 0:13:46,1
country in the world and
that that our matter,


281
0:13:46,1 --> 0:13:49,18
that our actions matter.


282
0:13:49,18 --> 0:13:52,75
And so you know I commend
our current leaders


283
0:13:52,75 --> 0:13:54,14
to their thoughtful approach


284
0:13:54,14 --> 0:13:56,66
to what's happening
in the middle east.


285
0:13:56,66 --> 0:13:58,44
In terms of what's happening
here in the state of Texas,


286
0:13:58,44 --> 0:14:1,13
absolutely, we face
an education crisis.


287
0:14:1,13 --> 0:14:3,59
The stats speak to themselves
whether you're talking


288
0:14:3,59 --> 0:14:7,13
about high school dropout
rates in the valley


289
0:14:7,13 --> 0:14:9,3
within the Hispanic population.


290
0:14:9,3 --> 0:14:14,31
When you look at the state
budget, education is roughly 60%


291
0:14:14,31 --> 0:14:15,75
of the overall budget.


292
0:14:15,75 --> 0:14:19,9
We had, come heading into this
legislative session we had


293
0:14:19,9 --> 0:14:23,2
about a 20 to $30
billion shortfall


294
0:14:23,2 --> 0:14:26,68
which is a pretty large,
large deficit to make up.


295
0:14:26,68 --> 0:14:29,3
And so when you're, when you're
talking about closing that gap,


296
0:14:29,3 --> 0:14:32,71
if you're serious about it,
for better or worse you have


297
0:14:32,71 --> 0:14:35,16
to look at cuts in education.


298
0:14:35,16 --> 0:14:38,42
So since we're doing that,
unless you want to raise taxes


299
0:14:38,42 --> 0:14:41,98
which is not always the most
politically popular thing to do.


300
0:14:41,98 --> 0:14:46,37
So when doing that you have to
balance where, where do we cut?


301
0:14:46,37 --> 0:14:50,25
And one of the, I haven't been
following it as closely as most,


302
0:14:50,25 --> 0:14:53,61
but in terms of what we're
seeing right now is is allowing


303
0:14:53,61 --> 0:14:57,12
for more tenured teachers
and you know teachers


304
0:14:57,12 --> 0:15:0,76
that are closer to
retirement to retire early and


305
0:15:0,76 --> 0:15:3,64
and basically you know
younger teachers that are going


306
0:15:3,64 --> 0:15:6,74
into the profession are paid
a little bit less than the


307
0:15:6,74 --> 0:15:9,4
than the more experienced
and and veteran teachers.


308
0:15:9,4 --> 0:15:12,47
There's also you know looks


309
0:15:12,47 --> 0:15:14,75
of accounting you know
gimmicks basically


310
0:15:14,75 --> 0:15:18,66
to to basically instead of
have it go with inflation,


311
0:15:18,66 --> 0:15:22,64
keep it fairly flat lined for
the next two years so that,


312
0:15:22,64 --> 0:15:25,65
so that revenues will
catch up with spending.


313
0:15:25,65 --> 0:15:29,1
So, long winded way of
saying that we're gonna have


314
0:15:29,1 --> 0:15:30,6
to make some tough decisions.


315
0:15:30,6 --> 0:15:31,99
It's not gonna please everybody.


316
0:15:31,99 --> 0:15:35,83
There will probably be some
teachers that are let go,


317
0:15:35,83 --> 0:15:38,43
but if we're gonna be
serious about, you know,


318
0:15:38,43 --> 0:15:42,38
balancing our budget, you
know you and if you're serious


319
0:15:42,38 --> 0:15:44,55
about doing it, you
look at a majority


320
0:15:44,55 --> 0:15:46,21
of the budget, it's
in education.


321
0:15:46,21 --> 0:15:49,69
And so, so what I would
also advocate is looking


322
0:15:49,69 --> 0:15:52,85
at maximizing, you know,
the dollars to make sure


323
0:15:52,85 --> 0:15:53,85
that every dollar
that we're spending


324
0:15:53,85 --> 0:15:57,1
in education is doing
what it's intended to do.


325
0:15:57,1 --> 0:15:59,44
So I would put everything
on the table,


326
0:15:59,44 --> 0:16:2,21
how do we reform education
to make it such that


327
0:16:2,21 --> 0:16:4,8
when you guys are
graduating from college,


328
0:16:4,8 --> 0:16:8,23
you you are paid
accordingly for for results.


329
0:16:8,23 --> 0:16:11,99
So that if you are working
in an inner city school


330
0:16:11,99 --> 0:16:16,25
and you are taking a class of,
in in a failing school from,


331
0:16:16,25 --> 0:16:20,35
you know mediocre test
results to to above mediocre


332
0:16:20,35 --> 0:16:23,98
or above average, you
should be rewarded for that.


333
0:16:23,98 --> 0:16:26,59
And so, implementing some types


334
0:16:26,59 --> 0:16:29,25
of reforms I think would
go a long way as well.


335
0:16:29,25 --> 0:16:32,49
Excellent question by the way.


336
0:16:32,49 --> 0:16:34,56
>> You spoke of high
dropout rates,


337
0:16:34,56 --> 0:16:38,86
what would you propose
to lower those?


338
0:16:38,86 --> 0:16:43,19
>> To me, you know when I was in
an inner city high school school


339
0:16:43,19 --> 0:16:46,88
and in Miami when I was
teaching, I was actually


340
0:16:46,88 --> 0:16:48,73
in the dropout prevention
program.


341
0:16:48,73 --> 0:16:51,2
So a lot of the kids in
the state of Florida,


342
0:16:51,2 --> 0:16:55,13
and I believe it's
the case in Texas


343
0:16:55,13 --> 0:16:57,93
that when you turn 16
you can legally drop out.


344
0:16:57,93 --> 0:17:0,69
So most of the kids at my
class, this is freshman year,


345
0:17:0,69 --> 0:17:4,66
9th grade, that were already 16,


346
0:17:4,66 --> 0:17:7,87
well a lot of my young
women were were pregnant


347
0:17:7,87 --> 0:17:10,61
and I already had, you
know many young men


348
0:17:10,61 --> 0:17:13,42
that had a prison record or,
you know, had been in and out


349
0:17:13,42 --> 0:17:16,62
of of juvenile institutions.


350
0:17:16,62 --> 0:17:21,36
So without sounding sarcastic,
there's gonna be a percentage


351
0:17:21,36 --> 0:17:23,55
of students that we're gonna be,


352
0:17:23,55 --> 0:17:25,43
that that's gonna
be very difficult


353
0:17:25,43 --> 0:17:27,26
to reach out to and change.


354
0:17:27,26 --> 0:17:29,91
We we can't rescue every kid,


355
0:17:29,91 --> 0:17:32,95
but what we can do is create a
curriculum that's more relevant


356
0:17:32,95 --> 0:17:34,94
to the lives of those
that are thinking


357
0:17:34,94 --> 0:17:37,7
about a different path in life.


358
0:17:37,7 --> 0:17:41,74
As a p-, not every kid is gonna
go to, to Harvard and Yale


359
0:17:41,74 --> 0:17:43,87
or great schools like UT.


360
0:17:43,87 --> 0:17:48,9
What can we do in our curriculum
to make, make it more relevant


361
0:17:48,9 --> 0:17:51,26
so that if kids have an interest
in, you know, technology,


362
0:17:51,26 --> 0:17:55,5
or an interest in auto repair,
that they can do so immediately


363
0:17:55,5 --> 0:17:58,0
in high school when they're
not learning about, you know,


364
0:17:58,0 --> 0:18:1,15
16th century, you know, art.


365
0:18:1,15 --> 0:18:4,9
You know and and it's just
not not as relevant in terms


366
0:18:4,9 --> 0:18:5,23
of what they're gonna
see in terms


367
0:18:5,23 --> 0:18:6,71
of a tangible job out there.


368
0:18:6,71 --> 0:18:9,58
We're blessed to be in a
state where we've created,


369
0:18:9,58 --> 0:18:11,21
in in the last since
the beginning


370
0:18:11,21 --> 0:18:15,8
of the recession almost a third
of every job created in the U.S.


371
0:18:15,8 --> 0:18:16,84
which is unbelievable
to think about.


372
0:18:16,84 --> 0:18:20,73
So, you hit on a very important
issue, how do we get that kid


373
0:18:20,73 --> 0:18:23,78
who is in 9th grade
thinking about dropout,


374
0:18:23,78 --> 0:18:26,8
just to hold on until
12th grade?


375
0:18:26,8 --> 0:18:30,61
There's been measures proposed
to to to pay students to get


376
0:18:30,61 --> 0:18:32,99
through high-- I I'm
not an advocate of that.


377
0:18:32,99 --> 0:18:36,58
I do believe that if we
incentivize teachers, the best


378
0:18:36,58 --> 0:18:39,83
and the brightest that come
out of our universities,


379
0:18:39,83 --> 0:18:42,1
that want to take on a career
in education that they go


380
0:18:42,1 --> 0:18:44,13
into the inner city
like Teach for America


381
0:18:44,13 --> 0:18:47,5
which is a great program,
to go out and take


382
0:18:47,5 --> 0:18:49,2
on these huge challenges.


383
0:18:49,2 --> 0:18:50,72
'Cause I think with
passionate teaching


384
0:18:50,72 --> 0:18:52,88
and passionate administ-
you guys know,


385
0:18:52,88 --> 0:18:54,13
you're in high school.


386
0:18:54,13 --> 0:18:57,61
You you learn more with teachers
that are engaged and passionate


387
0:18:57,61 --> 0:18:59,35
about your, your own life.


388
0:18:59,35 --> 0:19:3,89
And so if we can incentivize and
create a structure for teachers


389
0:19:3,89 --> 0:19:7,29
to do that, I think that would
go, go a much longer way.


390
0:19:7,29 --> 0:19:10,34
>> Hi my name is
Stephen Dominguez.


391
0:19:10,34 --> 0:19:15,21
I'm from here in Austin, Texas
and well first of all thank you


392
0:19:15,21 --> 0:19:18,17
so much for sharing your
story, it was very inspiring,


393
0:19:18,17 --> 0:19:21,32
and for being here today.


394
0:19:21,32 --> 0:19:24,47
We have this proposal project
going on that we're supposed


395
0:19:24,47 --> 0:19:29,77
to find a problem maybe within
our community and how to fix it,


396
0:19:29,77 --> 0:19:33,17
my question is maybe
what do you think


397
0:19:33,17 --> 0:19:37,76
that we could do right now, the
coming rising seniors going back


398
0:19:37,76 --> 0:19:39,44
to our senior year
in high school


399
0:19:39,44 --> 0:19:42,98
to maybe improve our community
in any way since you have


400
0:19:42,98 --> 0:19:44,99
such great experience?


401
0:19:44,99 --> 0:19:46,13
>> Absolutely.


402
0:19:46,13 --> 0:19:48,74
There there's a there's a
lot of different issues.


403
0:19:48,74 --> 0:19:53,24
I think mentoring
is is a big one.


404
0:19:53,24 --> 0:19:55,26
You know Big Brothers,
Big Sisters is a,


405
0:19:55,26 --> 0:19:57,12
I'm a huge advocate for it.


406
0:19:57,12 --> 0:19:59,5
There's so many different
non-for-profit organizations


407
0:19:59,5 --> 0:20:2,6
that, that get involved
in the community.


408
0:20:2,6 --> 0:20:6,35
There's recycling programs,
environmental programs


409
0:20:6,35 --> 0:20:9,54
that I think you can build
the leadership, build a board


410
0:20:9,54 --> 0:20:11,15
of advisors if you will


411
0:20:11,15 --> 0:20:14,92
that would guide you towards you
know raising a certain amount


412
0:20:14,92 --> 0:20:18,51
of money to-- I would
consider being an entrepreneur


413
0:20:18,51 --> 0:20:21,78
in non-for-profits you
know because you're,


414
0:20:21,78 --> 0:20:25,28
after having visited with you
you're obviously, you know,


415
0:20:25,28 --> 0:20:27,63
a bright kid and a huge future.


416
0:20:27,63 --> 0:20:30,6
Why not create your
own non-for-profit


417
0:20:30,6 --> 0:20:31,64
and you know create a business.


418
0:20:31,64 --> 0:20:35,35
You know there's a cool industry
that's developing here in Austin


419
0:20:35,35 --> 0:20:37,18
in terms of social
entrepreneurship


420
0:20:37,18 --> 0:20:39,73
where you take small
business principles,


421
0:20:39,73 --> 0:20:42,49
go out create a non-for-profit,
write a business plan,


422
0:20:42,49 --> 0:20:45,18
go out and raise money
and then impact an issue


423
0:20:45,18 --> 0:20:47,9
that you personally
feel passionate about.


424
0:20:47,9 --> 0:20:49,81
Rally other people
around the cause.


425
0:20:49,81 --> 0:20:52,15
Get a board of advisors of
people that have experience


426
0:20:52,15 --> 0:20:54,79
in that area to allow
you to go out


427
0:20:54,79 --> 0:20:57,14
and build it, build the dream.


428
0:20:57,14 --> 0:21:1,24
Here at UT, I can't tell you how
many great non-for-profits have


429
0:21:1,24 --> 0:21:5,16
stemmed from UT students
that were here during college


430
0:21:5,16 --> 0:21:7,84
and created these wonderful
business plans while they were,


431
0:21:7,84 --> 0:21:10,78
while they were studying because
they felt passionate about it.


432
0:21:10,78 --> 0:21:13,16
They found time and prioritized
time in their own schedule


433
0:21:13,16 --> 0:21:15,98
to do it which is
pretty amazing.


434
0:21:15,98 --> 0:21:18,78
In fact one that I'm
involved with here


435
0:21:18,78 --> 0:21:21,69
in Austin is called East
Side Community Connection


436
0:21:21,69 --> 0:21:26,28
where we feed predominantly
transient families


437
0:21:26,28 --> 0:21:30,47
that that are either seeking
political asylum in our country


438
0:21:30,47 --> 0:21:33,51
or are undocumented immigrants.


439
0:21:33,51 --> 0:21:36,48
And you know the poverty
rate is fairly high,


440
0:21:36,48 --> 0:21:38,36
and while they stabilize
their lives,


441
0:21:38,36 --> 0:21:41,77
you know we help them get
educated, we help feed them,


442
0:21:41,77 --> 0:21:44,36
we provide financial literacy


443
0:21:44,36 --> 0:21:46,9
as they get acclimated
to to Austin.


444
0:21:46,9 --> 0:21:50,6
The the organization was
founded just six years ago.


445
0:21:50,6 --> 0:21:53,82
It was kind of a, it's almost
like starting a small business;


446
0:21:53,82 --> 0:21:56,83
it's kind of a risky venture
at first but we were able


447
0:21:56,83 --> 0:21:59,15
to get a good board of
advisors, we got great speakers.


448
0:21:59,15 --> 0:22:2,81
We had Colt McCoy come
one year which is cool,


449
0:22:2,81 --> 0:22:4,15
and and raised a lot of money


450
0:22:4,15 --> 0:22:5,85
and the rest had
kind of taken off.


451
0:22:5,85 --> 0:22:9,19
So I would, I wouldn't rule
that out as well as kind


452
0:22:9,19 --> 0:22:13,87
of joining an existing,
you know, non-for-profit.


453
0:22:13,87 --> 0:22:17,53
>> Hello [inaudible] George
Garcia from Brownsville, Texas.


454
0:22:17,53 --> 0:22:20,86
And okay so aside from funding
issues and dropout rates,


455
0:22:20,86 --> 0:22:24,83
I know that compared to
other leading nations


456
0:22:24,83 --> 0:22:30,95
in the education system, the
states score lower than 50%


457
0:22:30,95 --> 0:22:34,63
in some of the tests, and
in fact Washington D.C.,


458
0:22:34,63 --> 0:22:38,32
the nation's capitol, scores
about 6%, the lowest in fact


459
0:22:38,32 --> 0:22:42,36
of the whole United
States and it's just proven


460
0:22:42,36 --> 0:22:45,19
that our education
system is not as effective


461
0:22:45,19 --> 0:22:46,94
as other nations,
leading nations.


462
0:22:46,94 --> 0:22:50,1
I wanted to ask you what do
you think is setting us back


463
0:22:50,1 --> 0:22:52,62
and what we can do
to improve it?


464
0:22:52,62 --> 0:22:53,89
>> That's a very good question.


465
0:22:53,89 --> 0:22:57,64
I think, you know, to
further add to your question,


466
0:22:57,64 --> 0:22:59,0
one of the most startling
aspects


467
0:22:59,0 --> 0:23:1,66
where we're behind
is math and science.


468
0:23:1,66 --> 0:23:3,69
When you c- when you look
at the totality of it,


469
0:23:3,69 --> 0:23:7,4
we are you know roughly 50
percentile, but when you look


470
0:23:7,4 --> 0:23:9,57
at science and math
we're we're at the bottom


471
0:23:9,57 --> 0:23:10,94
of industrialized nations


472
0:23:10,94 --> 0:23:15,12
and so that's problematic
for our future.


473
0:23:15,12 --> 0:23:17,27
The tiny country,
the tiny country


474
0:23:17,27 --> 0:23:21,39
of Taiwan is producing roughly,
roughly 10 times the amount


475
0:23:21,39 --> 0:23:23,38
of patents, intellectual
property,


476
0:23:23,38 --> 0:23:26,6
that we are producing
as Americans.


477
0:23:26,6 --> 0:23:29,95
Here at UT it's one of the
few areas, we're blessed


478
0:23:29,95 --> 0:23:32,82
to be surrounded by brilliant
scientists and engineers


479
0:23:32,82 --> 0:23:35,14
that are putting out, you
know, intellectual property,


480
0:23:35,14 --> 0:23:37,34
you know, on a daily basis.


481
0:23:37,34 --> 0:23:38,87
But there's not enough of that.


482
0:23:38,87 --> 0:23:42,33
So what I would propose is,
again going back to the point


483
0:23:42,33 --> 0:23:46,69
of designing a curriculum
that's more germane to the lives


484
0:23:46,69 --> 0:23:49,12
of people in terms
of finding a job.


485
0:23:49,12 --> 0:23:50,35
'Cause I think there's
this huge gap


486
0:23:50,35 --> 0:23:53,45
between high school
and the real world.


487
0:23:53,45 --> 0:23:57,31
And you know there's, one of
the first investors in Facebook,


488
0:23:57,31 --> 0:23:59,73
Peter Thiel, I don't know if
you've heard of that name,


489
0:23:59,73 --> 0:24:2,57
he's he's a radical
on this issue.


490
0:24:2,57 --> 0:24:4,88
He says that much of
what we're learning


491
0:24:4,88 --> 0:24:8,7
in in high school is really
irrelevant to to what kind


492
0:24:8,7 --> 0:24:10,37
of jobs you're gonna take on.


493
0:24:10,37 --> 0:24:12,38
And so what I would
propose for those


494
0:24:12,38 --> 0:24:16,1
that demonstrate an interest in
math and science in junior high


495
0:24:16,1 --> 0:24:19,52
that there's there's a feeder
system for you to go on and


496
0:24:19,52 --> 0:24:22,6
and work in a laboratory early
on, and you're working side


497
0:24:22,6 --> 0:24:24,1
by side by engineers,


498
0:24:24,1 --> 0:24:27,25
and so there's an apprenticeship
approach where you're learning


499
0:24:27,25 --> 0:24:30,69
with people in the field and
you have an ability to get a job


500
0:24:30,69 --> 0:24:35,23
at say Exxon or Shell or a
huge publicly held company


501
0:24:35,23 --> 0:24:40,33
that are dying for engineering
and and science talent.


502
0:24:40,33 --> 0:24:43,98
Another thing that's happening
is is that, using the example


503
0:24:43,98 --> 0:24:45,19
of Rice at grad school,


504
0:24:45,19 --> 0:24:49,1
in the computer sciences school
I think there was roughly


505
0:24:49,1 --> 0:24:53,56
over 100 students, 90%
were Chinese nationals


506
0:24:53,56 --> 0:24:56,68
and they graduated at
the top of the class.


507
0:24:56,68 --> 0:25:0,51
And what we did is that most
of them went back to China.


508
0:25:0,51 --> 0:25:3,61
They, because they saw more
opportunity and and not only


509
0:25:3,61 --> 0:25:6,99
that but you know we we
have reduced the amount


510
0:25:6,99 --> 0:25:11,27
of H1 visas that, H1B visas
which we provide to those


511
0:25:11,27 --> 0:25:13,92
that want to learn in math and
science, the ability to stay


512
0:25:13,92 --> 0:25:16,37
in our country to take on jobs.


513
0:25:16,37 --> 0:25:19,61
Why not r- I mean, the U.S.
univers- post-secondary,


514
0:25:19,61 --> 0:25:23,13
including UT in the analysis
is still the number one choice


515
0:25:23,13 --> 0:25:24,6
in the world.


516
0:25:24,6 --> 0:25:28,2
You you travel across the
the world and you still see


517
0:25:28,2 --> 0:25:29,0
that the the influential,


518
0:25:29,0 --> 0:25:31,2
and their societies are still
sending their kids here.


519
0:25:31,2 --> 0:25:34,33
Why not tap that talent and
and create incentives for them,


520
0:25:34,33 --> 0:25:37,72
for them to stay as well as
change the organic structure


521
0:25:37,72 --> 0:25:39,13
of our own country


522
0:25:39,13 --> 0:25:43,0
to get involved more
in math and science?


523
0:25:43,0 --> 0:25:45,12
The second point that I
wanted to make with respect


524
0:25:45,12 --> 0:25:48,77
to your question is just
overall wholesale reform.


525
0:25:48,77 --> 0:25:50,74
Right now our approach
to education


526
0:25:50,74 --> 0:25:55,15
in the 20th century is a
factory, is a one size fits all.


527
0:25:55,15 --> 0:25:58,65
So, in my opinion, the
structure of what a school


528
0:25:58,65 --> 0:26:2,13
in Highland Park is the same
as what you see in Brownsville


529
0:26:2,13 --> 0:26:5,21
and that's not, I don't think
that matches with reality.


530
0:26:5,21 --> 0:26:8,13
I think you have, we need to go
back to a little red schoolhouse


531
0:26:8,13 --> 0:26:10,8
on the on the block
approach to education


532
0:26:10,8 --> 0:26:14,6
where the teachers know the
students, there's open lines


533
0:26:14,6 --> 0:26:18,55
of communication, there's
parent teacher interaction


534
0:26:18,55 --> 0:26:21,53
and we've reduced
the size of classes.


535
0:26:21,53 --> 0:26:24,65
I remember when I was a teacher
and I had over 40 students


536
0:26:24,65 --> 0:26:26,6
in my class, you guys
know what it's like;


537
0:26:26,6 --> 0:26:28,57
it's it's just pandemonium.


538
0:26:28,57 --> 0:26:32,87
When you have, and when you
go to great schools you'll see


539
0:26:32,87 --> 0:26:34,5
that you're you're going to,


540
0:26:34,5 --> 0:26:36,67
the learning experience
is gonna be enhanced


541
0:26:36,67 --> 0:26:38,62
when you have more one
on one interactions


542
0:26:38,62 --> 0:26:40,38
with teachers as well.


543
0:26:40,38 --> 0:26:44,97
So reducing class sizes I
think would go a long way and


544
0:26:44,97 --> 0:26:47,34
and making schools more
relevant to the communities


545
0:26:47,34 --> 0:26:49,33
in which they're
reliant as opposed to a,


546
0:26:49,33 --> 0:26:52,43
a factory sized approach
to, to education.


547
0:26:52,43 --> 0:26:57,4
>> Hi my name is Alexa Edwards
and I'm from Dallas and,


548
0:26:57,4 --> 0:26:58,36
once again, thank
you for being here.


549
0:26:58,36 --> 0:27:2,58
And I just wanted to point out
obviously we are the generation


550
0:27:2,58 --> 0:27:5,86
of technology and I really
just wanted to know your stance


551
0:27:5,86 --> 0:27:7,75
on technology in
schools 'cause I know


552
0:27:7,75 --> 0:27:10,55
that it has its advantages
and disadvantages,


553
0:27:10,55 --> 0:27:13,99
advantages being you know it's
easier to use, it's faster,


554
0:27:13,99 --> 0:27:16,99
you know it's most relevant to
what's going on in our society,


555
0:27:16,99 --> 0:27:20,5
but the disadvantages
that our skills in writing


556
0:27:20,5 --> 0:27:23,92
and math obviously
are decreasing.


557
0:27:23,92 --> 0:27:26,78
So I just wanted to know
how, do you think it's better


558
0:27:26,78 --> 0:27:30,0
that technology is becoming such
an important factor in schools


559
0:27:30,0 --> 0:27:32,27
or do you think that we
should pay attention more


560
0:27:32,27 --> 0:27:34,8
to the basics and
the fundamentals?


561
0:27:34,8 --> 0:27:38,29
>> Well I I think that's a very
good question and it's one that,


562
0:27:38,29 --> 0:27:40,81
you know, as as educators
we constantly have


563
0:27:40,81 --> 0:27:42,2
to think about honestly.


564
0:27:42,2 --> 0:27:45,42
I I personally would advocate
that we embrace technology.


565
0:27:45,42 --> 0:27:49,37
You know the, the scale by which
technology is improving our


566
0:27:49,37 --> 0:27:50,79
lives is dramatic.


567
0:27:50,79 --> 0:27:51,94
There's definitely downside.


568
0:27:51,94 --> 0:27:55,79
I mean taking the experience
of being a high school teacher,


569
0:27:55,79 --> 0:27:59,3
most of my students you know
basically write in short,


570
0:27:59,3 --> 0:28:2,22
truncated sentences as opposed
to well thought out paragraphs.


571
0:28:2,22 --> 0:28:3,68
That's certainly a downside.


572
0:28:3,68 --> 0:28:6,63
But the upside is that
you're you're catching a huge


573
0:28:6,63 --> 0:28:7,57
tidal wave.


574
0:28:7,57 --> 0:28:11,99
You know companies like
Apple, Facebook, Google,


575
0:28:11,99 --> 0:28:16,85
really were created by
entrepreneurship and creativity


576
0:28:16,85 --> 0:28:20,7
and I think if we are
embracing technology in a


577
0:28:20,7 --> 0:28:22,49
in a secondary education
environment,


578
0:28:22,49 --> 0:28:25,94
we're giving young
Americans a chance to,


579
0:28:25,94 --> 0:28:29,2
to think about how we
can further innovate and


580
0:28:29,2 --> 0:28:31,62
and further think of
ways to make, you know,


581
0:28:31,62 --> 0:28:33,1
technology more interesting
and relevant


582
0:28:33,1 --> 0:28:35,2
to the lives of of the world.


583
0:28:35,2 --> 0:28:37,19
That's one of the advantages
that we have I think


584
0:28:37,19 --> 0:28:40,72
as Americans is that
we have Silicon Valley.


585
0:28:40,72 --> 0:28:44,98
Silicon Valley is now
exporting more than just


586
0:28:44,98 --> 0:28:48,37
about any other region
of our country because,


587
0:28:48,37 --> 0:28:51,51
you know you you read their
articles in India and China


588
0:28:51,51 --> 0:28:53,7
about the latest Apple
products that are released,


589
0:28:53,7 --> 0:28:55,97
you see lines going
out the door.


590
0:28:55,97 --> 0:29:0,43
We've traditionally as Americans
have exported, you know, Chevy's


591
0:29:0,43 --> 0:29:3,9
and cars and I think
those days are are gone.


592
0:29:3,9 --> 0:29:7,36
But everybody around the world
has got a Facebook account,


593
0:29:7,36 --> 0:29:8,85
and so I think to the extent


594
0:29:8,85 --> 0:29:13,85
that we can dovetail technology
with, with high school education


595
0:29:13,85 --> 0:29:18,37
and make it, make it relevant,
and apply business models to,


596
0:29:18,37 --> 0:29:22,15
to what's out there I think
that it's an exciting thing.


597
0:29:22,15 --> 0:29:25,36
Without losing grasp of of
fundamental education, the X's


598
0:29:25,36 --> 0:29:30,38
and O's that that that kids need
before, you know, graduating.


599
0:29:30,38 --> 0:29:34,5
>> Hello, I'm [inaudible] a
deaf student from [inaudible]


600
0:29:34,5 --> 0:29:37,91
and I aspire to be a surgeon.


601
0:29:37,91 --> 0:29:43,87
I want to know what is your,
what is your opinion of the,


602
0:29:43,87 --> 0:29:48,62
what, what do you think
is a growing problem


603
0:29:48,62 --> 0:29:52,47
in the medical community,
a growing problem


604
0:29:52,47 --> 0:29:53,73
in the medical community


605
0:29:53,73 --> 0:29:57,7
that requires the
attention of everybody here?


606
0:29:57,7 --> 0:30:2,1
>> Do do you mind
restating please?


607
0:30:2,1 --> 0:30:3,24
Sorry.


608
0:30:3,24 --> 0:30:5,25
>> Sorry I'm--


609
0:30:5,25 --> 0:30:7,9
>> No no no.


610
0:30:7,9 --> 0:30:15,29
>> What is your opinion, what do
you think is a growing problem


611
0:30:15,29 --> 0:30:19,5
in the medical community?


612
0:30:19,5 --> 0:30:22,5
>> In the, which commun-
medical community?


613
0:30:22,5 --> 0:30:24,56
>> Yeah.


614
0:30:24,56 --> 0:30:31,67
>> What do you think is
a, is the growing problem


615
0:30:31,67 --> 0:30:33,71
of the medical community?


616
0:30:33,71 --> 0:30:36,84
>> Very good question.


617
0:30:36,84 --> 0:30:40,44
It's a- it's definitely at
the center of everybody's mind


618
0:30:40,44 --> 0:30:43,68
in terms of, you know,
the recent proposal


619
0:30:43,68 --> 0:30:46,23
that has come from, from
the white house in terms


620
0:30:46,23 --> 0:30:49,83
of what the future of healthcare
looks like in our country.


621
0:30:49,83 --> 0:30:52,55
Not only that but applications


622
0:30:52,55 --> 0:30:56,23
to medical schools are
are down significantly.


623
0:30:56,23 --> 0:30:59,45
It's no longer viewed
as as the profession


624
0:30:59,45 --> 0:31:1,19
in many respects
as as it once was.


625
0:31:1,19 --> 0:31:3,39
Unfortunately there are
too many lawyers, and the,


626
0:31:3,39 --> 0:31:6,38
and I can say that as a lawyer.


627
0:31:6,38 --> 0:31:9,61
And and I would not
discourage you to to


628
0:31:9,61 --> 0:31:10,56
to not look at medicine.


629
0:31:10,56 --> 0:31:12,13
I think it's a wonderful
profession


630
0:31:12,13 --> 0:31:17,85
and you know it's obviously
been beneficial to our country.


631
0:31:17,85 --> 0:31:21,54
But in my opinion, in my humble
opinion, I think there needs


632
0:31:21,54 --> 0:31:24,72
to be, similar to my
thoughts on education,


633
0:31:24,72 --> 0:31:28,48
there needs to be reform with
respect to, to healthcare.


634
0:31:28,48 --> 0:31:29,87
One of the great things


635
0:31:29,87 --> 0:31:33,38
about our country is is having
optionality whether it's,


636
0:31:33,38 --> 0:31:37,62
you know, going down the street
to to get McDonald's as opposed


637
0:31:37,62 --> 0:31:41,59
to Burger King or
hopefully choosing the school


638
0:31:41,59 --> 0:31:44,88
that you want to send your kids
to as opposed to another school


639
0:31:44,88 --> 0:31:47,89
that the same would apply to
healthcare, that you would get


640
0:31:47,89 --> 0:31:52,5
to choose basically what doctor
you see for what purposes


641
0:31:52,5 --> 0:31:56,22
and at what time, as opposed
to having mandates that kind


642
0:31:56,22 --> 0:31:59,26
of dictate how healthcare
should look like.


643
0:31:59,26 --> 0:32:2,46
I'm I'm a bel- I believe
in decentralized government


644
0:32:2,46 --> 0:32:5,63
where whether you're talking
about, you know, education,


645
0:32:5,63 --> 0:32:11,9
healthcare, that power basically
flows to, to local communities


646
0:32:11,9 --> 0:32:13,28
because people have
different needs


647
0:32:13,28 --> 0:32:16,6
in different parts
of our country.


648
0:32:16,6 --> 0:32:18,8
So there's obviously
a looming crisis.


649
0:32:18,8 --> 0:32:21,83
You look at, as a percentage
of our national budget,


650
0:32:21,83 --> 0:32:23,8
and this has been the
discussion of the Medicare


651
0:32:23,8 --> 0:32:28,26
and Medicaid discussion,
entitlements are roughly 60%


652
0:32:28,26 --> 0:32:31,9
of our of our total budget
and healthcare represents


653
0:32:31,9 --> 0:32:32,98
about a third of that.


654
0:32:32,98 --> 0:32:36,2
And so again it's similar
to the question about,


655
0:32:36,2 --> 0:32:37,55
you know, Texas education.


656
0:32:37,55 --> 0:32:41,3
You know you really can't
talk about reducing the size


657
0:32:41,3 --> 0:32:42,94
of our debt without
talking about healthcare,


658
0:32:42,94 --> 0:32:45,9
so you know we really have a lot


659
0:32:45,9 --> 0:32:48,8
of important decisions
ahead of us.


660
0:32:48,8 --> 0:32:50,77
Thankfully I'm not in politics
so I don't have to worry,


661
0:32:50,77 --> 0:32:52,88
worry as much about it.


662
0:32:52,88 --> 0:32:54,48
>> Hi my name's Jennifer.


663
0:32:54,48 --> 0:32:56,43
Actually I will be moving
to Baltimore after this


664
0:32:56,43 --> 0:32:57,48
and doing Teach for America.


665
0:32:57,48 --> 0:32:58,22
So I'm really excited
about that--


666
0:32:58,22 --> 0:32:59,1
>> Congratulations.


667
0:32:59,1 --> 0:32:59,75
That's awesome.


668
0:32:59,75 --> 0:33:0,23
>> Thank you.


669
0:33:0,23 --> 0:33:0,68
Thank you.


670
0:33:0,68 --> 0:33:2,69
But my question,
you were talking


671
0:33:2,69 --> 0:33:7,12
about I guess training
different schools


672
0:33:7,12 --> 0:33:9,47
to do I guess vocational
opportunities for students,


673
0:33:9,47 --> 0:33:13,7
but I think my concern with
that would be getting teachers


674
0:33:13,7 --> 0:33:17,66
or counselors who automatically
assume minorities would


675
0:33:17,66 --> 0:33:20,17
eventually go that route and
not give them the opportunity


676
0:33:20,17 --> 0:33:22,5
for them to actually
excel in their studies.


677
0:33:22,5 --> 0:33:22,4
>> Yeah.


678
0:33:22,4 --> 0:33:25,84
>> So my question for you
would be, how would you prevent


679
0:33:25,84 --> 0:33:27,18
that from happening
for students?


680
0:33:27,18 --> 0:33:29,92
Instead of, you know, giving
them a chance to succeed


681
0:33:29,92 --> 0:33:31,75
in school in their
studies versus, you know,


682
0:33:31,75 --> 0:33:35,29
just automatically assuming
a vocational route for them?


683
0:33:35,29 --> 0:33:35,89
>> Absolutely.


684
0:33:35,89 --> 0:33:37,67
That's a great, a great point


685
0:33:37,67 --> 0:33:41,25
and a great question 'cause
it can't be a self-selecting


686
0:33:41,25 --> 0:33:44,98
criteria mainly because of
your background as a student


687
0:33:44,98 --> 0:33:46,99
and what community
you reside in.


688
0:33:46,99 --> 0:33:51,75
It would be an opt in program
where basically teachers


689
0:33:51,75 --> 0:33:53,85
and the students,
basically would have to make


690
0:33:53,85 --> 0:33:57,14
that that decision together
as a joint decision as opposed


691
0:33:57,14 --> 0:34:0,56
to you know some higher
power from Austin,


692
0:34:0,56 --> 0:34:2,97
Texas or Washington,
D.C. deeming you


693
0:34:2,97 --> 0:34:5,66
to be a kid who's going on
a certain, certain track


694
0:34:5,66 --> 0:34:7,53
as opposed to one
that you desire.


695
0:34:7,53 --> 0:34:11,75
So I I probably should
clarify that in terms of,


696
0:34:11,75 --> 0:34:14,88
in terms of having a curriculum
that's more relevant to the


697
0:34:14,88 --> 0:34:17,8
to the to the lives of those.


698
0:34:17,8 --> 0:34:19,46
I I just think that there's
a wonderful opportunity


699
0:34:19,46 --> 0:34:23,39
to to re-approach education in a
way that there's an open canvas


700
0:34:23,39 --> 0:34:28,42
in which we really delve into
the interests of of students and


701
0:34:28,42 --> 0:34:32,82
and creating the bridge between
growing up in the community


702
0:34:32,82 --> 0:34:35,72
and going off to a
job of the future.


703
0:34:35,72 --> 0:34:39,59
Because even though we have more
4 to 500 companies in this state


704
0:34:39,59 --> 0:34:42,47
than any other state
in the country,


705
0:34:42,47 --> 0:34:46,2
in other words there's a lot of
opportunity out there, we still,


706
0:34:46,2 --> 0:34:49,48
in my opinion have not created
a pipeline by which dir-


707
0:34:49,48 --> 0:34:53,12
where where these students
can go on and get those jobs


708
0:34:53,12 --> 0:34:55,93
of the future that, for
companies that are innovative


709
0:34:55,93 --> 0:34:57,18
and going out and creating.


710
0:34:57,18 --> 0:34:58,72
I mean Facebook for
example, they're,


711
0:34:58,72 --> 0:35:1,2
they've just moved a large
office here to Austin


712
0:35:1,2 --> 0:35:1,96
which is really exciting


713
0:35:1,96 --> 0:35:5,88
and they're they're gonna bring
I think roughly 1,500 employees.


714
0:35:5,88 --> 0:35:10,88
Legalzoom.com, Zynga, and so
what's happening here in Austin


715
0:35:10,88 --> 0:35:14,63
on the tech side of things is
really exciting back to your,


716
0:35:14,63 --> 0:35:17,25
your question earlier
about whether,


717
0:35:17,25 --> 0:35:19,51
whether we can embrace
technology and if a kid early


718
0:35:19,51 --> 0:35:22,48
on demonstrates an interest in
saying that's the company I want


719
0:35:22,48 --> 0:35:24,65
to work for, I want to work
for Facebook and I want


720
0:35:24,65 --> 0:35:27,27
to be CEO one day,
creating a curriculum


721
0:35:27,27 --> 0:35:29,84
that would allow a kid, instead
of learning about, you know,


722
0:35:29,84 --> 0:35:33,95
medieval, and I'm a history
major, medieval military history


723
0:35:33,95 --> 0:35:36,16
or something wouldn't
be the most relevant


724
0:35:36,16 --> 0:35:36,97
to getting that job.


725
0:35:36,97 --> 0:35:41,33
So, so creating a structure I
think that's flexible would be,


726
0:35:41,33 --> 0:35:43,69
would be ideal.


727
0:35:43,69 --> 0:35:46,7
>> Hi my name is Perla Roman,
I'm from Houston, Texas.


728
0:35:46,7 --> 0:35:50,45
I have a question about
immigration and education.


729
0:35:50,45 --> 0:35:52,15
As I personally have
friends who have dropped


730
0:35:52,15 --> 0:35:54,64
out of high school claiming that
they can't pursue a career or go


731
0:35:54,64 --> 0:35:56,95
to college because of
their legal status,


732
0:35:56,95 --> 0:35:58,68
so I would like to
know what's your stand


733
0:35:58,68 --> 0:36:3,5
on granting illegal immigrant
students citizenship?


734
0:36:3,5 --> 0:36:5,89
>> Well there's been a
proposal that was pending


735
0:36:5,89 --> 0:36:8,34
in congress called
the the dream act


736
0:36:8,34 --> 0:36:11,21
which would allow the children


737
0:36:11,21 --> 0:36:18,13
of undocumented immigrants the
ability to obtain state citizen,


738
0:36:18,13 --> 0:36:22,8
state citizens, same tuition
as as state kids basically,


739
0:36:22,8 --> 0:36:26,4
in state tuition is
what I'm trying to say.


740
0:36:26,4 --> 0:36:27,82
And that was recently,


741
0:36:27,82 --> 0:36:30,33
it's basically scuttled
in the senate.


742
0:36:30,33 --> 0:36:33,22
I think there's ways, there's
there's a middle ground 'cause


743
0:36:33,22 --> 0:36:35,64
obviously it's a very
competitive education


744
0:36:35,64 --> 0:36:38,11
environment and there are
families here in Texas


745
0:36:38,11 --> 0:36:40,83
who feel slighted that children


746
0:36:40,83 --> 0:36:45,22
of undocumented immigrants get
the same pay in price point as,


747
0:36:45,22 --> 0:36:48,15
as an in state person.


748
0:36:48,15 --> 0:36:50,52
I I think there's litmus,
there's a litmus test.


749
0:36:50,52 --> 0:36:53,11
Instead of looking at it
as you know black and white


750
0:36:53,11 --> 0:36:54,51
that there's a spectrum there.


751
0:36:54,51 --> 0:36:59,7
So if if, if an undocumented
family, if let's say,


752
0:36:59,7 --> 0:37:2,23
and I'm just talking out
loud here 'cause, you know,


753
0:37:2,23 --> 0:37:4,67
this is UT and we think
creatively, is that,


754
0:37:4,67 --> 0:37:8,33
is that you know if the
parents demonstrate an ability


755
0:37:8,33 --> 0:37:12,88
to pay back taxes, have
taxes with withheld


756
0:37:12,88 --> 0:37:15,99
on a going forward basis so
they're paying into the system,


757
0:37:15,99 --> 0:37:17,54
so there's less kind of concern


758
0:37:17,54 --> 0:37:22,23
about where you know public
funding stands in terms of,


759
0:37:22,23 --> 0:37:25,53
where the kid stands and what
they're what they're taking


760
0:37:25,53 --> 0:37:27,46
from the system,
and they demonstrate


761
0:37:27,46 --> 0:37:28,88
over a certain amount
of years a,


762
0:37:28,88 --> 0:37:33,78
a kind of a continuous
occupation


763
0:37:33,78 --> 0:37:36,85
and you know there's fluency
in English and that there's,


764
0:37:36,85 --> 0:37:41,45
you know, no commission
of felony, felonies during


765
0:37:41,45 --> 0:37:44,34
that time, that we're
beginning to move in a direction


766
0:37:44,34 --> 0:37:46,78
where I think we should
allow for in state tuition


767
0:37:46,78 --> 0:37:48,42
because again it goes
back to the issue


768
0:37:48,42 --> 0:37:54,68
about how we make changes
to to our education system


769
0:37:54,68 --> 0:37:58,22
and creating incentives by which
we have very talented people


770
0:37:58,22 --> 0:38:2,16
that were, had no control
over where they're,


771
0:38:2,16 --> 0:38:4,5
where they were born and
where they were educated


772
0:38:4,5 --> 0:38:6,2
and what their legal status is.


773
0:38:6,2 --> 0:38:7,61
So there's, there's a,


774
0:38:7,61 --> 0:38:11,5
many people in immigration
unfortunately view it as a black


775
0:38:11,5 --> 0:38:14,59
and white issues and republicans
are just as guilty as democrats


776
0:38:14,59 --> 0:38:18,57
in that issue for being not
constructive in this debate.


777
0:38:18,57 --> 0:38:21,23
There are 20 million
undocumented immigrants


778
0:38:21,23 --> 0:38:22,36
that live in our country today.


779
0:38:22,36 --> 0:38:23,76
This is another issue
that we as a ge-


780
0:38:23,76 --> 0:38:27,58
as our generation will face and
how do, and they're having kids,


781
0:38:27,58 --> 0:38:29,92
they're having a lot of kids.


782
0:38:29,92 --> 0:38:31,98
You know in the Anglo community,


783
0:38:31,98 --> 0:38:36,45
the average child per
family is is less than 2.1


784
0:38:36,45 --> 0:38:40,33
which is roughly the amount you
need to you know keep your pa-


785
0:38:40,33 --> 0:38:41,97
your population growing.


786
0:38:41,97 --> 0:38:43,63
And among the Hispanic
community it's,


787
0:38:43,63 --> 0:38:46,42
it's it's above that,
which is great.


788
0:38:46,42 --> 0:38:48,68
We need to embrace, you know,


789
0:38:48,68 --> 0:38:51,51
we need to embrace a
vibrant immigrant community,


790
0:38:51,51 --> 0:38:54,56
that's what our country
was built on and,


791
0:38:54,56 --> 0:38:57,19
and you I think there's there's
gotta be incentives there


792
0:38:57,19 --> 0:39:1,49
for the kids that want to
get a higher education.


793
0:39:1,49 --> 0:39:4,32
So I'm, again I'm glad
I don't have to deal


794
0:39:4,32 --> 0:39:7,51
with that issue 'cause I think
it's a complicated one but,


795
0:39:7,51 --> 0:39:10,4
because when people talk about
immigration it touch- touches


796
0:39:10,4 --> 0:39:13,66
on every issue indirectly
-- education, healthcare,


797
0:39:13,66 --> 0:39:17,25
national security,
drug trafficking.


798
0:39:17,25 --> 0:39:22,21
So, but I'm I'm for
proposals like the dream act.


799
0:39:22,21 --> 0:39:25,69
I think it's it's a wonderful
incentive to make sure


800
0:39:25,69 --> 0:39:28,9
that there are incentives there


801
0:39:28,9 --> 0:39:31,94
to get a higher education we
shouldn't be dis- discouraging.


802
0:39:31,94 --> 0:41:31,94
