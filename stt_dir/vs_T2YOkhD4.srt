1
0:0:2,327 --> 0:0:9,567
Nothing. Nothing.
Nothing. Nothing.


2
0:0:9,567 --> 0:0:13,807
l can see.


3
0:0:13,807 --> 0:0:17,487
Come on. Let's get out of here.
There's something to do.


4
0:0:17,487 --> 0:0:20,727
There's film festivals,
theatre, there's museums.


5
0:0:20,727 --> 0:0:23,287
Let's get out and get some culture.


6
0:0:23,287 --> 0:0:25,247
Let's put Rowdy on top of the TV


7
0:0:25,247 --> 0:0:27,727
and see who can
throw a hat on him first.


8
0:0:27,727 --> 0:0:30,927
<i>Turk turns everything</i>
<i>into a competition,</i>


9
0:0:30,927 --> 0:0:35,7
<i>It can get annoying,</i>


10
0:0:35,7 --> 0:0:37,87
Let's play ''Steak''.


11
0:0:37,87 --> 0:0:40,287
The first person
to finish their steak is the winner.


12
0:0:40,287 --> 0:0:44,407
l paid $1 7 for this steak,
and l'm not...


13
0:0:44,407 --> 0:0:48,407
You want some?


14
0:0:48,407 --> 0:0:50,407
''Ankles'' is a simple game.


15
0:0:50,407 --> 0:0:54,407
The first one to get embarrassed
and pull up their scrubs loses.


16
0:0:54,407 --> 0:1:0,247
<i>The problem is these stupid games</i>
<i>always end the same way,</i>


17
0:1:0,247 --> 0:1:3,607
Say it!


18
0:1:3,607 --> 0:1:9,247
Say it!


19
0:1:9,247 --> 0:1:11,767
Just say it.


20
0:1:11,767 --> 0:1:14,607
- l'm your bitch.
- Yes, you are.


21
0:1:14,607 --> 0:1:33,207
Now, sit back baby,
cos <i>Iron Chef</i> is on.


22
0:1:33,207 --> 0:1:35,167
- l win.
- l wasn't racing.


23
0:1:35,167 --> 0:1:37,847
- l was just walking in.
- Good clean win, T-Dog.


24
0:1:37,847 --> 0:1:41,767
Now, let's go down to the caf
and get our doughnut on.


25
0:1:41,767 --> 0:1:43,607
lt wasn't a race!


26
0:1:43,607 --> 0:1:46,487
OK, fine!
Let's just play...


27
0:1:46,487 --> 0:1:48,567
Let's play
''Tip Over the Trash Can''.


28
0:1:48,567 --> 0:1:52,447
OK? l win.


29
0:1:52,447 --> 0:1:59,287
- l win.
- Can l play?


30
0:1:59,287 --> 0:2:3,7
- This is fun.
- Yeah.


31
0:2:3,7 --> 0:2:15,567
Sorry to keep you, Mr Kelly.
l was just...


32
0:2:15,567 --> 0:2:19,327
So, what, are you sick or something?


33
0:2:19,327 --> 0:2:22,887
My heartbeat, it's like,
it's irregular.


34
0:2:22,887 --> 0:2:25,247
- What's the medical word?
- lrregular.


35
0:2:25,247 --> 0:2:27,47
Yeah. That's it.


36
0:2:27,47 --> 0:2:31,327
Of course. The heart.
The old ticker.


37
0:2:31,327 --> 0:2:33,247
You're my doctor?


38
0:2:33,247 --> 0:2:36,527
l have something for you in my pants.


39
0:2:36,527 --> 0:2:38,447
No. Not...


40
0:2:38,447 --> 0:2:40,727
l'm not wearing any pants right now.


41
0:2:40,727 --> 0:2:47,807
My pants are over there, and there's
a note from my GP in the pocket.


42
0:2:47,807 --> 0:2:50,367
lf you guys need me, l'll be under here.


43
0:2:50,367 --> 0:2:55,447
l'm in love with that guy and if l don't
sleep with him, l'll kill myself.


44
0:2:55,447 --> 0:2:58,327
lt's inappropriate
to jump a patient, isn't it?


45
0:2:58,327 --> 0:2:59,967
- Totally.
- Ever done it?


46
0:2:59,967 --> 0:3:2,327
- Tons of times.
- ''Tons of times'' what?


47
0:3:2,327 --> 0:3:5,127
Nothing, baby.


48
0:3:5,127 --> 0:3:8,887
Why hasn't he had a surgical consult?
l'm sorry. That's my fault.


49
0:3:8,887 --> 0:3:13,487
l didn't make it clear how l feel about
things that should already be done.


50
0:3:13,487 --> 0:3:17,207
l almost always wish
things were done already.


51
0:3:17,207 --> 0:3:20,127
Mr Hoffner asked for all his options.


52
0:3:20,127 --> 0:3:24,167
- He never asked for a surgical consult.
- Could l have a surgical consult?


53
0:3:24,167 --> 0:3:28,927
You may have whatever you want.


54
0:3:28,927 --> 0:3:32,727
How is that helpful? Do you get
the doctor-patient relationship?


55
0:3:32,727 --> 0:3:34,687
We're supposed to be a team.


56
0:3:34,687 --> 0:3:41,767
You and me? We're gonna get killed.


57
0:3:41,767 --> 0:3:45,967
For the love of Our Lady
of Guadalupe, that is a fine brew.


58
0:3:45,967 --> 0:3:48,287
- lt's just coffee.
- Oh, no.


59
0:3:48,287 --> 0:3:51,887
This is liquid crack.
This is a mug full of sunshine.


60
0:3:51,887 --> 0:3:55,47
My dear, for me, this is like sex.


61
0:3:55,47 --> 0:3:58,87
ls that why you always
finish so quickly?


62
0:3:58,87 --> 0:4:0,487
And sassy too.
lf you could cook a steak,


63
0:4:0,487 --> 0:4:2,727
l'd eat it right off your bottom.


64
0:4:2,727 --> 0:4:8,7
Ladies. This is that beverage
l've been trying to describe to you,


65
0:4:8,7 --> 0:4:10,327
and it turns out, this is weird,


66
0:4:10,327 --> 0:4:13,927
but the secret is,
you grind it from beans, not crap.


67
0:4:13,927 --> 0:4:16,167
l'll grind your beans.


68
0:4:16,167 --> 0:4:19,47
When are we gonna get it over with?


69
0:4:19,47 --> 0:4:24,47
We are already understaffed, and
Dr Kelso fired two nurses for no reason.


70
0:4:24,47 --> 0:4:28,967
Forgive us if we don't have time
for the Dr Cox show today.


71
0:4:28,967 --> 0:4:31,167
We have to reschedule every nurse.


72
0:4:31,167 --> 0:4:34,287
- What'll we do about lCU...
- We don't need them.


73
0:4:34,287 --> 0:4:37,7
<i>Here's the problem</i>
<i>with a surgical consult,</i>


74
0:4:37,7 --> 0:4:41,687
<i>Mr Hoffner should be treated medically</i>
<i>but a surgeon will want to slice him,</i>


75
0:4:41,687 --> 0:4:45,567
<i>Surgical and medical interns</i>
<i>are like two rival gangs,</i>


76
0:4:45,567 --> 0:5:8,167
<i>Not real gangs, More like those cheesy</i>
<i>gangs you see in Broadway musicals,</i>


77
0:5:8,167 --> 0:5:11,887
<i>Surgical medical surgical yeah!</i>


78
0:5:11,887 --> 0:5:19,47
<i>Still I knew there was</i>
<i>one surgical intern I could count on,</i>


79
0:5:19,47 --> 0:5:22,887
<i>If you have some moles</i>
<i>I will inspect them</i>


80
0:5:22,887 --> 0:5:26,727
<i>I'll remove tumours from</i>
<i>your brain to your rectum</i>


81
0:5:26,727 --> 0:5:30,367
<i>Between the two of us</i>
<i>there is no wall</i>


82
0:5:30,367 --> 0:5:32,687
<i>We're a surgeon and a doc</i>


83
0:5:32,687 --> 0:5:38,647
<i>Above it all</i>


84
0:5:38,647 --> 0:5:40,607
<i>A surgeon and a doc</i>


85
0:5:40,607 --> 0:5:44,767
<i>Above it</i>


86
0:5:44,767 --> 0:5:47,887
<i>All</i>


87
0:5:47,887 --> 0:5:59,447
No problem. Whatever you want me
to tell your patient, l'm your guy.


88
0:5:59,447 --> 0:6:2,887
- How are you feeling?
- l'm not tired.


89
0:6:2,887 --> 0:6:5,927
Stress tests are supposed to be hard.


90
0:6:5,927 --> 0:6:8,967
lt helps if you visualise
running toward something,


91
0:6:8,967 --> 0:6:11,887
- like your girlfriend.
- l don't have a girlfriend.


92
0:6:11,887 --> 0:6:14,7
How could you possibly be single?


93
0:6:14,7 --> 0:6:16,727
l don't know.
l'm kind of anal and neurotic.


94
0:6:16,727 --> 0:6:18,647
My God. Me too.


95
0:6:18,647 --> 0:6:20,7
- Really?
- Please!


96
0:6:20,7 --> 0:6:23,447
l like to keep my pens in order
from least to most ink.


97
0:6:23,447 --> 0:6:27,407
That is hot.
l guess the truth is that


98
0:6:27,407 --> 0:6:29,487
l don't go out a lot, you know?


99
0:6:29,487 --> 0:6:31,607
l always seem to
put my foot in my mouth.


100
0:6:31,607 --> 0:6:34,207
l'd let you put your foot in my mouth.


101
0:6:34,207 --> 0:6:36,687
What?


102
0:6:36,687 --> 0:6:39,247
l said l'd let you put
your foot in my mouth.


103
0:6:39,247 --> 0:6:41,807
That's weird.


104
0:6:41,807 --> 0:6:51,127
l know.


105
0:6:51,127 --> 0:7:1,847
Who gets to tell us the symptoms
of Ménière's disease?


106
0:7:1,847 --> 0:7:5,847
- Dr Murphy.
- Can you use it in a sentence?


107
0:7:5,847 --> 0:7:8,687
Sorry to interrupt you there,


108
0:7:8,687 --> 0:7:12,687
but l gotta ask you a quick question.
Now, when you were born, nay,


109
0:7:12,687 --> 0:7:14,807
spawned by the Dark Prince himself,


110
0:7:14,807 --> 0:7:18,807
did he forget to give you a hug
before he sent you along your way?


111
0:7:18,807 --> 0:7:23,87
Because you can't just let nurses go
on account of feeling insignificant.


112
0:7:23,87 --> 0:7:25,287
And besides, with your money,


113
0:7:25,287 --> 0:7:28,647
you ought to be able to keep a man
tucked away in the closet


114
0:7:28,647 --> 0:7:33,207
and bring him out when you want to
knock him around.


115
0:7:33,207 --> 0:7:39,7
As you were.


116
0:7:39,7 --> 0:7:42,7
Doug, look away.


117
0:7:42,7 --> 0:7:47,527
l can't.


118
0:7:47,527 --> 0:7:51,487
- What are you serving for dinner?
- That's not really my area.


119
0:7:51,487 --> 0:7:53,127
l'd like chicken.


120
0:7:53,127 --> 0:7:56,727
Mr Hoffner,
here's your surgical consult.


121
0:7:56,727 --> 0:8:2,167
But he's gonna agree with the medical
course l set for you. Now, Dr Turk,


122
0:8:2,167 --> 0:8:5,847
tell Mr Hoffner whether or not
you think he should have surgery.


123
0:8:5,847 --> 0:8:7,927
l think he should have surgery.


124
0:8:7,927 --> 0:8:10,927
<i>The important thing</i>
<i>is that we're professionals</i>


125
0:8:10,927 --> 0:8:17,967
<i>and we should behave as such</i>
<i>in front of the patient,</i>


126
0:8:17,967 --> 0:8:20,967
No! Tell me he did not fire her.


127
0:8:20,967 --> 0:8:25,127
You had to show up Kelso
and now another nurse is out of a job.


128
0:8:25,127 --> 0:8:27,607
- l went to confront...
- Am l done?


129
0:8:27,607 --> 0:8:29,87
You don't look done.


130
0:8:29,87 --> 0:8:32,447
- You know what your problem is?
- l put myself...


131
0:8:32,447 --> 0:8:35,727
Who answers that question?
That is your problem.


132
0:8:35,727 --> 0:8:38,407
You think you have
the answers to everything,


133
0:8:38,407 --> 0:8:42,847
but end up throwing gas on the fire,
and everyone pays the consequences.


134
0:8:42,847 --> 0:8:45,167
That's what l was going to say.


135
0:8:45,167 --> 0:8:47,567
Carla, can l talk to you for a second?


136
0:8:47,567 --> 0:8:49,847
My God, Barbie needs you.


137
0:8:49,847 --> 0:8:56,127
To be continued.


138
0:8:56,127 --> 0:9:0,447
Why hasn't he asked me out? l'm single.
l mentioned five movies l want to see.


139
0:9:0,447 --> 0:9:3,647
l drop things so when l pick them up,
he can see l'm flexible.


140
0:9:3,647 --> 0:9:7,247
Elliot, these things
take time and self-respect.


141
0:9:7,247 --> 0:9:9,167
So we're going to focus on time.


142
0:9:9,167 --> 0:9:12,687
- Nobody likes me when they meet me.
- Exactly!


143
0:9:12,687 --> 0:9:14,967
l'm helping.


144
0:9:14,967 --> 0:9:19,607
- We've got all the time in the world.
- Right.


145
0:9:19,607 --> 0:9:21,687
- No.
- l knew it.


146
0:9:21,687 --> 0:9:25,7
l'm dying.
l was exhausted on that treadmill.


147
0:9:25,7 --> 0:9:27,727
l should have said something.
But l never do.


148
0:9:27,727 --> 0:9:32,687
Not when it comes to my well-being.
And now l'm getting a pig heart.


149
0:9:32,687 --> 0:9:34,887
You're perfect.


150
0:9:34,887 --> 0:9:38,647
You're free to go. Today.


151
0:9:38,647 --> 0:9:46,7
- That seems like good news.
- Best news ever.


152
0:9:46,7 --> 0:9:49,927
Dropped my clipboard.
l'll just...


153
0:9:49,927 --> 0:9:53,687
Do l need to sign something?


154
0:9:53,687 --> 0:9:58,487
- You were going to back me up.
- He's had colitis for ten years.


155
0:9:58,487 --> 0:10:2,487
And no girlfriends.
lt's a gassy disease.


156
0:10:2,487 --> 0:10:7,287
- You can't consider it a reoccurrence.
- He's high risk for colon cancer.


157
0:10:7,287 --> 0:10:10,287
- Give him frequent colonoscopies.
- How frequent?


158
0:10:10,287 --> 0:10:12,727
You're turning this into a competition.


159
0:10:12,727 --> 0:10:15,567
Luckily, it's not up to you.
lt's up to Mr Hoffner.


160
0:10:15,567 --> 0:10:17,127
l'm going with surgery.


161
0:10:17,127 --> 0:10:20,87
- You're getting meat for dinner.
- l eat chicken.


162
0:10:20,87 --> 0:10:34,7
l'll set it up.


163
0:10:34,7 --> 0:10:40,247
- Say it!
- l'm your bitch.


164
0:10:40,247 --> 0:10:42,407
<i>I'm not gonna let Turk beat me,</i>


165
0:10:42,407 --> 0:10:45,127
<i>I'm gonna fight back</i>
<i>and you want to know how?</i>


166
0:10:45,127 --> 0:10:46,607
<i>I'm telling,</i>


167
0:10:46,607 --> 0:10:49,927
Dr Cox?


168
0:10:49,927 --> 0:10:52,207
He stole my patient.


169
0:10:52,207 --> 0:10:55,407
And then, and then...


170
0:10:55,407 --> 0:10:57,807
lt's OK, Jumbo.


171
0:10:57,807 --> 0:11:1,367
Now, who's my big boy?


172
0:11:1,367 --> 0:11:3,927
- l am!
- You're my big boy!


173
0:11:3,927 --> 0:11:6,247
- You're my big boy.
- l'm your big...


174
0:11:6,247 --> 0:11:10,567
Good God, newbie, do you think
you're the only one with problems here?


175
0:11:10,567 --> 0:11:13,767
Give me a break. Watch this.
Pick a nurse, any nurse.


176
0:11:13,767 --> 0:11:17,247
Laverne, when you get a chance,
could you grab a file for me?


177
0:11:17,247 --> 0:11:19,687
- Grab these.
- Rough all over.


178
0:11:19,687 --> 0:11:23,327
So don't talk to me, Joanie.
Just go talk to your patient.


179
0:11:23,327 --> 0:11:28,127
Go.


180
0:11:28,127 --> 0:11:30,887
- What's up, Benedict?
- What?


181
0:11:30,887 --> 0:11:32,327
Benedict Arnold?


182
0:11:32,327 --> 0:11:37,207
- That's the lamest smack talk.
- That's not what the redcoats thought.


183
0:11:37,207 --> 0:11:39,7
You went colonial on his ass.


184
0:11:39,7 --> 0:11:42,247
So you're gonna go under the knife
just cos he told you to?


185
0:11:42,247 --> 0:11:46,327
- No, l spoke to some other people.
- Like who?


186
0:11:46,327 --> 0:11:48,847
All fixed.


187
0:11:48,847 --> 0:12:3,207
- He's a janitor.
- Yeah, but he seems confident.


188
0:12:3,207 --> 0:12:5,927
What are you gonna do,
take a swing at me?


189
0:12:5,927 --> 0:12:11,407
- Maybe.
- Well, if you do, l'd better die.


190
0:12:11,407 --> 0:12:14,647
Because if l don't,
l will be coming for you.


191
0:12:14,647 --> 0:12:16,727
Good cake today.


192
0:12:16,727 --> 0:12:21,207
You fired a dear, dear friend of mine.
That woman was like family.


193
0:12:21,207 --> 0:12:27,167
- Who?
- l'll tell you who.


194
0:12:27,167 --> 0:12:28,487
Coffee Nurse.


195
0:12:28,487 --> 0:12:32,367
When you fired Coffee Nurse,
you made this whole thing personal.


196
0:12:32,367 --> 0:12:34,7
No, you made it personal.


197
0:12:34,7 --> 0:12:36,967
You gave me lip yesterday
in front of the interns.


198
0:12:36,967 --> 0:12:39,847
You know why l laid off
those first two nurses?


199
0:12:39,847 --> 0:12:44,567
Budgetary constraints forced a cut,
and those two had negative reports.


200
0:12:44,567 --> 0:12:49,407
And you think l did it
to make myself happy.


201
0:12:49,407 --> 0:12:52,647
l wouldn't notice
if they all caught on fire.


202
0:12:52,647 --> 0:12:56,167
Then why in God's name
did you axe Coffee Nurse?


203
0:12:56,167 --> 0:12:58,247
Because you were being an ass.


204
0:12:58,247 --> 0:13:3,487
You're right, that was personal.
My bad.


205
0:13:3,487 --> 0:13:12,87
Golly, l do love moist cake.


206
0:13:12,87 --> 0:13:14,967
Where are you going?
You're not off 'til midnight.


207
0:13:14,967 --> 0:13:18,487
lt's my last chance,
and Sean's only seen me skanked out.


208
0:13:18,487 --> 0:13:20,927
Does it look like l'm trying too hard?


209
0:13:20,927 --> 0:13:23,367
No. Do you need me
to ice up your nipples?


210
0:13:23,367 --> 0:13:33,87
- What would that do?
- Go get him, tiger.


211
0:13:33,87 --> 0:13:43,7
Dr Reid, we need help
with one of your patients.


212
0:13:43,7 --> 0:13:47,407
l'm just a janitor. l don't know much.
But l do know this:


213
0:13:47,407 --> 0:13:49,487
You need surgery.


214
0:13:49,487 --> 0:14:1,567
<i>What?</i>


215
0:14:1,567 --> 0:14:4,127
How's it going?


216
0:14:4,127 --> 0:14:7,47
lt's good. Yeah, it's good.


217
0:14:7,47 --> 0:14:9,87
You have something on your cheek.


218
0:14:9,87 --> 0:14:13,447
Yeah, that's just...


219
0:14:13,447 --> 0:14:15,927
That's poo.


220
0:14:15,927 --> 0:14:18,207
You know what they say, right?


221
0:14:18,207 --> 0:14:21,7
Because everybody poops. l just did.


222
0:14:21,7 --> 0:14:25,167
Earlier. Not this second.
But down there, l pooped.


223
0:14:25,167 --> 0:14:28,407
That is so cool
that you can just talk about it.


224
0:14:28,407 --> 0:14:30,527
Really?


225
0:14:30,527 --> 0:14:33,447
Yeah, l love to poop.


226
0:14:33,447 --> 0:14:35,687
Dr Dorian, present your patient.


227
0:14:35,687 --> 0:14:37,647
Yes, sir.


228
0:14:37,647 --> 0:14:40,127
The patient presented in DKA,


229
0:14:40,127 --> 0:14:43,7
which is why l've started him
on an insulin drip...


230
0:14:43,7 --> 0:14:47,7
Don't bother.
l'm gonna go in for surgery.


231
0:14:47,7 --> 0:14:49,7
Me too.


232
0:14:49,7 --> 0:14:52,207
l'm having surgery right now,
and loving it.


233
0:14:52,207 --> 0:14:55,527
Let's get you out of your skin.


234
0:14:55,527 --> 0:15:4,247
Bob, could l talk to you for a sec?


235
0:15:4,247 --> 0:15:7,807
Can l let my mind wander,
or are we doing something?


236
0:15:7,807 --> 0:15:11,327
l just wanted to say that l'm...


237
0:15:11,327 --> 0:15:14,207
- l'm sorry.
- Holy crap.


238
0:15:14,207 --> 0:15:16,887
My bad behaviour is my own doing.


239
0:15:16,887 --> 0:15:19,887
l don't think a nurse should
suffer on account of it.


240
0:15:19,887 --> 0:15:24,127
- Then l'll make it right...
- Thank you.


241
0:15:24,127 --> 0:15:28,367
...if you will apologise again
so the interns can hear.


242
0:15:28,367 --> 0:15:33,727
Your call, Perry.


243
0:15:33,727 --> 0:15:35,807
Dr Kelso.


244
0:15:35,807 --> 0:15:44,47
l'm sorry. l was wrong.


245
0:15:44,47 --> 0:15:54,47
- Doug, for God's sakes.
- l don't care. lt's beautiful, man.


246
0:15:54,47 --> 0:15:57,567
l cannot believe l talked to Sean
about poo for ten minutes.


247
0:15:57,567 --> 0:16:1,87
- Relax. Nobody knows.
- Hey, Poopie.


248
0:16:1,87 --> 0:16:3,807
At one point,
l tried changing the subject to art.


249
0:16:3,807 --> 0:16:8,167
But we went from art to artists
to alcohol to coffee,


250
0:16:8,167 --> 0:16:11,287
and that just led right back to poo.


251
0:16:11,287 --> 0:16:16,7
You know the saying, ''No one will love
you until you learn to love yourself'?


252
0:16:16,7 --> 0:16:18,687
My mother used to say,
''No one will love you''.


253
0:16:18,687 --> 0:16:22,327
Fake it. Don't let him see
what a neurotic mess you are.


254
0:16:22,327 --> 0:16:25,447
You see Turk over there?


255
0:16:25,447 --> 0:16:31,407
He doesn't know l cry sometimes because
l'm not sure there's a cat heaven.


256
0:16:31,407 --> 0:16:36,287
lt's hiding the crazy and acting like
the most confident girl in the room.


257
0:16:36,287 --> 0:16:39,967
No problem.


258
0:16:39,967 --> 0:16:45,247
<i>I too decided it was time to act</i>
<i>confident and face things head-on,</i>


259
0:16:45,247 --> 0:16:49,127
That was my patient, Turk.
l brought you in as my friend.


260
0:16:49,127 --> 0:16:53,327
You're so competitive, you just
take him from me? That sucks.


261
0:16:53,327 --> 0:16:55,887
- Tough.
- Excuse me?


262
0:16:55,887 --> 0:16:59,927
You're damn right l'm competitive.
That's what makes me a good doctor.


263
0:16:59,927 --> 0:17:3,807
l want to win at everything,
every day, and you should too.


264
0:17:3,807 --> 0:17:6,47
That sounds like a great friendship.


265
0:17:6,47 --> 0:17:11,407
lf you don't want to play ''Steak'', fine.
This has nothing to do with friendship.


266
0:17:11,407 --> 0:17:17,287
You're angry at yourself because you
couldn't get the guy to believe in you.


267
0:17:17,287 --> 0:17:20,247
He never got the concept of the team.


268
0:17:20,247 --> 0:17:22,887
l know.


269
0:17:22,887 --> 0:17:28,807
Have a cookie, man.


270
0:17:28,807 --> 0:17:32,607
- l win at ''Cookie''?
- Yeah.


271
0:17:32,607 --> 0:17:36,567
- Thanks again, sir.
- No matter what the board says,


272
0:17:36,567 --> 0:17:42,527
l'm not going to let someone like you
get away. Not without a fight.


273
0:17:42,527 --> 0:17:46,767
You think she doesn't see through you?
These people know who really cares.


274
0:17:46,767 --> 0:17:50,967
- You and Jennifer are pretty tight?
- Hell, yeah.


275
0:17:50,967 --> 0:17:53,647
Jenny. Gosh, l'm glad you're back.


276
0:17:53,647 --> 0:17:58,47
Thanks. My name's Patti.


277
0:17:58,47 --> 0:18:5,527
Fool.


278
0:18:5,527 --> 0:18:12,527
Sean?


279
0:18:12,527 --> 0:18:17,807
Sean, wait.


280
0:18:17,807 --> 0:18:20,527
- ls that...
- No!


281
0:18:20,527 --> 0:18:24,847
No. This is just muddy water. See?


282
0:18:24,847 --> 0:18:42,647
- You just tasted muddy water.
- l know. That was weird.


283
0:18:42,647 --> 0:18:45,367
You're like, the best doctor ever.


284
0:18:45,367 --> 0:18:47,927
- Why didn't you ask me out?
- Are you kidding?


285
0:18:47,927 --> 0:18:51,967
l was laying there, pants-less,
with crusties in my nose, and l just...


286
0:18:51,967 --> 0:18:54,47
- Ask me out this minute.
- Yes, ma'am.


287
0:18:54,47 --> 0:18:58,327
Do you want to go out with me, Elliot?


288
0:18:58,327 --> 0:18:59,567
Yes.


289
0:18:59,567 --> 0:19:3,207
<i>When most of your time</i>

290
0:19:3,207 --> 0:19:7,767

<i>even a victory over your own self-doubt,</i>


291
0:19:7,767 --> 0:19:11,647
- How cool was that?
- OK, cool it.


292
0:19:11,647 --> 0:19:18,247
- l'll check you later.
- Check you later.


293
0:19:18,247 --> 0:19:20,207
l'm OK.


294
0:19:20,207 --> 0:19:21,767
Bye.


295
0:19:21,767 --> 0:19:26,287
You two are perfect for each other.


296
0:19:26,287 --> 0:19:31,847
l got a date. l got a date.


297
0:19:31,847 --> 0:19:42,487
<i>Sometimes your ego leads you</i>

<i>If you believe you're right</i>
<i>you have to fight for it,</i>


300
0:19:50,567 --> 0:19:54,887
l know it's the right way to go, and
l am not gonna take no for an answer.


301
0:19:54,887 --> 0:20:0,447
So what do you say?


302
0:20:0,447 --> 0:20:4,47
Let's do it.


303
0:20:4,47 --> 0:20:6,327
You won. Now beat it.


304
0:20:6,327 --> 0:20:10,7
- What?
- Go.


305
0:20:10,7 --> 0:20:12,487
Let's get you some sherbet.

0:20:18,887 --> 0:20:23,327
Newbie, if we lose to these cutters,
don't bother showing up tomorrow.


309
0:20:23,327 --> 0:20:37,527
l don't want to beat them.
l want to embarrass them.


310
0:20:37,527 --> 0:22:37,527
And go!
