2
0:0:14,27 --> 0:0:18,35
DAVID CHOE: Day 14 on
"Thumbs Up," our


3
0:0:18,35 --> 0:0:20,28
cross-country adventure.


4
0:0:20,28 --> 0:0:21,3
We're in the Big Easy.


5
0:0:21,3 --> 0:0:22,436
We're in New Orleans.


6
0:0:22,436 --> 0:0:24,33
Caught a ride late
last night out of


7
0:0:24,33 --> 0:0:26,79
Lake Providence, Louisiana.


8
0:0:26,79 --> 0:0:27,5
We want to just--


9
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:31,25
I guess it's exactly one
year after Katrina.


10
0:0:31,25 --> 0:0:33,23
I'm sure you see this shit on
the news all the time, but I


11
0:0:33,23 --> 0:0:36,43
want to see it for myself, so
we're going to walk over


12
0:0:36,43 --> 0:0:40,9
there, check it out, and try to
find a decent bowl of gumbo


13
0:0:40,9 --> 0:0:42,296
and then get the fuck
out of Dodge.


14
0:0:42,296 --> 0:0:47,62



15
0:0:47,62 --> 0:0:49,5
All right, we're here
with Thomas.


16
0:0:49,5 --> 0:0:50,47
THOMAS KING: King.


17
0:0:50,47 --> 0:0:51,12
DAVID CHOE: Thomas King?


18
0:0:51,12 --> 0:0:53,18
He's from, uh-- where
you from?


19
0:0:53,18 --> 0:0:53,652
THOMAS KING: New Orleans.


20
0:0:53,652 --> 0:0:54,596
I'm on Ninth Ward.


21
0:0:54,596 --> 0:0:56,484
DAVID CHOE: Let's see.


22
0:0:56,484 --> 0:1:0,34
Ninth Ward.


23
0:1:0,34 --> 0:1:1,6
We're--


24
0:1:1,6 --> 0:1:3,904
we're about to head over that
way just to check it out.


25
0:1:3,904 --> 0:1:5,92
You think two Asian guys will
be all right walking around


26
0:1:5,92 --> 0:1:7,38
the Ninth Ward?


27
0:1:7,38 --> 0:1:7,76
Yeah,


28
0:1:7,76 --> 0:1:8,14
THOMAS KING: Yeah, man.


29
0:1:8,14 --> 0:1:9,48
I mean, y'all would
be straight.


30
0:1:9,48 --> 0:1:11,43
All y'all gotta do is, you know
what I'm saying, keep


31
0:1:11,43 --> 0:1:13,63
your head up and look for, you
know, you gotta keep your eyes


32
0:1:13,63 --> 0:1:15,21
open, you know what I'm saying?
'Cause ain't no


33
0:1:15,21 --> 0:1:17,42
telling what might happen,
you know what I'm saying?


34
0:1:17,42 --> 0:1:18,945
Right now, like I said,
it's hot and


35
0:1:18,945 --> 0:1:20,7
everybody wants something.


36
0:1:20,7 --> 0:1:22,845
Everybody hungry, ain't got no
money, they hurting out here.


37
0:1:22,845 --> 0:1:25,64
And they'll jack you quick, so
you just got to be careful.


38
0:1:25,64 --> 0:1:27,11
You know, just watch yourself.


39
0:1:27,11 --> 0:1:27,815
DAVID CHOE: All right.


40
0:1:27,815 --> 0:1:29,933
Hey, thank you so much
for talking with us.


41
0:1:29,933 --> 0:1:31,412
THOMAS KING: Oh, for sure.


42
0:1:31,412 --> 0:1:32,398
Y'all be cool.


43
0:1:32,398 --> 0:1:32,891
DAVID CHOE: All right.


44
0:1:32,891 --> 0:1:34,141
Thanks.


45
0:1:34,141 --> 0:1:51,66



46
0:1:51,66 --> 0:1:55,2
So this is where the levee
broke, and then all these


47
0:1:55,2 --> 0:1:57,81
houses got blasted.


48
0:1:57,81 --> 0:1:59,6
But I guess they fixed it now.


49
0:1:59,6 --> 0:2:22,846



50
0:2:22,846 --> 0:2:26,552
Everyone wants to come out
to New Orleans to party.


51
0:2:26,552 --> 0:2:28,61
And it's just sad.


52
0:2:28,61 --> 0:2:32,315
Talked to a fellow today in the
restroom while I was in


53
0:2:32,315 --> 0:2:37,66
the bathroom, and he said the
heart and soul of the city's


54
0:2:37,66 --> 0:2:39,607
gone, and it'll never
come back.


55
0:2:39,607 --> 0:2:46,175
And now all the scavengers
and pirates and--


56
0:2:46,175 --> 0:2:49,14
it's the Wild West out here.


57
0:2:49,14 --> 0:2:50,41
I can't believe this
is America.


58
0:2:50,41 --> 0:3:5,61



59
0:3:5,61 --> 0:3:6,676
Hi, David.


60
0:3:6,676 --> 0:3:7,81
TIARA: Hi, Tiara.


61
0:3:7,81 --> 0:3:8,53
DAVID CHOE: Tiara?


62
0:3:8,53 --> 0:3:10,85
We're just traveling
cross-country, and we just got


63
0:3:10,85 --> 0:3:12,64
to New Orleans today.


64
0:3:12,64 --> 0:3:16,72
And I mean, I mean,
I'm pretty much--


65
0:3:16,72 --> 0:3:17,82
I don't know what to say.


66
0:3:17,82 --> 0:3:20,25
I can't believe it.


67
0:3:20,25 --> 0:3:22,57
But you're-- you're from
the Ninth Ward?


68
0:3:22,57 --> 0:3:25,39
TIARA: No, I'm really from the
Third Ward, but I stayed back


69
0:3:25,39 --> 0:3:27,21
[INAUDIBLE].


70
0:3:27,21 --> 0:3:30,155
I just really came back here
when my brother and my cousin


71
0:3:30,155 --> 0:3:32,77
got shot in Houston.


72
0:3:32,77 --> 0:3:34,2
DAVID CHOE: Your brother and
your cousin are from here?


73
0:3:34,2 --> 0:3:34,48
TIARA: Yeah.


74
0:3:34,48 --> 0:3:35,47
DAVID CHOE: They
went to Houston


75
0:3:35,47 --> 0:3:37,46
after Katrina and they--


76
0:3:37,46 --> 0:3:40,7
TIARA: Got into with them people
out there, and they


77
0:3:40,7 --> 0:3:40,71
killed them.


78
0:3:40,71 --> 0:3:41,2
DAVID CHOE: Who?


79
0:3:41,2 --> 0:3:43,55
TIARA: I don't know the boy's
name, but my brother's named


80
0:3:43,55 --> 0:3:46,71
Vincent Williams and my cousin
named Yolanda Stiles.


81
0:3:46,71 --> 0:3:47,87
DAVID CHOE: And they
both got shot?


82
0:3:47,87 --> 0:3:48,71
TIARA: Yeah.


83
0:3:48,71 --> 0:3:49,83
DAVID CHOE: And are--


84
0:3:49,83 --> 0:3:50,84
are they OK? or--


85
0:3:50,84 --> 0:3:51,86
TIARA: No, they passed.


86
0:3:51,86 --> 0:3:53,54
They passed away.


87
0:3:53,54 --> 0:3:56,51
DAVID CHOE: Oh my goodness.


88
0:3:56,51 --> 0:3:57,79
So what's the situation now?


89
0:3:57,79 --> 0:3:59,76
I mean, it looks
like there's--


90
0:3:59,76 --> 0:4:2,52
TIARA: It's really terrible
out here.


91
0:4:2,52 --> 0:4:3,48
It's terrible.


92
0:4:3,48 --> 0:4:4,65
DAVID CHOE: I mean, what--


93
0:4:4,65 --> 0:4:5,39
TIARA: It's bad.


94
0:4:5,39 --> 0:4:7,69
It's not really fit for
people to come back.


95
0:4:7,69 --> 0:4:9,54
DAVID CHOE: So, so
why did you?


96
0:4:9,54 --> 0:4:11,75
TIARA: 'Cause my mama wanted
to [INAUDIBLE]


97
0:4:11,75 --> 0:4:14,26
'cause where we stay
at, it's kind of


98
0:4:14,26 --> 0:4:15,95
straight, and then it ain't.


99
0:4:15,95 --> 0:4:18,91
DAVID CHOE: So roots is here,
you stay here, home is here.


100
0:4:18,91 --> 0:4:19,56
TIARA: Home is here.


101
0:4:19,56 --> 0:4:21,74
DAVID CHOE: Even if it's
bad like this?


102
0:4:21,74 --> 0:4:23,98
HARRY KIM: Who are
your neighbors?


103
0:4:23,98 --> 0:4:25,225
TIARA: I don't really
have neighbors.


104
0:4:25,225 --> 0:4:27,7
I don't really have neighbors.


105
0:4:27,7 --> 0:4:28,99
DAVID CHOE: So it's just you?


106
0:4:28,99 --> 0:4:30,858
Just walking around the
street by myself?


107
0:4:30,858 --> 0:4:32,754
TIARA: Yeah, fixin' to
go to the bus stop.


108
0:4:32,754 --> 0:4:35,598



109
0:4:35,598 --> 0:4:37,2
DAVID CHOE: We're up
in the Third Ward.


110
0:4:37,2 --> 0:4:38,93
We're gonna hang out
with these guys.


111
0:4:38,93 --> 0:4:39,68
So I'm Dave.


112
0:4:39,68 --> 0:4:40,65
BLING BLING: I'm Bling Bling.


113
0:4:40,65 --> 0:4:41,62
DAVID CHOE: Bling Bling?


114
0:4:41,62 --> 0:4:42,91
This is Harry.


115
0:4:42,91 --> 0:4:44,751
BLING BLING: Bling Bling.


116
0:4:44,751 --> 0:4:46,22
DAVID CHOE: Tell us where
we're at right now.


117
0:4:46,22 --> 0:4:48,5
BLING BLING: Oh.


118
0:4:48,5 --> 0:4:50,34
MALE SPEAKER: You on Josephine,
heard me?


119
0:4:50,34 --> 0:4:52,76
Uptown Josephine Third
Ward, you heard, we


120
0:4:52,76 --> 0:4:54,6
doing it big out here.


121
0:4:54,6 --> 0:4:57,3
We got a little grill going,
little [INAUDIBLE] on, little


122
0:4:57,3 --> 0:4:58,73
food, you heard me?


123
0:4:58,73 --> 0:5:1,553
This my dog Eddie right
here, heard me?


124
0:5:1,553 --> 0:5:3,317
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


125
0:5:3,317 --> 0:5:4,62
DAVID CHOE: Is that
the General?


126
0:5:4,62 --> 0:5:5,62
The Third Ward General?


127
0:5:5,62 --> 0:5:5,88
BLING BLING: Yeah.


128
0:5:5,88 --> 0:5:6,37
Oh oh.


129
0:5:6,37 --> 0:5:9,12
DAVID CHOE: The General is
cooking all kinds of goodness.


130
0:5:9,12 --> 0:5:11,2
The General definitely takes
care of his army.


131
0:5:11,2 --> 0:5:13,9
They're fed well.


132
0:5:13,9 --> 0:5:14,92
People are smiling.


133
0:5:14,92 --> 0:5:15,23
Where are we?


134
0:5:15,23 --> 0:5:16,52
This is the world?


135
0:5:16,52 --> 0:5:18,0
THE GENERAL: Pretty much.


136
0:5:18,0 --> 0:5:19,84
Out of all 50 states.


137
0:5:19,84 --> 0:5:20,69
This state.


138
0:5:20,69 --> 0:5:23,97
DAVID CHOE: Out of all 50
states, Louisiana, this is the


139
0:5:23,97 --> 0:5:24,8
center of the world?


140
0:5:24,8 --> 0:5:25,772
THE GENERAL: The center.


141
0:5:25,772 --> 0:5:27,23
DAVID CHOE: This is the world.


142
0:5:27,23 --> 0:5:28,87
THE GENERAL: This
is the epitome.


143
0:5:28,87 --> 0:5:29,688
DAVID CHOE: I'll tell you
what, you're the most


144
0:5:29,688 --> 0:5:31,8
hospitable, that's for sure.


145
0:5:31,8 --> 0:5:33,39
THE GENERAL: I was born and
raised in Metairie, Louisiana.


146
0:5:33,39 --> 0:5:35,31
I went to school with whites.


147
0:5:35,31 --> 0:5:39,14
Asian, Indian.


148
0:5:39,14 --> 0:5:41,57
Matters not the different.


149
0:5:41,57 --> 0:5:47,15
The only thing my mother told
me about any individual is


150
0:5:47,15 --> 0:5:48,74
when that person hits you?


151
0:5:48,74 --> 0:5:50,71
You hit that person back.


152
0:5:50,71 --> 0:5:52,97
She never taught
me about color.


153
0:5:52,97 --> 0:5:54,92
Because they were
all my friends.


154
0:5:54,92 --> 0:5:55,42
Yeah.


155
0:5:55,42 --> 0:5:57,37
DAVID CHOE: What you got
in there, sausage?


156
0:5:57,37 --> 0:5:58,34
THE GENERAL: Turkey
necks and sausage.


157
0:5:58,34 --> 0:5:58,77
DAVID CHOE: Turkey necks.


158
0:5:58,77 --> 0:5:59,64
THE GENERAL: A little celery.


159
0:5:59,64 --> 0:6:1,4
DAVID CHOE: Turkey necks.


160
0:6:1,4 --> 0:6:2,29
That's delicious.


161
0:6:2,29 --> 0:6:8,24



162
0:6:8,24 --> 0:6:11,21
Josephine, Third Ward clique.


163
0:6:11,21 --> 0:6:12,62
That's where we're at.


164
0:6:12,62 --> 0:6:13,7
HARRY KIM: New Orleans.


165
0:6:13,7 --> 0:6:13,725
DAVID CHOE: See you
guys later.


166
0:6:13,725 --> 0:6:15,48
Josephine Third Ward clique.


167
0:6:15,48 --> 0:6:16,3
MALE SPEAKER: Uptown.


168
0:6:16,3 --> 0:6:18,56
HARRY KIM: Uptown.


169
0:6:18,56 --> 0:6:20,96
MALE SPEAKER: Uptown
Josephine.


170
0:6:20,96 --> 0:6:22,41
DAVID CHOE: Uptown Josephine.


171
0:6:22,41 --> 0:6:23,4
HARRY KIM: Uptown.


172
0:6:23,4 --> 0:6:23,76
DAVID CHOE: Third Ward.


173
0:6:23,76 --> 0:6:24,99
HARRY KIM: Third Ward.


174
0:6:24,99 --> 0:6:27,1
DAVID CHOE: Third Ward clique.


175
0:6:27,1 --> 0:6:28,9
Third Ward.


176
0:6:28,9 --> 0:6:29,56
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].


177
0:6:29,56 --> 0:6:30,505
Y'all be cool.


178
0:6:30,505 --> 0:6:32,92
[INAUDIBLE].


179
0:6:32,92 --> 0:6:34,6
DAVID CHOE: Third Ward.


180
0:6:34,6 --> 0:6:35,965
MALE SPEAKER: Byyyye!


181
0:6:35,965 --> 0:6:37,33
HARRY KIM: Bye!


182
0:6:37,33 --> 0:6:39,2
DAVID CHOE: By far the most
at home I've felt


183
0:6:39,2 --> 0:6:40,39
on this entire trip.


184
0:6:40,39 --> 0:6:43,73
By far the best food I've
had on this entire trip.


185
0:6:43,73 --> 0:6:44,675
Unbelievable.


186
0:6:44,675 --> 0:6:46,0
I'll always remember.


187
0:6:46,0 --> 0:6:47,84
We'll always have a home here.


188
0:6:47,84 --> 0:6:49,34
Take it all the way Miami.


189
0:6:49,34 --> 0:6:51,7
Be there hopefully
by tomorrow.


190
0:6:51,7 --> 0:6:55,0
As the sun sets over the
Big Easy, we head home.


191
0:6:55,0 --> 0:6:59,23
And hopefully get to the
Atlantic Ocean by tomorrow.


192
0:6:59,23 --> 0:7:7,0



193
0:7:7,0 --> 0:7:9,882
Pretty much had the most
amazing experience


194
0:7:9,882 --> 0:7:12,76
of the trip so far.


195
0:7:12,76 --> 0:7:16,58
I can't believe how nice these
people were and how delicious


196
0:7:16,58 --> 0:7:17,83
the food was.


197
0:7:17,83 --> 0:7:18,715
The sauce--


198
0:7:18,715 --> 0:7:19,71
I don't know what
was in there.


199
0:7:19,71 --> 0:7:21,25
Spicy as fuck.


200
0:7:21,25 --> 0:7:22,66
Got all the sinuses going.


201
0:7:22,66 --> 0:7:23,43
Delicious.


202
0:7:23,43 --> 0:7:27,49
But as the sun sets over New
Orleans, we head, hopefully,


203
0:7:27,49 --> 0:7:31,87
on our last leg of the race
towards the east, and


204
0:7:31,87 --> 0:7:36,55
hopefully soon, these mosquito
bite-ridden, diseased,


205
0:7:36,55 --> 0:7:39,394
sunburned toes will get to
touch the Atlantic Ocean.


206
0:7:39,394 --> 0:7:50,756



207
0:7:50,756 --> 0:7:56,684
HARRY KIM: [LAUGHS]


208
0:7:56,684 --> 0:8:7,11



209
0:8:7,11 --> 0:8:8,555
DAVID CHOE: Is it cool

0:10:35,241 --> 0:10:46,14

DAVID CHOE: So here we are
in Theodore, Alabama.


301
0:10:50,13 --> 0:10:54,39
And I was in the Pilot getting a
drink and taking a piss, and


302
0:10:54,39 --> 0:10:56,79
I noticed this guy Jerry
moping around.


303
0:10:56,79 --> 0:11:0,73
And I noticed the jail tattoo,
got a cross right here.


304
0:11:0,73 --> 0:11:3,38
And the skulls--


305
0:11:3,38 --> 0:11:5,12
the skulls, that's that?


306
0:11:5,12 --> 0:11:6,37
Treasure chest.


307
0:11:6,37 --> 0:11:8,24



308
0:11:8,24 --> 0:11:10,67
Seahorse, that's hard-core.


309
0:11:10,67 --> 0:11:12,62
Jerry just told me something
very strange.


310
0:11:12,62 --> 0:11:14,4
He said he's locked up.


311
0:11:14,4 --> 0:11:15,87
He's in jail.


312
0:11:15,87 --> 0:11:16,41
JERRY: In prison.


313
0:11:16,41 --> 0:11:19,15

not locked up 'cause he's here


314
0:11:19,15 --> 0:11:21,68
talking to me, so what's--


315
0:11:21,68 --> 0:11:24,55

release program in the

0:11:24,55 --> 0:11:26,42

0:11:26,42 --> 0:11:29,31
There's one in Mobile.

321
0:11:34,886 --> 0:11:36,293
When we get paid, they
get all our money.

0:11:36,293 --> 0:11:37,7
It really sucks.


323
0:11:37,7 --> 0:11:38,87

gotta go back to jail.


324
0:11:38,87 --> 0:11:40,87
JERRY: Yeah, I gotta
go back tonight.


325
0:11:40,87 --> 0:11:42,87

Is it horrible?


335
0:11:56,64 --> 0:11:59,79
JERRY: Well, until you
get to where I'm at,


336
0:11:59,79 --> 0:12:0,6
it's kind of horrible.


337
0:12:0,6 --> 0:12:2,27

358
0:12:30,35 --> 0:12:31,78

0:13:35,822 --> 0:13:51,81



407
0:13:51,81 --> 0:13:54,41
Today's is day 15
on our journey.


408
0:13:54,41 --> 0:13:56,515
We're somewhere in the
panhandle of Florida.


409
0:13:56,515 --> 0:13:59,8
We're trying to get to Miami,
and look at what we found.


410
0:13:59,8 --> 0:14:1,47
Fellow drifter, fellow
train-hopper.


411
0:14:1,47 --> 0:14:1,875
FREDDY: Right.


412
0:14:1,875 --> 0:14:3,72
DAVID CHOE: Used to jump
the train all the time?


413
0:14:3,72 --> 0:14:4,765
FREDDY: All the time.


414
0:14:4,765 --> 0:14:7,304
DAVID CHOE: So during all your
years of train-hopping, what's


415
0:14:7,304 --> 0:14:9,432
the craziest thing
you ever seen.


416
0:14:9,432 --> 0:14:10,8
FREDDY: I seen [INAUDIBLE]


417
0:14:10,8 --> 0:14:12,455
I seen sexual acts
on the train.


418
0:14:12,455 --> 0:14:13,84
I seen-- oh, man.


419
0:14:13,84 --> 0:14:15,41
DAVID CHOE: What--what did
you see on the train?


420
0:14:15,41 --> 0:14:15,57
You saw--


421
0:14:15,57 --> 0:14:17,87
FREDDY: Oh, I seen a lady
give a man a blow job


422
0:14:17,87 --> 0:14:18,73
DAVID CHOE: On a--


423
0:14:18,73 --> 0:14:21,3
FREDDY: On the train,
the train ran along.


424
0:14:21,3 --> 0:14:22,25
I seen 'em cooking
on the train.


425
0:14:22,25 --> 0:14:25,97
They have their pots and
stuff for cooking.


426
0:14:25,97 --> 0:14:26,32
DAVID CHOE: Wow.


427
0:14:26,32 --> 0:14:28,52
FREDDY: You sees a lot of
wild stuff on a train.


428
0:14:28,52 --> 0:14:30,32
DAVID CHOE: But you haven't
done it in a while?


429
0:14:30,32 --> 0:14:30,73
FREDDY: No.


430
0:14:30,73 --> 0:14:31,67
I ain't in shape--


431
0:14:31,67 --> 0:14:33,69
I'm a old man now.


432
0:14:33,69 --> 0:14:35,58
I ain't quite the shape
I used to be.


433
0:14:35,58 --> 0:14:37,96
DAVID CHOE: How was that
blow job, though?


434
0:14:37,96 --> 0:14:41,465
FREDDY: It wasn't on me,
but I'll say, I'll say


435
0:14:41,465 --> 0:14:43,357
it aroused me, huh?


436
0:14:43,357 --> 0:14:45,722
I was sitting there listening,
I'm listening,


437
0:14:45,722 --> 0:14:46,668
you know what I mean?


438
0:14:46,668 --> 0:14:47,62
It ain't embarrassing.


439
0:14:47,62 --> 0:14:49,2
I'm sitting their listening--


440
0:14:49,2 --> 0:14:49,54
DAVID CHOE: Hey, man.


441
0:14:49,54 --> 0:14:51,89
If you're hopping trains and
there's people getting blow


442
0:14:51,89 --> 0:14:54,13
jobs, wouldn't you want to hop
the trains all the time?


443
0:14:54,13 --> 0:14:54,42
FREDDY: No.


444
0:14:54,42 --> 0:14:55,73
Not really.


445
0:14:55,73 --> 0:14:57,73
DAVID CHOE: Hey, what
do you do--


446
0:14:57,73 --> 0:14:58,27
last question.


447
0:14:58,27 --> 0:15:1,65
What do you do when you're, you
know, you're on the train


448
0:15:1,65 --> 0:15:4,12
and you gotta do number two?


449
0:15:4,12 --> 0:15:6,39
FREDDY: Boo-boo there and
throw it out the door.


450
0:15:6,39 --> 0:15:9,32
DAVID CHOE: You boo-boo there,
and you throw it out the door.


451
0:15:9,32 --> 0:15:9,71
Throw it out the door.


452
0:15:9,71 --> 0:15:10,61
Thanks, Freddy.


453
0:15:10,61 --> 0:15:11,85
FREDDY: Yeah, man.


454
0:15:11,85 --> 0:15:12,97
DAVID CHOE: Wish us luck.


455
0:15:12,97 --> 0:15:14,22
FREDDY: I wish y'all
luck, man.


456
0:15:14,22 --> 0:15:44,19



457
0:15:44,19 --> 0:15:46,514
DAVID CHOE: Whew!


458
0:15:46,514 --> 0:15:47,764
All right, Florida.


459
0:15:47,764 --> 0:15:51,539



460
0:15:51,539 --> 0:15:53,41
It's a lonely road.


461
0:15:53,41 --> 0:15:56,163
So we just got a ride in, uh--


462
0:15:56,163 --> 0:15:57,62
I have no idea where we are.


463
0:15:57,62 --> 0:16:0,24
Somewhere in the panhandle
of Florida.


464
0:16:0,24 --> 0:16:4,15
And the trains are very
sporadic, so we might just


465
0:16:4,15 --> 0:16:6,19
hitchhike to Miami.


466
0:16:6,19 --> 0:16:8,0
If we could catch a train,
that'd be great, but if not


467
0:16:8,0 --> 0:16:11,13
we'll just thumb it out.


468
0:16:11,13 --> 0:16:13,118
Thumbs up, America.


469
0:16:13,118 --> 0:16:14,6
Fucking love you.


470
0:16:14,6 --> 0:16:43,26



471
0:16:43,26 --> 0:16:43,49
MIKE: Hey.


472
0:16:43,49 --> 0:16:44,18
DAVID CHOE: What's your name?


473
0:16:44,18 --> 0:16:44,67
MIKE: Mike.


474
0:16:44,67 --> 0:16:45,41
DAVID CHOE: Mike, I'm David.


475
0:16:45,41 --> 0:16:46,4
This is Harry.


476
0:16:46,4 --> 0:16:47,28
We're just going
cross-country.


477
0:16:47,28 --> 0:16:48,78
This is our 15th day.


478
0:16:48,78 --> 0:16:49,845
We came all the way from LA.


479
0:16:49,845 --> 0:16:52,545
We're hopefully going to
hit Miami tonight.


480
0:16:52,545 --> 0:16:53,72
We're tired, dirty.


481
0:16:53,72 --> 0:16:55,33
MIKE: 15 days, you just
come from LA?


482
0:16:55,33 --> 0:16:57,3
DAVID CHOE: Yeah, hitchhiking,
hopping the trains.


483
0:16:57,3 --> 0:16:58,59
So we're tired, dirty.


484
0:16:58,59 --> 0:17:0,32
You know.


485
0:17:0,32 --> 0:17:3,55
MIKE: You look like you can
use a couple shirts.


486
0:17:3,55 --> 0:17:4,3
DAVID CHOE: I mean, I don't--


487
0:17:4,3 --> 0:17:5,43
if you got it, that
would be great.


488
0:17:5,43 --> 0:17:8,67
We smell really bad, but I don't
want to trouble you.


489
0:17:8,67 --> 0:17:9,128
MIKE: Yeah, man.


490
0:17:9,128 --> 0:17:9,96
Here, let me give
you something.


491
0:17:9,96 --> 0:17:10,599
DAVID CHOE: Are you serious?


492
0:17:10,599 --> 0:17:12,19
MIKE: Yeah, hang on.


493
0:17:12,19 --> 0:17:12,955
Here, he's one.


494
0:17:12,955 --> 0:17:14,39
You like pink?


495
0:17:14,39 --> 0:17:15,552
DAVID CHOE: Hey, we'll
take whatever.


496
0:17:15,552 --> 0:17:17,25
MIKE: There you go,
there's one there.


497
0:17:17,25 --> 0:17:18,35
DAVID CHOE: Oh, thanks, Mike.


498
0:17:18,35 --> 0:17:19,11
HARRY KIM: Thanks a lot, Mike.


499
0:17:19,11 --> 0:17:19,49
DAVID CHOE: Take care.


500
0:17:19,49 --> 0:17:21,416
Thanks for the ride.


501
0:17:21,416 --> 0:17:22,874
Wow.


502
0:17:22,874 --> 0:17:24,818
You want pink or orange?


503
0:17:24,818 --> 0:17:26,276
HARRY KIM: I'll wear
the pink one.


504
0:17:26,276 --> 0:17:27,26
DAVID CHOE: All right.


505
0:17:27,26 --> 0:17:28,51
Thank you.


506
0:17:28,51 --> 0:17:32,17



507
0:17:32,17 --> 0:17:34,265
I guess one size definitely
fits all.


508
0:17:34,265 --> 0:17:38,22



509
0:17:38,22 --> 0:17:40,11
Best shirts ever.


510
0:17:40,11 --> 0:17:40,78
Wow.


511
0:17:40,78 --> 0:17:42,9
HARRY KIM: I guess we'll
sleep warm tonight.


512
0:17:42,9 --> 0:17:44,77



513
0:17:44,77 --> 0:17:47,56
DAVID CHOE: Oh my god.


514
0:17:47,56 --> 0:17:48,86
Oh my goodness gracious.


515
0:17:48,86 --> 0:17:59,2



516
0:17:59,2 --> 0:18:2,11
We're definitely, definitely
going to get rides in these.


517
0:18:2,11 --> 0:18:2,31
HARRY KIM: Huaahhh.


518
0:18:2,31 --> 0:18:3,9
DAVID CHOE: I don't know if
they'll be the rides that we


519
0:18:3,9 --> 0:18:6,17
want, but we'll definitely
get rides in these.


520
0:18:6,17 --> 0:18:6,655
HARRY KIM: Yeah.


521
0:18:6,655 --> 0:18:8,11
DAVID CHOE: Thumbs
up, America.


522
0:18:8,11 --> 0:18:12,292
We love cats and flowers
and butterflies.


523
0:18:12,292 --> 0:18:13,542
HARRY KIM: [MEOW]


524
0:18:13,542 --> 0:18:24,492



525
0:18:24,492 --> 0:18:26,92
DAVID CHOE: So we just got
dropped off by Mike, and then


526
0:18:26,92 --> 0:18:28,824
this bus pulled up
right behind us


527
0:18:28,824 --> 0:18:30,908
with a bunch of workers.


528
0:18:30,908 --> 0:18:33,66
I don't know where they're going
to work, but they just


529
0:18:33,66 --> 0:18:35,652
stopped and a bunch of them got
off to use the restroom.


530
0:18:35,652 --> 0:18:38,9
And Jacinto, our cameraman
that is very fluent in


531
0:18:38,9 --> 0:18:40,642
Spanish, asked them
if we could have a


532
0:18:40,642 --> 0:18:41,54
ride and he said yes.


533
0:18:41,54 --> 0:18:43,104
And now we're on the bus.


534
0:18:43,104 --> 0:18:47,4



535
0:18:47,4 --> 0:18:48,29
Hola.


536
0:18:48,29 --> 0:19:1,31



537
0:19:1,31 --> 0:19:4,95
I'm not sure exactly what
happened, but somewhere in the


538
0:19:4,95 --> 0:19:9,15
panhandle of Florida, we got
on a bus and I think we're


539
0:19:9,15 --> 0:19:10,75
somewhere near Miami.


540
0:19:10,75 --> 0:19:14,1
We got on a bus that was
predominantly farm workers.


541
0:19:14,1 --> 0:19:15,65
They're tomato farmers.


542
0:19:15,65 --> 0:19:18,71
And the boss said if we worked
for free he might give us a


543
0:19:18,71 --> 0:19:20,19
ride closer in to town.


544
0:19:20,19 --> 0:19:23,784
So off to make salsa.


545
0:19:23,784 --> 0:19:25,26
Thumbs up, America.


546
0:19:25,26 --> 0:19:38,3



547
0:19:38,3 --> 0:19:38,93
We made it.


548
0:19:38,93 --> 0:19:39,77
We're in Miami.


549
0:19:39,77 --> 0:19:43,54
We went from the Pacific
to the Atlantic.


550
0:19:43,54 --> 0:20:20,62



551
0:20:20,62 --> 0:20:22,881
Well, America, we did it.


552
0:20:22,881 --> 0:20:26,96
Here we are in the beautiful
Atlantic Ocean on Day 16 as


553
0:20:26,96 --> 0:20:30,12
the sun comes up.


554
0:20:30,12 --> 0:20:35,24
But I gotta tell you, boy, do I
got a lot of words for you.


555
0:20:35,24 --> 0:20:38,7
I mean, I have a lot of--


556
0:20:38,7 --> 0:20:40,89
I got a lot of mixed
emotions right now.


557
0:20:40,89 --> 0:20:45,86
America, you're like the bossy
know-it-all, you're like the


558
0:20:45,86 --> 0:20:47,59
kid I want to beat up.


559
0:20:47,59 --> 0:20:49,45
You're like--


560
0:20:49,45 --> 0:20:50,95
I want to like--


561
0:20:50,95 --> 0:20:53,91
you're like the half-sister that
I want to fuck, or the


562
0:20:53,91 --> 0:20:55,97
actual sister that
I want to fuck.


563
0:20:55,97 --> 0:20:58,95
You're like, you're like my
ex-girlfriend that I want to


564
0:20:58,95 --> 0:21:1,1
duct-tape and shit
on her chest.


565
0:21:1,1 --> 0:21:4,51
But like I fucking love you and
I hate you and I want to


566
0:21:4,51 --> 0:21:7,25
like slap you and I want to
dry-ass-rape you, but then I


567
0:21:7,25 --> 0:21:10,495
want to like pet you and cuddle
with you and like dry


568
0:21:10,495 --> 0:21:13,47
hump you and like cuddle with
you and spoon you and hold


569
0:21:13,47 --> 0:21:15,89
hands with you.


570
0:21:15,89 --> 0:21:18,1
I love you and I hate you and
I have very mixed feelings


571
0:21:18,1 --> 0:21:19,73
toward you, but I feel like
I'm gonna cry right now


572
0:21:19,73 --> 0:21:23,23
because it has been one of
the most amazing American


573
0:21:23,23 --> 0:21:24,48
adventures ever.


574
0:21:24,48 --> 0:21:27,18
Every day I woke up, I had no
idea what was going to happen,


575
0:21:27,18 --> 0:21:28,7
and it was just--


576
0:21:28,7 --> 0:21:32,41
the people are so crazy and
so diverse and so--


577
0:21:32,41 --> 0:21:35,22
the good, the bad and the
ugly, it's all American.


578
0:21:35,22 --> 0:21:38,39
And I'm really sad 'cause I'm
gonna be home soon, and it's


579
0:21:38,39 --> 0:21:40,97
gonna be, like--


580
0:21:40,97 --> 0:21:45,74
16 days to trek across this
country, through land, ocean,


581
0:21:45,74 --> 0:21:49,19
lakes, rivers, cars, trains,
automobiles.


582
0:21:49,19 --> 0:21:51,55
And then we're just going to
fly back in five hours, and


583
0:21:51,55 --> 0:21:53,16
tomorrow morning I'm
gonna wake up.


584
0:21:53,16 --> 0:21:54,89
I know exactly what I'm gonna
eat for breakfast.


585
0:21:54,89 --> 0:21:57,242
And it's just going to be like
hitting a brick wall.


586
0:21:57,242 --> 0:22:2,39
But America, Dave and Harry
are on the road.


587
0:22:2,39 --> 0:22:3,945
We're here, we're there,
we're everywhere.


588
0:22:3,945 --> 0:22:6,31
Who knows where you'll
see us next.


589
0:22:6,31 --> 0:22:7,33
HARRY KIM: The romance
is back, America.


590
0:22:7,33 --> 0:22:8,33
DAVID CHOE: We love you.


591
0:22:8,33 --> 0:22:8,78
HARRY KIM: We love you.


592
0:22:8,78 --> 0:22:10,79
DAVID CHOE: No matter how many
harsh things you said to us


593
0:22:10,79 --> 0:22:13,46
and no matter how many bad
things we've said to you, in


594
0:22:13,46 --> 0:22:14,775
the end, we forgive.


595
0:22:14,775 --> 0:22:15,49
HARRY KIM: We love.


596
0:22:15,49 --> 0:22:15,97
DAVID CHOE: We--


597
0:22:15,97 --> 0:22:16,67
we love.


598
0:22:16,67 --> 0:22:17,73
We're full of so much love.


599
0:22:17,73 --> 0:22:18,54
We forgive.


600
0:22:18,54 --> 0:22:19,75
We forget.


601
0:22:19,75 --> 0:22:22,14
And it's-- tomorrow we go to
sleep and we wake up and it's


602
0:22:22,14 --> 0:22:23,904
just a whole new day.


603
0:22:23,904 --> 0:22:26,24
And--


604
0:22:26,24 --> 0:22:27,12
HARRY KIM: Au revoir.


605
0:22:27,12 --> 0:22:28,18
DAVID CHOE: Thumbs
up, America.


606
0:22:28,18 --> 0:22:29,43
We love you.


607
0:22:29,43 --> 0:24:29,43
