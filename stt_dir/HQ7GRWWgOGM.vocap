###13 DAVID CHOE: Three.
###14 Season three, "Thumbs Up." What's up, everyone?
###17 My name is David Choe.
###18 I'm here with the son of my uncle's cousin, Harry Kim, AKA
###21 Guam Cruise, AKA Horny Kim, AKA Harry Kim.
###25 Gettin' down.
###26 Got ribs.
###28 Anyways, "Thumbs Up." This is a show about hitchhiking,
###33 riding trains, riding airplanes, riding boats.
###36 Any means necessary to get across whatever
###38 country that might be.
###40 Today that country happens to be China.
###42 That's where we are right now.
###43 In BJ, Beijing.
###44 A city known for Peking Duck and hand release.
###46 And it's the art capital of the world right now.
###50 We're going to hitchhike across this country.
###51 We're going to go someplace, maybe warm, someplace
###54 hopefully where there's gambling and some
###57 nice looking ladies.
###58 
###62 We're going to start that adventure today.
###64 But before we start--
###65 you know, in a perfect world, I would make a living from
###68 hitchhiking.
###68 Unfortunately, I make my living from drawing pictures,
###71 and painting stuff, and pushing pigment around.
###74 And that's what brought me here.
###75 I have my first art show in China.
###77 So come on America, come on China.
###79 Come see what I do for a living.
###80 Why don't you get to know me a little bit?
###82 Let's check out some art.
###84 "Thumbs Up" season three.
###85 
###89 Hey.
###90 Let's go to look my room.
###91 
###95 Oh.
###96 Look who we have here.
###97 
###103 So, this is basically where I've been living for
###108 the last two weeks.
###109 Three weeks, now.
###110 And this is where I stay, where I put my whole show of
###114 art together for China.
###116 I never been here before.
###117 And the skies were grey, there's soldiers, there's
###120 dirty ass street markets.
###121 And all this stuff was amazing for inspiration for all the
###124 paintings and stuff, but it's bleak.
###126 There's nothing out where I am.
###128 And I was painting like I was a monk.
###130 And I got really fuckin' horny.
###134 I wanted to fuck so bad.
###136 But I don't speak the language.
###137 I don't speak one word of Chinese.
###140 From here, we went to the mall.
###141 It was the first time I had been around
###143 women in three weeks.
###144 So I was looking pretty much how I look now, sleazy as
###148 fuck, holding a bucket of KFC, eating the chicken, going down
###152 the elevator, trying to look up skirts.
###154 Trying to hit on girls.
###155 Ni hao.
###156 Not having very good luck with it.
###160 I just got a raging boner at the Chinese mall.
###162 
###165 I couldn't [INAUDIBLE]
###166 to any of these girls.
###167 So I came back to this room right here.
###172 Harry was pretending to be sleeping.
###174 And I fucking jacked off day and night for 36 hours.
###180 And in this angle right here, after my my penis was stuck to
###186 my leg like this and I couldn't fucking
###188 touch myself anymore.
###189 I looked up his metal ceiling beams right here.
###194 And there's like a metal rust pattern on there.
###196 And in my zapped out state, that pattern of the old man
###201 popped out at me.
###203 So I grabbed my sketchbook and I started drawing this old man
###206 staring at me.
###207 This sort of became a catalyst for the new shit that I did
###210 out here, which was this old pervert, hanging out at the
###214 mall, staring at chicks.
###216 Everyone always asks me what my art's about.
###218 And it's about the gigantic pervert that lives inside me.
###223 Scumbag.
###224 We're all scumbags.
###225 
###233 So this is the old man.
###234 This is the oil painting I did from that little sketch from
###237 the old man on the ceiling.
###238 And I did a ton of these outside.
###242 FEMALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###250 DAVID CHOE: I tried to talk to many girls today so far, and
###253 none of them speak English.
###255 Mia seems to speak perfect English, so we're going to
###257 talk to her a little bit.
###258 MIA: And I'm such a fan.
###260 DAVID CHOE: You're a fan?
###261 MIA: Yes I am.
###261 DAVID CHOE: Oh, cool.
###262 Me and Harry are going to leave tomorrow on a
###265 hitchhiking trip.
###266 you Do you think anyone's going to pick us up?
###267 Do you think it's a good idea, a bad idea?
###269 MIA: I just think it's going to be tough, because
###272 hitchhiking is not really part of Chinese culture.
###276 Are you just going to do this?
###277 Or are you going to have a little board?
###279 DAVID CHOE: If we make a sign, what should the sign say?
###281 MIA: Say, pick me up, I'm an artist.
###284 DAVID CHOE: Pick me up, I'm an artist?
###287 Other signs we've had in America, we just write, we
###290 have vaginas.
###292 And we toss salads.
###293 And that's the signs we have.
###296 MIA: Wow.
###297 Good luck.
###297 DAVID CHOE: Good luck, OK.
###299 
###304 So, Harry's sister lives in China.
###306 And I told him, no hoes on the road.
###309 We got to keep it bros only.
###310 And this fucking guy.
###312 And his sister's the most fucking annoying--
###315 why did you do that?
###316 HARRY KIM: I don't know.
###317 We're in the same city, dude.
###318 I don't know.
###319 DAVID CHOE: Shh.
###319 Here she comes.
###320 Hi, Stephanie.
###321 STEPHANIE: Hey!
###321 HARRY KIM: Hi, Stephanie!
###322 Hey!
###323 
###326 DAVID CHOE: Hi, hi.
###327 
###330 So.
###331 How's China?
###331 STEPHANIE: It's good.
###333 What the fuck?
###334 You guys going to try and go on a roadtrip without me?
###338 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###339 You really want to come?
###340 STEPHANIE: Yeah, please.
###343 DAVID CHOE: All right, so I have had fun talking to people
###346 in Chinese that don't speak Chinese.
###348 But Stephanie speaks a little Chinese, so she can help us.
###352 This might fuck up the combo we have.
###355 The equation.
###356 
###362 All right.
###362 Let's do it.
###363 
###369 What else do we need here?
###371 HARRY KIM: Just a suit.
###372 DAVID CHOE: I gotta look sharp.
###373 I'm going hitchhiking.
###374 I gotta look slick.
###375 
###379 How's that look?
###381 HARRY KIM: It's sharp.
###382 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###385 We've got cabbage.
###387 We got mad cabbage.
###388 All we need is a ride.
###389 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###397 DAVID CHOE: Thumbs up!
###398 HARRY KIM: Thumbs up.
###399 
###406 DAVID CHOE: Me, Stephanie, and Harry, we just got a ride from
###408 the darkest Chinese man I've ever seen in my life, with the
###411 most beautiful smile.
###413 He just dropped us off in this bombed-out building.
###416 The gallery kicked me out.
###417 I'm in Beijing still.
###418 I think this is a good place to set up camp for tonight and
###421 the get ready to head out.
###423 I wasn't ready for our new addition, but let's see
###426 how it works out.
###427 Let's check out the spot.
###428 
###431 HARRY KIM: This looks nice.
###435 DAVID CHOE: Goodnight, America.
###436 Thumbs up.
###437 Thumbs up, China.
###439 I love you, even though you don't speak English.
###440 Engrish.
###441 See you tomorrow.
###443 
###448 "Thumbs Up," China.
###450 It's our second day on the road, our third day filming.
###454 So I guess, officially, "Thumbs Up" China, season
###458 three, day three.
###461 Horrible sleep last night.
###462 The smell of petrified shit filling our nose.
###465 We ended up waking up super early.
###468 Beijing's cool, but I'm ready to see the rest of China.
###472 I guess in China you can walk right on to the freeway.
###474 
###481 We're trying to get a ride.
###483 I'm pretty tired.
###486 Let's see if she can get something going.
###488 
###492 I've never traveled with a female companion.
###496 Harry's always been enough woman for me to get a ride.
###501 Stephanie's working her magic.
###503 We'll see if her female charms work against the gruff Chinese
###507 truck drivers.
###508 In America, the truck drivers almost never pick up because
###511 of insurance reasons.
###512 I don't know if it's the same out here.
###514 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###524 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###525 There's one more truck right there.
###528 
###532 Stephanie's first try, fail.
###535 But don't be mad.
###536 There's another truck.
###537 Let's give it another shot.
###538 There's another truck, too.
###542 I think our chances are going to be good here.
###543 They said nobody picks up hitchhikers, but we'll see
###546 what happens.
###547 
###550 Tell him he's very handsome and I want to interview him
###551 while he's driving.
###552 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###558 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###561 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###562 DAVID CHOE: Yeah?
###563 All right!
###564 Yes.
###567 A lovely couple, empty bus, our first ride.
###570 Thumbs up, China.
###571 
###581 Hey, tell them I'm going to sing a song for them.
###582 
###586 STEPHANIE: She can understand you.
###587 [INAUDIBLE]
###588 DAVID CHOE: Oh, you understand?
###589 STEPHANIE: [INAUDIBLE]
###591 DAVID CHOE: What?
###593 
###595 It doesn't get [INAUDIBLE]
###596 than this.
###596 America, look.
###598 We just got our first ride.
###601 Look, a completely empty bus.
###603 There's no one in here.
###604 And we got fruits, snacks, and a gold mic.
###609 Stephanie, you want to take a song?
###613 Stephanie failed on her first try.
###615 Her second try popped her cherry.
###617 You got a ride.
###619 Man, fuck everyone that said we're not going to get picked
###622 up in China.
###623 High five, everyone.
###624 Come on.
###625 High five, high five, high five.
###627 High five, come on.
###628 
###632 Is she mad that her husband picked us up?
###635 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###636 DAVID CHOE: She's pretty pissed.
###637 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###638 DAVID CHOE: Oh, no, no, no, she's not pissed.
###640 
###643 I would very much like to find a Chinese wife for
###646 myself or for Harry.
###648 But all the Chinese go so far say they don't like us because
###651 we play around too much.
###653 A Chinese girl?
###655 STEPHANIE: She says how can Chinese people
###657 not like you guys?
###658 DAVID CHOE: That's what I'm saying.
###660 [WEIRD HUMMING]
###663 DAVID CHOE: Whoa, what's going on back here?
###666 Something's happening.
###667 
###671 Oh, whoa.
###672 HARRY KIM: [SINGING]
###675 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###683 HARRY KIM: [SINGING]
###686 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###692 DAVID CHOE: You'll be rich.
###694 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###697 HARRY KIM: [SINGING]
###703 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###704 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###705 STEPHANIE: Oh, Badaling.
###706 We're almost at the first stop of the Great Wall of China.
###711 [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###713 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###714 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###716 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###717 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###719 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###722 DAVID CHOE: This is fucking great.
###724 The guy is dropping me by the Great Wall of China.
###727 I've fucking wanted to paint the Great Wall of China my
###729 entire life, and it's happening now.
###732 Man, I'm in love with this country.
###733 I love China, I love Stephanie, I love Harry, I
###736 love this girl, I love her son, and I love the guy.
###739 
###747 Bye!
###749 Is this the Great Wall of China?
###751 STEPHANIE: No, it's right there, fool.
###752 DAVID CHOE: Oh my god!
###753 STEPHANIE: You're fucking retarded.
###756 DAVID CHOE: Oh my god, dude.
###758 This is fucking awesome.
###760 Just got our first ride, and he dropped us off at the Great
###762 fucking Wall of China.
###764 I'm going to fucking paint that shit, dude, it's awesome.
###766 
###782 Lifetime fantasy, fulfilled.
###785 Another one, off the checklist.
###789 Was to paint the entire Great Wall of China.
###792 But that was what I was young, dumb, and full of cum.
###794 I'm fucking about to turn 33 in a couple of weeks.
###797 And one brick is enough.
###800 Right?
###800 HARRY KIM: One at a time.
###801 DAVID CHOE: Let's get out of here.
###804 Hey, fuck this shit.
###809 Hey, everyone.
###810 More human shit at the Great Wall.
###812 Fucking take a shit at the Great Wall.
###816 STEPHANIE: Grow up.
###817 
###823 DAVID CHOE: So we're eating at this restaurant, and I don't
###826 understand Chinese and Stephanie's taking a shit.
###828 But basically, I think these girls think Harry's Buddha.
###832 They started rubbing his belly and catcalling him.
###834 Look at him, they're loving it.
###836 
###845 He just danced and took pictures
###847 with them for an hour.
###847 They gave us a free tofu and a free chicken.
###851 The guy's a pimp, man.
###852 He's fucking Buddha.
###853 The funky Buddha.
###854 Look, all the chefs came out to see us.
###856 Look.
###857 FEMALE SPEAKER: I love you!
###858 [LAUGHTER]
###861 DAVID CHOE: Give her a kiss!
###863 HARRY KIM: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###864 FEMALE SPEAKER: I love you!
###865 
###875 DAVID CHOE: Another day, another show.
###877 Day four.
###879 "Thumbs Up" Chinese.
###883 Yesterday was a pretty amazing day.
###886 We have a wonderful new addition to the team.
###888 Miss Stephanie is here to help us.
###892 I don't think I've ever gotten a ride so quickly.
###895 She did a fail on the first ride and then we got picked up
###897 on the second one by a tour bus couple.
###899 And then we offered them our singing dog boy Harry as a
###905 side show attraction.
###906 And they refused, but they did give us a pretty awesome ride.
###910 I got to fulfill my lifelong fantasy of
###912 painting the Great Wall.
###913 And then we ended up in a town last night called--
###916 hey, what's the name of this town?
###917 STEPHANIE: We're in Datong, right?
###919 DAVID CHOE: We're in Datong.
###920 DAVID CHOE: They said it's the stepping point to Mongolia.
###923 But it's also the dust bowl of China.
###926 DAVID CHOE: Mongolia?
###927 STEPHANIE: We should go west along the Yellow River.
###929 DAVID CHOE: All right, let's go.
###933 I got this suit made, and the crotch
###936 ripped while I was squatting.
###939 I don't know how to sew, so I have duct tape
###942 and this red shit.
###944 Stephanie, she found a place to get my pants fixed.
###953 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###954 DAVID CHOE: I went like this.
###956 I went like this and it went (RIPPING SOUND).
###959 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###965 They want you to go inside.
###966 
###969 Did I scare the ladies off?
###971 It's right here.
###973 
###987 So, not a good day for me.
###990 I ripped my pants.
###991 I just got my pants fixed.
###995 I'm pretty sick, I think I have the flu, and I have
###998 explosive diarrhea.
###1000 I had to shit four times this morning already, almost once
###1002 in my pants.
###1004 
###1006 All right, let's go.
###1007 
###1010 Either the Chinese Santa Claus lives here, or the Chinese
###1014 Spider-Man.
###1015 
###1018 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1019 MR. HUANG: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1020 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1021 His name is Mr. Huang.
###1022 DAVID CHOE: Mr. Huang.
###1023 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1024 MR. HUANG: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1026 STEPHANIE: He's already married.
###1027 DAVID CHOE: Tell him he's very handsome.
###1029 You're very handsome.
###1030 You're beautiful.
###1030 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1032 DAVID CHOE: You have a killer smile.
###1033 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1034 MR. HUANG: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1036 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1037 He's the hottest dude in Datong.
###1038 DAVID CHOE: Tell him, can he give us a ride?
###1040 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1042 DAVID CHOE: Harry will dance in the car [INAUDIBLE].
###1044 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1050 DAVID CHOE: Things are so easy when you
###1051 have tits and a pussy.
###1053 Look at them.
###1054 
###1055 These guys got jizz coming out of their ears.
###1060 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1061 OK.
###1062 DAVID CHOE: OK, Let's go.
###1063 
###1075 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1079 MR. ZHAO: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1081 DAVID CHOE: That was the fucking slowest
###1082 ride we ever got.
###1083 This fucking vehicle we're riding is
###1085 powered by sesame oil.
###1086 
###1096 You like that?
###1098 You like it?
###1098 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1099 MR. ZHAO: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1100 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1101 DAVID CHOE: I'm an interior decorator.
###1103 I'm going to paint this house for you, OK?
###1105 This is for you.
###1107 
###1119 Harry, come here.
###1121 I'm going to paint you.
###1124 HARRY KIM: [HOWLING]
###1132 DAVID CHOE: What's his name?
###1133 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1135 MR. ZHAO: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1136 STEPHANIE: Zhao.
###1136 DAVID CHOE: Zhao.
###1137 STEPHANIE: Mr. Zhao.
###1137 DAVID CHOE: Mr. Zhao, what do you do for a living?
###1140 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1142 MR. ZHAO: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1144 STEPHANIE: He demolishes.
###1145 DAVID CHOE: He demolishes?
###1146 So we'll definitely help him.
###1147 
###1169 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1172 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1174 DAVID CHOE: Ask him if any of these give you energy.
###1176 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1177 DAVID CHOE: Sensual.
###1178 Sensual power.
###1179 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1180 DAVID CHOE: No, no, no, this power.
###1182 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1184 DAVID CHOE: Which of these makes my dick hardest?
###1185 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1188 STEPHANIE: He says this one makes your cum more flavorful.
###1191 DAVID CHOE: This one?
###1192 STEPHANIE: This one.
###1193 DAVID CHOE: This peanut that's a little bit burnt gives your
###1197 jizz a little smoky, roasty flavor.
###1201 Who's the boss?
###1201 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1202 DAVID CHOE: You're the boss?
###1204 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]

###1215 Please?
###1216 Please?
###1217 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1232 DAVID CHOE: Ride or die, China.
###1234 Fucking love you.
###1236 We could never have this much luck getting rides.
###1240 Pussy power.
###1240 I love women.
###1241 STEPHANIE: Panda.
###1242 Panda titties.
###1243 DAVID CHOE: (LAUGHS) Panda titties rule.
###1246 
###1256 Thank you for the ride.
###1257 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1258 MR. XI: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1260 DAVID CHOE: How old is he?
###1262 STEPHANIE: [SPEAKING CHINESE]
