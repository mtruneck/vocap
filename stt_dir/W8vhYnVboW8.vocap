###11 BRYAN IGUCHI: Yeah, so you know if the rest of you guys
###14 split we can all just partnership with Trav, film,
###17 and like, these jumps are already built.
###19 So it's really just a matter of going out and just
###22 sessioning.
###22 And these guys are pros.
###24 That's why, my gut feelings is just to stick with our plan
###26 and not try to start from scratch again.
###29 Because, I think we've been out there.
###31 We know the snow's good.
###32 And we know what's going on.
###33 We're confident in what we can do, at least.
###37 And then just to reset a whole new plan, right now, I think,
###40 would be counterproductive.
###42 PAT BRIDGES: Probably around the time that Subjekt
###44 Haakonsen and those movies, he moved to Jackson Hole, which
###47 is like the big mountain mecca, as far as the lower 48
###49 states goes.
###50 Here's a guy who consciously went against what was
###54 marketable about him, what his sponsors expected of him, but
###57 he did what he had to do as a snowboarder.
###60 DAVE DOWNING: I know we went to Jackson Hole, actually, I
###62 remember the trip.
###63 It was with Standard Films.
###65 We were filming for this, I think it was TV5, and we had a
###69 really sick week in Jackson Hole.
###71 It was super sick.
###72 Like powder, epic.
###73 We were filming on the resort and stuff.
###75 And I think he just fell in love with the place, you know?
###78 And he just made a decision to just live there, and just
###83 became a mountain man.
###84 KEVIN JONES: And I believe that next year, I believe
###86 that's when, I think, Burton dropped him, basically for
###88 moving to Jackson Hole, of all things.
###90 It's like, oh you could never be a professional
###92 snowboarder out there.
###94 He was so ahead of his time.
###96 And I think that he really found himself, in a lot of
###100 ways, and what his snowboarding
###102 was going to be about.
###103 MIKE RANQUET: He moved there at a time when his career was
###105 pretty high.
###106 And he didn't just move there, he disappeared there.
###109 And he didn't go there for fame and glory.
###113 He went there for mountains and snow.
###116 BRYAN IGUCHI: I was at a point where I felt
###117 stagnant in my riding.
###118 And I saw the only progression as be a big mountain,
###122 freestyle, snowboarder.
###124 And that was the way, where I saw the sport going.
###127 And that's why I wanted my film parts to be able to get
###130 these tricks off cliffs, or off natural kickers in the
###133 back country.
###133 And that's what I saw as my progression.
###137 WILLIE MCMILLON: He was a pretty big deal.
###138 Jackson was still pretty low key at that time.
###141 And I've always been pretty protective of this place.
###147 So when he moved here, I don't know if I was threatened by
###151 some big name coming here.
###153 Or just kind of worried about him blowing this
###157 place out, or something.
###158 But I kind of gave him a pretty hard time
###162 when he moved here.
###162 I don't even know if he even knew I was vibing him.
###165 But I was just kind of a dick to him.
###170 BRYAN IGUCHI: I had a realization, I think, that I
###173 was this professional snowboarder and I didn't
###174 really know anything about the mountains.
###176 You know?
###177 I knew how to ride a snowboard.
###179 I knew how to do tricks.
###180 But I didn't know anything about
###183 avalanches, or what was possible.
###185 Or how to get around the mountain safely.
###187 The reality sank in that, man, this is a dangerous pursuit.
###190 And I've got to get to know what I'm riding.
###194 And I wanted to explore more of the back country.
###198 WILLIE MCMILLON: He played it so cool.
###200 He didn't come into town and just bring all these crews in,
###204 and do all this shit, whatever.
###206 He like, laid really low and just kind of naturally became
###211 part of the scene.
###213 We're like, this guy's got to be pretty cool if he gave up
###216 all this fame and stuff, in California, to come out here
###219 and just hideout, and ride powder.
###221 BRYAN IGUCHI: It was kind of like a career
###223 suicide, in a sense.
###225 It was taking myself out of everything that I had built,
###228 the snowboard park, freestyle snowboarding thing.
###232 And just going exactly opposite.
###233 I wanted to keep snowboarding fun for myself, not for
###238 necessarily my sponsors.
###239 I saw a different way to progress.
###241 PAT BRIDGES: He was the first rider to sit there and put his
###243 money where his mouth was.
###244 A lot of people are like, oh yeah, I'm going to go and I'm
###246 going to work on big mountain freestyle, and make it
###250 technical in the big mountains.
###252 He really laid it all on the line.
###253 And for a while, I mean, he kind of paid the price.
###256 Because it wasn't what his sponsors, at the
###258 time, wanted from him.
###261 So he was kind of in the wilderness, as
###263 far as that's concerned.
###264 But I mean, he was riding every day.
###266 WILLIE MCMILLON: He was here for a while.
###267 I think his sponsors were cool with it, whatever.
###270 And then it just seemed like at one point it was just a
###275 domino effect of his sponsors dropping him.
###278 You know?
###279 And at one point he was printing t-shirts for
###282 Bluebird, getting like $10 an hour.
###285 He was just back in the working class, dealing with
###290 like, what the fuck do I do now?
###292 BRYAN IGUCHI: I just kept snowboarding.
###293 Because whether I was making good money or not, I was still
###297 doing whatever I had to do to snowboard.
###300 I started apprenticing as a sushi chef, and working at the
###303 local sushi bar.
###304 And I just kept riding, though, regardless of what was
###309 going on with my sponsors, or with my career, I guess.
###313 It was just more about the riding.
###315 WILLIE MCMILLON: And it was just kind of a crazy winter.
###318 Because you would just kind of see this aftermath of that
###321 crew up on the mountain.
###324 And that's kind of when I started to maybe really have a
###327 lot of respect for him.
###329 You didn't see those guys hit anything, but you just saw
###332 their lines.
###332 And people would be like, oh yeah, Guch did this today, and
###336 Johann did that.
###338 I was kind of bummed, at that point, that I was like such a
###341 dick to him, because I was like, I want to go shred with
###344 those dudes, you know?
###345 TRAVIS RICE: We were out at Teton Village
###347 riding here, in Jackson.
###348 One day were out there in the morning, and they used to have
###352 this tram tower that had a clock with a bell on it, and
###356 it would ring like every hour.
###358 It was like gong, gong.
###360 My buddy and I were walking along the path, going up to
###363 the ski resort.
###364 We're rolling out.
###365 My buddy stops me and we both look up, and here's Johan and
###369 Bryan Iguchi like walking.
###371 And it was so weird.
###372 I remember it so specifically to this day.
###375 Right at that moment, dude, the hour clock gonged.
###379 And it was like, I think it was nine gongs long.
###381 It was like right at the beginning of the day.
###383 And just, gong, this thing was like, it was slow motion.
###387 And sure enough, Bryan and Johan
###390 Olofsson go walking along.
###391 BRYAN IGUCHI: As a snowboarder that was only way I was going
###393 to progress.
###394 It was going to be doing another rotation off a jump.
###397 I wasn't really that interested in continuing to
###400 keep spinning into oblivion.
###402 I wanted to be able to ride a big mountain, and be able to
###405 ride a steep line.
###406 And be able to do tricks within that line.
###409 And basically, Travis Rice is exactly what I wanted to be.
###413 That's kind of funny.
###415 I might not have achieved it, but it was cool
###417 seeing him do it.
###420 TRAVIS RICE: Seeing Guch, every now and then, even
###422 though he was a resident at that point, it was kind of
###428 like seeing an albino Buffalo, or something rare.
###431 Something mystical, perhaps, I don't know, some type of horse
###436 with a horn coming straight out.
###439 He's a mystical creature that lived in Jackson.
###442 You never saw him though.
###443 He's like an owl.
###445 BRYAN IGUCHI: My riding's evolved.
###447 And it's still evolving.
###448 I'm progressing more on trying to educate myself and get in
###452 my head wrapped around the mountains.
###454 And trying to do what I do, and do it safely.
###457 And it's all timing in the mountains.
###460 And you've got to get out there when it's good.
###463 And you've got to know when to pull back.
###467 TRAVIS RICE: So yeah, years went on, years went on, and
###470 the Guch actually took me into the back country
###473 for the first time.
###474 Later that year, the same filmer, Rich Goodwin, actually
###477 invited me down to tag along with Lance Pitman and Bryan
###481 Iguchi go down to go to Superpark, which was this big
###484 event that they do in Mammoth Lakes, California.
###487 Which is like this big park they built.
###489 They invite all the pros in the world, come shred.
###491 And I went down there, I wasn't invited but Guch was
###495 able to have some kind words with the guys that were
###498 putting the event on.
###499 And got me in.
###500 And I ended up, after like five or six days, getting MPV
###505 Superpark, which is kind of how I got started in
###507 snowboarding.
###508 BRYAN IGUCHI: These photos are taken by Ari Marcopoulos in, I
###511 think, 1997.
###513 Yeah, this is kind of the first years here in Jackson.
###515 And you had like Jamie Lynn, and Terry, Johan.
###522 Johan actually lived here for a little bit then, in '97.
###525 Spent two season's out here with me.
###527 Grillo lived with me, as well.
###528 And my buddy, Tim.
###530 We grew up together in California and
###532 moved out here together.
###533 Kind of came here for a season, to Jackson Hole, and
###535 ended 16 years later still doing it.
###538 
###540 PAT BRIDGES: It wasn't coincidence that he was out
###542 there on the hill when the cameras came back to find him
###545 in Jackson, because he would be riding, no matter what.
###548 He would be rolling sushi at night and
###551 riding during the day.
###553 That's what Guch did.
###554 Anybody who went to Jackson, for the last 15 years, you
###558 knew you could find him in the lift line.
###560 That's what he did.
###562 And unlike a lot of other people in his peer group from
###566 that first big early '90s, freestyle movement, a lot of
###571 those guys maybe they wanted to do what Guch did.
###575 Maybe they tried, but they didn't have the patience that
###577 he had, for the sport to catch back up on him.
###580 WILLIE MCMILLON: He wasn't even like getting paid or
###581 anything to snowboard.
###583 He started shooting with the Grenade and somehow he just
###590 like carved his way back in with this
###595 eternal legend status.
###598 There's like this or three year period where he was just
###601 working his ass off, filming every single day, just like
###605 stepping up his riding, everything.
###608 Before you knew it, he was just like, back in the mags,
###611 back in videos.
###613 Volcom picks him back up.
###615 All this great stuff started happening for me.
###618 And now he's where he's at now.
###619 And he's like the dude that everybody calls when
###623 they come to town.
###624 DAVE DOWNING: Yeah, some people could say, Bryan's
###627 making a comeback.
###627 Or he's a sponsored snowboarder again.
###629 And that's true.
###630 But I don't think Bryan really went anywhere.
###633 He was still snowboarding.
###635 He just wasn't doing it in front of a camera.
###637 WILLIE MCMILLON: And him and Lance Pitman just started
###640 exploring all these mountains.
###642 And I'd probably say that Guch and Lance found 90% of the
###647 spots that people are filming at now.
###651 Now Guch brings--
###652 he's got to show the Volcom crew around,
###654 and all that stuff.
###655 But it's kind of like, well he kind of found all these spots.
###659 TRAVIS RICE: He came in, fresh eyes.
###660 He's like, there's mountains 360 degrees
###664 around Jackson Hole.
###665 That's why it's called a hole.
###667 Wonder what's up there, or up there?
###670 So he set off on a quest to go to discover what
###672 the hell was up there.
###673 And I was lucky enough to get on board years later.
###678 And he kind of showed me the ropes.
###681 WILLIE MCMILLON: It's kind of the place where when people
###684 just get over the nonsense, they come out here.
###688 And now there's like enough cool people out here, that
###690 it's accepted.
###692 Like, I'm moving to Jackson, and your sponsors
###694 are like, right on.
###695 BRYAN FOX: For like a kid in Southern California to see
###698 someone from Southern California leave and turn into
###701 a back country, more or less like wilderness snowboarder
###707 type of guys, that's definitely inspiring.
###710 WILLIE MCMILLON: I think Harrison Ford is
###712 kind of like the Guch.
###713 You know, like, Harrison Ford made it cool for Hollywood
###718 people to move out here.
###719 And Guch made it cool for pro snowboarders to move out here.
###723 -Oh, good.
###724 We got all the dirt on you now. dirt on you now.
###725 BRYAN IGUCHI: Oh, no.
###726 WILLIE MCMILLON: I talked so much shit, dude, it wasn't
###728 even funny.
###730 No, I kept it clean.
###732 -Your career is over.
###733 BRYAN IGUCHI: Damn it.
###734 You spoiled it.
###735 WILLIE MCMILLON: No.
###737 We kept it family style.
###739
