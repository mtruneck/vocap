1
0:0:15,431 --> 0:0:18,101
I address you tonight,


2
0:0:18,101 --> 0:0:22,941
not as the President of the United States,


3
0:0:22,941 --> 0:0:26,81
not as the leader of a country,


4
0:0:26,81 --> 0:0:31,162
but as a citizen of humanity.


5
0:0:31,162 --> 0:0:36,42
We are faced with the very gravest of challenges.


6
0:0:36,42 --> 0:0:42,172
The Bible calls this day Armageddon, the end of all things.


7
0:0:42,172 --> 0:0:45,382
And yet, for the first time...


8
0:0:45,382 --> 0:0:48,52
in the history of the planet,


9
0:0:48,52 --> 0:0:50,722
a species has the technology...


10
0:0:50,722 --> 0:0:55,62
to prevent its own extinction.


11
0:0:55,62 --> 0:0:58,982
All of you praying with us need to know...


12
0:0:58,982 --> 0:1:3,443
that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster...


13
0:1:3,443 --> 0:1:8,533
is being called into service.


14
0:1:8,533 --> 0:1:12,113
The human thirst for excellence,


15
0:1:12,113 --> 0:1:15,703
knowledge,


16
0:1:15,703 --> 0:1:19,543
every step up the ladder of science,


17
0:1:19,543 --> 0:1:24,463
every adventurous reach into space,


18
0:1:24,463 --> 0:1:30,133
all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought,


19
0:1:30,133 --> 0:1:32,763
have provided us the tools...


20
0:1:32,763 --> 0:1:36,184
to wage this terrible battle.


21
0:1:36,184 --> 0:1:38,604
Through all the chaos that is our history,


22
0:1:38,604 --> 0:1:43,444
through all of the wrongs and the discord, through all of the pain and suffering,


23
0:1:43,444 --> 0:1:48,654
through all of our times, there is one thing that has...


24
0:1:48,654 --> 0:1:51,454
nourished our souls...  Mom, that salesman's on TV.


25
0:1:51,454 --> 0:1:54,114
and elevated our species above its origins,


26
0:1:54,114 --> 0:1:56,624
and that is our courage.


27
0:1:56,624 --> 0:1:59,954
Dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight...


28
0:1:59,954 --> 0:2:2,754
on those 14 brave souls...


29
0:2:2,754 --> 0:2:5,254
travelling into the heavens.


30
0:2:5,254 --> 0:2:7,805
That man's not a salesman.


31
0:2:7,805 --> 0:2:10,95
That's your daddy.  And may we all,


32
0:2:10,95 --> 0:2:14,55
citizens the world over, see these events through.


33
0:2:14,55 --> 0:2:25,985
Godspeed and good luck to you.


34
0:2:25,985 --> 0:2:33,495
Freedom crew. Independence crew.


35
0:2:33,495 --> 0:2:37,86
How ya feelin'?  Uh, good, you know.


36
0:2:37,86 --> 0:2:41,376
I mean, considering I've never been this scared in my entire life. I You know


37
0:2:41,376 --> 0:2:45,46
Listen. Once you get up there, you're gonna be on your own.


38
0:2:45,46 --> 0:2:49,176
If anything should happen, I just wanted to  I know, Harry.


39
0:2:49,176 --> 0:2:53,806
I'll, uh, try not to disappoint you.


40
0:2:53,806 --> 0:3:2,106
Take care of yourself, kid.


41
0:3:2,106 --> 0:3:5,856
Freedom's on the bridge. Attention in the firing room.


42
0:3:5,856 --> 0:3:10,987
Oxidizer loading is complete. Independence's on the bridge.


43
0:3:10,987 --> 0:3:23,797
Attention all personnel. We are T-minus two hours to the programme goal.


44
0:3:23,797 --> 0:3:26,637
Hey, Harry.  Yeah, Rock?


45
0:3:26,637 --> 0:3:30,57
You know, we're sittin' on four million pounds of fuel, one nuclear weapon...


46
0:3:30,57 --> 0:3:33,177
and a thing that has 270,000 moving parts...


47
0:3:33,177 --> 0:3:35,637
built by the lowest bidder.


48
0:3:35,637 --> 0:3:41,978
Makes you feel good, doesn't it?  Yeah.


49
0:3:41,978 --> 0:3:44,568
How ya doin', Oscar?  Great.


50
0:3:44,568 --> 0:3:47,68
I got that excited, scared feelin'


51
0:3:47,68 --> 0:3:50,278
like 98 percent excited, 2 percent scared.


52
0:3:50,278 --> 0:3:54,368
Maybe more. It could be 2 It could be 98 percent scared, 2 percent excited.


53
0:3:54,368 --> 0:4:0,208
But that's what makes it so intense, is it's so confused. I can't really figure it out.


54
0:4:0,208 --> 0:4:3,128
Will you make mine really tight, 'cause I don't want to fall out?


55
0:4:3,128 --> 0:4:5,976
I mean, almost to the point of cutting off circulation.


56
0:4:5,976 --> 0:4:8,48
Ow.


57
0:4:8,48 --> 0:4:11,178
It must be a comfort to know that if the space programme goes under,


58
0:4:11,178 --> 0:4:13,559
you can always get a job at Helga's House of Pain, huh?


59
0:4:13,559 --> 0:4:16,99
All right. Flight directors on with the go/nogo for launch.


60
0:4:16,99 --> 0:4:18,599

66
0:4:34,869 --> 0:4:39,459
All crew members, close and lock your visors.


67
0:4:39,459 --> 0:4:43,13
Independence, this is launch control. Be advised, we're in a smooth count.


68
0:4:43,13 --> 0:4:46,3
T minus 31. You're go for autosequence start.

Okay, gentlemen, you're our warriors up there. God be with you.


71
0:4:54,43 --> 0:4:59,15
You're already heroes. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

0:5:12,2 --> 0:5:16,331
We have main engine start.


76
0:5:16,331 --> 0:5:18,961
We have booster ignition.  We're going.


77
0:5:18,961 --> 0:5:31,261
And liftoff.


78
0:5:31,261 --> 0:5:34,681
Freedom, this is flight deck.


79
0:5:34,681 --> 0:5:49,572
Roger, Freedom. You're looking good.


80
0:5:49,572 --> 0:5:54,532

0:5:54,532 --> 0:5:57,662

We have liftoff.  We are cooking, Houston.

0:6:22,943 --> 0:6:27,573
Houston, the tower is clear. They're all yours.


84
0:6:27,573 --> 0:6:30,743
Heads up, everybody. They're ours now.


85
0:6:30,743 --> 0:6:41,213
All engines are go.  Keep a sharp eye out on both of 'em.


86
0:6:41,213 --> 0:6:53,764
Start roll manoeuvre.


87
0:6:53,764 --> 0:6:57,144
Two good roll programmes.  One down.  Independence, we have max cue.


88
0:6:57,144 --> 0:7:1,194
Roger, Control. We are a max cue.


89
0:7:1,194 --> 0:7:7,784
S.R.B. sep


90
0:7:7,784 --> 0:7:11,154
We are singleengine, press, demigo.  Copy, press, demigo.


91
0:7:11,154 --> 0:7:19,124
Houston, this is a kickass ride!


92
0:7:19,124 --> 0:7:32,475
Freedom, this is Houston. Main engine cut out on schedule. Out.


93
0:7:32,475 --> 0:7:39,145
Freedom, stats are good.


94
0:7:39,145 --> 0:7:42,195
Independence, telemetry is up and running.  Oh, my God.


95
0:7:42,195 --> 0:7:46,115
This is space! 'Course, we're just in the beginning part of space.


96
0:7:46,115 --> 0:7:48,695
WeWe haven't gotten to outer space yet.


97
0:7:48,695 --> 0:7:54,666
Roger, Houston. We have a visual on the Russian space station. Initiating retro burn.


98
0:7:54,666 --> 0:7:58,416
Gentlemen, remember the Russian space station has been up there for 11 years.


99
0:7:58,416 --> 0:8:0,836
Most of us don't have cars that old.


100
0:8:0,836 --> 0:8:7,176
Now, the cosmonaut on board has been on that tin can for 18 months, alone.


101
0:8:7,176 --> 0:10:7,176
So don't be surprised if he's a little... off.
