0:0:17,75 --> 0:0:19,16
SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: Whenever
Pakistan comes on the


3
0:0:19,16 --> 0:0:23,25
news these days, the context is
either floods, the Taliban,


4
0:0:23,25 --> 0:0:25,96
political assassinations, or
violence at the hands of


5
0:0:25,96 --> 0:0:28,51
suicide bombers.


6
0:0:28,51 --> 0:0:30,71
We wanted to see it for
ourselves, so we got on a


7
0:0:30,71 --> 0:0:32,17
plane and flew to Peshawar.


8
0:0:32,17 --> 0:0:35,7
It's a city right on the border
of the tribal areas, a


9
0:0:35,7 --> 0:0:36,8
lawless region sandwiched
between


10
0:0:36,8 --> 0:0:39,93
Afghanistan and Pakistan.


11
0:0:39,93 --> 0:0:43,11
Back in 2006, we came to the
region to film a story about


12
0:0:43,11 --> 0:0:46,27
the largest illegal gun market
in the world in a town called


13
0:0:46,27 --> 0:0:47,628
Darra Adamkhel.

[LAUGHTER]


17
0:0:51,185 --> 0:0:52,44
SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: Our
host was a guy named Naeem


18
0:0:52,44 --> 0:0:55,54
Afridi who was the Director of
Protocol for the provincial


19
0:0:55,54 --> 0:0:56,79
government.


20
0:0:56,79 --> 0:1:1,38



21
0:1:1,38 --> 0:1:2,46
SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING:
On the recent trip, we


22
0:1:2,46 --> 0:1:3,255
called Naeem again.


23
0:1:3,255 --> 0:1:5,459
And as soon as we met, he
explained that things in


24
0:1:5,459 --> 0:1:8,13
Pakistan and Peshawar,
specifically, had spiraled


25
0:1:8,13 --> 0:1:11,173
downward into a cesspool of
militancy and fundamentalism.


26
0:1:11,173 --> 0:1:22,94



27
0:1:22,94 --> 0:1:24,75
SUROOSH ALVI: Now, I was here
four years ago, and it was


28
0:1:24,75 --> 0:1:25,82
totally different.


29
0:1:25,82 --> 0:1:28,46
And now, everyone's scared.


30
0:1:28,46 --> 0:1:36,98



31
0:1:36,98 --> 0:1:38,13
SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: We drove
to the Pearl Continental


32
0:1:38,13 --> 0:1:41,54
Hotel, the same place we stayed
on our last visit.


33
0:1:41,54 --> 0:1:42,94
SUROOSH ALVI: So, that's
the driveway


34
0:1:42,94 --> 0:1:45,8
coming into the hotel.


35
0:1:45,8 --> 0:1:47,96
There was a car that drove in
very fast, and there was a


36
0:1:47,96 --> 0:1:50,61
bomb blast here six
months ago.


37
0:1:50,61 --> 0:1:55,4
And four years ago, those little
walls didn't exist.


38
0:1:55,4 --> 0:1:58,21
And there are about
25 to 30 armed


39
0:1:58,21 --> 0:2:1,39
guards inside this compound.


40
0:2:1,39 --> 0:2:2,98
I feel like I'm the only
person staying here.


41
0:2:2,98 --> 0:2:6,22



42
0:2:6,22 --> 0:2:8,27
SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: After
9/11, the US bombed the hell


43
0:2:8,27 --> 0:2:10,509
out of Afghanistan and
toppled the Taliban.


44
0:2:10,509 --> 0:2:12,8
The remaining soldiers scrambled
over the porous


45
0:2:12,8 --> 0:2:15,68
border into the tribal areas of
Pakistan, and that's where


46
0:2:15,68 --> 0:2:17,3
they started to plot
their comeback.


47
0:2:17,3 --> 0:2:19,66
What a lot of people don't
realize is that because of all


48
0:2:19,66 --> 0:2:22,43
of this, a second Taliban
movement was formed called the


49
0:2:22,43 --> 0:2:25,85
Pakistani Taliban or
Tehrik-i-Taliban.


50
0:2:25,85 --> 0:2:27,54
SUROOSH ALVI: You know,
there's two Talibans--


51
0:2:27,54 --> 0:2:29,99
the one in Afghanistan and
the one in Pakistan.


52
0:2:29,99 --> 0:2:36,24
And the ones here have created
a lot of fear in Peshawar.


53
0:2:36,24 --> 0:2:37,71
This is the office
for The News.


54
0:2:37,71 --> 0:2:39,99
It's one of the largest
newspapers in the country.


55
0:2:39,99 --> 0:2:42,38
We're here to meet Rahimullah
Yusefzai.


56
0:2:42,38 --> 0:2:45,56
He is the most respected
journalist in the country.


57
0:2:45,56 --> 0:2:48,5
He was the first guy to ever go
visit with the Taliban and


58
0:2:48,5 --> 0:2:49,76
interview them.


59
0:2:49,76 --> 0:2:52,51
And he was also the last guy to
ever get an interview with


60
0:2:52,51 --> 0:2:54,89
Osama bin Laden, who he's
interviewed twice.


61
0:2:54,89 --> 0:2:57,41
And he is regarded
as the foremost


62
0:2:57,41 --> 0:2:59,24
authority on the Taliban.


63
0:2:59,24 --> 0:3:2,32
And he's made some time
to meet with us.


64
0:3:2,32 --> 0:3:4,55
Could you explain the difference
between the Afghani


65
0:3:4,55 --> 0:3:6,6
Taliban and the Pakistan
Taliban?


66
0:3:6,6 --> 0:3:8,17
RAHIMULLAH YUSEFZAI: The
Pakistani Taliban were


67
0:3:8,17 --> 0:3:12,71
inspired by the Afghan
Taliban.


68
0:3:12,71 --> 0:3:15,15
They have the same values.


69
0:3:15,15 --> 0:3:18,5
The Pakistani Taliban look
to the Afghan Taliban for


70
0:3:18,5 --> 0:3:19,49
leadership.


71
0:3:19,49 --> 0:3:23,76
The Pakistani Taliban were happy
to fight in Afghanistan


72
0:3:23,76 --> 0:3:28,74
until the Pakistan government,
under US pressure, started


73
0:3:28,74 --> 0:3:31,13
action against them
in Pakistan.


74
0:3:31,13 --> 0:3:33,78
Then they started
looking inwards.


75
0:3:33,78 --> 0:3:36,3
They began fighting the
Pakistani state.


76
0:3:36,3 --> 0:3:39,245
So I think their main battle
now is in Pakistan.


77
0:3:39,245 --> 0:3:43,43



78
0:3:43,43 --> 0:3:46,1
SUROOSH ALVI: So, buddy, this
road looks familiar.


79
0:3:46,1 --> 0:3:48,1
We've been on it before
when we went to


80
0:3:48,1 --> 0:3:49,58
Darra to the gun markets.


81
0:3:49,58 --> 0:3:50,24
NAEEM AFRIDI: Yeah.


82
0:3:50,24 --> 0:3:53,285
NARRATOR: And so why can't we
go into the tribal areas?


83
0:3:53,285 --> 0:4:4,74



84
0:4:4,74 --> 0:4:7,7
SUROOSH ALVI: We're driving up
to a site where there was a


85
0:4:7,7 --> 0:4:8,47
bomb blast.


86
0:4:8,47 --> 0:4:11,535
The Taliban tried to
kill the police.


87
0:4:11,535 --> 0:4:13,3
It's a checkpoint.


88
0:4:13,3 --> 0:4:16,41
I'm standing here on the border
of the tribal areas,


89
0:4:16,41 --> 0:4:19,959
and just four kilometers that
way is the gun market where we


90
0:4:19,959 --> 0:4:21,649
filmed four years ago.


91
0:4:21,649 --> 0:4:24,12
That area has been taken
over by the Taliban.


92
0:4:24,12 --> 0:4:28,1
And these guys here, they battle
with the Taliban on a


93
0:4:28,1 --> 0:4:28,836
regular basis.

in Darra, they do


103
0:4:54,2 --> 0:4:58,7
knock off this gun, but this
one has come from abroad.

SUROOSH ALVI:

114
0:5:12,74 --> 0:5:15,53
So this was built in 1986.


115
0:5:15,53 --> 0:5:18,47
This is a very important piece
of history here because this


116
0:5:18,47 --> 0:5:20,75
is where all the problems
stem from.


117
0:5:20,75 --> 0:5:24,14
When the Soviets invaded
Afghanistan, they came in.


118
0:5:24,14 --> 0:5:27,52
And there was a lot of leftover
Russian artillery.


119
0:5:27,52 --> 0:5:30,99
And since that time, this
Kalashnikov culture has been


120
0:5:30,99 --> 0:5:32,85
pervading Pakistan.

0:5:34,1 --> 0:6:2,45

it's pretty heavy


124
0:6:4,347 --> 0:6:5,52

125
0:6:5,52 --> 0:6:9,13
They're scanning
suspicious-looking people and


126
0:6:9,13 --> 0:6:11,54
trying to find guns, explosives,
and what not.


127
0:6:11,54 --> 0:6:14,41
There was a single bomb blast
that blew up the market over


128
0:6:14,41 --> 0:6:17,85
there, the mosque behind me,
the armored vehicle over


129
0:6:17,85 --> 0:6:21,46
there, and the police station,
and about 50 people died.


130
0:6:21,46 --> 0:6:23,1
One of the guys who
died was wearing


131
0:6:23,1 --> 0:6:25,54
this bulletproof jacket.


132
0:6:25,54 --> 0:6:30,9
And the soldier who died, they
buried him right here.


133
0:6:30,9 --> 0:6:31,69
Yikes.


134
0:6:31,69 --> 0:6:32,93

SUROOSH ALVI: So the Taliban
target the police here because


140
0:6:57,63 --> 0:7:0,98
they're saying that they're
infidels, they're anti-Muslim,


141
0:7:0,98 --> 0:7:4,11
they're friends of the West,
they're collaborators.


142
0:7:4,11 --> 0:7:7,33
And that's why they become
targets, when in reality,


143
0:7:7,33 --> 0:7:8,92
they're practicing Muslims.


144

it's time to go.

I'm pushing my luck here.

OK.


153
0:7:28,844 --> 0:7:32,4
RAHIMULLAH YUSEFZAI: I think
that suicide bombing and the


154
0:7:32,4 --> 0:7:34,6
use of IEDs--


155
0:7:34,6 --> 0:7:36,74
Improvised Explosive Devices--


156
0:7:36,74 --> 0:7:41,125
that's the two most effective
weapons now available with


157
0:7:41,125 --> 0:7:42,87
militants in this part
of the world.


158
0:7:42,87 --> 0:7:47,56
The young people who agree to
become suicide bombers, I


159
0:7:47,56 --> 0:7:50,95
think their numbers
are really big.


160
0:7:50,95 --> 0:7:54,53
They can even afford to
send bombers to attack


161
0:7:54,53 --> 0:7:56,166
insignificant targets.


162
0:7:56,166 --> 0:7:58,42
They're all willing to die.


163
0:7:58,42 --> 0:8:2,35
I remember one of the Afghan
Taliban commanders, he claimed


164
0:8:2,35 --> 0:8:7,29
once that he had about 5,000
suicide bombers.


165
0:8:7,29 --> 0:8:12,79
The way they recruit people, the
way they brainwash them,


166
0:8:12,79 --> 0:8:14,51
that is very effective.


167
0:8:14,51 --> 0:8:18,76
In fact, I remember once
receiving a phone call from


168
0:8:18,76 --> 0:8:23,77
Qari Hussain, the master trainer
of suicide bombers.


169
0:8:23,77 --> 0:8:28,3
So he said, I can turn a young
man into a suicide bomber in


170
0:8:28,3 --> 0:8:29,252
half an hour.


171
0:8:29,252 --> 0:8:30,46
And I said, how come?


172
0:8:30,46 --> 0:8:34,73
He said, it's very easy because
there is so much anger


173
0:8:34,73 --> 0:8:39,24
among Muslims against America,
against the allies of the


174
0:8:39,24 --> 0:8:41,19
Western countries like
the Pakistani


175
0:8:41,19 --> 0:8:43,419
state, Pakistani army.


176
0:8:43,419 --> 0:8:46,61
He said, our villages
have been attacked.


177
0:8:46,61 --> 0:8:48,82
Our women and children
have been killed.


178
0:8:48,82 --> 0:8:56,87
So we can very easily motivate
these families to supply us


179
0:8:56,87 --> 0:8:59,69
fighters and suicide bombers.


180
0:8:59,69 --> 0:9:4,91
And he then told me that you are
an old man, but if you sit


181
0:9:4,91 --> 0:9:8,6
with me for half an hour,
I can turn you


182
0:9:8,6 --> 0:9:11,6
into a suicide bomber.


183
0:9:11,6 --> 0:9:13,93
So he's so confident of
what he is doing.

SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING:
The Taliban puts


186
0:9:34,11 --> 0:9:35,24
out videos like this.


187
0:9:35,24 --> 0:9:37,88
They used to be available in
shops around Peshawar, but


188
0:9:37,88 --> 0:9:40,19
when I went to buy them, all I
could find was Bollywood and


189
0:9:40,19 --> 0:9:41,11
pornography.


190
0:9:41,11 --> 0:9:43,85
So I got my local cameraman to
put out some feelers, and a


191
0:9:43,85 --> 0:9:46,76
militant ended up delivering a
flash drive to my hotel that


192
0:9:46,76 --> 0:9:49,16
was full of these videos
glorifying suicide bombers and


193
0:9:49,16 --> 0:9:51,13
successful missions
and executions.


194
0:9:51,13 --> 0:9:58,8



195
0:9:58,8 --> 0:10:0,17
As if dealing with the
Taliban, widespread


196
0:10:0,17 --> 0:10:2,93
fundamentalism, and suicide
bombers wasn't enough for


197
0:10:2,93 --> 0:10:6,62

terrible monsoons hit the

205
0:10:34,9 --> 0:10:50,16



206
0:10:50,16 --> 0:10:52,14
SUROOSH ALVI: This is the
aftermath of the floods, this


207
0:10:52,14 --> 0:10:54,26
total devastation.


208
0:10:54,26 --> 0:10:56,14
There's nothing left.


209
0:10:56,14 --> 0:10:57,7
They've had no aid.


210
0:10:57,7 --> 0:10:58,47
They have no money.


211
0:10:58,47 --> 0:10:59,715
No one's helping them.


212
0:10:59,715 --> 0:11:2,82
They're trying to pick up the
pieces of their lives, pick up


213
0:11:2,82 --> 0:11:5,94
these bricks and rebuild
their homes.


214
0:11:5,94 --> 0:11:7,803
They literally have nothing.


215
0:11:7,803 --> 0:11:10,41



216
0:11:10,41 --> 0:11:11,45
SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: To get
a better sense of how the


217
0:11:11,45 --> 0:11:14,21
government was responding to the
floods, I arranged to meet


218
0:11:14,21 --> 0:11:15,77
with the Bureau Chief of
the Daily Times of


219
0:11:15,77 --> 0:11:17,1
Peshawar, Iqbal Khattak.


220
0:11:17,1 --> 0:11:46,8



221
0:11:46,8 --> 0:11:49,7
MALE SPEAKER:

222
0:11:49,7 --> 0:11:50,41
SUROOSH ALVI:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


223
0:11:50,41 --> 0:11:55,8



224
0:11:55,8 --> 0:11:56,39
MALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


225
0:11:56,39 --> 0:11:57,296
SUROOSH ALVI:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


226
0:11:57,296 --> 0:11:57,94
MALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


227
0:11:57,94 --> 0:12:0,97
SUROOSH ALVI:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


228
0:12:0,97 --> 0:12:4,0
MALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


229
0:12:4,0 --> 0:12:5,22
SUROOSH ALVI:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


230
0:12:5,22 --> 0:12:8,955
MALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


231
0:12:8,955 --> 0:12:10,205
MALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


232
0:12:10,205 --> 0:12:15,44



233
0:12:15,44 --> 0:12:17,19
SUROOSH ALVI: So all these
homes around me have been


234
0:12:17,19 --> 0:12:18,344
rebuilt by the Taliban.


235
0:12:18,344 --> 0:12:19,29
MALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


236
0:12:19,29 --> 0:12:21,5
SUROOSH ALVI:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


237
0:12:21,5 --> 0:12:22,3
MALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


238
0:12:22,3 --> 0:12:33,91



239
0:12:33,91 --> 0:12:36,788
SUROOSH ALVI: So where the
government fails, the Taliban


240
0:12:36,788 --> 0:12:42,504
is stepping in and helping the
rebuilding process, thereby


241
0:12:42,504 --> 0:12:45,362
engendering goodwill and winning
the hearts and minds


242
0:12:45,362 --> 0:12:46,8
of these people.


243
0:12:46,8 --> 0:12:49,46
How many other towns are
there like this?


244
0:12:49,46 --> 0:12:49,79
NAEEM AFRIDI: So many.


245
0:12:49,79 --> 0:12:51,15
SUROOSH ALVI: So many.


246
0:12:51,15 --> 0:12:52,58
And it's all the same story.


247
0:12:52,58 --> 0:12:53,83
NAEEM AFRIDI: The same story.


248
0:12:53,83 --> 0:12:56,23



249
0:12:56,23 --> 0:12:57,86
SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: The US
government's response to the


250
0:12:57,86 --> 0:13:0,845
floods was to donate about
$150 million in


251
0:13:0,845 --> 0:13:2,58
aid, which is great.


252
0:13:2,58 --> 0:13:4,77
But it's nothing compared to
what the US is spending on


253
0:13:4,77 --> 0:13:6,81
fighting the Taliban
in Afghanistan--


254
0:13:6,81 --> 0:13:10,42
about $165 million every day.


255
0:13:10,42 --> 0:13:12,83
Part of that money is spent on
remote-controlled Predator


256
0:13:12,83 --> 0:13:15,82
drone planes used to bomb
militants not just inside of


257
0:13:15,82 --> 0:13:19,28
Afghanistan but also
inside of Pakistan.


258
0:13:19,28 --> 0:13:21,56
The drone plane attacks piss off
not only the Taliban and


259
0:13:21,56 --> 0:13:25,49
al-Qaeda, but everyone, from
civilians to the government.


260
0:13:25,49 --> 0:13:27,92
They often miss their targets,
killing innocent people.


261
0:13:27,92 --> 0:13:31,21
They're a blatant violation of
the nation's sovereignty.


262
0:13:31,21 --> 0:13:34,7
In 2008, Iqbal Kjattak met with
the Taliban commander


263
0:13:34,7 --> 0:13:37,0
Baitullah Mehsud, who explained
to him the effects


264
0:13:37,0 --> 0:13:38,25
of the American drone attacks.


265
0:13:38,25 --> 0:14:29,17



266
0:14:29,17 --> 0:14:30,69
SUROOSH ALVI: We've been in
Peshawar for a couple days,


267
0:14:30,69 --> 0:14:34,6
and I'm just trying to wrap my
brain around everything that's


268
0:14:34,6 --> 0:14:35,23
going on here.


269
0:14:35,23 --> 0:14:39,36
There's many groups and factions
and splinter groups.


270
0:14:39,36 --> 0:14:41,93
Within the Taliban itself,
there's probably 30 militant


271
0:14:41,93 --> 0:14:45,24
groups under the
Tehrik-i-Taliban umbrella


272
0:14:45,24 --> 0:14:46,9
organization.


273
0:14:46,9 --> 0:14:49,33
Then there's al-Qaeda.


274
0:14:49,33 --> 0:14:52,6
We are just driving into
a neighborhood


275
0:14:52,6 --> 0:14:53,26
called University Town.


276
0:14:53,26 --> 0:14:57,817
It is where Osama bin Laden used
to live, and it's where


277
0:14:57,817 --> 0:14:58,99
he started al-Qaeda.


278
0:14:58,99 --> 0:15:1,86
It's the birthplace
of al-Qaeda.


279
0:15:1,86 --> 0:15:4,58
And from here, we're going
to go meet with the


280
0:15:4,58 --> 0:15:9,86
Jamaat-e-Islami, who are a very
established, conservative


281
0:15:9,86 --> 0:15:11,39
Islamic movement.


282
0:15:11,39 --> 0:15:15,5
And they are al-Qaeda
friendly.


283
0:15:15,5 --> 0:15:16,75
MALE SPEAKER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


284
0:15:16,75 --> 0:16:55,36



285
0:16:55,36 --> 0:16:56,52
SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: The more
people I interviewed, the


286
0:16:56,52 --> 0:16:57,74
clearer it became.


287
0:16:57,74 --> 0:17:0,9
The Taliban and al-Qaeda in
Pakistan have abandoned the


288
0:17:0,9 --> 0:17:2,72
holier pursuit of
imposing strict


289
0:17:2,72 --> 0:17:4,22
Islamic law in the region.


290
0:17:4,22 --> 0:17:7,39
For now they're simply young,
pissed off, and vengeful


291
0:17:7,39 --> 0:17:8,66
beyond belief.


292
0:17:8,66 --> 0:17:11,8
RAHIMULLAH YUSEFZAI: You need
religion to motivate people.


293
0:17:11,8 --> 0:17:16,839
In Sharia, or Islamic, law,
jihad, these slogans are very


294
0:17:16,839 --> 0:17:19,9
handy, very effective.


295
0:17:19,9 --> 0:17:24,569
But I think that the suicide
bombings, even the attacks


296
0:17:24,569 --> 0:17:27,359
against the security forces,
the police, the Pakistani


297
0:17:27,359 --> 0:17:31,89
state, the ruling party
politicians,


298
0:17:31,89 --> 0:17:34,37
is an act of revenge.


299
0:17:34,37 --> 0:17:36,51
It's just plain revenge.


300
0:17:36,51 --> 0:17:39,52
There would be people who would
be radicalized because


301
0:17:39,52 --> 0:17:43,79
of the policies of the state,
because of this alliance with


302
0:17:43,79 --> 0:17:46,98
the US, because of American
policies in the region.


303
0:17:46,98 --> 0:17:52,316
That's why, even if there's a
solution in Pakistan, I don't


304
0:17:52,316 --> 0:17:56,33
think the problem will end
because there's a fallout on


305
0:17:56,33 --> 0:18:1,38
Pakistan of whatever is
happening in Afghanistan.


306
0:18:1,38 --> 0:18:2,882
SUROOSH ALVI NARRATING: So
after nine years and $370


307
0:18:2,882 --> 0:18:7,35
billion spent fighting against
the Taliban in Afghanistan,


308
0:18:7,35 --> 0:18:9,8
the US still seems to be
pretty far off from


309
0:18:9,8 --> 0:18:13,2
accomplishing much besides
pissing off the entire region.


310
0:18:13,2 --> 0:18:15,51
And all this is inspiring a
whole new generation of


311
0:18:15,51 --> 0:18:19,4
militants and suicide bombers
in Pakistan, a country that


312
0:18:19,4 --> 0:18:21,13
has been considered for
years to be a key ally


313
0:18:21,13 --> 0:18:22,76
in the War on Terror.


314
0:18:22,76 --> 0:18:25,55
So it seems to me, they've
got a bigger problem now.


315
0:18:25,55 --> 0:20:25,55
