###16 ARTO SAARI: I first met Dylan in Barcelona.
###19 He was just a little kid, and he had massive audios on,
###22 birdhouse board, hat backwards, long hair--
###28 same long hair.
###30 And he must have been like 14 or 15.
###33 He didn't talk much back then.
###37 INTERVIEWER: He was really quiet?
###38 ARTO SAARI: Yeah, he was pretty quiet.
###40 I was recovering from my first knee injury.
###42 I wasn't able to skate, but I was just wanted
###45 to go out and stuff.
###46 It was just me and him.
###47 I ended up filming him on some random spot, skating.
###50 I was like, come on, do something.
###53 I'm pointing the camera at you.
###55 INTERVIEWER: You were filming?
###55 ARTO SAARI: Yeah, I was filming him.
###57 And I think Anton was around.
###59 So I just tried to shoot a couple of photos and stuff.
###62 But no, he didn't have a crazy kid style.
###65 It was like--
###66 or maybe it was right at that time that he started
###70 developing it.
###72 It was early, early stages of his style.
###74 No, he was already good back then.
###77 He was actually [INAUDIBLE] before me, I think.
###79 MARK OBLOW: Basically once he started coming on all the
###82 quick trips, he just started coming into his own.
###86 And then at that time, Reese was a pretty big
###89 influence on him.
###90 And then Reese started Rasa Libre.
###92 And basically they were just like, come to Rasa Libre.
###94 And it was on.
###96 
###102 DYLAN RIEDER: Reese asked me to ride for him, Reese Forbes,
###105 because he started it with Matt.
###107 He asked me to ride for him.
###109 I was like, yeah, fuck it, let's do it.
###110 INTERVIEWER: It seemed like it had really good
###111 art direction, also.
###113 DYLAN RIEDER: The graphics were sick, man.
###114 They had awesome graphics.
###116 I think it was all like Michael Leon and stuff.
###119 I don't know if you ever saw the board.
###120 It was like, the wine bottles, and like
###123 the flowers and stuff.
###124 And then there was this one with this snake stuff on the
###130 back of it, just blank wood.
###133 There was a bunch of cool ones.
###134 I think a lot of people were paying
###135 attention to Rasa Libre.
###137 It was such an awesome company.
###140 I think that helped me out.
###143 ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: I had seen the kid around, skating,
###146 and knew that there was some special about him.
###149 Because no one had seen anything of Dylan either.
###150 All he had was this Quicksilver promo thing.
###155 MARK OBLOW: I think the TransWorld part really set him
###160 from being a little kid to being a good amateur.
###163 
###174 HEATH KIRCHART: That was kind of him coming into his own,
###176 showcasing his style of skating.
###178 So the TransWorld video was I think when probably most
###181 people learned about him.
###182 ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: I feel like he was on the--
###184 he was working on that, riding for Rasa Libre.
###187 And then Rasa Libre fell apart, I feel like, in the
###191 middle of that video.
###192 And he finished it out riding Workshop boards.
###195 I want to say that he did.
###197 Or that transition was happening, or something.
###202 DYLAN RIEDER: I don't really know, honestly.
###204 I mean, I was pretty young at the time.
###206 I didn't think it was like, oh, it's
###206 going out of business.
###207 I mean, whatever, cool.
###210 MARK OBLOW: You know, at that time, when the Rasa Libre
###212 thing was going out, he had numerous phone calls from
###217 other sponsors that wanted to hook him up.
###220 Out of all the thing when the Rasa Libre thing went-- he was
###223 like, there was Omar, there was Reese, there was all those
###225 guys I was dealing with.
###227 But Dylan was by far the most that everyone was wanting.
###231 Everyone was calling, going, all right,
###233 what's up with Dylan?
###234 GREG HUNT: People were saying that he kind of wanted to
###236 maybe ride for Anti Hero, but he wasn't sure.
###239 Because he was through Deluxe, too.
###241 He'd been talking to those guys, maybe.
###243 MARK OBLOW: Yeah, obviously he had to get
###247 voted on to both companies.
###249 I don't think he was voted on completely with Anti Hero.
###253 I knew he definitely looked up to those dudes.
###256 DYLAN RIEDER: They asked me to ride for Anti Hero.
###260 Which I was super psyched on.
###261 Then I talked to Jim.
###263 And he wanted me to ride for him.
###264 And I remember thinking, fuck, I don't really fit the roster
###267 for Anti Hero.
###268 I'm not a super gnarly pool skater.
###272 Because at that time, there wasn't any Vans on the team, I
###276 don't think.
###276 It was just Tony and Stranger and Hewitt and stuff.
###281 I went on an Anti Hero Vans trip, but I didn't really get
###286 along with one of the riders.
###287 So I told Stranger I was over it.
###291 [LAUGHTER]
###294 INTERVIEWER: Do you want to tell me who it was?
###296 DYLAN RIEDER: No.
###296 Not really.
###297 I probably shouldn't even have brought that up.
###300 At the same time as well, AVE had asked
###303 me to ride for Workshop.
###304 So that was a big factor in it as well.
###307 I don't know.
###307 I just felt that Workshop was kind of more my steez.
###313 And fucking AVE and Dill and Heath
###316 were my favorite skaters.
###319 So I was like, fuck, I want to ride for the company with all
###322 the dudes I look up to.
###323 Not too many kids get to say they ride for their favorite
###325 company with their favorite skaters.
###327 GREG HUNT: He got on right before that TransWorld video
###329 part came out that he was in.
###331 And he just seemed like he really fit, especially with
###334 where Workshop was at the time.
###336 They were talking about starting to do a video.
###339 And at the time there weren't a lot of young guys-- like new
###342 ams on the team.
###344 
###346 HEATH KIRCHART: I mean, Greg was the main
###348 motivation behind that.
###349 He was really psyched on Dylan.
###351 It was all Greg trying to--
###353 because Greg was working on "Mind Field."
###355 And at the time, he was like, well, the video needs these
###357 younger kids, and stuff.
###358 And I agreed with it, and everything.
###359 And it did.
###360 And so Greg was the main motivation to
###362 make the video better.
###364 
###368 ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: We were starting the workshop video.
###370 I was living with Greg.
###372 It was 2000 fucking 6, or the end of 5, I think.
###377 And I think we were kind of riding out that lull of when
###382 Pappalardo had originally quit.
###384 It was a slow start.
###385 And there was no real new blood on the team.
###389 And we knew we needed that in the video and just for the
###393 Workshop in general.
###395 I remember talking to Greg.
###396 And I was like, dude, this kid--
###400 Omar and Dylan being a ideal package.
###405 We were talking about both of them at the same time.
###409 We needed to kind of jump on these kids, you know?
###411
