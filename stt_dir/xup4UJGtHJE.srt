1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:12,51



2
0:0:12,51 --> 0:0:15,7
I think the best party I've ever
been to is a party that I


3
0:0:15,7 --> 0:0:21,22
had that happened just by
chance, and it was probably


4
0:0:21,22 --> 0:0:22,85
the luckiest day of my life.


5
0:0:22,85 --> 0:0:26,2
I get a call from the head of
Victoria's Secret, and he


6
0:0:26,2 --> 0:0:29,6
says, "We've never had a party
in Los Angeles, and we'd like


7
0:0:29,6 --> 0:0:32,94
you to host a party for
Victoria's Secret at your


8
0:0:32,94 --> 0:0:33,39
home."


9
0:0:33,39 --> 0:0:35,74
And I said, "Well, what do you
mean by that?" And he goes,


10
0:0:35,74 --> 0:0:38,99
"We will bring 25 supermodels
to your home, Victoria's


11
0:0:38,99 --> 0:0:40,94
Secret models." I said, "Are
you joking?" He said, "No,


12
0:0:40,94 --> 0:0:41,52
we're serious."


13
0:0:41,52 --> 0:0:44,18
I go, "Who can I invite?" He
goes, "Whoever you want." I


14
0:0:44,18 --> 0:0:46,44
said, "Well, I'm not inviting
many people." And I literally,


15
0:0:46,44 --> 0:1:0,22
I think, invited 10 guys.


16
0:1:0,22 --> 0:1:3,5
I have a disco in my house that
was built in the '70s.


17
0:1:3,5 --> 0:1:8,57
25 supermodels and 10
guys in my house.


18
0:1:8,57 --> 0:1:17,45



19
0:1:17,45 --> 0:1:22,29
Three of the 10 guys ended up
marrying three of the girls.


20
0:1:22,29 --> 0:1:25,45
Adriana Lima married the
basketball player.


21
0:1:25,45 --> 0:1:27,91
Charlie Sheen happened to marry
the one girl that wasn't


22
0:1:27,91 --> 0:1:29,75
a Victoria's Secret model--
happened to come with my


23
0:1:29,75 --> 0:1:30,38
ex-girlfriend.


24
0:1:30,38 --> 0:1:33,45
And the third girl, Orlando
Bloom married.


25
0:1:33,45 --> 0:1:36,797
Three people at one party--
and there was only 10 guys


26
0:1:36,797 --> 0:1:37,57
there, and 25 girls.


27
0:1:37,57 --> 0:1:38,67
That has never happened.


28
0:1:38,67 --> 0:1:40,25
It was the best party
I've ever been to.


29
0:1:40,25 --> 0:3:40,25
