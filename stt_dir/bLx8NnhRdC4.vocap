###18 [music]
###36 Welcome! To this episode of Genesis Week, the
###39 weekly program of creationary commentary on news,
###42 views and events pertaining to the origins
###44 controversy, made possible by the supporters of
###46 CORE Ottawa, Citizens for Origins Research and
###48 Education, and now carried on the Christianima
###51 network - christianima.com - Christian cinema at
###54 its finest. Excellence in pirate broadcasting, we
###57 took over my best friend's garage for our studio
###60 today so we could continue to bring you the
###62 information the anticreationists don't want you to
###64 see or hear, and giving glory to our Creator while
###67 doing it. The Bible does NOT say "Put on therefore,
###71 as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
###74 mercies, kindness, numbness of mind..." No! God
###79 gave you a brain, we here at Genesis Week presume
###82 it's because He wants you to use it! Remember if
###85 you get lost in cyberspace, you can just punch in
###87 wazooloo.com or genesisweek.com and you can find
###90 us, and also subscribe to our youtube channel to
###92 get extras like CrEvo rants and full interviews
###95 with our guests. I'm your host, Ian Juby.
###98 You'll recall a few episodes back I discussed a
###102 NATURE interview with Dr. Steven Benner who
###105 described DNA as a "Stupid design." Well nature had
###110 a couple of papers out this past week on the
###112 marvels of DNA and its design. The first one was
###115 from researchers at the Max Planck Institute of
###119 Biochemistry who detailed a ring-like protein which
###121 holds the DNA into its compact bundles. Now at
###127 first, you may say "Who cares?" But you need to
###131 understand the significance of this bundling. Your
###135 DNA would be about 2 meters long, yet it is so
###140 tightly and carefully wound up that it fits into
###143 chromosomes only 1 or 2 MILLIONTHS of a meter. If
###149 you took all of the DNA in your body, unwound all
###153 the strands and laid them end to end, they could go
###157 to the moon and back over 100,000 times. And yet,
###164 the complex bundling and packaging system is so
###168 efficient, that all the DNA in your body can fit
###172 in a teaspoon.
###175 Anyone who has ever packaged the good old string of
###178 christmas lights knows the importance of packaging
###181 the light strings properly, or - it costs you an
###184 incredible amount of work. So now compare your DNA
###188 to a string of christmas lights thousands of miles
###193 long, and you can quickly see the importance of
###196 keeping it very carefully bundled when it's not in
###200 use! This is why there are all of these complex
###205 bundling systems involved with the DNA. There are
###209 molecular machines who very carefully and
###213 meticulously bundle the DNA. Guess where the plans
###218 for those machines comes from? You guessed it
###222 - the DNA.
###223 When it comes to DNA, life is on the line. While
###228 you need to have all these systems for keeping DNA
###231 controlled and tightly wound up, cell division must
###235 take place. So the DNA must be unwound, a second
###241 copy made, and the copies properly and evenly
###245 distributed to the two cells dividing off. That's
###250 where these ring proteins come in. These are only
###254 ONE of many, many required complex tools and parts
###258 for handling the very important DNA. So which came
###264 first: The rings which hold the DNA together, or
###268 the DNA which contains the plans for the rings
###272 which are needed to hold the DNA together? Or the
###276 machines which read the DNA and make the rings? Or
###281 the machines which install the rings, very
###284 carefully and methodically wind and unwind the DNA?
###289 The plans for those machines come from the DNA, but
###292 still yet other machines make those machines, based
###296 on plans from the DNA. The plans for ALL of these
###301 machines comes from the DNA - including the
###304 machines that make the DNA. So which one came
###309 first? It's a nonsense question to ask which came
###313 first, because the correct answer is they all came
###317 about at the same time! Like any factory, these
###321 different systems were DESIGNED. What an incredible
###326 designer - our best minds and technology cannot
###331 produce even crude renditions of these system. All
###336 of our best minds - all of our most incredible
###339 intelligence pales in comparison to the astonishing
###343 intelligence and design that went into DNA and the
###347 machines that read it. Our Creator is truly
###351 an awesome God!
###354 But wait - wait - DNA was supposed to be a stupid
###357 design right? Not according the researchers
###360 attempting to use DNA in place of hard drive
###363 storage! Publishing their paper in the journal -
###366 NATURE, Goldman et al., used synthetic DNA as a
###371 man-made digital storage medium - using DNA instead
###377 of a hard drive, CD ROM, or flash stick.
###380 Effectively, that is what your DNA is - think of it
###384 like the hard drives that store the program on how
###388 to build you.
###390 So Goldman et al took that concept and ran with it:
###395 they made a strand of DNA which contained digitally
###399 encoded files: They recorded all of Shakespeare's
###403 sonnets, a PDF copy of Watson and Crick's original
###408 paper describing the structure of DNA, a JPG
###412 photograph of the research institute that produced
###414 the synthetic DNA, a 26 second MP3 of Martin Luther
###420 King's "I have a dream" speech, and the code that
###425 was used to convert all of those digital files into
###428 a DNA sequence! All of this was recorded onto what
###433 can only be described as a speck of dust, which the
###437 researchers are confident can be stored in cool,
###440 dry locations, preserving the digital data for tens
###444 of thousands of years!
###447 This truly is some marvelous engineering on their
###451 part, but obviously DNA is not a stupid design,
###455 seeing as how the researchers went to great lengths
###458 extoling the benefits of digital storage on DNA,
###463 and its reliability.
###465 What's even more remarkable is when you look at how
###469 DNA is actually used in biology, as it relates to
###473 digital storage. For example, imagine reading
###478 information off of your hard drive. You start at
###481 sector 1 and read your file. If your hard drive was
###486 written like DNA is, you could also start in the
###489 middle of sector 1, read through until the middle
###493 of sector 2, and get OTHER information - that's
###497 right, completely different information is
###500 superimposed on the letters on the hard drive of
###505 sector 1. It would be like having this line of
###510 instructions being the first three steps of
###514 assembling a machine:
###516 Our first two instructions actually overlap and are
###521 superimposed upon each other. You can decipher the
###524 instructions if you know where to start and stop:
###539 So you provide more instructions with fewer letters
###545 - your instructions take LESS SPACE. And that is
###551 how the DNA is written. A lot of imformation is
###554 actually superimposed upon other strings of letters
###558 in the DNA!
###560 As has now been discovered, other portions of the
###562 DNA direct the reading of other portions of the DNA
###567 so that, in our example sentence, we can extract a
###571 third step in the assembly instructions. The
###575 numbers on the end dictate how to extract the third
###579 assembly instruction from seemingly random places
###583 in the original information, by telling us to
###587 collect the specific words by their position
###590 in the string:
###599 Yet in the DNA, that extra directing information -
###604 those seemingly meaningless numbers, make up some
###608 98% of your DNA! It was called "junk DNA" because
###614 it didn't seem to do anything directly! We are only
###618 now beginning to unravel how the "junk DNA" is used
###622 - and it's mind bogglingly complex!
###626 Our best computer programmers on earth would be
###630 hard pressed to write programs with overlapping
###633 lines of code, other sections of code which direct
###638 how to retrieve more instructions from random
###642 locations in the overall code, etc... and if a
###646 computer programmer did such a thing, we'd call
###649 them a genius. We certainly wouldn't say their code
###653 was a stupid design - unless we were ignorant of
###657 what they were doing.
###660 So here we see Goldman et. al. using DNA to do
###667 exactly what it does in nature: Communicate and
###671 transmit information. No one is suggesting that
###675 this man-made DNA happened by unguided processes.
###679 Everyone is acknowledging it was intelligently
###682 assembled. So why is it then that some would
###685 suggest that OUR DNA was NOT intelligently
###688 assembled? I'll tell you why - philosophical
###692 reasons only. No one has ever seen DNA assemble
###696 itself and compile information out of nothingness.
###701 Information has only ever been observed to come
###704 from information. That's a scientific fact. In fact
###708 I would dare say that DNA has only ever been
###712 observed to arise from DNA! Think about it.
###715 Intelligence has only ever been observed to come
###719 from intelligence, therefore the intelligence that
###723 went into the incredible design of our DNA is the
###727 ultimate in intelligence, because after decades of
###731 mind-bogglingly complex research and study, we
###736 STILL haven't found out the entirety of how our
###740 computer program, our DNA, is used.
###744 That ultimate intelligence is, I would suggest,
###747 Christ Jesus, our Creator. His incredible
###751 intelligence in baffling the pharisees, saducees
###754 and those attempting to trap him in His words, that
###758 intelligence He showed was only a scratch on the
###762 surface of his ultimate intelligence.
###766 Speaking of alleged "junk DNA" - ERV's were in the
###771 news again this past week. Researchers from the
###774 University of Massachusetts published a paper in
###777 the journal Retrovirology, showing that an ERV
###780 played a role in the production of our stem cells.
###784 Stem cells are found in various places throughout
###787 the body and are crucial to development, as stem
###792 cells can turn into pretty much any cell that your
###795 body needs. The researchers claimed this ERV was
###799 "millions of years old," and notice what the
###802 researchers said in their interview with
###804 ScienceDaily:
###823 I know, I know what you're thinking - Come on Ian -
###826 what on earth is an ERV? To help us understand this
###830 technical subject, Dr. Jean Lightner has joined me
###832 via skype. Dr. Lightner obtained her bachelor's
###837 degree in agriculture, earned a masters and DVM in
###840 Veterinarian medicine, all from Ohio State
###843 University. She is an excellent communicator and
###846 I'm thrilled to have her join me today  welcome
###848 to the show Dr. Lightner.
###849 >>Why thank you Ian
###851 >>So let's start off with that question  - just
###853 what is an ERV and how does it relate to
###858 the creation/evolution debate?
###860 >>An ERV is an endogenous retrovirus. In order to
###864 understand what that is, we should probably talk
###867 about what a retrovirus is. There are several
###869 different kinds of viruses, all pretty much contain
###872 a protein outside, a coat, and inside they have a
###875 nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA.
###877 >>RNA is one half of the DNA ladder.
###882 >>Essentially. Retroviruses have RNA on the inside.
###885 When they infect a cell the RNA is injected into
###890 the host cell. Then it does something very
###892 interesting. Usually we think of DNA being
###895 transcribed into RNA which is translated into
###900 proteins. However, with the RNA from the
###902 retrovirus, it does something kind of backwards.
###906 The RNA is used as a template to make new DNA that
###909 then becomes part of the host DNA. This is reverse
###912 transcription, which is where the retro term comes
###916 from. So a retrovirus is something outside a cell
###919 which infects a cell. The RNA is reverse
###922 transcribed back into DNA. Then when the host
###926 transcribes its own DNA it will copy the virus DNA
###929 as well. Then it will make new viruses. Then you
###932 will have a whole bunch of new viruses to go and
###934 infect other cells.
###936 There are some specific features of a retrovirus
###939 sequence that help us to identify it. For example
###942 on either end are long terminal repeats (LTRs).
###945 This is repetitive DNA. In between are several
###948 specific genes. When we started looking at sequence
###952 data from the DNA of various creatures, such as
###955 humans or animals, we found patterns that looked
###958 like the result of retrovirus infections. However,
###962 these sequences are part of the DNA that is passed
###964 down from parent to offspring. It is these
###967 sequences which are called endogenous retroviruses
###972 (ERVs).
###973 >>OK. So can you briefly clarify how we know the
###977 difference between a retrovirus and endogenous
###981 retrovirus (ERV)?
###983 >>With a regular retroviral infection, some of the
###986 cells in the body are infected, but these cells do
###988 not pass information on to the offspring. With an
###992 endogenous retroviral sequence, it appears similar
###995 to a retroviral sequence but it is found in all
###998 cells of the body and is passed on to the
###1001 offspring. Many of these sequences have patterns in
###1004 them that look like damage from an ancient
###1007 infection because they do not code for all the
###1010 necessary components to make an active virus. Often
###1014 there are many copies of them, which makes it look
###1016 like they have spread in the DNA in the past.
###1019 >>So how does it relate to
###1022 the creation/evolution debate?
###1024 >>If we assume that these ERV sequences are really
###1028 from a past infection in the germ line and if we
###1031 assume that the retroviral sequences are inserted
###1034 essentially randomly, then when we find an ERV
###1038 sequence that is very similar in the same position
###1041 in two different animals it would make sense that
###1043 this came from an infection that happened in one
###1046 of their ancestors.
###1049 So evolutionists were really excited when they
###1051 found out that humans and other primates share
###1054 similar ERV sequences in the same position. To them
###1058 that was proof that humans and other primate had to
###1061 share a common ancestor. It seemed they were best
###1065 explained as an infection in a common ancestor.
###1069 >>Now I like the way Dr. Joseph Mastropaolo put it:
###1071 I mean typically a virus infects a specific type of
###1076 cell or area in the DNA, so you and I getting the
###1080 same flu does not make us relatives
###1084 >>True enough. And that is a good point, perhaps
###1086 those sequences got there independently in
###1089 humans and primates.
###1091 >>What are some of the problems with this thinking
###1094 that ERV's are, in fact,
###1097 evidence of viral infection and more importantly,
###1101 evidence of evolution?
###1103 >>As I mentioned, ERVs were believed to be junk
###1106 DNA. If ERVs were left over from an ancient viral
###1110 infection, they certainly wouldn’t be expected to
###1113 carry out important functions.
###1116 The problem is that more recent research has shown
###1119 that these portions of DNA are transcribed at
###1122 specific times in specific tissues. They appear to
###1126 be important in a number of different ways.
###1130 There is an excellent creationist article
###1133 highlighting this. In 2009 Dr. Liu and Dr. Soper
###1136 published an interesting article in the Answers
###1138 Research Journal entitled: The Natural History of
###1142 Retroviruses: Exogenization vs Endogenization. In
###1148 it, they cite research documenting ERVs directly
###1152 coding for proteins, and others associated with
###1155 gene regulation, DNA repair and recombination, and
###1158 transduction (making copies onto RNA and then
###1162 reverse transcribing them somewhere else in
###1167 the DNA).
###1170 Basically, they hypothesize that things actually
###1174 went the other direction. Retroviruses appeared
###1177 when these mobile elements within the
###1180 genome escaped.
###1183 >>So in other words ERV's weren't caused by virus
###1188 genes, but rather virus genes came from ERV's?
###1194 >>It appears so. One of the biggest problems for
###1198 the earlier claims that these are evidence for
###1202 evolution is that ERVs have been shown to have
###1204 essential roles in reproduction and development.
###1207 So how did the primate ancestor reproduce while it
###1211 was waiting for the germline retroviral infection?
###1214 >>Ya  like it brings whole new meaning to
###1216 “Honey, I don't have a headache.” This is a
###1219 critical point  this is the reproductive system.
###1223 So effectively, without this alleged ERV, no
###1228 reproduction, therefore, extinction of the species.
###1232 >>It would seem so. Instead of these sequences
###1236 being the result of an ancient infection, it seems
###1239 more logical that they were created for a purpose.
###1242 The article by Liu and Soper make a good
###1244 case for this.
###1246 I mentioned earlier two assumptions. The first is
###1249 that these sequences were the result of germline
###1252 infections in the distant past. We have just
###1254 discussed why this may not be the case. The second
###1258 is that they insert essentially randomly. A more
###1262 recent article by Santoni et al. challenges this.
###1267 Not only did they find a human ERV associated with
###1270 an essential part of development, but they also
###1273 found that the placement of these sequences were
###1276 associated with certain epigenetic markers.
###1279 >>For the sake of the viewers, if I may interrupt,
###1283 epigenetics is sort of the controlling of genes
###1289 with other genetic “switches,” which are called
###1294 epigenetic markers. So just think of epigenetic
###1297 markers as switches that turn on or off certain
###1302 portions of the DNA. Sorry Jean - I just had to
###1305 throw something in to make myself look smart. Carry
###1309 on with what you were saying. {laughing}
###1311 >>In this case the epigenetic marker was a specific
###1314 histone. Histones are special proteins the DNA is
###1319 wrapped around that affect how exposed the section
###1322 of DNA is so it can be translated. So the Santoni
###1327 et al paper indicates that this type of ERV in
###1333 humans is less randomly arranged than
###1336 we had thought.
###1338 Sometimes the word random can just mean we don’t
###1340 understand yet why the pattern is there.
###1342 Now there are times where ERVs are associated with
###1345 disease. In fact, we often discover the problems
###1348 associated with something before we really
###1350 understand the importance of that something. This
###1353 was true of bacteria. Because they were found to be
###1358 associated with disease, many had assumed they were
###1361 always bad. It turns out this is not the case. Most
###1364 are not harmful. In fact many are essential for
###1368 life on earth. It looks like the same may be true
###1372 of ERVs and other mobile genetic elements.
###1376 >>Well that is fascinating Dr. Lightner, I really

###1478 population problem, YouTuber Kiwifrogg wrote in:
###1508 Thanks for writing in! Several people brought up
###1511 similar points, but you need to remember several
###1513 things: First of all, cremation is a modern
###1517 phenomena. Secondly, as I mentioned briefly,
###1520 Neanderthal graves have been found, complete with
###1523 burial artifacts - so it's not a western ideal to
###1526 bury a single plot with grave artifacts. Lastly,
###1529 you also need to remember the astronomical numbers
###1533 of bodies we're talking about here - I was
###1535 exceedingly conservative for the sake of argument,
###1538 and as several viewers pointed out, I still only
###1541 dealt with 200,000 years of people, not the two
###1545 MILLION years of alleged human ancestors right
###1548 through to Homo Habilis and the like. Besides
###1551 which, none of that was my main point: to assume
###1555 deep time and explain away the missing bodies is
###1558 arguing from absence of evidence.
