0:0:1,51 --> 0:0:4,54
Okay.
Are you from the <i>Star Wars</i> universe?


2
0:0:4,54 --> 0:0:5,255
Yes.


3
0:0:5,255 --> 0:0:7,791
- Were you in the original trilogy?
- Yes.


4
0:0:7,791 --> 0:0:13,129
Is there a picture of you in my wallet
wearing a metal bikini?


5
0:0:13,129 --> 0:0:15,398
God, I hope not.


6
0:0:15,398 --> 0:0:19,235
- No, I'm not Princess Leia.
- Okay, my turn.


7
0:0:19,235 --> 0:0:21,571
Are you in all six <i>Star Wars</i> movies?


8
0:0:21,571 --> 0:0:23,173
- Yes.
- Interesting.


9
0:0:23,173 --> 0:0:25,608
- Are you a droid?
- Yes.


10
0:0:25,608 --> 0:0:29,946
Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?


11
0:0:29,946 --> 0:0:32,48
Yes.


12
0:0:32,48 --> 0:0:35,351
- C-3P0.
- You got it.


13
0:0:35,351 --> 0:0:39,189
That's preposterous.
I do not resemble C-3P0.


14
0:0:39,189 --> 0:0:43,893
Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered,
I just don't see it.


15
0:0:43,893 --> 0:0:47,764
[CELL PHONE RINGING]


16
0:0:47,764 --> 0:0:49,666
Leslie Winkle. Ahem.


17
0:0:49,666 --> 0:0:53,69
You've reached Friends with Benefits.


18
0:0:53,69 --> 0:0:58,508
For a booty call, press 1 now.


19
0:0:58,508 --> 0:1:2,78
What exactly does that expression mean,
"friends with benefits"?


20
0:1:2,78 --> 0:1:5,782
Does he provide her
with health insurance?


21
0:1:5,782 --> 0:1:7,25
No.


22
0:1:7,25 --> 0:1:11,154
Look, imagine you maintained a friendship
with someone you had sex with...


23
0:1:11,154 --> 0:1:14,991
...but you were free to date
whoever you wanted.


24
0:1:14,991 --> 0:1:18,728
I'm sorry, I can't imagine any of that.


25
0:1:18,728 --> 0:1:20,53
All right, back to the game.


26
0:1:20,53 --> 0:1:21,898
I believe it's my turn.


27
0:1:21,898 --> 0:1:24,3
You may begin your questions
whenever you're ready.


28
0:1:24,3 --> 0:1:30,106
Are you Spock?


29
0:1:30,106 --> 0:3:30,106
I don't like this game.
