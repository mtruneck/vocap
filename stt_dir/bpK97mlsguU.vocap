###2 - Honey, remember, you have to make dinner tomorrow night,
###5 Because I have to go to Kevin's school for that meeting.
###7 - You do? Why?
###9 - Because your tests came back
###10 And they need to discuss your mental challenges.
###12 - I have to go to a fund-raiser meeting.
###15 Why do you think I have to go?
###16 - Fund-raiser meeting?
###18 - Mm-Hmm.
###20 I can't stand these stupid meetings.
###22 And those women get on my nerves.
###24 - How come?
###25 - Because all they do is nitpick and gossip
###28 And criticize.
###29 And every time I go to one of these things,
###31 Somehow I end up running another event.
###34 And then all they do is sit around and say no
###36 To everything I suggest.
###38 And then they wait till the last minute
###40 And look at me like I'm crazy.
###41 Well, I'll tell you what.
###43 They're gonna have to find another fool.
###44 - I'll tell you what.
###45 Why don't I go with you?
###47 - You don't have to do that.
###48 - Well, yes, I do.
###49 I've seen you mad.
###50 I'm not gonna let you run around that room
###52 Snatching off wigs and weaves "Ahh, Ahh!"
###55 Screaming at the top of your voice,
###56 And running up on the roof, talking about,
###58 "you'll never take me alive!"
###59 And then the police have to surround the place
###61 With guns and megaphones.
###63 And then they arrest you.
###64 And then I end up a single father.
###66 That's not why I got married.
###67 - Aw, honey.
###69 That's very nice.
###71 What about the kids?
###72 Do you think we need a sitter?
###74 - No.
###75 By the time I was 15,
###76 My mother was leaving me alone with food, keys, bus fare,
###78 And a couple of blank post-dated checks
###80 Just in case something came up.
###81 - All right, Lindsey.
###83 You can handle things around here.
###84 But if you want to get paid,
###85 You're actually gonna have to watch your brother.
###87 - Why would you pay her to watch me
###89 When you can cut a deal with me to watch myself for free?
###92 - Because we don't negotiate with terrorists.

###109 - Okay, guys, we'll see you about 10:00 P.M.
###111 - Nick!
###112 - What?
###117 You're not supposed to tell them
###118 What time we're actually coming back.
###120 You're supposed to tell them an hour later.
###121 This way, when we come home early,
###123 We can catch them in the act.
###125 - In the act of what?
###126 - Whatever they were doing
###128 When they thought we weren't coming home for an hour.
###130 - Ooh, that's a good idea.
###132 - Okay.
###134 - Actually, guys, we'll see you about 11:00.
###136 - 11:00?
###137 Got it.
###138 - Kevin. - I know, I know.
###140 Behave, clean up the dishes,
###142 Do my homework, and don't set Lindsey on fire.
###146 - Bye. - Bye, guys.
###148 - Bye. - Bye.
###153 - Okay, so here's the deal.
###155 I'm going over to Kelly's,
###156 And I'll be back in about an hour.
###158 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
###159 What about my dinner?
###162 Here's ten bucks.
###163 Go to up-and-down burger. It's just a few blocks.
###165 - Whoa, whoa, hey. Make it $20.
###166 $10 for the burger and $10 for my sides.
###169 - How much to make you shut up forever?
###171 - Leave and never come back.
###172 - Never gonna happen, bro.
###174 Nice try.
###178 - Okay, take your seats, people.
###180 We're back, we're back, we're back.
###181 Okay, people.
###182 As you know, we are here tonight
###184 To discuss the annual baby got buck dinner.
###188 - My idea. Said they hated it.
###192 It was a great idea, so thank you.
###195 It was a huge success last year.
###197 We were able to get books
###198 For the entire fourth grade class.
###202 - It was a great idea, baby.
###204 - As you know, we are going to need a volunteer chair person.
###208 - What they need is a volunteer sucka.
###211 Ain't gonna be me.
###213 - Okay, I do understand.
###214 It takes a lot of time.
###216 But when you see those kids coming in to school
###218 Knowing how much work their parents are doing for them,
###222 It is always worth it.
###225 - Not to me. - Mm-mm.
###227 - Okay, so I see nobody wants to volunteer.
###230 - That's 'cause nobody is stupid.
###232 - I have a suggestion.
###233 - She got a suggestion.
###234 - Since last year's event
###235 Was such a huge success...
###237 - Because of me.
###238 - I nominate Suzanne Kingston-persons.
###243 - What?
###246 - Suzanne, would you?
###250 - Of course I would.
###252 Yay!
###253 - You would?
###255 - Yay, yeah!
###259 - Man, I'll be glad when I can babysit myself.
###262 Then I won't have to deal with my stupid sister.
###264 - Don't take it for granted.
###265 Sometimes I wish I had a stupid sister who hated me
###268 And left me to fend for myself.
###269 You got it good, man.
###275 Aw, man, nothing.
###276 - Yeah, that's usually what that sound means.
###279 - No, I mean I didn't win the prize.
###281 These are big bonus cups.
###283 When you finish your drink,
###284 The cup reveals a prize at the bottom.
###286 Finish yours and see if you won.
###287 - Oh, okay.
###292 Oh, oh, brain freeze. Brain freeze.
###294 Ah, ah, I hate those!
###296 - Dude, you won.
###298 - Dude, quit lying!
###300 Let me see that.
###303 $500?
###305 Wait, wait, wait.
###306 $500?
###307 $500...
###308 Five... what?
###309 Hit it!
###317 - Kevin, you know you're not supposed to have people over.
###319 - Oh, well, I would like to thank you
###321 For leaving me home alone,
###323 Because now I have $500.
###325 What?
###326 - How?
###331 I can't believe this.
###332 - I know.
###333 I can't wait to tell mom and dad.
###334 - No, you can't.
###336 - Why not? - Allow me.
###338 You can't tell your parents,
###339 Because you weren't supposed
###340 To be out of the house.
###341 If you show them the cup,
###343 They'll know you went out.
###345 That's okay.
###346 I won't tell them.
###347 I'll just go get my money.
###348 - Yeah. - Yeah!
###350 - Nope, you can't do that either.
###352 - Why?
###353 - It says right here in order to claim the prize
###355 You have to be at least 18 or older.
###357 - So how are we supposed to cash the cup in?
###361 - Do you trust me?
###362 - No.
###363 - Let me rephrase that.
###364 Do you want your money?
###365 - Yeah.
###366 - Then you're gonna have to trust me.
###374 - Ha ha!
###375 You didn't think we'd be back so early, did you?
###378 - Actually, we did.
###379 Mom always comes home an hour early from meetings.
###382 - Then how come you guys are sitting on the couch
###384 Watching tv, eating popcorn?
###388 - Because we wanted popcorn?
###390 - Come on.
###391 Watch your tone.
###393 - Now go to bed.
###394 And next time, don't y'all be trying to outsmart people.
###398 - You're right.
###399 I don't know what we were thinking.
###403 - Can't believe I'm in charge of this committee again.
###407 - Baby, all you had to say was "no."
###409 - How do I look standing there saying "no"
###411 In a room full of people who are clapping for me,
###414 Including my husband?
###415 - You look like someone who doesn't want to do it.
###418 - Fine, make fun of me.
###420 - Baby, let me help you with this.
###422 - What are you gonna do?
###423 Go back in your time machine
###424 And not clap when they pick me?
###426 - No, I was thinking I could do it.
###432 You're kidding, right?
###433 Those women are a nightmare.
###436 They will suck you in, set you up, and spit you out.
###438 - It can't be no worse than what your kids try to do to me.
###442 Hey, I played football.
###445 I ran a business.
###446 I ain't scared of no moms and a fund-raiser. Shoot.
###450 - Okay, homey.
###452 But don't come crying back to me
###453 When you get played like a boy band.
###456 Yeah!
###458 - I don't do it like that.
###460 I don't do it like that.
###461 You got to have the swagger.
###463 - So what happened with Suzanne?
###464 Is she okay? - Oh, she's fine.
###466 She just didn't realize how swamped she was with work
###468 Before you asked her to chair the event again.
###470 - Oh, well, if you are anything at all like her,
###472 I imagine we are in excellent hands.
###475 - Okay, you guys ready to get to work?
###476 - I just want to say, what you're doing is fantastic.
###479 It's nice to see a dad step up for a change.
###481 - And it's good to break up
###483 Some of the female energy.
###484 - Kind of like a security guard at a shoe sale.
###490 - Tell me, Nick.
###492 How did Suzanne convince you
###494 To come down here in her place?
###496 - Well, she didn't. I volunteered.
###498 Oh!
###500 - That's amazing.
###501 I can barely get my husband to read a report card.
###504 - Send it to ESPN.
###505 Have them put it on the ticker.
###511 - My husband doesn't even know where the children go to school.
###515 - Let me tell you something, honey.
###516 Take the tv remote. Put it in heir backpacks.
###518 He'll find 'em.
###522 - Can we not talk about husbands?
###524 The only reason I don't kill mine is because I am too lazy
###526 To row his dead body out to sea and dump it.
###529 - Is that why Suzanne keeps trying
###531 To get me to go on that cruise?
###534 I finally figured that out.
###538 You know what?
###539 I just have to be honest with you guys.
###540 Suzanne said you would be rough on me,
###543 But, you know, you're all right.
###544 - Now, why would she say something like that?
###547 - We love her.
###548 - If anything, she's kind of tough on us.
###549 - I know what you mean.
###550 Suzanne does not play.
###554 - You know what?
###555 - We do.
###556 - Ooh, Carol!
###557 - Drinks, anyone?
###558 - Carol, what are you doing?
###560 Oh, my goodness.
###561 Pta stands for "pass the alcohol."
###568 - So let me see if I've got this right.
###569 You're gonna take the cup and give it to your friend Eric.
###572 - Eric, right. - And he's gonna take it
###573 To the place and cash it in.
###574 - Right, then he takes 20 bucks, and gives the rest to us.
###577 - You mean me.
###578 - No, us.
###579 You need me to cash it in, so it's us.
###582 - But it's my cup.
###583 I bought it
###584 When you left me in the house by myself.
###587 - Which I'm prepared to tell mom and dad
###589 If you don't share your money with me.
###591 - So you would tell mom and dad that you left me alone
###595 Just so I don't get the money,
###596 Even though you know you'd get in trouble?
###598 - Yeah, they'll forgive me.
###600 - You just took evil to a whole new level.
###606 - Hey.
###607 I thought you had a school thing this afternoon.
###609 - I sent Nick in my place.
###611 - Why would you send Nick down there?
###613 You hate those women.
###614 They hate me.
###615 And I was ambushed.
###616 We have another fund-raiser,
###618 And they nominated me to be chairperson.
###620 - Fund-raising is easy.
###621 You put on a nice dress, find a man of means,
###624 And tell him what he has to pay for.
###625 - That may work with a trip to Vegas,
###628 But you can't use that on your kids.
###630 - Okay.
###632 So Nick is there.
###634 - Mm-Hmm.
###636 - Hmm.
###637 - "Hmm" what?
###638 - I just, you know, okay.
###640 I don't want to overstep my boundaries,
###641 But I have a question for you. - What?
###643 - Are you crazy?
###645 These women hate you,
###646 Which means they can't be trusted around your husband.
###649 - I'm not worried about Nick.
###650 - Well, you should be, because you and I both know
###653 Men are stupid.
###654 - Nick is not stupid.
###656 - I love you. Yes, he is.
###657 - Gigi!
###659 - I'm sorry, but you throw a man
###660 In a room with a bunch of women,
###662 He can't help but try to be liked,
###664 Even by women who hate you.
###666 And they know that.
###668 - You're overreacting.
###669 And trust me.
###670 I can handle my man.
###672 And the good news is, after a hard day's work here,
###675 I don't have to see them.
###689 - Ow, ow!
###695 - Hey, everybody!
###696 - Hey, baby!
###698 Hi, Suzanne.
###700 - Hi!
###701 hi.
###705 - Wow!
###706 Nick, you didn't tell me all the ladies were coming by.
###711 - Well, it just kind of happened.
###712 Pop!
###714 - You know, we ran over our time at the school,
###715 But we were on such a role,
###717 I said, "let's just go to their house.
###720 And you have a lovely home.
###721 - Mm-Hmm.
###723 - And Nick is so great.
###724 He said it would be no problem.
###727 - He did?
###728 Mm-Hmm.
###729 - Your husband is quite
###730 The idea man, Suzanne
###731 We love having him on the committee.
###733 - Adore.
###734 - Is that so?
###736 - We are already moving so much faster than last year.
###739 - Oh, it's amazing.
###740 - Your husband is such a doll.
###741 - Oh, he is, isn't he?
###746 Nick, can I show you something I brought home from work?
###748 - Oh, can it wait?
###749 We're almost done here.
###750 - Not really.
###752 It kind of has something to do with your health.
###757 - Okay, well,
###759 Keep it moving.
###760 Bend it; don't break it.
###761 We'll be right back.
###768 - Nick, you know I can't stand those women.
###770 Why would you have them here?
###772 - We got caught up.
###773 - I mean, everyone has something going on at their houses.
###776 - They were lying.
###777 They're just trying to get in our business.
###778 I can't believe you fell for that.
###780 - Fell for what?
###782 You're being paranoid.
###784 Those ladies are out there trying to figure out a way
###786 To make money for the kids.
###787 You said they were gossips,
###788 But they haven't said anything but nice things about you.
###791 They love my ideas,
###793 And you know, this might be shocking,
###795 But I think they're quite nice.
###797 - The only reason they're being nice to you
###800 Is so that they can get at me.
###802 - Is it possible that they could just like me?
###804 - No!
###806 Because they know that I don't like them.
###807 And they know that if they're nice to you,
###809 You're gonna come back and tell me how nice they are.
###811 And it's gonna get under my skin like it is right now.
###813 - You guys almost finished? - Aw, yes, Melissa.
###816 Nick will be right back out. Thanks so much.
###818 - I was just telling the ladies it's so nice
###820 That Nick is such a great husband,
###821 Especially since you work
###823 And can't be with your kids like you want to.
###825 - It is.
###826 I'm blessed.
###827 - By the way, your kitchen is so...Charming.
###833 - You see what I mean?
###835 - No!
###836 Look, baby,
###837 If I thought for one minute
###839 That those ladies had anything against you,
###841 Believe me, they would be out of here
###842 Faster than you could say, "backstab."
###843 - Backstab.
###846 - Oh, look.
###848 You know what?
###849 You don't like them.
###850 I understand it.
###851 But I just cannot go out there and kick them out of here.
###853 - You could.
###854 You won't, but you could.
###855 - You know what, sweetheart?
###857 If it means that much to you,
###859 I'm just gonna go out there, and I'm gonna end the meeting.
###861 - Thank you.
###867 - All right, here's the cup.
###869 - There's been a change in the agreement.
###871 I want $100.
###873 - $100?
###874 - Either that, or find somebody else.
###875 - $40.
###877 $75.
###878 - $50.
###880 And if you don't do it, we'll get a homeless guy.
###882 - Fine.
###883 - We'll meet you tomorrow night.
###885 - Okay, that it?
###886 - One more thing? - What?
###888 - Keep your mouth shut.
###890 - Get your finger off me.
###891 - I'm sorry.
###894 - What is wrong with you, man?
###895 Get in the house.
###899 - Baby, I'm sorry that those ladies don't like you.
###901 But I can't help it if they like me.
###904 - For the last time, they don't like you.
###907 They're doing it to annoy me.
###909 - Prove it.
###910 - Okay, you want me to prove it?
###911 I'll prove it.
###912 What is this idea you have
###914 That the ladies think is so wonderful?
###916 - Well, I suggested the fund-raiser be '80s funk themed.
###920 Huh?
###922 - And what does that mean, exactly?
###924 - You know,
###925 Shoulder pads, space suits, codpieces.
###928 Ow!
###930 - And where are you supposed to get these codpieces,
###932 At a cameo yard sale?
###934 - I don't know. A costume store?
###936 - In the spring?
###938 Who do you know that carries costumes in the spring
###940 Or are you just gonna make your space suits
###942 Out of aluminum foil?
###944 - No.
###946 - Nick, these ladies couldn't plan a bottle opening.
###949 They don't know a good idea from a bad idea
###951 When they hear one.
###952 - Well, my next idea was a Mardi Gras party.
###955 - Mardi gras? - Mm-Hmm.
###957 - Okay, when's the party?
###958 - April.
###959 - A mardi gras party in April?
###961 - Sure. Why not?
###963 - Because mardi gras is in February.
###965 - It's a mardi gras party. Not mardi gras.
###969 - Okay, what day in April?
###972 - April 15th.
###975 - Tax day?
###977 You're seriously going to plan a fund-raiser
###979 On the day people have to file their taxes?
###983 - Well, not anymore.
###990 So you guys don't think
###991 It's weird celebrating mardi gras in April?
###993 - Oh, no, not at all, Nick.
###995 It's a theme party.
###997 - I have Easter themed parties in September all the time.
###999 - But we're scheduling it for tax day.
###1002 - All the better.
###1003 People will want to celebrate.
###1005 - It can be a mardi tax day party.
###1007 - Ladies, no.
###1008 These are all bad ideas.
###1010 - Oh, Nick, Nick.
###1012 It doesn't really matter.
###1014 We'll make it work.
###1015 We'll figure it out.
###1016 - We're just glad you're here.
###1017 - Right.
###1018 Things are so much better than last year.
###1019 - You mean when Suzanne was here?
###1022 - Well...
###1024 - I hear you. It's okay.
###1026 So you do agree that these ideas are bad?
###1029 - A little.
###1030 - A lot.
###1031 - Okay.
###1033 Here's another idea.
###1034 You're probably gonna hate it.
###1036 But I think it's gonna work.
###1037 - We're all ears.
###1041 - Can you hear me now?
###1043 - Suzanne, terrific.
###1044 - Oh, Carol, just zip it.
###1046 You're trying to play me like the quick pick.
###1049 You put on a bigger show than lady gaga at the grammy's.
###1052 - I don't know what you're talking about.
###1054 - "I don't know what you're talking about."
###1056 That's because you're so fake
###1058 You don't know you have a real problem on your hands.
###1060 - Suzanne...
###1061 - Oh, you want some? Here you go.
###1063 - Melissa, your kids are stupid.
###1066 - That's crossing the line.
###1067 - No, no, that's telling the truth.
###1069 Crossing the line is asking your husband
###1071 Why he's always down at the math class
###1073 Talking to the 22-year-old teacher's aid.
###1076 That's right. Tap out.
###1078 - That was uncalled for.
###1079 - Oh, you got something you want to say, Theresa?
###1081 - I think we should go.
###1083 - Oh, give that woman a hand,
###1085 Because that is the first good idea
###1087 That she has had in her whole life.
###1089 Kick rocks.
###1092 Bye-bye.
###1093 - See, I don't need y'all to plan nothing.
###1097 Don't, don't, 'cause I got vaseline in my purse, Carol.
###1100 You better turn that around.
###1102 I'll snap your fingers right off.
###1109 - Okay, here's your cut.
###1111 $440.
###1113 - Say what?
###1114 Did he just say... yeah, I think he did. Yeah.
###1116 - Okay, we agreed on $450.
###1118 That's ten bucks short.
###1119 - Transaction fee.
###1120 - You're not even a bank.
###1121 - Dude, everybody charges transaction fees.
###1124 It's like taxes.
###1125 You can't get around them.
###1127 - Just take the money, Kevin.
###1128 - Fine.
###1130 Oh, I can't believe it.
###1133 I'm rich!
###1134 Hit it!
###1139 - Ah, I'll just roll around in it naked.
###1141 - I know!
###1143 - Let me get my cut first.
###1151 - Baby, baby.
###1154 That was exactly what I was trying to avoid
###1157 By me taking over for you.
###1159 The only thing missing
###1160 Was you on the roof with a wig and a weave
###1162 Screaming at the police.
###1164 "Ahh! You'll never take me alive!"
###1168 "I'm still alive!"
###1170 "Ahh!"
###1172 Okay, I'm trying to tell you.
###1174 Look, the joke is still on you though.
###1176 - Oh, really?
###1177 And how is that?
###1179 - Well, you are chairman of yet another committee.
###1182 - Darn it.
###1184 Well, I'm not doing it again next year.
###1186 You can count on that.
###1187 - Until they call your name.
###1189 You can count on that.
###1191 "stop it."
###1193 - Stop.
###1195 Hey, you realize something?
###1197 - No, what?
###1198 - It's quiet.
