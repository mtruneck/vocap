0:0:2,211 --> 0:0:3,611
Good morning babe.


2
0:0:3,611 --> 0:0:5,982
Good morning.
You like Jamaican food, right?


3
0:0:5,982 --> 0:0:9,569
I love my food,
like I like my women.


4
0:0:9,569 --> 0:0:12,926
Hot, spicy, exotic,
watch out...


5
0:0:12,926 --> 0:0:14,798
[Laughs]


6
0:0:14,798 --> 0:0:18,34
-Ah, woman.
-What?


7
0:0:18,34 --> 0:0:21,26
I'm assuming you meant to say
"woman" as a singular


8
0:0:21,26 --> 0:0:26,244
'cousing you like me,
because I'm hot, spicy, and exotic.


9
0:0:26,244 --> 0:0:28,538
To me, you're a trip to Caribbean.


10
0:0:28,538 --> 0:0:30,298
Nice save.


11
0:0:30,298 --> 0:0:31,5
What's your making?


12
0:0:31,5 --> 0:0:33,135
- I'm thinking jerk chicken.


13
0:0:33,135 --> 0:0:35,637
- [In bad Jamaican accent] Ooh,
"Jamaican" me hungry, girl.


14
0:0:35,637 --> 0:0:37,439
- Whoo, that was bad.


15
0:0:37,439 --> 0:0:38,774
- Yeah, I don't have
an ear for it.


16
0:0:38,774 --> 0:0:40,642
There's no bald Jamaicans.


17
0:0:40,642 --> 0:0:43,678
Oh, by the way, my new field
producer, Sam, is coming by.


18
0:0:43,678 --> 0:0:44,98
We're gonna cut a package.


19
0:0:44,98 --> 0:0:46,882
- Okay, well, maybe I'll try out
my plantain recipe


20
0:0:46,882 --> 0:0:47,816
on you guys.


21
0:0:47,816 --> 0:0:49,785
- No, no, you save that for me.


22
0:0:49,785 --> 0:0:51,52
I don't know this dude.


23
0:0:51,52 --> 0:0:53,188
I don't want him
eating your food.


24
0:0:53,188 --> 0:0:55,323
Look, I got to find out
if we get along


25
0:0:55,323 --> 0:0:58,16
before we start granting him
[Indistinct], you know!


26
0:0:58,16 --> 0:1:0,729
- Quit.
- Come again!


27
0:1:0,729 --> 0:1:2,497
- [Laughs] Stop.


28
0:1:2,497 --> 0:1:3,965
- Watch me now.


29
0:1:3,965 --> 0:1:6,68
- That's enough, shaggy.


30
0:1:6,68 --> 0:1:7,903
- No, no, no, no, no.


31
0:1:7,903 --> 0:1:11,139
I had a good time last night.


32
0:1:11,139 --> 0:1:12,707
No, really; I did.


33
0:1:12,707 --> 0:1:14,176
I cannot wait to do it again.


34
0:1:14,176 --> 0:1:16,378
Okay.
All right.


35
0:1:16,378 --> 0:1:17,379
I'll talk to you later.


36
0:1:17,379 --> 0:1:18,68
Bye-bye.


37
0:1:18,68 --> 0:1:20,515
- Who are you lying to?


38
0:1:20,515 --> 0:1:22,384
- Who says I'm lying?


39
0:1:22,384 --> 0:1:23,552
- Oh, no, I've spoken to you


40
0:1:23,552 --> 0:1:25,87
when you've had a good time
with someone,


41
0:1:25,87 --> 0:1:26,154
and that is not how you sound.


42
0:1:26,154 --> 0:1:27,856
You squeal.


43
0:1:27,856 --> 0:1:30,525
- I do not squeal.


44
0:1:30,525 --> 0:1:31,993
- Okay, yes, you do.


45
0:1:31,993 --> 0:1:33,295
Remember the guy...
What was his...


46
0:1:33,295 --> 0:1:35,831
The Argentinean guy,
what was his name?


47
0:1:35,831 --> 0:1:37,165
- [High-pitched squeal]
Esteban!


48
0:1:37,165 --> 0:1:39,968
- I rest my case.
So what happened?


49
0:1:39,968 --> 0:1:42,37
- Well, his name is Fender.


50
0:1:42,37 --> 0:1:43,705
- Is his last name bender?


51
0:1:43,705 --> 0:1:45,373
- No, his last name
is not bender.


52
0:1:45,373 --> 0:1:47,75
And he has kids.
- Who has kids?


53
0:1:47,75 --> 0:1:49,778
- Fender.
- Bender.


54
0:1:49,778 --> 0:1:51,746
- Okay, where's the mother?
- Well, they're divorced.


55
0:1:51,746 --> 0:1:54,82
- She left her kids with Fender?
- Bender.


56
0:1:54,82 --> 0:1:57,152
- No, they're his kids;
He adopted.


57
0:1:57,152 --> 0:1:59,821
And it turns out she was,
in his words,


58
0:1:59,821 --> 0:2:1,957
an "unrepentant party girl."


59
0:2:1,957 --> 0:2:3,992
So no problemo there.


60
0:2:3,992 --> 0:2:8,63
- Okay, so back to Fender...
- Bender.


61
0:2:8,63 --> 0:2:11,733
- I thought rule number one
on Gigi's do not date list


62
0:2:11,733 --> 0:2:12,934
was, "no kids."


63
0:2:12,934 --> 0:2:14,503
- No, that's rule number two.


64
0:2:14,503 --> 0:2:15,904
- What's rule number one?


65
0:2:15,904 --> 0:2:17,305
- "You can't be broke."


66
0:2:17,305 --> 0:2:18,306
Which he's not.


67
0:2:18,306 --> 0:2:19,574
So much so,


68
0:2:19,574 --> 0:2:21,743
I'm breaking rule number two.


69
0:2:21,743 --> 0:2:24,88
- Well, you know if you don't
get along with the kids,


70
0:2:24,88 --> 0:2:26,214
that is a deal breaker.


71
0:2:26,214 --> 0:2:27,716
Trust me.
I know.


72
0:2:27,716 --> 0:2:29,651
I'm out of here, baby.


73
0:2:29,651 --> 0:2:31,353
I love you.
- Bye.


74
0:2:31,353 --> 0:2:32,854
- Come on, Kev.
Get your stuff.


75
0:2:32,854 --> 0:2:33,755
- Okay.


76
0:2:33,755 --> 0:2:35,39
Bye, mom.
Bye, Gigi.


77
0:2:35,39 --> 0:2:38,527
- Bye.
- Bye.


78
0:2:38,527 --> 0:2:39,661
- All right, zee,


79
0:2:39,661 --> 0:2:41,496
I'm having a problem
with this man.


80
0:2:41,496 --> 0:2:46,201
- Oh, you having a problem
with a man?


81
0:2:46,201 --> 0:2:47,369
Shocking.


82
0:2:47,369 --> 0:2:49,404
- [Laughs] Whatever.


83
0:2:49,404 --> 0:2:53,8
Okay, well, this week,
I'm going out with his kids


84
0:2:53,8 --> 0:2:54,442
to see if we get along.


85
0:2:54,442 --> 0:2:56,211
Then we move on to phase two.


86
0:2:56,211 --> 0:2:57,212
- Which is?


87
0:2:57,212 --> 0:3:0,415
- A weekend in his villa
in Aspen!


88
0:3:0,415 --> 0:3:2,751
- Well, I don't know
what you're worried about.


89
0:3:2,751 --> 0:3:3,952
You know how to talk to kids.


90
0:3:3,952 --> 0:3:5,353
You talk to mine all the time.


91
0:3:5,353 --> 0:3:6,955
- Well, last night,
we went out to dinner,


92
0:3:6,955 --> 0:3:8,623
and the kids
completely ignored me.


93
0:3:8,623 --> 0:3:11,26
The girl was so busy testing
all the time,


94
0:3:11,26 --> 0:3:13,228
and the boy was glued
to some stupid video game.


95
0:3:13,228 --> 0:3:16,998
- Ah, sounds like
a couple of the kids I know.


96
0:3:16,998 --> 0:3:19,234
- That's it.


97
0:3:19,234 --> 0:3:20,368
- What?


98
0:3:20,368 --> 0:3:22,3
- I need to borrow your kids.


99
0:3:22,3 --> 0:3:25,607
- Oh, let me pack a bag,
and you can keep 'em.

105
0:3:48,63 --> 0:3:50,432
- Oh, tweeting.
Alicia tweets all the time.


106
0:3:50,432 --> 0:3:52,267
I wanna tweet.
- Who's Alicia?


107
0:3:52,267 --> 0:3:53,735
- The daughter
of the guy I'm dating.


108
0:3:53,735 --> 0:3:55,57
I really need
to get to know her.


109
0:3:55,57 --> 0:3:56,538
There's a villa at stake.


110
0:3:56,538 --> 0:3:58,607
- Do you have
a Twitter account?


111
0:3:58,607 --> 0:3:59,874
- Oh, yeah,
I have a bunch of 'em,


112
0:3:59,874 --> 0:4:0,942
but I never use 'em.


113
0:4:0,942 --> 0:4:2,21
- What? Why?


114
0:4:2,21 --> 0:4:3,612
- Because they said on Twitter


115
0:4:3,612 --> 0:4:5,8
in order to create a message,


116
0:4:5,8 --> 0:4:7,115
you need 140 characters.


117
0:4:7,115 --> 0:4:8,583
Now, I came up with a lot...


118
0:4:8,583 --> 0:4:12,587
A vampire, French businessman,
a dragon...


119
0:4:12,587 --> 0:4:14,522
But that's a lot of characters.


120
0:4:14,522 --> 0:4:15,79
- I think I can help you.


121
0:4:15,79 --> 0:4:17,692
Are you gonna be here
when I get home from school?


122
0:4:17,692 --> 0:4:19,461
- I can if you want me to.

- Thank you.

I'm Nick's wife.

- Oh, nice to meet you, Susan.


130
0:4:38,446 --> 0:4:41,82
- Actually, it's Suzanne
with a "z."


131
0:4:41,82 --> 0:4:44,653
- Got it. "Z."


132
0:4:44,653 --> 0:4:47,22

0:4:48,323 --> 0:4:49,457

139
0:4:54,729 --> 0:4:56,598
- So is Sam short
for something?


140
0:4:56,598 --> 0:4:58,767
- I could tell you,
but I might have to kill you.


141
0:4:58,767 --> 0:5:2,504
- Oh, non, please don't...
Don't kill him,


142
0:5:2,504 --> 0:5:4,639
because then
I have to kill you,


143
0:5:4,639 --> 0:5:6,241
and, you know, we've got kids.


144

Can't really afford
to go into hiding.

They have to go to school,

- Deal.
No killing.

Sorry.

I'll see you later, okay?


155
0:5:25,727 --> 0:5:26,728
- Okay.

0:5:26,728 --> 0:5:28,363
Love you, baby.

0:5:28,363 --> 0:5:29,898

0:5:29,898 --> 0:5:33,735

0:5:33,735 --> 0:5:36,671
- Hi.
- Hello.

0:5:36,671 --> 0:5:37,939
- Who is that?


161
0:5:37,939 --> 0:5:40,975
- That is Nick's
field producer, Sam.


162
0:5:40,975 --> 0:5:42,143
- Mmm-Hmm.


163
0:5:42,143 --> 0:5:43,178
Well, it look like Sam


164
0:5:43,178 --> 0:5:50,318
is about to get looked up
on the Internet.


165

Now, see, that makes all
the difference in the world.

Why didn't they just say
"140 letters?"


169
0:5:58,56 --> 0:6:1,96
- You just made
your first official tweet.


170
0:6:1,96 --> 0:6:3,565
- I'm tweeting.


171

- nuh-uh.
How long does this go on?


175
0:6:9,571 --> 0:6:12,107
- Hours, days.
- Okay, that's too long.


176
0:6:12,107 --> 0:6:14,275
Um, I got an idea.


177
0:6:14,275 --> 0:6:19,814
Lindsey, you already know
how to do all this stuff.


178
0:6:19,814 --> 0:6:22,45
Why don't you
just pretend to be me?


179
0:6:22,45 --> 0:6:25,12
You know, all you got to do
is make Alicia think I'm great,


180
0:6:25,12 --> 0:6:29,9
and if any rich man tweets me,
let me know.


181
0:6:29,9 --> 0:6:30,625
- And you think that's right?


182
0:6:30,625 --> 0:6:33,695
- No, but 50 bucks
thinks it's a great idea.


183
0:6:33,695 --> 0:6:36,64
- Consider me you.
- Mmm.


184
0:6:36,64 --> 0:6:37,98
- Where's the $50?


185
0:6:37,98 --> 0:6:38,7
- Oh, you know,
I'm gonna get you later.


186
0:6:38,7 --> 0:6:41,169
All right?
Okay, tweet, tweet!

0:6:41,169 --> 0:6:42,137
- Okay.

would expect to find


190

an 85-year-old man swimming,


191
0:6:47,175 --> 0:6:48,877
but this man is different.


192
0:6:48,877 --> 0:6:51,78
He's training for a swim
across the English Channel.


193
0:6:51,78 --> 0:6:54,616
- Okay, wow,
that was really great.


194

put this piece to bed.

turning that in.


198
0:7:0,922 --> 0:7:2,59
You are not getting me fired.


199
0:7:2,59 --> 0:7:3,691
I see you, girl.


200
0:7:3,691 --> 0:7:5,76
- Don't worry.
We're good.


201
0:7:5,76 --> 0:7:6,828
You hit the number.


202
0:7:6,828 --> 0:7:9,731
All I have to do
is lay the track in.


203
0:7:9,731 --> 0:7:13,168
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.


204
0:7:13,168 --> 0:7:15,236
I didn't realize you guys
were still working.


205
0:7:15,236 --> 0:7:16,671
- Yeah, we took longer
than expected.


206
0:7:16,671 --> 0:7:17,872
We're done.
- Mmm-Hmm.


207
0:7:17,872 --> 0:7:19,774
- Oh, well, I'm on my way
to the store


208
0:7:19,774 --> 0:7:21,676
to pick up my ingredients.


209
0:7:21,676 --> 0:7:24,446
- Oh? Beautiful,
and she can cook?


210
0:7:24,446 --> 0:7:26,481
- With and without the skillet.


211
0:7:26,481 --> 0:7:28,349
- See, I just don't
have the patience.


212
0:7:28,349 --> 0:7:31,786
Hey, restaurants
were made for a reason.


213
0:7:31,786 --> 0:7:34,689
For real.


214
0:7:34,689 --> 0:7:37,659
Well, I'm headed back
to the studio, okay?


215
0:7:37,659 --> 0:7:39,427
So I'll see you later.


216
0:7:39,427 --> 0:7:41,362
- Hey, Sam, thank you
for everything.


217
0:7:41,362 --> 0:7:42,297
- No, thank you, okay?


218
0:7:42,297 --> 0:7:43,965
And don't worry.
All right?


219
0:7:43,965 --> 0:7:45,467
- All right.
Okay.


220
0:7:45,467 --> 0:7:46,968
- You'll do good.


221
0:7:46,968 --> 0:7:49,804
Okay.


222
0:7:49,804 --> 0:7:51,606
It was nice
to meet you, Suzanne...


223
0:7:51,606 --> 0:7:52,774
With a "z."


224
0:7:52,774 --> 0:7:55,477
Okay, guys.
Bye.


225
0:7:55,477 --> 0:8:2,517
- Take care.


226
0:8:2,517 --> 0:8:5,86
- What was that all about?
- What?


227
0:8:5,86 --> 0:8:6,554
- She ate
one of your French fries.


228
0:8:6,554 --> 0:8:9,39
Don't you think that's
a little too familiar?


229
0:8:9,39 --> 0:8:10,758
- Too familiar?


230
0:8:10,758 --> 0:8:12,594
- Yes.
With you.


231
0:8:12,594 --> 0:8:14,629
And she did it
right in front of me.


232
0:8:14,629 --> 0:8:15,73
- Wait, she ate a French fry.


233
0:8:15,73 --> 0:8:17,866
It's not like
she tongue-kissed me.


234
0:8:17,866 --> 0:8:20,502
- Oh, but she wanted to.


235
0:8:20,502 --> 0:8:24,906
- Look, Suzanne,
"a," that's ridiculous.


236
0:8:24,906 --> 0:8:27,609
"B," I love you.


237
0:8:27,609 --> 0:8:30,345
"C," I get it.


238
0:8:30,345 --> 0:8:33,414
She will never eat
my food again.


239
0:8:33,414 --> 0:8:34,782
- Okay.


240
0:8:34,782 --> 0:8:36,551
But if I see her do it again,


241
0:8:36,551 --> 0:8:47,215
somebody's gonna end up
on the news.


242
0:8:47,215 --> 0:8:48,383
- [Squeals loudly]


243
0:8:48,383 --> 0:8:49,885
You know how I do...
Wait, wait, what?


244
0:8:49,885 --> 0:8:52,587
Over...
- Gigi.


245
0:8:52,587 --> 0:8:53,889
- [Squeals loudly]


246
0:8:53,889 --> 0:8:55,757
Okay, back, back, back,
back, back, back!


247
0:8:55,757 --> 0:8:56,825
- Gigi!


248
0:8:56,825 --> 0:8:57,926
- What?


249
0:8:57,926 --> 0:9:0,695
Sorry, I just got wrapped up
in this game.


250
0:9:0,695 --> 0:9:2,764
Okay, this is Fender's kids'
favorite game.


251
0:9:2,764 --> 0:9:5,0
Kevin showed me a website
where I could learn how to play,


252
0:9:5,0 --> 0:9:6,101
and I'm playing,


253
0:9:6,101 --> 0:9:8,103
and I almost destroyed
the castle.


254
0:9:8,103 --> 0:9:10,539
- Do you mind if we talk about
real life for a second?


255
0:9:10,539 --> 0:9:12,607
- Okay.
What's wrong?


256
0:9:12,607 --> 0:9:14,509
- You remember Sam, right?


257
0:9:14,509 --> 0:9:19,414
- Samuela Patricia Garnet,
born 11/15/75.


258
0:9:19,414 --> 0:9:21,583
- A scorpio?
- Scorpio.


259
0:9:21,583 --> 0:9:22,951
- Ooh, I should have known.


260
0:9:22,951 --> 0:9:25,587
- Samuela graduated with a b.A.
In communications


261
0:9:25,587 --> 0:9:26,922
from Trenton state,


262
0:9:26,922 --> 0:9:29,191
she's been married once
to a Lawrence garnet,


263
0:9:29,191 --> 0:9:31,326
they're divorced,
she has no kids,


264
0:9:31,326 --> 0:9:34,963
and the rest is in a file
on your desktop labeled "skank."


265
0:9:34,963 --> 0:9:36,364
- Skank?
- Skank.


266
0:9:36,364 --> 0:9:37,566
- I like that.


267
0:9:37,566 --> 0:9:39,768
- What'd she do?
- [Sighs]


268
0:9:39,768 --> 0:9:41,703
She and Nick were eating lunch
yesterday,


269
0:9:41,703 --> 0:9:43,171
and she reached over...


270
0:9:43,171 --> 0:9:44,506
- Reached over?


271
0:9:44,506 --> 0:9:46,241
- And grabbed one of his fries.


272
0:9:46,241 --> 0:9:48,343
- Grabbed one of his fries?
- Yes.


273
0:9:48,343 --> 0:9:49,778
- Right in front of your face?


274
0:9:49,778 --> 0:9:53,915
- Didn't think about
trying to hide it.


275
0:9:53,915 --> 0:9:55,55
- If you need it...


276
0:9:55,55 --> 0:9:57,886
And I'm not saying
I know how to get it...


277
0:9:57,886 --> 0:10:0,822
But if you did,
and you asked me,


278
0:10:0,822 --> 0:10:2,257
I might be in touch
with some people


279
0:10:2,257 --> 0:10:5,193
who know how to make things
look like an accident.


280
0:10:5,193 --> 0:10:6,194
- You are?


281
0:10:6,194 --> 0:10:7,796
- I'm not saying I am...


282
0:10:7,796 --> 0:10:9,931
But I might be.


283
0:10:9,931 --> 0:10:12,267
- Okay, well, I don't think
there's any need


284
0:10:12,267 --> 0:10:14,636
to start planning accidents
just yet.


285
0:10:14,636 --> 0:10:17,272
- She grabbed the fry!
- Grabbed the fry.


286
0:10:17,272 --> 0:10:18,507
- Right in front of your face.


287
0:10:18,507 --> 0:10:19,608
- In my face.


288
0:10:19,608 --> 0:10:20,942
- That's too familiar.


289
0:10:20,942 --> 0:10:22,21
That's what I said.


290
0:10:22,21 --> 0:10:23,311
- What'd Nick say?


291
0:10:23,311 --> 0:10:25,18
- "Too familiar?
You're being ridiculous."


292
0:10:25,18 --> 0:10:26,848
- Hmm.


293
0:10:26,848 --> 0:10:30,852
You eat a man's fry,


294
0:10:30,852 --> 0:10:32,2
that's a metaphor.


295
0:10:32,2 --> 0:10:33,855
You do it in front of his wife,


296
0:10:33,855 --> 0:10:35,123
that's war,


297
0:10:35,123 --> 0:10:36,391
and you need to shut that down.


298
0:10:36,391 --> 0:10:38,927
- Well, Nick said he understood


299
0:10:38,927 --> 0:10:41,863
and he promised me
that it wouldn't happen again.


300
0:10:41,863 --> 0:10:45,734
- Well, if you need
to stage a mishap,


301
0:10:45,734 --> 0:10:49,271
you let me know.


302
0:10:49,271 --> 0:10:51,139
- Can I pillage this village?


303
0:10:51,139 --> 0:10:52,707
You got five minutes.


304
0:10:52,707 --> 0:10:55,31
- [Squeals, giggles]


305
0:10:55,31 --> 0:10:57,746
You okay?


306
0:10:57,746 --> 0:10:59,414
You sure?


307
0:10:59,414 --> 0:11:0,916
All right.


308
0:11:0,916 --> 0:11:3,84
Oh, Sookie, Sookie.


309
0:11:3,84 --> 0:11:6,488
Move it.
Move it.


310
0:11:6,488 --> 0:11:10,458
- Gigi!
You ready to play?


311
0:11:10,458 --> 0:11:12,127
- Yes, sensei.


312
0:11:12,127 --> 0:11:14,296
- You really didn't have
to get dressed up for the game.


313
0:11:14,296 --> 0:11:15,964
- Too much?
- A little.


314
0:11:15,964 --> 0:11:18,133
- Okay.
- Here's your sword.


315
0:11:18,133 --> 0:11:21,336
Now, all you have to do
is pick your avatar,


316
0:11:21,336 --> 0:11:22,437
and we can get started.


317
0:11:22,437 --> 0:11:23,772
- What, now?


318
0:11:23,772 --> 0:11:26,341
- Pick the person
you want to play for you.


319
0:11:26,341 --> 0:11:27,375
- I know.


320
0:11:27,375 --> 0:11:28,777
I know how to play.
I'm cool.


321
0:11:28,777 --> 0:11:30,11
[Laughs]


322
0:11:30,11 --> 0:11:31,379
Okay, come on.
Let's see.


323
0:11:31,379 --> 0:11:33,14
Oh, she looks good
and quick on her feet,


324
0:11:33,14 --> 0:11:34,182
and I love her outfit.


325
0:11:34,182 --> 0:11:35,15
- Okay, then pick her.


326
0:11:35,15 --> 0:11:36,184
- Oh, no, no, no,


327
0:11:36,184 --> 0:11:37,719
because, see, I like his shield.


328
0:11:37,719 --> 0:11:38,82
- Oh, his shield.


329
0:11:38,82 --> 0:11:40,355
- Yeah, and then...
Oh...


330
0:11:40,355 --> 0:11:41,756
No, see...


331
0:11:41,756 --> 0:11:44,392
Those shoes aren't good.


332
0:11:44,392 --> 0:11:54,2
Oh...
No.


333
0:11:54,2 --> 0:11:55,937
Okay, okay, okay.


334
0:11:55,937 --> 0:11:58,373
I'm gonna pick samurai Sally.


335
0:11:58,373 --> 0:12:0,909
- Um, samurai Sally?
- Samurai Sally.


336
0:12:0,909 --> 0:12:3,578
She's cute.


337
0:12:3,578 --> 0:12:5,447
- Hey, Gigi.
- Hey.


338
0:12:5,447 --> 0:12:8,516
- Alicia's really
pumping you up.


339
0:12:8,516 --> 0:12:9,918
- She likes you.
I can tell.


340
0:12:9,918 --> 0:12:10,885
- Let me see.


341
0:12:10,885 --> 0:12:13,922
Great!
Thank you, Lindsey.


342
0:12:13,922 --> 0:12:17,292
Now, who are these little boys
following me?


343
0:12:17,292 --> 0:12:18,526
- I don't know,


344
0:12:18,526 --> 0:12:19,661
but they think you're cool.


345
0:12:19,661 --> 0:12:22,297
- Well, they have good taste.


346
0:12:22,297 --> 0:12:23,598
- Hold on, hold on.


347
0:12:23,598 --> 0:12:27,535
I'm gonna make her waist
a little bit smaller.


348
0:12:27,535 --> 0:12:29,4
Perfect.


349
0:12:29,4 --> 0:12:30,505
That was fun!


350
0:12:30,505 --> 0:12:31,673
Okay, let's play that again.


351
0:12:31,673 --> 0:12:33,608
- Gigi, that wasn't the game.


352
0:12:33,608 --> 0:12:34,409
- No?
- No.


353
0:12:34,409 --> 0:12:35,143
- This is the game.


354
0:12:35,143 --> 0:12:38,79
- Oh!


355
0:12:38,79 --> 0:12:46,121
[Exhaling dramatically]


356
0:12:46,121 --> 0:12:47,989
Fight!


357
0:12:47,989 --> 0:12:53,294
- Okay, fight.


358
0:12:53,294 --> 0:12:56,498
- Hey, the piece came out
really good.


359
0:12:56,498 --> 0:12:58,566
- Cool.


360
0:12:58,566 --> 0:13:0,168
- You know, you're pretty new
to this.


361
0:13:0,168 --> 0:13:2,37
I mean, are you liking it
so far?


362
0:13:2,37 --> 0:13:4,305
- I mean,
it's a great opportunity.


363
0:13:4,305 --> 0:13:5,64
You know?


364
0:13:5,64 --> 0:13:6,975
Ain't nothing wrong with that.


365
0:13:6,975 --> 0:13:8,243
- I know.


366
0:13:8,243 --> 0:13:15,85
You never want to pass up
a great opportunity.


367
0:13:15,85 --> 0:13:19,954
- Sam, you know, I don't want
to make things seem awkward,


368
0:13:19,954 --> 0:13:23,458
but I'd prefer it
if you didn't do that.


369
0:13:23,458 --> 0:13:26,828
Look, I just don't really like
people eating off my plate.


370
0:13:26,828 --> 0:13:29,164
- I'm sorry.
My bad.


371
0:13:29,164 --> 0:13:30,799
You know, I ain't mean nothing
by it.


372
0:13:30,799 --> 0:13:33,902
You know, I just got
a thing for French fries.


373
0:13:33,902 --> 0:13:40,709
Especially the hot brown ones.


374
0:13:40,709 --> 0:13:43,311
- Can we get some more fries
over here, please?


375
0:13:43,311 --> 0:13:53,254
Waitress?


376
0:13:53,254 --> 0:13:55,59
- Hey, honey.


377
0:13:55,59 --> 0:13:57,625
- Where were you?


378
0:13:57,625 --> 0:14:0,428
- Me and Sam
had to finish up a project.


379
0:14:0,428 --> 0:14:3,264
I'm sorry I'm late.


380
0:14:3,264 --> 0:14:6,568
What's that?


381
0:14:6,568 --> 0:14:8,103
- This was your dinner.


382
0:14:8,103 --> 0:14:11,39
- Oh, baby, I did not know


383
0:14:11,39 --> 0:14:12,941
you were cooking
your meal today.


384
0:14:12,941 --> 0:14:14,476
- Perhaps
if you would have called,


385
0:14:14,476 --> 0:14:16,544
you would have been informed.


386
0:14:16,544 --> 0:14:18,213
- You're right.
You're right.


387
0:14:18,213 --> 0:14:19,581
I should have called.


388
0:14:19,581 --> 0:14:21,783
But our assignment
went into overtime.
