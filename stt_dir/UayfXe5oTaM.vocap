###17 Man: Watch it, man.
###17 Push him away.
###18 Push him away.
###19 Blevins: Stop right there!
###20 <i> Narrator: From what they  perceive as the fast</i>
###22 <i> approaching end of the  world as we know it.</i>
###28 Daughter: Dad!
###29 Braxton: Leave her alone!
###32 <i> Narrator: Next, we  go inside the lives</i>
###34 <i> of three committed  preppers who have</i>
###36 <i> devised  extensive plans.</i>
###38 Patrick: Let's get the house secure,
###39 get the doors locked, get the windows locked.
###41 Brian: Come on.
###42 We're bugging out.
###43 Let's go, babe.
###44 <i> Narrator: Gone to  great lengths and</i>
###47 <i> made huge personal  sacrifices to</i>
###49 <i> ensure their  very survival.</i>
###51 Bryan: We carry usually 3-4,000
###53 rounds of every single caliber of
###55 ammo at all times.
###57 <i> Narrator: The experts  will assess their preps,</i>
###59 <i> to see if they  have what it takes.</i>
###62 Jay: There's a very thin fabric that
###63 holds together a civilized society.
###66 <i> Narrator:  To survive.</i>
###70 Jay: Go!
###70 Go!
###72 <i> Narrator: This is  Doomsday Preppers.</i>
###90 <i> Jay Blevins is a  young father of three.</i>
###93 Jay: Oh man.
###95 You're too big.
###96 Daughter: No, I'm not.
###98 <i> Narrator: Living in  the small town of</i>
###99 <i> Berryville, Virginia,</i>
###101 <i> 60 miles outside  Washington D.C.</i>
###103 <i> He and his wife,  Holly, love the</i>
###105 <i> tranquility of  their neighborhood.</i>
###108 <i> Here, they can raise  their children in</i>
###110 <i> a spacious home,  alongside a close-knit</i>
###113 <i> community of friends.</i>
###115 <i> But behind the front doors  of Jay's quiet cul-de-sac</i>
###118 <i> there's growing fear  about the future.</i>
###122 Jay: We're preparing for the breakdown of social
###124 order caused by an economic collapse.
###129 Are they shooting up there?
###130 Go!
###132 I believe our life is different because we prep.
###135 I believe it's a better quality of life.
###137 I think it was a combination of things,
###139 like September 11th, like the tsunami of 2004.
###143 A combination of experiences I've had as
###145 law enforcement officer lead me to believe we are
###148 susceptible to certain situations
###150 that are out of our control.
###151 I want my family to be ready for
###153 those type of situations.
###155 <i> Narrator: Jay believes the  world will soon enter a</i>
###157 <i> global depression, causing  unemployment worse than</i>
###160 <i> the Great Depression  that could collapse</i>
###162 <i> civilized society  altogether.</i>
###165 Jay: When people can't get jobs and
###167 then can't feed their families,
###168 I think those are the types of things
###170 that will really set them off.
###172 You see people rioting and
###174 you see people basically destroying things
###176 because they're not getting their way.
###178 There's a very thin fabric that holds
###181 together a civilized society.
###183 <i> Narrator: With more  than 5.5 million</i>
###185 <i> people in the  greater D.C. area,</i>
###187 <i> Jay fears that urban  unrest could spill into</i>
###190 <i> suburbs and overwhelm  local police officers.</i>
###194 Jay: Once the mob mentality sets in it all
###197 adds up to a situation that could be very,
###201 very dangerous to try to survive in.
###204 <i> Narrator: Jay fears  violence and looting could</i>
###207 <i> potentially spill  into his neighborhood.</i>
###209 <i> So he's fortified his  4,000 square foot</i>
###211 <i> home with things  he'll need to stay</i>
###213 <i> off the streets, like six  months of food and water.</i>
###217 Jay: We believe strongly in sheltering in place.
###220 You know, we have the home field advantage here.
###222 We know where our supplies are.
###224 We have a lot of supplies.
###225 Holly: I prefer that all of our preps
###227 be kept in closets, garages and storage sheds.
###231 We like to maintain some normalcy,
###233 even though we do this on the side.
###235 <i> Narrator: As a former  police officer,</i>
###236 <i> Jay's main focus  is on security.</i>
###239 Jay: We keep a total of about 7,000
###241 rounds of ammunition in the bedroom.
###243 Holly: Ok, so I guess we have a samurai sword
###246 in this closet.
###247 Jay: I love my kids so much.
###248 I love my wife so much.
###250 I don't ever want to see them hurt or to go without
###253 and so if a crowd were ever to come to my house
###256 for whatever reason, I would defend my family.
###259 <i> Narrator: Mob violence  is considered highly</i>
###261 <i> dangerous because it  is so unpredictable.</i>
###264 <i> To survive, officers are  trained to cycle through</i>
###267 <i> multiple defense options,  starting with deterrents</i>
###270 <i> and ending with  lethal measures.</i>
###273 <i> Police call this continuum  the Circle of Force.</i>
###277 Jay: Seven things that I believe are essential for
###279 the circle of force are: rifle, a handgun,
###285 edged weapons, impact weapons, pepper spray,
###289 martial arts and verbal commands.
###291 Jay: Stop!
###292 Get on the ground!
###293 You can use different things immediately.
###297 You can go to whatever option you
###298 need based on the situation.
###300 You encounter a person and they're attacking you with
###303 a knife, you don't have to say something first.
###306 You can go straight to lethal force because
###309 it's being brought against you.
###311 <i> Narrator: Jay wants  to avoid having</i>
###313 <i> to use lethal  force, if possible.</i>
###315 Jay: Who needs gloves out there?
###316 Holly: I need gloves.
###318 <i> Narrator: So today he's  working with Holly to</i>
###320 <i> install a non-violent  first line of defense.</i>
###323 <i> One he hopes his entire  prepping network</i>
###325 <i> can implement to  persuade looters to</i>
###327 <i> move on to  other houses.</i>
###329 Jay: The way our plan is set up,
###330 we have many families.
###332 In fact we probably 20 families representing
###335 75-100 people involved in our network.
###338 In a shelter in place scenario,
###340 the network puts boards over the windows and
###344 doors in order to secure the first level and
###346 then the network would work together to
###349 secure the perimeter of the property.
###351 So we're basically trying to get all the entrances,
###354 all the entry points on the first floor because
###357 those are the points that are vulnerable
###358 to attack if someone is trying to get in.
###360 Friend: Okay.
###361 <i> Narrator: Plywood is often  used to fortify homes in</i>
###363 <i> hurricane zones,  because it is flexible</i>
###366 <i> and able to absorb  the impact of</i>
###367 <i> 100 mile per  hour winds.</i>
###370 Jay: I need the two-by-four,
###371 who's got that?
###372 <i> Narrator: But anchoring  plywood boards to the</i>
###374 <i> front of the window,  by bolting them to a</i>
###376 <i> horizontal  two-by-four,</i>
###377 <i> gives the wood  increased strength.</i>
###379 <i> Jay believes it's  perfect for preppers.</i>
###382 Jay: Push on it guys.
###383 <i> Narrator: Because a  three-quarter-inch thick</i>
###385 <i> piece can withstand  repeated blunt force</i>
###387 <i> attacks without  cracking or breaking.</i>
###390 <i> Jay has custom  pieces ready to go,</i>
###393 <i> so that he and Holly can  install them in all their</i>
###395 <i> downstairs windows in  half an hour or less.</i>
###398 Jay: If you hear beating on this window right here,
###401 you'll know okay I got to go upstairs,
###403 look down and see what's going on and
###405 try to take care of that threat.
###406 Holly: Okay.
###407 Okay, I can do it.
###408 Jay: They wouldn't last forever.
###409 If you had an unlimited amount of
###411 time you could probably chop or hack through them,
###413 maybe pry them off.
###416 <i> Narrator: So now, Jay,  Holly and their friends</i>
###419 <i> are putting their  fortifications up against</i>
###421 <i> a number of weapons  looters might possess.</i>
###424 Friend: That's pretty good.
###425 You're going to be there all day trying
###426 to get in with a knife.
###431 Jay: Wow.
###432 There you go.
###433 Friend: Three strikes and you're out.
###435 Jay: Man.
###436 Holly: Good, Katie!
###438 Jay: Wow.
###439 That was a, I'm impressed.
###441 Friend: Come on, harder.
###444 Katie: Come on, your kids are hungry.
###445 Friend: Harder!
###446 Friend 2: You can't hit it hard enough
###447 to make it go through.
###448 Holly: By the time you hear them doing it,
###450 you're going to shoot them.
###451 Jay: Holly will be upstairs with
###452 the .22, hopefully.
###453 Holly: Picking you off.
###455 Jay: Yeah, all right.
###456 Good.
###457 The way that we've designed this is that
###459 we put the boards over just the first level,
###461 so that on the second level we can
###463 watch from there.
###464 We can utilize the different weapons
###466 we have to defend the homes.
###469 <i> Narrator: But rather than  rain down lethal bullets,</i>
###471 <i> Jay's moving up the Circle  of Force to a non-lethal</i>
###474 <i> measure, one used by  97% of American police</i>
###478 <i> departments for  crowd control.</i>
###481 Jay: We do manufacture our own pepper spray here.
###483 If you have a group of armed people outside of
###485 your house I wanted to have an option to
###488 encourage them to get of the property.
###490 Having had pepper spray used on me in the Police
###492 Academy, I know it works very well.
###495 I do recall one person actually crying for their
###498 mommy when they were sprayed with pepper spray.
###501 <i> Narrator: The base  ingredient of law</i>
###502 <i> enforcement grade pepper  spray is capsaicin,</i>
###505 <i> the active component  of chili peppers.</i>
###508 <i> Today he's going to test  his recipe on two other</i>
###510 <i> members of his prepper  network, Trevor and Eric.</i>
###514 <i> By mixing store-bought  peppers with an acidic</i>
###517 <i> binding agent  like lemon juice,</i>
###519 <i> Jay believes he can make  a homemade brew potent</i>
###522 <i> enough to cause temporary  pain and blindness.</i>
###525 Jay: And then the Habanera sauce of course
###527 is to burn your face off.
###530 The whole bottle.
###533 Friend: That's really gonna hurt.
###537 Jay: That's perfect.
###538 Friend: That's not gonna feel very good on my face.
###540 Friend 2: So how are you gonna deliver this?
###542 I mean, are you gonna splash it on me,
###543 are we gonna dip our face in there?
###544 I mean what do you?
###545 Jay: Well actually lemme go get it and
###547 I'll tell you.
###549 <i> Narrator: For delivery,  Jay's repurposed a</i>
###551 <i> suburban mainstay  that is inexpensive,</i>
###553 <i> has a range of 30 feet  and is inconspicuous</i>
###556 <i> in a neighborhood  filled with children.</i>
###559 Jay: Okay guys, so this is our sophisticated
###560 delivery system here.
###561 Friend: Water guns of, uh, death and fire.
###564 <i> Narrator: Jay's recipe  should be strong enough to</i>
###566 <i> cause excruciating  pain, burning and</i>
###569 <i> involuntary swelling of  the eyes and throat.</i>
###572 <i> But Jay is basing  today's test on the</i>
###574 <i> police rule of thumb that  aggressors can cover</i>
###577 <i> 21 feet in one and  a half seconds.</i>
###580 <i> If the pepper spray  doesn't drop Trevor and</i>
###582 <i> Eric to the ground  before they can get</i>
###584 <i> close enough to assault  him, it's useless.</i>
###588 Jay: Stop right there!
###588 What do you want?
###589 Friends: We're taking what we need!
###590 Jay: Stop right there!
###591 Friend: We're going in!
###592 We're taking what we need!
###594 We're taking it!
###596 Ahh, ahh!
###598 Jay: Stop!
###599 Stay down!
###600 Friends: Owwww!
###601 Uhhh, owww!
###603 Jay: Pepper spray feels like having
###605 liquid magma on your face.
###606 Friend: Oh, it works!
###608 Jay: Put your head down,
###609 otherwise it's going to just go all over you.
###610 Ready?
###611 Friend: What is this?
###611 Jay: It's the milk.
###613 Friend: It definitely stopped
###614 what I wanted to do.
###616 <i> Narrator: Jay's  pepper spray worked,</i>
###617 <i> but not fast enough.</i>
###618 <i> Trevor and Eric were able  to reach his position</i>
###621 <i> before the spray  took effect.</i>
###624 <i> So he's ready to move  up the Circle of Force</i>
###627 <i> to more extreme  options.</i>
###629 <i> To prepare for  the possible mob</i>
###631 <i> attacks he fears,  Jay is building a</i>
###633 <i> prepper response  force of his own.</i>
###636 <i> Now, they'll set their  sights on each other,</i>
###639 <i> for the ultimate test  of home security.</i>
###648 <i> Narrator: Former police  officer Jay Blevins has</i>
###651 <i> turned his home into  a suburban stronghold.</i>
###654 Jay: This can be a suburban fortress,
###656 a place where my family can be safe.
###659 <i> Narrator: Behind these  walls he expects to make</i>
###661 <i> his stand against an  invasion of rioting</i>
###663 <i> marauders following  an economic collapse.</i>
###667 <i> But he doesn't plan  on doing it alone.</i>
###669 <i> In Jay's densely  populated cul-de-sac,</i>
###672 <i> neighbors could  easily turn into</i>
###674 <i> the mob he fears.</i>
###675 <i> But Jay hopes to  preempt this threat,</i>
###677 <i> by recruiting  his neighbors</i>
###679 <i> into a prepping  network.</i>
###681 <i> Together, he believes  they can defend their</i>
###683 <i> neighborhood through  whatever means necessary,</i>
###686 <i> including  lethal force.</i>
###689 Jay: We have a group here at the house
###690 that meets once a month.
###692 It's my network of preppers.
###694 Prepping is a growing movement.
###695 Specifically this year, I would say,
###697 the group has doubled in size.
###699 <i> Narrator: Today, Jay  has gathered his</i>
###701 <i> prepping group to run  the ultimate test of</i>
###703 <i> all his preps: a mob  assault on the front door.</i>
###709 <i> Armed with pellet guns,  Jay will lead one team</i>
###712 <i> acting as a mob  of home invaders.</i>
###714 <i> Patrick, a certified  firearms expert,</i>
###717 <i> will work with Holly and  a second team inside the</i>
###720 <i> house to neutralize  the marauders.</i>
###730 Patrick: Let's get the house secure!
###731 Get the doors locked!
###732 Get the windows locked!
###733 You're using this wall as cover,
###734 so when they come through they're not gonna be able
###737 to see you, so you can pop out and engage.
###739 <i> Narrator: Not knowing from  what direction the attack</i>
###741 <i> will come, the goal is to  see if they can use their</i>
###744 <i> preps to take control  of the situation.</i>
###747 <i> They hope the boarded-up  windows will direct</i>
###749 <i> intruders toward the only  available entry point:</i>
###752 <i> the front door.</i>
###753 <i> The plan is to turn  it into a kill-box,</i>
###756 <i> a bottleneck where  intruders can be</i>
###758 <i> shot down from  multiple angles.</i>
###760 Patrick: Remember, they all still have to get
###762 through the funnel of death.
###763 They've gotta get through that choke point.
###765 Jay: All right guys, game faces on.
###780 Man: Is this John's house?
###782 Girl: Get off the property!
###783 Jay: Oh hey.
###784 We're just looking for John.
###785 What are you doing?
###786 I got pepper sprayed!
###788 Are they shooting up there?
###794 Go!
###795 Go!
###801 Patrick: Library, report.
###803 Holly: VCA down in the library.
###804 Patrick: Close the front door and lock it!
###807 All operators into the family room!
###811 Scenario's over.
###813 Safeties on, guns holstered.
###815 Muzzles down.
###817 <i> Narrator: In all,  50 shots were</i>
###818 <i> fired in today's  assault.</i>
###820 <i> All three of the  mob assailants were</i>
###822 <i> "killed" within 3 feet  of the front door.</i>
###825 Jay: Ah dude, I got lit up.
###826 I came in straight and to the right.
###828 Bullets seemed like they were coming from
###829 the front and the side.
###831 And I got hit about I don't know, 14 times.
###833 There was like four or five fatal shots.
###835 Holly: As soon as I heard the front door
###837 get kicked open, I was already ready for them.
###839 And I got Jamie and then I got Dan and about ten
###843 seconds later Ryan came to the door
###845 and I, to the chest immediately.
###847 So I got all 3, yay!
###848 My only thought is to make sure that none
###852 of these men get past me to my kids.
###854 Jay: So the moral of the story is be the good guys,
###856 not the bad guys.
###857 In a prepper situation, it's good to have a
###859 variety of different things at your disposal to
###862 deal with the person that is attacking you.
###865 A lot of times people think that preppers are
###867 sort of a subculture or a fringe of society.
###870 But if an economic collapse takes place,
###872 I do believe that our prepper network
###874 will survive.
###878 <i> Narrator: Jay,  the experts,</i>
###879 <i> practical preppers,  commend you for adapting</i>
###882 <i> the policemen's Circle of  Force to defend your home.</i>
###885 <i> Additionally, by working  with a prepper network,</i>
###888 <i> you diversify the skills  at your disposal and</i>
###891 <i> further protect  your family.</i>
###892 <i> However, while your  security is adequate,</i>
###895 <i> your food and water  storage are insufficient.</i>
###898 Jay: I think we do need to get a little bit
###900 more in our food storage.
###901 Uh, but we also have in our network,
###903 some folks that can do hunting and trapping.
###906 <i> Narrator: To determine how  long you could initially</i>
###908 <i> survive a catastrophe,  practical preppers has</i>
###910 <i> scored your preps in five  categories of 20 points</i>
###914 <i> each, for a total  possible score of 100.</i>
###919 <i> Food: 10 out  of 20 points.</i>
###922 <i> Water: 11 out  of 20 points.</i>
###924 <i> Shelter: You need a  plan to heat your home,</i>
###928 <i> 8 out of 20 points.</i>
###929 <i> Security: 16 out  of 20 points.</i>
###933 <i> In addition, your network  of preppers is excellent</i>
###936 <i> and will increase your  family's odds of survival.</i>
###939 <i> 13 x-factor points.</i>
###941 <i> Overall, you get 58  out of 100 points.</i>
###945 <i> You have eight months  initial survival time.</i>
###948 Jay: I think we're doing a little bit better in a
###950 couple of those areas, but there is definitely
###952 room for improvement.
###953 We'll definitely take a lot of those into
###955 consideration 'cause we do wanna survive
###956 a lot longer.
###959 Since National Geographic was here,
###961 we've planted fruit trees, a large garden and other
###964 edible plants and have begun canning and will
###966 continue to do so for long term storage.
###971 <i> Narrator: In spite of  the recent recession and</i>
###973 <i> European debt crisis,  most economists believe a</i>
###976 <i> near-term depression is  unlikely and the odds of a</i>
###979 <i> global collapse that  would result in a severe</i>
###981 <i> breakdown of  society are remote.</i>
###987 <i> In his effort to survive a  potential third world war,</i>
###990 <i> Brian Murdock thought the  one prep he needed most of</i>
###993 <i> all was a wife.</i>
###995 <i> But when he tells  his new bride-to-be</i>
###997 <i> that he's a prepper,</i>
###998 <i> he might find himself a  bachelor all over again.</i>
###1001 Tatiana: Leave me alone.
###1001 I need to get out of here.
###1006 <i> Narrator: Brian Murdock  is a real estate broker,</i>
###1008 <i> who lives in Somerville,  Massachusetts,</i>
###1010 <i> a blue collar college  town a few miles</i>
###1012 <i> north of Boston.</i>
###1014 <i> As a single guy  in his twenties,</i>
###1016 <i> Brian was always out  enjoying the city.</i>
###1020 <i> But these days  he's settling down,</i>
###1022 <i> and focusing on more  serious matters.</i>
###1025 Brian: I believe there will be a
###1026 third world war in my lifetime.
###1028 It's inevitable that there will be
###1030 nuclear weapons in World War III.
###1032 I know that with every fiber of my being.
###1035 <i> Narrator: Brian believes  that an attack by the</i>
###1037 <i> United States on  Iran will result</i>
###1039 <i> in a counterattack  on Israel.</i>
###1041 <i> He sees the world  then breaking into two</i>
###1044 <i> factions, each  armed with weapons</i>
###1046 <i> of mass destruction.</i>
###1049 <i> He fears a series of  nuclear detonations</i>
###1052 <i> could kill a third of  all people on earth.</i>
###1055 Brian: There were 50 million casualties
###1057 in World War II.
###1059 World War III is going to be 40 times
###1061 World War II.
###1062 And it's going to be 2.3 billion people.
###1065 One third of the Earth will perish.
###1068 All it takes is someone to put their
###1070 finger on a button.
###1076 <i> Narrator: Brian lives  in a 1,200 square foot</i>
###1078 <i> apartment, three miles from  Boston's busiest square.</i>
###1082 <i> A beginning prepping setup  for this kind of space</i>
###1085 <i> would usually cost  around $1,500.</i>
###1088 <i> But last year Brian sold  most of his belongings and</i>
###1091 <i> spent the proceeds,  around $75,000</i>
###1095 <i> to secure a new home,  somewhere to bug out to.</i>
###1099 Brian: In a year of being a prepper I've purchased a
###1101 motor home RV and 50 acres of land.
###1104 There's water sources on the 50 acres
###1106 of land that I own.
###1109 There's two ponds.
###1111 There's a dedicated well.
###1112 <i> Narrator: As  is recommended</i>
###1114 <i> for urban preppers,</i>
###1115 <i> Brian's bug-out location  in upstate New York</i>
###1117 <i> is more than two hours  from a city center</i>
###1119 <i> but can be reached in  less than five hours.</i>
###1123 <i> But before Brian  permanently moves out of</i>
###1125 <i> Somerville there's  still one of part of his</i>
###1127 <i> prepping plan  that's missing.</i>
###1130 <i> Today, that final  piece is due to arrive.</i>
###1134 Brian: It's a work in progress,
###1136 but I'm very close to having everything
###1138 in place for my prepper goal.
###1143 Tatiana: I'm so excited.
###1152 Brian: Hello, baby.
###1155 How was your flight?
###1157 Tatiana: It was good.
###1158 Brian: Nice weather.
###1159 Kind of like Colombia, right?
###1161 I can't believe you're finally here.
###1162 Tatiana has made her first trip to
###1165 America to marry me.
###1168 Brian: How do you like my house?
###1169 Tatiana: It's beautiful.
###1170 Super beautiful.
###1172 Brian: Did you have any problem getting
###1173 through immigration or anything like that?
###1174 Tatiana: No.
###1175 Everything was so perfect.
###1177 Brian: I think Tatiana will be the
###1178 perfect prepper wife.
###1181 <i> Narrator: A year ago,  Brian met Tatiana on a</i>
###1183 <i> dating website and  then made two trips to</i>
###1186 <i> Colombia to get  to know her.</i>
###1189 <i> He asked her to leave her  life in Colombia behind</i>
###1192 <i> and come to Somerville  to be his fiancée</i>
###1194 <i> and prepping partner.</i>
###1197 <i> Today is the first day  of her new American life.</i>
###1200 Tatiana: A nice house.
###1202 Brian: Si baby, thank you.
###1204 This is a bedroom here.
###1205 Tatiana: Is this your room?
###1209 Brian: I believe the blessing of marriage
###1211 and the covenant of marriage is very
###1212 essential to prepping.
###1214 <i> Narrator: When Brian  met Tatiana he believed</i>
###1216 <i> he'd not only found  the ideal partner,</i>
###1218 <i> but a powerful prep.</i>
###1220 Brian: I had heard a lot of good things
###1222 about her culture and the way of life.
###1225 It's very simple, there's a lot of gratitude.
###1227 A lot of the aspects of prepping
###1230 already resides within her.
###1232 Tatiana: Baby.
###1233 Brian: What's going on?
###1234 Tatiana: Can you help me to turn this on please?
###1236 Brian: Of course.
###1237 <i> Narrator: In the past  year he's learned that the</i>
###1239 <i> chances of surviving any  catastrophic event greatly</i>
###1242 <i> increase when you have  a partner who is also</i>
###1244 <i> invested in  your survival.</i>
###1248 <i> But Brian hasn't told  Tatiana that he plans for</i>
###1250 <i> them to one day leave  all of this behind and</i>
###1253 <i> bug-out to his rural  tract of land.</i>
###1256 <i> Now, Tatiana's learning  that coming to Somerville</i>
###1260 <i> was only the first part  of her American journey.</i>
###1264 Brian: So.
###1265 I've talked to you about uh,
###1267 things I'm concerned about,
###1269 you know if there was ever a nuclear attack.
###1272 You know, Boston we're three miles
###1275 from downtown right here.
###1276 I love you to death and as we start our lives
###1279 together, you know I really want to position
###1281 ourselves, you know in a place where if something
###1284 like this were to happen we'd be able to get out.
###1287 My house, it's been a great place to
###1288 live but I bought 50 acres, it's about
###1292 seven hours from here.
###1293 I feel that's the direction
###1295 that we ought to go.
###1296 Run for our lives, you know.
###1298 She's had to blindly jump off a cliff, you know,
###1303 to take the risk to come here to America.
###1305 Tatiana: I can't believe I came here to die.
###1311 You didn't tell me that before.
###1315 Brian is telling me a little about it.
###1317 Like, because things that are happening here
###1321 in your country, you know you're afraid that,
###1326 war is coming.
###1328 When Brian told me he was a prepper,
###1330 I thought that he was crazy.
###1335 In Colombia we don't do it.
###1337 It's like a new concept for us.
###1339 We don't know about saving food for the bad times,
###1342 you know because there are bad times
###1344 all the time over there I guess.
###1347 But when I marry Brian I will become a prepper
###1349 because I will support him in whatever he's up to.
###1353 He's very wise.
###1354 I will be the perfect prepper one day.
###1360 I hope.
###1364 <i> Narrator: Fearing a  nuclear attack on the</i>
###1366 <i> heart of Boston, Brian  believes that he and</i>
###1368 <i> Tatiana must be  able to bug-out and</i>
###1371 <i> head for his land at  a moment's notice.</i>
###1375 <i> So before Tatiana has even  unpacked her suitcase,</i>
###1378 <i> he wants her to  prepare a bug-out bag</i>
###1381 <i> free of any  extraneous luxuries.</i>
###1385 Brian: We'll ease into it.
###1387 We'll go through your stuff,
###1388 you know and kinda get an idea of what's good
###1391 and what's not, you know.
###1392 Did you bring a lot of stuff?
###1397 Got all mangled up, huh?
###1398 Tatiana: My creams, lotions.
###1400 Brian: Oh boy.
###1401 Baby, what are these honestly?
###1404 These are beautiful shoes for going out on the town
###1406 but ah, if, if we really had to bug-out and
###1411 get out of town and we had to move quick,
###1413 do you think this is, I say that
###1417 with all due respect.
###1419 I'm trying to, you know, get you to think.
###1421 Tatiana: See now you're scaring me.
###1424 I came to America 'cause this is a safe place
###1427 and now we have to run away.
###1428 Brian: I know, it's funny.
###1429 Tatiana: I don't know it's very emotional because,
###1433 you know I'm like nobody here.
###1436 I can't go outside, I don't have a job.
###1439 I don't have friends here.
###1441 It's sad because I'm leaving everything,
###1443 you know and I'm starting like a baby.
###1446 I tell Brian, you have to teach me everything,
###1449 like I don't know many things here.
###1454 And I'm leaving my family and my mom,
###1457 my daughter, my dad and that is hard.
###1460 You know?
###1463 Will I be allowed to have a razor?
###1465 Brian: Will you be allowed to have a razor?
###1467 Of course.
###1468 Why wouldn't you be?
###1471 Some aspects of her adjustment to America
###1473 that are going to be tough for her.
###1474 Even though Tatiana is unaware of it right now.
###1477 Time will reveal to her that she is a prepper.
###1480 <i> Narrator: Before she's  even had a chance to</i>
###1482 <i> absorb the shock, Brian  wants to see how much</i>
###1484 <i> natural prepper instinct  Tatiana possesses</i>
###1487 <i> and how much he'll  have to teach her.</i>
###1490 Brian: I think it's very important to teach her
###1492 necessary skills to protect us.
###1494 <i> Narrator: So, just  hours after she arrived,</i>
###1497 <i> he's decided to put  Tatiana through her first</i>
###1500 <i> full-fledged  bug-out drill.</i>
###1502 <i> But is Tatiana really  ready to accept</i>
###1505 <i> the life of a doomsday  prepper wife?</i>
###1507 Brian: What are you just going to wait inside?
###1508 Tatiana: Yes, thank you.
###1513 <i> Narrator: Brian Murdock  believes the world is on</i>
###1515 <i> the brink of  nuclear war.</i>
###1517 <i> He's purchased 50 acres  of land 375 miles away in</i>
###1522 <i> upstate New York and an  RV and plans to bug-out</i>
###1525 <i> there as soon  as possible.</i>
###1528 <i> But Brian believes it's  essential his fiancée,</i>
###1530 <i> Tatiana, has all  the prepper basics</i>
###1533 <i> down pat first.</i>
###1535 <i> So even though she's only  just arrived in the U.S.,</i>
###1539 <i> it's already time for her  to leave Somerville behind</i>
###1542 <i> and experience her  first bug-out drill.</i>
###1546 Brian: Let's bug-out.
###1547 We're getting out of here.
###1548 Come on.
###1549 We're bugging out.
###1549 Let's go, babe.
###1555 Tatiana: My sandal.
###1556 Brian: I got it.
###1557 I got.
###1558 Tatiana: My sandal.
###1559 Brian: Don't worry about it.
###1561 You're not going to need that where we're going.
###1570 <i> Narrator: Brian's RV will  operate both as a home</i>
###1573 <i> and a defense outpost  for the couple.</i>
###1577 <i> He expects Tatiana will  learn to use firearms and</i>
###1580 <i> guard the 30  days of food and</i>
###1582 <i> water he keeps  in the RV.</i>
###1584 Brian: So babe now that we're here at the land,
###1585 I'll be teaching you how to keep
###1587 the perimeter safe.
###1589 And you're going to have the opportunity
###1591 to fire your first handgun.
###1593 Get you comfortable with a firearm,
###1595 we'll work our way into uh working on the perimeter.
###1597 This is better than the living room isn't it?
###1599 You feeling comfortable here?
###1602 Tatiana: I have to see how it goes.
###1606 And I will tell you how I feel.
###1608 Brian: I understand.
###1609 Tatiana: Let's see if the bugs leave me alone here.
###1614 Brian: The bugs like light skin,
###1617 so I think you'll be okay.
###1620 Tatiana: Yeah right now the bugs are bothering me.
###1622 I need to get out of here right now.
###1624 Meet you inside.
###1626 Brian: You're just going to leave me
###1627 out here like that?
###1628 Don't you think we're going to need to get
###1629 used to this if we're gonna live up here?
###1631 Tatiana: Let's see what happens.
###1634 Brian: Well, I understand.
###1638 But this is, this is the North Country.
###1640 This is God's country up here.
###1642 You know?
###1643 There's a lot of bugs.
###1644 I've got bug spray.
###1645 Tatiana: Okay, I will put on some.
###1647 Brian: What are you going to do?
###1648 Just wait inside?
###1649 Tatiana: Yes, thank you.
###1650 Brian: Ah, alright.
###1651 I'll get the fire going.
###1652 I'll get the uh venison on.
###1653 Tatiana: Okay.
###1654 Brian: All right?
###1655 Tatiana: Okay.
###1656 See you later.
###1657 Brian: Go to work on the beans and rice.
###1658 All right baby.
###1659 I love you.
###1660 Tatiana: I guess preppers are a little,
###1662 little bit crazy.
###1666 Don't get upset.
###1668 Brian: Tatiana's got a little learning to do,
###1671 but soon we'll be married and
###1673 I know we'll be happy here.
###1675 <i> Narrator: After a tough  initial adjustment,</i>
###1677 <i> Tatiana is ready for her  first shooting lesson.</i>
###1680 <i> One important advantage  of prepper partnering is</i>
###1683 <i> always having backup.</i>
###1685 <i> Just as World War II  soldiers were assigned to</i>
###1687 <i> defend trenches and  foxholes in pairs,</i>
###1690 <i> Brian believes it is  essential he and Tatiana</i>
###1692 <i> are both able to  defend the RV.</i>
###1695 <i> So today, he's teaching  her to shoot a handgun for</i>
###1698 <i> the first time.</i>
###1700 Brian: So as you know, this is an important part
###1702 of our prepping and central to the blessings
###1705 of being an American and the 2nd amendment.
###1706 I have a banana up there for you.
###1708 It was the closest I could come to a plantain.
###1710 I know you like plantains.
###1712 Want to give it a shot?
###1713 Tatiana: I will try.
###1715 Brian: Alright.
###1716 Tatiana: I don't want to offend anybody,
###1718 but it's a little bit arrogant to think that
###1723 you're gonna save yourself,
###1725 you know because I think if God wants you to you know,
###1732 that you're not alive anymore.
###1734 He will do it, no matter how many water,
###1737 how much water you have in your van or
###1740 in your camper or whatever.
###1742 I hope you know that everything I'm doing
###1747 it's because I love you.
###1748 And I want to share everything with you.
###1750 Your life and all your experiences prepping and
###1756 all that, because I love you.
###1758 Brian: I appreciate that baby and I love you too.
###1760 Tatiana: Sometimes, I want to kill you.
###1763 Brian: I love you, too.
###1767 Tatiana has already been prepared to be a prepper,
###1772 she may not know it but I think she'll realize,
###1774 like, "Yeah Brian, you know, this makes sense.
###1777 This is who I am too."
###1780 It's a life-changing event when you meet the right
###1783 person to share your life with.
###1790 <i> Narrator: Brian,  the experts,</i>
###1792 <i> practical preppers,  commend you for moving</i>
###1794 <i> forward with your prepping  plan and securing a</i>
###1796 <i> bug-out location.</i>
###1798 <i> However, the remainder  of your preps could be</i>
###1801 <i> fatally inadequate.</i>
###1802 <i> Your food and water preps  are nowhere near basic</i>
###1805 <i> levels necessary for  long-term survival.</i>
###1808 Brian: A hundred percent on the money.
###1809 I mean, your thoughts, Tatiana?
###1813 Tatiana: Si.
###1815 <i> Narrator: Your  shelter situation</i>
###1816 <i> is slightly better.</i>
###1818 <i> Having a mobile  bug-out RV provides</i>
###1820 <i> shelter with  flexibility.</i>
###1823 Tatiana: Yeah, that's true.
###1824 <i> Narrator: To determine how  long you could initially</i>
###1826 <i> survive a catastrophe,  practical preppers has</i>
###1829 <i> scored your preps in five  categories of 20 points</i>
###1832 <i> each, for a total  possible score of 100.</i>
###1837 <i> Food: You should have  a hidden cache at your</i>
###1839 <i> bug-out location,  4 out of 20 points.</i>
###1843 <i> Water: 9 out  of 20 points.</i>
###1846 <i> Shelter: Having no  infrastructure at your</i>
###1849 <i> bug-out location will  limit your ability to</i>
###1851 <i> survive long-term,  11 out of 20 points.</i>
###1855 <i> Security: 8 out  of 20 points.</i>
###1859 <i> Your biggest advantage  is your mobile home,</i>
###1861 <i> which can provide  you with basic</i>
###1863 <i> shelter anywhere you go.</i>
###1865 <i> 11 x-factor points.</i>
###1867 <i> Overall, you earn 43 out  of 100 survival points.</i>
###1871 <i> You have eight weeks  initial survival time.</i>
###1874 Brian: Yeah, I'm glad you folks have been uh,
###1876 crystal clear honest about this.
###1878 It just reminds us of, you know,
###1881 the intensity with which we need to raise our game.
###1886 Tatiana and I have tied the knot and ah,
###1889 we are moving in three days to that location.
###1891 We are getting out.
###1892 Things have heated up in the world.
###1894 At that time, once we are at our destination,
###1896 we intend to aggressively add to our
###1898 food and water storage.
###1901 <i> Narrator: Since  the 1980's,</i>
###1903 <i> the world's  nuclear stockpile</i>
###1904 <i> has decreased 80%.</i>
###1906 <i> However, with more  countries now in</i>
###1908 <i> possession of  nuclear weapons,</i>
###1910 <i> the possibility of a  limited nuclear exchange</i>
###1913 <i> remains a concern.</i>
###1919 <i> While earthquakes are a  common fear in some parts</i>
###1922 <i> of the United States,  they're not generally a</i>
###1924 <i> concern in much  of the Midwest.</i>
###1927 <i> But Bryan and Lacey May  believe that if more</i>
###1929 <i> Midwesterners were  aware of the major,</i>
###1931 <i> active fault line  running through the</i>
###1933 <i> center of the country,  they'd be worried.</i>
###1936 Bryan: Everybody knows where the San Andreas
###1937 Fault line is but not a lot of people know
###1939 where the Madrid Fault line is.
###1942 We're preparing for the New Madrid earthquake
###1944 that would change the world as we know it.
###1951 Me and my wife, we prep.
###1953 We're a prepping family and
###1955 she's right there beside me.
###1957 Lacey: I think the male prepper is a stereotype.
###1962 I'm sure there's more women preppers out there.
###1964 Once I became a mother,
###1966 I definitely started to think about the future and
###1970 just having extra things that would be needed.
###1974 My nightmare is not having what I need
###1978 to provide to my child.
###1981 <i> Narrator: The highest  risk of earthquakes in</i>
###1982 <i> the U.S. outside the  west coast is along the</i>
###1985 <i> New Madrid Fault.</i>
###1987 <i> The fault runs 150 miles  from Illinois to Missouri.</i>
###1992 <i> There are more than  200 measured seismic</i>
###1995 <i> events along the  fault each year.</i>
###1997 <i> In 1811 and 1812, a series  of nearly 8.0 magnitude</i>
###2002 <i> earthquakes rocked the  New Madrid each one</i>
###2005 <i> roughly as powerful as  the 1906 earthquake</i>
###2008 <i> that destroyed  San Francisco.</i>
###2010 <i> In 1812, the  New Madrid area</i>
###2013 <i> was relatively  unpopulated.</i>
###2015 <i> Today, more than 10  million Americans live</i>
###2018 <i> within the fault zone.</i>
###2020 Bryan: We're talking about just major cities
###2022 being affected by this.
###2023 There will be no food inside the
###2025 grocery stores after three days.
###2027 So if no one has preps,
###2030 they would basically starve.
###2031 Lacey: People who don't plan wouldn't know
###2033 what to do and so they would be wreaking havoc
###2036 on what is left of society.
###2042 Bryan: If the Madrid was to happen today you would
###2045 have essentially an ocean running through
###2047 the middle of the United States that
###2049 was probably 100 to 200 miles wide.
###2052 Let me show you this.
###2053 This right here is showing the,
###2055 what would happen after a Madrid earthquake.
###2058 Louisiana's going to be underneath water.
###2060 So it's gonna stretch from there,
###2063 some of Mississippi's gonna be underwater.
###2065 Arkansas, it's gonna be cut in,
###2067 pretty much in half.
###2068 Missouri's got a smaller path of water going
###2070 through it but it goes all the way up to Illinois.
###2072 And up to us.
###2074 Lacey: And where do we sit on this map?
###2076 Bryan: We're gonna be, we're up here.
###2078 They're predicting about 7 million people
###2080 will be affected by this.
###2081 Seven million people panicked,
###2082 is not a good thing.
###2084 <i> Narrator: Bryan and Lacey  want to start prepping for</i>
###2086 <i> the catastrophic quake  and flood they fear</i>
###2089 <i> as much as they can.</i>
###2091 <i> They have income from the  car stereo shop they own,</i>
###2093 <i> but they currently  have no savings.</i>
###2096 <i> So in order to make more  money to afford the preps</i>
###2099 <i> they think they'll  need, Bryan and Lacey</i>
###2101 <i> have gone to extremes.</i>
###2106 <i> Narrator: Small business  owners living in Indiana,</i>
###2108 <i> Bryan and Lacey may are  preparing for a massive</i>
###2110 <i> earthquake they fear  will strike in the heart</i>
###2113 <i> of the U.S., tearing  the country in two.</i>
###2116 Bryan: If the Madrid Fault line was to hit,
###2118 we'd have to rethink how we got our goods across
###2120 the United States, because now we would have a
###2122 gigantic mass of water dividing the
###2125 United States.
###2126 There's gonna be no way to truck supplies in
###2128 from the Western half and most of our imports
###2130 come from California.
###2132 <i> Narrator: Their fears have  spurred them to try to</i>
###2134 <i> fill their home with  enough supplies to</i>
###2135 <i> one day ride out the  end of civilization.</i>
###2139 <i> But Bryan and Lacey  have no cash savings.</i>
###2142 Lacey: So how are we gonna get the things
###2145 we don't have?
###2146 That we don't have stocked up?
###2148 Bryan: We're gonna need to barter for items.
###2151 I believe bartering should be done a lot more.
###2153 Bartering pretty much built the world the way we
###2157 know it as right now and then we got sidetracked
###2160 with paper money with no backing.
###2163 <i> Narrator: Because he  believes the dollar is</i>
###2165 <i> failing, Bryan converts  the bulk of his money into</i>
###2168 <i> either silver or gold,  to use for bartering.</i>
###2171 Bryan: I mostly barter with silver.
###2172 Sometimes gold.
###2173 And I have it in all denominations from one
###2176 gram all the way up to ten-ounce bars.
###2180 Lacey: How much money do we have in silver?
###2184 Bryan: In silver we're right around
###2185 5 or $6,000 give or take.
###2188 I won't know exactly until I weigh it all up
###2190 and figure out the current price.
###2192 <i> Narrator: Today most coins  are made of nickel and</i>
###2195 <i> copper, but before 1965  a quarter was 90% silver.</i>
###2200 Brian: So, alright, here's $5.
###2203 <i> Narrator: An actual silver  quarter is worth $5 today.</i>
###2207 Bryan: Whenever I go to the bank and
###2208 get my change or through a drive through,
###2210 I always check all my coins to make sure,
###2212 see if any of it's silver.
###2213 <i> Narrator: Bryan has  been using his silver</i>
###2215 <i> stockpile to barter  for some big preps.</i>
###2219 Bryan: I've got about $700 worth of
###2221 solar panels here.
###2222 And the trade was about 23 and a half ounces of
###2225 silver in trade for these panels.
###2229 If the Madrid Fault Line was to hit we's
###2231 going back in the Stone Age for most of us.
###2234 You'd have to make power somehow.
###2236 We have these solar panels.
###2237 We also have a wind turbine.
###2239 <i> Narrator: Solar and wind  power are only effective</i>
###2241 <i> on sunny and windy days,  unless you have some way</i>
###2244 <i> of storing the  energy they create.</i>
###2246 <i> So Bryan has run wires to  his basement where he has</i>
###2250 <i> ganged together 40  batteries to store the</i>
###2252 <i> excess electricity from  his solar panels and</i>
###2254 <i> wind turbine.</i>
###2256 Bryan: We currently have 40 batteries
###2258 wired in parallel.
###2260 Each battery's 100 amp hours.
###2262 We would be able to live for maybe two weeks to a
###2265 month without any interruptions if we
###2268 had no sun or wind.
###2269 <i> Narrator: In his  basement safe room,</i>
###2271 <i> Bryan also stockpiles  other items for bartering.</i>
###2274 <i> Items like medication  and alcohol,</i>
###2277 <i> which he believes will  be rare and therefore</i>
###2279 <i> valuable after a  catastrophic earthquake.</i>
###2282 Bryan: I believe when the shelves go empty,
###2284 there will be a premium on alcohol as you will
###2287 not be able to find it anywhere.
###2289 I have taken the medicine from the pet store before
###2291 to treat my urinary tract infections or kidney
###2294 infections and they've worked out excellent.
###2296 <i> Narrator: If a New  Madrid earthquake</i>
###2298 <i> one day cuts supply  lines across America,</i>
###2300 <i> Bryan thinks people will  return to bartering</i>
###2303 <i> for the vital  supplies they need.</i>
###2307 <i> But right now, Bryan and  Lacey need to develop</i>
###2310 <i> other sources of income  in order to be able to</i>
###2312 <i> continue prepping  for doomsday.</i>
###2315 <i> So in addition to  their auto shop,</i>
###2317 <i> they breed and sell  bearded dragons.</i>
###2320 Lacey: Bearded dragons, depending on what color
###2323 phase they are, can sell anywhere
###2326 from $25 up to $250.
###2330 <i> Narrator: And they  run an adult website.</i>
###2333 Lacey: When Bryan first came to me with the idea
###2336 for an adult website, I thought it was a good idea
###2340 because at the time I had a friend that was selling
###2344 bachelorette accessories and things like that
###2346 and she was making tons of money.
###2347 Everybody's always going to buy adult toys no
###2350 matter what type of, you know,
###2351 what the economy's at.
###2353 <i> Narrator: With  this added income,</i>
###2355 <i> Bryan and Lacey have  turned their basement into</i>
###2357 <i> a prepper pantry, stocked  with enough food to feed a</i>
###2360 <i> family of four  for four years.</i>
###2363 Bryan: FEMA says you should have a three-day
###2365 supply of food.
###2366 We got over 1,400 days of food.
###2369 On all our preps combined I would say we probably
###2371 have spent $60,000 to $75,000.
###2375 Any amount of money is important,
###2377 no matter what the amount is,
###2379 but for feeling safe and secure,
###2381 you cannot put a price on that.
###2383 <i> Narrator: Bryan and  Lacey are confident their</i>
###2385 <i> extensive home preps will  allow them to survive the</i>
###2388 <i> initial aftermath  of a catastrophic</i>
###2390 <i> New Madrid earthquake.</i>
###2392 <i> But they also believe  these same preps will make</i>
###2395 <i> them prime targets for  the millions of people</i>
###2397 <i> expected to be displaced.</i>
###2399 <i> So Bryan has something  much bigger in mind,</i>
###2402 <i> something he believes  could mean the difference</i>
###2405 <i> between life and death.</i>
###2407 <i> Convincing its owner to  part with it, however,</i>
###2410 <i> might be a tougher  sell than usual.</i>
###2413 Dave: With delivery it's $2,900.
###2415 Bryan: That sounds good.
###2416 Are you willing to take any barter?
###2423 <i> Narrator: Bryan and Lacey  may are preparing for a</i>
###2425 <i> major earthquake along the  New Madrid fault line in</i>
###2428 <i> the central U.S., which  they believe will cause</i>
###2431 <i> major flooding  in the heartland,</i>
###2433 <i> displacing several  million people.</i>
###2436 <i> They've spent  more than $60,000</i>
###2438 <i> making their suburban  home self-sufficient,</i>
###2442 <i> but they're worried their  security cameras and</i>
###2444 <i> arsenal won't be enough  to protect them from the</i>
###2446 <i> millions of refugees  they fear will come</i>
###2448 <i> knocking after the  earthquake strikes.</i>
###2451 <i> So Bryan and Lacey's  current number one</i>
###2453 <i> priority is to  establish a secure,</i>
###2455 <i> secret bug-out  location.</i>
###2458 Lacey: We've thought about getting a shipping
###2460 container to actually bury in our backyard.
###2464 Bryan: A shipping container would be great
###2466 because it would be hidden underneath the ground.
###2468 So therefore we could basically bug-out
###2471 and not be seen.
###2472 Bryan: So you want to dig about a nine-foot hole and
###2475 connect it through either a basement or a sub-floor
###2477 and have one or more ways to get in or out of it.
###2480 <i> Narrator: Using shipping  containers as shelters and</i>
###2483 <i> emergency housing is  a growing industry.</i>
###2487 <i> In the event of  an earthquake,</i>
###2489 <i> a shipping container  is 100 times stronger</i>
###2492 <i> than a conventionally  designed home.</i>
###2497 Dave: It's all been repainted.
###2498 It's basically rust free.
###2500 It's got some added vents.
###2502 Bryan: Wow.
###2503 Dave: Hardwood floors.
###2504 Bryan: Boy.
###2505 That's great.
###2507 Dave: With the delivery it's $2,900.
###2509 Bryan: Do you want to do any bartering?
###2510 Dave: I'm open to whatever you got in mind.
###2512 What are you thinkin'?
###2514 Bryan: Well, I've got my older bug-out
###2515 vehicle and then I also have some gold.
###2517 Dave: Bug-out vehicle?
###2519 What does that mean?
###2521 Bryan: Well, a bug-out vehicle is a vehicle that
###2522 you would get out of Dodge with per se.
###2524 You know, something that's 4x4, you know,
###2527 something not low to the ground.
###2529 Dave: Can we take a look at it?
###2530 Bryan: Yes we can.
###2531 It's an older Explorer, but you know,
###2533 I figure worth a couple grand in barter.
###2536 Dave: Okay, I might want to hear it run and take it
###2538 for a ride, but I'm interested.
###2539 And then you're going to add some gold?
###2541 Bryan: Yes, we are.
###2543 These are 24-carat gold, one-gram bars.
###2546 Each one of them at current value
###2547 is about $50 apiece.
###2550 So we need, you know, enough to cover 900 or so.
###2554 There's the last one.
###2555 Dave: Perfect.
###2556 It's like a credit card but it's.
###2558 Bryan: Good anywhere, anywhere will take it.
###2561 Dave: Anywhere, any time.
###2562 Bryan: Exactly.
###2563 If people don't prep on their own,
###2565 when the time comes, the government does not have
###2568 the resources out there to help everybody.
###2571 That was proven in Katrina.
###2573 They basically put everybody in a stadium
###2576 and left 'em.
###2577 That kind of proves when something that big
###2579 and overwhelming happens,
###2581 that you're pretty much on your own.
###2585 <i> Narrator: Bryan,  the experts at</i>
###2587 <i> practical preppers have  assessed your preps.</i>
###2590 <i> You have enough ammo to  defend your family in a</i>
###2592 <i> crisis, but your  communications plan</i>
###2594 <i> is inadequate.</i>
###2596 <i> We recommend investing  in a HAM radio.</i>
###2598 Bryan: That is something we've already
###2600 been looking into buying already.
###2601 We're also trying to figure out ways to do
###2603 other means of communication other
###2604 than HAM as well.
###2606 <i> Narrator: We commend  your energy storage</i>
###2607 <i> capabilities and power  generation and your food</i>
###2610 <i> storage is exceptional,  you could feed your family</i>
###2613 <i> for more than a year.</i>
###2615 <i> But you need a  re-supply plan.</i>
###2617 Bryan: And that is something that we thought
###2618 about and we are going to be doing.
###2622 <i> Narrator: Practical  preppers has scored your</i>
###2624 <i> preps in five categories  of 20 points each.</i>
###2629 <i> Food: 15 out  of 20 points.</i>

###2635 <i> 16 out of 20 points.</i>
###2637 <i> Shelter: Your location in  an urban area is not ideal</i>
###2641 <i> for sustainability,  15 out of 20 points.</i>
###2644 <i> Security: 10 out  of 20 points.</i>
###2648 <i> Your biggest advantage is  your solar and wind power.</i>
###2651 <i> For this you receive  15 x-factor points.</i>
###2655 <i> Overall, you receive a  score of 71 out of 100.</i>
###2659 <i> You have an initial 13  months survival time.</i>
###2662 Bryan: I can live with that assessment, um,
###2664 there's always room for improvement.
###2669 Since National Geographic was here,
###2671 we've started breeding more and more dragons.
###2674 We've produced hundreds of babies since the show.
###2677 We also have done enhancements to
###2680 our rain catchment system.
###2681 Also, we've started a few websites for preparations
###2684 to sell different kinds of preparation products.
###2686 Thank you.
