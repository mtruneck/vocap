1
0:0:0,21 --> 0:0:5,129
w reheat is when organization is not a
poser but was in fact it's run by the


2
0:0:5,129 --> 0:0:7,46
mcmahon's and linda mcmahon


3
0:0:7,46 --> 0:0:9,8
ran for senate


4
0:0:9,8 --> 0:0:9,999
twice


5
0:0:9,999 --> 0:0:11,179
as a republican


6
0:0:11,179 --> 0:0:13,77
so you think they'd be pretty pro quo
begin but apparently


7
0:0:13,77 --> 0:0:17,49
in a bone to debate with the tea party
or they thought it was a good story line


8
0:0:17,49 --> 0:0:21,43
and uh... they got a new character that
was revealed last week


9
0:0:21,43 --> 0:0:23,5
jack's slacker


10
0:0:23,5 --> 0:0:25,31
and he's a tea party guy and his dad


11
0:0:25,31 --> 0:0:29,599
his at manager co real american phys ed
boulter


12
0:0:29,599 --> 0:0:33,29
and zeb coulter goes out there and talks
about you know


13
0:0:33,29 --> 0:0:35,269
t partylite principles


14
0:0:35,269 --> 0:0:37,63
the nelson said that uh...


15
0:0:37,63 --> 0:0:42,59
by he gets fan mail from rush limbaugh
glenn beck and alex jones


16
0:0:42,59 --> 0:0:46,65
outsourcing prop course the realities
alex is probably fuming about the


17
0:0:46,65 --> 0:0:49,98
conspiracy and obviously the rock chosen
the rockefellers of taken over to the


18
0:0:49,98 --> 0:0:52,149
beat of the all these things are obvious


19
0:0:52,149 --> 0:0:54,1
uh... anyway


20
0:0:54,1 --> 0:0:55,13
mandate


21
0:0:55,13 --> 0:0:58,12
so the conservative fans arm


22
0:0:58,12 --> 0:1:2,81
so melissa closely rates in the deputies
making a big mistake with this jack


23
0:1:2,81 --> 0:1:4,83
swagger storyline


24
0:1:4,83 --> 0:1:10,66
and then uh... marks god or rights in
amused by this


25
0:1:10,66 --> 0:1:15,45
for are you doing does them culture guy
a killer tea party saratoga angle


26
0:1:15,45 --> 0:1:17,25
this a lot of money


27
0:1:17,25 --> 0:1:20,34
military immediately for about a month
right


28
0:1:20,34 --> 0:1:23,72
during your guest i sound like they're
maker is i'm not like


29
0:1:23,72 --> 0:1:28,27
did they wait but data and


30
0:1:28,27 --> 0:1:29,94
that there is no favorite


31
0:1:29,94 --> 0:1:33,98
i see the w_b_ scrapping all over the
tea party right now with the jack


32
0:1:33,98 --> 0:1:40,12
swaggert jimmy not cool law definitely
select out teacup


33
0:1:40,12 --> 0:1:41,479
but here's what's my favorite


34
0:1:41,479 --> 0:1:45,37
with their handle sister bolger


35
0:1:45,37 --> 0:1:48,86
defense bloody the idea that they were
that's funny


36
0:1:48,86 --> 0:1:52,97
but they're checking pilot does arise
that would every where in that direction


37
0:1:52,97 --> 0:1:56,0
you met pads flatness while ago data


38
0:1:56,0 --> 0:1:58,35
liberal that was the bad guy


39
0:1:58,35 --> 0:1:59,95
and think that was funny too


40
0:1:59,95 --> 0:2:1,99
and by the way he's gonna be fighting


41
0:2:1,99 --> 0:2:4,92
jack swagger is alberto del rio


42
0:2:4,92 --> 0:2:7,21
are all heavyweight championship


43
0:2:7,21 --> 0:2:8,78
so the team for a guy


44
0:2:8,78 --> 0:2:10,579
against m_x_ kya


45
0:2:10,579 --> 0:2:12,51
come on house that not fun


46
0:2:12,51 --> 0:2:14,33
the matter with you guys that's fun
drama


47
0:2:14,33 --> 0:2:17,67
and you never know team forty guys maybe
your guide keep them asking guys as and


48
0:2:17,67 --> 0:2:20,36
then you guys can point out something
wrong


49
0:2:20,36 --> 0:2:28,349
the buses dog


50
0:2:28,349 --> 0:2:29,859
so are miss


51
0:2:29,859 --> 0:2:31,999
needlessly reminded us


52
0:2:31,999 --> 0:2:36,189
well john stossel than doctor david
initials


53
0:2:36,189 --> 0:2:39,819
these days wrestling inmates that their
faith which drives me crazy i don't


54
0:2:39,819 --> 0:2:42,309
think that your government


55
0:2:42,309 --> 0:2:45,12
like storylines what is this uh... soap
opera now


56
0:2:45,12 --> 0:2:46,82
all wrestling is the end


57
0:2:46,82 --> 0:2:50,509
in this poor or in print and interest as
well as the one out


58
0:2:50,509 --> 0:2:51,599
okay


59
0:2:51,599 --> 0:2:55,109
uh... everybody's lives is a drama new
store that's a site map in the old days


60
0:2:55,109 --> 0:2:58,509
we just saw solidity view that doctor
david the schultz


61
0:2:58,509 --> 0:3:0,919
uh... irish also still


62
0:3:0,919 --> 0:3:4,449
carrying out a storyline is singled
convincing


63
0:3:4,449 --> 0:3:8,769
what you have a good bit her the odds
are good that i would be a good one


64
0:3:8,769 --> 0:3:12,669
propelled only without the babbitt's
renewing it and apart from the camera


65
0:3:12,669 --> 0:3:18,29
related pretty redneck dot hearing any
part of the top didn't


66
0:3:18,29 --> 0:3:20,739
separate like that all you got


67
0:3:20,739 --> 0:3:24,79
so that's what you knew the interview
was going south


68
0:3:24,79 --> 0:3:28,849
antoine miller direction and he's
rednecks adhered ainit barricaded


69
0:3:28,849 --> 0:3:30,229
sadness


70
0:3:30,229 --> 0:3:33,15
and then what happened next was living
there


71
0:3:33,15 --> 0:3:34,419
i think it's a site


72
0:3:34,419 --> 0:3:37,79
today despite cut


73
0:3:37,79 --> 0:3:38,219
dot


74
0:3:38,219 --> 0:3:41,239
uh... what they are hardly at all but


75
0:3:41,239 --> 0:3:45,889
dot holder


76
0:3:45,889 --> 0:3:49,309
bulky six


77
0:3:49,309 --> 0:3:53,159
now that was terribly wrong of course it
is thrown out a wrestling and he's


78
0:3:53,159 --> 0:3:55,139
probably


79
0:3:55,139 --> 0:3:56,93
your grocery bags and


80
0:3:56,93 --> 0:3:59,609
thank you have a good day router worry
is right


81
0:3:59,609 --> 0:4:3,69
of and dr feel bad for john stossel


82
0:4:3,69 --> 0:4:6,919
and then he had to run away only goof
that i wasn't there


83
0:4:6,919 --> 0:4:10,749
and of course just levels are of course
it was fake except for that one e crazy


84
0:4:10,749 --> 0:4:12,839
mo moment from those schultz


85
0:4:12,839 --> 0:4:14,99
anil


86
0:4:14,99 --> 0:4:18,99
jericho multiple at at fault to this
that we've never shown any interest


87
0:4:18,99 --> 0:4:18,94
before


88
0:4:18,94 --> 0:4:22,83
voice also goes and gets in the bible
walters on it


89
0:4:22,83 --> 0:4:26,62
franchise tax had heard that this
happened here are not until i start that


90
0:4:26,62 --> 0:4:27,929
i


91
0:4:27,929 --> 0:4:31,189
realized the impact of this i'd hope
nobody thinks that this was part of your


92
0:4:31,189 --> 0:4:35,419
story you really weren't because i
understand


93
0:4:35,419 --> 0:4:39,539
all right now that it's been difficult
or you mostly just to watch it


94
0:4:39,539 --> 0:4:43,229
laptop power to protect their what part
of the left and it's just it just makes


95
0:4:43,229 --> 0:4:45,7
me mad armenian orion each year


96
0:4:45,7 --> 0:4:50,259
dr arthur the editor damage but probably
permanent lightyears works


97
0:4:50,259 --> 0:4:54,18
uh... winter a lot of fans of the time
of both of those buyers people talk live


98
0:4:54,18 --> 0:4:55,659
with her


99
0:4:55,659 --> 0:4:58,429
information p it's not about in


100
0:4:58,429 --> 0:5:2,559
and entertaining and then became very
clear and very their own unfortunately


101
0:5:2,559 --> 0:5:4,75
in your case in that part of it to him


102
0:5:4,75 --> 0:5:9,99
happy about it


103
0:5:9,99 --> 0:5:15,93
if it doesn't tell them having trouble
hearing which doctor doctor shields


104
0:5:15,93 --> 0:5:21,3
so the recipe just as a huge libertarian
guide now at very likely republican


105
0:5:21,3 --> 0:7:21,3
voter so im coarsely wrestles with the
republicans are on for a long time now
