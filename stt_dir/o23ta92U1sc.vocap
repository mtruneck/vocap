###12 CHRIS KOUTSIS: What's up, buddy?
###14 MIKE RUBENDALL: How you doing, pal?
###15 CHRIS KOUTSIS: It's going [INAUDIBLE].
###16 What's going on?
###16 MIKE RUBENDALL: How's everything, all right?
###17 CHRIS KOUTSIS: What's up, guys?
###18 How you doing?
###19 Hanging in there.
###20 MIKE RUBENDALL: We have to give them the tour.
###21 CHRIS KOUTSIS: Cool, yeah.
###24 MIKE RUBENDALL: They spent three and a half hours with
###26 Frank today.
###27 CHRIS KOUTSIS: Got some good stories?
###28 MIKE RUBENDALL: Yeah.
###29 I was just always intrigued and fascinated by tattoos.
###32 And it just suddenly popped into my head, and
###35 I had tunnel vision.
###37 That's all I wanted to do, that's all
###38 I could think about.
###39 And I called different tattoo shops and tried to figure out
###43 what approach I would take, or what avenue I would take, in
###46 order to learn the craft.
###49 And that's when I went into Da Vinci's and met Frank.
###55 This was Franks' first tattoo when he was 16 years old.
###59 He nailed it on that one.
###62 FRANK: He always carried himself very well.
###66 He was never a snot-nosed kid or disrespectful.
###70 He always introduces me as the guy that
###72 taught him how to tattoo.
###73 This is Frank, this is the guy that taught me
###75 everything I know.
###78 Shit.
###80 I'm one of the most important people on the planet.
###83 Seriously, think about it, you know what I mean?
###85 I taught one of the greatest tattooers of
###88 all time how to tattoo.
###92 Not too many people can say that.
###93 
###100 And he just walked in with his brother one day, it's like, he
###103 wants to get into this.
###104 And right away in my mind I'm like, OK, I got to get rid of
###108 this fucking brat.
###110 And I had gotten rid of people in the past by handing them a
###113 tattoo magazine and saying draw 20
###116 things out of this magazine.
###117 But this kid--
###118 if you know anything about Mike, you
###121 know he ain't a quitter.
###122 
###125 And that's the thing, like he just kept coming back.
###129 Maybe it was just easier to teach the guy than it was to
###131 get rid of him, you know?
###134 MIKE RUBENDALL: I went there, and he kind of blew me off.
###136 I came back, he's like, OK, you want to learn how to
###139 tattoo, take 10 drawings out of a tattoo magazine.
###142 Don't trace them, draw them, copy them,
###144 and bring them back.
###145 I guess it took me about a month to do 10 drawings.
###147 Brought those 10 back, and he made me do
###151 another 25 after that.
###152 He's like, all right--
###153 just kind of just pushing me off.
###156 JOE PAPPALARDO, JR.: The first time I remember him bringing
###159 up tattooing, I think we were in 11th or
###160 12th grade art class.
###161 He asked the teacher, I want to apprentice at the shop,
###164 they want me to draw 20 of these, can I spend my time in
###166 class redrawing these?
###168 And she was fine with it, she said yes.
###169 And I think that's how he started.
###171 FRANK: Nobody's very good when they first come in.
###174 What he had that was apparent was tenacity.
###178 That's probably more important than being a good artist.
###182 In fact, if he was too good I might have felt threatened and
###184 told him you don't have what it takes.
###187 You should probably go home and stay home, or somebody
###190 might beat the fucking shit out of you.
###192 
###196 MIKE RUBENDALL: This was all the flash I had to trace.
###198 MALE SPEAKER: Did you trace that sheet?
###200 MIKE RUBENDALL: I traced that sheet a couple times.
###201 Some Mr. Miyagi shit.
###203 FRANK: The guy had an uphill battle from Jump Street.
###207 I wasn't going to be convinced that he really wanted it until
###213 I couldn't shake him.
###214 I just kept putting more and more hurdles in front of him,
###217 making the hurdles higher, making them closer together,
###221 making it harder and harder for him.
###223 Because really all of that, all of the beginning part of
###227 the apprenticeship, is not to teach him anything--
###231 it's to teach me something.
###234 How far can I push this guy away and have him still come
###238 back, because that tells me he really wants it.
###242 MIKE RUBENDALL: I think that was Frank's '55, but it's
###247 souped up there.
###247 That's the one I was in the trunk.
###250 That's the one we would take to Coney
###252 Island High on St. Mark's.
###253 
###256 He would make me wash his car in the back, and he had like
###259 nine cars at one time.
###260 And then I would finish one and then he would bring
###263 another one by.
###264 Because he lived locally, so he would go, grab another car,
###267 bring it back, I would wash it and wax it.
###270 Oh man, what does this have to do with tattooing?
###273 MALE SPEAKER: What were some of your favorite activities to
###275 have Mike as an apprentice do?
###277 FRANK: Anything that would humiliate him
###279 and break him down.
###281 I don't remember laying a hand on him.
###284 I really don't.
###285 MALE SPEAKER: He said one time you guys were just going punch
###287 for punch, I think.
###287 FRANK: Me and him?
###288 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###289 FRANK: I mean, I definitely remember people getting
###293 hog-tied with lamp cords and stuff.
###296 That I clearly remember.
###298 I don't know who did it, but I do remember that happening.
###300 I remember people being put in the trunk of cars--
###304 people got broken down.
###305 It's the same theory that the military uses, break them down
###309 and build them up.
###311 Strip them down, strip them down to nothing.
###314 And then build a better machine.
###316 
###320 MIKE RUBENDALL: I just accepted this is how you get
###323 into it, you just keep dealing with the bullshit.
###326 I didn't really think much about it.
###327 I just accepted the fact that this is what I need to do to
###330 get my foot in the door and learn how to tattoo.
###333 
###336 His mentality was tough love, so he put me through a pretty
###341 rigorous process.
###343 At times I didn't think I was going to make it, and I
###347 thought I would have a nervous breakdown.
###349 I was 17 years old, so I was a kid.
###352 I didn't know anything about life, I
###354 hadn't traveled anywhere.
###356 And then I meet this maniac, and he's leading the way.
###362 He grew up tattooing, fighting, drinking.
###367 He was like the epitome of an old-school tattooer.
###372 He was around when it counted.
###374 He's one of those guys that when you meet him, you're like
###377 wow, they don't make guys like this anymore.
###380 And you're just happy to have the experience with him.
###383 FRANK: And he's like young, and he's full of energy, and
###386 buying tattoo magazines.
###388 He's a sponge, and I'm from a whole different thing.
###392 It's like if you're an old school Italian and somebody's
###396 trying to teach you French cooking, it's a hard thing,
###400 I'm sure, to do.
###403 At the time, he's looking at all this stuff, and he's
###406 asking me a million questions.
###408 And it's probably very difficult for me to be into
###414 talking about that shit.
###415 Because I'm like fuck him, and fuck him, and this guy sucks,
###417 look at that thing.
###418 And then bingo, he sees Filip Leu's work, and it's like he's
###427 stepping over my clipboard, can't get out
###429 the door fast enough.
###430 Like, I need to see more of this.
###434 And then he's telling me, he's like I want to go to
###438 Switzerland.
###439 That was mind blowing.
###443 I think I was like, I don't know if you can go to
###446 Switzerland, you know?
###447 JOE PAPPALARDO, JR.: Give us the guided tour, why not?
###450 This is the best part right here, this window.
###454 Here on the third floor.
###455 
###459 So Mike always knew I was interested in traveling, and
###461 when he made his appointment with Filip he just asked me if
###464 I wanted to go.
###464 And I think we went there for four days or five days.
###467 I just went for a good time, and that's what we had.
###470 MIKE RUBENDALL: Filip is a tattooer from Switzerland.
###474 And at the time I had to contact him, but he didn't
###477 have a telephone, and there was no email back than.
###479 So I would write him letters, trying to get an appointment.
###481 And I would receive these beautiful handwritten letters
###485 back from his wife Titine.
###488 And she explained what I would have to do as far as deposits,
###491 and how far he was booked out in advance.
###494 And it just opened my eyes up to a whole new world of how
###498 tattooing could be.
###501 Da Vinci's was like war, and fucking motorcycles, hot rods,
###509 ass-kickings, drinking, fighting.
###512 And this was like peace, love, happiness.
###514 
###517 Between staying at his house and being at the studio, he
###521 just breathed and lived tattooing and art, and the
###525 whole family was involved.
###527 He took a very smart approach.
###529 Like everything was very well prepared.
###531 His color study, his composition, just everything
###535 had a really particular look that I was always drawn to.
###538 He had this ability to work with the human body.
###542 And every tattoo he did it seemed to look like people
###544 were born with the tattoos, like they
###546 were meant to be there.
###547 
###552 JOE PAPPALARDO, JR.: It was like the weirdest thing ever,
###554 but it was awesome, it was so much fun.
###555 Felix's dad was there, walking around, smoking joints,
###559 talking to Filip's wife, Titine.
###560 She was doing all these portraits and paintings that
###562 she was showing us.
###563 Mike got tattooed, I think, and then we'd go out.
###567 Tonight is Saturday night, and viva la Switzerland.
###569 And we're going to what they like to call here as a
###572 discotheque.
###574 And it was like Filip wouldn't come out, he's very low-key,
###578 and Titine would come out with us.
###580 We would just go out, it was like a club or a disco.
###582 And we were just drinking and having a good time.
###584 MIKE RUBENDALL: You think you have that suit downstairs?
###586 You could throw it on and still roll around Long Island?
###589 
###591 Oh, man.
###592 CHRIS O'DONNELL: Mike was very young, and he hadn't been in
###595 the tattoo industry for any really length of time before
###599 he went to Filip Leu to get tattooed.
###600 But that was pretty unique.
###601 Most people don't fly to Switzerland to get tattooed
###605 when they're, whatever, 18.
###606 And that was a good indicator that he had a understanding of
###610 what was going on, what was good, by
###612 going to Filip so young.
###613 
###616 FRANK: The exposure to Filip took him to another level,
###620 both desire-wise and knowledge-wise.
###624 I'm sure he was watching Filip like a hawk.
###627 I'm sure he didn't feel 90% of that tattoo until spots were
###631 really bad, because he was just watching every move.
###634 MIKE RUBENDALL: The short time you stay there, it's almost
###637 like a Harvard education.
###638 You learn so much about tattooing in a
###640 short period of time.
###641 Filip has such an influence on and rubs off on you so easily.
###645 And constructs the ideas of tattooing in a very simplistic
###650 way that it makes an amateur tattooer understand it easily.
###656 CHRIS O'DONNELL: He was just hell-bent on getting good.
###659 I don't know how much of that was Frank, or the guys he
###663 worked with, or getting tattooed by people like Filip.
###666 But he was just really able to nail the whole technical side
###670 of it pretty quickly.
###671 MIKE RUBENDALL: That was a pinnacle moment for me.
###674 That changed my whole outlook.
###676 Even like technical aspects of it, I came back and tattooed
###680 completely different.
###681 Used different needles that I didn't know existed.
###684 It was a lot of shit that changed my life.
###689 FRANK: Filip brought Mike's ability to another level, his
###693 desire to do better.
###694 At that point, he's exhausted my capabilities.
###699 He's taking everything that I could have taught him, and
###702 he's maximized it.
###703 And now he needs to take another block and stack it on.
###706 
###711 MIKE RUBENDALL: It took the best of Frank, and took the
###714 best of me traveling the world, and kind of
###717 integrated each one.
###719 Both worlds collided, they contradicted each other.
###722 And some aspects of this style tattooing
###725 Frank would frown upon.
###726 He's like oh, that's pussy shit.
###727 
###735 But then--
###738 I don't know, we'll go back to that.
###740 MALE SPEAKER: That was awesome.
###741
