SIMON OSTROVSKY: We headed out
in the morning to see if we


5
0:0:15,15 --> 0:0:17,78
could find some Jewish outposts
in the West Bank,


6
0:0:17,78 --> 0:0:19,86
ones that were small,
unestablished, and


7
0:0:19,86 --> 0:0:21,1
unauthorized.


8
0:0:21,1 --> 0:0:24,2
We decided to drive to Havat
Gilad, which is known for


9
0:0:24,2 --> 0:0:27,16
having clashed with both its
Palestinian neighbors as well


10
0:0:27,16 --> 0:0:30,17
as the Israeli Police
force and the Army.


11
0:0:30,17 --> 0:0:31,48
Israel has a love/hate


12
0:0:31,48 --> 0:0:33,38
relationship with the settlers.


13
0:0:33,38 --> 0:0:36,99
Nearly 40% of Israelis think the
settlers shouldn't be in


14
0:0:36,99 --> 0:0:40,15
the West Bank, but their views
have never translated into


15
0:0:40,15 --> 0:0:41,37
government policy.


16
0:0:41,37 --> 0:0:43,99
And many blame this on the
influence of extremist


17
0:0:43,99 --> 0:0:46,59
religious parties who believe
that the Palestinian


18
0:0:46,59 --> 0:0:50,9
territories were promised
to them by God.


19
0:0:50,9 --> 0:0:53,5
Israel's prime minister says he
wants a two-state solution,


20
0:0:53,5 --> 0:0:55,75
but he's never actually said
he wants to evacuate the


21
0:0:55,75 --> 0:0:56,56
settlements.


22
0:0:56,56 --> 0:0:59,38
And although he recently broke
free of a coalition with the


23
0:0:59,38 --> 0:1:2,16
religious parties, he's still
a strong supporter of the


24
0:1:2,16 --> 0:1:4,3
settlement enterprise.

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU:
[SPEAKING HEBREW]


26
0:1:8,4 --> 0:1:10,28
TRANSLATOR: There is no
government that supports or


27
0:1:10,28 --> 0:1:14,53
will support settlements more
than the government I lead.


28
0:1:14,53 --> 0:1:16,93
SIMON OSTROVSKY: This means
Palestinians can expect more


29
0:1:16,93 --> 0:1:20,1
settler expansion and more
attention with the Israelis


30
0:1:20,1 --> 0:1:21,17
and their army.


31
0:1:21,17 --> 0:1:23,65
And on our way to the
settlement, we noticed a bit


32
0:1:23,65 --> 0:1:26,65
of a commotion involving a bunch
of Palestinians and some


33
0:1:26,65 --> 0:1:28,54
Israeli soldiers.


34
0:1:28,54 --> 0:1:29,96
We saw off to the side of
the road this group of


35
0:1:29,96 --> 0:1:33,6
Palestinians, but they're being
watched over by Israeli


36
0:1:33,6 --> 0:1:34,7
security forces.


37
0:1:34,7 --> 0:1:36,65
So we're wondering what's
going on here.

MALE SPEAKER:

39
0:1:37,9 --> 0:1:58,48



40
0:1:58,48 --> 0:2:0,85
SIMON OSTROVSKY: It turns out
Israel had mobilized its army


41
0:2:0,85 --> 0:2:2,79
to allow an Israeli
archaeological


42
0:2:2,79 --> 0:2:4,325
team to dig up a field.


43
0:2:4,325 --> 0:2:7,55
The Palestinian villagers
weren't happy because they saw


44
0:2:7,55 --> 0:2:9,88
it as the first step in the
expansion of a nearby


45
0:2:9,88 --> 0:2:10,94
settlement.


46
0:2:10,94 --> 0:2:13,86
This is totally crazy because
this is an archaeological dig


47
0:2:13,86 --> 0:2:15,36
being carried out
by the Israeli


48
0:2:15,36 --> 0:2:17,12
authorities in the West Bank.


49
0:2:17,12 --> 0:2:20,11
And this is how many soldiers
you need in order to protect


50
0:2:20,11 --> 0:2:22,54
this archaeological
excavation.


51
0:2:22,54 --> 0:2:25,23
But what's even more nuts is
that Palestinians are doing


52
0:2:25,23 --> 0:2:26,15
the manual labor.


53
0:2:26,15 --> 0:2:29,31
So the Israelis have hired
Palestinians to do an illegal


54
0:2:29,31 --> 0:2:31,6
excavation in the Palestinian
territories.


55
0:2:31,6 --> 0:2:32,986
MALE SPEAKER:


56

57
0:3:4,41 --> 0:3:5,43
SIMON OSTROVSKY: What
is this place?


58
0:3:5,43 --> 0:3:9,64
What is the significance
of this site?


59
0:3:9,64 --> 0:3:12,39
But they're on the wrong side
of the green line for doing


60
0:3:12,39 --> 0:3:14,55
archaeological digs.


61
0:3:14,55 --> 0:3:15,41
No?


62
0:3:15,41 --> 0:3:17,25
I mean I'm just asking
if that's correct.


63
0:3:17,25 --> 0:3:19,91
MALE SPEAKER:


64
0:3:19,91 --> 0:3:20,81
SIMON OSTROVSKY: I don't know.


65
0:3:20,81 --> 0:3:21,99
I don't know.


66
0:3:21,99 --> 0:3:24,3
MALE SPEAKER: No
picture today.


67
0:3:24,3 --> 0:3:26,35
SIMON OSTROVSKY: So the soldiers
really didn't want me


68
0:3:26,35 --> 0:3:28,94
to talk to the Palestinians who
are apparently upset about


69
0:3:28,94 --> 0:3:31,83
this archaeological dig
taking place here.


70
0:3:31,83 --> 0:3:34,19
And the reason they're upset is
because a lot of times when


71
0:3:34,19 --> 0:3:36,94
the Israelis do an
archaeological dig, they then


72
0:3:36,94 --> 0:3:40,4
build a sort of memorial around
any Jewish artifacts


73
0:3:40,4 --> 0:3:40,69
that they find.


74
0:3:40,69 --> 0:3:43,23
And it becomes a place of
pilgrimage for the settlers


75
0:3:43,23 --> 0:3:43,9
who come here.


76
0:3:43,9 --> 0:3:47,3
And then, bit by bit, the
Palestinians feel that they're


77
0:3:47,3 --> 0:3:48,42
losing even more land.


78
0:3:48,42 --> 0:3:51,34
It turns out the guy who was
leading the excavation, and


79
0:3:51,34 --> 0:3:54,86
who casually shrugged us off,
was Michael Ben-Ari, an


80
0:3:54,86 --> 0:3:57,86
ultra-right member of Israel's
parliament who lived in the


81
0:3:57,86 --> 0:3:59,67
settlement across the road.


82
0:3:59,67 --> 0:4:2,92
And Ben-Ari had a history of
questionable behavior.


83
0:4:2,92 --> 0:4:6,4
Besides openly advocating for
the departure of Palestinians


84
0:4:6,4 --> 0:4:8,9
from the West Bank, the US
refused to grant him a


85
0:4:8,9 --> 0:4:11,6
visitor's visa because he'd
been included on the State


86
0:4:11,6 --> 0:4:14,2
Department's Terrorist
Watch List.


87
0:4:14,2 --> 0:4:16,744
Oh, and he's also been known to
post heartwarming photos on


88
0:4:16,744 --> 0:4:19,57
his Facebook page, like this
one, which shows him and a


89
0:4:19,57 --> 0:4:22,99
buddy relaxing on a couch
confiscated from an Arab


90
0:4:22,99 --> 0:4:26,62
family that had just been
evicted from their home.


91
0:4:26,62 --> 0:4:29,2
Unfortunately, the soldiers
were pressuring us


92
0:4:29,2 --> 0:4:30,21
to leave the site.


93
0:4:30,21 --> 0:4:33,15
So we got back on the road and
continued our trek to Havat


94
0:4:33,15 --> 0:4:35,4
Gilad, which is known
for attracting


95
0:4:35,4 --> 0:4:36,55
its own set of problems.


96
0:4:36,55 --> 0:4:39,86
Besides it being a hot spot for
violence, Israel is known


97
0:4:39,86 --> 0:4:41,83
to come in and routinely
bulldoze


98
0:4:41,83 --> 0:4:43,42
these illegal outposts.


99
0:4:43,42 --> 0:4:46,7
But the settlers are always more
than happy to rebuild.


100
0:4:46,7 --> 0:4:49,53
So we were curious to see what
shape the place was in.


101
0:4:49,53 --> 0:4:52,9
When we arrived, we came upon
two teenagers who were


102
0:4:52,9 --> 0:4:53,8
building a house from
the ground up.
