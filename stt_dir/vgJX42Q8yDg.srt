Hey, everybody.

I'm just getting ready for a
little Tabletop Day action.

0:0:4,16 --> 0:0:5,0
What are you guys doing?

0:0:6,4 --> 0:0:6,84
You making cupcakes?

0:0:6,84 --> 0:0:7,43
You ordering pizza?


8
0:0:7,43 --> 0:0:8,258
What's going on?


9
0:0:8,258 --> 0:0:10,662
Did you organize your dice
collection by color?


10
0:0:10,662 --> 0:0:11,646
Hey, it's a thing.


11
0:0:11,646 --> 0:0:14,96

Day is happening this

This [BLEEP]


21
0:0:30,995 --> 0:0:31,93
is real.


22
0:0:31,93 --> 0:0:35,142

26
0:0:40,75 --> 0:0:42,3

0:0:42,3 --> 0:0:43,46
We're going to be having
so much fun.


28
0:0:43,46 --> 0:0:45,11
So you can tune in between,
you know,


29
0:0:45,11 --> 0:0:47,8
setting up all your games.


30
0:0:47,8 --> 0:0:49,81
Also, do not forget to take
pictures and make videos of


31
0:0:49,81 --> 0:0:52,43
everything you guys are doing,
and share it with the hash tag


32
0:0:52,43 --> 0:0:53,17
#Tabletopday.


33
0:0:53,17 --> 0:0:55,36
We want everybody to be aware of
this day, so that it lives


34
0:0:55,36 --> 0:0:56,5
in eternity.


35
0:0:56,5 --> 0:0:59,49
But also we want to find it,
so we can put your stuff in


36
0:0:59,49 --> 0:1:0,99
our wrap-up video at the end.


37
0:1:0,99 --> 0:1:3,2
Thanks, everybody, for making
this event so huge.


38
0:1:3,2 --> 0:1:5,94
