###128 MALE SPEAKER: If it got out of hand-- like if the guy had
###129 gotten through Tony and--
###131 ALEX OLSON: Yeah.
###132 Well then if he'd gotten through those guys, I'm just
###135 basically a shield for someone else to throw him at.

###214 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, is this our only chance to skate this?
###216 Can I sleep?
###217 
###247 MALE SPEAKER: Most skaters--
###249 they'll have to warm up.
###250 He's completely opposite--
###253 gets out of the car, does the craziest or hardest shit, and
###257 then is over it, like done.
###261 JOHN ALDEN: That was fucking psycho.
###262 The first one he did, his tail drug around on the chain link
###266 and was like duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
###269 It was so sick.

###274 And then he's fucking chilling for a bit.
###277 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###277 It's almost like you watch those parts.
###278 And you don't realize that it was all just first try.
###281 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, all that shit is
###282 straight out of the van.
###283 Pretty much, dude.
###284 He's fucking insane with it like that.
###287 
###291 MALE SPEAKER: Oh my--
###293 [CHEERING]
###298 MALE SPEAKER: I mean, that's how good he is.
###299 He just can go and do the hardest line or, like, highest
###304 air, or weirdest area of the park and then, like, sit down
###310 and drink a beer and be Tony.
###314 ROBBIE RUSSO: Look at that thing.
###315 That thing is huge.
###317 I wouldn't even roll into that.
###319 
###326 [CHEERING]
###328 
###338 MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
###339 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, good.

###344 STU GRAHAM: Aye.
###344 It's a funny color.
###345 And it blends in, man.

###398 
###407 MALE SPEAKER: Hey, did you ever skate with
###408 Peter Hewitt before?
###408 MALE SPEAKER: No.
###409 I never even seen him.
###410 MALE SPEAKER: And you know when you are a kid.
###411 And you see these skaters.
###412 And you trip out how they look.
###415 Because you see them in magazines.
###417 And then you actually see them in person.
###419 And they kind of look a little different than you thought
###421 they would look.
###422 I was all--
###423 I would, like, stare at them.
###424 And like, I don't know.
###427 Like, the dude skates the most big stuff that no
###432 one else can skate.
###433 Like a mini ramp to him is like a fucking
###436 vert ramp for us.
###440 MALE SPEAKER: You mean the other way around.
###440 MALE SPEAKER: Was that what I--?
###441 MALE SPEAKER: You mean a vert ramp for him is a--
###443 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah, yeah.

###454 these Girl guys with that team?
###456 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, it's nice, man.
###459 I've known most of them for, like, 20 plus years.
###461 And I've never actually been on a skate
###462 trip with any of them.
###463 So that's nice.
###465 These guys--
###465 we've all been skating for so long together.
###468 It's the same world.
###470 
###476 PRESTON MAIGETTER: Yeah, Petey.
###478 It's coming.
###479 Next one, Pat, next one.
###482 PETER TRUJILLO: I was taking it short.
###483 MALE SPEAKER: I thought you were going to make it.
###484 PETER TRUJILLO: And then I took it long that time.
###484 It worked.
###486 Yes.
###488 I sketched on the push in.
###490 PRESTON MAIGETTER: They did.
###491 PETER TRUJILLO: Yeah.
###491 PRESTON MAIGETTER: Saw that a little bit there.
###493 PETER TRUJILLO: Yeah.
###493 PRESTON MAIGETTER: All right.
###494 We've got to get ready.
###494 Because Petey's going to get back in there, Pat.
###497 PAT: What's he going to do?
###498 PRESTON MAIGETTER: Yo, you're going to see.
###499 Because he doesn't tell you.
###500 He just starts trying something.
###501 And it'll happen.
###504 You've got to be ready for him to skate.
###506 PAT: What's that?
###506 PRESTON MAIGETTER: I feel like how you're kind of ill
###508 prepared with the tape and the battery last three minutes.
###511 Usually you put a fresh tape in when
###513 Peter Trujillo is skating.
###514 
###524 [CHEERING]
###530 PRESTON MAIGETTER: I told you, Pat.
###530 You got to be ready.
###532 Did you get that?
###534 PAT: Yeah.
###535 PRESTON MAIGETTER: So we don't need to send you that clip?
###537 
###541 MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
###542 How did you first meet Julian?
###544 MALE SPEAKER: We partied at one and the Anti-Hero team.
###546 MALE SPEAKER: Ah, the Hellride Crew, I met when I was 21.
###549 We went to Australia together.
###551 Andy Roy invited me to go along.
###553 MALE SPEAKER: Did you feel like when you met those guys
###555 that that was something you wanted to skate for, or that
###558 was a crew you wanted to roll with?
###559 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###559 I definitely wanted to travel with these guys as much as
###562 possible and continue the saga.
###565 MALE SPEAKER: How'd that come about, that they asked you to
###567 ride for Anti-Hero?
###568 MALE SPEAKER: We were in Marseilles.
###570 And I was staying with John and Julian in their room.
###573 And they were like, we want to make this happen.
###575 But it's just going to take some time.
###578 And then a year later from that point, I was on the team.
###583 MALE SPEAKER: How is the experience of riding for
###585 Anti-Hero different than some of these other
###587 companies you rode for?
###587 MALE SPEAKER: Just we travel good together is the main
###590 thing, just being able to travel with your friends and
###594 have a good time.
###595 MALE SPEAKER: Have you been on camping trips
###597 with these dudes before?
###598 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.
###598 Yeah.
###599 That's how we've been doing it for a while.
###601 It's way better.
###601 Because you get to know people a lot better.
###604 Because you don't get to the hotel and you all just
###607 disperse off to your rooms and get locked away for the night.
###610 You know, you're there at the campsite, making food together
###615 and just telling stories.
###618 MALE SPEAKER: What kind of back patch did you have?
###620 MALE SPEAKER: I had a Saxon back patch back in the day.
###623 And I had an Iron Maiden Piece of Mine painters cap with on
###627 one flap had Def Leppard triangular patch
###633 on one of the flaps.
###634 FEMALE SPEAKER: Triangular mangular.
###635 MALE SPEAKER: Triangular.
###636 MALE SPEAKER: You should have brought it on this trip.
###638 MALE SPEAKER: I wish I had it.
###639 But I think it got stole.
###642 MALE SPEAKER: Look how Brogini this outfit is.
###645 FEMALE SPEAKER: He's about to swallow that wang whole.
###647 FRANK GERWER: Dude, I know.
###647 It's a hooded fucking sleeve.
###649 MALE SPEAKER: It's just sleeves and--
###649 MALE SPEAKER: Don't even bite my shit, dude.
###652 MALE SPEAKER: Brogini.
###652 That's our clothing company.
###653 FRANK GERWER: That might be the first--
###656 Yeah, whenever.
###656 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, anyway, where's the music at?
###659 Let's dance.
###660 FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm trying to do that.
###662 Baby boy, you got hickeys on your neck.
###665 You are so corrupted.
###667 You got one right there.
###668 And turn around.
###669 Turn around.
###670 You got one right there.
###671 ROBBIE RUSSO: Well.
###672 MALE SPEAKER: Where is it?
###674 How'd you get that?
###676 ROBBIE RUSSO: Twice my age.
###678 Twice my age.
###678 FEMALE SPEAKER: The girl who gave it to you is getting
###680 fucked in the woods.
###682 She's getting fucked in the woods.
###685 MALE SPEAKER: By what wood?
###687 FEMALE SPEAKER: By a little bit of wood.
###690 MALE SPEAKER: She's getting fucked in the
###691 woods by some wood.
###693 FEMALE SPEAKER: What kind of wood?
###694 MALE SPEAKER: Who's got wood?
###694 FEMALE SPEAKER: Is it hard wood?
###696 MALE SPEAKER: It's hard wood.
###697
