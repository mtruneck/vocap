###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: We`re celebrating a birthday today on CNN STUDENT NEWS, and we
###4 are sharing some of your thoughts on police officers using pushups as punishment. I`m
###9 Carl Azuz. It all starts right now.
###25 Football games often start with a coin toss and a national anthem. Sunday`s pregame ceremonies
###30 in Kansas City also included a moment of silence. The Kansas City Chiefs held the moment for
###35 the victims of domestic violence and their families. It`s an issue with an immediate
###39 connection to the Kansas City community and the Chiefs team. Jovan Belcher was a linebacker
###44 for Kansas City. Police reports say that on Saturday, Belcher shot and killed his girlfriend,
###49 Cassandra Perkins. He drove to the team`s practice facility where he then took his own
###54 life. When violence like this occurs, you might expect the issue of gun control to come
###58 up, you might not expect it to come up during a half-time show.
###62 And that`s what happened on Sunday night.
###64 NBC`s Bob Costas talked about it during the Sunday night football broadcast. He quoted
###69 another sports reporter, Jason Whitlock, whom Costas agreed with. Here is what he said,
###75 quote: "Our current gun culture ensures that more and more domestic disputes will end in
###79 the ultimate tragedy. Handguns do not enhance our safety. They tempt us to escalate arguments
###85 and bait us into embracing confrontation rather than avoiding it."
###89 Now, there was an immediate reaction to this online. It was not necessarily about gun control,
###94 it was about Costas discussing the issue during a sports program. One sports talk show host
###99 said, quote, "I will gladly debate Jason Whitlock and Bob Costas on gun control, but we tuned
###105 in for an NFL game! Ridiculous programming decision!"
###109 Another person on Twitter said, quote, "Big ups to Bob Costas for standing up for gun
###113 control. Hopefully, some day we can actually have a conversation about it as a nation."
###117 So, on our blog today we are tossing it to you to get your take. We are focusing on what
###122 Bob Costas did. Should he have weighed in on the issue of gun control during halftime,
###126 or was this an issue of a bad decision or bad timing? We are looking for your thoughts

###132 U.S. government is getting closer to the edge of the fiscal cliff. Congress and the president
###138 have until January 1 to agree on the plan to lower the country`s debt. That could include
###143 how the government takes in money through taxes and how it spends money. If they don`t
###147 come up with the deal, we know that taxes will go up for all Americans, and government
###151 spending will also get cut. Ted Rowlands looks at what that might mean for one city.
###156 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###157 TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: First and foremost, there`s the Rock Island Arsenal.
###161 If Congress doesn`t act, defense spending will be slashed by 55 billion next year and
###167 450 billion over ten years. Which many fear could put the Arsenal in jeopardy. The Arsenal
###172 is the area`s largest employer. And though it`s not clear how any cuts would impact the
###177 installation specifically, the mere prospect has people worried.
###183 Next, is healthcare, another major employer in the quad cities. If Congress doesn`t act,
###189 Medicare reimbursement will initially drop by two percent. Trinity Medical Center in
###194 Rock Island is already budgeting for the fiscal cliff.
###197 Other possible fiscal cliff cuts that could hit Rock Island include the Army Corps of
###202 Engineers. They are here in part to manage the locks along the Mississippi.
###206 There is cuts to public education, which the National School Board Association said could
###210 have a profound effect if Congress doesn`t act.
###213 And there are potential cuts to social services. More than 12 percent of Rock Island`s population
###219 lives below the poverty line. And of course, there are the tax hikes.
###225 At Theo`s coffee shop, people have a lot to say about Washington D.C. and the fiscal cliff.
###231 James Cheeks says he`s counting on Congress to prevent his taxes from going up.
###236 JAMES CHEEKS, CUSTOMER: Scary. You know, it`s scary. Where then money is going to come from?
###241 You know, how am I going to pay this extra tax hike?
###244 ROWLANDS: The potential effects of the fiscal cliff aren`t necessarily any more or less
###248 significant here in Rock Island than they would be in any other city across the country.
###253 The bottom line is, if Congress doesn`t act, there will be significant repercussions for
###258 the entire country. Ted Rowlands, CNN, Rock Island, Illinois.

###264 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to Mr. Lind`s social studies classes at
###267 Highland High School in Ault, Colorado.
###270 Which of these technologies is celebrating its 20th birthday this week? Here we go, is
###275 it the cell phone, artificial heart, DVD or text message?
###279 You`ve got three seconds, go!
###285 If you guessed the text message, you are right. The first one was sent 20 years ago this week.
###293 That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."
###295 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###298 AZUZ: The text of the first text message -- "Merry Christmas." The engineer was sending it to
###303 his boss who was at a Christmas party. What started as two words has exploded in the 2.2
###310 trillion texts. That`s how many are sent every year just in the U.S., so it works out to
###315 about 6 billion per day.
###318 Text messaging is slowing down a little bit. So, some analysts start wondering if it`ll
###322 BRB. But for a lot of people, especially you guys, it`s the most common form of communication.
###327 So, the idea of texting disappearing any time soon might just make you LOL.
###332 Well, the CNN Heroes program is all about honoring people who are making a difference.
###338 People like Malala Yousafzai. She`s the Pakistani teenager who was shot by the Taliban because
###344 of her support for girls` right to education in her home country. Malala is recovering
###349 from the attack and she has a message for her supporters.
###351 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###352 ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: "Thank you so much for the outpouring of love and support.
###357 I thank the people who supported me without distinguishing religion and color. People
###362 have actually supported a cause, not an individual. Let`s work together, she says. Let`s work
###368 together to educate girls around the world.
###370 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###371 AZUZ: Anderson Cooper read Malala`s message during Sunday night`s CNN Heroes All Star
###376 Tribute program. Now, Kareen Wynter recaps the night and tells us who was the 2012 CNN
###382 Hero of the Year.
###383 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###383 KAREEN WYNTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The red carpet outside L.A.`s Shrine Auditorium buzzed
###388 with excitement, but this time the bright lights shined on some special stars, everyday
###394 people changing the world.
###395 COOPER: Welcome to CNN Heroes, an All-Star Tribute
###398 WYNTER: Out of thousands of nominations submitted by CNN`s global audience, ten amazing men
###403 and women were singled out for their remarkable heroic efforts to make the world a better
###408 place. People like Razia Jan, who is providing a free education to hundreds of girls in rural
###415 Afghanistan.
###415 RAZIA JAN, "HEROES" HONOREE: I think education is the only thing in the world that can go
###420 forward and make life better.
###422 WYNTER: And Leo McCarthy, who gives scholarships to kids who pledge not to drink after his
###427 daughter was killed by a young driver.
###429 LEO MCCARTHY: Let`s change a culture and keep these promising, vibrant kids alive.
###435 WYNTER: Olympic swimmer Kolin Jones helped celebrate Wanda Butts golden moment. Motivated
###441 by her son`s tragic drowning, she created a non- profit that helped more than 1200 children
###447 learn how to swim.
###448 WANDA BUTTS, "HEROES" HONOREE: It is unbelievable to me that I have come this far from such
###453 a tragedy with my son.
###454 WYNTER: It was an unforgettable night capped off with the unveiling of the CNN Hero of
###460 the Year: Pushpa Basnet, founder of a Children`s Home in Nepal that helps kids whose parents
###467 are in prison.
###467 PUSHPA BASNET, CNN HERO OF THE YEAR: And thank you so much for everyone who brought it for
###470 me and who believed in my dream.
###471 WYNTER: The hope is that their heroic example will inspire countless others.
###482 Kareen Wynter, CNN, Los Angeles.
###484 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###486 AZUZ: Last week, we told you about some Rhode Island police officers who made a group of
###490 young people do pushups instead of arresting or reporting them for allegedly vandalizing
###495 a mailbox.
###496 On our blog, 75 percent of you sided with the police, saying, you supported the push-up
###501 punishment. Hannah wrote: "Although more could`ve been done to ensure the alleged vandalism
###505 wouldn`t happen again, it was a perfectly good punishment. Anybody would rather do push-ups
###510 than pay a fine.
###511 From Robbie, "The punishment would only be OK it if was a small, harmless crime, but
###515 it was a larger crime, it shouldn`t be an option."
###518 Christine says, "As much as a punishment was needed, it wasn`t up to the police officers
###523 themselves to decide what it would be."
###526 Mr. Mike`s juvenile detention class says "The police officers let the suspects off with
###530 a good warning as opposed to arresting them on the spot!"
###534 And Hong wrote, "I`m not surprised by this punishment, because it`s quite popular in
###537 my home country. This type of punishment does not cause any harm."
###541 Today`s before we go segment is a tale where cuisine meets convenience.
###547 This vending machine in a California mall seems a little fishy. It`s because it`s filled
###551 with caviar, fish eggs. Now you can snack while you shop in style. The prices run anywhere
###558 from 12 bucks to 500. Add it all up, and this machine`s filled with $50,000 in merchandise.
###566 Some critics say caviar doesn`t belong in the food court, but if shoppers are willing
###570 to pay, it seems like an eggselent idea. If you do have any official complaints, you could
###576 take it up with the sturgeon general. But you might have to vent for yourself because
###579 you could just be fighting an upstream battle.
###581 We just hope you won`t start a row, because that would be in bad taste. We hope you have
###585 a great rest of the day. CNN STUDENT NEWS. I`m Carl Azuz.
