1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:11,99
   PROFESSOR: ANY QUESTIONS ON COURSE
LOGISTICS THAT I CAN HELP WITH? YOU'VE SEEN


2
0:0:11,99 --> 0:0:17,5
THAT THE QUESTIONS ARE UP ON BSPACE. AND
THAT I WON'T PUT ANSWERS UP ANYTIME SOON.


3
0:0:17,5 --> 0:0:24,669
SO THE INTENTION IS THAT YOU WILL TRY THE
QUESTIONS AND TALK ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR


4
0:0:24,669 --> 0:0:32,93
COLLEAGUES AS A MEANS OF LEARNING ABOUT THEM.
ANY QUESTIONS ON COURSE LOGISTICS THAT I


5
0:0:32,93 --> 0:0:46,8
CAN HELP YOU WITH NOW? YES. STUDENT: DO
YOU KNOW HOW LONG THE MIDTERM IS? PROFESSOR:


6
0:0:46,8 --> 0:0:54,53
NO. THE MIDTERM IS 33 QUESTIONS. SHE ASKED
IF THAT'S HOW LONG THE MIDTERM IS. NO, THAT'S


7
0:0:54,53 --> 0:0:59,78
NOT MEANT TO REFLECT THE MIDTERM IN ANYWAY.
THIS IS THE DANGER OF GIVING YOU GUYS PRACTICE


8
0:0:59,78 --> 0:1:4,839
QUESTIONS. I DON'T THINK ALL THE INSTRUCTORS
WILL DO THAT BECAUSE STUDENTS TEND TO THINK


9
0:1:4,839 --> 0:1:9,689
THIS IS WHAT THE MIDTERM IS LIKE. CAN'T PROMISE
THAT. HAVEN'T WRITTEN THE MIDTERM YET. I DON'T


10
0:1:9,689 --> 0:1:14,649
KNOW WHAT THE MIDTERM IS GOING TO BE LIKE.
IT MIGHT BE A LOT HARDER. DON'T KNOW. BUT


11
0:1:14,649 --> 0:1:20,17
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU GUYS TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTION IS LIKE


12
0:1:20,17 --> 0:1:25,92
THAT I WRITE. I DIDN'T WRITE ALL THE ONES
I JUST GAVE YOU BUT I WROTE SOME OF THEM.


13
0:1:25,92 --> 0:1:31,609
AND THEY ARE MUCH LIKE THE TYPES THAT YOU
WILL ASK YOU. BUT THEY COULD BE HARDER ON


14
0:1:31,609 --> 0:1:38,889
THE TEXT. SO DON'T SLACK OFF, PLEASE. WHAT
ELSE? ANYTHING ELSE? OKAY. FEEL FREE TO


15
0:1:38,889 --> 0:1:46,179
E-MAIL ME IF ANYTHING COMES UP THAT YOU NEED
ANSWERS TO. WE ARE CONTINUING TODAY WITH


16
0:1:46,179 --> 0:1:59,429
ECOSYSTEM ECOLOGY. AND WE WILL FIRST


17
0:1:59,429 --> 0:2:6,649
COVER SOME GEOLOGY REALLY. AS A MEANS OF UNDERSTANDING
THE  PHYSICAL BASIS FOR OBSERVED PATTERNS


18
0:2:6,649 --> 0:2:17,689
ON A GLOBAL SCALE IN THE BIOTA IN BIOLOGICAL
COMMUNITIES AND ECOSYSTEMS. WE WILL REVIEW


19
0:2:17,689 --> 0:2:23,4
THE TERRESTRIAL BIOMES OF THE WORLD  VERY
BRIEFLY. YOUR BOOK COVERS IT WELL. IN THE


20
0:2:23,4 --> 0:2:32,37
CONTEXT OF GLOBAL PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE
PATTERNS, CLIMOGRAPHS, WE WILL LOOK AT AQUATIC


21
0:2:32,37 --> 0:2:41,95
BIOMES, FOCUSING ON THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE
OF LAKES AND OCEANS. AND CONSIDER NUTRIENT


22
0:2:41,95 --> 0:2:49,62
LIMITATION AND PRODUCTIVITY OF SUCH SYSTEMS.
AND THEN CONSIDER PRODUCTIVITY OF ECOSYSTEMS


23
0:2:49,62 --> 0:3:0,53
ON A GLOBAL SCALE COMPARING BIOMES TO ONE
ANOTHER. WE, I PUT SOMETHING IN HERE ON DIVERSITY


24
0:3:0,53 --> 0:3:9,219
GRADIENTS. AND THE CAUSES BEHIND HIGH TROPICAL
DIVERSITY. HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET TO SOMETHING


25
0:3:9,219 --> 0:3:13,64
I HAVEN'T PUT IN BEFORE AND I WANT TO GET
TO DURING THE LECTURE CYCLE. I PUT IT IN BUT


26
0:3:13,64 --> 0:3:18,95
I DIDN'T BULLET IT HERE. AND I'M NOT SURE
IF WE'LL GET TO HYDROLOGICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL


27
0:3:18,95 --> 0:3:24,18
CYCLES. IF WE DON'T I MAY JUST GIVE YOU
THE SLIDES AND ASK YOU TO REVIEW IT IN THE


28
0:3:24,18 --> 0:3:31,31
BOOK BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO MUCH
MORE DETAIL THAN THE BOOK ALREADY PROVIDES.


29
0:3:31,31 --> 0:3:37,299
ALL RIGHT. FOR SOME OF YOU THIS WILL BE REVIEW.
FOR OTHERS PERHAPS NOT. FOR EVERYONE THIS


30
0:3:37,299 --> 0:3:41,769
IS OF INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE. BECAUSE YOU'RE
EARTHLINGS AND YOU ARE SUBJECT TO THESE FORCES


31
0:3:41,769 --> 0:3:51,0
OF GLOBAL CLIMATE. AND MORE AND MORE PRESSING
ARE THESE FORCES WITH THE CHANGES THAT WE'RE


32
0:3:51,0 --> 0:3:57,659
SEEING IN RECENT DECADES, RECENT CENTURIES
AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES. THE FIRST


33
0:3:57,659 --> 0:4:3,819
THING TO CONSIDER AND I WON'T REVIEW MUCH
HERE IS THE FACT THAT THE EARTH AS A RESULT


34
0:4:3,819 --> 0:4:13,34
OF BEING SPHERICAL RECEIVES SOLAR ENERGY
WITH GREATER INTENSITY IN THE EQUATORIAL REGIONS


35
0:4:13,34 --> 0:4:19,269
AS A RESULT OF MORE DIRECT STRIKE OF PHOTONS
IN THOSE REGIONS. THE SUN'S RAYS STRIKE


36
0:4:19,269 --> 0:4:26,94
MORE OBLIQUELY TOWARD THE POLES AND THIS MEANS
  LESS SOLAR INPUT. THE EARTH IS ALSO


37
0:4:26,94 --> 0:4:37,11
TILTED ON ITS AXIS AND IT ORBITS THE SUN.
AS A RESULT WE HAVE OUR SEASONAL CYCLES.


38
0:4:37,11 --> 0:4:43,99
DETAILS OF THAT PHYSICAL PROCESS ISN'T OF
IMPORTANCE BUT YOU CAN READ ABOUT IT IN THE


39
0:4:43,99 --> 0:4:51,819
BOOK IF YOU WANT. IT'S NOT OF IMPORTANCE FOR
OUR PURPOSES. NOTE THAT BECAUSE OF THE INTENSITY


40
0:4:51,819 --> 0:5:4,22
OF SOLAR ENERGY AT THE EQUATOR, THAT WATER
EVAPORATES IN THIS AREA AND AS THE AIR IS


41
0:5:4,22 --> 0:5:11,84
HEATED IT RISES. UPON RISING THIS NOW MOIST
AIR RELEASES THAT MOISTURE, IT CONDENSES


42
0:5:11,84 --> 0:5:22,31
OUT IN RAINS AND GENERATES OF PHENOMENON OF
THE HOT WET TROPICAL REGIONS. AS THE AIR


43
0:5:22,31 --> 0:5:29,889
CONTINUES ITS ASCENT LOSING MOISTURE, IT
COOLS AND BECOME DENSER AND IT'S DRY AND IT


44
0:5:29,889 --> 0:5:37,69
DESCENDS. NOTE WHERE WE ARE ON THE EARTH.
SOME 23 DEGREES NORTH LATITUDE HERE. BUT


45
0:5:37,69 --> 0:5:44,919
THE SAME PHENOMENON IS HAPPENING IN THE
SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR. AND THIS DRY DESCENDING


46
0:5:44,919 --> 0:5:53,44
AIR ABSORBS MOISTURE, ACTUALLY PULLS MOISTURE
FROM THE LAND AND OUT OF THE AIR. AND AS


47
0:5:53,44 --> 0:5:58,47
A RESULT, THESE TEND TO BE VERY ARID REGIONS.
AND YOUR GREAT DESERTS OF THE WORLD ARE


48
0:5:58,47 --> 0:6:4,69
INDEED SITUATED AT THESE LATITUDES, NORTH
AND SOUTH. THE ATACAMA DESERT, ONE OF DRYEST


49
0:6:4,69 --> 0:6:18,9
PLACES ON THE EARTH. YOUR NORTH AMERICAN
GREAT SOUTHWESTERN DESERTS. THAT DRY AIR SOME


50
0:6:18,9 --> 0:6:28,27
OF IT WILL THEN TRAVEL NORTHWARD. IT'S WARM,
IT'S GOING TO RISE. IT'S PICKING UP MOISTURE.


51
0:6:28,27 --> 0:6:34,39
AND IT DROPS IT AGAIN IN THIS PART OF THE
WORLD. NOT AS MUCH AS IT'S DROPPED IN THE


52
0:6:34,39 --> 0:6:39,68
TROPICS BUT STILL A LOT. THIS GENERATES
OF PHENOMENON OF OUR TEMPERED RAIN FORESTS


53
0:6:39,68 --> 0:6:44,979
LIKE WE HAVE ON THE OLYMPIC PENINSULA SAY
IN THE WASHINGTON OR EVEN SOME AREAS OF CALIFORNIA


54
0:6:44,979 --> 0:6:50,5
WHERE YOU GET VERY BIG TREES AND VERY DENSE
FORESTS WITH LUSH VEGETATION GROWTH AS A RESULT


55
0:6:50,5 --> 0:6:56,759
OF THIS VERY PHENOMENON. SOMETHING SIMILAR
IS HAPPENING IN PATAGONIA IN SOUTHERN CHILE


56
0:6:56,759 --> 0:7:4,43
AND ARGENTINA WITH THESE TEMPERATE 
 RAINFORESTS AS OPPOSED TO TROPICAL RAINFORESTS.


57
0:7:4,43 --> 0:7:8,36
AND THEN FOLLOW YOU CAN FOLLOW IT FURTHER
THAT AIR, SOME OF THAT RISING AIR DESCENDS


58
0:7:8,36 --> 0:7:14,56
NOW DRIED DESCENDS OVER THE POLES, DRY AIR
ABSORBING EVEN MORE MOISTURE. AND THE POLES


59
0:7:14,56 --> 0:7:25,77
ARE QUITE DESICCATED AND COLD, OF COURSE.
SO WE CAN SEE FROM A SOLAR DRIVER AT THE


60
0:7:25,77 --> 0:7:30,979
EQUATOR HOW MUCH CAN BE EXPLAINED ABOUT
NOT ONLY GLOBAL AIR CIRCULATION PATTERNS AND


61
0:7:30,979 --> 0:7:40,319
PRECIPITATION BUT VEGETATION. ALSO VERY
COOL. THE DETAILS ARE NOT CRITICAL. I'LL


62
0:7:40,319 --> 0:7:46,879
JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW THINGS HERE THOUGH. THE
FACT THAT THE WARMING OF THE OCEAN SURFACES


63
0:7:46,879 --> 0:7:55,4
AT THE EQUATOR AS A RESULT OF INTENSE SOLAR
ENERGY PRODUCES A NORTH CIRCULATING CURRENT


64
0:7:55,4 --> 0:8:2,83
ON THE SURFACE WATERS, THE HOT AIR, THE
HOT WATER BEING AT THE SURFACE. IT COOLS AS


65
0:8:2,83 --> 0:8:12,3
IT TRENDS NORTH. AND THAT COOL DENSER WATER
DIVES DEEP, THIS IS THE GULF STREAM, DIVES


66
0:8:12,3 --> 0:8:21,479
DEEP AND CIRCULATES IN DEEP CHANNELS ALL
AROUND THE WORLD. AND THIS DEEP WATER MAY


67
0:8:21,479 --> 0:8:28,659
REMAIN IN THESE CURRENTS FOR AS LONG AS
A THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE BEFORE IT MAKES


68
0:8:28,659 --> 0:8:38,44
ITS WAY BACK TO THE SURFACE IN THE WARMER
WATER CONDITIONS. THESE, THIS INTERACTION


69
0:8:38,44 --> 0:8:49,85
BETWEEN WARM AND COLD CURRENTS IN THIS AREA
PRODUCES A LOT OF FOG. AND SOMETHING RELATED


70
0:8:49,85 --> 0:8:59,86
IS HAPPENING IN OUR AREA WITH THE FOG THAT
WE SEE HERE. THIS IS IN OUR AREA RELATED


71
0:8:59,86 --> 0:9:4,61
PRIMARILY TO THE TEMPERATURE DEFERENTIAL BETWEEN
OUR OLD CURRENTS, THEY'RE SHOWN AS GETTING


72
0:9:4,61 --> 0:9:10,4
WARMER, BUT THEY'RE STILL VERY COLD CURRENTS
THAT WE EXPERIENCE OFF OUR COAST. AND THE


73
0:9:10,4 --> 0:9:17,51
INTERACTION OF THOSE COLD CURRENT WITH WARM
AIR MASSES IS IN PART RESPONSIBLE FOR THE


74
0:9:17,51 --> 0:9:27,35
GENERATION OF FOG OVER OUR WATERS, OFF-SHORE
HERE.  NOW WITH THE GENERATION OF THIS


75
0:9:27,35 --> 0:9:34,45
FOG, OVER THE OCEANS HERE, SOME OF IT'S
PULLED ONTO LANDS. SOME OF ITS PUSHED ONTO


76
0:9:34,45 --> 0:9:41,64
LAND BY WINDS BEHIND IT, BUT SOME OF IT IS
PULLED ONTO LANDS AS A RESULT MUCH ACTION


77
0:9:41,64 --> 0:9:48,17
OF WARM AIR OVER THE LAND RISING, THINK
OF HOW HOT IT GETS IN THE INTERIOR OF CALIFORNIA


78
0:9:48,17 --> 0:9:54,42
OR IN THE HILLS OR JUST OVER THE HILLS HERE
IN SUMMERTIME. THIS WARM AIR IS RISING.


79
0:9:54,42 --> 0:10:1,97
AND THE COOL AIR FROM THE OCEANS IS BEING
DRAWN IN TO REPLACE THAT WARM RISING AIR.


80
0:10:1,97 --> 0:10:8,88
AND THERE'S OFTEN FOG IN THE SUMMERTIME
IN THAT AIR BEING PULLED ONTO LAND. SOMETIMES


81
0:10:8,88 --> 0:10:17,3
WORKS IN CYCLES WHERE THAT AIR CONDITIONING
FOG COOLS THE AIR OVER THE LAND AND INTERRUPTS


82
0:10:17,3 --> 0:10:22,49
THIS KIND OF CYCLE. SO HIGHLIGHTING THAT IN
RELATION TO THE FOG HERE. BUT THIS HAS A MODERATING


83
0:10:22,49 --> 0:10:29,82
EFFECT ON CLIMATE IN COASTAL AREAS IN GENERAL
BECAUSE THE WARM LAND AIR IS GOING TO BE


84
0:10:29,82 --> 0:10:36,86
REPLACED BY COOL MARINE AIR. AND THAT'S WHAT
MAKES THE COASTS MORE MODERATE IN THEIR


85
0:10:36,86 --> 0:10:42,61
CLIMATES THAN AREAS INLAND. AND SOMETHING
SIMILAR IS HAPPENING OVER THE OCEANS THEMSELVES.


86
0:10:42,61 --> 0:10:54,1
WHERE THE WARM AIR FROM THE LAND IS WARMING
UP THE COOL OCEANIC AIR. BUT LET'S LOOK


87
0:10:54,1 --> 0:11:0,0
AT THIS FOG PHENOMENON BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF
THE REALLY INTERESTING CHARACTERISTICS OF


88
0:11:0,0 --> 0:11:6,139
OUR POSITION RIGHT HERE ON EARTH. AND IT
HAS A GREAT EFFECT ON LOCAL ECOSYSTEMS AS


89
0:11:6,139 --> 0:11:12,269
EVIDENCED BY RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN THIS
DEPARTMENT. IN RELATION TO THE VEGETATION


90
0:11:12,269 --> 0:11:19,209
AND IN RELATION TO REDWOOD COMMUNITIES. LOOK
AT THE LEVELS OF FOG ACROSS THE YEAR. IT'S


91
0:11:19,209 --> 0:11:23,29
REALLY FOGGY IN THE SUMMER, RIGHT? THAT'S
WHAT SAN FRANCISCO IS SO DARN COLD IN THE


92
0:11:23,29 --> 0:11:27,639
SUMMER. BECAUSE OF THIS FOG. WE'VE HAD A
VERY FOGGY SUMMER, AT LEAST  THE EARLY


93
0:11:27,639 --> 0:11:34,51
PART OF THIS SUMMER AND NOT MUCH SUNSHINE.
WHEN THESE FOG LEVELS ARE SO HIGH, LOOK


94
0:11:34,51 --> 0:11:44,66
AT THE RAIN FALL. RAINFALL IS AT THE LOWEST
POINT AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT THE FOG PEAKS.


95
0:11:44,66 --> 0:11:53,399
THINK OF THIS IN TERMS OF THE PLANTS AND
ORGANISMS NEED FOR WATER. HOW DO WE POSSIBLY


96
0:11:53,399 --> 0:12:1,86
GET SUCH MASSIVE FORESTS GROWING IN THIS AREA
WHEN RAINFALL IS SO LOW DURING THE HOTTEST


97
0:12:1,86 --> 0:12:12,43
TIMES OF THE YEAR? AS YOU MIGHT SUSPECT
IT'S RELATED TO THIS FOG. SOME OF THE RESEARCH


98
0:12:12,43 --> 0:12:17,98
ON THIS IS JUST FABULOUS. DONE BY VARIOUS
TEAMS OF RESEARCHERS INCLUDING THE DAWSON


99
0:12:17,98 --> 0:12:24,639
LAB, TODD DAWSON'S HERE. THESE ARE, THESE,
THE STUDY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU IS A STUDY


100
0:12:24,639 --> 0:12:38,29
IN ECOPHYSIOLOGY. AND THE DATA THAT THEY
RELY ON FOR UNTANGLING THIS PHENOMENON IS


101
0:12:38,29 --> 0:12:46,74
THE SCIENCE OF BIOGEOCHEMISTRY INDUSTRY.
I HOPE YOU'LL INVESTIGATE IT FURTHER. I'LL


102
0:12:46,74 --> 0:12:55,3
TALK MORE ABOUT BIOGEOCHEMISTRY NEXT WEEK.
HERE'S, SHOWING THE FOG OFF-SHORE. I MEAN


103
0:12:55,3 --> 0:13:3,36
BURR. I HEARD ONE SAY IT'S LIKE A COZY BLANKET.
IF YOU THINK OF IT THAT WAY IT'S A LITTLE


104
0:13:3,36 --> 0:13:4,26
MORE ACCEPTABLE.


105
0:13:4,26 --> 0:13:13,1
IT CAN REALLY MAKE THINGS FRIGID THROUGHOUT
MUCH OF THE SUMMER. YOU DON'T NEED TO UNDERSTAND


106
0:13:13,1 --> 0:13:21,89
ISOTOPE CHEMISTRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS
STUDY IN BIOGEOCHEMISTRY. JUST SKIP BACK TO


107
0:13:21,89 --> 0:13:21,709
THAT REAL QUICK.


108
0:13:21,709 --> 0:13:32,1
LOOK AT THAT WORD. BIO, LIGHT. RIGHT? GEO,
EARTH. CHEMISTRY, CHEMISTRY. SO BIOGEOCHEMISTRY


109
0:13:32,1 --> 0:13:41,48
IS THE STUDY OF THIS KIND OF INTERACTIVE SYSTEM.
IT'S THE USE OF CHEMISTRY TO STUDY THE INTERACTION


110
0:13:41,48 --> 0:13:51,66
BETWEEN LIFE AND EARTH. IT'S CHEMISTRY TO
STUDY LIVING ECOSYSTEMS. ECOPHYSIOLOGY,


111
0:13:51,66 --> 0:13:59,5
PHYSIOLOGY RELATED TO THE ECOLOGY OF INDIVIDUAL
ORGANISMS IN THE CONTEXT OF LOCAL ECOSYSTEMS.


112
0:13:59,5 --> 0:14:5,16
THESE ARE GREAT INTEGRATIVE FIELDS. AND
NO SURPRISE THAT THERE ARE THOSE IN THIS


113
0:14:5,16 --> 0:14:12,67
DEPARTMENT IN INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY WHO ARE
SUPERB IN THIS WORK. AS I SAID,  YOU


114
0:14:12,67 --> 0:14:19,759
DON'T NEED TO UNDERSTAND ISOTOPES IN A CHEMICAL
SENSE TO UNDERSTAND THE WORD. JUST TO SAY


115
0:14:19,759 --> 0:14:26,88
THAT ATOMIC ELEMENTS EXIST IN DIFFERENT
ISOTOPIC FORMS AS A RESULT OF DIFFERENCES


116
0:14:26,88 --> 0:14:38,73
NEUTRONS IN THEIR NUCLEUS. SO ISOTOPE RATIO
IS THE RATIO OF A HEAVY ISOTOPE TO A LIGHT


117
0:14:38,73 --> 0:14:45,82
ISOTOPE, IN THIS CASE HEAVY HYDROGEN TO
LIGHT HYDROGEN, DEUTERIUM TO HYDROGEN. BUT


118
0:14:45,82 --> 0:14:57,779
JUST RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A QUANTIFICATION
OF ATOMIC NUCLEI IN RELATION TO THE WATER


119
0:14:57,779 --> 0:15:8,43
IN FOG AND THE WATER IN RAINFALL. SO RAIN
WATER HERE AND FOG WATER HERE QUANTIFIED BY


120
0:15:8,43 --> 0:15:16,459
THEIR HYDROGEN ISOTOPE RATIO. FOG WATER
IS VERY HEAVY IN HYDROGEN ISOTOPES. IT HAS


121
0:15:16,459 --> 0:15:21,699
A LOT OF THE HEAVY ISOTOPE DEUTERIUM IN IT.
MUCH DIFFERENT FROM RAINFALL. NO OVERLAP.


122
0:15:21,699 --> 0:15:29,399
THEY'RE COMPLETELY DISTINCT. WHEN YOU LOOK
AT VARIOUS PLANTS THAT GROW IN THE RAINFOREST


123
0:15:29,399 --> 0:15:34,199
COMMUNITY INCLUDING, I'M SORRY, IN THE REDWOOD
COMMUNITY, INCLUDING REDWOODS THEMSELVES,


124
0:15:34,199 --> 0:15:47,74
SEQUOIA SEMPERVIRENS, YOU SEE THAT THE WATER
INSIDE THESE PLANTS IS OF AN ISOTOPIC RATIO


125
0:15:47,74 --> 0:15:57,62
BETWEEN THE FOG AND THE RAINFALL. AND THAT
IT CYCLES IN RELATION TO BOTH OVER THE COURSE


126
0:15:57,62 --> 0:16:5,1
OF EACH YEAR. THESE BEING THE 12 MONTHS
IN THREE DIFFERENT YEARS. YOU CAN DO THE


127
0:16:5,1 --> 0:16:12,8
MATH AND THE DETERMINE THAT ALMOST A THIRD
OF THE WATER USED BY THE PLANTS IN THESE


128
0:16:12,8 --> 0:16:19,62
SYSTEMS IS COMING FROM FOG ITSELF. IT'S, THE
PLANTS, THE LEAVES ARE NOT DRINKING THE FOG


129
0:16:19,62 --> 0:16:25,19
BUT THE FOG IS COLLECTING ON THE PLANTS
AND DRIPPING IN THE SOILS AND BEING CONSUMED


130
0:16:25,19 --> 0:16:33,93
BY THE PLANTS. AND THAT'S FANTASTIC, THAT'S
REALLY COOL. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN GET SUCH


131
0:16:33,93 --> 0:16:40,149
MAGNIFICENT FORESTS OF SUCH COMPLEXITY PROBABLY
IN THESE REGIONS AS A RESULT OF FOG INPUT


132
0:16:40,149 --> 0:16:46,279
DURING THE DRYEST AND HOTTEST TIMES OF THE
YEAR. THUS, AND YOU MIGHT ALSO  THINK


133
0:16:46,279 --> 0:16:53,56
ABOUT WHAT CHANGES IN FOG LEVELS, WHAT KIND
OF IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES


134
0:16:53,56 --> 0:17:0,63
IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.
FOG IS ONE PHENOMENON THAT'S LIKELY TO CHANGE


135
0:17:0,63 --> 0:17:11,56
QUITE A LOT. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF THIS
PHENOMENON OF AIR, WHEN ASCENDING AGAINST


136
0:17:11,56 --> 0:17:20,89
A LAND MASS DROPS ITS MOISTURE DURING THE
ASCENT, SUCH THAT WHEN IT FINDS THE LEEWARD


137
0:17:20,89 --> 0:17:28,2
SIDE OF MOUNTAIN, IT'S LOST ALL ITS MOISTURE
AND HAS NOTHING TO RAIN OUT. SO ON THE LEEWARD


138
0:17:28,2 --> 0:17:35,3
SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN YOU OFTEN GET AREAS OF
GREAT ARIDITY. THINK OF NEVADA OR THE MOHAVE


139
0:17:35,3 --> 0:17:40,86
DESERT IN THE SOUTH AS A RESULT OF RAIN
SHADOW CREATED IN THE SIERRA NEVADA, THE GREAT


140
0:17:40,86 --> 0:17:50,8
BASIN. THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE MOHAVE DESERT
WHICH MANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY BEEN TO. SOME


141
0:17:50,8 --> 0:18:1,81
OF YOUR GREAT CLOUD FORESTS AND ALPINE WET
FORESTS MAY OCCUR IN THESE CONDITIONS.


142
0:18:1,81 --> 0:18:8,79
SO THAT'S SOME OF THE GLOBAL BACKGROUND TO
THE DISTRIBUTION OF VEGETATION ON A VERY


143
0:18:8,79 --> 0:18:18,32
BROAD BRUSHSTROKE. BUT IT'S HELPFUL. THIS
IS A SCIENCE OF MACROCLIMATE AND MACROSCALE


144
0:18:18,32 --> 0:18:27,68
COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. A BIOME IS A COMMUNITY
AT A VERY LARGE-SCALE. IT'S A COMMUNITY,


145
0:18:27,68 --> 0:18:34,29
IT'S ACTUALLY MANY COMMUNITIES THAT SHARE
CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS SUCH THAT THEY ARE


146
0:18:34,29 --> 0:18:43,69
DISTINGUISHABLE FROM COLLECTIONS OF COMMUNITIES
IN NEIGHBORING AREAS. AND THESE ARE BIOMES.


147
0:18:43,69 --> 0:18:51,23
THEY'RE DISTINCT IN TERMS OF THE ORGANISMS
THAT LIVE THERE, IN TERMS OF THE CLIMATES


148
0:18:51,23 --> 0:18:55,34
THAT THEY'RE EXPOSED TO AND PARTLY DRIVEN
BY THOSE CLIMATES. THEY'RE DISTINCT IN MANY


149
0:18:55,34 --> 0:19:3,18
WAYS. YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR MACROSCOPE AND
STUDY THESE THINGS. SOME OF THE  ECOLOGISTS


150
0:19:3,18 --> 0:19:8,42
SPEAK OF LEAVING THE MICROSCOPE IN THE LAB
AND TAKING OUT THE MACROSCOPE AND GOING


151
0:19:8,42 --> 0:19:17,72
OUT TO THE FILED AND SEEING WHOLE SYSTEMS
THROUGH THAT. IT'S A METAPHOR OBVIOUSLY.


152
0:19:17,72 --> 0:19:22,94
HOW DO YOU DISTINGUISH THESE BIOMES? YOU CAN
DO IT YOURSELF BASED ON WHAT YOU ALREADY


153
0:19:22,94 --> 0:19:34,26
KNOW AS A RESULT OF WHAT IS, PHYSIOGNOMY
OF THESE SYSTEMS. IT'S REALLY JUST THEIR GESTALT


154
0:19:34,26 --> 0:19:40,19
APPEARANCE, HOW THEY LOOK TO YOU. THIS ONE
HAS A BUNCH OF WAVING GRASSES, SOME TREES


155
0:19:40,19 --> 0:19:47,51
ON THE EDGES. THAT'S A PRETTY HEAVY FOREST.
AND A GRASSY PATCH IN THE MIDDLE. YOU MIGHT


156
0:19:47,51 --> 0:19:53,7
NOT KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHAT KIND OF ECOSYSTEM
IT IS BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A DRY FOREST. IT


157
0:19:53,7 --> 0:19:58,51
LOOKS LIKE A SEASONAL DRY FOREST OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT. SEASONAL DRY FOREST. THAT MIGHT


158
0:19:58,51 --> 0:20:3,67
LOOK LIKE NEAR SOME NATURAL AREA WHERE YOU
GREW UP. MANY OF YOU ARE FROM CALIFORNIA.


159
0:20:3,67 --> 0:20:13,87
THAT'S A CHAPARRAL, THIS NEAR AREA WITH THESE,
THE TREES ARE JUST SMALLER. THEY'RE SMALLER


160
0:20:13,87 --> 0:20:20,4
IN HERE. MOSTLY SHRUBBY LOW-LYING GROWTH
THAT WE CALL CHAPARRAL. IN THE DISTANCE YOU


161
0:20:20,4 --> 0:20:26,6
SEE MORE CONIFER FOREST. IT'S JUST HOW IT
LOOKS. THESE ARE BIG TREES. THESE ARE SMALL


162
0:20:26,6 --> 0:20:32,1
SPINDLY TREES AND THESE ARE YOUR SHRUBBY LOWER
LYING BITS OF VEGETATION. THIS IS THE PHYSIOGNOMY


163
0:20:32,1 --> 0:20:37,79
OF THIS SYSTEM. THAT'S A VERY LUSH SYSTEM
WITH LOTS OF EPITHETIC GROWTH, PLANTS GROWING


164
0:20:37,79 --> 0:20:48,91
ON OTHER PLANTS. THESE TRUNKS ARE CAKED WITH
GREEN LEAVES. YOU HAVE VINES HANGING DOWN


165
0:20:48,91 --> 0:20:53,67
FROM THE CANOPY. YOU HAVE MOSSES GROWING
ON THE ROCK. WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM DO YOU THINK


166
0:20:53,67 --> 0:20:58,63
THIS IS? SOMEONE SAID A CLOUD FOREST. YEAH,
IT COULD VERY


167
0:20:58,63 --> 0:21:6,27
WELL BE A CLOUD FOREST OR A RAINFOREST. A
TROPICAL FOREST ENVIRONMENT PROBABLY. SOME


168
0:21:6,27 --> 0:21:10,68
LUSH FOREST. THIS ONE LOOKS MORE TO ME VERY
LUSH ALSO, LOOKS MORE TO ME LIKE A TEMPERATE


169
0:21:10,68 --> 0:21:22,13
RAINFOREST. THE FERNS AND I DON'T KNOW MAYBE
SORO [SP?] YOU'LL KNOW BETTER AFTER THE BOTANY


170
0:21:22,13 --> 0:21:32,35
MODULE WHAT THESE THINGS ARE. OR THIS, VERY
CHARACTERISTIC, OPEN GRASSLAND, TENDS TO BE


171
0:21:32,35 --> 0:21:38,75
DRY. OCCASIONAL SPOTTY TREES. IT'S A SAVANNA.
RIGHT.  IT'S A GREAT SAVANNA. YOU CAN


172
0:21:38,75 --> 0:21:56,6
TELL BY THE STRIPPY HORSES HERE YOU'RE IN
AFRICA.
THAT COULD BE VERY NEARBY HERE. THESE LOW,


173
0:21:56,6 --> 0:22:4,54
GRADUALLY SLOPING HILLS. ERODED, THESE ERODED
HILLTOPS, GRASSLANDS MODIFIED THROUGH AGRICULTURE


174
0:22:4,54 --> 0:22:10,63
OR GRAZING PROBABLY. SCATTERED TREES, OAKS.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, COULD BE A PARK IN THE


175
0:22:10,63 --> 0:22:16,42
EAST BAY. SO I'M JUST GIVING YOU A HINT
OF HOW YOU CAN LOOK AT THESE SYSTEMS. AND


176
0:22:16,42 --> 0:22:21,8
YOU RECOGNIZE THESE DIFFERENCES, YOU ALREADY
DO. IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE THESE SENSORY


177
0:22:21,8 --> 0:22:27,14
SYSTEMS YOU USE TO DISTINGUISH AMONG THEM.
IT'S JUST A NATURAL THING TO DO. SO NOW


178
0:22:27,14 --> 0:22:32,71
LET'S PUT SOME TECHNICAL NAMES ON THEM SO
YOU KNOW WHAT TO CALL THEM IN THE SCIENTIFIC


179
0:22:32,71 --> 0:22:42,17
SENSE AND THAT WOULD BE THE PROCESS OF NAMING
OUR TERRESTRIAL BIOMES. THIS IS A CLIMOGRAPH


180
0:22:42,17 --> 0:22:53,34
WHERE ON YOUR AXES OF PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE,
YOU CAN ANALYZE THE DISTRIBUTION OF TERRESTRIAL


181
0:22:53,34 --> 0:22:59,52
VEGETATION MORE OR LESS ACCURATELY. THIS
IS A, THIS IS SOMETHING OF A CARTOON, BUT


182
0:22:59,52 --> 0:23:12,5
IT'S BASED ON REAL DATA. YOU CAN SEE HOW
NICELY THESE BIOTYPES, THESE VEGETATION TYPES


183
0:23:12,5 --> 0:23:19,3
CAN BE MODELED ON JUST THOSE TWO AXES OF
TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION. SO IF IT'S


184
0:23:19,3 --> 0:23:31,81
REAL HOT, BUT REALLY DRY, YOU GET A DESERT.
SUBTROPICAL DESERT. A BIT MORE WATER, YOU


185
0:23:31,81 --> 0:23:39,32
MIGHT HAVE A TROPICAL DRY FOREST LIKE YOU
SAW IN THAT ONE OR A SAVANNA. AND IF IT'S


186
0:23:39,32 --> 0:23:48,93
REALLY HOT BUT REALLY WET, TALKING ABOUT A
RAINFOREST. DOES ANYONE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT


187
0:23:48,93 --> 0:23:55,62
SAVANNAS? WHAT ELSE HELPS TO DRIVE AND STRUCTURE
THEM? WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE.


188
0:23:55,62 --> 0:24:4,46
I JUST LIKE SAVANNAS. OR IF IT'S REALLY
COLD AND REALLY DRY, THE TUNDRA. SOMEWHAT


189
0:24:4,46 --> 0:24:10,12
MORE MOISTURE. THE HIGH LATITUDE FORESTS,
BOREAL FORESTS. I'LL SHOW YOU PICTURES OF


190
0:24:10,12 --> 0:24:15,39
ALL OF THESE. OKAY. YOU GOT THE IDEA. AND
THEN OUR TEMPERATE RAINFORESTS WHERE 


191
0:24:15,39 --> 0:24:20,67
 STILL THERE'S A LOT OF MOISTURE. NOT AS MUCH
AS IN A TROPICAL RAINFOREST PROBABLY AND


192
0:24:20,67 --> 0:24:25,86
NOT AS HOT. BUT THAT'S OUR TEMPERATE RAINFOREST
THAT YOU WOULD GET NORTH OF HERE IF YOU


193
0:24:25,86 --> 0:24:35,21
DROVE UP THE COAST. COOL. AND JUST ANOTHER
VIEW FOCUSED MORE ON NORTH AMERICA, AXES SWITCHED


194
0:24:35,21 --> 0:24:43,14
JUST FOR YOU TO LOOK AT ON YOUR OWN TIME.
SO THESE ARE THE BIOME TYPES THAT YOUR BOOK


195
0:24:43,14 --> 0:24:49,4
PROVIDES. AND WE'LL JUST STICK WITH THOSE.
AND PLEASE LOOK AT THE BOOK FOR SOME OF THE


196
0:24:49,4 --> 0:24:53,95
DETAILS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THESE SYSTEMS,
WHAT DISTINGUISHES THEM. I WON'T SPEND TOO


197
0:24:53,95 --> 0:25:5,3
MUCH TIME ON THAT. I ALREADY MENTIONED MOST
OF THESE. YOUR TROPICAL FORESTS, DISTRIBUTED


198
0:25:5,3 --> 0:25:12,81
AROUND THE WORLD, THIS ONE FROM BORNEO.
BUT CENTRAL AFRICA. THE AMAZON FOREST, OF


199
0:25:12,81 --> 0:25:20,14
COURSE. SOME FABULOUS ONES IN CENTRAL AMERICA.
SOUTHEAST ASIA. THESE ARE THE TROPICAL RAINFORESTS.


200
0:25:20,14 --> 0:25:31,16
THESE ARE INTENSELY MODIFIED ECOSYSTEMS
FOR LIVING SPACE AND FOR AGRICULTURE, FOR


201
0:25:31,16 --> 0:25:36,97
HARVESTING OF TIMBER, AND THESE ARE THE SO-CALLED
LUNGS OF THE EARTH BECAUSE OF JUST HOW MUCH


202
0:25:36,97 --> 0:25:47,2
THEY'RE MAJOR IMPORTANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS
IN PROCESSING CARBON DIOXIDE, FOR EXAMPLE.


203
0:25:47,2 --> 0:25:55,76
SO THE LOSS OF THESE SYSTEMS IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE
TO ALL OF US AS A RESULT OF ITS INFLUENCE


204
0:25:55,76 --> 0:26:5,29
ON THE GLOBAL ATMOSPHERE. AND MUCH IS BEING
DONE TO TRY TO CURTAIL THE DESTRUCTION OF


205
0:26:5,29 --> 0:26:14,17
THESE SYSTEMS. CONTRAST THAT WITH THE DESERT
WITH YOUR PLANTS HEAVILY MODIFIED FOR RETAINING


206
0:26:14,17 --> 0:26:20,65
MOISTURE. SOMETIMES THE LEAVES ARE JUST
REDUCED TO SPINES THAT SERVE A PROTECTIVE


207
0:26:20,65 --> 0:26:32,7
FUNCTION BUT ALSO HELP TO AVOID WATER LOSS.
SPACING IN BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL PLANTS.


208
0:26:32,7 --> 0:26:37,96
YOU WOULDN'T SEE THIS KIND OF THING IN A RAINFOREST
WHERE THE CANOPY, THE CANOPY JUST BEING


209
0:26:37,96 --> 0:26:43,6
THE LAYER OF LEAFY GROWTH OF  PHOTOSYNTHETIC
CAPTURE WOULD BE CLOSED. YOU WOULD SPEAK OF


210
0:26:43,6 --> 0:26:44,43
A CLOSED CANOPY.


211
0:26:44,43 --> 0:26:55,32
THIS IS A VERY OPEN CANOPY, THERE'S A LOT
OF GAPS IN THE CANOPY HERE. AND SAVANNAS,


212
0:26:55,32 --> 0:27:1,39
SO WHAT IS IT ABOUT  SAVANNAS, WHY I DON'T
REALLY APPRECIATE PUTTING TJE, JUST UNDER


213
0:27:1,39 --> 0:27:6,7
A CLIMOGRAPH SO SIMPLY. WHAT'S ONE FACTOR
IN SAVANNAS THAT'S SO IMPORTANT TO THEIR


214
0:27:6,7 --> 0:27:9,64
MAINTENANCE? SOMEBODY MUST HAVE AN IDEA.


215
0:27:9,64 --> 0:27:12,3
STUDENT: HERDS OF ANIMALS.


216
0:27:12,3 --> 0:27:21,93
PROFESSOR: HERDS OF ANIMALS, YEAH. GRAZING
IS OF BIG IMPORTANCE IN A SAVANNA. AND VERY


217
0:27:21,93 --> 0:27:27,78
GREAT IMPORTANCE. SO YEAH, THAT'S ONE FACTOR.
YES. STUDENT: THEY HAVE VERY DRASTIC WET


218
0:27:27,78 --> 0:27:31,33
AND DRY SEASONS. PROFESSOR: THEY OFTEN DO
HAVE VERY DRASTIC WET AND DRY SEASONS. SO


219
0:27:31,33 --> 0:27:39,35
DOES A DRY SEASONAL FOREST. SO WHY A DRY SEASONAL
FOREST WITH THICK FOREST PATCHES THAT COULD


220
0:27:39,35 --> 0:27:45,36
STILL SURVIVE AN INTENSATIVE DRY SEASON
BUT IN THE SAVANNA JUST THESE SCATTERED TREES?


221
0:27:45,36 --> 0:27:49,9
STUDENT: FIRES.


222
0:27:49,9 --> 0:27:54,17
PROFESSOR: FIRES PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN THESE
SYSTEMS. AND HELP TO STRUCTURE WHAT YOU


223
0:27:54,17 --> 0:27:56,25
SEE OF ITS PHYSIOGNOMY HERE.


224
0:27:56,25 --> 0:27:59,99
JUST INDIVIDUAL TREES OFTEN GROWING NEAR BEAUTIFUL
SPREADING ACACIA


225
0:27:59,99 --> 0:28:6,47
THAT THE GIRAFFE MIGHT BE NIBBLING ON AS OPPOSED
TO MORE EXTENSIVE PATCHES OF FOREST THAT


226
0:28:6,47 --> 0:28:13,2
MAY NOT SURVIVE REGULAR BURNS OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT. SO SAVANNAS ARE, AT LEAST THE


227
0:28:13,2 --> 0:28:22,46
AFRICAN SAVANNAS, ARE PROBABLY IN MANY WAYS
EVOLVED TO DEAL WITH REGULAR FIRE INPUT.


228
0:28:22,46 --> 0:28:25,64
AND IT'S CERTAINLY INTERESTING TO THINK
ABOUT THAT IN RELATION TO HUMAN EVOLUTION


229
0:28:25,64 --> 0:28:29,0
THAT'S BEEN OCCURRING THERE FOR MILLION
OF YEARS AND THE DOMESTICATION


230
0:28:29,0 --> 0:28:37,47
AND USE OF FIRE HUMANS OR HUMAN ANCESTORS.
CALIFORNIA CHAPARRAL. NOTE THAT WHAT WE


231
0:28:37,47 --> 0:28:46,27
CALL CHAPARRAL OCCURS HERE IN THIS MEDITERRANEAN
CLIMATE WHERE WE HAVE THE HOT DRY SUMMER AND


232
0:28:46,27 --> 0:28:52,35
A COOL MOIST WINTER. FORGET FOG IN THE EQUATION
FOR THE MOMENT BECAUSE YOU GET THE CHAPARRAL


233
0:28:52,35 --> 0:28:58,84
OCCURRING WITHOUT MAJOR FOG INPUT IN, FOR
EXAMPLE, IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO HOT DRY


234
0:28:58,84 --> 0:29:6,26
SUMMER AND A COOL FAIRLY WET WINTER, THAT
OCCURS NOT ONLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT


235
0:29:6,26 --> 0:29:10,91
  AROUND THE MEDITERRANEAN. YOU SOMETIMES
HEAR OF THIS AS A MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE,


236
0:29:10,91 --> 0:29:15,57
OUR CLIMATE AS A MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE. AND
THIS TYPE OF VEGETATION AS A MEDITERRANEAN


237
0:29:15,57 --> 0:29:17,84
VEGETATION. IT'S NICE. IT THINK YOUR BOOK


238
0:29:17,84 --> 0:29:21,59
IS THE ONE THAT USES CHAPARRAL. THAT'S GREAT
BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY A TERM FROM CALIFORNIA.


239
0:29:21,59 --> 0:29:27,54
LET'S EXPORT  THAT TO EUROPE. YOU ALSO HAVE
SOMETHING SIMILAR GOING ON AT THE TIP OF


240
0:29:27,54 --> 0:29:39,45
AFRICA. MAYBE A BIT IN AUSTRALIA, CERTAINLY
A BIT IN CHILE. BUT ONLY IN THOSE SPOTS.


241
0:29:39,45 --> 0:29:44,15
YOU GET THIS KIND OF STRUCTURED VEGETATION
AS A RESULT OF THIS UNIQUE COMBINATION OF


242
0:29:44,15 --> 0:29:49,22
CLIMATIC FACTORS. IT'S REALLY PRETTY COOL.
THESE ARE ALSO FIRE PRONE SYSTEMS TOO AS


243
0:29:49,22 --> 0:30:1,38
WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL HERE. TEMPERATE GRASSLANDS.
SOME OF YOUR GREAT AGRICULTURAL GROWING REGIONS.


244
0:30:1,38 --> 0:30:10,94
FROM THESE WHAT ONCE WERE VAST TEMPERATE GRASSLANDS.
THE NORTHERN CONIFEROUS FORESTS OR BOREAL


245
0:30:10,94 --> 0:30:16,69
FORESTS MARKED PRIMARILY BY THE CONIFER
TREES, SOFT WOOD TREES, THE PINES AND SPRUCES


246
0:30:16,69 --> 0:30:17,63
AND HEMLOCKS AND THINGS


247
0:30:17,63 --> 0:30:26,26
LIKE THAT. AND THE BOREAL FOREST ZONE. IT'S
A HUGE REGION. SO IF ONLY FOR THAT REASON,


248
0:30:26,26 --> 0:30:32,62
IT'S OF GREAT GREAT IMPORTANCE. ALSO INTENSELY
HARVESTED FOR TIMBER AND THINGS BUT WE SPEAK


249
0:30:32,62 --> 0:30:38,34
OF THE LUNGS OF THE EARTH DOWN HERE, THIS
REGION IS ALSO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR


250
0:30:38,34 --> 0:30:46,14
GAS CAPTURE ON A GLOBAL SCALE. TEMPERATE
BROADLEAF FORESTS. THESE ARE THE TYPES OF


251
0:30:46,14 --> 0:30:54,21
SYSTEMS I GREW UP IN AND I JUST LOVE THEM.
YOU GET YOUR FALL FOLIAGE COLORS AS A RESULT


252
0:30:54,21 --> 0:31:1,91
OF DROPPING THE LEAVES OFF THE TREES IN THE
FALL AND WINTER. IT SNOWS A LOT IN SOME


253
0:31:1,91 --> 0:31:9,58
OF THESE AREAS BUT IT'S REALLY DRY BECAUSE
SNOW IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR UPTAKE BY PLANTS.


254
0:31:9,58 --> 0:31:15,87
SO THAT'S A TIME OF ARIDITY FOR MANY PLANTS
IS A PERIOD OF WINTER WHEN IT'S MAYBE A


255
0:31:15,87 --> 0:31:19,65
LOT OF PRECIPITATION BUT IT'S NOT AVAILABLE
FOR USE. AND IT'S ALSO JUST COLD AND MANY


256
0:31:19,65 --> 0:31:24,73
PLANTS CAN'T FUNCTION IN LOW TEMPERATURES.
SO ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS PLANTS USE IS TO


257
0:31:24,73 --> 0:31:33,95
DROP THEIR LEAVES. THEY'RE DECIDUOUS. THEY
DROP THE LEAVES DURING THAT SEASON. THE TUNDRA,


258
0:31:33,95 --> 0:31:40,0
TREELESS.  THIS IS LATITUDINALLY ABOVE
TREE LINE. YOU CAN GET SOMETHING SIMILAR


259
0:31:40,0 --> 0:31:42,3
IF YOU ASCEND A MOUNTAIN. YOU CAN ASCEND A
MOUNTAIN


260
0:31:42,3 --> 0:31:47,33
THROUGH THE FORESTS AND GET ABOVE TREE LINE
AND GET A TYPE OF ALPINE TUNDRA. YOU CAN


261
0:31:47,33 --> 0:31:50,29
DO THAT IN THE SIERRAS OR IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS


262
0:31:50,29 --> 0:31:55,86
AND THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT MOUNTAINS,
AS YOU MOVE UP A MOUNTAIN, IT'S ANALOGOUS


263
0:31:55,86 --> 0:32:2,28
TO MOVING UP IN LATITUDE. SO YOU CAN SEE
AS YOU ASCEND A MOUNTAIN IN SOME CASES, A


264
0:32:2,28 --> 0:32:7,98
MARCHING THROUGH OF THESE PHYSIOGNOMIES,
THESE BIOMES THAT YOU SEE AT HIGHER AND HIGHER


265
0:32:7,98 --> 0:32:15,52
LATITUDES. SO YOU WOULD WANT TO DISTINGUISH
THE TRUE TUNDRA OF NORTH AND THE HIGH LATITUDES


266
0:32:15,52 --> 0:32:23,97
AGAINST AN ALPINE TUNDRA THAT YOU WOULD SEE
UP IN A MOUNTAINOUS AREA. LOTS OF HERBACEOUS


267
0:32:23,97 --> 0:32:33,1
GROWTH. NO TREE GROWTH AT ALL. OKAY. LET'S
SWITCH TO THE AQUATIC REALM. MOST BROADLY


268
0:32:33,1 --> 0:32:40,45
WE WANT TO DISTINGUISH FRESHWATER FROM MARINE
WATER BASED ON ITS CONCENTRATION OF SALTS.


269
0:32:40,45 --> 0:32:46,24
AND WITHIN FRESHWATER SYSTEMS, IT'S HELPFUL
TO DISTINGUISH STILL WATER SYSTEMS FROM


270
0:32:46,24 --> 0:32:52,74
FLOWING WATER SYSTEMS. TERMS, FANCY TERMS
IF YOU WANT TO USE THEM. LENTIC AND LOTIC.


271
0:32:52,74 --> 0:33:1,12
THE BOOK USES THEM. I FIND THEM HELPFUL
FOR FLOWING WATER SYSTEMS. THE LOTIC SYSTEMS.


272
0:33:1,12 --> 0:33:11,53
SO, IN A STILL WATER SYSTEM LIKE A LAKE,
WE DIVIDE IT UP IN A SIMPLE WAY. AND THESE


273
0:33:11,53 --> 0:33:16,63
TERMS IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AQUATIC COMMUNITIES,
YOU'LL BE USING THESE TERMS JUST ALL THE


274
0:33:16,63 --> 0:33:22,98
TIME. WE DISTINGUISH THESE SYSTEMS IN TERMS
OF THE LIGHT PENETRATION, SO THE PHOTIC ZONE


275
0:33:22,98 --> 0:33:28,89
WHERE LIGHT DOES PENETRATE AND PHYTOSYNTHESIS
OCCURS WITH THE MAYBE ROOTED PLANTS IN THE


276
0:33:28,89 --> 0:33:37,24
SHALLOWS OR ALGAE AND BACTERIA IN THESE OPEN
AREAS. AND THEN APHOTIC ZONE WHERE THERE'S


277
0:33:37,24 --> 0:33:44,4
LESS LIGHT PENETRATION OR NONE AT ALL AT
THE DEPTHS. ALSO IN TERMS OF THE DISTANCE


278
0:33:44,4 --> 0:33:50,29
FROM THE SHORELINE AND THE DEPTH. SO THE LITTORAL
ZONE IS THIS NEAR SHORE ZONE WHERE YOU GET


279
0:33:50,29 --> 0:34:0,84
THESE ROOTED PLANTS. AND THE  LIMNETIC
ZONE, FURTHER FROM SHORE AND USUALLY DEEPER.


280
0:34:0,84 --> 0:34:5,7
AND LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PELAGIC, YOU'LL
OFTEN HEAR THAT TERM. THE PELAGIC ZONE,


281
0:34:5,7 --> 0:34:17,56
THIS OPEN WATER ZONE AS AGAINST THE BENTHIC
ZONE, THE ZONE ON THE SUBSTRATE ITSELF MARKED


282
0:34:17,56 --> 0:34:24,19
BY THE COMMUNITY OF ORGANISMS CALLED THE
BENTHOS, B-E-N-T-H-O-S, THE BENTHOS. THE UNIQUE


283
0:34:24,19 --> 0:34:33,669
ORGANISMS THAT LIVE IN THE MUCK AND MIRE
AND ON THE SURFACES OF THIS ZONE. FANTASTIC


284
0:34:33,669 --> 0:34:45,2
CREATURES THERE. SO HERE ARE TWO LIMNETIC
SYSTEMS. ONE HIGH ELEVATION SYSTEM WITH


285
0:34:45,2 --> 0:34:52,8
VERY CLEAR WATERS. NOT MUCH VEGETATION GROWTH.
AND ANOTHER SYSTEM WHERE THE WATERS ARE VERY


286
0:34:52,8 --> 0:34:59,56
DARK, CAN'T SEE THE BOTTOM HERE AT ALL.
AND WITH ABUNDANT VEGETATION GROWING IN IT.


287
0:34:59,56 --> 0:35:6,5
BESIDES AN ELEVATIONAL DISTANCE HERE PERHAPS,
LET'S ASSUME THEY'RE AT THE SAME LATITUDE.


288
0:35:6,5 --> 0:35:16,63
THEY COULD BE. WHAT'S ONE DIFFERENCE IN THESE
SYSTEMS IN THE AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT HERE?


289
0:35:16,63 --> 0:35:21,0
SUBSTRATE? WELL, MAYBE THIS IS A ROCKY SUBSTRATE
HERE. YOU JUST CAN'T SEE IT BECAUSE IT'S SO


290
0:35:21,0 --> 0:35:26,76
DARK. THE WATER IS SO DARK. STUDENT: THE
WATER SOURCE. PROFESSOR: THE WATER SOURCE


291
0:35:26,76 --> 0:35:30,98
PROBABLY DIFFERS BUT LET'S JUST SAY THAT
THIS IS FROM STREAMS COMING DOWN OUT OF THESE


292
0:35:30,98 --> 0:35:35,5
HILLS AND THIS ONE, THERE'S HILLS IN THE
FOREGROUND WITH STREAMS ENTERING IT TOO.


293
0:35:35,5 --> 0:35:38,73
STUDENT: TEMPERATURE.


294
0:35:38,73 --> 0:35:42,76
PROFESSOR: TEMPERATURE. IT CERTAINLY LOOKS
WARMER HERE THAN IT DOES THERE. SO THIS IS


295
0:35:42,76 --> 0:35:48,26
SOMEWHAT HIGHER. BUT LET'S FOCUS ON DIFFERENCES
THAT MIGHT EXIST WITHIN THE WATER ITSELF.


296
0:35:48,26 --> 0:35:49,36
THE TEMPERATURE COULD EXIST WITHIN


297
0:35:49,36 --> 0:35:54,37
THE WATER ITSELF. THIS IS PROBABLY A WARMER
BODY OF WATER, I WOULD GUESS FROM APPEARANCES


298
0:35:54,37 --> 0:35:57,17
BUT LET'S ASSUME NOT.


299
0:35:57,17 --> 0:36:3,4
STUDENT: OXYGEN? PROFESSOR: OXYGEN? OXYGEN
IS LIKELY TO DIFFER PARTLY AS A CONSEQUENCE


300
0:36:3,4 --> 0:36:4,7
OF THE THINGS I'M THINKING OF, YES.


301
0:36:4,7 --> 0:36:10,78
STUDENT: LIGHT PENETRATION? PROFESSOR: LIGHT
PENETRATION WILL DIFFER. PARTLY BECAUSE OF


302
0:36:10,78 --> 0:36:15,47
THE VEGETATION AT THE  SURFACES, BUT
ALSO AS A RESULT OF THE LACK OF CLARITY SIGNALING


303
0:36:15,47 --> 0:36:21,18
MORE SEDIMENT AND MORE STUFF IN THE WATER.
YES?


304
0:36:21,18 --> 0:36:22,81
STUDENT: NUTRIENTS?


305
0:36:22,81 --> 0:36:26,88
PROFESSOR: NUTRIENTS IS THE ONE I WAS THINKING
ABOUT FIRSTLY. BUT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF DIFFERENCES


306
0:36:26,88 --> 0:36:35,3
IN NUTRIENTS A LOT OF THE OTHER THINGS YOU
GUYS MENTIONED WOULD BE TRUE ALSO. NUTRIENTS


307
0:36:35,3 --> 0:36:43,51
ARE TYPICALLY THE MAJOR LIMITING FACTOR IN
THE PRODUCTIVITY OF AQUATIC SYSTEMS. WHICH


308
0:36:43,51 --> 0:36:49,4
NUTRIENT IT IS MAY DIFFER SYSTEM TO SYSTEM
BUT IT'S USUALLY NUTRIENTS. AND THIS SYSTEM


309
0:36:49,4 --> 0:36:58,93
IS POOR IN NUTRIENTS. AND AS A RESULT HAS
LITTLE VEGETATIVE GROWTH. LITTLE LESS BIOLOGICAL


310
0:36:58,93 --> 0:37:5,6
ACTIVITY IN GENERAL. AS A RESULT OF LESS
BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY, THERE'S GOING TO BE GREATER


311
0:37:5,6 --> 0:37:12,62
AMOUNT OF OXYGEN AVAILABLE, LESS USED BY THE
RESPIRATION OF THE ORGANISMS. THIS SYSTEM


312
0:37:12,62 --> 0:37:19,11
WITH MUCH MORE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY, LESS
OXYGEN IN THE DEPTHS, IT HAS MORE NUTRIENTS.


313
0:37:19,11 --> 0:37:24,82
AND OUR TERMS WE NEED ARE OLIGOTROPHIC AND
EUTROPHIC. OLIGOTROPHIC AND EUTROPHIC.


314
0:37:24,82 --> 0:37:34,56
I THINK AT LEAST EUTROPHIC IS HERE. A GREAT
EXPERIMENT, A CLASSIC EXPERIMENT IN ECOLOGY


315
0:37:34,56 --> 0:37:43,7
SHOWED THE IMPORTANCE OF NUTRIENT INPUTS TO
LAKES BY DIVIDING THIS SORT OF DUMBBELL-SHAPED


316
0:37:43,7 --> 0:37:53,94
LAKE AT THE MIDDLE AND PUTTING NUTRIENTS
INTO BOTH SIDES OF LAKE. NITROGEN, CARBON,


317
0:37:53,94 --> 0:38:2,21
AND PHOSPHORUS INTO THIS SIDE. SORRY, NITROGEN,
CARBON AND PHOSPHORUS INTO THIS SIDE. AND


318
0:38:2,21 --> 0:38:9,2
ONLY NITROGEN AND CARBON INTO THIS SIDE.
THIS IS UP IN NORTHERN CANADA. AND THIS WAS


319
0:38:9,2 --> 0:38:14,89
AT A TIME WHEN LAKES WERE SEEN TO BE SHOWING
THESE KINDS OF EFFECTS WHERE YOU HAD BLOOMS


320
0:38:14,89 --> 0:38:22,62
OF ALGAE OR BLOOMS OF BACTERIA, IN PARTICULAR
CYANOBACTERIA IN PARTICULARLY IN POLLUTED


321
0:38:22,62 --> 0:38:28,6
WATERS. AND IT WAS OF BIG CONCERN TO PEOPLE
WHEN YOUR WATERS GO FROM BEING CLEAR AND


322
0:38:28,6 --> 0:38:35,93
SWIMMABLE TO CHOKED WITH UNDESIRABLE GROWTH.
AND WHAT THESE INVESTIGATORS SHOWED SO


323
0:38:35,93 --> 0:38:42,32
  STARKLY WAS THE ROLE OF PHOSPHORUS AND
PHOSPHATES AS A LIMITING NUTRIENT. PHOSPHORUS


324
0:38:42,32 --> 0:38:48,22
AS A LIMITING NUTRIENT. THAT WHEN INPUT COULD
CAUSE THESE TYPES OF BLOOMS THAT WOULD ABSOLUTELY


325
0:38:48,22 --> 0:38:57,21
CHOKE OTHER ORGANISMS OUT AS A RESULT OF DEPLETION
OF OXYGEN AND ALTERATION IN THE PHOTIC ZONE.


326
0:38:57,21 --> 0:39:2,4
AND PHOSPHORUS WAS ENTERING WATERWAYS AS
A RESULT OF SEWAGE INPUT AND RUNOFF FROM FARMS


327
0:39:2,4 --> 0:39:8,22
AND DETERGENTS THAT WERE HEAVY IN PHOSPHATES,
MAKING THEIR WAY INTO WATER SUPPLIES AND INTO


328
0:39:8,22 --> 0:39:16,2
LOCAL WATERS. AND WHEN THESE IMAGES WERE
SHOWED IN CONGRESS THEY HAD A BIG RIPPLING


329
0:39:16,2 --> 0:39:25,4
EFFECT ON OUR LAWS ABOUT DETERGENTS AND
POLLUTION. HERE'S A LOVELY EUTROPHIC SYSTEM


330
0:39:25,4 --> 0:39:29,14
SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD. I DON'T KNOW WHERE.
I JUST LIKE THE PICTURE. I LIKE THESE SYSTEMS


331
0:39:29,14 --> 0:39:36,79
ALSO. SAVANNAS I LIKE, BUT PARTICULARLY
THESE WETLAND SYSTEMS AT THE ECOTONE. AT THE


332
0:39:36,79 --> 0:39:42,33
ECOTONE BETWEEN  WATER AND LAND. OFTEN YOUR
SAVANNA IS BACK BEHIND HERE IN AFRICA. YOU


333
0:39:42,33 --> 0:39:49,9
HAVE A RIM OF TREES, VEGETATION, A RIPARIAN
ZONE IF THIS WERE A FLOWING BODY. AND THEN


334
0:39:49,9 --> 0:40:0,4
THIS ECOTONE, THIS INTERFACE, BETWEEN WATER
AND LAND. THAT'S THE SYSTEM I STUDY IN AFRICA.


335
0:40:0,4 --> 0:40:7,83
OKAY. SO A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF FLOWING SYSTEMS.
OF COURSE, A BIG RIVER LIKE THIS STARTS


336
0:40:7,83 --> 0:40:11,51
AS A BUNCH OF LITTLE CREEKS AND STREAMS
AND SMALLER RIVERS THAT GATHER TOGETHER TO


337
0:40:11,51 --> 0:40:17,39
FORM BIG A RIVER. RIGHT? AND YOU MIGHT IMAGINE
THE ORGANISMS THAT OCCUPY A SYSTEM LIKE


338
0:40:17,39 --> 0:40:20,85
THIS AND A SYSTEM LIKE THIS DIFFER A LOT FROM
ONES IN LAKES.


339
0:40:20,85 --> 0:40:23,49
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT PHYSICAL FORCES TO
DEAL WITH.


340
0:40:23,49 --> 0:40:29,3
FLOWING WATER IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM STILL
WATER. ULTIMATELY THE RIVER IS GOING TO


341
0:40:29,3 --> 0:40:35,36
FLOW INTO THE SEA TYPICALLY. THERE ARE COUNTER-EXAMPLES
BUT MOST RIVERS FLOW ULTIMATELY TO THE SEA.


342
0:40:35,36 --> 0:40:40,22
AND AT THE COAST THEY MAY FORM DELTAS LIKE
THIS WHERE THEY BACK UP AND FORM CHANNELS.


343
0:40:40,22 --> 0:40:41,3
IT'S A DELTA SYSTEM,


344
0:40:41,3 --> 0:40:49,1
DELTAIC SYSTEM. AND AN ESTUARY, THIS AREA
WHERE, THIS AREA INFLUENCED BY THE TIDES


345
0:40:49,1 --> 0:40:54,72
OF THE OCEAN WHERE YOU GET SOME SALTWATER
INPUT, SOME MARINE INPUT BUT WITH CONTINUOUS


346
0:40:54,72 --> 0:41:3,83
FRESHWATER OUTPUT IS A MIXED WATER SYSTEM,
A BRACKISH SYSTEM IF YOU WANT THAT WE CALL


347
0:41:3,83 --> 0:41:7,91
AN ESTUARY. AND THEY'RE VERY PRODUCTIVE
SYSTEMS, THESE ESTUARIES. HIGH NUTRIENT INPUT


348
0:41:7,91 --> 0:41:16,87
FROM THE  CONTINENTAL SURFACE AND ORGANISMS
AND SALTS FROM THE OCEAN MINGLING TOGETHER


349
0:41:16,87 --> 0:41:23,0
AND ESPECIALLY IN TROPICAL ENVIRONMENT.
THIS IS A RECIPE FOR A LOT OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY.


350
0:41:23,0 --> 0:41:29,8
MARINE ZONES WE DIVIDE UP MUCH LIKE WE DO
THE FRESHWATER ZONES IN TERMS OF LIGHT PENETRATION.


351
0:41:29,8 --> 0:41:36,4
PHOTIC AND APHOTIC. DISTANCE FROM SHORE. JUST
SWAP TERMS A LITTLE BIT. NERITIC ZONE, THE


352
0:41:36,4 --> 0:41:44,5
OCEANIC ZONE. AND AGAIN OPEN WATER OR BOTTOM,
PELAGIC AND BENTHIC. SO THOSE ARE THE SAME.


353
0:41:44,5 --> 0:41:50,44
THOSE TERMS ARE THE SAME. THE CONTINENTAL
SHELF. AND THE INTERTIDAL ZONE. THE INTERTIDAL


354
0:41:50,44 --> 0:41:56,35
IS REMEMBER IS JUST THAT ZONE BETWEEN THE
UPPERMOST HIGH TIDE AND THE LOWER MOST LOW


355
0:41:56,35 --> 0:42:2,31
TIDE WITH ITS CHARACTERISTIC ORGANISMS.
AND IN SOME WAYS YOU CAN CONSIDER THIS AN


356
0:42:2,31 --> 0:42:8,58
ECOTONAL SYSTEM, AN ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM BETWEEN
TWO OTHER MAJOR SYSTEMS, AN OCEANIC ONE


357
0:42:8,58 --> 0:42:14,44
AND A TERRESTRIAL ONE. IT'S AN INTERTIDAL
SYSTEM. THAT TERM ECOTONE I WON'T FORMALLY


358
0:42:14,44 --> 0:42:19,51
DEFINE BUT HOPEFULLY YOU ARE GETTING THE IDEA
OF WHAT I MEAN BY IT.


359
0:42:19,51 --> 0:42:25,45
AN INTERTIDAL SYSTEM. PISASTER PERHAPS. THEY
ARE YOUR MUSSELS AND BARNACLES, YOUR ALGAE,


360
0:42:25,45 --> 0:42:31,47
NICE SYSTEM WITH YOUR KEYSTONE PREDATOR
PRESENT. BEAUTIFUL ANEMONES. YOU CAN SEE THIS


361
0:42:31,47 --> 0:42:32,81
RIGHT DOWN COAST HERE.


362
0:42:32,81 --> 0:42:40,47
YOU CAN SEE TIDE POOLS LIKE THIS ON OUR COAST.
AND I URGE YOU


363
0:42:40,47 --> 0:42:45,34
TO GO CHECK THEM OUT. AND CORAL REEFS, OF
COURSE, JUST OFF-SHORE, THESE SHALLOW WATER


364
0:42:45,34 --> 0:42:53,7
REEFS THAT RECEIVE SO MUCH SOLAR INPUT AS
WELL AS NUTRIENTS COMING OFF OF THE OCEANS.


365
0:42:53,7 --> 0:42:59,61
OCCURRING IN WATERS THAT ARE VERY NUTRIENT
POOR TYPICALLY. TROPICAL WATERS, YOU GO TO


366
0:42:59,61 --> 0:43:3,4
YOU BEAUTIFUL TROPICAL BEACH WITH YOUR PALM
TREE BEHIND YOU AND YOU'RE SIPPING ON YOUR


367
0:43:3,4 --> 0:43:10,18
DRINK AND GAZING ON THE LOVELY BLUEGREEN
SEA THAT YOU CAN SNORKEL IN AND SEE 25 FEET


368
0:43:10,18 --> 0:43:15,61
DOWN TO THE BOTTOM. IT'S SO CLEAR AND BEAUTIFUL,
THAT WATER, PARTLY BECAUSE IT'S SO NUTRIENT


369
0:43:15,61 --> 0:43:22,73
POOR AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE GROWTH. BUT
THEN YOU CROSS THE LAGOON AND YOU'RE ON A


370
0:43:22,73 --> 0:43:29,51
REEF LIKE THIS, THAT'S JUST A RIOT OF BIOLOGICAL
ACTIVITY. HOW CAN YOU GROW A REEF LIKE THIS


371
0:43:29,51 --> 0:43:39,91
IN NUTRIENT POOR WATERS? I PUT AN ARTICLE
RELATED TO  THAT ON BSPACE IN THAT


372
0:43:39,91 --> 0:43:45,87
NEWS FOLDER. SO PLEASE READ ABOUT IT THERE.
IT'S REQUIRED READING. JUST A SHORT NATIONAL


373
0:43:45,87 --> 0:43:55,32
GEOGRAPHIC ARTICLE. IT CAN HELP YOU UNDERSTAND
OR AT LEAST THE HYPOTHESIS FOR HOW THAT WORKS.


374
0:43:55,32 --> 0:44:1,3
CHLOROPHYL, PLANTS THAT RELY ON CHLOROPHYL
FOR PHOTOSYNTHESIS ABSORBS


375
0:44:1,3 --> 0:44:10,31
VISIBLE LIGHT AND TENDS TO REFLECT OTHER WAVE
LENGTHS OF LIGHT LIKE INFRARED LIGHT. WHEREAS


376
0:44:10,31 --> 0:44:15,13
PHYSICAL SURFACES, NON-GROWING SURFACES
REFLECT LIGHT DIFFERENTLY. SO YOU CAN TAKE


377
0:44:15,13 --> 0:44:23,6
SATELLITE IMAGES OF THE EARTH AND MAP AND
TRANSLATE REFLECTANCE OF LIGHT, OF WAVE


378
0:44:23,6 --> 0:44:31,9
LENGTHS OF LIGHT INTO DIFFERENT SUBSTRATE
TYPES, VEGETATION VERSUS STONE VERSUS SAND.


379
0:44:31,9 --> 0:44:36,66
IT REFLECTS NOT ONLY THE VEGETATION BUT
PRODUCTIVITY. SO IN A SATELLITE IMAGE LIKE


380
0:44:36,66 --> 0:44:42,79
THIS, I DON'T HAVE WHAT THE SCALE BAR IS
HERE, BUT THIS IS MEASURED IN SOMETHING


381
0:44:42,79 --> 0:44:50,44
LIKE KILOGRAMS OF CARBON PER UNIT SPACE. YOU
CAN GET A SENSE FOR HOW PRODUCTIVE THESE


382
0:44:50,44 --> 0:44:57,39
SURFACES OF THE WORLD ARE. THE GRAY HERE
IS NO NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY LESS THAN ZERO


383
0:44:57,39 --> 0:45:3,81
NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY IN THIS GREAT DESERT
OR ON THESE POLAR CONDITIONS. AND YOUR REDS


384
0:45:3,81 --> 0:45:11,31
AND YELLOWS ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE AREAS AND
SO FORTH. THE OCEAN TENDS TO BE VERY LOW IN


385
0:45:11,31 --> 0:45:17,65
PRODUCTIVITY WITH SOME HUGE DEAD ZONES IN
TERMS OF PRODUCTIVITY. BUT BECAUSE OF ITS


386
0:45:17,65 --> 0:45:24,5
ENORMOUS SIZE, THE OCEAN HAS ALMOST AS MUCH
PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AS THE LAND SURFACE


387
0:45:24,5 --> 0:45:31,99
JUST BECAUSE IT'S SO BIG. BUT NOTE CAREFULLY
HOW LOW IN PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY IT IS. AND


388
0:45:31,99 --> 0:45:38,59
THIS IS PRIMARILY A CONSEQUENCE OF NUTRIENT
LIMITATIONS. IT'S MOST PRODUCTIVE ON COASTAL


389
0:45:38,59 --> 0:45:44,54
SHELVES WHERE YOU EITHER HAVE UP-WELLING
OF DEEP WATER ORGANIC NUTRIENTS OR THE FLOWING


390
0:45:44,54 --> 0:45:53,55
OFF OF NUTRIENTS FROM THE CONTINENTS THEMSELVES.
AND THIS I'LL LET YOU READ CAREFULLY. IT


391
0:45:53,55 --> 0:45:59,61
BREAKS DOWN VARIOUS ECOSYSTEM TYPES AND BIOMES
IN RELATION TO THE PERCENTAGE OF THE EARTH'S


392
0:45:59,61 --> 0:46:4,42
SURFACE THEY OCCUPY  AND THEIR AVERAGE
NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY. AND YOU CAN SEE


393
0:46:4,42 --> 0:46:11,59
THAT SOME SYSTEMS LIKE SWAMPS AND MARSHS
OR ALGO BEDS AND REEFS ARE VERY PRODUCTIVE


394
0:46:11,59 --> 0:46:17,15
BUT THEY JUST DON'T OCCUPY MUCH OF THE EARTH'S
SURFACE. SO IN TERMS OF EARTH'S TOTAL PRIMARY


395
0:46:17,15 --> 0:46:21,84
PRODUCTIVITY THEY'RE FAIRLY LOW. AND THE
TROPICAL RAINFORESTS BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH


396
0:46:21,84 --> 0:46:29,85
SO PRODUCTIVE AND SO NUMEROUS IN TERMS OF
SPACE THEY OCCUPY, THEY ACCOUNT FOR SO MUCH


397
0:46:29,85 --> 0:46:39,4
OF EARTH'S PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY.


398
0:46:39,4 --> 0:46:43,21
I'M LOSING YOU GUYS. SO YOU CAN STUDY THESE
THINGS ON YOUR OWN TIME AND READ ABOUT THEM


399
0:46:43,21 --> 0:48:43,21
IN THE BOOK. ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU NEXT TIME.
