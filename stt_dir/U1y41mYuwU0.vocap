###11 -In the last while, it's actually calmed
###13 down quite a bit.
###14 I haven't heard of that many kidnappings lately.
###17 You know, usually it was like, boom.
###19 Every other day, oh my goodness.
###21 There was another kidnapping, you know?
###22 The Joneses got kidnapped, Romney got
###24 kidnapped, or you know--
###26 just someone you affiliated with.
###28 -Now, it's hard to picture a place that's so fucked up that
###31 not that many kidnappings is a sign that
###33 things are going well.
###34 But in northern Mexico, everything is relative.
###37 The sobering reality of it is, in Mexico in 2011 there were
###41 49 kidnappings a day.
###44 -Things have actually kind of calmed down enough to where
###46 they actually have parties and rodeos and whatnot.
###49 
###56 -So they're having this rodeo because a dude lost his leg?
###59 -Yeah, one of the cowboys lost his leg and they're doing a
###63 benefit for him.
###64 -Right.
###65 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###66 
###70 -One of the things that we were worried about before we
###73 came here was people knowing that we were here.
###75 People knowing that we were shooting.
###76 And now we're in front of the whole town.
###78 -There you go.
###78 -In a town where they used to have three or four
###80 kidnappings a week.
###81 And we're just parading in front of everyone with a
###84 camera going, turn the music off, [INAUDIBLE].
###85 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###86 
###90 -They've just announced to the whole town
###92 that we're here shooting.
###94 In the most dangerous town in Chihuahua.
###95 
###106 I'm just going to get drunk.
###108 
###113 -Woo!
###113 Put that on.
###116 SHANE (NARRATING): Now, hanging out with the LeBarons
###117 and playacting as a cowpoke relaxed us a little bit.
###120 As did the booze.
###121 -I'd like to say cheers to the LeBaron family because you
###123 guys fucking rock.
###125 -To the LeBaron family.
###126 -LeBaron Family.
###127 -Good times, good friends.
###128 -Salud.
###129 -Cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers.
###131 [HOWLING LIKE WOLVES]
###140 [SINGING IN SPANISH]
###146 SHANE (NARRATING): We had a nice lunch, got a bit drunk,
###148 and sang some songs together.
###151 It was fun.
###152 [SINGING IN SPANISH]
###167 SHANE (NARRATING): After drinking for a bit with Brent,
###169 he suggested we go on a ride-along on the nightly
###171 patrol of the LeBaron colony.
###175 Now, I was picturing a pickup truck with a CB and a couple
###178 of good old boys in the back.
###179 But we got instead was some heavy, heavy business.
###182 
###189 SHANE (OFFSCREEN): What are we doing right now?
###191 -So we're just going to take on a routine route that they
###195 normally take.
###196 And then they'll probably do a security checkpoint for a
###199 little while and maybe check some
###202 suspicious vehicles or something.
###203 
###220 These guys use our town as a base because they trust
###223 everyone here.
###224 -One of things that's pretty crazy is you're driving
###227 through with pickup trucks with four armed guards in the
###230 back and two guys in the front, all with machine guns,
###233 for a town of 1,200 people.
###234 So shit is serious.
###236 
###242 SHANE (NARRATING): So the federales
###243 kept stopping people.
###244 And they didn't seem to mind us riding along with them
###246 until they roadblocked the actual highway, which,
###248 remember, is one of the main drug routes into America.
###251 -The cops are going to stop some cars and
###253 look for some drugs.
###256 Then as the sun was going down, they warned us that we
###258 should leave because it was very dangerous to even
###260 be seen with them.
###261 Because as it turned out, riding around with them on the
###263 back roads is one thing.
###265 But stopping actual drug runners on
###266 the highway was another.
###268 
###275 SHANE (OFFSCREEN): Want a beer?
###276 -Yeah.
###277 SHANE (NARRATING): Back at the hotel, we realized that our
###278 fun, boozy afternoon had some unforeseen consequences.
###283 About an hour ago, a black pickup sort of drove by really
###286 slowly and then kind of sped off.
###289 SHANE (NARRATING): Black trucks like the ones Julian
###290 had pointed out earlier had actually stopped, taken
###293 pictures, and checked us out.
###296 And all a sudden, our LeBaron run around town drunk time
###300 didn't seem so smart anymore.
###301 -All right.
###302 So we have to leave now because we shot today at the
###305 rodeo and then we did a drive-by with the cops, so
###308 everybody in town knows that we're here.
###310 And then we've just have a black truck with black windows
###313 stop, pull up, check us out, and then drive off.
###316 And a black truck, I just found out, came by and took
###318 pictures of us before I got here.
###321 So we have to go to another hotel that we've arranged,
###323 which is crazy.
###325 SHANE (NARRATING): So we took off.
###327 And when we called Brent to tell him we had left, I half
###329 expected him to say hey, you're overreacting.
###331 It's nothing.
###332 But in actual fact, when he heard the
###333 story, he said, oh yeah.
###335 You should get the fuck out of Dodge.
###336 
###342 -Who do you think should be the next president of the
###345 United States?
###346 -Mitt Romney has a great, great policy.
###348 His family lives right across the mountain here.
###351 SHANE (NARRATING): Now, when Brent says "his family," he
###353 means presidential candidate Mitt Romney's family.
###358 -Mitt is a relative.
###360 He's a second cousin.
###362 I wish Mitt would make contact with us, and I really think
###364 that we could help him.
###366
