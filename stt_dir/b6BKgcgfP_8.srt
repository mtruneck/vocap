1
0:0:4,8 --> 0:0:7,6
Oh baby elephant, you're such a hoot!


2
0:0:7,6 --> 0:0:11,29
You're so darn wrinkly and so darn cute!


3
0:0:11,29 --> 0:0:15,219
Whether clowning with your bestest bud,


4
0:0:15,219 --> 0:0:19,7
or trying to climb out of the mud,


5
0:0:19,7 --> 0:0:22,98
Or wrestling on a dry lake bed,


6
0:0:22,98 --> 0:0:28,279
or playing with stuff on top of your head.


7
0:0:28,279 --> 0:0:31,73
You show us humans we've gone astray,


8
0:0:31,73 --> 0:0:36,479
Life is fun, come on, let's play.


9
0:0:36,479 --> 0:0:39,65
Don't be afraid if you feel a whim,


10
0:0:39,65 --> 0:0:45,21
Jump right in, and take a swim.


11
0:0:45,21 --> 0:0:48,94
Find a pal and mix it up,


12
0:0:48,94 --> 0:0:52,82
And if you end up completely stuck,


13
0:0:52,82 --> 0:0:58,26
Give one last push, one last big spring,


14
0:0:58,26 --> 0:2:58,26
Then show your trunk, and wave that thing.
