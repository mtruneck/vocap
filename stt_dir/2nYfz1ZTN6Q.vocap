###1 Life just couldn't seem to get this evolution thing right: Did it start on land,
###5 or the sea? And just how many times did it cross over from land to sea? And why
###12 should we believe the fishy fishapod story?  this is Genesis Week.

###80 Today we're going to cover a composite of several news items from the past week.
###84 The first article, loaded with a lot of evolutionary assumptions and written by
###88 Mulkidjanian et al appeared in PNAS. Citing the problems of life arising in the
###96 oceans, as well as a contrast of the chemical composition of what is believed
###100 to be the first life, with the chemical content in the water of hot springs on
###103 land.  Their conclusion: the first life must have started in hot springs on land and
###109 not the ocean.  Now there are a few problematic facts here: no one was there
###114 at the beginning to  get a sample of the first life, so the organisms of which they
###118 were comparing chemical composition are assumed to have been the first life.  Such
###125 assumptions are also ignoring the glaring issues of chemicals assembling into life in
###129 direct violation of scientific and natural laws. Then there are the other
###132 evolutionary scientists who claimed that land was inhospitable for life 3.8 billion
###137 years ago due to meteor bombardment, therefore life had to have started in the
###143 oceans!
###144 Only a couple of weeks prior to the PNAS article, the South African Journal of
###148 Science carried a report by Brain,et al, on what is claimed to be our earliest animal
###153 ancestor - a sponge allegedly 760 million years old.  This fossil sponge was found in
###161 limestone which evolutionary geologists have deduced was deposited on the
###165 ocean floor, so obviously this sponge lived in the ocean.
###171 Still yet another article of interest came out this past week in The Proceedings of
###175 the Royal Society by Vega and Wiens who, using cladistic comparisons,
###180 concluded that the majority of saltwater fishes evolved from freshwater fish
###185 ancestors.  I'm going to ignore all of the evolutionary assumptions involved here,
###190 as cladistics do not prove nor disprove evolution, they are simply interpreted
###194 within the evolutionary paradigm, and evolution was simply assumed within the
###199 comparisons.  But let's assume for the moment that they are correct.
###203 You'll also recall a couple of weeks back where I mentioned a British Museum of
###207 Natural History article talking about the venerable Horseshoe crab. I pointed out
###212 how it hasn't changed in some 450 million years according to the evolutionary
###217 timescale.  The British Museum article even pointed out that the horseshoe crab
###221 has remained unchanged even though it survived 3 of earth's major extinction
###226 events!  Several people objected vociferously to my comments, citing the
###231 usual evolutionary mantra that change only occurs because of environmental
###236 pressures - the horseshoe crab saw no change in its environment, therefore it did
###240 not change!
###242 Really? Well try to tell that to the trilobites who are now apparently extinct, yet lived
###248 in the same environment, right alongside the horseshoe crabs. But better yet - let's
###254 examine the coelacanth, which also lived in the ocean, unchanged,  in some 407
###260 million years as it is still around today - yet the coelacanth was consdiered part of
###265 the line of fishapod ancestors - the half fish/half tetrapod line.  You know - the
###270 evolutionary descent where the fish grew legs and walked up onto land to become
###274 land dwelling creatures? So, did the coelacanth change, or didn't it? Did it
###281 experience environmental pressures to change? Or didn't it?
###286 According to the evolution myth, once land creatures evolved, they got bored of
###289 the land and went back into the sea, evolving into sea creatures.  Last fall,
###295 Motani delivered a paper at the Society for Vertebrate Paleontology showing how
###299 it appears that the plesiasaurs and ichthyosaurs evolved their way back into
###304 the seas from an unknown, cold-blooded ancestor, in tropical areas.  It's simply
###309 assumed that plesiasaurs and ichthyosaurs were cold blooded cause
###313 nobody has actually checked the body temperature of a living plesiasaur or
###317 ichthyosaur. (ichty screams)  For some reason, cold blooded marine reptiles, dolphins, whales,
###322 and 28 other groups of marine creatures all evolved back into ocean dwelling
###328 creatures from land animals, according to the evolution myth.
###332 So - before we go any farther, let us line up all of these reports to paint an
###338 evolutionary picture thus far.  I mean no offense to my evolutionary friends, but
###343 you need to see just how ridiculous the story has become:
###349 According to all of this latest and greatest evolutionary research, the first life arose
###353 in warm ponds or perhaps hot springs on land.  This first life somehow survived the
###358 alleged heavy meteor bombardment of earth.  Perhaps this life was blasted out of
###364 the hot springs and into the ocean - I don't know, I wasn't there and neither
###367 were you. All we do "know" is that somehow THIS life wound up in the
###373 oceans and evolved into a sponge.  That sponge allegedly evolved into a fish,
###379 which decided it preferred freshwater instead of salt water, and moved into the
###382 rivers, streams and lakes of the continents.  It diversified. Apparently
###386 those fish got bored and went back out into the ocean, where after diversifying
###390 some more, got bored of the ocean, grew legs and walked up onto land.  These land
###395 creatures diversified and some of those land creatures got bored and decided
###398 they wanted to live in the oceans again, so they evolved into sea dwelling
###402 creatures.  31 different times 31 different groups of land creatures evolved into sea
###413 creatures.
###415 All this time, the horseshoe crab, sea pens, tadpole shrimp, bristle worms,
###421 limpits, sea lancelets, sea anenomes, stromatalites, jellyfish, and fishes like the
###427 coelacanth, didn't evolve whatsoever.
###431 In fact that transition from fish to landlubber is an interesting tale which I've
###436 discussed on the show before. The coelacanth was considered to be the
###439 precursor to the tetrapod, because of its four, large lobed fins - CLEARLY a fish
###444 attempting to evolve legs to walk on land! This was believed in spite of the fact that
###449 the coelacanth doesn't even have a spine - it has a notochord - which is like a
###453 rubber tube in place of a spine.  The coelacanth vanishes from the fossil
###457 record at the end of what is called the cretaceous - or about 65 million years ago
###461 according to the evolutionary timescale. Assumed extinct, it was sensational to
###466 find them alive, swimming off the coast of Africa in the 1930's. This was just as
###473 stunning as finding a stegasaurus nibbling on your garden vegetables.
###476 There it was - living in very deep water with absolutely no interest in walking on
###482 land.  And if it was still around unchanged, then that would mean it had nothing to do
###488 with fishapod evolution.
###491 However, evolutionists believed they had a pretty good fossil sequence of fish to
###494 tetrapod - a four legged amphibian.  Now, ignoring the speculative nature of off it,
###499 there was a missing link if you will, a gap in the sequence, right at the 375 million
###508 year mark.  So Neil Shubin from the U of Chicago, took a team up to the Canadian
###513 high arctic in 2004 to go looking for this missing link in 375 million year old rock.
###521 They found what they believed they were looking for - Tiktaalik.
###525 Tiktaalik was heralded as such a stunning discovery - and victory - for evolution,
###530 after all, evolution had actually made a prediction and it was fulfilled!
###536 The anti-creation blog the sensuous curmugeon went hog wild over Tiktaalik
###541 saying in their August 10, 2009 blog post:
###569 Actually, it is the scientific evidence that prohibits one species evolving into
###574 another, but I digress They referred to what they said in a
###578 previous, July 7 post of the same year discussing the spectacular Tiktaalik find :
###640 Wow! Slam dunk right? Not only did they have what sure looked like an impressive
###645 sequence of fossil transition from fish to tetrapod, they even made a prediction
###652 based on evolutionary theory and found a fishapod to fill in the gap!
###658 But neither geology nor evolutionary theory predicted what had already been
###666 discovered in 2002 - before the discovery of Tiktaalik - fossil tetrapod footprints in
###673 rocks dated by evolutionary geologists as 395 million years old.  OOoooops!
###682 So based on the evolutionary assumptions, tetrapods were obviously
###688 already around with fully formed legs, wrists, feet, toes, etc., before ANY of the
###693 fishapods that were allegedly trying to evolve legs, wrists, feet and toes.
###699 Some have tried to desperately salvage Tiktaalik, saying "Oh maybe the age is off
###704 a little bit" - for example, the Royal Tyrell Museum in Drumheller Alberta
###708 mysteriously has Tiktaalik's age listed as 400 million years old - even everyone else
###713 lists its age as 375 million years old.  While there's a lot of women out there who
###719 would love to be able to change their age like that, changing Tiktaalik's age does
###723 not fix the problem.  You can't change the date of Tiktaalik without abandoning the
###728 alleged "predictions" that evolution and evolutionary geology made. You can't
###733 change the date of Tiktaalik without changing the date of all the other
###740 fishapods. And if you were wrong on all of those dates, then where on earth are you
###745 getting these dates? Clearly your dating and assembly of the fossils cannot be
###750 trusted! The Polish footprints didn't just throw Tiktaalik out of the evolutionary
###755 tree - it threw out all of these fishapods.
###760 The sensuous curmugeon finished off their August 2009 post with the question
###773 Now that the Poland fossil footprints have thoroughly destroyed all the predictions
###776 of evolution and has completely falsified the fishy fishapod story, and
###781 simultaneously refuted the validity of both geology and evolution theory, will the
###786 anti-creationists to whom this is explained be convinced? Alas, probably not. But at
###793 least you'll know you gave it a good try. As I mentioned previously, and as you can
###797 see here today, the evolution myth will conform to whatever evidence you give it.
###803 Therefore evolution is not falsifiable, therefore, it is not science. It is, as the
###809 Apostle Paul wrote: "'science,' falsely so called." Evolution is a myth.

###821 Wahoo! Mail for me?
###825 (beeping timer sound)
###829 Hmmmm...I forget - am I supposed to cut the blue wire, or the red wire?
###835 Or, maybe I'll just pull the detonator!
###838 [Scary, dramatic music]
###841 I was SOOOo excited about Darwin's birthday last weekend that I accidentally
###845 got my dates mixed up and celebrated his birthday a day early. His birthday was
###849 Sunday, not Saturday as I said in last week's show.  Well done to those who
###852 caught this mistake and somehow think its discredits me when I get my days
###856 mixed up.  Hey - at least I'm not off by 20 million years.
###860 I'd like to give a special shout out to callingheyzeus who was sharing his
###865 testimony in the comments last week - kudos. It takes courage to share like that,
###869 and also to youtuber pumpstations for sharing their story. I commend you both
###873 for your courage, and I'm sorry you had to put up with the typical youtube trolls
###877 who selfishly butt in with incredible insensitivity.
###889 Let me see what I can do - there is copyright issues involved. I'm allowed to
###891 post it in some forms due to fair use, but I would definitely need permission to post
###895 the whole article.  I also apologize for the delay in getting the newsletter out, I
###899 wanted to add some more of the original photos, and I only got permission to
###903 reproduce them a couple of days ago.
###946 Actually - I agree, don't take my word for anything - do your own research. In fact,
###951 research the claims of what others like BandofAtheist say, so you can see where
###956 they are lying and misleading people.  I'm ready, willing and able to back up my
###959 commentary, you can verify the facts for yourself! by the way - if you're going to use
###964 the internet: trueorigin.org, creationwiki.org, great resources for further research.
###1014 Uhhh. I have never, ever claimed to be a professor - ever. Now some people call
###1022 me by the nicknames of professor Juby, Doctor Juby and Doc Juby. Nicknames
###1027 that were given to me by another teacher at the high school I taught at 17 years
###1030 ago!  Students from that school, friends and even the Vice Principal still call me
###1035 Doc Juby! Sorry, but someone else giving me an affectionate or respectful nickname
###1040 does not make me a liar.
###1068 Thank you for the clarification.  If you'll recall however, as Dr. Criswell explained:
###1082 so the point remains the same.
###1085 The comments always take fascinating rabbit trails, as this week several
###1089 youtubers got to debating genetics: TCchapman500 quoted and responded to
###1095 TheScienceFoundation:
###1175 And as I point out in my "Natural selection" rant - natural selection doesn't
###1180 work the way evolution needs it to!
###1182 I've decided to leave ratings turned on for the whining anti-creationists.  I discovered
###1188 that much to their dismay, ratings really do not affect the viewership....at all......  So
###1194 there you go! Rate and rant away!  Thanks to all who gave input on that matter.
###1200 That's enough for this week, I'm your host Ian Juby, I hope you'll join me next
###1205 Thursday for the next episode of Genesis Week, and hopefully I'll finally get caught
###1209 up and get some more videos out here shortly. So make sure you subscribe up
