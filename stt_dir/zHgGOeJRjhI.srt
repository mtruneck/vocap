2
0:0:17,31 --> 0:0:18,8
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: I don't
ever cook stuff that I


3
0:0:18,8 --> 0:0:20,895
don't want to eat.


4
0:0:20,895 --> 0:0:22,7
I cook for my soul.


5
0:0:22,7 --> 0:0:24,35
I cook for my heart.


6
0:0:24,35 --> 0:0:27,47
If I don't feel it's right,
I won't put it on.


7
0:0:27,47 --> 0:0:28,72
I have very high standards.


8
0:0:28,72 --> 0:0:30,77



9
0:0:30,77 --> 0:0:31,95
I'm April Bloomfield.


10
0:0:31,95 --> 0:0:36,35
I'm the co-owner of the Spotted
Pig, the Breslin, and


11
0:0:36,35 --> 0:0:37,78
the John Dory.


12
0:0:37,78 --> 0:0:41,87
This is Ken Friedman,
my partner in crime.


13
0:0:41,87 --> 0:0:48,5



14
0:0:48,5 --> 0:0:51,15
I realized that I wanted
to be a chef when I was


15
0:0:51,15 --> 0:0:52,44
just turning 16.


16
0:0:52,44 --> 0:0:55,47
I hadn't got into my chosen
profession, which was I wanted


17
0:0:55,47 --> 0:0:56,91
to be a policewoman.


18
0:0:56,91 --> 0:0:59,54
I saw my sister walk in, and
she had her chef whites on,


19
0:0:59,54 --> 0:1:2,82
and come back from a shift,
looking a bit grubby but very


20
0:1:2,82 --> 0:1:5,209
professional, and I was like,
maybe I'll do that.


21
0:1:5,209 --> 0:1:6,459
I like that uniform.


22
0:1:6,459 --> 0:1:16,52



23
0:1:16,52 --> 0:1:21,43
We are at the John Dory Oyster
Bar 29th and Broadway, and


24
0:1:21,43 --> 0:1:23,82
we're about to tuck in
to some cocktails.


25
0:1:23,82 --> 0:1:27,81
So this is Peter Cho, he's the
head chef at the Breslin.


26
0:1:27,81 --> 0:1:29,66
This is Scottie Boggs.


27
0:1:29,66 --> 0:1:31,97
Scott is a farmer.


28
0:1:31,97 --> 0:1:35,12
This is Christina, she's the
Sous Chef at the John Dory.


29
0:1:35,12 --> 0:1:37,26
So, we're just going to
have a few nibbles.


30
0:1:37,26 --> 0:1:39,5
We've got some oysters coming.


31
0:1:39,5 --> 0:1:43,647



32
0:1:43,647 --> 0:1:45,579
What have you got?


33
0:1:45,579 --> 0:1:48,477
Does that have alcohol in it?


34
0:1:48,477 --> 0:1:49,8
Wow, that's amazing.


35
0:1:49,8 --> 0:1:51,2
I'll have what she's having.


36
0:1:51,2 --> 0:1:52,41
I moved straight to London.


37
0:1:52,41 --> 0:1:55,12
I worked in a restaurant called
Kensington Place.


38
0:1:55,12 --> 0:1:57,51
I went to another called the
Brackenbury It was the


39
0:1:57,51 --> 0:2:0,23
forefront of the gastropub
movement, I suppose.


40
0:2:0,23 --> 0:2:2,25
The chef there was a very, very


41
0:2:2,25 --> 0:2:3,855
professional dedicated chef.


42
0:2:3,855 --> 0:2:5,485
He'd use every part
of the animal.


43
0:2:5,485 --> 0:2:6,84
He'd scrape the bones clean.


44
0:2:6,84 --> 0:2:11,43
Who doesn't love that, so you
learn not to waste stuff.


45
0:2:11,43 --> 0:2:14,38
Throughout my career, I've
just learned how to do


46
0:2:14,38 --> 0:2:15,98
different things in different
restaurants.


47
0:2:15,98 --> 0:2:17,616
Peter, have you tried
this yet?


48
0:2:17,616 --> 0:2:21,26
This is a mussel corn chowder
with some Andouille sausage


49
0:2:21,26 --> 0:2:22,586
from Calabria.


50
0:2:22,586 --> 0:2:24,62
It's made with Calabrese
chili peppers.


51
0:2:24,62 --> 0:2:27,43
It's super spicy and porky.


52
0:2:27,43 --> 0:2:32,66
It just goes so well with the
corn and the mussels.


53
0:2:32,66 --> 0:2:33,91
Cheers, guys.


54
0:2:33,91 --> 0:2:38,7



55
0:2:38,7 --> 0:2:41,705
We're going to go to Rucola,
Joe Pasqualetto.


56
0:2:41,705 --> 0:2:45,55
He actually has a fantastic
restaurant in Brooklyn, very


57
0:2:45,55 --> 0:2:46,84
rustic cuisine.


58
0:2:46,84 --> 0:2:49,71
Italian, of course, his last
name gives it away.


59
0:2:49,71 --> 0:3:0,12



60
0:3:0,12 --> 0:3:4,25
I run my kitchen, you know, I
like to think I run a tight


61
0:3:4,25 --> 0:3:6,35
ship, but we like to have
fun at the same time.


62
0:3:6,35 --> 0:3:8,3
We like to have a laugh
and a joke.


63
0:3:8,3 --> 0:3:11,12
But when it comes to the food,
it's all very serious.


64
0:3:11,12 --> 0:3:13,87
You have to treat the
food with respect.


65
0:3:13,87 --> 0:3:17,79
Hopefully, I lead by example,
and I touch it in a certain


66
0:3:17,79 --> 0:3:21,13
way, and I put it away in a
certain way, and I season it a


67
0:3:21,13 --> 0:3:22,96
certain way, and cook
it in a certain way.


68
0:3:22,96 --> 0:3:26,2
And hopefully, that translates
to a nice


69
0:3:26,2 --> 0:3:29,645
orderly and healthy kitchen.


70
0:3:29,645 --> 0:3:34,21
This is Jamie she's the GM,
wonderful GM at The Spotted


71
0:3:34,21 --> 0:3:37,205
Pig, and head chef,
Ralphie, at The


72
0:3:37,205 --> 0:3:38,4
Spotted Pig is here also.


73
0:3:38,4 --> 0:3:39,85
Who's running the restaurant?


74
0:3:39,85 --> 0:3:42,52
RALPH JOHNSON: Nobody.


75
0:3:42,52 --> 0:3:44,47
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: So after the
Brackenbury, I went to the


76
0:3:44,47 --> 0:3:45,26
River Cafe.


77
0:3:45,26 --> 0:3:46,73
I loved the River Cafe.


78
0:3:46,73 --> 0:3:49,29
I stayed four years there,
and became sous chef.


79
0:3:49,29 --> 0:3:54,16
I wrote menus, did ordering, and
tried to teach and learn,


80
0:3:54,16 --> 0:3:57,4
and it was definitely something
that made me more


81
0:3:57,4 --> 0:4:0,89
secure in my decision
about being a cook.


82
0:4:0,89 --> 0:4:3,59
And then I got offered a job
to come to New York.


83
0:4:3,59 --> 0:4:4,84
The rest is history.


84
0:4:4,84 --> 0:4:8,8



85
0:4:8,8 --> 0:4:9,97
KEN FRIEDMAN: I was looking
for a chef, and I kind of


86
0:4:9,97 --> 0:4:11,66
asked around.


87
0:4:11,66 --> 0:4:14,52
And I wasn't really sure
what I wanted.


88
0:4:14,52 --> 0:4:17,39
But I wanted somebody
interesting, not just a local


89
0:4:17,39 --> 0:4:19,899
chef that kicked around from
restaurant to restaurant.


90
0:4:19,899 --> 0:4:21,18
Jamie Oliver came to town.


91
0:4:21,18 --> 0:4:24,46
I tried to see if I could
get him to be the chef.


92
0:4:24,46 --> 0:4:26,32
He said, no, you can't afford
me, there's no way.


93
0:4:26,32 --> 0:4:30,41
I'm a big star in England. "Are
you thick?" I think is


94
0:4:30,41 --> 0:4:31,79
what he said.


95
0:4:31,79 --> 0:4:33,18
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: "Are
you a twat?"


96
0:4:33,18 --> 0:4:35,17
KEN FRIEDMAN: Yeah, I think
it was more like-- yeah.


97
0:4:35,17 --> 0:4:39,165
He said there's a woman
who works at The


98
0:4:39,165 --> 0:4:41,7
River Cafe in London.


99
0:4:41,7 --> 0:4:42,69
He said, you might be
able to get her.


100
0:4:42,69 --> 0:4:45,635
She's like the next-- or she'll
be the next head chef


101
0:4:45,635 --> 0:4:47,42
there eventually if she stays.


102
0:4:47,42 --> 0:4:49,512
I already knew that I wanted
her even before I met her.


103
0:4:49,512 --> 0:4:59,58



104
0:4:59,58 --> 0:5:2,77
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: I think what
we have is very special.


105
0:5:2,77 --> 0:5:4,11
It think it works.


106
0:5:4,11 --> 0:5:6,92
Ken is so good at
what he does.


107
0:5:6,92 --> 0:5:9,84
KEN FRIEDMAN: What do I do?


108
0:5:9,84 --> 0:5:13,67
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: You move
pictures and water plants.


109
0:5:13,67 --> 0:5:16,25
We kind of just let each
other do their own


110
0:5:16,25 --> 0:5:17,59
thing, and it works.


111
0:5:17,59 --> 0:5:19,12
We trust each other.


112
0:5:19,12 --> 0:5:24,345
And we talk if we have a
problem, which is very rare.


113
0:5:24,345 --> 0:5:24,733
JAMIE AND RALPH: [SING-SONG]


114
0:5:24,733 --> 0:5:25,806
Chef--


115
0:5:25,806 --> 0:5:27,56
chef!


116
0:5:27,56 --> 0:5:33,6



117
0:5:33,6 --> 0:5:34,18
APRIL BLOOMFIELD:
It's amazing.


118
0:5:34,18 --> 0:5:37,48
It tastes like curry.


119
0:5:37,48 --> 0:5:38,87
RALPH JOHNSON: Quite truthfully,
before here, I


120
0:5:38,87 --> 0:5:42,33
never worked anywhere for more
than a year and a half.


121
0:5:42,33 --> 0:5:44,48
And it's been a wonderful
experience being in New York


122
0:5:44,48 --> 0:5:47,939
and working for April and
finding my path as a cook.


123
0:5:47,939 --> 0:5:51,851



124
0:5:51,851 --> 0:5:53,318
MALE SPEAKER 1: Tomato
potato salad.


125
0:5:53,318 --> 0:5:54,568
APRIL BLOOMFIELD:
Tomato potato.


126
0:5:54,568 --> 0:6:3,98



127
0:6:3,98 --> 0:6:4,8
Hey, babe.


128
0:6:4,8 --> 0:6:5,446
JOE PASQUALETTO: How are you?


129
0:6:5,446 --> 0:6:5,942
Thank you.


130
0:6:5,942 --> 0:6:9,414
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: It's
so delicious.


131
0:6:9,414 --> 0:6:10,902
Bravo, bravo!


132
0:6:10,902 --> 0:6:16,854
[CHEERING]


133
0:6:16,854 --> 0:6:31,29



134
0:6:31,29 --> 0:6:31,59
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: OK.


135
0:6:31,59 --> 0:6:34,65
No screaming like
girls, please.


136
0:6:34,65 --> 0:6:37,99
Anyway, so we're going to go
ahead back to Manhattan, and


137
0:6:37,99 --> 0:6:39,24
we're going to go
to The Breslin.


138
0:6:39,24 --> 0:6:44,79



139
0:6:44,79 --> 0:6:47,28
So we're going to go over to
the Breslin right now, and


140
0:6:47,28 --> 0:6:49,7
we're going to make some chicken
liver on toast, yum.


141
0:6:49,7 --> 0:6:56,5



142
0:6:56,5 --> 0:6:57,67
So the Breslin is
a bit different.


143
0:6:57,67 --> 0:7:2,49
It's a bit more kind of sharp
corners, a bit more glassy,


144
0:7:2,49 --> 0:7:6,81
kind of moody, in a good way.


145
0:7:6,81 --> 0:7:8,64
And the food is a
lot more hearty.


146
0:7:8,64 --> 0:7:11,952
It's definitely a place you want
to hang out in the winter


147
0:7:11,952 --> 0:7:17,3
it's snowing outside, and you
want a nice glass of whiskey,


148
0:7:17,3 --> 0:7:18,6
and a big pig's trotter
or something.


149
0:7:18,6 --> 0:7:25,34
So I have some chicken livers,
and I have some caramelized


150
0:7:25,34 --> 0:7:28,46
onions, little bit of
olive oil, some


151
0:7:28,46 --> 0:7:30,62
salt, and some chili.


152
0:7:30,62 --> 0:7:35,12
And then I have some parsley
with their stalks on, freshly


153
0:7:35,12 --> 0:7:39,125
sliced lemon and some
port and Madeira.


154
0:7:39,125 --> 0:7:42,5



155
0:7:42,5 --> 0:7:44,11
I like to be present.


156
0:7:44,11 --> 0:7:45,3
I like to be in my kitchens.


157
0:7:45,3 --> 0:7:46,84
I like to create.


158
0:7:46,84 --> 0:7:48,7
I like to teach.


159
0:7:48,7 --> 0:7:52,44
All those flavors I mingle
up-- sweet, salty.


160
0:7:52,44 --> 0:7:55,91
The three restaurants that I
have right now, the Pig, the


161
0:7:55,91 --> 0:7:58,225
Breslin, and the John Dory,
they have their own


162
0:7:58,225 --> 0:7:59,41
personality, which I like.


163
0:7:59,41 --> 0:8:3,72
And I think it's important to
have personalities, not just a


164
0:8:3,72 --> 0:8:4,54
cookie cutter.


165
0:8:4,54 --> 0:8:7,61
It keeps me inspired, and it
keeps my chefs inspired.


166
0:8:7,61 --> 0:8:9,81
It gives them something
else to move onto.


167
0:8:9,81 --> 0:8:11,74
Helps keep people, stay
in the family.


168
0:8:11,74 --> 0:8:13,67
Like my chefs, if they feel
like they want to have a


169
0:8:13,67 --> 0:8:16,17
different experience, we can
just move them to the John


170
0:8:16,17 --> 0:8:16,8
Dory or the Pig.


171
0:8:16,8 --> 0:8:18,69
I think it benefits everybody.


172
0:8:18,69 --> 0:8:21,36
It's important to express
your vision.


173
0:8:21,36 --> 0:8:23,34
That's what they're there for.


174
0:8:23,34 --> 0:8:26,26
You have a lot of responsibility
to your staff


175
0:8:26,26 --> 0:8:28,45
to help them grow as cooks.


176
0:8:28,45 --> 0:8:30,53
So yeah, it's important
to be there.


177
0:8:30,53 --> 0:8:32,919
If you're not there, then what's
the point of them being


178
0:8:32,919 --> 0:8:34,159
there kind of thing.


179
0:8:34,159 --> 0:8:37,48
Yeah, I like to work
in general.


180
0:8:37,48 --> 0:8:39,185
I come from a working
class family.


181
0:8:39,185 --> 0:8:42,4
I'm very proud of that.


182
0:8:42,4 --> 0:8:45,39
At the end of the day, I feel
tired, because I've been


183
0:8:45,39 --> 0:8:48,93
working hard, and my feet
are hurting, in a


184
0:8:48,93 --> 0:8:51,43
sadistic kind of way.


185
0:8:51,43 --> 0:8:52,4
But I do.


186
0:8:52,4 --> 0:8:57,215
I'd rather work hard than not
work hard, and be lazy.


187
0:8:57,215 --> 0:9:7,49



188
0:9:7,49 --> 0:9:8,15
MALE SPEAKER 2: Chicken
liver toast?


189
0:9:8,15 --> 0:9:9,9
MALE SPEAKER 3: Oh, wonderful.


190
0:9:9,9 --> 0:9:10,34
Thank you.


191
0:9:10,34 --> 0:9:23,73



192
0:9:23,73 --> 0:9:24,98
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh!


193
0:9:24,98 --> 0:9:27,66



194
0:9:27,66 --> 0:9:29,95
APRIL BLOOMFIELD: Hey guys,
we have a bit of pickles.


195
0:9:29,95 --> 0:11:29,95
