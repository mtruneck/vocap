###11 [PEOPLE SHOUTING]
###13 JACOB SOBOROFF: The world's biggest party
###15 is going on right now.
###17 Carnaval kicked off last Friday.
###18 Millions of people converge in the streets
###20 of Brazil's major cities for five days of nonstop dancing,
###24 partying, and parades before Lent.
###25 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###30 JACOB SOBOROFF: If you want to be a part of the action,
###32 you're in luck.
###33 YouTube Carnaval is live streaming four hours
###35 of events and concerts from Salvador every single night.
###37 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###41 [FANS SHOUTING]
###42 JACOB SOBOROFF: Guys, tune in right now,
###44 because it all ends on Wednesday.
###45 We got a playlist for you after the show,
###47 with even more Carnaval fun from all across the country.
###49 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###50 EARNEST, SR.: In honor of Carnaval,
###51 I give you this Brazilian masterpiece, quite possibly
###53 the largest stop-motion film ever made-- in square miles.
###56 Using everything from street signs to garbage cans,
###59 several graffiti artists painted works of art
###61 all over Sao Paulo, then pieced them together for this film.
###64 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###71 EARNEST, SR.: 21st century art set to 1950s music
###74 is a beauty unto itself.
###75 Head over to Rodrigo's channel so you
###76 can see this and the other great videos he's made.
###79 JACOB SOBOROFF: A young pelican swims ashore after a storm
###81 and is taught to fly by a human.
###83 Separated from his family, the people who
###85 found him literally ran up and down the beach flapping
###87 their arms to show this little guy what to do,
###89 and then this happened.
###90 [MUSIC PLAYING, SOUND OF  PELICAN'S WINGS FLAPPING]
###92 
###97 JACOB SOBOROFF: This video was just released.
###99 It is so majestic, so beautiful, we had to share it.
###103 CARLY: I'm a huge fan of Laci Green because she answers
###106 all of the questions that the rest of us weenies
###108 are too afraid to ask.
###109 In her newest episode, she enlists the help
###110 of a friend to discuss what sex is
###112 like for people with disabilities.
###113 OLIVIA: There is actually a fetish
###115 for people who have disabilities.
###117 It's called devotees.
###118 Or if you want to be more specific for people
###120 who use wheelchairs, it's called a chair chaser.
###123 But at the same time, if you remove the person
###127 from the disability and if you just note the disability,
###131 what is the relationship about?
###132 CARLY: Laci's been an incredibly positive force in the community
###135 since 2008, and she currently has the top sex ed channel.
###138 Her work is definitely something that
###139 is very near and dear to my heart.
###141 If you're not familiar with it, head over to her channel
###143 and check it out.
###143 You've got a lot of catching up to do.
###146 JACOB SOBOROFF: Cub reporter Steve Goldbloom is desperately
###148 trying to get the story, and I do mean desperately.
###150 The latest episode of this mockumentary series
###152 follows Steve as he investigates the online dating scene.
###155 STEVE GOLDBLOOM: I understand we're
###156 going to set up a profile for me.
###157 RACHEL SELIGER: We are going to set up your profile.
###159 [CAMERA SHUTTER NOISE]
###159 STEVE GOLDBLOOM: Yep, that's an odd one.
###161 RACHEL SELIGER: How tall are you, really?
###162 STEVE GOLDBLOOM: I would say 6'2".
###163 RACHEL SELIGER: Be honest.
###164 STEVE GOLDBLOOM: 5'11".
###165 Nice to meet you.
###166 LEAH: Oh.
###168 STEVE GOLDBLOOM: You look lovely.
###169 LEAH: I don't like oysters.
###170 STEVE GOLDBLOOM: Oysters are great. [COUGHING]
###172 Thank you.
###173 LEAH: Thanks.
###173 STEVE GOLDBLOOM: It was fun.
###175 LEAH: Oh, what a nightmare.
###176 STEVE GOLDBLOOM: Ah, you still have our mic.
###177 JACOB SOBOROFF: The series is centered around the technology
###178 start-up scene, and last episode he focused on ride-sharing apps
###181 like Lyft and Uber.
###181 And somehow he managed to steal a Tesla along the way.
###184 STEVE GOLDBLOOM: If wanted to try driving--
###186 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, you could totally do it.
###187 You should try.
###187 STEVE GOLDBLOOM: I'm an excellent driver.
###188 [CAR HORN BLARING]
###189 STEVE GOLDBLOOM: Sorry.
###190 FEMALE SPEAKER: Steve?
###191 STEVE GOLDBLOOM: Yeah.
###192 [PASSENGERS SINGING]
###194 [SHOUTING]
###195 STEVE GOLDBLOOM: God!
###196 I see him.
###196 I saw him.
###197 JACOB SOBOROFF: They're posting new ones every week.
###198 Make sure to subscribe to keep up
###199 with Stevie G's in-depth investigations.

###202 BENJAMIN CRUTCHER: Hey, Youtube Nation,
###204 are you guys looking for a video of a woman tap dancing
###207 while playing the saxophone inside of a bubble?
###209 Well, Dreamy Sax is the video for you.
###212 [SAXOPHONE DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]
###213 
###222 JACOB SOBOROFF: Thanks, Ben.
###223 Believe it or not, that's actually
###224 an ad for an event planning company in India.
###227 We need you guys right here on the show.
###228 Film yourself talking about a video
###230 you love and then post it with the hashtag #YOUTUBENATION.
###232 Finally, we just want to take a moment
###233 to celebrate an animator that we love
###235 who just reached half a million subs.
###237 Play us out, Domics.
