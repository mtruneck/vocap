0:5:21,8 --> 0:5:22,834
>> KID: Don't give him, give me.


221
0:5:22,834 --> 0:5:24,8
>> I'm not giving either of you


222
0:5:24,8 --> 0:5:25,433
a high-five!


223
0:5:25,433 --> 0:5:26,9
>> BOTH: Aww!


224
0:5:26,9 --> 0:5:27,967
>> KID: Hey, you know what?


225
0:5:27,967 --> 0:5:28,967
I have a robot -- I mean,


226
0:5:28,967 --> 0:5:30,767
We have a robot that we've been


227
0:5:30,767 --> 0:5:32,1
working on, Sid and I.


228
0:5:32,1 --> 0:5:34,233
We call it the "VIC 2000."


229
0:5:34,233 --> 0:5:34,9
>> SID: Oh, yeah.


230
0:5:34,9 --> 0:5:35,967
>> It's a prototype that we've


231
0:5:35,967 --> 0:5:37,1
been working on for years and we


232
0:5:37,1 --> 0:5:38,6
thought maybe we could bring him


233
0:5:38,6 --> 0:5:39,467
out and show you.


234
0:5:39,467 --> 0:5:40,4
What do you think?


235
0:5:40,4 --> 0:5:41,3
>> Anh, it's okay.


236
0:5:41,3 --> 0:5:42,533
>> You like robots, right?


237
0:5:42,533 --> 0:5:43,867
>> Anh, yeah.


238
0:5:43,867 --> 0:5:46,567
They're like Transformers, so...


239
0:5:46,567 --> 0:5:46,967
yeah.


240
0:5:46,967 --> 0:5:48,266
>> You're going to love the


241
0:5:48,266 --> 0:5:49,533
VIC 2000, so I'll tell you


242
0:5:49,533 --> 0:5:50,367
what we'll do --


243
0:5:50,367 --> 0:5:52,7
We will take a short break and,


244
0:5:52,7 --> 0:5:54,667
when we get back, we will bring


245
0:5:54,667 --> 0:5:56,567
out the VIC 2000 and we'll let


246
0:5:56,567 --> 0:5:57,967
Luke take him for a spin.


247
0:5:57,967 --> 0:5:59,834
All righty? All righty.


248
0:5:59,834 --> 0:6:0,5
We'll be right back.


249
0:6:0,5 --> 0:6:1,333
You're going to love this.


250
0:6:1,333 --> 0:6:2,633
You're going to love


251
0:6:2,633 --> 0:6:3,567
the VIC 2000.


252
0:6:3,567 --> 0:6:7,233
>> Today's word is "courtesy"!


253
0:6:7,233 --> 0:6:14,533
>> Courtesy counts!


254
0:6:14,533 --> 0:6:22,266
>> Courtesy!


255
0:6:22,266 --> 0:6:32,367
Courtesy.


256
0:6:32,367 --> 0:6:42,266
Courtesy.


257
0:6:42,266 --> 0:6:48,2
Courtesy.


258
0:6:48,2 --> 0:6:50,767
Courtesy.


259
0:6:50,767 --> 0:6:53,266
>> Courtesy counts!


260
0:6:53,266 --> 0:7:0,333
Courtesy counts!


261
0:7:0,333 --> 0:7:1,7
>> Okay, we are back to


262
0:7:1,7 --> 0:7:3,4
"Kid Conversation" and, as we


263
0:7:3,4 --> 0:7:4,867
promised, we are going to


264
0:7:4,867 --> 0:7:6,6
introduce to you the VIC 2000.


265
0:7:6,6 --> 0:7:8,9
Right here, I have the remote,


266
0:7:8,9 --> 0:7:11,2
so I'm going to show everybody


267
0:7:11,2 --> 0:7:12,734
the VIC 2000. VIC!


268
0:7:12,734 --> 0:7:13,7
Let me get this to work.


269
0:7:13,7 --> 0:7:14,133
Forward.


270
0:7:14,133 --> 0:7:15,767
>> SID: Don't forget to press


271
0:7:15,767 --> 0:7:17,1
the button over there.


272
0:7:17,1 --> 0:7:18,133
>> Come forward.


273
0:7:18,133 --> 0:7:18,834
Walking forward.


274
0:7:18,834 --> 0:7:19,767
>> SID: Here it comes.


275
0:7:19,767 --> 0:7:20,7
>> KID: Is it working?


276
0:7:20,7 --> 0:7:21,3
Is he coming?


277
0:7:21,3 --> 0:7:22,166
>> SID: He should be coming.


278
0:7:22,166 --> 0:7:23,7
>> VIC! VIC! Agh.


279
0:7:23,7 --> 0:7:24,467
>> I just changed his


280
0:7:24,467 --> 0:7:25,333
batteries this morning.


281
0:7:25,333 --> 0:7:25,8
>> You did?


282
0:7:25,8 --> 0:7:26,834
>> Oh, there it is!


283
0:7:26,834 --> 0:7:28,533
>> Okay, good good good good


284
0:7:28,533 --> 0:7:29,3
good good.


285
0:7:29,3 --> 0:7:30,133
All right,


286
0:7:30,133 --> 0:7:31,734
let me get him to turn.


287
0:7:31,734 --> 0:7:33,9
All right, turn.


288
0:7:33,9 --> 0:7:34,433
Oh, no, other way.


289
0:7:34,433 --> 0:7:35,0
Turn the other way.


290
0:7:35,0 --> 0:7:35,8
>> Yeah, you got to hit the


291
0:7:35,8 --> 0:7:36,667
other direction. There you go.


292
0:7:36,667 --> 0:7:38,533
>> Okay, okay, okay, okay.


293
0:7:38,533 --> 0:7:39,967
All right, all right.


294
0:7:39,967 --> 0:7:42,667
This is -- This is -- Watch.


295
0:7:42,667 --> 0:7:43,8
Press this one here, move,


296
0:7:43,8 --> 0:7:45,266
and then he raises his arm.


297
0:7:45,266 --> 0:7:46,667
Arms up!


298
0:7:46,667 --> 0:7:47,5
>> There it is.


299
0:7:47,5 --> 0:7:49,33
>> Which button? Which button?


300
0:7:49,33 --> 0:7:50,266
>> This one right here.


301
0:7:50,266 --> 0:7:51,567
>> Oh.


302
0:7:51,567 --> 0:7:52,9
>> This one will make him turn,


303
0:7:52,9 --> 0:7:54,0
if you spin both of these


304
0:7:54,0 --> 0:7:54,8
at the same time.


305
0:7:54,8 --> 0:7:56,667
Watch him turn around.


306
0:7:56,667 --> 0:7:59,66
Turning around in a circle.


307
0:7:59,66 --> 0:7:59,934
>> Here it is.


308
0:7:59,934 --> 0:8:1,4
>> There we go. All right.


309
0:8:1,4 --> 0:8:4,467
Very good. All right, beautiful.


310
0:8:4,467 --> 0:8:5,734
>> Put his arms down. I like it


311
0:8:5,734 --> 0:8:6,7
when his arms are down.


312
0:8:6,7 --> 0:8:7,6
>> Okay, putting his arms down.


313
0:8:7,6 --> 0:8:9,33
>> [ Alarm pulses ]


314
0:8:9,33 --> 0:8:10,433
>> SID: Oh, no no no, you didn't


315
0:8:10,433 --> 0:8:11,734
want him to put his head down.


316
0:8:11,734 --> 0:8:13,166
>> Oh, wait a minute.


317
0:8:13,166 --> 0:8:13,967
>> LUKE: I think you put


318
0:8:13,967 --> 0:8:14,433
his butt up.


319
0:8:14,433 --> 0:8:15,8
>> KID: All right, turn a


320
0:8:15,8 --> 0:8:17,2
little bit to your right.


321
0:8:17,2 --> 0:8:19,367
We got -- Turn --


322
0:8:19,367 --> 0:8:20,6
Okay, good good good.


323
0:8:20,6 --> 0:8:21,333
All right.


324
0:8:21,333 --> 0:8:22,3
>> SID: Looking good.


325
0:8:22,3 --> 0:8:23,667
>> Oh, here, you want to try it?


326
0:8:23,667 --> 0:8:24,734
>> LUKE: Yay!


327
0:8:24,734 --> 0:8:25,8
>> KID: What are you going to


328
0:8:25,8 --> 0:8:26,7
do? Tell me what you're


329
0:8:26,7 --> 0:8:27,467
going to try to do.


330
0:8:27,467 --> 0:8:28,7
Are you going to try to make him


331
0:8:28,7 --> 0:8:29,667
lift his arms, or what?


332
0:8:29,667 --> 0:8:30,3
>> LUKE: Uh --


333
0:8:30,3 --> 0:8:31,0
>> KID: Arms up!


334
0:8:31,0 --> 0:8:32,5
>> LUKE: Arms!


335
0:8:32,5 --> 0:8:33,8
>> KID: Oh, wait a minute.


336
0:8:33,8 --> 0:8:35,1
>> SID: Be careful, there.


337
0:8:35,1 --> 0:8:36,333
Don't press those buttons


338
0:8:36,333 --> 0:8:36,934
too fast.


339
0:8:36,934 --> 0:8:38,1
Nice and easy.


340
0:8:38,1 --> 0:8:39,7
>> Easy does it. Easy does it.


341
0:8:39,7 --> 0:8:40,867
Easy does it! Easy does it!


342
0:8:40,867 --> 0:8:41,934
>> There you go. Better.


343
0:8:41,934 --> 0:8:43,567
>> We've been trying to train


344
0:8:43,567 --> 0:8:45,266
VIC 2000 to help us around the


345
0:8:45,266 --> 0:8:46,667
house with vacuuming and


346
0:8:46,667 --> 0:8:47,533
cooking and cleaning.


347
0:8:47,533 --> 0:8:48,433
He's kind of like a


348
0:8:48,433 --> 0:8:49,233
personal butler.


349
0:8:49,233 --> 0:8:50,967
>> LUKE: Arms up!


350
0:8:50,967 --> 0:8:52,166
>> KID: Okay, can I see the


351
0:8:52,166 --> 0:8:52,867
remote again?


352
0:8:52,867 --> 0:8:53,867
Let me see the remote.


353
0:8:53,867 --> 0:8:54,6
You know what?


354
0:8:54,6 --> 0:8:55,867
>> LUKE: It doesn't really --


355
0:8:55,867 --> 0:8:57,7
What is he doing, dancing?!


356
0:8:57,7 --> 0:8:58,433
>> KID: I don't know.


357
0:8:58,433 --> 0:8:59,433
>> SID: You must've hit one of


358
0:8:59,433 --> 0:9:0,367
those dance buttons along


359
0:9:0,367 --> 0:9:0,834
the bottom.


360
0:9:0,834 --> 0:9:2,0
>> Let's see if we can get him


361
0:9:2,0 --> 0:9:3,0
to do something here.


362
0:9:3,0 --> 0:9:6,533
Luke, go hand VIC 2000 that box


363
0:9:6,533 --> 0:9:9,667
of cereal there, would you?


364
0:9:9,667 --> 0:9:11,1
Hand the VIC 2000 the box


365
0:9:11,1 --> 0:9:12,3
of cereal.


366
0:9:12,3 --> 0:9:13,467
>> And the bowl?


367
0:9:13,467 --> 0:9:14,367
>> Just, yeah,


368
0:9:14,367 --> 0:9:15,467
put it in his hand.


369
0:9:15,467 --> 0:9:16,867
Not the bowl, just the cereal.


370
0:9:16,867 --> 0:9:17,867
>> Oh.


371
0:9:17,867 --> 0:9:18,834
>> There you go, yeah.


372
0:9:18,834 --> 0:9:21,467
>> [ Beeping musically ]


373
0:9:21,467 --> 0:9:22,4
>> Try to put it right


374
0:9:22,4 --> 0:9:22,967
in his hand.


375
0:9:22,967 --> 0:9:24,233
>> Kid, you got to make sure you


376
0:9:24,233 --> 0:9:25,4
got your hand on there right.


377
0:9:25,4 --> 0:9:26,2
>> LUKE: Oh!


378
0:9:26,2 --> 0:9:27,767
I think he lost a piece.


379
0:9:27,767 --> 0:9:29,767
>> Get the bowl. Get the bowl.


380
0:9:29,767 --> 0:9:31,633
And hold the bowl out so he can


381
0:9:31,633 --> 0:9:33,433
pour the cereal into the bowl.


382
0:9:33,433 --> 0:9:34,333
>> We've been working on this.


383
0:9:34,333 --> 0:9:35,1
This is going to be good.


384
0:9:35,1 --> 0:9:36,0
>> All right, let me get this.


385
0:9:36,0 --> 0:9:36,633
The remote's kind of


386
0:9:36,633 --> 0:9:37,133
acting strange.


387
0:9:37,133 --> 0:9:38,33
>> SID: Hold still.


388
0:9:38,33 --> 0:9:39,4
>> Try to get the cereal


389
0:9:39,4 --> 0:9:40,2
in the bowl.


390
0:9:40,2 --> 0:9:41,5
>> Don't move the bowl.


391
0:9:41,5 --> 0:9:42,4
Keep it still.


392
0:9:42,4 --> 0:9:44,467
>> All right, hold on. Ugh!


393
0:9:44,467 --> 0:9:45,367
The remote's acting


394
0:9:45,367 --> 0:9:46,66
kind of funny.


395
0:9:46,66 --> 0:9:48,33
Try to pour the cereal


396
0:9:48,33 --> 0:9:48,967
into the bowl.


397
0:9:48,967 --> 0:9:50,533
Help him out, there, Luke.


398
0:9:50,533 --> 0:9:51,767
>> [ Luke laughing ]


399
0:9:51,767 --> 0:9:53,0
>> KID: Ah! Ah!


400
0:9:53,0 --> 0:9:54,33
>> SID: What's going on?!


401
0:9:54,33 --> 0:9:55,266
>> KID: The VIC 2000's lost it!


402
0:9:55,266 --> 0:9:56,367
Something's wrong with


403
0:9:56,367 --> 0:9:57,66
this remote!


404
0:9:57,66 --> 0:9:58,7
>> SID: Holy moly. Careful.


405
0:9:58,7 --> 0:10:0,166
>> Can we shut him down?


406
0:10:0,166 --> 0:10:1,266
>> Shut him down!


407
0:10:1,266 --> 0:10:2,467
He's shutting down.


408
0:10:2,467 --> 0:10:3,934
>> Luke! What happened?!


409
0:10:3,934 --> 0:10:5,5
>> I didn't do anything!


410
0:10:5,5 --> 0:10:6,633
>> It's like somebody has


411
0:10:6,633 --> 0:10:7,934
another remote, or something!


412
0:10:7,934 --> 0:10:9,734
I totally lost control of


413
0:10:9,734 --> 0:10:10,834
the VIC 2000!


414
0:10:10,834 --> 0:10:11,967
>> SID: I don't know what's


415
0:10:11,967 --> 0:10:12,467
going on.


416
0:10:12,467 --> 0:10:13,4
Don't look at me.


417
0:10:13,4 --> 0:10:14,233
>> [ Luke giggles ]


418
0:10:14,233 --> 0:10:15,9
>> KID: Ugh.


419
0:10:15,9 --> 0:10:17,66
>> Well, at least it's all done.


420
0:10:17,66 --> 0:10:18,0
At least he's not moving


421
0:10:18,0 --> 0:10:18,7
anymore, or doing


422
0:10:18,7 --> 0:10:19,333
anything crazy.


423
0:10:19,333 --> 0:10:21,367
>> He seems to be frozen.


424
0:10:21,367 --> 0:10:24,367
>> I think he lost a piece.


425
0:10:24,367 --> 0:10:25,266
>> KID: He's falling apart.


426
0:10:25,266 --> 0:10:26,667
I'll tell you, what, Luke --


427
0:10:26,667 --> 0:10:28,166
have a seat, would you, please?


428
0:10:28,166 --> 0:10:29,433
Sit back down for a second.


429
0:10:29,433 --> 0:10:30,6
>> Do that again!


430
0:10:30,6 --> 0:10:32,166
>> I'll tell you what --


431
0:10:32,166 --> 0:10:33,6
You said you're good at drawing


432
0:10:33,6 --> 0:10:34,6
Transformers, right?


433
0:10:34,6 --> 0:10:35,133
