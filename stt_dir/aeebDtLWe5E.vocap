###1 Today we've got the world's most dangerous dance, the secret
###4 behind sriracha, and Cliff diving off the red carpet.
###7 [ELECTRONIC MUSIC]
###14 If you're walking the red carpet this Sunday,
###16 I've got a good idea for you.
###17 Great dress, fantastic shoes, and a parachute.
###20 Roberta Mancino is an Italian model
###22 and a professional daredevil.
###23 She set up her red carpet event on the cliffs of Italy's Monte
###26 Brento.

###37 We've got a playlist of other insane base jumpers
###39 for you after the show.
###40 Come si dice complete crazy people?
###44 CARLY: A little over year ago, British journalist Ben Cook
###46 set out to conquer the world of YouTube
###48 even though he had never uploaded a video before.
###50 And in the process he created my favorite web series
###52 of all time.
###53 It's an in-depth look at the world
###54 of online video from someone who started as a complete outsider.
###57 And the finale I've been waiting super long for is finally here.
###60 BEN COOK: The great thing about online video
###62 is that there is infinite space for people to create in,
###66 and so there will always be people
###67 who are doing it in new and interesting ways.
###69 CARLY: There's also a bunch of cheeky humor in there,
###72 like my main man Tom Scott playing God.
###74 TOM SCOTT: Who's going to hell?
###74 OK, let's see.
###75 Anyone who thinks Gangnam Style is still a thing.
###77 It isn't.
###78 Charlie the Unicorn, of course, and the Vlogbrothers.
###81 MALE SPEAKER: The Vlogbrothers are going to hell?
###82 TOM SCOTT: I'm just messing with you.
###83 Only Hank.
###84 CARLY: I say grab your cats and giant glass of iced tea
###86 and enjoy the entire series on Ben's channel.
###89 JACOB: What's James Murphy been up
###90 to since he left LCD Sound System?
###92 Our friends at "The Wall Street Journal" tracked him down.
###94 ARABY WILLIAMS: I made a video about James Murphy
###95 and his "Hope for the Sounds of the New York City Subway"
###98 with my colleague Hannah Karp.
###99 I hope you like it.
###100 JAMES MURPHY: I started noticing that the subway sounds
###102 quite brutal.
###103 Why don't we just make it a nice sound?
###105 Just make it pleasant.
###106 The more people going through, the more times
###108 the turnstile gets turned, if you have different notes that
###110 are all in agreement, it would make music.
###112 
###115 It's just an opportunity to have something beautiful in a place
###118 where something beautiful seems impossible.
###120 JACOB: This video's been getting shared a ton by New Yorkers
###122 and music fans everywhere.
###123 Let's get this thing pushed through.
###124 Go sign James Murphy's petition at subwaysymphony.org.

###128 SHANNON COFFEY: Hey, YouTube Nation, Shannon here
###131 from Random Ass Girly Channel.
###132 I want to share the official video for the song "Killing,"
###134 by We Are Shining and Eliza Doolittle, because it's insane.
###138 Have you ever seen someone just dancing in a music video?
###141 Yeah.
###142 But have you seen someone dancing
###143 while they get knives thrown at them?
###146 [POP MUSIC]
###148 
###156 SHANNON COFFEY: There's dancing and knives put together.
###159 What else could you want from a music video?
###161 And the song is really good, too.
###163 
###167 JACOB: The sriracha apocalypse is upon us.
###169 Residents of Irwindale, California,
###171 are claiming that the odors from a sriracha factory
###173 are burning their eyes and their lungs,
###175 and they're pushing to shut it down.
###176 If you're a little behind in your sriracha chemistry,
###178 you're in luck.
###178 The American Chemical Society dissects
###180 what makes this hot sauce hot and what makes it so good.
###183 NARRATOR: These two molecules trigger the TrpV1 receptor
###186 protein in our mouths, thus causing
###188 the spicy hot sensation.
###189 Then the body responds to capsaicin's burn
###191 by releasing a pain-killing endorphin rush kind of like one
###194 a jogger feels after a long run.
###195 JACOB: The public hearing is today
###196 and the fate of the world's greatest hot sauce
###198 hangs in the balance.
###199 Get informed.
###200 Share this video with a sriracha lover in your life.
###203 
###206 A lot of people argue over what pop-up storybook, animated,
###209 love songs, zombie ukulele music video is the best one,
###211 and finally there's an answer to that question.
###213 DEANNE SMITH: I wrote a song called "Apocalypse," kind
###215 of about love, and I got my buddy Beck Hill to animate it
###219 because I think she has a really unique style.
###221 You're going to see what I mean.
###224 [SINGING "APOCALYPSE"]
###227 
###239 JACOB: If you've made or found a video that you
###241 want to see right here on the show,
###242 film yourself talking about it just like DeAnne did
###244 and post it with the hashtag YouTubenation.
###246 Now plays us out, Fidlar.
