###16 PATRICK BROWN: My photographs are different from me.
###18 The photograph's a record of what's been
###20 happening in front of me.
###22 It's not something I've constructed.
###25 If I'm able to give a voice for that situation, then I've
###28 achieved my objective.
###29 And that's really important to me as an individual, but also
###33 as a photographer.
###34 
###61 I love Bangkok for exactly the same reasons I hate it.
###64 I love it for its noise.
###65 I love it for its intensity, sweatiness.
###67 And there's always some treasure troves in Bangkok.
###70 And for all those reasons, it just drives me bonkers
###73 sometimes, and I have to leave.
###75 But every place in the world must drive people crazy and
###78 happy at the same time.
###81 My name is Patrick Brown.
###82 I'm a photographer.
###83 I've been based in Thailand for the last 12 years.
###86 And this is home for me for the while.
###91 [SPEAKING THAI]
###92 
###106 PATRICK BROWN: I've traveled all my live,
###107 since I was about five.
###109 Originally from England, from Sheffield.
###111 Grew up in the Middle East.
###112 I spent some time in South Africa.
###113 And I spent some time in Canada.
###116 And finally, the family settled in
###118 Australia when I was 13.
###121 I'm still doing what I did when I was a young boy.
###123 I'm still travelling, still meeting interesting people.
###127 I think photography for me was the best visa I've never had
###132 in my life.
###133 I've been with racing car drivers
###135 I've been with homeless.
###137 I've been with drug addicts.
###139 I've been with politicians.
###140 I've been with royalty.
###141 It's one of the best vehicles to move in and out of
###143 societies that normally you wouldn't be able to navigate
###146 your way through.
###148 That's my car that I rebuilt when I was 18, modeled on an
###151 old English car.
###153 Took me about three months to rebuild it, maybe even a bit
###155 longer, actually.
###157 I'm trained as a tool-maker, which is somebody that makes
###160 machines and stuff.
###161 I really enjoy working with my hands.
###166 And I like the craft of photography, not just taking
###170 the photograph or the equipment, but actually I like
###173 to produce a photograph.
###174 I like to go in the darkroom.
###175 I find the darkroom very therapeutic, just dodging
###178 between the light and making a photograph
###180 darker or lighter here.
###181 And it's hand-printed.
###183 You can never make another print exactly the same.
###185 And I find that really adorable.
###189 I was incredibly naive about what documentary
###192 photography could do.
###194 I was working in a multi-story carpark.
###195 And I saw a little snippet about this guy
###198 in the local rag.
###199 And he was in Africa, where he was the only surgeon for 2 and
###202 1/2 million people.
###203 So I sold my car and my surfboard and went over there
###208 and documented him.
###209 And I was there for six weeks.
###211 Six weeks was all I could get off for work.
###213 And I came back to Australia, had an exhibition.
###216 It raised a lot of money for--
###217 his name is Robert Weeden.
###219 We made awareness for him in Australia.
###221 And then it was published in Australia.
###222 And it won a couple of awards.
###224 It was one of the pivotal points when I realized you
###227 could actually make a difference with a photograph.
###229 
###234 And it wasn't until about '96, '98 that I made a decision I
###239 could actually make money from this.
###240 And then started to do more and more work with magazines
###243 in Australia.
###245 
###248 This is all animal trade, by the way, full of animal stuff.
###252 
###254 As you can see, everything's under alphabetical order.
###259 Only I know where to find it.
###263 A colleague convinced me, just get out of
###265 Australia and come to Asia.
###266 Have a look around.
###267 If you don't like it, you can move on.
###269 And then I ended up in Chiang Mai and met
###272 some Burmese refugees.
###275 They gave me access to places I would never be able to get
###278 to, and opened up a whole world to me that I really
###283 didn't know existed to the extent that it did, and that
###286 was the Burmese border.
###288 This is on the Thai-Burma border near [INAUDIBLE].
###294 And then you've got actually real tiger
###295 teeth, and tiger claws.
###298 And these are different tiger teeth.
###301 And they have different value where they come from.
###304 These are used as potency, or protective elements regarding
###307 the person that wears them.
###308 They have amulets on them, or into key chains
###311 and things like that.
###313 "Trading to Extinction," I started working on it in 2002.
###316 This is my first solo book.
###318 And I had no idea what the animal trade was about.
###321 For me, the animal trade was little trinkets selling in
###324 shops at that stage.
###326 And most of the world, I think in some way, thought the same.
###330 Four years ago, the statistic was $52 billion annually.
###335 That's what the animal trade is worth, which rivals some of
###338 the biggest electronic industries.
###340 One of my favorite statistics from this whole project is
###343 that there's more Bengali tigers in Texas than there is
###348 in the Bay of Bengal.
###351 It's a huge industry.
###353 And I would be still working on this until
###354 probably the day I die.
###356 So there had to be some physicality
###357 of boundaries placed.
###359 Southeast Asia was the spot.
###361 And plus, I live here.
###362 It made it quite logical.
###366 This is patrolling in southern Cambodian in a
###369 place called Bokor.
###371 That was really quite an amazing trip, that one.
###375 The first story I did was anti-poaching team in Bokor.
###381 And this anti-poaching team, we'd go in on a night
###384 insurgence.
###385 And we would hunt down or trace down the poaching team.
###390 And most of the guys in the actual anti-poaching team are
###392 actually ex-poachers, because there's nothing better than a
###395 poacher to catch a poacher.
###396 He knows his routine and he knows his habits.
###400 They're about to plan to do a night insurgence, which I have
###403 to say is one of the scariest things to do, because you're
###405 in total darkness.
###406 And you can only just see the person in front of you.
###409 And the way your eyes work, the center of your retina is
###414 actually damaged from the amount of sun it's had.
###417 So you have to look out of the corner of your eye.
###420 That's the most sensitive part of your eye.
###422 That was a pretty intense trip, that one.
###426 This is a poacher that's been caught.
###428 And that's his name, his age, and the crime, and where it
###431 was, and the date, obviously.
###433 And they did it to all the poachers that they captured.
###439 I have quite a lot of empathy for the poachers.
###441 A majority of the poachers are just doing what their
###444 ancestors have done, which is hunt.
###446 The Cambodian poachers that I went with, I think they got
###450 $10 or $15 for each monkey--
###452 very, very little money.
###454 They have very, very little knowledge of where that
###456 product's going to go.
###457 
###466 This is pretty much all I'll be taking.
###471 So take my four cameras, my Polaroid, the Rolleiflex and
###475 my two Nikons, and three lenses, and my film bag.
###480 
###489 Welcome to Guangzhou from Bangkok.
###492 Guangzhou is close to the Hong Kong border.
###494 It's southwest China.
###496 And it's the economic powerhouse for this region.
###500 It's very close to Tianjin, which is the manufacturing
###503 powerhouse of China.
###505 Due to the wealth of the manufacturing of Tianjin and
###508 the money that's come in to this area, this has always
###511 been a fruitful place for animal trafficking.
###515 What I'm hoping to achieve is to see where we are five years
###518 down the track.
###520 It's a 10-year project.
###521 So where was I halfway through this project I was
###524 here the last time.
###525 
###535 It's good to come back and relive it and
###537 see where we are.
###537 And what I'm hoping to find is that things
###539 maybe have moved on.
###541 I don't think the trade is in any way dwingled.
###543 I think they've just got smarter about hiding it.
###546 They're not as confident as the used to be.
###549 They know these things do get out into the
###551 world outside China.
###553 So they're a bit more paranoid about people with cameras.
###557 -[SPEAKING CHINESE]
###558 
###569 PATRICK BROWN: I never ask permission.
###570 I just get in there.
###572 And I know I've got a very short window of opportunity to
###575 get the pictures.
###576 As soon as you start to ask for permission, people are not
###580 going to be themselves.
###581 And a few times, I push it, and I push it.
###583 If somebody's stopping me from taking pictures, or tries to
###586 stop me from taking pictures, I push it even further,
###589 because there's a reason why this person is
###591 trying to stop me.
###592 Because he knows they're doing something wrong.
###595 So the hardest thing in a photograph is
###598 capturing an emotion.
###600 So if I'm able to capture this angry person trying to stop me
###604 from taking pictures, it also adds another little dimension
###607 to the body of work.
###610 We go into one pet shop which specializes in selling fish.
###614 One fish in this particular shop, I think,
###616 was worth about $10,000.
###619 The people-- the owner of the shop openly talks about how he
###621 smuggled the fish in from Australia, and smuggled them
###624 in from the Philippines.
###626 -[SPEAKING CHINESE]
###627 
###634 -This is from the US.
###636 PATRICK BROWN: US?
###637 So that's an American fish in China.
###640 -Yeah.
###641 They can make sure that--
###643 -[SPEAKING CHINESE]
###646 -Yeah, they don't really have a legal channel to help you
###649 ship it back to Australia.
###651 He just confessed to me that a lot of fish are smuggled in.
###655 PATRICK BROWN: He did?
###656 -Yeah.
###657 PATRICK BROWN: These guys are untouchable.
###659 It's just not on the radar of the law enforcement offices.
###662 It's not important enough for them.
###664 
###667 Everything in the market isn't endangered, no.
###669 That's where that gray zone of the wildlife trade
###673 comfortably sits in.
###674 And I'll use the crocodile as an example.
###677 2 and 1/2 thousand tons of live animals go through
###681 Heathrow a day.
###682 You have a shipment of, say, 25, 30 crocodiles.
###685 So the custom guys at Heathrow, he's looking for
###688 contraband, he's looking for drugs.
###691 But he's not a reptile expert.
###692 So he counts 30 crocodiles, ticks that off, yeah, move on.
###698 In that 30, there could be 10 very, very endangered
###702 crocodiles.
###703 
###714 Guangzhou's also very famous for its wild game restaurants.
###719 But one of the most common things is you can go choose
###721 your alligator, choose your crocodile.
###724 And in this particular restaurant, it's just out
###725 there in the open.
###726 And it's got its snout bound.
###729 And guests, that's the first thing the see when they walk
###731 into the restaurant is a crocodile.
###734 I want that crocodile to be chopped up.
###736 And I want it for my dinner.
###737 That's all you have to say, and it will be done.
###739 
###744 With the animal trade, the consumption of animals, it's
###747 more to do with you are what you eat.
###750 So you consume a piece of the tiger, you'll inherit a part
###754 of that tiger.
###755 And you become more virile and stronger and you'll fight off
###758 a cold, or you'll beat the arthritis.
###762 Most of the animal is consumed in some form or manner, or
###765 used to develop a cream or a soup or a tea, or
###770 something like that.
###771 
###779 We went to Safari World, which is about 40 minutes outside
###783 the central Guangzhou.
###785 And it's just a huge
###787 entertainment complex for families.
###790 It revolves around animals.
###793 There is a circus.
###794 And there is a zoo.
###796 And I do agree with them.
###797 They're very educational.
###799 And you need those institutions.
###800 But realistically, an elephant in a zoo
###804 is actually a prisoner.
###807 They've got X amount of space.
###809 And they know that X amount of space like the
###811 back of their hand.
###813 Zoos make a lot of money.
###817 They're a great money earner.
###819 And the rarer the animal you have, or the rarer collection
###822 of animals you have, the more people are
###824 going to go see them.
###826 Some zoos are legitimate, and some zoos aren't.
###830 The majority of zoos and in this part of the world are not
###834 so legitimate.
###835 
###837 When we went to Safari World, they have flamingos in
###842 restaurants.
###842 So people can have a nice steak and watch a pink
###845 flamingo, which is obviously not native to Asia.
###848 Then in another restaurant, you have the White Tiger
###851 Restaurant, where you can sit down and have your meal and
###854 watch probably one of most endangered tigers in the world
###857 walk around while you have your meal.
###859 And supposedly in this particular institution, it has
###863 50% of the world's population of white tigers.
###868 That's something wrong there.
###870 
###881 I'm not an animal activist.
###882 It's more about exposing those subcultures in society.
###887 The animal is not really the story.
###890 What's happening to the animals is the story.
###893 And that cause is actually the subcultures of smugglers and
###896 poachers and customers.
###898 That's what I'm interested in.
###901 My career as a photographer in the last 10 years has been
###905 focused around the animal trade.
###908 Every little penny I've earned has gone
###910 back into this project.
###912 And one of the biggest discussions that I had with
###914 publishers was that it was in black and white.
###917 If I had shot this in color, I think it
###919 would have no problems.
###920 It would have been printed straight away.
###921 But for some reason, because it's in black and white, it
###924 scares people away, financially.
###926 The reason I shot it in black and white was a
###931 really simple reason.
###933 I really understand black and white film.
###936 I dream in black and white.
###937 I don't dream in color.
###939 So on a subconscious level, I think black and white is more
###942 of a powerful tool to let people delve more into their
###947 subconsciousness to actually get a bit more
###949 of a sense of placement.
###952 They let their imagination go a little bit further than they
###954 would do if they were looking at a color photograph.
###957 For me, it really tells a story in a much
###959 more clearer sense.
###961 
###966 We visited the Guangzhou Medicine Market, which is a
###970 very famous institution.
###972 It's pretty wacky.
###973 You see a lot of crazy things there, from seahorses, geckos
###977 drying on the street, turtles, a multitude of different
###981 creatures for sale, and parts of different creatures.
###985 What drives the industry is naivety and greed.
###989 Naivety in the sense of lack of education regarding what
###992 the health benefits from some of these products do.
###995 Rhino horn is one of the classics.
###1001 If you consume a rhino horn, mythology believes that you'll
###1004 be able to mate for two or three hours.
###1008 It doesn't work.
###1008 But it's very porous.
###1010 So one of the tricks of the trade is to soak the rhino
###1013 horn actually in the Viagra.
###1015 So that drives the trade as well.
###1016 It's all this naivety.
###1018 And it works, because it's soaked in Viagra.
###1020 A bag of [INAUDIBLE].
###1022 
###1027 A few hundred years ago, people would be
###1029 invited to a wedding.
###1031 And just the immediate family would have shark fin soup.
###1034 And guests would stand around in awe that they were able to
###1037 eat shark fin soup.
###1038 It was a very sought after delicacy.
###1040 Now the wedding parties have grown to 300 or 400 people.
###1044 And they all have shark fin soup.
###1046 When you look at the shark fins, you see the bags and
###1049 hundreds of bags of this stuff.
###1051 And three fins basically means one shark.
###1055 It's just a staggering amount of sharks that have died for
###1060 something that's basically cartilage and
###1063 doesn't taste of anything.
###1065 While we were in the medicine market in Guangzhou, this guy
###1069 in a blue track suit comes up to me while taking pictures.
###1073 And he's trying to sell me some bear bile products.
###1076 He was a little bit uncomfortable with the Chinese
###1079 watching him, and watching the deal go down.
###1082 So we get him aside, and we go talk about it.
###1085 -[SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1086 
###1106 PATRICK BROWN: He said he bought it off some guy who was
###1110 either from Tibet or from Nepal.
###1112 And he got a customs official on the border to
###1116 get it in to China.
###1118 And he's going to Guangzhou, which traveling thousands of
###1121 kilometers to sell two items shows you how much of a hub
###1125 Guangzhou is.
###1127 After 9/11, there was a big push to find out who are the
###1133 people who are generating income for the terrorists and
###1137 the smuggling routes.
###1139 And it wasn't until Congress decided to put a lot of
###1142 funding into that, once it was researched, it pretty much
###1146 took everybody by surprise how big the animal trade was.
###1149 -[SPEAKING CHINESE]
###1151 PATRICK BROWN: What about just there?
###1151 -[INAUDIBLE].
###1153 
###1155 PATRICK BROWN: He wants to keep the camera out?
###1157 -Yeah.
###1158 It attracts a crowd.
###1159 PATRICK BROWN: It attracts a crowd.
###1160 I understand.
###1161 Well, he's doing something that's legal.
###1163 
###1166 We'll just stand in there.
###1167 And the camera will stay out here.
###1169 We'll just stand in there, so the camera doesn't come.
###1171 
###1176 10 years in the project, I've never had somebody literally
###1179 come up to me and want to do the deal there and then, and
###1182 totally blase about it all.
###1184 He saw me as an opportunity to try and make a quick dollar.
###1188 He wanted $1,000 basically for a very small
###1191 amount of bear bile.
###1193 OK, thank you.
###1195 
###1204 This is the last trip for the animal trade.
###1210 This is it.
###1213 I'm 43 years old.
###1215 I've been doing this for just under a quarter of my life.
###1218 
###1221 A few months from now, people will be holding a book in
###1223 their hands.
###1224 And it will no longer be my book.
###1226 It'll be their book.
###1227 
###1230 I always knew I would get to this stage.
###1234 But now I'm here.
###1235 Actually, it's just kind of weird that it doesn't actually
###1238 feel like it's really happening.
###1242 It's 10 years in the making.
###1243 And it's going to where I initially thought it
###1246 would always go.
###1247 It's quite a nice feeling, actually, I have to say.
###1252 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1282
