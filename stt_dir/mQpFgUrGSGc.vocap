###6 JAMES FREY: This is my attorney in Los Angeles.
###9 His name's David Krintzman.
###11 Hey, dude, what's up?
###12 DAVID KRINTZMAN: Hey, how are you?
###14 JAMES FREY: Dude, I have 10 process servers standing
###18 outside of my apartment building saying they're suing
###21 me for intellectual property theft and defamation to God
###27 and slander to Jesus.
###30 Should I call the cops?
###32 Should I call the Hell's Angels?
###33 What should I do?
###34 DAVID KRINTZMAN: Hang on just one second.
###35 JAMES FREY: Can they even sue me for that?
###37 Can you be sued for slandering God?
###40 DAVID KRINTZMAN: No--
###41 God is not a person.
###42 If somebody could try to file a lawsuit, it would get tossed
###45 out immediately.
###46 JAMES FREY: Hey, dude, you know what?
###50 I'm just fucking with you guys.
###51 I'm with "Vice" magazine and they had heard
###53 I make crank calls.
###54 So we decided to crank you.
###55 DAVID KRINTZMAN: [LAUGHING]
###57 JAMES FREY: [CHUCKLING]
###58 DAVID KRINTZMAN: Motherfucker.
###59 JAMES FREY: [CHUCKLING]
###60 DAVID KRINTZMAN: See, this is what I have to fucking deal
###62 with when I represent James Frey.
###64 ROCCO CASTORO: [LAUGHING]
###66 JAMES FREY: Later, dude.
###67 I'll call you later.
###69 DAVID KRINTZMAN: Bye.
###70 JAMES FREY: Bye.
###71 ROCCO CASTORO: So, hi, James.
###72 How are you?
###75 JAMES FREY: I'm good.
###75 How are you?
###76 ROCCO CASTORO: You're doing good today?
###77 JAMES FREY: I'm doing well today, man.
###79 ROCCO CASTORO: So, there's been a lot of press about your
###80 book over the last few days.
###82 And it's about a modern day Messiah who advocates orgies
###86 and drugs and lives for a short time in the subways
###90 underneath New York City.
###91 Now, do you think people are going to try to kill you or
###95 anything like that because of this book?
###97 JAMES FREY: Are people going to try to kill me?
###98 I hope not, man.
###99 I don't want to die, you know.
###103 I don't know what's going to happen.
###104 I mean, some people read the book and don't find it
###107 offensive at all.
###108 And some people read it and say, how long
###112 till you leave America?
###115 I mean, that's part of the fun of releasing a book is seeing
###119 what happens, see if people read it, see if people care,
###122 see how they react.
###125 The book wasn't designed to want to make people kill me.
###128 I tried to write a valid religious document, write a
###135 book about what I really think it might be like if the
###137 Messiah came back to Earth.
###139 People think about the real Christ and about the Bible.
###145 And one of the things that's forgotten, which is one of the
###147 most important things, is that when Christ was on Earth, he
###150 was a radical.
###151 He wasn't part of acceptable society.
###154 He didn't believe in anything that acceptable
###157 society held dear.
###159 He was a radical preacher with a radical message who was
###164 dangerous enough so that he was killed, so that he was
###169 strung up on a cross and killed.
###171 I think if the Messiah were to arrive or Christ to return, he
###174 would be that same type of radical.
###178 ROCCO CASTORO: You said it's your stab
###179 at a religious document.
###181 So what kind of research went into it?
###184 JAMES FREY: I had a number of consultants on the book.
###186 I had an orthodox rabbi here in New York who was a
###189 consultant.
###190 I had a Pentecostal preacher, a Catholic priest, a trauma
###193 surgeon, a criminal defense attorney, a
###197 mental health advocate.
###199 I wanted the book to be right.
###201 I know how I feel about God and how I feel about faith and
###205 how I feel about religion.
###206 But I didn't know the mechanics of it.
###209 There are very specific theories about Messiah.
###211 There are very specific requirements within Judaism to
###214 be considered Messiah.
###216 And I needed to know all that stuff.
###217 ROCCO CASTORO: The book is structured just like the New
###221 Testament, Old Testament.
###222 It's told through different books, through different
###224 narrators who interact with Ben Zion, who's the Messiah.
###228 And some of the books are actually named--
###230 Ruth or Esther.
###231 How much do they have in common with the original?
###234 JAMES FREY: Obviously, I looked a lot at the first two
###238 books of the Bible.
###239 
###241 I looked at how the stories were told.
###244 I looked at weird stuff like numbers.
###246 There's a lot of numbers in the Bible.
###248 And they're very specific.
###250 I looked at the Gospels of Christ.
###252 I love that we don't know the story of Christ from his own
###256 perspective.
###257 We just know it from people who knew him.
###260 And I love that the Gospels of Christ are, in and of
###264 themselves, unreliable.
###266 They don't actually match up perfectly.
###267 They tell different stories.
###269 I just tried to think what would a contemporary version
###272 of this be?
###273 So yeah, the book is written entirely from the perspective
###276 of the friends, family, and followers of Ben Zion Avrohom,
###282 also known as the Messiah, also known as the Lord God.
###286 Every chapter of the book is written in a radically
###289 different voice.
###290 The first chapter is a 18-year-old Puerto Rican girl
###294 living in a housing project in the Bronx.
###296 The second chapter is 45-year-old foreman at a
###300 construction site.
###301 The third chapter is a 38-year-old trauma surgeon at
###305 a hospital.
###306 And it was cool to have to literally reinvent how I wrote
###311 with every chapter.
###312 ROCCO CASTORO: When you were compiling research for the
###314 book, did you have any new thoughts about faith?
###317 JAMES FREY: Oh, I have a profound respect for faith.
###319 I mean, if anything, writing the book gave me more respect
###322 for religion and made me think about it more.
###325 But what the book really is is me trying to work out my own
###328 feelings about it.
###330 I've struggled with the idea of God and religion and faith
###334 almost my whole life.
###335 And it's something I've written about every time I've
###338 written a book.
###339 You know, most of "A Million Little Pieces" is about it.
###343 I walk around New York.
###344 And I see things that are incredibly beautiful every day
###348 and incredibly horrific every day.
###350 And you think about, well, why are we even here?
###353 How does my brain work?
###355 Is my brain different from my spirit or my soul?
###358 Do I believe, do I not?
###361 What do I believe in?
###362 How do I reconcile living in the 21st century, living in an
###367 era of nuclear weapons and genetic engineering and living
###371 in an era where we know being gay is not a decision somebody
###377 makes but the way someone's born?
###380 How do we reconcile these ideas--
###383 the physics of Stephen Hawking with, you know, stories of a
###389 man with a big white beard who sits on a chair with a bunch
###392 of dudes judging everybody?
###394 It's really hard for me to reconcile those ideas.
###396 But I think it must be a beautiful thing to believe in
###399 God without a shred of doubt and to have faith.
###403 ROCCO CASTORO: Were you brought up
###404 with any sort of religion?
###405 JAMES FREY: I was baptized Catholic.
###407 And I was confirmed Episcopal.
###409 And my parents took us to church every Sunday
###411 when I was a kid.
###412 I grew up in Cleveland.
###414 But I've never been able to really believe in
###419 that kind of God.
###421 And in a lot of ways, the book is me writing about a God I
###424 could believe in.
###426 If I were to believe in something, it would be
###429 someone like this.
###430 ROCCO CASTORO: I've had a lot of the same struggles.
###432 At the same time, when I find myself in really crappy
###435 situations, I might do something that
###438 could be called praying.
###439 Have you done that any time recently or in the last 10
###444 years or anything like that?
###445 JAMES FREY: Yeah, many times.
###448 I mean, whenever you go through a bad time in your
###451 life, you want some reassurance, or
###453 you want some help.
###454 And when your life's completely out of control, you
###457 want to try to find some way to control it or find some
###460 thing that can control it.
###462 
###464 I don't really talk about this.
###466 I've never really talked about it.
###468 But my wife and I had a son who died a couple years ago.
###472 I sat in the hospital.
###473 And I watched him die.
###476 And when that was happening, I would get on my knees every
###481 day and beg God for help, literally beg and plead and
###486 cry and say, help me.
###489 I would say, take me and let my son have a life.
###492 I don't need a life.
###493 Take my life, give it to him.
###495 And while that was happening, I went to churches of
###500 different denominations around New York.
###502 I went to a mosque.
###503 I went to a synagogue.
###504 I went to all these places.
###506 And everywhere I went, I got down on my knees.
###508 And I begged for help.
###510 I begged for something--
###512 for relief, for a sign, for whatever.
###516 And I didn't get anything.
###518 I didn't feel anything.
###519 I don't know if that's because I'm a bad guy in God's eyes.
###523 I don't know if that's because there isn't a God.
###526 I don't know if I did it the wrong way or if I needed to do
###531 it before that to be able to get the help then.
###533 I don't know.
###534 I don't have the answers to any of it.
###536 But I've never gotten a sign.
###540 ROCCO CASTORO: A large part of the book has to do with the
###543 world is ending in some way.
###546 And whether that means flat-out apocalypse, and
###549 everything blows up, or just a complete change of how humans
###554 live, that's what Ben Zion preaches in the book.
###557 And that's the word of God through him.
###560 Do you think we could be close to the end-- like, this could
###564 really be happening right now?
###566 JAMES FREY: I mean, I think we live in a world where a lot of
###569 people have a lot of bombs.
###571 There are bombs that take out tens of millions
###576 of people at a time.
###578 And there's a lot of hatred between all the people who
###580 have these weapons.
###581 And if you look at the conflicts around the world,
###583 most of them are religious conflicts--
###587 the Middle East, Israel, Palestine, the United States.
###591 And Islam as a global religion is, in large
###595 part, a religious conflict.
###597 9/11 was a strike in the name of religion.
###600 And if you look back over the course of history for the last
###605 couple thousand years, most of the big wars have sort of been
###608 land grabs done in the name of religion.
###611 
###613 And unless there's some other system that comes in to
###617 replace the ones we have--
###619 which I don't see happening--
###622 nothing's going to change.
###623 There'll be some sort of major conflict tied into religion
###631 that will kill a lot of people.
###634 ROCCO CASTORO: And let's talk about something else that's a
###637 big deal with this book--
###640 how you're publishing it.
###641 So why don't you tell us exactly what your plans are
###644 for releasing this to the world.
###645 JAMES FREY: I tried to write a radical book that wasn't like
###648 anything anybody had done before.
###650 And I'm trying to release it in a radical way.
###654 I've had problems in my career before when I write
###656 controversial material, problems dealing with sort of
###659 corporate entities behind it and how they disavow it or
###664 step away from it once the controversy
###667 reaches a certain point.
###668 So I decided I wasn't even going to
###669 contemplate doing that.
###672 So I thought an art gallery would be a more appropriate
###676 place to publish books.
###677 I got in touch with five of my artist friends--
###680 Richard Prince, Ed Ruscha, Terry Richardson, Dan Colen,
###683 and Richard Phillips.
###685 And I'm collaborating with them on making these
###687 illuminated manuscripts, like old medieval Bibles, where
###691 they sort of make art that is their reaction to
###695 what they've read.
###697 And then we publish it as sort of a book with a
###699 lot of art in it.
###700 And they're going to be beautiful, astounding,
###703 one-of-a-kind objects.
###705 And I think the future of publishing is that.
###710 We're seeing publishing change very radically right now.
###715 We have the internet.
###716 We have digital devices like the Kindle and the
###719 Nook and the iPad.
###722 And I don't need a publisher to release my
###724 books on those things.
###725 So I sort of arrived that I was going to publish these
###727 beautiful books and limit the number of them and then, at
###731 the same time, let anybody who wants to read the book read it
###735 on a digital device.
###736 I wanted to become a writer to break rules and to get in
###739 trouble and to do things that pushed boundaries.
###747 And I think at some point, literature has become this
###749 precious thing that doesn't value that anymore, even
###752 though most of the historical figures in it only did that.
###760 Something's a book.
###762 And everything else is irrelevant.
###765 What's relevant is when somebody picks up that book
###768 and reads it, how it makes them feel or if it makes them
###772 think or, if at the end of it, they think it
###776 was worth their time.
###777 All the other stuff is just bullshit.
###779
