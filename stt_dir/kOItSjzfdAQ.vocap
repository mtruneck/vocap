###27 
###28 Well thanks very much.  Today is a really
###30 an exciting opportunity.  Indeed,
###32 that was very energizing, the last session.
###34 We hope to carry that forward and add a little of,
###36 a little bit of clarity, to the vector
###38 that we're on.  I truly think that this is
###40 a unique moment in history.  We are retiring the
###42 space shuttle. We've, uh,
###44 been transitioning the international space
###46 station from one of assembly, to operations
###48 and utilization.  And using that as a
###50 cornerstone of our human space
###52 flight operations and activities to go
###54 beyond low Earth orbit for,
###56 uh, for the duration.
###58 And so, um,
###60 I think it was a fitting introduction
###62 about rising
###64 to the occasion.  And, so what I'd like to do
###66 is, I've got a great couple of
###68 folks on the panel.
###70 I encourage you to take a look at the bios
###72 if you're interested, on page 43
###74 of your, uh, of your
###76 notebook.
###78 Garry Lyles, 35 plus years in the
###80 in the business,
###82 doing everything from systems
###84 integration through program management,
###86 to, uh, leading
###88 most recently, our analysis
###90 of alternatives.  Leading the
###92 study teams looking at our
###94 critical next decisions, looking at
###96 in an objective, thorough
###98 and absolutely complete way.
###100 Uh, our future
###102 heavy lift launch vehicle,
###104 and the space launch systems
###106 options that we're looking at.
###108 He is truly a quintessential
###110 engineer and uh,
###112 and just an asset to the agency.
###114 And, uh, following his,
###116 uh, following his talk
###118 uh, we'll have Maria.
###120 Maria Collura, she is the Deputy Director
###124 of the Space Transportation Planning Office.
###126 Engaged in
###128 our critically important
###130 activities associated with
###132 commercial crew, uh,
###134 to both the international space station
###136 and low Earth orbit.  She has just,
###138 uh, come off
###140 the, uh, the highly
###142 energized and much-anticipated
###144 CCDev-2 announcement.
###146 And so, I think she'll give you some great
###148 insight into that.  Collectively,
###150 these things will help
###152 outline and add some clarity
###154 to the path that we're on.  But, this
###156 is a path that's not yet fully written.
###158 It's one that we are indeed looking to
###160 you, and to share with you
###162 the current status.  So, much
###164 like we wove
###166 a little bit of storytelling
###168 into the past.  I'm going to tell you a
###170 little bit of the why.  Same thing from an
###172 integrative perspective.  I'm going to tell you some of the how
###174 and then it's about participation.
###176 So, we'll do the
###178 engage part last.
###180 Um, I'll start off.
###182 I'm going to give you a little bit of perspective,
###184 kind of a scene setter, here.
###186 And then, I'll dive into my specific pitch.
###188 It's going to be on the human exploration
###190 architecture team.
###192 Some of the near-term work that we've been doing,
###194 and, uh, and the results of that.
###196 As well as the, uh, as well as
###198 the steps ahead.  So, essentially
###200 this just gives you a little snapshot of the vision.
###202 Talk about the budget context
###204 and the capability-driven exploration,
###206 talk about what that means.
###208 Talk about this human exploration framework team, give you
###210 a little bit of insight into
###212 uh, the game plan, our concept
###214 of operations.  Also, talk about
###216 affordability which is a fundamental driver,
###218 much like safety
###220 and, uh, performance
###222 and mission execution.  Talk about
###224 the HAT, which is the follow on work
###226 and I'll wrap it all up.
###228 So, you know, it was an interesting
###230 comment on the organization chart. [ Audience Laughter ]
###232 Well, you, know why I put this one in here,
###234 is, we have about 32 plus direct reports
###236 to the administrator, right.
###238 And, essentially the point I'm trying to make with this
###240 is we have a huge
###242 amount of people engaged.
###244 Every facet across the spectrum:
###246 from people, resources to
###248 to infrastructure, to budget,
###250 to dealing with Congress and the White House,
###252 to the performance, to the missions
###254 to the design people, the safety of the mission assurance,
###256 the engineering and everybody in between.
###258 And it's a ten center effort.
###260 This is what NASA is about.
###262 This is, what is
###264 uh, this is the group or the
###266 body that we have to engage.
###268 Plus, you bring in Congress, and
###270 Congress is not a monolithic body.
###272 We've got the 111th, which passed
###274 the Authorization Act of 2010
###276 in bi-partisan fashion,
###278 signed by the president.  But now,
###280 we have the 112th, and that's a whole
###282 new ballgame.  And, if you, you know, just watch
###284 the political theater playing out.  You've got
###286 the White House, you've got the OMB--
###288 the Office of Management and Budget,
###290 the OSTP.  All the different players,
###292 plus the industry stakeholders,
###294 international, other governmental agencies,
###296 and, uh, and academia.
###298 Add that all to the mix and you
###300 wonder why it's a little bit challenging
###302 to get some decisions.  Everybody has a voice.
###304 And, boy, for ten people in a room
###306 you'll probably get 11 or 12
###308 different opinions, because as people go around
###310 they actually change their story a little bit.
###312 So, that's kind of the soup, or
###314 kind of some of the dynamics that we're playing with.
###316 Um,
###318 and we've got a clear vision, you know,
###320 from our newest release of the
###322 2011 strategic plan.
###324 NASA's strategic goals are
###326 those six listed there.
###328 And, I highlighted in blue the first one:
###330 Extending and sustaining human activities
###332 activities across the solar system.
###334 That's a real big driver for our exploration activities.
###336 But, so too is blending in
###338 a tight synergy with the science side.
###340 You know, developing the technologies
###342 and the capabilities that are necessary
###344 to not only enable and
###346 expand these capabilities, but also
###348 to add huge value to
###350 back here, terrestrially
###352 on the planet Earth.
###354 And, uh, to our national and international economic future
###356 as well as benefiting
###358 all of humanity.  Tying in
###360 our programmatic and institutional
###362 capabilities is ever
###364 more important, given the scarcity
###366 and constrained resources that we have.
###368 And, finally, it's about sharing this.
###370 Uh, not only engaging people
###372 in a two-way fashion,
###374 but sharing this awesome,
###376 and this is the best sense of the word,
###378 message and future that we do have together.
###380 So, essentially the budget overview
###382 for exploration systems.
###384 So, we've got a little under $4 billion.
###386 So, if you can't do something with $4 billion,
###388 something is wrong, right?
###390 We've got a heck of a lot, a heck of a lot of
###392 opportunity here. We do have, uh,
###394 and you know, everybody, uh everybody
###396 is concerned about,
###398 about the, uh, about the, dollars, but this is
###400 really $240 million
###402 above what we, uh, what our FY11
###404 authorized level was.
###406 It does fund
###408 a really diverse portfolio across
###410 uh, across
###412 a broad portfolio
###414 of capabilities.
###416 ISS is at the corner piece of that, for human space flight ops.
###418 And, uh, and
###420 it's also designed
###422 specifically to maintain US
###424 leadership and to engage
###426 in beyond low Earth orbit,
###428 or beyond LEO capabilities
###430 and development for the future.
###432 It also has a
###434 strong underpinning in developing
###436 and leveraging the
###438 commercial space industry.
###440 And that's for safe and affordable access
###442 to the international space station,
###444 and also helping to enable
###446 the broader activities beyond.
###448 That also includes the
###450 Space Launch System and the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle
###452 for, uh,
###454 our destinations and
###456 multiple destinations beyond low Earth orbit,
###458 as well as, uh, as well as
###460 the other activities.
###462 So, that's a little snapshot. This is the quick overview,
###464 Essentially, this
###466 budget enables us to work, uh,
###468 certainly.  We already talked about ISS
###470 being highly leveraged, both
###472 in a utilization sense for exploration benefit.
###474 We are looking
###476 to identify those quick
###478 those, uh, those quick
###480 wins as well as the longer-term
###482 set of technology
###484 and research capabilities that will allow
###486 us to conquer challenges in environmental
###488 control and life support systems.
###490 Irradiation.  Extended duration of radiation.
###492 Extended duration micro-gravity experience
###494 or countermeasures.
###496 And, so those are some of the critical
###498 drivers as well as
###500 propulsion and habitation
###502 and dealing with the, uh,
###504 dealing with the delay and disruption tolerant communications capabilities that we'll be
###510 needing for extended beyond low Earth orbit exploration.
###514 Likewise, it will
###516 allow us to aggressively pursue those human
###518 research and life support
###520 and habitation things that we talked about
###522 for technology capability
###524 development perspective.
###526 And, very consistent with the
###528 national space policy, this
###530 is all about huge partnerships
###532 with not only inter-agency folks,
###534 but internationals,
###536 academia and industry.
###538 And by industry, we're talking new space,
###540 old space, we're talking
###542 non-traditional space, we're partnering with
###544 people like Google and Caterpillar,
###546 John Deere, and
###548 GM and Ford, and
###550 Apple and
###552 people across the community that
###554 you don't always consider traditional aerospace players.
###558 So,
###560 little bit of a snapshot as to what
###562 and why.  I think all too often
###564 we throw out, hey, multi-destinations.
###566 We've got high Earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit,
###568 Lagrange points.  Why?
###570 What's compelling about them?  Well, essentially,
###572 we've got a lot of opportunities for
###574 assembly or repair.  They're an excellent
###576 location for, uh,
###578 space, or, uh, telescopes
###580 large, uh, larger
###582 uh, large aperture telescopes.
###584 Looking at Mars and its moons,
###586 essentially, perhaps a horizon
###588 destination for humans
###590 at least in the relatively near term.
###592 You know, is there a life beyond Earth?
###594 You know, how did it evolve?
###596 And, I think from there, uh,
###598 it holds a special place
###600 in many peoples, uh, many peoples
###602 psyche.  Likewise, the moon,
###604 uh, our nearest
###606 uh, our nearest, celestial
###608 body there, we can see a lot
###610 that is covered up by the, uh,
###612 by the environmental impacts here
###614 on the Earth.  It's a great historical
###616 record, uh, with the
###618 rich discoveries of water,
###620 and uh, and all the near-term
###622 other exciting discoveries that we've
###624 just begun to unravel with the Moon.
###626 Um, we OK?
###628 OK, uh, I think,
###630 that, uh, I think given the fact that
###632 it's just three days away as well
###634 holds huge potential
###636 commercial, uh, promise.
###638 And, uh, as we look at Near Earth Asteroids,
###640 NEAs, um,
###642 we have some compelling science
###644 questions.  Everything from
###646 how did the solar system form?
###648 To, uh, helping to
###650 gain some insight into planetary defense.
###652 We know that, uh,
###654 uh, throughout
###656 history, uh, Earth has
###658 uh, the planet Earth has seen some, uh,
###660 seen some impacts
###662 so, as we seek to better understand
###664 what we can do to, uh
###666 both potentially mitigate that or
###668 understand the dynamic, I think all of
###670 that is relevant.  So, that kind of
###672 gives you a little snapshot there.  This is kind of
###674 a picture of how it all weaves together.
###676 Here we are at the international space station down at the bottom,
###678 looking at our new, uh, our new
###680 low Earth orbit missions and as we
###682 extend out in kind of a crescendo of
###684 capabilities.  This is really what a
###686 capability driven, uh, framework or
###688 capability driven exploration
###690 is about.  It's about building the
###692 capabilities and the technologies such
###694 that you can go beyond in an iterative,
###696 or, stepwise fashion, and you
###698 don't have a single path.
###700 So, we have, uh, we can leverage
###702 uh, the, uh,
###704 GEO/HEO Missions, looking at lunar flybys,
###706 lunar surface, uh,
###708 "Min," and "Full Capability" Near-Earth Asteroids,
###710 Phobos/Deimos, and Mars.
###712 And, you see along the way,
###714 what, uh, what each, uh,
###716 what each new plateau affords.
###718 As, uh, keeping
###720 consistent with kind of the quick overview,
###722 I wanted to provide you some insight into,
###724 we call these "budget themes."
###726 When we go up and brief Congress,
###728 uh, with the President's budget, we
###730 talk in each of these theme areas.
###732 And, so that's why it's going to perfectly dovetail with
###734 uh, what Garry and Maria
###736 are gonna talk about.
###738 Essentially, we've got, uh, this theme
###740 The Human Exploration Capabilities budgeted
###742 $2.8 billion for FY12.
###744 Essentially, uh, that
###746 does include labor, and uh, essentially,
###748 that includes $1.8 billion
###750 for the Space Launch System
###752 and, uh, roughly a billion dollars for
###754 the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, and
###756 the ground ops, uh, kind of
###758 an amalgam between ground ops and
###760 21st Century, that enables that.
###762 So, that gives you a little snapshot there.
###764 Uh, right now, as we
###766 uh, and Garry,
###768 I won't spend hardly any time on this
###770 uh, because he will do an awesome job
###772 at it, and I mean awesome,
###774 cause he is incredibly thorough.
###776 Um, as we look at a Reference Vehicle
###778 Design that we communicated
###780 in our early, our early chats,
###782 it was 100
###784 metric ton, or pardon me a
###786 70 to 100 metric ton evolvable to
###788 130 metric ton launch
###790 vehicle.  Built and derived from
###792 the Ares and Shuttle hardware,
###794 with the capability to lift the
###796 Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle.  So, you see
###798 essentially, what the Reference
###800 Vehicle Design was,
###802 as we submitted.
###804 But, we've got, uh, we've had, uh
###806 a huge amount of work that's gone on since then.
###808 Next slide, uh, is
###810 looking at the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle.
###812 Again, we're looking
###814 beyond low Earth orbit,
###816 a variant of the Orion, essentially the
###818 block 2, for those of you that were familiar with it.
###820 And, essentially, this is looking at a
###822 requirements-based, or requirements-driven approach.
###824 Uh, and we're making some final decisions
###826 uh, this summer, we're going to
###828 be communicating that to Congress in what we
###830 call the 90-day report.
###832 And, uh, we'll be building that into the budget,
###834 budget activities and
###836 also the programmatic implementation.
###838 On the commercial side, and
###840 this is a beautiful, this is a beautiful kind of
###842 image showing, uh
###844 a whole bunch, or a
###846 a whole host of potential applications
###848 but, we've got about
###850 $850 million
###852 slated in FY12,
###854 and that includes the labor.
###856 Providing not only,
###858 looking for safer and reliable transportation
###860 to the, uh, and affordable
###862 commercial systems for both
###864 cargo first, and then crew to
###866 the international space station
###868 and low Earth orbit.  We are
###870 transitioning, um
###872 from, we're completing
###874 some of our milestones or our
###876 capability milestones based out
###878 to, uh, to uh, starting to
###880 generate, uh, to generate
###882 a broader industry capable
###884 of supporting the, uh, the crew
###886 uh, the crew needs and
###888 the transportation, traffic flow
###890 challenges of the international
###892 space station.  So, Maria
###894 will do yeoman's work
###896 in outlining that. Uh, as we look at
###898 exploration, research and development
###900 theme, essentially
###902 we've got, uh, we've got
###904 just under $300 million going to this.
###906 It includes the Human Research Program, as well
###908 as our Advanced Exploration Systems.
###910 And, those are, uh, those
###912 are some of our what we call "skunk works,"
###914 or lean or rapid prototyping,
###916 some non-traditional
###918 uh, if you will type approaches
###920 at NASA.  We've done several
###922 prototypes along this line
###924 things like the Robonaut 2,
###926 uh, the hab and habex
###928 and, uh, what used to be called
###930 the Lunar Electric Rover, now the
###932 Space Exploration Vehicle, the SEV.
###934 Those are all examples of prototype
###936 uh, approaches that we've done
###938 each one is a little bit different, but all carrying that
###940 principle, we've got about
###942 63, well not not about,
###944 we have 63 submittals in
###946 as part of this year's, uh,
###948 effort, and those are all getting
###950 reviewed as we speak right now.
###952 Um,
###954 as we look at, uh, with
###956 the Office of the Chief Technologist, OCT,
###958 Dr. Bobby Braun, we are
###960 sending what used to be the majority
###962 of our exploration technology development
###964 program.  We're sending that over to
###966 the Office of the Chief Technologist to
###968 to, uh, to do that work as part of a broader
###970 agency portfolio that will
###972 still remain critically important
###974 as those are mission enabling
###976 and mission critical for
###978 our exploration missions.
###980 Uh, and, for
###982 '12, we're taking a little breather
###984 on, uh, on the uh
###986 Exploration Precursor Robotics
###988 activities, but then in '13
###990 we have a, uh
###992 a blended funding line between exploration
###994 and Science Mission Directorate
###996 for, uh, for those in the
###998 sum of $30 million.
###1000 Um,
###1002 This just gives you a little bit more,
###1004 we already talked about
###1006 a risk-based approach to the international
###1008 space station, leveraging
###1010 what we can there, but also
###1012 the ultimate goal is to have much
###1014 longer, outside the
###1016 Van Allen radiation belt capabilities,
###1018 so that we can do these extended
###1020 mission durations of perhaps
###1022 a year or more.  So, that's a critical driver
###1024 and, uh,
###1026 the people part of it are
###1028 truly a daunting challenge,
###1030 but also a huge opportunity.
###1032 Uh,
###1034 looking a little bit at how we're shaping
###1036 that up, ISS utilization.
###1038 Developing space biomedical capabilities,
###1040 looking at, we talked about radiation
###1042 safety for the crew, and then
###1044 uh, very much akin with, uh,
###1046 with, uh the national
###1048 engagement,
###1050 harnessing the collective brain power
###1052 of not only our national research community,
###1054 but a very robust and
###1056 integrated international space research
###1058 community.  One that is
###1060 leveraging not only traditional partners,
###1062 but, personally, we, uh,
###1064 we've done a lot more with
###1066 Korea and other countries like that.
###1068 Smaller, burgeoning, uh,
###1070 blossoming, uh
###1072 space agencies. So, we're
###1074 looking to leverage and enhance those kind of
###1076 uh, partnerships.
###1078 And, uh, looking a little bit at
###1080 Advanced Exploration Program review, we already
###1082 talked some of that
###1084 this is the Robonaut 2, depicted in
###1086 the middle there.  Essentially,
###1088 we're looking to engage our
###1090 great, our great
###1092 and experienced workforce, and do more hands on
###1094 work here.  Uh, smaller
###1096 procurement dollar,
###1098 more intense civil servant
###1100 leveraged approach.
###1102 Um, we are looking
###1104 to ensure that we reduce
###1106 risk, lower our life cycle costs,
###1108 and validate some of the unique con ops.
###1110 So this is where we're allowed to take a little bit more risk.
###1112 We're allowed to
###1114 have some smart failures, as long as
###1116 we're learning from these, and, uh,
###1118 I think this is a strong step in the right direction.
###1120 And, changing the
###1122 paradigm, making us more agile and
###1124 more responsive, but most importantly
###1126 dealing with the critical need that we're going to have
###1128 from these systems in this, uh, in this
###1130 increasingly, uh,
###1132 challenging, uh, budgetary environment.
###1134 This is a doable solution.
###1138 Alright, we already talked a little bit about
###1140 that, I won't spend too much more on that.
###1142 We are using analogs in a
###1144 large way.  We're using ground tests,
###1146 flight tests, uh, we're using
###1148 final DTOs aboard the space
###1150 uh, space shuttle and also the
###1152 space station.  So,
###1154 that's kind of the scene setter,
###1156 What I'd like to give you now is a quick
###1158 snapshot into
###1160 our human exploration framework team,
###1162 talk about some of the context there.
###1164 So essentially,
###1166 I think
###1168 over the past couple of days, you've seen
###1170 just how profound and complex
###1172 and challenging and how
###1174 team oriented
###1176 uh,
###1178 truly bold, human
###1180 space flight systems
###1182 developments and operations are.
###1184 They transcend political cycles,
###1186 they transcend generations,
###1188 and yet,
###1190 we've had 24 teams since '69 who have
###1192 studied and done blue ribbon studies.
###1194 And yet,
###1196 when we kicked off this, our
###1198 charter had
###1200 six words that were different from the
###1202 1989 90-day study.
###1204 And one might go,
###1206 "Well, are we just doing infinite Do loops
###1208 on studies?"  The answer is no.
###1210 We were guided by a lot of the, uh,
###1212 a lot of the policy and legislation
###1214 of the day, but the whole purpose
###1216 is to create an integrated human space flight
###1218 architecture that really
###1220 helped us make smart decisions. Not only
###1222 as an agency, but as a country
###1224 and as a global community
###1226 uh, to, uh inform our
###1228 strategy and so that's what I'm going to tell you about.
###1230 Share a little about that.
###1232 Context -- I think you have to
###1234 have a context in the political
###1236 sense.  We had the Augustine Committee in '09,
###1238 In '10 we had the National Space Policy,
###1240 very directive toward
###1242 international partnerships, US industrial
###1244 base, inter-agency collaboration
###1246 and cooperation, commercial
###1248 engagement.  As we look
###1250 at the Human Exploration Framework Team,
###1252 we did, uh, we did two different
###1254 groups or two different phases of that.
###1256 Along, uh,
###1258 during, right in smack dab of the middle
###1260 of the second one, we had the NASA Authorization Act,
###1262 that was passed.  And, you know
###1264 it states that the long term goal is to expand
###1266 human presence, permanent human presence
###1268 beyond low Earth orbit, and to do so
###1270 involving our IPs,
###1272 our international partners, as practicable.
###1274 Along there, we also have this
###1276 ongoing effort, but we also now have
###1278 a continuing resolution
###1280 that we just got passed,
###1282 uh, for FY11.
###1284 So, essentially, this body
###1286 I think people, I think people
###1288 thought that we had the ability to
###1290 or were setting the
###1292 absolute concrete plan.  No, essentially
###1294 what we were doing is
###1296 doing the work to cue it up so that the
###1298 agency, so that the Congress,
###1300 so that the White House, can
###1302 have informed, uh,
###1304 informed set ups, and we can
###1306 make those smart decisions
###1308 in a timely fashion.  And, I think
###1310 the number one thing that people
###1312 are looking at is, "Hey, what is our
###1314 path, and let's all
###1316 get on board and start executing
###1318 that, because we are truly at a critical
###1320 time in history."  So,
###1322 um, a little bit of guidance.
###1324 This is a huge word chart.
###1326 Many of these are so vetted,
###1328 so scrubbed, by
###1330 folks that it's just not even worth trying to
###1332 change them. I'll just hit the highlights
###1334 Essentially, affrodability has gotta be a huge driver
###1336 Second one, I think
###1338 many, especially in the younger generation
###1340 here, will resonate with the second one.
###1342 We gotta reward value
###1344 conscious performance, take prudent risk
###1346 assumption, look at bold innovation,
###1348 harness the can-do attitude.
###1350 We've, we're an agency
###1352 of can-do and we need
###1354 to continue and build upon that and evolve.
###1356 Um, this,
###1358 this stems all the way from
###1360 the very newest
###1362 ranks, our 10-week, uh,
###1364 our 10-week people, all the way
###1366 to our, our senior
###1368 executives, all the way to
###1370 the administrator and the associate administrators
###1372 taking that bull by the horns.
###1374 And, we need to build and
###1376 apply on everything that we've learned over
###1378 the past 53 plus years of human space
###1380 flight experience,
###1382 yet still seek out new innovative ways.
###1384 So, marry the best
###1386 of both and then leverage our
###1388 assets and our people appropriately.
###1390 But, that doesn't mean
###1392 that we keep everything, because
###1394 we have a huge
###1396 resource burden, and we need to be
###1398 smart and have that requirements driven.
###1400 So, here's, here's a couple of
###1402 the principles.
###1404 Do a routine cadence, and do a routine cadence at
###1406 first.  So have it, keep it
###1408 sold, if you will.  Have it be a
###1410 regular set.  Build upon those
###1412 capabilities, we already talked about that.
###1414 It's gotta fit within the budget.
###1416 That's almost like a "duh."  We can't
###1418 be, uh, we can't developing
###1420 plans that aren't
###1422 executable, given the fiscal constraints that we have.
###1424 And, it's not gonna get that much better.
###1426 But, that doesn't mean, I mean
###1428 we still got, uh,
###1430 $18.485 billion,
###1432 um, going for us.
###1434 We can do a heck of a lot
###1436 for that. We've got to leverage
###1438 the international space station, we've got a $100 billion
###1440 asset.  Just the prudent, right thing to do
###1442 and we can use it as a stepping stone with our
###1444 international partners as well.
###1446 We gotta have a balance here between execution
###1448 and technology development,
###1450 leverage commonality and evolutionary approach.
###1452 Uh, we gotta, you know,
###1454 this fight between humans and robots,
###1456 that's, that's, that's
###1458 that's a fallacy, we gotta have both
###1460 and optimize the best.
###1462 And then, uh, we gotta leverage
###1464 our non-NASA capabilities, whether
###1466 they be the DOD or the Department of Energy
###1468 or academia, or industry.
###1470 And, we gotta stop
###1472 having NASA unique
###1474 supply chains and new facilities
###1476 such that, we
###1478 carry the burden of those solely.
###1480 So we need to look
###1482 in a smart sense there.  And then, develop
###1484 the best practices, wherever
###1486 uh, we see those.   Uh, truly to be
###1488 world-class, you gotta be, uh,
###1490 you gotta be a world-class adopter.
###1492 So, HEFT, essentially,
###1494 we got together, we did a
###1496 we, uh, we established a framework
###1498 uh, it's called the
###1500 capability-driven framework.
###1502 And essentially, it's all geared to do one thing:
###1504 to weather the political and economic
###1506 dynamics and to actually achieve
###1508 a cohesive, long term
###1510 multi-destination, integrated
###1512 approach to human space flight.
###1514 And, so I think
###1516 we'll explain how we believe that this does
###1518 create a safe, affordable and sustainable
###1520 approach to that.
###1522 It was hugely iterative, we did
###1524 lots of technical design and reference missions,
###1526 you cross those with investment strategies
###1528 it shows the options.  It's not
###1530 just one single path.  Somebody mentioned,
###1532 you know, "Could we have multiple paths
###1534 and maybe all are viable?"  Well that's absolutely true
###1536 here.  And, as we look at that,
###1538 we developed, "What do you need to go do those?"
###1540 Those element catalogs are
###1542 the resultant of that.  Then we looked
###1544 at the cost and the schedule to
###1546 develop each of those, both the development,
###1548 the fixed and the recurring, the production
###1550 and operations, looked at the phasing.
###1552 And, really, ultimately,
###1554 that yielded an integrated
###1556 program schedule and flight manifest.
###1558 Was it ever right the first time?
###1560 Absolutely not.  Why?
###1562 Because it needs to be optimized
###1564 and iterated.  And when we usually saw
###1566 that budgets spit out, the raw
###1568 budget numbers in terms of a sand chart,
###1570 it didn't all fit in the box.  So that's why
###1572 I say up at the top, it was highly iterative.
###1574 Yet, from this,
###1576 we distilled out, hey, what are our
###1578 key technology priorities?  What are our key
###1580 stakeholder concerns?  How did we meet those?
###1582 And we, you know, we checked our homework
###1584 along the way.
###1586 So, this capability-driven framework
###1588 that resulted out this is,
###1590 it said, "Hey, we're going to use these common elements
###1592 these things that we developed, we're not gonna just
###1594 go one destination and
###1596 and have the stuff not be applicable
###1598 or, or, have it be a
###1600 dead end.  No, we're gonna look at
###1602 that across all the design reference
###1604 missions and see where, see where
###1606 we have commonality."  Turns out,
###1608 as we look at the con ops, the contingencies
###1610 and aborts are actually driving
###1612 of the, uh, of
###1614 many of, uh many of the
###1616 requirements here.  So, it's not just the nominal missions,
###1618 it's actually going to do them
###1620 and looking at the aborts and
###1622 contingencies as the key drivers.
###1624 And, ultimately, we, this allows
###1626 us to play with the
###1628 cost and the schedule,
###1630 phasing a bit.
###1632 Essentially, in the past, we
###1634 haven't had an ability to say "Hey,
###1636 as you get increments or decrements in budget
###1638 what does that do to you?"
###1640 We used to have, OK you get a
###1642 10% budget, what does that to your
###1644 plans to go to the Moon.  Well,
###1646 it'd bad, but how bad?
###1648 Now, we have a prioritized list
###1650 where we say, "Hey, as you decrement the budget,
###1652 here's the priorities, we already
###1654 have the list.  Here's what we won't be doing.  Is that
###1656 acceptable from a political ramification
###1658 or from a national end resultant?"
###1660 Or, similarly, or conversely,
###1662 as you, as
###1664 you say, "I'd like to go to
###1666 do this, or as we increment
###1668 the budget, what's available,
###1670 what can you do?"  We will show
###1672 with already preset
###1674 priorities, "Hey, here's what we'll do,
###1676 here's what we can deliver for that."  So, it's a great
###1678 kind of contract, uh,
###1680 so from the financial sense
###1682 it's a great way to have
###1684 more ability to
###1686 communicate exactly what you give and get.
###1688 This is,
###1690 this is kind of a very tough
###1692 chart.  It shows the whole
###1694 enchilada.  You see out there in red
###1696 Mars missions is the ultimate horizon
###1698 destination.  What you see is
###1700 in blue is each of those
###1702 candidate, uh, those candidate destinations
###1704 in a multi-destination
###1706 exploration approach.
###1708 The white things are the key capabilities
###1710 that you need to get there.
###1712 So, in terms of Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle
###1714 and a heavy lift launch vehicle,
###1716 uh, needed for going beyond
###1718 low Earth orbit.  Likewise,
###1720 you might get the
###1722 I'll point this out, you might get the impression
###1724 see this crew EVA Block 2 Suit,
###1726 you might get the impression that that's only
###1728 applicable for the Moon because of this
###1730 this, single way to
###1732 look at it. So, we made another one,
###1734 versus here as you see in purple, this
###1736 EVA suit, that planetary
###1738 surface suit is actually applicable to
###1740 the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids and
###1742 Mars as well, so you see it kind of segregates
###1744 by transportation architecture,
###1746 and destination architecture.
###1748 So this gives us the flexibility to go to multiple
###1750 places.  But, at the same time,
###1752 I think a common criticism is
###1754 "Well, this is a path to nowhere, is it not?
###1756 I mean, if we don't have a single destination,
###1758 aren't we looking at,
###1760 at, you know,
###1762 nothing or chaos?"
###1764 And, that's not true at all.  Essentially,
###1766 what we're trying to show
###1768 is that, by investing in these
###1770 capabilities and technologies
###1772 we can enable multiple
###1774 places and depending upon
###1776 the, uh,
###1778 political or economic or national will,
###1780 we can go get
###1782 uh, we can go achieve
###1784 um, these
###1786 mission objectives with this approach.
###1788 Uh, notionally,
###1790 this just gives you a snapshot of some of the architecture.
###1792 You know, people always say,
###1794 "You're talking fairly, uh,
###1796 fairly high level."  These are just a snapshot--
###1798 notional pics of some of the elements
###1800 uh, across all the
###1802 multi-destination approach, that uh,
###1804 we looked at.  You see the launch vehicle, the crew vehicle,
###1806 the cyropropulsion stage
###1808 solar electric propulsion, a lander,
###1810 Mars surface systems,
###1812 the two different types of suits, launch and entry
###1814 or planetary, uh,
###1816 a notional depiction of a space
###1818 exploration vehicle, uh,
###1820 and some robotics, uh,
###1822 and then a kick stage.
###1824 This, uh, these charts are all public
###1826 but what I wanted to show you, soup to nuts
###1828 across the top, low
###1830 Earth orbit, all the way to Mars surface.
###1832 Kind of a crescendo of increasingly
###1834 challenging, uh,
###1836 destinations or capabilities.
###1838 Down on the left
###1840 is a range of technologies
###1842 that are needed.  What you see is
###1844 is white -- we pretty much non-applicable
###1846 we don't need to do tech dev there,
###1848 veruses in the green, we absolutely do.
###1850 You see, that first four columns
###1852 you got a nice, we got a nice column there
###1854 not a lot of, not so much green,
###1856 well, that's kind of a, that's kind of a
###1858 good check, we already went to the Moon,
###1860 we did a lunar surface stay for less than
###1862 seven days.  But, as you extend beyond
###1864 that it shows you that indeed,
###1866 we gotta do
###1868 for Near Earth Asteroids, longer duration lunar
###1870 surface stays and
###1872 Mars, we've got a lot of investment to do.
###1874 And, so this a, it's a
###1876 compelling driver for that.  This shows the same,
###1878 just a little bit more technologies.
###1880 But, we're using
###1882 the international space station as the
###1884 cornerstone of our human space flight ops.
###1886 It's a great test bed, it's great for risk reduction,
###1888 building off those partnerships.
###1890 And, here's how we're going.
###1892 We're taking that framework,
###1894 these are a lot of the elements, or
###1896 the building blocks that it takes to get there,
###1898 these are the cross-cutting systems or
###1900 capabilities that we need to have,
###1902 in order to enable those.  And, here's how
###1904 we're getting them through technologies, research,
###1906 science.  And, it's the melding of
###1908 of, the Science Mission Directorate's work
###1910 it's the melding of the
###1912 Office of the Chief Technologist's technology development work.
###1914 ESMD and SOMD, as we
###1916 merge through the human exploration and
###1918 operations directorate, that's how it's all
###1920 gonna work.  And, it's all about
###1922 partnerships.  And, these are not just international,
###1924 but also inter-agency and commercial.
###1926 Ones that expand, or
###1928 allow us to do things that we wouldn't have done
###1930 otherwise, or enable
###1932 meaning, if an international
###1934 partner brings something, we might have planned it
###1936 but, it might have been for 10 or 15 years
###1938 down the line.  If they bring it, we'll be able
###1940 to do that sooner.  To those that
###1942 enhance smaller agencies.
###1944 Uh, new
###1946 and developing countries
###1948 uh, they can each play a role
###1950 and there's a piece of the puzzle for everyone.
###1952 Um, this is
###1954 emblematic of some of the themes
###1956 and the common goals.
###1958 Essentially, these are the five themes
###1960 that the 14 countries who participate
###1962 in the international space exploration
###1964 coordination group are
###1966 working together on.  These are what they agree on.
###1968 Exploration is about a
###1970 sustained presence, for extending human
###1972 frontiers, uh, new knowledge
###1974 in science and technology, economic
###1976 expansion, global partnerships, and
###1978 inspiration and education.
###1980 And those below,
###1982 also further refine,
###1984 um, further refine
###1986 and reflect the collective
###1988 um, objectives of the international community.
###1990 Um,
###1992 I think all too often people say,
###1994 "Well, you know, give us some examples."
###1996 Well, those are the 14 countries.
###1998 Uh, each of their symbols
###2000 uh, displayed up above.
###2002 And they do include
###2004 Russia, they do include China,
###2006 Japan, Europe,
###2008 you see Korea,
###2010 and several other nations.
###2012 From an inter-agency perspective,
###2014 we're working with the Department of Defense
###2016 the intelligence community, the FAA
###2018 Department of Energy, National Science Foundation
###2020 Department of Homeland Security,
###2022 uh, NIST, you name it.
###2024 Um, and those are a couple of examples
###2026 of how we're working. Same thing
###2028 on the commercial.  We talked about the
###2030 traditional aerospace, the entrepreneurial
###2032 and the non-traditional
###2034 previously.
###2036 So, we already talked about
###2038 afforability being a big driver.
###2040 We're looking at that soup to nuts.
###2042 We're applying the
###2044 skunk works capabilities.
###2046 We're looking at our insight and oversight,
###2048 our contracting models, our requirement
###2050 systems, our governance.
###2052 Across the board, Dan Dumbacher and
###2054 team are trying to really
###2056 embrace this in our traditional development
###2058 as well as trying to adopt
###2060 new ways of doing things.
###2062 Um, we met
###2064 with 25 different industry groups,
###2066 or businesses,
###2068 we took their inputs, and this is
###2070 kind of a smattering
###2072 uh, a smattering of their feedback
###2074 and results.  You know,
###2076 test and fly often,
###2078 systems engineering is critically
###2080 important, push decision authority
###2082 to the lowest level, maintain aggressive
###2084 schedules, manage,
###2086 keep it simple.  And, you know, I think this
###2088 resonates with some of the other things that you've heard.
###2090 And, I think the bottom
###2092 line is, that if we have
###2094 some focused and realistic and stable requirements,
###2096 with capable, and
###2098 connected, and properly incentivized teams
###2100 and schedules--
###2102 NASA does its best work
###2104 it seems
###2106 on challenging schedules--
###2108 that helps all precipitate low cost,
###2110 highly successful results.
###2112 So, key takeaways
###2114 out of HEFT.
###2116 Uh, capability-driven framework is
###2118 probably one of the major efforts
###2120 uh, NASA-wide transformational changes
###2122 is gonna be important, and I think we
###2124 have the leadership who is
###2126 ready to embrace that and
###2128 has been.  Um,
###2130 engaging in that
###2132 activity fairly vigorously.
###2134 Um, SLS
###2136 and MPCV are the core
###2138 first elements.
###2140 We do need to invest in some of our long term
###2142 capabilities.  Robotic precursors
###2144 are necessary if we're gonna actually go to
###2146 a NEA.  Um,
###2148 this is a fundamental change
###2150 but I believe it's, uh,
###2152 it's the right approach.  And not
###2154 so ironically, uh,
###2156 when we briefed the Russians
###2158 after 18 months of studying
###2160 uh, recently unveiled, I briefed this for
###2162 two and half hours, they briefed their
###2164 two hour deal
###2166 And they said, "Hey, we have a capability driven
###2168 framework and we want to work collaboratively."
###2170 And, I was actually shocked.
###2172 And, I talked to, uh,
###2174 I talked to, uh, talked to their folks afterward
###2176 and they said, "Why would you be surprised?"
###2178 We have the same political and economic
###2180 dynamics, this is just a reflection
###2182 of that and it's probably the modern paradigm
###2184 going forward, because no agency,
###2186 no single entity, can afford to
###2188 do beyond LEO exploration, uh,
###2190 alone.  And, so, last but not least,
###2192 uh,
###2194 this last one is a
###2196 Bryan O'Conner-ism, our
###2198 Chief Safety and Mission Assurance Officer.
###2200 We gotta have compelling, overarching mission
###2202 goals necessary to justify
###2204 the risks we're taking and the resources we're
###2206 laying out.  And that's
###2208 what it's all about, is laying that long term vector--
###2210 boots on Mars, sustained human
###2212 presence.  So,
###2214 In the next
###2216 3 minutes, I'll just say, OK,
###2218 that's HEFT.  Now we've been continuing
###2220 on, we had a framework-- human exploration
###2222 framework-- now this is
###2224 the human architecture team
###2226 this is what's building it.  It's
###2228 cross agency, multi-disciplinary.
###2230 We're working the international,
###2232 we're working the multi-destinations.
###2234 Um,
###2236 Recent activities have been
###2238 helping, uh, refine the requirements for
###2240 SLS and MPCV.
###2242 We are working on a margins policy,
###2244 and this is not the programmatic margins policy,
###2246 but the architecture wide
###2248 approach. We've, uh,
###2250 we've been refining our international
###2252 exploration road map, for the
###2254 reasons I mentioned previously.
###2256 And, we're updating our technology prioritization.
###2258 This shows you how
###2260 we've got now a
###2262 cycle, a cadence of, this is an
###2264 ongoing, evolutionary
###2266 uh, sustained architecture
###2268 effort for the agency.  We're meshing up
###2270 with the program milestones and the
###2272 international milestones. And,
###2274 you, know, this is what we've done over
###2276 the past, we're now looking at a crew of four
###2278 for all missions, but
###2280 geoservicing mission.  Why?
###2282 Because we get more international
###2284 offsets there, because we get a two person
###2286 EVA capability,
###2288 uh, by doing so.
###2290 We've been looking at crew
###2292 access to geostationary
###2294 LEO for servicing missions.
###2296 We've been looking at, uh,
###2298 at a balance of heavy lift and
###2300 and, uh, expendable launch vehicles.
###2302 And so, a balance between commercial and government.
###2304 We've looked at, uh,
###2306 some of our Near Earth Asteroid
###2308 missions and we've also looked at a little bit of the
###2310 Phobos/Deimos.
###2312 These, these
###2314 are the design
###2316 reference missions.  This is a total org chart.
###2318 It's intended to be put in there
###2320 because you see everything
###2322 in vivid detail is, uh.
###2324 We've got one for
###2326 low Earth orbit utilization,
###2328 uh, HEO/GEO vicinity
###2330 with and without
###2332 predeployment of assets and resources
###2334 there.  Uh, lunar vicinity,
###2336 low lunar, lunar surface,
###2338 uh, minimum and
###2340 full capability, Near Earth Asteroids
###2342 all the way out to Mars landing.
###2344 And you see the ones, that uh,
###2346 we've been emphasizing and
###2348 uh, and not, based upon the coloration.
###2350 So, um,
###2352 this is what's ahead.
###2354 We're working on currently
###2356 our min equipment lists,
###2358 we're looking at the impacts of the
###2360 uh, this four person crew
###2362 uh, taking a look at those driving
###2364 priorities, uh, for the
###2366 technologies, focusing on the
###2368 destinations ahead.
###2370 I don't think I need to spend any time
###2372 on that.  We now have
###2374 both destination and
###2376 element leads.  So this means, we've got
###2378 a person or a couple of people who are
###2380 bellybuttons for each one of these.
###2382 So, it
###2384 helps address the challenge that
###2386 this isn't just, this
###2388 isn't just a chaos and a
###2390 destination to nowhere.
###2392 We have specific focal points who
###2394 own all the work, so we have
###2396 one-stop shopping for
###2398 Near Earth Asteroids or Moon,
###2400 or Mars and, uh,
###2402 we have a single bellybutton that
###2404 we can leverage on those.
###2406 Plus, we have elements leads for each one of these,
###2408 so as we look at developing commonalities,
###2410 strategies, or as we look at
###2412 saying, "How can we leverage the development
###2414 dollars we're spending?"
###2416 We'll have a single bellybutton to push on for that.
###2418 And, so, getting back to
###2420 engagement.  We have
###2422 a ten center team.
###2424 These are some of the people you see for the destination
###2426 in Space, Lunar, Near
###2428 Earth Objects or Near Earth Asteroids and
###2430 Mars.  And,
###2432 likewise, for the element team support, you can
###2434 see each one of those functional areas
###2436 and the people.  But, these are just
###2438 the focal leads and I highly encourage
###2440 every single one of you guys
###2442 to engage: young, middle
###2444 old-- everybody.
###2446 Uh, this is our future.
###2448 This is how we collectively
###2450 uh, harness that going forth.
###2452 So, bottom line is, we are
###2454 we are absolutely
###2456 looking forward to a robust future.
###2458 Our best days are not behind us.
###2460 We've had some incredible ones,
###2462 but our best days are before us.
###2464 And it's about extending and imagining
###2466 and bringing to fruition
###2468 uh, a
###2470 sustained human presence beyond a
###2472 low Earth orbit.  We've got the bucks to do so.
###2474 It's not unlimited dollars, but
###2476 that's a great thing.
###2478 It's enough to get the job done and we need to
###2480 go do it.  We need to be safe and
###2482 affordable.  We've got some significant
###2484 progress.  We're not starting from
###2486 scratch.  We're kick and start.
###2488 We've kick started at building off
###2490 of shuttle, station and constellation.
###2492 Um, and, uh,
###2494 our next challenge is to
###2496 execute.  And, I think
###2498 that brings, uh, I think that brings
###2500 uh, everything into bright
###2502 focus. So,
###2504 um, I would just like to say is,
###2506 is the prospects for the
###2508 future I believe are truly awesome.
###2510 And so, with that, I would like to
###2512 um, turn it over next to
###2514 Garry, who will give you
###2516 uh, a very detailed
###2518 and no doubt, riveting
###2520 set of insights into the
###2522 SLS game plan.
