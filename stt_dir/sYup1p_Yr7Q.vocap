###15 MIKE RUBENDALL: Keep these bugs away.
###19 Show them how it pumps.
###23 It's funny, because when I got into tattooing, it was at a
###27 strange stage in my life.
###28 Because I was 17, and growing up I
###34 guess made good decisions.
###36 I did well in school and was heavily into sports, and I
###39 chose a different path, which was tattooing.
###41 And everybody looked at me like, you've done so well up
###44 until this point.
###45 And now you're going to hang out with all these fuck-ups
###47 and devil worshipping, drug dealing, motorcycle riding
###50 type of guys-- so what are you doing with your life?
###54 So at the time, nobody thought it was a really good idea.
###57 Now I'm 33 years old, and they look at me like maybe it
###60 wasn't such a bad idea.
###62 
###78 FRANK ROMANO: There's a group of people leading the pack.
###85 FRANK ROMANO: Oh, absolutely.
###86 I mean, recently, talking to one of the guys at the shop
###89 about this, he said, do you think Mike's
###91 in the top 10 guys?
###93 And I said, yeah.
###95 Name nine guys that are better than him.
###99 And I'm not looking to hurt anybody's feelings, but I
###102 think it's closer to the top five.
###104 And we agreed, yeah, maybe it's not even the top 10.
###107 Maybe it's the top five.
###109 MIKE RUBENDALL: You want a pillow?
###110 MALE SPEAKER: Nah.
###111 MIKE RUBENDALL: You got to wait 'til noon 'til the shop
###112 help gets in here though.
###113 MALE SPEAKER: Nah, that's fine.
###116 MIKE RUBENDALL: I've always described my tattooing as
###118 Asian influenced.
###120 I think I have a contemporary approach on traditional
###126 Japanese tattoo style.
###129 Overall look, I want my tattoos to be timeless.
###133 I want it to be beautiful as the day I
###136 did it 20 years later.
###138 I don't want somebody to look at my tattoos and know what
###141 year or whatever I did it in.
###142 MATT BRECKERICH: It's exciting to look at-- detailed and
###145 simple at the same time.
###147 Exciting, action packed.
###150 That's what I said the other day.
###151 
###154 JUSTIN WEATHERHOLTZ: He has that extra little bit of
###157 edginess to it that always kind of grabbed me.
###160 Even the way he does his compositions and stuff, an
###163 overall look I guess.
###165 CHRIS O'DONNELL: He still does all kinds of subject matter.
###169 It was pretty much centered around doing a good quality
###173 job for the person that comes in the door.
###175 He's not like, I'm going to try this crazy thing, and if
###178 it doesn't work, it doesn't.
###179 He's like, no, this person wants this, and this is what
###182 they're going to get.
###182 I'm going to add a lot to that, but it's going to be in
###186 the nuances, in the progression
###188 of my drawing ability.
###191 And people respond to that.
###194 The whole process is his personality.
###198 It's very structured and very right.
###202 He'll show up when he's supposed to show up.
###204 He'll work really hard.
###205 He'll do the research, he'll have the drawing, he'll have
###207 it all thought out, takes it very seriously, and
###211 he'll do a great job.
###214 MIKE RUBENDALL: I'll even chase my clients, like, can
###216 you come in for a consultation?
###217 Can we talk about what you're getting?
###219 I want to be prepared.
###220 I don't want you to show up and me draw it on the spot.
###222 I don't work well like that.
###225 It's possible I could do a tattoo like that, but I don't
###228 feel like they're getting my best.
###231 When the time comes to do the tattoo, then I try to knock it
###234 out of park.
###236 Even little stuff, they'll come in, and I said, any of
###241 the guys in the shop are more than capable of doing this.
###243 You don't need to wait for me, they'll do an outstanding job.
###247 And they're like, no, we've been watching you a long time,
###250 and we just want a piece from you.
###254 I was born and raised in Massapequa, New York.
###257 It's a small town on Long Island.
###260 I think I had an average upbringing.
###262 I came from a middle-class family.
###266 I think I stayed in Massapequa because I felt very
###269 comfortable there.
###270 I had this mentality that if you build it, they will come.
###273 So I felt like why not be in a place that I grew up in, that
###277 I feel most comfortable in, and I know the most people?
###280 I felt like I could open up in my mother's basement and
###284 people would still come and get tattooed by me-- luckily,
###287 I was fortunate for that.
###288 
###300 JOE PAPPALARDO JR.: I think there was a lot of hesitation
###303 about putting a tattoo shop in that area because it's so
###305 residential.
###306 I think he had to meet with a lot of people and show them
###308 his credentials.
###308 And show them he wasn't going to have people pulling up on
###312 their bikes at all hours of the night
###313 and doing drugs outside--
###315 that he has a respectable clientele.
###316 I mean, he's tattooed celebrities.
###318 His rates are weaning away people of
###322 that element, I think.
###323 
###327 MATT BRECKERICH: Kings Avenue in Massapequa, it's known as
###331 kind of the classy tattoo shop.
###332 You know, the shop that we're hardworking, we have our shit
###335 together, and I would like to think we're known as the best
###338 of the best around here.
###340 
###343 GREZ: Working in Long Island, it was a shock of how things
###348 were done compared to Boston.
###349 In Long Island, they want to get tattooed, and
###352 they want it done.
###353 They come in and OK, I'll make 15 appointments to get my
###356 sleeve, I'll do it every two weeks.
###358 It's a dream.
###360 MALE SPEAKER: The clientele here is actually pretty open
###362 to bigger work.
###364 You've got big, huge pieces on a lot of people running around
###367 here, it's pretty crazy.
###370 MIKE RUBENDALL: I remembered I tattooed a few guys that were
###372 starting big projects like a sleeve, and
###375 they lost their jobs.
###376 So I would start the conversation by so, what do
###380 you do for a living?
###380 And the guy would be like, I just lost my job.
###383 And I'm like, you sure you want to get into this?
###385 It's a big commitment, a lot of time and money.
###389 And they're like no, I need to do this.
###391 They fucking want this, no matter what.
###394 MATT BRECKERICH: My theory on that is that a lot of these
###396 people around here, family guys, they don't go out to the
###399 bar, they got kids.
###401 So it's almost like that's their way of doing something
###404 cool that makes them feel alive, I guess.
###407 GREZ: One guy came in once, and he wanted Mike to do a
###409 sleeve on him.
###410 And he's like, oh, I don't know, I want some fucking
###412 demon or something.
###414 So he brings in a Lord of the Rings picture of-- you know
###418 that guy that whips Gandalf, the guy made of fire and he
###421 pulls him down into the pit or whatever?
###424 He brings that in and Mike does a Fudo sleeve on the guy.
###428 The guy, he sees the fire and he's like fuck yeah.
###431 He was just kind of like joking around a little bit,
###433 and I looked down at him and I go, you don't even know what
###436 that is on your arm, do you?
###437 And he goes, psh, yeah I do.
###439 I go, OK, what is that?
###441 He goes, it's fondue.
###443 And Mike and I lost it.
###447 They see your tattoos for what they in a quality sense.
###452 But a lot of times it's your job to incorporate more
###455 interesting aspects into the tattoo that tell a story for
###459 other people that are viewing it.
###460 
###464 JOE PAPPALARDO JR.: People he knows and that he does a lot
###466 of work on, he pushes it.
###467 Because I think--
###469 I'll use myself as an example.
###471 For my back, I told him I wanted
###472 a hani with a spiderweb.
###474 I mean, my hani doesn't look like a typical hani I think he
###476 just went for it.
###479 In my mind, he'd the artist, he's doing what he's doing.
###481 I think he has the most fun when people kind of approach
###484 it that way.
###484 I'm sure a lot of these tattoo artists do, they don't want to
###486 be told what to do, they're artists.
###489 They want to push it, they want to go.
###490 
###495 I don't know if he has a favorite piece.
###497 I know whenever I see him, I'm always kind of blown away.
###499 Like, the other day he was doing a Phoenix that
###501 I thought was cool.
###501 Like it was just deep purples and stuff.
###505 I always like-- he does great stuff with heads.
###508 Someone he was doing a leg sleeve on, it was like seven
###510 severed heads.
###511 It was just gory and raw, and I think he was just
###513 having fun with it.
###516 I grew up with Mike, I know Mike, I know he's an awesome
###519 tattoo artist.
###519 To see it in a different setting, really kind of go,
###522 holy cow, this guy's a name.
###524 And I'm great friends with him.
###525 He's like almost a celebrity in this little circle.
###529 GREZ: One thing I've observed about Mike is that he always
###532 continues to have
###534 relationships with these people.
###535 Because he's got the mayor feel.
###537 He knows everyone's name, shaking everyone's hands.
###542 I was working one day at the shop, the door opens and I
###544 hear, Mikey!
###546 And I look up, I'm like, that's Steve Guttenberg.
###550 I remember him from Police Academy, and he's walking
###554 around looking for Mike.
###554 MIKE RUBENDALL: Him and his dad came into the shop to get
###557 matching tattoos, and his mother found out--
###563 oh, look at this.
###564 There they are!
###565 Holy shit.
###568 Speak of the devil.
###569 JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: Hey!
###570 MIKE RUBENDALL: Look at this.
###571 JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: Are you filming for your
###573 documentary right now?
###573 MIKE RUBENDALL: Yeah, right now, baby.
###574 JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: All right, you want to go to the
###575 pizza shop?
###575 MIKE RUBENDALL: Sure.
###576 STEVE GUTTENBERG: Mikey boy.
###576 MIKE RUBENDALL: How you doing, buddy?
###577 JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: Steve, you got five minutes?
###578 MIKE RUBENDALL: You got a minute?
###578 JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: They're doing a tattoo documentary.
###579 STEVE GUTTENBERG: Tattoo on you?
###580 MIKE RUBENDALL: Say a couple of kind words?
###582 JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: Yeah, you're the guy, Massapequa.
###584 STEVE GUTTENBERG: I got to lie.
###586 Oh, no.
###586 MIKE RUBENDALL: You got to lie?
###587 STEVE GUTTENBERG: Mikey, you look great man.
###589 You look terriffic.
###589 MIKE RUBENDALL: You, too, man.
###590 How's everything?
###590 STEVE GUTTENBERG: It's good.
###591 I'll see you at the shop.
###593 MIKE RUBENDALL: OK, cool.
###593 JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: This is the first place
###594 that Michael worked.
###595 Came in a young man, what, 15 years old, Mike?
###597 MIKE RUBENDALL: Yeah.
###598 JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: 15 years old, [INAUDIBLE]
###600 Mike Rubendall.
###601 MALE SPEAKER: Hey, Mike.
###602 MIKE RUBENDALL: What's up, Frank?
###603 How are you man?
###603 Good to see you.
###605 JOE PAPPALARDO, SR.: Larry's our manager here, he told me
###608 not to hire Michael Rubendall.
###610 I don't know why.
###611 Why is that, Larry?
###612 LARRY: I don't know.
###613 GREZ: It's like he hasn't burned any bridges.
###615 All the people he grew up with, they all still live in
###618 Long Island.
###618 He remembers everyone, he takes care of everybody.
###621 MIKE RUBENDALL: Yo, Ed!
###623 ED: Mike!
###624 MIKE RUBENDALL: My man.
###625 ED: Welcome to New York.
###626 MIKE RUBENDALL: You're back?
###626 GREZ: You know, some of the characters that he hangs out
###628 with are so entertaining.
###629 MIKE RUBENDALL: This guy's a legend.
###632 Say something to the camera.
###633 ED: Next time I get a tattoo, it's going to be a pizza pie
###637 right on my arm, Mikey Rubendall style.
###641 GREZ: It's incredible how much he brings from the world to
###645 Massapequa.
###646 
###648 It's special, because we have the train there
###651 and all these people--
###652 the taxi cab drivers.
###653 Every time our clients would come in, it's like oh my God,
###655 this taxi cab driver is chewing my ear off about how
###658 he brought three people from Europe last week and two
###661 people from California.
###662 None of them can believe that so many people
###664 travel just for a tattoo.
###665 MALE SPEAKER: You said that you've taken some people to
###667 the tattoo parlor before?
###668 JUAN SUAREZ: I take a lot of people there.
###672 When they come in, I usually ask them
###674 where do you come from?
###676 Oh, from the city, one guy Pennsylvania, another guy from
###680 some different places.
###683 Yeah, we do, we do--
###684 we drop them off, pick them up, I know the place by heart.
###689 MIKE RUBENDALL: It's flattering because people come
###692 all over the world.
###693 And people live down the block from the shop, and they're
###697 just happy to get tattooed.
###699 Some of them don't even know how successful the shop is, or
###703 that the job is world renowned, or that people come
###706 in from all over the world.
###707 They're just like, oh, he's local, he does a good job,
###710 he's a nice guy.
###711 That's all we need, the simple life.
###714
