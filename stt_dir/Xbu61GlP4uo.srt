Life Wisdom. Psychetruth Massage.


2
0:0:7,83 --> 0:0:11,3
This is Athena Jezik and today we're going to work from the floor a


3
0:0:11,3 --> 0:0:15,379
little bit to benefit those of you that
don't have a table or those of you that


4
0:0:15,379 --> 0:0:18,829
aren't in it professionally who just want to do it with your


5
0:0:18,829 --> 0:0:20,81
friends and family.


6
0:0:20,81 --> 0:0:22,439
One of the things


7
0:0:22,439 --> 0:0:25,869
that is important is that the person on
the floor is comfortable some kind of a


8
0:0:25,869 --> 0:0:27,759
little padding or cushion


9
0:0:27,759 --> 0:0:28,909
is nice


10
0:0:28,909 --> 0:0:33,179
it's not a good idea necessarily to work
from a bed because the bed sinks


11
0:0:33,179 --> 0:0:37,519
down and you don't get the nice solidness underneath. This is similar to the 


12
0:0:37,519 --> 0:0:38,77
table.


13
0:0:38,77 --> 0:0:42,35
The other thing is I'm going to explain some
what how that mechanics need to be for


14
0:0:42,35 --> 0:0:45,13
the person doing the massage because
there is


15
0:0:45,13 --> 0:0:50,2
uh... it's a lot harder to work from the floor for the therapist.


16
0:0:50,2 --> 0:0:51,89
So we'll start with the back


17
0:0:51,89 --> 0:0:55,38
and um... basically i'm just on my knees


18
0:0:55,38 --> 0:0:58,39



19
0:0:58,39 --> 0:1:7,9
So you'll be able to see how the body
is going to work a little bit.


20
0:1:7,9 --> 0:1:12,119
this is where it's important to have good
strength in your core if you're the one doing


21
0:1:12,119 --> 0:1:19,42
the work.


22
0:1:19,42 --> 0:1:21,71
Okay, just applying the oil...


23
0:1:21,71 --> 0:1:23,51
Now basically I work


24
0:1:23,51 --> 0:1:30,17
similar to what I would do from the
table.


25
0:1:30,17 --> 0:1:35,869
So i'm gonna start up here and 


26
0:1:35,869 --> 0:1:40,36
begin to work. Now here because there's
no face cradle the neck is turned


27
0:1:40,36 --> 0:1:44,1
so the muscles are gonna be in a little bit different position. There will be a shortening and a lengthening


28
0:1:44,1 --> 0:1:44,95



29
0:1:44,95 --> 0:1:48,82
but you can still basically work the same way


30
0:1:48,82 --> 0:1:55,1
spreading open the trapezius into the shoulder blades


31
0:1:55,1 --> 0:2:0,5
and you can glide down along side of the spine


32
0:2:0,5 --> 0:2:4,26
working through.


33
0:2:4,26 --> 0:2:9,699
Bringing your hands back up and spreading out and again.


34
0:2:9,699 --> 0:2:11,369
This is like a...


35
0:2:11,369 --> 0:2:18,79
I usually do this three times.


36
0:2:18,79 --> 0:2:19,939
No reason. Just


37
0:2:19,939 --> 0:2:21,5
that's what I do.


38
0:2:21,5 --> 0:2:25,4
I tend to move outside. I do one closer to the spine and then more in the  


39
0:2:25,4 --> 0:2:31,79
middle of the muscle and then on the edge, so that's really where I get my "three" from.


40
0:2:31,79 --> 0:2:35,259
The neck is very differently placed when it's turned.


41
0:2:35,259 --> 0:2:38,499
So you'll be able to notice just how
different that is. You can't really work the neck


42
0:2:38,499 --> 0:2:41,939
very well when it's turned.


43
0:2:41,939 --> 0:2:45,59
Okay so then to go down into this


44
0:2:45,59 --> 0:2:50,41
arms you have to reposition yourself by coming 


45
0:2:50,41 --> 0:2:53,219
over to the side


46
0:2:53,219 --> 0:2:55,779
and then beginning to work


47
0:2:55,779 --> 0:3:2,249
outward in this direction.


48
0:3:2,249 --> 0:3:5,349



49
0:3:5,349 --> 0:3:8,989
Around the shoulder blades. So all of this technique is really 


50
0:3:8,989 --> 0:3:12,26
the same.. similar I should say


51
0:3:12,26 --> 0:3:16,59
to what you're doing.


52
0:3:16,59 --> 0:3:19,799
I can already feel in my body


53
0:3:19,799 --> 0:3:22,819
the strain


54
0:3:22,819 --> 0:3:24,459
of the different


55
0:3:24,459 --> 0:3:32,809
position that has to be done.


56
0:3:32,809 --> 0:3:36,449
It's best to be on your knees, if possible high on your knees so you can


57
0:3:36,449 --> 0:3:38,849
move your body around.


58
0:3:38,849 --> 0:3:42,559
There's a little bit of twisting that goes on.


59
0:3:42,559 --> 0:3:55,479
And then of course we can rub back upward.


60
0:3:55,479 --> 0:3:59,89
And then working back down


61
0:3:59,89 --> 0:4:2,29
sliding the hands


62
0:4:2,29 --> 0:4:3,66
and repositioning


63
0:4:3,66 --> 0:4:4,6
myself.


64
0:4:4,6 --> 0:4:9,629
Now here I tend to put my leg up because then I can get


65
0:4:9,629 --> 0:4:13,369
a little bit more


66
0:4:13,369 --> 0:4:15,889
of a 


67
0:4:15,889 --> 0:4:17,569
direction on the


68
0:4:17,569 --> 0:4:18,859
muscles.


69
0:4:18,859 --> 0:4:22,659
It's a little bit easier to get when I'm higher


70
0:4:22,659 --> 0:4:25,649
than when I'm lower down.


71
0:4:25,649 --> 0:4:31,72
And working up


72
0:4:31,72 --> 0:4:42,24
again.


73
0:4:42,24 --> 0:4:46,58
And then


74
0:4:46,58 --> 0:4:52,83
to work across, lowering myself down.


75
0:4:52,83 --> 0:4:55,84
It's still staying fairly mobile.


76
0:4:55,84 --> 0:4:58,489
Still staying in a way that I can


77
0:4:58,489 --> 0:5:1,289
moves with the


78
0:5:1,289 --> 0:5:10,8
action of the massage work.


79
0:5:10,8 --> 0:5:13,6
So this is the basic


80
0:5:13,6 --> 0:5:15,0
routine that i've done


81
0:5:15,0 --> 0:5:16,61
many times over. I've been 


82
0:5:16,61 --> 0:5:19,349
doing this same basic routine for my


83
0:5:19,349 --> 0:5:24,129
entire massage career. It's a good
routine because it does cover


84
0:5:24,129 --> 0:5:31,84
everything. It moves from muscle to muscle very smoothly.


85
0:5:31,84 --> 0:5:35,249
And it just covers it all. It doesn't 


86
0:5:35,249 --> 0:5:39,379
leave anything out and i do recommend
that you find some routine that you can


87
0:5:39,379 --> 0:5:42,319
work because that way you get both sides of the body


88
0:5:42,319 --> 0:5:43,78
equally


89
0:5:43,78 --> 0:5:47,3
and if you have a routine, pretty soon that
becomes very


90
0:5:47,3 --> 0:5:48,919
much


91
0:5:48,919 --> 0:5:49,889
part of


92
0:5:49,889 --> 0:5:53,939
what you do and you don't have to think too much so you can concentrate on


93
0:5:53,939 --> 0:5:56,979
sensations that are under your hands.


94
0:5:56,979 --> 0:6:0,58
That's how you begin to work and understand the body more


95
0:6:0,58 --> 0:6:3,25
on an intuitive level.


96
0:6:3,25 --> 0:6:5,61
So we are just working there


97
0:6:5,61 --> 0:6:8,39
and back up


98
0:6:8,39 --> 0:6:10,3
and down. Okay and then


99
0:6:10,3 --> 0:6:16,74
let's start to the other side


100
0:6:16,74 --> 0:6:23,83
same thing.


101
0:6:23,83 --> 0:6:27,389
and of course this routine is
somewhat modified


102
0:6:27,389 --> 0:7:15,719
not a lot but there is some
modifications happening here.


103
0:7:15,719 --> 0:7:18,83



104
0:7:18,83 --> 0:7:25,699
Use the upper..pushing upward on these muscles near the hip.


105
0:7:25,699 --> 0:7:33,29
right along the hip edge


106
0:7:33,29 --> 0:7:40,849
and then up we go. This is another "threesome" thing that I do when I go up the spine.


107
0:7:40,849 --> 0:8:1,69
The spine has a little bit different movement when you're going upward or downward.


108
0:8:1,69 --> 0:8:5,8
And then coming back down and then working up across by her....


109
0:8:5,8 --> 0:8:26,819
across the erector spinae


110
0:8:26,819 --> 0:8:30,82
and then back up. Now for the vibration along the 


111
0:8:30,82 --> 0:8:33,82
vertebrae...


112
0:8:33,82 --> 0:8:37,99
You won't be able to start up at the base of the skull, so you'll start down here, about 


113
0:8:37,99 --> 0:8:38,79
C7.


114
0:8:38,79 --> 0:8:49,91
And vibrate down


115
0:8:49,91 --> 0:8:55,64
and then you can go back up


116
0:8:55,64 --> 0:8:56,83



117
0:8:56,83 --> 0:9:6,62
vibrate down, up


118
0:9:6,62 --> 0:9:12,1
and again and vibrating down...


119
0:9:12,1 --> 0:9:17,3
and back up. This is a little bit different than what I normally do when I'm working from a 


120
0:9:17,3 --> 0:9:21,31
table.


121
0:9:21,31 --> 0:9:27,75
Okay and I'm gonna switch to the other side and reach up here


122
0:9:27,75 --> 0:9:33,81
going between each vertebrae


123
0:9:33,81 --> 0:9:59,81



124
0:9:59,81 --> 0:10:5,25
Down to the sacrum, the SI joint...


125
0:10:5,25 --> 0:10:8,339
And then on the floor I do the


126
0:10:8,339 --> 0:10:11,74
body wrapping from both sides


127
0:10:11,74 --> 0:10:14,55
just pushing down the...


128
0:10:14,55 --> 0:10:16,72
downward


129
0:10:16,72 --> 0:10:27,17
downward, down through the ribs


130
0:10:27,17 --> 0:10:30,7
and then you can wrap back up


131
0:10:30,7 --> 0:10:34,76
and up


132
0:10:34,76 --> 0:10:36,94
upward


133
0:10:36,94 --> 0:10:39,3
and upward...


134
0:10:39,3 --> 0:10:44,38
And a nice finish by just bringing it up.


135
0:10:44,38 --> 0:10:47,2
And then little brushes to sweep.


136
0:10:47,2 --> 0:10:50,82
Okay so i hope that gave you some ideas


137
0:10:50,82 --> 0:10:57,18
for working on the floor.


138
0:10:57,18 --> 0:11:5,3



139
0:11:5,3 --> 0:11:30,7



140
0:11:30,7 --> 0:11:35,33



141
0:11:35,33 --> 0:11:50,31



142
0:11:50,31 --> 0:13:50,31
